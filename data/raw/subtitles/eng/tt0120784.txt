1
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,554
GSW.

2
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:31,391
That's what the hospitals call it.

3
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,935
Gunshot wound.

4
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:38,148
Doctor has to report it
to the police.

5
00:01:39,357 --> 00:01:42,569
That makes it hard
for guys in my line to get...

6
00:01:43,487 --> 00:01:45,363
... ''quality health care. ''

7
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,539
Not many men know
what their life's worth.

8
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:55,957
I do.

9
00:01:56,416 --> 00:02:00,712
Seventy grand.
That's what they took from me.

10
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:04,549
And that's what
I was going to get back.

11
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:32,369
They say, ''Time heals all wounds. ''

12
00:02:33,078 --> 00:02:36,665
You'd think, after five months
of lying on my back...

13
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,001
...I'd give up
any idea of getting even.

14
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,712
Just be a nice guy, call it a day.

15
00:02:45,048 --> 00:02:49,719
Nice guys are fine. You got to have
someone to take advantage of.

16
00:02:49,928 --> 00:02:51,888
But they always finish last.

17
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:00,897
Help a cripple.
Thank you, sir.

18
00:03:01,273 --> 00:03:04,401
Help a Vietnam vet walk again.

19
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:09,156
Help a cripple.
Thank you, sir.

20
00:03:09,364 --> 00:03:12,159
What the fuck you doing?
Get the fuck out!

21
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:14,953
Shut up. I cured you.

22
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:18,498
Cocksucker.

23
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:27,340
-What do I owe you?
-Two ninety-eight.

24
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,403
Son of a--
Hey, my cigarettes!

25
00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:24,147
Sorry, sorry. Pardon me.

26
00:04:59,307 --> 00:05:00,517
Thank you.

27
00:05:05,647 --> 00:05:06,731
One hundred. . .

28
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,191
. . .two hundred. . .

29
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,693
. . .three hundred.

30
00:05:10,026 --> 00:05:12,028
Have a nice day, Mr. Johnson.

31
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:14,739
Excellent fit, sir.

32
00:05:15,031 --> 00:05:16,825
And how will you be paying?

33
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:51,443
I'll give you $900.

34
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:53,236
Let me see that Magnum.

35
00:05:57,699 --> 00:05:58,533
That's it.

36
00:06:22,557 --> 00:06:23,850
$400 and the gun.

37
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,980
I'll need to see I.D.

38
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:30,899
Of course.

39
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:48,208
I'm sorry, Mr. Johnson,
this card's been canceled.

40
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,876
Impossible.

41
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:52,921
Do you have another form
of payment?

42
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:54,631
Try it again.

43
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,537
Old habits die hard, I guess.

44
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:13,043
lf you don 't kick them,
they kick you.

45
00:08:14,252 --> 00:08:16,546
Ain 't marriage grand?

46
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,242
Porter.

47
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,578
You're not dead.

48
00:08:51,456 --> 00:08:53,458
What are you going to do?
Kill me?

49
00:10:01,776 --> 00:10:03,570
Not now.

50
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:08,575
You're cleaning up.

51
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,392
Val still wants to talk to you.

52
00:12:42,604 --> 00:12:44,147
Sorry, babe.

53
00:12:45,857 --> 00:12:48,527
Shall I tell him
to call back again?

54
00:12:49,152 --> 00:12:53,031
No, I'll talk to him.
Shut him up anyway.

55
00:12:58,537 --> 00:13:01,206
Yep, same as always. You?

56
00:13:01,456 --> 00:13:03,124
Yeah, good, good.

57
00:13:04,626 --> 00:13:06,253
Why? Are you there now?

58
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:12,968
Don't sweat it, Val.
We all look alike to them.

59
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:17,848
Same crew. The Chows.
Twice a week.

60
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:22,269
Tuesday and Friday, between 11 and 12.
Always the same route.

61
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,604
Chinese money laundry.

62
00:13:28,525 --> 00:13:29,943
How much in the case?

63
00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:33,530
Anywhere between 340 and half a mill.

64
00:13:38,702 --> 00:13:40,120
How much do you need?

65
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:43,248
We split it 40-40.

66
00:13:43,582 --> 00:13:46,835
I mean, how much do you need
to buy your way back?

67
00:13:51,214 --> 00:13:52,466
Into the syndicate.

68
00:13:53,758 --> 00:13:55,093
How much?

69
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:57,012
-The Outfit?
-Whatever.

70
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,639
Jesus. You know everything.

71
00:14:00,557 --> 00:14:02,142
Hi, sweetie.

72
00:14:03,894 --> 00:14:05,479
1 30 grand.

73
00:14:13,904 --> 00:14:18,450
The Chows won't go to the cops.
They keep everything in-house.

74
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,285
They don't feel pain.

75
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:23,580
You notice anything about those guys?

76
00:14:23,788 --> 00:14:26,833
They Look nasty.
Probably kung fu motherfuckers.

77
00:14:27,042 --> 00:14:30,712
-Did I miss something?
-They weren't wearing seat belts.

78
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:35,091
We'll hit them on Friday.

79
00:14:50,774 --> 00:14:52,776
Hubba, hubba, hubba!

80
00:15:36,945 --> 00:15:38,321
Lookie here.

81
00:15:47,873 --> 00:15:50,167
How's that pileup taste?

82
00:15:53,795 --> 00:15:56,423
Daddy brought home the bacon, baby.

83
00:16:04,055 --> 00:16:04,890
Val!

84
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:06,766
What?

85
00:16:22,324 --> 00:16:26,453
After kicking a Chow's ass,
you want to do it again.

86
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:47,641
1 40 grand.

87
00:16:48,391 --> 00:16:49,601
1 40 apiece.

88
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:51,478
Total.

89
00:16:53,647 --> 00:16:54,648
Total?

90
00:16:58,735 --> 00:17:01,947
That's 70 grand?
That's not enough.

91
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:06,034
Is for me.
I'm taking a few months off.

92
00:17:06,243 --> 00:17:10,705
I'm up short. Sixty short.
Fucking slants!

93
00:17:10,914 --> 00:17:12,833
Should have hit them Tuesday.

94
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,626
Fuck!

95
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:17,087
We got away clean.

96
00:17:18,213 --> 00:17:20,132
And got something to show for it.

97
00:17:20,757 --> 00:17:23,844
Be grateful for what you get,
rule number one.

98
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,850
Yeah, rule number one.

99
00:17:39,276 --> 00:17:40,152
What?

100
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:49,035
Everything's cool.

101
00:17:50,287 --> 00:17:52,581
Just not enough! All right?

102
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:54,457
Never is, Val.

103
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:58,420
Baby, just put the money
in the car, will you?

104
00:18:09,306 --> 00:18:13,226
I can't fucking believe it.
You know what, Porter?

105
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:16,354
This is funny.

106
00:18:16,771 --> 00:18:18,440
This will kill you.

107
00:18:20,817 --> 00:18:22,861
It's always 1 40.

108
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:31,244
Someone ought to give me a Ph.D.

109
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,669
Jesus! Wait till I'm out
of the fucking way!

110
00:18:51,056 --> 00:18:52,974
Everything's cool, baby.

111
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:06,071
You were great.
Everything's cool. Give me--

112
00:19:06,321 --> 00:19:08,240
Okay, keep the gun.

113
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:12,953
That's it. Everything's cool.
It's just like we planned.

114
00:19:13,203 --> 00:19:16,832
Come on.
Don't fall apart on me now.

115
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,334
There we go.

116
00:19:30,095 --> 00:19:33,723
I bet you got a lot of questions
rattling in your head.

117
00:19:39,855 --> 00:19:41,815
Lynn did not understand.

118
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:44,568
I don't know.

119
00:19:44,776 --> 00:19:48,321
Wives get funny
when it comes to girlfriends.

120
00:19:51,241 --> 00:19:52,284
What?

121
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,495
I didn't get that.

122
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,081
You got it.

123
00:20:30,447 --> 00:20:33,742
Come on, Miss Porter.
I don't have all day.

124
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,139
Is Miss Porter here?

125
00:20:57,724 --> 00:20:58,767
Mrs. Porter.

126
00:21:02,854 --> 00:21:03,814
Yeah, whatever.

127
00:21:07,943 --> 00:21:09,528
Motherfucker!

128
00:21:13,281 --> 00:21:15,283
Get up. Turn around.

129
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,035
Come on.

130
00:21:21,498 --> 00:21:23,291
What have we got here?

131
00:21:25,877 --> 00:21:27,462
How much in here?

132
00:21:28,171 --> 00:21:29,172
Two grand.

133
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:31,216
-What's in here?
-Helium.

134
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:33,760
What do you think it is?
It's heroin.

135
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,354
Shit. Oh, shit.

136
00:21:46,731 --> 00:21:48,316
Val Resnick.

137
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:49,985
Where is he?

138
00:21:51,486 --> 00:21:53,530
You want to know where he is?

139
00:21:54,698 --> 00:21:55,532
He's right here.

140
00:21:55,949 --> 00:21:57,617
Look. Fuck you.

141
00:21:58,368 --> 00:21:59,244
Wrong answer.

142
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:04,291
God! You motherfucker!

143
00:22:04,499 --> 00:22:06,960
-Fuck!
-Val Resnick.

144
00:22:08,378 --> 00:22:10,380
I never heard of him, man.

145
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,215
Where'd you get the shit?

146
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:17,429
Come on.
They'll fucking kill me.

147
00:22:21,391 --> 00:22:24,853
What do you think I'll do?
Worry about me.

148
00:22:25,896 --> 00:22:29,149
Oh, come on. Okay, okay.

149
00:22:29,483 --> 00:22:32,152
Stegman, man.
Arthur Stegman.

150
00:22:33,153 --> 00:22:34,613
Where is he?

151
00:22:36,281 --> 00:22:38,241
South End Taxi.

152
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:40,869
Farragut Road, man.

153
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,915
Thanks.

154
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,585
You're welcome.

155
00:23:11,942 --> 00:23:13,652
I'm looking for Arthur Stegman.

156
00:23:15,028 --> 00:23:17,781
He ain't here.
Something I can help you with?

157
00:23:18,323 --> 00:23:20,826
No, you can't. Where is he?

158
00:23:21,535 --> 00:23:22,911
I don't know.

159
00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:27,165
Take a guess.

160
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,459
What?

161
00:23:31,962 --> 00:23:34,256
Take a guess about where he is.

162
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:45,934
Is he at home?

163
00:23:49,771 --> 00:23:51,481
Go fuck yourself.

164
00:23:55,193 --> 00:23:56,194
Here we go.

165
00:23:56,444 --> 00:23:58,572
-This one's mine.
-Roll it.

166
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,740
Wait, that was mine.

167
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:10,333
There's somebody here to see you.

168
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,964

00:24:25,223 --> 00:24:26,475
I'm Porter.

171
00:24:27,517 --> 00:24:31,354
Porter, that looks Like assault to me.

172
00:24:33,982 --> 00:24:37,235
He looks Like he likes
to resist arrest.

173
00:24:41,281 --> 00:24:42,782
Fuck! Not in here.

174
00:24:43,033 --> 00:24:45,160
Jesus! He wants to talk.

175
00:24:45,494 --> 00:24:48,497
Am I right? Did I call it?

176
00:24:51,917 --> 00:24:52,918
Are you Stegman?

177
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:57,464
Maybe. What do you want?

178
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,259
Your boy didn't make his delivery.

179
00:25:05,472 --> 00:25:08,016
Why don't we talk outside?

180
00:25:08,225 --> 00:25:09,351
You're a dealer?

181
00:25:10,685 --> 00:25:13,355
Just forget about it, all right?

182
00:25:13,563 --> 00:25:16,358
Don't touch my money either.
Come on--

183
00:25:16,608 --> 00:25:18,026
This is heroin?

184
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,154
This is heroin.

185
00:25:21,863 --> 00:25:24,449
Don't worry about it.
Take it easy.

186
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,159
Let's talk.

187
00:25:27,577 --> 00:25:30,121
What are you Looking at?
Play your game.

188
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:33,750
And you're bleeding
all over my couch!

189
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,001
Come on!

190
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,926
Steggie's been holding out on us.

191
00:25:44,136 --> 00:25:45,720
I'll check it out.

192
00:25:46,847 --> 00:25:48,557
Val Resnick.

193
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:52,602
-What about him?
-Where is he?

194
00:25:52,853 --> 00:25:55,814
Even if I knew,
the answer would still be no.

195
00:25:56,064 --> 00:25:59,359
-Where'd you meet up with my boy?
-At his drop.

196
00:25:59,568 --> 00:26:00,485
Is he dead?

197
00:26:00,735 --> 00:26:04,406
No, but she is.
O.D.'d on that crap you sent her.

198
00:26:04,698 --> 00:26:07,200
So? What do you care?

199
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,202
I'm her husband.

200
00:26:10,829 --> 00:26:12,789
You won't fucking kill me?

201
00:26:16,126 --> 00:26:17,669
Not in front of these kids.

202
00:26:19,838 --> 00:26:21,298
Where is he?

203
00:26:25,469 --> 00:26:26,511
I don't know!

204
00:26:27,637 --> 00:26:28,805
That's the truth.

205
00:26:29,055 --> 00:26:33,518
It got delivered to me last night.
I won't see anyone till next month.

206
00:26:35,687 --> 00:26:37,355
Why all the trouble?

207
00:26:38,648 --> 00:26:41,109
He's afraid of the girl.
I mean. . .

208
00:26:41,485 --> 00:26:43,820
. . .of Mrs. Porter.

209
00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:47,115
I mean, that's how it Looks to me.

210
00:26:54,748 --> 00:26:56,500
I don't know nothing.

211
00:26:56,833 --> 00:26:58,835
I know Val from the old days.

212
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:01,671
Three months ago he asks me
to do him a favor.

213
00:27:01,922 --> 00:27:05,509
I make an extra grand a month.
I figure, what the hell?

214
00:27:05,717 --> 00:27:10,430
Now you threaten to kill me?
That much a buddy of VaI's I am not.

215
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,683
He's in the city.
That's all I know.

216
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:15,352
How do you know that?

217
00:27:16,478 --> 00:27:18,313
-He said so.
-When?

218
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:22,692
When he came. Said he squared
himself with the syndicate.

219
00:27:22,943 --> 00:27:25,654
Said he was back
in the big time for good.

220
00:27:25,904 --> 00:27:27,280
He was very excited.

221
00:27:27,531 --> 00:27:30,534
You tell him that Porter is back too.

222
00:27:30,826 --> 00:27:33,119
And he wants his money.

223
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:36,790
I'll come back for you
when these kids are not around.

224
00:27:40,001 --> 00:27:41,628
When would I tell him this?

225
00:28:03,316 --> 00:28:04,317
Talk to me.

226
00:28:04,985 --> 00:28:08,530
There's a young lady to see you.
Her name is Pearl.

227
00:28:08,738 --> 00:28:10,782
She's got two very bad habits.

228
00:28:10,991 --> 00:28:14,161
Right now I'm only interested
in one of them.

229
00:28:14,703 --> 00:28:16,413
Send her up.

230
00:28:19,207 --> 00:28:23,086
Apartment 71 8, ma'am.
Go right on up.

231
00:28:42,147 --> 00:28:43,398
Send her up.

232
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:46,860
It's Haskell.
Sorry to call you at home--

233
00:28:47,068 --> 00:28:49,196
Don't be sorry.
Just don't call.

234
00:28:49,404 --> 00:28:53,450
I got a call from a cab guy
on the south end.

235
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,660
-What is it?
-Its this guy, Stegman.

236
00:28:55,911 --> 00:28:58,371
Shit. Hold on a second.

237
00:29:06,421 --> 00:29:10,550
On your knees, bitch.
I want satisfaction.

238
00:29:10,926 --> 00:29:12,928
I'm on the phone, Pearl.

239
00:29:16,681 --> 00:29:18,975
It's ''Mistress Pearl. ''

240
00:29:19,184 --> 00:29:22,312
I'm on the fucking phone!

241
00:29:25,941 --> 00:29:27,234
Make it quick.

242
00:29:27,818 --> 00:29:29,778
This guy Stegman calls.

243
00:29:30,028 --> 00:29:34,407
He sounded all nervous,
like something scared him.

244
00:29:34,616 --> 00:29:38,370
He had to talk to you.
I said I'd see what I could do.

245
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:42,666
-What was it about?
-He said to tell you Lynn was dead.

246
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:48,004
He said some guy wanted you.
That's all he said.

247
00:29:48,255 --> 00:29:49,881
I thought you ought to know.

248
00:29:50,715 --> 00:29:53,260
You did right.
I want to talk to him.

249
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:55,053
Who, Stegman?

250
00:29:55,762 --> 00:29:58,723
No, President Nixon.
Of course, Stegman!

251
00:29:59,015 --> 00:30:01,393
Tell him Varrick's, by the bridge.

252
00:30:01,643 --> 00:30:02,686
Make it. . . .

253
00:30:04,896 --> 00:30:06,731
Make it 20 minutes.

254
00:30:07,983 --> 00:30:09,317
I'm working here!

255
00:30:16,408 --> 00:30:19,452
Can't you see I'm working here?

256
00:30:22,664 --> 00:30:23,957
Put it on my tab.

257
00:30:24,207 --> 00:30:26,126
I'm Looking for a girl.

258
00:30:26,918 --> 00:30:31,131
She goes by the name of Rosie.
Do you know her?

259
00:30:34,009 --> 00:30:36,761
She worked by telephone,
not freelance.

260
00:30:37,429 --> 00:30:39,681
Probably connected
with the syndicate.

261
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:43,018
Out of my League.
I wouldnt know her.

262
00:30:45,395 --> 00:30:47,647
Maybe you know somebody who would.

263
00:30:53,528 --> 00:30:56,406
-Why you Looking for her?
-I'm her brother.

264
00:30:56,656 --> 00:30:59,284
I got cancer.
I want to see her.

265
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:07,417
You two Look close.

266
00:31:10,295 --> 00:31:12,005
Got a cigarette?

267
00:31:17,469 --> 00:31:19,930
Your sister sounds expensive.

268
00:31:20,347 --> 00:31:24,100
Try Michael,
bartender at the Regal Hotel.

269
00:31:24,935 --> 00:31:27,145
That wasn't the name
I was Looking for.

270
00:31:28,563 --> 00:31:30,774
The only one I got.

271
00:31:58,885 --> 00:32:03,056
I tried to call you, but you
must have changed your number.

272
00:32:03,306 --> 00:32:06,226
I never gave you my original number.

273
00:32:07,853 --> 00:32:09,563
What did this guy Look Like?

274
00:32:10,438 --> 00:32:15,569
He had dark hair, blue eyes.
He was a Cro-Magnon-Looking bastard.

275
00:32:15,819 --> 00:32:18,238
If Lynn's dead, he did us a favor.

276
00:32:18,488 --> 00:32:21,366
I know, except I'm out
a grand a month.

277
00:32:21,616 --> 00:32:23,410
We can work something out.

278
00:32:24,202 --> 00:32:25,579
Did you get a name?

279
00:32:26,538 --> 00:32:28,081
He said he was Porter.

280
00:32:32,043 --> 00:32:33,920
He said he was there for Porter?

281
00:32:34,504 --> 00:32:36,548
No, he said he was Porter.

282
00:32:42,554 --> 00:32:45,682
I wouldnt want that guy
after me either.

283
00:32:45,932 --> 00:32:49,561
-I know how you must feel.
-What am I? A nobody?

284
00:32:50,729 --> 00:32:53,773
I've got friends.
All I have to do is point.

285
00:32:54,024 --> 00:32:56,318
I pick up a phone
and he's a dead man.

286
00:32:56,776 --> 00:32:58,361
And he stays dead!

287
00:32:58,945 --> 00:33:01,448
Try to keep it down.
All right?

288
00:33:01,948 --> 00:33:03,492
It's okay.

289
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,452
What'd he say?

290
00:33:06,077 --> 00:33:08,205
He said you owed him money.

291
00:33:08,872 --> 00:33:10,040
Nothing else?

292
00:33:10,415 --> 00:33:12,793
Nothing. Why?
How much you owe him?

293
00:33:13,627 --> 00:33:14,961
None of your business.

294
00:33:16,171 --> 00:33:19,549
I just got the feeling
he'd Like to kill you.

295
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:21,843
Oh, Christ!

296
00:33:22,594 --> 00:33:23,929
Porter.

297
00:33:30,936 --> 00:33:31,853
What'd you tell him?

298
00:33:32,813 --> 00:33:33,647
Nothing!

299
00:33:33,939 --> 00:33:37,484
-What could I tell?
-You tell him about the heroin?

300
00:33:37,984 --> 00:33:40,946
He had it with him!
I told him I delivered it.

301
00:33:41,154 --> 00:33:42,531
Nothing else?

302
00:33:42,781 --> 00:33:44,574
I don't know nothing else!

303
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:49,579
You gave him something. A name.
Someone who knows where to find me.

304
00:33:49,871 --> 00:33:51,998
I swear on my mother--

305
00:33:52,249 --> 00:33:53,416
Fuck your mother!

306
00:33:54,459 --> 00:33:58,380
-That's not nice. Take it easy.
-What are you Looking at?

307
00:33:58,839 --> 00:33:59,798
Val, don't.

308
00:34:00,048 --> 00:34:02,592
Not again. Don't do that, man.

309
00:34:04,136 --> 00:34:05,804
Come on. Not again.

310
00:34:06,096 --> 00:34:07,097
Don't.

311
00:34:07,347 --> 00:34:10,058
-Forget it.
-Is there some trouble here?

312
00:34:10,308 --> 00:34:12,894
We're just Leaving.

313
00:34:13,979 --> 00:34:16,398
You know what?
This one's on me.

314
00:34:16,648 --> 00:34:18,984
You see me reaching for my wallet?

315
00:34:23,113 --> 00:34:27,826
Sorry. He just got a promotion,
so he's a little tense.

316
00:34:29,578 --> 00:34:31,246
Is there a Michael here?

317
00:34:31,455 --> 00:34:33,457
That's him over yonder.

318
00:34:37,461 --> 00:34:40,755
You're the man to see
about horizontal refreshment?

319
00:34:41,006 --> 00:34:43,717
I'm Looking for a girl named Rosie.

320
00:34:43,925 --> 00:34:47,804
Prostitution is illegal
and you're speaking Greek.

321
00:34:51,433 --> 00:34:55,353
Usually these matters are conducted
with more discretion.

322
00:34:59,608 --> 00:35:00,650
Be discreet now.

323
00:35:06,698 --> 00:35:07,532
What was her name?

324
00:35:07,866 --> 00:35:08,742
Rosie.

325
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:11,536
-Who's Looking for her?
-Just call her.

326
00:35:21,463 --> 00:35:22,339
Rosie?

327
00:35:22,756 --> 00:35:24,341
Give me the phone.

328
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:27,969
Take care of that.

329
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,307
Who the hell is this?

330
00:35:32,641 --> 00:35:33,558
Porter.

331
00:35:33,809 --> 00:35:36,436
Try again, honey.
Porter's dead.

332
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:41,358
I used to drive for you.
Provide a safe work environment.

333
00:35:41,733 --> 00:35:42,818
Porter?

334
00:35:56,706 --> 00:35:59,793
Why pour salt on old wounds?

335
00:36:00,627 --> 00:36:02,504
I didn't need to.

336
00:36:05,006 --> 00:36:07,926
I guess I had a soft spot for her.

337
00:36:31,741 --> 00:36:32,701
Come in.

338
00:36:34,453 --> 00:36:36,913
You Look pretty good
for a dead guy.

339
00:36:43,044 --> 00:36:44,838
How'd you hear about it?

340
00:36:45,547 --> 00:36:46,965
People were talking.

341
00:36:47,215 --> 00:36:50,469
Plus I heard your wife
was back in town alone.

342
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,597
She's dead.

343
00:36:54,681 --> 00:36:56,725
I'm sorry, Porter.

344
00:36:57,642 --> 00:36:58,852
Why?

345
00:37:00,103 --> 00:37:04,649
Jesus. Surly Porter.
You're the same as ever, aren't you?

346
00:37:08,195 --> 00:37:10,280
This doesn't Look Like you.

347
00:37:11,573 --> 00:37:13,658
Yeah, well, people change.

348
00:37:14,743 --> 00:37:15,994
Stay.

349
00:37:16,328 --> 00:37:18,830
It's okay.
Come on, sweetheart.

350
00:37:19,831 --> 00:37:22,334
Meet the nastiest dog
who ever lived.

351
00:37:25,504 --> 00:37:26,463
What's his name?

352
00:37:27,506 --> 00:37:28,340
Porter.

353
00:37:29,966 --> 00:37:31,968
He took your job after you Left.

354
00:37:32,177 --> 00:37:35,305
He's just as tough,
but he won't Leave me.

355
00:37:44,272 --> 00:37:45,440
I need a favor.

356
00:37:46,942 --> 00:37:48,318
A favor?

357
00:37:48,735 --> 00:37:51,154
Maybe you're not the same as ever.

358
00:37:54,324 --> 00:37:56,576
I'm Looking for a syndicate boy.

359
00:37:58,328 --> 00:37:59,538
It's the ''Outfit. ''

360
00:37:59,746 --> 00:38:02,582
-We don't say syndicate anymore.
-Whatever.

361
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:05,335
Don't get touchy.
What's his name?

362
00:38:07,712 --> 00:38:09,047
Val Resnick.

363
00:38:12,092 --> 00:38:13,385
That son of a bitch.

364
00:38:15,387 --> 00:38:16,221
You know him?

365
00:38:17,305 --> 00:38:21,393
I met up with him once
a few years ago.

366
00:38:21,768 --> 00:38:25,021
He can't use Star's service.
He beats up the girls.

367
00:38:25,272 --> 00:38:27,023
He almost killed one.

368
00:38:27,858 --> 00:38:28,692
You?

369
00:38:33,363 --> 00:38:36,700
Does it matter?
You quit Looking after me.

370
00:38:42,038 --> 00:38:44,207
Would you know where he might be?

371
00:38:46,877 --> 00:38:48,753
I suppose he's at the hotel.

372
00:38:49,629 --> 00:38:52,674
-Which one?
-The Outfit hotel.

373
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,759
The address?

374
00:38:57,345 --> 00:38:59,347
We're friends, right?

375
00:39:00,056 --> 00:39:03,977
I mean, we used to be.
But I'm an employee too.

376
00:39:04,227 --> 00:39:07,939
The Outfit wouldnt Like me
telling you, would they?

377
00:39:08,607 --> 00:39:09,941
How strong are you?

378
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:14,070
Personally, I think you are
the strongest man I've ever met.

379
00:39:14,321 --> 00:39:16,198
But I wonder if it's enough.

380
00:39:16,907 --> 00:39:18,325
For what?

381
00:39:19,034 --> 00:39:22,037
You want this guy
for something he won't Like.

382
00:39:22,996 --> 00:39:24,206
I'm going to kill him.

383
00:39:27,709 --> 00:39:29,795
That's something he won't Like.

384
00:39:32,214 --> 00:39:36,009
What if they grab you and ask you
how you found out?

385
00:39:36,218 --> 00:39:39,221
You know I wouldnt turn you in.

386
00:39:39,471 --> 00:39:42,349
-I wouldnt talk.
-What if they ask you hard?

387
00:39:44,142 --> 00:39:47,437
I'll say it was
a cab dispatcher named Stegman.

388
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,444
The Oakwood Arms, Union and 1 7th.

389
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:27,310
Hi, Val.

390
00:40:30,063 --> 00:40:32,149
Where's my money?

391
00:40:37,654 --> 00:40:39,197
I took your gun.

392
00:40:39,447 --> 00:40:42,159
It's back here.
You Look Like a pro.

393
00:40:42,367 --> 00:40:45,495
Keep your mouth shut
and you'll walk out of here.

394
00:40:48,999 --> 00:40:51,960
My 70 grand. I want it.

395
00:40:52,961 --> 00:40:55,422
I don't have it right now.

396
00:40:55,881 --> 00:41:00,635
-Where is it?
-I gave all 1 30,000 to the Outfit.

397
00:41:00,886 --> 00:41:02,471
I gave it all to them.

398
00:41:04,556 --> 00:41:08,935
Tell them you gave them money that
doesn't belong to you. Get it back.

399
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:12,606
I can't do that.
You don't know these--

400
00:41:14,316 --> 00:41:16,651
You'll kill me
whether I get it or not.

401
00:41:18,236 --> 00:41:20,530
All right, I'll get the money.

402
00:41:20,739 --> 00:41:23,909
Just give me a few days.
What are you doing?

403
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,078
Noon. Tomorrow.

404
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:28,205
Say it.

405
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:30,332
All right.

406
00:41:30,999 --> 00:41:33,710
This may sound crazy,
but no hard feelings?

407
00:41:34,586 --> 00:41:37,839
I did what I had to do.
You can appreciate that.

408
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,466
I appreciate that, you--

409
00:41:39,758 --> 00:41:41,009
No, no! Don't.

410
00:41:42,969 --> 00:41:44,095
Please.

411
00:41:44,346 --> 00:41:45,847
Allow me.

412
00:41:53,688 --> 00:41:55,065
Jesus!

413
00:42:04,115 --> 00:42:05,742
You bitch!

414
00:42:08,036 --> 00:42:09,079
Let her work.

415
00:42:23,135 --> 00:42:24,553
Me Love you, baby.

416
00:42:26,721 --> 00:42:29,099
Me Love you Long time.

417
00:42:35,564 --> 00:42:37,232
No, no, wait.

418
00:42:43,363 --> 00:42:44,197
Tomorrow.

419
00:42:45,031 --> 00:42:45,991
Noon.

420
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:50,537
You and the money be at
7th and Franklin at the pay phone.

421
00:42:56,418 --> 00:42:57,961
Where'd you get this?

422
00:42:59,421 --> 00:43:01,923
Some hooker had it.
I recognized you.

423
00:43:02,132 --> 00:43:04,634
I swiped it in case I could use it.

424
00:43:04,843 --> 00:43:06,303
Did you hurt her?

425
00:43:07,429 --> 00:43:09,431
The hooker,
did you hurt her?

426
00:43:09,681 --> 00:43:11,516
What does that have to do
with anything?

427
00:43:20,775 --> 00:43:22,777
I've got a few minutes.

428
00:43:23,904 --> 00:43:25,906
So go boil an egg.

429
00:43:32,704 --> 00:43:36,500
Phillip says you have a problem
you need help with.

430
00:43:37,292 --> 00:43:38,376
Yes, sir.

431
00:43:39,211 --> 00:43:40,545
Is it your problem. . .

432
00:43:40,754 --> 00:43:43,799
. . .who breached our security
Last night?

433
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,343
He breaks into my apartment--

434
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:50,388
There's an old expression
that has served me well:

435
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:53,058
''Do not shit where you eat. ''

436
00:43:54,976 --> 00:43:56,561
Or ''Live. ''

437
00:43:56,812 --> 00:43:58,271
''Do not shit where you Live. ''

438
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,856
I Like that better.

439
00:44:00,649 --> 00:44:01,817
I'm sorry, Mr. Carter.

440
00:44:02,025 --> 00:44:04,528
There are three ways
we can handle this.

441
00:44:04,778 --> 00:44:09,366
One: We help you.
Two: We allow you to help yourself.

442
00:44:10,408 --> 00:44:12,828
Three: We have you replaced.

443
00:44:17,999 --> 00:44:23,130
We have an investment in you, Resnick,
of time, money and training.

444
00:44:23,338 --> 00:44:25,340
So assisting you would be. . .

445
00:44:25,674 --> 00:44:28,760
. . .in a way, protecting our investment.

446
00:44:29,302 --> 00:44:32,430
That is good business policy.

447
00:44:32,681 --> 00:44:34,224
Yes, sir, Mr. Carter.

448
00:44:34,432 --> 00:44:36,810
Thank you.
You won't regret it.

449
00:44:40,939 --> 00:44:44,734
According to Phillip,
a man has come to kill you?

450
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:49,573
He's alone and he's
a professional robber. Correct?

451
00:44:49,781 --> 00:44:53,702
Yes, sir. He does payroll jobs,
banks, stuff Like that.

452
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:57,456
-What's his name?
-Porter.

453
00:44:58,248 --> 00:44:59,583
What's his first name?

454
00:45:05,714 --> 00:45:09,718
I don't know. He never called
himself anything but Porter.

455
00:45:21,396 --> 00:45:24,774
Where did you get the $1 30,000?

456
00:45:29,529 --> 00:45:32,282
That's why this man is in town?

457
00:45:32,866 --> 00:45:34,993
The $1 30,000 you paid us back.

458
00:45:35,368 --> 00:45:38,413
Yes, sir.
But only $70,000 of it was his.

459
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:43,710
We never asked you where you got it.
It's none of our business.

460
00:45:43,919 --> 00:45:47,130
Now it appears
it has become our business.

461
00:45:50,467 --> 00:45:52,719
Here's his file, Mr. Carter.

462
00:46:00,101 --> 00:46:04,189
Do you understand your value
to the organization?

463
00:46:06,441 --> 00:46:10,445
You're a sadist, you Lack compunction.
That comes in handy.

464
00:46:11,988 --> 00:46:17,119
But now, an area of your personal Life
has become a danger to us.

465
00:46:19,996 --> 00:46:24,459
A man in our organization needs
to be tough, self-reliant.

466
00:46:25,418 --> 00:46:28,880
Were you to handle this problem
on your own. . .

467
00:46:30,549 --> 00:46:32,968
. . .there would be no doubt. . .

468
00:46:34,219 --> 00:46:36,096
. . .you're the man we want.

469
00:46:36,304 --> 00:46:37,472
I want to.

470
00:46:37,848 --> 00:46:40,225
I want to handle it myself.

471
00:46:40,433 --> 00:46:41,476
Great.

472
00:46:42,227 --> 00:46:46,523
Until it is handed, I want you
to move out of the Oakwood.

473
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:50,735
I don't have a place. . . .

474
00:46:50,986 --> 00:46:53,572
No more unpleasantness at the hotel.

475
00:46:55,574 --> 00:46:56,825
Yes, sir.

476
00:47:06,126 --> 00:47:10,380
It might be easier
if Resnick just disappeared.

477
00:47:12,007 --> 00:47:13,842
I thought about that.

478
00:47:14,426 --> 00:47:16,845
I'm not worried about Resnick.

479
00:47:17,053 --> 00:47:20,182
He wouldnt Last two minutes
without us.

480
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:22,809
It's that other mutt
I'm thinking about.

481
00:47:23,018 --> 00:47:24,603
-What's his name?
-Porter.

482
00:47:26,938 --> 00:47:31,776
Takes a Lot of moxie to walk in
and whack our guys around.

483
00:47:32,694 --> 00:47:34,488
Either that or he's shit nuts.

484
00:47:35,864 --> 00:47:39,034
Frankly, I don't understand it
for $1 30,000.

485
00:47:39,409 --> 00:47:41,411
It was $70,000, his share.

486
00:47:42,662 --> 00:47:44,414
That's even worse.

487
00:47:44,956 --> 00:47:47,834
I don't want
Mr. Bronson hearing about this.

488
00:47:48,293 --> 00:47:50,462
He'll think I'm getting soft.

489
00:47:50,754 --> 00:47:52,547
His principle has always been:

490
00:47:52,756 --> 00:47:55,759
''If you don't understand it,
get rid of it. ''

491
00:47:56,885 --> 00:48:00,138
A stitch in time, so to speak.

492
00:48:01,181 --> 00:48:03,016
Stitch this mutt up, Phil.

493
00:48:08,271 --> 00:48:10,565
Any Polaroids or trophies?

494
00:48:10,816 --> 00:48:12,609
No, not this time.

495
00:48:15,862 --> 00:48:19,324
They cut me Loose, Pearl.
Like I thought they would.

496
00:48:19,658 --> 00:48:21,451
Hold on one second.

497
00:48:21,785 --> 00:48:25,872
Shut up!
I'm on the fucking phone!

498
00:48:36,049 --> 00:48:36,883
Yes?

499
00:48:37,551 --> 00:48:39,970
Did your friends make it to town?

500
00:48:40,762 --> 00:48:42,013
Last night, baby.

501
00:48:42,222 --> 00:48:45,475
Did you tell them
Porter took their payroll?

502
00:48:45,684 --> 00:48:46,852
I did.

503
00:48:47,477 --> 00:48:49,437
And they want retribution.

504
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:52,315
All right. Here's what we do.

505
00:49:54,127 --> 00:49:58,298
Yeah, that's Porter.
He has shit for brains.

506
00:49:58,715 --> 00:49:59,966
Shit.

507
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,035
Shit!

508
00:50:31,331 --> 00:50:32,958
Next time, Porter.

509
00:50:36,962 --> 00:50:39,172
Porter's made some new friends.

510
00:50:59,276 --> 00:51:01,903
-Easy, mister.
-I won't press charges.

511
00:51:02,112 --> 00:51:04,197
-Who were they?
-I don't know.

512
00:51:05,574 --> 00:51:07,033
It's you guys.

513
00:51:07,242 --> 00:51:09,995
Stegman says you got
a Line on a Load of cash.

514
00:51:10,203 --> 00:51:12,622
240 grand, to be exact.

515
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:14,416
Seventy.

516
00:51:16,209 --> 00:51:18,211
Come on, man, get off of me!

517
00:51:18,712 --> 00:51:21,715
What do you take us for?
Idiots?

518
00:51:22,466 --> 00:51:24,593
Nobody'd do this shit for 70 grand.

519
00:51:24,801 --> 00:51:27,596
You Look Like a whole bunch
of trouble to us.

520
00:51:27,804 --> 00:51:29,931
We found a dead girl full of heroin.

521
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:33,727
There were signs of a struggle.
We're not sure it was an O.D.

522
00:51:33,935 --> 00:51:36,563
We got a witness.
A guy with one nostril.

523
00:51:36,771 --> 00:51:38,482
Remember him?

524
00:51:39,107 --> 00:51:41,568
Don't worry.
We'll give you immunity.

525
00:51:41,776 --> 00:51:44,112
Room to operate,
get-out-of-jail-free card.

526
00:51:44,362 --> 00:51:46,656
All you got to do is get the money.

527
00:51:47,532 --> 00:51:49,326
We can't help you, though.

528
00:51:50,076 --> 00:51:52,579
-It would be against the Law.
-Understand?

529
00:51:54,998 --> 00:51:56,792
-It's my money.
-Wrong.

530
00:51:59,461 --> 00:52:00,837
It's our money.

531
00:52:01,046 --> 00:52:04,382
You be a good boy, we give you a piece.

532
00:52:04,591 --> 00:52:06,176
It'll be easy, Porter.

533
00:52:06,843 --> 00:52:08,094
You got it?

534
00:52:08,762 --> 00:52:10,722
-He's got it.
-Understand?

535
00:52:12,015 --> 00:52:13,809
-We'll be in touch.
-Sure.

536
00:52:15,143 --> 00:52:16,561
What a dope!

537
00:52:17,437 --> 00:52:18,396
Fuck.

538
00:52:18,605 --> 00:52:20,565
Crooked cops.

539
00:52:20,857 --> 00:52:23,109
Do they come any other way?

540
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:29,241
If I'd been just a little dumber,
I could've joined the force myself.

541
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:03,567
Jesus Christ,
you need to see a doctor.

542
00:53:04,734 --> 00:53:08,155
-It's going to sting.
-Just clean it up, all right?

543
00:53:08,989 --> 00:53:10,657
You hold it there.

544
00:53:23,587 --> 00:53:25,255
I'll do it.

545
00:53:30,844 --> 00:53:32,971
Tell me something, Porter.

546
00:53:35,265 --> 00:53:39,269
When did you decide to Leave?
That night we slept together?

547
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:41,897
No.

548
00:53:44,191 --> 00:53:46,651
The next day,
when I drove you to work.

549
00:53:52,157 --> 00:53:53,742
You couldve asked me to quit.

550
00:53:58,872 --> 00:54:01,958
You couldve asked me
to drive you somewhere else.

551
00:54:15,889 --> 00:54:18,016
Hubba, hubba, hubba.

552
00:54:26,024 --> 00:54:26,900
Thanks.

553
00:54:28,068 --> 00:54:28,902
Does it fit?

554
00:54:29,778 --> 00:54:31,988
Like it was made for me.

555
00:54:34,449 --> 00:54:36,243
It'll Look great in your casket.

556
00:54:47,712 --> 00:54:49,506
You know what I think?

557
00:54:49,881 --> 00:54:54,261
I think that all those stories
about you being dead were true.

558
00:54:54,469 --> 00:54:57,222
You're too thickheaded to admit it.

559
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:28,211
God, I missed you.

560
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:30,297
I miss you.

561
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,265
Don't, don't, don't. . . .

562
00:55:42,017 --> 00:55:43,894
I can't. I got. . .

563
00:55:46,396 --> 00:55:48,273
. . .stuff to do.

564
00:56:40,492 --> 00:56:42,119
Where is he?

565
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:47,999
Porter. Where is he?

566
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:50,043
He's in the bedroom.

567
00:57:05,433 --> 00:57:07,352
Is he hurt bad?

568
00:57:08,895 --> 00:57:11,231
The doctor should be here any minute.

569
00:57:11,439 --> 00:57:13,608
That's bullshit.

570
00:57:29,291 --> 00:57:31,168
Here I come, pally.

571
00:57:34,045 --> 00:57:34,880
Goddamn!

572
00:57:37,382 --> 00:57:38,717
Goddamn!

573
00:57:46,141 --> 00:57:47,684
Get in here!

574
00:57:54,149 --> 00:57:55,275
Where is he?

575
00:57:55,484 --> 00:57:57,694
He's gone, he's gone.

576
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,821
Gone?

577
00:58:03,241 --> 00:58:06,119
I know you.
You're that whore from the picture.

578
00:58:09,998 --> 00:58:11,708
How do you know him?

579
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:13,877
He used to drive me.

580
00:58:18,673 --> 00:58:21,176
I'm driving you now, honey.

581
00:58:22,469 --> 00:58:24,095
You know what you are?

582
00:58:24,304 --> 00:58:25,764
Educate me.

583
00:58:26,181 --> 00:58:28,266
An ugly pig who beats up women. . .

584
00:58:28,475 --> 00:58:32,479
. . .who can't get it up because
he's terrified of his own shadow!

585
00:58:32,854 --> 00:58:33,814
Is that right?

586
00:58:34,064 --> 00:58:35,315
Is that right?

587
00:58:35,524 --> 00:58:37,859
Then you must be the Lucky girl.

588
00:58:41,154 --> 00:58:44,282
Hubba, hubba, hubba!
I knew I'd seen that ass before.

589
00:58:46,451 --> 00:58:49,162
I am going to fuck you
six ways from Sunday.

590
00:59:18,817 --> 00:59:20,652
I forgot my cigarettes.

591
00:59:31,371 --> 00:59:33,039
All right, Val.

592
00:59:33,915 --> 00:59:38,462
This Outfit, or whatever you call it,
it's got a head man, right?

593
00:59:38,753 --> 00:59:39,588
Who?

594
00:59:40,755 --> 00:59:42,215
They'll kill me.

595
00:59:42,632 --> 00:59:45,552
What do you think I'll do?
Worry about me.

596
00:59:47,429 --> 00:59:48,972
Names. Come on.

597
00:59:49,973 --> 00:59:53,185
Fairfax and Carter.
They run the whole city.

598
00:59:55,145 --> 00:59:56,897
Where do I find them?

599
00:59:57,397 --> 00:59:59,232
Fairfax isn't in town.

600
00:59:59,983 --> 01:00:02,027
What about Carter?
Is he in town?

601
01:00:04,029 --> 01:00:06,573
Porter, it won't do you any good.

602
01:00:06,865 --> 01:00:09,201
They're going to--
Jesus!

603
01:00:10,911 --> 01:00:15,123
Frederick Carter Investments.
1 20 Commerce Avenue.

604
01:00:16,875 --> 01:00:17,709
Thanks.

605
01:00:20,629 --> 01:00:22,005
All right!

606
01:00:22,798 --> 01:00:25,884
All right!
I'll help you out.

607
01:00:27,219 --> 01:00:31,264
You're fucking nuts going up
against the Outfit for 70 grand.

608
01:00:31,473 --> 01:00:33,725
But I'm going to help you out.

609
01:00:34,476 --> 01:00:35,811
Here. Keep talking.

610
01:00:38,688 --> 01:00:40,190
Thanks.

611
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:45,153
I can get you in.
It's tighter than a drum.

612
01:00:45,445 --> 01:00:46,404
How many guys?

613
01:00:47,823 --> 01:00:49,282
It's tighter than hell.

614
01:00:49,491 --> 01:00:53,745
Only one guy on the outside.
So I got a way around that.

615
01:00:56,998 --> 01:00:58,625
You are crazy!

616
01:00:58,834 --> 01:01:00,752
You're a crazy son of a bitch!

617
01:01:01,628 --> 01:01:03,421
That's why I Love you.

618
01:01:04,047 --> 01:01:05,298
You got a Light?

619
01:01:07,175 --> 01:01:08,093
You got a Light?

620
01:01:13,265 --> 01:01:14,516
Then what good are you?

621
01:01:14,808 --> 01:01:16,184
Check my pocket!

622
01:01:44,379 --> 01:01:45,839
Is your name on the Lease?

623
01:01:51,136 --> 01:01:53,555
The Outfit pays for everything.

624
01:01:55,140 --> 01:02:00,145
Gather up everything you need.
Say goodbye to this place.

625
01:02:25,128 --> 01:02:26,379
It's okay.

626
01:02:26,713 --> 01:02:28,298
It's okay, puppy.

627
01:02:28,757 --> 01:02:30,592
He'll Live. How are you?

628
01:02:38,183 --> 01:02:39,643
Yeah, I know.

629
01:02:39,851 --> 01:02:42,479
It's not much, but you'll be safe.

630
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:45,690
Nobody knows I'm here.
Sit down. Relax.

631
01:03:00,872 --> 01:03:01,873
What?

632
01:03:03,583 --> 01:03:05,836
Nobody has this number.

633
01:03:49,546 --> 01:03:52,132
Somebody does know I'm here.

634
01:03:56,761 --> 01:03:58,889
He's probably fucking her.

635
01:03:59,097 --> 01:04:02,976
-He's taking Long enough.
-Maybe the dog too.

636
01:04:03,477 --> 01:04:05,187
You think so?

637
01:04:06,396 --> 01:04:07,981
Give it a minute.

638
01:04:34,966 --> 01:04:38,011
Okay, Lets give him another bell.

639
01:04:46,561 --> 01:04:48,021
Shit.

640
01:04:48,855 --> 01:04:51,149
He's behind us.

641
01:05:24,057 --> 01:05:26,268
Its not just anybody that gets...

642
01:05:26,476 --> 01:05:29,688
...a hit put on him by a firm
like the Outfit.

643
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:32,232
I was moving up in the world.

644
01:05:33,859 --> 01:05:36,611
Maybe it was time
to pay them a visit.

645
01:05:36,862 --> 01:05:39,322
Carter wouldn't be expecting that.

646
01:05:40,031 --> 01:05:43,326
And who knows?
I might even get my money back.

647
01:06:13,732 --> 01:06:15,066
I told you he'd show.

648
01:06:15,275 --> 01:06:17,068
Give me my goddamn money, please.

649
01:06:19,404 --> 01:06:21,823
-Give me my money.
-You sure that's him?

650
01:06:22,032 --> 01:06:23,116
Yeah, come on.

651
01:06:24,868 --> 01:06:26,870
Thank you very much.

652
01:06:28,830 --> 01:06:30,290
What you up to, buddy?

653
01:06:30,499 --> 01:06:32,709
Well, our money's in there.

654
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,420
Still interested?

655
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:38,340
Not in the dough,
but the boat I'll buy with it.

656
01:06:42,177 --> 01:06:44,179
What's he doing here?

657
01:06:44,638 --> 01:06:46,473
It's a ride-along, Porter.

658
01:06:46,723 --> 01:06:49,476
Your piece of the pie
just got smaller.

659
01:06:49,684 --> 01:06:52,270
But don't worry,
I'll Leave you some crust.

660
01:06:54,439 --> 01:06:56,733
What are you waiting for?
Go get it.

661
01:06:57,109 --> 01:06:58,151
Go get our money.

662
01:07:00,737 --> 01:07:01,947
Do me a favor?

663
01:07:02,781 --> 01:07:03,990
We're here to help.

664
01:07:05,117 --> 01:07:08,829
They'll frisk me when I go in.
Would you hold onto this?

665
01:07:11,915 --> 01:07:13,625
Just for a Little while.

666
01:07:15,335 --> 01:07:16,920
Sure, Porter.

667
01:07:22,759 --> 01:07:24,302
Nice balance.

668
01:07:28,265 --> 01:07:29,850
Douche bag.

669
01:07:41,069 --> 01:07:42,779
Can I help you?

670
01:07:43,488 --> 01:07:46,533
-I want to see Mr. Carter.
-And who are you?

671
01:07:46,783 --> 01:07:49,494
I'm the guy that whacked Val Resnick.

672
01:07:49,744 --> 01:07:51,329
I'm sorry, I don't--

673
01:07:52,747 --> 01:07:54,875
Didn't copy. Repeat.

674
01:07:58,503 --> 01:07:59,671
Right.

675
01:08:01,131 --> 01:08:04,092
Mr. Carter will see you.
Turn around.

676
01:08:29,701 --> 01:08:31,661
Bravo. Sit down.

677
01:08:37,709 --> 01:08:40,170
My compliments.
They were two of my best.

678
01:08:40,378 --> 01:08:42,422
They Lull too easy.

679
01:08:52,265 --> 01:08:53,892
You want something from me.

680
01:08:54,810 --> 01:08:58,355
Val Resnick gave you $1 30,000.

681
01:08:58,814 --> 01:09:00,774
He paid us.
It was a debt.

682
01:09:01,233 --> 01:09:03,985
$70,000 of it is mine.
I want it back.

683
01:09:06,029 --> 01:09:09,324
I'm sorry, but I seem to have
misplaced your name.

684
01:09:09,699 --> 01:09:10,617
Porter.

685
01:09:10,826 --> 01:09:11,952
Porter. Right.

686
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:14,746
I won't forget it again.

687
01:09:15,330 --> 01:09:18,083
The Outfit is not unreasonable.

688
01:09:18,542 --> 01:09:22,170
But no corporation would agree
to what you're asking.

689
01:09:22,379 --> 01:09:24,756
Will Fairfax give me my money?

690
01:09:27,342 --> 01:09:31,721
Resnick told you quite a bit.
Fairfax will tell you the same thing.

691
01:09:32,013 --> 01:09:34,766
We're not authorized
to do things Like this.

692
01:09:34,975 --> 01:09:36,685
Who is?
Who makes the decisions?

693
01:09:37,269 --> 01:09:39,521
A committee would, in this case.

694
01:09:39,729 --> 01:09:43,150
You go high enough, you always come
to one man. Who?

695
01:09:55,954 --> 01:09:59,082
Mr. Bronson,
I have Mr. Carter on the line.

696
01:09:59,291 --> 01:10:01,126
Put him through.

697
01:10:01,334 --> 01:10:02,669
Go ahead, sir.

698
01:10:02,878 --> 01:10:04,337
Carter, how's business?

699
01:10:04,546 --> 01:10:07,007
-Good till now.
-You want to see me, Dad?

700
01:10:07,174 --> 01:10:08,967
Hang on, Carter.

701
01:10:09,384 --> 01:10:11,887
Look in that green box, Johnny.

702
01:10:25,317 --> 01:10:27,110
Are you kidding me?

703
01:10:28,487 --> 01:10:30,030
Is it the convertible?

704
01:10:30,238 --> 01:10:31,323
You thought I forgot.

705
01:10:34,367 --> 01:10:35,994
Happy birthday, son.

706
01:10:36,286 --> 01:10:40,415
This car? And Nick's got us ringside
at the fight tonight.

707
01:10:40,624 --> 01:10:41,500
It'll be a good one.

708
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:43,293
My money's on Rankin.

709
01:10:43,502 --> 01:10:45,378
No, Hicks is favored.

710
01:10:46,171 --> 01:10:48,882
-That's got nothing to do with it.
-I got to go.

711
01:10:50,717 --> 01:10:51,968
Thanks.

712
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:53,386
Happy birthday.

713
01:10:54,179 --> 01:10:56,723
-Drive safe.
-You got it.

714
01:10:57,599 --> 01:10:59,017
Sorry. What is it?

715
01:11:00,227 --> 01:11:04,397
I have a problem. There's a man
in my office with a gun. . .

716
01:11:04,856 --> 01:11:07,651
... who says he'll kill me
if we don 't pay him...

717
01:11:07,859 --> 01:11:11,363
. . . $1 30,000 that one of our guys
stole from him.

718
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:15,659
Its 70. How much is
this guy Carter worth to you?

719
01:11:15,867 --> 01:11:16,910
What do you mean?

720
01:11:17,244 --> 01:11:19,496
Either I get my money
or I'll kill Carter.

721
01:11:19,955 --> 01:11:21,623
Are you threatening me?

722
01:11:21,832 --> 01:11:24,751
I'm not threatening you.
I'm threatening Carter.

723
01:11:25,961 --> 01:11:28,797
An audacious man. Who are you?

724
01:11:31,341 --> 01:11:33,009
My money, yes or no?

725
01:11:33,927 --> 01:11:34,761
No.

726
01:11:39,599 --> 01:11:40,517
Carter?

727
01:11:47,899 --> 01:11:49,901
What's going on there?

728
01:11:50,193 --> 01:11:54,489
You just don't get it,
do you, you dumbfuck?

729
01:11:54,698 --> 01:11:56,783
Carter, talk to me.

730
01:12:00,078 --> 01:12:03,081
Call Fairfax and tell him
I croaked Carter.

731
01:12:03,290 --> 01:12:06,626
And he's next. After that,
I'm coming to get you.

732
01:12:07,377 --> 01:12:09,504
Are you out of your mind?

733
01:12:10,046 --> 01:12:12,757
You just dug your own grave.

734
01:12:20,307 --> 01:12:23,059
-I don't see any cash.
-They write you a check?

735
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:26,104
I have to go and see another guy.

736
01:12:26,354 --> 01:12:27,355
Last one.

737
01:12:27,564 --> 01:12:31,568
Then we got a dead woman and assault
to talk to you about.

738
01:12:31,818 --> 01:12:35,280
That means more paperwork.
And we don't Like paperwork.

739
01:12:35,655 --> 01:12:37,324
Damn shame, Porter.

740
01:12:37,532 --> 01:12:40,243
But don't let the bastards
get you down.

741
01:12:41,286 --> 01:12:43,955
That's right. Don't give up.

742
01:12:46,917 --> 01:12:48,251
Can I have my piece?

743
01:12:58,386 --> 01:12:59,554
Nice roscoe.

744
01:13:00,639 --> 01:13:02,390
Heavy enough to be a nutcracker.

745
01:13:02,599 --> 01:13:04,976
We'll be in touch, Rocky.

746
01:13:06,645 --> 01:13:08,939
Keep up the good work.

747
01:13:10,524 --> 01:13:14,945
Nobody likes a monkey on their back.
I had three.

748
01:13:15,403 --> 01:13:17,906
And they were cramping my style.

749
01:13:18,115 --> 01:13:20,742
I was going to
have to lighten the load.

750
01:13:58,905 --> 01:13:59,948
Where have you been?

751
01:14:00,115 --> 01:14:03,368
I was taking care of business.
Evening up the odds.

752
01:14:04,995 --> 01:14:08,039
They won't stop until they kill us,
will they?

753
01:14:10,667 --> 01:14:11,710
No.

754
01:14:17,299 --> 01:14:19,009
I'm sorry.

755
01:14:19,926 --> 01:14:21,720
I'm sorry I got you involved.

756
01:14:24,556 --> 01:14:27,017
So why did you?

757
01:14:28,977 --> 01:14:32,606
You're a clever guy.
You didn't need me.

758
01:14:35,025 --> 01:14:36,735
So why did you?

759
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:40,906
Yeah, you're right.

760
01:14:43,074 --> 01:14:47,454
When I came back,
I came back here with nothing.

761
01:14:50,248 --> 01:14:52,375
No Life. No hope.

762
01:14:54,377 --> 01:14:57,464
You were the only good thing
that hadn't been taken.

763
01:15:01,176 --> 01:15:03,136
I couldnt stay away.

764
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:08,433
I had to see you to make sure
I wasn't in hell.

765
01:15:11,061 --> 01:15:13,063
So why don't we get out of here?

766
01:15:14,189 --> 01:15:15,816
-We can't.
-Why?

767
01:15:16,024 --> 01:15:19,111
They won't stop until they bury us.

768
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,073
So?

769
01:15:23,615 --> 01:15:26,201
So we bury them first.

770
01:16:11,913 --> 01:16:13,748
I should have quit.

771
01:16:21,214 --> 01:16:23,383
I should have driven you
somewhere else.

772
01:17:14,643 --> 01:17:16,061
That's me!

773
01:17:31,493 --> 01:17:33,995
Happy birthday, Johnny.

774
01:17:39,292 --> 01:17:41,753
-You are the man!
-This is your night.

775
01:17:50,137 --> 01:17:52,097
I'm your birthday present.

776
01:17:53,223 --> 01:17:55,934
-Who's that?
-You sons of bitches!

777
01:17:56,143 --> 01:17:58,311
We didn't do it.

778
01:17:59,104 --> 01:18:00,564
Dude, she's so hot.

779
01:18:00,772 --> 01:18:03,900
Oh, man, she's so fine.
You're all over it. Go!

780
01:18:04,109 --> 01:18:06,778
Look at this guy!
Dad's really hooking him up.

781
01:18:06,987 --> 01:18:10,073
Boy, you are cute, aren't you?

782
01:18:11,366 --> 01:18:15,287
You must have some pretty
wonderful friends, Johnny.

783
01:18:15,829 --> 01:18:18,623
Wealthy too, because I'm not cheap.

784
01:18:23,086 --> 01:18:25,130
Don't wait up, boys.

785
01:18:25,881 --> 01:18:28,842
I promise he won't be home
before midnight.

786
01:18:32,053 --> 01:18:32,888
See you!

787
01:18:34,931 --> 01:18:36,016
Damn!

788
01:18:49,112 --> 01:18:50,113
That's a good boy.

789
01:18:52,574 --> 01:18:54,534
Yeah, right there.

790
01:19:06,379 --> 01:19:07,881
Relax.

791
01:19:08,548 --> 01:19:11,176
Who's the professional here?

792
01:19:11,593 --> 01:19:13,762
So go with it.

793
01:19:13,970 --> 01:19:16,973
I promise you won't regret it.

794
01:19:17,724 --> 01:19:19,518
There, baby.

795
01:19:35,033 --> 01:19:38,370
Relax, kid.
No one will get hurt.

796
01:19:41,039 --> 01:19:44,251
Get hurt?
What's he talking about?

797
01:20:00,142 --> 01:20:02,394
Glad to have you back, Mr. Fairfax.

798
01:20:02,602 --> 01:20:07,023
I wish I was glad. I was swimming
with dolphins this morning.

799
01:20:08,608 --> 01:20:12,362
Easy! It's genuine alligator.
What's the matter with you?

800
01:20:12,571 --> 01:20:14,573
Sorry, Mr. Fairfax.

801
01:20:16,575 --> 01:20:18,535
How's it going, Charlie?

802
01:20:20,287 --> 01:20:24,583
Porter and Fairfax.
That'll be a short conversation.

803
01:20:29,212 --> 01:20:33,758
Between us and our neighborhood cops,
I'd say we got him well covered.

804
01:20:36,094 --> 01:20:37,137
Walter, wake up.

805
01:20:41,516 --> 01:20:42,684
Wake up!

806
01:20:43,769 --> 01:20:45,854
Keep those bags up, boys.

807
01:20:46,104 --> 01:20:47,230
Come on.

808
01:20:48,148 --> 01:20:49,149
Who are you?

809
01:20:50,650 --> 01:20:53,111
I'm the reason you're home early.

810
01:20:54,946 --> 01:20:55,906
You're Porter?

811
01:20:56,448 --> 01:20:59,701
That's it. Keep them up
or I'll drill you.

812
01:21:04,498 --> 01:21:07,501
What will you have me do?
Stand on my head?

813
01:21:10,545 --> 01:21:14,090
I want you to do me a favor.
Call Mr. Bronson.

814
01:21:14,299 --> 01:21:16,927
See what we can do
about getting my money back.

815
01:21:18,845 --> 01:21:20,889
He Let Carter die.

816
01:21:21,890 --> 01:21:24,726
That poor bastard's
better off dead anyway.

817
01:21:26,061 --> 01:21:27,979
He'd probably Let me die too.

818
01:21:28,188 --> 01:21:30,649
With Carter,
he thought I was bluffing.

819
01:21:31,733 --> 01:21:35,362
Try him. He might be more
receptive than you think.

820
01:21:37,531 --> 01:21:38,865
All right.

821
01:21:40,158 --> 01:21:41,535
You two are fired.

822
01:21:46,748 --> 01:21:48,208
Well, it's Like this.

823
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:51,795
I'm in my Living room.
There's a man named Porter. . .

824
01:21:52,003 --> 01:21:55,048
. . .who says that
he expects you to pay him.

825
01:21:57,634 --> 01:21:59,302
Of course.

826
01:21:59,511 --> 01:22:01,179
He wants to talk to you.

827
01:22:01,388 --> 01:22:02,764
Put on the speaker.

828
01:22:07,811 --> 01:22:10,730
-This is Porter.
-You got balls, Porter.

829
01:22:11,189 --> 01:22:14,443
You've proven to be a pain
in the ass. A mosquito.

830
01:22:15,402 --> 01:22:17,946
To get rid of you,
I'll swat you with 1 30 grand.

831
01:22:19,656 --> 01:22:21,074
It's not a hund--

832
01:22:23,827 --> 01:22:26,413
-What the hell are you doing?
-Fairfax?

833
01:22:26,621 --> 01:22:29,958
It's all right. He's just
killing my alligator bags. . .

834
01:22:30,208 --> 01:22:32,794
. . .and shooting holes in my suits.

835
01:22:33,378 --> 01:22:35,046
That's mean, man!

836
01:22:35,297 --> 01:22:37,716
You aren't Listening.
It's not 1 30--

837
01:22:37,924 --> 01:22:38,800
No, you listen.

838
01:22:39,134 --> 01:22:42,596
You'll get your money,
but you'll never Live to enjoy it.

839
01:22:42,804 --> 01:22:44,723
You let me worry about that.

840
01:22:44,931 --> 01:22:47,768
I want you to deliver
the money yourself.

841
01:22:49,186 --> 01:22:51,021
You're one hell of an optimist.

842
01:22:51,229 --> 01:22:54,232
What makes you think
I'll deliver it myself?

843
01:22:54,816 --> 01:22:57,360
If you don't,
you'll never see Johnny again.

844
01:22:59,070 --> 01:23:00,739
He didn't come home last night.

845
01:23:01,406 --> 01:23:04,534
He's good-looking,
but you indulge him too much.

846
01:23:04,743 --> 01:23:06,328
I told him so.

847
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,664
Bullshit. You haven't got him.

848
01:23:10,207 --> 01:23:13,794
-You're not that stupid.
-My dad never bought me a Ferrari.

849
01:23:14,002 --> 01:23:16,296
I had to steal my first one.

850
01:23:16,546 --> 01:23:19,174
Nice inscription on the key chain.

851
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:21,092
A Little sappy.
Want me to read it?

852
01:23:22,219 --> 01:23:25,597
You're dead.
Nobody fucks with my family.

853
01:23:25,847 --> 01:23:26,681
You hear me?

854
01:23:27,808 --> 01:23:29,184
You're a dead man.

855
01:23:29,434 --> 01:23:33,230
That's Johnny, unless you
turn up with the money.

856
01:23:34,898 --> 01:23:36,399
Is that a yes?

857
01:23:37,692 --> 01:23:39,402
What? Cat got your crotch?

858
01:23:41,238 --> 01:23:43,824
Some decisions are hard.

859
01:23:44,032 --> 01:23:44,908
Where?

860
01:23:46,326 --> 01:23:47,202
I'll Let you know.

861
01:23:47,619 --> 01:23:49,704
I'll be in touch.

862
01:23:55,961 --> 01:23:58,922
You just signed your
death warrant for $1 30,000.

863
01:23:59,214 --> 01:24:01,424
I don't get that. What is it?

864
01:24:02,342 --> 01:24:03,844
The principle?

865
01:24:05,387 --> 01:24:09,182
Stop it, I'm getting misty.
And tell him it's 70.

866
01:24:11,017 --> 01:24:13,937
Seventy?
What do you mean, it's only 70?

867
01:24:14,187 --> 01:24:15,981
Only 70,000?

868
01:24:16,565 --> 01:24:18,900
My suits are worth more than that!

869
01:24:22,737 --> 01:24:26,616
Listen to this:
''Ocean Ray Sundancer.

870
01:24:27,242 --> 01:24:30,454
Icemaker. Camper canvas.

871
01:24:30,871 --> 01:24:35,333
Vacuum-flush head.
Eighty thousand bucks. ''

872
01:24:37,335 --> 01:24:39,129
He ain't going to have it.

873
01:24:39,379 --> 01:24:40,464
You want to bet?

874
01:24:40,714 --> 01:24:44,926
No, I don't want to bet.
I'm out 1 40 already.

875
01:24:46,094 --> 01:24:48,763
1 40 ain't getting my damn boat.

876
01:24:49,014 --> 01:24:51,433
He better come down with something.

877
01:24:52,642 --> 01:24:54,186
Hicks. Leary.

878
01:24:54,478 --> 01:24:58,273
We're Holland and Van Owen.
Internal Affairs.

879
01:25:01,276 --> 01:25:03,361
Back off.
We're on a stakeout.

880
01:25:04,446 --> 01:25:06,198
Step out of the car.

881
01:25:06,823 --> 01:25:07,657
What for?

882
01:25:07,908 --> 01:25:10,118
Step out of the car, detectives.

883
01:25:23,715 --> 01:25:25,342
What the hell's going on?

884
01:25:26,134 --> 01:25:27,010
I don't know.

885
01:25:27,803 --> 01:25:29,095
Is this your badge?

886
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:32,099
The one you reported missing?

887
01:25:34,059 --> 01:25:35,143
Where'd you find it?

888
01:25:35,519 --> 01:25:36,978
Where did you Lose it?

889
01:25:41,775 --> 01:25:42,984
Does this belong to you?

890
01:25:49,282 --> 01:25:50,617
It's Porter. Follow him.

891
01:25:51,493 --> 01:25:52,828
I got that motherfucker.

892
01:26:14,433 --> 01:26:15,600
Get in.

893
01:26:22,649 --> 01:26:23,525
Close the door.

894
01:26:28,363 --> 01:26:30,073
Set the roscoe on the floor.

895
01:26:32,492 --> 01:26:33,326
Slow!

896
01:26:38,373 --> 01:26:41,793
I'm going to turn you in
to the Outfit for a reward.

897
01:26:42,461 --> 01:26:47,007
Maybe they'll ask me to join,
and I'll be on easy street.

898
01:26:47,424 --> 01:26:49,634
Medical. Dental.

899
01:26:50,594 --> 01:26:52,762
I'm going to walk you right in.

900
01:26:53,305 --> 01:26:55,724
Porter on the hoof.

901
01:26:56,767 --> 01:27:00,604
Unless you get rambunctious.
Then I'll take care of you--

902
01:27:05,108 --> 01:27:06,443
Are you going to kill me?

903
01:27:15,118 --> 01:27:16,578
Let him go!

904
01:27:18,079 --> 01:27:18,914
Now.

905
01:27:25,003 --> 01:27:26,505
Hubba, hubba, hubba.

906
01:28:56,761 --> 01:28:58,889
Who are you?
What are you doing?

907
01:28:59,139 --> 01:28:59,973
Fat boy!

908
01:29:01,308 --> 01:29:03,101
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

909
01:29:32,214 --> 01:29:34,674
Stop it. Stop it.

910
01:29:35,133 --> 01:29:36,802
I hate this. I hate it!

911
01:29:41,056 --> 01:29:44,142
Look at this stinking place!
What's with you?

912
01:29:46,186 --> 01:29:48,814
Tell us where he is
so we can get out of here.

913
01:29:49,272 --> 01:29:50,440
Come on.

914
01:30:00,075 --> 01:30:01,201
Too Late now.

915
01:30:05,372 --> 01:30:07,582
He doesn't want to say anything.

916
01:30:07,958 --> 01:30:11,128
He just wants to get beat up,
that's all.

917
01:30:16,091 --> 01:30:17,551
Here it is.

918
01:30:17,759 --> 01:30:19,469
1 30,000.

919
01:30:23,432 --> 01:30:25,851
That's as close as
you'll ever get to it.

920
01:30:26,226 --> 01:30:27,853
I'll make you a deal.

921
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:31,648
Tell me where John is,
and I'll finish you quick.

922
01:30:31,857 --> 01:30:35,485
You won't have to find out
what your Left ball tastes Like.

923
01:30:39,281 --> 01:30:43,994
But if there's even a bruise on him,
I'll make this Last three weeks.

924
01:30:44,703 --> 01:30:48,665
I'll give you a blood transfusion
to keep you alive.

925
01:30:52,919 --> 01:30:53,962
Where is he?

926
01:31:26,161 --> 01:31:27,287
I'm waiting.

927
01:31:32,459 --> 01:31:34,294
This piggy went to the market.

928
01:31:48,892 --> 01:31:49,851
I'm Listening.

929
01:32:01,488 --> 01:32:02,781
This piggy stayed home.

930
01:32:08,203 --> 01:32:10,288
It's Looking Like roast beef.

931
01:32:13,834 --> 01:32:15,418
Eight to go.

932
01:32:16,044 --> 01:32:17,587
Then it's your knees.

933
01:32:18,004 --> 01:32:20,465
You can guess where we go from there.

934
01:32:21,424 --> 01:32:22,259
Where is he?

935
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:36,273
Twenty-four. . . .

936
01:32:37,357 --> 01:32:39,025
Twenty-four Fielding.

937
01:32:40,652 --> 01:32:41,820
Apartment 11.

938
01:32:45,532 --> 01:32:48,160
You'll understand
if I don't trust you.

939
01:32:51,079 --> 01:32:54,249
Put him in the trunk.
We'll take him along.

940
01:32:55,417 --> 01:32:56,877
Let's go, tough guy.

941
01:33:24,738 --> 01:33:26,740
You two watch the front.

942
01:33:39,252 --> 01:33:41,213
Fuck! Come on, Porter.

943
01:33:48,845 --> 01:33:50,430
Hey, give me a Light.

944
01:35:11,094 --> 01:35:15,098
-What the hell's going on?
-You're right not to trust me.

945
01:35:40,999 --> 01:35:42,542
Help me.

946
01:35:44,878 --> 01:35:46,213
Get out!

947
01:36:28,046 --> 01:36:31,299
Come on, Porter.
It's been fun. See you Later.

948
01:36:31,675 --> 01:36:32,509
Get back here!

949
01:36:32,843 --> 01:36:34,261
You bitch!

950
01:36:35,053 --> 01:36:36,596
Come on, Porter.
Let's go.

951
01:36:37,097 --> 01:36:39,015
What took you so Long?

952
01:36:41,268 --> 01:36:42,602
Come on, Porter.

953
01:36:45,772 --> 01:36:46,606
Get in.

954
01:36:47,441 --> 01:36:48,859
Good boy.

955
01:36:52,529 --> 01:36:53,697
What happened?

956
01:36:54,948 --> 01:36:56,116
I got hammered.

957
01:36:57,159 --> 01:36:57,993
You okay?

958
01:37:09,296 --> 01:37:10,172
You got it.

959
01:37:10,755 --> 01:37:12,507
Piece of cake.

960
01:37:17,179 --> 01:37:18,013
Where to?

961
01:37:20,474 --> 01:37:22,768
Just drive, baby.

962
01:37:26,938 --> 01:37:29,483
We were going for breakfast...

963
01:37:29,983 --> 01:37:31,985
...in Canada.

964
01:37:33,069 --> 01:37:34,946
We made a deal:

965
01:37:35,155 --> 01:37:37,240
lf she'd stop hooking...

966
01:37:37,491 --> 01:37:39,910
...I'd stop shooting people.

967
01:37:41,953 --> 01:37:44,289
Maybe we were aiming high.

968
01:41:29,848 --> 01:41:31,892
He's been done bad by, so of course. . .
