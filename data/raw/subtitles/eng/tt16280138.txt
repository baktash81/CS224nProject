00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,000
<i>The impulse to dance
existed long before</i>

2
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,520
<i>our primate ancestors
evolved into humans.</i>

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,440
<i>Evolutionary biologists suggest
that dance was used by early humans</i>

4
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,600
<i>to promote the social cooperation
essential for our survival.</i>

5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,120
<i>Indeed, studies have found that
today's best dancers all share</i>

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,240
<i>the two specific genes associated
with excellent interpersonal skills.</i>

7
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,160
<i>But despite its power
to save our species</i>

8
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,440
<i>dance could not save
a small furniture company in Miami</i>

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,800
<i>from the economic tsunami
of a global pandemic</i>

10
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,840
<i>so like many 40-year-old
Millennial white males</i>

11
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,640
<i>Mike Lane found himself
alone and adrift</i>

12
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,200
<i>in an ocean of failed relationships
and unrealized dreams.</i>

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,000
Excuse me? Hello!

14
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,840
This area is off-limits.

15
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,800
Oh. Well, then you really
shouldn't be here then, should you?

16
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,200
Cute.

17
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,800
Get dressed, start unloading.
Trucks just pulled in.

18
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,880
All right.

19
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,920
So, is she living in Miami now, or...

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,080
Well, she can't go back to London,
Roger's there.

21
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,120
She has to go back, for the daughter.

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,840
Roger still wants it to work,
according to Bob.

23
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,240
She should have just canceled instead
of walking around like a zombie.

24
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,320
Totally.

25
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,200
And here she is.

26
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,480
Hi.

27
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,920
Thank you so much.
This is absolutely beautiful.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,400
- Thank you for your contribution.
- You look stunning.

29
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,760
Scotch, please.

30
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,840
Neat or rocks?

31
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,960
Neat.

32
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,560
You getting what you want?

33
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,120
With the fundraiser.
It looks like it's going all right.

34
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,840
Nobody here knows
what the Big Blue Rescue Project is

35
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,680
and yet they give me
their money every year.

36
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,720
Well, I just think people like
to look at what they can't have.

37
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,000
I guess.

38
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,800
What's up, bro? Two vodka sodas.

39
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,920
Two vodka sodas.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,400
- So, what do you think? Yeah?
- Yeah. Sounds good.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,040
Wait. I know you.
You went to State, right?

42
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,320
State? No, definitely not.

43
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,800
We've definitely met.

44
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,160
No. I don't know. Sorry.

45
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,680
Don't freak the guy out, hon.

46
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,360
I'm not.

47
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,920
Holy shit. I got it.

48
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,760
You really don't remember?

49
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,680
I don't know. Was it at my store?

50
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
No.

51
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,120
You were a cop, right?

52
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,640
- What's your name?
- Kim.

53
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,400
Yeah. Like way back in the day. Yeah.

54
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,320
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Right, right, right.

55
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,440
- Got it.
- Nice pull, hon!

56
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,200
Did you arrest her?

57
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,800
No, I think I let you off
with a warning. Right?

58
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,480
It was my pledge party.
I was being very disorderly.

59
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,400
You being good now? You behaving?

60
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,120
- Yes, I'm great, actually.
- Good.

61
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,800
I'm on Maxandra's legal team
so here to support.

62
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,816
That's cool. What kind of law
do you practice?

63
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,000
Family Law generally.
But, I do specialize in divorce.

64
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,696
Well, it was good to see you.

65
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,320
- See you in another ten years.
- Cheers.

66
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,280
Be good.

67
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,600
I'll do my best.

68
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,520
You! Bartender.

69
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,640
Mrs. Rattigan would like a word.

70
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,760
We're not done breaking down.

71
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,601
Did you hear what I said?
She'd like to see you right now.

72
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,200
Bullshit.

73
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,600
Hey, look, you don't
have to explain it to me.

74
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,680
All right?

75
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,320
Explain it to Zadie.

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Ma'am?

77
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,680
Of course, I'm super uncomfortable
doing that and I won't do it.

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,880
Because that's a date
with chaperones.

79
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,400
I'm not stupid, Roger.

80
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,320
Ma'am, they said to come see you.
Should I just wait outside?

81
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,240
I don't want to see you! All right?

82
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,640
Get it into your head,
if you need to talk to me

83
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,200
then bring the lawyers.

84
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,216
- Bartender?
- I'm sorry. They said

85
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,800
- to come see you. I didn't mean...
- Yes, yes, please come back.

86
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,920
Okay.

87
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,560
Yeah?

88
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,480
You know...

89
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,720
Do you like bartending?

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,120
Sure. It's not really what I do,
but yeah.

91
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,640
- Why not?
- So, what is it that you really do?

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,680
Yeah... Well, it's...
That's a long story.

93
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,480
Did you want me for something?

94
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,360
Yeah.

95
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,520
What's your name?

96
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
Mike.

97
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,640
Nice to meet you, Mike.

98
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,760
Nice to meet you.

99
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,720
How much?

100
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,680
How much for what?

101
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,600
You know. Please
don't make me spit it out

102
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,720
'cause this is the first time
I do this and it's not comfortable.

103
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,120
Look, I don't know
what you're talking about. What?

104
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,720
But Kim told me that
she knew you, and run into you

105
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,880
and that you were a dancer.

106
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,400
- Oh, Kim... Kim told you that?
- Yeah.

107
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,560
Right.

108
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,400
Look, I don't really
do that anymore, so...

109
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,360
What was your name?

110
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,600
- Max.
- Max, it was nice to meet you.

111
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,280
Thanks for...

112
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,880
I'm s... I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.

113
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,136
No, you didn't offend me.
Don't worry.

114
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,216
- It's all...
- Really, I have no idea

115
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,640
what I'm doing. It's just
I'm not normally like this.

116
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,776
- No.
- It's just that I've had

117
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,216
like the shittiest day
and the shittiest week

118
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,240
and the shittiest month

119
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,696
- and the shittiest year.
- Same here.

120
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,880
Welcome to the club.

121
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,320
Don't worry, you didn't offend me.

122
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
Okay.

123
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,120
It was nice to meet you.

124
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,160
So, let's say...

125
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,400
if you were to do this
just, like, one last time.

126
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
How much would
something like that go for?

127
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,680
How much would something
like that go for?

128
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,920
$60,000? Maybe.

129
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,480
- $60,000?
- Yeah. Yeah, 60.

130
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,440
- Let's call it 60.
- What the fuck do you do?

131
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,000
She said it was a silly dance.

132
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,480
Who said that?

133
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,280
Kim? Kim said that? It was silly?

134
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,680
Yeah. She said it was a silly dance

135
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,120
but that it would
get my mind off of things.

136
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,760
And if she's right,
I'm willing to pay six.

137
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,600
What? You're serious right now?

138
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,640
You're gonna pay me $6,000
to give you a dance?

139
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,640
Yeah, but no happy endings, huh?

140
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,320
So we have a deal?

141
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,920
Are you leaving?

142
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,240
You know I have security.

143
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,120
What are you doing?

144
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,200
You seem like you need a drink.

145
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,320
I really, really do.

146
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,120
Why are you moving my flowers?

147
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,440
These will work better here.

148
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,400
You have a really,
really, really nice house.

149
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,160
- Thank you.
- Everything's made really well.

150
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,200
Are you redecorating?

151
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,280
Maybe. Do you have music?

152
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,760
You might want to finish your drink.

153
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,240
So, I don't know if
you really know what you bought

154
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,560
but I'm gonna give it
to you anyway.

155
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,120
And at any point I take you
past your comfort zone...

156
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,560
I fucking slap you.

157
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,960
You can slap me.

158
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,920
That's perfect.

159
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,240
May I touch you?

160
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
I guess.

161
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,200
(Spanish)

162
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,760
You don't know what I said.

163
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,680
What are you talking about?
Yeah, I do.

164
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,560
What did I say?

165
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,920
You said I move like water.

166
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,480
I didn't mean for you
to understand that.

167
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,760
Well, maybe you should be
a little more careful what you say.

168
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,480
Remember, I am from Florida.

169
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,560
If I had known what this night
was going to be like...

170
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,120
I would have gladly paid you
the 60,000.

171
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,776
It wouldn't have mattered anyway,
I'm not gonna take your money.

172
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,360
I'm not even gonna take
the six grand.

173
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,800
Who are you?

174
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,520
I don't know.

175
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,600
What do you mean?

176
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,880
Come with me to London.

177
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,240
What's in London?

178
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,480
My life.

179
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,840
Your life's in London?
I thought this was your house.

180
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,680
This is a house,
but it's not the house.

181
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,160
Max, I can't just go to London.

182
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,240
I got, like, stuff here. I got...

183
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,840
Like there's a whole mess.
I got a job.

184
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
I can't just go to London.

185
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,560
I'm gonna get you
a much better job in London.

186
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,640
You're gonna get...

187
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,920
No, well, I have a job for you
in mind. It's creative.

188
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,360
And all you have to do
is come with me for a month

189
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,760
and I will give you your 60,000.

190
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,000
Max, I can't just up and leave

191
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,496
- my entire life here for you...
- Yes, you can. Yes, you can.

192
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,616
- Listen. Listen.
- Not for a mon... I can't.

193
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,376
- Not for a whole month.
- You should come with me

194
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,560
and then if it's out of
your comfort zone then you just...

195
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,800
- I get to fucking slap you?
- You can fucking slap me.

196
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,200
Let's go.

197
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,240
Thank you.

198
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,400
What are you doing?

199
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,000
I don't really fuck with vegetables.

200
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,760
How do you have that body then?

201
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,360
I don't know. Genetics. Mom and Pops.

202
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,840
How'd you get so rich?

203
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,200
Genetics, I guess.

204
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,920
Yeah?

205
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,560
No, Roger's family is in media.

206
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,800
Oh, that's cool.
Is that like TV and shit?

207
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,280
It's more like everything and shit.

208
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,360
Right.

209
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,560
So... I don't know.
What happened, with that?

210
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,760
Marriage happened.

211
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,800
Are you married?

212
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,720
Am I married?

213
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,000
Would it be a problem if I was?

214
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,000
No. This is 100% business.

215
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,840
Right. You keep talking
about this "job."

216
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,000
But you always leave out
what the actual job is.

217
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,720
It's what you were meant
to be doing all along.

218
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,280
Okay. I've made it
really clear though

219
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,920
I'm not... I don't dance anymore.

220
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,120
Then I can claim that I got
Magic Mike's Last Dance.

221
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,200
So what else could you
possibly be paying me for?

222
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,960
We are not having sex.

223
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,960
Completely out of the question.

224
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,960
- Why?
- You know, Mike

225
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,800
I actually think you have...

226
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,920
other talents. And this is
what I'm invested in.

227
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,200
Okay. But just, you know,
hear me out.

228
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,480
You've purchased me
for a month, let's just say...

229
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,160
you say, "Jump." I say, "Which bed?"

230
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,640
Look, last night was...

231
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,120
kind of magical. It was amazing.

232
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
So...

233
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,120
let's not fuck that up.

234
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Okay?

235
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,520
Okay.

236
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,320
And no. I'm not, by the way.

237
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,080
- What?
- Married.

238
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,160
Okay.

239
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,400
Are you in a relationship?

240
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,000
No. Me and relationships
don't have a tendency to work out.

241
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,560
Yeah, I can understand that.

242
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,680
- To freedom.
- To freedom.

243
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,920
Now, sir, the brown hamper
is for dry cleaning

244
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,720
and the beige hamper
is for regular laundry.

245
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,120
I'm probably not gonna have
any dry cleaning

246
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,936
and I, by the way,
I can do my own clothes, man.

247
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,016
Just show me where the machines are.

248
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,600
Ms. Mendoza would
never allow that, sir.

249
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,296
Aw, man, you can call me Mike.
It's all good.

250
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,000
As you wish, sir. The loo
is through this door here.

251
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,160
The toilet, sir.

252
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,960
Right. Do you have any idea
what the fuck I'm doing here?

253
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,520
Regrettably, no, sir.

254
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,216
Yeah, but you wouldn't tell me
even if you did know, would you?

255
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,760
I would be lying
if I said I wasn't lying, sir.

256
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,160
Right. It's Mike, man.
Just call me Mike.

257
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,000
Well, "Mike," Ms. Mendoza
does love a good surprise.

258
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,040
I'll collect you at half past.

259
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,240
Collect me at half past
for the surprise. Cool.

260
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,320
Shit.

261
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,640
I never like to give credit to Victor
because he becomes unbearable...

262
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,000
but I wouldn't own the place
that we're going to

263
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,120
if he hadn't convinced me
to fight for it in the settlement.

264
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,880
Her only other option was a sand
and gravel pit in High Wycombe.

265
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,400
And the only value I saw in it
was that my mother-in-law

266
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,880
didn't want to give it away.

267
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,440
But now, I have found its purpose.

268
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,800
What's my purpose there?
If we're going there.

269
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,680
Well...

270
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,520
just pretend that today is Christmas

271
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,520
and you're about to open
your presents.

272
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,160
Okay.

273
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,680
As a matter of fact

274
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,120
Victor, I think we should
stop at Liberty's first.

275
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,200
Don't you think?

276
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,200
I would let Harj know,
so that he can mentally prepare.

277
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,280
Good idea.

278
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,760
What's a Harj?

279
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,920
Hello, Harj.

280
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,400
Good afternoon, Madame Rattigan!

281
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,520
Don't you "madame" me
and it's Mendoza now.

282
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,800
(French)

283
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,000
So where's "the big tear-down"?

284
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,160
What... This does not cost that.
What is this in dollars?

285
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,000
Do you like...
What, do you drop a zero or...

286
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,040
So cute.

287
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,520
I'm telling you, weird.

288
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,200
Do you know what Victor does?

289
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,760
So you own this place?

290
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,480
I do now.

291
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,920
When this very same play
opened in 2004

292
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,120
the owner of the theater

293
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,560
fell madly in love with
this horribly insecure actress.

294
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,320
And so...

295
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,320
here's where my love story
with Roger began

296
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,480
and here is where it's going to end.

297
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,440
He must have loved your performance.

298
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,880
I had three lines.

299
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,640
Well, you certainly look the part.

300
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,800
So relax, have fun

301
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,200
and I promise there won't be
any more surprises

302
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,416
but you're gonna like this one.

303
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,440
You swear?

304
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,040
- Deal.
- Miss Mendoza!

305
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,120
Right on time as usual.

306
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,680
Stop it, Woody.
I'm half an hour late.

307
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,640
As usual. Is this...

308
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,160
Yeah, Mike, meet Woody

309
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,960
the best stage manager
in all of London.

310
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,520
Easy. I'm just here
to serve your vision, gov.

311
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,760
My vision?

312
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,920
Your vision. Let's go.

313
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
Oh, fuck.

314
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,040
Voilà.

315
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,680
Wow.

316
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,760
Right on time.

317
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,480
So what's this shit about?

318
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,960
It's the same old

319
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,480
will-she-marry-for-love
or-money bullshit.

320
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,920
So, what does she pick?
Love or money?

321
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,320
Who cares?

322
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,360
The real question is

323
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,720
why does she feel like
she has to choose?

324
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,960
Hell yeah.

325
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,456
Well, this is your joint, right?

326
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,040
Why don't you just
give them that note?

327
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,920
Oh, this is a jolly good
waste of time, isn't it?

328
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,040
Bravo! Bravo, everybody.

329
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,560
Absolutely flawless, thank you.

330
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,040
Excuse me? Who the fuck is talking?

331
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,720
Oh. Maxandra. My sincere apologies.
I couldn't see you in the light.

332
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,760
Nice to see you again...

333
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,640
- Matthew.
- Right.

334
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,760
- The director.
- Of course.

335
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,840
To what do we owe the pleasure?

336
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,480
I'm here to make an announcement.

337
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,520
Oh! Oh. Tell me.

338
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,640
Well, if I only told you it wouldn't
be an announcement, would it?

339
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,760
I suppose not.

340
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,600
Attention, everyone!
Gang, this is Maxandra Rattigan.

341
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,040
The wife of our owner

342
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,200
- and...
- Actually

343
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,400
it's Maxandra Mendoza

344
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,840
and I'm the legal owner
of this theater.

345
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,160
I am here to give you all notice

346
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,280
Isabel Ascendant is closed...

347
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,600
effective immediately.

348
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,280
On what fucking grounds?
We are at capacity every night!

349
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,360
Relax.

350
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,560
It's only
a four-week course correction.

351
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,000
An evolution.

352
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,800
A revelation.

353
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,280
And no one is fired.

354
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,240
Oh, Christ.

355
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,760
Except for...

356
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,920
- Matthew.
- Matthew. Yes.

357
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,000
Matthew will be replaced

358
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,040
by a brilliant new choreographer

359
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,600
that I recently discovered in Miami.

360
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,040
His artistry made me feel...

361
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,760
There are no words. It's just...

362
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,680
ecstasy.

363
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,520
And in exactly one month

364
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,360
I want every woman
that walks into this theater

365
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,880
to feel the same kind
of ecstasy that I did.

366
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,360
To transcend.

367
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,880
To break free.

368
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,160
So, without further ado

369
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,720
I give you
the visionary artist that...

370
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,720
inspired me so profoundly

371
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,000
and that will take us
to the promised land.

372
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,400
Ladies and gentlemen

373
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,880
Michael Jeffrey Lane.

374
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
'Sup?

375
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,640
The look on Roger's face
when he sees this!

376
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,760
It's worth every pound

377
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,840
- every shilling.
- No. Yeah. You could've given me

378
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,000
just a little heads-up before
you threw me to the wolves in there!

379
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,640
You would've been in your head,
over-thinking everything.

380
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,920
It was better than
not thinking anything at all. Like...

381
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,520
And what are you so excited about?

382
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,200
Like every single person
in there quit!

383
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,880
We don't need actors,
we need dancers.

384
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,920
Plus, by not firing them

385
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,280
we saved thousands
on labor-union fees.

386
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,360
More money for you.

387
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,840
Yeah, but... Okay. I...
Look, no offense

388
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,840
but there's got to be easier ways
to get back at your husband for...

389
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,160
I don't know, whatever,
than putting on a strip show.

390
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,920
Oh, I'm not a scorned woman,
and this is not a strip show.

391
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,240
We are bringing
the tsunami to London!

392
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,160
Okay. All right. This...

393
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,056
And I'm down for that.
I just think that you haven't...

394
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,160
Can't you see? People are numb,
disconnected, desensitized.

395
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,880
We're gonna wake them up

396
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,400
with a wave of passion
they've never felt before.

397
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,000
Okay, I just...
There's one little thing

398
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,280
that I think you're forgetting

399
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,600
is that I don't know shit
about directing theater.

400
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,320
- And that's why you have me!
- What?

401
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,600
It will be a historical,
one-night collaboration

402
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,720
between the stage

403
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,280
- and the...
- The thongs?

404
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,360
Eh, I don't know.

405
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,360
- Exactly. That's what...
- Who the hell are you?

406
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,640
I don't know. Who are you?

407
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,000
Zadie, what are you doing here?

408
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,880
This is my daughter, Zadie.

409
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,000
Oh, shit. Hi. Nice to meet you!

410
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,600
- We had a meeting, Maxandra.
- Yeah.

411
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,320
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

412
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,480
I completely lost track of time.
Completely. I'm so sorry.

413
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,920
I can see that. I'm more interested
in why you lost track of time.

414
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,480
Well, I've been handling
some business

415
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,680
with the new director
of Isabel Ascendant.

416
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,800
Michael Jeffrey Lane.

417
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,560
Ah, yeah. That's not my name.

418
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,936
- But... It's just...
- But it's got gravitas.

419
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,680
Yeah, it's just... It's Mike Lane.

420
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,856
- But you do need a stage name.
- Are you two hooking up?

421
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,000
- Zadie!
- Well, I...

422
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,240
What's funny about that is...

423
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,480
your mom actually
is paying me to not hook up.

424
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,240
We are not hooking up.

425
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,560
But he will be staying at the house
just until he gets settled. Okay?

426
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,880
How convenient.

427
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,240
Tell me, Mike, what do you plan
to do with Act Three?

428
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,880
Yeah, we're gonna have one.

429
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,520
I was pl... I was planning
on doing Act Three

430
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,880
- like a...
- Everybody knows

431
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,000
<i>Isabel Ascendant</i> has

432
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,720
a wildly outdated,
painfully misogynistic climax.

433
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,040
Exactly.

434
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,960
And that's why our take
is going to be so exciting

435
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,720
because they will be expecting that

436
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,200
and instead, they're gonna see

437
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,120
that a woman can have whatever
she wants, whenever she wants it.

438
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,680
Since when do you believe that?

439
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,680
Since Mike and I have
been exploring this theme.

440
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,360
Yeah, your m... Yeah,
we've been exploring those themes.

441
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,400
You're in another one
of your phases, aren't you?

442
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,240
Baby, don't you have
some schoolwork to do?

443
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,240
What's the phases thing?

444
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,000
Every few years
she starts a big new project.

445
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,480
Sometimes it's a charity,
a documentary

446
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,240
- a new best friend.
- Right.

447
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,200
Each time it's like
she's a new person.

448
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,560
So what?

449
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:39,000
Sue me for exploring myself
and my contributions to the world!

450
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,880
But your contributions
never see the light of day.

451
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,280
There's always some obstacle.

452
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,736
We call her
The Queen of the First Act.

453
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,960
Our therapist,
whom she stood up to be here

454
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,760
says she tries on these new personas

455
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,600
as a way from running
from the guilt about...

456
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,280
I already said how sorry I am
about missing that appointment

457
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,560
and I am going to reschedule it.

458
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:02,160
(French)

459
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,320
(French)

460
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,320
(French)

461
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,320
(French)

462
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,240
You know, pardon my French,
but y'all are being rude as fuck.

463
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,320
Sorry.

464
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,680
(French)

465
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,160
Pleasure, Mike.

466
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,360
- Pleasure, Zadie.
- Zadie, wait, don't go.

467
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,040
You want some cake? Baby.

468
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,440
What's going on?

469
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,160
No, I didn't know until you sent it.

470
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,080
Well, technically,
she does have the right.

471
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,120
I have no idea.
Maybe Zadie will tell me.

472
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,400
Change the agreement how?

473
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,640
Mother... Mother, I think
you should pursue this on your own.

474
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,320
I can't get dragged into a fight.
Not about this, not right now.

475
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,920
Yo!

476
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,160
<i>Holy shit! Naysayers,
we have proof of life!</i>

477
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,720
<i>All right.</i>

478
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,600
What's up, man?
I know, look, I know. I-I...

479
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,320
And I'm sorry, okay, I know
I've been ducking you all.

480
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,960
I apologize. I just...

481
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,200
It's a long story, but I'm in London
and I just want you guys to know

482
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,920
I'm gonna be able to pay you back,
I just need a few weeks. Okay?

483
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,560
<i>Oh, come on, man!</i>

484
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,360
<i>How many times do we have to tell you
you don't need to pay us back!</i>

485
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,920
<i>It was an investment.</i>

486
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,200
I know. I know. But I'm...

487
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,336
As many times as you guys say that,

488
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,640
I'm not just gonna burn
my friends' money and not care.

489
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,880
- All right? I don't...
- <i>No.</i>

490
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,120
<i>Money is water, Mike.
It flows in both directions.</i>

491
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,920
That's a good point, but still.

492
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,120
<i>You... Yeah, hold up.
You buried the lede here.</i>

493
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,560
<i>Why are you in London?</i>

494
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,680
I don't know, short story is that...

495
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,560
I was bartending
at this charity event

496
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,736
and then at the end of the night

497
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,000
I ended up giving
this rich lady a lap dance

498
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,960
and now I'm living
in her house in London

499
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,200
and gonna put on a show

500
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,960
at this famous theater
that she owns. So, yeah.

501
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,920
<i>Cool. Hey, sex work is nothing
to be embarrassed about, Mikey.</i>

502
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,680
<i>Especially when
it's the live-in kind.</i>

503
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,960
Hey, look, thanks, Tarzan.

504
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,280
Look, I'm basically just saying

505
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,560
though I'm gonna have your money,
I don't exactly know

506
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,560
what I said yes to
so I hope it works out.

507
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,520
<i>Mikey, Mikey, this is great news.</i>

508
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,480
<i>I was looking
at your chart last night</i>

509
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,040
<i>you know you're in a once-
in-33-year Jupiter cycle, right?</i>

510
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,520
<i>I... No, I didn't, but
that explains a lot I guess. Yeah.</i>

511
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,800
<i>Yeah, it does,
so whatever existential confusion</i>

512
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,880
<i>you're feeling right now,</i>

513
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,320
<i>it's an initiation.</i>

514
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,640
<i>It's wiping the slate clean
for you to self-actualize.</i>

515
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,520
I'm just trying to survive

516
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,920
- to be honest.
- <i>Surviving? Bro</i>

517
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,560
<i>you are a gig worker.</i>

518
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,000
<i>Magic Mike's coming back
to the main stage.</i>

519
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,736
I... But that's the thing,
I'm not even dancing though.

520
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,960
I'm putting on the show.
I guess I'm directing or whatever.

521
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,760
I mean, it's...
I'm only here for a month

522
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,240
it's for one show only

523
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,760
to basically get back
at her ex or something.

524
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,800
I don't know.
It's totally bonkers over here.

525
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,200
<i>Who gives a shit, man?
She's rich. Trust me.</i>

526
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,720
<i>Do not leave that situation. Okay?</i>

527
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,560
<i>Look at me, I'm basically
a freaking glorified dog walker.</i>

528
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,360
<i>Okay? You just need to make sure
she doesn't wake up</i>

529
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,520
<i>and all of a sudden
want you out of the house</i>

530
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,800
<i>which I have tips on
by the way if you want them.</i>

531
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,320
Okay. I... We don't have dogs here,
so maybe that's a good idea.

532
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,320
<i>I feel it. I feel it
in my solar plexus, brother.</i>

533
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,880
<i>This is your dharma.</i>

534
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,200
- <i>Just stay in the flow.</i>
- Victor?

535
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,920
What are you doing there?

536
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,680
Oh, you know, waiting
for passing fucking trade.

537
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,320
He's on a private call.

538
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,040
Since when has that stopped you?

539
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,520
<i>Oh, boys, I miss you.</i>

540
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,160
Are you decent?

541
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,520
- Yep.
- <i>Is that her?</i>

542
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,920
Are we interrupting something?

543
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,800
No, I was just looking
for some ideas.

544
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,160
Oh, I've been "scouting" myself.

545
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,720
And come take a look
at what I found.

546
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,360
Look at that.

547
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,840
Isn't he magnificent?

548
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,240
He has such an innate elegance
and intelligence to the way he moves.

549
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,800
And then at the same time
there's this savage thing, you know

550
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,200
like a primal animal.

551
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,200
Just incredible.

552
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,200
I think this is
what we need for the show.

553
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,520
Trained dancers, not strippers.

554
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,000
Yeah, but, I mean,
as the director, I...

555
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,480
I promise you I know exactly
what we're looking for. Yeah.

556
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,280
I love the way you just did that.

557
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,400
- What?
- "As the director."

558
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,960
You're really owning
that place. You know?

559
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,280
It comes to you so naturally.

560
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,240
I can tell that
you already have a vision.

561
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,400
And I'm sure that you agree
that this would be fantastic.

562
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,136
- Yeah, he's great.
- For the show, I mean.

563
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,560
Yeah. Yeah, really. I mean, he's...

564
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,000
Antonio is what we need.

565
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,680
He's great. Like I said,
he's just... But he's also in Italy.

566
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,240
- Roma.
- Roma, see, I can't...

567
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,520
I don't have time
to go find him in Roma

568
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,736
and then bring him
all the way back here.

569
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,520
Oh, no. That would be
out of the question.

570
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,040
But that's why
you have a genius producer!

571
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:24,160
He's arriving on Thursday.
If you approve. Creatively, I mean.

572
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,080
Yeah, look, if you want him, sure.
I-I-I approve. Creatively, of course.

573
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,480
I'm so excited!

574
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,240
Are you excited?

575
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,840
Yeah. Yeah. I am.

576
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,000
You don't sound excited.

577
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,800
I'm very, very, very excited.

578
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,416
- I promise.
- Oh, man, me, I don't even think

579
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,960
I'm gonna be able to sleep.

580
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,560
No?

581
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,320
Good night.

582
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,200
Sweet dreams.

583
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,520
Okay.

584
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,400
Wait, wait, where are you going? Hey.

585
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,840
To bed?

586
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,560
We got like
ten other dancers to find.

587
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,760
And that's why we have Renata.
Good night.

588
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,840
Per your instructions

589
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:26,200
I've assembled the top-tier of talent
across multiple movement disciplines.

590
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,600
And they're all
very eager to please...

591
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,160
and quite athletic,
as you requested.

592
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,520
Excellent work as usual, Renata.

593
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,800
<i>She couldn't explain
the full extent of her feelings</i>

594
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,400
<i>but Max knew that she had crossed
some kind of strange Rubicon.</i>

595
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,600
<i>She was desperate to know more
about why she felt this way</i>

596
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,040
<i>so she purchased a litany of books
on the history of dance.</i>

597
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,920
<i>For Mike, The Rattigan
had no symbolic weight</i>

598
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,320
<i>it was simply where he had to work.</i>

599
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,080
<i>And he reminded himself</i>

600
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,400
<i>in order to finish something,
you have to make a start.</i>

601
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,080
<i>For Maxandra, The Rattigan
had been transformed.</i>

602
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,920
<i>It went from
existing only in the past</i>

603
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,760
<i>to being a source of renewal.</i>

604
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,360
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hey! Hey!

605
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,640
Are you ready
to transform theater forever?

606
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,400
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

607
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,120
All right. Calm down, calm down.
We ain't done shit yet.

608
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,840
All right, you guys have
all the talent in the world.

609
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,000
Ain't no questioning that.

610
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,056
Each and every single person here
was hand selected because they bring

611
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,520
something unique to the table
that we ain't never seen before.

612
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,280
All right?

613
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,800
But I have a question for you.

614
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,080
Who here, by show of hands, has
stood in front of a thousand women

615
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,400
and had to get butt-ass naked?

616
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,600
Exactly.

617
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,520
You want to find out how fast

618
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,880
a group of sweet, nurturing moms can
make you just go running

619
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,320
cowering into a dark corner,
wishing you were never born?

620
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,760
I promise you it can happen.
I've seen it. And it can happen

621
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,040
just like that.

622
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,576
Now I can't believe I'm about
to say these words out loud

623
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,080
but we got one month.

624
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,200
Oh, yeah.

625
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,640
We got one month to turn y'all
into the greatest group of strippers

626
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,360
that has ever been assembled
on planet Earth.

627
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,056
And to do that, you boys got to be
ready to get your hands dirty

628
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,240
your noses wet,
and them nuts chafed as shit.

629
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,920
And look, if,
if we do our jobs right...

630
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,440
you're gonna have
a whole other problem on your hands.

631
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,200
You're gonna have to learn to

632
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,880
protect yourself in a zombie
apocalypse of repressed desire.

633
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,200
Any questions?

634
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,480
I have a question.

635
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,400
Can you, you know,
fuck a zombie to death?

636
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,280
Or is it still a kill shot
to the head?

637
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,200
Excuse me, what are you doing here?

638
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,640
I mean, you didn't
technically fire me

639
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:52,600
so I'm still drawing out that salary.

640
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,040
Oh, I'm sorry.
I should have been more clear.

641
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,760
You're still getting paid,
but we no longer need your services.

642
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,160
I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up.

643
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,040
I was just really inspired
by our new director's vision.

644
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,640
What... What did I say?

645
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,080
He didn't say anything.

646
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,640
It's not what you said.
It's who you are.

647
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,800
Do you have any idea of
how long I've been dreaming

648
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,240
of someone to walk through
that door with a flame thrower

649
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,560
and burn this whole fucking shit
to the ground?

650
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,000
I can't stand playing Lady Isabel.

651
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,160
For the last six months

652
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:33,040
I've wanted to choke the life
out of that entitled prude.

653
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,120
I mean, get a grip, woman.
Jesus Christ.

654
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,680
Like you're rich,
send a fucking carriage to town

655
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,560
buy up every able-bodied man,
soldier, sailor

656
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,400
instead of wasting your time
worrying about which boring old sod

657
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,000
you're going
to sign your life away to

658
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:51,640
and have a lovely half-decent shag
with every last one! I...

659
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,560
But it's a really good job,
it's so stable, and...

660
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,120
so usually I don't say all of that.

661
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,120
Well, that was poetic.

662
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,560
You're definitely our audience.

663
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,560
Woody, make sure
she gets an invitation.

664
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,720
Hey, we're still calling this
<i>Isabel Ascendant,</i> right?

665
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,456
Yeah, but that's just a trick
to get the audience into the theater

666
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,736
so then we can give them
something else.

667
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,040
Right, but if, what if we use

668
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,120
the actual old opening
to <i>Isabel Ascendant</i>?

669
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,560
I mean, it could be
a really big surprise actually.

670
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,320
And if I'm honest...

671
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,920
if you want to make a show
about women getting what they want

672
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,456
wouldn't it be
a little fucking chauvinistic

673
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,840
to not have a female lead in it?

674
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,600
- Are you calling me chauvinistic?
- No.

675
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,880
Because I'm the feminist here.

676
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,320
- Right.
- I'm the flame-thrower.

677
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,360
This whole thing was my idea.

678
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,240
You heard her.
She's the flame-thrower.

679
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,080
You're hired as Isabel

680
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,400
because you were already hired.

681
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,880
I am thrilled!
Thank you both so much.

682
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,560
Will you be dancing in it?

683
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,120
No. Just directing. Right?

684
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,480
Shame.

685
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,400
Well, now that we have
a leading lady again

686
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,000
maybe the director should walk us
through the beats of the first act.

687
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,640
Yep. First act, coming up.

688
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,240
Enter Jackson, the low-class
but sexy friend of the husband. Line?

689
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,296
Harold said you didn't want
to go to Calais this year.

690
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,320
Is that still settled?

691
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,680
I'm sick to death of Calais.

692
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,240
- Theo?
- I won't hear of it.

693
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,600
You're going and that's that.

694
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,200
Perfect. Hit it.

695
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,280
Oh, come on. No... no. Come on, Mike.

696
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,600
- Stop... Stop!
- Hey. All right, stop... stop.

697
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,760
Stop. What's up?

698
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,640
They can't just start dancing
on her out of nowhere.

699
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,880
I mean, I'm down as fuck.

700
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,640
Okay. Isn't that the point?

701
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,080
No, no, no.
You cannot interrupt the plot.

702
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,880
If you want a strong female lead,
she has to have an objective.

703
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,760
At least we should know
what she wants.

704
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,920
Okay. What do you think
she wants then?

705
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,280
I don't know.

706
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,880
I know she doesn't want this life.

707
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,360
So she wants to run away?

708
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,160
She can't do that.

709
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,560
Why? She's a free person, right?

710
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,240
She has a family.
There would be consequences.

711
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,880
Right. So it's about the money.

712
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,360
Oh, that's the least of it.

713
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,720
She would lose her friends,
opportunities.

714
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,280
Her identity. Her whole world
would be torn apart.

715
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,496
I don't know. It sounds to me
that she just needs to let go.

716
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,880
And some good dick!

717
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,960
Maybe that as well.

718
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,360
This show is not about
getting dick. Only.

719
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,200
She needs to solve her dilemma.

720
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,200
It's not like some magic unicorn
is gonna come down

721
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,280
and make all her wildest fantasies
come true.

722
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,520
What was that?

723
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,160
Could be not the worst idea.

724
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,680
Oh, no way.

725
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,400
Hear me out. Just... What about...

726
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,560
Where the fuck
am I gonna get a horse?

727
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,280
What about a caballito?
Like a tiny one.

728
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,600
I don't have caballito budget.

729
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,496
Wait. What... How... Okay,
what if you don't see it?

730
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,800
What if you don't see the horse?

731
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,760
No, that's not right.

732
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,280
No.

733
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,880
How long have you
been standing there?

734
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,600
Long enough. May I?

735
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Yes.

736
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,360
So you've worked with Max
and this Roger dude a long time?

737
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,960
All 18 wonderful years.

738
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,616
Wow. So you must know these friends
that we're going to see tonight.

739
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,640
What are they like?

740
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,680
They like things
to stay the same, sir.

741
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,800
All right.

742
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,400
How do I look? And don't
give me any bullshit answer.

743
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,000
You know something...

744
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,520
they'd just laugh at you in a tie.

745
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,160
- Holy shit.
- What?

746
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,240
You! That suit.

747
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,160
You look incredibly expensive.

748
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,760
You have no idea.

749
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,760
<i>One of the most primal feelings
human beings experience</i>

750
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,480
<i>is the desire to belong</i>

751
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,040
<i>to feel connected to other beings,
and to be part of a tribe.</i>

752
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,920
<i>In fact, brain scans have shown
that social rejection creates</i>

753
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,320
<i>virtually identical brain activity
as physical assault.</i>

754
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,960
<i>Mike didn't know that</i>

755
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,400
<i>but he knew dancing could
bring people together.</i>

756
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,560
<i>Even if some of those people
are snobs.</i>

757
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,120
<i>And he knew that Victor was right</i>

758
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,880
they would have laughed
at him in a tie.

759
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,520
And he says, "Now
that's how you wave a towel!"

760
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,080
Every time.

761
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,400
Anyways, so, give us
the latest gossip, Max.

762
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,680
- Yeah, go on.
- And don't hold back a lick.

763
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,840
You know I don't hold back my licks.

764
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,256
- True.
- But there's nothing for me

765
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,280
to tell you.

766
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,800
You already know everything.

767
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,080
Since you double agents
are all talking to Roger.

768
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,480
- Oh, come on.
- That's not true.

769
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,856
- That's not true.
- I'm offended.

770
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,160
Last I heard, he had at least
broken it off with the girl. So...

771
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,360
And so, she should just run
back to him then, should she?

772
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,200
No, that's not what I'm implying.

773
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,096
I'm just... You know,
it's something, isn't it?

774
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,200
- It takes time, Bill.
- Of course.

775
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,560
Or have you forgotten?

776
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,000
Ooh, hello.

777
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,840
Thank you for your concern,
but you must know that...

778
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,680
I'm the happiest
I've ever been in my life.

779
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,960
- Oh, that's really good to hear.
- Oh, rubbish.

780
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,680
Phoebe!

781
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
He can do whatever he wants,
and so can I.

782
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,520
- Yeah.
- How modern.

783
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,456
But what does that actually
mean for the divorce?

784
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,560
The divorce. The divorce.

785
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,000
Don't you have something else
to talk about?

786
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,000
I mean, besides, Bill jokes.
Let's have fun.

787
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,040
Mike, why don't you tell them...

788
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,120
Wait, no, listen to this.

789
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,760
You have to hear his vision
for <i>Isabel Ascendant.</i>

790
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,880
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yes.

791
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,880
Uh, yeah. Well, I mean

792
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,640
as we were talking about
we think it's...

793
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,160
it's very important to honor
the original source material.

794
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,880
- Yeah, but to do that properly...
- And say no more.

795
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,880
It has to be a surprise.

796
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,400
- Right.
- Okay.

797
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,200
It's so smart to revive a classic.

798
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,960
- Absolutely.
- That is very hot right now.

799
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,280
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't know

800
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,960
if I would exactly call it
a classic revival, Phoebe, but I...

801
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,856
You know, the way that I think
we were looking at it is

802
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,320
that it really needed to be
stripped down, oiled, and spanked.

803
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,880
(Spanish)

804
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,360
- No. No. (Spanish)
- Okay.

805
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,160
He loves metaphors.

806
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,880
So Mike, is there a vibrant
theatrical community in Miami?

807
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,096
Yeah, for the right amount of dollars

808
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,480
I think you can have as vibrant
of a time as you would like.

809
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,120
I imagine you've done
a lot of work with Art Basel.

810
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,080
No, no. I don't...
Who's that? I don't know him.

811
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,640
- Come on, guys.
- Oh, my God.

812
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,800
Of course, I know Art Basel.
It's the most famous art fair.

813
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,120
It happens in my city
every single year.

814
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,720
Wow. Your face just now...

815
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,920
Well, I mean, if the show's
anything like him, count me in.

816
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,760
You better talk to him while you can

817
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:49,920
because he's about to get
super famous and super unavailable.

818
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,200
- Wow.
- Well, that's quite a build-up.

819
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,880
- That's a deal.
- Yeah.

820
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,440
I don't know about all that, but yes.

821
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,960
She is looking
unusually radiant tonight.

822
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,200
Yeah, I guess...

823
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,040
I don't know. It must be good
for the soul, the whole divorce.

824
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:06,960
Divorce.

825
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,400
Yeah, I'm... What?

826
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,160
Do you guys have a different word
for the ending of a marriage here?

827
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,760
Yeah. When it's untrue. Yeah.

828
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,680
I mean, yes, they have
an agreement at the moment.

829
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,760
- Yeah.
- But

830
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:21,480
I mean, that family pre-nup is
going to take a decade to litigate.

831
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,680
- Exactly.
- Plus she knows

832
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,576
that at the end of it
she'll get absolutely nothing.

833
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,656
- Which she'll hate.
- Yeah.

834
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,480
What she needs is
to be able to stay with him

835
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,120
but not actually be with him.

836
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,840
That would be the golden ticket.

837
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:35,200
I wish you had gotten up,
and really taken

838
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,656
- your clothes off.
- Okay, let's go back there.

839
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,496
- I'd have loved to see their faces.
- I'll take my clothes off right now.

840
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,200
- Yeah.
- They are so fake.

841
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,720
They are the fakest people I know.

842
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,320
I think the only person
that is real in my life is Zadie.

843
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,976
She's about as real
as it gets at times.

844
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,080
Yes. She'll tell you what she thinks.

845
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,560
What about you, Mike?

846
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,560
Are you real?

847
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,760
What do you mean, am I real?
Am I... Do you think I'm real?

848
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,800
I don't know.

849
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,400
You know, sometimes
you kind of feel like a dream.

850
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,000
I mean, you look like a dream.

851
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,000
You smell like a dream.

852
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,920
You taste like a dream.

853
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,920
Wait. I just want
to make sure. Listen.

854
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,240
No, it's okay. No.

855
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,456
- No. I get it. I get it.
- No... no. Wait, wait, wait. No

856
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,976
- That was really stupid.
- I just want to tell you... No...

857
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,056
- No, no. I'm sorry. I didn't...
- You know what?

858
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,416
- I shouldn't have stopped...
- I'm sorry, I'm just so drunk.

859
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,320
What? You had, like,
one glass of wine.

860
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,681
- No, look, that was my fault.
- Are you saying I'm crazy?

861
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,136
No, I'm definitely not saying

862
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,536
- you're crazy. I'm saying I'm sorry.
- Are you telling me I'm crazy?

863
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,776
- I didn't mean to stop you.
- This was uncalled for so obviously

864
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,920
- Come here. I'm sorry.
- If I'm not drunk, I'm crazy.

865
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,400
- Stop. Hey...
- And I'm not crazy.

866
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,456
- Max, stop. I'm sorry.
- I am very drunk actually.

867
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,520
Stop. Stop.

868
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,736
- Listen to my...
- No, you stop.

869
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,200
I don't want to listen to you.

870
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:00,520
Right now, anything that you say
to me is gonna be wrong.

871
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,560
I already said I'm sorry.
Okay? I get it.

872
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,360
I get it. You don't have to like...

873
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,440
rub it in.

874
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,920
- All right.
- No pity talking or anything.

875
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,040
I get it.

876
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,800
Can you put some music on, Victor?

877
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,200
Oh, hello. Good morning.

878
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,360
Good morning.

879
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,080
What are you doing up so early?

880
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,680
I'm writing a novel.

881
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,880
A novel?

882
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,320
They make you write novels
in school over here?

883
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,600
Do you assume that because of my age

884
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,200
I only have the mental capacity
to write a novel for school?

885
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,200
No, I just don't know anyone
that's ever written a novel.

886
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,320
What is it about?

887
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,840
It's about some people
who know each other and do things.

888
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,160
It's about every time I draw

889
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,440
another gentrified breath
into my helpless body.

890
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,960
And it's about 40 pages.

891
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,960
That's a good amount of pages.

892
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,640
- It is.
- How many are you gonna go for?

893
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,560
A few more.

894
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,800
- What's up, Vic?
- Yeah, right.

895
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,800
What? What? Why is he like that?

896
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,240
If he acts like he likes you,
he hates you.

897
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,000
And if he acts like he hates you

898
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,760
it's a sign of respect
because he actually does hate you.

899
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:45,800
Yeah, that's not helpful.
Why doesn't he just quit?

900
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:49,000
Same reason you don't quit.
Systemic economic inequality.

901
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,440
Speaking of, have you seen
Maxandra this morning?

902
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,760
No. And why do you call her that?

903
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,840
You know she hates it.

904
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,136
She brought me from an orphanage

905
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,960
saying "mother"
would feel like a lie.

906
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,040
Come on. That's a little strong.

907
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,320
Look, she's doing the best she can.

908
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,000
And she loves the shit out of you.

909
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:09,560
I think the real question is
why do you love the shit out of her?

910
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,560
Love is
a really, really big word, Zadie.

911
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,720
And, look, the truth is

912
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,040
no one's believed in me
like your mom has

913
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,520
- so I...
- Zadie?

914
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,200
- Hi, Roger.
- Hello, dear.

915
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,680
That's your...

916
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:26,960
Is your mother around?

917
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,120
Maxandra is upstairs.

918
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,200
And who's this?

919
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,640
This is Mike.

920
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,600
Mike is the new director
for <i>Isabel Ascendant.</i>

921
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,000
- Ah, right.
- What's up?

922
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,760
Roger Rattigan.

923
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,760
Michael Jeffrey Lane.

924
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,080
I hope Max didn't schedule to meet
both of us at the same time.

925
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,360
He's staying here.

926
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,200
Well, no conflict then.

927
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,040
No.

928
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,680
I hope the theater itself
has treated you well thus far.

929
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,640
Oh, she's been a pleasure
to be inside of.

930
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,400
It's got such a wonderful feel.

931
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,000
I'm looking forward to seeing
how you improve such a classic.

932
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,000
I can't wait for you
to experience it.

933
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,240
It's a little rough, so be nice.

934
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:11,720
- Okay.
- Woods.

935
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:12,800
Sound. Go.

936
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,440
Bravo.

937
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,120
Bravo.

938
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,480
Bravo. Bellissimo. Now that is class.

939
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,640
Yeah. No, that was great.

940
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,720
Yeah, I got to figure out
where it goes in the show.

941
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,320
But, yeah, it was... It was great.

942
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,360
All right, Harry, let's go.

943
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,360
Give it to her.

944
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,680
Take your time, boy.

945
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:11,920
Show her.

946
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:19,960
Yep.

947
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:21,920
That's it.

948
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,320
Hey, give her the business.

949
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,360
That's it. That's it.

950
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,080
All right, sick.

951
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,680
Look, I mean, you can't dance
any better than that. That's perfect.

952
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,336
I mean, the only...
If I had a little note

953
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,640
it would just be
this specific dance is

954
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,800
a little more like fucking
than dancing.

955
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,360
And you know, look,
the song is called <i>Permission</i>

956
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,480
so once you get permission

957
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,736
you got to keep it, and you got to...

958
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,360
The only way to do that is
to keep a connection with her.

959
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,816
Here, watch. Look, see if
you can see the difference. Like...

960
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,640
literally you don't even
have to dance at all.

961
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,600
- Hi.
- Hey.

962
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,520
- Can I touch you?
- Of course.

963
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,640
- Yeah? You sure?
- Yeah.

964
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,920
Woody... Woody.

965
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,000
I don't understand.

966
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:04,320
You have
this beautiful legendary stage

967
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,680
but you're hovering
around the chair.

968
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,760
I mean, you can do the same...

969
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,920
over here, or your...

970
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,600
over there.

971
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,720
No woman wants
to be suffocated by testículos.

972
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,280
- That's fair.
- It's nice to expand, you know?

973
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,800
Okay.

974
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,120
Less testiculars and expansion.

975
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,960
<i>Some scholars suggest that dance
was once a form of communication</i>

976
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,120
<i>as integral to our daily life
as eating or sleeping.</i>

977
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,520
<i>Traditionally,
tribal courtship dances</i>

978
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,240
<i>allowed dancers of opposite sexes</i>

979
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:21,160
<i>to engage in
socially acceptable physical contact</i>

980
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,600
<i>before they were even allowed
to speak to one another.</i>

981
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,520
<i>Only when a leisure class began</i>

982
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,800
<i>to emerge out of
early economic development</i>

983
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,800
<i>did humans begin to view dance
as a source of pleasure apart</i>

984
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,440
<i>from its original purpose</i>

985
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,680
<i>to bridge people together
from different worlds</i>

986
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,480
<i>to heal wounds
when words would not suffice.</i>

987
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,400
All right, you all ready?

988
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,360
Play back.

989
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,120
All right. Stop!

990
00:58:58,680 --> 00:58:59,720
Stop the music!

991
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,680
- Stop!
- Hey! Excuse me

992
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,480
who the hell are you?

993
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,680
City of Westminster.

994
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,720
Historical Architecture
High Committee.

995
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:12,560
Well, I'm the owner of this theater.
Is there a problem?

996
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,880
Oh, I would think so.

997
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,280
Anything else?

998
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,040
You'll be hearing from us.

999
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,040
We're fucked.

1000
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,960
"The owner must obtain
written approval

1001
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,880
"to make material changes
to property.

1002
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,640
"If changes be made without
approval or special exemption

1003
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:44,400
"the owner must restore the theater
to its original condition

1004
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,360
and then file for approval
with the city."

1005
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,600
This is Roger trying to control me.

1006
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:53,400
Even though we are separated
and in the middle of a divorce

1007
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,200
because he fucked the assistant.

1008
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,160
I'm sorry, baby,
but it's not like it's a secret.

1009
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,200
What if we just do it anyway?

1010
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,000
I mean, what are they
really gonna do?

1011
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:09,600
"Failure to comply will result
in a fine of 10,000 pounds per day

1012
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,120
and/or seizure of the property
by the City."

1013
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,480
Even if I pay the fine

1014
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:17,080
he'll find a way
to exert pressure on these people

1015
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,200
and force them to bend the rules.

1016
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,280
That's just the way he operates.
Isn't it, Victor?

1017
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:22,656
- Well, in my opinion...
- We have to go

1018
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,880
all the way to the top
because our freedom is an illusion.

1019
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,040
Yes, see when you start

1020
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,536
- with no rights at all...
- So who is this person

1021
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,680
we need to seduce
and get them on our side?

1022
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,080
I.e., the definition of corruption.

1023
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,040
Zadie, baby...

1024
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,240
you should know
that the law is useless

1025
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:42,080
when you're dealing with
entrenched male power structures.

1026
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,760
- Not all male.
- What do you mean?

1027
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,200
Edna Eaglebauer.

1028
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,880
As the chairwoman, she has the power
to grant a special exemption.

1029
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,280
Hey, Z, what else
do we know about Edna?

1030
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,760
Not much about her on Google.

1031
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,440
Housing records indicate she's
most likely single and lives alone.

1032
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:03,560
That's promising.

1033
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,480
She's got no presence
on social media.

1034
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:10,080
Asides her bio
on the council website.

1035
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,080
Check if she has a pet or a hobby.

1036
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:16,840
Not that I can tell. She's a ghost.

1037
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,040
I'll tell you what

1038
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,416
this bird's got to have
a heart of stone

1039
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,640
to shut down <i>Swan Lake.</i>

1040
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,120
Maybe, but everybody wants something.

1041
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,560
We just got to keep looking.

1042
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,200
What if she didn't even know
what she wants?

1043
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:23,560
Well, that never stopped men
from coming up with the wrong answer.

1044
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,520
Come on, guys, give me something.

1045
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:26,920
Victor, don't just sit there.

1046
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,680
I'll murder her for the right price.

1047
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,200
That might be the best idea.

1048
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,440
But, look, this feels like

1049
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,000
a woman's perspective
sort of a thing.

1050
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,000
Like what did you want before Miami?

1051
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,280
I just wanted to escape my life.

1052
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:40,080
But then...

1053
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:48,200
someone came along and gave me
this unexpected magical moment

1054
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,480
that made me remember
who I really was.

1055
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,320
It was like a little treasure.

1056
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,160
Okay, so we need
to figure out who Edna was

1057
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,880
before she became a bureaucrat
and tap into that then.

1058
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:01,200
That's it!

1059
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,496
- I don't understand why you don't
- I don't think...

1060
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,456
- want <i>Suavemente.</i> It's a great song.
- No. I love <i>Suavemente.</i>

1061
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,216
- It is great. I agree.
- It's a different beat.

1062
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,520
We just don't need it right now.

1063
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,520
Look, it... Look,
hear me out. It's <i>Isabel</i>

1064
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,416
- Oh, trust me. I know it by heart.
- Unicorn, <i>Champagne</i>

1065
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,056
- <i>Sex Machine, Permission,</i> Suits.
- And you know what's more important

1066
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:53,200
than <i>Suavemente</i>?
We still don't have a grand finale.

1067
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,320
Great. We'll make one.

1068
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,496
- The most important part
- It's a group number.

1069
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:56,896
- Of the whole show.
- And then everybody will dance out

1070
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,520
into the crowd. It'll be amazing.

1071
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,240
Oh, that's so random.

1072
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:02,376
- Everybody dancing in the crowd.
- Why is that random?

1073
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,600
We've done that already.

1074
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:06,280
It's got to be something different,
something personal.

1075
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,656
They're all good and personal,
and they're there for a reason.

1076
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:09,976
I don't... Why are you
doing this right now?

1077
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,240
Why are you making it, like,
we don't have a good show?

1078
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:15,920
I know. You should be dancing in it.

1079
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,600
You have lost your mind.
What are you talking about?

1080
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:20,096
- I'm not dancing in the show.
- Why are you saying no

1081
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,120
to everything I say?

1082
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,576
- Have you noticed that?
- I'm not saying no. I've said yes

1083
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,736
- on every single part of the show.
- We need something

1084
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,480
climactic, different

1085
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,240
- something personal.
- All right, I'm...

1086
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,400
- Give me something
- Great

1087
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:31,536
- that I don't know about you.
- Then do something personal.

1088
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,480
Why is it about me?
This is about women.

1089
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:34,720
You're a woman. I'm not.

1090
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:37,376
I'm not gonna be dancing in the show.
Why don't you make it personal?

1091
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,720
Well, do whatever you want.

1092
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,800
Do the thing that you and
Antonio have been making.

1093
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,080
It's great.
That's personal, ain't it?

1094
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,760
Hey, it's your show.

1095
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,480
Give me something that's yours.

1096
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:47,760
Open up.

1097
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,200
- I did.
- When?

1098
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:51,840
The whole... This whole time.

1099
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,016
And if you haven't seen it, I don't
know what to tell you about it.

1100
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,840
Well, I don't know
what to tell you about it

1101
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,440
since I tried to kiss you
and you pulled away.

1102
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,400
You don't know how to open up.

1103
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,360
That's why you need the <i>Suavemente.</i>

1104
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:05,880
Oh! Still waiting for
passing trade, you nosy fuck!

1105
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:08,760
Your turn, he's impossible.

1106
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:26,360
Yes, Victor?

1107
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:27,920
I did not say anything.

1108
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,016
Yeah. Yeah. You're always
saying something in your head.

1109
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,240
Just say it out loud, man.

1110
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:38,560
You see, the problem with Max is
she tends to overcomplicate things.

1111
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:39,840
Yeah.

1112
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,960
Especially when she knows
exactly what she wants.

1113
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:45,480
And she knows exactly what she wants
when it comes to you.

1114
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,480
Why do you work for her?

1115
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:54,160
You could easily work for Roger.

1116
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,920
She's got bigger balls.

1117
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,040
Listen, motherfucker.

1118
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:03,360
- I rest my case.
- Yeah.

1119
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:04,896
- You better make up your mind
- Oh, just...

1120
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,976
- because you're driving me crazy.
- Yeah, you're driving me crazy.

1121
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,120
What are you doing?

1122
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,760
Just stop.

1123
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:12,200
- Okay, just shut up.
- No, you stop.

1124
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:13,360
You shut up.

1125
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,360
I just want a happy ending.

1126
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,560
(Spanish)

1127
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,640
You're an insane person.
You know that, right?

1128
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,000
(Spanish)

1129
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:34,040
(Spanish)

1130
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:38,320
(Spanish)

1131
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:55,240
<i>Given the debate and confusion
around the word "love" generally</i>

1132
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,440
<i>what are we to make
of the word "love"</i>

1133
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,400
<i>in the context of dancing?</i>

1134
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,720
<i>If you love dancing with someone</i>

1135
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:04,200
<i>does that mean on some level
that you love them?</i>

1136
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:07,400
<i>What other feelings are
exchanged during a dance?</i>

1137
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:09,760
<i>Can you dance
with someone you don't trust?</i>

1138
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,800
<i>Should you trust someone
just because they can dance?</i>

1139
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:15,320
<i>Max and Mike weren't
thinking about this</i>

1140
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:16,600
<i>but they should have been.</i>

1141
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:17,800
Stop the music!

1142
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:20,600
Stop the music! Stop the music.

1143
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:22,960
- Edna?
- Edna?

1144
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,840
I am so sorry, Ms. Mendoza.

1145
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:28,880
I'm so deeply sorry to each and
every one of you beautiful creatures.

1146
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,120
Sorry for what?

1147
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:31,880
Height restrictions for stage risers.

1148
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:35,040
Apparently, your new stage is
three quarters of an inch too high.

1149
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:36,520
Your exemption has been denied.

1150
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,920
You're to shut down immediately.

1151
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,760
But you had already approved it!

1152
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:43,880
I got a call
from an MP's office. It's law.

1153
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,120
There's nothing I can do.

1154
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:49,280
Keep working.

1155
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,416
I'll take care of this.
I'll be right back.

1156
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:52,440
Okay.

1157
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:08,760
How fucking dare you?

1158
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,480
You're not shutting me down again.

1159
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:11,600
Not this time.

1160
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,320
Max, I sincerely want
to rebuild our trust.

1161
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:17,160
In the meantime, I'm just trying
to look out for you.

1162
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,800
How is shutting down my show
looking out for me?

1163
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,240
I'm not talking about the show.

1164
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:22,376
Then what are you talking about?

1165
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,120
I'm talking about your judgment.

1166
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,240
I'm talking
what I witnessed in the kitchen

1167
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:27,560
in front of our daughter.

1168
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:31,880
Roger, I wouldn't get into a dispute
about judgment with me right now.

1169
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:35,360
You handed my family's theater
over to a fucking stripper.

1170
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:38,760
You don't know anything about Mike.

1171
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:42,320
I know when you're being used.
Don't you see that?

1172
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
No.

1173
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,960
Darling, I know we're all getting old

1174
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,400
but I didn't know
you were so desperate.

1175
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:53,520
Fuck you! We care for each other.

1176
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,560
Max, have you even read
our settlement agreement?

1177
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,760
The language about denigrating
or harming the family brand?

1178
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,800
The moment that show goes up

1179
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:05,400
mother's barristers will be clawing
back every last shilling in court

1180
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:07,160
and I won't be able to stop her.

1181
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:10,240
But if you're still too deluded
to help yourself

1182
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:12,560
please be mindful of Zadie.

1183
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:15,960
She shouldn't have to pay
the price for your fantasies.

1184
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,720
Would you please stop it?

1185
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:23,800
What?

1186
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,120
I know what you're thinking.

1187
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,000
You're thinking,
"What was she thinking?"

1188
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:29,880
You weren't thinking, were you?

1189
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,040
You were falling in love.

1190
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,440
Oh, shut the fuck up.

1191
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:34,040
You think I don't know that?

1192
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:36,400
And don't you dare judge me.
You were not there.

1193
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,840
That one fucking dance...

1194
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,560
changed everything in me.

1195
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:48,400
It feels like it made me
the best version of myself

1196
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:51,560
but everybody's laughing at me.
I'm a joke. An embarrassment.

1197
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:54,920
Not to him though.

1198
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,480
He believes in me.

1199
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,480
And I have to go tell him

1200
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:03,600
that our show about
empowering women is dead

1201
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:05,920
because I'm so fucking powerless.

1202
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:10,360
The most frightening part is that

1203
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,720
I'm about to find out

1204
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:15,560
if that dance meant
as much to him as it did to me.

1205
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:21,120
Or if I'm just
another goddamn Tuesday.

1206
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,240
No, you're more like
a Thursday, madame.

1207
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,880
Have I always been this adolescent?

1208
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,320
No.

1209
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,400
Only when it's raining.

1210
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:37,280
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

1211
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,400
One.

1212
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:39,680
Mike.

1213
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,640
Jack, keep taking them through.

1214
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,760
What the fuck you mean "we're done"?

1215
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:54,080
I'm sorry. I did my best,
but I failed.

1216
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,576
- Wait. What... All right.
- Victor will come back

1217
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:57,600
and pick you up

1218
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,600
and he can arrange
a flight for you tomorrow.

1219
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:01,600
No, no, no. What happened?
This isn't you.

1220
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:03,320
What the fuck
is going on with you, Max?

1221
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:08,800
Nothing.

1222
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:10,080
What?

1223
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:11,440
Un-fucking-believable.

1224
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,520
You really are the Queen of
the First Act, huh? Holy shit.

1225
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:20,120
You don't know anything about me.
And you don't understand anything.

1226
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,680
It's Friday.

1227
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:24,200
They wouldn't pull the plug
on us until Monday.

1228
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:25,880
But you're walking away.

1229
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:27,800
You have no show.

1230
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,480
You couldn't even come up
with an ending.

1231
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:33,520
You cannot say that what we've
created so far isn't fucking special.

1232
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,680
You cannot say that.
I know you can't.

1233
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:43,760
I'm sorry, but
we're gonna have to let it go.

1234
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:47,760
You'll still get paid.

1235
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:50,560
Hey! Hey, look, I don't
give a fuck about the money.

1236
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,360
I don't fucking care.

1237
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,040
Okay?

1238
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:57,720
We're good at this and I'm not gonna
fucking just let us give up on it.

1239
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,400
You're so good at this.

1240
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:05,760
I bet you he never cared about
what you were good at. Did he?

1241
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,160
Don't let this be the end.

1242
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:58,120
- Woody!
- Lay it on me, gov.

1243
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,880
I need a plumber and a ballerina.

1244
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,120
The princess is on a hunger strike.

1245
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:05,880
Won't even open the door.

1246
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:07,400
What? She's not even drinking?

1247
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:08,560
I'm afraid not.

1248
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:11,360
Did you try using
your "wise British butler" voice?

1249
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:15,800
Trust me, I went full metal
<i>Downton Abbey</i> on her ass.

1250
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:19,360
And if that bloke doesn't
pull his head from his own ass

1251
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,480
you'll be parented
from behind a closed door

1252
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:23,040
for months. Years, even.

1253
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:26,280
But you didn't tell her
you slipped Mike the keys?

1254
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:27,800
Please.

1255
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:29,320
If the lawyers found out

1256
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:32,160
her careless manservant
failed to lock the Rattigan doors,

1257
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:34,160
she'll need plausible deniability.

1258
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:35,880
If there's anything I've learned

1259
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,960
it's that you can't tell
people anything.

1260
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,720
They have to have an experience.

1261
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,640
Message from Mike.

1262
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:46,440
"End is not ending.

1263
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:49,080
"Sunday at seven we roll.
The Grand Finale."

1264
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:50,200
Let me see that.

1265
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,880
Crikey, it's a haiku.

1266
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:57,200
Seventeen syllables
in a five-seven-five pattern.

1267
01:14:58,200 --> 01:14:59,920
Purely coincidence, but still...

1268
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,160
there's hope for him after all.

1269
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,960
Sounds like
Sunday's gonna be an experience.

1270
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,200
Doesn't it just?

1271
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,640
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1272
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:53,400
Follow me.

1273
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,480
Put some clothes on, Maxandra.

1274
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,000
Why would I do that?

1275
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,360
We have to go.

1276
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:15,680
Where?

1277
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,120
You know where.

1278
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:23,760
- He didn't.
- He did.

1279
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:24,880
No, he didn't.

1280
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,200
Oh, my God.

1281
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:30,440
Oh, my God. No.
No, it's gonna be a disaster.

1282
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:31,520
No, it's not.

1283
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,120
Oh, it's going to be a disaster.

1284
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,040
No, no, no. I can't. I can't. No.

1285
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,376
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't go.

1286
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,400
Come on.

1287
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:39,040
No, I won't go
and you can't make me.

1288
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:40,680
Mom.

1289
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:43,800
We have to go.

1290
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,600
Here you go. There.

1291
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:11,960
Victor.

1292
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:18,360
<i>The rumors about the show were
a form of entertainment for some.</i>

1293
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:20,880
<i>But for the two people who created it</i>

1294
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:24,360
<i>the terror of the opening night
could only be managed</i>

1295
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:26,720
<i>by remembering
there would be no record of it.</i>

1296
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:30,080
<i>Only the people who were there
would ever experience</i>

1297
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:33,640
<i>the story of Max and Mike
as told through dance.</i>

1298
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,296
There's small ships,
there's tall ships

1299
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:36,680
there're ships that sail the sea

1300
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,440
there's no ships like friendships

1301
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:39,600
so here's to you and me.

1302
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:40,760
One, two, three.

1303
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:42,240
Let's go.

1304
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,680
We are strippers!

1305
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,200
All right, man.

1306
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:03,520
- Let's go.
- Yes.

1307
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:06,680
Break a leg, everyone.
Alex, cue one and sound. Go.

1308
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:19,240
The light is different.

1309
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,080
It's November. It's lower.

1310
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,160
Harold's worried about lunch.

1311
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:29,800
He said the menu is diabolical.

1312
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:31,800
The menu is diabolical?

1313
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:33,760
How can a menu be diabolical?

1314
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,800
Only a person can be diabolical.

1315
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:37,200
A menu isn't alive.

1316
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:39,000
Well, either way, he's worried.

1317
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:40,320
And you're worried about him?

1318
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:41,560
I don't envy him finding out.

1319
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,920
- Well, I'll tell him.
- Isabel, no. It's impossible.

1320
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,880
- He has to know.
- He can never know.

1321
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,200
Harold.

1322
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:50,200
Hello, darling.

1323
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Walter.

1324
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:54,160
Drinks?

1325
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:55,760
Will you still be going to Calais?

1326
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:58,760
No. I've decided
to spend the summer here.

1327
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:01,560
You see, Isabel is pregnant.

1328
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,880
Oh. Congratulations.

1329
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:06,000
Yes. We are very pleased.

1330
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,640
We are hoping
to have a son, of course.

1331
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:12,320
That way the legacy of Chuffingham
will be secure.

1332
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,240
And if not, we will keep trying.

1333
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:18,600
One of the benefits
of having a young wife.

1334
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,240
I'm sure Isabel will
make a wonderful mother.

1335
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:22,320
No doubt.

1336
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,920
And of course my mother

1337
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:26,520
will be here to help.

1338
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:28,600
Unicorn! Unicorn! Unicorn!

1339
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:38,760
Hello, Lady Isabel.

1340
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:40,240
Unicorn?

1341
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:44,640
Why, yes, it's me, Unicorn.
Did you call for me?

1342
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:48,320
Yeah, but I didn't expect you
to show up out of the blue.

1343
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:49,896
I haven't spoken
to my imaginary friend

1344
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,960
since I was a child.

1345
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,000
Am I okay?

1346
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:57,760
Well, that depends on
what your definition of okay is, but

1347
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,400
first things first

1348
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,600
why don't you tell us
how you really feel.

1349
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,320
Well...

1350
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,120
I don't know.

1351
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:24,880
These two guys shouldn't be
my only two options in the world

1352
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,040
should they?

1353
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:27,600
I mean

1354
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,520
why do I need to feel like I choose?

1355
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,320
Like, it's between
the shitty rich guy

1356
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:34,880
and the poor guy
with a heart of gold.

1357
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:36,320
I mean, come on

1358
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:41,240
all I really want right now is
to tell these boring bags of dicks

1359
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:43,680
to leave me alone!

1360
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:47,640
That's right, Lady Isabel.

1361
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,320
See, I'm here to tell you that
you can have anything you want.

1362
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:53,880
All you have to do is ask.

1363
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,320
What?

1364
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,920
Okay. Really?

1365
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:00,520
- Really.
- Okay.

1366
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:05,360
Well, I am a modest lady, so...

1367
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:11,160
what if all I wanted was just a guy
in a tank top and some jeans?

1368
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:18,040
Okay, well

1369
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,520
if I can have that then

1370
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:22,240
what about a bad boy...

1371
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:23,560
Hold up, hold up

1372
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,440
Who always responds to my texts.

1373
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,760
All right.

1374
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:35,200
And now,
if I can have that then...

1375
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:40,320
a sexy CEO who pays his women
more than his men!

1376
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:43,920
Ooh, me-ow.

1377
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,120
What about a guy with a puppy?

1378
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,800
Okay, let me just swallow my saliva

1379
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:55,920
that's literally dripping out
of my mouth right now.

1380
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,680
If I could have all of that,
why stop there?

1381
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:10,320
Wait a minute.

1382
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,800
I can't be the only person
in this room

1383
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:15,520
to feel what I'm feeling
right now. Am I?

1384
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:16,960
No!

1385
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,040
I didn't think so.

1386
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:20,120
I can tell by the looks
on your faces.

1387
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:23,920
Now I want every single one
of you to know

1388
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,000
how I'm feeling
right this very second.

1389
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,880
I managed to have
a little bit of everything.

1390
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,880
And now, it's your turn.

1391
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:37,120
So, by the power vested in me
through this Magic Mike

1392
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:42,160
I command thee, Unicorn,
send everything to us all

1393
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:44,320
right now!

1394
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,200
Hey!

1395
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:33,920
<i>Single ladies! I can't hear ya!</i>

1396
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,400
<i>Single ladies! Make noise!</i>

1397
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,800
<i>What's your zodiac sign?</i>

1398
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,200
<i>What's your zodiac sign?</i>

1399
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:43,560
<i>What's your zodiac sign?</i>

1400
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:14,600
How do you feel about
your new reality, everybody?

1401
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:17,520
Make some bloody noise.

1402
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:23,440
Give it up. Give it up
for these gorgeous lads

1403
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:26,640
who busted into a sweat
just for all of you.

1404
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:28,640
Come on, make a little noise.

1405
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:32,640
Yeah... yeah.

1406
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:36,800
That's what I like to hear.
That's what I love to hear.

1407
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:40,480
A little bit of noise on this stage
doesn't go amiss, sweethearts.

1408
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:42,200
And let me tell you one thing

1409
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:44,160
a body at rest...

1410
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:46,680
is a body at rest. Right?

1411
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,560
Eh, you know, not bad.

1412
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:50,680
But a body in motion...

1413
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:58,480
There is absolutely nothing sexier

1414
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:01,560
than a body in motion. Am I right?

1415
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:07,240
So for our next act

1416
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:09,600
I want you to give it up,
ladies and gentlemen

1417
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:13,120
for the trickster prince
him bloody self.

1418
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:18,520
Give it up, everybody,
for Mr. JD Rainey.

1419
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:56,280
I think we should leave now.

1420
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:57,360
Where are we going?

1421
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:58,856
Mike said to leave
at the end of Suits

1422
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,160
and return at the end of Pony.

1423
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:01,560
Oh, yes, yes. So you go.

1424
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:03,200
And no peeking.

1425
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:05,160
He'll be watching you.

1426
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:09,000
Now folks, this next dance

1427
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:11,240
is one that I'm well-acquainted with.

1428
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:15,800
Things are about to get intimate.

1429
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:22,360
Now, a real man isn't afraid
to act on his desire...

1430
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:25,920
but the sexiest act of submission...

1431
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:29,480
is asking for permission.

1432
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:19,760
Break a leg, gov.

1433
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:21,280
Aw, bless ya.

1434
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:38,120
I know. I know.

1435
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,600
We all want
a little bit of everything

1436
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:42,520
all of the time. Don't we?

1437
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:43,720
But...

1438
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:45,320
sometimes...

1439
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:50,800
you just want to be
everything to someone. Right?

1440
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:54,040
Sometimes...

1441
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:57,000
the greatest fantasy of them all...

1442
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:59,600
is knowing that you're the only one.

1443
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:10,880
You said to go hard,
and so I did what you said.

1444
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:12,240
I mean, you know.

1445
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:13,640
- Oh, God.
- We showed up.

1446
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:21,320
That's Pony.

1447
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:22,520
Mike said after Pony.

1448
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:24,200
No, he just said Pony.

1449
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:26,120
He definitely said after Pony

1450
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:28,200
and they're still
on their ponies. Now sit.

1451
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:18,440
Yes!

1452
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,920
Come on, they're applauding.
It must be over now.

1453
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:31,400
Very well.

1454
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:49,760
So amazing.

1455
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:57,040
Wait a minute. Just a second.

1456
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:58,840
Thank you very much, Mr. Mike.

1457
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:00,160
Very nice, my friend.

1458
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:19,800
- You look beautiful.
- Congratulations.

1459
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:21,600
- Huh?
- Congratulations.

1460
01:41:21,680 --> 01:41:23,056
- You did it.
- What are you talking about?

1461
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:24,856
- We did it. Look around.
- You did it. It was amazing.

1462
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:26,656
- All this is because of you.
- You are sublime.

1463
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:28,520
Look, I just want you to know
I love you. Okay?

1464
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:36,920
Wait... wait.
If you're not gonna leave him

1465
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,760
I don't want this
to be more confusing.

1466
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:40,880
It's done.

1467
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:44,200
I'm never, ever, ever
going back to him.

1468
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:46,880
I am free and I am broke.

1469
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:50,400
What do you mean? You're...
What do you mean you're broke?

1470
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:52,760
- Yeah.
- Like broke, broke?

1471
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:55,680
I'm s... I'm sorry.

1472
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:57,520
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay. I don't care.

1473
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:01,320
No, I'm... I'm just...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1474
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:10,960
I hate you.

1475
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:19,040
Come on, let's go.

1476
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:27,760
<i>No one can claim to fully understand
what exactly dance is</i>

1477
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:29,760
<i>but what is abundantly clear</i>

1478
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:33,040
<i>is that dance seeks
no meaning for its desires.</i>

1479
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:37,480
<i>It does not value age
or status, logic or reason.</i>

1480
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:40,800
<i>It is a compass orientated
only to liberty</i>

1481
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:43,000
<i>not unlike the human heart.</i>

1482
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:45,080
<i>I stumbled upon these wisdoms</i>

1483
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:48,160
<i>when I met a lonely stripper
named Mike.</i>
