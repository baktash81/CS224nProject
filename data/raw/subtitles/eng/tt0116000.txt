It's a great honor to be here today...

to introduce you
to a truly great group of kids.

Sure, they can be
a little rambunctious.

They've run me ragged and played
more than their fair share of pranks.

I still haven't forgotten
about those eggs.

But I hung in there,
and they hung in there for me.

these are good people.

enliven your school and your

for punching out his own coach.
