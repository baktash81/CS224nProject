1
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:33,249
I first tasted semen when
I was seven years old.

2
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:40,374
Nothing to say?

3
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:44,957
It's certainly a
startling opening line.

4
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,707
What is that, irony?

5
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:51,749
I'm sorry. Let's start again.

6
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,665
What do you want to say to me?

7
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:04,790
I'm here to listen to
whatever you have to say.

8
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,999
I was raped by a priest
when I was seven years old.

9
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:13,499
Orally and anally as they
say in the court reports.

10
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:19,915
This went on for five years;
every other day for five years.

11
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:27,474
I bled a lot, as you can imagine
I bled a terrible amount.

12
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:36,207
- Have you spoken to anyone about this?
- I'm speaking to you, now!

13
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:40,332
I mean, have you sought
professional help?

14
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:44,540
Why? So I could learn how to cope? So
that I could learn how to live with it?

15
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:49,457
Maybe I don't want to cope. Maybe I don't
want to learn how to live with it.

16
00:02:56,083 --> 00:03:00,249
Did you make a formal complaint?
Did you testify?

17
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,665
The man's dead.

18
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,624
I don't know what to say to you.

19
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:15,040
I have no answer for
you, I'm sorry.

20
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:19,665
What good would it do anyway
if he were still alive?

21
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,874
What would be the point
of killing the bastard?

22
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,374
That would be no news. There's no
point in killing a bad priest.

23
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:33,082
Killing a good one?
That would be a shock!

24
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,207
They wouldn't know
what to make of that.

25
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:40,165
I'm going to kill you, Father.

26
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:43,390
I'm going to kill you 'cause
you've done nothing wrong!

27
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:46,832
I'm going to kill you
because you're innocent.

28
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,665
Not right now, though.

29
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,582
I'll give you enough time
to put your house in order.

30
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,207
Make your peace with God.

31
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,915
Sunday week, let's say.

32
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:08,290
I'll meet you down by the
beach, down by the water there.

33
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:17,665
Killing a priest on a Sunday!
That'll be a good one.

34
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,874
Nothing to say to me, Father?

35
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:30,624
Not right now, no. But I'm sure I'll
think of something by Sunday week.

36
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,457
- Body of Christ.
- Amen.

37
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,387
A little too much
wine again, Mícheál?

38
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,265
Sorry, Father.

39
00:06:07,475 --> 00:06:10,682
I'm wondering is this some
kind of ploy on your behalf.

40
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,040
Ploy, Father?

41
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:17,082
I've noticed my stocks of booze appear
to be... somewhat diminished of late.

42
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,243
I'm wondering is this some
kind of ploy you're working?

43
00:06:20,268 --> 00:06:23,368
Cover up for the wine you've
been imbibing on the Q.T.

44
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:27,999
I've no idea what you're talking about.
Father Leary noticed nothing amiss.

45
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:31,090
Father Leary does not know you
as well as I do, Mícheál.

46
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,890
He may well underestimate the depths
of your Machiavellian chicanery.

47
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,374
Can I go now, Father?

48
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:41,290
What's the hurry? Have they called
a meeting at Mafia Headquarters?

49
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,707
On your way!

50
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:58,540
Things you hear in
confession these days!

51
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:02,707
- It's depressing.
- You have to detach yourself from it.

52
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,932
We're here to provide solace. Your
personal feelings don't come into it.

53
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,707
I know that! What
do you take me for?

54
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,057
It's difficult, though. The mess
people make of their lives.

55
00:07:15,325 --> 00:07:18,582
What's the problem? Without
going into details, obviously.

56
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,274
That woman with the big black
eye, have you seen her?

57
00:07:21,283 --> 00:07:23,999
- Veronica Brennan. Yeah.
- She's an odd one.

58
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:28,999
Things she comes up with. Think she's
trying to drag you down into the muck.

59
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:31,215
Do you know what "felching" is?

60
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:33,115
I do know what
"felching" is, yeah.

61
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:37,740
- I had to look it up.
- This is you not going into details?

62
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,499
Sorry. Anyway, whatever is wrong with
her has obviously gotten out of hand.

63
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,457
She's got knocked around now.

64
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,007
Well if you say it to her
she'll raise holy hell.

65
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:50,357
Say it on the basis of something
she said during confession.

66
00:07:50,525 --> 00:07:52,665
I know, I know, we
can't have that.

67
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,540
She could be
excommunicated, the cow.

68
00:07:56,958 --> 00:08:01,915
I'll have a word with her. Jack as well.
Pastoral duties and what have you.

69
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:05,965
Nothing to do with her confession.
See what's going on.

70
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:12,040
That colored fellow, the... Ugandan.
He's one of her lovers, I think.

71
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,082
Simon's from the Ivory Coast.

72
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:20,374
Right. I knew it was that or Guyana
or one of those African countries.

73
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,624
Guyana is in South America.

74
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:29,665
Don't think so, Father. I was
always pretty good at Geography.

75
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,915
Not bad!

76
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,374
Surprisingly.

77
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:01,624
I was expecting a daub.

78
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,624
Who are these two lads?

79
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,665
Don't know. I'm reading
these ghost stories.

80
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,071
Maybe it's got something
to do with that.

81
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:15,596
Spooky.

82
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,165
So, did you know who it was?

83
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,415
Yes, I know who it was.

84
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,790
Do you know him well?

85
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,249
Well enough.

86
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:12,124
Knowing this man as you do... Do
you think it was an idle threat?

87
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,082
I don't know. I'm not sure.

88
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:18,290
If you're not sure, it
means it's possible.

89
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,540
Yes, I suppose.

90
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,082
You didn't grant him
absolution, obviously?

91
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,915
He didn't ask for it.

92
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,940
There you have it. The man is not penitent.
There's no contrition.

93
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:39,549
He's threatening to commit a crime,
not asking for forgiveness for one.

94
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:43,332
The inviolability of the
sacramental seal does not apply.

95
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,082
You're saying I should
go to the police?

96
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,790
I'm not saying anything, James.

97
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,624
The choice is yours.

98
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:14,999
Don't tell me, you made
the classic error.

99
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:19,165
You're supposed to cut
down, not across.

100
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,207
This is Bruno.

101
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:34,290
And I always wanted a
fast car, a red one.

102
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:37,165
I thought you'd already
had your midlife crisis?

103
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,332
You're a very
nice-looking young woman.

104
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:07,760
Thank you.

105
00:12:08,553 --> 00:12:10,087
I like your bow tie.

106
00:12:11,074 --> 00:12:12,502
It's got polka dots.

107
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,082
This is my daughter Fiona, Milo.
She's over from London.

108
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,957
- You're having me on.
- I'm not having you on.

109
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:23,790
- But you're a priest. - I was
married before I became a priest.

110
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,664
My wife and I had a child
- Fiona. My wife died...

111
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:29,089
and after that I
joined the priesthood.

112
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:35,165
- You can do that, can you?
- It would appear so.

113
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:38,999
Don't tell me. You made
the classic error.

114
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,290
- I've already done that guide, Frank
- You're supposed to cut down.

115
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,915
- I said I've already done it!
- Now, now!

116
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,032
Drop of the hard
stuff for yourself.

117
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:52,632
A generous serving of the old water of
life for this beautiful, yet troubled...

118
00:12:52,741 --> 00:12:54,665
Fuck off!

119
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:58,540
An exceedingly dotty mouth.
I like that in a whore.

120
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,665
Brendan, now's not the time.

121
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:06,749
Whatever you say, Father.
You're the boss.

122
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,665
How's that working out for you?

123
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:15,040
- I haven't been out in a good while.
- So you say.

124
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:19,082
No, no. I've been a very good lad.
And don't change the subject.

125
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,165
What was the subject?

126
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:26,182
- You know what the subject was.
- Oh, daddy, a man. A man, what else?

127
00:13:26,225 --> 00:13:28,290
It's getting to be
a habit, honey.

128
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:32,624
I know. It's pathetic, I
can't do anything right.

129
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,582
Nice shades.

130
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,749
Do they make me
look like Jackie O?

131
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,915
Not really.

132
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:28,874
This what you came to go about?
Nasty, huh?

133
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,707
Interesting color.

134
00:14:30,716 --> 00:14:34,490
They say you can find beauty in
everything, if you look hard enough.

135
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,665
And I'd say you can find
beauty in most things.

136
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:41,082
Not everything. That's nonsense.

137
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:44,707
What would I know? I'm
just an old washer woman.

138
00:14:44,816 --> 00:14:47,749
Listen, if you don't want
to talk to me, that's fine.

139
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,090
I'm not here to compel
you to do anything.

140
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,824
You never know, Father. Maybe I'd like
to be compelled. Maybe I'd enjoy it.

141
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,332
I'll have a word with Jack. See
what he has to say for himself.

142
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:04,207
Grand Inquisitor? Go
and hear for yourself.

143
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,665
I'm sure he'll be only too pleased to
have someone else to bore the ears off.

144
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:10,415
I stopped listening to his
old shite a long time ago.

145
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,832
That's how it is, is it? I'm
sorry, I didn't realize.

146
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:17,665
You thought we were another
Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier?

147
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,690
I know it wasn't a very happy marriage.
So it's not a great analogy.

148
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,832
You know that's what I've
always liked about you, Father.

149
00:15:26,857 --> 00:15:29,457
You're just a little too
sharp for this parish.

150
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:34,624
Fine fellow he was. Decapitated the two
of them. Blood all over the place.

151
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,040
- Hi, Father.
- Jack.

152
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:43,332
Could I have a word? In private.

153
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,415
Sounds ominous.

154
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,832
Where's Johnnie Cochran
when you need him?

155
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:59,999
I hope we don't get locked in here.
We'd have to make love to keep warm.

156
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,874
I had a word with
Veronica, Jack.

157
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,915
Out at the house, are you?
Is everything all right?

158
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:13,082
Everything's fine. I mean
now, everything's not fine.

159
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,082
Mass on Sunday? With the
shades and everything.

160
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,249
- Oh, that.
- Yes, that.

161
00:16:19,258 --> 00:16:21,474
Are you laying into her
or what's going on?

162
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:25,490
I wasn't mean to her. No. That's that
black fellow that she's been seeing.

163
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:27,707
I mean that colored
fellow she's been seeing.

164
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,257
I didn't mean to be racist,
that was a slip of the tongue.

165
00:16:30,266 --> 00:16:34,665
- You're saying he beat her up?
- That's what I'm assuming. Yeah.

166
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:40,249
The way she speaks in riddles. I
can't make any sense out of her.

167
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,774
I think she's bipolar. Or lactose
intolerant. One of the two.

168
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:47,749
I don't know where I am
with her anymore, Father.

169
00:16:47,816 --> 00:16:51,432
And if I'm honest with you, I'm kind
of glad to have her off my hands.

170
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,499
Even if this fellow is
knocking her about?

171
00:16:53,508 --> 00:16:55,274
What's it to do with me!

172
00:16:55,316 --> 00:16:56,749
What?

173
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,915
Not everyone can carry
the weight of the world!

174
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:03,940
- What about your marriage? The
oaths you took? - The oaths I took!

175
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,874
Listen...

176
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:12,582
She's happier, now that she's seeing him.
A lot more settled down.

177
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,940
Like a lot calmer. And I'm not
under surveillance anymore.

178
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:18,765
I can just reel in at
whatever time I like.

179
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:22,964
So everybody's happy!
Where's the harm in that?

180
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,707
Shall I cut you a side
of beef to take home?

181
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,957
It's freshly slaughtered.

182
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,099
- Simon.
- Hello, Father.

183
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,540
Why the visit today?

184
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,790
It's not about my car.

185
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:47,407
It's about Mrs. Brennan.
You're her boyfriend.

186
00:17:49,483 --> 00:17:53,165
I fuck her from time to time.
Does that make me her boyfriend?

187
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:57,707
- Does around here. - She has a
lot of boyfriends, I've heard.

188
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,124
How many?

189
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:03,707
You want me to confess to adultery?
Is that why you're here?

190
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,974
Somebody beat her up.

191
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,540
- Did she tell you I beat her up?
- No, she didn't.

192
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,790
Then why are you here?

193
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,415
Somebody beat her up.

194
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,040
It's either you or the husband.

195
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:19,207
I don't think Jack would beat her up.
He's not the type.

196
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,457
What is the type?

197
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,915
- Some of them like to be hit, you know?
- Who?

198
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,824
White women, Irish women.
Do not ask me why.

199
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:33,835
- You'd have to be a psychiatrist.
- That's nonsense.

200
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:34,790
No, no.

201
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,624
They like to be hit.

202
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,790
In certain situations,
they beg for it in fact.

203
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,415
So she got what was
coming for her, did she?

204
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:47,457
- I was speaking generally.
- Oh, you were speaking generally.

205
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:50,624
Well, I'm speaking specifically.

206
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:54,215
- Don't do it again.
- You cannot tell me what to do!

207
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,499
- We're not in the missions now.
- Oh, the missions! Right.

208
00:18:57,566 --> 00:19:00,049
Are you going to chop off
my hand if I disobey you?

209
00:19:00,116 --> 00:19:01,982
You know your history.
That's grand.

210
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,165
I like to read.

211
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,674
You probably think
that black people...

212
00:19:05,841 --> 00:19:09,499
Yeah, yeah. Black people, white people.
Blah, blah, blah.

213
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:15,749
Run along now, Father.
Your sermon is finished.

214
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,449
Better watch your step there.

215
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:22,957
Why is that?

216
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:27,457
If he was him who was laying into her,
you have to tread very carefully there.

217
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,999
It's a very sensitive area.

218
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:35,332
You'll have to explain this to me. I'm
afraid you've lost me completely.

219
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:41,207
The Church can't be seen to be getting
involved in matters of diversity.

220
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,132
Do you know?

221
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:47,290
You mean if he's beating her up as one
of those ethnic rituals or something?

222
00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:50,140
Like when they do that thing
when they shake hands!

223
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,457
You're mocking me
now, I can tell!

224
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,082
We have to be very circumspect in
those areas. That's all I'm saying.

225
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:01,799
I'll be very circumspect, Father.
Don't you worry about that.

226
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,749
How's all?

227
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,249
At death's door. You?

228
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:33,957
Same. Still using the old typewriter,
I see. You have an affectation?

229
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,949
My whole life has
been an affectation.

230
00:20:37,116 --> 00:20:41,532
One of those lines that sounds witty
and doesn't actually make much sense.

231
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,665
Caught out again.

232
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,040
How's the latest
masterpiece going?

233
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:49,915
Better than "Cecilia Hearn" but
not as good as "Beffield".

234
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,999
Wish I could say that
about everybody.

235
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,665
What have you got for me?

236
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,707
Need anything else?

237
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,224
- A gun.
- Yeah?

238
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:15,457
A Walther PPK.

239
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:20,999
Bond's weapon of choice. Old Adolph
killed himself with one in the bunker.

240
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,540
That's the plan, is it?

241
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:26,915
No intention of riding around in agony
for hours on end when the time comes.

242
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,210
Not knowing who I
am or where I am.

243
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,832
It's nonsense.

244
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,207
Pragmatism.

245
00:21:34,366 --> 00:21:36,165
Where would I get a gun from?

246
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,124
Come on, now. Give me a break.

247
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:41,415
You've never been short of guns
in this country, have you?

248
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:46,374
You're awfully mournful
today, I must say.

249
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:04,582
You don't have any photographs.

250
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,290
No.

251
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,124
I'm in agreement with the
Apaches on that score.

252
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:13,624
The Apaches?

253
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,957
The Apaches. The Arapaho.

254
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:19,490
The Hunk papa Sioux.

255
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,749
Not even one of Mum?

256
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:34,457
Don't need a photograph
to remember your mother.

257
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:43,749
Memories fade. That's what's
so terrible about them.

258
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:49,249
No, they don't.

259
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:51,499
Not really.

260
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,082
I should buy a cane.

261
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,582
It'd suit you. You're
old beyond your years.

262
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:02,874
Yeah.

263
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:05,707
Give me a feeling
of imperiousness.

264
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:10,832
- And you could lean on it.
- I could lean on it! Reflectively.

265
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,457
Point things out.

266
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:15,624
Club someone to death with it.

267
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:19,332
A blunt instrument, yeah.
Who, though?

268
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:23,415
That young man from Dublin.

269
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,207
Are all instruments blunt?

270
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:32,624
Flutes and horns?

271
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,790
Who's this now?

272
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,665
It's my daughter, Fiona.

273
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:46,915
Right! Like a French novel or something.
What was the fellow's name? Bernanos.

274
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:51,374
Michael Fitzgerald. I've bought
the big house up the road.

275
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:54,790
- Haven't seen you at mass recently.
- I've been too busy.

276
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,832
Thinking of getting a chapel built on
the grounds. Like Brideshead Revisited.

277
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:02,124
Then you could pop in freelance
and save me the trouble.

278
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:07,332
- Lovely creature.
- Really expensive too. Prime horsemeat.

279
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:10,349
- Interesting man, your father.
- Is that right?

280
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:14,582
A good man. A fine man. Nobody around
here has a bad word to say about him.

281
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:18,249
- Makes you wonder what he's hiding.
- God, you're a fucking prick!

282
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,874
- Oh, feisty!
- Fiona...

283
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,332
I'm kidding. No offence
meant, as they say.

284
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:27,290
Do me a favor, Father. Swing by the house
one afternoon. I've a proposition.

285
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:29,249
- Really?
- Yes, really.

286
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:32,374
A financial proposition. That
interests you, doesn't it?

287
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:36,790
It would be a black day when the Church
is no longer interested in money.

288
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,540
Huh?

289
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:42,915
Inspector Stanton.

290
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:47,790
The clergy at this time of the night. We
could be getting off to a wild start.

291
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:53,207
Well, hey Father! What do you hear?
What do you say?

292
00:24:53,316 --> 00:24:55,582
I'm sorry, I didn't
realize you had company.

293
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:59,290
Sure. It's only Little Leo.

294
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,040
Are you checking out
my ass, Father?

295
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,582
Huh? No.

296
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:10,165
He's only messing with you, Father.
What can I do for you?

297
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:14,290
There's nothing to hide from Leo.
Right, Leo?

298
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:18,082
He likes an open book, Jerry.
Like your ass.

299
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:22,082
Is this a police matter, Father?

300
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,332
No, it's a personal...
a personal thing.

301
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:28,290
It's a personal...
personal thing.

302
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:32,124
You look worried, Father. My
advice: take it on the lamster.

303
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:35,007
You don't want to drop in
for the phonus bolonus...

304
00:25:35,032 --> 00:25:37,332
and wind up with a shock
in the kisser. Get me?

305
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:41,540
- He's not in the mood, Leo.
- Maybe I can cheer up the old sourpuss.

306
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:45,707
I'll show you a good time, Father.
Good Time Leo, that's me.

307
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:48,249
Although it will be extra if
I let you wear that cassock.

308
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:52,824
I know what you holy rollers are like
when you're getting golden hairs.

309
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:57,965
I'm out of here.

310
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:08,707
He's a character, huh?

311
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:12,749
What's troubling you, Father?
You seem agitated.

312
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:15,415
I need a favor.

313
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:17,582
My great grandfather's.

314
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:21,132
Said he took it off one
of the Cairo Gang...

315
00:26:21,157 --> 00:26:23,357
when he shot them all
on Bloody Sunday.

316
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,990
The first Bloody
Sunday, obviously.

317
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:33,290
- Ever had call to use it?
- Yeah.

318
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:36,815
I killed a man once in
the Wicklow Mountains.

319
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:40,707
What case was that?

320
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,415
Now you're just pissing me off.

321
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:52,540
Somebody been threatening you, Father?
What have you been up to now?

322
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:56,832
If not you, who else?

323
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:05,290
- What did you say you wanted it for?
- I didn't say.

324
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:08,415
I'd say you wanted
it for your dog.

325
00:27:08,541 --> 00:27:11,082
The dog's dying. It's in pain.

326
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:15,165
You're worried you might have to put it
out of its misery one of these days.

327
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,924
My dog's dying. It's in pain.

328
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:20,415
I'm worried I might have to put it
out of its misery one of these days.

329
00:27:20,483 --> 00:27:25,790
Compassionate, huh? Well I can't argue
with that. I'm compassionate myself.

330
00:27:26,066 --> 00:27:28,582
Already had one of those, you know.
Early on.

331
00:27:28,791 --> 00:27:31,124
- One of what?
- Pedophile priest.

332
00:27:31,291 --> 00:27:33,374
Twenty years ago.
This was in Dublin.

333
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:35,832
Young girl made a complaint.
A rape.

334
00:27:35,841 --> 00:27:37,865
- What happened?
- What do you think?

335
00:27:37,975 --> 00:27:39,324
I arrested the bastard,

336
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,665
and 48 hours later I was packing my
bags and making my way out West.

337
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:45,707
- You moved out?
- Reassigned, yeah.

338
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:47,665
What happened to him?

339
00:27:47,675 --> 00:27:51,407
I was told they were sending him to
one of the missions overseas: Africa.

340
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:54,374
He could do whatever he
wanted over there, I suppose.

341
00:27:54,916 --> 00:27:58,082
- Thanks, anyway.
- Like the man says, Father.

342
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,582
Protect yourself!

343
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:54,290
How long have you
been in this crap?

344
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:56,665
A couple of years.

345
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:59,790
Supposed to be therapeutic.

346
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,049
- Maybe I should take it up.
- Maybe you should.

347
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,982
Are you seeing
someone in London?

348
00:29:05,025 --> 00:29:07,207
Do you mean professionally,
rather than...

349
00:29:07,416 --> 00:29:09,249
Let's just stop all this...

350
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:11,974
If you can't talk to me you
should talk to someone.

351
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,765
I suppose I should.

352
00:29:15,908 --> 00:29:17,415
Enjoying yourself?

353
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:20,107
Yeah, we are, yeah.

354
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,865
Lovely day!

355
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:25,165
Yes indeed, yeah.

356
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:27,324
Stamps!

357
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,290
That's the feature
of the priesthood?

358
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:49,832
Milo.

359
00:29:49,941 --> 00:29:51,665
I need to speak to you, Father.

360
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:53,665
Take a pew, literally.

361
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:03,582
Why do people kill
themselves, Father?

362
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:08,540
Why do people kill themselves?
That's jumping in the deep end.

363
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:12,457
Lots of reasons, I suppose.
Why do you think yourself?

364
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:18,349
I don't know. The drink, depression...
Lack of sex, maybe.

365
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:22,165
You're a presentable man. I wouldn't
have thought you'd have trouble there.

366
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:25,124
I don't have the gift of the gab.
Never had it.

367
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:27,249
That's making you feel suicidal?

368
00:30:27,416 --> 00:30:31,665
More bored than anything else. It's
either suicide or joining the army.

369
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:35,749
- Those are drastic choices.
- You can learn a trade if you join.

370
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:37,832
You can learn a
trade if you don't.

371
00:30:37,958 --> 00:30:39,490
You can experience more of life.

372
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,432
You think you can become a more
authentic person by fighting in a war?

373
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,574
By killing people.

374
00:30:44,641 --> 00:30:46,707
You're against me joining
is what I'm sensing.

375
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:48,274
Let's put it this way:

376
00:30:48,383 --> 00:30:51,807
I've always felt there's something
inherently psychopathic...

377
00:30:51,832 --> 00:30:54,332
about someone who joins
the army in peacetime.

378
00:30:54,416 --> 00:30:56,990
As far as I'm concerned
people join the army...

379
00:30:57,015 --> 00:31:00,015
because they want to find out
what it's like to kill someone.

380
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:04,624
I hardly think that's an inclination
that should be encouraged, do you?

381
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:08,957
Jesus Christ didn't
think so either.

382
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,457
And the Commandment "thou
shalt not kill"...

383
00:31:11,482 --> 00:31:14,778
does not have an
asterisk beside it,

384
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:20,415
referring you to the bottom of the page,
with instances where it's OK to kill.

385
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:22,707
What about self-defense?

386
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:28,165
It's a tricky one, all right.

387
00:31:28,241 --> 00:31:30,324
We're hardly being
invaded, though, are we?

388
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:32,457
The war on terror
has no borders.

389
00:31:32,583 --> 00:31:36,957
I don't think we're high on Al
Qaeda's agenda, Milo, do you?

390
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:39,582
Who knows what goes on
in the Muslim mind?

391
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:43,374
I have had murderous feelings,
though, I have to admit.

392
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:48,832
Not getting laid. It's starting to make
me feel really angry towards women.

393
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:51,540
And so I thought, well,
if I join the Army...

394
00:31:51,608 --> 00:31:54,749
those inclinations, as you call
them, would be seen as a plus.

395
00:31:54,916 --> 00:31:58,957
On the application, they don't come out
and say that's what they're looking for.

396
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,649
In the ads they tell about seeing
the world and all that shite.

397
00:32:01,716 --> 00:32:05,607
But I would assume wanting to murder
someone would be like having a degree.

398
00:32:05,775 --> 00:32:09,006
It would outweigh my
lack of qualifications.

399
00:32:09,916 --> 00:32:12,207
Right.

400
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,265
Do you use pornography?

401
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:18,040
I feel I've exhausted all the
possibilities of pornography.

402
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:19,665
All of them?

403
00:32:19,733 --> 00:32:23,124
Nearly all of them. I'm on to
transsexual pornography at the moment.

404
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:25,957
Chicks with dicks, you know?

405
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:31,874
Maybe there's a
simpler solution.

406
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:35,999
Leave home. Go somewhere where your
chances of meeting available women...

407
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:39,540
with loose morals are
increased proportionally.

408
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,749
Should I go to town, you mean?

409
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:47,207
No, I was thinking more
Dublin, London, New York?

410
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:50,982
New York? I might end
up getting the AIDS.

411
00:32:51,075 --> 00:32:54,057
Thanks for taking the time
to talk to me, Father.

412
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:56,140
I can't say it's been much help.

413
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,690
But it's good to get these things
out in the open, I suppose.

414
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,349
Puck!

415
00:33:21,404 --> 00:33:22,464
Puck!

416
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:45,832
They've all left me, you know.
That's why the place is so empty.

417
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:48,624
Like a tomb.

418
00:33:48,791 --> 00:33:50,415
Who's left you?

419
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:52,749
The wife, the kids.

420
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,665
Even Consuela. And
she's from Ecuador.

421
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:59,790
So you'd think she wouldn't have that
many options. But apparently not.

422
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:02,332
Sorry to hear that.

423
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:06,790
You mentioned a
financial proposition.

424
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:12,499
I'd like to make amends.
Do penance for past sins.

425
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:17,957
Although, I suppose all sins are past.
Otherwise they wouldn't be sins.

426
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:23,999
They'd just be... evil thoughts.
Floating around in your mind.

427
00:34:27,041 --> 00:34:29,832
Why do you wear the old
soutane, by the way?

428
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,249
Are you trying to
make a statement?

429
00:34:32,458 --> 00:34:37,365
I mean, look. This watch, here. That's
making a statement. A TAG Heuer.

430
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:41,532
Are you going to get to the point, Mr.
Fitzgerald? Or are you going to ramble?

431
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,790
Let me ask you a question: What
do you see when you look at me?

432
00:34:47,791 --> 00:34:49,665
I'll tell you what you see.

433
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:52,332
You see a handsome,
sophisticated,

434
00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:55,457
eminent man in the
prime of his life.

435
00:34:55,666 --> 00:35:01,207
A colossus, let's say. Who once
bestrode the world of high finance...

436
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:06,663
and became profoundly
influential in certain spheres.

437
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:11,944
I'm not saying inordinately. I'm
saying significantly. Let's face it.

438
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:15,832
Are you sure I can't tempt you?

439
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:17,415
I'll stick to the water.

440
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:19,499
I heard you like to drink.

441
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:21,749
I like it too much.

442
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:24,582
There's no such
thing as too much.

443
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:29,165
There's only not enough!

444
00:35:29,916 --> 00:35:31,707
Where was I?

445
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:33,707
Talking about money, what else?

446
00:35:33,775 --> 00:35:35,082
Now, now.

447
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:38,540
- Got out in time, did you?
- Before it all came crashing down.

448
00:35:38,708 --> 00:35:40,832
It was the perfect
getaway, Father.

449
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,040
They say charges are going to be filed
against me, for various irregularities.

450
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:49,124
But they're always threatening
things like that.

451
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:53,415
They'd have to charge half the
financiers in Ireland. And the bankers.

452
00:35:53,458 --> 00:35:56,207
And then troop into government
and charge those cunts as well.

453
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:58,999
And we all know that's
not going to happen.

454
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:03,915
No, there'll be no punishment
forthcoming for a man such as myself.

455
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:07,040
There never is.

456
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:12,165
Still, I feel a... modicum of
guilt about the whole thing.

457
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:16,290
- A modicum? Do you?
- Well...

458
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:19,124
I feel like I ought
to feel guilty.

459
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:22,957
I'm sure it's not
the same thing.

460
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:26,624
I love this one.
Really expensive.

461
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:30,040
Not quite sure what it's
supposed to mean, though.

462
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:32,040
Why does it have
to mean anything?

463
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:35,499
Everything has to mean something.
Otherwise, what's the point?

464
00:36:35,566 --> 00:36:40,374
Of course, I don't have to know what
it means. I own it. That's enough.

465
00:36:40,541 --> 00:36:44,082
That's all that matters?
Ownership? Possession?

466
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:47,249
How much land does the Church own?
How much gold?

467
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:49,274
That's the Church. It's not me.

468
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:52,332
You are a representative of
the Church, are you not?

469
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,599
- If you say so.
- I do say so, yeah.

470
00:36:54,666 --> 00:36:57,040
I think you're a very
judgmental man, father.

471
00:36:57,208 --> 00:36:59,174
Yes I am. But I try not to be.

472
00:36:59,241 --> 00:37:02,332
You think I don't have feelings?
You think I don't care about...

473
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,364
I think you don't want
to do penance at all!

474
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:06,632
I think you asked me
here to make fun of me.

475
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:12,582
When you want to do penance sincerely,
you can give me a call, at any time,

476
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,915
and I'll try my
best to help you!

477
00:37:16,916 --> 00:37:18,857
I could piss on this, you know.

478
00:37:20,591 --> 00:37:23,582
I said I love it, I don't. It
doesn't mean anything to me.

479
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:26,949
I could take it down right now and
piss on it. Do you want me to do that?

480
00:37:27,158 --> 00:37:30,249
- Why would I want you to do that?
- I don't know.

481
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:33,915
So I can have some sort of...
spiritual revelation.

482
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:37,374
Some sort of fucking
epiphany, huh?

483
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:40,415
OK, let's go.

484
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:48,124
I'll give you an epiphany.

485
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:50,082
Well, I don't own it.

486
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:55,832
People like you have pissed on
everything else, I suppose. So why not?

487
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:19,124
You have your tools done, I see.

488
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,290
Who is it?

489
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:23,124
French couple. Head on.

490
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:26,749
She was totally unscathed.
He got fucked.

491
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:28,624
Wrong side of the road?

492
00:38:28,666 --> 00:38:32,332
The others hit them
drunk, of course.

493
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,999
- How many?
- Five, and I'm including the Frenchman.

494
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:38,790
Dear God!

495
00:38:38,958 --> 00:38:40,874
Marine biologist he was.

496
00:38:41,041 --> 00:38:44,290
That's where I'd like to be...
under the sea.

497
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:49,290
- Where are the others?
- The morgue. Best place for them.

498
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:52,415
Every life is sacred, Frank.
For God's sake.

499
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:56,124
I know. Some are less
sacred than others.

500
00:39:07,591 --> 00:39:10,282
Through this holy anointing may
the Lord in his love and mercy...

501
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:11,790
help you...

502
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,624
with the grace of
the Holy Spirit.

503
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:16,665
Amen.

504
00:39:23,916 --> 00:39:29,082
May the Lord who frees you from
sin save you... and raise you up.

505
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:30,957
Amen.

506
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:40,124
Have you performed the
last rites many times?

507
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:44,957
Yes. Usually with older
people, of course.

508
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:49,165
They have time to
prepare for it.

509
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:53,207
Everybody knows it's coming.

510
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:57,582
It is easier?

511
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,165
It's never easy.

512
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:03,165
More understandable, I'd say.

513
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:06,165
Less unfair.

514
00:40:06,833 --> 00:40:09,124
In situations like this one,

515
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:12,207
people are shocked.

516
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:14,749
The randomness of it.

517
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:20,082
They curse God. They
curse their fellow man.

518
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:22,832
They lose their faith
in some cases.

519
00:40:24,708 --> 00:40:27,332
They lose their faith?

520
00:40:29,125 --> 00:40:31,965
It must not have been much
of a faith to begin with.

521
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:34,490
If it is so easy for
them to lose it.

522
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:38,040
Yes, but what is faith...

523
00:40:38,208 --> 00:40:42,040
for most people is the fear of death.
It's nothing more than that.

524
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:46,665
If that's all it is,
it's very easy to lose.

525
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,415
He was a good man, your husband?

526
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,332
Yes.

527
00:40:57,791 --> 00:41:00,165
He was a good man.

528
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:07,082
We had a very good life together.
We loved each other very much.

529
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:10,457
And now...

530
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:13,290
he has gone.

531
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:17,915
And that is not unfair.

532
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:21,999
That is just what happened.

533
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:29,957
But many people don't
live good lives.

534
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:35,874
They don't feel love.

535
00:41:38,291 --> 00:41:40,624
That is why it's unfair.

536
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:45,082
I feel sorry for them.

537
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,957
Will you say a prayer
with me, Theresa?

538
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:59,249
Hail Mary, full of Grace,
the Lord is with Thee.

539
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:04,790
Blessed art thou among women, and blessed
is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

540
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:08,540
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners now,

541
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:12,249
and at the hour of death. Amen.

542
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:27,207
Finished with all
your gobbledygook?

543
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:31,415
How's she holding up?

544
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:35,874
- She's a strong woman.
- Good-looking too!

545
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,832
I could be in there.

546
00:42:38,041 --> 00:42:41,832
I've a thing for widowers.
Did I ever tell you?

547
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:47,457
I think you might have done. Your
material is getting a little stale.

548
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:51,999
Sure. The atheistic doctor.
It's a clichéd part to play.

549
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:54,749
There aren't that
many good lines.

550
00:42:54,916 --> 00:42:59,957
One part humanism to nine
parts gallows humor.

551
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:04,624
Playing you, though? Now,
that might be interesting.

552
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,124
Playing me. Who's me?

553
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:09,207
The good priest.

554
00:43:13,666 --> 00:43:15,790
Excuse me, won't you?

555
00:43:16,541 --> 00:43:18,665
I have to go kill somebody.

556
00:43:39,291 --> 00:43:41,499
How long was I out?

557
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:44,707
Ages. Eons.

558
00:43:44,966 --> 00:43:47,582
Did I ever tell you the
story about Finn McCool?

559
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,165
And another big strong
lad called Kik Satoin?

560
00:43:50,233 --> 00:43:54,207
- They were at the top of the mountain.
- They were at the top of the mountain.

561
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:57,665
Kik as a challenge throws a boulder
into the Sea and Iski couldn't do it.

562
00:43:57,875 --> 00:43:59,374
Finn accepted the challenge.

563
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:01,857
His boulder landed on the shore,

564
00:44:01,925 --> 00:44:05,665
creating such waves that the sea
hasn't been the same since,

565
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:09,832
which is why the Eastern Coast is
renowned internationally for surfing.

566
00:44:10,416 --> 00:44:13,624
The boulder Finn had thrown
landed here, he drew his sword,

567
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:15,624
split the rock in
two and it said:

568
00:44:15,791 --> 00:44:17,624
If I shoot someone
foolhardy enough...

569
00:44:17,691 --> 00:44:21,540
to pass through the rock three times,
they'll be squished into tiny lumps.

570
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:23,540
Unceremoniously.

571
00:44:24,875 --> 00:44:29,874
Not a lot of poetry in that recital.
Not a lot of romance.

572
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:32,332
I'm sick to death of romance.

573
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:38,374
He was a Japanese writer.
Committed suicide.

574
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:45,040
He wrote out a list beforehand of all
the famous suicides throughout history.

575
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:47,624
He included Christ.

576
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:50,415
Sounds like a smart-ass.

577
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:54,249
In the Middle Ages they'd just
say I was possessed by demons.

578
00:44:54,416 --> 00:44:56,290
Maybe you were.

579
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:59,640
Maybe they were nearer
the mark back then.

580
00:44:59,708 --> 00:45:02,499
You think what happened
was unimportant.

581
00:45:03,416 --> 00:45:09,332
Insignificant in the great scheme of
things to provoke such a reaction.

582
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,582
But what may...

583
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,165
But what may mean nothing to you
may be very important to me.

584
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:24,457
I'd never say it
was unimportant.

585
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:29,607
I just say the choices you
make when you're thirty...

586
00:45:29,783 --> 00:45:32,707
are not the same choices you
make when you're sixty.

587
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:35,165
That's irrelevant.

588
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:39,832
Every mode of living has its
own logic, its own meaning.

589
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,040
Maybe so.

590
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:45,507
Maybe you're right there. I'll
have to think about that.

591
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,207
It's a tired old
argument, I suppose.

592
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:56,332
But what about those
you leave behind?

593
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,290
They belong to myself,
not to anybody else.

594
00:45:59,416 --> 00:46:01,332
True.

595
00:46:03,916 --> 00:46:06,082
False.

596
00:46:06,916 --> 00:46:10,957
You'll tell me you would have
been in mortal sin, I suppose?

597
00:46:15,416 --> 00:46:18,457
But I have suffered eternal
damnation, Father.

598
00:46:23,916 --> 00:46:25,749
God is great.

599
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:29,999
The limits of His mercy
have not been set.

600
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:38,124
Is this where you
want to be buried?

601
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:43,415
Why in hell would I want to be buried
in a God-forsaken place like this?

602
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:48,999
Where, then? Père-Lachaise?
Next to dear old Oscar?

603
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:51,915
Next to Apollinaire
and Max Ophüls.

604
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:54,207
Very fancy, I must say.

605
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:57,182
- I have your gun for you by the way.
- Yeah, right.

606
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:02,665
I do so! Webley, circa 1920. Still
in good working order, though.

607
00:47:02,875 --> 00:47:05,249
Or so I've been told by
a man who would know.

608
00:47:05,458 --> 00:47:08,749
- Hand it over, then.
- I don't have it on me.

609
00:47:08,916 --> 00:47:11,832
I knew it. Worried I might
follow through with it, huh?

610
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,182
You might take a pot shot
at me, for all I know.

611
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:18,665
Why would I do that? What have you
ever done to me except talk garbage?

612
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:20,874
That doesn't mean anything.

613
00:47:20,916 --> 00:47:24,832
Bloody idiots can't even be bothered
with a reason for murder these days.

614
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,332
Come up to a fellow and
it's bang, bang, bang.

615
00:47:27,541 --> 00:47:32,207
I don't know about that. Some
people have very good reasons.

616
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:39,499
Who are you here to see, Father?

617
00:47:39,666 --> 00:47:40,915
Freddy Joyce.

618
00:47:43,041 --> 00:47:45,915
- Freddy Joyce, the murd...
- I know who he is.

619
00:47:46,025 --> 00:47:48,082
Why the hell do you
want to see him for?

620
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,757
He's an old pupil of mine.
He asked to see me.

621
00:47:58,291 --> 00:48:00,624
You know I've asked
them to hang me.

622
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:04,624
There's no capital punishment in
Ireland, Freddy, as you well know.

623
00:48:04,666 --> 00:48:07,932
- Why do you want them to hang you?
- That's the way Leslie Ryan died.

624
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,624
You're saying you feel remorse?

625
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:12,999
I'm not a monster. Do I
look like a monster?

626
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:16,249
What do monsters look like?

627
00:48:17,041 --> 00:48:19,749
I had the cops in
here the other day.

628
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:25,624
In third degree. Wanting to
go over all the gory details.

629
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:29,082
Which I'm sure you were
only too happy to provide.

630
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:31,790
They're obsessed
with cannibalism.

631
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,332
"What did it taste like?"

632
00:48:34,875 --> 00:48:39,082
I told them it tasted like pheasant.
A bit gamy.

633
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:43,165
Good for you. Make
a joke about it.

634
00:48:46,416 --> 00:48:48,457
- Why were they...?
- Same as always.

635
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,738
They want to know who the last one is.
The one they never found.

636
00:48:52,463 --> 00:48:54,071
The one I connected up.

637
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,832
Why can't you tell them, Freddy?

638
00:49:02,041 --> 00:49:04,665
To find some kind of peace.

639
00:49:04,833 --> 00:49:07,749
I wanted to...

640
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:11,749
Father, for the life of me, I cannot...
remember where I put...

641
00:49:12,016 --> 00:49:14,499
I mean, I know it was
in the woods somewhere.

642
00:49:14,541 --> 00:49:17,999
- Where did I leave my keys?
- No! I wasn't in my right mind.

643
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:21,665
The LSD... it was like a...
fairytale.

644
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:26,582
You said all that at the trial, Freddy.
It's getting kind of tiresome now.

645
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:31,165
She was a lovely...

646
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,374
She was a lovely girl.

647
00:49:36,416 --> 00:49:39,374
You know she told me that
she'd been abused before?

648
00:49:39,541 --> 00:49:42,749
So I says: once more won't
make any difference, then.

649
00:49:50,708 --> 00:49:53,624
You see the light go
out in their eyes...

650
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:57,290
- And you become God!
- No you don't!

651
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:03,290
No you don't.

652
00:50:05,666 --> 00:50:07,957
Why am I here?

653
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:12,957
I just wanted
someone to talk to.

654
00:50:14,916 --> 00:50:20,457
I don't think you feel any guilt
whatsoever, about anything you've done.

655
00:50:20,625 --> 00:50:23,032
I do. I do, Father.

656
00:50:25,958 --> 00:50:28,540
I believe what the
Bible teaches.

657
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:31,840
I believe that if I repent my
sins, then I'll be forgiven.

658
00:50:31,908 --> 00:50:33,982
And I'll be able to
go up to heaven,

659
00:50:34,007 --> 00:50:37,407
and I'll see those girls and
I'll tell them how sorry I am.

660
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:43,124
I'll hug them and I'll kiss them, and
I'll love them with the real, true love.

661
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:46,332
I'll have no desire to
hurt them in any way.

662
00:50:51,291 --> 00:50:53,965
God made me, didn't he?

663
00:50:56,458 --> 00:50:58,790
Didn't he?

664
00:51:00,125 --> 00:51:02,957
So he understands me.

665
00:51:03,041 --> 00:51:05,249
He must do.

666
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:11,999
Don't you think?

667
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:18,540
I think if God can't
understand you, Freddy...

668
00:51:19,541 --> 00:51:21,015
no one can.

669
00:51:30,675 --> 00:51:32,749
You know they're
foreclosing on me?

670
00:51:32,916 --> 00:51:36,332
- Who?
- Who? The banks, who else?

671
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,249
Sorry to hear that.

672
00:51:38,291 --> 00:51:41,174
How come I never hear your
mob preaching about that?

673
00:51:41,241 --> 00:51:42,332
About what?

674
00:51:42,416 --> 00:51:45,740
About all these bankers who have
brought this country to its knees?

675
00:51:46,916 --> 00:51:50,790
Still driving people out of their
homes for not making their payments.

676
00:51:51,083 --> 00:51:54,165
Ever hear your mob
talk about that?

677
00:51:54,333 --> 00:51:55,915
Those are things
too, aren't they?

678
00:51:55,958 --> 00:51:57,582
Yes, they are.

679
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:58,824
That's right.

680
00:51:59,166 --> 00:52:03,232
I suppose when you have a history of
screwing the Jews out of their money,

681
00:52:03,257 --> 00:52:05,057
and collaborating
with the Nazis.

682
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:08,415
It's like the pot calling
the kettle black, eh?

683
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:12,707
I suppose it is. Getting full use out
of your library card there, Brendan.

684
00:52:12,875 --> 00:52:17,874
Library's been shut down.
Did you not hear? Cutbacks.

685
00:52:43,041 --> 00:52:45,082
You're not dancing, Milo.

686
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:47,374
I don't like this music.

687
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:49,582
What music do you like?

688
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,707
Dolly Parton.

689
00:52:51,916 --> 00:52:53,790
Dolly Parton's good, yeah.

690
00:53:01,708 --> 00:53:03,249
Great cocaine!

691
00:53:04,625 --> 00:53:06,832
Very moreish!

692
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:14,124
Totally medicinal, Father.

693
00:53:23,458 --> 00:53:25,282
How was your man, Joyce?

694
00:53:26,508 --> 00:53:29,374
It's been a tough day,
let's put it that way.

695
00:53:29,883 --> 00:53:32,582
How can you hope to connect
with someone like that?

696
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:35,957
What are you talking about?
Not Freddy Joyce!

697
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:37,999
I visited him in prison today.

698
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:39,382
Why?

699
00:53:39,391 --> 00:53:43,415
A prisoner deserves spiritual guidance
as much as anyone else. Maybe more so.

700
00:53:43,583 --> 00:53:47,624
Is that right? So
they can find God.

701
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:51,749
And then say God has absolved
them of all their sins.

702
00:53:51,916 --> 00:53:55,749
And what they did didn't really matter
anyways, 'cause now they're saved!

703
00:53:55,791 --> 00:53:56,999
Something like that, yeah.

704
00:53:57,166 --> 00:54:00,032
Calm down. You don't know
what you're talking about.

705
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:08,540
Do you mind the drinks?
For Christ's sake!

706
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:13,665
He had that coming a long time.
You know yourself.

707
00:54:25,541 --> 00:54:27,749
Fine-looking man.

708
00:54:27,958 --> 00:54:29,999
Watch yourself with him.

709
00:54:30,291 --> 00:54:33,290
I gave up cocaine
a long time ago.

710
00:54:34,333 --> 00:54:36,457
You took cocaine?

711
00:54:36,625 --> 00:54:38,790
Come on, let's dance.

712
00:54:39,625 --> 00:54:41,999
- No, no.
- How'd they call it in your day, jive?

713
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:43,957
- No, no.
- Come on!

714
00:55:15,541 --> 00:55:18,999
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

715
00:55:19,208 --> 00:55:22,165
Say one Our Father
and ten Hail Mary's.

716
00:55:22,458 --> 00:55:24,749
I've sinned more than that.

717
00:55:24,958 --> 00:55:28,332
Make an ascent to Croagh Patrick, then.
On your knees.

718
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:32,124
On my knees, is it?
What made you say that?

719
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,624
- Your church is on fire.
- Fuck off Brendan. I'm not in the mood.

720
00:55:44,833 --> 00:55:47,540
You're church is on fire!

721
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,707
Jesus Christ!

722
00:55:58,708 --> 00:56:01,124
I called the fire
brigade, Father.

723
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,665
For all the good it'll do.

724
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:06,624
They'll never get here in time.

725
00:56:09,875 --> 00:56:12,665
- Why didn't anybody see?
- Daddy, stay away.

726
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:16,415
Daddy! Come away.

727
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,582
Why didn't anybody see?

728
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:30,249
They're probably going
to blame you for this.

729
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,165
Professional job, I'd
say that for them.

730
00:56:39,375 --> 00:56:42,415
Any fool can start a
fire, for fuck's sake.

731
00:57:01,875 --> 00:57:03,457
Who'd do a thing like this?

732
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,374
Somebody with a grudge against
the Church, obviously.

733
00:57:06,541 --> 00:57:08,540
That could be half the country.

734
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:10,790
Unless it's a personal angle.

735
00:57:10,958 --> 00:57:14,790
- How'd you mean? - Nobody had a
grudge against your father, no?

736
00:57:16,583 --> 00:57:18,832
Who'd have a grudge against you?

737
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:21,374
Maybe this is the future, huh?

738
00:57:21,916 --> 00:57:24,665
Maybe it'll all
be ruins one day.

739
00:57:24,916 --> 00:57:29,207
Maybe one day kids will say in
amazement: They used to believe in what?

740
00:57:29,416 --> 00:57:30,953
And all that up in the sky.

741
00:57:30,978 --> 00:57:35,058
And if we're good we'll go to heaven.
And if we're bad we'll go to hell.

742
00:57:36,016 --> 00:57:40,082
You know, for a policeman you seem to
know very little about human nature.

743
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:43,957
Maybe you're right. You
know more than me.

744
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:46,624
Don't touch anything now.

745
00:57:46,833 --> 00:57:50,999
Have to get the forensics boys down.
The supercilious pricks!

746
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,915
What do we do now?

747
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:05,165
We'll have to rebuild
it, I suppose.

748
00:58:05,458 --> 00:58:09,374
Maybe use bricks next time.
Might be a good idea.

749
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,832
Oh, God, Father.

750
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,457
Is this about the coke? I
can take it or leave it.

751
00:58:32,791 --> 00:58:34,457
Really?

752
00:58:34,625 --> 00:58:36,999
Yeah. Most people can.

753
00:58:37,041 --> 00:58:40,082
The only ones who can't have
problems to begin with.

754
00:58:40,291 --> 00:58:44,574
We shouldn't write them off, though. The
ones who have problems to begin with.

755
00:58:46,991 --> 00:58:49,624
What do you want to do
with your life, Veronica?

756
00:58:52,583 --> 00:58:54,415
Nothing.

757
00:58:54,833 --> 00:58:57,557
Consider the lilies of the
field, how they grow:

758
00:58:57,582 --> 00:58:59,682
they toil not, neither
do they spin.

759
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:01,915
Very nice quotation.

760
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:04,207
Sure. Everybody knows that one.

761
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:05,524
Hackneyed, yeah.

762
00:59:05,566 --> 00:59:09,507
It's like "turn the other cheek".
Or "judge not lest you be judged".

763
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:13,907
I'd like to be an
actress, maybe.

764
00:59:14,116 --> 00:59:16,790
I've an absent father
and domineering mother.

765
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,915
That's a start.

766
00:59:19,708 --> 00:59:21,624
When did your dad leave?

767
00:59:21,833 --> 00:59:24,374
He didn't leave, he was killed.

768
00:59:25,416 --> 00:59:28,290
- Murdered?
- Hunting accident.

769
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:29,815
Completely random.

770
00:59:31,583 --> 00:59:35,571
So there's no use persevering, Father.
I'm a lost cause.

771
00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:40,665
No one is a lost
cause, Veronica.

772
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:47,749
Who is it?

773
00:59:48,916 --> 00:59:51,040
I don't know who it is.

774
00:59:54,083 --> 00:59:56,165
You said you did.

775
00:59:56,375 --> 00:59:58,582
I've no evidence
it's the same man.

776
00:59:58,833 --> 01:00:03,874
It's the same man. Takes a lot
of nerve to burn down a church.

777
01:00:04,666 --> 01:00:09,582
Helps if you have a burning sense of
grievance, if you'll pardon the...

778
01:00:09,791 --> 01:00:14,124
We have to ask ourselves:
What does this man want?

779
01:00:15,041 --> 01:00:18,915
He wants to be loved, of course.
We all want to be loved.

780
01:00:19,375 --> 01:00:22,740
Failing that he wants to be...
admired.

781
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:26,874
Failing that he
wants to be feared.

782
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:30,674
Failing that, he wants to
be hated and despised.

783
01:00:30,725 --> 01:00:33,824
You should beware the man who
wants to be hated and despised.

784
01:00:33,866 --> 01:00:36,474
Don't you think?

785
01:00:37,666 --> 01:00:41,665
I think you read that in
a book, your Excellency.

786
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:48,374
I think he wants to stir up some sort
of feelings in others. That's true.

787
01:00:49,333 --> 01:00:51,915
Doesn't want to be
ignored any more.

788
01:00:53,208 --> 01:00:55,540
Wants to make contact.

789
01:00:56,208 --> 01:00:58,582
He made contact all right.

790
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:02,915
Who is it?

791
01:01:09,325 --> 01:01:11,065
Dreadful business, I must say.

792
01:01:11,075 --> 01:01:14,249
Some little blackguard running
riot, I wouldn't wonder.

793
01:01:14,291 --> 01:01:16,624
What can you do in
this day and age?

794
01:01:16,833 --> 01:01:18,749
True that.

795
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,665
Sorry about the
other day, Father.

796
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:25,040
That was the drink talking.

797
01:01:25,416 --> 01:01:26,832
What can we do for you?

798
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:31,374
It's off the bat with what I was saying.
And it seems more necessary than ever.

799
01:01:31,541 --> 01:01:33,499
I'd like to make a donation.

800
01:01:36,708 --> 01:01:38,365
That would be grand.

801
01:01:38,433 --> 01:01:40,290
To salve your conscience?

802
01:01:40,333 --> 01:01:44,415
Surely that's in the nature of all
philanthropy. The expiation of guilt.

803
01:01:44,625 --> 01:01:48,790
I'm sure you've nothing major to
feel guilty about, Mr. Fitzgerald.

804
01:01:48,958 --> 01:01:53,207
You'd be surprised, Father.
Call me Michael.

805
01:01:54,875 --> 01:01:59,207
Michael it is. Any charity is
always gratefully received.

806
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:00,582
I know.

807
01:02:00,791 --> 01:02:03,290
I believe that's
Church doctrine.

808
01:02:03,458 --> 01:02:07,624
The Church needs all the help it can get.
Especially these days.

809
01:02:07,733 --> 01:02:08,899
Why would you say that?

810
01:02:09,008 --> 01:02:12,832
Well, with all the compensation that's
been paid out over the last few years?

811
01:02:15,575 --> 01:02:18,915
And that's only the Yanks, we
all know they weren't worst.

812
01:02:18,958 --> 01:02:23,624
I don't know about that. Most of
those cases were 40 or 50 years ago.

813
01:02:23,833 --> 01:02:26,874
Raking up old ground it
always seemed to me.

814
01:02:27,166 --> 01:02:30,624
- Time to forgive and forget.
- I agree. I agree.

815
01:02:30,875 --> 01:02:34,082
What's past is past.
Time to move on.

816
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:36,590
Etcetera, etcetera.

817
01:02:39,308 --> 01:02:43,082
Would you like a cup of tea, Michael,
or maybe something stronger?

818
01:02:43,291 --> 01:02:47,457
Do you have any crystal meth?
No, no. I can't stop.

819
01:02:47,666 --> 01:02:51,588
So what are we talking about?
Ten? Twenty?

820
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:54,582
Twenty thousand?

821
01:02:55,375 --> 01:02:57,707
Twenty thousand Euros, yeah.

822
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,115
Well, that would be grand.

823
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,790
That would help us getting the initial
building work off the ground.

824
01:03:04,833 --> 01:03:06,415
Twenty it is, then.

825
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:09,457
This is a David Oscarson pen.

826
01:03:09,833 --> 01:03:11,832
It's really expensive.

827
01:03:11,916 --> 01:03:13,832
It's lovely.

828
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,999
Why not make it fifty?

829
01:03:16,166 --> 01:03:18,290
Well, Father!

830
01:03:20,041 --> 01:03:23,499
If money is no object,
make it fifty.

831
01:03:25,416 --> 01:03:28,707
Why not make it a hundred?
It means nothing to me.

832
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,790
I know it doesn't.

833
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:36,957
100,000 Euros for your pet project, Father.
What do you say to that?

834
01:03:36,958 --> 01:03:40,249
I say: Thank you, Mr.
Fitzgerald.

835
01:03:41,166 --> 01:03:43,790
What was Stanton getting on?

836
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,290
If I could tell you, I would.
You know that.

837
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:51,249
I thought I was the one that was
supposed to be in trouble, not you.

838
01:03:52,333 --> 01:03:54,665
How's the fish.?

839
01:03:55,041 --> 01:03:56,915
Too many little bones.

840
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:58,832
Isn't that always the way?

841
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,249
Not stopping.

842
01:04:01,458 --> 01:04:03,540
Meeting a fellow.

843
01:04:03,708 --> 01:04:06,415
You're informing me of
your adultery in advance.

844
01:04:06,583 --> 01:04:09,157
Isn't that more honest
than in the confessional?

845
01:04:09,166 --> 01:04:12,215
When it's all done and dusted, and
there's nothing you can do about it.

846
01:04:12,283 --> 01:04:13,749
What are you
expecting him to do?

847
01:04:13,875 --> 01:04:15,924
Stop me from committing
a mortal sin.

848
01:04:15,991 --> 01:04:18,749
You have to stop yourself.
I can't stop you.

849
01:04:19,291 --> 01:04:21,457
Then what good are you at all?

850
01:04:21,833 --> 01:04:24,415
There's my ride, as it were.

851
01:04:25,916 --> 01:04:28,624
Let's do this again, sometime.

852
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:39,240
Do you have to put up with that
kind of shit on a regular basis?

853
01:04:40,533 --> 01:04:43,624
There's a lot of it going
around, let's put it that way.

854
01:04:48,708 --> 01:04:51,499
We really should talk, you know.
Let it all out.

855
01:04:53,416 --> 01:04:56,749
Like in one of those
shit plays at the abbey.

856
01:04:58,291 --> 01:05:02,082
I don't know what the
revelation would be, though.

857
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:04,249
Neither do I.

858
01:05:06,416 --> 01:05:10,382
Your mother dying killed a little
something in both of us, I know that.

859
01:05:11,458 --> 01:05:14,915
It was a long goodbye,
if ever there was one.

860
01:05:15,125 --> 01:05:18,832
Sometimes I wish she hadn't
hanged on as long as she did.

861
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:21,707
She was stubborn all right.

862
01:05:21,916 --> 01:05:24,124
Brave too, though.

863
01:05:24,375 --> 01:05:27,249
Wonder if I'll be as brave
when the time comes.

864
01:05:27,541 --> 01:05:30,249
It wasn't just her dying.

865
01:05:30,458 --> 01:05:34,707
You were missing in action a long time.
Before and after.

866
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:37,999
When I needed you most.

867
01:05:39,458 --> 01:05:42,082
I was never neglectful,
I don't think.

868
01:05:43,708 --> 01:05:45,790
Never hit you or anything.

869
01:05:45,958 --> 01:05:47,874
There are other
forms of violence.

870
01:05:48,125 --> 01:05:51,582
I know there are! Attempting
suicide, for one.

871
01:05:52,041 --> 01:05:53,765
Jesus! I walked into that one.

872
01:05:53,775 --> 01:05:55,999
It's not only violence
against yourself, either.

873
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:58,249
It wasn't intended that way.

874
01:05:58,916 --> 01:06:00,749
I never meant to hurt you.

875
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:03,915
How could it not hurt me?
I love you!

876
01:06:04,541 --> 01:06:06,874
I love you too.

877
01:06:06,916 --> 01:06:09,540
Don't ever doubt that.

878
01:06:14,458 --> 01:06:16,374
Dad...

879
01:06:17,416 --> 01:06:20,582
And just when I thought
I had you back,

880
01:06:20,791 --> 01:06:24,790
and you were ship-shape and
rearing to go, go you did.

881
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:29,957
I thought it would
be another woman.

882
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,040
I have a vocation. I
wasn't trying to escape!

883
01:06:33,066 --> 01:06:35,582
I know that! I know
you're sincere.

884
01:06:37,166 --> 01:06:39,957
But, Dad, the fact remains.

885
01:06:40,416 --> 01:06:44,999
First Mum went away, and
then you went away.

886
01:06:46,625 --> 01:06:50,582
I lost two parents for
the price of one.

887
01:06:52,791 --> 01:06:55,540
I never ran anywhere.
I stayed here.

888
01:06:55,583 --> 01:06:58,290
I think you're being a
bit naive there, Father.

889
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,374
I'm still here.

890
01:07:00,541 --> 01:07:02,999
I'll always be here.

891
01:07:04,916 --> 01:07:07,290
Will you?

892
01:07:07,833 --> 01:07:10,290
You promise?

893
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:15,624
I'll always be here.

894
01:07:15,833 --> 01:07:18,707
And you'll always be here.

895
01:07:31,291 --> 01:07:33,707
How was that for a
third act revelation?

896
01:07:34,416 --> 01:07:36,457
Corny.

897
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:39,332
But I like it.

898
01:07:50,074 --> 01:07:51,467
Here.

899
01:08:00,166 --> 01:08:02,624
Here's mud in your eye!

900
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:08,165
Great stuff!

901
01:08:13,083 --> 01:08:18,249
You know I can tell when
you're really getting old.

902
01:08:18,916 --> 01:08:20,207
How?

903
01:08:20,416 --> 01:08:25,790
No one ever says the word
"death" around you anymore.

904
01:08:30,375 --> 01:08:33,140
Bruno! Bruno!

905
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:54,540
Oh Bruno!

906
01:08:56,041 --> 01:09:00,290
What has he done to Bruno?

907
01:09:20,083 --> 01:09:22,915
Oh, I forgot to say
goodbye to Bruno!

908
01:09:23,041 --> 01:09:25,874
- I'll give him a big kiss on you.
- Oh, do!

909
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:28,874
- I'll be fine from here.
- Will you?

910
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:32,999
Well let's just say
today I'm fine.

911
01:09:33,208 --> 01:09:35,082
So you say.

912
01:10:02,208 --> 01:10:05,415
Hello! Where are you off to?

913
01:10:05,583 --> 01:10:06,699
The beach.

914
01:10:06,866 --> 01:10:09,290
- It's nice at the beach, isn't it?
- Yeah.

915
01:10:09,458 --> 01:10:10,707
You surf?

916
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:13,957
No, my dad won't let me.
Says it's too dangerous.

917
01:10:15,083 --> 01:10:18,165
What does he know? The meany!

918
01:10:18,875 --> 01:10:20,874
You're here on holidays?

919
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:23,249
- Where are you from? Wicklow!
- Yeah.

920
01:10:23,416 --> 01:10:25,790
Never mind. I won't
hold it against you.

921
01:10:27,166 --> 01:10:29,582
Jeanine! Get in the car.

922
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:32,790
What were you saying to her?

923
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,832
- I wasn't saying anything to her.
- Oh, really?

924
01:10:34,875 --> 01:10:37,249
It looked like a fucking
conversation to me.

925
01:10:40,916 --> 01:10:43,124
Where the hell did
you get to, honey?

926
01:10:43,166 --> 01:10:45,182
I've been looking
all over for you.

927
01:10:57,541 --> 01:10:59,749
Large one.

928
01:11:01,541 --> 01:11:03,040
You sure about that?

929
01:11:03,250 --> 01:11:05,082
Whiskey, I said.

930
01:11:09,741 --> 01:11:13,249
Who burnt down your church, Father?
If you don't mind me asking.

931
01:11:13,416 --> 01:11:17,415
It's not my church.
It's our church.

932
01:11:17,458 --> 01:11:19,624
I'd say it was the Romanians.

933
01:11:19,791 --> 01:11:23,707
They're awful heathens.
The Romanians.

934
01:11:23,891 --> 01:11:25,932
What Romanians do we
have around here?

935
01:11:26,041 --> 01:11:30,915
They're always hanging around. Romanians.
Getting up to no good.

936
01:11:31,083 --> 01:11:34,165
Must be someone who
doesn't like you, Father.

937
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:37,415
I think it must be one of the
good people in this town.

938
01:11:37,625 --> 01:11:42,499
You should join the Garda, Simon.
With your "powers of deduction".

939
01:11:53,916 --> 01:11:58,707
These measures, huh, Father? Like a
buttercup in the mouth of a cow.

940
01:12:00,208 --> 01:12:02,624
Pint there, please, Brendan.

941
01:12:04,458 --> 01:12:08,582
So you're sure there's a
God then, Father, yeah?

942
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:16,707
I'm not kidding.

943
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:21,707
I'm being serious. I'm asking
because I'm having doubts myself.

944
01:12:22,375 --> 01:12:24,774
I'm having a crisis of faith.

945
01:12:27,958 --> 01:12:30,165
Don't be getting offended.

946
01:12:30,416 --> 01:12:34,999
Fa... I'm sorry! Really I am!

947
01:12:35,208 --> 01:12:40,790
As sure as a hole in the ground...
Don't be going away mad!

948
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,082
I'm an awful messer.

949
01:12:50,875 --> 01:12:53,665
Hey, Father! What do you hear?
What do you say?

950
01:12:53,875 --> 01:12:55,332
You're back, so?

951
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:59,999
I've got a lot of clients in this town.
From the Hoi polloi to the masses.

952
01:13:00,208 --> 01:13:03,790
I've got to keep my ass
lubricated at all times.

953
01:13:04,916 --> 01:13:09,790
Hoi polloi are the masses of society.
You're using the phrase incorrectly.

954
01:13:09,958 --> 01:13:13,257
You know that maybe so, Father.
I didn't get no education, see?

955
01:13:13,325 --> 01:13:16,557
I was getting fucked in the ass
and fucked in the face all day.

956
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:19,290
Wasn't no time for any of that.

957
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:24,207
I was sucking the prick of a bishop
on a regular basis, you get me?

958
01:13:24,708 --> 01:13:27,665
How did you like that
play, smart ass?

959
01:13:27,833 --> 01:13:29,665
You need help.

960
01:13:29,875 --> 01:13:32,107
You're starting to
sound a little screwy.

961
01:13:32,132 --> 01:13:34,732
Maybe you need to see a
head-shrinker yourself.

962
01:13:35,416 --> 01:13:37,040
Do you need help? Are you OK?

963
01:13:37,083 --> 01:13:39,207
Hey! Father...

964
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:43,165
There's nothing wrong with me, Father.
All right?

965
01:13:45,708 --> 01:13:47,707
I'm feeling fine.

966
01:13:56,583 --> 01:13:58,415
You know...

967
01:13:58,875 --> 01:14:04,857
when I first started out working up in
Dublin, there was this 3-year-old boy.

968
01:14:07,041 --> 01:14:11,957
Parents brought him into the hospital.
A routine operation.

969
01:14:12,166 --> 01:14:16,165
But the anesthetist
made a mistake.

970
01:14:17,175 --> 01:14:23,117
Little boy ended up
deaf, dumb, blind...

971
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,165
and paralyzed. For good.

972
01:14:31,083 --> 01:14:33,707
Think of it!

973
01:14:33,916 --> 01:14:37,374
Think when that little boy
first regained consciousness.

974
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,374
In the dark. You'd be
frightened, wouldnt you?

975
01:14:43,166 --> 01:14:49,065
You'd be frightened in the kind of a way
that you know the fear is going to end.

976
01:14:50,375 --> 01:14:52,915
Has to.

977
01:14:53,458 --> 01:14:58,124
Must. Your parents
couldn't be too far away.

978
01:14:58,375 --> 01:15:01,124
They'll come to your rescue.

979
01:15:01,333 --> 01:15:05,499
They'll turn the light on.
They'll talk to you.

980
01:15:06,541 --> 01:15:09,374
But... think of it.

981
01:15:10,541 --> 01:15:15,832
Nobody comes to rescue you.
No light is turned on.

982
01:15:16,875 --> 01:15:19,198
You are in the dark.

983
01:15:19,859 --> 01:15:23,548
You try to speak...
but you can't.

984
01:15:24,416 --> 01:15:29,374
You try to move...
but you can't.

985
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:35,332
You try to cry out. But you are
unable to hear your own screams.

986
01:15:36,625 --> 01:15:40,124
You are entombed
within your own body.

987
01:15:41,083 --> 01:15:44,032
Howling with terror.

988
01:15:53,541 --> 01:15:56,332
What the fuck?

989
01:15:56,708 --> 01:16:00,665
Why the fuck would you
tell me a story like that?

990
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:02,832
No reason.

991
01:16:13,083 --> 01:16:16,165
Some people are awfully touchy.

992
01:16:17,416 --> 01:16:19,332
Good luck!

993
01:17:07,541 --> 01:17:09,957
Time to go. Come on.

994
01:17:10,666 --> 01:17:13,790
You're still drinking.
Same again.

995
01:17:13,833 --> 01:17:15,915
Time to go, I said.

996
01:17:17,083 --> 01:17:18,707
Is that an order?

997
01:17:18,875 --> 01:17:21,707
You don't like taking
orders, Father?

998
01:17:21,875 --> 01:17:23,790
You do not mind giving them.

999
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,082
These kinds are all alike.

1000
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:30,582
- My "kind".
- Yeah, your "kind".

1001
01:17:31,125 --> 01:17:33,749
Your time is gone and you don't
even fucking realize it.

1002
01:17:33,958 --> 01:17:35,582
My time will never be gone.

1003
01:17:35,625 --> 01:17:38,999
Did you hear that? The
arrogance of the man.

1004
01:17:39,166 --> 01:17:41,190
You need to be a
little more humble.

1005
01:17:41,258 --> 01:17:44,499
Needs to be taken down a peg or two.
That's what he needs.

1006
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:53,540
Take me down, then.

1007
01:17:53,958 --> 01:17:57,457
Go on, I fucking dare you.

1008
01:18:33,291 --> 01:18:34,832
Jesus Christ!

1009
01:18:34,958 --> 01:18:37,665
- What happened to you?
- Brendan Lynch.

1010
01:18:37,875 --> 01:18:39,949
Brendan Lynch? He's a Buddhist!

1011
01:18:40,058 --> 01:18:44,132
So what if he's a fucking Buddhist? You
think Buddhists don't beat people up?

1012
01:18:44,258 --> 01:18:47,290
You think Buddhists don't fuck
their kids like everyone else?

1013
01:18:47,458 --> 01:18:48,782
You're obviously very upset!

1014
01:18:48,833 --> 01:18:52,832
Tibetans spit on blind people in the
street! Their killing albinos in Africa!

1015
01:18:53,041 --> 01:18:54,665
You're so fucking naive.

1016
01:18:54,833 --> 01:18:56,457
Please don't curse
at me, Father.

1017
01:18:56,666 --> 01:19:00,657
I think It would be best to continue
this conversation in the morning, sober.

1018
01:19:00,666 --> 01:19:03,165
Why are you a fucking
priest at all?

1019
01:19:03,333 --> 01:19:07,957
You should be a fucking accountant!
Or a fucking insurance man!

1020
01:19:22,541 --> 01:19:25,040
Terrible!

1021
01:19:27,416 --> 01:19:29,332
Let's go home.

1022
01:19:30,958 --> 01:19:32,332
What is it?

1023
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:34,207
Nothing.

1024
01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:56,707
You're leaving?

1025
01:20:00,208 --> 01:20:01,832
I think it's for the best.

1026
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,665
Because of last night?

1027
01:20:04,125 --> 01:20:06,415
Because of a lot of things.

1028
01:20:06,583 --> 01:20:09,915
Not just last night. Or
what's happened here.

1029
01:20:12,466 --> 01:20:14,749
I've been having doubts,
if you must know.

1030
01:20:15,083 --> 01:20:17,915
Listen, I'm sorry about
what I said last night.

1031
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:22,540
You said what you said with such venom! I
didn't realize you hated me that much.

1032
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:24,665
I don't hate you at all.

1033
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,915
Then, why?

1034
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:29,149
It's just you have no integrity!

1035
01:20:29,174 --> 01:20:31,474
That's the worse I can
say about anybody.

1036
01:20:33,958 --> 01:20:36,040
Well, that's...

1037
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:40,915
- That's just...
- Hope you find what you're looking for.

1038
01:20:41,833 --> 01:20:43,915
Good luck.

1039
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:49,582
Father?

1040
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:51,290
Hello.

1041
01:21:53,958 --> 01:21:56,290
You're going to Dublin?

1042
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,749
Yeah.

1043
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:03,582
Just getting away for
a while, you know?

1044
01:22:05,625 --> 01:22:09,415
I heard about your church.
Terrible thing.

1045
01:22:10,375 --> 01:22:11,999
Yes.

1046
01:22:12,166 --> 01:22:14,290
You must be very upset.

1047
01:22:19,208 --> 01:22:21,332
Yes, I am.

1048
01:22:28,416 --> 01:22:32,415
I'm bringing him home.
To his family in Italy.

1049
01:22:34,666 --> 01:22:38,332
Dublin and then... Rome.

1050
01:22:40,333 --> 01:22:41,790
How have you been?

1051
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,957
People here have been
very kind to me.

1052
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:48,832
I mean...

1053
01:22:51,125 --> 01:22:56,040
You know, sometimes I
think I cannot go on.

1054
01:22:57,416 --> 01:22:59,207
But...

1055
01:23:00,541 --> 01:23:02,999
I will go on.

1056
01:25:32,875 --> 01:25:34,707
Father!

1057
01:25:34,875 --> 01:25:36,832
Little early for mass.

1058
01:25:36,875 --> 01:25:42,824
Dr. Hart was out fishing at the crack of
dawn. He begrudgingly gave me a ride.

1059
01:25:43,166 --> 01:25:45,207
Where are you headed?

1060
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:47,790
Just down the beach there.

1061
01:25:47,916 --> 01:25:52,124
- Can I come along?
- Not really, no. Maybe later.

1062
01:25:52,291 --> 01:25:55,499
That's fine, yeah.
I won't keep you.

1063
01:25:56,050 --> 01:25:57,624
Did you finish your book?

1064
01:25:57,666 --> 01:26:00,749
Yes, I did. I don't
know how good it is.

1065
01:26:00,791 --> 01:26:05,124
I'm sure it'll be extraordinary.
You're a very fine writer.

1066
01:26:07,041 --> 01:26:09,332
Thank you, James!

1067
01:26:11,791 --> 01:26:15,540
<i>You know you changed the subject the
other day when we were talking.</i>

1068
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:17,207
What was the subject?

1069
01:26:17,416 --> 01:26:22,349
You know what the subject was. I think
you committed a sin of omission.

1070
01:26:22,958 --> 01:26:25,832
I'm sure there are worse
sins than sins of omission.

1071
01:26:26,041 --> 01:26:28,832
I'll let you be the expert
in that department, father.

1072
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,082
I think there's too much talk
about sins, to be honest.

1073
01:26:32,625 --> 01:26:35,290
Not enough talk about virtues.

1074
01:26:35,458 --> 01:26:37,707
You might be right.

1075
01:26:39,083 --> 01:26:41,415
What would be your number one?

1076
01:26:41,583 --> 01:26:44,665
I think forgiveness has
been highly underrated.

1077
01:26:47,666 --> 01:26:49,665
I forgive you.

1078
01:26:50,958 --> 01:26:52,915
Do you forgive me?

1079
01:26:54,041 --> 01:26:56,124
Always.

1080
01:27:16,916 --> 01:27:20,957
Thinking of throwing yourself in?
They say that's the easy way out.

1081
01:27:21,166 --> 01:27:24,124
Nothing easy about it, I
wouldn't have thought.

1082
01:27:28,083 --> 01:27:30,540
I'm in a bad way, Father.

1083
01:27:33,041 --> 01:27:35,624
No, I'm not putting you on.

1084
01:27:36,583 --> 01:27:39,749
The truth is I've been
in a bad way for...

1085
01:27:40,708 --> 01:27:42,957
a long time.

1086
01:27:43,541 --> 01:27:46,165
No will to do anything.

1087
01:27:46,958 --> 01:27:50,374
Feeling of nothing
being worthwhile...

1088
01:27:51,250 --> 01:27:54,749
A sense of disassociation.

1089
01:27:55,916 --> 01:27:58,082
Detachment.

1090
01:27:58,291 --> 01:28:00,415
I had a wife and kids,

1091
01:28:01,291 --> 01:28:03,415
they meant nothing to me.

1092
01:28:07,458 --> 01:28:10,749
I have money. It
means nothing to me.

1093
01:28:12,333 --> 01:28:14,665
I have life...

1094
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:18,749
and it means nothing to me.

1095
01:28:23,416 --> 01:28:27,874
Where do you think it comes from?
The sense of detachment.

1096
01:28:31,916 --> 01:28:33,525
From nowhere.

1097
01:28:37,112 --> 01:28:38,714
From nowhere.

1098
01:28:45,458 --> 01:28:48,332
Listen, I have to
meet someone now.

1099
01:28:48,625 --> 01:28:51,249
I'll call on you after.

1100
01:28:52,666 --> 01:28:54,707
We'll talk.

1101
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,999
Get you back on track. OK?

1102
01:29:05,166 --> 01:29:07,999
- OK?
- Thank you.

1103
01:29:09,375 --> 01:29:11,457
Thank you, Father.

1104
01:29:11,666 --> 01:29:12,957
Thank you.

1105
01:29:16,416 --> 01:29:18,665
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1106
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:17,957
Take your hands out of your pockets.
Slowly.

1107
01:30:18,458 --> 01:30:19,624
Why?

1108
01:30:19,691 --> 01:30:21,740
I heard you had a gun.

1109
01:30:25,666 --> 01:30:29,457
I have to say I'm surprised. Thought
I'd have to go looking for you.

1110
01:30:29,525 --> 01:30:32,374
Just 'cause I'm here doesn't mean
you have to go through with it.

1111
01:30:32,541 --> 01:30:34,207
Yes it does!

1112
01:30:35,458 --> 01:30:38,249
It's one of those cell
phone selling properties.

1113
01:30:39,416 --> 01:30:42,457
Did you ever think it would
come to this, though, huh?

1114
01:30:42,666 --> 01:30:46,082
I was hoping it wouldn't. I thought
you were a friend of mine.

1115
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:49,374
Your friend is just an enemy
you haven't made yet.

1116
01:30:49,541 --> 01:30:53,290
- Cheap cynicism.
- Not cheap, now, no.

1117
01:30:54,083 --> 01:30:56,874
It's a cynicism
that's been hard won!

1118
01:30:57,375 --> 01:30:59,432
It's a cynicism
that's been earned...

1119
01:30:59,457 --> 01:31:02,857
over a hell of a lot of physical
and psychological torture.

1120
01:31:04,208 --> 01:31:07,815
I take it back then. But
it's cynicism none the less.

1121
01:31:08,733 --> 01:31:10,949
Maybe that's the
difference between us.

1122
01:31:11,291 --> 01:31:13,332
Oh, that's not the
only difference.

1123
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:17,124
Any regrets?

1124
01:31:17,291 --> 01:31:19,749
Oh, yeah! Never got to
finish "Moby Dick".

1125
01:31:19,858 --> 01:31:22,040
- The whale kills Ahab.
- Is that right?

1126
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:25,832
Then he destroys the rest of the
ship and the crew along with it.

1127
01:31:26,083 --> 01:31:27,892
All except for Ishmael.

1128
01:31:28,973 --> 01:31:30,917
He alone escapes. To tell thee.

1129
01:31:35,791 --> 01:31:39,415
The burning of the
church I can understand.

1130
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:43,349
You didn't have to kill my dog.

1131
01:31:43,658 --> 01:31:47,540
I didn't kill your dog! I love dogs.
Why would I do a thing like that?

1132
01:31:47,708 --> 01:31:49,532
I found him with his throat cut.

1133
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:52,582
Why would I fucking kill a dog?
I didn't...

1134
01:31:52,750 --> 01:31:55,707
That had nothing to do with me.

1135
01:31:55,958 --> 01:31:58,332
I'm wholly innocent
of that crime.

1136
01:32:02,416 --> 01:32:05,915
I did give Veronica a bit of a
shove that one time, though.

1137
01:32:06,083 --> 01:32:09,082
I do admit that and
I'm sorry for it.

1138
01:32:13,833 --> 01:32:16,207
Did it upset you, the dog?

1139
01:32:16,541 --> 01:32:17,957
Yes, it did.

1140
01:32:18,125 --> 01:32:19,582
Did you cry?

1141
01:32:19,791 --> 01:32:20,915
Yes, I did.

1142
01:32:21,125 --> 01:32:23,040
That's nice.

1143
01:32:25,583 --> 01:32:29,832
And when you read what your fellow
priests did to all those poor children,

1144
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,999
all those years,
did you cry then?

1145
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:38,749
I asked you a question:
Did you cry then?

1146
01:32:39,666 --> 01:32:41,290
No.

1147
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:43,415
That's right!

1148
01:32:45,458 --> 01:32:47,790
- I suppose...
- What?

1149
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,290
- I suppose I felt attachment.
- Yeah.

1150
01:32:53,358 --> 01:32:54,957
- When you read...
- Yeah, yeah.

1151
01:32:55,125 --> 01:32:56,824
Something in a newspaper...

1152
01:33:03,791 --> 01:33:06,249
Detach yourself from that!

1153
01:33:09,875 --> 01:33:12,499
We were the lucky ones!

1154
01:33:12,708 --> 01:33:17,165
There's bodies burning back there!
Burning like dogs!

1155
01:33:21,375 --> 01:33:24,040
Don't look at me.

1156
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:27,249
Turn your face away,
don't look at me!

1157
01:33:31,041 --> 01:33:33,707
No! Run! Mícheál, run!

1158
01:33:33,916 --> 01:33:36,207
I'll get Stanton, Father!

1159
01:33:40,125 --> 01:33:42,832
He reminds me of me.

1160
01:33:48,083 --> 01:33:50,540
It's not too late, Jack.

1161
01:33:51,625 --> 01:33:53,707
Yes, it is.

1162
01:33:55,875 --> 01:33:58,332
Yes it is.

1163
01:33:59,916 --> 01:34:02,499
Say your prayers, Father.

1164
01:34:04,208 --> 01:34:06,124
I've already said them.
