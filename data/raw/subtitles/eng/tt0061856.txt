1
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,784
The radio won't work!

2
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:55,154
Why not?

3
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,653
We're getting abnormal interference!

4
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,320
From what? The storm?

5
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:05,896
It's more like a brain wave.

6
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:10,332
A brain wave?
How can that interfere with the radio?

7
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,904
What's that?

8
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:17,871
It's Godzilla!

9
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:20,444
Change course! Change course!

10
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,184
The interference is gone.

11
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:32,256
It's gone? How?

12
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,460
Maybe because we're out of its course.

13
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:35,924
Was Godzilla the cause?

14
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,463
No, the interference came from 7 o'clock.

15
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:41,293
Seven o'clock?

16
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,064
There's nothing there.

17
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,867
Wait a minute.
Here's a strange island.

18
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:52,205
- Sollgel Island.
- Sollgel? What's that?

19
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,539
Never heard of it, but look.

20
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,009
Godzilla's headed for that island.

21
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:59,048
Something must be calling him there.

22
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,153
What could be on Sollgel Island?

23
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,702
Shall we begin?

24
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,946
Go ahead.

25
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,523
Hello. Check party.

26
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:26,461
Stand by to check capsule two.

27
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,200
HQ listening. Over.

28
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,771
The time is 0836 hours.

29
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:37,502
Temperature, humidity,
same as at capsule one.

30
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:41,238
All other systems normal.

31
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:44,713
Don't be lazy!

32
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,146
It's the old man!

33
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,745
Oh, professor!

34
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,446
Each inspection is very important.

35
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,649
Don't be negligent.

36
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,521
Yes. Yes, sir.

37
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,502
That old man is hard to deal with.

38
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,199
He's not the only thing
that's hard to deal with.

39
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,340
This stupid heat.

40
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:18,009
I don't know how much more I can take.

41
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:23,185
Damn it. Again.

42
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,487
He's gone.

43
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,691
This isn't a place for men.

44
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:43,064
WFPO Sollgel Island

45
00:05:56,956 --> 00:06:00,551
- Did you report an irregularity?
- Yes.

46
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:03,093
- What's wrong?
- The bearing...

47
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:07,756
Replace it.
Everything needs to be perfect.

48
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:16,133
- Why did I come here?
- You volunteered.

49
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:21,747
Yes, it's a scientific honor...

50
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,382
...to work for
the great Professor Kusumi.

51
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,812
Then don't complain.

52
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:31,582
But I can't be as sharp as he demands
all the time.

53
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:35,922
- I miss Japanese food.
- Be patient.

54
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:45,300
- Interference.
- What? Again?

55
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:48,938
Locate the source!

56
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:53,839
Damn it. It's gone!

57
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:58,143
- Where did it come from?
- About 7 o'clock.

58
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:01,912
What could be causing the interference?

59
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,579
I have no idea.

60
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,322
What?

61
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,708
- That must be a care package.
- No.

62
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,940
Nobody knows about our plan
other than the WFPO.

63
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,779
Then it's a WFPO plane.

64
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,168
Hello there.

65
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,449
Thanks for coming to meet me.
My luggage is there.

66
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,816
Thanks a lot.

67
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,081
Who are you?

68
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:09,982
I'm Goro Maki...

69
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,991
...a freelance reporter.

70
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,059
Go home.

71
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,589
- That's ridiculous!
- You're ridiculous.

72
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:22,062
I'm not moving an inch
until I have a story.

73
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:24,964
I refuse.

74
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,989
- Do you still insist?
- Yes.

75
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:56,164
We don't need any publicity.

76
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,735
Who said I was doing this
for your publicity?

77
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:02,900
I'm working for myself.
The smell of a story...

78
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,475
- The smell of a story?
- Yes.

79
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:09,772
The smell of a story attracts me.

80
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,443
The readers will decide
whether to read it or not.

81
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,647
I report what I see.

82
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,516
Just like you, professor.

83
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:23,253
You'd do anything for your research.

84
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:24,794
Don't be silly.

85
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,231
How about this?

86
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,427
We can't just send him swimming home.

87
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:36,268
So why don't we have him help us.
We could use another man.

88
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:40,071
Even having him do the cooking
and cleaning would be a load off of us.

89
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,545
- Wait a minute!
- Would you rather swim home?

90
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,349
Well?

91
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:50,087
How long do you intend
to wear your life jacket?

92
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:59,489
You're one of us now.

93
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,826
Cook well.

94
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,578
- What's that sound?
- You'll see.

95
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,557
A huge mantis.

96
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:54,375
Keep out of the jungle at night!

97
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,440
Mr. Fujisaki!

98
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,576
Did you find the mantis?

99
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,574
- Mantis?
- Yes.

100
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:22,976
Concentrate on your cooking.

101
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:29,251
- Any news or fun?
- There's nothing fun here.

102
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,652
Mr. Furukawa's pretty frustrated.

103
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,022
Yeah, he is...

104
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,427
...but everyone's frustrated,
more or less.

105
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,691
Why?

106
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:45,359
We've been confined
on this eerie island for over a month.

107
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:49,838
I see. I'd like to hear
some of your eerie stories.

108
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:56,109
- What's that?
- Vegetables.

109
00:11:56,282 --> 00:12:00,616
- That's the bath!
- I know. Nobody's bathed yet.

110
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:04,244
Morio was washing those
in there this morning.

111
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,127
Hey.

112
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,761
What are we having tonight?

113
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:20,033
- Dehydrated vegetables again?
- They've been specially seasoned.

114
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:23,869
- Feed us some fresh ones.
- Are there fresh vegetables here?

115
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,274
Sure. We call it Sollgel parsley.

116
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:33,383
There's not a lot left around camp,
but you'll find a lot in the jungle.

117
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:02,399
The weather conditions
are becoming favorable, sir.

118
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:05,271
This low pressure here worries me.

119
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,241
It shouldn't be a problem.

120
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:12,316
The area of high pressure
will push it north.

121
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:16,648
In other words, tomorrow may be
the perfect day to run our experiment.

122
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,121
Professor?

123
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:24,819
An experiment to freeze this island?

124
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,760
Wait and see.

125
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:32,226
- What about the native girl?
- A girl?

126
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:35,170
There are no natives.

127
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,935
I saw a young girl.

128
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,806
But we've checked thoroughly.

129
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,613
You could've missed her.

130
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:47,149
- Help her.
- Enough!

131
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,950
Don't interfere with us.

132
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,621
I just want to get this experiment
over with and get out of here!

133
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:10,334
Professor, is this experiment
so important?

134
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,309
It is.

135
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:16,240
Mankind's future depends on it.

136
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:23,452
As you know, the world population
is reaching a limit.

137
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,892
You know why?

138
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:32,564
The food supply. There won't be
enough food to feed the population.

139
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:37,300
So we must start thinking
about currently uncultivated lands.

140
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:42,707
The Siberian tundras, the African
deserts, the South American jungles...

141
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,139
They're useless now.

142
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:50,872
But if we can control the weather
and make those lands fertile...

143
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,745
...we can avoid mass starvation.

144
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,921
Is that possible?

145
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,715
Theoretically, yes.

146
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,422
That's what we're experimenting.

147
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,954
I have one question.

148
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,932
Why must the experiment
be conducted in secret?

149
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,632
Don't you see?

150
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,329
If someone abused our system,
they could also freeze the entire world.

151
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,608
The results would be the same
as a nuclear holocaust.

152
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:24,413
We'll conduct the experiment tomorrow.
Everybody, be on standby.

153
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:16,757
No wind, few clouds.

154
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:21,338
Temperature 34 degrees Celsius,
humidity 60 percent.

155
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,269
Twenty minutes before launch!

156
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,598
- Five minutes before launch.
- The reporter?

157
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:57,605
- I thought he was around.
- Alert him.

158
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,773
Two minutes before launch.

159
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,414
Return immediately, Maki.

160
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,257
Hey! Come out!

161
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:27,263
Come out, quickly! Please!

162
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,306
Thirty seconds before launch!

163
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,513
Ten seconds...

164
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,416
...nine, eight...

165
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:48,720
...seven, six, five, four, three...

166
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,727
...two, one. Launch.

167
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,592
Launch freezing balloon.

168
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:05,236
Refrigeration gas,
negative 115 degrees Celsius.

169
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:18,484
The balloon's altitude, 350 meters.

170
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,049
Four hundred.

171
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,188
- Detonate it at 800.
- Five hundred.

172
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:30,229
Six hundred.

173
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,861
Six hundred fifty.

174
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,101
Seven hundred.

175
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,277
Seven hundred fifty.

176
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:44,045
- Eight hundred.
- Detonate.

177
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:57,921
Warm air is ascending, sir.

178
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,559
Capsules, standby.

179
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,138
Release silver iodide.

180
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,581
Damn it!

181
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:32,488
The temperature has descended
to 29 degrees Celsius.

182
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:36,161
So far, so good.
Just as we calculated.

183
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:40,431
- Has Maki returned?
- He'll come back shivering.

184
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:44,201
Temperature falling rapidly.
It's currently at 25 degrees Celsius.

185
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:49,474
Stop cooling. Stand by for heating.

186
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:52,139
Launch the radioactive balloon.

187
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,434
The radio controls aren't responding.

188
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,495
Professor!

189
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:18,905
- We can't control the capsules!
- What's the cause? The cause?

190
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:21,802
We're getting interference.

191
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:26,378
- Can we get the balloon back?
- No, sir.

192
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:28,712
If it explodes too soon...

193
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,151
We'll get a reverse reaction.

194
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:34,417
The upper atmosphere
will work like a convex lens.

195
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:37,618
- Are the controls working now?
- No good.

196
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:53,237
Thus, sunlight converged
on Sollgel Island.

197
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:57,815
The temperature rose
to 70 degrees Celsius.

198
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:12,019
Then came the thunderstorms.

199
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:17,134
Hot rain came in torrents.

200
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:42,454
Four days later, it finally cooled
to 37 degrees Celsius.

201
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:48,856
Tell all the men...

202
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:58,874
- At last, it cooled a little.
- We were nearly baked.

203
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:04,509
- So the experiment is over.
- I don't think so.

204
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,851
I know the old man well.

205
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:11,455
He's encouraged by hardships.

206
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:18,754
Everyone, over here!

207
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,025
A message from the professor.

208
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:27,797
We are to do a systems check
and damage reports immediately.

209
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,833
Is the experiment still on?

210
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:33,944
He didn't say.
He only ordered a systems check.

211
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:59,932
- At the inlet down there.
- What?

212
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,266
A girl was swimming.

213
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:06,435
With that heat, she's sure to be dead now.

214
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,806
Don't you believe me?

215
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,073
You might have been hallucinating.

216
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:13,684
Professor!

217
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,692
Professor, how did it get that big?

218
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:35,429
Maybe because of the heat
and radioactivity.

219
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:38,472
Let's go back.

220
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:45,982
Damn it.

221
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:52,379
Capsule one is over there.
We'll call for help from there.

222
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:07,800
It's out!

223
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:17,776
Get inside.

224
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,527
Professor!

225
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,959
Professor, what are they doing?

226
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,493
The interference waves we got
came from over there.

227
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,861
An egg!

228
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:54,236
According to the reports,
we can finish the repairs in 10 days.

229
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,381
- In addition...
- I object! I object.

230
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,279
We can't continue...

231
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:05,853
Who are opposed?

232
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:12,021
Professor, you should
continue your research.

233
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:14,722
You have no say.
You're not a member of this team!

234
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:17,766
You must be kidding me.
I was admitted as a cook.

235
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,166
Hold it. Fighting won't do any good.

236
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:24,138
Furukawa, we can't get off this island.

237
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:29,644
The heat ruined our radio.
We can't even call for a rescue ship.

238
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,213
How soon can you fix it?

239
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:34,352
I'm not sure yet,
but it could take a while.

240
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:40,986
Continue the repairs in the morning.

241
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,252
Meeting adjourned.

242
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,567
You're pretty good.

243
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:04,374
- I know you broke the radio.
- Well...

244
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:11,682
- The kitchen!
- What's happening?

245
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:22,860
- What is it?
- My shirt is gone.

246
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:26,394
Something's on a tree.

247
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:29,836
Light the tree behind me.

248
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,638
No!

249
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:40,545
You saw her, didn't you?
That's the girl I saw.

250
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,279
I'm impressed that she's still alive.

251
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:52,123
Kamacuras?

252
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:55,755
The mutant mantis.
Maki named them last night.

253
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:59,631
Journalists are good at naming things.

254
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:04,707
Morio, what kind of egg
do you think that is?

255
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:07,770
I have no idea.

256
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:19,480
It's being cracked!

257
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:42,736
It broke open!

258
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,919
A baby Godzilla!

259
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,397
What an unfair fight!

260
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,122
Watch out!

261
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,486
- What's going on?
- He insists on going home.

262
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,690
Furukawa, have you gone mad?

263
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:50,174
What's wrong with you?

264
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:55,050
What's wrong?

265
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:11,368
It's Godzilla!

266
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,804
Come on!

267
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:28,075
Everybody, run!
Godzilla is coming!

268
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,556
Quick! Over there!

269
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,232
- Godzilla's come to help!
- Wait a minute.

270
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,004
The radio interference was the baby's cry.

271
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,040
All right!

272
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:06,183
No time to cheer. Let's get out
of here before we get hurt.

273
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:33,004
That way!

274
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:57,981
Over here. Come on.

275
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,793
This will pep you up.

276
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:36,550
It's you.

277
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,890
- You thief.
- Thief?

278
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,454
Are you Japanese?

279
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:50,260
- But I'm not a thief.
- You're stealing my things!

280
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:53,835
You're the thief.
This is my shirt.

281
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:58,699
You lie! Boys don't wear red shirts
like this. Or are you a girl?

282
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:04,480
I'm a boy. My name's Goro.
And yours?

283
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:06,114
Saeko.

284
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:08,447
Saeko, huh?

285
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:12,749
I'm with the scientists.
I'm not a thief.

286
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:16,625
I'm not a thief either. Here.

287
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:21,062
- You can keep it.
- Really?

288
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:23,526
You'll really give it to me?

289
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:34,140
But what are you doing on an island,
all alone like this?

290
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:49,186
The radio's really out of order this time.

291
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,726
Well, let's check the other equipment.

292
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,895
Listen, everybody.

293
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,458
From now on...

294
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:01,594
The reporter! Are you all right?
We were worried.

295
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:03,069
Sorry.

296
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,073
Professor, I want you to meet someone.

297
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:08,676
Come on.

298
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:23,555
This is Ms. Saeko Matsumiya.

299
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:25,286
Matsumiya?

300
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:28,990
Take a look at this.
Her father was an archaeologist.

301
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:34,299
"1955, Sollgel Island,
Tadashi Matsumiya."

302
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:35,996
- Matsumiya?
- Do you know him?

303
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:40,667
No. But 20 years ago, when the
Japanese pulled out of the Pacific...

304
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:44,508
...there was an archaeologist who
stayed behind on one of the islands.

305
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,843
That's right.
It was Dr. Matsumiya.

306
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:49,679
He died on this island seven years ago.

307
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:52,282
And your mother?

308
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,588
She died when I was born.

309
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,251
Oh, I see.

310
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:00,795
Well, you've done very well alone here.

311
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:03,657
It's Kamacuras!

312
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,750
Hurry up! lt'll ruin the equipment.

313
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,650
- You've got to head it off.
- Right!

314
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:27,552
This way!

315
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,323
All right, it's gone.

316
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:15,598
It's too dangerous to stay here.

317
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,103
How about this?

318
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:21,574
Why don't we move
the equipment into her cave.

319
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:22,734
- A cave?
- Yes.

320
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:26,144
It's safer and cooler than here.

321
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,842
That's how she survived that intense heat.

322
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:32,854
All right, let's go.

323
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:34,615
- Right.
- Hurry up.

324
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:54,896
Goro, you gave up!
And you call yourself a man.

325
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:56,362
What do you mean?

326
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:59,468
There's not a man in Tokyo
who can run faster than you.

327
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,299
Tokyo? What kind of place is it?

328
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,236
What kind of place?

329
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:06,936
Well, it's a man-made jungle.

330
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:09,079
Jungle?

331
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,412
- Goro, are you going back there?
- Yeah.

332
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:17,482
- You'll come too.
- Really?

333
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:22,183
- It was your father's home.
- Oh, wonderful!

334
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,958
Saeko! It's Godzilla!

335
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:39,974
It's all right. He's only a baby.
We're friends.

336
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:42,606
Hey, come back!

337
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:45,240
It's really harmless.

338
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,093
See?

339
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:30,720
Saeko! It's the big one!

340
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,476
Fujisaki.

341
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:24,876
What's a Kumonga?

342
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:26,640
Kumonga?

343
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:31,210
I'm reading Matsumiya's notes
and that name keeps popping up.

344
00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:34,516
Kumonga?
I have absolutely no idea.

345
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:41,959
Morio.

346
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:45,226
I feel so hot.
My body is burning up!

347
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:49,796
Professor, he's got a high fever.

348
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:53,272
Everybody's got it. They're outside.

349
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:03,386
- Tashiro, what's the matter?
- I'm hot.

350
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:07,586
Furukawa, what happened?

351
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:10,823
- They've all got a high fever.
- Let's get them inside.

352
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,791
All right, come on.

353
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,614
We're all out of medicine.

354
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:42,557
It's some kind of tropical disease.

355
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:44,455
What do we do?

356
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:46,596
We may get it too.

357
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:49,197
I know something to make them better.

358
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,994
- What is it?
- The warm, red water.

359
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:54,069
- Warm, red water?
- Yes.

360
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:56,900
If you drink it, the fever will go away.

361
00:47:57,074 --> 00:47:59,736
- All right, I'll go get it.
- You can't.

362
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:02,242
That's where Godzilla is.

363
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:05,139
And on the way, you must pass
Kumonga's valley.

364
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:07,977
Saeko, just what is this "Kumonga"?

365
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:10,711
It's a giant spider.

366
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:14,555
Godzilla and his baby, Kamacuras
and now Kumonga.

367
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,124
This is a monster island.

368
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:18,318
But Kumonga is sleeping now.

369
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:21,055
If we don't wake him up,
we won't have any trouble.

370
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,096
I'll leave now.

371
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:24,995
Wait.

372
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:28,164
You can't go out there alone.

373
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:29,896
- Don't worry.
- I'll go with you.

374
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,472
Goro.

375
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:33,473
According to
Dr. Matsumiya's notes...

376
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:36,408
...the web of the Kumonga
can only be cut by heat.

377
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,842
By heat?

378
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:40,575
- It's a good thing to know.
- I understand.

379
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,343
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

380
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,851
Goro. Take a gun with you.

381
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,416
Be careful.
This is where Kumonga lives.

382
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:19,146
Where Kumonga lives?

383
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:28,822
- Well, where is it?
- Underground, sleeping.

384
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:37,597
Be careful!

385
00:50:25,322 --> 00:50:27,187
This is going to be dangerous.

386
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:34,329
Damn it, he knows we're here.

387
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:37,558
No, he's educating his son.

388
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:39,901
He's educating it?

389
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:05,058
Just like the education fanatics in Japan.

390
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,093
What's that?

391
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:09,531
They don't let their children play.

392
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:12,065
Poor kids.

393
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,302
Perhaps.

394
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:17,593
The baby spit fire?

395
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:22,664
Yes, it's growing really fast.

396
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:37,676
Furukawa!

397
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:44,548
- Watch out!
- I'm going home!

398
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,348
Stop it!

399
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,548
Give me the gun!

400
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:54,926
Professor, are you all right?

401
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:57,293
I'm fine. It's just a scratch.

402
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:12,781
- Does it hurt?
- No.

403
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:15,417
I'll get you herbs tomorrow.

404
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:16,984
Thank you.

405
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:27,563
Fujisaki, you'd better repair
the radio soon.

406
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:29,926
Professor, you mean...?

407
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:35,963
With things the way they are now,
we must give up the experiment.

408
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:57,590
The red water was really effective.

409
00:54:57,761 --> 00:54:59,695
Everyone is cured.

410
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:02,832
They're still a little woozy,
but their fevers are gone.

411
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:06,298
That's good.
How is Furukawa?

412
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:09,370
Well, he regrets what he did.

413
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:12,166
Where's Saeko?

414
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:15,334
She went to get herbs for me.

415
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,048
Saeko!

416
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:21,728
Saeko! Come on!

417
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:39,181
Let's run for it.

418
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:23,216
Let's go.

419
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:35,365
- It's Kumonga!
- Come on!

420
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:11,163
That's it!

421
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:25,744
Between those rocks!

422
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:24,008
Saeko, climb up!

423
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:17,823
Quietly.

424
01:02:30,546 --> 01:02:32,537
Oh, it's the professor.

425
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:36,348
What are you doing, sir?

426
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,282
Oh, you two.

427
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:42,754
Changing the melted cords,
but it's very hard.

428
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:46,918
You haven't give up, have you?

429
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:50,896
Would you just loaf if there were no news?

430
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:54,002
No, I'd have to do something.

431
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:56,070
It's the same with me.

432
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,871
We have a poor nature.

433
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:10,085
Lie down and hide!

434
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:26,633
Is that Kumonga?

435
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,737
That was close.

436
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:03,603
Dinner will be ready soon.

437
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:05,536
Oh, good.

438
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:08,709
- Everyone, come quick!
- What's wrong?

439
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:10,778
- We can't get out.
- What?

440
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:13,472
Kumonga's outside spinning a web!

441
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:25,943
Has it given up, professor?

442
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:30,957
No, it's waiting for us to come out.

443
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:35,589
It's fixed! The radio is repaired!

444
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,290
Send an S.O.S.

445
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:41,034
- We can't.
- Why not?

446
01:05:41,203 --> 01:05:43,296
We have to put the antenna outside.

447
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:45,599
Damn it!

448
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:49,037
We can go out.

449
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:51,475
- Really?
- Yes.

450
01:05:52,915 --> 01:05:55,645
This tunnel opens to the sea.

451
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:00,050
We can swim outside.

452
01:06:00,222 --> 01:06:05,091
So that's how you disappeared that time.

453
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:08,658
- I'll go.
- Me too.

454
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:11,060
All right.

455
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:43,391
Look.

456
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:50,228
Let's hurry.

457
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:56,239
- Keep away!
- Go back!

458
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:03,617
Come on.

459
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:48,891
Watch out.

460
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,951
Look out, Morio!

461
01:08:18,494 --> 01:08:20,928
Move over there. Quickly.

462
01:08:29,505 --> 01:08:31,166
Morio, be careful!

463
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:33,197
- What's going on?
- It's bad.

464
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:35,935
Kumonga and Godzilla's son are fighting!

465
01:08:37,146 --> 01:08:40,809
If the father comes,
this cave will be crushed!

466
01:08:46,188 --> 01:08:48,656
Let's start the experiment.

467
01:08:49,325 --> 01:08:52,522
- We can't move anyway.
- But...

468
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:56,329
Let's freeze the monsters.

469
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:58,194
All right?

470
01:08:58,367 --> 01:08:59,959
But will it work?

471
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:02,866
Let's hope so.

472
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:14,038
We still have enough material left.

473
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:16,275
We made contact.

474
01:09:17,286 --> 01:09:21,416
A rescue ship has been sent to us.

475
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:24,925
How about the experiment?

476
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:26,561
Let's do it.

477
01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:30,827
All of you, will you do it?

478
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:38,731
Hurry to your posts.

479
01:10:16,845 --> 01:10:19,507
All right, let's get started.

480
01:10:20,849 --> 01:10:22,214
What should we do?

481
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:24,511
Let's get the lifeboat ready.

482
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:41,999
Now, one, two, three!

483
01:10:44,306 --> 01:10:48,504
Freezing unit ready to go.
Electric generators standing by.

484
01:10:51,146 --> 01:10:52,374
How is the weather?

485
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:56,177
We can't wait around,
but it doesn't look too bad.

486
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,854
Starting the countdown.

487
01:11:01,056 --> 01:11:03,286
Minus 180 seconds.

488
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:41,957
Sixty seconds.

489
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:01,779
Minus 10 seconds.

490
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:06,653
Nine, eight, seven, six...

491
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:09,586
...five, four, three...

492
01:12:09,758 --> 01:12:11,692
...two, one.

493
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:14,191
Launch the refrigeration balloon.

494
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:34,305
Five hundred, 550.

495
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:37,047
Six hundred.

496
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:39,153
Six-fifty.

497
01:12:40,322 --> 01:12:42,415
Seven hundred.

498
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:45,090
Detonate the unit.

499
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:54,130
Release silver iodide.

500
01:13:31,273 --> 01:13:33,537
Ready the radioactive unit.
Launch.

501
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:09,008
- Interference.
- Not again.

502
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:17,210
- How's the remote control working?
- No trouble yet.

503
01:14:31,533 --> 01:14:33,865
The interference is gone.

504
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:39,463
Either Godzilla's given up or he's
been killed by the other monsters.

505
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:43,975
- Detonate capsule at 1000 meters.
- Roger.

506
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:11,457
- Altitude?
- Six hundred fifty.

507
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:15,165
Seven hundred.

508
01:16:52,341 --> 01:16:54,866
It's at 900.

509
01:16:57,179 --> 01:16:59,613
Nine hundred fifty.

510
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:04,479
One thousand.

511
01:17:04,653 --> 01:17:06,245
All right, detonate!

512
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:13,355
Saeko, look.
It seems to be a success.

513
01:17:15,998 --> 01:17:18,933
The temperature has fallen
three degrees Celsius.

514
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:23,037
No, five degrees.
It's going down fast.

515
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:25,903
We've done it.

516
01:17:29,711 --> 01:17:30,973
Professor!

517
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,379
The monsters have moved away.

518
01:17:36,551 --> 01:17:39,884
That means we can leave!

519
01:18:25,634 --> 01:18:27,932
The temperature
is negative 5 degrees Celsius.

520
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:31,364
- Switch to automatic control.
- Roger.

521
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:34,641
All right, let's get to the beach.

522
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:44,485
Hurry!

523
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:28,623
Hey, it's snowing!

524
01:19:30,799 --> 01:19:32,892
It's snow!

525
01:19:41,543 --> 01:19:43,534
Professor...

526
01:19:47,349 --> 01:19:48,782
Professor!

527
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:55,546
All right, let's move on out.

528
01:24:00,602 --> 01:24:02,797
Poor Godzilla.

529
01:24:04,339 --> 01:24:07,536
They won't die.
They'll just hibernate.

530
01:24:07,909 --> 01:24:09,433
Hibernate?

531
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:12,171
They'll sleep until the snow melts.

532
01:24:27,462 --> 01:24:29,362
Anybody see the ship?

533
01:24:32,634 --> 01:24:34,192
Hey, what's that?

534
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:37,799
It's coming this way!

535
01:24:47,849 --> 01:24:50,249
Hey, it's the ship!

536
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:53,114
Why didn't they tell us
they were sending a submarine?

537
01:24:53,288 --> 01:24:55,085
They scared me half to death!

538
01:25:15,210 --> 01:25:19,544
They'll live peacefully
after the snow melts.

539
