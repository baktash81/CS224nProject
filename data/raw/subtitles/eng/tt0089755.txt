I'm broke, too, you know?

1033
01:56:56,468 --> 01:57:00,006
I wouldn't ask, but tips were a bit light.

1034
01:57:03,766 --> 01:57:06,883
-Are you all right?
-If I get a decent crop. 

1035
01:57:09,481 --> 01:57:11,142
I could shoot him.

-I did.

that was like me?.

1364
02:33:33,663 --> 02:33:38,032
Or will the eagles
of the Ngong Hills look out for me?. 

1365
02:33:50,930 --> 02:33:53,262
You cannot come where I'm going.

1366
02:33:53,349 --> 02:33:56,056
There is no cooking where you are going?

1367
02:33:57,269 --> 02:33:59,260
You would not like it there.

1368
02:34:00,189 --> 02:34:02,271
You must trust me about this.

1369
02:34:24,755 --> 02:34:27,872
KAREN: Letters you can send on
to this address in Denmark. 

1370
02:34:28,259 --> 02:34:32,047
When you sell the car, if you would
send the check to Hunter & Company, 

1371
02:34:32,138 --> 02:34:34,800
and anything else
you don't know what to do with. 

1372
02:34:34,932 --> 02:34:36,297
Yes, ma'am.

1373
02:34:39,562 --> 02:34:42,725
I've been sent to ask
if we may stand you a drink. 

1374
02:34:43,482 --> 02:34:44,813
Who is "we"?

1375
02:34:46,152 --> 02:34:47,938
The members actually.

1376
02:34:51,824 --> 02:34:53,234
All right.

1377
02:35:09,300 --> 02:35:10,915
Whiskey, please.

1378
02:35:12,261 --> 02:35:14,001
Two whiskeys, please.

1379
02:35:40,039 --> 02:35:43,372
Rose-lipt maidens, lightfoot lads.

1380
02:35:44,043 --> 02:35:45,874
ALL: Hear, hear!

1381
02:35:54,386 --> 02:35:55,717
Thank you.

1382
02:36:04,563 --> 02:36:06,554
KAREN: This is very dear to me.

1383
02:36:09,109 --> 02:36:11,395
It has helped me to find my way.

1384
02:36:13,030 --> 02:36:14,611
Thank you, msabu.

1385
02:36:31,423 --> 02:36:33,709
I want to hear you say my name.

1386
02:36:36,929 --> 02:36:38,794
You are Karen.

1387
02:36:53,279 --> 02:36:55,270
KAREN: The mail has come today,

1388
02:36:55,614 --> 02:36:58,026
and a friend writes this to me,

1389
02:36:59,618 --> 02:37:03,952
"The Masai have reported
to the district commissioner at Ngong 

1390
02:37:05,165 --> 02:37:09,124
"that many times at sunrise and sunset

1391
02:37:10,129 --> 02:37:14,213
"they have seen lions
on Finch Hatton 's grave. 

1392
02:37:15,467 --> 02:37:18,129
"A lion and a lioness have come there

1393
02:37:18,971 --> 02:37:23,556
"and stood, or lain
on the grave for a long time. 

1394
02:37:25,561 --> 02:37:27,392
"After you went away,

1395
02:37:27,646 --> 02:37:32,140
"the ground around the grave
was leveled out into a sort of terrace. 

1396
02:37:33,527 --> 02:37:38,647
"I suppose that the level place
makes a good site for the lions. 

1397
02:37:39,366 --> 02:37:42,824
"From there they have a view
over the plain, 

1398
02:37:43,370 --> 02:37:46,533
"and the cattle and game on it. "

1399
02:37:49,293 --> 02:37:51,329
Denys will like that.

1400
02:37:52,338 --> 02:37:54,454
I must remember to tell him.
