1
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,965
Our pasta this evening is
squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth...

2
00:02:24,304 --> 00:02:28,053
...with goat cheese profiteroles.
And I also have an arugula Caesar salad.

3
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:31,427
For entrees, I have swordfish meatloaf
with onion marmalade.

4
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,138
Rare roasted partridge breast
in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale.

5
00:02:35,232 --> 00:02:38,316
And grilled free range rabbit
with herb french fries.

6
00:02:38,527 --> 00:02:42,110
Our pasta tonight is a squid ravioli
in a lemon grass broth...

7
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:50,036
God, I hate this place.
It's a chick's restaurant.

8
00:02:50,164 --> 00:02:51,195
Why not Dorsia?

9
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,959
Because Bateman won't give
the maître d' head.

10
00:02:56,962 --> 00:02:58,456
Is that Reed Robinson?

11
00:02:58,547 --> 00:03:01,299
- You freebasing? That's not Robinson.
- Who is it then?

12
00:03:01,383 --> 00:03:03,957
- That's Paul Allen.
- That's not Paul Allen.

13
00:03:04,303 --> 00:03:07,304
- Paul Allen's on the other side of the room.
- Who's he with?

14
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:09,133
Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.

15
00:03:09,225 --> 00:03:11,098
Can't do coke in this bathroom.

16
00:03:11,185 --> 00:03:13,758
- Are you sure that's Paul Allen?
- Yes, McDufus.

17
00:03:13,854 --> 00:03:15,562
He handles the Fisher account.

18
00:03:15,648 --> 00:03:17,771
- Lucky bastard.
- Lucky Jew bastard.

19
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,272
What does that have to do with anything?

20
00:03:20,361 --> 00:03:23,730
I've seen that bastard in his office
on the phone with CEO's...

21
00:03:23,823 --> 00:03:27,571
...spinning a fucking menorah.
- Not a menorah. You spin a dreidel.

22
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,610
Oh, my God, do you want me to fry you up
some fucking potato pancakes?

23
00:03:31,706 --> 00:03:33,745
- Some latkes?
- No. Just...

24
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,665
...cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.

25
00:03:36,752 --> 00:03:39,789
I forgot. Bateman's dating someone
from the ACLU.

26
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,509
The voice of reason. The boy next door.

27
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,753
Speaking of reasonable...

28
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:47,340
...only $570.

29
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:49,462
Not bad.

30
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:35,010
Two Stoli on the rocks.

31
00:04:35,145 --> 00:04:37,932
These aren't good any more.
It's a cash bar.

32
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:41,191
That will be $25.

33
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:46,360
You're a fucking ugly bitch.

34
00:04:46,823 --> 00:04:50,655
I want to stab you to death
and play around with your blood.

35
00:05:29,158 --> 00:05:32,444
I live in the American Gardens Building
on West 81st Street...

36
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:34,114
... on the 11th floor.

37
00:05:35,122 --> 00:05:38,491
My name is Patrick Bateman.
I'm 27 years old.

38
00:05:40,503 --> 00:05:42,828
I believe in taking care of myself...

39
00:05:42,964 --> 00:05:46,249
... in a balanced diet
and a rigorous exercise routine.

40
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,965
In the morning, if my face is a little puffy...

41
00:05:50,054 --> 00:05:53,388
... l'll put on an ice pack
while doing my stomach crunches.

42
00:05:53,474 --> 00:05:54,968
I can do 1,000 now.

43
00:06:12,452 --> 00:06:16,236
After I remove the ice pack,
I use a deep pore cleanser lotion.

44
00:06:16,873 --> 00:06:20,289
In the shower,
I use a water-activated gel cleanser...

45
00:06:22,337 --> 00:06:24,662
... then, a honey-almond body scrub...

46
00:06:25,173 --> 00:06:28,091
... and on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub.

47
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:40,517
Then, I apply a herb mint facial mask...

48
00:06:40,605 --> 00:06:44,817
... which I leave on for 10 minutes,
while I prepare the rest of my routine.

49
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,193
I always use an aftershave lotion
with little or no alcohol...

50
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:54,984
... because alcohol dries your face out
and makes you look older...

51
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,829
... then, moisturiser...

52
00:06:57,122 --> 00:06:59,115
... then, an anti-ageing eye balm...

53
00:06:59,207 --> 00:07:02,292
... followed by
a final moisturising protective lotion.

54
00:07:04,004 --> 00:07:06,542
There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman...

55
00:07:07,424 --> 00:07:11,125
... some kind of abstraction,
but there is no real me...

56
00:07:11,637 --> 00:07:14,210
... only an entity, something illusory.

57
00:07:14,973 --> 00:07:17,262
And though I can hide my cold gaze...

58
00:07:17,351 --> 00:07:20,387
... and you can shake my hand
and feel flesh gripping yours...

59
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,477
... and maybe you can even sense
our lifestyles are probably comparable...

60
00:07:25,484 --> 00:07:28,485
... I simply am not there.

61
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,597
Morning, Hamilton. Nice tan.

62
00:08:02,522 --> 00:08:05,439
- Late?
- Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?

63
00:08:05,691 --> 00:08:09,226
Ricky Harrison cancelled. He didn't say
what he was cancelling or why.

64
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,736
I occasionally box with Ricky
at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?

65
00:08:12,824 --> 00:08:15,493
Spencer wants to meet for drinks
at Fluties Pier 17.

66
00:08:15,576 --> 00:08:17,035
- When?
- After 6:00.

67
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,448
Negative. Cancel it.

68
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:20,863
- And what should I say?
- Just say no.

69
00:08:21,124 --> 00:08:22,322
Just say no?

70
00:08:23,251 --> 00:08:24,414
Okay, Jean.

71
00:08:25,003 --> 00:08:27,576
I need reservations for three at Camols...

72
00:08:27,714 --> 00:08:29,671
...at 12:30 and if not, try Crayons.

73
00:08:29,758 --> 00:08:31,300
- All right?
- Yes sir.

74
00:08:32,343 --> 00:08:35,048
Wait. And I need reservations for two...

75
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,587
...at Arcadia at 8:00 on Thursday.

76
00:08:38,808 --> 00:08:40,303
Something romantic?

77
00:08:40,477 --> 00:08:41,508
No.

78
00:08:43,396 --> 00:08:44,428
Silly.

79
00:08:44,981 --> 00:08:47,389
- Forget it. I'll make them.
- No, I'll do it.

80
00:08:47,484 --> 00:08:50,687
No. Be a doll and just get me
a mineral water, okay?

81
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,031
- You look nice today.
- Don't wear that outfit again.

82
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,659
What? I didn't hear you.

83
00:08:56,743 --> 00:08:59,317
I said, "Do not wear that outfit again."

84
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,654
Wear a dress. A skirt or something.

85
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,615
- You don't like this, I take it?
- Come on...

86
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,667
...you're prettier than that.

87
00:09:06,962 --> 00:09:08,337
Thanks, Patrick.

88
00:09:08,797 --> 00:09:11,466
I'm not here. And high heels.

89
00:09:12,092 --> 00:09:13,503
I like high heels.

90
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,039
Hundreds, thousands of roses.

91
00:09:46,293 --> 00:09:50,872
And lots of chocolate truffles. Godiva.
And oysters on the half shell.

92
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,503
I'm listening
to the new Robert Palmer tape...

93
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:56,926
... but Evelyn, my supposed fiancée,
keeps buzzing in my ear.

94
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,258
Photographers.

95
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,261
Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz.

96
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,347
And we'll have to get someone
to videotape it.

97
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,721
Patrick, we should do it.

98
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,482
Do what?

99
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,646
- Get married.
- No. I can't take the time off work.

100
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,738
Your father owns the company.
You can do anything, silly.

101
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,824
- I don't want to talk about it.
- You hate that job anyway.

102
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,867
I don't see why you just don't quit.

103
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,536
Because I want to fit in.

104
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,631
Williams' party.

105
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:41,179
I'm on the verge of tears
by the time we arrive at Espace...

106
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:44,302
... since I'm positive
we won't have a decent table.

107
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,634
But we do.

108
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:49,229
And relief washes over me
in an awesome wave.

109
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,852
This is my cousin,
Vanden, and her boyfriend, Stash.

110
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:56,150
- They're both artists.
- The menu is in braille.

111
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:07,405
I'm fairly certain that Timothy Bryce
and Evelyn are having an affair.

112
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,873
Timothy is the only interesting person
I know.

113
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:14,539
I'm almost completely indifferent
as to whether Evelyn knows...

114
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:17,587
... l'm having an affair
with Courtney Rawlinson...

115
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,761
... her closest friend.

116
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,220
Courtney is almost perfect looking.

117
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:25,345
She usually operates
on one or more psychiatric drugs.

118
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,428
Tonight, I believe it's Xanax.

119
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,846
More disturbing than her drug use,
though...

120
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,894
... is the fact that she's engaged
to Luis Carruthers.

121
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,360
- The biggest dufus in the business.
- Tell me, Stash...

122
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,566
...do you think Soho is becoming
too commercial?

123
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:42,367
Yes, I read that.

124
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:44,119
Who gives a rat's ass?

125
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:45,575
That affects us.

126
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,906
What about the massacres
in Sri Lanka, honey?

127
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:52,251
Doesn't that affect us too?
Do you know anything about Sri Lanka?

128
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:54,745
The Sikhs are killing tons of Israelis.

129
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,838
Come on, Bryce. There are a lot more
important problems than Sri Lanka...

130
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:00,588
...to worry about.
- Like what?

131
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,087
We have to end apartheid for one.

132
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:06,048
And slow down the nuclear arms race.

133
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:08,848
Stop terrorism and world hunger.

134
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:12,598
We have to provide food and shelter
for the homeless.

135
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:16,726
And oppose racial discrimination
and promote civil rights...

136
00:12:16,988 --> 00:12:19,739
...while also promoting equal rights
for women.

137
00:12:20,158 --> 00:12:22,281
We have to encourage a return...

138
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:25,786
...to traditional, moral values.

139
00:12:26,456 --> 00:12:30,750
Most importantly, we have to promote
general social concern.

140
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:34,412
And less materialism in young people.

141
00:12:36,382 --> 00:12:37,497
Patrick...

142
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:40,420
...how thought provoking.

143
00:13:16,757 --> 00:13:17,788
Hello.

144
00:13:19,926 --> 00:13:20,958
Hello.

145
00:13:40,948 --> 00:13:43,699
Bleaching? Are you trying
to say bleaching? Oh, my God.

146
00:13:43,784 --> 00:13:47,117
Two things. One. You can't bleach
a Cerruti. Out of the question.

147
00:13:47,204 --> 00:13:49,660
Two. I can only get these sheets
in Santa Fe.

148
00:13:49,748 --> 00:13:52,500
These are very expensive sheets
and I need them clean.

149
00:13:52,584 --> 00:13:55,621
If you don't shut your fucking mouth,
I will kill you.

150
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,333
I'm having lunch at Hubert's
in 20 minutes with Ronald Harrison.

151
00:13:59,425 --> 00:14:03,553
I need those sheets cleaned this afternoon.
Listen, I cannot understand you!

152
00:14:03,637 --> 00:14:06,342
This is crazy. You're a fool.
I can't cope with this.

153
00:14:06,432 --> 00:14:08,306
Stupid bleaching! Understand!

154
00:14:09,477 --> 00:14:10,508
Patrick?

155
00:14:11,062 --> 00:14:14,347
- Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
- Hello.

156
00:14:15,232 --> 00:14:18,815
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way
up here, but they're the best.

157
00:14:18,903 --> 00:14:20,942
Then why can't they get the stains out?

158
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,944
I mean, can you talk to these people
or something? I'm not getting anywhere.

159
00:14:25,034 --> 00:14:26,314
What are those?

160
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,409
It's cranberry juice. Cranapple.

161
00:14:29,497 --> 00:14:30,528
Really?

162
00:14:30,623 --> 00:14:34,122
If you could talk to them,
I'd really appreciate it. I'm really late.

163
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:38,338
- I have to be at Hubert's in 15 minutes.
- Hubert's? That moved uptown, right?

164
00:14:38,423 --> 00:14:41,210
Well, boy, I've got to go.
Thank you, Victoria.

165
00:14:41,342 --> 00:14:43,169
Maybe we could do lunch next week?

166
00:14:43,261 --> 00:14:45,004
- I'm downtown at...
- I don't know.

167
00:14:45,096 --> 00:14:48,014
- I'm at work all the time.
- What about a Saturday?

168
00:14:48,391 --> 00:14:49,969
- Next Saturday?
- Sure.

169
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:51,886
Can't, I've matinee of Les Mis.

170
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:55,228
- I've really got to go. Christ! I'll call you.
- Okay.

171
00:14:55,773 --> 00:14:56,805
Do.

172
00:14:58,109 --> 00:15:00,149
You're dating Luis. He's in Arizona.
You're fucking me.

173
00:15:00,236 --> 00:15:03,190
We haven't made plans.
What could you be up to tonight?

174
00:15:03,281 --> 00:15:05,772
- Stop it. I'm...
- On a lot of lithium?

175
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:09,319
Waiting for Luis to call me.
He said he'd call tonight.

176
00:15:09,704 --> 00:15:10,736
Pumpkin?

177
00:15:11,498 --> 00:15:13,040
You're dating an asshole.

178
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:16,912
Pumpkin, you're dating
the biggest dickweed in New York.

179
00:15:17,462 --> 00:15:20,961
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling,
tumbling dickweed.

180
00:15:21,216 --> 00:15:24,336
Patrick, stop calling me "Pumpkin," okay?

181
00:15:25,429 --> 00:15:26,508
I have to go.

182
00:15:26,596 --> 00:15:28,755
Courtney? Dinner?

183
00:15:29,057 --> 00:15:30,255
I can't.

184
00:15:30,392 --> 00:15:31,934
I'm thinking Dorsia.

185
00:15:34,438 --> 00:15:35,636
Dorsia's nice.

186
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:37,439
Wear something fabulous.

187
00:15:51,622 --> 00:15:53,330
- Dorsia.
- Yes.

188
00:15:53,415 --> 00:15:58,872
I know it's late, but is it possible to reserve
a table for two at 8:00 or 8:30 perhaps?

189
00:16:16,063 --> 00:16:19,931
A facial at Elizabeth Arden,
which was really relaxing...

190
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,316
...and then to the Pottery Barn...

191
00:16:23,821 --> 00:16:28,364
...where I got this little silver muffin dish.

192
00:16:28,784 --> 00:16:31,869
- Is that Donald Trump's car?
- Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.

193
00:16:31,954 --> 00:16:34,576
You should take more lithium
or have a Diet Coke.

194
00:16:34,665 --> 00:16:37,370
Some caffeine might get you
out of this slump.

195
00:16:37,752 --> 00:16:39,579
I just want a child.

196
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:44,000
Just two perfect...

197
00:16:45,843 --> 00:16:47,041
...children.

198
00:16:52,266 --> 00:16:54,425
- Are we here?
- Yeah.

199
00:17:02,527 --> 00:17:04,104
This is Dorsia?

200
00:17:04,445 --> 00:17:05,477
Yes, dear.

201
00:17:07,365 --> 00:17:11,363
You're gonna have the peanut butter soup
with smoked duck and mashed squash.

202
00:17:11,453 --> 00:17:15,320
New York Matinée called it,
"a playful but mysterious little dish."

203
00:17:15,415 --> 00:17:16,695
You'll love it.

204
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,869
And then the red snapper
with violets and pine nuts.

205
00:17:19,961 --> 00:17:21,954
I think that'll follow nicely.

206
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:25,424
Thanks, Patrick.

207
00:17:32,432 --> 00:17:34,639
Patrick, thanks so much
for looking after Courtney.

208
00:17:34,726 --> 00:17:36,719
Dorsia, how impressive!

209
00:17:37,187 --> 00:17:39,345
How on earth did you get a reservation?

210
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:40,720
Lucky, I guess.

211
00:17:42,234 --> 00:17:44,061
That's a wonderful suit.

212
00:17:44,152 --> 00:17:46,062
Don't tell me, let me guess.

213
00:17:47,698 --> 00:17:49,275
Valentino Couture?

214
00:17:51,535 --> 00:17:52,946
It looks so soft.

215
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:55,528
Your compliment was sufficient, Luis.

216
00:17:56,623 --> 00:17:59,328
Hello, Halberstram. Nice tie.

217
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:01,330
How the hell are you?

218
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,753
Allen has mistaken me for this dickhead,
Marcus Halberstram.

219
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,794
It seems logical because
Marcus also works at P & P...

220
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:09,961
... and does the same exact thing I do.

221
00:18:10,054 --> 00:18:14,098
He also has a penchant for Valentino suits
and Oliver People's glasses.

222
00:18:14,308 --> 00:18:18,092
We even go to the same barber,
although I have a slightly better haircut.

223
00:18:18,187 --> 00:18:20,179
So how's the Ransom account going?

224
00:18:20,272 --> 00:18:23,641
- It's all right.
- Really? That's interesting. It's not...

225
00:18:23,901 --> 00:18:25,443
...great?
- Well, you know.

226
00:18:25,528 --> 00:18:29,110
- So how's Cecelia? She's a great girl.
- Yeah.

227
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,482
- I'm very lucky.
- Hey, Allen!

228
00:18:31,701 --> 00:18:35,070
- Congratulations on the Fisher account.
- Thank you, Baxter.

229
00:18:35,371 --> 00:18:36,782
Paul. Squash?

230
00:18:40,543 --> 00:18:41,574
Call me.

231
00:18:43,379 --> 00:18:45,336
- How about Friday?
- No can do.

232
00:18:45,965 --> 00:18:48,337
I got an 8:30 res at Dorsia.

233
00:18:48,676 --> 00:18:51,381
Great sea urchin ceviche.

234
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:54,718
Dorsia on a Friday night?
How'd he swing that?

235
00:18:54,807 --> 00:18:56,301
I think he's lying.

236
00:18:59,062 --> 00:19:00,342
Is that a gram?

237
00:19:01,314 --> 00:19:03,271
New card. What do you think?

238
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:07,726
Very nice.

239
00:19:08,363 --> 00:19:09,442
Look at that.

240
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,488
Picked them up yesterday.

241
00:19:11,574 --> 00:19:13,483
- Good colouring.
- That's bone.

242
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:16,537
And the lettering is something
called Silian Rail.

243
00:19:16,621 --> 00:19:18,993
It's very cool, Bateman. But that's nothing.

244
00:19:19,082 --> 00:19:22,285
- Look at this.
- That is really nice.

245
00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:24,660
Eggshell with Romalian type.

246
00:19:25,672 --> 00:19:27,131
What do you think?

247
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:28,997
Nice.

248
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:31,631
Jesus. That is really super.

249
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,211
How'd a nitwit like you get so tasteful?

250
00:19:34,556 --> 00:19:38,767
I can't believe that Bryce prefers
Van Patten's card to mine.

251
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:42,222
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.

252
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:46,734
Raised lettering, Pale Nimbus.

253
00:19:47,694 --> 00:19:48,725
White.

254
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,236
Impressive. Very nice.

255
00:19:55,035 --> 00:19:56,944
Let's see Paul Allen's card.

256
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:13,500
Look at that subtle off-white colouring.

257
00:20:13,804 --> 00:20:15,761
The tasteful thickness of it.

258
00:20:16,056 --> 00:20:19,093
Oh, my God, it even has a watermark.

259
00:20:24,064 --> 00:20:27,516
Is something wrong?
Patrick? You're sweating.

260
00:20:56,848 --> 00:20:59,469
Hello. Pat Bateman.

261
00:21:00,101 --> 00:21:01,975
You want some money?

262
00:21:02,687 --> 00:21:03,801
Some food?

263
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:08,689
- Is this what you need?
- I'm hungry.

264
00:21:08,776 --> 00:21:10,935
Yeah, it's cold out too, isn't it?

265
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:16,950
Why don't you get a job?

266
00:21:17,035 --> 00:21:20,368
- Lf you're so hungry, why not get a job?
- I lost my job.

267
00:21:21,164 --> 00:21:23,203
Why? You're drinking?

268
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,583
Is that why you lost it?

269
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,294
Insider trading?

270
00:21:28,296 --> 00:21:29,494
Just joking.

271
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,418
What's your name?

272
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:33,584
- AI.
- Speak up! Come on.

273
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:36,762
- AI.
- Get a goddamn job, Al.

274
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,673
You've got a negative attitude.

275
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:41,932
That's what's stopping you.
You've got to get your act together.

276
00:21:42,018 --> 00:21:43,263
I'll help you.

277
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,522
You are so kind, mister. You're kind.

278
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:48,729
- You're a kind man.
- It's okay.

279
00:21:48,942 --> 00:21:53,651
Please, you got to tell me what to do.
You got to help me. I'm so cold.

280
00:21:53,864 --> 00:21:55,144
I'm hungry.

281
00:21:57,534 --> 00:22:01,318
Do you know how bad you smell?
You reek of shit. Do you know that?

282
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,079
I'm sorry.

283
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,169
It's just that...

284
00:22:08,545 --> 00:22:09,790
I don't know.

285
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,128
I don't have anything in common with you.

286
00:22:22,768 --> 00:22:24,761
Thank you, mister. Thank you.

287
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,772
I'm cold out here.

288
00:22:28,107 --> 00:22:30,598
Do you know what a fucking loser you are?

289
00:22:55,301 --> 00:22:57,839
What beautiful skin you have,
Mr. Bateman.

290
00:22:58,638 --> 00:23:01,093
So fine. So smooth.

291
00:23:08,981 --> 00:23:11,817
I have all the characteristics
of a human being:

292
00:23:12,068 --> 00:23:14,606
Flesh, blood, skin, hair.

293
00:23:15,363 --> 00:23:18,233
But not a single clear,
identifiable emotion...

294
00:23:18,741 --> 00:23:21,030
... except for greed and disgust.

295
00:23:22,787 --> 00:23:25,325
Something horrible is happening
inside of me.

296
00:23:25,415 --> 00:23:26,992
And I don't know why.

297
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:31,371
My nightly bloodlust has overflowed
into my days.

298
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:35,131
I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy.

299
00:23:35,675 --> 00:23:38,510
I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.

300
00:23:51,232 --> 00:23:53,806
Hey, McCloy, what do you say?

301
00:23:54,402 --> 00:23:59,064
Hamilton, have a holly jolly Christmas.
Is Allen still handling the Fisher account?

302
00:23:59,407 --> 00:24:02,029
- Of course, who else?
- Mistletoe alert!

303
00:24:02,494 --> 00:24:05,910
Merry Xmas, Patrick! Merry Xmas, Harry!

304
00:24:05,997 --> 00:24:07,990
- Merry Christmas.
- You're late, honey.

305
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,625
- No.
- Yes, you are.

306
00:24:09,793 --> 00:24:12,498
I've been here the entire time.
You just didn't see me.

307
00:24:12,587 --> 00:24:16,502
Say hello to Snowball. Snowball says,
"Merry Christmas, Patrick."

308
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:20,384
- What is it?
- It's a little baby piggy-wiggy, isn't it?

309
00:24:20,637 --> 00:24:25,299
It's a Vietnamese pot-bellied pig.
They make darling pets. Don't you?

310
00:24:27,853 --> 00:24:30,522
Stop scowling, Patrick.
You're such a Grinch.

311
00:24:30,647 --> 00:24:34,811
What's Mr. Grinch want for Christmas?
And don't say breast implants again.

312
00:24:37,696 --> 00:24:39,190
- Allen!
- Marcus!

313
00:24:39,615 --> 00:24:42,900
Merry Christmas! How have you been?
Workaholic, I suppose.

314
00:24:42,993 --> 00:24:44,867
Haven't seen you in a while.

315
00:24:44,954 --> 00:24:48,287
Hamilton, we're going to Nell's.
Limo's out front.

316
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:51,912
- We should have dinner.
- Maybe you could bring...

317
00:24:52,127 --> 00:24:54,583
- Cecelia?
- Yes, Cecelia.

318
00:24:54,672 --> 00:24:56,960
Cecelia would adore it.

319
00:24:57,049 --> 00:24:59,089
Well then, let's do it, Marcus.

320
00:24:59,468 --> 00:25:01,093
- Great party.
- Thanks.

321
00:25:01,554 --> 00:25:03,926
Patrick, why is he calling you Marcus?

322
00:25:04,765 --> 00:25:06,259
Mistletoe alert!

323
00:25:14,775 --> 00:25:17,148
Marcus Halberstram for two at 7:00.

324
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,608
No, I want to know...

325
00:25:20,698 --> 00:25:23,533
Okay, I came here
for the cilantro fish gumbo, all right?

326
00:25:23,618 --> 00:25:27,069
It's the only excuse one could have
for being here, which is...

327
00:25:27,163 --> 00:25:29,286
...by the way, almost completely empty.

328
00:25:29,374 --> 00:25:32,458
- I'm very sorry, sir.
- J & B straight and a Corona.

329
00:25:32,627 --> 00:25:35,296
- Would you like to...
- Double Absolut martini!

330
00:25:35,672 --> 00:25:36,703
Yes, sir.

331
00:25:36,923 --> 00:25:41,134
- Would you like to hear the specials?
- Not if you want to keep your spleen.

332
00:25:43,638 --> 00:25:46,259
This is a real beehive of activity,
Halberstram.

333
00:25:46,349 --> 00:25:48,507
This place is hot, very hot.

334
00:25:49,018 --> 00:25:52,684
The mud soup and the charcoal arugula
are outrageous here.

335
00:25:52,772 --> 00:25:54,599
Yeah, well, you're late.

336
00:25:55,066 --> 00:25:57,604
I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break.

337
00:25:58,361 --> 00:26:01,031
I see they've omitted the pork loin
with lime jello.

338
00:26:01,114 --> 00:26:02,822
We should've gone to Dorsia.

339
00:26:02,907 --> 00:26:06,241
- I could've gotten us a table.
- Nobody goes there anymore.

340
00:26:08,496 --> 00:26:10,240
Is that lvana Trump?

341
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:14,876
Jeez, Patrick. I mean Marcus.
What are you thinking?

342
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,911
Why would lvana be at Texarkana?

343
00:26:18,965 --> 00:26:22,880
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling
the Fisher account?

344
00:26:23,261 --> 00:26:24,637
How'd you get it?

345
00:26:24,721 --> 00:26:27,047
I could tell you that, Halberstram...

346
00:26:27,849 --> 00:26:30,008
...but then I'd have to kill you.

347
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:40,728
I like to dissect girls.
Did you know I'm utterly insane?

348
00:26:43,532 --> 00:26:45,988
Great tan, Marcus. Really impressive.

349
00:26:46,076 --> 00:26:47,950
- Where do you tan?
- Salon.

350
00:26:48,037 --> 00:26:51,203
I've got a tanning bed at home.
You should look into it.

351
00:26:51,332 --> 00:26:54,498
And Cecelia? How is she?

352
00:26:55,127 --> 00:26:58,626
- Where is she tonight?
- Well, you know Cecelia...

353
00:26:58,714 --> 00:27:02,000
I think she's having dinner
with Evelyn Williams.

354
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:03,291
Evelyn?

355
00:27:04,261 --> 00:27:08,129
Great ass. Goes out with that loser,
Patrick Bateman. What a dork!

356
00:27:09,975 --> 00:27:11,090
Another martini, Paul?

357
00:27:17,608 --> 00:27:19,767
You like Huey Lewis & the News?

358
00:27:20,653 --> 00:27:21,898
They're okay.

359
00:27:23,489 --> 00:27:27,403
Their early work was
a little too New Wave for my taste.

360
00:27:27,743 --> 00:27:30,365
But when Sports came out in '83...

361
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:34,743
...I think they really came into their own,
commercially and artistically.

362
00:27:36,836 --> 00:27:39,374
The whole album has a clear, crisp sound...

363
00:27:39,464 --> 00:27:42,133
...and a new sheen
of consummate professionalism...

364
00:27:42,216 --> 00:27:44,886
...that really gives the songs a big boost.

365
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:57,097
He's been compared to Elvis Costello.

366
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:00,808
But I think Huey has a far more bitter,
cynical sense of humour.

367
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,812
- Hey, Halberstram?
- Yes, Allen?

368
00:28:04,197 --> 00:28:07,696
Why are there copies of the Style section
all over the place?

369
00:28:07,826 --> 00:28:11,076
Do you have a dog?
A little chow or something?

370
00:28:11,997 --> 00:28:13,076
No, Allen.

371
00:28:13,164 --> 00:28:15,738
- Is that a raincoat?
- Yes, it is.

372
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:21,879
In 1987, Huey released this,
Four, their most accomplished album.

373
00:28:21,965 --> 00:28:25,299
I think their undisputed masterpiece is
Hip To Be Square.

374
00:28:25,385 --> 00:28:28,885
A song so catchy that most people
probably don't listen to the lyrics.

375
00:28:28,972 --> 00:28:32,637
But they should because it's not just
about the pleasures of conformity...

376
00:28:32,726 --> 00:28:37,352
...and the importance of trends. It's also
a personal statement about the band itself.

377
00:28:37,481 --> 00:28:38,595
Hey, Paul!

378
00:28:44,154 --> 00:28:49,279
Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now,
you fucking stupid bastard!

379
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:01,724
Patrick? Patrick?

380
00:30:02,817 --> 00:30:06,020
- Is that you?
- No, Luis. It's not me.

381
00:30:06,112 --> 00:30:07,227
You're mistaken.

382
00:30:07,322 --> 00:30:09,991
This is my very good friend,
Patrick Bateman.

383
00:30:10,158 --> 00:30:12,530
Where are you going?
We're going to Nell's.

384
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:14,695
Gwendolyn's father is buying it.

385
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:20,533
Where did you get that overnight bag?

386
00:30:22,504 --> 00:30:23,963
Jean Paul Gaultier.

387
00:30:36,143 --> 00:30:39,808
When I get to Paul Allen's place,
I use the keys I took from his pocket...

388
00:30:39,896 --> 00:30:41,770
... before disposing of the body.

389
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:44,515
There is a moment of sheer panic...

390
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:48,561
... when I realise that Paul's apartment
overlooks the park.

391
00:30:49,531 --> 00:30:52,069
And is obviously more expensive
than mine.

392
00:30:55,412 --> 00:30:58,366
I calm myself,
and move into the bedroom...

393
00:30:58,665 --> 00:31:01,417
... where I find his suitcase and
start to pack.

394
00:31:02,086 --> 00:31:04,623
It's time for Paul to take a little trip.

395
00:31:07,091 --> 00:31:08,834
Where to send the bastard?

396
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:10,499
Dallas?

397
00:31:11,345 --> 00:31:16,340
Paris? Singapore? London?
I'll send the asshole to London.

398
00:31:24,775 --> 00:31:27,942
Hi, this is Paul.
I've been called to London for a few days.

399
00:31:28,028 --> 00:31:31,694
Meredith, I'll call you when I get back.
Hasta la vista, baby.

400
00:31:56,641 --> 00:31:57,803
What is it?

401
00:31:59,102 --> 00:32:00,726
Patrick, it's just...

402
00:32:01,062 --> 00:32:02,141
Yes, Jean?

403
00:32:02,689 --> 00:32:05,358
- Mr. Donald Kimball is here to see you.
- Who?

404
00:32:06,234 --> 00:32:07,977
Detective Donald Kimball?

405
00:32:12,824 --> 00:32:14,448
Tell him I'm at lunch.

406
00:32:15,076 --> 00:32:18,243
Patrick, it's only 10:30.
I think he knows you're here.

407
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:20,616
Send him in, I guess.

408
00:32:27,422 --> 00:32:31,254
Now John, you've got to wear clothes
in proportion to your physique.

409
00:32:31,384 --> 00:32:35,334
There are definite do's and don'ts,
good buddy, of wearing a bold stripe shirt.

410
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:40,507
A bold striped shirt calls for solid coloured
or discreetly patterned suits and ties.

411
00:32:40,602 --> 00:32:43,686
Yes, always tip the stylist 15%.

412
00:32:44,439 --> 00:32:47,891
Listen John, I've got to go.
T. Bone Pickens just walked in.

413
00:32:47,984 --> 00:32:49,183
Just joking.

414
00:32:49,653 --> 00:32:51,978
No, don't tip the owner of the salon.

415
00:32:52,447 --> 00:32:55,069
Okay John, right, got it.

416
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:57,816
Sorry.

417
00:32:58,036 --> 00:33:00,444
No, I'm sorry.
I should've made an appointment.

418
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:02,578
Was that anything important?

419
00:33:02,666 --> 00:33:05,287
That? Just mulling
over business problems.

420
00:33:05,502 --> 00:33:08,373
Examining opportunities.
Exchanging rumours.

421
00:33:08,964 --> 00:33:10,375
Spreading gossip.

422
00:33:11,633 --> 00:33:13,959
Hi. I'm Donald Kimball.

423
00:33:14,887 --> 00:33:18,671
- Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
- Sorry to barge in on you like this.

424
00:33:18,766 --> 00:33:20,924
I know how busy you guys can get.

425
00:33:23,395 --> 00:33:25,518
So, what's the...

426
00:33:26,732 --> 00:33:30,315
...topic of discussion?
- I've been hired by Meredith Powell...

427
00:33:30,694 --> 00:33:33,612
...to investigate the disappearance
of Paul Allen.

428
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:37,564
I see, Paul's disappearance, yeah.

429
00:33:37,743 --> 00:33:39,487
It's nothing that official.

430
00:33:39,578 --> 00:33:42,449
I just have some basic questions
about Paul and yourself.

431
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,117
- Coffee?
- No, I'm okay.

432
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:46,285
- Apollinaris?
- No, I'm okay.

433
00:33:48,421 --> 00:33:50,460
- Can you bring Mr...
- Kimball.

434
00:33:50,548 --> 00:33:52,754
- A bottle of...
- No, really, I'm okay.

435
00:33:52,842 --> 00:33:54,217
It's no problem.

436
00:33:56,929 --> 00:33:59,136
So, what's the topic of discussion?

437
00:33:59,724 --> 00:34:02,215
Disappearance of Paul Allen.

438
00:34:02,477 --> 00:34:04,849
Right. Well, I...

439
00:34:07,231 --> 00:34:11,015
I haven't heard anything
about the disappearance or anything.

440
00:34:11,152 --> 00:34:13,109
Not on page six, at least.

441
00:34:13,363 --> 00:34:16,364
- His family wants this kept quiet.
- Understandable.

442
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:18,489
- Lime?
- No, really. I'm okay.

443
00:34:18,576 --> 00:34:20,154
Sure? I can get you a lime.

444
00:34:20,245 --> 00:34:23,945
Just some preliminary questions
that I need for my own files, okay?

445
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,071
Shoot.

446
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,826
- How old are you?
- 27.

447
00:34:28,795 --> 00:34:32,378
- Where did you go to school?
- Harvard. The Harvard Business School.

448
00:34:32,465 --> 00:34:33,580
Your address?

449
00:34:33,675 --> 00:34:36,130
American Gardens Building,
West 81st Street.

450
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:37,630
Nice. Very nice.

451
00:34:37,971 --> 00:34:39,002
Thanks.

452
00:34:39,472 --> 00:34:42,639
- What can you tell me about Paul Allen?
- I'm at a loss.

453
00:34:43,184 --> 00:34:45,758
- He was part of that whole Yale thing.
- Yale thing?

454
00:34:45,854 --> 00:34:47,313
Yeah. Yale thing.

455
00:34:47,522 --> 00:34:48,803
What do you mean?

456
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:52,813
Well, I think for one that
he was probably a closet homosexual...

457
00:34:52,903 --> 00:34:56,022
...who did a lot of cocaine. That Yale thing.

458
00:34:57,449 --> 00:35:01,363
What kind of a man was he? Besides
the information you've just given me?

459
00:35:01,453 --> 00:35:05,036
- I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
- Do you feel like that?

460
00:35:05,123 --> 00:35:06,499
No. Not really.

461
00:35:08,251 --> 00:35:09,959
Where did Paul hang out?

462
00:35:10,212 --> 00:35:12,418
- Hang out?
- Yeah. You know, hang out.

463
00:35:12,506 --> 00:35:13,751
Let me think.

464
00:35:14,174 --> 00:35:17,508
The Newport. Harry's. Fluties.

465
00:35:17,928 --> 00:35:20,501
Indochine. Nell's. The Cornell Club.

466
00:35:20,597 --> 00:35:22,970
- The New York Yacht Club.
- He had a yacht?

467
00:35:23,058 --> 00:35:26,510
- No, he just hung out there.
- And where did he go to school?

468
00:35:28,564 --> 00:35:31,849
- Don't you know this?
- I just wanted to know if you know.

469
00:35:35,779 --> 00:35:38,650
Before Yale?
If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's.

470
00:35:38,741 --> 00:35:42,240
Listen, I just want to help.

471
00:35:43,746 --> 00:35:44,991
I understand.

472
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:49,452
Any witnesses or fingerprints?

473
00:35:49,543 --> 00:35:53,588
There's a message on his answering
machine that says he went to London.

474
00:35:53,672 --> 00:35:56,164
- Maybe he did.
- His girlfriend doesn't think so.

475
00:35:56,258 --> 00:35:58,796
- Has anyone seen him in London?
- Actually, yes.

476
00:35:59,178 --> 00:36:01,883
But I've had difficulty getting
an actual verification.

477
00:36:01,973 --> 00:36:05,424
A Stephen Hughes said he saw him
at a restaurant there.

478
00:36:05,518 --> 00:36:09,847
But I checked it out and what happened is,
he mistook a Herbert Ainsworth for Paul.

479
00:36:09,939 --> 00:36:13,225
- Had his apartment been burglarised?
- No, actually it hadn't.

480
00:36:13,568 --> 00:36:17,233
Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone.
So was some luggage. That's it.

481
00:36:17,321 --> 00:36:19,563
Anyone dealing with the homicide squad?

482
00:36:19,657 --> 00:36:21,864
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure.

483
00:36:21,951 --> 00:36:24,573
Basically, no one's seen or heard anything.

484
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,621
- So typical, isn't it?
- It's just strange.

485
00:36:27,832 --> 00:36:30,952
One day someone's walking around,
going to work...

486
00:36:31,502 --> 00:36:33,579
...alive, and then...
- Nothing.

487
00:36:35,006 --> 00:36:36,631
People just disappear.

488
00:36:37,425 --> 00:36:40,675
The earth just opens up
and swallows them.

489
00:36:41,971 --> 00:36:44,427
Eerie. Really eerie.

490
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:55,024
You'll have to excuse me.
I have a meeting with Cliff Huxtable...

491
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,435
...at the Four Seasons in 20 minutes.

492
00:36:57,696 --> 00:37:00,732
The Four Seasons?
Isn't that a little far uptown?

493
00:37:00,824 --> 00:37:03,066
Aren't you going to be late?

494
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,784
No. There's one down here.

495
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:07,443
- Really? I didn't know that.
- Yes, it's very good.

496
00:37:07,539 --> 00:37:11,288
Listen, if anything occurs to you,
any information...

497
00:37:11,376 --> 00:37:13,250
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.

498
00:37:13,337 --> 00:37:17,999
Great. And thanks for your time,
Mr. Bateman.

499
00:37:21,845 --> 00:37:23,220
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

500
00:38:23,324 --> 00:38:26,823
- I haven't seen you around here.
- You just haven't been looking.

501
00:38:26,911 --> 00:38:29,117
Would you like to see my apartment?

502
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:31,247
I'm not supposed to.

503
00:38:33,209 --> 00:38:35,783
Do you want to come
to my apartment or not?

504
00:38:37,046 --> 00:38:40,961
I'm not supposed to,
but I can make an exception.

505
00:38:44,095 --> 00:38:45,886
Do you take a credit card?

506
00:38:46,598 --> 00:38:49,219
I'm joking. Come on, get in.

507
00:39:00,445 --> 00:39:05,024
I'd like a girl, early twenties, blonde,
who does couples.

508
00:39:05,116 --> 00:39:08,817
Couples. I really can't stress
blonde enough.

509
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:10,110
Blonde.

510
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,498
I'm Paul. My name is Paul Allen.
You got that?

511
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:20,167
You're Christie.

512
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:22,499
You are to respond only to Christie.

513
00:39:22,884 --> 00:39:24,129
Is that clear?

514
00:39:34,396 --> 00:39:37,101
It's a very fine Chardonnay you're drinking.

515
00:39:37,482 --> 00:39:39,559
I want you to clean your vagina.

516
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,653
No, from behind.

517
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:51,788
Get on your knees.

518
00:39:52,373 --> 00:39:54,246
You have a very nice body.

519
00:40:06,887 --> 00:40:08,595
Thank you. Send her up.

520
00:40:12,226 --> 00:40:16,306
Christie, get out and dry off, choose a robe.

521
00:40:16,939 --> 00:40:18,184
Not the Bijan.

522
00:40:18,357 --> 00:40:22,651
Then, come and meet me and our guest
in the living room for drinks.

523
00:40:29,577 --> 00:40:31,486
You've arrived! How lovely.

524
00:40:31,746 --> 00:40:35,826
Let me take your coat. I'm Paul.
How good of you to come.

525
00:40:41,422 --> 00:40:43,214
Not quite blonde, are you?

526
00:40:43,758 --> 00:40:45,217
More dirty blonde.

527
00:40:46,052 --> 00:40:48,045
I'm going to call you Sabrina.

528
00:40:48,638 --> 00:40:49,918
I'm Paul Allen.

529
00:41:08,742 --> 00:41:09,773
So...

530
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:13,945
...don't you want to know what I do?

531
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:18,407
No.

532
00:41:18,627 --> 00:41:19,907
No, not really.

533
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:24,709
Well, I work on Wall Street.

534
00:41:25,967 --> 00:41:27,510
At Pierce & Pierce.

535
00:41:27,928 --> 00:41:29,505
Have you heard of it?

536
00:41:38,772 --> 00:41:41,263
You have a really nice place here, Paul.

537
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:44,268
How much did you pay for it?

538
00:41:44,486 --> 00:41:47,902
Well actually, that's none of your business.

539
00:41:48,866 --> 00:41:51,701
But I can assure you,
it certainly wasn't cheap.

540
00:41:52,161 --> 00:41:54,367
No. No smoking. Not in here.

541
00:41:57,416 --> 00:41:58,661
Varda Truffle?

542
00:42:01,295 --> 00:42:03,620
I don't want you to get drunk, but...

543
00:42:04,173 --> 00:42:07,293
...that's a very fine Chardonnay
you're not drinking.

544
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:17,011
Do you like Phil Collins?

545
00:42:17,436 --> 00:42:21,932
I've been a big Genesis fan ever since
the release of their 1980 album...

546
00:42:22,358 --> 00:42:23,389
... Duke.

547
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:28,607
Before that I really didn't understand
any of their work.

548
00:42:29,281 --> 00:42:31,855
It's too artsy, too intellectual.

549
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:37,652
It was on Duke, where Phil Collins'
presence became more apparent.

550
00:42:40,418 --> 00:42:45,044
I think Invisible Touch is
the group's undisputed masterpiece.

551
00:42:47,967 --> 00:42:51,585
It's an epic meditation on intangibility.

552
00:42:54,807 --> 00:42:57,429
At the same time,
it deepens and enriches...

553
00:42:57,685 --> 00:43:00,355
...the meaning
of the preceding three albums.

554
00:43:01,356 --> 00:43:03,977
Christie, take off the robe.

555
00:43:05,944 --> 00:43:10,321
Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing
of Banks, Collins, and Rutherford.

556
00:43:11,908 --> 00:43:15,242
You can practically hear every nuance
of every instrument.

557
00:43:15,995 --> 00:43:18,035
Sabrina, remove your dress.

558
00:43:18,915 --> 00:43:22,533
In terms of lyrical craftsmanship
and sheer song writing...

559
00:43:22,961 --> 00:43:25,831
...this album hits a new peak
of professionalism.

560
00:43:26,089 --> 00:43:28,461
Sabrina, why don't you dance a little?

561
00:43:29,634 --> 00:43:31,960
Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion...

562
00:43:32,429 --> 00:43:37,589
...in this song, Phil Collins addresses
the problems of abusive political authority.

563
00:43:40,103 --> 00:43:44,516
In Too Deep is the most moving pop song
of the 1980s...

564
00:43:44,816 --> 00:43:47,486
...about monogamy and commitment.

565
00:43:48,779 --> 00:43:50,855
The song is extremely uplifting.

566
00:43:51,031 --> 00:43:54,530
Their lyrics are
as positive and affirmative...

567
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,245
...as anything I've heard in rock.

568
00:44:02,417 --> 00:44:06,546
Christie, get down on your knees,
so Sabrina can see your asshole.

569
00:44:07,923 --> 00:44:09,999
Phil Collins' solo career...

570
00:44:10,426 --> 00:44:12,584
...seems to be more commercial...

571
00:44:12,803 --> 00:44:16,089
...and therefore,
more satisfying in a narrower way...

572
00:44:16,724 --> 00:44:21,136
...especially songs like In the Air Tonight
and Against All Odds.

573
00:44:23,189 --> 00:44:25,727
Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it.

574
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:32,068
I also think that Phil Collins works best
within the confines of the group...

575
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,199
...than as a solo artist.

576
00:44:34,283 --> 00:44:37,070
And I stress the word "artist."

577
00:44:41,582 --> 00:44:44,832
This is Sussudio, a great, great song.

578
00:44:45,711 --> 00:44:47,254
A personal favourite.

579
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:58,074
Don't touch the watch.

580
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:21,797
Can we go now?

581
00:46:22,601 --> 00:46:24,226
We're not through yet.

582
00:46:42,663 --> 00:46:46,364
If they have a good personality
and aren't great looking, then who cares?

583
00:46:46,459 --> 00:46:50,373
Let's say hypothetically, okay?
What if they have a good personality?

584
00:46:52,214 --> 00:46:53,459
I know, I know.

585
00:46:53,549 --> 00:46:56,171
"There are no girls
with good personalities."

586
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:59,261
A good personality consists
of a chick with a hardbody...

587
00:46:59,347 --> 00:47:02,680
...who'll satisfy all sexual demands
without being too slutty...

588
00:47:02,767 --> 00:47:05,174
...and who'll keep her dumb,
fucking mouth shut.

589
00:47:05,269 --> 00:47:07,677
The only girls with good personalities,
smart...

590
00:47:07,772 --> 00:47:10,441
...funny, halfway intelligent, or talented...

591
00:47:10,525 --> 00:47:14,060
...though God knows what the fuck
that means, are ugly chicks.

592
00:47:14,278 --> 00:47:17,648
This is because they have to make up
for how fucking ugly they are.

593
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:20,944
- You know what Ed Gein said?
- Ed Gein? Maître d' at Canal Bar?

594
00:47:21,035 --> 00:47:24,654
- No. Serial killer, Wisconsin in the '50s.
- And what did Ed say?

595
00:47:24,747 --> 00:47:27,784
"When I see a pretty girl,
I think of two things...

596
00:47:27,876 --> 00:47:30,082
"...one part of me wants to take her out...

597
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:33,373
"...talk to her, be real nice and sweet
and treat her right."

598
00:47:33,465 --> 00:47:35,623
What did the other part of him think?

599
00:47:35,717 --> 00:47:38,255
What her head would look like on a stick.

600
00:47:43,141 --> 00:47:46,557
Hi, guys. I want to get your opinion
on something.

601
00:47:47,687 --> 00:47:49,312
It's my business card.

602
00:47:50,273 --> 00:47:52,313
I decided to get a new one, too.

603
00:47:57,197 --> 00:47:58,572
Very nice, Luis.

604
00:48:00,867 --> 00:48:01,982
Thank you.

605
00:48:16,425 --> 00:48:17,670
What about dinner?

606
00:48:17,759 --> 00:48:21,508
Is that all you ever have to contribute?
What about fucking dinner?

607
00:48:21,597 --> 00:48:24,384
Cheer up there. What's the matter?
No shiatsu today?

608
00:48:24,475 --> 00:48:26,716
Touch me again
and you'll draw back a stump.

609
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:29,099
- Hold on there, little buddy.
- Excuse me.

610
00:49:07,643 --> 00:49:10,217
Patrick, why here?

611
00:49:10,479 --> 00:49:12,389
I've seen you looking at me.

612
00:49:13,149 --> 00:49:15,355
I've noticed your...

613
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,559
...hot body.

614
00:49:19,113 --> 00:49:20,358
Don't be shy.

615
00:49:20,907 --> 00:49:25,818
You can't imagine how long I've wanted
this, ever since that party at Arizona 206.

616
00:49:25,912 --> 00:49:29,862
You know, the one you were wearing that
red striped paisley Armani tie.

617
00:49:33,127 --> 00:49:34,242
I want you.

618
00:49:34,963 --> 00:49:36,338
I want you, too.

619
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:38,918
- Patrick!
- What is it?

620
00:49:40,343 --> 00:49:41,968
Where are you going?

621
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:45,087
I've got to return some video tapes.

622
00:49:56,067 --> 00:49:57,811
I'll call you.

623
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:28,383
I've been wanting to talk with you!
Come in to my office.

624
00:50:28,475 --> 00:50:30,432
Jean, great jacket. Matsuda?

625
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,437
Do you remember where you were
the night of Paul's disappearance?

626
00:50:34,523 --> 00:50:36,765
Which was on December 20?

627
00:50:37,276 --> 00:50:41,274
God, I guess
I was probably returning videotapes.

628
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:48,943
- I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
- That's not what I've got.

629
00:50:49,038 --> 00:50:52,288
- What?
- That's not the information I've received.

630
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,084
Well, wait.
What information have you received?
