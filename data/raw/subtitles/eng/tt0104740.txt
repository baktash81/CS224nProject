00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,795
(Gasps)

2
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,618
Huh?

3
00:03:34,643 --> 00:03:36,643
Wha...?

4
00:03:36,895 --> 00:03:39,343
I-It can't be!

5
00:03:40,922 --> 00:03:42,375
Can it?

6
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:43,778
It is!

7
00:03:43,802 --> 00:03:45,802
I'm really flying!

8
00:03:47,077 --> 00:03:49,076

Up up in the clouds we go!

This is fantastic!

19
00:04:48,032 --> 00:04:50,189
Yippeee!

20
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:18,823
What kind of a city is this?

21
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:21,774
Huh?

22
00:05:25,423 --> 00:05:27,034
Huh?

23
00:05:28,222 --> 00:05:33,717

Mom!

38
00:07:04,071 --> 00:07:06,413
We've gotta get out of the house!

39
00:07:16,951 --> 00:07:18,806
No... Mom!

40
00:07:18,831 --> 00:07:21,196
Mom! The train!

41
00:07:24,306 --> 00:07:28,123
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!

42
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,891
Whew... just a dream.

43
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,010
[Mom] Nemo, are you all right?

44
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,339
[Dad] Having bad dreams?

45
00:07:41,364 --> 00:07:42,847
[Mom] Oh, Nemo!

46
00:07:42,872 --> 00:07:45,832
[Mom] Have you been sneaking pies again?

47
00:08:08,744 --> 00:08:10,744
Hey! Huhuh

48
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:14,622

Icarus! Come on, Icarus, let's go!

00:08:27,323 --> 00:08:31,034

It's great! Right, lcarus?

63
00:09:21,165 --> 00:09:24,724

Get your tickets now for the grandest show in the world!

65

You're a delightful boy.

66
00:09:36,852 --> 00:09:38,003
Papa! Papa!

67
00:09:38,028 --> 00:09:39,513
The circus is in town, Papa!

68
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:40,521
That's nice, Nemo.

69
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,640
Please, will you take me to see it?
Please Papa?

70
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,257
Maybe tomorrow, Nemo.

71
00:09:44,282 --> 00:09:46,293
Oh, you always say "tomorrow", Papa.

72
00:09:46,318 --> 00:09:48,152
Oh no! l'm late for a meeting.

73
00:09:48,177 --> 00:09:49,856
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

74
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,686
Perhaps tomorrow, Nemo.

75
00:09:51,711 --> 00:09:55,320
Goodbye Ralph, have a wonderful day!

76
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,690
Oh, gee.

77
00:10:01,104 --> 00:10:02,154
Good night, dear.

78
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:04,763
Join you in a minute, honey.

79
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:52,613
"Remember your promise".
Mm.

80
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,022
Uhhh.

81
00:11:00,047 --> 00:11:00,989
Nemo!

82
00:11:01,014 --> 00:11:03,319
Huh? W... W... Where... where am l?

83
00:11:03,344 --> 00:11:07,124
Oh Nemo. How many times
do I have to tell you?

84
00:11:07,545 --> 00:11:11,296
W... What have I been doing??
Uhhhhh

85
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,525
Nemo! Stop!

86
00:11:17,574 --> 00:11:19,541
Nemo!

87
00:11:25,364 --> 00:11:29,363
Ralph, would you please talk to that son of ours?

88
00:11:29,536 --> 00:11:31,951
He won't listen to a word I say.

89
00:11:31,976 --> 00:11:35,310
In the morning.
In the morning.

90
00:11:35,335 --> 00:11:38,239
Huh, phew!
That was close.

91
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,083
lcarus!
Wake up!

92
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,001

93
00:12:35,611 --> 00:12:37,611
Shhhhhhhh!

94
00:12:53,074 --> 00:12:54,374
Assemble yourselves.

95
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,035
This is a royal calling.

96
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,246
Atten...
Hut! Hut! Hut!

97
00:13:00,176 --> 00:13:01,398
Ahem!

98
00:13:01,885 --> 00:13:02,990
Whoops!
Huh?

99
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,318
Oh no, oh my.

100
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:09,710
(Clears throat)

101
00:13:09,735 --> 00:13:11,227
Greetings, my boy.

102
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:14,227
Do I have the honor of
addressing Little Nemo?

103
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:15,645
Uh huh.

104
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,845
But who are you?

105
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,655
l am a professor.
I am a genius.

106
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,925
You can call me Professor Genius.

107
00:13:22,423 --> 00:13:24,094
And this would be BonBon.

108
00:13:24,283 --> 00:13:25,758
At your service!

109
00:13:25,783 --> 00:13:26,847
At <i>my</i> service?

110
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:29,028
We have been sent here on a mission...

111
00:13:29,053 --> 00:13:32,119
...by King Morpheus, the King of Slumberland.

112
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,706
King Morpheus?

113
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:34,997
Slumberland?

114
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,857
Yes, indeed.
Yes indeed!

115
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,293
Don't forget the present from the Princess.

116
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,335
I am not finished, kindly wait your turn.

117
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:44,498
(Clears throat)

118
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:48,192
His Serene Highness, King Morpheus,
the ruler of Slumberland,

119
00:13:48,216 --> 00:13:51,730
and divine protector of everyone's good dream

120
00:13:51,755 --> 00:13:56,771
and his daughter, Princess Camille,
extend this invitation to Little Nemo:

121
00:13:56,796 --> 00:14:01,983
To visit our Slumberland and be the
official playmate to Princess Camille

122
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,954
Gee, thanks!

123
00:14:03,979 --> 00:14:06,457
The Princess Camille is
eagerly awaiting you...

124
00:14:06,482 --> 00:14:08,607
...well, shall we be going,
young man?

125
00:14:08,632 --> 00:14:09,866
Wait a minute!

126
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:14,295
This princess is a girl?
But l've never played with a girl.

127
00:14:14,483 --> 00:14:15,708
What? Well.

128
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:18,394
A girl? She's a princess!

129
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:19,529
Doesn't matter.

130
00:14:19,554 --> 00:14:21,294
She's still a girl.

131
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:24,125
And besides, l've never heard of Slumberland.

132
00:14:25,102 --> 00:14:28,875
No one has ever been displeased
with a royal invitation!

133
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,765
W-What about the present?

134
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,249
Present? What present?

135
00:14:32,274 --> 00:14:36,239
All her adorable marvelousness,
Princess Camille, has sent a present for you!

136
00:14:36,264 --> 00:14:37,936

139
00:14:43,961 --> 00:14:47,134
Wow, this is great!
I love the Princess!

140
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,231
l love girls!

141
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:58,837
The King even sent his personal dirigible.

142
00:14:58,862 --> 00:15:03,183
A dirigible? A real dirigible?

143
00:15:03,753 --> 00:15:06,223
Wooooooow!

144
00:15:06,248 --> 00:15:11,878
Wowwee, Icarus, it is --
Just like my dirigible!

145
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:15,134
Hi there!

146
00:15:17,165 --> 00:15:21,130
And, upon the King's royal command,
it's waiting for you, my boy.

147
00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:24,170
I accept!
We accept this invitation!

148
00:15:24,195 --> 00:15:25,173
Right, lcarus?

149
00:15:29,152 --> 00:15:31,329
Better leave Mom a note.

150
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:36,796
Hurry! The dirigible's departure
time cannot be delayed!

151
00:15:37,008 --> 00:15:38,842
His Majesty and the Princess are waiting!

152
00:15:39,718 --> 00:15:41,665
Hurry! Hurry, dear boy!

153
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,907
Okay!

154
00:15:54,042 --> 00:15:57,431
Prepare to pull...
Ballast away!

155
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:01,948
lcarus! Look at our home,
it looks like a toy house!

156
00:16:02,938 --> 00:16:06,776
Jeepers! We're going so high!

157
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:17,809
Now, Nemo, we call this...

158
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,727
The wheelhouse!

159
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:19,752
Yes!
l know.

160
00:16:19,776 --> 00:16:21,463
Wowwee!

161
00:16:21,619 --> 00:16:23,898
Stabilize and maintain altitude.

162
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,983
Full speed ahead!

163
00:16:26,008 --> 00:16:28,421
How about taking the helm, Nemo?

164
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:29,279
Me?

165
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,255
Yes! Hold the wheel tightly now.

166
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,160
Like this?

167
00:16:33,185 --> 00:16:35,716
Good lad, yes!

168
00:16:35,873 --> 00:16:37,169
Easy...

169
00:16:37,194 --> 00:16:41,219
Very good, you'll make
a captain one day!

170
00:16:41,644 --> 00:16:45,790
Yippee! Weeeee! Haha!

171
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,532
Hahaha! Weeee! Hahaha!

172
00:16:54,557 --> 00:16:56,609
You fly like an acrobat!

173
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:58,633
Yeah! Haha!

174
00:17:05,008 --> 00:17:07,906
It's a Nightmare!

175
00:17:08,587 --> 00:17:11,005
Oh oh oh oh!

176
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,276
Steady, steady!

177
00:17:13,401 --> 00:17:14,962
Full power!

178
00:17:14,987 --> 00:17:20,234
Don't worry, folks. I've sailed
through Nightmare before.

179
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,327
Crystal Clouds dead ahead!

180
00:17:24,352 --> 00:17:28,022
Oh, thank heaven. Once we're
in the clouds, we'll be safe.

181
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,255
Full throttle!

182
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:32,130
Hold her steady, Nemo.

183
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,677
A-Are we safe now?

184
00:17:40,702 --> 00:17:43,160
Yes, yes dear boy.
Very safe.

185
00:17:43,185 --> 00:17:45,993
We're coming out of the cloud!

186
00:17:46,226 --> 00:17:50,142
Engines at slow speed.

187
00:17:58,589 --> 00:18:01,783

Indeed, they do!

We've all come to greet you, Nemo!

193
00:18:24,084 --> 00:18:25,676
Hello there!

00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,194
Who's that?

197
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,785
Stay away from him my boy.

198
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:39,802
Well, hiya kid!

202
00:18:45,575 --> 00:18:46,417
Okay.

203
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:48,020
Bye.

204
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,359
Who was that, Professor?

205
00:18:51,384 --> 00:18:53,173
Flip, a frightful fellow.

206
00:18:53,712 --> 00:18:54,424
Flip?

207
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:58,094
Please, forget you ever
heard that name.

208
00:19:06,293 --> 00:19:10,035
Little Nemo, to see His Majesty!

209
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,429
(Clears throat)

210
00:19:11,454 --> 00:19:12,623
Your Majesty,

211
00:19:12,648 --> 00:19:14,618
By your royal invitation,

212
00:19:14,643 --> 00:19:20,126
it is my great honor to
present to you... Nemo!

213
00:19:20,979 --> 00:19:21,802
Huh?

214
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,786
Your Majesty?

215
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,808
Oh no, not again!
Wait here.

216
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,401
Search the garden!

217
00:19:32,426 --> 00:19:34,234
And I'll search the palace.

218
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:35,267
Quickly!

219
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:36,841
Yes, Sir!
Right away Sir!

220
00:19:38,064 --> 00:19:39,846
Huh?
What?
Huh?

221
00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:44,984
Maybe he left because we're late.

222
00:19:45,008 --> 00:19:47,005
Ha ha ha ha!

223
00:19:47,137 --> 00:19:49,852
So you was invited,
and now he's stood you up.

224
00:19:49,877 --> 00:19:50,730
Huh?

225
00:19:50,755 --> 00:19:52,667
What luck you have, kid.

226
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:56,237
You're Flip.
You're a frightful fellow.

227
00:19:57,767 --> 00:19:58,693
You got it.

228
00:19:58,718 --> 00:20:01,109
I'm frightfully funny,
frightfully friendly,

229
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:04,222
and l can make your
dreams come true.

230
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:05,995
So ya wanna meet
the King, huh?

231
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,807
Uh-huh.

232
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:08,500
Then leave it to me.

233
00:20:10,566 --> 00:20:12,848
You really know where the King is?

234
00:20:12,873 --> 00:20:15,697
Kid, I know everything.

235
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,300
I am the exclusive,
the one and the only

236
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:20,324
holder of the official map of...

237
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,073
"Nightmare Land"?

238
00:20:26,496 --> 00:20:28,413
Oh, Slumberland.

239
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:29,571
Yep.

240
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,366
C'mon. Let's find the King.
Wait.

241
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:37,569
Don't worry Icarus. I'll bet we'll find
the King before the professor does.

242
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:42,240
Hey, if the furball's got a problem,
leave him behind.

243
00:20:42,386 --> 00:20:45,468
Oh, no no no, there's no problem.
Let's go.

244
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,733
Woah!

245
00:20:49,914 --> 00:20:51,885
Gol-ly!

246
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,626
Just follow me, kid.
Wow...

247
00:20:57,314 --> 00:21:01,470
Satan's waltz!
Yaaay... ohhohh

248
00:21:01,495 --> 00:21:03,571
Everything's upside-down!

249
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:07,298
So it is, yeah.
So it is eh.

250
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:10,540
Unngh-ooh... just do what I do.

251
00:21:10,988 --> 00:21:12,421
Uh-Umph.

252
00:21:12,492 --> 00:21:15,833
All it takes is a little technique, kid.
Watch.

253
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,962
Come on, show a little backbone.

254
00:21:22,524 --> 00:21:28,330
There... eh... there...
arrrgh... woahhh...

255
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,202
Where are we?

256
00:21:56,735 --> 00:21:58,074
Who's that?

257
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,454
Who is that?

258
00:22:11,023 --> 00:22:13,482
Sounds like something's loose...

259
00:22:14,674 --> 00:22:16,140
Maybe it's this.

260
00:22:16,165 --> 00:22:18,282
Nooo.
Then it's that!

261
00:22:18,307 --> 00:22:21,034
No, it's not that grchch!

262
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:22,567
Then what is it?

263
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:24,503
Maybe it's the the piston gasket!

264
00:22:24,528 --> 00:22:26,613
Hmmm, that's right.

265
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:28,417
Wrench.

266
00:22:29,157 --> 00:22:29,865
Wrench.

267
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,929
Screwdriver.

268
00:22:31,065 --> 00:22:31,822
Screwdriver.

269
00:22:31,847 --> 00:22:33,434
Piston gasket.

270
00:22:33,684 --> 00:22:35,684
Piston gasket.

271
00:22:39,645 --> 00:22:40,895
Piston gasket.

272
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,787
Piston gasket. Set in place,
turn, tighten...

273
00:22:44,812 --> 00:22:46,715
Another quarter turn
so it won't leak.

274
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,782
Anything else?

275
00:22:48,013 --> 00:22:50,052
Oil it up, real good.

276
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:57,307
Well I'll be!
It worked!

277
00:22:57,332 --> 00:22:58,932
You're quite a mechanic.

278
00:22:58,957 --> 00:22:59,754
Thanks.

279
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:01,137
l love trains.

280
00:23:01,162 --> 00:23:03,394
Haha, me too!

281
00:23:05,507 --> 00:23:07,528
Hey, be quick because it's leaving!

282
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:10,955
Haha! Come on, quickly now!

283
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,056
Ouch.

284
00:23:15,201 --> 00:23:16,684
Do you think we can catch it?

285
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:19,162
Sure we can. This way.

286
00:23:19,187 --> 00:23:21,342
Here we go!

287
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,570
Hurry!

288
00:23:25,595 --> 00:23:26,714
Where are we going?

289
00:23:27,613 --> 00:23:29,217
Hurry!

290
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,719
Ah hah!

291
00:23:31,752 --> 00:23:33,377
Right on time!

292
00:23:33,878 --> 00:23:35,377
Here she comes!

293
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,603
All aboard!

294
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:41,235
You be the engineer.

295
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,890
Okay. Full throttle!

296
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:04,251
Moo moo moo moooove out

297
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,228
We're coming through!

298
00:24:11,188 --> 00:24:15,399
King Morpheus!
Oh King Morpheus!

299
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,039
Oh... oh...

300
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,938
Out of the way, Professor!

301
00:24:24,161 --> 00:24:27,649
(Laughing)

302
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,301
Oh I haven't had this
much fun in years!

303
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,987
Neither have I!

304
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:35,282
Ouch... ouch
(Clears throat)

305
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,370
Your Majesty, may I
present Little Nemo?

306
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:41,187
Yes, of course, we've met.

307
00:24:41,212 --> 00:24:43,766
You're... Your Majesty?

308
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:44,770
The king?

309
00:24:44,795 --> 00:24:47,166
Oh, let's dispense with the formalities.

310
00:24:47,191 --> 00:24:49,335
Just call me Morphy.

311
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,709
"Morphy"?

312
00:24:50,734 --> 00:24:52,391
M-Morphy?

313
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,422
Uh, Morphy,

314
00:24:58,334 --> 00:25:00,724
Furry little fellow, isn't he?

315
00:25:01,697 --> 00:25:03,906
Now Nemo, my delightful boy.

316
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:08,798

to become my sole heir.

317
00:25:09,013 --> 00:25:10,102
Me, Sir?

318
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,300
Yes, you.

319
00:25:11,507 --> 00:25:14,713
And as my Heir Prince it is
my solemn duty

320
00:25:14,738 --> 00:25:17,930
to give you... the golden key.

321
00:25:17,955 --> 00:25:24,211
With this key you can open
any door in Slumberland.

322
00:25:24,236 --> 00:25:27,200
Wow, thanks, Morphy!

323
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:29,170
But l must warn you...

324
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:33,356
there is one door you must never open.

325
00:25:33,381 --> 00:25:35,811
The door with this symbol.

326
00:25:35,836 --> 00:25:37,845
This, you must promise.

327
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:42,857
And this promise you
must never break.

328
00:25:42,882 --> 00:25:45,579
Y-Yes. l promise.

329
00:25:45,604 --> 00:25:48,055
Sir, l promise you.

330
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,682
Excellent!

331
00:25:49,707 --> 00:25:55,077
Now, Professor, escort my
heir to meet the Princess.

332
00:25:55,078 --> 00:25:55,726
Huh?

333
00:25:55,751 --> 00:25:57,427
Oh yes, yes, Your Majesty.

334
00:25:57,452 --> 00:25:59,495
The Princess?

335
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:12,542
Last stop: The Rosebud Room.
Princess Camille's penthouse.

336
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:15,777

At last.

337
00:26:15,802 --> 00:26:18,395
Now, let's get you tidied up, Nemo.

Hehehe... sorry... heh.

00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,627
Follow me, dear boy,

341
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:29,205
Now, be on your best
behavior young man.

Ahem-what?

366
00:27:59,031 --> 00:28:00,532
Nothing, really.

367
00:28:01,035 --> 00:28:04,777
It's just that no one has ever
accepted a Royal Invitation...

368
00:28:04,802 --> 00:28:07,217
...in his underwear.
(Giggles)

369
00:28:07,242 --> 00:28:10,062
Underwear?
This is NOT my underwear!

00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:07,828
No, I didn't do it!

736
00:54:07,853 --> 00:54:08,683
Flip did it!

737
00:54:08,708 --> 00:54:11,066
But Nemo had the key, I tell ya!

738
00:54:11,091 --> 00:54:12,351
Nemo...?

739
00:54:12,376 --> 00:54:13,714
Nemo?

740
00:54:13,996 --> 00:54:14,945
No!

741
00:54:15,195 --> 00:54:16,994
I-It wasn't me!

742
00:54:17,019 --> 00:54:18,783
It wasn't!

743
00:54:19,219 --> 00:54:20,903
[Crowd] Nemo!

744
00:54:20,928 --> 00:54:22,568
No... no!

745
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:27,942
Nemo... Nemo... Nemo... Nemo!

746
00:54:28,263 --> 00:54:30,535
NOOOO!

747
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:34,768
Phew!

748
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:37,128
Only a dream...

749
00:54:37,363 --> 00:54:38,521
Huh?

750
00:54:38,825 --> 00:54:40,107
Huh?

751
00:54:42,534 --> 00:54:43,644
Huuuhhh?

752
00:54:43,669 --> 00:54:46,265
Nemo...

753
00:54:47,609 --> 00:54:49,609
Nemo...

754
00:54:49,634 --> 00:54:51,663
King Morpheus?

755
00:54:53,755 --> 00:54:55,590
Where are you?

756
00:54:57,551 --> 00:54:58,695
Huh?

757
00:55:01,796 --> 00:55:05,915
Nemo... Nemo...

758
00:55:12,806 --> 00:55:16,583
Nemo... Nemo...

759
00:55:21,913 --> 00:55:24,918
Wa... Help... Help!

760
00:55:27,196 --> 00:55:29,116
Help me!

761
00:55:34,827 --> 00:55:36,918
Noooooooo!

762
00:55:36,942 --> 00:55:38,942
Woah!

763
00:55:46,059 --> 00:55:47,651
Oh no!

764
00:55:47,675 --> 00:55:50,117
Help meeeee....!
(Glug glug)

765
00:55:56,309 --> 00:56:00,046
Heeelllppp!

766
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:25,147
King Morpheus...

767
00:56:25,303 --> 00:56:27,662
(Crying)

768
00:56:29,597 --> 00:56:31,514
I am so sorry

769
00:56:44,541 --> 00:56:45,840
Is that...?

770
00:56:49,761 --> 00:56:52,582
It is! It's the Professor!

771
00:56:52,607 --> 00:56:54,093
Hey Professor!

772
00:56:54,118 --> 00:56:55,686
lt's me, Nemo!

773
00:56:55,711 --> 00:56:56,831
This way!

774
00:56:56,856 --> 00:56:58,505
Over here!

775
00:56:58,530 --> 00:56:59,579
Nemo?

776
00:56:59,643 --> 00:57:00,862
Nemo?!

777
00:57:01,173 --> 00:57:02,596
Professor!

778
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:03,913
It <i>is</i> you!

779
00:57:04,679 --> 00:57:07,087
Grab on! Careful!

780
00:57:07,801 --> 00:57:09,920
Woh... wo-oh...

781
00:57:12,142 --> 00:57:15,922
Nemo! I feared we'd seen the last of you!

782
00:57:15,947 --> 00:57:17,653
Where's King Morpheus?

783
00:57:17,905 --> 00:57:19,302
Far away.

784
00:57:19,475 --> 00:57:21,917
He's been taken away to Nightmare Land.

785
00:57:22,138 --> 00:57:24,681
All of Slumberland weeps for him.

786
00:57:25,063 --> 00:57:26,313
Because of me.

787
00:57:26,338 --> 00:57:27,752
It's all my fault.

788
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:30,735
No, no dear boy,
don't blame yourself.

789
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,518
It's Flip's fault.

790
00:57:32,543 --> 00:57:35,700
No! It was me who made
the promise to the King...

791
00:57:35,725 --> 00:57:38,178
...and it was me who broke it.

792
00:57:38,407 --> 00:57:40,449
I'm going to look for the King.

793
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:46,462
But, without the Royal Sceptre, well,
there's just no hope of saving him.

794
00:57:46,812 --> 00:57:48,352
The Royal Sceptre?

795
00:57:48,594 --> 00:57:50,125
l've got it right here!

796
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:50,880
See?

797
00:57:50,905 --> 00:57:53,131
Why, so you have, my boy!

798
00:57:53,156 --> 00:57:55,944
We must take it to him right away!

799
00:57:55,969 --> 00:57:57,389
Oh, no!

800
00:57:57,766 --> 00:58:00,891
None of us knows just
where Nightmare Land is.

801
00:58:01,092 --> 00:58:03,959
Flip does! He's got a map
to Nightmare Land.

802
00:58:04,115 --> 00:58:05,247
He does?

803
00:58:05,272 --> 00:58:06,207
l saw it.

804
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:08,880
Oh dear, it might be too late.

805
00:58:09,037 --> 00:58:12,257
He's to be banished into space
in a very short time.

806
00:58:12,348 --> 00:58:15,593
We've gotta stop it!
We've gotta hurry!

807
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:17,928
Paddle, Professor, paddle!

808
00:58:17,953 --> 00:58:22,661
Paddle? Yes... uh...
w-why yes, indeed!

809
00:58:37,809 --> 00:58:40,150
Blindfold? Are you kidding?!

810
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,634
I wanna enjoy the show!

811
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:44,714
Ready the cannon!

812
00:58:44,924 --> 00:58:45,613

00:58:45,638 --> 00:58:47,042
Hey, waddya... waddya all doin'?

814
00:58:47,043 --> 00:58:48,246

It's... it's still lit!

816
00:58:56,667 --> 00:58:58,668
Hey... (cough)... lemme outta here!

817
00:58:58,926 --> 00:59:00,453

00:59:00,478 --> 00:59:03,104

00:59:03,129 --> 00:59:06,141
Trust me... woooow!

820
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:07,615
Ready!

821
00:59:08,497 --> 00:59:11,424
Let's go!
Whoops... hurry!

822
00:59:11,612 --> 00:59:13,925
You... must... stop the cannon!

823
00:59:15,629 --> 00:59:17,055
Fire!

824
00:59:20,971 --> 00:59:23,772
lcarus! Where did you come from?

825
00:59:24,335 --> 00:59:25,436
Where's Nemo?

826
00:59:25,897 --> 00:59:28,178
Stop! Stop!

827
00:59:28,202 --> 00:59:29,148
STOP!

828
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:31,238
Don't fire the cannon!

829
00:59:31,263 --> 00:59:32,230
Nemo!

830
00:59:32,255 --> 00:59:33,858
The Royal Sceptre!

831
00:59:33,883 --> 00:59:35,228
Let Flip out!

832
00:59:35,253 --> 00:59:35,972
What?!

833
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,925
l'm gonna look for your father.

834
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,911
So please, let Flip out.

835
00:59:40,936 --> 00:59:41,999
But what?

836
00:59:43,055 --> 00:59:45,391
He has a map of Nightmare Land.

837
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:48,791
Release him!

838
00:59:48,816 --> 00:59:55,352
Phew... yikes... woooah...
woooah... weh-weht!

839
00:59:55,874 --> 01:00:00,262
(Flip coughing)

840
01:00:00,442 --> 01:00:04,198
Hey fellas, watch the Tweeds!

841
01:00:04,417 --> 01:00:06,494
Huh?
Alright, hand it over, Flip.

842
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:07,635
Hand over what?

843
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:09,273
The map of Nightmare Land.

844
01:00:09,298 --> 01:00:11,180
Oh, that little thing.

845
01:00:11,561 --> 01:00:14,413
So... ah... what's it worth to ya?

846
01:00:14,437 --> 01:00:15,389
Flip!

847
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:16,644
Seize it!

848
01:00:16,669 --> 01:00:21,322
Yeah, I sees it Professor.
Here... here, it's yours!

849
01:00:21,347 --> 01:00:22,957
Easy, easy with that!

850
01:00:22,981 --> 01:00:26,376
Hey! Not so rough, you guys!

851
01:00:26,401 --> 01:00:27,712
Interesting, ain't it?

852
01:00:27,737 --> 01:00:29,765
It... doesn't make any sense.

853
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:32,479
Oh, didn't I mention?

854
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:39,684
It's written in my very own special
uniquely inscrutably incomprehensible
and otherwise unreadable super code!

855
01:00:39,709 --> 01:00:42,368
It is, huh?
Well, then you're coming with us.

856
01:00:42,393 --> 01:00:44,407
Me? To Nightmare Land?

857
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:49,636
Sorry. Sorry, but I've got
things to do, places to go,
people to...

858
01:00:49,661 --> 01:00:51,562
Prepare the cannon!

859
01:00:51,587 --> 01:00:55,406
On, uh, second thought,
I'll come along...

860
01:00:55,431 --> 01:00:57,989
If I get to be Captain,
I mean, after all,

861
01:00:58,014 --> 01:01:00,175
l'm the only one who
could read the map.

862
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,967
And do you want to come
along too, little princessy?

863
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:06,874
I'll even let you carry my cigars!
Hahahaha!

864
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:14,347
Did anyone ever tell you, you're
kind of cute when you're angry?

865
01:01:15,526 --> 01:01:17,728
Huh?
Hoh!
Huhh?

866
01:01:19,405 --> 01:01:21,035
Of course l'm coming!

867
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:26,838

Where are we?

893
01:03:47,018 --> 01:03:50,695
By the looks of it, I'd say
we're in Nightmare Land.

894
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:54,045
We are? Oh... I-I mean
of course we are.

Ah-hah! They <i>are</i> scared
of the Royal Sceptre!

905

01:04:33,426 --> 01:04:35,795
We must move on before
more of them spot us!

909
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:39,087
OK, OK, don't get pushy, Professor.

910
01:04:39,111 --> 01:04:40,869
Uh-oh...
What's wrong, Flip?

911
01:04:40,894 --> 01:04:43,688
Wrong? Ahahaha nothin'.
Nothin'! Uh...

912
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:46,447
My map says... that way.

913
01:04:47,325 --> 01:04:52,452
Keep your eyes peeled... we want
to see them before they see us!

914

Ahh... Ahh.... Ooooohhh

915
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:08,351
This place is too spooky.
I don't like it.

916
01:05:08,376 --> 01:05:11,941
Flip, are there any...
are there any

1103
01:13:31,937 --> 01:13:34,345
It's the secret to use the Sceptre.

1104
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:38,115
It's got super power, enough to
defeat the Nightmare King.

Wow, that's great!

1106
