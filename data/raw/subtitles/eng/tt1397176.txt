00:00:40,334 --> 00:00:44,083
SPHINX - OFF LIMITS

2
00:02:39,468 --> 00:02:40,509
Good evening.

3
00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:00,010
-- The CollectorZ --
2010

4
00:03:03,753 --> 00:03:05,502
- Who's in back?
- New guy.

5
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:08,009
- Met him yet?
- Yeah, seems nice.

6
00:03:08,073 --> 00:03:09,947
- From where?
- CÃ´te d'Azur.

7
00:03:10,193 --> 00:03:12,192
Disciplinary transfer.

8
00:03:12,274 --> 00:03:14,148
- What'd he do?
- No idea.

9
00:03:23,754 --> 00:03:26,003
Hey, there. This is Julie.

10
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:27,949
- Simon.
- Nice to meet you.

11
00:03:27,996 --> 00:03:29,495
Done nights yet?

12
00:03:29,636 --> 00:03:31,010
No, it's my first.

13
00:03:35,075 --> 00:03:36,157
Let's roll!

14
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,562
Thank you, sir.

15
00:03:53,278 --> 00:03:54,569
Now go home.

16
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,781
We'll come back to see
if they've gone.

17
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,804
Oh, yeah...

18
00:04:13,842 --> 00:04:15,674
I have a little girl.

19
00:04:16,602 --> 00:04:17,809
That's her.

20
00:04:18,002 --> 00:04:19,293
Adorable, how old?

21
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:21,236
Three, talks up a storm.

22
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,610
A knockout.

23
00:04:23,202 --> 00:04:24,326
Got kids?

24
00:04:24,402 --> 00:04:26,776
Never got around to it.

25
00:04:27,045 --> 00:04:27,877
You?

26
00:04:28,243 --> 00:04:31,367
Soon as a guy finds out
I'm a cop, he splits.

27
00:04:31,442 --> 00:04:33,233
Gimme a break!

28
00:04:33,484 --> 00:04:36,275
For us it's the opposite,
girls love the uniform.

29
00:04:36,283 --> 00:04:37,740
I hadn't noticed.

30
00:04:38,164 --> 00:04:40,663
Stop, don't bullshit me.

31
00:04:40,725 --> 00:04:42,974
You've never... you know?

32
00:04:45,164 --> 00:04:46,413
Hold on.

33
00:04:50,326 --> 00:04:52,950
Car 14 on the way.

34
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:07,172
Evening, sir.

35
00:05:07,328 --> 00:05:09,619
- About time!
- What's the trouble?

36
00:05:09,728 --> 00:05:11,644
What does it look like?

37
00:05:14,287 --> 00:05:16,203
20 years down the drain!

38
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,748
Calm down, sir.
It's no use yelling.

39
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:20,890
This is the third time!

40
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,137
Aren't you insured?

41
00:05:22,251 --> 00:05:26,250
It's a quiet area.
Wealthy, low crime.

42
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,657
Even burglaries are rare.

43
00:05:29,771 --> 00:05:31,395
Been a cop long?

44
00:05:31,971 --> 00:05:33,803
9 years, how about you?

45
00:05:33,891 --> 00:05:34,890
Seven.

46
00:05:41,572 --> 00:05:42,654
Want one?

47
00:05:42,772 --> 00:05:43,896
What are you doing?

48
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:45,969
It won't kill him.

49
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,595
Plus, he's unfriendly.

50
00:05:48,372 --> 00:05:50,788
Don't start, I'm warning you.

51
00:05:50,812 --> 00:05:52,894
Julie? Noise complaint.

52
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,207
Evening.

53
00:06:15,297 --> 00:06:17,004
- Where?
- 3rd floor.

54
00:06:17,097 --> 00:06:20,054
He's not the type.
He won't even open the door.

55
00:06:20,177 --> 00:06:22,468
Careful, he's not just anyone.

56
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:25,413
Excuse me.

57
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:40,553
Police! Open up!

58
00:06:58,142 --> 00:06:59,349
Drop your weapon!

59
00:06:59,942 --> 00:07:01,691
Drop it goddamn it!

60
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:02,863
Do it now!

61
00:07:17,183 --> 00:07:18,307
What's that?

62
00:07:34,586 --> 00:07:35,585
You OK?

63
00:07:35,828 --> 00:07:36,702
Yes.

64
00:07:39,387 --> 00:07:41,428
- More coffee?
- No, thanks.

65
00:07:41,787 --> 00:07:43,286
You can count on me.

66
00:07:44,668 --> 00:07:46,584
You're always welcome.

67
00:07:46,948 --> 00:07:48,364
Take some time off.

68
00:07:48,508 --> 00:07:50,257
I'd rather keep working.

69
00:07:51,068 --> 00:07:52,442
Come in, miss.

70
00:08:00,031 --> 00:08:02,780
An officer down
and a civilian wounded.

71
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:05,178
Keep it quiet for now.

72
00:08:07,511 --> 00:08:08,760
Will you be alright?

73
00:08:09,271 --> 00:08:10,562
Holding up?

74
00:08:11,071 --> 00:08:11,987
It's not easy.

75
00:08:12,152 --> 00:08:13,318
I know.

76
00:08:13,872 --> 00:08:15,829
It's a dirty job.

77
00:08:17,672 --> 00:08:19,546
But we're here for you.

78
00:08:25,273 --> 00:08:28,355
I'm taking you both off the street.

79
00:08:28,713 --> 00:08:30,504
There's free counseling.

80
00:08:32,115 --> 00:08:34,239
It's recommended,

81
00:08:34,354 --> 00:08:36,645
if you want your gun back.

82
00:08:37,353 --> 00:08:40,644
Why?
Think I'll go on a shooting spree?

83
00:08:40,876 --> 00:08:43,375
No, blow your brains out.

84
00:08:44,235 --> 00:08:45,734
Look, forget it.

85
00:08:46,756 --> 00:08:49,380
You'll like your new job.

86
00:08:49,877 --> 00:08:54,501
Desk work is the fast track
to success in the Department.

87
00:08:57,317 --> 00:08:58,191
Yeah?

88
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:03,915
Thank you.

89
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:09,120
Perfect.

90
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:13,700
Now just sign your statement.

91
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:16,985
Statement? I was never questioned.

92
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,087
The kid you shot's father
is a congressman.

93
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:28,165
That means
his gun fired accidentally.

94
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,367
Accidentally?

95
00:09:31,641 --> 00:09:34,223
Was the dope we found an accident?

96
00:09:34,882 --> 00:09:36,381
There was no dope.

97
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:39,166
That stuff killed Bastien!

98
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,702
He was so wasted!

99
00:09:41,483 --> 00:09:44,732
Hurry, it's late.
Your partner's already signed.

100
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,083
Let's go.

101
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:18,007
Thank you.

102
00:10:28,247 --> 00:10:30,788
Want to spend the night?

103
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,242
The kids love seeing you.

104
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,329
No thanks, Gilbert.
I'd rather be alone.

105
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:40,365
How's he taking it?

106
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,096
He won't talk about it.

107
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,012
Be right back.

108
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,033
- You OK?
- I guess.

109
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:02,508
How's the kid?

110
00:11:02,613 --> 00:11:03,945
He's in a coma.

111
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:06,136
It could go either way.

112
00:11:06,813 --> 00:11:08,770
It would be bad if he died.

113
00:11:13,414 --> 00:11:16,663
What do I tell his family?
I can't lie to them.

114
00:11:16,774 --> 00:11:18,523
The brass will do it.

115
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,154
I'd rather it be me.

116
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,680
I know them well.

117
00:11:26,976 --> 00:11:28,350
Want me to come?

118
00:11:29,378 --> 00:11:31,460
No thanks, I'll be fine.

119
00:11:32,937 --> 00:11:34,103
Your choice.

120
00:12:23,703 --> 00:12:25,869
Seen her much since the shooting?

121
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:27,236
No more than usual.

122
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,183
Ever use your gun before?

123
00:12:33,706 --> 00:12:34,580
Yes.

124
00:12:34,784 --> 00:12:36,408
I'd never fired it.

125
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:42,657
Your report states Officer Lafarge
was killed accidentally.

126
00:12:42,665 --> 00:12:43,456
Yes.

127
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,832
And your partner returned fire.

128
00:12:46,907 --> 00:12:48,114
Exactly.

129
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,166
Right, we have a problem.

130
00:12:54,227 --> 00:12:55,351
Why?

131
00:12:56,228 --> 00:12:58,894
The kid woke up claiming
police brutality.

132
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:00,768
Says you shot first.

133
00:13:00,828 --> 00:13:04,202
Brutality!
He opened the door and fired.

134
00:13:04,189 --> 00:13:05,938
He was high as a kite.

135
00:13:06,108 --> 00:13:08,982
The detectives found no drugs
on the scene.

136
00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:11,110
You know who his father is!

137
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:13,577
So?

138
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,292
I was asked to stay quiet,

139
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:17,720
but I saw the dope damn it!

140
00:13:22,431 --> 00:13:25,430
This case is a strain on all of us,

141
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,676
but you stand to lose your job.

142
00:13:28,672 --> 00:13:31,171
If you want to keep your badge,

143
00:13:31,192 --> 00:13:34,899
stick to your report
and forget about the drugs.

144
00:13:36,472 --> 00:13:38,346
What if it costs me?

145
00:13:39,472 --> 00:13:41,471
It very well could.

146
00:13:45,714 --> 00:13:47,838
I think they'll shut you up.

147
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,968
And go with the brat's story.

148
00:13:51,074 --> 00:13:52,365
I agree.

149
00:13:52,435 --> 00:13:55,642
I won't take a brutality charge
sitting down.

150
00:13:55,796 --> 00:13:57,420
Police work's my life.

151
00:13:57,555 --> 00:13:59,054
We need a lawyer.

152
00:13:59,395 --> 00:14:00,894
It won't help.

153
00:14:01,077 --> 00:14:04,951
You can't fight City Hall.
Your word's not good enough.

154
00:14:05,356 --> 00:14:06,730
What, then?

155
00:14:08,277 --> 00:14:11,359
If the kid was high, prove it.

156
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:14,017
Track those pills to his dealer.

157
00:14:14,357 --> 00:14:17,606
Do what's necessary.
I won't let them fire you.

158
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,836
So you have our backs?

159
00:14:20,758 --> 00:14:23,215
Bring me proof, I'll do the rest.

160
00:14:30,961 --> 00:14:32,335
What do you think?

161
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,989
It's worth a try.

162
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,244
Anyway, we have no choice.

163
00:14:58,442 --> 00:15:00,941
It's not my problem!

164
00:15:02,524 --> 00:15:05,106
Another 2 hours overtime!

165
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:07,164
I've had it, I'm going home.

166
00:15:11,405 --> 00:15:12,904
What are you doing?

167
00:15:13,325 --> 00:15:14,699
Narcotics case.

168
00:15:14,766 --> 00:15:17,973
I got lost.
I'm terrible with computers.

169
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:20,003
Hurry, work's piling up.

170
00:15:20,046 --> 00:15:21,420
Don't worry. Night.

171
00:15:21,565 --> 00:15:22,356
Night.

172
00:15:22,526 --> 00:15:23,900
Bye Michel.

173
00:15:24,566 --> 00:15:26,482
Leaving so early, Sandrine?

174
00:15:29,767 --> 00:15:30,891
Miss?

175
00:15:31,527 --> 00:15:35,318
Make a list of these
credit card numbers.

176
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:37,841
Hurry up, it's urgent.

177
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:46,353
The counterfeiters must have
heard about the bust.

178
00:16:05,612 --> 00:16:07,153
Got a second?

179
00:16:07,892 --> 00:16:08,933
Do I know you?

180
00:16:09,612 --> 00:16:12,111
- What do you want?
- Something special.

181
00:16:13,052 --> 00:16:14,051
Such as?

182
00:16:14,613 --> 00:16:16,237
The glow in the dark pills.

183
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,891
You're looking for Sphinx.

184
00:16:19,334 --> 00:16:23,833
No, I don't have any.
Heard about it though, strong stuff.

185
00:16:24,094 --> 00:16:25,760
But I can offer you...

186
00:16:26,535 --> 00:16:29,284
- Jokers, BM, Crystal...
- Forget it!

187
00:16:34,216 --> 00:16:35,465
Seen Stephanie?

188
00:16:39,256 --> 00:16:41,255
Is this where you heard about it?

189
00:16:41,496 --> 00:16:43,120
Get lost, buddy.

190
00:16:57,378 --> 00:16:58,752
You partying?

191
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,442
Sphinx, heard of it?

192
00:17:00,498 --> 00:17:02,372
Yes. Come with me.

193
00:17:09,698 --> 00:17:10,614
Move!

194
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:23,218
Here.

195
00:17:26,183 --> 00:17:28,432
Listed and ready for the locker.

196
00:17:35,423 --> 00:17:37,130
Good work, miss.

197
00:17:47,785 --> 00:17:49,117
What did you take?

198
00:17:49,706 --> 00:17:51,163
Tell me!

199
00:17:51,386 --> 00:17:52,968
I'm talking to you!

200
00:18:08,069 --> 00:18:09,776
Don't resist!

201
00:18:15,268 --> 00:18:16,225
You OK?

202
00:18:16,589 --> 00:18:18,046
Yes.

203
00:18:18,988 --> 00:18:22,112
Pick these up,
put them in the locker.

204
00:18:22,709 --> 00:18:24,291
I'll go see the nurse.

205
00:18:50,511 --> 00:18:51,927
Come inside.

206
00:18:53,192 --> 00:18:54,274
Sit down.

207
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,382
What do you want?

208
00:19:05,674 --> 00:19:06,548
Sphinx.

209
00:19:06,634 --> 00:19:08,591
No problem. You'll see,

210
00:19:08,676 --> 00:19:10,633
it'll blow your mind.

211
00:19:17,196 --> 00:19:18,653
That's not it.

212
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,339
The incandescent pills.

213
00:19:20,997 --> 00:19:23,788
I guarantee this will give you

214
00:19:23,876 --> 00:19:25,500
the high of your life.

215
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:27,706
Sorry, not interested.

216
00:19:28,718 --> 00:19:29,592
How many?

217
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,376
I said no deal.

218
00:19:31,478 --> 00:19:32,977
Get out!

219
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,338
Gimme back the joint.

220
00:19:41,921 --> 00:19:44,670
Rich kid with no record,
like the first.

221
00:19:45,879 --> 00:19:47,586
He had two on him.

222
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,584
He was driving against traffic
on the belt.

223
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,936
Could be.

224
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,116
He had the same wild eyes
as the first.

225
00:20:01,482 --> 00:20:04,481
He got rough with some
guests at the Shakma.

226
00:20:04,562 --> 00:20:06,853
It's a new club. Check it out.

227
00:20:06,882 --> 00:20:08,464
Evening, Captain.

228
00:20:09,481 --> 00:20:12,772
See you later then?
Come by my desk.

229
00:21:27,413 --> 00:21:28,787
Looking for someone?

230
00:21:28,852 --> 00:21:31,351
A friend to help me out.

231
00:21:31,853 --> 00:21:33,227
With what?

232
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:36,024
Does Sphinx ring a bell?

233
00:21:36,493 --> 00:21:37,784
Who told you?

234
00:21:37,854 --> 00:21:39,436
A co-worker.

235
00:21:39,773 --> 00:21:41,772
It's rare, it's pricey.

236
00:21:41,815 --> 00:21:43,189
I'll pay.

237
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:46,234
I don't have any. How about ecstasy?

238
00:21:46,497 --> 00:21:48,746
No, I want Sphinx.

239
00:21:48,855 --> 00:21:50,146
Can you get some?

240
00:21:50,295 --> 00:21:53,169
You really are hooked.
What's your name?

241
00:21:53,456 --> 00:21:54,455
Simon.

242
00:21:54,776 --> 00:21:56,025
Want my number?

243
00:21:56,896 --> 00:21:57,770
No.

244
00:22:22,499 --> 00:22:24,248
I can get some.

245
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:25,918
Oh, there you are.

246
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,104
Got a second?

247
00:22:27,261 --> 00:22:29,010
I'll meet you at the bar.

248
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,292
I'm not gonna make a run
for a few pills.

249
00:22:32,699 --> 00:22:33,823
How many you want?

250
00:22:34,262 --> 00:22:36,011
Depends on how much.

251
00:22:36,141 --> 00:22:38,807
You didn't say how many.

252
00:22:39,662 --> 00:22:41,161
Fifty to start.

253
00:22:41,662 --> 00:22:42,828
Fifty?

254
00:22:45,142 --> 00:22:46,891
More, if it's good.

255
00:22:49,143 --> 00:22:51,017
I've got friends.

256
00:23:50,831 --> 00:23:52,330
Is he our man?

257
00:23:52,591 --> 00:23:55,632
His customers fit the profile.

258
00:23:55,632 --> 00:23:56,839
It's a good lead.

259
00:23:56,952 --> 00:23:58,159
When's the meeting?

260
00:23:58,273 --> 00:24:00,022
This afternoon.

261
00:24:00,192 --> 00:24:02,066
He only sells by the hundred.

262
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,814
That's 1,000 euros.

263
00:24:07,394 --> 00:24:11,143
If I want him to trust me,
I have to pay.

264
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,449
But I'm broke.

265
00:24:14,193 --> 00:24:15,734
I'll see what I can do.

266
00:24:19,474 --> 00:24:21,640
- See you later?
- Good luck.

267
00:24:22,036 --> 00:24:22,993
Hello.

268
00:24:26,475 --> 00:24:27,474
Still here?

269
00:24:27,635 --> 00:24:29,926
We were discussing our case.

270
00:24:30,195 --> 00:24:31,444
You two together?

271
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,468
What?

272
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,220
Are you an item?

273
00:24:34,277 --> 00:24:35,026
No, why?

274
00:24:35,116 --> 00:24:38,990
Because I read his file.
He's violent, watch out.

275
00:24:41,957 --> 00:24:42,831
Bye.

276
00:24:50,358 --> 00:24:53,232
You bet I'll have the money.
See you then.

277
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,928
A year's savings.
I'm coming too.

278
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:02,580
No, he's paranoid.
He won't like it.

279
00:25:02,681 --> 00:25:04,722
- Be careful.
- Don't worry.

280
00:25:05,441 --> 00:25:08,357
- Where do we meet?
- I'll send you my address.

281
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,669
It's on the house.

282
00:25:49,527 --> 00:25:50,901
Not now.

283
00:25:51,207 --> 00:25:53,581
Go on, you're making me suspicious.

284
00:26:04,528 --> 00:26:07,277
What's your line of work?

285
00:26:07,367 --> 00:26:09,408
I'm an exec at a big firm.

286
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,643
Do you use for work or fun?

287
00:26:12,689 --> 00:26:13,771
Both.

288
00:26:14,689 --> 00:26:16,688
Gotta handle the pressure.

289
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:19,973
Lots of us take speed.

290
00:26:20,729 --> 00:26:23,436
The guy with the best product wins.

291
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,239
You'll leave the others
in the dust.

292
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,224
It's not cheap.

293
00:26:28,411 --> 00:26:29,910
But it's worth it.

294
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,107
It works fast.

295
00:26:35,013 --> 00:26:36,262
It kicks ass.

296
00:26:36,412 --> 00:26:37,286
I know.

297
00:26:40,292 --> 00:26:42,916
A friend went ballistic
on this stuff.

298
00:26:43,253 --> 00:26:44,127
Really?

299
00:26:44,613 --> 00:26:46,862
Know him? A politician's son.

300
00:26:49,373 --> 00:26:50,789
What do you care?

301
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:54,068
Nothing. Forget it.

302
00:26:57,774 --> 00:26:58,648
Come on.

303
00:26:59,814 --> 00:27:01,480
Someplace quiet.

304
00:27:01,896 --> 00:27:03,853
I want you to meet someone.

305
00:27:10,777 --> 00:27:14,901
I'll leave you here.
Keep walking, you'll see Patrick.

306
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:25,457
Hey.

307
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:29,165
- Got the money?
- Yeah.

308
00:27:36,418 --> 00:27:38,334
- Where they from?
- You cool?

309
00:27:38,379 --> 00:27:39,878
- Yeah, but...
- Get lost!

310
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,921
- Can I call you?
- No.

311
00:27:41,981 --> 00:27:43,730
What if I run out?

312
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,904
Who supplies you?
Where do the Sphinx come from?

313
00:27:48,461 --> 00:27:50,085
Why all the questions?

314
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,481
You a cop?

315
00:27:54,542 --> 00:27:58,041
I smell you, pig!
Wanna play hardball, huh?

316
00:27:58,662 --> 00:27:59,619
You're a cop!

317
00:27:59,862 --> 00:28:01,111
You reek!

318
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,976
Does it sting?

319
00:29:08,151 --> 00:29:09,983
I barely feel a thing.

320
00:29:10,072 --> 00:29:11,571
Stop squirming then.

321
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,586
I should have come with you.

322
00:29:18,233 --> 00:29:19,857
Get off me!

323
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,186
Want a sleeping pill?

324
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,658
I'm turning myself in.

325
00:30:30,841 --> 00:30:32,673
Calm down. We'll see.

326
00:30:33,482 --> 00:30:37,606
Easy for you to say!
How can I be calm?

327
00:30:38,043 --> 00:30:40,875
- I'm all mixed-up!
- There are two of us!

328
00:30:41,484 --> 00:30:44,150
If you turn yourself in
you'll go to jail!

329
00:30:45,484 --> 00:30:46,983
Got a better idea?

330
00:30:47,964 --> 00:30:49,005
We continue.

331
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:51,057
What?

332
00:30:51,606 --> 00:30:54,688
I'm a killer and a cop.
Why continue?

333
00:30:56,123 --> 00:30:57,539
So I won't be alone.

334
00:31:03,606 --> 00:31:04,938
We find the supplier,

335
00:31:05,046 --> 00:31:07,378
then see what Gilbert can do.

336
00:31:15,008 --> 00:31:16,257
I don't know.

337
00:31:53,131 --> 00:31:54,172
It's me.

338
00:31:54,732 --> 00:31:56,731
There may be a way.

339
00:31:56,853 --> 00:31:58,394
So you're with me?

340
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:01,832
Go on, I'm listening.

341
00:32:02,493 --> 00:32:05,659
I'll explain tonight
after your shift.

342
00:32:18,856 --> 00:32:19,980
Maxime?

343
00:32:20,137 --> 00:32:22,761
Going home alone?

344
00:32:23,297 --> 00:32:26,796
Come with me.
I've got something you'll love.

345
00:32:27,456 --> 00:32:29,497
You'd better drive though.

346
00:32:49,819 --> 00:32:51,026
Gilbert?

347
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,844
It's Julie. Can you find the
vehicle with plates:

348
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,734
817 MWH 75.

349
00:33:00,982 --> 00:33:03,106
It's nothing. Don't worry.

350
00:33:15,143 --> 00:33:16,850
Open up!

351
00:33:18,703 --> 00:33:19,827
What's that?

352
00:33:19,943 --> 00:33:22,192
What is it?

353
00:33:23,303 --> 00:33:26,010
What are you trying to pull?

354
00:33:28,105 --> 00:33:29,979
You weren't expecting me, huh?

355
00:33:37,466 --> 00:33:38,715
Get lost.

356
00:33:39,266 --> 00:33:41,098
Go!

357
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:50,486
Why all this cash?

358
00:33:52,107 --> 00:33:54,481
Stocking up for the winter?

359
00:33:55,948 --> 00:33:57,030
And this?

360
00:34:07,108 --> 00:34:09,732
I didn't know he would rip you off.

361
00:34:09,749 --> 00:34:10,748
Oh, yeah?

362
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:15,251
- Where's the Sphinx from?
- What?

363
00:34:18,631 --> 00:34:21,130
- Who's the supplier?
- I don't know!

364
00:34:23,791 --> 00:34:26,665
Look, either you go to jail tonight

365
00:34:26,752 --> 00:34:28,126
for at least 10 years,

366
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,606
or you talk and you're a free man.

367
00:34:32,192 --> 00:34:32,941
Come on!

368
00:34:33,033 --> 00:34:34,282
I don't know.

369
00:34:40,073 --> 00:34:41,739
OK, stop!

370
00:34:43,234 --> 00:34:46,358
The supplier's named Marc.
They met in prison.

371
00:34:46,434 --> 00:34:48,725
That's all I know!

372
00:34:51,874 --> 00:34:52,831
That's better.

373
00:34:53,795 --> 00:34:55,544
Vanish, OK?

374
00:35:01,076 --> 00:35:04,075
- Talk and you're dead!
- I won't talk.

375
00:35:13,918 --> 00:35:14,959
Keep walking.

376
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,244
All clear.

377
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,084
We need a place to stash it.

378
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,327
I know a scheme from back home.

379
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,524
What is it?

380
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:41,053
Get the keys
to a sealed-off apartment.

381
00:35:41,081 --> 00:35:42,455
We need a car, too.

382
00:35:42,761 --> 00:35:45,760
You do it,
I'm about to lose my license.

383
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:47,435
I see.

384
00:35:47,803 --> 00:35:49,177
Come on!

385
00:35:54,884 --> 00:35:56,258
Out for pizza.

386
00:35:56,324 --> 00:35:57,323
Right.

387
00:35:57,883 --> 00:35:58,757
Enjoy.

388
00:36:22,366 --> 00:36:23,448
Excuse me?

389
00:36:28,129 --> 00:36:29,628
Anyone here?

390
00:36:44,449 --> 00:36:45,448
You, here?

391
00:36:45,608 --> 00:36:48,107
I was gathering information
for our case.

392
00:36:48,649 --> 00:36:50,148
I'll look the other way.

393
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:53,029
But keep your head.

394
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,044
Don't worry.

395
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,169
Excuse me?

396
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:01,631
I'm looking for Mr. Brunel
for an identification.

397
00:37:02,451 --> 00:37:03,700
3rd floor.

398
00:37:03,771 --> 00:37:04,728
Thanks.

399
00:37:08,213 --> 00:37:09,712
What are you doing here?

400
00:37:09,893 --> 00:37:11,142
Get to work!

401
00:37:12,013 --> 00:37:13,554
When do I get out?

402
00:37:13,613 --> 00:37:16,070
Don't make me come over there!

403
00:37:25,734 --> 00:37:28,233
- I got you a taco.
- No, thanks.

404
00:37:28,334 --> 00:37:30,125
- Not even a bite?
- No.

405
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:33,632
I'm looking for Agent Brunel.

406
00:37:34,256 --> 00:37:36,255
Last door on your right.

407
00:37:47,938 --> 00:37:49,687
Yes, a wiretap.

408
00:37:50,457 --> 00:37:53,456
They're raising
a big sum for next week.

409
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,376
Why the apartment schemes?

410
00:38:09,499 --> 00:38:10,790
For girls?

411
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,596
No, to play cards.

412
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,492
Right!

413
00:38:14,101 --> 00:38:15,475
I'm serious.

414
00:38:15,981 --> 00:38:17,730
That why you were transferred?

415
00:38:18,141 --> 00:38:19,807
I hit a superior.

416
00:38:21,621 --> 00:38:22,787
He deserved it.

417
00:39:12,789 --> 00:39:14,663
So, like it?

418
00:39:14,709 --> 00:39:15,916
It's huge.

419
00:39:20,829 --> 00:39:22,578
Always want to be a cop?

420
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,235
Runs in the family.

421
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:27,924
Grandad was a cop,
dad was a cop, I'm an only child...

422
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,496
- So you're a cop.
- Yes.

423
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:31,744
You?

424
00:39:32,311 --> 00:39:34,727
It was against my family's wishes.

425
00:39:34,871 --> 00:39:38,370
They're still angry,
but I have no regrets.

426
00:39:38,713 --> 00:39:39,837
I'm happy.

427
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:41,410
Even after all this?

428
00:39:41,832 --> 00:39:42,789
Yeah.

429
00:39:49,633 --> 00:39:51,132
Are we sleeping together?

430
00:39:52,272 --> 00:39:53,521
Not tonight.

431
00:39:54,674 --> 00:39:56,048
Goodnight, then.

432
00:40:07,235 --> 00:40:11,276
Marc Bastide.
Good family, never married.

433
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:16,284
No drug offenses,
but one robbery conviction.

434
00:40:16,835 --> 00:40:19,501
Two years ago
he opened a night club,

435
00:40:19,877 --> 00:40:22,626
"The Link" and several restaurants.

436
00:40:23,077 --> 00:40:25,243
He's always worked with...

437
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:28,587
Someone named Rudy.

438
00:40:30,998 --> 00:40:32,497
He's another story.

439
00:40:32,799 --> 00:40:36,215
He's done time for pimping
and attempted rape.

440
00:40:36,677 --> 00:40:39,176
Well we know what we're up against.

441
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,399
- How much we got?
- 37,000.

442
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,689
And 4 bullets.

443
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,618
I'm bringing the speed.

444
00:40:56,722 --> 00:40:58,971
That'll get his attention.

445
00:40:59,002 --> 00:41:00,626
You mean, actually deal?

446
00:41:02,482 --> 00:41:05,106
You reel them in, I deal.

447
00:41:05,722 --> 00:41:07,804
Okay, if you want.

448
00:41:08,202 --> 00:41:09,576
You wearing that?

449
00:41:10,002 --> 00:41:11,168
Don't like it?

450
00:41:11,324 --> 00:41:12,365
I do...

451
00:41:12,683 --> 00:41:16,057
Very much.
But why not go all the way?

452
00:41:16,404 --> 00:41:17,861
You're right.

453
00:41:18,164 --> 00:41:20,205
I'll find something back here.

454
00:41:36,566 --> 00:41:37,815
You went all out.

455
00:41:37,886 --> 00:41:38,885
I had to.

456
00:41:38,967 --> 00:41:39,966
Get in.

457
00:42:15,211 --> 00:42:18,335
We're going to another party.
Wanna come?

458
00:42:18,692 --> 00:42:20,191
I came with someone.

459
00:42:20,811 --> 00:42:23,852
But if you need a boost,
I can arrange it.

460
00:42:24,332 --> 00:42:25,789
I see.

461
00:42:26,253 --> 00:42:27,585
What do you suggest?

462
00:42:27,933 --> 00:42:30,682
- Speed.
- I've got coke.

463
00:42:31,413 --> 00:42:32,287
Wait...

464
00:42:33,054 --> 00:42:34,095
Luc!

465
00:42:34,414 --> 00:42:35,288
Speed?

466
00:43:16,178 --> 00:43:17,677
We've got a problem.

467
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,474
Get Manu.

468
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,576
What's your name?

469
00:43:29,702 --> 00:43:31,826
That's him. Enjoy.

470
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:32,858
Thanks.

471
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,767
I don't know you,

472
00:43:51,904 --> 00:43:54,528
so let me be crystal clear.

473
00:43:55,024 --> 00:43:57,148
No dealing in my establishments.

474
00:43:57,423 --> 00:43:58,339
Missy.

475
00:43:58,425 --> 00:43:59,632
No dealing, get it?

476
00:43:59,745 --> 00:44:01,744
Next time I call the police.

477
00:44:03,945 --> 00:44:05,569
Get him out of here!

478
00:44:07,425 --> 00:44:08,382
Get lost!

479
00:44:10,786 --> 00:44:11,785
You alright?

480
00:44:15,427 --> 00:44:17,176
Tell Rudy to follow them.

481
00:45:21,115 --> 00:45:24,947
Tonight I go back,
I buy him a drink...

482
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,145
We need a new approach.

483
00:45:34,676 --> 00:45:36,008
Something bolder.

484
00:45:37,997 --> 00:45:40,038
We tell him we want a partnership.

485
00:45:41,757 --> 00:45:43,756
Meet you after work?

486
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:45,538
What time you get off?

487
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:47,176
5 o'clock, you?

488
00:45:47,518 --> 00:45:48,517
Me, too.

489
00:45:48,598 --> 00:45:51,430
Unless Sandrine's late.

490
00:45:58,319 --> 00:45:59,818
We're being followed.

491
00:46:45,606 --> 00:46:49,188
If your boss wants to talk,
he can pick up a phone.

492
00:47:09,128 --> 00:47:11,627
Aren't you in deep enough already?

493
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:14,809
Sorry?

494
00:47:15,809 --> 00:47:18,100
You don't look good lately.

495
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:20,346
It looks suspicious.

496
00:47:23,171 --> 00:47:25,295
What's up with the brutality case?

497
00:47:25,811 --> 00:47:27,810
The kid won't drop charges.

498
00:47:28,289 --> 00:47:32,080
His lawyers have even asked
for a suspension.

499
00:47:32,131 --> 00:47:33,047
Harsh.

500
00:47:33,371 --> 00:47:34,870
What will you decide?

501
00:47:34,933 --> 00:47:37,557
I have to check with my superiors.

502
00:47:37,653 --> 00:47:39,569
But I'm not optimistic.

503
00:47:40,813 --> 00:47:42,812
What will you tell them?

504
00:47:42,853 --> 00:47:44,352
I'll buy time,

505
00:47:44,413 --> 00:47:46,787
promise to intervene.
It will blow over.

506
00:47:46,894 --> 00:47:48,935
You just said it wouldn't.

507
00:47:49,654 --> 00:47:51,445
You know the saying,

508
00:47:51,734 --> 00:47:54,316
"Better injustice than disorder."

509
00:47:55,294 --> 00:47:56,460
The wiretap working?

510
00:47:56,615 --> 00:47:59,656
The counterfeiters
are waiting for passports.

511
00:47:59,735 --> 00:48:02,151
This time we've got them cornered.

512
00:48:02,654 --> 00:48:05,403
I hope they get the slammer!

513
00:48:06,936 --> 00:48:08,310
What about you?

514
00:48:09,256 --> 00:48:10,380
I don't know.

515
00:48:11,977 --> 00:48:13,101
Excuse me.

516
00:48:17,538 --> 00:48:18,537
Speaking.

517
00:48:20,618 --> 00:48:22,784
Sure, let's talk.

518
00:48:23,858 --> 00:48:24,899
Where?

519
00:48:27,259 --> 00:48:29,966
Okay, at our place.

520
00:48:30,259 --> 00:48:31,258
See you tonight.

521
00:48:33,141 --> 00:48:35,765
I noticed your perfume, very chic.

522
00:48:35,859 --> 00:48:36,608
Thanks.

523
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,197
From a sweetheart?

524
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:42,094
Mind your own business.

525
00:48:54,382 --> 00:48:55,631
Watch out for her.

526
00:48:55,823 --> 00:48:56,697
Right.

527
00:48:58,941 --> 00:49:00,148
They're early.

528
00:49:05,905 --> 00:49:08,487
You said you'd put them away.

529
00:49:08,544 --> 00:49:09,668
So, I missed one.

530
00:49:09,823 --> 00:49:11,447
I hope it's the only one.

531
00:49:12,745 --> 00:49:14,369
Stay cool, OK?

532
00:49:14,745 --> 00:49:16,786
Sorry. Go ahead.

533
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:20,663
Evening.

534
00:49:22,785 --> 00:49:23,826
All alone?

535
00:49:23,905 --> 00:49:25,279
Julie's over there.

536
00:49:26,066 --> 00:49:26,940
Good evening.

537
00:49:27,267 --> 00:49:28,266
Evening.

538
00:49:34,707 --> 00:49:36,039
I'll look around.

539
00:49:36,388 --> 00:49:37,470
Go right ahead.

540
00:49:39,227 --> 00:49:40,893
Nice place.

541
00:49:46,428 --> 00:49:47,719
Lots of books.

542
00:49:48,988 --> 00:49:50,862
They're just for show.

543
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:56,837
What did you want to discuss?

544
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:00,527
Let's wait for Rudy.

545
00:50:32,275 --> 00:50:33,399
Look what I found.

546
00:50:37,355 --> 00:50:41,104
See they look like
the literary type.

547
00:50:41,155 --> 00:50:43,071
Who said it was our place?

548
00:50:43,196 --> 00:50:45,820
Don't worry, it's secure.

549
00:50:46,117 --> 00:50:48,991
It belongs to a client on the Coast.

550
00:50:50,437 --> 00:50:52,561
You guys come from the Coast?

551
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:53,832
Yeah.

552
00:50:54,037 --> 00:50:56,286
We came to cut out the middleman.

553
00:50:58,438 --> 00:50:59,729
A little coke?

554
00:51:01,198 --> 00:51:02,322
Why not?

555
00:51:03,038 --> 00:51:04,287
If it's good.

556
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,856
That's for you to judge.

557
00:51:06,118 --> 00:51:07,617
Honey?

558
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:12,761
Have a seat.

559
00:51:41,043 --> 00:51:42,084
Good.

560
00:51:44,085 --> 00:51:45,709
It's top quality.

561
00:51:45,962 --> 00:51:48,003
Our clients want nothing less.

562
00:51:51,764 --> 00:51:53,013
Actually,

563
00:51:54,885 --> 00:51:56,884
I have a proposition to make.

564
00:51:57,765 --> 00:51:59,014
Depends on what.

565
00:52:01,727 --> 00:52:03,101
Amphetamines.

566
00:52:04,567 --> 00:52:05,941
I need new dealers.

567
00:52:06,886 --> 00:52:09,260
I thought you hated dealers!

568
00:52:13,128 --> 00:52:16,252
We don't sell second-rate speed.

569
00:52:19,008 --> 00:52:20,840
You won't be disappointed.

570
00:52:31,009 --> 00:52:32,841
You can come up now.

571
00:52:36,531 --> 00:52:37,780
Impressive.

572
00:52:38,811 --> 00:52:42,435
Can I count you in for 6,000?

573
00:52:43,611 --> 00:52:45,860
That's 1,000 pills.

574
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:50,273
I don't sell less.

575
00:52:52,331 --> 00:52:53,330
Okay.

576
00:52:57,414 --> 00:52:59,913
You keep all your cash here?

577
00:53:00,414 --> 00:53:02,163
Just pocket money.

578
00:53:05,575 --> 00:53:07,532
Your wife is very beautiful.

579
00:53:09,614 --> 00:53:11,530
Can we stick to business?

580
00:53:11,936 --> 00:53:15,060
Where do you get the speed?
Holland, Poland?

581
00:53:16,015 --> 00:53:19,639
It's not where they come from,
it's how many we sell.

582
00:53:21,136 --> 00:53:22,177
Perfect.

583
00:53:26,176 --> 00:53:28,300
You know where to find me.

584
00:54:30,385 --> 00:54:31,676
It's Julie.

585
00:54:32,305 --> 00:54:35,096
Yes, sold out in one week.

586
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:37,071
Can we meet?

587
00:54:39,906 --> 00:54:42,155
Sure, tonight if you want.

588
00:54:42,506 --> 00:54:43,505
That works.

589
00:54:44,306 --> 00:54:45,972
See you then.

590
00:54:46,387 --> 00:54:47,719
We made the bust.

591
00:54:47,827 --> 00:54:50,951
Given the stash,
it'll be a long weekend.

592
00:54:51,668 --> 00:54:53,792
Count it and lock it up.

593
00:54:53,908 --> 00:54:55,574
Julie, come with me.

594
00:55:06,068 --> 00:55:09,025
Captain just called,
he wants to see you.

595
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:11,151
Right away.

596
00:55:12,191 --> 00:55:13,690
What does he want?

597
00:55:15,031 --> 00:55:16,322
He didn't say.

598
00:55:29,071 --> 00:55:30,695
Put them in lock-up.

599
00:55:31,392 --> 00:55:32,141
Get up!

600
00:55:32,312 --> 00:55:34,186
They're all behind bars.

601
00:55:34,633 --> 00:55:37,007
We think it was worth the wait.

602
00:55:37,833 --> 00:55:39,624
You're welcome. Goodbye.

603
00:55:42,315 --> 00:55:43,772
I have some bad news.

604
00:55:43,874 --> 00:55:46,373
I stalled as long as I could.

605
00:55:46,714 --> 00:55:48,963
The family got you suspended.

606
00:55:52,636 --> 00:55:54,010
Starting when?

607
00:55:54,675 --> 00:55:57,674
In two days, effective Monday.

608
00:55:57,797 --> 00:56:00,879
- That sucks!
- I agree, but wait...

609
00:56:01,875 --> 00:56:04,749
The investigation isn't over.
You'll be cleared.

610
00:56:04,957 --> 00:56:07,123
- I guarantee it.
- Yeah, right.

611
00:56:09,397 --> 00:56:11,021
Hey, take it easy!

612
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:13,795
Please!

613
00:56:14,118 --> 00:56:16,242
- Bastards!
- What'd you expect?

614
00:56:16,399 --> 00:56:18,148
Tonight's the night.

615
00:56:52,003 --> 00:56:53,127
Thank you.

616
00:56:54,324 --> 00:56:55,823
Where's your man?

617
00:56:56,004 --> 00:56:57,378
He'll be here.

618
00:56:57,803 --> 00:57:00,427
Usually it's women you wait for.

619
00:57:04,525 --> 00:57:06,149
Been together long?

620
00:57:07,364 --> 00:57:08,863
A little over a year.

621
00:57:09,045 --> 00:57:10,586
Where'd you meet?

622
00:57:11,366 --> 00:57:13,073
In a club in Nice.

623
00:57:27,089 --> 00:57:29,338
What about you? Got someone?

624
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:30,361
No.

625
00:57:31,526 --> 00:57:33,108
Congratulations,

626
00:57:33,328 --> 00:57:35,577
you beat out my other dealers.

627
00:57:39,049 --> 00:57:40,590
Speak of the devil!

628
00:57:41,609 --> 00:57:43,358
- Got the dope?
- No.

629
00:57:44,689 --> 00:57:46,355
This is a social visit.

630
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:50,009
I'm taking you
to meet my associates.

631
00:57:51,091 --> 00:57:52,673
We'll take my car.

632
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:54,634
I'll drive you home.

633
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:57,526
You won't be needing this.

634
00:57:58,851 --> 00:58:00,392
We're just having dinner.

635
00:58:01,052 --> 00:58:02,926
I'll give it back later.

636
00:58:52,778 --> 00:58:54,235
There you are.

637
00:58:57,059 --> 00:58:58,350
We're starving.

638
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:00,499
Christian.

639
00:59:01,178 --> 00:59:03,510
Joseph and his wife Nadine.

640
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:05,080
How do you do?

641
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:09,764
On the Coast,
where do you sell? Clubs?

642
00:59:10,621 --> 00:59:12,037
Occasionally.

643
00:59:12,459 --> 00:59:15,166
Private beach parties, mostly.

644
00:59:15,581 --> 00:59:18,455
Repeat customers who buy in bulk.

645
00:59:18,941 --> 00:59:20,648
What's the drug of choice?

646
00:59:21,423 --> 00:59:23,339
Coke and ecstasy, mainly.

647
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:26,226
But speed's gaining ground.

648
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:27,136
Good.

649
00:59:29,463 --> 00:59:30,754
Go with her.

650
00:59:32,343 --> 00:59:33,759
I'll join you.

651
00:59:41,626 --> 00:59:42,625
So?

652
00:59:45,103 --> 00:59:46,727
Happy with the product?

653
00:59:46,784 --> 00:59:47,783
Yes.

654
00:59:48,186 --> 00:59:49,185
It sells.

655
00:59:50,146 --> 00:59:53,770
Not by our standards.
You need to sell more.

656
00:59:53,745 --> 00:59:54,994
Just say the word.

657
00:59:55,546 --> 00:59:58,920
The next deal is for 60,000 then.

658
00:59:59,388 --> 01:00:01,512
60,000? OK.

659
01:00:01,787 --> 01:00:05,286
We'll see if you can
distribute that much.

660
01:00:05,748 --> 01:00:08,455
We know plenty of dealers
in the South.

661
01:00:10,428 --> 01:00:12,635
I see we think alike.

662
01:00:17,389 --> 01:00:18,388
Try it.

663
01:00:19,069 --> 01:00:20,943
It's marvelous.

664
01:00:34,671 --> 01:00:36,295
Known them long?

665
01:00:36,952 --> 01:00:39,076
I don't get involved in business.

666
01:00:44,352 --> 01:00:45,268
Wait.

667
01:00:55,674 --> 01:00:56,548
Here.

668
01:00:56,994 --> 01:00:57,868
No, thanks.

669
01:00:58,033 --> 01:01:00,449
Go on, lighten up!

670
01:01:00,555 --> 01:01:01,721
I said no.

671
01:01:02,115 --> 01:01:03,239
Where you going?

672
01:01:18,837 --> 01:01:21,086
How's the competition?

673
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:25,732
The Russians took
a bite out of our profits.

674
01:01:26,238 --> 01:01:27,612
Ever been caught?

675
01:01:27,718 --> 01:01:29,342
No, knock on wood.

676
01:01:32,119 --> 01:01:32,993
They're pros.

677
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:34,118
It's me.

678
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:35,808
How's it coming?

679
01:01:38,398 --> 01:01:40,147
We've finished dinner.

680
01:01:40,921 --> 01:01:42,170
See you in a bit.

681
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:45,879
Let's go.

682
01:02:09,923 --> 01:02:11,214
Where are we going?

683
01:02:15,125 --> 01:02:16,999
I'll tell you a secret.

684
01:02:19,805 --> 01:02:22,429
Want to know where
we get the Sphinx?

685
01:02:23,645 --> 01:02:24,519
Yeah.

686
01:02:25,446 --> 01:02:26,695
It's simple.

687
01:02:28,446 --> 01:02:30,028
We produce it ourselves.

688
01:02:33,446 --> 01:02:35,570
What counts is the chemist...

689
01:02:36,128 --> 01:02:38,710
Setting up the lab is easy.

690
01:02:39,007 --> 01:02:43,214
Think big, I say,
or go back to robbing banks.

691
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:48,411
Why tell me all that?

692
01:02:50,529 --> 01:02:52,528
Where are we going?

693
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:55,251
We have a detail to take care of.

694
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:06,651
Follow me.

695
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:08,806
Let's go!

696
01:03:09,731 --> 01:03:11,230
Don't be afraid.

697
01:03:40,294 --> 01:03:41,668
What do you want?

698
01:03:45,015 --> 01:03:48,514
One of our dealers tried
to cheat us.

699
01:03:49,816 --> 01:03:51,440
This wise guy claims

700
01:03:51,975 --> 01:03:54,349
the money he owed us was stolen.

701
01:03:54,376 --> 01:03:56,375
I can't just let it slide.

702
01:03:57,698 --> 01:03:59,614
What's that got to do with us?

703
01:03:59,976 --> 01:04:00,892
Stan?

704
01:04:03,738 --> 01:04:05,945
I really like you two,

705
01:04:07,537 --> 01:04:10,286
but the others have doubts.

706
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:13,659
They think you're narcs.

707
01:04:14,539 --> 01:04:15,746
It's that simple.

708
01:04:22,462 --> 01:04:23,586
Take him down.

709
01:04:34,702 --> 01:04:35,659
No!

710
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:38,329
Watch your step.

711
01:05:00,025 --> 01:05:01,274
And now?

712
01:05:04,065 --> 01:05:05,356
Now...

713
01:05:06,506 --> 01:05:07,630
Are we clear?

714
01:05:14,147 --> 01:05:16,438
I'll take you home.

715
01:05:38,789 --> 01:05:40,246
You had no choice.

716
01:05:41,151 --> 01:05:44,067
If I'd known it was him,
I'd have done the same.

717
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:46,991
I know.

718
01:05:51,272 --> 01:05:52,896
Now what?

719
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:57,032
We tell Gilbert and set up a sting.

720
01:05:58,472 --> 01:06:01,096
Where do we get the 60,000?

721
01:06:04,713 --> 01:06:05,920
Take it easy.

722
01:06:08,753 --> 01:06:09,877
I'm sorry.

723
01:06:25,956 --> 01:06:27,455
You work tomorrow?

724
01:06:27,716 --> 01:06:29,382
No, you?

725
01:06:29,517 --> 01:06:31,058
It's my last day.

726
01:06:37,317 --> 01:06:38,441
Well, I'm off.

727
01:06:39,877 --> 01:06:40,834
Sorry.

728
01:06:43,959 --> 01:06:45,208
See you later.

729
01:07:01,241 --> 01:07:03,740
Here she comes!
No kiss?

730
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:05,356
Hi!

731
01:07:06,761 --> 01:07:07,510
You're tired.

732
01:07:07,602 --> 01:07:09,226
Counterfeiters still here?

733
01:07:09,282 --> 01:07:11,614
Yes, still no confession.
Coffee?

734
01:07:11,681 --> 01:07:13,263
No, thanks. Later!

735
01:08:38,693 --> 01:08:40,817
Maybe Roland can sign right away.

736
01:08:40,932 --> 01:08:43,223
It would speed things up.

737
01:08:46,854 --> 01:08:49,311
Think I'm gonna sit here
all weekend?

738
01:10:01,464 --> 01:10:03,463
Jeez! Rough, huh?

739
01:10:03,544 --> 01:10:04,543
Damn right!

740
01:10:06,064 --> 01:10:07,313
Be right there.

741
01:10:23,185 --> 01:10:24,976
Five Irish, five German.

742
01:10:26,467 --> 01:10:28,716
I'm going to miss you.

743
01:10:28,827 --> 01:10:29,868
Me, too.

744
01:10:32,347 --> 01:10:33,804
Let's get together sometime.

745
01:10:33,906 --> 01:10:35,655
Why not? 10 Americans.

746
01:10:42,868 --> 01:10:44,284
Going OK, Roland?

747
01:10:44,708 --> 01:10:45,582
No.

748
01:10:54,509 --> 01:10:55,508
Sandrine?

749
01:10:56,430 --> 01:10:58,929
Would you get us some sandwiches?

750
01:10:59,590 --> 01:11:02,339
Everything's closed on Sundays!

751
01:11:58,958 --> 01:12:00,374
Coming, Captain?

752
01:12:00,518 --> 01:12:03,184
You don't see any smoke, do you?

753
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:04,657
I've got work to do!

754
01:12:35,243 --> 01:12:37,492
I'll call you right back!

755
01:13:56,134 --> 01:13:57,508
Need first aid?

756
01:13:57,653 --> 01:13:59,569
More like intensive care!

757
01:14:01,654 --> 01:14:02,903
What the hell!

758
01:14:03,934 --> 01:14:06,516
Another idiot playing with tear gas!

759
01:14:56,221 --> 01:14:58,137
The Captain wants to see you.

760
01:14:59,981 --> 01:15:01,188
What's it about?

761
01:15:02,141 --> 01:15:03,015
No idea.

762
01:15:07,662 --> 01:15:09,536
Be right there, Captain.

763
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:53,547
Here.

764
01:15:54,110 --> 01:15:56,109
- What is it?
- It's all there.

765
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:02,421
She just passed by.

766
01:16:04,629 --> 01:16:05,545
Be right back.

767
01:16:31,033 --> 01:16:33,199
There's plenty for the deal.

768
01:16:33,673 --> 01:16:34,839
Or to skip town.

769
01:16:35,514 --> 01:16:37,513
Otherwise they'll find us.

770
01:16:37,554 --> 01:16:38,761
Where'd we go?

771
01:16:40,433 --> 01:16:43,057
It's him.
When do we call the cops?

772
01:16:43,074 --> 01:16:44,948
Get the location first.

773
01:16:49,316 --> 01:16:50,440
How come?

774
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:53,439
No, it's up to you.

775
01:16:55,515 --> 01:16:56,431
See you then.

776
01:16:57,476 --> 01:16:58,475
Damn!

777
01:16:58,676 --> 01:17:01,050
He wants us at the club
without the cash.

778
01:17:01,557 --> 01:17:03,556
So they won't have the dope.

779
01:17:04,556 --> 01:17:05,680
What do we do?

780
01:17:05,877 --> 01:17:07,251
We go and see.

781
01:17:54,964 --> 01:17:55,963
Good evening.

782
01:17:56,123 --> 01:17:57,164
Evening.

783
01:17:58,443 --> 01:18:00,025
Want a drink?

784
01:18:00,124 --> 01:18:01,498
Vodka alright?

785
01:18:01,564 --> 01:18:02,563
Sure.

786
01:18:03,685 --> 01:18:05,601
- Get the money?
- Yes.

787
01:18:06,125 --> 01:18:07,832
The product's ready.

788
01:18:08,526 --> 01:18:10,150
So we're set.

789
01:18:11,526 --> 01:18:13,108
Marc's on his way.

790
01:18:13,325 --> 01:18:14,324
Okay.

791
01:18:21,086 --> 01:18:21,960
Marc!

792
01:18:23,247 --> 01:18:25,996
They're the ones who robbed Maxime!

793
01:18:29,649 --> 01:18:31,273
- You sure?
- Positive.

794
01:18:42,131 --> 01:18:45,255
Change of plans.
You and Joseph get the money,

795
01:18:45,330 --> 01:18:47,954
while Julie and I pick up the dope.

796
01:18:48,010 --> 01:18:49,634
No, we stay together.

797
01:18:50,491 --> 01:18:52,740
Do it or the deal's off!

798
01:18:53,171 --> 01:18:54,503
No, we're with you.

799
01:19:17,052 --> 01:19:18,801
Let's have a drink first.

800
01:20:02,541 --> 01:20:03,998
Gotcha.

801
01:20:05,139 --> 01:20:06,388
They're at the villa.

802
01:20:08,021 --> 01:20:10,437
Relax for God's sake!

803
01:20:10,702 --> 01:20:13,534
You're too valuable
a dealer to lose.

804
01:20:13,701 --> 01:20:14,575
Right.

805
01:20:34,184 --> 01:20:37,058
Pour yourselves a drink.
I'll get the money.

806
01:21:09,148 --> 01:21:10,772
Tell me where she is!

807
01:21:34,352 --> 01:21:36,351
You two have guts.

808
01:21:39,952 --> 01:21:41,618
Are you serious about him?

809
01:21:42,752 --> 01:21:43,501
Why?

810
01:21:45,272 --> 01:21:48,354
Dump him and work with me.

811
01:21:52,793 --> 01:21:55,792
Think fast, it's a one-time offer.

812
01:22:00,636 --> 01:22:01,593
No.

813
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:10,173
That's too bad.

814
01:22:13,236 --> 01:22:14,443
Really.

815
01:23:15,644 --> 01:23:17,018
Where are the goods?

816
01:23:19,124 --> 01:23:23,748
We wait until Joseph calls
and says he has the money.

817
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:30,587
Can I at least see it?

818
01:23:32,448 --> 01:23:33,322
No.

819
01:23:42,167 --> 01:23:43,541
Leave us, Nadine.

820
01:23:44,408 --> 01:23:46,657
Now, tell us everything, and fast!

821
01:23:46,729 --> 01:23:47,561
What?

822
01:23:47,688 --> 01:23:48,687
Enough!

823
01:23:51,249 --> 01:23:53,290
We know you ripped off Maxime!

824
01:23:53,409 --> 01:23:54,283
We know!

825
01:23:54,411 --> 01:23:55,660
Who?

826
01:23:59,330 --> 01:24:01,829
What about Patrick
at the garage, bitch?

827
01:24:01,930 --> 01:24:03,179
Never heard of him.

828
01:24:05,171 --> 01:24:07,170
- Really?
- No, never.

829
01:24:10,851 --> 01:24:12,225
You're a good liar.

830
01:24:13,331 --> 01:24:14,622
Isn't she?

831
01:24:17,293 --> 01:24:19,334
What's the difference anyway?

832
01:24:20,092 --> 01:24:22,549
Call Joseph,
we'll deal with her later.

833
01:24:26,094 --> 01:24:27,718
What if I said I was a cop?

834
01:24:28,853 --> 01:24:31,102
Shit, I knew it!

835
01:24:31,214 --> 01:24:32,255
Cunt!

836
01:24:35,774 --> 01:24:36,940
There's no answer.

837
01:24:37,975 --> 01:24:39,224
There's no answer!

838
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:41,878
We move the stash and the money.

839
01:24:42,015 --> 01:24:42,889
Fast!

840
01:24:43,015 --> 01:24:44,472
Fucking unbelievable!

841
01:24:45,775 --> 01:24:47,274
Take care of her.

842
01:28:42,206 --> 01:28:44,580
Get the money, I'll handle the lab.

843
01:28:46,727 --> 01:28:48,643
Leave through the garage.

844
01:29:31,172 --> 01:29:33,629
Freeze! Turn around!

845
01:29:34,053 --> 01:29:35,135
Turn around!

846
01:29:43,893 --> 01:29:45,392
Where are the others?

847
01:29:47,014 --> 01:29:48,013
In the lab.

848
01:30:22,658 --> 01:30:23,407
Drop it!

849
01:30:35,459 --> 01:30:37,500
If you fire, everything blows.

850
01:30:47,263 --> 01:30:48,262
Stop.

851
01:30:50,702 --> 01:30:51,701
Stop.

852
01:30:55,064 --> 01:30:56,021
Stop!

853
01:32:00,712 --> 01:32:02,086
Drop your weapon!

854
01:32:06,592 --> 01:32:07,799
Drop it!

855
01:32:46,437 --> 01:32:47,436
Simon?

856
01:32:50,157 --> 01:32:51,156
Simon!

857
01:33:32,643 --> 01:33:34,892
Why didn't you take those two in?

858
01:33:37,204 --> 01:33:38,828
Because they're our own.

859
01:33:41,284 --> 01:33:43,783
Now try firing them.
