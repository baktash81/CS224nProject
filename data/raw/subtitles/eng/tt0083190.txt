1
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,196
<i>There's a hot car from Charleston.
Running a name check on him now.</i>

2
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,754
<i>It's stolen or missing.</i>

3
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,556
<i>Ford four-door. Can you
make it to Melrose and Levin?</i>

4
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,514
<i>It's the north-side zone.</i>

5
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,597
<i>See if 32 has got him.</i>

6
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,271
Are you clear?

7
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,073
You're clear here.

8
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,433
Yeah. Come on.

9
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,589
Yo, Bruce. Wanna finish cleanin' up
that LTD? Move it up to the front line.

10
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,790
Get rid of this green Merc.

11
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,357
Hey, Bruce.
Park the Mark IV under the lights.

12
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,319
Hey, John! Spot this Cougar
on the corner for me, will ya?

13
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,833
Hey, sugar.
Those transfer titles come in?

14
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,270
No. Ralph got tied up on
the Chrysler with the cracked block.

15
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,833
Get Barry for me.

16
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,511
He had to drop some parts. You wanted
him to make the Laundromat collection.

17
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,756
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Barry? Hold on.

18
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,637
- You got him?
- Yeah. 232.

19
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,752
Yay. I don't know how long
I'm gonna be with the man,

00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,599

21
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,679

22
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,312
Bye.

23
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,996
Put your hand out.

24
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,230
Morning. Would you like some breakfast?

25
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,316
No. Just some coffee, thanks.

26
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,234
Thank you.

27
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,880

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,878
You got one and a half
to three-carat spread.

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,992
550,000 wholesale. I'll take 185,000.

31
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,389
- I'll take it myself.
- Fine.

32
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,399
Have someone swing around tomorrow
morning. These people wanna meet ya.

33
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,318
- What?
- They're stand-up guys.

34
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,510
To meet people I'll go to a country club.

35
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,236
OK, OK. By the way, you want me to put
some of your end out on the street?

36
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,477
Barry will collect it.
You down the bread to him at three.

37
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,989
You'll double your money in three months.

38
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,557
My money goes in the bank.
You put your money on the street.

39
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,793
- Hey, give me the check.
- Forget it.

40
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,994
Listen, we having dinner tonight?

41
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,792
Yeah.

42
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,356
- That's a new sweater. It's nice.
- Oh. Yeah, thanks.

43
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,795
- Then I'll pick you up at eight.
- Bye.

44
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:54,188
Tell him to see me the minute
he gets back here, and, uh...

45
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,952
Sure.

46
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,036
So take a shit under a hot rock.

47
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,913
Hey, Frank.
Frank, what's doin', boss man?

48
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,230
- Give me my wrench back, you hear?
- There's your tool.

49
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,911
- Can't work without a tool.
- I try my best. I see you can do it.

50
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,949
"Nothing new ever happens around here."

51
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,355
"...making life happen."

52
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,790
"Like you said...
collecting your debt back from society."

53
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,390
"I gotta see ya. Your pal, Okla."

54
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,116
"Gotta see ya."

55
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,314
Gimme a tall one, will ya?

56
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,118
- Barry's been callin' you.
- When?

57
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,073
I don't know.
Couple of times the last half-hour.

58
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,113
- Huh?
- Three times. 5329234.

59
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,435
- Gimme the phone, will ya?
- Yeah.

60
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,553
- Hello?
- Where are you?

61
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,114
- Where you been?
- You make the pick-up?

62
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,394
<i>I'm in a phone booth. Trying to find one
that works. I have not made the pick-up.</i>

63
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,035
We got a problem. Can you talk?

64
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,357
- No. Did you see our man?
- No. Cos there was no man.

65
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,552
<i>Gags took a walk through
a twelfth-storey window.</i>

66
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,913
<i>He's splattered all over the sidewalk.
What do you wanna do?</i>

67
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,352
Did he down our merch? Was he goin'?
Did he carry the cash on him? What?

68
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,029
I'm talking to somebody's somebody.
We'll know in 25 minutes.

69
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,869
You get the work car and
you meet me at Armitage and Lincoln.

70
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,956
Jimmy. Here, here.

71
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,996
<i>On the side Gags was laying down
juice loans on the street for this Attaglia.</i>

72
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,113
He's turning in the vig money,
but he's putting in his pocket the principle.

73
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:46,394
They found out he was screwing 'em over.
They went crazy. Ba-boom.

74
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,877
- Gags down our merch?
- At the RD Lounge. Paulie saw it go down.

75
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,232
It was your money that was in Gags'
pocket when he went out the window.

76
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,593
You keep this runnin'.

77
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,833
<i>- Can I help you?
- Yes, please. I'd like to see a Mr...</i>

78
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,474
<i>- I want a cup.
- Where's your cup?</i>

79
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,875
Back by the machine.
What were you saying?

80
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,833
Mr Attaglia? I'd like to see him.

81
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,758
You delivered some plating
and I had problems with it.

82
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,556
Just a minute. Mr Attaglia, there's
someone to see you about some plating.

83
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,432
OK.

84
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,876
- Back there.
- Thank you.

85
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,510
I'm Mr Attaglia.

86
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,599
You didn't get a delivery, or somethin'?
Sit down. Zinc? What?

87
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,036
My name is Frank. And that was bullshit.

88
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,108
- What is this?
- "This" is Joe Gags.

89
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,994
185,000 of my money.
We have this problem.

90
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,078
What problem?
What are you talking about?

91
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,275
He was moving my merchandise.

92
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,313
So the money in his pocket when
he went out the window is my money.

93
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,954
Why are you telling me this shit?

94
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,514
Shit? I want my money.

95
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,397
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Mr Frank La-la... Whatever.

96
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,717
- Did some guy die?
- Yes.

97
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,949
The estate goes to probate. Take it
to probate court. Why do you bug me?

98
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,109
I come here to discuss a piece of business
with you. You gonna tell me fairy tales?

99
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,313
Who the fuck are you, slick? Somebody
knows you? Are you crazy or what?

100
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,399
I don't know you. I don't know
some clown named Gags. Get outta here.

101
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,478
Carl! Go ahead, get the fuck outta here.

102
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,557
<i>- Hold it.
- All right. Jesus Christ!</i>

103
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,114
All right, do what he says.

104
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,029
- Do what he says.
- Lay down.

105
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,754
- Go ahead.
- Hands on your head. Spread your legs.

106
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,598
Now!

107
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,076
Hey, you, you goof! Look at the wall.

108
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:32,078
I am the last guy in the world
that you want to fuck with.

109
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,513
You found my money on Gags.

110
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,598
Let us pretend that you
don't know whose money it is.

111
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,998
That's right, for Christ's sakes.
I don't know who you are.

112
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,277
Three hours.

113
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,914
I will call to set a meet.

114
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,591
You will pay me my money, $185,000.

115
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,516
Sit down.

116
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,394
- Thanks for comin' on down so soon.
- I was comin' anyway.

117
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,512
- How's it going?
- Me?

118
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,029
I am doin' terrific.

119
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,196
Every day is a surprise.

120
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,519
It is real fuckin' weird out there.
It is nothing like we figured out.

121
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,312
- So what's to it, my man?
- Same old shit.

122
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,353
Morris finally busted Red's pruno
operation. A lot of knifings going on.

123
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,471
- Dope?
- Yeah. That and sex.

124
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,319
You wouldn't believe
the quality of people in here.

125
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,228
Ten or 15 years ago they'd have
dumped 'em in a funny farm somewhere.

126
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,717
Rapists, child molesters. They put that
shit in with the mainstream population.

127
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:28,039
Used to be, somebody like that, if they
lasted five days it'd be a record. Perverse.

128
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,233
- How's the wife?
- The wife?

129
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,396
There's nothing with the wife.

130
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,875
What happened?

131
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,958
I, uh... She doesn't know
I'm putting down scores.

132
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,310
And the rocket scientist that she is,

133
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,479
she figures out that
I am having affairs with fancy ladies.

134
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,191
Anyway, it gets all screwy and twisted.

135
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:58,110
- What are you gonna do?
- Well, I'm gonna put it back together.

136
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,398
Look, I met this new chick, this Jessie.

137
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,037
- You gonna marry her and have kids?
- Yes.

138
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,358
But she does not know what I do.

139
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,597
So what? Do I bullshit her along, or what?

140
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:20,316
Lie to no one. If they're somebody close
to you, you're gonna ruin it with a lie.

141
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,399
If they're a stranger, who the fuck
are they you gotta lie to them?

142
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,233
Hey, what do you need, man?

143
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,793
Get me outta here.

144
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,270
Ten months and you're on the street.

145
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,868
- You know Doc Shelton?
- Yeah.

146
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,515
That bastard's killed more guys
than the electric chair.

147
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,394
Well, I got angina somethin'
somethin' somethin'.

148
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,478
And I'm not gonna last ten months.

149
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,797
And I don't wanna die in here, Frank.
Not in here.

150
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,514
Well, you got it.

151
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,548
Gotta go, kid.

152
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,636
You got it.

153
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,633
He downed the merch to Gags,
is what he said.

154
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,038
I'm telling you, this cocksucker's trouble.
We whack him out.

155
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,396
Is this the prowler? The guy Gags had?

156
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,511
Has to be the one.

157
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,758
My name's Leo. How are ya?

158
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,235
How am I? I'm Frank.

159
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,277
Here's your money.

160
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,278
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

161
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,709
There's two inches of money out there.

162
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,353
<i>- Is it all there?
- I'm sure that it is.</i>

163
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,109
- Don't you say thanks or somethin'?
- Whose money is this?

164
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,199
It's your money. But I stopped
this guy from giving you a hard time.

165
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,438
<i>Thanks.</i>

166
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,120
<i>You're welcome. It's no big deal.</i>

167
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,356
I'll see ya.

168
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,278
- Where you goin'?
- Where am I going?

169
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,914
- I'm late.
- C'mon.

170
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,750
C'mon, I thought we'd talk a little
business, get to know each other.

171
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,829
No offence, you wanna get to meet
people, join a lonely hearts club.

172
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,270
I know you already.

173
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,356
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

174
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,477
- How you know me?
- That merch you put down to Gags.

175
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,158
Max Sherman.

176
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,035
Puerto Rican fence, Cotazar.
Where do you think they down it?

177
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,789
To me. I'm the bank.
I handle the fence for half this city.

178
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,357
You been puttin' down two, three scores
a month. Month in, month out.

179
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,871
I see your stuff. You got great taste.
Regular highline pro.

180
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,639
So I said to Gags "I wanna meet this guy."
He tell you that?

181
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,751
- Yes.
- Fine.

182
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,713
<i>- Let's cut the bullshit.
- Who is he?</i>

183
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,510
How the hell do I know?

184
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,553
You wanna put down contract scores
all over the country, working for me?

185
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:49,549
I am self-employed. I am doin' fine.
I don't deal with egos.

186
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,070
I am the boss of my own body,
so what do I have to work for you for?

187
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,829
Maybe you don't.
I'll lay it out, you can be the judge.

188
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,557
You don't look. You don't case. You don't
do nothin'. We point you to a score.

189
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,039
When we say it's there, it's there.
They're all laid-out scores.

190
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,071
How they worked up?

191
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,033
Alarm system diagrams,
blueprints, front-door key.

192
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,675
Sometimes the scores are in on it,
ripping off the insurance company.

193
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,315
- Work cars? Drops? Tools?
- Whatever you need, you'd see me.

194
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,992
I'd be your father. Money, guns, cars -
I'd be your father from here on.

195
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,396
- What's my end?
- You get a price. No negotiation.

196
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,308
We got expenses here you don't have.
But you'll know the price upfront.

197
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,032
- How big?
- Boxcar.

198
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,357
Nothin' under six figures.
I'll make you a millionaire.

199
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,994
I go to work for you,
I'm pullin' a lot of exposure.

200
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,429
- Our protection trades that off.
- Take a bust?

201
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,951
There's gonna be a lawyer, a bondsman
right there. You never spend a night in jail.

202
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,038
I steal ice. No furs, no coin collections,

203
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,631
no stock certificates, no Treasury bonds.
Just diamonds or cash.

204
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,875
Fine.

205
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,515
No cowboy shit, no home invasions.
I work with a partner.

206
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,598
We take care of you.
Your partner is your responsibility.

207
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,838
If he beefs on you, that's your problem.
If he beefs on us, that's your problem, too.

208
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,748
- Who are your inside people?
- That's my end. You don't have to know.

209
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,316
- So what do you say, Frank?
- I don't know.

210
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,954
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I don't know!

211
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:21,471
I don't believe in lifetime subscriptions.
Maybe it don't fit in with my retirement...

212
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,637
- What will you do retired?
- Pick corn with the chickens.

213
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:30,039
- Watch TV. What's the difference?
- All right, all right.

214
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,197
Two, three moves.
You wanna keep goin', that's fine.

215
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,232
But if you wanna split, that's fine, too.

216
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,557
Everybody's businesslike.
Everybody's an adult.

217
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,631
So let me know. Cos we'd be terrific.

218
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,710
Yeah, that's fine. I'll call ya.

219
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,071
<i># Sugar, sweet thing</i>

220
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,273

<i># In my life</i>

240
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,839
- Hurry. I'm parked on red.
- What are you doing here?

241
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,030
- Finding you.
- Get away from me, OK?

242
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:20,188
You are two hours late. I do not need this.
I do not need to be humiliated.

243
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,276
- Wait. I wanna talk to you.
- No.

244
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,231
<i>Hey, you!</i>

245
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,193
I will take you for coffee.
What's the big deal?

246
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,756
You take me anywhere?
That's a big laugh.

247
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,711
Maybe there is a reason.

248
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,799
- Hey, I'm talkin' to you.
- Take a walk, Flash. All right? Go on.

249
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,070
I don't know the reason. I don't wanna
hear it. There is no reason. That's all.

250
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,159
Look, you were lookin' forward to this.
All right? Come on.

251
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,916
Look, in what I do
there are sometimes pressures.

252
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,792
What the hell do you think that I do?

253
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,672
C'mon, c'mon.

254
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,110
C'mon! Every morning I walk in,
for five months, say hi.

255
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,073
What the hell do you think that I do?

256
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,193
You sell little fucking cars,
that's what you do.

257
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,551
I wear $150 slacks. I wear silk shirts.

258
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,752
I wear $800 suits. I wear a gold watch.

259
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,156
I wear a perfect, D,
flawless, three-carat ring.

260
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:04,319
I change cars like other guys
change their fucking shoes!

261
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,637
- I'm a thief. I've been in prison.
- So what? I don't care.

262
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,797
"So what?" I never even told my wife that.

263
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,354
- I don't care!
- Who is now gone.

264
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,436
- Did I ever come on to you?
- No.

265
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,074
- Well, you see?
- See? See what?

266
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,557
See? I am a straight arrow.
I am a true-blue kind of a guy.

267
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,240
I've been cool. I am now unmarried.

268
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,878
So let's cut the mini-moves and the
bullshit and get on with this big romance.

269
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,595
What? I don't believe it.

270
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,669
Do you think that I have been waiting
for you to come along? What is this shit?

271
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,350
You think I'm kidding, I can tell.
This is strictly on the up and up.

272
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,914
Jesus Christ!

273
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,316
- You are scared to death.
- You're an asshole.

274
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,069
That's lovely. What are you doing
in your life that is so terrific?

275
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,158
- My life is fine.
- Yeah, sure. Here.

276
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,993
- You don't know about me.
- Yeah? I know all about...

277
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,111
You know bullshit.

278
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,470
<i>Hey, hey.</i>

279
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,158
Why you gotta shout?

280
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,158
Excuse me.
Can we have two coffees here?

281
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,317
- Sorry. So?
- So. So what?

282
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,874
- So tell me.
- Menu?

283
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,672
No. Thanks.

284
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,519
So what was it like?

285
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,193
You know, a lot of money. Tucson.

286
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,677
Mexico City. Bogotá.
Drifting. You know... OK?

287
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,755
OK.

288
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,757
It got twisted and ugly.

289
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,396
And it was over already,
but we kept moving through the moves.

290
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,715
It ended very badly.

291
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,518
Now, I get up in the morning.
I take a shower.

292
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,713
I go to work. I have a job.
I have a Social Security card.

293
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,513
My life is very ordinary, very boring.

294
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,074
Which is good, because it's solid.

295
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,752
Marking time is what you are.
You are backing off. You are hiding out.

296
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,829
You're waiting for a bus you hope never
comes cos you don't wanna go anywhere.

297
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,997
Do you have a licence for this?

298
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,873
All right, how much was he moving?

299
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,111
Nothing till the end.

300
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,118
And then kilo amounts. I don't know.

301
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,196
And then what?

302
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,711
- He's dead.
- Hm?

303
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,671
He is dead.

304
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,031
That is good, because he's an asshole.

305
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,628
- There was love in the beginning.
- The guy was...

306
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,196
- There was love in the beginning.
- Big asshole.

307
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,437
He put you in a box. You know the things
they do to you if you do a bit in Colombia?

308
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,710
- Jesus Christ!
- Don't shout in here.

309
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,793
I was alone. I had no money,
no clothes, no visa,

310
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,515
standing on the corner
in Bogotá in Colombia...

311
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,313
Things did happen.

312
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:10,149
Where were you in prison?
Would you pass the cream, please?

313
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,236
Joliet.

314
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,959
Whoa. Ugh!

315
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,038
Hey, can we have some new cream here?

316
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:24,277
- What's wrong with it?
- What's wrong? It's cottage cheese.

317
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,918
The warden there was Joe Reagan.

318
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,996
Meatball Joe.

319
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,276
If that slob was a penologist
I'm a jet airplane pilot.

320
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,755
I did 11 years.

321
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,111
Got out, what, four years ago.

322
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,595
What'd you go up for?

323
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,551
I stole $40.

324
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,116
$40?

325
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,878
Yeah. It started with a two-year bit.
Parole in six months.

326
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,757
Right away, I got into this problem with
these two guys. They tried to turn me out.

327
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,317
So I picked up nine more
on a manslaughter beef.

328
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,635
Some other things.

329
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,718
I was 20 when I went in.
31 when I come out.

330
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:19,275
You don't count months and years.
You don't do time that way.

331
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,036
What do you mean? Why?

332
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,435
Why? You gotta forget time.

333
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,075
You gotta not give a fuck if you live or die.

334
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,829
You gotta get to where
nothin' means nothin'.

335
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,268
I'll tell you a story all about it.

336
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,551
Once there was this Captain Morphis.

337
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,116
This 300lb slob.
He couldn't write his name.

338
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,394
And he had this crew of
16 or 17 guards and cons.

339
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,954
Prison groups, you know? Crews.

340
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,396
They would go into these cells
and grab these young guys

341
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:58,559
and bring 'em up to Hydrotherapy
in the mental ward.

342
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,551
Gangbang.

343
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,798
If a guy puts up a struggle, they beat him
up. He winds up in the funny farm, and...

344
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,878
Anyway, the word comes down
that I am next.

345
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,394
And I do not know
what I am supposed to do.

346
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,512
I, uh... I am scared.

347
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,550
Eleven-thirty, twelve, the lights come on.

348
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,638
I got this pipe from plumbing.

349
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:30,393
And, uh, I whacked
the first guard in the shins.

350
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,318
I go through a convict
and another convict and...

351
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,274
Anyway, I get to Morphis,
and I whack him across the head twice.

352
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,757
Boom. And then they jump all over me,
do a bunch of things.

353
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:48,319
I spent six months in the hospital ward,
but... Morphis, he is also fucked up good.

354
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,316
Cerebral haematoma...

355
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,638
They pension him out - he can't walk
straight - and he dies two years later.

356
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,320
Which is a real loss to the planet Earth.

357
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,676
Meanwhile, I gotta go back
into the mainstream population.

358
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,633
And I know the minute
I hit the yard I am a dead man.

359
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,555
So I hit the yard.

360
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,035
So you know what happens?

361
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,754
Nothin'. I mean, nothin' happens.

362
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,429
Cos I don't mean nothin' to myself.
I don't care about me.

363
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,950
I don't care about... nothin'. You know?

364
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:30,039
Then I know from that day that I survive,

365
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,118
because I achieved that mental attitude.

366
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,956
Then, uh... see, later,

367
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,634
I... worked this out.

368
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,840
In the stone cell...

369
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,076
What is this?

370
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,156
That is my life.

371
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:07,912
And, uh... nothin', nobody
can stop me from makin' that happen.

372
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,791
Right there, that would be you.

373
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,312
Who's the old man here?

374
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,716
That is David Okla Bertinneau.

375
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,673
He's a master thief, a master,

376
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,756
and a great man.

377
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,034
He was like a father. He taught me
everything that I know about what I do.

378
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,550
And I told him about you.

379
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,956
Did you cut these out from magazines?

380
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,957
Yeah. Newspapers, whatever.

381
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,556
Why all of these dead people?

382
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,475
Inside, you are on ice from time.

383
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,512
You can't even die right, you know?
And here?

384
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:59,029
Here, people grow. They get old.
They die. Children come after.

385
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,155
Just a cycle, you know?

386
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,751
I don't know. I...

387
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,553
Yes, you do. You do.

388
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,399
You don't know from one day to the next

389
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,512
whether you're going to be killed,
go home, or get busted.

390
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,797
Look, I have run out of time.

391
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,275
I have lost it all.

392
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:29,350
So I can't work fast enough to catch up,
and I can't run fast enough to catch up.

393
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,439
And the only thing that catches me up
is doin' my magic act.

394
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,710
But it ends, you know? It will end.

395
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:41,710
When I got this, right there,
it ends, it's over.

396
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,799
So I'm just asking you... to be with me.

397
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,038
I can't...

398
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,515
I can't, uh...

399
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,435
I can't have children.

400
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,436
I don't fit into this.

401
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,596
What? So we adopt.

402
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,037
I'm not ready. See?

403
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,277
And I have my life.

404
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,391
So I can't.

405
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:23,719
What? I mean, what is going on
in your life that is so terrific?

406
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,832
Mine's been a mess.

407
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,432
I was just thinkin', you know,
that just maybe between the two of us,

408
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:37,190
that we could make somethin' happen,
somethin' special, somethin' really nice.

409
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,072
You know?

410
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,672
So I'm just...

411
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:46,237
I'm askin' you, uh... to, uh...

412
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,949
Look, and I got a way now that I can make
it happen faster. I mean, much faster.

413
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,872
And, uh...

414
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,995
I'm just askin' you. You know?

415
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,513
You're on.

416
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,599
They gotta be big scores.
They gotta be fast. One, two, tops.

417
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,032
Right.

418
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,436
<i>- That's it.
- Where?</i>

419
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,199
Third from the top, this side.

420
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,357
- Alarm systems?
- Five independent systems.

421
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:02,076
Four silent ringers into an alarm company
over the phone lines. Infrared pots.

422
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,034
Magnetics on the front door.
Sonic alarm. Vault door's bugged.

423
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,075
- What's this?
- Top floor. Top of the elevator shafts.

424
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,557
Floors eight through 14's alarm lines
conduit with the phones through the shaft.

425
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:20,231
What about taking the elevator to the top
floor, open the hatch, goin' in that way?

426
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:24,876
No. Elevators are locked and bugged
at night. I gotta take out two systems.

427
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,869
Chop through the roof, get the lines.
If we get the alarm, what is the box?

428
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,389
<i>- Richmond Lackett.
- Richmond Lackett?</i>

429
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,636
Yeah.

430
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,479
- Terrific. It's a burn job.
- No way to drill?

431
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,876
- Drill?
- Yeah.

432
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,556
Drill what?

433
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,514
They're custom-made. You bang
on this box all day, nothin' happens.

434
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,029
And I am pulling a lot of exposure.

435
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,674
16, 18 hours in there.

436
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:57,318
Your end covers the risk. 830,000. Four
million at wholesale in unmounted stones.

437
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,637
- What's the fifth alarm?
- We can not run it down.

438
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,558
- Why?
- It does not go out over the phone lines.

439
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,958
We swept the lines in the whole building.
But we know it is there.

440
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,910
- How long?
- Four, eight weeks.

441
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,794
Assuming we get the alarm
and what to cut the box with.

442
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:32,159
I need a couple of Cal licences,
and bring the work cars here.

443
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,635
OK. I'll set it up. What time's our plane?

444
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:39,470
<i>- We're on the 2.30.
- Stay here. Make that fifth alarm.</i>

445
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:48,799
Do you like it? I mean,
do you think it'll do? It's OK?

446
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,708
Frank, I love it. I love it. I think it's terrific.

447
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,798
What are you looking at?

448
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,076
You, that's all.

449
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,512
Sam.

450
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,513
- How you doin'?
- I'm golden, scoring like a champ.

451
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,596
I need a favour.

452
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,677
How's Okla?

453
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,588
Angina. I'm makin' some moves
to get him out of there.

454
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,349
I got a hearing fixed up.
Who's the yo-yo in the white coat?

455
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,675
Metallurgist. Son-in-law's idea.

456
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,271
A load of tubing comes in,
I taste it. I smell it.

457
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,039
I chew it. I spit on it.

458
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,355
Hey, scientist cocksucker!

459
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,836
18 per cent zinc. 14 per cent copper.

460
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,191
38 per cent tin.
The one per cent, I don't know.

461
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,630
A white coat.
Around here, he wears a white coat.

462
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,718
What's he gonna discover? Penicillin?

463
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:41,799
You gotta be a real putz
to wear a white coat around here.

464
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,996
Huey, excuse us.

465
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,109
- What kinda steel?
- Swedish cold-rolled, 247.

466
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,074
Here, here, here and here -
one-inch plates.

467
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,916
Copper to bind drills. Titanium alloy here.

468
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,754
This is a well-made,
very expensive, very special vault.

469
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,958
English? Richmond and Lackett?

470
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,548
I need a very special piece of equipment.

471
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,553
- Drill a hole in the lock box...
- Each one is different.

472
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:36,708
There's no way of telling where the lock
box is. I wanna cut a new door, walk in.

473
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,790
Seven, eight thousand degrees?

474
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,992
Portable equipment?
There's no other way to do it?

475
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,189
No.

476
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:50,350
Sonny, if I can build something,
it's gonna be a son of a bitch to use.

477
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,278
OK. So is it worth it?

478
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,709
It is worth it.

479
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,798
- You sweep the phone?
- Weekly. It's clean.

480
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,670
Hello? I'm Frank.

481
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,759
Yeah. Leo said to call about California
licences and registrations.

482
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,313
Yeah.

483
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,194
I'll be in Division 126 in an hour.
I'm wearing a grey leather coat.

484
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,072
Good.

485
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,468
So what's to it, Sam?

486
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,273
I gotta build a section of vault to tell.

487
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,951
I don't know if it's even possible
to build a tool that'll cut it like that.

488
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,355
See me in a week.

489
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,269
This petition is that David Okla Bertinneau

490
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,790
pleads for Your Honour to modify
his 1958 conviction,

491
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,115
and to issue a writ of habeas corpus.

492
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:07,794
But he violated Chapter 38,
Section 19-1, burglary.

493
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,151
Chapter 38, Section 16-1, theft.

494
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,158
Here's two California licences
I fixed in Sacramento.

495
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,352
...and dignity of the state.

496
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,592
That distresses me. This man is
of reformed character, advanced age,

497
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:32,316
and suffers from a heart condition and
may not be able to serve out his sentence.

498
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:38,037
He's spent over 21 years in incarceration
and has become a different person.

499
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,956
I don't know.

500
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,908
I remain unconvinced.

501
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:50,477
- Are they pickin' their noses up there?
- Wait a minute. I wanna hear this.

502
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:58,553
However, upon consideration,
I will issue a writ of habeas corpus.

503
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,878
Thank you, Your Honour. I'll write up
the order. I know how busy you are.

504
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,478
My wife's in the market for a fur coat.

505
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:14,557
- I am a car salesman.
- Sure. Whatever you say.

506
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,636
That's right.

507
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:26,112
Okla will be on the street in a week.
I need 6,000 for Earl Warren.

508
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,118
A week, yeah? Here, 10,000.

509
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,959
You're a prince. Buy yourself a new suit.

510
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,513
- A week?
- A week.

511
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:34,914
All right!

512
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,759
Who lives here? C'mon, who lives here?

513
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,350
- Hi.
- It's gotta be some millionaire guy, huh?

514
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,870
Hey, look at this. Tree. Bush.

515
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,751
- Pink tree.
- Hello!

516
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,632
Pink?

517
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,796
- Hey. It's real nice.
- Sure. Come back.

518
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,831
- Hi, Frank.
- How you doin', Marie?

519
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,757
This is beautiful, man.

520
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,235
When'd you get back?

521
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,794
Last night, late.

522
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,354
You make that fifth alarm?

523
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,114
I made the fifth alarm.

524
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,792
Good.

525
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,989
- So what's to it?
- OK.

526
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:42,079
Alarm system number five
is a one-channel radio transmitter.

527
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,869
- How's it triggered?
- There's a sonic detector off the ceiling.

528
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,993
Now, they set off the alarm every morning
when they walk in. It's tripped.

529
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:54,749
They have ten seconds to transmit
a code word to the alarm company.

530
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,872
Now, the code word goes over the radio.

531
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,231
That's why there's no phone lines.

532
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,351
All right, I tell you what.

533
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,391
- You bug it.
- All right.

534
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,877
Call Joseph, have him fix you one. You go
back there and you bug 'em for the word.

535
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,993
C'mon. It's gettin' cold. Oh.

536
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:18,557
This LA move, you know?
It's home free for me, after it's done.

537
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,476
You happy?

538
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,352
C'mon.

539
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,432
Hey, want something to eat?

540
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,198
Well...

541
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,475
I see on your application here...

542
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:50,878
By the way, you misspelled "male".
It's M-A-L-E.

543
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,309
The other is what we put in postboxes.

544
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:59,072
I see you put under "employer":
"1959 to 1976, Joliet State Penitentiary".

545
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,713
Yes.

546
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,274
You worked for the state, I take it?

547
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,392
- After a fashion.
- What did you do at the prison?

548
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,670
<i>Desks.</i>

549
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,759
I spot-welded desks,
and then I got promoted to shoes.

550
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,155
You were in charge of the shop?

551
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,589
Lady, I was a convict. I was doing time.

552
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:20,188
- You were what?
- Frank, let's go.

553
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:25,914
Uh, you have to understand,
we have more applicants than children.

554
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,871
Then why do you still have kids here?

555
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,198
As a kid, I would not be falling all over
myself to stay in one of these places.

556
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,675
We will relieve you of some of the burden.

557
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,793
The point is, we establish
criteria for parenting.

558
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,480
An ex-convict compared
to other desirables...

559
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,830
So we'll take a kid that's not so desirable.

560
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:47,111
You got a black kid? We'll take
a black kid. You got a Chink kid?

561
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,390
- You don't...
- No one likes older kids.

562
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,830
You got an eight-year-old black Chink kid?
We'll take him.

563
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,396
- Frank?
- Wait. If it's a matter of... You know? Here.

564
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,158
- What is that?
- What is that?

565
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:01,829
That is D, flawless,
3.2 carats, emerald cut.

566
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,633
- This is not a marketplace.
- Right.

567
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:09,197
You're not smart enough to take this
any more than to identify good parents.

568
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,276
Get out of my office.

569
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,233
You did not ask about us
or what kind of people we are.

570
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:18,831
There is a child waiting. You are denying
us him and him us. Who the hell are you?

571
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,190
- Don't make a scene.
- Our criteria...

572
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,038
Your criteria?

573
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:26,948
Your criteria are so far up your ass
they can't see daylight. Bullshit!

574
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,389
It's not happening. Let's go.

575
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,557
I got some ABC-type
information for you, lady.

576
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:36,309
I was state raised,
and this is a dead place.

577
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,075
A child in eight-by-four green walls.

578
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,760
After a while you tell
the walls "My life is yours."

579
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,269
- You grow up in the suburbs?
- Yes.

580
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,356
Right. Right.

581
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,034
What are you lookin' at? Huh?

582
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,837
<i>- Jimmy's got better.
- Yeah. Cos he charcoals 'em.</i>

583
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,231
- I'm gonna pull him over here.
- Yeah.

584
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,509
Hey, how you doin'?

585
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,949
- Wonderful, thank you.
- That's good.

586
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:35,312
You know, a very important thing for
you to remember is gonna be my name.

587
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,557
- Sergeant Urizzi.
- Urizzi. Why's that?

588
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,918
Because I'm gonna do good things for ya.

589
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,996
What for? Good conduct medal?

590
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,078
Nah. I'm here to make life easy for you.

591
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,272
Yeah? Smooth out
the bumps and the humps.

592
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,870
You know? Your relationship with us.

593
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,355
I didn't know I had one.

594
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,916
Look, we're your new partners.
We're in for ten points.

595
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,118
What'd this set you back?

596
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,071
Ten points of what?

597
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,678
You know. The guy?

598
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,598
Leo. Your action.

599
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:19,434
I don't get this. What's with you? Listen.

600
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,796
Our end goes with the territory.

601
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,553
Don't you know you gotta come up?

602
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,636
I am a car salesman.

603
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,399
You guys want a deal
on a Buick, come on.

604
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:36,149
- Hey, motherfucker...
- Don't you come on to me. And you?

605
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:39,397
You wanna pinch me, you pinch me.
I'll be out in ten minutes.

606
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,751
If not, get the fuck off my car.

607
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:39,475
- You all right?
- What does this mean?

608
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:44,195
It means... heat, police.

609
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:47,718
It means it's hard for me
to make moves from now on.

610
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:51,114
Beepers on the cars, the works.

611
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:55,669
Are they in the walls? Can they hear
everything we're saying all the time?

612
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,792
Probably it's just the phones,
but I'll check.

613
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,876
You're uneasy.

614
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,993
- Fuck this house. We move.
- I'm OK.

615
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,676
I'm OK.

616
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,071
Bastards.

617
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:31,189
<i>Hey, José Greco. Sit down.</i>

618
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,596
<i>I got this business deal.</i>

619
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,190
From your end of the LA score,
want me to put some of it to work for you?

620
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,756
- Street juice?
- You couldn't get me out of bed for that.

621
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,269
I'm not cutting up nickels here.

622
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:51,952
Shopping centres. Fort Worth,
Davenport, Jacksonville. Strictly legit.

623
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,548
- My money goes in my pocket.
- Yours if you want in.

624
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:59,754
Gonna give you everything you need. You
don't have to tell me now. Tell me later.

625
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:04,032
I wanna know why the minute I get locked
with you everybody knows my business.

626
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:08,756
My house is bugged. My wife is upset.
The guy at the Vehicle Bureau wants a fur.

627
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,271
There's a cop tail right now a half a block
down the street. My car is bugged. Here.

628
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,994
This one behind the bumper,
I'm supposed to find.

629
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:19,476
The other one in the wheel well's
supposed to fool me. What is this?

630
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,750
- Leave it to me.
- Leave what to you? Do it!

631
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:26,078
I said I'll take care of it.
What about burning the vault?

632
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,952
- What about it?
- Can you do it?

633
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,036
- I don't know.
- OK.

634
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,993
- Fifth alarm system?
- Nothing yet.

635
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,997
OK.

636
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:42,875
- What else you got on your mind?
- What are you talking about?

637
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,356
You got family troubles?
Somethin' with the old lady?

638
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:51,429
- What is this? Dear fuckin' Abby?
- You tryin' to adopt a kid?

639
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,992
- How do you know that?
- Barry mentioned to Mitch, Mitch to me.

640
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:05,078
You got friends.
Lighten up, for Christ's sake.

641
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:10,110
Why don't you come to me with
your problems? What am I? A stranger?

642
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:13,232
I take care of my people.
Anything you want.

643
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,432
You and me, we do business.
I do not mix apples and oranges.

644
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:17,709
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit?

645
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,831
Yeah.

646
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:24,317
With my wife, with my kids,
that's my whole life.

647
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:28,358
We are very tight.
Kids are special, a miracle.

648
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,396
A little hoochie-coo, drop of energy -

649
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,479
wham-bam-magic-Sam,
there's something sacred there.

650
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,756
That's my attitude.

651
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,757
What happens?

652
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:56,112
You state your model.
Black, brown, yellow or white.

653
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,753
Boy or girl.

654
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,236
Where from?

655
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:06,590
Couple of ladies. They got babies - to sell.

656
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,995
- Their own. They sell 'em.
- Jesus!

657
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:12,829
It's not the kid's fault
that his mother's an asshole.

658
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:17,397
And you're not buying the mother.
You're not gonna get a kid on the straight.

659
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,475
I want a boy.

660
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,079
- Done.
- Hm?

661
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,918
Done. You got a boy.

662
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,270
Yeah? I got a boy?

663
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,391
Yeah. What else you want?

664
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,837
- You son of a bitch!
- Hey, Mitch, get the... Yeah!

665
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,196
Hey, Jess.

666
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,111
Hey, pal.

667
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:58,709
What are you doin'?
You playin' sick in here?

668
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:03,197
I got three chicks waiting for you on
the street. You're gonna get me in trouble.

669
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,112
Goof.

670
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:12,597
Oh, this is my wife Jessie.

671
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:17,992
Frank.

672
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,110
- Code blue. You'll have to leave.
- No.

673
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:34,198
<i>- You'll have to leave.
- Frank, come on.</i>

674
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:43,237
After the hearing, Judge Ramsey's court
writ mittimus papers.

675
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:46,158
The board had to release him to me.

676
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:49,477
On the stairs outside, he just dropped.

677
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:53,317
<i>What did he whisper to you?</i>

678
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,829
Oh, he said thanks.

679
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:59,032
You know, for getting him out.

680
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:03,915
I mean, that's the big thing, you know.
Not to die in that joint. Not to die in there.

681
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,913
It's a big thing.

682
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,595
- Who's Mr Bertineau's family?
- I am.

683
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:14,393
Look, I'm sorry, he didn't make it.

684
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:18,118
If there's anything I can do, uh...

685
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,557
Are you OK?

686
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,636
I'm sorry.

687
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,070
Do you wanna sit down?

688
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:23,996
Refill?

689
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:31,948
That's a nice baby.
You're lucky you've got such a nice baby.

690
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:35,629
- Thank you. Can you warm this up?
- No problem.

691
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,513
- What his name?
- No name, not yet.

692
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:47,754
So here we are.

693
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,316
Are you OK?

694
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:58,313
Long, long, long, long time.

695
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:04,318
You see that?
Okla dies and our baby is born.

696
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:08,278
Do you wanna name him after Okla?

697
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,315
Okla's real name was David.

698
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,316
David.

699
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,312
David.

700
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:23,669
<i>David?</i>

701
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,313
David.

702
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:28,312
Hey!

703
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:36,072
Our kid, his name's David.

704
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,794
David. David good name.

705
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,716
Hey, David.

706
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,116
What's to it?

707
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:59,598
<i>Light this, then get out of the way.</i>

708
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,193
Not bad.

709
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:32,276
I'll see you, kid.

710
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:47,755
Betsy thought it was serious
but I don't think so.

711
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:16,229
He gave Ruth a shot. 24 hours,
it was gone. Must have been a flu bug.

712
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:23,233
Mexico. We're in. Thanks.

713
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:57,437
Have Julio wax the floor, will ya?

714
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:06,549
- Yeah. Green Mill.
- Is Frank there?

715
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,875
Wait a minute. Frank?

716
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,309
Oscar, get Frank.

717
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,396
Hey, come back.

718
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,992
Telephone.

719
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,393
Yeah?

720
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:24,158
<i>- Is that you?
- Yeah. Hold on.</i>

721
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:26,316
Do me a favour.

722
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:29,196
<i>- Yeah. Go ahead.
- We are on.</i>

723
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:31,951
<i>You understand?</i>

724
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,435
Yes. I understand.

725
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,031
C'mon. C'mon.

726
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:14,594
Gimme an excuse. C'mon!

727
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,116
Get outta that car.

728
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,392
- You're pinched.
- For what?

729
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,750
Driving without a taillight.

730
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,112
Argh!

731
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,192
Ugh!

732
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:00,432
Urgh!

733
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:11,035
Pick him up, huh?

734
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:24,791
Hey, car salesman. Urizzi.
You remember my name now?

735
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,399
How can I not?

736
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:31,878
Since the police department
does not hire too many Puerto Ricans.

737
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,309
Hey, asshole, I'm Italian!

738
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,634
I'm pleased to meet you,
ugly wop son of a bitch.

739
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,716
You motherfucker!

740
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:44,389
You're a stand-up guy.
You're a real stand-up guy.

741
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:48,035
You got a mouth. You can take a trimmin'.

742
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:50,355
You could make things
easy for everybody.

743
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:55,235
But no, you gotta be a goof.
You're real good.

744
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:58,998
No violence, strictly professional.

745
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:01,636
I'd probably like you.

746
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:06,709
Like to go the track, ball games,
stuff like that. You know?

747
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:13,150
Frank, there's ways of doin' things
that round off the corners,

748
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,475
make life easy for everybody.

749
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:19,636
What's wrong with that?
There's plenty to go around.

750
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,279
We know what you take down.

751
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:26,597
We know you got somethin' major
comin' down, soon.

752
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:31,039
But no, you gotta
come on like a stiff prick.

753
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:33,674
Who the fuck do you think you are?

754
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,631
What's the matter with you?

755
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:39,548
You got somethin' to say?
You waitin' for me to ask you to dance?

756
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:45,789
Did it ever occur to you... to try to work
for a livin', take down your own scores?

757
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,956
- Fuck this guy.
- I tell you something.

758
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:51,277
I'm gonna be on your ass so much
you're gonna get careless.

759
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,995
<i>And on that day
I'm gonna be in that place.</i>

760
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:59,830
And that is the last place
that you wanna be,

761
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:01,632
cos no matter what happens,

762
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:07,357
I will never, ever take a pinch
from a greasy motherfucker like you.

763
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,311
Fuck you, you fucker!

764
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:13,000
- I'll kill you!
- Dancin' goes two ways, prick!

765
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:15,554
Get this asshole outta here!

766
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,956
Cut him loose.

767
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:27,755
<i>- John?
- Yeah?</i>

768
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:32,438
- You got eyes? You got him?
- Yeah. He's beepin' in good.

769
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,718
OK.

770
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,755
Pull over. He'll spot us. He's stoppin'.

771
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:17,075
John, what's he doin'?

772
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:20,556
<i>Just relax and stay put.</i>

773
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,435
Hit it! Hit it! He's movin'.

774
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,836
Hit it.

775
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:20,397
OK. Relax and fall back. We got him.

776
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:23,355
We're right with ya.

777
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,520
- What's he gonna put down?
- I don't know.

778
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:32,077
But we're gonna be right on this guy's ass.
This guy's gonna be history.

779
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:36,116
Gimme some coffee.

780
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:25,597
- OK.
- Here.

781
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:37,515
40 volts. You got a phone line.

782
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,836
Phone.

783
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:54,315
Hold it. You got one.

784
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,716
Hook it up.

785
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,193
Go.

786
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:18,435
Phone.

787
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:27,112
Yeah.

788
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,829
C'mon. One more and we open her up.

789
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,192
Mexico.

790
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,156
All right, I'm inside.

791
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,668
Any surges on the line?

792
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:51,316
They held.

793
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:54,035
Come on. We own it.

794
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:54,271
- Lit?
- No.

795
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:58,432
OK.

796
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:35,992
Hey.

797
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:39,030
You should come in. Water's great.

798
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:43,870
Yeah. Enjoy it now. We're goin' home.
Tomorrow we collect. Just talked to Leo.

799
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,116
That's great.

800
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:48,595
Hey, Marie!

801
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,594
Marie, come here.

802
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:08,835
I'll go get the bags.

803
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:11,756
- Come in, Frank. Sit down.
- Thank you.

804
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:14,235
How you doin'? You look great.

805
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:15,793
Couldn't be better.

806
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:18,639
I know this is what you're here for, kid.

807
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:21,513
That's it. Mitch, what's to it?

808
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:24,598
Your tan is great.
How long were you in San Diego?

809
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:28,239
- A few days.
- Mitch told me all about the score.

810
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:31,318
Said that you were Dr Wizard.

811
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:34,238
<i>Yeah?</i>

812
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:36,635
Hello, Frank.

813
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:43,517
- Where's the rest?
- Don't worry about it.

814
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:48,478
- What is this?
- This is the cash part.

815
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:53,632
Well, you're light.

816
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:57,958
830,000's supposed be here,
and I count, what, 70, 80, 90.

817
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:02,710
Cos I put you into the Jacksonville, Fort
Worth and Davenport shopping centres.

818
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:06,594
I take care of my people. You can ask
these guys. Papers are at your house.

819
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:10,633
It's a limited partnership
with a subchapter S corporation.

820
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:13,479
You've got equity with me in that.

821
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,754
- Well, count me out.
- I thought we had this good thing.

822
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:23,798
Plus we got a major score
in Palm Beach for you in six weeks.

823
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:29,600
Talkin' to me,
or somebody else walk in this room?

824
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:36,475
What's that supposed to mean?

825
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:41,592
It means you are dreaming.
This is payday. It is over.

826
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:49,397
You know, when you have
trouble with the cops,

827
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:54,310
you pay 'em off like everybody else
because that's the way things are done.

828
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:56,317
- But not you, huh?
- No.

829
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:59,159
They don't run me and you don't run me.

830
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,436
I give you houses.
I give you a car. You're family.

831
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:08,477
I thought you'd come around.
What the hell is this? Where is gratitude?

832
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:12,912
- Where is my end?
- You can't see day for night.

833
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:19,354
I can see my money is still in your pocket,
which is from the yield of my labour.

834
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:25,352
What gratitude?

835
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:29,712
You're making big profits
from my work, my risk, my sweat.

836
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:33,674
But that is OK, because
I elected it to make that deal.

837
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:36,519
But now the deal is over.

838
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:39,393
I want my end, and I am out.

839
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:45,990
Why don't you join a labour union?

840
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:51,753
- I am wearing it.
- Frank, don't.

841
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:54,950
Do it, slick.

842
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:59,153
My money in 24 hours,
or you will wear your ass for a hat.

843
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:01,236
Get the hell out.

844
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:05,154
I tell ya? What did I tell ya?

845
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:43,190
Where is he?

846
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:26,552
Barry?

847
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:31,114
Talk to him.

848
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:33,276
Answer him.

849
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:39,268
Answer him. Answer him!

850
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:08,598
He's talkin' to you.
Answer him. Answer him.

851
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:10,392
Frank!

852
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:14,750
<i>You're set up!</i>

853
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:46,474
Look.

854
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:51,953
I said fuckin' look at him.

855
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:57,029
Look what happened to your friend cos
you go against the way things go down.

856
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:03,038
You treat what I tried
to do for you like shit.

857
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:07,714
You don't wanna work for me?
What's wrong with you?

858
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:11,598
And then you carry a piece in my house.

859
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:17,030
You one of those burned-out,
demolished wackos in the joint?

860
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:20,232
You're scary because
you don't give a fuck.

861
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:24,433
But don't come on to me now with your
jailhouse bullshit. You are not that guy.

862
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:27,438
Don't you get it, you prick?

863
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:31,519
You got a home, car, businesses, family.

864
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:35,599
And I own the paper
on your whole fuckin' life.

865
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:41,949
I'll put your cunt wife on the street to be
fucked by niggers and Puerto Ricans.

866
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:46,755
Your kid's mine because I bought it.

867
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:50,316
You got him on loan.
He is leased. You are renting him.

868
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:55,237
I'll whack out your whole family.

869
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:59,911
People'll be eating 'em for lunch tomorrow
in their hamburgers and not know it.

870
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:02,679
You get paid what I say.

871
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:06,679
You do what I say. I run you.
There is no discussion.

872
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:11,749
I want your work until you are burned out,
you are busted or you're dead.

873
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:15,674
Do you get it?

874
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:18,155
You got responsibilities.

875
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:23,191
Tighten up and do it.

876
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:26,351
Clean this mess up.

877
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:30,109
Get him outta here. Back to work, Frank.

878
01:39:56,920 --> 01:40:01,357
Joseph, get over here right away.
You're goin' on a trip.

879
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:06,832
Frank?

880
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:09,872
What?

881
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:12,433
Wake up the kid.

882
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:16,111
Hm?

883
01:40:17,320 --> 01:40:19,629
You are going away.

884
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:24,639
It's not what was supposed to be.

885
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:27,558
It can't be this way.

886
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:29,955
Don't you understand?

887
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:33,276
Mm-mm.

888
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:44,517
Do not take anything.
Do not pack. Do it now.

889
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:49,516
<i>- Where are we going?
- We are not going.</i>

890
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:53,672
- You are going.
- Where? What's wrong with you?

891
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:56,155
I don't understand.
When are you gonna come?

892
01:40:56,280 --> 01:40:58,236
I am not.

893
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:06,116
You will work out with Joseph where
you are going to go. Here is $410,000.

894
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:13,996
Wait. We just disassemble it
and put it back in a box?

895
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:18,989
Like an Erector Set that
you just send back to a store?

896
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,434
I love you. I'm not going anywhere.

897
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:27,355
You give Joseph 20,000
for month number one.

898
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:29,436
What are you doing?

899
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:35,631
- You give him 25,000 for month two.
- Doesn't anything mean anything?

900
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:41,076
- I'm your woman, you're my man.
- 30,000 for the third.

901
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:52,910
Frank, Frank. I made a commitment.

902
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:55,395
To hell with me,

903
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:58,353
with you, with everything.

904
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:04,435
I'm throwing you out.

905
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:12,952
Get out.

906
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:22,352
Get out.

907
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:32,836
Get out!

908
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:03,476
You want some milk?

909
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:05,556
No. I'm OK.

910
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:35,312
Argh!

911
