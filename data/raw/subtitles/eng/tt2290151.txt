1
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:04,665
" Rock hard ."

2
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,706
" Let's have a party! "

3
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:10,334
" Rock hard, real gone stuff. "

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,369
" Can't get enough, rock hard. "

5
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,509
Thank you very much, ladies.

6
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:19,779
Ladies.

7
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:24,783
- Now what?
- Well, you want to talk about...

8
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:25,950
All right.

9
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,358
- ...like Big Star, things like that?
- Okay.

10
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:31,022
Well, what's the story
behind the 'third" album?

11
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:33,622
There was a lot of turmoil involved
in recording that album, wasn't there?

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,032
I mean, you went into the studio

13
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:37,797
and is that what caused the breakup,

14
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,071
was recording the third album?

15
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:43,303
Shit, no.
No, it was just, um... you know,

16
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,071
we broke up after the first album.

17
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:47,238
Really.

18
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:48,780
After the first?

19
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:50,713
Yeah, has anybody here
ever heard Big Star?

20
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,217
- We should play Big Star for them...
- Yes.

21
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,651
...before we talk about Big Star
is the thing, you know.

22
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,451
I mean, we're already playing
Alex Chilton's solo records.

23
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,219
They're very wonderful.

24
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:01,726
However, now we're gonna
talk about a band

25
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:04,320
I used to play with that, um,

26
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:07,230
"changed a lot of peoples" heads.

27
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,213
Rock Writers of the World,
a lot of it's a blur.

28
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,753
We had meetings.

29
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,017
I think we elected like a president.

30
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,955
The whole premise was to unionize,

31
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,621
but the real reason for this

32
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:40,131
is they wanted us to see Big Star.

33
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,131
I can't even say that I remember

34
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:48,368
everything about their set
except that, you know,

35
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,706
they had a bunch of rock critics dancing
which is beyond a miracle.

36
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:54,645
They were...
they were just unbelievably great.

37
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,882
I remember Cameron Crowe saying
that something had really happened,

38
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,445
something had really
been transformed in him.

39
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:07,015
He didn't think it would be this good.
None of us did.

40
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:09,152
It was one of those seminal moments.

41
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:11,989
" O My Soul... "

42
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,726
Rock 103, WZXR, Memphis.

43
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,358
Morning to you, this is Redbeard.

44
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:18,734
Some of you probably weren't really
too much into Rock and Roll

45
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,706
when Big Star was here
in Memphis in "72, "73,

46
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:24,937
but they have reached a cult status.

47
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,679
" You know it's all right. "

48
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:32,584
" We've got all night... "

49
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,745
it seemed unusual
that you could hear an album

50
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,984
that was so incredibly good

51
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:41,526
and people didn't really know the music.
It was amazing.

52
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:48,064
This is Fresh Air.
My guest is Alex Chilton.

53
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:50,694
He started his career
as the lead singer of the Box Tops

54
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,034
and he formed his own band Big Star.

55
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,334
Many singer-songwriters
have been inspired...

56
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,205
And after Chris Bell split
the band, Chris went over to England

57
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,711
and while he was there recorded
a considerable amount of material

58
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,076
at Air London Studios with...

59
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:02,774
it's a strange history.

60
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,249
You have to do a lot of explaining
of who this band is.

61
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,718
All of these people
in that Memphis community...

62
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:11,382
it feels like an odd connection
and collection of people.

63
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:16,694
Those couple
of records are such masterpieces.

64
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,355
They're so pristine.

65
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,956
And if you only knew that side,

66
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,865
you wouldn't know the whole history.

67
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,733
All the problems with distribution

68
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,533
and the record not getting out there.

69
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:30,201
They really were
kind of on their own island.

70
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:33,507
It's that isolation that creates
the uniqueness, you know?

71
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,484
To me, Big Star was like some letter

72
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,248
that was posted in 1971

73
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,985
that arrived in 1985.

74
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,688
You know, it's just like something
that got lost in the mail, really.

75
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,931
It felt more personal to me.

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,491
It felt like it was your own.
It was pretty hard to say

77
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,129
you could feel like
Fleetwood Mac was your own.

78
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:02,003
Whatever... however...
whatever quality it was,

79
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,770
it belonged to the world.

80
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,175
There's a sadness to it

81
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,578
because those were
some of the best records made

82
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:11,674
in that decade
and they just didn't get heard.

83
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,978
Sometimes lack of success

84
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:19,024
forces you deeper within yourself,

85
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,220
and that to me is the best thing
about the Big Star story.

86
00:04:23,745 --> 00:04:30,645
Sync and corrections by R3V0LV3R.

87
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,058
Well, I guess the best way to set up

88
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,188
the Big Star story is

89
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,892
the "60s in Memphis
and what was going on."

90
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:05,028
There's, of course,
the impact of the British invasion.

91
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:08,835
What had been just
a handful of garage bands...

92
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,240
all of a sudden
there were bands everywhere.

93
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,646
I wasn't
particularly aware that Memphis was

94
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:21,710
one of the places where
Rock and Roll got invented.

95
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,256
They would have contests
on the radio all the time...

96
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,758
well, you know, "Who's the best,
the Beatles or Elvis?"

97
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:30,057
I pestered my parents
till they bought me a bass

98
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,324
and started playing
in a little garage band.

99
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:35,492
" That's the truth, I tell no lie... "

100
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:38,366
Back in the "60s
there were so many kids",

101
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:41,066
and neighborhoods were such a big deal,

102
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,370
that you could field a baseball team,

103
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:48,073
a football team,
and you could also field a band.

104
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:54,116
I was 21 years old
when we started that commercial studio

105
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,918
and I probably looked to people
like I was about 16.

106
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,084
There was no reason for those people
to think I knew what I was doing.

107
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:11,125
When I was in junior high school,
we were making recordings in my house.

108
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,638
Every kid was going out
and buying a guitar

109
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,072
or a drum set or something
and starting a band.

110
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,975
So we had plenty of guinea pigs

111
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,036
to experiment on and then we would go

112
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,139
and have 45 records pressed

113
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,377
and we'd try to sell them locally

114
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:27,351
and actually had fairly good luck.

115
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:44,093
And I was asked to join
a kind of successful local band

116
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,501
who made records.

117
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,836
So it was just something
that was easy to fall into.

118
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,939
The first time I saw Alex Chilton,

119
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:55,480
I guess he was 11 or 12 years old.

120
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,516
Now Alex was what I call an art brat.

121
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,915
His mother ran an art gallery.

122
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:03,581
His father was
a hobbyist clarinet player.

123
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:08,184
Bill Eggleston, the Memphis
art photographer, had given him peyote

124
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,320
and he was running around
with his eyes

125
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:13,797
spinning like that
and his hair sticking out.

126
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:16,835
And I thought, "Well,
this kid's gonna have a unique life."

127
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:21,700
I got sent to Central for one year

128
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:26,108
in the 10th grade
and Alex was in my geometry room.

129
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:30,206
And I noticed that, you know,
"Alex... he's not here today."

130
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,217
And then the next geometry class

131
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,482
I said, "He's not here again today.
You know, what's going on?"

132
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,989
And, where is Alex, you know?

133
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,563
" Give me a ticket for an aeroplane. "

134
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,962
" Ain't got time
to take a fast train... "

135
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,831
He says he was 15.
I think he was 14.

136
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:52,234
The second time
he ever sang in a microphone,

137
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,863
he recorded 'the Letter.

138
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,738
And as they say, you know,
the rest was history.

139
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,354
" I was... "

140
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,929
" All night long I toss and turn. "

141
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,994
" With you on my mind. "

142
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:28,336
" Memories of you, girl. "

143
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:30,671
" I can't seem to leave behind. "

144
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,404
" Calling night and day... "

145
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,913
Stax had been re-equipping their studio,

146
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:40,180
which before 1966 had
had very primitive equipment,

147
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:43,347
and we happened to buy
our mixing console

148
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:47,415
and our first multi-track recorder
from the same company.

149
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:50,291
So almost immediately we started

150
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,025
to get all of the overflow work
from Stax.

151
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,397
So instead of recording
high school bands,

152
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,766
we were recording
Booker T and the MG's

153
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,532
and lsaac Hayes sessions.

154
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,095
It was a little daunting.

155
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:03,300
You know, if you wanted
more staff or more engineers,

156
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,173
you had to train them yourself.

157
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:10,406
I actually set up sort of a little
recording school at the studio

158
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:13,646
and when I walked into my office,

159
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,279
there was somebody
sitting behind my desk

160
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:21,224
in my chair with their boots
up on my desk, smoking a cigarette.

161
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,922
And I said,
"Who the heck is this?"

162
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,734
Chris and I were at MUS,

163
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,829
'the best boys" private school
in Memphis.

164
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,931
What they wore
and the music they were into,

165
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,135
he very much rebelled against it.

166
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,576
And I kind of picked up on that.

167
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:42,910
We were interested
in how to get the textures

168
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,075
and fuzz-tones and how to sound like

169
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,516
Jeff Beck or Jimmy Page.

170
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:51,250
You know what? If somebody
went through the recording school

171
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,622
and we thought they were doing
some pretty good music,

172
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,524
we'd give them the key
to the studio and say,

173
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,793
"When it's not being used,
you can come in and record your ideas."

174
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,356
Chris was not so much
an electronics guy

175
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,494
as he was a sonics guy.

176
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:08,267
" How do we get this piece
of equipment to get this sound

177
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,400
that I've got locked in my head?"

178
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,278
Jimi Hendrix had happened
and the Yardbirds were happening

179
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,508
and I remember
when Chris and those guys

180
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,015
played in the school cafeteria,

181
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,484
I was, like, wow!
I mean, "Here's some of these guys

182
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,885
that are really actually out
trying to do this stuff. "

183
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,616
Chris and I just sort of hit it off

184
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,851
"cause we were interested
in these same things."

185
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:31,162
We were pretty...
inseparable in those days,

186
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,710
you know, because we actually
lived with each other at college.

187
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,540
I was sort of an audiophile
and I had stereo equipment

188
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,906
that was better than most people had.

189
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,945
So a lot of times people
would wind up in my room.

190
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:55,015
Chris always had a full-body,

191
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:59,046
purple aura every time
you were doing acid.

192
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,387
We all would say,

193
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,139
"Whoa, what is this all about?"
You know?

194
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:10,068
Andy and Chris
had sort of convinced people

195
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:13,435
that they were
expert drug tasters or whatever.

196
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:17,135
I think, you know, they were
pretty high most of the time.

197
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,467
He came back a very different person.

198
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,738
I remember we were in the living room
of his mother's house

199
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,871
and he had on the wall
a framed gold record

200
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:56,471
for "Cry Like a Baby."

201
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:00,383
And the label had peeled off
of the 45 record

202
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:04,480
and was laying down in the corner
of the frame like a dead bug.

203
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,422
Alex really liked that.

204
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:09,757
" Free again to end my longing... "

205
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,456
Chris and I came back to Memphis

206
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,761
and we both had our fill
of going away to college...

207
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,631
no car, having to live
in a dorm room,

208
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:19,466
can't play music,
no place to develop your pictures.

209
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,096
You know, it was really a drag.

210
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,903
So Chris and I started
working on Chris's back house.

211
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:27,412
We got what musical equipment
we had and moved it back there

212
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,643
and started playing a little bit.
So we said, "Well, we need a drummer."

213
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,149
I said, " Oh, well, I know
this guy Jody Stephens,

214
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,413
who I played with back
in the 9th grade."

215
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,852
" To do what I want again..."

216
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,412
When I was a teenager,
I felt like an oddball.

217
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,654
Music was something that made me feel

218
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,251
like part of a community.

219
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:47,527
Chris and Alex and Andy
and John Fry...

220
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,261
it's a society of oddballs.

221
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:50,529
" Well, I made a mistake..."

222
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,264
Alex had already made enough money

223
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,579
that his parents had put it
in some kind of a trust fund.

224
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,041
He went and bought
his own car and drove it around.

225
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:01,307
He was kind of surviving off

226
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,314
being or having been
a professional musician,

227
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,111
which was a big mystery to me.

228
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:08,153
How can anybody do that?
Surely you don't make money doing this.

229
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,553
We're just doing this
"cause it's cool, you know.

230
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,957
" When you smile, you make... "

231
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:20,055
Alex... life was so far off the chart...

232
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,656
no real pun intended...

233
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,669
while Chris was
having to clean out

234
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,830
the pool on Saturdays.

235
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,737
I think he felt like such a victim,

236
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,743
because his father made him
clean out the pool.

237
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,413
We would stand out in front
of the old building over on National.

238
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,716
"Well, what do you want to do now?"
"Well, you know..."

239
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:45,348
Chris would say,
"Get Alex in the band."

240
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:50,556
Chris was very... I think he knew

241
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,826
what he wanted in terms
of band members,

242
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:57,232
and he had this pretty specific idea

243
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,329
about what this band
would sound like musically

244
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:03,136
and how all these pieces
would fit together.

245
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,255
Should I use this mic?

246
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,722
Mm-hmm.

247
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,021
I still don't hear myself
through the phones.

248
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:24,392
- How about now?
- Uh, yeah. Wah!

249
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:29,291
And which way should I be
standing in relation to this mic?

250
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,233
In front of it.

251
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,634
We had sort of weaseled
our way into Ardent a little bit

252
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,108
and we actually were allowed
to go into the studio

253
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,611
late at night,
starting to put down...

254
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,044
no kidding... real tracks.

255
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,105
I even think
we got our very own private

256
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,616
full-blown reel of tape.

257
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,152
We'd just been using
scraps up till then.

258
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,415
Can I put on some back-up
before it's late?

259
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,218
Mmhmm.
And do the piano.

260
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,932
- Got a light?
- They're over there.

261
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:12,637
The bands I'd been in prior to
Big Star didn't have access to a studio

262
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:17,011
and that very beneficial time
of evolving as a musician

263
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,312
and being able to do that in a studio.

264
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,696
Once you step into that
and kind of discover

265
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,324
what you can do creatively,

266
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,335
I don't know that there is
any kind of feeling like it.

267
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:43,000
" When my baby's beside me... "

268
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,838
- Ah!
- We should have done.

269
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:49,779
- "When My Baby's Beside Me" acoustic.
- One, two, three, four...

270
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:59,049
Very quickly
we became sort of an organic thing.

271
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,718
We jived with each other,
we bonded.

272
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,194
I think a little less vocal
and a little bit more guitars.

273
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,821
A little less of the other vocals.

274
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:11,332
The focus was original music.

275
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,633
Alex and Chris were creating music

276
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,333
that was as relevant

277
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:18,501
and connected as emotionally to me

278
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:21,239
as all this cover material
that I had been doing.

279
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,508
Those two were like a couple of comets

280
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,641
or shooting stars
or something like that.

281
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,686
Jody and I were kind of caught up

282
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,277
in the bow wave of Chris and Alex.

283
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:35,359
- Tell me when.
- Now.

284
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,758
I didn't get to hear
much Big Star music

285
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,827
because they usually
wouldn't write in the studio.

286
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:50,068
When they showed up
with the first songs for "#1 Record,"

287
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,542
they basically had the arrangements

288
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:55,239
completely together the way
they wanted to do them.

289
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:59,273
They came in, they set up
as a four-piece band in the studio,

290
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,252
everybody playing
on the basic tracks

291
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:05,188
simultaneously
and that was the first time

292
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:08,624
I was hearing those tunes.

293
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,959
Rolling.

294
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:29,308
" Years ago
my heart was set to live, oh. "

295
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:36,310
" But I've been trying hard
against unbelievable odds..."

296
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,880
Sitting down
to go through 'the Ballad of El Goodo"

297
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:44,088
it seems like we'd run
through that song one time

298
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,495
and then the next time
it just all clicked.

299
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,762
It was pretty much realized

300
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,359
the way you hear it on the album.

301
00:17:53,639 --> 00:18:00,841
" And there ain't no one going
to turn me "round."

302
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:07,443
" Ain't no one going
to turn me "round... "

303
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,181
Even just hearing the tracks...
the two guitars, the bass,

304
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,315
and the drums... I said,

305
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,087
"You know, if they've got any lyrics

306
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,993
that are halfway decent to go
with this, we've got something."

307
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:24,901
" Ain't no one going
to turn me "round... "

308
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:33,107
Al Bell at Stax came to us and said,

309
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,646
" Stax would like
to have a rock brand.

310
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:38,774
Would you be interested in having
Ardent Records be that brand? "

311
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,012
And I said, "Well, of course."

312
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:43,145
Chris knew that that was coming.

313
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:45,850
I told him, I said, " You know,
if you guys get a good album together,

314
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:49,553
we've got a good vehicle, I think,
for putting some of this music out."

315
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:06,308
I can't get over how really nice
the Mellotron sounds on that.

316
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:10,144
This one wouldn't make
a bad single probably.

317
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:13,150
I think the name Big Star
was just desperation.

318
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,743
We needed to have a name
and nobody could think of a name

319
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,312
and when we were
sitting out in between

320
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,914
the old shack on National

321
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,983
and the actual storefront studio

322
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,552
smoking I don't know what...
smoking something.

323
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:28,671
And there was, of course, the Big Star
grocery store right across the street.

324
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,563
You know, we could have
been jinxing our future

325
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:38,201
by calling ourselves Big Star
and our first album "#1 Record."

326
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:41,075
I do remember feeling
really uncomfortable

327
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:44,377
with the name
because it was so pretentious.

328
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:50,795
Do you want me to do that?

329
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,087
Yeah, I like that.

330
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:56,855
I would normally turn
most of the overdubbing to them

331
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,625
because Chris could engineer
plenty good enough.

332
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,427
You know, I had other work to do.

333
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,628
I wasn't particularly anxious
to be there 24/7, so.

334
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,472
Before all that
got too awfully far along,

335
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,879
the move to Madison Avenue occurred

336
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:21,477
where Ardent moved from their
old storefront on National Street

337
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,748
over to this big,
wonderful new studio.

338
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:26,814
They just did everything technically
that you could imagine doing

339
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,621
and there's still studios to this day,

340
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,992
I'm sure, that don't light
a candle to it.

341
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,894
I felt like I'd walked
into the Disney World

342
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,557
of music at that point.

343
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:38,125
John Fry likes toys and equipment,
things like that,

344
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:41,172
so we had the first Mellotron
in the United States.

345
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,231
We had George Harrison's keyboard.

346
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,606
It had come in for service
and been swapped out,

347
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,201
so we ended up getting his Moog.

348
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,008
Ardent provided, you know,
a real high-tech environment

349
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:59,183
and when Stax started doing really well,
there was an overflow of business.

350
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,782
I think Terry did
The Staple Singers one,

351
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,520
which was a great record.

352
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,427
So that kind of work
was going on over in A Studio

353
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:08,489
and we sort of staked out B Studio
as our own little space.

354
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:12,162
Big Star just spent a lot of time
in there finishing up that first LP.

355
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:17,638
" Don't give up on me so fast... "

356
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,677
I had
a little bit of an attitude back then.

357
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,508
You know, when I would
walk through the room

358
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,309
and I would hear them
working on something,

359
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:27,045
you know, they struck me
as a little amateurish.

360
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,780
You know,
I already had it in my mind

361
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,049
what something would
end up sounding like,

362
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:35,025
you know, if Brian Wilson
has got his hands on it

363
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:37,357
or Phil Spector or George Martin.

364
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:41,331
I remember hearing "#1 Record"
after it was mixed...

365
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:47,566
and... just being floored, just floored.

366
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,940
" Girlfriend, what are you doing? "

367
00:21:56,782 --> 00:22:00,081
" You're driving me to ruin... "

368
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,552
it's 9:29 on WMC-FM Memphis

369
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:05,146
and speaking of Big Star, a couple
of members of the group are here...

370
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:06,824
Andy Hummel
and Alex Chilton are with us.

371
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:09,861
A lot of excitement about this album.
Is the album out yet in the stores?

372
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,829
Yeah, the album
should have hit the stores today.

373
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,593
"#1 Record" is the very first

374
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:18,500
from Big Star
and you won't forget, will you?

375
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,231
Here it is only January

376
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:22,933
and you're getting an awful lot
of critical acclaim for your new album.

377
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,569
Yeah, that's nice. I hope it sells.

378
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:28,875
We got a great review from "Cash Box"

379
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:31,609
and "Billboard" and "Rolling Stone."

380
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,173
That was looking good.

381
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:48,858
You know,
in a way the back-house crew

382
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:53,530
moved over to Ardent,
and I was part of that crew.

383
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:54,970
We shot some film.

384
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,975
We all loved music,
and we'd hang out together.

385
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:03,037
And then I was asked by John
to do the art and advertising.

386
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,583
" Look at the sun... "

387
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,983
it was pretty exciting,
especially getting the album.

388
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:15,049
Great front cover
that Carole Manning shot

389
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:19,063
and the back that... I think John Fry
actually wound up shooting that.

390
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:22,658
Chris persuaded John
that I needed to be aboard,

391
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,929
"cause we were all
going to be a success.

392
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:28,166
And if I couldn't be in the band,
I needed to be there.

393
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,174
And with my college radio experience

394
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,834
he would like to have somebody

395
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,470
focusing on Big Star all the time.

396
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,307
Chris was a master manipulator

397
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,578
and I wanted, you know,
something to do,

398
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:43,553
and so Chris found me
as a willing participant.

399
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,323
Yeah.

400
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:54,957
- Tell me about the Ardent family.
- Bizarre.

401
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,967
We've got a big new studio here.

402
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:58,627
We're a real company.

403
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,694
We're not operating
out of anybody's backyard anymore.

404
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,036
We've got a big label behind us.

405
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,373
Yeah, you're damn right
there were expectations.

406
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:10,438
I realized that it was
a matter of probabilities,

407
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,710
but for Chris it was 100% certain

408
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,514
that this thing was gonna all take off.

409
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:25,359
After all these years
of just listening to music

410
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:29,366
and just looking at the covers
and studying everything

411
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:33,200
about a Beatle cover,
it was like a dream.

412
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:38,004
We were so fortunate
to have landed in this spot doing this

413
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:40,010
that I think we kind of thought,

414
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:41,943
"Well, this is how life is.."

415
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,082
Savoy Brown will not be able to appear.

416
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,141
Now, Friday, August 25th,

417
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:51,383
at the auditorium plan to see
Cactus plus Rory Gallagher

418
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,890
and special guest stars Bloodrock.

419
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,324
Tickets are $3.50.

420
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,107
I worked at Pop Tunes

421
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,906
from 1970 to "73."

422
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:17,415
On every other aisle in the store

423
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:19,074
were two record players

424
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,277
so people could listen to the music.

425
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,787
Saturday afternoons, there'd sometimes

426
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,789
be everything from John Lee Hooker,

427
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,917
you know, to Led Zeppelin
and Ray Conniff,

428
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,859
all blasting at one time.

429
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,302
Ardent and Stax naturally

430
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,395
always got preferential treatment.

431
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,201
When Big Star showed up...

432
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:45,038
I mean, I even remember
where it was on the floor.

433
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,544
It just didn't look
like a Memphis record.

434
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,705
Big Star came out of the gate

435
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:53,979
with a kind of finely-tooled precision.

436
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:03,386
The whole time
we were promoting Big Star,

437
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:07,329
Stax is sending over
posters of lsaac Hayes.

438
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,094
"Hot Buttered Soul,"

439
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:12,796
totally distracted towards
where this big acceptance

440
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,771
and these big sales were coming from.

441
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:17,672
But that's just a microcosm
of what was going on

442
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,175
in the whole industry.

443
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,974
All the resources get put
behind the big sellers,

444
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,480
guys that have the potential

445
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:26,608
to become the Elton Johns
of the world.

446
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:30,621
I make 50 calls a day
to radio program directors

447
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,452
and they'd say, "Well, you know,

448
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,116
have you got any records
in the stores yet?

449
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:36,956
I mean, we're not getting
any report of any sales."

450
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:41,995
What's going on? You know?

451
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:44,934
We've got all these great reviews.

452
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:47,096
Stax seems behind it.

453
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:48,332
The record's great.

454
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:50,772
You know,
what is going on out there?

455
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:52,366
And that's "out there"...

456
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,106
it's such a netherworld, you know.

457
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,375
You don't know what is out there.

458
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:03,651
" Be my friend... "

459
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,713
You know, we were all frustrated.

460
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:10,022
Picking up "Rolling Stone" magazine
and it says,

461
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:12,996
'this is the greatest stuff
we've ever heard.."

462
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:17,635
And, you know, nobody is buying it

463
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:20,432
and you can't find it in a record store.

464
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:25,668
People would call
from different parts of the country

465
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:29,908
and just say, "Wow.
Where can I find this record?

466
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:33,212
I just heard it
on my local radio station."

467
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:36,651
At some point a decision was made

468
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:40,054
that we really needed
more promotional help,

469
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,525
which, in fact, is probably
not what we needed.

470
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,926
Probably what we needed
was distribution help,

471
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,760
but John was brought in on a retainer

472
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,926
and hired to sort of coordinate
the promotion effort.

473
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,733
It was like they kind of needed

474
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:57,070
somebody to beat
a drum and light a fire.

475
00:27:57,142 --> 00:28:02,170
I got through to more people
when the Argent record,

476
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,215
"Hold Your Head Up"...
when that was out,

477
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:07,274
"cause when I'd say "Ardent"
they thought I was saying "Argent.."

478
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,651
"Ooh, yeah, hey. Remember that."
 And so...

479
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:14,717
Al Bell wanted to have
more of a presence

480
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,920
in the pop market
or the white market

481
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:18,553
or whatever you want to call it.

482
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,222
But I never got

483
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:24,564
a sense of how they planned
to forge a beachhead

484
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:26,627
in the pop or Top 40.

485
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:35,575
There was always a band.

486
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:39,378
So I would be lugging
around my 15-year-old,

487
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:42,978
14-year-old brother
with amps and P.A. systems

488
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,453
and what-have-you.

489
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,618
"#1 Record" was being
recorded the year

490
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:52,151
that I was in France
when I escaped Memphis.

491
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,892
And it was at that time
I remember being home

492
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:58,333
and Christopher played me
on his stereo,

493
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,270
up in his room, "#1 Record."

494
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,508
" Won't you let me
walk you home from school? "

495
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:17,481
Oh.

496
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:21,514
I'm not ashamed to say, but I cried.

497
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:26,428
It was just, you know,
this is your kid brother

498
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,796
and you've known all these years

499
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:32,303
how he had progressed
and what he wanted.

500
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,032
And it was like, 'my God,
you've come out with something..."

501
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:39,543
I don't know that I'd...
it wasn't the Beatles

502
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:43,570
but it was damn good.
It was great.

503
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,451
Things started going sour for Chris

504
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:54,049
when he started reading
reviews of "#1 Record."

505
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:57,185
it was such a large part
of his kind of creative vision

506
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:00,390
that when the press
started coming back

507
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,899
and focusing on Alex,

508
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,162
I think he thought he might have to live

509
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:07,568
under that shadow from that point.

510
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:11,837
" Rock and Roll is here to stay. "

511
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,673
" Come inside where it's okay... "

512
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,077
I'm sure that was
a factor in, you know,

513
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:19,514
his emotional problems that he
started having around that time.

514
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:22,348
I mean, the guy, he poured
his heart and his soul into this thing,

515
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,514
so I guess he felt kind of betrayed.

516
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:32,328
Chris is in every way a tragic figure,

517
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:36,231
but you're dealing
with a reality and a fantasy.

518
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:39,737
Big Star never had
to face the big mirror,

519
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:41,601
you know, just staring yourself

520
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,608
right in the face night after night,

521
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,871
trying to pay
for the damn bus, you know.

522
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:49,607
I mean,
so the fantasy which all starts

523
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,013
when you're strumming
your tennis racket

524
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,108
in front of the mirror,
you know...

525
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:58,417
the fantasy was able to grow
until it blew up.

526
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:02,391
" If it's so, well, let me know "

527
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,257
" if it's no, well, I can go... "

528
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,627
Late in the day
he came by the studio

529
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:12,261
and was arguing with me.
Then he stomped off and left

530
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:15,135
and I... you know,
I went home and, you know,

531
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,970
I got a call from Richard Rosebrough

532
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,101
who was down at the studio and said,

533
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:23,636
"Chris is back up here
and he's erasing the multitrack tapes

534
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,546
for "#1 Record."

535
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,586
My father, with incredible
understatement and euphemism,

536
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:37,059
picked me up at the airport
around Christmastime

537
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:40,154
of "72 and said",

538
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,665
"Well, we've had some trouble at home.."

539
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,498
He apparently took a bunch of pills

540
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,471
of some kind and...

541
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,099
wound up in the hospital.

542
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,203
So that was a...

543
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:58,109
That was a sad day.

544
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,914
What do you think?

545
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:04,977
It's very nice.

546
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:10,319
One, two, three, four...

547
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:13,159
" You feel sad "

548
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:19,136
" 'Cause I got mad and I'm sorry... "

549
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:24,173
I love "#1 Record"
and I think it's probably

550
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:27,302
one of the most peculiarly

551
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:29,437
sequenced records,

552
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:32,108
because it starts off
with all this bravado

553
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:34,981
of "Feel," you know,
and "In the Street,"

554
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:38,113
you know, and it's got
these really great...

555
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:40,680
you know, 'don't Lie To Me"...
these moments.

556
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:43,352
And then the record
just sort of slides

557
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:45,896
into this kind of melancholia.

558
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,691
I mean, "Watch the Sunrise"

559
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:52,998
is sort of like this
last glimmer of hope

560
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,699
that sort of sparkles a little bit,

561
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:58,970
you know,
right before it just totally fades out.

562
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:15,153
" I can feel it, now it's time... "

563
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:17,660
By "72 I'd started sending reviews in

564
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,219
and I was getting
published here and there.

565
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:20,730
So I was starting to get
on mailing lists

566
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:23,232
and I would get the occasional album
in the mail, which was very thrilling

567
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:26,168
to get an actual record album
in the mail for free.

568
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:30,606
And I opened it and that, you know,
that laminated cover with the neon sign,

569
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:35,169
it was a eureka moment
hearing "#1 Record" for the first time,

570
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:38,738
an absolute life-changing moment.

571
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,307
I played it. It would end.
I'd play it again.

572
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:49,460
I really remember hearing
Big Star clearly for the first time.

573
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,256
I was on Silas Creek Parkway
in North Carolina.

574
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:54,856
I'd just gone through the light.
"Baby's Beside Me" came on the radio.

575
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:56,422
I was driving an old Thunderbird

576
00:33:56,501 --> 00:34:00,028
and I started going way over
the speed limit really quickly.

577
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:03,096
It was really exciting.
Big Star had a song in the Top 10,

578
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:06,075
or Top 20 anyway,
in my hometown, and I thought

579
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:08,203
this was the same all over the world.

580
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:10,474
I knew the people over at WTOB,

581
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,573
and the DJ's would make extra money

582
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,448
by selling their promos... records.

583
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,886
I probably bought
all their copies for a dollar

584
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,980
and it meant they didn't even
have copies to play.

585
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,821
So I probably wrecked the chance

586
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,861
of Big Star getting
any more famous in Winston.

587
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,102
Okeydoke.

588
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:15,339
These are books which I can't...

589
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:18,780
don't have room for...
oh, Spector, I loved him.

590
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:22,547
And now these are the Beatles

591
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,386
and then Big Star's got a section.

592
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:30,257
And of course KISS which I'll never
listen to, but gotta have it.

593
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,593
Ooh, Sinead O'Connor,
I love her.

594
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,123
She's so serious, you know.

595
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:41,604
I've got, like, Dance and Techno
and House in these cases.

596
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,037
I'm into hits. I love hits,

597
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:47,407
no matter where they come from.

598
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,537
'this is the Rock Writers" Convention

599
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:51,081
where Big Star performed.

600
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,516
I put a page ad in "Billboard"

601
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:57,486
and then flew in a hundred or so

602
00:35:57,555 --> 00:36:01,321
of the leading music-publication
people back then.

603
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:03,360
"Rolling Stone," of course, "Circus,."

604
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:05,520
"Crawdaddy,"
"Creem," "Fusion."

605
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:07,860
When you came up
with this idea for the Rock Writers,

606
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:10,264
was that a real earnest thing
that you just thought

607
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,064
- they needed a union or something?
- Very much so.

608
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:14,832
See nobody ever...
they just thought,

609
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:18,706
"Oh, this guy in Memphis wanted
everybody to see Big Star.."

610
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:20,437
That was definitely part of it

611
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:24,277
but no, they needed
some sort of organization.

612
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,838
Hard as hell to get paid

613
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:29,444
and nobody really
respected them at the time,

614
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,147
but they sure do now.

615
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,191
The day before
my birthday in April of "73

616
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:42,562
I got this package in the mail

617
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:45,898
and I just flipped.

618
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,531
And it was just,
"I'm gonna get invited to a junket."

619
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:52,303
I remember
they called 'Creem's office and said,

620
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,741
"We're going to take everybody.."

621
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:55,608
And I go, "Everybody?".

622
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,549
"Creem" magazine, we made $22.75
on the weeks that we got paid.

623
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:02,142
Like, "We won the lottery."

624
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:07,985
What exactly we hoped to accomplish

625
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,495
was open to debate,
but we all had a ticket,

626
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,998
a hotel and freedom
to run around Memphis.

627
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:19,397
" I wish I could meet Elvis..."

628
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:22,769
They put us in a school bus
and they made this big deal

629
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,604
that we were going to go to Graceland
and maybe see Elvis.

630
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:28,144
I remember seeing the gates
with the musical notes,

631
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:30,237
and they came out and said,
"Elvis has left the city."

632
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:32,339
Elvis was not there.

633
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,748
I vividly remember looking over,

634
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,912
you know,
Lester Bangs and Richard Meltzer,

635
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,683
the two of them are standing there

636
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,623
pissing through the gates at Graceland.

637
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:43,523
And I just thought,
"if this isn't what it's all about,

638
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:44,618
I don't know what is."

639
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:48,988
I just sort of
showed up for the second day

640
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:51,762
and they gave me a press pass
and I met Lester Bangs.

641
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:56,273
He was doing so much speed that...
he could barely talk.

642
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,967
He just went, 'mm-hmm."

643
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:03,376
This is perhaps the most bland time
in the history of western civilization.

644
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,280
Now the difference between this and 1967

645
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,511
is stupefying.

646
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:12,652
Lester Bangs came out
so irreverent and so clever.

647
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,557
He never treated musicians

648
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,115
like they were any different than us.

649
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:19,128
There was the sense
that the edifice of Rock and Roll

650
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:21,187
had gotten a little unwieldy.

651
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:22,960
That resulted in records

652
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:26,197
that had lost some passion, perhaps.

653
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,898
In about 1971, that's when I started

654
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,168
to really hate hippie shit.

655
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:34,302
I mean, I liked radical politics,

656
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:37,541
but I saw hippies
as just mainly getting high

657
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:40,345
and "Let's... let's get high and ball!"

658
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:43,182
I gave my life to Rock and Roll music.

659
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,812
It had been taken away from me

660
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:47,084
just as I was getting
old enough to really enjoy it.

661
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,888
You know, everything
got bloated into heaviosity.

662
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,397
It started becoming
more product and less art.

663
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:56,933
I guess we just
felt like we were trying to reclaim

664
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:00,095
that attitude that had been there

665
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:03,231
at the beginning of Rock,
you know, stripping everything back

666
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:06,606
to where it's all started from
and let's try this again.

667
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,611
" I really don't wanna go..."

668
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,842
I remember there was
a meeting the morning of,

669
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,077
I think, the second day
where we were supposed

670
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:16,745
to elect a president of the organization

671
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,755
and draft minutes for the meeting,

672
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:20,085
but it was anarchy.

673
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:23,251
It was like that cliché,
like herding cats.

674
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:24,885
We didn't want to be organized.

675
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:26,953
You know, our gift was chaos.

676
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,966
The last night they had a big concert

677
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,468
with the acts that were on Ardent.

678
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,266
The rock writers
were just yawning and going,

679
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:39,400
"Yeah! This is horrible!"
And then Big Star came on.

680
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:41,911
The flower that had blossomed

681
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:46,416
when I heard "#1 Record," re-blossomed.
They were just great.

682
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,154
As soon as they started playing

683
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,160
all the rock writers started dancing

684
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,628
and Richard started taking his pants off

685
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:01,995
on the dance floor
while Big Star was playing.

686
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:05,160
So he danced in his
tighty-whiteys for a while.

687
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,670
" 'Cause when my baby's beside me... "

688
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:10,798
I had seen Big Star
a number of times before then

689
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:14,003
and they never got that kind
of response. No one ever adored them.

690
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,012
This hand-picked perfect audience.

691
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:20,646
That was really, to me,
where we all came together.

692
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:23,619
I still marvel at the fact
that Ardent Records paid

693
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:26,656
to get 140 rock writers
in the same place.

694
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:30,421
Something was forged
in that ridiculous moment

695
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:33,486
of a record company
trying to organize us.

696
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:35,794
No one forgot those few days.

697
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:37,595
I mean, not a whole lot of business

698
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:38,965
got accomplished then,

699
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:42,096
but it certainly was a galvanizing point

700
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,765
for the whole Big Star thing.

701
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:49,474
"Coming off the performance
at the Rock Writers" Convention

702
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:52,209
certainly had instilled
a new confidence in me

703
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:56,481
and my perception is that the band had
been kind of on hiatus prior to that.

704
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:58,988
So we were all pretty charged about it.

705
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,453
That's a neat sound.

706
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:07,789
- Okay, you're rolling.
- Ready?

707
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,601
Hey, John,
turn up the bass in the headphones.

708
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:27,213
Even before Chris left the band,

709
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:30,742
they had already started
writing some more songs.

710
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,020
I was glad that the band decided

711
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:36,252
that they wanted to make another album,

712
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,522
but things were a little different.

713
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:41,656
Nightclubs
and liquor by the drink in bars...

714
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:43,324
you know, you can almost see

715
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,392
the geography reflected in "Radio City."

716
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:47,695
I need help,

717
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:50,205
ladies and gentlemen.
Rattle my jam.

718
00:41:55,079 --> 00:42:00,039
Memphis did not get liquor
by the drink until August "69."

719
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:01,778
There was a great hue and cry saying,

720
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:05,288
" This is going to turn the youth
of Memphis into degenerates.

721
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:08,689
There's gonna be bars on every corner."
Well, guess what?

722
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:10,659
" Had to leave my home. "

723
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:17,798
" Love my girl, ooh yeah. "

724
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:18,960
" She got to save... "

725
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,527
Fridays was the cornerstone bar

726
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:23,937
and you saw some crazy, crazy people

727
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:28,411
who probably, if say liquor or drugs
or sex had not brought them together,

728
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,276
they would never have been
in the same place,

729
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:32,315
much less the same moral universe.

730
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,580
Everybody who was in the least bit

731
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,952
interested in raising hell
would be there.

732
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:40,490
- Typically we were.
- " How long. "

733
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,724
" Can this go on? "

734
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:47,229
Oh my God, yeah,

735
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:49,596
we'd probably drop a couple of 'ludes

736
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:50,998
and then have drinks

737
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,969
and then we'd go from there,
probably to Fridays

738
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:57,303
and then...
probably to a liquor store

739
00:42:57,374 --> 00:42:59,274
and then probably to oblivion.

740
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:05,171
When we would party,
I mean, where do we go?

741
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,773
We'd go back to the studio,

742
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,613
"cause we were having so much fun."

743
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:10,483
Fry would find us wrapped up

744
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:14,650
in drum blankets
on the floor of the studio.

745
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:24,964
Big Star will
be playing at Max's Kansas City

746
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:27,128
from tomorrow through Monday.

747
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:28,364
It's in the city.

748
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,603
Stax cut a deal
to be distributed by Columbia.

749
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:37,841
So when we went to New York
it was another attempt to get attention,

750
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:41,282
to meet with the man
who negotiated the deal with Stax.

751
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,786
That took a long time to set that up.

752
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:46,687
We had to buy a beaucoup of airtime.

753
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:49,157
One, two, three, four...

754
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:56,799
There was a showcase.

755
00:43:56,867 --> 00:44:00,030
So anybody that had been in Memphis,
any of the New York people or...

756
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:03,562
I mean, I know I sat at the bar
between Richard and Nick.

757
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:07,805
They were like
this reluctant rock band,

758
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:11,177
yet there they were with that
ironic name, "Big Star."

759
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,653
Those of us that were writing
or trying to write about them a little

760
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:22,385
knew that we were gonna have
to go through the magazine route.

761
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:25,656
Unfortunately, I think to some of us the
prospects of helping somebody get big

762
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:28,254
was not really what we were hoping for.

763
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:31,699
We wanted them to be a tiny band
that everybody listened to.

764
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:41,209
This is taking a bit of a left turn.

765
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:43,337
" I'm driving alone..."

766
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:47,407
This is probably the best song
to me on "Radio City."

767
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:50,044
That second album to me
was just... it was just one of those...

768
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,920
almost the perfect record.
All the songs had a sensibility

769
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:58,860
and a feel and a certain
kind of, um, a mystery.

770
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:01,397
This was not a record
that revealed itself fast.

771
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:04,161
When you listened to these songs,
they were complicated.

772
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:09,867
" Better not leave me here... "

773
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:13,068
You got to feel the emotional depth

774
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:17,477
and angst that was within the band.

775
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:21,951
" Ooh, I want you here..."

776
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:28,317
I look at "Radio City"
as a transitional record.

777
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:32,590
It's the pristine brilliance
of the first record,

778
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:34,631
but it's the beginning of the unfraying

779
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:36,290
and the sound of falling apart.

780
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,706
" You're gonna die. "

781
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,309
" Yes, you're gonna die. "

782
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:53,508
" Right now. "

783
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:03,489
Love that ending.

784
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,462
Uh, those last few chords
that Nick Lowe later stole.

785
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,932
When you hear
a really great guitar sound,

786
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:13,435
that sounds really unique,

787
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:15,028
like even just at the beginning
of "September Gurls,"

788
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,629
the way the guitar sounds
right at the beginning,

789
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:19,369
that sound is just...
it 's one of these things that's just...

790
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:23,470
you know, it's like... osmosis.
It just kind of goes right into you.

791
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:28,177
" September gurls do so much. "

792
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:32,552
" I was your butch
and you were touched. "

793
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:36,320
" I loved you,
well, never mind... "

794
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:38,861
I think "' September Gurls" is probably

795
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:41,796
as close to a big hit
as they would have.

796
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:44,129
It's a good hit.
And, you know,

797
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:48,069
the fact that it wasn't
on every radio station

798
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:51,039
in America is, you know,

799
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:54,077
the target practice
of the music business.

800
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,873
You know,
sometimes you just miss.

801
00:46:58,048 --> 00:46:59,845
" September gurls... "

802
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:02,477
There is that,
you would tag things with "City."

803
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:04,487
if you're in a Rock and Roll band,
"Rock City."

804
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:07,353
if something bad happened,
it'd be "Drag City."

805
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:08,857
And "Radio City,"

806
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:12,225
we all thought this was
a radio-friendly album.

807
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:18,614
" She's a schemer
and she makes me bad... "

808
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:20,865
Columbia was gonna be our savior

809
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:23,736
and we now had
a real distribution company.

810
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:27,504
But they didn't give a damn
about Ardent Records.

811
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:30,069
It was a different game, you know.

812
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:33,583
They were used to dealing in tonnage.

813
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,346
For Stax to get picked up
and distributed by Columbia

814
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:40,219
was supposed to be going big time.

815
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,281
Well, it's a comedy of errors here

816
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:46,056
but shortly after the Stax
distribution deal, we get word

817
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:49,621
that Clive Davis, the man
who negotiated the deal with Stax,

818
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:53,466
is being investigated
for improper spending

819
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,802
on his expense account
and they fired him.

820
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:01,942
The offices of Stax here are closed.

821
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:05,140
A lot of other problems
have also plagued the firm.

822
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,614
The latest came yesterday.

823
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:09,413
A judge declared the firm
officially bankrupt.

824
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:28,664
I was already feeling the pressure

825
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:32,300
of having to make the eventual decision
of school or band.

826
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:35,402
Having that decision in my head
was causing me to sort of morph away

827
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:37,845
from the band quite a bit.

828
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,907
So my departure from Big Star
had started back that early.

829
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:44,010
Obviously, Chris had already
departed and Alex...

830
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:47,818
that left Alex kind of on his own,
Jody being Jody.

831
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:52,055
And so the boys club, if there was one,
was kind of falling apart at that point.

832
00:48:57,901 --> 00:48:59,960
John Lightman is
our brand-new bass player.

833
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:01,664
He's only been with us
about three weeks.

834
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:03,467
And...

835
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,838
...he's a fine man.

836
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:08,343
And this is Jody Stephens
back on the drums.

837
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,814
We often played
to rooms that were almost empty

838
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:19,049
and I felt really awful
for how disappointed

839
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:23,650
they were in the lack
of response that they got.

840
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,227
It was sort of chaotic at Ardent

841
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,828
and the future was all unknown.

842
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:40,005
It was... it was sort of in limbo.

843
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:43,475
We had a rehearsal set up there.

844
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:46,141
Jody and I arrived at 2:00
and we waited and waited.

845
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:48,980
And about 5:30
Alex comes sauntering in

846
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:52,078
and he says, "Well, here I am,
but I don't have my guitar.

847
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,146
What do you want to do?"

848
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:57,159
So, you know,
that would be a typical day.

849
00:49:57,227 --> 00:50:00,321
And then after a while
of this sort of thing going on

850
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:02,388
Alex said to me,

851
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:05,629
'my attitude about music is
I could take it or leave it."

852
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:30,423
I met Chris "75.
I was working in CBS Records."

853
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:33,759
He was over with his brother David,
looking for a deal.

854
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:36,526
And there was a guy called John Tobler,
who was like head of press there

855
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,797
at the time and I was
the in-house photographer.

856
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:54,378
There was rumor of... you know,
in working with Geoff Emerick...

857
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:56,942
if he could top anything
that he'd done with Big Star,

858
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,614
it would be amazing.
And we were looking forward to it.

859
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:10,057
He was very kind of... intense, shy.

860
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:12,727
Fortunately, he had David with him,
so he could be the mouthpiece

861
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:16,330
and talk all that business nonsense.
John would put David in contact

862
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,601
with various people
in various record companies.

863
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:25,338
But unfortunately, sadly,

864
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:27,815
as we know,
he never got a deal for it.

865
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:34,982
He was drinking a lot, an awful lot.

866
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:40,326
Steadily, it became kind of more
and more depressing.

867
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:43,195
And, you know,
I was taking him here and there

868
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,632
and wherever
to show him something

869
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:47,670
and maybe get...
you know, show him a good time.

870
00:51:57,848 --> 00:52:01,511
I can always get inspired
by environment.

871
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:04,611
I was taking pictures,
and especially of him.

872
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:07,020
Because I've always had
a dramatic side...

873
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:09,957
was quite aware that...

874
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:12,221
difficult times

875
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:16,857
can be translated
into great photography, great music.

876
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:18,798
And when he saw that picture,

877
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:24,307
we talked about using that
possibly for an album cover.

878
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:28,640
I purposely cut him off
just below the knees

879
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:31,237
and with the background that he had,

880
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:36,251
to make him look like he was kind
of floating in the ether.

881
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:55,731
Come on. Come on.

882
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:03,337
When we walked
this road with Bob Dylan,

883
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:07,941
he said, "Jim, a man could do
a lot of thinking here."

884
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:11,681
And Jim said,
"Bob, I'm thinking all the time."

885
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:14,724
" In the Arizona Prison..."

886
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:17,225
10 years before he ever played on.

887
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:19,455
'time Out Of Mind" with Bob Dylan,

888
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,053
he told me that we had to get out

889
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:22,928
of the big fancy house we lived in...

890
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:25,092
what he called "suburban squalor"...

891
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:27,864
and get to Mississippi
and move in trailers,

892
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:31,237
because otherwise Bob Dylan
would get the wrong message.

893
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:34,300
The idea of living in trailers...
l'd never considered that,

894
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:36,106
but it worked out fantastic.

895
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:37,976
It was our second honeymoon.

896
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:42,579
" Oh, my mouth is dry with dust... "

897
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:46,713
Jim wasn't interested in things that
were real put together or polished or...

898
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:48,917
he was more interested
in the forces of nature.

899
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,657
Here's a good symbol
of Jim's philosophy of art.

900
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,290
It's said that the song
"Dock of the Bay"

901
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:59,460
was written on this piano
by Otis Redding.

902
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:03,063
We turned it into
what is known as yard art,

903
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:07,405
a magnificently manufactured
musical instrument

904
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:09,809
subject to the forces of nature.

905
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:13,838
" A long long way
from here to Tennessee... "

906
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:19,280
There's one thing I learned from Jim...
is that everything is important.

907
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:21,324
" Long long way. "

908
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:24,656
" From me to the girl... "

909
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:27,993
You might say, "that is
the most cluttered room I ever saw."

910
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:32,194
It's his ambience and it's...
his sonic genius is in here.

911
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:36,205
" Will she wait for me? "

912
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,673
Jim's background was theater

913
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:43,179
and he learned early on
that a play comes together

914
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:46,807
and very intense
and real friendships

915
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:50,319
and enemies
are formed that basically

916
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:52,548
only last the life of the play.

917
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,523
He learned about
how to be part of a cast...

918
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:56,991
a cast of characters.

919
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:00,552
" My Lord, he did just what he said... "

920
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,394
You made a point earlier
that Memphis music is what it is

921
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:06,526
because it's done differently
than anywhere else.

922
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:07,797
" Shine on me... "

923
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:11,170
People who have made
Memphis music in the past

924
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:14,574
wouldn't even have the opportunity
to make music other places,

925
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:18,239
from Elvis...
from before Elvis, Robert Johnson.

926
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:22,046
" Shine on me,
well, let it shine on. "

927
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:24,814
" Let it shine on me... "

928
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:26,981
What happened
in Memphis in those years...

929
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:29,082
so much had fallen apart,

930
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,593
yet this was coming together in a way

931
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,720
that nobody could predict or understand

932
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:35,856
what the outcome could possibly be.

933
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:39,868
It was full of energy,
creativeness and always,

934
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:41,597
always trying to push the envelope

935
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:45,266
and in "'Stranded in Canton,"
we definitely did.

936
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,367
That was our scene.

937
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:49,503
I was stranded in Canton.

938
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:50,978
Revolution!

939
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:01,518
Beep beep.

940
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:04,025
I used to go to shows
and see Jim Dickinson.

941
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:05,584
I saw Big Star play.

942
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:10,122
Alex... he and Lesa
introduced me to a social set

943
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,633
where...

944
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:14,602
there were a lot of disconnected,
messed-up people.

945
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:17,469
And I felt right at home.
I said, "I found my social set."

946
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,440
" Shine on me... "

947
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:24,112
There was
some sort of thing that happened

948
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:28,412
with this group of people, especially
around Bill Eggleston, the artist.

949
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:38,890
The standard artistic equation
for that scene

950
00:56:38,962 --> 00:56:43,126
was horror equals beauty,
beauty equals horror.

951
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:47,135
If say something felt terrible,
if something sounded out of tune,

952
00:56:47,203 --> 00:56:51,162
if say something was just wrong,

953
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,868
then somehow
that could become beauty.

954
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:03,284
Alex, Jim, and Bill Eggleston all...

955
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:05,913
for me,
that's all the same body of work.

956
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:07,786
For me it's just visual...

957
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:10,018
and musical.

958
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,687
And Bill thinks of himself
as a musician

959
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:15,697
as much as he thinks of himself
as a photographer.

960
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:41,412
Mm-hmm.

961
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:36,768
Jim was a man who respected tradition.

962
00:58:38,314 --> 00:58:40,908
He talked about
knowing truly great men.

963
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:42,918
These are the truly great men

964
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:46,922
who helped him
make the music of the spheres.

965
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:48,651
This was his shrine.

966
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:52,160
The boys and I put him
front and center.

967
00:58:57,767 --> 00:59:00,031
Jim always said

968
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:02,435
that the part of the recordings

969
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:08,034
that he claimed were the space
between the notes.

970
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:10,944
That's where he wrote his signature.

971
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:13,642
And I think of all his recordings,

972
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:17,311
he succeeded in... in the space

973
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:20,584
between the notes most
with "Big Star Third."

974
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:36,298
I worked with these
other legendary producers

975
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:39,739
and saw that the people
who were the heaviest,

976
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:41,777
were, in fact, doing the least.

977
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:43,607
But that's the way you pull it out.

978
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,739
It's not your record.
It's their record.

979
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:49,342
The producer's name goes
at the bottom of the back

980
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,979
in the smallest typeface known to man.

981
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:54,023
And that's the way it should be.

982
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:57,752
We all had keys to the studio
at that point.

983
00:59:57,827 --> 01:00:00,523
Alex would come in the studio
in the middle of the night with Lesa,

984
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,827
his girlfriend
and the muse of the record,

985
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:05,732
whose importance cannot be overstated.

986
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,168
I come in one morning

987
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:11,331
and he's got this little evil grin
on his face and he said, "Well,

988
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:14,638
Lesa and I cut something last night
I want you to hear."

989
01:00:14,711 --> 01:00:15,939
"Okay, Alex.."

990
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:21,780
So he plays me "Like A Kangaroo,"
which is... it's just 12-string...

991
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:24,285
acoustic 12-string and vocal.

992
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:28,484
I said "Yeah, Alex,
what do you hear on that?"

993
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:31,527
And he says...
again with the evil grin he says,

994
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:34,995
"Well, why don't you produce it,
Mr. Producer?"

995
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:02,691
" I next saw you. "

996
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:09,227
" You was at the party... "

997
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:16,094
But you could hear
how it grew up out of the chaos.

998
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:21,406
That's the space that I don't think
anybody had given him before.

999
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:23,957
" I..."

1000
01:01:29,419 --> 01:01:31,353
" Came against... "

1001
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:34,584
A lot of different things about
how Alex thought about music

1002
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:38,457
were changed
by his influence from Jim.

1003
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:47,295
Alex would be showing someone a song,

1004
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,361
for instance,
showing them how the guitar went,

1005
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,373
maybe noodling around a little bit.

1006
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:54,467
And then they hear Dickinson say,
" You know we were recording.

1007
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,535
That's it, we got it."

1008
01:01:56,612 --> 01:01:57,977
And they'd say, "What?

1009
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:01,448
You know, you were recording that?"
And he'd say, "Yeah."

1010
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:04,748
And he'd say, "it was great. Great.
I wouldn't change a thing."

1011
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:09,257
" Take downs... "

1012
01:02:09,325 --> 01:02:11,384
There was a sense of "How do we get

1013
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:13,759
to complete spontaneity?"

1014
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:16,321
There was a little tendency to be

1015
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:19,459
kind of sonically deconstructive,

1016
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:21,230
and it was pretty clear to me

1017
01:02:21,304 --> 01:02:23,135
that he didn't have much interest

1018
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:27,108
in trying to tailor anything
to have commercial appeal

1019
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:29,838
or to be radio-friendly.

1020
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:34,314
" I'm well versed
in the walls of worst."

1021
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:37,944
" In the windows of most,
wind down..."

1022
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:40,488
I thought it had become an Alex album.

1023
01:02:40,556 --> 01:02:42,649
I thought it was an Alex album.

1024
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:45,785
All of those records
from "#1 Record" through

1025
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:50,424
"Radio City" to the "Third"...
Alex was the commonality.

1026
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,297
He was the common point of all of them.

1027
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:56,134
And as they progressed
they became more Alex records

1028
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:58,139
than Big Star records.

1029
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:00,437
You know, it just...

1030
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:03,035
it became such
a different scene at that point

1031
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:06,445
in terms of where Alex
was going musically,

1032
01:03:06,516 --> 01:03:08,677
in his personality.

1033
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:12,551
It got painful for John. And he did
reach the point where he said,

1034
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,783
"Jim, I know you're not finished,

1035
01:03:14,857 --> 01:03:17,018
but you've got to mix what you've got,

1036
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:18,583
because I can't do this anymore."

1037
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:24,964
" Child, will you come on down? "

1038
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:27,366
The mix is half of the record,

1039
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:31,372
and Alex was excluded
because he would have ruined it.

1040
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,873
" Morning says to idle on. "

1041
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:37,175
" And stay clear of the street. "

1042
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:44,914
" On the wing and on the land... "

1043
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:48,489
I've worked with guys
who were supposed to be

1044
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:51,994
the real guys and none of them
were as good as John.

1045
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:57,522
He would treat classical cello
and sheer distortion, equally.

1046
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,501
You know,
they were both equally musical,

1047
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:03,038
you know, paint that he was
pushing around the canvas.

1048
01:04:04,307 --> 01:04:05,638
" Stroke it Noel... "

1049
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:21,751
it really is this amazing reflection

1050
01:04:21,824 --> 01:04:26,761
of where Alex was at that time
and that lifestyle.

1051
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:29,627
But whether I wanted to sustain

1052
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:33,100
that kind of emotional lifestyle is...

1053
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:34,636
it wasn't for me.

1054
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:37,036
What was the lifestyle?

1055
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:42,043
Oh, it was kind of self-absorption

1056
01:04:42,111 --> 01:04:45,808
and self-focus and...

1057
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:48,407
and drugs and alcohol.

1058
01:04:48,484 --> 01:04:53,148
" Driving in my big black car. "

1059
01:04:56,993 --> 01:04:58,153
" Nothing can go wrong... "

1060
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:00,491
You know, everybody was
kind of down and depressed then.

1061
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,793
You got to remember
our biggest studio customer,

1062
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:06,631
Stax, had just gone out of business,
also leaving us without a distributor

1063
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:09,728
for our record label and, you know,
we were kind of wondering

1064
01:05:09,805 --> 01:05:12,137
was Memphis music now going to implode

1065
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:14,472
and we are
all going to be unemployed.

1066
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,773
The band had fallen apart.

1067
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:20,509
Alex and Lesa were going
through this soap opera

1068
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:23,051
that was their relationship.

1069
01:05:25,888 --> 01:05:29,585
The record was about
deteriorating relationships.

1070
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:31,490
That's what the record is about.

1071
01:05:37,733 --> 01:05:42,966
" Nothing can hurt me. "

1072
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:50,243
" Nothing can touch me. "

1073
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,181
" Why should I care? "

1074
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:58,618
" Driving's a gas "

1075
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:03,716
" it ain't gonna last. "

1076
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:13,232
When I came over here to start working,

1077
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:15,327
John was showing me around the place

1078
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:17,634
and there was a humongous loud noise

1079
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:21,006
coming out of Studio A.
And I was prepared for...

1080
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:22,908
I don't know what I was prepared for,

1081
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:27,006
but I opened the door and it was
just Chris behind the console,

1082
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:30,211
running the tape machine,
punching himself into record

1083
01:06:30,286 --> 01:06:33,744
and out of record and singing
and doing all of it by himself.

1084
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:44,596
He was more concerned
about his solo stuff

1085
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,430
and getting that right,

1086
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:50,233
whatever that definition of that is.
I know he worked on it forever.

1087
01:06:50,306 --> 01:06:52,774
The way that Big Star
was presented to me,

1088
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,537
it was always "Alex, Alex, Alex."

1089
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:57,875
And I didn't realize
until I heard Chris's solo stuff

1090
01:06:57,947 --> 01:07:00,575
how responsible he was
for the whole sound of the band.

1091
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:04,219
" You didn't have to make a scene... "

1092
01:07:05,988 --> 01:07:08,456
Chris just lost interest
in bands period,

1093
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:10,719
and he just wanted
to hear his songs...

1094
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:14,229
not translated.

1095
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:17,459
He was incredibly frustrated
with the fact that he couldn't find

1096
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:20,559
anybody at a record company
who would support his music.

1097
01:07:20,636 --> 01:07:24,936
I mean, he went over to England
to do remixes with Geoff Emerick,

1098
01:07:25,007 --> 01:07:28,204
to get his music
in line with something

1099
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:30,768
that someone would appreciate,

1100
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:33,906
and he wasn't achieving
that to the least.

1101
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:37,851
" I walk the streets. "

1102
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:43,316
" And all alone... "

1103
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:47,590
Chris came to a very
settled faith in Jesus Christ

1104
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:49,096
as Lord and Savior.

1105
01:07:49,165 --> 01:07:52,726
It made a big difference in his life

1106
01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:54,770
and it made a big difference in mine.

1107
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:04,004
Music was still
his great gift and he knew it,

1108
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,674
and he wanted to do
whatever he could with it.

1109
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:09,183
But nothing topped God.

1110
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:10,946
For him to be singing a song about.

1111
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:13,511
"You got to give
your life to Jesus,"

1112
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:15,489
you know, it was like,
"God, Chris, that's"...

1113
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:18,618
I never knew he had
that element, you know.

1114
01:08:18,694 --> 01:08:21,686
It wasn't just as easy
with Chris as to say,

1115
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:26,258
"I've been born again"
and to live that life,

1116
01:08:26,335 --> 01:08:29,270
to accept it completely,
you know.

1117
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:32,865
I think there were things
that troubled him... not about religion,

1118
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:36,105
but about other aspects
of his life that didn't...

1119
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:39,773
like the two didn't really
balance each other out

1120
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:42,010
or complement each other.

1121
01:08:45,354 --> 01:08:51,156
" You should've given
your love to Jesus "

1122
01:08:51,227 --> 01:08:54,287
" it couldn't do you no harm..."

1123
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:57,196
He once told me,
" You should do drugs.

1124
01:08:57,266 --> 01:08:59,791
It takes away your sexual urges. "

1125
01:08:59,869 --> 01:09:03,566
I have a feeling that drugs
and then religion, obviously...

1126
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:11,572
had a way of keeping
any of that at bay.

1127
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,808
There was a part of Chris that, to me,

1128
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:17,375
seemed like
a highly-combustionable blend

1129
01:09:17,453 --> 01:09:21,014
of whatever substances
he was in-taking,

1130
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:24,890
whatever was his baggage
concerning his sexuality

1131
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,190
and born-again Christianity.

1132
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:30,755
It was like
all of this stuff mashing around.

1133
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,696
I heard about it.

1134
01:09:33,769 --> 01:09:37,705
I heard about a lot of that stuff.
Thinking back on it,

1135
01:09:37,773 --> 01:09:41,174
I could see that he was searching,

1136
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:43,507
which could explain the religion thing.

1137
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:46,377
It could explain experimentation
of one kind or another.

1138
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:50,214
It could explain drugs,
you know, travel,

1139
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:52,481
whatever, you know.
You're searching, you know.

1140
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:02,690
I was sent out on an assignment

1141
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:06,428
from 'the Village Voice"
and I met Alex the day

1142
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:11,405
he had just moved
to New York from Memphis.

1143
01:10:14,443 --> 01:10:18,140
As I got to the place,
Lesa was leaving

1144
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:21,615
and he started crying on my shoulder.

1145
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:24,380
This is from the first session we did.

1146
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:28,082
He was living up in Little lndia then.

1147
01:10:28,157 --> 01:10:31,752
He was very sweet,
very Southern.

1148
01:10:31,827 --> 01:10:33,624
He had a copy of "Radio City"

1149
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:38,463
and "Here's some of my music," you know.

1150
01:10:38,534 --> 01:10:44,063
Despite claims to the contrary,
he knew he'd done something.

1151
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:46,300
A guy named Terry Ork,
Ork Records, said,

1152
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:48,639
"Well, we've got this project.
Alex Chilton might be coming up.."

1153
01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:50,338
This is maybe my second week
in New York.

1154
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:53,643
He called in and said,
"Do you want to play with Alex?

1155
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:55,206
Could you put together a band?"

1156
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,776
Nobody knew what would happen,

1157
01:10:57,853 --> 01:11:01,789
but they knew that television had gotten
a real record deal with a real label

1158
01:11:01,857 --> 01:11:04,985
and it seemed like,
you know, " This is kind of crazy."

1159
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,857
I've only been here a couple of weeks.

1160
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:14,669
" Here's a little thing
that's gonna please ya. "

1161
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:18,070
" Just a little town down
in lndonesia, Bangkok... "

1162
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:21,772
I asked him at one point,

1163
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:24,472
"Why don't you write more stuff
like you did with Big Star?"

1164
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:27,447
And he just said, "I can't.
I can't write that way anymore."

1165
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:29,450
He realized he could
write a different kind of lyric.

1166
01:11:29,518 --> 01:11:31,145
He could write a lyric like "Bangkok"

1167
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:34,781
that was a witty Algonquin
Round Table kind of thing.

1168
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:39,385
And I don't think that that
unattainable muse mechanism

1169
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:42,828
was the way he wrote songs
anymore after Lesa.

1170
01:11:42,898 --> 01:11:44,559
Punk gave him an outlet

1171
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:48,228
where he could get
a lot of his anger out

1172
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:51,671
from the debacle of Big Star

1173
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:54,834
being totally ignored.
And I mean, that would create

1174
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:57,845
a certain amount
of bitterness and anger,

1175
01:11:57,913 --> 01:12:02,043
and I mean it was a nice place
for that to fit in.

1176
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:03,808
You like Punk Rock?

1177
01:12:03,886 --> 01:12:05,012
Not in the least.

1178
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:08,420
Well, never mind the Sex Pistols then,
Byron, here come The Cramps.

1179
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,720
Charles Raiteri
reports on the Rock and Roll

1180
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:12,658
werewolves
from the Black Lagoon.

1181
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:19,925
Alex saw the Cramps at CBGB's

1182
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:22,766
and came back talking
about it the next day and he loved it.

1183
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:26,934
It was, you know, Memphis
but New York at the same time.

1184
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:30,206
" I tuned you inside my radio,
like this!"

1185
01:12:33,248 --> 01:12:36,513
I had heard
that it was a performance-art project

1186
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:39,577
that had gotten a following as a band.

1187
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:42,385
They were ghouls,
you know, deliberately ghouls.

1188
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:47,026
When The Cramps
came here in September of "77",

1189
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:50,190
Lux and lvy and Nick,
I mean, they stopped traffic.

1190
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:52,028
People would go...

1191
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:53,796
"What the fuck are you?"

1192
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:01,239
For me, that was Memphis
Rock and Roll 20 years later.

1193
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:04,404
Not Rock music,
not retro-rockabilly,

1194
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:08,314
not... not Punk Rock.
That was Rock and Roll.

1195
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:10,875
Memphian Alex Chilton,
well-known in the Punk world,

1196
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:13,615
is producing The Cramps album,
not from this old board.

1197
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:16,419
This is the board which first recorded
the man many consider to be

1198
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:19,120
the first rockabilly punk,
Elvis Presley.

1199
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:21,162
Well, yeah, I think it makes them
feel good to be in Memphis,

1200
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:24,791
you know,
down here where all the music

1201
01:13:24,867 --> 01:13:27,427
that they have collected for so long

1202
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:29,300
and like so much came from.

1203
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:41,509
I just love those up-tempo waltzes.

1204
01:13:56,532 --> 01:13:57,965
" Rock hard... "

1205
01:13:58,033 --> 01:14:01,093
You know, there were people
in several other areas

1206
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:05,470
reaching for Punk Rock
and reaching for a new,

1207
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:08,806
you know, aggressive,
cutting-edge denial of the past.

1208
01:14:08,877 --> 01:14:10,139
We were too.

1209
01:14:10,212 --> 01:14:12,703
" Rock hard, the ripples... "

1210
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:15,341
But yeah, Punk Rock was
different in Memphis

1211
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:17,942
than it was other places.

1212
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:19,715
" Lonely days are gone. "

1213
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:21,346
" I'm-a going home. "

1214
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:24,483
" My baby just-a wrote me a letter... "

1215
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,221
it was
at the Beale Street Blues Festival

1216
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:29,458
that Memphis first realized
it had a Punk in its midst.

1217
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:32,625
Alex, are you being punkish
on stage? Is that what it is?

1218
01:14:32,701 --> 01:14:34,191
Yeah.

1219
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:35,634
" Rock hard. "

1220
01:14:35,704 --> 01:14:37,638
" Rock hard. "

1221
01:14:37,706 --> 01:14:38,968
" The ripples. "

1222
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:40,838
" Rock hard. "

1223
01:14:40,909 --> 01:14:42,137
" The nipples. "

1224
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:45,009
" Rock hard, purple... "

1225
01:15:06,068 --> 01:15:07,558
I think the Memphis Pilgrimage

1226
01:15:07,636 --> 01:15:10,036
was just the natural thing
to do for us at that time,

1227
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:12,335
because I had met Alex in New York

1228
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:14,170
and then Chris Stamey,
of course, was playing with him.

1229
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:16,283
It was summer.
We were like, "Let's do something."

1230
01:15:16,311 --> 01:15:18,506
And the thing we're gonna do is
instead of going to the beach,

1231
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:20,571
we're gonna go to Memphis.

1232
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:28,214
We also had the idea
that we were going to meet Chris Bell.

1233
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:31,054
We were going to try to.
We just were curious about him.

1234
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:32,593
He was more mysterious,

1235
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:35,960
"cause, you know, he sort of disappears
from the Big Star story early on."

1236
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:38,795
It was kind of like hanging out
with the Beatles for us,

1237
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:41,563
because those records to us were
as good as any records on earth.

1238
01:15:41,637 --> 01:15:44,231
I guess we were probably like...
every year got a little more

1239
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:47,070
into them in a way, like realizing
just how good they were,

1240
01:15:47,142 --> 01:15:49,576
and thinking more and more about
how they did them and stuff.

1241
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:52,940
And then, of course,
this picture on the back is great,

1242
01:15:52,948 --> 01:15:55,473
because they look pretty cool and look
like they're having a good time.

1243
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:58,577
And you have to love Jody's jacket.
You cannot beat that.

1244
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:07,455
We had a bit of information about

1245
01:16:07,529 --> 01:16:09,997
which Danver's restaurant
Chris Bell was working at

1246
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:11,345
and found it and went out there.

1247
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:14,801
Well, Alex told us where to find Chris.

1248
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:16,497
- Did he?
- Yeah, he said,

1249
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:18,972
"Yeah, he works
out at this Danver's in..."

1250
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:20,406
Germantown or something?

1251
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:22,943
Germantown or whatever it was,
the suburb.

1252
01:16:23,011 --> 01:16:24,501
And sure enough,
we went out there

1253
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:27,344
and he was wearing
the little two-corner paper hat

1254
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:31,750
and... didn't seem
particularly glad to see us.

1255
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:33,344
- Well, we passed a note back...
- He was rambunctious.

1256
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:34,946
- ...through the person at the counter.
- Right.

1257
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:37,184
And he came out looking
completely bamboozled like,

1258
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:39,625
- "You want to see me?"
- Yeah.

1259
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:48,761
Alex had invited us
to go stop into the studio,

1260
01:16:48,837 --> 01:16:50,964
"cause he was having
a listening session.

1261
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:54,202
He was making an album
that became "Like Flies on Sherbet,"

1262
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:57,712
and we kept bugging Chris Bell,

1263
01:16:57,779 --> 01:16:59,974
who was really reluctant to go.

1264
01:17:00,048 --> 01:17:02,107
He really did not want to go.

1265
01:17:02,184 --> 01:17:03,845
And we finally bugged him

1266
01:17:03,919 --> 01:17:06,513
long enough that he agreed to go.

1267
01:17:06,588 --> 01:17:10,285
And Chris Bell sat in the corner
and was really, really uptight

1268
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:12,850
and Alex just kind of said hi to him.

1269
01:17:12,928 --> 01:17:14,793
But we did wind up staying there

1270
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:16,888
right after he beat it out of there.

1271
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:19,729
Oh, yeah yeah.
Chris left as quick as he could.

1272
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:22,167
Yeah, it struck me... those two probably
hadn't seen each other in a long time.

1273
01:17:22,237 --> 01:17:24,899
And it was perfectly cordial,
but it wasn't exactly comfortable.

1274
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:27,703
- And so we were the enzyme there.
- Yeah.

1275
01:17:27,776 --> 01:17:30,497
And I felt a little bad about it later
because I hate to have thought

1276
01:17:30,545 --> 01:17:33,036
that Chris thought we just wanted,
you know, to get to Alex,

1277
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:34,742
because Alex was sort of the...

1278
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:36,807
I mean, there was a little bit
of the Lennon/McCartney thing.

1279
01:17:36,885 --> 01:17:39,683
There was a magnetism that Alex
always had and I'm sure he felt that.

1280
01:17:39,755 --> 01:17:44,055
" Oh, little foo. "

1281
01:17:44,126 --> 01:17:48,153
" Are you learning anything in school? "

1282
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:50,425
" Maybe you might... "

1283
01:18:09,918 --> 01:18:12,113
Oh! Oh! Oh...

1284
01:18:13,789 --> 01:18:15,950
This is anti-music, is that right?

1285
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:18,720
This is an anti-musical environment.
We'd like to do...

1286
01:18:18,794 --> 01:18:21,058
The Panther Burns would like
to do one more tune.

1287
01:18:21,129 --> 01:18:22,858
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1288
01:18:22,931 --> 01:18:26,230
That may be the worst sound
I've ever heard come out on television.

1289
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:28,360
- The loveliest pictures...
- Thank you very much.

1290
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:30,962
That's what
you want though, I'm assuming.

1291
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:33,234
Well, the best of the worst.

1292
01:18:33,308 --> 01:18:35,742
- It's just art and ambience.
- You're really very bitter, aren't you?

1293
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:38,905
I'm not bitter about anything.
I get exhilarated by this kind of music.

1294
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:41,574
Why don't you introduce
the band members to us?

1295
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,982
This band is Panther Burn.

1296
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:48,955
And we have on synthesizer, Eric Hill,

1297
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:51,720
Ross Johnson on drums,

1298
01:18:51,793 --> 01:18:53,886
Rick lvy on trumpet,

1299
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:56,021
Axel Chitlin on lead guitar...

1300
01:18:58,033 --> 01:19:02,470
and Gustavo...
Gustavo Falco on guitar and vocals.

1301
01:19:02,537 --> 01:19:05,404
We'd like to do one more tune,
which is a rock and roll tango...

1302
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:08,068
Gustavo,
we're not quite ready for it, okay?

1303
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:09,770
- Okay.
- We're gonna take another break

1304
01:19:09,845 --> 01:19:12,805
here on "Straight Talk" and we'll be
back to the studio in just a moment.

1305
01:19:14,983 --> 01:19:16,507
There was Muddy Waters,

1306
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:19,019
there was the Rolling Stones,
now there's...

1307
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:21,146
the Panther Burns.

1308
01:19:21,223 --> 01:19:23,123
And...

1309
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:24,590
Oh, yeah.

1310
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:28,060
I mean,
we're obviously underground.

1311
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:31,757
" Home of the brave,
land of the free... "

1312
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:34,131
it was art damage.

1313
01:19:34,202 --> 01:19:40,004
That was the concept...
to perform, entertain, and to provoke.

1314
01:19:53,755 --> 01:19:57,316
I thought that part
of Rock and Roll was gone.

1315
01:19:57,392 --> 01:19:59,519
I didn't think really
you could do anything

1316
01:19:59,594 --> 01:20:03,690
that would truly be offensive.
And sure enough, you could.

1317
01:20:03,765 --> 01:20:05,494
You still could.

1318
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:33,188
I felt he had consciously
distanced himself from Big Star.

1319
01:20:33,261 --> 01:20:35,092
There was this syndrome where...

1320
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:39,193
when Alex is involved,
you create something

1321
01:20:39,267 --> 01:20:42,361
that's beautiful,

1322
01:20:42,437 --> 01:20:45,804
and then the next phase
is to destroy it.

1323
01:20:48,076 --> 01:20:50,874
So Alex told me
that Chris Bell had this crazy song

1324
01:20:50,946 --> 01:20:53,346
and told me he had mixed it
with Geoff Emerick

1325
01:20:53,415 --> 01:20:55,212
and I started hearing
something about it.

1326
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:56,443
I don't know if I got much of it.

1327
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:59,043
It was mainly just Alex said, "it's a
great song. You ought to put it out."

1328
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:02,886
Alex was just sitting here
and he said it goes like this,

1329
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:05,392
" Every night I tell myself
I am the cosmos,

1330
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:09,123
I am the wind,
but that don't get you back again."

1331
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:11,529
And then Alex just, like, laughed.

1332
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,967
And he just thought
that was so much like Chris.

1333
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:21,100
Like Chris had written
the perfect Chris Bell line.

1334
01:21:22,143 --> 01:21:24,236
"I Am the Cosmos" would never
have come out without Alex

1335
01:21:24,312 --> 01:21:26,974
wanting me to put it out.
It was the song, you know.

1336
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:31,144
It was the perfect anthem to him.
It was a big deal to Chris.

1337
01:21:33,355 --> 01:21:36,552
" Every night I tell myself. "

1338
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:40,652
" I am the cosmos. "

1339
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:43,960
" I am the wind. "

1340
01:21:46,201 --> 01:21:50,194
" But that don't get you back again. "

1341
01:21:53,141 --> 01:21:58,101
" Just when I was
starting to feel okay. "

1342
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:03,046
" You're on the phone. "

1343
01:22:05,387 --> 01:22:10,290
" I never wanna be alone..."

1344
01:22:10,358 --> 01:22:12,189
I remember being at Shoe,

1345
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:14,956
a few hours
after Cosmos was mixed,

1346
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:20,332
and I thought, "Oh my God,
that's where Big Star went."

1347
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:23,701
This just picked up where...

1348
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:26,468
what I loved in "Radio City,"

1349
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:28,975
and this just went... here.

1350
01:22:45,393 --> 01:22:49,124
It was somewhat overwhelming
to me, you know.

1351
01:22:49,197 --> 01:22:51,859
It was really beautiful,

1352
01:22:51,933 --> 01:22:55,130
but I was so distracted
by the musical aspect of it.

1353
01:22:55,203 --> 01:22:57,637
I didn't really get the lyrics
until probably

1354
01:22:57,706 --> 01:23:00,072
the second or third time
that I listened to it.

1355
01:23:00,141 --> 01:23:04,202
"I Am the Cosmos"... that's...
there's a brilliant song for you.

1356
01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:08,648
Somebody who's just so full of ego

1357
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:11,982
and so full of himself, he just thinks
he can control the universe,

1358
01:23:12,053 --> 01:23:15,511
but nothing he can do
can get this one thing

1359
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:17,387
that he's lost back to him.

1360
01:23:17,459 --> 01:23:23,523
" Want you too much
to say no, no. "

1361
01:23:23,598 --> 01:23:27,398
" Yeah yeah yeah... "

1362
01:23:30,472 --> 01:23:33,168
I put it out on my label
and sent out review copies,

1363
01:23:33,241 --> 01:23:35,402
and I always felt like
the world changed a little bit,

1364
01:23:35,477 --> 01:23:37,775
maybe it's "cause the song
is called "I Am The Cosmos.".

1365
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:41,782
But never sold many copies, but it made
Chris Bell very happy, apparently.

1366
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:45,809
" I can't confide. "

1367
01:23:47,322 --> 01:23:48,619
" Don't know what's going... "

1368
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:51,682
I never heard "I Am the Cosmos"
while he was alive.

1369
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:52,749
Yeah.

1370
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:56,694
So, you know, but I can...

1371
01:23:56,765 --> 01:23:59,893
I can just speculate on that.

1372
01:23:59,968 --> 01:24:02,732
- Go ahead.
- Well, I mean, I can...

1373
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:11,903
I don't really have much
I can say about that.

1374
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:15,746
I mean, I can...
I can sense his pain.

1375
01:24:19,354 --> 01:24:21,822
That's song's painful
for me to listen to.

1376
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:27,623
" I'd really like to see you again. "

1377
01:24:30,031 --> 01:24:33,694
" I really wanna see you again. "

1378
01:24:36,037 --> 01:24:39,632
" I'd really like to see you again. "

1379
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:45,346
" I really wanna see you again..."

1380
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:48,242
Records I like have

1381
01:24:48,316 --> 01:24:51,649
a lot of Ying and a lot of Yang.
You know, I like for things to be...

1382
01:24:53,354 --> 01:24:55,515
you know, kind of the way
batteries work.

1383
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:58,354
I like the idea
that "Cosmos" would be

1384
01:24:58,426 --> 01:25:00,860
on one side
and 'sister" would be on the other.

1385
01:25:11,272 --> 01:25:15,299
" They say my love for you ain't real. "

1386
01:25:20,348 --> 01:25:24,512
" But you don't know
how real it feels... "

1387
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:29,178
Chris's voice...
he's pushing against his limitations.

1388
01:25:29,257 --> 01:25:32,021
And sometimes he sounds like

1389
01:25:32,093 --> 01:25:35,494
he is one breath away
from evaporating

1390
01:25:35,563 --> 01:25:37,394
in front of my ears.

1391
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:40,761
" Hold you. "

1392
01:25:46,474 --> 01:25:50,934
" Your sister says that I'm no good. "

1393
01:25:55,583 --> 01:26:00,680
" I'd reassure her if I could..."

1394
01:26:00,755 --> 01:26:02,746
Alex's genius happened

1395
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:07,318
because he could
so carelessly throw things away.

1396
01:26:07,395 --> 01:26:09,192
And I can tell that Alex is probably

1397
01:26:09,264 --> 01:26:11,892
just tossing his lines off,

1398
01:26:11,966 --> 01:26:13,934
but there's something about the way

1399
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:16,732
that the two of them
sing together on that take.

1400
01:26:16,804 --> 01:26:19,705
Half the time I listen to it,
I'm reduced to tears.

1401
01:26:21,276 --> 01:26:25,372
" Plans fail every day. "

1402
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:32,948
" I want to hear you say "

1403
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:42,953
- " Your love won't be leaving "
- " Run run, run run "

1404
01:26:44,933 --> 01:26:51,668
- " Your eyes ain't deceiving"
- " Run run, run run. "

1405
01:26:54,275 --> 01:26:58,473
" Fears will soon fade away. "

1406
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:06,009
" Smile now, don't be afraid. "

1407
01:27:09,657 --> 01:27:16,495
" All I want to do is to spend
some time with you. "

1408
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:20,898
" So I can hold you, hold you..."

1409
01:27:20,969 --> 01:27:23,836
I used to have this terrible
premonition that Chris

1410
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:27,773
would never grow old, because he had
nowhere to go, you know.

1411
01:27:28,977 --> 01:27:30,444
He had no way out

1412
01:27:30,511 --> 01:27:32,672
and I just couldn't project him

1413
01:27:32,747 --> 01:27:35,079
into growing to the age I am now

1414
01:27:35,149 --> 01:27:37,709
because he had just no way
to survive into the future.

1415
01:27:38,853 --> 01:27:40,753
It was like a shooting star.

1416
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:42,790
It was just something that was...

1417
01:27:42,857 --> 01:27:46,258
it had its time and it was gonna...
 out.

1418
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:49,421
But sure as hell didn't
make it any easier when it happened.

1419
01:27:49,497 --> 01:27:50,964
" Spend some time with you. "

1420
01:27:51,866 --> 01:27:54,300
" So I can hold you. "

1421
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:10,314
We would just talk,

1422
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:13,650
and it was usually me saying
"Now don't worry about this"

1423
01:28:13,721 --> 01:28:16,315
or "Why don't you go in this direction

1424
01:28:16,391 --> 01:28:20,691
and do something,"
like I said, "more normal?"

1425
01:28:20,762 --> 01:28:23,094
Just because I just saw him...

1426
01:28:24,365 --> 01:28:27,300
frustrated and unhappy, I felt like.

1427
01:28:27,368 --> 01:28:31,464
And we'd have some conversations
about religion.

1428
01:28:31,539 --> 01:28:33,063
And I know y'all did too.

1429
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:37,510
I mean, Christopher was
a very spiritual person and...

1430
01:28:39,747 --> 01:28:42,045
talking to me
about going to heaven.

1431
01:28:42,116 --> 01:28:47,452
And saying, "By the grace of God,
that's the only way you go to heaven."

1432
01:29:20,088 --> 01:29:23,114
The night that Chris died, I was in bed.

1433
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:26,718
All of a sudden,
I just sat bolt upright in the bed.

1434
01:29:26,794 --> 01:29:30,127
I had this overwhelming feeling
that somebody was in the room.

1435
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:33,895
You know, I expected to encounter
a burglar or something.

1436
01:29:33,968 --> 01:29:37,631
And there was nobody
in there at all.

1437
01:29:37,705 --> 01:29:41,402
And, you know,
I looked over at the clock

1438
01:29:41,476 --> 01:29:46,413
and as I recall 35,

1439
01:29:46,481 --> 01:29:50,781
which was the exact time
of Chris's crash.

1440
01:29:50,852 --> 01:29:54,151
And I've never had anything like that
happen in my life before or since.

1441
01:29:55,356 --> 01:29:58,120
I feel almost guilty sometimes

1442
01:29:58,192 --> 01:30:00,217
talking about the music part of it,

1443
01:30:00,294 --> 01:30:02,592
because it wasn't my thing.

1444
01:30:02,663 --> 01:30:03,960
I can't help it.

1445
01:30:04,031 --> 01:30:07,831
I kind of resent it,
"cause it... it makes me sad."

1446
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:09,631
Mmm.

1447
01:30:09,704 --> 01:30:13,834
I mean,
I'm happy for him, but I...

1448
01:30:16,677 --> 01:30:18,838
You'd rather have him
instead of having

1449
01:30:18,913 --> 01:30:21,973
the music out there.
I know, sure.

1450
01:30:22,049 --> 01:30:26,179
" But I'll try. "

1451
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:30,156
" Again... "

1452
01:30:30,224 --> 01:30:33,591
I had heard, one night on the radio,

1453
01:30:33,661 --> 01:30:36,095
somebody talking about all of these

1454
01:30:36,164 --> 01:30:39,691
different Rock and Roll people,
who died at the age of 27.

1455
01:30:39,767 --> 01:30:42,964
And, you know,
there was Hendrix I believe,

1456
01:30:43,037 --> 01:30:44,595
there was Joplin.

1457
01:30:44,672 --> 01:30:47,607
You know, just a long string
of people that died at 27

1458
01:30:47,675 --> 01:30:50,610
and they included
Chris Bell of Big Star.

1459
01:30:50,678 --> 01:30:55,206
You know, it's like he just
kind of walked into a template

1460
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:57,979
for a Rock and Roll legend
in a lot of ways.

1461
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:32,518
If you look at what happened
with the Big Star records in 1976,

1462
01:31:32,587 --> 01:31:35,181
I would have told you
nothing will ever happen

1463
01:31:35,256 --> 01:31:36,689
further about it.

1464
01:31:41,095 --> 01:31:42,653
The first rumblings

1465
01:31:42,730 --> 01:31:44,755
that we heard
that something was up

1466
01:31:44,832 --> 01:31:47,767
and that there was
this cult following building,

1467
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:50,030
were not coming
from the United States.

1468
01:31:50,104 --> 01:31:52,163
They were coming
from the UK and Europe.

1469
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:54,538
" We did last week. "

1470
01:31:55,676 --> 01:31:59,772
" Not a thing to do. "

1471
01:31:59,847 --> 01:32:05,217
" But talk to you... "

1472
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:10,051
I spent some time in London in 1978,

1473
01:32:10,124 --> 01:32:12,718
I'd pick up a "Melody Maker,"
or a "New Musical Express,"

1474
01:32:12,793 --> 01:32:15,921
and there would invariably
be something about Big Star...

1475
01:32:15,997 --> 01:32:18,795
whether it was just
a mention of Alex,

1476
01:32:18,866 --> 01:32:22,529
or whether it was a band
in an album review

1477
01:32:22,603 --> 01:32:24,468
and they compared them to Big Star,

1478
01:32:24,539 --> 01:32:28,100
or whether it was
somebody back in the classifieds

1479
01:32:28,175 --> 01:32:30,302
looking for someplace

1480
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:32,403
to buy a Big Star album.

1481
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:40,914
Then I had
somebody call me up and say,

1482
01:32:40,988 --> 01:32:43,786
" Did you know that EMI had leased

1483
01:32:43,858 --> 01:32:46,224
"#1 Record" and "Radio City"

1484
01:32:46,294 --> 01:32:49,457
and that they had put it out
in England as a double gatefold vinyl?

1485
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:58,228
Particularly in Scotland,

1486
01:32:58,306 --> 01:33:00,331
it's like a nuclear bomb hit.

1487
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:02,501
And, you know, they were
such an influential band

1488
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:04,477
to so many groups.

1489
01:33:06,314 --> 01:33:07,679
I was sort of hanging out with the guys

1490
01:33:07,748 --> 01:33:10,342
from Primal Scream and Alan McGee
and people from the Glasgow scene.

1491
01:33:10,418 --> 01:33:13,876
They were all fans
of the Big Star albums.

1492
01:33:16,324 --> 01:33:18,588
I think kind of in the "90s, it's like,

1493
01:33:18,659 --> 01:33:20,854
it was established
that Big Star were great.

1494
01:33:20,928 --> 01:33:22,486
They'd be one of those kinds of bands...
like someone would say,

1495
01:33:22,563 --> 01:33:24,121
"You ever heard Big Star?"

1496
01:33:24,198 --> 01:33:26,257
And by then,
you've heard like 20 records

1497
01:33:26,334 --> 01:33:28,825
that are actually
influenced by Big Star.

1498
01:33:28,903 --> 01:33:30,336
Uh, this next song is by

1499
01:33:30,404 --> 01:33:33,134
a mutual favorite band
of ours, Big Star.

1500
01:33:35,042 --> 01:33:37,135
" Hanging out... "

1501
01:33:38,779 --> 01:33:40,610
it's a cult hit all around the world,

1502
01:33:40,681 --> 01:33:42,706
you know, some people have
never heard of Cheap Trick.

1503
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:46,275
They don't even know it's us. They just
know... they just know it's a great song.

1504
01:33:46,354 --> 01:33:47,946
When we do play "In the Street,"

1505
01:33:48,022 --> 01:33:49,887
it's a crowd pleaser.

1506
01:33:49,957 --> 01:33:53,518
" Not a thing to do... "

1507
01:33:53,594 --> 01:33:55,960
Yeah, I'm not sure about
when I felt like there was

1508
01:33:56,030 --> 01:33:58,498
a Big Star resurgence,
but it might have just been like

1509
01:33:58,566 --> 01:34:01,865
when maybe the REM guys
talked about them.

1510
01:34:01,936 --> 01:34:04,666
It seems like maybe Pete Buck
was listening to them or something.

1511
01:34:04,739 --> 01:34:06,730
I mean,
he was a real record guy.

1512
01:34:06,807 --> 01:34:08,331
You know,
and then it seems like

1513
01:34:08,409 --> 01:34:10,843
you started hearing
Paul Westerberg talk about them.

1514
01:34:12,446 --> 01:34:15,574
Alex was opening for the Replacements

1515
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:19,177
and I went over to Alex,
I said, "Look, Paul loves you."

1516
01:34:19,253 --> 01:34:22,814
I said, "Please go back
and introduce yourself to him."

1517
01:34:22,890 --> 01:34:26,189
And as it wound up,
Alex produced a demo

1518
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:28,751
that got them signed to Sire.

1519
01:34:28,829 --> 01:34:30,660
We want people to know who Alex is.

1520
01:34:30,731 --> 01:34:33,063
Who don't... never heard of Big Star.

1521
01:34:33,134 --> 01:34:34,829
And it's our way of, like...

1522
01:34:34,902 --> 01:34:36,392
you know,
he doesn't need our help.

1523
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:38,062
He doesn't want our help,
but damn it,

1524
01:34:38,139 --> 01:34:40,403
he's gonna get it,
whether he likes it or not.

1525
01:34:40,474 --> 01:34:43,841
" Children by the million
sing for Alex Chilton... "

1526
01:34:43,911 --> 01:34:46,106
He was always totally grumpy
about his past,

1527
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:48,080
which is in a way to his credit.

1528
01:34:48,149 --> 01:34:50,845
I mean, in some ways
I got tired of hearing him

1529
01:34:50,918 --> 01:34:54,251
talk about how terrible Big Star was.
I'm like, "No, they weren't. Shut up.

1530
01:34:54,321 --> 01:34:56,448
Isn't it long enough
now that you can sort of,

1531
01:34:56,524 --> 01:34:58,856
like, recognize that
a lot of us like this stuff,

1532
01:34:58,926 --> 01:35:01,292
even if we're not totally
cool or whatever?"

1533
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:03,227
But I can also
really appreciate the fact

1534
01:35:03,297 --> 01:35:06,232
that he's really got
that sort of burning artistic,

1535
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:09,269
unsettled thing in his soul
that really made him mean it.

1536
01:35:09,537 --> 01:35:11,596
I used to live up-river in Memphis.

1537
01:35:11,672 --> 01:35:15,108
And, uh, Memphis has got...

1538
01:35:15,176 --> 01:35:18,077
well, it hasn't got a lot of the things
that New Orleans has.

1539
01:35:18,145 --> 01:35:20,238
I feel a lot freer here.

1540
01:35:24,518 --> 01:35:29,114
You know, he made his own way
and escaped his many incarnations,

1541
01:35:29,190 --> 01:35:33,092
which I also find really fascinating.
You know, he came out of the Box Tops

1542
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:35,890
and he could have been
that gravel-voiced singer forever,

1543
01:35:35,963 --> 01:35:38,227
but he made a new start.

1544
01:35:38,299 --> 01:35:40,995
For years and years he toured
with, like, a rhythm section and...

1545
01:35:41,068 --> 01:35:43,969
- you know, playing Volare.
- Yeah.

1546
01:35:44,038 --> 01:35:46,029
Volare!

1547
01:35:47,208 --> 01:35:49,403
I know these are complex things
with people,

1548
01:35:49,477 --> 01:35:52,446
but I didn't think
it served him that well

1549
01:35:52,513 --> 01:35:54,606
to always be turning his back
on some of this stuff.

1550
01:35:54,682 --> 01:35:57,276
And in his attitude
towards his own career,

1551
01:35:57,351 --> 01:36:00,548
I think there was a certain kind
of self-destructiveness on that level.

1552
01:36:01,589 --> 01:36:04,149
" I love. "

1553
01:36:05,226 --> 01:36:06,784
" The walking dead. "

1554
01:36:06,861 --> 01:36:10,797
" No, I really do..."

1555
01:36:10,865 --> 01:36:13,299
I think he went
through an evolution

1556
01:36:13,367 --> 01:36:15,267
to get to where he wanted to be.

1557
01:36:15,336 --> 01:36:17,634
It isn't necessarily
where everybody wanted him to stay.

1558
01:36:17,705 --> 01:36:20,265
I think there are people who would have
rather him still be in the Box Tops,

1559
01:36:20,341 --> 01:36:21,968
and people would rather him
still be in Big Star.

1560
01:36:22,042 --> 01:36:24,840
But, you know, he was
a real musician and a real artist.

1561
01:36:33,954 --> 01:36:35,683
Morning. Do you mind signing?

1562
01:36:35,756 --> 01:36:36,984
- No.
- Thanks, man.

1563
01:36:39,126 --> 01:36:42,061
You keep buying 'em,
I'll keep signing 'em.

1564
01:36:42,129 --> 01:36:44,529
Alex was always difficult.

1565
01:36:44,598 --> 01:36:46,964
- Was that at TGI Fridays?
- Yes.

1566
01:36:47,034 --> 01:36:50,697
For instance,
when he reformed Big Star in "93",

1567
01:36:50,771 --> 01:36:53,205
anyone that knew him was shocked

1568
01:36:53,274 --> 01:36:56,402
that he did that
because people asked him to.

1569
01:36:56,477 --> 01:36:58,672
And if you ask
Alex to do something,

1570
01:36:58,746 --> 01:37:03,740
you can bet he's gonna say,
you know, no.

1571
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:07,584
Um, I had... I thought it was a hoax.

1572
01:37:07,655 --> 01:37:10,180
They'll be playing tomorrow night
at the House of Blues right here in L.A.

1573
01:37:10,257 --> 01:37:11,884
Please welcome Big Star.

1574
01:37:20,568 --> 01:37:21,899
" Hanging out. "

1575
01:37:24,171 --> 01:37:25,399
" Down the street... "

1576
01:37:28,108 --> 01:37:30,235
" Ain't no one. "

1577
01:37:30,311 --> 01:37:33,610
" Going to turn me "round... "

1578
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:35,842
When Big Star reformed

1579
01:37:35,916 --> 01:37:39,249
I felt like that was
a gratifying payback

1580
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:43,017
to get in touch with the many,
many, many thousands of people

1581
01:37:43,090 --> 01:37:46,617
that were touched by the music
that were invisible to them,

1582
01:37:46,694 --> 01:37:49,720
you know, who were
finding Big Star records

1583
01:37:49,797 --> 01:37:52,231
and CD's in little record shops.

1584
01:37:55,035 --> 01:37:56,730
Thank you, Jody.

1585
01:37:56,804 --> 01:37:58,135
Not bad. Not bad.

1586
01:37:58,205 --> 01:38:00,400
I am so grateful
that Jody is on the planet.

1587
01:38:00,474 --> 01:38:02,908
In some ways, you know,
I think he carries the heart

1588
01:38:02,977 --> 01:38:05,639
and soul of what we love
about Big Star.

1589
01:38:07,715 --> 01:38:09,910
I think he was always true to something

1590
01:38:09,984 --> 01:38:12,919
that was true to him.

1591
01:38:12,987 --> 01:38:14,181
It was essential to him.

1592
01:38:15,322 --> 01:38:19,486
" I thought I'd sit
and write this song. "

1593
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:21,585
" Just for you... "

1594
01:38:24,632 --> 01:38:27,396
Being in the band
with Alex and Jon and Ken...

1595
01:38:27,468 --> 01:38:29,800
Wow, I've got this amazing seat

1596
01:38:29,870 --> 01:38:33,567
to these great performances
by the three of them.

1597
01:38:33,641 --> 01:38:35,939
So it's more about the three of them

1598
01:38:36,010 --> 01:38:39,070
and I'm kind of
a spectator back there.

1599
01:38:39,146 --> 01:38:43,583
There's such tremendous joy
in playing with Alex.

1600
01:38:43,651 --> 01:38:47,849
You know, there would be
this smile on his face that...

1601
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:49,822
that, umm...

1602
01:38:51,225 --> 01:38:53,159
maybe it was a spontaneous smile

1603
01:38:53,227 --> 01:38:55,320
and maybe he realized
that he was smiling

1604
01:38:55,396 --> 01:38:57,956
and so maybe he stopped.

1605
01:38:58,032 --> 01:39:00,592
But... Alex...

1606
01:39:00,668 --> 01:39:03,193
I've never known Alex to do anything

1607
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:05,329
he didn't like to do,

1608
01:39:05,406 --> 01:39:08,807
so he must have liked playing

1609
01:39:08,876 --> 01:39:12,209
and performing on stage
and playing that music.

1610
01:39:15,182 --> 01:39:17,844
The gentleman
is recognized for one minute.

1611
01:39:18,018 --> 01:39:19,451
Thank you, Madam Speaker.

1612
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:22,353
Today I come before you
with a heavy heart

1613
01:39:22,423 --> 01:39:25,483
for a friend of mine and a great friend
of music in the world...

1614
01:39:25,559 --> 01:39:27,493
in particular from my hometown
of Memphis, Tennessee...

1615
01:39:27,561 --> 01:39:30,962
passed away last night, Alex Chilton.

1616
01:39:31,031 --> 01:39:32,999
Alex Chilton at age 16

1617
01:39:33,067 --> 01:39:35,467
had a #1 hit
with a group called the Box Tops,

1618
01:39:35,536 --> 01:39:38,630
a song called 'the Letter."
then he had a group called Big Star.

1619
01:39:38,706 --> 01:39:40,666
Big Star wasn't well-known.
They did three albums,

1620
01:39:40,708 --> 01:39:42,232
but "Rolling stone" put all three albums

1621
01:39:42,309 --> 01:39:45,745
in the Top 500 albums
ever produced in America.

1622
01:39:45,813 --> 01:39:48,145
He was supposed to play
at South by Southwest

1623
01:39:48,215 --> 01:39:50,080
this week in Austin.
They are mourning him.

1624
01:39:50,150 --> 01:39:52,641
He is an embodiment
of Memphis music...

1625
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:56,247
hard, different, independent,
brilliant, beautiful.

1626
01:39:56,323 --> 01:39:58,188
We're lucky he came our way.

1627
01:40:04,164 --> 01:40:07,065
You know, obviously
this has been a difficult thing

1628
01:40:07,134 --> 01:40:10,570
and I'll just say, you know,
after the news

1629
01:40:10,637 --> 01:40:12,662
on Wednesday about Alex's passing,

1630
01:40:12,740 --> 01:40:14,820
my instinct was
"We'll probably cancel everything,"

1631
01:40:14,842 --> 01:40:16,867
and that was sort
of the initial impulse.

1632
01:40:16,944 --> 01:40:19,105
But after talking with Jody,
it seemed like

1633
01:40:19,179 --> 01:40:22,444
the best thing to do was to play.

1634
01:40:22,516 --> 01:40:25,781
So anyway, just tell a little bit about
the show, just so folks know. Tonight...

1635
01:40:25,853 --> 01:40:27,548
Well, a lot of people
have agreed to come.

1636
01:40:27,621 --> 01:40:31,921
You know, we'll play some of the stuff
we always sang, but, I mean, everybody...

1637
01:40:31,992 --> 01:40:36,554
we've got like Evan Dando,
John Doe, Chris Stamey.

1638
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:40,691
I think we're going to talk Andy
into getting up and playing on a song.

1639
01:40:40,768 --> 01:40:43,259
Uh, the Watson Twins,
Sondre Lerche...

1640
01:40:43,337 --> 01:40:44,736
- Mike Mills.
- ...Mike Mills.

1641
01:41:01,388 --> 01:41:07,657
" Lord, I've been trying. "

1642
01:41:07,728 --> 01:41:12,131
" To be what I should. "

1643
01:41:14,868 --> 01:41:19,168
" Lord, I've been trying..."

1644
01:41:19,239 --> 01:41:22,697
I guess REM was just getting started.
I mean, I was in college still...

1645
01:41:24,078 --> 01:41:28,674
and... trying to sort out all the things
you're trying to sort out in college.

1646
01:41:28,749 --> 01:41:30,189
We were just forming our band and...

1647
01:41:32,019 --> 01:41:35,079
just beginning to write songs and trying
to figure out how to go about that

1648
01:41:35,155 --> 01:41:37,851
and Big Star was always
a benchmark for me, all my life.

1649
01:41:37,925 --> 01:41:40,325
If I could ever make a record
as good as any of the Big Star stuff,

1650
01:41:40,394 --> 01:41:42,988
that's kind of how I felt
I would be successful.

1651
01:41:43,063 --> 01:41:49,468
" Lord, I've been trying..."

1652
01:41:49,536 --> 01:41:53,802
They have this legendary
status among musicians, for sure.

1653
01:41:53,874 --> 01:41:55,432
When people say Big Star,

1654
01:41:55,509 --> 01:41:58,376
it's just... it's not an era thing,
it's a band thing.

1655
01:41:58,445 --> 01:42:00,504
" Think about her all the time... "

1656
01:42:00,581 --> 01:42:02,378
They 're alone. They're Big Star.

1657
01:42:02,449 --> 01:42:04,383
That's one of those bands
like where you go, "Big Star."

1658
01:42:04,451 --> 01:42:06,544
You don't go, "Big Star and that ilk."

1659
01:42:11,058 --> 01:42:13,026
I've listened to his records
on many, many occasions,

1660
01:42:13,093 --> 01:42:15,391
but I've never had to sing them.

1661
01:42:15,462 --> 01:42:18,363
You can see that a lot of time
was spent making those records.

1662
01:42:18,432 --> 01:42:20,662
You know, they are things of beauty.

1663
01:42:20,734 --> 01:42:23,032
It's difficult to find a weak moment.

1664
01:42:23,103 --> 01:42:24,365
There aren't any.

1665
01:42:24,438 --> 01:42:29,398
" Won't you let me walk
you home from school? "

1666
01:42:29,476 --> 01:42:33,810
it all makes perfect sense now,
when the artist is in the shadows.

1667
01:42:33,881 --> 01:42:35,906
That's the stuff that people
actually want to go and hear.

1668
01:42:35,983 --> 01:42:38,315
And Big Star has joined that club.

1669
01:42:51,798 --> 01:42:53,698
They've only made these three records

1670
01:42:53,767 --> 01:42:55,701
and there's a different line up
with each album

1671
01:42:55,769 --> 01:42:57,430
and a different kind of approach.

1672
01:42:57,504 --> 01:42:59,404
The thing that holds the band together,

1673
01:42:59,473 --> 01:43:02,840
I suppose, is trying to express
something melancholic

1674
01:43:02,910 --> 01:43:06,903
and something exuberant.
It's kind of two extremes.

1675
01:43:06,980 --> 01:43:08,242
" A cool jerk. "

1676
01:43:12,786 --> 01:43:16,119
" Oh, I want you. "

1677
01:43:18,358 --> 01:43:23,159
" Like a kangaroo. "

1678
01:43:24,464 --> 01:43:26,227
Well, there's two separate dreams...

1679
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:27,597
have always been in my head.

1680
01:43:27,668 --> 01:43:32,571
There was a dream of really putting out
the best record you could,

1681
01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:37,201
and it was just like you wanted to,
versus some other dream

1682
01:43:37,277 --> 01:43:40,110
which would be being
commercially successful about it.

1683
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:41,860
I thought about
the former dream a lot more

1684
01:43:41,882 --> 01:43:43,522
than I ever thought
about the other dream.

1685
01:43:58,465 --> 01:44:04,631
" I see sadness in your eyes... "

1686
01:44:04,705 --> 01:44:07,003
" it has been said
that art should create the sense

1687
01:44:07,074 --> 01:44:08,632
that time has stopped.

1688
01:44:08,709 --> 01:44:12,577
Big Star transcended
normal escapist pop convention

1689
01:44:12,646 --> 01:44:15,410
by creating music
that somehow froze moments

1690
01:44:15,482 --> 01:44:19,145
that were concurrently vibrant
and yet startlingly brilliant,

1691
01:44:19,219 --> 01:44:20,948
and yet oddly spent. "

1692
01:44:24,591 --> 01:44:28,652
it was after
my mother died in this home,

1693
01:44:28,729 --> 01:44:30,924
my brother-in-law noticed some people

1694
01:44:30,998 --> 01:44:32,795
in the front yard...

1695
01:44:32,866 --> 01:44:35,630
taking pictures of the house.

1696
01:44:36,670 --> 01:44:38,638
They said, "We're from New York

1697
01:44:38,705 --> 01:44:40,832
and we're fans of Chris Bell."

1698
01:44:40,907 --> 01:44:42,738
That knocked us all out.

1699
01:44:46,346 --> 01:44:48,814
Having a very personal
relationship to a band...

1700
01:44:48,882 --> 01:44:51,316
especially if a band
doesn't become big commercially...

1701
01:44:51,385 --> 01:44:54,377
they were trying to do something.
They were shooting for the moon,

1702
01:44:54,454 --> 01:44:58,117
a certain kind of purity in terms of
what the music was going to sound like.

1703
01:44:58,191 --> 01:45:01,024
It's more an idea
I think on some levels.

1704
01:45:04,031 --> 01:45:06,397
It was too individual.

1705
01:45:06,466 --> 01:45:08,400
It was too Memphis.

1706
01:45:08,468 --> 01:45:13,064
It was unrecoupable
and has never really recouped,

1707
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:16,166
but nevertheless it changed music.

1708
01:45:17,210 --> 01:45:22,307
They were there waiting,
like a little jewel in the earth,

1709
01:45:22,382 --> 01:45:24,907
for me to dig them out
and to find them

1710
01:45:24,985 --> 01:45:27,852
and to appreciate them retrospectively.

1711
01:45:27,921 --> 01:45:33,257
That, to me, is a great gift
of recorded music.

1712
01:45:33,327 --> 01:45:37,696
My personal viewpoint on...
Big Star story

1713
01:45:37,764 --> 01:45:40,665
is pain transformed into beauty.

1714
01:45:40,734 --> 01:45:43,498
Everybody suffered,
everybody feels pain,

1715
01:45:43,570 --> 01:45:46,698
not everybody turns that
into that kind of art.

1716
01:45:46,773 --> 01:45:48,934
It really harkened back to real,

1717
01:45:49,009 --> 01:45:52,001
authentic pain,
real, authentic loneliness...

1718
01:45:52,079 --> 01:45:54,343
things that would
become alternative music

1719
01:45:54,414 --> 01:45:56,006
20 years later.

1720
01:45:56,083 --> 01:46:00,679
" They never gave a damn for us. "

1721
01:46:00,754 --> 01:46:03,951
" Never gave a hand to us... "

1722
01:46:04,024 --> 01:46:05,787
I'm not sure where we belonged

1723
01:46:05,859 --> 01:46:07,884
and maybe that's why
I wasn't so surprised

1724
01:46:07,961 --> 01:46:10,623
when Big Star wasn't
commercially successful.

1725
01:46:12,132 --> 01:46:15,067
But it seems to belong now.

1726
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:57,574
" September gurls do so much."

1727
01:46:57,644 --> 01:47:02,081
" I was your butch
and you were touched. "

1728
01:47:02,149 --> 01:47:06,176
" I loved you,
well, never mind. "

1729
01:47:06,253 --> 01:47:10,314
" I've been crying all the time. "

1730
01:47:10,390 --> 01:47:14,690
" December boys got it bad. "

1731
01:47:14,761 --> 01:47:18,026
" December boys got it bad. "

1732
01:47:27,374 --> 01:47:31,606
" September gurls,
I don't know why. "

1733
01:47:31,678 --> 01:47:35,842
" How can I deny what's inside? "

1734
01:47:35,916 --> 01:47:40,216
" Even though I'll keep away. "

1735
01:47:40,287 --> 01:47:44,223
" They will love all our days. "

1736
01:47:44,291 --> 01:47:48,489
" December boys got it bad. "

1737
01:47:48,562 --> 01:47:52,089
" December boys got it bad. "

1738
01:47:56,937 --> 01:48:01,465
" When I get to bed late at night. "

1739
01:48:01,541 --> 01:48:05,500
" That's the time
she makes things right. "

1740
01:48:05,579 --> 01:48:10,039
" Ooh, when
she makes love to me. "

1741
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:39,278
" At nighttime
I go out and see the people. "

1742
01:48:39,346 --> 01:48:44,283
" Air goes cool
and hurryin" on my way. "

1743
01:48:44,351 --> 01:48:49,687
" And dressing so sweet,
all the people to see. "

1744
01:48:49,756 --> 01:48:54,216
" They're looking at me,
all the people to see. "

1745
01:48:57,764 --> 01:49:01,097
" And when I set my eyes on you. "

1746
01:49:03,637 --> 01:49:06,765
" You look like a kitty. "

1747
01:49:08,341 --> 01:49:11,742
" And when you're in the moon. "

1748
01:49:13,780 --> 01:49:17,181
" Oh, you look so pretty. "

1749
01:49:18,385 --> 01:49:21,548
" Caught a glance in your eyes. "

1750
01:49:21,621 --> 01:49:24,089
" And fell through the skies. "

1751
01:49:24,157 --> 01:49:26,785
" Glance in your eyes. "

1752
01:49:26,860 --> 01:49:30,091
" And fell through the skies. "

1753
01:49:58,925 --> 01:50:02,361
" I'm walking down
the freezing street. "

1754
01:50:04,698 --> 01:50:08,156
" Scarf goes out behind. "

1755
01:50:09,569 --> 01:50:13,528
" You said, "Get them away. "

1756
01:50:15,275 --> 01:50:18,836
" Please don't say a word. "

1757
01:50:20,046 --> 01:50:25,507
" Get me out of here,
get me out of here. "

1758
01:50:25,585 --> 01:50:30,648
" I hate it here,
get me out of here."

1759
01:50:33,927 --> 01:50:39,365
" At nighttime I go out
and see the people. "

1760
01:50:39,432 --> 01:50:44,529
" Air goes cool
and hurrying on my way. "

1761
01:50:44,604 --> 01:50:47,038
" Glanced in your eyes. "

1762
01:50:47,107 --> 01:50:49,803
" And fell through the skies. "

1763
01:50:49,876 --> 01:50:55,712
" Glanced in your eyes
and fell through the skies. "
