1
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,307
Holding. Holding. Ready?

2
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:02,561
- Yeah, let's go. Up, up, up.
Come on, boys, tackle, tackle.

3
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,825
Good work, boys. Keep it up. Good work.

4
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,302
Mandela! Mandela!

5
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:48,565
Mandela! Mandela! Mandela!

6
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,535
Who is it, sir?

7
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:02,830
It is that terrorist, Mandela.
They let him out.

8
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,414
Remember this day, boys.

9
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:07,543
This is the day our country
went to the dogs.

10
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,962
Come. Let's go. Come.

11
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,842
I am now in a position to announce
that Mr. Nelson Mandela will be released...

12
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,219
...at the Victor Verster Prison...

13
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:21,849
...on Sunday, the 11th of February,
at about 3 p.m.

14
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:24,601
There's Mr. Nelson Mandela.

15
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,854
Mr. Mandela, a free man...

16
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:30,232
...taking his first steps
into a new South Africa.

17
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:34,236
This is the moment
the world has been waiting for.

18
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:38,866
MAN 2: And the top news of the day here
in South Africa and around the world.

19
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:42,035
The recent release
of Nelson Mandela from prison...

20
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:46,874
...has triggered a power struggle
between the ANC and their black rivals.

21
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:50,419
There are reports that the government
has been secretly providing arms...

22
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,921
...to these groups,
contributing to the violence...

23
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,632
...that has erupted
throughout the country.

24
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,428
South Africa appears to be
on the verge of a civil war.

25
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,346
Mr. Mandela has traveled to Durban...

26
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:06,351
...in an effort to persuade 100,000 angry
young ANC supporters on the frontline...

27
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,103
...to make peace.

28
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:12,858
Take your knives and your guns
and your pangas...

29
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,943
...and throw them into the sea.

30
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,950
MAN 2: After four years of talks,
the day black South Africans...

31
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,953
...have been fighting for
has finally arrived.

32
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:29,625
For the first time, they are free
to cast their vote alongside whites.

33
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,711
An estimated 23 million people
went to the polls today.

34
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:38,300
I, Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela...

35
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:44,932
...do hereby swear to be faithful
to the Republic of South Africa.

36
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:51,730
Never, never and never again shall it be...

37
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,234
...that this beautiful land will again...

38
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:59,988
...experience the oppression
of one by another...

39
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:06,411
...and suffer the indignity
of being the skunk of the world.

40
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:18,715
Madiba!

41
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,386
Here he is. Like clockwork.

42
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,221
That makes him such an easy target.

43
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,526
Yes, good morning.

44
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,195
How are you?

45
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:25,407
- Us is sharp, Madiba.
- Good.

46
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:28,577
- Linga, how's your mother?
- She's much better. Thanks.

47
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,537
Good, very good.

48
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,037
Linga, watch your left.

49
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,960
Madiba. Madiba.

50
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,431
It's all right.

51
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,144
What does it say?

52
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,943
It says, "He can win an election,
but can he run a country?"

53
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,321
Not even one day on the job
and they are after you.

54
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:49,366
It's a legitimate question.

55
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,708
Today marks the beginning
of a new era in South Africa...

56
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:43,378
...as President Mandela takes office
in Pretoria.

57
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,756
Facing issues that range from
economic stagnation and unemployment...

58
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,092
...to rising crime,
while at the same time...

59
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,763
...balancing black aspirations
with white fears.

60
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:58,059
I never thought I'd see the day.
I feel sorry for you, son.

61
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:01,271
You got your whole life ahead of you.
What's it gonna be like now?

62
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,647
- Don't be so gloomy.
- Yeah.

63
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,193
Now, I added vitamins.
There's a horrible flu bug going around.

64
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,738
- You tell Nerine when you get home?
- Thanks, Mom.

65
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,573
Now, I'm telling you, FranÃ§ois.

66
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,826
Look at Angola, look at Mozambique,
look at Zimbabwe.

67
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,244
We're next.

68
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:19,581
They're gonna take our jobs
and they're gonna drive us into the sea.

69
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,249
Just you wait.

70
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,435
Good morning.

71
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:55,617
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

72
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,495
- Good morning, everyone. Good morning.

73
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,331
Brenda, you've had your hair done.
I like it.

74
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,541
Thank you, Madiba.

75
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,086
Yeah, we need to talk about
your cabinet appointments and ministers.

76
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,129
- Give me one moment, please.
- Yes, Madiba.

77
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:11,091
- After you, Comrade President.
- Thank you, sir.

78
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,726
Office of the president, good morning.

79
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,938
Brenda.

80
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:29,818
Please assemble all the staff for me.
All those who haven't already left.

81
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,778
Right now? All of them?

82
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,990
- Yes, please.
- Yes, Madiba.

83
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:39,452
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you would like to follow me, please.

84
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,497
The president would like
to speak with you.

85
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,422
- Here he comes.
- Yeah.

86
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,508
He wants the satisfaction
of firing us himself.

87
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,469
- I'd like you to stay out here.
- Yes, but, Madiba...

88
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,931
I cannot talk to them
hiding behind men with guns.

89
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,353
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

90
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,688
Good morning.

91
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,690
- How are you this morning?
- Fine.

92
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,900
It's good to see you.

93
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:14,529
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

94
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,616
Some of you may know who I am.

95
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:24,539
I could not help
noticing the empty offices...

96
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,875
...as I came to work this morning...

97
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,794
...and all of the packing boxes.

98
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:35,467
Now, of course, if you want to leave,
that is your right.

99
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:42,140
And if you feel in your heart that you
cannot work with your new government...

100
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,267
...then it is better that you do leave.

101
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,478
Right away.

102
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,731
But if you are packing up
because you fear...

103
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:55,403
...that your language
or the color of your skin...

104
00:10:55,738 --> 00:11:00,575
...or who you worked for before
disqualifies you from working here...

105
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:05,455
...I am here to tell you,
have no such fear.

106
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,540
What is verby is verby.

107
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,127
The past is the past.

108
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,588
We look to the future now.

109
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,341
We need your help.

110
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,760
We want your help.

111
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,263
If you would like to stay...

112
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:26,935
...you would be doing
your country a great service.

113
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:33,441
All I ask is that you do your work
to the best of your abilities...

114
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,902
...and with good heart.

115
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,071
I promise to do the same.

116
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:45,245
If we can manage that, our country
will be a shining light in the world.

117
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,047
Thank you.

118
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,051
- Is it still morning?
- Yeah.

119
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,619
When you get a chance,
can we get the schedule for the month?

120
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:06,307
- Yeah.
- We need to plan security.

121
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,977
Office of the president, good morning.

122
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,105
Yes, sir.
Will do, we'll have that ready for you.

123
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,987
We need more men.

124
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,322
Did you talk to Brenda about it?

125
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,867
Yes. Yesterday.

126
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,121
That must be Jessie
with the schedule.

127
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,497
Come in, beautiful.

128
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,336
What's this?

129
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:36,921
Mr. Jason Tshabalala?

130
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,591
That's me. Am I under arrest?

131
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:43,428
Captain Feyder and team,
reporting for duty, sir.

132
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,680
What duty?

133
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:50,059
We're the presidential bodyguard.
We've been assigned to this office.

134
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,228
Here are our orders.

135
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,358
You're Special Branch, right?

136
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,361
You'll see that they've been signed.

137
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,363
Well, I don't care if they are signed...

138
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,704
Just wait here.

139
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,514
Sorry to disturb you, sir.

140
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,432
You look agitated, Jason.

141
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,519
That's because there are four
Special Branch cops in my office.

142
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:35,522
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

143
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:39,734
They say they are presidential bodyguards
and they have orders signed by you.

144
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:46,157
Yes. Yes. Well, these men
are special trained by SAS.

145
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,577
They have lots of experience.
They protected de Klerk.

146
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:53,581
- Yes, but it doesn't mean that they have to...
- You asked for more men, didn't you?

147
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,334
- Yes, sir, I asked...
- When people see me in public...

148
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,711
...they see my bodyguards.

149
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,965
You represent me directly.

150
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:05,426
The rainbow nation starts here.

151
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:10,014
- Reconciliation starts here.
- Reconciliation, sir?

152
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,934
Yes, reconciliation, Jason.

153
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:16,354
Comrade President, not long ago,
these guys tried to kill us.

154
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,607
Maybe even these four guys
in my office tried and often succeeded.

155
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,025
Yes, I know.

156
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,903
Forgiveness starts here too.

157
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,198
Forgiveness liberates the soul.

158
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:33,538
It removes fear.
That is why it is such a powerful weapon.

159
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:39,085
Please, Jason. Try.

160
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,465
Sorry to disturb you, sir.

161
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,265
Just a minute.

162
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,267
Two copies of the schedule.

163
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,769
Thank you, Jessie.

164
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,491
Jason, can we get rid of these guys now?

165
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,748
This is the schedule for the month.

166
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,501
Let's look them over for assignments.

167
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,712
- Right.
- What?

168
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:28,885
Hey, Jason. I need to talk to you.

169
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,687
How can we trust them?

170
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:44,025
We can't. That's what Madiba wants, okay?
Let's go.

171
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,364
Are there any special orders
or conditions?

172
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,700
No. Yes.

173
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:57,038
Madiba doesn't like it if you don't
smile when you push people away.

174
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,206
Seriously?

175
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:02,877
Yes, seriously. It's the new South Africa.

176
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,463
Madiba?

177
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,132
That's the president's clan name.

178
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,551
That's what we call him.

179
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,138
We'll call him Mr. President.

180
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,017
Can we go through the schedule now?

181
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,687
Can you gentlemen come closer?

182
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:36,077
How's he going to do all this?
When does he take a break?

183
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,871
He says he rested enough in prison.

184
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,834
- Here's a headache.
- What?

185
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,920
The rugby match.

186
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:50,091
England against Springboks,
Loftus Stadium.

187
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,886
Gonna be a headache for England,
that's for sure. We're gonna donnerthem.

188
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,764
I don't care about the game.
All I care about...

189
00:16:56,932 --> 00:17:00,226
...is that the president will be exposed.
- To a thousand drunken boys.

190
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,395
Sports fans?

191
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:06,024
Yes. Sports fans.

192
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:10,111
Who didn't vote for him.
Who probably hate him.

193
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,865
Who came out of the womb with guns
in their hands.

194
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,911
What?

195
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,129
Let's welcome captain FranÃ§ois Pienaar...

196
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:32,675
...and the South African Springboks
here in Pretoria.

197
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:37,972
Today's referee is Colin Hawke
from New Zealand.

198
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,898
Bokke! Bokke! Bokke!

199
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,235
Okay, guys.

200
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:55,406
I want your eyes on the crowd at all times.
You're staying in the middle of the field.

201
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,743
You're gonna walk in, shake hands,
and walk back and that's it.

202
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,495
- You got it?
- Yup.

203
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,413
Okay, let's go.

204
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:22,100
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is our pleasure to have with us today...

205
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:26,354
...at Loftus Versfeld,
our newly elected president...

206
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,399
...Mr. Nelson Mandela.

207
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,537
Mandela!

208
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,543
Well, good luck, captain.

209
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,338
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you.

210
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,882
- Good luck, son.
- Thank you very much.

211
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,926
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

212
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,514
- Good luck, Chester.
- Yes, sir.

213
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,558
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

214
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,644
Sir.

215
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,760
- Stop him.
JASON: No, stay with him.

216
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:51,189
- Thank you for honoring our new flag.
- It's a pleasure, sir.

217
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,732
Thank you.

218
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,442
How are you? How are you?

219
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,278
- Good to see you. Good to see you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

220
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,447
- Madiba.
- Hi.

221
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,783
Madiba? Madiba?
We're delaying the rugby, sir.

222
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,453
Yes. Yes, of course.

223
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,968
- Why didn't you stop him?
- Well, you try next time.

224
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:24,472
- Does he do that sort of thing all the time?
- Ask my ulcers.

225
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,059
- Good thing it was just a cup.
And good thing he never saw it.

226
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,478
He saw it. He sees everything.

227
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,730
I hate rugby.

228
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,023
Engage!

229
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,848
With you, with you! Here, onside,
onside!

230
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,581
Come on! Now, now, now!

231
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,464
Try, England.

232
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:02,635
For England, scored by Ben Clarke,
Number 13.

233
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,847
England, 11, South Africa, 0.

234
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,516
Fuck, man.

235
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,146
These okes mean business.
We need to focus.

236
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,524
Come, okes, we need to focus, focus!

237
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:21,028
Let's go, boys.
- Right, come on.

238
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,498
Conversion is good.

239
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,209
Why don't we do a little work
while we watch?

240
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:39,171
- We have a lot of promises to keep.
- Yes, we do.

241
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:49,765
Well, it's not too late,
if the boys can just pick up their game.

242
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,559
If they don't, heads will roll.

243
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,690
Come on, you bloody bastards.

244
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,035
Where do you want to go first
for foreign investment?

245
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,661
Where the money is.

246
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:14,915
America, England, Saudi Arabia.

247
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,840
How long before the World Cup?

248
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,009
About a year.

249
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:29,555
Well, it's time enough for improvement.

250
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,099
Mr. President.

251
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,769
Don't get your hopes up.

252
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,605
We're a damn disgrace.

253
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:42,443
England, 24, South Africa, 9.

254
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,279
Do you see all those old apartheid flags?

255
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,782
They're a disgrace.

256
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,784
It is also a constitutional right.

257
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:54,038
Along with the apartheid anthem, I know.

258
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,083
But it's time people moved on.

259
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,462
Look at this.

260
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:06,133
All of the whites are cheering
for the Springboks.

261
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,719
All of the blacks are cheering
for England.

262
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,142
We used to do that on the island,
you know.

263
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:18,521
We would cheer for anyone but the Boks.

264
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,399
It made the warders very angry.

265
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,442
Of course it did.

266
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:29,188
- Sorry I'm late. How is it going?
Number 10.

267
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,158
Very badly.

268
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,165
Maybe it's just as well.

269
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,000
Why?

270
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:45,506
I've just been at a meeting
of the National Sports executive.

271
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:52,138
There's a strong support to drop the
Springbok emblem and colors altogether.

272
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:58,310
If they play badly,
maybe it's a good time to make a change.

273
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:02,690
This could be the last time
we have to look at the green and gold.

274
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:24,378
Fuck, man. This is bullshit.

275
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:45,733
FranÃ§ois Pienaar's team came to
Loftus Versfeld Stadium this afternoon...

276
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:49,028
...unprepared and arrogant.

277
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,946
They left 80 minutes later...

278
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:54,742
...with their tails between their legs
like whipped mongrels.

279
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,578
And I, for one, am glad.

280
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:01,874
Not because they lost,
but because there is now no way...

281
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:06,045
...to ignore the fact that we are
completely and utterly unprepared...

282
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:10,674
...to reenter the world
of topnotch international rugby.

283
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:14,220
The Rugby World Cup
is now less than a year away.

284
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:17,223
And I, for one, am relieved
that we are the host nation...

285
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,059
...and therefore qualify automatically
for the tournament.

286
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,603
- Somebody gets the ax.
- Because I am not sure...

287
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:27,066
...that we would get in on merit alone.
- Who's it gonna be?

288
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:30,277
Pienaar's team played
without discipline...

289
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:34,281
...without strategy and without courage.

290
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,368
- And therefore...
- He's trying to get them to drop me.

291
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:41,080
He's just bitter because the Springboks
were boycotted when he played.

292
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:44,625
Maybe. But people listen
to what he says.

293
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,294
They brought shame upon our nation.

294
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:51,465
And I, for one, can say
without fear of contradiction...

295
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,217
...that today, these 15...

296
00:25:55,053 --> 00:26:01,392
...so-called men did not deserve
to wear the hallowed green and gold.

297
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:07,606
Here's your muti, Madiba.
I warmed the milk tonight.

298
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:11,151
You are too good to me, Mary.

299
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:16,156
Your daughter called
to cancel her visit this weekend.

300
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,410
Did she say why?

301
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:22,413
No, she didn't.
She said to tell you she was sorry.

302
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,165
I see.

303
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,836
Do you need anything else tonight?

304
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,172
No, Mary, thank you. I will go to bed.

305
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,508
Good evening, Dada.

306
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,885
Good evening, Mary.

307
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,122
- Hello. There you go.
DLAMINl: God bless you.

308
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,041
Thank you.

309
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:10,919
COLE: Some nice pants for you.
DLAMINl: God bless you.

310
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,547
There you go.

311
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,883
There you go.

312
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,302
DLAMINl: God bless you.

313
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:27,394
You're a very lucky boy.
It's a real Springbok practice jersey.

314
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:32,149
I mean, I know it's a bit big,
but it's warm and it'll last forever.

315
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,068
Come.

316
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,737
Go on, take it, it's yours.

317
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:43,035
- Why won't he take it?
- If he wears it, the others will beat him up.

318
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,412
Because the Springboks
are playing so badly?

319
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:50,167
No, because for them
Springbok still represents apartheid.

320
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:01,679
And now for the next item on our agenda.

321
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:06,975
The NSC executive proposes a vote
on the following motion:

322
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:10,979
That, as a permanent symbol
of the apartheid era...

323
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:14,233
...the colors, emblem...

324
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:20,531
...and the name of the Springboks,
be eliminated immediately.

325
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:27,204
And that all sports teams
representing South Africa...

326
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:30,958
...shall be known forthwith...

327
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:34,128
...as the Proteas.

328
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:38,173
Now, comrades,
we will submit this motion to a hand vote.

329
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:44,138
And in the event of a close count,
we'll go to a written ballot.

330
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:49,435
All of those in favor of eliminating
the Springboks, raise your hands.

331
00:28:52,147 --> 00:29:00,147
- Viva, Proteas, viva!
- Viva!

332
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,332
Both units to their cars right now.

333
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,960
All right, let's go. Let's do it.

334
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,093
What do I tell
the Japanese trade delegation?

335
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,845
I delegate that decision to you.

336
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,264
- Do you want me to inform the VP?
- No.

337
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,683
We should at least include
the minister of sport.

338
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:30,893
No.

339
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,313
I strongly advise against doing this,
especially on your own.

340
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,982
It gives the impression
of autocratic leadership.

341
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,569
You risk alienating your cabinet
and your party.

342
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,279
Your advice is duly noted.

343
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:46,283
Madiba. The people want this.
They hate the Springboks.

344
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,620
They don't want to be represented
by a team they cheered against.

345
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,498
Yes, I know. But in this instance,
the people are wrong.

346
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:56,210
And as their elected leader,
it is my job to show them that.

347
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,670
You're risking your political capital.

348
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,964
You're risking your future as our leader.

349
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:05,052
The day I am afraid to do that
is the day I am no longer fit to lead.

350
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:12,768
At least risk it for something
more important than rugby.

351
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:16,522
Tell the boys I want to go
to Eersterust, very fast.

352
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:34,414
We, the executive, would like
to applaud you for your diligence...

353
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,084
...and your courage.

354
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:47,052
Please join us in our anthem.

355
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,124
Comrades, comrades,
members of the choir.

356
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:22,838
We would only interrupt such beautiful
music for something truly important.

357
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:27,134
Please, welcome President Mandela.

358
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,432
Thank you.

359
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,727
WOMadiba. Welcome, Madiba.

360
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,479
Thank you. Mandela.

361
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:44,985
- Mandela.
- Thank you.

362
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:51,825
I thank you. Please.

363
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,328
Smile.

364
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,792
Brothers...

365
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,170
...sisters...

366
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,631
...comrades.

367
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:11,845
I am here because
I believe you have made a decision...

368
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:17,517
...with insufficient information
and foresight.

369
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:21,521
I am aware of your earlier vote.

370
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:27,819
I am aware that it was unanimous.

371
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:35,827
Nonetheless, I believe
we should restore the Springboks.

372
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:44,044
Restore their name, their emblem...

373
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,713
...and their colors immediately.

374
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,802
Let me tell you why.

375
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,554
On Robben Island...

376
00:32:55,056 --> 00:33:01,228
...in Pollsmoor Prison,
all of my jailers were Afrikaners.

377
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,022
For 27 years...

378
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,818
...I studied them.

379
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,780
I learned their language.

380
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,075
Read their books...

381
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,911
...their poetry.

382
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,707
I had to know my enemy...

383
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:24,584
...before I could prevail against him.

384
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:29,297
And we did prevail, did we not?

385
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:33,385
All of us here, we prevailed.

386
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:37,264
Our enemy is no longer the Afrikaner.

387
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:41,768
They are our fellow South Africans...

388
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:46,732
...our partners in democracy.

389
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:52,529
And they treasure Springbok rugby.

390
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:58,618
If we take that away, we lose them.

391
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:05,792
We prove that we are
what they feared we would be.

392
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,464
We have to be better than that.

393
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:15,093
We have to surprise them...

394
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,471
...with the compassion...

395
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:23,351
...with restraint and generosity.

396
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:29,816
I know all of the things they denied us.

397
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:36,865
But this is no time
to celebrate petty revenge.

398
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:40,952
This is the time to build our nation...

399
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,082
...using every single brick
available to us.

400
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:49,086
Even if that brick comes wrapped
in green and gold.

401
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:56,676
You elected me your leader.

402
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:00,388
Let me lead you now.

403
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,683
Who is with me on this?

404
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,022
Who is with me?

405
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:27,707
Twelve votes. Twelve.

406
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:32,546
A luxury.
We only needed one more yes than no.

407
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:35,799
What if you hadn't got it?

408
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:40,137
Well, you know,
that is the party's decision.

409
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:44,558
I'm sorry, Madiba, but we've got
problems everywhere we look.

410
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:48,603
Housing, food, jobs, crime. Our currency.

411
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:52,732
You can't keep interrupting
affairs of state to placate a minority.

412
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,152
But I must.

413
00:35:55,319 --> 00:36:01,408
That minority still controls the police,
the army and the economy.

414
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:05,579
If we lose them,
we cannot address the other issues.

415
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:13,420
So this rugby
is just a political calculation?

416
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:18,592
It is a human calculation.

417
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:22,846
If we take away what they cherish...

418
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:26,600
...the Springboks,
their national anthem...

419
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:31,104
...we just reinforce
the cycle of fear between us.

420
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,275
I will do what I must to stop that cycle.

421
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,362
Or it will destroy us.

422
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,621
42, South Africa, 20.

423
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:09,184
Beer tastes like shit, man.

424
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:12,229
It's not the beer.

425
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,274
Take another.

426
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:18,443
Everybody, take one.

427
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,240
Pass them around.

428
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:31,957
Right. I'd like to propose a toast.

429
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,252
To the taste of defeat.

430
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,587
Drink it.

431
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:43,343
Remember this, and promise yourself
never to taste it again.

432
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:49,516
You're right, it tastes like shit.

433
00:37:56,524 --> 00:38:00,026
Okay. Here's the schedule
for the overseas trip.

434
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,987
Let me see.

435
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,499
What did he just say?

436
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,626
He asked when we were supposed
to sleep.

437
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:20,505
- As well as other basic human functions.
JASON: Hey.

438
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:25,010
If Madiba can do it, we can do it.

439
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,729
In a common struggle...

440
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:40,483
...that has brought
about our emancipation...

441
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:45,572
...and pushed back
the frontier of racism...

442
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:51,953
...the millions of our people
say thank you...

443
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,164
...and thank you again.

444
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,750
I come here with a message.

445
00:38:56,917 --> 00:39:00,587
People of the United States of America...

446
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:06,551
...open your markets to us
and come invest in our country.

447
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,929
And in Japan, President Mandela
met with Japanese officials...

448
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,557
...as he concluded a grueling trip
to the Far East.

449
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,727
And in related news, it was announced
that President Mandela...

450
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,104
...will visit South Africa this week.

451
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,317
Stop it, old man.

452
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,033
Gee, it's cold, man.

453
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,213
- Morning, Madiba.
- How are you?

454
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,101
Fine, thanks.
HENDRICK: Morning, sir.

455
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:46,966
How is your family, Hendrick?

456
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,969
Top shape, sir. How about yours?

457
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:55,892
I have a very large family.

458
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,728
Forty-two million.

459
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,443
I don't think I'll walk today.

460
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:11,533
- We never, never ask him about his family.
- But he asks about ours.

461
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,036
Hey, think about it, man.
He's separated from his wife, his children.

462
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:18,039
How often do you see them here?

463
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:23,753
He's not a saint, okay?
He's a man with a man's problems.

464
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,923
He doesn't need us reminding him
about them.

465
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:39,644
- Good morning, Madiba.
- Good morning.

466
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,856
- Thank you very much.
- Enjoy it.

467
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,363
Yes.

468
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:58,872
Very good.

469
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:05,628
- Brenda, good morning.
- Good morning, Madiba.

470
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:09,007
- I like that dress.
- Thank you.

471
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:12,469
- This is for you.
- What is it?

472
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,722
Your paychecks.
You haven't been collecting them.

473
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,519
- What's wrong?
- This is terrible.

474
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:26,399
It's what de Klerk got,
plus an increase for inflation.

475
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:34,240
Today President Mandela
announced that, in his opinion...

476
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:36,493
- Thanks.
...his salary is too high.

477
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,745
Dead right. They're all overpaid.

478
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:43,833
He has, therefore, decided to donate
a third of his monthly income to charity.

479
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:48,379
Give me the houses and cars they give him,
I'll donate a third of my salary too.

480
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:51,090
- You would not, not in a million years.
- Pienaar. Hello.

481
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:52,926
Hang on a moment, please.

482
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:55,512
Mandela says that he wishes
to set an example...

483
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,640
Yes. Of course.
...to other leaders and cabinet ministers.

484
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,233
I thank you. Thank you.
- Fat chance.

485
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,440
They're lining their pockets
as fast as they can.

486
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,272
Must be his girlfriend, Nerine?

487
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,358
He knows I'll bloody well kill him.

488
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,278
What?

489
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:13,947
Who was that?

490
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:16,241
Well...
- I told you it was his girlfriend.

491
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,786
I've been invited to tea.

492
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,956
- With who?
- The president.

493
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,416
President of SA Rugby?

494
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,877
Count your fingers
after he shakes your hand, boy.

495
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,796
The president.

496
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:37,220
He wants me over for tea,
week after next.

497
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:44,269
Mr. FranÃ§ois. You must tell Madiba
that the bus service is very bad...

498
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:47,272
...and too expensive.
He must do something about it.

499
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,817
- Good night, everybody.
Good night, Eunice.

500
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,443
Thank you.

501
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,821
What the hell does he want with you?

502
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,492
I don't know.

503
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:06,833
FranÃ§ois, relax, you've met him before.

504
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:09,919
- I shook his hand on the rugby field.
- And you didn't even vote.

505
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,214
Come on, Nooks, he's still the president.

506
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,592
I play rugby.
What am I gonna say to the guy?

507
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,636
Say to him, "Thank you for inviting me."

508
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,681
What if I pull something stupid
in front of him?

509
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:25,518
You won't.
Okay, I'll pick you up right here.

510
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,398
Bye. There's FranÃ§ois.

511
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:34,360
- FranÃ§ois, picture, please.
FranÃ§ois, can we get picture?

512
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:37,113
Yeah, okay. Over here, okay?

513
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:41,993
How's it? Can we have a comment?

514
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,214
See who's coming for tea?

515
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:57,508
Yeah, my nephew wanted me
to get his autograph.

516
00:43:57,676 --> 00:44:00,803
- Who?
- FranÃ§ois Pienaar.

517
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:03,473
- Who wants to escort him in?
- I will.

518
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:07,185
- Hey, no autographs, okay?
- I know how to do my job, okay?

519
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:10,813
Who's this FranÃ§ois Pienaar?

520
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:14,233
You can't be serious.
He's the captain of the Springboks.

521
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,402
I like soccer, myself.

522
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,446
Well, you know
what they say about soccer.

523
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,865
It's a gentlemen's game
played by hooligans.

524
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:24,494
On the other hand, rugby is
a hooligan's game played by gentlemen.

525
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:28,581
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard that one
before. It wasn't funny the first time.

526
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:34,087
- Can I ask you a question, lieutenant?
- Yeah, of course.

527
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,089
What's he like?

528
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:39,884
When I worked for the previous president,
it was my job to be invisible.

529
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,804
This president, well,
he found out I liked English toffee...

530
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:45,932
...and he brought me some back
from his visit in England.

531
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,309
To him, no one's invisible.

532
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:52,522
That's where you wait.
One of his assistants will come for you.

533
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,149
And the bathroom's over there
if you need it.

534
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,610
Okay. Thanks.

535
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:03,491
What are our chances in the World Cup?
I mean, for real.

536
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,453
We'll do our best. That, I can guarantee.

537
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:14,877
Office of the president.

538
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,885
So, what is he like?

539
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,888
Well, he's not as big as he looks on TV.

540
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:29,308
And we don't stand a bloody chance
in the World Cup.

541
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,274
Office of the president.

542
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:42,697
Mr. Pienaar. Right this way, please.

543
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:45,408
Yeah. Thank you.

544
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:48,244
Go on in.

545
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,205
FranÃ§ois.

546
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:53,624
What an honor.

547
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:58,004
I am so excited. Thank you
for coming all this way to see me.

548
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,673
Yes, sir. Thank you for inviting me,
Mr. President.

549
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,843
So, tell me, FranÃ§ois, how is your ankle?

550
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:09,807
- My ankle?
- I was told it was hurt. Has it healed?

551
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:15,646
The truth is, sir, you never really play
at 100 percent, no matter what.

552
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:19,025
Yes. In sports as in life?

553
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,027
- Yes, sir.
- Please, sit.

554
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:25,281
Take this one.
Looking into the light hurts my eyes.

555
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:33,915
Mrs. Brits.
You are a shining light in my day.

556
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:35,875
Yes, sir.

557
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:40,505
Mrs. Brits, this is FranÃ§ois Pienaar,
captain of the Springboks.

558
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:45,510
Shall I pour, sir?

559
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:48,554
No, no. I would prefer to do it myself.

560
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:51,557
Thank you very much, Mrs. Brits.

561
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:56,103
How do you like your tea, FranÃ§ois?

562
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:58,397
Just milk, please.

563
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:02,902
The English have given us many things...

564
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,404
...including rugby.

565
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:11,744
But afternoon tea, that is the greatest.

566
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:13,871
There we are.

567
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:15,498
Thank you, sir.

568
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:19,168
You have a very difficult job.

569
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,087
I do?

570
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:24,215
I have a trading business.

571
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,843
Captain of the Springboks.

572
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:30,388
A very difficult job.

573
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,849
Well, not compared to yours,
Mr. President.

574
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:39,939
Well, no one is trying to tear my head off
while I'm doing mine.

575
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,315
Yes, sir.

576
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:43,776
Tell me, FranÃ§ois...

577
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:47,446
...what is your philosophy on leadership?

578
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:51,450
How do you inspire your team
to do their best?

579
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:56,038
By example. I've always thought
to lead by example, sir.

580
00:47:56,206 --> 00:48:00,042
Well, that is right. That is exactly right.

581
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:04,964
But how to get them to be better
than they think they can be?

582
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,258
That is very difficult, I find.

583
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:11,012
Inspiration, perhaps.

584
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:16,058
How do we inspire ourselves to greatness,
when nothing less will do?

585
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:20,813
How do we inspire everyone around us?

586
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:25,234
I sometimes think it is
by using the work of others.

587
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,780
On Robben Island...

588
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:33,576
...when things got very bad...

589
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,662
...I found inspiration in a poem.

590
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:41,125
- A poem?
- A Victorian poem.

591
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,086
Just words.

592
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:50,843
But they helped me to stand
when all I wanted to do was to lie down.

593
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,848
But you didn't come all this way
to hear an old man talk...

594
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,683
...about things that make no sense.

595
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:00,811
No, no, please, Mr. President.
It makes complete sense to me.

596
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:06,192
On the day of a big match, say, a test...

597
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:10,363
...in the bus on the way to the stadium,
nobody talks.

598
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:15,284
- Yes. They're all preparing.
- Right.

599
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:20,331
But when I think we're ready,
I have the bus driver put on a song.

600
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:23,459
Something I've chosen, one we all know.

601
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:27,171
And we listen to the words together.

602
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:29,715
And it helps.

603
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:38,641
I remember when I was invited to
the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona.

604
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:44,313
Everybody in the stadium
greeted me with a song.

605
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:47,525
At the time, the future...

606
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:51,821
...our future, seemed very bleak.

607
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:58,285
But to hear that song in the voices
of people from all over our planet...

608
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:02,164
...made me proud to be South African.

609
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:06,585
It inspired me to come home
and do better.

610
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:11,173
It allowed me to expect more of myself.

611
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,427
May I ask, what was the song, sir?

612
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:19,557
Well, it was "Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika."

613
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:23,436
A very inspiring song.

614
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:28,315
We need inspiration, FranÃ§ois.

615
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:32,528
Because in order to build our nation...

616
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:37,283
...we must all exceed
our own expectations.

617
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:53,132
So, what's he like?

618
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:57,762
He's not like anyone I've ever met before.

619
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:00,639
Yeah, I hope. What did he want?

620
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:06,687
What did he talk about? Did he talk
about rugby? What did he talk about?

621
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:11,817
FranÃ§ois. It's like talking to
a brick wall. What did he say?

622
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:18,824
I think he wants us to win the World Cup.

623
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,339
Excuse me.

624
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,186
What do you think?

625
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:52,858
- It doesn't matter what I think.
- Yes, it does.

626
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,277
Okay.

627
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,196
He looks like one of the policemen...

628
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:00,366
...who forced us out of our house
when you were in jail.

629
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:03,202
I don't like seeing you shake his hand...

630
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,954
...and I'm not the only one.

631
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:13,546
You criticize without understanding.

632
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:17,383
You seek only to address
your own personal feelings.

633
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,886
That is selfish thinking, Zindzi.

634
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,889
It does not serve the nation.

635
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:30,146
Zindzi, wait, please.

636
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,357
Zindzi, l...

637
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:36,944
Here.

638
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:43,534
- Give this to your mother for me, please.
- What is it?

639
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:46,745
It's a bracelet I found unpacking.

640
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:48,747
Why don't you just throw it away?

641
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:52,668
I don't have the right,
doesn't belong to me.

642
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:57,923
If she left it, she meant to throw it away.

643
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:13,439
Mrs. Pienaar said you were
finished with the paper.

644
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,774
Yeah, yeah, of course.

645
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:22,198
Let's go. Go low. Yeah, that's it. Good
boy.

646
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:24,909
There we go. Hit.

647
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,495
The World Cup is played
every four years.

648
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:31,624
Sixteen teams qualify
from around the world.

649
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:33,667
Four pools of four teams...

650
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:37,421
...each playing in nine different venues
around the country.

651
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:41,634
Two teams will advance from each pool
to the quarterfinals.

652
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:47,223
Ivory Coast qualifies. That's wonderful.

653
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:51,268
According to the experts, we'll reach
the quarterfinals and no further.

654
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:56,941
According to the experts,
you and I should still be in jail.

655
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,613
You make a personal appearance
at the finals...

656
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:06,325
...and at the opening match
between Australia and the Springboks.

657
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:11,830
The finals will be broadcast to over
a billion people around the world, live.

658
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:15,084
A billion people watching us?

659
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:22,216
This is a great opportunity.

660
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:29,640
I reckon you've knocked
the stuffing out of them today.

661
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,350
And now. Come on, boys.

662
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,644
I haven't even begun.

663
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:38,023
We may not be the most talented team
in the world...

664
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:41,026
...but we're sure as hell
going to be the fittest.

665
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:42,236
Let's go again, guys.

666
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:44,697
- Come on, boys, nut up.
- Shit.

667
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,992
Brenda. Yes, sir?

668
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:50,869
Please get the head
of South African Rugby for me.

669
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:53,330
- Right away.
- Thank you.

670
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,668
Yep. One more.

671
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:06,552
Guys, listen up.
Dr. Luyt just wants a few words, please.

672
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:11,473
Afternoon, men.

673
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:14,101
Good to see you all working so hard.

674
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:16,395
I have a short announcement.

675
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:19,356
As part of the PR buildup
to the World Cup...

676
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:23,694
...you will be conducting coaching clinics
in townships all over the country.

677
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:26,739
I know, I know.
You have plenty on your plates already.

678
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:30,075
But this is a request from the top.

679
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,288
The very top.

680
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:36,623
Thank you.

681
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:45,257
This is complete crap, man.

682
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:48,093
What is this?
What are we, some sort of circus act now?

683
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:52,056
We don't have time for shit like this.
They expect us to play our best...

684
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:56,060
...to give our bloody all,
then they add to our bloody workload.

685
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:59,355
What do you think about this, Chester?

686
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:04,234
Well, I try not to think
because it interferes with my rugby.

687
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:08,113
You see? Now, there's a rugby player.
Talk to them, cappie.

688
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:11,158
Make them understand.
We don't have time for this.

689
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,451
Yeah.

690
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,495
- Yeah.
- I'm not going to talk to them.

691
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:16,372
Why not?

692
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:18,582
Okes...

693
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:21,668
...we've become more
than just a rugby team...

694
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:24,296
...and we might as well get used to it.

695
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:30,052
- Is this you speaking or Mandela? Yeah,
exactly.

696
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,221
You know me better than that.

697
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,770
You know, times change.

698
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:44,441
And we need to change as well.

699
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,104
Shit.

700
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:25,482
Yeah. Glad I don't live here?

701
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:30,571
Around there.

702
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:47,963
Don't forget,
we've got cameras on us at all times.

703
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,674
What a bloody joke.

704
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:57,139
Chester! Chester! Chester!

705
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:12,988
Chester, I reckon you're up.

706
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,449
- What am I supposed to do?
- What you do best.

707
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,284
Let rip.

708
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,287
Who wants to play rugby?

709
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:35,761
Who here knows the rules of rugby?

710
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,054
- Me.
- What is it?

711
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:39,223
You hit another player
when the ref is not looking.

712
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,434
No, no, no, the first rule of rugby...

713
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:47,189
...is you can only pass the ball backwards
or sideways, all right? Shall we practice?

714
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,691
- Yes.
- All right. Form a line.

715
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:50,901
Let's go, boys.

716
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,948
Ready? Okay, pass.

717
00:58:58,284 --> 00:59:00,035
Keep your hands up.

718
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:06,124
Yeah!

719
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:10,087
Like this, like this. Pass it here.
I'm here and I'm running like this:

720
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,630
I'm there.

721
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:14,091
Now... Now... Now you run.

722
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:19,429
There you go.

723
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:23,600
And then catch it like that.
So I want you in groups of three, okay?

724
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:26,061
All right, one, two, three.

725
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:00,596
- Bokke!
- Yes!

726
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:04,016
- Bokke!
- Yes, yes, yes!

727
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:28,457
And in addition
to the nationwide PR campaign...

728
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:33,295
...we propose that all retail outlets
charge a nominal fee for plastic bags.

729
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:36,214
- We believe that this will generate...
- Excuse me.

730
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:40,469
Mr. Minister, if you will forgive me,
this all sounds excellent...

731
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:46,308
...and we will return to it, but if you
will indulge me for just one moment.

732
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:49,728
Well, soccer is usually
their favorite sport here...

733
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:54,733
...but things changed today when a group of
local kids really took to the Springboks...

734
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,781
...in a surprise visit
where FranÃ§ois Pienaar...

735
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:04,242
You see that? That picture
is worth any number of speeches.

736
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:09,665
This is part of President Mandela's
"one team, one country" campaign.

737
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:30,268
This is Johan de Villiers
reporting live from Cape Town Airport...

738
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:32,562
...where the Springbok flight
has just landed.

739
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:34,570
- Thank you.
DE VILLIERS: The green and gold...

740
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:35,857
...have just one week...

741
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:38,777
...to put the finishing touches
to their grueling training program.

742
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:43,240
And I, for one, must admit
to being cautiously optimistic.

743
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:47,869
I say "cautiously"
because in my humble opinion...

744
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:52,290
...this Springbok team
has been over-practiced on the field...

745
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:54,668
...and overcommitted off it...

746
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:59,464
...which makes beating a powerhouse
Australian side in next week's Cup opener...

747
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:03,427
...a tall order, especially as this is
an inexperienced team...

748
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:06,888
...with a history of coming up short
in big matches.

749
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:09,182
This is Johan de Villiers,
live in Cape Town...

750
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:12,102
...returning you to the studio
in Johannesburg.

751
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:16,982
Thanks, Johan, for the update...
- Around the world, objectively...

752
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:20,485
...what are they saying
about our chances to beat Australia?

753
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:23,655
Everyone thinks they'll beat us,
and if they do...

754
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:28,493
...we'll have to go through England and
the All Blacks just to get to the final.

755
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:33,540
So it is very important
that we beat Australia?

756
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,793
Thank you.

757
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:53,685
Madiba? The cabinet ministers are here
to brief you on the trip to Taiwan.

758
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:55,645
Yes. I'll be right out.

759
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:57,397
Thank you, sir.

760
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,777
One week, boys.

761
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:57,415
We want snipers on top of the stadium
and the surrounding buildings here.

762
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:58,834
No problem.

763
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:01,878
We want those two approaches
completely sanitized.

764
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:03,088
Two approaches?

765
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:06,800
We're not gonna decide which way
he comes in until the very last moment.

766
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:12,097
We want uniforms, plain-clothes,
sharpshooters.

767
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:13,431
And sniffer dogs.

768
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:17,102
If you need more men, we have an
army unit for you on standby at Silvermine.

769
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:20,522
We're not going to
take chances, gentlemen.

770
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,233
The president is going to be exposed.

771
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:26,194
Much too exposed.

772
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:38,290
Brenda...

773
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:41,501
...I have been studying.

774
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:45,046
For the summit in Taiwan? Good.

775
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:48,049
No. Not exactly.

776
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:49,885
Test me.

777
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:52,971
They look like thugs.

778
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:57,976
Block out their names.
See if I can recognize them.

779
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:05,650
AndrÃ© Joubert. Gavin Johnson.

780
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:08,320
Did I get them right?

781
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:10,488
Yes, Madiba.

782
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:14,326
That's the way I used to study
in law school.

783
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:19,748
Unfortunately, Chester is far too easy
to identify.

784
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:24,586
But that will change. It must.

785
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,309
Team meeting after dinner.

786
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:41,019
FranÃ§ois!

787
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:43,772
Good luck, Springboks!

788
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:55,241
All right, gather around.

789
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:59,120
- Pass them around.
- What's this, homework?

790
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:00,580
Yeah, yeah. A little.

791
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:02,874
Make sure everyone's got one.

792
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:06,252
What is this?

793
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:09,798
Right. We need to learn this song.
We can't just mouth the words anymore.

794
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:12,258
Nobody cares as long as
we're winning the matches.

795
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:14,302
You're wrong, they do care.

796
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,680
It's their bloody song, not ours.

797
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:20,558
- Flipping terrorist song, man.
- They used to arrest you for singing it.

798
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:22,560
Right, and now it's one of our anthems.

799
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:25,855
I can't even read it
or pronounce the words.

800
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:31,569
All right, okes, it's optional.
Take it if you want to.

801
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:41,997
It means "God Bless Africa."

802
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:48,169
Which, you have to admit, we could use.

803
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:04,853
Tell us, Mr. President,
have you always been a rugby fan?

804
01:07:05,479 --> 01:07:10,400
People don't realize
that I played rugby myself...

805
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:13,570
...when I was a student at Fort Hare.

806
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:17,741
It is a very rough game,
almost as rough as politics.

807
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:22,287
How do you think the Springboks
will do?

808
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:24,831
I think they will do very well.

809
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:27,792
Their level of commitment is tremendous.

810
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:32,172
Now, it's been said
that you used to support any team...

811
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:34,299
...that played against the Springboks.

812
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:37,510
Yes, well,
obviously that is no longer true.

813
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:40,722
I am 100 percent behind our boys.

814
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:46,061
After all, if I cannot change
when circumstances demand it...

815
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:49,147
...how can I expect others to?

816
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:44,035
- FranÃ§ois.
- Welcome, Mr. President.

817
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:45,870
Gentlemen.

818
01:08:46,038 --> 01:08:50,708
Forgive me for interrupting your work
the day before such an important match.

819
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:56,339
But I just wanted to come
and wish you good luck in person.

820
01:08:56,507 --> 01:09:02,929
Sometimes, very seldom, as president,
I am allowed to do what I want.

821
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:08,059
- Mr. President. This is...
- I know who this is.

822
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:10,770
- AndrÃ©. Good luck.
- Pleased to meet you. Thank you, sir.

823
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:13,439
- Brendan. Good luck to you.
- Mr. President.

824
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:15,066
- Gavin.
- Mr. President.

825
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:17,277
- Good luck. James.
- Mr. President.

826
01:09:17,444 --> 01:09:18,486
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

827
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:19,988
- Japie.
- Thanks, sir.

828
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:21,364
Good luck.

829
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:24,450
- Did you ever imagine this?
Good luck.

830
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:26,077
How could I?

831
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:28,746
- It's an honor, sir.
- Thank you. Good luck.

832
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:30,123
- Mr. President.
- Good luck.

833
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:31,583
Thank you.

834
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:33,376
- Good luck to you.
- Thank you, sir.

835
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:34,919
- Sir.
- Good luck.

836
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:37,255
- Sir.
- Good luck, son.

837
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:38,590
Good luck.

838
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:40,425
- Hennie, good luck.
- Sir.

839
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:42,010
But...

840
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:44,762
...where is Chester?

841
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:48,266
He's injured, sir.

842
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:51,853
His hamstring.
We're trying to keep it quiet.

843
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:55,899
Well, will he be out
for the entire tournament?

844
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:00,278
With hamstrings, who knows?

845
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:01,905
We'll miss him.

846
01:10:02,823 --> 01:10:05,283
The whole country will miss him.

847
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:08,119
- Well, gentlemen...
- Mr. President, sir.

848
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:11,623
- Yes, Hennie?
- This is for you from us.

849
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:20,006
I am honored, gentlemen.

850
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:21,925
Truly honored.

851
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:25,011
And you must know that...

852
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:28,932
...your country supports you completely.

853
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:30,975
Good luck to you all.

854
01:10:31,143 --> 01:10:33,478
- Thank you, sir.
- FranÃ§ois, walk with me.

855
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:39,817
I have something for you.

856
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:45,740
It has helped me through the years.

857
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:48,159
I hope it helps you.

858
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:49,994
Thank you, Mr. President.

859
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:52,121
Thank you.

860
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:06,427
It's time for bed, Dada.

861
01:11:07,179 --> 01:11:11,182
I'm going to stay up a while.
The country is excited tonight.

862
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,476
You need to sleep, the doctor said.

863
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:18,314
The doctor has no sense of occasion.

864
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:22,652
A good clearance
from the base of the scrum.

865
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:26,406
A good result here today.

866
01:11:26,573 --> 01:11:29,534
It's perfect conditions
in front of a full house.

867
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:34,330
Strong tackle. Nice offload.

868
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:58,896
Hello.

869
01:11:59,064 --> 01:12:00,940
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

870
01:12:01,108 --> 01:12:04,193
You know what's the best thing
about you being the captain?

871
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:06,237
- The honor?
- No.

872
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:08,990
You don't have to share a room.

873
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:12,285
- No, no, no. I can't, I can't.
- Come on, FranÃ§ois, it's been weeks.

874
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:15,788
I need to be angry. I know, it's working.
I need to be angry tomorrow.

875
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:17,165
What's this?

876
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,751
A poem from the president.

877
01:12:19,918 --> 01:12:22,253
How does a poem help you play rugby?

878
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:26,090
The same way your visit does.
Inspiration.

879
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:41,022
Here we go!

880
01:12:48,655 --> 01:12:50,573
Heads up! Heads up!

881
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:13,137
- What happened?
- We scored.

882
01:13:21,021 --> 01:13:22,647
Come on!

883
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:43,626
Try, Australia.

884
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:57,348
Yes.

885
01:13:57,516 --> 01:13:59,016
Number 10, Stransky.

886
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:14,198
Yes! Yes!

887
01:14:14,366 --> 01:14:17,618
- We won.
- We did?

888
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:19,787
Good, Dada.

889
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:45,354
- Very good.
- It's beautiful, Dada.

890
01:14:45,522 --> 01:14:48,316
- Well, then, what do you say now?
- Well, that was fantastic.

891
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,756
You must be very happy.

892
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:15,885
Any man would be happy dancing
with a beautiful lady like you.

893
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:21,182
- Mr. President, you're exaggerating.
- Not at all.

894
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:25,520
My father was Xhosa,
so he was a polygamist.

895
01:15:26,271 --> 01:15:28,272
As you know, I am not.

896
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:33,444
But when I look at you, I envy my father.

897
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:06,143
Here's to Joel, he's so blue

898
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:09,897
He's a drunkard through and through

899
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:13,150
He's a bastard, so they say

900
01:16:13,318 --> 01:16:16,237
He tried to go to heaven
But he went the other way

901
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:20,992
Say one, two, three, four, hey!

902
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:28,583
Coach's run, 6 a.m.

903
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:31,460
- What?
- Pass it on.

904
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:35,881
- Coach's run, 6 a.m.You gotta be kidding
me.

905
01:16:36,049 --> 01:16:39,677
- Six. Drink up.
- Nothing more for you then.

906
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:44,181
Joel, coach's run, 6. Six a.m.

907
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:24,388
Hey, guys. I hope you're
not going to be this slow next week.

908
01:17:25,432 --> 01:17:27,767
- Hi, Nooks.
- Cappie, what's going on?

909
01:17:27,934 --> 01:17:30,019
- A change of pace. Come.
- You sneaky bugger.

910
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:33,356
Here you go. Come on, guys. Come.

911
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,861
They used to smuggle gravel
in from the yard...

912
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:23,739
...throw it across the floor.
They could hear the wardens coming.

913
01:18:23,907 --> 01:18:25,908
Wow.

914
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:30,287
- Can we see the president's cell?
- Yes. Yes, of course.

915
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:33,958
Lord, can you believe this?

916
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:39,004
Now, the number on the door, 46664...

917
01:18:39,172 --> 01:18:44,468
...means he was the 466th prisoner
to be interned here in 1964.

918
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:47,722
We've done it up just the way it was.

919
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:56,105
Come with me.

920
01:19:34,686 --> 01:19:37,188
Out of the night that covers me

921
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:40,858
Black as the Pit from pole to pole

922
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:45,321
I thank whatever gods may be

923
01:19:45,697 --> 01:19:48,032
For my unconquerable soul.

924
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:51,827
In the fell clutch of circumstance

925
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:57,458
I have not winced nor cried aloud.

926
01:19:58,043 --> 01:20:00,377
Under the bludgeonings of fate

927
01:20:01,254 --> 01:20:05,174
My head is bloody, but unbowed.

928
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:10,721
Beyond this place of wrath and tears

929
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:14,391
Looms but the Horror of the shade

930
01:20:19,147 --> 01:20:22,066
And yet the menace of the years

931
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:28,989
Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.

932
01:20:31,034 --> 01:20:34,078
It matters not how strait the gate

933
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:37,581
How charged with punishment the scroll

934
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:41,043
I am the master of my fate:

935
01:20:43,421 --> 01:20:46,632
I am the captain of my soul.

936
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:01,230
Over there.

937
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:24,086
Dada? Madiba?

938
01:21:24,254 --> 01:21:25,796
Sir?

939
01:21:31,636 --> 01:21:32,803
What happened?

940
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:36,599
It's simple exhaustion, but it will lead
to worse if it's not treated.

941
01:21:36,766 --> 01:21:38,601
He needs a complete rest.

942
01:21:38,768 --> 01:21:42,938
And I don't mean just simply shifting
the affairs of the state to his bedroom.

943
01:21:43,106 --> 01:21:45,566
No phone calls, no visitors,
no meetings, no politics.

944
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:47,359
You know him, he won't do that.

945
01:21:47,527 --> 01:21:51,697
- Then I'm going to put him in isolation.
- Not yet. I'll threaten him with hospital...

946
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:54,283
...if he doesn't behave.
- I'll cancel everything.

947
01:21:54,451 --> 01:21:57,244
And I'll come back tonight
to make sure he's not working.

948
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:04,251
Don't cancel the trip to Taiwan, not yet.

949
01:22:21,019 --> 01:22:22,853
Chester's back.

950
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:25,147
Okay, back to the line.

951
01:22:51,341 --> 01:22:53,884
Try to South Africa
scored by Chester Williams.

952
01:23:19,869 --> 01:23:21,328
All right.

953
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:42,391
Fuck you, pussy.

954
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:49,398
Ball's trapped, green put-in.

955
01:23:54,738 --> 01:23:59,616
Game over. Final score:
South Africa, 42, Samoa, 14.

956
01:24:02,537 --> 01:24:05,789
Bokke! Bokke! Bokke!

957
01:24:13,965 --> 01:24:15,382
Madiba?

958
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:18,886
- This is the delegation that you have been...
- I know who this is.

959
01:24:19,763 --> 01:24:22,473
Welcome. Thank you for coming
so far to see me.

960
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:23,932
Thank you. How do you do?

961
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:25,976
- I'm fine. Welcome.
- Thank you very much.

962
01:24:26,144 --> 01:24:29,480
Ladies and gentlemen,
we apologize for the rain delay.

963
01:24:29,647 --> 01:24:34,318
The semifinal match between South Africa
and France will begin as soon as possible.

964
01:24:37,447 --> 01:24:40,365
- This is it, let's go. Let's go!

965
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:44,453
Expect it to grow faster
than other sectors in the next few years.

966
01:24:44,621 --> 01:24:46,497
Manufacturing accounts for 40...

967
01:25:28,456 --> 01:25:30,958
To promote
our international business alliances.

968
01:25:31,417 --> 01:25:34,878
Strong industries have developed
in shipping and computers.

969
01:25:35,046 --> 01:25:38,048
- Our information...
- Please, excuse me.

970
01:25:38,216 --> 01:25:40,759
Yes, Mr. President, of course.

971
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:46,557
Gentlemen, let us continue
in 10 minutes.

972
01:25:49,727 --> 01:25:52,062
This is good, very good.

973
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:54,565
So who is our next opponent?

974
01:25:54,732 --> 01:25:57,568
The All Blacks play England tomorrow.
Then we'll know.

975
01:25:57,735 --> 01:25:58,986
I see.

976
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:03,365
Well, you will make sure that
my schedule is free for the entire match.

977
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:04,867
Yes, Dada.

978
01:26:05,034 --> 01:26:08,579
This is good. This is very good.

979
01:26:16,337 --> 01:26:17,838
Brilliant.

980
01:26:18,047 --> 01:26:21,216
Look at the power of that man.
There he goes. Two.

981
01:26:23,052 --> 01:26:25,512
- Cheers, mate.
- Beautiful try.

982
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:30,058
His All Black teammates come
to congratulate the big fella yet again.

983
01:26:30,226 --> 01:26:32,769
Lomu is becoming
one of the most intimidating...

984
01:26:32,937 --> 01:26:35,522
Why don't we do a little work
while we're here?

985
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:39,776
Just enjoy the rugby.

986
01:26:39,944 --> 01:26:42,529
- World Cup semifinal against England.

987
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:45,407
Good clearance from the base
of the scrum.

988
01:26:45,575 --> 01:26:47,201
So let me understand this.

989
01:26:47,368 --> 01:26:50,120
The All Blacks are killing a team
that trashed us last year.

990
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:51,914
- Thanks for reminding me.
- Yes.

991
01:26:57,462 --> 01:26:59,880
- And he is...
- We're gonna really have to tackle...

992
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:02,466
...a lot better than the English.
- Yeah. For sure.

993
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:03,717
- We do.
- For sure, yeah.

994
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:06,929
That is Lomu's second try this afternoon.

995
01:27:07,096 --> 01:27:10,057
This guy really likes scoring tries
against the English...

996
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:13,810
Are those the judicial appointments
for the Free States?

997
01:27:13,978 --> 01:27:16,480
They'll keep until after the match.

998
01:27:19,025 --> 01:27:20,817
There's the kick.

999
01:27:21,402 --> 01:27:24,029
I am the president, you know.

1000
01:27:24,781 --> 01:27:27,824
And the conversion is good.

1001
01:27:28,409 --> 01:27:31,995
Are you watching this guy?
He's about your size, but...

1002
01:27:32,163 --> 01:27:35,499
- How much does this Lomu guy weigh?
About 120 kilos.

1003
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:37,709
Shit. It's the same as me.

1004
01:27:37,877 --> 01:27:40,045
Yeah, but you're slow.

1005
01:27:42,173 --> 01:27:44,508
Lomu looks for contact
every time he gets the ball.

1006
01:27:44,676 --> 01:27:46,134
- Yep.
- That's good for us.

1007
01:27:46,302 --> 01:27:47,344
Yep.

1008
01:27:47,512 --> 01:27:52,641
I will break my arm, my leg, my neck,
but I will not let that freaking guy go.

1009
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:54,810
Me too, cappie. Me too.

1010
01:27:54,978 --> 01:27:57,521
- With you, cappie. With you.
- All the way.

1011
01:27:58,898 --> 01:28:01,316
A lot of pushing in the lineup over there.

1012
01:28:01,693 --> 01:28:03,318
Players jostling for position.

1013
01:28:03,486 --> 01:28:06,029
Try to spin it when you pass it, yeah?
Like this:

1014
01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:14,371
Yes.No.

1015
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:15,998
Touch.

1016
01:28:16,374 --> 01:28:18,125
You must fly in there.

1017
01:28:18,293 --> 01:28:21,837
Still think I'm wasting my time
with the rugby?

1018
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:31,221
- He's in the clear and he will go...
Brenda.

1019
01:28:32,515 --> 01:28:34,224
Please tell the minister of sport...

1020
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:38,228
...I would like a full report
on the All Blacks.

1021
01:28:38,563 --> 01:28:40,230
This rugby.

1022
01:28:40,398 --> 01:28:41,898
It's still strictly political?

1023
01:28:42,066 --> 01:28:44,901
Yes. Yes. Of course.

1024
01:28:48,906 --> 01:28:50,907
- And over the try line as well.

1025
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,743
- Sweetheart.
- Hello.

1026
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:55,078
- Hello, Nerine.
- FranÃ§ois.

1027
01:28:58,916 --> 01:29:02,753
- Don't lose them, won't be able to get more.
- Thanks, FranÃ§ois.

1028
01:29:03,212 --> 01:29:05,881
Me, Mum, Nerine.

1029
01:29:06,049 --> 01:29:08,425
Wait, there's a fourth.

1030
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:09,843
Who's that for?

1031
01:29:28,654 --> 01:29:32,157
The All Blacks beat Ireland 43 to 19.

1032
01:29:32,325 --> 01:29:35,994
- I see.
- They beat Wales 34 to 9.

1033
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:40,957
- I see.
- They beat Japan 145 to 17.

1034
01:29:41,125 --> 01:29:44,336
A hundred and forty-five points?
In one match?

1035
01:29:44,504 --> 01:29:46,880
It's a new international record.

1036
01:29:47,465 --> 01:29:50,926
They beat Scotland 48 to 30
in the quarterfinals.

1037
01:29:51,094 --> 01:29:54,388
- You saw the match with England.
- Yes.

1038
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:59,434
Forty-five to 29,
and it was not that close.

1039
01:30:00,144 --> 01:30:02,312
They seem unstoppable.

1040
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:06,942
If the opposing team played them
straight up, Jonah Lomu runs wild.

1041
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:10,153
If they focus on Lomu,
that leaves others free.

1042
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:12,697
And also,
there's the business of the haka.

1043
01:30:12,865 --> 01:30:18,161
A Maori war dance.
Yes. It is very powerful.

1044
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:22,874
My sources tell me that
half of the All Black matches...

1045
01:30:23,042 --> 01:30:26,169
...are won before the first whistle
because of it.

1046
01:30:26,712 --> 01:30:29,005
How can we beat them?

1047
01:30:29,173 --> 01:30:32,843
I have the coach's number.
Maybe you could call him and ask.

1048
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:39,057
No, no, I don't want to distract
their focus, even for one minute.

1049
01:30:39,684 --> 01:30:42,477
But how can we win?

1050
01:30:42,645 --> 01:30:46,481
Maybe we won't. They're favored 2-to-1.

1051
01:30:46,649 --> 01:30:51,403
Madiba, we have already exceeded
all expectations, on and off the field.

1052
01:30:51,571 --> 01:30:56,700
It's not enough. Not now. Not so close.

1053
01:30:57,702 --> 01:31:02,122
This country is hungry for greatness.

1054
01:31:21,559 --> 01:31:23,852
Brought one of your mum's
protein shakes.

1055
01:31:29,567 --> 01:31:31,568
Thinking about tomorrow?

1056
01:31:32,236 --> 01:31:33,904
No.

1057
01:31:34,238 --> 01:31:39,201
Tomorrow's taken care of,
one way or another.

1058
01:31:40,828 --> 01:31:46,082
I was thinking about how you
spend 30 years in a tiny cell...

1059
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:51,505
...and come out ready to forgive
the people who put you there.

1060
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:02,891
Come on, man.
There's nothing more you can do today.

1061
01:32:07,271 --> 01:32:09,439
Have I ever mentioned to you
that I hate rugby?

1062
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:12,442
Once or twice. Yes.

1063
01:32:15,696 --> 01:32:19,741
I just wanna get him through
tomorrow safely, that's all.

1064
01:32:20,451 --> 01:32:22,327
We all do.

1065
01:32:48,479 --> 01:32:52,232
The tickets sold out long before
the team became popular.

1066
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:56,903
There's not exactly going to be
the rainbow nation out there.

1067
01:32:57,071 --> 01:32:59,281
And that's the reality.

1068
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:04,995
Now, all it takes is one idiot
trying to make a statement...

1069
01:33:05,162 --> 01:33:09,958
...or one fool who thinks that he hears God
speaking to him through the radio.

1070
01:33:10,418 --> 01:33:14,129
It has happened before, but not today.

1071
01:33:14,297 --> 01:33:18,800
Not on our watch and not today.

1072
01:33:58,841 --> 01:34:02,218
- Flag face, 5 rand. Flag face.
- Bugger off.

1073
01:34:02,386 --> 01:34:03,803
It's all right.

1074
01:34:08,434 --> 01:34:11,061
We are at Ellis Park on
this historic day...

1075
01:34:11,228 --> 01:34:16,566
...where even this early,
crowd expectation is at fever pitch...

1076
01:34:17,151 --> 01:34:20,070
...because their beloved
green and gold...

1077
01:34:20,237 --> 01:34:24,074
...has somehow managed
to defy all expectations.

1078
01:34:24,241 --> 01:34:29,079
But now, they come up against a team
unlike any they have placed before.

1079
01:34:29,747 --> 01:34:34,876
These All Blacks are possibly one
of the greatest international sides ever...

1080
01:34:35,044 --> 01:34:37,253
...with a player in Jonah Lomu...

1081
01:34:37,421 --> 01:34:41,758
...who is as dominant as any
this correspondent has ever seen.

1082
01:34:54,605 --> 01:34:56,106
Madiba!

1083
01:34:56,273 --> 01:34:57,774
Madiba! Madiba!

1084
01:34:57,942 --> 01:34:59,776
Madiba!

1085
01:35:12,081 --> 01:35:15,583
Bokke! Bokke! Bokke!

1086
01:35:48,451 --> 01:35:50,535
Final approach, captain.

1087
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:54,831
Let it be noted that
I'm taking control of the aircraft.

1088
01:35:55,332 --> 01:35:57,292
Duly noted.

1089
01:35:58,127 --> 01:36:01,337
I take full responsibility
for what happens from now on.

1090
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:24,194
Do you see that jet to the east?

1091
01:36:26,405 --> 01:36:29,532
They get clearance for this?
- Not from us.

1092
01:36:32,328 --> 01:36:33,369
Where is he?

1093
01:36:33,996 --> 01:36:35,455
VIP box.

1094
01:36:35,623 --> 01:36:37,332
Let's get him out of there now.

1095
01:36:38,125 --> 01:36:40,043
No time.

1096
01:37:05,194 --> 01:37:06,236
What the hell was that?

1097
01:37:48,988 --> 01:37:51,114
- Bokke!
- Yes!

1098
01:37:51,323 --> 01:37:52,699
Come on.

1099
01:38:25,858 --> 01:38:28,943
Welcome to Ellis Park, Johannesburg...

1100
01:38:29,111 --> 01:38:32,739
...and the 1995 Rugby World Cup Final.

1101
01:38:47,546 --> 01:38:51,174
Please welcome
the South African Springboks.

1102
01:39:01,518 --> 01:39:04,938
Bokke! Bokke! Bokke!

1103
01:39:05,564 --> 01:39:07,857
And the New Zealand All Blacks.

1104
01:39:08,025 --> 01:39:10,193
All Blacks! All Blacks! All Blacks!

1105
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:48,856
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome...

1106
01:39:49,024 --> 01:39:55,029
...the president of the Republic
of South Africa, Mr. Nelson Mandela.

1107
01:40:05,416 --> 01:40:07,834
Dr. Nelson Mandela,
the president of South Africa...

1108
01:40:08,002 --> 01:40:10,753
...in the rugby jersey
with a Number 6 on its back.

1109
01:40:11,839 --> 01:40:13,923
The All Blacks won't like that.

1110
01:40:15,968 --> 01:40:19,679
FranÃ§ois, your country
is very proud of you.

1111
01:40:19,847 --> 01:40:20,888
Thank you, sir.

1112
01:40:21,056 --> 01:40:23,224
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1113
01:40:23,392 --> 01:40:25,101
- This is Ruben Kruger.
- Mr. President.

1114
01:40:25,269 --> 01:40:28,438
- Hi. Good luck to you, son.
- Thank you.

1115
01:40:28,814 --> 01:40:29,856
Good luck to you, son.

1116
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:37,280
The dignities out there
with Dr. Mandela...

1117
01:40:38,532 --> 01:40:39,949
Chester.

1118
01:40:40,117 --> 01:40:43,703
I want you to know that
your whole country is supporting you.

1119
01:40:43,954 --> 01:40:46,789
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

1120
01:40:46,957 --> 01:40:48,082
Good luck, son.

1121
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:50,209
What dramatic moments here
at Ellis Park.

1122
01:40:50,377 --> 01:40:53,629
I don't think I've ever seen
so many flags in one stadium.

1123
01:41:03,015 --> 01:41:04,640
- Hi.
- Our captain.

1124
01:41:04,808 --> 01:41:05,808
An honor, sir.

1125
01:41:09,813 --> 01:41:11,230
- Mr. President.
- Good luck.

1126
01:41:11,398 --> 01:41:13,316
- Jonah.
- Good afternoon, sir.

1127
01:41:13,484 --> 01:41:14,859
- Nice to see you.
- Thank you.

1128
01:41:15,027 --> 01:41:17,236
I'm a little afraid of you.

1129
01:41:17,404 --> 01:41:20,073
And that's big Jonah LomuV
a big day for him.

1130
01:41:23,118 --> 01:41:24,911
- You all be careful now.
- Yeah.

1131
01:41:25,079 --> 01:41:26,829
Good luck.

1132
01:41:27,706 --> 01:41:31,793
Nelson! Nelson! Nelson!

1133
01:41:39,009 --> 01:41:43,846
Dr. Mandela just lifting his cap
to the 62,000 people...

1134
01:41:46,308 --> 01:41:48,017
Eunice!

1135
01:41:59,696 --> 01:42:04,283
Wonderful aerial shot
of Ellis Park Stadium.

1136
01:42:08,539 --> 01:42:11,874
A very emotional moment for both teams.

1137
01:42:30,269 --> 01:42:35,064
Ladies and gentlemen,
the national anthem of South Africa.

1138
01:42:36,108 --> 01:42:38,568
South African national anthems.

1139
01:43:09,558 --> 01:43:13,853
What an unbelievable spectacular here
in Johannesburg.

1140
01:44:06,615 --> 01:44:09,283
The match will now begin.

1141
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:21,671
All right.

1142
01:44:25,926 --> 01:44:29,679
Perhaps we should make a little wager.

1143
01:44:30,514 --> 01:44:33,015
All your gold for all our sheep.

1144
01:44:34,851 --> 01:44:40,398
Well, I was thinking
more along the lines of a case of wine.

1145
01:44:43,151 --> 01:44:44,527
The celebration's over.

1146
01:44:44,695 --> 01:44:49,031
We're now down to the big game
and we await the haka of New Zealand.

1147
01:45:30,907 --> 01:45:34,744
Well, that's the challenge that's laid down
by the Maoris before going into battle.

1148
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:52,011
Outside, outside!

1149
01:45:57,434 --> 01:46:00,234
New Zealand with the best
attacking side of the tournament.

1150
01:46:17,871 --> 01:46:20,351
This first 20 minutes
will be absolutely critical.

1151
01:46:20,499 --> 01:46:22,917
South Africa has the weight advantage
in the scrums...

1152
01:46:23,085 --> 01:46:26,045
...but I don't think many people have
seen a weak New Zealand scrum.

1153
01:46:36,681 --> 01:46:38,307
Put it out!

1154
01:46:40,435 --> 01:46:43,270
South Africa had it in the maul
and they should've played it.

1155
01:46:43,438 --> 01:46:46,482
Good interplay by New Zealand.
Now, here's a chance for them.

1156
01:46:52,072 --> 01:46:53,656
Engage.

1157
01:46:54,866 --> 01:46:56,367
Break.

1158
01:47:05,001 --> 01:47:06,710
Come, boys.

1159
01:47:07,587 --> 01:47:09,130
What the heck are we doing?

1160
01:47:09,297 --> 01:47:11,006
Lomu is culling us.

1161
01:47:11,174 --> 01:47:14,552
Forwards, we must start scrumming.

1162
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:18,514
We must disrupt him at the first phase.
Can't allow Lomu to get the ball in space.

1163
01:47:18,682 --> 01:47:19,932
He's freaking killing us.

1164
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:23,519
But listen, if Lomu gets the ball,
whoever's there...

1165
01:47:23,687 --> 01:47:25,646
...James, Joost...

1166
01:47:25,814 --> 01:47:28,149
...hit the fucking guy,
hold onto him, hold him.

1167
01:47:28,316 --> 01:47:30,151
Help will come, help will be there.

1168
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:34,530
We can see that New Zealand
were looking to try...

1169
01:47:34,698 --> 01:47:38,701
...and stretch the game to the left to Jonah
Lomu, and give him some time and space.

1170
01:48:16,573 --> 01:48:19,033
Most of the opportunities
have gone New Zealand's way.

1171
01:48:19,493 --> 01:48:21,619
Now, now, now!

1172
01:48:29,794 --> 01:48:32,421
Penalty. Carrying the ball.

1173
01:48:36,092 --> 01:48:37,593
That's the mark.

1174
01:48:37,761 --> 01:48:40,429
Captain. Posts.

1175
01:48:47,521 --> 01:48:50,272
Kick is good.
Number 10, Andrew Mehrtens.

1176
01:48:50,524 --> 01:48:52,691
First blood to New Zealand.

1177
01:48:53,026 --> 01:48:55,152
Great all-around fly half
is Andrew Mehrtens...

1178
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:58,364
...born here in South Africa in Durban.

1179
01:49:09,584 --> 01:49:13,712
And now Stransky gets a kick that's every bit
as important as the one that Mehrtens...

1180
01:49:22,722 --> 01:49:24,890
The kick is good.
Number 10, Joel Stransky.

1181
01:49:28,144 --> 01:49:30,062
New Zealand to restart.

1182
01:50:00,677 --> 01:50:03,012
Penalty. Carrying the ball.

1183
01:50:03,179 --> 01:50:04,513
Posts.

1184
01:50:08,310 --> 01:50:10,269
Such an important kick for New Zealand.

1185
01:50:16,443 --> 01:50:20,362
The penalty kick is converted.
Andrew Mehrtens for New Zealand.

1186
01:50:20,530 --> 01:50:25,034
The score now:
New Zealand, 6, South Africa, 3.

1187
01:50:25,201 --> 01:50:27,703
It's a great kick from Mehrtens.
Thirteen minutes gone.

1188
01:50:27,871 --> 01:50:30,706
They're at 6 points to 3,
New Zealand leads South Africa.

1189
01:50:37,714 --> 01:50:39,274
Release the ball. Come on.

1190
01:50:54,522 --> 01:50:58,734
About 21 minutes gone.
Both teams, up on it, 6 points each.

1191
01:51:18,838 --> 01:51:21,924
Boks kick a goal for the lead
for the first time in the match.

1192
01:51:53,206 --> 01:51:54,623
Last feet.

1193
01:51:54,791 --> 01:51:57,626
Stay. Stay.

1194
01:52:04,467 --> 01:52:06,802
Successful attempt for New Zealand.

1195
01:52:08,638 --> 01:52:10,639
Wide, wide!

1196
01:52:41,171 --> 01:52:45,007
Unsuccessful kick. The score remains 9-9.

1197
01:52:45,383 --> 01:52:48,385
That's the closing score, 9 points all.

1198
01:52:48,553 --> 01:52:51,138
And now there will be
a five-minute break.

1199
01:52:51,514 --> 01:52:55,517
This is the first final in the history of the
World Cup where we're having extra time.

1200
01:52:58,438 --> 01:53:00,397
Extra time.

1201
01:53:00,940 --> 01:53:03,484
So, what does this mean?

1202
01:53:03,651 --> 01:53:06,528
Extra time. Twenty minutes.

1203
01:53:07,197 --> 01:53:09,364
I don't think I can take it.

1204
01:53:09,532 --> 01:53:14,703
It'll be a test of great character
in these last 20 minutes of this match.

1205
01:53:16,122 --> 01:53:22,044
Who's the fittest team on this field?

1206
01:53:32,680 --> 01:53:34,890
Outside, outside!

1207
01:53:41,898 --> 01:53:44,733
Crouch. Engage!

1208
01:53:46,778 --> 01:53:48,362
Break.

1209
01:54:03,294 --> 01:54:04,920
Penalty.

1210
01:54:19,269 --> 01:54:22,521
New Zealand, 12, South Africa, 9.

1211
01:54:22,689 --> 01:54:24,731
A great kick from Andrew Mehrtens.

1212
01:54:24,899 --> 01:54:27,943
Well, he certainly had length in reserve...

1213
01:54:28,111 --> 01:54:31,196
...because it was high, high
above the crossbar...

1214
01:54:46,462 --> 01:54:48,797
Penalty against green.

1215
01:54:52,135 --> 01:54:53,302
Time off.

1216
01:54:53,469 --> 01:54:56,013
- Five minutes, sir.
- FranÃ§ois.

1217
01:54:57,682 --> 01:55:00,309
Too many guys off their feet at the rucks.

1218
01:55:00,476 --> 01:55:02,269
- Okay.
- Speak to your team.

1219
01:55:02,437 --> 01:55:04,104
- I'll talk to them. Speak to them.
- Yes.

1220
01:55:05,565 --> 01:55:06,815
Switch to Jonah Lomu.

1221
01:55:06,983 --> 01:55:10,444
Big man's been quiet in this match
and that's credit to South Africa's...

1222
01:55:10,820 --> 01:55:12,362
Heads up.

1223
01:55:12,530 --> 01:55:14,573
Look in my eyes.

1224
01:55:15,074 --> 01:55:16,658
Do you hear?

1225
01:55:16,826 --> 01:55:18,869
Listen to your country.

1226
01:55:19,037 --> 01:55:20,579
Seven minutes.

1227
01:55:20,872 --> 01:55:23,832
Seven minutes.
Defense, defense, defense.

1228
01:55:24,208 --> 01:55:25,667
This is it.

1229
01:55:25,835 --> 01:55:27,628
This is our destiny.

1230
01:55:27,795 --> 01:55:29,588
- Come, Bokke! Come!
- Yeah!

1231
01:55:29,756 --> 01:55:31,381
Come on!

1232
01:55:34,802 --> 01:55:36,929
How long before the end?

1233
01:55:37,096 --> 01:55:39,848
- Seven minutes.
- Seven minutes.

1234
01:55:40,016 --> 01:55:42,351
New Zealand leads by 12 points to 9.

1235
01:55:42,518 --> 01:55:45,479
This will be the longest seven minutes
that those 15...

1236
01:56:06,834 --> 01:56:09,086
Spin, spin!

1237
01:56:26,354 --> 01:56:30,357
Yes! Yes, Bokke!

1238
01:56:30,525 --> 01:56:34,361
Stransky, this time, has got this kick
of immense importance for his country.

1239
01:56:44,330 --> 01:56:45,706
Yeah.

1240
01:56:54,716 --> 01:56:56,883
Five minutes in extra playing time.

1241
01:57:03,266 --> 01:57:05,058
Now, now!

1242
01:57:45,975 --> 01:57:48,477
And that is the way
one can get a big man coming...

1243
01:57:57,111 --> 01:57:58,653
Joost!

1244
01:58:12,627 --> 01:58:13,668
And squeeze.

1245
01:58:20,510 --> 01:58:22,636
Joost!

1246
01:58:49,872 --> 01:58:50,872
Has he got it?

1247
01:59:00,466 --> 01:59:06,555
With minutes remaining,
South Africa takes the lead, 15 to 12.

1248
01:59:06,722 --> 01:59:07,889
Yes!

1249
01:59:16,065 --> 01:59:17,899
Fifteen points to 12.

1250
01:59:18,067 --> 01:59:19,901
South Africa!

1251
01:59:34,750 --> 01:59:36,042
Ellis on the outside.

1252
01:59:36,252 --> 01:59:40,172
Great play here by Marc Ellis
in reading the game, but he can't take...

1253
01:59:41,757 --> 01:59:44,259
South Africa will have go into the scrum...

1254
01:59:54,854 --> 01:59:56,438
Drive!

1255
02:00:56,165 --> 02:00:57,582
They've won!

1256
02:00:57,750 --> 02:01:00,001
- Yes!
- Yeah!

1257
02:01:07,468 --> 02:01:09,678
Yes!

1258
02:01:56,142 --> 02:01:58,560
Chester, will you lead us in a prayer?

1259
02:01:59,312 --> 02:02:01,855
Thanks, Lord,
for getting us into this final.

1260
02:02:02,023 --> 02:02:04,065
Thanks for no serious injuries.

1261
02:02:04,233 --> 02:02:07,235
And most of all,
thanks for the win. Amen.

1262
02:02:07,403 --> 02:02:09,070
Amen.

1263
02:02:16,954 --> 02:02:18,580
Good game.

1264
02:02:19,665 --> 02:02:21,833
Marvelous. Marvelous.

1265
02:02:25,755 --> 02:02:27,255
Good job.

1266
02:03:43,374 --> 02:03:46,543
FranÃ§ois, a few words.

1267
02:03:46,877 --> 02:03:48,002
Great game.

1268
02:03:48,170 --> 02:03:50,964
But you couldn't have done it
without the amazing support...

1269
02:03:51,132 --> 02:03:54,384
...of 63,000 South Africans here today.

1270
02:03:54,552 --> 02:03:58,179
Yeah. We didn't have the support
of 60,000 South Africans.

1271
02:03:58,347 --> 02:04:01,516
We had the support
of 43 million South Africans.

1272
02:04:16,866 --> 02:04:19,826
I want to thank you
for what you have done for our country.

1273
02:04:20,369 --> 02:04:24,122
No, Mr. President, thank you
for what you have done for our country.

1274
02:05:42,618 --> 02:05:45,537
Yeah, it's beautiful, it's beautiful,
it's beautiful.

1275
02:05:59,468 --> 02:06:02,512
This route is crowded.
Let's change to route C.

1276
02:06:02,680 --> 02:06:03,721
Okay.

1277
02:06:05,891 --> 02:06:10,436
There's no hurry here. No hurry at all.

1278
02:06:12,022 --> 02:06:14,983
Madiba says there's no need to hurry.

1279
02:06:17,152 --> 02:06:18,570
Yeah.

1280
02:06:21,323 --> 02:06:24,492
It's good, it's good, it's good.

1281
02:06:25,411 --> 02:06:28,663
I thank whatever gods may be

1282
02:06:28,914 --> 02:06:32,000
For my unconquerable soul.

1283
02:06:32,167 --> 02:06:35,128
I am the master of my fate:

1284
02:06:35,421 --> 02:06:38,339
I am the captain of my soul.
