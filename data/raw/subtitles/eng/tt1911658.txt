Well, I figured if we could
reverse the ray...

1411
01:10:00,572 --> 01:10:02,781

everyone back to normal.

1415

we would need to
replace the Medusa Serum...

01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:40,692
No, no.

1584
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:45,113
I want to say, you four
are the bravest agents
I have ever known.

1585
01:19:46,532 --> 01:19:47,532
The point is...

1586
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:49,492
I was wrong about you.

1587
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:53,538
And I hope there is some way
I can make it right.

1588
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:55,123
Give us jetpacks?
We should kiss.

1589
01:19:55,207 --> 01:19:57,083
Whoa. Uh...
(CLEARS THROAT)

1590
01:19:57,168 --> 01:19:59,294

1593
01:20:04,383 --> 01:20:05,925
Well, that feels right!

1594
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:08,219
I think I'd actually
prefer a jetpack, please.

1595
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:11,848
Ooh, I think we should
go with Private's idea.

1596
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:13,391
Hmm?

SKIPPER: Yes! (LAUGHING)

1598
01:20:16,854 --> 01:20:18,980
Kowalski,
what's our trajectory?

1599
01:20:19,148 --> 01:20:24,027
95% certain this
will end in massive,
flaming disaster.

1600
01:20:24,195 --> 01:20:25,487
And the other 5%?

1601
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:28,781
Irrelevant, sir.
Jetpacks are awesome!

1602
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:29,991
Agreed.

1603
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:31,826

we are going to turn me
back to normal, right?

1612
01:21:28,676 --> 01:21:30,134
<i>SKIPPER: Absolutely.</i>
First thing, Monday.

1613
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:36,140
Whee! I'm in a rocket ship!

1614
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:37,850
I want to push the button.

1615
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:39,018
Give me that.
Hey.

1616
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:40,478
Stealer!

1617
01:21:40,563 --> 01:21:42,146
Let's do this! I'm ready!

1618
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:44,315
Okay, on three.
One, three, go! Ow!

1619
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:47,235
I'm just going to do
a little practice push.
(GROANS)

1620
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:48,820
Okay, I'm not
going to press it...

1621
01:21:48,988 --> 01:21:51,698
Why are you smacking my hand?
Hey, look over there!

Immeasurable cuteness,
right there.

Good to be back.

Whoa! I'm okay!

And with cuteness to spare.

Frosty mugs of

I expected a little more...
