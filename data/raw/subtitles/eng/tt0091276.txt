THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO          
JUST A ROUTINE SECURITY CHECK   

694
00:58:51,792 --> 00:58:53,927
ON THEIR MEN.                   

695
00:58:53,994 --> 00:58:55,895
DON'T WANT TO MAKE              
AN ISSUE OUT OF THIS.           

696
00:58:55,963 --> 00:58:57,231
                     YES, SIR.

            [Gunshot]

                     GENERAL--

                 KEEP BACK!     

706
01:00:23,333 --> 01:00:25,936
             MY GOD.            

707
01:00:26,003 --> 01:00:28,087
WHAT?                           
         THEY'RE DEAD.          

708
01:00:28,155 --> 01:00:28,956
            JESUS!              

709
01:00:45,974 --> 01:00:46,739
         STAY CLEAR!            

710
01:00:46,807 --> 01:00:52,980
 DON'T TOUCH THOSE THINGS!      

711
01:00:53,047 --> 01:00:54,481
    SEAL THE BASE PERIMETER.

01:00:54,548 --> 01:00:56,516

01:00:56,584 --> 01:00:59,086
     GET THOSE NASA HOTSHOTS    
 BACK OVER HERE RIGHT AWAY.     

714
01:00:59,153 --> 01:01:01,254
        MAYBE THEY CAN          
         EXPLAIN THIS.          

715
01:01:01,322 --> 01:01:03,690
BRING THE NURSE                 
AND THE KID BACK,               
RIGHT NOW!                      

716
01:01:03,757 --> 01:01:05,658
LOCK OFF THE LAUNCH AREA.       
                     YES, SIR.  

717
01:01:30,684 --> 01:01:31,951
             DAVID,             

718
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:33,453
     THIS IS DR. STOUT,         

719
01:01:33,521 --> 01:01:36,089
     SENIOR SCIENTIST ON        
 THE MILLENNIUM PROJECT.        

720
01:01:36,157 --> 01:01:37,457
     THIS IS DR. WEINSTEIN.     

721
01:01:37,525 --> 01:01:38,758
HOW DO YOU DO,                  
DAVID?                          

722
01:01:38,826 --> 01:01:40,793
WE WORK WITH                    
YOUR FATHER.                    

723
01:01:40,861 --> 01:01:43,963
HI, DAVID. YOUR DAD'S TALKED    
ABOUT YOU A LOT.                

724
01:01:44,032 --> 01:01:46,733
 THIS IS LINDA MAGNUSSON,       
     DAVID'S FRIEND.            

725
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:50,037
     DOCTOR, I DIDN'T THINK     
         THE VIKING MISSIONS    

726
01:01:50,104 --> 01:01:51,871
         FOUND ANY SIGN OF LIFE,

727
01:01:51,939 --> 01:01:54,074
         EXCEPT FOR THIS PHOTO  
         I SAW IN A MAGAZINE    

728
01:01:54,142 --> 01:01:56,126
             OF THESE THINGS    
             ON THE SURFACE     

729
01:01:56,194 --> 01:01:58,695
             THAT LOOKED        
             LIKE PYRAMIDS.     

730
01:01:58,762 --> 01:02:00,364
                     I SAW THAT 
                     PHOTOGRAPH.

731
01:02:00,431 --> 01:02:03,533
         AND WHAT ABOUT         
         THAT HUGE THING        

732
01:02:03,601 --> 01:02:06,703
     THAT KIND OF LOOKED        
     LIKE A MONKEY'S HEAD?      

733
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:08,405
     IT WAS IN ALL THE PAPERS.  

734
01:02:08,473 --> 01:02:09,906
        THAT WAS FAKE, RIGHT?   

735
01:02:09,974 --> 01:02:12,342
            ON THE CONTRARY,    
         THERE WERE OTHER PHOTOS

736
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:15,212
             TOO SENSATIONAL    
         TO BE MADE PUBLIC.     

737
01:02:15,279 --> 01:02:17,897
BUT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH WATER    
 TO SUPPORT LIFE.               

738
01:02:17,965 --> 01:02:21,434
ON THE SURFACE.                 
WE'RE LOOKING BELOW GROUND.     

739
01:02:21,502 --> 01:02:22,535
        IF THERE IS,            
         DAVID,                 

740
01:02:22,603 --> 01:02:24,504
     IT MAY NOT WANT            
        TO BE FOUND.            

741
01:02:24,572 --> 01:02:26,573
                    THE TUNNELS!

742
01:02:26,641 --> 01:02:29,041
            IT MAY NOT          
         WANT US UP THERE.      

743
01:02:47,595 --> 01:02:49,862
                 THERE REALLY IS
                NO OTHER CHOICE.

744
01:02:49,931 --> 01:02:53,466
NO, PLEASE, GENERAL WILSON,     
    ANY FURTHER DELAY,          

745
01:02:53,534 --> 01:02:54,801
                WE'LL MISS      
            THE LAUNCH WINDOW.  

746
01:02:54,868 --> 01:02:57,003
                 MARS WON'T WAIT
                FOR US, GENERAL.

747
01:02:57,071 --> 01:02:58,371
     I UNDERSTAND,              
     GENTLEMEN.                 

748
01:02:58,439 --> 01:03:00,206
        WE WILL                 
        GO TONIGHT,             

749
01:03:00,274 --> 01:03:07,164
BUT WE MUST BE ABLE             
TO GUARANTEE SECURITY.          

750
01:03:07,231 --> 01:03:08,131
WE STILL DON'T KNOW             

751
01:03:08,199 --> 01:03:09,966
WHAT THE HELL                   
WE'RE DEALING WITH.             

752
01:03:10,034 --> 01:03:16,973
         WHAT WOULD YOU         
     SUGGEST THAT WE DO?        

753
01:03:17,041 --> 01:03:19,142
I WANT TO PUT                   
A TEMP FREEZE                   
ON COUNTDOWN                    

754
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:20,844
UNTIL WE'RE                     
ALL CLEAR.                      

755
01:03:20,912 --> 01:03:24,514
THEN IT'S                       
YOUR SHOW.                      

756
01:03:24,582 --> 01:03:26,016
     YOU GOT YOURSELF           
                A DEAL.         

757
01:03:49,724 --> 01:03:51,257
NO, IT'S                        
A TEMP FREEZE.                  

758
01:03:51,325 --> 01:03:53,927
WELL, TELL MISSION CONTROL      
I'M AUTHORIZING IT.             

759
01:03:53,995 --> 01:03:55,862
I KNOW, I'LL BE                 
RIGHT DOWN.                     

760
01:03:55,930 --> 01:03:57,064
            GOOD, DOCTOR.       

761
01:03:57,131 --> 01:03:58,732
 GENERAL, WE'RE GOING           
    DOWN TO CONTROL.            

762
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,167
WE'LL BE BACK SOON.             

763
01:04:00,234 --> 01:04:01,267
             GENERAL, LISTEN!   

764
01:04:01,335 --> 01:04:02,936
             WE HAVE A BREAK    
             IN SECURITY, SIR!  

765
01:04:03,004 --> 01:04:05,939

01:04:49,467 --> 01:04:50,366
STEAL WHAT?

             DAD, LET ME SEE    
                     THE BACK   
                 OF YOUR NECK.  

1191
01:32:52,698 --> 01:32:54,165
IT MUST HAVE BEEN               
SOME DREAM.                     

1192
01:32:54,233 --> 01:32:56,101
             PLEASE, LET ME SEE.

01:32:56,168 --> 01:32:57,335
IS IT OKAY?                     

1194
01:32:57,403 --> 01:32:58,669
                     IT'S OKAY. 

1195
01:32:58,737 --> 01:33:00,305
             WHAT ABOUT ME?     

1196
01:33:00,373 --> 01:33:02,540
             YOU'RE FINE, MOM.  

1197
01:33:02,608 --> 01:33:03,358
                         WHEW.  

1198
01:33:03,425 --> 01:33:04,825
         OH, DARLING.           

1199
01:33:04,893 --> 01:33:06,827
                        YOU SEE,
            THE SPACESHIP LANDED

1200
01:33:06,895 --> 01:33:09,497
                 RIGHT IN BACK  
                 OF THE HILL.   

1201
01:33:09,565 --> 01:33:11,232
            WHAT DID?           

1202
01:33:11,450 --> 01:33:17,172
AND YOU STARTED                 
CHASING ME DOWN THE HILL.       

1203
01:33:17,239 --> 01:33:21,108
 THEN EVERYTHING EXPLODED       
 INTO A GREAT BIG WHITE LIGHT.  

1204
01:33:21,177 --> 01:33:22,877
THAT IS                         
REALLY WEIRD, DAVID.            

1205
01:33:22,944 --> 01:33:24,312
                     ACTUALLY,  
                I LIKE THE STUFF

     SO REAL.

         OF ALL SORTS OF THINGS 

1213
01:33:40,229 --> 01:33:42,530

1216
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:53,608
                 BUT I WAS      
                 SO SCARED.     

1217
01:33:53,676 --> 01:33:56,244
