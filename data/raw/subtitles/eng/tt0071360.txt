1
00:00:39,788 --> 00:00:41,498
# Won't you come home,
Bill Bailey? #

2
00:00:41,623 --> 00:00:42,832
# Won't you come home? #

3
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:46,670
# I moan the whole night long #

4
00:00:46,795 --> 00:00:49,672
# I'll do the cooking, honey,
I'll pay the rent #

5
00:00:49,798 --> 00:00:52,217
# I know I done him wrong #

6
00:00:52,301 --> 00:00:53,677
# Yes, you did #

7
00:00:53,802 --> 00:00:54,969
# Remember that rainy eve #

8
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:56,471
# She threw me out #

9
00:00:56,597 --> 00:00:59,474
# With nothing but
a fine-tooth comb #

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,393
# But I know she's to blame #

11
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:03,436
# Yeah, ain't it a shame #

12
00:01:30,506 --> 00:01:32,591
# Oh, Bill Bailey,
won't you please #

13
00:01:32,716 --> 00:01:34,759
# Bill Bailey,
won't you please come #

14
00:01:34,885 --> 00:01:38,305
# Bill Bailey,
won't you please come home? #

15
00:01:56,156 --> 00:01:57,574
# When the red, red robin #

16
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,077
# Comes bob,
bob, bobbin' along #

17
00:02:00,202 --> 00:02:01,453
# Along #

18
00:02:01,578 --> 00:02:02,954
# There'll be
no more sobbin' #

19
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,581
# When he starts throbbin' #

20
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:07,292
# His own sweet song #

21
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,293
# Wake up #

22
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,295
# Wake up, you sleepyhead #

23
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:11,296
# Get up #

24
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,923
# Get up, get out of bed #

25
00:02:13,048 --> 00:02:13,923
# Cheer up #

26
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:15,800
# Cheer up, the sun is red #

27
00:02:15,926 --> 00:02:16,801
# Live, love #

28
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:18,762
# Laugh and be happy #

29
00:02:18,887 --> 00:02:20,388
# What if I've been blue #

30
00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:24,267
# Now I'm walkin' through
fields of flowers #

31
00:02:24,393 --> 00:02:25,435
# Rain may glisten #

32
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:26,603
# But still I listen #

33
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,773
# For hours and hours #

34
00:02:29,898 --> 00:02:31,149
# I'm just a kid again #

35
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:32,776
# Doin' what I did again #

36
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:35,153
# Singin' my song #

37
00:02:35,237 --> 00:02:36,613
# When the red, red robin #

38
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:40,284
# Goes bob, bob, bobbin' along #

39
00:03:27,414 --> 00:03:28,748
# When the red, red robin #

40
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:31,167
# Goes bob, bob, bobbin' along #

41
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:32,669
# Along #

42
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,630
# There'll be no more sobbin' #

43
00:03:34,755 --> 00:03:36,047
# When he starts throbbin' #

44
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:39,009
# His own sweet song #

45
00:03:39,134 --> 00:03:40,009
# Wake up #

46
00:03:40,135 --> 00:03:41,970
# Wake up, you sleepyhead #

47
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:42,971
# Get up #

48
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,140
# Get up, get out of bed #

49
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:46,349
# Cheer up #

50
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:48,018
# Cheer up, the sun is red #

51
00:03:48,143 --> 00:03:51,229
# Live, love,
laugh, and be happy... #

52
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:59,946
I want to go over
to my place...

53
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:03,366
and start,
you know, getting it on...

54
00:04:03,492 --> 00:04:05,452
I was terrible.

55
00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:06,452
Yeah?

56
00:04:06,578 --> 00:04:08,621
Did you ever, uh...
take ballet?

57
00:04:08,747 --> 00:04:09,706
Be thankful.

58
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,626
Do you have a quarter for them?

59
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:14,335
Yes, I do.

60
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:21,551
# Bob, bob, bob, bob,
bobbin' along #

61
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:22,636
# Wake up #

62
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:24,888
# Wake up, you sleepyhead #

63
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,474
# Da da da da da da #

64
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,484
Well, what about me?

65
00:04:40,654 --> 00:04:42,656
You'll see.

66
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:45,074
A lot of fun you are.

67
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,951
You're supposed to tease me...

68
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:48,995
give me hints,
make me guess, you know.

69
00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:05,887
Oh, look. That's terrible.

70
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:08,598
He's not hurting anyone.

71
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:13,353
Neither are we.

72
00:05:14,438 --> 00:05:15,480
Oh, God.

73
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,942
Every time I see
one of those old guys...

74
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,653
I always think the same thing.

75
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,739
What do you think?

76
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:25,615
I always think...

77
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:28,785
that he was once
somebody's baby boy.

78
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,287
Really, I do.

79
00:05:30,412 --> 00:05:33,289
I think he was once
somebody's baby boy...

80
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:36,042
and he had a mother
and a father who loved him...

81
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:37,961
and now there he is...

82
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,671
half dead on a park bench...

83
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,299
and where are
his mother or his father...

84
00:05:42,424 --> 00:05:44,467
all his uncles now?

85
00:05:44,593 --> 00:05:47,721
Anyway, that's
what I always think.

86
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:50,223
How's he doing up there?

87
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,309
When they had
the newspaper strike...

88
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:54,769
We're gettin' better than 40%.

89
00:05:54,895 --> 00:05:57,063
How about second position?

90
00:06:01,443 --> 00:06:03,486
It's not so good.

91
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,215
Uh-oh. What have we here?

92
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,301
Come on, babies,
wet your lips there.

93
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,803
Give me some tongue.

94
00:06:27,928 --> 00:06:29,304
Just a little tongue.

95
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,597
Come on.

96
00:06:33,517 --> 00:06:36,520
How about a nice
wet French kiss now?

97
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:39,022
Come on. A nice wet one.

98
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,108
Pay attention
to your recordings.

99
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,904
She's coming in loud and clear.

100
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,407
Look, Mark. Do you see him?

101
00:06:48,532 --> 00:06:51,076
The man with the hearing aid
like Charles.

102
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:53,077
There with the shopping bag.

103
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:55,079
Well, that's it for Paul.

104
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:56,581
They spotted him.

105
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,208
Give me the phones.

106
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:01,587
He's been following us all around.

107
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,256
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

108
00:07:04,381 --> 00:07:07,133
We're spending too much time
together here.

109
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,135
No. Let's stay
just a little longer.

110
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:33,785
I got burned, Harry.

111
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,287
She looked at me.

112
00:07:35,412 --> 00:07:36,788
I know. We heard.

113
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,290
Oh, did we hear.

114
00:07:38,415 --> 00:07:40,667
What do you think?

115
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,087
I got some
good pieces, maybe 25%.

116
00:07:49,718 --> 00:07:51,469
Paul, I'll call you
in a couple days...

117
00:07:51,595 --> 00:07:52,929
if I need you.

118
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,932
Paul, you going
to the convention tomorrow?

119
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:56,933
You bet.

120
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,186
Hey, how about you, Harry?

121
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:00,311
Yeah. Maybe.

122
00:08:00,437 --> 00:08:03,273
Little party like we did
two years ago?

123
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,274
Huh?

124
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,609
Hey, Stan?

125
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:07,110
See you, Harry.

126
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,237
Okay.

127
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,237
Here.

128
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,955
He's a nice guy for a cop.

129
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,582
You go.

130
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,876
I'll stay here a while.

131
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,879
Who's interested
in these two anyway?

132
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,382
I don't know for sure.

133
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:29,883
The Justice Department?

134
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,635
No.

135
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,012
I figure it must be
the Infernal Revenue.

136
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:37,015
Their tapes always
put me to sleep.

137
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,977
Since when are you
here to be entertained?

138
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,813
Sometimes it's nice to know
what they're talking about.

139
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:45,815
I don't care what
they're talking about.

140
00:08:45,941 --> 00:08:49,235
All I want is
a nice, fat recording.

141
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:54,634
Hello, Mr Caul.

142
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,470
And happy birthday.

143
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,681
Happy birthday, Harry.

144
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,519
Happy birthday.

145
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,806
Hello.

146
00:11:22,931 --> 00:11:24,974
Hello, uh, Mrs Evangelista?

147
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,975
Uh, yes.

148
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:28,520
This is Harry Caul
from upstairs.

149
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:30,605
Uh, uh...

150
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:31,773
Yes.

151
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,191
Well...

152
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,901
Thank you very much.

153
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:35,902
Thank you.

154
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,654
Uh-huh.

155
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,199
Yes, well,
you're really very nice.

156
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,200
Yes.

157
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,493
Uh, but...

158
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,245
I know, uh...

159
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,123
Yes, I found it. Yes.

160
00:11:48,248 --> 00:11:51,668
But what I wanted to talk
to you about was, uh...

161
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,797
How did you put it
in the apartment?

162
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,341
Uh-huh.

163
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,217
Right.

164
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:02,512
Well, what about the alarm?

165
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,307
Oh, you did?

166
00:12:09,144 --> 00:12:10,019
Well...

167
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:11,020
uh...

168
00:12:11,146 --> 00:12:14,023
I thought I had the only key.

169
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:15,108
Uh-huh.

170
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:20,655
Well, what emergency
could possibly...

171
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,157
All right.

172
00:12:22,282 --> 00:12:23,157
Yes.

173
00:12:23,283 --> 00:12:26,160
Well, see, I would
be perfectly happy...

174
00:12:26,286 --> 00:12:28,663
to have all
my personal things...

175
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,665
burned up in a fire...

176
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,168
because I don't
have anything personal.

177
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:34,669
Nothing of value.

178
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,671
Nothing personal
except my keys...

179
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:40,008
which I would like
to have the only copy of...

180
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,176
Mrs Evangelista.

181
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:44,846
Mrs Evangelista...

182
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,849
how'd you know
it was my birthday?

183
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,352
Nah. I don't remember
telling you.

184
00:12:50,477 --> 00:12:54,689
Would you like to take
a guess how old I am?

185
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,692
44. Well,
that's a very good guess.

186
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,194
Mrs Evangelista...

187
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:04,449
as of today, my mail
will go to a post office box...

188
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,452
with a combination on it
and no keys.

189
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,537
Goodbye.

190
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,368
Morning, Harry.

191
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,368
Morning.

192
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,162
There's an article in here...

193
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:33,371
about the convention.

194
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,873
It mentions your name.

195
00:14:34,998 --> 00:14:36,874
You're one of the notables...

196
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,377
who's going tomorrow night.

197
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,879
I told them I'd be there.

198
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,423
Listen to this here.

199
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,091
Listen.

200
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,594
"Among those
pre-eminent in the field...

201
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,096
expected to attend...

202
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,598
are Hal Lipset and Harry Caul...

203
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,100
from San Francisco.

204
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,601
Kenneth Sperry will speak...

205
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,603
on Surveillance and The Law.

206
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,646
Wait a minute.

207
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:01,357
Listen to this.
Where the hell is it?

208
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,110
"Also attending
will be William P. Moran...

209
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,111
of Detroit, Michigan."

210
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,448
Since when did William P. Moran
of Detroit, Michigan...

211
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,409
become pre-eminent in the field?

212
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,410
Oh, he's very big there.

213
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,287
You want some coffee?

214
00:15:16,623 --> 00:15:19,000
He's the guy
that told Chrysler...

215
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:22,212
that Cadillac was
getting rid of its fins.

216
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,630
It was a while ago...

217
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,759
but it was a big thing
at the time.

218
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,479
December 2nd, 1 p.m.

219
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,897
Shopping bag...

220
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:41,982
unit "A".

221
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,158
December 2nd, 1 p.m.

222
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,286
Parabolic, unit "B".

223
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,962
December 2nd, 1 p.m.

224
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,006
City of Paris, unit "C".

225
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,074
# Wake up #

226
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,366
# Wake up, you sleepyhead #

227
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,869
# Da da da da da da #

228
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:37,453
What do you think?

229
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:41,165
I don't know what I'm going
to get him for Christmas yet.

230
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,501
He's already got everything.

231
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:45,003
He doesn't need
anything any more.

232
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,046
Well...

233
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,506
I haven't decided
what I'm going...

234
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,008
to get you yet.

235
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,976
...get him for Christmas yet.

236
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,436
He's already got everything.

237
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,939
He doesn't need
anything any more.

238
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:08,610
Well, I haven't decided
what I'm going to get you yet.

239
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,946
Well, you better start looking.

240
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,614
Well, what about me?

241
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,742
You'll see.

242
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,745
Whoo! A lot of fun you are.

243
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,747
You're supposed to tease me...

244
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,249
give me hints...

245
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,250
make me guess, you know.

246
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,752
Does it bother you?

247
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,753
What?

248
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,797
Walking around
in circles.

249
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,470
Oh, look. That's terrible.

250
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,471
He's not hurting anyone.

251
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,056
Neither are we.

252
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,228
Oh, God.

253
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:48,359
Every time I see one
of those old guys, I...

254
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,244
Every time I see one
of those old guys...

255
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,872
I always think
the same thing.

256
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,373
What do you think?

257
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:07,669
I always think he was once
somebody's baby boy.

258
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,421
No, really, I do.

259
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:12,423
I think he was once
somebody's baby boy...

260
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,218
and he had
a mother and a father...

261
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,720
who loved him...

262
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:17,720
and now there he is...

263
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,472
half dead on a park bench...

264
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,975
and where are his
mother or his father...

265
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,477
all his uncles now?

266
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:27,147
Anyway, that's what
I always think.

267
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:31,150
I always think how, when
they had the newspaper strike...

268
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,569
more of those old guys died.

269
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:37,324
50 of them froze
to death in one night.

270
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,446
Good afternoon.

271
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,948
May I help you?

272
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,992
Yes. Extension 746, please.

273
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,536
One moment, please.

274
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,121
Director's office.

275
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,582
Uh, yes, this is Mr Caul.

276
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,128
I have the material.

277
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,129
I'm calling
for an appointment.

278
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,297
I'm sorry.

279
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,300
The director has already
left for the day.

280
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,136
We'll call you back
tomorrow morning.

281
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,638
May I have
your telephone number, please?

282
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,140
I'm at a payphone...

283
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,642
and I don't have
a home telephone.

284
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,519
Hold on one moment, please.

285
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:54,651
Mr Caul?

286
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:55,652
Yes?

287
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,154
2:30 tomorrow afternoon.

288
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,655
2:30 in the afternoon?

289
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,658
Is that payment in full?

290
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,202
Whatever was arranged.

291
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,163
Thank you very much.

292
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,622
I'll be there.

293
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,035
Harry?

294
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,036
Hello, Amy.

295
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:31,415
I didn't think you were coming.

296
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:38,881
I brought some wine, um...

297
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,883
someone gave me
as a birthday present.

298
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:46,597
I didn't know
it was your birthday.

299
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,098
You want some?

300
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,265
Yeah.

301
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,683
I do.

302
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,488
How old are you, Harry?

303
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,741
42.

304
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:12,247
Sweet.

305
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,920
Does something special
happen between us...

306
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,422
on your birthday?

307
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,048
Like what?

308
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,884
Something personal.

309
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:28,388
What?

310
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,601
Like, uh, telling me
about yourself...

311
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,894
your secrets.

312
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,705
I don't have any secrets.

313
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:59,169
I'm your secret.

314
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,170
You do have secrets, Harry.

315
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,588
I know you do.

316
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:03,674
No.

317
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,675
Sometimes you come over here...

318
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,677
and you don't tell me.

319
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,680
Once I saw you
up by the staircase...

320
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:11,681
hiding...

321
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,433
watching...

322
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,519
for a whole hour.

323
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,777
You think you're going
to catch me at something.

324
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,445
You know?

325
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:28,782
I know. A woman can always tell.

326
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:34,037
You have a certain way
of opening the door.

327
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,875
First the key
goes in real quiet...

328
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,878
and then the door
comes open real fast...

329
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:45,007
like you think you'll
catch me at something.

330
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,647
Sometimes I even think
you're listening to me...

331
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:03,567
when I'm talking
on the telephone.

332
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,945
What are you talking about?

333
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,447
I don't know.

334
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,948
I just feel it.

335
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:11,658
Really, I do.

336
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,418
# Wake up #

337
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:25,255
# Wake up, you sleepyhead #

338
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,507
# Get up #

339
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,800
# Get up, get out... #

340
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,844
Why are you singing that?

341
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,680
It's pretty.

342
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:43,565
What's the matter?

343
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:45,192
Nothing.

344
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,694
It's just that, uh...

345
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,781
somebody else
was singing that today.

346
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,490
A girl?

347
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,783
Yes.

348
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,076
Who is she?

349
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,578
No. No. If isn't...

350
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:57,579
I'm jealous.

351
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:58,580
No.

352
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:00,082
Just somebody at work...

353
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,666
and she, uh...

354
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,461
She reminded me of you.

355
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,636
Where do you work, Harry?

356
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,140
Oh, different places,
different...

357
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,892
jobs, you know?

358
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,480
I'm kind of, uh,
a musician, you see.

359
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:24,772
Oh.

360
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,153
Freelance musician and, uh...

361
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,738
Uh-huh.

362
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:36,827
Where do you live?

363
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,829
Why can't I call you
over there?

364
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,582
'Cause I don't have a telephone.

365
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:46,795
Do you live alone?

366
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,928
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

367
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,764
'Cause it's your birthday.

368
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:05,104
I don't want people asking me
a lot of questions.

369
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,107
I want to know you.

370
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,447
Yes, I live alone.

371
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:15,782
Oh.

372
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:20,620
I don't feel like
answering any more questions.

373
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,004
Your rent is due.

374
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,174
Here's the money for it.

375
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,916
You never used to ask
a lot of questions.

376
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,919
Harry, I was so happy
when you came over tonight.

377
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,589
When I heard you open the door...

378
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:15,134
my toes were dancing
under the covers.

379
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:20,138
But I don't think I'm going
to wait for you any more.

380
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,881
I have a package
for the director.

381
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,883
All right. I'll take it.

382
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,636
No. I'm supposed to
hand it to him personally.

383
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,138
I have an appointment.

384
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,639
Are you Mr Caul?

385
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:46,141
Yes, I am.

386
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,643
A Mr Caul is here. All right.

387
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:50,145
Make yourself comfortable.

388
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,647
The director's assistant
will be right down.

389
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:34,606
There are some nice
Christmas cookies I made. Want one?

390
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:35,774
They're good.

391
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,317
No, thanks. I...

392
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:07,389
What do you see?

393
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,890
Oh, not much.

394
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:11,893
Here's your money..
$ 15.000 cash, as you asked.

395
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:13,395
These are our tapes?

396
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,064
I had an arrangement
with the director.

397
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,567
I was to give those
to him personally.

398
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,069
I understand.
He's not here this afternoon.

399
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:23,071
He's out of the country.

400
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:26,867
He asked me to get the tapes
and give you the money.

401
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:51,725
I guess I can just wait on this.

402
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,734
Now, look, don't get involved
in this, Mr Caul.

403
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,779
These tapes are dangerous.

404
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:07,782
You heard them.
You know what I mean.

405
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:09,659
Someone may get hurt.

406
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:21,838
Mr Caul, be careful.

407
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:18,872
Well, what about me?

408
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,373
You'll see.

409
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,376
Whoo! A lot of fun you are.

410
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:29,174
# When the red, red robin #

411
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:32,552
# Goes bob, bob, bobbin' along #

412
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:34,179
# Along #

413
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:40,060
Who started
this conversation anyhow?

414
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:42,645
You did.

415
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,564
I did not.

416
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,567
Yes, you did.
You just don't remember it.

417
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:56,201
Pretend like
I just told you a joke.

418
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:58,537
Ha ha ha ha.

419
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,124
Does it bother you?

420
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,125
What?

421
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:06,253
Walking around in circles.

422
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:09,589
Oh, look. That's terrible.

423
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:12,634
He's not hurting anyone.

424
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,219
Neither are we.

425
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:18,181
Oh, God.

426
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:21,685
Every time I see
one of those old guys...

427
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,187
I always think the same thing.

428
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:25,689
What do you think?

429
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,690
Yeah, what do you think?

430
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:30,985
I always think
that he was once some--

431
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:37,075
Hey, Harry, what do you say
we take a break?

432
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:40,787
We'll go to AI's Transbay.
I'll buy you a beer.

433
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:42,664
No. I want to finish this.

434
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:45,167
I thought you turned
those tapes in.

435
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,294
Stan, be quiet, will you?

436
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,757
Do you think we can do this?

437
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:54,759
I'm tired of drinking anyhow.

438
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:56,761
What a stupid conversation.

439
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:59,264
Stan, please.
I'm trying to work.

440
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,225
I'm tired of mostly everything.

441
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,726
Tired of me?

442
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:05,812
Tired of you... but not today.

443
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:10,316
What the hell they talking about,
for Christ's sakes?

444
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,319
Stanley, please,
I'm trying to get this done.

445
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,321
All right. Don't get excited.

446
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:18,158
Well, I'm getting fed up.

447
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:19,409
About what?

448
00:35:19,535 --> 00:35:22,287
About your asking me questions
all day long.

449
00:35:23,414 --> 00:35:24,748
Jesus.

450
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,958
Don't say that.

451
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:28,627
Well, for Christ's sakes!

452
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,628
Stan, don't say that
again, please.

453
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,630
Don't use that word in vain.

454
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,174
It bothers me.

455
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:37,177
What's the matter, Harry?

456
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,556
Your work's getting sloppy.

457
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:48,563
Later in the week,
Sunday maybe.

458
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:50,941
Sunday definitely.

459
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:54,820
We'd have a much better track...

460
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:57,280
if you'd paid more attention
to the recording...

461
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:59,783
and less to what
they were talking about.

462
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:03,119
Why do questions about
what's going on bother you?

463
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:06,122
I can't explain
the personal problems of my clients.

464
00:36:11,712 --> 00:36:13,255
Jack Tar Hotel.

465
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:16,466
3:00.

466
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:19,261
Room 773.

467
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:21,638
If you filled me in
once in a while...

468
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:22,681
Ever think of that?

469
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:25,141
It has nothing to do
with either of us.

470
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:27,310
It's curiosity,
goddam human nature.

471
00:36:30,481 --> 00:36:32,858
Listen, if there's
one sure-fire rule...

472
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:34,859
I've learned
in this business is...

473
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:37,862
I don't know anything about
human nature or curiosity.

474
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:40,865
That's not part of what I do.

475
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:43,660
This is my business,
and when I'm...

476
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,503
I'll see you later.

477
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:13,106
I think he's been
recording my telephone.

478
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:20,697
I love you.

479
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:23,700
We're spending too much time
together here.

480
00:37:23,826 --> 00:37:26,620
No. Let's stay
just a little longer.

481
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:44,471
I think he's been
recording my telephone.

482
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:07,053
He'd kill us
if he got the chance.

483
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:31,619
He'd kill us
if he got the chance.

484
00:40:19,293 --> 00:40:22,170
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

485
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:28,593
It's been three months
since my last confession.

486
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:31,513
I...

487
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,061
These are my sins.

488
00:40:41,315 --> 00:40:44,192
I've taken
the Lord's name in vain...

489
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:46,028
on several occasions.

490
00:40:49,198 --> 00:40:50,115
I...

491
00:40:54,328 --> 00:40:57,706
On a number of occasions, I've
taken newspapers from the racks...

492
00:40:57,831 --> 00:41:00,208
without paying for them.

493
00:41:00,334 --> 00:41:01,209
I...

494
00:41:06,507 --> 00:41:10,177
have deliberately taken pleasure
in impure thoughts...

495
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,511
and...

496
00:41:12,805 --> 00:41:15,432
I've been involved
in some work...

497
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:17,934
that I think will be used...

498
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,437
to hurt these two young people.

499
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:22,647
It's happened to me before.

500
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:25,650
People were hurt
because of my... my work.

501
00:41:25,776 --> 00:41:28,653
I'm... I'm afraid
it could happen again...

502
00:41:28,779 --> 00:41:31,656
and I... I was in no way
responsible.

503
00:41:31,782 --> 00:41:33,200
I'm not responsible.

504
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:37,203
For these and all the sins
of my past life...

505
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:38,705
I am heartily sorry.

506
00:41:50,426 --> 00:41:52,219
Hi. Can I help you?

507
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:54,679
You could explain
your system to me.

508
00:41:54,805 --> 00:41:56,681
Mr Caul,
I'm Jim Storey.

509
00:41:56,807 --> 00:41:58,225
How do you do?

510
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:01,144
Come in and take a look
at the system.

511
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,146
This is for
the surveillance...

512
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:05,148
of telephone
communication systems.

513
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:06,316
I see.

514
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:07,317
Now available.

515
00:42:07,443 --> 00:42:09,319
Here's the new LT 500.

516
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:13,991
If you're in surveillance,
you belong into the LT 500.

517
00:42:14,116 --> 00:42:15,826
You can hear...

518
00:42:17,161 --> 00:42:19,538
and know exactly which door
has been violated.

519
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:22,540
And you got your local alarms
on the doors...

520
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:24,542
which I'm sure you've heard.

521
00:42:24,668 --> 00:42:25,919
It's quite noisy.

522
00:42:26,045 --> 00:42:28,422
It has a Super 8mm
camera in here...

523
00:42:28,547 --> 00:42:30,423
and the dot, the 10:00 dot...

524
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:33,426
will show exactly what
the camera sees on the back.

525
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:35,428
It's a magazine-loaded camera.

526
00:42:35,554 --> 00:42:36,680
Super 8mm...

527
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:38,181
William P. Moran.

528
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:41,268
William P. Moran
of Detroit, Michigan.

529
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:43,853
House courtesy telephone,
please.

530
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:50,193
That's your automatic
recorder actuator.

531
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,446
It undetectably
starts the recorder...

532
00:42:52,571 --> 00:42:54,531
when the phone is lifted...

533
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:58,534
and shuts it off
when the receiver is put back.

534
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,535
What?

535
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:01,871
It's real nice, you know.

536
00:43:01,997 --> 00:43:04,124
It's not your old-fashioned
voice actuator...

537
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,125
you know,
always starting the recorder...

538
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:07,627
when nobody was talking...

539
00:43:07,753 --> 00:43:09,713
or shutting it off
in the middle...

540
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:11,214
of an important conversation.

541
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,133
Is it like the Moran actuator?

542
00:43:13,217 --> 00:43:16,136
The Moran E-27 is a copy.

543
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,972
I won't let him even
smell my equipment any more.

544
00:43:19,098 --> 00:43:20,474
You in surveillance?

545
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:21,474
Yeah.

546
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,476
Law enforcement
or private operator?

547
00:43:23,602 --> 00:43:24,519
Private.

548
00:43:24,645 --> 00:43:28,023
You mind if I take
your name and address...

549
00:43:28,148 --> 00:43:29,524
for our mailing list?

550
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,234
Harry Cau... Harry Caul?

551
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,736
I didn't recognize you.

552
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:35,738
Say, I wonder,
would you take a Model 510-A?

553
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:38,157
Free of charge. Just to test it.

554
00:43:38,283 --> 00:43:40,159
You know, say, in return for...

555
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:43,663
that we could print
in our flier that you use it.

556
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:46,166
I build all my own equipment.
Thank you.

557
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:49,669
Maybe we could take a picture
of you by our booth.

558
00:43:49,795 --> 00:43:52,088
It would be a great honour
for Spectre.

559
00:44:37,301 --> 00:44:39,177
This is not helping crime.

560
00:44:39,303 --> 00:44:40,721
It's helping justice...

561
00:44:56,278 --> 00:44:59,197
That may be affixed to
the subject's automobile--

562
00:44:59,281 --> 00:45:00,365
Slide.

563
00:45:00,491 --> 00:45:03,327
and will transmit
a pulsating tone signal--

564
00:45:03,452 --> 00:45:04,327
Slide.

565
00:45:04,453 --> 00:45:05,829
which is highly detectable.

566
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:07,705
Harry, good to see you.

567
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:09,123
Beautiful suit.

568
00:45:09,249 --> 00:45:10,625
You like it? It's French.

569
00:45:10,751 --> 00:45:12,002
Oh.

570
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:15,004
Let's go get a drink and talk.

571
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:18,007
Requiring no knowledge
or skill in electronics.

572
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:20,093
Come on. It's a bore.

573
00:45:22,763 --> 00:45:25,640
The TA-30 may be
installed and concealed...

574
00:45:25,766 --> 00:45:29,227
under the dash
in a matter of seconds.

575
00:45:29,353 --> 00:45:33,231
Hey, come on. There's somebody
I want you to meet...

576
00:45:33,357 --> 00:45:34,733
a competitor of yours.

577
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:36,234
Hey, Bernie, old buddy.

578
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,736
Yeah, Paulie, what's up?

579
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:40,154
This is Harry Caul.
William P. Moran.

580
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,656
Harry Caul, my pleasure.

581
00:45:41,782 --> 00:45:43,158
My friends call me Bernie.

582
00:45:43,283 --> 00:45:45,285
I heard a lot about you.

583
00:45:45,411 --> 00:45:47,162
Bernie just moved in
from Detroit.

584
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:49,664
He's the fella
that let Chrysler know...

585
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,666
Cadillac was
discontinuing its fins.

586
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:53,043
I heard.

587
00:45:53,168 --> 00:45:55,545
You're a tough man
to get ahold of.

588
00:45:55,671 --> 00:45:59,049
I've been wanting
to talk to you for a long time.

589
00:45:59,174 --> 00:46:01,092
Take five. We'll get a drink.

590
00:46:01,218 --> 00:46:03,303
Maybe in a couple minutes.

591
00:46:03,429 --> 00:46:06,223
Honey, sweetheart,
show time, all right?

592
00:46:06,348 --> 00:46:10,143
I'd appreciate if you stuck around
for the demonstration.

593
00:46:10,227 --> 00:46:12,771
Um, ladies and gentlemen.

594
00:46:12,896 --> 00:46:14,606
Ladies and gentlemen.

595
00:46:14,732 --> 00:46:17,276
Ladies and gentlemen,
what we have here...

596
00:46:17,401 --> 00:46:20,278
is the Moran S-15
harmonica tap.

597
00:46:20,404 --> 00:46:22,781
This electronic marvel
can be installed...

598
00:46:22,906 --> 00:46:25,283
in a matter of two minutes.

599
00:46:25,409 --> 00:46:29,287
Notice here it has its own
nickel cadmium power source...

600
00:46:29,413 --> 00:46:32,290
so it cannot be detected
on the line.

601
00:46:32,416 --> 00:46:34,626
Once installed,
it can be phoned...

602
00:46:34,752 --> 00:46:37,171
from any telephone
in the world...

603
00:46:37,254 --> 00:46:38,630
Singapore, Karachi, even Moscow.

604
00:46:38,756 --> 00:46:41,800
I say Moscow 'cause
you look Russian, sir...

605
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:43,301
with the beard.

606
00:46:43,427 --> 00:46:45,303
Just dial the target's
phone number...

607
00:46:45,429 --> 00:46:47,305
pause before the last digit...

608
00:46:47,431 --> 00:46:49,808
blow the harmonica tone
into the phone...

609
00:46:49,933 --> 00:46:51,309
press the last digit.

610
00:46:51,435 --> 00:46:54,813
The phone will not ring
in the target's house.

611
00:46:54,938 --> 00:46:56,314
Instead, the receiver...

612
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,317
will be turned into
an actual room microphone...

613
00:46:59,443 --> 00:47:01,778
thus enabling surveillance
to take place.

614
00:47:01,904 --> 00:47:04,781
And now, by way of
an actual demonstration...

615
00:47:04,907 --> 00:47:09,286
we've installed one of these units
in my very own home.

616
00:47:09,411 --> 00:47:11,788
I will now dial that number.

617
00:47:11,914 --> 00:47:12,789
Thank you.

618
00:47:17,753 --> 00:47:20,505
I pause before the last digit.

619
00:47:22,383 --> 00:47:23,300
Harmonica.

620
00:47:27,596 --> 00:47:29,848
I dial the last digit.

621
00:47:33,102 --> 00:47:35,979
You will note the phone
does not ring.

622
00:47:36,105 --> 00:47:38,482
Can we get away?

623
00:47:38,607 --> 00:47:40,984
I don't know. Maybe I can.

624
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:42,694
Where's your husband?

625
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:44,905
He's out at a convention.

626
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:48,157
When will he be back?

627
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:49,659
Not until late.

628
00:47:49,785 --> 00:47:52,162
April Fool.
Just a little joke, folks.

629
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:54,163
That shows you
the possibilities...

630
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:56,165
Larry Peterson Burns.
Telephone call.

631
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:58,668
Thank you. The demonstration
is concluded.

632
00:47:58,794 --> 00:48:02,088
I'd like you to take some
literature on your way.

633
00:48:02,172 --> 00:48:04,966
What did you think of that?
You like it?

634
00:48:05,092 --> 00:48:06,468
That's a good item.

635
00:48:06,593 --> 00:48:08,595
Good for
the catalogue suckers, huh?

636
00:48:08,721 --> 00:48:11,098
Here you go, Harry.
Have a free pen.

637
00:48:11,223 --> 00:48:12,098
You, too, Paulie.

638
00:48:12,224 --> 00:48:13,892
I'd rather have a free drink.

639
00:48:14,018 --> 00:48:15,602
Hey, me, too.

640
00:48:15,728 --> 00:48:17,604
Stanley, do me a favour, huh?

641
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:19,606
Mind the booth, all right?

642
00:48:19,732 --> 00:48:21,608
That's what I pay you for.

643
00:48:21,734 --> 00:48:24,903
Just a couple of minutes
to get a drink.

644
00:48:25,029 --> 00:48:26,488
Hi, Harry.

645
00:48:26,613 --> 00:48:28,364
Hi, Stan.

646
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:29,365
That's right.

647
00:48:29,491 --> 00:48:32,076
You two used to
work together, huh?

648
00:48:34,663 --> 00:48:38,124
That son of a bitch
stole my latest idea.

649
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:40,627
A lot of nice ladies
are here tonight.

650
00:48:40,753 --> 00:48:42,546
Forget it.
She's a part-time nun.

651
00:48:42,671 --> 00:48:44,547
Hey, Harry, where you going?

652
00:48:44,673 --> 00:48:46,132
Go on without me.

653
00:48:46,258 --> 00:48:48,134
I'm going to talk to Stan.

654
00:48:48,218 --> 00:48:50,637
We'll meet you at
the chrome-dome exhibit.

655
00:48:50,763 --> 00:48:52,055
Don't be long, Harry.

656
00:49:02,691 --> 00:49:05,944
Since when are you
working for Moran, Stanley?

657
00:49:09,198 --> 00:49:10,741
Since yesterday.

658
00:49:10,866 --> 00:49:12,117
Mm-hmm.

659
00:49:12,201 --> 00:49:13,577
Listen, that wasn't serious.

660
00:49:13,702 --> 00:49:16,121
That was just
a stupid argument.

661
00:49:16,205 --> 00:49:17,581
That wasn't it, Harry.

662
00:49:17,706 --> 00:49:19,582
It's just time I moved up.

663
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:24,419
I don't want you
telling him about my things.

664
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:25,963
It's not ethical.

665
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:29,425
There's not much you
ever let me in on.

666
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,969
Okay. I'll show you
some of the stuff.

667
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:33,971
You won't show me anything.

668
00:49:34,055 --> 00:49:35,431
You'll keep it to yourself.

669
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:37,266
You know damn well you will.

670
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,810
No, really, Stan, wait a while.

671
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:41,812
Will you think about it?

672
00:49:41,938 --> 00:49:46,025
Don't do this to me now.

673
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:50,445
Some guy's following me.

674
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:52,447
Who?

675
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:53,991
I don't know.

676
00:49:54,075 --> 00:49:57,119
It has something to do
with the assignment last week.

677
00:49:57,245 --> 00:50:01,624
I don't know what it's about,
but I don't like it.

678
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:04,918
Okay, all right.

679
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:07,588
Thanks, Stan.

680
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:13,510
This is junk.

681
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:39,703
You have reached
a disconnected number.

682
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:42,915
Will you please make sure you...

683
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:52,049
Information.

684
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:55,052
Number for
Amy Fredericks, please.

685
00:50:55,136 --> 00:50:56,512
It's a new listing.

686
00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:58,555
One moment, please.

687
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:06,980
Sir, I see no listing
for Amy Fredericks.

688
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:08,649
Thank you.

689
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:34,508
What are you doing here?

690
00:51:34,634 --> 00:51:37,511
Take it easy.
I'm just a messenger.

691
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:39,513
I brought you a drink.

692
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:41,515
Why are you following me?

693
00:51:41,641 --> 00:51:44,018
I'm not following you.
I'm looking for you.

694
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:45,602
There's a big difference.

695
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:48,105
How'd you know I was here?

696
00:51:48,231 --> 00:51:50,316
It's a convention
of wiretappers...

697
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:53,277
Oh, excuse me... surveillance
and security technicians.

698
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:54,778
It was a snap.

699
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:57,990
I'm not giving those tapes
to anybody but the director.

700
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,242
I know what you told me.

701
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:02,036
All right, what's the message?

702
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:05,289
We want you to deliver
the tapes on Sunday, 1:00.

703
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:06,790
The director will be there.

704
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:09,501
He'll accept the tapes
from you, in person.

705
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:12,004
You tell him
I'll think about it.

706
00:52:28,104 --> 00:52:29,021
Hey, Paulie!

707
00:52:29,105 --> 00:52:31,482
Come on!
Come on, let's go!

708
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:34,484
Lurleen and Millard,
get in the back there.

709
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:36,028
Stanley, get in front!

710
00:52:36,112 --> 00:52:39,031
I'm trying to dress up
the boss, okay?

711
00:52:39,115 --> 00:52:40,491
Take one out here.

712
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:43,201
Bernie, it's a
come-as-you-are party.

713
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:46,788
Wait a minute!
All the girls up front!

714
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:49,041
I think you take a right...

715
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:50,459
then a left...

716
00:52:50,585 --> 00:52:53,296
Sons of bitches!
Those smart asses!

717
00:52:53,421 --> 00:52:56,048
Who the hell they think
they're tangling with?

718
00:52:56,132 --> 00:52:58,175
Easy, we're going
to have a party.

719
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:03,805
Millard, make them stop.

720
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:04,973
Relax, honey.

721
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:07,476
Paul's the best tail man
in the country.

722
00:53:07,602 --> 00:53:09,478
Meredith, do you hear that?

723
00:53:09,604 --> 00:53:10,521
Ha ha.

724
00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:15,484
Make-4, 111.

725
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:16,986
I'm driving east on Lombard.

726
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:21,156
I'd like a rolling 10-28 on...

727
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:24,493
California 5-6-0...

728
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:26,912
Boy Adam Lincoln.

729
00:53:27,038 --> 00:53:29,373
What are you calling
for a 10-28 for?

730
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:31,166
Thanks.

731
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:38,507
Hey, Willie Sanchez...
33654 14th Street...

732
00:53:38,633 --> 00:53:40,009
162 pounds...

733
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:42,719
5' 10 1/2" shit head!

734
00:53:54,649 --> 00:53:58,361
Want me to pick
that lock for you, Harry?

735
00:53:58,486 --> 00:54:00,362
Hey, this'll be the bar.

736
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:01,864
It's freezing in here.

737
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:03,323
Oh, boy, Harry.

738
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:04,324
Okay.

739
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:07,327
All right, the bar is now open.

740
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:08,328
Stanley.

741
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:09,329
Yes, sir.

742
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:11,331
How about a little music?

743
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:13,834
The man wants a little music.

744
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,462
Harry, you got a nice shop here.

745
00:54:32,103 --> 00:54:35,481
I was rereading Dear Abby
the other night.

746
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:38,984
There was a letter from a fella
called "Lonely and Anonymous."

747
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,986
I think it was Harry.

748
00:54:41,112 --> 00:54:43,155
Hey!

749
00:54:44,532 --> 00:54:45,449
Ahh.

750
00:54:45,575 --> 00:54:47,410
Where's the club soda?

751
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,622
Let me tell you
something about Harry Caul.

752
00:54:51,747 --> 00:54:52,998
There you go.

753
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:55,209
I know you heard this
a thousand times...

754
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:57,127
but let me say it again.

755
00:54:57,253 --> 00:54:58,629
Here's to Harry...

756
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:00,130
the best, bar none.

757
00:55:00,256 --> 00:55:01,632
I'll drink to that.

758
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:03,008
Best what?

759
00:55:03,092 --> 00:55:05,969
The best bugger
on the West Coast.

760
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:08,972
Who's the best bugger
on the East Coast?

761
00:55:09,098 --> 00:55:09,973
Me.

762
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:11,975
I'll drink to that, too.

763
00:55:12,101 --> 00:55:13,268
I'll bet you will.

764
00:55:13,394 --> 00:55:15,062
I'll bet you will.

765
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:22,361
It's funny we never bumped
into each other in New York.

766
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:23,862
Why is that funny?

767
00:55:23,988 --> 00:55:26,448
We're in the same
business, same city.

768
00:55:26,574 --> 00:55:28,993
I figure we'd bump
into each other.

769
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:31,453
I didn't know
you came from New York.

770
00:55:31,579 --> 00:55:34,456
Are you kidding?
Harry's famous in New York.

771
00:55:34,582 --> 00:55:37,626
You know the only one
I couldn't figure out?

772
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:41,630
The welfare fund back in '68.

773
00:55:41,756 --> 00:55:43,632
How'd you know about that?

774
00:55:43,758 --> 00:55:45,634
Everybody in the biz knew.

775
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,137
Nobody knows how you did it.

776
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:49,471
Hmm?

777
00:55:49,597 --> 00:55:52,016
How'd you do it, Harry?

778
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:53,016
Harry.

779
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,017
Hmm?

780
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:55,477
10 cents a dance.

781
00:55:55,603 --> 00:55:56,478
Come on.

782
00:55:56,604 --> 00:55:57,521
Ooh.

783
00:56:03,069 --> 00:56:04,236
You all right?

784
00:56:04,362 --> 00:56:05,738
You hurt yourself?

785
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:07,656
No. Don't worry about my head.

786
00:56:07,782 --> 00:56:09,658
It happens all the time.

787
00:56:09,784 --> 00:56:12,161
When I was a little baby...

788
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:15,664
I loved to love to bang my head
up against the wall.

789
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:19,168
Sometimes I still feel
like doing it. It's comforting.

790
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:21,169
I tapped my first telephone...

791
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:23,672
when I was 12 years old...

792
00:56:23,798 --> 00:56:24,965
12 years old.

793
00:56:25,091 --> 00:56:28,469
It was a hallway payphone
where I lived.

794
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:31,471
For six months,
they didn't know who it was.

795
00:56:31,597 --> 00:56:34,474
My father, he was proud as hell.

796
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,976
He was beaming.

797
00:56:36,102 --> 00:56:37,103
Yeah, boy.

798
00:56:37,228 --> 00:56:39,939
"That Bernie's got a real brain,"
he said.

799
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:42,900
From then on,
it's been all uphill, Harry.

800
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:46,987
I got contacts you
wouldn't believe.

801
00:56:47,113 --> 00:56:49,448
Here. Well, bring them over.

802
00:56:52,952 --> 00:56:54,328
Take a cab over.

803
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:57,330
Nothing's sacred
with you, is it, Harry?

804
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:59,332
Sure. The more, the merrier.

805
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:02,502
We'll be here all night.

806
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:04,421
Oh! You son of a..

807
00:57:04,547 --> 00:57:07,424
Ha ha ha ha!

808
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:08,968
What's the matter, Harry?

809
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:10,969
Can't you take a vacation?

810
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:13,972
When are you getting
a new scrambler, Harry?

811
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:16,767
This went out
with the Trojan War.

812
00:57:16,893 --> 00:57:19,979
Come on.
I want to hear all about you.

813
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:21,980
Really obsolete, you know that?

814
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:24,441
Harry got himself a girlfriend.

815
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:26,402
Watch out, Harry.

816
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,945
Where are you from?

817
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:30,405
New York.

818
00:57:30,531 --> 00:57:33,408
I used to live in New York.

819
00:57:33,534 --> 00:57:35,953
First I worked
as a receptionist...

820
00:57:36,037 --> 00:57:38,956
and then I got
promoted to secretary.

821
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,959
And then I was promoted
to gal Friday...

822
00:57:42,043 --> 00:57:44,420
and special assistant
to the boss...

823
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:46,463
and then I married him.

824
00:58:04,857 --> 00:58:07,150
Do you live far from here?

825
00:58:13,366 --> 00:58:15,743
Harry?

826
00:58:15,868 --> 00:58:18,745
Are you still married?

827
00:58:18,871 --> 00:58:20,747
Oh, I don't know.

828
00:58:20,873 --> 00:58:22,249
Probably.

829
00:58:24,377 --> 00:58:26,253
I guess maybe I am.

830
00:58:26,379 --> 00:58:28,672
Last time I heard...

831
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:31,675
Well, he was trying to
scrape up enough money...

832
00:58:31,801 --> 00:58:33,677
to buy another hardware store.

833
00:58:33,803 --> 00:58:35,054
Yeah.

834
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:39,016
And I ended up out here
in San Francisco, unemployed...

835
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:42,018
which is the entire story
of my life...

836
00:58:42,144 --> 00:58:44,521
up until tonight.

837
00:58:58,327 --> 00:59:01,204
Here's to you. Salute.

838
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:04,207
You don't like me
very much, do you?

839
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:07,210
You don't want to
talk to me or anything.

840
00:59:07,336 --> 00:59:08,754
I didn't say that.

841
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:23,727
Something is on your mind.

842
00:59:23,853 --> 00:59:25,729
I wish you'd tell me.

843
00:59:25,855 --> 00:59:27,231
I really do.

844
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:30,192
I wish that you'd feel
that you could talk to me...

845
00:59:30,318 --> 00:59:32,695
and that we could be friends.

846
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:36,532
I mean aside from
all of this junk.

847
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:01,014
Would you, um...

848
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:05,227
If you were a girl who'd
waited for someone...

849
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:16,488
You can trust me.

850
01:00:19,367 --> 01:00:22,244
Well, you never really knew...

851
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:25,247
when he was going to
come to see you.

852
01:00:25,373 --> 01:00:27,750
You just lived in a room alone...

853
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:30,168
and you knew nothing about him.

854
01:00:30,294 --> 01:00:32,170
And if you loved him...

855
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:34,172
and were patient with him...

856
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:37,175
and even though
he didn't dare ever...

857
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:40,679
tell you anything
about himself personally...

858
01:00:42,807 --> 01:00:45,184
Even though he may
have loved you...

859
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:47,185
would you...

860
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:49,688
Would I what?

861
01:00:49,814 --> 01:00:51,190
Would you...

862
01:00:52,817 --> 01:00:55,361
Would you go back to him?

863
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:02,200
Well, how would I know...

864
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:05,620
How would I know
that he loved me?

865
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:16,214
You'd have no way of knowing.

866
01:01:28,769 --> 01:01:30,145
Hey, Harry!

867
01:01:30,271 --> 01:01:33,649
Did you hear the one about
the broad who busted Vegas?

868
01:01:33,774 --> 01:01:35,692
She wore a see-through blouse.

869
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,177
Where are you going?

870
01:02:02,303 --> 01:02:05,097
Hey! Hey!

871
01:02:34,794 --> 01:02:37,296
You know something, Harry?

872
01:02:37,421 --> 01:02:40,173
12 years ago, I recorded
every telephone call...

873
01:02:40,299 --> 01:02:42,175
made by the
presidential nominee...

874
01:02:42,301 --> 01:02:44,177
of a major political party.

875
01:02:44,303 --> 01:02:45,679
I don't want to say which party.

876
01:02:45,805 --> 01:02:48,182
Everywhere he went,
that's where I was.

877
01:02:48,307 --> 01:02:50,058
Coast to coast, I was listening.

878
01:02:50,184 --> 01:02:52,060
I'm not saying I elected...

879
01:02:52,186 --> 01:02:54,646
the president of
the United States...

880
01:02:54,772 --> 01:02:57,065
but you can draw
your own conclusions.

881
01:02:57,191 --> 01:02:59,693
I mean, he lost.

882
01:02:59,819 --> 01:03:01,695
Harry, tell them
about the time...

883
01:03:01,821 --> 01:03:03,781
you put the bug
in the parakeet.

884
01:03:03,906 --> 01:03:04,781
Parakeet?

885
01:03:04,907 --> 01:03:06,241
No kidding.

886
01:03:06,367 --> 01:03:09,244
Harry one time actually
put a microphone...

887
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:10,746
in a little parakeet.

888
01:03:10,872 --> 01:03:12,248
Is that right?

889
01:03:12,373 --> 01:03:14,708
Parakeets don't happen
to be my thing...

890
01:03:14,834 --> 01:03:17,211
but I sure would
like to know...

891
01:03:17,336 --> 01:03:20,213
how you did
the teamster local back in '68.

892
01:03:20,339 --> 01:03:21,715
What was that?

893
01:03:21,841 --> 01:03:24,718
Don't you get papers
in Chicago, Millard?

894
01:03:24,844 --> 01:03:26,220
Probably out on strike.

895
01:03:26,345 --> 01:03:28,638
It was all over the front pages.

896
01:03:28,764 --> 01:03:31,141
Harry was working
for the attorney general.

897
01:03:31,267 --> 01:03:34,144
You didn't know I knew, did you?

898
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:36,647
The president of
this teamster local...

899
01:03:36,772 --> 01:03:39,149
set up a phoney welfare fund.

900
01:03:39,275 --> 01:03:42,653
I mean, you correct me
on the details, Harry.

901
01:03:42,778 --> 01:03:45,155
I may be a little fuzzy.

902
01:03:45,281 --> 01:03:47,157
Only two people seemed to know...

903
01:03:47,283 --> 01:03:49,159
the president and his accountant.

904
01:03:49,285 --> 01:03:51,578
They only talked about it
on fishing trips.

905
01:03:51,704 --> 01:03:53,080
On a private boat...

906
01:03:53,206 --> 01:03:55,666
That was the only place
they talked details.

907
01:03:55,791 --> 01:03:57,834
That boat was bug-proof.
That's a fact.

908
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,337
They wouldn't strike up
a conversation...

909
01:04:00,463 --> 01:04:03,340
if there was another boat
on the horizon.

910
01:04:03,466 --> 01:04:05,843
That didn't stop Harry, did it?

911
01:04:05,968 --> 01:04:07,344
No, he recorded everything.

912
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:09,180
Nobody knows
how you did it though.

913
01:04:09,305 --> 01:04:11,181
Caused a hell of a scandal.

914
01:04:11,307 --> 01:04:12,558
Why?

915
01:04:12,683 --> 01:04:15,185
No reason.
Three people were murdered.

916
01:04:15,311 --> 01:04:19,481
Harry's a bit too modest
to tell us how he did it.

917
01:04:22,318 --> 01:04:24,194
It had nothing to do with me.

918
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,697
I just turned in the tapes.

919
01:04:26,822 --> 01:04:29,157
The president thought
the accountant talked.

920
01:04:29,283 --> 01:04:31,159
Nobody really knows for sure.

921
01:04:31,285 --> 01:04:32,661
Three days later...

922
01:04:32,787 --> 01:04:35,664
they found the accountant,
his wife, and kid...

923
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:38,667
naked and tied up in the house...

924
01:04:38,793 --> 01:04:41,670
Hands and feet
tied up with rope...

925
01:04:41,796 --> 01:04:44,173
all the hair on their bodies
shaved off.

926
01:04:44,298 --> 01:04:46,675
The heads were found
in different places.

927
01:04:46,801 --> 01:04:48,177
They killed them?

928
01:04:48,302 --> 01:04:49,678
No. They gift-wrapped them.

929
01:04:49,804 --> 01:04:51,680
This is ancient history now.

930
01:04:51,806 --> 01:04:53,182
Harry, how'd you do it?

931
01:04:53,307 --> 01:04:56,685
What they do with the tapes
is their business.

932
01:04:56,811 --> 01:05:00,689
Next thing I knew,
you moved out of New York.

933
01:05:00,815 --> 01:05:03,192
It had nothing to do with me.

934
01:05:03,317 --> 01:05:05,694
Come on, show and tell.
How'd you do it?

935
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:07,863
For God's sake, tell him.

936
01:05:12,827 --> 01:05:14,203
Turn it off, Stan.

937
01:05:14,328 --> 01:05:15,537
What for?

938
01:05:15,663 --> 01:05:17,873
Stan, turn it off.

939
01:05:17,999 --> 01:05:20,042
They ought to hear this.

940
01:05:20,168 --> 01:05:22,211
It's the best thing
you've ever done.

941
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:28,133
What was that, Stan?

942
01:05:29,969 --> 01:05:34,640
Well, it's the assignment
that Harry did this week.

943
01:05:34,765 --> 01:05:36,141
It'll make history.

944
01:05:36,267 --> 01:05:37,643
Yeah?

945
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:41,146
There's no moment between
human beings that I cannot record...

946
01:05:41,272 --> 01:05:44,817
and there's no method
that I cannot figure out.

947
01:05:44,942 --> 01:05:47,819
I could figure out
any of Harry's schemes, right?

948
01:05:47,945 --> 01:05:50,572
Come on, come on. Try me.

949
01:05:50,698 --> 01:05:53,575
Let me give him
the assignment, Harry.

950
01:05:53,701 --> 01:05:55,869
Yeah.

951
01:06:00,875 --> 01:06:04,253
This is a quad
in the centre of the city.

952
01:06:04,378 --> 01:06:06,755
These are steps,
benches all around.

953
01:06:06,881 --> 01:06:08,257
It's 12:00 noon...

954
01:06:08,382 --> 01:06:10,258
which means
that it's lunchtime...

955
01:06:10,384 --> 01:06:13,261
for the people working
in these offices.

956
01:06:13,387 --> 01:06:15,263
They're walking, talking,
having lunch...

957
01:06:15,389 --> 01:06:16,765
and it's crowded.

958
01:06:16,891 --> 01:06:18,267
Naturally. Come on, Stan.

959
01:06:18,392 --> 01:06:21,269
Okay. Two people are constantly
moving in circles...

960
01:06:21,395 --> 01:06:23,271
in and out of the crowd.

961
01:06:23,397 --> 01:06:25,982
We don't know whether
they'll sit down or what.

962
01:06:26,067 --> 01:06:28,277
They're convinced
they can't be recorded...

963
01:06:28,402 --> 01:06:31,780
because they're in a crowd
and constantly moving.

964
01:06:31,906 --> 01:06:33,282
Yet, they're the target.

965
01:06:33,407 --> 01:06:35,700
The assignment is
to get everything they say.

966
01:06:35,826 --> 01:06:37,786
How would you do it?

967
01:06:37,912 --> 01:06:39,788
One system won't do it.

968
01:06:39,914 --> 01:06:41,790
I could've told you that.

969
01:06:41,916 --> 01:06:43,292
Why didn't you?

970
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:45,293
Go on, figure it out.

971
01:06:45,419 --> 01:06:47,212
You get to their clothes first.

972
01:06:47,338 --> 01:06:48,714
You pre-rig their clothes.

973
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,716
There's no way of telling...

974
01:06:50,842 --> 01:06:52,134
what they're
going to be wearing.

975
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:54,637
Get somebody to bump into them.

976
01:06:54,762 --> 01:06:58,056
Get a drunk to plant
a pin mike on them.

977
01:06:58,182 --> 01:07:00,350
They've been bugged before.
It's too risky.

978
01:07:00,476 --> 01:07:01,727
I got it.

979
01:07:02,937 --> 01:07:05,731
You hire a lip-reader
with binoculars.

980
01:07:05,857 --> 01:07:08,734
No. The client wants
their actual voice.

981
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:10,736
Why?

982
01:07:10,862 --> 01:07:12,655
So he can believe it.

983
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:15,157
All right. I'll figure it out.

984
01:07:15,283 --> 01:07:18,244
I don't know.
It must've been an expensive show.

985
01:07:18,369 --> 01:07:19,745
Who was so interested?

986
01:07:19,871 --> 01:07:21,247
Yeah, was it us?

987
01:07:21,372 --> 01:07:22,247
Who's us?

988
01:07:22,373 --> 01:07:23,248
Federal government.

989
01:07:23,374 --> 01:07:24,249
Private party.

990
01:07:24,375 --> 01:07:27,252
It would take
at least four passes.

991
01:07:27,378 --> 01:07:29,254
I did it in three.

992
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:32,257
Three? That's very nice.
What did you use?

993
01:07:32,383 --> 01:07:33,759
Three-stage directional
microphones...

994
01:07:33,885 --> 01:07:36,762
with Mosfet amplifier
of my own design.

995
01:07:36,888 --> 01:07:39,765
We got another 20% conventionally
just tailing them.

996
01:07:39,891 --> 01:07:40,766
Paul did.

997
01:07:40,892 --> 01:07:43,686
It was beautiful.
It really was.

998
01:07:43,811 --> 01:07:46,188
It was a work of art.

999
01:07:46,314 --> 01:07:48,691
You should have
seen it, though.

1000
01:07:48,816 --> 01:07:50,275
These new microphones
are just incredible.

1001
01:07:50,401 --> 01:07:52,194
I couldn't believe it myself.

1002
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,196
We were 200 yards away.

1003
01:07:54,322 --> 01:07:55,698
It was absolutely readable.

1004
01:07:55,823 --> 01:07:57,950
I broke in a couple
of newsreel cameramen.

1005
01:07:58,075 --> 01:07:59,451
You should have
been there, Bernie.

1006
01:07:59,577 --> 01:08:00,869
What did they do?

1007
01:08:00,995 --> 01:08:03,288
They took the cross hairs
of the telescope...

1008
01:08:03,414 --> 01:08:05,791
and lined it up on the mouths...

1009
01:08:05,917 --> 01:08:08,794
No. The boy and the girl.
What did they do?

1010
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,296
Oh, I don't know.

1011
01:08:10,421 --> 01:08:12,798
But it was beautiful,
something to see.

1012
01:08:12,924 --> 01:08:14,300
Yeah. Sounds very pretty.

1013
01:08:14,425 --> 01:08:17,302
I'd like to take
a look at that mike, too.

1014
01:08:17,428 --> 01:08:18,804
There it is.

1015
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:20,306
Oh.

1016
01:08:20,431 --> 01:08:23,559
I always said
we should be partners, Harry.

1017
01:08:23,684 --> 01:08:27,312
You're the best, but you
and me together, that'd be tops.

1018
01:08:27,438 --> 01:08:31,233
I need a quick look at
your plans and devices.

1019
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,277
I got all the
manufacturing plants.

1020
01:08:33,402 --> 01:08:36,238
We could make a fortune
selling to Uncle Sam.

1021
01:08:36,364 --> 01:08:39,241
Did you hear about
the fag wiretapper...

1022
01:08:39,367 --> 01:08:42,244
who could only tap
a Princess phone?

1023
01:08:42,370 --> 01:08:43,287
No.

1024
01:08:46,874 --> 01:08:48,750
Made that up yourself, huh?

1025
01:08:48,876 --> 01:08:51,253
It's pretty funny.

1026
01:08:51,379 --> 01:08:52,755
Can I cut in?

1027
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,757
He's got a hell
of a sense of humour.

1028
01:08:55,883 --> 01:08:57,759
I'm talking about
making millions...

1029
01:08:57,885 --> 01:08:59,761
he's making with the jokes.

1030
01:08:59,887 --> 01:09:00,762
Come on!

1031
01:09:00,888 --> 01:09:02,264
Thanks a lot.

1032
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:04,266
What do you say, Harry?

1033
01:09:04,392 --> 01:09:06,769
How about going
into a partnership?

1034
01:09:06,894 --> 01:09:09,771
I could use a partner,
so could you.

1035
01:09:09,897 --> 01:09:11,273
50-50, how about it?

1036
01:09:11,399 --> 01:09:13,109
I don't need anyone.

1037
01:09:13,234 --> 01:09:14,610
That's all right.

1038
01:09:14,735 --> 01:09:17,612
I do pretty good
on my own, anyway.

1039
01:09:17,738 --> 01:09:21,116
You got to give credit
where credit's due, right?

1040
01:09:21,242 --> 01:09:22,117
Abracadabra, Harry.

1041
01:09:22,243 --> 01:09:24,119
See, I'm number two, Harry.

1042
01:09:24,245 --> 01:09:26,121
I have to try harder.

1043
01:09:26,247 --> 01:09:29,250
Would you, um...
If you were a girl...

1044
01:09:29,375 --> 01:09:30,751
who'd waited for someone...

1045
01:09:30,877 --> 01:09:32,253
You can trust me.

1046
01:09:32,378 --> 01:09:35,756
Harry, that's you and me
when we were out there.

1047
01:09:35,882 --> 01:09:37,758
What? No shit. Ha ha ha.

1048
01:09:37,884 --> 01:09:41,262
It's the Moran Super P-7
pen mike and transmitter.

1049
01:09:41,387 --> 01:09:42,554
That's terrific!

1050
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,556
The bugger got bugged, huh?

1051
01:09:44,682 --> 01:09:46,058
He got you, Harry.

1052
01:09:46,184 --> 01:09:49,061
And if you loved him
and were patient with him...

1053
01:09:49,187 --> 01:09:52,273
and even though
he didn't dare ever...

1054
01:09:52,398 --> 01:09:55,567
tell you anything about
himself personally...

1055
01:09:55,693 --> 01:09:57,069
Hey, touché, Harry.

1056
01:09:57,195 --> 01:09:59,572
That's wild.
When did you do that?

1057
01:09:59,697 --> 01:10:03,575
How do you like it?
What do you think?

1058
01:10:03,701 --> 01:10:08,664
Would you...
Would you go back to him?

1059
01:10:08,789 --> 01:10:11,875
I think you better
turn it off and get out.

1060
01:10:12,001 --> 01:10:15,879
Are you kidding? It's just
a joke, for Christ's sakes.

1061
01:10:16,005 --> 01:10:19,383
Bernie, Harry don't like you
to say "Christ's sakes."

1062
01:10:19,509 --> 01:10:22,845
Well, I'm sorry, Harry.
Are you crazy, too, Stanley?

1063
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:23,845
What's wrong?

1064
01:10:23,971 --> 01:10:25,847
Let's have a party here.

1065
01:10:25,973 --> 01:10:27,349
Paul, it's getting late.

1066
01:10:27,475 --> 01:10:29,185
Come on, take it easy.

1067
01:10:29,310 --> 01:10:30,185
Come on.

1068
01:10:30,311 --> 01:10:31,186
Hey, Millard.

1069
01:10:31,312 --> 01:10:33,188
Know what these things cost?

1070
01:10:33,314 --> 01:10:34,690
This cost 1.500 beans.

1071
01:10:34,815 --> 01:10:36,691
On the house, from me to you.

1072
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:41,280
Very nice to meet you.

1073
01:10:43,282 --> 01:10:44,741
It's only a joke.

1074
01:10:44,867 --> 01:10:46,243
Meredith?

1075
01:10:46,369 --> 01:10:47,745
He's got no sense of humour.

1076
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:50,247
No. I'm going to stay here.

1077
01:10:50,373 --> 01:10:51,290
Paul!

1078
01:10:52,875 --> 01:10:54,126
Okay.

1079
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:58,964
I forgot my bag.

1080
01:11:01,217 --> 01:11:02,593
Harry, I'm really sorry.

1081
01:11:02,718 --> 01:11:04,261
I didn't mean anything.

1082
01:11:04,387 --> 01:11:05,763
Come on, Stan.

1083
01:11:05,888 --> 01:11:07,764
See you Monday, Harry.

1084
01:11:07,890 --> 01:11:10,851
You want us to
put the lights out?

1085
01:11:29,871 --> 01:11:30,746
Night, Harry!

1086
01:11:30,872 --> 01:11:33,249
Yeah. Goodnight, Harry.

1087
01:11:38,212 --> 01:11:39,588
What do you think?

1088
01:11:39,714 --> 01:11:42,591
I don't know what
I'm going to get him...

1089
01:11:42,717 --> 01:11:43,759
for Christmas yet.

1090
01:11:43,885 --> 01:11:45,261
He's already got everything.

1091
01:11:51,392 --> 01:11:55,270
Harry, are you going to give me
a hard time tonight?

1092
01:11:55,396 --> 01:11:56,855
# When the red,
red robin #

1093
01:11:56,981 --> 01:11:58,357
Harry!

1094
01:11:58,482 --> 01:11:59,774
Harry!

1095
01:11:59,901 --> 01:12:01,277
Come on. Come back.

1096
01:12:01,402 --> 01:12:03,278
Turn it off.

1097
01:12:03,404 --> 01:12:05,280
# Goes bob, bob, bobbin' along #

1098
01:12:05,406 --> 01:12:06,448
# When the red, red robin #

1099
01:12:06,574 --> 01:12:12,121
# Goes bob, bob, bobbin' along #

1100
01:12:13,748 --> 01:12:16,792
# Wake up, wake up,
you sleepyhead #

1101
01:12:16,918 --> 01:12:18,461
She's frightened.

1102
01:12:18,586 --> 01:12:20,296
This is where she's frightened.

1103
01:12:20,421 --> 01:12:22,798
I don't know what
I'm going to get him...

1104
01:12:22,924 --> 01:12:24,300
for Christmas yet.

1105
01:12:24,425 --> 01:12:25,968
This is no ordinary conversation.

1106
01:12:26,093 --> 01:12:27,969
He doesn't need anything any more.

1107
01:12:28,095 --> 01:12:29,721
It makes me feel...

1108
01:12:29,847 --> 01:12:33,725
I haven't decided
what I'm going to get you yet.

1109
01:12:33,851 --> 01:12:34,726
Something.

1110
01:12:34,852 --> 01:12:36,228
Forget it, Harry.

1111
01:12:36,354 --> 01:12:37,730
It's only a trick.

1112
01:12:37,855 --> 01:12:39,231
What?

1113
01:12:39,357 --> 01:12:40,274
A job.

1114
01:12:40,399 --> 01:12:42,734
You're not supposed
to feel anything.

1115
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:45,237
You're just supposed to do it.

1116
01:12:45,363 --> 01:12:46,739
That's all.

1117
01:12:46,864 --> 01:12:47,739
Relax, honey.

1118
01:12:47,865 --> 01:12:50,242
A lot of fun you are.

1119
01:12:50,368 --> 01:12:51,744
You're supposed to tease me...

1120
01:12:51,869 --> 01:12:53,745
give me hints, make me guess.

1121
01:12:53,871 --> 01:12:54,746
You know.

1122
01:12:55,873 --> 01:12:57,249
Does it bother you?

1123
01:12:57,375 --> 01:12:58,250
What?

1124
01:12:58,376 --> 01:13:00,252
Walking around in circles.

1125
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:06,758
Oh, look, that's terrible.

1126
01:13:06,884 --> 01:13:08,760
He's not hurting anyone.

1127
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:13,766
Neither are we.

1128
01:13:17,395 --> 01:13:18,270
Oh, God.

1129
01:13:18,396 --> 01:13:19,271
"Oh, God."

1130
01:13:19,397 --> 01:13:22,775
Listen to the way
she says "Oh, God."

1131
01:13:24,902 --> 01:13:25,944
Come here.

1132
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:28,697
Every time I see
one of those old guys...

1133
01:13:28,823 --> 01:13:31,700
I always think the same thing.

1134
01:13:31,826 --> 01:13:33,702
What do you think?

1135
01:13:33,828 --> 01:13:35,204
I always think...

1136
01:13:35,329 --> 01:13:38,248
that he was once
somebody's baby boy.

1137
01:13:40,334 --> 01:13:42,002
Really. I... I do.

1138
01:13:42,128 --> 01:13:45,005
I think he was once
somebody's baby boy...

1139
01:13:45,131 --> 01:13:49,009
and he had a mother
and a father who loved him.

1140
01:13:49,135 --> 01:13:53,013
And now there he is,
half dead on a park bench...

1141
01:13:53,139 --> 01:13:55,516
and where are his
mother or his father...

1142
01:13:55,641 --> 01:13:57,517
all his uncles now?

1143
01:13:57,643 --> 01:14:00,020
Anyway, that's what
I always think.

1144
01:14:02,356 --> 01:14:03,732
I always think...

1145
01:14:03,858 --> 01:14:06,235
how, when they had
the newspaper strike...

1146
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:07,235
in New York...

1147
01:14:07,361 --> 01:14:09,237
more of those old guys died.

1148
01:14:09,363 --> 01:14:11,740
50 of them froze
to death in one night.

1149
01:14:11,866 --> 01:14:14,243
Just because there were
no newspapers?

1150
01:14:14,368 --> 01:14:16,745
Really. Keeps them warm.

1151
01:14:16,871 --> 01:14:18,789
Well, that's terrible.

1152
01:14:20,374 --> 01:14:22,501
Who started this
conversation, anyhow?

1153
01:14:24,879 --> 01:14:26,255
You did.

1154
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:27,756
Did not.

1155
01:14:27,882 --> 01:14:29,216
Yes, you did.

1156
01:14:29,342 --> 01:14:31,344
You just don't remember it.

1157
01:14:32,845 --> 01:14:35,722
Pretend like I just
told you a joke.

1158
01:14:39,352 --> 01:14:41,228
Where did you hear that?

1159
01:14:41,354 --> 01:14:42,730
That's my secret.

1160
01:14:44,357 --> 01:14:47,234
Later in the week.

1161
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:48,235
Sunday, maybe.

1162
01:14:50,363 --> 01:14:52,239
Sunday, definitely.

1163
01:14:54,367 --> 01:14:56,243
The Jack Tar Hotel.

1164
01:14:58,371 --> 01:15:00,748
3:00. Room 773.

1165
01:15:00,873 --> 01:15:03,166
Look, Mark. Do you see him?

1166
01:15:03,292 --> 01:15:05,168
The man with the hearing aid
like Charles.

1167
01:15:05,294 --> 01:15:06,503
No. Where?

1168
01:15:06,629 --> 01:15:09,506
Right there,
with the shopping bag.

1169
01:15:09,632 --> 01:15:11,508
He's been following us
all around...

1170
01:15:11,634 --> 01:15:13,761
and he's following us close.

1171
01:15:13,886 --> 01:15:16,763
It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.

1172
01:15:19,392 --> 01:15:21,268
# When the red, red robin #

1173
01:15:21,394 --> 01:15:24,271
# Goes bob, bob, bobbin' along #

1174
01:15:24,397 --> 01:15:25,272
# Along #

1175
01:15:25,398 --> 01:15:26,273
Angel...

1176
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:29,693
God, it will be so good...

1177
01:15:29,819 --> 01:15:32,696
to be finished with all this.

1178
01:15:32,822 --> 01:15:34,240
I love you.

1179
01:15:35,324 --> 01:15:36,700
It's all right, baby.

1180
01:15:36,826 --> 01:15:38,160
It's all right.

1181
01:15:38,286 --> 01:15:40,162
We're spending too much
time together here.

1182
01:15:40,288 --> 01:15:43,165
No. Let's stay
just a little longer.

1183
01:15:46,919 --> 01:15:48,253
"Kill us."

1184
01:15:49,338 --> 01:15:52,215
He'd kill them
if he had a chance.

1185
01:15:52,341 --> 01:15:54,843
He'd kill us if he got the chance.

1186
01:15:54,969 --> 01:15:56,845
Oh, God. What have I done?

1187
01:15:56,971 --> 01:15:59,848
I have to destroy the tapes.

1188
01:15:59,974 --> 01:16:02,851
I can't let it happen again.

1189
01:16:02,977 --> 01:16:05,854
I better get back.
It's almost 2:00.

1190
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,231
Oh, please, don't go.

1191
01:16:07,356 --> 01:16:10,442
A family was murdered
because of me.

1192
01:16:11,861 --> 01:16:12,778
I know.

1193
01:16:13,863 --> 01:16:15,239
I know, Harry.

1194
01:16:15,364 --> 01:16:16,782
Everything will turn out.

1195
01:16:18,367 --> 01:16:21,244
Oh, God. There's no protection.

1196
01:16:21,370 --> 01:16:23,747
I follow them
wherever they're going.

1197
01:16:23,873 --> 01:16:25,249
And I can hear them.

1198
01:16:25,374 --> 01:16:26,583
Bye-bye.

1199
01:16:26,709 --> 01:16:28,711
Oh, wait, you have
something in your eye.

1200
01:16:28,836 --> 01:16:29,711
Yeah?

1201
01:16:29,837 --> 01:16:31,213
You really don't.

1202
01:16:31,339 --> 01:16:33,716
I just wanted to kiss you.

1203
01:16:33,841 --> 01:16:35,217
I forgive you.

1204
01:16:35,343 --> 01:16:36,719
I forgive you, darling.

1205
01:16:36,844 --> 01:16:39,179
I forgive you.

1206
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:10,145
Listen.

1207
01:18:10,271 --> 01:18:13,023
Listen. My name is Harry Caul.

1208
01:18:14,942 --> 01:18:16,485
Can you hear me?

1209
01:18:18,446 --> 01:18:20,489
Don't be afraid.

1210
01:18:20,615 --> 01:18:24,493
I... I know you don't
know who I am...

1211
01:18:24,619 --> 01:18:25,995
but I know you.

1212
01:18:27,622 --> 01:18:30,249
There isn't much
to say about myself.

1213
01:18:30,374 --> 01:18:31,249
I...

1214
01:18:41,385 --> 01:18:43,553
Sick when I was a boy.

1215
01:18:44,889 --> 01:18:48,267
I was very sick
when I was a boy.

1216
01:18:48,392 --> 01:18:52,270
I was paralyzed in my left arm
and my left leg.

1217
01:18:52,396 --> 01:18:54,106
I couldn't walk for six months.

1218
01:18:54,232 --> 01:18:57,610
One doctor said that
I'd probably never walk again.

1219
01:19:00,404 --> 01:19:02,114
My mother...

1220
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:05,117
My mother used to
lower me into a hot bath.

1221
01:19:05,243 --> 01:19:07,119
It was therapy.

1222
01:19:08,746 --> 01:19:09,955
One time the doorbell rang...

1223
01:19:10,081 --> 01:19:12,458
and she went down to answer it.

1224
01:19:12,583 --> 01:19:13,792
I started sliding down.

1225
01:19:13,918 --> 01:19:15,294
I could feel the water.

1226
01:19:15,419 --> 01:19:18,296
It started coming up
to my chin, to my nose.

1227
01:19:18,422 --> 01:19:19,798
When I woke up...

1228
01:19:19,924 --> 01:19:22,801
my body was all greasy
from the holy oil...

1229
01:19:22,927 --> 01:19:24,803
she put on my body.

1230
01:19:24,929 --> 01:19:27,306
I remember being
disappointed I survived.

1231
01:19:27,431 --> 01:19:28,640
When I was 5...

1232
01:19:28,766 --> 01:19:31,560
my... my father introduced me
to a friend of his.

1233
01:19:31,686 --> 01:19:34,563
For no reason,
I hit him in the stomach.

1234
01:19:34,689 --> 01:19:36,565
He died a year later.

1235
01:19:37,733 --> 01:19:40,610
He'll kill you
if he gets a chance.

1236
01:19:43,865 --> 01:19:46,534
I'm not afraid of death.

1237
01:19:53,374 --> 01:19:55,667
I am afraid of murder.

1238
01:20:53,893 --> 01:20:54,768
Meredith?

1239
01:20:59,398 --> 01:21:00,273
Hey.

1240
01:21:45,152 --> 01:21:46,027
Bitch.

1241
01:22:03,379 --> 01:22:05,756
Good morning. May I help you?

1242
01:22:05,882 --> 01:22:07,258
Yes. Extension 765, please.

1243
01:22:07,383 --> 01:22:08,801
One moment, please.

1244
01:22:10,386 --> 01:22:11,637
Director's office.

1245
01:22:11,762 --> 01:22:15,098
I'd like to speak to
the director's assistant, please.

1246
01:22:15,224 --> 01:22:17,267
Mr Stett. Uh, Mr Martin Stett.

1247
01:22:17,393 --> 01:22:19,269
Mr Caul is on the line.

1248
01:22:19,395 --> 01:22:20,813
One moment, please.

1249
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:25,776
I'm sorry. That's impossible now.

1250
01:22:25,902 --> 01:22:27,778
Can we get back to you?

1251
01:22:27,904 --> 01:22:30,239
No, I... I... I have
to talk to him.

1252
01:22:30,364 --> 01:22:32,240
Can we have your name again?

1253
01:22:32,366 --> 01:22:33,241
Caul.

1254
01:22:33,367 --> 01:22:35,744
Would you mind spelling that?

1255
01:22:35,870 --> 01:22:38,247
C-A-U-L. Caul.

1256
01:22:38,372 --> 01:22:40,248
I'm putting you on hold.

1257
01:22:43,878 --> 01:22:46,255
Mr Caul, we'll get
right back to you.

1258
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:48,757
No. You don't have
my telephone number.

1259
01:22:48,883 --> 01:22:49,758
Hello?

1260
01:23:43,855 --> 01:23:44,730
Yes?

1261
01:23:44,856 --> 01:23:46,732
Mr Caul? This is Martin Stett.

1262
01:23:46,858 --> 01:23:48,734
How did you get this number?

1263
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:50,736
We prepare dossiers
on everyone...

1264
01:23:50,862 --> 01:23:53,239
who comes in contact
with the director.

1265
01:23:53,364 --> 01:23:55,741
You know that means
we've been watching you.

1266
01:23:55,867 --> 01:23:57,243
We have the tapes.

1267
01:23:57,368 --> 01:23:58,744
They're perfectly safe.

1268
01:23:58,870 --> 01:24:02,748
The director was anxious
to hear them as soon as possible.

1269
01:24:02,874 --> 01:24:05,251
You seemed to be...
I don't know... disturbed.

1270
01:24:05,376 --> 01:24:08,253
I couldn't risk
you destroying our tapes.

1271
01:24:08,379 --> 01:24:10,756
You understand,
don't you, Mr Caul?

1272
01:24:10,882 --> 01:24:14,594
Our tapes have nothing
to do with you.

1273
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:16,595
Why don't you come over now...

1274
01:24:16,721 --> 01:24:18,097
and bring the photographs?

1275
01:24:18,222 --> 01:24:19,514
The director's here...

1276
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:22,017
and he's prepared
to pay you in full.

1277
01:25:42,932 --> 01:25:46,310
Every time I see
one of those old guys...

1278
01:25:46,435 --> 01:25:47,811
I think the same thing.

1279
01:25:49,438 --> 01:25:51,314
What do you think?

1280
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:55,485
I always think that he
was once somebody's baby boy.

1281
01:25:55,611 --> 01:25:59,197
Really. I... I do.

1282
01:25:59,323 --> 01:26:01,992
He was once somebody's
baby boy...

1283
01:26:02,076 --> 01:26:05,621
and he had a mother
and father who loved him...

1284
01:26:05,746 --> 01:26:07,122
and now, there he is...

1285
01:26:07,248 --> 01:26:09,291
half dead on a park bench.

1286
01:26:09,417 --> 01:26:11,794
And where are his mother
or his father...

1287
01:26:11,919 --> 01:26:13,420
all his uncles now?

1288
01:26:14,922 --> 01:26:17,716
Anyway, that's what
I always think.

1289
01:26:19,594 --> 01:26:20,970
I always think...

1290
01:26:21,095 --> 01:26:23,972
how, when they had
the newspaper strike in New York...

1291
01:26:24,098 --> 01:26:25,724
more of those old guys died.

1292
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:28,727
50 of them froze to death
in one night.

1293
01:26:28,853 --> 01:26:31,146
Just because there were
no newspapers?

1294
01:26:31,272 --> 01:26:33,440
Really. Keeps them warm.

1295
01:26:33,566 --> 01:26:35,484
Sounds terrible.

1296
01:26:36,736 --> 01:26:40,072
Who started this
conversation anyhow?

1297
01:26:41,991 --> 01:26:42,950
You did.

1298
01:26:43,075 --> 01:26:44,993
Did not.

1299
01:26:45,119 --> 01:26:47,996
Yes, you did.
You just don't remember it.

1300
01:26:49,290 --> 01:26:52,167
Oh, Mark, it's all right.
We can talk.

1301
01:26:52,293 --> 01:26:54,169
I can't stand it.

1302
01:26:54,295 --> 01:26:56,338
I can't stand it any more.

1303
01:26:56,464 --> 01:26:59,091
You're going to make me cry.

1304
01:27:00,343 --> 01:27:03,220
I know, honey, I know. Me, too.

1305
01:27:03,346 --> 01:27:04,221
No, don't.

1306
01:27:04,347 --> 01:27:05,222
Oh, God.

1307
01:27:05,348 --> 01:27:07,350
You want to hear that again?

1308
01:27:07,475 --> 01:27:09,852
You want it to be true!

1309
01:27:09,977 --> 01:27:11,687
No, I don't.

1310
01:27:11,812 --> 01:27:13,688
I just want you to know...

1311
01:27:13,814 --> 01:27:15,315
whatever you need to know.

1312
01:27:15,441 --> 01:27:16,608
That's all.

1313
01:27:16,734 --> 01:27:18,777
Your money's on the table.

1314
01:27:20,863 --> 01:27:23,782
Do you think we can do this?

1315
01:27:25,076 --> 01:27:27,453
I'm tired of drinking anyhow.

1316
01:27:28,913 --> 01:27:30,998
I'm tired of mostly everything.

1317
01:27:31,123 --> 01:27:32,499
Tired of me?

1318
01:27:32,625 --> 01:27:34,001
Tired of you...

1319
01:27:34,126 --> 01:27:35,627
but not today.

1320
01:27:37,004 --> 01:27:38,505
Later in the week.

1321
01:27:38,631 --> 01:27:40,883
Sunday, maybe.

1322
01:27:43,344 --> 01:27:45,554
Sunday, definitely.

1323
01:27:50,852 --> 01:27:53,396
The Jack Tar Hotel.

1324
01:27:53,521 --> 01:27:54,396
3:00.

1325
01:27:54,522 --> 01:27:57,233
Room 773.

1326
01:27:57,358 --> 01:27:59,735
Look, Mark, do you see him...

1327
01:27:59,861 --> 01:28:02,238
the man with the hearing aid
like Charles?

1328
01:28:02,363 --> 01:28:03,322
No. Where?

1329
01:28:03,447 --> 01:28:06,575
Right there, with
the shopping bag.

1330
01:28:06,701 --> 01:28:08,869
Please count your money outside.

1331
01:28:08,995 --> 01:28:11,372
He's been following us all around.

1332
01:28:11,497 --> 01:28:13,790
He was following us close.

1333
01:28:13,916 --> 01:28:16,501
It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.

1334
01:28:22,049 --> 01:28:23,633
# When the red, red robin #

1335
01:28:23,759 --> 01:28:27,304
# Goes bob, bob, bobbin' along #

1336
01:28:27,430 --> 01:28:28,514
# Along #

1337
01:28:30,725 --> 01:28:33,102
God, it will be so good...

1338
01:28:33,227 --> 01:28:35,604
to be finished with all this.

1339
01:28:38,232 --> 01:28:39,650
I love you.

1340
01:28:42,987 --> 01:28:45,864
These are the pictures
you asked for.

1341
01:28:45,990 --> 01:28:48,409
We're spending
too much time together here.

1342
01:28:48,534 --> 01:28:50,911
No. Let's stay
just a little longer.

1343
01:28:51,037 --> 01:28:53,122
What will you do to her?

1344
01:28:53,247 --> 01:28:55,791
...kill us if he got the chance.

1345
01:28:58,753 --> 01:29:01,672
I think he's been
recording my telephone.

1346
01:29:03,758 --> 01:29:06,677
Listen, I'd better get back.
It's almost 2:00.

1347
01:29:06,802 --> 01:29:08,678
No, please don't go back there.

1348
01:29:08,804 --> 01:29:10,597
Not just yet.

1349
01:29:10,723 --> 01:29:14,977
All right.
All right, honey. I won't.

1350
01:29:19,106 --> 01:29:20,482
15.000 bucks.

1351
01:29:20,608 --> 01:29:24,862
That's not bad for a day's work,
is it, Mr Caul?

1352
01:29:24,987 --> 01:29:27,072
What'll he do with them?

1353
01:29:29,492 --> 01:29:30,534
We'll see.

1354
01:29:39,710 --> 01:29:43,547
...kill us if he got the chance.

1355
01:29:43,673 --> 01:29:45,716
# When the red, red robin #

1356
01:29:45,842 --> 01:29:49,262
# Goes bob, bob, bobbin' along #

1357
01:29:49,387 --> 01:29:50,554
# Along #

1358
01:29:53,724 --> 01:29:57,853
Later in the week.
Sunday, maybe.

1359
01:30:00,606 --> 01:30:02,482
Sunday, definitely.

1360
01:30:05,778 --> 01:30:07,446
The Jack Tar Hotel.

1361
01:30:08,990 --> 01:30:10,992
3:00.

1362
01:30:11,117 --> 01:30:13,119
Room 773.

1363
01:30:15,204 --> 01:30:16,371
Uh...

1364
01:30:16,497 --> 01:30:20,292
I wonder if you could give me
room 773.

1365
01:30:20,418 --> 01:30:22,461
773?

1366
01:30:23,838 --> 01:30:25,798
That is occupied, sir.

1367
01:30:29,177 --> 01:30:32,054
The rooms are all
basically the same, however.

1368
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:33,139
Well...

1369
01:30:36,392 --> 01:30:39,269
Do you have a room
that would be, uh...

1370
01:30:39,395 --> 01:30:40,771
adjoining, uh... close by?

1371
01:30:40,897 --> 01:30:42,565
Adjoining, just...

1372
01:30:42,690 --> 01:30:44,441
Yes, I do.

1373
01:30:44,567 --> 01:30:45,484
You do.

1374
01:34:56,569 --> 01:34:59,405
I'm tired of this lying,
all right?

1375
01:35:09,457 --> 01:35:11,500
I can't stand it.

1376
01:35:11,626 --> 01:35:13,919
I can't stand it any more.

1377
01:35:14,045 --> 01:35:16,422
You're going to make me cry.

1378
01:35:16,547 --> 01:35:19,299
I know. Me, too.

1379
01:35:19,425 --> 01:35:20,676
No, don't.

1380
01:35:20,801 --> 01:35:22,803
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1381
01:35:22,929 --> 01:35:24,513
No idea!

1382
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:26,515
This is horrible...

1383
01:35:29,852 --> 01:35:31,228
I love you.

1384
01:36:22,989 --> 01:36:26,450
Aah!

1385
01:36:28,327 --> 01:36:31,163
Aah!

1386
01:36:37,879 --> 01:36:40,214
It was stated that Nixon
would not deliver...

1387
01:36:40,339 --> 01:36:43,133
the State of the Union
message in person...

1388
01:36:54,061 --> 01:36:56,313
Will you cut that out?

1389
01:36:56,439 --> 01:36:59,316
How can you yell
at me like that?

1390
01:36:59,442 --> 01:37:00,818
And in my condition.

1391
01:37:00,943 --> 01:37:04,321
You're not fit to be
the father of my child.

1392
01:37:04,447 --> 01:37:05,823
Oh, what is this?

1393
01:37:05,948 --> 01:37:07,824
I'm trying to act like Wilma.

1394
01:37:07,950 --> 01:37:09,618
Well, you're overdoing it.

1395
01:37:13,956 --> 01:37:15,707
All right. Pull over.

1396
01:37:17,919 --> 01:37:19,420
What's the big rush?

1397
01:37:19,545 --> 01:37:21,755
I'm taking my wife
to the hospital.

1398
01:37:21,881 --> 01:37:23,257
She's having a baby.

1399
01:37:23,382 --> 01:37:25,092
I got to hand it to you.

1400
01:37:25,218 --> 01:37:26,510
You got intestinal fortitude.

1401
01:37:26,636 --> 01:37:27,637
Sit down, Fred.

1402
01:37:27,762 --> 01:37:31,515
You're wearing a groove
in the floor.

1403
01:37:31,641 --> 01:37:33,017
Look at Wilma out there.

1404
01:37:33,142 --> 01:37:35,018
How can she be so calm...

1405
01:37:35,144 --> 01:37:38,021
when she knows
what I'm going through?

1406
01:37:38,147 --> 01:37:39,523
How are you, Fred?

1407
01:37:39,649 --> 01:37:42,026
How do you think I am?

1408
01:37:42,151 --> 01:37:44,027
Betty, you go out there...

1409
01:37:44,153 --> 01:37:46,405
and tell Wilma if she doesn't...

1410
01:42:05,873 --> 01:42:06,957
Wait. Richard!

1411
01:42:07,041 --> 01:42:08,834
I want to see the director.

1412
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:10,544
He's not in today.

1413
01:42:11,754 --> 01:42:14,173
I'm afraid you'll
have to leave now.

1414
01:44:12,792 --> 01:44:14,168
Let's clear an aisle.

1415
01:44:14,293 --> 01:44:15,669
Let these people through.

1416
01:44:15,795 --> 01:44:17,171
Come on, clear the way.

1417
01:44:17,296 --> 01:44:18,672
We'll answer your
questions upstairs.

1418
01:44:18,798 --> 01:44:20,174
Let these people through.

1419
01:44:20,299 --> 01:44:21,800
Let these people through.

1420
01:44:21,926 --> 01:44:23,218
Just one question.

1421
01:44:23,344 --> 01:44:24,345
No, please.

1422
01:44:24,470 --> 01:44:27,097
Do you suspect foul play
in the accident?

1423
01:44:27,223 --> 01:44:29,058
What about your
corporate control?

1424
01:44:29,183 --> 01:44:31,059
Will your stock now give you...

1425
01:44:31,185 --> 01:44:32,060
controlling interest?

1426
01:44:32,186 --> 01:44:34,813
What kind of insurance
do you have?

1427
01:44:34,939 --> 01:44:36,148
That's an unfair question.

1428
01:44:40,945 --> 01:44:42,821
What do you think?

1429
01:44:42,947 --> 01:44:45,824
I don't know what
I'm getting him for Christmas.

1430
01:44:45,950 --> 01:44:48,327
He's already got everything.

1431
01:44:48,452 --> 01:44:51,413
Doesn't need anything any more.

1432
01:44:54,292 --> 01:44:57,336
Do you feel there's an enemy
within the company?

1433
01:45:00,173 --> 01:45:02,049
He's not hurting anybody.

1434
01:45:02,175 --> 01:45:04,844
Neither are we.

1435
01:45:04,969 --> 01:45:07,304
Oh, God.

1436
01:45:07,430 --> 01:45:08,305
...drunk driving?

1437
01:45:13,060 --> 01:45:14,352
I can't stand it.

1438
01:45:14,478 --> 01:45:17,522
I can't stand it any more.

1439
01:45:17,648 --> 01:45:18,732
Aah!

1440
01:45:20,860 --> 01:45:21,819
Take it!

1441
01:45:21,944 --> 01:45:23,612
Take it!

1442
01:45:28,743 --> 01:45:31,078
Do you think we can do this?

1443
01:45:31,204 --> 01:45:33,122
Later in the week.

1444
01:45:33,247 --> 01:45:36,083
Sunday, maybe.

1445
01:45:36,209 --> 01:45:39,086
Sunday, definitely.

1446
01:45:39,212 --> 01:45:41,005
The Jack Tar Hotel.

1447
01:45:42,340 --> 01:45:43,215
3:00.

1448
01:45:43,341 --> 01:45:45,384
Room 773.

1449
01:45:48,804 --> 01:45:51,723
He'd kill us if he got the chance.

1450
01:46:25,007 --> 01:46:26,258
Hello.

1451
01:46:28,010 --> 01:46:29,261
Hello.

1452
01:47:23,065 --> 01:47:24,399
Hello.

1453
01:47:31,949 --> 01:47:33,075
Hello.

1454
01:47:33,201 --> 01:47:35,912
We know that you know, Mr Caul.

1455
01:47:36,037 --> 01:47:38,914
For your own sake,
don't get involved any further.

1456
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:40,916
We'll be listening to you.
