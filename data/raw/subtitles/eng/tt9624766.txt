Twelve o'clock.

550
00:49:17,175 --> 00:49:19,478
By the time it gets to those
trees, it'll be dark.

551
00:49:20,878 --> 00:49:23,616
Fighting Brax in the
dark is not what we want.

552
00:49:23,649 --> 00:49:25,451
We want to bring the
fight to him before then.

553
00:49:27,852 --> 00:49:29,355
Thanks to you, we got to
climb up this hill

554
00:49:29,388 --> 00:49:30,989
with the Geiger counters.

555
00:49:31,022 --> 00:49:32,691
We got to find him,
we got to lure him out,

556
00:49:32,725 --> 00:49:33,925
get the edge.

557
00:49:35,661 --> 00:49:37,929
What happens after dark?

558
00:49:37,962 --> 00:49:40,299
If Brax doesn't square off
and kill us by then,

559
00:49:40,332 --> 00:49:42,334
the hole doesn't close
and he stays.

560
00:49:43,569 --> 00:49:44,836
Everyone dies.

561
00:49:45,304 --> 00:49:46,305
Everyone.

562
00:49:49,907 --> 00:49:52,311
You used to say the fight
was worth dying for, Jake.

563
00:49:53,845 --> 00:49:55,046
All the time.

564
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:57,181
I believed you.

565
00:49:59,485 --> 00:50:00,486
Try to keep up.

566
00:50:04,822 --> 00:50:06,558
A lot of us thought it would
be you who has the chance

567
00:50:06,592 --> 00:50:07,992
to take Brax out.

568
00:50:09,093 --> 00:50:11,262
You look puzzled.
Are you puzzled?

569
00:50:11,297 --> 00:50:13,898
I mean, I get it. I'm puzzled.
I'm real puzzled.

570
00:50:13,931 --> 00:50:16,769
There's a comet, there's a
portal, there's Brax.

571
00:50:16,801 --> 00:50:18,036
Why don't I remember
any of this?

572
00:50:18,069 --> 00:50:20,104
Don't worry so much about
what you don't remember.

573
00:50:20,138 --> 00:50:21,172
Which is
pretty much everything.

574
00:50:21,205 --> 00:50:22,608
The main thing
is to focus.

575
00:50:22,641 --> 00:50:24,710
- You remember how to do that?
- Maybe.

576
00:50:24,743 --> 00:50:26,512
Maybe?
You've been preparing

577
00:50:26,545 --> 00:50:27,912
for this fight
your entire life.

578
00:50:27,945 --> 00:50:29,947
That makes sense.
Fighting that son of a bitch

579
00:50:29,981 --> 00:50:31,115
makes all the sense
in the world.

580
00:50:31,149 --> 00:50:32,484
Yeah, you got
to fight him.

581
00:50:32,518 --> 00:50:33,885
Even if it kills you,
you got to fight him.

582
00:50:33,918 --> 00:50:35,487
You get your honor back.

583
00:50:35,521 --> 00:50:37,356
Now, Brax fights
nine fighters.

584
00:50:37,389 --> 00:50:39,625
Fight, fight, fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight, fight, fight,

585
00:50:39,658 --> 00:50:40,958
and then he goes home.

586
00:50:40,992 --> 00:50:43,127
But if any of the fighters
refuse to fight him,

587
00:50:43,629 --> 00:50:44,896
he devours.

588
00:50:44,929 --> 00:50:47,932
He devours anything that
walks, flies, crawls.

589
00:50:47,965 --> 00:50:51,069
I mean, he destroys
entire towns and villages.

590
00:50:51,102 --> 00:50:53,806
Now, you...
you, you, you, you, you.

591
00:50:53,838 --> 00:50:56,608
You maybe might actually
have to die.

592
00:50:56,642 --> 00:50:59,043
But as long
as you die bravely,

593
00:50:59,077 --> 00:51:00,646
no one else will have to.

594
00:51:00,679 --> 00:51:01,846
Not for another six years.

595
00:51:01,879 --> 00:51:05,917
That is alien politics
five through fifteen.

596
00:51:06,585 --> 00:51:07,919
You said
he fights nine.

597
00:51:07,952 --> 00:51:09,355
Why is there
only eight of us?

598
00:51:10,289 --> 00:51:11,824

don't worry so much

don't remember.

602
00:51:18,731 --> 00:51:19,931
Brax happened.

603
00:51:20,733 --> 00:51:22,133
Brax.

604
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:24,001

who that is, right?

605

go look for him?
