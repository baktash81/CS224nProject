NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:38,090
LENINGRAD. NOVEMBER 1, 1971

3
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,750
<i>I was born into</i>
<i>not the most close-knit of families.</i>

4
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,670
<i>I wasn't the best of students at school,</i>
<i>dropped out of college,</i>

5
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,130
<i>spent three years as a prison camp guard.</i>

6
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,380
<i>My name is Sergei Dovlatov.</i>

7
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,960
<i>When I was eight,</i>
<i>I told Mom I would be a writer.</i>

8
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,300
<i>Since then, it has been my priority.</i>

9
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,840
<i>The 1960s are over,</i>
<i>with their thaw period,</i>

10
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,710
<i>craving for perfection, relative freedom.</i>

11
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,000
<i>Someone must have said,</i>
<i>"Enough fun for now."</i>

12
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,380
<i>The 1970s came... and brought the frost.</i>

13
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,000
<i>Me and my writer friends can't get</i>
<i>published – at least not the things</i>

14
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,380
<i>that were written</i>
<i>sincerely and in earnest.</i>

15
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,960
<i>We are taboo.</i>

16
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,800
<i>The bigwigs pretend we don't exist,</i>
<i>and if you can't get published in the USSR</i>

17
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,460
<i>and you aren't a member</i>
<i>of the Writers' Union, you don't exist.</i>

18
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,420
<i>I'm tired of being nobody.</i>

19
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,420
<i>I don't know how,</i>

20
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,130
<i>but something has to change soon,</i>

21
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,590
<i>one way or another.</i>

22
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,000
<i>It's really weird.</i>

23
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,090
Sergei, are you going
to make up with your wife?

24
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,920
Do you want to die alone and miserable?

25
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,500
Haven't you had enough divorces?

26
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,800
Mom, I had a dream about Brezhnev again.

27
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,710
We were talking about
socialism and foreign drinks.

28
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,090
Your grandpa had a dream about Stalin
in 1937. He was afraid to go to sleep.

29
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,340
Then he got arrested.

30
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:30,210
Did you hear that... non-members
of the Writers' Union

31
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,090
will be banned even from newspapers?

32
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,050
Nonsense.

33
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,340
No, it's not.

34
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,880
Brodsky thought it wouldn't
come to the trial, but it did.

35
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,420
-Why is your hand swollen?
-A fight over Vvedensky's poetry.

36
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,840
Vvedensky and Kharms died
a horrible and stupid death.

37
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,920
You know, Brodsky is in trouble again.

38
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,210
Are you going to your pathetic newspaper
or asking for a job at the magazines?

39
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,750
You'd better stay home
and write your novel.

40
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,920
I can earn enough to feed us.
Let them go to hell.

41
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,380
The holiday is coming,
but I don't feel any joy.

42
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,000
Brazil – Guinea: 2-0, predictably.

43
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,000
Could you turn it down? We're not living
in a palazzo. We share this apartment.

44
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,130
Skeletons...

45
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,210
-What is a palazzo?
-A foreign mansion.

46
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,800
Skeletons, skeletons...

47
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,710
Lena, listen.
I had a dream about Brezhnev.

48
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,630
He was very friendly.

49
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,250
We were joking and riding together.
By the way, he likes piña colada.

50
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,250
I could tell them that Brezhnev
and I are friends

51
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,050
and we visit each other on weekends.

52
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,880
Mao promised to come, too.

53
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,670
No, Lena, I haven't been drinking lately.

54
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,130
No, not at all.

55
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,420
It's snowing and raining.
It's freezing inside.

56
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
-Sergei, are you ill?
-Lena.

57
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,750
I was trying to write all night.

58
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,420
Don't be so shallow.

59
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,000
A divorce doesn't mean
we aren't friends anymore.

60
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,130
I just wanted to know how you were.

61
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,460
Do you think I'm destroying
myself with all this fuss?

62
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,050
Something is lost.

63
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,130
Lena...

64
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:51,000
-Is it your polyps again?
-St. John's wort doesn't help.

65
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,670
Guelder rose is also good.

66
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,250
I was walking around
with the guys to warm up.

67
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,840
-Hey.
-Hello.

68
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,670
It's a big holiday. We need to celebrate.

69
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,880
Hi. Do you have cigarettes?

70
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,920
I left them at home. Can you give me one?

71
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,050
-No.
-OK, bye.

72
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:17,380
See that man? Ask him.

73
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:22,000
What is it? Are you all right?

74
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,500
What, Glasha?

75
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,800
They are getting ready
for the celebration. See?

76
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,340
But you and I don't care about it.

77
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,300
What?

78
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,170
Let's write a book together. A big one.

79
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,420
Let's go for a walk.

80
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:51,920
Hello.

81
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,670
These Zionists are out of control.
Golda Meir is a hawk. Do you agree?

82
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:43,000
These Zionists are out of control.
Golda Meir is a hawk. Do you agree?

83
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,670
-I'll tell them you said that.
-Tell who?

84
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:51,960
The Zionists.

85
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,710
-The humanists.
-What?

86
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,500
-The impressionists.
-What?

87
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,420
The abstractionists.

88
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,090
And the decadents, just in case.

89
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,630
-How are you?
-Fine.

90
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,880
Excuse me.

91
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,800
-You're fine?
-Yes.

92
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,800
-What is your name?
-Masha.

93
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,960
Masha? Hi, Masha.

94
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,840
How old are you?

95
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,340
-Eleven.
-Come again?

96
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,880
-Eleven.
-Eleven?

97
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,550
Looks grand, doesn't it?

98
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,130
How is your writing going?

99
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,500
They said at the editor's office

100
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,170
that your short stories won't come out
in the next two issues.

101
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,750
You can do more as a factory
newspaper's reporter.

102
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,750
Why did you quit? It was more decent.

103
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,670
The writing isn't going anywhere.

104
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,550
Do you think Montesquieu

105
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,380
would become Montesquieu
in our time with his <i>Persian Letters</i>?

106
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,750
I don't know. I'm going
to the Baltics as a photo reporter.

107
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,500
Maybe you should write books
or rhymes about animals for kids.

108
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,920
They are always in demand.

109
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,960
I'll think about it.

110
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,250
Sergei.

111
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,710
Thanks.

112
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,590
Sergei, hi.

113
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,920
Please talk to the guys. They are nervous.

114
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
They haven't been in front
of the camera before.

115
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,800
We need a big article about our film.

116
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,960
-A sincere one.
-Yes. OK.

117
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:57,920
Can we do it?

118
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,210
-Sure.
-Good.

119
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,460
Tanya, it's me.

120
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,550
-Sergei.
-Yuri.

121
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,420
This is Sergei from the factory newspaper.

122
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,250
In real life, I am senior economist.
Do I look like Gogol?

123
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,800
-They gave me a wig.
-Yes.

124
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,050
The mustache is real. I hope you'll
write something about the shooting.

125
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,210
-I will.
-Good.

126
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,590
-You will?
-Yes.

127
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,300
Do I look all right?

128
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,090
-Hello.
-Hi.

129
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,170
-Action.
-Can I start?

130
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:31,800
A year ago, we started the construction
of this amazing ship,

131
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,210
<i>Writer Platon Nifontov.</i>

132
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,380
Today, on the eve
of the Soviet country's birthday,

133
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:42,710
our editorial office decided to shoot
a film about this great ship.

134
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:49,000
Today, our wonderful poets will give
their blessings to the ship:

135
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,630
Aleksandr Pushkin, Leo Tolstoy,
Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky...

136
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,880
Fyodor Mikhailovich.

137
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,500
-Listen, I... Excuse me.
-Fyodor Mikhailovich.

138
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,500
I'm sorry. Can I start over?
I'll do better this time.

139
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,500
Fine.

140
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,460
-Hello.
-Hi. Pushkin.

141
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,130
Dostoevsky, Fyodor.

142
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,960
Nice to meet you. I read your books.

143
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,210
Fyodor Mikhailovich, I'm a reporter
with the factory newspaper

144
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,750
<i>Morskoy Put</i>, Sergei Dovlatov.

145
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Nice to meet you.

146
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,880
What would you, as the writer Dostoevsky,
tell the Soviet people?

147
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,500
Young pioneers, students,
Komsomol members?

148
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,090
From the sacral viewpoint.

149
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,710
I don't know what sacral means,
but the Soviet people should be proud.

150
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,340
-Proud.
-Yes, write it down.

151
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,500
Now, in the early 1970s,
we have virtually defeated greed.

152
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:40,250
This is due to
the <i>Crime and Punishment </i>book.

153
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,500
-Right?
-Right.

154
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,840
-I read it twice.
-Twice?

155
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,130
The second time, after school.

156
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,340
It's good that you read it after school.

157
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,670
-Thank you. This will be it.
-Yes. Thank you.

158
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,500
That was good, Vania.

159
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,920
You shouldn't talk
about Soviet people, though.

160
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,460
-You died in the 17th century.
-Nineteenth.

161
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,750
You weren't there.

162
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,300
-Right.
-I'm sorry.

163
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,380
Aleksandr Sergeievich,
I read your books, too.

164
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:11,710
Why didn't they name the ship
after the great poet Mandelstam?

165
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,880
Or Blok, or Pasternak?
Have you read Platon Nifontov, the writer?

166
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,050
What do you think as an actor
and a factory employee?

167
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,630
I never read Nifontov,
and I don't like Blok.

168
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,250
-Why?
-Because of his promiscuity and excesses.

169
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,340
Remember, "Crowned with a wreath
of roses white, comes Jesus Christ"?

170
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,590
Why Jesus? What does it mean?

171
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,130
White roses are a symbol
of a Soviet wedding.

172
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,000
Excuse me? The white roses are...

173
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,420
A symbol of our Soviet wedding.

174
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,590
That's great. Thank you.

175
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,460
-Sergei, are you OK here?
-Yes, sure.

176
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,170
Pushkin, there's another interview.

177
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,250
I'll take him.

178
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,500
Nice to meet you. Natasha Rostova.

179
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,590
They invited me just in case.

180
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:01,090
-They say I'm a fictional character.
-Not at all. You're quite real.

181
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Even better.

182
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,500
She is fat, and you're very pretty.

183
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,840
Thank you.

184
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,920
-Snezhana.
-Franz Kafka.

185
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,210
Nice to meet you.

186
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,750
I'm from the factory newspaper.

187
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,000
I write feuilletons
and work in entomology.

188
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,710
Are you from France?

189
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:18,920
No.

190
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,880
France is a capitalist country.
How would I be here?

191
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:25,340
Snezhana, don't trust him.
I know guys like him.

192
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,250
He's a regular petty reporter
from our factory newspaper.

193
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,750
He wants to take advantage of your youth.
Let's shoot this film.

194
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,840
Ania, we had good cognac somewhere.

195
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,750
-After the shooting, OK?
-After the shooting.

196
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,170
-Sergei, are you coming?
-Sorry, I can't.

197
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,800
-Maybe after...
-Thanks. I don't drink.

198
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,210
Thank you.

199
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,250
-Kafka?
-Yes, Kafka.

200
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,670
It's a weird name.

201
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:54,920
It is.

202
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,960
-Is it your mom's or dad's?
-Dad's.

203
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,800
-Franz, come to our place.
-Thank you, Snezhana.

204
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,130
It's fun.

205
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:09,920
Sure.

206
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,750
-Snezhana, please step aside.
-Why?

207
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:15,380
We are filming Leo Tolstoy. Please go.

208
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,300
-I'm Natasha Rostova.
-Please go, I said.

209
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,960
They won't let you be here?
Snezhana, stay. I'll talk to her.

210
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,420
OK. Just turn to this side.

211
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,750
Tolstoy. Go.

212
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:32,050
I want to talk about the great role played
by the Russian

213
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,340
and Soviet literatures

214
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:39,210
in forming the moral
character of a Soviet laborer.

215
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,920
A book isn't merely a source of knowledge.

216
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,210
It's a source of our enthusiasm,

217
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,710
of moral strength required

218
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,210
to build up a new society,

219
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,880
our future.

220
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,710
Lena, please don't be so unfriendly.

221
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,550
It's hard for me, too.

222
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,590
The short stories were easy,
and the novel isn't.

223
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,500
"I existed, I was thinking,
I disappeared like smoke."

224
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,880
Remember this poem?

225
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,210
You look bad.

226
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,670
Scruffy.

227
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,590
Funny.

228
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,090
Gogol and Pushkin offered me a drink today

229
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,550
but I refrained.

230
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:35,340
Poet Pushkin hates poet Blok
from religious considerations.

231
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,840
The Russian culture is all messed up.

232
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,250
Reality is mixed up with fiction.

233
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,460
And this stupid factory newspaper.

234
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,250
The world is going crazy.

235
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,960
Crazy becomes the new normal,
and normal feels like a miracle.

236
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,050
You're either selfish or very childish.

237
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,670
If you want to be alone, it's fine.

238
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,050
We'll get a divorce.

239
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,050
You are the reason for all this.

240
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,130
If you can't get published,
it's not an excuse to repel everyone.

241
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,170
We can make it.

242
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,920
Why did you fight with Yevtushenko?

243
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,920
You don't like his work – fine.
But why the drama?

244
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,460
I must be childish.

245
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:18,920
And I'm right about Yevtushenko.
Yevtushenko has stretchy narrow pants.

246
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:26,090
Do you like men wearing
narrow elastic pants?

247
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,250
With red socks and a bow on their heads.

248
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,500
Do you like it?

249
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,590
Katia!

250
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,840
Katia!

251
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,170
Lena?

252
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,800
Do you like it?

253
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,710
I don't like everything
Yevtushenko writes.

254
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,880
He has his moments.

255
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,250
-Daddy, hi.
-Hi.

256
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,630
Don't say hi, say "good evening."

257
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,340
How are you?

258
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,380
You need to decide.

259
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,500
Do you need a family or not?

260
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,210
Come on.

261
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,000
Will Mom take me for a walk tomorrow?

262
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
Yes, Mom will.

263
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,920
How are you doing?

264
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,750
Good. Alla got a new doll.

265
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,670
It's German. Almost as big as I am.

266
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,090
Dad, when will we live together?

267
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,750
Where did Alla get that doll?

268
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,880
Which store?

269
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:13,210
I don't know. Maybe the doll was sad,
and she came to her, just like you.

270
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,000
Do you want a doll like that?

271
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,170
No, Daddy. You have no money.

272
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,880
Mom says you are not pathetic but fragile.

273
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,090
Mom says you're very talented.

274
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,250
Why don't we go visit someone
and then go home?

275
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,550
Just a couple of hours,
and then you go back to Mom.

276
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,750
This is a new, unfinished thing.

277
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,420
"It's Saturday, and strangely warm.

278
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,630
The robins sing
as if it were a June night.

279
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,550
It's strange, because a day ago

280
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,130
hawthorn was scratching my window,

281
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:56,710
chased by wind,
but I wouldn't open my window.

282
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,130
Acacias were crackling,

283
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:02,960
and thunderclouds on fire
heralded the future frost.

284
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:06,550
But everything is fine,
and even the robin sings.

285
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:11,250
I've been plugging away
over the Czech poems..."

286
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,170
A collection of his poems
was published in America.

287
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,050
Brodsky is an old Jewish surname.
My uncle was Brodsky.

288
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,750
Anyway. Aronzon is a real poet. And this?

289
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,090
"...not that unusual for me. It's dark..."

290
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,590
How can one not like it?

291
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,420
One can.

292
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,340
-I like it.
-I don't like it. So?

293
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,300
Fine.

294
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,710
Katia, aren't you dancing?

295
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,630
Listen, Serge.

296
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:06,250
My editor says, "Write something
positive about electricity."

297
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,380
All I could think about
was electrification and defloration.

298
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,300
I offered to write about
a girl electrician. Smart, eh?

299
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,630
All these jokes are just
an illusion of life.

300
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,130
I humiliated myself again
at the editor's office.

301
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,710
We'll all get older until we become
decrepit greyhounds.

302
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,500
By the way, you stole my Faulkner.

303
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,460
Where can I get a big German doll?

304
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:28,960
How would I know?

305
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,380
-This is my scarf.
-Sorry.

306
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,340
Thanks.

307
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,960
Sholom. Are you sad?

308
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm a joke.

309
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,170
My salivary glands are blocked.

310
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,340
My doctor told me to eat lemons. I do.

311
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,800
Now my mom has a sad face,
and, for some reason, my cat.

312
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,380
I've been to the Academy recently.

313
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:00,050
They told me again:
"Dear Sholom, your paintings are rubbish."

314
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,960
Sholom, it's nonsense.
Answer them with contempt.

315
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,000
Sholom, you're a good painter.
Better than me.

316
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,630
-Come on.
-Get Sholom some port.

317
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,090
Three writers without books. Sergei, hi.

318
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,420
Do you have money?
I need to go to Arkhangelsk.

319
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
They commissioned me
with this stupid article.

320
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,800
I had a dream about Brezhnev.
He promised to help.

321
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,710
Then I'm at peace.

322
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,800
Your razor. Thank you.

323
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,300
You're welcome.

324
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,750
Nikolay.

325
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,590
Did you hear Brodsky? What do you think?

326
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,130
So-so. You?

327
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,550
I liked it. It was a beautiful poem.

328
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,420
In ten years,

329
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,840
there will be no Mandelstam,

330
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,170
and this Brodsky
will be forgotten even sooner.

331
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,050
Why be peevish? This is boring.

332
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,130
Bunin is a mediocre writer, for example.

333
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,250
They all wrote gloomy books
about our country.

334
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,460
-Don't talk about Brodsky like this.
-What have you...

335
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,630
Please stop this vulgar nonsense.

336
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,840
What gloom?

337
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:01,630
Aren't Mandelstam, Bunin, and Blok
the jewels of Russian literature?

338
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,050
Don't argue with Dad,
or he'll beat you up.

339
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,050
Sergei.

340
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,670
In the East, the new things
don't contradict or destroy the old ones.

341
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,840
Not in the slightest.

342
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,550
Let's go for a walk.

343
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,420
It's late.

344
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm tired.

345
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,920
I want to go home, you selfish man.

346
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,550
Get dressed.

347
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,250
-Sergei, hi.
-Hello.

348
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,960
-Do you recognize me?
-Of course I do.

349
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,250
We've met before.

350
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,840
You haven't read us your stories
for a while. Why?

351
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,170
I don't know.

352
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,050
Are you still writing them?

353
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,340
-Mom, come on.
-I am.

354
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,960
-Come up with something grand.
-Thank you.

355
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,050
A manifesto.

356
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:54,090
Manifestos aren't always belles lettres.
I'm trying to write a novel.

357
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,420
-I'm rereading Steinbeck.
-I believe in you.

358
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,090
-Mom, come on.
-You're very talented.

359
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,500
Why are you nagging people
with your questions?

360
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,090
I'm not.

361
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:05,090
Sergei. Come with me.
It was a horrible day.

362
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,210
I met an unimaginable woman.

363
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,000
She thinks Joyce is a foreign drink.

364
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,630
Is something wrong? You look pale.

365
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,710
-No, nothing.
-Do you want me to take a look?

366
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,000
Joseph, all you know about medicine
you learned working at the morgue.

367
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,630
Sholom Shvarts, a great artist.
Joseph Brodsky, an equally great poet.

368
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:33,550
Nice to meet you.

369
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:37,130
-Nikolay, another great artist.
-Joseph. Nice to meet you.

370
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,920
Sholom, don't tell Joseph about your
disease. He used to work at the morgue.

371
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,460
OK. We're out of here.

372
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,460
Dad, come on.

373
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,090
Let's go, Katia.

374
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:55,840
-Well? Where do we go next?
-Let's go drink some wine.

375
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,750
Wine? Here?

376
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,300
-Just one glass.
-Here.

377
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,300
Thank you.

378
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,750
-What's this?
-Chin-chin!

379
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,630
Is someone going to get me some wine?

380
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,460
This is nonsense. Come on.

381
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,920
This is ridiculous.

382
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,880
This is horrible.

383
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:33,670
I invited my friends to come to Leningrad
from the village I was exiled to.

384
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,380
They are nice people who helped me a lot.

385
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:39,880
I recited my poems to them,
and they understood.

386
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:44,130
But here it appears that
we are very different people.

387
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:46,800
Or maybe I'm different.

388
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:56,340
If I leave now,
nobody will ever let me come back.

389
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,880
We have only one motherland, right?

390
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,460
Emigrants are miserable people.

391
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,960
They are scared of everything.

392
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:07,960
You know...

393
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,210
I'm sorry. Is she heavy?

394
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,090
Sleep, baby. Sleep.

395
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,210
No.

396
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,800
I don't want to go.

397
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,590
-Go back to sleep.
-I won't go.

398
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,800
Language is the only thing that survives.

399
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:28,630
I think we are the last generation
able to save Russian literature.

400
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,880
They promised me a publication,
but I don't believe them.

401
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,300
-Your kid will freeze.
-Get on your way.

402
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,590
I'm not going to ask them.

403
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:49,050
Funny. I wanted to be a writer
and nothing else since I was eight.

404
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,130
When they sent me to guard prison camps,

405
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:56,250
I kept writing
among those convicts, in jail...

406
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,250
-You promised me...
-We even looked alike,

407
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,460
them and I, with our shaved heads.

408
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,550
Why shaved?

409
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,590
Sergei, don't go to these magazines.

410
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,800
What?

411
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:19,590
-Just never mind them.
-Dad...

412
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,130
Think about writing a history novel.

413
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,920
Maybe you'll find more sense
in great fates.

414
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:28,920
Dad.

415
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,590
Fine.

416
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,340
-Sleep.
-I need to go.

417
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,550
Why great fates?

418
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,050
Still, don't go there.

419
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,460
Joseph, where can I get a big doll?

420
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,250
Nobody expects it.

421
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,500
Go back to sleep, sweetheart.

422
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,210
NOVEMBER 2

423
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,380
The man who was playing
Pushkin lost his frock

424
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,090
when he got drunk by the end of the shoot.

425
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,840
-Yes, absolutely.
-Right?

426
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:41,800
Natasha Rostova, quite tipsy,
took a cab home to Kapina Street.

427
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,880
She invited everybody over.

428
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,630
Gogol wanted to go, but he had
to get his grandson to kindergarten,

429
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,460
and his wife is at the HR.

430
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,750
What a pathetic finale
for Russian literature.

431
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,300
-There used to be women, passion...
-It's not funny.

432
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,960
-I like writing about labor.
-Good for you.

433
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,340
-Hello.
-Hi.

434
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,550
Sergei, stop turning everything into
a circus. It's a factory newspaper.

435
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,250
Let's go to the editor.

436
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,550
No. A deep analytical article
about spirituality.

437
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,000
A few terse lines.

438
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,000
-What spirituality?
-Full of grandeur.

439
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,170
-It feels like we work at <i>The Times</i>.
-What <i>Times</i>?

440
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,710
The whole world knows it,
and I've never even seen an issue.

441
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,000
-Hi.
-Hello, comrades.

442
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,130
Sergei. Do you want to say something?

443
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,670
You ignore me.

444
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:31,800
I thought we would go to my father's dacha
and then to Bulgaria, to the Golden Sands.

445
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,880
It's a fantastic place.

446
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,170
Why don't you say something?

447
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,960
-Hello.
-Hello.

448
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,880
So, it was a joke, and you love your wife.

449
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,840
I thought you were in love with me.

450
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:57,340
What would I do in Bulgaria? Why?

451
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,960
Aren't you ashamed?

452
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,550
Sergei. Come here.

453
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,300
Please talk to him nicely.

454
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,920
If he tells you
to rewrite the article, do it.

455
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,300
-Of course.
-Good.

456
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:31,210
-Hello.
-Dovlatov.

457
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,960
Why are you looking at me like this?
Don't you see me?

458
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,750
Why are you always so sarcastic?

459
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,960
Stop being a decadent.

460
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,840
You need to rewrite the article
about the shooting.

461
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,800
What was so funny about them?
What's funny about Gogol, Pushkin?

462
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,630
They had suffered enough
at the hands of the bourgeoisie.

463
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,050
I read your manuscripts.

464
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:01,050
There are interesting details,
but the hero...

465
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,880
No clear goal,
on his way to moral failure.

466
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,250
You need to write real literature,
about sports, heroic deeds.

467
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:16,340
You have no hero.
You need a hero and an anti-hero.

468
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,550
It's the first law of dramaturgy.

469
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,710
People want to see the struggle...

470
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,550
for socialistic ideals.

471
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,420
-Sergei, look.
-Where is your hero?

472
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,050
I believe our society consists of heroes.
Every schoolboy is a future Hercules.

473
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,500
What if a hero has just come to watch?

474
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:37,130
He's standing aside, pondering,
living his own life, small as it is.

475
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,710
In our time, the very existence of thought
is heroism in itself.

476
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,000
Sergei, we need a hero.

477
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,250
If you don't rewrite the article,
we won't pay you.

478
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,630
What is this Brodsky poem about?

479
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,500
It doesn't matter.

480
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,750
It's impressionism, the essence of poetry.

481
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,920
This isn't that bad, but it's affected.

482
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:12,960
There's no educational value.
Who is it meant for?

483
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:16,130
"Is this a dreamy mirage?"
What is he hinting at?

484
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:20,170
We'd better ask Yevtushenko.
Or Antokolsky, Alekseyev.

485
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,420
-It's not for a magazine.
-I agree.

486
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,050
Why not Brodsky?

487
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,710
It's good for the magazine.

488
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,710
I hate rejecting Brodsky.

489
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,920
I told him he needed to take
an active social stand.

490
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,920
He didn't want to.

491
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,840
All right, this is it for today.

492
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,130
-Hi.
-Hello.

493
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:51,090
What censorship? We don't have censorship.
Good morning.

494
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,590
It's a wonderful poem.

495
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,590
<i>Soviet literature journals had a rule:</i>
<i>lack of talent is unprofitable,</i>

496
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:02,630
<i>a talent is alarming,</i>
<i>a genius incites fear.</i>

497
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,460
<i>Mediocre literary abilities</i>
<i>were the most marketable.</i>

498
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,420
-Hello.
-Hello.

499
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,000
-Hello.
-Hello.

500
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:18,460
Do you remember me? I'm Dovlatov.
I sent you my manuscript.

501
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:19,750
Have you read it?

502
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,300
I write fiction, too. I gave it to you
many times, but you won't publish it,

503
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,920
and the Writers' Union won't
admit me without publications.

504
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,750
You've rejected me many times.

505
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:37,000
I remember your friends
advertising American painter Pollack

506
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,500
at the literary readings.

507
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,920
There was also a letter
to the Central Committee about you

508
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,630
reading something with a Jewish theme.

509
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,800
That was silly.
I think you've made a mistake.

510
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,960
Why Jewish theme?
There were other nations, too.

511
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:54,840
We wrote about ordinary people.

512
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,130
There wasn't even any excessive eroticism.

513
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,920
-So, have you read my manuscript?
-Excuse me.

514
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:04,750
Why are we giving unpublished manuscripts
to schoolchildren who collect waste paper?

515
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:16,340
"The ship was sailing in the fog.

516
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:21,090
Absurd to think that the ship
goes to land, if at all it was a ship."

517
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:25,300
What is it? Is it a good poem?

518
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,750
Brodsky is a genius, and we aren't.
That's the way it is.

519
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:33,420
Do you realize
you can never get published?

520
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,920
What can I do?

521
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,630
Well... let's try.

522
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,250
We urgently need an interview
with a worker who is also a poet.

523
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:48,380
-Hello.
-Kuznetsov.

524
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,170
He works at the underground construction.
A simple man.

525
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:56,670
If you finish it by Friday,
we'll try to publish your story.

526
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,880
We also need a poem
about oilfield workers.

527
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,550
Excuse me. Sign this, please.

528
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,880
A sincere, non-affected one.

529
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:13,340
Write a talented, life-asserting poem.

530
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,380
Maybe we'll publish your fiction, too.

531
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,800
But without any double meaning.
Something bright.

532
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:24,920
-Thank you. Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

533
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,090
-Hi, Sergei.
-Good luck.

534
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,090
-Serge.
-Hi.

535
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,090
How did it go?

536
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,590
I don't know.

537
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,340
She wants me to write some crap.

538
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,800
Some nonsense.

539
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:46,130
-An incredible force.
-OK, see you.

540
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:49,000
-Hello.
-Hi.

541
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,420
Come on.

542
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,550
I brought you my novelette, remember?
Did you like it?

543
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,590
Don't worry. It's good. I read it.

544
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,050
I don't think Pushkin can do it.

545
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,300
We've removed one author.

546
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,710
-Hello.
-Hi.

547
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,630
-And the Strugatskys...
-Hello.

548
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,000
It's lightweight, right?

549
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:27,590
Sergei... This is a shame. I'm sorry.

550
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,960
So do something.

551
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,880
Look at this truth seeker!

552
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,630
Lightweight! Shit.

553
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,380
Can you believe it?

554
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:52,500
They gave up all the unpublished
manuscripts as waste paper.

555
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,000
It's people's lives.

556
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,590
I couldn't stop them in time.

557
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,050
Are they going to publish Brodsky?

558
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,090
They disassembled the type
at the last moment.

559
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,460
I am small-fry.

560
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,920
No, you are not small.

561
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,090
Have you seen <i>King Kong</i>?

562
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,500
You are amazing, Sergei. It's just...

563
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,500
Excuse me... Were there some of mine?

564
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:29,380
Sergei, you're a very good writer.
You are.

565
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,380
Excuse me.

566
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:47,590
You know, on the 3rd, there will be
a party at my father's friend's dacha.

567
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:52,300
You should come. If he wants to,
he'll get you admitted to the Union.

568
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,800
Make him like you.

569
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,800
Bring cognac. He likes French cognac.

570
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,380
Where would I get it?

571
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,000
-Hello.
-Hello.

572
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,750
The review is a disaster.

573
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,590
How much longer?

574
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,800
Don't whine. Talent and success
are perpendicular to each other.

575
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,170
Zhenia.

576
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,000
Joseph.

577
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,460
Hello, my friends.

578
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,590
Me...

579
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:05,050
Can you help the kids carry
the waste paper to the school?

580
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,130
They are tired, and there's a lot left.

581
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,090
You're so big, but you have no pity.
It's cold.

582
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,340
There's a lot of waste here.

583
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,090
Will you help?

584
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,210
Come on. Let's walk.

585
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,670
Do you have Remarque, <i>Three Comrades?</i>

586
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,920
Next to me.

587
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,170
-Do you have <i>Three Comrades?</i>
-No. Check this.

588
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,050
-Will you take this?
-No.

589
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,590
Hello.

590
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,840
-Do you have Steinbeck?
-I don't know. We'll see.

591
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,630
Hello. Do you have Steinbeck?

592
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,500
Are you looking for foreign books?

593
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,380
I have Nabokov,

594
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,590
a novel about an affair with
an American young pioneer.

595
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,750
It's indecent but interesting.
It was banned. It's called <i>Lolita.</i>

596
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,960
Do you want it?

597
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,380
We also had Solzhenitsyn,
but we're out of stock.

598
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,710
Are you new? I haven't seen you before.

599
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,250
So, how about Nabokov?

600
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,670
Call me Comrade Captain. Are you drunk?

601
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,420
-Excuse me?
-It's Comrade Captain to you.

602
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,380
-Me?
-Yes.

603
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,130
-I never...
-What?

604
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:28,500
-I...
-You were drinking.

605
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:33,170
-No!
-I'll file a report on you.

606
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,460
What?

607
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:38,960
I haven't read Nabokov, but I write down
everyone who asks about it.

608
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:42,550
I make lists and report to Frolov.

609
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,090
-Who?
-Frolov.

610
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,500
Frolov was sent to Africa
to protect the working people.

611
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,880
All right. Prepare the list by the morning
of November 5 and pass it to me.

612
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,210
-Got it?
-Yes.

613
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,340
-Did you get it?
-Yes.

614
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,250
-Give me a cigarette.
-Yes.

615
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,960
-Were there any Zionists?
-No.

616
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,380
-Humanists?
-No.

617
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,000
-Is Golda Meir a hawk?
-No. I mean, yes.

618
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:02,960
-Yes?
-Yes.

619
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:03,920
Good.

620
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,090
-What's so funny?
-But...

621
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:10,420
What? What is so funny? Sodomites? No?

622
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,710
-No.
-No? Go.

623
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,880
-Got it?
-Yes.

624
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,300
-Got it?
-Yes, Comrade Captain.

625
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,050
-Got it.
-Quick.

626
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,500
<i>These are my friends.</i>

627
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:34,550
<i>Artists, scallywags,</i>
<i>drunks, which is a plus,</i>

628
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,090
<i>and sometimes talented people.</i>

629
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,630
<i>The one wearing a cap is David.</i>
<i>He is a huckster.</i>

630
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:41,300
<i>Sells imported clothes,</i>
<i>discs, and magazines.</i>

631
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,880
<i>He's a close friend.</i>

632
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,800
-Who needs them?
-There are as good as our avant-garde.

633
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,090
Yes, sure.

634
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:49,090
No worse than Malevich and Kandinsky.

635
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,670
I can give you an album.

636
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,000
For triple the price? You'll go bankrupt.

637
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,800
-No, for free.
-David, for free?

638
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,420
I can lend it for three days.

639
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,210
No, thanks.

640
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,840
They should look through our albums,
not vice versa.

641
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:07,670
You betray avant-garde art,
making money off your friends.

642
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,800
I am avant-garde.

643
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:11,250
-Do you have brushes?
-No, I don't.

644
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:14,670
Don't take the pie from him.
The meat is overcooked.

645
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:17,130
-Where can I get French cognac?
-No. Hi.

646
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,550
-Do you have French cognac?
-No. I don't know.

647
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:24,420
The artists are OK. It's just our life.

648
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:25,960
No? Fine.

649
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,380
-Hi.
-Sergei.

650
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,250
-What is your shoe size?
-I don't know.

651
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,340
Is it 47?

652
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:44,670
What are you looking for?

653
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:49,210
-A washing machine. Viatka.
-I'm looking for Viatka, too.

654
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,340
The waiting list takes years.
I'm still waiting.

655
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,210
I haven't washed any laundry since 1969.

656
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,550
-This year's cognac is sweet. Why?
-It is.

657
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:02,840
-Are you from Yerevan?
-Yes.

658
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,710
I'm half-Armenian, half-Jewish.

659
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,920
Are you? What is your job?

660
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I don't know.

661
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:14,300
Losing my mind.

662
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:19,960
Irony is good.
I'm studying to be a psychologist.

663
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:26,420
A friend of mine believes irony
to be a descending metaphor.

664
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:28,840
What is a descending metaphor?

665
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,590
Listen. "Her eyes are like turquoise"
is an ascending metaphor.

666
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:36,550
"Her eyes are like brakes" –
a descending one.

667
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:39,840
-My name is Arevik.
-I'm Sergei.

668
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:44,250
You must love Hemingway. Do you?

669
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:49,960
I do. He had no time to get to love me.
Got drunk and shot himself. Good for him.

670
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:56,380
One after another. Let's finish it.
There's one gulp left.

671
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,250
Let's jack a glider and fly away.

672
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:15,840
I'm doing some stupid things...

673
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,880
and dream about paintings
I wanted to paint and couldn't.

674
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,550
I'm a fool, right?

675
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:23,590
I could be better than Pollack.

676
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,960
I will be.

677
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I want to be.

678
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:32,840
Otherwise, what's the point?

679
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:37,170
I decided to leave. Here, it's...

680
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:43,460
The songs, the talks...
You're nobody here, and neither am I.

681
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,880
Will it be better there?

682
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,300
Maybe it will.

683
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,300
No. You're lying to yourself.

684
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:54,590
Come on.

685
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:59,880
-On a glider.
-You're lying to yourself.

686
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:00,880
To a new life.

687
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,170
-What a nice day, right?
-Yes.

688
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:19,880
Shall we dance? Come on.

689
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,550
It's snowing again.

690
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:18,670
NOVEMBER 3

691
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,210
Now it's winter, and now it's fall.

692
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:27,550
Did you know that the Slavs called oil
"<i>ropa</i>," the Chinese – "<i>iginol</i>,"

693
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:32,750
and the Greeks and the Romans –
"petroleum"? <i>Iginol</i> sounds beautiful.

694
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:41,000
"I was looking at <i>iginol</i> without blinking.
Petroleum is mine, and <i>ropa</i>..."

695
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,340
It sounds a bit dirty.

696
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:49,300
Do you ever do bad things on purpose?

697
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:57,050
Baby, nobody can tell you that
but yourself.

698
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
No, I don't know.

699
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,550
Hi. Give me a smoke.

700
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:30,880
This metro line isn't deep.

701
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,750
Soon a whole new city will be next to it.

702
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:37,710
I'll pay you back on Wednesday.
I'll borrow from my mother-in-law.

703
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,050
Please give me two days.

704
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:40,840
This is Kuznetsov.

705
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,000
Kuznetsov!

706
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,420
A man... from the magazine.

707
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,750
-Hello.
-Hello.

708
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:53,750
Hey. I'm from the magazine,
about the interview.

709
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,250
-What's your name?
-I came to talk to you. Sergei.

710
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:03,750
Just tell me about your work,
about yourself, why you write poetry.

711
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,630
I have nothing to say, Sergei. Sorry.

712
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:09,050
It's ridiculous, you know.

713
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,130
They used to publish me:
<i>Severny Rabochy, Vyborgskaya Pravda.</i>

714
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:19,800
Even French socialists came to see
a man writing poetry underground.

715
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:22,590
They brought me cognac,
which I don't drink.

716
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:26,250
They were asking about poetry,
but I don't write it anymore.

717
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,500
My muse left me. So...

718
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:30,880
-Your muse?
-Yes.

719
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,050
It happens.

720
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:36,420
I have trouble with mine, too.

721
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Sometimes she's rude to me
and humiliates me.

722
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:42,550
Why do I have to tell you something?

723
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:48,630
Why do I have to tell you something?

724
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:50,840
I need to do this interview.

725
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,300
I can't go back up without it.

726
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:56,300
All right.

727
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:01,380
We met in the fall.
She said her name was Liuba.

728
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:07,800
When I saw her... my heart sank.

729
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,130
I went to buy her a fur coat,
and then I thought...

730
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:14,840
why buy love?

731
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,460
It's shameful.

732
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:22,090
Then, at the bunkhouse,
I heard this sound...

733
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:24,300
Thump, thump, thump.

734
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,630
I came in, and it was Tolik and Liuba.

735
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:31,170
He was spanking her, and she liked it.

736
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:34,920
I thought she was different.

737
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,170
I broke Tolik's nose.

738
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,840
Why?

739
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:47,590
I saw in her something more
than there actually was.

740
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:50,590
So...

741
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,090
Did you try to spank her?

742
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:56,500
What?

743
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,420
I'm sorry, but some people like it.

744
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:00,500
I'll hit you.

745
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:04,630
I'm sorry.

746
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,380
I wasn't trying to hurt you. Forgive me.

747
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,340
I can't forget about her.

748
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:16,750
I wanted to marry her,
spend all my life with her.

749
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,460
I wrote a poem. The newspaper rejected it.

750
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:23,000
"Too much God." So what?

751
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,050
It's actually good.

752
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,590
Why don't they publish me?

753
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:35,840
Why do I write?

754
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:44,000
There's no reason. That's why it matters.

755
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,250
Listen...

756
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,340
Can I borrow your French cognac?

757
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:56,550
What happened?

758
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:11,050
The toys are left...

759
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:16,840
These little hands...

760
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:28,590
Come on, come on.

761
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:31,590
The front line wasn't far from here.
The Nazis dropped a bomb.

762
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:33,460
The kids were hiding here.

763
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:35,340
They were all killed at once.

764
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:37,670
In France and Italy,
they find in the tunnels

765
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:39,550
underground churches with columns.

766
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:42,300
Here, we have only ground
and bodies in it.

767
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:46,590
Twenty-seven...

768
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,170
What a horrible day.

769
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:56,130
-Twenty-eight.
-Nina Petrovna.

770
00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:01,710
Twenty-nine. A whole school class.

771
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,000
No, they were too young.
Five, six years old.

772
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:08,630
A reception class.

773
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:12,500
Thirty.

774
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,630
Thirty-one.

775
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:22,460
Thirty-two.

776
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:31,880
They would be 30 now.

777
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:36,460
It has been 25 years since the war ended.

778
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:38,880
Twenty-five years.

779
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,630
Twenty-five years have passed.

780
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:54,170
Nina Petrovna, come with me. Let's go.

781
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:08,050
Thirty-four, 35.

782
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:22,710
<i>Later, Kuznetsov and I</i>
<i>went to some boss's dacha.</i>

783
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,420
<i>He was supposed to help me</i>

784
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,210
<i>join the Soviet Writers' Union</i>
<i>and get published.</i>

785
00:53:28,090 --> 00:53:32,960
<i>There was a variety of Party officials</i>
<i>there, both mature ones and beginners,</i>

786
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:35,090
<i>with their wives, girlfriends, and kids.</i>

787
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:52,130
They promised someone
from the City Council would come.

788
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:59,500
Sergei, meet my friend, a writer
from Finland, a friend of our country.

789
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:00,960
-This is Dovlatov.
-Sergei.

790
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:05,130
A young journalist. I suggested
that he wrote about something good.

791
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,000
He doesn't want to.

792
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,250
He speaks Finnish, by the way.

793
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:12,090
Do you like Finland? Have you been there?

794
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:13,130
I haven't.

795
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:16,000
Have you read my book about Remarque?

796
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,670
An interview with him.

797
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:19,920
I was on vacation in Paris with him.

798
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:21,840
Have you been to Paris?

799
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:22,920
I haven't.

800
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:26,000
-Do they sell piña colada in your country?
-What?

801
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:28,050
Piña colada. I often have dreams about it.

802
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:31,630
Do you have kimbi fruits?

803
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:35,750
You mixed it up. It's called kiwi.

804
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,800
Kimbi sounds beautiful,
like a small animal from childhood.

805
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,340
Kiwi sounds too trivial. Hi.

806
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:43,630
Hello.

807
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:45,460
Trivial. Thank you.

808
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:47,460
It was nice to meet you.

809
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:49,340
Kiwi!

810
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:52,880
Kiwi, kiwi.

811
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:55,880
What Paris, for God's sake?

812
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,170
What Finland?

813
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,090
Why did we come here?

814
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:14,380
Hey. Just came.

815
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,710
Marry me.

816
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:16,800
Hello.

817
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:22,170
-See you soon.
-"The frost..."

818
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:26,300
-"The frost is singing--"
-I know you.

819
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:28,840
You were at the conference in Yalta.

820
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:34,050
Excuse me.

821
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:38,000
-What did he want?
-Listen.

822
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:42,250
"The frost is singing,
hasn't lost his voice yet.

823
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:45,880
The snowstorm's words are white still.

824
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:52,340
It looks so beautiful
when sky is talking to the earth."

825
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:54,630
-Is it good?
-Yes.

826
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:01,630
My dog is sick...

827
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:07,420
"About something secret and alive,
about the friendly universe...

828
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:12,500
where you are born inside yourself
in a sincere conversation.

829
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:18,920
Without pretty clothes and decorations,
prepared for the new journey...

830
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:25,000
you look at the burning logs
at this serene hour."

831
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:28,130
-Is it good?
-Yes.

832
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:30,880
-You really like it?
-Yes.

833
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:34,050
Thank you.

834
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:36,420
Thank you.

835
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:47,090
He's finally free.
He's the host, after all.

836
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:48,920
-So many guests.
-So many guests.

837
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:56,210
I prepared a preamble...
I should have come earlier and with a bow.

838
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:58,090
I haven't bought a bow.
I didn't have money.

839
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,630
Semion Aleksandrovich. Don't forget.

840
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,710
He's not all wooden.
He knows everybody in the city.

841
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:09,090
He wants... He wants a bit of freedom.
Try to make friends with him.

842
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:11,550
He will help you. You'll get published.

843
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,130
Semion Aleksandrovich. Sergei Dovlatov.

844
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:22,630
Nice to meet you. Semion.

845
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:29,420
Semion Aleksandrovich likes poetry,
contemporary literature, art in general.

846
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,590
I love his poetry since 1965.

847
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:34,880
Will you excuse me?

848
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:57,050
It's Sholokhov and I.
He gave me his autograph.

849
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,880
He's a great writer.

850
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:04,460
He spoke well of my poetry collection.

851
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,800
I'm not too keen on Sholokhov.

852
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,710
He likes it when young authors go to jail.

853
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:14,710
-What do you want?
-I want to join the Writers' Union.

854
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:16,920
I need it for publications.

855
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:20,750
I send my stories
to every literary journal,

856
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:23,380
and I've been rejected a hundred times.

857
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:30,000
I don't know why they don't publish me.
Maybe because I'm a Jew.

858
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:53,710
Why the barracks?

859
00:58:58,130 --> 00:58:59,210
Why the camp?

860
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:31,500
I understand now.

861
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:36,880
You are gifted,
but obviously don't know much about life.

862
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:38,630
You write about some trifles.

863
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:41,960
To help someone, you need to believe
in them. This isn't for me.

864
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:46,050
Literature needs to be...

865
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:50,750
What can I do?

866
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:53,130
I don't know.

867
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:55,590
Just don't give up.

868
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:06,000
A writer needs to talk about huge,
supertemporal things.

869
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:15,340
Maybe we could write an epos together.
A Greek epos.

870
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:16,920
And then translate it into Latin.

871
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,340
It's different and--

872
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:23,050
-Take the cognac.
-No, thanks.

873
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:26,500
-Take it. It's good.
-I have a crate already.

874
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:33,000
Don't worry, Sergei. Come to my office.

875
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:34,670
Your office?

876
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,590
I'll examine your prostate.

877
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:42,420
Why prostate?

878
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:46,170
Is it for the Writers' Union?

879
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:47,420
A new procedure?

880
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:50,210
How about other unions?

881
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:52,920
The Composers'?

882
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:55,090
The Cinematographers'?

883
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,460
I'm the head of the urology department.
Didn't you know?

884
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:01,090
I just know people.

885
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,670
I like literature, classical studies.

886
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:08,090
Thank you.
My prostate will think about it.

887
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:13,500
The opening lines were...

888
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:19,630
Yevtushenko is a good poet.
He has a way to go, though.

889
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,050
It's actually good.

890
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:26,920
Let's drink to Yesenin, Blok,
Gumilyov, Pushkin, Lermontov...

891
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
No clinking.

892
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:33,250
-They all ended bad.
-So what?

893
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:37,800
-Kharms, Vvedensky...
-Vvedensky was killed.

894
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:40,420
I like poetry.

895
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,550
-What poetry?
-This cognac smells like a farm.

896
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:43,880
"And Schubert on the water...

897
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,380
and Mozart in the bird's hubbub,

898
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,210
and Goethe whistling
on his twisting path..."

899
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:50,460
I forgot.

900
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:55,090
"...the friendly universe,
where you are born inside yourself...

901
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,670
in a sincere conversation.
Without pretty clothes..."

902
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:02,840
-Anton, this is Sholom.
-Hello. Kuznetsov.

903
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,840
Anton is a very good poet.

904
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:06,550
Hello, Sholom.

905
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:13,130
Sholom is a wonderful painter,
but his works aren't on display.

906
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:15,500
This is Kari.

907
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:17,210
Right, Kari?

908
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:19,670
He is from Finland.

909
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,590
They brought him here
to show him how our people live.

910
01:02:23,090 --> 01:02:24,800
He met with Remarque in Paris...

911
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:27,210
where we will never be.

912
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:29,670
Boll is better than Remarque.

913
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:34,050
Fallada, Günter Grass.

914
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:36,380
You can't get their books here.
I haven't read them.

915
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,000
Tell me about Paris.

916
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:42,000
Have you been to Moulin Rouge?

917
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,050
Moulin Rouge is vulgar.

918
01:02:47,090 --> 01:02:48,800
I'll never go to Paris.

919
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:51,050
I'll die without seeing it.

920
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:52,630
Why don't you exhibit your works?

921
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:56,050
They say it's rubbish.

922
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,500
People used to mock the impressionists.

923
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:01,880
They are erasing us.

924
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:04,130
"The frost hasn't lost his voice yet."

925
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:06,300
Is Günter Grass a good writer?

926
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:11,000
They are erasing us.

927
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:30,050
Enough! Stop it. The neighbors are asleep.

928
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:31,550
Enough.

929
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,050
Go home.

930
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:35,420
You need to go to work early tomorrow.

931
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:39,920
You, stop it!
I'll show you how to play. Go home.

932
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:44,590
You believe that they are writers?
They aren't. They are riffraff.

933
01:03:56,090 --> 01:03:57,380
Are you writer Dovlatov?

934
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,710
The General Secretary is waiting for you.

935
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:02,880
It's windy today.

936
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:04,710
Hello.

937
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,920
-Is she your daughter?
-I am.

938
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:13,880
Come on.

939
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:16,130
Hello.

940
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:17,340
Oh, Dovlatov.

941
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:21,460
Do you think we need
to send our troops to Pakistan?

942
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,710
-I don't think so. What for?
-What is Pakistan?

943
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:27,340
They won't publish my works,
Comrade Brezhnev.

944
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:29,340
Local bureaucracy.

945
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:34,710
-So you think South America?
-It would be more lucrative.

946
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,710
Everybody drinks piña colada there.
Hemingway used to live there...

947
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:41,000
on some island.
I'm not sure which, Leonid Ilyich.

948
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:56,300
I've read the first volume of your novel.

949
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:59,090
It wasn't that good,
but I made some corrections,

950
01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:00,500
and now it's more artistic.

951
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:04,710
What do you think about Mao?

952
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:07,300
Should I invite him for a visit?

953
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:12,500
Would you like to write a book with me?

954
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:14,420
Billions would read it.

955
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:18,710
Is this your daughter?

956
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:20,340
Yes.

957
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,710
Your daddy and I
will write a book together.

958
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:24,710
What do you think?

959
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:27,920
Say something.

960
01:05:31,050 --> 01:05:32,300
Katia, tell us what you think.

961
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:35,670
Come on.

962
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:37,500
Katia.

963
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:41,590
-Tell us what you think.
-What do you think?

964
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:42,550
Katia.

965
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:46,210
-Don't be scared.
-What do you think?

966
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:48,000
Katia.

967
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,210
Tell us what you think.

968
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:54,500
What do you think?

969
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:57,800
Tell me what you think.

970
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:18,670
NOVEMBER 4

971
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:20,960
<i>This morning,</i>
<i>Leningrad was awakened by marches.</i>

972
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:22,380
<i>The holidays are coming.</i>

973
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:25,840
<i>People are already celebrating,</i>
<i>watching the foreigners suspiciously.</i>

974
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:40,800
We didn't even have snow.

975
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:43,840
It came only in December.

976
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:47,000
Sometimes it starts in September.

977
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:04,380
TO LIVE, TO STUDY, TO FIGHT,
AS WAS THE WILL OF THE GREAT LENIN

978
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:18,920
Could you lend me 25 rubles?

979
01:07:19,170 --> 01:07:21,880
Do you know
where I could buy a German doll?

980
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:23,670
A big one.

981
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:31,130
Nothing. I'm sorry.
You keep in touch, too. Sorry. Thanks.

982
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:51,960
Who are you? Hands off her!

983
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:54,340
-Zverev, Pavel. You?
-Katia, do you know him?

984
01:07:56,130 --> 01:07:57,630
-I'm Katia's dad.
-Shame on you.

985
01:07:57,710 --> 01:08:00,920
I'm Lena's colleague, a PhD.
I speak seven languages.

986
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:02,960
I'm also a boxing pro.

987
01:08:03,050 --> 01:08:05,460
Don't make me beat you
in front of your daughter.

988
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:06,500
Get to me first.

989
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:07,710
Stop it.

990
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:10,550
-Hi.
-He's my colleague,

991
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:12,630
a decent man, and nothing more.

992
01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:14,210
-He's a PhD.
-Outrageous.

993
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:16,460
Don't be ridiculous.
You should be ashamed.

994
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:20,460
What do you need him for?
Seven languages! What for?

995
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:23,250
I would have understood
if he were talented.

996
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:26,630
I befriend whom I want.
I work from dawn to dusk. Cut this drama.

997
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:27,880
There's no drama.

998
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:30,460
A divorce doesn't mean I should suffer.

999
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,800
-Katia, let's go.
-Daddy, give me back.

1000
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:40,880
Don't suffer, then...

1001
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:42,840
you selfish man.

1002
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:45,090
Did you know Katia had a sinus infection?

1003
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:50,670
I've typed your manuscripts.
Come get them later.

1004
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:58,500
It's my business if I suffer or not.
Don't you dare call me selfish.

1005
01:08:59,130 --> 01:09:00,170
I forbid you, Lena.

1006
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:03,090
Sergei.

1007
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:47,750
-Sergei.
-Hi.

1008
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:51,960
Hi, Sergei. They didn't get me reinstated
at the Arts Academy.

1009
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,250
You know Zharkikh's and Arefiev's work?

1010
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,340
Our young artists are great.

1011
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:01,880
Better than Pollack.

1012
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:05,340
Too bad they'll be devoured.

1013
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:10,090
Hi. Have you seen Bob from Kiev?

1014
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:12,210
-No.
-Sorry. I thought you were someone else.

1015
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,710
-Say hi to Bob.
-Say hi to Bob.

1016
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:23,670
Bosses devour everyone.
They did it in the Tsar's time...

1017
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:25,550
and they still do.

1018
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:26,800
Never mind them.

1019
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:30,880
I had a bad fight with Lena again.

1020
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:36,960
Could you lend me 25 rubles?

1021
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:38,960
I want to buy a doll for Katia.

1022
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:43,880
I can't, but you can earn it.
I need you to meet with a Finn.

1023
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:49,460
He'll bring pantyhose, discs, and clothes.

1024
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:52,920
You'll meet him
and bring them to the studio.

1025
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:56,460
You'll get the money the day after.
I'd do it myself,

1026
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,300
but the police know my face.

1027
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:00,460
I'd get caught.

1028
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,750
-Can you do it?
-Yes.

1029
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:15,250
This is the address.

1030
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:18,800
There will be this weird girl
wearing a beret.

1031
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:19,880
She's always smiling.

1032
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,130
Did I show you my Rothko album?

1033
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:27,380
He's interesting. I didn't know about him.

1034
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:30,380
I traded the album for caviar.

1035
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:40,590
Hello. Hello, comrades, foreigners.

1036
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:44,960
I wonder if you have piña colada.

1037
01:11:45,670 --> 01:11:48,050
Hello. A cap... Are you a spy?

1038
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,050
Do you like Leningrad?

1039
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:02,210
Yes.

1040
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:05,960
A nice city. It's dark, though.

1041
01:12:20,710 --> 01:12:22,460
It's an old car. The engine is rattling.

1042
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,300
How long have you been doing this?
Aren't you afraid?

1043
01:12:30,170 --> 01:12:32,800
Are you Dovlatov? I know your brother.

1044
01:12:33,710 --> 01:12:34,960
He used to be a huckster, too.

1045
01:12:35,710 --> 01:12:36,880
We were in jail together.

1046
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:38,960
He saved my life there.

1047
01:12:40,550 --> 01:12:42,300
In another life, he would be a Rothschild.

1048
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,630
A Captain Frolov caught him.

1049
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:49,710
-He told me you were a writer.
-I don't know. I'm trying to be.

1050
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:54,340
Your brother is a good guy.
You look a lot like him.

1051
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,840
Too bad you two won't die of old age.

1052
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,170
I can see such things.

1053
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,090
Keep writing while you still can.

1054
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:06,300
Leave something behind.

1055
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:08,880
This is stupid and vulgar.
This is macabre.

1056
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:23,800
Sergei. Did you notice he had lost weight?

1057
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:27,130
All these monuments to party leaders
must have exhausted him.

1058
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,130
Why didn't you bring discs?
I asked for Pink Floyd.

1059
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:34,750
I also have jeans.

1060
01:13:39,130 --> 01:13:42,460
Do they sell big German dolls
with long hair in Finland?

1061
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,090
It's not like here.

1062
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:47,880
We have tons of dolls of any kind.

1063
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,420
Millions.

1064
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:51,880
We have everything.

1065
01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:06,380
Do you know contemporary Russian writers?
Solzhenitsyn, Yevtushenko?

1066
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:07,840
No.

1067
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:09,880
Did you hear about Mandelstam?

1068
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:12,670
-Never.
-We are like Mozart and Salieri.

1069
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:13,920
I, of course, am Mozart.

1070
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:15,630
-Are you Mozart?
-Yes.

1071
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:18,050
-And I'm Salieri?
-No, you're Mozart.

1072
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:20,340
Excuse me. I know Chekhov.

1073
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:23,460
-Me, too.
-There can't be two Mozarts.

1074
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:24,420
One, then.

1075
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:28,250
-Listen. Are these paintings yours?
-Yes.

1076
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:30,340
You must be selling them.

1077
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,300
They are mine.

1078
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:40,670
Please give us the sum.

1079
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:42,800
Here are the goods.

1080
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:45,460
That's everything.

1081
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:00,750
Is this awful or not that bad?

1082
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:02,880
What is it?

1083
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,800
Want some <i>keşkül</i>?

1084
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:13,460
I'm Armenian. I don't like Turkish food.

1085
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:16,170
What if we ask your Jewish half?

1086
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:19,750
My Jewish half respects my Armenian part.

1087
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:21,500
Solidarity, you know.

1088
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:37,960
Sergei, you're a great person.

1089
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:40,500
A great talent.

1090
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:42,500
But this is bad.

1091
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:44,300
Very bad.

1092
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:45,920
Why do it?

1093
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,550
It will haunt you. You'll be ashamed.

1094
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,960
Don't lick their asses.
Why write this nonsense?

1095
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:00,000
This is for... for a magazine about oil.
For money.

1096
01:16:01,050 --> 01:16:04,340
I can see that.
But there are other ways to make money.

1097
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:07,420
Let's steal a car.

1098
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:10,090
It would be more honest.

1099
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:16,550
We'll make it.

1100
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:18,550
We'll get out of it.

1101
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:24,960
You'll publish your books.
I'll display my works.

1102
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:27,500
We'll be old and pathetic.

1103
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,750
We'll refer each other to our doctors.

1104
01:16:44,210 --> 01:16:47,300
I'll go get drunk.
It will be my alcoholic protestation.

1105
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:55,050
I'll chain myself to the bottle.

1106
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,710
Again? You're on a binge?

1107
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:08,250
-What's so funny?
-The opposite of pride.

1108
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:10,630
-Hi.
-Sergei.

1109
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:20,460
Don't get drunk.

1110
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:47,300
Hairy hooligans.

1111
01:17:58,380 --> 01:17:59,550
Welcome, Sergei Dovlatov!

1112
01:18:16,170 --> 01:18:17,300
Don't be shy.

1113
01:18:43,210 --> 01:18:46,130
-Nadia, don't be a drill sergeant.
-Come on, come on.

1114
01:18:50,380 --> 01:18:51,590
What can I do?

1115
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:04,500
If our young people
listen to our pop music...

1116
01:19:04,590 --> 01:19:06,050
NOVEMBER 5

1117
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:07,170
Come on, eat.

1118
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:09,420
The soup is really good.

1119
01:19:09,630 --> 01:19:11,710
...it won't give any result.

1120
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:15,130
Excuse me. May I?

1121
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:17,050
Yes.

1122
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:24,590
Boss...

1123
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:29,550
I brought you the Nabokov lists.
People who were interested.

1124
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,210
-Yes.
-<i>Lolita</i> is more dangerous than it seems.

1125
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:35,800
-I think it incites--
-I told you not to drink.

1126
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:37,750
-I'm not drunk.
-You're drunk again.

1127
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,800
-No. I swear.
-You're drunk right now.

1128
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:41,130
You are.

1129
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:44,710
Here are those who asked about <i>Lolita</i>.

1130
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:45,800
Come on, breathe.

1131
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:49,710
You are drunk. Good job. I'm proud of you.

1132
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:56,340
Can you help me get a washing machine?

1133
01:19:57,710 --> 01:19:58,960
Come to the office tomorrow

1134
01:19:59,050 --> 01:20:02,210
and ask for Captain Malevich.
He is in charge of domestic appliances.

1135
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:04,590
If he's busy, ask for Kandinsky. Got it?

1136
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,210
Got it. Thanks a lot.

1137
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:09,420
Could you help me with a motorbike?

1138
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:12,630
Are you out of your mind?

1139
01:20:15,130 --> 01:20:16,000
I...

1140
01:20:16,090 --> 01:20:17,210
-You're drunk.
-What?

1141
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:20,800
-Get out of here.
-OK. I get it. I understand.

1142
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:23,090
Thank you.

1143
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:29,090
-Remember Consuelo Torres?
-It's so sad.

1144
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:04,000
Sergei.

1145
01:21:04,210 --> 01:21:06,840
Sergei, it's the song of our youth.

1146
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:08,340
You can sing it at parties.

1147
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:17,380
"A bright star is shining in the sky,

1148
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:19,670
and the drilling site
is in uneasy slumber.

1149
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:21,840
The oil deposit is waiting for our hands,

1150
01:21:22,130 --> 01:21:24,170
and my country is waiting for oil.

1151
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:27,050
A sudden shadow and an underground noise,

1152
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:29,050
a flash of the exhausted mind.

1153
01:21:29,130 --> 01:21:30,590
I'm asking the world again:

1154
01:21:30,670 --> 01:21:33,210
'Why are we here? Why this derrick?'

1155
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:37,210
Of course it's here. How could it not be?

1156
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:38,590
It bears its energetic burden,

1157
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:40,590
so that all those forgotten by the time

1158
01:21:40,670 --> 01:21:43,340
could wash their hands in the black gold."

1159
01:21:43,420 --> 01:21:44,420
Are you crazy?

1160
01:21:45,170 --> 01:21:46,710
-Are you a fool?
-Are you?

1161
01:21:48,050 --> 01:21:49,300
-Hello.
-Why? What for?

1162
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:51,500
This is supposed to be a holiday greeting.

1163
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,090
I can't do it... sincerely...

1164
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,130
and seriously.

1165
01:21:57,670 --> 01:21:59,380
It came out funny.

1166
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,500
Sergei, she's very upset.

1167
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:03,670
Apologize.

1168
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:05,840
Tell her it was because of vodka.

1169
01:22:07,630 --> 01:22:09,300
She'll understand. Her son is a drunk.

1170
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:11,920
What does vodka have to do with it?

1171
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,500
You need to settle it somehow.

1172
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:19,920
I haven't done the interview.

1173
01:22:23,050 --> 01:22:24,710
-Hello.
-Hello. Come on in.

1174
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:25,670
Hello.

1175
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,250
What happened with Kuznetsov yesterday?

1176
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:32,420
Were you drinking together?
Was it something you said to him?

1177
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:37,460
Kuznetsov got into a fight yesterday.
He was arrested.

1178
01:22:38,210 --> 01:22:41,920
He broke the <i>Smena</i> editor's nose
over some poem about dead children.

1179
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,420
What dead children?

1180
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:48,130
A religious poem, at that.

1181
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:52,380
Do you realize your poem is very bad?

1182
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:54,420
Will you rewrite it?

1183
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:58,300
And then, a story...
a bright and positive one.

1184
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:01,550
I don't know how.

1185
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:05,710
I'll keep waking up, thinking,
"What a bad dream."

1186
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:08,630
But it won't be a dream.

1187
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:11,750
I don't know
how to write positive stories.

1188
01:23:12,170 --> 01:23:14,800
Literature can't be positive or negative.

1189
01:23:17,170 --> 01:23:18,800
It's either there or it isn't.

1190
01:23:20,130 --> 01:23:22,710
Thank you, but I don't know how.

1191
01:23:23,710 --> 01:23:26,460
I can write good fiction.

1192
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:28,380
I don't want to write bad poetry.

1193
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,210
You're right. Thank you.

1194
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:34,960
Is it a no? I don't understand.

1195
01:23:38,130 --> 01:23:40,250
I wouldn't say it's a no...

1196
01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:43,670
but it's not a yes.

1197
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:51,170
Well, if you don't want it...

1198
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:58,050
It's OK that you said no.

1199
01:23:59,630 --> 01:24:02,630
Have you seen The Scream by Munch?
Do you like it?

1200
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:04,880
Maybe he visited
the National Economy Exhibition.

1201
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:08,920
I don't understand this kind of art.
What is it about? Who is this Munch?

1202
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:14,420
It's a single-handed protest against
the power of the capital.

1203
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:17,210
Do you know our artist Ustiugov?

1204
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:18,920
He's very talented. A factory worker.

1205
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,750
Andrey wouldn't open his door.

1206
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,550
-Open up!
-Andrey, let us in!

1207
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:29,000
-Open up!
-Andrey, open the door!

1208
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:31,300
Andrey!

1209
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:34,840
What happened?

1210
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,840
-Andrey!
-What happened?

1211
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:41,420
Andrey!

1212
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:45,300
Why, Andrey? Why did you do it?

1213
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:47,210
Why? Andrey?

1214
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:48,420
Call the doctor.

1215
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:50,210
He's a good writer.

1216
01:24:51,050 --> 01:24:52,500
Why did you treat him like this?

1217
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:53,960
Why are you standing here?

1218
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:56,050
What are you waiting for?

1219
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
What are you waiting for? Do something!

1220
01:25:02,550 --> 01:25:04,050
-Call the ambulance.
-Come on!

1221
01:25:04,130 --> 01:25:05,750
-Call the ambulance!
-He's dying!

1222
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:08,050
-Call the ambulance!
-What are you waiting for?

1223
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:09,960
Do something!

1224
01:25:11,050 --> 01:25:12,420
-Easy.
-He's dying!

1225
01:25:12,710 --> 01:25:13,840
Let's lift him. Easy.

1226
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:15,170
Andrey!

1227
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:17,000
-Andrey!
-Careful.

1228
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:21,920
They wouldn't publish him.
So? He's not the only one.

1229
01:25:23,210 --> 01:25:24,130
Andrey...

1230
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:26,420
Easy, easy.

1231
01:25:40,130 --> 01:25:42,670
I think we need to float out this ship

1232
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:44,460
as soon as possible.

1233
01:25:45,630 --> 01:25:47,550
It was our collegial decision.

1234
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,920
Our factory workers

1235
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,210
decided to celebrate in this way
the anniversary of the October Revolution.

1236
01:25:56,550 --> 01:25:58,670
The management has supported us...

1237
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:02,300
and we do everything to make it in time.

1238
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:05,920
Our team is famous for its traditions.

1239
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:11,710
This can become another good one.

1240
01:26:13,170 --> 01:26:14,840
Besides, we are finishing our film.

1241
01:26:38,630 --> 01:26:42,090
We used to be friends with him...

1242
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:47,840
That's it...

1243
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:53,170
We need to draft a statute...

1244
01:27:08,670 --> 01:27:10,500
Sergei? Sergei.

1245
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:13,880
Hi.

1246
01:27:14,590 --> 01:27:15,460
Hi.

1247
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:17,920
-Do you have matches?
-No.

1248
01:27:18,090 --> 01:27:19,460
How long has it been?

1249
01:27:21,050 --> 01:27:22,130
Seven years?

1250
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:25,630
I've been working in Kazan.

1251
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:30,050
It's a magical place.
People are different there.

1252
01:27:30,130 --> 01:27:32,090
You promised to call me back,
but you never did.

1253
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:33,250
I'm sorry.

1254
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:44,960
OK, never mind. It's no big deal.
How is your book going?

1255
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:47,750
So-so.

1256
01:27:48,590 --> 01:27:49,960
I'm at a shoot here.

1257
01:27:51,550 --> 01:27:54,380
I'll have to go soon.
It's at another pavilion.

1258
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:55,630
Banionis is doing it...

1259
01:27:56,380 --> 01:27:57,420
I mean, he's in it.

1260
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:00,420
-The director is a foreigner.
-Whom do you play?

1261
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:06,050
Whom do I play? I...

1262
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:11,670
I don't have lines.
But it's a great director.

1263
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:14,670
How are you?

1264
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,000
Married? Divorced?

1265
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:23,090
Remember how we...

1266
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:26,670
broke into a museum
and spent all night running around?

1267
01:28:29,090 --> 01:28:30,670
I think about it almost every day.

1268
01:28:31,210 --> 01:28:33,300
Well, in fact, every day.

1269
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:36,170
So, how are you?

1270
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:39,960
They ordered me to write
some hideous poem, and I said no.

1271
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:42,300
Did you?

1272
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,090
I told the editor to go to hell.

1273
01:28:47,380 --> 01:28:48,300
Yes.

1274
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:51,050
I'm trying to write a novel,
but it doesn't work.

1275
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:56,550
Do they publish young authors in Kazan?

1276
01:28:58,210 --> 01:28:59,130
Do you know?

1277
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:00,420
I don't know.

1278
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:02,880
I don't think so.

1279
01:29:08,090 --> 01:29:10,050
You know how much courage it takes...

1280
01:29:11,170 --> 01:29:12,670
to be nobody and still be yourself?

1281
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:28,550
-Zina, hello.
-Hello.

1282
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,750
Write your hideous poem.

1283
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:39,750
Apologize to the editor.

1284
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:43,750
It won't be easy, but it will be right.

1285
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,000
Thanks.

1286
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:47,420
Thank you.

1287
01:30:00,170 --> 01:30:01,590
Stepan! Stiopa!

1288
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:03,840
Stepan!

1289
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:18,550
"You left without a word,
but my loving heart was my spy.

1290
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:23,630
Don't say our fate is harsh.
No precipice will part us."

1291
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:25,420
-Hello. Can I sit down?
-Good afternoon.

1292
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:29,000
"Sit down and listen. There will be evil.

1293
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:32,960
You'll lose your home,
your homeland and shelter."

1294
01:30:36,090 --> 01:30:37,420
We need to shorten it.

1295
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:42,500
Let Ring 5 work.

1296
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:46,750
I work until seven today.

1297
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,880
Goodbye.

1298
01:30:52,090 --> 01:30:54,210
I'm fitting this poem for a Polish film.

1299
01:30:56,460 --> 01:31:00,710
To lip-sync it,
sometimes you need longer words

1300
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:01,960
and sometimes shorter.

1301
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:03,920
How long does it take?

1302
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:06,550
The shift lasts six or seven hours.

1303
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:10,000
Sometimes we stay late.

1304
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:13,420
But it's a good job.

1305
01:31:16,130 --> 01:31:18,380
The sole tore off my shoe on my way home.

1306
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:20,750
I tripped.

1307
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:26,420
I used to think if I'd written
a novel I'd unite the whole world.

1308
01:31:28,250 --> 01:31:35,170
What if I wasn't meant for fighting
but for peeping into the time's keyhole?

1309
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:44,500
To see myself, the world around me,
people around me, not writing novels.

1310
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:49,090
Not stand on a rostrum, but just...

1311
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:53,420
Sometimes I just want to disappear.

1312
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:57,590
Now I'm here, now I'm not.

1313
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:02,880
Sergei, tea?

1314
01:32:03,710 --> 01:32:05,880
It's very good.
Help yourself. There's the teapot.

1315
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:15,250
Tea is good.
Everything will be fine somehow.

1316
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:17,960
They called me for a talk.

1317
01:32:20,670 --> 01:32:22,590
Threatened me with jail.

1318
01:32:30,130 --> 01:32:34,800
-OK. Back to work.
-May I?

1319
01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:38,130
Hello.

1320
01:32:46,670 --> 01:32:49,090
All right...

1321
01:32:51,250 --> 01:32:52,800
"I can't find strength to leave.

1322
01:32:53,050 --> 01:32:57,460
The beckoning spirit

1323
01:32:59,050 --> 01:33:00,710
of the black winds..."

1324
01:33:01,670 --> 01:33:02,710
What's so funny?

1325
01:33:08,090 --> 01:33:09,340
I told the editor to screw off.

1326
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:14,880
Screw off? Good job.

1327
01:33:19,090 --> 01:33:21,750
-Do you like the poem?
-It's good.

1328
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:25,460
More or less, yes. Because I wrote it.

1329
01:33:38,300 --> 01:33:40,500
It's a love triangle, see?

1330
01:33:44,130 --> 01:33:47,050
I was supposed to sell the jeans,
but the customers disappeared on me.

1331
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:50,920
Nobody buys the magazines, too.

1332
01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:55,420
I'm sorry, Sergei. I can't pay you today.

1333
01:33:57,130 --> 01:33:58,420
I can't sell anything.

1334
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:01,210
They won't pick up the phone.

1335
01:34:02,090 --> 01:34:03,050
I need it today.

1336
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,380
I was going to buy Katia a doll.

1337
01:34:07,340 --> 01:34:10,300
Wait a couple of days, OK?

1338
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:15,380
Is something wrong?

1339
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:17,340
No, I'm fine.

1340
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,380
What if I give you my painting?

1341
01:34:28,670 --> 01:34:30,550
In 20 years you'll sell it
and make good money.

1342
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:34,300
The impressionists
weren't recognized at once, either.

1343
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:40,090
Yes. People didn't understand them
and mocked them.

1344
01:34:43,170 --> 01:34:44,170
Are you leaving?

1345
01:34:50,670 --> 01:34:54,420
I've ordered already,
and now it appears I don't have money.

1346
01:34:54,630 --> 01:34:55,630
Time to bugger off.

1347
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:00,250
Hello. Happy holidays.

1348
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:04,000
Economic Security Department.
Can I talk to your friend?

1349
01:35:04,090 --> 01:35:05,840
-Turn off the music.
-Come here, please.

1350
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:07,340
Please come with us.

1351
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:10,130
Follow me, citizen.

1352
01:35:10,630 --> 01:35:14,420
Senior Detective Major Fedorchuk,
Economic Security.

1353
01:35:15,670 --> 01:35:17,050
David Lvovich Vinogradov?

1354
01:35:18,670 --> 01:35:20,500
You are suspected in abroachment,

1355
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:25,170
according to Article 154 of the Criminal
Code of USSR. Please come with us.

1356
01:35:25,590 --> 01:35:28,380
-Come, David Lvovich.
-Come with us, please.

1357
01:35:28,460 --> 01:35:30,630
-Get up, David Lvovich.
-Wait.

1358
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:33,340
-Come with us.
-Follow our officer.

1359
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:39,420
David Lvovich, please, let's go.
David Lvovich.

1360
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:40,420
Stop.

1361
01:35:45,050 --> 01:35:46,750
Calm down, David Lvovich.

1362
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,960
I'm sorry. It was so awkward.

1363
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,500
What are you doing? You'll get hurt!

1364
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:14,000
Stop! Stop!

1365
01:36:14,460 --> 01:36:17,500
You drunk!
Where do you think you're going? Stop!

1366
01:36:17,630 --> 01:36:18,630
Freeze!

1367
01:36:21,250 --> 01:36:23,710
Police! Where are you going?

1368
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:26,170
You fool! Where are you going?

1369
01:36:27,090 --> 01:36:29,340
-What the hell?
-I'll call the neighborhood patrol!

1370
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:31,460
How will I show up at the parade
with a broken nose?

1371
01:36:31,670 --> 01:36:33,920
-Stop! Come back!
-Freeze!

1372
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,300
-You drunk!
-Where are you going? Freeze!

1373
01:36:38,210 --> 01:36:39,090
Freeze!

1374
01:36:42,420 --> 01:36:43,380
Stop!

1375
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:46,750
-Come back!
-Stop!

1376
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:47,710
That's it.

1377
01:36:55,710 --> 01:36:57,380
Sania, what's wrong with you? Sania?

1378
01:36:58,210 --> 01:36:59,210
Come here.

1379
01:37:00,210 --> 01:37:03,250
Senior Detective Major Fedorchuk,
Economic Security.

1380
01:37:03,340 --> 01:37:05,880
-Captain Obukhov.
-Your soldier ran over a man.

1381
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:08,420
-I was just driving, and...
-What were you looking at?

1382
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:10,800
-He jumped out...
-Where were your eyes?

1383
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:12,170
-I didn't see him.
-He's dead.

1384
01:37:12,250 --> 01:37:13,920
-Take care of this, Captain.
-Yes, sir.

1385
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,710
Where were your eyes, Private?

1386
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:18,460
I didn't see him. It was his fault!

1387
01:37:18,550 --> 01:37:21,460
-You hit a man.
-I didn't see him!

1388
01:37:21,550 --> 01:37:23,960
-It wasn't my fault! It was him.
-Jail...

1389
01:37:24,050 --> 01:37:27,880
-What shall we do?
-I'm so sorry!

1390
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:51,550
David Lvovich. Oh, my.

1391
01:37:54,210 --> 01:37:55,130
Is he dead?

1392
01:37:57,170 --> 01:37:58,170
He's not breathing.

1393
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:01,800
Keep moving, miss.

1394
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:03,960
Come on, Tisha.

1395
01:38:06,590 --> 01:38:08,340
Keep moving. There's nothing to see here.

1396
01:38:08,630 --> 01:38:09,960
-What happened?
-Tisha.

1397
01:38:10,250 --> 01:38:11,800
Young man, keep moving.

1398
01:38:12,170 --> 01:38:14,420
It's not that soldier's fault...

1399
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:19,840
Poor guy. This soldier will go to jail.
They'll interrogate him.

1400
01:38:28,710 --> 01:38:31,670
O Lord,
rest eternal grant to thy servant David,

1401
01:38:32,710 --> 01:38:35,000
forgive him his voluntary
and involuntary trespasses

1402
01:38:35,590 --> 01:38:38,300
and grant him the Kingdom of Heaven.
Lord, have mercy.

1403
01:38:38,670 --> 01:38:42,340
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name;

1404
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:46,500
thy kingdom come; thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

1405
01:38:47,050 --> 01:38:49,960
Give us this day our daily bread;
and forgive us our trespasses

1406
01:38:50,050 --> 01:38:52,050
as we forgive those
who trespass against us;

1407
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:58,550
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

1408
01:38:58,670 --> 01:38:59,880
Now, now.

1409
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:03,840
O Lord, rest eternal grant
to the newly departed David,

1410
01:39:04,210 --> 01:39:07,050
forgive him his voluntary and involuntary
trespasses and grant him

1411
01:39:07,130 --> 01:39:08,090
the Kingdom of Heaven.

1412
01:39:08,170 --> 01:39:09,170
Drink this.

1413
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,420
You'll be fine. You'll be fine.

1414
01:39:14,590 --> 01:39:17,340
-We'll never forget him.
-That's it.

1415
01:39:17,420 --> 01:39:20,340
Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy.

1416
01:39:20,420 --> 01:39:21,500
Easy, easy.

1417
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:23,550
Lord, have mercy.

1418
01:39:23,750 --> 01:39:24,750
Now, now.

1419
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:26,880
Do you hear me? Hang in there.

1420
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:29,710
We're always there for you.

1421
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:30,800
We won't abandon you.

1422
01:39:31,170 --> 01:39:34,710
Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy.

1423
01:39:36,210 --> 01:39:41,800
There will be a new, beautiful life.
We are all right here with you.

1424
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:44,750
Do you hear? Everything will pass.

1425
01:39:46,130 --> 01:39:48,920
You will have kids, a family.

1426
01:39:50,590 --> 01:39:53,960
We'll come to his grave together
to cry and to remember him.

1427
01:39:54,050 --> 01:39:58,710
And then your pain will go away.
It will pass.

1428
01:39:59,250 --> 01:40:04,000
Everything will be fine.
A new and beautiful life.

1429
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:09,130
There will be a new, beautiful life.
We are all right here with you.

1430
01:40:09,210 --> 01:40:12,000
Do you hear? Everything will pass.

1431
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,880
<i>I thought our books weren't published</i>
<i>and our paintings banned</i>

1432
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:33,250
<i>only because things we were</i>
<i>talking about didn't exist.</i>

1433
01:40:34,090 --> 01:40:35,630
<i>I mean, it did in real life,</i>

1434
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:38,500
<i>but the authorities pretended</i>
<i>it didn't exist.</i>

1435
01:41:03,130 --> 01:41:04,340
You look older.

1436
01:41:08,250 --> 01:41:10,210
When did they send you here?

1437
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:13,630
Was it 1961 or 1962? I'm not sure.

1438
01:41:15,460 --> 01:41:17,170
Straight from the university.

1439
01:41:19,090 --> 01:41:20,090
It will be raining.

1440
01:41:21,550 --> 01:41:24,920
It's not working for you, is it?

1441
01:41:27,050 --> 01:41:28,130
This place draws you back.

1442
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:30,920
I came back.

1443
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:33,960
For some reason,
I always thought I'd be a writer.

1444
01:41:34,050 --> 01:41:37,460
I wrote stories about prison guards,
convicts, and a kid from Leningrad

1445
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:39,590
who had been sent in to guard murderers.

1446
01:41:41,300 --> 01:41:42,300
Are you back?

1447
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:46,380
Remember, I told you
a true Estonian had to live in Canada.

1448
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:54,090
Now I understand they are all the same,
the soldiers and the convicts.

1449
01:41:54,170 --> 01:41:56,670
OK, I won't be a writer. So what?

1450
01:42:02,130 --> 01:42:03,340
I'm happy for you.

1451
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,960
It's so depressing.

1452
01:42:15,590 --> 01:42:16,630
Give way!

1453
01:42:19,090 --> 01:42:21,090
Freeze! I said freeze!

1454
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:28,050
Put the axe down!

1455
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:34,000
I found a rock that looks like an eye.
It's a bad omen.

1456
01:42:48,300 --> 01:42:50,250
<i>I often have dreams about the camp</i>
<i>I served at.</i>

1457
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:55,380
<i>According to Solzhenitsyn, camp is hell.</i>
<i>I think that we are the hell.</i>

1458
01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:58,710
NOVEMBER 6

1459
01:43:23,210 --> 01:43:25,500
Sergei, why didn't you come for so long?

1460
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:26,840
I couldn't.

1461
01:43:27,130 --> 01:43:29,670
I read your article about our shooting.

1462
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:36,840
As always, you were inappropriately
mocking the shooting of our film.

1463
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:38,420
There's almost no sarcasm in it.

1464
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:40,550
I didn't fabricate it.

1465
01:43:41,170 --> 01:43:43,960
Pushkin's fate is too tragic
to become a laughing matter.

1466
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:48,210
Your insinuations about Gogol's
alcoholism are ill-placed.

1467
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:49,880
I asked you to be elevated!

1468
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:54,460
I don't understand you. I trusted you
so much, and what did you do?

1469
01:43:55,420 --> 01:43:58,500
It's a great movie,
and you wrote all those things about us.

1470
01:43:59,550 --> 01:44:02,550
You've spoiled the celebration for us.
Maybe it's not a holiday for you,

1471
01:44:02,630 --> 01:44:03,840
but it is for me.

1472
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:06,960
Do you despise us?

1473
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:09,550
Of course not. I'm sorry.

1474
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:14,460
But they were terrible amateurs
pretending to be writers.

1475
01:44:14,550 --> 01:44:15,840
I respect classic literature.

1476
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:17,670
Now I see. Sergei!

1477
01:44:18,340 --> 01:44:20,380
Are you sneering at us?

1478
01:44:21,590 --> 01:44:22,630
Why are you sneering?

1479
01:44:22,710 --> 01:44:24,210
-Happy holidays.
-To you, too.

1480
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:26,550
-You promised us a sincere article.
-Happy holidays.

1481
01:44:26,630 --> 01:44:29,300
-Ania, what a nice festive hairdo.
-Don't touch me.

1482
01:44:29,380 --> 01:44:31,880
All right. I'm not touching anyone.
I was at the party.

1483
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:33,300
-Thanks a lot.
-Happy holidays.

1484
01:44:35,420 --> 01:44:36,300
Sergei.

1485
01:44:36,710 --> 01:44:38,340
-Have you lost your wig?
-What?

1486
01:44:38,590 --> 01:44:39,550
Gogol is drunk again.

1487
01:44:39,630 --> 01:44:41,300
So what? We are celebrating, Sergei.

1488
01:44:42,250 --> 01:44:44,090
Why are you mocking us? What's wrong?

1489
01:44:44,170 --> 01:44:45,210
-Hello.
-Hello.

1490
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:48,050
Our newspaper is positive.
What's wrong about it?

1491
01:44:48,170 --> 01:44:51,840
-Happy holidays.
-Thank you. You, too.

1492
01:44:52,550 --> 01:44:53,960
Come here, Snezhana.

1493
01:44:56,500 --> 01:44:59,250
Sergei. We'll have to fire you.

1494
01:45:00,340 --> 01:45:03,050
-That's right.
-Who's getting fired?

1495
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:04,550
We'll have to let you go.

1496
01:45:04,630 --> 01:45:06,590
I know you need money but...
you can't do it.

1497
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:11,420
Journalism has taken a back seat for you.

1498
01:45:13,590 --> 01:45:15,960
My advice is, go somewhere.

1499
01:45:16,840 --> 01:45:17,840
Maybe to Tallinn.

1500
01:45:18,670 --> 01:45:20,300
Maybe things will work for you there.

1501
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:22,500
Do you want to tell me something, Sergei?

1502
01:45:23,170 --> 01:45:25,710
Do you have 20 rubles?
I want to buy a doll for my daughter.

1503
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:27,420
Is that all?

1504
01:45:43,300 --> 01:45:44,300
Dovlatov.

1505
01:45:50,170 --> 01:45:53,000
Come on. Let's go party.

1506
01:45:57,880 --> 01:45:58,880
It's a nice car.

1507
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:03,800
The Mexican consul gave it to me.

1508
01:46:05,090 --> 01:46:06,300
Three hundred horsepower.

1509
01:46:08,130 --> 01:46:09,380
Before I forget...

1510
01:46:10,380 --> 01:46:13,670
Write a novel about Sparta in Greek.

1511
01:46:14,630 --> 01:46:17,800
It should be powerful like...
<i>War and Peace.</i>

1512
01:46:18,710 --> 01:46:20,130
We'll get it published.

1513
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:23,550
Come on, say yes.

1514
01:46:24,630 --> 01:46:27,380
-The Greeks fell victim...
-Hi.

1515
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:28,960
-...to social Darwinism.
-Hi.

1516
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:32,880
Want a cigarette?

1517
01:46:34,210 --> 01:46:36,840
It's the real deal. Imported.

1518
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:37,960
No, thanks.

1519
01:46:38,210 --> 01:46:40,550
-It's outstanding.
-Thank you.

1520
01:46:40,630 --> 01:46:42,300
You can only buy it at Beriozka.

1521
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:48,170
Semion promised to help me get
a part in the Sophocles play.

1522
01:46:48,670 --> 01:46:52,000
-Do you like Sophocles?
-Of course.

1523
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:54,960
A novel about the Greeks?

1524
01:46:56,210 --> 01:47:01,550
In a Greek polis, an average citizen
would never go away further...

1525
01:47:01,630 --> 01:47:04,090
-Are you an author?
-I'm a reporter.

1526
01:47:05,300 --> 01:47:09,340
It's a shame.
I think you could be a writer.

1527
01:47:10,380 --> 01:47:12,170
No, really, you should try.

1528
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:15,590
Write a detective, or something
about heroes. You look so manly.

1529
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:21,960
-And these strong shoulders...
-Thank you.

1530
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:26,750
You could do it. Give it a try.

1531
01:47:27,170 --> 01:47:30,050
-I don't want to.
-I'd love to read it.

1532
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:34,750
Sergei, did I tell you I was fond
of classical studies?

1533
01:47:35,420 --> 01:47:37,670
Yes. Sophocles. That's right.

1534
01:47:38,340 --> 01:47:40,460
What? You think I'm pathetic, right?

1535
01:47:41,090 --> 01:47:42,170
You look at me like this.

1536
01:47:42,250 --> 01:47:43,880
-Get lost, you freak.
-What?

1537
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:47,500
Go to hell, freak. Get lost.
Fuck off with your car and your money.

1538
01:47:47,590 --> 01:47:48,460
Are you an idiot?

1539
01:47:48,550 --> 01:47:50,460
And your chicks, and your dacha. Get lost!

1540
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:53,920
-What are you staring at?
-Are you out of it?

1541
01:47:54,170 --> 01:47:56,880
-What do you want from me?
-Wait until you want something from me.

1542
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:58,670
-What are you staring at?
-Are you a fool?

1543
01:47:58,750 --> 01:48:00,800
-Get lost!
-He's drunk.

1544
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:02,750
-Sergei.
-You keep lecturing people.

1545
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:06,340
Relax. What's wrong with you?
I said calm down.

1546
01:48:07,210 --> 01:48:10,500
-Pathetic, cunning people.
-What is this drama about? You...

1547
01:48:11,590 --> 01:48:12,630
Look at me.

1548
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:15,630
What was that? Why are you doing this?

1549
01:48:16,050 --> 01:48:19,670
I... I understand you.
I know what you're going through.

1550
01:48:19,750 --> 01:48:21,170
I've been there.

1551
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:23,250
I was in the same place you are now.

1552
01:48:23,340 --> 01:48:26,000
But I clenched my teeth
and got through it.

1553
01:48:26,550 --> 01:48:29,340
You'll clench your teeth, too. Look at me.

1554
01:48:29,420 --> 01:48:32,460
You'll clench your teeth
and get through it. You will.

1555
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:38,050
Write about those ancient Greeks.
It was a wonderful period.

1556
01:48:39,340 --> 01:48:41,750
-What's wrong with you?
-Get lost.

1557
01:48:43,590 --> 01:48:45,210
-Sergei, please calm down.
-Go.

1558
01:48:47,590 --> 01:48:48,500
Go.

1559
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:50,960
Go away.

1560
01:49:10,670 --> 01:49:14,210
They called me for a talk.
Threatened me with jail.

1561
01:49:19,670 --> 01:49:21,500
I borrowed some money for you from Liuda.

1562
01:49:24,630 --> 01:49:27,000
-Here, take it.
-Thank you.

1563
01:49:27,090 --> 01:49:28,130
You can pay it back later.

1564
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:38,340
I often have this dream about...
That we won't live long.

1565
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:47,880
It must be just a dream, right?

1566
01:49:53,090 --> 01:49:54,090
What were you saying?

1567
01:49:56,340 --> 01:49:57,250
Nothing.

1568
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:00,840
You keep hearing things.

1569
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:06,380
Van Gogh died in misery.

1570
01:50:06,460 --> 01:50:10,920
What does it matter if they publish you
in your home country?

1571
01:50:13,210 --> 01:50:15,550
It's all just... tribulations.

1572
01:50:18,170 --> 01:50:19,630
It's a pity, though.

1573
01:50:20,710 --> 01:50:26,460
On the other hand,
ice hockey is fascinating.

1574
01:50:32,210 --> 01:50:33,210
For good.

1575
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:43,960
For good.

1576
01:50:56,590 --> 01:50:57,590
Good job!

1577
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:22,300
For good.

1578
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:25,300
What? Is there a hot potato in your mouth?

1579
01:51:29,170 --> 01:51:30,170
I don't want to go.

1580
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:32,130
I won't be able to come back.

1581
01:51:34,340 --> 01:51:38,710
Soon, Joseph Brodsky would be forced to
leave the USSR under threat of an arrest.

1582
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:41,800
His parents would never get permission
to join him abroad.

1583
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:44,710
They would die in Leningrad
without ever seeing their son again.

1584
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:47,670
In 1987, Brodsky would be awarded
the Nobel Prize in Literature.

1585
01:51:47,750 --> 01:51:50,170
He would die in the US at 55
and be buried in Venice.

1586
01:51:50,250 --> 01:51:52,840
Brodsky is believed to be one of
the greatest Russian poets.

1587
01:51:57,880 --> 01:51:59,130
What happened?

1588
01:52:00,630 --> 01:52:02,710
-What happened?
-Nothing.

1589
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:06,050
Lena and Katia are here, waiting for you.

1590
01:52:07,210 --> 01:52:08,670
Katia is asleep already.

1591
01:52:09,630 --> 01:52:11,300
What a week!

1592
01:52:13,630 --> 01:52:16,420
Soon the holidays will pass,
and we'll go back to our lives.

1593
01:52:32,710 --> 01:52:34,250
Everything is so stupid and scary.

1594
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:37,380
There's no end to it.

1595
01:52:47,130 --> 01:52:48,840
I don't believe I'll ever get published.

1596
01:52:51,380 --> 01:52:52,800
What's the point, then?

1597
01:52:54,130 --> 01:52:57,420
I'm not doing it for money or other
vulgarities. I just can't help it.

1598
01:52:57,500 --> 01:52:58,500
It's just me.

1599
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:01,880
A part of me.

1600
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:07,250
When you grovel,
you lose something inside you,

1601
01:53:07,340 --> 01:53:09,550
and one day it will just disappear.

1602
01:53:15,210 --> 01:53:16,960
Maybe I should become a mason.

1603
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:26,130
My novel isn't working.

1604
01:53:27,460 --> 01:53:28,670
I won't get published.

1605
01:53:30,130 --> 01:53:32,340
I'm being sucked in.
I don't know how to get out of it.

1606
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:36,090
I just don't.

1607
01:53:44,130 --> 01:53:45,300
Come on, Sergei.

1608
01:53:50,130 --> 01:53:51,000
I can't.

1609
01:54:20,380 --> 01:54:22,130
You can't become a mason.

1610
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:30,130
You did the right thing.

1611
01:54:32,550 --> 01:54:33,880
Don't write this novel.

1612
01:54:34,750 --> 01:54:36,090
Don't listen to anyone.

1613
01:54:38,130 --> 01:54:39,670
Your books, your business.

1614
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:45,500
It won't be easy, but...
you'll find strength.

1615
01:54:47,340 --> 01:54:49,340
You'll find strength.
We will stand by you.

1616
01:54:51,340 --> 01:54:52,460
There will be books.

1617
01:54:55,170 --> 01:54:56,500
Everything will be fine.

1618
01:54:58,840 --> 01:55:00,170
Hush, Glasha.

1619
01:55:06,050 --> 01:55:07,300
Dad, are you sick?

1620
01:55:10,710 --> 01:55:12,630
The dog wants to go for a walk.

1621
01:55:18,130 --> 01:55:19,130
What's this?

1622
01:55:32,460 --> 01:55:33,960
Everything will be fine.

1623
01:55:36,170 --> 01:55:39,090
I don't know when, but we'll be fine.

1624
01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:42,250
We'll get through this.

1625
01:55:51,750 --> 01:55:54,460
-How are you?
-What are you doing for the holidays?

1626
01:55:55,460 --> 01:55:57,920
You don't know? Why?

1627
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:03,090
You look tired. It's hard for you.

1628
01:56:03,170 --> 01:56:05,380
It's OK. It's OK.

1629
01:56:08,090 --> 01:56:09,250
Are you guys drunk already?

1630
01:56:09,340 --> 01:56:12,380
I was telling him about your visit
to that dacha. He wants to go there, too.

1631
01:56:12,460 --> 01:56:13,550
Maybe he'll get lucky.

1632
01:56:13,670 --> 01:56:17,130
-Why are you laughing?
-It was funny, about the urologist.

1633
01:56:20,130 --> 01:56:22,000
Hi.

1634
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,050
Hi.

1635
01:56:30,130 --> 01:56:32,130
-Hey. How are you doing?
-OK.

1636
01:56:32,210 --> 01:56:33,250
How is your novel going?

1637
01:56:34,750 --> 01:56:35,920
It's not working so far.

1638
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:39,420
Writer's block. How are you? Your mom?

1639
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:43,250
I'm working at a restoration shop.

1640
01:56:57,920 --> 01:57:01,130
-Hello. Arguing again?
-It's a friendly discussion.

1641
01:57:01,550 --> 01:57:07,130
I've always respected you.
In any situation...

1642
01:57:07,210 --> 01:57:10,380
I shouldn't have started this. I'm sorry.

1643
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:12,250
-It's OK.
-Cheers.

1644
01:57:12,340 --> 01:57:14,340
We are free people, right?

1645
01:57:36,750 --> 01:57:41,420
Sergei Dovlatov's books would be
first published in his home country

1646
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:43,960
almost 20 years later.

1647
01:57:44,050 --> 01:57:48,800
In emigration, he would reunite
with his daughter Katia and wife Lena.

1648
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:52,130
He died in New York in 1990
at the age of 48 of a heart attack.

1649
01:57:52,210 --> 01:57:55,130
After his death,
Dovlatov would become a favorite writer

1650
01:57:55,210 --> 01:57:58,340
for millions of his compatriots,
being one of the 20th century's

1651
01:57:58,420 --> 01:58:00,340
most influential Russian writers.

1652
01:58:00,420 --> 01:58:02,800
Unfortunately,
he would never know about it.

1653
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,550
Sergei, give me a smile.

1654
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:24,920
Wait. Where is Dovlatov?

1655
01:58:26,340 --> 01:58:27,880
We'll scoot over.

1656
01:58:28,090 --> 01:58:30,920
Sergei! Get in. We'll sit on your knees.

1657
01:58:31,170 --> 01:58:32,710
There's enough room.

1658
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:36,460
There's no room. Let's go.

1659
01:58:36,550 --> 01:58:38,130
We'll have canned meat with potatoes.

1660
01:58:40,170 --> 01:58:42,170
What are you doing? What the hell?

1661
01:58:43,130 --> 01:58:44,210
Look at him!

1662
01:58:44,840 --> 01:58:46,590
A big man with a tender soul.

1663
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:54,460
Sergei. Are you OK there? Don't fall down.

1664
01:58:54,550 --> 01:58:55,500
I'm fine.

1665
01:58:56,090 --> 01:59:00,500
<i>This week was over,</i>
<i>with its big troubles and small joys.</i>

1666
01:59:02,170 --> 01:59:06,380
<i>I was sitting on that car roof,</i>
<i>thinking that we did exist after all,</i>

1667
01:59:07,590 --> 01:59:13,710
<i>with our worn-out coats and leaky shoes,</i>
<i>drinking, constantly arguing,</i>

1668
01:59:14,500 --> 01:59:15,880
<i>poor and sometimes talented.</i>

1669
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:19,090
<i>We were, and we would be,</i>

1670
01:59:20,630 --> 01:59:23,840
<i>in spite of everything,</i>
<i>in spite of all problems.</i>

1671
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:28,300
<i>Also,</i>
<i>I was thinking that the only honest path</i>

1672
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:32,340
<i>was the path of mistakes,</i>
<i>disappointments, and hopes.</i>

1673
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:41,670
The filmmakers are grateful
to the people of St. Petersburg

1674
01:59:41,750 --> 01:59:43,550
for their help and support.
