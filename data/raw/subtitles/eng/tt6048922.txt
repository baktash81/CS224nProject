1
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,916
<i>Twice in a
single generation,</i>

2
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:45,295
<i>the catastrophe of world war
has fallen upon us.</i>

3
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:50,092
<i>Twice in our lifetime
has the long arm of fate</i>

4
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,135
<i>reached out across the oceans</i>

5
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:55,931
<i>to bring the United States
into the forefront of the battle.</i>

6
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:59,810
<i>Our American
merchant ships must be free</i>

7
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:04,313
to carry our American goods
into the harbors of our friends.

8
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:10,279
And our American merchant ships
must be protected by our American Navy.

9
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:15,450
<i>The brunt of the war
has fallen upon the sailormen,</i>

10
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:18,787
<i>and we have lost nearly 3,000 lives</i>

11
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:23,000
<i>in a hard,
unrelenting struggle,</i>

12
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,670
<i>which goes on night and day</i>

13
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,883
<i>and is going on now
without a moment's respite.</i>

14
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:34,845
The goods will be
delivered by this nation,

15
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,682
whose navy believes in the tradition

16
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:42,352
of "damn the torpedoes,
full speed ahead."

17
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:12,943
"Dear Lord,
let your holy angel be with me,

18
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:17,739
that the evil foe may have no power
over me. Amen."

19
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:50,647
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

20
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:12,711
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

21
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,296
Cigars?

22
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,386
"Yesterday, today and forever."

23
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,389
That's beautiful.
I'll put it on my tree.

24
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,602
All right.
Your turn. Come on.

25
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,895
All right.

26
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,195
<i>Monogrammed.</i>

27
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:42,658
What's this?

28
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,370
<i>Congratulations.</i>

29
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,872
<i>Your first command.</i>
At last.

30
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,415
Aw.

31
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:55,712
<i>After all those years of being fitted
and retained, a Fletcher-class destroyer.</i>

32
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,256
<i>You deserve it.</i>

33
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,509
I knew after <i>Pearl Harbor</i>
they would be needing men like you.

34
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,137
I report to Norfolk
right after the first of the year.

35
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,516
Norfolk?
Not Treasure Island?

36
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,518
That's the navy in a nutshell,
isn't it?

37
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,228
Yeah.

38
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,357
Then the Caribbean
for training and tactics.

39
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,944
<i>Jamaica, the Bahamas, Cuba.
Rum and Coca-Cola.</i>

40
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,238
- Mm.
- Then active duty.

41
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,740
Come with me.

42
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:26,994
I mean it.

43
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,583
So I can ask you to marry me
on a tropical beach.

44
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,547
Oh, I'd like that,
but we can't.

45
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,843
The world has gone crazy, Ernie.

46
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,137
Let's wait until we can be together.

47
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:05,532
I will always be looking for you, Evie.

48
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:08,160
No matter where I am.

49
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,788
Even if I'm a thousand miles away,

50
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:15,042
I will be hoping I'll see you
come around the corner.

51
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:20,547
<i>Because when you do, it's...
It's the greatest feeling in the world.</i>

52
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,204
- Morning.
- Morning, Captain.

53
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,873
Charlie, how are the overnights?

54
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:56,542
Convoy's three days into the Pit.

55
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,253
No contacts, no incidents,
except on your ship, sir.

56
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,881
Two bored sailors with time
on their hands, which became fists.

57
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:04,967
Who?
<i>Shannon and Flusser.</i>

58
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,386
- Crew's getting nervous, Ernie.
- Sleep well, sir?

59
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,180
I've never had the gift
for sleeping on board.

60
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,933
Hmm.
And I can't sleep anywhere else, sir.

61
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:20,232
- Amen.
- Amen.

62
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,609
Sea's a bit high to serve hot food.

63
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,862
I could manage a ham steak
and eggs for you, sir.

64
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,239
- This will do. Thank you, Cleveland.
- Aye, aye, Captain.

65
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:33,120
<i>Report to the commanding officer.
Clear the room.</i>

66
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,211
<i>Uncover.</i>

67
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:57,144
Explain yourselves.

68
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,105
<i>Flusser.</i>

69
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,024
I regret the incident, sir.

70
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:04,818
Shannon.

71
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:08,071
I too regret the incident.

72
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,753
I will tolerate no more fisticuffs
on my ship.

73
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,379
So...

74
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:28,217
"restore the relationships you have
damaged and fill me with peace."

75
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,097
Sir?

76
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,227
<i>Captain requested,
bridge, sir. Captain requested, bridge.</i>

77
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:44,608
<i>Repetition will bring hell
down from on high.</i>

78
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,111
<i>Back to your duties.</i>

79
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:50,447
<i>Count your blessings.</i>

80
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,158
Captain on the bridge.

81
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,661
Aye.

82
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,037
Sir, good morning.

83
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,374
<i>Escorts Eagle and Harry are
out of position, six miles from convoy.</i>

84
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,919
<i>They've been off on their own, sir,
for roughly two hours.</i>

85
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,368
<i>Eagle skipper announced,</i>
"Starting the day with a good hunt," sir,

86
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,726
<i>and then Harry joined in.</i>

87
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:33,834
<i>Message from
the commodore, sir.</i>

88
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:35,325
Read it out.

89
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:39,413
<i>"Comconvoy to Comescort.
H-U-F-F D-U-F-F"...</i>

90
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,749
<i>"Huff Duff." High-frequency
direction finding. Continue, please.</i>

91
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:47,254
<i>"Huff Duff reports a German transmission
bearing 087 degrees.</i>

92
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,548
<i>Range 15 to 20 miles."</i>

93
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,425
<i>Commodore says
a likely U-boat, sir.</i>

94
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:59,183
<i>"Comescort to Comconvoy.
Will run it down."</i>

95
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,946
<i>"Comescort to Comconvoy.
Will run it down."</i>

96
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:02,537
Wait, wait. "Will run it down.
Thank you."

97
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:03,955
<i>"Will run it down. Thank you."
Aye, aye, sir.</i>

98
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:06,523
- Mister Carling, I have the conn.
- Captain has the conn.

99
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,650
All ahead full.
<i>Make turns for 36 knots.</i>

100
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:11,403
<i>All ahead full.
Make turns for 36 knots. Aye, sir.</i>

101
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,363
<i>Right standard rudder, 079.</i>

102
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,657
<i>Right standard rudder to 079.
Aye, aye, sir.</i>

103
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,623
<i>All escorts, Greyhound.
Return to your stations immediately.</i>

104
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:27,753
<i>We have enemy contact bearing 087,
range 15 to 20 miles.</i>

105
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,272
- Aye, sir.
- Aye, aye, sir.

106
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,056
Aye, Greyhound.
Dicky, Greyhound.

107
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:34,384
- Dicky, sir.
- Modify your station to assist the convoy

108
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:35,761
on the starboard side.

109
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,347
Stragglers are mistiming
the course change.

110
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,266
Keep your sonar on
that starboard flank.

111
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,602
Aye, sir.
Sonar, starboard flank.

112
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:44,925
Right full rudder, 087.

113
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,105
<i>Right full rudder to 087.
Aye, aye, sir.</i>

114
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:49,989
- Bring us up to general quarters.
- Boatswain, sound general quarters.

115
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:55,757
General quarters,
general quarters...

116
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:57,717
Move. Let's go.
All hands, man your battle stations.

117
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,868
We are running down
a possible U-boat contact.

118
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,763
Let's hammer
those sons of bitches.

119
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,295
Keep 'em coming, Cleveland.

120
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:16,426
<i>Eagle, Greyhound. Take
my position at the front of the convoy.</i>

121
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,970
We're pursuing the target.

122
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:19,888
Dicky, Greyhound.
Cover the right flank.

123
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:21,890
Front of convoy.
Aye, aye, sir.

124
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:23,892
Aye, sir.
Covering right flank.

125
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,144
Eagle, Harry, Greyhound.

126
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:28,438
What is your ETA
for resuming new stations?

127
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,733
<i>Greyhound, Eagle.
We can be at our station in 20 minutes.</i>

128
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:35,696
<i>Harry, sir. We're now four miles
to port of the convoy.</i>

129
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:39,908
<i>Yes, I know, Harry.
Return to your station at best speed.</i>

130
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,995
<i>Sir, I relieved Mister Carling.
Have the deck and the conn.</i>

131
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:46,790
<i>Mister Watson, we have a target
bearing 087, range 15 to 20 miles.</i>

132
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:48,977
- I have the conn.
- Aye, aye, sir. Captain has the conn.

133
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,294
Messenger. Sir.

134
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,689
Go to my cabin and bring me
my sheepskin coat. You'll find it.

135
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:53,714
Aye, aye, sir.

136
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,758
Combat, Conn. Charlie.

137
00:11:56,842 --> 00:12:01,638
<i>We're running down a likely sub
bearing 087, range 15 to 20 miles.</i>

138
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:04,308
I'm hoping it shows up
on your surface radar.

139
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:06,727
Conn, Combat.
Aye, aye, sir.

140
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:17,613
Now hear this,
now hear this.

141
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,158
This is the captain.

142
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:22,910
We are running down the target.

143
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:26,580
<i>Let us attend our duties well.
This is what we've trained for.</i>

144
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,916
- Martin, what you got?
- Nothing yet, sir.

145
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,844
Got him.

146
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:47,267
<i>Conn, Combat. Target bearing 092,
range 15 miles.</i>

147
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,144
Charlie, what do you make of this target?

148
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:50,979
Most likely a U-boat, sir.

149
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:54,525
<i>Up for air and a battery charge.
Gettin' ready to come at us, Captain.</i>

150
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,988
<i>Steady on 092, sir.</i>

151
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:01,698
Very well.

152
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:11,708
<i>Conn, Combat. Target bearing steady
at 094, range 12 miles.</i>

153
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:14,795
<i>Weapons, pass the word,
do not open fire without orders from me.</i>

154
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,761
<i>Range 11 miles,
bearing steady on 094.</i>

155
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:25,681
<i>Range 11 miles,
bearing steady on 094.</i>

156
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,023
Stop that noise.

157
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:38,527
<i>Range 9.5 miles,
bearing steady on 094.</i>

158
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,781
Close enough for the five-inch, sir.

159
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,160
Heavy seas, Mister Watson,
with only a radar bearing.

160
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,788
Let's have our eyes on him.

161
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:50,873
Aye, aye, sir.

162
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:17,274
<i>Target's disappeared, sir.
Fell off the radar about six miles out.</i>

163
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:19,902
What's this, Charlie?

164
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,754
Looks like he's dived, sir,
by the way the pips faded out.

165
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,281
<i>He must've seen us, sir.
Got his air and dove.</i>

166
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,742
Pips had him on course for us
and the convoy, sir.

167
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,368
Can you plot a search radius?

168
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:31,872
I could, sir, but in ten minutes,
the radius would be three square miles.

169
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,126
Give me a course to intercept

170
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,921
if the target maintains this course
at six knots.

171
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,047
Aye, aye, sir.

172
00:14:57,147 --> 00:15:00,526
<i>Conn, Combat.

173
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:03,570
Warn me two miles out
from this intercept.

174
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:04,780
Aye, aye, sir.

175
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:06,615
Right handsomely, 096.

178
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:32,266
<i>Mister Watson, we need to slow down
for sonar. Make turns for 22 knots.</i>

179

00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,053
<i>Contact bearing steady at 091.</i>

189
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:12,347
<i>He's turned.
Looks like he's running from us, sir.</i>

190
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:13,432
Any screw noises?

Sorry, my language, sir.

Mister Watson,
steady on a reciprocal course.

00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,232
- Maintain our present heading.
- Aye, aye, sir.

- Escorts, Greyhound.

of the convoy in...

Oil!

277
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:15,794

Debris.

<i>Sonar reports crunch
of a sinking vessel, sir.</i>

282
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,293
We got him.

283
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:01,256
Pipe it.

284
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:09,014
Now hear this.
Now hear this.

285
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:13,810
<i>This is the captain.
It seems we sank that target.</i>

286
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:15,103
This was an all-hands job.

287
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:18,398
Well done.

288
00:23:20,484 --> 00:23:22,861
<i>Secure from general quarters.
Take us to Condition 3</i>

289
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:24,863
<i>and arrange for hot food

290

Secure from general quarters.

292
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,160
<i>All hands,
secure from general quarters.</i>

293
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:34,414
<i>Escorts, Greyhound.
We have sighted evidence of a kill.</i>

294
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:37,835
<i>Congratulations, Captain.
More food for the fish.</i>

295
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:39,336
The prize is yours, sir,

296
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,672
but we'll need evidence of a kill
for the Admiralty.

297
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:44,258
Nothin' but the captain's trousers
will do, I'm afraid.

298
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:45,717
Just return to station.

299
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:48,053
Congratulations, sir.

300
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:50,639
Shall I steer a course for the debris
to verify the kill?

301
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:53,767
No, Mister Watson.

302
00:23:53,851 --> 00:23:55,894
<i>Convoy is unguarded.
Take us back to station.</i>

303
00:23:56,979 --> 00:23:59,648
<i>Aye, aye, sir.
Helmsman, bring us back to station.</i>

304
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:01,024
Eppstine, is it?

305
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:02,860
Eppstein, sir.

306
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:04,903
Good work.
Thank you.

307
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:06,572
It's why I'm aboard, sir.

308
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:11,243
Hey, Cap, pulled this corned beef
and onion, sliced thick for you.

309
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:12,494
Gotta eat, sir.

310
00:24:12,578 --> 00:24:15,330
Nah, take that to Lieutenant Cole.

311
00:24:15,414 --> 00:24:17,249
I bet he's worked up an appetite.

312
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:20,377
Now, Mister Dawson.

313
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,753
It's from the Admiralty, sir.

314
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:24,506
<i>They've intercepted
multiple German transmissions.</i>

315
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,924

00:24:27,593 --> 00:24:30,262
"Enemy activity expected

317
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:47,738
Congratulations, Captain.

<i>It's our first U-boat.</i>

319
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:53,952
Congratulations, sir.
Fifty less krauts.

320
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:56,747
Yes. Fifty souls.

321
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:02,169
Sir, permission to secure
boilers two and four?

322
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:04,338
Mister Nystrom,
are you not the officer of the deck?

323
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:05,714
Yes, sir, I am, sir.

324
00:25:05,797 --> 00:25:08,078
Then take that to the chief engineer
without bothering me.

325
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:11,470
<i>Aye, sir.
Uh, our noon position report, sir.</i>

326
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:14,306
I'm estimating we are at Position Oboe

327
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:16,350
in the North Atlantic,
surrounded by open sea.

328
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:18,143
- That about right?
- If you say so, sir.

329
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:20,729
Take us back to station
ahead of the convoy, center column.

330
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:22,648
Ahead of convoy, center column.
Aye, sir.

Shall I see it stowed away?</i>

336
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:55,222
Yes, thank you.

337
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:00,394
<i>Sir,</i>

338
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:03,730
<i>noon fuel reports will be slightly off
due to that U-boat chase.</i>

339
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:05,250
<i>Still waiting on reports from Dodge,</i>

340
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:08,026
<i>but Viktor and James are reporting
diminishing reserves.</i>

341
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,444
<i>Send a reply.</i>

342
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:15,367
<i>"Comescort to James. Please use
utmost efforts to conserve fuel."</i>

343
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,493
Aye, sir.

344
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:19,848
Sir, after that last pattern,
now might be a good time

345
00:26:19,872 --> 00:26:22,350
to bring up the extra supply of depth
charges stowed in the crew quarters.

346
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:24,376
<i>Permission granted. Thank you.</i>
Aye, sir.

347
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:35,947
<i>Two distress rockets...</i>

348
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:38,724
<i>Forward Lookout reports
two distress rockets rear of the convoy.</i>

349
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,101
<i>Reciprocal course.</i>

350
00:26:41,185 --> 00:26:43,729
- Mister Nystrom, I have the conn.
- Captain has the conn.

351
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:53,113
Where?

352
00:26:53,197 --> 00:26:55,324
There, sir.
That's the Despotiko, sir.

353
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:57,492
<i>She's a merchant ship.
Last ship in the line.</i>

354
00:27:02,164 --> 00:27:04,625
<i>Signals report commodore
signaling general alarm, sir.</i>

355
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:06,960
<i>Mister Nystrom,
come left at 200.</i>

356
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:08,962
Alert all escorts,
"I'm going to the rear."

357
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:12,591
<i>Send in Cadena for rescue
and bring us up to general quarters.</i>

358
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:16,678
<i>General quarters. General quarters.
All hands, man your battle stations.</i>

359
00:27:16,762 --> 00:27:20,015
All ahead standard.
Sonar, resume sweeps.

360
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:22,684

Resume sweeps.

361

<i>Torpedo! Torpedo!
Bearing 205, range 500.</i>

362
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:53,924

- There, sir.

363
00:27:57,678 --> 00:28:00,055
- Right full rudder.
- Right full rudder. Aye, aye, sir.

364
00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:06,246
Shoot me a bearing
of where that came from.

365
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,437
Yes, sir.

366
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:17,614
<i>Bearing 160.</i>

367
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:20,492
Charlie,
I'm steering to avoid a single torpedo.

368
00:28:20,576 --> 00:28:22,369
<i>Point of origin, 160.</i>

369
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:25,914
<i>Mister Nystrom, bring us around to port
in a reciprocal course</i>

370
00:28:25,998 --> 00:28:27,124
<i>into screening position.</i>

371
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:29,209
Put us between Cadena and that U-boat.

372
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,713
- Screen Cadena. Aye. Left full rudder.
- Left full rudder. Aye, sir.

373
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:34,089
<i>All ahead flank.</i>

374

<i>Message from Cadena, sir.
She signals rescue completed.</i>

375
00:28:38,594 --> 00:28:39,595
Thank you.

376
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:41,805
- Messenger.
- Captain.

377
00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:43,807
Write this. "Comescort to Cadena."

378
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:46,977
<i>Rejoin convoy at best speed.
Modified zigzag."</i>

379
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,478

383
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:07,473
- Sonar, sweep to starboard.
- Sonar, Bridge. Sweep to starboard.

384
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:10,083
Mister Nystrom, ease the rudder.
Meet her.

385
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:11,793
Maintain this screening position.

386
00:29:11,877 --> 00:29:14,046
Holding this course.
Aye, aye, sir.

387
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:19,384
Zigzag right.
Ten degrees rudder.

388
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:21,595
Right ten degrees rudder.
Aye, sir.

389
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:27,184
Steady at ten degrees, sir.

390
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:30,229
- Steady as you go.
- Steady as I go.

391
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:32,032
Return message
from Cadena, sir.

392
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:36,610
<i>She's two hours from convoy, sir.
Reports 42 men rescued from Despotiko.</i>

393
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:39,530
Very well.
Thank you.

394
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:41,593
Skipper, we're freezing up.

395
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:44,385
I've given orders for the steam hoses
to keep the depth charges clear.

396
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:46,954
Greyhound, Harry.
Greyhound, Harry.

397
00:29:47,663 --> 00:29:48,705
Greyhound.

398
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:51,250
Pips on the radar screen,
bearing 091, sir.

399
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,627
Looks like two subs
directly ahead of the convoy.

400
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,921
<i>Range 10 miles.
Harry has two contacts, 10 miles.</i>

401
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:57,381
- Dicky, sir.
- Go ahead, Dicky.

402
00:29:57,464 --> 00:30:00,634
<i>We got a pip, bearing 098,
range 14 miles.</i>

403
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:03,387
<i>Greyhound, Eagle.
We've got Harry's pip, sir, and another.</i>

404
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:06,640
<i>Bearing 090,
range 13 miles.</i>

405
00:30:07,224 --> 00:30:09,351
Very well.
Four contacts now.

406
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:11,186
Zigzag 20 degrees.
Left standard rudder.

407
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,206
<i>Twenty degrees.
Left standard rudder. Aye, sir.</i>

408
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,833
Eagle here,
with another pip on the move.

409
00:30:14,857 --> 00:30:16,626
- Range five miles, bearing 07...
- Another. Five miles,

410
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:17,901
dead ahead of the convoy.

411
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:20,946
<i>Greyhound, Harry.
Nine miles to one pip at 090.</i>

412
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:23,240
<i>The other bearing 092, range eight miles.</i>

413
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:24,658
Are the ranges closing?

414
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:27,327
<i>Negative, Greyhound.
They seem to be behaving at present.</i>

415
00:30:27,411 --> 00:30:29,371
Very well.
<i>Maintain your stations.</i>

416
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:31,248
<i>Attack within range and good luck.</i>

417
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:37,421
<i>A wolf pack shadowing us.
They'll attack as a group.</i>

418
00:30:38,589 --> 00:30:41,925
Yeah, waiting for nightfall,
when we can't see nothing.

419
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:45,345
I need you down below.

420
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:47,710
Keep an eye on the surface radar
for our friend back here.

421
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:48,849
Aye, aye, sir.

422
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,208
<i>Six subs, guys.
We got a contact report from Eagle?</i>

423
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:16,478
<i>Aye, sir, got 'em all.
They're keeping their distance.</i>

424
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:19,254
Five ahead of the convoy
and our little dance partner back here,

425
00:31:19,338 --> 00:31:22,674
<i>tracking us and the Cadena.
Presumed bearing 196.</i>

426
00:31:51,703 --> 00:31:53,583
- Signal from the commodore, sir.
- Read it out.

427
00:31:54,206 --> 00:31:55,749
"Comconvoy to Comescort.

428
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:59,461
Numerous German language transmissions
10 to 15 miles ahead. Various bearings."

429
00:32:00,212 --> 00:32:01,213
Very well.

430
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:04,174
I need the gloves you'll find
in my cabin. The fur, not the knit.

431
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:05,801
Gloves. Fur, not knit.
Aye, aye, sir.

432
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:20,691
Chief Rudel,
I need these wipers operating.

433
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:23,026
It's not electrical, sir.
They're frozen.

434
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,487
I can put some men on it
with buckets and swabs.

435
00:32:25,571 --> 00:32:27,781
Salt water.
Warm salt water, not boiling.

436
00:32:27,865 --> 00:32:29,074
Aye, sir.

437
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:33,537
<i>Conn, Combat. Looks like our friend's
come up for fresh air</i>

438
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,247
<i>and to maintain speed with us, sir.</i>

439
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:39,501
<i>Contact bearing 207,

00:32:41,587 --> 00:32:43,755
<i>Hard right rudder to 207.</i>
Aye, sir.

442
00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:55,475
<i>Target now bears 208.</i>

443
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:59,396
<i>Target now bears 208.
Range...</i>

444
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:01,940
<i>Range looks like 2.5 miles.</i>

445
00:33:02,024 --> 00:33:03,650
<i>Looks like 2.5 miles.</i>

446
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:05,086
- What's goin' on?
- I don't know, sir.

447
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,278
I can't get a good read.

448
00:33:09,031 --> 00:33:10,741
Come right to 220.

449
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:12,826
<i>Come right to 220.</i>
Aye, sir.

450
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:16,079
<i>What do you mean, "looks like"?
I need a bearing on this target, Charlie.</i>

451
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:17,706
It's my radar, sir.
It's gone soft.

452
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:20,083
- I need Rudel down here.
- Understood.

453
00:33:20,626 --> 00:33:23,045
Have Chief Rudel report to the XO
in the CIC.

454
00:33:23,128 --> 00:33:24,880
Mister Lopez, all mounts, local control.

455
00:33:24,963 --> 00:33:26,507
- Fire when they bear.
- Aye, aye, sir.

456
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:29,760
<i>All mounts, local control.
Fire as you bear.</i>

457
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:34,473
<i>Bearing's changing.
Uh, 203. Range...</i>

458
00:33:34,556 --> 00:33:37,434
<i>Contact bearing's changing, 203.</i>

459
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:41,480
<i>Range looks like 2.5 miles.
203, range 2.5 miles.</i>

460
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:43,190
Firing on target,

00:33:44,816 --> 00:33:46,944
<i>Left standard rudder to 180.</i>
Aye, sir.

463
00:33:47,027 --> 00:33:50,364
U-boat, starboard bow!

464
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:02,835
<i>Fire Control reports
five-inch mounts opened fire on target.</i>

465

Messenger, take this to Signals.

468
00:34:10,259 --> 00:34:11,552
"Greyhound to Cadena."

469
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:15,138
Must return to station at head of convoy
to engage targets.

470
00:34:15,222 --> 00:34:17,056
<i>Fired on U-boat.
Drove him under.</i>

471
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:20,268
<i>"Have faith you will outrun him.
Good luck."</i>

472
00:34:20,351 --> 00:34:21,395
Send that.

473
00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:23,063
You wanted to see me, sir?

474
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:24,958
<i>Yeah. What can we do
about this damn interference?</i>

475
00:34:24,982 --> 00:34:27,109
<i>It's not interference, sir.
I checked everything.</i>

476
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:28,792
The pilot light's on,
no surge currents,

477
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:30,654
and I reset the overload relay
four days ago.

478
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:35,449
I could reset it again, but we're gonna be
down nearly two hours. Waste of time, sir.

479
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,541
Bridge.

480
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:45,252
"The night cometh
when no man can work," Ernie.

481
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:47,129
Rudel's done all he can.

482
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:50,340
We're just gonna have to live with
the radar how it is for now, Captain.

483
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:52,509
Understood.
Thank you, Charlie.

484
00:35:37,638 --> 00:35:41,225
<i>Captain, need to slow
in the sea, or we risk blowing a turbine.</i>

485
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:42,684
Understood.

486
00:35:42,768 --> 00:35:44,937
<i>Mister Harbutt, she can't take it.
Slow us down a bit.</i>

487
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,564
- All ahead two-thirds.
- All ahead two-thirds. Aye, aye, sir.

488
00:35:47,648 --> 00:35:49,858
- Darken the ship.
- Shift to red.

489
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:52,253
You missed another meal, sir.

490
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:54,905
Brought you a bacon and egg sandwich,
still warm.

491
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:56,740
I found some of those peaches you like.

492
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:05,707
Amen.

493
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:06,792
Amen.

494
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:08,335
I'll keep the coffee coming, sir.

495
00:36:08,794 --> 00:36:10,754
- Coffee, Mister Harbutt?
- Thank you, sir.

496
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:16,134
<i>Distress rockets, sir.</i>

497
00:36:16,218 --> 00:36:19,388
<i>Lookouts report gunfire, bearing 046,
range three miles.</i>

498
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:23,451
- I'll take it, Mister Harbutt.

00:36:30,524 --> 00:36:32,150
All hands,
man your battle stations.

503
00:36:32,234 --> 00:36:35,445
<i>Set Condition 1 throughout the ship.
Lock down all watertight passageways.</i>

All mounts, fire at will.

506
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,980
All mounts, fire at will.

507
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:49,835
Merchant ship dead ahead!

508
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,965
Check fire!

509
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:57,968
- Hard left rudder, hard over!
- Check fire! Cease fire!

510
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:19,823
Right standard rudder!

511
00:37:19,907 --> 00:37:21,909
Right standard rudder.
Aye, aye, sir.

512
00:37:32,878 --> 00:37:34,796
All ahead standard!

513
00:37:37,883 --> 00:37:39,718

All ahead standard.
Aye, aye, sir.

All ahead standard!

516
00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:48,977
U-boat!

517
00:37:49,061 --> 00:37:50,145
Where?

518
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:54,358
<i>U-boat bearing 012, range 1,000!
Between us and the freighters!</i>

519
00:38:02,658 --> 00:38:04,743
Check! Check! Check!

520
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:07,162
Mister Lopez,
you have freighters in the line of fire!

521
00:38:07,246 --> 00:38:09,831
Cease fire, cease fire.
All batteries, check fire!

522
00:38:09,915 --> 00:38:11,834
Cease fire!
Cease fire!

526
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:41,172
- Right full rudder, all ahead two-thirds.
- Right full rudder. Aye, aye, sir.

527
00:38:41,196 --> 00:38:43,407
Mister Lopez,
prepare to engage that target.

528
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:46,177
When he dives, we're gonna hammer him
with two patterns Shallow, then deep.

529
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:47,119
Aye, sir!

530
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:51,248
<i>That's the Vasco, sir!
She's an oil tanker. She could blow!</i>

531
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:54,751
Mind your helm across the column!

532
00:38:54,835 --> 00:38:56,187
Minding my helm.
Aye, aye, sir.

533
00:38:56,211 --> 00:38:58,523
- Slow to one-third.
- Slow to one-third. Aye, sir.

534
00:38:58,547 --> 00:39:00,716
- Watch that merchantman.
- Aye, sir.

535
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:06,096
<i>He's diving!
U-boat diving, bearing 040.</i>

536
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,389
Range close aboard!

537
00:39:08,223 --> 00:39:09,516
- Mister Lopez.
- Aye, sir.

538
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,893
Stand by for shallow pattern.

539
00:39:10,976 --> 00:39:12,728
<i>Stand by for shallow pattern.
Aye, aye, sir!</i>

540
00:39:12,811 --> 00:39:14,646
Sonar, sweep for contact
to starboard beam.

541
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:16,940
<i>Sonar, Bridge.
Sweep for contact to starboard beam.</i>

542
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:21,462
<i>Bridge, Sonar. There's too many screws.
I can't hear anything.</i>

543
00:39:21,486 --> 00:39:23,614
<i>Sonar reports mixed signals, sir.
Too many propellers.</i>

544
00:39:23,697 --> 00:39:25,449
- On my command, Mister Lopez.
- Aye, sir.

545
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,013
<i>Still too many screws.
Interference from the convoy.</i>

546
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:32,597
<i>Sonar reports too many screws, sir.
Interference from the convoy.</i>

547
00:39:47,304 --> 00:39:48,555
I got something.

548
00:39:56,146 --> 00:39:58,273
<i>Got 'em. Contact close.
Starboard beam 083.</i>

549
00:39:58,357 --> 00:40:00,484
<i>Sonar reports contact close.
Starboard beam 083, sir.</i>

550
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:02,194
<i>Correction, starboard beam 088, sir.</i>

551
00:40:02,277 --> 00:40:03,320
Now, Mister Lopez!

552
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:05,989
<i>Fire, fire! Roll two, fire.
Port to starboard.</i>

553
00:40:13,038 --> 00:40:14,623
Next pattern,
Mister Lopez.

554
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:15,749
Again, sir?

555
00:40:15,832 --> 00:40:17,292
Yes, again,
Mister Lopez!

556
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:20,838
<i>All positions, fire when ready.
All positions, fire, fire!</i>

557
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:22,464
Helm, meet her!
Head up the lane!

558
00:40:22,548 --> 00:40:25,175
<i>Meet her.
Heading up the lane. Aye, aye, sir.</i>

559
00:40:34,852 --> 00:40:35,894
Come on.

560
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:39,374
<i>- Sonar reports contact bearing...
- Correction.</i>

561
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:41,709
<i>Correction. Sonar reports...
Questionable screw noises.</i>

562
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:43,318
<i>Questionable screw noises.</i>

563
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:45,112
<i>Contact stationary.</i>

564
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:46,822
<i>Sonar reports contact stationary.</i>

565
00:40:46,905 --> 00:40:47,990
Stationary?

566
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:50,158
Sonar, Bridge.
Anything further?

567
00:40:56,748 --> 00:40:58,584
Still stationary.
Possible decoy.

568
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:02,921
<i>Sonar reports contact is not moving.
Possible decoy.</i>

569
00:41:17,186 --> 00:41:18,353
The tanker, sir!

570
00:41:30,073 --> 00:41:33,869
<i>Survivors! Men in the water!
Port bow! Port bow!</i>

571
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,622
<i>Contact.
Bearing starboard 538, 538.</i>

572
00:41:36,705 --> 00:41:37,956
<i>Distance 200 yards.</i>

573
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,459
- Mister Harbutt, who's your junior?
- Wallace, sir.

574
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:41,835
Get him out here.

575
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:47,508
Sir, a message from Cadena.

576
00:41:47,591 --> 00:41:48,592
Read it out.

577
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:50,594
"Merchant ships vulnerable
at rear of convoy.

578
00:41:50,677 --> 00:41:52,888
<i>Attack imminent.
Request your earliest assistance."</i>

579
00:41:55,182 --> 00:41:58,769
Captain, survivors 500 yards starboard,
sir. Proceed with rescue?

580
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,737
Get down to midships,
put down a scrambling net

581
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,448
- and get those men out of the water.
- Aye, aye, sir.

582
00:42:11,532 --> 00:42:13,659
Stop engines.
All slow astern.

583
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:15,911
Mister Harbutt,
you have the conn.

584
00:42:15,994 --> 00:42:18,705
Mind the debris and hail me
the moment Wallace has them aboard.

585
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:20,123
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Signals?

586
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:22,084
- Aye, sir.
- "Comescort to Cadena."

587
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:27,673
"Will assist as soon as possible."

588
00:42:28,215 --> 00:42:29,466
Aye, sir.

589
00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:40,561
Give me your hand.
Keep climbing.

590
00:42:41,103 --> 00:42:46,191
<i>Krauts call it a Pillenwerfer, sir.
It's German for something.</i>

591
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:47,568
"Pill-thrower."

592
00:42:47,651 --> 00:42:49,736
- Yes, go on.
- Uh, I'd never heard of one before,

593
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:54,032
but I got a buddy who was on the Kidd,
and he had one on his first crossing.

594
00:42:54,116 --> 00:42:57,077
It's a mechanical decoy
about the size of an icebox,

595
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,204
and it shoots out gas
like an <i>Alka-Seltzer.</i>

596
00:42:59,288 --> 00:43:00,914
The krauts just drop it in the water,

597
00:43:00,998 --> 00:43:03,333
and it hangs there
while we waste depth charges on it.

598
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:05,669
Detail it in your after-action report.

599
00:43:05,752 --> 00:43:08,130
Make sure all the other operators
are familiar with it.

600
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:10,090
I... I should've caught it sooner, sir.

601
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,260
No, you did good work.
Thank you.

602
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:14,553
Sir. Aye, sir.

603
00:43:14,636 --> 00:43:16,471
You couldn't have known, Ernie.

604
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:22,019
Got 'em, sir.
Four men.

605
00:43:22,102 --> 00:43:23,942
- Only four?
- All they could see or hear, sir.

606
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:26,648
<i>Okay. Head to rear of convoy.
Right hard rudder, hard over.</i>

607
00:43:26,732 --> 00:43:27,774
All ahead two-thirds.

608
00:43:27,858 --> 00:43:30,068
Right hard rudder,
hard over. Aye, aye, sir.

609
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:35,115
<i>Rocket!
Distress rocket astern! Rear of convoy!</i>

610
00:43:37,743 --> 00:43:40,204
<i>All ahead flank. Meet her
when we're headed down the lane.</i>

611
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:42,080
All ahead flank.
Aye, aye, sir.

612
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:54,343
<i>That's the Southland, sir.
It's an American supply ship.</i>

613
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,450
Greyhound, Harry here.

614
00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:23,080
To confirm, targets remain at speed
just outside our perimeter.

615
00:44:23,747 --> 00:44:26,427
<i>Southland rescue completed.
Twenty-eight men rescued, sir.</i>

616
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,627
Radar is back up, Captain.

617
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:30,379
Left full rudder to 087.

618
00:44:30,462 --> 00:44:32,840
<i>Take us up the right side of the convoy.
All ahead standard.</i>

619
00:44:32,923 --> 00:44:34,683
All ahead standard.
Aye, aye, sir.

620
00:44:34,716 --> 00:44:36,677
Engine room answers
all ahead standard, sir.

621
00:44:40,264 --> 00:44:43,892
Greyhound. Greyhound, Greyhound.

622
00:44:43,976 --> 00:44:45,561
This is Gray Wolf.

623
00:44:46,478 --> 00:44:52,359
We hunt you and your friends
Eagle, Dicky and Harry.

624
00:44:53,652 --> 00:44:56,905
We watch your ships sinking into the deep.

625
00:44:57,656 --> 00:45:02,119
We hear the screams of your comrades
as they die.

626
00:45:03,412 --> 00:45:07,583
How many of them will there be
before you join them?

627
00:45:09,334 --> 00:45:13,755
The Gray Wolf is so very hungry.

628
00:45:15,299 --> 00:45:17,902
- Your women will learn of your dying...
- Greyhound to all escorts.

629
00:45:17,926 --> 00:45:21,138
- And weep into the long night before...
<i>Switch TBS traffic to channel Zebra.</i>

630
00:45:21,221 --> 00:45:24,391
- They turn to the arms of their lovers.
- Execute.

631
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:45,954
Eagle here.
Pips on the move.

632
00:45:46,038 --> 00:45:48,874
<i>One bearing 080,
range 11 miles and closing.</i>

633
00:45:48,957 --> 00:45:51,168
The other at 085, nine miles.

634
00:45:51,251 --> 00:45:52,377
That signal.

635
00:45:52,461 --> 00:45:54,004
Greyhound, Dicky.
Greyhound, Dicky.

636
00:45:54,087 --> 00:45:56,381
<i>Greyhound.
Our contact is now bearing 113.</i>

637
00:45:56,465 --> 00:45:59,134
<i>The other bears 101,
range two miles and approaching.</i>

638
00:45:59,218 --> 00:46:01,178
<i>Greyhound, Harry.
Our two pips are separated.</i>

639
00:46:01,261 --> 00:46:04,223
<i>Bearing 084 and 095. Both 8.5 miles.</i>

640
00:46:04,306 --> 00:46:06,099
Looks as if they're coming in for a scrum.

641
00:46:06,183 --> 00:46:08,393
Noted, thank you.
Greyhound out.

642
00:46:08,977 --> 00:46:10,979
Charlie, did you get the sighting reports?

643
00:46:11,063 --> 00:46:12,981
- Yes, sir.
- Here they come.

644
00:46:24,409 --> 00:46:28,497
<i>Greyhound, Dicky. They're attacking!
Bearing 276, range 1,500.</i>

645
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,791
<i>Target bearing 090,
coming across your bow.</i>

646
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:33,752
<i>Dicky, Greyhound.
I see tracer fire over on your side.</i>

647
00:46:33,836 --> 00:46:35,504
Are you engaging the target?

648
00:47:25,554 --> 00:47:28,015
<i>Status report.
No contacts at present.</i>

649
00:47:28,098 --> 00:47:30,767
<i>Known losses during the night,
five ships,</i>

650
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:35,105
<i>Vasco, Southland, Corning,
Paumbarten, Powell.</i>

651
00:47:35,189 --> 00:47:39,651
<i>Two ships damaged,
23 survivors, 210 confirmed dead.</i>

652
00:48:02,758 --> 00:48:05,844
<i>Greyhound, Eagle.
Target sighted. Engaging now.</i>

653
00:48:07,221 --> 00:48:10,015
<i>Eagle, Greyhound.
We will join you to assist.</i>

654
00:48:14,645 --> 00:48:15,771
- Mister Lopez.
- Aye, sir.

655
00:48:15,854 --> 00:48:18,649
- Our next pattern will be medium.
- Aye, aye, sir.

656
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:20,776
Lieutenant Fippler,
you better get up here.

657
00:48:20,859 --> 00:48:22,486
Right standard rudder to 210.

658
00:48:22,569 --> 00:48:25,280
<i>Right standard rudder to 210.</i>
Aye, aye, sir.

659
00:48:25,906 --> 00:48:27,115
- Mister Harbutt.
- Sir.

660
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:30,369
Keep apprised of Eagle's target bearing
and notify me when we're two miles out.

661
00:48:30,452 --> 00:48:31,453
Aye, aye, sir.

662
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:39,253
Sir, it's about the consumption
of depth charges.

663
00:48:39,336 --> 00:48:42,130
- Yes?
- Last pattern makes 32 cans fired.

664
00:48:44,925 --> 00:48:46,802
How many full patterns do we have left?

665
00:48:46,885 --> 00:48:48,011
None, sir.

666
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:50,514
We're down to six charges.

667
00:48:53,016 --> 00:48:56,687
We pulled everything from below
last watch, if you recall, sir.

668
00:48:59,064 --> 00:49:01,650
<i>Yes, yes, of course.
Thank you, Mister Flipper.</i>

669
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:03,652
It's Fippler, sir.

670
00:49:05,445 --> 00:49:09,157
Mister Fippler, we must leave off
the firing of full patterns.

671
00:49:09,616 --> 00:49:10,993
What I was gonna suggest, sir.

672
00:49:19,084 --> 00:49:23,172
"Wise as a serpent,
harmless as a dove."

673
00:49:28,135 --> 00:49:31,305
- Captain.
- I know it's risky, Charlie, but

674
00:49:31,388 --> 00:49:32,723
we need to break protocol.

675
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:36,518
<i>How soon can we reach air cover?
No more zigzags, no evasive maneuvers.</i>

676
00:49:36,602 --> 00:49:37,603
Aye, aye, sir.

677
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:53,368
Go, Charlie.

678
00:49:53,452 --> 00:49:55,704
We can be in range
of air cover in 24 hours.

679
00:49:55,787 --> 00:49:58,165
That's 0800
if we shift to a direct course, sir.

680
00:49:58,248 --> 00:49:59,248
Thanks, Charlie.

681
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,133
What happened to him?

682
00:50:08,842 --> 00:50:11,011
<i>Took a header.
Gave me something more to do.</i>

683
00:50:13,847 --> 00:50:15,933
- That for the captain?
- Yeah.

684
00:50:16,016 --> 00:50:19,019
Man hasn't had a bite to eat
or been off his feet since we left.

685
00:50:20,145 --> 00:50:23,232
<i>General quarters, general quarters.
All hands, man your battle stations.</i>

686
00:50:23,982 --> 00:50:26,022
<i>We're turning
to intercept at 16 knots, sir.</i>

687
00:50:26,068 --> 00:50:28,129
- We'll do our best to hammer him.
- Understood, Dicky.

688
00:50:28,153 --> 00:50:29,446
Keep him under by all means.

689
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:30,948
- Keep him under.
- Aye, sir.

690
00:50:32,533 --> 00:50:37,412
<i>Combat, Conn. Keep a sharp eye out
for surface radar bearing 170.</i>

691
00:50:37,496 --> 00:50:38,765
Sir, I have the deck
and the conn.

692
00:50:38,789 --> 00:50:41,083
- Very well.
- Mister Watson has the deck and the conn.

693
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:42,543
<i>Distant contact, bearing 160.</i>

694
00:50:42,626 --> 00:50:45,462
<i>Sonar reports distant contact,
bearing 160.</i>

695
00:50:45,546 --> 00:50:48,632
<i>Dicky, Greyhound.
The contact is now ten degrees to my port.</i>

696
00:50:48,715 --> 00:50:50,193
- Aye, sir.
- Aye, aye, sir.

697
00:50:50,217 --> 00:50:52,094
- Mister Lopez.
- Single charges, sir?

698
00:50:52,177 --> 00:50:53,387
Single charges, yes.

699
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:55,389
Sonar reports contact, bearing 160.

700
00:50:55,472 --> 00:50:57,057
Periscope, starboard bow!

701
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:58,642
All mounts, fire at will.

702
00:51:03,105 --> 00:51:05,291
- I've got it, Mister Watson.
- Captain has the conn.

703
00:51:05,315 --> 00:51:06,900
Right sharply, another ten degrees.

704
00:51:06,984 --> 00:51:08,944
<i>Right sharp,
ten degrees.</i> Aye, sir.

705
00:51:10,195 --> 00:51:11,488
<i>Contact bearing 156...</i>

706
00:51:11,572 --> 00:51:15,617
<i>Sonar reports contact, bearing 156,

707
00:51:15,701 --> 00:51:18,370

<i>Come on in, Dicky.
I'm turning to port to clear for you.</i>

710
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:27,045
Thank you, Greyhound.
Here we come.

711

All ahead flank.
All ahead flank. Aye, sir.

713
00:51:33,844 --> 00:51:35,095
Torpedo!

714
00:51:36,305 --> 00:51:38,390
Your training, son.
Bearing. Range.

715
00:51:38,473 --> 00:51:40,934
<i>Torpedo in the water.
Starboard beam. 400 yards, sir.</i>

716
00:51:41,018 --> 00:51:45,772
<i>Torpedoes! Bearing 210!
Range 300! There, sir! Two fish!</i>

717
00:51:55,824 --> 00:51:57,367
Hard right rudder!
Hard over!

718
00:52:00,329 --> 00:52:02,956
<i>Greyhound, Dicky.
I'm launching depth charges now.</i>

719
00:52:07,169 --> 00:52:10,214
<i>Understood, Dicky.
I am crossing your bow for my own attack.</i>

720
00:52:13,509 --> 00:52:15,219
<i>Underwater explosion.
Indications confused.</i>

721

<i>Sonar reports only hearing explosions.
Indications confused.</i>

722

<i>Right standard rudder to 110.</i>

<i>Contact inside minimum sonar range.</i>

729
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,949
<i>Contact inside

730
00:52:39,743 --> 00:52:42,371
<i>U-boat! Starboard stern!
Dicky forced him up!</i>

731
00:52:49,294 --> 00:52:51,421
<i>Looks damaged, sir.
Can't submerge.</i>

732
00:52:53,048 --> 00:52:54,883
Hard right rudder!
Hard over!

733
00:52:56,468 --> 00:52:59,054
<i>He's coming in close!
U-boat, starboard bow!</i>

734
00:53:07,229 --> 00:53:10,148
He's slipped in
under our guns, sir. We can't hit him!

735
00:53:24,162 --> 00:53:26,582
<i>Dicky's coming back in.
Portside ahead, sir.</i>

736
00:53:29,793 --> 00:53:31,420
Greyhound, Dicky.
I'm on him, sir.

737
00:53:32,796 --> 00:53:34,256
Give him hell, Dicky!

738
00:53:39,178 --> 00:53:42,014
<i>Left full rudder!
Loop around and help Dicky.</i>

739
00:53:49,938 --> 00:53:52,816
<i>Dicky here. He's pulling in too close!
He's alongside of us.</i>

740
00:54:01,909 --> 00:54:03,452
Take cover!

741
00:54:04,494 --> 00:54:05,495
On your feet.

742
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:07,098
Son of a bitch ricocheted off the surface.

743
00:54:07,122 --> 00:54:08,415
Man your posts.

744
00:54:08,498 --> 00:54:10,417
- Slow to one-third.
- My language, sir.

745
00:54:10,501 --> 00:54:12,544
Slow to one-third.
Aye, sir.

746
00:54:18,342 --> 00:54:21,720
- Dicky's in the line of fire!
- Veer off, Dicky, veer off.

747
00:54:23,555 --> 00:54:24,765
Hold your fire.

748
00:54:24,848 --> 00:54:26,367
- Left full rudder.
- Left full rudder.

749
00:54:26,391 --> 00:54:28,810
All mounts, local control,
stand by broadside to port.

750
00:54:28,894 --> 00:54:30,854
- Fire as they bear.
- Aye, sir.

751
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:37,945
Come on, clear.

752
00:54:38,028 --> 00:54:41,657
Get clear, Dicky. Clear!

753
00:54:52,209 --> 00:54:54,002
Corpsman! Corpsman!

754
00:54:54,711 --> 00:54:57,214
Dicky's clear!
All mounts, commence fire!

755
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,862
Get some water in there!

756
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:26,994
Dicky, Greyhound.
What is your damage?

757
00:55:27,077 --> 00:55:29,997
Greyhound, our guns couldn't depress
far enough to do any damage.

758
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:33,125
But, at 20 yards, the shells
went right through us without detonating.

759
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:34,209
Are you seaworthy?

760
00:55:34,293 --> 00:55:36,146
All three hits
were well above the waterline, sir.

761
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:38,439
We'll have our holes patched,
and we'll be back in the hunt.

762
00:55:38,463 --> 00:55:41,592
<i>Very good. Return to your
screening station at best speed.</i>

763
00:55:44,761 --> 00:55:46,638
<i>Direct hit on mount 43, sir.</i>

764
00:55:46,722 --> 00:55:49,516
<i>Damage Control reports fire,
abaft frame 24.</i>

765
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:53,020
There's no flooding below the waterline,
and the casualty count is coming, sir.

766
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:05,282
<i>Three severely wounded.</i>

767
00:56:05,365 --> 00:56:08,577
<i>Bonnor. Meyer.
Forbrick is in critical shape. Three dead.</i>

768
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:09,870
Who are the dead?

769
00:56:09,953 --> 00:56:13,290
<i>Pisani, gunner's mate, third class.
Marx, seaman, second.</i>

770
00:56:14,166 --> 00:56:15,501
<i>Cleveland, messmate.</i>

771
00:56:18,128 --> 00:56:22,424
<i>Took a hit at the portside 40-millimeter
gun tub, loading ammunition, sir.</i>

772
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:25,361
I've got no room for corpses
down below, sir.

773
00:56:25,385 --> 00:56:26,779
Not with the four we pulled from <i>Vasco.</i>

774
00:56:26,803 --> 00:56:29,556
I can arrange for a service
within the next ten minutes, sir.

775
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:32,559
Of course.
All hands.

776
00:56:32,643 --> 00:56:33,769
Aye, aye, Captain.

777
00:56:35,312 --> 00:56:36,313
Bill?

778
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:38,607
How bad was he hit?

779
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:39,690
Sir?

780
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:41,985
George Cleveland.

781
00:56:42,611 --> 00:56:45,030
Completely mutilated, sir.
All of them.

782
00:56:54,414 --> 00:56:57,251
"We therefore commit
the earthly remains of Anthony Pisani",

Now,
all hands, bury the dead.

796
00:57:40,711 --> 00:57:43,172
Now, all hands, bury the dead.

797

<i>Ship's company. Attention!</i>

798
00:57:54,766 --> 00:57:55,767
Salute!

<i>I am going to his aid, rear of the convoy.
Maintain your sweep. Go easy on your fuel.</i>

Mister Harbutt.
Sir.

817
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:47,546
That's Eagle and Cadena.

818
00:59:47,629 --> 00:59:49,464
Circle them at one mile
to cover the rescue.

819
00:59:49,548 --> 00:59:53,427
- Helm, left standard rudder. Come to 225.
- Left standard rudder...

820
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:56,054
Eagle, Greyhound.
What is your status?

821
00:59:56,847 --> 00:59:59,516
We were hit forward of the engine room
and have a fire below deck.

822
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,809
Some casualties.

823
01:00:01,435 --> 01:00:04,354
The Kong Gustav was hit first,
sank in three minutes.

824
01:00:04,438 --> 01:00:05,689
We saw no survivors.

825
01:00:06,523 --> 01:00:07,816
It's a bad afternoon, sir.

826
01:00:09,067 --> 01:00:10,152
How seaworthy are you?

827
01:00:11,445 --> 01:00:14,007
We have a five-degree list at starboard,
and we're down at the stern,

828
01:00:14,031 --> 01:00:16,074
but we'll tow all right up to five knots.

829
01:00:16,158 --> 01:00:18,911
We have a flap of plate sticking up,
scooping in the sea.

830
01:00:18,994 --> 01:00:21,163
The list gets worse if we make any speed.

831
01:00:22,414 --> 01:00:23,957
We must keep you afloat, Eagle.

832
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:26,460
We'll do all the sea allows, sir.

833
01:00:27,002 --> 01:00:29,671
Very well. Greyhound out.

834
01:00:57,241 --> 01:00:58,992
I'm ready to relieve you, sir.

835
01:00:59,076 --> 01:01:01,370
<i>Very well.
We're steady on course 225.</i>

836
01:01:01,453 --> 01:01:03,997
And we're at standard speed
with fuel conservation.

837
01:01:04,081 --> 01:01:05,582
I relieve you, sir.

838
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:09,461
Sir?

839
01:01:10,295 --> 01:01:13,215
<i>Sir, I stand relieved.
Mister Carling has the deck and the conn.</i>

840
01:01:13,715 --> 01:01:14,758
Very well.

841
01:01:15,342 --> 01:01:18,846
Mister Carling,
Cadena has Eagle under tow at four knots.

842
01:01:18,929 --> 01:01:21,974
<i>Continue circling.
We'll hold the screen at rear of convoy.</i>

843
01:01:22,724 --> 01:01:24,935
Sonar, standard sweep to starboard.

844
01:01:25,435 --> 01:01:27,771
<i>Sonar, Bridge.
Search to starboard, standard pattern.</i>

845
01:01:41,451 --> 01:01:43,996
Greyhound, Eagle.
Greyhound, Eagle.

846
01:01:49,042 --> 01:01:50,127
Greyhound.

847
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:52,379
<i>Request permission to abandon ship, sir.</i>

848
01:01:53,046 --> 01:01:55,090
The collision mats were not big enough.

849
01:01:55,174 --> 01:01:58,468
We have a 15-degree list now,
and the main deck is underwater.

850
01:01:59,094 --> 01:02:02,181
<i>Well, I'm sure you've done all you could.
Permission granted.</i>

851
01:02:02,764 --> 01:02:06,185
<i>She's been a good home, sir.
It's been an honor sailing with you.</i>

852
01:02:06,268 --> 01:02:08,437
<i>We'll be praying for you.
Godspeed, Captain.</i>

853
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,689
Thank you for a job well done.

854
01:02:32,503 --> 01:02:33,587
Thank you, Cleveland.

855
01:02:34,546 --> 01:02:35,631
I'm Pitts, sir.

856
01:02:36,632 --> 01:02:38,592
- Thank you.
- Sir.

857
01:02:52,814 --> 01:02:54,191
I need Mister Cole.

858
01:02:57,653 --> 01:03:00,364
<i>XO requested, bridge.
XO requested, bridge.</i>

859
01:03:04,535 --> 01:03:05,869
You wanted to see me, skip?

860
01:03:16,672 --> 01:03:18,090
I've lost Eagle.

861
01:03:18,173 --> 01:03:22,636
Harry and Dicky are low on depth charges
and fuel, as are we.

862
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:25,764
I can offer only scant protection
to the convoy.

863
01:03:26,723 --> 01:03:28,350
We need air cover, Charlie.

864
01:03:30,227 --> 01:03:31,228
Do...

865
01:03:37,484 --> 01:03:41,154
Do I break radio silence
with a message to the Admiralty?

866
01:03:41,238 --> 01:03:44,449
Or does that let the wolf pack know
just how vulnerable we are?

867
01:03:44,533 --> 01:03:45,909
What would the message be?

868
01:03:48,245 --> 01:03:49,329
"Help needed urgently."

869
01:03:50,163 --> 01:03:52,165
No. "Help needed."
That means "urgently."

870
01:03:52,833 --> 01:03:55,043
"Needed" isn't needed.
Just "help."

871
01:03:55,127 --> 01:03:58,172
That's all the Admiralty needs to hear
for a modified rendezvous point.

872
01:03:58,255 --> 01:04:00,424
The Germans might miss a message
as short as that.

873
01:04:01,091 --> 01:04:04,678
I wouldn't need to take this risk
if I'd been smarter yesterday.

874
01:04:05,345 --> 01:04:07,723
What you did yesterday got us to today.

875
01:04:07,806 --> 01:04:11,602
<i>It's not enough, Charlie.
Not nearly enough.</i>

876
01:04:25,157 --> 01:04:26,575
Message from the Admiralty, sir.

877
01:04:27,367 --> 01:04:30,120
<i>Some of it's badly scrambled, sir.
I've done my best with it.</i>

878
01:04:32,247 --> 01:04:33,874
- XO to the bridge.
- Aye, aye, sir.

879
01:04:35,667 --> 01:04:36,710
What are these scrambles?

880
01:04:36,793 --> 01:04:39,838
<i>I think coded numerals, sir.
But I'm sure of that.</i>

881
01:04:40,839 --> 01:04:42,508
"Expect aircraft.

882
01:04:42,591 --> 01:04:45,177
<i>His challenge, 'Uncle William.'
Your answer, 'Baker Dog.'"</i>

883
01:04:46,595 --> 01:04:47,596
Captain?

884
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:49,806
Charlie. Message from Admiralty.

885
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:51,600
Reinforcements dispatched.

886
01:04:53,185 --> 01:04:54,728
But it's only partially deciphered.

887
01:04:54,811 --> 01:04:56,331
Put together a team,
see what else is there.

888
01:04:56,355 --> 01:04:57,356
Aye, aye, sir.

889
01:05:17,668 --> 01:05:19,127
<i>Greyhound!</i>

890
01:05:20,712 --> 01:05:23,715
Your flock is not safe from this wolf.

891
01:05:24,967 --> 01:05:28,262
We can always find you
in the night to kill you.

892
01:05:28,345 --> 01:05:29,346
Escorts, Greyhound.

893
01:05:29,429 --> 01:05:31,991
- Or will Dicky die next? Or Harry?
- Divert all further TBS traffic

894
01:05:32,015 --> 01:05:33,475
to channel Hotel. Execute.

895
01:05:35,394 --> 01:05:37,729
Thought these were numerals,
but it was "Point X-ray."

896
01:05:37,813 --> 01:05:39,940
"Modify rendezvous point to Point X-ray."

897
01:05:40,023 --> 01:05:42,609
- Mm-hmm. How soon?
- Something like four hours, skip.

898
01:05:44,069 --> 01:05:45,070
Sir.

899
01:06:19,813 --> 01:06:21,356
Messenger.
Yes, sir.

900
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,277
Go to my cabin and bring me my slippers.

901
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:26,361
Aye, sir.

902
01:06:45,672 --> 01:06:47,758
Ah, thank you.
Return those.

903
01:06:58,602 --> 01:06:59,603
Ah.

904
01:07:02,689 --> 01:07:04,691
<i>I've got two contacts
bearing 099...</i>

905
01:07:04,775 --> 01:07:07,402
<i>Combat reports two pips,
starboard bow. Bearing 099.</i>

906
01:07:07,486 --> 01:07:08,862
<i>The other at 168, sir.</i>

907
01:07:08,946 --> 01:07:11,323
- Boatswain, take us to white.
- Aye, aye, sir.

908
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:14,785
Charlie, these pips.

909
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:17,996
Yes, sir, we got two skunks
showing on surface radar.

910
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,540
They're heading straight for us.

911
01:07:19,623 --> 01:07:22,501
Just two hours to the rendezvous point,
Ernie, God willin'.

912
01:07:25,546 --> 01:07:30,759
<i>All escorts, Greyhound. I have
two surface targets off to starboard.</i>

913
01:07:30,843 --> 01:07:32,511
Maintain your screens.

914
01:07:33,679 --> 01:07:35,931
Mister Watson,
bring us up to general quarters.

915
01:07:36,014 --> 01:07:38,433
- General quarters.
- Aye, aye, sir.

916
01:07:38,517 --> 01:07:41,246
<i>General quarters, general quarters.
All hands, man your battle stations.</i>

917
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:43,897
<i>Harry, Dicky. Greyhound.
I am engaging targets.</i>

918
01:07:43,981 --> 01:07:46,501
<i>Request permission to come down
there and bounce 'em with you, sir.</i>

919
01:07:46,525 --> 01:07:48,861
- Negative, Dicky. Maintain your screen.
- Aye, sir.

920
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,030
- Messenger.
- Sir.

921
01:07:54,032 --> 01:07:55,367
I'd like more coffee, please.

922
01:07:56,201 --> 01:07:57,286
Aye, sir.

923
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:07,838
Greyhound.

924
01:08:08,547 --> 01:08:10,549
Guten Morgen, Greyhound.

925
01:08:11,717 --> 01:08:15,429
Did you think you had slipped away
from this Gray Wolf?

926
01:08:15,512 --> 01:08:19,765
No, you did not.
You will not.

927
01:08:20,684 --> 01:08:24,770
The sea favors the Gray Wolf on the hunt,

928
01:08:24,854 --> 01:08:27,399
not the hound on the run.

929
01:08:27,983 --> 01:08:31,819
You and your comrades will die today.

930
01:08:32,404 --> 01:08:33,404
<i>Conn, Combat.</i>

954
01:11:27,955 --> 01:11:29,206
We must have hit her!

<i>Charlie! Lay a course to open the arcs

<i>Yes, sir. Dicky and I fought him
out on the surface, and we got him.</i>

996
01:15:20,187 --> 01:15:22,564
Uh, my escort group sank three others.

997
01:15:22,648 --> 01:15:25,859
<i>Four U-boats?
Bloody good job, Greyhound.</i>

998
01:15:27,611 --> 01:15:31,031
We will be relieving you now
and taking the convoy on to Liverpool.

999
01:15:31,114 --> 01:15:32,449
You take Dicky and Harry

1000
01:15:32,533 --> 01:15:34,826
and make best speed
to the naval yard in Londonderry.

1001
01:15:36,662 --> 01:15:41,834
<i>Sir, I request I stay with the convoy.
I have 56 hours fuel at economical speed.</i>

1002
01:15:42,501 --> 01:15:45,838
<i>No, that's an order, Commander.
We'll see the convoy on from here.</i>

1003
01:15:45,921 --> 01:15:47,840
I need you to take Dicky and Harry
back home.

1004
01:15:47,923 --> 01:15:51,051
They're not fit to stay in the game,
understood? Off to Derry with you.

1005
01:15:51,134 --> 01:15:52,135
Aye, aye, sir.

1006
01:15:52,803 --> 01:15:55,472
Tell me, Greyhound,
just curious,

1007
01:15:55,556 --> 01:15:57,683
how many crossings
does that make for you now?

1008
01:15:58,684 --> 01:16:00,269
This was my first, sir.

1009
01:16:00,352 --> 01:16:02,437
Unbelievable.

1010
01:16:02,521 --> 01:16:05,691
<i>Well, let's hope next time's a bit easier,
eh? Admirable show, Commander.</i>

1011
01:16:05,774 --> 01:16:06,900
Thank you, sir.

1012
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:23,458
Dicky, Harry. Greyhound.

1013
01:16:23,542 --> 01:16:25,043
- Dicky here.
- Harry here.

1014
01:16:25,127 --> 01:16:26,962
You are relieved of your screening duties.

1015
01:16:27,045 --> 01:16:30,007
<i>Form starboard echelon on me
at the head of the convoy.</i>

1016
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:33,510
<i>We will depart on 087 for Londonderry.</i>

1017
01:16:33,594 --> 01:16:35,012
Aye, aye, sir.

1018
01:16:35,095 --> 01:16:36,138
Aye, sir.

1019
01:16:58,285 --> 01:16:59,453
<i>Messenger.</i>

1020
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:02,164
<i>- Messenger.</i>
- Sir.

1021
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:07,544
<i>Signal Bridge. Send it.
Signal Bridge. Aye, sir.</i>

1022
01:17:07,628 --> 01:17:10,297
<i>Commodore is signaling
five minutes to course change, Captain.</i>

1023
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:12,549
Very well.
Take us up the lane.

1024
01:17:12,633 --> 01:17:14,968
<i>When we clear the lead ships,
turn right to 087.</i>

1025
01:17:15,052 --> 01:17:17,095
- Dodge, James, starboard echelon.
- Aye, aye, sir.

1026
01:17:17,179 --> 01:17:19,348
<i>Steady on 087. Starboard echelon.</i>

1027
01:17:19,431 --> 01:17:22,059
- Helm, mark your head.
<i>- Mark 083, sir.</i>

1028
01:17:22,142 --> 01:17:23,685
Very well.
Keep her so.

1029
01:17:23,769 --> 01:17:25,479
Steady as I go.
Aye, sir.

1030
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:45,582
Mister Carling, she's all yours.

1031
01:17:47,584 --> 01:17:49,211
I will be in my cabin if you need me.

1032
01:17:50,379 --> 01:17:51,380
Aye, aye, sir.

1033
01:20:32,332 --> 01:20:34,710
"I thank you,
my heavenly Father,

1034
01:20:34,793 --> 01:20:36,670
that you have graciously kept me this day.

1035
01:20:36,753 --> 01:20:40,340
Into your hands I commend myself,
my body and soul. Amen."
