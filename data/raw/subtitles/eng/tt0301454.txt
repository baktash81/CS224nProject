1
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,700
Hmm.

2
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,200
Mm-hmm.

3
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,800
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

4
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,300
A-ha.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,300
Wowsers, it's quiet.

6
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,400
Too quiet.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,100
And when it's this quiet...

8
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,600
You know what that means, Brain?

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,400
Evil's afoot.   

10
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,000
We're on a stakeout, GADGET-MOBILE!

11
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,500
No, you're on a stakeout. I'm on a sleep-in.

12
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,800
So keep it down, alright?

13
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,100
The least you could do is stay alert.

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,400
Alert for what? Face it. Inspector G...

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,600
since we locked up Claw, all the bad guys have been...

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,900
too afraid to show their faces in Riverton.

17
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,600
One thing I've learned in all my years...

18
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,900
of crime fighting, GADGET-MOBILE...

19
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,500
is that it's always the most quiet...

20
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:22,400
right before the criminal strike!

21
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,200
And speaking of crime...

22
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,200
Potential law-breaker at 12 o'clock!

23
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,500
Who? Grandma over there?

24
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,000
Oops! There go those glitches again.

25
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:56,800
Ah.. The speed limit is clearly posted
at 25 miles per hour...

26
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:02,900
But, she's going at exactly 25.3 miles per hour.

27
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,900
Prepare for high-speed chase!

28
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:15,200
Hang onto your pockets,
'cause here come the rockets.

29
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,200
Oh, my!

30
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,700
Stop in the name of the ....

31
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,400
Law.

32
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,700
That went well.

33
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,300
GADGET-MOBILE : Whoa. Now.
How is that for disc brakes?

34
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,800
, Back in the thing!

35
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,800
Oh...

36
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,300
Ahem.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Ma'am, do you know that drag racing...

38
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,600
on public roads is illegal?

39
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,800
But, officer, I ...

40
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,400
GADGET: There are no buts
when it comes to the law.

41
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,600
I'm afraid I'm gonna need
to see your driver's license.

42
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,200
I'm sorry, Officer.
I must've left it at home.

43
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,000
Yeah, A likely story.

44
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,200
Aah! You have the right to remain ... silent!

45
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,800
If you give up ... Coming through ...

46
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,900
that's right ... Unh! 

47
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,100
My man really needs to switch to decaf.

48
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,600
GADGET-MOBILE : OK. One sweet granny...

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,300
packaged and ready for delivery.

50
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,500
Drag racing indeed.

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,500
I've seen your type before.

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,600
You've got a need for speed.

53
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,900
Yeah..I know.

54
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,700
Uncle Gadget!
Hi, Brain!

55
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,900
Penny,I thought we agreed
you'd call me "Inspector"...

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,100
in front of the hardened criminals.

57
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,200
She's a hardened criminal?

58
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,900
Don't be fooled by appearances, Penny.

59
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,800
Look what I found in her purse.

60
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,800
Probably from one of her victims.

61
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,000
And look at this.

62
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,300
Liquid evil.

63
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,900
But, but, officer ...

64
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,800
Save it for the judge, perp.

65
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,400
Yeah, but, but, but.

66
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,100
Everybody's got a big but.

67
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Hey! What are you doing here?
Isn't today a school day?

68
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,800
Well, there aren't any good
cases to solve at school.

69
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,200
I want to solve real cases with you.

70
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,500
Penny, I told you before...

71
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,900
you're too young to be chasing criminals.

72
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,200
You should be in school.

73
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,200
But, uncle Gadget, if you'd just
give me a chance, I ...

74
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,500
Look, I have to go.

75
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,200
I'm in the middle of a big arrest.

76
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,600
Now you get back to school...

77
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,400
and I'll see you tonight.

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And you, I hope you like prison food.

79
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,000
Mm, mm, mm.

80
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,300
BAXTER : Now. Let's see how
your physiobiometric...

81
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,500
febble fitzer is functioning.

82
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,500
Oh ... Diagnostics check out fine.

83
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,600
What seems to be the problem, Gadget?

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,900
Baxter. I'm still having gadgets
with my glitches.

85
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,000
I mean ... glitches with my glitches

86
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,500
I'm all messed up.

87
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:54,100
Sorry, Gadget, I don't see
what the problem is.

88
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,700
Watch.

89
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,600
GADGET : See? Bubble Gum...

90
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,400
I see what the problem is.

91
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,900
Isn't there something you can
do for me, Baxter?

92
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:18,000
Ah ... you're the prototype gadget, Gadget.

93
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,600
There's bound to be a few glitches.

94
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,000
But you'll be happy to know
we've been working on it.

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,300
I'll let you in on a little secret.

96
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,800
Soon, we'll be on therein something ...

97
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:39,700
Soon...that'll solve all base
glitches for good ... soon.

98
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:43,300
Wowsers. Thanks, Baxter.

99
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,000
Well, better go check in with the chief.

100
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,500
Ooh ... I wouldn't bother
the chief right now.

101
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,100
I heard some idiot arrested
his mother this afternoon.

102
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,300
CHIEF : Where is he?

103
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,900
Gadget!

104
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,400
BAXTER : Oh ...

105
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,800
You put my mother in jail
for drag racing?

106
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,500
And driving without a license.

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,800
You've always said, Chief,
no one is above the law.

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,400
This is what you also said
last week when you arrested...

109
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,700
that troop of Girl Rangers
for selling cookies!

110
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:20,900
Those cookies were three days
past expiration date!

111
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,500
CHIEF : Ugh ... What ... Ugh.

112
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,700
You are this close to being
put on probation, Gadget.

113
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,300
Now, let's get my mother out.

114
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,800
Heaven knows what's happening to her down
there with all those low lifes.

115
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,500
And then, when his guard is down,
his kidneys are exposed...

116
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:43,800
and that's when the marathon of pain begins.

117
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,100
-Oh! 
-Who's your grandma now?

118
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,000
Take some of this! How'd you like this?

119
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,000
GADGET : Wowsers, that's gotta hurt.

120
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,900
Unh!

121
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,000
Mom's tough love.

122
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,000
This is your last warning, Gadget.

123
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,900
Stick to solving real crimes.

124
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,500
Chief, there are no real criminals yet
in the Riverton Prison.

125
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,800
[Ring Ring]

126
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,300
Gadget here.

127
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,000
What?

128
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,500
Ah ... Ha ...

129
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,500
Wowsers!

130
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,900
You'll never guess what happened.

131
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,100
Claw escaped!

132
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,800
Claw escaped?

133
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,800
Police have put out an all-points bulletin ...

134
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,200
and are setting up a dragnet ...

135
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,300
in hopes of finding the fugitive.

136
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,400
Citizens are advised that if they see ...

137
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,700
an evil genius with a claw not to approach him.

138
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,100
Dial 911 immediately.

139
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,500
He's extremely dangerous and really, really mean.

140
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,700
And I'm on the case. Bye-bye, Penny!

141
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,300
PENNY : Wait, Uncle Gadget!

142
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,800
You've got let me come with you. I mean ...
I can help look for clues--

143
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,600
I told you before, Penny, you're too young.

144
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,600
How old do you have to be to be a detective?

145
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,400
I don't know.

146
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,600
But older than you are now.

147
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,600
Look...

148
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,300
I've got work to do. I'll see you tomorrow.

149
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,800
Don't forget to brush your teeth.

150
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:38,400
I could do so well ...
if he would just give me a chance.

151
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,800
My finely honed instincts are telling me...

152
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,400
that he probably escaped through here.

153
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,800
Oh, really?

154
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,800
Gadget, take a look at this.

155
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,200
We found this in Claw's cell.

156
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,900
Wowsers. You don't think he's still
holding a grudge, do you?

157
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,600
Gadget, listen.

158
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,200
The whole city is counting on you.

159
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,800
Go out there and catch Claw.

160
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,900
Oh, I'll catch him.

161
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,600
Caught him before, catch him again.

162
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,100
Don't worry, Chief.

163
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,200
I'll have Claw back behind bars
before you can say ...

164
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:14,700
CHIEF : Gadget ..... Ooh!

165
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,300
CLAW : Brick, retrieve my darts!

166
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,500
Huh? Ooh!

167
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,200
McKible, serve my tea!

168
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,800
McKIBLE : I don't see why we gotta...

169
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,200
retrieve your darts and serve your tea.

170
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,100
Yeah!

171
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,500
We're vicious minions, not vallet. 

172
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,800
Ah ..... ! OooOH!

173
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,800
Heh Heh Heh. One sugar or two?

174
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,900
Two.

175
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,900
Here, boss.

176
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,900
BRICK : Dr. Claw, This place is a dumb!
What happened to your multimillion-dollar...

177
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,800
high-rise evil headquarters?

178
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,200
What do you think happened to it?

179
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,200
Aah!

180
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,400
CLAW : When Gadget arrested me ...

181
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,900
the police confiscated all my assets.

182
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,900
But after we've pulled off
the crime of the century ...

183
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,600
I'll be back on top again.

184
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:18,500
Great ... another crime of the century.

185
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,100
I'm still on parole for the last one.

186
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,700
What's the plan this time?

187
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,900
Watch and see.

188
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,500
NEWS ANCHOR : The Federal Reserve Bank ...

189
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,000
with a deposit of over five trillion dollars ...

190
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,400
in pure gold was built two years ago ...

191
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,400
after Riverton was declared statistically ...

192
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,700
the safest city in America.

193
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,200
Utilizing the latest in security technology ...

194
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,500
and a squadron of armed guards ...

195
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,300
the bank is considered impregnable.

196
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,900
 <br>CLAW : Not
CLAW : Not for long.

197
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,700
BRICK : We're gonna rob the Federal Reserve!

198
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,000
CLAW : Right before Riverton's eyes ...

199
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,800
and there won't be a thing
Inspector Gadget can do about it.

200
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:58,600
How we can do that? They said the bank was impen--

201
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,000
Really hard to get into.

202
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah, I don't see how.

203
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,200
That's why you're just minions,
and I'm an evil genius.

204
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,800
He's got a point.
Yeah.

205
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:14,600
We are going to build the ultimate super weapon.

206
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,100
But we haven't much time.

207
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,500
We need to be ready in 10 days ...

208
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:23,200
because next Thursday at exactly 9:23 A.M.

209
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:27,200
the X-Force One satellite will be
directly over Riverton.

210
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,500
And by then, We need to steal ...

211
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,800
ion fuel cells.
A protoid laser ...

212
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,000
and a ruby...

213
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,300
plus a few miscellaneous knick knacks.

214
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:43,800
BRICK : Yum. I love knick knacks.

215
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,100
Any news on Claw's escape?

216
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,200
The city's in a panic!

217
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,500
The people want to know.

218
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,900
What are you doing to capture Claw?

219
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,600
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a momentous day for us.

220
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,200
OFFICER : Huh?

221
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,900
MAYOR : The Gadget program has helped make Riverton ...

222
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,600
OFFICER : Thanks a lot. Hmph!

223
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,800
... the safest city in America!

224
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Bob!

225
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,900
Thank you, Mayor.

226
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,900
We weren't going to unveil this until next year ...

227
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,400
but in light of Claw's escape ...

228
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,700
we decided to move up our timetable.

229
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,500
CHIEF : Baxter..

230
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,600
This is Gadget Model 2 ...

231
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,200
or "G2" for short.

232
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:38,200
The latest, most newest generation ...

233
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,400
in the Gadget program.

234
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,600
G2 reporting for duty.

235
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,900
Sir!

236
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,800
Wowsers.

237
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,700
BAXTER : She's similar to the original Gadget...

238
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:22,500
But she's completely, entirely all robot.

239
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Not to worry, G2...

240
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,400
I've got everything under control.

241
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,400
Oh, Inspector, you're everything ...

242
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,500
I ever wanted in a crime fighter.

243
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,800
Mmm.

244
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,100
CHIEF : Gadget! Gadget!

245
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,800
Gadget, could you give me a hand, please?

246
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,800
Certainly, Chief.

247
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,500
I want to give a little demonstration
of what G2 can do.

248
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,100
Pleasure to meet you, Miss ... 2.

249
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,700
G2 : Hmm.

250
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,100
Must be a loose wire something else.

251
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:13,100
I'll speak to Baxter ... about that.

252
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:18,500
G2 will now show us how
she would apprehend the suspect.

253
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:24,100
Gadget, I want you to take this stolen money ...

254
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,900
and hide it on your person.

255
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,200
Stolen money!

256
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,300
Stop this felonious and unlawful act ...

257
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,700
or I shall have to use force.

258
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,800
Well, she has got a very commanding voice.

259
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,600
COMPUTER VOICE : Alert! Suspect! Suspect!

260
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,500
Very well. You were warned.

261
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,000
Whoa! ... Whoa!

262
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,100
Oh!

263
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,300
Unh! Huh.

264
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,400
You have the right to remain silent.

265
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,700
If you give up this right, anything you say ...

266
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,300
can and will be held against you.

267
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,000
All right, G2, I think we get the picture.

268
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,600
MAYOR : Bravo! Bravo!

269
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,500
Thank you, Ladies and Gentlemen ... 

270
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,200
GADGET : Well ... she is very good.

271
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,700
That's one of the many improvements
I've made to G2.0.

272
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,500
Like it?

273
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:36,000
You might say that G2 is you without the glitches.

274
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,900
I'm putting her on the Claw case right away.

275
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,700
Fantastic! I always wanted a partner.

276
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,300
And when we interrogate criminals ...

277
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,700
I'll play good Gadget, and you can play bad Gadget.

278
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,700
I don't think so.

279
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,100
OK, then you play good Gadget, and I'll be bad Gadget.

280
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,100
I appreciate the ofference, Inspector ...

281
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,000
but I work ... alone.

282
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,700
But, chief had cloaked my case.

283
00:16:57,900 --> 00:33:55,300
You can go back to cracking
speeders on the highway, Gadget.

284
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,700
There's a new sheriff in town.

285
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,300
Hmm?

286
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,800
PENNY : Uncle Gadget? Uncle Gadget!
Is this true they're giving the Claw
case to this G2 character?

287
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,000
Well ... for the time being,
but don't worry, Penny...

288
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,500
I'm being reassigned to another high-profile case.

289
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,600
What could be more high-profile than Claw?

290
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,700
Oh ... it's a top secret, Penny.

291
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:27,800
That's so top secret that they
haven't even told me yet, huh?

292
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,800
PENNY : Hmm.

293
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,500
So, what are you making there?

294
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,500
I'm just making your favorite dessert.

295
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,900
Apple crumb cake with raisin cinnamon icing...

296
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,400
and coconut sprinkles?

297
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,400
OK, I'm making your second favorite dessert...

298
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,800
Lemon pudding.

299
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:49,100
So, ah ... since from case we guess,
you wouldn't want to see this clue
that I found about Claw.

300
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,100
Clue claw? I mean ... a Claw clue?

301
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,800
Is it a clue about Claw?

302
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,100
Take a look at today's classifieds.

303
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,500
"Wanted"...

304
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,400
"Apply 7 P.M. tonight."

305
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,100
"Call 555-0139 for appointment."

306
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,900
I've already got a job, Penny, but thanks.

307
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,800
No, I checked the number...

308
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,000
and it's for a bar called "The Blue Monkey."

309
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,300
You know what this means right?

310
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,600
Hmm.

311
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,000
Uncle Gadget, if you go to The Blue Monkey...

312
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,000
I bet it will lead you right to Claw.

313
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,700
You can get back on the case and get a jump on G2.

314
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,600
You know, Penny, if I went to The Blue Monkey...

315
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,100
it might just lead me to Claw.

316
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,300
Then, I could get back on the case
and get the jump on G2.

317
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,500
That's what I was just saying.

318
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,800
Oh ... did you? I guess great minds think alike.

319
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,000
So, we'll make it right afternoon, right?

320
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,000
No. Nope. I'm sorry, Penny...

321
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,400
but this is official police business only.

322
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,400
You gotta let me come with you. I mean I can help you.

323
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,000
Penny, this is no place for a kid.

324
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:52,600
I'm not just a kid, Uncle Gadget!

325
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,900
Of course not. You're a very special kid.

326
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,900
But there's more to being a detective
than just being smart.

327
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,500
It takes a sharp eye...

328
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,600
for every detail, every little nuance.

329
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
A good detective never lets anything get ...

330
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,200
Uncle Gadget, the pudding!

331
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,900
OK! Heh Heh Heh.

332
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,400
Everything's fine!

333
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,700
Ugh.

334
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,900
It's a good thing I wore an apron.

335
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,000
GADGET-MOBILE : OK. Here we are.

336
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,500
GADGET : Wish me luck. I'm going under cover..

337
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,800
Hi, there, fellas.

338
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,000
Unh.

339
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,100
PENNY : OK. Brain. the coast is clear.

340
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,100
Come on, that's from deck.

341
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,100
What do you want?

342
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,300
Well, I just got out of the slammer.

343
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,900
and I'm looking to wet my whistle.

344
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,900
What'll you have?

345
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,300
A nice tall glass of milk.

346
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,600
milk?

347
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:20,200
I mean, chocolate milk!

348
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,900
Make it a double.

349
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,200
PENNY : Hey. Brain. This way.

350
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,100
McKIBLE : OK. then.

351
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:37,100
Let's see what applicants we have here.

352
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:42,900
Squint. Jungle Bob.

353
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:46,200
And you must be the one they call "The Ninja".

354
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,100
BRICK : "Ninja"? Why do they call you that?

355
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,800
Hyah!

356
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,000
I think I see why now.

357
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,000
OK, then.

358
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:04,300
Judging by this, you guys
are prime minion material.

359
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,900
Hoo!

360
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:29,300
I have a history of hair loss in my family.

361
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,900
Anything else I can get you?

362
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,800
Yes.

363
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,700
I'm looking for ...

364
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,900
Sorry, we don't serve lobster here.

365
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,600
What? No.

366
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,500
Dr. Claw.

367
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,700
Claw, huh?

368
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,300
Well, if you want to find him...

369
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,400
you're gonna have to grease a few palms...

370
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,900
If you get my drift.

371
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,500
Well, whatever you say.

372
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,400
Here you go..

373
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,200
top grade axle grease.

374
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,900
Why, you...

375
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,500
Aah!

376
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,600
Whoa!

377
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,500
Check, please.

378
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,700
Just the check.

379
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,000
So...

380
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,500
When do we start working for Dr.Claw?

381
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,000
McKIBLE : Immediately.

382
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,400
Did you hear that, Brain?

383
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:48,300
GADGET : Aah! Come on, guys!
Let's talk about it.

384
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,300
Oh, man. Aah!

385
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,000
You're stretching my sweater.

386
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,700
Help, GADGET-MOBILE!

387
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,700
Help! Ooh!

388
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,400
The cops! Come on, this way!

389
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,400
Let's get out of here quick!
Move it! Move it! Move it!

390
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,400
BRICK : We can hide at my mom's house.

391
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,500
PENNY : That was close.

392
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,500
GADGET : Ooh, I can see you're upset.

393
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:23,000
BARTENDER : Hey, look, I'm knocking his block off!

394
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,700
Mom ...

395
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,500
Coo-coo. Coo-coo.

396
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,500
Coo-coo.

397
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,200
Stop this felonious and unlawful act...

398
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,100
or I shall have to use force.

399
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:41,700
Look, boys, Malibu Barbie here is
gonna get rough with us.

400
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,600
G2 : Very well. You were warned.

401
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,700
Wowsers, she's good.

402
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,000
GADGET-MOBILE : Man ... lucky for them.
I wasn't in there.

403
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,900
'cause, I would have been on them
like ugly on a mini-van.

404
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,100
GADGET : Well ... thanks for the backup, G2...

405
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,400
although everything was under control.

406
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,500
I had those toughs right where I wanted them.

407
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,700
Inspector, what were you doing in
that bar dressed as...

408
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:23,800
What exactly are you supposed
to be dressed as?

409
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,300
I'm a hooligan. Huh?

410
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,700
When I'm under cover to follow up
on a valuable lead...

411
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,900
concerning Where's claw abouts ...

412
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,500
I mean, Claw's where abouts.

413
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,200
I'm in charge of the Crime Investigation
now, remember?

414
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:42,400
GADGET : Look, G2, maybe we've just thought of
got off on the wrong foot. Ooh!

415
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,100
Oh.

416
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,400
Perhaps we could have dinner sometime ... 

417
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,000
You know? just to discuss crime fighting strategies.

418
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,400
Imagine how great we could be as a team.

419
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,100
We could call ourselves "The G-Force"...

420
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,200
or "The G-Team" or "The 2 Gs".

421
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,100
Inspector Gadget! 
Gadget : What's up, G?

422
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,300
Even though I'm not programmed for such emotions...

423
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,500
I admit I find you strangely ... likable.

424
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,100
Hmm. 
Gadget 2 : But,

425
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,700
as I already told you, I work alone.

426
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,000
And so do l.

427
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,200
I'm just saying that maybe
we could work alone together.

428
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,700
PENNY : You don't even know who I am.

429
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,100
Think about it.

430
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,400
No, really. You can't arrest me.

431
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,500
I'm one of the good guys. Really, I am.

432
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,500
Hold on. She's with me.

433
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,400
Penny! What are you doing here?
Didn't I tell you to stay home?

434
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,400
Oh! Never mind that.
Look what I found about Claw.

435
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:33,000
McKIBLE : Dr. Claw's pulling a little
heist tomorrow night...

436
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:36,000
at the Concentrated Industries Warehouse.

437
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,700
Wowsers! We'll have to have a stakeout.
Gadget 2 : You mean, I'll have to have a stakeout.

438
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,900
Penny : Hey! This is our case, lady.

439
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,700
Penny.

440
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,200
I know. You told me to stay out of it...

441
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,200
but Look I did find you this clue.

442
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,200
Look! Penny, I know you want to be a detective.

443
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,900
OK. But this following me around all the time...

444
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,800
just isn't going to fly.

445
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,600
Oh!

446
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,600
Uh...

447
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,100
Gadget!

448
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,900
Hi, Chief.

449
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:10,500
Gadget ... what are you doing
in a barroom brawl?

450
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,300
Looking for Clue claws.

451
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,500
Claw clues .. clue about Claw.

452
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,900
And I was right. We got a valuable lead.

453
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,400
Yeah, a very valuable lead.

454
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,700
We have evidence of a possible heist 
at Concentrated Industries Warehouse
tomorrow night.

455
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,000
Great work, G2!

456
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,700
You can stake it out and catch him red-handed.

457
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,200
GADGET : Fantastic. I'll bring the doughnuts.

458
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,200
I already told you. You're off this case.

459
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,500
Both you and Nancy Drew here.

460
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,300
Hey! Pbbt!

461
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:41,500
And you're off the force, too, if you get
within as a hundred yards of that stakeout.

462
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:46,200
Alrigt fine, but if Claw gets away with his
plan for world domination. Don't come and cry on us.

463
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Remember, Gadget ... 100 yards!

464
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:52,300
GADGET : 99, 100 ...

465
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:56,200
101 yards away.

466
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,600
I'm at the stakeout...

467
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,400
but I haven't violated the chief's orders.

468
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,000
See? At the stakeout...

469
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,500
not at the stakeout.

470
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,600
Stakeout ... not at the stakeout.

471
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,900
I don't think the chief will see it that way.

472
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:21,400
My! she certainly is well-equipped, isn't she?

473
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,500
GADGET-MOBILE : Ooh, Gadget's got a girl friend.
Ooh, Gadget's got a girl friend.

474
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,100
Don't be silly, GADGET-MOBILE.

475
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,800
Our relationship is strictly professional.

476
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,700
Besides, she's state of the art.

477
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,800
I'm last year's model.

478
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,300
A few extra miles look good on a player....

479
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,900
and you are a player, G.

480
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,500
You're tricked out with more
extras than the Batmobile.

481
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,500
Just show her that it's all good
under the hood, alright?

482
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,900
I have no idea what you just said...

483
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,000
but I'm sure that if I were a car...

484
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,500
it would have been very helpful.

485
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,400
All I'm saying is, you got to show her...

486
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,100
you got what it takes, man.

487
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,000
You're right. You're right!

488
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,600
Thanks, GADGET-MOBILE.

489
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,700
Well ... I'm just gonna go up to the roof
and scope out the situation.

490
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,900
GADGET-MOBILE : You go ahead on
with your bad self--Ha!

491
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,800
I don't know what that
man would do without me.

492
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,900
GUARD : Hold on, there.

493
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,500
What do you want?

494
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,700
We got a delivery.

495
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,600
This ain't no food warehouse.
I'm gonna need some authorization.

496
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,700
Will that do?

497
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
We're in, Your Clawfulness.

498
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,200
CLAW : Good. Now bring me the 
ion fuel cells.

499
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,500
Yes, sir.

500
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,200
Halt!

501
00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:00,000
SQUINT : Oh! It's the mechanical meter maid!

502
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,900
I'm real scared!

503
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,700
Ha Ha Ha! Good one, Squint.

504
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:07,400
Uh-oh. Looks like G2 could use some backup.

505
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,800
Stop this felonious and unlawful act...

506
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,600
or I shall have to use force.

507
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,700
No problem, Love. Catch!

508
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,100
Huh?

509
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:23,100
Ooh ... Aah!

510
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,400
Ooh! She got the kung fu.

511
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,100
Aah!

512
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,600
Oh ... Aah!

513
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,500
I'm gonna give them a little bit
of the what for, that's right!

514
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,700
Stupid glitches!

515
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,800
JUNGLE BOB : Come on! Come on, you! Rrr!

516
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,500
 Aah-ha-ha!

517
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,400
Whoa! Ohh.

518
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,300
Hyah!

519
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,000
Whoa!

520
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,600
Aah!

521
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,300
Wowsers, she sure is limber.

522
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,600
Huh? Huh?

523
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,500
What is that? I don't know.

524
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,400
Oh, I don't like this.

525
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,100
Oh, no!

526
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,900
McKIBLE : Hurry it up. bonehead!

527
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:40,600
Wowsers. I never knew I had one of these.

528
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,300
G2 : Stop this felonious and unlawful act...

529
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,400
or I shall have to use force.

530
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,900
Oh ... Aah!

531
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,400
You imbecile!

532
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,900
COMPUTER VOICE : Suspect. Suspect.

533
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,200
G2 : Very well. You were warned.

534
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:04,000
Gadget to the rescue!

535
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,700
Ooh ... Unh!

536
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:15,200
No! No!

537
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,300
What are you doing here?

538
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:22,100
Well, it looked like ... 
Claw's Dominions : Quick, Grab the fuel cells!

539
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,300
Let's get out of here! Come on!

540
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,800
G2 : They're getting away.

541
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,600
Not to worry, G2. I'll get us out of this.

542
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,900
CHIEF : Gadget!

543
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:37,700
I told you specifically not to go to the stakeout.

544
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,500
That's not entirely accurate, Chief.

545
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,500
You told me not to get within
100 yards of the stakeout...

546
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:51,000
and I posted myself exactly 101 yards away.

547
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,800
Then how did you managed to get tangled up
with me inside the warehouse?

548
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:56,900
You gave me backup at the bar I thought
I'd give you backup at the warehouse.

549
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,900
I never need backup.

550
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,900
Until we find out what Claw needs the fuel cells for...

551
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,900
all of Riverton is at risk.

552
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,200
Chief, you have to put me back on the case.

553
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,600
The department needs me!

554
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,100
That's right, Gadget.

555
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,700
The department does need you.

556
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,500
And I've got just the assignment...

557
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,300
to take advantage of your unique abilities.

558
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,000
Come on, come on.

559
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,600
I'm stuck.

560
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,100
Aah!

561
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,600
 <br> <u>Go, Go,

562
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,400
Stop!

563
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Aah!

564
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:08,000
Ah ... ah ... oh ... oh ... oh ... ow.

565
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,900
Be careful in there.

566
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,600
That toilet's got quite a flush.

567
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:19,600
Looks like Gadget has finally
found his true calling ...

568
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,200
Roto-rooter man. Ha ha ha!

569
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,700
Hey, Dr. Claw, check this out ...

570
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,100
an unlimited supply of bowling shirts.

571
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,200
And shoes!

572
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,700
CLAW : Silence!

573
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,400
Everyone, pay attention!

574
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,200
Who can tell me what we need next...

575
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,500
to build my super weapon?

576
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,400
Uh...

577
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,200
CLAW : The laser.!

578
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:49,300
A new experimental protoid laser....

579
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:53,300
that's being unveiled at
the Riverton Science Convention.

580
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:59,200
But to take it, we are going
to need a little divulsion.

581
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,900
Hey, Uncle Gadget.

582
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,400
Penny? shouldn't you be in school?

583
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,900
Uncle Gadget, school was over an hour ago.

584
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:11,400
Oh. I'm sorry, Penny.

585
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,700
Oh. hey!

586
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,300
This came for you in the mail today.

587
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,600
Looks kind of strange.

588
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,600
"Inspector Gadget..."

589
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,300
Wowsers! He must have really bad hand-writing...

590
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,500
to go to all that trouble.

591
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,600
Or maybe he doesn't want you
to identify his hand-writing.

592
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,500
And, look, it's signed "Anonymous Concerned Citizen."

593
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,200
Well, it's good to know we still have
a concerned citizen who's willing to get involved.

594
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,800
This is supposed to Claw.

595
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:46,100
No. Why would Claw want me there?

596
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,000
I don't know.

597
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,400
Uncle Gadget, this might be a trap.

598
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:55,700
You know Penny, I'm thinking that
this might be a trap.

599
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,000
That's what I just said.

600
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,700
You gotta let me come with you this time.

601
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,700
Sorry, Penny. No can do.

602
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,800
This is work for a serious
law enforcement professional.

603
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,200
You mean like a bathroom attendant?

604
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,700
Exactly.

605
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:13,000
Don't stay up for me, Penny.

606
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,200
I'm on the case.

607
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,900
No. I need you to keep a sharp eye out, GADGET-MOBILE.

608
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,700
If you see anything suspicious, you let me know.

609
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,300
GADGET-MOBILE : Like a Trekkie with a girlfriend?

610
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,100
GADGET : Exactly.

611
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:37,100
CLAW : The goose has arrived ready to be cooked.

612
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,700
MAN : Here we go. How's that?

613
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,200
Yeah. now. I'll just ...

614
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,600
Even at this level? Wow!

615
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,500
Round and round.

616
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,900
RADIO : In sports. the National Hockey League ...

617
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:00,200
GADGET : Hmm...

618
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,100
Keep your eyes peeled for anything suspicious, Brain.

619
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,900
Come on.

620
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,700
BAXTER : Inspector. Gadget!

621
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:12,000
Hey, Baxter! What are you doing here?

622
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,700
I'm showing off my latest gizmo ...

623
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,600
the bark translator.

624
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,900
It's going to give a whole new meaning ...

625
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,000
to the term "police dog."

626
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,200
Watch.

627
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,000
Speak, Pedro.

628
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,300
Very impressive. Now Pedro can talk to cows.

629
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:34,900
No, No, No, No. It's supposed
to translate into English...

630
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,400
once I've got all the bugs out.

631
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,200
MAN : Attention. the unveiling of
the new protoid laser ...

632
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,900
is about to begin.

633
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,900
I'll see you around, Baxter.

634
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,500
Bye Bye, Pedro. Good luck!

635
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,700
Pedro.

636
00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:00,400
Well, better have myself a little look around.

637
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:09,500
Inspector Gadget!
Inspector Gadget!

638
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:12,600
Inspector Gadget!

639
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:17,500
Excuse me, Inspector. I'm your biggest fan.

640
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,700
BRICK : I thought I was his biggest fan.

641
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,100
No. I'm definitely his biggest fan.

642
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,800
No. I'm his biggest fan.

643
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,300
Will you excuse me for one minute?

644
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,800
Sorry.

645
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,000
Would you mind if we took a picture?

646
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:33,900
Oh, No, No. I'm always happy to oblige my fans.

647
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,900
Ready?

648
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:39,100
Say cheese.

649
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,800
Cheese. Cheese.

650
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,200
Heh Heh Heh. Thank you, Inspector.

651
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,200
You'll never know how much that means to me.

652
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,000
Well, it's my pleasure.

653
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:51,900
And remember, crime doesn't pay.

654
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,100
CLAW : Wrong, Gadget.

655
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:57,500
Crime always pays. Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!

656
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,700
Thank you, thank you.

657
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,300
Distinguished guests...

658
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,300
and, of course, all members.

659
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,600
It is my great pleasure to welcome you...

660
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,500
to my ..whoops.. our science convention.

661
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,400
The chip is in position, Your Clawfulness, Yeah!

662
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,900
Watch as I play with my new toy...

663
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,800
the Gadget puppet.

664
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,900
Guess that letter must've been a prank.

665
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,800
Everything seems OK.

666
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,400
Oh.

667
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,600
I've never had glitches like that before.

668
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,900
MAYOR : And to introduce you to the eminent...

669
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:52,100
Nobel-prize winning scientist,
Dr. Theodore Von Sprokenwich.

670
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,800
Thank you very much.

671
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,400
Thank you. thank you.

672
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,800
It's so nice to be here in Riverton.

673
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,200
Ah ... ah ... ah.

674
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,700
...his new experimental protoid laser.

675
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:20,300
Think positive, no-glitch...

676
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,800
thoughts.

677
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,400
All right, Gadget, let's party!

678
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,500
Ha ha.

679
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,500
Whoa ... whoa ... whoa.

680
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,700
I'm sorry! Should come out with a little soda water.

681
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,300
Inspector Gadget, what do you think you're doing?

682
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:42,600
 anything.

683
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,100
Huh ... unh ... oh.

684
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,900
Oh, no, Uncle Gadget, what now?

685
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,500
Oh ... Whoa ... Whoa!

686
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,500
What's wrong, Inspector?

687
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,400
I think I'm having a glitch attack.

688
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,700
Ha Ha Ha!

689
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,400
Hyah!

690
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,300
Sorry!

691
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,800
Unh! Hyah! Excuse me.

692
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,400
Whoa ... Mickey.

693
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:08,200
Woof! Woof! "Woof"?

694
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,400
Let's go!

695
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,800
GADGET-MOBILE, help!

696
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,800
I was right!

697
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,900
Claw's men are stealing the laser!

698
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,200
Don't let them get away. Hurry!

699
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,600
We got away with it.

700
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,500
BRICK : You know what ... this thing's heavy.

701
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,800
[Growling]

702
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,400
Hey! Aah! These are my favorite shoes!

703
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,600
Get in the car!

704
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,400
Gadget, I said stop it this instant!

705
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,000
I've got everything under control.

706
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,200
Ooh!

707
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,600
Oh!

708
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,700
GADGET : Relax! Mayor, Wilson!

709
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,800
It's only toothpaste.

710
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:05,200
Remember, kids. Brushing is twice a day ...

711
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,200
Aah!

712
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,800
Aah ... Aah!

713
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,300
...Aah! ...Aah!

714
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,600
Whoa!

715
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,800
Ooh.

716
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,300
Easy.

717
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,500
Ew.

718
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,700
Not to worry. I'm all right.

719
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,700
You!

720
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,200
Oof! He's got my shoe!

721
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,700
Bad doggy! Let's go.

722
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,900
First ion fuel cells and now a protoid laser?

723
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,200
What is Claw up to?

724
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,100
GADGET-MOBILE : Huh? What'd I miss this time?

725
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,700
PENNY : Thanks for all your help.

726
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,400
GADGET-MOBILE : Hey! I've been working nights, OK?

727
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,200
I need to recharge my battery.

728
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Brain? What you got there, boy?

729
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,000
From the bad guys?

730
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,900
Hey, now this might be an important clue.

731
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,200
I hope Uncle Gadget's not in too much trouble.

732
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,100
Fired? You can't fire me.

733
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,000
I quit! 
Hmm...

734
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,700
Wait a second. I don't want to quit.

735
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:22,800
Besides, Chief, It's not my fault.
Look what Baxter found on me ...

736
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,400
a circuit override chip.

737
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,900
I don't care! Claw stole the laser ...

738
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,000
and you tarred and feathered the mayor in toothpaste...

739
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,000
and caused $100,000 in damages.

740
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,500
Turn in your badge, Gadget.

741
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,800
Oh, but, Chief...

742
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,600
all I ever wanted to be my entire life...

743
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,600
was a crime fighter.

744
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,600
Your badge.

745
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:05,500
Well, that'll be all ... Mr. Gadget.

746
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,200
CLAW : Gadget's goose is cooked ...

747
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,800
more like deep-fried and burnt to a crisp.

748
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,400
Ha Ha Ha ... !

749
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,500
Silence!

750
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:46,300
Now, with Gadget out of the way...

751
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,500
it should be smooth sailing from here on.

752
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:52,900
Ha Ha Ha!

753
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:57,600
GADGET : Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

754
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,400
Hmm.

755
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,400
Uncle Gadget?

756
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,400
What are you still doing in bed?

757
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:14,300
And, why is your trench coat and hat in the trash can?

758
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,600
I'm no longer a policeman, Penny.

759
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,000
I'm a ... Well ...

760
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,900
There are a lot of things that I could be.

761
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,200
Window washer, huh?

762
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,900
Dog catcher ... Ooh, parking valet.

763
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,900
Sky's the limit.

764
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,200
But, Uncle Gadget, you can't give up now.

765
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,100
Here! look what we've got.

766
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,600
It's a bowling shoe.

767
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:40,400
One of Claw's men dropped it
at the Science Convention.

768
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,700
What were you doing at the Science Convention?

769
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,500
Never mind that. Look! We can solve this together.

770
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,500
We can track down Claw and get you your job back.

771
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
No. I'm through.

772
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,500
All right then, I'll track down Claw myself.

773
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:59,800
No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No ...

774
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,600
You are to stay out of this completely.
Do you understand?

775
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,800
This is a grown-up problem.

776
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:08,500
Uncle Gadget, just give me a chance.

777
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,600
One chance.

778
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:18,800
But, the fact is that there is nothing
that you or anyone else can do for me.

779
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:21,400
I'll never be a crime fighter.

780
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,900
Never again.

781
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,800
PENNY : You don't believe in me.

782
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:42,400
Go away, Brain!

783
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,100
Brain, go away!

784
00:45:55,900 --> 00:46:00,000
OK, OK, I get the message.

785
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,200
It's up to us now, Brain.

786
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,000
We have to help Uncle Gadget.

787
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:14,000
Come on, let's get to work.

788
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:31,600
That's lunch, people.

789
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:50,700
All finished! Voila.

790
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,700
WOMAN : Aah!

791
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,900
What's this?

792
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,400
A patent number.

793
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,400
Aha.

794
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:10,800
CLAW : Faster ... minions ... faster ...

795
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,000
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha!

796
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:19,800
G2, are you any closer to capturing Claw?

797
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,700
Yes. I'm on the case.

798
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,100
Hmm.

799
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,300
 Oh, No.

800
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,800
Keep your paws crossed. Brain.

801
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,700
This might be exactly what we're looking for.

802
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:37,700
Look. It's the same shoe.

803
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,500
The shoe was made by the Bowl-Rite Company...

804
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,200
in the 1950s and 1960s.

805
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,800
I wonder where their factory was.

806
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:48,300
Let's see ... 1959 ... Bingo!

807
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,800
Ah, here it is. The Bowl-Rite
Bowling Equipment Company ... 

808
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,000
down on Old Mill Road.

809
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:04,300
It must've gone out of business, because it's not
in any of the directories after 1960.

810
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,600
I wonder what's there now, Brain.

811
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,100
CLAW : Now. the third item that I need ... Huh?

812
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:13,900
"I'm so evil... Blah blah blah ... "

813
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,400
Argh!

814
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,500
As I was saying ...

815
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,600
the third item to complete my super weapon.

816
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:27,200
I know this one, the ruby!

817
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,900
Yes, but a big ruby!

818
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:34,500
say about 50,000 karats. Heh heh heh!

819
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,000
Your Clawsomeness...

820
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:38,200
where are we going to find a rock that big?

821
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,000
The Riverton Museum.

822
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:43,800
The ruby's on loan from the Raja of India...

823
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,100
and will be on display Wednesday night...

824
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,000
at the mayor's Fund-Raiser.

825
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,900
We are going to stop by...

826
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,900
and do a little fund-raising of our own.

827
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,800
GADGET : Good evening. Ladies and Gentlemen ...

828
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:03,800
and welcome to Mayor. Wilson's Fund-Raiser, orama ...

829
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,300
MAYOR : Oh.

830
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,800
CHIEF : Ow! Ohh.

831
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,200
Gadget.

832
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,200
Don't worry, Chief. No need to tip me.

833
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,200
We better be getting inside.

834
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:15,300
Yeah. It's nice in there.

835
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,900
MAYOR : I'm here.

836
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,200
Good evening. Good evening, Everyone.

837
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,000
Yes. it's me. Ha!

838
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,800
Break out the cameras.

839
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:37,300
Ooh, another photo-op.

840
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:46,000
G2, notice anything suspicious
about those musicians?

841
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:50,100
Aside from the fact the music doesn't match 
the instruments they're playing?

842
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,800
Come on, Brain.

843
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:01,400
Yep. This is definitely the place.

844
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,100
At least the building's still here.

845
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,700
I don't know, Brain. Spread is creepy.

846
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:21,700
Welcome, sir. Welcome Lady Campbell,
how wonderful you could come.

847
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,800
Lovely to see you, sir.

848
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,100
Oh! Claw!

849
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,000
Aah!

850
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,400
CLAW : Greetings. Mayor..

851
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,200
Hope you don't mind if we drop in
on your little party.

852
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:38,500
Everybody stop right where you are.

853
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,800
The festivities have just begun...

854
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:44,100
and I can promise it's going to be a gas--

855
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:46,200
Laughing gas, that is.

856
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,500
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha!

857
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,100
Ho ho ho ho!

858
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:53,000
That's right. Laugh it up, Riverton...

859
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:57,700
because I am having the last laugh now.

860
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:10,300
Rah ha ha ha ha ha!

861
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,400
<br>It must be
It must be quite a party.

862
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:18,100
Do something to stop him, Chief Quimby.

863
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,700
You'll never get away with this, Claw.

864
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,300
We'll see.

865
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:25,100
Ha Ha Ha Ha! G2, see.

866
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:28,500
Very funny, Claw. But you forget ...

867
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:30,800
I am unaffected by laughing gas.

868
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:36,500
Now stop this felonious and unlawful act
or I shall have to use force.

869
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,800
Ah, the lady Gadget.

870
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:41,700
I've so looked forward to meeting you.

871
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,800
I hope you don't fall victim tonight ...

872
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,600
to my magnetic charm.

873
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,800
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!

874
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,600
Ha Ha Ha Oh!

875
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,500
Hee Hee Hee! Aah!

876
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,300
Oh! Oh!

877
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:14,800
Mmm! Unh!

878
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:26,300
Now if you'll excuse me, G2...

879
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:29,100
I have some shop lifting to do.

880
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,700
Ha Ha Ha!

881
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:38,600
It looks like someone's been here ...

882
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,600
and recently, too.

883
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,200
Aah!

884
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,600
Thanks, Brain.

885
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,600
Do you see that?

886
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,800
Brain, look!

887
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,900
It's a perfect match.

888
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,700
GADGET : Done so soon?

889
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,700
McKIBLE : Yeah. We were playing
the "Unfinished Symphony."

890
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,400
BRICK : Yeah. And then we took
this giant ruby.

891
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:24,100
Yeah. That was the name of our last song.

892
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,200
You know "We took this giant ruby"?

893
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,100
"Took this giant ruby"

894
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:35,200
"Stole this giant ruby"

895
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:37,100
Just a minute, there.

896
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,100
Huh?

897
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,500
Let me get that for you.

898
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,700
CLAW : Thank you, Inspector.

899
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:50,400
GADGET : That's it. Everybody in.

900
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,900
Thank you.

901
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,900
Nice to carpool, isn't it?

902
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,300
Yeah. There.

903
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:03,100
No tip. They stiffed me again.

904
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:05,000
I live on tips!

905
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:12,900
Brain, take a look at this.
Fuel cells ... that's what Claw
stole from the warehouse.

906
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:16,500
Laser ... that's what Claw took
from the Science Convention.

907
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,000
"Ruby"

908
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:21,500
What would Claw want with a ruby?

909
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,600
"QUANTUM PHYSICS FOR DIMWITES"

910
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:29,400
OK, Claw's definitely up to something big.

911
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:32,200
Wait a minute. I know what Claw's up to.

912
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,600
He's going to build ...

913
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,700
Come on, Brain!

914
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,600
We're rich! Hey, Hey!

915
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:49,300
Hey! How much do you think this
thing would fetch on E-bay?

916
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,600
About $1.98.

917
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,700
CLAW : No, nitwits.

918
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,100
Once we've robbed the Federal Reserve...

919
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:57,300
we can buy hundreds of these baubles.

920
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:01,500
With my secret weapon,
Riverton will be defenseless ... 

921
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,300
as will the rest of the world!

922
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,400
I've got to tell Uncle Gadget.

923
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:08,300
Come on.

924
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,500
Well, it's an agent mini-Gadget.
Get her!

925
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,300
JUNGLE BOB : Come on. Let's go!

926
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,300
SQUINT : This way! Come on!

927
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,000
Whoa! Ahh!

928
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:30,400
McKIBLE : She's getting away!
I'll cut her off at the pass.
Come here!

929
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,100
Aah!

930
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,300
Gotcha!

931
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,000
Whoa! Ohh!

932
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,400
Uhh ...

933
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:40,400
Yeah! Get back here.

934
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,800
Get her!

935
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,500
Aah! 

936
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:50,200
Hey, isn't this the place to get
new bowling shoes?

937
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,600
MEN : No! Uh-uh.

938
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I assure you, Ms. Mayor.

939
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,500
We'll do everything in our power
to apprehend Claw.

940
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:58,900
G2 will be ...

941
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,500
G2 is finished ...

942
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:03,000
along with the whole Gadget program.

943
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,500
It's time we reinvested ...

944
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:07,900
in some good old-fashioned
policemen and women ....

945
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,100
not these mechanical clowns.

946
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,400
Ms. Mayor, if you just give me
another chance ...

947
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,300
You had your chance.

948
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,400
It's bad enough they stole the ruby...

949
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,800
but what's worse...

950
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,800
no one gave any money to my campaign.

951
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,700
I should've learned my lesson with Gadget.

952
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:31,000
This whole program is a total waste of time.

953
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:30,800
Come on, G2.

954
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:35,900
We're taking you to the precinct
for immediate deactivation.

955
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,400
Deactivation?

956
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:40,100
That's right. Deactivation.

957
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,400
Hmm.

958
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:57,100
GADGET : I'm sorry. G2.

959
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,500
Thank you...

960
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:05,100
but there's nothing you can do.

961
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,100
Now, G2.

962
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:29,600
Nothing I can do.

963
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:31,300
Hmm.

964
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,700
 Or is there?

965
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:46,100
OK.

966
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:52,400
Now, where's that light switch?

967
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,100
Aah!

968
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,300
Aah! Aah! Ow!

969
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,700
Ohh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

970
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:04,100
Wrong switch.

971
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:08,900
 <br> Ah ...
Ah ...

972
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:45,900
What happened?

973
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:48,800
I reactivated you.

974
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:53,400
Inspector Gadget, why would you do that?

975
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:58,100
Well, I hate to see a good
detective get recycled ...

976
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,900
and I've always had great admiration ...

977
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:06,700
for your investigative abilities
and physical prowess ...

978
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:10,900
your commanding voice.

979
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:16,100
Inspector, are you saying you like me?

980
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:22,800
Oh, I suppose. In a manner of speaking.

981
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:28,400
Strictly professional.

982
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,900
Huh?

983
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:37,200
Mm-mmm. Ha ha ha.

984
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,600
Thank you.

985
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,200
You're welcome.

986
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:51,100
Brain, What are you doing here?
Where's Penny?

987
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:56,000
Ooh~ He's trying to tell me something.

988
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,400
It's too bad I don't speak dog.

989
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,100
If only dogs could talk like people.

990
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,600
That would be good ... 

991
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:08,700
Wait a second. I have an idea.

992
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:12,500
All right, Brain. Now speak!

993
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:24,900
Heh heh.

994
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,300
Bowwow.

995
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:31,700
Brain...speak something else.

996
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,200
BRAIN : Check. Testing
1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3.

997
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,500
Penny has been kidnapped by Claw.

998
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:41,200
Amazing! isn't it? what modern
technology can do?

999
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:44,900
Wowsers! Penny's been kidnapped by Claw?

1000
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:49,600
Yeah, and Claw's had some sort of
giant laser and he's going to fire at
Riverton and rob the Federal Reserve.

1001
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:55,800
He's holding Penny captive at the old
Bowl-Rite Bowling Factory on
the outskirts of town.

1002
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:57,500
The bowling factory?

1003
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:00,000
Of course. The bowling shoe.

1004
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,500
Penny was right.

1005
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:06,700
I should've listened to her.

1006
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:11,400
She tried to tell me, and I didn't listen to her.
BRAIN : Speaking of listening...

1007
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,700
I'm getting a little tired of
liver-flavored kibble over time.

1008
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:19,100
Would it kill you to shell out
for a pork roast or prime rib?

1009
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:26,800
Look, G2! My niece's in trouble. I know that
you don't ever work with a partner but...

1010
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:27,600
I really need your help.

1011
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:30,900
Are you sure you want my help?

1012
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:36,100
I can't think of a better person
to go after a supervillain with.

1013
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,900
All right, let's do it!

1014
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,200
Let's kick some Claw tail.

1015
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,900
Ready? ... Ready.

1016
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,200
Let's go.

1017
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,900
McKIBLE : We're here. Your Clawsomeness.

1018
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,500
PENNY : Claw. you'll never get away with this.

1019
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:25,400
Penny, my dear, prepare to witness
a great historical moment.

1020
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,800
Your demise?

1021
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:30,000
Ha Ha Ha! I do enjoy your sense of humor.

1022
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:32,900
Now, it's almost 9:23.

1023
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:35,300
McKible! Activate the ray.

1024
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:42,100
Why can't evil geniuses ever say "please"?

1025
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,600
He's a very busy man.

1026
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:45,800
I'm a busy man, too.

1027
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:53,400
Whoa ... Behold!

1028
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:58,100
The greatest super weapon of the 21st Century.

1029
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,400
A bowling pin?

1030
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,200
CLAW : No. you dim-witted pea-brain.

1031
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:03,500
Watch and see.

1032
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:08,400
Whoa.

1033
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,900
Double whoa.

1034
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:14,600
Meet the time displacement laser ...

1035
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:19,700
my crowning achievement in a lifetime of evil.

1036
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:24,300
Riverton doesn't stand a chance.

1037
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:26,300
Hurry, GADGET-MOBILE, before they
fire the giant laser.

1038
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:28,300
Can't you make this jalopy go any faster?

1039
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,900
Jalopy? Oh, yeah?

1040
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:36,800
Well, bring on the noise and bring on the funk
'cause I'm bringing out what's in my trunk.

1041
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:43,300
And just wait until I get into second gear.

1042
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:48,500
CLAW : Time for. Riverton to take a little snooze.

1043
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:48,600
Ha Ha!

1044
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,700
Fire away!

1045
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:58,400
Ah Ha Ha!

1046
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:27,000
 Awesome!

1047
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:30,200
 Bomb's away!

1048
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,400
REPORTER : Over, here! Mayor. Wilson.

1049
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Whoo ooh!

1050
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,600
It's gaining on us.

1051
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,200
Faster, Faster.

1052
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,200
GADGET : Wowsers! That was close.

1053
01:04:55,900 --> 01:05:00,500
Riverton is in a deep freeze, Your Clawcity.

1054
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:02,800
That means time has stopped.

1055
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,700
That's what I said.

1056
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:12,000
Good! Now we won't have any trouble with traffic.
Ha Ha Ha Ha!

1057
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,600
Uncle Gadget.

1058
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:19,700
The rail looks like it's stopped.
You think it's safe to go back?

1059
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:23,100
There's no time to waste.
We got to stop Claw and rescue Penny.

1060
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:25,300
Then to the Federal Reserve and step on it.

1061
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:27,700
It's time to kick some bad guy booty.

1062
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:39,000
We're just here to pick up a few
hundred billion in bullion.

1063
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,400
Hope you don't mind.

1064
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:45,700
I don't think he minds ... a bit.

1065
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:53,500
Time to show me the money.

1066
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:24,300
It'll take weeks to crack this thing.

1067
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:29,300
Not if you know the right people.

1068
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:31,800
Thank you. Mr. Bank Director..

1069
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:36,000
Your services are no longer required.

1070
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:54,000
McKIBLE : We're rich! Rich!

1071
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,100
CLAW : OK. underlings...

1072
01:06:54,700 --> 01:07:04,000
looks like the Federal Reserve is having
a 100% off sale! Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1073
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:06,000
GADGET-MOBILE : Out of my way,
G Team coming through.

1074
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:10,600
I'm going to need a really big piggy bank.

1075
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:09,500
McKIBLE : Come on, Brick! Faster! Faster!
CLAW : Now, let's see.

1076
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:19,300
Tomorrow we rob for N.O.X,
then on Tuesday, the Louvre.

1077
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:24,800
So much to steal, so little time
Wait! I've got all the time in the world.

1078
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:30,700
GADGET-MOBILE : The cavalry has arrived.

1079
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:32,500
Huh? Gadget again.

1080
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,900
Uncle Gadget, you're all right?

1081
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:37,100
Aah! Come here, you.

1082
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:39,000
Oh!

1083
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:44,500
GADGET : The jig is up. Claw. You're under
arrest for kidnapping, bank robbery,
breaking out of prison...

1084
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:45,600
and general all-around evil.

1085
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:48,000
The jig is most certainly not up.

1086
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:47,400
In fact, the jig is just about to destroy it.

1087
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:55,900
You want me to play dentist with your niece?

1088
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,700
PENNY : Uncle Gadget! Help! Help!

1089
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,800
Brick! McKible!

1090
01:07:57,300 --> 01:08:00,500
PENNY : Help!

1091
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:01,400
Get in there, you. Aah!

1092
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:04,000
Dr. Claw, what about us? Yeah man...

1093
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:07,700
You're minions, aren't you?
Get the good guys!

1094
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:12,000
PENNY : Uncle Gadget. help! help!

1095
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:17,100
Help! Help me!

1096
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,600
I'll take care of these clowns.
You go after Claw.

1097
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:22,700
Good call, G2.

1098
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,700
Stupid glitches.

1099
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:30,500
I hate being last year's model.

1100
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:35,600
Here! let me give you something
from this year's model.

1101
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:37,300
Take one of my chips.

1102
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:42,300
G2, but...then you might get the glitches.

1103
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,000
I'll manage.

1104
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:58,000
OK. Better stand back.

1105
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:03,900
Whoa. It works.

1106
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:12,000
It works! It works!

1107
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:16,700
GADGET-MOBILE : You go get 'em. G.

1108
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,600
Whoa!

1109
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:20,500
This shouldn't take long.

1110
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,800
GADGET-MOBILE : Time to take out the trash.
G-girl and don't bother to recycle.

1111
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:36,200
Whoa! Whoa!

1112
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,900
Whoa!

1113
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,700
Dr. Claw, it's Gadget.

1114
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:52,800
CLAW : Uhh. Not again.

1115
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,200
Oh, Uncle Gadget.

1116
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,600
Don't worry.

1117
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:57,600
Time for Gadget to go out with a bang.

1118
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:03,700
Help!

1119
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:05,700
 Ow!

1120
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:19,400
Sorry.

1121
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:23,000
Oh~~ No!
Ooh!

1122
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:24,700
He's still after us.

1123
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,200
CLAW : McKible. Lose him!

1124
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:37,800
Hyah!

1125
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:40,200
Grr.

1126
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,800
Ouch.

1127
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,200
Oh, well.

1128
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:06,100
I guess when you have lemons, make lemonade.

1129
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,400
CLAW : Care for a smoke, Gadget?

1130
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,600
Aah!

1131
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:25,200
Ow ... ow ... ow ... ow!

1132
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,300
Aah!

1133
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,200
Ow ... ow ... ow ... Unh!

1134
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,300
Puhh!

1135
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:42,600
PENNY : Uncle Gadget! Help!

1136
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,100
BOTH: Whoa!

1137
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,700
Oh. Huh?

1138
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,700
What is this? I can't move!

1139
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:11,300
I guess glitches sometimes
do have their benefits.

1140
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:13,400
Let me out! Hey! Get me out of here!

1141
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,300
Looks like this case is about wrapped up.

1142
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:19,700
Hey, I just made a joke.

1143
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:27,600
Unh! Hey, hey, hey!

1144
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:32,000
Huh! Huh! Huh!

1145
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Gangway!

1146
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:36,100
Whoop ... Look out!

1147
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:38,500
Police emergency. Coming through.

1148
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,800
Whoop ... Excuse me.

1149
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:51,400
GADGET-MOBILE, we have to find
Inspector Gadget.

1150
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:54,500
No problem. Gadget homing device activated.

1151
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,500
Coming to get you, Claw.

1152
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:10,000
Huh! He's on the roof!

1153
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,300
on the roof?

1154
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,800
Uncle Gadget, help!

1155
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,900
McKible, get him off!

1156
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,600
Take some of that, Gadget!

1157
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:19,700
Whoa! Whoa!

1158
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,500
Whoa!

1159
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:27,400
GADGET : Help!

1160
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:30,100
Time to switch to Plan "B"!

1161
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:35,600
Ha ha.

1162
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:49,300
Claw, stop the truck and come out
with your claw up!

1163
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:51,400
You know, Gadget, there's one true detective...

1164
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:53,200
in your family, and it isn't you.

1165
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:56,500
Too bad you didn't listen to her
when you had the chance.

1166
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:58,600
Penny? Penny?

1167
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Now it's time to say good-bye
to me and to your partner!

1168
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:11,900
PENNY : Aah!

1169
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,200
Aah! Aah!

1170
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:16,700
Uncle Gadget, help!

1171
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:21,900
She has 60 seconds! Ha ha ha ha!

1172
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,600
PENNY : Help me!

1173
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:28,000
Don't worry, Penny! I'm coming!

1174
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:34,100
 Unh.

1175
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:37,000
Uh...

1176
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:41,000
Who put that there?

1177
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:43,000
PENNY : Uncle Gadget. help!

1178
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,700
Penny?

1179
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:49,100
Aah!

1180
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:50,000
Uncle Gadget!

1181
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,900
Penny, are you OK?

1182
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:54,300
Claw's getting away.

1183
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:56,300
That's not important right now.

1184
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:59,500
Penny, you are the only thing
that matters to me.

1185
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,900
Uncle Gadget, the bomb--

1186
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:05,100
It's gonna explode! Hurry!

1187
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,300
Hurry!

1188
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:19,400
Got it! Let's go!

1189
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,800
Whoa!

1190
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:36,000
Oh, no.

1191
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:41,000
CLAW : Ha ha ha ha!

1192
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:45,400
I always like my Gadget well done.

1193
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:48,800
I got here too late.

1194
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:52,200
GADGET-MOBILE : They're gone forever..

1195
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:56,700
It's the closest I've ever come
to being a family car.

1196
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:57,300
Why?

1197
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,500
Uncle Gadget?

1198
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,800
Uncle Gadget?

1199
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,700
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.

1200
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:17,200
Not to worry. I only landed on my head.

1201
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:19,400
They're alive! They're alive!

1202
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,900
They're alive!

1203
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:23,100
Uncle Gadget! 
Oh!

1204
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,600
You saved my life.

1205
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:27,400
I was so worried about you.

1206
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:28,800
G2 : Good Work, Penny.

1207
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,500
Thanks, G2.

1208
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,700
Brain!

1209
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:36,500
Glad to see you still fully
functioning, Gadget.

1210
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:39,700
Well, thank you, G2.

1211
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,100
Oh.

1212
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:47,300
No time to celebrate now.

1213
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:51,200
We have to catch Claw.

1214
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:52,800
Let's go.

1215
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:54,100
Ooh. Ow.

1216
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,000
I'll go this way.

1217
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:59,100
GADGET-MOBILE : Hang on.
I know a shortcut.

1218
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:23,400
Don't worry. I'll handle this.

1219
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:25,100
What? Gadget again?

1220
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:28,000
There's only one way to deal with a pest.

1221
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:30,100
McKible, run him over.

1222
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:33,400
One order of road kill coming right up.

1223
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,900
Bubble gum?

1224
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:47,500
Bubble gum? Bubble gum?

1225
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:57,400
CLAW : Ha ha ha! Missed us!

1226
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,500
Looks like Gadget just blew his last bubble.

1227
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,600
Ha Ha Ha!

1228
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:09,400
I can't look.

1229
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,400
Hmm.

1230
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:17,500
Huh? 
Huh?

1231
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:22,900
Here comes the good part.

1232
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,500
ALL : Aah!

1233
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:28,900
Ha ha ha ha!

1234
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:37,200
Uhh! Let's get out of here!

1235
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,200
BOTH : Whoa!

1236
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:49,100
Now, that's what I call as sticky situation.

1237
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:56,300
What do we do now?
What we always do.

1238
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:59,400
BOTH : We surrender!

1239
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:05,800
Claw! come out with your hand
and your claw up!

1240
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:13,200
Whoa. 
What is that?

1241
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,800
McKIBLE : I never knew we had one of those.

1242
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:16,800
CLAW : You may have won this round...

1243
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:20,200
But, I'll get you next time, Gadget.

1244
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:23,500
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1245
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:37,500
GADGET : Come on.
It's not responding.

1246
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,400
PENNY : He must've put in
his own security code.

1247
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:41,600
Then we'll just destroy it.
No!

1248
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,600
Then everyone will be frozen forever.

1249
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:45,200
We just have to think like Claw.

1250
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:48,000
What kind of a code would
a supervillain put in?

1251
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:49,200
 <br>I got it.
I got it.

1252
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:53,300
And I just lost it.

1253
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,300
Hey! wait a minute. I know.

1254
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:58,500
Let's try "Crime always pays."

1255
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,400
Not always, Claw.

1256
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:11,000
Hmm.

1257
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:13,900
BOY : Oh. yeah!

1258
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,600
And for heroically foiling
Dr. Claw and saving Riverton ...

1259
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:36,000
I would like to award Inspectors Gadget and G2 ...

1260
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:40,600
these distinguished conduct medals
for their service to this city.

1261
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,500
Yay!

1262
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:47,800
Congratulations, Gadget.

1263
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:53,200
CHIEF : I'd like to announce
that we are going to double ...

1264
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,900
the Gadget Unit's budget for next year...

1265
01:20:55,100 --> 01:21:01,300
so that if Claw ever tries to show
his face in Riverton again ...

1266
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:02,300
we'll be ready for him.

1267
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:04,300
Excuse me, Chief. If I just can do possibly....

1268
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:04,600
Even just for a second.

1269
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:18,100
The real secret to our success
has always been teamwork ...

1270
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:19,000
but there's one member of our team ...

1271
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:22,100
who hasn't been acknowledged yet.

1272
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:25,500
And so, for providing key support
to members of the Gadget team ... 

1273
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:31,200
I would like to award this
Junior Inspector medal...

1274
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:36,100
to Penny for her meritorious conduct.

1275
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,800
I couldn't have done it without you, Penny.

1276
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:47,500
You are one special kid...

1277
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,400
and I'm proud to have you as a partner.

1278
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:52,000
Thanks, Uncle Gadget.

1279
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:04,000
Yes, Brain. You're special, too

1280
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,800
GADGET-MOBILE : Hello? Anybody remember ...

1281
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:09,800
the internal combustion member of the team?

1282
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:13,000
What am I scrap metal? I helped. too.

1283
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,900
Where's my citation?

1284
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,000
What are you doing, man?

1285
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:18,700
Ooh! not that kind of citation.

1286
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:22,200
Good night, Gadget. See you Monday.

1287
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:23,000
Good night, Baxter.

1288
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:26,900
Night, Baxter.
Bye. Come on, Brain.

1289
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:27,800
Inspector.

1290
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:34,700
I wanted to say I may have been a bit premature
in my early evaluation of your abilities.

1291
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,900
Well, that's very big of you, G2.

1292
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:40,100
I was wrong to think of you
as inept, clumsy, imbecilic...

1293
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:40,500
Don't mention it.

1294
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:42,800
Obsolete, simple-minded, malfunctioning ...

1295
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:45,100
Yes, yes, I get the picture.

1296
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:51,600
Anyway, I look forward to more
teamwork in the future.

1297
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,500
Oh.

1298
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:15,700
I just love happy endings.

1299
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:28,000
It must be a loose wire or something else.

1300
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:32,100
I'll speak to Baxter about that.

1301
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,800
Don't bother.

1302
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:48,600
CHIEF : Huh? Oh.

1303
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:53,500
Oh.
Oh.

1304
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:02,300
Gadget!

1305
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:08,200
"Get ready or not. 'cause here I come"

1306
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:10,100
"Dance. dance. dance. Have some fun"

1307
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,600

1308
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,600
"Get up. get up "

1309
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:22,500
"Oh. no. never. ever. gonna stop"

1310
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:24,700
"Try and find a different drum "

1311
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:29,900
"Not gonna quit. get up. get up. get up "

1312
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:32,000
"Stand up. gonna make some noise "

1313
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:34,500
"Sing until they hear. my voice "

1314
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:38,000
"Can't keep me down. get up. get up "

1315
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:41,400
"Get ready or not. 'cause here I come "

"6. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1 "

1318
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:47,300
"Get up. get up "

1319
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:50,800
"Get up. up. up. oh. whoa "

1320
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,500
"Up. up. up "

1321
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:58,600
"Rain falls down on my parade "

1322
01:24:57,700 --> 01:25:00,800
"Lemons into lemonade "

1323
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:06,000
"Can't slow me down. no way. no way. no way "

1324
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,800
"Yesterday is in the past "

1325
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,200
"Dream on. tomorrow's comin' fast"

1326
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:14,000
"All you got is now. get up. get up "

1327
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:17,100
"Get ready or not. 'cause here I come "

1328
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:19,200
"Dance. dance. dance. Have some fun "

1329

01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,400
"Get up"

1337
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
"Get up"

1338
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:41,600
"Get up"

1339
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:43,900
"Get up"

1340
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:46,100
"Get up"

1341
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,500
"Get up"

1342
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:51,300
"Hey. you. don't let 'em see you frown "

1343
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:53,500
"Come on. turn it upside down "

1344
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:57,300
"Don't ever. quit. get up. get up "

1345

"When life puts you to the test"

1346
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:03,100
"There's nothing better than your best"

1347
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:05,300
"Show 'em what you got"

1348
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,800
"You got a lot"

1349
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,100

"Up. up. up. oh. whoa"

1355
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,100
"Up. up. up. higher.. higher."

1356
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:26,700
"Up. up. up. Hearts on Fire "
