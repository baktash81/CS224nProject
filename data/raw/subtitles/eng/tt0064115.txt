1
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:44,395
Good night, Pat.

2
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:45,658
Good night.

3
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,404
What happened to the old
bank? It was beautiful.

4
00:04:51,643 --> 00:04:52,905
People kept robbing it.

5
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:55,774
That's a small price to pay for beauty.

6
00:05:02,157 --> 00:05:03,021
Hit me.

7
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,589
Again.

8
00:05:12,135 --> 00:05:12,898
Bust!

9
00:05:15,388 --> 00:05:17,653
Give me credit, Mr. Macon?

10
00:05:17,925 --> 00:05:20,792
You know my rules, Tom.

11
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:25,147
Well, it looks like you just about
cleaned everybody out, fella.

12
00:05:26,053 --> 00:05:28,818
You haven't lost a hand
since you got the deal.

13
00:05:29,091 --> 00:05:31,356
What's the secret of your success?

14
00:05:34,597 --> 00:05:35,360
Prayer.

15
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,130
Let's just you and me play.

16
00:05:55,524 --> 00:05:56,422
Hit it.

17
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:02,931
Bust.

18
00:06:06,238 --> 00:06:09,504
Yeah, you're a hell of
a card player, fella.

19
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:13,543
I know, 'cause I'm a
hell of a card player,

20
00:06:13,781 --> 00:06:17,013
and I can't even spot
how you're cheating.

21
00:06:30,935 --> 00:06:33,097
The money stays, and you go.

22
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:37,371
Well, we seem to be

23
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,373
a little short on brotherly love

24
00:06:39,613 --> 00:06:40,580
around here.

25
00:06:40,815 --> 00:06:43,376
If you're with him, you
better get out of here.

26
00:06:43,618 --> 00:06:44,880
We're on our way.

27
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,382
I wasn't cheating.

28
00:06:46,621 --> 00:06:47,384
Come on.

29
00:06:47,623 --> 00:06:48,885
I wasn't cheating!

30
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,390
You can die. You can both die.

31
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:52,890
You hear that?

32
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,895
If he invites us to stay, then we'll go.

33
00:06:56,134 --> 00:06:58,398
He's got to invite us to stick around.

34
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:00,867
He'll draw on you.

35
00:07:01,073 --> 00:07:03,474
You don't know how fast he is.

36
00:07:11,553 --> 00:07:14,318
I'm over the hill, but
it can happen to you.

37
00:07:14,557 --> 00:07:16,821
That's just what I want to hear.

38
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,325
Every day you get older. That's a law.

39
00:07:29,076 --> 00:07:30,338
What would you think about

40
00:07:30,611 --> 00:07:32,876
maybe asking us to stick around?

41
00:07:33,081 --> 00:07:33,877
What?

42
00:07:34,115 --> 00:07:36,345
You don't have to mean it or anything.

43
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:38,883
Just ask us to stick
around. I promise...

44
00:07:46,631 --> 00:07:48,395
I can't help you, Sundance.

45
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:02,045
I didn't know you were the Sundance Kid

46
00:08:02,284 --> 00:08:03,980
when I said you were cheating.

47
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,654
I draw on you, you'll kill me.

48
00:08:09,893 --> 00:08:12,192
There's that possibility.

49
00:08:13,565 --> 00:08:14,828
You'd be killing yourself.

50
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:18,299
Why don't you just
invite us to stick around?

51
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,902
You can do it...

52
00:08:22,143 --> 00:08:23,405
and easy.

53
00:08:23,644 --> 00:08:25,635
Come on.

54
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:30,314
Come on.

55
00:08:31,421 --> 00:08:33,322
Why don't you stick around?

56
00:08:33,591 --> 00:08:36,526
Thanks, but we got to get going.

57
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:44,334
Hey, Kid.

58
00:08:44,604 --> 00:08:47,199
Hey, Kid, how good are you?

59
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:00,718
Like I been telling you...

60
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,050
over the hill.

61
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,089
Boy, you know,

62
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,267
every time I see
Hole-In-The-Wall,

63
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,765
it's like seeing it for the first time.

64
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,802
Every time, I ask myself
the same question...

65
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:11,035
how can I be so damn
stupid to keep coming back?

66
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:19,284
What's your idea this time?

67
00:10:19,558 --> 00:10:20,525
Bolivia.

68
00:10:23,295 --> 00:10:24,058
What's Bolivia?

69
00:10:24,297 --> 00:10:26,822
Bolivia... that's a country, stupid.

70
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:28,329
Central or South America.

71
00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:30,434
One or the other.

72
00:10:30,704 --> 00:10:32,468
Let's go to Mexico instead.

73
00:10:32,707 --> 00:10:34,972
All they got in Mexico is sweat.

74
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:36,940
There's too much of that here.

75
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:40,946
If we'd been in business
during the California gold rush,

76
00:10:41,218 --> 00:10:43,483
where would we have
gone? California, right?

77
00:10:43,721 --> 00:10:46,190
When I say Bolivia, you
just think California.

78
00:10:46,392 --> 00:10:48,656
You wouldn't believe
what they're finding

79
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:50,691
in the ground down there.

80
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,192
They're just falling into it.

81
00:10:52,432 --> 00:10:54,697
Silver mines, gold mines, tin mines.

82
00:10:54,935 --> 00:10:58,702
Payrolls so heavy we'd strain
ourselves stealing them.

83
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,106
You just keep thinking, Butch.

84
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:05,110
That's what you're good at.

85
00:11:05,349 --> 00:11:06,611
Boy, I got vision,

86
00:11:06,884 --> 00:11:09,649
and the rest of the
world wears bifocals.

87
00:11:31,581 --> 00:11:33,243
Hi, News. What you doing?

88
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:37,819
Aw, howdy, Butch. Uh, nothing.

89
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:39,319
Nothing.

90
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,719
Howdy, Sundance.

91
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:42,756
You sure are. You're
doing something. What?

92
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:48,764
<i>Just fixing to rob the
Union Pacific Flyer, Butch,</i>

93
00:11:49,003 --> 00:11:51,973
like what we had in mind.

94
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:56,441
You fellas got everything
I told you all wrong.

95
00:11:56,646 --> 00:11:58,581
<i>Sure, we might hit the Flyer,</i>

96
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,546
but even if we do, it won't be this run.

97
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:03,982
It'll be the next one, the return.

98
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,488
Sundance and me, we
been checking the banks.

99
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,623
No banks.

100
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:08,623
What?

101
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:11,228
<i>The Flyer, Butch.</i>

102
00:12:13,435 --> 00:12:16,199
Fellas, bad as they are,
banks are better than trains.

103
00:12:16,438 --> 00:12:18,202
They don't move. They stay put.

104
00:12:18,441 --> 00:12:20,204
You know the money's in there.

105
00:12:20,443 --> 00:12:21,934
When I left, I gave orders.

106
00:12:22,212 --> 00:12:23,975
New orders been given.

107
00:12:24,214 --> 00:12:25,978
I run things here, Harvey.

108
00:12:26,217 --> 00:12:27,980
Used to you did.

109
00:12:28,219 --> 00:12:29,653
Me now.

110
00:12:31,857 --> 00:12:33,052
This don't concern you.

111
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:37,764
You tell him to stay out.

112
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:40,491
Well, he goes his own way, like always.

113
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:42,532
What's the matter with you guys?

114
00:12:42,771 --> 00:12:44,034
When I came here,

115
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,003
you were nothing. I formed you.

116
00:12:46,242 --> 00:12:47,004
Who says?

117
00:12:47,243 --> 00:12:49,007
Read them a clipping, News.

118
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:50,008
Which one?

119
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:51,306
Any of them.

120
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:59,786
<i>This one here's from Salt Lake Herald.</i>

121
00:13:00,027 --> 00:13:02,086
Butch Cassidy's
Hole-In-The-Wall Gang... ”

122
00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:03,126
That's me!

123
00:13:03,398 --> 00:13:05,662
You want Harvey to do your planning?

124
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,665
Want him to do your thinking for you?

125
00:13:08,904 --> 00:13:10,668
You want him to run things?

126
00:13:10,907 --> 00:13:12,568
Shut up now, News.

127
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:15,074
Not till I get to the good part.

128
00:13:15,313 --> 00:13:17,577
Also known to have
participated in the holdup

129
00:13:17,848 --> 00:13:20,113
are Flat Nose Curry and News Carver.

130
00:13:20,319 --> 00:13:23,414
I just love to read my
name in the paper, Butch.

131
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:26,455
So we just forget
about Logan taking over,

132
00:13:26,694 --> 00:13:27,661
O.K., Flat Nose?

133
00:13:27,895 --> 00:13:29,157
You always said

134
00:13:29,364 --> 00:13:31,332
that any one of us could challenge you.

135
00:13:31,566 --> 00:13:33,831
'Cause I figured no one would do it.

136
00:13:34,103 --> 00:13:35,297
Figured wrong, Butch.

137
00:13:35,504 --> 00:13:37,496
You guys can't want Logan!

138
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:41,173
At least he's with us.

139
00:13:41,412 --> 00:13:43,676
You been spending a lot of time gone.

140
00:13:43,915 --> 00:13:45,679
Well, that's because
everything's different now.

141
00:13:45,918 --> 00:13:47,180
Guns or knives, Butch?

142
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:49,684
You got to plan more, prepare more.

143
00:13:49,956 --> 00:13:51,116
Guns or knives?

144
00:13:51,324 --> 00:13:52,053
Neither.

145
00:13:52,293 --> 00:13:53,089
Pick!

146
00:13:53,361 --> 00:13:56,388
I don't want to shoot with you, Harvey.

147
00:13:56,632 --> 00:13:58,793
Anything you say, Butch.

148
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:19,316
Maybe there's a way to
make a profit in this.

149
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,925
Bet on Logan.

150
00:14:21,162 --> 00:14:23,927
I would, but who'd bet on you?

151
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,155
Sundance...

152
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:29,333
when we're done and he's dead,

153
00:14:29,572 --> 00:14:31,666
you're welcome to stay.

154
00:14:31,942 --> 00:14:34,207
I don't mean to be a sore loser,

155
00:14:34,413 --> 00:14:37,075
but when it's done,
if I'm dead, kill him.

156
00:14:37,349 --> 00:14:38,578
Love to.

157
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:49,392
No, no. Not yet.

158
00:14:49,632 --> 00:14:51,224
Not until me and Harvey

159
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:52,992
get the rules straightened out.

160
00:14:53,236 --> 00:14:55,397
Rules in a knife fight?

161
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:57,301
No rules.

162
00:14:57,542 --> 00:14:59,772
If there ain't any
rules, let's get started.

163
00:15:00,011 --> 00:15:01,707
Someone count 1, 2, 3, go.

164
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,708
1, 2, 3, go.

165
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,785
I was really rooting for you, Butch.

166
00:15:10,024 --> 00:15:11,582
Well, thank you, Flat Nose.

167
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:14,990
That's what sustained
me in my time of trouble.

168
00:15:16,532 --> 00:15:18,796
<i>Hey, what's this about the Flyer?</i>

169
00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:20,331
Harvey said we'd hit it

170
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:22,334
both this run and the return.

171
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:24,838
<i>Nobody's done that to the Flyer before.</i>

172
00:15:25,076 --> 00:15:27,341
No matter how much we got at first,

173
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,605
they'd figure the return was safe

174
00:15:29,882 --> 00:15:31,373
and load it up with money.

175
00:15:31,585 --> 00:15:32,847
Harvey thought of that?

176
00:15:33,086 --> 00:15:34,348
Yes, sir, he did.

177
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:36,352
I'll tell you something, fellas.

178
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:37,250
That's exactly what we're going to do.

179
00:16:15,907 --> 00:16:16,772
Stop it.

180
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,670
Where?

181
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:21,176
Up ahead there.

182
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,348
Bet that's old Butch himself.

183
00:16:30,926 --> 00:16:32,224
Hold it there.

184
00:16:33,963 --> 00:16:35,226
Just thought I'd watch.

185
00:16:35,466 --> 00:16:37,730
Bring the kids, why don't you?

186
00:16:38,001 --> 00:16:39,264
Stick your heads in.

187
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:42,771
You're just going to
get yourself blown up

188
00:16:43,042 --> 00:16:44,805
you don't open that door.

189
00:16:45,044 --> 00:16:47,809
I can't do that. I work
for Mr. E.H. Harriman

190
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,811
of the Union Pacific Railroad. He...

191
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,814
Shut up about that E.H. Harriman stuff

192
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:52,815
and open up.

193
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,317
What's going on?

194
00:16:54,523 --> 00:16:56,286
We got a patriot in there.

195
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,322
That's young Woodcock.
He's awful dedicated.

196
00:16:58,561 --> 00:16:59,323
Woodcock?

197
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:00,258
Yes, sir.

198
00:17:00,497 --> 00:17:02,466
You know who we are?

199
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:05,497
You're the Hole-In-The-Wall
Gang, Mr. Cassidy.

200
00:17:05,737 --> 00:17:06,999
I understand that,

201
00:17:07,205 --> 00:17:11,006
but Mr. E.H. Harriman
himself give me this job.

202
00:17:11,277 --> 00:17:13,040
I got to do my best.

203
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,544
Your best don't include
getting yourself killed.

204
00:17:15,816 --> 00:17:16,714
Dynamite's ready.

205
00:17:16,951 --> 00:17:19,078
Mr. E.H. Harriman himself
had the confidence...

206
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:21,381
Open the door, or that's it.

207
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:22,886
You think E.H. Harriman

208
00:17:23,158 --> 00:17:25,218
would get himself killed for you,

209
00:17:25,428 --> 00:17:26,395
Woodcock?

210
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,895
I work for Mr. E.H. Harriman

211
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,929
of the Union Pacific Railroad,

212
00:17:31,168 --> 00:17:32,568
and he entrusted me...

213
00:17:48,491 --> 00:17:49,253
Hey, Woodcock.

214
00:17:49,492 --> 00:17:51,256
Woodcock, you all right?

215
00:17:51,495 --> 00:17:52,757
Hey.

216
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,520
Hmm?

217
00:17:59,438 --> 00:18:02,032
Whatever Harriman's
paying you ain't enough.

218
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,185
There ain't what I'd call
a fortune in there, Butch.

219
00:18:14,424 --> 00:18:16,688
Well, just so we come out ahead.

220
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,791
That's the main thing.

221
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:19,720
The
Hole-In-The-Wall Gang

222
00:18:19,897 --> 00:18:20,886
The
Hole-In-The-Wall Gang

223
00:18:21,131 --> 00:18:24,898
<i>just robbed the Flyer
right outside of our town,</i>

224
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,435
so that makes it our responsibility

225
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,007
to get out there and get after them.

226
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:32,541
You'll have to bring your own horses.

227
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,772
How many of you can bring your own guns?

228
00:18:38,988 --> 00:18:43,085
How many of you will want
me to supply you with guns?

229
00:18:47,498 --> 00:18:48,466
Well... come on now.

230
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,761
I think it's up to us to
do something, don't you?

231
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:53,471
What's the point?

232
00:18:53,673 --> 00:18:54,765
They're probably halfway

233
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,475
to Hole-In-The-Wall
already.

234
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,941
That's exactly why we have got to hurry.

235
00:18:59,213 --> 00:19:00,909
If we mount up right now

236
00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:02,844
and get out there after them,

237
00:19:03,084 --> 00:19:04,848
maybe we can head them off.

238
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,352
If we did that, they'd kill us.

239
00:19:07,557 --> 00:19:11,324
We don't want to let
them get away with this.

240
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,862
Boy, I just eat this up with a spoon.

241
00:19:16,101 --> 00:19:18,866
All right, youse two,
I want you at my party.

242
00:19:19,105 --> 00:19:19,867
What party?

243
00:19:20,106 --> 00:19:21,869
I'm losing my piano player.

244
00:19:22,109 --> 00:19:24,373
He's going off to fight the war.

245
00:19:24,612 --> 00:19:26,103
What war?

246
00:19:26,348 --> 00:19:28,009
The war with the Spanish.

247
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,219
<i>Remember the Maine.</i>

248
00:19:30,453 --> 00:19:31,715
Who can forget it?

249
00:19:31,988 --> 00:19:34,583
I'm giving him a send-off. so come on.

250
00:19:43,936 --> 00:19:44,869
Goodbye, Dolly

251
00:19:45,105 --> 00:19:46,367
I must leave you...

252
00:19:46,606 --> 00:19:48,369
When I was a kid,

253
00:19:48,608 --> 00:19:51,271
I always thought I would grow up

254
00:19:51,512 --> 00:19:52,673
to be a hero.

255
00:19:52,915 --> 00:19:54,177
It's too late now.

256
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,885
Why'd you say something like that?

257
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,315
You didn't have to say
something like that.

258
00:19:59,556 --> 00:20:01,320
You want me to go alone

259
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:03,824
and fight the
Hole-In-The-Wall Gang?

260
00:20:04,096 --> 00:20:05,358
That's fine with me.

261
00:20:05,564 --> 00:20:08,329
If you want your kids
to know you let me,

262
00:20:08,568 --> 00:20:10,126
<i>that's fine with me,</i>

263
00:20:10,403 --> 00:20:13,805
but I don't think that's what you want.

264
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,133
Is it?

265
00:20:19,949 --> 00:20:22,213
Why don't we enlist,
go fight the Spanish?

266
00:20:22,451 --> 00:20:24,215
You and me in the war.

267
00:20:24,454 --> 00:20:27,219
We got a lot of things going for us...

268
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:28,720
experience, maturity, leadership.

269
00:20:28,993 --> 00:20:31,258
I'll bet we end up officers.

270
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:33,488
I'd be Major Parker.

271
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:37,192
Parker?

272
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,269
Yeah. That's my real name.

273
00:20:41,342 --> 00:20:42,605
Robert Leroy Parker.

274
00:20:42,844 --> 00:20:44,106
No fooling?

275
00:20:44,346 --> 00:20:45,404
No.

276
00:20:50,154 --> 00:20:51,143
Mine's Longbaugh.

277
00:20:51,388 --> 00:20:52,821
No fooling.

278
00:20:53,056 --> 00:20:54,388
Long what?

279
00:20:54,626 --> 00:20:56,423
Harry Longbaugh.

280
00:20:56,661 --> 00:20:58,425
So you'd be Major Longbaugh.

281
00:20:58,664 --> 00:20:59,858
What do you say?

282
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:06,302
You just keep thinking, Butch.

283
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,304
That's what you're good at.

284
00:21:08,544 --> 00:21:09,806
<i>But you're not frightened.</i>

285
00:21:10,078 --> 00:21:10,840
<i>No, sir.</i>

286
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:12,843
<i>You have got respect for me,</i>

287
00:21:13,082 --> 00:21:15,312
<i>and I have got respect for you.</i>

288
00:21:15,518 --> 00:21:18,317
That's why you and you and you

289
00:21:18,556 --> 00:21:20,354
are riding with me. Am I right?

290
00:21:22,561 --> 00:21:24,962
Well, what do you say?

291
00:21:25,198 --> 00:21:27,063
I say this.

292
00:21:27,301 --> 00:21:31,032
I say, ladies and gentlemen,

293
00:21:31,272 --> 00:21:33,365
boys and girls, friends and enemies,

294
00:21:33,608 --> 00:21:34,870
meet the future!

295
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,372
The future what?

296
00:21:36,612 --> 00:21:38,375
The future mode of transportation

297
00:21:38,614 --> 00:21:40,640
for this weary Western world.

298
00:21:40,917 --> 00:21:44,183
Now, I'm not going to make
a lot of extravagant claims.

299
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:47,153
Sure, it'll change your
whole life for the better,

300
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,654
but that's all.

301
00:21:48,927 --> 00:21:51,192
What the hell do you think you're doing?

302
00:21:51,431 --> 00:21:52,693
You got the crowd together,

303
00:21:52,932 --> 00:21:55,197
so I thought I'd do a little selling.

304
00:21:55,436 --> 00:21:57,701
I'm trying to raise a posse here.

305
00:21:57,939 --> 00:21:59,201
A short presentation.

306
00:21:59,441 --> 00:22:00,635
The horse is dead.

307
00:22:00,876 --> 00:22:02,469
This item sells itself.

308
00:22:02,712 --> 00:22:05,978
<i>Are you going to listen
to him or come with me?</i>

309
00:22:06,216 --> 00:22:08,980
Butch, Fanny says to come into her party

310
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,016
right now.

311
00:22:10,255 --> 00:22:13,521
<i>No oats, no mess, no kicks, no bites,</i>

312
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:16,023
<i>no running away, no
stepping on your foot.</i>

313
00:22:16,262 --> 00:22:19,027
Well, I think I'll get saddled up

314
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:21,894
and go looking for a woman.

315
00:22:22,136 --> 00:22:24,001
Good hunting.

316
00:22:26,108 --> 00:22:29,237
Shouldn't take more
than a couple of days.

317
00:22:33,617 --> 00:22:34,914
I'm not picky...

318
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,384
as long as she's smart,

319
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,091
pretty...

320
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:41,657
sweet...

321
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,222
gentle, and...

322
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:48,560
tender and refined...

323
00:22:50,338 --> 00:22:51,397
lovely...

324
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,106
carefree.

325
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:58,388
Aah!

326
00:24:01,328 --> 00:24:03,320
Keep going, teacher lady.

327
00:24:11,107 --> 00:24:13,667
It's O.K. Don't mind me. Keep on going.

328
00:24:41,345 --> 00:24:43,245
Let down your hair.

329
00:24:55,463 --> 00:24:56,954
Shake your head.

330
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:08,545
Do you know what I wish?

331
00:26:08,756 --> 00:26:11,520
That once you'd get here on time.

332
00:26:14,629 --> 00:26:17,428
You are mine, Etta Place.

333
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,464
Mine.

334
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,965
You hear me?

335
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:22,536
Mine.

336
00:26:22,773 --> 00:26:24,571
All mine.

337
00:26:28,347 --> 00:26:31,249
Your soft white flesh is mine.

338
00:26:31,484 --> 00:26:32,610
Soft...

339
00:26:32,886 --> 00:26:34,319
white...

340
00:26:34,521 --> 00:26:36,581
bwhaa!

341
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,962
Meet the future.

342
00:26:46,337 --> 00:26:48,601
Do you know what you're doing?

343
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:49,601
Theoretically.

344
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:50,899
Aah!

345
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:52,632
Don't ever hit your mother with a shovel

346
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:56,143
It leaves a dull impression on her mind

347
00:27:00,254 --> 00:27:02,951
Raindrops keep fallin' on my head

348
00:27:04,225 --> 00:27:06,023
And just like the guy

349
00:27:06,262 --> 00:27:09,562
Whose feet are too big for his bed

350
00:27:09,766 --> 00:27:11,529
Nothin' seems to fit

351
00:27:11,768 --> 00:27:15,865
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head

352
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,075
They keep fallin'

353
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:23,840
So I just did me some talkin' to the sun

354
00:27:24,084 --> 00:27:29,250
And I said I didn't like
the way he got things done

355
00:27:29,491 --> 00:27:31,288
Sleepin' on the job

356
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,429
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head

357
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:37,156
They keep fallin'

358
00:27:37,434 --> 00:27:40,962
But there's one thing

359
00:27:41,205 --> 00:27:42,797
I know

360
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:46,911
The blues they sent to meet me

361
00:27:47,147 --> 00:27:49,945
Won't defeat me

362
00:27:50,216 --> 00:27:51,946
It won't be long

363
00:27:52,186 --> 00:27:53,915
Till happiness

364
00:27:54,155 --> 00:27:57,319
Steps up to greet me

365
00:28:01,464 --> 00:28:04,263
Raindrops keep fallin' on my head

366
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:07,195
But that doesn't mean

367
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:10,773
My eyes will soon be turnin' red

368
00:28:11,043 --> 00:28:13,034
Cryin's not for me

369
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:17,046
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain

370
00:28:17,318 --> 00:28:19,343
By complainin'

371
00:28:19,587 --> 00:28:23,319
Because I'm free

372
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:26,586
Nothin's worryin' me

373
00:29:38,353 --> 00:29:40,720
Raindrops are fallin' on my head

374
00:29:42,058 --> 00:29:43,958
But that doesn't mean

375
00:29:44,194 --> 00:29:47,494
My eyes will soon be turnin' red

376
00:29:47,698 --> 00:29:49,599
Cryin's not for me

377
00:29:49,835 --> 00:29:54,102
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain

378
00:29:54,373 --> 00:29:56,433
By complainin'

379
00:29:56,643 --> 00:30:00,876
Because I'm free

380
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:07,249
Nothin's worryin' me

381
00:30:09,092 --> 00:30:11,357
<i>You've come to get him for the Flyer?</i>

382
00:30:11,596 --> 00:30:13,359
Would you believe I'm broke already?

383
00:30:13,598 --> 00:30:15,863
Why is there never any money, Butch?

384
00:30:16,134 --> 00:30:17,897
I swear, Etta, I don't know.

385
00:30:18,136 --> 00:30:20,901
I've been working
like a dog all my life,

386
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,905
and I can't get a penny ahead.

387
00:30:24,144 --> 00:30:26,409
Sundance says it's
because you're a soft touch

388
00:30:26,615 --> 00:30:28,378
and always taking expensive vacations,

389
00:30:28,617 --> 00:30:29,880
buying drinks for everyone,

390
00:30:30,152 --> 00:30:31,915
and you're a rotten gambler.

391
00:30:32,154 --> 00:30:34,419
That might have something to do with it.

392
00:30:48,775 --> 00:30:49,538
Butch.

393
00:30:49,777 --> 00:30:50,573
Hmm?

394
00:30:50,811 --> 00:30:53,042
Do you ever wonder if I'd met you first

395
00:30:53,315 --> 00:30:55,545
we'd been the ones to get involved?

396
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:58,550
We are involved, Etta.
Don't you know that?

397
00:31:00,724 --> 00:31:02,487
You are riding on my bicycle.

398
00:31:02,726 --> 00:31:03,920
In some Arabian countries,

399
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,958
that's the same as being married.

400
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:12,596
Hey.

401
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,966
What are you doing?

402
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:16,471
Stealing your woman.

403
00:31:20,082 --> 00:31:20,844
Take her.

404
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:22,311
Take her.

405
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,744
Well, you're a romantic bastard.

406
00:31:25,722 --> 00:31:27,122
I'll give you that.

407
00:31:27,291 --> 00:31:36,634
I'll give you that.

408
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,533
O.K., open up in there.

409
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:41,036
I work for Mr. E.H. Harriman...

410
00:31:41,308 --> 00:31:42,571
Hey, Woodcock!

411
00:31:42,777 --> 00:31:44,039
Butch?

412
00:31:44,312 --> 00:31:45,210
You O.K.?

413
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:46,710
Uh, well, sort of.

414
00:31:46,916 --> 00:31:49,681
Hey, that's wonderful.
Let's take a look at you.

415
00:31:51,154 --> 00:31:52,416
Well, now, Butch,

416
00:31:52,656 --> 00:31:54,921
you've got to have more respect for me

417
00:31:55,159 --> 00:31:57,924
than to think I'd fall
for a stunt like that.

418
00:32:01,134 --> 00:32:03,534
You can't want to get blown up again?

419
00:32:03,737 --> 00:32:06,502
Uh, Butch, you know if it were my money,

420
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:09,006
there's nobody I'd rather have steal it

421
00:32:09,277 --> 00:32:10,039
than you.

422
00:32:10,278 --> 00:32:12,041
But I'm still in the employ

423
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,543
of Mr. E.H. Harriman

424
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,513
of the Union Pacific Railroad.

425
00:32:15,752 --> 00:32:16,981
Start this train!

426
00:32:17,254 --> 00:32:18,516
Get back inside, lady.

427
00:32:18,722 --> 00:32:19,985
I'm not afraid of you.

428
00:32:20,258 --> 00:32:21,520
I'm not afraid of anything.

429
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,523
I'm a grandmother and a female,

430
00:32:23,763 --> 00:32:25,025
and I've got my rights.

431
00:32:25,264 --> 00:32:27,027
We got no time for this.

432
00:32:27,266 --> 00:32:29,531
You can bull the others, but not me.

433
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:32,035
I've fought whiskey, and
I've fought gambling...

434
00:32:32,273 --> 00:32:34,434
We got no time for this.

435
00:32:34,676 --> 00:32:36,941
What are you doing? Let go!

436
00:32:37,212 --> 00:32:39,477
What are you going to do to her?

437
00:32:39,683 --> 00:32:40,945
Well, leave her alone.

438
00:32:41,217 --> 00:32:42,479
You're after the money,

439
00:32:42,687 --> 00:32:43,949
and the money's in here.

440
00:32:44,221 --> 00:32:45,483
Please! All I want

441
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,454
is for somebody to start this train.

442
00:32:47,693 --> 00:32:48,455
Somebody, please!

443
00:32:48,694 --> 00:32:49,956
Open the door, Woodcock,

444
00:32:50,229 --> 00:32:51,491
or tell her goodbye.

445
00:32:51,731 --> 00:32:53,995
Our Father, who art in heaven,

446
00:32:54,234 --> 00:32:55,997
hallowed be Thy name,

447
00:32:56,236 --> 00:32:58,000
Thy kingdom come,

448
00:32:58,239 --> 00:32:59,934
Thy will be done,

449
00:33:00,175 --> 00:33:02,872
on earth as it is in heaven.

450
00:33:03,112 --> 00:33:05,877
What am I going to
tell poor Mr. Harriman?

451
00:33:08,218 --> 00:33:10,983
Woodcock, what'd you have to go and do

452
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:12,517
something like that for?

453
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:15,319
Well, Butch, you blew
the last one so easy,

454
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:17,496
I just had to, um, do something.

455
00:33:17,731 --> 00:33:20,495
Give me that and get some more,

456
00:33:20,735 --> 00:33:21,929
a lot more!

457
00:33:23,904 --> 00:33:25,770
Well, that ought to do it.

458
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:48,898
Think you used enough
dynamite there, Butch?

459
00:33:52,174 --> 00:33:54,165
Ha ha ha ha.

460
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,141
What the hell is that?

461
00:35:09,238 --> 00:35:11,434
Whatever they're
selling, I don't want it.

462
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:23,646
Will you leave it?

463
00:35:29,597 --> 00:35:30,359
Come on!

464
00:35:30,598 --> 00:35:31,530
Hyah!

465
00:35:50,056 --> 00:35:50,818
Hey, Butch!

466
00:35:51,057 --> 00:35:51,955
What?

467
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,420
They're very good!

468
00:35:55,996 --> 00:35:57,430
Split up!

469
00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:12,346
How many of'em are following us?

470
00:36:12,584 --> 00:36:13,846
All of'em.

471
00:36:14,086 --> 00:36:15,179
All of'em?

472
00:36:15,422 --> 00:36:18,016
What's the matter with those guys?

473
00:36:18,258 --> 00:36:19,726
Hyah!

474
00:37:47,604 --> 00:37:50,938
I think we lost 'em. Do
you think we lost 'em?

475
00:37:51,176 --> 00:37:52,837
No.

476
00:37:53,078 --> 00:37:55,013
Neither do I. Hyah!

477
00:38:11,568 --> 00:38:13,730
Take our horses out back. Feed 'em good.

478
00:38:13,938 --> 00:38:14,700
Where's Sweetface?

479
00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:16,201
Just inside. Trouble?

480
00:38:16,474 --> 00:38:17,237
Listen, you dirty old man,

481
00:38:17,476 --> 00:38:19,239
I know you're a lying thief

482
00:38:19,478 --> 00:38:20,741
and so do you,

483
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:23,244
but who'd know it to look at you?

484
00:38:23,483 --> 00:38:24,746
Get yourself out front fast.

485
00:38:24,985 --> 00:38:26,247
You seen us ride through

486
00:38:26,487 --> 00:38:27,749
not five minutes ago.

487
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:29,251
Do this right,

488
00:38:29,491 --> 00:38:31,254
I'll get you an old dog to kick.

489
00:38:31,493 --> 00:38:33,758
Here, room 9. Top of the stairs.

490
00:38:47,714 --> 00:38:49,978
Hey, you realize you're driving me crazy

491
00:38:50,216 --> 00:38:51,980
staring out the window like that?

492
00:38:52,219 --> 00:38:54,278
I swear, Sweetface can handle it, easy.

493
00:38:54,523 --> 00:38:56,286
He wouldn't dare louse me up.

494
00:38:56,525 --> 00:38:58,790
He's that scared of me.

495
00:39:04,034 --> 00:39:06,697
Hey, kid, how can I give Agnes

496
00:39:06,905 --> 00:39:08,167
the concentration she deserves

497
00:39:08,439 --> 00:39:11,204
with you staring out
the window like that?

498
00:39:11,443 --> 00:39:12,705
Butch, you're really something,

499
00:39:12,912 --> 00:39:14,312
you know that?

500
00:39:14,581 --> 00:39:16,879
Could you be a little more specific

501
00:39:17,117 --> 00:39:18,210
about that, Agnes?

502
00:39:19,453 --> 00:39:20,215
Butch!

503
00:39:26,963 --> 00:39:29,728
O.K., Sweetface, give them a nice smile.

504
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:31,229
Come on.

505
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:34,733
That's a nice touch.

506
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:36,737
<i>I swear, if he told me</i>

507
00:39:36,976 --> 00:39:39,240
I rode out of town 10 minutes ago,

508
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:40,571
I'd believe him.

509
00:39:42,516 --> 00:39:44,178
And there they go.

510
00:39:52,996 --> 00:39:54,258
No, no.

511
00:39:54,531 --> 00:39:56,295
Don't ask me to stay.

512
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,809
You're the only real man I ever met.

513
00:40:07,047 --> 00:40:08,810
You know that, Butch?

514
00:40:09,049 --> 00:40:11,314
It's not just 'cause of all that money

515
00:40:11,553 --> 00:40:14,318
you got to spend on people. It's you.

516
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:15,852
The way you're always

517
00:40:16,058 --> 00:40:18,323
looking to see am I happy or not?

518
00:40:18,595 --> 00:40:20,358
A lot of the other girls,

519
00:40:20,597 --> 00:40:22,361
they... they might want you

520
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,864
for when you got lots of money

521
00:40:25,069 --> 00:40:25,832
to spend on people.

522
00:40:26,071 --> 00:40:28,835
Me, I... I don't care about...

523
00:40:29,074 --> 00:40:32,340
clothes and money and jewels...

524
00:40:33,614 --> 00:40:35,878
and furs,

525
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,914
and things like that.

526
00:40:38,153 --> 00:40:40,417
Lots of the other girls do,

527
00:40:40,622 --> 00:40:41,885
but I never did.

528
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:44,422
I always said, Agnes... ”

529
00:41:02,617 --> 00:41:05,086
Don't move.

530
00:41:05,321 --> 00:41:06,310
Stand up.

531
00:41:06,555 --> 00:41:08,319
Put your hands up.

532
00:41:08,558 --> 00:41:09,490
Higher.

533
00:41:11,562 --> 00:41:13,325
Now turn around and start...

534
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:21,472
Get our horses and come on back here.

535
00:41:29,617 --> 00:41:30,380
Hyah!

536
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:32,712
Get out of here!

537
00:41:32,922 --> 00:41:33,786
Get out!

538
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:38,357
Go on!

539
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,893
Get out of here, you fat-headed beast!

540
00:41:42,634 --> 00:41:43,498
Come on!

541
00:41:43,736 --> 00:41:46,467
You're the fat-headed
beast. Quit shouting!

542
00:41:46,706 --> 00:41:48,833
Boy, somebody sure trained 'em.

543
00:42:18,479 --> 00:42:19,447
Which way?

544
00:42:19,681 --> 00:42:21,581
Well, it doesn't matter.

545
00:42:21,817 --> 00:42:23,581
I don't know where we've been,

546
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,082
and I've just been there.

547
00:42:25,355 --> 00:42:26,948
They can't follow us. We're safe.

548
00:42:27,191 --> 00:42:28,215
You really think so?

549
00:42:28,459 --> 00:42:30,188
I will if you will.

550
00:42:59,665 --> 00:43:02,794
How long you
figure we've been watching?

551
00:43:03,036 --> 00:43:04,697
Oh, a while.

552
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:21,321
How long before you figure
they're not after us?

553
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:22,856
A while longer.

554
00:43:25,598 --> 00:43:27,589
How come you're so talkative?

555
00:43:29,436 --> 00:43:31,598
Just naturally blabby, I guess.

556
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:37,307
Ohh! I haven't done so much riding

557
00:43:37,579 --> 00:43:38,841
since I quit rustling.

558
00:43:39,048 --> 00:43:40,811
That's a miserable occupation.

559
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:43,849
Dusk to dawn, no sleep, rotten food.

560
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,424
Hey.

561
00:43:50,663 --> 00:43:51,960
I see it.

562
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,434
Torches you think?

563
00:43:58,673 --> 00:43:59,867
Yeah, maybe.

564
00:44:00,141 --> 00:44:01,403
Maybe lanterns.

565
00:44:02,611 --> 00:44:04,306
They're following our path.

566
00:44:06,049 --> 00:44:08,279
Dead on it.

567
00:44:08,552 --> 00:44:10,817
I couldn't do that. Could you do that?

568
00:44:11,022 --> 00:44:12,785
How can they do that?

569
00:44:14,226 --> 00:44:15,853
Who are those guys?

570
00:44:28,411 --> 00:44:30,174
You sure this'll work?

571
00:44:30,413 --> 00:44:31,175
It'll work.

572
00:44:31,414 --> 00:44:33,178
That's what you said about Sweetface.

573
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:34,679
This'll work.

574
00:44:58,681 --> 00:45:00,377
Once they divide up,

575
00:45:00,618 --> 00:45:03,315
we take them, no trouble, right?

576
00:45:03,555 --> 00:45:04,783
Maybe.

577
00:45:05,023 --> 00:45:06,286
Boy, for a gunman,

578
00:45:06,525 --> 00:45:08,322
you're one hell of a pessimist.

579
00:45:09,562 --> 00:45:10,825
They ought to get

580
00:45:11,064 --> 00:45:15,661
to where we split up any time.

581
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,632
They're just about there.

582
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:24,340
How many of them do you
think will come our way?

583
00:45:24,581 --> 00:45:26,345
Oh, I wish we had rifles.

584
00:45:26,584 --> 00:45:28,245
I mean, they got rifles.

585
00:45:28,486 --> 00:45:30,751
But we got surprise on our side, right?

586
00:45:36,496 --> 00:45:38,988
So far, they're doing what we want.

587
00:45:43,505 --> 00:45:46,270
You think we ought to
take them from up here?

588
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:54,313
Kid, look, you know this
work better than I do.

589
00:45:54,552 --> 00:45:55,815
Is it best here,

590
00:45:56,021 --> 00:45:58,114
or maybe down there,
closer to the trail?

591
00:46:00,694 --> 00:46:02,025
Uh...

592
00:46:04,331 --> 00:46:05,263
Damn it!

593
00:46:08,437 --> 00:46:11,202
They're not going for it.

594
00:46:13,443 --> 00:46:15,469
Who are those guys?

595
00:46:15,713 --> 00:46:18,478
I don't know.

596
00:46:18,717 --> 00:46:19,706
I don't know.

597
00:46:19,951 --> 00:46:22,216
We got to do something and shake them.

598
00:46:22,455 --> 00:46:24,218
Whatever you come up with

599
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,752
is fine with me,

600
00:46:25,959 --> 00:46:28,223
but whatever it is, it better be now!

601
00:46:39,943 --> 00:46:41,707
What are you doing here?

602
00:46:41,979 --> 00:46:43,241
Easy, Ray. Easy.

603
00:46:43,481 --> 00:46:46,246
What the hell do you mean, take it easy?

604
00:46:46,485 --> 00:46:48,646
You promised you'd never
come into my territory.

605
00:46:48,888 --> 00:46:49,650
And we haven't.

606
00:46:49,889 --> 00:46:51,151
Just because we were friendly

607
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:53,655
doesn't give you the right to break in.

608
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,361
What if we was seen together?

609
00:46:55,596 --> 00:46:58,361
I'm too old to find another job.

610
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,229
At least have the
decency to draw your guns.

611
00:47:01,504 --> 00:47:03,768
Listen, Butch is trying
to tell you something.

612
00:47:03,974 --> 00:47:06,238
All right. What do you want?

613
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:07,773
A couple of things.

614
00:47:07,979 --> 00:47:09,742
We want to enlist, Ray.

615
00:47:09,981 --> 00:47:11,677
In the army. Right away.

616
00:47:11,917 --> 00:47:13,407
Go fight the Spanish.

617
00:47:18,725 --> 00:47:20,990
Oh, you're crazy. You are crazy.

618
00:47:21,228 --> 00:47:23,493
You are, both of you, crazy!

619
00:47:23,732 --> 00:47:27,999
They'd throw you in jail
for a thousand years each.

620
00:47:33,477 --> 00:47:36,538
Come on, Sundance.
Start trussing my feet.

621
00:47:39,051 --> 00:47:41,315
Here. You seen these before. Come on!

622
00:47:41,587 --> 00:47:43,351
I'm not taking the chance

623
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:45,285
that someone saw you coming in.

624
00:47:45,525 --> 00:47:46,788
We're serious about this.

625
00:47:46,994 --> 00:47:48,256
You are known outlaws.

626
00:47:48,529 --> 00:47:49,291
We'd quit.

627
00:47:49,531 --> 00:47:51,795
That's the point. Is that on tight?

628
00:47:52,034 --> 00:47:52,796
That's all right.

629
00:47:53,035 --> 00:47:54,799
There's some hankies in the drawer

630
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,801
you can use to gag me.

631
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:58,508
I swear, this'd work, Ray.

632
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:00,938
You trust us. The government trusts you.

633
00:48:01,213 --> 00:48:03,204
Anything you tell them
they gotta believe, right?

634
00:48:03,448 --> 00:48:06,213
You've never done a
dishonest thing ever,

635
00:48:06,452 --> 00:48:08,215
and you're pushing 60. We'd quit.

636
00:48:08,455 --> 00:48:10,218
They'd drop the charges against us,

637
00:48:10,457 --> 00:48:12,221
we'd fight till the war is over.

638
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,690
They don't even have
to make us officers.

639
00:48:14,896 --> 00:48:15,989
That's some proposition.

640
00:48:16,265 --> 00:48:17,892
They forget all about the years

641
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,192
of thieving and robbing.

642
00:48:19,468 --> 00:48:21,061
They take you into the army,

643
00:48:21,304 --> 00:48:25,332
which is what you want
in the first place.

644
00:48:25,576 --> 00:48:26,838
There's something out there

645
00:48:27,078 --> 00:48:29,070
that scares you, huh?

646
00:48:30,983 --> 00:48:32,246
But it's too late.

647
00:48:32,485 --> 00:48:34,248
You should've let yourself get killed

648
00:48:34,487 --> 00:48:36,217
while you had the chance.

649
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:39,756
You may be the biggest
thing to hit this area,

650
00:48:39,961 --> 00:48:42,225
but you're still two-bit outlaws.

651
00:48:42,497 --> 00:48:45,763
I never met a soul more
affable than you, Butch,

652
00:48:45,968 --> 00:48:47,231
or faster than the Kid.

653
00:48:47,504 --> 00:48:49,267
But you're still two-bit outlaws

654
00:48:49,506 --> 00:48:50,269
on the dodge.

655
00:48:50,508 --> 00:48:52,567
It's over! Don't you get that?

656
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:54,073
Your times is over,

657
00:48:54,313 --> 00:48:56,076
and you're gonna die bloody,

658
00:48:56,315 --> 00:48:59,251
and all you can do is choose where.

659
00:48:59,486 --> 00:49:00,180
I'm sorry,

660
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:03,015
I'm getting mean in my old age.

661
00:49:03,257 --> 00:49:04,656
Come on. Shut me up, Sundance.

662
00:51:25,871 --> 00:51:27,998
Ah, you're wasting your time.

663
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,505
They can't track us over rock.

664
00:51:30,777 --> 00:51:32,039
Tell them that.

665
00:51:58,378 --> 00:52:00,574
They're beginning to get on my nerves.

666
00:52:02,316 --> 00:52:04,251
Who are those guys?

667
00:52:06,455 --> 00:52:07,718
You remember the time

668
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:10,188
you, me, and Etta went to Denver

669
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,223
for a vacation?

670
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:13,726
I'm glad you brought that up, Kid.

671
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,229
That's an important topic,
considering our situation.

672
00:52:16,468 --> 00:52:18,231
The night we went gambling, remember?

673
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:20,234
We had dinner at the hotel.

674
00:52:20,473 --> 00:52:22,738
Etta had roast beef, and I had chicken.

675
00:52:22,976 --> 00:52:24,739
If I can remember what you had,

676
00:52:24,978 --> 00:52:26,036
I'll die happy.

677
00:52:26,313 --> 00:52:27,076
Look out there.

678
00:52:27,315 --> 00:52:28,612
What?

679
00:52:28,816 --> 00:52:31,342
I got to talking to
some gambler that night.

680
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:33,383
He told us about an Indian...

681
00:52:33,622 --> 00:52:34,590
full-blooded Indian,

682
00:52:34,791 --> 00:52:36,349
except he used an English name,

683
00:52:36,626 --> 00:52:38,254
Sir... somebody.

684
00:52:38,496 --> 00:52:39,292
Lord Baltimore?

685
00:52:39,564 --> 00:52:42,329
That's right, and he could track anybody

686
00:52:42,568 --> 00:52:44,433
over anything day or night.

687
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:46,434
So?

688
00:52:46,673 --> 00:52:49,700
The guy on the ground, I think it's him.

689
00:52:55,183 --> 00:52:56,947
No. Baltimore works out of Oklahoma.

690
00:52:57,186 --> 00:52:58,653
He's strictly an Oklahoma man.

691
00:52:58,888 --> 00:53:01,084
I don't know where we are,

692
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:02,620
but it isn't Oklahoma.

693
00:53:02,826 --> 00:53:04,522
Ah, it couldn't be him.

694
00:53:09,802 --> 00:53:11,201
It couldn't be him.

695
00:53:13,073 --> 00:53:14,062
I guess.

696
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:17,873
Whoever it is,

697
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,742
it sure the hell is somebody.

698
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:51,780
Damn it!

699
00:53:51,988 --> 00:53:55,254
Don't they get tired?
Don't they get hungry?

700
00:53:55,526 --> 00:53:56,788
They've gotta be.

701
00:53:57,028 --> 00:53:58,496
Why don't they slow up?

702
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:00,129
They could even go faster.

703
00:54:00,365 --> 00:54:02,231
At least that'd be a change.

704
00:54:02,468 --> 00:54:04,163
They don't even break formation.

705
00:54:04,404 --> 00:54:05,167
Do something!

706
00:54:39,916 --> 00:54:41,406
Kid.

707
00:54:41,651 --> 00:54:43,279
What?

708
00:54:43,554 --> 00:54:44,919
Who's the best lawman?

709
00:54:47,058 --> 00:54:47,854
Best? How?

710
00:54:48,093 --> 00:54:51,086
You mean toughest or easiest to bribe?

711
00:54:51,364 --> 00:54:53,457
Toughest.

712
00:54:53,699 --> 00:54:56,464
Joe LeFors.

713
00:54:56,703 --> 00:54:58,467
Gotta be.

714
00:55:02,745 --> 00:55:04,940
LeFors never leaves Wyoming. Never.

715
00:55:05,147 --> 00:55:06,877
You know that.

716
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:08,913
He always wears a white skimmer.

717
00:55:09,152 --> 00:55:11,246
That's how you tell it's Joe LeFors,

718
00:55:11,489 --> 00:55:14,584
'cause he wears a white straw hat.

719
00:55:14,826 --> 00:55:18,354
Look at that guy out front.

720
00:55:37,555 --> 00:55:39,785
Jesus, who are those guys?

721
00:55:44,898 --> 00:55:45,660
Hyah!

722
00:55:45,899 --> 00:55:47,457
Come on now.

723
00:55:47,701 --> 00:55:49,225
Here you go, Kid.

724
00:56:33,526 --> 00:56:35,790
Go on! Get out of here! Go on!

725
00:56:37,364 --> 00:56:39,457
What if they don't follow the horse?

726
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:40,861
You're the brains, Butch.

727
00:56:41,069 --> 00:56:43,162
You'll think of something.

728
00:58:10,181 --> 00:58:11,375
Damn it!

729
00:58:26,001 --> 00:58:27,264
The way I figure it,

730
00:58:27,503 --> 00:58:29,232
we can either fight or give.

731
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:31,236
If we give, we go to jail.

732
00:58:31,475 --> 00:58:32,601
I've been there already.

733
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:33,935
If we fight,

734
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,611
they can stay where they are

735
00:58:35,847 --> 00:58:37,007
and starve us out...

736
00:58:37,248 --> 00:58:39,308
or go for position, shoot us.

737
00:58:39,585 --> 00:58:41,678
Might even get a rock slide started.

738
00:58:41,887 --> 00:58:43,355
What else can they do?

739
00:58:43,623 --> 00:58:45,090
They could surrender to us,

740
00:58:45,291 --> 00:58:47,556
but I wouldn't count on that.

741
00:58:47,828 --> 00:58:49,523
They're going for position, all right.

742
00:58:49,765 --> 00:58:52,632
Better get ready.

743
00:58:55,938 --> 00:58:57,702
Kid, the next time I say

744
00:58:57,941 --> 00:58:59,704
let's go someplace like Bolivia,

745
00:58:59,943 --> 00:59:01,138
let's go someplace like Bolivia.

746
00:59:01,379 --> 00:59:02,505
Next time.

747
00:59:04,482 --> 00:59:05,472
Ready?

748
00:59:07,787 --> 00:59:09,085
No. We'll jump.

749
00:59:13,961 --> 00:59:15,451
Like hell we will.

750
00:59:15,697 --> 00:59:16,960
No. It'll be O.K.

751
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:18,666
if the water's deep enough

752
00:59:18,901 --> 00:59:20,699
and we don't get squished to death.

753
00:59:20,937 --> 00:59:22,097
They'll never follow us.

754
00:59:22,372 --> 00:59:23,430
How do you know?

755
00:59:23,673 --> 00:59:25,938
Would you jump that
if you didn't have to?

756
00:59:26,143 --> 00:59:27,907
I have to, and I'm not gonna.

757
00:59:28,146 --> 00:59:29,909
We got to. Otherwise we're dead.

758
00:59:30,148 --> 00:59:30,944
Come on.

759
00:59:31,183 --> 00:59:33,414
Just one clear shot...
that's all I want.

760
00:59:33,686 --> 00:59:35,450
I want to fight them!

761
00:59:35,689 --> 00:59:36,951
They'll kill us.

762
00:59:37,191 --> 00:59:37,953
Maybe.

763
00:59:38,192 --> 00:59:39,455
You want to die?

764
00:59:39,694 --> 00:59:41,821
Do you?

765
00:59:42,063 --> 00:59:44,157
All right, I'll jump first.

766
00:59:44,433 --> 00:59:45,195
No.

767
00:59:45,434 --> 00:59:46,697
Then you jump first.

768
00:59:46,903 --> 00:59:47,665
No, I said.

769
00:59:47,904 --> 00:59:48,700
What's the matter?

770
00:59:48,972 --> 00:59:50,440
I can't swim!

771
01:00:00,587 --> 01:00:01,850
Why, you crazy?

772
01:00:02,089 --> 01:00:04,353
The fall will probably kill you.

773
01:00:13,704 --> 01:00:15,365
Oh-oh...

774
01:00:15,606 --> 01:00:17,632
ohhh...

775
01:00:17,876 --> 01:00:20,367
shiiiit!

776
01:00:27,854 --> 01:00:29,015
Hang on to me.

777
01:00:29,223 --> 01:00:30,247
You're drowning me!

778
01:00:30,525 --> 01:00:32,221
I can't help it. I can't swim.

779
01:00:32,461 --> 01:00:33,723
You're choking me!

780
01:00:33,962 --> 01:00:35,224
I can't swim!

781
01:00:35,464 --> 01:00:36,557
I'm telling you, if I drown,

782
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,291
I swear to God I'll kill you.

783
01:00:39,536 --> 01:00:41,664
Never said I was a great swimmer.

784
01:00:44,709 --> 01:00:47,474
Oh! You're choking me!

785
01:00:47,713 --> 01:00:50,307
Oh! I'm choking!

786
01:00:50,583 --> 01:00:51,846
Let go of me.

787
01:00:52,052 --> 01:00:54,350
I'm choking!

788
01:00:54,621 --> 01:00:55,589
Let go of my throat.

789
01:01:24,025 --> 01:01:25,823
The papers said they had you.

790
01:01:26,062 --> 01:01:29,089
Was it LeFors? Did they say?

791
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:30,766
Joe LeFors?

792
01:01:31,034 --> 01:01:32,296
I think so.

793
01:01:32,536 --> 01:01:33,799
And their tracker?

794
01:01:34,038 --> 01:01:34,800
Tracker?

795
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:36,301
Was it Lord Baltimore?

796
01:01:36,542 --> 01:01:37,804
I think so.

797
01:01:38,043 --> 01:01:39,305
The paper's inside.

798
01:01:46,254 --> 01:01:48,519
You got enough to feed us?

799
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:51,350
Don't you know I do?

800
01:01:51,593 --> 01:01:53,152
They said you were dead.

801
01:01:53,363 --> 01:01:56,128
Don't make a big thing out of it.

802
01:01:58,836 --> 01:02:01,533
No. Make a big thing out of it.

803
01:02:06,245 --> 01:02:08,009
Hey.

804
01:02:08,248 --> 01:02:11,412
It was Baltimore and LeFors.

805
01:02:20,196 --> 01:02:21,163
You know who else?

806
01:02:21,398 --> 01:02:22,195
Who?

807
01:02:22,466 --> 01:02:23,728
Jeff Carr, George Hiatt...

808
01:02:23,935 --> 01:02:24,697
Hiatt?

809
01:02:24,936 --> 01:02:26,199
T.T. Kelliher.

810
01:02:30,209 --> 01:02:32,541
We lucked out getting away.

811
01:02:32,812 --> 01:02:33,939
You know that?

812
01:02:36,116 --> 01:02:37,482
Why would these guys join up

813
01:02:37,719 --> 01:02:39,084
and take after us, though?

814
01:02:39,287 --> 01:02:41,051
Forget it. Bunch like that

815
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:42,484
won't stay together long.

816
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:43,487
They will...

817
01:02:43,726 --> 01:02:45,922
if Mr. Harriman has his way.

818
01:02:46,163 --> 01:02:46,925
Who?

819
01:02:47,164 --> 01:02:48,062
Mr. E.H. Harriman

820
01:02:48,298 --> 01:02:49,493
of the Union Pacific Railroad.

821
01:02:49,734 --> 01:02:52,499
He resents the way you've
been picking on him,

822
01:02:52,738 --> 01:02:54,501
so he's outfitted a special train

823
01:02:54,773 --> 01:02:56,537
and hired special employees.

824
01:02:56,776 --> 01:02:58,539
You've been avoiding them for two days.

825
01:02:58,778 --> 01:03:00,041
It's really sort of flattering

826
01:03:00,181 --> 01:03:02,445
if you want to think about it that way.

827
01:03:02,717 --> 01:03:04,481
A setup like that costs more

828
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:05,982
than we ever took.

829
01:03:06,188 --> 01:03:07,450
Apparently he can afford it.

830
01:03:10,193 --> 01:03:11,627
That crazy Harriman.

831
01:03:14,231 --> 01:03:15,494
That's bad business.

832
01:03:15,734 --> 01:03:16,928
How long do you think

833
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:18,430
I'd stay in operation

834
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:20,434
if every job cost me money?

835
01:03:20,673 --> 01:03:22,938
If he'd just pay me what he's spending

836
01:03:23,176 --> 01:03:24,939
to make me stop robbing him,

837
01:03:25,178 --> 01:03:26,440
I'd stop robbing him.

838
01:03:29,183 --> 01:03:31,948
You probably inherited
every penny you got!

839
01:03:32,187 --> 01:03:32,949
Inherited guys,

840
01:03:33,188 --> 01:03:34,952
what the hell do they know?

841
01:03:35,191 --> 01:03:37,284
You say they were hired permanent?

842
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:40,325
No. Just till they kill you.

843
01:03:50,244 --> 01:03:52,838
That means they're
still after us, Butch,

844
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,208
and it's going to be the same thing

845
01:03:55,450 --> 01:03:56,678
all over again.

846
01:04:00,724 --> 01:04:02,487
They'll show up here...

847
01:04:02,726 --> 01:04:03,988
sooner or later.

848
01:04:21,183 --> 01:04:21,945
Hey, Etta.

849
01:04:23,686 --> 01:04:25,449
I'll get you some more.

850
01:04:25,688 --> 01:04:28,954
Butch and me have been
talking it all over.

851
01:04:29,193 --> 01:04:30,956
Wherever the hell Bolivia is,

852
01:04:31,196 --> 01:04:32,959
that's where we're off to.

853
01:04:33,198 --> 01:04:35,463
We'll go down there and play it safe,

854
01:04:35,734 --> 01:04:37,998
maybe keep our hand in a little bit.

855
01:04:38,204 --> 01:04:39,467
Butch speaks some Spanish.

856
01:04:39,739 --> 01:04:42,003
I can wrestle with a menu O.K.

857
01:04:42,209 --> 01:04:43,973
And you speak it good.

858
01:04:45,746 --> 01:04:49,012
And it'd be good cover
going with a woman.

859
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:50,982
No one expects it.

860
01:04:52,755 --> 01:04:54,519
Then we could travel safer.

861
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:57,522
What I'm saying is,

862
01:04:57,762 --> 01:04:59,024
if you want to go,

863
01:04:59,264 --> 01:05:00,458
I won't stop you,

864
01:05:00,699 --> 01:05:02,463
but the minute you start to whine

865
01:05:02,702 --> 01:05:03,964
or make a nuisance,

866
01:05:04,203 --> 01:05:05,967
I don't care where we are,

867
01:05:06,206 --> 01:05:07,468
I'm dumping you flat.

868
01:05:07,741 --> 01:05:09,505
Don't sugarcoat it like that, Kid.

869
01:05:09,744 --> 01:05:11,006
Tell her straight.

870
01:05:16,753 --> 01:05:18,448
I'm 26, and I'm single

871
01:05:18,688 --> 01:05:19,950
and a schoolteacher,

872
01:05:20,157 --> 01:05:22,922
and that's the bottom of the pit.

873
01:05:23,194 --> 01:05:24,958
And the only excitement I've known

874
01:05:25,197 --> 01:05:26,459
is here with me now.

875
01:05:26,698 --> 01:05:27,961
So I'll go with you,

876
01:05:28,201 --> 01:05:29,463
and I won't whine,

877
01:05:29,702 --> 01:05:30,964
and I'll sew your socks,

878
01:05:31,204 --> 01:05:33,469
and I'll stitch you when you're wounded,

879
01:05:33,707 --> 01:05:35,972
and I'll do anything you ask of me

880
01:05:36,211 --> 01:05:37,473
except one thing.

881
01:05:37,712 --> 01:05:39,476
I won't watch you die.

882
01:05:39,749 --> 01:05:41,011
I'll miss that scene,

883
01:05:41,217 --> 01:05:42,479
if you don't mind.

884
01:06:16,761 --> 01:06:17,956
The future's all yours,

885
01:06:18,164 --> 01:06:19,927
you lousy bicycles.

886
01:11:24,651 --> 01:11:27,415
Well, you know, it could be worse.

887
01:11:27,654 --> 01:11:31,113
You get a lot more for
your money in Bolivia.

888
01:11:31,359 --> 01:11:32,622
I checked on it.

889
01:11:32,861 --> 01:11:34,123
What could they have here

890
01:11:34,363 --> 01:11:37,424
that you could possibly want to buy?

891
01:11:41,705 --> 01:11:43,970
Jeez, all Bolivia can't look like this.

892
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:45,608
How do you know?

893
01:11:45,877 --> 01:11:47,971
This might be the garden spot

894
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:49,442
of the whole country.

895
01:11:49,715 --> 01:11:51,479
People may travel hundreds of miles

896
01:11:51,718 --> 01:11:53,481
just to get to this spot

897
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:54,812
where we're standing now.

898
01:11:55,056 --> 01:11:56,819
This might be the
Atlantic City, New Jersey,

899
01:11:57,058 --> 01:11:58,822
of all Bolivia for all you know.

900
01:11:59,061 --> 01:12:00,323
I know more about Bolivia

901
01:12:00,462 --> 01:12:02,225
than you know about
Atlantic City, New Jersey,

902
01:12:02,464 --> 01:12:03,625
I can tell you that.

903
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:05,925
Aha!

904
01:12:06,169 --> 01:12:08,434
You do, huh?

905
01:12:08,673 --> 01:12:10,437
I was born there.

906
01:12:10,676 --> 01:12:12,940
I was born in New Jersey...

907
01:12:13,178 --> 01:12:14,976
brought up there, so...

908
01:12:15,214 --> 01:12:16,545
I didn't know that.

909
01:12:16,816 --> 01:12:18,978
The total tonnage of what you don't know

910
01:12:19,186 --> 01:12:20,448
is enough to shatter...

911
01:12:20,721 --> 01:12:21,711
We're not accomplishing

912
01:12:21,956 --> 01:12:22,980
as much as we might.

913
01:12:23,191 --> 01:12:25,456
Listen, your job is to back me up,

914
01:12:25,728 --> 01:12:27,252
because you'd starve without me.

915
01:12:28,898 --> 01:12:30,992
And you, your job is to shut up.

916
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:37,003
He'll feel a lot better

917
01:12:37,242 --> 01:12:39,506
after he's robbed a couple of banks.

918
01:12:40,914 --> 01:12:43,007
Ha ha ha ha!

919
01:12:45,252 --> 01:12:46,514
Bolivia.

920
01:12:56,266 --> 01:12:57,528
Hell, it's just a bank

921
01:12:57,801 --> 01:12:59,063
like any other bank.

922
01:12:59,269 --> 01:13:00,965
You got to move in slowly,

923
01:13:01,206 --> 01:13:02,468
check out everything.

924
01:13:02,741 --> 01:13:04,004
The thing to remember...

925
01:13:04,243 --> 01:13:06,507
Don't tell me how to rob a bank.

926
01:13:06,746 --> 01:13:09,011
I know how to rob a bank.

927
01:13:09,249 --> 01:13:11,514
A few dark clouds
appear on your horizon,

928
01:13:11,753 --> 01:13:14,517
and you just go all
to pieces, don't you?

929
01:13:34,214 --> 01:13:35,476
<i>Buenos días, señores.</i>

930
01:13:35,749 --> 01:13:37,080
<i>¿Les puedo servir en algo?</i>

931
01:13:37,284 --> 01:13:39,981
<i>Ordenen para atenderlos
por favor inmediatamente.</i>

932
01:13:42,258 --> 01:13:44,021
<i>¿Quieren hacer algún depósito?</i>

933
01:13:46,263 --> 01:13:47,525
<i>¿Quieren abrir una cuenta?</i>

934
01:13:47,764 --> 01:13:50,029
<i>Bien, el cajero los
atienda inmediatamente.</i>

935
01:13:50,268 --> 01:13:52,031
<i>Los atendemos por todo.</i>

936
01:13:58,278 --> 01:13:59,540
<i>Señor?</i>

937
01:14:11,027 --> 01:14:12,017
<i>Adiós.</i>

938
01:14:13,697 --> 01:14:15,495
This is a robbery.

939
01:14:15,767 --> 01:14:17,962
<i>Esto es un robo.</i>

940
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:20,968
<i>Esto es un robo.</i>

941
01:14:26,213 --> 01:14:28,478
This is supposed to
be a unison recitation.

942
01:14:28,749 --> 01:14:31,014
Why do I have to do any of this?

943
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:32,482
He's the one

944
01:14:32,754 --> 01:14:34,518
who claimed he knew the language.

945
01:14:34,757 --> 01:14:36,520
Your line of work requires
a specialized vocabulary.

946
01:14:36,759 --> 01:14:39,251
I got nervous. I forgot
the words. Shoot me.

947
01:14:39,463 --> 01:14:41,363
You've had worse ideas lately.

948
01:14:41,599 --> 01:14:42,999
Raise your hands.

949
01:14:44,769 --> 01:14:47,034
<i>Uh... las manos arriba.</i>

950
01:14:47,273 --> 01:14:48,535
Raise them.

951
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:51,539
<i>Arriba.</i>

952
01:14:51,778 --> 01:14:54,543
All of you back against the wall.

953
01:14:54,782 --> 01:14:59,049
<i>Todos ustedes, um...</i>

954
01:14:59,288 --> 01:15:02,486
<i>arrísmense a la pared.</i>

955
01:15:02,759 --> 01:15:04,522
Give me the money.

956
01:15:10,235 --> 01:15:12,727
Give me the money.

957
01:15:13,006 --> 01:15:15,031
Give me the money.

958
01:15:15,241 --> 01:15:16,937
This is not going to work,

959
01:15:17,211 --> 01:15:19,475
and we're going to be up all night

960
01:15:19,713 --> 01:15:20,976
until you get this.

961
01:15:21,216 --> 01:15:22,979
Now give me the money.

962
01:15:26,722 --> 01:15:28,987
It's on the tip of my tongue, Etta.

963
01:15:29,226 --> 01:15:30,488
I swear it.

964
01:15:32,764 --> 01:15:35,097
Butch, are you still thinking in there?

965
01:15:35,301 --> 01:15:38,099
What the hell else is there to do?

966
01:15:38,337 --> 01:15:40,499
Try this one.

967
01:15:40,774 --> 01:15:43,243
Where is the safe? Open it.

968
01:15:43,444 --> 01:15:45,002
<i>Dónde es...</i>

969
01:15:49,284 --> 01:15:51,549
Uh, that's a hard one.

970
01:15:54,291 --> 01:15:56,782
<i>¿Dónde está la caja? ¡Ábrala!</i>

971
01:15:57,027 --> 01:15:59,622
That's very good, Butch.

972
01:15:59,864 --> 01:16:01,992
You're a good teacher. Etta.

973
01:16:03,803 --> 01:16:05,065
<i>¡Esto es un robo!</i>

974
01:16:11,179 --> 01:16:13,478
<i>Manos a...</i>

975
01:16:13,749 --> 01:16:15,478
<i>Manos, um...</i>

976
01:16:22,526 --> 01:16:24,221
<i>¡Manos arriba!</i>

977
01:16:24,463 --> 01:16:26,090
They got them up! Skip down!

978
01:16:26,365 --> 01:16:27,798
<i>- ¡Arriba!
- Skip on down!</i>

979
01:16:28,033 --> 01:16:31,333
<i>Todos ustedes arrísmense a la pared.</i>

980
01:16:31,537 --> 01:16:33,438
They're against the wall already!

981
01:16:33,707 --> 01:16:34,469
<i>Dónde es...</i>

982
01:16:34,708 --> 01:16:35,971
Oh, you're so damn smart,

983
01:16:36,211 --> 01:16:37,508
you read it.

984
01:16:46,423 --> 01:16:47,686
A goddamn crib sheet.

985
01:16:47,959 --> 01:16:49,221
You almost blew it.

986
01:16:49,427 --> 01:16:50,689
You sure didn't help much.

987
01:16:50,963 --> 01:16:53,727
You can't do anything
without a crib sheet.

988
01:17:09,285 --> 01:17:12,016
For God's sake, don't drop the money!

989
01:17:12,256 --> 01:17:14,054
I won't drop the money!

990
01:17:14,292 --> 01:17:15,520
<i>Voy a traer el comisario.</i>

991
01:17:15,794 --> 01:17:16,852
<i>Sí, vamos.</i>

992
01:17:17,062 --> 01:17:17,757
<i>Ay, nombre.</i>

993
01:17:17,997 --> 01:17:18,759
<i>Evarista.</i>

994
01:17:18,998 --> 01:17:19,965
<i>¿Evarista qué?</i>

995
01:17:20,199 --> 01:17:21,292
<i>Señor comandante,</i>

996
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:23,969
<i>dos hombres acometen y asaltan el banco.</i>

997
01:17:24,204 --> 01:17:25,797
<i>Dos yanquis y una muchacha</i>

998
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:27,666
<i>se fueron por la cañada.</i>

999
01:17:27,909 --> 01:17:30,003
<i>Se llevaron mi pistola y todo el dinero.</i>

1000
01:17:30,245 --> 01:17:31,007
<i>Vámanos!</i>

1001
01:17:31,246 --> 01:17:32,008
<i>A caballos!</i>

1002
01:18:24,614 --> 01:18:26,242
Isn't that a pretty sight?

1003
01:18:29,319 --> 01:18:31,481
Well, we're back in
business, boys and girls,

1004
01:18:31,756 --> 01:18:33,018
just like the old days.

1005
01:23:00,863 --> 01:23:02,524
Let's stay here and get him

1006
01:23:02,765 --> 01:23:04,027
and be done with it.

1007
01:23:04,234 --> 01:23:05,496
But what if we lose?

1008
01:23:05,768 --> 01:23:07,532
We saw him with two guys.

1009
01:23:07,771 --> 01:23:09,033
What if he's got 20?

1010
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:11,505
You don't know for sure it's LeFors.

1011
01:23:11,776 --> 01:23:13,539
I'm a hell of a guesser.

1012
01:23:13,778 --> 01:23:15,542
He can't arrest you.
It's a foreign country.

1013
01:23:15,781 --> 01:23:16,975
He can't take you back.

1014
01:23:17,216 --> 01:23:18,980
He's not going to take anybody back.

1015
01:23:19,219 --> 01:23:20,982
He's going to wait for us

1016
01:23:21,221 --> 01:23:22,484
to pull another job

1017
01:23:22,690 --> 01:23:23,952
and then hunt us down.

1018
01:23:24,225 --> 01:23:25,488
Let's finish it now, Butch,

1019
01:23:25,694 --> 01:23:26,956
one way or the other.

1020
01:23:28,731 --> 01:23:30,495
He's got to wait for us

1021
01:23:30,734 --> 01:23:31,996
to pull another job.

1022
01:23:33,738 --> 01:23:36,002
Well, what if there isn't another job?

1023
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:37,503
He can't arrest us,

1024
01:23:37,743 --> 01:23:40,007
and he can't take us out of here.

1025
01:23:40,245 --> 01:23:41,508
We'll drive him crazy.

1026
01:23:41,748 --> 01:23:43,010
We'll outlast the bastard.

1027
01:23:43,249 --> 01:23:44,341
We'll go straight.

1028
01:23:44,585 --> 01:23:46,519
So you want jobs.

1029
01:23:46,754 --> 01:23:49,519
You're from the U.S. of A.,

1030
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:52,022
and you are seeking after employment.

1031
01:23:52,295 --> 01:23:54,058
Well, you couldn't have picked

1032
01:23:54,297 --> 01:23:56,562
a more out of the way place

1033
01:23:56,767 --> 01:23:58,029
in all of Bolivia,

1034
01:23:58,302 --> 01:23:59,564
I'll tell you that.

1035
01:23:59,771 --> 01:24:01,466
<i>Gracias, Jesús.</i>

1036
01:24:01,773 --> 01:24:04,538
Ordinarily you've got to wait

1037
01:24:04,777 --> 01:24:06,540
to work for Percy Garrison,

1038
01:24:06,779 --> 01:24:08,543
but this ain't ordinarily.

1039
01:24:08,782 --> 01:24:09,544
Bingo.

1040
01:24:09,783 --> 01:24:11,547
You mean there are jobs.

1041
01:24:11,786 --> 01:24:13,048
Yes, there are jobs.

1042
01:24:13,254 --> 01:24:14,516
There are lots of jobs.

1043
01:24:14,789 --> 01:24:16,553
Don't you want to know why?

1044
01:24:16,792 --> 01:24:17,690
Yeah, why?

1045
01:24:19,028 --> 01:24:20,495
Damn it.

1046
01:24:20,697 --> 01:24:23,963
Because I cannot promise to pay you.

1047
01:24:24,234 --> 01:24:26,328
Don't you want to know why?

1048
01:24:27,606 --> 01:24:28,971
O.K., why?

1049
01:24:30,710 --> 01:24:33,474
On account of the payroll thieves,

1050
01:24:33,713 --> 01:24:34,976
fellow citizens.

1051
01:24:35,248 --> 01:24:37,011
You see, every mine around

1052
01:24:37,250 --> 01:24:39,014
gets its payroll

1053
01:24:39,253 --> 01:24:40,515
from La Paz.

1054
01:24:40,755 --> 01:24:42,018
And every mine around

1055
01:24:42,257 --> 01:24:44,521
gets its payroll held up.

1056
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:50,029
Some say it's the Bolivian Bandits,

1057
01:24:50,267 --> 01:24:51,529
and some say

1058
01:24:51,769 --> 01:24:55,035
<i>that it's the bandidos yanquis.</i>

1059
01:24:55,307 --> 01:24:56,570
Could I see that?

1060
01:25:00,113 --> 01:25:02,014
Mm-hmm.

1061
01:25:02,249 --> 01:25:04,012
Fairly nice-looking piece.

1062
01:25:04,252 --> 01:25:06,516
Can you hit anything?

1063
01:25:06,721 --> 01:25:07,984
Sometimes.

1064
01:25:17,201 --> 01:25:18,498
Hit that.

1065
01:25:24,711 --> 01:25:26,474
No, no, son. No, son.

1066
01:25:26,713 --> 01:25:28,477
I just want to know,

1067
01:25:28,716 --> 01:25:30,981
can you shoot your piece?

1068
01:25:33,922 --> 01:25:34,685
Shoot.

1069
01:25:46,005 --> 01:25:47,529
Damn it.

1070
01:25:47,773 --> 01:25:49,536
Can I move?

1071
01:25:49,776 --> 01:25:50,538
Move?

1072
01:25:50,777 --> 01:25:53,109
What the hell you mean, move?

1073
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,083
I'm better when I move.

1074
01:26:00,322 --> 01:26:01,347
Yeah.

1075
01:26:02,726 --> 01:26:04,489
Well, considering that I'm desperate

1076
01:26:04,728 --> 01:26:06,993
and you're just what I'm looking for,

1077
01:26:07,264 --> 01:26:08,526
on top of which

1078
01:26:08,734 --> 01:26:10,998
you stem from the U.S. of A.,

1079
01:26:11,269 --> 01:26:12,532
we start tomorrow morning.

1080
01:26:12,739 --> 01:26:14,502
You mean we got jobs.

1081
01:26:14,741 --> 01:26:16,003
Payroll guard.

1082
01:26:16,276 --> 01:26:16,970
Damn.

1083
01:26:17,211 --> 01:26:18,974
<i>Vámanos a trabajar!</i>

1084
01:26:19,213 --> 01:26:20,306
Hey, Chucho!

1085
01:26:20,548 --> 01:26:21,480
Chucho!

1086
01:26:21,716 --> 01:26:23,844
Oh, don't you remember

1087
01:26:24,086 --> 01:26:26,680
Sweet Betsy from Pike

1088
01:26:26,956 --> 01:26:28,424
Crossed the high mountains

1089
01:26:28,625 --> 01:26:31,219
With her lover Ike

1090
01:26:31,462 --> 01:26:32,588
Two yoke of oxen

1091
01:26:32,864 --> 01:26:35,162
And a big yalla dog

1092
01:26:35,367 --> 01:26:36,766
Tall Shanghai rooster

1093
01:26:37,035 --> 01:26:38,832
And one spotted hog

1094
01:26:39,105 --> 01:26:41,198
Toodle-dang
hoodie di-do

1095
01:26:41,441 --> 01:26:43,137
Doodle-dang hoodie ay

1096
01:26:43,377 --> 01:26:45,106
Toodle-dang
hoodie di-do

1097
01:26:45,346 --> 01:26:47,440
Doodle-dang hoodie ay

1098
01:26:47,682 --> 01:26:49,047
Shanghai ran off

1099
01:26:49,284 --> 01:26:51,378
And the cattle all died

1100
01:26:51,621 --> 01:26:53,248
Last piece of bacon...

1101
01:26:53,489 --> 01:26:55,549
I think they're in the trees up ahead.

1102
01:26:55,793 --> 01:26:57,556
In the bushes on the left.

1103
01:26:57,795 --> 01:26:59,559
They're in the trees up ahead.

1104
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:00,992
You take the trees,

1105
01:27:01,232 --> 01:27:02,495
I'll take the bushes.

1106
01:27:02,735 --> 01:27:05,169
Will you two beginners cut it out?

1107
01:27:05,404 --> 01:27:08,033
Well, we're just trying
to spot an ambush.

1108
01:27:08,308 --> 01:27:10,038
Morons.

1109
01:27:10,278 --> 01:27:13,042
I've got morons on my team.

1110
01:27:13,282 --> 01:27:15,546
Nobody is going to rob us

1111
01:27:15,751 --> 01:27:16,946
going down the mountain.

1112
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:18,983
We have got no money

1113
01:27:19,222 --> 01:27:20,382
going down the mountain.

1114
01:27:20,657 --> 01:27:23,320
When we have got the money

1115
01:27:23,561 --> 01:27:25,189
on the way back,

1116
01:27:25,463 --> 01:27:26,862
then you can sweat.

1117
01:27:27,098 --> 01:27:28,498
Bingo.

1118
01:27:28,701 --> 01:27:29,827
Move it out!

1119
01:27:31,103 --> 01:27:31,899
Move it!

1120
01:27:55,168 --> 01:27:57,932
We hit this place in June, didn't we?

1121
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:11,887
Jones!

1122
01:28:12,122 --> 01:28:14,216
Give me a hand over here.

1123
01:28:14,459 --> 01:28:16,825
Who am I, Smith or Jones?

1124
01:28:17,095 --> 01:28:18,358
Live.

1125
01:28:35,618 --> 01:28:37,382
About a half hour more,

1126
01:28:37,621 --> 01:28:39,885
and we can start to worry...

1127
01:28:40,124 --> 01:28:41,387
as soon as we get

1128
01:28:41,626 --> 01:28:42,888
to that pass up there.

1129
01:28:43,128 --> 01:28:45,393
We'll be all right till then.

1130
01:28:45,631 --> 01:28:47,394
They might try something here.

1131
01:28:47,633 --> 01:28:49,431
No. Better cover up there.

1132
01:28:51,638 --> 01:28:53,903
You got to relax, you fellas.

1133
01:28:54,175 --> 01:28:57,111
You got to get used to Bolivian ways.

1134
01:28:57,346 --> 01:28:59,109
You got to go easy.

1135
01:28:59,348 --> 01:29:00,111
Damn it!

1136
01:29:00,350 --> 01:29:01,544
Like I do.

1137
01:29:01,751 --> 01:29:04,516
Of course, you probably think I'm crazy,

1138
01:29:04,755 --> 01:29:06,347
but I'm not.

1139
01:29:06,624 --> 01:29:07,887
Bingo.

1140
01:29:08,126 --> 01:29:08,888
I'm colorful.

1141
01:29:09,127 --> 01:29:10,389
That's what happens

1142
01:29:10,629 --> 01:29:13,064
when you live 10 years alone in Bolivia.

1143
01:29:13,299 --> 01:29:14,767
You get colorful.

1144
01:29:34,593 --> 01:29:35,855
Where are they?

1145
01:29:39,132 --> 01:29:40,997
I can't see them.

1146
01:29:54,651 --> 01:29:56,950
Let's get out of here.

1147
01:31:30,539 --> 01:31:33,304
Tell them to leave the money and go.

1148
01:31:34,811 --> 01:31:37,280
<i>Dijen el dinoro...</i>

1149
01:31:37,515 --> 01:31:39,780
<i>Dinero... and, uh...</i>

1150
01:31:40,051 --> 01:31:41,416
<i>y vayanese.</i>

1151
01:31:43,289 --> 01:31:46,087
<i>¿Que dejemos el dinero y nos vayamos?</i>

1152
01:31:46,326 --> 01:31:47,918
Tell them we were hired

1153
01:31:48,162 --> 01:31:51,155
to take it back. It's our job.

1154
01:31:51,399 --> 01:31:53,663
Tell them the money isn't ours.

1155
01:31:55,471 --> 01:31:56,699
<i>El dinero...</i>

1156
01:31:56,906 --> 01:31:58,374
<i>no es nuestro.</i>

1157
01:31:58,642 --> 01:32:00,837
<i>No, ya no es de ustedes.</i>

1158
01:32:01,077 --> 01:32:02,340
<i>Ahora es de nosotros.</i>

1159
01:32:02,580 --> 01:32:03,547
<i>Claro.</i>

1160
01:32:05,517 --> 01:32:08,247
We'll try telling them again.

1161
01:32:08,487 --> 01:32:12,424
It's our job. The money isn't ours.

1162
01:32:12,659 --> 01:32:15,788
<i>El dinero no es nuestro.</i>

1163
01:32:16,063 --> 01:32:17,622
<i>Lo necesitamos.</i>

1164
01:32:17,832 --> 01:32:20,164
<i>También nosotros necesitamos.</i>

1165
01:32:21,771 --> 01:32:23,033
What do you think?

1166
01:32:23,306 --> 01:32:24,604
Not so good.

1167
01:32:24,808 --> 01:32:26,537
Can you take the two on the right?

1168
01:32:26,777 --> 01:32:29,747
Kid, there's something I
think I ought to tell you.

1169
01:32:30,014 --> 01:32:31,777
I never shot anybody before.

1170
01:32:36,856 --> 01:32:39,792
One hell of a time to tell me.

1171
01:32:45,634 --> 01:32:47,432
Try for the two on the right

1172
01:32:47,670 --> 01:32:48,432
dead center.

1173
01:32:48,671 --> 01:32:50,434
That way, if you miss a little,

1174
01:32:50,673 --> 01:32:51,936
you'll still hit something.

1175
01:32:52,209 --> 01:32:53,836
Go.

1176
01:32:54,078 --> 01:32:54,841
Please.

1177
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:56,445
<i>¿Qué?</i>

1178
01:32:56,648 --> 01:32:57,740
<i>Por favor.</i>

1179
01:32:58,016 --> 01:32:59,382
<i>¿Por favor?</i>

1180
01:33:03,123 --> 01:33:11,726
Aah!

1181
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:49,580
Well, we've gone straight.

1182
01:33:53,486 --> 01:33:55,044
What'll we try now?

1183
01:34:12,344 --> 01:34:15,109
There are other ways of
going straight, you know.

1184
01:34:29,666 --> 01:34:31,930
There are other ways of going straight.

1185
01:34:35,539 --> 01:34:36,631
There's farming.

1186
01:34:40,245 --> 01:34:42,009
We could buy a place.

1187
01:34:43,449 --> 01:34:45,714
I don't know how to farm.

1188
01:34:49,424 --> 01:34:51,187
What about a ranch, then?

1189
01:34:51,426 --> 01:34:53,327
I don't know.

1190
01:34:53,562 --> 01:34:55,826
The last time we tried ranching

1191
01:34:56,099 --> 01:34:57,862
was during our rustling days.

1192
01:34:58,101 --> 01:34:58,863
Even then,

1193
01:34:59,102 --> 01:35:01,298
we weren't much good at it.

1194
01:35:01,506 --> 01:35:03,269
It's hard. Hours are brutal.

1195
01:35:03,508 --> 01:35:05,773
No, you got to be a kid

1196
01:35:06,044 --> 01:35:07,306
to start a ranch.

1197
01:35:21,431 --> 01:35:23,229
Hey.

1198
01:35:23,467 --> 01:35:24,331
Hmm?

1199
01:35:28,273 --> 01:35:31,038
I might go back ahead of you.

1200
01:35:37,617 --> 01:35:39,245
You mean home?

1201
01:35:41,456 --> 01:35:43,220
I was thinking of it.

1202
01:35:48,932 --> 01:35:50,491
Whatever you want, Etta.

1203
01:35:55,373 --> 01:35:56,635
Maybe I'll go.

1204
01:36:06,387 --> 01:36:07,547
Hey.

1205
01:36:07,789 --> 01:36:08,814
Hmm?

1206
01:36:09,091 --> 01:36:10,353
Etta's thinking of, uh,

1207
01:36:10,559 --> 01:36:12,528
maybe going home ahead of us.

1208
01:36:16,234 --> 01:36:17,633
Whatever she wants.

1209
01:36:20,372 --> 01:36:21,634
I'll go, then.

1210
01:37:00,122 --> 01:37:01,317
<i>¡Manos arriba!</i>

1211
01:37:02,559 --> 01:37:03,821
How much you got?

1212
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:06,325
It's hardly worth it. Alpoca mine.

1213
01:37:06,564 --> 01:37:08,829
I tell you, no more jungle work for me.

1214
01:37:09,067 --> 01:37:11,331
You're getting to be an old maid.

1215
01:37:11,570 --> 01:37:13,835
Keep your old maid remarks to yourself.

1216
01:37:14,106 --> 01:37:16,370
I'll work in the city, in the mountains,

1217
01:37:16,577 --> 01:37:19,045
but from now on jungle work is out.

1218
01:37:19,313 --> 01:37:20,075
<i>¿Bandidos yanquis?</i>

1219
01:37:20,315 --> 01:37:21,213
Mm-hmm.

1220
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:24,314
Tell them to be quiet.

1221
01:37:24,553 --> 01:37:25,815
What's the word?

1222
01:37:26,088 --> 01:37:26,850
<i>Quietas.</i>

1223
01:37:27,089 --> 01:37:27,852
<i>Quietas.</i>

1224
01:37:38,003 --> 01:37:39,266
I tell you,

1225
01:37:39,505 --> 01:37:41,769
the jungle's a better
cover for payrolls.

1226
01:37:42,041 --> 01:37:44,306
Kid, I got a right to my opinion,

1227
01:37:44,511 --> 01:37:45,773
and in my opinion,

1228
01:37:46,046 --> 01:37:47,309
there are snakes in the jungle.

1229
01:37:47,515 --> 01:37:48,914
I don't work around snakes.

1230
01:37:49,184 --> 01:37:50,446
What is this place?

1231
01:37:51,887 --> 01:37:52,911
I don't know.

1232
01:37:53,189 --> 01:37:54,680
San Vincente, I think.

1233
01:37:54,891 --> 01:37:55,653
<i>¿Comer?</i>

1234
01:37:55,892 --> 01:37:56,654
<i>Si, Señor.</i>

1235
01:37:56,893 --> 01:37:58,156
<i>Pasen. Juan, ven.</i>

1236
01:37:58,429 --> 01:38:00,693
<i>Llévate los caballos.</i>

1237
01:38:26,097 --> 01:38:28,361
I don't enjoy jungles.
I don't enjoy swamps.

1238
01:38:28,567 --> 01:38:29,829
I don't like snakes.

1239
01:38:30,102 --> 01:38:31,865
I don't much care for night work.

1240
01:38:32,104 --> 01:38:33,197
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

1241
01:38:34,574 --> 01:38:35,370
<i>¡Capitán! ¡Capitán!</i>

1242
01:38:35,609 --> 01:38:37,373
<i>Capitán, allá en la plaza,</i>

1243
01:38:37,612 --> 01:38:40,377
<i>hay una mula de las minas de Alpoca.</i>

1244
01:38:40,616 --> 01:38:41,878
<i>¿Las minas de Alpoca?</i>

1245
01:38:42,117 --> 01:38:43,379
<i>Sí, sí. Allí están.</i>

1246
01:38:43,619 --> 01:38:45,383
<i>Dos hombres la acaban de traer.</i>

1247
01:38:45,622 --> 01:38:47,146
<i>Están comiendo en el
restaurante de mi papá.</i>

1248
01:38:47,390 --> 01:38:49,825
<i>El guisado está delicioso.</i>

1249
01:38:50,094 --> 01:38:52,359
<i>Para chuparse los dedos.</i>

1250
01:38:52,564 --> 01:38:55,329
<i>Si quieren mas, es la
especialidad de la casa,</i>

1251
01:38:55,568 --> 01:38:56,830
<i>si quieren mas,</i>

1252
01:38:57,103 --> 01:38:58,365
<i>no tengan pena y díganmelo.</i>

1253
01:38:58,571 --> 01:39:00,335
<i>Yo estoy aquí para servirles.</i>

1254
01:39:00,574 --> 01:39:02,702
<i>Agradezco la visita de tan
distinguidos caballeros.</i>

1255
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:06,342
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

1256
01:39:06,582 --> 01:39:07,640
<i>Para servirles.</i>

1257
01:39:07,917 --> 01:39:08,542
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

1258
01:39:08,784 --> 01:39:09,546
<i>Sí.</i>

1259
01:39:12,889 --> 01:39:14,653
The specialty of the house,

1260
01:39:14,892 --> 01:39:16,154
and it's still moving.

1261
01:39:23,403 --> 01:39:24,665
Well, that settles it.

1262
01:39:24,871 --> 01:39:27,136
This place gets no more of my business.

1263
01:39:36,352 --> 01:39:37,445
Hey.

1264
01:39:37,688 --> 01:39:38,552
What?

1265
01:39:38,789 --> 01:39:41,918
What do you think? I
bet it's just one guy.

1266
01:39:50,570 --> 01:39:53,597
Don't you get sick of
being right all the time?

1267
01:40:23,245 --> 01:40:24,371
Reloading.

1268
01:40:27,717 --> 01:40:28,979
That's all I got.

1269
01:40:33,157 --> 01:40:34,420
We're going to run out

1270
01:40:34,660 --> 01:40:38,222
unless we can get to that
mule and get some more.

1271
01:40:42,770 --> 01:40:43,930
I'll go.

1272
01:40:44,171 --> 01:40:47,141
This is no time for
bravery. I'll let you.

1273
01:40:49,645 --> 01:40:50,441
Loaded.

1274
01:40:57,522 --> 01:40:58,648
Hell!

1275
01:40:58,890 --> 01:41:01,086
I'm the one that has to go.

1276
01:41:02,695 --> 01:41:03,753
Why you?

1277
01:41:03,996 --> 01:41:06,056
'Cause I could never give you cover.

1278
01:41:06,333 --> 01:41:08,097
You can cover me.

1279
01:41:09,937 --> 01:41:12,736
You can see I'm right, can't you?

1280
01:41:20,150 --> 01:41:21,549
You go.

1281
01:41:21,785 --> 01:41:24,311
Yeah, why am I always so damn smart?

1282
01:41:31,298 --> 01:41:32,060
Here.

1283
01:41:40,376 --> 01:41:41,138
Go.

1284
01:41:59,033 --> 01:41:59,795
O.K.

1285
01:42:39,818 --> 01:42:40,580
Go.

1286
01:43:41,629 --> 01:43:42,391
Ah!

1287
01:44:26,519 --> 01:44:29,717
Is... Is that what
you call giving cover?

1288
01:44:29,923 --> 01:44:32,687
Is that what you call running?

1289
01:44:32,927 --> 01:44:35,691
If I knew you were going to stroll...

1290
01:44:36,932 --> 01:44:38,194
You never could shoot,

1291
01:44:38,467 --> 01:44:40,230
not from the very beginning.

1292
01:44:46,444 --> 01:44:48,208
And you are all mouth.

1293
01:44:57,091 --> 01:44:58,752
<i>Jefe, llega el ejército.</i>

1294
01:45:10,642 --> 01:45:11,404
<i>Mi capitán.</i>

1295
01:45:13,378 --> 01:45:14,140
<i>¿Dónde están?</i>

1296
01:45:14,379 --> 01:45:15,642
<i>Allí en la plaza.</i>

1297
01:45:15,881 --> 01:45:17,075
<i>¿Cuántos hombres son?</i>

1298
01:45:17,316 --> 01:45:18,078
<i>Dos hombres.</i>

1299
01:45:18,318 --> 01:45:19,080
<i>¿Dos hombres?</i>

1300
01:45:19,319 --> 01:45:20,581
<i>Mi capitán, por favor...</i>

1301
01:45:20,820 --> 01:45:21,582
<i>¿Dos?</i>

1302
01:45:21,821 --> 01:45:22,846
<i>Bandidos yanquis.</i>

1303
01:45:23,124 --> 01:45:24,386
<i>¿Bandidos yanquis, eh?</i>

1304
01:45:24,592 --> 01:45:25,855
<i>Sí, mi capitán.</i>

1305
01:45:26,128 --> 01:45:26,890
Hmm.

1306
01:45:27,129 --> 01:45:28,391
<i>Sargento Rico,</i>

1307
01:45:28,597 --> 01:45:29,895
<i>desmonten 20 hombres</i>

1308
01:45:30,166 --> 01:45:31,895
<i>y vayan con el teniente.</i>

1309
01:46:45,595 --> 01:46:48,359
I've got a great idea
where we should go next.

1310
01:46:48,598 --> 01:46:50,362
I don't want to hear it.

1311
01:46:50,601 --> 01:46:51,863
You'll change your mind.

1312
01:46:52,102 --> 01:46:52,864
Shut up!

1313
01:46:53,104 --> 01:46:53,866
O.K., O.K.

1314
01:46:54,105 --> 01:46:55,367
Your ideas got us here.

1315
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:56,572
Forget it!

1316
01:46:56,775 --> 01:46:59,540
I never want to hear
another of your ideas.

1317
01:46:59,812 --> 01:47:00,574
All right.

1318
01:47:00,814 --> 01:47:01,508
O.K.

1319
01:47:11,193 --> 01:47:12,252
Australia.

1320
01:47:15,332 --> 01:47:18,029
I figured secretly you wanted to know,

1321
01:47:18,269 --> 01:47:19,531
so I told you.

1322
01:47:19,738 --> 01:47:20,705
Australia.

1323
01:47:22,607 --> 01:47:23,870
That's your great idea?

1324
01:47:24,143 --> 01:47:25,906
Oh, boy, it's the latest in...

1325
01:47:26,145 --> 01:47:27,408
in a long line.

1326
01:47:27,648 --> 01:47:29,411
Australia's no better than here.

1327
01:47:29,650 --> 01:47:30,912
Aw, that's all you know.

1328
01:47:31,152 --> 01:47:32,414
Name me one thing.

1329
01:47:32,654 --> 01:47:34,417
They speak English in Australia.

1330
01:47:34,656 --> 01:47:35,419
They do?

1331
01:47:35,658 --> 01:47:36,920
That's right, smart guy.

1332
01:47:37,159 --> 01:47:38,421
So we wouldn't be foreigners.

1333
01:47:40,030 --> 01:47:41,292
They got horses in Australia.

1334
01:47:41,531 --> 01:47:44,797
They got thousands of
miles we could hide out in.

1335
01:47:45,036 --> 01:47:46,800
And a good climate, nice beaches.

1336
01:47:47,039 --> 01:47:48,301
You could learn to swim.

1337
01:47:48,540 --> 01:47:49,302
No!

1338
01:47:49,541 --> 01:47:50,941
Swimming isn't important.

1339
01:47:53,914 --> 01:47:56,405
What about the banks?

1340
01:47:56,650 --> 01:47:58,141
They're easy.

1341
01:47:58,420 --> 01:47:59,910
Easy, ripe, and luscious.

1342
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:05,724
The banks or the women?

1343
01:48:05,963 --> 01:48:08,727
Well, once you've got
one, you've got the other.

1344
01:48:11,636 --> 01:48:13,400
It's a long way, isn't it?

1345
01:48:13,639 --> 01:48:15,903
Aw! Everything's got
to be perfect with you.

1346
01:48:16,175 --> 01:48:17,871
I don't want to get there

1347
01:48:18,078 --> 01:48:19,340
and find out it stinks.

1348
01:48:19,579 --> 01:48:20,740
At least think about it.

1349
01:48:23,684 --> 01:48:24,709
All right.

1350
01:48:26,288 --> 01:48:27,550
I'll think about it.

1351
01:48:32,696 --> 01:48:33,458
Hey.

1352
01:48:35,700 --> 01:48:37,031
When we get outside...

1353
01:48:37,269 --> 01:48:39,534
and we get to the horses,

1354
01:48:39,772 --> 01:48:41,034
just remember one thing.

1355
01:48:45,279 --> 01:48:46,541
Hey, wait a minute.

1356
01:48:46,780 --> 01:48:48,248
What?

1357
01:48:48,483 --> 01:48:51,248
You didn't see LeFors
out there, did you?

1358
01:48:51,487 --> 01:48:52,385
LeFors?

1359
01:48:53,722 --> 01:48:55,486
No.

1360
01:48:55,725 --> 01:48:57,693
Oh, good.

1361
01:48:57,928 --> 01:48:59,191
For a moment there,

1362
01:48:59,464 --> 01:49:01,659
I thought we were in trouble.

1363
01:49:07,740 --> 01:49:08,399
<i>¡Fuego!</i>

1364
01:49:11,011 --> 01:49:11,875
<i>¡Fuego!</i>

1365
01:49:15,217 --> 01:49:16,241
<i>¡Fuego!</i>
