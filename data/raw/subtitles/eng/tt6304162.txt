182
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,543
By the way,
I haven't talked to him for a long time,

183
00:22:22,582 --> 00:22:23,695
lack of time.

184
00:22:24,367 --> 00:22:25,634
Just

185
00:22:25,903 --> 00:22:28,082
saying hello to each other, sometimes, from afar.

186
00:22:28,274 --> 00:22:30,002
- You won't tell anybody, right?

187
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:34,447
- Just like during a confession, don't worry.

188
00:22:50,767 --> 00:22:53,647
- What do you think,
will there be the end of the world?

189
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:59,119
- For sure.

190
00:23:00,751 --> 00:23:03,343
Will you hand me some material to work with?

191
00:23:03,535 --> 00:23:04,879
Have anything?

192
00:23:07,183 --> 00:23:08,719
God said we must share.

193
00:23:08,873 --> 00:23:10,927
- Maybe I'll get something in the evening.

194
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:13,807
- This will a mutual benefit, don't worry.

195
00:23:13,999 --> 00:23:14,633
- Mhm.

196
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:16,553
- Oh my...

197
00:23:18,348 --> 00:23:19,337
- He's worrying a lot.

198
00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:20,518
- Good, let him worry.

199
00:23:20,537 --> 00:23:21,382
- He's suffering, poor guy.

200
00:23:21,574 --> 00:23:24,847
- Good. They all are masters at messing things up,
how about cleaning things?

201
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:27,305
- You think he's worrying about the kid?

202
00:23:27,497 --> 00:23:28,495
Yeah, right.

203
00:23:28,745 --> 00:23:31,625
Ha has loans from the bank, he's afraid of getting fired.

204
00:23:32,066 --> 00:23:35,714
You know, his boss is all so Orthodox, to the bone.

205
00:23:35,906 --> 00:23:36,790
- A fundamentalist?

206
00:23:36,828 --> 00:23:37,404
- Mhm.

207
00:23:37,634 --> 00:23:40,246
Has a huge beard while wearing a Brioni-costume.

208
00:23:40,476 --> 00:23:41,446
- A glamorous guy?

209
00:23:41,647 --> 00:23:42,550
- Indeed.

210
00:23:42,761 --> 00:23:45,257
He started an Orthodox shariah there.

211
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:47,100
You get a job only if you're married.

212
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:48,559
And baptized, of course.

213
00:23:48,713 --> 00:23:51,324
And during our vacations we had a pilgrimage
all around the temples.

214
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,436
- Yeah, I remember. On the other hand,

215
00:23:53,628 --> 00:23:54,934
it's kind of cool. Exoticism.

216
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,354
- Oh come on, it's so boring.

217
00:23:56,546 --> 00:23:57,871
- Bend your leg, shall we.

218
00:23:57,929 --> 00:23:59,503
- But he has a big salary for that.

219
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:02,210
So, as I see, he's really getting nervous.

220
00:24:02,748 --> 00:24:04,236
- You think he can really get fired?

221
00:24:04,428 --> 00:24:05,762
- The hell I know.

222
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:06,857
I really hope.

223
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,479
- And what about the alimony?

224
00:24:08,671 --> 00:24:09,410
- Ouch!

225
00:24:09,602 --> 00:24:10,735
Are you kidding me?

226
00:24:10,966 --> 00:24:12,511
- Hey, there's very little left, relax.

227
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:13,865
My friend told me once

228
00:24:14,057 --> 00:24:16,534
that her boss is fond of extreme sports.

229
00:24:16,726 --> 00:24:17,273
- Really?
- Yes.

230
00:24:17,465 --> 00:24:20,758
So he's taking them to parachute or to canoe

231
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:21,929
or to downhill-ski.

232
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,849
- Downhill-skiing is cool.

233
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:24,646
- Well...

234
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,969
The knee of my friend broke,

235
00:24:27,161 --> 00:24:28,831
so she had to wear a cast for half a year.

236
00:24:29,023 --> 00:24:29,858
Goodbye the ligament.

237
00:24:30,098 --> 00:24:30,886
- Hardcore...

238
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:34,111
- So some of them started buying
certificates on the internet

239
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,175
about the heart condition
or the blood-pressure.

240
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:37,644
- And?
- Got fired.

241
00:24:37,836 --> 00:24:40,601
- If you're ill, go to a hospital.
- Holy crap.

242
00:24:40,793 --> 00:24:42,454
- So, the temples of yours,

243
00:24:42,646 --> 00:24:45,190
those prayers - all that is still bearable.
Turn over.

244
00:24:45,574 --> 00:24:48,022
- Well, I don't know. I think...

245
00:24:48,214 --> 00:24:50,825
Vacations mean summer, sunshine, a beach,

246
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,330
an all-inclusive hotel...

247
00:24:54,454 --> 00:24:56,729
- And what does your new boyfriend say about this?

248
00:24:56,921 --> 00:24:58,457
- He's fine with it.

249
00:24:58,649 --> 00:25:00,406
He's so, you know, up-to-date.

250
00:25:00,598 --> 00:25:02,402
- Well, he has the money,

251
00:25:02,594 --> 00:25:04,514
he's healthy. Why not be up-to-date?

252
00:25:04,706 --> 00:25:06,041
- Knock on the wood...

253
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:08,287
- Don't worry, I'm not a hoodoo.

254
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:10,610
- I'm not superstitious, too, it was just a reflex.

255
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:12,204
- So, is he divorced? Any kids?

256
00:25:12,396 --> 00:25:13,606
- Yeah. Divorces 3 years ago.

257
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:16,140
The daughter is grown-up, she's studying abroad,

258
00:25:16,332 --> 00:25:17,369
in Portugal, I think.

259
00:25:17,561 --> 00:25:18,492
And works there, too.

260
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:19,606
- And how old is he?

261
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:20,873
-47.

262
00:25:21,324 --> 00:25:22,601
- He's looking good.

263
00:25:22,793 --> 00:25:24,502
- He does some Chinese exercises.

264
00:25:24,694 --> 00:25:26,393
Doesn't smoke, almost doesn't drink.

265
00:25:26,585 --> 00:25:28,726
- I'm even jealous.

266
00:25:28,918 --> 00:25:31,394
So, I even it up?
- Just a bit.

267
00:25:34,265 --> 00:25:36,185
- And how does he feel about your boy?

268
00:25:36,377 --> 00:25:37,500
- Nothing particular.

269
00:25:37,692 --> 00:25:39,986
Looks like this boy of mine hates me.

270
00:25:40,178 --> 00:25:41,954
He's just like his father.

271
00:25:42,146 --> 00:25:43,730
Even starts to smell like him.

272
00:25:43,922 --> 00:25:46,034
- Secondary sexual characteristics,
he's growing up.

273
00:25:46,226 --> 00:25:48,588
And did you want him to stay an angel
all the time?

274
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,132
- He may look like an angel,
- Oh, hi, will you wait?

275
00:25:51,324 --> 00:25:53,062
- But he's actually all so spiky,

276
00:25:53,254 --> 00:25:56,038
he almost tore me during childbirth -
didn't want to get out.

277
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:58,025
I was delivering almost 24-hours.

278
00:25:58,322 --> 00:26:01,087
- Yeah, the life is hard...

279
00:26:02,556 --> 00:26:04,284
Just like my tyke.

280
00:26:04,476 --> 00:26:06,876
Everytime I look at her I realize a sad fact

281
00:26:07,068 --> 00:26:08,412
that she's just like her father.

282
00:26:08,604 --> 00:26:10,524
I hope he died there in his Kapotnya.

283
00:26:10,716 --> 00:26:11,417
- Look.

284
00:26:14,076 --> 00:26:14,950
- Yeah...

285
00:26:15,142 --> 00:26:16,918
But you know, she doesn't drink.

286
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,596
I told her that I'll kill her immediately.

287
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:21,324
She's a girl of a character.

288
00:26:21,516 --> 00:26:23,590
But not like her father, more like his mother.

289
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:24,502
She's such a bitch.

290
00:26:24,694 --> 00:26:26,258
- I forgot, how old is your daughter?

291
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,505
-19, but she's real stupid.

292
00:26:28,697 --> 00:26:29,868
Well no, she's smart,

293
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,385
she finished the school, exams,

294
00:26:31,577 --> 00:26:34,486
but doesn't want to study anymore,
no matter what you do.

295
00:26:34,582 --> 00:26:36,358
All she wants is to roam around.

296
00:26:36,626 --> 00:26:39,257
I tell her: "If you get pregnant, your life is ruined.

297
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:41,830
Don't count on me".
And she says: "I have safe sex".

298
00:26:42,002 --> 00:26:43,423
- Well, at least that.

299
00:26:44,057 --> 00:26:46,313
- I don't know how she'll live further.

300
00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:48,578
No profession, no desire whatsoever.

301
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:51,238
I tell her: "Who do you want to be?"
"A member of Parliament".

302
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,292
I say: "Study while you still have time".

303
00:26:53,983 --> 00:26:56,076
She says: "You don't need to study to be an MP".

304
00:26:56,268 --> 00:26:56,950
What can I say.

305
00:26:57,142 --> 00:26:58,610
- So your daughter is clever!

306
00:26:58,802 --> 00:27:00,281
- It's because she's just like me.

307
00:27:14,748 --> 00:27:15,631
- Yes?

308
00:27:15,996 --> 00:27:17,551
- Zhenya, come downstairs, please.

309
00:27:17,743 --> 00:27:18,492
- Mhm.

310
00:27:40,841 --> 00:27:42,953
- Why you don't tell me anything?

311
00:27:43,145 --> 00:27:44,239
- What do you mean?

312
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:47,657
- How did it go with the flat yesterday,
what did the buyers say?

313
00:27:47,906 --> 00:27:49,519
- They said they'll think.

314
00:27:50,287 --> 00:27:51,276
Eh, Masha,

315
00:27:51,468 --> 00:27:54,790
if there was any progress,
I would have certainly told you.

316
00:27:54,982 --> 00:27:56,892
- Why can't you sell it for all this time?

317
00:27:57,084 --> 00:27:58,994
Aren't you working in the Sales Department?

318
00:28:00,866 --> 00:28:03,746
- You realize that those are
different things, don't you?

319
00:28:04,034 --> 00:28:05,254
- No, I don't.

320
00:28:05,446 --> 00:28:08,364
Don't take the pelmeni,
my mom said no pelmeni.

321
00:28:09,516 --> 00:28:11,436
- Where's she tonight? At home?

322
00:28:11,983 --> 00:28:13,164
- Oh,

323
00:28:13,356 --> 00:28:14,892
she left for her auntie.

324
00:28:15,209 --> 00:28:16,812
I got tired of her myself.

325
00:28:17,302 --> 00:28:18,780
Tonight we're alone.

326
00:28:18,972 --> 00:28:20,220
- Thank God.

327
00:28:20,546 --> 00:28:22,985
- How can you say that? She's my mother!

328
00:28:23,542 --> 00:28:24,905
Hey, go take the broccoli.

329
00:28:31,634 --> 00:28:34,092
-1275, please.

330
00:29:32,431 --> 00:29:33,410
- Borya.

331
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:32,354
Wait.

332
00:32:34,265 --> 00:32:37,279
Everything is going to be alright with us, right?

333
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:41,945
You won't leave us, right?

334
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,702
- What?

335
00:32:44,815 --> 00:32:46,735
Masha...

336
00:32:47,417 --> 00:32:48,713
Are you crazy?

337
00:32:48,905 --> 00:32:51,132
Where do those thoughts come from?

338
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:54,127
- I just sometimes get so scared...

339
00:32:57,967 --> 00:32:59,887
- I'm with you.

340
00:33:02,162 --> 00:33:04,975
- You must have been saying the same
to your ex-wife.

341
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:11,330
- Me and you, we are a completely
different story.

342
00:33:11,618 --> 00:33:14,210
There was no one who made me feel so happy.

343
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:19,711
- And how many were there?

344
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:27,199
More than 10?

345
00:33:27,391 --> 00:33:29,311
- I'm quite hungry, what about you?

346
00:33:30,233 --> 00:33:32,690
- I'm always hungry these days.

347
00:33:33,372 --> 00:33:34,678
By the way, I feel offended.

348
00:33:34,927 --> 00:33:36,866
- I'll go cook something.

349
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:40,438
- Bring me an apple.

350
00:33:53,686 --> 00:33:54,934
- Catch it.

351
00:33:57,314 --> 00:33:59,916
Boiled chicken and broccoli, huh?

352
00:34:00,108 --> 00:34:01,231
- I don't want.

353
00:34:01,836 --> 00:34:03,910
I want a salad with cucumbers and tomatoes.

354
00:34:04,188 --> 00:34:06,204
- Wow, a salad with cucumbers and tomatoes...

355
00:34:20,345 --> 00:34:23,446
- "Got a tooth pulled in a dream. What does it mean?"

356
00:34:36,924 --> 00:34:38,652
- Hi!
- Hi.

357
00:34:38,844 --> 00:34:40,457
- Why are you so early?

358
00:34:40,764 --> 00:34:43,490
I was expecting you later,
I barely managed to get off work.

359
00:34:43,913 --> 00:34:45,410
My girls didn't want me to leave.

360
00:34:46,025 --> 00:34:48,041
There are still lots of customers.

361
00:34:48,137 --> 00:34:49,644
So, where are we going?

362
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:50,902
M?

363
00:34:51,775 --> 00:34:52,409
Why are you silent?

364
00:34:52,601 --> 00:34:55,481
Come on and tell me where we are going
this time!

365
00:34:56,009 --> 00:34:59,119
Look, can we first get a watermelon on the way?

366
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,626
- Young lady,

367
00:35:12,818 --> 00:35:14,738
do you have a second to tell me your number?

368
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,658
8-9...?

369
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:18,790
-25

370
00:35:18,982 --> 00:35:20,249
16078

371
00:35:20,441 --> 00:35:21,516
88.

372
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:23,042
- And your name?

373
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:24,463
- Sofia.

374
00:36:08,844 --> 00:36:11,638
- I can't eat when I'm observed like that.

375
00:36:12,108 --> 00:36:13,279
- Sorry.

376
00:36:15,046 --> 00:36:16,966
- Okay, I was kidding.

377
00:36:19,634 --> 00:36:21,554
- You got new hair cut, or is it just me?

378
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:23,398
- You noticed.

379
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,473
- Of course.

380
00:36:25,097 --> 00:36:27,017
I'm looking closely at you.

381
00:36:27,209 --> 00:36:28,937
- You still are?

382
00:36:29,743 --> 00:36:31,663
After all we've done?

383
00:36:34,745 --> 00:36:36,569
- Especially after all we've done.

384
00:36:39,314 --> 00:36:41,810
- After what we've done
the day before yesterday?

385
00:36:44,431 --> 00:36:46,735
Or the day before
the day before yesterday?

386
00:36:46,927 --> 00:36:47,254
- Zhenya...

387
00:36:48,713 --> 00:36:49,634
- What?

388
00:36:50,633 --> 00:36:52,217
What's the matter?

389
00:36:53,234 --> 00:36:54,511
Something's wrong?

390
00:37:01,231 --> 00:37:03,535
[Voices in the background, suggesting to have a drink]

391
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:05,503
- Girls, let's drink for love!

392
00:37:05,695 --> 00:37:06,886
For love!

393
00:37:07,078 --> 00:37:08,902
- You my beauties!

394
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:11,071
Let's make a selfie!

395
00:37:11,263 --> 00:37:13,241
- For love and selfie!

396
00:39:58,966 --> 00:39:59,916
- Hey?

397
00:40:08,431 --> 00:40:09,871
You're asleep?

398
00:40:19,231 --> 00:40:21,151
It's not fair.

399
00:40:37,711 --> 00:40:39,286
I love you.

400
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:41,887
Do you hear?

401
00:40:48,502 --> 00:40:50,422
I never loved anyone.

402
00:40:53,071 --> 00:40:55,452
Only my mother when I was a child.

403
00:40:56,642 --> 00:40:58,850
And she was so blunt with me.

404
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,519
Never caressed.

405
00:41:01,711 --> 00:41:04,015
Never said a kind word.

406
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:09,900
Only the discipline, the order, the studying.

407
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,414
Wicked and lonely wretch.

408
00:41:14,018 --> 00:41:16,217
- She is alive and well, I hope?

409
00:41:17,234 --> 00:41:18,559
- Alive.

410
00:41:19,836 --> 00:41:22,418
And actually quite healthy.

411
00:41:26,892 --> 00:41:28,812
We don't talk much.

412
00:41:29,916 --> 00:41:32,172
Every time I call we end up in a scandal.

413
00:41:32,374 --> 00:41:34,822
Even later on, I cannot understand why.

414
00:41:35,014 --> 00:41:36,742
Who started it.

415
00:41:55,078 --> 00:41:57,766
Only with you I realized what love is.

416
00:42:00,358 --> 00:42:02,278
I didn't love my husband.

417
00:42:04,198 --> 00:42:06,118
And before him I had no one.

418
00:42:08,134 --> 00:42:10,668
And even with him, I got pregnant by mistake.

419
00:42:13,471 --> 00:42:16,351
He was so happy, suggested to get married.

420
00:42:17,071 --> 00:42:19,212
"Everything is fine, we're together".

421
00:42:20,594 --> 00:42:22,514
But I didn't want that.

422
00:42:25,298 --> 00:42:26,930
I was so scared.

423
00:42:31,058 --> 00:42:34,466
I was afraid to do the abortion,
I was afraid to keep it.

424
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:38,998
Didn't want it so much.

425
00:42:45,036 --> 00:42:47,686
When I was delivering I thought I was gonna die.

426
00:42:47,743 --> 00:42:49,270
They had me in critical care.

427
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:53,311
And then, when they brought him,

428
00:42:54,233 --> 00:42:56,460
I couldn't even look at him.

429
00:42:57,631 --> 00:42:59,878
Like some kind of disgust.

430
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:05,878
I even didn't have milk.

431
00:43:18,521 --> 00:43:20,095
Later it somehow got better,

432
00:43:20,287 --> 00:43:21,996
some life started.

433
00:43:22,774 --> 00:43:24,358
Some.

434
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,900
- Un-love.

435
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,068
- You can't live in un-love.

436
00:43:44,556 --> 00:43:46,716
- Even now, when I look at him or think about him,

437
00:43:46,908 --> 00:43:48,636
like right now,

438
00:43:50,057 --> 00:43:53,398
it seems like I have made
some unforgivable mistake.

439
00:43:57,650 --> 00:43:59,570
I blame him and I blame myself.

440
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:07,606
How much do I want to be happy!

441
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:14,489
I'm a bitch, ain't I?

442
00:44:14,863 --> 00:44:16,409
- Of course.

443
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:23,772
You're the loveliest bitch in the world.

444
00:44:31,193 --> 00:44:33,113
- You really love me?

445
00:44:35,033 --> 00:44:36,194
- Come to me.

446
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:08,412
- Yeah, hello.

447
00:48:08,604 --> 00:48:10,524
- Did you see Alyosha yesterday evening?

448
00:48:11,234 --> 00:48:13,154
- No, I didn't come home last night. Why?

449
00:48:13,817 --> 00:48:14,969
- The school called right now,

450
00:48:15,161 --> 00:48:17,407
they said he wasn't there
neither today not yesterday.

451
00:48:17,676 --> 00:48:18,982
- What do you mean?

452
00:48:19,174 --> 00:48:20,441
And who called?

453
00:48:20,633 --> 00:48:21,900
- The head teacher.

454
00:48:22,975 --> 00:48:23,887
- The head teacher?

455
00:48:24,252 --> 00:48:25,087
And what did she say?

456
00:48:25,308 --> 00:48:26,258
- That he wasn't there!

457
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:28,831
Neither today, not yesterday! Are you deaf or what?

458
00:48:29,254 --> 00:48:30,079
- Had he been in at home?

459
00:48:30,271 --> 00:48:31,394
- I don't know!

460
00:48:33,314 --> 00:48:35,570
I came yesterday at night,
I thought he's sleeping.

461
00:48:35,762 --> 00:48:37,385
Woke up late today.

462
00:48:37,577 --> 00:48:39,737
I thought he's already left, as usually.

463
00:48:39,756 --> 00:48:41,734
His phone is off, has he called you?

464
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:42,943
- No.

465
00:48:44,863 --> 00:48:45,900
- Dear God...

466
00:48:46,514 --> 00:48:48,598
- Stop panicking, he'll come back,
what else will he do.

467
00:48:49,241 --> 00:48:50,758
We need to call that...

468
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:51,890
the friend of his.

469
00:48:52,082 --> 00:48:53,580
- I already have, he hadn't seen him either.

470
00:48:53,772 --> 00:48:54,866
Neither today, not yesterday.

471
00:48:56,114 --> 00:48:57,036
- I see.

472
00:48:59,062 --> 00:49:00,338
And where are you now?

473
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:01,817
- At home, where else.

474
00:49:02,143 --> 00:49:04,870
- And you fuckin cannot understand if he
had been home or not?

475
00:49:05,062 --> 00:49:06,300
- I damn cannot!

476
00:49:06,492 --> 00:49:07,289
- Why?

477
00:49:07,615 --> 00:49:08,729
It's easy.

478
00:49:09,017 --> 00:49:11,378
- Then come and see yourself!

479
00:49:13,298 --> 00:49:15,218
- I'm at work, in case you didn't know.

480
00:49:15,343 --> 00:49:17,580
- We haven't heard of him
for more than 24-hours,

481
00:49:17,734 --> 00:49:18,751
do you get this or not?

482
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:22,783
- Maybe he's in the elevator
right now, for example.

483
00:49:23,945 --> 00:49:25,865
I think you're exaggerating.

484
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:27,794
He must have done something

485
00:49:27,986 --> 00:49:30,118
and is afraid now that
you'll give him a beating.

486
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:32,038
That's why he's roaming around somewhere...

487
00:49:32,882 --> 00:49:34,802
- So, I'm at fault now, right?

488
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,202
- You even...

489
00:49:37,394 --> 00:49:40,649
You don't even know if he had been at home or not.

490
00:49:42,953 --> 00:49:44,873
He probably had.

491
00:49:46,793 --> 00:49:47,724
Hello?

492
00:49:51,564 --> 00:49:52,274
Hello?

493
00:49:53,177 --> 00:49:54,578
- Listen.

494
00:49:55,068 --> 00:49:56,834
I'm calling the police right now,

495
00:49:57,026 --> 00:49:58,591
and you can keep sitting at your work

496
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:00,732
and speculate what may had been
and what may not.

497
00:50:00,924 --> 00:50:01,807
Got it?

498
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:02,882
Blockhead!

499
00:50:28,534 --> 00:50:29,647
- Dasha, look,

500
00:50:30,098 --> 00:50:31,826
one office worker

501
00:50:32,018 --> 00:50:33,938
says to another office worker:

502
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:35,686
"What car do you have?"

503
00:50:35,878 --> 00:50:37,241
"Volkswagen Passat"

504
00:50:37,433 --> 00:50:38,892
"And I have Volkswagen Credit"

505
00:50:40,015 --> 00:50:41,935
- So funny.

506
00:50:42,636 --> 00:50:43,615
- Look,

507
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:44,690
one office worker...

508
00:50:44,882 --> 00:50:46,802
- Wait wait wait, Seryozha...

509
00:50:49,548 --> 00:50:50,527
- It was funny.

510
00:51:24,703 --> 00:51:25,826
- I've finished.

511
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:28,102
- Good, thank you.

512
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:30,022
Take that.

513
00:51:32,844 --> 00:51:35,983
Wait for me in the car,
we have one more call.

514
00:51:36,175 --> 00:51:36,876
- Okay.

515
00:51:37,874 --> 00:51:39,372
- What can I say.

516
00:51:39,564 --> 00:51:41,071
I see no crime here.

517
00:51:41,858 --> 00:51:43,183
- What crime?

518
00:51:43,855 --> 00:51:45,122
- You know, sometimes

519
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:46,898
the parents finish off their child

520
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:49,010
and then claim that the child got lost.

521
00:51:49,634 --> 00:51:51,228
- You thought that way about me?

522
00:51:51,439 --> 00:51:53,849
- That's the version we check the first.

523
00:51:54,242 --> 00:51:55,826
Here we have a "runner", the usual case.

524
00:51:56,018 --> 00:51:57,314
12 years old, a rebel-heart,

525
00:51:57,506 --> 00:51:58,505
full of hormones.

526
00:51:58,697 --> 00:52:01,375
He'll roam around for a couple of days
and will come back.

527
00:52:01,884 --> 00:52:04,006
Well, we can, of course, go to the Department,

528
00:52:04,198 --> 00:52:06,329
spend a couple of hours filling a detailed form -

529
00:52:06,521 --> 00:52:08,249
and probably already not today.

530
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:11,417
At least because your husband
must be present as well.

531
00:52:12,434 --> 00:52:13,788
And even then,

532
00:52:14,268 --> 00:52:17,282
I think this case won't go further
than the material checking.

533
00:52:20,969 --> 00:52:22,889
- You say there's no crime.

534
00:52:24,156 --> 00:52:25,798
And what if he was kidnapped?

535
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:27,622
Cause I can't even imagine

536
00:52:27,814 --> 00:52:28,793
where he can be now.

537
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:31,433
- He must be roaming somewhere around the block.

538
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:33,161
He won't last long.

539
00:52:33,353 --> 00:52:36,002
He's used to the comfort, and it's right here.

540
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:39,612
They come back to such families
that you couldn't even imagine.

541
00:52:39,804 --> 00:52:42,857
Cause the street is not a home,
no matter how shitty the latter is.

542
00:52:42,924 --> 00:52:44,844
And considering the kidnapping,

543
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,303
This is how it goes:

544
00:52:46,495 --> 00:52:48,415
First, there's the material checking. It means:

545
00:52:48,607 --> 00:52:50,767
Examining the parents, relatives,

546
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,879
friends, possible witnesses and so on.

547
00:52:53,071 --> 00:52:54,886
We don't have enough staff for it.

548
00:52:55,078 --> 00:52:57,266
Plus, there are a lot of other cases -

549
00:52:57,458 --> 00:52:59,647
robberies, murders, burglaries, thuggery.

550
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,353
Thus, collecting materials can last
a couple of days.

551
00:53:03,545 --> 00:53:06,118
If by then the "runner" doesn't come back,

552
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:08,508
the searching operations begin.

553
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,831
And if during them we find reasons,

554
00:53:11,023 --> 00:53:14,287
i.e. factual evidence of murder or kidnapping,

555
00:53:14,479 --> 00:53:16,380
then criminal proceedings are initiated.

556
00:53:16,572 --> 00:53:18,991
But it is initiated by
the investigating committee.

557
00:53:19,183 --> 00:53:21,612
You know yourself, how long can it take.

558
00:53:22,217 --> 00:53:23,858
The writing itself takes forever.

559
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:25,500
During this time they usually

560
00:53:25,692 --> 00:53:27,132
come back and run away again.

561
00:53:27,353 --> 00:53:29,052
- So, you won't do anything, right?

562
00:53:29,071 --> 00:53:32,047
- Ma'am, I'm explaining the real situation.

563
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:34,015
We must react and we will.

564
00:53:34,207 --> 00:53:35,791
But in this particular case

565
00:53:35,983 --> 00:53:39,305
we physically don't have time or staff
to keep chasing every teenager.

566
00:53:39,545 --> 00:53:40,774
- I got it.

567
00:53:41,225 --> 00:53:43,548
The case will be thrown to a trash-bin, right?

568
00:53:44,124 --> 00:53:44,844
And what do I do?

569
00:53:45,036 --> 00:53:46,726
Just sit and wait till he returns?

570
00:53:46,918 --> 00:53:48,607
And what if he doesn't return?

571
00:53:48,818 --> 00:53:50,527
- Facts are stubborn things...

572
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,871
In most cases

573
00:53:52,063 --> 00:53:54,857
the teenage "runners" come back
in a week's time,

574
00:53:55,049 --> 00:53:56,777
in 10 days at most.

575
00:53:58,073 --> 00:53:59,522
What I can advise is,

576
00:53:59,714 --> 00:54:01,778
If you really want to start looking for him,

577
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:02,902
go to the internet,

578
00:54:03,094 --> 00:54:05,906
to the web-page of the search-and-rescue squad,

579
00:54:06,751 --> 00:54:08,642
call them, give them all the information,

580
00:54:08,834 --> 00:54:10,543
they'll tell which information they need.

581
00:54:10,735 --> 00:54:13,375
They are volunteers, not a government service.

582
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:16,601
They work 24-hours, for free,

583
00:54:16,793 --> 00:54:18,713
without any bureaucracy,

584
00:54:18,905 --> 00:54:21,727
A well-developed highly-efficient
algorithm of actions.

585
00:54:22,226 --> 00:54:25,414
Where do I know from?
Have been collaborating, productively.

586
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:29,330
Look, here's my card.

587
00:54:30,588 --> 00:54:32,316
Your phone number

588
00:54:32,508 --> 00:54:35,042
has already been written down,
we'll stay in touch.

589
00:54:35,436 --> 00:54:36,751
- Is that it?

590
00:54:36,943 --> 00:54:38,258
- For now, yes.

591
00:54:39,113 --> 00:54:40,390
- Unreal.

592
00:54:40,582 --> 00:54:41,676
- Listen.

593
00:54:41,868 --> 00:54:44,114
If it were any other officer,

594
00:54:44,306 --> 00:54:46,918
it would have been
much harsher and less informative.

595
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:48,838
And it's not because I'm so kind.

596
00:54:49,212 --> 00:54:51,948
It's because I save my time, yours
and volunteers'.

597
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:53,628
Who will start searching

598
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,126
the sooner you contact them.

599
00:54:55,318 --> 00:54:59,830
And they will find your fool
somewhere in the streets or in a mall.

600
00:55:00,022 --> 00:55:01,759
And most probably, at some place of his friend's,

601
00:55:01,951 --> 00:55:05,081
whose parents went away for a day or two
so that he's alone now.

602
00:55:05,743 --> 00:55:06,886
So, take actions.

603
00:55:07,078 --> 00:55:10,178
Or keep waiting, it's up to you.

604
00:56:06,406 --> 00:56:08,326
- When have you spoken to him last time?

605
00:56:08,518 --> 00:56:10,812
- I just saw him leaving for school.

606
00:56:11,705 --> 00:56:13,625
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

607
00:56:13,942 --> 00:56:15,324
- I'm sorry, there are traffic jams.

608
00:56:15,967 --> 00:56:18,463
- Take a seat, engage yourself,
my name's Ivan,

609
00:56:18,655 --> 00:56:21,151
I'm the coordinator
of the search-and-rescue squad.

610
00:56:21,343 --> 00:56:23,138
- Yes, my wife told me on the phone.

611
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:25,874
- Great. Then, let's start. I mean, continue.

612
00:56:26,066 --> 00:56:29,090
So, I say it one more time
so that there are fewer questions.

613
00:56:29,282 --> 00:56:32,124
Now I'm going to carefully ask you
about your son, Alyosha,

614
00:56:32,316 --> 00:56:35,830
while other searchers are surveying
the neighbours, possible witnesses,

615
00:56:35,849 --> 00:56:38,978
on the streets, in the shops,
everywhere where he could have been seen.

616
00:56:39,218 --> 00:56:39,583
Yes, Lena?

617
00:56:39,775 --> 00:56:41,196
- The neighbours got nothing.

618
00:56:41,388 --> 00:56:41,820
- Nothing at all?

619
00:56:42,012 --> 00:56:44,345
- Nobody has seen him, neither yesterday, not today.

620
00:56:44,393 --> 00:56:45,343
They can't remember.

621
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:48,204
There are more of us now, in the parking place.

622
00:56:48,396 --> 00:56:50,095
- Good.
- And we have the posters now.

623
00:56:50,287 --> 00:56:51,593
- Oh, got printed? Good job.

624
00:56:51,785 --> 00:56:53,023
- I'll continue with the neighbours.

625
00:56:53,215 --> 00:56:54,684
- Keep surveying.

626
00:56:54,876 --> 00:56:57,046
Right.

627
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:59,532
Depending on the results of the survey,

628
00:56:59,724 --> 00:57:01,913
we'll focus on particular objects and tasks.

629
00:57:02,105 --> 00:57:04,438
We finish with you now
and to to the police department.

630
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:05,945
Your detective officer promised

631
00:57:06,137 --> 00:57:08,758
to help out with the security cam footage.

632
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:11,570
It's very important and it may help us a lot.

633
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:12,761
Next.

634
00:57:12,953 --> 00:57:15,833
Since the night is coming,
the guy needs to sleep somewhere.

635
00:57:16,025 --> 00:57:17,446
It's not summer outside.

636
00:57:17,638 --> 00:57:19,058
We'll search the doorways.

637
00:57:19,961 --> 00:57:23,359
We'll ask the same officer for the door-codes,
hopefully he won't refuse.

638
00:57:23,801 --> 00:57:26,450
So. From the very beginning.

639
00:57:26,998 --> 00:57:28,246
Alyosha Sleptsov.

640
00:57:28,438 --> 00:57:29,494
12 years old,

641
00:57:29,686 --> 00:57:32,066
around 1 m 50 cm tall.

642
00:57:32,258 --> 00:57:34,610
Healthy, no specific marks.

643
00:57:34,802 --> 00:57:35,782
Blond hair.

644
00:57:35,974 --> 00:57:39,161
was wearing blue jeans,
a red jacket with a hoodie,

645
00:57:39,353 --> 00:57:40,332
blue sneakers.

646
00:57:40,524 --> 00:57:43,154
Had a blue schoolbag.

647
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:48,166
Left the house yesterday, as usually.
Hasn't come back since, as it seems.

648
00:57:48,358 --> 00:57:51,372
The mobile phone is off
but we keep calling nevertheless.

649
00:57:52,908 --> 00:57:54,415
Got it. Next.

650
00:57:54,607 --> 00:57:57,132
Tell me, what kind of hobbies does the boy have?

651
00:57:57,324 --> 00:58:00,790
Any sport clubs, maybe planning to go
building a spaceport,

652
00:58:00,982 --> 00:58:02,354
traveling around the world and so on.

653
00:58:02,546 --> 00:58:05,590
- No, nothing like that,
doesn't do sports.

654
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:07,807
I think, he sits at home usually.

655
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:09,535
- "You think"? I see.

656
00:58:09,727 --> 00:58:11,647
If so, then he has a computer?

657
00:58:12,185 --> 00:58:13,452
Is his laptop on the table?
- Yes.

658
00:58:13,644 --> 00:58:16,121
- Yeah, we're trying to limit the...
- Especially you do.

659
00:58:16,313 --> 00:58:20,124
- Look, you can discuss your relations later, okay?
- Yes, sorry.

660
00:58:20,316 --> 00:58:22,332
- Have you got the access to the computer?
- Yes.

661
00:58:22,342 --> 00:58:25,327
- Get the access to his e-mail, to the accounts
in the social networks,

662
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:28,265
addresses of his friends, girlfriends, buddies.

663
00:58:28,457 --> 00:58:29,695
- He has only one friend.

664
00:58:30,156 --> 00:58:31,615
Kuznetsov, I think.

665
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:33,343
- Mhm.

666
00:58:33,535 --> 00:58:35,263
"You think", again? Alright.

667
00:58:35,455 --> 00:58:37,279
- I have all his logins and passwords,

668
00:58:37,471 --> 00:58:39,295
he really has only one friend - Kuznetsov,

669
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:41,638
in real life, I mean.

670
00:58:42,214 --> 00:58:44,585
In the social networks...
- Yeah, I got it.

671
00:58:44,777 --> 00:58:47,801
Okay. The closest relatives where he could go to?

672
00:58:47,993 --> 00:58:50,662
Grannies, grandpas, uncles, ants, cousins?

673
00:58:50,854 --> 00:58:53,350
- My husband has none, I have a mother
she lives in the Moscow region.

674
00:58:53,542 --> 00:58:56,038
- We haven't been there for 3 years,
I don't think the brat remembers.

675
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:58,226
- "The brat"? I see.

676
00:58:58,418 --> 00:59:01,452
I hope you called the granny
and she said he's not there?

677
00:59:01,644 --> 00:59:02,681
- No, I can't reach her.

678
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:04,649
You know, our relations are very...

679
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:06,425
- What do you mean, you can't reach her?

680
00:59:06,617 --> 00:59:09,506
- She wasn't answering at first
then became out of reach.

681
00:59:09,698 --> 00:59:10,466
The phone-line is quite bad there.

682
00:59:10,658 --> 00:59:12,578
- The phone-line is good, the woman is quite insane.

683
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:15,746
- Mm. The granny with a spirit?
- Mhm.

684
00:59:15,938 --> 00:59:17,196
- Did you call the neighbours?

685
00:59:17,388 --> 00:59:18,454
- No, I have no phone number.

686
00:59:18,646 --> 00:59:21,948
- It's her house, her area, the neighbours...

687
00:59:22,514 --> 00:59:24,972
It's better to stay away, or else...
- What if she's hiding

688
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:28,025
that Alyosha is there,
if he asks her to do so, for example.

689
00:59:28,217 --> 00:59:29,388
- No, I don't think so.

690
00:59:29,762 --> 00:59:31,999
- She can do anything,
she's a female Stalin.

691
00:59:32,191 --> 00:59:33,026
- Enough!

692
00:59:33,218 --> 00:59:34,975
We went there only by car,
How is he gonna get there?

693
00:59:35,167 --> 00:59:36,924
- What if she'd been secretly
communicating with him?

694
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:39,026
Ain't it possible?
- She doesn't love him!

695
00:59:39,122 --> 00:59:42,434
- Loves, doesn't love. She used him
as a tool against me.

696
00:59:42,626 --> 00:59:45,180
- Look, we must go to your granny urgently.

697
00:59:45,372 --> 00:59:46,572
Where exactly does she live?

698
00:59:46,764 --> 00:59:48,290
- In a summer house, all the time.

699
00:59:48,482 --> 00:59:49,385
Kiev direction.

700
00:59:49,577 --> 00:59:50,892
It's not easy to explain,

701
00:59:51,084 --> 00:59:53,004
there's a small side-road from the highway.

702
00:59:53,196 --> 00:59:54,665
- But you're with a car?
- Yes.

703
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:55,817
- How long till there?

704
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:58,351
- Around 3 hours, maybe 2,5.

705
00:59:58,543 --> 00:59:59,686
- Here's what we do.

706
00:59:59,878 --> 01:00:02,134
You give me all the contacts
of his friends and fellows,

707
01:00:02,326 --> 01:00:04,802
including the phone of the head teacher.

708
01:00:05,148 --> 01:00:06,530
I hope you have it?

709
01:00:06,722 --> 01:00:09,372
- We do...
- Great, also all the logins and passwords.

710
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:14,258
I take the computer with me to the headquarters.
After that, we act according to the situation.

711
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:17,330
Meanwhile you... Is it the head teacher's?

712
01:00:17,522 --> 01:00:18,694
Good.

713
01:00:18,886 --> 01:00:21,564
Meanwhile, you two jump into the car

714
01:00:21,756 --> 01:00:24,242
and head to your wonderful granny.

715
01:00:24,434 --> 01:00:27,122
Lena joins you, you saw her.
She's our experienced searcher.

716
01:00:27,314 --> 01:00:29,292
She'll be behind you, she has a car.

717
01:00:29,484 --> 01:00:32,076
On the way, try reaching the granny nevertheless.

718
01:00:32,191 --> 01:00:34,870
When you arrive, inspect everything carefully,
don't miss anything.

719
01:00:35,062 --> 01:00:37,874
Report me the results immediately,
no matter what they are.

720
01:00:38,066 --> 01:00:39,046
Understood?
- Yes.

721
01:00:39,238 --> 01:00:40,591
- Will you manage?

722
01:00:40,783 --> 01:00:42,137
Any questions?

723
01:00:42,454 --> 01:00:46,572
We'll leave someone here at the flat,
in case the boy comes back.

724
01:00:46,889 --> 01:00:49,356
So, shall we start?

725
01:00:49,548 --> 01:00:50,748
Let's go!

726
01:01:05,455 --> 01:01:06,828
- Damn you...

727
01:01:07,846 --> 01:01:09,583
Can you switch that off, my head aches!

728
01:01:09,775 --> 01:01:11,503
- There's a pill in the glove compartment.

729
01:01:11,695 --> 01:01:13,615
- Switch off! Please!

730
01:01:26,201 --> 01:01:28,054
You think he's at her place?

731
01:01:28,246 --> 01:01:30,089
- Where else? Think about it.

732
01:01:37,289 --> 01:01:39,574
What a mess has he made...

733
01:01:40,082 --> 01:01:41,446
Chose a good time, little shit.

734
01:01:41,638 --> 01:01:45,276
- What if something horrible happened to him?
- Let's not even think this way.

735
01:01:46,236 --> 01:01:48,156
He's completely alright.

736
01:01:49,279 --> 01:01:52,159
Just wait, he'll get what he deserves.

737
01:01:53,686 --> 01:01:55,404
You can't smoke here.

738
01:01:55,596 --> 01:01:57,122
- How could I forget.

739
01:01:57,314 --> 01:01:59,234
I'll smoke out of the window.
- I said don't!

740
01:02:00,617 --> 01:02:03,439
- What will you do? Throw me onto the road?

741
01:02:04,505 --> 01:02:06,425
- So, your head stopped aching, right?

742
01:02:07,874 --> 01:02:09,170
- Raise the windows.

743
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:13,471
Raise the windows!

744
01:02:16,802 --> 01:02:18,166
Bitch!

745
01:02:20,124 --> 01:02:22,543
Raise the goddamned windows!

746
01:02:23,177 --> 01:02:24,809
AAA!

747
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:08,566
- Wow.

748
01:03:08,969 --> 01:03:10,889
They've put the gates.

749
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:13,289
What are we supposed to do?
To ram into them?

750
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:13,874
She must be constructing barricades there.

751
01:04:14,066 --> 01:04:15,209
- Stop making a monster out of her.

752
01:04:15,401 --> 01:04:16,850
- Is there another way in?

753
01:04:17,042 --> 01:04:18,492
- Except over the fence.

754
01:04:19,318 --> 01:04:20,969
- We don't have the keys.

755
01:04:21,161 --> 01:04:22,121
- Got it.

756
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:26,066
- Where did she...

757
01:04:41,138 --> 01:04:42,070
- Thanks...

758
01:04:46,399 --> 01:04:47,206
- Mom!

759
01:04:50,508 --> 01:04:52,572
Mom, open up, it's me!

760
01:04:55,865 --> 01:04:56,998
Mom!

761
01:05:02,182 --> 01:05:03,046
Mom!

762
01:05:07,289 --> 01:05:08,806
- She's inside.

763
01:05:09,996 --> 01:05:13,212
- Mom, open up, Alyosha is missing.

764
01:05:15,132 --> 01:05:17,052
- Dear Lord,

765
01:05:17,906 --> 01:05:19,769
Almost had a heart attack.

766
01:05:19,961 --> 01:05:21,122
First they call

767
01:05:21,314 --> 01:05:23,839
in the middle of the night,
like during a fire,

768
01:05:24,031 --> 01:05:25,759
then I see them climbing over the fence!

769
01:05:25,951 --> 01:05:28,178
Oh Lord, God save us all...

770
01:05:28,370 --> 01:05:30,415
That can drive anyone crazy!

771
01:05:30,607 --> 01:05:33,007
And most importantly,
I cannot find my phone.

772
01:05:35,878 --> 01:05:37,798
How can I survive!

773
01:05:39,295 --> 01:05:41,023
You could have warned, at least!

774
01:05:41,215 --> 01:05:43,673
- I kept calling all day, don't tell me you didn't hear.

775
01:05:43,865 --> 01:05:44,940
- I swear!

776
01:05:45,113 --> 01:05:46,831
- First, you didn't answer, then switched it off.

777
01:05:47,023 --> 01:05:50,191
- I'm telling you, I don't know where it is!
Must have lost it somewhere.

778
01:05:50,383 --> 01:05:52,639
Cannot find it since morning. Well, screw it!

779
01:05:52,831 --> 01:05:55,039
You better tell me, my dear,

780
01:05:55,231 --> 01:05:57,785
why have you decided
that your kiddo is at my place, huh?

781
01:06:04,601 --> 01:06:07,058
- He's not here. Feels like he has never been.

782
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:08,556
- We'll check everything.

783
01:06:28,447 --> 01:06:29,820
- Where is he wandering?

784
01:06:30,012 --> 01:06:32,566
Your goddamned dickwad. God bless us all...

785
01:06:32,758 --> 01:06:34,486
You said you're divorcing, didn't you?

786
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:37,231
- You curse and pray in the same package...

787
01:06:37,423 --> 01:06:40,054
- What? In what package?

788
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:42,751
In what package?

789
01:06:42,943 --> 01:06:44,863
What are you blabbering?!

790
01:06:45,362 --> 01:06:47,484
Are you completely nuts?

791
01:06:47,676 --> 01:06:49,212
Got so clever, huh?

792
01:06:49,404 --> 01:06:50,566
Don't shake your head to me!

793
01:06:50,758 --> 01:06:53,282
You're talking to you mother, by the way!
Have respect!

794
01:06:53,474 --> 01:06:55,510
And if you don't like something -
be off!

795
01:06:55,702 --> 01:06:57,727
I didn't invite you here.

796
01:06:58,111 --> 01:06:59,618
Look at her...

797
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:01,222
Why did I even give birth?.

798
01:07:01,414 --> 01:07:03,468
Just look at yourself: how do you look right now?

799
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:05,599
- How?
- Like a wh*re!

800
01:07:05,791 --> 01:07:08,786
- Mom...
- Mom what? Want a breast? Here!

801
01:07:09,084 --> 01:07:10,706
"Mommy, oh mommy"...

802
01:07:14,834 --> 01:07:17,695
Oh? Oh?

803
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:20,633
What, searched everything? Not here?

804
01:07:21,295 --> 01:07:23,522
How could you even think about this.

805
01:07:26,767 --> 01:07:28,687
No battery. Of course.

806
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:31,913
Of course there's no battery, where was it?

807
01:07:32,162 --> 01:07:33,977
- Was lying under you bed.

808
01:07:34,169 --> 01:07:35,935
- Must have fallen, then.

809
01:07:36,127 --> 01:07:37,903
Thank God, it was found.

810
01:07:38,662 --> 01:07:40,111
Well, let's have some tea, then.

811
01:07:40,303 --> 01:07:42,329
Although I don't have anything sweet,
just the honey.

812
01:07:42,521 --> 01:07:44,566
Became all hard over time...
- No thanks, mom.

813
01:07:44,758 --> 01:07:46,812
We'll go.
- Oh how polite she is, just look at her.

814
01:07:48,492 --> 01:07:51,142
You two don't even seem very upset.

815
01:07:51,334 --> 01:07:53,062
"Alyosha is missing!"

816
01:07:53,532 --> 01:07:55,270
You're lying, aren't you?

817
01:07:55,462 --> 01:07:57,017
To make me sympathize?

818
01:07:57,209 --> 01:07:59,033
You chose the wrong person.

819
01:07:59,225 --> 01:08:01,049
I see right through you.

820
01:08:02,258 --> 01:08:03,890
You said you're divorcing.

821
01:08:04,082 --> 01:08:06,742
Decided to hand you b*stard to me?

822
01:08:06,934 --> 01:08:08,470
Seen this?

823
01:08:08,662 --> 01:08:11,426
I told you back them and am telling right now:
I won't babysit him!

824
01:08:11,618 --> 01:08:12,626
- Do you even talk to anyone except the TV?

825
01:08:12,818 --> 01:08:15,516
- And when you were big-bellied,
do you remember what I was telling you?

826
01:08:15,698 --> 01:08:17,206
"Change you mind, dear, change your mind!"

827
01:08:17,398 --> 01:08:20,095
And what did you tell me to do, remember?
Well, I remember.

828
01:08:20,287 --> 01:08:22,457
I told you you will come crawling to me

829
01:08:22,649 --> 01:08:24,828
but it will be too late. And here you go.

830
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:26,556
Now it's your problem.

831
01:08:26,748 --> 01:08:29,791
A good lesson for you.
- Mom, what are you talking?

832
01:08:30,070 --> 01:08:32,057
Have shame, there's a stranger in the room...

833
01:08:32,249 --> 01:08:34,054
- Don't teach me. Why did you start teaching me?

834
01:08:34,246 --> 01:08:36,876
Why should I be ashamed?
I'm in my house, by the way.

835
01:08:37,068 --> 01:08:39,526
Look at them! Trying to make a fool of me!

836
01:08:39,718 --> 01:08:41,446
Brought their asses in the middle of the night,

837
01:08:41,638 --> 01:08:45,046
just like thieves,
brought some valuator with them -

838
01:08:45,948 --> 01:08:47,878
and I won't leave my house to you!

839
01:08:48,070 --> 01:08:50,354
Do you hear me? Don't even think about it!

840
01:08:50,546 --> 01:08:52,831
I'll give everything to God! That's it!

841
01:08:53,023 --> 01:08:54,089
I have nothing to offer to eat,

842
01:08:54,281 --> 01:08:56,038
all I have is a pension...
- Okay, let's go.

843
01:08:56,230 --> 01:08:57,766
- ...you don't even care about me...

844
01:08:57,958 --> 01:08:59,839
- Okay, mom, we'll go.
- ...and I don't need your care!

845
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:01,049
- Let's go...
- Oh dear Lord...

846
01:09:01,241 --> 01:09:03,564
Won't even come to my funerals...
- We'll come, worry not.

847
01:09:03,756 --> 01:09:04,610
F*ck you!

848
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:37,250
- Where are we? Is there much left?

849
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:39,593
- Around 40 minutes, I think.

850
01:09:45,353 --> 01:09:47,273
Her paranoia is only progressing with time...

851
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:50,585
So much hate... It's crazy.

852
01:09:50,777 --> 01:09:52,572
- You think you're full of love?

853
01:09:53,263 --> 01:09:54,838
- Why do you defend her?

854
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:57,362
- Cause she's right.
- In what?

855
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:00,031
In saying that you can't wait till she dies?

856
01:10:00,223 --> 01:10:01,951
- Watch your tongue.

857
01:10:05,791 --> 01:10:08,086
She's right in saying
that I shouldn't get involved with you,

858
01:10:08,278 --> 01:10:10,265
shouldn't give birth, shouldn't be so foolish.

859
01:10:11,071 --> 01:10:13,865
But I listened to you.

860
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:18,022
"Everything's fine, we're together"
Explain to me now,

861
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:21,238
how did it happen that you were promising love

862
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:22,966
and happiness,

863
01:10:23,158 --> 01:10:25,798
and as a result I've had
only pain and disappointment.

864
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:29,926
Impenetrable ass full of shit.

865
01:10:41,993 --> 01:10:44,566
I never even loved you.

866
01:10:47,657 --> 01:10:49,817
I just couldn't live with her any longer.

867
01:10:54,626 --> 01:10:56,748
And couldn't get unstuck from her either.

868
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:00,607
I could with you.

869
01:11:02,854 --> 01:11:04,774
I used you.

870
01:11:05,484 --> 01:11:06,991
As I thought.

871
01:11:07,183 --> 01:11:09,046
In reality, you used me.

872
01:11:09,238 --> 01:11:10,918
You needed a family, not I.

873
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:13,423
I could have managed without it, really.

874
01:11:18,204 --> 01:11:20,825
I just should have start
to live on my own somewhere.

875
01:11:23,916 --> 01:11:26,086
But I got pregnant.

876
01:11:28,006 --> 01:11:29,926
That's when I got depressed.

877
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:35,359
I shouldn't have listened to you,
should have made an abortion.

878
01:11:35,551 --> 01:11:36,031
- Yeah, you should have.

879
01:11:36,223 --> 01:11:38,422
It would have been better for all of us.

880
01:11:38,614 --> 01:11:40,812
- Oh really? And what would have changed?

881
01:11:41,004 --> 01:11:42,540
Would you have changed?

882
01:11:42,732 --> 01:11:45,919
Haven't you made big-bellied another young fool,
with pulling her into your hell?

883
01:11:46,841 --> 01:11:48,386
In 10-12 years, if you still get a boner,

884
01:11:48,578 --> 01:11:50,882
you'll perform this trick once more, I'm sure.

885
01:11:53,206 --> 01:11:55,586
Poor girl, I even pity her.

886
01:12:00,156 --> 01:12:02,422
You ruined my life, do you get this?

887
01:12:07,769 --> 01:12:09,554
Thank God, I met a decent man,

888
01:12:09,746 --> 01:12:11,532
who doesn't need anything from me,

889
01:12:11,724 --> 01:12:13,452
except for me myself.

890
01:12:15,593 --> 01:12:18,156
What happened? We broke down?
- Yeah, we broke down.

891
01:12:18,348 --> 01:12:19,942
- Get out.
- No, seriously.

892
01:12:20,134 --> 01:12:21,727
- I'm serious. Get the f*ck out!

893
01:12:23,647 --> 01:12:25,961
Get out while I didn't kick you out with my legs.

894
01:12:26,153 --> 01:12:28,466
- Go on, what else haven't you done with me, ***!

895
01:12:29,225 --> 01:12:32,095
Don't forget that your son got missing, jerk!

896
01:14:52,601 --> 01:14:54,166
- Let's keep the line!

897
01:14:55,481 --> 01:14:56,844
Stay close!

898
01:15:03,602 --> 01:15:05,522
- Fox 1, doing the calling.

899
01:15:07,596 --> 01:15:14,518
Aaa-lyooo-shaaa!

900
01:15:19,346 --> 01:15:26,047
Aaa-lyooo-shaaa!

901
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:36,012
Aaa-lyooo-shaaa!

902
01:15:43,692 --> 01:15:45,612
Fox 1, the calling finished.

903
01:15:45,804 --> 01:15:47,532
Let's go, guys.

904
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:40,351
- This is it.

905
01:16:40,850 --> 01:16:42,770
- Can you do it one more time?

906
01:16:45,775 --> 01:16:47,705
- He's not there on the other cameras.

907
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:50,306
Neither on the way to school, not to the mall,

908
01:16:50,335 --> 01:16:52,121
to which they all go
as if there's a magnet there.

909
01:16:52,313 --> 01:16:53,887
- Well, there's food and it looks nice.

910
01:16:54,079 --> 01:16:56,566
- not on the way to the bus or the route-taxi.

911
01:16:56,758 --> 01:17:00,962
If he wanted to go towards the metro
and then to the train station, for example,

912
01:17:01,154 --> 01:17:02,882
the options are:

913
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:06,578
either he turned
where there are no street cameras -

914
01:17:06,770 --> 01:17:08,306
and there are a lot of such places -

915
01:17:08,498 --> 01:17:11,350
or he chose to walk so that he avoids them,

916
01:17:11,542 --> 01:17:13,270
which is unlikely.

917
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:15,190
Or he was taken.

918
01:17:15,526 --> 01:17:17,167
- What do you mean, taken?

919
01:17:18,127 --> 01:17:19,711
- Kidnapped.

920
01:17:21,622 --> 01:17:23,542
- Are you serious?.

921
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:26,210
- You don't joke about such things.

922
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:29,858
- It is impossible.

923
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:32,652
- Unfortunately, sometimes it is.
And what do you have?

924
01:17:34,418 --> 01:17:36,905
- Yesterday's survey was useless.

925
01:17:37,097 --> 01:17:39,209
It took a long time, according to us.

926
01:17:39,401 --> 01:17:41,503
You should initiate a investigating case.

927
01:17:41,935 --> 01:17:44,623
Maybe even a criminal one.
- Excuse me.

928
01:17:45,132 --> 01:17:48,636
- We handed out the posters,
to emergencies and shops,

929
01:17:48,751 --> 01:17:50,940
to the kiosks...
- Hello?

930
01:17:51,036 --> 01:17:52,649
- Darling, I missed you.

931
01:17:52,841 --> 01:17:54,569
Will you come tonight? You promised.

932
01:17:54,761 --> 01:17:56,902
- I don't think so, I must take part in the search.

933
01:17:57,094 --> 01:17:57,919
- And what about me?

934
01:17:58,111 --> 01:18:00,386
What about your work? You said it's so strict there...

935
01:18:00,444 --> 01:18:01,951
- I took a day off.

936
01:18:03,161 --> 01:18:05,081
- And a day off of me, too?

937
01:18:05,273 --> 01:18:07,001
- Don't be ridiculous.

938
01:18:07,942 --> 01:18:09,948
You perfectly understand everything.

939
01:18:10,774 --> 01:18:12,425
- I just feel so lonely.

940
01:18:12,617 --> 01:18:14,076
You're there, I'm here...

941
01:18:14,268 --> 01:18:15,833
It won't be always like this, will it?

942
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:16,994
- Sure it won't.

943
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:19,279
Okay, goodbye, I really have to go.

944
01:18:19,471 --> 01:18:20,556
- No, wait, wait!

945
01:18:20,748 --> 01:18:23,436
Don't hang up, I want to listen
to what you're doing there.

946
01:18:24,098 --> 01:18:26,508
- What are you talking about?

947
01:18:27,401 --> 01:18:29,071
It's not appropriate.

948
01:18:29,657 --> 01:18:30,991
- Why?

949
01:18:31,855 --> 01:18:33,593
Are you hiding something?

950
01:18:33,766 --> 01:18:35,801
- Of course, not.

951
01:18:37,721 --> 01:18:39,679
- You're definitely hiding something.

952
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:41,186
Is your ex also there?

953
01:18:42,338 --> 01:18:42,914
- Masha,

954
01:18:43,106 --> 01:18:45,026
don't be silly.

955
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:47,830
I love you.

956
01:18:48,502 --> 01:18:49,692
- Really?

957
01:18:49,884 --> 01:18:51,074
- Of course.

958
01:18:51,862 --> 01:18:53,417
- I love you, too.

959
01:18:53,609 --> 01:18:55,980
We love you.
- Okay, bye.

960
01:18:56,076 --> 01:18:59,148
- Bye. Kiss you and I'm waiting for you!

961
01:19:00,329 --> 01:19:04,649
- Oh, oh, how gentle she is, like a kitty!.
- Mom...

962
01:19:05,052 --> 01:19:07,529
Let me do things myself, okay?

963
01:19:07,721 --> 01:19:10,274
- Sure, for God's sake!

964
01:19:10,908 --> 01:19:12,454
Of course, you do it yourself.

965
01:19:13,366 --> 01:19:16,562
It's just that my mother taught me
and I taught you:

966
01:19:17,023 --> 01:19:19,126
Those men, Masha, you know,

967
01:19:19,318 --> 01:19:20,834
are like babies.

968
01:19:22,783 --> 01:19:25,913
You're such a beauty, my dear!

969
01:19:28,006 --> 01:19:31,260
Check this one, I showed you as you walked by,
you didn't even notice.

970
01:19:31,452 --> 01:19:32,162
- Mm, no...

971
01:19:32,489 --> 01:19:33,756
- Hi, dad.

972
01:19:34,044 --> 01:19:35,964
- Hello, my dear.

973
01:19:37,327 --> 01:19:40,006
- So, how are you?

974
01:19:40,198 --> 01:19:41,340
- Fine.

975
01:19:41,926 --> 01:19:43,846
Autumn.

976
01:19:44,393 --> 01:19:46,745
- And we're having summer,
by the way, all the year.

977
01:19:47,417 --> 01:19:49,241
- Are you coming to Moscow some time?

978
01:19:49,433 --> 01:19:51,641
- What will I do there?

979
01:19:52,879 --> 01:19:55,116
- Well, to see me.

980
01:19:55,308 --> 01:19:57,554
- I see you right now.

981
01:19:59,292 --> 01:20:00,924
Obrigado.

982
01:20:05,676 --> 01:20:07,154
Okay, dad,

983
01:20:07,788 --> 01:20:10,774
I have to go, I have a meeting, I told you.

984
01:20:11,378 --> 01:20:14,095
Don't feel sad without me, please!

985
01:20:14,431 --> 01:20:17,436
I kiss you so so so much!

986
01:20:17,628 --> 01:20:20,383
- Okay, bye, I kiss you.

987
01:20:20,575 --> 01:20:23,321
- Kiss you! Bye bye bye!

988
01:21:15,852 --> 01:21:17,474
- Get up.

989
01:21:18,108 --> 01:21:19,711
It's time to go.

990
01:21:26,614 --> 01:21:28,188
- What's the time?

991
01:21:32,028 --> 01:21:34,505
- Look, I'll go with you, if it's okay.

992
01:21:35,071 --> 01:21:36,233
- Yeah, sure.

993
01:21:36,425 --> 01:21:39,113
Don't you need to go to work?
- The work will wait.

994
01:21:39,554 --> 01:21:40,236
- Right.

995
01:21:42,156 --> 01:21:44,076
I need to call that, what's his name,

996
01:21:44,575 --> 01:21:45,958
the coordinator.

997
01:21:46,150 --> 01:21:48,569
God, how late it is. I did set the alarm clock...

998
01:21:48,761 --> 01:21:50,268
- I switched it off,

999
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:51,977
you had to rest.

1000
01:22:00,204 --> 01:22:01,250
- Listening.

1001
01:22:01,442 --> 01:22:03,170
- Hello, Ivan?
- Yes.

1002
01:22:03,362 --> 01:22:05,282
- Hello, this is Alyosha Sleptsov's mother.

1003
01:22:05,474 --> 01:22:07,010
- Yeah, do you have some news?

1004
01:22:07,202 --> 01:22:10,572
- No, do you?
- Haven't found yet, we keep working.

1005
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:14,191
- Okay.
- Something else?

1006
01:22:15,727 --> 01:22:17,868
- You see, I came back very late yesterday,

1007
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:20,748
so I couldn't...
- I'm sorry, I have absolutely no time right now,

1008
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:22,668
I'm sorry.

1009
01:22:22,870 --> 01:22:24,502
- Yes, yes, I understand, just tell me

1010
01:22:24,694 --> 01:22:25,788
what I can do.

1011
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:27,708
I cannot just sit here and wait
- Take the phone

1012
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:31,452
and start calling all the hospitals in the district,
without exceptions.

1013
01:22:31,644 --> 01:22:33,170
Any unidentified boy aged 10-13,

1014
01:22:33,362 --> 01:22:34,706
brought by the police or ambulance,

1015
01:22:34,898 --> 01:22:37,951
no matter if he fits the description,
is our case

1016
01:22:38,143 --> 01:22:39,871
and must be visually checked.

1017
01:22:40,274 --> 01:22:43,068
If you find one,
inform me immediately,

1018
01:22:43,308 --> 01:22:46,006
preferably by SMS. I'll send a group there.

1019
01:22:46,361 --> 01:22:48,098
- We can go there ourselves, we have a car.

1020
01:22:48,146 --> 01:22:49,394
- Great. But inform me nevertheless.

1021
01:22:49,586 --> 01:22:53,330
In any case, there will be and experienced searcher
who knows how to behave in this situation.

1022
01:22:53,954 --> 01:22:56,614
If there are multiple cases,
it's better is there are

1023
01:22:56,806 --> 01:23:00,482
more that one group.
That's it, I cannot talk anymore, we'll be in touch.

1024
01:23:19,164 --> 01:23:20,642
When did you see him last?

1025
01:23:20,786 --> 01:23:22,966
- Well, two days before yesterday, I think.

1026
01:23:23,542 --> 01:23:25,020
- On the 9th?

1027
01:23:25,212 --> 01:23:26,815
On Tuesday?

1028
01:23:27,007 --> 01:23:28,601
- Yeah.
- Where?

1029
01:23:29,129 --> 01:23:30,607
- Here, at school.

1030
01:23:32,316 --> 01:23:34,361
- And what did you do after school?

1031
01:23:35,119 --> 01:23:37,126
- Nothing, we went home.

1032
01:23:39,286 --> 01:23:41,138
- And where do you hang out usually?

1033
01:23:41,782 --> 01:23:43,366
- In the courtyard, I don't know.

1034
01:23:43,558 --> 01:23:45,478
- Okay, in the courtyard, and where else?

1035
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:47,887
- Nowhere.

1036
01:23:47,926 --> 01:23:49,481
- Oh come on.

1037
01:23:49,673 --> 01:23:51,593
In the mall, probably?

1038
01:23:51,986 --> 01:23:54,338
- No, our parents don't let us go there.

1039
01:23:54,425 --> 01:23:57,698
- Are you some babies? Do you stay in the courtyard?
Playing in a sand-box, or something?

1040
01:23:57,967 --> 01:24:01,212
- Why babies? We play football
on a hockey playground.

1041
01:24:03,554 --> 01:24:05,378
- And do you have a bike?

1042
01:24:05,570 --> 01:24:07,298
- Yes.

1043
01:24:07,769 --> 01:24:10,399
- So, where do you usually go to with Alyosha?

1044
01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:12,012
- Well, nowhere.

1045
01:24:12,204 --> 01:24:14,124
In the block, around the buildings.

1046
01:24:14,316 --> 01:24:15,554
- Look, young man.

1047
01:24:15,746 --> 01:24:18,540
If you know where he is
but you're not telling because he asked you -

1048
01:24:18,732 --> 01:24:20,268
fine, don't tell.

1049
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:22,188
I understand it, really.

1050
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:25,874
The main thing is that you are sure
that you friend is safe, alive and well.

1051
01:24:25,970 --> 01:24:29,628
We are the grown-ups,
we'll run, we'll search, it's not a problem.

1052
01:24:29,935 --> 01:24:32,297
Just like the hide-and-seek, right?

1053
01:24:32,652 --> 01:24:34,255
Do you play a game with us?

1054
01:24:34,447 --> 01:24:36,367
- I really don't know where he is.

1055
01:24:39,814 --> 01:24:41,666
- Okay, I believe you.

1056
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:44,911
And where can he be?

1057
01:24:45,938 --> 01:24:48,444
I know, you have a camp.

1058
01:24:49,596 --> 01:24:52,246
To be honest, I don't know where it is,
but I really know that it exists.

1059
01:24:52,284 --> 01:24:54,492
You chatted about it on VKontakte.

1060
01:24:55,298 --> 01:24:58,937
If you really don't know where Alyosha is,
but you assume he could be there,

1061
01:24:59,129 --> 01:25:01,990
you have to tell us where this place is.

1062
01:25:02,806 --> 01:25:05,897
Because you friend might be in danger now.

1063
01:25:11,196 --> 01:25:13,961
Look, bro, we'll find him anyway.

1064
01:25:14,633 --> 01:25:16,946
But it can be too late, and it will be sad.

1065
01:25:17,782 --> 01:25:20,402
What's more important for you,
a friend or some place?

1066
01:25:20,450 --> 01:25:22,802
You'll find plenty of other places like that!

1067
01:25:22,994 --> 01:25:23,628
And if you gave some oath,

1068
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:25,385
believe me, you aren't breaking it now,

1069
01:25:25,577 --> 01:25:26,978
because you're saving your friend,

1070
01:25:27,170 --> 01:25:28,582
and he really needs your help.

1071
01:25:30,502 --> 01:25:32,422
- It's in the forest,

1072
01:25:32,614 --> 01:25:33,295
the camp.

1073
01:25:33,602 --> 01:25:34,889
- Okay, good.

1074
01:25:35,081 --> 01:25:37,135
What is it? A dugout? A hut?

1075
01:25:37,327 --> 01:25:39,391
- No, it's an abandoned building.

1076
01:25:39,583 --> 01:25:41,119
It's in the basement.

1077
01:25:41,311 --> 01:25:43,222
- Is it better to go there on foot or by bike?

1078
01:25:44,220 --> 01:25:46,850
- It quite far, better by bike.

1079
01:25:47,042 --> 01:25:48,367
- Will you show?

1080
01:25:52,207 --> 01:25:54,310
You helped us a lot, thank you.

1081
01:25:55,010 --> 01:25:57,372
The boy of yours is a fine fellow.

1082
01:25:57,804 --> 01:25:59,753
Tell me, do you have some more time?

1083
01:25:59,945 --> 01:26:00,540
- Yes, I do.

1084
01:26:00,732 --> 01:26:03,180
- Good. Will you go with us?
Would you help?

1085
01:26:03,372 --> 01:26:04,265
- Okay.

1086
01:26:04,457 --> 01:26:06,377
- Thank you, good bye!
- Good bye!

1087
01:26:31,788 --> 01:26:32,873
- So? Shall we go?

1088
01:26:33,065 --> 01:26:34,150
- Yeah, let's go.

1089
01:26:36,070 --> 01:26:37,030
One moment.

1090
01:28:10,150 --> 01:28:11,282
- It's there.

1091
01:28:47,628 --> 01:28:49,174
- That's his jacket.

1092
01:28:55,433 --> 01:28:56,834
- Grandpa Pihto to Ivan, over.

1093
01:28:57,026 --> 01:28:59,906
We found a jacket, the father is sure it's his.
How copy?

1094
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:01,423
- Acknowledged.

1095
01:29:01,615 --> 01:29:04,534
In this case we search
all the complex of buildings and surroundings.

1096
01:29:04,889 --> 01:29:05,484
I remind:

1097
01:29:05,676 --> 01:29:07,711
Mark dangerous, strange places

1098
01:29:07,903 --> 01:29:10,822
inform about them but don't go inside.

1099
01:29:11,014 --> 01:29:12,742
There are professionals for that.

1100
01:29:13,001 --> 01:29:14,873
Don't increase the suffering, don't get hurt.

1101
01:29:15,065 --> 01:29:18,271
If something like this happens
we stop the search

1102
01:29:18,463 --> 01:29:21,660
and focus our efforts
on helping the partner.

1103
01:29:21,775 --> 01:29:24,425
First, contact the coordinator,
that is, me.

1104
01:29:24,617 --> 01:29:28,006
Medical assistance is provided
by the doctor only. He's there.

1105
01:29:28,198 --> 01:29:29,734
Until he comes,

1106
01:29:29,926 --> 01:29:32,335
the "runner", in case he's physically restrained,

1107
01:29:32,527 --> 01:29:34,255
stays untouched, we talk to him,

1108
01:29:34,447 --> 01:29:35,753
we comfort him verbally,

1109
01:29:35,945 --> 01:29:37,250
wait for the doctor.

1110
01:29:37,567 --> 01:29:38,902
Okay, let's race.

1111
01:29:39,094 --> 01:29:41,542
The race is a metaphor, don't take it literally.

1112
01:29:41,734 --> 01:29:43,462
Okay, let's go!

1113
01:30:44,316 --> 01:30:45,564
- Dawn to Ivan.

1114
01:30:45,756 --> 01:30:48,530
First floor and basement checked.

1115
01:30:48,722 --> 01:30:51,218
What are the further actions? How copy?

1116
01:30:52,399 --> 01:30:53,686
- Acknowledged, Dawn. Roger that.

1117
01:30:53,878 --> 01:30:56,038
You can help Fox 1 in the neighbour building.

1118
01:30:56,230 --> 01:30:56,969
Over.

1119
01:30:57,372 --> 01:30:59,292
- Acknowledged. Roger.

1120
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:11,388
- Granpda Pihto to Ivan.

1121
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:14,527
Roof and all rooms of the 2nd floor examined.

1122
01:32:14,777 --> 01:32:15,794
No traces.

1123
01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:17,906
How copy? Over.

1124
01:32:18,617 --> 01:32:20,316
- Acknowledged. Message for everybody.

1125
01:32:20,508 --> 01:32:22,006
Object closed, the both buildings.

1126
01:32:22,198 --> 01:32:24,722
The boy's not found, we search the forest next.

1127
01:32:53,522 --> 01:32:54,924
- Hello.
- Hello.

1128
01:32:55,116 --> 01:32:56,383
- We need you help.
- Listening.

1129
01:32:56,537 --> 01:32:58,937
- We're from the search-and-rescue squad,
we're looking for a boy,

1130
01:32:59,129 --> 01:33:01,087
Alyosha Sleptsov, 12 years old, this is his mother.

1131
01:33:01,279 --> 01:33:03,958
He ran away and could have called himself
by different name.

1132
01:33:04,150 --> 01:33:06,828
We know that you received a boy
who fits the description.

1133
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:08,287
Can we see him?

1134
01:33:09,439 --> 01:33:11,542
- You two, take a seat here, please.

1135
01:33:11,734 --> 01:33:12,905
And you go with me.

1136
01:33:13,826 --> 01:33:14,854
- Is he okay?

1137
01:33:15,046 --> 01:33:17,522
- He's fine, just tired and scared.

1138
01:33:17,714 --> 01:33:18,079
- Scared by what?

1139
01:33:18,271 --> 01:33:20,671
- Well, the police picked him up in the street
yesterday at night.

1140
01:33:20,863 --> 01:33:23,426
They kept him till the morning somewhere,
then brought here.

1141
01:33:23,618 --> 01:33:26,182
- How could they do that? They know about him,
I filed a report.

1142
01:33:26,374 --> 01:33:27,516
- They know nothing.

1143
01:33:27,708 --> 01:33:29,628
Another shift came, that's it.

1144
01:33:29,820 --> 01:33:31,548
Some strange kid,

1145
01:33:31,913 --> 01:33:33,948
who says nothing. They took him to the hospital.

1146
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:35,868
A usual procedure.

1147
01:33:38,460 --> 01:33:39,814
Come in.

1148
01:33:41,494 --> 01:33:44,076
Hey... Wake up.

1149
01:34:20,998 --> 01:34:22,850
- Don't rush!

1150
01:34:23,042 --> 01:34:24,578
Keep up!

1151
01:34:24,770 --> 01:34:26,690
Maintain the visual contact.

1152
01:34:27,286 --> 01:34:29,263
Keep together.

1153
01:34:58,745 --> 01:35:00,665
- No, we didn't see him here.

1154
01:35:00,934 --> 01:35:04,054
You cannot get to the territory
without a pass or a special permit.

1155
01:35:04,246 --> 01:35:04,918
It's a secure area.

1156
01:35:04,975 --> 01:35:06,588
- May I leave the posters?

1157
01:35:06,780 --> 01:35:08,690
Maybe the other shift saw him?

1158
01:35:08,882 --> 01:35:10,793
- No problem.
- Thanks a lot.

1159
01:35:11,359 --> 01:35:12,434
- Thank you!

1160
01:35:24,050 --> 01:35:26,297
- Fox 1, doing the calling.

1161
01:35:28,630 --> 01:35:33,823
Aaa-lyooo-shaaa!

1162
01:35:41,858 --> 01:35:47,551
Aaa-lyooo-shaaa!

1163
01:35:53,695 --> 01:35:59,820
Aaa-lyooo-shaaa!

1164
01:36:07,212 --> 01:36:08,882
- Grandpa Pihto to Ivan.

1165
01:36:09,132 --> 01:36:11,081
Came to the river. No traces.

1166
01:36:11,273 --> 01:36:12,108
How copy?

1167
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:14,345
- Acknowledged. Come back.

1168
01:36:14,537 --> 01:36:17,359
- Roger.
- What about in the river?

1169
01:36:17,858 --> 01:36:19,087
- We don't look for the dead.

1170
01:36:19,279 --> 01:36:22,082
It's done by the police or the Extreme Measures,
if there are reasons.

1171
01:36:22,274 --> 01:36:24,358
Crew! Go back!

1172
01:36:24,550 --> 01:36:26,470
Return to the base.

1173
01:36:27,151 --> 01:36:28,860
- Fox 1, we're going back.

1174
01:36:34,524 --> 01:36:36,674
- With regard to the absence of a positive result

1175
01:36:36,809 --> 01:36:39,497
in the search of a "runner" and
a sharp worsening of weather conditions

1176
01:36:39,689 --> 01:36:43,126
I make a decision
to change the status of the search.

1177
01:36:43,318 --> 01:36:45,391
We start an intense informing of the public

1178
01:36:45,583 --> 01:36:47,119
about a child gone missing.

1179
01:36:47,311 --> 01:36:50,498
We start the total poster put-up:

1180
01:36:50,690 --> 01:36:53,878
bus stops, underground crossings,

1181
01:36:54,070 --> 01:36:56,018
doorways, light poles,

1182
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:58,495
benches, information boards,

1183
01:36:58,687 --> 01:37:02,498
fences, shops if there's permission
of the administrator.

1184
01:37:02,690 --> 01:37:03,871
As usually.

1185
01:37:04,418 --> 01:37:06,742
Now, I need 2 groups of 5 people

1186
01:37:06,934 --> 01:37:08,662
to check the doorways.

1187
01:37:10,034 --> 01:37:11,743
Great, we'll sort it out.

1188
01:37:11,935 --> 01:37:13,644
The others get on the put-up.

1189
01:37:13,817 --> 01:37:14,873
Okay, let's go!

1190
01:37:15,334 --> 01:37:17,254
- The descriptions are here.

1191
01:37:19,462 --> 01:37:20,134
- Thanks.

1192
01:37:44,402 --> 01:37:48,626
- Dawn to Ivan. The elevator stopped
at the 3rd floor. How copy?

1193
01:37:48,962 --> 01:37:51,151
- Acknowledged. We wait.

1194
01:37:55,241 --> 01:37:57,113
- It's going down.

1195
01:38:17,436 --> 01:38:18,962
- Oh. Good evening.
- Howdy...

1196
01:38:21,535 --> 01:38:23,599
- Dawn to Ivan. It's not him.

1197
01:38:24,022 --> 01:38:26,882
- Acknowledged. Keep the surveillance.

1198
01:38:29,138 --> 01:38:31,020
- Young man...
- Let's go...

1199
01:38:31,212 --> 01:38:34,706
- ...are you?
- Excuse us, please...

1200
01:38:35,474 --> 01:38:36,742
You silly.

1201
01:38:40,447 --> 01:38:42,214
- I almost fixed your love life...

1202
01:38:42,348 --> 01:38:43,558
- Yeah, right.

1203
01:38:43,788 --> 01:38:45,190
- Wow, the "green fellows"...

1204
01:38:45,958 --> 01:38:48,377
From what planet are you, boys?.

1205
01:38:48,569 --> 01:38:49,990
- Young lady, please, go.

1206
01:38:51,122 --> 01:38:52,582
- How polite!

1207
01:45:48,809 --> 01:45:50,326
- Wait here.

1208
01:45:58,582 --> 01:46:00,022
Hello!

1209
01:46:00,866 --> 01:46:02,786
Here we are.

1210
01:46:27,142 --> 01:46:28,620
Anton, can you...

1211
01:46:44,566 --> 01:46:45,641
It'll be hard.

1212
01:46:49,308 --> 01:46:50,729
- I am ready.

1213
01:47:19,222 --> 01:47:20,921
It's not him...

1214
01:47:23,945 --> 01:47:26,172
Alyosha had a birthmark here, on the chest...

1215
01:47:26,364 --> 01:47:27,804
A birthmark, on a chest...

1216
01:47:30,607 --> 01:47:31,990
Not him...

1217
01:47:32,748 --> 01:47:34,668
- Are you sure?.

1218
01:47:35,926 --> 01:47:37,999
No, no, it's not him...

1219
01:47:40,255 --> 01:47:42,636
These hands and fingers...

1220
01:47:42,828 --> 01:47:45,458
Hair, everything... No, it's not him...

1221
01:47:51,938 --> 01:47:54,463
Please, take him away...

1222
01:47:55,606 --> 01:47:57,612
Please, take away...

1223
01:48:04,735 --> 01:48:06,214
- In fact, we should perform

1224
01:48:06,406 --> 01:48:08,930
a comparative DNA analysis
so that we're sure that...

1225
01:48:09,122 --> 01:48:10,658
- It's not him, isn't it clear?

1226
01:48:10,850 --> 01:48:13,625
- You know, sometimes people
just refuse to believe that...

1227
01:48:13,817 --> 01:48:15,199
- It's not him, how many times
must I repeat?

1228
01:48:15,391 --> 01:48:17,119
- Listen to me,

1229
01:48:17,215 --> 01:48:19,193
this analysis can be done only by you.

1230
01:48:19,385 --> 01:48:21,391
The cops haven't initiated a case yet,
they'll drag it...

1231
01:48:21,583 --> 01:48:25,010
- God, you must be kidding me You don't here me?
It's not him, how many times must I repeat?

1232
01:48:25,135 --> 01:48:27,468
I'm talking to you in plain Russian - it's not him!

1233
01:48:27,660 --> 01:48:29,254
- Zhenya...
- It's not him!

1234
01:48:29,407 --> 01:48:31,020
