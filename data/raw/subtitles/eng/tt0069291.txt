1
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:37,725
Good morning, Baxter.
Nice of you to join us.

2
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:40,566
- Office hours start at 9:00, you know.
- I know, Mr. Carruthers.

3
00:00:40,646 --> 00:00:43,845
- I missed my bus, and then the taxi...
- We would appreciate it...

4
00:00:43,925 --> 00:00:46,887
if you would take care of your
personal affairs on your own time.

5
00:00:46,967 --> 00:00:48,885
What?

6
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,725
- Morning.
- Mr. Baxter.

7
00:00:57,805 --> 00:01:00,686
- Yes.
- John Sylvester Baxter?

8
00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:04,566
- Yes.
- My name is Fowler.

9
00:01:04,646 --> 00:01:08,526
I'm with the legal firm of Voorhees,
Buckner and Voorhees.

10
00:01:08,606 --> 00:01:11,286
Look, if it's about that overdue bill
at La France Dry Cleaners...

11
00:01:11,366 --> 00:01:13,287
Would you mind telling me
your mother's maiden name?

12
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:16,406
Judith Pelton. I can explain that.
You see, I didn't pay...

13
00:01:16,486 --> 00:01:19,526
I'm afraid I have
some bad news for you.

14
00:01:19,606 --> 00:01:21,527
You're not gonna sue.
The bill is not that much...

15
00:01:21,607 --> 00:01:25,046
- Jacob Barnsworth died.
- I'm sorry to hear that, but...

16
00:01:26,246 --> 00:01:29,447
- Who?
- Jacob Nash Barnsworth...

17
00:01:29,527 --> 00:01:31,887
your great uncle
on your mother's side.

18
00:01:33,407 --> 00:01:36,007
- Oh. Oh, yeah.
- As far as we can determine...

19
00:01:36,127 --> 00:01:39,528
you're the next of kin and
therefore heir to the estate.

20
00:01:41,047 --> 00:01:43,687
I'm the heir to the...
to the Jacob, uh, Nash...

21
00:01:45,086 --> 00:01:49,087
Uncle Jacob.
Oh, well, uh...

22
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:51,207
exactly what did I, uh...

23
00:01:51,287 --> 00:01:54,208
The principal asset is
the Grand Imperial Hotel.

24
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:58,368
Grand Imperial... Hotel?

25
00:01:58,488 --> 00:02:00,488
It's in Silver Hill, Colorado.

26
00:02:00,568 --> 00:02:02,649
It's small, just 25 rooms...

27
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:04,649
but it must be a sound operation.

28
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:07,008
There's a letter here
to Voorhees Senior...

29
00:02:07,088 --> 00:02:09,648
he handled all of
Mr. Barnsworth's affairs...

30
00:02:09,728 --> 00:02:14,208
mentioning that the hotel has been
taking in over $14,000 a month.

31
00:02:17,528 --> 00:02:19,648
Fourt... Every month?

32
00:02:19,728 --> 00:02:22,649
Mm-hmm. If you like, Mr. Baxter...

33
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:25,488
our office can handle the transfer
of title, recording the deed...

34
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:28,329
and, uh... Mr. Baxter?

35
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:30,369
Huh?

36
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:34,449
Oh! Oh!
Uh, please, would you for me...

37
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:38,610
Let me get something straight. You have
just told me that I am the, the owner...

38
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,289
of the Grand Imperial Hotel in, in, uh...

39
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,809
- Silver Hill, Colorado.
- Silver Hill, Colorado?

40
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:46,529
Lock, stock and bar.

41
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:50,329
Oh, the keys.

42
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:53,130
And here's a letter from
a Mr. Ridgeway up there...

43
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,930
expressing interest in the property,
if you decide you want to sell out.

44
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,850
Sell out?
No, I d-don't...

45
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,490
You said 14,000 a month.

46
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:07,209
Mm-hmm. We'll start the legal machinery
going and keep in touch.

47
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:09,210
Good-bye, Mr. Baxter.

48
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,410
- And congratulations.
- Yes, congratulations.

49
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:43,932
Everybody.

50
00:03:48,652 --> 00:03:51,292
Friends and fellow workers,
it is with mixed emotions...

51
00:03:51,372 --> 00:03:55,211
that I tell you I am leaving
Indemnity and Casualty.

52
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:57,291
After 11 years,
however, I couldn't go...

53
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:01,093
without telling you it's been
a privilege working with all of you.

54
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:04,652
There are a few, however, I'd like
to single out for special recognition.

55
00:04:04,732 --> 00:04:07,092
My personal stapler
I want to give to that man...

56
00:04:07,173 --> 00:04:10,412
who has logged more hours at
the water cooler and managed to survive:

57
00:04:10,492 --> 00:04:13,812
Jim Cullen, Mr. Water Cooler,
himself. Here you go, Jim.

58
00:04:15,012 --> 00:04:17,612
The Silver Shears Award
goes to George Moll...

59
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:20,773
because he demonstrated exceptional
courage at the Christmas party...

60
00:04:20,853 --> 00:04:23,293
when he cut off Mr. Carruthers' tie.

61
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:25,294
Keep up the good work, George.

62
00:04:25,374 --> 00:04:28,573
Beverly Bockser.
Beverly Bockser.

63
00:04:28,653 --> 00:04:32,172
The Outstanding Achievement Award,
my staple remover...

64
00:04:32,253 --> 00:04:34,213
goes to that person
who has demonstrated...

65
00:04:34,293 --> 00:04:36,733
that she can contribute
the most to office morale.

66
00:04:36,813 --> 00:04:39,893
Miss Bockser, I think I can say
without fear of contradiction...

67
00:04:39,972 --> 00:04:43,894
that you have the greatest legs in this
office, if not the whole 40th floor.

68
00:04:43,974 --> 00:04:45,894
They have been a distraction.

69
00:04:45,974 --> 00:04:48,813
They have caused
man-hours wasted, but...

70
00:04:48,893 --> 00:04:50,894
they've made life here bearable.

71
00:04:52,974 --> 00:04:55,814
- What's going on here?
- I'm giving my farewell address...

72
00:04:55,894 --> 00:04:58,174
- to the troops, Mr. Carruthers.
- You're leaving?

73
00:04:58,254 --> 00:05:00,174
Yes, Mr. Carruthers, I'm leaving.

74
00:05:00,254 --> 00:05:02,973
But I think it's only
fitting and proper...

75
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:07,494
that I return my computer cards
from whence they came.

76
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:09,494
Unfolded, unspindled...

77
00:05:09,574 --> 00:05:11,654
and unmutilated.

78
00:05:11,734 --> 00:05:15,655
Ah, ooh, eeh.
And zowie!

79
00:05:19,775 --> 00:05:21,735
Whoo!

80
00:05:37,655 --> 00:05:39,615
You quit.

81
00:05:49,177 --> 00:05:51,297
- What's the matter with her?
- You quit.

82
00:05:51,376 --> 00:05:55,215
Quit? Oh, did I quit.
It was beautiful.

83
00:05:55,295 --> 00:05:59,216
Your job. You quit your job
so we could move where?

84
00:05:59,296 --> 00:06:01,536
To Silver Hill, Colorado.

85
00:06:01,615 --> 00:06:04,376
Where's Silver Hill, Colorado?

86
00:06:04,456 --> 00:06:06,656
It's in Wyoming.

87
00:06:06,736 --> 00:06:08,736
Richard, maybe you'd
better go to your room.

88
00:06:08,816 --> 00:06:10,736
Mom, what has this
got to do with sex?

89
00:06:10,816 --> 00:06:12,937
Richard!

90
00:06:16,817 --> 00:06:20,697
Johnny, you have invested...

91
00:06:20,777 --> 00:06:23,377
11 years with that company.

92
00:06:23,457 --> 00:06:27,056
Yes, 11 years. And in that time,
I've moved up three rows...

93
00:06:27,176 --> 00:06:30,018
from Accounts Receivable
to Accounts Payable.

94
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:33,257
Honey, I feel like I've been
diggin' myself into a hole...

95
00:06:33,337 --> 00:06:35,777
and today somebody
threw me a rope.

96
00:06:35,857 --> 00:06:38,018
You're just going
to give up everything...

97
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:41,498
and drag your family off
into the wilderness?

98
00:06:41,578 --> 00:06:43,498
Wil... Wh-What...

99
00:06:43,578 --> 00:06:46,578
Honey, I am taking over
as the owner...

100
00:06:46,658 --> 00:06:49,697
and the proprietor
of the Grand Imperial Hotel.

101
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:52,817
Does that sound like a wilderness?
Susie, this is an opportunity...

102
00:06:52,897 --> 00:06:55,618
that comes to few men
in their lifetimes.

103
00:06:55,698 --> 00:06:58,258
To stand on
your own two feet, and to...

104
00:06:58,378 --> 00:07:02,538
and to discover your own individuality
in a world where we're all becoming...

105
00:07:09,058 --> 00:07:13,139
In a world where we're all becoming
holes punched in a card.

106
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,297
I wanna get out
of this smudge pot...

107
00:07:17,377 --> 00:07:19,418
get out to where the sky's blue...

108
00:07:19,498 --> 00:07:23,099
and, and the air is clear and...

109
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,659
Okay. Okay!

110
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:36,660
Run out if you want to, but this
family is moving to Silver Hill!

111
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,059
Colorado!

112
00:09:21,702 --> 00:09:25,863
- I don't see any hotel.
- Maybe we're in the wrong part of town.

113
00:09:25,943 --> 00:09:29,424
There's only one part of town,
and we're almost out of that.

114
00:09:29,504 --> 00:09:31,544
Maybe I better ask somebody.

115
00:09:52,464 --> 00:09:55,624
- Hi. You folks from New York?
- Yeah, that's right.

116
00:09:55,704 --> 00:09:58,264
Yeah, I could tell
by your license plate.

117
00:09:58,344 --> 00:10:00,624
We're looking
for the Grand Imperial Hotel.

118
00:10:00,704 --> 00:10:02,904
Huh?

119
00:10:02,984 --> 00:10:05,904
- The Grand Imperial Hotel.
- Never heard of it.

120
00:10:05,984 --> 00:10:07,985
Well, this is
Silver Hill, isn't it?

121
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:11,384
- Oh, yeah.
- And you don't know the Grand Imperial?

122
00:10:11,464 --> 00:10:14,304
- No, and I've lived here all my life.
- What's goin' on?

123
00:10:14,384 --> 00:10:17,785
Oh, Double L, these folks are lookin'
for the... What did you call it?

124
00:10:17,865 --> 00:10:20,265
- The Grand what?
- Imperial. It's a hotel.

125
00:10:20,345 --> 00:10:22,824
It might be one of them new places
up to Crystal Highlands.

126
00:10:22,904 --> 00:10:25,665
No, this is supposed
to be in Silver Hill.

127
00:10:25,745 --> 00:10:27,905
There's a Silver Hill in Wyoming.

128
00:10:27,985 --> 00:10:30,385
See, Dad?

129
00:10:30,465 --> 00:10:33,585
This hotel was owned by
the late Jacob Barnsworth.

130
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:35,585
Jacob Barnsworth.

131
00:10:37,505 --> 00:10:39,745
Crazy Jake?

132
00:10:39,826 --> 00:10:42,986
- Why, he's dead.
- Well, I know that.

133
00:10:44,225 --> 00:10:46,345
If it's Crazy Jake's place
you're lookin' for...

134
00:10:46,425 --> 00:10:48,346
it's about a mile further out.

135
00:10:48,426 --> 00:10:51,107
You just stay on the same road
'til you hit the county road...

136
00:10:51,187 --> 00:10:54,746
Turn left along that road
'til you pass Howard Babcock's place.

137
00:10:54,826 --> 00:10:57,187
Uh, Babcock. Is there
a sign there or something?

138
00:10:57,267 --> 00:10:59,186
Oh, it blew off.

139
00:10:59,266 --> 00:11:02,786
Then you'll see a couple of Holsteins
on the south side of a red barn.

140
00:11:02,866 --> 00:11:06,186
Babcock told me he was gettin' some
Guernseys. He might've got 'em already.

141
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:09,866
- Uh, red barn. I'll find it.
- Just past the red barn...

142
00:11:09,946 --> 00:11:13,706
you'll hit a chuckhole; turn left,
down that road along the fence line.

143
00:11:13,787 --> 00:11:16,187
That'll take you
smack dab into the hotel.

144
00:11:16,267 --> 00:11:19,267
- Thanks.
- If the county's plowed the road.

145
00:11:20,987 --> 00:11:23,268
Are you related to Crazy Jake?

146
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:40,028
Are you related
to Crazy Jake, Dad?

147
00:11:40,108 --> 00:11:43,748
Uh, let's all keep
our eyes open for a red barn.

148
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:42,149
Dad? How bad did you
break it off with Mr. Carruthers?

149
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,350
Well, this is it, all right.

150
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,831
Well, let's see
what it looks like inside.

151
00:13:25,911 --> 00:13:27,831
All right.

152
00:13:51,391 --> 00:13:53,272
It's colder inside.

153
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:04,233
Well.

154
00:14:05,632 --> 00:14:08,713
It's gonna look a lot better
when we get a fire started.

155
00:14:08,794 --> 00:14:10,993
See if you can find
something to burn, Richard.

156
00:14:11,074 --> 00:14:14,352
- What about one of these chairs?
- No, I mean firewood.

157
00:14:14,432 --> 00:14:16,712
- Look in that box right there.
- Okay.

158
00:14:18,193 --> 00:14:20,753
- I've gotta get the electricity back on.
- Dad...

159
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,953
shouldn't we find someplace
to stay before it gets dark?

160
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:25,993
- We're gonna stay here.
- Overnight?

161
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:29,913
Well, why not?
It's a hotel, isn't it?

162
00:14:29,993 --> 00:14:33,914
It's just a bat!

163
00:14:36,554 --> 00:14:38,514
Richard.

164
00:14:40,353 --> 00:14:42,753
Johnny!

165
00:14:45,674 --> 00:14:49,473
It's gone. The thing was more
scared of us than we were of it.

166
00:14:49,553 --> 00:14:52,594
- Then that was one scared bat.
- Honey...

167
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:55,674
- they can't hurt you.
- But you know, in South America...

168
00:14:55,754 --> 00:14:59,275
they kill whole herds of cattle,
and they suck their blood at night...

169
00:14:59,355 --> 00:15:01,395
Richard!

170
00:15:01,475 --> 00:15:04,314
Now, that's enough.

171
00:15:07,996 --> 00:15:11,034
Hey, this is really a nice,
big kitchen we've got here.

172
00:15:11,114 --> 00:15:13,714
Does need a little brightening up.

173
00:15:16,155 --> 00:15:18,714
What?

174
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:21,154
There's someone in the oven.

175
00:15:26,316 --> 00:15:28,476
Uh, sorry.

176
00:15:28,556 --> 00:15:31,435
What was it?

177
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:34,835
- Raccoons. Four of them.
- Will you please tell me...

178
00:15:34,915 --> 00:15:37,955
how I'm supposed to cook
around four raccoons?

179
00:15:38,035 --> 00:15:40,596
Don't you worry about it.
I'll get rid of them.

180
00:15:40,676 --> 00:15:43,355
Like you got rid of Stoutheart
when Richard brought him home.

181
00:15:43,435 --> 00:15:46,556
We'd better get some things
out of the car before it gets dark.

182
00:15:49,756 --> 00:15:52,596
- We'll give you a hand.
- We can manage.

183
00:15:52,676 --> 00:15:55,716
Just see if you can find us
someplace to sleep.

184
00:16:00,597 --> 00:16:03,556
Okay, son, you...
you build a fire...

185
00:16:03,636 --> 00:16:07,996
and I'll go upstairs and see
if I can find us a place to sleep.

186
00:16:08,116 --> 00:16:10,036
- Dad?
- Hmm?

187
00:16:10,156 --> 00:16:13,436
Bears wouldn't hibernate
in a place like this, would they?

188
00:16:13,516 --> 00:16:17,037
Bears? No, Richard,
bears wouldn't hibernate in a...

189
00:16:18,797 --> 00:16:20,837
How would they get in?

190
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:23,358
How'd the bats
and the raccoons get in?

191
00:16:26,957 --> 00:16:29,718
Start the fire, Richard.

192
00:16:45,918 --> 00:16:48,918
You're in this with the rest of us.
Come on.

193
00:16:48,998 --> 00:16:53,278
Well, come on, Stoutheart.
No one's going to carry you.

194
00:16:54,998 --> 00:16:57,399
Hey! Come on up here.
I want to show you what I found.

195
00:16:57,479 --> 00:17:00,438
- A bear?
- Oh, no, it's not...

196
00:17:00,517 --> 00:17:04,359
It's not very funny, Richard.

197
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:19,598
Now that's funny.

198
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,360
I'm glad you think so!

199
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,839
Hey, lady, you're beautiful
when you're angry.

200
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:35,679
- You wouldn't.
- Wouldn't I?

201
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,799
You're gonna get it now.

202
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,360
Look out there, boy.

203
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,240
- Oh!
- Gotcha!

204
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:29,921
No way!

205
00:18:31,241 --> 00:18:34,041
Come on. Get off.

206
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:38,082
I thought you'd appreciate
the warm spot.

207
00:18:38,162 --> 00:18:41,281
I'll share yours.
Whoo!

208
00:18:43,561 --> 00:18:46,563
Mmm. You're like ice.

209
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:48,603
Nothing's permanent.

210
00:19:01,602 --> 00:19:03,522
Worried?

211
00:19:05,162 --> 00:19:07,122
Mmm.

212
00:19:09,122 --> 00:19:13,563
We still have $1,700.
It'll stretch a long way.

213
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,004
Mmm.

214
00:19:22,122 --> 00:19:24,202
We still have $1,700, don't we?

215
00:19:26,803 --> 00:19:30,723
The repair to the computer was $130,
and the lawyer got $1,000.

216
00:19:35,524 --> 00:19:38,404
You mean for a thousand dollars...

217
00:19:38,484 --> 00:19:41,723
we got legally stuck with this...

218
00:19:41,803 --> 00:19:43,724
clapboard igloo?

219
00:19:45,525 --> 00:19:47,444
Yeah, it's all in his letter.

220
00:19:47,524 --> 00:19:50,483
Transfer deed, title search
and a bunch of other stuff.

221
00:20:02,444 --> 00:20:04,644
Is that the kids?

222
00:20:06,085 --> 00:20:08,685
Probably the raccoons.

223
00:20:12,685 --> 00:20:17,165
If that's a raccoon,
that's a big raccoon.

224
00:20:21,364 --> 00:20:23,084
Take Stoutheart with you.

225
00:20:23,164 --> 00:20:25,805
What I don't need is
a 200-pound chicken.

226
00:20:26,845 --> 00:20:28,805
Take him.

227
00:20:32,325 --> 00:20:36,206
Okay, Snow King. Come on,
you're goin' with me. On your feet.

228
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:38,566
Dad!

229
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:40,567
- What was it?
- I don't know.

230
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:42,527
It sounds like
it's in the kitchen.

231
00:21:42,607 --> 00:21:45,648
- Here. You better take this.
- Okay.

232
00:21:50,448 --> 00:21:53,368
Come on, Stoutheart.

233
00:22:15,409 --> 00:22:18,808
This way, Stoutheart.

234
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,930
- Aha!
- Ahh!

235
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,330
Yah!

236
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:08,290
You horse's caboose!
Look what you done!

237
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,291
It was brand-full almost.

238
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:15,691
Stashed her here last summer,
just for a night like this.

239
00:23:17,331 --> 00:23:19,811
Now there ain't a sniff left.

240
00:23:19,891 --> 00:23:21,932
Of all the jangle-brained...

241
00:23:22,011 --> 00:23:25,732
You don't know split beans from coffee
comin' up on a person like that!

242
00:23:25,812 --> 00:23:30,132
Well, w... y... You're the one
that did the scaring. Who are you?

243
00:23:30,211 --> 00:23:32,131
Wh-Wh-What are you doing
in my hotel?

244
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:36,131
Oh, you the new
cock-a-doodle-do around here?

245
00:23:36,211 --> 00:23:41,652
W... I-It's my property, yes,
if that's what you mean... Who...

246
00:23:41,732 --> 00:23:44,571
I'd like to know what
some stranger is doing...

247
00:23:44,651 --> 00:23:46,652
roaming around the kitchen
in the middle of the night.

248
00:23:46,732 --> 00:23:49,492
Well, I'm hardly a stranger
to this place, mister.

249
00:23:49,572 --> 00:23:51,892
Name's Jesse McCord.
Jake grubstaked me...

250
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,893
and let me winter here
for 50 years.

251
00:23:53,973 --> 00:23:57,572
We was gonna split down the
middle soon as I made my strike.

252
00:23:57,652 --> 00:24:01,491
Yeah, well, okay. A lot of things
have changed around here now...

253
00:24:01,571 --> 00:24:04,852
and if you want to rent a room,
I've got plenty of them upstairs.

254
00:24:04,932 --> 00:24:07,172
How much you get for a bed?

255
00:24:08,172 --> 00:24:10,934
Just for yourself?

256
00:24:11,013 --> 00:24:15,052
I'm single and 75.
Does that answer your question?

257
00:24:16,733 --> 00:24:18,654
- Ten dollars.
- Oh.

258
00:24:18,734 --> 00:24:21,453
- In advance.
- In advance?

259
00:24:25,852 --> 00:24:29,933
It makes me real happy to see nice folks
like yourselves gettin' this place.

260
00:24:30,013 --> 00:24:32,173
It's been like a home to me.

261
00:24:37,134 --> 00:24:39,613
Listen at that wind.

262
00:24:44,534 --> 00:24:47,934
Oh, Johnny, maybe you'd better
drive him into town.

263
00:24:48,014 --> 00:24:51,773
Why, bless your heart, ma'am.
That's awful sweet of you.

264
00:24:51,854 --> 00:24:55,694
But no point goin' into town
without no place to stay.

265
00:24:55,774 --> 00:24:58,373
No, if I can just find me
a hollow tree someplace...

266
00:24:58,493 --> 00:25:00,374
I'll make out fine.

267
00:25:07,094 --> 00:25:10,295
- Yeah, that's what she is, a waziya.
- What's a waziya?

268
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:14,414
Waziya is cold wind that comes
sweepin' down off'n the mountains.

269
00:25:14,494 --> 00:25:17,496
It can freeze a body solid,
just like that.

270
00:25:17,576 --> 00:25:20,734
Lost me a partner
to a waziya once.

271
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:23,935
He went out to check his mule.
Wasn't gone more than 30 seconds.

272
00:25:24,015 --> 00:25:26,895
Time I got to him, him and
that mule was froze together.

273
00:25:26,975 --> 00:25:29,655
Looked like one of them
pioneer statues you see.

274
00:25:29,775 --> 00:25:32,495
How come you didn't freeze?

275
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:36,576
If you ain't bright as a button.
Well, now, I'll tell you why.

276
00:25:36,655 --> 00:25:39,215
He had a pint of antifreeze
in his radiator.

277
00:25:39,295 --> 00:25:41,896
That's about the size of it.

278
00:25:41,976 --> 00:25:46,096
Mr. Baxter, sir, if we don't
meet again in this world...

279
00:25:46,176 --> 00:25:48,935
I just want you to know
it's been a honor...

280
00:25:49,015 --> 00:25:53,176
just bein' here with you and your
wonderful family for this brief spell.

281
00:25:54,416 --> 00:25:56,696
Sonny, you be
a good little tyke...

282
00:25:56,776 --> 00:25:58,696
and help me up
with that pack.

283
00:25:58,776 --> 00:26:02,297
If I get keeled over too far,
'specially in winter...

284
00:26:02,377 --> 00:26:04,977
it's sometimes weeks
'fore I can get upright again.

285
00:26:06,536 --> 00:26:08,697
- Oh, Dad!
- John!

286
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:12,417
All right, all right.
He can stay.

287
00:26:12,497 --> 00:26:15,057
But you're gonna work,
just like everyone else.

288
00:26:15,137 --> 00:26:17,976
Mr. Baxter, sir,
I'm no stranger to hard work.

289
00:26:18,056 --> 00:26:20,016
I'll be the best bartender
you ever had.

290
00:26:20,096 --> 00:26:21,976
Bellhop.

291
00:26:22,056 --> 00:26:23,977
Should I put him in
the corner room, Dad?

292
00:26:24,057 --> 00:26:27,378
In the corner... Why not put him
in the presidential suite?

293
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:30,657
Fine with me.
Always did like that room.

294
00:26:30,737 --> 00:26:33,578
Well, we got ourselves
a bellhop cheap.

295
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:35,578
Is that a little too much
for you there, sonny?

296
00:26:35,658 --> 00:26:37,937
- Let me take the bedroll.
- No, it's okay.

297
00:26:38,057 --> 00:26:41,299
I've found if you put that
a little higher up on your back...

298
00:26:41,379 --> 00:26:43,618
it's easier to manage.

299
00:26:43,698 --> 00:26:46,937
She was takin' in $14,000 a month
easy in them days.

300
00:26:47,017 --> 00:26:50,378
Soon as the mines played out, of course,
the Grand Imperial started downhill.

301
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:53,098
Yes, sir, Jake was just
different from most folks.

302
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:56,617
Like he most always would have
some bird in here with a busted wing.

303
00:26:56,697 --> 00:26:59,699
Or he'd carry hay up to Deer Flats
if the snow was too deep.

304
00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:02,338
Or took care of the Indians
when hard times hit 'em.

305
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:04,378
There are Indians around here?

306
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:07,699
Used to be lots of 'em, but they's
mostly died off or moved away.

307
00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:09,699
Johnny.

308
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:12,778
- What's wrong?
- I was drawing a pail of water...

309
00:27:12,858 --> 00:27:16,978
to mop the kitchen floor,
and look what came out of the faucet.

310
00:27:17,098 --> 00:27:19,098
- A fish?
- A fish!

311
00:27:19,178 --> 00:27:22,299
A guppy. They's always gettin'
sucked out of the pond.

312
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,499
- You mean we have fish in our water?
- Can't harm you none, ma'am.

313
00:27:25,579 --> 00:27:27,499
But they're curious
little fellers.

314
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:30,980
That's why Jake put that
strainer over the bathtub.

315
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:34,460
Uh, now don't worry about it,
honey, because I'll get it fixed.

316
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,860
When? And with what?

317
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,819
Well, uh, I'm gonna get a loan.

318
00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:43,539
- You caught me at a bad time.
- I meant a bank loan.

319
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:47,140
A lot of things need fixing: the water
heater, the carpeting upstairs...

320
00:27:47,219 --> 00:27:50,060
and the, the, the...
Is there a bank in town?

321
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,060
Bank of Silver Hill.

322
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,419
- Owned by a man named Ridgeway.
- Ridgeway?

323
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:58,060
Well, now, that's the man that's
interested in buying this property.

324
00:27:58,181 --> 00:28:00,901
- How much do you intend to borrow?
- I don't know.

325
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:02,901
Enough to do it up right.

326
00:28:03,021 --> 00:28:05,133
We're gonna run a hotel,
let's run a first-class hotel, right?

327
00:28:05,474 --> 00:28:06,881
Right.

328
00:28:07,461 --> 00:28:09,621
- Right.
- Wrong.

329
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,581
As a collateral risk, your hotel
is all wrong, for my bank, at any rate.

330
00:28:13,661 --> 00:28:18,260
Well, uh, I do feel that
the hotel has potential, and...

331
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,262
Mr. Baxter, have you
ever managed a hotel?

332
00:28:22,341 --> 00:28:24,981
- No.
- Run a restaurant?

333
00:28:25,061 --> 00:28:28,461
- Stocked a bar?
- Actually, no, but...

334
00:28:29,862 --> 00:28:32,302
I shouldn't think
it was too difficult.

335
00:28:32,382 --> 00:28:35,301
I mean, the beds
are all there, and, uh...

336
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:37,702
my wife Sue
is a very good cook.

337
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:40,142
Well, now, Mr. Baxter,
I would like to help you...

338
00:28:40,222 --> 00:28:44,701
but as president of this bank, my first
responsibility is to our depositors.

339
00:28:47,222 --> 00:28:51,542
Mr. Ridgeway, you, uh, offered to
buy the hotel... I have a letter here.

340
00:28:51,622 --> 00:28:54,102
That offer still stands.

341
00:28:54,182 --> 00:28:57,663
Then I don't understand. Why is it good
business for you and not for your bank?

342
00:28:57,743 --> 00:29:00,463
Well...

343
00:29:00,543 --> 00:29:02,463
I've never told
anybody this before...

344
00:29:02,542 --> 00:29:05,302
but I've had a dream
for some time...

345
00:29:05,382 --> 00:29:08,302
of making that old place
into a memorial for Jake.

346
00:29:09,902 --> 00:29:12,942
- A mem-memorial?
- Yes.

347
00:29:13,022 --> 00:29:15,703
The Jacob Barnsworth
Home For Boys.

348
00:29:17,663 --> 00:29:21,423
- How does that sound to you?
- Uh, very nice.

349
00:29:21,503 --> 00:29:24,704
Oh, fine. I'll be happy
to take it off your hands.

350
00:29:26,383 --> 00:29:31,063
Uh, Mr. Ridgeway, I think I really
should discuss this with my wife...

351
00:29:31,143 --> 00:29:34,143
- before I make any final decision.
- Oh, of course.

352
00:29:34,223 --> 00:29:37,423
It's just that I always feel if we can
do something for our fellow man...

353
00:29:37,503 --> 00:29:41,064
we should do it while we can,
but, uh, don't let me influence you.

354
00:29:41,144 --> 00:29:43,024
If you intend to go
through with this...

355
00:29:43,104 --> 00:29:46,584
I'd be the last person
to discourage you.

356
00:29:53,984 --> 00:29:57,025
The Jacob Barnsworth
Home For Boys?

357
00:29:58,103 --> 00:30:00,783
If that fool knew
what he had there...

358
00:30:00,864 --> 00:30:04,344
he wouldn't be coming
in here hat in hand.

359
00:30:08,144 --> 00:30:12,425
Well, maybe we'd just be
throwing good money after bad.

360
00:30:12,505 --> 00:30:16,384
Maybe. But I think
we could have made it work.

361
00:30:16,464 --> 00:30:20,225
Oh, we'd never get rich,
but it would have been a good life.

362
00:30:21,426 --> 00:30:23,866
Not only for the kids, but for us.

363
00:30:25,345 --> 00:30:28,025
- I kind of like it here.
- So do I.

364
00:30:28,106 --> 00:30:30,105
Raccoons and all.

365
00:30:40,146 --> 00:30:42,506
Hi. You takin'
a walk in the snow?

366
00:30:42,586 --> 00:30:44,706
Yeah. That's
what we're doin'.

367
00:30:44,786 --> 00:30:47,226
Oh, I'm Wally Perkins.

368
00:30:47,306 --> 00:30:50,586
Remember? Uh,
from the gas station?

369
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:53,107
- Oh, yes. How are you?
- Oh, okay.

370
00:30:53,187 --> 00:30:57,065
Gordon Bowers' pipes froze last night,
and I was givin' him a hand...

371
00:30:57,145 --> 00:30:59,866
but my blowtorch
set his wall on fire.

372
00:30:59,947 --> 00:31:02,187
He sure gets mad easy.

373
00:31:02,267 --> 00:31:05,506
- Uh, how's the family?
- Fine.

374
00:31:05,586 --> 00:31:07,826
“Standaroules Plumbarmacy?”

375
00:31:07,906 --> 00:31:11,387
Oh, that was Standard Plumbing
and Sproule's Pharmacy.

376
00:31:11,507 --> 00:31:13,506
See, this used to be two snowmobiles.

377
00:31:13,587 --> 00:31:16,548
Well, three countin' the motor. They got
totalled in last year's cross-country,

378
00:31:16,628 --> 00:31:21,348
- and I collected the pieces.
- What's a cross-country?

379
00:31:21,426 --> 00:31:23,746
Oh, the Silver Hill Annual
Cross-country Snowmobile Race.

380
00:31:23,826 --> 00:31:26,787
Folks around here
hold it every year.

381
00:31:26,867 --> 00:31:30,467
Martin Ridgeway's won it
three years in a row, you know.

382
00:31:30,547 --> 00:31:33,268
- How's the family?
- Oh, fine.

383
00:31:33,348 --> 00:31:36,588
Chris is in the kitchen.
Why don't you go down and say hello?

384
00:31:36,668 --> 00:31:39,268
Oh. Okay.

385
00:31:39,348 --> 00:31:41,988
Uh, gee, I hope you don't mind
me makin' tracks in your snow.

386
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:45,228
Help yourself.

387
00:31:48,308 --> 00:31:50,748
- Wait a minute!
- What?

388
00:31:51,908 --> 00:31:56,227
- Well, what?
- Is all this my snow?

389
00:31:57,748 --> 00:31:59,909
Uh, I guess so,
if you want it.

390
00:32:02,149 --> 00:32:05,869
W... Well...
Di...

391
00:32:05,949 --> 00:32:09,189
Didn't Jesse say that the property
went back into those hills?

392
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:11,189
I didn't pay
much attention.

393
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:13,749
Yeah, it goes back
as far as you can see.

394
00:32:13,829 --> 00:32:15,750
Well, we know this is ours.

395
00:32:19,949 --> 00:32:22,389
Look at all this precious,
beautiful stuff!

396
00:32:23,949 --> 00:32:27,309
You can't get much for snow
around here, you know.

397
00:32:27,389 --> 00:32:30,429
Whoo-hoo!

398
00:32:30,509 --> 00:32:33,430
Johnny, what's going on?

399
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:38,030
Susie, what's the most popular sport
in the country right now?

400
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,071
- Bowling.
- No, no, no. Baseball?

401
00:32:40,151 --> 00:32:42,231
- Tennis.
- Ping-Pong?

402
00:32:42,311 --> 00:32:46,669
Honey, what do the Pfeiffers do
every weekend? And Roy and Barbara?

403
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,870
- Go skiing.
- That's right.

404
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:51,550
And half the time they claim
they can't get accommodations.

405
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,550
You mean...

406
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:57,710
- turn the hotel into a ski lodge?
- Yes!

407
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:01,111
People will come from all over
the country to ski a hill like that.

408
00:33:01,191 --> 00:33:04,070
But, Johnny, doesn't it cost a fortune
to start something like that?

409
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,511
Don't worry. Ridgeway
will loan me money on this.

410
00:33:06,591 --> 00:33:09,951
- Don't bet on it.
- Okay, I'll go to another bank!

411
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:13,391
What about Crystal Highlands?
They got banks over there, don't they?

412
00:33:13,471 --> 00:33:16,110
- Sure, a couple of good ones.
- Well, there you are!

413
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:20,871
It can't help but be an instant
success, Mr. Wainwright.

414
00:33:20,951 --> 00:33:24,951
We could come to your bank
next year for more money to expand.

415
00:33:25,031 --> 00:33:28,431
Oh, it's very accessible, yes, sir.
Right outside Silver Hill.

416
00:33:29,992 --> 00:33:31,952
This afternoon.

417
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:34,271
Yes. Yes, sir. Oh...

418
00:33:34,351 --> 00:33:37,712
Well, of course I love to ski.
Doesn't everybody?

419
00:33:39,793 --> 00:33:41,912
Nothing like it, sir.

420
00:33:41,992 --> 00:33:45,912
That's fine, Mr. Wainwright.
1:00. I'll be there.

421
00:33:45,992 --> 00:33:48,592
He loves the idea.
Wants to meet this afternoon.

422
00:33:48,712 --> 00:33:50,592
- But, Johnny!
- Wally, do you have boots and skis...

423
00:33:50,712 --> 00:33:52,632
- and clothes I can borrow?
- Oh, sure!

424
00:33:52,752 --> 00:33:55,033
You love to ski?

425
00:33:55,113 --> 00:33:57,072
A bank is not gonna loan
money for a ski lodge...

426
00:33:57,153 --> 00:34:00,792
- to a guy that doesn't know anything about skiing.
- But...

427
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,912
I've got to make him think
I know what I'm doing.

428
00:34:02,992 --> 00:34:04,913
I made that mistake
with Ridgeway.

429
00:34:04,993 --> 00:34:07,273
Told him I didn't know anything
about running a hotel.

430
00:34:07,353 --> 00:34:10,032
I'm not gonna make
that same mistake twice.

431
00:34:14,793 --> 00:34:17,753
Uh, could you tell me
where the ski shop is?

432
00:34:36,994 --> 00:34:39,154
- Mr. Wainwright?
- Hey!

433
00:34:39,234 --> 00:34:41,633
- Watch it, Mac!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

434
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:43,673
- Oh!
- Whoops.

435
00:34:43,753 --> 00:34:47,435
Excuse me, Miss.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

436
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:55,315
- Mr. Wainwright?
- Mr. Baxter.

437
00:35:00,154 --> 00:35:03,675
- I really envy you, Baxter, in this new venture of yours.
- You do?

438
00:35:03,755 --> 00:35:08,354
Yes, I guess every skier dreams
of owning his own slope.

439
00:35:08,434 --> 00:35:11,435
But I'd never
have the courage...

440
00:35:11,515 --> 00:35:14,354
to chuck everything
and do it the way you are.

441
00:35:14,435 --> 00:35:17,155
Yes, sir, I envy you.

442
00:35:28,636 --> 00:35:32,394
Always like to check my bindings before
I get on this chair lift, don't you?

443
00:35:32,474 --> 00:35:34,434
Oh, always.

444
00:35:40,755 --> 00:35:44,237
Did you figure on any ancillary
activities at the lodge?

445
00:35:44,317 --> 00:35:47,556
Ah, oh, oh, yes.
There's bound to be some of that.

446
00:35:47,636 --> 00:35:49,956
You know how skiers are.

447
00:35:50,036 --> 00:35:52,557
Kind of
caught you there, didn't it?

448
00:35:52,637 --> 00:35:55,437
Heh-heh-heh.
Yeah.

449
00:36:04,397 --> 00:36:08,316
Some of the skiers call this run
“Nightmare Alley.”

450
00:36:08,436 --> 00:36:11,277
But I think you'll enjoy it.

451
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:21,997
You plan on putting in a chair lift
like this or starting with a rope tow?

452
00:36:22,117 --> 00:36:25,158
Uh, I was thinking
about a rope tow.

453
00:36:25,238 --> 00:36:29,438
- Uh, generally because it's cheaper.
- Good thinking.

454
00:36:29,517 --> 00:36:32,077
- Then you can expand later.
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

455
00:36:34,518 --> 00:36:36,958
Whoa!

456
00:36:42,037 --> 00:36:44,198
What do you...
What do you say they call this run?

457
00:36:44,278 --> 00:36:46,638
Nightmare Alley.

458
00:36:46,718 --> 00:36:48,678
Sounds like fun.

459
00:36:54,758 --> 00:36:57,678
- Whoa!
- Stop the chair.

460
00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:03,879
Uh, uh...

461
00:37:03,999 --> 00:37:05,879
- Could you give...
- Are you all right, sir?

462
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:07,919
- Here, let me give you a hand.
- No, I got it.

463
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,759
No, no, no, no.

464
00:37:13,879 --> 00:37:15,760
Cr-Crossed up there.

465
00:37:16,919 --> 00:37:18,879
Okay, now, good.

466
00:37:27,759 --> 00:37:29,679
Well, there she is,
Nightmare Alley.

467
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,520
- How about a cup of coffee?
- We'll be at the bottom in five minutes.

468
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,839
Then we can have lunch and
discuss your project in depth.

469
00:37:38,919 --> 00:37:40,920
Good, good.

470
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,800
- Well, you ready?
- Oh, I'm ready as I'll ever be. Ow!

471
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,280
- What's the matter?
- Oh, it's nothing.

472
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:00,160
It's an old football injury that
sometimes kind of acts up when I get...

473
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,200
Ooh-hoo.
Get my knee twisted.

474
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,881
Maybe we'd better wait a while
before we make the run.

475
00:38:04,961 --> 00:38:08,161
Oh, no, no, no. Now don't be silly.
I don't want to spoil...

476
00:38:08,241 --> 00:38:10,641
spoil your skiing.

477
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:13,361
You go on to the bottom. I'll take it
easy, and I'll meet you down there.

478
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:15,122
- You're sure?
- Oh, absolutely.

479
00:38:15,202 --> 00:38:17,042
I wouldn't
have it any other way.

480
00:38:17,122 --> 00:38:20,560
Well, all right. I'll see you later,
but you be careful.

481
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,761
I will.

482
00:38:32,362 --> 00:38:35,402
Excuse me. Where do I catch
the ski lift down the slo-o-pe?

483
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:37,482
Ahh!

484
00:38:46,281 --> 00:38:48,762
You idiot!

485
00:38:48,842 --> 00:38:50,922
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to do that.

486
00:38:51,002 --> 00:38:54,802
I started up there.
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

487
00:38:54,882 --> 00:38:57,283
Will you get out of here?

488
00:39:09,843 --> 00:39:12,283
Look out!

489
00:39:12,363 --> 00:39:14,603
Baxter! You're
skiing backwards!

490
00:39:14,683 --> 00:39:17,362
- Takes the strain off the old knee.
- Look out!

491
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:27,723
See you later.

492
00:39:38,645 --> 00:39:41,883
Look out.
Look out!

493
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:56,285
Oh, no.

494
00:39:58,044 --> 00:40:01,285
Look out!

495
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:05,165
Oh, ma'am, I'm very sorry.
I just couldn't help myself.

496
00:40:05,246 --> 00:40:07,325
Aren't you a tease.

497
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:11,085
Why did you pick me with so many
other pretty girls on the slope?

498
00:40:11,165 --> 00:40:15,085
Uh, uh, whoops.
You're slipping now. Slipping!

499
00:40:15,165 --> 00:40:18,084
No. Help.
Uh-oh. Oh!

500
00:40:30,806 --> 00:40:33,686
Look out below!

501
00:40:33,766 --> 00:40:36,326
Look out!
Clear the way!

502
00:40:41,966 --> 00:40:44,926
Whoa!

503
00:40:55,767 --> 00:40:57,887
- You all right?
- Huh?

504
00:40:57,967 --> 00:41:00,886
- You all right?
- Oh. I'm alive.

505
00:41:00,966 --> 00:41:03,127
- I'm alive.
- Let me help you.

506
00:41:03,207 --> 00:41:05,566
- Okay. Wait a minute.
- Easy now.

507
00:41:05,646 --> 00:41:08,846
- Easy now. Easy now.
- Wait a minute. Get this foot over.

508
00:41:08,927 --> 00:41:11,767
Thanks.
Oh, thanks a lot.

509
00:41:11,847 --> 00:41:14,127
- Oh, boy.
- There. You're all right.

510
00:41:14,207 --> 00:41:16,607
Hey, that was quite
a tumble you took there.

511
00:41:16,687 --> 00:41:20,047
- Well, I didn't mind at all.
- When you take a spill like that...

512
00:41:20,127 --> 00:41:23,607
there's only one thing to do: Get back
up on these skis and try it again.

513
00:41:23,687 --> 00:41:26,248
- Not too fast, and don't forget...
- I don't care if I never...

514
00:41:26,328 --> 00:41:29,168
Ho! Ho! Whoa.

515
00:41:29,248 --> 00:41:31,168
Whoa!

516
00:41:32,248 --> 00:41:34,167
Ho! Look out!

517
00:41:34,247 --> 00:41:36,368
Look out!

518
00:41:36,488 --> 00:41:38,528
Yell “track”
when you wanna pass!

519
00:41:38,608 --> 00:41:41,687
Track! Track!

520
00:41:44,928 --> 00:41:46,928
Oh! Track!

521
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,448
- Whoa!
- Track! Track!

522
00:41:55,209 --> 00:41:58,368
Track!
I need to track!

523
00:42:01,529 --> 00:42:03,849
Oh! Track!

524
00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:12,129
Oh, no.

525
00:42:12,208 --> 00:42:14,568
Ohhhh!

526
00:42:32,289 --> 00:42:34,410
Track.

527
00:42:36,969 --> 00:42:40,969
“Leaving a wake of destruction
from Farewell Gap to Aspen Flats...

528
00:42:41,089 --> 00:42:43,970
“where his wild run was
finally halted by a tree.

529
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:46,330
“The ski patrol had to recruit
volunteers...

530
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:49,450
“to remove John Baxter's
victims from the slopes...

00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:53,170

534
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:05,650

536
00:43:10,771 --> 00:43:13,371
- Anthropologist?
- Yeah.

537
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:15,651
“An anthropologist from Harvard...

538
00:43:15,731 --> 00:43:17,731
wants to measure
the thickness of Baxter's skull.”

539
00:43:17,811 --> 00:43:21,891
- Very funny.
- We've heard enough of that.

540
00:43:23,213 --> 00:43:25,332
It's good publicity anyway.

541
00:43:25,412 --> 00:43:27,612
It's bad for loans.

542
00:43:35,812 --> 00:43:38,731
- Is Mr. Baxter in?
- Are you from Harvard?

543
00:43:38,811 --> 00:43:40,812
- Harvard?
- Mr. Ridgeway!

544
00:43:40,892 --> 00:43:44,572
Oh, there you are,
Baxter. Yes.

545
00:43:44,652 --> 00:43:47,372
Well, it's nice of you
to drop by, Mr. Ridgeway.

546
00:43:47,492 --> 00:43:52,012
Well, I, uh, I see you made
quite a hit at Crystal Highlands.

547
00:43:52,092 --> 00:43:54,251
- Why, yes.
- And this must be Mrs. Baxter?

548
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:56,772
- Yes, and this is my son, Richard.
- Hi.

549
00:43:56,852 --> 00:43:58,972
How do you do?
Tell me, what's his name?

550
00:43:59,052 --> 00:44:02,572
- Oh, this is Stoutheart.
- Well, how are ya, big fella?

551
00:44:02,652 --> 00:44:06,493
- Stoutheart!
- Richard, I think you better take him to the kitchen.

552
00:44:06,573 --> 00:44:09,573
Come on, boy.

553
00:44:11,653 --> 00:44:13,854
Dogs are a good judge
of character, you know.

554
00:44:15,614 --> 00:44:17,814
- He's, uh...
- Say, tell me, Baxter...

555
00:44:17,894 --> 00:44:22,174
in light of your experience, would you care
to reconsider my offer to buy this place?

556
00:44:22,254 --> 00:44:26,333
Mr. Ridgeway, I think I'll stay
with my plans for a ski lodge.

557
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:29,453
Well, I tell ya, if you're determined
to follow your dream...

558
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:32,694
I'd like to help
make it come true.

559
00:44:32,774 --> 00:44:34,694
- You would?
- Sure.

560
00:44:34,774 --> 00:44:37,733
How much do you need
to open these doors here?

561
00:44:37,813 --> 00:44:40,215
- 25,000.
- I'll loan you three.

562
00:44:41,334 --> 00:44:44,294
Well, that would open
one door, partway.

563
00:44:44,374 --> 00:44:46,294
I'll take it.

564
00:44:46,374 --> 00:44:49,454
That's my trouble.
I always let my heart rule my head.

565
00:44:49,534 --> 00:44:53,174
Johnny, may I speak to you
for a minute?

566
00:44:53,254 --> 00:44:56,975
I took the liberty of bringing
this form along, just in case.

567
00:44:57,055 --> 00:44:59,814
If you'll just sign all those X's,
it'll save you...

568
00:44:59,894 --> 00:45:02,054
a trip to town.

569
00:45:03,536 --> 00:45:05,735
Mr. Baxter, I think
these oughta do it.

570
00:45:05,815 --> 00:45:08,135
- Oh, fine, Wally. Go to work.
- Oh, hi, Mr. Ridgeway.

571
00:45:08,215 --> 00:45:11,775
- What are you doing here?
- I'm fixing their water heater.

572
00:45:11,855 --> 00:45:13,656
I thought you were
working for Double L.

573
00:45:13,736 --> 00:45:15,894
Oh, it's my day off.

574
00:45:17,735 --> 00:45:20,695
- Here you are.
- There you are. A check for $3,000.

575
00:45:20,775 --> 00:45:23,456
It's a pleasure doing
business with you, Mr. Baxter.

576
00:45:23,536 --> 00:45:26,815
I know you're going to make this place
into something real special.

577
00:45:26,895 --> 00:45:31,736
It's been a pleasure to meet you,
Mrs. Baxter. My very best to your son.

578
00:45:33,456 --> 00:45:35,856
Honey, I think we're in business.
I'll tell you what.

579
00:45:35,936 --> 00:45:37,937
Let's make a list of everything
we're gonna need, okay?

580
00:45:38,017 --> 00:45:40,656
- Johnny!
- Let's start with $500 for the bar.

581
00:45:40,776 --> 00:45:44,695
I'd like to have plenty of everything,
in case some weekend we're jammed up.

582
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:46,696
- Jammed up?
- In the kitchen.

583
00:45:46,776 --> 00:45:50,656
- What do we need in the kitchen?
- Johnny!

584
00:45:50,736 --> 00:45:53,216
I don't trust that Ridgeway.

585
00:45:53,296 --> 00:45:55,377
He wants this place
for something...

586
00:45:55,457 --> 00:45:58,257
and it's not a home
for wayward boys.

587
00:45:58,337 --> 00:46:01,576
Now, honey, can't you believe
that a successful man like Ridgeway...

588
00:46:01,656 --> 00:46:03,577
might want to give
somebody a helping hand?

589
00:46:03,657 --> 00:46:06,217
Not unless he made a buck,
he wouldn't.

590
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:10,377
Well, here's the proof.
Here's a check for $3,000.

591
00:46:10,457 --> 00:46:12,697
Now where were we?
You taking notes?

592
00:46:12,777 --> 00:46:16,377
$500 for the bar. We only
want to serve the finest food...

593
00:46:16,457 --> 00:46:19,377
so let's figure, oh, 500
to start for groceries.

594
00:46:19,457 --> 00:46:24,217
I don't recollect it
taking on like that before.

595
00:46:24,297 --> 00:46:28,218
...things like that, let's figure
300 at the outside.

596
00:46:28,298 --> 00:46:31,457
- Ooh! Dadburn it.
- Now try it.

597
00:46:34,498 --> 00:46:37,219
Now there's no water at all.

598
00:46:37,299 --> 00:46:40,858
I wonder if I've got the inflow where
the safety valve's supposed to go.

599
00:46:40,938 --> 00:46:42,857
- What should we put for a ski instructor?
- They don't come cheap.

600
00:46:42,938 --> 00:46:46,578
- Well, I do.
- Have you ever been a ski instructor?

601
00:46:46,658 --> 00:46:49,618
No, but if I sew a band on my sleeve,
who'll know the difference?

602
00:46:49,697 --> 00:46:52,259
- Hundred a month and room and board.
- It's a deal.

603
00:46:52,339 --> 00:46:53,818
He's gonna live here?

604
00:46:53,938 --> 00:46:56,899
I don't think it's your
inflow or your outflow either.

605
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:03,620
What do you figure we need
for the dining room?

606
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:06,698
Glasses, dishes, stuff like that.
Couple hundred dollars?

607
00:47:10,339 --> 00:47:14,298
- What does that come to?
- Uh, $2,800.

608
00:47:14,418 --> 00:47:17,700
2,800. That's perfect. Still leaves us
$200 for a rope-tow engine.

609
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:19,700
What's a rope-tow engine?

610
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:23,619
Rope-tow engine is an engine
to run the rope tow.

611
00:47:23,699 --> 00:47:27,420
Can't have a ski slope without a tow.

612
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,020
She's gonna blow!

613
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:06,420
Well, it ain't too bad.

614
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:10,901
Figure 20 bucks for the windows,
175 for a new water heater.

615
00:48:10,981 --> 00:48:14,581
Which leaves nothing
for a rope-tow engine.

616
00:48:14,661 --> 00:48:18,502
Called 'em donkey engines. They could
worry a six-ton log out of the woods...

617
00:48:18,582 --> 00:48:21,981
so it shouldn't even breathe heavy
pullin' a few skiers on a rope.

618
00:48:22,061 --> 00:48:27,463
- Do you think it'll still run?
- Build you a head and find out.

619
00:48:27,543 --> 00:48:30,581
- Yeah, but how you gonna move it to the hotel?
- Oh...

620
00:48:30,661 --> 00:48:32,582
we can drag it out of here
easy enough.

621
00:48:32,662 --> 00:48:35,222
- Good, good.
- Gettin' it up the hill, though.

622
00:48:35,302 --> 00:48:37,302
Now that might be
somethin' else.

623
00:48:42,262 --> 00:48:46,102
- My Snowcat's broke.
- It was workin' two days ago.

624
00:48:46,182 --> 00:48:48,943
- Well, it's broke now.
- You afraid Ridgeway...

625
00:48:49,023 --> 00:48:51,063
wouldn't like it?

626
00:48:51,143 --> 00:48:53,223
You know Mr. Ridgeway
loaned me the money...

627
00:48:53,303 --> 00:48:55,503
- to get started.
- That don't mean diddly-squat.

628
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:58,782
Loaned me money on my house
three years ago, then laid me off here.

629
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:03,142
Now I'm rentin' from him. Sorry,
gents, the Snowcat is broke.

630
00:49:17,464 --> 00:49:20,344
Pete Bolles has a D-4
that'd pull it up the hill.

631
00:49:20,464 --> 00:49:23,184
- Dad?
- Wait a minute, son. What's a D-4?

632
00:49:26,183 --> 00:49:28,823
How 'bout it, Mr. Bolles?

633
00:49:30,263 --> 00:49:32,304
I'd really like
to help you fellas out...

634
00:49:32,384 --> 00:49:34,904
but if I was ever to lose
this rig on that hill...

635
00:49:34,983 --> 00:49:37,103
I'd be out of business
for over a month.

636
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:40,024
You understand
how it is, don't ya?

637
00:49:40,104 --> 00:49:42,024
I'm beginning to.

638
00:49:48,545 --> 00:49:50,465
I know what the problem is.

639
00:49:50,545 --> 00:49:53,944
Ridgeway owns the pink on it,
and Pete's behind in his payments.

640
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:55,944
- Dad!
- Not now, Richard.

641
00:49:56,024 --> 00:49:58,385
Can't you see I got
something on my mind?

642
00:50:05,785 --> 00:50:10,345
If you want to sing a few choruses
of “I told you so,” feel free.

643
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:12,906
I stepped right into
Ridgeway's parlor.

644
00:50:26,025 --> 00:50:28,145
Whole thing's goin'
down the drain.

645
00:50:31,466 --> 00:50:34,906
So let it go. It's not
the end of the world.

646
00:50:34,986 --> 00:50:37,987
I've never wanted anything
so much in my life.

647
00:50:42,027 --> 00:50:44,746
Oh! I forgot.

648
00:50:46,827 --> 00:50:50,026
From Richard,
whose lower lip is out a foot.

649
00:50:50,106 --> 00:50:53,066
Mmm, yeah, well.
I was a little hard on him today.

650
00:50:53,146 --> 00:50:56,107
He kept interrupting and...

651
00:50:56,227 --> 00:50:58,347
I was busy.

652
00:50:58,427 --> 00:51:03,587
“Dear Dad, if a donkey engine can pull
a six-ton log out of the woods...

653
00:51:04,747 --> 00:51:07,467
“why can't it pull itself up a hill?

654
00:51:07,547 --> 00:51:09,467
Respectfully,
your son Richard.”

655
00:51:17,186 --> 00:51:19,427
- Works beautifully, doesn't it?
- Can I blow it, Dad?

656
00:51:19,547 --> 00:51:21,467
Toot her.

657
00:51:21,547 --> 00:51:23,627
Attaboy.

658
00:51:26,787 --> 00:51:29,388
It's going!
Hi, Mom!

659
00:51:29,468 --> 00:51:31,467
We're doing it!

660
00:51:31,548 --> 00:51:34,188
How 'bout that?

661
00:51:35,787 --> 00:51:39,588
Toot the whistle again, Richard.

662
00:51:39,668 --> 00:51:43,269
You be careful too, Richard.

663
00:51:45,028 --> 00:51:47,668
- Not too fast.
- Here we come, Chrissy.

664
00:51:47,748 --> 00:51:51,468
- How did you figure this out? Hi, Mom!
- We started out...

665
00:51:51,548 --> 00:51:54,028
You're gonna make it!

666
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:02,149
- Be careful.
- We made it!

667
00:52:06,829 --> 00:52:09,229
We made it, Chrissy.

668
00:52:09,309 --> 00:52:11,190
- Course we made it.
- Dad!

669
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:13,589
- Aren't we going any higher than this?
- Course we are!

670
00:52:13,669 --> 00:52:15,589
- We're going clear to the top!
- All right!

671
00:52:15,669 --> 00:52:18,909
The tow rope's goin' clear to the top,
but the donkey engine stays here.

672
00:52:18,989 --> 00:52:20,909
This is the midway point, you see.

673
00:52:20,989 --> 00:52:23,149
Beginning skiers
will ski down from here.

674
00:52:23,229 --> 00:52:25,549
The advanced will come
all the way from the top...

675
00:52:25,629 --> 00:52:28,470
and right over there,
there's a place for a donkey...

676
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:31,390
for a bunny slope.

677
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:35,831
Anyway, it looks like
we're in business.

678
00:53:15,151 --> 00:53:17,072
Richard!

679
00:53:18,392 --> 00:53:20,311
Stop eating the crackers.

680
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,751
Nobody else is here to eat 'em.

681
00:53:25,153 --> 00:53:27,552
Well, now, there'll be
plenty of skiers around...

682
00:53:27,632 --> 00:53:29,551
just as soon as they discover us.

683
00:53:33,153 --> 00:53:36,351
There's the 2:50,
loaded with big-tippin' skiers...

684
00:53:36,431 --> 00:53:39,512
all headed for
Crystal Highlands.

685
00:53:39,592 --> 00:53:41,992
Can I go help Wally?

686
00:53:42,112 --> 00:53:45,352
No. I don't want you
near those explosives.

687
00:53:45,432 --> 00:53:47,312
Wally knows all about blasting.

688
00:53:47,392 --> 00:53:49,753
He knew all about
water heaters too.

689
00:53:49,833 --> 00:53:53,033
Shouldn't he have that stump
out by now?

690
00:53:53,113 --> 00:53:54,873
You'll know when she's out.

691
00:54:01,634 --> 00:54:04,272
She's out.

692
00:54:09,073 --> 00:54:11,073
- Is that the stump?
- If it ain't,

693
00:54:11,153 --> 00:54:13,473
start lookin' for a new ski instructor.

694
00:54:17,514 --> 00:54:19,754
Oh, darn.

695
00:54:48,955 --> 00:54:50,875
Oh, boy.

696
00:55:14,636 --> 00:55:16,916
The train's stuck.
There's been an avalanche.

697
00:55:16,996 --> 00:55:18,595
What?

698
00:55:18,675 --> 00:55:20,555
The train's stuck.
There's been an avalanche.

699
00:55:20,635 --> 00:55:22,756
An avalanche?

700
00:55:22,836 --> 00:55:24,756
Yeah, it blocked
the Crystal Highlands road.

701
00:55:24,836 --> 00:55:27,675
It's gonna take 'em
some time to dig it out.

702
00:55:27,755 --> 00:55:30,316
- I better call Crystal Highlands.
- Yeah.

703
00:55:30,396 --> 00:55:34,716
First thing to do is to get
them skiers in where it's warm.

704
00:55:40,156 --> 00:55:43,797
Well, you old claim jumper.

705
00:55:43,877 --> 00:55:45,796
I like the way you think.

706
00:55:45,876 --> 00:55:48,277
Break out the steaks, Susie,
and whip up the cheese fondue.

707
00:55:48,357 --> 00:55:52,037
We're about to be bustin'
at the seams with skiers.

708
00:55:58,397 --> 00:56:00,317
Get up there, boy.

709
00:56:00,397 --> 00:56:03,116
This is the most exciting thing
that's ever happened to me.

710
00:56:03,196 --> 00:56:05,597
I still don't know what could
have caused an avalanche.

711
00:56:05,717 --> 00:56:07,717
Probably just
a freak of nature.

712
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:10,716
- You can say that again, Miss Voight.
- You know...

713
00:56:10,796 --> 00:56:15,157
you're a real hero, Johnny,
the way you rescued us and everything.

714
00:56:15,237 --> 00:56:17,197
Is it okay
if I call you Johnny?

715
00:56:17,277 --> 00:56:21,198
Oh, sure, sure. We're very informal
at the Grand Imperial.

716
00:56:21,318 --> 00:56:25,357
- Good. And you can call me Naomi.
- Uh...

717
00:56:25,437 --> 00:56:28,117
Get up there, boy.

718
00:56:35,038 --> 00:56:37,518
It's not in the front,
but I'm sure you'll like it.

719
00:56:37,598 --> 00:56:40,198
- Miss, please.
- Jesse! Room 24, please.

720
00:56:40,278 --> 00:56:43,478
Miss, the name's Manescue.
This is Mrs. Manescue.

721
00:56:43,558 --> 00:56:48,359
- This is our son, Sidney.
- Which is your valise? This heavy one?

722
00:56:48,439 --> 00:56:52,358
Put your bags down here
and then register in the bar, please.

723
00:56:52,438 --> 00:56:55,199
Make yourselves at home,
and if you need anything, call.

724
00:56:55,279 --> 00:56:59,319
Dad, Dad. In a hot-buttered rum, what do
you heat first, the butter or the rum?

725
00:56:59,399 --> 00:57:01,319
- What?
- It's not in the bartender's manual,

726
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:03,400
- and I've gotta know...
- Just a minute, Chris.

727
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,399
You serve,
and I'll take over the bar.

728
00:57:05,479 --> 00:57:08,279
- Oh, Dad, thank you.
- Uh, Wally, look...

729
00:57:08,359 --> 00:57:11,160
get the sleigh, go back and
get another load of customers.

730
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,959
Hurry. They're gonna have
that train out pretty soon.

731
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:17,879
- Uh, who had the hot-buttered rums?
- Right here.

732
00:57:17,959 --> 00:57:21,720
- Double room with a cot!
- Aren't there any suites in this hotel?

733
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,439
I'm sorry, Mr. Manescue,
but it's the best we have.

734
00:57:24,519 --> 00:57:27,840
In fact, it's all we have. We're
almost filled up. Room 14, please.

735
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,880
- I'm sorry, my dear.
- Sidney, you stay down here until we get...

736
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,799
Uh, the matched luggage.

737
00:57:34,879 --> 00:57:37,481
Hey! What about these?

738
00:57:37,601 --> 00:57:40,720
Can't leave 'em in the lobby, mister.
Better bring 'em with you.

739
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,921
- Who's next?
- I am!

740
00:57:44,001 --> 00:57:47,440
Miss Naomi Voight.

741
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:51,280
Are you related to that nice, cute
Johnny? His older sister or something?

742
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,721
Or something.
Would you like a single?

743
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,721
Naturally.

744
00:57:58,521 --> 00:58:00,201
- Thank you.
- Next.

745
00:58:00,281 --> 00:58:03,401
I'd like a single.
I'm not married.

746
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:07,601
Daddy! Somebody in there
just ordered a Harvey Wallbanger.

747
00:58:07,721 --> 00:58:10,402
Is that really a drink,
or was he just putting me on?

748
00:58:10,482 --> 00:58:14,161
- Harvey Wallbanger?
- With a slice of cucumber.

749
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:18,041
- I'm pooped. Is that all of 'em?
- Until the next load.

750
00:58:18,121 --> 00:58:20,682
Jesse, take over the desk
while I start dinner.

751
00:58:24,481 --> 00:58:26,402
There's a fish in my drink.

752
00:58:27,722 --> 00:58:30,442
Not so loud.
Everybody'll want one.

753
00:58:38,202 --> 00:58:41,362
What a darling apron.

754
00:58:43,042 --> 00:58:45,603
- How'd you like a fat lip?
- Oh, yeah?

755
00:58:45,683 --> 00:58:48,442
- Yeah!
- Well, why don't you try?

756
00:58:48,522 --> 00:58:50,763
Uh, Richard, can I ta...

757
00:58:54,002 --> 00:58:56,322
Well, he started it.

758
00:58:56,402 --> 00:58:59,484
I don't care if my best pants get dirty.
I'm not gonna wear any apron!

759
00:58:59,604 --> 00:59:02,163
We'll talk about it later.

760
00:59:12,602 --> 00:59:15,684
Hi.

761
00:59:15,764 --> 00:59:17,684
Hello.

762
00:59:17,764 --> 00:59:20,483
- Everybody in bed?
- Finally.

763
00:59:21,844 --> 00:59:24,084
What do you think about
a couple of tennis courts...

764
00:59:24,165 --> 00:59:26,084
right over there?

765
00:59:26,164 --> 00:59:28,284
Come spring, of course.

766
00:59:29,284 --> 00:59:31,244
Perfect.

767
00:59:34,325 --> 00:59:38,644
- You tired?
- Oh, I'm exhausted.

768
00:59:41,724 --> 00:59:44,244
- How 'bout you?
- Mmm.

769
00:59:44,324 --> 00:59:47,204
Happy exhausted.

770
00:59:47,284 --> 00:59:49,405
People seem to like
the place, don't they?

771
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:51,445
Yeah. All except
the Manescues...

772
00:59:51,525 --> 00:59:54,205
and they'd find somethin'
wrong with the Taj Mahal.

773
00:59:55,844 --> 01:00:00,245
If we can keep them happy for two
weeks, we'll be out of the woods.

774
01:00:01,845 --> 01:00:05,245
If you get much nicer
to Naomi Tight-pants...

775
01:00:05,324 --> 01:00:07,565
she might stay
through the spring.

776
01:00:09,165 --> 01:00:11,564
Just tryin' to be
a good host, ma'am.

777
01:00:11,644 --> 01:00:15,326
Well, room service
is closed for the night.

778
01:00:17,326 --> 01:00:19,246
You nut.

779
01:00:21,486 --> 01:00:25,046
- Oh!
- Who's that?

780
01:00:25,126 --> 01:00:28,246
- Well, it's our room. It's Miss Ogelvie.
- Oh! Oh!

781
01:00:32,406 --> 01:00:35,566
Miss Ogelvie, what happened?

782
01:00:35,646 --> 01:00:37,965
I just turned out the lights
and got into bed, and he...

783
01:00:38,045 --> 01:00:41,006
Now, now, I'll handle this,
Miss Ogelvie.

784
01:00:42,926 --> 01:00:45,126
What are you doing
in this lady's room?

785
01:00:45,206 --> 01:00:47,687
You have no business
coming in here uninvited.

786
01:00:47,767 --> 01:00:50,047
Now you get out of here
this minute.

787
01:00:50,127 --> 01:00:53,047
I'm sorry, Miss Ogelvie.
This will never happen again.

788
01:01:15,768 --> 01:01:19,167
How's the steam, Jesse?

789
01:01:19,287 --> 01:01:23,328
Fire's down a little. We might
could use a couple more chunks.

- How's the steam engine working?
- Perfect.

793
01:01:35,407 --> 01:01:37,728
That thing could pull
the whole town up the hill.

794
01:01:37,808 --> 01:01:39,728
- Need some help with that?
- No.

- Hey, where's Chris?
- I let her go skiing.

Oh, it was so cuddly and snuggly

I just didn't
want to get up.

801
01:02:07,769 --> 01:02:09,968
Yeah, yeah,
I know what you mean.

802
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:15,530
Uh, the ski instructor's
starting his beginners class.

803
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:18,089
If you'd like to get out there, you
could probably get some skiing in.

804
01:02:18,169 --> 01:02:21,531
I was hoping you'd give me
private lessons, Johnny.

- Yeah, of course I ski.

That's gonna happen to you
a lot on the slope.

812
01:02:53,251 --> 01:02:56,730
Okay. Now, the lesson today
will be straight running...

813
01:02:56,850 --> 01:02:59,450
or schussing, as it's called.

814
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:02,572
Well, I guess the best way to get
the hang of it is just to try it.

you go first.

But, really, perhaps one
of the others might...

819
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:17,251
There's nothing to be scared of,
Miss Grable. I'll go down with you.

820
01:03:17,331 --> 01:03:22,211
Now remember, just relax
and flex the knees.

- Er, f-flex the kn-knees.
- Good. Come on. Come on.

822
01:03:26,572 --> 01:03:28,812
Come on. Very good!

823
01:03:28,892 --> 01:03:30,812
Very good, Miss Grable.

824
01:03:30,892 --> 01:03:33,731
N-Not so fast!
Snowplow, Miss G-Grable!

825
01:03:33,811 --> 01:03:35,732
- What plow?
- Aah!

826
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:38,052
Aah! Aah!

827
01:03:39,413 --> 01:03:41,413
Oh, no!

828
01:03:41,493 --> 01:03:44,173
Man overboard!

829
01:03:45,133 --> 01:03:47,092
Help!

830
01:03:47,172 --> 01:03:51,132
Help! We need help!
The instructor's gone over the side!

831
01:03:51,212 --> 01:03:55,133
- What'd he say?
- He said somebody went over the side.

832
01:03:56,372 --> 01:03:58,492
Help!

833
01:04:02,653 --> 01:04:05,533
- Somebody help!
- It's Wally!

834
01:04:05,613 --> 01:04:07,893
Wally!

835
01:04:09,094 --> 01:04:12,814
Man over the side!

836
01:04:15,253 --> 01:04:17,654
- What happened?
- Wally!

837
01:04:17,734 --> 01:04:21,133
He went over the edge,
and he's hanging on a tree!

838
01:04:21,213 --> 01:04:23,293
Stop the tow!

839
01:04:26,934 --> 01:04:29,214
Ohh!

840
01:04:31,214 --> 01:04:34,894
- Hang on, Wally!
- I-I'm trying!

841
01:04:36,575 --> 01:04:38,495
Oh! Hey!

842
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:40,615
- Track!
- Aah!

843
01:04:40,695 --> 01:04:42,615
No, no, don't track!

844
01:04:43,694 --> 01:04:45,854
- Oh. Oh, boy.
- You all right?

845
01:04:45,934 --> 01:04:48,214
- Yeah.
- Ohh!

846
01:04:48,294 --> 01:04:50,215
Oh, no.

847
01:04:50,295 --> 01:04:52,655
- Daddy, what are we gonna do?
- Well...

848
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:55,774
Run this around that tree over there
and bring it to your pa.

849
01:04:55,855 --> 01:04:59,495
Tell him I'll lower him down
with the donkey engine.

850
01:04:59,575 --> 01:05:01,495
- Stay calm!
- Daddy, you've got to do something!

851
01:05:01,575 --> 01:05:04,375
- Please! Please!
- We will, honey. We will, but...

852
01:05:04,455 --> 01:05:06,375
H-How about a helicopter?

853
01:05:06,456 --> 01:05:08,376
They use helicopters
sometimes, don't they?

854
01:05:08,456 --> 01:05:10,495
Dad, Jesse says he can let
you down on the tow rope.

855
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:13,215
- Good. What?
- Hold on, Wally!

856
01:05:13,295 --> 01:05:15,895
- Daddy's coming to get you!
- Now, wait...

857
01:05:17,096 --> 01:05:19,016
I'll hold on!

858
01:05:19,096 --> 01:05:21,136
Come on, you can do it!

859
01:05:21,216 --> 01:05:23,137
- Go on!
- You can do it!

860
01:05:23,217 --> 01:05:25,896
Go get him!

861
01:05:25,976 --> 01:05:27,896
Let the line...
Let some rope out.

862
01:05:27,976 --> 01:05:29,976
Let out more rope!

863
01:05:30,056 --> 01:05:31,976
Right!

864
01:05:33,217 --> 01:05:36,056
Hang on, Wally!
More rope!

865
01:05:36,136 --> 01:05:38,175
More rope!

866
01:05:40,456 --> 01:05:44,016
- You better hurry!
- Let it out!

867
01:05:49,857 --> 01:05:53,257
- Dad!
- Jesse, it's slipping!

868
01:05:54,536 --> 01:05:57,017
- Dad! Dad!
- Whoa!

869
01:05:57,097 --> 01:05:59,538
- Dad!
- Unh!

870
01:06:07,177 --> 01:06:12,337
I... I got you now, Wally.
Get your leg up.

871
01:06:28,378 --> 01:06:31,018
I sure hate to put you
to all this trouble, Mr. Baxter.

872
01:06:31,098 --> 01:06:34,698
- See, I was giving a lesson...
- Just shut up, Wally.

873
01:06:36,858 --> 01:06:38,779
Now, look.

874
01:06:38,859 --> 01:06:40,819
You hang on...

875
01:06:40,899 --> 01:06:43,778
and I'm gonna try
and turn myself around.

876
01:06:43,858 --> 01:06:47,059
- You all right, Dad?
- Perfect!

877
01:07:11,379 --> 01:07:14,179
- Aah!
- Easy!

878
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:19,780
Pu-Pull!

879
01:07:19,859 --> 01:07:22,460
Pull him up, Jesse!

880
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:28,460
Aah! Easy! Easy!

881
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:30,820
Easy! Easy!

882
01:07:32,419 --> 01:07:34,699
- He's got him!
- He's got him!

883
01:07:42,181 --> 01:07:44,301
- Come on!
- You can make it!

884
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:46,381
- Come on!
- Come up here!

885
01:07:48,701 --> 01:07:50,620
Oh, Dad,
you were great!

886
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:55,141
Don't mention it, Wally.

887
01:07:56,980 --> 01:08:00,221
- Oh, ow!
- Wally, your arm! You broke it!

888
01:08:00,301 --> 01:08:03,861
- No, I'm okay.
- We better get you to a doctor. Daddy!

889
01:08:03,941 --> 01:08:07,981
- You were great, Mr. Baxter.
- Daddy, we better get Wally to a doctor!

890
01:08:08,061 --> 01:08:09,981
Oh.

891
01:08:11,061 --> 01:08:15,261
Whoa!

892
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:18,302
Whoa! Gol darn your ornery hide!

893
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:22,422
Oh!

894
01:08:22,502 --> 01:08:24,942
Aah!

895
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:33,142
Jesse! Jesse!

896
01:08:44,383 --> 01:08:46,703
Jesse, stop that thing!

897
01:08:46,783 --> 01:08:49,343
You tell me how,
and I'll throw in with ya!

898
01:08:49,463 --> 01:08:51,502
- Daddy, let go!
- He can't!

899
01:08:51,582 --> 01:08:54,302
Boy, that's the best knot
I ever tied.

900
01:08:54,382 --> 01:08:57,183
Get out of the way!

901
01:08:57,263 --> 01:09:00,222
Out of the way!

902
01:09:01,624 --> 01:09:03,983
Get out of there!

903
01:09:05,263 --> 01:09:07,343
See? I told ya.

904
01:09:09,424 --> 01:09:13,064
Jesse, stop it!
The hotel!

905
01:09:17,265 --> 01:09:19,784
I don't know what's wrong,
but it's something.

906
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:21,824
The steam whistle's
been blowing like crazy.

907
01:09:24,264 --> 01:09:27,424
Turn it, Jesse!

908
01:09:27,504 --> 01:09:30,463
I don't know if we need
an ambulance, but...

909
01:09:30,543 --> 01:09:32,463
send one anyway.

910
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:35,264
Good-bye.

911
01:09:38,065 --> 01:09:40,425
Aah!

912
01:09:42,626 --> 01:09:45,225
- Jesse, where's Johnny?
- He's comin'!

913
01:09:49,784 --> 01:09:52,585
- Susie!
- Johnny! What happened?

914
01:09:52,665 --> 01:09:56,185
You wouldn't
believe it if I t...

915
01:10:24,626 --> 01:10:27,146
Then it went through one side
of the hotel and came out the other...

916
01:10:27,226 --> 01:10:29,865
made a disaster area
out of the dining room.

917
01:10:29,986 --> 01:10:33,746
I patched up what I could, but it still
gets a little breezy in there.

918
01:10:33,826 --> 01:10:36,787
And your guests, how are
they enjoying half a hotel?

919
01:10:36,907 --> 01:10:38,826
They aren't, are they?

920
01:10:38,906 --> 01:10:41,907
As a matter of fact,
they've all left, haven't they?

921
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:46,026
Yes, but they all did say
they had fun while it lasted.

922
01:10:46,106 --> 01:10:49,027
What you're trying
to say, in essence, is...

923
01:10:49,107 --> 01:10:52,747
that you'll be unable to meet
your obligation to the bank this month.

924
01:10:52,827 --> 01:10:55,347
Not and do the necessary
repairs to the hotel.

925
01:10:55,427 --> 01:10:58,028
I wanted to talk to you
about an extension, Mr. Ridgeway.

926
01:10:58,108 --> 01:11:01,427
- You see...
- Baxter, I like you.

927
01:11:02,987 --> 01:11:05,267
Well, thank you,
Mr. Ridgeway, I...

928
01:11:05,347 --> 01:11:07,268
like you too.

929
01:11:07,348 --> 01:11:11,067
And because I like you,
I'm going to do you a little favor.

930
01:11:11,147 --> 01:11:13,707
Rather than let you throw more
good money down that rat hole...

931
01:11:13,787 --> 01:11:16,747
and force me to all the unpleasantness
of getting a foreclosure...

932
01:11:16,867 --> 01:11:19,267
I'm going to take that white
elephant off your hands...

933
01:11:19,347 --> 01:11:22,469
and I'm going to give you,
out of my own pocket... not the bank's...

934
01:11:22,549 --> 01:11:25,068
I'm going to give you $200.

935
01:11:25,148 --> 01:11:28,108
Now, that should see you and that
sweet little family of yours...

936
01:11:28,188 --> 01:11:30,788
safe back to New York
where you belong.

937
01:11:30,868 --> 01:11:34,389
What do you say?

938
01:11:34,469 --> 01:11:39,908
That's very kind of you, Mr. Ridgeway.
I... But I do have until the 15th.

939
01:11:39,988 --> 01:11:43,108
Yeah, but that's five days from now.
How you gonna get the money by then?

940
01:11:43,188 --> 01:11:46,948
I don't know, but I'll get it.

941
01:11:47,028 --> 01:11:50,389
Well, George Spellman,
come right in. Come right in.

942
01:11:50,469 --> 01:11:53,388
Good to see you. Please sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

943
01:11:53,468 --> 01:11:55,748
How's that wonderful
family of yours?

944
01:12:13,789 --> 01:12:16,509
- Richard.
- Oh, see ya.

945
01:12:16,589 --> 01:12:20,189
- Where's Wally?
- I guess he's still at the doctor's.

946
01:12:20,309 --> 01:12:22,830
- What'd Mr. Ridgeway say?
- No.

947
01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:26,430
- Well, what are we gonna do?
- We're gonna win the Silver Hill snowmobile race...

948
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:28,430
- that's what we're gonna do.
- We are?

949
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:30,711
Yep. Wally's gonna drive, and I'm...

950
01:12:51,671 --> 01:12:53,751
- We'll turn that.
- Yeah.

951
01:12:56,951 --> 01:12:59,711
Do I understand
Richard correctly?

952
01:12:59,791 --> 01:13:03,791
Th-That you're driving
that thing in a race?

953
01:13:03,871 --> 01:13:06,471
Susie, we can't have
outside drivers.

954
01:13:06,551 --> 01:13:08,471
- That's the rules.
- It's a rule.

955
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:11,952
Until we arrived here,
you'd never seen a snowmobile before.

956
01:13:12,072 --> 01:13:14,312
And now you're going to race one
at 80 miles an hour?

957
01:13:14,392 --> 01:13:16,712
- Oh, no. 40, tops.
- Okay, now look.

958
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:20,072
I don't have to come in first.
See, there are three prizes.

959
01:13:20,152 --> 01:13:23,072
Now, any one of those prizes
would see us through 'til next fall.

960
01:13:23,152 --> 01:13:28,073
Johnny, you've become so obsessed
to hanging on to this place...

961
01:13:28,153 --> 01:13:30,552
- that you're not using good sense.
- Now, Susie, look...

962
01:13:30,632 --> 01:13:32,552
Look, I know
what it means to you.

963
01:13:32,672 --> 01:13:36,393
And you've done everything you can
to make a go of it. We all have.

964
01:13:36,473 --> 01:13:38,633
I put up with fish
in the water.

965
01:13:38,713 --> 01:13:42,152
- I know you have, hon.
- And exploding heaters.

966
01:13:42,232 --> 01:13:45,273
And steam engines
breaking through the house.

967
01:13:46,793 --> 01:13:50,033
But I'm not gonna stand here
and watch you get yourself killed.

968
01:13:50,153 --> 01:13:52,233
- Susie.
- Well, I'm giving him a crash program...

969
01:13:56,153 --> 01:13:59,233
Now listen to me, Johnny.

970
01:13:59,313 --> 01:14:03,353
You go through with this crazy idea
of yours and I'm leaving.

971
01:14:04,993 --> 01:14:07,753
I can't take any more.

972
01:14:17,514 --> 01:14:20,474
A man does what
he's gotta do, Mr. Baxter.

973
01:14:21,554 --> 01:14:24,634
Just shut up, Wally.

974
01:14:24,714 --> 01:14:29,114
Hibler's Department
Store has asked me to announce...

975
01:14:29,194 --> 01:14:34,714
the annual award for most original
paint design and uniform coordination...

976
01:14:34,794 --> 01:14:38,794
has been increased to $175.

977
01:14:51,114 --> 01:14:54,475
The route this year is the same as last.

978
01:14:54,555 --> 01:14:56,555
Down Main Street...

979
01:14:56,675 --> 01:14:58,595
It'll hold this time.

980
01:14:58,675 --> 01:15:00,596
And it's gonna
snow roses any minute now.

981
01:15:00,676 --> 01:15:03,595
- Jesse, if you don't want to do this, just say so.
- I don't want to do this.

982
01:15:03,675 --> 01:15:05,875
All I'm saying is,
God never intended man...

983
01:15:05,955 --> 01:15:07,996
to travel 80 miles an hour over snow.

984
01:15:08,076 --> 01:15:09,996
And if he did,
it wasn't in no contraption...

985
01:15:10,076 --> 01:15:11,996
put together with spit
and baling wire.

986
01:15:12,076 --> 01:15:15,355
- That's all I'm saying.
- Have you seen Sue and the kids?

987
01:15:15,435 --> 01:15:19,396
They're in Denver by now,
where I'd be if I had any good sense.

988
01:15:24,395 --> 01:15:26,316
That's it.

989
01:15:26,396 --> 01:15:28,876
Wally, you wired me
to the carburetor.

990
01:15:28,956 --> 01:15:32,236
- Get...
- Oh. I'm sorry.

991
01:15:35,756 --> 01:15:38,957
The Tate Brothers, Dean and Brian!

992
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:44,117
Running good!
And driving the Red Devil...

993
01:15:44,197 --> 01:15:49,276
for Silver Hill Bank, the winner of the
grand prize for the past two years...

994
01:15:49,396 --> 01:15:55,037
Martin Ridgeway
and Double L Dingman.

995
01:15:55,117 --> 01:15:59,638
And in the second row,
a late entry not in your program.

996
01:15:59,718 --> 01:16:02,117
Driving the Mighty Mongrel...

997
01:16:02,197 --> 01:16:04,397
Mighty Mongrel?

998
01:16:04,477 --> 01:16:06,277
Yeah,
the Mighty Mongrel!

999
01:16:06,357 --> 01:16:09,678
Representing
the Grand Imperial Hotel...

1000
01:16:09,758 --> 01:16:13,478
John Baxter and Jesse McCord.

1001
01:16:13,558 --> 01:16:16,358
Gentlemen, are you ready
for the start?

1002
01:16:35,558 --> 01:16:37,878
This ain't as bad
as I thought, Johnny.

1003
01:16:37,958 --> 01:16:42,919
The kickstand!

1004
01:16:43,039 --> 01:16:44,958
- Oh.
- Push it off!

1005
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:54,199
You all right?

1006
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,880
You're okay.

1007
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:01,919
- You all right?
- For a 75-year-old papoose...

1008
01:17:01,999 --> 01:17:04,639
that just got dumped
on his head, I'm fine.

1009
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:06,840
Go get 'em!

1010
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:25,120
We'll never catch up!

1011
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,120
We'll catch up!

1012
01:17:30,441 --> 01:17:32,400
Lean!

1013
01:17:57,722 --> 01:18:01,241
In the turns,
lean the way I lean!

1014
01:18:01,321 --> 01:18:03,802
I'm havin' enough
trouble just hangin' on!

1015
01:18:29,162 --> 01:18:30,963
Right!

1016
01:18:39,402 --> 01:18:42,682
Look out!

1017
01:18:46,083 --> 01:18:48,963
- Watch where you're goin'!
- I can't see where we're going!

1018
01:19:24,484 --> 01:19:26,404
That does it.

1019
01:19:31,084 --> 01:19:33,684
We're travelin' now, Jess!

1020
01:19:52,925 --> 01:19:56,246
How'd you get ahead of me?
Never mind. Tell me later. Get on.

1021
01:19:56,326 --> 01:19:58,645
Johnny, I wouldn't get
on a three-week toot with you...

1022
01:19:58,725 --> 01:20:00,805
if you paid for it and throwed in
the Dolly sisters!

1023
01:20:00,885 --> 01:20:03,645
Now, listen, Jesse. We can't win
unless we finish with two riders.

1024
01:20:03,725 --> 01:20:05,365
Get on this thing!

1025
01:20:05,445 --> 01:20:08,565
Not on your life!
You let me off this thing!

1026
01:20:16,085 --> 01:20:18,567
We're catching up!

1027
01:20:22,726 --> 01:20:24,926
Hey!

1028
01:20:25,006 --> 01:20:26,966
How'd you get up here?

1029
01:20:27,046 --> 01:20:29,445
- I flew up here, how do you think?
- Well, I can't see!

1030
01:20:29,525 --> 01:20:32,486
- Get back to where you belong!
- Fine with me. How do I do that?

1031
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:37,127
Jesse, hang on.
Don't hold on to the steering!

1032
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:39,127
Get back and sit down!

1033
01:21:17,208 --> 01:21:19,809
Look out, Johnny!

1034
01:21:25,288 --> 01:21:27,928
If we come out of this alive,
and I don't figure to...

1035
01:21:28,008 --> 01:21:30,248
- will you do me a favor?
- What?

1036
01:21:30,328 --> 01:21:33,809
Fire me!
Slow 'er down, Johnny.

1037
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:36,768
I can't!
The throttle's stuck!

1038
01:22:36,970 --> 01:22:39,050
It's them!
They're gainin' on us!

1039
01:22:39,131 --> 01:22:41,251
Give it the gas!
Come on!

1040
01:22:43,091 --> 01:22:45,890
- They're comin'!
- Aw, shut up!

1041
01:22:47,571 --> 01:22:49,931
We're comin'
into Split Rock Pass!

1042
01:22:54,890 --> 01:22:56,811
You'll never
get by 'em, Johnny!

1043
01:22:56,891 --> 01:22:59,251
This road's got more crooks
than a miners' convention!

1044
01:22:59,331 --> 01:23:00,971
We'll get by 'em!

1045
01:23:18,292 --> 01:23:20,572
Ridgeway,
you horse's caboose!

1046
01:23:21,572 --> 01:23:23,972
- Look out, Johnny!
- Get it over!

1047
01:23:33,292 --> 01:23:36,012
Whoa!

1048
01:23:41,292 --> 01:23:43,212
Johnny?

1049
01:23:43,292 --> 01:23:45,212
I'm here...

1050
01:23:45,292 --> 01:23:47,412
but I'm not sure where here is.

1051
01:23:47,493 --> 01:23:49,973
We dead?

1052
01:23:50,053 --> 01:23:52,933
I didn't want to be
the first to mention it.

1053
01:23:53,013 --> 01:23:56,413
Johnny, I hate to add to your troubles,
but it's gettin' hotter.

1054
01:23:56,493 --> 01:23:58,453
It sure is.

1055
01:23:58,573 --> 01:24:01,893
Must be that go-round I had
with the widow Corzine.

1056
01:24:01,973 --> 01:24:04,814
But, heck, that was 20 years ago,
and she started it.

1057
01:24:04,894 --> 01:24:08,333
I think we're moving.
Where's that light switch?

1058
01:24:11,174 --> 01:24:13,214
We're on a mine cart!

1059
01:24:13,294 --> 01:24:15,214
Must be the old
Hard Luck Mine.

1060
01:24:15,294 --> 01:24:18,653
They dug clean through the mountain.
Never did find a vein.

1061
01:24:20,814 --> 01:24:23,895
You mean this... this tunnel
goes clear through the mountain?

1062
01:24:24,014 --> 01:24:26,614
Yep, and all they got
was calluses.

1063
01:24:27,695 --> 01:24:29,775
Well, we'll save miles.

1064
01:24:31,255 --> 01:24:33,855
We'll get a big jump
on everybody!

1065
01:24:33,935 --> 01:24:36,654
You can say that agaaaain!

1066
01:24:46,895 --> 01:24:49,455
We've got a busted ski!

1067
01:24:51,735 --> 01:24:53,656
We'll never make her, Johnny!

1068
01:24:53,736 --> 01:24:55,736
That's the good ski that's busted...

1069
01:24:55,816 --> 01:24:57,896
and the steering's
got the wobblies!

1070
01:24:57,976 --> 01:25:00,376
It's just two miles, Jesse!

1071
01:25:04,895 --> 01:25:07,295
Look! How'd they get up there?

1072
01:25:07,375 --> 01:25:10,176
I don't know
how they got there!

1073
01:25:11,616 --> 01:25:14,416
There's the town!

1074
01:25:17,255 --> 01:25:20,216
Well, when they come,
they come like that.

1075
01:25:23,216 --> 01:25:28,577
Folks, we just had a report from the
Perkins farm. The leader just passed.

1076
01:25:28,657 --> 01:25:31,615
He'll be turning in at the head
of the street any second now...

1077
01:25:31,695 --> 01:25:34,496
so we're going to have to
clear the straightaway, folks.

1078
01:25:34,577 --> 01:25:36,817
Clear the straightaway.
Here he comes!

1079
01:25:36,897 --> 01:25:40,256
It's the Mighty Mongrel!

1080
01:25:45,297 --> 01:25:48,017
Steering's gone!

1081
01:26:03,257 --> 01:26:06,016
Folks, we've just had another report
from the Perkins farm.

1082
01:26:06,097 --> 01:26:09,898
Martin Ridgeway has just passed,
and he's headed this way full bore!

1083
01:26:09,978 --> 01:26:12,018
Ridgeway's just
comin' into town!

1084
01:26:12,097 --> 01:26:14,897
The Mighty Mongrel has suffered
a second broken ski.

1085
01:26:14,977 --> 01:26:18,298
It looks like three in a row
for Martin Ridgeway.

1086
01:26:18,378 --> 01:26:21,538
- Oh, yeah? Come on, let's turn this thing around.
- What?

1087
01:26:21,618 --> 01:26:24,899
We've gone this far on one ski. We can
go the rest of the way on no skis.

1088
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:29,218
All right, let's point it
towards the line.

1089
01:26:29,298 --> 01:26:33,018
Here he comes!
It's Martin Ridgeway!

1090
01:26:35,939 --> 01:26:38,539
Come on!
Ridgeway hit a snowbank!

1091
01:26:38,618 --> 01:26:41,739
- Of all the stupid things I've ever seen!
- I tried to lean left!

1092
01:26:41,819 --> 01:26:45,259
Why didn't you lean left
when you're supposed to?

1093
01:26:45,339 --> 01:26:49,138
Sit to the rear, Jesse.
Lean back and keep the nose up!

1094
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:04,659
- Lean, Jesse!
- Here comes Ridgeway! Give her the gun!

1095
01:27:06,259 --> 01:27:09,419
- We haven't crossed the finish line!
- I know it!

1096
01:27:09,499 --> 01:27:13,979
And the winner is Martin Ridgeway!

1097
01:27:14,059 --> 01:27:16,260
Stop this thing!
It's all over!

1098
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:19,660
I can't stop it!
It won't turn off!

1099
01:27:43,701 --> 01:27:46,181
Giddap!

1100
01:28:01,901 --> 01:28:03,861
Come on.

1101
01:28:15,342 --> 01:28:18,342
I'm glad I married you.

1102
01:28:20,661 --> 01:28:22,623
Giddap!

1103
01:28:26,781 --> 01:28:29,782
And this is the quit claim deed.

1104
01:28:29,862 --> 01:28:32,862
And if you'll just
sign all four copies.

1105
01:28:34,023 --> 01:28:36,903
Oh, now, Baxter,
don't take it so hard.

1106
01:28:36,982 --> 01:28:39,543
There are many businesses
you could do well in.

1107
01:28:39,623 --> 01:28:42,103
Have you thought
of insurance?

1108
01:28:42,183 --> 01:28:45,543
A lot.

1109
01:28:45,623 --> 01:28:49,863
Look, uh, Mr. Ridgeway, isn't there
some way I could get an extension on...

1110
01:28:49,943 --> 01:28:52,863
I feel as bad about this
as you, Baxter.

1111
01:28:52,943 --> 01:28:55,783
But look at it this way:
You're not losing a lodge.

1112
01:28:55,863 --> 01:29:00,503
- you're providing a home for wayward boys.
- Boys' home, my foot.

1113
01:29:00,583 --> 01:29:03,504
- Miss Wigginton.
- I don't care if you do fire me.

1114
01:29:03,584 --> 01:29:06,584
I can get a dollar an hour in Denver,
twice what you pay me.

1115
01:29:06,664 --> 01:29:10,944
He wants this place because
there are 3,000 acres of Douglas fir...

1116
01:29:11,064 --> 01:29:13,465
- that goes with it.
- There is?

1117
01:29:13,545 --> 01:29:16,623
Jacob Barnsworth deeded it
to the Ute Indians up in these hills.

1118
01:29:16,703 --> 01:29:18,623
It was to be theirs...

1119
01:29:18,703 --> 01:29:22,104
- as long as they occupied it.
- They didn't have to prove up or nothin'.

1120
01:29:22,184 --> 01:29:25,544
Wasn't like when he give the 200 acres
for the town of Silver Hill.

1121
01:29:25,624 --> 01:29:27,544
That was on condition
the town fathers...

1122
01:29:27,624 --> 01:29:29,945
kicked in with a library,
a church and two hospitals:

1123
01:29:30,024 --> 01:29:32,985
- one for folks and one for dumb animals.
- Anyway, the Utes...

1124
01:29:33,065 --> 01:29:36,224
have all left or died off,
so the timberland...

1125
01:29:36,304 --> 01:29:40,185
automatically reverts to the Jacob Barnsworth
estate, and that's you, Mr. Baxter.

1126
01:29:40,265 --> 01:29:43,304
So that's why
you wanted this place.

1127
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:46,344
You're gonna cut down
those woods back of town?

1128
01:29:46,424 --> 01:29:50,105
Let's stick to facts. You cannot meet
the payment, and it's due today.

1129
01:29:50,225 --> 01:29:53,706
- Dad?
- Not now, Richard. I know it's due today, but if I could just have a I...

1130
01:29:53,786 --> 01:29:56,985
There are no buts about it.
If you refuse to sign the quit claim...

1131
01:29:57,065 --> 01:29:59,985
you force me to start foreclosure
proceedings tomorrow morning.

1132
01:30:00,065 --> 01:30:02,946
- But, Dad!
- I told you once, Richard.

1133
01:30:04,506 --> 01:30:07,786
Did you want
to say something, young man?

1134
01:30:07,866 --> 01:30:10,105
Well, I didn't see
any library in town.

1135
01:30:10,185 --> 01:30:12,586
How come Silver Hill
don't revert back to you?

1136
01:30:12,706 --> 01:30:14,666
- Doesn't revert.
- Well, how come?

1137
01:30:16,985 --> 01:30:18,946
Yeah, how come?

1138
01:30:19,026 --> 01:30:21,266
I mean, why don't it
revert back to me?

1139
01:30:21,386 --> 01:30:23,586
It seems like
the same law would apply.

1140
01:30:23,666 --> 01:30:26,947
- Oh, that's ridiculous.
- There's nothing ridiculous about it.

1141
01:30:27,027 --> 01:30:29,546
If the deed restrictions
have been violated...

1142
01:30:29,626 --> 01:30:32,667
there's an automatic reversion
to the grantor, or his heirs.

1143
01:30:32,747 --> 01:30:36,307
You may just own the whole town
of Silver Hill, Mr. Baxter...

1144
01:30:36,387 --> 01:30:39,466
including his bank.

1145
01:30:45,067 --> 01:30:47,546
Ha, ha, ha.
Well, now, Johnny...

1146
01:30:47,626 --> 01:30:50,627
I see no reason why
we can't work this out.

1147
01:30:50,747 --> 01:30:54,868
You know, a ski lodge may be the best
thing that ever happened to Silver Hill.

1148
01:30:54,948 --> 01:30:58,147
Uh, what would you need
to put this place back into shape?

1149
01:30:58,227 --> 01:31:01,188
- Repairs? New furniture?
- First-class double chair lift.

1150
01:31:01,268 --> 01:31:03,868
Ahh, that's a good idea.

1151
01:31:03,948 --> 01:31:07,307
Well, why don't we have lunch
tomorrow, and we can talk it over?

1152
01:31:07,427 --> 01:31:09,828
Could I trouble you for a glass
of water and an aspirin?

1153
01:31:09,908 --> 01:31:12,587
Oh, sure, Mr. Ridgeway.
Come with me.

1154
01:31:13,828 --> 01:31:15,988
I beg your pardon.

1155
01:31:21,949 --> 01:31:24,748
Do we own the whole town
of Silver Hill, Dad?

1156
01:31:24,828 --> 01:31:27,549
I don't think Mr. Ridgeway
wants to find out.

1157
01:31:27,629 --> 01:31:29,589
Good work, son.

1158
01:31:31,269 --> 01:31:33,187
Mrs. Baxter?

1159
01:31:33,268 --> 01:31:36,069
I think we've got ourselves
a real ski lodge.

1160
01:31:36,149 --> 01:31:39,548
How'd you like
to ski down our mountain?

1161
01:31:39,628 --> 01:31:43,109
I'd follow you anywhere,
Mr. Baxter.

1162
01:31:45,269 --> 01:31:48,189
Ski down our mountain?

1163
01:31:48,269 --> 01:31:50,189
- Good. Good.
- Oh! Oh!

1164
01:31:50,269 --> 01:31:52,190
- Very good.
- Oh, Johnny.

1165
01:31:52,310 --> 01:31:54,270
- I'll never get the hang of it.
- Sure you will, Susie.

1166
01:31:54,350 --> 01:31:56,310
Look at the kids.

1167
01:31:57,869 --> 01:32:01,269
- Looks good!
- You two are doin' fine.

1168
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:03,309
Let's see you turn!

1169
01:32:04,629 --> 01:32:06,549
That a way to go,
Richard.

1170
01:32:06,629 --> 01:32:10,110
- Oh, I don't know.
- Susie. You may not believe this,

1171
01:32:10,190 --> 01:32:12,830
but I was no better than
you are when I first started.

1172
01:32:12,910 --> 01:32:15,110
- Yeah, it's really safe.
- And you know me, Mom.

1173
01:32:15,190 --> 01:32:17,830
You can't live on a ski slope
and not know how to ski.

1174
01:32:17,910 --> 01:32:21,630
I guarantee you I'll have you skiing
to the bottom of this hill in no time.

1175
01:32:25,510 --> 01:32:29,430
Even Stoutheart and Jesse
are getting into the spirit of things.

1176
01:32:29,509 --> 01:32:33,231
Come here, Stoutheart!
Come here, boy! Come on!

1177
01:32:33,351 --> 01:32:36,470
Come on! Attaboy!

1178
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:40,190
Come on. Come on.
Come on here, boy.

1179
01:32:40,270 --> 01:32:42,191
Attaboy, Stout.

1180
01:32:42,271 --> 01:32:44,351
Stout...heaaaarr...

1181
01:32:44,431 --> 01:32:46,911
- Dad!
- Johnny!

1182
01:32:46,991 --> 01:32:49,072
Oh, Johnny!

1183
01:32:49,152 --> 01:32:53,152
Aaahh! Oh!

1184
01:32:53,232 --> 01:32:55,152
- Johnny!
- Chris!

1185
01:32:55,232 --> 01:32:58,271
- Mom! Dad!
- Mr. Baxter, fall down!

1186
01:33:05,712 --> 01:33:07,632
Are you all right,
Johnny?

1187
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:09,752
I'm fine.

1188
01:33:09,832 --> 01:33:13,231
See, I told you I'd get you
to the bottom of the hill in no time.
