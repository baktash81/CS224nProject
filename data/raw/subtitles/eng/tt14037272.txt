I can't hear you.

Look at that, alright.

00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:25,432
Well,
then you got one goal here,

296
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:27,968
one singular focus.

297
00:24:28,068 --> 00:24:31,171
To get back to her
as soon as you can.

298
00:24:34,608 --> 00:24:39,446
You see, this prison is owned
by a corporation, right.

299
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:42,650
It's one in a long line of
privately-owned prisons,

300
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,952
it's a chain, alright.

301
00:24:45,052 --> 00:24:47,187
Just like Burger King
or McDonald's

302
00:24:47,288 --> 00:24:50,190
and I guess I'm like this
branch's CEO.

303
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:53,894
But I gotta be honest with you,
Terry, it's boring as shit.

305
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:58,532

No excitement in it.

310
00:25:07,074 --> 00:25:08,342
So I gotta make it interesting.

311
00:25:10,311 --> 00:25:13,947
So what I've done is,
I've created The Dungeon.

312
00:25:15,883 --> 00:25:16,784
The Dungeon?

313
00:25:16,884 --> 00:25:18,118
LUCAS:
Yeah, The Dungeon.

314
00:25:18,218 --> 00:25:20,421
And from what I heard about you,

315
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:23,023
you're pretty handy,

316
00:25:23,223 --> 00:25:24,024
you can handle yourself
in there,

317
00:25:24,124 --> 00:25:26,060
you'll have a good time.

318
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,929
It's a way to kill time
and to earn rewards.

319
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:30,964
What's in your wallet?

320
00:25:31,065 --> 00:25:32,099
That's another joke.

321
00:25:32,266 --> 00:25:33,967
It's alright,
you can laugh, soldier.

322
00:25:39,473 --> 00:25:42,142
Also, it's a good way for you
to get back to your daughter,

00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:45,579
Alright?

325
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,750
Now, what I need you to do is
meet your new roommate.

326
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,085
He's gonna prep you,

327

Where'd you learn to fight?

361
00:27:54,909 --> 00:27:57,611
My father was a Grand Master
up in Okla.

362
00:27:57,711 --> 00:28:01,816
So I grew up in his dojo
where he taught me how to fight,

physically and spiritually.

364
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:09,122

BONES: Well, you're inside
the system now, soldier.

00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,337

Yeah, I got shit on lock.

But if you can't keep your word,

National Veterans Affairs

00:45:14,114 --> 00:45:15,415
and I've been assigned
your case.

657
00:45:17,184 --> 00:45:19,921
You are
a highly-decorated soldier

658
00:45:20,822 --> 00:45:23,323

You're not a criminal.

00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:36,871
I graduated cum laude from
Howard University School of Law.

Yeah.

667
00:45:44,177 --> 00:45:47,347
There's been a lot of intel
coming out

668
00:45:47,447 --> 00:45:49,116
about too many
new private prisons

669
00:45:49,216 --> 00:45:51,785
and a lack of prisoners
to keep them filled.

670
00:45:51,886 --> 00:45:55,155
And some cities are so desperate
to keep these institutions open

671
00:45:55,255 --> 00:45:58,125
and the extra boost it gives
to the local job economy,

672
00:45:58,225 --> 00:46:00,494
they are creating a new system.

673

One of supply and demand
of live human bodies.

674
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:10,070
Mostly our people,
black and brown people.

675
00:46:12,606 --> 00:46:16,543
Mr. Savage,
I need you to stay strong, okay?

676
00:46:16,643 --> 00:46:18,712
We can fight this corrupt system
together.

677
00:46:18,813 --> 00:46:21,248
I just need you to trust me.

678
00:46:22,182 --> 00:46:23,617
I'm in here.

679
00:46:24,751 --> 00:46:27,922
They have physical custody
of my body.

680
00:46:28,022 --> 00:46:29,323
They own me.

681
00:46:30,424 --> 00:46:33,694
Therefore,
I must do what they say

682
00:46:34,661 --> 00:46:36,396

00:46:52,947 --> 00:46:56,216
I... I appreciate you, but um,

688
00:46:56,316 --> 00:46:58,619

on my own.

I hope you know that.

You can't fuck with me.

You know, the truth is

697
00:47:52,506 --> 00:47:54,741
you and Freeway
are a whole lot alike.

698
00:47:57,544 --> 00:47:59,513
I ain't got shit
to do with that man.

699
00:47:59,613 --> 00:48:00,882
Oh yeah, you do.

700
00:48:02,116 --> 00:48:03,017
Think about it.

701
00:48:03,151 --> 00:48:05,619
Both of y'all are ex-military.

702
00:48:06,753 --> 00:48:09,924
He spent most of his life
fightin' in the streets, too.

703
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:13,326
Truth is I tried to save him,

704
00:48:13,427 --> 00:48:15,796
but he refused
to let me help him.

705
00:48:15,897 --> 00:48:18,765
He was determined
to take the dark path.

706
00:48:20,868 --> 00:48:23,370
What makes you think
I ain't gonna go dark?

707
00:48:26,941 --> 00:48:29,143
You got your little girl.

708
00:48:29,242 --> 00:48:30,477
That gives you something
to live for,

709
00:48:30,577 --> 00:48:34,247
that's something
that Freeway never even had.

710
00:48:35,248 --> 00:48:38,685
So in that case,
you two are polar opposites.

711
00:48:38,785 --> 00:48:40,220

1093
01:12:40,895 --> 01:12:42,695
It's the American way.

1094
01:12:45,499 --> 01:12:46,766
Think about it.

1095
01:12:47,568 --> 01:12:48,735
All right.

1096
01:12:50,337 --> 01:12:52,306
Come on, come on.

1097
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:01,916
Why are you showin' me all this?

1098
01:13:02,016 --> 01:13:05,252
Because I want you
to be the first top dog

1099
01:13:05,352 --> 01:13:09,356

of your labor.

1100
01:13:09,456 --> 01:13:10,391
All right?

1101
01:13:10,491 --> 01:13:11,859
Why not?

1102
01:13:15,496 --> 01:13:16,230
You know why.

1103
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:17,898
Think about it.

1104
01:13:24,737 --> 01:13:25,606

I'm gonna think about it.

LUCAS: Yeah, there
you go. Just think about it.

1109
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,747
Ruminate on it.

1110
01:13:34,848 --> 01:13:35,748
Good job, fellas.

1111
01:13:35,849 --> 01:13:36,716

I want you to take a look

You wanted justice...

1121
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:55,402
All right, for the guard
that saved your life.

1122

Okay,

Yeah. I'm... I'm here for you.

1136
01:14:36,477 --> 01:14:38,245
- I am loyal.
- SAVAGE: Yeah.

1137
01:14:38,345 --> 01:14:39,480
This is loyalty.

Sorry, it uh, took me a minute
to respond to your last text,

1150
01:15:31,598 --> 01:15:34,702
but I... I figured it'd be better
if we all got together

1151
01:15:34,802 --> 01:15:36,337
and spoke in person.

1152
01:15:36,503 --> 01:15:39,740
LUCAS: Now I thought you said
he'd be willing to go all the way.

1153

Oh, he will be.

1154

my good friend,
the commissioner and myself...

1158
01:15:51,051 --> 01:15:52,453
Oh yeah, we're good friend.

1159
01:15:53,454 --> 01:15:55,789
We're gonna split
this whole thing 50-50,

1160
01:15:55,889 --> 01:15:56,990
all right?

1161
01:15:57,157 --> 01:15:58,625
And I wanted to cut you in
on the profit,

1162
01:15:58,726 --> 01:16:01,195
but you didn't want
any part of it.

1163
01:16:01,295 --> 01:16:03,697
Really too bad,
because it's quite profitable.

1164
01:16:03,797 --> 01:16:05,399
LUCAS:
Yeah.

1165
01:16:05,566 --> 01:16:07,101
COMMISSIONER: Especially, when
you add the gambling ring that we run

1166
01:16:07,201 --> 01:16:11,705
and seven other private prisons
in nearby counties,

1167
01:16:11,806 --> 01:16:14,575
pitting top dogs
against our top dog.

1168
01:16:14,675 --> 01:16:17,211
And you're our top dog now.

1169
01:16:17,311 --> 01:16:19,146
You work for us.

1170
01:16:19,246 --> 01:16:23,384
COMMISSIONER:
Hell, you exceeded expectations.

1171
01:16:23,484 --> 01:16:24,585
I even won the wager.

1172
01:16:24,685 --> 01:16:26,053
Oh, come on, really?
I thought you forgot about that.

1173
01:16:26,153 --> 01:16:27,588
- Come on, give it up.
- Uh, dammit.

1174
01:16:27,688 --> 01:16:28,789
Give it up.

1175
01:16:28,889 --> 01:16:30,491
Rub it in, huh, Harvey?

1176
01:16:32,559 --> 01:16:33,660
There we go.

1177
01:16:34,863 --> 01:16:38,499
Okay. I'm done... done with this.

1178
01:16:40,134 --> 01:16:42,169
Now I knew he'd go soft on us.

1179
01:16:42,269 --> 01:16:43,203
Uh-huh?

1180
01:16:43,337 --> 01:16:45,372
That's why I got a plan B
for your ass.

1181
01:16:45,472 --> 01:16:46,573
Well, how about that?

1182
01:16:46,673 --> 01:16:48,242
LUCAS:
Bring him in here.

1183
01:16:52,312 --> 01:16:53,514
No!

1184

Get 'em out of here,
both of 'em.

1191
01:17:08,429 --> 01:17:09,563
Stand up, soldier.

God, I hope so.

1197
01:17:17,504 --> 01:17:20,073
I'll call the warden

1439
01:29:33,941 --> 01:29:35,775
and to bring the corruption
in this facility

1440
01:29:35,876 --> 01:29:37,311
to their attention.

1441
01:29:38,479 --> 01:29:41,815
And I think you should know,
the commissioner,

1442
01:29:41,916 --> 01:29:43,384
he's in custody, too.

1443
01:29:44,451 --> 01:29:45,752
You see it's hard to regulate

1444
01:29:45,853 --> 01:29:48,088
these corporate
prison institutions.

1445
01:29:48,189 --> 01:29:50,624
We just have no control over
these private penitentiaries,

1446
01:29:50,723 --> 01:29:53,760
so your evidence pushes the case
for regulation.

1447
01:29:54,562 --> 01:29:55,695
I mean regardless

1448
01:29:55,896 --> 01:29:57,730
of what the men
inside these walls have done,

1449
01:29:58,432 --> 01:30:00,534
they're still human beings

1450
01:30:00,634 --> 01:30:03,037
and they deserve
to be treated as such.

1451
01:30:04,471 --> 01:30:07,441
The state has also agreed
to give you a full pardon.

1452
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:15,449
I... I coordinated
with the secretary's office

1453
01:30:15,549 --> 01:30:18,085
for you to be released today.

1454
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:27,928
Thank you.

1455
01:30:30,598 --> 01:30:31,832
The state has also agreed

1456
01:30:31,932 --> 01:30:34,935
to take care of your daughter's
medical costs.

1457
01:30:35,035 --> 01:30:38,038
I mean it's the least
they can do for you, right?

1458
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:46,981
Maybe.

1459
01:30:49,817 --> 01:30:51,852
Do you need a ride?

Yeah, I do.

1461
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:56,624
Just gotta say goodbye
to someone.

1462
01:30:56,724 --> 01:30:57,658
Sure.

I can't even say thank you

1467
01:31:17,444 --> 01:31:18,946
Gave you?

1468
01:31:20,247 --> 01:31:21,982
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't be goin' home

1469
01:31:22,082 --> 01:31:24,784
with my daughter right now.

1470
01:31:24,885 --> 01:31:28,055
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't care if I was alive.

1471
01:31:29,023 --> 01:31:31,458
That's what you gave me.

1472
01:31:31,558 --> 01:31:34,128
The will
to wanna be alive again.

1473
01:31:34,228 --> 01:31:36,397
Something that I can't
even say thank you for.

1474
01:31:37,598 --> 01:31:38,899
Just don't forget
about a brother

1475
01:31:38,999 --> 01:31:40,601
when you get to the outside,
you know?

1476
01:31:40,701 --> 01:31:42,802
Send somebody back for me.
