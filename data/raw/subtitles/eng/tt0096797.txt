00:00:54,084 --> 00:00:58,328
<b> "MALU VE AMANT". <!-- b--></b>

2
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,180
Hey dear!

3
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,060
Joelle...

4
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,940
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
I thought you were on the patio, painting as usual .

5
00:01:07,964 --> 00:01:09,209
No Frank...

6
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,500
I was trying to take advantage of this beautiful day.

7
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,300
I think of nature...

8
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,025
Everything around is so relaxing.

9
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,185
Also at noon.

10
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,180
Yes, there my dear! I
just wanted to get in.

11
00:01:23,215 --> 00:01:24,460
Darling...

12
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,380
Tomorrow, Charles will be released from prison.

13
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,020
Will he be released?

14
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,620
Many years ago?

15
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,260
Time moves fast sometimes.

16
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,660
Unfortunately for us it seemed to be flying...

17
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,260
But it wasn't the same for Charles.

18
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,180
And what did you do when you found out?

19
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,780
I was
the one who let them be released .

20
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,500
And come back here...

21
00:01:57,535 --> 00:01:58,780
What did you say

22
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,460
At least I could, Joelle.

23
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,420
Charles was in prison, with
no place to go.

24
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,540
Nobody accepted.

25
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,420
Wherever he goes...

26
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,420
I'm sure of that.

27
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,825
He
confirmed it in a letter I got from him .

28
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,740
He will be released for good
and will work here for us.

29
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,300
We
have to give him another chance .

30
00:02:28,335 --> 00:02:30,340
I hope you're right honey.

31
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,940
You have done a wonderful act of humanity.

32
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,980
I'm glad you understand me.

33
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,814
Honey, I had a really good idea.

34
00:02:41,815 --> 00:02:45,819
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
I thought our property was very nice and clean.

35
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,399
Charles
will give us a helping hand and we will succeed

36
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,659
producing a new wine variety.

37
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,160
A beautiful wine Our vineyards are
the best in the region.

38
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,900
It reminds me that I left you for a long time,
my dear.

39
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,100
You're beautiful

40
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,580
This whole area is gorgeous.

41
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,380
I want to go for a walk to the village.

42
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,020
Rest dear, see you later.

43
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:27,300
Ciao, dear...

44
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,300
<i>Charles...</i>

45
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,020
<i>You will come back here tomorrow.</i>

46
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,660
<i>Charles...</i>

47
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,060
<i>The idea of ​​rebuilding makes me happy.</i>

48
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,460
<i>But I never
mastered the desire to hold you in my arms ,</i>

49
00:04:08,484 --> 00:04:10,017
<i>even just once.</i>

50
00:04:10,052 --> 00:04:12,420
<i>You will no longer leave me.</i>

51
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,860
<i>See you again tomorrow</i>

52
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,500
<i>And this thing is absolutely,</i>

53
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,460
<i>I don't know why it gave me so much emotion.</i>

54
00:04:24,495 --> 00:04:26,420
<i>I feel like a mare...</i>

55
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,220
<i>with ankle and mixed.</i>

56
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,340
<i>And who wants to escape from the sky,</i>

57
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,140
<i>And feel free again.</i>

58
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,100
<i>There is a caring lover.</i>

59
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,140
<i>Also violence...</i>

60
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,820
<i>Did you do anything for me?</i>

61
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,060
<i>And the
sad memory of what happened next .</i>

62
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:59,420
<i>I wish you were a bad dream.</i>

63
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,660
<i>A nightmare...</i>

64
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,540
<i>In a dark night and without a moon.</i>

65
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,820
<i>You always miss me.</i>

66
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,460
<i>I've been thinking of you for all these years.</i>

67
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,180
<i>And to your letters.</i>

68
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,545
<i>Like some expressions of love.</i>

69
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,660
<i>But
they made me enjoy it more than you can imagine .</i>

70
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,100
<i>Frank
never knew he wrote them .</i>

71
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,940
<i>And I felt the taste of jealousy.</i>

72
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,580
<i>You were my only true friend</i>

73
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,780
<i>And I've never felt so alone.</i>

74
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,660
<i>I have read them so many times that I
almost learned about them from the outside.</i>

75
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,180
<i>And now that you're back again,
I'm a little disappointed.</i>

76
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,100
<i>You will no longer write to me.</i>

77
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,540
<i>How many times have I read and reread</i>

78
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,180
<i>these expressions,</i>

79
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,940
<i>And your words</i>

80
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:05,220
<i>very common</i>

81
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,060
<i>and simple</i>

82
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,540
<i>but all are more convenient.</i>

83
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,105
<i>Let me remember all these moments</i>

84
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,260
<i>And feelings I've never felt</i>

85
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,380
<i>for a long time</i>

86
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,460
<i>And I never forgot.</i>

87
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,740
<i>Charles...</i>

88
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:32,500
<i>I was
lost somewhere when you were with me</i>

89
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,140
<i>While you hold me in your arms</i>

90
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,860
<i>And
we completely abandon our love .</i>

91
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,220
Things are going better for me.
I recovered after the accident.

92
00:10:49,255 --> 00:10:51,140
I'm glad to hear that.

93
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,540
And lady, how does she feel?

94
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,900
Okay okay...

95
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,820
Even if he's alone with me.
Like the flower of the desert.

96
00:11:04,855 --> 00:11:07,937
He is young,
full of enthusiasm and meticulousness.

97
00:11:07,972 --> 00:11:11,020
He
needs fun and entertainment .

98
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,900
The countryside
doesn't have much to offer .

99
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,940
For me,
it is an ideal place to live and work in silence .

100
00:11:19,975 --> 00:11:22,220
But for him it's
like living in exile.

101
00:11:22,255 --> 00:11:23,540
Oh, finally!

102
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,540
Come on dear...

103
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,980
Come to greet Charles.

104
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,340
You'll see that she'll be happy to be back.

105
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,620
It gives him great pleasure.

106
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,780
Hello woman!

107
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,060
Hello Charles!

108
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,900
I am happy to see you again

109
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:53,860
And
I'm happy to be able to work for you again .

110
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,500
Dear, take Charles to the barn.

111
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,220
It is
true that I am in a rather unstable situation.

112
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,500
Yes sweetheart

113
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:08,660
You, Charles, always
kept them perfect.

114
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,540
I'm just waiting to be able to do this again.

115
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,665
Sir, aren't you coming with us?

116
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,380
No, I'm busy, I can't.
I have to keep working on my book .

117
00:12:21,415 --> 00:12:24,820
But you can go together.
Go with him, Joelle.

118
00:12:24,855 --> 00:12:26,220
We'll see you late.

119
00:12:26,255 --> 00:12:27,540
Soon...

120
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,620
Nothing seems to have changed here.

121
00:12:39,655 --> 00:12:41,300
No, they haven't changed...

122
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,340
They were the same as you left them.

123
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,100
It's been a long time.

124
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,820
And you are
as beautiful as ever .

125
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,180
You have not changed at all.

126
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:04,740
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
Do you know how much I've thought about you all these years ?

127
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,460
Take care of yourselves!

128
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,060
How warm are your hands!

129
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,340
I wish you

130
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,660
Let...

131
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,340
I can't go through this again.

132
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,620
Please...

133
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,260
since you left

134
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,380
I got very close to my mistress.

135
00:13:38,415 --> 00:13:40,717
You can't understand how I feel.

136
00:13:40,752 --> 00:13:42,985
How important is it to me?

137
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,820
Try to understand me.
He did everything for me.

138
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,940
To have a happy life.

139
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,460
And I've been waiting for this moment.

140
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,260
But now...

141
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,940
I'm afraid!

142
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,900
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
How do I want to get rid of this suffocating opposition ?</i>

143
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,540
<i>That's what told me, no...</i>

144
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,940
<i>Do not do this!</i>

145
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,740
<i>I was happy then.</i>

146
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,780
<i>Reluctant to see what will happen.</i>

147
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,420
<i>Each of your moves</i>

148
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,740
<i>Even the simplest</i>

149
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,660
<i>I was having fun</i>

150
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,660
<i>And I was excited...</i>

151
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,020
<i>"She
loves me, she doesn't love me" while playing</i>

152
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,220
<i>And you covered me with flower petals.</i>

153
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,900
<i>Sometimes you made me scream</i>

154
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,340
<i>It forces me to discover new emotions.</i>

155
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,820
<i>And finally the
sentimentality overwhelming me .</i>

156
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,500
<i>You were the best play partner.</i>

157
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,580
<i>And the guilt that exists between us,</i>

158
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,780
<i>It was great!</i>

159
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,540
<i>I felt happy</i>

160
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,900
<i>And with enthusiasm</i>

161
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,380
<i>in all our meetings...</i>

162
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,380
I look at you and
remember everything that happened here .

163
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,260
You have not changed at all.

164
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,780
You are all the same.

165
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,980
You haven't changed.

166
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:23,180
You have become more beautiful, you
are a real woman.

167
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,740
You can't imagine how much I want you.

168
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:31,660
You
don't know how long I've been waiting for this moment .

169
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,940
I can't believe I touched you again.

170
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,980
I love you Joelle!

171
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,740
And I
want to make love to you as always .

172
00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:45,580
I want you to be alone.

173
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,540
Don't think anything.

174
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,940
I want you to feel angry

175
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,820
how do you leave

176
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,900
no doubt

177
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,460
I am here now

178
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,380
Leave yourself in the arms of love.

179
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,980
Your boobs are so strong

180
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,020
and countries

181
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,980
Like the pearls he puts in his throat.

182
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,900
Let me feel...

183
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,500
Yeah that's it!

184
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,500
Only...

185
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,740
Come back my love...

186
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,780
Then...

187
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,420
I want to kiss you all over

188
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,260
Yeah...

189
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,260
Oh yes, how beautiful you are!

190
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,820
Time to go...

191
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,385
Hello Charles!

192
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,220
Hello Mr Conte!

193
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,740
So how's the deal going? Are you doing

194
00:20:46,775 --> 00:20:48,020
Yes, no problem.

195
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,500
Thank you...

196
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,260
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
Did you see how much damage the snow did last year ?

197
00:20:56,295 --> 00:20:57,540
Yes I saw

198
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,380
But
I think like the whole valley covered in snow

199
00:21:02,415 --> 00:21:04,657
you must be very beautiful

200
00:21:04,692 --> 00:21:06,865
I really like sitting outside.

201
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,460
When I was in prison, I
didn't get enough air.

202
00:21:09,495 --> 00:21:10,575
I was out of my mind.

203
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:12,879
I suffered from the park, I am the dog.

204
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,980
Here in the stables
things were still the same.

205
00:21:16,015 --> 00:21:18,340
Nobody took care of them.

206
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:24,060
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
I saw the roofs of the roof grow.

207
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,500
There are some cracks here.

208
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,780
So how did Miss Joelle look?

209
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,380
You can't come here! What were you doing

210
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,305
I wanted to find the lady.

211
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,740
The lady doesn't come back before noon.
He went to the village.

212
00:22:36,775 --> 00:22:38,460
Ah, he went to the village.

213
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,140
But why did you follow me?
Why are you spying on me?

214
00:22:44,164 --> 00:22:45,305
Why?

215
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:48,020
I'm not spying on you, why would I do that?

216
00:22:48,055 --> 00:22:49,300
I do not know...

217
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,900
But I think you know very well.

218
00:22:51,935 --> 00:22:53,180
What do you want to say?

219
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,540
You're beautiful

220
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:02,060
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
Does he like to wear a lady's clothes once in a while ?

221
00:23:02,095 --> 00:23:03,340
What do you want to say?

222
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,460
Take off those clothes!

223
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,220
And she tries on the lady's dress instead.

224
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,540
I'm sure it will be very good.

225
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,500
Now I want you to look in the mirror.

226
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,860
Put a hand on your hip...

227
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,820
Stay, don't move!

228
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,660
I do not know why

229
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,380
but
there is no life in my pictures .

230
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:46,769
Something missing.

231
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,940
Try to laugh...

232
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,820
Now damn it!

233
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,500
Really?

234
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,420
Yeah!

235
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,260
You will become the "Mona Lisa".

236
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,900
He was such a bad man!

237
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,340
Hello there...

238
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,420
Hello ladies!

239
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,060
Have a nice day!

240
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,860
I think there
is something missing from this table .

241
00:27:30,895 --> 00:27:32,140
Does not appear mu

242
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,100
The park is devoid of life.

243
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,540
What do you think

244
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,060
Yeah...

245
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,460
He seems devoid of emotions.

246
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,620
He may need love.

247
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,660
When women are borrowed, their
lips turn red,

248
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,540
and her breasts,

249
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,580
more voluminous

250
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,580
And all the intimate parts

251
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,700
become more colorful

252
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,340
lively...

253
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,620
Come on! I'm out of here.

254
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,340
You were here honey!

255
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,740
Did you have a nice day?

256
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,940
How does this work, little "Raphael"?

257
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,225
I was
n't very inspired by the pattern I had.

258
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:30,380
But Charles gave me
some suggestions that proved to be very appropriate .

259
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,180
Did you notice anything strange about him?

260
00:29:33,215 --> 00:29:34,460
No, I don't think so...

261
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,745
why are you asking me

262
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:42,180
Charles
said a certain claustrophobia is in jail.

263
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:45,780
He
must have suffered a lot, always trapped in the cell .

264
00:29:45,815 --> 00:29:48,620
not to see anyone. without a woman...

265
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,180
Has it made any progress?

266
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,020
No, not at all.

267
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,420
No progress.

268
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,060
why are you asking me

269
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,380
Honey, are you jealous?

270
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,060
It was a joke.

271
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,660
Really? It doesn't appear to me.

272
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,660
Talking about Charles is enough for me.

273
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,780
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
Do you remember our life before the accident ?

274
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:20,100
Sometimes
you think you sacrificed everything for me .

275
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,860
No...

276
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,980
I don't want you to say that.

277
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,220
I love you...

278
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,060
Nobody forces me to stay here with you.

279
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:36,580
My love for you is my
reason for living.

280
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,545
Now I leave you with your reading.

281
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:49,620
I'm a little tired
. I think I'll have a good rest.

282
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,220
Go my love.

283
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,780
Goodbye My dear...

284
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,225
Charles...

285
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,185
Charles, have you been waiting for me for a long time?

286
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,940
I've been waiting for you all night.
I wish you much

287
00:31:57,975 --> 00:32:00,220
Wait, beat the buff!

288
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,380
Let's make love slowly as I love.

289
00:32:02,415 --> 00:32:04,500
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
I wanted to call you if he saw that you weren't coming .

290
00:32:04,535 --> 00:32:06,980
You're crazy! What is in your mind?

291
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,940
You're even more beautiful tonight.

292
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,100
There is a kind of special light in his eyes.

293
00:32:18,135 --> 00:32:19,380
Ah, Charles!

294
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,260
<i>You're sensitive to the
way you touch me .</i>

295
00:33:40,295 --> 00:33:42,700
<i>You make me feel so wet.</i>

296
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,660
<i>How you touched me that no one else did.</i>

297
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,220
Hello woman!

298
00:35:55,255 --> 00:35:56,500
Hello there...

299
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,940
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
Did you see how happy the countess lady looked?

300
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,380
Have a nice day!

301
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,820
Hello there...

302
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,500
I see you're back at work.

303
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,620
Don't tell me you're jealous now.

304
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,840
Have a nice day!

305
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:50,105
Hello there...

306
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,140
Prepare me now.

307
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,580
Of course I do.

308
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,620
Dear, I must go to the village.

309
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,460
Ok darling.

310
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,100
What do you need

311
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,745
I wanted to ride a shark.

312
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,900
Then I will go shopping.

313
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,620
I think I'll be gone all morning.

314
00:40:17,655 --> 00:40:20,220
I'm glad you had so much fun.

315
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,340
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
I will do my best to return before lunch .

316
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,740
Soon...

317
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,820
Please lady.

318
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,860
Two ladies and both are beautiful

319
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,940
And what a wonderful temperament!

320
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,780
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
Can you order some in the wine cellar ?

321
00:41:04,815 --> 00:41:06,060
Yes, definitely!

322
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,705
I will do this tomorrow.

323
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,740
As we speak,
most of the vehicles have disappeared.

324
00:41:09,775 --> 00:41:11,420
I noticed that too.

325
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,220
We'll get some.

326
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:20,020
The fork there is
all that remains of the tragedy .

327
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,540
Dora?

328
00:41:28,575 --> 00:41:29,700
Yes, Lady

329
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,700
What do you want

330
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,460
Prepare me a tea.

331
00:41:33,495 --> 00:41:34,980
Okay ma'am, now.

332
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,060
Where are you running from?

333
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,860
- Come here! - No... it's over!

334
00:41:41,895 --> 00:41:43,545
What if the lady returns?

335
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,300
- What about the lady?
- No not now!

336
00:41:45,324 --> 00:41:46,609
Ah...

337
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,580
Dora, is the tea ready?

338
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,180
Yes, right now lady!

339
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,340
Where is this tea?

340
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,620
Come on, open it! I'm not in the mood...

341
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,820
Open the door.

342
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,540
Hungry...

343
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,860
Please!

344
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,300
Hungry...

345
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,020
I can not breathe!

346
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:00,900
Please...

347
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,740
What are you doing

348
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,900
Open the door!

349
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:40,300
<i>You had a good time in the morning, didn't you?</i>

350
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,980
<i>But my legs?</i>

351
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,660
<i>Maybe he doesn't like it anymore.</i>

352
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:58,900
Ah...

353
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,820
<i>Maybe she likes the maid
more?</i>

354
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,180
<i>What do you think of my ass?</i>

355
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,220
<i>Isn't this beautiful?</i>

356
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,100
<i>Look carefully at this!</i>

357
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:36,020
<i>He likes looking at her, doesn't he?</i>

358
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,220
Ah...

359
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,740
<i>Why don't they like it?</i>

360
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,460
Why did you do this?

361
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,100
Why did you do

362
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:50,420
Tell me!

363
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,820
I wanted you to suffer.

364
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:56,500
You are so sorry for me.

365
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:59,860
You thought you could do whatever you wanted with me.

366
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,020
But...

367
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,380
In a relationship like ours...

368
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:07,680
It shouldn't be revenge.

369
00:48:07,715 --> 00:48:10,220
If you want to love me without consequences,

370
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,540
You have to admit what they've done.

371
00:48:12,575 --> 00:48:14,820
without any anger.

372
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,020
And leave yourself

373
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,860
Any fantasy.

374
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,380
I
really hate you when I hear you say that.

375
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:28,140
In the name of love
you have to go through all this jealousy .

376
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,900
I didn't betray you to make you suffer.

377
00:48:33,935 --> 00:48:35,340
because I love you

378
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:39,140
And
you love me more than women in the world .

379
00:48:39,175 --> 00:48:40,700
But I can't have you

380
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,420
I did this for what I did.

381
00:48:43,455 --> 00:48:45,140
I did it for you!

382
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:12,105
Have a nice day.

383
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:13,460
Hello dear.

384
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:21,700
What a beautiful flower you have dear!

385
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:23,820
This is very good.

386
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:25,860
Ah, Frank...

387
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:28,020
The perfume of flowers burns me.

388
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,340
You are more beautiful than all roses.

389
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:37,540
It
was my great pleasure to wake up and find a room full of flowers .

390
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:44,380
Thanks, it was
like waking up in a gorgeous garden.

391
00:50:44,415 --> 00:50:47,060
Actually, it was me who did it.

392
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:55,500
I cut the roses and
thought it would be good to take them to your room .

393
00:50:55,535 --> 00:50:58,657
I
admit it was an excellent idea , Charles.

394
00:50:58,692 --> 00:51:01,780
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
Anything to make my wife happy .

395
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:06,780
And her happiness makes me happy too.

396
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:10,580
You started your job early this morning.

397
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:15,940
Why did you come to have a cup of
coffee with us ?

398
00:51:15,975 --> 00:51:17,220
Come on, sit down.

399
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,340
Come on, what are you waiting for?

400
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:30,905
Bay Count ...

401
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:33,500
Come quickly, the doctor is here.

402
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:37,220
Excuse me, the hopeful
man has arrived.

403
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:42,020
He's a good friend and
I can't let him wait.

404
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:46,740
Soon...

405
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:50,900
Ciao, dear.

406
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:01,820
He has a lot of courage.

407
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:05,540
all that happened
, taking into account things.

408
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,380
You have given me a very pleasant surprise.

409
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:25,540
Really!

410
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:30,420
And that made me the greatest pleasure.

411
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:37,700
Joelle...

412
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:42,180
Will you come to see me tonight?

413
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:44,340
Yeah!

414
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,660
Honey, how are you feeling?

415
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,020
What did the doctor say?

416
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,625
What did you expect me to say?

417
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:05,700
Just what he usually says.

418
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:09,180
Honey, you don't have to think.

419
00:53:09,215 --> 00:53:10,500
For my own good.

420
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:16,660
I have no reason to live without you.

421
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,860
I adore you Joelle.

422
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:25,300
<i>Of course this time was different...</i>

423
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,780
<i>Yes sweetheart...</i>

424
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:53,825
<i>Help me undress myself.</i>

425
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:55,700
<i>And then come on me.</i>

426
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,660
<i>I really like doing this.</i>

427
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,220
I love you very much

428
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:12,580
I love you dear

429
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:14,980
And me...

430
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:10,260
Come in!

431
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,500
I am waiting you...

432
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:43,100
you are here now

433
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:48,100
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
I want to feel all these pleasures .

434
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:52,580
which I promised them.

435
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:56,580
Stay here!

436
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:59,140
And you start to undress.

437
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:02,260
You just know how to do it.

438
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:34,500
No problem...

439
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:39,620
Come here...

440
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:42,660
Come and stretch these pillows!

441
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:04,340
This is good.

442
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:15,300
Now close your eyes.

443
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:19,300
And don't promise me don't look at me

444
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:01,060
No...

445
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:03,740
Please stop!

446
01:09:03,775 --> 01:09:05,060
Let me go.

447
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:06,580
No...

448
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:16,740
Ah!

449
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:18,500
Its...

450
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:20,780
Something terrible happened there!

451
01:09:20,815 --> 01:09:22,100
Come on!

452
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:26,420
No...

453
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:28,380
My love, stop it!

454
01:10:28,415 --> 01:10:29,700
No!

455
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:31,460
Help! Help!

456
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:49,020
Wait, this show is for you.

457
01:10:49,055 --> 01:10:50,540
I summoned them to come here.

458
01:10:50,575 --> 01:10:51,860
Look!

459
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:55,420
did you like it?

460
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:58,620
Take care of your face.

461
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:00,620
What do you think it feels?

462
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:02,680
Pain?

463
01:11:02,715 --> 01:11:03,867
Pleasant?

464
01:11:03,902 --> 01:11:05,001
What is this?

465
01:11:05,036 --> 01:11:06,065
I do not know

466
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:08,740
Pleasure or pain is the same thing.

467
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:12,345
When you two feel together

468
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:15,220
You cannot separate them.

469
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:17,220
Because your body

470
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:19,500
overwhelmed by all the emotions

471
01:11:19,535 --> 01:11:21,180
he can feel.

472
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:24,100
And now I want to see you

473
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:26,460
instead of.

474
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:28,100
Come on! I got them all for me.

475
01:11:28,124 --> 01:11:29,649
I'm out of here.

476
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:34,460
You can't go now

477
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:37,860
You have to wait for the end of the game.

478
01:11:37,895 --> 01:11:39,140
No!

479
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:40,900
You're wrong

480
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:43,700
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
I don't want to respect the rules of your game .

481
01:11:43,735 --> 01:11:45,780
What do you really want from me?

482
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:49,460
I want you to know the possible pleasures.

483
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:52,940
All the emotions you can feel.

484
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:57,980
Where are you going

485
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:01,900
You can't escape what you feel.

486
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:11,940
Come on!

487
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:10,740
Charles!

488
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:12,460
Frank!

489
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:51,560
Ah!

490
01:13:51,595 --> 01:13:53,545
No! Help!

491
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:54,900
Leave me alone!

492
01:13:54,940 --> 01:13:56,240
Help!

493
01:13:56,275 --> 01:13:57,540
Help!

494
01:13:57,820 --> 01:13:59,140
No!

495
01:13:59,175 --> 01:14:00,460
No...

496
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,780
No bitch!

497
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:03,380
What do you want from me

498
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:05,500
Let me go dear!

499
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,180
No!

500
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:09,500
Come on!

501
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:11,540
No!

502
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:13,700
No...

503
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:15,500
Leave me alone!

504
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:17,700
what are you doing to me

505
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:26,740
Come on!

506
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:33,420
I finally
saw her unleash her animal instinct .

507
01:15:33,455 --> 01:15:34,740
Get the hell out of here!

508
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:36,660
These are
nothing but perversions .

509
01:15:36,695 --> 01:15:38,260
I don't want to satisfy my whims!

510
01:15:38,295 --> 01:15:40,145
- No perversion. - Yeah...

511
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:43,260
Only with me
can you satisfy the instincts you suppressed with your miracle .

512
01:15:43,284 --> 01:15:45,249
Shut up! Did you get it

513
01:15:45,516 --> 01:15:46,516
Yeah...

514
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:48,500
You're right, get out of here.

515
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:51,500
We have nothing to say to each other.

516
01:15:51,535 --> 01:15:54,220
I had nothing to say before.

517
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:02,460
Hello dear.

518
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:04,460
Have a nice day.

519
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:10,780
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
I took a long walk in the woods this morning .

520
01:16:10,815 --> 01:16:12,100
Nevertheless?

521
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:13,860
Look what I found.

522
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:18,260
But dear...

523
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:19,580
Do not say anything!

524
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:22,680
You don't have to confirm me to me.

525
01:16:22,715 --> 01:16:25,420
The game is fine if it doesn't take too long.

526
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:28,860
And even more beautiful

527
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:32,180
if it doesn't cause anyone pain.

528
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:34,740
What are you trying to tell me?

529
01:16:34,775 --> 01:16:36,020
What does it mean?

530
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:37,300
What are you talking about

531
01:16:37,335 --> 01:16:38,517
I do not understand

532
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:39,700
No dear.

533
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:42,100
Charles exaggerated this time.

534
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:47,800
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
I didn't think he was capable of such cruelty .

535
01:16:47,835 --> 01:16:50,700
But this time his betrayal
devastated me.

536
01:16:50,735 --> 01:16:52,300
It's time to end all this.

537
01:16:52,335 --> 01:16:53,980
Did you know everything then?

538
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:55,460
You always knew that...

539
01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:57,460
You knew everything...

540
01:16:57,980 --> 01:17:01,420
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
I can't stand my wife getting involved

541
01:17:01,455 --> 01:17:03,540
in such immoral games.

542
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:04,980
Isn't that true, dear?

543
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:10,140
This is an unbearable situation.

544
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:11,905
I don't know how to get rid of this.

545
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:15,380
That's why I
decided to get him out of here .

546
