1
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:17,912
Sir! This is Jui Nagar area in Mumbai.

2
00:07:17,936 --> 00:07:19,535
This area is in the
processing of developing.

3
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:21,524
Just like Chennai Thampuram

4
00:07:21,756 --> 00:07:23,800
Why are you looking
at the bathroom, sir?

5
00:07:25,824 --> 00:07:29,192
There, sir. That is kitchen.
You can use this as dining hall.

6
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:30,529
But there is no table here.

7
00:07:31,442 --> 00:07:34,406
Sir! Ten thousand rent
and one lakh advance.

8
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,287
This is window, sir. If you open it..

9
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:40,190
..you will get a lot of air.

10
00:07:40,214 --> 00:07:42,223
If you open it during day,
people might also blown away.

11
00:07:42,247 --> 00:07:43,317
If you open it during night..

12
00:07:44,396 --> 00:07:46,403
..even the furniture will
be blown away with people.

13
00:07:46,771 --> 00:07:48,715
I forgot to tell you.
Did you see that water tank?

14
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:53,087
Amitabh Bachan's house is next to it. That
tall cinema actor.. 'Kaun banega Karodpati'

15
00:07:53,111 --> 00:07:55,903
It's alright.
But what colour shirt are you wearing?

16
00:07:56,328 --> 00:07:57,722
What was the colour that
you told me that you'll be wearing?

17
00:07:57,746 --> 00:07:59,105
Is this meroon colour?

18
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:00,918
Now I don't have
that colour shirt, sir?

19
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,988
Some fellow has stolen it last night.

20
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:07,965
There are many thieves here, sir.

21
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,340
Thank you!

22
00:08:26,311 --> 00:08:28,872
Excuse me! I am Karthik from Vizag.

23
00:08:28,998 --> 00:08:29,994
Nice meeting you, sir.

24
00:08:30,144 --> 00:08:32,387
Go straight and turn left.
That's your cabin. - Thank you.

25
00:08:44,184 --> 00:08:45,274
How long are you going to take, sir?

26
00:08:45,298 --> 00:08:46,853
You are getting late for the office.
Hurry up.

27
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,168
My mom and dad are coming.
I'll take two liters milk extra.

28
00:08:51,192 --> 00:08:53,173
I told the watchman.
I hope he doesn't forget.

29
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,905
He is a fool, sir. - Why is that?

30
00:08:56,134 --> 00:08:58,614
He irritates me saying good
morning whever I go out or come in.

31
00:08:58,331 --> 00:08:59,439
That is why I slapped him.

32
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:04,393
Why did you slap him for saying good morning? He turns left and say
good morning if I am right side.. ..and turns right if I am left.

33
00:09:04,518 --> 00:09:05,918
May be his eye sight is not proper.

34
00:09:03,598 --> 00:09:05,730
I took him to eye
specialist thinking that.

35
00:09:05,809 --> 00:09:07,257
I hope you too would have
visited the doctor. - Yes.

36
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,812
There will be a big board there.
- Yes, I know.

37
00:09:08,836 --> 00:09:10,978
Doctor showed him a small letter
on it and asked him to recognize it.

38
00:09:11,002 --> 00:09:12,002
He said he don't know.

39
00:09:12,336 --> 00:09:15,462
Doctor showed him a big letter
but he gave the same answer.

40
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:18,727
Doctor showed him the biggest letter 'A' and
asked him to recognize it. He said he cannot.

41
00:09:18,998 --> 00:09:21,337
Then the doctor was irritated
and asked 'do you know who I am?'.

42
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:22,385
You are a doctor, he said.

43
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:28,884
Then why didn't he recognize letters?
He was illitrate. So he couldn't read.

44
00:09:30,963 --> 00:09:34,857
forget about him. When will your
parents come? - Tomorrow. Okay.

45
00:09:35,881 --> 00:09:37,942
Sir! Where are your
legs, sir? - Oh!

46
00:09:38,982 --> 00:09:41,083
Sorry! I thought you kept
a big ashtray for me.

47
00:09:41,107 --> 00:09:42,713
It's alright. I will
throw it outside.

48
00:09:47,189 --> 00:09:49,583
Buildings in our village
will be in sleeping position..

49
00:09:49,661 --> 00:09:51,276
..and here they stand high. That's it.

50
00:09:59,264 --> 00:10:01,269
Water is sweet, okay for drinking.

51
00:10:01,332 --> 00:10:02,939
Kitchen is big too.

52
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:06,429
You are not the one
who will cook anyway.

53
00:10:07,452 --> 00:10:08,436
Why is that?

54
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,616
If you are in the
kitchen for two days..

55
00:10:10,464 --> 00:10:12,700
..you will fall sick for the next two
days What is the need for all that?

56
00:10:12,724 --> 00:10:15,984
You have arthritis problem.
He is talking about it.

57
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,127
We should find a medicine
for your problem first.

58
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:22,612
You are asking me not to cook. Then
how are we going to eat food then?

59
00:10:23,072 --> 00:10:25,332
I have arranged for food.
There is a mess nearby.

60
00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:26,706
Mess?! This is Mumbai.

61
00:10:27,444 --> 00:10:29,594
My jaws will pain if I eat chapati.

62
00:10:29,673 --> 00:10:30,656
Can't we get rice?

63
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:32,081
Mess belongs to our state people.

64
00:10:32,105 --> 00:10:34,193
Give this address to
the people you want to give.

65
00:10:34,471 --> 00:10:35,646
I wrote to Ajay.

66
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,393
Give me the address. I will note down.

67
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:39,565
Don't worry, dad.

68
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:41,609
Give me. - Bye!

69
00:10:41,745 --> 00:10:43,634
See you, mom.
I will be back soon in the evening.

70
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:47,593
Very good! Your leg and your wish.
Do whatever you like.

71
00:10:47,672 --> 00:10:49,611
My leg is paining
because of train journey.

72
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,944
That is why I kept it like this. If anyone see
you, they think that you are about to kick me.

73
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,402
Keep both the legs up.

74
00:10:55,481 --> 00:10:57,416
Don't open the door without
asking if anyone rings the bell.

75
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:59,378
Dad! Don't leave mom alone and go.

76
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:01,620
Hey, you go to the office.

77
00:11:01,781 --> 00:11:04,161
I am looking after her for 45 years.
Don't I know that?

78
00:11:04,977 --> 00:11:06,001
Bread is in the fridge.

79
00:11:08,025 --> 00:11:10,417
And the carriage
will come at 12 o'clock.

80
00:12:14,862 --> 00:12:18,413
If he gets married,
we won't need to get food from the Hotel.

81
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,440
We asked him many times.

82
00:12:22,464 --> 00:12:23,883
We cannot force him.

83
00:12:34,813 --> 00:12:38,579
Victory to nurses strike!

84
00:12:38,603 --> 00:12:41,936
Victory to nurses strike!

85
00:12:42,014 --> 00:12:44,383
Hello, sisters! No matter
how much you shout, there is no use.

86
00:12:44,407 --> 00:12:46,396
Victory to nurses strike!

87
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:48,224
We fought a lot for this.

88
00:12:48,303 --> 00:12:49,349
Victory to nurses strike!

89
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,429
What did this society do for us?
We want justice.

90
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:55,997
Victory to nurses strike!

91
00:12:56,694 --> 00:13:00,322
Victory to nurses strike!

92
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:05,700
Victory to nurses strike!

93
00:13:29,185 --> 00:13:30,195
Thank you!

94
00:13:37,061 --> 00:13:40,672
Sir! I wanted to open a bank account.
Why did you bring me to ladies college?

95
00:13:41,751 --> 00:13:45,073
Banks can have counters
in women's colleges too.

96
00:13:46,281 --> 00:13:53,540
Shouldn't we open an account there? We will deposit
and withdraw our money. Moreover it is colourful!

97
00:13:53,564 --> 00:13:58,155
Sir! We get interest for the amount we deposit in every bank.
But here depositing money is interesting. Come with me.

98
00:13:58,179 --> 00:14:02,925
There won't be any male employee in this bank,
sir. Everyone is ladies. Saris and dresses.

99
00:14:03,205 --> 00:14:05,994
Ladies are very innocent.

100
00:14:06,018 --> 00:14:06,866
Why is that?

101
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:09,313
Look at their faces.

102
00:14:09,337 --> 00:14:10,106
I am asking why do you think so.

103
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:13,035
If they wear saris,
we can look at their waists.

104
00:14:13,173 --> 00:14:14,807
If they wear churidars
we can look at their faces.

105
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,195
If they wear midis,
we can look at their legs.

106
00:14:16,218 --> 00:14:17,126
Where do you look if they wear shirt?

107
00:14:17,037 --> 00:14:18,460
Then we can look at their pockets.

108
00:14:18,707 --> 00:14:24,106
Stop talking nonsense. - This is nothing, sir. Sir,
this is Mumbai! You will see how girls here are.

109
00:14:24,344 --> 00:14:26,671
Some of men have a bad habit.
Do you know what it is?

110
00:14:27,411 --> 00:14:28,413
Is that so? What is it?

111
00:14:27,928 --> 00:14:29,148
They leer at other men's wives.

112
00:14:29,863 --> 00:14:32,185
If another man leers at his own wife,
he gets uncomfortable.

113
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:35,011
You are talking about me.
I can understand that.

114
00:14:35,035 --> 00:14:37,964
Oh, you are very intelligent.
- Stop it, sir.

115
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:40,654
You are smart.

116
00:14:45,392 --> 00:14:48,980
Excuse me!
It is Rs. 4950. Fifty rupees less.

117
00:14:49,004 --> 00:14:50,775
Two notes may be stuck together.
Please check.

118
00:14:53,013 --> 00:14:56,177
Why are you speaking in Telugu
in Mumbai, sir. Talk in Hindi.

119
00:15:01,974 --> 00:15:05,996
You saw the book she is reading..
..and recognized that she knows Telugu.

120
00:15:06,434 --> 00:15:07,431
You are great, sir.

121
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:10,304
Show me your legs, please!
- Wait, sir. A small test.

122
00:15:10,328 --> 00:15:12,089
Look at their faces and
tell me from which state they are.

123
00:15:12,113 --> 00:15:14,457
Hello! - Come on, let us go.

124
00:15:32,352 --> 00:15:35,196
Excuse me,
you can sit in my seat if you want.

125
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,216
No need.

126
00:15:37,294 --> 00:15:40,253
You were standing, so..
- What's wrong in standing?

127
00:15:40,493 --> 00:15:44,138
No, I saw you at the bank today morning.
We both are from the same state..

128
00:15:44,295 --> 00:15:45,370
It's alright.

129
00:15:50,808 --> 00:15:56,591
Now even I cannot sit in that seat.
Someone else took it.

130
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,066
How many times should we
tell you that trains are on strike.

131
00:16:06,741 --> 00:16:08,713
Trains will not run. Go!

132
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:11,567
Strike! Go away.

133
00:16:15,506 --> 00:16:17,616
Sir! Do you want auto?
Where do you want to go?

134
00:16:17,695 --> 00:16:19,317
Indian Express!
Will you come by meter?

135
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,814
Definitely! Please come.

136
00:16:21,953 --> 00:16:23,724
You didn't change even
after coming to Mumbai.

137
00:16:23,778 --> 00:16:25,868
You are the one who
didn't change and not us.

138
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:28,365
Hello!

139
00:16:30,097 --> 00:16:33,229
Trains strike and peak hours. Auto
drivers charge at least 150rupees.

140
00:16:33,308 --> 00:16:35,157
Instead of giving 150
each by going separately..

141
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,676
..let us go together.
My office is next to your bank.

142
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:54,074
Correct meter, sir. Isn't she coming?

143
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,145
May be she isn't interested. Go now.

144
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,999
Excuse me!

145
00:17:38,741 --> 00:17:40,788
I'm 16 years old and you are 15.

146
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:44,285
As if I gave you a love
letter and you tore it apart..

147
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:45,799
Why do you run away from me?

148
00:17:45,823 --> 00:17:49,618
You see! I have to know the reason.
Yesterday train were on strike.

149
00:17:49,854 --> 00:17:53,635
I asked you to come in the auto but
you didn't. That I can understand.

150
00:17:53,659 --> 00:17:55,679
It is because you have
to sit next to me in the auto.

151
00:17:55,812 --> 00:17:59,503
But what's wrong in travelling in the train? This
is 21st century. You are not a village girl.

152
00:18:00,272 --> 00:18:02,492
What's wrong if you
take the same train as me?

153
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:04,469
Why should I come
in the same train as you?

154
00:18:06,324 --> 00:18:08,623
I don't like unnecessary
association and talk with anyone.

155
00:18:08,982 --> 00:18:11,259
Even I am like that.
You misunderstood me.

156
00:18:11,283 --> 00:18:14,467
I wanted to clear your misunderstanding.
That is why I got down the train.

157
00:18:14,221 --> 00:18:16,727
I offered you a seat in the train that day.
And also about

158
00:18:16,751 --> 00:18:19,426
sharing the auto, I don't have
any ill intentions behind them.

159
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:22,015
We stay in the same area
and go to jobs by same route.

160
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,269
And catch the train at
the same station.

161
00:18:25,294 --> 00:18:27,837
I have an account in your bank
and we are Indians.

162
00:18:28,453 --> 00:18:33,364
There is no ulterior motives
behind me talking to you.

163
00:18:33,388 --> 00:18:35,161
I am not a bad person like you think.

164
00:18:35,185 --> 00:18:38,813
Hats off to you.
If I see you again, I will move away.

165
00:19:29,248 --> 00:19:31,115
Your account's cheque
isn't cleared yet.

166
00:19:31,139 --> 00:19:33,107
What can I do even
if you are in a hurry?

167
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:36,283
You come after some time.

168
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,447
What is it, sir?
Don't you have balance in the account?

169
00:19:38,471 --> 00:19:40,516
Should I lend you some?
I have money, sir.

170
00:19:40,603 --> 00:19:42,911
I have deposited the cheque three days
back. But it has not been cleared.

171
00:19:43,173 --> 00:19:44,984
I told you that I will lend you money.

172
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,420
Come on, sir.
- Sir! She will not help me for sure.

173
00:20:00,451 --> 00:20:02,182
Why wouldn't a Telugu
girl help a Telugu guy?

174
00:20:02,283 --> 00:20:03,779
Telugu people won't
help fellow Telugu people.

175
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:05,008
Is there any rule about it?

176
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,639
You wouldn't speak like this
if you know the story of Telugu crabs.

177
00:20:07,662 --> 00:20:08,646
I know crabs.

178
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:11,477
What is this Telugu crab?
Is there some story for it?

179
00:20:11,632 --> 00:20:13,843
There are some crabs in a long bottle.

180
00:20:14,007 --> 00:20:15,315
Someone caught them
and put them inside.

181
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,986
After some time two crabs
escaped pushing the bottle cap open.

182
00:20:19,064 --> 00:20:20,908
It is found that they
are Malayalam crabs. - Oh!

183
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:22,102
They come first everywhere.

184
00:20:23,057 --> 00:20:25,029
After that two Hindi
crabs came out easily.

185
00:20:25,418 --> 00:20:33,237
After that crabs from Karnataka, Assam, Gujarat came out
slowly. But Telugu crabs neither made any sound nor came out.

186
00:20:33,615 --> 00:20:36,632
When looked inside for the reason,
when one crab was climbing up..

187
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:39,627
..another Telugu crab
was pulling it down.

188
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,966
If one tries to go up, other
will pull it down and vice versa.

189
00:20:41,989 --> 00:20:45,145
Like that both of them
couldn't come out of the bottle.

190
00:20:48,037 --> 00:20:50,308
Sir! Is this a story or real?

191
00:20:50,386 --> 00:20:53,984
If we ask for help because of same
state, what if that person pull us down?

192
00:20:55,952 --> 00:20:59,553
I think you are very short tempered.
Are you from Guntur? - Why?

193
00:21:00,453 --> 00:21:01,503
Since it is famous for it's spicyness.

194
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:03,636
Show me your legs, please!
- No, it's alright. Come on.

195
00:21:23,112 --> 00:21:24,095
150!

196
00:21:24,203 --> 00:21:25,187
One minute!

197
00:21:30,869 --> 00:21:33,600
He is a native person and may cheat.
Let me bargain.

198
00:21:40,104 --> 00:21:42,638
He agreed.
Let me reduce it even further.

199
00:21:49,913 --> 00:21:50,897
Okay.

200
00:21:52,976 --> 00:21:56,410
He packed it already.
Let me ask it for less. Take this.

201
00:22:03,514 --> 00:22:05,916
Fifty rupees?!
Why don't you ask it for free?

202
00:22:05,939 --> 00:22:07,322
If you want to give
it for free then..

203
00:22:07,347 --> 00:22:08,316
You are speaking in Telugu.

204
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,345
Aren't you Hindi man?

205
00:22:09,564 --> 00:22:12,411
Aren't you dumb?
That is why I wrote it on the slate.

206
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:14,561
I don't know Hindi.
That is why I was gesturing.

207
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:16,288
How did you find out about me? Is it
because I asked you to reduce the price?

208
00:22:19,412 --> 00:22:21,704
A Telugu person pulls down another
Telugu person. I found like that.

209
00:22:21,728 --> 00:22:23,552
Do you know Telugu crab story?

210
00:22:23,849 --> 00:22:25,891
Why is he running away?

211
00:22:27,006 --> 00:22:27,990
How much?

212
00:22:34,477 --> 00:22:36,526
Ticket please!
Didn't you take the ticket?

213
00:22:36,968 --> 00:22:39,738
Sorry, sir! I was in a hurry.

214
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,343
You look like educated
and travelling without ticket?

215
00:22:42,422 --> 00:22:43,849
Sorry! - Pay the fine.

216
00:22:43,928 --> 00:22:45,067
I'll pay! I'll pay!

217
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:47,902
This is the first time
it has happened like this.

218
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:56,663
Hello! Just a minute.

219
00:22:59,716 --> 00:23:00,806
Did you call me?

220
00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:03,274
How much did you pay?
- Hundred rupees.

221
00:23:03,681 --> 00:23:05,067
Train started by the
time I reached the platform.

222
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:07,712
So I got in without taking the ticket.

223
00:23:07,849 --> 00:23:10,561
That is why.. - You will not face such
problems if you buy season ticket.

224
00:23:10,584 --> 00:23:12,307
I went there but
there was a long queue.

225
00:23:12,386 --> 00:23:13,707
After that in work tension..

226
00:23:13,785 --> 00:23:15,760
What is the hurry? There
is a train for every ten minutes.

227
00:23:15,783 --> 00:23:18,607
I have a photo session in the main studio.
First I have to go home and then go to studio.

228
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:19,637
That is why..

229
00:23:26,588 --> 00:23:29,080
Okay, sir! What about your
interview of cultural activities?

230
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:30,817
It is very difficult, sir.

231
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,760
It is difficult to
go to the shooting spot.

232
00:23:32,266 --> 00:23:35,202
It is very difficult to interview
a Hindi heroine. - Why is that?

233
00:23:35,512 --> 00:23:37,567
I went to studio round-up one day.

234
00:23:37,646 --> 00:23:39,380
Shooting arrangements
were going on there.

235
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,653
A new heroine.

236
00:23:40,732 --> 00:23:43,085
She has to come out from
the bathroom with a towel.

237
00:23:43,383 --> 00:23:45,941
He said that if she agrees,
she will be paid any amount she wants.

238
00:23:46,197 --> 00:23:48,556
She accepted and took the cheque.

239
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,648
After setting up the lighting
and shot ready, she refused to come.

240
00:23:51,727 --> 00:23:53,222
Why is that?
- She has to wear a towel.

241
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,582
She took the money for that only.

242
00:23:54,606 --> 00:23:56,684
Correct, she did take the money.

243
00:23:56,763 --> 00:23:58,967
But they asked that the
towel should be worn on the head.

244
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:01,739
There was only one towel.
How can she wear it only the head?

245
00:24:02,529 --> 00:24:04,023
What happened to the shooting?

246
00:24:04,518 --> 00:24:07,468
After that everyone discussed.
Finally her mother acted in that.

247
00:24:10,604 --> 00:24:11,944
Picture was super hit, sir.

248
00:24:48,918 --> 00:24:51,913
Hello! Hello! Excuse me, please!

249
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,332
One minute!

250
00:24:54,641 --> 00:24:56,506
I saw it in the train.
Police brought you here.

251
00:24:56,677 --> 00:24:59,236
They didn't bring me.
I came here to file a complaint.

252
00:24:59,395 --> 00:25:00,414
Is there any problem?

253
00:25:00,222 --> 00:25:01,402
Someone has stolen my handbag.

254
00:25:02,189 --> 00:25:02,851
Who is that?

255
00:25:03,004 --> 00:25:06,287
When I was walking on the platform..
A boy.. might be ten years old..

256
00:25:06,366 --> 00:25:08,189
He was walking along me.

257
00:25:08,267 --> 00:25:09,881
Suddenly I felt like
something fell on me.

258
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:12,245
I mentioned about a small boy..

259
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:14,835
He told me to use the
water nearby and wash it

260
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:17,038
When I came back after washing,
my handbag was missing.

261
00:25:17,887 --> 00:25:21,543
He was running away with my bag.
This was all his plan.

262
00:25:21,622 --> 00:25:24,895
He only put the banana
skin and the water to wash.

263
00:25:25,432 --> 00:25:27,495
Just see how he planned. - My god!

264
00:25:29,645 --> 00:25:33,311
The police inspector who was
there asked me to file a complaint.

265
00:25:33,523 --> 00:25:34,531
That is why..

266
00:25:35,302 --> 00:25:37,096
Sit there and write the complaint.

267
00:25:37,713 --> 00:25:38,696
Sit down.

268
00:25:46,277 --> 00:25:47,390
I am sorry.

269
00:25:48,602 --> 00:25:50,142
You can keep it. - It's alright.

270
00:25:50,459 --> 00:25:52,505
Was your heart in your
handbag that he has stolen it?

271
00:25:54,331 --> 00:25:55,394
I will be back in a moment.

272
00:25:55,447 --> 00:25:57,566
We do every work very
quickly in this station.

273
00:25:58,831 --> 00:25:59,916
Hello!

274
00:25:59,994 --> 00:26:02,858
You see..

275
00:26:08,455 --> 00:26:15,173
I know three south Indian women.
Hemamalini, Sridevi.. ..and you Chitra.

276
00:26:18,251 --> 00:26:20,751
Nice height and perfect figure.

277
00:26:20,775 --> 00:26:23,241
I like south Indian women.

278
00:26:23,265 --> 00:26:27,738
Hey, I will find your bag by evening.

279
00:26:31,201 --> 00:26:33,051
I hope you gave your contact number.
- Yes, sir.

280
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,501
I gave you my bank's number.

281
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:36,031
Bank?! Very good.

282
00:26:36,767 --> 00:26:37,751
Who is he?

283
00:26:39,004 --> 00:26:41,176
Friend? - Yes, friend.

284
00:26:41,255 --> 00:26:42,238
I see.

285
00:26:42,535 --> 00:26:44,521
The guy who steals the handbag of..

286
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:47,503
..a beautiful lady like you should
be punished. I'll break his bones.

287
00:26:47,582 --> 00:26:49,868
No! Don't beat him. He is just a kid.

288
00:26:49,869 --> 00:26:51,250
You have a very soft heart.

289
00:26:52,161 --> 00:26:53,938
I don't know Hindi,
not even bits and pieces.

290
00:26:54,106 --> 00:26:56,620
What did the inspector
said to upset you so much?

291
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:58,627
He said that he will
break the bones of the thief.

292
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,609
I told them not to be
severe since he is a kid.

293
00:27:00,803 --> 00:27:02,105
You have a very soft heart.

294
00:27:02,334 --> 00:27:03,514
That's what he said. In Hindi.

295
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:05,987
Do you have umbrella? - What for?

296
00:27:06,114 --> 00:27:08,042
It is going to rain for sure today.
- Why is that?

297
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,601
When I told the inspector
that I am your friend, you agreed.

298
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:14,488
It will surely rain. Before
that shall we have a cup of coffee?

299
00:27:15,036 --> 00:27:17,793
There is a nice coffee shop nearby.
Shall we go?

300
00:27:20,285 --> 00:27:21,293
No, please!

301
00:27:21,594 --> 00:27:25,065
You would have agreed if
I invited you for lunch I suppose.

302
00:27:26,054 --> 00:27:28,954
No. I will say no even then.

303
00:27:30,977 --> 00:27:35,708
Are you going to the bank? - Yes.
Auto!

304
00:27:37,092 --> 00:27:38,129
Auto!

305
00:27:41,957 --> 00:27:45,128
First auto for you and second
one for me. Surprised about two autos?

306
00:27:45,275 --> 00:27:47,762
You won't travel with
me in the same auto. Please!

307
00:27:49,031 --> 00:27:50,015
Bye!

308
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:05,906
Do you know Telugu? Madam! Did you
take honey a lot since your childhood?

309
00:28:05,907 --> 00:28:13,618
Your voice is very sweet. That is why I
asked. Can you see my face through phone?

310
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:15,732
You stopped talking suddenly.
So I asked.

311
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,430
Will you please give
the phone to Mr. Khartik

312
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:20,154
 Mr. Karthik?
Yes, he is here.

313
00:28:20,112 --> 00:28:22,100
Sir! Some lady is asking for you.

314
00:28:23,322 --> 00:28:24,306
Hello!

315
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,825
This is Chitra speaking.
Did I disturb you?

316
00:28:27,978 --> 00:28:28,961
No, what is it?

317
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:31,551
I got a phone from the police
station that they found my bag.

318
00:28:31,552 --> 00:28:33,182
They asked me to
come there to take it.

319
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:36,213
I don't want to go there alone..

320
00:28:37,032 --> 00:28:39,711
If you don't mind,
will you come with me?

321
00:28:41,884 --> 00:28:43,638
Check your personal
belongings, please!

322
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:52,286
Count the amount. Is it okay?
Is everything present?

323
00:28:55,976 --> 00:28:58,474
I told you that I know
three south Indian women.

324
00:28:59,528 --> 00:29:04,827
Hemamalini married Dharmendra.
Sridevi married Bony Kapoor.

325
00:29:06,851 --> 00:29:10,269
And you Chitra marries who?
Hello! Your way

326
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:14,742
of talking is irritating.
Better stop that.

327
00:29:14,743 --> 00:29:16,144
Okay, thank you! Thank you!

328
00:29:16,482 --> 00:29:21,164
Hello! Hello! We still have half day leave.
Should we go to our offices cancelling the leave?

329
00:29:21,188 --> 00:29:22,390
Should I call for two autos?

330
00:29:23,618 --> 00:29:27,511
No. If you have confidence, come to my
house. My mom and dad will be happy.

331
00:29:27,672 --> 00:29:30,147
They will be happy to
see something speaking Telugu.

332
00:29:31,404 --> 00:29:32,624
How much? - Sixty rupees dozen.

333
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,771
Hello! Do you want me to stay or go?

334
00:29:35,281 --> 00:29:37,746
I have invited you to my house. You are
buying fruits without answering me.

335
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:39,093
If I know your answer..

336
00:29:39,094 --> 00:29:42,006
My mother used to say that we shouldn't
go to someone's house empty handed.

337
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,973
That is why I am buying
these fruits. - Ah!

338
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,379
What happened?
- You accepted my invitation.

339
00:29:47,095 --> 00:29:49,574
I pinched to check whether
this is dream or reality. It is real.

340
00:29:49,632 --> 00:29:50,698
Auto!

341
00:30:03,745 --> 00:30:05,766
Lift in our flats
works once in a year.

342
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,939
What did that auto
driver tell you showing me?

343
00:30:09,018 --> 00:30:09,889
What was he saying?

344
00:30:09,968 --> 00:30:12,380
Nothing!
- No, he was talking about me.

345
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:15,131
You will get angry if I tell you.
- It's alright. Tell me.

346
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,280
No, leave it.

347
00:30:16,462 --> 00:30:17,770
I don't mind. Please tell me.

348
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:23,304
You didn't come in the auto on the day of trains strike. He asked
why you won't come and I said it is a tradition of pious women.

349
00:30:23,644 --> 00:30:25,982
We came together now,
so he said that we became friends.

350
00:30:26,678 --> 00:30:28,656
Will you meet that auto driver
once again? - why do you ask?

351
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,868
If you meet again, tell him this.

352
00:30:31,892 --> 00:30:33,412
Tell him that though I came with you..

353
00:30:33,451 --> 00:30:34,847
..I still follow the
tradition of pious women.

354
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,870
That's true.
You sat on the other edge of the auto.

355
00:30:37,507 --> 00:30:40,431
I was scared that you
might fall on the road.

356
00:30:48,024 --> 00:30:50,256
What is your name? - Chitra.

357
00:30:50,534 --> 00:30:52,355
It is very sweet name.

358
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:55,132
My dear! Isn't it the name of Goddess?

359
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:58,165
No, you always
misunderstand everything.

360
00:30:58,244 --> 00:31:00,163
Chitta is the name of a star.

361
00:31:00,242 --> 00:31:02,215
And the name Chitra
is another form of that.

362
00:31:02,347 --> 00:31:05,452
My wife always
misunderstand the things.

363
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,398
She gives tea when I ask for
coffee and coffee if I ask for tea.

364
00:31:08,523 --> 00:31:11,796
After we got married she
used to ask me if there are..

365
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:14,996
..Muslim and Christian
papers just like the Hindu paper.

366
00:31:16,855 --> 00:31:18,877
Water? - Thanks!

367
00:31:19,595 --> 00:31:22,408
My parents are like comedians.
Only they don't fight.

368
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:26,069
Are you working in
the same office as my son?

369
00:31:26,311 --> 00:31:29,150
No, sir! I am working in Indian bank.

370
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:30,621
How did you meet him?

371
00:31:32,869 --> 00:31:36,575
Mom! I have an account
in that bank. - I see.

372
00:31:39,176 --> 00:31:40,398
This is.. - Oh, no!

373
00:31:42,691 --> 00:31:44,635
Bathroom is on that side.
Go and wash it.

374
00:31:46,244 --> 00:31:49,400
Water will be light yellow in colour.
Don't be afraid.

375
00:31:58,435 --> 00:32:01,995
She said that she is working in some
bank. Why did our son bring her home?

376
00:32:02,074 --> 00:32:04,045
Hey, can't you keep quiet for a while?

377
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:06,175
He will scold you if he hears.

378
00:32:06,421 --> 00:32:09,896
Yes. She too seems
to have strong will.

379
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,687
Listen! Marriage is not in our hands.

380
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:14,392
It is in the hands of the One above.

381
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:16,741
Do you refer to the
people in the flat below?

382
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,753
I pointed my finger
upwards but you ask..

383
00:32:18,831 --> 00:32:20,463
..if I refer to the
people staying below.

384
00:32:20,877 --> 00:32:21,911
You may not know Hindi.

385
00:32:22,451 --> 00:32:25,285
But can't you understand
where I am pointing my finger to?

386
00:32:25,368 --> 00:32:26,697
This is a good thing.

387
00:32:29,562 --> 00:32:32,920
No matter how much I scold you,
you don't mind.

388
00:32:42,542 --> 00:32:43,525
Sir, carriage!

389
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:47,659
I will come in the evening,
sir. - Okay.

390
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:51,565
Have lunch with us. - No, sir.

391
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:52,965
Are you hesitating
because it is hotel food?

392
00:32:52,978 --> 00:32:55,636
What can we do?
My wife suffers with arthritis.

393
00:32:56,485 --> 00:33:01,847
Karthik warned us that he won't
tolerate if I let his mother cook.

394
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,785
That is why food is being ordered.

395
00:33:05,786 --> 00:33:08,969
Food is alright but papad..

396
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:12,929
You must have seen a papad
that breaks.. can it be torn?

397
00:33:13,217 --> 00:33:14,934
I will show you.

398
00:33:15,146 --> 00:33:19,773
Curd will spread it's
smell from Mumbai to Pune.

399
00:33:22,699 --> 00:33:24,782
Why I speak about all this..

400
00:33:23,019 --> 00:33:27,069
He does not want
his mother to work hard.

401
00:33:30,815 --> 00:33:35,736
He loves his mother a lot.
That is why we don't mind such things.

402
00:33:36,193 --> 00:33:37,733
Doesn't it look silly?

403
00:33:37,812 --> 00:33:38,841
No need for hotel food.

404
00:33:39,174 --> 00:33:42,831
If he gets married, everything will
be alright. But he doesn't want to.

405
00:33:45,282 --> 00:33:47,847
Please convince him to get married.

406
00:33:49,126 --> 00:33:50,744
I would have prepared the coffee.

407
00:33:50,978 --> 00:33:52,434
I thought of giving her tasty coffee.

408
00:33:52,435 --> 00:33:54,204
No, that is for my mom, sugarless.

409
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,151
Mom! - Is this?

410
00:33:57,527 --> 00:33:58,511
Dad!

411
00:33:59,118 --> 00:34:02,309
You were missing for a long time.
Did you go for a smake?

412
00:34:09,397 --> 00:34:11,514
Why do you take trouble?
- It's alright.

413
00:34:11,721 --> 00:34:13,427
We took an auto while coming.

414
00:34:13,915 --> 00:34:16,912
I have to go to station to
get my bike. Come on, let us go.

415
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,580
Where did your father work?
- He is retired.

416
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,768
Where did he work? Pastance!

417
00:34:23,992 --> 00:34:26,077
Oh, in railways.
Worked for 30years as station master.

418
00:34:26,737 --> 00:34:29,197
In Vizag. I finished my
studies in Andhar University.

419
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,402
Nice family and you have a good job.

420
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:32,865
I think your income is also good.

421
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,677
Why didn't you marry yet?

422
00:34:40,837 --> 00:34:42,764
Sorry! Did I say anything wrong?

423
00:34:46,755 --> 00:34:47,896
I didn't ask that on purpose.

424
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:50,783
Before leaving your mom was worried about  u and thats why i asked

425
00:34:55,744 --> 00:34:57,390
Bye! - Just a moment.

426
00:34:59,232 --> 00:35:00,227
What did you ask me?

427
00:35:00,305 --> 00:35:02,023
Why didn't you marry till now?

428
00:35:36,449 --> 00:35:41,982
'The breeze came to my courtyard
and gently opened the door'

429
00:35:42,005 --> 00:35:47,568
'That is what is called Love, isnt it'

430
00:35:47,569 --> 00:35:52,790
'The wind was supposed
to give news of your whereabouts'

431
00:35:53,180 --> 00:36:00,355

432
00:36:00,696 --> 00:36:05,135

437
00:36:29,847 --> 00:36:37,716
'Get ready'

438
00:36:39,925 --> 00:36:45,143
'Rule my heart'

439
00:36:45,222 --> 00:36:52,389
'Rule my heart'

440
00:37:01,367 --> 00:37:06,348
'When it rains in the rainy season,
you are my shelter'

441
00:37:06,984 --> 00:37:11,815
'Will you cover me with your sari'

442
00:37:11,894 --> 00:37:16,680
'I get intoxicated
when I hear you say that'

443
00:37:16,681 --> 00:37:21,220
'Behold me in your eyes'

444
00:37:22,131 --> 00:37:24,153
'I know about your shyness'

445
00:37:24,718 --> 00:37:26,740
'Therefore I entered your heart'

446
00:37:27,305 --> 00:37:32,835

468
00:40:00,545 --> 00:40:04,848
'Sing the lore of love
and mesmerise the air'

469
00:40:30,267 --> 00:40:33,929
I entered journalism since 1994.
Before that..

470
00:40:35,961 --> 00:40:41,032
I was passed my IPS in 87 and
my first posting was as DSP in Vizag.

471
00:40:41,528 --> 00:40:43,412
My wife's name is Aruna.

472
00:40:43,701 --> 00:40:45,691
It was an arranged marriage.

473
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,842
The marriage was done in Anakapally,
my wife's hometown.

474
00:40:50,424 --> 00:40:52,453
Two months after our marriage..

475
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:56,311
..two people were selected..

476
00:40:56,582 --> 00:41:01,395
..from Andhara Pradesh commado force
for training as bomb difusing squad.

477
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:06,669
One is me and the other is Ajay.

478
00:41:07,191 --> 00:41:08,476
My close friend.

479
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:10,294
We were a happy family.

480
00:41:10,894 --> 00:41:13,854
It is said that every mother-in-law
fights with her daughter-in-law.

481
00:41:16,081 --> 00:41:17,452
But my mom and my wife..

482
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:22,463
..were very friendly. My mom
never questions anything unnecessary.

483
00:41:22,638 --> 00:41:25,059
And my wife too..

484
00:41:25,178 --> 00:41:26,712
..used to behave according
to my parents likes.

485
00:41:26,735 --> 00:41:28,452
She was awsome in everything.

486
00:41:28,807 --> 00:41:31,537
I and Arun used to live a jolly life.

487
00:41:31,978 --> 00:41:34,473
Hey, Karthik! - Hey, sir!

488
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,603
Are you body builder? - Why?

489
00:41:36,681 --> 00:41:38,751
How can we get such a body?
- Take an inch tape.

490
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,023
The tape that tailors use.

491
00:41:41,101 --> 00:41:44,284
Chest 40, hips 28.. - Hey!

492
00:41:44,441 --> 00:41:47,568
Muscles should be 12 inches like this.

493
00:41:47,647 --> 00:41:51,565
And a beautiful girl should
be present to praise the physic.

494
00:41:51,644 --> 00:41:53,084
Hey, get lost.

495
00:41:54,537 --> 00:41:57,774
Isn't that true, body builder? - Yes.

496
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:09,649
Well done! - Do you want to try?

497
00:42:09,972 --> 00:42:11,181
Ready? Okay.

498
00:42:11,182 --> 00:42:12,607
Come on! - Okay.

499
00:42:16,213 --> 00:42:17,854
Goal! Yes!

500
00:42:21,363 --> 00:42:24,182
Come on! Come on! Try! Try again.

501
00:42:45,473 --> 00:42:47,446
What are you doing?

502
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:50,354
The shopkeeper said that
if she eats jack fruit pieces..

503
00:42:50,433 --> 00:42:52,079
..she will beget a lovely child.

504
00:42:52,158 --> 00:42:53,741
I will give this to Karthik.

505
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:55,333
You shouldn't enter his
room without knocking the door.

506
00:42:55,357 --> 00:42:59,275
Is he a collector that
I need permission to go inside?

507
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:13,162
This is fantastic!

508
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,921
Sit straight! - Ok!

509
00:43:22,178 --> 00:43:25,761
She cuts it very well.

510
00:43:26,179 --> 00:43:29,137
Does she do only haircut
or shaving as well?

511
00:43:29,138 --> 00:43:30,922
Do you want to get it done as well?

512
00:43:30,923 --> 00:43:34,091
Did you cut my hair
at least once in 45 years?

513
00:43:34,896 --> 00:43:38,895
I'm ready. When the want the session?
- I don't have faith in you.

514
00:43:38,973 --> 00:43:40,467
You might make me bald.

515
00:43:41,509 --> 00:43:43,353
Men are ready to die for their wives.

516
00:43:43,735 --> 00:43:44,719
It is a fact.

517
00:43:59,015 --> 00:44:01,181
Is it enough that children praise?

518
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,436
My wife should praise also.
Call Aruna!

519
00:44:04,182 --> 00:44:06,059
Aruna!

520
00:44:08,878 --> 00:44:10,854
What happened to him? - nothing.

521
00:44:11,123 --> 00:44:13,369
Kartik lights the
crackers with his hand.

522
00:44:13,448 --> 00:44:15,219
The kids are looking
at him with scared faces.

523
00:44:15,573 --> 00:44:17,774
He's trying to light a
1000 cracker chain with his hand.

524
00:44:17,775 --> 00:44:19,530
Is he doing that with his hand?

525
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:22,915
He has the courage to do that.
Why are you scared?

526
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:25,370
I'm afraid of even smaller things.

527
00:44:26,269 --> 00:44:28,235
If he does that,
I get even more scared.

528
00:44:28,789 --> 00:44:31,930
If he gets into any tussle,
I'm afraid that he may get hurt.

529
00:44:32,328 --> 00:44:34,925
If he goes on a flight, I'm afraid
that there might be an accident.

530
00:44:35,178 --> 00:44:37,111
When he dives into a swimming pool..

531
00:44:37,911 --> 00:44:39,600
I remain scared till he comes up

532
00:44:42,201 --> 00:44:43,917
I can't bear if
anything happens to him.

533
00:44:45,289 --> 00:44:47,407
U gave me a big list.

534
00:44:47,486 --> 00:44:50,336
Aruna, His job is to defuse bombs.

535
00:44:50,571 --> 00:44:52,579
Don't tell me that.
I'm afraid even to think.

536
00:44:53,197 --> 00:44:57,027
From the day he got the job,
I hardly sleep.

537
00:44:57,239 --> 00:45:01,190
If you are so scared and told him,
he would not have taken this job.

538
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:06,479
You are thinking about me.
Do you know how much he loves his job?

539
00:45:07,111 --> 00:45:10,561
He's very happy that he got this job.

540
00:45:10,585 --> 00:45:13,610
Do you want me to spoil that
happiness? what else can I give him?

541
00:45:17,906 --> 00:45:21,815
I don't want to take
this happiness away from him.

542
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,011
That is why I kept my fear to myself.

543
00:45:24,035 --> 00:45:26,915
I said this offhand.

544
00:45:28,326 --> 00:45:30,542
Don't tell this to him.

545
00:45:30,566 --> 00:45:33,047
His happiness is more
important than my fear.

546
00:46:05,585 --> 00:46:08,289
Aruna, Did you call me?
- Yes, come here.

547
00:46:10,013 --> 00:46:11,508
I want to introduce my friends to you.

548
00:46:12,461 --> 00:46:15,664
He is Kartik, my husband.
Assistant Commissioner!

549
00:46:15,743 --> 00:46:17,964
He gives me whatever I ask.

550
00:46:19,353 --> 00:46:21,267
She is my good friend Renu.

551
00:46:21,346 --> 00:46:23,959
She used to play a
lot of pranks at college.

552
00:46:24,158 --> 00:46:26,510
Don't say that. - Such a good friend?

553
00:46:26,589 --> 00:46:28,288
Why did you say that you
don't want to attend her marriage?

554
00:46:28,311 --> 00:46:29,894
Did she say so?

555
00:46:30,018 --> 00:46:32,432
How did you get the heart to say that?

556
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,544
You also did not come to my marriage.

557
00:46:35,939 --> 00:46:39,881
I said that sarcastically
and he's replaying it.

558
00:46:42,392 --> 00:46:44,356
I have something for you.

559
00:46:44,586 --> 00:46:48,965
Is she the bride really?
- Doesn't my face appear like that?

560
00:46:49,149 --> 00:46:52,311
Normally a bride appears shy.

561
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:55,356
But your friend doesn't
appear to be shy.

562
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:58,722
The groom has all the feelings
that you want. Don't worry.

563
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,059
Let's go home and I'll tell you.

564
00:47:00,088 --> 00:47:02,174
Why not here?

565
00:47:02,253 --> 00:47:03,504
Okay.

566
00:47:07,595 --> 00:47:10,371
I sometimes act that
I am afraid of my wife.

567
00:47:24,897 --> 00:47:25,974
Aruna.. I'm coming.

568
00:47:29,958 --> 00:47:31,301
Did you call me?

569
00:47:33,075 --> 00:47:36,093
I can't wait here till
the marriage is over. Sorry.

570
00:47:37,302 --> 00:47:38,587
I have to start immediately.

571
00:47:39,026 --> 00:47:41,281
I just got the message
about some bombs being planted.

572
00:47:42,904 --> 00:47:45,071
The inspector came
here searching for me.

573
00:47:45,149 --> 00:47:46,638
I have to go.

574
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:47,977
What did you say?

575
00:47:47,131 --> 00:47:49,107
Some bombs were planted.
People could lose their lives

576
00:47:50,062 --> 00:47:51,085
My work is to defuse them.

577
00:47:51,767 --> 00:47:52,924
Is this something new?

578
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:54,585
I have to go. Tell your friend.

579
00:47:54,664 --> 00:47:56,546
I'll call you from there. Ok?

580
00:47:59,694 --> 00:48:00,856
What is this?

581
00:48:04,832 --> 00:48:06,077
Nothing..

582
00:48:07,746 --> 00:48:08,845
Please go..

583
00:48:49,525 --> 00:48:50,723
You have done a good job.

584
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:53,691
You defuse bombs and
save lives of many people.

585
00:48:53,692 --> 00:48:55,187
Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

586
00:48:55,822 --> 00:48:58,758
Did Ajay defuse the
bomb at the railway station?

587
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:02,499
We have not received
any information yet.

588
00:49:02,578 --> 00:49:03,701
I'm waiting for it.

589
00:49:07,174 --> 00:49:08,158
How is Ajay?

590
00:49:12,515 --> 00:49:13,500
Sir!

591
00:49:14,211 --> 00:49:16,369
Sir.. About Ajay!

592
00:49:16,393 --> 00:49:17,695
His life is out of danger.

593
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:20,672
But his left leg was amputated.

594
00:49:32,753 --> 00:49:35,855
Don't worry. I'm there to take care.
I will return soon.

595
00:49:38,313 --> 00:49:40,650
Kartik.. - What is it?

596
00:49:44,445 --> 00:49:45,944
Do you like Aruna?

597
00:49:46,515 --> 00:49:47,735
Don't you know that I love her?

598
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,705
Can you do anything for her?

599
00:49:51,903 --> 00:49:53,961
Leave this job right now..

600
00:49:55,041 --> 00:49:56,418
What is the relationship with that?

601
00:49:57,318 --> 00:50:00,758
Defusing bombs is a very risky job.

602
00:50:01,658 --> 00:50:06,143
Every time you go on the job,
she's very scared.

603
00:50:07,023 --> 00:50:09,308
It is lucky that I am alive today.

604
00:50:09,385 --> 00:50:12,286
She's scared that you
too might end up like this.

605
00:50:13,738 --> 00:50:15,560
She can't bear this tension.

606
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,289
Who told you?

607
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:20,437
She told herself.
- She could have told me..

608
00:50:20,873 --> 00:50:24,490
How can she do that?
She knows how much you love this job.

609
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:37,459
God saved your life.

610
00:50:37,657 --> 00:50:39,613
Do you like me?

611
00:50:41,135 --> 00:50:44,266
You didn't hear that?
I asked if you love me.

612
00:50:44,498 --> 00:50:45,817
Why this new question?

613
00:50:45,896 --> 00:50:47,921
Please tell me. Do you like me?

614
00:50:48,669 --> 00:50:51,682
I love only you.

615
00:50:51,891 --> 00:50:54,750
Why didn't you tell me?
- About what? - I will tell you.

616
00:50:54,945 --> 00:50:57,673
Your eyes will open wide
when you hear what I say.

617
00:50:57,802 --> 00:51:00,771
But I'm not there to see them.
- Tell me what it is.

618
00:51:01,986 --> 00:51:05,023
I resigned from my job.

619
00:51:11,615 --> 00:51:14,121
For the sake of my wife.

620
00:51:14,448 --> 00:51:15,432
Are you happy?

621
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:18,839
Why don't you say anything?

622
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:22,429
You are crying.

623
00:51:23,826 --> 00:51:25,034
Silly!

624
00:51:25,167 --> 00:51:27,023
It is hard for you to get that job.

625
00:51:27,885 --> 00:51:29,689
You get a lot of fame.

626
00:51:31,849 --> 00:51:34,114
You quit the job for my sake?

627
00:51:35,055 --> 00:51:36,716
You love me so much?

628
00:51:37,941 --> 00:51:40,335
I must see you quickly.

629
00:51:42,585 --> 00:51:43,932
I want to embrace you.

630
00:51:44,185 --> 00:51:46,869
You can do that later.
Tell me when you're coming.

631
00:51:46,948 --> 00:51:48,721
I will tell you after reaching there.

632
00:51:51,814 --> 00:51:53,275
Renu, move.

633
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,657
I'm going to Madras urgently.

634
00:51:56,736 --> 00:51:59,432
If I don't go now,
my life will have no meaning.

635
00:51:59,612 --> 00:52:02,099
If I don't get a ticket
I will go standing.

636
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,584
Ok, bye! See you!

637
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:05,240
All the best!

638
00:52:41,645 --> 00:52:45,483
Help!

639
00:53:24,748 --> 00:53:27,096
There is a phone call.

640
00:53:29,944 --> 00:53:31,096
Who is speaking?

641
00:53:31,769 --> 00:53:33,740
I want to speak to Chitra.

642
00:53:33,819 --> 00:53:35,468
Who are you? - who are you?

643
00:53:36,641 --> 00:53:37,682
I'm her son.

644
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:40,792
Please call her.

645
00:53:51,048 --> 00:53:53,098
There is a phone call.

646
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:56,777
I'm Kartik speaking. - tell me.

647
00:53:57,137 --> 00:53:58,494
Look at your hand.

648
00:53:59,328 --> 00:54:00,311
What for?

649
00:54:00,597 --> 00:54:02,053
No one asked you the time on the way?

650
00:54:04,317 --> 00:54:05,665
You left your watch here.

651
00:54:05,666 --> 00:54:07,352
Do you want me to come and return it?

652
00:54:08,385 --> 00:54:10,428
Why should you make the effort?

653
00:54:11,752 --> 00:54:14,682
I will take it when
we meet tomorrow morning.

654
00:54:15,009 --> 00:54:15,993
One more thing.

655
00:54:17,391 --> 00:54:18,197
Tell me.

656
00:54:18,653 --> 00:54:21,760
A boy picked up the
phone when I called.

657
00:54:21,784 --> 00:54:26,884
Yes? - Who is he? - my son.

658
00:54:29,999 --> 00:54:30,983
I just asked.

659
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:41,653
Hello!

660
00:54:43,632 --> 00:54:44,780
Why did you come to our office?

661
00:54:44,008 --> 00:54:46,080
I need to give an
advisement in the paper.

662
00:54:47,009 --> 00:54:50,027
You came to our office for the
first time. Lets have tea together.

663
00:54:50,964 --> 00:54:52,378
Get us to 2 cups of tea.

664
00:54:54,706 --> 00:54:57,621
I know that you have secrets.
But not so much.

665
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:00,537
What do you refer to?
- That you are married and have a son.

666
00:55:00,899 --> 00:55:02,348
You kept this secret from me.

667
00:55:02,731 --> 00:55:04,188
I kept that secret?

668
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:07,485
well, u did not hide...

669
00:55:07,509 --> 00:55:08,541
But you did not ask.

670
00:55:08,988 --> 00:55:12,619
I will slap myself.
What is your husband's name?

671
00:55:14,388 --> 00:55:16,440
I am Srikanth speaking.
- Where does he work?

672
00:55:18,613 --> 00:55:21,259
He works in a bank too? in which city?

673
00:55:24,489 --> 00:55:26,718
When did you meet your
husband for the first time?

674
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:48,238
Why did you hit me?

675
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,360
Who hit whom?

676
00:55:50,439 --> 00:55:52,013
You act as if you don't know anything.

677
00:55:52,014 --> 00:55:54,288
Mind your words, ok?
- What do you mean mind my words?

678
00:55:54,974 --> 00:55:56,546
Don't pretend like a gentleman.

679
00:55:56,625 --> 00:55:57,688
What is the matter, sister?

680
00:55:57,743 --> 00:55:59,852
He hit me but acts as
if he doesn't know anything

681
00:56:00,218 --> 00:56:02,309
Just see his face! - People
like him should not be spared.

682
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:05,106
So cheap! - why do you look like that?

683
00:56:12,958 --> 00:56:14,337
Don't spare him.

684
00:56:21,425 --> 00:56:23,237
Who is he? - That man!

685
00:56:27,454 --> 00:56:30,263
Why do you look like that?
Did you start ragging in the bus?

686
00:56:31,148 --> 00:56:32,919
Madam, you may leave.
I will take care of him.

687
00:56:41,799 --> 00:56:43,074
Move on now.

688
00:56:50,176 --> 00:56:51,718
I want to dash you everyday.

689
00:56:51,797 --> 00:56:54,049
Today which guy u going to
get into trouble? I go now.

690
00:57:09,028 --> 00:57:12,079
Lalita.. you know Chitra
who sells saris in instalments?

691
00:57:12,265 --> 00:57:14,561
She got some nice saris after
a long time. Let's go and check.

692
00:57:14,562 --> 00:57:16,651
Please check this design.

693
00:57:17,096 --> 00:57:19,007
And see this.
- I feel it may be costly.

694
00:57:19,256 --> 00:57:20,657
It is not expensive.

695
00:57:20,736 --> 00:57:22,296
Thousand rupees! and see this..

696
00:57:23,274 --> 00:57:25,233
Will it lose its colour?
- No it won't.

697
00:57:25,498 --> 00:57:27,628
You work hard for the bank.

698
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:28,928
She pampers them.

699
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:33,090
Excuse me..
Please give me change for 100 rupees

700
00:57:33,169 --> 00:57:34,531
Go to the last counter.

701
00:57:40,321 --> 00:57:41,329
For 100 rupees..

702
00:57:46,257 --> 00:57:48,967
You came alone? no police with you?

703
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,242
What will you accuse me for?
That I am robbing the bank?

704
00:57:52,881 --> 00:57:54,861
I did a mistake that day.

705
00:57:55,678 --> 00:57:56,661
Very sorry.

706
00:57:56,745 --> 00:57:58,167
Is it enough to say sorry?

707
00:57:58,168 --> 00:57:59,998
Our elders write the name of God.

708
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:02,656
In the same way you must write..

709
00:58:02,735 --> 00:58:04,839
The word sorry in a full notebook.

710
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,842
Shall I give you a sari instead?

711
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:12,105
I don't have the habit of wearing
saris. It was always pant and shirt.

712
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:17,088
You laughed.
Tell me about your husband.

713
00:58:19,568 --> 00:58:22,276
I'm not yet married.

714
00:58:22,414 --> 00:58:23,898
Shall we get married then?

715
00:58:27,255 --> 00:58:28,266
Just a minute..

716
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:35,161
We will not get married.

717
00:58:35,603 --> 00:58:38,129
Will you share a
cup of coffee with me?

718
00:58:40,749 --> 00:58:42,242
Why did you get shocked?

719
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:43,964
You get shocked when
I propose marriage.

720
00:58:43,988 --> 00:58:45,522
You're shocked when
I talk about coffee.

721
00:58:45,558 --> 00:58:53,345
You keep getting shocked always. Does
your father work in the Electricity Board?

722
00:59:11,338 --> 00:59:14,462
Yes? - Is this 24, Balaji street?

723
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:17,900
You enter the house and asked
the address. - Just confirming.

724
00:59:18,105 --> 00:59:21,258
There is a lady who sells
saris - she's my sister.

725
00:59:21,336 --> 00:59:24,027
I am Sreekanth.
I work in the Indian bank.

726
00:59:24,105 --> 00:59:26,341
Your sister comes to
our bank to sell saris.

727
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:29,017
When she came yesterday she said
she wanted a ticket for the drama.

728
00:59:30,426 --> 00:59:31,507
Give me hundred rupees.

729
00:59:31,945 --> 00:59:33,128
Wait a minute.

730
00:59:34,142 --> 00:59:36,806
Chitra, Did you ask
for a drama ticket?

731
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:39,836
Someone came here and
asks for hundred rupees.

732
00:59:47,092 --> 00:59:50,464
Hello! You asked for a ticket
to the dance drama. I came to give it.

733
00:59:50,542 --> 00:59:52,555
Brother, I did not
ask anyone for a ticket.

734
00:59:53,041 --> 00:59:54,435
You actually did.

735
00:59:54,619 --> 00:59:56,758
Otherwise why would I
come this far with this ticket?

736
00:59:57,882 --> 00:59:59,455
Actually it is a dance drama.

737
00:59:59,534 --> 01:00:01,162
I said that it is a charity
show for an orphanage.

738
01:00:01,186 --> 01:00:02,620
She asked me to bring the ticket.

739
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:04,653
When I brought it she denies it.

740
01:00:04,794 --> 01:00:06,937
Check this ad in the paper.

741
01:00:07,163 --> 01:00:09,996
If there is an ad in the paper, does
it mean that I asked for the ticket?

742
01:00:10,167 --> 01:00:12,352
She says that she doesn't know
you and did not ask for the ticket.

743
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:13,089
You may leave.

744
01:00:13,283 --> 01:00:15,526
She only said that she
didn't ask for the ticket.

745
01:00:15,527 --> 01:00:16,943
She did not say she doesn't know me.

746
01:00:18,052 --> 01:00:19,501
Don't you know me?

747
01:00:21,667 --> 01:00:25,200
I know you. But it is a
lie that I asked for the ticket.

748
01:00:25,224 --> 01:00:26,247
Let's suppose it is a lie.

749
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:27,492
Who is going to gain from that?

750
01:00:28,233 --> 01:00:29,236
It is the orphans.

751
01:00:29,476 --> 01:00:31,606
The hundred rupees will
go straight to the orphanage.

752
01:00:31,685 --> 01:00:34,023
You too take a ticket.
I will get 200 rupees.

753
01:00:34,384 --> 01:00:35,840
Greetings.. Is it your sister-in-law?

754
01:00:36,581 --> 01:00:39,034
To take a ticket also.
I will get 300 rupees.

755
01:00:39,113 --> 01:00:41,837
30 kids will have
a nice meal for a day.

756
01:00:42,053 --> 01:00:44,160
I'm asking for charity. Is that wrong?

757
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:48,079
You want us to take the tickets.
We will take later.

758
01:00:48,218 --> 01:00:49,453
When will you take?

759
01:00:49,597 --> 01:00:51,829
Please come tomorrow evening.
- Thank you.

760
01:00:53,896 --> 01:00:56,324
I take your leave.
- Tell me why you actually came.

761
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:59,642
I came to sell the tickets.
- I don't believe that.

762
01:01:00,959 --> 01:01:03,086
'Hello, one minute! good morning'

763
01:01:03,506 --> 01:01:05,262
'I want to say something'

764
01:01:05,723 --> 01:01:06,930
'Get lost!'

765
01:01:15,474 --> 01:01:18,428
Have you lost your mind?
That is the proprietor's photo.

766
01:01:18,506 --> 01:01:20,502
Why do you put that here?

767
01:01:20,979 --> 01:01:21,768
Remove them.

768
01:01:22,955 --> 01:01:24,621
Excuse me!
- Where is the manager's room?

769
01:01:24,997 --> 01:01:26,749
You want to see the
room or the manager?

770
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:29,273
You must be the manager.
When will the show be over?

771
01:01:29,274 --> 01:01:30,268
At 9.30

772
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:32,515
It is one more hour.
I have some urgent work.

773
01:01:33,053 --> 01:01:35,925
There will be about 1000 people inside.
But I want to call out only three.

774
01:01:35,957 --> 01:01:39,072
I can open the door and shout.
But all will get disturbed.

775
01:01:39,444 --> 01:01:41,941
Is there any other way that
we can call only those three out?

776
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:42,060
'Try this'

777
01:01:46,412 --> 01:01:48,534
'Why do you kiss a man?'

778
01:01:48,708 --> 01:01:51,101
'You only asked me to embrace
and give a kiss - when did I say that'

779
01:01:51,102 --> 01:01:54,446
'That is the meaning of what you said'

780
01:02:08,679 --> 01:02:10,031
Hello! - Hello!

781
01:02:10,839 --> 01:02:12,048
Why did you call us outside?

782
01:02:12,127 --> 01:02:13,559
You said you will take drama tickets

783
01:02:13,929 --> 01:02:15,575
Who said so? - your wife did.

784
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:18,928
Will you make us come out like this?

785
01:02:19,165 --> 01:02:21,394
You said you will take in the evening.
I went to your house.

786
01:02:21,418 --> 01:02:24,191
The old lady said that you
came to this movie. So I came here.

787
01:02:24,686 --> 01:02:26,771
Did you come to the theatre
only for donation tickets?

788
01:02:27,263 --> 01:02:29,399
What a doubt?
I came to give the tickets.

789
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,407
I don't believe.

790
01:02:42,056 --> 01:02:43,215
Hello, I am Sreekanth.

791
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:45,606
I am a volunteer of Sivananda ashram.

792
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:48,178
It is an organisation
that serves orphans.

793
01:02:49,939 --> 01:02:51,594
This is our donation box.

794
01:02:52,105 --> 01:02:53,561
Your shop is very famous in the city.

795
01:02:54,179 --> 01:02:57,414
It will be helpful if people
donate even small amounts.

796
01:02:57,493 --> 01:02:58,988
I want your permission
to keep it here.

797
01:02:59,101 --> 01:03:00,598
Definitely! - thank you.

798
01:03:01,618 --> 01:03:05,579
It is an organisation for orphans.
There are more than 700 kids.

799
01:03:06,069 --> 01:03:09,117
We collect donations
to meet their expenses.

800
01:03:09,445 --> 01:03:11,309
We depend mainly
on public contributions.

801
01:03:11,961 --> 01:03:15,523
That is why we put donation boxes
in prominent public places like here.

802
01:03:17,514 --> 01:03:18,852
Thanks for considering my request.

803
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,653
I will come every
month for the collection.

804
01:03:20,682 --> 01:03:21,712
Thank you.

805
01:03:22,488 --> 01:03:24,153
Let me be the first person to give.

806
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:26,808
Do you work at the Sivananda ashram?

807
01:03:26,887 --> 01:03:28,610
No. I am a bank employee.

808
01:03:28,689 --> 01:03:30,696
That is for my livelihood.
This is to serve society.

809
01:03:30,762 --> 01:03:32,712
Wish you all the best. - Thank you.

810
01:03:37,895 --> 01:03:38,878
Hello..

811
01:03:41,221 --> 01:03:42,373
Are you shocked again?

812
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,913
What is the name of that ashram?

813
01:03:46,176 --> 01:03:47,186
You want to see it?

814
01:03:50,055 --> 01:03:56,857
'The entire world
is within you O lord'

815
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:01,801
'That is the Universal God'

816
01:04:01,995 --> 01:04:04,748
'He is the root cause'

817
01:04:04,827 --> 01:04:07,828
'He is the one all encompassing'

818
01:04:07,906 --> 01:04:11,046
'He is everything'

819
01:04:11,297 --> 01:04:13,696
'The creator'

820
01:04:13,774 --> 01:04:17,816
'I pray to the Lord'

821
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:25,592
'O lord Vishnu'

822
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:30,338
They are more than 750.

823
01:04:30,497 --> 01:04:32,478
No one knows when and
to whom they were born.

824
01:04:32,967 --> 01:04:35,811
One feel sad to hear each one's story.

825
01:04:38,675 --> 01:04:41,206
Parents get irritated at
their own children sometimes.

826
01:04:41,342 --> 01:04:43,248
But here they are
taken care of with love.

827
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:45,006
Great!

828
01:04:49,772 --> 01:04:51,566
I'm coming here since about six years.

829
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:54,400
Rajaram who runs this place,
is a great guy.

830
01:04:54,711 --> 01:04:56,427
I was inspired after seeing him.

831
01:04:56,506 --> 01:04:58,334
That I too must do some service.

832
01:04:59,024 --> 01:05:01,070
Don't think that it is
at the level of Mother Teresa.

833
01:05:01,771 --> 01:05:04,136
It is just part-time work.

834
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:08,044
It is not a small
thing to serve an ashram.

835
01:05:08,122 --> 01:05:10,996
You must have a very kind heart
to do social service at this age.

836
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:13,069
Thanks for praising me.

837
01:05:13,407 --> 01:05:15,408
I have now many problems
for my marriage.

838
01:05:16,009 --> 01:05:17,000
What do you mean?

839
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:19,048
I'm not alone..

840
01:05:22,042 --> 01:05:24,280
Why so? - I have a son.

841
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,479
Are you shocked again?

842
01:05:28,261 --> 01:05:29,954
It is not my own son.

843
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,674
I saw many orphans in that ashram.

844
01:05:32,752 --> 01:05:36,914
I have a desire to adopt one of them.

845
01:05:38,102 --> 01:05:42,279
I got three proposals but the girls
ran away when I spoke of adopted son.

846
01:05:42,557 --> 01:05:48,829
My parents are angry about my desire.
Is it wrong to adopt someone?

847
01:05:51,446 --> 01:05:52,572
You have tears in your eyes.

848
01:05:54,003 --> 01:05:54,987
It is ok.

849
01:05:57,374 --> 01:06:04,606
'This is a great moment'

850
01:06:37,629 --> 01:06:42,298
'The bubbly clouds have come here'

851
01:06:43,491 --> 01:06:48,098
'Shall I wait for the first
light when the lotus blooms'

852
01:06:51,211 --> 01:06:54,993
'The bubbly clouds have come here'

853
01:06:54,994 --> 01:06:58,720
'Shall I wait for the first
light when the lotus blooms'

854
01:06:59,046 --> 01:07:01,697
'The heart shines bright'

855
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:05,452
'It remembers something'

856
01:07:06,724 --> 01:07:10,837
'The heart remembers
something and shines bright'

857
01:07:10,916 --> 01:07:14,561
'I'm breathless.. I never
experienced this feeling before'

858
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:18,474
'The bubbly clouds have come here'

859
01:07:18,553 --> 01:07:22,879
'Shall I wait for the first
light when the lotus blooms'

860
01:07:37,873 --> 01:07:42,753
'Light has made
friendship with the pupil'

861
01:07:43,772 --> 01:07:48,861
'The world has come
to a standstill to see us'

862
01:07:49,527 --> 01:07:52,556
'Light has made
friendship with the pupil'

863
01:07:53,334 --> 01:07:58,250
'The world has come
to a standstill to see us'

864
01:08:06,143 --> 01:08:09,935
'The bubbly clouds have come here'

865
01:08:10,013 --> 01:08:14,377
'Shall I wait for the first
light when the lotus blooms'

866
01:09:02,437 --> 01:09:07,092
'The moon shines bright
and provides cool moonlight'

867
01:09:17,027 --> 01:09:20,860
'The moon shines bright
and provides cool moonlight'

868
01:09:24,758 --> 01:09:28,443
'The moon shines bright
and provides cool moonlight'

869
01:09:28,619 --> 01:09:32,507
'The moon shines bright
and provides cool moonlight'

870
01:09:32,586 --> 01:09:36,766
'Who does the heart refer to'

871
01:09:36,845 --> 01:09:42,179
'Who does the heart refer to'

872
01:09:48,134 --> 01:09:49,919
'It is experiencing
pangs of love separation'

873
01:09:49,998 --> 01:09:53,939
'The bubbly clouds have come here'

874
01:09:57,729 --> 01:10:02,403
'Shall I wait for the first
light when the lotus blooms'

875
01:10:41,191 --> 01:10:51,606
Chitra! Sreekanth's mother has come.
Come quickly. Put vermilion and come.

876
01:10:52,387 --> 01:10:54,585
Why did you stand there? Come in.

877
01:10:54,609 --> 01:10:55,593
Greetings.

878
01:11:02,015 --> 01:11:03,060
Please come in.

879
01:11:07,797 --> 01:11:09,254
Chitra, put that away.

880
01:11:10,564 --> 01:11:12,076
Please come in. - please come.

881
01:11:17,113 --> 01:11:18,322
Please take a seat.

882
01:11:23,169 --> 01:11:27,186
I did not come to discuss about
this match at ease. Our son liked her.

883
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:29,135
But I don't want
this marriage to happen.

884
01:11:32,715 --> 01:11:34,543
You will like me.

885
01:11:35,317 --> 01:11:37,293
That is not the issue.

886
01:11:37,639 --> 01:11:39,600
You might be a good girl.

887
01:11:39,826 --> 01:11:41,889
But I don't want you
to be my daughter-in-law.

888
01:11:44,542 --> 01:11:46,314
I don't speak without reason.

889
01:11:46,683 --> 01:11:50,609
How will you drink coffee? I drink
it without the cup touching my lips.

890
01:11:50,982 --> 01:11:53,020
You may be using onion
and garlic in your recipes.

891
01:11:53,322 --> 01:11:56,357
I don't do that. On Saturdays I fast.

892
01:11:56,631 --> 01:11:58,809
I don't do anything without
praying to Tulasi first.

893
01:11:58,304 --> 01:12:00,578
Everything must be
done the traditional way.

894
01:12:01,241 --> 01:12:03,448
Our customs are
different than yours.

895
01:12:03,897 --> 01:12:06,190
My father is a very traditional man.

896
01:12:06,339 --> 01:12:08,209
How can I change,
being born into that family?

897
01:12:12,492 --> 01:12:15,410
The two poles don't meet.
This marriage can't happen.

898
01:12:37,627 --> 01:12:38,974
The marriage band!

899
01:12:39,416 --> 01:12:41,239
Tie her the nuptial knot.

900
01:12:41,506 --> 01:12:49,177
'Sanskrit Chant'

901
01:13:16,943 --> 01:13:18,901
What is this?

902
01:13:19,925 --> 01:13:22,235
My marriage did not
happen like for other girls.

903
01:13:22,796 --> 01:13:24,890
You refer to the temple marriage?

904
01:13:25,807 --> 01:13:27,689
Your parents not come to bless us.

905
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:30,364
It would have been good
if they came to bless us.

906
01:13:31,023 --> 01:13:32,601
It is their blessings that you want.

907
01:13:33,956 --> 01:13:34,699
What are you saying?

908
01:13:34,778 --> 01:13:36,835
Yes, I'm married Chitra.

909
01:13:36,962 --> 01:13:38,356
When? - just now.

910
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:40,055
We got married in the temple.

911
01:13:40,306 --> 01:13:41,565
U did not come to the marriage.

912
01:13:43,551 --> 01:13:45,671
I called to take your
blessings over phone.

913
01:13:47,327 --> 01:13:48,462
Please call mother.

914
01:13:48,486 --> 01:13:51,193
Your mother got bedridden
due to anxiety about you.

915
01:13:52,029 --> 01:13:53,996
If she learns about your marriage..

916
01:13:54,481 --> 01:13:56,067
She will surely die.

917
01:14:01,575 --> 01:14:03,382
My mother suffers from asthma.

918
01:14:03,982 --> 01:14:06,696
It is winter season..
And there is snow fall.

919
01:14:07,604 --> 01:14:09,088
Mother is serious.

920
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:12,578
Wasn't she taken to the hospital?

921
01:14:12,602 --> 01:14:15,633
She's at home.
She doesn't want to go to hospital.

922
01:14:30,603 --> 01:14:33,435
How is mother doing now?
- Go and meet her.

923
01:14:33,797 --> 01:14:35,689
Don't misunderstand me.
- Why did you come here?

924
01:14:35,825 --> 01:14:36,881
Mother, open the door.

925
01:14:37,921 --> 01:14:38,976
Mother, please.

926
01:14:40,336 --> 01:14:42,327
Go away from here.
Consider your mother dead.

927
01:14:42,351 --> 01:14:44,057
Don't ever come to my home.

928
01:14:45,735 --> 01:14:46,762
Please understand me.

929
01:14:46,763 --> 01:14:48,065
Explain to her, father.

930
01:14:48,089 --> 01:14:49,580
Why are you adamant? -Please!

931
01:14:49,984 --> 01:14:53,539
Tell him to go away from here.
I don't want to see his face.

932
01:14:53,563 --> 01:14:55,853
Why won't mother
listened to me? - Wait.

933
01:14:57,060 --> 01:14:58,824
Listen to what I
say and open the door.

934
01:14:58,903 --> 01:15:02,232
Don't speak to him.
Tell him to go away from here.

935
01:15:06,207 --> 01:15:08,904
How is mother-in-law?
- She did not even see my face.

936
01:15:09,948 --> 01:15:12,783
When I went she closed
the door and did not come out.

937
01:15:13,096 --> 01:15:14,394
She did not speak one word to me.

938
01:15:15,118 --> 01:15:18,907
I did not expect her to
react like this at our marriage.

939
01:15:20,858 --> 01:15:22,664
Are you speaking from your home?

940
01:15:22,688 --> 01:15:25,641
I could not stay there even for
half an hour. I'm calling from Madras.

941
01:15:27,107 --> 01:15:28,563
I will be catching the train shortly.

942
01:15:29,888 --> 01:15:31,832
I feel sad about mother.

943
01:15:34,144 --> 01:15:35,144
It is all because of me.

944
01:15:35,434 --> 01:15:38,195
No.. It is I who loved you.

945
01:15:38,513 --> 01:15:42,086
I doubt whether you love me or not.
Do you love me?

946
01:15:44,356 --> 01:15:45,800
Why is there no reply?

947
01:15:46,389 --> 01:15:47,417
I nodded.

948
01:16:56,867 --> 01:16:59,487
My marital life started like
a dream but ended like a story.

949
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:02,469
After he died I did
not come out for one year.

950
01:17:03,059 --> 01:17:05,217
Because my husband
died while in service..

951
01:17:05,296 --> 01:17:07,392
I got a letter from the
bank offering me his job.

952
01:17:07,653 --> 01:17:10,541
My brother got a job
in Singapore at the same time.

953
01:17:11,014 --> 01:17:13,132
Brother said he won't leave me alone.

954
01:17:13,417 --> 01:17:16,415
I did not want to be a burden on
anyone. So I asked my brother to go.

955
01:17:17,712 --> 01:17:19,706
What happened next.. Two years ago..

956
01:17:20,730 --> 01:17:22,461
I was transferred to Bombay.

957
01:17:25,191 --> 01:17:27,142
The boy?

958
01:17:38,686 --> 01:17:41,080
What could I do in memory
of such a great husband?

959
01:17:41,903 --> 01:17:43,476
That is why as per his wish..

960
01:17:43,555 --> 01:17:47,487
I adopted a child from Sivananda
ashram and named him Siva.

961
01:17:48,506 --> 01:17:52,458
You asked me why I came to
your office. I came to give an ad.

962
01:17:53,073 --> 01:17:54,057
Obituary!

963
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:57,847
It is his fifth death
anniversary tomorrow.

964
01:18:37,676 --> 01:18:39,768
Go and pay the bill today.

965
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:47,394
Otherwise we can't give the
check tomorrow. It will be a problem.

966
01:18:46,809 --> 01:18:48,304
Do you have the money or shall I give?

967
01:18:48,784 --> 01:18:50,830
I have the money but please
send it to mother-in-law.

968
01:18:51,474 --> 01:18:54,075
I will take care of mother-in-law.
Listen to me first.

969
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:56,862
You go and pay the bill.
I will go to office.

970
01:19:01,190 --> 01:19:02,173
Greetings.

971
01:19:03,378 --> 01:19:05,484
I am Vidya's husband.
You may not have seen me.

972
01:19:05,485 --> 01:19:06,610
I used to stay in Ahmedabad.

973
01:19:07,033 --> 01:19:08,765
I closed my textile
mill and came to Mumbai.

974
01:19:08,938 --> 01:19:10,945
I think it is time for
you to go to bank. Please go.

975
01:19:11,406 --> 01:19:13,216
Please come to our home
when you find the time.

976
01:19:13,963 --> 01:19:17,037
Do you wonder how I speak Telugu?
My father's business is in Hyderabad.

977
01:19:17,529 --> 01:19:19,323
I was raised and educated there.

978
01:19:21,736 --> 01:19:22,967
I take your leave. - Greetings!

979
01:19:34,513 --> 01:19:38,440
Mother.. The young guest
is coming to our house tonight.

980
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,576
Is it your friend Manikyam?

981
01:19:40,967 --> 01:19:44,004
He has such a long beard..
Is he young?

982
01:19:44,322 --> 01:19:45,361
Why are you sleeping like that?

983
01:19:45,385 --> 01:19:48,225
I have back pain. Whom did you invite?

984
01:19:48,303 --> 01:19:49,995
A lady called Chitra
came to our house once.

985
01:19:50,392 --> 01:19:52,696
She has to go to Nagpur
for bank training.

986
01:19:52,987 --> 01:19:54,853
She was worried where
to leave her child.

987
01:19:54,932 --> 01:19:59,271
I told her to leave him here. She will
be coming here shortly with the kid.

988
01:19:59,744 --> 01:20:01,067
What are you saying?

989
01:20:01,146 --> 01:20:02,574
Did Chitra get married?

990
01:20:02,653 --> 01:20:05,838
What is the need
to leave the kid here?

991
01:20:13,221 --> 01:20:15,009
Her husband died.

992
01:20:15,539 --> 01:20:19,221
Her husband and Aruna died
in the same train accident.

993
01:20:23,955 --> 01:20:26,831
Not only that. The boy doesn't
know that she adopted him.

994
01:20:27,055 --> 01:20:28,236
You must not tell him.

995
01:20:28,438 --> 01:20:30,952
If she comes asked her to sit.
I will take my bath and come.

996
01:20:34,856 --> 01:20:37,071
Hey! - Careful!

997
01:20:38,636 --> 01:20:41,516
He will keep trying.
Please go, I will take care of him.

998
01:20:42,846 --> 01:20:44,606
Don't feel sad.. He will
cry for some time and calm down.

999
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:47,422
I'm anxious about your parents.
- They won't cry!

1000
01:20:46,969 --> 01:20:48,520
He will annoy them.

1001
01:20:50,449 --> 01:20:52,284
He is mischievous. - More than me?!

1002
01:20:56,419 --> 01:20:59,488
You have this trouble because of me.
- This is not a trouble.

1003
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:05,950
Karthik told me about you.
It is all the play of destiny.

1004
01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:07,889
Mother! - Ok.. - I take your leave.

1005
01:21:07,968 --> 01:21:09,990
Have a safe journey! - thank you.

1006
01:21:27,782 --> 01:21:29,615
Take this.. It seems you like this.

1007
01:21:33,682 --> 01:21:35,309
Come, let's go to bed.

1008
01:21:36,218 --> 01:21:38,964
You will catch cold
if you stand outside.

1009
01:21:39,252 --> 01:21:42,093
Your granny will come.
She made the bed ready.

1010
01:21:42,172 --> 01:21:43,705
Come and sleep.

1011
01:21:44,043 --> 01:21:45,084
I don't want to sleep.

1012
01:21:46,422 --> 01:21:48,973
He will not come if you call.
He will come if Kartik calls.

1013
01:21:45,974 --> 01:21:47,328
I won't come even if anyone calls.

1014
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:52,366
Mother, I got some ice cream
and put it in the fridge. Where is it?

1015
01:21:52,925 --> 01:21:55,402
Father may eat it. It is not for us.

1016
01:21:55,481 --> 01:21:56,644
Who is it for?

1017
01:21:59,639 --> 01:22:01,876
It is for an important person.

1018
01:22:03,063 --> 01:22:05,220
Look here. You should not cry. ok?

1019
01:22:05,299 --> 01:22:08,735
You are a good boy. - I want
my mother. When will she return?

1020
01:22:09,726 --> 01:22:10,887
She will return in 2 days.

1021
01:22:10,966 --> 01:22:13,807
What do you want?
Ice cream, KitKat, Polo?

1022
01:22:14,318 --> 01:22:15,308
Do you want a cold drink?

1023
01:22:17,254 --> 01:22:18,712
Do you want sketch pencils?

1024
01:22:19,304 --> 01:22:20,710
Tell me what you want.

1025
01:22:22,514 --> 01:22:25,370
I want to get drenched in the rain.
Can you bring that?

1026
01:22:25,449 --> 01:22:26,873
A very good question!

1027
01:22:26,952 --> 01:22:29,173
He wants rain. Is that ice
cream that you can bring from a shop?

1028
01:22:29,197 --> 01:22:31,409
If we pray to God, he will
send down rain. - That is true.

1029
01:22:31,432 --> 01:22:33,215
Let us all pray to God.

1030
01:22:33,483 --> 01:22:34,950
All of you close your eyes and pray.

1031
01:22:34,976 --> 01:22:38,381
Tomorrow it will rain and you
can get drenched. Let's sleep now.

1032
01:22:40,118 --> 01:22:43,436
So you won't come.
Mother, come let's go.

1033
01:22:43,461 --> 01:22:45,356
But he is not coming.

1034
01:22:58,055 --> 01:23:00,050
After some time two ghosts will come.

1035
01:23:00,074 --> 01:23:01,829
He will play with them happily.

1036
01:23:10,557 --> 01:23:11,541
What is it?

1037
01:23:13,155 --> 01:23:14,139
Let's go to sleep.

1038
01:25:08,729 --> 01:25:13,019
'O boy, The spark in
the heart is flaring up'

1039
01:25:13,464 --> 01:25:18,604
'O girl, The spark
in the heart is flaring up;

1040
01:25:19,311 --> 01:25:24,283
'The heart got entangled'

1041
01:25:27,254 --> 01:25:33,733
'Stop fire with fire like
you take a thorn with another thorn'

1042
01:25:38,093 --> 01:25:43,487
'Stop fire with fire like
you take a thorn with another thorn'

1043
01:25:43,566 --> 01:25:48,877
'The fire of love must
be ignited in my eyes'

1044
01:25:48,877 --> 01:25:53,613
'Stop fire with fire like
you take a thorn with another thorn'

1045
01:25:54,320 --> 01:26:00,281
'Our bodies must be
teased in this manner'

1046
01:26:00,359 --> 01:26:04,052
'The spark in the heart'

1047
01:26:17,459 --> 01:26:20,101
'A man considers
woman for his pleasure'

1048
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:27,825
'When bodies unite it
is a moment of exhilaration'

1049
01:26:28,232 --> 01:26:30,522
'All the senses are set on fire'

1050
01:26:30,523 --> 01:26:38,258
'My desire is hot and your
beauty matchless.. Come to me'

1051
01:26:39,054 --> 01:26:44,253
'In my warm embrace
you will not notice time'

1052
01:26:44,332 --> 01:26:49,674
'Come like a magician and enjoy me'

1053
01:26:49,847 --> 01:26:54,799
'This is the first
lesson of youth and love'

1054
01:26:54,878 --> 01:26:58,499
'The heart is set afire,
it is ignited'

1055
01:27:27,485 --> 01:27:32,166
'It feels like a bed
of cinders where desire burns'

1056
01:27:32,245 --> 01:27:38,030
'Come and enthrall
me with your beauty'

1057
01:27:38,109 --> 01:27:42,951
'I am the damsel who comes
to you with the lamp of love'

1058
01:27:43,030 --> 01:27:49,013
'Let us light the lamp together'

1059
01:27:49,092 --> 01:27:54,047
'Desire is burning hot within us'

1060
01:27:54,463 --> 01:27:56,738
'Let us act in unison'

1061
01:27:56,739 --> 01:27:59,381
'Let us become a love pair'

1062
01:27:59,911 --> 01:28:05,189
'Let's light the lamp of love..
Convert this fire into a blaze'

1063
01:28:05,267 --> 01:28:09,254
'The spark in the heart'

1064
01:28:48,292 --> 01:28:50,055
Will you come again for the holidays?
- Go safely.

1065
01:28:57,078 --> 01:28:59,458
I take your life.
Bye, grandpa and grandma.

1066
01:28:59,982 --> 01:29:00,965
Get in.

1067
01:29:13,758 --> 01:29:18,302
Kartik, We will go to that hotel
which serves our traditional food.

1068
01:29:18,662 --> 01:29:21,189
Why are you so scared
of carriage meals?

1069
01:29:23,268 --> 01:29:24,645
What else can we do?

1070
01:29:25,646 --> 01:29:28,662
The hotel food won't come
to our home for some more days.

1071
01:29:27,978 --> 01:29:28,594
Why?

1072
01:29:28,673 --> 01:29:31,730
The boy who brings the
food suffered an accident.

1073
01:29:33,809 --> 01:29:36,198
What happened to him?
- He was bringing the carriage.

1074
01:29:36,277 --> 01:29:39,127
Nothing happened to the boy.
- He is always sarcastic.

1075
01:29:39,515 --> 01:29:42,684
Kartik, Don't you find us troublesome?

1076
01:29:43,251 --> 01:29:44,860
Let me explain to him.

1077
01:29:45,394 --> 01:29:48,628
We are destined to eat hotel food.

1078
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:53,800
You won't make your mother cook.
That may be right too.

1079
01:29:54,365 --> 01:29:56,590
If she stands in the
kitchen for two minutes..

1080
01:29:56,669 --> 01:29:59,073
..you will have to
serve her rest of the day.

1081
01:29:59,896 --> 01:30:02,528
It is more than five
years since your wife died.

1082
01:30:04,529 --> 01:30:07,054
You won't agree to marry again.

1083
01:30:09,632 --> 01:30:12,887
You go to work from 10 to 5 everyday.

1084
01:30:12,888 --> 01:30:14,682
What can we say about it?

1085
01:30:15,283 --> 01:30:20,245
If it is my duty, there is nothing
to say. You will call is 5 to 6 times.

1086
01:30:20,767 --> 01:30:23,430
You faced a lot of hardship due to us.

1087
01:30:23,508 --> 01:30:25,243
I feel sad to see your condition.

1088
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:28,977
Do one thing. Take a separate room.

1089
01:30:29,056 --> 01:30:31,852
You can come and go as you want.

1090
01:30:32,029 --> 01:30:35,536
Then you can put
us in an old age home.

1091
01:30:35,615 --> 01:30:37,487
All problems will be solved.

1092
01:30:37,488 --> 01:30:38,904
Why are you talking like mad people?

1093
01:30:39,442 --> 01:30:43,607
Do you want me to shunt you
to an old age home and enjoy myself?

1094
01:30:44,361 --> 01:30:46,585
You are my responsibility
and not my burden.

1095
01:30:47,961 --> 01:30:51,261
If you say that again
I will stop smiling also.

1096
01:30:52,428 --> 01:30:54,548
Wait.

1097
01:30:52,967 --> 01:30:54,871
No question of old age home.

1098
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:59,324
He said that to make
you agree for marrying again.

1099
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:04,790
My good boy. Marry again.

1100
01:31:46,104 --> 01:31:48,957
I heard some sound and came running.

1101
01:31:49,325 --> 01:31:50,460
Please call me if needed.

1102
01:31:50,601 --> 01:31:53,486
I'm your neighbour.
I will come to help any time.

1103
01:31:53,768 --> 01:31:57,007
My wife is not at home. She
went to her hometown.. If anything..

1104
01:32:22,847 --> 01:32:23,831
Kartik sir..

1105
01:32:24,850 --> 01:32:27,862
How are you? - fine! - Hello!

1106
01:32:28,044 --> 01:32:30,149
Where are you going so fast?
- To the railway station.

1107
01:32:30,635 --> 01:32:33,072
We also are going there.
Let us go together.

1108
01:32:34,104 --> 01:32:36,386
How are your parents?
- They are fine thanks to hotel food.

1109
01:32:44,681 --> 01:32:46,366
You are a photographer, right? - Yes!

1110
01:32:46,445 --> 01:32:47,625
Do you do fashion photography?

1111
01:32:51,530 --> 01:32:52,903
No.. How about nature?

1112
01:32:53,353 --> 01:32:55,640
Kartik sir..
You are waste just like my mother.

1113
01:32:56,074 --> 01:32:58,281
I asked her for a
bat but she won't buy.

1114
01:32:58,282 --> 01:33:01,036
What will you give me if I buy for
you? - I will beat you with the bat.

1115
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:05,692
I said that for fun.
Buy me a bat first and then see.

1116
01:33:05,964 --> 01:33:09,011
I will fill your face with kisses.
- All that for buying you a bat!

1117
01:33:11,045 --> 01:33:12,533
Kartik sir.. Where is mother?

1118
01:33:15,505 --> 01:33:17,301
I'm a young boy but you're a grown-up.

1119
01:33:17,302 --> 01:33:19,229
Go and bring mother carefully. Go now.

1120
01:33:27,807 --> 01:33:30,633
Mother is grown up but
can't take care of herself.

1121
01:33:30,971 --> 01:33:33,192
Siva, We should not
talk with elders like that.

1122
01:33:33,583 --> 01:33:35,030
Mother, you are grown up.

1123
01:33:36,031 --> 01:33:37,897
Is it proper for you
to cheat a small kid?

1124
01:33:38,822 --> 01:33:40,584
Why do you take me straight
to the railway station..

1125
01:33:41,608 --> 01:33:42,828
..without buying the ice cream?

1126
01:33:58,925 --> 01:34:00,199
Why are you running?

1127
01:34:01,303 --> 01:34:04,016
The phone.. - So what?

1128
01:34:04,095 --> 01:34:06,171
I called up Chitra's bank.

1129
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:07,903
She was not there
and was not at home also.

1130
01:34:07,978 --> 01:34:09,557
I gave a message
that she should call me.

1131
01:34:09,636 --> 01:34:13,019
I thought that she might have called.
- Call her.

1132
01:34:05,098 --> 01:34:07,120
They don't have a
phone in their house.

1133
01:34:05,199 --> 01:34:06,365
She will call back.

1134
01:34:12,438 --> 01:34:14,941
Will you take a bath
or just wipe yourself?

1135
01:34:40,617 --> 01:34:42,194
Please marry Kartik.

1136
01:34:45,121 --> 01:34:47,194
It will be surprising
if I say this suddenly.

1137
01:34:49,823 --> 01:34:51,511
If you marry him..

1138
01:34:52,512 --> 01:34:54,972
Your taking care of Siva..

1139
01:34:55,786 --> 01:34:58,045
And his taking care of us,
it will solve both issues.

1140
01:34:59,448 --> 01:35:03,096
And, Me and my wife..

1141
01:35:03,332 --> 01:35:07,572
..Kartik, you and the small boy..

1142
01:35:07,868 --> 01:35:09,710
..We all will be one family.

1143
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:13,307
It will be great.

1144
01:35:18,854 --> 01:35:21,121
You both are destined
to come together.

1145
01:35:21,795 --> 01:35:25,749
Why else would your husband
and his wife die in the same accident?

1146
01:35:27,010 --> 01:35:30,028
Why did you both
have to meet in Mumbai?

1147
01:35:33,629 --> 01:35:36,464
It is god that enacts all this.

1148
01:35:45,660 --> 01:35:47,704
I know that he wants to marry you.

1149
01:35:49,986 --> 01:35:51,511
Do you like that?

1150
01:35:52,167 --> 01:35:55,419
You need not reply now.
Think it over with a calm mind.

1151
01:35:56,454 --> 01:35:58,467
I don't have the
desire to marry again.

1152
01:36:05,252 --> 01:36:07,250
My point is..

1153
01:36:23,464 --> 01:36:25,519
Shall I call the auto?

1154
01:36:26,774 --> 01:36:30,911
If I spoke anything that hurt you,
please forgive me.

1155
01:36:32,912 --> 01:36:34,221
You must forgive me.

1156
01:36:34,886 --> 01:36:37,774
Don't keep anything in your heart.
I take your leave.

1157
01:36:54,494 --> 01:37:01,882
Sorry, Kartik. It all got spoilt because of me.
If you asked her, she might have consented.

1158
01:37:04,442 --> 01:37:06,588
I acted in haste.

1159
01:37:13,827 --> 01:37:15,575
Once she has decided
not to marry again..

1160
01:37:15,853 --> 01:37:18,062
Doesn't matter who speaks to her.

1161
01:37:18,263 --> 01:37:20,541
If I asked and if she hesitates..

1162
01:37:20,542 --> 01:37:23,236
You avoided all that. Don't feel sad.

1163
01:37:27,302 --> 01:37:29,604
Father..
Let's go.

1164
01:38:05,907 --> 01:38:07,113
One minute.

1165
01:38:16,431 --> 01:38:18,417
I think you don't like to see my face.

1166
01:38:20,846 --> 01:38:23,444
I call you to say that
I know what is on your mind.

1167
01:38:24,307 --> 01:38:26,372
I won't come to meet u also.
Don't worry.

1168
01:38:59,587 --> 01:39:00,571
Please come.

1169
01:39:00,685 --> 01:39:03,631
Please sit.. Just five minutes.

1170
01:39:20,340 --> 01:39:22,488
Kartik sir..
You stopped coming. Did you forget me?

1171
01:39:22,502 --> 01:39:23,651
Nothing like that.

1172
01:39:23,841 --> 01:39:25,298
Do you know how to ride a cycle?

1173
01:39:25,484 --> 01:39:28,330
I learnt to ride a cycle
first and then a bike.

1174
01:39:30,467 --> 01:39:32,961
I bought a new cycle.
Street Cat! - very good.

1175
01:39:34,227 --> 01:39:38,462
Get ready. - She Don't know how
to ride a cycle. Will you teach?

1176
01:39:38,540 --> 01:39:41,141
Teach whom?
- I'm talking about me and not mother.

1177
01:39:41,623 --> 01:39:43,378
Ok.. - When?

1178
01:39:44,415 --> 01:39:45,452
I will come sometime.

1179
01:39:45,614 --> 01:39:47,476
You say that but will not come.

1180
01:39:48,898 --> 01:39:50,719
Tell me when you will come.

1181
01:39:53,879 --> 01:39:56,012
It is getting late for school.
- I know it.

1182
01:39:57,105 --> 01:39:58,088
Come!

1183
01:39:58,162 --> 01:40:00,602
You did not tell me when you
will come. - I will come tomorrow.

1184
01:40:04,456 --> 01:40:08,010
You say that now
but won't turn up later.

1185
01:40:20,934 --> 01:40:21,918
Don't cry.

1186
01:40:24,716 --> 01:40:25,700
Start cutting.

1187
01:41:39,687 --> 01:41:41,415
Yesterday , Chitra's neighbour tried to harrass her!...

1188
01:41:42,208 --> 01:41:45,022
Don't let her know
that I know about it.

1189
01:41:45,621 --> 01:41:48,174
I will do something
to solve this problem.

1190
01:41:50,691 --> 01:41:53,246
'It is very important
to control your anger.'

1191
01:41:54,136 --> 01:41:57,550
'High emotions cause trouble.'

1192
01:41:58,011 --> 01:42:04,513
'It is true that these blasts
have cut through our souls.'

1193
01:42:04,514 --> 01:42:07,346
'Many of our people
were killed' - Come!

1194
01:42:08,890 --> 01:42:09,877
What's this..

1195
01:42:12,229 --> 01:42:17,272
'But to take a wrong
step out of anger'

1196
01:42:17,301 --> 01:42:18,533
'It is not advisable'

1197
01:42:20,168 --> 01:42:22,976
'Those who are responsible
for these blasts'

1198
01:42:27,084 --> 01:42:29,078
'We will punish them'

1199
01:42:31,082 --> 01:42:34,170
'We will identify our enemies'

1200
01:42:37,148 --> 01:42:38,132
'At the proper time'

1201
01:42:39,429 --> 01:42:41,622
'They will be given proper punishment'

1202
01:42:42,543 --> 01:42:48,381
'It is important that
all of us maintain peace'

1203
01:42:50,056 --> 01:42:52,189
'Peace'

1204
01:42:53,197 --> 01:42:54,648
'Peace'

1205
01:42:55,951 --> 01:42:57,353
'Peace'

1206
01:43:04,865 --> 01:43:08,402
'Let him provoke against me'

1207
01:43:08,403 --> 01:43:09,718
'What make difference?'

1208
01:43:10,169 --> 01:43:12,728
'You do your work peacefully.'

1209
01:43:13,155 --> 01:43:16,000
'Not to worry I'm with you.'

1210
01:43:16,129 --> 01:43:20,622
'Every step romove
darkness your knowledge.'

1211
01:43:20,701 --> 01:43:25,920
Explain to everyones. Specially
youngster to keep control himself.

1212
01:43:32,978 --> 01:43:36,068
You shall never molest women. Ok?

1213
01:43:48,025 --> 01:43:49,022
My child..Are u fine?

1214
01:43:51,754 --> 01:43:54,786
Why are you like that? what happened?

1215
01:43:56,652 --> 01:43:58,241
I want to speak to you.

1216
01:44:05,004 --> 01:44:07,883
I have some problem and came to you.

1217
01:44:08,291 --> 01:44:09,752
I am ill at heart.

1218
01:44:10,573 --> 01:44:14,201
A neighbour tried to molest me.

1219
01:44:15,578 --> 01:44:17,672
I lost interest in life after that.

1220
01:44:20,645 --> 01:44:22,776
You don't take my advice at all.

1221
01:44:23,408 --> 01:44:25,575
Get married again. It is not wrong.

1222
01:44:27,545 --> 01:44:30,554
You must do that for your adopted son.

1223
01:44:31,896 --> 01:44:34,251
You dedicated your life
for your husband's ideals.

1224
01:44:34,424 --> 01:44:36,965
What happened? he died in an accident.

1225
01:44:38,097 --> 01:44:40,246
Will u be in a hardship
till the end for that?

1226
01:44:42,050 --> 01:44:43,636
Why don't you change your decision?

1227
01:44:43,973 --> 01:44:45,961
Do you think it will
mean betraying your husband?

1228
01:44:46,043 --> 01:44:49,178
If your husband loves you, do
you think he wants to see you suffer?

1229
01:44:49,988 --> 01:44:52,475
In the past, when husband
died the wife too used to die.

1230
01:44:52,802 --> 01:44:55,808
It was called wife's self immolation. Don't you
think that now that kind of thing is madness?

1231
01:44:58,958 --> 01:45:00,611
What you are doing now is just like that.

1232
01:45:01,820 --> 01:45:04,814
Where a dead person is buried,
flowers will grow next morning.

1233
01:45:05,153 --> 01:45:07,680
You must have seen that.
Why I tell you is..

1234
01:45:07,706 --> 01:45:10,475
We need not spoil our future
because someone close has died.

1235
01:45:13,578 --> 01:45:15,249
Death is not the end.

1236
01:45:19,024 --> 01:45:21,166
Think about marrying again.

1237
01:45:23,649 --> 01:45:24,713
Hope you'll consider that.

1238
01:46:18,744 --> 01:46:21,708
I know that my husband is a bad man.
But this bad..

1239
01:46:22,314 --> 01:46:23,652
I did not know. Please forgive me.

1240
01:46:33,011 --> 01:46:36,849
The guy not just vacating the house..
He is leaving Mumbai altogether.

1241
01:46:37,457 --> 01:46:39,987
We have a similar problem
near our home. Let's go and solve it.

1242
01:46:54,643 --> 01:46:56,624
Do you remember Rakesh marriage?

1243
01:46:56,827 --> 01:46:58,519
Our entire staff has
decided to go together.

1244
01:46:58,637 --> 01:47:00,068
Shall I tell them to pick you up?

1245
01:46:59,385 --> 01:47:02,422
It will be late by the time Siva comes
from school. I will come directly.

1246
01:47:04,220 --> 01:47:06,231
The marriage is tomorrow,
right? - Yes.

1247
01:47:06,247 --> 01:47:07,231
I forgot.

1248
01:47:09,788 --> 01:47:12,772
Siva, it is your mother.
Did you go to play cricket?

1249
01:47:13,036 --> 01:47:13,554
Yes.

1250
01:47:13,128 --> 01:47:15,674
You are searching for someone
to teach you how to ride a cycle.

1251
01:47:16,258 --> 01:47:18,869
An auntie who works with me
said that she will bring her husband.

1252
01:47:19,032 --> 01:47:21,298
Don't go anywhere. Bye!

1253
01:47:24,502 --> 01:47:26,951
We were working together
since three years.

1254
01:47:27,029 --> 01:47:28,013
Yes.. - Is that so?

1255
01:47:28,158 --> 01:47:29,196
Where is he going?

1256
01:47:34,908 --> 01:47:37,775
Siva, Why did you close
the door and go inside? come out.

1257
01:47:39,359 --> 01:47:40,440
Have your drinks.

1258
01:47:40,761 --> 01:47:43,792
My colleague brought her husband
to teach you to ride a cycle.

1259
01:47:45,013 --> 01:47:46,298
He will come right away.

1260
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:47,741
Should not behave
like this before them.

1261
01:47:47,569 --> 01:47:50,054
Did I ask you to bring him?
I will not learn from him.

1262
01:47:50,524 --> 01:47:52,466
Why? - I don't like him.

1263
01:47:52,890 --> 01:47:54,836
Will you come out or not?

1264
01:47:54,915 --> 01:47:58,091
He is feeling shy
since you are new to him.

1265
01:48:07,095 --> 01:48:08,978
We will meet again. - Bye, thank you.

1266
01:48:20,441 --> 01:48:22,373
You're getting adamant by the day.

1267
01:48:25,475 --> 01:48:27,455
What is your problem
and learning from him?

1268
01:48:27,654 --> 01:48:30,352
I will learn only from Kartik sir.

1269
01:48:58,915 --> 01:49:02,357
Siva, come here.
Siva!

1270
01:49:09,367 --> 01:49:10,351
Come close.

1271
01:49:24,147 --> 01:49:27,217
Do you want to learn
it only from Kartik sir?

1272
01:49:27,854 --> 01:49:29,825
What is the reason?

1273
01:49:30,452 --> 01:49:32,309
Do you like him so much?

1274
01:49:33,372 --> 01:49:36,877
When you met him in the saloon
and told him that he forgot you.

1275
01:49:36,955 --> 01:49:37,946
Why did you ask?

1276
01:49:38,861 --> 01:49:40,562
Because I like him.

1277
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:44,608
Why? - I don't know. But I like him.

1278
01:49:49,705 --> 01:49:51,384
Shall we all stay in one home?

1279
01:49:52,327 --> 01:49:53,398
What do you mean by 'we'?

1280
01:49:53,477 --> 01:49:55,268
You.. me..

1281
01:49:56,519 --> 01:49:57,517
Kartik sir..

1282
01:49:58,153 --> 01:50:00,148
Grandpa and grandma.. Yes!

1283
01:50:43,740 --> 01:50:48,687
'I kept standing here waiting for you'

1284
01:50:49,660 --> 01:50:54,594
'I attempt to win over your patience..
Is it possible'

1285
01:50:55,266 --> 01:51:00,206
'I kept standing here waiting for you'

1286
01:51:00,557 --> 01:51:04,562
'I attempt to win over your patience..
Is it possible'

1287
01:51:05,269 --> 01:51:06,338
'This feeling is magical'

1288
01:51:07,902 --> 01:51:09,524
'The feeling of love'

1289
01:51:10,587 --> 01:51:16,008
'It is magical, my love'

1290
01:51:21,572 --> 01:51:22,556
'Just here'

1291
01:51:40,452 --> 01:51:42,491
'My beloved'

1292
01:51:51,562 --> 01:51:56,620
'The slight showers during
evening touch the heart'

1293
01:51:56,699 --> 01:52:01,511
'I was living a lonely life..
She came to me like pleasant rain'

1294
01:52:12,968 --> 01:52:17,843
'The slight showers during
evening touch the heart'

1295
01:52:17,922 --> 01:52:23,095
'I was living a lonely life..
She came to me like pleasant rain'

1296
01:52:23,096 --> 01:52:28,413
'The songs in her eyes
reach me in soft tunes'

1297
01:52:28,598 --> 01:52:33,427
'The songs in her eyes
reach me in soft tunes'

1298
01:52:33,506 --> 01:52:35,889
'It brings joy to the heart'

1299
01:52:36,132 --> 01:52:38,480
'The tunes in the heart'

1300
01:52:38,767 --> 01:52:41,188
'Are eager for company'

1301
01:52:41,456 --> 01:52:43,875
'The tunes in the heart'

1302
01:52:44,053 --> 01:52:48,520
'The moment we unite, my
heart will carry her as a palanquin'

1303
01:52:48,599 --> 01:52:53,799
'I kept standing here waiting for you'

1304
01:52:53,877 --> 01:52:58,508
'I attempt to win over your patience..
Is it possible'

1305
01:52:58,509 --> 01:52:59,804
'The feeling is magical'

1306
01:53:24,874 --> 01:53:26,590
'It has begun'

1307
01:53:27,068 --> 01:53:28,730
'It has begun'

1308
01:53:30,125 --> 01:53:31,805
'It has begun'

1309
01:53:32,789 --> 01:53:34,496
'It has begun'

1310
01:53:35,570 --> 01:53:40,500
'The lovely girl is eager
to reach the destination'

1311
01:53:40,578 --> 01:53:45,821
'When I express my friendship to her,
she blushes'

1312
01:53:45,899 --> 01:53:50,855
'If the dams and leaves me and goes,
my life will stop'

1313
01:53:51,270 --> 01:53:56,079
'If the dams and leaves me and goes,
my life will stop'

1314
01:53:56,157 --> 01:53:58,408
'When a small squabble happened'

1315
01:53:58,775 --> 01:54:00,564
'The parrot flew away'

1316
01:54:00,565 --> 01:54:03,197
'When a small squabble happened'

1317
01:54:04,125 --> 01:54:06,373
'The parrot flew away'

1318
01:54:06,762 --> 01:54:11,304
'But she now returned to the nest'

1319
01:54:11,383 --> 01:54:14,605
'Just here'

1320
01:54:17,944 --> 01:54:23,108
'I kept standing here waiting for you'

1321
01:54:23,109 --> 01:54:27,783

'It is a magical feeling'

1324
01:54:38,595 --> 01:54:42,521
It is a magical feeling'

1325
01:55:13,448 --> 01:55:15,493
Hello! - This is Chitra speaking.

1326
01:55:18,633 --> 01:55:19,917
What is it?

1327
01:55:19,930 --> 01:55:21,703
I want to talk to you.

1328
01:55:22,440 --> 01:55:23,724
Say it in the phone.

1329
01:55:23,868 --> 01:55:26,184
No, I want to talk to you directly.

1330
01:55:26,495 --> 01:55:27,789
Will you come to the bank tomorrow?

1331
01:55:27,790 --> 01:55:29,979
No, I have another
assignment tomorrow morning.

1332
01:55:30,747 --> 01:55:32,360
We can meet in the
evening if you want to.

1333
01:55:33,480 --> 01:55:34,256
Okay.

1334
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:35,570
Where? - You tell me.

1335
01:55:36,230 --> 01:55:38,160
Near railway station at Juhu. At 5pm.

1336
01:55:39,750 --> 01:55:41,828
Okay. - We meet .

1337
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:21,880
Enough! Items are very tasty.

1338
01:56:21,904 --> 01:56:23,857
Mom! I don't understand this problem.

1339
01:56:25,372 --> 01:56:26,861
When will he sleep?

1340
01:56:28,413 --> 01:56:30,441
I want to talk about
an important matter with you.

1341
01:56:30,511 --> 01:56:31,550
That is why I came here.

1342
01:56:37,374 --> 01:56:42,054
I blamed you for the death
of my son and was angry with you.

1343
01:56:44,069 --> 01:56:47,657
Before his death my husband told me the
truth. Then only I understood my mistake.

1344
01:56:49,768 --> 01:56:51,760
Your father-in-law
too has passed away now.

1345
01:56:54,917 --> 01:56:57,894
Just became he married
you even after I said no..

1346
01:56:59,113 --> 01:57:01,058
..I didn't bless
him even by the phone.

1347
01:57:03,041 --> 01:57:05,093
He came to see me when I was ill.

1348
01:57:06,803 --> 01:57:08,890
I sent him away without
even looking at his face.

1349
01:57:10,289 --> 01:57:11,943
If I allowed him to see me that day..

1350
01:57:13,687 --> 01:57:15,856
..he would have stayed
at the house that night.

1351
01:57:15,857 --> 01:57:19,499
He wouldn't have travelled by
that train and met with the accident.

1352
01:57:20,588 --> 01:57:21,851
He died.

1353
01:57:21,875 --> 01:57:26,288
My son died because of me.
- Calm down.

1354
01:57:28,735 --> 01:57:32,694
It was my mistake. My mistake!

1355
01:57:34,963 --> 01:57:37,379
Due to caste and religion! I rejected the marriage.

1356
01:57:37,546 --> 01:57:39,562
Life is important than everything.

1357
01:57:40,363 --> 01:57:42,696
I understood the truth
after losing my son.

1358
01:57:43,617 --> 01:57:47,263
I searched everywhere for you.

1359
01:57:48,100 --> 01:57:49,721
I searched every bank.

1360
01:57:51,099 --> 01:57:53,884
I was able to meet you now.

1361
01:57:55,095 --> 01:57:56,878
For me this city is a priligrimage.

1362
01:57:57,239 --> 01:57:59,959
People visit Tirupati
or Srirangam to see the God.

1363
01:58:00,667 --> 01:58:01,743
But I came to Mumbai.

1364
01:58:01,822 --> 01:58:05,110
What are you saying? - Yes.

1365
01:58:05,433 --> 01:58:06,483
Who is God?

1366
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:09,029
The person who can forgive
others and help even..

1367
01:58:09,097 --> 01:58:11,322
..the one who caused harm
to them cannot be called God.

1368
01:58:13,246 --> 01:58:14,526
What did I do?

1369
01:58:14,744 --> 01:58:17,269
I told you that you cannot
marry my son whom you loved.

1370
01:58:17,595 --> 01:58:20,254
But you adopted a
child and raising him..

1371
01:58:21,074 --> 01:58:23,255
..and living with
the ideals of my son.

1372
01:58:25,594 --> 01:58:27,638
Instead of throwing
me out of the house..

1373
01:58:28,609 --> 01:58:32,777
..you invited me in
and served food with love.

1374
01:58:33,871 --> 01:58:34,906
You are really the God.

1375
01:58:36,178 --> 01:58:39,904
My son didn't have the pleassure
of living with such a wife.

1376
01:58:41,925 --> 01:58:42,908
Finished.

1377
01:58:44,169 --> 01:58:46,260
Even now I came to ask you a favor.

1378
01:58:47,604 --> 01:58:49,135
Would you do that?

1379
01:58:50,286 --> 01:58:52,752
I made a mistake and standing
in front of you as a culprit.

1380
01:58:53,817 --> 01:58:56,815
To atone my mistake I want..

1381
01:58:57,334 --> 01:58:59,702
..keep you and your child with me.

1382
01:59:00,797 --> 01:59:02,135
Will you come to my place with me?

1383
01:59:05,329 --> 01:59:07,340
I ordered you both
not to come to our house.

1384
01:59:08,334 --> 01:59:10,865
If you come now you
will have forgiven me.

1385
01:59:13,284 --> 01:59:14,285
Will you come?

1386
01:59:15,902 --> 01:59:21,095
I lost my child and also my husband.
I became an orphan.

1387
01:59:23,274 --> 01:59:24,915
Since I rejected you in the past..

1388
01:59:26,788 --> 01:59:30,117
..don't reject me now.

1389
01:59:31,082 --> 01:59:32,850
I pray to you.

1390
01:59:34,207 --> 01:59:39,408
Don't leave me as an orphan, Chitra.
Please forgive me.

1391
02:01:24,693 --> 02:01:26,147
What is it, dad? Is it a stone?

1392
02:01:28,335 --> 02:01:31,437
My teeth broke.

1393
02:01:31,515 --> 02:01:34,656
This hotel food will
break all my teeth.

1394
02:01:34,735 --> 02:01:36,634
Give me the papad.
I will tear it for mother.

1395
02:01:36,761 --> 02:01:38,021
Fold it nicely and then tear it.

1396
02:01:38,050 --> 02:01:40,024
No please! - Why is that?

1397
02:01:40,165 --> 02:01:42,097
Do you want to stitch it back again?

1398
02:01:44,362 --> 02:01:45,652
What is the matter, mom?

1399
02:01:46,962 --> 02:01:50,817
Chitra left the city.
That is why your mom is sad.

1400
02:01:52,241 --> 02:01:54,900
She asked you to meet
her to talk about something.

1401
02:01:55,245 --> 02:01:58,852
We thought it is some good news.
But she left this city forever.

1402
02:02:13,780 --> 02:02:17,964
Mom! Chitra leaving this
city is not important to me.

1403
02:02:18,975 --> 02:02:20,946
Please don't worry about it.

1404
02:02:21,908 --> 02:02:23,764
What I care the most is your helath.

1405
02:02:25,706 --> 02:02:28,073
You are a good guy.

1406
02:02:28,545 --> 02:02:30,701
God is really stone hearted.

1407
02:02:58,093 --> 02:03:01,560
She should have informed
you before leaving.

1408
02:03:02,069 --> 02:03:03,697
Isn't that right, Mr. Karthik?

1409
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:11,373
Drink slowly. - Enough.

1410
02:03:13,452 --> 02:03:16,185
Is it over? Where are your books?

1411
02:03:16,347 --> 02:03:18,923
Give me the bag. - Here.

1412
02:03:19,104 --> 02:03:20,721
Wait! I am coming. Hey, Shiva!

1413
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:22,860
Don't run. Hold this. That's right.

1414
02:04:02,429 --> 02:04:05,127
There were bomb explosions
in six main places in Mumbai.

1415
02:04:05,304 --> 02:04:07,825
Including the buildings of
Indian express and reserve bank..

1416
02:04:08,012 --> 02:04:10,421
..there were explosions
at different places in the city.

1417
02:04:15,026 --> 02:04:17,947
Among them Indian express
building sustained a lot of damage.

1418
02:04:27,266 --> 02:04:31,153
The first explosion happened
in the first floor of this building.

1419
02:04:32,061 --> 02:04:36,909
Hello! Mumbai's India express office?
I am calling from Ooty.

1420
02:04:36,987 --> 02:04:38,223
Do you know Telugu? What is it?

1421
02:04:38,224 --> 02:04:39,884
I saw the new about
explosions in the TV.

1422
02:04:40,097 --> 02:04:42,143
The first bomb explosion
of in our ad section, madam.

1423
02:04:42,823 --> 02:04:44,158
I hope everyone is safe.

1424
02:04:44,307 --> 02:04:46,289
Two people are in serious condition.

1425
02:04:46,649 --> 02:04:48,333
Two people serious?!

1426
02:04:49,140 --> 02:04:51,544
What about Mr. Karthik..

1427
02:04:51,690 --> 02:04:53,144
Are you talking about photo editor?

1428
02:04:53,938 --> 02:04:54,868
He is..

1429
02:04:54,628 --> 02:04:56,394
He is alright.
Nothing happened to him.

1430
02:05:01,426 --> 02:05:02,409
Thank you!

1431
02:05:41,900 --> 02:05:46,734
I don't think that I will come
home this time. I might die here only.

1432
02:05:47,365 --> 02:05:50,321
Who is going to stay forever.
I will also die someday.

1433
02:05:50,776 --> 02:05:53,778
Bring the news of Karthik's
marriage when you come to me.

1434
02:06:02,345 --> 02:06:04,678
Sir! We are going
to Ooty today evening.

1435
02:06:04,757 --> 02:06:07,473
We have to write a cover story about
Wellington military school there.

1436
02:06:07,669 --> 02:06:10,030
I have the camera and film.
I will take any number of photos.

1437
02:06:10,182 --> 02:06:12,421
Not only photos, you are the
one who is going to interview them.

1438
02:06:12,445 --> 02:06:15,964
Sir! My cousin is coming
to Mumbai for the first time.

1439
02:06:16,170 --> 02:06:17,832
I want to show her the city.

1440
02:06:18,080 --> 02:06:20,074
She is very beautiful unlike my wife.

1441
02:06:20,303 --> 02:06:22,346
I will also prepare a cover
story by the time you come back.

1442
02:06:22,369 --> 02:06:24,440
Show me your feet!
- Please stop it, sir.

1443
02:06:24,519 --> 02:06:26,213
I will do whatever you ask me to.

1444
02:06:26,214 --> 02:06:28,479
Please do me this favor. See you!

1445
02:07:18,175 --> 02:07:20,244
Mother-in-law!
We can leave in a couple of minutes.

1446
02:07:43,447 --> 02:07:45,195
What is the time?

1447
02:07:45,882 --> 02:07:46,929
7.30 madam.

1448
02:07:52,133 --> 02:07:53,369
Mother-in-law! Let us go.

1449
02:07:53,448 --> 02:07:55,026
I will pay the bill and come.

1450
02:08:21,558 --> 02:08:22,655
You..

1451
02:08:22,733 --> 02:08:25,518
I was writing an artical
about Wellington military college.

1452
02:08:25,825 --> 02:08:28,265
I came to Ooty to meet the
commondos and take their interviews.

1453
02:08:28,733 --> 02:08:31,973
Mother-in-law! He is Mr. Karthik.
He works in Indian express, Mumbai.

1454
02:08:32,285 --> 02:08:32,360
She is my mother-in-law.

1455
02:08:33,111 --> 02:08:34,750
Greetings, madam. - Greetings!

1456
02:08:35,004 --> 02:08:36,499
Just now I asked him to tell the time.

1457
02:08:37,085 --> 02:08:38,068
How are you?

1458
02:08:42,783 --> 02:08:45,802
How is Shiva? - Yes fine.

1459
02:08:46,290 --> 02:08:47,190
I take your leave, madam.

1460
02:08:47,269 --> 02:08:48,763
Okay. - See you! - Okay.

1461
02:08:49,890 --> 02:08:52,085
Did you take everything? Let us go.

1462
02:08:54,312 --> 02:08:56,834
The person who spoke with us now..

1463
02:08:57,767 --> 02:09:00,300
His wife died in a train accident.

1464
02:09:00,324 --> 02:09:02,835
The same train in which your son died.

1465
02:09:15,863 --> 02:09:17,136
Mr. Karthik!

1466
02:09:18,514 --> 02:09:20,598
Our house is nearby.
Please come there.

1467
02:09:21,357 --> 02:09:23,280
No, actually I have work.

1468
02:09:24,359 --> 02:09:27,393
If not today you can
come for lunch tomorrow.

1469
02:09:27,658 --> 02:09:30,090
I have to interview
six people tomorrow.

1470
02:09:30,333 --> 02:09:32,119
I have to find their
addresses and visit there.

1471
02:09:32,143 --> 02:09:33,573
Everyone lives in different places.

1472
02:09:33,746 --> 02:09:35,178
I don't have much time.

1473
02:09:35,256 --> 02:09:36,948
But I will definitely
pay a visit next time.

1474
02:09:38,833 --> 02:09:42,790
I heard that your wife too died in the
same accident that took away my son.

1475
02:09:45,156 --> 02:09:46,201
Chitra told me.

1476
02:09:48,545 --> 02:09:50,001
You should definitely come next time.

1477
02:09:53,711 --> 02:09:54,757
Yes. I will come.

1478
02:09:55,688 --> 02:09:57,234
We take your leave. - Okay.

1479
02:10:16,054 --> 02:10:17,038
Shiva!

1480
02:10:20,998 --> 02:10:22,330
Karthik sir came to Ooty.

1481
02:10:24,227 --> 02:10:26,181
He is coming to our house to see you.

1482
02:10:26,512 --> 02:10:27,509
When?!

1483
02:10:27,890 --> 02:10:30,137
Tomorrow afternoon for lunch. - Yeah!

1484
02:10:40,064 --> 02:10:43,482
Granny! I too learned to ride the
bicycle leaving the handle just like him.

1485
02:10:43,560 --> 02:10:48,283
Rickshaw man and Aditya
uncle were surprised to see that.

1486
02:10:49,362 --> 02:10:50,945
Tomorrow Karthik sir
is coming to our house.

1487
02:10:50,968 --> 02:10:53,537
When we were in Mumbai
I have asked him many times..

1488
02:10:53,049 --> 02:10:55,424
..to teach me how to ride a bicycle.
But he didn't teach me.

1489
02:10:57,070 --> 02:10:58,650
Tomorrow when he comes..

1490
02:11:00,729 --> 02:11:03,868
..he will be surprised to see me
riding it without holding the handle.

1491
02:11:04,785 --> 02:11:08,344
I will be meeting him at
this time tomorrow. Yes! Yes!

1492
02:11:10,133 --> 02:11:13,944
Chitra! Chitra come here once.
- What is it, mother-in-law?

1493
02:11:14,151 --> 02:11:16,064
See what your son has done.

1494
02:11:55,310 --> 02:11:58,280
Madam! Madam!
Please! One minute, madamd!

1495
02:11:58,801 --> 02:12:00,961
I cannot attend table
tennis practice today.

1496
02:12:04,040 --> 02:12:14,367
I have to go home urgently. - Why?
Karthik sir is coming.

1497
02:12:14,446 --> 02:12:19,059
Who is he? Do you like him that much?
I like him a lot.

1498
02:12:12,138 --> 02:12:14,690
You will not be in the school team.
Is that alright?

1499
02:12:14,768 --> 02:12:16,580
Just one day. Please!

1500
02:12:16,659 --> 02:12:18,608
How can I allow? You only tell me.

1501
02:12:18,756 --> 02:12:20,453
Do you want school team or house?

1502
02:12:21,373 --> 02:12:24,577
House! - Shiva!
You will be in school team.

1503
02:12:24,578 --> 02:12:28,340
Don't forget to come
for practice tomorrow.

1504
02:12:35,993 --> 02:12:37,988
The staff College was
started by the British..

1505
02:12:38,066 --> 02:12:40,140
..in the early part of last century.

1506
02:12:42,955 --> 02:12:44,967
Here we give training to majors.

1507
02:12:45,205 --> 02:12:47,552
And after training they
are posted as lieutenant colonels.

1508
02:12:47,719 --> 02:12:50,411
It is interesting to know
that the Lawrence School was..

1509
02:12:50,490 --> 02:12:53,479
..started for the
children of army officers.

1510
02:12:54,818 --> 02:12:56,730
What is the time of the train
Karthik sir is catching, granny?

1511
02:12:56,753 --> 02:12:57,737
One o'clock.

1512
02:12:57,981 --> 02:13:00,170
Uncle! What is the time now?
- 11 o'clock.

1513
02:13:00,611 --> 02:13:04,637
Still two hours left.
I would have had my TT practice.

1514
02:13:17,803 --> 02:13:18,886
Hello! - Please come.

1515
02:13:19,538 --> 02:13:21,127
I thought of going
to the station directly.

1516
02:13:21,150 --> 02:13:23,202
That is why I vacated the room.
- Oh, give it to me.

1517
02:13:23,347 --> 02:13:25,047
It's okay. - It's alright. Give me.

1518
02:13:38,588 --> 02:13:41,947
You can come in like that.
Please sit down.

1519
02:13:47,924 --> 02:13:49,057
Shiva?

1520
02:13:51,136 --> 02:13:54,114
Mother-in-law went to bring him from
school. They will be here in a moment.

1521
02:14:26,427 --> 02:14:28,061
Did your mother-in-law cook this?

1522
02:14:28,892 --> 02:14:30,375
No, I did. But don't worry.

1523
02:14:30,454 --> 02:14:31,752
It will taste like food for sure.

1524
02:14:32,247 --> 02:14:36,437
It has to be. I am not joking.
I didn't eat anything since morning.

1525
02:14:37,569 --> 02:14:39,068
I never tasted the food you cook.

1526
02:14:40,737 --> 02:14:42,477
I am about to eat
it for the first time.

1527
02:14:42,807 --> 02:14:45,844
Do you still have account
in the bank I worked at Mumbai?

1528
02:14:46,355 --> 02:14:49,383
Or did you close it?

1529
02:14:50,384 --> 02:14:51,770
How can I close that?

1530
02:14:54,713 --> 02:14:57,453
Account is still there
but I will not close it.

1531
02:15:22,752 --> 02:15:25,535
If I don't say it now,
then I can never say it.

1532
02:15:27,028 --> 02:15:29,720
Your father came to me
to talk about our marriage once.

1533
02:15:29,925 --> 02:15:32,719
I told him that I am not interested.
After that we didn't meet.

1534
02:15:34,966 --> 02:15:37,921
After that I called you one day
to speak about an important matter..

1535
02:15:38,618 --> 02:15:40,346
..and asked you to
come to the station.

1536
02:15:40,586 --> 02:15:42,202
Should I tell you what it was about?

1537
02:15:44,746 --> 02:15:46,538
To give my consent to our marriage.

1538
02:15:50,390 --> 02:15:53,013
But unexpectedly my
mother-in-law came to my house.

1539
02:15:54,047 --> 02:15:57,994
She said that she is alone
and have no one to take care of her.

1540
02:15:59,749 --> 02:16:00,986
After listening to her..

1541
02:16:01,505 --> 02:16:03,859
..I thought that it is correct
to remain single like this.

1542
02:16:06,667 --> 02:16:11,309
I have decided to be with
her forever and quit my job.

1543
02:16:13,653 --> 02:16:15,678
I should have told you before leaving.

1544
02:16:18,643 --> 02:16:20,463
But i couldn't dare to do that.

1545
02:16:24,008 --> 02:16:26,288
How long did you wait for me?

1546
02:16:28,207 --> 02:16:30,084
Actually.. it's alright.

1547
02:16:31,580 --> 02:16:34,572
I cried in my heart for
many days...

1548
02:16:34,596 --> 02:16:37,454
 for making  u wait at the station
without informing u.

1549
02:16:38,822 --> 02:16:41,969
You wouldn't have asked
anything ...even if I don't say it now

1550
02:16:44,594 --> 02:16:47,233
 because
u are such a good man

1551
02:16:49,960 --> 02:16:51,251
Uncle!

1552
02:16:53,425 --> 02:16:54,920
Karthik sir might have reached by now.

1553
02:16:57,186 --> 02:16:58,408
Tell me, granny.

1554
02:17:03,295 --> 02:17:04,318
I have to catch the train.

1555
02:17:04,962 --> 02:17:07,201
I must go to the office tomorrow.
- Have your lunch and go.

1556
02:17:07,225 --> 02:17:08,796
No, I will be late.

1557
02:17:09,276 --> 02:17:13,043
You didn't eat the food I cooked.
I thought you will eat it today.

1558
02:17:13,419 --> 02:17:16,402
Everything we hope for do not happen.
This too is like that.

1559
02:17:26,188 --> 02:17:30,145
I have to catch the train. Tell your
mother-in-law not to misunderstand.

1560
02:17:33,413 --> 02:17:35,649
I will be going now.

1561
02:17:37,427 --> 02:17:40,914
Oh, I am sorry! I forgot.

1562
02:17:42,476 --> 02:17:45,256
Give this to Shiva.

1563
02:17:45,802 --> 02:17:49,131
Shiva was eagerly waiting for you.

1564
02:17:49,719 --> 02:17:52,600
All this was done by him.
Specially for you.

1565
02:18:07,813 --> 02:18:09,423
You will fall down. Slowly!

1566
02:18:14,302 --> 02:18:15,897
Mom! Did he go already?

1567
02:18:17,158 --> 02:18:18,141
Or didn't he come?

1568
02:18:18,192 --> 02:18:20,793
He came and waited for you.

1569
02:18:21,135 --> 02:18:23,259
But he was getting late
to catch the train, so he left.

1570
02:18:23,960 --> 02:18:25,076
He asked me to give you this.

1571
02:18:25,100 --> 02:18:26,361
What is this?

1572
02:18:26,386 --> 02:18:30,167
- O God!
I never saw such traffic in this city.

1573
02:18:56,145 --> 02:19:00,120
I wanted to show these
merit cards to Karthik sir.

1574
02:19:00,199 --> 02:19:02,576
I skipped table tennis
practice to see him.

1575
02:19:03,024 --> 02:19:04,596
Everything is waste.

1576
02:19:05,512 --> 02:19:06,496
Mom!

1577
02:19:07,948 --> 02:19:10,067
Shiva! Don't cry.

1578
02:19:11,849 --> 02:19:13,545
Calm down. Don't cry.

1579
02:19:14,163 --> 02:19:17,907
I wanted to show him how I ride
bicycle without holding the handle.

1580
02:19:18,878 --> 02:19:21,064
But he left without seeing that.

1581
02:19:23,403 --> 02:19:25,610
He would have stayed
back if he loves me.

1582
02:19:26,434 --> 02:19:27,450
Nothing like that.

1583
02:19:28,005 --> 02:19:31,430
He loves you a lot.
That is why he brought you present.

1584
02:19:31,990 --> 02:19:35,056
He said he will come to Ooty again.
Then he will come here.

1585
02:19:37,071 --> 02:19:39,356
Or we can go to Mumbai..

1586
02:19:40,103 --> 02:19:42,773
..and visit his house.
I'll take you there. Okay?

1587
02:19:44,466 --> 02:19:46,820
You always say that but never do.

1588
02:19:47,268 --> 02:19:51,261
What did you tell me the other day?
You, me, granny, grandpa..

1589
02:19:51,862 --> 02:19:54,048
..and Karthik sir can live
in the same house. - Shiva!

1590
02:19:53,633 --> 02:19:56,413
You forgot everything
when grandma came to our house.

1591
02:19:57,598 --> 02:19:59,809
No. - I won't believe
you no matter what you say.

1592
02:20:22,688 --> 02:20:23,844
Karthik sir!

1593
02:20:59,856 --> 02:21:00,916
Karthik sir!

1594
02:21:04,137 --> 02:21:05,365
Yes! Yes!

1595
02:21:23,216 --> 02:21:25,451
Now tell me. Did you like this?

1596
02:21:25,589 --> 02:21:27,124
Yes. - It has been
long since I saw you.

1597
02:21:31,250 --> 02:21:34,404
Shiva!
You go to your mother.

1598
02:21:39,403 --> 02:21:44,039
My child!
At least you could have told me.

1599
02:21:44,674 --> 02:21:45,910
If he didn't speak..

1600
02:21:45,077 --> 02:21:47,451
..I would have made
a big mistake again.

1601
02:21:49,981 --> 02:21:52,225
I have troubled Chitra all
these days by keeping her away.

1602
02:21:52,564 --> 02:21:54,901
Now I am troubling her
by asking her to stay with me.

1603
02:21:56,130 --> 02:21:58,912
Without thinking that she needs
the support of nice guy like you..

1604
02:21:59,953 --> 02:22:02,572
..I was thinking
selfishly about myself.

1605
02:22:05,541 --> 02:22:07,788
You both are younger than me.

1606
02:22:08,426 --> 02:22:09,910
You thought with presence of mind..

1607
02:22:10,093 --> 02:22:11,899
..and with great
sense of responsibility.

1608
02:22:13,766 --> 02:22:16,392
May be she still thinks that
I am bound to my old principles.

1609
02:22:16,607 --> 02:22:18,668
She didn't say anything
about this matter.

1610
02:22:21,095 --> 02:22:23,691
But I have changed completely.

1611
02:22:25,066 --> 02:22:27,205
I did a lot of injustice to Chitra.

1612
02:22:27,444 --> 02:22:29,569
But still she takes care
of me with a lot of affection.

1613
02:22:30,179 --> 02:22:31,972
She is a nice girl.

1614
02:22:32,963 --> 02:22:34,541
I want you two to marry.

1615
02:22:36,618 --> 02:22:40,045
For my sake.. look at that kid..

1616
02:22:40,948 --> 02:22:42,012
For him.

1617
02:22:44,976 --> 02:22:48,503
Please marry her. Will you?

1618
02:23:51,092 --> 02:23:52,076
Mom!

1619
02:24:31,235 --> 02:24:34,421
'Are you the flowing
river or the rising tide'

1620
02:24:34,500 --> 02:24:38,229
'You have many talents within'

1621
02:24:38,308 --> 02:24:41,414
'You are the love of my heart,
the companion of my life'

1622
02:24:41,415 --> 02:24:44,164
'You are the mother of sacrifice'

1623
02:24:44,743 --> 02:24:47,814
'The small steps produce
the music of anklets'

1624
02:24:47,903 --> 02:24:51,508
'The froth in the water
is glorious like your face'

1625
02:24:51,742 --> 02:24:54,836
'The small steps produce
the music of anklets'

1626
02:24:54,914 --> 02:24:58,896
'The froth in the water
is glorious like your face'
