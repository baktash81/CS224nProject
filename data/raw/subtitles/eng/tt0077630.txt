- You aren't thinking of closing me up?

The merchants across the street
wouldn<i>'</i>t let you.

No saloons, no trail herds. No trail herds

Right as rain, Charlie.

Anything else?

81
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:59,449
There's nothing I want from you, Charlie,

- He went for his gun first.
- The deal was crooked.

What are you after, Dan? Why don't you
let this town shoot it out and die?

132
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,081
There are people in it.

133
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:30,247
What kind? You think anybody
in this town has any solution for it?

134
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,865
Maybe not.

135
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,994
That<i>'</i>s the weakness of an honest marshal.
You got too doggone much pride.

Maybe.

- I guess I'd better be gettin<i>'</i> along.
- Me, too.

149

You had to knock out the brains of the
most influential cattleman on the trail!

150
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:49,998
He's the only one that bothered me.

151
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,662
Should Dan have let him kill a man
in cold blood?

152
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:55,078
Cap Ryker was just shootin<i>'</i> off his mouth.

153
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,745
You<i>'</i>ve overlooked
that pretty little star.

154
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,661
- Who put it there?
- You did.

155
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:02,283
With instructions
to keep this town peaceful

156
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:04,533
and not let trail hands get out of hand.

157
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:06,874
I didn't tell him to drive business away.

158
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,993
What chance would we have if Fair and
Ryker got along without any merchants?

159
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,616
All this trouble
over one no-count gambler.

160
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,993
If there's any killing, Dan just sees
to it it<i>'</i>s done pleasantly? Is that it?

161
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,867
Now, Sherry, four months ago,
he didn<i>'</i>t have a dime.

162
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,197
The drought killed off half his cattle
and he needed a job.

163
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:27,200
- Right.
- As town supervisor, I made him Marshal.

164
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:30,780
- Still right.
- Can I ask him to watch his step or not?

165
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,999
Father, what do you want Dan to do?

166
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:37,949
Maybe if he went to Cap Ryker and said
it was all a mistake, maybe apologise?

167
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,994
Apologise to Ryker?

168
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:43,367

into your parlour windows

just to hear the women scream.

170
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:53,489
If you're just a wood tick hangin' on
to a trail town, you<i>'</i>re a lost cause.

171
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:56,082
I suppose you'd like to see me close up?

172
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,826
No, I'd like to see you buck up
and not let <i>'</i>em know how weak you feel.

173
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:03,155
There may be another kind of business
here for you soon.

174
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:06,784
You mean homesteaders again?
They haven't a chance of surviving.

175
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:10,364
Maybe I'd rather do business
with homesteaders than cattlemen.

176
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,992
But I<i>'</i>m not gonna be wiped out
for my likes and dislikes.

177
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,912
I<i>'</i>m not proud. I've got to compromise.

178
00:13:17,042 --> 00:13:20,409
And what I've got to do,
you've got to do, too.

179
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:25,286
Then get yourself another marshal. I'm not
wearin' a star that don't mean anything.

180
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:28,955
Wait a minute, Dan.
Now you're getting mad. You're Marshal.

181
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,539
I'm Marshal.

(D ISTANT HORN)

183
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,241
Not even an hour late today.

184
00:13:56,917 --> 00:14:00,284
Dan, I think you<i>'</i>re right.
You should resign.

185
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,574
How did you know I was here?

186
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,699
I always know where you are.

187
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:09,826
No, I'm not resigning. I was only trying
to put some steel in Ed.

188
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,040
You didn't succeed. You never will.

189
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,745
- Never's a long time.
- Howdy, folks.

190
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,207
I hear you had
a little trouble today, Dan.

191
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:21,575
Nothing important.
You've filed for re-election, Bravo?

192
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,905
They talked me into it.
I figured on opening up a saloon

193
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:29,661
or going back to dentistry, but somebody
has to keep law and order in the county.

194
00:14:29,792 --> 00:14:33,114
Law and order! Why don't you try
helping Dan around here?

195
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,949
That wouldn't be fair, ma'am.
I run the county, Dan runs the town.

196
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,870
Besides, me and Dan
don't always see eye to eye.

197
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,492
- Bravo, I thought we were old friends.
- We are, Dan. We are.

198
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:49,039
But you've got to kick up a fuss about
things that are bound to happen anyway.

199
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:51,158
I don't figure that way.

200
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:54,989
A man's got to live. Cows get lost.

201
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:59,118
Sometimes accidents happen
and fellas get killed.

202
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,616
Why get hot under the collar about it?

203
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,368
And why go huntin<i>'</i> for fellas
that don't want to be found?

Where's the Sheriff?

207
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,697
Isn't the train making enough noise
without you adding to it?

208
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,290
Sheriff, the train was held up.

209
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:24,373
The train held up? Are you sure?

210
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,697
Of course I'm sure. I was on it.
Just three miles out of town.

211
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,323
- What town?
- This one.

212
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:32,950
He was a passenger. Suddenly,
he pulled a gun and held up the coach.

213
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,573
- Get much?
- I don't know.

214
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:38,075
He fired a shot over my head,
then he jumped off around the turn.

215
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,199
That's a dangerous thing to do.

216
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,198
He got 50 dollars from me.

217
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,745
That<i>'</i>s a lot of money
to be travelling with.

218
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,491
If you get a posse started,
you might catch him.

219
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,583
Might catch the wrong man, too.
What did he look like?

220
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,824
Tall, brown eyes and a black beard.

221
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,950
- He had a brown beard.
- You see? No identification.

222
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,913
Poor old Bravo.
I wonder how he'll get out of this one.

223
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:02,998
You'll probably help him.

224
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,457
Not me. County matter.

225
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:09,576
It'll probably make him late
for our game of fan-tan at Big Annie's.

226
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,573
Why do you go there, Dan?

227
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:16,030
Annie makes good drinks
and playing fan-tan with Bravo

228
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:19,580
in a boarding house full of girls
is quite interesting.

229
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:24,077
Well, now when the gossips ask me
why you go there, I can tell them.

230

Mister, can you tell me
where the homesteaders' camp is?

234
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:36,499
I'm looking for a man named Hannaberry.

235
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:39,537
Two blocks down the street,
turn left and keep walking.

236
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:41,658
Thank you, mister.

237
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:44,623

myself. Want a ride, son?

- Yes, mister.
- Follow me. I'll show you the way.

- Where are you all from, Mr Hannaberry?

251
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,449

I'm just Town Marshal of Abilene.

I'd have guessed you was closer
to the land. Cattle maybe.

There's friendlier land than this
around here.

257
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,915
Got told we can raise
20 bushels of wheat to the acre.

258
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:35,283
Didn't tell you this was cattle country.

259
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:38,204
It's government land.
As much ours as anybody's.

260
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:41,166
The opinion in town
is you won't last long.

261
00:18:41,292 --> 00:18:44,079
The opinion here is we will.

262
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:48,998
We've brought our families and we're
gonna make this a fit country for 'em.

263
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,161

- Sure did.

money off homesteaders than off cattle,

(SCREAMING)

337
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:44,409
I told Charlie
there were rats in the basement.

338
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:50,457
Who's breaking up my act this time?

339
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:52,574
- I don't know.
- Watch it, boys.

340
00:27:02,042 --> 00:27:04,533
- You again!
- What happened?

341
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:08,740
He took a pot shot at me in the alley.
Ever seen him before, Charlie?

342
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:10,786
- One of Ryker's men.
- Oh.

343
00:27:10,917 --> 00:27:14,239
Maybe some day I can finish a song
without you breaking it up.

344
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:18,368
Sounded awfully good down there,
maybe because I couldn't hear the words.

345
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,910
Oh!

346
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:22,494
What<i>'</i>s that for?

347
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:25,412
For playing target
for four dollars a day!

348
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:39,200
Sure been a long, dull evening, ain't it?

349
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,208

- Mended your petticoat, Rita.
- Thanks.

354
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:05,118
- What are you all dressed up for?
- I didn't feel like changing.

355
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:10,872
Good evening, Dan. Sit down. We'll all
play as soon as I<i>'</i>ve beaten this expert.

356
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,991
Less talk and more play.

Makes 4.40 you owe me.

360
00:28:26,167 --> 00:28:29,000
Sometimes, Bravo,
I marvel at your intelligence.

361
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,457
- Me, too.
- Sit in on a couple of hands, Rita?

362
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:34,746
No, thanks. I sat in on a shooting tonight
and it tired me out.

363
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:36,706
Anybody get hurt?

364
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:40,030
The Marshal<i>'</i>s got a sore neck
from sticking it out again.

365
00:28:40,167 --> 00:28:44,240
- Sore shins, but I'm not sure from what.
- I kicked you. Again.

366
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:46,366
- I thought we<i>'</i>d play fan-tan.
- Why?

367
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,663
You're getting loco
from mixing in everybody's business!

368
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:53,455
The trail hands pay for their drinks
and canned goods. Let them alone!

369
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:57,326
Any idea what this town<i>'</i>d be like
if the trail hands weren't kept in line?

370
00:28:57,458 --> 00:28:59,289
Is this fan-tan or a town meeting?

371
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:04,116
So he's gonna teach them to be polite
and get shot because that's his job?

372
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,491
Why doesn't he go to work
for Charlie Fair?

373
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:09,458
He'll still be here
after we've had four new marshals!

374
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:11,824
That's an interesting point. Will he?

375
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:15,871
- What's interesting about it?
- This is not a one-day fight.

376
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,120
It's the rider against the settler,
the quick drunk against the family.

377
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:25,869
Abilene may close out the cattle when the
country's settled up. What'll you do then?

378
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,197
This town is never going to close
and I'm never going to move.

379
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,324
- This is my kind of life.
- Why?

380
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:33,619
Because I like it and it likes me

381
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:37,322
and I don't look well in an apron
and don't ask so many questions!

382
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,992
Would anybody be interested
in playing a little fan-tan?

383
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:47,037
Come to think of it, I would.

384
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,783
- Seven of spades.
- Eight of spades.

385
00:29:57,875 --> 00:30:00,708
- I pass.
- Nine of spades, ten of spades.

386
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:03,415
Jack, queen, king of spades. Play!

387
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:23,414
The barn first, then the house.
Light up a couple of them torches.

388
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:28,578

That's mighty hard luck, Mrs Canby.

396
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,332
You sure got all our sympathy.

397
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:46,827
But why should anybody want to harm us?
We're a peaceable people.

398
00:32:46,958 --> 00:32:50,621
I'll tell you why.
Because cattlemen hate farmers.

399
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:59,660
There's only one thing to do if we want
to stay here and that's to fight.

400
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:01,373
Easy, son.

401
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,197
We have as much right here as anybody.
The cattlemen don't own the land.

402
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,161
- Who else would wanna drive us out?
- Yes!

403
00:33:11,292 --> 00:33:15,456
Quiet, quiet. This here investigation
is gettin' out of control.

404
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:18,905
Be quiet until I finish askin' questions
of the witnesses.

405
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:24,785
Did anybody here recognise the
perpetrators of this dastardly deed?

406
00:33:24,917 --> 00:33:26,873
I recognised one of <i>'</i>em.

407
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,697
How could you recognise him in the dark?
It was dark, wasn't it?

408
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:34,280
Farmers can see better in the dark
than most folks.

409
00:33:34,417 --> 00:33:38,490
I know a farmer who can<i>'</i>t see his hand
before his eyes. Fella named Donaldson.

410

What's his name, Frank? Go ahead,
tell 'em his name like you told me.

00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:46,324
Jet Younger.

412
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:51,784

- They found out who it was?
- Jet Younger.

417
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:17,867
But it didn't happen in town.
It's a county matter.

418
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,082
Why do you have to get mixed up in it?

419
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:23,905
Somebody in town sent Jet Younger
to burn out those homesteaders.

420
00:34:24,042 --> 00:34:27,205
Somebody in town ought
to do something about it.

421

I don<i>'</i>t suppose it would make
any difference if I asked you not to go.

No.

423
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:46,412
I thought you<i>'</i>d be in.

424
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:50,239
- How did you figure that one?
- Younger and Fair add up.

425

I sent word to Bravo that as far as I<i>'</i>m
concerned, I want Jet Younger brought in.

429

I sent for you, Dan, because I heard
you might give up marshallin'.

00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:28,280
- I did say something about it.
- I could use a man.

431
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:31,375
I always figured
I could land a job with you, Charlie.

00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,992
- How soon do you plan to quit?
- Well, now, that depends.

Have you got the final figures yet,
Charlie?

434
00:35:41,667 --> 00:35:45,285
Just about.
Oh, meet my new partner, Dan.

you want an afternoon game.

What hearing?

443
00:36:26,208 --> 00:36:30,702
Oh, yeah, that's all over. I got a warrant
for Jet right there in my coat pocket.

00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:35,242
- Leaving soon?
- Soon as I get 4.40 back from...

445
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:37,866
- Why?
- Thought you might need a little help.

446
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,073
How do you like that? I'll have him back
in jail before he knows what time it is.

- Play, Annie. You<i>'</i>re holdin' up justice.
- Seven of diamonds.

- Something funny about this.
- What?

00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:51,200
- Your enthusiasm. Jet's a killer.
- You think I'm a bumblebee?

- I would mind!

or are you interested in my well-being?

- Play, Annie.
- Eight of diamonds.

Why are you going
on this manhunt with Bravo?

459
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,662
Always help a fellow officer of the law.

up in the hills away from people.

Ouch.

480
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:49,030
Good idea, but it didn't work.
Let her out in ten minutes.

You got three deputies.
What more do you want?

487
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:55,867
Had three deputies.
Pulled out on us last night.

You mean them polecats hightailed it?

489

About 3am. They didn't make too much
noise. I went right back to sleep.

490

If you seen 'em go,
why didn<i>'</i>t you stop 'em?

491

Wouldn<i>'</i>t have been much use to us.
Their hearts weren<i>'</i>t in it.

492
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,991
Maybe you and me better get
out of here, too.

493
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:16,116
Ain't much two of us can do.

494

Jet Younger, this fire, how far it could
be seen from up there in the hills.

498
00:40:42,042 --> 00:40:44,033
What are you trying to say, Dan?

499
00:40:44,167 --> 00:40:47,580
If the idea of this expedition was
to warn Jet we were comin',

500
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:51,200
so he could stay out of our way,
this is the place to build a fire.

501
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:53,949
Shucks!
You're just jumpin' to conclusions.

502
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:58,497
Maybe so. The first one is that Jet
is probably where he can see this fire.

503
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:03,198
Makes me remember there<i>'</i>s an old line
shack up there. Be a comfortable hideout.

504
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:06,200
- Look here, Dan...
- Better mix up some biscuits.

505
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:08,324
Are you...

506
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,538
- Well, I figure we better be on our way.
- Which way?

507
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:29,330
We'll turn back towards town,
look up them deputies first thing.

508
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:31,540
What about the line shack?

509
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:35,410
Now, Dan, I'm in charge of this party
and I say we go the other way.

510
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:39,450
I think I'll take a ride
towards the line shack.

511
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:54,366
You sure are a stubborn critter.

512
00:41:58,042 --> 00:42:00,249
I didn't hurt you, did I, Dan?

513
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:04,574
I did it for your own good, son.

514
00:42:04,708 --> 00:42:07,780
I couldn't stand
to see you get yourself shot up.

515
00:42:08,833 --> 00:42:13,827
Oh<i>,</i> what do we care about them
homesteaders or Jet Younger or anybody?

516
00:42:18,542 --> 00:42:20,533
Are you all right, Dan?

517
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:31,913
I'd rather have taken
the conk on my own head, son.

518
00:42:34,792 --> 00:42:37,625
There's no sense
in a man being so stubborn.

519

527
00:44:46,792 --> 00:44:49,408
Catched him, didn't you?

528
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:56,908
Hot today, ain<i>'</i>t it?

00:44:57,042 --> 00:45:00,034
Might rain before the end of the week,

530
00:45:00,167 --> 00:45:03,159
- Go away!
- Got any drinking water?

531
00:45:03,292 --> 00:45:06,910
Yeah. Plenty of it in the well.
You and your friend come on up.

532
00:45:07,042 --> 00:45:11,081
- He ain't no friend of mine.
- Sure we're friends. Do this every day.

535

That all depends.
One of the first rules of the game...

536
00:45:26,667 --> 00:45:30,660
Might be more profitable for you
to wait for me here, Bravo.

537
00:45:30,792 --> 00:45:35,741
Oh, I<i>'</i>ll just play a little bit. Maybe
show him something about the game.

538
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:40,699

fire, then go in the opposite direction.

- Security for my children.

00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:09,789
Be a long time
before he does any more outlawing.

663
00:58:09,917 --> 00:58:13,535
Figure he'll stay for weeks in jail
licking his wounds.

664
00:58:13,667 --> 00:58:17,114
Sheriff Trimble! Sheriff Trimble!
Jet Younger's escaped!

665
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:22,165
- Did you say Jet escaped?
- Shot his way out. Killed two men.

666
00:58:22,292 --> 00:58:26,285
- Took to the hills again, has he?
- No, he's still in town!

667
00:58:26,417 --> 00:58:30,239
- Has anyone notified Dan Mitchell?
- Dan?! You're the County Sheriff!

668
00:58:30,375 --> 00:58:33,287
That's just it - out of my jurisdiction.

669
00:58:33,417 --> 00:58:37,035
He was headed for the stables
when Dan cut him off.

670
00:58:37,167 --> 00:58:39,783
Off the streets. Come on, folks, hurry.

671
00:58:42,917 --> 00:58:45,249
(GUNFIRE)

672
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,582
There he is!

673
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,787
(SINGLE GUNSHOT)

674
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,117
She kept talking about you a lot at first.

675
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:48,287
- About me?
- Just rambling.

676
00:59:48,417 --> 00:59:52,410
Got the idea she's afraid of you.
Emotional upset, Doc said.

677
00:59:52,542 --> 00:59:56,740
Sort of upset myself,
come to think of it, all this killing.

678
00:59:56,875 --> 01:00:00,948
It ain't a part of the natural lives
of people like us.

679
01:00:01,083 --> 01:00:05,076
Maybe you were right, Dan,
about resigning.

680
01:00:05,208 --> 01:00:09,622
Had word from Charlie Fair today.
Ryker's on the trail again, be here soon.

681
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:11,866
I'll finish out my term, Ed.

682
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,494
Better think it over
while there's still a chance to pull out.

683
01:00:16,625 --> 01:00:20,948
I saw a motto on a sundial once. It said<i>,</i>
<i>'</i>'It<i>'</i>s always later than you think."

684
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:23,574
Good night, Ed.

685
01:00:23,708 --> 01:00:26,745
- Sherry...!
- I want to talk to Dan. Alone.

686
01:00:26,875 --> 01:00:29,491
- But Sherry...
- Please!

687
01:00:29,625 --> 01:00:31,832
Good night, Dan.

688
01:00:35,875 --> 01:00:37,706
Dan...

689
01:00:37,833 --> 01:00:40,575
There's something I want you to know.

690
01:00:42,208 --> 01:00:47,157
Ten years ago when Father first
brought me here, the very first day,

691
01:00:47,292 --> 01:00:52,867
I stood on Texas Street and I saw two
drunken trail hands fight it out with guns

692
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,161
until one was dead.

693
01:00:55,292 --> 01:00:57,704
I was ten years old

694
01:00:57,833 --> 01:01:02,156
and I saw a man's blood running in a
little stream into the gutter at my feet.

695
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:07,740
- That's been Abilene to me ever since.
- It won't be that way much longer.

696
01:01:07,875 --> 01:01:11,993
It<i>'</i>ll always be that way.
No one can ever change it. Don't you try.

697
01:01:12,125 --> 01:01:17,165
- Do you know what you're saying?
- Yes, I know. I'm saying I'm afraid.

698
01:01:17,292 --> 01:01:19,908
Afraid for myself and for you.

699
01:01:21,625 --> 01:01:24,537
Do you know how you terrify me?

700
01:01:24,667 --> 01:01:28,660
Every day I wonder if this is the day
I'll see you lying in the street...

701
01:01:28,792 --> 01:01:30,999
Sherry.

702
01:01:32,083 --> 01:01:34,119
Oh, Dan...

703
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:38,994
If you care anything about me at all,
take me away!

704
01:01:40,083 --> 01:01:44,281
Sherry, I... I wouldn<i>'</i>t be
any good to you running away.

705
01:01:44,417 --> 01:01:49,491
Being afraid would take
half the fun out of life for me.

706
01:01:49,625 --> 01:01:51,456
Fun?

707
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:56,656
Now I know what I saw in your eyes
when you killed Jet Younger.

708
01:01:56,792 --> 01:01:59,989
You didn't kill him
because you<i>'</i>re Marshal.

709
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:04,118
You wanted to see him
lying on the ground dead.

710
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:08,243
You keep this job because it's fun!
There's the killer in you, too!

711
01:02:08,375 --> 01:02:12,197
- Sherry<i>,</i> stop!
- Jet wasn't the first or the last.

712
01:02:12,333 --> 01:02:17,953
You want to run this town with a gun.
That's your life. And because it's fun!

713
01:02:18,083 --> 01:02:20,699
I'm running this town with my gun, Sherry,

714
01:02:20,833 --> 01:02:23,791
until I can turn it over
to gentler people.

715
01:02:23,917 --> 01:02:27,705
I don't believe you! There<i>'</i>s no gentleness
in you. Not even a hope for it.

716
01:02:27,833 --> 01:02:32,623
Do just one thing for us
and for yourself - resign.

717
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,947
Please! Please, resign!

718
01:02:37,083 --> 01:02:39,290
And go away!

719
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:05,163
That's right, Jim.
We've all got to stick together.

720
01:03:05,292 --> 01:03:09,911
That's the purpose of this organisation.
To stick together. And to fight.

721
01:03:10,042 --> 01:03:12,533
We want peace, Henry.

722
01:03:12,667 --> 01:03:17,081
So did those people
who were killed by Jet Younger.

723
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:21,622
We<i>'</i>ve got over 400 family in this county
and there's more coming.

724
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:24,082
We're getting dangerous
to the trail herds.

725
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:28,406
Henry's right. The townspeople figure
if they're decent to us

726
01:03:28,542 --> 01:03:31,079
the trail hands will take it out on them.

727
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:35,121
It'll be a fine country round here...
if we're strong.

728
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:37,081
(MURMURS)

729
01:03:37,208 --> 01:03:41,781
Well, I guess we've had enough talk.
Our first job is cutting those fenceposts.

730
01:03:41,917 --> 01:03:45,739
We'll start stringing wire
across the trail when they're in.

731
01:03:45,875 --> 01:03:50,790
- Across the cattle trail?
- It crosses our land. We've got a right.

732
01:03:50,917 --> 01:03:53,499
Come on! Let<i>'</i>s get at it!

733
01:04:08,417 --> 01:04:11,033
Thank you<i>,</i> Mrs Lind.

734
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:21,539
- I want some barbed wire, Mr Balder.
- Barbed wire? How much?

735
01:04:21,667 --> 01:04:24,659
- 400 spools.
- What are you going to do?

736
01:04:24,792 --> 01:04:29,286
You're in business, aren<i>'</i>t you? There's
the money. It's all you get to ask for.

737
01:04:29,417 --> 01:04:34,832
I<i>'</i>m not asking for anything. I can<i>'</i>t sell
dynamite to a fool - or a half-grown boy.

738
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:39,452
There are old men asking for it.
Fine old men, and women and children.

739
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:44,122
Haven<i>'</i>t got any, Mr Dreiser.
Leastways, none for sale.

740
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:46,241
But Mr Balder...

741
01:04:57,042 --> 01:05:01,536
- Er, you got a minute, Miss Balder?
- What do you want, Mr Dreiser?

742
01:05:01,667 --> 01:05:06,206
Your father refused to sell me barbed
wire. I need it to protect our land.

743
01:05:06,333 --> 01:05:08,949
More fighting and killing?

744
01:05:09,083 --> 01:05:11,699
Do I look like a man who likes killing?

745
01:05:16,875 --> 01:05:21,539
Wire. Just to mark off the place
I want to work hard the rest of my life.

746
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:23,658
Is that a crime?

747
01:05:23,792 --> 01:05:25,623
No.

748
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:28,162
Why is it so important to you?

749
01:05:28,292 --> 01:05:31,739
Because I want what my father didn't have. Land.

750
01:05:31,875 --> 01:05:35,823
Growing wheat, enough of it
to raise a fine family in peace.

751
01:05:35,958 --> 01:05:38,370
Is that a poor thing to want?

752
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,331
No.

753
01:05:40,458 --> 01:05:42,665
No, it<i>'</i>s not a poor thing.

754
01:05:44,625 --> 01:05:47,116
What are you hanging on to so hard?

755
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:50,868
What's a girl like you got here
that you can be proud of?

756
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,822
We<i>'</i>re the only ones that can give you
a life worth living. You know that.

757
01:05:54,958 --> 01:05:58,780
- If they let you.
- They will. We're strong enough now.

758
01:05:58,917 --> 01:06:02,990
- For more bloodshed?
- Or be wiped out. What'll you do then?

759
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:07,368
- I know you. I've been watching you...
- Watching me?

760
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:12,199
Well, yes, I...
I have a little, now and then.

761
01:06:13,875 --> 01:06:18,869
You're like us, Sherry. A lot like us.
You want the same things that we do.

762
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,198
You know, we got a lot in common.
We're what this country can be, Sherry.

763
01:06:23,333 --> 01:06:27,906
And we can have it. All you have to do
is tell me where that wire's kept.

764
01:06:28,042 --> 01:06:32,456
I'll be back with wagons to haul it.
Here<i>'</i>s the money. Give us a chance.

765
01:06:33,458 --> 01:06:35,449
You and me.

766

(WHISTLES AND SHOUTS)

767
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:38,951
Barbed wire ahead across the trail
as far as you can see.

768
01:07:39,083 --> 01:07:44,032
No farmer can block my trail.
Drive right through it!

(YELLING)

770
01:09:28,792 --> 01:09:30,783
- What<i>'</i>s that?
- Cattle!

771
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:17,573
- Ryker?
- Hit the fences. Stampeded the cattle.

772
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:24,702
Take them inside, get Doc Sanders.
Lend a hand, boys. Come inside, Henry.

773
01:10:30,833 --> 01:10:33,324
Hannaberry is dead.

774
01:10:33,458 --> 01:10:35,449
Bob Rankin.

775
01:10:35,583 --> 01:10:37,574
The Freeman family.

776
01:10:37,708 --> 01:10:40,575
Wait a minute. Where were those fences?

777
01:10:40,708 --> 01:10:45,327
- Across the trail.
- The cattle trail? You put fences...?!

778
01:10:45,458 --> 01:10:49,280
- Yes!
- You can't do that. Where'd you get wire?

779
01:10:49,417 --> 01:10:54,036
- Ryker will come for who sold the wire.
- That's not all he'll come for.

780
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:58,160
- Where are the rest of the homesteaders?
- I said to meet at the bend of the river.

781
01:10:58,292 --> 01:11:02,911
Get them in town before dark,
while there still is a town.

782
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:21,245
- Which way are you shooting, Charlie?
- Me? I'm in the saloon business.

783
01:11:21,375 --> 01:11:25,368
- I'm giving you an hour to close up.
- Now wait a minute...

784
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:29,493
There'll be no drunken trail hands
stampeding this town tonight.

785
01:11:29,625 --> 01:11:33,618
Maybe you haven't heard.
The trail's closed for good.

786
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:39,165
- From what I hear, it's wide open again.
- Charlie, get out while you can.

787
01:11:39,292 --> 01:11:43,285
Seems to me you need that chance
more than I do, Marshal.

788
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:54,039
Seven people killed
and $6,000 in property damaged.

789
01:11:54,167 --> 01:11:58,160
- This is another Gettysburg.
- Who sold them that wire?

790
01:11:58,292 --> 01:12:02,331
- Not me. I turned them down.
- Well, your wire shed is empty.

791
01:12:02,458 --> 01:12:07,282
I sold that wire. Henry Dreiser said
he wanted it to prevent any trouble.

792
01:12:07,417 --> 01:12:10,830
Didn't you know better than to trust
a homesteader?

793
01:12:10,958 --> 01:12:16,498
And why shouldn<i>'</i>t I trust a homesteader?
They<i>'</i>re people like us. Better.

794
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:19,162
Do they come here with guns bristling?

795
01:12:19,292 --> 01:12:22,329
They'll make life here worth living.

796
01:12:22,458 --> 01:12:25,950
They didn't know crazy trail hands
would stampede cattle.

797
01:12:26,083 --> 01:12:29,496
Well, they got what's coming to them.
But what about us?

798
01:12:35,292 --> 01:12:39,911
- Why did those homesteaders move here?
- Mind if I say something?

799
01:12:40,042 --> 01:12:45,082
Boys, I'd think it over carefully.
Whatever happens here will spread.

800
01:12:45,208 --> 01:12:49,827
This is a fight for the state of Kansas,
which way the country's going.

801
01:12:49,958 --> 01:12:53,951
- Better be sure you pick your friends.
- What's a few homesteaders worth?

802
01:12:54,083 --> 01:12:57,655
- Not much, but 1, 000 are worth a lot.
- There<i>'</i>s not that many.

803
01:12:57,792 --> 01:13:02,991
Henry Dreiser has 100 men in his
association and he's only 25% organised.

804
01:13:03,125 --> 01:13:06,947
How many people is that<i>,</i> Ed,
figuring three to a family?

805
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:12,373
- It<i>'</i>s... over a thousand!
- But suppose Ryker drives them away?

806
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:17,369
- I think you can discount that rumour.
- You're not tangling with him again?!

807
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:22,745
There were people killed this afternoon.
Makes my position pretty clear.

808
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:27,581
Dan...

809
01:13:27,708 --> 01:13:32,498
When I sold Henry that wire, I didn't
realise it'd come tumbling down on you.

810
01:13:32,625 --> 01:13:36,368
Funny, you never know
who's going to fire the first shot.

811
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,491
400 families.

812
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:43,790
If each family spent, say, $500 a year
here in town, how much business is that?

813
01:13:43,917 --> 01:13:48,536
- Almost... a quarter of a million dollars.
- How much do the trail hands spend?

814
01:13:48,667 --> 01:13:53,081
Now if 400 only spend
$300 a year...

815
01:13:53,208 --> 01:13:55,745
lf, if, if! I know what I<i>'</i>m gonna do.

816
01:13:55,875 --> 01:14:00,448
I'm gonna get word to Ryker
that Dan don't represent me. I am neutral.

817
01:14:00,583 --> 01:14:03,780
- I don<i>'</i>t want any part of this fight.
- Quiet!

818
01:14:03,917 --> 01:14:08,115
Suppose in a year from now
there are 800 families here.

819
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:13,199
That's half a million dollars!
Half a million dollars. And no shootin'.

820
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:17,155
But suppose the homesteaders
are wiped out?

821
01:14:23,458 --> 01:14:25,449
(MUSIC FROM SALOONS)

822
01:14:53,542 --> 01:14:56,739
Turn out the lights, Ned. Street<i>'</i>s closed.

823
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:05,661
(MUSIC STOPS)

824
01:15:26,875 --> 01:15:29,082
(LIVELY DANCE MUSIC)

825
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:37,368
Will you turn them out, Pete,
or you want me to?

826
01:15:45,417 --> 01:15:50,036
- Dan... I got word to the men.
- When will they be here?

827
01:15:50,167 --> 01:15:54,581
- As fast as they can get together.
- Wait here.

828
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:05,116
(MUSIC STOPS)

829
01:16:10,542 --> 01:16:12,749
Stay here, Jip.

830
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:18,244
My people are mad<i>,</i> Dan.
Everybody loved old man Hannaberry.

831
01:16:19,958 --> 01:16:23,371
- Evening, Marshal.
- Evening, Jake.

832
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:32,164
They want to settle this once and for all,
make this the last fight.

833
01:16:32,292 --> 01:16:34,783
I think it will be, Henry.

834
01:16:37,458 --> 01:16:40,291
# I'm just brimming over with zest

835
01:16:40,417 --> 01:16:43,614
# Because I love it out in the West

836
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:46,366
# I love it out here in the West

837
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:49,697
# Because the West is best for lovin'

838
01:16:49,833 --> 01:16:54,031
# When the stars are shining
and the moon is gold

839
01:16:54,167 --> 01:16:58,615
# You'll find me out with my Romeo
Back East I was always repressed

840
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:01,457
# That's why I love it out in... #

841
01:17:01,583 --> 01:17:05,576
You sure would have looked nice
in a kitchen apron.

842
01:17:05,708 --> 01:17:09,906
What do you mean, stopping the show?!
I own this place and give the orders.

843
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:14,206
- Tell them to turn out the lights.
- Grab him, boys.

844
01:17:14,333 --> 01:17:16,665
Look out, Dan!

845
01:17:19,667 --> 01:17:21,658
Lights out, Charlie.

846
01:17:22,875 --> 01:17:25,366
Do you want me to do it for you?

847
01:17:33,583 --> 01:17:38,373
- You'll set the place on fire!
- I wouldn't want to do that.

848
01:17:39,375 --> 01:17:40,990
Wait!

849
01:17:43,667 --> 01:17:45,999
Lights out.

850
01:18:09,417 --> 01:18:14,241
I came to tell you to pack up.
Maybe breaking it up is a better idea.

851
01:18:14,375 --> 01:18:17,697
- You're not closing me up!
- Listen, Rita,

852
01:18:17,833 --> 01:18:20,245
it's going to be rough, not safe.

853
01:18:20,375 --> 01:18:25,369
Don't you tell me what's safe, you big
blond baboon! Wait 'til Ryker gets here!

854
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:31,993
- The jig's up.
- It sure is, but not for me.

855
01:18:32,125 --> 01:18:36,164
Who's going to stand with you?
The merchants? The homesteaders?

856
01:18:36,292 --> 01:18:39,409
You<i>'</i>ll look like a duck
in a shooting gallery.

857
01:18:39,542 --> 01:18:42,158
The tame always win, Rita.

858
01:18:42,292 --> 01:18:46,911
This will fall around your lovely ears,
dollar by dollar, dime by dime.

859
01:18:47,042 --> 01:18:51,240
Get out of here before I kill you!
And I don't mean half kill you!

860
01:18:51,375 --> 01:18:55,869
This is my property paid for with my
money. If you ever set foot in here again

861
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,413
I'll beat your brains out,
you brainless idiot!

862
01:19:04,083 --> 01:19:08,156
- Suppose 1, 000 families spend $300...
- Here they come!

863
01:19:23,167 --> 01:19:25,658
Hey, Cap, look.

864
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:34,540
- What's the idea, saloons being closed?
- New law. Went into effect tonight.

865
01:19:34,667 --> 01:19:37,374
You think you can stop us?

866
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:41,662
You got a pretty strong outfit.

867
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:48,074
Boys, anybody want to get
the trail dust out of their throats?

868
01:19:48,208 --> 01:19:50,199
(WHOOPING)

869
01:20:03,833 --> 01:20:09,032
Won't take them long to get liquored up
and start on this side of the street.

870
01:20:09,167 --> 01:20:13,365
Hey, Captain! Captain Ryker!
I'm sure glad to see you.

871
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:17,914
- Let him close you up, did you?
- Oh, now<i>,</i> Captain, look...

872
01:20:18,042 --> 01:20:21,239
All right, boys. Take it. Let's go!

873

(WHOOPING AND FIRING)

874
01:20:35,458 --> 01:20:37,244
Sherry!

875
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:41,197
- Are they coming?
- I hope so. They could be too late.

876
01:20:41,333 --> 01:20:46,202
I understand you told them about selling
us the wire and that you believed in us.

877
01:20:46,333 --> 01:20:48,369
I believe in you.

878
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:56,323
- Let a cattleman show you how, son.
- What do you mean...?!

879
01:21:05,667 --> 01:21:08,079
Nice work.

880
01:21:08,208 --> 01:21:12,030
- I didn't mean to hit him so hard.
- How do you feel?

881
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:14,078
Fine.

882
01:21:14,208 --> 01:21:18,406
- Oh, Dan!
- Sherry, I<i>'</i>m proud of you.

883
01:21:18,542 --> 01:21:21,124
I'm proud of you, Dan.

884
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:24,447
And Henry. And me, too.

885
01:21:24,583 --> 01:21:27,199
It's getting pretty rough down there, Dan.

886
01:21:27,333 --> 01:21:32,157
She<i>'</i>s a wonderful girl, Henry. Get her out
of here before I take her away from you.

887
01:21:32,292 --> 01:21:35,910
- Take her away? You mean...
- Exactly.

888
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:40,291
Come on, Henry. I'll explain it to you.

889
01:21:41,292 --> 01:21:43,578
(FIRING CONTINUES)

890
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:53,457
What are you doing out there?

891
01:21:53,583 --> 01:21:57,622
Somebody has to protect the Sheriff's
office! Where are you fixin' to go?

892
01:21:57,750 --> 01:22:02,244
A fella's been losing some sheep.
He wants me to investigate it.

893
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:04,787
Hm! Sheep(!)

894
01:22:15,833 --> 01:22:21,157
Maybe we're making a mistake, Henry.
Why help a town that don't want us?

895
01:22:21,292 --> 01:22:22,407
Afraid?

896
01:22:22,542 --> 01:22:27,787
No, ma<i>'</i>am. We're not afraid. We just
don't quite know what this is all about.

897
01:22:27,917 --> 01:22:32,115
It's about drunken trail hands
that don<i>'</i>t want you to settle your land,

898
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:36,869
it<i>'</i>s about farms and homes and a fool
marshal who's got himself in a corner

899

because he knows better times are comin'.

900
01:22:39,917 --> 01:22:43,910
- In this town?
- Not this town. It's the right to live.

901
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:48,866
- What's going on here?
- Here's Sheriff Trimble come to lead you!

902

- What<i>'</i>s that?
- Must be at least 300 votes here.

903
01:22:52,625 --> 01:22:56,914
- I gotta see a man about a sheep.
- You captured Jet Younger!

904
01:22:57,042 --> 01:23:01,536
- Yeah, well, I had a hand in it.
- Well, we<i>'</i>ll follow you, Sheriff!

905
01:23:01,667 --> 01:23:04,158

- Glad you<i>'</i>re here<i>,</i> boys.
- What'll we do?

914
01:23:52,542 --> 01:23:56,581
Fan out, take up positions around
the stores and buildings on that side.

915
01:23:56,708 --> 01:24:00,906
- Hear that, fellas? Spread out!
- Over there, boys. On that side.

916
01:24:01,042 --> 01:24:06,537
- What's Ryker's men up to now?
- Hitting the saloons and gambling houses.

917
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:11,366
- And you ain't doing nothin' about it?
- Not me. They're doing too good a job.

918
01:24:13,958 --> 01:24:16,495
It's scary. Sure is.

This is my place!
You don<i>'</i>t want to rip up my place!

921
01:24:37,833 --> 01:24:39,824
Aww, get off of me!

922
01:24:45,042 --> 01:24:49,832
Look! Look, Marshal! Why don't you
do something? Why don't you stop it?

923
01:24:49,958 --> 01:24:54,247
There's a $ 10, 000 riot going on in there!
What are you for?

924
01:24:54,375 --> 01:24:59,119
You're the man that wanted an open town.
Well, here it is, Charlie. Wide open.

925

Circle Bar! Johnny Jones! Circle Bar!
Come on, boys!

926
01:25:44,958 --> 01:25:48,951
- Had enough fun, Ryker?
- When I have, I'll find more.

927
01:25:49,083 --> 01:25:52,996
If your boys try to cross the street,
they'll find our men waiting.

928
01:25:54,125 --> 01:25:56,707
I'll take my boys anywhere I want to go.

929
01:25:56,833 --> 01:26:01,452
You<i>'</i>re not taking them anywhere, Ryker.
You're coming with me.

930

- I am?
- Yes.

931
01:26:04,792 --> 01:26:08,080
You're under arrest. The charge is murder.

- My dresses...!
- Leave <i>'</i>em.

are kitchen aprons.

(WHOOPING CONTINUES)

936

Come on, men, let's burn the town!
Get the merchants<i>'</i> stores!

937
01:26:57,333 --> 01:26:59,949
What am I doing here?!

938
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:12,616
Hold it!

939
01:27:16,625 --> 01:27:19,742
We<i>'</i>ve had enough trouble. It's over now.

940
01:27:19,875 --> 01:27:22,412
Where's Cap? Where's Ryker?

941
01:27:22,542 --> 01:27:27,991
Ryker's dead. So is your part of Abilene.
All that's left of it is the trail back.

942
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,537
Boys, this is the way a tough street dies.

943
01:27:31,667 --> 01:27:34,534
Not with a roar, but with a whine.

944
01:27:34,667 --> 01:27:37,329
You don't want to die here with it.

945
01:27:37,458 --> 01:27:41,827
The tame are taking over Abilene
and they're tougher than you think.

946
01:27:41,958 --> 01:27:43,949
Better ride, boys.

947
01:27:48,625 --> 01:27:50,866
Let them ride out of town.

948
01:28:03,708 --> 01:28:08,532
I don't know whether you joined us or we
joined you, but it's good to be together.

949
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:29,912
Well, we sure done it.

950
01:28:45,458 --> 01:28:49,656
All right, but remember one thing -
no beard.

951
01:28:51,667 --> 01:28:56,331
- You know what I was thinking, Annie?
- There's time for one game of fan-tan.

952
01:29:00,292 --> 01:29:02,783
Hey, you play fan-tan?

953
01:29:10,083 --> 01:29:12,745
Dan, how about a little fan-tan?

954
01:29:14,917 --> 01:29:17,454
Just one little game, Annie.
