176
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:22,647
Warning: Frankie back to Hollywood!

177
00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:25,327
- Dude, I pray.
- This guy is you!

178
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:31,927
- Bend it does not break.
- You'll bend it. I'll put it tonight.

179
00:17:52,727 --> 00:17:54,607
Yes, drink baby!
Take it all!

180
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,647
Eat it for me!

181
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:58,807
Hey, what are you doing,
haxerilor?

182
00:17:58,927 --> 00:18:01,527
Coconut Pete's coming!

183
00:18:05,727 --> 00:18:07,767
Hey, amigo.
You must be Lars.

184
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:12,047
Coconut Pete. Hey, man, I appreciate that
put me in your circle of apropiaþi.

185
00:18:12,127 --> 00:18:14,727
Pleasure is mine.
I've heard good things about your fingers.

186
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:18,527
This is a shirt to keep quiet?

187
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:21,047
Yes it is. It is the same as that
that you wore on the cover.

188
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:24,007
"Pink Crustaceans and Good Vibraþions?

189
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,047
I read an interview
1977 when you said that ...

190
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:28,527
Hold up the blue
concentrated in hard times.

191
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,687
In this park, I said it in '77.

192
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:33,687
I think nobody would you get said, but ...

193
00:18:33,807 --> 00:18:36,047
would have to wear special jersey to work.

194
00:18:36,127 --> 00:18:38,807
Yes, but it's pretty warm here and i. ..

195
00:18:38,927 --> 00:18:40,807
wet foot-cam

196
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:43,927
Put that on your misfortune.
Hank, Lars gives them a hand, will you?

197
00:18:44,047 --> 00:18:45,967
Yes.

198
00:18:48,087 --> 00:18:49,087
Thanks, Hank.

199
00:18:58,447 --> 00:19:01,247
Coco Pete, I have a gift
for you, buddy.

200
00:19:01,327 --> 00:19:04,767
See that flower in the yellow dress?

201
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:06,887
It also flourished.

202
00:19:07,007 --> 00:19:10,487
He said that you saw in Tucson
3 years ago, row 14.

203
00:19:15,007 --> 00:19:18,727
Excuse me, but have not been to one of
my shows?

204
00:19:18,847 --> 00:19:21,167
U of A, '99?

205
00:19:21,287 --> 00:19:23,407
- Yes!
- I remember you, you were ...

206
00:19:23,527 --> 00:19:27,047
Do not tell me row 15.

207
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:31,767
- Row 14!
- I have photographic memory of beautiful faces.

208
00:19:31,847 --> 00:19:34,807
How about a tour?

209
00:19:34,887 --> 00:19:37,687
- Yes, definitely.
- Right.

210
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:43,447
Hey, buddy!

211
00:19:43,527 --> 00:19:46,487
Jesus!
This is tequila!

212
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:50,127
I was his partner Andre Agassi
entire week.

213
00:19:50,207 --> 00:19:53,047
I've learned it on 'Dre
Cocks and Quarters to sing.

214
00:19:53,127 --> 00:19:57,087
But he never sang
Cocks and Quarters.

215
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:59,727
How interesting.

216
00:19:59,807 --> 00:20:01,887
- Yes it is ... Well, it's ...
- Hey, bunny!

217
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,087
- Give me a Drambuie, clean.
- Vine.

218
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:08,487
All alone, right? Giving you no worries.
"No woman, no cry," right?

219
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:12,127
In fact until I was almost engaged to
you come here as a hooligan.

220
00:20:12,207 --> 00:20:14,967
Yes, I've heard.
Something about, Cocks and Quarters?

221
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,327
We have this game and we in the States but here
Hide the Sausage say it.

222
00:20:18,407 --> 00:20:22,087
Pardon?
Excuse me, do not serve minors that.

223
00:20:22,207 --> 00:20:24,927
Let me, if the grass field
play up.

224
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:27,847
Right, Governor?
Hey, Sammy, stay away!

225
00:20:31,207 --> 00:20:33,887
Mmm!
Gracias, AND erif.

226
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:35,967
Legalize it!

227
00:20:38,847 --> 00:20:41,127
Hey, the campfire entertainment.

228
00:20:41,247 --> 00:20:44,367
- And do not forget condom îþi.
- Tequila! Who else wants?

229
00:20:44,487 --> 00:20:47,367
Hey, you dance alone?
Hey, baby, come here.

230
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,127
Hi!

231
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:53,327
We declare Mr. and Mrs. Ameþiþi!

232
00:20:53,447 --> 00:20:55,767
I're in debt, suriorule.

233
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:58,687
Can I kiss the bride?

234
00:20:58,767 --> 00:21:02,007
- Do you work here?
- Yes.

235
00:21:02,087 --> 00:21:05,647
I am Juan Castillo.
I'm diving instructor.

236
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:07,927
I mean, rock-

237
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:12,527
Rocks, stones, plates.
What do you want.

238
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:16,487
It's a beautiful name.
"Peenalop."

239
00:21:16,607 --> 00:21:20,007
Peenalop.
It is baffling.

240
00:21:20,127 --> 00:21:23,047
Thanks.

241
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:27,127
What brings you here with us, Peenalop?

242
00:21:27,247 --> 00:21:31,087
I am on vacation for spring.
I go to Oral Roberts.

243
00:21:31,247 --> 00:21:35,007
Oral Roberts?
And it is like Anal Johnson?

244
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:37,607
I did this a few times.

245
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:42,727
Or I think of Dirty Sanchez?
He is.

246
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:47,367
- I do not know what it is.
- It is not for you.

247
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:50,607
- God!
- Yes.

248
00:21:50,687 --> 00:21:52,767
A magical place.

249
00:22:08,007 --> 00:22:11,287
- Hey.
- Hey, Carlos.

250
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:13,887
Quickly.
We have many plates.

251
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:56,847
Dreacu of monkeys.

252
00:23:12,327 --> 00:23:14,407
You?

253
00:23:14,487 --> 00:23:18,127
Carlos, these knives are dirty.
When we cureþi?

254
00:23:18,247 --> 00:23:20,087
Tomorrow.

255
00:23:49,607 --> 00:23:52,767
1.2!
1,2,3,4!

256
00:24:21,207 --> 00:24:23,047
- Welcome!
- Move to.

257
00:24:23,127 --> 00:24:25,207
Sing "Margaritaville."

258
00:24:28,847 --> 00:24:30,567
Pardon?

259
00:24:30,647 --> 00:24:34,327
Sing "Margaritaville."
I love that song.

260
00:24:34,447 --> 00:24:37,847
I think you mean to
sing "Up Coladaburg."

261
00:24:37,967 --> 00:24:40,527
No, "Margaritaville." "

262
00:24:43,087 --> 00:24:45,967
I mean "Before Coladaburg."

263
00:24:46,087 --> 00:24:49,247
A song I made
half seven years ago ...

264
00:24:49,327 --> 00:24:52,087
before "Margaritaville"
appear!

265
00:24:52,207 --> 00:24:55,287
Of course it could not because you're ...

266
00:24:55,407 --> 00:24:57,287
you are not yet born!

267
00:24:57,367 --> 00:24:59,287
Come on.
Let's take a drink.

268
00:24:59,407 --> 00:25:01,287
- I do not need shit.
- Come on, man.

269
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:03,327
Dreacu take it!
Dog sow!

270
00:25:06,767 --> 00:25:09,607
Hey, Jenny.

271
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:14,607
- God!
- Sorry.

272
00:25:14,727 --> 00:25:16,727
Notifies me before you do that.

273
00:25:16,847 --> 00:25:20,127
It is a habit.
I saw that you're remote tense.

274
00:25:20,207 --> 00:25:22,207
What can I say?
Some girls are "tight" than others.

275
00:25:24,847 --> 00:25:27,127
Sorry.

276
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:31,207
I guess talk to a celebrity.

277
00:25:31,287 --> 00:25:32,887
Felecitãri.
I heard you show your fitness?

278
00:25:33,007 --> 00:25:37,087
Yes. Amy ate the Aerobics
mistake and rat poison.

279
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:39,287
It was terrible.

280
00:25:39,407 --> 00:25:42,607
But I'm excited.
Am very much expected that.

281
00:25:42,727 --> 00:25:44,967
- That's great.
- Jen.

282
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:49,367
I had to stop and enjoy being forced to
never do that.

283
00:25:49,487 --> 00:25:51,367
Yes, I think it is difficult
You're to live in paradise.

284
00:25:51,447 --> 00:25:53,887
Yes.
Do you like now but later ...

285
00:25:59,927 --> 00:26:03,167
Hey, you want to hear the story maniac
with machetes?

286
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,447
Let's hear it.

287
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:10,367
I do not know.
Maybe that's too hard for you.

288
00:26:10,447 --> 00:26:14,487
- No. No, no.
- No, let me, Dave. Tell us the story.

289
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:17,287
Well, why not.

290
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:20,087
That happened 15 years ago.

291
00:26:20,207 --> 00:26:23,527
I was a boy who worked
the club, Phil Coletti.

292
00:26:23,607 --> 00:26:27,687
And on a night-
that's about

293
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:31,207
a beautiful woman enters the club,
and asks if he wants to go in the jungle.

294
00:26:31,287 --> 00:26:33,487
He says, "Yes, why not?"

295
00:26:33,607 --> 00:26:37,007
And go.
And whereas in the jungle ...

296
00:26:37,127 --> 00:26:40,607
lights are removed from the club ...

297
00:26:40,727 --> 00:26:42,847
start to put all sorts of questions ...

298
00:26:42,927 --> 00:26:46,607
believes that if local stories ...

299
00:26:46,727 --> 00:26:49,127
with voodoo, zombies.

300
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:52,647
He and i do not really worry.

301
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:54,687
She climbs on and starts, and his job.

302
00:26:54,767 --> 00:26:58,967
But something does not seem out of place Colette.

303
00:26:59,087 --> 00:27:02,847
But I do not see anything.
It was dark and I and sees the job.

304
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:05,047
But then, boom!

305
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:09,607
A lightning illuminates the island and
at that moment ...

306
00:27:09,687 --> 00:27:14,287
Coletti looks around and sees that there
only that it was in the middle of the cemetery ...

307
00:27:14,407 --> 00:27:18,447
and that others were watching him ...

308
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:21,647
but sees that making love to a corpse.

309
00:27:23,407 --> 00:27:25,447
One cold, dirty ...

310
00:27:25,527 --> 00:27:29,047
and from the pit.

311
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:31,807
And they say that ...

312
00:27:31,887 --> 00:27:35,487
Phil Coletti he went calm
hut attendant tombs ...

313
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:37,327
has found a machete ...

314
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,927
and cut off hundreds of pieces members.

315
00:27:42,247 --> 00:27:45,647
And they say took that same machete ...

316
00:27:45,767 --> 00:27:49,807
and has cut his own dick and
ran screaming through the jungles.

317
00:27:49,927 --> 00:27:53,127
No one had seen him after that.

318
00:27:53,207 --> 00:27:55,247
But from then on ...

319
00:27:55,367 --> 00:27:58,687
Phil Coletti was known as ...

320
00:27:58,807 --> 00:28:01,247
Machete Phil.

321
00:28:01,327 --> 00:28:05,647
You're saying a damblagiu
now through our walk around?

322
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:09,407
All I'm saying is that I'm not going
alone in the jungle.

323
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:12,887
Because you can hear
I have heard ...

324
00:28:13,007 --> 00:28:15,687
complaining ...

325
00:28:15,767 --> 00:28:19,647
"Where is my penis?

326
00:28:19,767 --> 00:28:24,407
Where is my penis? "

327
00:28:24,527 --> 00:28:27,007
And that was me!

328
00:28:38,807 --> 00:28:41,007
You're an asshole,
Putman.

329
00:28:43,047 --> 00:28:45,647
- And someone has put it tonight?
- Hey, Pete.

330
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:47,887
I did.

331
00:28:48,007 --> 00:28:50,167
He saw someone
Rolo, Stacy or Kelly?

332
00:28:50,287 --> 00:28:52,287
And probably through the jungle fuck there.

333
00:28:52,407 --> 00:28:55,327
I need someone to
Luau Night take care of tomorrow.

334
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:58,847
Yeah, sure.
I drive Luau Night.

335
00:28:58,927 --> 00:29:01,407
What, a few Anana and i.

336
00:29:01,487 --> 00:29:04,167
- Yes, great. Sam, you want Luau Night?
- Sure.

337
00:29:04,247 --> 00:29:07,047
You'll have the grass skirts, play a game ...

338
00:29:07,127 --> 00:29:09,327
and all and I will make.

339
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:12,407
That sounds good.
Folks.

340
00:29:12,527 --> 00:29:15,207
Asking too much?
Make your invitations for sex.

341
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:17,767
Not all the shows and the bad.

342
00:29:27,287 --> 00:29:28,527
Hola, Peenalop!

343
00:30:55,047 --> 00:30:57,247
Change!

344
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:08,407
- Well, 200 points.
- God!

345
00:31:08,527 --> 00:31:11,127
You're dead, labex! Puþulicã!

346
00:31:11,247 --> 00:31:14,247
You've burned!

347
00:31:14,527 --> 00:31:15,927

359
00:32:03,607 --> 00:32:06,127
Shit.

360
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:11,607
Well, yes.

Shit!

364
00:32:44,727 --> 00:32:48,327
Gotcha!

365
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,807
Hello?

366
00:34:08,327 --> 00:34:10,567
Hello?

367
00:34:26,487 --> 00:34:27,487
Lars?

368
00:34:28,527 --> 00:34:32,407
Sorry.
I was in the middle of my Chi Kung exercise.

369
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,687
Qi Kung?

370
00:34:35,447 --> 00:34:37,887
You have to have the show.

371
00:34:37,967 --> 00:34:39,767
I guess doing and
more than massage, right?

372
00:34:39,807 --> 00:34:40,847
Yes, that is ...

373
00:34:40,927 --> 00:34:44,047
Working on the body is my life,
but we have done and Dianetics.

374
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:45,807
I spent some time in the forums.

375
00:34:45,927 --> 00:34:48,607
I did a little Falun Gong Chow Bang.

376
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:50,847
- You know who has a good philosophy?
- Who?

377
00:34:50,927 --> 00:34:53,007
Coconut Pete.

378
00:34:53,127 --> 00:34:54,927
It always feels good.

379
00:34:55,047 --> 00:34:57,247
- It is always first.
- Absolutely.

380
00:34:57,327 --> 00:35:00,967
Sign on our asses!

381
00:35:01,047 --> 00:35:03,647
- What do you think about Feng Chi?
- Nothing.

382
00:35:06,567 --> 00:35:08,647
Panda snoring.

383
00:35:08,727 --> 00:35:11,247
Do not be confused with Linou Gano ...

384
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:13,087
- Leaking Turtle.
- God!

385
00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:15,807
- Do not try this in public.
- Dude!

386
00:35:15,887 --> 00:35:17,807
Hey, you guys will send you there.

Go.

00:35:23,567 --> 00:35:25,527
- Come on, jump!
- It's amazing.

390
00:35:25,647 --> 00:35:27,687
It's all about connecting internally.

391
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:30,567
We all have energy in us and
is linked at some buttons.

392
00:35:30,647 --> 00:35:33,047
And you can press buttons?

393
00:35:33,127 --> 00:35:35,487
Tian ... Tu.

394
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:38,927
The Heaven Point.

395
00:35:39,047 --> 00:35:43,047
Take me to hell!

396
00:35:43,127 --> 00:35:46,207
Damn!

397
00:35:46,287 --> 00:35:48,527
Maybe I should take you home with me.

398
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:52,287
I do not think I held in my bag.
Shit!

399
00:35:52,367 --> 00:35:55,647
What the hell?
Lord!

400
00:35:55,727 --> 00:35:57,847

401
00:35:57,967 --> 00:36:00,207
- You'll be fine.
- No pulse.

402
00:36:02,607 --> 00:36:04,847
"Naughty Carlos'?

403
00:36:06,767 --> 00:36:09,647
Who's driving the boat?

404
00:36:11,247 --> 00:36:13,167
You have played this game as a child?

405
00:36:13,287 --> 00:36:17,127
I had a cheaper version of Nicaraguan
Circle called Eater.

406
00:36:17,247 --> 00:36:20,607
But, you know-

407
00:36:20,687 --> 00:36:23,727
Trying to tell us something?
Timmy is stuck in the wall?

408
00:36:23,847 --> 00:36:25,887
Hai!

409
00:36:25,967 --> 00:36:28,567

- Supervises the banana!

410
00:36:34,887 --> 00:36:37,887
Dude!

411
00:36:37,967 --> 00:36:39,727
Cliff!

412
00:36:50,087 --> 00:36:52,567
Who would do to something like that?

413
00:36:52,647 --> 00:36:55,047
Ie and mother who would dreacu
come here and would make a something like that?

414
00:36:56,327 --> 00:36:58,927
Okay, calm down.

415
00:36:59,047 --> 00:37:01,927
- Do not make any scene.
- It is a killer and on the island.

416
00:37:01,967 --> 00:37:06,207
I know who he is. The Machete Phil,
and to exit it in the jungle.

417
00:37:06,287 --> 00:37:08,567
Doors resin, Juanny. You know that this is
Guest notes a shit story.

418
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:11,327
Hey, it seems that others are better.

419
00:37:11,407 --> 00:37:14,327
But to see what someone did to me
and the plan of activities.

420
00:37:14,407 --> 00:37:17,007
Oh, God!

421
00:37:25,967 --> 00:37:28,167
"Do your own business and trãiþi.

422
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:30,407
Tell the muriþi Guest notes and '?

423
00:37:30,527 --> 00:37:32,487
"Because I and all seek their own paradise."

424
00:37:32,607 --> 00:37:35,207
What the hell is that?

425
00:37:35,247 --> 00:37:38,927
- I have to leave the island.
- I have to pull them all here.

426
00:37:59,087 --> 00:38:01,167
Well.

427
00:38:01,247 --> 00:38:04,927
Well, radio pieces and is made
we have no boat.

428
00:38:05,007 --> 00:38:07,887
- We have boats?
- How someone stole them both?

429
00:38:07,967 --> 00:38:09,847
I do not know.
That is Smilin 'Smuggler ...

430
00:38:10,007 --> 00:38:12,167
seems to run alone.

431
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,447
- What? Her head?
- And the phone line was cut?

432
00:38:14,527 --> 00:38:16,647
I'm sure it was moth-
rats and the jungle.

433
00:38:16,687 --> 00:38:20,167
- We and the jungle rats?
- What would we call Guest notes?

434
00:38:20,287 --> 00:38:22,247
- Nothing. You saw the board.
- He's right.

435
00:38:22,287 --> 00:38:25,247
Tell them that we have a maniac on the island
and no chance of escape?

436
00:38:25,327 --> 00:38:27,887
We will have an extra hundred maniacs.

437
00:38:28,047 --> 00:38:30,887
But the sign on the Cliff?
That is clearly said, "only to staff."

438
00:38:30,927 --> 00:38:32,847
I mean we are targets and you only ourselves.

439
00:38:33,007 --> 00:38:35,367
Do not understand.

440
00:38:35,407 --> 00:38:37,767
Why after us?

441
00:38:46,767 --> 00:38:50,807
Let me finish ... you anunþaþi

442
00:38:50,927 --> 00:38:52,967
because I want to go to work.

443
00:38:53,087 --> 00:38:57,367
I thought it's time
bring it to the pros.

444
00:38:57,487 --> 00:38:59,687
- Hank?
- Yes, Hank.

445
00:38:59,727 --> 00:39:02,727
- Chief of security.
- Mean?

446
00:39:02,847 --> 00:39:05,607
He keeps tourists do not know how to steal the bus?

447
00:39:05,727 --> 00:39:08,287
It was the federal agent.

448
00:39:08,367 --> 00:39:12,447
The so is. He was chief at the F. B. I.
and s respects the serial killer.

449
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:15,647
Caught him alone on the Minneapolis Mangler.

450
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:18,927
- Who is the Minneapolis Mangler?
- Exactly.

451
00:39:19,087 --> 00:39:21,727
Pete, you realize that I gave him ...

452
00:39:21,847 --> 00:39:24,527
20 beers a day for the past 10 years, right?

453
00:39:24,607 --> 00:39:26,727
Hey, I was in Nicaragua, junior!

454
00:39:26,807 --> 00:39:29,207
When you can cram
maþele alone in their pockets ...

455
00:39:29,327 --> 00:39:31,247
and 20 km to go up
to an aid ...

456
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,047
after you beat the
knives with drug lords

457
00:39:33,127 --> 00:39:34,807
all night, then you
come to talk with me.

458
00:39:37,567 --> 00:39:40,247
Well, as we can not
get off this rock ...

459
00:39:40,367 --> 00:39:42,807
You have to catch him this guy.
- Let's get him?

460
00:39:42,927 --> 00:39:46,087
I could not catch a raccoon that I
stealing food from last month.

461
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:49,607
It asked me to catch him thi, do you?

462
00:39:50,927 --> 00:39:53,007
Here's the plan.

463
00:39:53,087 --> 00:39:56,167
I'll let this fool what he wants.

464
00:39:56,247 --> 00:39:59,847
- You sure you will do the job.
- Then tell us something.

465
00:39:59,927 --> 00:40:02,367
How to do our job if one ...

466
00:40:02,447 --> 00:40:05,407
Cut the lust to anyone on the islands?

467
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:08,207
Hold the door resin, ciumegarule.

468
00:40:08,287 --> 00:40:11,927
You read the poem on the board.

469
00:40:12,047 --> 00:40:14,487
I've seen this.

470
00:40:14,607 --> 00:40:17,887
Is this a game and you play it you will play.

471
00:40:18,007 --> 00:40:21,527
Be calm and this cat
only one will come to us.

472
00:40:21,647 --> 00:40:24,127
And when it does, I promise ...

473
00:40:24,207 --> 00:40:27,847
I'll be there.

474
00:40:36,607 --> 00:40:39,007
Come and you love it!
It strikes!

475
00:40:39,127 --> 00:40:41,167
Is not that guy.

476
00:40:41,247 --> 00:40:43,687
Maybe.
Maybe not.

477
00:40:43,767 --> 00:40:46,167
What's happening here?

478
00:40:46,287 --> 00:40:49,167
We have a serial killer and amongst us and you
give a party.

479
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:52,767
Cut the kid that was from
left to right.

480
00:40:52,887 --> 00:40:56,447
Looking for a killer and left, you idiot!

481
00:40:56,527 --> 00:40:58,287
I understand.

482
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:05,927
- Hi, Juan.
- Good.

483
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:09,007
- Good. What are you doing?
- Okay, I made a hat.

484
00:41:09,127 --> 00:41:11,527
I do not know what to say.

485
00:41:11,647 --> 00:41:14,167
Say "thank you" and put it on the head.

486
00:41:14,247 --> 00:41:17,127
Well.

487
00:41:17,247 --> 00:41:19,287
Thanks, I like it.

488
00:41:19,407 --> 00:41:21,447
Want to walk on the beach?

489
00:41:21,567 --> 00:41:24,367
Eh-

490
00:41:24,447 --> 00:41:27,287
This is like there.

491
00:41:27,367 --> 00:41:31,367
and hence the sand-water

492
00:41:36,807 --> 00:41:39,847
I heard that you were very
naughty today, Juan.

493
00:41:39,967 --> 00:41:42,087
What do you mean?

494
00:41:42,207 --> 00:41:44,727
When you need to be in the maze ...

495
00:41:44,807 --> 00:41:47,367
you actually eat watermelon.

496
00:41:47,487 --> 00:41:51,647
- How do you know?
- I see everything, Juan.

497
00:41:57,927 --> 00:42:01,287
Hey, what do you know?
What do you know?

498
00:42:01,407 --> 00:42:06,487
I think it's a good idea to go
on the beach later.

499
00:42:06,567 --> 00:42:10,687
- Both.
- Okay.

500
00:42:17,447 --> 00:42:19,327
I forgot.

501
00:42:19,407 --> 00:42:22,327
I had to go do some S'mores.

502
00:42:26,567 --> 00:42:27,807
We looked at each cottage.

503
00:42:27,847 --> 00:42:30,087
No weapons? No
clothes with blood on them?

504
00:42:30,207 --> 00:42:32,087
Only pornographic stuff
and a lot of condoms.

505
00:42:32,167 --> 00:42:34,007
Type 14 is a Bible of their wood.

506
00:42:34,087 --> 00:42:36,007
A wooden bible?
It's good.

507
00:42:36,127 --> 00:42:38,087
Good job.
Now, Jenny.

508
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:40,487
go to Yu.
He died of fear.

509
00:42:40,607 --> 00:42:42,567
You take command here.

510
00:42:42,687 --> 00:42:44,727
Okay?
At work!

511
00:42:44,807 --> 00:42:47,687
- You'll be fine?
- Yes.

512
00:42:47,807 --> 00:42:49,727
Sure.

513
00:42:53,767 --> 00:42:58,687
Shit.

514
00:42:58,767 --> 00:43:00,967
Hi, Pete.

515
00:43:02,287 --> 00:43:04,927
"Got Hope They've Hammocks
in Heaven. "

516
00:43:06,247 --> 00:43:08,447
Wonderful.

517
00:43:08,527 --> 00:43:11,447
And again, Peter.

518
00:43:11,527 --> 00:43:14,007
nebunaticule.

519
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,647
What is this?

520
00:43:26,887 --> 00:43:29,367
That's crazy!
We can not do that!

521
00:43:29,447 --> 00:43:31,487
Gura, Yu.
You'll hear guests.

522
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,007
Jenny, we can not pretend
that everything is okay, right?

523
00:43:34,087 --> 00:43:36,127
There are guests everywhere.
We must tell.

524
00:43:36,207 --> 00:43:38,847
No!
Did you see the blackboard.

525
00:43:53,447 --> 00:43:56,167
Hey, you need to return fire.
We will make an announcement.

526
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,807
Well, because I've something to tell him Roy.

527
00:43:58,887 --> 00:44:02,367
- I smoked it.
- Go!

528
00:44:02,447 --> 00:44:04,807
Idiots.

529
00:44:04,927 --> 00:44:08,327
Hey, come on the beach.

530
00:44:08,447 --> 00:44:11,167
We will make an announcement.

531
00:44:14,567 --> 00:44:16,847
Help!

532
00:44:16,967 --> 00:44:18,567
Oh, God!

533
00:44:23,207 --> 00:44:25,567
Help!

534
00:44:34,207 --> 00:44:37,327
It is always an asshole like you ...

535
00:44:37,447 --> 00:44:39,327
trying to shit in the pie.

536
00:44:41,167 --> 00:44:44,127
You can shit in one to
and she shit on you.

537
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:47,727
So why not, November 2,

538
00:44:50,367 --> 00:44:52,967
Oh, God!

539
00:46:45,127 --> 00:46:48,007
To welcome the sun!

540
00:46:54,407 --> 00:46:57,487
Hey, you dance.
It's easy when you smile.

541
00:46:57,607 --> 00:47:00,607
- I heard one of the boats last night.
- Cool!

542
00:47:00,687 --> 00:47:02,647
- I heard a little but-
- And what do we do?

543
00:47:02,767 --> 00:47:05,007
If ours, that is.
There is a good idea ...

544
00:47:05,127 --> 00:47:08,047
looking to go to, unless you
tool to Lose.

545
00:47:08,167 --> 00:47:10,207
What?

546
00:47:13,567 --> 00:47:18,007
Hey, I understand.
I know where I come from the ranks of the board.

547
00:47:18,087 --> 00:47:21,767
You know that verse, "Everybody look
own paradise?

548
00:47:21,887 --> 00:47:23,047
It's one of your cntecele.

549
00:47:23,087 --> 00:47:24,967
What the hell are you talking about?
One of my songs?

550
00:47:25,087 --> 00:47:28,687
Yes, your album
"Sea Shanties and Wet Panties. '"

551
00:47:28,807 --> 00:47:32,407
- 1978?
- Let me see your hands, folks!

552
00:47:32,487 --> 00:47:34,767
What does that song have to do with these?

553
00:47:34,887 --> 00:47:37,127
The name of the song is "Naughty Cal."

554
00:47:37,247 --> 00:47:40,167
- Naughty Cliff. Naughty Carlos.
- Naughty Horse!

555
00:47:57,887 --> 00:48:00,127
Shit.

556
00:48:00,207 --> 00:48:02,567
That was written on the board yesterday.

557
00:48:09,407 --> 00:48:11,247
I did not know where he is.

558
00:48:11,367 --> 00:48:13,847
How to know among their songs?

559
00:48:13,927 --> 00:48:17,607
Nor do I remember to be
That album did well?

560
00:48:17,727 --> 00:48:21,567
It was '78.
We were all taken to the raft.

561
00:48:21,647 --> 00:48:25,487
There were some crazy times in 1978.

562
00:48:25,607 --> 00:48:28,367
Man that I spent.

563
00:48:38,087 --> 00:48:39,927
"Up to kite?

564
00:48:40,007 --> 00:48:42,967
"He fell and broke his blade?
That's Carlos.

565
00:48:44,487 --> 00:48:47,967
Then "lost in the maze,"
just like Cliff.

566
00:48:50,567 --> 00:48:54,007
And that kills people after
some fucking lyrics?

567
00:48:54,127 --> 00:48:56,087
- This is crazy!
- Peter.

568
00:48:56,167 --> 00:49:00,967
What is the song?
Has any special significance?

569
00:49:01,087 --> 00:49:03,207
No.

570
00:49:03,327 --> 00:49:07,567
It is a fishermen's huts. Cal's Naughty
is a cowboy in the water ...

571
00:49:07,687 --> 00:49:09,567
and Bongo Tokeyand
are his friends.

572
00:49:09,647 --> 00:49:12,487
And they go on this adventure,
to find Atlantis or something.

573
00:49:12,607 --> 00:49:16,727
Listen to other lines
see what happens.

574
00:49:21,927 --> 00:49:24,127
To put it backwards.

575
00:49:28,807 --> 00:49:31,327
Listen.

576
00:49:38,087 --> 00:49:41,047
I mean what the hell?
Orca and octopus?

577
00:49:41,127 --> 00:49:43,847
That is, victims are
or crimunalii?

578
00:49:43,967 --> 00:49:47,607
Our lives depend on interpretations
the stupidest song I've heard.

579
00:49:47,687 --> 00:49:50,007
Please do not abstain.
Say what you think.

580
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:51,847
There are sensitive.

581
00:49:51,967 --> 00:49:54,527
I gained only about
Five awards in my life.

582
00:49:54,607 --> 00:49:56,847
How many have you?

583
00:49:56,967 --> 00:49:59,247
Let's see how it ends.

584
00:50:13,647 --> 00:50:16,207
Jeez.

585
00:50:16,327 --> 00:50:19,127
Pete!
Yu and Hank are dead.

586
00:50:19,207 --> 00:50:21,287
- Why? What have I done?
- No, man.

587
00:50:21,407 --> 00:50:24,007
Yu (you-you) and Hank are dead.

588
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:27,687
Are you threatening me?
Because if you do one to

589
00:50:27,807 --> 00:50:29,687
! Ay, stink!
Come and see!

590
00:50:31,967 --> 00:50:34,527
"It makes you (you) Yu. '"

591
00:50:34,607 --> 00:50:37,767
He wants to warn guests.

592
00:50:37,887 --> 00:50:39,967
Hank!

593
00:58:38,167 --> 00:58:40,087
Why do a fashion show?

594
00:58:40,207 --> 00:58:42,487
Because it's fashion week!

595
00:58:42,607 --> 00:58:46,247
Look what happened to Yu! Remember
"Do your job or die"?

596
00:58:46,327 --> 00:58:48,247
So I put a smile on their faces ...

597
00:58:48,327 --> 00:58:50,247
and go there and do our job.

598
00:58:50,327 --> 00:58:52,927
- Do you understand? Lars, you follow. Let's go.
- Roger, Pete.

599
00:58:56,967 --> 00:58:59,087
Lars Brunckhorst.

600
00:58:59,207 --> 00:59:02,407
Lars sport for Pleasure Poncho.

601
00:59:02,487 --> 00:59:06,487
At a price of anything.
Thanks, Lars.

602
00:59:06,567 --> 00:59:08,527
I mean, I do not trust the new guy.

603
00:59:08,647 --> 00:59:12,287
You're right.
It all began when he came here, right?

604
00:59:12,367 --> 00:59:14,807
- Sam is not Lars or one of us.
- Look, Jenny.

605
00:59:14,927 --> 00:59:17,927
- I know why you defend.
- Pajamas! Come on, move!

606
00:59:18,007 --> 00:59:22,247
- Putman, pillow.
- Putman Livingston, I presume.

607
00:59:22,327 --> 00:59:25,047
It even Lord
Little Lord Fauntleroy!

608
00:59:25,167 --> 00:59:26,967
Pip, pip! Tallyho!

609
00:59:27,087 --> 00:59:29,407
I understand.
In that song ...

610
00:59:29,487 --> 00:59:32,887
Naughty Knight sings about the evil octopus.

611
00:59:33,007 --> 00:59:36,327
Look at Putman!
Putman is the octopus.

612
00:59:36,407 --> 00:59:40,727
- Hello?
- Dave, go and play with the curtain.

613
00:59:40,847 --> 00:59:43,207
No. We can not ignore that song.
How about Carlos and Cliff?

614
00:59:43,287 --> 00:59:47,367
But that Hank was buried in the sand as
treasure of the song?

615
00:59:47,447 --> 00:59:49,407
Okay, maybe the octopus ...

616
00:59:49,527 --> 00:59:51,527
is the next person to die.

617
00:59:51,607 --> 00:59:54,087
How do you kill someone with an octopus?

618
00:59:54,167 --> 00:59:57,727
Octopus said backwards is "supotco."
Juan does not mean anything in Spanish?

619
00:59:57,807 --> 01:00:00,487
"Supotco? No.
The word for shoe is zapato.

620
01:00:00,567 --> 01:00:01,527
Shoe.

621
01:00:01,647 --> 01:00:05,167
Only it seems to me that
looks like an octopus?

622
01:00:05,287 --> 01:00:07,687
- Vine.
- What have I missed?

623
01:00:07,767 --> 01:00:10,727
It seems that someone will be
killed for a shoe.

624
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:14,167
What would have to turn our attention to the boats?

625
01:00:14,247 --> 01:00:18,207
- Good idea.
- Jenny, let's look together.

626
01:00:18,847 --> 01:00:20,647
Putman.

627
01:00:20,727 --> 01:00:23,167
- Why do not we go?
- Are you insane?

628
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:26,607
There I go with you in the jungle.

629
01:00:26,727 --> 01:00:29,767
If you're gonna break killer
neck like a stick.

630
01:01:12,447 --> 01:01:15,567
Well, stay on shore.
We have no reason to go into the jungle.

631
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:18,327
The boats are probably covered with sticks.

632
01:01:18,447 --> 01:01:20,407
Or branches.

633
01:01:20,527 --> 01:01:23,087
Thank you.

634
01:01:23,167 --> 01:01:25,527
Have not got any weapons?

635
01:01:25,647 --> 01:01:27,727
I do not need any weapons.

636
01:01:27,807 --> 01:01:31,207
I piss on that.
I take a machete.

637
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:33,767
Thanks for doing this, Lars.

638
01:01:33,847 --> 01:01:36,687
You're very brave.
Be careful, okay?

639
01:01:47,167 --> 01:01:50,127
Cheers, Putman.

640
01:01:52,087 --> 01:01:55,407
You are watching you, Mr. Miyagi.

641
01:02:07,567 --> 01:02:11,687
I think you are stressed
to cook for everyone ...

642
01:02:11,767 --> 01:02:14,887
but I think that you will be fine, yes.

643
01:02:14,967 --> 01:02:18,007
I bet you've seen Yu and Kelly.

644
01:02:18,127 --> 01:02:20,607
And the rest is just common sense.
Like now ...

645
01:02:20,687 --> 01:02:23,487
made famous
Coconut Pete's Paella.

646
01:02:23,607 --> 01:02:26,087
Guess someone
is the secret ingredient?

647
01:02:26,167 --> 01:02:28,927
Come on.

648
01:02:29,047 --> 01:02:31,687
Coconut Pete's Paella?

649
01:02:33,087 --> 01:02:35,367
The secret ingredient?

650
01:02:35,447 --> 01:02:38,767
Coconut ... Pete's ...

651
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:41,687
- Coconut?
- Yes, Lord, yes!

652
01:02:41,807 --> 01:02:46,567
Yes!

653
01:02:46,647 --> 01:02:51,087
Believe you that Eddie Money
had to endure this?

654
01:02:54,807 --> 01:02:57,327
Coconut Pete's Paella!

655
01:02:58,967 --> 01:03:01,847
What do you think?

656
01:03:01,967 --> 01:03:04,087
I think it has stresu-throating.

657
01:03:04,207 --> 01:03:06,167
I do not think we can be sure.

658
01:03:06,287 --> 01:03:08,407
- What are you doing?
- You know.

659
01:03:08,527 --> 01:03:11,607
We look out the window.

660
01:03:11,727 --> 01:03:14,927
Squid?

661
01:03:16,207 --> 01:03:18,287
It is an aphrodisiac, Juan.

662
01:03:20,927 --> 01:03:23,007
What is it?

663
01:03:23,127 --> 01:03:26,007
Are not you afraid of a little octopus, huh?

664
01:03:26,127 --> 01:03:28,047
Thank you.

665
01:03:29,807 --> 01:03:31,687
When you finish here ...

666
01:03:31,767 --> 01:03:33,767
I want to come and find me ...

667
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:36,927
because I'm gonna throw
tentacles around you.

668
01:03:37,007 --> 01:03:40,007
Well.

669
01:03:45,327 --> 01:03:48,687
No way.

670
01:03:52,207 --> 01:03:54,527
Think about it, the octopus.

671
01:03:54,647 --> 01:03:56,527
It is a strange chick.

672
01:03:56,607 --> 01:04:01,167
Still does not show that it is criminal.

673
01:04:01,247 --> 01:04:05,487
There is only one way to find out.

674
01:04:11,807 --> 01:04:14,367
Do not be afraid.

675
01:04:14,447 --> 01:04:19,967
I want our first time to be wonderful.

676
01:04:21,727 --> 01:04:24,567
If you are the killer ...

677
01:04:24,687 --> 01:04:26,807
I do not kill me.

678
01:04:26,927 --> 01:04:29,167
Or at least not hurt.

679
01:04:29,247 --> 01:04:31,207
With your moves are sure you can.

680
01:04:33,487 --> 01:04:36,167
We're here because we believe
that it is criminal.

681
01:04:36,767 --> 01:04:38,167
I'll bite.

682
01:04:38,287 --> 01:04:40,407
- I hope not too much.
- I like Juan.

683
01:04:40,527 --> 01:04:42,887
When we first met I was wondering,
"Who the hell is this guy?

684
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:45,047
Any local person here, "

685
01:04:47,447 --> 01:04:49,647
Mmm.

686
01:04:52,687 --> 01:04:56,687
- I was honest with you.
- That ...

687
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:59,607
not go to Oral Roberts?

688
01:05:15,167 --> 01:05:17,327
I mean ...

689
01:05:17,407 --> 01:05:21,927
I wanted to forget the past when I came here.

690
01:05:22,007 --> 01:05:25,167
What are my up a nun?

691
01:05:28,887 --> 01:05:31,367
I-

692
01:05:31,447 --> 01:05:34,287
I've never been in a place like this.

693
01:05:34,367 --> 01:05:36,247
The libertine.

694
01:05:37,807 --> 01:05:42,327
Juan, I spent all
life in the gym.

695
01:05:42,447 --> 01:05:45,287
I like to have fun like everyone else.

696
01:05:46,807 --> 01:05:49,607
My coach would kill me if they find out.

697
01:05:49,687 --> 01:05:53,807
I would like a giddy hunt.

698
01:05:53,887 --> 01:05:58,367
- It frightened
- Wait.

699
01:05:58,447 --> 01:06:02,407
- You gymnast?
- Yes.

700
01:06:03,967 --> 01:06:05,647
Thank you.

701
01:06:10,807 --> 01:06:13,327
Not ass!
No!

702
01:06:38,687 --> 01:06:41,287
Be right back.

703
01:06:43,807 --> 01:06:46,807
Well.

704
01:06:49,847 --> 01:06:52,487
Eh, still not sure.

705
01:06:52,607 --> 01:06:55,687
I need a few hours.

706
01:06:55,767 --> 01:06:57,807
Gaozarule!
Now not only do you babardesti.

707
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:00,407
How would you be if you were sitting
sex in the closet as I do?

708
01:07:00,447 --> 01:07:03,287
It would be a good idea.

709
01:07:04,207 --> 01:07:05,647
Coming!

710
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:14,727
What are you going to Jenny?

711
01:07:20,127 --> 01:07:22,167
You know, Put ...

712
01:07:22,207 --> 01:07:26,687
during the Sung dynasty, was
Po Tong Tsu a great teacher.

713
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:28,727
And he said something very smart:

714
01:07:30,367 --> 01:07:33,007
"If you love something, let him go.

715
01:07:33,127 --> 01:07:35,047
-If he turns to keep "
- Do you f. ..

716
01:07:35,127 --> 01:07:37,207
It is a postcard.

717
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:40,367
Trying to help.

718
01:07:42,047 --> 01:07:45,407
I like you, right?

719
01:07:45,567 --> 01:07:49,687
But I have my guns.

720
01:07:51,927 --> 01:07:56,247
What kind of man would be if I sit and
I look how I steal?

721
01:08:02,207 --> 01:08:04,567
Do not underestimate me, Lars.

722
01:08:08,647 --> 01:08:10,967
I know things you do not know.

723
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:43,887
Well, Lars,
see what you can.

724
01:08:54,127 --> 01:08:56,247
Look what I found.

725
01:08:56,967 --> 01:08:59,087
Yes, bright.

726
01:09:11,407 --> 01:09:13,287
Hey.

727
01:09:21,047 --> 01:09:23,007
I knew it.

728
01:09:24,647 --> 01:09:27,567
Fool.

729
01:09:38,367 --> 01:09:40,447
Lars?

730
01:09:43,647 --> 01:09:45,687
Lord!

731
01:10:10,167 --> 01:10:11,927
No!

732
01:10:13,207 --> 01:10:15,887
No!

733
01:10:30,847 --> 01:10:33,927
- You!
- Good love.

734
01:10:34,047 --> 01:10:37,727
Now get your bag that
on the head and give us a kiss.

735
01:10:39,447 --> 01:10:43,047
- What?
- Advantage, Putman.

736
01:10:46,687 --> 01:10:48,847
Putman!

737
01:10:48,927 --> 01:10:50,727
Putman!

738
01:10:50,847 --> 01:10:54,247
Putman! Wake up, Putman.
It's a dream! Just a dream, Putman.

739
01:11:03,367 --> 01:11:05,367
Goodbye.

740
01:11:13,087 --> 01:11:15,567
Look.
The ship!

741
01:11:21,807 --> 01:11:23,927
Mommy! We found the boat!

742
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:29,407
Hold your hats.

743
01:11:31,847 --> 01:11:33,887
Does not go anywhere.

744
01:11:34,007 --> 01:11:36,367
- What did you do with the propeller, man?
- I have done nothing.

745
01:11:36,487 --> 01:11:38,407
That is the one that shot him Carlos.

746
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:40,967
We can send someone on the island.

747
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:43,887
- We have plenty of strong guys.
- Not a chance.

748
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:47,207
The current trip takes you.

749
01:11:47,327 --> 01:11:50,167
You drink your own pee
in less than 20 hours.

750
01:11:51,487 --> 01:11:54,207
- Where is Putman?
- Not here?

751
01:11:54,327 --> 01:11:56,287
He left last night.
He fled into the jungle.

752
01:11:56,407 --> 01:11:59,047
It "ran" you mean "I killed him?"

753
01:11:59,167 --> 01:12:02,447
Do not we realize that the missing
Putman if you come back with a boat?

754
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:05,127
- Sam, is ridiculous.
- What is ridiculous?

755
01:12:05,247 --> 01:12:09,687
Look. Putman got a freak on
middle of the night and fled into the jungle.

756
01:12:09,767 --> 01:12:11,687
I was in your room last night, Lars.

757
01:12:11,807 --> 01:12:13,767
Mark David Chapman is a
Pete's shrine.

758
01:12:13,887 --> 01:12:16,847
- Unbelievable!
- I am a fan.

759
01:12:16,927 --> 01:12:19,167
A fan?
Dude, you loony!

760
01:12:19,287 --> 01:12:21,567
Nobody was killed last night ...

761
01:12:21,687 --> 01:12:24,767
because Lars
was in the jungle to kill Putman.

762
01:12:24,887 --> 01:12:27,247
I would not harm a person, right?

763
01:12:27,367 --> 01:12:28,887
Do not believe in violence.

764
01:12:29,567 --> 01:12:31,487
Touching other people like to feel better.

765
01:12:31,607 --> 01:12:34,087
We must-

766
01:12:34,167 --> 01:12:38,127
"You're the fun police!
- Juan!

767
01:12:38,247 --> 01:12:40,687
What the hell? Stand easy!
Do not quarrel!

768
01:12:40,767 --> 01:12:44,047
If we resist evening
ship will be here tomorrow.

769
01:12:44,127 --> 01:12:47,247
We'll be fine.
So let's drink a glass ...

770
01:12:47,327 --> 01:12:50,647
-And get drunk.
- I do not want to get drunk, Pete!

771
01:12:50,727 --> 01:12:54,007
I want to know the trick with Lars?
You come here and everyone begins to die.

772
01:12:54,087 --> 01:12:56,607
There are bound to say nothing of the pig
Fun! You want to arrest me as a joke?

773
01:12:56,727 --> 01:12:59,247
Then get a mandate joke!
Until then ...

774
01:12:59,327 --> 01:13:02,607
I do not get out the way!

775
01:13:02,687 --> 01:13:04,687
Hai!

776
01:13:08,087 --> 01:13:11,967
Jenny, you know that I am not the killer, right?

777
01:13:12,087 --> 01:13:13,967
Lars is not so bad, right?

778
01:13:14,087 --> 01:13:16,527
- I'll get some newspapers.
- Yes.

779
01:13:16,607 --> 01:13:18,727
Glass does the phrase "fixed target"?

780
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:20,847
No.

781
01:13:22,007 --> 01:13:24,487
- Boy, this is wrong.
- Listen, Jenny ...

782
01:13:24,607 --> 01:13:27,647
if he is the killer
then we have the room.

783
01:13:27,767 --> 01:13:30,327
And if not then at least he'll know.

784
01:14:18,087 --> 01:14:21,967
A putit?
Worse than hell.

785
01:14:22,047 --> 01:14:25,007
Shit!

786
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:28,447
- May stay here?
- Sure.

787
01:14:28,567 --> 01:14:31,967
I only just started.

788
01:14:37,767 --> 01:14:39,967
Free drink to that which I catch!

789
01:14:55,007 --> 01:14:56,887
Shit.

790
01:14:59,447 --> 01:15:01,767
Oh, God!

791
01:15:08,327 --> 01:15:10,927
You have answered the prayers.

792
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:13,927
- Gaozarule!
- No, I'm not.

793
01:15:14,007 --> 01:15:17,007
There are couple-only
What the hell?

794
01:15:17,087 --> 01:15:21,087
- What?
- Something I passed leg.

795
01:15:21,207 --> 01:15:23,687
I mean, there's something here.

796
01:15:23,807 --> 01:15:26,767
- What?
- No, wait!

797
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:29,407
It's just my huge tool.

798
01:15:32,007 --> 01:15:34,647
- God.
- There was something wrong?

799
01:15:34,727 --> 01:15:37,167
Dirk out of the pool!

800
01:15:37,487 --> 01:15:39,207
No kidding!

801
01:15:39,287 --> 01:15:43,727
- Faster!
- That's what I call quality service!

802
01:15:43,847 --> 01:15:46,567
Now!
Out of the pool!

803
01:15:59,447 --> 01:16:02,607
Hey, help!

804
01:16:04,087 --> 01:16:07,687
Putman!
Live!

805
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:10,047
You took me in his arms, Jenny.

806
01:16:10,167 --> 01:16:12,847
I suppose that all men
the island are dead.

807
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:15,247
You must get out of here!
Dirk is dead!

808
01:16:15,327 --> 01:16:17,647
He was electrocuted in the pool!

809
01:16:17,727 --> 01:16:21,567
Really? What was the expression on his face?
I think I screamed like hell.

810
01:16:21,687 --> 01:16:24,447
You're scaring me.

811
01:16:24,567 --> 01:16:26,887
I want to know if
smoke out his ears.

812
01:16:26,927 --> 01:16:27,967
Is there anything wrong with that?

813
01:16:29,007 --> 01:16:31,207
Putman, where were you?

814
01:16:31,327 --> 01:16:33,727
We ran in circles through this jungle.

815
01:16:33,847 --> 01:16:35,887
Well you're not dead.
You must go to Pete's cottage ...

816
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:38,007
- And to start the backup generator.
- Wait!

817
01:16:38,087 --> 01:16:42,287
If Dirk had just been killed,
Lars then can be criminal!

818
01:16:45,247 --> 01:16:47,887
Be the stage.
Can be a little nervous.

819
01:16:47,967 --> 01:16:50,447
Lars!
Lars, we are here!

820
01:16:50,567 --> 01:16:52,767
Stop stirring, Jen.

821
01:16:58,647 --> 01:17:00,647
There was no way.

822
01:17:00,727 --> 01:17:02,967
It is too big.

823
01:17:05,047 --> 01:17:07,647
You have to find Pete.

824
01:17:09,087 --> 01:17:12,247
Pete!

825
01:17:13,767 --> 01:17:15,887
Pete?

826
01:17:20,567 --> 01:17:23,167
Pete?

827
01:17:23,287 --> 01:17:25,167
You're here, Pete?

828
01:17:25,287 --> 01:17:28,487
Peter!
We need the key generator.

829
01:17:45,247 --> 01:17:49,447
- Damn!
- It takes someone at the door?

830
01:17:55,007 --> 01:17:58,767
- Who is?
- Who's there?

831
01:18:03,767 --> 01:18:06,647
Hey!

832
01:18:06,727 --> 01:18:10,327
I think it is a problem with the lights!

833
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:16,327
Maybe that
Lars came after us here.

834
01:18:16,407 --> 01:18:18,927
We are not sure that is Lars.

835
01:18:21,607 --> 01:18:25,487
What is with you and Lars?

836
01:18:25,567 --> 01:18:28,167
I mean, let's see.
You had sex with Rolo, and he is dead.

837
01:18:28,287 --> 01:18:30,287
You and Cliff, right?
It's dead.

838
01:18:30,367 --> 01:18:34,007
I did and Juan
and Pete, and they are not dead.

839
01:18:34,087 --> 01:18:36,607
Heck, Jen!
I'm the only one?

840
01:18:36,727 --> 01:18:39,007
Let's go back.
What should we do-

841
01:18:39,127 --> 01:18:41,847
Do not give so great, well, Sam?

842
01:18:41,927 --> 01:18:45,727
As soon as you finish with
"I do not have to die," Juan.

843
01:18:45,847 --> 01:18:50,607
Look for that letter
Encarnación prison?

844
01:18:50,727 --> 01:18:54,607
- What the hell?
- Why are you doing, man?

845
01:18:54,727 --> 01:18:58,167
"Juan does not show signs
bizarre behavior ...

846
01:18:58,247 --> 01:19:00,167
"Which brought him in this institution.

847
01:19:00,287 --> 01:19:03,327
"I think rehabilitated ...

848
01:19:03,447 --> 01:19:06,447
and will be part of
d.vs. staff, successful "

849
01:19:06,527 --> 01:19:09,887
- What did you do, Juan?
- Nothing, Jenny.

850
01:19:10,007 --> 01:19:12,167
What you did I?

851
01:19:12,287 --> 01:19:16,367
Costa Rica-Prison
at the bottom there you burn bad.

852
01:19:16,447 --> 01:19:20,327
- Juan, you must know.
- What did you do, Juan?

853
01:19:29,047 --> 01:19:31,407
El Chupacabra!

854
01:19:31,487 --> 01:19:33,807
- Hey!
- No!

855
01:19:35,487 --> 01:19:37,567
Oh, God!

856
01:19:42,527 --> 01:19:46,247
- How could you do that?
- Wait!

857
01:19:46,327 --> 01:19:48,847
I did not do that.
There are criminal.

858
01:19:48,927 --> 01:19:51,887
So what is this?

859
01:19:52,007 --> 01:19:54,087
Want to know what I did?

860
01:19:58,647 --> 01:20:02,247
Juan Castillo ...
was in jail ...

861
01:20:02,367 --> 01:20:05,727
having sex with a goat.

862
01:20:05,847 --> 01:20:08,687
Okay?

863
01:20:08,767 --> 01:20:10,847
What do you say?

864
01:20:10,967 --> 01:20:13,207
I lived on the farm!

865
01:20:13,287 --> 01:20:15,487
And I was alone!

866
01:20:17,087 --> 01:20:19,407
I was-

867
01:20:19,487 --> 01:20:23,087
We were two stupid kids.

868
01:20:23,167 --> 01:20:25,647
No, it was Juan.

869
01:20:25,727 --> 01:20:27,847
It was Dave ...

870
01:20:27,967 --> 01:20:29,847
huh?

871
01:20:29,927 --> 01:20:32,967
You wanted him for what he did
your parents.

872
01:20:33,087 --> 01:20:37,327
I did not know any ...

873
01:20:40,287 --> 01:20:42,247
is that David's parents ...

874
01:20:42,327 --> 01:20:47,047
were being trampled to death
a concert of Coconut Pete.

875
01:20:47,167 --> 01:20:49,607
What the hell is wrong with you, Putman?

876
01:20:49,727 --> 01:20:52,367
Everyone knows that Dave's parents
were killed at a show with Pete.

877
01:20:52,447 --> 01:20:55,167
Well you brought it up.

878
01:20:55,327 --> 01:20:59,807
What?
Believe you that I could kill him?

879
01:20:59,927 --> 01:21:02,887
Petey is my uncle.

880
01:21:03,047 --> 01:21:05,327
all you saw as a ...

881
01:21:05,407 --> 01:21:07,807
singer island's melons ...

882
01:21:07,967 --> 01:21:10,567
and a patron of the establishment, but ...

883
01:21:10,647 --> 01:21:14,207
but how many know that she was afraid of dogs ...

884
01:21:14,327 --> 01:21:16,607
and that he liked the rosemary?

885
01:21:17,567 --> 01:21:19,687
How did you know that ...

886
01:21:19,767 --> 01:21:22,967
was a Christian and that smelled like oranges?

887
01:21:23,047 --> 01:21:25,847
Yes, all good and fine, David.

888
01:21:25,967 --> 01:21:28,367
But I bet you ...

889
01:21:28,447 --> 01:21:30,687
inherited the island.

890
01:21:32,527 --> 01:21:35,487
- The island is already mine.
- What?

891
01:21:36,647 --> 01:21:38,487
Pete gave me last week.

892
01:21:38,607 --> 01:21:41,207
It came back on the road
place where he was.

893
01:21:41,247 --> 01:21:44,727
Form a supergroup-
Billy Squier and Eddie Money!

894
01:21:44,807 --> 01:21:49,407
Don Henley played drums!
It would have been cool.

895
01:21:49,447 --> 01:21:53,887
He wants to sell the island to
military bombing tests.

896
01:21:53,927 --> 01:21:56,607
But I told myself that I can do with it.

897
01:21:56,687 --> 01:21:59,927
Lars.

898
01:21:59,967 --> 01:22:02,687
No! No!

899
01:22:02,767 --> 01:22:06,127
Pete.

900
01:22:06,247 --> 01:22:09,327
Oh, God!
Pete!

901
01:22:13,087 --> 01:22:16,367
Bravo, Lars, bravo.

902
01:22:16,487 --> 01:22:19,607
Very convincing.

903
01:22:19,647 --> 01:22:24,327
- Asshole!
- Lars! No, stop!

904
01:22:28,767 --> 01:22:32,447
- To close it again.
- No!

905
01:22:32,527 --> 01:22:35,087
Stop!
Do not shut anyone!

906
01:22:35,127 --> 01:22:37,887
We will stay together in one room!

907
01:22:38,047 --> 01:22:40,047
The ship will come tomorrow.

908
01:22:40,207 --> 01:22:42,607
We go to the club, guests gather ...

909
01:22:42,767 --> 01:22:45,407
and wait until morning.

910
01:22:45,567 --> 01:22:49,047
And we survive the night, right?

911
01:23:03,447 --> 01:23:05,367
Damn, man!
Lars mreg not anywhere.

912
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:07,407
I do not go anywhere cuJuan.

913
01:23:07,887 --> 01:23:09,487
What kind of man having sex with a goat?

914
01:23:09,647 --> 01:23:11,847
We used a condom.

915
01:23:12,327 --> 01:23:14,567
You told me that they are
against your faith.

916
01:23:16,287 --> 01:23:20,447
Ehhh, you must find Peenalop.

917
01:23:20,527 --> 01:23:24,167
I'm sure you understand.

918
01:23:24,247 --> 01:23:27,287
If you get close to my cottage your head!

919
01:23:27,407 --> 01:23:31,367
Let's get outta here, Dave. Hai
Dave, get outta here, man.

920
01:23:31,487 --> 01:23:33,527
I think not.

921
01:23:37,287 --> 01:23:41,727
Jenny, you make the biggest mistake.

922
01:23:44,927 --> 01:23:46,967
I'm not sure what happened ...

923
01:23:47,047 --> 01:23:50,047
with all that dishonest business jungle.

924
01:23:50,127 --> 01:23:52,607
But I embrace your dreams.

925
01:23:54,367 --> 01:23:57,767
I think there are safer one.

926
01:23:57,887 --> 01:24:00,247
The plan has gone to hell.

927
01:24:00,367 --> 01:24:03,487
Even left us a torch.

928
01:24:03,567 --> 01:24:05,967
Jenny? Jenny?

929
01:24:54,647 --> 01:24:59,407
I think I know where the generator.

930
01:25:38,727 --> 01:25:40,767
Damn!
Perhaps I took the sword.

931
01:25:40,847 --> 01:25:44,047
I do not care if I perform a
bamboo spear, this one to assholes

932
01:25:44,167 --> 01:25:46,207
- Listen.
- Do not keep silent!

933
01:25:46,287 --> 01:25:49,127
I'm tired of fleeing-

934
01:25:49,207 --> 01:25:51,127
I thought that we have currently.

935
01:25:51,247 --> 01:25:55,167
Dave?

936
01:25:55,247 --> 01:25:58,767
Dave. Dave?

937
01:26:05,047 --> 01:26:07,327
Lord!

938
01:26:13,687 --> 01:26:17,407
I am!

939
01:26:20,527 --> 01:26:22,367
Damn!

940
01:26:29,807 --> 01:26:33,167
The lock is broken!

941
01:26:33,287 --> 01:26:35,167
It's there.

942
01:26:35,247 --> 01:26:38,367
Quick, under the bed
quickly, come!

943
01:26:38,447 --> 01:26:42,167
Not one to come.

944
01:26:49,687 --> 01:26:52,767
What are you doing?
Lars, what are you doing?

945
01:26:52,847 --> 01:26:54,767
Lars, please!

946
01:26:54,887 --> 01:26:57,167
Hai!

947
01:26:57,287 --> 01:26:59,967
Lars, go!
Coming!

948
01:27:00,047 --> 01:27:03,447
Oh, God!

949
01:27:03,527 --> 01:27:06,247
Coming!

950
01:27:08,167 --> 01:27:09,767
Damn!

951
01:27:09,847 --> 01:27:12,487
So you escaped through the window?

952
01:27:12,567 --> 01:27:14,967
Why not do that forever?

953
01:27:15,087 --> 01:27:17,767
That is a fat joke?

954
01:27:17,847 --> 01:27:19,727
What the hell?

955
01:27:21,167 --> 01:27:23,967
What the hell, Jenny?

956
01:28:07,287 --> 01:28:10,407
Putman!
You were?

957
01:28:10,487 --> 01:28:13,367
- What was I?
- Back, Putman!

958
01:28:13,487 --> 01:28:16,927
You think I am the murderer.
What fun.

959
01:28:17,007 --> 01:28:19,087
What are you doing here?

960
01:28:19,207 --> 01:28:22,007
I came to say-

961
01:28:23,007 --> 01:28:24,767
Pervert.

962
01:28:24,847 --> 01:28:28,407
Really, Jenny, there is an explanation for it.
Mean-

963
01:28:28,487 --> 01:28:31,647
It seemed such a good reminder

964
01:28:31,727 --> 01:28:35,327
I know how good you look
red, and this small-

965
01:28:35,407 --> 01:28:39,447
- No!
- God!

966
01:28:39,527 --> 01:28:41,687
- Where is key?
- Do not know.

967
01:28:41,807 --> 01:28:43,967
Lock the door!

968
01:28:44,047 --> 01:28:46,447
Lock is broken!

969
01:28:46,567 --> 01:28:48,207
Broken?

970
01:28:48,327 --> 01:28:51,887
Did you handcuffed to the bed of death,
The damn slut!

971
01:28:52,007 --> 01:28:55,727
- Sorry.
- I can not stay mad at you, Jenny.

972
01:28:55,847 --> 01:28:59,967
Hurry!
Give me the racquet and balls!

973
01:29:00,047 --> 01:29:03,327
- Quick!
- Run!

974
01:29:04,687 --> 01:29:06,407
Get out!

975
01:29:10,647 --> 01:29:13,487
Machete Phil!
I knew it!

976
01:29:24,887 --> 01:29:26,967
- Go, dear Jen ..
- No!

977
01:29:29,127 --> 01:29:31,367
Namaste.

978
01:29:31,447 --> 01:29:33,567
Go-n p.. Mine!

979
01:29:33,647 --> 01:29:36,447
Come on.

980
01:29:36,527 --> 01:29:38,887
Sorry.

981
01:29:45,607 --> 01:29:49,687
You!
I need to know that you are!

982
01:29:49,767 --> 01:29:52,687
- Do not surprise me at all.
- Hell, Putman!

983
01:29:52,807 --> 01:29:56,767
- Who is?
- You can not escape without a fight.

984
01:29:56,887 --> 01:29:59,647
But there is still wide, set-

985
01:31:05,207 --> 01:31:08,247
Soap, please.

986
01:31:20,207 --> 01:31:22,687
Hey!
Nice helmet, Lars!

987
01:31:22,807 --> 01:31:25,207
It's about time to come!

988
01:31:25,287 --> 01:31:28,287
Pour!

989
01:31:30,807 --> 01:31:33,567
Lord!
That's blood!

990
01:31:43,887 --> 01:31:47,527
- What the hell?
- God!

991
01:31:53,847 --> 01:31:57,607
You will all die!

992
01:32:07,207 --> 01:32:10,407
Help!

993
01:32:12,207 --> 01:32:15,047
Penelope!
Where is Juan?

994
01:32:15,127 --> 01:32:18,447
I have not seen all night.

995
01:32:18,567 --> 01:32:21,767
What the hell is happening?

996
01:32:21,847 --> 01:32:24,767
Juan! Juan!

997
01:32:24,847 --> 01:32:27,247
- Wait.
- What are you doing?

998
01:32:27,367 --> 01:32:31,727
- Leave me alone!
- Where the hell have you been?

999
01:32:31,847 --> 01:32:37,087
I'm looking for Peenalop.
Why look at me?

1000
01:32:37,167 --> 01:32:40,007
Because you have gone half an hour ago
and now appear bloody.

1001
01:32:40,087 --> 01:32:42,007
Because I found Putman.

1002
01:32:42,087 --> 01:32:45,087
- Is dead.
- Sam!

1003
01:32:47,847 --> 01:32:50,407
- Mud bath!
- Let's go, Peenalop.

1004
01:33:45,807 --> 01:33:49,127
- Oh, no.
- What?

1005
01:34:18,287 --> 01:34:20,887
- Get out.
- What?

1006
01:34:21,007 --> 01:34:24,487
Get out now!

1007
01:34:28,487 --> 01:34:30,767
You know that I can hold their breath ...

1008
01:34:30,887 --> 01:34:33,847
3 minutes and 33 seconds?

1009
01:34:33,967 --> 01:34:36,727
Nobody suspects the fun police.

1010
01:34:36,807 --> 01:34:39,607
- Like hell I always suspected you have.
- I did not.

1011
01:34:39,727 --> 01:34:41,607
You're shit!

1012
01:34:41,687 --> 01:34:45,807
It is the story of gagiul fire
Camp Machete Phil, free type tool.

1013
01:34:45,927 --> 01:34:48,607
No, that's just an old story of fire.

1014
01:34:48,687 --> 01:34:51,207
Why are you angry?

1015
01:34:51,287 --> 01:34:54,927
It's just a story!
I got up.

1016
01:34:55,047 --> 01:34:57,007
I am not Machete Phil.

1017
01:34:57,127 --> 01:34:59,407
Models I am Sam.

1018
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:02,487
Sam, why do that?

1019
01:35:02,567 --> 01:35:05,367
I remember like it was yesterday.

1020
01:35:05,487 --> 01:35:09,607
Rolo I asked some grass,
and I said no.

1021
01:35:09,687 --> 01:35:12,207
So I followed him into the jungle.

1022
01:35:12,327 --> 01:35:14,247
- And what do you think I saw?
- No.

1023
01:35:14,327 --> 01:35:16,807
His grass.
My Grass!

1024
01:35:16,887 --> 01:35:20,127
A bag full.

1025
01:35:20,207 --> 01:35:23,607
And those two sluts smoking the ...

1026
01:35:23,727 --> 01:35:26,727
although he said he does not.

1027
01:35:28,247 --> 01:35:32,527
So-
No, wait, is not it.

1028
01:35:32,647 --> 01:35:35,007
I learned that Pete gave Dave island.

1029
01:35:35,087 --> 01:35:37,927
Yes. That's it.
There was no grass.

1030
01:35:38,007 --> 01:35:41,647
However it was not nice.

1031
01:35:41,767 --> 01:35:44,727
It was the island that gave
lu this ox-head!

1032
01:35:44,847 --> 01:35:48,407
All night in delirium
pig dog!

1033
01:35:48,487 --> 01:35:51,967
But I?
I deserve it!

1034
01:35:52,087 --> 01:35:54,807
The best employee of this place!

1035
01:35:54,927 --> 01:35:56,887
Dave is destroyed.

1036
01:35:57,007 --> 01:36:00,447
This is my home.

1037
01:36:00,527 --> 01:36:04,127
Pete believed that there are only a clown.

1038
01:36:04,207 --> 01:36:06,847
I have made you do the job, right?

1039
01:36:06,927 --> 01:36:09,047
I have pretty good skills, do not you?

1040
01:36:09,167 --> 01:36:13,127
We have made an idiot to figure out that song.

1041
01:36:15,567 --> 01:36:17,687
Who is the orca?
Who is the octopus?

1042
01:36:17,767 --> 01:36:22,447
I am the walrus!

1043
01:36:24,807 --> 01:36:27,407
Get out of here! Now!
I can not take much.

1044
01:36:27,527 --> 01:36:30,287
Trying to sleep!
Try Panda snoring!

1045
01:36:30,407 --> 01:36:33,127
I can not reach.
I can handle.

1046
01:36:33,207 --> 01:36:35,407
We have an orgasm a few minutes.
Valley!

1047
01:36:35,527 --> 01:36:37,847
- Do not leave!
- I'll be fine.

1048
01:36:37,967 --> 01:36:39,967
Go away, we will have trouble.

1049
01:36:40,687 --> 01:36:43,007
Come on.

1050
01:36:49,527 --> 01:36:51,927
- Back to the club!
- Are you crazy?

1051
01:36:52,047 --> 01:36:56,087
It is the safest building on the island.
There we drink!

1052
01:37:02,767 --> 01:37:04,647
Baba-Boobie!

1053
01:37:04,727 --> 01:37:07,487
- Peenalop!
- Juan!

1054
01:37:07,567 --> 01:37:10,127
Oh, God!

1055
01:37:10,247 --> 01:37:13,607
Watching us.
It is safer with him. Let's go!

1056
01:37:14,927 --> 01:37:16,887
Let's go!

1057
01:37:16,967 --> 01:37:18,887
Hold the gate!

1058
01:37:31,567 --> 01:37:33,527
Oh, God!

1059
01:38:17,767 --> 01:38:19,927
Stop!

1060
01:38:20,007 --> 01:38:23,927
Stop!
What are you doing?

1061
01:38:24,007 --> 01:38:26,767
- You will not succeed!
- Sam! Please!

1062
01:38:26,847 --> 01:38:31,727
Watch out!

1063
01:38:31,807 --> 01:38:35,047
Louder!

1064
01:38:35,167 --> 01:38:38,927
Can not breathe!

1065
01:38:43,127 --> 01:38:45,127
Penelope!
Get up.

1066
01:38:50,327 --> 01:38:53,727
Juan! Juan! Juan, get up!

1067
01:38:53,847 --> 01:38:55,847
Juan above.

1068
01:38:55,967 --> 01:38:59,887
Hurry!

1069
01:39:05,087 --> 01:39:08,847
It is not a party to
not break someone jacuzzi.

1070
01:39:23,447 --> 01:39:26,327
- Lars!
Fun ...

1071
01:39:26,407 --> 01:39:28,527
s over.

1072
01:39:31,487 --> 01:39:33,967
What happened to fall?

1073
01:39:53,127 --> 01:39:55,007
So!

1074
01:39:58,487 --> 01:40:02,407
- No!
- It's impossible!

1075
01:40:02,487 --> 01:40:04,607
- What do we do?
- Can we lost in the jungle.

1076
01:40:04,727 --> 01:40:07,007
- In the jungle?
- Can I go through it!

1077
01:40:11,327 --> 01:40:13,647
Hai!

1078
01:40:13,727 --> 01:40:15,967
- Faster!
- Go!

1079
01:40:16,127 --> 01:40:19,927
I know where that leads!
Let's go!

1080
01:40:25,247 --> 01:40:28,367
Lord!
That was your big plan?

1081
01:40:28,447 --> 01:40:31,567
We can be successful, flow.
Okay, now listen.

1082
01:40:31,647 --> 01:40:34,407
I know this sounds disgusting, but ...

1083
01:40:34,487 --> 01:40:38,447
you keep your feet jump
close and glued pieces.

1084
01:40:38,527 --> 01:40:42,207
Otherwise water will enter through the ass hole
and will make meteor sling.

1085
01:40:42,247 --> 01:40:44,087
Yucky!

1086
01:40:44,207 --> 01:40:45,847
Where are you?

1087
01:40:45,967 --> 01:40:50,207
- Walk your hands, Juan.
- Coming!

1088
01:40:57,087 --> 01:41:00,007
Jesus!
Who is this girl?

1089
01:41:00,127 --> 01:41:02,047
It is ...

1090
01:41:02,087 --> 01:41:04,247
My girlfriend.

1091
01:41:26,207 --> 01:41:27,967
- You see?
- I saw it.

1092
01:41:28,087 --> 01:41:29,127
Oh, my asshole!

1093
01:41:29,247 --> 01:41:31,727
- What did you see?
- Randy Rumrunner.

1094
01:41:31,807 --> 01:41:34,327
Failed.
Went to the bottom.

1095
01:41:34,407 --> 01:41:37,087
Juan, you can go to the bottom to take the propeller?

1096
01:41:37,167 --> 01:41:39,647
We can make Smilin'Smuggler.

1097
01:41:39,727 --> 01:41:43,367
- It's done, my friend.
- Come on, come on.

1098
01:42:04,047 --> 01:42:06,007
Hai!

1099
01:42:08,007 --> 01:42:11,327
Juan!

1100
01:42:12,927 --> 01:42:16,447
- Hai.
- In the boat.

1101
01:42:19,167 --> 01:42:22,967
Lord!
Where the hell is Juan?

1102
01:42:23,047 --> 01:42:26,647
- Juan? Juan?
- Juan, where are you?

1103
01:42:31,007 --> 01:42:33,167
- Jesus, bleeding.
- I have no shit.

1104
01:42:33,287 --> 01:42:35,967
- Let it be seen on the other.
- O to mount.

1105
01:42:38,887 --> 01:42:41,407
Come on.

1106
01:42:44,807 --> 01:42:46,807
Juan!

1107
01:42:48,767 --> 01:42:52,247
I'm fine.

1108
01:42:52,327 --> 01:42:55,407
I can not imagine a better way to die.

1109
01:42:55,527 --> 01:42:59,407
Just remember, Peenalop.

1110
01:42:59,527 --> 01:43:02,287
I love you.
! By Carajo mierda!

1111
01:43:02,367 --> 01:43:04,687
I love you!

1112
01:43:04,767 --> 01:43:07,287
Maybe ...

1113
01:43:07,367 --> 01:43:09,367
before I go ...

1114
01:43:09,487 --> 01:43:11,367
a kiss.

1115
01:43:13,607 --> 01:43:15,927
No.

1116
01:43:16,007 --> 01:43:19,167
I mean if you and Jenny to be able ...

1117
01:43:19,247 --> 01:43:21,687
kiss you.

1118
01:43:21,767 --> 01:43:23,967
Always ...

1119
01:43:24,047 --> 01:43:26,207
I wanted ...

1120
01:43:26,287 --> 01:43:29,807
to see that.

1121
01:43:29,927 --> 01:43:33,207
- God!
- Juan!

1122
01:43:33,287 --> 01:43:35,687
Juan!

1123
01:44:00,327 --> 01:44:01,647
Hai!

1124
01:44:01,767 --> 01:44:06,167
Pig dog!

1125
01:44:14,567 --> 01:44:16,927
Hai!

1126
01:44:26,407 --> 01:44:28,447
Shit!
Turn!

1127
01:44:28,527 --> 01:44:31,007
- Lars, what are you doing?
- Trust me.

1128
01:44:33,127 --> 01:44:35,007
- Lars, stop!
- Go!

1129
01:44:36,527 --> 01:44:39,047
Yes!

1130
01:44:40,967 --> 01:44:43,287
- We approach the dock!
- I know.

1131
01:45:05,887 --> 01:45:08,127
Yes!

1132
01:45:11,247 --> 01:45:13,527
- Easy.
- Okay.

1133
01:45:15,807 --> 01:45:18,607
You must cut the rope that.

1134
01:45:22,047 --> 01:45:25,687
Go, Jenny!
Hai!

1135
01:45:33,047 --> 01:45:34,007
Yes!

1136
01:45:55,727 --> 01:45:58,327
Let's get the hell out of here.

1137
01:46:07,367 --> 01:46:10,327
- Go!
- Go!

1138
01:46:15,207 --> 01:46:18,367
Die!

1139
01:46:18,447 --> 01:46:20,287
Pig dog!

1140
01:46:29,287 --> 01:46:31,687
I'll probably give out of
pacifists club now.

1141
01:46:31,807 --> 01:46:34,047
Or at least you will ask nicely to leave.

1142
01:46:38,567 --> 01:46:40,567
Tian, you ...

1143
01:46:40,687 --> 01:46:43,247
Paradise Point.

1144
01:46:58,207 --> 01:47:00,927
Let's go, Peenalop.
