1
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:43,418
{y:bi}# You walk in a room

2
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,963
{y:bi}# A woman can feel the heat

3
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,550
{y:bi}# One look is a guarantee

4
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:55,263
{y:bi}# Nights could be long and sweet

5
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:58,350
{y:bi}# The message is clear

6
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,978
{y:bi}# Like nothing I've ever known

7
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:05,774
{y:bi}# But from all that I hear

8
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:09,402
{y:bi}# Forget about long-range plans

9
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:13,573
{y:bi}# Cos this man's got his own

10
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:21,331
{y:bi}# To get mixed up with
{y:bi}a man who says never

11
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:29,297
{y:bi}# May be big trouble, but then

12
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:36,471
{y:bi}# I just could be the woman to take you

13
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:42,560
{y:bi}# And make you never say never again

14
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,897
{y:bi}# Never, never say never again

15
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:49,651
{y:bi}# Never, never say never again

16
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,363
{y:bi}# Never, never say never again

17
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:57,325
{y:bi}# Never, never say never again

18
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,453
{y:bi}# You've got all the moves

19
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:04,040
{y:bi}# Ah, but baby I got 'em too

20
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:09,546
{y:bi}# No matter your attitude or your mood

21
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,465
{y:bi}# I'll come through

22
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:16,136
{y:bi}# The touch of your voice

23
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:19,222
{y:bi}# The feel of your eyes on me

24
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,934
{y:bi}# You leave me no choice

25
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,479
{y:bi}# Though I know there's danger there

26
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:30,775
{y:bi}# I don't care, let it be

27
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:38,700
{y:bi}# To get in bed with
{y:bi}a man who says never

28
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:46,416
{y:bi}# May have no future, but then

29
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:53,548
{y:bi}# I just could be the woman to reach you

30
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:59,387
{y:bi}# And teach you to never say never again

31
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:04,642
{y:bi}# I'll bet you, I'll get you

32
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:08,396
{y:bi}# I'll reach you, I'll teach you

33
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,819
{y:bi}# I'll take you, I'll make you

34
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,776
One minute, 47 seconds, sir.

35
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:40,989
- Not too shabby, sir.
- But dead, 007. Dead!

36
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,660
You should have studied
the plot more carefully.

37
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:49,789
Fanatical revolutionaries
kidnap a millionaire's daughter.

38
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:53,710
Of course she could have been
brainwashed. Could have turned.

39
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,921
- Evidently she did.
- With due respect, sir,

40
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,966
I played for two weeks
and I only got killed once.

41
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,802
Twice. The land mine
on the Black Sea beach.

42
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,638
Correction, sir:
I lost both legs. I did not die.

43
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,183
You were immobilised.

44
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,562
It can never be the same
playing with blanks.

45
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,023
It is somewhat different in the field.

46
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:19,569
With your life on the line, you...
Well, your adrenaline gives you an edge.

47
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:24,074
Is your edge sharp? That's the difference
between a double-0 and a corpse.

48
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:28,536
Since you took over, sir,
you've had little use for the double-0s.

49
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,539
I've spent most of my time teaching,

50
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,917
- not doing.
- Oh, I'll make you no secret.

51
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:38,755
I hold your methods in much less regard
than my illustrious predecessor did.

52
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,174
But my duty is to keep you up to par.

53
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,930
Too many free radicals,
that's your problem.

54
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:51,643
- Free radicals, sir?
- Toxins that destroy the body and brain.

55
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:56,981
Caused by eating too much red meat and
white bread, and too many dry martinis.

56
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:01,361
- Then I shall cut out the white bread, sir.
- You'll do more than that, 007.

57
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:05,782
From now on, you will be suffering
a strict regimen of diet and exercise.

58
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,536
We shall purge those toxins from you.

59
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,913
- Shrublands?
- You've got it.

60
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:20,171
- Have you got an assignment, James?
- Yes. Yes, Moneypenny.

61
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,759
I'm to eliminate all free radicals.

62
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,597
Do be careful.

63
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,239
- Welcome to Shrublands, sir.
- Thank you.

64
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:50,243
My word. They don't make them
like this any more.

65
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:54,122
- It's still in pretty good shape.
- This way, sir.

66
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,500
Your body's got enough
scar tissue for an entire regiment.

67
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:02,714
- Right... But it's still in pretty good shape.
- We'll be the judge of that, Mr Bond.

68
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:06,468
Our job is not just to rehabilitate you.
It's to re-educate you.

69
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:11,806
I want to open your mind to the virtues
of nutrition, proper exercise, meditation

70
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,351
and, hopefully, spiritual enlightenment.

71
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:18,605
I'd like you to see the iridologist at four,
have a colonic at five

72
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:23,902
and then you can cut along to the
light-dining room for a cup of parsley tea.

73
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:30,033
Mr Bond, I need a urine sample.
If you could fill this beaker for me...

74
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,826
From here?

75
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,208
{y:bi}Bonjour.

76
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:42,295
- Box 274 and quickly, please.
{y:bi}- Ah, oui. Suivez-moi.

77
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:42,897
We have invested extensively in
the Middle East and Central America

78
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,692
to promote insurgency and revolution.

79
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:50,989
Fortunately our capital outlay
has been handsomely offset

80
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:56,369
by the resultant sales
of armaments and missiles.

81
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:02,667
You will note that we have supplied
both rebels and government forces

82
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,753
on an equal basis.

83
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:10,091
In matters of death,
SPECTRE is strictly impartial.

84
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:17,432
Now for the future. SPECTRE's
most audacious enterprise of any,

85
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:21,853
next to which our previous
ventures are inconsequential.

86
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:26,900
Our esteemed Number One is in
complete charge of the entire operation,

87
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:31,321
which will henceforth
be called "The Tears of Allah".

88
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,574
He will now join us.

89
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:41,289
According to plans,
an American air-force officer

90
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:46,086
has been introduced
to a cruel mistress: heroin.

91
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:50,590
I understand he is now
our willing and obedient servant.

92
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:53,593
{y:bi}A surgical operation
{y:bi}has been performed on him.

93
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,054
{y:bi}As a result of a corneal implant,

94
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:01,142
{y:bi}his right-eye print is an exact replica of
{y:bi}that of the president of the United States.

95
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:06,523
{y:bi}He will soon be moved to
{y:bi}a convalescent clinic near London.

96
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,776
{y:bi}I have chosen Number 12
{y:bi}to have the responsibility

97
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:13,279
{y:bi}of taking the most tenderloving care

98
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,241
{y:bi}of Captain Jack Petachi.

99
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,045
I beg your pardon.
Is there no speed limit here?

100
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:33,717
She's not staff. She must be
one of those private nurses.

101
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,176
My name is Bond.

102
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,763
Oh, you're Mr Bond!
I believe I'm having you in half an hour.

103
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,058
- Oh, splendid! Your room or mine?
- Mine.

104
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:53,278
That's it. OK, now just move back
on the couch for me, please. That's it.

105
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:57,699
Let's have this arm on the shoulder.
This one... no, underneath there. Good.

106
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,868
OK, now just relax.

107
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:12,005
Yes, there are slight lesions
of the thoracic vertebrae.

108
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,591
Now, if you just hold still...

109
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:20,055
Yes. Some sacroiliac strain
at the base of the spine.

110
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:23,725
There is a more beneficial
therapy for a man's lower back.

111
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,935
- Oh, really?
- Mm.

112
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,104
And what might that be?

113
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,814
I thought I'd... surprise you, James.

114
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,775
Well, you have. Come in.

115
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:18,488
No, no. I can't come in. You know if they
found me here they'd fire me on the spot.

116
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:23,535
I won't let anyone find you. Don't worry.
I have my reputation to think of.

117
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:28,873
I don't think you got your reputation
by living on a diet of wild rice. So...

118
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:32,127
Lentil delight. Dandelion salad.

119
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,046
Goat's cheese.

120
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,593
Beluga caviar. Quail's eggs. Vodka.

121
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:44,431
Foie gras.

122
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,227
Strasbourg.

123
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,983
{y:bi}In question time
{y:bi}at the House of Commons,

124
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:59,237
{y:bi}the minister said that local authorities
{y:bi}should be given far wider...

125
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,425
Jack's been smoking again!

126
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,681
Jack was ordered not to smoke.

127
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,480
Smoking is dirty.

128
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,441
It gets into Jack's eye.

129
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:45,075
Jack must do as he's told if he wants
his fast cars and his pretty clothes.

130
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,163
- And if he wants to keep his sister alive...
- You leave Domino out of this!

131
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,632
Mmm. James?

132
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,482
Get up!

133
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:30,662
Now let's just take a look, shall we?

134
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,041
Ah! Very good.

135
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:41,089
With a contact lens
both eyes will look exactly the same.

136
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:47,679
Now, darling must do
his little trickie in eight seconds.

137
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:52,392
Then nursie will give baby his candy.

138
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:55,061
Mm?

139
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:20,670
P... three... four... one...

140
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,635
Come on, Jack!

141
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,598
- Oh, damn!
- Try it again, darling!

142
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,314
- Who's that?
- A man!

143
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,900
- At the window!
- Don't move.

144
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:49,074
- Did he see you?
- I don't know.

145
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:52,327
I guess he could have.

146
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:02,128
- Do you know him?
- Oh, yes!

147
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,798
007.

148
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:16,851
Good morning, Mr Bond. Miss Fearing
tells me you're making fine progress.

149
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,770
Oh, yes.

150
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:22,440
But I must say, you're looking
a bit peaked this morning.

151
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:25,276
- I was up all night.
- Don't overdo it.

152
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,821
A herbal enema should fix you up.

153
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:32,158
Thank you... Sounds terrific!

154
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:02,832
I'll be done in a minute.

155
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,606
Heavy, Mr Bond?

156
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,530
Let's try again.

157
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:56,988
{y:bi}Through the defensive walls...

158
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,574
{y:bi}He shoots... It's there!

159
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,132
You lunatics!

160
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:33,061
I send you to a health farm to get yourself
in shape. Instead you demolish it!

161
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:38,608
I've had to notify the local police, pull out
the special branch, muzzle the press

162
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:43,738
and allocate a large chunk of my meagre
budget to renovating the establishment!

163
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:48,660
- A man did try to kill me, sir.
- Caught you seducing his wife, did he?

164
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:54,165
No, sir, not at all. But I lost four pounds
and God knows how many free radicals.

165
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:59,129
That is the kind of attitude
that tempts me to suspend you, 007!

166
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,431
This test assesses distance and accuracy

167
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:12,726
of cruise-missile release
from the support country.

168
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:15,311
These ALCMs, with dummy warheads,

169
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:21,484
will go from terrain following to inertial
guidance, over water, toward the target.

170
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:24,404
- We hope!
{y:bi}- Stand by.

171
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:27,991
{y:bi}Countdown is go for dummy-warhead
{y:bi}loading and B-1 flight.

172
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:30,452
{y:bi}Let's hope we never
{y:bi}have to use the real thing.

173
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:34,080
All right, men, this is it.
Let's make it a good one.

174
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:00,458
{y:bi}Mr President, please stand by

175
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:04,963
{y:bi}while authority for this procedure
{y:bi}is confirmed by eye-print check.

176
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:11,094
{y:bi}If confirmation is not authenticated within
{y:bi}eight seconds, the base will be sealed.

177
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:14,848
{y:bi}Eight... seven...

178
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:16,891
{y:bi}- six... five...
- Come on!

179
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:20,103
{y:bi}- four... three... two...
- Come on!

180
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:22,605
{y:bi}one. Thank you.

181
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:26,860
{y:bi}Presidential authority is confirmed
{y:bi}for change of test procedure.

182
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:32,323
{y:bi}Dummy warheads will be replaced
{y:bi}by W-80 thermonuclear device.

183
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:34,451
{y:bi}Have a nice day.

184
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:10,588
Jack!

185
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,718
Bravo!

186
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:29,482
No! No!

187
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:04,434
Ooh, my poor angel!

188
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:06,811
My sweet baby!

189
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:11,001
Mr Kovacs, how much longer?

190
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:14,170
They're coming. They're almost in range.

191
00:29:40,363 --> 00:29:45,869
{y:bi}Safety officer to base. Radar confirms
{y:bi}both missiles on descent trajectory.

192
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:49,789
What the hell's going on here?
They've got maximum thrust.

193
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:52,083
{y:bi}About to cross minimum cruise height.

194
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:55,712
{y:bi}- Descending below minimum height...
- Damn! We've lost 'em!

195
00:31:01,695 --> 00:31:03,738
We've got them!

196
00:31:09,828 --> 00:31:12,997
{y:bi}- Well, Kovacs?
- The fish are netted.

197
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:16,418
Put them on ice.

198
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:22,173
I am supreme commander of SPECTRE,

199
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:26,553
the Special Executive
for Counterintelligence,

200
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:29,681
Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion.

201
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:33,059
{y:bi}Yesterday morning the American air force

202
00:31:33,143 --> 00:31:38,356
{y:bi}launched two cruise missiles
{y:bi}from Swadley airbase in Great Britain.

203
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,694
{y:bi}Through the ingenuity of SPECTRE,
{y:bi}the dummy warheads they carried

204
00:31:42,777 --> 00:31:46,114
{y:bi}were replaced with
{y:bi}live nuclear warheads.

205
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:51,494
{y:bi}Your weapons of destruction
{y:bi}are now safely in our possession

206
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:54,873
{y:bi}and will be moved to two secret targets.

207
00:31:55,749 --> 00:32:01,171
{y:bi}Please note the serial numbers of
{y:bi}the missiles. They will confirm the truth.

208
00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:06,551
{y:bi}Your weapons of deterrence
{y:bi}did not deter us from our objective.

209
00:32:07,552 --> 00:32:10,638
{y:bi}A terrible catastrophe now confronts you.

210
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:17,771
{y:bi}However, it can be avoided by
{y:bi}paying a tribute to our organisation,

211
00:32:17,896 --> 00:32:24,152
{y:bi}amounting to 25% of your respective
{y:bi}countries' annual oil purchases.

212
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:30,075
{y:bi}We have accomplished two of the
{y:bi}functions the name SPECTRE embodies:

213
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:32,786
{y:bi}terror and extortion.

214
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:40,085
{y:bi}If our demands are not met within seven
{y:bi}days, we shall ruthlessly deploy the third:

215
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:42,337
{y:bi}revenge.

216
00:32:54,391 --> 00:32:57,477
That would be $25 billion a year!

217
00:33:01,523 --> 00:33:03,483
Order!

218
00:33:03,608 --> 00:33:06,236
This would destabilise
the monetary system!

219
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:09,030
I call this meeting to order!

220
00:33:09,114 --> 00:33:13,743
The foreign secretary wishes
to address you! Lord Ambrose.

221
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:19,749
Gentlemen, we are faced
with the ultimate nightmare:

222
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:22,377
the abduction of nuclear warheads.

223
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:25,547
But how is this possible?

224
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:29,134
Up to now, our procedures
relating to nuclear hardware

225
00:33:29,217 --> 00:33:31,761
have been absolutely foolproof.

226
00:33:34,472 --> 00:33:39,102
I hope the American government realises
its awesome responsibility in this matter!

227
00:33:39,227 --> 00:33:42,981
NATO has a joint responsibility
to solve this problem.

228
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:47,277
But if this gets out,
it will cause worldwide panic!

229
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,113
How well has this information
been contained?

230
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:52,574
Apart from those present in this room,

231
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:56,369
the information resides only with
the CIA and British lntelligence.

232
00:33:56,453 --> 00:34:00,623
Wonderful! That means
by now it's all over the Kremlin!

233
00:34:03,793 --> 00:34:07,881
I know your feelings, M,
but I insist you reactivate the double-0s.

234
00:34:07,964 --> 00:34:10,008
As you wish, sir.

235
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:24,314
{y:bi}Maximillian Largo, born Bucharest, 1945.

236
00:34:24,397 --> 00:34:26,775
{y:bi}Industrialist and philanthropist.

237
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:31,029
{y:bi}Resident Nassau, Bahamas.
{y:bi}No known criminal associations.

238
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:34,366
You still here, Moneypenny?
You should be in bed.

239
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:39,204
James, we both should be.
Instead I'm looking everywhere for you.

240
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:44,668
Forget that. M wants to see you right now.
It's panic stations upstairs.

241
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:49,464
He's been with the prime minister all day.
I think you're back in business, James.

242
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:37,470
- Morning, gentlemen.
- Morning!

243
00:35:38,346 --> 00:35:41,933
- The latest reports? Everything OK?
- Yes, sir.

244
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,521
- Morning.
- Morning, Charles.

245
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:56,406
In secret, the Americans are
trying to trace the missile

246
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:58,366
on their eastern seaboard.

247
00:35:58,491 --> 00:36:02,412
The other allegedly threatens
the oilfields of the Middle East.

248
00:36:02,537 --> 00:36:05,206
How well protected are they from the air?

249
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:09,336
Everyone's collaborating.
The Americans, NATO, the Japanese...

250
00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:12,756
They're putting up an air screen
a mosquito couldn't get through.

251
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:16,926
Our concern is that the warhead
may already be in position.

252
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:21,639
The worst devastation would result
from a subterranean explosion.

253
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:24,684
You see, the oil-bearing strata
in the area...

254
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:27,937
Interconnected by
a surprisingly delicate structure.

255
00:36:28,063 --> 00:36:30,523
It would be a sort of ripple effect.

256
00:36:31,316 --> 00:36:34,652
What's the Americans' story
on how the damn things were stolen?

257
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:37,947
The release of ALCMs
has to come from the president.

258
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:43,703
Even that has safeguards. It can only be
authorised after a scan of his right eye.

259
00:36:43,787 --> 00:36:47,040
The only irregularity is that
a communications officer

260
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:52,962
unofficially left the base at the time
of launch. A certain Captain Jack Petachi.

261
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:55,507
If this Petachi was involved,

262
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:59,886
is it conceivable that
he could have used a false eye?

263
00:36:59,969 --> 00:37:02,430
Oh, do come along, Bond!

264
00:37:02,555 --> 00:37:05,642
Let's think of a more
logical explanation, shall we?

265
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,700
{y:bi}OK, let's run through
{y:bi}that routine from yesterday.

266
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,714
- Let's go again.
- OK.

267
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,300
Four, five, six, seven, down.

268
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:40,153
Max!

269
00:38:44,991 --> 00:38:48,578
As usual, I have left you
alone too long, I know.

270
00:38:49,746 --> 00:38:52,582
But I brought you a gift.

271
00:38:52,665 --> 00:38:55,210
I don't want any more gifts.

272
00:38:55,335 --> 00:38:58,088
I just want you. That's all I want.

273
00:38:58,171 --> 00:39:01,341
I know, but this is different.

274
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:03,760
- Look. Look.
- Oh, Max!

275
00:39:07,013 --> 00:39:10,100
- What is it?
- It's very old.

276
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:15,438
Oh!

277
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:20,235
- What's the inscription?
- Arabic. "The Tears of Allah."

278
00:39:20,652 --> 00:39:24,781
The story is that the prophet wept
for the barrenness of the desert

279
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:27,242
- and his tears made a well.
- Mmm.

280
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:31,913
It's a legend, of course,
but like all great legends,

281
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:34,499
it is also the truth.

282
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:44,175
It is the most valuable thing...

283
00:39:45,593 --> 00:39:47,887
I have ever possessed.

284
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:50,056
Except you.

285
00:39:50,181 --> 00:39:52,225
Hmmm.

286
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:59,482
- And you trust me to wear it?
- A safer place I couldn't imagine.

287
00:40:02,485 --> 00:40:05,572
And what if I ever leave you?

288
00:40:13,496 --> 00:40:15,623
No, really!

289
00:40:15,707 --> 00:40:18,168
Then I cut your throat.

290
00:41:00,001 --> 00:41:04,964
Nice to know even old Q can surprise
one of you double-0s occasionally.

291
00:41:05,882 --> 00:41:07,926
Algernon!

292
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:11,930
Not quite perfected yet.

293
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:16,601
You could write a very
binding contract with this.

294
00:41:16,726 --> 00:41:20,647
Yeah, I wish I had a new contract.
They've slashed my budget.

295
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:26,236
You can't get the spare parts. And when
you can, some strike stops delivery.

296
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:30,156
And look at this place!
They keep it bloody freezing down here!

297
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,283
Plays havoc with my sinuses.

298
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:34,786
We're both humble servants of the Crown.

299
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:37,872
If the CIA made me an offer,
I'd be off like a shot.

300
00:41:37,997 --> 00:41:41,251
Unlimited resources, air conditioning,

301
00:41:41,334 --> 00:41:44,838
28 flavours of ice cream in the restaurant.

302
00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:50,301
It's a motorbike toy. If I can get the thing
to work properly, I'll ship it out to you.

303
00:41:50,385 --> 00:41:54,389
Wait a minute! I've got something
in here that could be useful.

304
00:41:54,472 --> 00:42:00,395
The prototype came from a KGB defector.
Bit of a whiz kid in their technical section.

305
00:42:00,478 --> 00:42:05,025
Not a bad chap, though like
all defectors, prone to melancholy.

306
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:08,653
I suppose it's all that vodka
and English weather.

307
00:42:08,778 --> 00:42:10,822
Ah.

308
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:15,994
Rather tasty, this is.
It looks like a watch, but it's really a laser.

309
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:18,955
- Keeps perfect time.
- But for how long?

310
00:42:20,373 --> 00:42:22,667
At least your lifetime.

311
00:42:24,586 --> 00:42:29,049
Good to see you, Mr Bond.
Things have been awfully dull round here.

312
00:42:29,132 --> 00:42:32,135
Bureaucrats running the place,
things done by the book.

313
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:35,680
Can't make a decision unless
the computer gives you the go-ahead.

314
00:42:35,805 --> 00:42:40,101
Now you're on this, I hope we're going to
have some gratuitous sex and violence.

315
00:42:40,226 --> 00:42:43,980
I certainly hope so too. What is this for?

316
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:48,443
I'll show you. You unscrew it,

317
00:42:49,277 --> 00:42:51,905
then stick it up your nose.

318
00:42:52,572 --> 00:42:56,576
- It's for my sinus.
- Well, I won't need one where I'm going.

319
00:42:56,659 --> 00:43:00,080
Where's that,
or are you not allowed to say?

320
00:43:00,163 --> 00:43:03,833
- The Bahamas.
- Lucky bloody you!

321
00:43:31,569 --> 00:43:34,656
- Oh, sorry!
- That's perfectly all right.

322
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:43,832
- What are you hoping to catch?
- Something about 6'2", 190lb,

323
00:43:43,915 --> 00:43:47,669
- with brown eyes.
- Well, why bother going to sea?

324
00:43:50,714 --> 00:43:53,633
- Let me help you.
- Mr Bond!

325
00:43:55,969 --> 00:43:59,139
- I say, Mr Bond!
- Catch you later, perhaps.

326
00:43:59,222 --> 00:44:00,390
Right.

327
00:44:04,686 --> 00:44:09,149
Nigel Small-Fawcett,
British Embassy, Nassau.

328
00:44:09,232 --> 00:44:12,152
- How do you do, Nigel?
- Sorry I'm late.

329
00:44:12,235 --> 00:44:16,614
As you're an undercover johnny, I took
the precaution of not being followed.

330
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:19,576
That's why you shouted
my name across the harbour?

331
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:22,662
Oh, God, did l? Oh, I'm sorry.

332
00:44:22,787 --> 00:44:25,707
Damn! Damn!

333
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:28,335
Sorry. I'm rather new to all this.

334
00:44:30,045 --> 00:44:33,381
- What's the score with Largo?
- He's highly visible here.

335
00:44:33,465 --> 00:44:37,218
Enormously wealthy.
Owns the biggest boat in the Caribbean.

336
00:44:37,302 --> 00:44:40,305
Spends a lot of his time
at a place called Bluebeard Reef.

337
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:42,390
Marine archaeology, I gather.

338
00:44:42,515 --> 00:44:44,976
- You've met him?
- Oh, yes. He's charming.

339
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:49,522
I mean... foreign,
but charming nonetheless.

340
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:53,651
He donates a lot of money to worthy
causes. He built a maritime museum

341
00:44:53,735 --> 00:44:58,114
- and a new wing for the orphanage.
- I'm sure he's very kind to his mother.

342
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:00,700
Don't know his mother.

343
00:45:02,535 --> 00:45:05,246
You're not going to make
any trouble, are you?

344
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:07,957
Let's face it,
your reputation has preceded you.

345
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:11,294
- Do I look like I would make trouble?
- Well, yes, frankly.

346
00:45:11,419 --> 00:45:15,173
You'll jeopardise the tourist trade
if you go around killing people.

347
00:45:15,256 --> 00:45:17,884
Nigel, please. Just go back to your desk.

348
00:45:17,967 --> 00:45:23,014
Find out where Largo's boat is at the
moment. Call me later. I'll be at my hotel.

349
00:45:23,098 --> 00:45:26,017
Jolly good. I'll get onto that at once.

350
00:45:28,269 --> 00:45:31,606
And take full advantage
of the natural cover.

351
00:45:44,202 --> 00:45:48,039
- Is this The Flying Saucer?
- Yeah. It sailed this morning.

352
00:46:35,795 --> 00:46:37,839
Oh!

353
00:46:39,341 --> 00:46:42,427
How reckless of me! I made you all wet.

354
00:46:42,552 --> 00:46:45,805
Yes, but my martini's still dry.
My name's James.

355
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:49,142
Hello, James. I'm Fatima Blush.

356
00:46:49,225 --> 00:46:51,269
You ski very well.

357
00:46:51,394 --> 00:46:53,521
I do many things very well.

358
00:46:53,646 --> 00:46:55,690
I'm sure you do.

359
00:46:59,194 --> 00:47:02,197
- What brings you to Nassau, James?
- I'm fishing.

360
00:47:02,322 --> 00:47:04,783
- For what?
- Anything I can get.

361
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:10,914
I know the best waters.
I'd be very happy to show them to you.

362
00:47:10,997 --> 00:47:12,624
Why would you do that?

363
00:47:12,707 --> 00:47:15,794
I'd like you to find what you're looking for.

364
00:47:19,464 --> 00:47:21,925
I'm all yours.

365
00:47:27,389 --> 00:47:30,725
- Yes?
- James, would you come down please?

366
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:32,894
Right away.

367
00:47:41,361 --> 00:47:44,864
Ah! I think this should
take care of you perfectly.

368
00:47:44,948 --> 00:47:47,409
Oh, I'm sure it will.

369
00:47:47,492 --> 00:47:51,162
- You're marvellously well-equipped.
- Thank you, James.

370
00:47:52,455 --> 00:47:55,709
- So are you.
- Thank you.

371
00:47:56,918 --> 00:47:59,879
What exactly are we going down for?

372
00:48:00,547 --> 00:48:03,633
Sport... and a little fun.

373
00:48:06,344 --> 00:48:09,055
You... you appear tense.

374
00:48:10,181 --> 00:48:12,642
You affect me, James.

375
00:48:13,977 --> 00:48:16,021
Well, that's bad.

376
00:48:16,813 --> 00:48:20,066
Going down,
one should always be relaxed.

377
00:48:22,235 --> 00:48:24,362
Is it far to the reef?

378
00:48:24,487 --> 00:48:26,531
It's far enough.

379
00:48:28,283 --> 00:48:30,326
We've got time to kill.

380
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:32,337
- It's you!
- Well, you did say you'd catch me later.

381
00:53:52,774 --> 00:53:55,318
Oh, my God!

382
00:54:44,951 --> 00:54:47,495
- 623 and...
- 728.

383
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:49,622
728.

384
00:54:50,999 --> 00:54:53,668
Here you are. No messages.

385
00:55:26,034 --> 00:55:29,704
- Hello?
{y:bi}- Mr Bond! I've finally tracked you down!

386
00:55:29,788 --> 00:55:33,875
Small-Fawcett here. I hope I haven't
caught you at an awkward moment.

387
00:55:33,958 --> 00:55:38,004
No, not at all. Just be brief.
I don't have too much time.

388
00:55:38,088 --> 00:55:40,882
{y:bi}Just want you to know
{y:bi}that I'm on top of things.

389
00:55:40,965 --> 00:55:45,428
I've found out that Largo's boat is
en route for the south of France.

390
00:55:45,553 --> 00:55:48,431
- Well done.
- Oh, it was nothing, really.

391
00:55:48,515 --> 00:55:51,601
If you're free tomorrow,
why don't we go snorkelling?

392
00:55:51,726 --> 00:55:55,397
- Sounds a wonderful idea.
{y:bi}- Oh, jolly good, Bond!

393
00:55:57,774 --> 00:56:00,068
{y:bi}Because I was wanting
{y:bi}to discuss with you...

394
00:56:04,572 --> 00:56:07,033
- What's that?
- Mr Bond?

395
00:56:08,993 --> 00:56:12,914
- Proof that we made the right decision.
- About what, darling?

396
00:56:12,997 --> 00:56:15,041
Your place or mine.

397
00:57:03,965 --> 00:57:07,302
I found a villa for us
just where you wanted. It's perfect!

398
00:57:07,427 --> 00:57:10,680
The Flying Saucer is
anchored in the bay below.

399
00:57:10,805 --> 00:57:12,849
And Q sent this.

400
00:57:13,683 --> 00:57:15,727
Thank you.

401
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:24,819
- Gotcha!
- Get down!

402
00:57:26,488 --> 00:57:28,531
- Felix!
- Not bad.

403
00:57:28,656 --> 00:57:32,869
Not bad at all. Nothin' wrong with
your reflexes. How you doin', buddy?

404
00:57:32,952 --> 00:57:36,706
- What the hell are you doing here?
- CIA sent me to ride shotgun with you.

405
00:57:36,831 --> 00:57:38,541
- 326.
- How do you do?

406
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:42,462
- Excuse my inexperience. Nicole.
- I'm Felix Leiter. Enchanté.

407
00:57:42,545 --> 00:57:45,256
Thank you. My car is right there.

408
00:57:45,882 --> 00:57:48,426
I ran some checks
in the Langley computer.

409
00:57:48,551 --> 00:57:51,554
- Anything on Largo?
- No, he's squeaky-clean.

410
00:57:51,638 --> 00:57:54,641
I must say, for once
your hunch was wrong, buddy.

411
00:57:54,766 --> 00:57:57,310
- Ho-ho! Algernon, right?
- Yes.

412
00:57:57,435 --> 00:58:00,355
I had the first one of those,
and it blew up in my face.

413
00:58:00,438 --> 00:58:03,858
A motorbike came for you
from England. Here's the papers.

414
00:58:10,907 --> 00:58:13,785
- What are you gonna do with it?
- I'll know when I test it.

415
00:58:13,868 --> 00:58:16,705
It's gonna be your ass, James.

416
00:58:16,788 --> 00:58:18,832
Thank you!

417
00:58:56,953 --> 00:58:59,080
- Felix!
- Yeah?

418
00:58:59,164 --> 00:59:01,207
Forget the soup.

419
00:59:03,418 --> 00:59:06,838
- Feast your eyes on that.
- What've you got here, James?

420
00:59:09,674 --> 00:59:14,304
- That's Largo's lady.
- Her name is Domino. Domino Petachi.

421
00:59:15,221 --> 00:59:19,267
Petachi. The air-force officer
killed in that car crash.

422
00:59:19,351 --> 00:59:23,563
- Jack Petachi.
- That's right. He was her brother.

423
00:59:24,022 --> 00:59:26,483
Well, there's the man himself.

424
00:59:26,566 --> 00:59:29,819
If he's got the bombs, do you think
he'd have them on his yacht?

425
00:59:29,944 --> 00:59:34,324
Unlikely. But get some scuba gear.
We'll check her out.

426
00:59:34,407 --> 00:59:37,410
- Right.
- Hmm.

427
01:00:15,031 --> 01:00:17,492
{y:bi}Oui. On a tout ce que vous voulez.

428
01:00:17,617 --> 01:00:20,078
{y:bi}Bon. Au revoir, madame.

429
01:00:21,996 --> 01:00:27,752
Merci. Welcome to the Centre de la Santé.
I hope you enjoy our facilities.

430
01:00:27,877 --> 01:00:29,921
{y:bi}Merci.

431
01:00:31,965 --> 01:00:34,926
{y:bi}- Bonjour.
{y:bi}- Bonjour, monsieur.

432
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:38,513
- Do you serve men here?
- But of course.

433
01:00:38,596 --> 01:00:41,141
Some men more than others.

434
01:01:17,385 --> 01:01:21,431
Miss Petachi! No one told me
you were here. I am sorry.

435
01:01:22,349 --> 01:01:26,102
- You speak English, yes?
- Yes. Quite well, in fact.

436
01:01:27,145 --> 01:01:30,815
Now... Hard or soft massage?

437
01:01:31,399 --> 01:01:33,443
Oh, hard, please.

438
01:01:34,194 --> 01:01:38,281
Well, perhaps we should
begin with your back.

439
01:01:44,621 --> 01:01:49,417
I... don't believe we've seen
you around here before.

440
01:01:51,878 --> 01:01:54,589
No, I was on a boat.

441
01:01:54,673 --> 01:01:58,093
Ah. And what boat would that be?

442
01:01:58,218 --> 01:02:01,471
- Oh, The Flying Saucer.
- Oh!

443
01:02:01,554 --> 01:02:05,058
- Mr Largo's boat.
- Yes. Do you know Mr Largo?

444
01:02:05,767 --> 01:02:07,811
Oh, I know of him.

445
01:02:08,687 --> 01:02:12,107
I know he owns many beautiful things.

446
01:02:14,609 --> 01:02:17,529
Yes, he's a very generous man, Mr Largo.

447
01:02:17,612 --> 01:02:19,823
I'm sure he is.

448
01:02:19,948 --> 01:02:25,078
He's giving a charity ball tonight
at the casino, for children.

449
01:02:25,203 --> 01:02:28,123
- What a worthy cause.
- Mm.

450
01:02:28,206 --> 01:02:30,750
Perhaps I should attend.

451
01:02:30,875 --> 01:02:34,462
I'd really like to ask you. I would.

452
01:02:34,546 --> 01:02:38,925
But I'm afraid the guest list
is very restricted. I'm sorry.

453
01:02:42,053 --> 01:02:44,097
{y:bi}C'est la vie.

454
01:02:44,681 --> 01:02:46,725
{y:bi}C'est la vie?

455
01:02:48,893 --> 01:02:51,104
Such is life.

456
01:02:53,606 --> 01:02:56,151
Such is life.

457
01:03:03,742 --> 01:03:06,202
Mm, that feels so good!

458
01:03:08,621 --> 01:03:10,498
It certainly does.

459
01:03:11,708 --> 01:03:13,752
Excuse me?

460
01:03:13,877 --> 01:03:17,047
It certainly does need it. You have...

461
01:03:18,131 --> 01:03:21,384
slight lesions in the upper vertebrae.

462
01:03:21,509 --> 01:03:23,386
Oh.

463
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:31,144
Oh!

464
01:03:31,269 --> 01:03:34,272
Could you go a little lower, please?

465
01:03:34,898 --> 01:03:37,359
- Lower?
- Yes, please.

466
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:40,362
Please.

467
01:03:41,738 --> 01:03:44,449
Oh! Right there.

468
01:03:50,789 --> 01:03:53,625
Oh, that feels so good!

469
01:03:55,335 --> 01:03:57,212
{y:bi}- Bonjour.
{y:bi}- Bonjour, monsieur.

470
01:03:57,295 --> 01:04:01,049
I am sorry, mademoiselle.
We are so very busy today.

471
01:04:02,425 --> 01:04:05,345
- Where'd the masseur go?
- Who?

472
01:04:05,428 --> 01:04:09,808
- The man, the masseur.
- The man I pass? He does not work here.

473
01:04:33,415 --> 01:04:36,292
They'll never let you in.
I'd better wait for you.

474
01:04:36,376 --> 01:04:39,087
{y:bi}No, Nicole. Go back to the villa.

475
01:04:43,925 --> 01:04:46,845
- Find that villa!
{y:bi}- Oui, mademoiselle.

476
01:05:00,358 --> 01:05:03,153
{y:bi}Monsieur?
Wait a minute! You there!

477
01:05:14,164 --> 01:05:16,624
I shouldn't have the fish.

478
01:05:19,002 --> 01:05:24,841
You must have an unreasonable fear of
gatecrashers to carry this heavy artillery.

479
01:05:26,676 --> 01:05:30,513
This bomb has a tiny gyroscope inside.

480
01:05:30,638 --> 01:05:36,269
Any lateral movement on your part
and you could be served in an egg cup.

481
01:05:36,353 --> 01:05:40,732
If you understand what's being
explained to you, nod gently.

482
01:05:42,484 --> 01:05:44,694
Good boy. Stay.

483
01:07:51,988 --> 01:07:56,534
Hello again. I do owe you an explanation.

484
01:07:57,077 --> 01:07:59,913
My name is Bond. James Bond.

485
01:08:01,498 --> 01:08:03,958
May I offer you a drink?

486
01:08:19,766 --> 01:08:22,519
- Hard or soft?
- Soft.

487
01:08:22,602 --> 01:08:26,022
A double Bloody Mary with
plenty of Worcestershire sauce.

488
01:08:26,106 --> 01:08:29,275
I hate to think what you mean
by hard. Vodka on the rocks.

489
01:08:49,921 --> 01:08:51,965
I think you have lost her.

490
01:08:52,090 --> 01:08:57,137
Do you imagine that I could lose a woman
to an underpaid British agent? Ja?

491
01:08:57,262 --> 01:08:59,639
Ja. And I warn you,

492
01:08:59,764 --> 01:09:04,144
if he's not executed at once,
he'll have your Domino turned over.

493
01:09:04,269 --> 01:09:08,815
Is it possible that you have bungled
your attempts because you want him...

494
01:09:09,816 --> 01:09:11,860
for yourself? Hm?

495
01:09:14,821 --> 01:09:19,200
Maximillian, why torture yourself
over that kind of woman?

496
01:09:19,325 --> 01:09:22,245
Maybe one day
you have to kill her, Fatima.

497
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:27,834
Your sense of humour is delicious.

498
01:09:27,917 --> 01:09:30,378
What's your brother up to these days?

499
01:09:30,503 --> 01:09:34,007
He's on his way here.
Oh, I can't wait to see him.

500
01:09:36,051 --> 01:09:38,261
- How do you know my brother?
- Hello!

501
01:09:38,345 --> 01:09:41,097
You must be Mr James Bond, right?

502
01:09:41,765 --> 01:09:44,059
Monsieur Largo.

503
01:09:44,184 --> 01:09:45,435
Yes. Right.

504
01:09:45,518 --> 01:09:48,063
Are you a man who enjoys games?

505
01:09:48,563 --> 01:09:51,441
It depends with whom I'm playing.

506
01:09:51,524 --> 01:09:53,651
Ja. Shall we?

507
01:09:53,735 --> 01:09:55,779
Join us.

508
01:09:58,198 --> 01:10:02,285
These are my friends. They honoured me
by coming from all over the world

509
01:10:02,369 --> 01:10:04,662
to give money to my favourite charity.

510
01:10:04,746 --> 01:10:07,582
- And what might that be?
- Orphan children.

511
01:10:07,665 --> 01:10:10,752
So... here we are.

512
01:10:11,753 --> 01:10:15,507
The game is called Domination.
I designed it myself.

513
01:10:16,466 --> 01:10:22,305
But my problem is, I've never
yet found a worthy adversary.

514
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:25,350
No doubt I shall disappoint you too.

515
01:10:26,976 --> 01:10:29,020
We'll see.

516
01:10:30,772 --> 01:10:32,816
Darling?

517
01:10:36,111 --> 01:10:39,698
This game has one objective: power.

518
01:10:43,618 --> 01:10:48,081
We will be fighting for countries,
chosen at random by the machine.

519
01:10:48,164 --> 01:10:52,460
But for this demonstration
I will choose France.

520
01:10:52,585 --> 01:10:55,755
Target areas will light up on the map.

521
01:10:55,839 --> 01:10:59,843
Whoever hits them first with
his laser beam will score points.

522
01:10:59,926 --> 01:11:02,220
But there is another way to win.

523
01:11:02,345 --> 01:11:05,765
With the left hand,
you control two nuclear missiles.

524
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:09,728
With the right hand, you control
a shield to block my missiles.

525
01:11:09,811 --> 01:11:13,231
But if you fail... Boom! I win the game.

526
01:11:13,982 --> 01:11:16,526
You will be red. I will be blue.

527
01:11:17,944 --> 01:11:20,071
Are you ready?

528
01:11:20,155 --> 01:11:21,740
Yes.

529
01:11:24,784 --> 01:11:26,578
Begin.

530
01:11:26,703 --> 01:11:30,999
{y:bi}Thank you, gentlemen. Eternal battle
{y:bi}for the domination of the world begins.

531
01:11:31,124 --> 01:11:34,961
- We play for dollars.
{y:bi}- Random target selection: Spain.

532
01:11:35,045 --> 01:11:37,088
{y:bi}Value: $9,000.

533
01:11:37,797 --> 01:11:39,674
{y:bi}Play.

534
01:11:48,224 --> 01:11:50,101
{y:bi}Blue wins $9,000.

535
01:11:50,185 --> 01:11:53,438
- It gave me a shock.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot.

536
01:11:53,521 --> 01:11:57,442
Unlike armchair generals,
we will share the pain of our soldiers,

537
01:11:57,525 --> 01:12:00,195
in the form of electric shocks.

538
01:12:00,278 --> 01:12:05,867
One last point: if you let go
of the controls, you forfeit the game.

539
01:12:05,950 --> 01:12:10,580
As you were unaware of this,
we will begin again.

540
01:12:12,791 --> 01:12:15,085
{y:bi}Reset. Thank you.

541
01:12:18,296 --> 01:12:22,926
{y:bi}Random target selection: Japan.
{y:bi}Value: $16,000.

542
01:12:24,094 --> 01:12:27,180
{y:bi}- Play.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

543
01:12:40,819 --> 01:12:43,613
{y:bi}Blue wins $16,000.

544
01:12:43,697 --> 01:12:47,450
A lucky move on my part.
Perhaps I didn't explain.

545
01:12:47,534 --> 01:12:51,287
As the stakes increase,
so does the level of pain.

546
01:12:51,371 --> 01:12:54,874
Rather like life. We continue?

547
01:12:58,294 --> 01:13:00,005
Of course.

548
01:13:01,256 --> 01:13:02,882
Good.

549
01:13:04,634 --> 01:13:07,887
{y:bi}Eternal battle for
{y:bi}the domination of the world begins.

550
01:13:08,013 --> 01:13:10,640
{y:bi}Random target selection:
{y:bi}the United States.

551
01:13:10,724 --> 01:13:13,184
{y:bi}Value: $42,000. Play.

552
01:13:33,538 --> 01:13:35,665
{y:bi}Red pain level at 50%.

553
01:13:36,499 --> 01:13:39,461
{y:bi}Danger level. Repeat. Dangerlevel.

554
01:13:55,352 --> 01:13:57,562
{y:bi}60%.

555
01:13:57,687 --> 01:13:59,731
{y:bi}65%.

556
01:14:03,068 --> 01:14:05,111
{y:bi}Red pain level: 80%.

557
01:14:05,987 --> 01:14:08,031
{y:bi}Danger. Danger.

558
01:14:08,823 --> 01:14:10,617
{y:bi}Danger.

559
01:14:11,576 --> 01:14:13,536
Domino.

560
01:14:13,661 --> 01:14:15,872
Excuse me.

561
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:31,304
Are you all right?

562
01:14:31,930 --> 01:14:33,973
Fine.

563
01:14:35,266 --> 01:14:37,310
You lost $58,000.

564
01:14:38,228 --> 01:14:41,189
It goes, of course, to my charity.

565
01:14:41,272 --> 01:14:44,859
I think it's better if we don't continue.

566
01:14:49,447 --> 01:14:52,701
Can we play one more game
for the rest of the world?

567
01:14:56,121 --> 01:14:58,415
Win or lose?

568
01:14:59,416 --> 01:15:01,960
You know what that could mean?

569
01:15:06,131 --> 01:15:08,258
Yes.

570
01:15:08,383 --> 01:15:10,427
Good.

571
01:15:22,272 --> 01:15:24,566
- Best of luck.
- You too.

572
01:15:24,649 --> 01:15:27,652
{y:bi}Final game.
{y:bi}Remaining countries of the world.

573
01:15:27,777 --> 01:15:30,238
{y:bi}Value: $325,000.

574
01:15:31,364 --> 01:15:33,408
{y:bi}Play.

575
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:56,723
{y:bi}Blue missile destroyed.
{y:bi}Blue pain level: 50%.

576
01:15:56,806 --> 01:15:59,809
{y:bi}Danger level. Repeat. Danger level.

577
01:16:01,978 --> 01:16:04,731
{y:bi}Second blue missile destroyed.

578
01:16:05,982 --> 01:16:08,360
{y:bi}Blue pain level: 55%. Danger.

579
01:16:08,443 --> 01:16:10,737
- Max!
{y:bi}- 65%.

580
01:16:12,906 --> 01:16:15,200
{y:bi}Blue pain level: 70%.

581
01:16:16,826 --> 01:16:18,787
{y:bi}- Pain level at 80%.
- Max!

582
01:16:18,870 --> 01:16:20,914
{y:bi}85%. Danger. Danger.

583
01:16:20,997 --> 01:16:22,957
- Max!
{y:bi}- Danger.

584
01:16:32,092 --> 01:16:34,135
Excuse me.

585
01:16:37,389 --> 01:16:40,975
It seems I underestimated you.

586
01:16:43,353 --> 01:16:47,649
$267,000.

587
01:16:47,732 --> 01:16:50,402
I'll settle for one dance with Domino.

588
01:16:50,485 --> 01:16:52,529
So...

589
01:16:53,321 --> 01:16:57,158
Do you lose as gracefully as you win?

590
01:16:57,283 --> 01:17:01,371
- I wouldn't know. I've never lost.
- This game has been played,

591
01:17:01,454 --> 01:17:04,124
and I have lost. That's it.

592
01:17:08,044 --> 01:17:11,631
- He's never gone this far before.
- He's certifiable.

593
01:17:12,132 --> 01:17:14,843
- A tango, yes?
{y:bi}- Oui, monsieur.

594
01:17:45,874 --> 01:17:48,335
What is it you're after?

595
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:56,301
- In part, it's about your brother.
- What about my brother?

596
01:17:58,470 --> 01:18:00,597
Did you know he was working for Largo?

597
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:03,933
That's impossible.
Jack is in the US air force.

598
01:18:04,059 --> 01:18:06,978
That's precisely why Largo used him.

599
01:18:11,232 --> 01:18:13,276
Your brother's dead.

600
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:17,822
Keep dancing. Largo is the prime suspect.

601
01:18:19,115 --> 01:18:21,493
Your brother was used and eliminated.

602
01:18:37,425 --> 01:18:40,345
They move well together, don't they?

603
01:18:43,598 --> 01:18:46,059
Today you have another chance.

604
01:18:46,935 --> 01:18:49,396
This time you'd better not fail.

605
01:18:50,689 --> 01:18:52,732
Number 12.

606
01:19:23,638 --> 01:19:25,849
Excellent.

607
01:19:25,974 --> 01:19:30,520
- You dance amazingly well, Mr Bond.
- Oh, it's Domino, really.

608
01:19:30,603 --> 01:19:33,064
- She's such a pleasure to follow.
- I know.

609
01:19:33,148 --> 01:19:35,275
I'd love to have you for lunch.

610
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:39,529
If you are still around tomorrow,
why don't you join us on our boat?

611
01:19:39,612 --> 01:19:42,073
- Tomorrow's not good for me.
- Why?

612
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:46,077
- I'm going to pick up Jack.
- That's not possible.

613
01:19:46,161 --> 01:19:49,039
Jack phoned earlier to say
he'd been delayed again.

614
01:19:49,122 --> 01:19:52,042
At least for another week, maybe two.

615
01:19:52,876 --> 01:19:54,919
Bye-bye.

616
01:20:01,176 --> 01:20:03,219
Thank you very much.

617
01:21:09,452 --> 01:21:11,496
Nicole?

618
01:22:02,172 --> 01:22:04,549
Nicole!

619
01:23:34,389 --> 01:23:36,099
Don't touch him! He's mine!

620
01:24:14,054 --> 01:24:15,764
Come on, come on!

621
01:24:20,226 --> 01:24:21,936
Ha!

622
01:24:29,569 --> 01:24:31,613
{y:bi}Quel homme imbécile!

623
01:26:12,672 --> 01:26:14,215
Hold it!

624
01:26:24,351 --> 01:26:26,394
Sit up.

625
01:26:29,522 --> 01:26:31,566
Your gun.

626
01:26:33,026 --> 01:26:35,070
Carefully!

627
01:26:38,823 --> 01:26:40,867
Over here.

628
01:26:45,789 --> 01:26:47,665
Spread your legs.

629
01:26:55,131 --> 01:26:57,425
Good. Very good.

630
01:27:00,553 --> 01:27:03,098
You're quite a man, Mr James Bond.

631
01:27:04,265 --> 01:27:06,935
But I am a superior woman.

632
01:27:10,021 --> 01:27:12,941
Guess where you get the first one.

633
01:27:15,443 --> 01:27:18,780
- Well, in view of your hatred of men...
- Liar!

634
01:27:19,823 --> 01:27:25,036
You know that making love to Fatima
was the greatest pleasure of your life.

635
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:27,580
Well, to be perfectly honest,

636
01:27:28,373 --> 01:27:31,793
- there was this girl in Philadelphia...
- Shut up!

637
01:27:33,461 --> 01:27:35,755
- I am the best.
- Yes.

638
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:38,091
Yes, you're right. In fact,

639
01:27:38,174 --> 01:27:42,012
I was going to put you in
my memoirs as number one.

640
01:27:43,263 --> 01:27:45,306
All right.

641
01:27:56,860 --> 01:27:58,903
Write!

642
01:28:07,037 --> 01:28:09,581
Now write this...

643
01:28:10,331 --> 01:28:15,670
The greatest rapture in my life was
afforded me in a boat in Nassau

644
01:28:15,754 --> 01:28:17,797
by Fatima Blush.

645
01:28:19,007 --> 01:28:21,301
Signed, James Bond,

646
01:28:22,135 --> 01:28:24,179
007.

647
01:28:28,224 --> 01:28:31,811
I just remembered.
It's against service policy

648
01:28:31,936 --> 01:28:34,898
- for agents to give out endorsements.
- Write!

649
01:28:37,484 --> 01:28:39,361
Right now?

650
01:28:39,444 --> 01:28:41,738
Right now.

651
01:29:15,230 --> 01:29:17,524
Not perfected yet?!

652
01:29:23,697 --> 01:29:26,157
{y:bi}Eh, vous, là-bas, arrêtez!

653
01:29:33,915 --> 01:29:37,961
Good show, James!
Q actually came through, didn't he?

654
01:29:38,044 --> 01:29:41,047
- How long have you been here?
- Long enough.

655
01:29:41,172 --> 01:29:44,676
- Long enough for what?
- To see how you handled the lady.

656
01:29:46,344 --> 01:29:48,388
Come on! This way!

657
01:29:57,355 --> 01:29:59,816
{y:bi}Allez! Un, deux.

658
01:29:59,899 --> 01:30:01,693
{y:bi}Un, deux.

659
01:30:01,776 --> 01:30:03,820
{y:bi}Un, deux...

660
01:31:26,986 --> 01:31:29,531
Monsieur Largo is waiting for you, sir.

661
01:31:29,614 --> 01:31:31,908
But of course. Thank you.

662
01:31:49,426 --> 01:31:51,469
This way, sir.

663
01:32:11,281 --> 01:32:16,494
{y:bi}Permission de partir?. Oui. Dans quelle
{y:bi}direction? Par là ou par là? A droite. Oui.

664
01:32:16,578 --> 01:32:18,621
Hello!

665
01:32:19,581 --> 01:32:22,459
Good morning.
You are a bit early for lunch.

666
01:32:22,542 --> 01:32:26,296
- I know. It's rather embarrassing.
- Prepare for departure.

667
01:32:26,421 --> 01:32:31,051
- Steward, get some clothes for my guest.
- I'm overwhelmed.

668
01:32:31,176 --> 01:32:35,472
- I'm invited for lunch and given a cruise.
- Why? You had other plans?

669
01:32:35,555 --> 01:32:39,559
- No, not at all. I'm at your disposal.
- Of course. Cigarette?

670
01:32:39,642 --> 01:32:41,686
No, not today, thank you.

671
01:32:41,811 --> 01:32:43,688
So...

672
01:32:43,813 --> 01:32:46,274
- A drink?
- A vodka martini?

673
01:32:48,568 --> 01:32:49,569
Of course.

674
01:33:08,129 --> 01:33:11,966
This is my situation room.
From here, the world comes to me.

675
01:33:12,050 --> 01:33:17,263
- You could run a small government.
- Oh, no, I could run a large government.

676
01:33:17,847 --> 01:33:20,308
- What's your latest venture?
- Oil.

677
01:33:20,975 --> 01:33:26,815
A new departure, besides which my other
enterprises are of little consequence.

678
01:33:26,898 --> 01:33:31,277
Well, if it's that big, let's hope
it doesn't blow up in your face.

679
01:33:31,361 --> 01:33:33,238
Mr Bond! Excuse me.

680
01:33:33,363 --> 01:33:35,907
I have work to do. Time is money.

681
01:33:35,990 --> 01:33:39,077
By the way, the staterooms are aft.

682
01:33:41,538 --> 01:33:44,874
Don't forget... 12 o'clock... Iunch.

683
01:33:47,544 --> 01:33:49,587
Mr Bond...

684
01:33:50,714 --> 01:33:52,757
Enjoy the ship.

685
01:34:23,455 --> 01:34:25,498
Mr Bond!

686
01:34:26,624 --> 01:34:28,752
There's fresh clothes in your cabin.

687
01:34:28,877 --> 01:34:31,963
- If you'd like to follow me...
- Thank you.

688
01:34:51,107 --> 01:34:53,401
What happened to my brother?

689
01:34:53,526 --> 01:34:55,987
- Why are you here?
- Just trust me.

690
01:35:30,271 --> 01:35:34,109
"The Tears of Allah."
Does that mean anything to you?

691
01:35:41,825 --> 01:35:43,868
This is it.

692
01:35:44,411 --> 01:35:46,955
He gave it to me.

693
01:35:47,038 --> 01:35:50,291
- He said it was very valuable.
- It doesn't look it.

694
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:54,671
Have you any idea where we're heading?

695
01:35:54,754 --> 01:35:58,174
North Africa. He's got a house,
a place called Palmyra.

696
01:36:01,386 --> 01:36:04,389
Somehow I've got to
transmit a message out of here.

697
01:36:04,472 --> 01:36:07,892
It could be risky,
but I'm going to need your help.

698
01:36:07,976 --> 01:36:11,479
- What do you want me to do?
- I'm going to kiss you.

699
01:36:11,563 --> 01:36:14,190
I want you to respond as if you liked it.

700
01:36:14,274 --> 01:36:16,735
I'm doing this for two very good reasons.

701
01:36:16,860 --> 01:36:20,363
One, because I'm hoping
to provoke a reaction.

702
01:36:21,239 --> 01:36:23,366
And the other one?

703
01:36:23,450 --> 01:36:25,910
Because I always wanted to.

704
01:38:00,588 --> 01:38:04,092
{y:bi}False alarm! False alarm!

705
01:38:04,217 --> 01:38:07,053
{y:bi}All crew return to stations.

706
01:38:10,306 --> 01:38:14,769
We've had a message from one of our
ships in the Med. I think it's from Bond.

707
01:38:14,853 --> 01:38:18,523
- About time.
- He used emergency code Tango Zebra.

708
01:38:19,065 --> 01:38:22,986
- "Heading North Africa, Palmyra."
- Palmyra? Where is that?

709
01:38:23,111 --> 01:38:25,405
Haven't a clue, sir.

710
01:38:26,322 --> 01:38:29,284
Well, find out about it, will you?

711
01:38:29,367 --> 01:38:31,661
I'll do my best, sir.

712
01:38:31,786 --> 01:38:33,288
North Africa?

713
01:38:44,674 --> 01:38:47,385
- Quite impressive, huh?
- Very.

714
01:38:48,261 --> 01:38:52,807
That's my retreat, where I can escape
and enjoy all my treasures.

715
01:39:09,991 --> 01:39:12,035
How do you like...

716
01:39:12,994 --> 01:39:15,914
your new home, my princess?

717
01:39:34,015 --> 01:39:36,851
Bond, the game is over. Take him away.

718
01:39:36,935 --> 01:39:38,978
{y:bi}Et doucement!

719
01:39:54,577 --> 01:39:57,497
That belonged to Napoleon's empress.

720
01:39:59,874 --> 01:40:02,335
That is my greatest treasure.

721
01:40:03,545 --> 01:40:05,338
Take it.

722
01:40:05,422 --> 01:40:07,716
Take it. But be careful.

723
01:40:11,928 --> 01:40:15,432
That is your... wedding present.

724
01:40:20,979 --> 01:40:23,440
You betrayed me.

725
01:40:24,065 --> 01:40:26,526
But I forgive you.

726
01:40:28,194 --> 01:40:30,655
And what about my brother?

727
01:40:32,824 --> 01:40:34,868
Your brother...

728
01:40:37,328 --> 01:40:40,665
I hate you. I hate you.

729
01:40:50,133 --> 01:40:52,177
Oh, Domino!

730
01:40:52,844 --> 01:40:56,765
- Domino!
- You're crazy.

731
01:40:57,265 --> 01:40:59,392
Ja, maybe...

732
01:40:59,517 --> 01:41:01,561
I'm crazy.

733
01:42:05,458 --> 01:42:07,502
What a wonderful view.

734
01:42:08,837 --> 01:42:10,880
You'll see.

735
01:42:13,758 --> 01:42:16,428
Every game has to have a winner.

736
01:42:16,511 --> 01:42:18,555
So...

737
01:42:20,181 --> 01:42:22,225
{y:bi}Ciao, bello!

738
01:42:23,476 --> 01:42:25,937
- Largo.
- Bond.

739
01:42:26,021 --> 01:42:28,940
In that case,
where did you hide the bombs?

740
01:42:30,316 --> 01:42:34,696
You still think of escape?
I must say, I admire your spirit.

741
01:42:36,156 --> 01:42:38,366
Well...

742
01:42:38,491 --> 01:42:42,245
Bomb number one is
right under the president's feet...

743
01:42:43,204 --> 01:42:45,331
in Washington DC.

744
01:42:45,457 --> 01:42:47,751
And number two?

745
01:42:52,130 --> 01:42:55,133
You were a very good secret agent.

746
01:42:55,550 --> 01:42:57,594
Really.

747
01:42:59,637 --> 01:43:01,681
Bye.

748
01:43:20,742 --> 01:43:23,453
I'm sure this will amuse you.

749
01:43:35,382 --> 01:43:37,425
Goodbye, Domino.

750
01:45:14,647 --> 01:45:16,691
Cover it up.

751
01:48:10,615 --> 01:48:14,035
- Hold on!
- Whoa! What are you doing?

752
01:48:14,661 --> 01:48:15,662
James!

753
01:49:15,805 --> 01:49:20,060
- You're a hard man to keep up with!
- Clear the line to Washington, Felix.

754
01:49:20,143 --> 01:49:22,604
That's where the first bomb is.

755
01:49:43,416 --> 01:49:46,503
It was never like this
when I was in the navy.

756
01:49:51,758 --> 01:49:53,802
Here we are.

757
01:49:59,182 --> 01:50:01,226
What's the matter?

758
01:50:03,228 --> 01:50:06,398
You're going back after Largo, aren't you?

759
01:50:06,523 --> 01:50:08,566
Well, I have to.

760
01:50:13,571 --> 01:50:16,324
I want him as much as you do.

761
01:50:16,408 --> 01:50:19,994
Probably more.
I can understand you hating him.

762
01:50:26,626 --> 01:50:31,006
Well, maybe... maybe I don't hate him
enough to risk losing you.

763
01:50:33,299 --> 01:50:36,386
But I don't want to risk losing me, either.

764
01:50:40,390 --> 01:50:44,602
{y:bi}Commander Bond,
{y:bi}the Washington bomb has been defused.

765
01:50:44,686 --> 01:50:48,189
{y:bi}Now, sir, from London,
{y:bi}your chief wants to speak to you.

766
01:50:48,314 --> 01:50:52,527
{y:bi}This is M. We've cracked the code
{y:bi}for disarming the warheads,

767
01:50:52,610 --> 01:50:56,656
{y:bi}but we've only got five hours
{y:bi}to find the second bomb.

768
01:50:56,740 --> 01:51:01,870
{y:bi}Now, as you perfectly well know,
{y:bi}I have absolute confidence in you, and I...

769
01:51:01,995 --> 01:51:06,166
- That's what kept me going, sir.
{y:bi}- All right, then, I'll be brief with you.

770
01:51:06,249 --> 01:51:08,710
{y:bi}I know you've got your hands full.

771
01:51:08,793 --> 01:51:13,006
{y:bi}If you should come through
{y:bi}this fearful ordeal unscathed,

772
01:51:13,089 --> 01:51:16,926
{y:bi}I'd like to offer you
{y:bi}lunch at my club. Over.

773
01:51:17,969 --> 01:51:21,389
That's a thrilling prospect, sir.

774
01:51:21,514 --> 01:51:23,975
But if I do get through this,

775
01:51:25,477 --> 01:51:27,937
I may have other plans.

776
01:51:39,824 --> 01:51:42,535
- Steady at 300.
- Steady at 300.

777
01:51:43,620 --> 01:51:45,246
There she is, sir!

778
01:51:45,330 --> 01:51:47,957
- What's she reading?
- Seven fathoms, sir.

779
01:51:48,750 --> 01:51:52,253
No way we can get in there.
The water's too shallow.

780
01:51:53,838 --> 01:51:56,841
Nothing. Nothing moving on board.

781
01:51:58,385 --> 01:52:01,888
AWAC surveillance reports
no sightings on shore.

782
01:52:02,722 --> 01:52:05,517
Now why did Largo anchor here?

783
01:52:08,770 --> 01:52:11,231
Your pendant. Give it to me.

784
01:52:17,487 --> 01:52:19,614
This is "The Tears of Allah".

785
01:52:19,698 --> 01:52:23,868
The story goes that the prophet wept
and his tears made a well.

786
01:52:25,954 --> 01:52:28,164
The contours are the same.

787
01:52:28,248 --> 01:52:31,126
The diamond must mark a place.

788
01:52:31,209 --> 01:52:33,670
That would be about here.

789
01:52:35,130 --> 01:52:37,799
Right where the oilfields begin!

790
01:53:14,002 --> 01:53:17,255
Sir, there is underwater
activity in the area.

791
01:53:17,797 --> 01:53:20,508
Check the area for underwater caves.

792
01:53:40,153 --> 01:53:45,784
Sonar signals do indicate a cavity
below sea level at 015 degrees.

793
01:53:46,785 --> 01:53:49,079
There's an underground river there.

794
01:54:29,536 --> 01:54:34,249
Commander Pederson,
are you equipped with the new XT-7Bs?

795
01:54:34,374 --> 01:54:37,711
That's top secret.
How do you know about them?

796
01:54:39,212 --> 01:54:43,049
From a Russian translation
of one of your service manuals.

797
01:54:43,174 --> 01:54:45,468
Sorry about that.

798
01:54:48,471 --> 01:54:50,682
{y:bi}Ports open.

799
01:54:50,807 --> 01:54:52,767
{y:bi}Fire one!

800
01:54:52,892 --> 01:54:54,602
{y:bi}Fire two!

801
01:54:54,686 --> 01:54:56,730
{y:bi}Cut track.

802
01:57:01,187 --> 01:57:03,565
Be careful of the housing.

803
01:57:22,459 --> 01:57:24,502
Watch it!

804
01:58:01,498 --> 01:58:04,042
I've got to go in.

805
01:58:04,125 --> 01:58:06,169
We don't have much time.

806
01:58:06,294 --> 01:58:09,964
Give the sub our position
and get some help.

807
01:59:08,356 --> 01:59:10,817
Kovacs? Kovacs? Come.

808
01:59:12,277 --> 01:59:14,320
Here, look.

809
01:59:15,613 --> 01:59:17,657
Well done, Dr Kovacs.

810
01:59:17,741 --> 01:59:19,784
{y:bi}Go ahead. Go ahead.

811
01:59:21,286 --> 01:59:25,457
When the warhead is ready for
its final voyage, we will drink a toast.

812
01:59:25,540 --> 01:59:28,001
There is nothing
that can stop us any more.

813
01:59:47,103 --> 01:59:49,147
The guide rope! Keep the tension!

814
02:00:13,630 --> 02:00:15,674
The Tears of Allah.

815
02:00:20,762 --> 02:00:23,056
Sweet, like money.

816
02:00:23,682 --> 02:00:26,059
For years, it has been
a monument to power,

817
02:00:26,184 --> 02:00:29,521
but nothing like what we
now possess. Huh, Kovacs?

818
02:00:55,547 --> 02:00:58,383
Everybody stay undercover!
You, get up there!

819
02:01:35,587 --> 02:01:37,630
Leiter, stay down!

820
02:01:41,509 --> 02:01:45,638
What took you so long? Hold up on
the heavy stuff. Bond is still in there!

821
02:02:19,923 --> 02:02:21,633
It's armed.

822
02:03:56,186 --> 02:03:58,313
Largo got away with the warhead.

823
02:03:58,438 --> 02:04:02,650
Call down a chopper.
I'm going to try the oasis. Good luck.

824
02:04:02,734 --> 02:04:05,904
Bond's clear! We're movin' in!

825
02:08:29,876 --> 02:08:32,504
Ah! There you are.

826
02:08:32,587 --> 02:08:35,048
I always have a martini at five.

827
02:08:35,674 --> 02:08:38,218
You'll never give up
your old habits, James.

828
02:08:38,301 --> 02:08:42,055
No, you're wrong. Those days are over.

829
02:08:42,180 --> 02:08:44,474
Ah!

830
02:09:22,387 --> 02:09:23,388
Oh, no.

831
02:09:24,389 --> 02:09:27,809
I'm sorry, Mr Bond.
Obviously caught you at a bad moment.

832
02:09:27,934 --> 02:09:31,855
- M sent you.
- Only to plead for your return, sir.

833
02:09:31,980 --> 02:09:34,024
M says without you in the service

he fears for the security
of the civilised world.

835
02:09:37,444 --> 02:09:40,280
- Never again.
- Never?

836
02:09:40,363 --> 02:09:44,034
{y:bi}# Never, never say never again

837
02:09:44,117 --> 02:09:47,620
{y:bi}# Never, never say never again

838
02:10:07,098 --> 02:10:10,268
{y:bi}# You walk in a room

839
02:10:10,894 --> 02:10:13,813
{y:bi}# A woman can feel the heat

840
02:10:14,481 --> 02:10:17,400
{y:bi}# One look is a guarantee

841
02:10:17,484 --> 02:10:22,113
{y:bi}# Nights could be long and sweet

842
02:10:22,197 --> 02:10:25,200
{y:bi}# The message is clear

843
02:10:25,825 --> 02:10:28,828
{y:bi}# Like nothing I've ever known

844
02:10:29,537 --> 02:10:32,624
{y:bi}# But from all that I hear

845
02:10:33,375 --> 02:10:36,252
{y:bi}# Forget about long-range plans

846
02:10:36,336 --> 02:10:40,423
{y:bi}# Cos this man's got his own

847
02:10:40,882 --> 02:10:48,181
{y:bi}# To get mixed up with
{y:bi}a man who says never

848
02:10:49,724 --> 02:10:56,147
{y:bi}# May be big trouble, but then

849
02:10:56,272 --> 02:11:03,321
{y:bi}# I just could be the woman to take you

850
02:11:04,364 --> 02:11:09,411
{y:bi}# And make you never say never again

851
02:11:09,494 --> 02:11:12,747
{y:bi}# Never, never say never again

852
02:11:13,164 --> 02:11:16,501
{y:bi}# Never, never say never again

853
02:11:16,960 --> 02:11:20,213
{y:bi}# Never, never say never again

854
02:11:20,672 --> 02:11:24,175
{y:bi}# Never, never say never again

855
02:11:24,300 --> 02:11:27,303
{y:bi}# You've got all the moves

856
02:11:27,804 --> 02:11:30,890
{y:bi}# Ah, but baby I got 'em too

857
02:11:31,766 --> 02:11:36,396
{y:bi}# No matter your attitude or your mood

858
02:11:36,521 --> 02:11:39,315
{y:bi}# I'll come through

859
02:11:39,399 --> 02:11:42,986
{y:bi}# The touch of your voice

860
02:11:43,069 --> 02:11:46,072
{y:bi}# The feel of your eyes on me

861
02:11:46,781 --> 02:11:49,784
{y:bi}# You leave me no choice

862
02:11:50,702 --> 02:11:53,329
{y:bi}# Though I know there's danger there

863
02:11:53,413 --> 02:11:57,625
{y:bi}# I don't care, let it be

864
02:11:57,834 --> 02:12:05,550
{y:bi}# To get in bed with
{y:bi}a man who says never

865
02:12:06,843 --> 02:12:13,266
{y:bi}# May have no future, but then

866
02:12:13,350 --> 02:12:20,398
{y:bi}# I just could be the woman to reach you

867
02:12:21,441 --> 02:12:26,237
{y:bi}# And teach you to never say never again

868
02:12:27,822 --> 02:12:31,493
{y:bi}# I'll bet you, I'll get you

869
02:12:31,576 --> 02:12:35,246
{y:bi}# I'll reach you, I'll teach you

870
02:12:35,330 --> 02:12:41,670
{y:bi}# I'll take you, I'll make you
