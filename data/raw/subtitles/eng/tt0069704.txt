00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,288
Hey, what do you say, Curt?
Last night in town,

3
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,123
you guys gonna have a little
bash before you leave?

4
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,666
The Moose have been
looking for you all day.

5
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,168
They got worried.
Thought you were trying

6
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,628
to avoid them
or something.

7
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,379
What is it?
What've you got?

8
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,758
Oh, great.

9
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,135
That's $2,000, man.
$2,000!

10
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,262
Mr. Jennings gave it
to me to give to you.

11
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:19,555
He says he's sorry
it's so late,

12
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,681
but it's
the first scholarship

13
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,433
the Moose Lodge has given out.
(CHUCKLES)

14
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,936
And he says they're all very
proud of you back at the Lodge.

15
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,313
Cute. Why don't you hold
it for me for a while?

16
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,814
Hey, I don't want it.
Take it. It's yours.

17
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,566
I'll take it.

STEVE: Listen,
if your sister calls...

19
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,738
I'll talk to you later, okay?
CURT: Wait a second. Wait a second.

20
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:36,947
She can wait.

21
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,491
Make it short and sweet,
though, huh?

22
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,742
Listen,

23
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,912
I don't think I'm gonna
be going tomorrow.

24
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,123
Come on, what are you
talking about?

25
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,417
Well, I was thinking I could
wait a year, you know.

26
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,212
Go to City for a while.

27
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,798
You chicken fink.
Wait a minute.

28
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,717
After all we went through
to get accepted?

29
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,344
We're finally getting
out of this turkey town,

30
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,806
and now you want to crawl
back into your cell, right?

31
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:06,310
You want to end up
like John?

32
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,145
You just can't
stay 17 forever.

33
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,855
CURT: It's just...
You've got to get that through your head!

34
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,316
I just need some time.

35
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:15,319
I've got to go talk to Laurie.
Now take it. Take it!

36
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,947
Now, we're leaving in
the morning, all right?

Hi, John.
JOHN: Not too good, huh?

45
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,343
Why is it every girl
that comes around here

46
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,637
is ugly,
or has a boyfriend?

47
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,306
Where is
the dazzling beauty

48
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,725
I've been searching for
all my life?

49
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,643
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

50
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,438
The pickings are
really getting slim.

51
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,690
The whole strip
is shrinking.

52
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,736
I remember about
five years ago,

53
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,321
take you
a couple of hours and

54
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,741
a tank full of gas
just to make one circuit.

55
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,368

If he can't find me, then he
ain't even worth racing, right?

63

Big shot.

Where was I?

67
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,689
How you thought high
school romances were goofy

68
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:16,941
and we started
going together

69
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,984
just because you thought I
was kind of cute and funny,

70
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,111
but then you suddenly realized
you were in love with me,

71
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,447
it was serious, and...

72
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,995
Oh. You were leading up
to something kind of big.

73
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,040
You make it sound like
I'm giving dictation.

(LAUGHS)

75
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,836
Well, seriously,

76
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:42,007
what I meant was that since we
do care for each other so much,

77
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:46,554
and since we should really
consider ourselves as adults now,

78
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,598
I...

79
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,769
Could I have a couple
of those fries?

LAURIE: "Consider ourselves adults.
" Right. Right.

83
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,779
I thought maybe,
before I leave,

84
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,949
we could agree

85
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,453
that seeing other
people while I'm away

86
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,164
can't possibly hurt,
you know?

87
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,339
You mean
dating other people?

88
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:25,009
I think it would strengthen
our relationship.

89
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,304
Then we'd know for sure
that we're really in love.

90
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,639
Not that
there's any doubt.

91
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,317
I think you're right.

92
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,028
I mean,
we're not kids anymore,

93
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:47,281
and it's silly to think that
when we're 3,000 miles apart,

94
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,783
we shouldn't be able to see
other people and go out.

95
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,286
Laurie, listen, I didn't
ask for that back.

96
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,164
I know. I just sort of
think it's juvenile now.

97
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,541
I'll keep it at home.
It's less conspicuous there.

98
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,585
You don't want to wear it?
I didn't say that.

99
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,921
I understand,
and I'm not upset.

100
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,298
I mean,
I can't expect you

101
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,800
to be a monk or something
while you're away.

102
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,929
And I got a really neat
record collection.

103
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,681
I even got Pledging My
Love by Johnny Ace.

104
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:13,974
Look, how can
you love Nelson

105
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,434
when he's going out
with Marilyn Gator?

106
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,769
Since he dumped
on you, I was...

107
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,938
He didn't dump on me,
you little dip!

108
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,606
Oh, hi, Steve.
Hey.

109
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,233
Hey, Sis.

110
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,449
What's wrong?
Nothing.

111
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,494
What is it?
Nothing!

112
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,665
And I've decided
that I'm gonna let you

113
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,625
take care of my car
for me while I'm away.

114
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,126
At least until Christmas.

115
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,796
See, I'm coming back for a
couple of weeks at Christmas.

116
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,799
Now, I've got some very
simple instructions for you.

117
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,133
Here's the keys.

118
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:51,220
First of all,
only 30-weight Castrol R.

119
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,389
Now, I've written the
tire pressure and stuff

120
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,974
on a pad
in the glove...

121
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,141
Are you listening?

122
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,393
Hey, what's wrong?

123
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,728
Are you crying?

124
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,147
I can't believe it.

125
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,483
I don't know
what to say.

126
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,904
I'll love and protect this
car until death do us part.

127
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,156
This is
a super fine machine.

128
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,284
This might even be better than
Darryl Starbird's Superfleck Moon...

129
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:18,247
It is! It's better than Darryl
Starbird's Superfleck Moonbird.

130
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:19,748
Budda?

131
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,916
Yeah?

132
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,836
How would you like to go to
the drive-in movies with me?

133
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,171
(LAUGHING) You've got
to be kidding.

134
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,132
No! Would I kid you
about a thing like that?

135
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,050
I have a new car. Hey!

136
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,885
(ALL LAUGHING)

137
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,599
Hey, hey,
did she do that to you?

138
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,059
Hey, Curt,
you want to bomb around?

139
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,353
I want to try out
my new wheels.

140
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,604
Well, I'd like to, Toad,

141
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,773
but I'm gonna go with Steve
and Laurie to the hop.

142
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,192
And besides, I'd spoil
your luck, anyway.

143
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,944
Yeah. Right.

144
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,612
Tonight, things are
gonna be different.

145
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,072
Hey, hey, wait a
minute, wait a minute.

146
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,658
You're going to the hop?
The freshman hop?

147
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,076
CURT: Yeah.
Oh, come on, man.

148
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:59,705
That place is for kids.
You two just got your ass out of there.

149
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,040
Don't go back there.

150
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,207
CURT: You ain't got
no emotions?

151
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,918
We are going to remember
all of the good times,

152
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,336
is what we're gonna do.

153
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:07,671
Yeah, well, go.

154
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,423
Why won't you
come with us?

155
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,716
Bullshit, man!

156
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,051
Come on.
For old times' sake.

157
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,635
Yeah, yeah.
Well, listen. You go.

158
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,388
Go ahead, Curtsy baby.
You go on over there and you remember

159
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,390
all the good times
you won't be having.

160
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,893
I ain't going off to some
goddamned fancy college!

161
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,104
I'm staying right here!
Having fun, as usual.

162
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:30,069
Jesus, Milner! You're really in a
great mood tonight, you know that?

163
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,653
What's the matter,
John?

164
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,035
Did I do something wrong?
I'm sorry.

165
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,704
Ah, man, it's nothing.

166
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,541
Well, then we'll
see you later, okay?

167
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:45,751
Right.

168
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:46,960
We'll all do
something together,

169
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,545
you know,
before Steve leaves.

170
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,838
Yeah.

171
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,675
Oh, wait a minute.
Now you're not going?

172
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,761
I don't know.

00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,670
Cut around him.

693
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,006
Just hang a right
at the corner.

694
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,634
(HORN HONKING)
Oh, lost her again.

695
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,218
Who is she?

696
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:33,180
I don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.

697
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,767
I know who she is.

698
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,606
Well, come on, Bob.

699
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,734
Come on, who is she?

700
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,528
Come on!

701
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,366
You know Mr. Beeman?
He owns Hepcat Jewelers.

702
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:53,909
Yeah.

703
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,703
That's his wife.
(CHUCKLES)

704
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,830
Get out of here.

705
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:02,125
That's ridiculous.
That girl is young and beautiful.

706
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,251
And married.

707
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:05,212
And she was
cruising 10th Street.

708
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,965
You got to be thinking
of someone else.

709
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,091
Hey, did you know

710
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,427
that my ex is going to
become a presidential aide?

711
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:17,557
Yeah, and it's a secret,
so don't tell anybody.

712
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:22,062
But his greatest ambition is to
shake hands with President Kennedy.

713
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,566
How do you suppose you're gonna
do that, wishy-washy, at JC?

714
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:30,153
Well, maybe I've grown up.
Maybe I changed my mind.

715
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:31,238
I doubt it.
I doubt it.

716
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,990
Maybe you don't
think you can do it.

717
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,324
Maybe you ought
to shut up.

718
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,118
Maybe I ought to.
But I won't.

719
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:39,246
Maybe you ought to come
into the aft chamber.

720
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,249
Where we can
discuss this in private.

721
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,380
Thanks a lot.

722
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,757
Come on, Wendy.

723
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,308
Move over.
I'm not sitting on your lap.

724
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:04,646
To the opera, James.

725
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:06,481
Drop dead.

726
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,859
Unless you want to go to Gallo
Dam and have a little orgy.

727
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,068
You wish.

728
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,737
Oh, I could pick up
some oleomargarine,

729
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,031
roll around in it for a while.
(LAUGHING)

730
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:30,630
GIRL: Hey, you guys, keep
your mind on the road.

731
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,309
I've been silly.

732
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:43,894
Oh, yeah?

733
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,354
I'm really glad
you're gonna stay.

734
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,736
We might even have
a class together.

735
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:54,863
Maybe.
BOBBIE: Look.

736
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:56,239
Maybe.
BOBBIE: Look.

737
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:57,616
There's Kip Pullman.

738
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,201
He's so neat.

739
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:02,204
Look. Say something
to him when we go by.

740
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:03,914
What do you
want me to say?

741
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,457
Anything.
I just want to meet him.

742
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,543
CURT: Hey, Kip, buddy.
What's up?

743
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:11,630
Hey, Henderson. Long time no see.
What you been doing?

744
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:13,965
Nothing, nothing.

745
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:17,094
I just wanted to tell you
that Bobbie here's

746
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:19,805
madly in love with you
and trembles at the sight

747
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:21,348
of your rippling biceps.

748
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:28,105
Out of my car, you...

749
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:30,190
Wait a second.
Wait a second.

750
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,485
I hate you!
Get out of my car!

751
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,489
Temper, temper!

752
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:39,741

Yes, found Barbara Ann.

754
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:16,820
Hey, this one is for all you out
there watching the Submarine Races.

755
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,794
Here it is.
One 10-cent Coke with ice.

756
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:37,299
And don't take all day drinking it.
Please.

757
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:40,886
Oh, rats. I thought some of
my friends might be here.

758
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:43,597
Probably a couple of weeks
past their bedtime now.

759
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,391
Oh, wait. There's Dee Dee.
I hope she sees me.

760
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,435
Shit. Dee Dee.

761
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,813
Hiya, John.
Oh.

762
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,482
JOHN: What do you say, Al?
Not much.

763
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,736
Say, do you think if I brought
my Mopar by the shop on Monday,

764
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,112
you could spot weld
the bumper bracket?

765
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:00,363
Sure. Anything.

766
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:01,698
Just come by before noon.
All right?

767
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,783
Sure. Hey, you met Linda? Fine.

768
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:06,036
No, no. Hi, Linda.

769
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,247
This is my cousin, Carol.

770
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,499
Carol, Linda. Al.

771
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:14,419
I'm babysitting tonight.

772
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:15,670
Babysitting?

773
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:17,047
JOHN: Yeah, Jesus!
Watch it, will you?

774
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:21,343
Been hitting me all night.
Kids will be kids, you know.

775
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:25,222
Hold on, God damn it.
Why don't you grow up, for Christ's sake?

776
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:27,349
We don't
get along too well.

777
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,643
You know how it is.
It's been like this...

778
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:32,145

Hi.

00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:55,979
Excuse me, sir.

786

Yes, son?

787
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:02,110
I was wondering, could
you give me the time?

788
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,238
Oh, sure.
It's 11:45.

Thanks a lot.

Okay.

791
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:15,206
Oh, excuse me, sir.

792
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,669
I got a problem. See, I lost my I.
D. in a flood

793
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:22,797
and I was wondering, since
you're going in there anyway,

794
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:25,467
could you pick me some Old Harper?
Hard stuff?

795
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:26,843
Would you
buy me a bottle?

796
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,219
Why, certainly.

797
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,889
I lost my wife, too.

798
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:34,851
Her name wasn't Idy, though,
and it wasn't in a flood.

799
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:36,186
But I know what you...

800
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,270
Yeah, good.

801
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,898
Here's... Here's some money.
Old Harper.

802
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:41,900
Great.

out the back.

Let me have...

Okay, yeah.
Let me have a 3 Musketeers

815
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,922
and a ball-point pen,

816
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,175
one of those combs there,
a pint of Old Harper,

817

a couple of
flashlight batteries

818
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,554
and some beef jerky.

00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,280
Okay. You got an I. D.
for the liquor?

00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:11,698
Oh.

00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:13,491
Yeah.

Oh, nuts.
I left it in the car.

823
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,580
Sorry. You'll have
to get it before...

Well, I...

825
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,709
I also...
I forgot the car.

826
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:34,471
Hey, did you get it?
You get it, you get it, you get it?

827
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:36,556
You got it.
You got it.

828
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,727
You didn't get it.
Why didn't you get it?

829
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,145
Well, I...
I needed some things

830
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,856
and I thought, as long
as I was in there...

831
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,650
Look, Debbie,
can you loan me a dollar?

832
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:52,864
Are you for real? Come on.
Girls don't pay. Guys pay.

833
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:56,784
Yeah. Well, see, I've only got
$50 and he doesn't have change.

834
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:01,247
Wow. I can't
believe this.

835
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,583
I really
cannot believe this.

Here.

837
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,801
Hi, excuse me.
I'm wondering, could you...

838
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:15,595
Buy you a bottle
of booze?

839
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:19,057
Yeah, I know. You lost your I.
D. What kind do you want?

840
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:22,894
Gee, that's terrific.
Just some Old Harper.

841
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:28,399
Great.

collision with a drunk.

845
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:12,569
Boom!

846
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:16,197
Didn't have a chance.
He was a good driver, too.

847
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,242
It's pretty grim
when a guy gets it,

848
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,994
and it's not
even his own fault.

849
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:23,705
Needs a paint job,
that's for sure.

850
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,456
See that over there?
That '41?

851
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:26,749
That used to be,
believe it or not,

00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:28,501
the fastest car
in the valley.

853
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,170
I never got a chance
to race Earl, though.

854
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:36,092
He got his in 1955 in about the
hairiest crash we ever had here.

have seen it.

was real impressed,

858
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:44,976
see, so they come up,
film the whole thing.

859
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,854
Now they show it in
drivers' education classes.

860
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,106
You'll probably see it
if you get lucky.

861

they take somebody with them.

You told me.

863

01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,640
for all the valleys
and the mountain tops.

1033
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:54,770
Gonna be hot. About 200 degrees in
Merced, 400 degrees out in Fresno,

1034
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:57,064
and I know we're gonna
have about 500 degrees

1035
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:58,857
up around the valley
there somewhere.

1036
01:02:58,942 --> 01:03:01,402
You got
The Wolfman Jack Show.

1037
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:20,379
Hey, now, this is terrific.
See, I love miniature golf.

1038
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:22,089
Is that right?

1039
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,091
I hate it.

1040
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:28,012
Well, I don't play it too often anyway.
What are we doing here?

1041
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:29,722
We're out of gas, man.

1042
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:33,017
CURT: They don't...
They don't sell gas here.

1043
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,228
I know.
But we're out of money, too.

1044
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:51,160
(PANTING) Ha!

1045
01:03:57,584 --> 01:04:00,044
Hey! Hey. What are
you punks doing?

1046
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:01,211
What's going on here?

1047
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:03,547
Why, just...

1048
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:07,468
Hey, hi, Mr. Gordon.
What's up?

1049
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:10,179
Henderson?

1050
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:13,724
Curt Henderson, are
you with these punks?

1051
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:15,893
These are just
some friends of mine.

1052
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:16,977
Oh, yeah?

1053
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:18,687
Yeah. We're just,
you know...

1054
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:20,105
(LAUGHING) Oh.

1055
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:23,609
Well, you had me nervous
there for a second, huh?

1056
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:25,652
Yeah? (LAUGHING)
Yeah. Yeah.

1057
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:28,489
Well, you didn't
leave yet, huh?

1058
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:32,951
Oh, no, I'm not...

1059
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:37,164
I'm not scheduled to leave
until tomorrow morning.

1060
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:38,707
Tomorrow? Oh.

1061
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:41,919
Hey, Hank Anderson's inside.
Come on in and say goodbye. Huh?

1062
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:43,712
You know, he brought your
name up at the Moose Hall.

1063
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:44,797
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1064
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:45,923
You got the check, didn't you?
Uh-huh.

1065
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:55,182
Hey, Hank,
look who's here.

1066
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:57,518
Well, well.
Well, well, well.

1067
01:04:58,103 --> 01:05:02,022
Well, well, how are you, Curt?
What a pleasant surprise.

1068
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:06,402
Congratulations, my boy.
We're all proud of you. All of us.

1069
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:11,156
You know, the Moose Scholarship
went to the right boy. You.

1070
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:12,574
And we're all
proud of you.

1071
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:13,700
Hey.

1072
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:16,703
We're all done out here.

1073
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:18,789
All done?
What's he mean?

1074
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:23,085
He means we're all done
having loads of fun out here.

1075
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:24,461
Oh, well...
Wonderful.

1076
01:05:24,546 --> 01:05:25,921
Yes. You can have all
the fun you want.

1077
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:27,089
This place is for fun.

1078
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:28,298
Yes, it is.

1079
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:30,426
Thank you.
Thank you both.

1080
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:31,635
Good luck now.

1081
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:34,096
Curt,
before I say goodbye,

1082
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:36,974
I hope you'll be
taking along with you

1083
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:39,184
a little piece
of this place.

1084
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,103
I think I have.

1085
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:43,230
Good.
Don't forget us.

1086
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:45,983
No, I won't forget you
and you won't forget me.

1087
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:47,151
Okay. Bye-bye.
Okay.

1088
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:48,527
Goodbye and good luck. Bye now.

1089
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:49,736
Bye.
Bye.

1090
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:51,238
It was nice
to meet you.

1091
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:53,449
Right. What he said
goes for me, too.

1092
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:02,458
Yeah, you just might make
it as a Pharaoh yet, boy.

1093
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:05,627
Someday he'll
make a fine Moose.

1094
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:09,590
DEBBIE:
What's the matter?

1095
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:12,926
TERRY: The radio's gone.

1096
01:06:13,011 --> 01:06:14,219
Yeah?

1097
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,723
That means the car is gone!
Come on.

1098
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:35,199
Oh, God!
Not the car!

1099
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:39,745
Oh, no! Anything!
Not the car!

(ROMANTIC SONG PLAYING
ON RADIO)

1101
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:05,521
You know,
it doesn't make sense

1102
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:07,523
to leave home
to look for home.

1103
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:11,443
To give up a life
to find a new life.

1104
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:16,073
To say goodbye to friends you
love just to find new friends.

1105
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:18,158
Wait a minute.
Could you say that again?

1106
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:19,785
Something Curt said.

1107
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:22,454
Mmm. Figures.

1108
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,999
You must've talked his ear off
trying to get him to stay.

1109
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:29,753
Oh, no, Steven. That's not true at all.
I didn't say anything.

1110
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:32,673
Curt just said
at dinner tonight

1111
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:35,092
that he didn't see
what the big hurry was.

1112
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:39,096
He thought that he ought to stick
around and go to JC for a while,

1113
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:42,266
and try and figure out what he
wanted to do with his life.

1114
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:44,893
That sounds logical.

1115
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:46,937
Do you think so?
Sure.

1116
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:49,690
I think Curt's probably
right, for Curt.

1117
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:52,317
Not for me though.

1118
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,822
Laurie, look at me.

1119
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:05,080
Now, you know what
I want out of life,

1120
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:06,665
and it's just not
in this town.

1121
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:14,715
I'm not going with you
to the airport tomorrow.

1122
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:25,434
No, Steven, don't.

1123
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:26,602
Come on.

1124
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:28,103
No.

1125
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:29,688
It's our last night
together for three months.

1126
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,690
I know. But we've been
through this before.

1127
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,650
I'm gonna
miss you so much.

1128
01:08:33,735 --> 01:08:34,943
I need something
to remember you by.

1129
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:37,529
You don't want me to
forget you, do you?

1130
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:39,031
No.

1131
01:08:52,587 --> 01:08:54,671
Well, what's wrong?
You're just sitting there.

1132
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:55,964
Well, you want to.
Go ahead.

1133
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:57,215
Not like that.

1134
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,092
If you're not gonna remember
me for anything else,

1135
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:00,510
why don't you
just go ahead?

1136
01:09:00,595 --> 01:09:03,096
Oh, come on, you want
it and you know it.

1137
01:09:03,181 --> 01:09:05,140
Don't be so damn
self-righteous with me,

1138
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:08,143
after all that stuff you told
me about watching your brother.

1139
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:11,229
You're disgusting.
Get out of my car. Get out!

1140
01:09:11,606 --> 01:09:14,191
Laurie.
I told you never to mention that.

1141
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:21,990
So, anyhows,
the Goat Killer...

1142
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:23,116
Can't we talk
about something else?

1143
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:24,701
No.
Whenever he strikes,

1144
01:09:24,786 --> 01:09:27,245
he leaves a bloody goat's
head next to the victim.

1145
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:28,914
Isn't that creepy?

1146
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:32,292
They thought he went up to
Stockton, but two nights ago

1147
01:09:32,377 --> 01:09:36,296
they found the bodies of
Carlie Johnson and Don White

1148
01:09:36,381 --> 01:09:39,299
right here at this canal,
all hacked to pieces.

1149
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:42,219
Who do you think will take
the regionals this year?

1150
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:45,138
Not only were there bloody
goats' heads all around,

1151
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:47,808
but he had, like, switched
parts of their bodies.

1152
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:52,354
She had on his arms and
he had on her legs and...

01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:00,237
Do you think it's

in this field.

the Goat Killer,

1163
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:19,589
he'll get somebody and
we'll see the whole thing.

1164
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:21,299
I don't want to
see the whole thing!

he's doing though.

I wish I could see.

1168
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:29,975

I don't wanna see anything.

Just keep him away from me.
That's all I want.

into these things?

01:32:34,466 --> 01:32:36,050
What happened, man?

1533
01:32:47,103 --> 01:32:49,480
Hi, Steve.
Hi, Judy. Hi, Karen.

1534
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:51,273
Where's Laurie?

1535
01:32:53,777 --> 01:32:55,569
Well, we know
where she is.

1536
01:32:56,738 --> 01:32:57,780
So what?

1537
01:32:57,864 --> 01:32:58,864
So nothing.

1538
01:32:59,324 --> 01:33:03,285
Just that she was with a really
cute guy in a really boss car,

1539
01:33:03,703 --> 01:33:06,663
and we thought you just
might know who it was.

1540
01:33:08,249 --> 01:33:09,917
I'm sorry,
but I wouldn't know.

1541
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:11,085
We know.

1542
01:33:11,377 --> 01:33:13,295
His name's Bob Falfa.

1543
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:23,388
MAN ON INTERCOM: Yes?
Help. No...

1544
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:26,100
Bring two Cherry Cokes
with lots of ice.

1545
01:33:26,184 --> 01:33:28,685
No, never mind. Forget...
Just bring the ice. Pronto.

1546
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:30,771
Out. Out.
Get out of the car. Hey!

1547
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:31,897
Steve,
what are you doing?

1548
01:33:31,981 --> 01:33:33,607
Get out.
Just get out and shut up.

1549
01:33:33,691 --> 01:33:34,775
You, too.
Get out. Get out!

1550
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:35,943
TERRY: What's going on?

1551
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:38,529
I don't know, but I'm
about to find out.

1552
01:33:46,746 --> 01:33:48,330
I can't believe it.

1553
01:33:48,414 --> 01:33:50,457
You practically get killed
trying to get your car back

1554
01:33:50,542 --> 01:33:52,501
and then you
let him have it.

1555
01:33:53,503 --> 01:33:55,045
It's not my car.

1556
01:33:55,505 --> 01:33:56,588
What?

1557
01:33:57,799 --> 01:33:59,383
It is not my car.

1558
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:03,303
Well, then,
where is your car?

1559
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:06,682
I don't have a car.

1560
01:34:07,016 --> 01:34:09,017
Well, what about
your Jeep?

1561
01:34:10,395 --> 01:34:12,479
Well, how am I
gonna get home?

1562
01:34:18,444 --> 01:34:21,446
Where's your car?
I have to hang them on a car.

1563
01:34:22,907 --> 01:34:24,324
I need a ride.

1564
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:29,955
Hey, Toad, what
happened to you, man?

1565
01:34:30,039 --> 01:34:31,540
Did you lose
your car again?

1566
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:33,500
No, Steve took it.

1567
01:34:36,129 --> 01:34:37,838
I want to go to sleep.

1568
01:34:37,922 --> 01:34:40,591
WOLFMAN ON RADIO: You got to take it
easy when you drive that car of yours.

1569
01:34:40,675 --> 01:34:43,510
You've got to
cruise easy, baby.

1570
01:34:43,595 --> 01:34:47,347
Don't be doing any accidents
or anything on me now.

1571
01:34:47,599 --> 01:34:51,101
You know, Terry?
I had a pretty good time tonight.

1572
01:34:51,769 --> 01:34:53,312
Oh, come on.
You're just...

1573
01:34:53,396 --> 01:34:54,855
No, no.
Really, really.

1574
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:56,857
I really
had a good time.

1575
01:34:57,066 --> 01:35:00,277
I mean, you picked me up
and we got some hard stuff,

1576
01:35:00,445 --> 01:35:03,864
and saw a holdup, and then
we went to the canal.

1577
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:05,782
You got
your car stolen.

1578
01:35:06,201 --> 01:35:08,952
And then, I got to
watch you getting sick.

1579
01:35:09,287 --> 01:35:12,372
And then, you got in this
really bitching fight.

1580
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:14,583
I really
had a good time.

1581
01:35:16,336 --> 01:35:19,838
Yeah, well, I guess I have a pretty
good time just about every night.

1582
01:35:19,923 --> 01:35:22,341
Well, if I'm not
doing anything tomorrow,

1583
01:35:22,425 --> 01:35:24,593
why don't you
give me a call, okay?

1584
01:35:25,470 --> 01:35:26,970
Yeah, all right.

1585
01:35:27,305 --> 01:35:28,680
I got a little Vespa
that I just kind of

1586
01:35:28,765 --> 01:35:30,265
play around with.
Maybe, you know, we...

1587
01:35:30,350 --> 01:35:35,729
Really? Well, that's almost a motorcycle,
and I just love motorcycles.

1588
01:35:35,813 --> 01:35:37,981
You do? Why didn't you
say something earlier?

1589
01:35:38,066 --> 01:35:40,984
We wouldn't have had to
go through all the fun.

1590
01:35:42,403 --> 01:35:43,862
I gotta go.

1591
01:35:44,572 --> 01:35:45,656
Ow.

1592
01:35:48,201 --> 01:35:50,285
Good night.
See you.

1593
01:36:54,434 --> 01:36:56,310
Hey, what do you want?

1594
01:36:56,894 --> 01:36:59,438
Push the red switch down.

1595
01:37:04,068 --> 01:37:05,610
I'm looking
for this girl.

1596
01:37:05,903 --> 01:37:10,157
Yeah. Aren't we all?
She's not here.

1597
01:37:11,075 --> 01:37:12,868
Come on in the back.

1598
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:15,370
You just go
around the back.

1599
01:37:15,455 --> 01:37:17,289
Thank you.
This way.

1600
01:37:26,007 --> 01:37:27,090
Hey.

1601
01:37:28,801 --> 01:37:30,927
Have a popsicle.
The icebox just broke down

1602
01:37:31,012 --> 01:37:32,012
and they're melting
all over the place.

1603
01:37:32,096 --> 01:37:33,847
You want one?
No, no. No thanks.

1604
01:37:33,931 --> 01:37:35,307
Listen...

1605
01:37:35,391 --> 01:37:36,641
Have a popsicle.

1606
01:37:37,185 --> 01:37:38,935
Are you the Wolfman?

1607
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:40,479
(CHUCKLING)

1608
01:37:40,563 --> 01:37:42,272
No, man.
I'm not the Wolfman.

1609
01:37:45,693 --> 01:37:47,194
Wait a minute.

1610
01:37:55,787 --> 01:37:58,205
WOLFMAN ON TAPE: Who is this
on the Wolfman's telephone?

1611
01:37:58,331 --> 01:37:59,956
GIRL ON TAPE: Diane.
How're you doing, Diane?

1612
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:01,375
That's the Wolfman.

1613
01:38:01,459 --> 01:38:02,459
Do you love me?

1614
01:38:02,543 --> 01:38:04,002
He's on tape.

1615
01:38:04,087 --> 01:38:06,797
(LAUGHS) The man
is on tape. Well...

1616

(SIGHS)

1617
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:11,635
Where is he now?
I mean, where does he work?

1618
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:14,805
The Wolfman
is everywhere.

1619
01:38:17,642 --> 01:38:19,810
Well, I gotta give
him this note. Shit!

1620
01:38:20,603 --> 01:38:22,687
GIRL: Can I wizz on you, Wolfman?
(SOFT ROMANTIC SONG PLAYING)

1621
01:38:23,606 --> 01:38:25,649
Here, let me
see the note.

1622
01:38:30,655 --> 01:38:32,155
Hell, that's just
a dedication, man.

1623
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:33,615
What I can do
is I relay it.

1624
01:38:33,699 --> 01:38:35,659
It'll be on
tomorrow or Tuesday.

1625
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:37,911
No, no. See,
this is very important.

1626
01:38:37,995 --> 01:38:40,080
You see, I may be
leaving town tomorrow

1627
01:38:40,164 --> 01:38:41,957
and it's very
important that I...

1628
01:38:42,834 --> 01:38:45,001
Damn it. That I reach
this girl right now.

1629
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:48,338
You don't know whether you're
gonna leave town or not?

1630
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:52,259
Well, I'm supposed to go to
college back east tomorrow,

1631
01:38:52,343 --> 01:38:55,637
and I don't know if I'm gonna go.
I don't know.

1632
01:38:56,514 --> 01:39:00,016
Wait a minute.
Have a popsicle. Have a...

1633
01:39:00,184 --> 01:39:01,226
Huh?
No. No, thanks.

1634
01:39:01,310 --> 01:39:02,310
Sit down a minute.

1635
01:39:02,687 --> 01:39:04,354
(SIGHS) It's early
in the morning.

1636
01:39:04,439 --> 01:39:05,522
Damn.

1637
01:39:07,275 --> 01:39:08,859
I can't talk
for the Wolfman,

1638
01:39:08,943 --> 01:39:10,986
but I can tell you
one thing.

1639
01:39:13,072 --> 01:39:16,283
If the Wolfman was here, he'd
say, "Get your ass in gear."

1640
01:39:16,451 --> 01:39:17,784
(LAUGHS)

1641
01:39:17,869 --> 01:39:20,036
The Wolfman comes
in here occasionally

1642
01:39:20,121 --> 01:39:23,165
bringing tapes, you know, to
check up on me and whatnot.

1643
01:39:23,624 --> 01:39:25,041
And the places
he talks about

1644
01:39:25,126 --> 01:39:28,170
that he's been,
the things he's seen.

1645
01:39:28,588 --> 01:39:31,381
It's a great, big,
beautiful world out there.

1646
01:39:32,091 --> 01:39:36,803
And here I sit,
sucking on popsicles.

1647
01:39:38,055 --> 01:39:39,389
Why don't you leave?

1648
01:39:39,724 --> 01:39:41,850
I'm not
a young man anymore.

1649
01:39:42,435 --> 01:39:44,603
And the Wolfman
gave me my start

1650
01:39:44,687 --> 01:39:46,396
in the business,
and I like it.

1651
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:49,441
I tell you what.

1652
01:39:49,775 --> 01:39:52,027
If I can possibly
do it tonight,

1653
01:39:52,403 --> 01:39:55,322
I'll try to relay
this dedication in

1654
01:39:55,823 --> 01:39:57,574
and get it on the air
for you later on.

1655
01:39:57,742 --> 01:40:01,536
That would be terrific.
Really. Thanks.

1656
01:40:01,704 --> 01:40:03,079

01:40:05,041 --> 01:40:06,833
Hey, it's been
a pleasure, really.

1658
01:40:06,918 --> 01:40:08,835
Thanks a lot.
I appreciate it.
