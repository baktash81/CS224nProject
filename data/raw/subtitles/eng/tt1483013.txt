1
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,963
<i>Earth, before the war.</i>

2
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,729
<i>New York, before I was born.</i>

3
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,845
<i>A place I've only
seen pictures of.</i>

4
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,600
<i>I know you...</i>

5
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,723
<i>But we've never met.</i>

6
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,764
<i>I'm with you...</i>

7
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,326
<i>But I don't know your name.</i>

8
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,768
<i>I know I'm dreaming. But it
feels like more than that.</i>

9
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,761
<i>It feels like a memory.</i>

10
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,088
<i>How can that be?</i>

11
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,168
<i>March 14th, 2077.</i>

12
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,409
<i>Five years since
the mandatory memory wipe.</i>

13
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,530
<i>And I'm still haunted
by these dreams.</i>

14
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,960
<i>Victoria and I were
assigned together.</i>

15
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,484
<i>In two weeks, our mission here will be
finished, and we'll I join the others.</i>

16
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,170
<i>But the questions I ask,
she doesn't.</i>

17
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,324
<i>The things I wonder about,
she won't.</i>

18
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,366
<i>It's been half a century since the
scavengers destroyed our moon.</i>

19
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,003
<i>Forced to leave their own dying
planet, they came to take ours.</i>

20
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,323
<i>Without the moon, the Earth
was thrown into chaos.</i>

21
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,841
<i>Earthquakes toppled
cities within hours.</i>

22
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,330
<i>Tsunamis wiped
out what remained.</i>

23
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,528
<i>Then came the invasion.</i>

24
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,681
<i>We did what we had to do.</i>

25
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,282
<i>We used the nukes.</i>

26
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,447
<i>We won the war,
but lost the planet.</i>

27
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,645
<i>Left it contaminated.
Most of it uninhabitable.</i>

28
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,641
<i>What remained of humanity
had to leave the Earth.</i>

29
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,841
<i>We built the Tet,
our mission control.</i>

30
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,362
<i>A temporary space station
before the migration to Titan,</i>

31
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,562
<i>Saturn's largest moon.</i>

32
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,290
<i>Everyone's there now.</i>

33
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,929
<i>Well, almost everyone.</i>

34
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,645
<i>Until our tour is complete,
Vika and I do our job.</i>

35
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,404
<i>We protect the hydro rigs,</i>

36
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,483
<i>which convert Earth's sea water</i>

37
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,568
<i>into fusion energy
for the new colony.</i>

38
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,166
<i>The survival of humanity
depends on it.</i>

39
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,720
Thank you for the coffee.

40
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,970
<i>Remnants of the scavenger army
continue to disrupt the operation.</i>

41
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,527
<i>They attack our drones
at night,</i>

42
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,927
<i>and try to kill me
during the day.</i>

43
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,244
<i>There's still fight in them,
but I don't know why.</i>

44
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,160
<i>Mission says we have done well.</i>

45
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,002
<i>That we are an effective team.</i>

46
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,207
<i>Vika's my
communications officer.</i>

47
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,362
<i>She keeps an eye on me.</i>

48
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,208
<i>I handle drone maintenance.</i>

49
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,286
<i>The drones watch everything.</i>

50
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,126
<i>Vika can't wait to go.
Me, I'm not so sure.</i>

51
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,122
<i>I can't shake
the feeling that Earth,</i>

52
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,402
<i>in spite of all
that's happened...</i>

53
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,166
<i>Earth is still my home.</i>

54
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,842
Jack Harper, Tech-49.

55
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,001
Morning, Bob.

56
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,845
<i>Tower, comm check.</i>

57
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,850
<i>Drone Maintenance Technician
49, hydro rig support.</i>

58
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,930
All Bubbleship systems
are green.

59
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,127
I'm good to go.

60
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,567
Copy, Tech-49, you're cleared.
Be careful out there.

61
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,688
- Always am.
- No, you're not.

62
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,841
Yeah, you're right.
I gotta work on that.

63
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,402
All right, Tet's coming
online in 30 seconds.

64
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,723
Relaying hydro rig coordinates now.
Confirm visual.

65
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,682
I got 'em. Hydro rigs
are sucking seawater.

66
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,247
You got 'em, Bob?

67
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,883
Drone 185 looks good.

68
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,684
Jack,
we've got two drones down.

69
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,241
Shit.

70
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,004
Stand by,
Mission coming online.

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,082
<i>And we have Tet contact.</i>

72
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,091
Morning, boss.

73
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,442
<i>Tower 49,
this is Mission Control.</i>

74
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,682
<i>How y'all doing
this lovely morning?</i>

75
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,004
Another day in paradise, Sally.
Uploading data now.

76
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,722
49 mission log.
Day 1642, hydro rig support.

77
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,769
- I have two...
<i>- You have two drones offline.</i>

78
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,763
<i>Perimeter's compromised.</i>

79
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,730
Copy that, relaying to Tech.
Stand by.

80
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,606
Jack, 166 is down in Grid 37.

81
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,566
Linking to beacon now.

82
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,962
<i>You'll go there first.</i>

83
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,771
Got it. On my way.

84
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,321
<i>Mission, Tech-49 is
en route to Grid 37 now.</i>

85
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,528
<i>Can you plug that hole
with Drone 109?</i>

86
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,127
Negative, 109 is in the dock.
Still waiting for parts.

87
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,602
<i>Jack better find those drones
and get 'em flying.</i>

88
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,967
<i>Those rigs can't be
exposed overnight.</i>

89
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,121
Copy that.

90
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,090
<i>Tower,
didn't he fix 166 recently?</i>

91
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,049
Jack has fixed all
the drones recently.

92
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,884
And, if we had the parts
that we've been asking for,

93
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,530
we wouldn't be running
a skeleton crew down here.

94
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,331
<i>Understood.
We're doing the best we can.</i>

95
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,681
<i>Are you an effective team?</i>

96
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,729
We are an effective team.

97
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,283
<i>Your directive today
is to rehabilitate 166</i>

98
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,204
<i>and find 172.</i>

99
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,521
<i>Get 'em flying by sundown,</i>

100
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,570
<i>and I'll buy you two a round of
drinks when you get up to the Tet.</i>

101
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,079
You had better be ready, Sally.

102
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,605
Two weeks now,
we're keeping track.

103
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,681
Okay.

104
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,807
Come on, Bob. Work
with me, here, buddy.

105
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,930
Tech-49?

106
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,570
<i>Tech-49?</i>

107
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,041
<i>Jack?</i>

108
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,561
Copy, Tower.

109
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,563
What happened?
I lost you for a second.

110
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,121
Really?

111
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,244
<i>Coming up on location.</i>

112
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,001
There it is.

113
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,722
I've got multiple scav kills.

114
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,082
Drone 166 put up
a hell of a fight.

115
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,321
Got any movement?

116
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,007
No sign of scavenger activity.

117
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,403
But I've got limited visibility, here,
Jack, due to low angle of Mission.

118
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,251
Copy that. I'm coming in hot.

119
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,324
Starting repairs.
Watch my back.

120
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,689
I always do.

121
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,327
You know,
I read about this game.

122
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,043
It was played right here.

123
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,490
The last Super Bowl.

124
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,130
Please don't tell me
it was a classic.

125
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,766
A classic game.

126
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,161
Down by four.

127
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,851
<i>The ball</i>

128
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,488
<i>was on the 50-yard line.</i>

129
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,170
<i>Seconds left on the clock.</i>

130
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,970
The ball is snapped,

131
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,211
and the QB fumbles.

132
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,730
Disaster.

133
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,643
Looks like the game is over.

134
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,204
I'm reading the whole
central core off-alignment.

135
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,362
You don't have the necessary
tools down there.

136
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,280
<i>And a new fuel cell is
not going to fix that.</i>

137
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,364
But this QB runs back,
and picks up his own fumble.

138
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,720
Hold on, what did you just do?

139
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,411
<i>There's a wall of linebackers
closing in on him.</i>

140
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,201
<i>So, he throws a long ball with
no idea who is at the other end.</i>

141
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,044
A Hail Mary.

142
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,128
Eighty-thousand people
on their feet,

143
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,402
watching this ball
sail through the air.

144
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,403
Downfield is a rookie wide
receiver, third string.

145
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,041
He just leaps out of the pack.

146
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,609
Touchdown!

147
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,801
Contact! West contact!

148
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,529
<i>Jack?</i>

149
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,246
It's okay, Vika.

150
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,084
It's just a dog.

151
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,361
Hey.

152
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,883
Now, go on. You gotta
get out of here.

153
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,281
Go on, get!

154
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,568
Get out of here! Go!

155
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,769
<i>Tech-49, Jack Harper.</i>

156
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,799
You're welcome.

157
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,769
166 is back online.

158
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,565
Two drones shot down today. Ten fuel
cells stolen in just over a month.

159
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,001
These scavs are getting bolder.

160
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,361
<i>Well, the hydro rigs
are taking all the water.</i>

161
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,411
Once we're gone, they'll have
nothing but dust and radiation.

162
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,844
<i>This is bullshit.</i>

163
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,844
We won the war.

164
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,525
Now we have to leave.

165
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,529
Two more weeks, Jack.

166
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,527
<i>Then we'll be on
our way to Titan.</i>

167
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,841
Yep.

168
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,487
That drone is out
there somewhere.

169
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,044
We just have to find it.

170
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,523
Without a beacon, that's like
finding a needle in a haystack.

171
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,210
So we go to our ground game.

172
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,651
Tower, I've located 172

173
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,562
down a sinkhole.

174
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,802
No visual, but I can hear it.

175
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,082
Tet's so far off angle,
I can barely see you.

176
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,446
How's it look?

177
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,401
It's good, it's good. There's no
sign of scav activity on top.

178
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,608
<i>Tet's offline in 15 minutes.</i>

179
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,480
<i>After that, you're on your own.</i>

180
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,002
<i>Mission, this is Tower 49.</i>

181
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,364
<i>Jack has located drone 172.
Engaged in recovery now.</i>

182
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,922
Requesting backup
to his location ASAP.

183
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,007
I've got a visual on Drone 172.

184
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,046
Jack?

185
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,764
What the hell?

186
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,371
Shit.

187
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,201
Jack!

188
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,282
Tech-49, Jack Harper.

189
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,607
Jack Harper, Tech-49!

190
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,161
Hey!

191
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,522
Oh, no.

192
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,961
Come on. Not my goddamn bike!

193
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,128
"How can a man die
better Than facing fearful odds"

194
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,363
"For the ashes of his fathers
And the temples of his Gods"

195
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,721
Jack?

196
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,526
Yep, I'll be right there.

197
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,722
<i>How does 109 look?</i>

198
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,959
Can it fly?

199
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,724
Barely.

200
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,441
And without armor,
she's a sitting duck.

201
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,604
Well, I'll talk to Sally about
that shielding in the morning.

202
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,879
Okay.

203
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,959
Again.

204
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,202
What, Jack Harper?

205
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,649
Where did you get this?

206
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,205
It was growing in...

207
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,719
Come on, Jack,
you know the regulations.

208
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,960
I know you think I'm a stickler

209
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,439
but you have no idea
what kind of toxins

210
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,488
could be in something
like that.

211
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,279
It's a flower, Vika.

212
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,486
Yeah, that's not the point.

213
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,680
It's that we are
so close to the end,

214
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,565
and the last thing that we need
is you putting it all at risk.

215
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,090
Okay.

216
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,768
Every day,
you have to go down there

217
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,565
and see what was lost.

218
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,205
But we've done our job, Jack.

219
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,882
It's time to go.

220
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,089
I don't think they were
trying to kill me today.

221
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,204
The scavs.

222
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,169
They were trying to catch me.

223
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,451
Well, they can't have you.

224
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,051
Come on.

225
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,123
You should come with me
sometime, before we leave.

226
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,241
There's a place I found
I'd like to show you.

227
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,361
I'll show you something.

228
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,924
Hey, hey!

229
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,001
Oh, my God.

230
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,726
<i>It was</i> a <i>six-stage meltdown
from inside the hydro rig's core.</i>

231
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,530
<i>It's offline permanently.</i>

232
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,445
<i>Tower 49, you have put
the whole operation at risk.</i>

233
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,682
<i>I need to know
exactly what happened.</i>

234
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,571
<i>Jack believes the scavs
weaponized one of the stolen fuel cells</i>

235
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,768
<i>and got it into the suction.</i>

236
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,365
<i>Tower, hold.</i>

237
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,089
Tower, I've got a rogue signal in Grid 37.
Are you seeing this?

238
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,571
Yes.

239
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,364
<i>It's gotta be scav.</i>

240
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,564
It's not one of ours.

241
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,731
Jack, the signal is
being directed off-planet.

242
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,765
On my way.

243
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,089
<i>Tower, our logs show you are missing
an additional nine fuel cells.</i>

244
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,319
<i>Can you confirm?</i>

245
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,482
Negative, Mission,
that number is 10.

246
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,042
Drone 172 was lost last night.

247
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,087
109 is combat-ready as soon
as we get that shielding.

248
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,323
We can cover the remaining
rigs with drones in the field.

249
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,441
I've run the numbers.

250
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,443
<i>We'll do the numbers up here,
Tower.</i>

251
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,046
<i>I'm tasking the drones
to defensive positions.</i>

252
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,759
Copy.

253
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:56,199
<i>Our job is to run those rigs. Your
directive is to protect them.</i>

254
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,039
<i>We cannot afford to lose another.
Do you copy?</i>

255
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,041
Copy.

256
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,288
<i>Are you and Jack
an effective team?</i>

257
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,566
Damn right we are.

258
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,489
Jack?

259
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,120
You're right on top of it.
Do you have a visual?

260
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,559
<i>Jack?</i>

261
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,722
Yeah, I got it.

262
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,922
They have some kind
of a repeater.

263
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,529
The scavs are using
the building as an antenna.

264
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,681
Can you decrypt?

265
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,044
It's a set of coordinates.

266
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,284
<i>Grid 17.</i>

267
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,409
<i>It's a goddamn homing beacon.</i>

268
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,766
Grid 17.

269
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,361
What the hell is out there?

270
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,207
Nothing.
It's the middle of nowhere.

271
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,123
<i>What is going on?</i>

272
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,410
Why would the scavs send
a signal off-planet, Jack?

273
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,645
I'm shutting it down.

274
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,490
Tech-49, check your course. You're
headed right for the border.

275
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,128
<i>That radiation will cook you from
the inside before you know it.</i>

276
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,288
It's okay, Vika. I see it.

277
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,725
I'm gonna do a perimeter check
before I head home.

278
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,248
I may go off-comm.

279
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,679
Jack,
we should keep in contact.

280
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,920
Just let me know where you are.

281
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,090
<i>Do you copy?</i>

282
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,124
<i>Jack, do you copy?</i>

283
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,002
That's right, Bob.

284
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,524
You know where we're going.

285
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,406
Are you gonna miss me?

286
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,808
I'm gonna miss this place.

287
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,327
It would have been great.

288
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,962
It would have been great.

289
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,688
<i>Vika? Vika, did you get that?</i>

290
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,370
<i>Jack, where have you been?</i>

291
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,488
An object came down in 17.

292
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,039
That's the beacon coordinates.

293
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,159
Exactly.

294
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,003
<i>I saw it. Some sort of vessel.</i>

295
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,571
Jack, Mission's almost offline.

296
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,370
<i>I'm en route now.</i>

297
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,721
Mission, we have an unidentified
object impact in 17.

298
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,042
It came down at coordinates
sent by a scav beacon.

299
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,201
My tech's en route now.

300
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,562
<i>Tower,
we're going offline soon,</i>

301
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,842
<i>but drones are already
mobile and executing.</i>

302
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,729
<i>Have your tech stand down.</i>

303
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,325
Copy.

304
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,848
Jack, Mission wants you to stand down.
The drones will handle it.

305
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,650
<i>That's a negative, Tower.</i>

306
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,087
With Tet offline,
we need our eyes on this.

307
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,083
I want to know
this site is secure.

308
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,559
Sally, my tech's concerned about
the security of the site.

309
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,881
<i>Tower, you have lost
enough assets for today.</i>

310
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,008
<i>Keep your tech out of there.
Do you copy?</i>

311
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,400
Copy, Command, I'm...

312
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,923
Jack, Command wants you to stand down.
The drones will handle this.

313
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,684
<i>I'm on site.</i>

314
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,081
<i>Jack.</i>

315
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,925
<i>I don't have eyes on you.
Command's offline.</i>

316
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,050
Vika, I think it's one of ours.

317
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,284
This thing is ancient.
It looks...

318
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,280
pre-war.

319
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,761
The scavs brought
this thing down, Jack.

320
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,251
There's no sign of scavs.

321
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,765
<i>Technician,
this is your Control.</i>

322
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,083
I'm ordering you to pull out and
return to the tower immediately.

323
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,443
Touching down.

324
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,764
They're human.

325
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,763
Tower, we have got survivors.

326
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,925
There are four...
Check it, five survivors.

327
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,011
They are human.

328
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,960
Stand down!

329
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,088
Vika, the drones are
firing on survivors.

330
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,767
Jack, the Tet's offline.
I don't have control.

331
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,046
Stand down!

332
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,649
<i>Jack Harper, Tech-49.</i>

333
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,882
<i>Back off, you son of a bitch!</i>

334
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,844
<i>Back off!</i>

335
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,328
Open the door.

336
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,205
Vika!

337
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,246
Get the med kit.

338
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,362
Get the med kit!

339
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,047
This has to be reported.

340
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,599
Be sure and report
that the drones

341
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,240
killed the crew from
one of our own ships.

342
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,051
See what Command makes of that.

343
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,167
It's breathing fluid.
Just let her get it out.

344
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,521
Jack.

345
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,606
Here. You're still dehydrated.

346
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,682
Where are we?

347
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,446
I'm Victoria, this is Jack.

348
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,008
What's your name?

349
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,725
I'm Julia.

350
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,606
Julia...

351
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,082
I'm sorry for what
I have to tell you,

352
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,289
but you were in a crash.

353
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,204
Your ship came down.

354
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,641
Jack managed to pull you
from the wreckage.

355
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,969
But none of your crew survived.

356
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,286
What do you mean?

357
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,848
You're the only one
that made it.

358
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,570
I'm sorry.

359
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,283
You've been in delta sleep
for a long time.

360
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,646
Some disorientation is normal.

361
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,131
How long?

362
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,170
Sixty years.

363
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,004
At least.

364
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,406
I have to get back to our ship.

365
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:58,563
It's too dangerous down there.
You need to rest.

366
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,201
Vika...

367
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,370
Don't touch me.

368
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:23,047
Your ship's re-entry was triggered
by a beacon from the surface.

369
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,531
Do you know
anything about that?

370
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,881
What was your mission?

371
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,285
It's classified.

372
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,886
Well, we have
no record of an <i>Odyssey...</i>

373
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,319
I can't tell you anything

374
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,080
until I get the flight
recorder from my ship.

375
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:49,245
Julia, a lot has
changed in 60 years.

376
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,089
While you were in delta sleep,

377
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,445
Earth was attacked.

378
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,962
Call them scavs.

379
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,609
They destroyed our moon and
with that, half the planet.

380
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,402
Then they invaded.

381
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,090
We won the war,

382
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,689
but Earth was ruined.

383
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,007
Everyone's on Titan now.
It's a moon of Saturn.

384
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:25,449
Or on the space station,
getting ready to go.

385
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,445
We're here for security
and drone maintenance.

386
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,531
We're the mop-up crew.

387
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,328
You've lost people.

388
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,961
Everything.

389
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,720
If you want to be alone,
we understand.

390
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,487
The drones killed
her entire crew.

391
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,641
If I hadn't gotten there...

392
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,365
I want her gone first thing.

393
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,931
Vika...

394
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,882
Do you have any memories
before the mission?

395
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,687
Before the security wipe?

396
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,886
Our job is not to remember.

397
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,891
Remember?

398
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,210
Do you remember her?

399
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,401
Jack...

400
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:59,365
That was a scav beacon
that brought her down.

401
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,285
We don't know who she is.

402
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,451
Or what she is.

403
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,727
Let's just get
through the night.

404
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,724
Okay?

405
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,570
You fly that thing?

406
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,725
Yes.

407
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,289
What happens now?

408
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,768
The Tet will be online soon.

409
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,242
Victoria will
report your rescue.

410
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,327
They'll send
someone down for you.

411
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,284
From the Tet?

412
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,286
Yes.

413
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,566
I need to get the flight
recorder from my ship.

414
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,440
The scavs, they move at night.

415
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,599
They could be
all over it by now.

416
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,523
I need to know what happened.

417
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,929
You need to know what happened.

418
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,643
Please.

419
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,130
Jack?

420
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,328
Jack, what are you doing?

421
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,766
Vika, she's a flight officer.

422
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,203
She wants to see her ship and
secure the flight recorder.

423
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,850
Now, you would
want the same thing.

424
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,684
<i>Jack, I...</i>

425
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,486
I can't protect you.

426
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,843
No, I understand.

427
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,642
This one's on me.

428
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,930
I couldn't save them.

429
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,449
Jack. Jack!

430
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,565
Jack, can you hear me?

431
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,570
All right, it's time to go.

432
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,131
Jack.

433
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,485
I found it.

434
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,799
Jack!

435
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,205
<i>Tower 49, how are y'all
this lovely morning?</i>

436
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,962
Another day in paradise.

437
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,401
Sally...

438
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:45,208
Jack took a pre-dawn patrol

439
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:49,001
and went off-comm

440
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,170
near the canyons in 17.

441
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,530
Now,
I know we're low on drones,

442
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:03,323
but, requesting one
to sweep the area.

443
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,409
Just a quick scout.

444
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,647
<i>Copy 49,
tasking 185 to Grid 22.</i>

445
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,923
"And how can a man die
better Than facing fearful odds"

446
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,564
"For the ashes of his fathers"

447
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,610
"And the temples of his Gods"

448
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,440
I've been watching you, Jack.

449
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,481
You're curious.

450
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,847
What are you looking
for in those books?

451
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:26,125
Do they bring
back old memories?

452
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,641
You won't get anything from me.

453
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,484
My memory has been
wiped to protect...

454
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,564
the security of
the mission. Yes.

455
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,119
You can't have
your precious memory

456
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,441
falling into the wrong
hands, now, can you?

457
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,245
Tell me.

458
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,769
Have you ever met
a scav up close?

459
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:52,485
Of course not.
You just repair drones.

460
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,248
"Don't go into
the radiation zone."

461
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:59,483
"Don't ask too many questions."

462
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:04,368
Not part of
the job description.

463
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,247
Lights.

464
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,203
We're not alien, Jack.

465
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,291
We're human.

466
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,488
Of course, for us,
being human is a problem.

467
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,846
Old stealth fighter tech.
Shields us from your scanners.

468
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,843
Vocal scrambling.

469
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,080
Can you hear me, Jack?

470
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:54,690
Keeps your drones confused.

471
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,561
Well, most of the time.

472
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,239
The drones are programmed...

473
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,844
To kill humans, Jack.

474
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:05,050
You saw what they did
to those sleep pods.

475
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:09,405
You almost got yourself blown
to bits protecting that woman.

476
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,690
Why did you do that?

477
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,610
Anyone would have.

478
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:19,966
"Anyone."

479
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,641
Interesting.

480
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,290
We're wasting our time.

481
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,763
The drone will track him here.

482
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,080
That's Sergeant Sykes.

483
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,407
He thinks I'm a fool for
having brought you here.

484
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,368
I hope you prove him wrong.

485
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,119
Mission,
I'm picking up a bio trail

486
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,439
somewhere near
the west canyons.

487
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,930
Can you confirm the sequence?

488
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,411
<i>Stand by.</i>

489
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,527
<i>DNA confirmed. It's Jack.</i>

490
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,169
<i>Vika, are you okay?</i>

491
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,886
<i>Everything good
between you two?</i>

492
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,485
Of course.

493
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,961
<i>You're still an effective team?</i>

494
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,089
We're great.

495
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,880
Never better.

496
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,401
<i>We were running
a ground game, and losing.</i>

497
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,801
So, we decided,
"What the hell?"

498
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,287
"We've got to
throw the long ball."

499
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,842
It took us decades just
to crack the GPS codes.

500
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,651
That's how you brought
down the Odyssey.

501
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,410
Why?

502
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,041
The <i>Odyssey's</i> compact
reactor, courtesy of NASA.

503
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,771
Very hard to come by.

504
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,323
Did you like
the show last night?

505
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:53,088
That was just one fuel cell.

506
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,204
Imagine what 10
of them will do,

507
00:57:56,360 --> 00:58:00,524
with a core of
weapons-grade plutonium.

508
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:05,083
We have a nuke, and we
have a drone to carry it.

509
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:09,211
But we can't access it.
It doesn't know who we are.

510
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,840
But it knows you, Jack.

511
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,126
We need you to
program the drone.

512
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,884
Have it carry our
nuke up to the Tet.

513
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,130
End this war.

514
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,804
There are people up there.

515
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,121
Sergeant.

516
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,887
Program the drone
to return to the Tet.

517
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:51,008
It needs to go
right to the center.

518
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,084
Screw you.

519
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:57,921
We haven't got time for this.

520
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:24,766
Hey. Hey!

521
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:37,801
No.

522
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:45,961
- Let's go!
- Get him up.

523
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,840
Mission,
185 just went off-grid.

524
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,968
<i>Copy, Tower,
we're seeing the same thing.</i>

525
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:49,686
Permission to task
two additional drones?

526
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:54,046
If one drone is here,
more will come.

527
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,406
And they won't stop
until they find me.

528
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,881
They'll turn
this place to dust.

529
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:03,171
But if you let us go,
I'll call them off.

530
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,850
It's your only chance.

531
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,842
I've been to your

532
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,402
"radiation zones."

533
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,244
If you're looking
for the truth,

534
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,927
that's where you'll find it.

535
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:53,048
You've risked all our lives.
Everything.

536
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,285
What makes you
think he's different?

537
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,046
She does.

538
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:59,001
<i>Mission, I've found
my tech over in 37.</i>

539
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,650
<i>You can call off the search.</i>

540
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:03,326
<i>Copy that, Tower.
Glad Jack's safe.</i>

541
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,609
<i>Tasking the other drones
back to rig support.</i>

542
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,367
Where are we going now?

543
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:35,964
Who are you?

544
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,401
What aren't you telling me?

545
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,685
Jack, I...

546
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:45,530
What were you
doing on the <i>Odyssey?</i>

547
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,403
What was your mission?

548
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:55,246
It was a research flight
to Titan. My first.

549
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,890
That's what it was
supposed to be.

550
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:05,722
Six weeks to launch, deep space
scanners picked up an alien object.

551
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,406
We were reassigned
to investigate.

552
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,486
They put us all in delta.

553
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:14,565
They must have woken
you and Victoria first.

554
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:20,286
What?

555
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,408
That object

556
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:24,562
was the Tet, Jack.

557
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:28,483
The Tet was our mission.

558
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:33,962
That's impossible.

559
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,445
That's impossible!

560
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:39,003
Who are you?

561
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,083
I'm your wife.

562
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:53,284
I don't know what happened, but
you're not who you think you are.

563
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:04,327
Jack, we were here.

564
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:09,684
You asked me to meet you, brought
me up on top of the world.

565
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:18,130
I could tell
you were nervous that day.

566
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:20,967
It was right here, Jack.

567
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,644
You said,

568
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,962
"Look through here,

569
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,720
and I'll show you the future."

570
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,844
And I held up a ring.

571
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:58,841
And you said...

572
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,570
"Yes."

573
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,882
There you are.

574
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:14,168
There you are.

575
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,401
Hi.

576
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,449
Hello.

577
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:45,805
Come on.

578
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,527
<i>Vika, I'm coming in.</i>

579
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:55,930
<i>Do not report to Mission until I get back.
Do you copy?</i>

580
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,245
<i>Do you copy?</i>

581
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,681
Vika, open the door.

582
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:20,002
Stay away from me.

583
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:23,009
I don't want to hear it.

584
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:26,842
It's not safe here,
and we need to leave, now.

585
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,443
It was always her.

586
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,691
Wasn't it?

587
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:39,211
Vika...

588
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:46,489
She's my wife.

589
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,686
Mission, this is Tower 49.

590
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,205
<i>Go ahead, 49.</i>

591
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:07,725
No.

592
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:10,328
I'm having a problem
with my technician.

593
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,244
No, you don't know
what you're doing.

594
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,050
He found a survivor
at the crash site.

595
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:15,239
You've gotta listen to me.

596
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:17,402
She's impeding his abilities,

597
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,328
and he is unfit for service.

598
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:21,811
No, no, no.

599
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:24,691
<i>I'm sorry to hear that, Vika.</i>

600
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:27,208
<i>Are you still
an effective team?</i>

601
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,286
Vika...

602
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,169
Open the goddamn door, Vika!

603
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:33,044
No.

604
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,239
We are not an effective team.

605
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:04,090
Vika, please.
We have to go now.

606
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:06,561
I'm not going anywhere
with you, Jack.

607
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:10,242
There's a place I know.
We'll be safe.

608
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,565
I'm going to Titan.

609
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,201
There is no Titan.

610
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,325
They lied to us.

611
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,807
Just stay away from me.

612
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:25,249
Vika, please,
there are things...

613
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:26,447
Things you need to know.

614
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,443
I don't want to know!

615
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:33,921
Jack...

616
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:17,361
<i>Hi, Jack. I don't believe
we've had the pleasure.</i>

617
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,371
What have you done?

618
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:24,286
<i>You can't blame yourself for this.
Drones are unreliable.</i>

619
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,363
<i>Sometimes things go wrong.</i>

620
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,089
"Go wrong"?

621
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,251
You killed her.

622
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:38,281
<i>I know, it's tragic.
She was a wonderful person.</i>

623
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,643
<i>Jack, we want to bring you in.</i>

624
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,481
<i>I've been
authorized to tell you</i>

625
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,807
<i>we're going to
assign you a new mission.</i>

626
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,849
<i>You and the survivor.</i>

627
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:58,649
<i>There's</i> a <i>lot of interest up here.
Bring her up.</i>

628
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:02,282
<i>We can debrief,
then anything's possible.</i>

629
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,525
<i>It's time to come home, Jack.</i>

630
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,004
<i>Jack?</i>

631
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:09,885
<i>Jack?</i>

632
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,081
Jack...

633
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,205
I'm sorry.

634
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,245
Hang on.

635
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:02,201
Lightning.

636
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:03,761
That's the plan.

637
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,520
We need cover.

638
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,646
There.

639
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:31,483
- Are you okay?
- No.

640
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:43,924
Don't worry,
we're staying out of there.

641
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,441
Are we gonna die?

642
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:55,601
No!

643
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,365
Maybe.

644
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:02,601
Jack!

645
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:44,688
Son of a bitch.

646
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:53,761
Wait here.

647
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:34,445
Who is it?

648
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,005
Hey!

649
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,011
Wait!

650
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,170
Wait!

651
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:20,970
Hey!

652
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:40,726
Drop your weapon!

653
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,004
It's okay.

654
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:02,806
Don't move!

655
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:09,290
We have to shut
that drone down.

656
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:12,441
Stop moving!

657
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:13,687
Jack!

658
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:22,089
It's okay.

659
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,405
Julia.

660
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,370
Julia!

661
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:58,761
Don't.

662
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:01,401
Don't touch me.

663
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:20,206
Hold on.

664
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:22,330
Just hold on.

665
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:56,643
Jack Harper, Tech-52.

666
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,644
Hey.

667
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:09,529
There you are.

668
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,045
What happened? Are you okay?

669
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:18,603
That bogey came across the
border and then I lost you.

670
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:22,481
False alarm.

671
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:28,485
I should get back out there.

672
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:32,169
You come all the way home,
and I don't get a kiss?

673
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:45,082
What's going on up there?

674
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:48,408
I was thinking...

675
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,403
Why don't you
come down with me?

676
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:54,560
To the surface?

677
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:56,649
We could go right now.

678
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,565
Now?

679
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:00,487
Yeah.

680
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,010
Are you serious?

681
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:05,686
You won't believe
what's down there.

682
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:11,929
Jack...

683
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:14,729
You know the regulations.

684
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:17,085
Yes.

685
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:22,770
Can we not do this again?
I'm done talking about it.

686
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:26,365
Okay.

687
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:16,889
This is gonna hurt.

688
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:30,327
Hell of a day, Bob?

689
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,843
You always loved this song.

690
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:03,450
I'm not him.

691
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:08,284
I know I'm not.

692
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,568
But I've loved you...

693
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:18,522
for as long as I can remember.

694
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:22,406
I don't know
how else to say it.

695
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:30,406
You know what
you said to me once?

696
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:36,090
You said when it was all over, you
would build me a house on a lake.

697
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:42,806
We would grow old
and fat together.

698
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:45,884
And we would fight.

699
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:49,447
Maybe drink too much.

700
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,561
Real romantic.

701
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:59,364
And then we would die

702
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:03,046
and be buried in
a meadow by the lake.

703
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:08,485
And the world would
forget about us.

704
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:15,085
But we would
always have each other.

705
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,610
I remember.

706
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:24,051
Those memories are yours, Jack.

707
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,045
They're ours.

708
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:30,281
They are you.

709
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:33,771
Good morning.

710
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:42,361
I wanted to spend
the rest of my life here.

711
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:45,526
You still can.

712
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,443
I have to go.

713
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:54,366
Those people need my help.

714
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,282
We'll come back when it's over.

715
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:06,446
Promise me.

716
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:10,682
We'll come back when it's over.

717
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:49,887
You had me worried
for a second.

718
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:53,322
I thought you
weren't coming back.

719
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:58,043
Well, I had to prove him wrong.

720
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:02,560
You look like shit.

721
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:07,044
You should see the other guy.

722
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:08,964
If I had told you what
you'd find out there,

723
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:11,009
you would have
thought I was crazy.

724
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:14,003
I still do.

725
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:16,887
Malcolm Beech.

726
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:18,406
Julia Harper.

727
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:28,006
Come on.

728
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:35,559
<i>Mission,
I'm picking up a bio-trail</i>

729
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:36,879
<i>somewhere near
the West Canyons.</i>

730
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:38,723
<i>Can you confirm the sequence?</i>

731
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,370
<i>Stand by.</i>

732
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,761
<i>DNA confirmed, it's Jack.</i>

733
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:47,883
<i>Mission,
185 just went off-grid.</i>

734
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:50,327
<i>Copy, Tower.
We're seeing the same thing.</i>

735
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:04,725
I'd been in the army less than a
year when that unholy Tet arrived.

736
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:08,208
I saw the moon get taken out.

737
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:10,647
Right up there
in the night sky.

738
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:13,761
I couldn't believe it.

739
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:18,205
After that, nature took over.

740
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:20,850
There's bedrock around Chicago,

741
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:25,289
so we were spared the worst
of the waves and the quakes.

742
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:28,969
Most people just starved.

743
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:33,684
Then the Tet sent
troop ships down.

744
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,809
The doors opened,

745
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:39,088
and out you came.

746
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:42,960
Astronaut Jack Harper.

747
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:46,607
Thousands of you.

748
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,291
Memory wiped.

749
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:53,765
Programmed to kill.

750
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:58,206
They had taken one of our best

751
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:01,002
and turned him against us.

752
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:05,925
No soul.

753
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:09,850
No humanity.

754
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:15,165
The Tet.

755
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:18,727
What a brilliant machine.

756
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:23,406
Feeding off one planet
after another for energy.

757
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:28,204
Phase Two was drones.

758
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,323
Repairmen.

759
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:36,643
50 years of watching those hydro
rigs suck our planet dry.

760
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:40,924
Then one day,

761
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:45,122
I saw you set down.

762
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:48,169
Another drone to fix.

763
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:53,162
But in the rubble
that day was a book.

764
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:56,968
You picked it up.

765
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,407
You studied it.

766
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:04,526
And I thought I saw a way.

767
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:09,889
When you stepped in front of
that drone and saved her,

768
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:12,206
I knew.

769
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:16,205
You were in there somewhere.

770
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,682
I just had to find
a way to bring you back.

771
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:46,130
Watch it, watch it.

772
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:48,163
Eyes on it. Steady.

773
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,322
Give it some space.

774
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:52,729
Come on, you're
making it nervous.

775
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:58,606
That is one pissed-off weapon.

776
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:02,563
No, it's just a machine.

777
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:07,962
<i>I'm the weapon.</i>

778
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:24,882
I would love to be there to see

779
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,207
that thing's face
when this goes off.

780
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:29,762
That would be a one-way trip.

781
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:33,402
Yeah, but it would be worth it.

782
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:53,962
Welcome back, Commander.

783
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:35,771
Open the doors!

784
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:03,286
Shit!

785
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:04,526
Spread out!

786
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,529
Head down, keep your head down!

787
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:45,921
Jack!

788
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:48,245
Follow me!

789
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:49,126
Come on, you son of a bitch!

790
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:51,641
Hey!

791
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:53,286
Jack.

792
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:01,489
I'm okay.

793
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:23,325
The drone.

794
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,649
Send the drone.

795
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:31,689
It's gone.

796
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:35,962
I thought we had it.

797
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:38,724
I really did.

798
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:42,687
I can take the bomb myself.

799
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:47,640
You know it will
swat you like a fly.

800
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:49,571
Not if I go.

801
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:53,800
No.

802
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:57,521
She asked you to bring me up.

803
01:41:59,160 --> 01:42:00,525
So bring me up.

804
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:06,371
We'll go together.

805
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:24,040
It reminds me of home.

806
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:35,690
Ready?

807
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,285
Jack.

808
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:21,369
Dream of us.

809
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:37,725
Jack...

810
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:29,328
<i>Flight recorder
playback for the Odyssey mission.</i>

811
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:31,960
<i>3 May, 2017.</i>

812
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:33,764
Okay, Bob.

813
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:36,449
Ready for space?

814
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:51,047
<i>Good morning, Odyssey, from
your friends here at Mission Control.</i>

815
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:53,280
<i>Good morning, Mission.
This is Commander Jack Harper.</i>

816
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:55,681
<i>Thank you for that
fantastic wake-up call.</i>

817
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:57,126
<i>Pre-rendezvous checks complete.</i>

818
01:44:57,280 --> 01:45:00,682
<i>Electrical guidance
and nav systems, all good.</i>

819
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:04,049
Range behind object,
250 clicks...

820
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:08,000
12 below V-bar, closure rate
200 kilometers per hour.

821
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:11,004
<i>Copy that.
It's good to see you, Jack.</i>

822
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:14,204
<i>After 39 days of sleep, sounds
like you're ready to go.</i>

823
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:16,564
I'm ready to go.

824
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,570
<i>Your next burn will
bring you up level</i>

825
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:21,883
<i>and co-speed at 50 kilometer
range, where you'll hold.</i>

826
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:24,682
Copy. We'll hold
50 clicks from object

827
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:27,007
for sensor scan and evaluation.

828
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:28,890
Targets look good.

829
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:32,362
Initiating burn in 3,2,1...

830
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:33,567
Ignition.

831
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:38,721
<i>We see a good burn.</i>

832
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:41,406
<i>Are you reading any
output from the object?</i>

833
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:42,601
Negative.

834
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:44,683
Zero heat. No EMR.

835
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:46,731
There's no sign of life.

836
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:48,769
<i>How is the rest
of the crew doing?</i>

837
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:51,241
Co-pilot Victoria Olsen
should be up here shortly.

838
01:45:51,400 --> 01:45:54,722
The rest of the crew
remains in delta sleep.

839
01:45:55,160 --> 01:45:56,279
<i>Copy that.</i>

840
01:45:56,280 --> 01:45:58,601
<i>You missed a hell
of a game last night.</i>

841
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:01,684
What did I tell you guys? No
spoilers about last night's game.

842
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:04,241
I'm looking forward to
watching it when I get back.

843
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:06,400
You're not talking about
football already, are you?

844
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:07,721
<i>Good morning, Vika.</i>

845
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:09,120
<i>Good morning, Sally.</i>

846
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:11,049
<i>How are you doing
this lovely morning?</i>

847
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:13,771
Another day in paradise.

848
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,401
Hey.

849
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:21,401
One for history.

850
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:22,521
Yeah.

851
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:38,969
<i>Tech-49,
I have you on approach.</i>

852
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:41,085
Hello, Sally.

853
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:44,602
It's a busy morning?

854
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:48,003
<i>I'm picking up
a second passenger, Jack.</i>

855
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:53,926
It's Julia Rusakova,

856
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:57,125
the female survivor
from the crashed module.

857
01:46:57,800 --> 01:46:59,962
<i>State your intention.</i>

858
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:04,287
Deliver the survivor,
as requested.

859
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:06,484
We are

860
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:10,801
a more effective team.

861
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:13,649
<i>Proceed to entry.</i>

862
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:21,486
<i>Mission, we have a situation.</i>

863
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:25,645
<i>The last burn was spot-on to give
us a 50-click hold from object,</i>

864
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:28,322
but radar range
still decreasing.

865
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:31,290
We're accelerating
toward the object.

866
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:33,010
We're going to need
full OMS burn to pull away.

867
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:34,810
- Initiate now.
- Entering target.

868
01:47:37,160 --> 01:47:38,571
- Gimbals set.
- Target's good.

869
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:40,683
- Arm forward engines.
- Engines on.

870
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:42,842
Ready? Let's go.

871
01:47:52,360 --> 01:47:55,364
Mission, we're in full OMS
burn, trying to back out.

872
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:57,159
There's a lot of vibration.

873
01:47:58,320 --> 01:47:59,919
We're not getting
away from this thing.

874
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:02,526
<i>Odyssey, telemetry shows
structural overstress.</i>

875
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:05,047
<i>Knock off the burn.
Do you copy?</i>

876
01:48:05,320 --> 01:48:06,367
Cutting off burn.

877
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:10,524
Mission.

878
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:12,645
- Mission?
- Mission?

879
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:14,046
Sally?

880
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:17,049
Increased acceleration
toward the object.

881
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:19,282
Estimated contact
within two minutes.

882
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:26,808
I'm going to eject
the sleep module.

883
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:29,488
It's programmed for
reinsertion into Earth orbit.

884
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:32,564
I'll fly the Command module
out if I break free.

885
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:34,529
- I want you back there now.
- Absolutely not.

886
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:35,761
That's an order!

887
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:37,041
Jack, no, we're a team.

888
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:02,405
We've got to go,
Jack! 30 seconds!

889
01:49:05,160 --> 01:49:07,731
Dream of us.

890
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:49,361
Jack...

891
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:08,888
<i>Tech-49,
enter at headway speed.</i>

892
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:12,287
Entering at headway.

893
01:50:28,440 --> 01:50:29,646
You buck up, Bob.

894
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,321
Don't go all shaky on me.

895
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:09,124
<i>Jack, I can't help notice</i>

896
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:13,001
<i>your respiration
and heart rate have increased.</i>

897
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:16,320
I'm just excited to
finally meet you, Sally.

898
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:21,526
<i>There's been a pattern of
insubordinate behavior recently.</i>

899
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:24,086
Yeah.

900
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:26,523
I feel bad about that.

901
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:31,520
<i>Voice analysis indicates
you are lying to me, Jack.</i>

902
01:51:31,680 --> 01:51:33,489
<i>Tell me why you are here.</i>

903
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:35,290
<i>You have five seconds.</i>

904
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:44,562
I want Julia to live.

905
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,685
I want our species to survive.

906
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:52,688
This is the only way.

907
01:51:58,360 --> 01:52:02,206
<i>Proceed to landing.
Atmosphere provided.</i>

908
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:03,523
<i>Welcome home, Jack.</i>

909
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:17,481
Come on.

910
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:20,524
<i>Jack,
you're doing the right thing.</i>

911
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:24,402
I don't know what you
are, or where you're from,

912
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:29,289
but I'd like to tell you
about something I read.

913
01:53:30,240 --> 01:53:33,369
A story from Rome,

914
01:53:34,360 --> 01:53:36,840
a city you destroyed.

915
01:53:37,680 --> 01:53:39,364
It's a classic.

916
01:53:40,240 --> 01:53:43,369
There was a guy, Horatius,

917
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:47,369
held the bridge alone
against a whole army.

918
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:50,000
And what Horatius said was,

919
01:53:50,160 --> 01:53:52,208
"How can a man die better..."

920
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:56,968
<i>You don't have to die, Jack.
She doesn't have to die.</i>

921
01:53:57,120 --> 01:53:59,521
Everybody dies, Sally.

922
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:01,364
The thing is, to die well.

923
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:14,883
<i>Jack, that's not
the survivor you promised me.</i>

924
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:17,642
No, it's not.

925
01:54:40,160 --> 01:54:43,881
What Horatius said was,

926
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:47,044
"How can a man die better"

927
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:52,567
<i>"Than facing fearful odds"</i>

928
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:56,328
Drones! Get inside! Get inside!

929
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:58,164
<i>"For the ashes of his fathers"</i>

930
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:03,771
<i>"And the temples of his Gods"</i>

931
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:07,448
<i>I created you, Jack.</i>

932
01:55:07,600 --> 01:55:09,682
<i>I am your God.</i>

933
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:23,764
Fuck you, Sally.

934
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:20,161
<i>Earth, after the war.</i>

935
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:24,282
<i>Three years have passed
since I saw your face.</i>

936
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:29,566
<i>I wonder if I come to
you at night, in dreams.</i>

937
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:33,967
<i>In the day, as memories.</i>

938
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:38,966
<i>Do I haunt your hours
the way you haunted mine?</i>

939
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:42,925
<i>And I wonder if you see me</i>

940
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:45,250
<i>when you look at her.</i>

941
01:56:57,400 --> 01:56:59,323
Mommy, look.

942
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:09,168
<i>If we have souls, they are
made of the love we share.</i>

943
01:57:12,640 --> 01:57:15,007
<i>Undimmed by time.</i>

944
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:18,401
<i>Unbound by death.</i>

945
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:39,641
<i>For three years, I searched
for the house he built.</i>

946
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:42,931
<i>I knew it had to be out there.</i>

947
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:49,161
<i>Because I know him.</i>

948
01:57:56,920 --> 01:57:58,922
<i>I am him.</i>

949
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:02,321
Who's that?

950
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:13,086
<i>I am Jack Harper.</i>

951
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:17,171
<i>And I am home.</i>
