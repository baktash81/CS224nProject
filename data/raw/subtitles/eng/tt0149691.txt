543
00:26:28,762 --> 00:26:31,424
Hmm. I don't know.

544
00:26:31,498 --> 00:26:33,523
One damn thing
led to another damn thing.

545
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,397
Ha ha!

546
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,459
I don't know.

547
00:26:37,537 --> 00:26:39,562
I don't know.
I became a history teacher.

548
00:26:41,107 --> 00:26:43,405
But one of these days, I'll...

549
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,408
One of these days--

550
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:46,445
Oh, my God.
Get away from my car!

551
00:26:47,714 --> 00:26:48,646
Oh, my God, look what he's doing!

552
00:26:48,715 --> 00:26:49,977
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!

553
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,711
No! Stop it!

554
00:26:51,785 --> 00:26:54,253
Oh, my God.
Look how deep this scratch--

555
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,720
Look what he did to my car.

556
00:26:55,789 --> 00:26:58,622
Mom, it's just a scratch.

557
00:26:58,692 --> 00:27:01,024
Just a scratch?

558
00:27:01,094 --> 00:27:02,391
Do you know how much
it's going to cost

559
00:27:02,462 --> 00:27:04,953
to fix ''just a scratch''?

560
00:27:05,031 --> 00:27:06,362
Oh, I can't work
at this school anymore.

561
00:27:06,433 --> 00:27:08,230
I can't talk to you anymore, either!

562
00:27:08,301 --> 00:27:09,233
No sympathy.

563
00:27:11,438 --> 00:27:14,373
The tiles are all cracked...

564
00:27:14,441 --> 00:27:15,874
and chipped.

565
00:27:15,942 --> 00:27:16,966
I'm sinking here,

566
00:27:17,043 --> 00:27:19,068
and I'm the one
that has to keep us afloat.

567
00:27:19,145 --> 00:27:21,739
Every time I think
I'm trying so hard,

568
00:27:21,815 --> 00:27:22,873
it's getting better,

569
00:27:22,949 --> 00:27:24,439
and we're starting to get somewhere,

570
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:27,111
just, everything falls apart.

571
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,052
Aah!Jesus!

572
00:27:29,122 --> 00:27:32,182
Nothing works in this apartment!

573
00:27:32,258 --> 00:27:33,520
- Mom?
- Aah!

574
00:27:33,593 --> 00:27:37,029
It's just a scratch on the car.

575
00:27:41,501 --> 00:27:43,162
Maybe if you got yourself

576
00:27:43,236 --> 00:27:45,966
a little after-school job,

577
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,633
you'd know what
I'm talking about.

578
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,869
People your age have no idea

579
00:27:50,944 --> 00:27:53,003
how much things cost,
how to manage money.

580
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:55,013
What is that now?

581
00:27:55,081 --> 00:27:57,481
You didn't pay the bill again,
did you?

582
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:01,953
I did pay the bill!
I did pay it!

583
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,419
Well, maybe I won't even
pay the bill again.

584
00:28:06,493 --> 00:28:08,222
Maybe we'll just...

585
00:28:08,294 --> 00:28:11,127
Ha!
We could live...

586
00:28:11,197 --> 00:28:12,596
in the dark

587
00:28:12,666 --> 00:28:14,531
like little...

588
00:28:14,601 --> 00:28:17,001
bears in a cave,
huh, pooh bear?

589
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,833
Hmm?

590
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:19,837
Just...

591
00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:28,213
Ok, let's go to Denny's.

592
00:28:31,551 --> 00:28:33,542
Ann?

593
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,781
Ann, where are you?

594
00:28:35,855 --> 00:28:37,789
I'm going to bed.

595
00:28:43,997 --> 00:28:45,931
[Door Slams]

596
00:28:47,467 --> 00:28:50,903
I really thought I paid that bill.

597
00:29:01,581 --> 00:29:05,017
I really think I did pay it.

598
00:29:11,257 --> 00:29:13,191
[Crying]

599
00:29:21,701 --> 00:29:24,329
So, I loveyou and
say hi to Benny for me

600
00:29:24,404 --> 00:29:26,634
and UncleJimmy
and Aunt Carol and...

601
00:29:26,706 --> 00:29:27,730
Ok, I loveyou.
Lots ofkisses.

602
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,035
[Kisses]
Bye.

603
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:30,337
Hi, Mom.

604
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,605
How are y'all doing?

605
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:34,408
What isn't fair?

606
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,039
Well, I put her on
because what's fair

607
00:29:36,116 --> 00:29:38,084
is for your grand daughter
to have a decent home

608
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,675
to live in,
and we can't do that

609
00:29:39,753 --> 00:29:42,244
unless we have some cash
for a down payment.

610
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,653
What I need from you

611
00:29:43,723 --> 00:29:45,315
is some help.

612
00:29:45,391 --> 00:29:46,483
Well...

613
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,027
sell my land, that's how.

614
00:29:49,095 --> 00:29:51,529
It's the land that Daddy--

615
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:55,892
She hung up.

616
00:29:55,969 --> 00:29:58,437
Grandma hung up on you?

617
00:30:03,143 --> 00:30:04,075
Yeah.

618
00:30:07,781 --> 00:30:09,715
[Hangs Up]

619
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,418
Let's get dressed up
and go out to dinner.

620
00:30:16,489 --> 00:30:18,047
What?

621
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:20,456
You love that
little French restaurant.

622
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,859
That's--
That'sjust what we need.

623
00:30:24,464 --> 00:30:26,056
We need a bed for me.
We need a desk.

624
00:30:26,132 --> 00:30:28,362
We need sheets.
We need towels.

625
00:30:28,434 --> 00:30:30,493
We don't need to go out to eat
to a French restaurant.

626
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,037
Oh, honey.

627
00:30:32,105 --> 00:30:34,335
My daddy always used to say,

628
00:30:34,407 --> 00:30:35,840
''When life gets rough

629
00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:37,740
and you only have a dime
in your pocket,

630
00:30:37,811 --> 00:30:40,644
go get your shoes shined.''

631
00:30:42,615 --> 00:30:44,139
Get dressed.

632
00:30:46,986 --> 00:30:48,044
Hmm.

633
00:30:50,123 --> 00:30:51,784
Seems they raised their prices.

634
00:30:51,858 --> 00:30:53,723
I'll tell you what.

635
00:30:53,793 --> 00:30:54,725
Why don't the two ofus--

636
00:30:54,794 --> 00:30:56,921
Good afternoon.
Would you like to hear our specials?

637
00:30:56,996 --> 00:30:58,987
I don't think so.
We know what we want.

638
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,157
I'd like to hear the specials.

639
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,165
Thank you.

640
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,792
Ok. We have the veal St.Jacques

641
00:31:02,869 --> 00:31:03,858
and a lovely coq au vin--

642
00:31:03,937 --> 00:31:06,269
I think we'll have
2 small garden salads

643
00:31:06,339 --> 00:31:07,271
and share the veal St.Jacques.

644
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,364
Don't you think, honey?

645
00:31:08,441 --> 00:31:09,965
You know what?
I don't really want to share.

646
00:31:10,043 --> 00:31:11,510
I'm kind of hungry, so...

647
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,909
Why don't you have
the veal St.Jacques,

648
00:31:12,979 --> 00:31:16,278
and I'll have
the duck l'orange, please.

649
00:31:16,349 --> 00:31:17,281
And would you like an appetizer?

650
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,282
- I don't think so.
- Yes.

651
00:31:18,351 --> 00:31:20,546
I'll have the shrimp

652
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,985
in the garlic sauce.

653
00:31:22,055 --> 00:31:23,317
Waitress:
And anything to drink?

654
00:31:23,389 --> 00:31:24,754
Just water.

655
00:31:24,824 --> 00:31:26,382
Bottled. A big bottle,

656
00:31:26,459 --> 00:31:27,517
please. Thanks.

657
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,361
Ok.
Thankyou.

658
00:31:36,336 --> 00:31:38,065
You know what?
I'm really hungry,

659
00:31:38,137 --> 00:31:40,401
and it's not like
we're at Denny's,

660
00:31:40,473 --> 00:31:42,100
so if someone comes in

661
00:31:42,175 --> 00:31:44,040
and sees me eating duck l'orange,

662
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,943
who knows what effect
it'll have on my life.

663
00:31:48,915 --> 00:31:50,849
Sit up straight.

664
00:31:50,917 --> 00:31:52,384
You're slouching.

665
00:31:55,388 --> 00:31:58,380
Ann: I took out an ad
in the newspaper once--

666
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,016
'' 1 5-year-old seeks home--

667
00:32:01,094 --> 00:32:04,029
Neat, pretty, good student.''

668
00:32:04,097 --> 00:32:05,359
I got 79 replies.

669
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,825
I never opened them.

670
00:32:09,903 --> 00:32:14,363
I was afraid the temptation
would be too great.

671
00:32:18,878 --> 00:32:20,539
Passion.

672
00:32:20,613 --> 00:32:22,774
Ann: It was our first Christmas
away from home.

673
00:32:22,849 --> 00:32:24,373
Doyou customize scents?

674
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:25,781
No? Oh, that's a shame.

675
00:32:25,852 --> 00:32:26,784
You should do that.

676
00:32:26,853 --> 00:32:28,150
My mother paid enough of our bills

677
00:32:28,221 --> 00:32:30,655
so that we could buy
presents for everyone.

678
00:32:30,723 --> 00:32:33,248
Ann: That's pretty cute.

679
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,987
Lavender.
What do you think?

680
00:32:35,061 --> 00:32:36,426
Uhh.

681
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,428
- Yeah?
- Mmm.

682
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:38,828
We didn't buy too much,

683
00:32:38,898 --> 00:32:39,956
considering I love that store.

684
00:32:40,033 --> 00:32:41,523
I don't know what to get Benny.

685
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:43,068
What did you get me?

686
00:32:43,136 --> 00:32:44,068
Come on, you got me something.

687
00:32:44,137 --> 00:32:45,069
I didn't get you anything.

688
00:32:45,138 --> 00:32:46,162
Oh, yes, you did.

689
00:32:46,239 --> 00:32:47,263
What'd you get me?

690
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,864
I got you lots.
I'm dying to show it to you.

691
00:32:48,942 --> 00:32:50,068
No. Don't show me.

692
00:32:50,243 --> 00:32:51,642
Ann, hi.

693
00:32:51,711 --> 00:32:53,736
Isn't it obscene,
all this money being spent?

694
00:32:53,813 --> 00:32:54,905
- Yeah.
- Hi.

695
00:32:54,981 --> 00:32:56,846
Hi, I'm Janice Pearlman.
I'm in Ann's homeroom.

696
00:32:56,916 --> 00:32:57,848
I'm Ann's mother.

697
00:32:57,917 --> 00:32:59,544
She's my mother.

698
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:00,551
Hi.

699
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,281
You--You look alike, you two.

700
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,287
- No.
- Oh, thanks.

701
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,687
No, we don't.
I look like my dad.

702
00:33:04,757 --> 00:33:05,689
Just his chin.

703
00:33:05,758 --> 00:33:07,589
I like your chin.
I do.

704
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,820
Anyway, listen, I got to go,

705
00:33:08,895 --> 00:33:10,453
because my mother's
waiting over there,

706
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,760
but Christmas Day,
we're having a party at the house

707
00:33:12,832 --> 00:33:14,060
from 4:00 to 8:00.

708
00:33:14,133 --> 00:33:15,065
Will you come, both of you?

709
00:33:15,134 --> 00:33:16,294
It's our annual thing.

710
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,996
- I--
- Thanks. That's sweet.

711
00:33:18,071 --> 00:33:19,038
Really?
Well, please.

712
00:33:19,105 --> 00:33:21,369
I'll tell you more at school.
Everybody's going to come, though.

713
00:33:21,441 --> 00:33:23,534
- See you later.
- Bye.

714
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:25,542
Hi.

715
00:33:25,611 --> 00:33:27,272
Ann: Everybody likes her.

716
00:33:27,347 --> 00:33:28,439
She's on student council,

717
00:33:28,514 --> 00:33:29,981
and her brother's the editor

718
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,311
of the school newspaper.

719
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,113
What does her father do?

720
00:33:33,186 --> 00:33:34,619
I think he's a doctor.

721
00:33:34,687 --> 00:33:38,054
Huh. Well, it might be fun.

Do you want me to go?

724
00:33:41,494 --> 00:33:42,927
I guess it'll
give us a chance

725
00:33:42,996 --> 00:33:44,725
to kind of show ourselves off,

726
00:33:44,797 --> 00:33:47,357
and the car is looking great again.

Great.

00:34:03,449 --> 00:34:04,711
That's one thing--
People look at us, and they say,

00:34:04,784 --> 00:34:08,686
'' Look at that great-looking
mother and daughter.''

Which one is it, honey?
Point it out.

Do you want to talk to her again?

00:34:34,213 --> 00:34:36,340
Just say merry Christmas.

Areyou going to get dressed?

00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,181
It takes you an hour
to get ready. We're--

The party's going to be over by then.

I thought you said
you wanted to go.

Honey, what I want

761
00:35:25,565 --> 00:35:28,193
is to get all of these pine needles

762
00:35:28,267 --> 00:35:29,632
and vacuum those closets.

763
00:35:29,702 --> 00:35:30,691
They're filled with dust.

00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:32,670
And maybe wash the kitchen floor,

765
00:35:32,738 --> 00:35:33,864
because I realized, sweetheart,

766
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,170
that the thing that's going
to make me most happy

767
00:35:36,242 --> 00:35:37,539
is tojust look around this place

768

and see that it is spick-and-span.

769
00:35:41,981 --> 00:35:44,609
But it's the one fun thing
we can do for Christmas.

770

Well, then, you should go.
You should definitely go.

902
00:41:46,835 --> 00:41:47,859

ice cream on your own.

You went too far
with the ice cream business.

He did not say that.

907
00:41:56,411 --> 00:41:57,742
- Yes, he did.
- No, he did not.

He finds me very attractive.

01:35:35,810 --> 01:35:38,574
Good. You should go.
You might have fun.

1981
01:35:38,646 --> 01:35:40,079
He is not my type.

1982
01:35:40,148 --> 01:35:42,048
He's not my idea of fun.

1983
01:35:42,116 --> 01:35:45,279
Go to Vegas, Mom.
Take a chance.

1984
01:35:45,353 --> 01:35:47,287
You don't have to fall
in love with him.

1985
01:35:47,355 --> 01:35:48,652
I'm not asking you
to even sleep with him.

1986
01:35:48,723 --> 01:35:50,520
Oh, thank you.

1987
01:35:50,591 --> 01:35:52,456
You could win the jackpot even.

1988
01:35:52,527 --> 01:35:55,018
All right, I will go to Vegas.

1989
01:35:55,096 --> 01:35:57,064
Fine. Just stop it.

1990
01:35:57,131 --> 01:35:58,792
But you are going to UCLA.

1991
01:35:58,866 --> 01:36:01,391
It's a state school,
it's all that we can afford,

1992
01:36:01,469 --> 01:36:04,461
and I do not want to hear
another word about it.

1993
01:36:05,773 --> 01:36:07,502
[Exhales]

1994
01:36:10,211 --> 01:36:12,907
''Jackpot.''

1995
01:36:14,582 --> 01:36:16,015
Ann: My mother didn't know it,

1996
01:36:16,084 --> 01:36:18,712
but I'd already applied to
Brown University in Rhode Island.

1997
01:36:18,786 --> 01:36:22,847
Peter tried to talk me
into going to Berkeley,

1998
01:36:22,924 --> 01:36:25,859
but my heart was set
on the East Coast.

1999
01:36:25,927 --> 01:36:27,360
My grades were really good,

2000
01:36:27,428 --> 01:36:30,261
and I thought I could get
a full scholarship.

2001
01:36:30,331 --> 01:36:32,993
I like the part
about the noble soul,

2002
01:36:33,067 --> 01:36:35,467
but do you really read Nietzsche?

2003
01:36:37,371 --> 01:36:38,804
I mean, I read Nietzsche.

2004
01:36:38,873 --> 01:36:40,306
I don't really read Nietzsche.

2005
01:36:40,374 --> 01:36:42,171
[Laughs]

2006
01:36:42,243 --> 01:36:44,438
He'd be a crazy friend to have,
don't you think?

2007
01:36:44,512 --> 01:36:46,571
Mm-hmm.

2008
01:36:46,647 --> 01:36:49,081
Besides, I think people
who read Nietzsche,

2009
01:36:49,150 --> 01:36:52,051
like really read Nietzsche,
are kinda...

2010
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:54,588
I don't know.
Kierkegaard, though, he said that--

2011
01:37:34,335 --> 01:37:35,768
Ann: Where's the mail?

2012
01:37:35,837 --> 01:37:36,861
Where's the mail?

2013
01:37:36,938 --> 01:37:38,303
Right there.

2014
01:37:41,843 --> 01:37:43,003
You opened it.

2015
01:37:43,077 --> 01:37:44,442
Well, how else am I going to know

2016
01:37:44,512 --> 01:37:46,571
how you're planning your life?

2017
01:37:46,647 --> 01:37:48,945
After all, I'm only your mother.

2018
01:37:49,017 --> 01:37:51,315
Wh ywould you confide in me,
thank you very much.

2019
01:37:51,386 --> 01:37:54,378
Go ahead. Open it.

2020
01:37:54,455 --> 01:37:56,650
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

2021
01:37:59,961 --> 01:38:02,156
Providence, Rhode Island?

2022
01:38:02,230 --> 01:38:05,131
Could you have gotten
any farther away from me?

2023
01:38:07,869 --> 01:38:10,337
Look, I just don't understand.

2024
01:38:10,405 --> 01:38:13,169
After all these years,
after all our hard work,

2025
01:38:13,241 --> 01:38:16,233
would it have killed you
to just stick around a bit

2026
01:38:16,310 --> 01:38:18,141
and show some respect
and appreciation

2027
01:38:18,212 --> 01:38:20,271
to the people that have
worried about you

2028
01:38:20,348 --> 01:38:21,372
and loved you

2029
01:38:21,449 --> 01:38:22,575
and have sacrificed
everything for you?

2030
01:38:22,650 --> 01:38:25,847
I'm not going anywhere!

2031
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,081
If you're going to read my mail,
read it carefully.

2032
01:38:28,156 --> 01:38:31,717
They're giving me some money
for tuition and fees,

2033
01:38:31,793 --> 01:38:33,590
but not all ofit,
and we have to pay part ofit.

2034
01:38:33,661 --> 01:38:36,289
And we don't have that.

2035
01:38:36,364 --> 01:38:40,164
Read it.
'' Parents' contributions.''

2036
01:38:40,234 --> 01:38:42,600
God, I wanted it so bad.

2037
01:39:03,491 --> 01:39:06,654
Oh, pooh bear,
it's not the end of the world.

2038
01:39:06,727 --> 01:39:09,127
It is the end of the world!

2039
01:39:09,197 --> 01:39:11,563
Maybe not for you,
but it is for me.

2040
01:39:21,843 --> 01:39:23,174
We could get an ice cream.

2041
01:39:23,244 --> 01:39:24,541
No!

2042
01:39:24,612 --> 01:39:28,446
Can'tyou understand?
I want to go away to college.

2043
01:39:28,516 --> 01:39:31,144
I want to be on my own
and you on your own.

2044
01:39:31,219 --> 01:39:33,653
And I know you're scared
to be without me,

2045
01:39:33,721 --> 01:39:35,586
but I can't help that.

2046
01:39:35,656 --> 01:39:38,216
And I feel bad about that,

2047
01:39:38,292 --> 01:39:41,056
but I don't want
that job anymore.

2048
01:39:41,129 --> 01:39:44,394
Let me live my own life.
Let me go.

2049
01:39:51,572 --> 01:39:52,971
[Door Slams]

2050
01:40:09,857 --> 01:40:12,291
[Siren Whoops]

2051
01:40:13,528 --> 01:40:15,496
Ohh.

2052
01:40:31,779 --> 01:40:32,803
Good afternoon.

2053
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:34,711
You went through that
stop sign back there.

2054
01:40:34,782 --> 01:40:37,080
I need your driver's license
and registration, please.

2055
01:40:39,086 --> 01:40:41,486
You want to take
the driver's license

2056
01:40:41,556 --> 01:40:43,251
out of this, please?

2057
01:40:43,324 --> 01:40:44,916
Oh, my God.

2058
01:40:44,992 --> 01:40:46,516
What?

2059
01:40:46,594 --> 01:40:50,428
You're the one who ran after
my daughter Ann on Christmas.

2060
01:40:50,498 --> 01:40:53,262
You winked at her?
Do you remember?

2061
01:40:53,334 --> 01:40:55,859
Oh, yeah.
I remember you two.

2062
01:40:55,937 --> 01:40:58,428
I know what you told her,
and she hasn't been the same since.

2063
01:40:58,506 --> 01:40:59,905
I'm sorry.
Can I have the driver's license?

2064
01:40:59,974 --> 01:41:01,498
You might have been right.

2065
01:41:01,576 --> 01:41:04,272
It hasn't been perfect, ok?

2066
01:41:04,345 --> 01:41:05,778
Hey, nobody's perfect.

2067
01:41:05,846 --> 01:41:07,609
Exactly. I make mistakes.
That's what I was saying.

2068
01:41:07,682 --> 01:41:11,345
Sometimes maybe
I'm a little bit selfish.

2069
01:41:11,419 --> 01:41:14,047
Maybe sometimes
I'm a little bit irresponsible,

2070
01:41:14,121 --> 01:41:16,351
and the lights go out sometimes.

2071
01:41:16,424 --> 01:41:18,756
But I'm trying.
That's the point, right?

2072
01:41:18,826 --> 01:41:20,623
I am trying. It's not easy.

2073
01:41:20,695 --> 01:41:22,458
I'm sure it's not easy for her, either.

2074
01:41:22,530 --> 01:41:24,498
If I could get
the driver's license from you?

2075
01:41:24,565 --> 01:41:26,396
I know I should have
helped her find her father,

2076
01:41:26,467 --> 01:41:28,628
but I knew that
he would disappoint her,

2077
01:41:28,703 --> 01:41:29,727
and she's better than that.

2078
01:41:29,804 --> 01:41:31,738
So I tried to find her
another father.

2079
01:41:31,806 --> 01:41:33,330
That's completely impossible.

2080
01:41:33,407 --> 01:41:34,840
I'm sure it's very difficult for you.

2081
01:41:34,909 --> 01:41:37,742
Did she tell you any of
the good things that I did?

2082
01:41:37,812 --> 01:41:39,109
'Cause I did a lot of good things.

2083
01:41:39,180 --> 01:41:40,169
I just need the license--

2084
01:41:40,248 --> 01:41:42,910
She's always had
a warm home, food--

2085
01:41:42,984 --> 01:41:45,214
- Lady--
- clothing--

2086
01:41:45,286 --> 01:41:46,480
Lady--

2087
01:41:46,554 --> 01:41:48,715
The best school system.
Did she tell you that?!

2088
01:41:48,789 --> 01:41:51,349
No, ma'am.
Gimme that license, please.

2089
01:41:51,425 --> 01:41:52,357
All right!

2090
01:41:52,426 --> 01:41:54,223
Thank you.

2091

[Sighs]

2092
01:41:55,363 --> 01:41:57,797
You know,
she could have been an actress,

2093
01:41:57,865 --> 01:41:59,924
instead she wants
to go away to college.

2094
01:42:00,001 --> 01:42:01,866
She's telling me that
I have to let her go.

2095
01:42:01,936 --> 01:42:03,699
Well, it's always been
just the two of us,

2096
01:42:03,771 --> 01:42:06,137
and that is very hard.

2097
01:42:06,207 --> 01:42:07,572
I don't get it.

2098
01:42:07,642 --> 01:42:12,477
Doesn't she know
I--I would do anything for her?

2099
01:42:12,546 --> 01:42:14,878
I mean, I love her.

2100
01:42:14,949 --> 01:42:17,577
She is the reason I was born.

2101
01:42:17,652 --> 01:42:20,177
Doesn't she understand
that I would do anything for her?

2102
01:42:25,559 --> 01:42:27,083
Then you know what to do.

2103
01:42:35,369 --> 01:42:36,631
Yeah.

2104
01:42:38,439 --> 01:42:39,371

[Sobs]

2106
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:48,271
I'll tell you what.

2107
01:42:48,349 --> 01:42:50,112
This is what I'm going to do for you.

2108
01:42:50,184 --> 01:42:51,276
I'm gonna let you go.

2109
01:42:51,352 --> 01:42:52,284
Ok.

2110
01:42:52,353 --> 01:42:54,844
Ok? Here's your driver's license.

2111
01:42:54,922 --> 01:42:56,116
Thanks.

2112
01:42:56,190 --> 01:43:00,217
Watch the signs, please.

2113
01:43:00,294 --> 01:43:01,693
Ok?

2114
01:43:01,762 --> 01:43:03,696
And have a nice day.

2115
01:43:03,764 --> 01:43:05,823
You, too.

[Sighs]

2117
01:43:18,312 --> 01:43:21,839
Mmm, it's beautiful.

2118
01:43:21,916 --> 01:43:23,110
It's your color.

2119
01:43:23,184 --> 01:43:24,208
It is, isn't it?

2120
01:43:24,285 --> 01:43:25,843
It makes you look so thin.

2121
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:27,945
Oh, God, well, that's good.

2122
01:43:28,022 --> 01:43:29,683
Call me.

2123
01:43:29,757 --> 01:43:30,689
Oh, honey.

2124
01:43:30,758 --> 01:43:32,225
What are you doing?

2125
01:43:32,293 --> 01:43:34,625
You're home early.
I wanted to surprise you.

2126
01:43:34,695 --> 01:43:36,458
God, this is
a beautiful automobile.

2127
01:43:36,530 --> 01:43:38,293
Janet just bought our car.

2128
01:43:38,366 --> 01:43:39,697
You're selling the car?

2129
01:43:39,767 --> 01:43:41,564
Sold. Ha ha!

2130
01:43:41,635 --> 01:43:43,569
This is my daughter Ann,
you know, going to Brown.

2131
01:43:43,637 --> 01:43:45,867
I was telling her
all about you, sweetie.

2132
01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:47,669
Yeah. I love this car.

2133
01:43:47,742 --> 01:43:49,334
I was out with
a girlfriend in her car,

2134
01:43:49,410 --> 01:43:50,741
and I see your mom driving past.

2135
01:43:50,811 --> 01:43:52,904
When I saw that ''for sale'' sign
in the window,

2136
01:43:52,980 --> 01:43:55,744
I am telling you,
I heard a voice in my head saying,

2137
01:43:55,816 --> 01:43:57,716
''You have to have that car.''

2138
01:43:57,785 --> 01:43:59,582
I mean, I can't even
really afford it,

2139
01:43:59,653 --> 01:44:02,520
but it's, like,
the car that I see in my dreams.

2140
01:44:02,590 --> 01:44:04,148
Mom, why are you doing this?

2141
01:44:04,225 --> 01:44:05,852
What do you mean
I'm going to Brown?

2142
01:44:05,926 --> 01:44:08,918
Sweetie, we can afford it.

2143
01:44:08,996 --> 01:44:10,429
I worked it out.

2144
01:44:10,498 --> 01:44:11,624
I saved a little money in the bank,

2145
01:44:11,699 --> 01:44:13,098
and now with the money from the car--

2146
01:44:13,167 --> 01:44:14,532
I'm applying to UCLA.

2147
01:44:14,602 --> 01:44:19,301
Sweetheart, UCLA is for
surfers and wanna-be starlets.

2148
01:44:19,373 --> 01:44:21,102
She's a serious student.
Go to Brown.

2149
01:44:21,175 --> 01:44:22,972
You can't sell the car.

2150
01:44:23,043 --> 01:44:24,374

2151
01:44:26,213 --> 01:44:28,044
Honey, we're gonna make it work.

01:44:28,115 --> 01:44:29,548
At least for this year.

2153
01:44:29,617 --> 01:44:31,915
We'll worry about next year
next year, right?

2154
01:44:31,986 --> 01:44:33,510
I mean, we're good at that, aren't we?

2155
01:44:33,587 --> 01:44:36,454
Ok. Gonna drive it
away now, girls.

2156
01:44:36,524 --> 01:44:38,424
You can't drive it away.
That's our car.

2157
01:44:38,492 --> 01:44:40,983
That's our Mercedes.
It changed our lives.

2158
01:44:41,061 --> 01:44:42,323
Good luck, Janet!

2159
01:44:42,396 --> 01:44:45,627
Good luck to you, Adele!
Thank you again!

2163
01:45:38,219 --> 01:45:40,119
So I'll come see you at Christmas.

2164
01:45:40,187 --> 01:45:42,587
And in the spring when you come,

2165
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:45,056
I'll make sure I have
that little house at the beach.

2166
01:45:45,125 --> 01:45:48,617
At the end of Carbon Beach
with the blue roof?

2167
01:45:48,696 --> 01:45:50,186
- Ok.
- Ok.

2168
01:45:50,264 --> 01:45:54,223
You bring--You bring
somebody home with you.

2169
01:45:54,301 --> 01:45:56,235
Somebody that I don't know.

2170
01:45:56,303 --> 01:45:58,203
Somebody that I'll like.

2171
01:45:58,272 --> 01:46:00,502
Ok. I will.

2172
01:46:00,574 --> 01:46:03,475
P.A.: United Airlines
flight 1 66 to Boston.

2173

All passengers...

2174

2176
01:46:12,386 --> 01:46:13,944
You look elegant, Mom.

2177
01:46:18,092 --> 01:46:19,684
Oh, look at you.

2178
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:22,661
Ohh...

2179
01:46:22,730 --> 01:46:26,257
You never were
a small-town girl, honey.

2180
01:46:26,333 --> 01:46:28,528
Thanks for knowing that, Mom.

2181
01:46:33,307 --> 01:46:35,207
And wear your seat belt, ok?

2182
01:46:35,276 --> 01:46:36,368
Mm-hmm.

2183
01:46:40,881 --> 01:46:42,815
Ok. Ok.

2184
01:46:45,219 --> 01:46:47,084
And--And make a list of all the books

2185
01:46:47,154 --> 01:46:48,348
that you're reading
so I can keep up.

2186
01:46:48,422 --> 01:46:49,753
Ok.

2187
01:47:00,234 --> 01:47:02,031
I love you.

2188
01:47:02,102 --> 01:47:05,299
I love you, too, sweetie.

2189
01:47:08,242 --> 01:47:09,504
Bye.

2190

  Be optimistic

  Don't you be a grumpy

 When the road gets bumpy 

2193
01:47:24,258 --> 01:47:26,249
 Just smile, smile, smile

even if you hate her,

even if she's ruining your life,

01:48:06,166 --> 01:48:09,693
there's--there's
something about my mother.

2200
01:48:09,770 --> 01:48:11,965
Some romance...

2201
01:48:12,039 --> 01:48:13,438
some power.

2202
01:48:15,843 --> 01:48:18,311
And when she dies...

2203
01:48:18,379 --> 01:48:20,745
the world will be flat.

2204
01:48:20,814 --> 01:48:25,114
Too simple, too fair...

2205
01:48:25,185 --> 01:48:26,482
too reasonable.

2206
01:48:26,553 --> 01:48:28,521
Ooh! Gosh, you pack
quite a wallop.

2207
01:48:28,589 --> 01:48:30,147
Oh, excuse me.

2208
01:48:30,224 --> 01:48:31,125
Are you ok?

2209
01:48:31,125 --> 01:48:31,648
Are you ok?

2210
01:48:31,725 --> 01:48:33,454
I'm fine. Thanks.

  Free to find myway 

2213
01:48:45,472 --> 01:48:48,737
  I know at times
I act a little crazy 

2214
01:48:49,977 --> 01:48:54,311
 And I made mistakes along the way 

2215
01:48:54,381 --> 01:48:56,975
  But I can see the silver lining  

2216
01:48:57,051 --> 01:48:58,882
  It's about to bring a change

  Free to find myway

 You can't stay there

01:50:21,068 --> 01:50:24,663
  No matter how much you want  

2231
01:50:24,738 --> 01:50:27,366
 Tears flow  

2232
01:50:27,441 --> 01:50:29,636
  Sad words are said  

2233
01:50:29,710 --> 01:50:33,305
  But in my heart  

2234
01:50:33,380 --> 01:50:36,975
 The story won't end  

2235
01:50:37,050 --> 01:50:39,883
 You'll still be there  

2236
01:50:39,953 --> 01:50:43,912
  In everything that I do  

2237
01:50:43,991 --> 01:50:48,553
 And wherever I go
