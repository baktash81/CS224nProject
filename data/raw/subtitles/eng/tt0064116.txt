1
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,912
If you want to buy ticket,

2
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,958
you'll have to go to the front.

3
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,912
This place is forbidden to enter

4
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,911
Well, I suppose it'll be alright.

5
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,949
What the hell am I doing around here?

6
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,911
Let me check it, I hope I have some left.

7
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,956
Three

8
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,910
That'll be seven dollars...

9
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,958
..and 50 cents.

10
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,958
Number ten.

11
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,956
Number ten.

12
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,958
Do not step in unless you are invited.

13
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,956
Frank?

14
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,958
Frank sent us.

15
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,958
Did you bring a horse for me?

16
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,871
Hey, guys.

17
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,956
Well, looks like we're...

18
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,958
Looks like we're shy of one horse.

19
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,958
You brought two too many.

20
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,956
Pa! Look!

21
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,949
That's enough for now.
It's getting late. Come on home.

22
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,956
Timmy.

23
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,911
Maureen, look.

24
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,956
These...

25
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,956
Ah...

26
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,912
What you doing there?

27
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,958
Go inside, quick, and get washed.
And don't touch the apple pie or the roast.

28
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,912
Patrick's already left
for the station.

29
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,911
He's getting ready, Pa.

30
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,910
- Damn it, Patrick!

31
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,956
- Coming, Pa.

32
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,956
Not bad, I'd say.

33
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,913
Bigger, them slices. What the hell?
We're throwing a party, ain't we?

34
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,958
But these are
the same slices as usual.

35
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,911
Yeah, sure.

36
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,912
As usual.

37
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,956
Maureen.

38
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,912
Soon, you can cut the bread in slices
as big as a door if you want to.

39
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,949
You'll have beautiful new clothes
and you won't have to work no more.

40
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,958
We're going to get rich, Pa?

41
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,956
Who knows?

42
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,911
Patrick!

43
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,956
Wait a minute!

44
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,959
Look at the filth on your boots.
Clean 'em.

45
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,915
The train'll come in and there
won't be no one to meet your mother.

46
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,959
Our mother died six years ago.

47
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,959
Go now, or you'll really be late.

48
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,912
Just a minute. Listen, Pa.
How will I recognize her?

49
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,915
You can't make no mistake, Patrick.

50
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,911
She's young and she's pretty

51
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,912
and she's a lady.

52
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,910
This...look at this.

53
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,912
"For traveling,
I'll be wearing a black dress

54
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,958
and the same straw hat

55
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,959
that I was wearing when we met."

56
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,911
Maureen.

57
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,959
I'm gonna get
some fresh water from the well.

58
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,956
Oh, Danny boy

59
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,912
The pipes, the pipes are calling

60
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,958
And down the mountain side

61
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,911
The summer's gone

62
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,958
And all the roses fall...

63
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,956
Maureen!

64
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,959
What are we gonna do with this one,
Frank?

65
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,959
Now that you've called me by name...

66
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,958
Hold on, hold on.

67
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,912
- I saw some fine stock down south.
- That so?

68
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,958
And the prices are good.

69
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,915
- These your valises, ma'am?
- Yes.

70
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,949
- Come, Sarah.
- Bring them other two.

71
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,913
Very nice lady, this morning.

72
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,913
Is that true? The sawmill needs hands?
Was yesterday. Why didn't you tell your brother?

73
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,959
- Hiya, Gramps.
- Hiya, Bill. We're back again.

74
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,912
Come on. Get a move on, will you?

75
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,959
Come on. Get a move on, will you?

76
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,910
I got a whole train to unload.

77
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,958
Alright,
chuck down those feed sacks first.

78
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,949
What's the name
of the place you wanted to go?

79
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,912
Brett McBain's farm.

80
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,911
McBain? Yeah, sure.

81
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,911
That stubborn redheaded Irishman,

82
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,912
tilling sand for years
out in the middle of nowhere.

83
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,911
Sweetwater! Only a loony like him

84
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,912
Sweetwater! Only a loony like him could call
that stinking piece of desert Sweetwater.

85
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,958
Sweetwater!

86
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,911
A little more to the right.

87
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,956
Higher.

88
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,956
Hold it there.

89
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,910
Here they are.
Even got here with their damn rails.

90
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,912
They caught up with us again,
eh, Lafayette? Let's go!

91
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,911
Slow down.
What's the matter with you?

92
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,910
Watch out down there!

93
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,956
Slow down!

94
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,992
Don't be so hurry.

95
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,912
Why are we stopping?
I told you I was in a hurry.

96
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,958
Don't the train stop?

97
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,912
What can I do for you, ma'am?

98
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,960
I would like some water,

99
00:34:59,995 --> 00:35:00,915
if it's no trouble.

100
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,913
Water? That word is poison
around these parts

101
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,912
ever since the days
of the great flood.

102
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,912
- You mean you never wash?
- We sure do!

103
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,912
I'd like to use the same facilities
you people do.

104
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,913
You sure can. Just happen
to have a full tub at the back.

105
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,912
You're lucky. Only three people
have used it this morning.

106
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,959
Used it one at a time
or all together?

107
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,913
I can tell
you're accustomed to fine living.

108
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,911
Bet you come from
one of those big eastern cities.

109
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,910
- New Orleans.

110
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,956
- New Orleans!

111
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,911
- You've been there?
- No.

112
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:45,069
But I got a cousin down there.
She runs a bar.
You know, she...

113
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,956
Jug.

114
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,949
Do you only know how to play
or do you know how to shoot?

115
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,959
Do you know
how to blow music from that?

116
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,910
Pick it up.

117
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,956
Pick it up.

118
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,956
You!

119
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,958
You don't know how to play.

120
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,956
Try this one.

121
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,956
Take it.

122
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,956
Go on. Here.

123
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,956
Bravo.

124
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,912
Cheyenne.
We thought we'd never make it.

125
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,958
It's alright. You're right on time.

126
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,958
To bury my escort.

127
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,949
If I'd waited for you,
I'd be in jail by now.

128
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,956
Hey,

129
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,956
The gun.

130
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,959
You interested in fashions,
Harmonica?

131
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,950
I saw three of these dusters
a short time ago. They were waiting for a train.

132
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,959
Inside the dusters,
there were three men.

133
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,911
So?

134
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,959
Inside the men,
there were three bullets.

135
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,958
That's a crazy story, Harmonica.

136
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,958
For two reasons.

137
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,915
One, nobody around these parts got
the guts to wear those dusters except Cheyenne's, man.

138
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,911
Two,

139
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,958
Cheyenne's, man,
don't get killed.

140
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,911
That surprise you?

141
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,956
Yeah.

142
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,913
Well, you know music.

143
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,911
And you can count?

144
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,958
All the way up to two?

145
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,958
All the way up to six, if I have to.

146
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,912
And maybe faster than you.

147
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,956
Yeah, go on.

148
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,956
Play, Harmonica.

149
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,958
Play, so you can't bullshit.

150
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,958
Only, watch those false notes.

151
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,956
Like so?

152
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,911
Continue what we said just now.

153
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,913
This cousin of mine keeps writing me
to come down to New Orleans.

154
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,949
"Come on down. Help me with the bar.
Make a pile of money."

155
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,910
I don't think
I'd get along in a big city.

156
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,912
It's too full
of fast men and loose women.

157
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,958
Begging your pardon, ma'am. No.

158
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,959
Now, I'm too used to
a quiet simple country life.

159
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,956
He's Timmy.

160
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,956
Yes.

161
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,911
He's Timmy.

162
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,911
Dear God.

163
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:09,910
On the day...

164
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,911
On the very day of your wedding.

165
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,958
Poor little miss.

166
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,949
- Mrs. McBain.
- But we all... We thought...

167
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,915
I know. It was to be a surprise today.

168
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,949
Brett McBain and I were married.
A month ago.

169
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,956
In New Orleans.

170
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,958
I am the resurrection and the life.

171
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,959
He who believeth in me, though
he were dead, yet shall he live.

172
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,959
Whosoever liveth and believeth in me
shall never die. Amen.

173
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,959
- Mr. Bennett!
- What's he doing here?

174
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,949
I found this collar
on a nail by the door.

175
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,913
You got no way of knowing,
but this is as good as a signature.

176
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,912
Cheyenne's hand.

177
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,912
- But why?
- Don't worry, Mrs. McBain.

178
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,911
We'll make 'em tell us
before we hang 'em.

179
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,956
Let's get moving.

180
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,959
Come on.
Let's go back to Flagstone.

181
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,956
No, Sam.

182
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,911
You go back.

183
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,913
You don't want
to stay out here alone.

184
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,958
Why not? This is my home.

185
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,958
You know, Wobbles...

186
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,958
..I'm kinda mad at you.

187
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,958
Frank wasn't there.

188
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,913
- He sent three friends.
- I don't know nothing, I swear.

189
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,959
I only arranged the meeting
the way you wanted it.

190
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,912
I don't know why Frank wasn't there.

191
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,912
- I swear to you that I...
- Cos he was at the McBains'.

192
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,912
That's not true.
Cheyenne did that job.

193
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,911
Everyone knows that. We got proof.

194
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,949
That was always one
of Frank's tricks. Faking evidence.

195
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,911
I don't know. I swear.

196
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,911
I only arranged the meeting. I swear.

197
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,959
I don't know nothing.

198
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,956
Who's there?

199
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,958
Did you make coffee?

200
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,956
Make it.

201
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,912
Didn't sleep a wink.

202
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,949
A pack of turds dressed in black
rode herd on me the whole damn night.

203
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,912
Yeah, but I left them
in the middle of the desert.

204
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,949
If they're lucky,
they'll be home in three days.

205
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,958
I'll do it. You fetch the coffee.

206
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,913
They want to hang me,
the big black crows.

207
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,958
Idiots. What the hell?

208
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,913
I'll kill anything, but never a kid.

209
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,912
Be like killing a priest.

210
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,911
A Catholic priest, that is.

211
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,959
Yeah, the world is full of people
who hate Cheyenne.

212
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,959
See, I am not
the mean bastard people make out.

213
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,958
Of course, if somebody
had a mind to kill me...

214
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,958
..it fires me up.

215
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,958
And a fired-up Cheyenne...

216
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,912
..ain't a nice thing to see.

217
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,958
Especially for a lady.

218
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,959
But you're too smart to make him mad.

219
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,949
So this here's where I was
supposed to do all the killing?

220
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,958
Yeah.

221
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,756
Don't seem the place is worth a shit.

222
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,913
Now, if somebody gets dressed up
to look like me...

223
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,959
..so they can hang this thing
around my neck...

224
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,912
..I don't like it none.

225
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,958
But I can understand it.

226
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,959
What I don't understand is why.

227
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,958
Neither do I.

228
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,959
But I see you looked a lot
for the why.

229
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,956
Yeah.

230
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,913
What if there were
a whole heap of whys?

231
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,956
Round. Yellow.

232
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,912
You know the kind.

233
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,912
You rap them on a stone...

234
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,912
..and they go "ding".

235
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,956
Maybe.

236
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,958
By the way,

237
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,911
But I didn't find them.

238
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,959
you know anything about a man
going around playing a harmonica?

239
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,958
He's somebody you'd remember.

240
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,912
Instead of talking, he plays.

241
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,959
And when he'd better play, he talks.

242
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,949
You know, when you've killed four,
it's easy to make it five.

243
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,958
Sure. You're an expert.

244
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,959
Madam, it seems to me
you can't caught the idea.

245
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,956
Of course I have.

246
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,912
I'm here alone in the hands
of a bandit who smelled money.

247
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:22,950
If you want to, you can lay me
over the table and amuse yourself.
And even call in your men.

248
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,911
Well, no woman ever died from that.

249
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,912
When you're finished, all I'll need
will be a tub of boiling water,

250
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,912
and I'll be exactly
what I was before.

251
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,959
With just another filthy memory.

252
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,958
You make good coffee, at least.

253
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,956
Not bad.

254
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,913
Tell me, was it necessary
that you kill all of them?

255
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,912
I only told you to scare them.

256
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,912
People scare better
when they're dying.

257
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,959
And can you tell me
what good was your stupid massacre?

258
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,959
Now, a Mrs. McBain has turned up.

259
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,958
So, I didn't expect that.
It happens in business.

260
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,912
Let's say
this is something I didn't plan on.

261
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,959
I have no time for surprises, Frank.

262
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,912
You know that.

263
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,958
I got on board
in sight of the Atlantic,

264
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,912
and before my eyes rot,

265
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,949
I want to see the blue of the Pacific
outside that window.

266
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,949
I know where you got on board.
I was there, too, remember.

267
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,959
To remove small obstacles
from the track, you said.

268
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,958
Well, there were a few.

269
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,912
But we traveled a long way,
just the same.

270
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,911
And fast.

271
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,959
Even tuberculosis of the bones
travels fast.

272
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,913
Don't play the sick man with me,
Mr. Morton.

273
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,959
I knew you
when you were just barely limping.

274
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,959
I watch that dry rot
rise a little more every day.

275
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,911
Any normal man'd
put a bullet in his brain.

276
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,912
But you,
you just got a little more hasty.

277
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,913
Otherwise you ain't changed any.

278
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,959
I'd say you've changed, Frank.

279
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,959
You used to take care
of certain things personally.

280
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,913
Now, you're keeping
in the background.

281
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,913
You'll end up giving orders.

282
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,949
It's because, now, I don't want
to leave you alone too much.

283
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,913
You're gonna need somebody more
and more every day to stay near you.

284
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,959
- Like a friend.
- Or like a partner.

285
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,949
How does it feel
sitting behind that desk, Frank?

286
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,958
It's almost like holding a gun.

287
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,958
Only much more powerful.

288
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,959
You see, staying with you, I...

289
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,958
..I'm beginning to think big, too.

290
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,958
This McBain business...

291
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,958
..has given me ideas.

292
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,949
I'm sorry for you, Frank.
You're doing your best.

293
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,913
You'll never succeed
in becoming like me.

294
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,956
Why?

295
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,959
Because there are many things
you'll never understand.

296
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,958
This is one of them.

297
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,912
You see, Frank,
there are many kinds of weapons.

298
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,959
And the only one
that can stop that is this.

299
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,915
Now, shall we get back
to our little problem?

300
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,913
My weapons might look simple to you,
Mr. Morton,

301
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,915
but they can still shoot holes
big enough for our little problems.

302
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,915
Pretty soon the widow McBain
won't be a problem no more.

303
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,913
You wake up one morning and say,
"World, I know you."

304
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,912
"From now on,
there are no more surprises."

305
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,912
And then you happen to meet
a man like this,
who looked like a good man.

306
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,912
Clear eyes, strong hands.

307
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,959
And he wants to marry you.
Which doesn't happen often.

308
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,959
And he says he's rich, too,
which doesn't hurt.

309
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,958
So you think,
"The hell with New Orleans."

310
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,959
"Now I'll say yes
and go live in the country."

311
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,911
"I wouldn't mind giving him
half a dozen kids after all."

312
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,959
"Take care of a house. Do something.
What the hell?"

313
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,912
Well, God rest your soul,
Brett McBain.

314
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:08,950
Even if he's going to have a job
pulling you out of the devil's grip.

315
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,915
Still, I swear
he'd left money around someplace.

316
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,912
If you can find it,
you're welcome to it.

317
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,912
Mrs. McBain goes back to civilization.

318
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,959
Minus a husband
and plus a great future.

319
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,958
You deserve better.

320
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,949
The last man who told me that
is buried out there.

321
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,959
You know, Jill,
you remind me of my mother.

322
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,912
She was the biggest whore
in Alameida

323
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,912
and the finest woman that ever lived.

324
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,913
Whoever my father was,
for an hour or for a month...

325
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,959
..he must have been a happy man.

326
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,912
What do you want?

327
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,949
Cheyenne's right. Once you've killed
four, it's easy to make it five.

328
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,958
This isn't the time to leave.

329
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,958
Give me some water.

330
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,956
From the well.

331
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,958
I like my water fresh.

332
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,912
When you hear a strange sound,
drop to the ground.

333
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,958
A sound? Like what?

334
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,956
Like that.

335
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,959
He not only plays, he can shoot, too.

336
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,911
Morning, Mrs. McBain.

337
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,911
- What brings you to town?
- Good morning.

338
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,912
Maybe you don't remember,
but yesterday at the funeral...

339
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,911
I remember very well.

340
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,913
Is there something I can do for you?

341
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,956
Yes.

342
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,912
See Frank.
And tell him I know everything.

343
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,911
Why is everybody hounding me
about this guy Frank?

344
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,913
I don't know him.
I've never heard of him.

345
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,912
I've been troubled by myself, please leave me alone.

346
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,915
Tell Frank that I want to make a deal with him, secretly.

347
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,956
You were told
not to come here for any reason.

348
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,913
Whatever business you have with
Frank,

349
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,912
keep it far away from here.

350
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,959
I know, but when I heard that woman
say she knew everything,

351
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,911
I thought I should come over here
and tell you about it.

352
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,911
You never thought it wasn't a trick?

353
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,915
Sure, but you know
I'm mighty careful.

354
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,911
No one could have followed me.

355
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,915
That's the first thing I learned,
working for you. To listen unseen
and to watch unheard.

356
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,911
You should learn
to live as if you didn't exist.

357
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,915
You've known me a long time, Frank.
You know you can trust me.

358
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,956
Wobbles.

359
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,913
How can you trust a man who wears
both a belt and suspenders?

360
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,959
The man
can't even trust his own pants.

361
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,958
Let's get out of here.

362
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,958
Let's get out of here.

363
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:34,236
Let's get out of here.

364
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,911
The end of the line.
Yeah.

365
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,956
Get him on board.

366
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,958
Tie him up.

367
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,911
Wait, Frank. I didn't...

368
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,912
So, nobody followed you?

369
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,912
No. You gotta believe me.

370
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,912
So, this is the way I can trust you.

371
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,912
I can explain.
I didn't know that he...

372
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:45,910
I can explain.
I didn't know that he...

373
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,958
- Get out.
- No, Frank.

374
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,958
- Get out.
- Frank, wait!

375
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,958
I told you to keep quiet.

376
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,911
Did Logan and Jim
take care of the woman?

377
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,913
Someone took care of them.
We found them out at McBain's place.

378
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,913
Stone dead.
And the woman was gone.

379
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,959
Your friends
have a high mortality rate, Frank.

380
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,959
First three, then two.

381
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,912
So you're the one
who makes appointments.

382
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,958
And you're the one
who doesn't keep 'em.

383
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,959
What do you want?
Who are you?

384
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,958
Dave Jenkins.

385
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,913
Dave Jenkins is dead a long time ago.

386
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,956
Calder Benson.

387
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,913
What's your name?
Benson's dead, too.

388
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,913
You ought to know better than anyone.
You killed 'em.

389
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:01,959
- Who are you, you...
- Frank!

390
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,958
The woman.
