3
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:13,437
I think I found the problem.

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,407
There's a discrepancy
in the date of the land grant.

5
00:00:16,506 --> 00:00:18,007
- Discrepancy?
- Yes.

6
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,678
Captain Daniel Mass
received a land grant

7
00:00:20,777 --> 00:00:24,948
of 300 acres in November 1721.
But...

8
00:00:26,584 --> 00:00:29,520
Captain Mass was in England
at the time.

9
00:00:29,753 --> 00:00:32,355
He didn't return to the colonies
until 1723.

10
00:00:32,456 --> 00:00:35,159
Which means he couldn't have
helped settle the region

11
00:00:35,258 --> 00:00:37,626
until two years
after he was given the land!

12
00:00:37,727 --> 00:00:39,596
- Shh!
- (WHISPERS) Given the land.

13
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,831
Exactly.
Because he wasn't even here.

14
00:00:41,898 --> 00:00:43,433
I don't know how to thank you,
Taylor.

15
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,769
This is the last piece
of the puzzle.

16
00:00:46,035 --> 00:00:49,572
Now I can get back to my book.
I have to call my publisher.

17
00:00:49,639 --> 00:00:51,908
(CHUCKLES) Well, I'm happy
to help, Dr. Sadler.

18
00:00:51,974 --> 00:00:54,611
Digging up history,
it's what I love to do.

19
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:57,982
Uh, be sure to send me a copy
when it gets finished.

20
00:00:58,382 --> 00:00:59,650
Excuse me.

21
00:01:00,785 --> 00:01:02,519
It's like you have
a sixth sense.

22
00:01:02,618 --> 00:01:04,421
(CHUCKLES)
Well, there's still some stuff

23
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,656
that you can't find
on the internet.

24
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,126
(CHUCKLES) Do you have a second
to talk? Did you get my message?

25
00:01:09,692 --> 00:01:12,795
Yeah. I can't believe it.
Why would they cut

26
00:01:12,862 --> 00:01:14,697
our library's funding
like that?

27
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:17,834
The city depends on grants
to help meet our budget.

28
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:21,272
When those grants dry up,
the city has no choice.

29
00:01:21,805 --> 00:01:23,641
And without that funding...

30
00:01:24,475 --> 00:01:28,044
You can't afford
a research librarian on staff.

31
00:01:28,112 --> 00:01:29,246
LINDA: I'm sorry, Taylor.

32
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:31,148
I'm already looking
for other funding.

33
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:33,117
The second
I can bring you back, I...

34
00:01:34,383 --> 00:01:36,352
We're gonna miss you so much.

35
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,190
- Not as much as I'm going to miss you, Linda.

and find funding,</i>

38
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:52,568
but that could take months.

39
00:01:52,636 --> 00:01:54,538
I've called everyone I know,
but nobody's hiring.

40
00:01:54,605 --> 00:01:57,907
- CRAIG: It's gonna be okay, sis.
- TAYLOR: <i>Will it? That was my dream job, Craig.</i>

41
00:01:57,975 --> 00:01:59,776
I know, and you were good
at it, too, okay?

42
00:01:59,877 --> 00:02:01,478
But trust me, Taylor,
you'll find another job

43
00:02:01,578 --> 00:02:03,046
before you know it.

44
00:02:03,347 --> 00:02:05,149
What do I do in the meantime?

45
00:02:05,915 --> 00:02:07,683
Hey, you know what?
I got a good idea.

46
00:02:08,017 --> 00:02:09,720
Why don't you come down here
and visit?

47
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,689
Christine and I
have plenty of room,

I mean, that does sound nice,
but I have to find another job.

51
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:22,031
Well, you can keep looking
while you're down here.

52
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,233

53
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:24,767

with her aunt.

Oh, I do miss her.

55
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:29,072
So? What's stopping you?

56
00:02:29,373 --> 00:02:32,943
(LAUGHS) I'll think about it.

(ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING)

58
00:02:58,368 --> 00:03:02,273
- Ray, sorry I'm late. I got up early to help my dad.
- RAY: Man, I still can't believe

59
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:04,275
you grew up
on a ranch in Montana.

60
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:07,144
Oh, come on, man, my family
in Forest Ridge go way back.

61
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,647
My great-great-grandfather
cleared the land for that ranch.

62
00:03:09,714 --> 00:03:11,014
Yeah, you told me,
him and Daniel Boone.

63
00:03:11,113 --> 00:03:12,849
Look, it's just so far away
from you busting sod

Come on, man, you gotta love
this place, right?

67
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,692
Every time I come here,
it's like stepping back in time.

68
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,995
Which is why it's costing

69
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:27,665
so much money to bring it
into the 21st century.

70
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:29,599
Have you taken a good look
at that electric panel?

71
00:03:29,732 --> 00:03:30,933
Yeah, did you talk to Lyle first

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,402
- about doing the rewiring?
- Yeah, about that.

73
00:03:33,502 --> 00:03:35,005
Your buddy's been keeping it
a bit too high.

74
00:03:35,072 --> 00:03:37,341
Okay, well, I'm not sure
I'd call him my buddy, but...

75
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:39,343
He said you two have known
each other since grade school.

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,980
- Regardless, I hear he's a good electrician.
- And I'm your business manager.

Okay, I really appreciate
this passion project of yours,

78
00:03:46,016 --> 00:03:48,651
but it's my job
to watch the bottom line.

79
00:03:49,619 --> 00:03:52,888
I know, Ray, it just...
it makes a lot of sense

80
00:03:52,956 --> 00:03:54,857
to hire as many locals
as possible, you know?

81
00:03:54,924 --> 00:03:56,761
No. Not if it's gonna put us
over budget.

- you could be out of practice driving in it.
- I'll be okay, all right?

I promise.
Hey, let me ask you something.

Do you know

113
00:05:27,683 --> 00:05:30,053
anything about this town meeting
tomorrow night?

114
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,656
- Yeah, the one about the hotel?
- Yeah. Why didn't you tell me?

115
00:05:34,058 --> 00:05:35,959
Well, I figured you knew
about it.

116
00:05:36,092 --> 00:05:37,960
I mean, you grew up here, Joel.

117
00:05:38,327 --> 00:05:40,930

something on their mind,

118

- they're not shy about speaking up.
- JOEL: Yeah, that I do.

119

So, what is it exactly
on their mind?

120
00:05:49,873 --> 00:05:52,009
They barely see you
around here anymore.

121
00:05:52,108 --> 00:05:54,512

say you're gonna turn

you know, if anyone
comes looking for you,

171
00:09:22,985 --> 00:09:26,322
- they'll know where to find ya.
- Well, that's very thoughtful of you. Thank you.

JOEL: Easy.

173
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,193
So, uh, you know,
before I do commit to this,

174
00:09:31,324 --> 00:09:33,129
- which way are you headed?
- (CHUCKLES) I'm actually heading

175
00:09:33,196 --> 00:09:34,930
to a small town
called Forest Ridge.

176
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:38,300

let's get you out of the cold.

Uh, Joel.

Uh, my big brother lives here
with his family.

I've actually
never been here before.

187
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,169
Well, I might be
slightly biased,

188
00:10:12,235 --> 00:10:15,238
being that I'm, well,
from here, but... (CHUCKLES)

189
00:10:15,973 --> 00:10:17,808
there's no place quite like it.

- You've been already so helpful.
- JOEL: All right.

meeting you, Taylor.

rescuing me.

of pace from going to Seattle

- all the time, right?
- Yup, I made it! Four years later, here I am!

- Uh, it was very... exhilarating.

in a ditch right now,

223

- but a kind stranger gave me a lift and dropped me off.
- Why didn't you give me a call?

224
00:12:20,497 --> 00:12:22,431
- I had no signal.
- Ah, right.

225

- Were you scared?
- (LAUGHS) I was cold,

a tow truck in the morning.

- Absolutely. Yeah, no problem.
- Okay.

Well, dinner's almost ready.
Why don't you get settled in?

by the time they're 30.

That doesn't sound so bad.

261
00:14:19,047 --> 00:14:22,318
Yeah, except for the fact
that the only books they read

262
00:14:22,384 --> 00:14:24,420
are on tiny little screens.

329
00:17:50,192 --> 00:17:53,496
I don't know. You seem like
more of a truck guy to me.

330
00:17:53,763 --> 00:17:57,267
- Do I? Hmm.
- TAYLOR: (CHUCKLES) I mean, you did just tell me

331
00:17:57,334 --> 00:17:58,968
a story about a cow.

332
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:00,303
It's a true story.

333
00:18:00,504 --> 00:18:02,405
I just don't know if it'll fit
in the back of your auto.

334
00:18:02,471 --> 00:18:04,039
Oh, it's roomier than it looks.

- (LAUGHS)
- (LAUGHS) Um, listen, I really appreciate

336
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:10,213
you calling me a tow truck,
but I cannot let you pay for it.

337
00:18:10,412 --> 00:18:12,481
No, of course not.
No, absolutely not.

338
00:18:12,548 --> 00:18:13,616
I wouldn't dream of it.

339
00:18:13,984 --> 00:18:16,186
I mean, come on, we just met.
It's a little forward. (MUMBLES)

340
00:18:16,253 --> 00:18:17,654
But what I will do

341
00:18:17,754 --> 00:18:19,656
is I'm gonna write
my number down right here

342
00:18:19,988 --> 00:18:21,857
and I'm gonna give it to you.
What you do with it,

343
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,392
you know, that's on your
own accord, but I'm hoping

344
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,129
maybe, just maybe,
you'll call me,

345
00:18:27,697 --> 00:18:32,869
and maybe we go grab coffee,
and then... you can pay me back.

346
00:18:33,335 --> 00:18:34,738
What do you say?

347
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,741
It's a deal.

348
00:18:40,109 --> 00:18:41,511
Well, all right then.

349
00:18:42,577 --> 00:18:45,614

our little town so far?

- It used to be. It's way more casual now.

for the whole town. (CHUCKLES)

about your car this morning

and they said
it was already taken care of.

- How are ya?
- TAYLOR: Uh, yeah, looks like my kind stranger

372
00:19:47,008 --> 00:19:49,245
- came through again.
- Does this kind stranger have a name?

373
00:19:49,311 --> 00:19:50,847
(LAUGHING) I know that look.

374

of the place?

It really is so lovely.

377

- CRAIG: Yeah, it's over 100 years old,

378
00:20:03,992 --> 00:20:06,161
and all things considered,
she could go for another 100.

from getting completely gutted.

380
00:20:08,596 --> 00:20:11,166
- What do you mean?
- There's some developers. And they say they can bring

381
00:20:11,267 --> 00:20:13,803
more money into town
if they bring in more businesses

382
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,671
and tourists and stuff.
All we have to do

383
00:20:15,738 --> 00:20:18,074
is turn this
into a fancy new resort.

as I was to see her.

for you

that should be preserved

it should be sacrificed

00:26:06,455 --> 00:26:09,292
by attracting visitors
every year.

491
00:26:11,494 --> 00:26:14,930
That's the goal.
You see, but what they realized

492
00:26:15,064 --> 00:26:18,100
was that, as important
as their history is,

493
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:20,135
they can't let it
hold them back.

494
00:26:20,369 --> 00:26:22,438
They need to move
into the 21st century.

495
00:26:22,505 --> 00:26:27,677
They need to plan ahead
for the future, and so do we.

496
00:26:28,244 --> 00:26:31,046
The plans that we have
for the Graff Hotel,

497
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,315
they're gonna be good
for this town.

498
00:26:33,649 --> 00:26:37,286
That's why we need this council
to endorse these permits.

499
00:26:37,486 --> 00:26:41,591
It's for us, so we can take
that next step forward

500
00:26:41,723 --> 00:26:43,591
and prepare for the future.

501
00:26:44,026 --> 00:26:46,695
'Cause we don't want our history
to hold us back.

- (CROWD MURMURING)
- Oh. Again, my name is Joel Sheenan,

503
00:26:51,534 --> 00:26:54,436
- and I thank you for your time.
- (CROWD CHEERING, APPLAUDING)

504
00:26:55,003 --> 00:26:56,539
I actually have a question.

505
00:26:56,905 --> 00:27:00,409
- Sure.
- Isn't the Graff Hotel 100 years old?

506
00:27:01,311 --> 00:27:04,547
So that means it's eligible
for a landmark status.

507
00:27:04,713 --> 00:27:05,980
PHYLLIS: For landmark status,

508
00:27:06,047 --> 00:27:08,084
the state of Montana says
we have to prove

509
00:27:08,317 --> 00:27:11,119
that a significant
historical event took place

510
00:27:11,219 --> 00:27:13,389
- involving the building.
- That's exactly right.

511
00:27:13,455 --> 00:27:17,226
Thank you, Phyllis. And, uh,
according to our research,

512
00:27:17,293 --> 00:27:19,328
there's no evidence of that
with the Graff Hotel.

513
00:27:19,494 --> 00:27:22,898
- Well, who did this research?
- Well, I hired

514
00:27:22,965 --> 00:27:25,134
some extremely reputable experts
to look into it.

515
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,268
You mean your company
hired people

516
00:27:27,335 --> 00:27:29,104
to look up the landmark status
for a building

517
00:27:29,171 --> 00:27:31,172
that you want to develop?
(SCOFFS)

518
00:27:31,273 --> 00:27:34,142
Um... (CLEARS THROAT)
You could put it that way, yeah.

519
00:27:34,209 --> 00:27:35,478
Okay, so you're saying

520
00:27:35,545 --> 00:27:37,246
that if we find
a significant event

521
00:27:37,313 --> 00:27:39,915
happened at the Graff,
and then the hotel would be preserved?

522
00:27:40,047 --> 00:27:42,984
According
to the state of Montana, yes.

523
00:27:43,051 --> 00:27:45,087
Well, I don't know,
maybe Mr. Sheenan's idea

524
00:27:45,153 --> 00:27:47,922
of significant is really just
in his own best interest.

525
00:27:47,989 --> 00:27:50,191
Oh, okay. Okay, okay. (CHUCKLES)

526
00:27:50,258 --> 00:27:52,094
- Look, that's a little far...
- CRAIG: Uh, Phyllis?

527
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,330
Maybe we could take some time
to explore this,

528
00:27:55,396 --> 00:27:58,934
uh, before the council makes
their final decision?

529
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,404
PHYLLIS: All right.
This is what we'll do.

530
00:28:01,504 --> 00:28:03,171
We'll take a week
to look this over,

531
00:28:03,238 --> 00:28:06,440
then we'll reconvene and hear
what everyone has to say.

532
00:28:07,042 --> 00:28:08,878
- Any objections?
- (CROWD MURMURING)

533
00:28:08,943 --> 00:28:11,046

(GASPS) You did it!

I just got the ball started.
We still gotta find some proof.

Yeah, but this looks like this
is really in your wheelhouse.

What do you say?
Wanna give us a hand with this?

540

Yeah, sure.

541
00:28:34,737 --> 00:28:35,772
Great.

quite the impression last night.

544

Everybody's talking about it.

545
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,115
I got to admit,
I was a little surprised,

546
00:28:47,283 --> 00:28:48,884
the way you called out
Joel Sheenan like that.

547
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:51,120
Yeah, well,
he threw me a curveball too.

548
00:28:51,586 --> 00:28:53,888
Do you remember that kind
stranger I told you about?

549
00:28:54,355 --> 00:28:57,826
- Wait, that was Joel?
- Yes. And I can't tell Craig, obviously,

550
00:28:57,892 --> 00:29:00,696
because he's not exactly
his favorite person right now.

551
00:29:00,763 --> 00:29:03,732
- This is true.
- TAYLOR: He seems so nice, too,

552
00:29:03,998 --> 00:29:06,067
and so down-to-earth.
I... (SIGHS)

553
00:29:06,301 --> 00:29:07,503
I can't believe
I fell for that story

554
00:29:07,569 --> 00:29:09,403
that he grew up
in Forest Ridge.

555
00:29:09,871 --> 00:29:12,774
That wasn't a story. Joel
and I went to school together.

556
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:15,911
- Wait, you did?
- Yeah. We did really well, too.

557
00:29:15,977 --> 00:29:17,780
Honor roll, valedictorian...

558
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,715
He never really made a big deal
out of it, though,

559
00:29:19,782 --> 00:29:21,717
so none of us really knew
how well he did

560
00:29:21,917 --> 00:29:23,986
until he got
a full ride to college.

561
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:26,754
Okay, I don't understand.
How did he get the money

562
00:29:26,822 --> 00:29:29,190
- to buy the hotel?
- After graduation, we all thought

563
00:29:29,257 --> 00:29:31,459
he'd move back to the ranch,
work with his dad,

564
00:29:31,526 --> 00:29:32,960
but he ended up
getting recruited

565
00:29:33,027 --> 00:29:37,098
- by some tech company in California.
- (SCOFFS) Another tech guy.

566
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:40,302
Yeah, so he stayed there
until his stock was vested,

567
00:29:40,369 --> 00:29:42,972
and that's how he got a startup
off the ground.

568
00:29:43,206 --> 00:29:45,040
- He has his own company?
- Yeah.

569
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,309
Helped develop a couple apps
that got a lot of attention.

570
00:29:48,777 --> 00:29:52,113
So, he seems to be doing
quite all right for himself.

571
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,115
Okay, so this is
what I don't understand.

572
00:29:54,249 --> 00:29:57,085
If he doesn't live here,
why even buy the hotel?

573
00:29:57,353 --> 00:30:01,423
I've been wondering that myself.
But I will say I'm not surprised

574
00:30:01,524 --> 00:30:03,559
- he stopped to help you the other day.
- What do you mean?

575
00:30:03,691 --> 00:30:05,661
Growing up, Joel was always
the first person

576
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,695
to lend a helping hand
to anybody who needed it,

577
00:30:08,029 --> 00:30:13,435
so maybe the hotel is his way
of giving back to the town.

578
00:30:16,171 --> 00:30:17,672
No, 'cause why make
all these changes

579
00:30:17,738 --> 00:30:21,876
- that nobody wants?
- Maybe you should ask him

580
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:26,515
- the next time you see him.
- I can't. I promised Craig I would help him,

581
00:30:26,614 --> 00:30:29,951
and I can't do that and hang out
with Joel at the same time.

582
00:30:30,352 --> 00:30:32,555
Besides, I need to focus.
I have to...

583
00:30:33,287 --> 00:30:35,524
- I have to find a job.
- Yeah, no,

to distract you. Ooh.

- until we get those permits.
- I'm not talking about permits, Son.

I'm talking
about all those people

that need to know
you're acting in good faith.

I did what I could.

There's no record of anything
historically significant

falling in love with your mother

- at our first Harvest Ball.
- Besides that, of course.

00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:38,521
See, that's what it's all about,
Joel. Things people remember.

- I'll always remember the wallpaper.
- The wallpaper?

In a hallway on the way
to the ballroom.

610
00:31:56,805 --> 00:31:59,274
I remember Hattie and I
were on our way in, we were...

611
00:31:59,373 --> 00:32:02,978
(LAUGHS) Geez.
We were just a couple of kids,

612
00:32:03,312 --> 00:32:06,582
all dressed up
for a grownup fancy ball.

613
00:32:07,382 --> 00:32:08,950
I noticed the blue
in the wallpaper

614
00:32:09,017 --> 00:32:10,719
matched the color of her eyes.

615
00:32:12,488 --> 00:32:15,423
I knew right then and there
we were gonna be dancing

on my mind lately,

how your mother and I
never missed one.

Okay, then I'm stumped.

I... I am because
up until that point,

637
00:33:16,951 --> 00:33:20,689
I didn't think we disagreed
about, well, anything.

Of course,
up until the meeting, that is.

Joel, look, when you stopped
to help me,

640

this nice small-town guy

who probably looks really cool
riding a horse.

Well, to be fair, to be fair,
if you find the right horse

643
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,038
it's hard to look bad.

644
00:33:38,573 --> 00:33:41,508
What I didn't know is that
you own your own tech company

645
00:33:41,575 --> 00:33:42,777
and you drive a flashy car

646
00:33:42,911 --> 00:33:46,314
and you can afford to buy
and refurbish old hotels.

647
00:33:46,381 --> 00:33:48,717
Okay, technically,
it's one hotel...

648
00:33:48,784 --> 00:33:52,988
- That's probably not the point.
- No, no. The point is... is...

649
00:33:53,655 --> 00:33:55,757
you weren't
what you said you were,

650
00:33:55,924 --> 00:33:58,125
and you left out
some pretty important details.

651

It's just... (SIGHS)
...the thing is,

00:34:00,761 --> 00:34:03,631
it's like anytime I tell people
what I do or about my foundation

00:34:03,731 --> 00:34:07,402
or I talk about my collection
of... of... of first editions

See? Right there.
That's what I'm talking about.

656
00:34:14,176 --> 00:34:18,180
You see? People see me
in a completely different light

657
00:34:18,245 --> 00:34:19,480
and then it... it's like

658
00:34:19,547 --> 00:34:22,316
there's this enormous elephant
in the room

659
00:34:22,417 --> 00:34:26,422
- and I have to work so hard to get around it
- Okay, Joel, wait. Stop.

660
00:34:27,656 --> 00:34:29,959
There's something
I haven't told you yet.

661
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,930
There are a lot of people
in this town

662
00:34:34,995 --> 00:34:37,399
who love that old hotel.

663
00:34:38,734 --> 00:34:39,869
You noticed?

664
00:34:40,435 --> 00:34:43,104
One of those people
happens to be my brother.

665
00:34:44,205 --> 00:34:45,408
Craig Harris.

666
00:34:49,078 --> 00:34:51,480
You... your brother's Craig.

667
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,082
Oh...

668
00:34:55,549 --> 00:34:57,051
The one I'm visiting.

669
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,855
That's why you came to town.
Okay.

670
00:35:01,556 --> 00:35:04,426
So now that I know who you are
and you know who I am,

671
00:35:04,493 --> 00:35:07,529
I think... I think
it's probably best

672
00:35:07,596 --> 00:35:09,998
if you just send me
the tow truck bill.

673
00:35:10,998 --> 00:35:12,667
Then I'm guessing you...

674
00:35:13,234 --> 00:35:15,970
wanna pass on a cup of coffee.

675
00:35:18,107 --> 00:35:19,108
I'm sorry.

676
00:35:20,209 --> 00:35:21,210
Yeah, me too.

00:35:23,212 --> 00:35:24,180
Bye.

00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,650
Bye.

679
00:35:30,551 --> 00:35:31,752
And redesign the main floor

680
00:35:31,819 --> 00:35:34,355
to accommodate new shops
and a restaurant.

681
00:35:35,056 --> 00:35:37,558
You can look at the floor plans
to see which spaces you prefer

682
00:35:37,692 --> 00:35:41,228

tell you about this part.

- JOEL: Hmm?

685
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:52,507
Uh. This way. My favorite part

686
00:35:53,841 --> 00:35:57,078
is what they call
the grand ballroom.

687
00:35:58,547 --> 00:35:59,681
Oh, uh...

688
00:35:59,948 --> 00:36:02,584
It's the decorating committee
for the ball. I told them

689
00:36:02,651 --> 00:36:04,585
it's okay to get started,
but if you need the room...

690
00:36:04,685 --> 00:36:07,689
No, please. You, um...
just go ahead.

691
00:36:07,788 --> 00:36:10,091
All right. I'll tell you what.
Um, in the meantime,

692
00:36:10,225 --> 00:36:14,062
we can, uh, go back to my office
and let them finish up

693
00:36:14,363 --> 00:36:16,297
and we'll take a look
at the plans.

694
00:36:16,665 --> 00:36:17,732
How's that sound?

00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,705

But I needed to tell you.

I'm talking about the fact
that the locals aren't crazy

00:37:29,904 --> 00:37:31,906
about this project.

still moving forward.

help me find a book.

- And I'm looking for something a little different.

than a librarian?

work here yet.

necessarily belong together,

are stacked against them.

a happy ending.

that you're standing
by your brother. I do.

763
00:39:34,129 --> 00:39:37,165
But I also think that,
if you get to know me better,

764
00:39:37,232 --> 00:39:40,235
that you can decide for yourself
the person that I really am.

why don't you just

more than anything.

the bus all the way downtown

so that he could go talk
to the head librarian

and he told him that no one
loves books as much as I do

you can do to help the town?

my dad and I, we used to work
the ranch all the time.

we would camp out overnight,

just the two of us,
under the stars,

844

and we'd talk all night.
It was so special.

845

I had a magic wand...

- (CHUCKLES)
- ..and that I could wave it.

847

wave a magic wand and make
Forest Ridge the way it was

about him until the meeting.

told you about tonight,

if I went and talked to him,

907

he's like that.

and have dinner
with my dad and me?

991

- Dinner?
- JOEL: Yeah.

992

Come on, he's a good cook.

993
00:51:59,906 --> 00:52:01,941
And I'd love to show you
around the ranch

994
00:52:02,142 --> 00:52:03,678

- Ooh! Brr!

That wind really cuts
through you, doesn't it?

1000
00:52:18,125 --> 00:52:20,294
Oh, yeah, that's nothing.
Around here, it's not really cold

- Hi. Thank you so much

1005

- for inviting me.
- My pleasure. Um,

1006
00:52:35,776 --> 00:52:38,379
sorry to say I'm gonna have
to skip dinner, though.

stopped taking the bottle.

I gotta get out there
and see if I can

1009
00:52:42,415 --> 00:52:45,018
- get her to eat something.
- No, come on, Dad, you've been outside all day! Let me go.

to reschedule.

this could take a while.

I didn't even know
what that was,

but I knew that...
it was out there somewhere,

1040
00:54:15,709 --> 00:54:17,044
and if I wanted to find it,

1041
00:54:17,111 --> 00:54:19,113
then I had to leave
the place I love.

What you're looking for?

Well, maybe he was
just passing through.

1152
01:00:26,946 --> 01:00:30,450
But suppose he was here
on official business?

1153
01:00:31,518 --> 01:00:34,288
I think that would be a piece
of history worth saving.

1154
01:00:34,488 --> 01:00:37,658
Along with the hotel
where it happened!

1155
01:00:38,725 --> 01:00:39,893
How do we find out?

1156
01:00:40,127 --> 01:00:41,962
Well, now that we know
the timeframe,

1157
01:00:42,094 --> 01:00:43,397
we can just narrow down
the dates.

1158
01:00:43,663 --> 01:00:47,033
- Okay. Back to square one.
- TAYLOR: I think it's our best shot.

Yeah, what's going on?

01:00:56,109 --> 01:00:59,046
All right.
Yeah, no, keep me posted.

1162
01:01:00,145 --> 01:01:02,582
Okay. All right, thanks. (SIGHS)

Uh, so?

1164
01:01:04,785 --> 01:01:07,087
He caught it in time,
but we were definitely hacked.

1165
01:01:07,154 --> 01:01:08,389
Uh, let me call him.

1166
01:01:08,522 --> 01:01:10,757
I'll get on top of it. Hopefully
it's nothing too serious.

1167

- Much better, thank you for asking.

1176
01:01:46,627 --> 01:01:50,197
You know, in fact, she wanted me
to, well, invite you over

1177
01:01:50,263 --> 01:01:52,700
so she could personally
thank you for your help.

(LAUGHS) Oh. She did, did she?

1179
01:01:55,268 --> 01:01:58,404
Listen, listen,
I know that this is, well,

1180
01:01:58,504 --> 01:02:01,608

but um...

1181
01:02:02,442 --> 01:02:04,645
what do you think
if we rescheduled the dinner

1182
01:02:04,844 --> 01:02:08,281
for tonight? I promise you,
no cattle wrangling this time.

I'll see you tonight.

Thank you. That was so amazing.

Learned to cook on a campfire.

1187
01:02:21,694 --> 01:02:24,198
It's an old
Sheenan family tradition.

that's been passed down

to the next generation?

01:02:28,468 --> 01:02:30,570
Ah, it's hard to tell.
He's not much

1191
01:02:30,636 --> 01:02:32,905
on the great outdoors
these days. (CHUCKLES)

1192
01:02:32,973 --> 01:02:35,276
Yeah, that ought
to tell you something.

1193
01:02:35,908 --> 01:02:37,643
So, Joel tells me

1194
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:40,214
that you're going
to the Harvest Ball together.

1195
01:02:40,346 --> 01:02:41,881
I'm really looking
forward to it.

1196
01:02:42,448 --> 01:02:44,183
I don't know if he told you,
but that ball

1197
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:46,285
is another
Sheenan family tradition.

1198
01:02:46,852 --> 01:02:50,923
Never missed a one. Joel too,
when he was growing up.

1199
01:02:51,424 --> 01:02:52,726
You should've seen
the little tyke

1200
01:02:52,826 --> 01:02:54,628
in a suit and tie. (CHUCKLES)

1201
01:02:54,761 --> 01:02:57,730
Man, I think I got pictures
around here somewhere.

1202
01:02:57,797 --> 01:03:00,566
No. No, you don't... She
doesn't wanna see any photos.

1203
01:03:00,634 --> 01:03:03,137
- No, I sure do. (CHUCKLES)
- JOEL: Maybe later.

1204
01:03:04,004 --> 01:03:06,073
Little fella was so shy,

1205
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:08,241
he couldn't get up the courage
to ask a girl to dance,

1206
01:03:08,341 --> 01:03:09,976
so he would ask his mom.

1207
01:03:10,109 --> 01:03:12,878
- Oh, God, here we go...
- Which is how he learned to move around the floor

1208
01:03:12,946 --> 01:03:14,882
- so well.
- That's so sweet.

1209
01:03:14,982 --> 01:03:18,919
Of course, he hasn't been back
to the ball since, uh, when?

1210
01:03:19,352 --> 01:03:23,055
- Since you went off to college?
- Uh... Yeah.

1211
01:03:23,489 --> 01:03:28,361
Guess he just hasn't met anybody
he wanted to take... until now.

1212
01:03:29,696 --> 01:03:32,431
- That's very subtle, Dad. That's very subtle.
- Hmm.

Which one is your mom?

1215
01:03:37,136 --> 01:03:39,939
Uh, right there in the middle.

1216
01:03:40,506 --> 01:03:43,910
- She's beautiful.
- Never more beautiful than at the Harvest Ball.

- JOEL'S DAD: Yeah.

- Where was that taken?
- Right here.

1222
01:03:58,757 --> 01:04:00,893
You know, he built that cabin
back before Montana

1223
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,529
was even a state.

1224
01:04:02,596 --> 01:04:04,765
He cleared the land
for the ranch...

1225
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:07,834
- got married, had a family.
- JOEL'S DAD: Hmm.

has been here ever since.

about him travelling
to Forest Ridge.

I mean, he was the president.

1234

Shouldn't there be
some sort of record?

1235
01:04:34,027 --> 01:04:36,163
Maybe they didn't know
he was here.

1236
01:04:36,663 --> 01:04:38,666
Right. Teddy Roosevelt
just happened to slip

1237

under the radar and come
to Forest Ridge, Montana.

to the bottom of this, you can.

What?

1243
01:04:59,185 --> 01:05:00,986
TAYLOR: There's two feet of snow
on the ground.

1244
01:05:01,053 --> 01:05:02,321
It must have been freezing,

1245
01:05:02,422 --> 01:05:04,958
and no one's wearing a coat,
not even Roosevelt.

1246
01:05:05,325 --> 01:05:07,192
Huh! Yeah, you're right.

1247
01:05:07,259 --> 01:05:09,595
When I saw the snow,
I assumed it was winter,

1248
01:05:09,995 --> 01:05:12,765
- but look at the trees.
- They're covered with leaves.

1249
01:05:12,866 --> 01:05:15,634
Exactly. So it must have been
taken in the spring.

1250
01:05:15,701 --> 01:05:17,736
That happens sometimes.
We get a freak snowstorm

1251
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:20,873
- that time of year.
- So maybe Roosevelt didn't know that

1252
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:22,542
and he wasn't expecting snow.

1253
01:05:23,475 --> 01:05:24,977
But still,
there must have been a reason

1254
01:05:25,078 --> 01:05:26,379
he was in Montana at that time.

1255
01:05:26,546 --> 01:05:28,614
- So, how do we find that out?
- TAYLOR: So, my girlfriend Caitlin,

1256
01:05:28,747 --> 01:05:30,783
she works
at the National Archives in DC.

1257
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:32,818
So I emailed her the photo
and she said she was going

1258
01:05:32,919 --> 01:05:35,221
to search the records
to see all the travelling

1259
01:05:35,321 --> 01:05:36,756
that the President did
during that time.

1260
01:05:36,823 --> 01:05:38,892
Can she find out before
the town council meet?

1261
01:05:38,959 --> 01:05:40,794
Fingers crossed. She said
she would get back to me

1262
01:05:41,027 --> 01:05:43,897
as soon as possible.
But I think it's looking good.

In the meantime, instead of
just sitting around and waiting,

1264

I figured I would
come help decorate.

- What can I do?
- Yeah, uh, can you help bring in the rest of the centerpieces

get approved,

that I'm not going
to the ball with you.

I knew how you felt about him.

that hoped that whatever it is

would be who he was.

- PHYLLIS: Can you please...

1382
01:13:05,971 --> 01:13:09,876

that the Graff Hotel deserves
to be a historic landmark.

1405
01:14:29,188 --> 01:14:31,291
PHYLLIS: Teddy Roosevelt
was in Forest Ridge?

1406
01:14:31,657 --> 01:14:35,894
Mm-hmm. That spring, he was
at Yellowstone National Park

1407
01:14:35,961 --> 01:14:38,897
to lay the cornerstone
of the Roosevelt Arches,

1408
01:14:39,064 --> 01:14:41,367
which still stand
at the North entrance today.

1409
01:14:41,701 --> 01:14:43,836
Teddy loved this part
of the West

1410
01:14:43,903 --> 01:14:46,106
more than anything,
so he decided to stay

1411
01:14:46,171 --> 01:14:48,474
and do
a little bit more exploring.

1412
01:14:49,608 --> 01:14:51,577
What nobody was expecting

1413
01:14:52,144 --> 01:14:56,081
was that it was going to be
the coldest spring on record.

1414
01:14:56,482 --> 01:14:58,317
A freak snowstorm rolled in,

1415
01:14:58,617 --> 01:15:02,888
leaving three feet of snow,
and Teddy and his entire crew

1416
01:15:02,956 --> 01:15:05,224
stranded
just outside Forest Ridge.

1417
01:15:05,424 --> 01:15:08,426
By the time that the party
made it back into town,

1418
01:15:08,827 --> 01:15:10,330
they spent three nights

1419
01:15:10,397 --> 01:15:12,864
at the Graff Hotel
until the roads were clear.

1420
01:15:13,099 --> 01:15:16,269
- And you have proof of all this?
- I... I do, actually.

1421
01:15:19,973 --> 01:15:24,711
Right here, I have a diary entry
from Roosevelt.

1422
01:15:24,777 --> 01:15:26,813
He kept one most of his life,

1423
01:15:26,879 --> 01:15:30,116
and in April 1903, he wrote...

1424
01:15:30,649 --> 01:15:34,687
"Snowed in at a little scrappy
town called Forest Ridge."

1425
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,689
"Stayed at the Graff Hotel."

1426
01:15:36,788 --> 01:15:39,492
"Best three nights of sleep
in years."

1427
01:15:39,626 --> 01:15:44,030
But it wasn't just the Graff
that inspired him.

1428
01:15:45,564 --> 01:15:48,267
It was... Forest Ridge.

1429
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,336
It was Montana. It was...

1430
01:15:51,537 --> 01:15:53,840
this entire part of the country

1431
01:15:53,939 --> 01:15:57,242
and its people and the culture
that inspired him

1432
01:15:57,343 --> 01:16:00,313
while he was snowed in.
So, shortly after he went back

1433
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:03,583
to Washington,
he decided to sign

1434
01:16:04,384 --> 01:16:05,785
the Antiquities Act,

1435
01:16:05,984 --> 01:16:08,353
which gave him
and all of the future presidents

1436
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:12,658
the power to preserve
the beautiful country of ours

1437
01:16:12,892 --> 01:16:14,227
so that future generations

1438
01:16:14,327 --> 01:16:16,930
could enjoy
everything that he had.

about Mary Catherine,

it's kinda part
of our history too.

Hmm.

1486
01:19:10,301 --> 01:19:11,670
Harvest Ball's tonight.

1487
01:19:11,770 --> 01:19:14,773
You don't think you could hold
off leaving for one more day?

No, Dad, I can't, I ju...

at the ball.

01:19:34,059 --> 01:19:35,260
Truth is, um...

1493
01:19:37,330 --> 01:19:39,099
I made up my mind to go.

1494
01:19:41,433 --> 01:19:43,469
As a remembrance to your mother.

1495
01:19:44,237 --> 01:19:47,640
But it... it'd be my first one
without her and...

1496
01:19:48,474 --> 01:19:50,477
kinda hoping you'd be there...

1497
01:19:51,877 --> 01:19:53,645
to help get me through it.

1498
01:19:58,584 --> 01:19:59,652
Okay.

1499
01:20:02,287 --> 01:20:03,890
I'll stay, Dad. (CHUCKLES)

- Sitter's here.
- Okay, great. I am almost ready. Oh, hey, guess what?

1504
01:20:24,243 --> 01:20:27,912
The library in Seattle called
and they want me back.

1505

I just... after everything
you did for the town,

1509
01:20:37,090 --> 01:20:38,224
I thought you'd want
to hang around.

1510
01:20:38,457 --> 01:20:41,661
Yeah, I mean, you were so right
about Forest Ridge.

1511
01:20:41,727 --> 01:20:45,598
This place is really special,
and I love it, but, uh...

1512
01:20:46,232 --> 01:20:50,336
- I can't. I gotta get back.
- Fair enough. Then let's make this Harvest Ball

1513
01:20:50,469 --> 01:20:52,104
one that we'll never forget.

1514

- Perfect. Look at that.

1515

I recognized her name

from the marriage certificate,

1582
01:24:43,935 --> 01:24:47,339

what it was like for them

starting out together,
