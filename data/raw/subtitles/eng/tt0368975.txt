1
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:16,251
l can't believe you're moving.
Where is Vancouver, anyway?

2
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:20,027
Do you know what happens to girls who
start high school with no best friend,

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,194
no guy, and low social standing?

4
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,103
Nothing.
Nothing ever happens to them.

5
00:00:27,107 --> 00:00:30,565
But look at it this way--you have
the whole summer to revise your image.

6
00:00:30,644 --> 00:00:33,374
l never truly had an image, did l?

7
00:00:33,447 --> 00:00:34,880
Start now.

8
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:50,819
Bye!

9
00:00:50,897 --> 00:00:52,091
See you, guys!

10
00:00:53,867 --> 00:00:57,997
Julie, Hannah, hold on.
Take this. Here. There you go.

11
00:00:58,071 --> 00:01:00,665
What's this? l thought we were
done with junior high.

12
00:01:00,741 --> 00:01:03,335
lt's the summer reading list.

13
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,173
You read all these books?

14
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:06,507
Yeah, many times.

15
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,640
Really, Mr. Corrado,
you need to get out more.

16
00:01:10,517 --> 00:01:12,212
Okay, that's not funny!

17
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,184
You two, slow down!

18
00:01:14,254 --> 00:01:16,620
Julie, party problem.

19
00:01:17,124 --> 00:01:20,287
Great. Staci's gonna go
to Liz's sleepover.

20
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:23,696
Speak of the devils.

21
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:28,230
Hey, Yancy,
my father's a lawyer.

22
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:31,793
He could help you sue the diet pill
company for nonperformance.

23
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:40,810
Do you want to come
to my sleepover?

24
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:43,543
Me? Yeah, sure.
Absolutely.

25
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,619
- lt's tonight. Seven-ish.
- Cool.

26
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:57,219
Last chance to see
a picture of me in a coma.

27
00:01:57,297 --> 00:01:59,162
l've got tubes in nasty places.

28
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:01,462
You were barely in a coma.

29
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:03,366
Three hours.

30
00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:08,398
Hey, hey, what's this?
Someone having a par-tay tonight?

31
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:10,739
Par-tay, Jules!

32
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:14,247
Keep it up, SpongeBob. You'll have
two pictures of yourself in a coma.

33
00:02:22,055 --> 00:02:26,185
Jules, l can't make your overnighter.
l'm doing the dance.

34
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:27,817
The dance?

35
00:02:27,894 --> 00:02:29,794
The high school dance?

36
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,691
Oh, right. Have fun.

37
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:36,758
''Have fun''!

38
00:02:37,838 --> 00:02:40,363
How did Staci get so popular, anyways?

39
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,237
We used to be best friends.

40
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:44,243
That was elementary school.

41
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:45,300
True.

42
00:02:45,378 --> 00:02:49,075
So, l think l have a solution.

43
00:02:49,182 --> 00:02:50,615
l'll just move with you.

44
00:02:50,684 --> 00:02:53,778
You have to stay put, kiddo,
hold up the tent.

45
00:02:55,655 --> 00:02:57,316
The tent won't be
the same without you.

46
00:02:59,025 --> 00:03:01,289
So this is our future?

47
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:02,953
Your future.

48
00:03:03,029 --> 00:03:04,690
l still can't believe you're moving.

49
00:03:04,764 --> 00:03:07,460
How am l supposed to
do high school without you?

50
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,894
There it is--

51
00:03:11,972 --> 00:03:14,031
the high school lunch spot.

52
00:03:14,107 --> 00:03:16,507
And there's
where l'll be sitting.

53
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:19,342
Cool...

54
00:03:20,914 --> 00:03:22,472
uncool.

55
00:03:24,017 --> 00:03:25,507
Staci and Liz...

56
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:27,277
me.

57
00:03:27,387 --> 00:03:30,049
Life is so predictable it kills me.

58
00:03:47,607 --> 00:03:50,735
Steve is so plush.

59
00:03:56,983 --> 00:04:01,352
lsn't it great?
He can't see me, not at all.

60
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:20,865
l thought you'd never get home.

61
00:04:20,941 --> 00:04:23,603
We have a million things to do
before the party, Julie,

62
00:04:23,677 --> 00:04:28,239
so l stopped on my way home
and l bought all the stuff.

63
00:04:28,348 --> 00:04:30,680
Stuff? What stuff?

64
00:04:31,885 --> 00:04:34,649
Oh, Mom, not the Party Playhouse!

65
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:38,953
We are having a ladybug party.

66
00:04:39,626 --> 00:04:41,491
We've got ladybug cups...

67
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:44,121
ladybug plates...

68
00:04:44,698 --> 00:04:48,259
and a ladybug piÃ±ata.

69
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:50,929
Mom, l'm 1 4, not 4.

70
00:04:51,004 --> 00:04:54,167
l just thought your party should
have a theme, like they used to.

71
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,902
Aren't these antenna boppers
just a hoot, Hannah?

72
00:04:56,977 --> 00:04:57,966
Look.

73
00:05:02,015 --> 00:05:03,812
Someone stole my bike.

74
00:05:04,985 --> 00:05:06,452
What happened to his car?

75
00:05:06,553 --> 00:05:07,520
Repossessed.

76
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:09,851
We're all so proud.

77
00:05:09,923 --> 00:05:12,255
Maybe l should stay home tonight.

78
00:05:12,325 --> 00:05:14,418
No. Bad, Mom. You can't.

79
00:05:14,494 --> 00:05:15,552
And why not?

80
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:18,189
Because we don't need
a babysitter.

81
00:05:18,264 --> 00:05:21,597
Besides, Dad'll be here.
He's a great enforcer.

82
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:23,499
Slumber house rules.

83
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,471
Oh, for the love of carbs,
do we have to--

84
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:28,006
Slumber house rules.

85
00:05:28,074 --> 00:05:29,371
''No leaving the house,

86
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:32,969
no boys,
no damaging important stuff.''

87
00:05:33,046 --> 00:05:35,378
lf there's any structural damage
to this house...

88
00:05:35,482 --> 00:05:37,473
So, is this the part
where you break into song?

89
00:05:37,584 --> 00:05:39,051
Honey, you ignore the house rules,

90
00:05:39,152 --> 00:05:41,120
you will stay home with your grandma
and help her sort wigs

91
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:44,019
while the rest of us go to Hawaii...
without you.

92
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,523
Are you serious?

93
00:05:45,592 --> 00:05:50,188
You would take that
and leave me?

94
00:05:50,263 --> 00:05:51,696
That, who is supposed to be at college

95
00:05:51,765 --> 00:05:54,461
setting a good example
for his younger sister?

96
00:05:55,535 --> 00:05:58,698
Yeah, well, college...

97
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:02,241
Everyone was so serious.

98
00:06:02,308 --> 00:06:05,175
High school was great.

99
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:07,042
Stay as long as you can.

100
00:06:08,515 --> 00:06:12,246
Please...please tell me
we have different fathers!

101
00:06:12,352 --> 00:06:14,252
Julie, enough.
Go to your room.

102
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,652
Ren, go to your former room.

103
00:06:16,723 --> 00:06:18,691
And you, outside.

104
00:06:21,194 --> 00:06:24,061
My mom is so blindfolded.

105
00:06:25,465 --> 00:06:28,298
Look at what she bought me.

106
00:06:28,368 --> 00:06:30,268
Now, those are hot.

107
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:32,930
She seriously thinks
l'm, like, 10 or something.

108
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:37,467
Can l borrow five bucks?

109
00:06:37,544 --> 00:06:40,240
- Can you knock?
- Actually, l need 20.

110
00:06:40,313 --> 00:06:42,611
Can l borrow 50 bucks?

111
00:06:42,716 --> 00:06:45,685
Get a job.
Or better, go back to school!

112
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,556
l am blooming!
l need a lock on my door!

113
00:06:56,529 --> 00:06:58,724
Hey. What's going on?

114
00:06:58,798 --> 00:07:00,356
Fried Twinkies.

115
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:03,933
l wish l'd invented these. Wow.

116
00:07:04,003 --> 00:07:06,972
Honey, l feel so guilty leaving you
alone with the party tonight.

117
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,371
Are you sure this is okay?

118
00:07:08,441 --> 00:07:11,103
Have fun, and while
you're gone, my love...

119
00:07:12,178 --> 00:07:14,408
l'm installing
the Aquapure system.

120
00:07:14,514 --> 00:07:17,381
Oh, honey, why don't you just
relax tonight? Our water's fine.

121
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,851
Fine? Fine?
Let's just take a look at our water.

122
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,784
Blue! Blue, okay?

123
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,521
Know what that means?

124
00:07:28,595 --> 00:07:30,529
Our house is having a boy?

125
00:07:30,597 --> 00:07:32,428
l'll tell you what,

126
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:34,490
l don't know what it means,
but l'm gonna find out,

127
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:37,263
and l know it's not good,
it's not good for any of us.

128
00:07:38,671 --> 00:07:40,764
Okey-dokey. Well.

129
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,364
l'm going now.

130
00:07:43,943 --> 00:07:45,410
Behave.

131
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:46,536
Right.

132
00:07:47,614 --> 00:07:49,309
Go! Be merry!
Have fun, okay?

133
00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:50,746
All right.
Now, have a good time.

134
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,317
And keep the music down, okay?

135
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:55,478
l'm finally back on speaking terms
with the Mulligans, okay?

136
00:07:55,588 --> 00:07:56,555
Mom, go.

137
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:02,887
What do you think
they do for fun?

138
00:08:02,962 --> 00:08:05,294
My mother doesn't do fun.

139
00:08:09,602 --> 00:08:12,093
Butt crack alert.

140
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:14,162
Party!

141
00:09:22,475 --> 00:09:24,375
You're wearing that to the dance?

142
00:09:24,444 --> 00:09:25,911
We're skipping the dance.

143
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,675
Skipping the dance?

144
00:09:38,057 --> 00:09:40,821
This is where we're going
instead of the dance?

145
00:09:41,828 --> 00:09:44,353
l spent all month
getting ready for this dance.

146
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,863
That's pathetic.

147
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:48,094
Come here.

148
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:49,395
Stop it!

149
00:09:49,469 --> 00:09:51,699
You're crushing my Lulu Guinness.

150
00:09:51,771 --> 00:09:53,762
Maybe l should have
asked her out.

151
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,705
Come on.

152
00:09:57,043 --> 00:10:00,035
You promised. You promised when
you graduated, we would hook up.

153
00:10:00,113 --> 00:10:03,378
And you promised
to take me to the dance.

154
00:10:03,483 --> 00:10:05,644
Get off me!

155
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:06,719
Out!

156
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:08,878
- What?
- Get out. We're over.

157
00:10:09,989 --> 00:10:11,251
Really?

158
00:10:11,324 --> 00:10:14,225
Yeah, really.
Have you forgotten who l am?

159
00:10:14,294 --> 00:10:15,989
Let me think.

160
00:10:16,062 --> 00:10:19,589
The second-string quarterback...
on the junior varsity.

161
00:10:24,103 --> 00:10:26,401
You'll be so ruined in high school.

162
00:10:47,327 --> 00:10:50,956
Liz? Change in plan.
l can't get you guys into the dance.

163
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:55,395
Calm yourself.
l have new funness in mind.

164
00:10:55,468 --> 00:10:57,129
Start making a list.

165
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:28,927
Hi, two large pepperoni,

166
00:11:29,002 --> 00:11:31,869
two with pineapple and barbecue,
and one with...

167
00:11:31,938 --> 00:11:34,702
- Anchovies!
- That is so rank!

168
00:11:34,774 --> 00:11:36,537
The dead little stinky fish.

169
00:11:36,609 --> 00:11:37,940
Okay, thanks.

170
00:11:38,945 --> 00:11:40,936
lt better not be SpongeBob.

171
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:55,391
So...who's responsible
for all the sound?

172
00:11:55,461 --> 00:11:57,588
You're not our usual Rent-a-Cop.

173
00:11:57,663 --> 00:11:59,824
Chuck had a breakdown.
Chuck was weak.

174
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:01,457
This whole--

175
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,634
This whole ZlP code is now my domain,
and l am hip to you, little missy.

176
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,905
Got a call about excessive noise.

177
00:12:13,112 --> 00:12:15,205
Keep it down.

178
00:12:16,249 --> 00:12:18,979
Hello. May l?

179
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,622
lt's a Coke.

180
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:36,361
lt's a Coke.

181
00:12:36,436 --> 00:12:39,872
But you can't be too sure, 'cause
you kids are very crafty these days.

182
00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:42,464
Yeah, yuck. l'm gonna be
watching you, little yuck.

183
00:12:45,111 --> 00:12:48,547
- What's with this guy?
- Let me get it this time.

184
00:12:52,485 --> 00:12:53,850
What are you doing here?

185
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,252
Todd and l hooked up.
so we decided to skip the dance.

186
00:12:56,322 --> 00:12:58,790
Okay, you guys
have done the makeovers,

187
00:12:58,891 --> 00:13:02,554
the website vandalism,
and the frozen bra, right?

188
00:13:02,628 --> 00:13:03,822
Um...yeah.

189
00:13:03,896 --> 00:13:06,057
So, let's get this gala started.

190
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:10,600
Yeah. Send it.

191
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,934
Question. What's going on?

192
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:14,973
That was Liz.
She's having a party, too.

193
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,030
We heard.

194
00:13:16,109 --> 00:13:18,873
So we decided to
put together a little hunt.

195
00:13:18,945 --> 00:13:20,537
Who are you?

196
00:13:20,613 --> 00:13:21,978
Yancy.

197
00:13:22,081 --> 00:13:25,573
l'm Yancy. We had
P.E. together all year.

198
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:27,653
You're orange.

199
00:13:27,753 --> 00:13:30,415
Oh, my God, Yancy,
you are orange.

200
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,720
You used too much Presto Tan.

201
00:13:36,062 --> 00:13:38,792
Steve Phillips? Dream on.

202
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:41,261
Turn on your web cam.

203
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:45,029
We just gave each other
thongs with our names on them.

204
00:13:46,672 --> 00:13:48,162
Wicked. One for me?

205
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:49,799
But of course.

206
00:13:51,744 --> 00:13:53,644
- Hey, Julie, did Mom leave?
- Get out!

207
00:13:53,713 --> 00:13:55,840
- l only found Dad.
- Go!

208
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:58,382
My kingdom for a lock!

209
00:14:00,753 --> 00:14:02,186
Did you get the hunt list?

210
00:14:02,255 --> 00:14:03,244
Opening now.

211
00:14:03,356 --> 00:14:05,620
Hunt? Hunting what?

212
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:08,456
Scavenger hunting.

213
00:14:08,528 --> 00:14:11,361
Oh, see, we're not allowed
to leave the hou--

214
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,831
You have one of those
Polaroid sticker cameras, right?

215
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:16,300
But of course.

216
00:14:16,369 --> 00:14:18,860
Use it to document the tasks.

217
00:14:18,938 --> 00:14:20,462
Here's the list.

218
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,064
We start at 8:00, sharp as nails.

219
00:14:22,141 --> 00:14:25,599
We sketched in something
extra special for Jules.

220
00:14:25,678 --> 00:14:28,078
Special? What special?

221
00:14:28,147 --> 00:14:31,344
''Dress a window mannequin
at Old Navy in your own clothes.

222
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:35,386
''Have a guy from datesafe.com
buy you a drink at the Cosmo Club.

223
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:38,252
''Get a security decal
off a PatrolTec car,

224
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:40,189
and...''

225
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:43,456
''Borrow a pair
of Steve Phillips' boxer shorts''?

226
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:45,429
- No, no, no, no.
- What's in it for us?

227
00:14:45,498 --> 00:14:46,988
Thongs.

228
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:49,466
- Pass.
- Double pass.

229
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:51,196
- Unless...
- Hannah.

230
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,204
...we make it interesting.

231
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:54,569
Speak it.

232
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,902
Lunch spot.

233
00:14:55,975 --> 00:14:58,876
Winning group
eats at the fountain next year,

234
00:14:58,945 --> 00:15:01,641
and losers eat at the Dumpsters.

235
00:15:01,714 --> 00:15:03,705
No prob.

236
00:15:03,816 --> 00:15:05,784
Hannah, can l
talk to you for a second?

237
00:15:12,024 --> 00:15:14,549
l cannot do the things on that list.

238
00:15:14,627 --> 00:15:16,117
l'll just eat Wonder Bread
by the Dumpsters

239
00:15:16,195 --> 00:15:17,492
with the rest of the frumps.

240
00:15:17,563 --> 00:15:19,053
Julie, focus.

241
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:21,895
What do you want
more than anything in this world?

242
00:15:22,969 --> 00:15:24,698
Anything anything?

243
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,432
Ultimate anything.

244
00:15:28,507 --> 00:15:30,839
- Steve.
- Exactly.

245
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,935
Do you think
he eats by the Dumpsters?

246
00:15:33,012 --> 00:15:36,038
You could be sitting
right next to him at the fountain.

247
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:39,675
And plus, if you don't do this,
everyone's gonna hear about it.

248
00:15:39,785 --> 00:15:41,616
We live in a suck universe

249
00:15:41,687 --> 00:15:44,383
where wearing the wrong sneakers
can make us life outcasts.

250
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:45,651
l know, but--

251
00:15:45,725 --> 00:15:48,717
You and l both know that we're
not just talking about a lunch spot.

252
00:15:48,794 --> 00:15:51,957
We're talking about
who you're going to be in high school.

253
00:15:52,031 --> 00:15:53,623
You have to do this.

254
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:57,859
l hate it when you sound right.

255
00:15:57,937 --> 00:16:01,771
Only, we can't leave the house.
My mom will cancel Hawaii, and--

256
00:16:03,676 --> 00:16:04,904
Follow.

257
00:16:10,116 --> 00:16:12,380
What happened to your room?

258
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:15,079
Oh, is it different?
l hadn't noticed.

259
00:16:15,187 --> 00:16:16,654
Mom redid it.

260
00:16:16,756 --> 00:16:19,088
They weren't expecting him back so soon.

261
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:21,148
What's that?

262
00:16:21,227 --> 00:16:22,751
Oh, that?

263
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:27,561
That is where my Miss Hawaiian Tropic
standee once stood.

264
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:30,227
Now...a yoga zone.

265
00:16:30,303 --> 00:16:34,296
And have you seen
the new craft corner?

266
00:16:35,975 --> 00:16:37,499
l had a dream about these.

267
00:16:38,577 --> 00:16:40,340
They were trying to kill me.

268
00:16:41,347 --> 00:16:43,144
My glory days have been erased.

269
00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:47,345
My beer cap collection,
my cheerleader hate mail...

270
00:16:51,424 --> 00:16:52,891
l think l have a fever.

271
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,449
Getting back to the real world...

272
00:16:55,528 --> 00:16:57,291
...we have a proposition.

273
00:16:58,364 --> 00:17:00,229
lt involves money.

274
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:01,323
My money.

275
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,632
''Your money'' is my favorite word.

276
00:17:08,641 --> 00:17:11,576
l had to promise Ren fifty
of my Hot Dog on a Stick dollars

277
00:17:11,644 --> 00:17:12,838
to cover for us.

278
00:17:12,912 --> 00:17:15,073
She's getting us
a neato date for tonight.

279
00:17:15,147 --> 00:17:16,375
''Neato''?

280
00:17:16,482 --> 00:17:18,382
Pull yourself into the century.

281
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:19,884
ls this a good idea?

282
00:17:19,952 --> 00:17:21,385
This site is totally safe.

283
00:17:22,388 --> 00:17:24,515
Okay, what should our name be?

284
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,485

285
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,857

Swimsuit model.

289

Sewing.

292
00:17:40,272 --> 00:17:41,830
Eating cheese.

293
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,206
Kidding.

294
00:17:44,276 --> 00:17:45,903
Sitting...

295
00:17:45,978 --> 00:17:47,468
on the beach.

296
00:17:47,546 --> 00:17:49,810
''l'm looking for someone

298
00:17:52,017 --> 00:17:54,850
Wait. We have to get

And l'll be wearing
a paisley scarf.

300
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:02,391
How exactly are you going to be
a tall, brunette swimsuit model?

301
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:04,395
l'm not. You are.

302
00:18:04,463 --> 00:18:05,623

303
00:18:05,698 --> 00:18:07,063
Yes, you.

- Me?
- ls she broken?

305
00:18:09,735 --> 00:18:11,430
She's fine.

The 'net rocks.
We have a winner.

307
00:18:13,939 --> 00:18:15,065

308
00:18:15,141 --> 00:18:16,631
''Dave. Handsome. Ooh.

He's perfect.

Perfect? How is he perfect?

312
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:26,976
He'll be wearing a brown jacket
with a red tie.

313
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:29,350
What does the blue ribbon mean?

314
00:18:29,422 --> 00:18:30,912
lt means he's been
verified by the site.

315
00:18:31,023 --> 00:18:31,990
He's okay.

316
00:18:32,091 --> 00:18:34,559
And plus we'll all be
sticking together, right?

317
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:35,855

00:18:49,775 --> 00:18:53,108
You didn't for serious think l was

326
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:55,147
First team to complete all the tasks

00:18:55,214 --> 00:18:57,079

332
00:19:07,827 --> 00:19:09,260
Pleathers.

333
00:19:09,328 --> 00:19:11,091
Posers.

334
00:19:25,878 --> 00:19:28,312
Hey, how come Liz can drive?

335
00:19:28,414 --> 00:19:29,972
She already has her learner's permit.

336
00:19:30,082 --> 00:19:32,050
She was held back a year.

337
00:19:32,151 --> 00:19:34,619
She is so lucky.

338
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:37,648
l blame you.

339
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,691
That was excruciating.

340
00:19:51,203 --> 00:19:52,830
Let's dominate.

341
00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:08,845
l look like my mother.

342
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:10,216
Hold on.

343
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:24,731
Now...you look like
your mother 20 years ago,

344
00:20:24,803 --> 00:20:26,668
with fashion sense.

345
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:28,570
l think l can get us a car.

346
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:33,534
Speak.

347
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,884
Papa Bear is still under the sink.

348
00:20:40,953 --> 00:20:43,820
Repeat, Papa Bear
is still under the sink.

349
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:44,947
Over.

350
00:20:45,057 --> 00:20:48,322
Ren, we are still inside the house.

351
00:20:48,394 --> 00:20:51,261
Do not call unless it's an emergency.

352
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,423
10-4. Over and out.

353
00:20:58,671 --> 00:21:00,502
Do you guys think
we should be doing this?

354
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:03,830
Let's go.

355
00:21:49,955 --> 00:21:51,422
l'm pretty stuck.

356
00:21:51,523 --> 00:21:52,512
Pull.

357
00:22:03,168 --> 00:22:05,500
Look at my dad.

358
00:22:05,571 --> 00:22:07,971
He is so oblivious.

359
00:22:09,842 --> 00:22:11,742
Help.

360
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,719
- Great rescue, guys.
- Sorry.

361
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:22,184
Come on.

362
00:22:30,095 --> 00:22:32,063
Destination Hottie House in sight.

363
00:22:35,934 --> 00:22:37,060
l'm okay.

364
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,648
Officially, the smallest car
l've ever seen.

365
00:22:54,687 --> 00:22:56,552
lt looks like a clown car.

366
00:22:56,622 --> 00:22:58,089
lt's an electric car.

367
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,216
lt's made out of this really hard
recycled stuff.

368
00:23:01,293 --> 00:23:04,285
My dad taught me how to drive it
in the mall parking lot,

369
00:23:04,363 --> 00:23:06,388
said l could use it for an emergency,

370
00:23:06,465 --> 00:23:10,333
which it kinda seems like this is.

371
00:23:19,611 --> 00:23:21,306
That's my hand!

372
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,507
No, sadly, that's my hand.

373
00:23:39,932 --> 00:23:43,095
Fake food's come a long way
in the last ten years.

374
00:23:53,612 --> 00:23:54,943
Wrong room.

375
00:24:03,689 --> 00:24:05,657
All l can find are these scrunchies.

376
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:07,385
Yeah, and socks.

377
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:10,587
Cha-ching! l found bras!

378
00:24:11,363 --> 00:24:12,455
Yeah!

379
00:24:12,531 --> 00:24:17,195
Dude, clue. Don't you think
there's something missing?

380
00:24:19,605 --> 00:24:21,197
What?

381
00:24:21,273 --> 00:24:23,434
The girls!

382
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:27,445
Right, right.
Where are the babes?

383
00:24:27,513 --> 00:24:28,707
Gone.

384
00:24:28,781 --> 00:24:30,305
Gone?

385
00:24:30,415 --> 00:24:32,178
This diary raid skeaves!

386
00:24:34,553 --> 00:24:36,783
Girls! Everything all right up there?

387
00:25:16,061 --> 00:25:18,621
lf you tell anyone about this...

388
00:25:19,698 --> 00:25:21,427
l will so injure you.

389
00:25:28,874 --> 00:25:32,469
Looks like we're going
on a scavenger hunt, men.

390
00:25:43,088 --> 00:25:44,851
That guy just waved at me.

391
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,628
l am so smushed, l can't even
return a wave at a cute guy.

392
00:25:52,698 --> 00:25:54,427
Cute guys never wave at me.

393
00:25:54,499 --> 00:25:57,696
Oh, what am l saying?
No guys ever wave at me.

394
00:25:57,769 --> 00:25:58,997
l'm fat.

395
00:25:59,071 --> 00:26:01,938
You are not fat. Who told you
that you were fat?

396
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,099
Uh...Staci and Liz.

397
00:26:04,142 --> 00:26:07,236
l heard they have scales
in their gym lockers.

398
00:26:07,312 --> 00:26:10,145
They do. They made me
stand on it in front of everyone.

399
00:26:10,249 --> 00:26:12,308
lt was the worst moment of my life.

400
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:13,543
That's hideous.

401
00:26:14,586 --> 00:26:17,817
Yancy, would you rather eat
celery or a brownie?

402
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,824
What is that, a trick question?

403
00:26:19,892 --> 00:26:20,859
Exactly.

404
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:24,053
So you'll just date guys
who like brownies.

405
00:26:25,631 --> 00:26:29,192
Okay. First on the list,
mannequins.

406
00:26:34,206 --> 00:26:36,037
They look so cute in your clothes.

407
00:26:36,108 --> 00:26:37,097
Smile!

408
00:26:43,348 --> 00:26:44,576
Good luck.

409
00:26:44,683 --> 00:26:46,344
Keep it.

410
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:52,482
Attertior. shoppers. Old Navy
will be closirg ir five mirutes.

411
00:26:52,557 --> 00:26:53,956
They locked it.

412
00:26:54,026 --> 00:26:55,254
Of course they did.

413
00:26:55,327 --> 00:26:57,488
There's another
display window over there.

414
00:26:57,562 --> 00:26:58,551
Let's go.

415
00:27:03,135 --> 00:27:04,261
They're guys.

416
00:27:04,336 --> 00:27:07,271
l don't think they're gonna fit
into our miniskirts.

417
00:27:07,339 --> 00:27:09,102
We have to try.

418
00:27:09,174 --> 00:27:10,163
Let's go.

419
00:27:27,225 --> 00:27:28,192
Freeze!

420
00:28:17,843 --> 00:28:22,109
Who would design this guy?
He's got thunder thighs.

421
00:28:41,566 --> 00:28:44,330
Okay, we got it. Ready?

422
00:28:44,403 --> 00:28:45,461
Smile!

423
00:28:45,537 --> 00:28:46,663
Hey!

Okay, come back in here!

427
00:29:04,222 --> 00:29:05,780
Open up this door!

428
00:29:09,394 --> 00:29:11,021
Bye!

429
00:29:11,096 --> 00:29:14,190
Oh, that is so not cool!

430
00:29:27,813 --> 00:29:29,678
All right, l'm coming.

431
00:29:29,781 --> 00:29:32,477
Okay, here you go.
Thanks, man.

432
00:29:32,584 --> 00:29:34,950
You girls better eat
all this pizza.

433
00:29:36,021 --> 00:29:38,956
l'll deliver those pies to 'em.

434
00:29:39,024 --> 00:29:41,891
You're gonna take the pizzas
up to your sister?

435
00:29:42,961 --> 00:29:45,623
Dad, you have
Aquapure momentum.

436
00:29:45,697 --> 00:29:47,528
Don't stop now.

437
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:50,864
l do. Yeah. All right.

438
00:29:50,936 --> 00:29:53,097
As a matter of fact, you're gonna be
the first one to taste the new water.

439
00:29:53,171 --> 00:29:54,195
Let's go. Come on.

440
00:29:57,809 --> 00:29:59,470
- Oh, my gosh.

441
00:29:59,544 --> 00:30:00,533
The pizzas!

442
00:30:02,147 --> 00:30:03,614
So you're done?

443
00:30:03,715 --> 00:30:05,410
One more adjustment and l will be.

444
00:30:05,517 --> 00:30:06,484
All right.

445
00:30:09,187 --> 00:30:10,950
Yeah?

446
00:30:11,022 --> 00:30:12,455
Did the pizzas come?

447
00:30:14,226 --> 00:30:16,956
My sources say yes.

448
00:30:17,028 --> 00:30:18,859
You have to make them
all disappear.

449
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,488
What's the offer?

450
00:30:20,565 --> 00:30:22,328
- Laundry.

451
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,526

453
00:30:25,871 --> 00:30:27,600
Done.

454
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:30,800
Business deal?

455
00:30:30,876 --> 00:30:32,605
Exactly.

456
00:30:32,677 --> 00:30:33,666
Good for you.

457
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:37,648
All right, this is gonna change
the way you look at water.

458
00:30:43,655 --> 00:30:45,179
You first.

459
00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:50,093
l gotta just check the line.

460
00:30:50,162 --> 00:30:51,322
Good thought.

461
00:30:56,434 --> 00:30:57,924
There's no place to park.

462
00:30:58,003 --> 00:31:00,267
Check it--
he's letting in the pleathers.

463
00:31:00,338 --> 00:31:03,330
You guys, we're never
gonna beat them.

464
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:06,037
Okay, try parking around the corner.
We'll be quick.

465
00:31:12,918 --> 00:31:14,317
We're throwing 'em out.

466
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,584
We're not gonna eat all these...

467
00:31:17,656 --> 00:31:19,624
till we're sick...

468
00:31:20,725 --> 00:31:23,159
writhing on the floor in pain.

469
00:31:25,096 --> 00:31:26,927
Go.

470
00:31:32,737 --> 00:31:34,932
This is so good.
l'm gonna kill you.

471
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,648
We're with them,
the girls you just let in.

472
00:31:44,716 --> 00:31:46,877
Yeah, the other girls.

473
00:31:46,985 --> 00:31:48,680
What are you doing here?

474
00:31:48,787 --> 00:31:50,152
Scavenger hunting.

475
00:31:50,222 --> 00:31:51,416
Okay, no.

476
00:31:51,489 --> 00:31:54,083
All right, get gone, all of you.

477
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,320
- Hey.
- This is so not fair.

478
00:31:56,394 --> 00:31:59,761
l don't have to be fair.
l have the pretty rope.

479
00:31:59,831 --> 00:32:01,264
Now scram!

480
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:27,417
l'll bet your date's inside right now
buying Staci a drink.

481
00:32:27,492 --> 00:32:30,256
Date? You have a date?

482
00:32:58,723 --> 00:33:00,987
Oh, this rocks!

483
00:33:01,092 --> 00:33:02,855
Look!

484
00:33:02,894 --> 00:33:04,657
They're about to get their picture!

485
00:33:06,031 --> 00:33:07,623
We have to find Dave.

486
00:33:08,633 --> 00:33:10,430
Hey, is that...

487
00:33:10,502 --> 00:33:12,970
Mr. Corrado?!

488
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:16,337
Now there are no surprises
left in this world.

489
00:33:16,408 --> 00:33:18,239
Corrado goes clubbing?

490
00:33:19,711 --> 00:33:21,736
Okay, focus on finding Dave.

491
00:33:21,813 --> 00:33:24,304
Now, what exactly is he
supposed to be wearing?

492
00:33:24,382 --> 00:33:26,282
A brown jacket

493
00:33:26,351 --> 00:33:28,785
with a red tie.

494
00:33:28,853 --> 00:33:29,820
Oh, my gosh!

495
00:33:29,921 --> 00:33:33,186
You're wrong. There is
one surprise left in this world.

496
00:33:33,258 --> 00:33:35,488
- Mr. Corrado's my date!
- What?!

497
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,050
He'll report us for sure.

498
00:33:37,128 --> 00:33:38,720
Let's go.

499
00:33:38,797 --> 00:33:41,027
Excuse us, excuse us!

500
00:33:44,369 --> 00:33:45,631
June! June!

501
00:33:45,704 --> 00:33:49,333
- He's seen me!
- Your scarf--get rid of it!

502
00:33:50,408 --> 00:33:51,670
You dropped this.

503
00:33:51,743 --> 00:33:52,732
No, l didn't.

504
00:33:52,811 --> 00:33:54,176
- Yes.
- No.

505
00:33:54,245 --> 00:33:56,179
- Keep it.
- No!

506
00:33:56,247 --> 00:33:57,737
Uh...June.

507
00:33:59,984 --> 00:34:00,882
No, sorry.

508
00:34:00,985 --> 00:34:05,115
Well, you're the only one here
with a paisley scarf, so...

509
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,158
No, l'm sorry.
That's not me.

510
00:34:07,225 --> 00:34:11,025
Okay, l know l might be
a disappointment physically,

511
00:34:11,096 --> 00:34:13,291

512

Hi.

513
00:34:21,106 --> 00:34:23,233

514
00:34:24,309 --> 00:34:25,298
Sure.

515
00:34:27,946 --> 00:34:29,243
What would you like?

516
00:34:29,347 --> 00:34:30,814
A Chunky Monkey.

517
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:33,850

518
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:35,249
Oh, um...

00:34:40,825 --> 00:34:42,622
What?! Are you crazy?

520
00:34:42,694 --> 00:34:43,752
Excuse me?

521
00:34:51,436 --> 00:34:54,132
A sex on the beach. My fave.

522
00:34:54,205 --> 00:34:55,638
Oh. Two.

523
00:34:57,008 --> 00:35:01,536
So, what's it like
being a swimsuit model?

524
00:35:01,613 --> 00:35:03,706
Um...cold.

525
00:35:04,816 --> 00:35:06,807
Well, yeah.

526
00:35:09,587 --> 00:35:13,079
Have we met before?
Your laugh is so familiar.

527
00:35:13,191 --> 00:35:14,158
My laugh?

528
00:35:14,259 --> 00:35:16,420
Actually, it's not my laugh.

529
00:35:16,494 --> 00:35:20,021
You see, l'm trying out different laughs
until l find the right one.

530
00:35:20,098 --> 00:35:21,429
What do you think of this one?

531
00:35:26,938 --> 00:35:28,200
Here's your drinks.

532
00:35:28,273 --> 00:35:29,740
Can l see some l.D.?

533
00:35:29,808 --> 00:35:31,139
My l.D.?

534
00:35:31,209 --> 00:35:35,111
Oh, um, l left it in my limo.

535
00:35:36,014 --> 00:35:37,743
Sorry.

536
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:39,612
Julie.

537
00:35:47,425 --> 00:35:49,916
Hi, Mr. Corrado.

538
00:35:49,994 --> 00:35:52,155
A swimsuit model?

539
00:35:55,033 --> 00:36:00,027
This is so typical. l either
get stood up or worse...and this is worse!

540
00:36:00,104 --> 00:36:01,594
How did you ever get in here?

541
00:36:01,706 --> 00:36:04,436
lt's a long story,
but the cheat-sheet version is,

542
00:36:04,476 --> 00:36:06,944
l'm on a scavenger hunt
for a lunch spot.

543
00:36:11,049 --> 00:36:12,983
The fountain.

544
00:36:13,051 --> 00:36:15,349
How do you know about the fountain?

545
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,388
l'm not that old.

546
00:36:17,489 --> 00:36:19,320
l went to Abbott High School, too.

547
00:36:20,191 --> 00:36:22,819
Never did get to
sit at the fountain, though.

548
00:36:23,995 --> 00:36:25,963
Okay, get going.

549
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,123
Actually, could you buy me a drink?

550
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:30,360
A soda would fulfill the hunt list.

551
00:36:30,435 --> 00:36:32,335
But l have to get a picture of it.

552
00:36:32,403 --> 00:36:34,462
l should have known that
you would be nearby.

553
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:38,031
Two ginger ales for these two.

554
00:36:38,109 --> 00:36:39,542
With olives.

555
00:36:39,611 --> 00:36:40,771
lt's very cosmopolitan.

556
00:36:48,086 --> 00:36:50,714
Hey, sweet thing.
Wanna dance?

557
00:36:50,822 --> 00:36:53,950
When hell freezes over...twice.

558
00:36:56,261 --> 00:36:57,250
She likes me.

559
00:37:18,783 --> 00:37:22,082
Hey...do you want to sneak in?

560
00:37:22,153 --> 00:37:24,815
No, thanks.
l'm waiting for someone.

561
00:37:24,889 --> 00:37:26,356
Your boyfriend.

562
00:37:26,424 --> 00:37:27,789
My boyfriend?

563
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:30,054
No, l don't have a boyfriend.

564
00:37:30,128 --> 00:37:32,255
Playing hard to get?

565
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:36,130
l'm just sitting here.
l'm not playing anything.

566
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,260
Well, l gotta go to another gig.
Their speaker blew.

567
00:37:39,337 --> 00:37:41,862
That's what l do during the summer,
l move speakers.

568
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:47,901
lt's not, like, my life goal or anything,
but, you know, it's money.

569
00:37:47,979 --> 00:37:50,072
That's nice.

570
00:37:51,716 --> 00:37:53,343
Why are you talking to me?

571
00:37:53,451 --> 00:37:54,440
What do you mean?

572
00:37:54,552 --> 00:37:56,417
Well, guys never talk to me.

573
00:37:56,487 --> 00:38:01,015
l mean, sometimes they ask me to hold
the door for them, but that's about it.

574
00:38:01,092 --> 00:38:02,821
What's your name?

575
00:38:02,894 --> 00:38:04,725
- Yancy.
- Peter.

576
00:38:04,796 --> 00:38:07,697
And l would never ask you
to hold a door.

577
00:38:17,976 --> 00:38:21,673
What's with you?
Your face is all glad-looking.

578
00:38:21,746 --> 00:38:24,237
A guy--
a really cute guy--

579
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:29,514
and he talked to me like a guy
talks to a girl that he maybe might like.

580
00:38:29,621 --> 00:38:30,781
Where'd he go?

581
00:38:30,888 --> 00:38:32,617
He left.

582
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:35,784
And l'll probably never,
ever see him again.

583
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,055
This is the worst night of my life.

584
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:41,554
Your girls are drinking
with Mr. Corrado.

585
00:38:41,633 --> 00:38:43,828
- Total grode.
- Pathetic.

586
00:38:48,306 --> 00:38:49,933
Okay.

587
00:38:50,008 --> 00:38:51,976
You have to leave.
You girls shouldn't be here.

588
00:38:52,043 --> 00:38:55,069
Mr. Corrado, some female-type advice...

589
00:38:55,146 --> 00:38:57,273
Should l be afraid?

590
00:38:57,382 --> 00:38:59,316
Loosen your tie.

591
00:39:03,121 --> 00:39:04,520
Come here.

592
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:16,566
Looks good.

593
00:39:20,138 --> 00:39:21,400
Who would have guessed?

594
00:39:21,472 --> 00:39:22,962
Hi.

595
00:39:24,142 --> 00:39:25,404
Do you want to dance?

596
00:39:28,613 --> 00:39:30,672
Yeah. Sure.

597
00:39:37,188 --> 00:39:38,917
We still have a chance
at winning. Let's go.

598
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,894
l think l just had a stroke.

599
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:54,403
- What?
- Up there on that platform.

600
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:59,202
- ls that...?
- My mother!

601
00:39:59,277 --> 00:40:02,405
What is she doing?
This is like Moms Gore Wild.

602
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,439
She can't...wiggle...like that.
She's a mother.

603
00:40:06,517 --> 00:40:08,985
She uses Saran Wrap.
She makes mac and cheese.

604
00:40:09,087 --> 00:40:11,055
She drives a Volvo.

605
00:40:13,091 --> 00:40:17,790
Yeah, older babeage,
shaking her boo-tay.

606
00:40:19,864 --> 00:40:21,889
Do you think my dad
knows about this?

607
00:40:21,966 --> 00:40:24,025
Oh, this is horrible!
l mean, my mom's a...

608
00:40:25,036 --> 00:40:27,129
Who is she?

609
00:40:32,977 --> 00:40:35,707
Whoever she is,
she's headed this way. Let's go.

610
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,940
Come on.

611
00:40:37,014 --> 00:40:38,003
Was l?

612
00:40:38,116 --> 00:40:39,640
Yeah, you were just shaking!

613
00:40:39,751 --> 00:40:40,718
Yes.

614
00:40:43,187 --> 00:40:45,087
What is that?

615
00:40:45,156 --> 00:40:46,783
l think it's my scarf.

616
00:40:46,858 --> 00:40:49,292
Yeah, but you weren't wearing a scarf.

617
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,850
l know.

618
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:05,031
Gabby!
Gabby, who did you see?

619
00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:07,634
l'm not sure.

620
00:41:07,712 --> 00:41:09,612
Oh, shoot. No reception.

621
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,011
l have to make a call.

622
00:41:14,252 --> 00:41:16,812
l'm beyond dead.
She's calling Dad.

623
00:41:16,921 --> 00:41:18,047
Ren will cover.

624
00:41:18,156 --> 00:41:19,885
She's gonna want to
talk to me.

625
00:41:19,957 --> 00:41:24,417
Hello! ls anyone else concerned
that we're sitting in trash?

626
00:41:30,935 --> 00:41:34,962
Yeah, so, anyway--
oh, my God, did l tell you?

627
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:37,166
l have to get home before...

628
00:41:38,342 --> 00:41:40,902
This cannot happen.

629
00:41:42,046 --> 00:41:44,344
Really okay.

630
00:41:46,984 --> 00:41:48,713
Where to next?

631
00:42:08,172 --> 00:42:11,039
All right, so l'll see you later,
hopefully. All right. Bye.

632
00:42:25,489 --> 00:42:26,854
Okay, so l'll see you
in a few minutes?

633
00:42:26,924 --> 00:42:28,687
All right. Okay, bye-bye.

634
00:42:28,759 --> 00:42:30,886
Oh, wait. No way. Really?

635
00:42:42,607 --> 00:42:44,199
Who was that?

636
00:43:12,904 --> 00:43:15,031
Oh, come on.
Come on, come on.

637
00:43:25,082 --> 00:43:26,140
Twinkie, yeah.

638
00:43:42,667 --> 00:43:43,656
Hello?

639
00:43:43,734 --> 00:43:45,395
Hi. sweetheart.

640
00:43:45,469 --> 00:43:47,596
Are the girls there?

641
00:43:47,672 --> 00:43:49,469
They're here, of course!

642
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,734
Have you seen them?

643
00:43:50,808 --> 00:43:51,797
Yeah.

644
00:44:14,865 --> 00:44:15,854
SpongeBob.

645
00:44:17,201 --> 00:44:18,964
Where else would they be?

646
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:21,827
Yeah.

647
00:44:22,907 --> 00:44:25,239
Oh, it's all coming together.

648
00:44:25,309 --> 00:44:27,140
Where would they be?

649
00:44:27,211 --> 00:44:29,236
They're great.

650
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:35,112
Hey, hey, hey! Turn it off!

651
00:44:35,219 --> 00:44:36,652
Look, l--

652
00:44:36,721 --> 00:44:40,282
No, no, no! Turn it off!
No, turn it off!

653
00:44:40,358 --> 00:44:41,325
l didn't do it!

654
00:44:41,425 --> 00:44:42,414
Off!

655
00:44:42,493 --> 00:44:43,824
Thank you!

656
00:44:43,894 --> 00:44:46,362
Honey, it sounds like
we're being attacked.

657
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:49,524
What? Attacked? Oh, no.

658
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:55,630
No! The next-door neighbor, the hose
was going all over into our yard.

659
00:44:58,809 --> 00:45:00,902
Just bring the phone
up to Julie's room.

660
00:45:03,314 --> 00:45:04,474
Julie...

661
00:45:04,582 --> 00:45:07,050
your mom's on the phone.

662
00:45:11,188 --> 00:45:12,155
Jules?

663
00:45:15,059 --> 00:45:17,050
Yeah, Dad?

664
00:45:17,128 --> 00:45:18,959
Your mom's on the phone.

665
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:24,800
Hello?

666
00:45:24,869 --> 00:45:27,963
Hi. ls everything okay?

667
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:29,870
Yeah, Mom, everything's fine.

668
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,407
So what are you girls up to?

669
00:45:31,475 --> 00:45:32,464
Stuff.

670
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,532
What stuff?

671
00:45:33,611 --> 00:45:35,169
Just stuff, okay?

672
00:45:35,246 --> 00:45:36,873
Julie, need l remind you...?

673
00:45:36,947 --> 00:45:40,075
Mom. h krow all your rules--
ro movirg. ro smilirg.

674
00:45:40,184 --> 00:45:41,151
no breathing.

675
00:45:41,252 --> 00:45:43,516
Horey. those rules
are foryour owr good.

676
00:45:43,587 --> 00:45:45,885
You girls should be getting
to bed now, anyway.

677
00:45:45,956 --> 00:45:49,255
Bed? lt's barely 9:30.
How old do you think we are?

678
00:45:49,326 --> 00:45:50,315
Honey, why is it...?

679
00:45:50,394 --> 00:45:52,225
Why dor't you just freeze me
ir a time capsule?

680
00:45:52,296 --> 00:45:53,957
That way l stay little forever.

681
00:45:54,031 --> 00:45:56,795
Okay, l'm going now.
Behave. Goodbye.

682
00:46:05,142 --> 00:46:06,734
That was way too close.

683
00:46:07,711 --> 00:46:09,906
l'm freaking exhausted.

684
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:15,384
l need to go back to college
and get some rest.

685
00:46:16,854 --> 00:46:19,584
l don't know how to say this,
but thanks.

686
00:46:19,657 --> 00:46:22,490
And can you cover for us
for just a little longer?

687
00:46:23,794 --> 00:46:25,785
Go be a teenager.

688
00:46:27,198 --> 00:46:28,688
lt ends too soon.

689
00:46:30,201 --> 00:46:33,602
And it gets replaced
by ribbons and lampshades.

690
00:46:45,583 --> 00:46:46,880
Steve's house.

691
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:49,486
Uh-oh.

692
00:46:49,587 --> 00:46:51,782
Define ''uh-oh.''

693
00:46:51,856 --> 00:46:53,915
l think the car needs charging.

694
00:46:53,991 --> 00:46:57,324
What? We ran out of juice
in front of Steve's house?

695
00:46:57,394 --> 00:47:00,295
lt has a quick charge function.
l just need a plug.

696
00:47:00,364 --> 00:47:02,525
A plug?

697
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,999
Calm yourself.

698
00:47:04,068 --> 00:47:07,435
We'll take care of the car,
you just go get his boxers.

699
00:47:07,505 --> 00:47:10,030
Wait--why do l have to
boost his boxers?

700
00:47:10,107 --> 00:47:14,703
Are you kidding? The only reason this
is even on the list is because of you.

701
00:47:14,778 --> 00:47:17,212
She's right.
This one's all you.

702
00:47:18,649 --> 00:47:20,082
Do you think he's in there?

703
00:47:20,151 --> 00:47:22,881
lt's almost ten.
He might be at the dance by now.

704
00:47:22,987 --> 00:47:25,046
Or he might be inside getting ready.

705
00:47:25,156 --> 00:47:28,250
l mean, no one great
shows up before ten.

706
00:47:28,325 --> 00:47:29,724
Thanks for that.

707
00:47:40,037 --> 00:47:42,505
l can't do this.
Let's go home. We lose.

708
00:47:42,573 --> 00:47:44,302
You are Julie--

709
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:46,639
great knees, powerful brain.

710
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:48,541
You can do this.

711
00:47:48,612 --> 00:47:51,172
''Great knees''?
''Powerful brain''?

712
00:47:51,282 --> 00:47:53,546
ls that supposed to
make me feel better?

713
00:47:53,651 --> 00:47:55,312
What do you care anyway?

714
00:47:55,419 --> 00:47:57,216
You're moving.

715
00:47:57,288 --> 00:47:59,313
That's why l care.

716
00:47:59,423 --> 00:48:02,620
Julie, l know you can do this.

717
00:48:19,577 --> 00:48:21,909
Ugh! Serious ugh!

718
00:48:23,814 --> 00:48:24,803
Got 'em!

719
00:48:25,849 --> 00:48:27,009
Here she comes!

720
00:48:33,691 --> 00:48:34,919
She did it.

721
00:48:34,992 --> 00:48:37,392
She actually went inside.

722
00:48:37,461 --> 00:48:41,056
This is gonna be
worth the price of admission.

723
00:48:41,131 --> 00:48:43,656
PatrolTec Security, please.

724
00:48:43,734 --> 00:48:49,604
Hello, l'd like to report
a suspicious person at 947 Oak Lane.

725
00:48:49,673 --> 00:48:50,867
Thank you.

726
00:48:50,941 --> 00:48:51,930
Done.

727
00:49:11,962 --> 00:49:13,259
You think that's the girl?

728
00:49:14,331 --> 00:49:15,821
Hard to tell. lt was dark.

729
00:49:38,188 --> 00:49:40,156
A plug! l found a plug!

730
00:49:50,034 --> 00:49:51,467
Of course.

731
00:49:51,535 --> 00:49:53,799
You know, l think this is the girl,

732
00:49:53,871 --> 00:49:55,964
and l recognize her from somewhere.

733
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,770
l think l knew her
in my grade school or something.

734
00:50:02,846 --> 00:50:03,835
So?

735
00:50:03,914 --> 00:50:06,007
She grew up nice.

736
00:50:06,116 --> 00:50:08,778
Drama club, basketball,
debate team.

737
00:50:08,886 --> 00:50:13,516
Hobbies--hot dogs,
skateboarding, and napping.

738
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:15,785
Steve, what are you doing?

739
00:50:15,859 --> 00:50:18,521
There's, like, a gym full of girls
waiting for you.

740
00:50:20,764 --> 00:50:23,756
Basketball, boarding, and dogs.

741
00:50:26,203 --> 00:50:28,694
Hey, hurry up!
Dance ends at midnight!

742
00:51:09,079 --> 00:51:11,411
Okay, we can almost reach.

743
00:51:12,516 --> 00:51:14,245
Come on.

744
00:51:14,351 --> 00:51:15,784
Okay, stop!

745
00:51:16,954 --> 00:51:18,080
Stop pushing!

746
00:51:18,188 --> 00:51:19,746
We're not pushing anymore!

747
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:28,464
Oh, no!

748
00:51:32,169 --> 00:51:33,500
What the heck was that?

749
00:51:44,381 --> 00:51:45,643
Okay, here we go.

750
00:51:46,683 --> 00:51:47,775
Oh, flashlight!

751
00:51:47,885 --> 00:51:50,353
Gonna leave a mark.
There we go.

752
00:51:55,659 --> 00:51:58,651
Look, someone smacked
into the PatrolTec guy!

753
00:51:58,729 --> 00:52:01,391
- Sweet!
- l know.

754
00:52:01,498 --> 00:52:03,693
Securing the perimeter.

755
00:52:07,171 --> 00:52:09,366
There's the suspect.
Hey, you!

756
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,805
PatrolTec Security!

757
00:52:11,942 --> 00:52:13,603
All right, l've spotted you!

758
00:52:13,677 --> 00:52:16,043
Security officer on the premises!
Right here!

759
00:52:16,113 --> 00:52:18,206
And we win.

760
00:52:18,315 --> 00:52:19,714
We always win.

761
00:52:19,817 --> 00:52:21,546
ls there no one to challenge us?

762
00:52:21,652 --> 00:52:23,119
Let's scoot over to the dance.

763
00:52:23,187 --> 00:52:25,018
What's the point?

764
00:52:25,088 --> 00:52:27,352
lt's obvious they're not even
going to finish.

765
00:52:27,424 --> 00:52:29,688
Let's just go get juicers.

766
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,288
ls there a reason you don't want to
go to the dance...like a Todd reason?

767
00:52:34,364 --> 00:52:36,662
No. There's no Todd reason.

768
00:52:36,733 --> 00:52:38,166
Then what's your affliction?

769
00:52:38,235 --> 00:52:40,669
l'm sure one of my sister's friends
can get us in.

770
00:52:40,737 --> 00:52:42,398
Let's just go.

771
00:52:45,709 --> 00:52:48,041
l got a suspicious person call
at this address,

772
00:52:48,111 --> 00:52:51,137
and you look suspicious to me.

773
00:52:51,215 --> 00:52:54,844
Hey...haven't l seen you before?

774
00:52:54,952 --> 00:52:56,817
l don't think so.

775
00:52:56,887 --> 00:52:58,821
What's your name?

776
00:52:58,889 --> 00:53:00,220
Julie.

777
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:04,590
And why are you damp, Julie?

778
00:53:04,695 --> 00:53:07,391
l was surprised by some sprinklers.

779
00:53:14,238 --> 00:53:17,537
- What have we here?
- l can explain.

780
00:53:17,608 --> 00:53:19,769
l doubt it. Follow me.

781
00:53:20,944 --> 00:53:23,139
Hey, where's the tiny green car?

782
00:53:23,213 --> 00:53:24,202
What?

783
00:53:24,314 --> 00:53:26,009
The tiny car that hit me?

784
00:53:33,423 --> 00:53:35,516
Not even a dent.

785
00:53:35,592 --> 00:53:37,253
Told you this thing was tough.

786
00:53:37,327 --> 00:53:39,818
Hello! How are we
gonna salvage Julie?

787
00:53:40,931 --> 00:53:43,263
Did you guys already panty-raid
skater-boy Steve?

788
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:46,530
Yeah, but Julie got nabbed
by Joe PatrolTec.

789
00:53:48,105 --> 00:53:49,766
She needs a hero.

790
00:53:54,878 --> 00:53:57,278
Your telephone number, please.

791
00:54:03,186 --> 00:54:04,153
Hey!

792
00:54:05,188 --> 00:54:07,884
No heels on the hardwood floor, okay?

793
00:54:17,801 --> 00:54:20,599
l don't know what girls
are always whining about.

794
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,332
Heels aren't so bad.

795
00:54:26,577 --> 00:54:27,566
l'll get it!

796
00:54:30,414 --> 00:54:31,676
Yes, good evening.

797
00:54:31,782 --> 00:54:34,250
This is Officer Shiner
from PatrolTec Security.

798
00:54:34,351 --> 00:54:35,511
ls this Mr. Corky?

799
00:54:36,553 --> 00:54:40,489
Uh-huh. Well, l'm standing here
with your daughter Julie.

800
00:54:40,557 --> 00:54:41,615
That's right.

801
00:54:43,961 --> 00:54:45,121
All right.

802
00:54:45,195 --> 00:54:47,288
Your father
wants to talk to you.

803
00:54:58,942 --> 00:55:00,273
Dad?

804
00:55:00,310 --> 00:55:03,143
Fifty monthly for six months.

805
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:05,512
Um, what was that, Dad?

806
00:55:05,616 --> 00:55:09,643
You have no idea how close Dad
just came to answering this phone.

807
00:55:09,753 --> 00:55:12,381
l had to hurt myself,

808
00:55:12,456 --> 00:55:14,321
and l'm wearing red pumps.

809
00:55:14,391 --> 00:55:16,825
Fifty monthly for six months.

810
00:55:16,893 --> 00:55:18,554
No.

811
00:55:18,629 --> 00:55:20,256
No?

812
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:22,560
No. Three.

813
00:55:22,633 --> 00:55:24,498
You're negotiating row?

814
00:55:24,568 --> 00:55:26,832
That's right. l'll be home soon.

815
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:28,964
That is--

816
00:55:33,543 --> 00:55:35,443
She renegotiated and hung up.

817
00:55:35,512 --> 00:55:39,107
She's way more impressive
than l thought.

818
00:55:41,551 --> 00:55:43,018
Don't move.

819
00:55:43,086 --> 00:55:46,988
l know l've got a field
interrogation card in here somewhere.

820
00:55:47,057 --> 00:55:48,524
Julie, get in!

821
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:50,456
Hey! Tiny green car!

822
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:57,122
- What are you doing?
- Winning!

823
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,532
That's my official decal!

824
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:03,166
We've got everything!
Let's get to the high school!

825
00:56:07,978 --> 00:56:10,242
That is it. Come on.

826
00:56:10,313 --> 00:56:12,110
What is the problem? Come on.

827
00:56:21,024 --> 00:56:24,289
Why do people
even have children? Why?

828
00:56:29,299 --> 00:56:32,234
Whoa! You are my hero!

829
00:56:32,302 --> 00:56:33,769
l'll write songs about you.

830
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,806
Look!

831
00:56:38,141 --> 00:56:40,200
They stopped for juicers?

832
00:56:40,277 --> 00:56:41,972
- They're still in the game?
- Let's go!

833
00:56:51,254 --> 00:56:52,619
Come on! Go faster!

834
00:57:05,135 --> 00:57:06,102
Tie!

835
00:57:06,203 --> 00:57:08,637
Calm your jets.
Let's compare goods first.

836
00:57:13,076 --> 00:57:16,773
So, all things being equal,
tiebreaker.

837
00:57:16,847 --> 00:57:19,782
What? No, we share the spot.

838
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:22,284
Share? With you?
Don't think so.

839
00:57:22,352 --> 00:57:24,149
Tiebreaker, winner take all.

840
00:57:24,221 --> 00:57:25,552
You're on.

841
00:57:25,622 --> 00:57:29,388
First one to get the king
or queen's crown at the dance, wins.

842
00:57:29,459 --> 00:57:30,551
What?

843
00:57:30,627 --> 00:57:33,095
Staci, isn't that Todd's car?

844
00:57:33,163 --> 00:57:34,926
That is his car.

845
00:57:35,031 --> 00:57:40,401
l thought you guys decided
you were skipping the dance, Staci.

846
00:57:47,644 --> 00:57:50,135
Are we really going into the dance?

847
00:57:51,214 --> 00:57:53,114
You bet we are. Follow.

848
00:58:14,204 --> 00:58:16,069
Tickets, please.

849
00:58:16,139 --> 00:58:19,074
Hold on. Where's your ticket?

850
00:58:19,142 --> 00:58:21,007
Oh, l...

851
00:58:23,246 --> 00:58:24,440
...don't have one.

852
00:58:24,514 --> 00:58:27,745
Sorry. No ticket, no dance.

853
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:32,254
l know who you are.

854
00:58:34,758 --> 00:58:36,020
You do?

855
00:58:36,092 --> 00:58:40,426
You're out here collecting tickets
instead of being inside at the dance.

856
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:43,863
You spend your weekends
doing extra-credit algebra,

857
00:58:43,934 --> 00:58:47,267
you play way too much
Monopoly with your parents,

858
00:58:47,337 --> 00:58:51,330
and you've never eaten
anywhere near the fountain.

859
00:58:51,408 --> 00:58:56,812
And in four years, l will be you
unless l get into that dance.

860
00:59:04,588 --> 00:59:05,953
You go.

861
00:59:06,022 --> 00:59:09,082
Get in there.
Do it for all those who never could.

862
00:59:09,159 --> 00:59:12,219
- Did we win?
- Almost. We still have to get the crown.

863
00:59:14,164 --> 00:59:16,189
Get...crown.

864
00:59:18,134 --> 00:59:19,624
What crown?

865
00:59:34,251 --> 00:59:37,778
So this is it--
a high school dance.

866
00:59:37,854 --> 00:59:40,687
They don't even let us
wear shoes at our dances.

867
00:59:40,757 --> 00:59:42,657
And they serve warm Kool-Aid.

868
00:59:42,726 --> 00:59:45,286
l wonder if Steve's here.

869
00:59:48,298 --> 00:59:51,631
Hey, spazmonkey, stand still.

870
00:59:51,701 --> 00:59:53,259
Let's scope.

871
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,567
Where is Todd?
Do you see him?

872
00:59:59,643 --> 01:00:02,510
Not yet. Remain calm
until the evidence is in.

873
01:00:08,752 --> 01:00:11,312
Are you gonna ask someone to dance?
Come on, ask someone to dance.

874
01:00:11,388 --> 01:00:13,481
No, man, just leave me alone.

875
01:00:13,556 --> 01:00:15,046
Dude.

876
01:00:16,459 --> 01:00:18,086
You guys remember a girl
named Julie Corky?

877
01:00:18,161 --> 01:00:21,153
Wasn't she on our grade school bus?

878
01:00:21,264 --> 01:00:23,789
Yes. l knew that was her.

879
01:00:24,868 --> 01:00:26,927
Gregg and l saw her
boarding tonight in a red dress.

880
01:00:28,038 --> 01:00:29,369
She looked sweet.

881
01:00:29,439 --> 01:00:30,531
Nice one.

882
01:00:30,607 --> 01:00:32,871
Hi. Hey.

883
01:00:32,943 --> 01:00:36,174
Hi. Do you...

884
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:39,772
...know if your friend wants to dance?

885
01:00:41,351 --> 01:00:42,841
l don't know. Ask him.

886
01:00:42,919 --> 01:00:44,819
Could you ask him for me?

887
01:00:47,958 --> 01:00:52,691
Dude, that girl,
my dream girl, dance with her.

888
01:00:56,666 --> 01:00:57,633
Sure.

889
01:01:08,678 --> 01:01:10,669
Maybe they just met.

890
01:01:11,648 --> 01:01:13,912
Yeah. Maybe.

891
01:01:13,984 --> 01:01:15,815
Almost time for
the big dance contest,

892
01:01:15,885 --> 01:01:18,012
and remember, anything goes,

893
01:01:18,088 --> 01:01:20,682
so just pretend
that Mrs. Withers and l aren't here.

894
01:01:21,691 --> 01:01:24,159
Badness. Look over there!

895
01:01:26,563 --> 01:01:27,530
Come on!

896
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:42,505
Guess you changed your mind
about the dance.

897
01:01:42,579 --> 01:01:43,637
Staci.

898
01:01:47,317 --> 01:01:48,841
Who the hell are you?

899
01:01:48,918 --> 01:01:51,011
- l'm his girlfriend.
- Oh, really?

900
01:01:51,087 --> 01:01:54,614
Because l'm his girlfriend.
Have been for six months.

901
01:01:58,228 --> 01:02:00,594
Catfight! Meow!

902
01:02:16,413 --> 01:02:19,780
Stay away from my footballer.

903
01:02:19,849 --> 01:02:21,214
You can have him!

904
01:02:23,553 --> 01:02:25,544
Hey, where you going?

905
01:02:25,622 --> 01:02:27,886
Get real. She's not worth it.

906
01:02:27,957 --> 01:02:29,447
Are you kidding?

907
01:02:29,526 --> 01:02:32,859
Staci? Staci's a prime goddess.

908
01:02:32,929 --> 01:02:36,126
lf l had a girl like Staci,
l would worship her.

909
01:02:36,232 --> 01:02:38,757
She hooked up with you,
and now you dump her?

910
01:02:38,868 --> 01:02:40,961
What a typical quarterback move.

911
01:02:41,071 --> 01:02:45,838
Princess doesn't hook up.
Never has, never will.

912
01:02:48,011 --> 01:02:49,308
l...

913
01:02:49,379 --> 01:02:52,075
Looks like someone
isn't so different from us after all.

914
01:02:53,083 --> 01:02:54,345
All right, everybody grab a partner.

915
01:02:54,417 --> 01:02:57,284
The mojo dance contest
is about to begin.

916
01:02:57,353 --> 01:03:00,151
Come on, Todd. Let's go
command the dance contest.

917
01:03:01,658 --> 01:03:04,991
Too bad. So sad.

918
01:03:05,061 --> 01:03:07,427
Guess you don't have
anyone to enter with.

919
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:09,054
Yes l do.

920
01:03:10,166 --> 01:03:11,633
You've got to be kidding.

921
01:03:11,734 --> 01:03:14,703
Staci, did the fall
give you brain damage?

922
01:03:14,771 --> 01:03:18,207
Bite me! l can dance!

923
01:03:22,846 --> 01:03:24,473
What do you say, girlfriends?

924
01:03:24,547 --> 01:03:26,242
But we don't have
anyone to dance with.

925
01:03:26,316 --> 01:03:28,546
Who else do we need?
Let's go!

926
01:04:31,581 --> 01:04:34,209
Freshman year, we have arrived!

927
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:41,823
What is it?

928
01:04:41,891 --> 01:04:43,552
Some sort of list.

929
01:04:43,626 --> 01:04:45,821
''PatrolTec decal.

930
01:04:45,895 --> 01:04:47,328
''This one's for Julie--

931
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:49,898
Get Steve Phillips' boxer shorts.''

932
01:04:49,999 --> 01:04:52,467
That's where my boxers went!

933
01:04:52,535 --> 01:04:54,002
''Get crown.''

934
01:04:54,103 --> 01:04:56,970
Dude, look,
it's the girl in the red dress!

935
01:05:47,991 --> 01:05:50,551
There's clearly
one shining couple here tonight,

936
01:05:50,627 --> 01:05:53,596
and here they are, the winners
of the mojo dance contest!

937
01:05:55,698 --> 01:05:56,824
Whatever.

938
01:05:56,933 --> 01:05:59,128
Well, you aren't a very good dancer.

939
01:05:59,235 --> 01:06:00,202
What?

940
01:06:09,912 --> 01:06:10,901
Thanks.

941
01:06:12,915 --> 01:06:16,282
Hey, you want to see
a picture of me in a coma?

942
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,317
Okay.

943
01:06:19,389 --> 01:06:20,822
Really?

944
01:06:25,995 --> 01:06:27,622
Sweet.

945
01:06:30,233 --> 01:06:34,636
You know, this doesn't mean that we're,
like, boyfriend and girlfriend or anything.

946
01:06:34,704 --> 01:06:36,968
Oh, l know,
but now l've got this picture,

947
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:40,999
and this picture is way better
than my coma picture.

948
01:06:41,077 --> 01:06:45,138
Dude, you are an insta-legend.

949
01:06:46,149 --> 01:06:47,878
Could we have our picture
taken with you?

950
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,309
Be cool, guys.

951
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:58,823
This is the sweetest slumber party ever.

952
01:06:58,895 --> 01:07:01,056
Yeah. Aren't you glad
Staci couldn't come?

953
01:07:01,164 --> 01:07:02,153
What? Why?

954
01:07:02,231 --> 01:07:05,257
Because Julie's mom only let her
invite three girls.

955
01:07:07,303 --> 01:07:09,203
l...

956
01:07:09,272 --> 01:07:11,297
was the replacement?

957
01:07:11,374 --> 01:07:14,241
l mean...no.

958
01:07:14,310 --> 01:07:16,540
l was the replacement.

959
01:07:18,481 --> 01:07:19,812
What did you say to her?

960
01:07:19,882 --> 01:07:23,318
- l didn't mean to. lt just...
- What?

961
01:07:24,387 --> 01:07:27,584
l told her that she
replaced Staci at the party.

962
01:07:27,657 --> 01:07:29,022
Oh, no.

963
01:07:29,092 --> 01:07:30,719
l'm sorry.

964
01:07:30,793 --> 01:07:33,353
Let's go find her. Come on.

965
01:07:35,698 --> 01:07:37,393
Before Mr. Chilton announces
the king and queen,

966
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:39,434
we have a special dedication,

967
01:07:39,502 --> 01:07:41,129
to Yancy

968
01:07:41,237 --> 01:07:43,137
from the speaker-moving guy.

969
01:08:11,334 --> 01:08:12,995
What are you doing here?

970
01:08:13,102 --> 01:08:14,694
l told you l had another gig.

971
01:08:14,804 --> 01:08:16,237
l saw you dancing out there.

972
01:08:16,305 --> 01:08:19,103
l thought you might want to
try with a partner.

973
01:08:19,675 --> 01:08:20,664
Yes.

974
01:08:28,684 --> 01:08:31,244
Someone for everyone...

975
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,220
except me.

976
01:08:34,223 --> 01:08:38,717
On the bright yet dim side,
we could still win the scavenger hunt.

977
01:08:38,795 --> 01:08:39,784
True.

978
01:08:39,862 --> 01:08:41,887
Where do you think
they keep those crowns?

979
01:08:42,999 --> 01:08:44,523
Come on.

980
01:08:45,635 --> 01:08:48,103
- Do you like brownies?
- Are you kidding?

981
01:08:48,171 --> 01:08:51,004
Brownies are
a very important food group.

982
01:08:55,545 --> 01:08:56,910
The crowns aren't here.

983
01:08:56,979 --> 01:08:58,776
So you haven't won.

984
01:08:58,848 --> 01:08:59,837
Yet.

985
01:08:59,916 --> 01:09:03,352
We're not giving the fountain spot
to you Dumpster frumpsters.

986
01:09:03,453 --> 01:09:05,546
Talk, talk, talk, and no action.

987
01:09:08,691 --> 01:09:11,285
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

988
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,828
You've been voting all week
for king and queen.

989
01:09:14,864 --> 01:09:18,129
Jennifer Allen and Steve Phillips.

990
01:09:19,235 --> 01:09:20,293
He won?

991
01:09:20,403 --> 01:09:22,098
Steve won!

992
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:27,573
Jennifer's a bud of mine,
a former cheer squad leader.

993
01:09:27,643 --> 01:09:29,133
She'll give me the crown for sure.

994
01:09:33,749 --> 01:09:35,307
Choose your partners, guys.

995
01:09:35,384 --> 01:09:37,079
This song's reserved for you.

996
01:09:46,028 --> 01:09:50,590
Julie? Julie Corky?

997
01:09:56,005 --> 01:09:57,870
He just said your name!

998
01:09:58,941 --> 01:10:00,203
That was real?

999
01:10:00,276 --> 01:10:01,504
Yes!

1000
01:10:13,322 --> 01:10:14,812
Wanna dance?

1001
01:10:29,772 --> 01:10:32,605
l didn't even know you knew who l was.

1002
01:10:43,986 --> 01:10:45,248
You win.

1003
01:10:47,723 --> 01:10:49,987
- Julie got the crown!
- We win!

1004
01:10:50,059 --> 01:10:51,959
We win the scavenger hunt!

1005
01:10:52,028 --> 01:10:53,996
l knew it! l knew it!
l knew it!

1006
01:10:54,063 --> 01:10:56,031
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?

1007
01:10:56,098 --> 01:10:58,658
You were so sure we'd win,
you gave away our spot.

1008
01:10:58,768 --> 01:11:01,066
Let us know
how the Dumpster tables are.

1009
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:04,264
- l hear they have gum on them.
- And other unmentionables.

1010
01:11:04,307 --> 01:11:05,740
Unmentionables?

1011
01:11:05,808 --> 01:11:08,208
l cannot eat on unmentionables.

1012
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,161
How did you know?

1013
01:11:33,269 --> 01:11:34,736
Know?

1014
01:11:35,838 --> 01:11:38,864
About me and you...
and the crown?

1015
01:11:38,941 --> 01:11:41,205
l saw you boarding earlier tonight.

1016
01:11:41,277 --> 01:11:44,041
And then l saw you out there dancing.

1017
01:11:45,114 --> 01:11:46,103
lt all fit.

1018
01:11:47,183 --> 01:11:48,309
And the crown...

1019
01:11:49,218 --> 01:11:51,948
By the way,
can l have my boxers back?

1020
01:11:53,956 --> 01:11:55,719
l like your laugh.

1021
01:12:04,533 --> 01:12:07,866
- l'm sorry. lt might be...
- Go ahead.

1022
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:13,498
- Hello?
- Where are you guys?

1023
01:12:13,576 --> 01:12:15,544
- ls Mom home?
- Well, no, but she--

Julie. she just called.
She's or her way. so get home. Now.

1026
01:12:23,386 --> 01:12:25,286
Who was it? Was it your mom?

1027
01:12:26,589 --> 01:12:29,956
My mom doesn't know we left the house,
and she's on her way home right now.

1028
01:12:30,026 --> 01:12:32,824
What? She's on her way home?
Let's go!

1029
01:12:32,895 --> 01:12:35,056
Unbelievable as it is, l have to go.

1030
01:12:35,164 --> 01:12:36,631
l'm sorry.

1031
01:12:42,972 --> 01:12:43,939
All right.

1032
01:12:44,974 --> 01:12:46,236
Good time.

1033
01:12:48,978 --> 01:12:50,411
l didn't get the kiss.

1034
01:12:50,479 --> 01:12:51,468
What?

1035
01:12:52,481 --> 01:12:54,244
He's gonna wake up tomorrow

1036
01:12:54,316 --> 01:12:57,012
and realize that l'm just
some average little freshman.

1037
01:12:57,086 --> 01:12:59,452
l had my chance, and l missed it.

1038
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:02,618
Whoo! Crank it!

1039
01:13:02,692 --> 01:13:03,681
Whoo!

1040
01:13:03,759 --> 01:13:04,748
Yeah!

1041
01:13:05,761 --> 01:13:08,252
We should do this once a week.

1042
01:13:10,933 --> 01:13:11,900
My crown!

1043
01:13:12,001 --> 01:13:14,765
Hey, tiny green car!

1044
01:13:19,809 --> 01:13:21,242
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1045
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:23,972

in the name of PatrolTec Security.

Please evacuate...hey! Hey!

1048
01:13:36,759 --> 01:13:40,160
Hi, Mom, could you pick me up?
l'm on the corner of Union and Grant.

1049
01:13:40,229 --> 01:13:42,493
l-l really don't want to talk about it.

1050
01:13:51,474 --> 01:13:52,771
What are we gonna do?

1051
01:13:54,877 --> 01:13:56,071
Come on!

1052
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,479
The fort!

1053
01:13:59,548 --> 01:14:01,539

- Trust me.

1054
01:14:14,563 --> 01:14:16,531
Come on! Come on!

1055
01:14:16,632 --> 01:14:17,599
Get up.

1056
01:14:21,971 --> 01:14:22,938
Catch it!

1057
01:14:31,714 --> 01:14:33,409
Julie, what are you doing?

1058
01:14:33,482 --> 01:14:35,609
- Julie, no.
- You're gonna fall!

1059
01:14:35,684 --> 01:14:37,675
- Julie!
- She's gonna fall!

1060
01:14:46,762 --> 01:14:47,990
Oh, my God!

1061
01:14:49,932 --> 01:14:51,456
You guys, help!

1062
01:14:59,642 --> 01:15:01,132
Julie, are you okay?

1063
01:15:01,243 --> 01:15:02,608
What about you?

1064
01:15:03,646 --> 01:15:05,136
Just go.

1065
01:15:05,214 --> 01:15:07,808
Hey, come on, let's go.

1066
01:15:09,585 --> 01:15:11,450
Take care. Thanks for driving.

1067
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:15,081
- l'll see you later.
- Bye, girls.

1068
01:15:15,157 --> 01:15:17,717
- You forgot your scarf.
- Thank you.

1069
01:15:31,907 --> 01:15:32,931
Hi.

1070
01:15:33,108 --> 01:15:34,598
Hi.

1071
01:15:34,677 --> 01:15:37,168
So, how was the party?

1072
01:15:37,246 --> 01:15:38,577
Quiet.

1073
01:15:39,648 --> 01:15:40,740
Quiet?

1074
01:15:43,419 --> 01:15:46,149
Wait. l want to
show you something. Come here.

1075
01:15:49,225 --> 01:15:52,683
This is our old water. Have a taste.

1076
01:15:55,097 --> 01:15:56,860
- Okay?
- Okay.

1077
01:15:56,966 --> 01:15:59,491
Now try our brand-new water.

1078
01:16:05,741 --> 01:16:07,003
Honey...

1079
01:16:08,077 --> 01:16:10,204
this definitely tastes better.

1080
01:16:10,279 --> 01:16:12,747
- Oh, gosh.
- Thank you.

1081
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:17,708
- Did you have fun at the club?
- l did, but l missed you.

1082
01:16:17,786 --> 01:16:19,981
Everybody needs
a night out now and then.

1083
01:16:20,055 --> 01:16:22,080
You know what? They do.

1084
01:16:22,157 --> 01:16:23,818
Let's go check on the girls.

1085
01:16:23,893 --> 01:16:24,882
Okay.

1086
01:16:26,662 --> 01:16:28,357
Assume sleep positions!

1087
01:16:59,662 --> 01:17:02,096
Told ya. No problem.

1088
01:17:07,202 --> 01:17:09,534
- What's with him?
- l don't know.

1089
01:17:15,377 --> 01:17:17,072
We really did it.

1090
01:17:18,147 --> 01:17:22,413
My Cinderella night,
and l'm still the ugly stepsister.

1091
01:17:31,727 --> 01:17:33,786
Ladies, time to get up.

1092
01:17:33,862 --> 01:17:35,887
There's gonna be pancakes!

1093
01:17:39,635 --> 01:17:41,603
How long were we asleep?

1094
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:42,830
Ten minutes.

1095
01:17:43,906 --> 01:17:45,999
Funny. Feels like five.

1096
01:17:50,079 --> 01:17:52,912
You know, l always knew
that old fort would come down one day.

1097
01:17:52,982 --> 01:17:55,212
l just didn't think it would
take the arbor down with it.

1098
01:17:56,185 --> 01:17:58,676
Hey, this water's not so bad, Dad.

1099
01:17:58,754 --> 01:18:00,187
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1100
01:18:00,255 --> 01:18:01,187
Well, thank you.

1101
01:18:02,191 --> 01:18:04,091
What are we gonna do
about the backyard?

1102
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:07,856
You might be on your own there, Dad.

1103
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:10,558
l've decided to go back to college.

1104
01:18:12,868 --> 01:18:14,233
That's great.

1105
01:18:14,303 --> 01:18:16,294
Yeah, l mean, last night
kinda got me to thinking,

1106
01:18:16,405 --> 01:18:18,066
you know, high school rocked,

1107
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:21,268
but it's time to leave it to sis.

1108
01:18:21,343 --> 01:18:24,369
l think l may have
a career ahead in surveillance.

1109
01:18:24,446 --> 01:18:26,880
l hear PatrolTec has an opening.

1110
01:18:30,085 --> 01:18:31,552
So...

1111
01:18:33,389 --> 01:18:36,825
exactly what
did you girls do last night?

1112
01:18:37,393 --> 01:18:38,792
Exactly?

1113
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:43,188
Exactly.

1114
01:18:46,935 --> 01:18:48,402
Here's the thing, Mom.

1115
01:18:50,472 --> 01:18:51,803
The thing is...

1116
01:18:54,143 --> 01:18:56,509
We left the house,

1117
01:18:56,578 --> 01:19:01,311
but l assure you, it was for
a very important adolescent cause.

1118
01:19:01,417 --> 01:19:02,577
Adolescent?

1119
01:19:04,586 --> 01:19:06,645
As in ''growing up''?

1120
01:19:06,722 --> 01:19:09,054
ls that so hard to believe?

1121
01:19:09,124 --> 01:19:10,648
Yes, it is,

1122
01:19:10,726 --> 01:19:15,527
because not too long ago
l had a little girl who took ballet.

1123
01:19:15,631 --> 01:19:17,656
She did magic tricks.

1124
01:19:17,766 --> 01:19:21,327
We used to bake together
in her Easy-Bake oven,

1125
01:19:21,437 --> 01:19:24,770
and she loved ponies and ladybugs.

1126
01:19:27,009 --> 01:19:28,670
l remember her.

1127
01:19:28,744 --> 01:19:32,612
l guess l missed the bridge
between ladybugs and boys.

1128
01:19:34,183 --> 01:19:36,276
l think l'm still standing on that bridge.

1129
01:19:41,290 --> 01:19:43,758
You take your time crossing it.

1130
01:19:43,826 --> 01:19:45,418
Got you something.

1131
01:19:52,734 --> 01:19:54,565
A doorknob?

1132
01:19:54,636 --> 01:19:56,433
With a lock.

1133
01:19:59,842 --> 01:20:02,504
To the urstoppable freshmer.

1134
01:20:02,578 --> 01:20:04,273
Unstoppable!

1135
01:20:08,884 --> 01:20:11,614
- That's my mom.
- She's giving me a ride.

1136
01:20:12,621 --> 01:20:14,612
l have to get home
and finish packing.

1137
01:20:17,559 --> 01:20:19,857
- Bye!
- Bye!

1138
01:20:19,928 --> 01:20:21,327
Bye!

1139
01:20:21,430 --> 01:20:23,694
- l had a fun time!
- Thank you!

1140
01:20:32,975 --> 01:20:36,502
So...this is it.

1141
01:20:37,646 --> 01:20:39,876
You're really moving.

1142
01:20:42,651 --> 01:20:44,516
Everything changes now.

1143
01:20:44,586 --> 01:20:46,816
Everything would have changed anyway.

1144
01:20:48,157 --> 01:20:50,148
Last night did that.

1145
01:20:52,227 --> 01:20:54,752
Tell me how the view is
from the lunch spot.

1146
01:20:55,864 --> 01:20:57,855
lf we sit there.

1147
01:20:57,966 --> 01:20:59,024
What do you mean?

1148
01:20:59,134 --> 01:21:02,865
Wherever we sit,
that'll be the lunch spot.

1149
01:21:05,874 --> 01:21:07,739
You're ready for high school.

1150
01:21:12,214 --> 01:21:13,476
l blame you.

1151
01:21:22,891 --> 01:21:24,722
Take care of the girls.

1152
01:21:33,101 --> 01:21:34,591
Don't forget.

1153
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:42,843
Never.

1154
01:22:53,515 --> 01:22:55,005
l think this is yours.

1155
01:23:11,466 --> 01:23:13,696
Ard so it happered--

1156
01:23:13,769 --> 01:23:17,205
the girl ir the lopsided crowr
got her kiss.

1157
01:23:17,306 --> 01:23:19,399
Naturally. h told Harrah all about it.

1158
01:23:19,474 --> 01:23:21,567
h try to keep her up-to-date
with high school.

1159
01:23:21,643 --> 01:23:23,838
which is goirg surprisirgly well...

1160
01:23:23,912 --> 01:23:25,072

As for Staci ard Liz...

01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:29,550
