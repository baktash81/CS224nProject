1
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,919
And cut!

2
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,799
- Wow. That was so amazing!
- Walter, you did a wonderful job.

3
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,279
Thank you, Kermit. Did we get that?

4
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,720
- We got it.
- We got it, yup.

5
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:51,007
<i>Movie's over, people.
Go home. That is a wrap.</i>

6
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,719
Okay, nice work, everyone.

7
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,730
Make sure to fill out your I-9s,
and we'll see you on the next one.

8
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,559
So... What do we do now?

9
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,799
Well, we're together again.

10
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,599
We got the theater
and all our fans are back.

11
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,847
Yeah!

12
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,319
Actually, those were extras.

13
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,199
I saw a few tapping their toes.

14
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,839
Yeah, those were paid dancers.

15
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,119
Or...

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,971
Maybe since we're all here,

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,806
now could be the perfect time for
you and me to tie the knot, Kermie!

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,999
Well, I mean, maybe I could.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,999
Hey, what's the camera
still doing here?

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,999
Oh, no. Disaster! That
can only mean one thing.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,283
Doggone it, you're right! It looks
like they've ordered a sequel.

22
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,399
<i>We're doing a sequel</i>

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,199
<i>We're back by popular demand</i>

24
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,719
<i>Come on, everybody,
strike up the band!</i>

25
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,719
<i>We're doing a sequel</i>

26
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,279
<i>That's what we do in Hollywood</i>

27
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,159
<i>And everybody knows</i>

28
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,519
<i>That the sequel's
never quite as good</i>

29
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,799
<i>A sequel
Another feature attraction</i>

30
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,399
<i>Places, please
Light the lights</i>

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,250
<i>Roll camera, "Action!"</i>

32
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,119
<i>I thought it was the end</i>

33
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,479
<i>But no, my friends, this is when</i>

34
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,250
<i>We get to do it all again!</i>

35
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,759
<i>Do it all again</i>

36
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,239
<i>Until the credits roll</i>

37
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,039
<i>We got another go to show them</i>

38
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,402
<i>We can do it all again!</i>

39
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,359
<i>We're doing a sequel
There's no need to disguise</i>

40
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,239
<i>The studio considers us
a viable franchise</i>

41
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,199
<i>We're doing a sequel
The studio wants more</i>

42
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,039
<i>While they wait for Tom Hanks</i>

43
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,765
<i>To make Toy Story 4!</i>

44
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,999
<i>I thought it was the end</i>

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,039
<i>But no, my friends, this is when</i>

46
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,639
<i>We get to do it all again!</i>

47
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,559
<i>Do it all again!</i>

48
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,119
<i>Until the credits roll</i>

49
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,199
<i>We've got another go to show them</i>

50
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,528
<i>We can do it all again!</i>

51
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,319
<i>We're doing a sequel</i>

52
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,443
<i>Let's give it a go</i>

53
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,721
<i>With Hollywood stars</i>

54
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,319
<i>And more one-liner cameos</i>

55
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,851
<i>We're doing a sequel</i>

56
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,479
<i>I don't mean to be a stickler</i>

57
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,319
<i>But this is the seventh sequel</i>

58
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,759
<i>To our original motion picture</i>

59
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,119
<i>We're doing a sequel</i>

60
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,049
<i>Let's give it a shot</i>

61
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,287
<i>All we need now is
a half-decent plot</i>

62
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,719
Got it. An epic love story

63
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,799
between a very handsome,
long-nosed purple thing

64
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,239
and a beautiful chicken.

65
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,599
<i>Gonzo with the Wind.</i>

66
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,799
Does anybody have any other ideas?

67
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,719
It's about getting the
Muppets back together again

68
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,799
to stop an evil oil baron from
demolishing the old studio!

69
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,604
Fozzie, did you even
watch our last film?

70
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:44,079
It's about a frog who marries
a beautiful, perfect pig.

71
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,647
And they have to kiss
each other a lot!

72
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,371
I don't think Americans
watch subtitled films.

73
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,450
Kermit, how about the
Muppets go on a world tour?

74
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,131
That's perfect!

75
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,599
<i>I thought it was the end</i>

76
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,559
<i>But no, my friends, this is when</i>

77
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,525
<i>We get to do it all again!</i>

78
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,679
<i>Until the credits roll</i>

79
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,799
<i>We've got another go to show them</i>

80
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,684
<i>We can do it all again!</i>

81
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,919
<i>We're doing a sequel</i>

82
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,439
<i>It's more of the same
Let's give it a name</i>

83
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,639
<i>How about The Muppets Again?</i>

84
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,845
<i>It's the Muppets again
with The Muppets Again</i>

85
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,402
<i>It's the</i>

86
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,289
<i>Muppets</i>

87
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,411
<i>Again!</i>

88
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,799
- Okay?
- I'm okay!

89
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,161
Okay!

90
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,163
Booma-booma!

91
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,925
Hey! Pepperoni!

92
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,645
Come on!

93
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,360
Let's dance.

94
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,651
It's time to light the lights.

95
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,959
<i>Muppet news flash.</i>

96
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,959
<i>Constantine, the world's
most dangerous frog,</i>

97
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,359
<i>has escaped from
a maximum security gulag</i>

98
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,199
<i>in Siberia, Russia.</i>

99
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,639
<i>This move has
leapfrogged Constantine</i>

100
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,479
<i>to the number one most wanted
criminal in the world,</i>

101
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,843
<i>one place ahead
of the mysterious Lemur.</i>

102
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,799
Wow.

103
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,321
Thanks for seeing me at my
regular booth, Muppets.

104
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,999
Big fan. Huge.

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,519
Dominic. International
tour manager.

106
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,279
"Dominic Badguy"?

107
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,211
It's pronounced
"Bad-gee." It's French.

108
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,119
It means "good man."

109
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,479
Oh, yes.

110
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,920
Listen up.

111
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,639
You're hot. You're having a moment.

112
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,439
But what is inevitable
about a moment? It ends.

113
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,199
I don't want this moment to end!

114
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,759
That's why we got to
get out there now

115
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,159
and capitalize on this
moment with a capital yeah?

116
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,599
I want you to conquer the world.
Do an international tour.

117
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,879
Show a global audience
what you can do.

118
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,679
Yeah, that sounds great
but I'm just not sure...

119
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,479
Wait a second, guys, listen.
I'd love to do that, too.

120
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,319
But we've barely gotten back together.
We don't want to mess that up.

121
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,319
Okay, I am inundated with offers
of management at the moment.

122
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:30,119
One Direction, U2, Cirque du Soleil.
Just some of the acts I can list.

123
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,679
Wow, that's a good list!

124
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,679
And now, I wanna tour
manage you guys.

125
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,039
I know you're the boss, Kermit.
I wouldn't interfere with that.

126
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,239
We would share our managerial roles

127
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,839
because you've got a special
bond with these little guys.

128
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,326
Sure.

129
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,199
President Clinton?

130
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,519
What?

131
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,839
I'm on my way, Number Two.

132
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,399
Great, they're taking the bait.

133
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,599
- Well, he seems like a nice guy.
- Yeah.

134
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,479
Humble and honest.

135
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,719
I just... I think we have to
get settled first, you know?

136
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,239
Hone the show, get some new material,
and then maybe go on a world tour.

137
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,559
See you in Berlin.

138
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,599
Yes. Auf Wiedersehen,

139
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,087
Number Two.

140
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,639
So...

141
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,599
What's it gonna be, Muppets?

142
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,079
Ready to be world famous?

143
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,328
No pressure, but I
am a very busy man.

144
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,648
That's Rihanna.
I really should take this.

145
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,959
World tour! World tour!

146
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,759
Well, I mean...

147
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,759
I guess we could always hone our acts
on the road, and that would be okay.

148
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,119
Wouldn't it, Kermit?

149
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,802
World tour! World tour!
Come on, froggy!

150
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,801
Okay, let's do it.

151
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,969
Dominic, you're hired.

152
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,959
Thanks, Kermit. I mean, boss.

153
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,208
You won't regret this.

154
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,559
Is everybody here? Yeah?

155
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,279
Okay, guys, guys. Get them
up and move them out.

156
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,239
All aboard, Dominic.

157
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,319
I didn't know there was
still third class.

158
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,761
Third class? How about no class?

159
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,639
Watch the heels!

160
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,639
Piggy. Why do you need
so much luggage?

161
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,319
For our honeymoon, of course!

162
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,521
For our what?

163
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,124
Let's go, guys!

164
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,119
That must be reverse.

165
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,130
Oh, well. This way looks good, too.

166
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,439
<i>Okay, Dominic, I thought we could
start our world tour in London.</i>

167
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,399
<i>Or how about the world
capital of comedy?</i>

168
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,125
<i>Berlin, Germany.</i>

169
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,721
<i>Germany!</i>

170
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,882
Was that supposed to happen?

171
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,485
<i>You guys are gonna love this place.</i>

172
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,319
Okay, here we are, guys.

173
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,879
The Hole in the Wall Club!

174
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,039
"Die Muppets"?

175
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,039
Looks like they put
the reviews up early.

176
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,402
Yeah, or is that the
suggestion box?

177
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,479
"Hole in the Wall Club"?

178
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,199
More like "Hole in
the Ground Club."

179
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,279
Okay, everybody.

180
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,879
So, we'll start at the bottom
and work our way up.

181
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,879
I've booked us into cabaret
bars and coffee houses

182
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,526
all across the industrial
cities of Northern Germany.

183
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,719
Dusseldorf, Hamburg,
Mudburg, Vomitdorf.

184
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,319
Poopenburgen?

185
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,364
Fozzie, we have a solid week
booked in Poopenburgen.

186
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,399
This looks great.

187
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,286
And I think we should commend
Kermit on his efforts.

188
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,239
Thank you, Dominic. Thanks.

189
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,679
Or, if I might be so bold,

190
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,123
maybe we could consider
another venue.

191
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,681
Another venue?

192
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,159
To be precise, this other venue.

193
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,879
Look at that theater!

194
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,759
What? No, no.

195
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,519
We don't have the money to rent
the Berlin National Theatre!

196
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,759
We'll make our money back
when we sell it out.

197
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,759
Kermie, I've always dreamed of
playing the Berlin National Theatre.

198
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,439
<i>"Ich bin ein Berliner."</i>

199
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,199
More like, "Ein frankfurter"!

200
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,759
Watch it, buster.

201
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,119
Guys, I'm not sure
we can do this, you know?

202
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,719
Okay, let's put this to the vote.

203
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,919
All those in favor
of believing in ourselves,

204
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,326
raise your hands.

205
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,559
That's not what I'm saying.

206
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,331
And all those in favor
of just giving up.

207
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,879
I can't believe I'm
voting for giving up.

208
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,323
Good. Well, I'm glad
we made this decision.

209
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,919
Wonderful!

210
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,959
So cool!

211
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,289
Isn't that exciting.
I can't believe it.

212
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,239
All right, gather round,
troops. Everybody?

213
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,639
Okay, guys.

214
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,879
Since we're playing such a big theater,
let's stick with what we know.

215
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,479
We'll open with a cabaret number...

216
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,047
Kermit, when do I do the
indoor running of the bulls?

217
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,919
Mr. Kermit, sir?

218
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,966
I would very much like to demonstrate
my magnetic bomb-attractor vest.

219
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,119
Bunsen, why would you even
invent one of those?

220
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,971
Why did I invent the
unexpectedly exploding cupcake?

221
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,239
Hey, what about Muppet Ladder?

222
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,479
Muppet Ladder? That's
never, ever worked, Gonzo.

223
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,639
Last time we all tried that
was 20 years ago

224
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,679
and you ended up
in a cast for six months.

225
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,999
Yeah, good times.

226
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,319
Kermit, what if I do four
or five Celine Dion songs?

227
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,919
You know Celine Dion,
she works in Vegas.

228
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,279
No, Piggy, there's
no time for that.

229
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,639
What about the band's
marathon jam session?

230
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,879
Drum solo! Drum solo!

231
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,445
No drum solo!

232
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,881
Guys, guys, guys!

233
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,119
We can't just do whatever we want.

234
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,759
This is our opening night.

235
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,327
Let's play to our
strengths, because...

236
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,599
Well...

237
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,159
Look, I didn't want
to worry you guys

238
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,759
but if we don't sell this theater out,
it would mean the end of the tour.

239
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,119
What?

240
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,359
And maybe the end of us.

241
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,839
Great news, Muppets.
We're sold out.

242
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,087
What?

243
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,839
Fine.

244
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,199
I mean, great, great.
Well done, Dominic.

245
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,799
Hey, I have an amazing
idea for an act.

246
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,719
It's called "The Indoor
Running of the Bulls."

247
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,559
Gonzo, I've told you, that
act is far too dangerous.

248
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,206
Actually, Kermit, I was asking
Dominic what he thinks.

249
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,839
Good grief.

250
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,963
Dominic, Dominic! Five songs.

251
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,087
"Sold out." Like we've
sold out a show in 30 years.

252
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,079
Is this a good time to discuss
our upcoming European wedding?

253
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,479
No, actually, I'm kind
of busy right now.

254
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,559
Perfect!

255
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,039
I have 23 swatches for the
seat covers for the reception,

256
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,359
eight font choices for the menu,

257
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,839
which, by the way,
we are not serving flies.

258
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,479
Piggy, what are you talking about?

259
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,159
I'm just trying to involve you in
some of the decision-making, dear.

260
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,879
What about being involved
in the decision

261
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,759
to get married in the
first place, huh?

262
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,719
Kermit, you never let
me do what I want!

263
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,759
Oh, yeah?

264
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,879
Well, what about what I want?
What about that?

265
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,559
I haven't even proposed yet.

266
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,999
- You can do that on our honeymoon.
- What?

267
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,519
That's insane! Do you hear
what you're saying?

268
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,559
Insane? How dare you call
your fiancée insane?

269
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,439
You are not my fiancée!
We are not engaged!

270
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,679
And, as a matter of fact,

271
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,039
the way this particular conversation
is going right now... Well...

272
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,446
I'm fine with that!

273
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,406
Piggy. Wait! I'm sorry!

274
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,206
Get out!

275
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,759
Don't take it personally.
They still love you.

276
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,239
They just prefer me now.

277
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,479
Thank you, Dominic.
That's very comforting.

278
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,319
Do you know what I think helps
sometimes in situations like this?

279
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,479
What?

280
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,119
A walk alone in the fog
in former East Berlin.

281
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,084
Maybe along a deserted canal.

282
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,410
Well, I guess a quiet stroll
is not a bad idea.

283
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,519
Let the others know
I've gone, will you?

284
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,279
Sure. I promise.

285
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,448
Thanks.

286
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,210
Corrine, come here!

287
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,571
Boo.

288
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,085
What just happened?

289
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,921
What?

290
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,124
Wait a second.

291
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,079
Hold on, hold on!
There must be some mistake!

292
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,319
Don't you know me?
I'm Kermit the Frog!

293
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,799
Silence, Constantine.
The game is up.

294
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,126
Who?

295
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,559
No, no! Wait a minute!
I'm Kermit the Frog!

296
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,286
Guys, this is a mistake!
I'm telling you!

297
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,039
Hey, hey! Hello! Somebody!

298
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,599
Open up!

299
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,848
I'm an Amphibian-American!

300
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,440
It's not easy being mean.

301
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,285
Has anyone seen Kermit?

302
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,641
It's 15 minutes to curtain.

303
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,846
Hi, guys. Look, it's Kermit, just
back from his afternoon stroll.

304
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,279
Hi-lo! I am Kermit.

305
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,479
What...

306
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,119
He's got a cold.
That's why his voice

307
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,322
sounds a little bit
different at the moment.

308
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,319
See? Just calm down. Just relax.

309
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,126
You are right. Dominic is terrific!

310
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,119
From now on, let's
do whatever he says.

311
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,879
All right. Yeah.

312
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,119
Wow, that walk
must have really helped.

313
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,279
Miss Pig, I have wronged you.

314
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,719
I humbly beg your forgiveness.

315
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,999
You're not getting off
that easy, bucko.

316
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,850
Come on, Foo Foo.

317
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,723
Bad frog! Bad frog!

318
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,159
What is this? Let go, dog!

319
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,239
Animal, stop it!

320
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,879
Kermit has agreed that Dominic
is right all the time, man.

321
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,999
Good.

322
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,359
So, now that Kermit agrees
with me on everything...

323
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,279
- I am Kermit.
- Definitely.

324
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,999
Let's go and hang out
backstage, yeah?

325
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,565
Okay, all right.

326
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,199
Come, little friend.

327
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,839
Let us get on with the show and
enjoy our family-style adventure

328
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,039
during which we shall bond and
learn heartwarming lesson.

329
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,599
Perhaps about sharing,
or waiting your turn,

330
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,848
or the number three.

331
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,570
Right, Kermit.

332
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,961
Sure.

333
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,199
Flawlessly executed. Bravo.

334
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,199
What did you expect from
world's most dangerous frog

335
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,199
and number one criminal,
Number Two?

336
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,039
Yeah, I know. You're number
one, I'm number two.

337
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,719
I think you mentioned that before.

338
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,639
Now that we control
the Muppet tour, Number Two,

339
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,241
phase one of our plan is complete.

340
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,365
We are now positioned
to carry out greatest...

341
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,079
- "Burglary."
- Yes.

342
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,719
of all time, and pin it
on those gullible Muppets,

343
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,608
who will spend the rest of their
miserable lives behind bars.

344
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,046
Tonight,

345
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,359
we steal the painting

346
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,399
and then we'll have all we need

347
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,766
to steal the unstealable,
the Crown Jewels of England.

348
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,919
Ensuring that my name
goes down in history

349
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,279
as greatest thief of all time!

350
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,759
You mean our names, right?

351
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,439
Of course.

352
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,159
My name first, then spacebar,
spacebar, spacebar, your name.

353
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,239
Sure.

354
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,250
<i>I'm number one
You're number two</i>

355
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,121
<i>We're criminals at large
But I'm at larger than you</i>

356
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,039
<i>I'm number one</i>

357
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,359
<i>You're number two</i>

358
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,759
<i>I believe in equality</i>

359
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,959
<i>As long as you get less than me</i>

360
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,279
<i>- I'm one
- You're one</i>

361
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,439
<i>You're number two</i>

362
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,599
I'm number two.

363
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,759
<i>You may think that you're smarter</i>

364
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,359
<i>But I'm smarterer than you</i>

365
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,281
<i>I'm number one
You're number two</i>

366
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,319
<i>You're lucky to be number two</i>

367
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,726
<i>Not number three</i>

368
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,479
<i>I can see by the look in your eye</i>

369
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,685
<i>You want to get a bigger
piece of the pie</i>

370
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,159
<i>One day you'll get your chance</i>

371
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,039
<i>But in the meantime</i>

372
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,971
<i>You've got to dance, monkey, dance!</i>

373
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,239
Really? I hate dancing.

374
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,319
Do it!

375
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,841
<i>Dance, monkey, dance!</i>

376
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,443
<i>I'm number two
He's number one</i>

377
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,079
<i>I can't believe I'm
working for an amphibian</i>

378
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,239
<i>I'm number two
He's number one</i>

379
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,439
I'm number one!

380
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,439
<i>You know life's gone to the dogs</i>

381
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,881
<i>When your boss is a frog</i>

382
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,239
<i>I can see it's just
a matter of time</i>

383
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,799
<i>Before he's gone</i>

384
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,048
<i>And I'm at the front of the line</i>

385
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,319
<i>It won't be long
till I get my chance</i>

386
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,239
<i>But in the meantime</i>

387
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,807
<i>I've got to dance, monkey, dance</i>

388
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,085
<i>Dance, monkey, dance</i>

389
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,249
Now, watch me.

390
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,399
<i>- I'm number one
- He's number one</i>

391
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,559
<i>- You're number two
- I'm number two</i>

392
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,759
<i>That's it, kid
There you go</i>

393
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,839
<i>Now step aside
This ain't your show</i>

394
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,239
<i>- I'm one
- "I'm one"</i>

395
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,559
<i>I'm number one</i>

396
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,759
<i>Yes, we know</i>

397
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,879
<i>- I'm...
- He's...</i>

398
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,608
<i>Number one!</i>

399
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,725
That's how it's done.

400
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,891
15 seconds to curtain... Kermit?

401
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,200
Sure.

402
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,161
Okay.

403
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,519
Have you studied
your Kermit tapes yet?

404
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,964
Of course not. This is child's
play for frog of my talent.

405
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,719
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome...</i>

406
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,969
"Study Kermit tapes." Nonsense.

407
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,361
It's...

408
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,121
Oh, no.

409
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,760
Kermit! Introduce the show.

410
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,439
It's the Muppet Show!

411
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,565
With our very special guest
star, Christoph Waltz!

412
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,324
What is happening? Why am I flying?

413
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,005
- What the...
- We gotta do something!

414
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,559
Please welcome our first act,

415
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,969
<i>Herr</i> Christoph Waltz
dances the waltz!

416
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:45,081
Darling, you set my world on fire.

417
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,211
Did somebody say "explosion"?

418
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,399
No! He says I set
his world on fire.

419
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,125
There it is again!

420
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,563
Wait for me! Please! Wait for me.

421
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,319
One more!

422
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,851
Keep Waltzing, Mr. Waltz!

423
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,081
Hey!

424
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,719
It was vertigo.

425
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,719
Not stage fright, if that's what
you're thinking, Number Two.

426
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,921
Sure.

427
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,967
Right, now to cover our tracks.

428
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,966
Let's get out of here!

429
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,079
CIA.

430
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,359
Interpol!

431
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,919
What is the CIA doing here?
This is my jurisdiction.

432
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,399
Not to mention, my badge is bigger.

433
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,079
One of the stolen
paintings was on loan

434
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,959
from the New York
Metropolitan Museum of Art.

435
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,919
So, this is CIA jurisdiction.

436
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,639
Also, this is my travel badge.

437
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,759
Here's my real badge.

438
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,599
You must have been
looking at the wrong...

439
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,961
- Badge!
- What?

440
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,639
You've won this round, Pierre.

441
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,639
- My name is "Jean."
- Okay, Shawn.

442
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,959
It looks like we're gonna
be working together.

443
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,439
But that doesn't mean
I have to like you.

444
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,799
I didn't like you first.

445
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,490
I didn't like you before I met you.

446
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,399
So, what have we got?

447
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,439
Two priceless paintings stolen

448
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,759
and one average painting of
an obscure English colonel.

449
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,239
This has all the markings
of the work of the Lemur.

450
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,319
What's a lemur?

451
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,439
Only the second most wanted
criminal in the world.

452
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,999
And my personal nemesis.

453
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,799
Unfortunately for me,
his identity is a mystery.

454
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,519
No, literally, what is a lemur?

455
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,848
It is also a rat-monkey
from Madagascar.

456
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,885
Just as I suspected.

457
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,282
This coin is his calling card.

458
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,319
The Lemur, he is playing with us.

459
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,199
I have a delivery
here for Mr. Eagle.

460
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,401
Right here.

461
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,370
And here's your rope.

462
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,890
You were saying?

463
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,679
Look at that.

464
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,327
"Muppets sell out in
Berlin." Five stars!

465
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,241
Kermit the Frog is
liking this news.

466
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,651
Choo-choo, yeah!

467
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,770
Tunnel.

468
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,359
It's not there.

469
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,599
You were wrong!

470
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,639
Not so fast.

471
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,763
Oldest trick in the book.

472
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,839
Write it in lemon juice,

473
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,999
then simply apply heat

474
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,443
to reveal Colonel Blood's map.

475
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,239
Of course, today,
the Crown Jewels lie behind

476
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,410
the most sophisticated
security system on the planet.

477
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,919
And this map, along with
Blood's key and locket,

478
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,599
is the only way to
get close to them.

479
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,999
Good work, Number Two.

480
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,559
What does it say about
location of Blood's key?

481
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,639
Right.

482
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,919
Something, something.

483
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,559
"Finest wooden teeth."

484
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,046
That is not helpful.

485
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,411
Wait.

486
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,450
There's the name of a city here.

487
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,770
Madrid.

488
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,482
You've got the wrong frog!

489
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,851
Hey, hey, hey!

490
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,799
It's Constantine.

491
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,525
- What?
- He's back.

492
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,319
What are you doing?

493
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,359
I'm not Constantine.
My name is Kermit.

494
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,040
Constantine, always with the jokes!

495
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,609
Good old Constantine. Always
trying to pull a fast one.

496
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,121
Old friend.

497
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,679
Since you are back,

498
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,359
I guess you are in charge
of prison again.

499
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,519
Here, take prison crown.

500
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,759
We have to readjust it again.
Sergei, you get on that.

501
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,405
Take, take.

502
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,967
Thank you.

503
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,211
Wait a minute.

504
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,359
I've known Constantine for years.

505
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,599
And he has never...

506
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,759
Ever...

507
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,039
Said, "Thank you."

508
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,403
Because I am not Constantine.

509
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,479
- How dare you?
- He's not Constantine!

510
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,639
Let's throw him
in the recycling compacter!

511
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,171
Yeah!

512
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,679
Throw him in the compacter!

513
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,879
But I'm already green!

514
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,206
Squash that frog!

515
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,365
Put the frog down.

516
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,487
Or I will deploy.

517
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,399
Where am I?

518
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,759
The Gulag.

519
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,199
A gulag?

520
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,448
Gulag. The Big House.

521
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,759
The Big House!

522
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,007
Hit it, boys.

523
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,920
<i>This is Russia's premier
state-funded hotel</i>

524
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:43,204
<i>We're very proud
of our eclectic clientele</i>

525
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,725
<i>Excellence in service since 1932</i>

526
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,279
<i>Don't believe what you read
in the online reviews</i>

527
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,919
<i>It's the Big House
The perfect getaway</i>

528
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,959
<i>Welcome into the Big House</i>

529
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,559
<i>You'll never get away</i>

530
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:06,005
<i>It's no Hilton or no Hyatt
But you will have a riot</i>

531
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,485
<i>So please enjoy your stay</i>

532
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,527
<i>Here's the dining room
The menu is minimal</i>

533
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,879
<i>What the cook does
to the food is criminal</i>

534
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,639
<i>Pull up a seat, frog</i>

535
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,729
<i>Grab yourself a stool</i>

536
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,679
<i>May I recommend</i>

537
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,599
<i>You try our famous gruel?</i>

538
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,839
<i>In the Big House</i>

539
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,119
<i>You'll never be alone</i>

540
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,879
<i>Life ain't bad in the Big House</i>

541
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,759
<i>No, froggy, no</i>

542
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,159
<i>Check out after 10</i>

543
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,647
<i>Or 11 years</i>

544
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,124
<i>Make yourself at home</i>

545
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,371
<i>Accommodation here is far superior</i>

546
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,279
<i>Than anything else</i>

547
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,639
<i>You Will find in Siberia</i>

548
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,439
<i>Let me know if
there's anything you need</i>

549
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,319
<i>Everything is free</i>

550
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,599
<i>Money back, guaranteed</i>

551
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,519
<i>In the Big House</i>

552
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,519
<i>You will not survive</i>

553
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,759
<i>When you arrive in the Big House</i>

554
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,407
<i>Run for your life</i>

555
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,879
<i>Two, three, four</i>

556
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,399
<i>It's the Big House
The perfect getaway</i>

557
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,799
<i>Welcome into the Big House</i>

558
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,759
<i>You'll never get away</i>

559
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,450
<i>For your security</i>

560
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,250
<i>I'll keep the only key</i>

561
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,449
<i>Now, please enjoy your stay</i>

562
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,399
Listen, I'm telling you,
you've got the wrong frog!

563
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,559
If you are not Constantine,
why do you have that mole?

564
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,559
It's not real. Someone
glued it to my lip.

565
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:08,359
As far as authorities are
concerned, you are Constantine.

566
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,449
Glue or no glue.

567
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,759
Make yourself comfortable.

568
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,919
You're going to be here a while.

569
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,719
I wouldn't be so sure.
My friends will be here soon!

570
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,285
Now, lights out!

571
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,962
Turn them back on!
I can't see anything.

572
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,199
You have to wait until I'm,
like, out of the hallway.

573
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,925
It's figure of speech.

574
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,279
Okay.

575
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,919
It seems that Blood's key
is hidden in a marble bust

576
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,399
of his accomplice,
Godfrey the Unknown,

577
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,639
which is kept in the Statue
Room at the Prado Museum.

578
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,799
Perfect.

579
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,319
We break in, steal the bust,
destroy it and grab key.

580
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,039
Yeah, it's not that simple.
You see, no one knows

581
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,759
what Godfrey the
Unknown looked like.

582
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,885
Of course not. He was second
in command, so no one cared.

583
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,479
And there's 250
statues in that room.

584
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,844
That may be problem.
Let me think, Number Two.

585
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,359
<i>Excusez-moi</i>, Kermie.
Do you have a moment?

586
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,800
Kermit.

587
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,639
I just wanted to say
that I accept your apology

588
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,319
and I'm ready to put
our little disagreement

589
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,759
or whatever it was, behind us.

590
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,399
And, perhaps, I was a little
too eager about our wedding...

591
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,559
Pig, I have question.

592
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,003
Am I wearing sign
that says "Bother Me"?

593
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,567
What was that? What was that?

594
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,479
I was in the middle
of evilly plotting.

595
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,479
I do not like to be interrupted
while evilly plotting.

596
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,879
If we're to get away with this,
you've got to keep up appearances.

597
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,999
I am keeping up appearances.

598
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,879
If you want the Crown
Jewels, stick to the plan.

599
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,050
Do whatever the pig wants. Keep her
happy. Whatever she asks of you.

600
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,570
Stupid frog!

601
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,846
Stupid train!

602
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,490
I don't want to talk
to you, Kermit.

603
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,679
I said, I want you out!

604
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,959
I don't think you
know what you want.

605
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,239
Yeah, I do. I just told you, I...

606
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,399
You're my lady

607
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,239
and I'm your man, baby.

608
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,839
And that's why,
if you stick with me,

609
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,964
I can give you what you want.

610
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,804
<i>Baby, stop right there</i>

611
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,079
<i>Let me clear the air</i>

612
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,251
<i>Baby, look into these eyes
Let me apologize</i>

613
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,479
<i>I know what you're thinking of</i>

614
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,079
<i>You're thinking,
"Where's the love?"</i>

615
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:43,279
<i>Babe, the love ain't gone
It's here where it belongs</i>

616
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,519
<i>I know what you're waiting for</i>

617
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,559
<i>Well, you don't need
to wait no more</i>

618
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,879
<i>I can give you anything you want</i>

619
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,279
<i>Give you anything you need</i>

620
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,960
<i>I'll make your dreams come true</i>

621
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,839
<i>Give you anything you want</i>

622
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,039
<i>Fulfill your fantasies</i>

623
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,359
<i>I'll make your dreams come true</i>

624
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,399
<i>You want a unicorn
I'll give it to you</i>

625
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,679
<i>You want a puppy dog
I'll give it to you</i>

626
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,879
<i>You want an ice cream cone
I'll give it to you</i>

627
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,999
<i>You want a mortgage loan
I'll give it to you</i>

628
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,119
<i>You want a satin pillow
I'll give it to you</i>

629
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,439
<i>You want an armadillo
I'll give it to you</i>

630
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,559
<i>You want a diamond ring
I'll give it to you</i>

631
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,079
<i>You want a thingy-thing
I'll give it to you</i>

632
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,966
<i>I know what you're waiting for</i>

633
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:35,359
<i>Well, you don't need
to wait no more</i>

634
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,559
<i>I can give you anything you want</i>

635
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,039
<i>Give you anything you need</i>

636
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,119
<i>I'll make your dreams come true</i>

637
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:49,451
<i>Give you anything you want
Fulfill your fantasies</i>

638
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,045
<i>I'll make your dreams come true</i>

639
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,964
<i>- I'm singing
- Cockatoo</i>

640
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,049
<i>- Yeah
- Kangaroo</i>

641
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,279
<i>In Malibu</i>

642
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,479
<i>I'll give it to you</i>

643
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,599
<i>I'll make your dreams come true</i>

644
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,639
<i>- Cockatoo
- Cockatoo</i>

645
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,599
<i>- Kangaroo
- Kangaroo</i>

646
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,719
<i>In Malibu</i>

647
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,481
<i>I'll make your dreams come true</i>

648
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,919
Kermie.

649
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,282
You are what I've always wanted.

650
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,999
Excuse us.

651
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,159
But we are all wondering, what's
the set list for tomorrow, chief?

652
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,199
I don't care. Do whatever you want.

653
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,319
What?

654
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,806
Is he serious?

655
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,479
Kermit, could I do
indoor running of the bulls?

656
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,719
Sure, Zongo. Who cares?

657
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,599
Wow! Thank you, Kermit!

658
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,479
Kermie, if he can do his thing,
why can't I sing my five songs?

659
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,239
Well...

660
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,279
You can. Who cares?

661
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,279
We don't have time
for all this stuff.

662
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,839
We're up to a three-hour
show, Kermit.

663
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,886
You are forgetting one thing,
small man with glasses.

664
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,199
I can give you what you want.

665
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,599
All right!

666
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,399
Okay. Indoor running the bulls.

667
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,887
Won't the show be terrible? Guys?

668
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,481
I'm so confused.

669
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,399
Where are you guys?

670
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,922
Looks like I'm gonna have to
break out of here myself.

671
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,279
It's The Muppet Show,

672
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,211
<i>with our very special
guest star, Lynn Redgrave.</i>

673
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,286
Yes!

674
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,407
<i>Hi-ho! Kermit the Frog, here.</i>

675
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,719
Hi-lo.

676
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,084
Kermit the Frog here.

677
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:10,919
<i>The lovers, the dreamers and me</i>

678
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:17,366
<i>The lovers, the dreamers and cheese</i>

679
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,322
Nailed it.

680
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,359
It's <i>El Muppet Show</i>,

681
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,279
with our very special guest,
Salma Hayek.

682
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,244
Hey!

683
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,919
- Would you look at that?
- No.

684
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,610
Good idea.

685
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:23,319
Yes! Hello and welcome
to <i>El Muppet Show</i>.

686
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,559
Please welcome our opening
act, the Great Gonzo

687
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:31,207
and the indoor running
of the bulls!

688
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,403
Gonzo? Gonzo, I don't
want to do this.

689
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,279
What? This is gonna be great.

690
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,559
Are you sure about this?

691
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,331
Nope. Come on. Let's go.

692
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,519
- Where have you been?
- On stage.

693
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,767
Why did the...

694
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,799
The bulls are out of control!
Who could have foreseen this?

695
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,679
Me. I did.

696
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,042
Here they come again!

697
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,399
Okay. Sorry about that, folks,

698
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,128
but now put your hands
together for Miss Piggy.

699
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,439
I don't believe it.

700
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,759
They've managed the impossible.
What an achievement!

701
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,119
Bravo! Bravo!

702
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,479
What? You mean you actually
like this show now?

703
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,445
No! They've made the show
even worse!

704
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,609
- Bravo! Bravo!
- Amazing!

705
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,159
Where is it?

706
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,079
It's got to be here somewhere.

707
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,079
Keep smashing, Number Two.

708
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,679
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm smashing.

709
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,848
Where is that key?

710
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,927
The last one. It better be in here.

711
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,802
He looks a little bit
like you, Number Two.

712
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,239
Colonel Blood's key.

713
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,965
Nice of him to label it.

714
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,727
- So, where is the locket?
- There's more.

715
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,439
Of course. That's where
Blood's locket is.

716
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,999
In the vaults of the
Irish National Bank.

717
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,445
Then I know where Muppet
tour must stop next. Dublin.

718
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,489
Drum solo!

719
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,799
A standing ovation?

720
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,479
I am Kermit.

721
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,411
I hope you enjoyed my show.

722
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,719
I love you, Madrid!

723
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,367
Wow, what an audience!
Great show, Kermit!

724
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,206
They loved me, Kermie!
They loved me!

725
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,559
Guys?

726
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,359
I'm not sure that was
such a great show.

727
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,919
Like, what are you talking about?

728
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,199
That jam was, like, totally epic.

729
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,479
Exactly.

730
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,239
And I'm glad to say
the Spanish reviewers

731
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,639
disagree with you as well, Walter.

732
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,079
They loved us.

733
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,319
Five out of five <i>jamón serranos.</i>

734
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,359
Those reviews really came out fast.

735
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,399
And Citizen Kane only got
four <i>jamón serranos.</i>

736
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,479
And more good news.

737
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,719
Pack up, everyone. I've booked
our next gig. In Dublin.

738
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,919
Oh, great! Now we all
have time to rehearse.

739
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,919
Rehearse? Let's celebrate.

740
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,039
Yeah!

741
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,599
Yes! You deserve it, comrades!

742
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,804
Go do whatever you want.

743
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,245
Looks like we are busted.

744
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,119
Exactly what are we doing today?

745
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,719
I am doing my job.

746
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,039
All we need to do is look at the map
with the blinky lights, and wait.

747
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,919
This is how it is
done here in Europe.

748
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,719
In America, we use 3-D
satellite LED displays.

749
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,571
Not cardboard with Christmas
lights stuck through it.

750
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,963
A blinky light!
She is blinking! Let's go.

751
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,519
What is this? A toy?

752
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,999
This is my car, Le Maximum.

753
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,728
It is illegal now in most of
the EU for its massive size.

754
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,606
It's so needlessly
spacious, I feel guilty.

755
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,166
I hate Europe.

756
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,244
<i>Madrid, here we come!</i>

757
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,959
- Get out of the way.
- Stay on the road!

758
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,571
Interpol!

759
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,240
Watch out, everyone!

760
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,842
37 hours. Not bad.

761
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,199
The Lemur. I knew it.

762
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,679
This doesn't make any sense.

763
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,479
Why break in,
smash some priceless busts

764
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,439
and then not steal anything?

765
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,399
There must be something
bigger going on.

766
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,519
But what?

767
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,879
I've got it!

768
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,731
Sorry. 2:00 PM. My day is over.

769
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,559
Wait. Those weirdos, the Muppets,

770
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,639
were performing next to the
crime scene in Berlin.

771
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,679
And here they are,

772
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,479
performing right next to
the crime scene in Madrid!

773
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,479
You know what that means.

774
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,799
- Yes, they love museums!
- No!

775
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,999
They're suspects!

776
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,959
Okay. Overtime.

777
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,639
We must find these Muppets
before they flee the country.

778
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,330
To the train station!

779
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,080
Hey, Larry, want a
bite of my bocadillos?

780
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,166
What the...

781
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,930
Are you all <i>Les Muppets?</i>

782
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,964
Wow, those are big badges!

783
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,885
Thank you.

784
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,482
Come, come. You must come with
us to answer some questions.

785
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,839
<i>Kermit, let's begin
Describe the day you played Berlin</i>

786
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,079
<i>We rehearsed,
and then we walked about</i>

787
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,679
<i>We ate bratwurst and sauerkraut</i>

788
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,479
<i>That night at 10:03</i>

789
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,759
<i>Were you inside the
portrait gallery?</i>

790
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,079
<i>My alibi is watertight</i>

791
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,408
<i>The audience saw me sing all night</i>

792
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,639
<i>Monsieur, we know you did the crime</i>

793
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,799
<i>I was on stage that whole time</i>

794
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,079
<i>Ask who sang Rainbow Connection</i>

795
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:11,090
<i>Thank you, Kermit,
no more questions</i>

796
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,879
I think it's time for
good cop/romantic cop.

797
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,162
<i>Miss Piggy, you could
end up locked inside</i>

798
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,999
<i>And now's your chance
to save your hide</i>

799
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,919
<i>Gentlemen, I did not know</i>

800
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,359
<i>It's a crime to steal the show</i>

801
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,439
<i>Tell us how the art was taken</i>

802
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,919
<i>If you want to save your bacon</i>

803
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,759
<i>I haven't seen your missing art</i>

804
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,119
<i>All I've stolen is audience hearts</i>

805
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,519
<i>We'll catch the swine</i>

806
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,239
<i>That did this job</i>

807
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,719
<i>Give up the pig puns, creep!</i>

808
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,799
<i>Go jump in a lake,
that's my suggestion</i>

809
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,844
<i>Thank you, Piggy, no more questions</i>

810
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,559
I think she likes me. Huh?

811
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,239
I don't think your puns are
helping the investigation.

812
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,079
<i>- You know, I think they did it
- No, they didn't</i>

813
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,799
<i>Yes, they did and we can pin it</i>

814
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:53,879
<i>If they did how did they do it?</i>

815
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,959
<i>If they didn't how did they didn't?</i>

816
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,239
<i>If they didn't then it's easy
'cause they simply didn't do it</i>

817
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:01,839
<i>If they did it, then I knew it but
we've nothing that can prove it</i>

818
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,041
Excuse me.

819
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,679
<i>Let's go from the start</i>

820
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,839
<i>What do you know
about the stolen art?</i>

821
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,239
<i>I didn't know there was a plan</i>

822
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,519
<i>Your accusation's far out, man</i>

823
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,282
<i>The chances of us committing
a crime are less than .009</i>

824
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,649
<i>I can do an Elvis impression</i>

825
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,404
<i>Thank you, Muppets
No more questions</i>

826
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,519
<i>- They didn't
- No, they didn't</i>

827
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,639
<i>There's no way they did the crime</i>

828
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:40,039
<i>- They couldn't, they're too stupid
- Not criminal masterminds</i>

829
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,999
<i>We do not know who did it
But we know who didn't do it</i>

830
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,279
<i>So we know who didn't do it</i>

831
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,041
<i>Yes, we know who didn't do it</i>

832
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,921
They're incapable
of being culpable!

833
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,599
Hi!

834
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,007
Come on. Let's go
over the files again.

835
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,563
Stop digging escape tunnel, frog.

836
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,199
How did you know?

837
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,528
It's the first escape
everyone tries.

838
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,527
That's the second
escape people try.

839
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,360
Oh, boy.

840
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,041
Third way!

841
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,039
Give up, frog.

842
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,359
I have Netflix account

843
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,959
with search keywords
"prison escape."

844
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,999
I have seen every
prison movie ever made.

845
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,009
Even the ones in space.

846
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,399
Yeah, well... Hey, wait a second.

847
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,359
That's them! That's my friends!

848
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,607
What happened to them?

849
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,039
"Dominic Badguy.

850
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,079
"An interview with
the brains behind

851
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,759
"the Muppets' triumphant
comeback world tour."

852
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,961
What?

853
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,719
It seems your friends
do not need you anymore.

854
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,839
They have forgotten about you.

855
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,565
No, no, no.

856
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,728
They wouldn't.

857
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,599
They couldn't.

858
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,999
We're a family.

859
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,079
"Family"?

860
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,159
No one believes in family
in the Gulag, frog.

861
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:35,160
People are only
ever out for themselves.

862
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,559
Listen, Kermit.

863
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,839
We have annual lighthearted
Gulag Revue coming up.

864
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,359
It is that, or they riot.

865
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,483
I thought you might help me.

866
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,559
The thing is, Nadya,

867
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,319
I'm sort of done doing that,
but thanks for the offer.

868
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,839
This is not offer. This is prison.

869
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,479
You are going to help me.

870
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,319
Rehearsals tomorrow, 4:00 AM.

871
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:06,444
Or I put you on The Wall.

872
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,879
"The Wall"?

873
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,606
Why would I be afraid of a wall?

874
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:21,370
Just direct the show.
You'll never escape.

875
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,521
What time did you say
that rehearsal was?

876
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,519
Okay. What about
this comedian bear?

877
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:42,645
He is too stupid to be stupid.
He must be some sort of genius.

878
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:47,685
Maybe your "Lemur"
hunch is correct.

879
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,999
Except for the fact
that <i>Les Muppets</i>

880
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,079
play tomorrow night
at the Dublin Theatre.

881
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:58,959
Which just happens to be next
door to the Irish National Bank!

882
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,288
Maybe your Muppet hunch is...

883
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,199
Correct.

884
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,159
It's almost as if we're...

885
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,679
Not so different

886
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,927
after

887
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,445
all.

888
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,439
Come, come, <i>mon ami!</i>

889
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,199
We must follow <i>Les
Muppets</i> to Dublin!

890
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,606
To Dublin!

891
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,086
Kremlin!

892
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,727
Putin!

893
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,290
No, what are you doing?

894
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,959
- Okay, number five, baby. Blow.
- Come on.

895
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:37,239
- There you go. You know the routine.
- Come on, Diddy Daddy!

896
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,568
Hey, guys? Fellas?

897
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,210
Whoa, man!

898
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,891
Hey, did you see that?

899
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,726
Do you guys think that Kermit's
been acting a little weird lately?

900
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,804
No.

901
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,489
You're probably right.
It's just me.

902
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,321
Bad frog.

903
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,720
Enough!

904
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,039
You're all terrible.

905
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,925
Fix this. Or it's The Wall.

906
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,121
Of course.

907
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,319
Guys...

908
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:34,359
It's always good to start with
an up-tempo song and dance

909
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,119
and then go into a comedy routine.

910
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,079
But we like Boyz II Men!

911
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:41,919
It is Big Papa's favorite song. Lot
of emotions in that song for him.

912
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,199
I'm not learning no other song.
I'm a triple threat!

913
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,210
A singer, a dancer and a murderer!

914
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,239
There you go. How do you like that?

915
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,519
Drum solo! Drum solo!

916
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,039
When do I do the indoor
running of the bulls?

917
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:56,839
What about the band's
marathon jam session?

918
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,999
Four or five musical numbers.

919
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,639
Quiet!

920
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,639
Now, look! We are holding
auditions tomorrow.

921
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,479
And if any of you
have a problem with that,

922
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:09,526
any of you,
then my door is always open!

923
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,959
Thank you, Kermit.

924
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,561
This is what we've all
been waiting to hear.

925
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,839
Teach us, Kermit.

926
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,850
We will do whatever frog say.

927
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,923
Put it there.

928
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,639
Good night, frog. Nice work today.

929
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,039
Thanks, Nadya.

930
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:38,165
Even if your friends don't
need you, we certainly do.

931
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,681
Good night.

932
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,239
- Good night, Big Papa.
- 'Night, Nadya.

933
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,479
- Good night, Carl.
- Good night, Nadya.

934
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,959
- Good night, Prison King.
- Good night, Nadya.

935
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,279
- Good night, Skullcrusher.
- Good night.

936
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,087
- Good night, Danny Trejo.
- Good night, Nadya.

937
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:00,679
<i>No one believes in family
in the Gulag, frog.</i>

938
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:04,282
<i>People are only
ever out for themselves.</i>

939
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,121
Well, well, well.

940
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,084
What's he up to?

941
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:16,921
Gentlemen.

942
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,599
I need this review
to go into Friday's paper.

943
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,599
Super positive. Five stars.

944
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:26,247
I won't be paid off for a review.
I'm a journalist.

945
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,002
I'm joking, of course.
Cash or credit?

946
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:33,721
- What was that?
- Rats.

947
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,804
Who cares?

948
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,199
Hand these tickets out to
anyone who will take one.

949
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,999
In fact, you may have to
actually pay people to come.

950
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,639
It's the Muppets.
It's not gonna be easy.

951
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,046
And I want a standing ovation.

952
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,399
Oh, dear.

953
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:55,002
Where does he keep
all those suitcases?

954
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,926
Let's see here.

955
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,283
What's Kermit doing on the
cover of this newspaper?

956
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,731
Dominic's the bad guy!
Dominic's the bad guy!

957
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:17,999
Fozzie!

958
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,039
Dominic's the reason we've
been selling out our shows!

959
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,599
He's been giving away tickets

960
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,199
and bribing journalists
to write great reviews!

961
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,846
Why didn't we ever
think of doing that?

962
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,879
I mean, that's terrible!

963
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,439
The question is, why?

964
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,039
And could it have
anything to do with

965
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:38,199
why Kermit's been
acting so weird lately?

966
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,359
Hey, wanna see something funny?

967
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,799
Yes, Constantine, the world's
most dangerous frog.

968
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,959
Fozzie, what does he have to
do with what I just told you?

969
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,811
Nothing, but check this out.

970
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,090
Look, it's Kermit.

971
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,366
What did you do with Kermit?

972
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,251
Wait a minute.

973
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,087
Fozzie...

974
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,319
What if Kermit has been replaced

975
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:05,444
by this Constantine guy?

976
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:10,762
Nah, that's impossible.
We'd all notice!

977
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:12,841
Wouldn't we?

978
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,601
Kermit?

979
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,409
Are you there?

980
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,999
Hello?

981
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,440
Kermit?

982
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,319
Everything's fine.
Let's get out of here.

983
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,965
Wait!

984
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,408
We should look around.

985
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,641
Kermit's got a big bomb collection.

986
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,239
Looks like he's planning some
sort of comedy heist bit.

987
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,408
I hope not. Those never work.

988
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,485
What's that?

989
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:59,919
Oh, no.

990
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,645
What, what, What? What?

991
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,805
Oh, no.

992
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,327
- We got to get out of here!
- Yeah!

993
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,919
Not so fast.

994
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,119
Where's Kermit?

995
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,399
What do you want?

996
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,924
You have wocka-ed
your last wocka, bear.

997
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,839
- Bad frog!
- Animal!

998
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:36,159
- Oh, good boy!
- Great job!

999
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,600
Thank you.

1000
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,079
Quick! The freight train!

1001
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,486
Go, go, go!

1002
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,559
We got to go back! Warn the others!

1003
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,759
I tried. They didn't believe me.

1004
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:02,679
It's our word against his and,
well, he's fooled them all.

1005
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,519
Should we go to the police?

1006
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:06,359
We don't have any evidence!

1007
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,319
I feel terrible.

1008
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:11,759
I'm the one who talked Kermit into
doing this tour in the first place.

1009
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,248
I wish Kermit was here!
He would know what to do.

1010
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,359
You're right.

1011
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:21,199
There's only one guy in
this world who can save us.

1012
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,159
Only one frog who
can restore order,

1013
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,999
bring justice,

1014
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,248
and set things right!

1015
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,599
You are talking about
Kermit, right?

1016
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,484
Yes, Fozzie. Kermit.

1017
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,199
Good!

1018
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,561
Great!

1019
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,289
That's it, guys, that's it!

1020
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,240
That's good, guys! Come on!
And hit it hard!

1021
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:51,759
Okay. All right. Yes.

1022
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,086
Nadya?

1023
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,485
I think perhaps we should,
perhaps, keep it prisoners only.

1024
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:02,199
Of course. I just love Broadway.

1025
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:05,847
But you are right, Kermit, as ever.

1026
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:09,322
Okay. Thank you.

1027
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,121
Okay, fellas, listen up.

1028
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,290
Here's who made the cut.

1029
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:17,450
Sergei! King! That's you.

1030
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:24,125
You are always right, my
beautiful amphibian prince.

1031
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,965
I will never let you go.

1032
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,851
This is better.

1033
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,679
What's wrong? You only ever
knit when you're stressed.

1034
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:42,759
The bear,

1035
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:47,759
the little guy and their
dog, they are onto us.

1036
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,883
They got away.

1037
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,882
How are we gonna spin this?

1038
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:03,279
Comrades, I'm afraid
I have bad news.

1039
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:08,202
Walter and Fonzie
have quit the Muppets.

1040
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:09,719
Wait.

1041
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,639
You can quit the Muppets?

1042
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:14,319
Wait a second.
Walter quit the Muppets?

1043
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,879
We just did a whole movie
where he joined the Muppets.

1044
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,719
Yeah, we sure spent a
lot of time on it.

1045
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:20,799
I'll say.

1046
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:25,130
Maybe even at the expense of other
long-standing, beloved Muppets.

1047
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,605
Come on, Robin.

1048
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,599
Coming.

1049
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,879
Well, as the old saying goes...

1050
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,890
The show must continue,

1051
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,363
- in a timely fashion.
- Wait.

1052
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,319
Fozzie and Walter are
part of our family.

1053
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,719
We can't let them
go without a fight.

1054
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,039
Right, Kermit?

1055
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,999
I know this is hard, Gonzo.

1056
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,239
Walter and Fonzie
were my best friends.

1057
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:50,441
Kermit...

1058
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,559
Are you sure you're okay?

1059
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,079
Yes, I'm fine, pig.

1060
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,248
I could never lose you.

1061
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,039
You complete me.

1062
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,399
Kermie.

1063
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,919
Guys, come on!

1064
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,199
This is gonna be fantastic.
We should be celebrating!

1065
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:06,961
Yes. Remember, I can
give you what you want.

1066
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,960
- Yeah?
- Yeah, right.

1067
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,486
- I'll keep that in mind.
- Say, has anyone seen Animal?

1068
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,728
Does anybody else feel like
we're traveling in circles?

1069
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,931
There it is!

1070
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,241
Finally!

1071
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,761
Do you have evidence
to frame the bear?

1072
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,170
Excellent.

1073
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,646
Where are the guards?

1074
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,281
Stay here. I'm going
to check on the vault.

1075
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,047
Stop it!

1076
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:44,879
Colonel Blood's locket.

1077
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,890
Of course. Now grab it.

1078
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:49,999
Shawn.

1079
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,565
Someone's coming. Abort!

1080
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,488
I think I just saw something. It's
headed back towards the theater!

1081
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:11,639
- That was close.
- Too close.

1082
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:14,127
We need to move to
final phase three. "Wedding."

1083
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:22,530
Hey, Kermit, you can't go out there.
It's Piggy's Celine Dion number.

1084
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,719
Did you see anything?

1085
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:32,439
Not a thing. It is my lunch hour.
It lasts six hours.

1086
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:33,971
Excuse me.

1087
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:36,559
Ladies and gentlemen!

1088
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,759
I have an announcement!

1089
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,007
What?

1090
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,041
Kermit,

1091
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,759
I'm in the middle of a song here!

1092
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,159
Miss Piggy.

1093
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:49,599
I have very important
question for you.

1094
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,041
Yeah? What are you doing?

1095
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:57,123
Do you wish to become Mrs. Piggy?

1096
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,126
Or rather, Mrs. The Frog?

1097
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,519
Kermie, I thought you'd never ask.
I really thought you'd never ask!

1098
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,039
So?

1099
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:07,730
What do you say?

1100
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,159
It's beautiful.

1101
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,489
Yes! Yes! Of course! Yes!

1102
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:15,730
I can't believe this!
After all this time,

1103
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:18,442
it was finally just so easy!

1104
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:22,799
That's right, folks,
it's the Muppet wedding

1105
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,559
the world has been waiting for.

1106
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:27,559
We're putting our tour on hold...

1107
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:28,799
What?

1108
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,999
to be married in two days' time

1109
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,119
at the world's most
romantic location,

1110
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:37,130
the Tower of London.

1111
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,639
<i>Here's a Muppet newsflash.</i>

1112
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,639
<i>The years of waiting are over.</i>

1113
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:46,159
<i>The biggest "Will they,
won't they?" of all times</i>

1114
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,999
<i>has been answered
with a firm, "They will. "</i>

1115
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,399
<i>Kermit the Frog and Miss
Piggy are to be married!</i>

1116
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,524
<i>That's right, folks. They're
finally tying the knot.</i>

1117
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:01,439
Well, at least they didn't
get the pot of gold.

1118
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,483
No, they did not.

1119
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,205
I have never been to a more
ridiculous crime scene.

1120
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,159
The comedian bear, he was here.

1121
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,647
The Lemur. He, too, was here.

1122
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:19,839
Could the comedian bear and the
Lemur be one and the same?

1123
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:23,199
The comedian bear is the Lemur.
That is brilliant.

1124
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:26,079
But why would he steal
a bunch of old bones?

1125
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:29,519
The bones apparently belonged
to one Colonel Thomas Blood.

1126
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:33,359
He was the only man to ever nearly
steal the Crown Jewels of England.

1127
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:36,679
Wait! Where did the frog say
he was getting married?

1128
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,239
The Tower of London.

1129
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,879
The comedian bear
is planning on stealing...

1130
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,119
- The Tower of London!
- The Crown Jewels!

1131
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,924
The Crown Jewels.

1132
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,719
Sir, where would you
like the flowers?

1133
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,319
Who cares?

1134
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,399
Hey, chief.

1135
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,719
Hi-lo.

1136
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,559
We've all been thinking, and...

1137
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:11,479
Well, after you and
Miss Piggy get married,

1138
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,879
what's gonna happen to the tour?

1139
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,399
And to us?

1140
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:19,199
Well, now you guys have
all the freedom you want.

1141
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,639
You don't need me.

1142
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,569
I'm done with Muppets.

1143
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:28,923
But, hey, it's been
a good run, right?

1144
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:32,409
Good luck.

1145
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,081
Kermit!

1146
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:38,569
Did he just say what
I thought he said?

1147
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:43,803
What are we gonna
do without Kermit?

1148
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,047
The only thing we can do.

1149
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:51,088
Pack up, go to the wedding,

1150
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:54,161
and head back home.

1151
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,879
Foo Foo, it's always been a fight.

1152
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:06,644
But this is so easy,
it just doesn't feel right.

1153
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,079
<i>This is my dream come true</i>

1154
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:14,519
<i>The day has come for
us to say "I do"</i>

1155
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:17,479
<i>There's nowhere else I'd rather be</i>

1156
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:20,799
<i>Nothing in the world means
more to me than you</i>

1157
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,399
<i>I've waited so patiently</i>

1158
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:26,919
<i>I knew you were the
only frog for me</i>

1159
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:29,479
<i>Always knew this day would come</i>

1160
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:33,159
<i>It's written in the stars
It's destiny</i>

1161
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:37,359
<i>So how can something so right</i>

1162
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:42,566
<i>Feel so wrong tonight?</i>

1163
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:49,999
<i>After all we've been through</i>

1164
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,842
<i>Why do I feel I don't know you?</i>

1165
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,599
<i>We'll settle down
and start a family</i>

1166
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:02,282
<i>Have a mini you and a mini me</i>

1167
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:07,161
<i>A little pink frog and
a little green piggy</i>

1168
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,451
<i>They'll learn to say hello
and say goodbye</i>

1169
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:11,887
<i>We'll grow gray and old</i>

1170
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,448
<i>And live the quiet life</i>

1171
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:18,161
<i>Just you and I</i>

1172
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,359
<i>Hand in hand we'll stay together</i>

1173
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:23,479
Hey. Look at that sky.

1174
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,284
<i>Forever and ever</i>

1175
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:31,239
<i>So how can something so right</i>

1176
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:36,970
<i>Feel so wrong tonight?</i>

1177
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:42,251
<i>After all we've been through</i>

1178
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:48,639
<i>Why do I feel I don't know you?</i>

1179
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:51,519
<i>How can something so right
feel so wrong inside?</i>

1180
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,439
<i>How can something so good
leave me feeling so bad?</i>

1181
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,119
<i>How can my dreams coming true</i>

1182
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:57,719
<i>Leave me lonely and blue?</i>

1183
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:00,519
<i>How come the happiest day
of my life is so sad?</i>

1184
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:03,559
<i>How can I feel the high
when I feel so low?</i>

1185
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:06,519
<i>After all we've been through
After coming so far</i>

1186
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:08,449
<i>Is this my destiny?</i>

1187
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:11,559
<i>Where is the love that's written</i>

1188
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:15,924
<i>In the stars?</i>

1189
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:21,041
<i>How can something so right</i>

1190
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:28,325
<i>Feel so wrong tonight?</i>

1191
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:35,599
<i>After all we've been through</i>

1192
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:40,010
<i>Why do I feel I don't</i>

1193
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:43,282
<i>Know you?</i>

1194
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,524
Oh, Kermie.

1195
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,168
- Hey, the show's starting.
- Yeah!

1196
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,439
Lady and gentlemen,

1197
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:10,690
good evening and welcome to
the Gulag Annual Revue Show!

1198
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:18,086
Escapo, you're up after the ballet.

1199
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:19,925
Okay.

1200
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,159
Kermit! Kermit!

1201
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:25,441
Kermit.

1202
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:30,039
Fozzie. Walter. Animal.

1203
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:31,799
We're here to rescue you.

1204
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,359
Yes! And we've got to go right now!

1205
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:34,686
Yeah!

1206
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:49,879
Hey!

1207
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:52,079
I can't believe you're here.
It's so good to see you guys!

1208
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,159
Kermit, listen.

1209
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,119
An evil frog named Constantine

1210
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,599
has taken over the Muppets
and replaced you!

1211
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,399
What? Constantine replaced me?

1212
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:00,479
Yeah.

1213
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,728
And he was working
together with Dominic.

1214
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:06,570
They're planning something
terrible, but we don't know what.

1215
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:08,839
But...

1216
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:12,159
How could you not have noticed
that he'd replaced me, Fozzie?

1217
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,639
He looked like you
and he talked like you.

1218
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,679
Okay, he didn't talk that much
like you, come to think of it.

1219
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:18,279
But he said he had a cold.

1220
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,479
Animal know.

1221
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,079
"Animal know"?

1222
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,879
You mean, all this time, I've
been locked in a Russian gulag,

1223
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,039
no one, not one single person

1224
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:28,719
from the Muppets except Animal

1225
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:31,605
noticed I'd been replaced by
an evil criminal mastermind?

1226
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:34,119
It sounds worse than it was.

1227
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:37,403
No. It's as bad as it sounds.

1228
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:43,282
I thought you guys
had forgotten about me.

1229
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,439
That you didn't need me anymore.

1230
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:49,919
We'd never forget about you.

1231
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,479
We need you more than ever, Kermit.

1232
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,887
Good frog.

1233
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:58,999
Late extra! Late extra!
Read all about it!

1234
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,407
Kermit and Miss Piggy
to be married in London!

1235
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,601
What?

1236
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:07,281
Piggy?

1237
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:10,810
Piggy's gonna marry the world's
most dangerous frog tomorrow?

1238
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,959
Piggy and the gang are in danger!

1239
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,079
To London!

1240
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,805
No. Kermit!

1241
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,439
Oh, yeah, I forgot. I'm in a gulag.

1242
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:21,599
Sorry about that, Ivan!

1243
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,919
It's okay!

1244
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:25,879
No problem, Kermit.
It's easy mistake.

1245
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,559
Right. Thanks for not shooting me!

1246
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:30,279
Sure. No problem...
Hey, nothing personal.

1247
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,639
We have to escape, guys. Tonight!

1248
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,171
But how?

1249
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,806
Kermit.

1250
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:37,599
Do you know where these prop
pickaxes and shovels

1251
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,919
are supposed to go
for this big mining number?

1252
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,485
Wait!

1253
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:43,599
I've got it!

1254
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:47,771
And now, folks, the Great Escapo!

1255
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,080
Oh, no, you don't.

1256
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:07,079
Nice try, Escapo.

1257
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:08,799
I sure hope this works, Walter.

1258
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,479
I have tried a lot of ways
to get out of here.

1259
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:13,279
This is gonna work, Kermit.
I'll see you on the outside.

1260
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,399
Okay!

1261
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,840
Gosh, I hope this works.

1262
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:19,239
Thank you, thank you,
everybody. And now,

1263
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:23,081
we're going underground.
Working in the coal mine!

1264
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,605
- Bravo! Bravo!
- Bravo!

1265
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,565
Oh, no.

1266
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:39,201
Kermie!

1267
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,639
I can't believe that worked!

1268
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,399
We did it! Great work, guys!

1269
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,359
Now put the pedal to the metal.
We have a wedding to crash!

1270
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,686
Yeah!

1271
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,807
That's a nice venue.

1272
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,959
The main entrance is
too well-guarded.

1273
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,811
I'm gonna need to get in
some other way.

1274
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:18,609
Here you go.

1275
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:21,599
You're the new guy?

1276
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:22,959
Yes, I am.

1277
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,279
Next time, wear a uniform.

1278
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:25,481
Right.

1279
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:35,599
Wow, Kermit, you were like
James Bond back there.

1280
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,559
Thanks, Fozzie. Okay, listen, guys.

1281
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:39,399
Walter, you and Animal
go look in the chapel.

1282
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:40,479
Right.

1283
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,719
- Fozzie, come with me.
- Yes, sir.

1284
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:45,082
- Good luck, guys.
- You, too, Kermit.

1285
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,519
Piggy?

1286
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,290
Where is she?

1287
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:56,249
Kermit, these are your clothes.

1288
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,399
This tuxedo is too tight.

1289
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,887
Someone's coming! Hide! Hide!

1290
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,205
Which room am I supposed to be in?

1291
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,730
Here it is.

1292
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:10,642
I hate weddings.

1293
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:43,126
What the...

1294
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,159
There you are.

1295
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,999
Well, don't just stand there
gawping, Number Two.

1296
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,599
Come in.

1297
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:54,681
Let us take this convenient
opportunity to review our plans.

1298
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:58,679
Once you've stolen the Crown
Jewels and framed the Muppets,

1299
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:02,199
ring the tower bell five times and
we will rendezvous on the roof.

1300
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:03,999
But what will you do
when you're married?

1301
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,679
Because the pig will
know everything.

1302
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:08,531
Once she's served her
purpose, kaboom.

1303
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,928
It will be bacon for breakfast.

1304
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:17,719
Champagne fridge delivery.

1305
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:20,924
Put it over there on
the bear-skin rug.

1306
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,279
Thank you!

1307
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,164
It's show time.

1308
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:32,079
Fozzie, are you okay?

1309
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:34,999
Yeah, I think so. How do I look?

1310
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,599
You look fine. You look fine.

1311
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,359
Come on, we have to
go rescue Miss Piggy!

1312
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:39,639
Right! Let's go!

1313
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:42,319
The Lemur! I have you finally!

1314
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,839
And Constantine, the world's
most dangerous frog!

1315
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:45,919
No, no, no.

1316
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:49,639
As you might say, case sol-ved!

1317
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:53,287
Perfect! Time for my annual
eight-week paid vacation.

1318
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:55,279
No, wait!

1319
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,799
What am I supposed to do with them
until the mobile holding unit arrives?

1320
01:20:58,800 --> 01:20:59,879
On holiday!

1321
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,479
No, you've got the wrong frog.

1322
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:03,409
And stay there!

1323
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:11,242
And so you know, Number Two,
I have hired us help.

1324
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:14,999
The world's smallest team
of jewel thieves.

1325
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,679
Babies, meet your new boss.

1326
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:23,319
Genius, I know! Who would suspect
babies of stealing Crown Jewels?

1327
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:26,285
Look at their sweet faces.

1328
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:29,759
Let's see. Where am I seated?

1329
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,486
I'll need an usher.
Usher? Is there an usher?

1330
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:35,719
Yes. I'm the Usher.

1331
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,279
Pig or frog?

1332
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,519
What do you think?

1333
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:40,079
I don't know, man. Pig?

1334
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,839
No. Frog. I'm related
through marriage.

1335
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:44,280
What kind of an usher are you?

1336
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:08,999
You're up, little dudes.

1337
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,565
Go, go, go.

1338
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:17,607
Down.

1339
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,041
Tip.

1340
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:28,801
Come on! What the...

1341
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:36,046
Dominic. Hey, Dominic.

1342
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:37,561
Shut up.

1343
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:43,447
The wedding, it's starting.

1344
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,569
She looks beautiful.

1345
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,079
Fozzie, we got to do something.

1346
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:52,239
This is so frustrating!

1347
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,839
Wow, would you look at that?

1348
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,610
Now that's a poorly made car.

1349
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:57,807
Let's get out of here!

1350
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:30,159
I'm just happy for them.
Really happy for them.

1351
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:32,886
- Would you please stop talking?
- Okay.

1352
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:47,846
Dearly beloved...

1353
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,322
What! Code Red! Code Red!

1354
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,559
Oh, come on.

1355
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,519
- Not a laser web.
- Pretty.

1356
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:03,359
Right. Go and get
the suspend-y ropey thing.

1357
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,799
- And my really cool skintight outfit.
- Yep.

1358
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:07,959
Shawn, come back from vacation!

1359
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,839
Constantine and the Lemur
have escaped.

1360
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,724
The Crown Jewels are in danger!

1361
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:33,119
We are gathered here today
to witness the union

1362
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:36,399
of this pig and this frog

1363
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:41,003
in Holy Matrimony
before the presence of God.

1364
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:10,999
Do you, Kermit the Frog,

1365
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,329
take Miss Piggy to be
your lawfully wedded wife,

1366
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:17,839
in sickness and in health,
so help you God?

1367
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,839
Yes. Yes, I do.

1368
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:22,839
And do you, Miss Piggy,

1369
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:26,799
take Kermit the Frog to be
your lawfully wedded husband,

1370
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:30,163
in sickness and in health,
so help you God?

1371
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:32,761
I...

1372
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,081
I...

1373
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,439
Just say "I do."

1374
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,483
This is what you've
always wanted, right?

1375
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:46,679
I do?

1376
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:48,319
I'm sorry, is that a question?

1377
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:50,488
No, it was not a question.

1378
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,199
We have to do something, guys.

1379
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:56,159
Kermit, we've got to get
you close to Miss Piggy!

1380
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:58,044
What does this do?

1381
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:04,959
- What the...
- Piggy, it's me, Kermit.

1382
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,919
Come on, we have to get out
of here! The wedding is off.

1383
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:08,239
Oh, wow!

1384
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:11,125
Like, I kind of knew
he'd get cold flippers.

1385
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:15,086
Excuse us.

1386
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:18,679
No, Kermit! What are you doing?

1387
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:20,799
- Piggy, I will explain later.
- I cannot believe...

1388
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,479
Come here, frog!

1389
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:23,806
Where you going?

1390
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,199
I'm sorry, my dear, forgive me.

1391
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:29,279
What is going on at my wedding?

1392
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:30,925
- Gotcha!
- What?

1393
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:33,279
Animal, pull!

1394
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:35,599
What is happening here?

1395
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,879
Catch froggie! Catch froggie!

1396
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:40,279
Well, this is the best
Muppet wedding ever!

1397
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:42,847
Piggy, listen!
That's not me! I'm me!

1398
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:46,288
He's Constantine, the
world's most dangerous...

1399
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:56,929
Two Kermits?

1400
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:59,039
Well, that explains a lot.

1401
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:02,159
How can there be two Kermits?

1402
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:05,439
Of all the ways to ruin a wedding,
this has got to be the most creative.

1403
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:06,639
Two Kermits!

1404
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:09,279
No, just one Kermit. Me.

1405
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,719
No, no, no. Do not listen to him!

1406
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:13,719
I am the real Kermit.

1407
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:15,759
That's ridiculous!
I am Kermit the Frog!

1408
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,159
No, I am Kermit the Frog!
Hi-lo, Kermit the Frog, here.

1409
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:19,519
"Hi-lo?" It's "Hi-ho!"

1410
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:21,006
Would every Kermit be quiet!

1411
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:24,519
Well, there's only one
sure way to settle this.

1412
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:25,721
First Kermit.

1413
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:30,319
Will you marry me?

1414
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,759
Yes, of course, let's go!

1415
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:35,159
The helicopter is waiting, my love!

1416
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:37,886
And you, the other Kermit...

1417
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:41,159
Will you marry me?

1418
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:43,479
Well, I mean, I...

1419
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:45,999
I would. I mean, I could. It's...

1420
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,850
That's my Kermit!

1421
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:51,161
That's our frog!

1422
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:53,686
Kissy-kissy!

1423
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:06,211
That is right, Muppets!

1424
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:09,564
I am Constantine,

1425
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:13,719
the world's most dangerous
frog and number one criminal!

1426
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:19,882
And a thousand times more
frog than this Kermit person!

1427
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:22,999
And now,

1428
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:27,762
I have only one thing
to say to you fools!

1429
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,130
Good night, folks!

1430
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:37,279
What is that?

1431
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:38,759
It's a bomb!

1432
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:42,719
This is where my patented magnetic
bomb-attractor vest can aid us,

1433
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:45,207
that Beaker is
conveniently wearing.

1434
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:53,122
What? What's going on?

1435
01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:00,410
Wait! Miss Piggy's
ring is the bomb!

1436
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:05,159
Some of you guys grab Piggy,
and some of you guys grab me.

1437
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:06,441
Pull!

1438
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:19,922
That's only 800 years old.

1439
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,210
Nicely done, Beaker!

1440
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,919
Kermit! Help!

1441
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:37,159
- Piggy!
- Help!

1442
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:38,599
She's on the roof!

1443
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:42,009
Shut up and keep moving, pig!
You are my insurance policy!

1444
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:46,399
Number Two, you look ridiculous.

1445
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,119
Why are you wearing that?

1446
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:49,799
Because I am the Lemur.

1447
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:52,439
And the world's
new number one criminal.

1448
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:53,559
That's right.

1449
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:55,239
This is where I double-cross you.

1450
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:57,159
First rule of double-cross.

1451
01:29:57,160 --> 01:30:00,479
You don't announce the double-cross
before you double-cross.

1452
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:03,331
It's not even a rule
because it is so obvious.

1453
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:11,119
The Lemur is literally the worst
bad guy name I have ever heard!

1454
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:12,321
Let's go!

1455
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:17,999
Oh, no!

1456
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,119
He's getting away!
What are we gonna do?

1457
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:22,049
I'm gonna stop that helicopter.

1458
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,319
We're coming! Hang on, Miss Piggy!

1459
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,045
Jump!

1460
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,159
Shut up, pig!

1461
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:31,479
Kermit!

1462
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:32,679
We have to do something!

1463
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:33,759
I got it!

1464
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,639
There's only one way
we can reach him up there!

1465
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:37,001
Muppet Ladder!

1466
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:40,411
- What the...
- Kermit!

1467
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:43,846
Come on up, Chef!

1468
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:46,409
Watch the hair, bear.

1469
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:49,679
Give up, Constantine.
I've got you now!

1470
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:52,247
Bad move, frog.

1471
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:53,879
Kermit!

1472
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:56,439
Okay, Kermit, we're
coming to get you.

1473
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:57,641
Now!

1474
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:01,879
No, something's wrong.

1475
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:03,605
We're not moving.

1476
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:10,243
You're ruining my getaway!

1477
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:15,719
Hang on, Piggy! I'm coming!

1478
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:17,490
Go get 'em, Kermit!

1479
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:20,241
Kermie!

1480
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,799
Welcome aboard, Kermit.

1481
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:26,719
You don't know who
you're dealing with.

1482
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:29,287
I am the world's
most dangerous frog.

1483
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:31,079
Oh, brother!

1484
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:33,319
You may be the world's
most dangerous frog,

1485
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:34,885
but you're still a frog!

1486
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:40,919
No one tricks me into marrying them

1487
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:44,806
and then hurts my Kermie!

1488
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:53,159
What a woman!

1489
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:54,879
Yeah. My woman.

1490
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:57,924
And I believe this belongs to you.

1491
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:07,439
Well, I'm sorry I
ruined your wedding.

1492
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:09,165
Oh, Kermie.

1493
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:12,402
I'm so glad you did.

1494
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:22,766
Okay. Can we get down now?

1495
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:24,326
We did it, guys!

1496
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:28,919
What an action sequence!

1497
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:30,439
You sure look pretty, Miss Piggy.

1498
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:31,799
Thank you.

1499
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:35,319
Congratulations, weirdos,
you've saved the Crown Jewels!

1500
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:37,639
And you've caught my
nemesis, the Lemur.

1501
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:40,079
Look at his little costume.
That's adorable!

1502
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:42,159
- I'm not adorable.
- He is adorable.

1503
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:43,479
You're adorable!

1504
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:44,959
Did you make that kitty-cat outfit?

1505
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:48,403
The bad guy is Dominic Badguy!

1506
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:53,369
Well, <i>mon ami</i>, I guess
this is where we say goodbye.

1507
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:56,286
You go your way, and I go mine.

1508
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:59,439
Here comes the rain. Oh, boy.

1509
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:01,439
And I said I wasn't
going to do this.

1510
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:03,839
Pull yourself together, man.
Stop crying.

1511
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:06,930
We're only saying
our final farewell.

1512
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:10,639
Goodbye forever!

1513
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:12,159
I'm going to miss you so much!

1514
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:15,045
I'm going to miss you,
my French friend.

1515
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:17,731
Whenever you're ready.

1516
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:19,560
- Yes.
- Yes, of course.

1517
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:22,279
- Take them away!
- Take them away!

1518
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:24,359
- Thank you.
- <i>Au revoir</i>, Muppets.

1519
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:26,801
- Bye-bye.
- See you!

1520
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:28,839
<i>You're number two</i>

1521
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:30,039
- Sam.
- Shut up.

1522
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:31,480
Sam! Wait for me!

1523
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:39,879
You know, I missed
all of you so much.

1524
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:41,839
There he is, right there!

1525
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:44,679
Arrest him! Arrest that frog!

1526
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:46,719
Nadya? Wait. For what?

1527
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:50,399
For leading the largest mass
break-out in Gulag history.

1528
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:53,719
You will get 30 years. Maybe 50.

1529
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:56,400
- But“
- No "buts," Kermit.

1530
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:01,319
You didn't finish Gulag Annual Revue,
and you didn't even say goodbye.

1531
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:02,719
- What?
- What?

1532
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,999
You are coming with me. Now, move!

1533
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,039
Fellas, listen. Easy.

1534
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:09,607
No, no, no! Kermit!

1535
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,530
Wait!

1536
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:16,079
We're sorry, Kermit.

1537
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:18,080
We're sorry that we didn't
notice you were missing.

1538
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:20,399
We're sorry we didn't
tell you often enough

1539
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:23,126
how much you mean to all of us.

1540
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:27,090
We're sorry we ever
took you for granted.

1541
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:33,199
But that's never going
to happen again.

1542
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:37,405
Because if Kermit has to
go back to the gulag,

1543
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,449
you'll have to take me, too.

1544
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:43,279
No.

1545
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:48,202
You're my best friend, Kermit.
Wherever you go, I go.

1546
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:51,642
You'll have to take me, too.

1547
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:53,641
And me.

1548
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:57,962
Kermit, we convinced ourselves
that evil frog was you

1549
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:00,879
because he gave us
what we thought we wanted.

1550
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:02,923
When what we really wanted...

1551
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:04,799
What we really needed...

1552
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:06,799
Was you, Kermit.

1553
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:10,925
The actual, real you.

1554
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:23,002
It would appear you
were right, Kermit.

1555
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:26,129
I guess this is your family.

1556
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:33,810
And families belong together.

1557
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:37,966
You are free to go.

1558
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:39,806
Forever.

1559
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,559
Kermit, did you hear that?
We're free!

1560
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:45,919
Nadya, thank you! Great!

1561
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,770
That's wonderful!

1562
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,486
Wait!

1563
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,319
Hey, guys, listen. We still
have to finish our world tour.

1564
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:57,919
And I know where we
need to play next.

1565
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:59,679
For one night only,

1566
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:01,723
Siberia, Russia!

1567
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:07,204
Yes, yes! I'll pack my
swimsuit right away!

1568
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:10,519
Wonderful!

1569
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:13,883
It's terrible. You will hate it.
You will hate it.

1570
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:24,999
Okay, guys, this is it.
The Gulag Finale!

1571
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,159
Here we go!

1572
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:28,488
A-one, two, three, four!

1573
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:34,359
<i>Together again, again</i>

1574
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:38,770
<i>Gee, it's good to be
together again, again</i>

1575
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:43,279
<i>I just can't imagine
that you've ever been gone</i>

1576
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:47,159
<i>It's not starting over
It's just going on</i>

1577
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:49,639
<i>Together again, again</i>

1578
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:50,719
<i>Now we're here</i>

1579
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:54,679
<i>And there's no need
remembering when</i>

1580
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:58,726
<i>Because no feeling
feels like that feeling</i>

1581
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:01,399
<i>Together again</i>

1582
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,921
<i>Again, again, again</i>

1583
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:08,999
<i>Together again, again</i>

1584
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:13,285
<i>Gee, it's good to be
together again, again</i>

1585
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:16,839
<i>I just can't imagine
that you've ever been gone</i>

1586
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:18,559
<i>It's not starting over</i>

1587
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:20,399
<i>It's just going on</i>

1588
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,439
<i>Together again, again</i>

1589
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:23,679
<i>Now we're here</i>

1590
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:26,451
<i>And there's no need
remembering when</i>

1591
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:30,487
<i>'Cause no feeling feels
like that feeling</i>

1592
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,559
<i>Together again</i>

1593
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:33,807
<i>Again</i>

1594
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:53,879
<i>I just can't imagine
that you've ever been gone</i>

1595
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:57,919
<i>It's not starting over
It's just going on</i>

1596
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:59,639
<i>Together again, again</i>

1597
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:04,079
<i>Gee, it's good to be
together again, again</i>

1598
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:07,921
<i>'Cause no feeling feels
like that feeling</i>

1599
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:11,719
<i>Together a-...</i>

1600
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:15,481
<i>Together again!</i>

1601
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,443
Okay, Nadya, this is it. Your solo.

1602
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:39,927
<i>Kermit!</i>

1603
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:02,446
Oh, boy.

1604
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:05,486
- Hey, pull the rope!
- Oh, right.

1605
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:11,283
This cast is really heavy.

1606
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:13,039
Rowlf, come here.
Come here, come here.

1607
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:14,119
Yeah, what do you got there?

1608
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:15,367
Take this.

1609
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:21,367
You should have negotiated
a smaller font size.

1610
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:36,759
I believe I may have
something that could help.

1611
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:40,199
This is my automated
end-crawl operating machine.

1612
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:44,803
All I have to do is push this button
and it will crawl all by itself.

1613
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:52,050
Let's try this.

1614
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:57,211
Another qualified success.

1615
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:54,486
Check this out.

1616
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:08,689
You can go home now, Ma.
The movie is over.
