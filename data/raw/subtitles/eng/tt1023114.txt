1
00:01:47,700 --> 00:02:04,200
THE WAY BACK

2
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,970
Look at those poor men.

3
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,550
They've got night blindness.

4
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,640
I saw it in the transit camp.

5
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,650
It's vitamin deficiency from starvation.

6
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,680
Here, here.

7
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,140
You planning on surviving
on half rations, son?

8
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,260
Look, he's an old man.

9
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,890
I'm an old man.

10
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,440
I'll be alive in the morning.
He won't.

11
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,520
Kindness.

12
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,400
That can kill you here.

13
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,610
He's American.

14
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,290
In Here? How?

15
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,290
Stalin hates foreigners,

16
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,830
and that includes Poles.

17
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,500
You're Polish, no?

18
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,670
Uh-huh.

19
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,630
I like you Poles.

20
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,460
Your burning sense of injustice,

21
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:46,140
the yearning for freedom.

22
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,640
Khabarov... Andrei Timofeyevich.

23
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,840
Weiszczek... Janusz.

24
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,690
Your charge, may I ask, Janusz?

25
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:59,230
58-10.

26
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,030
A spy.

27
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,020
That's what they told me.

28
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,520
Ten years?

29
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,570
No. 20.

30
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,700
58-14. Sabotage. Ten years.

31
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,030
And you were on Soviet side of line,

32
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,710
and they arrest you.
They accuse you of spying.

33
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,170
Torture you, huh?

34
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,710
Did you sign confession?

35
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,200
No.

36
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,910
No, I wouldn't sign,

37
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,250
so they... they tortured someone else.

38
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:30,060
Forgive me.

39
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,220
I was actor.

40
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,760
Moving pictures.

41
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:38,520
In my last picture,
I played aristocrat.

42
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,850
They arrested me when the film
was released.

43
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,400
Why?

44
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,190
It was claimed

45
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:49,740
I was elevating the status
of the old nobility.

46
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:53,290
So you got ten years
for a performance in a film.

47
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,790
I've had better notices.

48
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,920
Nyet.

49
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,600
The Urki.

50
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,440
Do you know who these are?

51
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:28,110
Professional criminals.

52
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,440
Murderers and thieves.

53
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,450
Don't stare at them.

54
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,950
The guards let them run things in here,

55
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,580
and they are to be feared.

56
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,410
Then why would they
let them run things?

57
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,490
Because they are byproduct of
bourgeois society

58
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,580
and so friends of people.

59
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:49,790
We are political prisoners and
so enemies of people.

60
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:53,350
The Soviet Union
has become one vast prison.

61
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,420
Slave labor.

62
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,640
They are from far reaches of
Soviet Empire,

63
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,020
all caught up in same net.

64
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:06,270
And, uh, do any of them
wriggle out of the net?

65
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,400
No, Janusz. You must be more careful.

66
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,700
Stalin has eyes and ears everywhere,

67
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,280
even in here.

68
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,290
If you are not more careful,

69
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,540
you will die after one year.

70
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,210
If not literally,

71
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,300
then spirit.

72
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,050
And how long have you been in here?

73
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,880
Eleven months and 29 days.

74
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:17,510
You do for me.

75
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,210
You want me to draw you?

76
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,390
No. Not me.

77
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,420
Lice?

78
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,250
Eating me alive.

79
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,250
For that I have old folk remedy. Come.

80
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,640
The mine.

81
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,690
They blast at night.

82
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,100
What are you doing?

83
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:59,440
We must be quick.

84
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,940
Or this will not be
here in the morning.

85
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,370
You're going to
leave it here overnight? Why?

86
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,030
You'll see.

87
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,970
It can be done.

88
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,670
I know a way through the wire.

89
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,130
How?

90
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,090
Lazar, my associate,

91
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,180
he is overseer of construction.

92
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,480
He showed me.

93
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,310
If you ever escape the camps,

94
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,440
and I've been waiting
so long for someone like you,

95
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,620
someone with the strength,

96
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,820
the will to see it through.

97
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,820
But to go where?

98
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,000
I mean, we can't go west.

99
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,790
I mean, apart from the Germans,
there's the Soviets.

100
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,370
And east,
all Soviet right to the Pacific.

101
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,000
No, no, no, no.

102
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,670
North. Have to be... have to be south.

103
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,470
Correct.

104
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:06,170
But do you know where we are?
I mean, exactly?

105
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:13,100
I believe we are about 500 kilometers
north of Lake Baikal.

106
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,350
This is the lake.

107
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,850
Camp is here.

108
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,690
And the border is here.

109
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,850
We could follow the edge
of the lake here.

110
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,730
That runs due south.

111
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,190
Exactly. Then we cross the
Trans-Siberian Railway

112
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,820
to the Mongolian border and freedom.

113
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,570
Spring is already upon us.

114
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,240
We will have to wait till autumn.

115
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,540
No. Why wait?

116
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,580
Why?

117
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:38,380
Because it is a thousand kilometers
to the border, maybe more.

118
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,000
We need careful planning.
We need to stockpile food.

119
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:44,580
I've already begun trading, dealing.

120
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,420
You must do the same.

121
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:49,220
And in autumn,
the weather is more predictable.

122
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,190
We can use the new snow
to cover our tracks.

123
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,610
And we bring my friends.

124
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,560
Your friends? You trust them?

125
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,180
Of course.

126
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,070
They won't all survive.

127
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,150
But they will die free men.

128
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,700
Free.

129
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,680
That's a really brave man!

130
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,470
First we need big branches!

131
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,520
One on each side
and then one on the back!

132
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,810
Help me, Kazik.

133
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,740
These down there,
put it there on the branch.

134
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,310
Yes, yes.

135
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,900
Follow me. We'll both go like this.

136
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,030
What?

137
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,400
Good.

138
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,450
Yes. Put it there.

139
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,170
Zoran! Your blanket!

140
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,670
For a wind break.

141
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,460
Get in. Come on.

142
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,040
Come!

143
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,500
Please come with us! We have shelter!

144
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:15,820
I am Zoran, Yugoslav. That's Janusz.

145
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,530
And he's Kazik.

146
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,610
Horodinsky.

147
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,780
They are Polish.

148
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:23,950
Voss. I'm Latvian.

149
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,030
It's a League of Nations.

150
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,330
And you are?

151
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,540
Smith.

152
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,170
And your first name.

153
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,540
Mister.

154
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,290
Mr. Smith.

155
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,800
That's right.

156
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,580
Might as well have shot us yesterday.

157
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:15,160
We're for the mines.

158
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:41,440
These collars same as used by
ancient Egyptian people.

159
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,400
Yes, but on their horses, probably.

160
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:47,280
No. No, no, no. Same for people.

161
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,700
How do you know?

162
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:51,080
I was professor of Egyptology,

163
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,780
Leningrad University.

164
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,640
Are you crazy? They'll shoot you.

165
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,270
I've got to get out of here.

166
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,850
I have to get back.

167
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,980
I have to get back.

168
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,950
It can be done.

169
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,410
What can be done?

170
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,740
He knows a way through the wire.

171
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,750
He has a plan.

172
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,170
Shh. Who has a plan?

173
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,840
His name is Khabarov.

174
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,380
The actor.

175
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,930
Do you know him?

176
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,970
He has no intention of escaping.

177
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,050
What do you mean?

178
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,850
He's a liar.

179
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,520
He's been here for years.

180
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,860
Seeks out new arrivals.

181
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,980
Me, when I first came here.

182
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,860
He just likes to talk about escape.

183
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,650
I've known others like him.

184
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,860
Why should I believe you?

185
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:50,240
Nothing is for nothing in the camps.

186
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:54,410
From you he gets your energy,
your spirit.

187
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,660
You feed his dream of escape.

188
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,540
You help keep him alive.

189
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:01,330
He's nothing but a leech.

190
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,710
You are a cold bastard, Mister.

191
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,840
I'm still alive, that's all I know.

192
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:10,220
But I won't be in another six months,

193
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,890
and neither will you. Not here.

194
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,310
Not in these mines.

195
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:24,610
But if you are serious...

196
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,570
really serious about
making a run for it...

197
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,240
I'm with you.

198
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,370
I thought you were a loner.

199
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,540
It can't be done alone.

200
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:41,740
Besides, you have a... a weakness.

201
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,210
You could be useful to me.

202
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,040
And what is that?

203
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,090
Kindness.

204
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,760
If anything happens to me,

205
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,800
I'm counting on you carrying me.

206
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,590
Khabarov.

207
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,720
Khabarov, come.

208
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,850
What?

209
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,100
Come with me. Now.

210
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,230
What is it? What? What?

211
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,310
Come. Look at this.

212
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,730
Look at this.

213
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,610
We can go. We can go tonight.

214
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,650
The storm will cover our tracks.

215
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,280
No, no, no. What are you talking about?
It's a passing storm!

216
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,570
No, it's enough.

217
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,150
Janusz, that is impossible.

218
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,490
We need... We need detailed preparation,

219
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,120
we need plans, we need maps.

220
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,290
No, no,
the timing will never be perfect.

221
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,080
Look, they won't expect it now.

222
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,500
Are you crazy?

223
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,420
What about the distances, huh?

224
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,750
It's, it's a thousand kilometers,
and we need food.

225
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,330
Plenty of food.

226
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,760
But, but we have food. You have food.

227
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,340
Look, the American is with us.

228
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,140
We've been trading, just like you said.

229
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,470
How long will that last?

230
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,850
Look, I've spent half my life

231
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,140
In the woods and mountains.

232
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,970
We can live off the land.

233
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:44,140
You don't understand.
You are too young.

234
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,190
It cannot be done.

235
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,310
What else is there?

236
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,480
You hear me?

237
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,610
To stay here and die?

238
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,230
It cannot be done.

239
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,160
Andrei!
How do we get through that wire?

240
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,320
I don't know
what you are talking about.

241
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,360
Your friend Lazar...

242
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,950
I mean, he knows, doesn't he?

243
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,660
You told me that.

244
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,100
Piss off now.

245
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,820
You can't see, can you?

246
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,520
Please don't leave me behind.

247
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,150
Promise me, Andrejs.

248
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,410
I can hold onto
your shoulder by night.

249
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,910
I can... I can see shapes.

250
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,710
By day I can see just fine.

251
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:46,380
I won't hold you up.

252
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:50,540
Please don't tell the others.

253
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:54,220
In here, I die.

254
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,990
Swiss.

255
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,790
There are no secrets here.

256
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,460
What do you want?

257
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,960
The game goes against me.

258
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,080
Small debt, they take fingers.

259
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,790
Big debt, they take head.

260
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,090
Me, big debt.

261
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:22,800
But I never gambie my Wolf.

262
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,350
In forest, you need knife,

263
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,970
and I need miracle. Get me out of here.

264
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:51,260
Come on! Come on!

265
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,100
Look! Keep going. Keep going!

266
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,520
We must keep going! Get up!

267
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:56,070
Get up!

268
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,890
Activity, or we die right now.

269
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:00,230
You know how fast the dogs are.

270
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,950
Run, damn you!

271
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:04,400
Mister, come on, look at me.

272
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,740
Is it time for me to carry you?

273
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,030
Come on. Come on.

274
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,490
Come on!

275
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:17,590
Janusz, we can't see anything!

276
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,540
The snow is blinding us!

277
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,300
Janusz!

278
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,350
I need your knife!

279
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,940
Give me the knife!

280
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,860
Your knife!

281
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:51,280
Janusz, we must take shelter!

282
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,660
We can't go on!

283
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,790
Don't you see? This is perfect!

284
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,460
They'll never find us like this.

285
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,700
Never!

286
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:33,280
You stare at me like snake at rabbit.

287
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,490
He teach me English.

288
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,990
Speak good, huh?

289
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:43,380
Bread for words, wasn't it, cowboy?

290
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,380
How far have we come?

291
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:49,010
Maybe 20, 30 kilometers.

292
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,560
That's all?

293
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,630
Less, if we've been going in circles

294
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,560
like chicken without head.

295
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:58,980
All right, let's see what we have.

296
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,980
Everyone, come on.

297
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:05,900
We share everything.

298
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,530
And you?

299
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,650
What?

300
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,360
Do you have?

301
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,910
And that coat.

302
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,370
It's not your coat.

303
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,500
That is Khabarov's coat.

304
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:25,830
Yes, he gave me.

305
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:26,960
And...

306
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,890
Huh? Huh?

307
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,060
See?

308
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,100
He was going to inform.

309
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,060
Don't worry. I talk to him.

310
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,480
Everything okay.

311
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,910
You've made a bargain with the devil.

312
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,240
You realize that?

313
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,750
Do you have a knife?

314
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,420
For direction he uses grass
and the mosses. What's that?

315
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,550
I swear to God
he better know what he's doing.

316
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,810
You should be grateful
you're here at all.

317
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,760
Grateful is for dogs.

318
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:31,610
What... What's that?

319
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,280
Wolves. It's only wolves.

320
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:36,030
Only wolves.

321
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:41,510
South.

322
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,020
To Lake Baikal.

323
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:53,360
You are the Pakhan.

324
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:54,490
Am I?

325
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,690
What is a Pakhan?

326
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,540
Boss of Urki.

327
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,830
We are not criminals.

328
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,200
We are escaping from criminals.

329
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,700
I have been watching you.

330
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,540
And I swear to God you win my respect

331
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,710
with your sticks and pine cones.

332
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,210
I'll come between you and death.

333
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,510
So you want to be my bodyguard?

334
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,090
It's the Urka way.

335
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:22,100
You have me, and you have the Wolf.

336
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:24,050
Huh?

337
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,560
Janusz,
how long till we get to the lake?

338
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:27,730
How long?

339
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,600
Three, four weeks.

340
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,480
Maybe more.

341
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,750
I have us here somewhere.

342
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:46,740
And down here,
the Trans-Siberian Railway,

343
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,080
and the border of Mongolia.

344
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,290
Mongolia seems so far away.

345
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,090
Mongolia? I go more.

346
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,420
To America.

347
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:03,430
It's like this...
we have food for another week.

348
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,930
We have no more matches.

349
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,060
But still we have Khabarov's flint.

350
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,610
We need meat.

351
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:11,770
I can make traps.

352
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:14,270
We'll be moving
too fast to wait for traps.

353
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,820
We find farms,
villages, get food there.

354
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:20,120
Look, there's a bounty on our heads.
Remember that.

355
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,910
We steal it. At night.
They never know.

356
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,450
We are not thieves.

357
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,290
Then I'll steal it, and I'll eat.

358
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,460
You can watch.

359
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,580
What is that?

360
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,880
Barbed wire.

361
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,800
He's making a fish-hook.

362
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,260
That's how we will survive.

363
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,130
With fish?

364
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,300
Uh.

365
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,090
But I don't eat fish.

366
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,170
Then you'll die.

367
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,470
Come on,

368
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,970
we need to make a fire.

369
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,470
Come on, lots of wood.

370
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,350
It'll be 40 below tonight.

371
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,400
Tomasz?

372
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:08,660
No, no, not too much, not too much.

373
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,090
Kazik?

374
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,390
Kazik?

375
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,890
He's still out, looking for wood.

376
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,230
He has night blindness.

377
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:38,270
Kazik!

378
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:38,940
Kazik!

379
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:55,120
Janusz!

380
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,390
Janusz!

381
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,440
Professor.

382
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,070
I came from the mine to find you.

383
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,160
I thought I was alone.

384
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,950
I've been walking with you
for some time.

385
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,660
I'll... I'll just sit for a minute.

386
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:30,090
Not far to go.

387
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,070
We made it.

388
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:44,190
We really made it.

389
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,660
Isn't that something?

390
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:44,210
Lord, take this
innocent soul into thy keeping.

391
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:49,760
Amen.

392
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:52,130
A free man died here today.

393
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,020
Still, one less mouth to feed.

394
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,900
What?

395
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:29,980
They'll find our bones
and your drawings

396
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:32,110
a hundred years from now

397
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:36,690
and say "Look,
a fine example of Early Gulag Man."

398
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:39,150
Shut up with your jokes.

399
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:41,000
Go and find food like the others do.

400
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,950
You do the shutting up!

401
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,660
Drawing all day
like you're on holiday.

402
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:45,960
I'm sick.

403
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,160
I cook. They find food.

404
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,340
What do you ever do?

405
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:52,340
Nothing.

406
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:54,790
But I make you all laugh.

407
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:57,100
No, not anymore, you don't.

408
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:25,990
So...

409
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:30,580
who will be first?

410
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,260
What do you mean, first?

411
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,210
The first to die.

412
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:37,260
I think the artist.

413
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:40,560
But better if it was him,
the funny man.

414
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,220
Why better if it's Zoran?

415
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:46,890
More soft.

416
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:50,070
More... tender.

417
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,020
Mister only catch little fish now.

418
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,030
We must have meat, or we die here.

419
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,360
You're the Pakhan,
you've thought of it.

420
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,160
We all have.

421
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:04,910
That's why you brought extra people,
isn't it?

422
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:05,870
For food?

423
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,750
No, no, no.

424
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,420
We will get more food
when we get to Lake Baikal.

425
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:11,290
There will be plenty of fish there.

426
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:15,220
You said we would have
seen lake a week ago.

427
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,590
Huh?

428
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,630
We're lost, Pakhan.

429
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:12,470
Raah!

430
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:14,430
Yaah!

431
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:19,980
Yaah!

432
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,410
Yaah! Yaah!

433
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:54,220
Look, if I, uh, if I find the lake,

434
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,190
I will be back in a week.

435
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:03,240
If I don't, well, you're on your own.

436
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,360
I know.

437
00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:10,540
Our friend Valka.

438
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,780
Don't let him out of your sight.

439
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:17,670
Here.

440
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:22,760
Fresh this morning.

441
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,090
Thank you.

442
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:29,800
Good luck.

443
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,940
And you.

444
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:27,430
Janusz!

445
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:29,380
I saw it. I saw it.

446
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:30,800
I saw the Lake.

447
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:31,970
Easy, easy.

448
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:33,470
Three days from here.

449
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,220
Stones! Gather stones!

450
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:36,770
Heat them in the fire!

451
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,780
What is it?

452
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:28,860
Psst. Psst.

453
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:32,320
Pssst. Hey.

454
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:38,370
Someone's been following us.

455
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:42,080
He's behind that dark clump of trees.

456
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:43,580
If he gives us away,

457
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:46,540
they'll be all over us in no time.

458
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:49,470
He's right. We have to do this.

459
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:50,590
No killing.

460
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,930
No?

461
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,720
I think you've killed before.

462
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:57,770
You say too many prayers for
an innocent man.

463
00:51:57,770 --> 00:51:59,390
Valka, you go behind

464
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,350
in case he makes a run for it. Go.

465
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:07,150
Spread out, spread out.

466
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:22,080
Valka, no.

467
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:23,410
No!

468
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:36,300
We... we won't hurt you.

469
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:49,640
Huh.

470
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:50,940
A Polka.

471
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:52,650
Polka? What does he want?

472
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,030
I don't know. It's a girl.

473
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,980
And she's Polish.

474
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,740
She's been following us
for several days.

475
00:52:57,830 --> 00:52:59,410
And what?

476
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,160
Well, she needs food,
you know, protection.

477
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:03,290
She's been too afraid to approach us

478
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,660
until she was sure we weren't Russian.

479
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:07,130
She wants to travel with us?

480
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:09,380
She's on the run, like us.

481
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:11,670
She'll slow us down.

482
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,050
She said she's escaped

483
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:16,220
from a Russian collective farm.

484
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:20,140
I know this type... street gypsies.

485
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:23,310
There are thousands like that,
less use than a dog!

486
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,890
Pakhan, don't do this. Huh?

487
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:29,690
Oh, come on. She's starving.

488
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:31,690
We can barely feed ourselves.

489
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,310
Yeah,
maybe it's kinder to leave her.

490
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:35,490
No, she was sent to us.
We can't leave her.

491
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:39,190
Janusz, we have no choice.

492
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:06,720
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

493
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:08,980
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

494
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:16,400
Stay back.

495
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:18,030
Stay back. Careful of the mud.

496
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:22,330
Easy. Easy. Easy.

497
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,950
Valka.

498
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,880
Here you are.

499
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,310
Find some wood.

500
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:15,870
Her name is Irena.

501
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:48,960
Is the soap ready?

502
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,280
Yes.

503
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,790
Ah, good.

504
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,420
Stir.

505
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:07,010
Well?

506
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,640
What's so funny?

507
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:11,310
Are you...

508
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,560
you are going to the office
this morning?

509
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,040
Valka?

510
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:36,170
Valka.

511
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:37,370
Come on.

512
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:38,800
You're next. Go, go.

513
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,470
Valka, come on!

514
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,060
Now take off your shirt.

515
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:55,430
Why do we do this?

516
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:59,740
So we don't look like
thieves and robbers.

517
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:02,350
Head up.

518
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:07,440
Now, still.

519
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:11,240
Very still, please.

520
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:12,700
Head up.

521
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:15,290
More.

522
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:19,660
Nyet.

523
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:07,130
You know, I, uh,
can't believe she's Polish.

524
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:09,180
She's, uh, she's educated.

525
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:11,300
Speaks good English, French.

526
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:12,970
Is that right?

527
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,970
You don't like her, do you?

528
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:16,640
Speak to Valka about her.

529
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:18,560
He doesn't even think she's Polish.

530
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:19,860
Well, I did speak to him.

531
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:21,600
And the others.

532
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,150
They agree she comes with us.

533
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:27,650
What, you disagree?

534
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:30,780
There's no room for sentimentality,
you know that.

535
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:33,740
Apart from food, she'll slow us down.

536
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,530
No, it won't take our weight.

537
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:06,350
We'll have to swim across.

538
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,400
Can you swim?

539
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:14,910
Yes, Mister.

540
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,490
You wouldn't lie to me.

541
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:17,820
I'm not lying, Comrade.

542
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,870
And don't call me Comrade.

543
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:30,210
Irena, no!

544
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,870
Here, come on.

545
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,330
Here, take the food.

546
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,470
Were your parents arrested with you?

547
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,550
They're dead.

548
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:23,430
We lived on a farm outside Warsaw.

549
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:25,140
When the Russians came,

550
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:26,770
they said we were kulaks

551
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:29,150
and exploiting the peasants.

552
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:33,780
My parents were afraid
and hid me in the barn.

553
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:36,120
I found them later.

554
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:47,120
I...

555
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:54,130
I found them face-down in the mud.

556
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:59,060
They'd been bashed
and strangled with barbed wire.

557
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,810
Later, the Russians caught me

558
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:12,270
and sent me to a collective farm.

559
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:14,780
They were cruel to me.

560
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:17,480
I ran away.

561
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:19,660
I had no food.

562
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:21,780
And then I saw you.

563
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:31,880
You can't swim, can you?

564
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:36,760
What?

565
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:38,510
You've never been near
the water in your life.

566
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,180
But I got across, didn't I?
And you followed.

567
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:44,520
And you said you lived
on a farm near Warsaw?

568
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:45,810
Yes.

569
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,390
Soviets didn't get that far.

570
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:52,020
That was German territory.

571
01:01:52,110 --> 01:01:55,480
Your parents weren't murdered,
were they?

572
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,820
You made all that up.

573
01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:04,410
We've all done
terrible things to survives.

574
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:10,620
But don't ever lie to me again.

575
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:16,590
We've had enough of lies.

576
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:29,270
We have to go around it.

577
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,600
Quicker through it.

578
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:33,560
No, they have dogs.

579
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:36,070
If they raise the alarm,
then we don't stand a chance.

580
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,940
We need food again, Pakhan.

581
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:39,770
Look, I know we need food,

582
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:42,200
but we can't go into
that town and risk arrest.

583
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:43,700
We're wasting time.

584
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:02,760
What is it? What's wrong?

585
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:04,260
Where's Valka?

586
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:05,760
He was behind Zoran.

587
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:07,970
Zoran, weren't you watching him?

588
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:12,150
I'm not his keeper.

589
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,850
Damn him.

590
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:15,940
He could turn us in for the bounty.

591
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:17,240
And risk arrest?

592
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:19,610
He's a gambler.

593
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:22,910
Irena,
do you think he would do that?

594
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,200
He might.

595
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:25,650
We don't need his knife.

596
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:27,660
We can make one out of deer bone.

597
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:29,870
It's an opportunity to get rid of him.

598
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:34,340
All right, all right.

599
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:36,010
Come on, let's go.

600
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:38,300
Watch it funny man?

601
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:39,790
Hey, hey, hey!

602
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:42,470
You want to get us all killed? Hmm?

603
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,970
Hmm?

604
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:48,310
Easy, cowboy.

605
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,180
You tear my coat.

606
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:52,260
Idiot.

607
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:55,820
Idlot? Ha.

608
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,240
Am I?

609
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:59,150
Let's see who is idiot.

610
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:05,360
What?

611
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:06,620
Did I kill?

612
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:09,990
Yes.

613
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,490
A dog.

614
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:14,330
Don't believe me, then don't eat.

615
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:19,210
But you will, won't you,
because you want to survive.

616
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:21,170
I know about survive.

617
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:24,970
All my life.

618
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:27,670
And...

619
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:29,520
it's my birthday.

620
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:33,020
In Russia, that means we drink.

621
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:26,660
She lived in the streets, like me.

622
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:31,200
So the story you told us wasn't true.

623
01:05:31,290 --> 01:05:33,250
I thought that story would be more sad

624
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:35,120
and you wouldn't leave me behind.

625
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,220
My parents were Polish Communists.

626
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:50,930
They took us to live in Soviet Union,
to Moscow.

627
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:53,550
They want to work for the Revolution.

628
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:57,930
We lived in the Hotel Lux,

629
01:05:58,030 --> 01:06:01,140
with lots of foreign Communists.

630
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:07,780
But they arrested them in 1937.

631
01:06:07,870 --> 01:06:09,330
They said they were spies.

632
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:15,120
The people put me in the orphanage.

633
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:16,750
And my brother,

634
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,920
he died.

635
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:21,000
I was ten years old.

636
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:28,510
They called me Rykov,

637
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:36,600
but I remembered our Polish name...
Zielinska.

638
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:42,810
I used to say it every night
before I went to sleep.

639
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,190
So you ran away.

640
01:06:48,620 --> 01:06:49,730
Oh.

641
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,900
They have no mosquitoes.

642
01:07:26,530 --> 01:07:28,150
What can we do?

643
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:29,980
Steal a boat?

644
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,690
No, it's too risky.

645
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:33,900
People are going to get ill.

646
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,030
I know.

647
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,860
Isn't it strange?

648
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,500
After all we've faced,

649
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:42,670
these tiny insects might bring us down.

650
01:07:52,970 --> 01:07:55,180
There it is again.

651
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:56,680
No mosquitoes!

652
01:07:56,770 --> 01:07:57,880
Zoran! Zoran!

653
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:05,570
What's he doing, for God's sake?

654
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:24,040
Mosquito repellent.

655
01:08:27,930 --> 01:08:30,460
So what you say to him?

656
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:32,130
Who?

657
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:33,760
The mosquito man.

658
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:35,590
Ah.

659
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:36,930
I'm an escaped convict

660
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:38,300
who is plagued by mosquitoes.

661
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:39,760
Yeah, very funny.

662
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:41,230
No, really, what did you say?

663
01:08:41,310 --> 01:08:43,020
Come on, man.

664
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:46,060
Clown.

665
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,820
Goodbye, Lake Baikal.

666
01:08:53,910 --> 01:08:55,280
Well done.

667
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:07,460
Mister, did you know Voss is a priest?

668
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:10,160
No, I didn't know that.

669
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:12,340
And Tomasz is a pastry chef,

670
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:13,960
but he wants to be an artist.

671
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:15,630
You don't say.

672
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:18,930
And Zoran was on business in Moscow,

673
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:20,930
arrested in Red Square.

674
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:23,680
He said he was
just taking a photo of the Kremlin.

675
01:09:23,770 --> 01:09:26,310
He's an accountant.

676
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,310
Well, I'll be damned.

677
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,310
I never knew a funny accountant.

678
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:35,320
Don't you talk to each other?

679
01:09:35,410 --> 01:09:39,200
In the camps you learn to say
as little as possible.

680
01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:40,870
Mr. Smith?

681
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,950
Working on the Moscow Metro?

682
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,660
He's an engineer.

683
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:46,490
His father was Finnish.

684
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:49,840
Grew up in America,
but he could speak Russian.

685
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:53,340
And why would an American
move to Russia, for God's sake?

686
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:55,010
The Depression.

687
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:57,350
His son came with him.

688
01:09:57,430 --> 01:10:00,890
What happened to his son?

689
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:02,970
They shot him.

690
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:04,470
He was 17.

691
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,410
The Mongolian border

692
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:16,220
is on the other side of those tracks...

693
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:17,920
maybe four, five days away.

694
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:19,920
Can we cross somewhere else?

695
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:21,500
Here, this is the main line.

696
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,430
It's going to be like this everywhere.

697
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:26,270
He's right. We wait till tonight.

698
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:33,600
What?

699
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:35,150
Nothing. Just looking.

700
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:36,900
Don't look.

701
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:46,110
Valka?

702
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:48,200
What?

703
01:11:48,290 --> 01:11:50,580
Why do you have assholes tattooed
on your chest?

704
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:52,630
I mean, they should be on your ass

705
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:55,130
so you can sit on them
every time you take a shit.

706
01:11:55,130 --> 01:11:56,840
You think it's funny?

707
01:11:56,930 --> 01:11:58,670
They are great men.

708
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:02,680
Whoa, whoa! Valka! Valka!

709
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:05,800
Don't you know what "Stalin" means,
funny man?

710
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:07,680
Means Man-of-Steel.

711
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:09,810
He takes from rich and gives to poor.

712
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:12,180
Yes, of course he does.

713
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:14,310
Then he takes both of them

714
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,270
and puts them in a Gulag for 25 years.

715
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,600
Watch your eyes, crow bait.

716
01:12:59,450 --> 01:13:02,190
Thank you, Mother Russia,
for your hospitality,

717
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,320
but I will definitely
not be coming back.

718
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,560
You know, they'll... they'll catch you.

719
01:13:36,650 --> 01:13:39,560
Yeah. Prison is okay.

720
01:13:39,570 --> 01:13:41,060
Debt is bad.

721
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,740
But there are many prisons,

722
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:43,980
they don't find me.

723
01:13:46,830 --> 01:13:49,690
What about America?

724
01:13:49,790 --> 01:13:53,910
Oh. It's not for me, freedom.

725
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,660
I wouldn't know what to do with it,
I swear to God.

726
01:13:59,670 --> 01:14:06,420
So we must say goodbye, my Wolf and me.

727
01:14:06,430 --> 01:14:09,420
You don't need him anymore.

728
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:18,940
Good luck, Valka.

729
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:20,930
Goodbye, Janusz.

730
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,990
Look. See?

731
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,860
Do you think
we'll get there by tonight?

732
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:12,530
Yes, I think so.

733
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:14,450
What will we do?

734
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:16,660
We will eat.

735
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:17,620
Yes.

736
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:19,200
We will sleep.

737
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,130
We made it.

738
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:52,440
Mister!

739
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:59,820
They're communists.

740
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,750
So it's here too.

741
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:17,930
This changes everything.

742
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:22,180
There's nowhere to hide.

743
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:40,870
It's a Buddhist temple.

744
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,540
They might take us in.

745
01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:46,090
They might also be
working with the regime.

746
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:48,380
It's a risk.

747
01:17:44,610 --> 01:17:47,140
What happened here?

748
01:17:47,150 --> 01:17:49,690
The same as happened in Russia.

749
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:58,780
Churches closed...

750
01:17:58,870 --> 01:18:03,490
priests shot or taken to camps...

751
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:05,120
religion banned.

752
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:13,120
They came to my church, in Latvia.

753
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:15,430
Destroyed everything, much like this.

754
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:24,050
I went back later that night,

755
01:18:24,150 --> 01:18:26,810
and there was a lone... lone guard.

756
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:30,640
Just a boy.

757
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:32,520
And I strangled him

758
01:18:32,610 --> 01:18:35,570
until his eyes
popped right out of his head.

759
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:49,210
Valka knew somehow.

760
01:18:49,210 --> 01:18:51,750
He knew I'd killed in cold blood.

761
01:19:01,810 --> 01:19:03,170
How far is China?

762
01:19:03,270 --> 01:19:04,880
I don't know.

763
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:09,220
Maybe five, six hundred
kilometers due south.

764
01:19:09,230 --> 01:19:12,350
600 kilometers?

765
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:13,680
Is China free?

766
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:14,940
They're fighting the Japs.

767
01:19:15,030 --> 01:19:16,150
I know that much.

768
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:18,110
After China is Tibet.

769
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:21,030
We could go to Lassa, the capital.

770
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:38,380
What? What are you talking about?

771
01:19:38,470 --> 01:19:40,260
They say we could go beyond Tibet,

772
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:41,880
over the mountains to India.

773
01:19:41,970 --> 01:19:42,930
What mountains?

774
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:44,430
The Himalayas.

775
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:45,970
Join the British Army.

776
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:47,800
Fight Nazis, then fight the Russians.

777
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:50,760
Go over the Himalayas?

778
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:54,480
How? On a magic carpet?

779
01:19:54,570 --> 01:19:56,780
How?

780
01:19:56,780 --> 01:19:58,490
We walk.

781
01:20:13,670 --> 01:20:14,660
Careful.

782
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,930
Come on, wake up.

783
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:33,980
I was in the middle
of this beautiful dream.

784
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:36,480
I was about to eat some salt.

785
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:38,610
I almost taste it.

786
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:41,530
I just want to go back to that dream.

787
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:43,360
It's a very simple recipe.

788
01:20:43,450 --> 01:20:46,290
You just need two sprigs of rosemary

789
01:20:46,370 --> 01:20:47,990
and a pinch of nutmeg.

790
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:50,490
Nutmeg? What about the salt?

791
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:52,540
No, we'll... we'll get to that.
Now...

792
01:20:52,630 --> 01:20:53,710
add the oil...

793
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:55,080
Mm-hmm.

794
01:20:55,170 --> 01:20:56,500
And you leave it to marinate

795
01:20:56,590 --> 01:20:57,960
while you prepare the chicken.

796
01:20:58,050 --> 01:20:58,790
This is where the salt comes in.

797
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,420
Good.

798
01:21:00,510 --> 01:21:02,170
You rub it into the skin of the chicken

799
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:03,720
with a little bit of the paprika.

800
01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:05,340
But double the salt.

801
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:06,840
Look,
you cannot just double the salt.

802
01:21:06,930 --> 01:21:08,390
It'll be too salty then.

803
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,180
I don't care, just double the salt.

804
01:21:10,190 --> 01:21:12,020
I'm not going to ruin it.

805
01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:13,720
Just double the salt, please.

806
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:15,180
No.

807
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:16,310
Tomasz...

808
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,440
No.

809
01:21:27,290 --> 01:21:28,740
All right, all right.
Everybody keep calm.

810
01:21:28,830 --> 01:21:30,290
Oh, my God!

811
01:21:30,370 --> 01:21:33,540
No, no, no! Don't run! Don't run.

812
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:35,790
Be calm and smile. Be friendly.

813
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,590
Hey, whoa! Whoa!

814
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:44,010
Everybody smile.

815
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:48,260
Hello. Hello.

816
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:40,500
That's south.

817
01:24:15,620 --> 01:24:17,660
Are we going to eat that?

818
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:20,660
It's either this or fish.

819
01:24:26,590 --> 01:24:28,670
It looks like a bird's nest.

820
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:31,000
It will protect you from the sun.

821
01:24:35,930 --> 01:24:38,270
Irena, try this for your feet.

822
01:25:24,730 --> 01:25:26,440
South.

823
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:28,430
Come on, we keep going.

824
01:25:45,590 --> 01:25:48,080
No, it's another mirage.

825
01:25:48,170 --> 01:25:49,380
We have no water.

826
01:25:50,930 --> 01:25:52,420
There's trees there.

827
01:25:52,510 --> 01:25:56,300
If there's trees, there...
there's water.

828
01:25:56,310 --> 01:25:57,670
No, I don't care.

829
01:25:57,770 --> 01:25:59,630
It's east. We're going south.

830
01:25:59,730 --> 01:26:02,260
But, Janusz,
we've got to give it a try.

831
01:26:02,350 --> 01:26:04,810
No, no, no. We must keep going south,

832
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:06,100
or you'll kill us all.

833
01:26:06,190 --> 01:26:07,650
Damn it!

834
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:11,520
Janusz, we're dying.

835
01:26:11,610 --> 01:26:12,940
We're already dying.

836
01:26:13,030 --> 01:26:14,440
Stop.

837
01:26:37,930 --> 01:26:39,590
It's a mirage!

838
01:26:40,810 --> 01:26:42,970
It's just a mirage.

839
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:17,170
Mirages don't have birds.

840
01:27:21,890 --> 01:27:24,260
Mirages don't have birds!

841
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,110
It's a well!

842
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,590
Don't fill yourselves. You'll get sick.

843
01:29:29,230 --> 01:29:31,010
At least we have water here.

844
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:32,890
Shh. Shh. You'll wake her.

845
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:34,850
Yeah, but no food.

846
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:36,850
Maybe nomads
will come to water their flocks.

847
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:38,650
When?

848
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:40,650
Next week, next month?

849
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:43,480
We should stay here
at least a few more days.

850
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:47,410
Look, without food,
we'll only get weaker.

851
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:50,360
And then maybe too weak to travel.

852
01:29:50,370 --> 01:29:56,740
I don't know. After these last days...

853
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:58,920
I don't know if
I can go through that again.

854
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:03,220
It was a miracle finding this.

855
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:06,170
Can we count on another?

856
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:07,380
Janusz?

857
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:15,260
Okay, give me your best.

858
01:30:21,610 --> 01:30:22,850
Ohh!

859
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:24,230
Ah, ha ha!

860
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,740
Wait, wait, wait!

861
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:28,030
Go, Tomasz!

862
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:32,410
Hat, please.

863
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:37,530
Lower.

864
01:31:46,530 --> 01:31:48,940
Run! Run!

865
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:51,320
Get back, get back! Take cover!

866
01:31:57,330 --> 01:31:58,620
Behind that dune!

867
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:08,220
Irena! Get down!

868
01:32:10,470 --> 01:32:11,880
Don't be afraid!

869
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:25,390
Irena.

870
01:32:25,490 --> 01:32:29,570
Irena.

871
01:32:29,660 --> 01:32:33,870
Sun-dried fish.

872
01:32:33,950 --> 01:32:35,240
Thank you.

873
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:39,710
Here.

874
01:32:52,890 --> 01:32:54,850
Can you find our way back to the well?

875
01:32:54,930 --> 01:32:57,770
It was way off course.

876
01:32:57,850 --> 01:33:00,590
Remember? I mean, way east.

877
01:33:00,690 --> 01:33:02,180
There's no...

878
01:33:02,270 --> 01:33:04,510
There's no features in this wasteland.

879
01:33:04,610 --> 01:33:06,900
I could never find it.

880
01:33:37,430 --> 01:33:39,470
When I helped my father in the fields

881
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:41,220
during the hot summers,

882
01:33:41,310 --> 01:33:43,470
we used to suck on
small stones like these.

883
01:33:43,570 --> 01:33:45,770
Made us feel less thirsty.

884
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:01,320
Janusz!

885
01:34:22,270 --> 01:34:23,730
Sunstroke?

886
01:34:31,150 --> 01:34:32,820
I'm becoming a nuisance.

887
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:37,980
No, no, no.

888
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:40,820
Do they hurt you?

889
01:34:40,830 --> 01:34:44,950
No, not at all.

890
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:48,380
They must be swelling
because I've walked so far.

891
01:34:50,630 --> 01:34:53,540
Don't you think, Mister?

892
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:54,620
Yes.

893
01:34:57,510 --> 01:34:59,050
You lie back down now.

894
01:34:59,140 --> 01:35:01,010
I'm going to cover your legs up for you.

895
01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:23,410
Irena, we can stop for a while.

896
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:26,870
No.

897
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:28,870
Just suck on this.

898
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:50,730
No! Please, no! No!

899
01:35:50,730 --> 01:35:54,100
Shh. Shh.

900
01:36:03,620 --> 01:36:06,660
Come on. We've got to keep going.

901
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:17,250
My name is Irena Zieilnska.

902
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:20,130
Shh.

903
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:22,130
My name is Irena Zieilnska.

904
01:36:22,220 --> 01:36:23,510
Shh, shh, shh.

905
01:36:42,410 --> 01:36:44,990
Put me on the ground, Andrejs.

906
01:36:48,460 --> 01:36:50,540
Just lay me on the ground.

907
01:37:57,530 --> 01:37:59,440
It's okay.

908
01:38:47,740 --> 01:38:51,610
Command thine angels to receive her

909
01:38:51,710 --> 01:38:54,240
and to take her to heaven...

910
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:57,120
her country.

911
01:38:57,210 --> 01:39:02,380
Amen.

912
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,270
I really like this one.

913
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:29,070
When did you do that?

914
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:31,400
Second night in the Gulag.

915
01:41:31,490 --> 01:41:37,700
Poor Kazik,
always in trouble with his feet.

916
01:41:37,790 --> 01:41:41,250
Who is this?

917
01:41:41,330 --> 01:41:43,120
You.

918
01:41:43,210 --> 01:41:45,920
Looks like my father.

919
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:47,250
Is that how I look now?

920
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:48,630
No.

921
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:51,250
Now, you look worse.

922
01:41:57,270 --> 01:41:59,550
You caught her smile.

923
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:03,230
Look.

924
01:42:03,310 --> 01:42:07,270
This is... just a sketch.

925
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:10,110
But I'll work on it.

926
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:11,730
I'll do it.

927
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:14,810
That's really fine work.

928
01:42:14,910 --> 01:42:20,620
You're a great artist, Tomasz.

929
01:42:20,620 --> 01:42:22,330
It's almost like a photography.

930
01:42:22,420 --> 01:42:25,620
It's the shadow.

931
01:42:25,710 --> 01:42:28,040
It's really nice.

932
01:43:06,090 --> 01:43:08,620
We have to get to those hills.

933
01:43:08,710 --> 01:43:12,830
Water may be trapped there.

934
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:16,510
Come on. Come on, get up. Get up.

935
01:43:21,270 --> 01:43:23,130
Mister.

936
01:43:23,230 --> 01:43:26,060
Come on.

937
01:43:26,150 --> 01:43:30,690
Go on without me.

938
01:43:30,690 --> 01:43:32,270
I'm done.

939
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:37,310
Go.

940
01:43:45,370 --> 01:43:48,660
Zoran...

941
01:43:48,750 --> 01:43:52,540
you go to the hills and look for water.

942
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:54,000
And you wait for us there.

943
01:43:54,090 --> 01:43:55,080
No.

944
01:43:55,180 --> 01:43:56,260
Yes.

945
01:43:56,340 --> 01:43:58,630
We'll catch up.

946
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:38,130
Did you find water?

947
01:44:38,220 --> 01:44:39,330
No.

948
01:45:18,260 --> 01:45:20,630
Show me.

949
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:22,930
Please show me.

950
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:30,560
Where...?

951
01:45:37,490 --> 01:45:38,900
Where are you?

952
01:45:55,880 --> 01:45:56,870
There's...

953
01:45:59,220 --> 01:46:00,330
water!

954
01:46:38,670 --> 01:46:41,160
Zoran.

955
01:46:41,260 --> 01:46:42,670
Around here.

956
01:46:57,530 --> 01:46:59,860
Look at that, uh?

957
01:46:59,940 --> 01:47:02,230
What if... if it's poisonous?
How can we eat it?

958
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:04,360
No, no, no, we cut off its head.

959
01:47:04,450 --> 01:47:06,940
Here. Give me the knife.

960
01:47:07,030 --> 01:47:09,450
Ah, look at that.

961
01:47:32,060 --> 01:47:33,270
Tastes like chicken.

962
01:47:33,350 --> 01:47:35,010
Yeah.

963
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:38,100
A big, black,
poisonous chicken with no legs.

964
01:47:38,110 --> 01:47:39,770
Well, it's not bad.

965
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:47,650
You know,
Valka talked of eating each other

966
01:47:47,740 --> 01:47:49,280
when we were in Siberia.

967
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:52,480
He did?

968
01:47:52,580 --> 01:47:53,990
Yes.

969
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:56,870
And? Would you have eaten me?

970
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:59,620
Yeah.

971
01:47:59,630 --> 01:48:02,120
Yeah, of course.

972
01:48:02,130 --> 01:48:04,290
I would never have eaten you.

973
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:05,920
Well, why not?

974
01:48:06,010 --> 01:48:07,550
Too stringy and bitter.

975
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:09,420
I'd rather eat snake.

976
01:48:37,330 --> 01:48:39,120
Here's some water.

977
01:48:47,590 --> 01:48:49,830
It can kill you, remember?

978
01:48:49,850 --> 01:48:51,180
What?

979
01:48:51,180 --> 01:48:54,010
Kindness.

980
01:48:54,100 --> 01:48:57,180
How long can you survive
on mud and snakes?

981
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:00,520
Just leave me here.

982
01:49:04,820 --> 01:49:07,150
You can't, can you?

983
01:49:14,790 --> 01:49:16,200
Look, Mister...

984
01:49:16,290 --> 01:49:18,400
What?

985
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:23,660
You know,
I may not even know your first name,

986
01:49:23,750 --> 01:49:25,750
but I, uh...

987
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:28,330
I know your son's name.

988
01:49:28,430 --> 01:49:31,210
Irena told you?

989
01:49:31,300 --> 01:49:32,880
Yes.

990
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:39,010
Can I say his name?

991
01:49:42,310 --> 01:49:43,300
David.

992
01:49:45,530 --> 01:49:50,440
Saying his name won't bring him back.

993
01:49:50,530 --> 01:49:51,900
What are you trying to do,

994
01:49:51,990 --> 01:49:53,070
give me the will to live?

995
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:54,570
Is that it?

996
01:49:54,580 --> 01:49:56,280
Stop me from giving up?

997
01:49:56,370 --> 01:49:58,110
And are you giving up?

998
01:49:58,210 --> 01:50:00,700
In the camps,
some saw death as freedom.

999
01:50:00,790 --> 01:50:04,200
Then why didn't you
just kill yourself?

1000
01:50:04,290 --> 01:50:06,710
Survival was a kind of protest.

1001
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:09,880
Being alive was my punishment.

1002
01:50:09,970 --> 01:50:12,300
Punishment for what?

1003
01:50:12,390 --> 01:50:15,050
I brought David to Russia.

1004
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:25,980
And now no one can forgive you.

1005
01:50:26,070 --> 01:50:28,400
And you can't forgive yourself.

1006
01:50:31,030 --> 01:50:35,570
Irena told me...

1007
01:50:35,660 --> 01:50:38,280
that they tortured your wife...

1008
01:50:40,540 --> 01:50:43,030
and she informed on you.

1009
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:50,250
Yes.

1010
01:50:50,340 --> 01:50:54,080
They did the same thing to my boy.

1011
01:50:54,180 --> 01:50:57,010
Then they shot him in the head.

1012
01:51:04,020 --> 01:51:05,850
My wife is alive.

1013
01:51:08,570 --> 01:51:10,180
She lived...

1014
01:51:10,280 --> 01:51:16,110
and was released. That much I know.

1015
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:18,530
But she'll never be able
to forgive herself

1016
01:51:18,620 --> 01:51:21,330
for what she's done.

1017
01:51:21,330 --> 01:51:24,620
You see, only I can do that.

1018
01:51:24,710 --> 01:51:27,700
She will be torturing herself,
just like you.

1019
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:31,830
So you see, I have to get back.

1020
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:35,260
I-have-to-get-back.

1021
01:52:02,450 --> 01:52:04,120
Janusz.

1022
01:52:12,590 --> 01:52:14,580
Pack your things, quick.

1023
01:53:49,140 --> 01:53:50,680
Janusz!

1024
01:54:36,940 --> 01:54:38,350
Do you hear that?

1025
01:54:39,570 --> 01:54:40,650
What is that?

1026
01:55:22,650 --> 01:55:23,940
Tibet.

1027
01:56:06,570 --> 01:56:07,900
Lassa.

1028
01:56:13,790 --> 01:56:15,450
And where is India?

1029
01:56:15,460 --> 01:56:18,240
Mmmm.

1030
01:56:22,170 --> 01:56:23,460
India.

1031
01:56:59,880 --> 01:57:02,210
India. Yes.

1032
01:57:02,300 --> 01:57:06,830
There is the track to Sikkim,
over the mountains.

1033
01:57:06,930 --> 01:57:09,010
Many people go there.

1034
01:57:09,090 --> 01:57:11,210
Are there villages on the way?

1035
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:13,340
Small villages, yes.

1036
01:57:13,350 --> 01:57:15,180
They give you food.

1037
01:57:15,270 --> 01:57:17,510
Fuel for fire.

1038
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:19,930
But you can't go now.

1039
01:57:20,020 --> 01:57:21,430
Why?

1040
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:25,360
If big snow comes, very difficult.

1041
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:29,400
You wait until spring.

1042
01:57:29,490 --> 01:57:31,780
This family keep you.

1043
01:57:36,910 --> 01:57:39,660
Well, we can't cross
the mountains in winter.

1044
01:57:39,750 --> 01:57:42,710
He said it was difficult
but not impossible.

1045
01:57:42,710 --> 01:57:44,420
Janusz, it's only three months.

1046
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:46,870
Look, we can't let go.

1047
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:48,620
What do you mean?

1048
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:52,340
If we stop now, then we'll give
In to exhaustion.

1049
01:57:52,430 --> 01:57:54,550
No, it's not giving in.

1050
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:57,880
We are exhausted.

1051
01:57:57,890 --> 01:58:00,730
I will sleep till
spring like a bear in a cave.

1052
01:58:00,730 --> 01:58:04,060
You can study Buddhism
and become a monk.

1053
01:58:04,070 --> 01:58:08,100
But first you must learn
how to like their tea.

1054
01:58:08,200 --> 01:58:10,530
I already like the tea.

1055
01:58:10,610 --> 01:58:11,900
Good night.

1056
01:58:15,990 --> 01:58:17,910
What about you, Mister?

1057
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,780
What are you going to do
for three or four months?

1058
01:58:23,500 --> 01:58:25,410
I'm going to Lassa.

1059
01:58:25,420 --> 01:58:27,380
Our friend has a contact.

1060
01:58:27,460 --> 01:58:29,550
He thinks he can
get me out through China.

1061
01:58:29,630 --> 01:58:34,250
There's a U.S. military mission there.

1062
01:58:34,260 --> 01:58:36,130
Looking out for number one.

1063
01:58:36,220 --> 01:58:38,090
Isn't that what you Americans say?

1064
01:58:38,100 --> 01:58:40,220
Zoran...

1065
01:58:40,310 --> 01:58:41,430
Zoran.

1066
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:42,430
What?

1067
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:43,600
We escaped.

1068
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:48,230
We made it.

1069
01:58:50,490 --> 01:58:51,730
You're right.

1070
01:58:51,820 --> 01:58:53,690
He's right.

1071
01:58:53,780 --> 01:58:57,570
Apart from a few mountains,
we are there.

1072
01:58:57,660 --> 01:58:59,570
We made it.

1073
01:58:59,660 --> 01:59:01,450
Not all of us.

1074
01:59:01,540 --> 01:59:04,700
No, not all of us.

1075
01:59:09,630 --> 01:59:11,620
What are you going to do, Mister?

1076
01:59:11,720 --> 01:59:13,330
When you go back home.

1077
01:59:13,430 --> 01:59:15,010
Home?

1078
01:59:15,100 --> 01:59:16,460
Build Metros?

1079
01:59:16,470 --> 01:59:19,460
Might drift a while.

1080
01:59:19,470 --> 01:59:23,140
I will fight.

1081
01:59:23,230 --> 01:59:28,100
First Germans, then Russians.

1082
01:59:28,190 --> 01:59:29,810
And then?

1083
01:59:29,900 --> 01:59:31,190
Re-build your church?

1084
01:59:31,280 --> 01:59:33,820
No.

1085
01:59:33,910 --> 01:59:36,070
I will die fighting.

1086
01:59:39,410 --> 01:59:42,320
I'm going to get Tomasz'
pictures to a newspaper

1087
01:59:42,410 --> 01:59:44,870
or get them published somehow.

1088
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:49,500
And then I'm going to
cook his chicken

1089
01:59:49,500 --> 01:59:53,540
but with extra salt,
just... just to annoy him.

1090
01:59:56,300 --> 01:59:59,170
And you, Janusz?

1091
01:59:59,180 --> 02:00:01,340
As long as the communists
are in Poland,

1092
02:00:01,350 --> 02:00:03,140
you cannot go back.

1093
02:00:03,230 --> 02:00:06,890
They'll shoot you, Janusz.

1094
02:00:06,980 --> 02:00:11,850
I'll just, uh... keep going, you know,
until it's over.

1095
02:00:18,780 --> 02:00:20,870
I'll just keep walking.

1096
02:00:37,050 --> 02:00:38,460
He's gone.

1097
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:46,890
Janusz!

1098
02:00:46,900 --> 02:00:48,430
Janusz!

1099
02:02:17,320 --> 02:02:19,600
Namaste.

1100
02:02:34,790 --> 02:02:37,130
Namaste.

1101
02:02:37,210 --> 02:02:38,500
Welcome to India.

1102
02:02:38,590 --> 02:02:39,830
Paper passport, please.

1103
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:42,170
Passport.

1104
02:02:42,180 --> 02:02:43,380
We... we... we don't have.

1105
02:02:43,470 --> 02:02:45,510
Never mind. Come with me.

1106
02:02:49,850 --> 02:02:51,180
Where have you come from?

1107
02:02:51,190 --> 02:02:52,350
Siberia.

1108
02:02:52,350 --> 02:02:53,590
Siberia?

1109
02:02:55,980 --> 02:02:57,640
And how did you come, sir?

1110
02:02:57,730 --> 02:02:59,190
We walked.

1111
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:00,770
Walked?
