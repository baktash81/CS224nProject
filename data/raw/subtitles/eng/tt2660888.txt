00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Patiently corrected and synched
by Fingersmaster. Enjoy!

2
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,626
My name is Captain James Tiberius Kirk,

3
00:01:25,726 --> 00:01:27,807
United Federation of Planets.

4
00:01:28,023 --> 00:01:31,325
I'm appearing before you,
as a neutral representative

5
00:01:31,462 --> 00:01:33,358
of the Fabonan Republic,

6
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,707
to bring you a message of good will

7
00:01:35,807 --> 00:01:36,815
and present to you,

8
00:01:36,915 --> 00:01:38,915
esteemed members of the Teenaxi delegation

9
00:01:39,445 --> 00:01:42,036
a gift from the Fabonan High Council,

10
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:44,336
with the highest regard.

11
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:48,767
What's wrong with it?

12
00:01:49,935 --> 00:01:51,036
Excuse me?

13
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:52,917
Why don't they want it anymore?

14
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,020
Well...

15
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,320
this was once a piece of
an ancient weapon.

16
00:01:56,446 --> 00:01:59,151
And now they offer it
as a symbol of...

17
00:01:59,601 --> 00:02:00,700
of peace.

18
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,210
In the Fabonan culture,
to surrender a weapon

19
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,337
is an offer of truce.

20
00:02:04,437 --> 00:02:05,855
How did they come by it?

21
00:02:05,955 --> 00:02:08,456
They told me, they acquired it
a long time ago.

22
00:02:08,556 --> 00:02:10,133
So they stole it, then!

23
00:02:10,995 --> 00:02:12,688
No they, um...

24
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:13,849
Well...

25
00:02:14,149 --> 00:02:16,528
You don't know the Fabonans,
like we do!

26
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:19,189
That's very true.
Your excellency, this gift

27
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:21,768
They're a crowd of
untrustworthy thieves

28
00:02:21,868 --> 00:02:24,411
who want to see us
murdered in our own beds!

29
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:28,644
This beloved artifact
is a symbol of trust and peace.

30
00:02:28,744 --> 00:02:30,814
They want to cut us into pieces,

31
00:02:30,915 --> 00:02:32,649
and roast us over a fire!

32
00:02:32,749 --> 00:02:33,859
I don't think that's true.

33
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:35,639
And eat us!

34
00:02:37,512 --> 00:02:38,612
What?!

35
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,805
Scotty, get me out of here!

36
00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:05,203
That was quick.

37
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:09,616
There's quite a bit
o' surface interference, sir.

38
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:16,871
Scotty!

39
00:03:25,196 --> 00:03:26,881
I ripped my shirt again.

40
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:28,581
How'd it go?

41
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:33,723
Captain, did you manage to broker
a treaty with the Teenaxi?

42
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,143
Let's just say I came up short.

43
00:03:36,243 --> 00:03:38,526
Would you look... log that and

44
00:03:38,626 --> 00:03:40,746
put it in the vault, Spock.
Thank you.

45
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,722
- Jim, you look like crap.
- Thank you, Bones.

46
00:03:43,822 --> 00:03:45,696
You got that little vein
popping out of your temple again.

47
00:03:45,796 --> 00:03:46,799
You OK?

48
00:03:46,899 --> 00:03:49,603
Never better!
Just a another day in the fleet.

49
00:03:57,214 --> 00:04:00,960
Captain's Log, Stardate 2263.2

50
00:04:03,054 --> 00:04:07,469
Today is our 966th day
in deep space.

51
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:10,506
A little over 3 years into
our 5 year mission.

52
00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:14,894
The more time we spend out here,

53
00:04:14,994 --> 00:04:18,602
the harder it is to tell where
one day ends

54
00:04:18,872 --> 00:04:21,117
and the next one begins.

55
00:04:24,109 --> 00:04:26,392
It can be a challenge
to feel grounded,

56
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,913
when even gravity is artifical.

57
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:32,954
But, well, we do what we can
to make it feel like home.

58
00:04:36,365 --> 00:04:39,003
The crew, as always
continues to act admirably

59
00:04:39,103 --> 00:04:42,907
despite the rigors of our extended
stay, here in outer space,

60
00:04:44,842 --> 00:04:47,462
and the personal sacrifices they have made.

61
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,423
We continue to search
for new life forms in order to

62
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:53,292
establish firm diplomatic ties.

63
00:04:53,892 --> 00:04:55,664
Our extended time
in uncharted territory

64
00:04:55,764 --> 00:04:58,156
has stretched the ships mechanical
capacities,

65
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,527
but, fortunately, our engineering
departement led by Mr. Scott,

66
00:05:01,627 --> 00:05:03,734
is more than up to the job.

67
00:05:04,982 --> 00:05:08,486
The ship, aside,
prolonged cohabitation has

68
00:05:08,586 --> 00:05:11,851
definitely had effects on
interpersonal dynamics.

69
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,137
Some experiences for the better

70
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:18,389
and some for the worse.

71
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,566
As for me, things
have started to feel

72
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,735
a little episodic.

73
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:32,891
The farther out we go,
the more I find myself wondering

74
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:35,318
what, it is, we're trying to accomplish.

75
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:38,646
If the universe is truly endless, then...

76
00:05:38,928 --> 00:05:42,402
are we not striving
for something forever out of reach?

77
00:05:43,818 --> 00:05:47,342
The Enterprise is scheduled for
a reprovisioning stop at Yorktown,

78
00:05:47,475 --> 00:05:50,361
Federation's newest and
most advanced starbase.

79
00:05:50,805 --> 00:05:54,078
Perhaps a break from routine
will offer up some respite

80
00:05:54,178 --> 00:05:57,122
from mysteries and the unknown.

81
00:06:12,693 --> 00:06:14,023
Sorry, I'm late.

82
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:17,128
Keenser's leaking some kinda
highly acidic green goo

83
00:06:17,228 --> 00:06:19,777
and Scotty's terrified
he's gonna sneeze on the warp core

84
00:06:19,877 --> 00:06:21,177
and kill us all.

85
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:23,503
What the hell are you drinking?

86
00:06:24,393 --> 00:06:27,909
I'm pretty sure it's the rest of that
Saurian brandy we picked up on Thasus.

87
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:30,694
My god man! Are you trying to go blind?

88
00:06:30,822 --> 00:06:32,218
That stuff's illegal.

89
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,171
Besides...

90
00:06:35,273 --> 00:06:37,387
I found this in Chekov's locker.

91
00:06:38,868 --> 00:06:40,730
Right? I mean I always
assumed he'd be

92
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,109
- a vodka guy.
- Vodka guy. Exactly.

93
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:45,957
I wanted to have something
appropriate for your birthday.

94
00:06:46,758 --> 00:06:47,813
It's in couple days,

95
00:06:47,914 --> 00:06:49,931
- you know I don't care about that.
- I know.

96
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:51,994
I know you don't like
celebrating it to on the day

97
00:06:52,094 --> 00:06:54,682
'cause it's also the day
your pa bit the dust.

98
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:55,818
I was being sensitive.

99
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,428
Did they teach you about
bedside manner in medical school?

100
00:07:00,064 --> 00:07:02,245
Or is it just your southern charm?

101
00:07:12,798 --> 00:07:14,407
- Oh yeah!
- Oh, that's good!

102
00:07:14,507 --> 00:07:16,008
Lordy!

103
00:07:18,714 --> 00:07:20,462
Are you gonna call your mom?

104
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:22,562
Yeah, of course I'll call her,
on the day.

105
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,190
One year older.

106
00:07:28,945 --> 00:07:31,510
Yeah, that's usually how it works.

107
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,298
A year older than he ever got to be.

108
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:40,046
He joined the Starfleet because he

109
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,968
he believed in it.

110
00:07:45,385 --> 00:07:47,020
I joined on a dare.

111
00:07:47,895 --> 00:07:50,419
You joined and see if you could
live up to him.

112
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,680
You've spent all this time,
trying to be George Kirk

113
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,887
and now you're wondering just
what it means to be Jim;

114
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:01,230
why you're out here.

115
00:08:03,577 --> 00:08:07,368
To perfect eyesight and
a full head of hair!

116
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,581
- Kirk here.
- Captain.

117
00:08:14,681 --> 00:08:18,336
- Approaching Yorktown Base.
- I'm on my way, Mr. Sulu.

118
00:08:19,545 --> 00:08:22,182
Let's keep this birthday thing
under wraps, huh?

119
00:08:22,361 --> 00:08:25,458
You know me, Mr. Sensitive.

120
00:08:28,898 --> 00:08:32,150
Wow, that is impressive!

121
00:08:32,408 --> 00:08:34,872
Aye, she's a beauty, isn't she?

122
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,290
What a damn monstrosity!

123
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,427
Couldn't we just rent some space
on a planet?

124
00:08:39,527 --> 00:08:42,515
Showing geographical favouritism
among inducted Federation worlds

125
00:08:42,615 --> 00:08:44,255
could cause diplomatic tension.

126
00:08:44,355 --> 00:08:45,847
Oh, you don't think that looks tense?

127
00:08:45,947 --> 00:08:49,570
Looks like a damn snow globe in space
just waiting to break.

128
00:08:50,415 --> 00:08:52,715
Ah, that's the spirit, Bones!

129
00:10:15,609 --> 00:10:17,052
Spock!

130
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,350
Do you have a moment?

131
00:10:20,897 --> 00:10:22,537
Of course, Nyota.

132
00:10:23,102 --> 00:10:25,356
I think you should have this back.

133
00:10:25,556 --> 00:10:27,148
After all, it belonged to your mother.

134
00:10:27,248 --> 00:10:29,343
It is not in the Vulcan custom

135
00:10:29,443 --> 00:10:33,018
to receive again, that
which was given as a gift.

136
00:10:43,285 --> 00:10:45,048
You guys break up?

137
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,946
What'd you do?

138
00:10:48,366 --> 00:10:51,173
A typically reductive inquiry doctor.

139
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:54,677
You know Spock,
if an Earth girl says,

140
00:10:54,878 --> 00:10:56,813
it's me, not you,

141
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,966
it's definitely you.

142
00:11:03,902 --> 00:11:05,332
Excuse me.

143
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:09,189
Commander Spock,
may we have a moment of your time?

144
00:11:33,138 --> 00:11:35,746
Thank you for bringing this
to my attention.

145
00:11:37,004 --> 00:11:39,098
Live long and prosper.

146
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,702
Live long and prosper.

147
00:12:46,637 --> 00:12:48,975
I have Def-alert on incoming vessel.

148
00:12:49,305 --> 00:12:51,373
Unidentified non-federation.

149
00:12:51,473 --> 00:12:52,811
Attention, unidentified vessel,

150
00:12:52,911 --> 00:12:54,687
you are not authorized for approach.

151
00:12:54,787 --> 00:12:57,128
Power down and await instructions.

152
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:02,274
Unidentified vessel, please comply.

153
00:13:15,468 --> 00:13:17,494
Just speak normally.

154
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,504
Language analysis complete

155
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:26,904
Is this working?

156
00:13:27,535 --> 00:13:30,763
We were on a science mission
inside the nebula.

157
00:13:31,132 --> 00:13:35,160
Our ship suffered a critical malfunction.

158
00:13:35,978 --> 00:13:37,871
I took an escape pod,

159
00:13:39,246 --> 00:13:42,509
before the ship crash landed
on a nearby planet.

160
00:13:43,427 --> 00:13:45,393
We need a ship,

161
00:13:46,015 --> 00:13:48,643
capable of navigating the nebula.

162
00:13:50,013 --> 00:13:54,598
You must have someone,
who can help us.

163
00:13:57,595 --> 00:14:01,311
We tracked her stranded ship
to a sector of uncharted nebula.

164
00:14:01,411 --> 00:14:04,410
Here at 210 mark 14.

165
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,319
Long range scan?

166
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:12,010
No data. The nebula is too dense.
It's uncharted space.

167
00:14:12,594 --> 00:14:15,972
Well, the Enterprise does have
the best navigational system in the fleet.

168
00:14:16,432 --> 00:14:17,455
She could handle 'er.

169
00:14:17,555 --> 00:14:20,074
The only ship here,
with more advanced technology

170
00:14:20,174 --> 00:14:22,461
is still under construction.

171
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,102
But it's not just the ship
that I'm sending.

172
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:28,874
I'll gather the crew.

173
00:14:29,016 --> 00:14:30,316
Captain.

174
00:14:30,627 --> 00:14:34,755
Starfleet Command sent me your application
for the Vice-admiral position

175
00:14:34,855 --> 00:14:36,923
here at this installation.

176
00:14:37,289 --> 00:14:38,589
Yes, ma'am.

177
00:14:41,187 --> 00:14:44,576
If I may, I would recommend
Commander Spock

178
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:47,187
to replace me as
Captain of the Enteprise.

179
00:14:47,514 --> 00:14:50,494
He is an exemplary Starfleet Officer.

180
00:14:50,595 --> 00:14:52,028
He'd make a great Captain.

181
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,605
It isn't uncommon, you know,

182
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,635
even for a captain,

183
00:14:57,735 --> 00:15:00,035
to want to leave.

184
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:04,535
There's no relative direction
in the vastness of space.

185
00:15:04,861 --> 00:15:07,212
There's only yourself,

186
00:15:07,517 --> 00:15:08,766
your ship,

187
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,196
your crew.

188
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,659
It's easier than you think
to get lost.

189
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:16,866
- It's not...
- I'll bring it up with the General Council.

190
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:18,926
We'll discuss it, when you return.

191
00:15:20,188 --> 00:15:21,488
Ma'am.

192
00:15:31,511 --> 00:15:33,832
- Mr. Spock.
- Captain.

193
00:15:35,598 --> 00:15:37,572
- I have something...
- Perhaps there...

194
00:15:38,095 --> 00:15:40,470
- No, please.
- Captain, after you.

195
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,062
I insist.

196
00:15:43,369 --> 00:15:44,965
After this mission, we should,

197
00:15:45,065 --> 00:15:46,095
we should sit down.

198
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,973
There's something
I need to talk you about.

199
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:50,252
I, as well, have something to share.

200
00:15:56,301 --> 00:15:58,426
We make a good team, right?

201
00:16:00,505 --> 00:16:02,164
I believe we do.

202
00:16:06,177 --> 00:16:07,790
I insist.

203
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:29,369
Lt. Uhura, open a ship-wide channel.

204
00:16:29,469 --> 00:16:30,793
Yes, Captain.

205
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,921
Attention, crew of the Enterprise.

206
00:16:36,314 --> 00:16:39,121
Our mission is straightforward;

207
00:16:39,276 --> 00:16:43,122
to rescue a crew stranded
on a planet in uncharted space.

208
00:16:43,222 --> 00:16:46,257
Our trajectory will take us through
an unstable nebula.

209
00:16:46,357 --> 00:16:50,357
One which will disable
all communication with Starfleet.

210
00:16:51,352 --> 00:16:53,089
We're gonna on our own.

211
00:16:53,341 --> 00:16:56,837
The Enteprise has something
no other ship in the fleet has.

212
00:16:57,327 --> 00:16:58,901
You.

213
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,596
As we've come to understand
there is no such thing as the unknown,

214
00:17:05,406 --> 00:17:07,532
only the temporarily hidden.

215
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:09,229
Kirk, out.

216
00:17:29,238 --> 00:17:32,960
Readings indicate
cloud density, diminishing, sir.

217
00:17:44,459 --> 00:17:47,526
This is Altamid.
My ship is stranded here.

218
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:04,396
Approaching Altamid.

219
00:18:04,496 --> 00:18:06,435
Class M planet.

220
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:08,666
Massive subterranean development

221
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,917
but limited to no life forms
on the surface.

222
00:18:11,017 --> 00:18:12,128
Proximity alert, sir.

223
00:18:12,228 --> 00:18:14,227
We have an unknown ship
heading right for us.

224
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:16,169
- Lt. Uhura, hail them.
- Yes, Captain.

225
00:18:22,195 --> 00:18:23,529
No response.

226
00:18:23,629 --> 00:18:25,730
I am picking up some kind of signal.

227
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,873
They're jamming us.

228
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,338
Magnify, Mr. Sulu.

229
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:40,669
What is this?

230
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:45,960
Shields up! Red alert!

231
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:53,773
Fire at will!

232
00:19:00,786 --> 00:19:02,823
Sir, our phasers are having
minimal effect

233
00:19:02,923 --> 00:19:05,218
and our torpedoes can't track
their movements.

234
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:06,700
Fire everything we've got.

235
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,420
Captain, we are not equipped
for this manner of engagement.

236
00:19:20,355 --> 00:19:22,228
Shield frequencies have
no effect, sir.

237
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,329
They took out the dish.

238
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,161
Shields are inoperable.

239
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:29,106
- Warp us out of here, Mr. Sulu.
- Yes, sir.

240
00:19:36,723 --> 00:19:40,253
- Why the hell aren't we moving?
- I can't engage the warp drive, sir.

241
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,484
Scotty, I need warp now.

242
00:19:48,216 --> 00:19:51,094
I cannae, sir. The nacelles, they...

243
00:19:58,689 --> 00:20:00,484
They've gone!

244
00:20:00,973 --> 00:20:05,057
Security, engage all
emergency procedures...

245
00:20:05,492 --> 00:20:08,725
Code: 1 alpha 4-0.
All personnel to alert stations.

246
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:34,379
I have hull breaches in levels 12 to 15,

247
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:37,783
6, 9, 31 and 21, sir.

248
00:20:37,883 --> 00:20:41,539
Captain, there's a chance I can reroute
the energy reserves from the warp core

249
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:43,066
to the impulse engines.

250
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,323
If we can get back into the nebula,
maybe we can lose them.

251
00:20:45,423 --> 00:20:47,002
Do whatever you have to, Scotty.

252
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,567
Keenser!

253
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:49,967
Let's go!

254
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:16,603
All clear, Krall.

255
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:02,403
Connect the plasma conduits
and stand by to re-rout on my mark!

256
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:21,058
I have the Abronath.
Secure the ship.

257
00:22:25,904 --> 00:22:26,979
- Captain.
- Go, Spock.

258
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:30,790
I've identified the individual who appears
to be leading the attack party.

259
00:22:30,955 --> 00:22:33,221
He infiltrated the archive vault
and removed the artifact

260
00:22:33,321 --> 00:22:34,451
from our mission on Teenax.

261
00:22:34,551 --> 00:22:36,072
Hold your distance until...

262
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:37,830
Spock!

263
00:22:38,131 --> 00:22:39,151
Spock!

264
00:22:39,938 --> 00:22:41,015
You two, with me.

265
00:22:41,116 --> 00:22:43,169
- Sulu, you have the conn.
- Yes, sir.

266
00:23:05,862 --> 00:23:07,457
My god!

267
00:23:10,942 --> 00:23:12,506
What the hell?!

268
00:23:16,639 --> 00:23:18,051
Doctor?

269
00:23:20,171 --> 00:23:22,311
Doctor, we must evacuate now!

270
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:00,413
Captain

271
00:24:00,513 --> 00:24:02,084
Kirk.

272
00:24:20,356 --> 00:24:22,622
Yes! We're at 100% impulse.

273
00:24:22,722 --> 00:24:24,041
Great work, Mr. Scott!

274
00:24:24,141 --> 00:24:25,970
Maximum impulse towards the nebula!

275
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,370
Aye!

276
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,916
Krall, the ship is going
into the nebula.

277
00:24:48,608 --> 00:24:50,902
Slit its throat.

278
00:25:56,749 --> 00:25:58,661
Kirk to bridge!

279
00:25:59,006 --> 00:26:01,273
We are losing the inertial dampeners.

280
00:26:01,373 --> 00:26:03,632
Systems are failing, ship-wide, Captain.

281
00:26:03,732 --> 00:26:05,097
Emergency bulkheads are sealing

282
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:08,766
but structural integrity
is at 18% and falling, sir.

283
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:11,824
Abandon ship, Mr. Sulu.

284
00:26:13,713 --> 00:26:15,357
Sound the alarm.

285
00:26:21,133 --> 00:26:23,085
We need to give those pods
a chance to escape.

286
00:26:23,185 --> 00:26:24,699
Can you lead the ship away?

287
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,604
Impulse engines are still trying
to draw power from the warp reserve.

288
00:26:27,704 --> 00:26:31,304
We cannot move until
the saucer is separated.

289
00:26:31,886 --> 00:26:33,462
I'll handle it.

290
00:26:33,562 --> 00:26:34,862
Aye aye, sir.

291
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:50,640
We gotta get you guys to
an escape pod. Go!

292
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,224
Ensign, Syl.

293
00:26:54,004 --> 00:26:55,720
I need your help.

294
00:26:56,135 --> 00:26:57,636
Yes, sir.

295
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,140
My god!

296
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,268
Spock, they're taking the crew.

297
00:28:08,505 --> 00:28:10,542
- Are you OK?
- The saucer should be free by now.

298
00:28:10,642 --> 00:28:13,548
I know, Mr. Sulu.
The Captain should be there.

299
00:30:05,325 --> 00:30:08,897
Impulse engines, drawing power
from auxiliary generators.

300
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,832
Captain.

301
00:30:22,501 --> 00:30:24,853
How many of the crew
are still aboard the saucer?

302
00:30:26,144 --> 00:30:27,444
None.

303
00:30:27,676 --> 00:30:29,371
If I'm reading this correctly

304
00:30:30,004 --> 00:30:31,629
the intruders are taking them.

305
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:34,402
Captain, we are caught
in the planet's "grawity".

306
00:30:34,502 --> 00:30:37,151
We cannot pull away.

307
00:30:41,474 --> 00:30:43,465
Get your Kelvin pods.

308
00:30:43,614 --> 00:30:45,130
- Yes, sir.
- Aye, Captain.

309
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,754
Come on! Let's go!

310
00:33:25,149 --> 00:33:28,179
You knew.
You knew we'd be attacked!

311
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:29,832
You don't understand.

312
00:33:30,461 --> 00:33:31,927
Captain Kirk.

313
00:33:37,926 --> 00:33:40,490
Yes, I lied.

314
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:44,490
Our ship was attacked.

315
00:33:45,761 --> 00:33:47,768
Chekov, check the comms for survivors.

316
00:33:47,868 --> 00:33:49,092
Aye, aye, aye, Captain.

317
00:33:49,192 --> 00:33:52,235
- Who is he?
- His name is Krall.

318
00:33:53,447 --> 00:33:56,851
He took my crew,
like he took yours.

319
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,527
How did he know so much
about the Enterprise?

320
00:33:59,675 --> 00:34:02,679
All I know is that if I did this,

321
00:34:04,303 --> 00:34:06,409
he would set them free.

322
00:34:06,509 --> 00:34:09,425
Chekov, are you picking
anything up, on those scanners?

323
00:34:10,526 --> 00:34:12,265
Nothing, sir.

324
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,816
- What if they...
- No, no.

325
00:34:16,593 --> 00:34:18,144
He was taking them.

326
00:34:18,244 --> 00:34:20,036
We have to find that saucer.

327
00:34:20,136 --> 00:34:22,800
Even minimal scanning systems
will have more range than a tricorder.

328
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,427
Aye, Captain. It's possible.

329
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:30,172
Captain, I was protecting my crew.

330
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:32,278
What is your name?

331
00:35:34,304 --> 00:35:36,283
How do you know our language?

332
00:35:36,449 --> 00:35:39,342
I know your kind.

333
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,597
I'm Lt. Nyota Uhura
of the USS Enteprise.

334
00:35:43,697 --> 00:35:46,180
And you have committed
an act of war against Feder...

335
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,390
Federation?!

336
00:35:49,699 --> 00:35:53,099
Federation is an act of war.

337
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:55,889
You attacked us.

338
00:35:59,745 --> 00:36:02,118
Your captain...

339
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:06,938
Why did you sacrifice yourself
for him?

340
00:36:07,038 --> 00:36:08,699
He would have done the same.

341
00:36:09,187 --> 00:36:12,550
And if he made it off that ship,
he will come for us.

342
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:19,175
I'm counting on it, Lt. Uhura.

343
00:36:47,611 --> 00:36:49,566
I can't believe it.

344
00:36:59,395 --> 00:37:00,915
My god, Spock!

345
00:37:05,095 --> 00:37:06,695
Sit down over here.

346
00:37:08,306 --> 00:37:10,074
OK, easy, easy.

347
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:16,520
I'll just, eh...

348
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,141
Try and relax.
You're gonna be OK.

349
00:37:18,241 --> 00:37:20,013
The forced optimism in
your voice suggests

350
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:22,363
you are trying to elicit
a sense of calm in order to...

351
00:37:22,463 --> 00:37:23,977
- Cut the horse shit.
- Doctor.

352
00:37:24,077 --> 00:37:26,104
I failed to see how
excrement of any kind

353
00:37:26,204 --> 00:37:28,442
bears relevance on our current situation.

354
00:37:28,843 --> 00:37:30,787
- What the hell are you doing?
- We must keep moving, doctor.

355
00:37:30,887 --> 00:37:32,745
Spock, this thing's punctured
your iliac region.

356
00:37:32,845 --> 00:37:34,000
Time is a critical factor.

357
00:37:34,101 --> 00:37:35,310
That's exactly
what I'm trying to tell you.

358
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:37,476
Look, if I can't take this out,
you're gonna die.

359
00:37:37,576 --> 00:37:40,621
OK? If I take it out and can't stop
the bleeding, you're gonna die.

360
00:37:40,721 --> 00:37:42,800
I can see no appeal in either option.

361
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,468
Believe it or not, neither can I.

362
00:37:46,344 --> 00:37:49,740
So, if I remember correctly,

363
00:37:50,378 --> 00:37:54,841
the... Vulcans have their hearts
where humans have their livers.

364
00:37:54,941 --> 00:37:56,909
That is correct, doctor.

365
00:37:57,293 --> 00:37:59,321
That explains a thing or two.

366
00:38:01,835 --> 00:38:04,856
You know, you are lucky.
An inch to the left

367
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,038
and you'd be dead already.

368
00:38:10,143 --> 00:38:11,915
I just don't get it, Spock.

369
00:38:12,604 --> 00:38:15,119
I mean, what...
what did they attack us for?

370
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,227
I mean...

371
00:38:16,496 --> 00:38:20,551
they do all this for some doodad
that the tiny critters didn't want?

372
00:38:20,651 --> 00:38:24,804
It is unwise to trivialize that which
one simply does not understand, Doctor.

373
00:38:24,905 --> 00:38:28,156
We can safely assume it is
more important than a doodad.

374
00:38:28,689 --> 00:38:31,275
I think you just managed
to insult me twice, Spock.

375
00:38:38,389 --> 00:38:39,914
OK.

376
00:38:40,089 --> 00:38:41,212
Alright, Spock,

377
00:38:41,312 --> 00:38:43,186
I just got one question.

378
00:38:43,286 --> 00:38:46,174
- What's your favorite color?
- I failed to see the relevance...

379
00:38:51,251 --> 00:38:53,955
Yeah, they say it hurts less
if it's a surprise.

380
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:57,221
If I may adopt a parlance
with which you are familiar

381
00:38:57,321 --> 00:39:01,224
I can confirm your theory
to be horse shit.

382
00:39:04,322 --> 00:39:05,911
We gotta get outta here.

383
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,297
You're kidding me, aren't you?

384
00:39:44,146 --> 00:39:45,483
Hello there.

385
00:39:45,835 --> 00:39:48,312
My name is Montgomery Scott, and...

386
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:50,206
who might you be?

387
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:55,127
Watch it sonny! I'm pretty handy
when I want to be, right.

388
00:40:40,409 --> 00:40:42,221
Don't come back.

389
00:40:42,852 --> 00:40:44,940
Well, we certainly showed them,
eh lassie?

390
00:40:45,678 --> 00:40:48,468
Hey, that's Starfleet property,
you cannae just take...

391
00:40:48,569 --> 00:40:51,133
But, I'm feeling generous today,
so have at it.

392
00:40:52,348 --> 00:40:54,256
- Where you get that?
- Is that English?

393
00:40:54,356 --> 00:40:56,401
I learn from my house.
Where you get that?

394
00:40:56,501 --> 00:40:58,967
- This is my Starfleet insignia.
- What does it mean?

395
00:40:59,067 --> 00:41:02,701
Means that I'm an officer of
Starfleet's Engineering Division.

396
00:41:04,152 --> 00:41:06,170
- Engineering?
- Aye, that's right, I fix things.

397
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:08,618
I know what is engineering.

398
00:41:10,107 --> 00:41:13,022
You're not with those bastards
that killed my ship are ya?

399
00:41:14,283 --> 00:41:15,695
I'll take that as a no.

400
00:41:17,623 --> 00:41:20,265
He is Krall. Him and his...

401
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:22,313
bees.

402
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:24,853
They search the stars for a...
death machine.

403
00:41:24,953 --> 00:41:28,301
They're the reason why you are here,
why we are all here.

404
00:41:28,759 --> 00:41:30,688
What, even those 3 scunners?

405
00:41:31,717 --> 00:41:34,521
They have fallen from the sky,
like me and you.

406
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:38,966
Come with me. Now!

407
00:41:39,194 --> 00:41:42,064
Wait, hang on a minute, lassie.
I'm having a difficult day, here.

408
00:41:42,638 --> 00:41:44,790
I've gotta find my crewmates.

409
00:41:45,692 --> 00:41:47,810
I will help you find your mates.

410
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:49,903
And then you will help me.

411
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,104
With what?

412
00:41:53,128 --> 00:41:55,119
- You want me to fix something?
- Yes.

413
00:41:55,219 --> 00:41:57,140
You help me and I help you.

414
00:41:58,198 --> 00:42:00,026
Alright, well,
things being as they are,

415
00:42:00,126 --> 00:42:01,402
I doubt I'll get better offer today.

416
00:42:01,503 --> 00:42:02,510
So lead the way.

417
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,775
Good.

418
00:42:03,875 --> 00:42:05,374
I am Jaylah.

419
00:42:05,644 --> 00:42:08,582
- And you're Montgomery Scott.
- Aye, Scotty.

420
00:42:09,547 --> 00:42:12,234
Come now, Montgomery Scotty.

421
00:42:13,963 --> 00:42:15,351
Alright, hold on.

422
00:42:31,867 --> 00:42:34,199
The Enterprise.

423
00:42:34,299 --> 00:42:39,060
She may not even have power
to the bridge, Captain.

424
00:42:41,703 --> 00:42:44,779
She still has a few tricks
up her sleeve.

425
00:42:46,367 --> 00:42:48,211
I'd bet on it.

426
00:42:50,038 --> 00:42:52,186
McCoy to Enterprise, come in.

427
00:42:52,968 --> 00:42:54,861
McCoy to Enterprise.

428
00:42:57,496 --> 00:42:58,817
Hey, take it easy there, Spock.

429
00:42:58,918 --> 00:43:00,650
That was just a temporary fix back there.

430
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,454
I understand, Doctor.

431
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:09,944
Fascinating.

432
00:43:10,044 --> 00:43:12,396
Ominous, dark, dangerous.

433
00:43:15,683 --> 00:43:17,342
We're going in.

434
00:43:38,096 --> 00:43:39,099
Intriguing.

435
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:43,159
These symbols are the same as those depicted
on the artifact taken in the attack.

436
00:43:43,259 --> 00:43:44,772
You think it came from here?

437
00:43:45,886 --> 00:43:47,846
It would seem so.

438
00:43:51,544 --> 00:43:53,166
Damm it, Spock!

439
00:44:02,692 --> 00:44:03,992
Hurry.

440
00:44:04,776 --> 00:44:07,443
- Are we there yet?
- Stop asking that.

441
00:44:07,543 --> 00:44:10,313
- Sorry.
- This is the way, come.

442
00:44:11,335 --> 00:44:14,580
And watch your step.
You do not want to set off my traps.

443
00:44:16,332 --> 00:44:18,632
Oh! That's clever.

444
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,657
What is this place?

445
00:44:21,757 --> 00:44:24,528
- This is my house.
- Your house?

446
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:26,228
Hold on a minute.

447
00:44:26,328 --> 00:44:27,443
Is this a ship?

448
00:44:27,543 --> 00:44:30,771
I'll help you find your friends
and you help me fix it.

449
00:44:31,063 --> 00:44:33,541
So I can leave this planet, forever.

450
00:44:34,363 --> 00:44:35,815
W-Wait a minute.

451
00:44:35,915 --> 00:44:37,487
Is this your ship?

452
00:44:37,587 --> 00:44:39,894
No, Montgomery Scotty.

453
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:43,654
It's yours.

454
00:44:44,178 --> 00:44:46,478
Oh my good lord!

455
00:44:53,416 --> 00:44:56,180
Captain, it looks like there is power.

456
00:44:56,411 --> 00:44:59,761
Alright, let's get to the bridge
then we'll find the crew.

457
00:45:40,505 --> 00:45:43,149
The console is intact Captain.
I will...

458
00:45:43,626 --> 00:45:45,483
try to re-route power to it.

459
00:45:45,979 --> 00:45:47,074
Work fast.

460
00:45:47,174 --> 00:45:50,248
Once we get this place lit up,
we're gonna draw a lot of attention.

461
00:45:51,669 --> 00:45:52,940
What do you think? Can you find them?

462
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,043
Aye, Captain.

463
00:45:54,143 --> 00:45:58,073
I am reconfiguring scanners
to modulate for the crew's sequence.

464
00:46:01,705 --> 00:46:04,900
You, with me...
I left something behind.

465
00:46:16,486 --> 00:46:17,749
That is one heck of a cold.

466
00:46:17,849 --> 00:46:19,713
Nice job, Keenser.

467
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:24,144
Alright, we got about 15 minutes
until the next guard rotation.

468
00:46:24,244 --> 00:46:25,600
Come on.

469
00:46:32,709 --> 00:46:34,174
Let's go, c'mon.

470
00:46:40,678 --> 00:46:41,978
Come on!

471
00:46:50,045 --> 00:46:52,016
This is the Magellan probe.

472
00:46:52,569 --> 00:46:55,641
Federation was using these to
find a way through the nebula.

473
00:46:56,127 --> 00:46:58,134
What's he using it for?

474
00:47:26,071 --> 00:47:27,371
What do you see?

475
00:47:30,255 --> 00:47:33,659
He's been piggybacking the subspace
links between the probes.

476
00:47:34,274 --> 00:47:36,592
Can we use it to send a
distress signal?

477
00:47:37,277 --> 00:47:38,824
I can try.

478
00:47:43,411 --> 00:47:44,508
It's sent.

479
00:47:44,608 --> 00:47:46,773
He has access to Yorktown database.

480
00:47:47,227 --> 00:47:48,527
What?

481
00:47:49,008 --> 00:47:52,026
He's got Startfleet datafiles.
Ship logs...

482
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:54,750
including the Enterprise.

483
00:47:55,551 --> 00:47:58,098
He's been watching us this whole time.

484
00:48:13,226 --> 00:48:14,936
Captain,

485
00:48:15,251 --> 00:48:17,723
the artifact was on the ship
the whole time?

486
00:48:18,299 --> 00:48:20,188
I couldn't afford to get
caught with it,

487
00:48:20,288 --> 00:48:22,272
so I hid it in here.

488
00:48:27,678 --> 00:48:31,265
Tell Krall, I have the Abronath.

489
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:35,203
Do you believe every
sad story you hear?

490
00:48:37,429 --> 00:48:39,089
Not every.

491
00:48:39,409 --> 00:48:43,324
Put the phaser down. Please.

492
00:48:47,095 --> 00:48:48,874
Did you get it, Chekov?

493
00:48:48,974 --> 00:48:52,253
Aye, Captain, I've traced
the location of her comm.

494
00:48:58,423 --> 00:49:00,583
What does Krall want with this thing?

495
00:49:01,492 --> 00:49:03,722
To save you.

496
00:49:03,823 --> 00:49:05,323
From yourselves.

497
00:49:05,423 --> 00:49:06,723
Captain!

498
00:49:51,133 --> 00:49:54,793
- You all right?
- Aye, Captain, but we are trapped.

499
00:50:05,067 --> 00:50:06,354
Can you get this thing started?

500
00:50:06,454 --> 00:50:09,249
Are you intimating that we should
engage the thrusters?!

501
00:50:09,349 --> 00:50:10,893
I am open to other suggestions.

502
00:50:10,993 --> 00:50:12,340
OK.

503
00:50:15,441 --> 00:50:16,993
- There's a problem, sir.
- What?

504
00:50:17,093 --> 00:50:19,959
Fuel is primed, but,
I cannot get it to combust.

505
00:50:20,898 --> 00:50:23,782
Captain, we are basically standing
on a "wery" large bomb.

506
00:50:23,882 --> 00:50:25,362
If you miss the combustion compressor...

507
00:50:25,462 --> 00:50:26,463
I am not gonna miss, come on!

508
00:50:26,563 --> 00:50:28,613
Do you even know what the
combustion compressor looks like?

509
00:50:28,713 --> 00:50:29,974
Ah, it's square, right?

510
00:50:30,074 --> 00:50:31,775
No, sir, it's round!

511
00:50:31,875 --> 00:50:33,708
That's what I said.

512
00:50:56,975 --> 00:50:58,508
Go!

513
00:51:22,286 --> 00:51:23,606
Chekov!

514
00:51:56,815 --> 00:51:59,662
Chekov, move!

515
00:52:56,759 --> 00:52:59,085
You think you know

516
00:52:59,185 --> 00:53:04,084
what sacrifice really means?

517
00:53:07,011 --> 00:53:09,525
Federation has taught you

518
00:53:09,625 --> 00:53:13,220
that conflict should not exist!

519
00:53:18,773 --> 00:53:21,436
But without struggle,

520
00:53:22,179 --> 00:53:26,649
you would never know
who you truly are.

521
00:53:26,837 --> 00:53:28,734
You have no idea who we are.

522
00:53:30,039 --> 00:53:32,264
But you'll soon find out.

523
00:53:32,364 --> 00:53:37,096
You mean the distress signal
you thought you sent?

524
00:53:39,919 --> 00:53:42,509
The coordinates were altered.

525
00:53:43,327 --> 00:53:46,141
Your rescue ships
will be stranded in the nebula

526
00:53:46,241 --> 00:53:49,684
and your base left, full open.

527
00:53:50,941 --> 00:53:52,990
You're going to attack Yorktown.

528
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:56,897
Millions of souls from every
Federation world

529
00:53:56,997 --> 00:53:59,030
holding hands.

530
00:53:59,556 --> 00:54:01,482
It's a perfect target.

531
00:54:01,582 --> 00:54:03,169
You're wrong.

532
00:54:03,269 --> 00:54:05,569
There is strength in unity.

533
00:54:10,179 --> 00:54:13,675
The strength of others, Lieutenant,

534
00:54:13,775 --> 00:54:17,137
is what has kept me alive.

535
00:54:17,237 --> 00:54:19,401
No!

536
00:54:43,327 --> 00:54:44,627
Spock.

537
00:54:45,352 --> 00:54:47,065
Spock, wake up dammit!

538
00:54:50,146 --> 00:54:52,428
I am entirely conscious, doctor.

539
00:54:53,009 --> 00:54:55,828
I am simply contemplating
the nature of mortality.

540
00:54:57,105 --> 00:54:59,178
Feeling philosophical, huh?

541
00:55:01,137 --> 00:55:03,709
Massive blood loss'll do that to ya.

542
00:55:06,229 --> 00:55:09,920
You asked me why Lt. Uhura
and I parted ways.

543
00:55:11,153 --> 00:55:13,161
I became concerned,

544
00:55:13,261 --> 00:55:15,238
in the light of Vulcan's demise,

545
00:55:15,338 --> 00:55:18,105
that I owed a debt of duty
to my species.

546
00:55:19,685 --> 00:55:22,512
You thought you should be off
making little Vulcans, huh?

547
00:55:24,251 --> 00:55:27,189
Yup, I can see how that'd upset her.

548
00:55:28,008 --> 00:55:29,808
I intended to discuss it
with her further

549
00:55:29,908 --> 00:55:33,473
but I received some news
which affected me unexpectedly.

550
00:55:35,577 --> 00:55:37,342
What news?

551
00:55:38,651 --> 00:55:41,091
Ambassador Spock has died.

552
00:55:45,201 --> 00:55:47,285
Spock, I'm so sorry.

553
00:55:50,509 --> 00:55:54,197
I can't imagine what that must feel like.

554
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:03,500
When you've lived as many lives as he

555
00:56:04,274 --> 00:56:06,627
fear of death is illogical.

556
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:11,435
Fear of death

557
00:56:12,182 --> 00:56:14,482
is what keeps us alive.

558
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,965
I want to live as he did.

559
00:56:24,058 --> 00:56:25,983
That is why I decided

560
00:56:26,894 --> 00:56:29,706
to redirect my efforts and
continue his work

561
00:56:30,941 --> 00:56:32,709
on New Vulcan.

562
00:56:35,799 --> 00:56:37,872
You're leaving Starfleet?

563
00:56:42,055 --> 00:56:44,171
What Jim have to say about that?

564
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:49,961
I could not find the time
to tell him.

565
00:56:50,061 --> 00:56:52,447
Well, I can tell you
he is not gonna like that.

566
00:56:53,712 --> 00:56:56,231
Hell, I don't know what
he'd do without ya.

567
00:56:57,042 --> 00:57:00,637
I mean, you know, me on the
other hand, I'd throw a party.

568
00:57:09,548 --> 00:57:12,130
My god, you're getting delirious!

569
00:57:18,045 --> 00:57:20,002
How far are we from
the coordinates of that call?

570
00:57:20,102 --> 00:57:21,817
Still a ways, sir.

571
00:57:22,477 --> 00:57:23,949
Captain?

572
00:57:24,395 --> 00:57:26,915
When did you begin to suspect her?

573
00:57:28,714 --> 00:57:30,475
Not soon enough.

574
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,447
How did you know?

575
00:57:34,341 --> 00:57:38,583
I guess you could say
I got a good nose for danger.

576
00:57:41,673 --> 00:57:43,446
Run!

577
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:54,062
Is that music?

578
00:57:54,162 --> 00:57:56,097
Where on earth is that coming from?

579
00:57:56,972 --> 00:57:58,524
There.

580
00:57:59,734 --> 00:58:03,520
I plugged the little box in the power cell
and the little mouth make it sing.

581
00:58:04,179 --> 00:58:05,702
That's very clever.

582
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:07,654
Music is a bit old fashion
for my taste.

583
00:58:07,754 --> 00:58:09,261
Not to mention very loud
and distracting.

584
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:11,186
But hey, well played!

585
00:58:12,269 --> 00:58:13,944
I like the beat and shouting.

586
00:58:14,044 --> 00:58:15,344
Oh, you do?

587
00:58:19,976 --> 00:58:20,977
Switch it off.

588
00:58:21,078 --> 00:58:22,680
- Ach, you're OK.
- Switch it off!

589
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:27,860
Someone set off one of my traps.

590
00:58:51,622 --> 00:58:53,115
Captain?

591
00:58:53,215 --> 00:58:55,012
- You know these men?
- Aye, lassie.

592
00:58:55,112 --> 00:58:57,703
That wee man there is Pavel Chekov

593
00:58:57,824 --> 00:59:00,362
and that handsome bastard
is James T. Kirk.

594
00:59:00,462 --> 00:59:01,896
They're my mates.

595
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:03,464
It's good to see you sir.

596
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:06,299
What is she doing? Scotty?

597
00:59:06,399 --> 00:59:08,649
Don't hurt them because...

598
00:59:12,055 --> 00:59:14,079
You're free, James T.

599
00:59:15,607 --> 00:59:17,264
Mr. Scott!

600
00:59:22,352 --> 00:59:24,111
Who's your new friend here?

601
00:59:24,653 --> 00:59:26,308
She sure knows how
to throw out the welcome mat.

602
00:59:26,409 --> 00:59:27,409
This is Jaylah.

603
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:29,550
I do not know what is a welcome mat.

604
00:59:29,813 --> 00:59:31,675
- You find anybody else?
- No, sir.

605
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,857
I'm sorry. You're the only ones.

606
00:59:33,957 --> 00:59:36,112
What the hell happened up there, Jim?
Why were we attacked?

607
00:59:36,212 --> 00:59:38,476
They were after the artifact
we brought back from Teenax.

608
00:59:38,576 --> 00:59:39,583
- Did they get it?
- No.

609
00:59:39,704 --> 00:59:40,810
- Have you got it?
- No.

610
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,852
I had to get it off the Enterprise
so I put it on a shuttle.

611
00:59:42,952 --> 00:59:45,187
- You hid it in a shuttle.
- Yes...

612
00:59:45,558 --> 00:59:47,161
... and no.

613
01:00:00,853 --> 01:00:04,238
This is the USS Franklin, sir.
Can you believe it?

614
01:00:04,338 --> 01:00:06,610
First Earth ship capable of warp 4!

615
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:09,730
Went missing in the Gagarin Radiation Belt
in the early 2160's.

616
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:13,060
I remember that from the Academy.
Captain Balthazar Edison.

617
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:16,464
In the first years of Starfleet.
How the hell did his ship end up here?

618
01:00:16,564 --> 01:00:17,918
There's a lot o' theories, sir.

619
01:00:18,018 --> 01:00:19,336
Surrended to the Romulans.

620
01:00:19,436 --> 01:00:21,422
Captured by a giant green space hand.

621
01:00:21,522 --> 01:00:23,645
This far out, it's gotta be
a wormhole displacement.

622
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:24,941
Can she fly?

623
01:00:25,041 --> 01:00:28,147
She's missing a few driver coils
and the EPS conduits are fried

624
01:00:28,247 --> 01:00:32,025
but Jaylah has done a marvelous job
of getting the ship's systems back online.

625
01:00:32,376 --> 01:00:35,189
- Thank you, Montgomery Scotty.
- Pardon me.

626
01:00:36,926 --> 01:00:39,105
Mr. Chekov, could you plug in
the coordinates,

627
01:00:39,205 --> 01:00:41,610
see if you can track the crew's location
from the ship's sensors?

628
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:42,717
Aye, Captain.

629
01:00:42,817 --> 01:00:43,922
He likes that seat.

630
01:00:44,022 --> 01:00:45,391
Mr. Scott, tour.

631
01:00:45,491 --> 01:00:47,521
Yes, the mess hall.
Jaylah, if you will...

632
01:00:47,621 --> 01:00:48,729
Yes.

633
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:12,975
No clue what happend to the crew, huh?

634
01:01:13,075 --> 01:01:15,629
Ach, no, sir. They'd be dead
a hundred years by now.

635
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,489
Is that?...

636
01:01:21,694 --> 01:01:23,683
That's a PX-70!

637
01:01:28,132 --> 01:01:31,385
My dad used to have one
when he was a kid.

638
01:01:31,589 --> 01:01:35,209
Mom said he'd put her on the back
and then drive her nuts.

639
01:01:38,383 --> 01:01:39,683
Sir.

640
01:01:43,511 --> 01:01:46,232
So you're telling me this thing's
been here this whole time and

641
01:01:46,332 --> 01:01:48,272
no one's ever noticed it?

642
01:01:58,598 --> 01:02:01,301
She's riggeded up image refractors.

643
01:02:03,324 --> 01:02:06,207
Like some sort of
holographic camouflage.

644
01:02:06,307 --> 01:02:07,700
Aye, sir.

645
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:10,830
Captain!

646
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:14,019
I've intercepted a weak
communication transmission, sir.

647
01:02:14,119 --> 01:02:15,984
It's a Starfleet frequency.

648
01:02:18,804 --> 01:02:20,416
Can you lock onto the signal?

649
01:02:20,645 --> 01:02:23,167
Yes, but how do we get to them?

650
01:02:23,959 --> 01:02:27,294
I have an idea, sir,
but I'm gonna need your permission.

651
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:28,694
Why would you need my permission?

652
01:02:28,794 --> 01:02:30,308
Because if I mess it up

653
01:02:30,408 --> 01:02:32,245
I don't want it to be just my fault.

654
01:02:35,114 --> 01:02:38,447
McCoy and Spock to Enteprise crew.
Come in, Enterprise crew.

655
01:02:39,013 --> 01:02:40,448
Anyone.

656
01:02:44,923 --> 01:02:46,668
Come on, Spock.

657
01:02:46,841 --> 01:02:49,005
Come on, you can make it.

658
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:54,698
Leaving me behind will significantly
increase your chances of survival, doctor.

659
01:02:54,798 --> 01:02:56,898
Well, that's damned chivalrous of you
but completly out of the question.

660
01:02:56,998 --> 01:03:00,582
It is imperative that you locate
any surviving crew.

661
01:03:00,682 --> 01:03:02,762
And here I was, thinking you cared.

662
01:03:10,229 --> 01:03:11,681
Of course I care about you.

663
01:03:14,438 --> 01:03:17,361
I always assumed my respect
for you is clear.

664
01:03:19,979 --> 01:03:22,075
The dialogue we have had
across the years has always...

665
01:03:22,175 --> 01:03:26,288
It's OK, Spock.
You don't have to say it.

666
01:03:29,967 --> 01:03:32,243
Well, at least I won't die alone.

667
01:03:38,718 --> 01:03:40,605
Well, that's just typical.

668
01:03:44,531 --> 01:03:46,075
Come on you bastards!

669
01:03:54,298 --> 01:03:55,982
Good to see you in one piece doctor!

670
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,382
Oh, am I?

671
01:03:57,715 --> 01:03:59,370
I feel like my innards
have been to a barn dace.

672
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:01,874
Aye, well, these old transporters
were only ever used for cargo,

673
01:04:01,974 --> 01:04:03,836
but a few modifications seemed
to do the trick.

674
01:04:03,936 --> 01:04:05,756
I thought it was best
to beam you one at a time.

675
01:04:05,856 --> 01:04:08,018
You know, in case you got spliced.

676
01:04:09,587 --> 01:04:11,523
Oh, I couldn't imagine a worse scenario.

677
01:04:11,958 --> 01:04:13,303
Good to have you back.
You all right?

678
01:04:13,403 --> 01:04:14,547
Yeah, I'm fine. He's hurt.

679
01:04:14,647 --> 01:04:16,302
I am functioning adequately, Captain.

680
01:04:16,402 --> 01:04:17,504
In a pig's eye, you are!

681
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:18,610
Captain,

682
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:22,013
we discovered that the stolen artifact
appears to have come from this planet.

683
01:04:22,255 --> 01:04:23,886
Dammit, Spock!

684
01:04:24,363 --> 01:04:25,886
Are there any medical supplies
on this thing?

685
01:04:25,986 --> 01:04:27,286
This way.

686
01:04:33,665 --> 01:04:35,448
Lie down, come on.

687
01:04:35,752 --> 01:04:37,052
There you go.

688
01:04:39,552 --> 01:04:41,874
How are we gonna get out of
this one, Spock? We got...

689
01:04:42,174 --> 01:04:43,415
no ship, no crew.

690
01:04:43,515 --> 01:04:46,083
- Not the best odds.
- We will do what we have always done, Jim.

691
01:04:46,183 --> 01:04:48,644
We will find hope in the impossible.

692
01:04:48,744 --> 01:04:50,414
Let's get you patched up first, OK?

693
01:04:50,514 --> 01:04:51,583
Captain.

694
01:04:51,683 --> 01:04:53,759
You must focus your efforts
on helping the crew.

695
01:04:53,859 --> 01:04:56,072
Well, that's why I need you
around Spock.

696
01:04:59,116 --> 01:05:01,003
These things are from the dark ages.

697
01:05:02,015 --> 01:05:03,315
Bones.

698
01:05:05,229 --> 01:05:07,811
I'm pretty sure this is protoplaser.

699
01:05:07,911 --> 01:05:10,896
It'll stop the internal hemorraging.
At least that's my hope.

700
01:05:10,996 --> 01:05:14,914
"The miserable have
no other medicine but only hope".

701
01:05:15,458 --> 01:05:17,692
At death's door and he's
quoting Shakespeare.

702
01:05:21,105 --> 01:05:24,650
Captain's Log, Stardate 2263.2

703
01:05:27,247 --> 01:05:29,133
We searched the wreckage.

704
01:05:29,233 --> 01:05:31,533
He must have hidden it elsewhere.

705
01:05:35,046 --> 01:05:39,346
All we have is his crew, Krall.

706
01:05:49,152 --> 01:05:51,207
You will tell me where it is.

707
01:05:51,307 --> 01:05:52,611
Now!

708
01:05:53,099 --> 01:05:55,230
No!

709
01:05:56,254 --> 01:05:57,754
Stop!

710
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:00,986
Let him go and I will give you
what you want.

711
01:06:01,086 --> 01:06:02,913
No, Syl, don't!

712
01:06:26,989 --> 01:06:28,408
Lieutenant,

713
01:06:28,508 --> 01:06:32,594
unity is not your strength.

714
01:06:34,999 --> 01:06:37,051
It is your weakness.

715
01:07:12,249 --> 01:07:14,720
We should wait until
we're absolutely sure.

716
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:17,526
No, we have to get the crew back, now.

717
01:07:18,014 --> 01:07:20,667
Chekov has the coordinates that
can lead us to Krall's base, so we go.

718
01:07:20,767 --> 01:07:24,051
With respect, sir, how do we know
that Krall was at the base when she called.

719
01:07:24,151 --> 01:07:25,976
And even if he was, we don't know
that the crew was with them.

720
01:07:26,076 --> 01:07:27,090
Or if they're even still alive.

721
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:29,492
Mr. Chekov, Can you reconfigure
the search parameters

722
01:07:29,592 --> 01:07:31,756
in order to compensate for this formula?

723
01:07:32,806 --> 01:07:35,801
Aye, Commander but, what is this forumla?

724
01:07:36,213 --> 01:07:38,934
It is vokaya, Mr. Chekov.
A mineral unique to Vulcan

725
01:07:39,034 --> 01:07:40,654
which emits a low-level radiation.

726
01:07:40,754 --> 01:07:43,676
I'll have to filter out
all other energy emissions.

727
01:07:43,776 --> 01:07:46,554
Spock, what the hell would a Vulcan
mineral be doing way out here?

728
01:07:46,654 --> 01:07:47,655
Where are you going with this?

729
01:07:47,755 --> 01:07:49,400
Lt. Uhura wears a vokaya amulet

730
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:52,583
which I presented to her
as a token of my affection and respect.

731
01:07:52,991 --> 01:07:55,057
You gave your girlfriend
radioactive jewelery?

732
01:07:55,157 --> 01:07:56,504
The emissions is harmless, Doctor.

733
01:07:56,604 --> 01:07:59,238
But its unique signature
makes it very easy to identify.

734
01:07:59,604 --> 01:08:02,002
You gave your girlfriend
a tracking device?

735
01:08:05,524 --> 01:08:07,474
That was not my intention.

736
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:10,753
I'm glad he doesn't respect me.

737
01:08:22,054 --> 01:08:25,851
I am detecting a "wery" trace
amount of "wokaya".

738
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:29,564
Does the location match the coordinates
you acquired from Kalar, Mr. Chekov?

739
01:08:29,964 --> 01:08:31,218
It is a match, sir.

740
01:08:31,318 --> 01:08:33,853
It's presence suggest that Lt. Uhura
and thereby the rest of the crew

741
01:08:33,953 --> 01:08:36,277
are being held at
Krall's base of operation.

742
01:08:36,377 --> 01:08:37,753
Can you beam them out?

743
01:08:37,853 --> 01:08:40,680
No, sir, there is some
geological interference

744
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:43,177
that is blocking the transporter's signal.

745
01:08:43,277 --> 01:08:46,031
Well I guess we're gonna have to go in
and break them out the old fashioned way.

746
01:08:46,131 --> 01:08:48,962
You cannot go to this place.

747
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:52,328
Everyone who goes there, he kills.

748
01:08:53,569 --> 01:08:56,167
You've been there? You've seen it?

749
01:08:56,267 --> 01:08:57,596
Why didn't you say something,
lassie?

750
01:08:57,696 --> 01:09:00,198
Because I knew you will ask me
to take you there.

751
01:09:02,181 --> 01:09:04,312
If your friends are there,
then they will die,

752
01:09:04,413 --> 01:09:05,988
just like my family.

753
01:09:06,088 --> 01:09:08,338
And I will not go back
to that death place.

754
01:09:08,438 --> 01:09:10,736
Aye, but if you've escaped,
then you can show us the way in

755
01:09:10,837 --> 01:09:12,112
- and the way out.
- No!

756
01:09:12,212 --> 01:09:15,111
This is not the deal we made,
Montgomery Scotty.

757
01:09:16,703 --> 01:09:19,394
If you choose to do this,
you're on your own.

758
01:09:19,857 --> 01:09:22,044
- Wait, wait.
- Let her go.

759
01:09:22,144 --> 01:09:24,344
She's lost people too, Captain.

760
01:09:33,041 --> 01:09:35,731
Look, that's our friends
out there lassie, right?

761
01:09:35,831 --> 01:09:37,348
We cannae just leave 'em behind.

762
01:09:37,897 --> 01:09:40,727
Now, we could really use your help.

763
01:09:40,964 --> 01:09:43,447
We just need you to be brave, is all.

764
01:09:44,902 --> 01:09:47,243
When we were in that place,

765
01:09:47,565 --> 01:09:49,994
Krall would come and take someone.

766
01:09:50,441 --> 01:09:54,204
There were screams, I can still hear them.

767
01:09:55,485 --> 01:09:57,183
And we would not see that person again.

768
01:09:57,283 --> 01:09:59,583
We did not know who would be next.

769
01:10:05,704 --> 01:10:07,596
My father planned an escape.

770
01:10:07,776 --> 01:10:09,529
But we were seen by the...

771
01:10:09,629 --> 01:10:11,862
by the one they call Manas.

772
01:10:14,714 --> 01:10:18,740
My father fought him so I could get out.

773
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,715
He was brave

774
01:10:20,815 --> 01:10:23,115
and Manas killed him.

775
01:10:24,622 --> 01:10:26,642
What you want is impossible.

776
01:10:29,575 --> 01:10:31,623
Look, maybe it's not.

777
01:10:32,269 --> 01:10:36,023
Right, my wee granny used to say:
"ye cannae break a stick in a bundle".

778
01:10:37,323 --> 01:10:39,423
You're a part of something
bigger now, lassie.

779
01:10:40,257 --> 01:10:41,463
Alright, dinnae give up on that,

780
01:10:41,563 --> 01:10:43,798
'cause we'll, sure as hell,
never give up on you.

781
01:10:43,898 --> 01:10:46,198
That is what being part of crew
is all about.

782
01:10:47,947 --> 01:10:50,128
Is that what you believe in, James T.?

783
01:10:52,853 --> 01:10:55,956
All I know is, we stand
a better chance with you.

784
01:10:57,876 --> 01:11:00,795
The digging machines uncover the tunnel
that goes into the crater.

785
01:11:00,895 --> 01:11:02,043
That's how I got out.

786
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:03,798
So that'll be our way in.

787
01:11:03,898 --> 01:11:05,964
The away team will beam
to the other side of the tunnel,

788
01:11:06,064 --> 01:11:07,824
follow it to Krall's base,
get inside the building,

789
01:11:07,924 --> 01:11:09,020
break out the crew.

790
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,560
Ah, Captain, we can not lock onto
anyone inside the crater

791
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:13,669
in order to beam them out.

792
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:15,772
Or, I could rig up pulse beacons
as pattern enhancers.

793
01:11:15,882 --> 01:11:17,559
- That'll get the signal into the crater.
- Alright.

794
01:11:17,659 --> 01:11:19,575
How many people can the Franklin
transport at a time?

795
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:21,387
Ah, with a wee bit o' modification,

796
01:11:21,487 --> 01:11:23,748
20 max, but I'm not sure
how long it would hold out.

797
01:11:23,948 --> 01:11:26,388
Bones, Mr. Chekov, Jaylah,
you're with me in the away team.

798
01:11:26,488 --> 01:11:28,320
Mr Scott, modify that transporter

799
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:30,366
then do everything you can
to get this ship operational.

800
01:11:30,466 --> 01:11:32,384
Captain, Mr. Chekov's technical acumen

801
01:11:32,484 --> 01:11:35,169
makes him more valuable
aboard the Franklin with Mr. Scott.

802
01:11:35,269 --> 01:11:37,287
Is thereby logical that
I would replace him.

803
01:11:37,387 --> 01:11:40,519
Why is that logical Spock?
You just got back on your feet.

804
01:11:40,679 --> 01:11:43,461
Lt. Uhura is in that facility, Jim.

805
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:48,427
I'll keep an eye on him.

806
01:11:48,527 --> 01:11:49,784
Understood.

807
01:11:49,884 --> 01:11:53,212
His soldiers are everywhere.
We won't pass unseen.

808
01:11:53,312 --> 01:11:55,890
What we require is a diversion.

809
01:12:01,591 --> 01:12:03,889
I think I have an idea.

810
01:12:28,285 --> 01:12:31,247
This is Abronath.

811
01:12:31,942 --> 01:12:35,559
It was used by the ancient ones
as a weapon.

812
01:12:35,659 --> 01:12:38,772
But, when they could not control
its deadly power

813
01:12:38,872 --> 01:12:41,716
they split it into two

814
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:44,782
and ejected the halves into space,

815
01:12:44,882 --> 01:12:47,284
hoping it would be lost forever.

816
01:12:50,835 --> 01:12:53,132
But I am grateful.

817
01:12:53,467 --> 01:12:57,489
I have spent lifetimes searching for it,

818
01:12:57,589 --> 01:13:02,470
only to have you find it for me.

819
01:13:06,253 --> 01:13:09,032
The poetry of fate.

820
01:13:11,552 --> 01:13:14,088
The world that I was born into

821
01:13:14,188 --> 01:13:17,096
is very different from yours, Lieutenant.

822
01:13:17,196 --> 01:13:19,864
We knew pain, we knew terror.

823
01:13:19,964 --> 01:13:23,327
Struggle made us strong,

824
01:13:23,427 --> 01:13:25,907
not peace, not unity.

825
01:13:26,007 --> 01:13:30,744
These are myths the Federation
would have you believe.

826
01:13:34,668 --> 01:13:36,394
Those are strong words.

827
01:13:36,494 --> 01:13:37,871
You might even believe them.

828
01:13:37,971 --> 01:13:40,279
But there's something else
going on with you.

829
01:13:40,409 --> 01:13:42,127
Something underneath.

830
01:13:45,725 --> 01:13:47,451
Wait.

831
01:13:47,551 --> 01:13:49,231
What are you doing with her?

832
01:13:50,155 --> 01:13:53,005
You already got what you wanted,
let her go!

833
01:13:53,197 --> 01:13:54,802
No!

834
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:31,282
Manas,

835
01:14:31,382 --> 01:14:33,682
it's time.

836
01:14:34,945 --> 01:14:38,486
The Federation has pushed
the frontier for centuries,

837
01:14:38,586 --> 01:14:40,262
but no longer.

838
01:14:40,535 --> 01:14:43,065
This is where it begins, Lieutenant.

839
01:14:45,992 --> 01:14:49,942
This is where the frontier,
pushes back.

840
01:15:02,788 --> 01:15:04,369
This way.

841
01:15:20,971 --> 01:15:22,863
Where is he?

842
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:45,639
I gotta admit,
it's a hell of a distraction.

843
01:15:46,361 --> 01:15:48,331
Your friends are over there.

844
01:15:51,025 --> 01:15:52,512
Come on.

845
01:15:54,171 --> 01:15:55,576
Let me deal with them.

846
01:15:55,995 --> 01:15:57,797
You've brought us this far.

847
01:15:57,989 --> 01:16:00,375
Finish the mission, Krall.

848
01:16:07,032 --> 01:16:08,332
Go!

849
01:16:41,361 --> 01:16:44,156
Commander, Uhura they took her.

850
01:16:46,622 --> 01:16:48,919
Get the remainder of the crew
to safety.

851
01:16:49,437 --> 01:16:51,183
Come on, let's go. Move!

852
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:01,263
- I've got them, Mr. Scott.
- OK, Mr. Chekov, increase the signal.

853
01:17:01,363 --> 01:17:02,817
We're gonna grab them 20 at a time.

854
01:17:02,917 --> 01:17:04,791
- Aye.
- Let's hope this doesn't get messy.

855
01:17:04,891 --> 01:17:06,514
Energize!

856
01:17:41,534 --> 01:17:42,916
Spock!

857
01:17:43,046 --> 01:17:45,440
What are you doing here?

858
01:17:46,057 --> 01:17:49,508
Clearly, I am here to rescue you.

859
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:51,317
Let's go.

860
01:17:58,898 --> 01:18:00,528
Good to see you, wee man.

861
01:18:26,970 --> 01:18:30,997
You'll die here as your father.

862
01:19:21,944 --> 01:19:24,091
Ten seconds until transporter's
recharged, doctor.

863
01:19:24,191 --> 01:19:25,299
Wait for my signal.

864
01:19:25,399 --> 01:19:26,519
- Doctor!
- Dammit man.

865
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:27,939
we're not leaving without 'em!

866
01:19:30,866 --> 01:19:32,816
Come on, let's go! Move, move!

867
01:19:59,882 --> 01:20:02,398
We are ready for an extract,
just turn on your beacon.

868
01:20:02,498 --> 01:20:05,472
- Scotty, do you have everybody?
- Aye, sir. Everyone except you and Jeylah.

869
01:20:05,572 --> 01:20:07,733
Start the beacon and we'll grab ya.

870
01:20:16,177 --> 01:20:20,211
They will leave you here.

871
01:20:22,717 --> 01:20:24,326
Captain, your beacon!

872
01:20:55,017 --> 01:20:56,664
- There it is!
- Energize!

873
01:20:59,746 --> 01:21:02,034
Jaylah!

874
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:18,347
OK, let's never do that again.

875
01:21:18,634 --> 01:21:20,191
I agree, James T.

876
01:21:23,629 --> 01:21:24,637
You all right?

877
01:21:24,737 --> 01:21:26,794
Captain, this thing he has...

878
01:21:26,894 --> 01:21:27,905
Yorktown.

879
01:21:28,006 --> 01:21:30,538
He's gonna destroy Yorktown.

880
01:21:32,052 --> 01:21:33,949
You take my house

881
01:21:34,911 --> 01:21:37,121
and you make it fly.

882
01:21:39,806 --> 01:21:41,332
Scotty, can you get this thing started?

883
01:21:41,432 --> 01:21:43,656
Start it, yes.
Flying sir, that's a different thing.

884
01:21:43,756 --> 01:21:45,395
These old vessels,
they were built in space.

885
01:21:45,495 --> 01:21:47,604
They were never supposed
to take off from atmosphere.

886
01:21:47,704 --> 01:21:49,061
Make it happen.

887
01:21:49,161 --> 01:21:51,269
They're called Starships,
for a reason, Captain.

888
01:21:51,369 --> 01:21:52,416
You tell me this now?

889
01:21:52,516 --> 01:21:55,819
Because I didn't wanna disappoint ya.
You know, in case ya didn't make it back.

890
01:21:56,019 --> 01:21:57,133
How thoughtful, Mr. Scott.

891
01:21:57,233 --> 01:21:58,854
Captain.

892
01:22:05,372 --> 01:22:06,866
He's launching.

893
01:22:13,401 --> 01:22:16,185
The attack on Yorktown
may be just the beginning.

894
01:22:16,420 --> 01:22:17,724
Armed with this bioweapon,

895
01:22:17,824 --> 01:22:19,103
he could rid it of all life

896
01:22:19,203 --> 01:22:20,707
and use the base's advanced technology

897
01:22:20,807 --> 01:22:23,497
to attack an untold number
of Federation planets.

898
01:22:25,446 --> 01:22:27,319
We're just gonna have
to get this thing flying.

899
01:22:27,419 --> 01:22:30,101
Ach, we cannae just jump-start it, sir!

900
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:36,961
OK, all systems online.

901
01:22:37,061 --> 01:22:40,610
Dilithium chambers
at 70% and climbing.

902
01:22:40,710 --> 01:22:43,946
Primary subwarp engines standing by.

903
01:22:45,622 --> 01:22:46,888
Mr. Sulu.

904
01:22:46,988 --> 01:22:48,147
You can...

905
01:22:48,247 --> 01:22:49,251
you know...

906
01:22:49,351 --> 01:22:51,771
fly this thing, right?

907
01:22:52,174 --> 01:22:53,590
You kidding me, sir?

908
01:22:53,768 --> 01:22:55,610
Fantastic.

909
01:22:55,710 --> 01:22:57,654
Scotty, how are we looking?

910
01:22:57,911 --> 01:22:59,603
Ready as she will never be, sir.

911
01:22:59,703 --> 01:23:00,840
That's what I like to hear.
Alright.

912
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:02,998
Bones, where are we with the crew?

913
01:23:03,098 --> 01:23:06,287
I could use a functioning med-bay
but otherwise we're secure down here.

914
01:23:06,387 --> 01:23:07,839
Mr. Sulu,

915
01:23:07,939 --> 01:23:09,887
we have to achieve terminal "welocity"

916
01:23:09,987 --> 01:23:12,420
in order for the stabilizers
to "prowide" lift.

917
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:15,567
Are you sure this drop
is high enough to do that?

918
01:23:16,676 --> 01:23:18,596
We'll find out.

919
01:23:26,916 --> 01:23:28,801
Call it, Mr. Sulu.

920
01:23:28,901 --> 01:23:30,375
Aye aye, Captain.

921
01:23:30,707 --> 01:23:32,727
Mr. Chekov, be ready to hit
the forward stabilizers

922
01:23:32,827 --> 01:23:34,496
full, on my mark. One quarter impulse.

923
01:23:34,596 --> 01:23:35,896
Right.

924
01:23:57,238 --> 01:24:00,166
- One half impulse, Mr. Chekov.
- Aye.

925
01:24:02,122 --> 01:24:03,942
We should belt up. Go on, go, go, go!

926
01:24:13,415 --> 01:24:15,747
Easy, Mr. Sulu,
let's not break her, now.

927
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,883
Anytime, Mr. Sulu!

928
01:24:57,995 --> 01:25:00,128
Now, Mr. Chekov!

929
01:26:12,222 --> 01:26:14,442
I have Def-alert on incoming vessel.

930
01:26:15,209 --> 01:26:17,852
No reply to all frequency ID requests.

931
01:26:17,952 --> 01:26:19,526
Visual.

932
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:34,696
Red alert! Red alert!

933
01:26:44,898 --> 01:26:47,738
Look how far they've come.

934
01:27:01,089 --> 01:27:04,874
I'm picking up distress signals from
every frequency coming from Yorktown.

935
01:27:06,409 --> 01:27:08,189
Krall's already starting his attack.

936
01:27:08,364 --> 01:27:10,583
Mr. Scott, what kind of
weapons do we have?

937
01:27:10,715 --> 01:27:14,334
We have pulse-phase cannons
and spatial torpedoes.

938
01:27:14,434 --> 01:27:15,625
Great, lock and load.

939
01:27:15,725 --> 01:27:18,223
It does not matter.
You cannot defeat the bees.

940
01:27:18,323 --> 01:27:20,508
Maybe we lure them away.

941
01:27:20,608 --> 01:27:23,239
How do we get Yorktown
time to get people to safety?

942
01:27:23,339 --> 01:27:24,994
We are coarse and buggy,
compared to those things.

943
01:27:25,094 --> 01:27:26,339
We're barely holding together,

944
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:27,842
- as it is, Captain.
- Captain.

945
01:27:28,042 --> 01:27:30,898
The flight patterns of bees are
determined by individual decisions.

946
01:27:30,998 --> 01:27:32,974
Krall's swarm formations
are too complex

947
01:27:33,074 --> 01:27:36,116
not to rely on some form of
unified cyberpathic coordination.

948
01:27:36,216 --> 01:27:37,703
- I surmise that if we...
- Spock.

949
01:27:37,803 --> 01:27:38,859
Skip to the end.

950
01:27:38,959 --> 01:27:41,032
What he's saying is,
that if we disorient the swarm,

951
01:27:41,133 --> 01:27:42,412
we can kick its ass!

952
01:27:43,027 --> 01:27:44,239
Precisely.

953
01:27:45,314 --> 01:27:47,294
Scotty, can you beam me onto
one of those swarm ships?

954
01:27:47,394 --> 01:27:48,711
Have you gone completly mad?

955
01:27:48,811 --> 01:27:50,135
- Yes or no?
- No!

956
01:27:50,235 --> 01:27:51,235
Yes...

957
01:27:51,335 --> 01:27:52,340
Maybe.

958
01:27:52,447 --> 01:27:56,010
Captain, my familiarity of the interior
of those ships, however brief,

959
01:27:56,110 --> 01:27:58,107
makes me more qualified
for this away mission.

960
01:27:58,207 --> 01:28:00,188
Spock, you're still hurt.

961
01:28:00,288 --> 01:28:02,230
She's right, Spock.

962
01:28:03,277 --> 01:28:05,584
I acknowledge and respect your concerns.

963
01:28:06,264 --> 01:28:08,706
Perhaps you would feel more confident
if I were accompanied by someone

964
01:28:08,806 --> 01:28:12,329
with a familiarity of both
the ship and my injury.

965
01:28:13,316 --> 01:28:15,216
He's gonna love this.

966
01:28:16,589 --> 01:28:18,286
You want me to do what?

967
01:28:19,067 --> 01:28:20,339
Come along, Doctor.

968
01:28:20,439 --> 01:28:21,599
Woah, wait a minute!

969
01:28:21,699 --> 01:28:25,110
Why, you green-blooded ingrate!
This was your idea.

970
01:28:25,441 --> 01:28:26,524
It's a good idea, Bones.

971
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:29,542
You know, next time you have a
piece of pipe stuck in your transverse,

972
01:28:29,642 --> 01:28:30,668
call a plumber!

973
01:28:30,768 --> 01:28:32,521
Just make sure you find a way
to break those things.

974
01:28:32,621 --> 01:28:34,606
If it gets hairy
I'll beam ya straight back.

975
01:28:34,706 --> 01:28:36,006
Energize.

976
01:28:36,230 --> 01:28:37,960
You're gonna do great!

977
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:40,411
Dammit, Jim, I'm a doctor, not a...

978
01:28:47,345 --> 01:28:50,452
You do realize, the last time
I fooled with one of these things

979
01:28:50,552 --> 01:28:51,852
we crashed!

980
01:28:51,952 --> 01:28:53,882
So don't blame me if we...

981
01:28:58,786 --> 01:29:00,251
...hit something.

982
01:29:00,351 --> 01:29:01,478
Spock, to Franklin.

983
01:29:01,578 --> 01:29:02,660
Spock, we read you.

984
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:04,710
Captain, from what I can
ascertain, the ships do indeed,

985
01:29:04,810 --> 01:29:07,491
share a cyberpathic link
which coordinates their actions.

986
01:29:07,591 --> 01:29:09,123
Patching it through, now.

987
01:29:09,683 --> 01:29:11,654
That's what their signal was.

988
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:15,040
They weren't jamming us,
they were talking to each other.

989
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:17,283
How do we get them to stop talking?

990
01:29:17,383 --> 01:29:18,979
What about electromagnetic focusing?

991
01:29:19,079 --> 01:29:20,889
We can use the transporters
to disturb their network.

992
01:29:20,989 --> 01:29:22,506
Focus might be too specific.

993
01:29:22,606 --> 01:29:25,267
If we could plant some sort of disruptive
communication signal inside the swarm,

994
01:29:25,367 --> 01:29:27,778
it might adversely affect
their capacity to coordinate.

995
01:29:27,878 --> 01:29:30,583
It would have to be at a frequency
they would not anticipate.

996
01:29:30,683 --> 01:29:33,226
We could cause a chain reaction
that will wipe out the whole swarm.

997
01:29:33,326 --> 01:29:35,001
Sir, a closed network like that

998
01:29:35,102 --> 01:29:37,410
might be susceptible
to very high frequency.

999
01:29:37,608 --> 01:29:39,176
VHF.

1000
01:29:39,276 --> 01:29:42,097
Radio. We can broadcast
something from the ship

1001
01:29:42,197 --> 01:29:43,198
to drown out their links.

1002
01:29:43,298 --> 01:29:44,542
Something loud and distracting.

1003
01:29:44,642 --> 01:29:46,042
Loud and distracting?

1004
01:29:47,422 --> 01:29:49,150
I've got just the thing!

1005
01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:51,129
Do not break my music.

1006
01:29:51,229 --> 01:29:53,294
Break it?! It'll get an upgrade.

1007
01:30:06,030 --> 01:30:08,225
Swarm ships are 60 seconds
from breaking through!

1008
01:30:08,325 --> 01:30:11,600
I just got to reconfigure the VHF output
into a multiphasic sweep.

1009
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:13,365
- Let me do it.
- Lassie...

1010
01:30:13,465 --> 01:30:14,965
- Let her do it.
- I've been doing this for forty...

1011
01:30:17,065 --> 01:30:18,565
Alright, you do it.

1012
01:30:20,361 --> 01:30:21,405
There, see?

1013
01:30:21,605 --> 01:30:23,098
- Simple.
- Alright.

1014
01:30:23,198 --> 01:30:24,826
Captain, we're ready to broadcast.

1015
01:30:24,926 --> 01:30:27,438
But the signal won't travel far,
we have to get closer.

1016
01:30:27,538 --> 01:30:29,738
- How close?
- Very.

1017
01:30:29,838 --> 01:30:31,789
Intercept course, Mr. Sulu.

1018
01:30:32,038 --> 01:30:34,689
- Put us right in the middle of that thing.
- Yes, sir.

1019
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:48,985
My old friend.

1020
01:30:59,786 --> 01:31:01,520
The swarm ships are doubling back.

1021
01:31:01,621 --> 01:31:03,354
They're forming an attack wave, sir.

1022
01:31:03,454 --> 01:31:04,730
I think we got their attention.

1023
01:31:04,830 --> 01:31:06,137
Hold steady, Mr. Sulu.

1024
01:31:06,237 --> 01:31:07,244
Brace yourselves, everybody.

1025
01:31:07,344 --> 01:31:08,839
Spock, stand by
to drop out of formation.

1026
01:31:08,939 --> 01:31:11,019
- Scotty, you all cued up back there?
- Aye, sir.

1027
01:31:11,119 --> 01:31:13,647
Ready to broadcast at 57.7 MHz.

1028
01:31:13,747 --> 01:31:16,309
- Made your choice, lassie?
- I have the beat and shouting.

1029
01:31:39,888 --> 01:31:41,942
Let's make some noise.

1030
01:31:50,012 --> 01:31:51,674
That's a good choice.

1031
01:32:04,606 --> 01:32:07,769
Faster, Doctor, we risk being consumed
by their trajectorial decay.

1032
01:32:07,869 --> 01:32:09,664
Damn back-seat driver!

1033
01:32:09,835 --> 01:32:12,742
- Get ready, Doctor!
- I see it, I see it!

1034
01:32:31,869 --> 01:32:34,034
Is that classical music?

1035
01:32:35,029 --> 01:32:37,272
Yes, Doctor, it would seem to be.

1036
01:32:37,412 --> 01:32:41,189
Lt. Uhura, make sure Yorktown
has the frequency to broadcast.

1037
01:32:43,592 --> 01:32:45,821
Sir, we now have the distrupion frequency.

1038
01:32:45,942 --> 01:32:47,587
Broadcast!

1039
01:33:08,248 --> 01:33:09,372
You all right, Spock?

1040
01:33:09,472 --> 01:33:10,620
We are fine, Captain.

1041
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:12,597
But there are still three ships
heading into Yorktown.

1042
01:33:12,697 --> 01:33:13,698
That's got to be Krall.

1043
01:33:13,798 --> 01:33:14,872
Keep on him, Spock.

1044
01:33:15,072 --> 01:33:17,872
Do whatever it takes to stop him
from using that weapon.

1045
01:33:37,093 --> 01:33:39,108
My house is breaking!

1046
01:33:39,208 --> 01:33:41,819
We've lost the polarization
of the hull plating.

1047
01:33:41,919 --> 01:33:44,020
I can redirect the power
from the dilithium chamber.

1048
01:33:44,121 --> 01:33:45,127
I need help.

1049
01:33:45,227 --> 01:33:47,238
I need you, Jaylah, let's go!

1050
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:13,908
Do not lose them, Doctor.

1051
01:34:14,008 --> 01:34:16,681
You're more than welcome
to switch places with me, Spock.

1052
01:34:37,584 --> 01:34:41,390
Captain, intercepting all three ships
is an impossibility.

1053
01:34:45,004 --> 01:34:47,479
Gimme a schematic of Yorktown.

1054
01:34:48,348 --> 01:34:50,326
There. Yorktown headquarters.

1055
01:34:50,426 --> 01:34:53,002
Mr. Chekov, can you do a bioscan
of central plaza?

1056
01:34:53,102 --> 01:34:54,107
Aye.

1057
01:34:54,207 --> 01:34:55,877
They're clearing "ciwilians".

1058
01:34:55,977 --> 01:34:57,776
Bones, there's a city plaza coming up.

1059
01:34:57,876 --> 01:35:00,034
You gotta make sure Krall heads for it.

1060
01:35:00,134 --> 01:35:02,246
- Why?
- Just do it!

1061
01:35:17,449 --> 01:35:18,902
Sulu, get us up there!

1062
01:35:19,002 --> 01:35:20,788
Hold onto something!

1063
01:36:14,914 --> 01:36:17,675
- Great work, Bones.
- Thanks, Jim.

1064
01:36:17,776 --> 01:36:20,410
Now I just gotta figure out
how to land.

1065
01:36:26,271 --> 01:36:29,122
Captain, I have 3 hull breaches
from the impact.

1066
01:36:29,222 --> 01:36:32,285
Deck 3, the cargo bay and
the engine room.

1067
01:36:32,849 --> 01:36:35,393
Alright, Sulu, Chekov,
check the cargo bay and deck 3.

1068
01:36:35,493 --> 01:36:39,053
We need confirmation that the weapon
has been neutralized and Krall is dead.

1069
01:36:56,980 --> 01:36:58,852
Captain.

1070
01:37:04,872 --> 01:37:07,304
It's Krall.
We've seen him do this.

1071
01:37:07,404 --> 01:37:10,950
It's a some kind of energy transference,
it physically changes him.

1072
01:37:11,050 --> 01:37:14,742
He must still be on board.
We would've seen him leave.

1073
01:37:16,274 --> 01:37:18,429
Sulu, contact Yorktown security

1074
01:37:18,529 --> 01:37:19,564
and lock down the ship.

1075
01:37:19,664 --> 01:37:20,864
Let's go.

1076
01:37:49,664 --> 01:37:51,364
It's about, damn, time!

1077
01:37:53,401 --> 01:37:55,195
Captain.

1078
01:37:55,805 --> 01:37:58,105
- It's about, damn, time!
- push the frontier...

1079
01:38:02,086 --> 01:38:05,037
- It's about, damn, time!
- push the frontier...

1080
01:38:05,686 --> 01:38:09,037
- It's about, damn, time!
- push the frontier...

1081
01:38:21,827 --> 01:38:23,268
It's him.

1082
01:38:24,257 --> 01:38:27,011
Scotty, I need you to link into
the Franklin database.

1083
01:38:27,211 --> 01:38:29,563
Find out what you can about
Balthazar Edison.

1084
01:38:29,663 --> 01:38:31,618
- What, the Captain of the Franklin?
- Yeah.

1085
01:38:31,719 --> 01:38:33,673
- Sir, he'd be long dead.
- No he's not.

1086
01:38:33,774 --> 01:38:36,315
I don't know how, but Edison is Krall.

1087
01:38:46,788 --> 01:38:47,788
What'd you find?

1088
01:38:47,889 --> 01:38:50,823
Well, his record goes back
way before the Federation even existed.

1089
01:38:50,923 --> 01:38:53,840
He was a Major in the United Earth
Military Assault Command Operation.

1090
01:38:53,940 --> 01:38:55,401
A lot of off-world combat.

1091
01:38:55,501 --> 01:38:57,897
- He was a soldier.
- Aye, sir, and pretty good one.

1092
01:38:57,997 --> 01:39:00,483
His military service came to an end
when MACO was disbanded.

1093
01:39:00,583 --> 01:39:01,584
Why? What happened?

1094
01:39:01,684 --> 01:39:04,095
The Federation, sir. Starfleet.
We're not a military agency.

1095
01:39:04,195 --> 01:39:06,117
They made him a captain
and gave him the Franklin.

1096
01:39:06,217 --> 01:39:08,277
- Scotty, bring up his logs.
- Aye, sir.

1097
01:39:09,474 --> 01:39:10,480
Captain's Log...

1098
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:12,022
Last entry.

1099
01:39:12,222 --> 01:39:13,624
Captain's Log...

1100
01:39:14,025 --> 01:39:16,529
I don't remember the Stardate.

1101
01:39:17,579 --> 01:39:20,145
All distress calls, unanswered.

1102
01:39:20,626 --> 01:39:22,113
Of the crew...

1103
01:39:23,414 --> 01:39:24,883
only 3 remain.

1104
01:39:25,183 --> 01:39:27,248
I won't allow it!

1105
01:39:29,622 --> 01:39:32,993
The indigenous race abandoned
this planet long ago.

1106
01:39:33,093 --> 01:39:36,292
They left behind sophisticated
mining equipment

1107
01:39:36,392 --> 01:39:38,671
and a drone workforce.

1108
01:39:38,771 --> 01:39:42,045
They had some sort of technology

1109
01:39:42,145 --> 01:39:43,659
that prolongs...

1110
01:39:44,383 --> 01:39:45,823
life.

1111
01:39:45,923 --> 01:39:49,003
I'll do whatever it takes
for me and my crew.

1112
01:39:49,103 --> 01:39:52,428
The Federation do not care about us.

1113
01:39:57,542 --> 01:40:00,272
You'll probably never see me again

1114
01:40:00,372 --> 01:40:02,640
but if you do

1115
01:40:03,518 --> 01:40:05,158
be ready.

1116
01:40:06,592 --> 01:40:08,631
Why has he not used his weapon yet?

1117
01:40:08,731 --> 01:40:11,192
Because he wants to find somewhere
to inflict maximum damage.

1118
01:40:11,292 --> 01:40:13,606
He needs a distribution system.

1119
01:40:14,104 --> 01:40:15,498
They have to circulate air here, right?

1120
01:40:15,598 --> 01:40:18,290
Aye, sir. There's an atmospheric
regulator in the core.

1121
01:40:18,390 --> 01:40:19,637
Lieutenant, contact Yorktown

1122
01:40:19,737 --> 01:40:21,848
make sure they shut it down
until we find Krall.

1123
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:23,735
How would he access the core?

1124
01:40:24,152 --> 01:40:27,047
Well, there's a maintenance tower
at the station's gravitational nexus.

1125
01:40:27,147 --> 01:40:28,222
That's the only way.

1126
01:40:28,322 --> 01:40:30,573
Scotty, you get over there,
make sure it gets shut down.

1127
01:40:30,673 --> 01:40:32,472
Lassie, you're with me.

1128
01:40:45,457 --> 01:40:47,676
Look, this thing is impossible
to shut down.

1129
01:40:47,776 --> 01:40:49,114
Aye, well...

1130
01:40:51,228 --> 01:40:53,007
...we'll see about that.

1131
01:41:00,154 --> 01:41:02,161
Mr. Scott, why is that thing still on?

1132
01:41:02,261 --> 01:41:03,282
We're working on it, sir.

1133
01:41:03,383 --> 01:41:05,286
But as you can imagine,
there's a lot of safety protocols

1134
01:41:05,386 --> 01:41:07,507
surrounding the thing that, you know,
keeps everybody alive.

1135
01:41:07,607 --> 01:41:08,831
Figure something out!

1136
01:41:08,931 --> 01:41:11,701
Be careful captain.
Gravity is gonna get a bit screwy

1137
01:41:11,801 --> 01:41:13,613
the closer you get to the center.

1138
01:41:13,713 --> 01:41:15,311
Right, we should scan
the operational schematics.

1139
01:41:15,412 --> 01:41:16,682
- See if there's a backdoor.
- Right.

1140
01:41:16,782 --> 01:41:18,306
Lassie, I'm gonna need your eyes.

1141
01:41:27,802 --> 01:41:29,006
Stop!

1142
01:41:35,507 --> 01:41:37,648
What happened to you, out there?

1143
01:41:38,048 --> 01:41:39,832
Edison.

1144
01:41:40,604 --> 01:41:43,062
Edison?

1145
01:41:45,290 --> 01:41:48,373
I have to say, Kirk,

1146
01:41:48,999 --> 01:41:51,748
I've missed being me.

1147
01:41:52,756 --> 01:41:55,369
We lost ourselves,

1148
01:41:55,469 --> 01:41:57,309
but gained a purpose!

1149
01:41:57,409 --> 01:42:01,686
A means to bring the galaxy
back to the struggle

1150
01:42:01,786 --> 01:42:04,611
that made humanity strong.

1151
01:42:04,735 --> 01:42:06,754
I think you underestimate humanity.

1152
01:42:06,854 --> 01:42:08,686
I fought for humanity!

1153
01:42:09,042 --> 01:42:13,870
Lost millions to the Xindi
and Romulan wars.

1154
01:42:13,970 --> 01:42:15,248
And for what?

1155
01:42:15,548 --> 01:42:19,099
For the Federation to sit
in the captain's chair,

1156
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:22,248
and break bread with the enemy!

1157
01:42:22,448 --> 01:42:25,175
We change. We have to.

1158
01:42:25,826 --> 01:42:28,922
Or we spend the rest of our lives
fighting the same battles.

1159
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:07,102
You lost!

1160
01:43:07,202 --> 01:43:09,806
There's no way you can make it back there.

1161
01:43:12,582 --> 01:43:14,470
Give up!

1162
01:43:15,055 --> 01:43:16,993
What, like you did?

1163
01:43:18,816 --> 01:43:21,157
I read your ship's log,

1164
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:23,397
Captain James T. Kirk.

1165
01:43:23,497 --> 01:43:25,635
At least, I know who I am!

1166
01:43:26,741 --> 01:43:28,433
I'm a soldier.

1167
01:43:28,813 --> 01:43:31,642
You won the war, Edison.

1168
01:43:31,758 --> 01:43:33,502
You gave us peace!

1169
01:43:34,022 --> 01:43:35,601
Peace...

1170
01:43:36,258 --> 01:43:38,932
is not what I was born into.

1171
01:43:41,991 --> 01:43:43,109
- Scotty.
- Captain.

1172
01:43:43,209 --> 01:43:46,994
He's using the gravitational slipstream
to carry him back to the center.

1173
01:44:28,989 --> 01:44:30,340
No!

1174
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:41,553
- What's that?
- Weapon's in the chamber.

1175
01:44:41,653 --> 01:44:43,408
Captain we have to stop
the processor now,

1176
01:44:43,508 --> 01:44:46,387
or everything breathing
in Yorktown is dead.

1177
01:44:55,063 --> 01:44:57,809
You can't stop it.

1178
01:44:59,402 --> 01:45:01,255
You will die.

1179
01:45:01,386 --> 01:45:03,678
Better to die saving lives

1180
01:45:04,355 --> 01:45:06,317
than to live with taking them.

1181
01:45:07,433 --> 01:45:09,312
That's what I was born into.

1182
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:12,916
- Scotty.
- Captain, I think we can redirect it.

1183
01:45:13,016 --> 01:45:14,645
There's a sealed construction hatch

1184
01:45:14,745 --> 01:45:16,308
that'll let you vent the weapon
into space.

1185
01:45:16,408 --> 01:45:18,037
Now we can override the locks
from up here,

1186
01:45:18,138 --> 01:45:19,491
but you have to activate the hatch.

1187
01:45:19,591 --> 01:45:21,767
- I just have to hit a button.
- It's not a button, sir.

1188
01:45:21,867 --> 01:45:24,073
It's a silver lever under a white panel.

1189
01:45:24,969 --> 01:45:27,003
- Got it.
- And there's 4 of them.

1190
01:45:27,815 --> 01:45:28,966
Once you've turned the hatch,

1191
01:45:29,067 --> 01:45:30,615
you have to exit the chamber immediately.

1192
01:45:30,715 --> 01:45:32,346
If the hatch is open
when the processor cycles,

1193
01:45:32,447 --> 01:45:34,930
and you're in it,
you're gonna get sucked into space.

1194
01:45:35,110 --> 01:45:36,790
What happens if the hatch isn't open?

1195
01:45:36,890 --> 01:45:38,480
You're gonna get sucked
into a big fan,

1196
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:39,609
with the weapon.

1197
01:45:39,710 --> 01:45:41,009
And we all die.

1198
01:45:42,316 --> 01:45:44,628
Dammit, Jim,
you won't make it out in time.

1199
01:45:54,476 --> 01:45:55,576
The vent.

1200
01:45:57,148 --> 01:45:59,185
Get out of there, James T.

1201
01:46:00,195 --> 01:46:02,480
Scotty, the last hatch won't open.

1202
01:46:09,123 --> 01:46:11,862
- Scotty.
- Work fast, Captain. Time's running out.

1203
01:46:11,962 --> 01:46:13,762
He's not gonna make it.

1204
01:47:27,203 --> 01:47:29,563
What would I do without you, Spock?

1205
01:48:01,515 --> 01:48:04,860
For decades, the Federation
thought that he was a hero.

1206
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:07,527
I guess time will judge us all.

1207
01:48:09,449 --> 01:48:11,135
He just got lost.

1208
01:48:11,235 --> 01:48:13,794
You saved this entire base, Kirk.

1209
01:48:14,607 --> 01:48:17,913
Millions of souls. Thank you.

1210
01:48:18,013 --> 01:48:21,153
It wasn't just me. Never is.

1211
01:48:21,355 --> 01:48:25,498
Needless to say the
position of Vice-admiral, it's yours.

1212
01:48:26,082 --> 01:48:28,299
No one deserves it more.

1213
01:48:31,350 --> 01:48:33,774
Vice-admirals don't fly, do they?

1214
01:48:34,526 --> 01:48:35,533
No.

1215
01:48:35,633 --> 01:48:36,933
They don't.

1216
01:48:39,417 --> 01:48:41,463
No offense, ma'am but...

1217
01:48:42,852 --> 01:48:44,498
where's the fun in that?

1218
01:49:46,672 --> 01:49:48,702
You didn't even try to get
our time out here reduced?

1219
01:49:48,802 --> 01:49:49,891
Why would I get it reduced?

1220
01:49:49,991 --> 01:49:52,839
Bones, we know our way
through the nebula now.

1221
01:49:53,039 --> 01:49:54,365
Can you imagine, what we'll find?

1222
01:49:54,465 --> 01:49:56,981
Alien despots,
hell-bent on killing us.

1223
01:49:57,081 --> 01:49:59,369
Deadly space-borne,
viruses and bacteria.

1224
01:49:59,469 --> 01:50:03,562
Incomprehensible cosmic anomalies
that could wipe us out in an instant.

1225
01:50:03,662 --> 01:50:06,080
It's gonna be so much fun.

1226
01:50:07,124 --> 01:50:09,733
By the way, where're we going?
I thought we're here get a drink.

1227
01:50:09,833 --> 01:50:12,296
I know you told me
to keep it under wraps, but...

1228
01:50:12,396 --> 01:50:14,820
Happy birthday!

1229
01:50:16,873 --> 01:50:18,270
Mr. Sensitive?

1230
01:50:18,803 --> 01:50:21,018
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Scotty.

1231
01:50:22,399 --> 01:50:26,445
Everybody raise a glass
to Captain James T. Kirk.

1232
01:50:26,709 --> 01:50:28,697
- Captain Kirk.
- Thanks, everybody.

1233
01:50:29,730 --> 01:50:32,322
- To the Enterprise...
- To the Enterprise.

1234
01:50:32,463 --> 01:50:35,985
...and to absent friends.

1235
01:50:36,609 --> 01:50:38,881
- Here's to that.
- Cheers.

1236
01:50:40,193 --> 01:50:42,877
Alright, let's get this party started.

1237
01:50:47,982 --> 01:50:50,302
I thought you've got to
finish your mission report.

1238
01:50:50,973 --> 01:50:52,277
I do.

1239
01:50:52,377 --> 01:50:55,684
But I thought it would be more pleasing
to engage with you socialy.

1240
01:50:57,804 --> 01:50:59,798
You old romantic!

1241
01:51:07,584 --> 01:51:12,114
Do you know that scotch was actually
"inwented" by a little lady in Russia?

1242
01:51:13,438 --> 01:51:15,238
Excuse me.

1243
01:51:16,980 --> 01:51:20,265
Did you drink all those yourself?
I'm impressed.

1244
01:51:20,590 --> 01:51:22,777
Someone said it will take
my edge off.

1245
01:51:23,380 --> 01:51:25,397
My edge is still not off.

1246
01:51:25,497 --> 01:51:27,363
Right, well, maybe this'll help.

1247
01:51:28,642 --> 01:51:30,754
Captain pulled a few strings.

1248
01:51:30,854 --> 01:51:34,430
That is acceptance into Starfleet Academy,
if you want it.

1249
01:51:34,530 --> 01:51:37,425
We have a lotta rules.
Don't listen to 'em all.

1250
01:51:37,525 --> 01:51:39,787
Will I have to wear that uniform?

1251
01:51:40,876 --> 01:51:42,865
'Fraid so.

1252
01:51:44,635 --> 01:51:45,872
Hey, Keenser.

1253
01:51:45,972 --> 01:51:48,387
Kevin, still not wearing pants,
I see.

1254
01:51:55,041 --> 01:51:57,156
I heard about Ambassador Spock.

1255
01:51:59,078 --> 01:52:00,837
Is that what you wanted to mention

1256
01:52:00,937 --> 01:52:03,237
that time in the turbolift?

1257
01:52:05,334 --> 01:52:06,820
More or less.

1258
01:52:08,980 --> 01:52:11,776
I trust your meeting with
Commodore Harris went well.

1259
01:52:15,312 --> 01:52:17,217
More or less.

1260
01:52:24,848 --> 01:52:26,868
You really wanna head back
out there, huh?

1261
01:52:53,645 --> 01:52:56,715
Space, the final frontier.

1262
01:52:58,103 --> 01:53:01,389
These are voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

1263
01:53:01,708 --> 01:53:05,898
Its continuing mission
to explore strange, new worlds

1264
01:53:06,017 --> 01:53:09,376
to seek out new life
and new "ciwilizations"

1265
01:53:09,476 --> 01:53:13,824
to boldy go
where no one has gone before.

1266
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:20,500
