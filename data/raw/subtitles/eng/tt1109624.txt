- Shut up.

349

to a bunk-up.

- Who's Tony?
- I'm warning you.

- No? Darling, really?

- He's not sleeping in anyone's room.

I have arrived in London

381
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,250
and so far it has rained, poured,
drizzled and chucked it down.

Hardly anyone says hello or wears hats.

And you can no longer simply
turn up at the station and get a home.

could ever belong

Mr Brown is something called
a risk analyst.

increases the chances of major disaster
