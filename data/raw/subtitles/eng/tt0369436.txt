1
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:52,885
Hi.

2
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:54,920
Hi.

3
00:00:55,788 --> 00:00:57,756
My name is, Kent.
What's your name?

4
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:58,891
Daphne.

5
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:00,760
Daphne. That's a really beautiful name.

6
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,895
It sounds like a
name of a flower.

7
00:01:02,895 --> 00:01:05,887
Obviously I know that it's not a flower, 
but it sounds like it could be.

8
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,758
I like flowers.

9
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:11,904
Smelling them, stuff like that.
Sending them to people, it's good.

10
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:17,867
Where are you from?

11
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:19,846
Connecticut.

12
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,711
Really? I'm a big fan of, Connecticut.

13
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:24,784
I'm a... Who isn't, right?
You're close enough to the city...

14
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:26,786
...and you can really enjoy it.

15
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:28,811
But your also far enough that 
you got a small town field.

16
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:31,858
- Did you go to school out there?
- Yeah, I did. I went to Wesslam.

17
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,150
That's perfect, that's a great school.

18
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,661
- What's did you major in..?
- Psychology.

19
00:01:35,928 --> 00:01:36,895
It's great.

20
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:39,866
Those are really beautiful
earrings, by the way.

21
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:41,834
They do a nice job 
of complementing your...

22
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:43,736
I'm gonna stop you right there.

23
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:45,938
Because on paper
you've done everything right.

24
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:48,741
You've took an interest
in my personal history.

25
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:50,709
You've complemented
my accessories.

26
00:01:50,843 --> 00:01:52,902
Blah, blah, blah.

27
00:01:53,846 --> 00:01:56,949
If we'd met in college, our relationship, 
probably would've developed between us.

28
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:59,752
Which I would have come to regret 
because I would have found out...

29
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,888
...that you're just as boring
and polite in the bedroom...

30
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:04,789
...as you have been during
this, god awful conversation.

31
00:02:04,857 --> 00:02:05,858
Okay, Daphne...

32
00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:07,860
If I wanted a nice
sexual pen pal...

33
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,884
...you'd be at the top of my list.

34
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:12,692
We'd just, l-chat all night long.
LOL. Tickles.

35
00:02:12,965 --> 00:02:15,866
But unfortunately, that's
not what I'm looking for.

36
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:17,926
I want a man whose
hand doesn't shake...

37
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:21,697
...when he puts it up my shirt.
Do you know what I'm saying?

38
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,810
Okay.
Daphne, if I could just...

39
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,978
Save it, Kent.
I'm not looking for a BFF.

40
00:02:25,978 --> 00:02:27,741
Daphne, please.

41
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:30,712
Bitch, I'm talking to you!

42
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:34,911
-What did you call me?
-I didn't stutter.

43
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,791
Oh you sure can talk the talk,
you crazy little slut.

44
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,725
But, can you
deliver the goodies?

45
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:43,752
I don't give a damn
about, Connecticut.

46
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,897
I hate those cheap buildings.

47
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:49,860
I'm from, North Dakota and this
is how we handle our business...

48
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,801
...in the vice and state, mamma.

49
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:54,941
Get your hands off me, right now.

50
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,739
Or I will take you to your knees 
in front of this entire bar.

51
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,777
Promise?

52
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,888
Hold on, angel crossing!
Angel crossing!

53
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,660
Get on there. Here we 
come. Watch out!

54
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:39,909
What a beautiful view.

55
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:43,949
So, this is where you live?

56
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,726
This is where you live 
too, honey. Come on.

57
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,867
What do you think
about, Daphne?

58
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,871
- I really liked, Daphne.
- You did?

59
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,740
- Yeah.
- Definitely naughty.

60
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,833
She's was a lot naughty,
but in the fun way.

61
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:04,811
What about, Kent,
did you like him?

62
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:05,912
- Kent was hot.
- Really?

63
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,880
I like those glasses,
that was a nice touch.

64
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,905
You want to try fill in 
the whole great planes vibe?

65
00:04:10,716 --> 00:04:12,741
Like he was an angry 
cowboy who drives a van.

66
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,787
- Hot.
- But also has ninja equipment...

67
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,889
...back in his apartment.
A lot's happening.

68
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:17,957
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

69
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,725
Like a transformer.

70
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:22,694
- I'd like to meet, Kent again.
- Yeah, come here.

71
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,658
Toothpaste and all.

72
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:26,899
- I love you, Kate.
- I love you, Brad.

73
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:29,663
You are the best girl
in the whole world.

74
00:04:58,731 --> 00:04:59,891
Let's get these off, of you.

75
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,767
That was fun.

76
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,970
- That feels good.
- It's the acupressure.

77
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,938
- Oh really?
- No, I just like to rub it.

78
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,809
You know, this stuff is connected 
to all different stuff inside your tummy.

79
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:10,943
- I know that.
- I push the wrong thing...

80
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:12,979
- You know what that's for?
- Not till later.

81
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:13,946
Okay.

82
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:16,739
So when's the big day?

83
00:05:17,783 --> 00:05:18,755
- Hmm.
- I'm sorry?

84
00:05:18,784 --> 00:05:21,821
We're getting married in the
spring in, South Carolina.

85
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,688
- Yeah, what about you guys?
- We're not getting married.

86
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,860
So, why do you take
the dance classes?

87
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,763
We do a lot of stuff together.
That's one of many thing we do together.

88
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:31,752
Yeah, it's fun.

89
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,933
Can't think of what
we don't do together.

90
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,867
Right, so why wouldn't you
wanna get married?

91
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:37,837
- Yeah.
- We are happy.

92
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,826
- We're happy.
- Yeah.

93
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,940
And I love her.
Marriage kind of brings pressure...

94
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,808
...and stress and all kinds of stuff.

95
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:44,877
We don't want our relationship
to turn into work.

96
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,879
We just wanna be together
'cause we enjoy it.

97
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,676
Not because we have to, you know?.

98
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,943
There's a reason that they
use the expression:

99
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,675
"Tying the knot"
or "Ball and chain".

100
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,721
Have you ever listened to the
words of a wedding ceremony?

101
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:58,690
Like: "l promise to obey."
Or "Till death do us part."

102
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,749
I'd rather be like stuck
on an island...

103
00:06:00,826 --> 00:06:03,729
...with some weird millionaire, 
hunting me and trying to kill me...

104
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:04,889
...and trying to escape
than be involved...

105
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:07,956
...in something with those. That's like 
a time bomb, waiting to explode.

106
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,970
So, what about children?
You do want to make them, no?

107
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,738
- No, no.
- No.

108
00:06:12,738 --> 00:06:13,864
- I don't wanna make them.
- Uh-uh.

109
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,845
I just don't want to be like,
responsible for this kid...

110
00:06:19,845 --> 00:06:21,710
...and hurt their feelings 
and disappoint them.

111
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:22,949
Yeah, that's what 
happened to our families.

112
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,951
We're both from
divorced families.

113
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,920
We've seen it play out. We don't
need to repeat the pattern.

114
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,787
But anyway, congratulations
on getting married.

115
00:06:30,856 --> 00:06:32,847
That sounds like a really cool 
thing, and to each their own.

116
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:33,914
Yeah, absolutely.

117
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:35,956
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas!

118
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:37,657
Bye-bye.

119
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:03,683
- Big-bad Brad!
- Hi!

120
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,858
- How are you guys doing?
- Look at this. How are you?

121
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,689
You remember
my girlfriend, Kate.

122
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,762
- How are you? Good to see you.
- Hi.

123
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,831
What are you guys
doing for, christmas?

124
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,698
We got the entire
family flying in.

125
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,791
13 airport pick-ups.

126
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:20,737
4 days of listening
to how gifted my nieces are.

127
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,777
My brother thinks his daughter,
the four year old...

128
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,677
...is gonna be the next, Beyonce.

129
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:32,712
She's bad and she sucks.

130
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:36,889
I'm vacationing in tropical
Albany this year...

131
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,724
...with, Tricia's family.

132
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,760
They got us a cot,
which is awesome.

133
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,818
But we'll probably end up sleeping...

134
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,963
...on the musty couch
in the basement with the cats.

135
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,731
All seven of them.

136
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,722
We'll get to be there
the whole week.

137
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:49,969
Sounds like
a prison sentence.

138
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,903
Why do you guys put
yourselves through that?

139
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,769
It's, christmas, right,
don't you have to?

140
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,975
We don't need to do it.

141
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,910
We don't.
We don't do it.

142
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,901
- We're done.
- Why, what are you doing?

143
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,641
- We're going to Fiji. Just the two of us.
- Yeah.

144
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:03,647
Fiji?

145
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:04,717
Yeah.

146
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:05,951
Don't your families
get upset?

147
00:08:05,951 --> 00:08:07,919
Not if you tell them 
you're doing charity work.

148
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,655
Like building houses
in third world countries.

149
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,749
Teaching english as a second 
language in, Puerto Rico.

150
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,726
Helping orphans in, Somalia.

151
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,763
Helping, Chinese kids capture lobsters.

152
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,735
Boil them, cut them, clean the 
weird stuff out the middle.

153
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,870
We find it that the more
details you give...

154
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,838
...kinda throws them off the set.

155
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:29,875
You lie to your families
at, christmas time?

156
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,673
You really can't spell 
families without lies.

157
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:33,812
Try it.

158
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,914
But don't you
ever feel guilty?

159
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,752
For taking a vacation
on our vacation?

160
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:40,786
No, not really.

161
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:43,653
- You do look pretty sexy with a tan.
- Thanks, babe.

162
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,749
You could take this one.
This one here.

163
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,718
- Like that.
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

164
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,934
Oh by the way I made a couple's
massage reservation for this weekend.

165
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,765
- You did? That's great.
- Yeah.

166
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,940
I should probably check 
us in online, after this.

167
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,907
I did it.

168
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,844
You checked us in already?
You're the best, sweetheart.

169
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:07,745
I picked up a pair of those noise 
canceling headphones, you wanted.

170
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:09,849
- You did not.
- For the next time.

171
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,840
- Oh my God.
- I'm excited.

172
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:15,721
We should probably sign up for 
the scuba boat as soon as we get there...

173
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,655
I heard it fills up
really quick.

174
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,792
Do you feel like we've
been on this vacation before?

175
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,728
The scuba diving, we did that
in Bali and Costa Rica.

176
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,857
Yeah, but this is Fiji.
We've never been to Fiji.

177
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,837
That's a whole different island.
and the resort there is beautiful,

178
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,704
and the scuba diving
there's gonna be totally different.

179
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,674
It's different water different fish.

180
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,811
It's gonna be really good.
I'm excited.

181
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:40,813
- lt's gonna be amazing.
- Are you excited?

182
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,838
- I am. I'm really excited.
- I am excited.

183
00:09:45,951 --> 00:09:47,851
- I love you.
- I love you too.

184
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:03,895
Hey, Mom, merry, christmas.

185
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:05,871
Yeah.

186
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:09,841
Listen. Actually I'm sorry
I didn't call you sooner.

187
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,900
We're actually heading 
out today to, Burma.

188
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:15,938
Yeah. That's exactly
the island in, Asia, Burma.

189
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:18,943
We're inoculating babies there.

190
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,844
Yeah, we'll be helping 
out with these kids.

191
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,990
It's such a great cause, but honestly...

192
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:28,727
it just sucks that we're not able to 
be there with you and the entire family.

193
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:31,855
You know how much. I know, mom it's been 
three years since I've been there for, christmas.

194
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,899
I wish I would've
called you sooner.

195
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:37,732
But, Kate sent all
the gifts and stuff to you.

196
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,733
Okay.

197
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,776
That's Merry Christmas
in Burmese.

198
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,845
All right, I'll tell her.
I love you too. Bye.

199
00:10:48,747 --> 00:10:49,873
You learned "Merry Christmas" in, Burmese.

200
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,713
I gotta take everything
to the next level.

201
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,810
Come on, let's do this.
I'm excited.

202
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,778
Attention, San Francisco
passengers.

203
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:21,881
All flights
have been grounded...

204
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,749
...due to extreme
weather conditions.

205
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:24,750
Sir, excuse me.

206
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,919
Well the phone's will be in 
and your flight's not going out.

207
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,922
But what I can do
is get you set up for standby...

208
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,686
...on the first flight
to Fiji tomorrow. Okay?

209
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:33,893
Tomorrow's not going to be great for us.

210
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,961
We've already scheduled
a couple's massage...

211
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:38,896
I'm sorry, sir. I don't make
the fog, I deal with it.

212
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:42,801
The best I can do is get you
guys set up a suite at the, Radisson.

213
00:11:42,801 --> 00:11:45,736
They have lovely accommodations, 
it's right next to the airport.

214
00:11:45,804 --> 00:11:47,840
You promise?
At the, Radisson?

215
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,708
- Did you hear that?
- Brad.

216
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,776
No, no that's terrific.

217
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,767
Would it be possible
to take us out...

218
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,745
and get us, McDonald's as desert?

219
00:11:54,813 --> 00:11:56,782
I'll start missing
flights more often.

220
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:58,851
With this kind of
red carpet service is available.

221
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,751
- Because that's terrific. A suite.
- Brad, please.

222
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:03,789
That's not helping, Brad, okay.
Is there another airline...

223
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,825
that you're possibly affiliated with?
Like a sister airline that we can transfer to?

224
00:12:06,825 --> 00:12:09,885
- No, I'm sorry.
- Do you have a cousin airline?

225
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:12,863
How about an airline that 
your airline's filled out before?

226
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:16,800
The FAA has ruled that the, Bay
area fog is simply too thick.

227
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,872
No flights are coming in
and no flights are going out...

228
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,840
until at least tomorrow morning.

229
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,910
Let's see how travelers
are coping in all of this chaos.

230
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,676
We have a couple over here.
Excuse me, sir? Excuse me.

231
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,678
Where are you headed
for this, christmas?

232
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,683
We're live on the air.

233
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,855
You certainly look
dressed for a vacation.

234
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,854
We're taking...
And we take the trips.

235
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:49,835
We'll take a different trip.

236
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,938
What he's trying to say is
that we plan a trip every year.

237
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,668
This is actually
ruining our Christmas.

238
00:12:55,874 --> 00:12:58,809
You must be pretty upset.
Are you visiting friends and family?

239
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:02,948
This is, Kate.

240
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:05,839
Hi, mom.

241
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,822
I know, mom. All the flights
were cancelled for today.

242
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:10,956
- But they're not really...
- Sweetheart It's, my dad.

243
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,726
They're not sure, 
whether or not if it'll be today.

244
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,861
You want me to answer it?
Do I answer or no?

245
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:17,658
Do I pick it up or not?

246
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,932
Yes, I know. I understand
you have feelings.

247
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:23,732
What? What do you want me to do? I don't know 
what this means, I don't know what your saying to me.

248
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,742
Alright he's gonna give you a big 
hug when he see's you, mom.

249
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,801
- I'm not hugging anybody.
- He's really excited about the hug.

250
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,804
- Alright we'll see you at noon.
- Noon?

251
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,950
Kate, are you crazy?
Did you just commit us to go?

252
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,720
What did you want me to say?
They saw us on the news.

253
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,745
We're obviously not
inoculating babies in, Burma.

254
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:44,948
- No...
- We are stuck here.

255
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:46,925
By the way, what did you say to your dad?

256
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:49,862
I told my dad that of course 
we'll be going over there.

257
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,762
Don't compare
your situation.

258
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,730
- You kidding?
- There's new stuff...

259
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:54,867
...that you're missing here, Kate.

260
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,665
My Dad's a unique specific
animal. Your mother's not.

261
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:59,972
My dad, your mom.
My mom, your dad.

262
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:00,973
Great.

263
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,669
We'll see all four families in one day, Kate.

264
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,869
Do you have any idea what this means?
Do you have any idea what you committed us to?

265
00:14:05,944 --> 00:14:08,845
I know exactly
what this means.

266
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:21,926
Brad.

267
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:25,730
Baby.

268
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,730
I don't want to fight.

269
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:30,903
Honey, I don't wanna fight either.

270
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,772
- I hate this.
- We never fight, honey. I'm sorry.

271
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:34,739
I love you.

272
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:38,811
This is what our families do, you 
know that? This is what happens.

273
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,946
My mother makes me crazy
every time I talk to her.

274
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:43,749
You're absolutely right.
Here's all we got to do.

275
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,784
We just gotta get through these, Four Christmases...

276
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,920
as quickly and as painlessly as possible.

277
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,946
Exactly. Promise me that no
matter what happens today...

278
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,950
we'll still have each other, right.

279
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,689
- Honey, of course we will.
- Okay.

280
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,764
Hey listen. If one of these
houses gets a little too intense...

281
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,843
- I think we're gonna need a exit strategy.
- Yes.

282
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,779
We'll need a word that both of us know
that means it's time to leave.

283
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,747
What do you think our 
safe word, should be?

284
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:16,982
It's a good idea.
Mistletoe.

285
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:18,950
- Mistletoe is really good.
- Okay.

286
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:23,652
By the way, my father's house
can get particularly uncomfortable.

287
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:26,892
Please sweetheat, do not feel 
embarrassed if you feel the need...

288
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,883
to pull the rip cord early,
say, Mistletoe...

289
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,952
if this house gets too 
uncomfortable for you.

290
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,722
- Okay.
- Even if we're there for 10 min.

291
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,699
All right, I'll let you 
know where I'm at.

292
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,836
I'm just looking out for you 
on this one. I want you to be cool.

293
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,772
Brad, I'm gonna go see your 
dad and your brothers right now.

294
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:42,933
Unless you're too weird
with it, then we're out.

295
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,800
- I'm going in.
- And going out would be...

296
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:49,781
- Mistletoe.
- Done. Let's get out of here.

297
00:15:49,781 --> 00:15:52,944
Brad, we're going in. Let's go.

298
00:16:02,694 --> 00:16:05,797
Son of a bitch.
The TV stars actually came.

299
00:16:05,797 --> 00:16:07,866
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Dad.

300
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,835
Merry Christmas, tiny.
Good to see you.

301
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,860
- Thanks for having us.
- Good to see you.

302
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:12,971
- Come on in.
- Okay.

303
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:15,807
Let's... Let's celebrate.

304
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:17,672
Okay. Sounds good.

305
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,849
That's a lot of presents 
you sent there, boy.

306
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,714
You're trying
to out do us?

307
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,785
The biggest one is 
for you, Howard.

308
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,689
Yeah? What is it?

309
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:31,781
I'm not gonna tell you.

310
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:36,851
What, are you crazy?

311
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:37,896
- Bro.
- Hey, buddy.

312
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:44,669
Baby!

313
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:49,941
Kate, these are my brothers:
Denver and Dallas.

314
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,745
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

315
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:55,713
You must be, Orlando's girl.

316
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:56,846
Orlando?

317
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,918
We're named after the cities
in which we were conceived.

318
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:02,887
I'm, Denver that's, Dallas.
And this is, Orlando.

319
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,692
Orlando?

320
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,786
My given name is, Orlando.
But I changed it to, Brad.

321
00:17:10,862 --> 00:17:11,886
I'm, Brad.

322
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:13,966
What?

323
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,764
Well, merry christmas one and all.

324
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,835
- Orderves for anyone.
- Come on.

325
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,673
Who are you trying
to impress, Suze?

326
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,809
We also got beer moses in the back.

327
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:24,798
Ladies first.

328
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:26,733
Thank you so much.

329
00:17:29,881 --> 00:17:31,781
What is this?
Is this cheese?

330
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,781
Yeah, spray.

331
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:38,923
Spray cheese from the famous
family of aerosol cheeses.

332
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,854
Give me a hand.

333
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:50,836
Here we go.

334
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,771
Do you have something
to say about my wife's cheese?

335
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:56,975
Hump it! Hump it!

336
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,944
I haven't seen
that move in a while.

337
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:02,710
Shut it, soldier boy!

338
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:05,678
The spray cheese!
The spray cheese!

339
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,909
Bring it home, soldier boy.

340
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,895
Oh my, god, honey. I am so sorry
that you had to see that.

341
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,906
Let me apologize for them.

342
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:31,910
If you wanna say "Mistletoe"
because it's too heavy for you, I get it.

343
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,879
I get it. I totally get it. Don't 
feel weird about that.

344
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,882
If you need to get out of here, you let me
know where your comfort zone is.

345
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:37,871
Beacause that was weird.

346
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,986
I can not believe you didn't
tell me your real name.

347
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,783
- What are you talking about?
- l just...

348
00:18:43,855 --> 00:18:45,948
It's just crazy to me. We've 
been together for 3 years now

349
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:48,827
and I don't even know your real name.
doesn't that strike you as a little bit odd?

350
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:52,660
No, it's not a little bit odd. I 
hated my name, so I changed it.

351
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:55,667
You don't say hey: "My name used
to be asshole, but it's, Bob."

352
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:58,704
- You just say: "My name is, Bob."
- Maybe to a stranger on the street...

353
00:18:58,704 --> 00:18:59,971
but to somebody you're 
sharing your life with,

354
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:01,840
Yeah you tell them your real name.

355
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,842
Sweetheart, I really don't want 
to get into this right now.

356
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,867
By rhe way this is exactly why I was
afraid if we came here.

357
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:08,880
this is isn't us, it's them.
We're letting them in.

358
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,850
Okay but your real name isn't asshole.
It's like your middle name.

359
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,819
Don't wanna be
blindsided again.

360
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,722
That's very funny. Go ahead
and take a shot at me.

361
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,790
It's bad enough, I have to deal
with those, Neanderthals

362
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,655
but now I gotta take it from you too?

363
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,962
No, you shouldn't. You shouldn't
let them walk over you either.

364
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:26,898
Kate, they are trained, UFC fighters.

365
00:19:26,898 --> 00:19:28,798
They know pressure
points on people.

366
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,702
But you're twice their size.

367
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,804
They're semi-professional
cage fighters.

368
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,873
Like one person comes out,
one person doesn't.

369
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:37,709
A cock fighting
but with dudes.

370
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,812
- I thought you said they were personal trainers.
- They're dude cock fighters.

371
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,712
Like that thing you see on the pay-per-view.

372
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:45,784
Yes exactly. Except they don't
actually get paid for it.

373
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:47,752
They mostly just brawl 
in people's backyards...

374
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,888
and then they upload
the footage to, YouTube.

375
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:53,688
Honey, my childhood was just
like the, "Shawshank Redemption".

376
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,962
Except I didn't have some kind,
older, soft spoken black man...

377
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,793
to share my struggle with.

378
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,923
But you're not
that child anymore, okay?

379
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:05,663
You're a grown, strong,
confident, successful man.

380
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,804
I really don't want to get into this.

381
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:11,741
Brad, let me just let you know 
the truth. They're intimidated by you.

382
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,778
What you need to do
is go out there...

383
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:14,937
and set some
healthy boundaries...

384
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,649
and demand that they respect 
you. You know what I'm saying?

385
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,852
Hey, big city, come to
open up some presents!

386
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:23,719
- Come on son, we gotta go!
- This is your opportunity.

387
00:20:23,955 --> 00:20:25,718
You can do this, baby.

388
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,855
Right, right.

389
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:33,856
Okay, gentlemen.

390
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,801
Can we take it down
a notch, please?

391
00:20:37,702 --> 00:20:39,871
I'm not a kid, you can't
talk to me like that anymore.

392
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,740
We're adults.
Do you understand?

393
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,833
I'm a grown man
with hair on my chest, right?

394
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,878
There's gonna be certain boundaries 
that are gonna exist between us.

395
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:50,941
They might be invisible. I know you 
gentlemen won't be able to see them,

396
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:54,743
but you're certainly gonna be able 
to respect the fact that they're there.

397
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,718
These boundaries
are not to be crossed.

398
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:01,848
And if they are crossed, there's
gonna be real consequences to that.

399
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:06,831
Thank you.

400
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,670
Welcome back, stud!

401
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,740
Don't!

402
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:16,808
Stop!

403
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,747
Stop it!

404
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:29,988
Come on, can I go in?

405
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:32,824
No, you boys could get hurt.

406
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:33,825
Come in!

407
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,690
- Come on!
- Take us in!

408
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,852
- Go!
- Yes!

409
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:42,700
Get it!

410
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:46,895
Google me, bitch!

411
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:47,933
What?

412
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,937
Google me. You might wanna
look me up sometime, Barbara!

413
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,707
No! Dad!

414
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:54,846
Stop!

415
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,872
Let's open the presents...

416
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:59,746
so, Orlando can get
to his other, christmases alright.

417
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:00,918
Let's do it.

418
00:22:09,794 --> 00:22:10,761
Baby.

419
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,764
It's me. It's me.
Are you okay?

420
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:15,825
Did you break anything?

421
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,702
I am so proud of you.

422
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,798
Orlando, you're closest 
to the tree, you distribute.

423
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:32,951
Gosh, wasn't it so
hard to find gifts...

424
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,748
under the 10 dollar cap this year?

425
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:36,721
The first gift is to, Connor.

426
00:22:36,721 --> 00:22:38,890
- The 10 dollar what?
- 10 dollar spending cap.

427
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,723
Uncle Brad and his special
friend Kate, maybe...

428
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:42,760
Brad?

429
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:44,758
I'll be your nice uncle...

430
00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:46,854
...after you see what I got you.
Go ahead open it up.

431
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,667
- Brad?
- Yeah.

432
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:50,833
What?

433
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:53,738
- X-Box. This is awesome.
- Whoa.

434
00:22:53,738 --> 00:22:54,873
Top shelf for you, pal.

435
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,865
It's got the triple core processor, 
wireless controllers the whole deal.

436
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:59,945
It was a 10 dollar
spending cap.

437
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,846
How in the hell did you find
an X-Box for under 10 dollars?

438
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:06,751
Looks like someone's trying to 
show off how much money he makes.

439
00:23:06,751 --> 00:23:08,877
Maybe someone's family
didn't tell him that,

440
00:23:08,953 --> 00:23:09,921
there was a 10 dollar spending cap.

441
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:12,924
Or maybe if you came home
you'd know crap like that.

442
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:14,926
Guys can we try
to stay positive here?

443
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:17,929
What's the problem? We're trying 
to give some gifts to some children.

444
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:20,799
It's, christmas. Let's keep
the momentum going here.

445
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:25,759
The next gift is to, Cody
and this is from your dad.

446
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,864
I'm sure this is
a good gift too. Okay?

447
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,672
Dig in there, tear it up.

448
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:35,905
A flashlight?

449
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,677
That's it?

450
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,852
Why don't you love me,
Daddy?

451
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:43,955
Okay, okay. Honestly,
I think it's my fault.

452
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:45,923
I didn't know there was 
a 10 dollar spending cap.

453
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,960
Well my gift from, Santa Claus
better be straight cool.

454
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,830
I have a feeling that your
gift from, Santas 

455
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,855
probably going to ring
around 10 dollars too.

456
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,835
Why? Is, Santa Claus
cheap like my daddy?

457
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,702
No, Santa is dad.
Dad is...

458
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:01,906
Right.

459
00:24:02,907 --> 00:24:03,931
I don't understand.

460
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,745
What's happening? What's happening?
What's the problem?

461
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:10,704
There's no, Santa Claus.

462
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:13,883
You're joking with me, right?
You're kidding me.

463
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,754
They know there's
no, Santa Claus, right?

464
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:18,857
They do now.

465
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:20,825
How could you lie to us, Daddy?

466
00:24:20,825 --> 00:24:21,951
There is a Santa Claus.

467
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:22,955
Cody, come on.

468
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:25,754
You and Santa Claus
don't love me.

469
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,833
That's not gonna
bring back Santa. That's not...

470
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,858
When he gets hurt inside
and can't get...

471
00:24:30,935 --> 00:24:33,768
...his emotions into words,
he takes to streaking.

472
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,775
Don't worry, he always comes back.

473
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:39,707
Nobody loves me!

474
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:44,783
Okay, look.
I'm really, really sorry.

475
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:46,717
- I just assumed...
- All right. All right.

476
00:24:46,951 --> 00:24:48,753
Let's keep it moving.

477
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:50,721
I'm starting to lose my balls over here.

478
00:24:50,955 --> 00:24:51,922
All right?

479
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:56,725
What's this one here?
You're gonna love this, poppy.

480
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,726
That's a satellite dish, Howard.

481
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,732
Why would I want a satellite?

482
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,859
That's not a satellite,
it's a satellite dish.

483
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:05,937
Terrific. You got so many more
channels and viewing options.

484
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,802
You don't think I get enough channels?

485
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,975
Well, your TV right now
is a radio, so...

486
00:25:10,975 --> 00:25:11,976
Wait.

487
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:15,707
How much is this gift
gonna cost me a month?

488
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,883
Apparently it's not going to cost you.
We're paying for the services.

489
00:25:18,883 --> 00:25:20,874
- So, nothing actually.
- Wait, wait.

490
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,788
Just because I drive
a combine for a living...

491
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:25,813
doesn't mean I need me
a fancy pants lawyer son...

492
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,959
- paying the bills for me.
- Okay, you win.

493
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,723
If you want to pay, for 
the stuff, you pay for it.

494
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:33,764
The installation guy comes on Tuesday, 
he's gonna install it for you.

495
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,900
Cancel it. We install things 
ourselves in this house.

496
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,838
Dad, I think you gonna want
a professional to handle this.

497
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:42,671
If you think I'll allow
a sex predator...

498
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,900
...in a uniform to wander
around my house...

499
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:46,836
...and touch my underwear...

500
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:50,713
You got another thing coming, no.

501
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:52,910
I'll see you top side in five.

502
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:54,819
All three on the roof.

503
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:55,843
- Let's go.
- Okay.

504
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,714
To her mother.
I gotta take a grumpy.

505
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:02,815
What don't you...?

506
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,795
You wanna go over
to your mom?

507
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:10,792
Yeah, okay, come here.
Careful. There you go.

508
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,667
Ain't it nice to have everybody 
home for the holidays?

509
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:15,933
Yes, it is.

510
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,707
We're gonna make
bologna sandwiches I think.

511
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:26,917
Okay, here we go.

512
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:28,819
Okay.

513
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:30,922
Take her before
it explodes.

514
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:31,889
Thank you.

515
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,759
Gotta go and do
some man's work.

516
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:48,773
You gotta use
a lock nut on that.

517
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,709
I know what I'm doing.
I don't need any lock nut.

518
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:52,911
Sorry, I know that you major...

519
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:55,812
...in a satellite dish
installation at, Stanford.

520
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:58,749
Yeah.

521
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:01,852
Great, dude. Mock me
for being educated. That's awesome.

522
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,784
- Hey, Grandpa!
- Hey!

523
00:27:04,722 --> 00:27:05,848
Come play, war with me!

524
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,892
Maybe later, grandpa is busy.

525
00:27:10,728 --> 00:27:13,697
Grandma's boyfriend
plays with me whenever I want.

526
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:17,702
Your grandmother's boyfriend
is a first class ass sniffer.

527
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:18,828
You can tell him I said so.

528
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,904
Connor, go get us
some beers, man.

529
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:25,910
Sounds like you and mom
really turned a corner there.

530
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:29,814
I don't want to speak ill
of your mother on, christmas.

531
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:30,781
But...

532
00:27:31,749 --> 00:27:32,984
she's nothing but a 
common street whore.

533
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,952
Okay, that's great.
Nicely said.

534
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,655
What?
What do you call a woman...

535
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,858
...who throws away a career,
abandons her kids...

536
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,793
...and runs off
with another man?

537
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,784
- What are you talking about?
- What do you call her?

538
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:46,764
Dad, she was a cashier,
that's not really a career.

539
00:27:46,764 --> 00:27:49,868
That would fall in the category of a job, 
and she left you because you wouldn't talk to her.

540
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:52,937
Stopped spending time with her. You 
completly shut her out of your life.

541
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:56,771
I fed her, I put a roof over her head
and I never lied to her face.

542
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,843
I spoiled her, that's what I did.

543
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,708
Let that be a lesson to you kids...

544
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:02,746
about being honest with your wives.

545
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:06,716
You can't spell "families"
without lies, am I right?

546
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,714
- Amen, Dad.
- Yeah.

547
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:14,724
What is she like...
two or three months?

548
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:17,729
- Nine.
- Wow.

549
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:18,889
- Yeah.
- Nine months.

550
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:22,699
She's not walking or
taking care of herself by now?

551
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:25,737
Are you kidding me?
Most days I'm lucky to get...

552
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:27,796
my boob out of her mouth
so I can shower.

553
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:29,804
- Yeah.
- Does that hurt?

554
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:30,875
What, breast feeding?

555
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:31,842
No.

556
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,812
Maybe at first, but
the nipples get tough.

557
00:28:36,814 --> 00:28:38,748
I can hardly
feel mine anymore.

558
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,680
You wanna flick one?

559
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:42,887
- No.
- Please.

560
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:43,876
- No, no.
- Go ahead.

561
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:47,759
That's okay. I have a set of my 
own. So I'm just gonna pass.

562
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:48,919
- Sure. Of course.
- But thanks.

563
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,691
Okay, we're all set!

564
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,662
Hey!

565
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,763
The picture's all fuzzy.

566
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,970
Did you get me some
sort of cheap old satellite?

567
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,972
No, it's not a cheap
old satellite.

568
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:04,669
I just gotta adjust it.
How about now?

569
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:05,810
Even worse!

570
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:06,936
I can make it work! Hold on!

571
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,646
How about now?

572
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,881
Dad...!

573
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:12,817
Could you hold her?
I need to bake another thing.

574
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:14,785
No, actually... Okay.

575
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,821
Okay.

576
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:18,686
Come on, you can't break her.

577
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:19,891
- Okay.
- Yeah.

578
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:20,915
Okay, you know what...?

579
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:23,886
It's a satellite, you gotta 
point it up at the satellite.

580
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:25,730
How about now, is it better now?

581
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,664
No, it's worse.
It's still crappy.

582
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:29,926
I don't think she likes me.

583
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:31,828
She likes you fine.

584
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,763
Just give her a chance
to warm up to you.

585
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:37,703
- How about now?
- Worse. It's worse.

586
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:38,764
Son of a bitch.

587
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:42,937
Take the damn thing down. I
can do better with my rabbit ears.

588
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:44,773
I love my rabbit ears!

589
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:49,921
Can you tell me "hot or cold".

590
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:51,718
- What?
- Hot or cold.

591
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:55,691
Hot or cold what? What the hell 
does that mean, hot or cold?

592
00:29:56,794 --> 00:29:58,762
How long until
she warms up to me?

593
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,726
Not long at all.

594
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:03,968
- Horrible.
- Point it up!

595
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,770
Shut up, and let me work!

596
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,873
I don't want a fancy satellite.
I don't want any kind of satellite.

597
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:12,673
It's not a satellite, genius!
It's a satellite dish!

598
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:14,678
Okay.

599
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:16,906
- Pull the thing and...
- Get off my roof!

600
00:30:17,915 --> 00:30:19,678
Pull the damn thing!

601
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:34,732
It's too much.

602
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:36,825
Whatever you're doing,
stop it right now!

603
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:38,834
- Leave my TV alone!
- I'm fine!

604
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:42,863
She stopped crying.

605
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:44,840
I did it!

606
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:46,809
You idiot! Stop it!

607
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,805
- This is all right.
- Leave my TV alone!

608
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:53,684
I'm fine.

609
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:55,908
That's awesome.

610
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:57,852
Okay, I'm coming up.

611
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,103
Give me back my baby!

612
00:31:23,881 --> 00:31:24,870
Mistletoe.

613
00:31:28,986 --> 00:31:30,647
Mistletoe.

614
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,930
I can't believe I nailed
that baby's head.

615
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,698
I feel kind of bad about that.

616
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:43,835
That's my brother's kid. You couldn't 
have possibly blown it's, IQ. It's fine.

617
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:45,970
I did get it to stop 
crying there for a second.

618
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,904
I think it kind of liked me.

619
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:49,774
Yeah.

620
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:52,800
Oh my, god! Do you know what happens 
to your nipples after your breast feed?

621
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:54,979
I don't think I wanna know either.

622
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:57,675
No, I don't think you do.
It's violent.

623
00:31:57,915 --> 00:32:00,713
- They crack up like tire rubber.
- Okay.

624
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,851
Just so you know, it's a bit of
a cougar den here at my Mom's.

625
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:12,918
This is different.

626
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:18,667
Maybe she has
a new boyfriend.

627
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:25,910
Merry christmas, mom.

628
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,713
Merry christmas, Kate.
Come on in.

629
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:29,702
Merry christmas.

630
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:34,747
Give me a hug, Kate.

631
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:35,853
Oh, okay.

632
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:38,649
Good to see you.

633
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:39,824
And you must be, Brad.

634
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:40,791
Mrs. Kincaid.

635
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:43,660
Call me, Marilyn 
and get over here...

636
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:45,889
and give me a hug, you big, 
fat, purple teddy bear.

637
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:47,731
Bring it!

638
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:49,766
- Yes, yes!
- Hey, merry christmas.

639
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:52,794
Shit, that feels good.

640
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:56,703
You're so tall and firm
like a giant oak.

641
00:32:57,708 --> 00:32:58,834
He's tall.

642
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:02,936
- Brad, this is my aunt, Sarah.
- Hi.

643
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:04,882
- This is my aunt, Donna.
- Hi.

644
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:07,783
- Is that genuine leather.
- Nice to meet you, ladies.

645
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:10,922
The one in the canarian hanging
on your belt is, gram, gram.

646
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:13,858
I'm sorry, gram, gram, but that's 
my belt. That's attached to me.

647
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:16,793
Sorry, merry christmas to you.
It's a great sweater.

648
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:17,928
I get it.

649
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:23,661
This is the den. Well,
everyone's in here.

650
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:26,871
I can't believe you came.

651
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,873
- Hi, Courtney.
- Hi, sweetie.

652
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:31,709
Hey listen, I can't get up, 
Jackson is very gassy...

653
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:32,944
and I gotta keep
bouncing him.

654
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:33,945
Okay.

655
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:35,879
- Well, this is, Brad.
- Hi.

656
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:37,881
Hi.

657
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:39,643
I'm, Courtney.

658
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:42,681
- Brad. merry christmas.
- merry christmas.

659
00:33:43,754 --> 00:33:44,778
And that's granddad

660
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:47,714
and this is, Courtney's husband, Jim.

661
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,690
- Take, Jackson.
- All right.

662
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:52,727
He's so good with kids.
Yeah.

663
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:54,899
- We're gonna try again.
- Well...

664
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,834
Oh I forgot you're too cool for kids.
It cramps your independence.

665
00:33:57,902 --> 00:34:00,705
I never said, I was too cool for kids.

666
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,940
I know you didn't say it.
But you don't have any.

667
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,774
And you have really strong
concrete ideas about not having any.

668
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:08,775
Well, that's actually not...

669
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:11,681
You know, I'd rather just not get into it.

670
00:34:11,882 --> 00:34:12,849
Where's, Kasi?

671
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:15,909
She's outside in the jump-jump
with the rest of the neighbourhood kids.

672
00:34:16,787 --> 00:34:17,811
There's a jump-jump?

673
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:21,959
Kate always hated the jump-jump.

674
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:25,793
In the 5th grade, bunch of kids trapped
Kate inside the jump-jump.

675
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,699
- She never got over it.
- I got over it.

676
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,758
They tortured her
for about an hour.

677
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,735
Why would they trap 
you in there that long?

678
00:34:33,804 --> 00:34:34,793
Because she was...

679
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,841
"Cootie Kate".

680
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:37,808
Courtney.

681
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:39,765
Who's cootie, Kate?

682
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,947
- She didn't tell you about cootie, Kate?
- Mom, I really don't think this is necessary.

683
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:45,816
All the kids pretended
that, Kate had cooties...

684
00:34:45,816 --> 00:34:47,647
...and no one talked to her.

685
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:49,987
If Kate even touched you,
you'd have to wipe it off...

686
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:52,785
and spray with disinfectant
to get off the cooties.

687
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:55,893
That sounds like it could be really hurtful.
How long did that go along for?

688
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:57,828
Not long. I don't 
remember, but it wasn't long.

689
00:34:57,828 --> 00:34:58,963
Seven years. Until 6th.

690
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,831
That was a long time ago.

691
00:35:00,831 --> 00:35:02,933
I'm sure you don't
have cooties now.

692
00:35:02,933 --> 00:35:03,900
Let's test it out.

693
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:05,669
Ahh... cooties!

694
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:13,944
Pastor Phil has encouraged us to dispense...

695
00:35:13,944 --> 00:35:16,847
with the commercial
trappings of the holidays.

696
00:35:16,847 --> 00:35:18,749
- Who's, Pastor Phil?
- Mom's new beau.

697
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:19,841
It's a whole new thing.

698
00:35:20,851 --> 00:35:21,818
So...

699
00:35:21,952 --> 00:35:24,682
what I had in mind
was that...

700
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:27,725
we would go around 
the room and each of us...

701
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:30,956
would speak to the spiritual
gifts that we might give.

702
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:33,891
A verbal gift giving of sorts.

703
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:36,901
Wait. There's
really no presents.

704
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:37,868
Kasi.

705
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:40,669
None that you can see.

706
00:35:40,871 --> 00:35:41,929
Okay, I'll go first.

707
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:45,876
I would like to give more
of myself to my church...

708
00:35:45,876 --> 00:35:47,741
and to, Pastor Phil.

709
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,841
gram-gram,
would you like to go next?

710
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:58,812
I could increase the frequency
with which...

711
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:02,824
...I pleasure, Milton with
my hand and with my mouth.

712
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:06,725
Did she just say that?

713
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:10,831
Brad, why don't you go next?

714
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,670
I follow, gram, gram with that...

715
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:18,866
...hand stuff and what she
does with her... Yeah, okay?

716
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:20,711
I'd like to umm...

717
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,674
with Kate...

718
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:25,804
would be too...

719
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:30,812
Vacationing more frequently
and doing it with, Kate.

720
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:33,856
That is lovely, Brad.

721
00:36:33,924 --> 00:36:37,862
- He's so well spoken.
- Thank you. Thank you.

722
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,727
Courtney, what would you give?

723
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:41,765
Well, I'd like
to give myself a gift.

724
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:43,891
And that is the gift
of being pregnant.

725
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:48,873
I know that comes with its
own challenges for 9 months...

726
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,740
Iike getting fat and having
people stare at you funny

727
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:52,867
when you sneak a cig, but.

728
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:55,880
I'd also like to give
myself another gift.

729
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,977
And that is a scheduled, 
C-section that goes routinely

730
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:03,752
Don't most women want
to have a natural birth?

731
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,956
Yeah, those women 
who haven't done it before.

732
00:37:05,956 --> 00:37:06,923
Right.

733
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,853
You just come here.

734
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,765
Auntie, Kate will you 
please hold him whilst I..?

735
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:15,833
What do I do?

736
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,802
You gotta hold him.
Okay, got him?

737
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,930
I'll fix myself here.
There we go.

738
00:37:21,705 --> 00:37:23,841
- What should I do with him?
- See if he made a stinky.

739
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:24,830
How do I do that?

740
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,742
Just lift up his diaper
and see if he made one.

741
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:32,713
Oh... Oh yeah there's something in here.

742
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,781
It's a really disgusting...

743
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,787
Jackson...

744
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,781
Your projectile on auntie, Kate.

745
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,962
- I'm gonna vomit.
- Brad, are you okay?

746
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:46,725
Get him some water.

747
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:48,864
- I'm about to throw up.
- Oh, God.

748
00:37:50,734 --> 00:37:51,928
I'll get sick. I can't be here.

749
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,859
What do I do?

750
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:55,906
Take it away from me. 
I'm sorry. I love you.

751
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:57,874
You gotta get out of here. I can't breathe.

752
00:37:58,809 --> 00:37:59,833
I want to do it too!

753
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:01,902
- Kate!
- What?

754
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:10,910
Are you joking me? These are the only 
clothes we have in the entire house?

755
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:12,846
How's that even possible?

756
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:16,750
It's not like you ever come around.
You haven't been here in like... Forever.

757
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:19,730
I can not believe you told him
about "Cootie Kate".

758
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,765
How was I supposed to 
know you hadn't told him?

759
00:38:21,765 --> 00:38:23,868
Like you would tell, Jim you're
"Cootie, Courtney".

760
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,936
Jim and I know everything there 
is to know about each other.

761
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:28,772
He knows I slept with
the entire water polo team.

762
00:38:28,772 --> 00:38:30,797
Just like I know he
experimented with men.

763
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,879
- I didn't need to know that.
- Listen, Kate my point is, after three years...

764
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:36,780
I would think that
you and, Brad...

765
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,873
would know a little bit more about 
each other than you already do.

766
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,945
How can you really appreciate
someone for who they are...

767
00:38:42,786 --> 00:38:43,946
until you really know them?

768
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:51,795
Thank you.

769
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,823
I kind of feel like a
Saudi prince in here.

770
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:57,825
We're just so glad that
Kate has a boyfriend.

771
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:01,701
You're the longest relationship
she's ever had with a man.

772
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:05,809
With a man?

773
00:39:33,837 --> 00:39:34,861
What' is this?

774
00:39:52,856 --> 00:39:53,823
Oh, my God.

775
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:17,681
Who's that?

776
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:18,873
That's, Josephine.

777
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:21,884
Everyone called her, Joe.
She was, Kate's only friend.

778
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,718
Last I heard, Joe coaches
women's wrestling.

779
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:32,796
Check that out!

780
00:40:33,897 --> 00:40:35,762
- That's, Kate?
- Yeah.

781
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:37,825
She looks like, Shaq.

782
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:54,706
Hi, auntie Kate.

783
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,777
- Hi, Kasi.
- What are you doing?

784
00:40:58,922 --> 00:41:01,720
Not much. Do you need
to use the bathroom?

785
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:03,653
What's this?

786
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,858
That is my
special magic marker.

787
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:11,969
What?

788
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,937
We not allowed to have 
magic markers in the house.

789
00:41:13,937 --> 00:41:17,805
- I have to tell my mom.
- No. You don't need to tell your mom.

790
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,866
Actually, can I have it back because...

791
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:23,747
Kasi.

792
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:24,714
You want this?

793
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,707
This is not a joke,
this is not game.

794
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,711
Auntie Kate needs
her marker back, okay?

795
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:34,917
Kasi, this is not funny!

796
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:03,787
Kasi,
please come out of there!

797
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,754
Don't make me
come and get you.

798
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:08,658
Kasi!

799
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:09,891
Come on!

800
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,689
Come and get it!

801
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:35,953
Wait a minute.
Kate went to a fat camp?

802
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:39,719
Yeah, she lost three pounds.
It only took her all summer.

803
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:40,857
A pound a month.

804
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:42,759
Courtney.

805
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:47,697
Kasi, honey. Please
give me back that marker!

806
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:48,932
Keep away!

807
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,771
Come and get it, old lady!

808
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:54,772
What?

809
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:55,898
Keep away! Keep away!

810
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:56,940
Give it to me!

811
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:58,709
"Give it to me."

812
00:42:58,709 --> 00:42:59,943
Just give me the marker.
Okay?

813
00:42:59,943 --> 00:43:02,707
"Just give me the marker.
Okay?"

814
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,738
Come and get it!
Sucker!

815
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:10,820
Get it!

816
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:16,793
Yeah!

817
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:18,952
- That's Kate?
- Yes.

818
00:43:19,696 --> 00:43:21,732
Wait a minute. Hold on.
You told me... Who's that?

819
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:23,825
- That's Kate.
- That's not a boy named, Bjorn?

820
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:37,748
Can't believe it, Kate is
actually playing with, Kasi.

821
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:39,875
I've never seen her
play with my kids before.

822
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,876
Hey! Okay!

823
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:47,781
Mistletoe!

824
00:43:49,726 --> 00:43:51,717
Brad! Mistletoe!

825
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,693
Mistletoe!

826
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:57,767
- We're so glad you're here, Brad.
- I'm having so much fun.

827
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,896
What did she take so long to
bring you here? Is what I wanna know.

828
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:22,723
I came here for a marker...

829
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,724
and I'm not leaving
without one!

830
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:45,882
Kasi!

831
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:51,711
That marker in your mouth,
I peed on it!

832
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:32,662
Hey,hey!

833
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:35,923
Sweetheart you never told me
you went to a fat camp.

834
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:38,702
Okay it was called, "Get fit camp".

835
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:41,671
I can't believe my family is showing 
you all the pictures of my childhood.

836
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:43,706
You know what my favorite ones 
are though, of when you're a baby...

837
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:45,833
'cause it looks almost like you 
were almost meant to be a twin...

838
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,878
- but you ate the other baby in the womb.
- Brad.

839
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:49,880
- That's why you're so powerful.
- Stop.

840
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,816
Because you ate your twin sister,
and you took all of her powers.

841
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:54,681
- Cut it out.
- Baby, I love you.

842
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:58,888
It doesn't bother me if you
were a really abnormally large child...

843
00:45:58,988 --> 00:46:00,789
with lesbian tendencies, 'cause
if that was your journey...

844
00:46:00,857 --> 00:46:03,792
- then I'm cool with it.
- What are you saying, lesbian tendencies?

845
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:06,852
- I saw the pictures of, Joe.
- Joe wasn't gay.

846
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:10,867
Haircuts don't lie.
What did you do with Joe...

847
00:46:10,867 --> 00:46:12,970
Iike play baseball
and ride motorcycles?

848
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,839
We're just kids.
She was really imaginative.

849
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,875
We played in the basement.
She had this game: "Sun tan".

850
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:21,778
We pretended we're on the
beach, she'd take lotion...

851
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:23,905
she never wanted me 
to burn, so she would rub it...

852
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:28,718
Okay, listen and look 
at me. You're better kisser for it.

853
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:32,856
All I'm saying to you is, it's not fun when
the shoes on the other foot, right.

854
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:34,925
You shouldn't have been so shitty 
with me with the whole, Orlando stuff.

855
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:37,894
when you have so many
skeletons in your own closet, right.

856
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:41,721
Do not throw rocks when
you live in the house of, Joe.

857
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:42,921
Okay, I see your point.

858
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,730
I love you.
I'll see you in a little bit.

859
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:51,808
Mom.

860
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,945
I really need to talk
to you for a sec.

861
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:58,642
Kate, I don't have time for this. I don't
wanna be late for, Pastor Phil.

862
00:46:58,715 --> 00:46:59,682
But I just...

863
00:46:59,916 --> 00:47:01,718
But I just... I kinda want 
to talk about this now.

864
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:04,778
Well if it's important now, it'll be
important after church, right?

865
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:06,957
Well yeah but...

866
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:09,858
Clean yourself up a little,
this is a nice church.

867
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:23,840
And now...

868
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:28,838
...the, Pastor Phil!

869
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:32,910
Hello. There's a new born King.
Hallelujah!

870
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:35,713
Hallelujah!

871
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:37,851
Praise Him!
Hallelujah!

872
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:41,824
Praise Him! Praise Him!
Talk to Him, lady!

873
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:45,694
Glory to the new born King!

874
00:47:46,963 --> 00:47:48,692
Hallelujah!

875
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:52,891
Please be seated.

876
00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:58,704
I've been given a note.

877
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:00,877
The, Walshes who
performed the role...

878
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:03,780
of, Mary and Joseph
for the last three years...

879
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,141
and done a great job of it, they had 
some food that didn't agree with them.

880
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:08,718
So, we're gonna need 
a pair of volunteers...

881
00:48:08,718 --> 00:48:10,743
to perform the roles
of, Mary and Joseph.

882
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:15,780
You should do it.

883
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:16,791
What?

884
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:19,830
No, I won't get in front
of a bunch of strangers.

885
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:22,822
You're staged trained. You
played Pippin in High School.

886
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:25,935
No. I wasn't Pippin,
I was in Pippin.

887
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:29,773
I played a tree because I had a bad 
stage fright, do you remember this?

888
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:32,867
I know this seems like I'm putting you
on the spot and in fact I am.

889
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:35,804
Honey, Pastor Phil needs you.

890
00:48:36,746 --> 00:48:38,815
- I'm not gonna do it.
- Do I have a volunteer?

891
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:40,715
Or do I still need
a volunteer?

892
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:43,954
Kate will play
the, Virgin Mary.

893
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:44,955
What?

894
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:46,957
Hallelujah! The cure of the world!

895
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:48,754
I just said I wouldn't.

896
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:51,792
Hallelujah! Kate, you stand up!

897
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:52,919
Stand up, please!

898
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:56,800
Look at the joy you've brought
to this congregation, Kate...

899
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,768
by your volunteering
to be, Mary.

900
00:48:58,768 --> 00:49:00,861
Hello. I still need a, Joseph.

901
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:03,828
Brad be, Joseph.

902
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:06,743
I'm not staged trained.
I never played Pippin.

903
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:08,836
You don't have to give the performance.
You just have to get up there.

904
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:11,779
- because I don't wanna be alone.
- It's not gonna happen.

905
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:12,906
Oh rub a pon-pon, Brad, you stand up!

906
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:15,782
You are a part of this, Brad!

907
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:37,772
Listen to me, Brad. I'm going to really 
need you to look out for me up there.

908
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:40,777
Because I'm starting
to get like really nervous.

909
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:42,836
- That stage fright thing.
- How do I look?

910
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:46,876
- What do you think?
- You look fine. I'm trying to get...

911
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:49,680
My man's skirt, is it
short or is it okay?

912
00:49:49,819 --> 00:49:50,877
- Honestly.
- It's a little short.

913
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:52,888
Okay here's, Jesus.

914
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,753
They don't use a doll?

915
00:49:56,726 --> 00:49:58,694
- Here are your scripts.
- Scripts?

916
00:49:58,828 --> 00:50:00,853
- I'm not ready for scripts...
- Hi, Jesus.

917
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:02,862
No one ever told me
there's gonna be lines...

918
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:05,735
- Hi, Jesus.
- Actually, his name's, Bernard.

919
00:50:05,735 --> 00:50:07,737
Okay.
Hi, Bernard.

920
00:50:07,737 --> 00:50:10,774
Okay, I got lines. I gotta
try to get my voice ready.

921
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:13,843
Red leather. Yellow leather.
Red leather. Yellow webber.

922
00:50:13,843 --> 00:50:15,640
This is a good baby.

923
00:50:15,845 --> 00:50:17,642
Look at this baby.

924
00:50:17,847 --> 00:50:20,748
Baby, baby Jesus
is really kind of cute.

925
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:23,749
This child is a blessing
to the both of us.

926
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:24,921
Really?

927
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:27,881
What, do you think
I should do it bigger?

928
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:31,655
Should I do it maybe like, "This child's
a blessing for the both of us.

929
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:32,963
But not angry. Inspired.

930
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:35,898
Oh, my God. There's so many
different ways to play this thing.

931
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:37,968
Can I ask you
a question seriously?

932
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:40,770
My wife is pregnant,
but it's not my child.

933
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:43,705
But do you think I'm cool with it because
god's the one that got her pregnant?

934
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:49,645
Are we ready
to see the result...

935
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,647
of that immaculate conception?

936
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:53,645
Hallelujah!

937
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,742
Brad, I don't feel good.

938
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:57,787
Maybe you should
hold the baby.

939
00:50:57,787 --> 00:50:59,856
Sweetheart, I gotta get ready.

940
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:02,654
Just remember,
acting is reacting.

941
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:05,657
And Joseph and Mary,
went up from, Galilee...

942
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:06,957
and out of the city
of, Nazareth.

943
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:11,656
Okay, find your truth.
I'll blow the roof of this bitch.

944
00:51:17,807 --> 00:51:18,774
Brad.

945
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:20,744
I can't do this.

946
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,871
Check it out, baby.
They're digging my walk.

947
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:34,813
Because there was no room in 
the inn, they stayed in the stable.

948
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:40,697
And Mary wrapped the baby
in swaddling clothes...

949
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:41,891
and placed him
in a manger.

950
00:51:52,942 --> 00:51:55,979
And Mary wrapped the baby
in swaddling clothes...

951
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:58,709
and placed him in a manger.

952
00:52:01,951 --> 00:52:03,748
Put it, in it.

953
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:07,891
Brad, help me swaddle.

954
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:09,916
I've gotta save my line,
we're losing the audience.

955
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:11,756
It's deadlier out there.

956
00:52:11,861 --> 00:52:12,828
Come on, Mary!

957
00:52:15,865 --> 00:52:18,698
This child is a blessing
to the both of us.

958
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:20,770
Amen!

959
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:22,862
That's right!

960
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:27,910
Your line.

961
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:31,781
I forgot my line.

962
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:33,681
- What?
- I forgot my line.

963
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:35,908
Thank goodness
I memorize yours too.

964
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:38,880
We shall name him, Jesus.

965
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:42,725
Glory to, god!

966
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:46,953
And peace on earth
to the highest point on earth!

967
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:53,828
This thing isn't big
enough to swaddle him.

968
00:52:53,903 --> 00:52:55,939
Someone's got to give
a performance.

969
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:58,806
I'm nervous. I can't feel my
legs. Please don't do this to me.

970
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:00,866
It'd appear that my wife is better at...

971
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:04,805
making babies than
swaddling them, no? Yes?

972
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:11,687
Brad, you're wearing the
swaddle cloth on your belt.

973
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:15,816
Woman, do your job
and swaddle this baby!

974
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:19,696
Brad, I can't. You're wearing
the swaddle around your belt!

975
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:22,766
Enough! This child's
life is now in jeopardy.

976
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:25,758
Unfit mother, give me this baby.

977
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:33,766
And l, Joseph,
shall swaddle this baby!

978
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:38,908
And l, Joseph,
will protect this child.

979
00:53:39,949 --> 00:53:41,712
Forgive her, son...

980
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:46,685
for she knows not
what she's done!

981
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:53,829
Yeah!

982
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:02,905
Hallelujah!

983
00:54:02,972 --> 00:54:04,940
That's the message
of, christmas.

984
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:07,834
Hallelujah!

985
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:12,873
Hallelujah!

986
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,648
Brad, that was...!

987
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:22,815
# All is calm #

988
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:26,719
# All is bright #

989
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:33,859
# Round young
Virgin Mother and Child #

990
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:40,768
# Holy infant
so tender and mild #

991
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:43,805
I know how, Celine Dion
feels after one of those shows,

992
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,982
because she gives so much, it's not like
you're getting a lot back.

993
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:48,918
- 'cause I got a lot back to.
- Celine Dion. You feel like, Celine Dion?

994
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:50,954
How do you calm down
of a such a high?

995
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,785
It's difficult to do that.

996
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:54,891
I can't believe you threw me down...

997
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:56,756
in front of the entire congregation.

998
00:54:56,826 --> 00:54:58,152
You were just thinking 
about yourself up there.

999
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:00,730
I was thinking about
the entire show.

1000
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:01,898
And quite frankly 
with you, Kate, I think I...

1001
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:03,766
I brought the whole thing home.

1002
00:55:03,766 --> 00:55:04,755
- My God.
- I did.

1003
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:06,870
- ls this how it's gonna be with us?
- ls this how it's gonna... What's..?

1004
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:08,938
- What are you saying?
- I'd like to know...

1005
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:10,874
you'll be there for me in a crisis.

1006
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:12,909
If we're on a plane,
and it  was going down.

1007
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:14,711
and I was passed out and I say,

1008
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:15,837
"Everyone needs to put 
on your oxygen mask."

1009
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:18,881
I would like to know that were gonna 
put mine on before you put your own. You know?

1010
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:22,750
I wouldn't and the, FAA wouldn't
want me to do it either.

1011
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,888
- I'm not... FAA?
- lf you'd listen...

1012
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:26,947
- What?
- Do you ever listen to the stewardesses?

1013
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:29,954
Or are you too busy moving your, BlackBerry 
and having them tell you to shut it off?

1014
00:55:30,693 --> 00:55:32,820
- I listen to the stewardesses.
- When they say...

1015
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:35,888
...that you're supposed to put
your mask on in case of an emergency...

1016
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:37,933
before you try to help out a child 
or an unfit adult next to you.

1017
00:55:38,701 --> 00:55:39,969
- I've heard her.
- Because lf you pass out...

1018
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:42,872
you're not helping anybody.
"Put the mask on this one."

1019
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:45,708
Now I'm passed out. Now I'm 
not living I won't help anybody.

1020
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:46,766
It's not the point I'm trying to make.

1021
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,945
What is the point? Sweetheart I'm 
sorry, maybe I got this wrong.

1022
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:50,674
What's your point?

1023
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:54,918
I feel like we're not really connecting.
It's like you're not even present.

1024
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:57,716
I have been present.
I've been here all day.

1025
00:55:57,887 --> 00:55:59,855
We've been doing things
alongside each other

1026
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:02,653
but I'd like for us to do
somethings together.

1027
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:05,723
Kate, I that you're upset
with your family...

1028
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:07,695
and I think you're 
taking it out on me.

1029
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:09,732
They've been
my family for years.

1030
00:56:09,732 --> 00:56:12,701
This is not about my family,
this is about you and me.

1031
00:56:12,835 --> 00:56:13,802
I just...

1032
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:16,199
I just want something different for us.

1033
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:18,840
- Merry christmas.
- Mom!

1034
00:56:19,842 --> 00:56:21,911
- God I've missed you!
- Good to see you, Mom!

1035
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:22,935
It's been so long.

1036
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:25,915
- And you must be, Kate.
- Yes.

1037
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:28,647
She's a darling.

1038
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:31,721
- Thank you. Nice to meet you.
- Oh It's so wonderful to meet you.

1039
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,790
- Should I call you...
- Just call me, Paula.

1040
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:34,814
- Just, Paula.
- Okay.

1041
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:36,949
I am so glad you came.

1042
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:39,818
You've been
taking good care of him.

1043
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,731
Certainly hasn't missed many meals.

1044
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:43,733
- That's great.
- He likes a snack.

1045
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,735
- I do like the snack.
- Yes, he does.

1046
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:46,793
Come on in and relax.

1047
00:56:46,869 --> 00:56:49,772
I've fixed all of your
favorite dishes, Bradford.

1048
00:56:49,772 --> 00:56:51,774
Denver and Susan
are watching TV.

1049
00:56:51,774 --> 00:56:53,876
Let's sit here and 
catch up for a minute.

1050
00:56:53,876 --> 00:56:55,935
- Your house is beautiful.
- Oh thank you.

1051
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:57,747
This is gorgeous.

1052
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,849
Well you knew, Bradford lived
with me after the divorce.

1053
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:02,785
Denver and Dallas were more
comfortable with, Howard.

1054
00:57:02,785 --> 00:57:04,946
But, Bradford was
the more sensitive type.

1055
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:07,724
- Okay you know I was thinking...
- Oh we were just best friends.

1056
00:57:07,724 --> 00:57:08,782
Just inseparable.

1057
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:11,828
My god, he breastfed
until he was five.

1058
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:13,830
Thought l was going to have
to take you to college.

1059
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:14,897
Okay, I think 
we've had enough...

1060
00:57:14,897 --> 00:57:16,899
The only one who 
was on my tits more...

1061
00:57:16,899 --> 00:57:18,835
was a professor that 
I dated after his father.

1062
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:20,703
Could you not say "tits", please?

1063
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:23,729
- Hey, kids.
- Okay this is, Darryl.

1064
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:25,702
Hi, nice to meet you.

1065
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,800
It is so nice to meet you,
young lady.

1066
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:31,781
And always great
to see you, big guy.

1067
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,806
Hey, how was traffic
getting out here, huh?

1068
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:37,647
You know what, can I get your gas 
money? I'd like to get your gas money.

1069
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,922
Actually, I don't need you
to get my gas money.

1070
00:57:39,922 --> 00:57:41,924
Thank you. I actually make
a lot more than you do.

1071
00:57:41,924 --> 00:57:44,916
- So, no thank you.
- Bradford, be nice.

1072
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:46,919
It's okay, sweetie.

1073
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:50,933
Look...

1074
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:52,835
Brad...

1075
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,872
I'm not trying
to be your father.

1076
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:56,930
You already got one of those.

1077
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:00,835
I'm just hoping for a 
chance to be your friend.

1078
00:58:01,844 --> 00:58:04,745
You were my friend, Darryl.
You were my best friend.

1079
00:58:04,947 --> 00:58:06,916
We grew up together,
we rode bikes together.

1080
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,918
we used to smell
each other's hands.

1081
00:58:08,918 --> 00:58:11,682
But now you're sleeping with my 
mom and it's a little bit weird for me

1082
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:12,846
can you appreciate that?

1083
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:15,925
I never had a sexual thought
about your mom until I was 30.

1084
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:18,828
Can you leave it alone. You can't 
be my friend anymore.

1085
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:20,830
You can't be sleeping
with my mom...

1086
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:23,764
- and still be my friend, okay?
- I'm thirsty, is anybody else thirsty?

1087
00:58:23,832 --> 00:58:24,834
Kate, what can
I get you to drink?

1088
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:25,968
- I'm good.
- Look, your mother...

1089
00:58:25,968 --> 00:58:28,801
- is a very sexual being, Bradford.
- She's a very what?

1090
00:58:28,871 --> 00:58:29,972
She's a great lover.

1091
00:58:29,972 --> 00:58:32,842
Say that again and I'm gonna 
bust your mouth open.

1092
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:35,936
Hey, look it. This is, christmas
and we're not gonna go there.

1093
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,881
Kate has been kind enough
to send us some games.

1094
00:58:38,881 --> 00:58:41,907
We are gonna play them
and we're gonna have fun. Okay?

1095
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:52,962
Why are you staring at me 
when you eat the wings?

1096
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:54,862
That's... uncomfortable.

1097
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,702
Oh, Conner honey 
don't eat those brownies.

1098
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:01,727
Those are grandmothers
special brownies.

1099
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:04,941
Kate, could you be a lamb
and explain the rules?

1100
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:07,842
Of course. So, you try to
get your team mate...

1101
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:09,779
to say the word
on the top of the card...

1102
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:11,804
but you can't say any 
of the words listed beneath.

1103
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:13,916
And if you say any
of the taboo words...

1104
00:59:13,916 --> 00:59:15,816
- then you get buzzed.
- Okay.

1105
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:17,687
That makes sense?

1106
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:19,956
I'm so excited to have you
all here to play this game together.

1107
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:21,724
It's gonna be so much fun.

1108
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,715
Hey, it's good to have
my friend back.

1109
00:59:25,828 --> 00:59:27,697
So, who wants to go first?

1110
00:59:27,697 --> 00:59:28,698
- I'll go.
- Okay.

1111
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:30,689
Brad, why don't you
buzz your mom...

1112
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:32,835
- and then I'll do the timer.
- Okay.

1113
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:33,802
Thanks.

1114
00:59:35,805 --> 00:59:37,796
On your mark, get set, go!

1115
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:41,775
Okay, this is a town in, France.

1116
00:59:41,944 --> 00:59:42,945
What?

1117
00:59:42,945 --> 00:59:45,641
- You can't say, "France" it's on the.
- You don't have to buzz me like that, Brad.

1118
00:59:45,715 --> 00:59:46,916
It's the same, loud for everybody.

1119
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,781
It's okay sweetie, just 
do the next card.

1120
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:51,754
Okay.

1121
00:59:51,954 --> 00:59:53,785
This is me, I'm a...

1122
00:59:53,956 --> 00:59:54,957
Cradle robber.

1123
00:59:54,957 --> 00:59:56,857
- What did he say?
- Keep going.

1124
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,860
Don't worry about it.
You're a therapist, keep going.

1125
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:01,964
- No, no, not Capricorn but...
- a, Libra.

1126
01:00:01,964 --> 01:00:02,931
Yes!

1127
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:05,734
It's fun.

1128
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:07,770
Okay.

1129
01:00:08,704 --> 01:00:09,898
This is what you dripped on me?

1130
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:11,839
Ohh, wax!

1131
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:12,932
No, after that.

1132
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:15,677
It's brown.

1133
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:16,913
Okay make this stop, please.

1134
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:17,914
Ohh, oh, chocolate.

1135
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:19,848
- No, before that! After the wax!
- Oh my god.

1136
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:22,751
- The syrup!
- Yes!

1137
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,911
Way sticky dude, I 
would not recommend that.

1138
01:00:26,722 --> 01:00:27,746
- Okay.
- Okay, time.

1139
01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:28,952
Time.

1140
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:31,717
- Good job. Good job.
- We only got two.

1141
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:32,886
Who wants to go next?

1142
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:34,793
- We'll go.
- Okay, great.

1143
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:36,822
I'll do the buzzer.

1144
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,826
Are you gonna actually 
eat while you play that?

1145
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:42,939
- Just flip the tube.
- Excuse me?

1146
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:43,928
Flip the tube.

1147
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:46,832
Okay. On your mark,
get set, go!

1148
01:00:47,844 --> 01:00:49,779
- Capital of, China.
- Hong Kong.

1149
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:50,746
Yes.

1150
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:52,872
Thing next to your bed
on the night stand.

1151
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:53,881
- A sock.
- Yes.

1152
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:57,820
I helped you come up
with this, when you were drunk...

1153
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,913
and came home from
the bar last, thursday.

1154
01:01:00,756 --> 01:01:01,723
- Alibi.
- Yes.

1155
01:01:02,725 --> 01:01:04,955
Alright, the thing I'm not
allowed to wear to, supercross.

1156
01:01:05,695 --> 01:01:06,684
- Mini skirt.
- Yes!

1157
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:09,688
Me and you dry humping
on the beach.

1158
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:11,860
- A screensaver.
- Yes, baby!

1159
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:13,731
This game is so easy.

1160
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:16,862
The only man I'm allowed
to cheat on you with.

1161
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:18,898
- John Grisham.
- Yes!

1162
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:22,712
- Mexican dude.
- Ricardo Montealban.

1163
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:23,679
- Yes!
- Time.

1164
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:26,677
- Right here. Right here!
- Come on!

1165
01:01:28,784 --> 01:01:30,853
Okay, this is like
an animal attack video.

1166
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,889
Guys there's other people 
on this table, uncomfortable.

1167
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:34,652
Stop. Oh, God.

1168
01:01:35,691 --> 01:01:37,716
You guys got a lot.
How many was that?

1169
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:38,861
- Seven.
- Seven.

1170
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,761
- Pollie, can you do the buzzer?
- Oh, yeah!

1171
01:01:40,897 --> 01:01:42,832
We can do this, baby.
You ready?

1172
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:43,833
Yeah.

1173
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:45,735
Okay let's light a fire. Let's light a fire.

1174
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:47,669
- Ready? Go!
- Okay.

1175
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:49,805
This is the thing, I'm most 
scared of in the whole world.

1176
01:01:49,805 --> 01:01:50,873
- Snakes.
- No, no, no.

1177
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,843
- The thing I'm most scared of.
- Jump-jumps! 4 year-olds.

1178
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:55,868
More than anything, this
scares me to my core.

1179
01:01:55,945 --> 01:01:58,709
You got to come up with 
a differnet... Use a lifeline.

1180
01:01:58,848 --> 01:02:00,782
- Ask the audience
- Spiders, Brad. I'm scared of spiders.

1181
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:02,852
Sweetheart, you don't 
have to say the answer.

1182
01:02:02,852 --> 01:02:06,652
You can say an "eight-legged
animal" or a "superhero"...

1183
01:02:06,722 --> 01:02:08,925
- Can't say superhero!
- Mom, I'm not actually the one with the...

1184
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:09,892
Try again.

1185
01:02:10,826 --> 01:02:13,659
Okay, in high-school,
my senior year spring break...

1186
01:02:13,729 --> 01:02:16,799
I was in Cancun, and I was wearing 
this bikini top, I'd lost all this weight...

1187
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,824
- Tourists. Skinny.
- No, no, no.

1188
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:20,803
- Thin?
- No, I was standing at the bar.

1189
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:22,772
- I was shaking around...
- Dancer.

1190
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:24,874
- My stuff fell out and then all the bar tenders...
- Your what fell out?

1191
01:02:24,874 --> 01:02:25,942
My stuff fell out.

1192
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:28,711
Everybody would call me 
when I went to the bar and say

1193
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:29,735
"Oh, here comes..."

1194
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:33,938
Peek-a-boo.

1195
01:02:35,851 --> 01:02:36,852
Peek-a-boo.

1196
01:02:36,852 --> 01:02:39,755
Okay, honey, you can say,
like, "look" or...

1197
01:02:39,755 --> 01:02:41,857
- Can't say "look".
- Okay, mom I'm not the one with the card.

1198
01:02:41,857 --> 01:02:43,960
I'm giving examples.
I have a thing here.

1199
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,757
- You see this...
- Can't say, "see"!

1200
01:02:45,828 --> 01:02:46,963
I'm explaining the game.

1201
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:48,658
Can't say "game"!

1202
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:50,926
Mom, the answer's been said.
She said the answer.

1203
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:52,902
- Let's just do the next one.
- Okay.

1204
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:54,837
- Let's... you know?
- I get it.

1205
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:57,863
Okay, so this is something
that you would eat...

1206
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:00,843
- and you put it on a barbecue and...
- Chicken.

1207
01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:01,867
- It's my favorite.
- Beef.

1208
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:02,979
You can't say, "beef"!

1209
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:04,810
Mom, I'm not the 
one saying the things!

1210
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,783
- Do you get that? Just shush.
- You can't say, "shush."

1211
01:03:07,783 --> 01:03:08,909
Okay, Mom,
I can say "shush."

1212
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:10,885
- You can't say "shush."
- Okay Lets just move on... Kebab.

1213
01:03:11,787 --> 01:03:12,776
It's kebab.

1214
01:03:12,888 --> 01:03:14,824
It says I can't say "shish"!

1215
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:16,951
Shish. Shish. Shish.

1216
01:03:17,693 --> 01:03:18,819
And I could say it, 
because, I don't have it.

1217
01:03:18,894 --> 01:03:21,831
and that's why, there's this thing
here so that I can't see what it is.

1218
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:23,696
Let's just move on.
Let's just move on.

1219
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:25,834
Our time's up.

1220
01:03:28,704 --> 01:03:29,805
What's this attitude, Brad?

1221
01:03:29,805 --> 01:03:31,774
I don't have an attitude.
I've shut down.

1222
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:33,909
She buzzes me,
I'm trying to explain to you...

1223
01:03:33,909 --> 01:03:35,945
how to play the game, you 
obviously don't understand

1224
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:38,743
the best ways to play the
game and I'm shutting down.

1225
01:03:56,766 --> 01:03:58,757
I wanna talk to you
about something.

1226
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:01,904
Baby, I know what you want 
to talk to me, about me.

1227
01:04:01,904 --> 01:04:02,905
You do?

1228
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:05,703
I don't want you to apologize
for it because, love...

1229
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:08,676
means never having to say that your, 
sorry. You know what I mean?

1230
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:10,644
For the record,
I do forgive you.

1231
01:04:10,913 --> 01:04:12,847
But the thing is when you're
playing a board game...

1232
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:16,719
you shouldn't go so conceptual, 
you do want to go a lot more literal.

1233
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:17,845
- Look how else will you know...?
- No, Brad.

1234
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,854
I took a pregnancy test today.

1235
01:04:20,856 --> 01:04:21,880
You took what?

1236
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:24,759
I took a pregnancy test today.

1237
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:27,863
At my mom's house.
It was in my sister's bag...

1238
01:04:27,863 --> 01:04:29,797
I was in the bathroom, and
I'd been a couple of days late

1239
01:04:29,865 --> 01:04:32,768
so I just thought I should
probably take a test.

1240
01:04:32,768 --> 01:04:34,870
- Honey, you pulled the goalie?
- What?

1241
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:38,039
You can't pull the goalie without checking 
with your team mate, this is insane.

1242
01:04:38,139 --> 01:04:39,908
I did not pull the goalie. That's not
what this conversation is about.

1243
01:04:39,975 --> 01:04:41,943
What are you talking about? 
What am I missing here?

1244
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:44,947
Relax, Brad. It was negative.
I'm not pregnant.

1245
01:04:44,947 --> 01:04:47,917
Well jeez, why don't you just hit
me with that right from the start?

1246
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:50,953
Instead of making me take laps
around the anxiety pool.

1247
01:04:50,953 --> 01:04:52,788
What is this reaction?

1248
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:54,756
Listen, If there's one 
thing we've learned

1249
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:56,724
by being forced to being
around our families today

1250
01:04:56,792 --> 01:04:58,851
it's about the dangers
of procreating.

1251
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:01,897
Besides, that's not the 
things that we want in life.

1252
01:05:01,897 --> 01:05:03,833
Brad, I realized it today.

1253
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:05,698
I thought for sure, I'd 
always known that

1254
01:05:05,768 --> 01:05:07,870
I didn't want to have kids
and I took this test,

1255
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:09,939
I'm waiting to see if it's
positive or negative

1256
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:11,930
and I thought, 
for just a second. I felt...

1257
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:15,743
different. You know?
I felt hopeful.

1258
01:05:15,911 --> 01:05:17,746
Like maybe it would 
just happen and

1259
01:05:17,746 --> 01:05:20,772
we'd be forced to get 
over all of our fears.

1260
01:05:21,684 --> 01:05:22,918
We have spent so 
much of our relationship 

1261
01:05:22,918 --> 01:05:25,754
creating all these boundaries you 
know, and making sure that 

1262
01:05:25,754 --> 01:05:27,923
we don't limit ourselves
with responsibility...

1263
01:05:27,923 --> 01:05:30,687
and obligation, and I don't 
wanna live like that anymore.

1264
01:05:30,759 --> 01:05:31,885
Because that's not loving at all.

1265
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:34,830
- ls that an eighties song?
- No, Brad.

1266
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:37,833
- Your throwing, eighties songs at me?
- I'm tired of being one foot in.

1267
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:39,824
I want us to be open,
to love each other...

1268
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:41,937
however it's going to be.
and if one day that means...

1269
01:05:41,937 --> 01:05:43,973
we get married or
if we have kids one day

1270
01:05:43,973 --> 01:05:46,942
I feel like that's okay.
I wanna be in a relationship...

1271
01:05:47,776 --> 01:05:49,710
that goes where 
it needs to go.

1272
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:52,815
Okay. And I'd like the 
relationship to go to, Fiji.

1273
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:55,943
Brad, this is very important.
I wanna have this conversation.

1274
01:05:56,685 --> 01:05:58,888
I don't want to have this conversation.
I don't wanna have it.

1275
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:00,956
I feel the same way that
I did when we first met,

1276
01:06:00,956 --> 01:06:02,719
and I've been honest 
the whole time.

1277
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:04,827
I don't want a 
conversation about it

1278
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:06,795
because I don't 
want those things.

1279
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:12,901
Okay.

1280
01:06:40,896 --> 01:06:42,761
It's okay, you 
don't have to come in.

1281
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:47,664
Sweetheart, I'm not going to make 
you go into the house by yourself.

1282
01:06:47,736 --> 01:06:49,670
I'm fine. I'll just have my sister
drive me back to the city.

1283
01:06:49,738 --> 01:06:51,707
We'll go in there together
and I'll drive you home.

1284
01:06:51,707 --> 01:06:52,867
I'm not gonna go
and in there and pretend

1285
01:06:52,942 --> 01:06:55,843
we're something that we're 
not, Brad. I can't do that anymore.

1286
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:57,846
Baby, listen to me, please.

1287
01:06:57,846 --> 01:06:59,882
Okay let's not over 
react to this situation here.

1288
01:06:59,882 --> 01:07:02,749
I'm not over 
reacting, Brad. I get it.

1289
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:04,914
I'm the one changing
the rules.

1290
01:07:05,821 --> 01:07:08,813
and If you don't want to change
them with me, I understand.

1291
01:07:10,726 --> 01:07:12,660
I just can't do this anymore.

1292
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:45,694
Honey?

1293
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:46,928
Coming in?

1294
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:50,722
Hey, Dad.

1295
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:52,823
She made it!

1296
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:55,669
Auntie, Kate!
Auntie, Kate!

1297
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:56,905
Merry christmas again!

1298
01:07:56,905 --> 01:07:58,807
Hi, Kasi.
Merry christmas.

1299
01:07:58,807 --> 01:08:01,708
Come see the cool stuff
grandpa, Creighton got me!

1300
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:02,709
Okay.

1301
01:08:03,812 --> 01:08:05,948
Hi, I'm, Cheryl. I'm
your dad's girlfriend.

1302
01:08:05,948 --> 01:08:08,678
- Nice to finally meet you.
- Excuse me.

1303
01:08:09,818 --> 01:08:10,953
- Hey, Kate!
- Hi, Mom.

1304
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:13,922
I got a, Dora the Explorer backpack...

1305
01:08:14,957 --> 01:08:18,794
a matching, Dora thermos,
a big girl necklace...

1306
01:08:18,794 --> 01:08:19,928
and princess shoes!

1307
01:08:19,928 --> 01:08:21,691
Hey, guys!

1308
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,664
Hi, Auntie, Kate.
Where's, Brad?

1309
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:28,804
Kasi, why don't you go
tell grandpa thanks...

1310
01:08:28,804 --> 01:08:29,938
for all your new toys?

1311
01:08:29,938 --> 01:08:32,708
You'd better go or
I'm going to tickle.

1312
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:33,675
Go!

1313
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:37,936
This is amazing.

1314
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:39,875
Dad and Mom
in the same room?

1315
01:08:39,982 --> 01:08:41,745
They hated each other.

1316
01:08:41,817 --> 01:08:45,810
Well they've been getting together
for stuff since, Kasi turned one.

1317
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,725
It must be really nice
for, Kasi.

1318
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,694
It's really nice for everyone.

1319
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:59,868
- Where is, Brad?
- He's not going to make it.

1320
01:08:59,868 --> 01:09:01,737
But, If it's all the 
same to everybody

1321
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:03,872
I'd really just rather
not talk about it.

1322
01:09:03,872 --> 01:09:05,931
- I'm sorry. I didn't realize...
- It's okay.

1323
01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:09,712
It's not something I want
to get into right now.

1324
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:10,906
Sorry, we won't talk about him.

1325
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:17,650
I have a great idea!
Internet dating.

1326
01:09:17,886 --> 01:09:19,144
You should do it. It's great.

1327
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:21,883
You just pay 20 bucks,
and you put in your profile.

1328
01:09:21,957 --> 01:09:24,827
Susan, next door, did it and she 
found her husband that way.

1329
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:25,828
It's great.

1330
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:27,819
He doesn't have a job
yet but they're working on it.

1331
01:09:27,896 --> 01:09:28,954
You should totally do it!

1332
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:31,665
- I'll think about that.
- Yes.

1333
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,699
I'm gonna take a 
minute and just.

1334
01:09:33,902 --> 01:09:36,700
Okay. I got your back.
Gotcha.

1335
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:37,906
Thanks.

1336
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:03,830
Hi, kiddo.

1337
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:06,723
Hey, Dad.

1338
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:12,908
Did, Brad leave 
to get a jumpstart

1339
01:10:12,908 --> 01:10:14,876
on inoculating babies
in, Burma?

1340
01:10:15,944 --> 01:10:16,945
What?

1341
01:10:16,945 --> 01:10:18,879
Maybe he's making
sock monkeys

1342
01:10:18,947 --> 01:10:20,812
for foster kids.

1343
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:23,844
Or weaving ponchos
for pregnant women

1344
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:24,943
in the, Yucatan?

1345
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,892
So, I guess you knew
we were lying?

1346
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:30,859
Oh, boy.

1347
01:10:31,927 --> 01:10:34,963
Unfortunately, I've had
a lot of experience

1348
01:10:34,963 --> 01:10:38,797
bending the truth
to avoid my family.

1349
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:42,928
And I'll tell you, honey.
I would give anything...

1350
01:10:43,939 --> 01:10:46,873
to have that time
back again.

1351
01:10:48,844 --> 01:10:49,833
I would too.

1352
01:10:53,882 --> 01:10:55,816
It's taken me a lot of years

1353
01:10:56,885 --> 01:10:59,945
and several divorces
to learn that

1354
01:11:01,857 --> 01:11:03,916
nothing really beats
being honest.

1355
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:08,727
Honest about who you are,
what you need...

1356
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:11,661
all the rest tends
to work itself out.

1357
01:11:14,803 --> 01:11:15,792
I was honest...

1358
01:11:16,805 --> 01:11:17,897
and I think he was too.

1359
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:21,876
It just wasn't what 
I wanted to hear.

1360
01:11:45,767 --> 01:11:46,969
Cheryl made the 
dressing I like so much

1361
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,937
and I did some of the 
cooking too, I even

1362
01:11:49,938 --> 01:11:51,940
I put the ice cubes
in the glasses

1363
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:53,840
and salt in the saltshakers.

1364
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:55,671
All right, well.

1365
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,773
Not long ago, I wouldn't
have been able to...

1366
01:12:00,883 --> 01:12:02,874
to put this group
of people together...

1367
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:04,782
in my wildest imagination.

1368
01:12:05,787 --> 01:12:07,778
The changes we've 
all been through

1369
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:10,817
the little hurts we've 
given each other

1370
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,785
we hope we're 
forgiven for them.

1371
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:16,797
We thank you, dear, lord

1372
01:12:17,699 --> 01:12:21,692
because there's nothing
more important than family.

1373
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:24,706
 - Amen.
 - Amen.

1374
01:12:24,873 --> 01:12:25,840
Amen.

1375
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:46,921
What the hell
do you want?

1376
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:49,890
You forgot your tampons?

1377
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:56,668
No, I didn't forget anything.

1378
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:00,705
I just came by to see you.

1379
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:01,876
What for?

1380
01:13:01,944 --> 01:13:04,780
You already destroyed
my, TV and family room.

1381
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:06,915
You want to bust up
my kitchen as well?

1382
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:08,850
Look, I'm sorry
about that, Dad.

1383
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:10,819
I didn't mean to do all of that, 
I was actuall just trying to...

1384
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:12,753
Where's tiny?
She didn't come?

1385
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:15,757
Oh, Kate uh...

1386
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:18,722
she's not with me.

1387
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:21,955
She finally smelled the 
pathetic on you, did she?

1388
01:13:22,698 --> 01:13:25,701
No. In fact, she said
she wanted to get

1389
01:13:25,701 --> 01:13:27,896
more serious with me.
She said that

1390
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:30,739
you know,
she loved me

1391
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:33,775
and she wanted to see herself
having a family with me

1392
01:13:33,775 --> 01:13:34,833
having kids with me.

1393
01:13:36,878 --> 01:13:39,711
Well congratulations. That's 
what you want to hear?

1394
01:13:40,782 --> 01:13:42,773
- I said no, Dad.
- You what?

1395
01:13:45,687 --> 01:13:47,746
Yeah, I told her I didn't 
want to get married.

1396
01:13:50,892 --> 01:13:54,655
- Are you shitting me?
- Uh-uh.

1397
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:57,823
I'll be damned.
I'll be damned.

1398
01:13:57,899 --> 01:13:59,662
That's my boy.

1399
01:14:00,969 --> 01:14:03,836
I always said you were
the smart one, Lando.

1400
01:14:04,906 --> 01:14:07,739
Your mind and spirit
are strong, like mine.

1401
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:10,812
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1402
01:14:10,812 --> 01:14:13,713
I tell ya. It's always the one
you fight with the most

1403
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:14,908
who is the most like you.

1404
01:14:17,886 --> 01:14:19,888
Well why are we 
standing out here for?

1405
01:14:19,888 --> 01:14:21,856
Let's go inside, have a 
drink. Just the two of us.

1406
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:23,825
Man to man.
Father to son.

1407
01:14:23,825 --> 01:14:25,927
- Alright. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1408
01:14:25,927 --> 01:14:27,690
You're a big boy now.

1409
01:14:28,697 --> 01:14:29,664
Let's go in.

1410
01:14:30,699 --> 01:14:32,758
Take appraisal of the 
damage you've done.

1411
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:41,777
Would anyone like
anything else?

1412
01:14:41,777 --> 01:14:44,803
- No, no.
- This one's out.

1413
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,750
Dad, can you check
on, Jackson?

1414
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:50,877
- Yeah. The blanket.
- He's got the pillow.

1415
01:14:50,952 --> 01:14:52,715
- This is hers?
- Yeah.

1416
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:10,865
Hey.

1417
01:16:15,837 --> 01:16:16,804
Okay, listen.

1418
01:16:16,972 --> 01:16:20,738
If you get one, you might as well 
get two 'cause they're like dogs.

1419
01:16:21,676 --> 01:16:23,712
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about, kids.

1420
01:16:23,712 --> 01:16:25,873
If you leave one by itself,
at home, you're never gonna leave.

1421
01:16:25,947 --> 01:16:28,750
'cause you're gonna feel so guilty about
leaving it there by itself.

1422
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,945
But if there's two, you don't feel
bad they got someone to play with.

1423
01:16:31,686 --> 01:16:32,921
The other big thing to 
think about is, school.

1424
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:35,791
Do you send them to private school?
Because then you got sweater vests 

1425
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:38,794
and lacrosse coming at you all day.
But if you go to a public school 

1426
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:40,887
you got to worry about some 
art student, who's hyperactive 

1427
01:16:40,962 --> 01:16:43,965
who's all hopped up on medication,
who might try to shank the little guy,

1428
01:16:43,965 --> 01:16:45,767
and that's uncomfortable too.

1429
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:48,937
Are you having this conversation with me, because 
you're comfortable having this conversation with me?

1430
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:51,807
Or are you just having this conversation, 
because you wanna go to, Fiji?

1431
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:52,865
I wanna go to, Fiji.

1432
01:16:52,974 --> 01:16:54,843
Because the tickets 
are already paid for

1433
01:16:54,843 --> 01:16:56,878
and the hotel rooms
aren't transferable.

1434
01:16:56,878 --> 01:17:00,749
But, honey, I do 
feel comfortable now

1435
01:17:00,749 --> 01:17:03,684
I think having this conversation
because in my heart 

1436
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:05,811
I know I've found
the one person in life 

1437
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:08,720
that I want to have
these conversations with.

1438
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:09,916
And that person's you.

1439
01:17:10,859 --> 01:17:12,793
- I love you so much.
- Come here.

1440
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:21,770
So it's like, this doesn't mean
we're getting married

1441
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:23,670
- or having kids right away.
- No, no, no.

1442
01:17:23,738 --> 01:17:25,941
But we should talk about it,
because these things do happen.

1443
01:17:25,941 --> 01:17:29,672
Not that we're planning on it. We're just talking 
about it, because these things happens.

1444
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:31,947
And if we do have them,
then, you know...

1445
01:17:31,947 --> 01:17:34,950
- there's a lot of advantages.
- Yeah. They wonderful, 

1446
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:36,852
I mean, they give 
you love, unconditionally.

1447
01:17:36,852 --> 01:17:38,945
Also, they're like little
walking tax shelters.

1448
01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:40,916
Because you can 
write a lot of stuff off.

1449
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:43,685
Yeah, and not to mention all the 
yard work. You save so much money.

1450
01:17:43,758 --> 01:17:46,728
I mean, once they become a certain age, 
we're not gonna have them on the lawnmower.

1451
01:17:46,728 --> 01:17:48,797
- When they're seven.
- I know what your talking about, not slave labor.

1452
01:17:48,797 --> 01:17:50,799
- No, no, no.
- We're talking about teaching them discipline.

1453
01:17:50,799 --> 01:17:53,735
- Chores for money.
- And we're not like even planning for like our future.

1454
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:56,805
We would've ended up living in some
home playing Bingo in, Florida.

1455
01:17:56,805 --> 01:17:57,931
But now we can 
live with them.

1456
01:17:58,707 --> 01:18:01,743
- They're gonna sell us out.
- This is exciting. We never thought about it like this.

1457
01:18:01,743 --> 01:18:03,712
Honey, I want you to feel 
comfortable to talk to me

1458
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:05,805
about anything you 
want to talk about.

1459
01:18:06,781 --> 01:18:09,750
Unless there's like, you know a 
play-off's game or something like that.

1460
01:18:09,851 --> 01:18:11,819
You know what I mean? We 
can find an appropriate time.

1461
01:18:11,887 --> 01:18:14,720
- I'm kidding. Kind of.
- Okay, babe.

1462
01:18:14,789 --> 01:18:16,780
Listen, just to be clear,
this doesn't mean

1463
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:18,727
that we're getting 
married right away 

1464
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:20,786
or having kids right away.
just means that we're open

1465
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:22,887
to let love grow
where it wants to grow.

1466
01:18:22,964 --> 01:18:25,694
- Exactly.
- We're open to letting it grow.

1467
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:26,756
But, it doesn't mean kids.

1468
01:18:29,704 --> 01:18:32,696
- Wow, I can't believe we did it.
- We did.

1469
01:18:33,942 --> 01:18:36,811
I don't even know what happened,
I can't even remember the procedure

1470
01:18:36,811 --> 01:18:39,714
but here's this beautiful
thing here. You know what I mean?

1471
01:18:39,714 --> 01:18:41,850
I did feel
like an air traffic controller.

1472
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:44,785
Between the huffs,
and the signals and stuff

1473
01:18:44,853 --> 01:18:46,718
it just kind of all 
happened. But, god.

1474
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:49,680
It's awesome, baby.
You're so awesome.

1475
01:18:49,758 --> 01:18:51,726
You were amazing.
You were like this.

1476
01:18:51,793 --> 01:18:53,862
- Thanks, babe.
- We have a baby!

1477
01:18:53,862 --> 01:18:56,698
- How's she doing?
- Good. She's sleeping.

1478
01:18:56,698 --> 01:18:59,734
Just wanted to let you and
our little new year's baby know 

1479
01:18:59,734 --> 01:19:01,929
that you're welcome to start 
bringing in family members now.

1480
01:19:02,704 --> 01:19:04,695
- Oh that's not gonna happen.
- No, no family.

1481
01:19:05,807 --> 01:19:06,933
Your families don't 
know you had a baby?

1482
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:10,745
To be honest, I think they'd be shocked
to even hear that, Kate was even pregnant.

1483
01:19:10,745 --> 01:19:12,747
Our families can be 
a little much sometimes.

1484
01:19:12,747 --> 01:19:15,716
I like to think that we're
keeping it special for us 

1485
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:17,819
rather than not
including them.

1486
01:19:17,819 --> 01:19:18,945
Happy New Year, Bay Area!

1487
01:19:19,688 --> 01:19:21,723
We are here live
at Pacific General

1488
01:19:21,723 --> 01:19:23,825
where the first baby of the 
new year, has just been born!

1489
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:26,658
Let's go say hello
to those lucky parents!

1490
01:19:26,828 --> 01:19:28,797
Congratulations, McVie family

1491
01:19:28,797 --> 01:19:30,899
on having the first baby
of the, new year!

1492
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:32,662
Dad, how does it feel?

1493
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:39,668
We're doing great.

1494
01:19:39,874 --> 01:19:43,833
And there was a... a vacuum.

01:19:45,747 --> 01:19:47,139
And then there was, umm...

1496
01:19:47,882 --> 01:19:50,752
stretching and the juices.

1497
01:19:50,752 --> 01:19:53,855
What he's trying to say is that
we're just beyond words, excited.

1498
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,880
Oh, oh goodness.

1499
01:19:59,694 --> 01:20:00,786
I got some in my mouth!

1500
01:20:01,763 --> 01:20:03,856
I can't be around it!
I'm gonna do it too!
