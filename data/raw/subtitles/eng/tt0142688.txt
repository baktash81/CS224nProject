1
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:41,048
It's an impressive collection.
You have some very rare editions here.

2
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:45,344
- Are you sure you wanna sell them all?
- They're no use to Father, not anymore.

3
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,722
Not since he's been this way.

4
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:52,101
His library was his whole world.
Now it's just a painful memory.

5
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,562
Unbearably painful.

6
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,732
I understand.

7
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:06,323
Well, at a rough preliminary estimate,
you have a collection here...

8
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,325
...worth around $600,000.

9
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,910
Six hundred thousand?

10
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,413
Yes, or thereabouts.

11
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:16,542
I've picked out one or two volumes
that merit special attention.

12
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,587
This Persiles, for example, is important.

13
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:20,963
I'd hang on to that.

14
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,507
It will never depreciate.
It's a good investment.

15
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,719
- Valuable?
- Very valuable.

16
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:33,601
As for this Hypnerotomachia Di Poliphili
by Colonna, Venice 1545...

17
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,729
...I'm sure I could find you a buyer.

18
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:40,191
But I wouldn't let the rest go
for less than $500,000...

19
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,777
...under any circumstances.

20
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,112
It may take a month to place them.

21
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,281
In the meantime,
I advise you to be patient.

22
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,241
- A month?
- Yes, a month or two.

23
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,494
It depends on how much
of a hurry you're in.

24
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,204
You see, more hurry, less money.

25
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:57,041
- Of course.
- Well, that's my advice anyway.

26
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,251
I'm sure you wouldn't
want to rush things...

27
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,796
...but please feel free
to consult another expert.

28
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,465
If you have any questions,
you know where to reach me.

29
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:09,970
Incidentally, this four-volume edition
of Don Quixote is quite nice...

30
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,972
...but not particularly valuable.

31
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:17,353
Now, I could take it off your hands...

32
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,897
...right away.

33
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,945
How much were you thinking of?

34
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,824
I couldn't go more
than 4000, 4200, tops.

35
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,284
Fine.

36
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,460
- You here?
- Hello, Witkin.

37
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:42,878
You didn't waste much time.

38
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,297
There's a small fortune in there,
help yourself.

39
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,550
You're a vulture, Corso. A vulture.

40
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,301
Who isn't, in our business?

41
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,678
You'd stoop to anything.

42
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,680
For a Quixote by Ybarra?
You bet I would.

43
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:56,058
Unscrupulous.
Thoroughly unscrupulous.

44
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,102
Happy hunting.

45
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,957
I just got off the phone with Witkin.

46
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,876
He's spitting blood.

47
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,045
Really? What's his problem?

48
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,884
He said you're a double-dealing,
money-grubbing bastard.

49
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,262
Thought he had that deal sewed up.

50
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,264
He said you queered his pitch.

51
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,933
Well, he should've been
quicker off the mark.

52
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,560
May I?

53
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:44,023
Sure. And he said your evaluation
was way over the top.

54
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,859
Got those people coming out in a rash.

55
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:50,487
Now they're asking twice
what those books are worth.

56
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,287
Let's face it, you screwed him.

57
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,331
- That's what it's called.
- Yes.

58
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,750
He also said
that you snatched the Don Qui...

59
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:14,386
Ybarra, Don Quixote, 1780.

60
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,264
All four volumes.

61
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,266
Son of a bitch.

62
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,268
Fantastic.

63
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,188
Fantastic. You are the best.

64
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:28,192
That client of yours, the Swiss,
you think he'd still be interested in this?

65
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,487
I have Witkin on my ass. I told him
I had no part of this operation.

66
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,364
Except 10 percent.

67
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,992
20 percent. The Swiss was my client.

68
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,120
- No deal.
- Fifteen, for my children's sake.

69
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,082
- You don't have any children.
- I'm still young, give me time.

70
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:45,918
Ten.

71
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:02,977
Hey, man, how you doing?
How about a couple of bucks?

72
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:06,105
Not today. Not today.

73
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,735
Hey.

74
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:30,462
And earlier, in 1580,
in De La Demonomanie Des Sorciers...

75
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,840
...by the Frenchman, Jean Bodin.

76
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:37,636
Bodin was probably the first
to attempt to establish a system...

77
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:41,890
...if the term 'system' may be applied
to the Middle Ages...

78
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,311
...for classifying
the contemporary perceptions of evil.

79
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:50,024
In Bodin, we find one of the first definitions
of the word 'witch.'

80
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,026
And I quote:

81
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:56,655
"A witch is a person who,
though cognizant of the laws of God...

82
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:01,160
...endeavors to act through
the medium of a pact with the devil."

83
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:04,705
To assist them in their work,
many witches kept familiars.

84
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,708
That is to say,
creatures such as cats or toads...

85
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:12,546
...in which supernatural spirits or demons
were thought to reside.

86
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,924
For those of you ladies and gentlemen
who wish to delve more deeply...

87
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,385
...into the controversial subject
of witchcraft...

88
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:22,598
...a great deal of relevant information
may be found in the following works:

89
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:25,726
Nicolas Remes' Demonolattia Libri...

90
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:31,065
...and Compendium Maleficarum
by Francesco Maria Guazzo.

91
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,286
I see you were stimulated
by my little talk, Mr. Corso.

92
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,625
- Did I snore?
- Well, it's nice of you to ask.

93
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:52,795
No. Not that I noticed.

94
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,004
Shall we go?

95
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,723
Don't you sleep nights?

96
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,601
- Like a baby.
- Strange.

97
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,812
I'd have bet a brace
of Gutenberg Bibles...

98
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,731
...you spend half the night
with your eyes peeled.

99
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,567
You're one of those lean,
hungry, restless types...

100
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,028
...that put the wind up Julius Caesar.

101
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:21,490
Men who stab their friends in the back.

102
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:27,955
Not, I suspect, that you have many friends,
do you, Mr. Corso?

103
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,124
Your kind seldom does.

104
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,626
That makes woo of us.

105
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,009
You're right, of course.

106
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,887
Your friendships don't concern me
in the least.

107
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:47,766
Our relations have always been strictly
commercial and that's the way I like it.

108
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,811
The professional and the personal
should be mutually exclusive.

109
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:54,481
Listen, I came here to do some business,
not shoot the breeze.

110
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,984
If you wanna expound
your personal philosophies...

111
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:58,277
...write another book.

112
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,946
- You don't like me, do you?
- I don't have to like you.

113
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,240
You're a client and you pay well.

114
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,090
You're privileged, Mr. Corso.

115
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,509
Very few people ever set foot in here.

116
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:25,429
This is my private collection.

117
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:29,349
Some bibliophiles specialize
in gothic novels...

118
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,685
...others in books of hours.

119
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:35,355
All my own rare editions
have the same protagonist.

120
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,523
The devil.

121
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,775
- May I take a look?
- Yes.

122
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,153
It's why I brought you here.

123
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,962
Beautiful, aren't they?

124
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:03,300
The soft sheen, the superb gilding.

125
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:06,345
Not to mention the centuries of wisdom
they contain.

126
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,806
I know people who would kill
for a collection like this.

127
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,518
The Ars Diavoli.

128
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:17,022
You'll never see as many books
on the subject anywhere else in the world.

129
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,067
They're the rarest,
the choicest editions in existence.

130
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:23,195
It's taken me a lifetime
to assemble them.

131
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,657
Only the supreme masterpiece
was missing.

132
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,325
Come.

133
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:39,044
The Nine Gates
of the Kingdom of Shadows.

134
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,004
- You're familiar with it?
- Yes.

135
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,298
Venice, 1666.

136
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:47,761
The author and printer, Aristide Torchia,
was burned by the holy lnquisition...

137
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,055
...together with all his works.

138
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,224
Only three copies survived.

139
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,392
One.

140
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,270
Catalog lists three copies surviving
in private ownership:

141
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,022
- Fargas, the Kessler and the Telfer.
- It's true.

142
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,025
You know your business,
but you're mistaken nonetheless.

143
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:05,112
According to my own research,
only one is authentic.

144
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,489
Well, three are known.

145
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,533
That's the trouble.

146
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,285
Where'd you get it?

147
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,620
I bought it from Telfer.

148
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:16,290
- Telfer?
- Yes, he finally sold it to me.

149
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,001
The day before he killed himself.

150
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,587
It's good timing.

151
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,143
- Silence is golden.
- Precisely.

152
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,937
Ever heard of the Delomelanicon?

153
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,232
I've heard of it, yes. It's a myth, isn't it?

154
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,818
A book reputed to have been written
by Satan himself.

155
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,111
No myth.

156
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,779
That book existed.

157
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,574
Torchia actually acquired it.

158
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,871
The engravings you are now admiring
were adapted...

159
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,041
...by Torchia from the Delomelanicon.

160
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,586
They form a kind of satanic riddle.

161
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:05,422
Correctly interpreted
with the aid of the original text...

162
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,424
...and sufficient inside information...

163
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:11,928
...they're reputed to conjure up
the prince of darkness in person.

164
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,139
You don't say.

165
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,017
Are you a religious man, Mr. Corso?

166
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:20,228
I mean, do you believe
in the supernatural?

167
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,440
I believe in my percentage.

168
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,569
Don't you get dizzy standing there?

169
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:33,909
What is it that you want
from me, Balkan?

170
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,000
I want you to go to Europe
and investigate.

171
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,586
The other two copies are
in Portugal and France.

172
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,673
I want you to find some way
of comparing them with mine.

173
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,967
Every page, every engraving,
the binding, everything.

174
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,887
I'm convinced only one is authentic.
I wanna know which.

175
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,555
That could be an expensive trip.

176
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,476
That's to get you started.

177
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,645
Spend what you need.

178
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,357
What if I find that your copy's a forgery?

179
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,401
It's quite possible.

180
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,111
Really?

181
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,656
It doesn't appear to be.

182
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,662
- Even the paper sounds kosher.
- Even so.

183
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:22,082
- There's something wrong.
- You mean the devil won't show up?

184
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,547
If all three copies turn out to be bogus
or incomplete, your work will be done.

185
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,508
If, on the other hand,
one of them turns out to be genuine...

186
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,093
...I'll finance you further.

187
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:37,889
I want you to get it for me,
at all costs, never mind how.

188
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,976
- "Never mind how" sounds illegal.
- Wouldn't be the first time...

189
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,769
...you've done something illegal.

190
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:46,606
- Not that illegal.
- Hence the size of the check.

191
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,322
Do a good job, I'll double it.

192
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,495
Gotta be something wrong with it
if you're letting it out of your hands.

193
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,622
I have the utmost faith in you,
Mr. Corso.

194
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,460
Nothing more reliable than a man whose
loyalty can be bought for hard cash.

195
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:09,022
Good morning, I'm Dean Corso.

196
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:13,401
I'm terribly sorry to disturb you
at a time like this.

197
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:27,999
It would be very helpful, ma'am,
if you could tell me what you know...

198
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,210
...about this book.

199
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:41,930
- Isn't this one of my husband's books?
- Right.

200
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:46,059
It was in his collection until very recently.
He sold it to a client of mine.

201
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:47,644
I'm trying to authenticate it.

202
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,771
He sold it, you say?

203
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,566
Strange. This was one of
his most treasured possessions.

204
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,609
- He never mentioned the sale?
- No.

205
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,736
It's news to me.

206
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,363
Who bought it?

207
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,657
A private collector.

208
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,200
May I know his name?

209
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,161
I'm afraid that's confidential.

210
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,414
I suppose he has a bill of sale?

211
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:09,791
- No problem there.
- Is this your job?

212
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,877
Authenticating rare books?

213
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,546
And tracking them down, yes.

214
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,047
You're a book detective.

215
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,924
Kind of.

216
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:22,220
Do you recall when and where
your husband acquired this book?

217
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,224
In Spain.

218
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,768
We were vacationing at Toledo.

219
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,146
Andrew got very excited.

220
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:33,940
He paid a great deal of money for it.

221
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,610
He was a fanatical collector.

222
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,737
So I gather.

223
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:41,239
I'll show you.

224
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,637
It's impressive.

225
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:07,349
Andrew used to spend many hours
in here.

226
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,559
Too many.

227
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,478
Did he ever try it out?

228
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,147
I don't understand.

229
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:15,649
The book.

230
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,234
Did he ever use it to perform
some kind of ritual...

231
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,488
...intended to produce
a supernatural effect?

232
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:23,073
Are you serious?

233
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,241
Yes, absolutely.

234
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,828
Andrew was a trifle eccentric,
Mr. Corso...

235
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,997
...but he wasn't insane.

236
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:33,458
It's true he'd been acting...

237
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,963
...strangely those last few days.
He shut himself up in here.

238
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,841
He seldom emerged except for meals.

239
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,678
That morning, I was awoken...

240
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,347
...by the screams of the maid.

241
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,852
He'd hanged himself.

242
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:57,440
Whatever he was up to...

243
00:21:57,608 --> 00:22:02,362
...I certainly can't see him chanting
mumbo jumbo or trying to raise the dead.

244
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,407
The devil, Mrs. Telfer.

245
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,492
This book is designed to raise the devil.

246
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:07,093
Thus let the light shine.

247
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:06,606
Son of a bitch. Where did you get this?

248
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:08,107
Balkan.

249
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,485
Wants me to research it.

250
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,987
Balkan owns a Nine Gates?

251
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:16,282
Recently acquired
from the late lamented Andrew Telfer.

252
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,825
Trust Balkan.

253
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:21,371
What does he need you for?
I don't suppose he plans to sell it.

254
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:24,249
He wants me to compare it
with the two surviving copies...

255
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,292
...which are in Portugal and France.

256
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,213
- So I'm off to Europe.
- Compare it?

257
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:34,133
Yeah. Only one of three's authentic,
he says.

258
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,136
Well, this looks genuine enough.

259
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,931
Christ, it's gotta be worth a million.

260
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:43,226
- Take care of it.
- That's why I'm here.

261
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:44,811
I need you to stash it for me.

262
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:48,022
- Because I'm starting to see things.
- Like what?

263
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,317
Uninvited visitors, unfamiliar faces.

264
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:54,487
I don't trust anyone, not even Balkan.

265
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:57,115
Come to think of it,
I'm not even sure I trust you.

266
00:26:57,283 --> 00:27:00,285
You know I wouldn't screw you
unless there was a good reason.

267
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:04,622
Money, women, business.
Other than that, you can relax.

268
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:08,293
- I'll pick it up on my way to the airport.
- Sure.

269
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,837
These engravings are terrific.

270
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,048
Or horrific, whichever.

271
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:18,219
Sensational. Absolutely sensational.

272
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,181
May I come in?

273
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:14,567
Please, sit down.

274
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,239
I've come to talk business.

275
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:25,912
Yesterday, when you came to see me
about that book...

276
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:30,166
...I was too surprised to react
as I should've done.

277
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,835
I mean, it really was one
of Andrew's favorites.

278
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:34,962
So you said.

279
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,256
I'd like to get it back.

280
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:41,761
- That could be a problem.
- Not necessarily. It all depends.

281
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:44,764
- On what?
- On you.

282
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:48,935
I don't understand, Mrs. Telfer.
The book is not mine to dispose of.

283
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,237
You work for money, I take it?

284
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,447
- What else?
- I have a great deal of money.

285
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:04,367
- I'm very happy for you.
- You could stage a theft.

286
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:07,245
I imagine your client is well insured.

287
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,956
- I'm a professional, ma'am.
- A professional mercenary.

288
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:14,127
- Mercenaries work for the highest bidder.
- I make a living.

289
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:15,962
I could throw in a bonus.

290
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:21,217
- This has happened before someplace.
- I know. In the movies.

291
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:24,053
And she had an automatic
in her stocking.

292
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:29,684
No automatic.

293
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:41,821
- Would you like a drink?
- Why not?

294
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,665
Okay, where is it?

295
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,375
Where's what?

296
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,378
Don't fuck with me.

297
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,923
I thought I already did.

298
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,762
Wait. No, no, wait, wait, wait.

299
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:31,931
Take it easy. Wait.

300
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:56,789
You have reached
Bernie's Rare Books.

301
00:31:56,957 --> 00:32:00,126
Please leave your message
after the beep.

302
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,796
Bernie, you there?

303
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,382
Pick up.

304
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,053
Bernie.

305
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:37,330
Give me a minute, I won't be long.

306
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:41,125
- You can take me on to Kennedy.
- No problem, sir.

307
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,612
Bernie?

308
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:14,367
Bernie.

309
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,953
Oh, Jesus.

310
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,055
Jesus Christ.

311
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,315
Bernie.

312
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,951
No problem?

313
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:16,489
Stop.

314
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:20,367
- Stop at that phone booth. Pull over.
- No problem, sir.

315
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,918
He isn't available at this time.
May I know who's calling?

316
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,337
- Dean Corso.
- Would you like to leave a message?

317
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:33,964
No. I have to talk with him at once.

318
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,591
Oh, I'm afraid he's in transit.

319
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:38,803
Give me your number, I'll have him return
when he checks with us.

320
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,846
No. I am at a phone booth.

321
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,556
It's an emergency.

322
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,600
I have to speak with him right now.

323
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,812
Right now, do you hear me? Right now.

324
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:50,564
One moment.

325
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,375
- Jesus Christ.
- Are you there, Mr. Corso?

326
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:12,086
- Yes.
- I'll patch you through.

327
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:17,633
Mr. Corso, what have you got for me?

328
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:20,553
- More than I bargained for.
- What do you mean?

329
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,390
I mean I quit. I wanna return the book.
Where are you?

330
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:26,934
I'm disappointed in you, Mr. Corso.

331
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:29,019
You never let me down before.

332
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,355
Well, this is different.

333
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:34,108
- You remember Bernie Ornstein?
- Ornstein?

334
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:35,734
- Yeah.
- The dealer?

335
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:40,281
I gave him your book to stash for me,
and now he's dead. Murdered.

336
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,907
Because of the book?

337
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:43,909
What else?

338
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:48,163
Well, I never said it would be easy.
If it's a question of money...

339
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,874
It isn't the money. I want out.

340
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,418
This matter means a great deal to me,
Mr. Corso.

341
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:54,753
I'm not an ungenerous man,
you know that.

342
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:58,924
Proceed as arranged and you can
tack another zero onto your fee.

343
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:01,302
Final call for passengers
traveling to Paris...

344
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:05,222
Hey, where are you, Balkan?

345
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,559
Balkan?

346
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,157
- Do you speak English?
- Yes, I do.

347
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:08,702
I would like to get your opinion on this.

348
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:22,675
What a habit for a bookbinder.

349
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,427
The Nine Gates, superb edition.

350
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:28,597
Very rare. The Telfer copy.

351
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,558
Yes. You used to own it, right?

352
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,935
- We used to, yes.
- Sold it.

353
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:35,521
We sold it when the opportunity
presented itself.

354
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:37,856
- It was too good to...
- Too good to miss.

355
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:40,317
- An excellent sale.
- An excellent buy.

356
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:43,278
- Impeccable condition.
- Impeccable.

357
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:46,532
- Are you the present owner?
- No. A client of mine.

358
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:50,327
I would never have believed
she would part with it, never.

359
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,538
- She?
- Mrs. Telfer.

360
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:58,377
I understood that it was
Mr. Telfer that had bought it.

361
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:00,045
He paid for it.

362
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:02,214
It was Mrs. Telfer who made him buy it.

363
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:05,217
- He didn't seem particularly...
- Interested.

364
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,554
An exceptional specimen.

365
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:11,140
- Do you think it could be a forgery?
- Forgery?

366
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:14,226
- You hear that, Pablo?
- I took you for a professional.

367
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:17,563
- You speak too lightly of forgeries.
- Far too lightly.

368
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:20,649
Forging a book is very expensive.

369
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:25,070
Paper of the period, right inks.
Too expensive to be profitable.

370
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:27,031
- Still, it can be done.
- Of course.

371
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,075
Requires a great skill,
but, yes, it can be done.

372
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:32,244
Do you think
that could be the case here?

373
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:33,412
What makes you ask?

374
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:37,583
My client wishes to satisfy himself
on the book's authenticity.

375
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:40,753
His name is Balkan.
Boris Balkan of New York.

376
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,840
- All books have a destiny of their own.
- And a life of their own.

377
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:48,969
Mr. Balkan is a celebrated collector.
He's no fool.

378
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,929
He must know this book
is authentic.

379
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,681
- We know it.
- So must he.

380
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:55,059
- We had this book for years.
- Many years.

381
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,770
And ample opportunity
to study it thoroughly.

382
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:01,065
The printing, the binding
are magnificent examples...

383
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,192
...of 17th century
Venetian craftsmanship.

384
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,863
Finest rag paper,
resistant to the passage of time.

385
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:10,324
None of your modern wood pulp.

386
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:14,411
Watermarks, ink, typefaces.

387
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:18,123
If this is a forgery,
or a copy with missing pages restored...

388
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:19,792
...it's the work of a master.

389
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,794
- A master.
- Yes.

390
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,129
Have you studied the engravings?

391
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,965
They seem to have
some underlying significance.

392
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,885
But of course. Here, for example.

393
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:32,304
This one could be interpreted
as a warning.

394
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:37,726
"Venture too far," it seems to say, "and
danger will descend on you from above."

395
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:40,729
These type of books
often contain little puzzles.

396
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:44,274
Especially in the case
of such an illustrious collaborator.

397
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,442
Collaborator?

398
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,987
You could not have proceeded
very far in your research, señor.

399
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,656
Here, look close.

400
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:53,325
Now, you see?
Only six of the nine engravings...

401
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,244
...were signed by Aristide Torchia.

402
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:58,455
Yes. And the other three?

403
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:00,582
This is one of them.

404
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,836
"LCF."

405
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:07,256
- Who's LCF?
- Think.

406
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,305
Lucifer?

407
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:19,560
Very perceptive of you, señor.

408
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,855
Torchia was burned alive
because he wrote this book...

409
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,815
...in collaboration with someone else.

410
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,733
Come on. You can't honestly believe...

411
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:30,612
The man who wrote this book
did so in alliance with the devil...

412
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,239
...and went to the stake for it.

413
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:35,868
Even hell has its heroes, señor.

414
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,817
I've seen you before.

415
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:34,528
- Have you?
- Yes.

416
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:36,989
Are you traveling in this car?

417
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,658
- The next one.
- The sleeper.

418
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:42,244
I travel on the cheap.

419
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:44,705
You're a student?

420
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,082
Something like that.

421
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:51,003
- I like trains.
- Trains I'm on?

422
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,171
Just trains.

423
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:57,175
What's your name?

424
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,011
Guess.

425
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,723
- Green eyes...
- That'll do.

426
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,350
- What's yours?
- Corso.

427
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:07,436
Strange name.

428
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,980
Italian. It means "run."

429
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:12,274
You don't look like a runner to me.

430
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:13,942
More the quiet type.

431
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:21,950
Well, give my regards to Balkan.

432
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:25,329
- Tell him I'm doing my best.
- Balkan?

433
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,497
Never mind.

434
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,666
See you around.

435
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,668
Maybe.

436
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:35,088
I wouldn't be surprised.

437
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:17,149
Yes, Dean Corso, Mr. Fargas.

438
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:21,570
Corso? Oh, yes. Please, come in.

439
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,405
Thank you.

440
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:30,036
Please.

441
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,002
Home, sweet home.

442
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:43,216
You won't say no to a brandy, I take it?

443
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:45,552
Thank you very much.

444
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,609
Thank you.

445
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:03,862
What handsome glasses.

446
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,448
They're the only ones I have left.

447
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,533
Thanks.

448
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:13,371
- Must've been a beautiful place.
- It was.

449
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:16,583
But old families
are like ancient civilizations...

450
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:19,002
...they wither and die.

451
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:25,675
There they are, 834 our of them.

452
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,595
A pity you didn't see them
in better times.

453
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:29,971
I used to have 5000.

454
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:33,016
But these are the survivors.

455
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:35,393
So this is the Fargas collection?

456
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:38,396
Not quite as I imagined it, I must say.

457
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,065
C'est la vie, my friend.

458
00:47:40,233 --> 00:47:45,153
But I keep them in perfect condition.
Safe from damp, light, heat, rats.

459
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:47,239
I dust and air them every day.

460
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:54,746
These are the occult.

461
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:56,581
What do you think?

462
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:58,875
- Not bad.
- Not bad indeed.

463
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:01,545
At least 10 of them are extremely rare.
Here.

464
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,589
Plancy's Dictionnaire Infernal.

465
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:08,843
First edition, 1844.

466
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:16,685
Leonardo Fioravanti's
Compendio de Secreti, 1571.

467
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,650
And there it is.

468
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,027
In perfect condition.

469
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:32,659
It has traveled the
world for three and a half centuries...

470
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:35,370
...yet it might've been printed yesterday.

471
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:39,374
Is it in order? I mean, you haven't
detected anything unusual?

472
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:42,961
Unusual? No.
The text is complete, the engravings too.

473
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:45,964
Nine, plus the title page,
just as the catalog states...

474
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:50,135
...just like Kessler in Paris
and Telfer in New York.

475
00:48:50,303 --> 00:48:53,138
Yes. It isn't the Telfer anymore.

476
00:48:53,306 --> 00:48:54,973
Telfer killed himself.

477
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:58,560
But he sold his copy
to Boris Balkan first.

478
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:00,645
Balkan.

479
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:03,732
If he sets his heart on a book,
no price is too high.

480
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:06,151
Not that I would ever sell this one.

481
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,944
Not at any price.

482
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,281
It's...

483
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:13,783
It's strange that he
should've sent you here...

484
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,536
...if he already had...

485
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,956
You have it here?

486
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:22,709
May I see it?

487
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,521
Superb.

488
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:50,028
Beautiful.

489
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:51,696
Identical.

490
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:54,366
Two of the only three
to escape the flames...

491
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:57,952
...reunited for the first time
in over three centuries.

492
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,872
Yes.

493
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,208
Look at this slight imperfection here.

494
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:05,210
The damaged S.

495
00:50:05,378 --> 00:50:08,296
The same type, the same impression.

496
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:10,882
Incredible.

497
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:15,720
You see,
if it weren't for this slight discoloration...

498
00:50:15,888 --> 00:50:19,391
...on the back of your copy,
no one could tell them apart.

499
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:24,229
If you don't mind, I'd like to stay for a while
and examine them in detail.

500
00:50:27,316 --> 00:50:30,068
What are you looking for, Mr. Corso?

501
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:32,237
I'm not quite sure.

502
00:50:32,405 --> 00:50:36,574
Some books are dangerous.
Not to be opened with impunity.

503
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,159
That's very true.

504
00:51:13,446 --> 00:51:15,780
I'll be damned.

505
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:18,379
Hello again.

506
00:54:19,048 --> 00:54:21,799
- You didn't say you were bound for Sintra.
- Neither did you.

507
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:24,886
- What are you doing here?
- Reading.

508
00:54:25,054 --> 00:54:27,889
- I can see that.
- And bumping into people.

509
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:29,557
Unexpectedly.

510
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:32,143
Yes. Unexpectedly is right.

511
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:35,438
Are you on a business trip?

512
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:38,483
Is that why you always carry
that thing around?

513
00:54:44,073 --> 00:54:46,658
- Is this part of your course?
- My course?

514
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:49,494
Winning friends and influencing people.

515
00:54:49,662 --> 00:54:52,246
- You said you were a student.
- Did I?

516
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:55,625
So I am. In a way.

517
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:58,336
I like books.

518
00:54:58,504 --> 00:55:00,129
Do you?

519
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:06,219
- Have you been traveling long?
- A while.

520
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:09,097
I don't suppose you
ever travel by motorbike.

521
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:11,599
Excuse me, señor.

522
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:13,518
For me? You're sure?

523
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,110
The phone, sir.

524
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,362
- Yes?
- Mr. Corso?

525
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,823
My God. How'd you find me?

526
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:28,491
Made any progress?

527
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:31,369
Progress? Yeah, you could call it that.

528
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:33,204
Well?

529
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:36,749
I can't talk here, I'm in the lobby.
Let me call you back. Where are you?

530
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:40,086
Never mind that. Get them
to transfer it to your room, I'll wait.

531
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:41,713
All right.

532
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:45,550
Señor, pardon me. Could you
send this up to my room, please?

533
00:55:45,718 --> 00:55:46,801
- Yes.
- Thank you.

534
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:58,646
- Still there?
- Yes.

535
00:55:58,814 --> 00:55:59,814
All right.

536
00:55:59,982 --> 00:56:01,774
I've examined the Fargas copy.

537
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:04,235
It's authentic enough,
at least it looks that way.

538
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:07,488
It's like yours,
but there are discrepancies.

539
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:09,574
Discrepancies?

540
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:13,244
The engravings, they're not identical.

541
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:15,455
It's, like, keys in different hands...

542
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:18,666
...doorways open in one copy
and bricked up in the other.

543
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:20,793
- And there's another thing.
- Yes.

544
00:56:20,961 --> 00:56:22,879
Yes, go on.

545
00:56:23,047 --> 00:56:28,301
Ones that differ aren't signed "Torchia."
They're signed "LCF."

546
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:32,221
- Still there?
- LCF?

547
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:33,931
Listen, where are you, anyway?

548
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,851
I must have that copy, Mr. Corso.

549
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:38,936
Get it for me.

550
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:43,107
The old man wouldn't sell it
to save his life. He said as much.

551
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:44,942
Did he?

552
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:50,114
Hello?

553
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:23,064
Just a minute.

554
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,323
Yeah.

555
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:44,877
- What time is it?
- Early, but you have to go.

556
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,839
- Go? Go where?
- The Fargas place.

557
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,298
I've already seen Fargas.

558
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,259
I think you should see him again.

559
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:54,011
What is this, some kind of practical joke?
Who are you?

560
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:57,682
- What do you know about Fargas?
- Get dressed. I'll wait for you outside.

561
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:44,103
Don't bother. He isn't there.

562
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:46,355
Oh, really? Then where is he?

563
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,232
Over there.

564
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:19,597
God almighty.

565
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:34,028
Wanna get inside?

566
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:37,114
I had thought about it, yes.

567
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:01,889
You wait here.

568
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:28,666
Shit.

569
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:52,690
Well? Did you find it?

570
01:00:52,858 --> 01:00:56,193
You know, it's come to my attention
that you know too goddamn much.

571
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:59,864
- Why do you keep following me around?
- You're wasting time asking questions.

572
01:01:00,032 --> 01:01:03,242
Better get out of here. There's
a flight from Lisbon to Paris at noon.

573
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:05,536
- We should just make it.
- What's with the "we"?

574
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:07,330
There are two of us, aren't there?

575
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,790
What happened back there?

576
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:18,841
The old man caught someone stealing,
I guess.

577
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:22,470
- What do you guess happened to him?
- He drowned.

578
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:25,598
- With a little help from who?
- He's dead. Who cares?

579
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:27,433
I do.

580
01:01:27,768 --> 01:01:30,269
I could easily wind up the same way.

581
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:33,356
Not with me around to look after you.

582
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:35,608
Oh, I see.
You're my guardian angel then.

583
01:01:35,776 --> 01:01:37,860
If you say so.

584
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:46,577
- Someone's playing a game with me.
- Of course. You're a part of it.

585
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:50,289
And you're getting to like it.

586
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:39,422
- Hello, Gruber.
- Hello, Mr. Corso.

587
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,340
Delighted to see you again.

588
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:44,718
We don't have any vacancies...

589
01:02:45,053 --> 01:02:48,347
...but I'm sure I'll be able
to organize something.

590
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:52,309
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

591
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:22,233
Good afternoon.

592
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:26,111
I'm Dean Corso. I have an appointment
with Baroness Kessler.

593
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,451
This way.

594
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:43,837
You have 30 minutes.

595
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:51,512
- Yes?
- Monsieur Corso.

596
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,974
Oh, yes, Mr. Corso. Come in.

597
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:58,227
I've heard a great deal about you.

598
01:04:58,937 --> 01:05:02,356
- Nothing good, I hope.
- You hope right.

599
01:05:03,191 --> 01:05:05,943
Well, I'm reassured, baroness,
because in my trade...

600
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:10,864
...to be spoken well of
can be professionally disastrous.

601
01:05:12,117 --> 01:05:15,244
- My God.
- Yes, there it is.

602
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:17,746
The Kessler collection.

603
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:21,500
I know your catalog almost by heart.

604
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:23,377
Strange we haven't met before.

605
01:05:23,545 --> 01:05:26,130
Your name is a byword
among dealers and collectors.

606
01:05:26,715 --> 01:05:30,759
But I imagine you know
your own reputation better than I do.

607
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:33,929
Yes, well, it does keep the wolf
from the door, so to speak.

608
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:36,056
Sorry, were you
in the middle of something?

609
01:05:36,224 --> 01:05:40,644
My latest work, The Devil: History
and Myth, a kind of biography.

610
01:05:41,229 --> 01:05:43,981
It will be published early next year.

611
01:05:44,149 --> 01:05:46,317
- Why the devil?
- I saw him one day.

612
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:50,404
I was 15 years old
and I saw him as plain as I see you now.

613
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:52,239
It was love at first sight.

614
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:55,492
You know, 300 years ago,
you'd have been burned at the stake...

615
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:59,455
- ...for saying something like that.
- I wouldn't have said it.

616
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:03,125
Nor would I have made
a million by writing about it.

617
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:04,835
Yeah.

618
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:08,255
What is it you wish to discuss,
Mr. Corso?

619
01:06:08,423 --> 01:06:11,508
There's a book in your collection
I'd like to examine, if possible.

620
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:13,594
The Nine Gates
of the Kingdom of Shadows?

621
01:06:13,762 --> 01:06:16,805
The Nine Gates. An interesting work.

622
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:19,224
Everyone's been asking me
about it lately.

623
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:21,852
- Is that so?
- Follow me.

624
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:27,733
Do you truly believe
in the devil, baroness?

625
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:31,779
Enough to devote my life
and my library to him.

626
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:35,366
Not to mention many years of work.

627
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:36,700
Don't you?

628
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:38,702
Almost.

629
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:42,706
This book demands
a certain amount of faith.

630
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:45,125
I'm afraid my faith
is in short supply these days.

631
01:06:45,293 --> 01:06:50,005
I know this work extremely well.
I've studied it for years.

632
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:52,800
Do you have any doubts
about its authenticity?

633
01:06:53,093 --> 01:06:54,802
- None whatsoever.
- You're sure?

634
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:57,471
My knowledge of this book is profound.

635
01:06:57,639 --> 01:07:00,766
- I wrote a biography of its author.
- Yes, I've read it.

636
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:04,144
Aristide Torchia,
The Devil's Apprentice. Excellent work.

637
01:07:04,312 --> 01:07:05,896
A courageous man.

638
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:10,150
He died for the sake
of this very book in 1667.

639
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:14,071
While studying the black arts in Prague,
he acquired a copy...

640
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:16,615
...of the dread Delomelanicon.

641
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:21,912
This is Torchia's adaptation of that work
which was written by Lucifer himself.

642
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:25,499
After they burned him at the stake,
a secret society was founded...

643
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:29,753
...to perpetuate its memory
and preserve its secrets.

644
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:32,965
The Order of the Silver Serpent.

645
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:36,093
- A sect?
- A kind of witches' coven.

646
01:07:36,261 --> 01:07:38,762
For centuries,
they have met to read from this book...

647
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:41,098
...and worship the prince of darkness.

648
01:07:41,266 --> 01:07:44,268
Today, they have degenerated
into a social club...

649
01:07:44,436 --> 01:07:48,272
...for bored millionaires and celebrities
who use its meetings...

650
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:52,943
...as an excuse to indulge
their jaded sexual appetites.

651
01:07:53,111 --> 01:07:55,863
I, myself, belonged to the order.

652
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:59,491
Years ago,
but time is too precious at my age.

653
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:02,244
Besides, my orgy days are over.

654
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:05,205
I told them to go to the devil.

655
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:08,250
You mean it's all about sex or...

656
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:09,543
Of course not.

657
01:08:09,711 --> 01:08:13,046
They are under the illusion
that they owe their money and success...

658
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:14,757
...to membership in the order.

659
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:15,966
Do they still meet?

660
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:19,678
Every year
on the anniversary of Torchia's death.

661
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:21,472
They'll be meeting very soon now.

662
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:24,308
- And you say they read from this book.
- Not this one.

663
01:08:24,476 --> 01:08:28,896
I took mine back when Liana Telfer
acquired the one in Toledo.

664
01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:30,814
Victor Fargas is a nonbeliever.

665
01:08:30,982 --> 01:08:35,903
He's always refused to participate,
so naturally, they use the Telfer copy.

666
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:38,280
Not that it has ever worked.

667
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:41,366
- Did Andrew Telfer ever take part?
- Telfer?

668
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,327
No, no.

669
01:08:43,495 --> 01:08:47,247
That creature, Liana,
married him for his money.

670
01:08:47,415 --> 01:08:50,667
She comes of an old
and aristocratic French family...

671
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:53,086
...the Saint Martins,
but they were penniless...

672
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:57,174
...so Liana used his dollars
to restore her chateau...

673
01:08:57,342 --> 01:08:59,009
...and buy The Nine Gates.

674
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:02,554
If he ever finds out what his wife
gets up to at these gatherings...

675
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:04,681
...he'll probably kill himself.

676
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:09,102
Funny you should say that, baroness,
he hanged himself last week.

677
01:09:13,775 --> 01:09:17,402
Who, exactly,
are you working for, Mr. Corso?

678
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:21,698
My client's name is irrelevant, baroness.
I'm simply trying to authenticate his copy.

679
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:24,076
The one that Telfer sold him
before he died.

680
01:09:24,244 --> 01:09:28,330
How stupid of me.
I should have guessed.

681
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:32,709
You've outstayed your welcome,
Mr. Corso.

682
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:35,128
I was hoping to examine
your copy in detail.

683
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:37,339
Certainly not.

684
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:40,008
Tell your client,
who can only be Boris Balkan...

685
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:44,805
...to come and examine it himself,
if he dares.

686
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:49,434
Tell him not to send any more
wolves in sheep's clothing.

687
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:53,146
Now, kindly leave.

688
01:09:55,567 --> 01:09:59,236
I'm sorry if I have troubled you.

689
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:00,988
Thank you very much for your time.

690
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:04,908
You don't know what you're
getting yourself into, Mr. Corso.

691
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:08,161
Get out, before it's too late.

692
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:10,831
I'm afraid it already is, baroness.

693
01:10:10,999 --> 01:10:12,583
Good day.

694
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:06,149
They're broken.

695
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:09,194
You should be more careful.

696
01:14:24,335 --> 01:14:27,420
- I need a favor, Gruber.
- Certainly, Mr. Corso.

697
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:29,464
Liana Telfer.

698
01:14:29,632 --> 01:14:33,802
Maiden name de Saint Martin,
40ish, brunette, dishy.

699
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:37,180
Probably accompanied by...

700
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:46,815
...a black gentleman with closely cropped
platinum blond hair and a mustache.

701
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:49,317
I wanna know if they're staying
at some hotel here.

702
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:51,361
- Take a little time.
- Yes, of course.

703
01:14:51,529 --> 01:14:53,738
Start with the five-stars,
that's your best bet.

704
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:55,657
- Very well, sir.
- All right.

705
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:58,034
Are you feeling all right?

706
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:01,621
I've felt better, Gruber. Thanks.

707
01:15:01,789 --> 01:15:04,040
Let me know if you locate them.

708
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:22,350
Put this against the back of your neck.

709
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:37,199
You were really great down there
by the river.

710
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:39,451
I haven't thanked you for that.

711
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:22,786
All right, look.

712
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:26,456
I think it's about time you told me
what's going on here.

713
01:16:26,874 --> 01:16:29,417
- Someone's after your book.
- No kidding.

714
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:31,962
And you, where do you fit into it?

715
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:42,430
Yeah?

716
01:16:43,808 --> 01:16:45,767
There's a call for you.

717
01:16:47,311 --> 01:16:49,980
May I take it in reception, please?

718
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:53,483
All right, I'll be right down.

719
01:17:07,123 --> 01:17:09,124
- Yes?
- Anything new?

720
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:11,584
Oh, his master's voice again.

721
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:13,712
No, not much aside from the fact...

722
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:17,382
...that someone's tried to take my life
a couple of times.

723
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:21,011
Oh, yes. Fargas has been murdered.

724
01:17:22,513 --> 01:17:24,848
Murdered? How do you know?

725
01:17:25,016 --> 01:17:27,225
I saw him. And his copy.

726
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:29,519
Or what was left of it, anyway.

727
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:33,315
Someone had snatched the engravings
and tried to burn the rest.

728
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:36,985
- What do you make of it?
- That's tragic. It's tragic.

729
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:39,946
What about Baroness Kessler?
How did you get on today?

730
01:17:40,114 --> 01:17:42,824
- Where exactly are you?
- What about her copy?

731
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:44,826
No. Why do I get the impression...

732
01:17:44,994 --> 01:17:47,245
...that you've been
down my neck the entire time?

733
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:52,208
You're an investment of mine, Mr. Corso.
I'm merely looking after it.

734
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:57,380
The old woman swears
her copy's authentic...

735
01:17:57,548 --> 01:18:00,508
...but I didn't get a chance
to examine it closely.

736
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:04,763
She threw me out as soon as she
guessed that you were behind my visit.

737
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:07,974
You aren't exactly in her good books,
if you know what I mean.

738
01:18:08,142 --> 01:18:10,352
- You must see her again.
- What, are you kidding?

739
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:14,397
- Have you seen her secretary?
- Try the lunch break.

740
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:18,026
Hello?

741
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,556
Do you have a photocopy machine
back there?

742
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:49,933
Oh, yes, monsieur.

743
01:18:50,101 --> 01:18:53,436
- May I use it?
- Of course, monsieur.

744
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:56,160
Yes. Hello, baroness, it's me,
the wolf in sheep's clothing.

745
01:21:56,328 --> 01:22:00,373
I thought I made myself quite clear,
Mr. Corso.

746
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:04,794
Well, I've got something
for you, baroness.

747
01:22:04,962 --> 01:22:06,838
A kind of peace offering.

748
01:22:07,006 --> 01:22:09,549
Will you allow me to give it to you?

749
01:22:09,717 --> 01:22:11,467
Please?

750
01:22:37,036 --> 01:22:38,828
First, let me apologize.

751
01:22:38,996 --> 01:22:42,874
I should've told you right away
that I'm working for Boris Balkan.

752
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:47,003
It was foolish of me to think that I could
deceive someone as astute as yourself.

753
01:22:47,171 --> 01:22:52,175
- So please forgive me.
- Flattery will get you nowhere, Mr. Corso.

754
01:22:52,426 --> 01:22:54,177
Get on with it.

755
01:22:54,345 --> 01:22:55,887
Right.

756
01:22:57,264 --> 01:22:58,848
These...

757
01:23:00,476 --> 01:23:02,268
...are for you.

758
01:23:04,313 --> 01:23:06,022
What is this?

759
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:08,691
What is this supposed to be?

760
01:23:09,151 --> 01:23:12,278
You said that your knowledge
of The Nine Gates was extensive...

761
01:23:12,446 --> 01:23:15,740
...but did you ever compare your copy
with the other two?

762
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:17,533
No.

763
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:20,411
- Why?
- Well, you should.

764
01:23:20,579 --> 01:23:23,915
These are copies of the engravings
in Balkan's book.

765
01:23:24,083 --> 01:23:26,668
You'll find that some of them differ
from yours.

766
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:28,628
Differ?

767
01:23:29,213 --> 01:23:32,840
So you question my book's authenticity,
do you?

768
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:35,510
If that's your peace offering,
you can take it and go.

769
01:23:35,678 --> 01:23:38,054
My Nine Gates is absolutely genuine.

770
01:23:38,222 --> 01:23:39,931
I don't dispute that, baroness.

771
01:23:40,099 --> 01:23:43,017
In my opinion,
all three copies are genuine.

772
01:23:43,185 --> 01:23:45,520
But the fact remains,
they display variations.

773
01:23:45,688 --> 01:23:47,814
Variations?

774
01:23:48,399 --> 01:23:51,693
If that were true,
it would be a revelation.

775
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,069
What makes you so sure?

776
01:23:55,114 --> 01:23:57,740
I've already compared these
with the Fargas engravings.

777
01:23:57,908 --> 01:24:00,201
And in his book...

778
01:24:01,495 --> 01:24:04,747
...the keys were in the other hand.

779
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:08,584
Here, the doorway wasn't bricked up.

780
01:24:09,336 --> 01:24:10,586
And in this one...

781
01:24:10,754 --> 01:24:14,257
...the man was hanging by the other leg.

782
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:33,276
- Well?
- Well, what?

783
01:24:35,571 --> 01:24:38,322
Look closely, baroness.

784
01:24:39,116 --> 01:24:40,533
The turrets.

785
01:24:40,701 --> 01:24:42,452
Three in yours...

786
01:24:42,619 --> 01:24:44,537
...four in Balkan's.

787
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:57,967
Amazing.

788
01:24:58,135 --> 01:25:01,804
I'm convinced there'll be a third one
in here somewhere.

789
01:25:01,972 --> 01:25:05,516
Three variations in three copies
makes nine.

790
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:08,478
Coincidence, or something more?

791
01:25:08,771 --> 01:25:13,524
Maybe Torchia hid the secret
of the Ninth Gate in three books, not one.

792
01:25:15,194 --> 01:25:17,278
I must admit I'm impressed.

793
01:25:17,446 --> 01:25:20,990
This puts an entirely different complexion
on the matter.

794
01:25:21,158 --> 01:25:25,661
You have my permission
to investigate further, Mr. Corso.

795
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:27,747
Take as long as you need.

796
01:25:43,597 --> 01:25:47,308
My permission did not extend
to that, Mr. Corso.

797
01:25:48,519 --> 01:25:51,103
Nobody smokes in my library.

798
01:28:35,268 --> 01:28:37,019
Baroness?

799
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:27,314
Excuse me, there's something missing
from my room.

800
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:29,358
Has anyone been up there
while I was out?

801
01:31:29,526 --> 01:31:31,318
Only your wife, monsieur.

802
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:33,863
My wife? I don't have a wife.

803
01:31:34,030 --> 01:31:35,948
Excuse me, monsieur.

804
01:31:40,078 --> 01:31:42,037
For you, sir.

805
01:31:47,669 --> 01:31:50,796
- Yes?
- What news?

806
01:31:52,299 --> 01:31:53,757
News?

807
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:55,050
Let me see.

808
01:31:55,218 --> 01:31:56,510
Well...

809
01:31:56,678 --> 01:32:01,056
Yes, the good news is that I got to
examine the old woman's book...

810
01:32:01,224 --> 01:32:03,517
...and three of her engravings
were signed "LCF."

811
01:32:03,685 --> 01:32:08,522
The bad news is that someone strangled
her and made a bonfire of her collection.

812
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:12,776
- Now, that's tragic, wouldn't you say?
- You took the words out my mouth.

813
01:32:13,069 --> 01:32:16,071
Yes. It's the Fargas story all over again.

814
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:18,657
I'm of the mind
that they tore out the engravings...

815
01:32:18,825 --> 01:32:20,492
...before they torched the place.

816
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:22,244
That makes two sets they've got.

817
01:32:22,412 --> 01:32:24,413
And my copy?

818
01:32:24,831 --> 01:32:27,541
Well, I learned my lesson, fortunately.

819
01:32:27,709 --> 01:32:29,710
I don't carry it around with me anymore.

820
01:32:29,878 --> 01:32:32,087
Otherwise, it might've gone up
in smoke.

821
01:32:32,255 --> 01:32:34,882
Excellent. Good thinking.

822
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:36,800
Well, with two copies gone...

823
01:32:36,968 --> 01:32:38,886
...that seems to conclude
your assignment.

824
01:32:39,054 --> 01:32:41,096
It only remains for you
to return my book.

825
01:32:41,264 --> 01:32:44,475
I'm staying at the Ritz. You can
pick up your check at the same time.

826
01:32:44,643 --> 01:32:46,769
Shall we say in half an hour?

827
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,981
There's more bad news.

828
01:32:52,484 --> 01:32:55,277
- I don't have it.
- You don't have it?

829
01:32:55,862 --> 01:32:58,530
Someone lifted it from my room.

830
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:05,746
Listen to me very carefully, Mr. Corso.

831
01:33:06,456 --> 01:33:08,707
I think you may already have
some idea...

832
01:33:08,875 --> 01:33:13,295
...of the lengths to which I am prepared
to go when I want something.

833
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:19,260
Unless you recover my property
in double-quick time...

834
01:33:19,636 --> 01:33:23,138
...you'll discover
just how far that can be.

835
01:33:34,985 --> 01:33:36,235
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

836
01:33:36,403 --> 01:33:38,237
The book, where is it?

837
01:33:38,405 --> 01:33:40,531
Would I be here if I took it?

838
01:33:40,740 --> 01:33:43,409
You should know better by now.

839
01:33:48,665 --> 01:33:51,083
I must apologize for my young colleague,
Mr. Corso...

840
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:53,252
...that was unpardonable of him.

841
01:33:53,420 --> 01:33:55,129
Is that her?

842
01:33:55,297 --> 01:33:56,297
No, monsieur.

843
01:33:56,464 --> 01:33:59,341
She was tall, dark hair,
very chic, very elegant.

844
01:33:59,509 --> 01:34:02,177
Which reminds me, sir,
I have the information you wanted.

845
01:34:02,345 --> 01:34:04,305
The lady and gentleman
you mentioned...

846
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:08,142
...they are staying
at the Plaza Athénée Hotel...

847
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:11,520
...Suite 209, 211.

848
01:34:11,688 --> 01:34:13,689
Thank you very much, Gruber.
I owe you one.

849
01:34:13,857 --> 01:34:16,275
I need a taxi, quick.

850
01:34:18,403 --> 01:34:22,114
Send this to Mr. Balkan at the Ritz.
That's B-A-L-K-A-N.

851
01:34:25,118 --> 01:34:28,662
- Fax it, immediately.
- Certainly, sir.

852
01:34:29,831 --> 01:34:31,915
Always a pleasure to be of service.

853
01:34:32,083 --> 01:34:33,292
You coming?

854
01:34:53,355 --> 01:34:55,439
What do you plan to do
if you see them?

855
01:34:55,607 --> 01:34:58,067
Probably hide behind you.

856
01:35:51,788 --> 01:35:53,789
Whoa, that's them. That's them.

857
01:35:56,292 --> 01:35:59,670
We should grab a taxi
before they take off.

858
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:02,131
Let's go.

859
01:36:19,482 --> 01:36:21,316
They're going.

860
01:36:54,434 --> 01:36:56,018
Coming?

861
01:37:07,155 --> 01:37:09,281
Couldn't you pick something
less conspicuous?

862
01:37:09,449 --> 01:37:10,866
Don't be so picky.

863
01:37:11,034 --> 01:37:14,536
Some people would give their eyeteeth
for a ride in this.

864
01:37:50,573 --> 01:37:54,409
Listen, we can't sit on their tail forever,
they're bound to smell a rat.

865
01:38:18,434 --> 01:38:19,434
How do I look?

866
01:38:21,729 --> 01:38:23,730
You look ridiculous.

867
01:38:31,281 --> 01:38:32,906
Sit tight.

868
01:39:21,623 --> 01:39:23,498
Take your pick.

869
01:39:24,042 --> 01:39:25,417
No, you.

870
01:39:25,585 --> 01:39:28,295
- You know everything.
- If you say so.

871
01:39:41,851 --> 01:39:43,560
We lost them.

872
01:39:43,728 --> 01:39:45,687
Well, not at this speed.

873
01:39:45,855 --> 01:39:47,189
Must've gone the other way.

874
01:39:47,357 --> 01:39:50,317
You mean,
I don't know everything after all?

875
01:39:50,485 --> 01:39:52,361
Turn around.

876
01:40:05,583 --> 01:40:08,085
30ish, brunette, dishy.

877
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:11,004
- What was her name again?
- Telfer. Liana Telfer.

878
01:40:11,172 --> 01:40:13,382
No, her maiden name.

879
01:40:14,425 --> 01:40:17,052
- Saint Martin.
- Look.

880
01:41:06,894 --> 01:41:08,979
The chateau, I knew it.

881
01:41:32,044 --> 01:41:37,883
Keep going.

882
01:43:56,355 --> 01:43:58,607
See them anywhere?

883
01:44:01,861 --> 01:44:03,486
No.

884
01:45:31,826 --> 01:45:34,995
- Sorry to intrude on you like this.
- What are you doing here?

885
01:45:35,162 --> 01:45:38,873
I just dropped by to pick up
the book you stole from my room.

886
01:45:39,041 --> 01:45:42,711
- That book is mine.
- We've been through all this before.

887
01:45:42,878 --> 01:45:44,462
My husband gave it to me.

888
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:46,548
- Well...
- It wasn't his to sell.

889
01:45:46,716 --> 01:45:48,675
Sold it to get back at you.
What happened?

890
01:45:48,843 --> 01:45:50,969
- Catch you with that albino?
- How dare you?

891
01:45:51,762 --> 01:45:53,805
Keep an eye on her.

892
01:45:55,057 --> 01:45:56,349
Don't.

893
01:45:56,517 --> 01:45:58,893
Be careful. She bites.

894
01:46:10,031 --> 01:46:11,614
Hi.

895
01:46:14,910 --> 01:46:16,244
Don't move.

896
01:46:16,412 --> 01:46:18,413
Either one of you.

897
01:46:18,581 --> 01:46:20,457
Get the book.

898
01:46:34,722 --> 01:46:37,432
Don't kill them up here,
you'll make a mess.

899
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:39,768
Take them downstairs.

900
01:46:40,519 --> 01:46:41,936
You, go first.

901
01:46:42,104 --> 01:46:43,813
And you.

902
01:46:56,035 --> 01:46:57,786
Down.

903
01:47:12,218 --> 01:47:14,135
Open the door.

904
01:47:26,690 --> 01:47:28,316
Watch out.

905
01:47:45,918 --> 01:47:47,752
I didn't know you had it in you.

906
01:48:18,701 --> 01:48:20,702
You stay here and cover me.

907
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:22,871
I'm going down.

908
01:49:03,746 --> 01:49:05,246
Who's that?

909
01:49:06,373 --> 01:49:11,586
Mumbo jumbo, mumbo jumbo,
mumbo jumbo.

910
01:49:18,844 --> 01:49:21,763
Look around you, all of you.
What do you see?

911
01:49:21,931 --> 01:49:25,642
A bunch of buffoons, in fancy dress.

912
01:49:25,809 --> 01:49:29,229
Think the prince of darkness
would actually deign to manifest himself...

913
01:49:29,396 --> 01:49:32,148
...before the likes of you?
He never has, and he never will.

914
01:49:32,316 --> 01:49:33,775
Never.

915
01:49:35,027 --> 01:49:36,861
You read from his book...

916
01:49:37,029 --> 01:49:40,114
...but you have no conception
of its true power.

917
01:49:40,282 --> 01:49:42,533
I, alone, have grasped its secret.

918
01:49:42,701 --> 01:49:45,620
I, alone, have fathomed
the master's grand design.

919
01:49:45,788 --> 01:49:50,166
I, alone, am worthy to enjoy the fruits
of that discovery.

920
01:49:50,334 --> 01:49:53,127
Absolute power
to determine my own destiny.

921
01:49:53,295 --> 01:49:56,005
You're insane, Boris.
Give it back to me.

922
01:49:56,173 --> 01:49:58,716
You, Liana de Saint Martin...

923
01:49:58,884 --> 01:50:02,136
...you're even guiltier than the rest
of this pathetic rabble.

924
01:50:02,304 --> 01:50:05,640
You have at least some idea of what
this book can do in the right hands.

925
01:50:05,808 --> 01:50:08,810
Yet, you lend yourself
to these farcical proceedings...

926
01:50:08,978 --> 01:50:12,897
...these orgies of aging flesh
conducted in the master's name.

927
01:50:13,065 --> 01:50:14,148
You're a charlatan.

928
01:50:42,011 --> 01:50:45,013
Don't, Corso. Don't.

929
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:55,356
Let it be.

930
01:51:29,058 --> 01:51:31,768
- What is it with you?
- He just murdered someone in public.

931
01:51:31,935 --> 01:51:33,728
You're off the hook...

932
01:51:33,896 --> 01:51:35,396
...for the other killings.

933
01:51:35,564 --> 01:51:37,648
- You should be grateful.
- I'm ecstatic.

934
01:51:37,816 --> 01:51:40,401
You're out of a job. It's over.
What more do you want?

935
01:51:40,569 --> 01:51:42,403
You know what.

936
01:52:08,263 --> 01:52:10,348
Not taking me for a ride?

937
01:52:10,766 --> 01:52:14,602
- You were working for him all along.
- Funny, I thought you were.

938
01:53:01,150 --> 01:53:02,942
Shit.

939
01:57:11,566 --> 01:57:15,778
Yes.

940
01:57:15,946 --> 01:57:17,697
That's it.

941
01:57:18,240 --> 01:57:20,491
Precisely.

942
01:57:21,743 --> 01:57:24,078
All is in readiness.

943
01:57:25,122 --> 01:57:26,914
One...

944
01:57:27,082 --> 01:57:28,749
...four...

945
01:57:28,917 --> 01:57:33,754
...three, six, seven...

946
01:57:33,922 --> 01:57:39,468
...five, eight, woo, nine.

947
01:57:40,178 --> 01:57:42,263
The enigma is solved at last.

948
01:57:44,433 --> 01:57:46,016
To travel in silence...

949
01:57:46,184 --> 01:57:48,561
...by a long and circuitous route...

950
01:57:48,729 --> 01:57:53,232
...to brave the arrows of misfortune
and fear neither noose, nor fire.

951
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:57,945
To play the greatest of all games
and win, foregoing no expense...

952
01:57:58,113 --> 01:58:02,533
...is to mock the vicissitudes of fate
and gain at last the key...

953
01:58:02,701 --> 01:58:04,994
...that will unlock...

954
01:58:05,746 --> 01:58:08,247
...the ninth gate.

955
01:58:12,961 --> 01:58:13,961
Corso.

956
01:58:14,629 --> 01:58:18,257
What were you expecting,
an apparition?

957
01:58:19,426 --> 01:58:23,053
You're not wanted here, Mr. Corso.
Leave.

958
01:58:23,221 --> 01:58:26,015
I'm the only apparition
you'll see tonight.

959
01:58:26,183 --> 01:58:28,476
You'll find a check waiting
at my New York office.

960
01:58:28,643 --> 01:58:30,644
Payment in full.

961
01:58:30,812 --> 01:58:32,605
You killed for those.

962
01:58:32,773 --> 01:58:35,816
- They're worth more than money.
- Infinitely more.

963
01:58:35,984 --> 01:58:37,985
But they happen to be mine.

964
01:58:38,153 --> 01:58:39,987
Not yours.

965
01:58:41,072 --> 01:58:43,574
You know something, Corso?

966
01:58:44,159 --> 01:58:46,494
In spite of our differences...

967
01:58:46,661 --> 01:58:49,163
...I have a soft spot for you.

968
01:58:49,331 --> 01:58:52,374
- I'm touched.
- We have something in common.

969
01:58:52,542 --> 01:58:54,460
We share the same passion.

970
01:58:54,628 --> 01:58:57,505
You've developed the same obsession,
haven't you?

971
01:58:57,672 --> 01:59:01,217
Unfortunately for you,
only one of us is destined to fulfill it.

972
01:59:01,384 --> 01:59:03,511
You're out of your depth. Kindly go.

973
01:59:05,180 --> 01:59:07,097
I'm not leaving here empty-handed.

974
01:59:07,265 --> 01:59:09,517
Don't even think about it.

975
01:59:10,393 --> 01:59:12,311
Stand aside.

976
01:59:12,854 --> 01:59:14,897
I credited you with more finesse.

977
01:59:15,065 --> 01:59:18,984
- You heard me. Stand back.
- Put that away, it's not your style.

978
01:59:40,674 --> 01:59:44,051
It seems you've found your proper niche
at last.

979
01:59:44,219 --> 01:59:46,053
I like that.

980
01:59:46,388 --> 01:59:48,055
Now...

981
01:59:49,057 --> 01:59:51,225
...you can watch.

982
01:59:59,109 --> 02:00:02,236
I'm entering uncharted territory.

983
02:00:02,445 --> 02:00:07,825
Taking the road that leads to equality
with God.

984
02:00:22,883 --> 02:00:24,842
You can't come with me.

985
02:00:25,010 --> 02:00:29,179
I must travel alone,
but you may look on...

986
02:00:29,431 --> 02:00:30,681
...and marvel.

987
02:00:30,849 --> 02:00:34,685
- That's very kind of you.
- Indeed it is.

988
02:00:37,105 --> 02:00:40,190
There have been men
who have been burned alive...

989
02:00:40,358 --> 02:00:43,736
...or disemboweled
for just a glimpse...

990
02:00:43,904 --> 02:00:48,949
...of what you are about to witness.

991
02:00:56,207 --> 02:00:58,584
I give you my allegiance, master.

992
02:00:58,752 --> 02:01:01,629
I pledge myself to you, body and soul.

993
02:01:01,796 --> 02:01:04,965
Let me fear neither noose,
nor fire, nor poison.

994
02:01:05,133 --> 02:01:07,092
Erase me from the book of life...

995
02:01:07,260 --> 02:01:09,762
...inscribe me
in the black book of death.

996
02:01:09,930 --> 02:01:13,057
Admit me to the ninth gate.

997
02:01:13,224 --> 02:01:14,558
Let it be so.

998
02:01:17,812 --> 02:01:21,190
Let it be so now.

999
02:01:31,826 --> 02:01:33,535
Yes.

1000
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:38,958
I feel the power surge through me
like an electric current...

1001
02:01:39,125 --> 02:01:42,336
...rendering me capable of any feat
of mind or body.

1002
02:01:42,504 --> 02:01:44,046
I'm invulnerable.

1003
02:01:44,214 --> 02:01:46,423
I'm invincible.

1004
02:01:48,176 --> 02:01:52,763
I could float on air,
I could walk on water.

1005
02:01:56,685 --> 02:01:57,685
Behold.

1006
02:01:57,852 --> 02:01:59,812
I plunge my hands in fire.

1007
02:01:59,980 --> 02:02:02,314
I feel no heat.

1008
02:02:02,482 --> 02:02:05,359
That's just great. Give us another one.

1009
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:27,506
It's miraculous.

1010
02:02:27,924 --> 02:02:31,593
I feel nothing. Nothing at all.

1011
02:05:41,409 --> 02:05:43,160
Is that it?

1012
02:05:43,912 --> 02:05:44,995
Is the game over?

1013
02:05:45,872 --> 02:05:47,247
For Balkan, yes.

1014
02:05:47,415 --> 02:05:48,749
Not for you.

1015
02:05:48,917 --> 02:05:50,500
Why didn't it work for Balkan?

1016
02:05:50,668 --> 02:05:52,586
The ninth engraving was a forgery.

1017
02:05:56,257 --> 02:05:58,300
Where's the real one?

1018
02:05:59,928 --> 02:06:01,678
I want it.

1019
02:06:04,098 --> 02:06:05,432
You're running low on gas.

1020
02:07:45,199 --> 02:07:46,783
Pepe Lopez.

1021
02:07:46,951 --> 02:07:48,535
Ricardo Herrera.

1022
02:07:52,040 --> 02:07:54,041
Do you speak English?
