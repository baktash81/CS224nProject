1
00:04:18,122 --> 00:04:20,059
Pull the curtains

2
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:24,531
- Call the ambulance
- Okay Dr. Hisham

3
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:27,133
- Where's her dressing room?
- Her dressing room

4
00:04:27,331 --> 00:04:29,201
Hisham

5
00:04:43,315 --> 00:04:44,316
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think l'm going?

6
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:46,386
- l'll go with Shams to the hospital
- It's not her first time

7
00:04:46,517 --> 00:04:48,355
she's just trying to get some
attention as always, she'll be just fine

8
00:04:48,486 --> 00:04:49,588
we must be sure she's okay

9
00:04:49,888 --> 00:04:51,791
what about the TV interview?
You forgot about it?

10
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:53,326
you forgot that you're
the head of the band?

11
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,528
no time to play along with her,
or else we're screwed

12
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:58,032
come on, we'll go
to the hospital later

13
00:04:59,097 --> 00:05:00,533
let's go

14
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,105
How could this happen Hisham?

15
00:05:04,235 --> 00:05:07,343
She's committing suicide,
why did you let her get on stage again?

16
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,345
She's su_ering from a serious crisis and
must be convinced of the primary treatment

17
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:14,417
and just like you already said,
she'd rather die on stage

18
00:05:14,546 --> 00:05:17,019
she thinks it's for her best interest

19
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,955
The patient doesn't know
what's best for him, Hisham

20
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:22,089
That's why l'm trying to give
her a psychological treatment first

21
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,058
to accept the physical one

22
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,195
There we go again with
your psychological treatment

23
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:31,835
You make me feel you're a shrink
not a specialist in blood related diseases

24
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:34,402
The psychological treatment is the
first step towards the primary treatment

25
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,370
These are just
virtual theories, Hisham

26
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,040
A blood cancer patient
is in need of chemotherapy

27
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,142
not of a psychological session

28
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:48,918
- There is Dr. Hisham
- What's wrong Dr.?

29
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:49,048
Don't you worry, your girl just woke
up and she's gonna be perfectly fine

30
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,087
Don't you worry, your girl just woke
up and she's gonna be perfectly fine

31
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,222
- Can l see her?
- l'd rather not

32
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,493
- Let her get some rest
- What about us Dr.? Can we see her?

33
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:00,029
- Please let us see her
- Please Dr.

34
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,067
This is a hospital,
you can see her but not all at once

35
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:07,304
Can l speak to you Mrs. Leila?

36
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:09,905
Dr. Hisham Ali Abd El Hamid

37
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,673
l'd better tell you the truth Mrs. Leila

38
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,240
Your daughter's state is critical

39
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,178
since she won't quit dancing
and refuses the chemotherapy

40
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,515
l don't know what to do Dr.
she can't stop dancing and perfòrming

41
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:21,184
- It's in her blood
- And cancer is in her blood too

42
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:22,284
What should we do?

43
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:26,324
You should help me
convince her whatever it takes

44
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:29,927
- How can we do that?
- We're gonna have to find that out

45
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:57,155
Why are you still awake?
Shouldn't you be sound asleep by now?

46
00:06:57,286 --> 00:07:01,193
- What can l do? It's love
- Is that so?

47
00:07:01,323 --> 00:07:04,595
lt seems to me we
haven't got any chance

48
00:07:04,961 --> 00:07:07,332
Tell me quick
before your son arrives

49
00:07:08,097 --> 00:07:10,000
Don't you worry, my lips are sealed

50
00:07:10,132 --> 00:07:11,701
God forgive you Hind

51
00:07:12,034 --> 00:07:15,607
you think l can even think about
another woman after Um Yussef?

52
00:08:25,543 --> 00:08:27,413
Daddy

53
00:08:30,682 --> 00:08:32,552
You won't give me today's hug?

54
00:08:32,684 --> 00:08:36,123
You're late, you didn't
tell me a bed time story

55
00:08:36,254 --> 00:08:38,257
Give me my hug
and l'll tell you a story

56
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,327
Go on, come here

57
00:08:41,426 --> 00:08:43,429
How nice

58
00:08:46,464 --> 00:08:48,635
Yeah, that's it

59
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:52,307
Go back to your room and l'll
be right with you once l get changed

60
00:08:52,437 --> 00:08:54,207
Go quick

61
00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:58,078
Can't you tell him a bed time story?

62
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,612
He got used to you

63
00:08:59,745 --> 00:09:03,118
When l start telling him one,
he goes, dad says it di_erently

64
00:09:03,248 --> 00:09:04,216
l'm really at the
end of my tether, Hind

65
00:09:04,349 --> 00:09:05,719
l can't even count on you to help me in this

66
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:07,754
Cut it out, you sound just like your son

67
00:09:07,886 --> 00:09:09,724
l'll come with you to see
how you tell him the story

68
00:09:09,855 --> 00:09:15,165
- And do likewise afterwards
- You can't, coz l'm really gifted

69
00:09:25,305 --> 00:09:28,444
Let's go Yussef,
Ramy's late to the nursery

70
00:09:28,975 --> 00:09:31,779
lf you just listen to me and
smell the ocean every morning

71
00:09:31,878 --> 00:09:33,013
You'll change your mind

72
00:09:33,146 --> 00:09:35,885
l'm convinced more and more everyday
that you got transferred to Hurghada

73
00:09:35,982 --> 00:09:37,351
Coz you're addicted to the ocean smell

74
00:09:37,684 --> 00:09:41,925
Notjust the ocean,
l'm addicted to many more things

75
00:09:43,189 --> 00:09:44,324
On your way back,
you'll drop by the telephone exchange

76
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:46,026
pay the bill and run some errands

77
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,233
Just let him focus on his work,
and we can take care of that

78
00:09:50,331 --> 00:09:55,173
- He's got a car, it'll be much easier on him
- Don't bother dad, she's made a habit of it

79
00:09:55,302 --> 00:09:56,904
- For ever
- For ever

80
00:09:57,036 --> 00:09:59,242
lt's your fault, if you want me
to change, you'd better teach me

81
00:09:59,406 --> 00:10:01,510
No darling, this is much easier

82
00:10:01,941 --> 00:10:05,115
- Good morning Mr.
- Good morning

83
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,120
Let's go dear

84
00:10:12,286 --> 00:10:14,156
Do you need anything?

85
00:10:18,926 --> 00:10:22,566
- Is there anyone with him?
- No

86
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:34,180
- Good morning sir, l finished the plan
- Put it there, l'll check it out later

87
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:38,850
Have pity on yourself, you're
sick and you must see a doctor

88
00:10:38,946 --> 00:10:42,186
- l went to see a doctor Imad
- And everything's okay?

89
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,890
He told me to do some blood tests,
and l'll go see him today with the results

90
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:51,632
Do me a favor and get some
rest until it's time to go see the doctor

91
00:10:53,962 --> 00:10:59,873
- Don't be angry with him
- l'm not, l'm angry with myself

92
00:11:00,803 --> 00:11:05,044
l should have felt earlier that
he doesn't care for me anymore

93
00:11:05,173 --> 00:11:09,148
He was dancing with me but our
moves were out of synchronization

94
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:10,980
Calm down now, your health
should be your main concern now

95
00:11:11,113 --> 00:11:13,785
Once you get out of here,
l'll do whatever you want

96
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,819
l'm not waiting
until they check me out

97
00:11:15,985 --> 00:11:17,988
l'll go talk to him and settle this right now

98
00:11:18,087 --> 00:11:20,892
You'll get out especially to see him out?

99
00:11:21,057 --> 00:11:24,396
- Why?
- l don't wanna see him here

100
00:11:24,694 --> 00:11:28,067
l don't want him to give me that
compassionate look, l won't take it

101
00:11:28,197 --> 00:11:31,436
lt's not wrong at all to feel
compassion towards each other

102
00:11:31,735 --> 00:11:38,080
But l must feel his love first,
or else it would just be mere pity

103
00:11:39,141 --> 00:11:40,778
Come on in

104
00:11:41,245 --> 00:11:43,916
- Good morning
- Good morning doctor

105
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,318
You still wanna get out
and get back later tonight

106
00:11:46,816 --> 00:11:50,723
Please doctor, l have an important
meeting and l can't make it at the hospital

107
00:11:50,854 --> 00:11:54,161
l promised you l'll get back later
tonight to start my chemotherapy

108
00:11:54,258 --> 00:11:58,132
- There's still plenty of time
- l know you'll come back in time

109
00:11:58,262 --> 00:12:04,708
because you're sure how important
your good health is, for every one of us

110
00:13:05,064 --> 00:13:08,938
- Thank God you're okay
- Thank God you're okay

111
00:13:17,376 --> 00:13:19,481
l'm sorry l couldn't come to the hospital

112
00:13:19,712 --> 00:13:22,249
but you know we must be
rehearsing for the next performance

113
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:26,188
The Jezel ballet performance,
the story is very interesting

114
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:30,059
the heroin dies when she sees
her love get engaged with someone else

115
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,162
l've always dreamed to dance with
the Bolshoi band when it comes to Egypt

116
00:13:33,293 --> 00:13:35,096
Never mind the Bolshoi band

117
00:13:35,228 --> 00:13:37,865
We'll be dancing together
when you're perfectly okay

118
00:13:37,998 --> 00:13:40,102
- But it won't work like this
- Why?

119
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,476
Coz you'll never be the hero
for which the heroin dies in the end

120
00:13:52,045 --> 00:13:53,915
The Bolshoi band chooses
the Egyptian ballerina Shams

121
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,750
for their next performance in Giza

122
00:13:55,883 --> 00:13:57,285
Congratulations, this is great

123
00:13:57,485 --> 00:13:59,755
l guess that she'll
succumb to treatment now

124
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:01,423
she wouldn't wanna
waste a lifetime opportunity

125
00:14:01,555 --> 00:14:03,157
This is a great idea,
give her the good news

126
00:14:03,457 --> 00:14:06,429
- And l'll try to convince her
- Thank you Dr. Hisham

127
00:14:06,594 --> 00:14:08,965
- What have you done?
- It's okay mom

128
00:14:09,196 --> 00:14:11,267
This time, l've settled everything

129
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:15,205
l got rid of Marwan
and l'll get rid of this disease

130
00:14:15,469 --> 00:14:18,041
and l'll perform
with the Bolshoi band

131
00:14:18,172 --> 00:14:20,944
you just stay by my side

132
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,051
l'll always be here, honey

133
00:15:04,554 --> 00:15:06,991
What now? You'll keep gazing
at those results for ever?

134
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:09,861
- l'm ill or what?
- No, it's nothing

135
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:11,928
There must be something
wrong with these tests

136
00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:12,995
What?

137
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,832
You think that a human
being is like a machine

138
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,969
or a concrete formwork
like the ones you do?

139
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:21,306
- Since when do you smoke?
- l just like to indulge myself

140
00:15:21,604 --> 00:15:25,211
What am l supposed to do?
Is there any medicine l can take?

141
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:30,852
Yussef, l think you'd better
go check another doctor

142
00:15:31,047 --> 00:15:37,259
There is a doctor in Egypt called Hisham
Ali, he's a very competent specialist

143
00:15:38,722 --> 00:15:41,093
Specialist in what?

144
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,083
Cairo, 15O

145
00:16:21,932 --> 00:16:25,640
- These are the blood test results
- Thank you Safaa

146
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:50,299
ln such cases, we must
tell the patient everything

147
00:16:50,562 --> 00:16:54,236
coz it's a responsibility
he must share with us

148
00:16:54,567 --> 00:17:02,114
unfortunately, you've
got leukemia, blood cancer

149
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:08,018
Yussef, just like God gave us life

150
00:17:47,354 --> 00:17:51,028
How much time
do l have left, doctor?

151
00:17:54,028 --> 00:17:56,767
You're an educated person

152
00:17:57,497 --> 00:18:03,108
There's always hope as long
as we put our trust in the Lord

153
00:18:04,171 --> 00:18:11,719
One year, months, one month

154
00:18:12,513 --> 00:18:15,485
l just told you
you're an educated man

155
00:18:15,749 --> 00:18:19,524
That's why you must start
your treatment starting tomorrow

156
00:18:21,156 --> 00:18:23,093
Tomorrow?

157
00:18:25,093 --> 00:18:29,167
lt's better to start as soon as possible
to have the best possibilities of success

158
00:18:29,263 --> 00:18:31,902
We must start tomorrow

159
00:18:33,334 --> 00:18:35,672
Tomorrow?

160
00:18:36,705 --> 00:18:43,652
One year, one month? Tomorrow?

161
00:18:44,746 --> 00:18:48,787
Hey mister, Mr. Yussef

162
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:52,720
- l'm sorry
- No, l'm sorry

163
00:20:03,794 --> 00:20:06,432
l didn't mean to...

164
00:21:32,686 --> 00:21:35,057
You miss me so?

165
00:21:36,923 --> 00:21:40,329
Yeah of course, of course

166
00:21:40,727 --> 00:21:43,364
l missed you too

167
00:21:45,665 --> 00:21:47,168
Why is your hand so cold?

168
00:21:47,334 --> 00:21:49,070
l drove all the way home,
and l'm a bit tired

169
00:21:49,135 --> 00:21:51,138
- l'll go to bed
- No, we're gonna have dinner first

170
00:21:51,305 --> 00:21:53,976
- l'm not hungry
- You'll soon be

171
00:21:55,609 --> 00:21:58,781
- What do you think?
- It's very nice

172
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:03,621
Take a seat, happy king,
l'll bring the food right away

173
00:22:08,756 --> 00:22:12,797
Wash your hands and
face and l'll serve dinner

174
00:22:34,215 --> 00:22:37,055
l've prepared you some tasty food

175
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,293
l've got you a surprise
you wouldn't believe

176
00:22:42,557 --> 00:22:46,131
Today, l told a story to Ramy and
he went to sleep with a smile on his face

177
00:22:46,294 --> 00:22:50,201
Really? Really Hind?

178
00:22:50,766 --> 00:22:55,074
Yeah Yussef,
is it that important to you?

179
00:22:55,236 --> 00:23:01,683
Of course, it's one
Iess thing to worry about

180
00:23:01,743 --> 00:23:03,814
l don't want you to worry about anything

181
00:23:03,979 --> 00:23:06,250
What else you want
me to do to relieve you?

182
00:23:06,548 --> 00:23:09,154
- Since it makes you so happy
- You're serious?

183
00:23:09,285 --> 00:23:11,656
Yeah l'm serious

184
00:23:11,753 --> 00:23:17,733
Can you be used to have dinner
alone? l mean in case l'm late

185
00:23:17,894 --> 00:23:22,035
- But you're not late, today
- Generally

186
00:23:22,198 --> 00:23:27,174
What is it, Yussef? You don't want me
to wait for you and have dinner together?

187
00:23:27,637 --> 00:23:30,809
l don't want you
to wait for me at all

188
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,816
What are you saying Yussef?
What happened?

189
00:23:47,424 --> 00:23:50,530
What's wrong Yussef?

190
00:23:53,296 --> 00:23:56,302
Tell me Yussef, what's wrong?

191
00:23:56,433 --> 00:23:59,238
l love you so much, Hind

192
00:24:00,738 --> 00:24:03,142
What's wrong Yussef?

193
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:09,852
Nothing at all honey, l must
go to France on a business trip

194
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,652
and l'll miss you so much, that's all

195
00:24:12,783 --> 00:24:17,659
- What's making you so sad?
- l'm okay

196
00:24:19,657 --> 00:24:24,266
You're sure it's just
this trip that's bothering you

197
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:33,010
Yeah l swear but l'd like you
to get used to some things...

198
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:40,718
l might not be able to do
with you due to this trip abroad

199
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,222
What changed now, Yussef?
You've never kept anything from me

200
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:49,156
You've never kept me away from you

201
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:53,162
Forgive me Hind,
l know l'm being unfair with you

202
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:57,466
- But it's against my will
- l'd forgive you anything

203
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,001
Unless you stop loving me

204
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:03,071
l've never needed you as much as today

205
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:08,044
but l can't let you,
Ramy and dad su_er with me

206
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:11,413
l'd rather su_er all alone

207
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,849
Why are you still awake?

208
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:17,419
- Go back to sleep
- l don't wanna sleep

209
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:19,186
l want daddy to
tell me a bed time story

210
00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:24,229
You're not a small kid anymore,
l said go back to sleep

211
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:27,694
Ramy

212
00:25:34,134 --> 00:25:37,306
l asked the nurse to give
me a sleeping pill but she forgot

213
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:40,944
No she didn't,
l didn't let her give you any

214
00:25:41,108 --> 00:25:44,314
coz you can't take any sleeping
bills with the treatment you're having

215
00:25:44,444 --> 00:25:46,715
But l can't get any sleep

216
00:25:46,814 --> 00:25:52,257
Then try not to think, listen
to some music or read a book

217
00:25:53,587 --> 00:25:56,592
- Or you know what? Take this
- What's this?

218
00:25:56,757 --> 00:25:59,629
lt's the key to my o_ice,
l'll be leaving soon

219
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:01,530
You go in and find
yourselfa book to read

220
00:26:01,695 --> 00:26:04,567
There is a bookshelf full of CDs,
you may choose the one you like

221
00:26:04,698 --> 00:26:08,005
No, Dr. l'm not that desperate,
l'll try to go to sleep

222
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:10,806
No need to be shy, there you go

223
00:26:10,905 --> 00:26:12,540
First, l don't keep
secrets inside my o_ice

224
00:26:12,706 --> 00:26:14,576
second, if l were you

225
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:17,881
l'd feel bad too,
just sitting in bed doing nothing

226
00:28:40,926 --> 00:28:44,265
Daddy, daddy,
go on tell me the story

227
00:28:46,364 --> 00:28:52,075
l've already told you one,
Ramy, why are you still awake?

228
00:28:52,204 --> 00:28:56,880
Tell me another one,
tell me the sailor's story

229
00:28:57,042 --> 00:28:58,945
The sailor?

230
00:29:00,111 --> 00:29:03,986
- Ramy, can l ask you a favor?
- Yes you can

231
00:29:04,116 --> 00:29:08,892
Your father is a bit tired now,
can l tell you this story some other time?

232
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:15,735
Yes but on one condition, you must
promise me to tell me this story tomorrow

233
00:29:17,831 --> 00:29:20,035
Tomorrow?

234
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:30,014
l'll tell you the story today, right now

235
00:29:30,276 --> 00:29:36,889
Once upon a time, there were a small
sailor and he was as brave as you are

236
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:41,592
he was in love with a beautiful
girl and he wanted to marry her

237
00:29:41,954 --> 00:29:44,293
she wanted that too

238
00:29:44,424 --> 00:29:48,465
but she asked him
a very strange favor

239
00:29:48,528 --> 00:29:54,373
she wanted him to
bring her a big shiny pearl

240
00:29:54,534 --> 00:29:59,010
but this pearl can
only be found in the sea

241
00:30:02,976 --> 00:30:06,183
the sailor got on his boat

242
00:30:06,914 --> 00:30:09,953
not knowing where to go

243
00:30:10,117 --> 00:30:15,194
nor how to get the white
pearl for his beloved girl

244
00:30:25,901 --> 00:30:30,075
Come on Yussef, Ramy's
home and lunch is ready

245
00:30:30,605 --> 00:30:35,549
Yussef, Yussef, lunch is ready

246
00:31:05,474 --> 00:31:08,948
- l don't get it
- Come here

247
00:32:20,184 --> 00:32:22,421
The minute l decided
to make this tape

248
00:32:22,654 --> 00:32:26,227
is the minute
l decided to settle everything

249
00:32:27,158 --> 00:32:32,034
to tell you the truth Hind,
l was reluctant

250
00:32:34,332 --> 00:32:39,776
should l spend the rest of my
days or my last months with you

251
00:32:39,871 --> 00:32:42,009
to get enough of you

252
00:32:43,275 --> 00:32:47,951
or should l stop being so selfish
and make you su_er with me?

253
00:32:48,113 --> 00:32:51,252
l'd rather stay away
and su_er all by myself

254
00:33:06,365 --> 00:33:09,137
this is better

255
00:33:10,069 --> 00:33:13,876
you must get used
to do things without me

256
00:33:17,577 --> 00:33:21,251
and l'd be sure
you're okay before l...

257
00:33:25,351 --> 00:33:31,062
l'd be sure you can rely on
yourself and face life without me

258
00:33:32,659 --> 00:33:35,798
l'm sure you're up to it, Hind

259
00:33:36,329 --> 00:33:38,701
l'm totally relieved now

260
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,973
and l found a way to be
with you, via my voice at least

261
00:33:43,136 --> 00:33:46,376
l'll make a recorded tape for every
special occasion you'll ever face

262
00:33:47,508 --> 00:33:53,786
congratulations Ramy, today
we're happier than any other day

263
00:33:54,115 --> 00:34:00,126
you graduated from college, and
l sure hope you studied Interior Design

264
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:01,689
those sketches you
used to draw as a small kid

265
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:05,262
proved to me you'll make
a great interior designer

266
00:34:09,497 --> 00:34:12,268
much better than l was

267
00:34:13,435 --> 00:34:17,041
you're a grown up man, now

268
00:34:17,237 --> 00:34:21,246
you must choose your
own path and succeed

269
00:34:21,376 --> 00:34:24,047
and make your mom happy

270
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:30,825
all she's got left is you, you're
the only hope she's got in this life

271
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:38,162
l missed you so, Ramy

272
00:34:39,895 --> 00:34:43,669
could you be missing me too?

273
00:35:21,938 --> 00:35:23,608
We went to extraordinary lengths
to convince the management board

274
00:35:23,673 --> 00:35:26,244
to change the conventional
treatment used in this hospital

275
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:30,951
They're convinced that such
treatment is as e_icient as drugs

276
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,616
and l managed
gradually to convince them

277
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:34,786
and the hospital became
what you can see now

278
00:35:34,951 --> 00:35:36,921
So it's true that the general
environment surrounding the patient

279
00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:38,222
and his psychological state

280
00:35:38,321 --> 00:35:40,325
can have an e_ect on
the disease and its treatment?

281
00:35:40,624 --> 00:35:41,625
Of course

282
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:45,231
A person's immune
system is like the army

283
00:35:45,295 --> 00:35:49,804
if the army's morals are high, he can
win no matter how strong the enemy

284
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,941
and if the morals are low,
he will loose before even fighting

285
00:35:54,071 --> 00:35:55,039
Nice speech

286
00:35:55,139 --> 00:35:56,775
lt's notjust a speech, Shams, it's a science

287
00:35:56,974 --> 00:35:59,044
l based my magistrate's
thesis on this subject

288
00:35:59,143 --> 00:36:02,750
and l was inspired by
a simple peasant in my country

289
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,587
He was a cancer patient and received
treatment in my dad's health resort

290
00:36:06,751 --> 00:36:08,654
You must get some rest

291
00:36:08,753 --> 00:36:13,195
You prescribe my medicine,
and leave work to me

292
00:36:13,324 --> 00:36:15,795
- What do you mean?
- You must get some rest, l'm telling you

293
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,167
- And if l don't rest, will l die?
- That's very probable, son

294
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:22,103
lf l leave my land, and stop
working as hard as l used to

295
00:36:22,267 --> 00:36:23,937
l'll starve with my children

296
00:36:24,035 --> 00:36:25,103
l'm gonna take care of my land

297
00:36:25,236 --> 00:36:28,141
at least until my kids grow up
and assume that responsibility

298
00:36:28,306 --> 00:36:31,145
- You might not have the time
- l put my trust in the Lord, doc.

299
00:36:31,209 --> 00:36:33,881
He won't let our land perish

300
00:36:34,112 --> 00:36:37,786
Strange enough,
that man is still alive till today

301
00:36:37,982 --> 00:36:39,853
as opposed to all the medical facts

302
00:36:39,951 --> 00:36:42,623
The only explanation for that
is that the love he had his land

303
00:36:42,821 --> 00:36:45,793
and the psychological welfare dad
provided him inside the health resort

304
00:36:45,924 --> 00:36:49,498
stimulated his immune system
and helped him fight his disease

305
00:36:50,062 --> 00:36:53,034
Few believe in this theory here

306
00:36:53,165 --> 00:36:56,771
but it's been confirmed abroad and
they even encourage group therapy

307
00:36:56,902 --> 00:36:59,775
So those who su_er from the same
disease should be treated together?

308
00:36:59,905 --> 00:37:03,379
Yeah, each one can talk about
his disease and how to resist it

309
00:37:03,475 --> 00:37:07,349
Thus they don't have
to face their disease all alone

310
00:37:07,479 --> 00:37:11,286
The more similar the cases are,
the better the treatment is

311
00:37:11,484 --> 00:37:13,788
There are actually people
su_ering from the same degree?

312
00:37:13,853 --> 00:37:18,362
lt's very rare, but there happened to be a
similar case to yours, he's a young man

313
00:37:18,524 --> 00:37:21,497
- An architect from Hurghada
- Yussef El Ady

314
00:37:21,794 --> 00:37:25,168
- You know him?
- No, but l found his file on your desk

315
00:37:25,332 --> 00:37:27,002
of course, l wasn't trying to poke
my nose into other people's business

316
00:37:27,067 --> 00:37:29,972
- But the file fell...
- That's not the problem

317
00:37:30,137 --> 00:37:32,074
as soon as he got
diagnosed with leukemia

318
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:34,844
he left and never came
back nor even called me

319
00:37:34,941 --> 00:37:38,716
- Maybe he went to see another doctor
- l don't think so

320
00:37:38,879 --> 00:37:42,485
l guess he's just like you, he'll give me
a hard time until he agrees to get a treatment

321
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:56,100
lbrahim, you're the only one
l can entrust with these tapes

322
00:37:56,164 --> 00:37:58,902
- l want you to give them to Hind when l...
- What the hell is this nonsense, Yussef?

323
00:37:59,066 --> 00:38:01,704
Who gave you the right
to consider yourself doomed?

324
00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:04,374
we still don't know how much
will you respond to treatment

325
00:38:04,638 --> 00:38:06,274
Yussef

326
00:38:10,211 --> 00:38:12,983
l know it's a very tough situation
and it's very di_icult to bear

327
00:38:13,047 --> 00:38:15,685
but believe me, you're making
a big mistake by giving up to despair

328
00:38:15,817 --> 00:38:18,956
it'll make the next few
days pretty unbearable

329
00:38:20,087 --> 00:38:22,660
That's why l wanna
live them all by myself

330
00:38:22,824 --> 00:38:25,261
lt's okay, help me

331
00:38:25,394 --> 00:38:29,167
But what you're asking
is horrible and inhuman

332
00:38:29,331 --> 00:38:31,668
- Inhuman?
- Of course Yussef

333
00:38:31,766 --> 00:38:34,671
God forbid you die,
you know what those tapes mean

334
00:38:34,803 --> 00:38:35,871
You're gonna make your family
prisoners to your voice in these tapes

335
00:38:36,038 --> 00:38:37,006
for the rest of their lives

336
00:38:37,105 --> 00:38:39,410
They're gonna with
the ghost of your memory forever

337
00:38:39,774 --> 00:38:40,977
l didn't mean it this way

338
00:38:41,043 --> 00:38:43,113
l wanna help them live with me

339
00:38:43,278 --> 00:38:44,914
You're just scared you won't
get the chance to live with them

340
00:38:45,047 --> 00:38:46,884
Unwillingly, you're just
making them live with you

341
00:38:47,015 --> 00:38:50,723
This is total selfishness,
you'd never let them lead a normal life

342
00:38:50,886 --> 00:38:54,259
- Believe me, l didn't mean to do that
- l'm pretty sure

343
00:38:54,323 --> 00:38:59,332
and l won't ask you to burn
these tapes, keep them with you

344
00:38:59,495 --> 00:39:01,866
l'm pretty sure you'll
be back safe and sound

345
00:39:01,997 --> 00:39:04,802
and you'll burn them yourself

346
00:39:07,903 --> 00:39:11,810
- l want a ticket from Cairo to Paris
- But there is a direct flight from here to Paris

347
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,310
No, that's just the way l want it

348
00:39:13,376 --> 00:39:15,713
You want another
ticket from here to Cairo?

349
00:39:15,911 --> 00:39:18,783
No, l'll go to Cairo by car

350
00:39:23,086 --> 00:39:25,958
How couldn't you find
a trip from Hurghada to Cairo?

351
00:39:26,122 --> 00:39:30,163
They booked the flight, they said
all the tickets to Cairo are sold out

352
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,232
Don't you bother
to come with me to Egypt

353
00:39:33,396 --> 00:39:38,306
Yussef, l'm coming with you and
nothing will make me change my mind

354
00:39:43,774 --> 00:39:48,250
Darling, there is no need to come with
me and leave dad and Ramy by themselves

355
00:39:48,379 --> 00:39:50,316
You can bid me farewell here,
it's just the same

356
00:39:50,647 --> 00:39:52,384
No

357
00:40:39,164 --> 00:40:41,101
Come on

358
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:46,176
ls it so hard to live
without me forjust a month?

359
00:40:49,107 --> 00:40:51,077
You...

360
00:40:53,379 --> 00:40:56,818
You're the strongest woman ever

361
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:01,090
What if dad and
Ramy saw you like this?

362
00:41:01,187 --> 00:41:03,457
What will they do then?

363
00:41:07,526 --> 00:41:12,135
l don't even want you to
come with me to the airport

364
00:41:12,298 --> 00:41:15,938
You don't want me to go to
the airport nor pack up your bags

365
00:41:16,102 --> 00:41:17,905
You don't even want me
by your side any more

366
00:41:18,071 --> 00:41:19,974
l'm gonna lose my mind and
l don't understand what's going on

367
00:41:20,073 --> 00:41:22,343
Why are you doing this to me?

368
00:41:23,543 --> 00:41:31,090
l just want you to take care
of yourself, of Ramy and dad

369
00:41:32,652 --> 00:41:37,963
you're the man of this
house until l come back

370
00:41:38,092 --> 00:41:40,864
but you're a very beautiful one

371
00:41:42,396 --> 00:41:49,076
and you're even more beautiful
when you wipe away your tears

372
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:30,978
lt's okay Ramy,
l wanted to stay by your side

373
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:36,016
but l don't want you
to see me tumbling down

374
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:43,791
l want you to remember
me the best way ever

375
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:48,026
l'll miss you so, sweetie

376
00:44:52,324 --> 00:44:54,261
Yussef

377
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:10,115
- You still don't want me to come with you?
- It's okay darling

378
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,881
lt's much better this way

379
00:45:17,884 --> 00:45:19,519
Come here

380
00:45:28,862 --> 00:45:32,034
- Go get my bag from inside
- Okay

381
00:45:32,999 --> 00:45:35,671
Excuse me Ma'am, Ma'am

382
00:45:35,769 --> 00:45:39,977
Ma'am excuse me,
l'll get in to bring the bag

383
00:46:21,616 --> 00:46:23,186
Dr. Hisham and l went to
the faculty of medicine together

384
00:46:23,318 --> 00:46:23,318
he's the best cancer
specialist in Egypt

385
00:46:26,188 --> 00:46:30,162
l talked to him, he's pretty excited to see
you and he has very high expectations

386
00:46:30,225 --> 00:46:34,667
lbrahim, l gave a good
thought of what you told me

387
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:38,871
and l'll do what you
told me to, thank you

388
00:47:00,924 --> 00:47:04,831
- We'll get to the airport in 10 minutes
- l'm not going to the airport

389
00:47:04,928 --> 00:47:08,034
- Where to, if l may ask sir
- Go to Menyal

390
00:47:08,998 --> 00:47:10,701
Straight to Menyal and
then to the airport, right?

391
00:47:10,834 --> 00:47:14,675
- No, just to Menyal
- Whatever you say sir

392
00:47:16,405 --> 00:47:18,476
Go left

393
00:47:19,843 --> 00:47:21,813
Stop here

394
00:47:27,851 --> 00:47:31,491
Farhat for real-state,
apartments, oMces, villas

395
00:47:31,654 --> 00:47:35,863
Sir l can't leave you here, you've helped
me a lot when we were at college together

396
00:47:35,993 --> 00:47:38,564
and this house doesn't suit you

397
00:47:38,695 --> 00:47:43,171
Why didn't you tell me you're coming?
l would have gotten you a much better place

398
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:46,205
This place is just fine,
Farhat, it's enough for me

399
00:47:46,503 --> 00:47:48,574
Anyway, this is a very
quiet building for families

400
00:47:48,672 --> 00:47:51,244
this flat has always received
decent and good persons

401
00:47:51,575 --> 00:47:53,680
and if you wanna change it,
just let me know

402
00:47:53,811 --> 00:47:55,748
- Would you like anything else?
- Thank you Farhat

403
00:47:55,846 --> 00:47:58,484
- See you later
- Goodbye

404
00:48:13,331 --> 00:48:14,901
How are you doing,
you ill-mannered man?

405
00:48:15,033 --> 00:48:17,303
Why aren't you answering your phone
Medhat? l've been calling you for days

406
00:48:17,435 --> 00:48:20,374
- Wrong number
- You're angry coz l didn't stay that night

407
00:48:20,672 --> 00:48:22,074
When did you come back?

408
00:48:22,173 --> 00:48:25,947
l told you, it's the
wrong number, excuse me

409
00:48:33,251 --> 00:48:36,156
- Hello!
- You forgot about me, Medhat?

410
00:48:36,322 --> 00:48:38,426
This person you're
talking to isn't available

411
00:48:38,557 --> 00:48:40,894
- He left this flat
- The hell with him

412
00:48:41,026 --> 00:48:42,329
he and his pals were
just some poor buggers

413
00:48:42,428 --> 00:48:46,035
but you seem like a nice guy

414
00:49:13,226 --> 00:49:17,167
l forgive you coz the first thing you did
all by yourself was to put on your pajamas

415
00:49:17,364 --> 00:49:21,271
but l won't forgive you
if you don't call me right away

416
00:49:21,368 --> 00:49:24,373
l'd like to make sure you're okay

417
00:49:32,545 --> 00:49:37,054
Wait, l'm still awake,
l wanna hear another story

418
00:49:37,217 --> 00:49:41,325
ls that so? You tried
to fool me? Very well

419
00:49:41,755 --> 00:49:44,694
Once upon a time, there were
a brave man called Hassan

420
00:49:44,825 --> 00:49:48,999
- No, l wanna hear the sailor's story
- Very well

421
00:49:49,096 --> 00:49:53,638
Once upon a time, there were a sailor,
who was as handsome and brave as you are

422
00:49:53,767 --> 00:49:56,672
he was in love with a beautiful
girl and wanted to marry her

423
00:50:01,075 --> 00:50:04,281
- Dr. Hisham is down in the garden
- Thank you Safaa

424
00:50:04,478 --> 00:50:08,485
Miss Shams,
can l have a word with you?

425
00:50:12,253 --> 00:50:15,693
What do you think of this present?

426
00:50:16,323 --> 00:50:19,831
lt's nice, but didn't you
get him a present last week?

427
00:50:19,928 --> 00:50:24,002
You mean that fiancé? No, l broke
up with him, it's for my second fiancé

428
00:50:24,132 --> 00:50:26,937
You have a di_erent
fiancé every week?

429
00:50:27,101 --> 00:50:28,204
What should l do, Miss Shams?

430
00:50:28,336 --> 00:50:31,943
Each time l tighten my
grip on one, he runs away

431
00:50:32,074 --> 00:50:35,113
Oh well... l guess
they don't deserve you

432
00:50:46,421 --> 00:50:48,291
You doctors keep
moaning about working hard

433
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:51,797
there you are, basking in
the sun reading your newspaper

434
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:56,770
Frankly, l'd rather stop reading them,
they make me fell down in the dumps

435
00:50:56,932 --> 00:51:00,205
- Hello
- Good morning doctor, l'm Yussef El Ady

436
00:51:00,336 --> 00:51:03,275
- Yussef El Ady from Hurghada?
- Yes

437
00:51:03,406 --> 00:51:06,712
- Where have you been, man?
- l'm here in Egypt

438
00:51:06,842 --> 00:51:09,447
ln Egypt? That's great

439
00:51:09,778 --> 00:51:13,286
- May l ask you a question, Dr.?
- May l ask you a favor?

440
00:51:13,349 --> 00:51:14,317
Of course

441
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:16,720
Can you come here and ask
me your question so we can meet

442
00:51:16,886 --> 00:51:18,790
or don't you want us
to get to know each other?

443
00:51:18,922 --> 00:51:20,257
Not at all, Dr.

444
00:51:20,423 --> 00:51:23,162
l just wanted you to
prescribe me a painkiller

445
00:51:23,259 --> 00:51:26,098
Sorry to ask you on
the phone, it's just that...

446
00:51:26,229 --> 00:51:29,936
lt's just what, man?
Are you that stingy? l'll buy you tea

447
00:51:30,033 --> 00:51:31,001
lf you wanna buy
me one in return, fine

448
00:51:31,134 --> 00:51:33,472
- If not, that's okay
- Well doctor, it's just that...

449
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:36,174
lt's just what?
What are you saying?

450
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:41,883
Look, there is a gorgeous
woman here who wanna talk to you

451
00:51:42,113 --> 00:51:43,715
Without good morning or anything

452
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,452
My name is Shams and you
know me, l won't tell you how

453
00:51:46,717 --> 00:51:49,189
We're waiting for you to...

454
00:51:49,353 --> 00:51:51,290
To tell you lots of things,
once you get here

455
00:51:51,388 --> 00:51:52,423
l don't understand

456
00:51:52,757 --> 00:51:53,892
You'll understand
everything once you get here

457
00:51:54,025 --> 00:51:55,427
You got changed and
you're on your way here, right?

458
00:51:55,526 --> 00:51:58,431
We're waiting for you, goodbye

459
00:52:09,307 --> 00:52:12,913
What have you done?
You hung up on him, he might get mad

460
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:14,980
He won't get mad
and he will come here

461
00:52:15,113 --> 00:52:18,953
- My voice is irresistible, you wanna bet?
- We'll see

462
00:52:19,117 --> 00:52:23,158
He'll come and l'll convince him
to get treated and l'll win the bet

463
00:52:39,538 --> 00:52:42,209
You can't imagine
how much hope you have

464
00:52:42,374 --> 00:52:44,277
Come on in

465
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:46,112
- Good morning
- Good morning

466
00:52:46,245 --> 00:52:48,515
Where did you get?
He still don't wanna talk

467
00:52:48,814 --> 00:52:50,584
l'm at the end of my tether, Shams

468
00:52:50,849 --> 00:52:53,054
This is Shams,
she's determined to talk to you

469
00:52:53,219 --> 00:52:56,425
l sure wanna talk to him to
give him the chance of a lifetime

470
00:52:56,555 --> 00:52:57,925
l knew you're a talented architect

471
00:52:58,057 --> 00:53:00,896
and l chose you to handle the
interior design of my ballet school

472
00:53:01,027 --> 00:53:02,562
The one l will build,
twenty years from now

473
00:53:02,862 --> 00:53:04,264
l'd better leave you two alone

474
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:06,100
No doctor, we don't
wanna waste your time

475
00:53:06,165 --> 00:53:08,469
we'll go sit somewhere
suitable for a fight

476
00:53:08,601 --> 00:53:10,438
over the school's designs

477
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:12,139
l wanna discuss your fees too

478
00:53:12,271 --> 00:53:17,548
but don't you think you can take advantage
of me and make me pay an exorbitant price

479
00:53:19,412 --> 00:53:21,950
This is my story

480
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:24,553
The one dream
l'd like to make it come true

481
00:53:24,818 --> 00:53:28,225
ls to play with the Bolshoi
band when they arrive to Egypt

482
00:53:28,355 --> 00:53:33,131
l'm the only Egyptian ballerina
they chose to perform with them

483
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:34,795
This is indeed a trivial
dream compared to your dream

484
00:53:34,928 --> 00:53:37,199
of getting back to your wife and kid

485
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,967
No dream is trivial, Shams

486
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:44,777
- But some dreams are impossible
- Who decides? You? Me?

487
00:53:44,905 --> 00:53:46,975
Maybe it's a slight one
but there's always hope

488
00:53:47,074 --> 00:53:49,813
That's why Dr. Hisham
Ieft us to talk together

489
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:52,381
and he's hoping l can convince you

490
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,321
- The prescription...
- These are all sedatives, he told you so

491
00:53:56,484 --> 00:53:58,821
Why don't you wanna make the
necessary treatment? l don't get it

492
00:53:58,919 --> 00:54:01,391
You just like to
be stubborn about it?

493
00:54:01,622 --> 00:54:06,264
How much did you improve since
you started receiving chemotherapy?

494
00:54:06,594 --> 00:54:10,970
l feel l'm getting better although the medical
tests haven't shown any improvement

495
00:54:11,132 --> 00:54:14,839
Your hair ain't falling out?

496
00:54:15,336 --> 00:54:19,812
Dr. Hisham said that the
hair doesn't necessary fall out

497
00:54:19,941 --> 00:54:21,476
l'm sorry, l didn't mean to

498
00:54:21,777 --> 00:54:25,718
- l don't wanna have high hopes
- Let us both have hopes

499
00:54:25,847 --> 00:54:28,953
You'll just have to follow me, okay?

500
00:54:29,851 --> 00:54:33,090
- Okay
- Then we have a deal

501
00:54:33,221 --> 00:54:34,991
l'll give you my phone number

502
00:54:35,123 --> 00:54:37,060
ln case you wanted to talk to me

503
00:54:37,193 --> 00:54:41,167
You can give me your
phone number and address

504
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:48,041
ln case l wanted to check on you

505
00:54:49,038 --> 00:54:53,379
Give it to me quick,
l'll write down something else

506
00:54:53,508 --> 00:54:55,212
l'll write down the date
of performing the Jezel ballet

507
00:54:55,344 --> 00:54:58,751
That's the one time the Bolshoi
band will perform in Egypt

508
00:54:58,915 --> 00:55:01,286
What? l have the right
to hold on to my dream

509
00:55:01,383 --> 00:55:07,161
- And you're gonna watch it too
- Who knows? Although l'm not a ballet fan

510
00:56:44,289 --> 00:56:48,196
l know you're busy but
l miss you and l can't help it

511
00:56:48,494 --> 00:56:49,929
why don't you give me a call?

512
00:56:50,062 --> 00:56:52,032
you'll say l'm boring, it's fine by me

513
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:55,905
but l would like to hear your voice

514
00:57:03,476 --> 00:57:06,415
What is this beautiful girl thinking of?

515
00:57:06,512 --> 00:57:08,716
- It's nothing, dad
- Yes it is

516
00:57:11,684 --> 00:57:14,122
What's wrong Hind?

517
00:57:20,293 --> 00:57:23,432
l'm very mad at Yussef

518
00:57:24,163 --> 00:57:26,702
l can't believe he still hasn't
called us after all this time

519
00:57:26,867 --> 00:57:29,973
We don't know his circumstances

520
00:57:30,737 --> 00:57:33,442
l'm worried sick about him

521
00:57:35,242 --> 00:57:37,946
This whole trip
has been pretty strange

522
00:57:38,112 --> 00:57:40,483
ls it possible he don't even
know where he'll be staying?

523
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:42,818
l called his o_ice and they
can't even give me his phone number

524
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:47,425
They said they'll ask the company's
headquarter in Egypt and will call you later

525
00:57:47,687 --> 00:57:52,765
When will that be? They've been telling
us the same thing for the whole week

526
00:58:23,158 --> 00:58:27,266
He's still not answering the phone,
l guess we must go check on him

527
00:58:28,363 --> 00:58:31,335
Maybe he's hurt or something?

528
00:58:31,767 --> 00:58:35,006
l would like to know what
is really going on with you

529
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:38,878
You're much more concerned
about Yussef than l am

530
00:58:39,007 --> 00:58:42,748
lt's my fault that l'm
concerned about your patient?

531
00:58:42,878 --> 00:58:44,748
And that's just it?

532
00:58:47,616 --> 00:58:49,820
Of course not

533
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:55,964
l have high hopes of helping him get
better and go back to his wife and kid

534
00:58:57,259 --> 00:59:00,299
Yussef is still too young to die

535
00:59:09,639 --> 00:59:11,709
Yes l'm coming

536
00:59:16,779 --> 00:59:18,583
_es

537
00:59:22,452 --> 00:59:25,858
Excuse me sir,
it seems l woke you up

538
00:59:26,056 --> 00:59:31,934
- What is it Ma'am?
- l live downstairs and l need your help

539
00:59:34,098 --> 00:59:37,237
Come here son, stay with
him for a couple of minutes

540
00:59:37,367 --> 00:59:40,974
until l go get a doctor
from a health resort nearby

541
00:59:41,171 --> 00:59:44,711
Each time l call them,
the nurse says help is on its way

542
00:59:44,842 --> 00:59:47,313
- You live alone here?
- No son

543
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:48,379
My daughter and
her husband live here too

544
00:59:48,713 --> 00:59:52,119
but they went to Alexandria yesterday
to celebrate their son's engagement party

545
00:59:52,282 --> 00:59:56,724
l beg you, change his
compresses until l go get the doctor

546
00:59:56,854 --> 00:59:58,757
No, you stay with him,
l'll go get the doctor myself

547
00:59:58,889 --> 00:59:59,991
l don't wanna bother you, son

548
01:00:00,158 --> 01:00:05,234
- It's cold outside and it'll start raining soon
- No, you'd better stay with him

549
01:00:49,641 --> 01:00:51,644
- Thank you doctor
- You're welcome

550
01:00:51,744 --> 01:00:55,117
Don't forget the
compresses, good night

551
01:00:59,819 --> 01:01:02,123
- Thank you doctor
- Good night

552
01:01:02,188 --> 01:01:04,125
lf you need anything
Ma'am, l'll be upstairs

553
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:06,261
God bless you and
keep you safe and sound

554
01:01:06,392 --> 01:01:08,997
- Good night
- You too

555
01:01:13,999 --> 01:01:18,676
- Why is your place turned upside down?
- Sorry

556
01:01:20,974 --> 01:01:23,111
Have a seat

557
01:01:28,448 --> 01:01:30,953
Can l know why is your phone unplugged?

558
01:01:31,084 --> 01:01:32,821
Some people were bothering me

559
01:01:32,919 --> 01:01:35,792
lf someone wants to get hold of you,
he'd have to come to this cave?

560
01:01:35,956 --> 01:01:38,795
- Who'd wanna call me?
- You really are an ill-mannered man

561
01:01:38,892 --> 01:01:42,332
- Me? Dr. Hisham?
- What do you like to drink?

562
01:01:42,463 --> 01:01:46,170
l don't wanna drink anything,
go get changed and come with me

563
01:01:46,334 --> 01:01:48,404
- Where to?
- l'm not kidnapping you, don't worry

564
01:01:48,502 --> 01:01:51,241
l just wanna have a word
with you, l'll wait for you in my car

565
01:01:51,372 --> 01:01:54,311
No, you'll catch a cold,
l've already been out and it's very cold

566
01:01:54,475 --> 01:01:56,345
- You don't wanna come with me?
- No

567
01:01:56,443 --> 01:01:59,183
l just don't want you
to stay down there all alone

568
01:01:59,347 --> 01:02:02,052
Go get changed then

569
01:02:34,549 --> 01:02:38,189
Yussef, just shave but don't take
a shower coz it's pretty cold outside

570
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:40,992
What could happen to me?
l'd catch a cold?

571
01:02:41,123 --> 01:02:46,399
You're right but you've already
got enough to worry about

572
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:52,603
- Yussef
- Yeah?

573
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:54,906
- This is the picture of your wife and kid?
- Yeah

574
01:02:55,103 --> 01:02:57,642
- They're both very beautiful
- Thank you

575
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:00,178
You really are a coldhearted man

576
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:03,649
Anybody else would be exhilarated
to live with them in any another life

577
01:03:03,779 --> 01:03:08,755
Give me another life
and it'll be my pleasure

578
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:17,762
l'm ready

579
01:03:18,829 --> 01:03:21,935
Now you're fit to get out with
the first ballerina in all of Egypt

580
01:03:22,065 --> 01:03:23,668
You're really swept o_
your feet by this ballet thing

581
01:03:23,834 --> 01:03:26,271
- Can't you think of anything else?
- Of course l can't

582
01:03:26,337 --> 01:03:32,047
l have a goal, a dream not like you,
as if you're living on another planet

583
01:03:32,243 --> 01:03:33,712
l'm starting to have my doubts

584
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:37,617
- Are you really ill, Shams?
- Maybe more than you are

585
01:03:37,748 --> 01:03:44,027
but the di_erence is that l've decided
to beat this disease not let it beat me

586
01:03:44,188 --> 01:03:49,364
and l'd like you to fight this war
with me, so we can win it together

587
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:54,169
- Why me?
- l don't know

588
01:03:54,331 --> 01:04:00,877
l've never met you before but
l'm very happy when l see you

589
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:07,112
Shall we go?

590
01:04:07,379 --> 01:04:11,553
- You dried your hair?
- Like l already said, it's only a cold

591
01:04:11,649 --> 01:04:15,323
Yussef, don't forget
to water this plant

592
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:22,033
lt's very easy to make
it grow and even easier to let it die

593
01:04:33,071 --> 01:04:38,047
All of a sudden, you forgot your pain and
wanted to just run fast and get the doctor?

594
01:04:38,677 --> 01:04:40,547
Exactly Shams

595
01:04:40,846 --> 01:04:42,382
lt's really ambiguous

596
01:04:42,515 --> 01:04:44,185
l felt so strong each time l
Iooked at that boy and imagined he...

597
01:04:44,517 --> 01:04:46,721
lmagined he could be Ramy?

598
01:04:46,985 --> 01:04:48,955
Ramy has his mom and
grandpa to take care of him

599
01:04:49,088 --> 01:04:50,690
but this boy's parents weren't there

600
01:04:50,823 --> 01:04:56,802
When Ramy's mom and his grandpa
need your help, who will be there for them?

601
01:04:58,664 --> 01:05:02,238
Look Yussef, what you
told me has just one meaning

602
01:05:02,535 --> 01:05:04,640
lt means that Dr. Hisham is right

603
01:05:04,771 --> 01:05:06,841
We have a great deal of will inside

604
01:05:06,973 --> 01:05:13,653
lf we find it, we can de_ anything
at all and make all our dreams come true

605
01:05:14,548 --> 01:05:16,551
The ballet has been
your only dream in this life?

606
01:05:16,683 --> 01:05:20,022
Of course not, l had
other dreams that came true

607
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:22,790
And some others
that didn't come true

608
01:05:22,922 --> 01:05:25,160
Which one of your
dreams didn't come true?

609
01:05:25,292 --> 01:05:28,331
lt's a silly dream but
which all girls hold very dear

610
01:05:28,628 --> 01:05:29,730
The white horse

611
01:05:29,864 --> 01:05:33,136
lt doesn't have to be
a horse nor a white one

612
01:05:33,266 --> 01:05:36,239
l was 4 years old when
l started studying ballet

613
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:39,643
l used to walk on this bridge
every day on my way to the gym

614
01:05:39,773 --> 01:05:42,880
When l grew older, just like other girls

615
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:45,882
l dreamed of walking
this bridge with the man l love

616
01:05:46,013 --> 01:05:47,215
l'd feel warm although
it's freezing cold

617
01:05:47,347 --> 01:05:51,254
Suddenly, it's raining and
we're running but we don't know why

618
01:05:51,386 --> 01:05:55,761
ls it to get a shelter from rain
or to embrace it with both arms?

619
01:05:57,225 --> 01:05:59,027
What?

620
01:05:59,727 --> 01:06:03,167
- You think l'm a fool?
- No, not at all, just a bit crazy

621
01:06:03,297 --> 01:06:05,702
Since l'm crazy,
l can ask you whatever l want

622
01:06:05,833 --> 01:06:06,801
Be my guest

623
01:06:06,935 --> 01:06:10,909
What dream you had and regretted
afterwards it was only a dream?

624
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:12,341
l don't get it

625
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:16,648
What dream you want
it to come true right now?

626
01:06:16,778 --> 01:06:21,286
To walk with a gorgeous girl here
at this bridge when it's freezing cold

627
01:06:21,416 --> 01:06:24,088
- In your dream, there was no rain?
- No

628
01:06:24,218 --> 01:06:27,224
Are you sure? Try to remember

629
01:06:28,624 --> 01:06:33,065
Although you're dull and gloomy
and although l'm not that gorgeous

630
01:06:33,195 --> 01:06:35,999
What do you say
l share your dream right now?

631
01:06:36,132 --> 01:06:38,971
- But in your dream, it was raining
- It doesn't matter

632
01:06:39,101 --> 01:06:39,101
One dream is enough,
give me your hand

633
01:06:41,637 --> 01:06:42,372
One dream is enough,
give me your hand

634
01:07:18,808 --> 01:07:21,647
- Good night
- Good night

635
01:07:21,778 --> 01:07:24,016
l'll start the treatment
with you tomorrow

636
01:07:24,147 --> 01:07:27,687
Really? Thank you so much

637
01:07:28,051 --> 01:07:30,255
l guess l'm the one
who should be saying that

638
01:07:30,386 --> 01:07:32,424
Yussef, take this

639
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:36,829
l used to wear it in Russia
when it's freezing cold

640
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,732
- You went to Russia?
- l've been all around the world

641
01:07:39,863 --> 01:07:42,435
l'll tell you all about it
tomorrow, take these too

642
01:07:42,733 --> 01:07:46,373
- What are these?
- The soundtrack of Giselle and its novel

643
01:07:47,738 --> 01:07:50,243
What is it? l'm telling
you about my next dream

644
01:07:50,374 --> 01:07:52,845
Who knows? It might
come true like this one

645
01:07:53,344 --> 01:07:56,951
You know what?
Forget it, you hate ballet

646
01:07:59,017 --> 01:08:02,758
lt will come true, hopefully it will

647
01:08:05,123 --> 01:08:08,697
- Good night
- Good night

648
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:39,227
Why has life suddenly changed?

649
01:08:39,358 --> 01:08:42,898
lt has a totally di_erent meaning

650
01:08:43,028 --> 01:08:50,476
lt's got a new taste,
that cheered up my gloomy days

651
01:08:50,770 --> 01:08:54,377
Why has life suddenly changed?

652
01:08:54,507 --> 01:08:57,980
lt has a totally di_erent meaning

653
01:08:58,111 --> 01:09:06,527
lt's got a new taste,
that cheered up my gloomy days

654
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:29,082
Who changed the aspect
of my whole future life?

655
01:09:29,209 --> 01:09:36,824
Who changed the dream
of all those years to come?

656
01:09:36,951 --> 01:09:44,265
Who gave me solace
and strengthened my soul?

657
01:09:44,391 --> 01:09:48,398
Why has life suddenly changed?

658
01:09:48,528 --> 01:09:52,069
lt has a totally di_erent meaning

659
01:09:52,199 --> 01:09:59,581
lt's got a new taste,
that cheered up my gloomy days

660
01:09:59,874 --> 01:10:03,448
Why has life suddenly changed?

661
01:10:03,578 --> 01:10:07,319
lt has a totally di_erent meaning

662
01:10:07,449 --> 01:10:15,966
lt's got a new taste,
l've never ever thought about

663
01:10:30,473 --> 01:10:38,187
Here l am alive again,
l wanna live my whole life again

664
01:10:38,314 --> 01:10:45,661
Here l am alive again,
l wanna live my whole life again

665
01:10:45,954 --> 01:10:53,536
l wanna open my heart to the
world and embrace it with both arms

666
01:10:53,662 --> 01:10:57,536
Why has life suddenly changed?

667
01:10:57,666 --> 01:11:01,040
lt has a totally di_erent meaning

668
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:08,985
lt's got a new taste,
l've never ever thought about

669
01:11:09,111 --> 01:11:12,652
Why has life suddenly changed?

670
01:11:12,949 --> 01:11:16,489
lt has a totally di_erent meaning

671
01:11:16,619 --> 01:11:26,206
lt's got a new taste,
l've never ever thought about

672
01:11:40,678 --> 01:11:42,982
How come they don't
know anything about his trip?

673
01:11:43,113 --> 01:11:45,350
Mrs. Hind, l'm as amazed
and worried as you are

674
01:11:45,483 --> 01:11:47,453
Yussef told us that our headquarter
in Egypt is sending him on this trip

675
01:11:47,585 --> 01:11:49,120
and to our greatest surprise,
we found out he took a leave

676
01:11:49,254 --> 01:11:51,156
and he urged them to say
that he's on a business trip abroad

677
01:11:51,289 --> 01:11:53,058
in case somebody asked them

678
01:11:53,191 --> 01:11:55,261
l wouldn't have known about this

679
01:11:55,393 --> 01:11:58,132
if l didn't have acquaintances
in the headquarter in Egypt

680
01:12:16,481 --> 01:12:20,188
The person you're
asking about booked a ticket here

681
01:12:20,318 --> 01:12:23,290
but according to my
data he still hasn't used it

682
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:25,993
What does it mean?
He didn't leave the country?

683
01:12:26,124 --> 01:12:28,462
l can't be sure

684
01:12:58,124 --> 01:12:59,961
You found anything?

685
01:13:00,059 --> 01:13:05,236
lt's a disaster, Yussef had
made plans to leave us forever

686
01:13:06,699 --> 01:13:09,738
What are you talking about?

687
01:13:09,869 --> 01:13:14,345
Yussef has put everything
in my name, everything he has

688
01:13:14,674 --> 01:13:20,953
- The villa, the car, everything
- What does this mean?

689
01:13:21,148 --> 01:13:26,826
lt means he decided to leave us
forever, to leave me, you and his son

690
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:31,228
And he thought that in return,
he'd pay us some money

691
01:13:31,825 --> 01:13:37,903
No, no, no Hind,
Yussefwould never do this

692
01:13:38,899 --> 01:13:43,341
- Why would he do it?
- l don't know

693
01:14:04,826 --> 01:14:07,665
Let's hope it's not as bad as we think

694
01:14:07,829 --> 01:14:11,035
Only he knows the right reasons

695
01:14:14,336 --> 01:14:17,675
Why is Yussef doing this to me?

696
01:14:17,906 --> 01:14:25,922
- Do l deserve this?
- No dear, you deserve all the best

697
01:14:26,081 --> 01:14:29,253
Just pray the Lord he's okay

698
01:14:29,351 --> 01:14:31,421
We've already asked
everybody who knows him

699
01:14:31,721 --> 01:14:33,958
Let's ask again

700
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,905
Dad, there is one person left to ask

701
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:50,775
- Who is it?
- The cab driver who gave Yussefa lift

702
01:14:59,449 --> 01:15:03,790
Come with me, dear Lord l don't
need this, earlier in the morning

703
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:08,528
- Hey Mursy, call the other drivers quickly
- Yes boss

704
01:15:08,858 --> 01:15:10,294
- Go on quickly
- Yes boss

705
01:15:10,426 --> 01:15:14,000
Look Ma'am, all the cab drivers are
here except three who went to Egypt

706
01:15:14,097 --> 01:15:16,902
Let's hope the one you're
Iooking for is not one of them

707
01:15:22,005 --> 01:15:24,643
- Have we perpetrated any crime, Mr. Abdo?
- Can it, you fool?

708
01:15:24,808 --> 01:15:26,945
ls it one of them?

709
01:15:36,586 --> 01:15:38,791
- l can't remember
- Please ma'am

710
01:15:38,923 --> 01:15:43,799
try to remember, we don't need
to get dragged to the police station

711
01:15:43,928 --> 01:15:46,499
Excuse me Ma'am, Ma'am

712
01:15:46,631 --> 01:15:50,337
Ma'am excuse me,
l'll get in to bring the bag

713
01:15:54,506 --> 01:15:57,778
Excuse me, excuse me Ma'am

714
01:15:57,908 --> 01:16:00,481
Excuse me,
l'll get in to bring the bag

715
01:16:00,578 --> 01:16:03,750
- You drive a Peugeot?
- Most of us drive a Peugeot

716
01:16:03,914 --> 01:16:08,090
- Can l see your car?
- Of course ma'am, everything we do is legal

717
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:10,090
l want you to listen carefully to
what she says and try to remember

718
01:16:10,188 --> 01:16:11,857
- When did this happen?
- One month ago

719
01:16:11,990 --> 01:16:14,260
- His villa is by the sea with a garden
- Yes

720
01:16:14,392 --> 01:16:15,895
- He's an architect?
- Yes

721
01:16:16,028 --> 01:16:17,163
- He's got a light beard?
- Yes

722
01:16:17,295 --> 01:16:18,831
Yeah l remember him now, Ma'am

723
01:16:18,964 --> 01:16:21,201
- He didn't go to the airport
- Why didn't you just say so, you fool?

724
01:16:21,333 --> 01:16:22,568
l just remembered boss

725
01:16:22,868 --> 01:16:25,940
Yes, l gave him a ride to
Old Egypt, to Menyal l suppose

726
01:16:26,071 --> 01:16:27,908
Try to remember
you fool, try to remember

727
01:16:28,073 --> 01:16:30,143
Please, that's enough

728
01:16:30,242 --> 01:16:34,016
Please try to concentrate,
l wanna know everything

729
01:16:35,714 --> 01:16:38,619
Take this roundabout, Ma'am

730
01:16:40,986 --> 01:16:43,725
Now to the right ma'am

731
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:49,500
Stop here, l drove him here first

732
01:16:49,595 --> 01:16:54,371
Please son, you must
know how much we hurt

733
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:57,505
You're not the only one hurting sir,
Yussef is su_ering as well

734
01:16:57,804 --> 01:17:00,843
He concealed his
pain with you around

735
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,845
Yussef left you
something here with me

736
01:17:03,976 --> 01:17:06,882
l told him from the beginning
he shouldn't hide the truth

737
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:09,985
coz it won't help him

738
01:17:10,650 --> 01:17:15,493
You're the ones he loves
most and you could help him

739
01:17:24,364 --> 01:17:26,234
That's it

740
01:17:35,409 --> 01:17:36,979
You're chatting with
someone special, doc.?

741
01:17:37,111 --> 01:17:38,848
How are you doing Shams?
How are you Yussef?

742
01:17:38,979 --> 01:17:43,120
l'm glad you're here, look here,
these are your analysis results

743
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:46,490
This is the last one, compared to
the first one you did when you got here

744
01:17:46,621 --> 01:17:49,793
the curve is increasing and
improving, we're about to succeed

745
01:17:49,924 --> 01:17:51,994
- Thank God
- Yes of course, thank God

746
01:17:52,127 --> 01:17:55,032
You'll be soon back
to your normal lives

747
01:17:55,163 --> 01:17:58,802
You must be missing the theater, the
audience and the standing ovation, Shams

748
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:01,972
And you Yussef, you must
be missing your son and daughter

749
01:18:14,650 --> 01:18:18,023
To achieve these results...

750
01:18:19,388 --> 01:18:22,226
the treatment had to be done
between the hospital and your house

751
01:18:22,391 --> 01:18:25,263
the next one can be
all done outside the hospital

752
01:18:25,394 --> 01:18:29,268
this is why l have a great
surprise for both of you

753
01:18:31,133 --> 01:18:32,735
You still don't wanna
tell us where we're going

754
01:18:32,868 --> 01:18:34,906
You'll soon know

755
01:18:36,939 --> 01:18:39,243
Good evening, Aswan

756
01:18:40,009 --> 01:18:42,046
Now you know

757
01:18:42,144 --> 01:18:46,252
Dr. Ali Abdel Hamid established
a health resort there by the Nile

758
01:18:46,382 --> 01:18:48,754
You'll get your treatment
there and entertain yourselves

759
01:18:48,918 --> 01:18:51,790
- Who's Dr. Ali Abdel Hamid?
- It's my father

760
01:18:59,629 --> 01:19:03,203
- Can we see Dr. Hisham?
- He's not here, he's abroad right now

761
01:19:03,299 --> 01:19:07,207
l would like to ask you about one of his
patients who's called Yussef, Yussef El Ady

762
01:19:07,337 --> 01:19:11,645
The architect Yussef, he's the
most handsome patient l've ever seen

763
01:19:11,807 --> 01:19:14,079
may he and Miss Shams get well
soon and live happily ever after together

764
01:19:14,177 --> 01:19:16,180
- Who's Shams?
- Who are you?

765
01:19:16,346 --> 01:19:21,389
- l'm his wife
- His wife?

766
01:19:21,885 --> 01:19:25,892
Mr. Yussef is in Aswan
and he'll be back on Saturday

767
01:19:28,025 --> 01:19:32,801
Before l came to live here, l never
imagined l'd be able to leave the hospital

768
01:19:32,896 --> 01:19:35,000
until l felt exhausted

769
01:19:35,131 --> 01:19:39,307
so l came here for
recreation and l felt alive again

770
01:19:39,470 --> 01:19:45,114
Then l decided to change my whole life and
maintain the health that's been restored here

771
01:19:45,209 --> 01:19:48,381
and turn this place into
a health resort to help any patient

772
01:19:48,746 --> 01:19:51,118
who needs to be treated
in such a healthy environment

773
01:19:51,249 --> 01:19:53,988
and at the same time, l'd help
Dr. Hisham carry out his research

774
01:19:54,085 --> 01:19:55,755
God bless you, hajji

775
01:19:55,887 --> 01:19:59,694
You know something? No patient
has ever come here and left unhealed

776
01:19:59,824 --> 01:20:03,297
lt seems to me there's
a secret dwelling in this place

777
01:20:03,394 --> 01:20:05,999
- A secret?
- Yes, a secret

778
01:20:06,163 --> 01:20:09,938
This place helped me to
discover the inner secret of life

779
01:20:10,034 --> 01:20:12,806
This secret exists inside
each and every one of us

780
01:20:13,004 --> 01:20:19,150
Just like this Nile, it withstood
over the years and still flows

781
01:20:19,311 --> 01:20:23,018
and it'll remain forever, coz the secret
of his strength and power exists within

782
01:20:23,148 --> 01:20:24,851
God provided each one
of us with an inner power

783
01:20:24,984 --> 01:20:29,158
if we discovered it, we can
overcome any di_iculty and beat it

784
01:20:29,288 --> 01:20:32,160
including pain and sickness

785
01:28:28,246 --> 01:28:30,618
Get me the lab, please

786
01:28:33,685 --> 01:28:38,095
Hello, this is Dr. Hisham,
Mr. Yussef will go to you in a second

787
01:28:38,257 --> 01:28:41,896
l want you to take a blood sample and
run the necessary tests on him, thank you

788
01:28:42,028 --> 01:28:44,632
Yussef, after going to the lab,
take a rest and l'll see you at lunch

789
01:28:44,897 --> 01:28:46,367
Okay

790
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,806
Shouldn't we wait for
Shams to run the tests together?

791
01:28:50,870 --> 01:28:54,209
- Really?
- No doctor, it's science and theories

792
01:28:54,340 --> 01:28:57,980
we don't wanna spoil everything,
that is if you don't mind

793
01:29:00,514 --> 01:29:02,751
Come on in

794
01:29:04,384 --> 01:29:08,291
Somebody's asking for you outside,
it's the wife and father of Mr. Yussef

795
01:29:08,355 --> 01:29:12,463
Say again, his wife?

796
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:28,744
Good morning

797
01:29:30,811 --> 01:29:34,585
- Good morning, good morning
- Good morning

798
01:29:35,382 --> 01:29:38,054
- Miss Shams
- Hello there

799
01:29:38,152 --> 01:29:39,822
You really are a nice girl

800
01:29:39,953 --> 01:29:44,163
l found you a handsome fellow
in Aswan, the best of them all

801
01:29:44,325 --> 01:29:46,929
- Dr. Hisham wants your blood sample
- Later, Safaa

802
01:29:46,994 --> 01:29:50,901
But Dr. Hisham insisted to send
you to the lab the minute you get here

803
01:29:51,066 --> 01:29:52,936
Okay, but on one condition

804
01:29:53,068 --> 01:29:58,044
You'll take me to the lab and
tell me about this week's fiancé

805
01:29:58,706 --> 01:30:03,415
What's wrong Safaa?
This week's fiancé was that terrible?

806
01:30:03,778 --> 01:30:09,356
- There's something l wanna tell you
- Safaa, l'm very happy right now

807
01:30:09,450 --> 01:30:11,888
and it seems to me you're gonna
blow it, l'll go to the lab all by myself

808
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:14,859
- But Miss Shams
- No, no, no

809
01:30:31,107 --> 01:30:33,110
Come on in

810
01:30:43,519 --> 01:30:45,022
Daddy

811
01:31:19,957 --> 01:31:22,394
Thank you very much

812
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:31,604
l guess l'm not late

813
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:41,549
Excuse me, l didn't
know there's someone here

814
01:31:41,712 --> 01:31:45,619
Welcome, you must be Shams

815
01:31:46,785 --> 01:31:48,788
Yes Ma'am

816
01:31:51,455 --> 01:31:54,962
Have a seat Shams, this is Mr. Hassan,
YusseFs father and that's his son

817
01:31:55,126 --> 01:31:57,096
and Mrs. Hind, his wife

818
01:31:57,228 --> 01:32:00,702
You must be Miss Shams, the most
famous and beautiful ballerina in all of Egypt

819
01:32:00,898 --> 01:32:03,069
everybody is talking
about you here in the hospital

820
01:32:03,167 --> 01:32:05,839
Why are you standing?
Please have a seat

821
01:32:05,937 --> 01:32:11,114
You brought flowers too,
we should be bringing you flowers

822
01:32:11,710 --> 01:32:14,983
You're much better now, right?

823
01:33:16,777 --> 01:33:21,119
Yussef improved much
quicker than l had expected

824
01:33:21,248 --> 01:33:24,053
that's notjust due to
the treatment and the medicines

825
01:33:24,184 --> 01:33:25,220
it's due to Shams
who stood by his side

826
01:33:25,319 --> 01:33:29,126
with their love, they resisted
their illness and overcame it

827
01:33:29,290 --> 01:33:33,164
ln the end, all l care about is
my son's health and life, doctor

828
01:33:33,260 --> 01:33:36,065
but we don't wanna be unfair

829
01:33:36,230 --> 01:33:39,035
the fact is that Yussef is already married
and his wife has every right to be with him

830
01:33:39,233 --> 01:33:44,176
The fact is also that the lives of both
patients depends on them being together

831
01:33:44,305 --> 01:33:45,808
l have nothing against Hind

832
01:33:45,873 --> 01:33:48,912
l know she's been treated unfairly
and she's defending her rights

833
01:33:49,043 --> 01:33:52,984
but there is nothing more important
and more sacred than the right to life itself

834
01:33:53,114 --> 01:33:55,352
if Yussef and Shams got
separated now, especially this way

835
01:33:55,716 --> 01:33:58,689
l'm sure their health
will completely deteriorate

836
01:33:58,786 --> 01:34:00,189
l don't understand
why are you so sad

837
01:34:00,288 --> 01:34:04,396
this is the warm welcome you're giving me
after all you did in the last couple of months?

838
01:34:04,725 --> 01:34:07,164
Hind, you didn't even notice
how rude you were with her

839
01:34:07,262 --> 01:34:09,299
How was l supposed to be?

840
01:34:09,431 --> 01:34:12,336
Since l arrived to this hospital,
everybody is talking about you two

841
01:34:12,634 --> 01:34:18,412
Hind please, this is neither the right time
nor the right place to discuss anything

842
01:34:22,778 --> 01:34:24,848
- You forgot she's ill?
- No l didn't

843
01:34:25,013 --> 01:34:27,985
she forgot you're married
and she forgot you have a son

844
01:34:28,116 --> 01:34:29,953
and you forgot what you mean to me

845
01:34:30,085 --> 01:34:32,723
l never imagined you'd
make me face such a situation

846
01:34:32,855 --> 01:34:36,829
l'd never forgive you, Yussef, never

847
01:34:39,328 --> 01:34:42,067
- l turned out to be wrong in the end
- l don't mean that, sweetie

848
01:34:42,165 --> 01:34:44,235
all l'm trying to say
is we made sure he's okay

849
01:34:44,533 --> 01:34:47,706
- And now everything will be okay
- What's okay, dad?

850
01:34:47,871 --> 01:34:51,712
- Now that l'm sure he's with her
- You don't know everything

851
01:34:51,841 --> 01:34:54,111
- Let me tell you what's going on
- Tell me what?

852
01:34:54,210 --> 01:34:56,080
That Yussef is ill and about to die?

853
01:34:56,245 --> 01:35:00,052
lnstead of dying with his son and l,
he choose to die in somebody else's arms

854
01:35:00,149 --> 01:35:03,054
That's what you wanna tell me?

855
01:35:09,226 --> 01:35:15,071
So this is it, Yussef?
This is how easily you'd let me go?

856
01:35:16,066 --> 01:35:18,303
This is how worthless
our love was to you?

857
01:35:18,435 --> 01:35:23,344
- You can't possess the one you love
- l never possessed him, l loved him

858
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:26,613
- But you're just making him su_er even more
- What about my su_ering?

859
01:35:26,744 --> 01:35:30,383
You love him, what would love
mean without forgiveness and sacrifice?

860
01:35:30,648 --> 01:35:31,950
Then she must sacrifice

861
01:35:32,149 --> 01:35:35,923
- If she really loves him, she must go away
- But she's ill, she's weak

862
01:35:35,986 --> 01:35:39,125
And without him, l'm a thousand
times much weaker than she is

863
01:35:39,290 --> 01:35:41,126
l won't let you go away

864
01:35:41,259 --> 01:35:44,164
- How can you leave the country?
- l must leave

865
01:35:48,632 --> 01:35:50,303
Why are so determined to make us su_er?

866
01:35:50,468 --> 01:35:51,770
You're making me su_er

867
01:35:51,903 --> 01:35:54,207
l feel like a filthy criminal
forjust being a part of your life

868
01:35:54,338 --> 01:35:55,909
Your wife and son
deserves you better than l do

869
01:35:56,074 --> 01:35:57,042
What about you?

870
01:35:57,175 --> 01:35:58,477
- What about me?
- What about your right?

871
01:35:58,710 --> 01:36:01,649
Those who are unfair to others
have no right at all, Yussef

872
01:36:01,846 --> 01:36:06,890
The whole life is unfair to them,
their sole right is to find love

873
01:36:06,985 --> 01:36:10,759
coz love would fairly make up
for any pain they endured in this life

874
01:36:11,222 --> 01:36:14,295
But sometimes, even love is unfair

875
01:36:14,393 --> 01:36:19,269
then, it causes a terrible su_ering
like no other ever known to man

876
01:36:19,398 --> 01:36:20,366
Shams, l'm sorry

877
01:36:20,699 --> 01:36:22,169
Please Yussef, l don't
wanna talk about it anymore

878
01:36:22,334 --> 01:36:23,302
No, we have to talk

879
01:36:23,402 --> 01:36:25,439
- Talk about what?
- About what happened

880
01:36:25,771 --> 01:36:29,946
What happened is only normal,
it was meant to happen eventually

881
01:36:30,042 --> 01:36:33,047
What's not normal is you being here

882
01:36:38,017 --> 01:36:40,054
Shams, please listen to me

883
01:36:40,185 --> 01:36:43,760
l don't wanna lose it all just like this

884
01:36:43,889 --> 01:36:46,160
Nothing will be lost

885
01:36:46,258 --> 01:36:50,232
coz we had no right to this life
and this feeling in the fist place

886
01:36:50,396 --> 01:36:52,501
it shouldn't have happened

887
01:36:52,732 --> 01:36:56,071
l should have fought this feeling,
l should have went away

888
01:36:56,336 --> 01:36:59,442
lt's no crime, l just fell in love with you

889
01:36:59,772 --> 01:37:01,142
Me too

890
01:37:01,274 --> 01:37:03,378
l fell in love with you too

891
01:37:03,510 --> 01:37:06,315
it was against my will although
l knew perfectly well you were married

892
01:37:06,412 --> 01:37:08,483
and had a son

893
01:37:10,583 --> 01:37:17,029
but l couldn't see how hideous this
was until l saw you with them today

894
01:37:51,225 --> 01:37:53,329
You fell in love with him?

895
01:37:53,460 --> 01:37:55,298
_es

896
01:37:55,897 --> 01:37:58,167
Did he hurt you?

897
01:38:00,635 --> 01:38:04,008
No mom, l hurt myself

898
01:38:04,138 --> 01:38:08,847
l've never seen you as happy as
you were those last couple of days

899
01:38:09,010 --> 01:38:13,252
And l'd never be as sad
as the next couple of days

900
01:38:13,949 --> 01:38:17,055
if only l'd never met him

901
01:38:18,220 --> 01:38:21,326
Mom, we should leave
this country, l can't stand it

902
01:38:21,456 --> 01:38:25,731
Shams honey, ballet dancing is
the most important thing in your life

903
01:38:25,861 --> 01:38:27,698
it'll make up your loss

904
01:38:28,296 --> 01:38:32,439
- But this time, my loss is great
- Even though, honey

905
01:38:32,702 --> 01:38:34,104
God will make it up for you

906
01:38:34,236 --> 01:38:36,641
The Bolshoi performance
will take place soon

907
01:38:36,805 --> 01:38:38,242
l want you to concentrate
on your training

908
01:38:38,374 --> 01:38:41,045
and you'll be a huge
success and you'll forget

909
01:38:41,144 --> 01:38:42,713
You'll see

910
01:38:42,845 --> 01:38:45,317
l can't stand this pain, l wanna leave

911
01:38:46,416 --> 01:38:49,990
Calm down honey, it's okay, alright, alright

912
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:54,294
we're gonna leave the
country, we're gonna leave

913
01:38:54,523 --> 01:38:59,433
What choices are you giving me?
My death or hers?

914
01:38:59,528 --> 01:39:03,704
l'm talking about Yussef, not Shams

915
01:39:03,867 --> 01:39:06,439
Then it's either his death or mine?

916
01:39:06,570 --> 01:39:10,477
- Your death?
- Of course my death, doctor

917
01:39:11,775 --> 01:39:14,280
you think Yussef
is just a husband to me

918
01:39:14,611 --> 01:39:20,789
and l'm just a stupid wife,
blinded by herjealousy

919
01:39:20,884 --> 01:39:25,126
no, it's not the case at all

920
01:39:25,289 --> 01:39:32,069
Yussef is every breath l take

921
01:39:32,196 --> 01:39:36,237
l'm waiting to have him
back and be able to live again

922
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:40,241
l tried, l tried to live without him

923
01:39:40,370 --> 01:39:43,143
before he left, he tried
to teach me many things

924
01:39:43,274 --> 01:39:45,912
and he thought l learned it all

925
01:39:45,977 --> 01:39:48,982
but he forgot to teach
me the most important thing

926
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:52,654
he forgot to teach me
how to live without breathing

927
01:39:52,750 --> 01:39:57,326
Mrs. Hind, l understand perfectly well what
you're saying and l sympathize with you

928
01:39:57,489 --> 01:40:02,098
but l'm afraid he might
die if he stayed with you

929
01:40:02,227 --> 01:40:03,429
He might what?

930
01:40:03,695 --> 01:40:08,271
What have l done to him to let me see
his life dependent of another woman?

931
01:40:08,433 --> 01:40:10,938
Did she love him more than l do?

932
01:40:11,069 --> 01:40:14,676
Did she give him her past and
is willing to give him her future?

933
01:40:14,807 --> 01:40:17,044
Did she make love to him,
and give him Ramy?

934
01:40:17,142 --> 01:40:20,281
l did all that not her

935
01:40:20,813 --> 01:40:25,923
Nobody's saying that's not true,
Mrs. Hind especially not Yussef

936
01:40:26,018 --> 01:40:28,423
but we're facing a new fact now

937
01:40:28,721 --> 01:40:30,724
and we must deal with
it with the utmost compassion

938
01:40:30,889 --> 01:40:32,926
Compassion?

939
01:40:33,059 --> 01:40:37,400
lf he were to die, it should be in my arms,
that's what compassion is all about

940
01:40:37,496 --> 01:40:41,303
l can't live another minute knowing
that he is with another woman

941
01:40:50,142 --> 01:40:53,884
Yussef started his
treatment to get back to you

942
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:56,785
You must believe this to help him

943
01:40:56,916 --> 01:40:59,788
and when he started
his treatment and got better

944
01:40:59,886 --> 01:41:02,291
he let go of us and clung to you

945
01:41:02,455 --> 01:41:06,029
l'm terribly sorry
but l didn't plan anything

946
01:41:06,126 --> 01:41:09,765
We both didn't
plan what was going on

947
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:17,741
We were like walking on
a dark path and all of a sudden

948
01:41:17,872 --> 01:41:19,875
we found a beam of light
that brought us together

949
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:23,947
And this love that was born in the dark,
what chances does it have to survive?

950
01:41:24,111 --> 01:41:27,050
Let me answer
it'll never survive, Shams

951
01:41:27,147 --> 01:41:30,954
You know why? Coz what's born
in darkness is afraid of the light

952
01:41:31,051 --> 01:41:33,322
coz the light unveils its true identity

953
01:41:33,487 --> 01:41:36,427
and reveals his
weakness and cowardice

954
01:41:36,557 --> 01:41:39,195
You're maybe right

955
01:41:39,527 --> 01:41:43,301
but we were just trying to live

956
01:41:43,364 --> 01:41:47,271
- That's the only wrong we did
- You sure are wrong, you know why?

957
01:41:47,435 --> 01:41:50,374
Coz those who wanna live shouldn't
live on the corpses of others

958
01:41:50,538 --> 01:41:56,149
That's enough Hind, l'm not
saying that coz l'm clinging to Yussef

959
01:41:56,210 --> 01:42:01,454
On the contrary,
l wanted you to believe us

960
01:42:01,983 --> 01:42:04,120
and understand us
to be able to forgive him

961
01:42:04,252 --> 01:42:08,159
You must at least forgive Yussef
coz he deserves your forgiveness

962
01:42:08,323 --> 01:42:11,630
He deserves to have you by his side

963
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:20,737
Let's go Ramy

964
01:43:29,140 --> 01:43:34,016
Shams, Shams, help, help me

965
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:43,990
Come on in

966
01:43:46,290 --> 01:43:51,333
Dr. Ibrahim sent you this fax,
it's the blood test result of Mr. Yussef

967
01:44:09,847 --> 01:44:14,791
We faced the same
situation but l acted di_erently

968
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:16,857
You want me to believe
that you loved Shams

969
01:44:16,989 --> 01:44:20,863
- And sacrificed your love that easily?
- Yes

970
01:44:20,993 --> 01:44:24,633
Love means to make
your loved one happy

971
01:44:24,764 --> 01:44:29,105
lf l had the same impact
on her life as Yussef

972
01:44:29,234 --> 01:44:33,275
l'd give my life for her notjust my love

973
01:44:36,008 --> 01:44:38,813
Could you take a look at these reports?

974
01:44:38,911 --> 01:44:40,881
How would l understand
the medical reports?

975
01:44:41,013 --> 01:44:47,459
Forget about the figures, just read
the doctor's remarks at the page bottom

976
01:44:51,891 --> 01:44:55,064
These results show
how deteriorated the health

977
01:44:55,128 --> 01:44:56,865
of Yussef and Shams have become lately

978
01:44:57,030 --> 01:45:01,171
- Shams again?
- l'll keep repeating it as long as it takes!

979
01:45:01,301 --> 01:45:06,612
l can'tjust talk about Yussef
coz l know who am l talking with

980
01:45:06,773 --> 01:45:09,712
Yussef told me how
kindhearted you are

981
01:45:09,810 --> 01:45:13,651
l don't wanna see this pure
hearted tainted with a black hole

982
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:16,985
Then you might never
be able to forgive yourself

983
01:45:17,118 --> 01:45:22,194
Yussef got back to you coz he didn't
wanna hurt you more than he's already done

984
01:45:22,656 --> 01:45:25,061
This is the result

985
01:45:25,225 --> 01:45:28,665
He's getting much worse
and he might die within months

986
01:45:28,830 --> 01:45:33,839
and Shams will soon follow him
that is if she doesn't die before him

987
01:45:33,968 --> 01:45:37,140
How would you feel then?

988
01:45:37,271 --> 01:45:40,143
Could you feel guilty coz
you didn't let him live months

989
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:43,313
or years or even a few days longer?

990
01:45:43,611 --> 01:45:46,717
How can you live with this feeling?

991
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:50,587
Think carefully

992
01:45:50,785 --> 01:45:58,667
Not about Yussef, about your son... l don't
think you'd hate his father staying with him

993
01:48:36,723 --> 01:48:40,096
lt's been a while the
sailor hasn't went to the sea

994
01:48:40,226 --> 01:48:44,602
Coz he can'tjump
in the water anymore

995
01:48:44,764 --> 01:48:47,034
lt's not the water
that matters, Yussef

996
01:48:47,132 --> 01:48:50,640
Many people would want
to stay with him even on the shore

997
01:48:50,803 --> 01:48:52,840
What's important
is for him to come back

998
01:48:52,938 --> 01:48:55,811
l've been unfair to you
and l hurt you deeply, Hind

999
01:48:56,276 --> 01:49:01,152
l still dare to ask
you for your forgiveness

1000
01:49:01,381 --> 01:49:06,892
Each time l look at you,
l get a feeling we grew up together

1001
01:49:07,087 --> 01:49:10,794
As if we've been
married for 30 years

1002
01:49:12,359 --> 01:49:15,466
Forgive me coz l don't
know what happened

1003
01:49:15,796 --> 01:49:19,370
And forgive me coz
l'd never have a reason

1004
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:20,000
lf you stay with Shams

1005
01:49:22,035 --> 01:49:24,707
You'll give her a chance to live

1006
01:49:24,838 --> 01:49:28,378
And you'll have
the chance to live too

1007
01:49:32,479 --> 01:49:34,918
Go to her, Yussef

1008
01:49:35,349 --> 01:49:38,088
l'm asking you to do that

1009
01:49:42,523 --> 01:49:44,694
Don't worry about me

1010
01:49:45,492 --> 01:49:49,768
As for me, l told you my secret

1011
01:49:49,931 --> 01:49:53,505
One look at your eyes
is worth 30 years of marriage

1012
01:49:53,602 --> 01:49:58,812
And the past years you've given
me will be enough for the rest of my life

1013
01:49:59,006 --> 01:50:03,014
Ramy is a part of you, Yussef

1014
01:50:03,178 --> 01:50:07,921
l held him in my arms, and
l will be holding him until the day l die

1015
01:50:39,349 --> 01:50:40,884
Shams, Ballet Jezel

1016
01:53:57,719 --> 01:54:00,023
What are you saying Shams?

1017
01:54:06,261 --> 01:54:11,605
- You want us to be separated?
- Never say that

1018
01:54:12,534 --> 01:54:16,208
We'll have each other deep
within until the day we die

1019
01:54:16,838 --> 01:54:20,612
lt's just that we
won't be living together

1020
01:54:21,377 --> 01:54:26,988
Your love that lives deep down
my heart will help me live happily

1021
01:54:27,083 --> 01:54:29,153
Knowing that you're
with your wife and kid

1022
01:54:29,318 --> 01:54:31,422
But l've never

1023
01:54:31,888 --> 01:54:35,094
And my love that lives
deep down your heart

1024
01:54:35,191 --> 01:54:40,769
Will help you live happily knowing
that l'm living for my ballet dancing

1025
01:54:40,897 --> 01:54:43,435
that l hold very dear

1026
01:54:50,573 --> 01:54:55,816
Hind made a big sacrifice
l wouldn't be able to make in her place

1027
01:54:55,879 --> 01:55:01,189
Her sacrifice made
me carry on my dream

1028
01:55:01,584 --> 01:55:04,924
and go back to the ballet
dancing l hold very dear

1029
01:55:05,055 --> 01:55:12,437
Only today, only today
l found myself able to reward her

1030
01:55:46,397 --> 01:55:52,376
15 years later

1031
01:55:59,877 --> 01:56:02,683
The interior design prizes

1032
01:56:02,781 --> 01:56:08,659
The first prize was chosen
upon a unanimous agreement

1033
01:56:08,821 --> 01:56:14,164
and it goes to the architect
Ramy Yussef El Ady

1034
01:56:18,964 --> 01:56:21,001
Congratulations Ramy

1035
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:22,268
those sketches you
used to draw as a small kid

1036
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:25,541
proved to me you'll make
a great interior designer

1037
01:56:25,638 --> 01:56:28,209
much better than l was

1038
01:56:28,308 --> 01:56:31,814
l'm sure you'll win numerous prizes

1039
01:56:32,245 --> 01:56:36,786
and you'll be a renowned
and successful interior designer

1040
01:56:38,684 --> 01:56:40,989
congratulations sweetie

1041
01:56:55,569 --> 01:56:57,806
