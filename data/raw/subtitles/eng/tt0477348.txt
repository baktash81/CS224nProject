1
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,400
I was sheriff of this county
when I was 25 years old.

2
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,300
Hard to believe.

3
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,900
My grandfather was a lawman.
Father too.

4
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,700
Me and him was sheriffs at the same
time, him up in Plano and me out here.

5
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,700
I think he's pretty proud of that.

6
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,300
I know I was.

7
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,300
Some of the old-time sheriffs
never even wore a gun.

8
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,000
Folks find that hard to believe.
Jim Scarborough never carried one.

9
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,700
That's the younger Jim.

10
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,200
Gaston Boykins wouldn't wear one
up in Comanche County.

11
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,800
I always liked to hear
about the old-timers.

12
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,900
Never missed a chance to do so.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,500
You can't help but compare yourself
against the old-timers.

14
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,400
Can't help but wonder
how they'd have operated these times.

15
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,400
There's this boy I sent to the electric
chair at Huntsville here a while back.

16
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,800
My arrest and my testimony.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,500
He killed a 14-year-old girl.

18
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,000
Paper said it was a crime of passion,

19
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,000
but he told me there
wasn't any passion to it.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,300
Told me he'd planned to kill somebody
for as long as he could remember.

21
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,200
Said if they turned him out,
he'd do it again.

22
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,900
Said he knew he was going to hell.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,400
Be there in about 15 minutes.

24
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,200
I don't know what to make of that.

25
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,500
I sure do don't.

26
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,300
The crime you see now,
it's hard to even take its measure.

27
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,100
It's not that I'm afraid of it.

28
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,900
I always knew you had to be willing
to die to even do this job.

29
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,200
But I don't want to push
my chips forward and go out

30
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,800
and meet something I don't understand.

31
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,200
A man would have
to put his soul at hazard.

32
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,000
He'd have to say, "OK.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,200
I'll be part of this world. "

34
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,600
Yes, sir, I just walked in the door.

35
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,800
He had some sort of thing on him,

36
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,400
like a oxygen tank
for emphysema or something,

37
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,800
and a hose that run down his sleeve.

38
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,400
Oxygen tank?
What the hell's he got that for?

39
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,300
You got me. Well,
you can look at it when you get in.

40
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,800
- I'll be down there in a bit.
- Yes, sir, I got it under control.

41
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,500
- Howdy. What's this about?
- Step out of the car please, sir.

42
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,800
What is that?

43
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,200
I need you to step out of the car, sir.

44
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,000
- What is that for?
- Would you...?

45
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,100
Would you hold still please, sir?

46
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,100
You hold still.

47
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,100
Shit.

48
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,300
Agua.

49
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,400
Agua.

50
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,200
Agua.

51
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,100
I ain't got no water.

52
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,200
Agua.

53
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,800
Agua.

54
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,200
I told you I ain't got no agua.

55
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,400
Do you speak English?

56
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,700
Where's the last guy?

57
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,500
Último hombre, last man standing. There
must have been one. Where'd he go?

58
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,800
I reckon I go out the way I come in.

59
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,900
Hay lobos.

60
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,400
There ain't no lobos.

61
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,200
You stopped to watch
your backtrack.

62
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,100
Now shoot my dumb ass.

63
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,900
But if you stop,

64
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
you stopped in shade.

65
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
Yeah.

66
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,300
Hmm.

67
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,300
Mmm.

68
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,300
My place is wrong?

69
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,000
Yours is the first place
Danzer and Dora will look if they...

70
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
If they know.

71
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,100
- What's in the satchel?
- It's full of money.

72
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,500
That would be the day.

73
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,300
- Where'd you get the pistol?
- at the gettin' place.

74
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,800
- Did you buy that gun?
- No. I found it.

75
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,200
- Llewelyn.
- What? Quit your hollering.

76
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
What'd you get for that thing?

77
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,200
You don't need to know everything,
Carla Jean.

78
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,600
- I need to know that.
- Keep running that mouth of yours,

79
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,300
I'm gonna take you in the back
and screw you.

80
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,500
- Big talk.
- Keep it up.

81
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,700
Fine. I don't want to know.

82
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,700
I don't even want to know
where you been all day.

83
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,500
That'll work.

84
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,200
All right.

85
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,300
- Llewelyn?
- Yeah?

86
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,000
- What're you doing, baby?
- I'm going out.

87
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,300
Going where?

88
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,200
A little something I forgot to do,
but I'll be back.

89
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,600
- And what're you gonna do?
- I'm fixing to do something

90
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,900
dumber than hell, but I'm going anyways.

91
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,500
If I don't come back,
you tell Mother I love her.

92
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,700
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.

93
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,100
Well, then I'll tell her myself.

94
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,600
- How much?
- Sixty-nine cents.

95
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,200
And the gas?

96
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,800
Y'all getting any rain up your way?

97
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:12,100
- What way would that be?
- Well, I seen you was from Dallas.

98
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,200
What business is it of yours
where I'm from...

99
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,800
...friendo?

100
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,400
- Well, I didn't mean nothing by it.
- You didn't mean nothing?

101
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,900
I was just passing the time.

102
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:33,000
If you don't want to accept that,
I don't know what else I can do for you.

103
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,500
- Will there be something else?
- I don't know. Will there?

104
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,800
- Is something wrong?
- With what?

105
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,200
With anything.

106
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,500
Is that what you're asking me?
Is there something wrong with anything?

107
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,000
- Will there be anything else?
- You already asked me that.

108
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,900
- Well, I need to see about closing now.
- See about closing?

109
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,900
- Yes, sir.
- What time do you close?

110
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,200
- Now. We close now.
- Now is not a time.

111
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:13,400
- What time do you close?
- Generally around dark. at dark.

112
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,200
You don't know what
you're talking about, do you?

113
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,400
Sir?

114
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,200
I said you don't know
what you're talking about.

115
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,200
- What time do you go to bed?
- Sir?

116
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,900
You're a bit deaf, aren't you?
I said, what time do you go to bed?

117
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
Oh.

118
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,800
Somewhere around 9:30.
I'd say around 9:30.

119
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,500
I could come back then.

120
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,000
Why would you be coming back?
We'll be closed.

121
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,800
Yeah, you said that.

122
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,600
- Well, I got to close now.
- You live in that house out back?

123
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,800
- Yes, I do.
- You lived here all your life?

124
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:03,400
Well, this is my wife's
father's place, originally.

125
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,100
You married into it?

126
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,100
We lived in Temple, Texas
for many years.

127
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,100
Raised a family there. In Temple.

128
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,300
- We come out here about four years ago.
- You married into it?

129
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,600
- If that's the way you want to put it.
- Well, I don't have some way to put it.

130
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,400
That's the way it is.

131
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,400
What's the most you ever lost
on a coin toss?

132
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:42,500
- Sir?
- The most you ever lost on a coin toss?

133
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,100
Oh, I don't know. I couldn't say.

134
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,500
- Call it.
- Call it?

135
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,700
- Yes.
- For what?

136
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,000
Just call it.

137
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,300
Well, we need to know
what we're calling it for here.

138
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,800
You need to call it.
I can't call it for you.

139
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,000
- Or it wouldn't be fair.
- I didn't put nothing up.

140
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,600
Yes, you did. You've been
putting it up your whole life.

141
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,000
You just didn't know it.

142
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,100
- You know what date is on this coin?
- No.

143
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,500
1958. It's been traveling
22 years to get here.

144
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:25,300
And now it's here.
And it's either heads or tails.

145
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,700
You have to say. Call it.

146
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,200
Well, look,
I need to know what I stand to win.

147
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,100
- Everything.
- How's that?

148
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,800
You stand to win everything. Call it.

149
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,300
All right. Heads, then.

150
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,300
Well done.

151
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,400
- Don't put it in your pocket.
- Sir?

152
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,600
Don't put it in your pocket.
It's your lucky quarter.

153
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,600
Where do you want me to put it?

154
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,800
Anywhere not in your pocket.

155
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,300
Or it'll get mixed in with the others
and become just a coin.

156
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,900
Which it is.

157
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,200
Llewelyn?

158
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,800
What the hell?

159
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,200
- Odessa.
- Why would we go to Odessa?

160
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,700
No, not we. You.
You stay with your mother.

161
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,000
Well, how come?

162
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:40,400
Look, right now it's midnight Sunday.
Courthouse opens nine hours from now.

163
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,600
Someone's gonna call in the number
on the inspection plate of my truck.

164
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,900
And around 9:30,
they'll show up here.

165
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,500
- How long do we...?
- What point would you quit

166
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,800
bothering to look
for your two million dollars?

167
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,100
What am I supposed to tell Mama?

168
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,800
Stand in the door and holler,
"Mama, I'm home!"?

169
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,200
- Llewelyn.
- Come on, pack your things.

170
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,100
Anything you leave,
you ain't gonna see again.

171
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,300
Well, don't fall down apologizing.

172
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,600
Oh, baby, things happen.

173
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,500
Come on, I can't take them back.

174
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,000
Mind riding bitch?

175
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,200
- This his truck?
- Mm-hmm.

176
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,100
Got a screwgie?

177
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,800
- Who cut his tires?
- Mexicans, I guess. Wasn't us.

178
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,800
- That is a dead dog.
- Yes, it is.

179
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,100
- Where's the receiver?
- I've got it.

180
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,100
These are some ripe petunias.

181
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,000
Hold this, please.

182
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,600
Want it?

183
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,300
- Getting anything on this?
- Not a bleep.

184
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,100
All right.

185
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,600
Give me that.

186
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,100
- I thought it was a car afire.
- It is a car afire.

187
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,600
Wendell said there's something
in the back country too.

188
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,700
Step in there.

189
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,800
When's the county gonna start
paying rent on my horse?

190
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,900
- I love you more and more every day.
- That's very nice.

191
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,900
- Be careful.
- Always am.

192
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,700
- Don't get hurt.
- Never do.

193
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,600
Don't hurt no one.

194
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,700
If you say so.

195
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,800
- Wouldn't think a car'd burn like that.
- Yes, sir.

196
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,200
We should've brought wienies.

197
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,200
That look like about
a '77 Ford to you, Wendell?

198
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,500
- It could be.
- I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.

199
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,600
- The old boy shot by the highway?
- Yes, sir. His vehicle.

200
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,900
Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car,
killed that man on the highway,

201
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:20,400
swapped for his car, now here it is and
he's swapped again for God knows what.

202
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,800
That's very linear, sheriff.

203
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,100
- Age'll flatten a man, Wendell.
- Yes, sir.

204
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,200
- Then there's this other.
- Yeah.

205
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,500
- You ride Winston.
- You sure?

206
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,900
Oh, I'm more than sure. If anything
happens to Loretta's horse out here,

207
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,400
I can tell you, I don't want
to be the party that was aboard.

208
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:46,300
It's the same tire tread coming back as
going. Made about the same time too.

209
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,600
You can see the sipes real clear.

210
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,400
Somebody's pried the inspection plate
off the door on this one.

211
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,200
I know this truck.

212
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,800
Belongs to a feller named Moss.

213
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,700
- Llewelyn Moss?
- That's the boy.

214
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,700
- You figure him for a dope runner?
- I don't know.

215
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,500
- I kindly doubt it.
- O.K. Corral is just yonder.

216
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,400
Oh, hell's bells,
they even shot the dog.

217
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,600
This is just
a deal gone wrong, isn't it?

218
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:26,000
Yup. Appears to have been
a glitch or two.

219
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,500
- What calibers you got there, sheriff?
- Nine-millimeter.

220
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,700
Couple of.45 ACPs.

221
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,500
Somebody unloaded on that thing
with a shotgun.

222
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,400
How come the coyotes
ain't been at them?

223
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,600
I don't know.

224
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,300
Supposedly, a coyote
won't eat a Mexican.

225
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,800
These boys appear to be managerial.

226
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,200
I think we're looking at more
than one fracas. Execution here.

227
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,700
Wild West over there.

228
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,100
- It's that Mexican brown dope.
- Oh, these boys is all swole up.

229
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,000
So this was earlier.
Getting set to trade.

230
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,000
Then, whoa, differences, and...

231
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:20,000
- Might not even a been no money.
- That's possible.

232
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,400
- But you don't believe it?
- No.

233
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,800
Probably I don't.

234
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,500
Well, it's a mess, ain't it, sheriff?

235
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,300
If it ain't,
it'll do till the mess gets here.

236
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,100
Yes, sir?

237
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,300
- I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
- Did you go up to his trailer?

238
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,300
- Yes, I did.
- Well, I'd say he's at work.

239
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,300
- Do you want to leave a message?
- Where does he work?

240
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,400
I can't say.

241
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,300
Where does he work?

242
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,900
Sir, I ain't at liberty to give out
no information about our residents.

243
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,200
Where does he work?

244
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,300
Did you not hear me?

245
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,400
We can't give out no information.

246
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,700
- Why all the way to Del Rio?
- I'm gonna borrow a car from Roberto.

247
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,700
- You can't afford one?
- I don't want to register it.

248
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,500
- Look, I'll call you in a couple days.
- Promise?

249
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,500
Yes, I do.

250
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,700
- I got a bad feeling, Llewelyn.
- I got a good one. Oughta even out.

251
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:43,100
Listen, you gotta quit
your worrying so much.

252
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,100
- Mama's gonna raise hell.
- Mm-hm.

253
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,200
She's just gonna cuss you up and down.

254
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,000
- Well, you should be used to that.
- I'm used to lots of things.

255
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,100
- I work at Wal-Mart.
- Not anymore, Carla Jean.

256
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,000
You are retired.

257
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,000
- Llewelyn?
- Yes, ma'am?

258
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,700
- You are coming back, ain't you?
- I shall return.

259
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,800
Sheriff's department!

260
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,800
Look at that lock.

261
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,900
- We going in?
- Gun out and up.

262
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,500
- What about yours?
- I'm hiding behind you.

263
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,600
Sheriff's department!

264
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,600
- I believe they done lit a shuck.
- I believe you're right.

265
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,800
- That from the lock?
- Probably must be.

266
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,500
- So when was he here, sheriff?
- I don't know. Oh...

267
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,100
- Now that's aggravating.
- Sheriff?

268
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:18,100
- Still sweating.
- Oh, sheriff! We just missed him!

269
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,400
We gotta circulate this on radio.

270
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,700
All right.

271
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,900
What do we circulate?

272
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,800
Looking for a man
who has recently drunk milk?

273
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:40,100
- Oh, sheriff, that's aggravating.
- I'm ahead of you there.

274
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:46,000
Think this boy Moss has got any notion
of the sorts of sons-of-bitches

275
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,000
- that are hunting him?
- I don't know. He ought to.

276
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:57,100
He's seen the same things I've seen and
it certainly made an impression on me.

277
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,700
- Take me to a motel.
- Got one in mind?

278
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,000
Someplace cheap.

279
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,600
- You tell me the option.
- Do what now?

280
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,300
You pick the option
goes with the applicable rate.

281
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,900
I'm just one person,
so it don't matter the size of the bed.

282
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,000
This is Roberto's
Automotive. I'm not in right now.

283
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,800
Please leave a message.

284
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,700
- Hello?
- Is Llewelyn there?

285
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,200
Llewelyn? No, he ain't.

286
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,200
You expect him?

287
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,100
Now why would
I expect him? Who is this?

288
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,100
- May I help you?
- Yeah, you got a pair of Larry Mahans?

289
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,500
Shoulder, size 11?

290
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,200
- I'll check.
- You all sell socks?

291
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,800
- Just white.
- Well, white's all I wear. Bathroom?

292
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,100
Don't stop.
Just ride me up past those rooms.

293
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:36,200
- What room?
- Just drive me around.

294
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,500
I wanna see if someone's here.

295
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,100
Keep going. Don't stop.

296
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,100
I don't wanna get into
some kind of a jackpot here.

297
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,100
It's all right.

298
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,900
Why don't I just set you down
right here and we won't argue about it?

299
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,200
- Take me to another motel.
- Let's just call it square.

300
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,400
You're in the jackpot,
and I'm trying to get you out of it.

301
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,600
Take me to another motel.

302
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,100
Lab reports from Austin
on that boy by the highway.

303
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,300
- What was the bullet?
- Wasn't no bullet.

304
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,500
- Wasn't no bullet?
- Yes, sir. Wasn't none.

305
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:09,500
Well, Wendell, with all due respect,
that don't make a lot of sense.

306
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,700
No, sir.

307
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,900
You said entry wound in the forehead,
no exit wound.

308
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,300
- Yes, sir.
- You telling me he shot this boy

309
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,700
and then went digging around
with a knife?

310
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,100
- Sir, I don't wanna picture that.
- I don't either.

311
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,500
Can I freshen that there for you,
sheriff?

312
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,500
Yeah, Maureen, you better had.

313
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,300
Ranger and the DEA
are headed back out to the scene.

314
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,000
Gonna join 'em?

315
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,600
Any new bodies accumulate out there?

316
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:42,000
- No, sir.
- Well, then I guess I can skip it.

317
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,800
- Twelve-gauge. You need shells?
- Yeah, double-ought.

318
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:04,700
- Yeah, that'll give you a wallop.
- Y'all got camping supplies?

319
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,100
Tent poles. You already have the tent?

320
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,900
Well, something like that.

321
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,900
Give me the model number on the tent,
I can order poles.

322
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,300
- Never mind. I want a tent.
- What kind?

323
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,400
The kind with most poles.

324
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,500
- Could I get another room?
- You wanna change rooms?

325
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,200
No, ma'am, I wanna keep my room
and get another one.

326
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,800
- Another additional?
- Yes, ma'am.

327
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,200
And do you have a map of the rooms?

328
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,900
Well, yeah, we had a sorta one.

329
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,900
Oh, thank you.

330
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,200
How about 38?

331
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:07,000
Well, you can have the one right next to
yours if you want, 137. It ain't took.

332
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:11,100
- No, 38 will be fine.
- Well, that's got two double beds.

333
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,800
How'd you find that?

334
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,100
You shouldn't be doin' that.

335
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,700
Even a young man like you.

336
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:45,500
- Doin' what?
- Hitchhiking.

337
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:52,900
Dangerous.

338
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,500
You know Anton Chigurh by sight,
is that correct?

339
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:18,100
Yes, sir, I know him every which way.

340
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,500
When did you last see him?

341
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,100
Uh...

342
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:25,300
...November 28th, last year.

343
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,700
Seem pretty sure of the date.
Did I ask you to sit?

344
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:33,600
No, sir, but you struck me as a man
who wouldn't wanna waste a chair.

345
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:39,200
I remember dates, names, numbers.
I saw him November the 28th.

346
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,000
Got a loose cannon here.

347
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:46,500
We're out a bunch of money,
and the other party is out his product.

348
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,400
- Yes, sir.
- This account will give up

349
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,800
$1,200 in any 24-hour period.
That's up from a thousand.

350
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:58,000
If your expenses run higher,
I hope you'll trust us for it.

351
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,200
OK.

352
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:04,100
- Just how well do you know Chigurh?
- What do you wanna know?

353
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:08,000
I just wanna know your opinion of him,
in general.

354
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:13,600
- Just how dangerous is he?
- Compared to what, the bubonic plague?

355
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,800
He's bad enough you called me.

356
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:20,400
Yeah, he's a psychopathic killer,
but so what?

357
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,300
There's plenty of them around.

358
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:25,000
Killed three men
in a Del Rio motel yesterday,

359
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:28,700
and two others in that
colossal goat-fuck out in the desert.

360
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,700
- We can stop that.
- Seem pretty sure of yourself.

361
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:38,400
You've led something of a charmed life,
haven't you, Mr. Wells?

362
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,700
In all honesty, I can't say that charm
has had a whole lot to do with it.

363
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,800
- I was wondering...
- Yes?

364
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,900
Could you validate my parking ticket?

365
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:57,500
- An attempt at humor, I suppose?
- I'm sorry.

366
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:07,700
You know, I counted the floors
to this building from the street.

367
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:10,200
- And?
- There's one missing.

368
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,000
We'll look into it.

369
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,800
One room. One night.

370
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:41,500
- That'll be $26.
- Alrighty.

371
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,800
You on all night?

372
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:50,100
Yes, sir, I'll be right here
till 10:00 in the morning.

373
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:56,200
This here's for you. Now, I ain't
asking you to do anything illegal.

374
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:59,300
There's someone
who been looking for me. Not police.

375
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,100
You just call me
if anyone else checks in tonight.

376
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,400
And by anyone, I mean any swinging dick.

377
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:49,000
There just ain't no way.

378
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:29,300
Don't worry, I ain't gonna hurt you.

379
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,200
I need you
to drive me on outta here.

380
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,500
- Why not?
- I don't know, man.

381
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,300
Were you in a car accident?

382
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:10,600
I'll give you 500 bucks for that coat.

383
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,500
Lemme see the money.

384
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,000
Were you in a car accident?

385
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:22,700
- Yeah.
- OK, give me the money.

386
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:26,700
- It's right here. Give me the clothes.
- Let him hold the money.

387
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:35,000
Give it here.

388
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,000
Gimme that beer too.

389
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:48,500
How much?

390
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:51,100
Brian, give him the beer.

391
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:06,300
Ah!

392
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,700
Médico...

393
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
...porfavor.

394
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,800
Wait up!

395
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:18,700
...and I had a 44 inch waist.
My diet specialist got a hold of me,

396
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,900
and that first week,
I lost seven pounds!

397
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,600
Looking back on the diet, it was
relatively easy to lose the weight,

398
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:28,500
though it did have moments. Sometimes,
it looked as if I gained weight

399
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:32,000
instead of lost it.
The most difficult part is still ahead.

400
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,400
Keeping weight off
now that we've lost it.

401
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,800
It's natural
for you to gain a few pounds.

402
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:40,500
But as soon as you do,
make sure you go on...

403
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:42,100
Here are a few points to remember.
First of all, weigh in every day.

404
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:13,300
Any word on those vehicles yet?

405
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:16,400
Sheriff, I found out
everything there was to find.

406
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:21,100
Those vehicles are titled
and registered to deceased people.

407
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:23,600
The owner of that Bronco's
been dead 20 years.

408
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:25,900
Want me to find out
about the Mexican ones?

409
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,800
No. Lord, no.

410
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:30,900
There's this month's checks.

411
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,500
That DEA agent called again.
You don't wanna talk to him?

412
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:37,300
Gonna try to keep from it much as I can.

413
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:40,300
Going back. Wanted to know
if you wanted to go with him.

414
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,600
That's cordial of him.

415
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,200
Can I get you to call Loretta,

416
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:48,000
tell her I'm going to Odessa
to see Carla Jean Moss?

417
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:51,100
- Yes, sheriff.
- I'll call her when I get there.

418
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:53,900
I'd call now, but if she
want me to come home, I might.

419
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:56,700
Do you want me to wait
till you quit the building?

420
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:00,500
Uh-huh. Don't wanna lie without
what it's absolutely necessary.

421
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:06,600
What is it Torbert says
about truth and justice?

422
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:11,400
Oh, we dedicate ourselves daily anew.
Something like that.

423
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:14,500
I'm gonna commence
dedicating myself twice daily.

424
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:17,400
Might come to three before it's over.

425
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,200
What the hell?

426
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,400
Sheriff?

427
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:33,000
You looked at your load lately?

428
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:39,100
- That is a damn outrage.
- One of those tie-downs worked loose.

429
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:44,500
- How many bodies did you leave with?
- I ain't lost none of 'em, sheriff.

430
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,900
Couldn't y'all have
taken a van out there?

431
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,300
We didn't have no van
with four-wheel drive.

432
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:52,100
You gonna write me up
for improperly secured load?

433
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,100
You get your ass outta here.

434
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:00,500
Buenos días.

435
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:04,100
I'm guessing this isn't the future
you had pictured for yourself

436
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,800
when you first clapped eyes
on that money.

437
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:10,000
Don't worry.
I'm not the man who's after you.

438
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:13,300
I know that.

439
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:15,800
I've seen him.

440
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:19,200
You've seen him?
And you're not dead?

441
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:21,500
Huh.

442
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:24,300
What's this guy supposed to be,
the ultimate badass?

443
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,500
Don't think that's how I'd describe him.

444
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,400
How would you describe him?

445
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:32,700
I guess I'd say
he doesn't have a sense of humor.

446
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:35,300
- His name's Chigurh.
- Sugar?

447
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,800
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh.

448
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:41,200
- You know how he found you?
- Yeah, I know how he found me.

449
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:44,500
- It's called a transponder.
- I know what it's called.

450
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:47,300
- He won't find me again.
- Not that way.

451
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:50,200
- Not any way.
- Took me about three hours.

452
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:54,900
- Yeah, well, I been immobile.
- No. You don't understand.

453
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:00,500
- What do you do?
- I'm retired.

454
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:03,400
- What did you do?
- Welder.

455
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,700
- Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
- Any of it.

456
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:08,300
- If it can be welded, I can weld it.
- Cast iron?

457
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,200
- Yeah.
- I don't mean braze.

458
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,200
- I didn't say braze.
- Pot metal?

459
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:13,700
What did I say?

460
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:20,000
- Were you in 'Nam?
- Yeah, I was 'Nam.

461
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:23,900
So was I.

462
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:26,300
So, what does that make me, your buddy?

463
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:33,100
Look, you gotta give me this money.
I got no other reason to protect you.

464
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,800
It's too late. I spent it.

465
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:40,200
A million and a half
on whores and whiskey,

466
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:43,000
and the rest of it,
I just sorta blew it in.

467
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:47,400
How do you know he's not
on his way to Odessa?

468
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,500
- Why would he go to Odessa?
- Kill your wife.

469
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:07,200
Maybe he's the one
that needs to be worried... about me.

470
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:08,900
He isn't.

471
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,600
Yeah. You're not cut out for this.

472
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:16,200
You're just a guy
who happened to find those vehicles.

473
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:24,300
I'm across the river at the Hotel Eagle.

474
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,800
Carson Wells.

475
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:29,900
Call me when you've had enough.

476
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,900
I can even let you keep
a little of the money.

477
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,400
If I was into cutting deals,
why wouldn't I deal with Sugar?

478
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:40,900
No, no, you don't understand.
You can't make a deal with him.

479
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:45,800
Even if you gave him the money, he'd
still kill you for inconveniencing him.

480
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:48,000
He's a peculiar man.

481
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:53,200
Might even say he has principles,
principles that transcend money or drugs

482
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:56,900
or anything like that. Not like you.

483
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:00,200
Yeah. He's not even like me.

484
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:03,900
No, he don't talk as much as you.
I give him points for that.

485
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,900
Carla Jean, thank you for coming.

486
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,700
Don't know why I did.

487
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,700
I told you, I don't know where he is.

488
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:16,100
- You haven't heard from him?
- No, I ain't.

489
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,000
- Nothing?
- Not word one.

490
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:22,300
- Would you tell me if you had?
- Well, I don't know.

491
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:27,200
- He don't need any trouble from you.
- It ain't me he's in trouble with.

492
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:30,800
- Who's he in trouble with then?
- Some pretty bad people.

493
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:34,700
These people will kill him, Carla Jean.
They won't quit.

494
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:37,800
He won't neither. He never has.

495
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:41,900
He can take all comers.

496
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:47,100
You know Charlie Walser's
got that place out east of Sanderson?

497
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:53,000
You know how he used to slaughter
beeves, hit 'em right there with a maul,

498
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,900
truss 'em and slit their throats?

499
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:58,100
Charlie's got one all trussed up,
all set to drain him

500
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,500
and the beef comes to,
thrashing around.

501
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:04,100
Six hundred pounds
of very pissed off livestock.

502
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:06,700
You'll excuse the... Well...

503
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,400
Charlie grabs a gun,
shoot the thing in the head,

504
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:12,500
but with the swinging and thrashing,
it's a glance shot.

505
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:15,200
Ricochets, hits Charlie in the shoulder.

506
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:18,900
You go see Charlie, he still can't
pick up his right hand for his hat.

507
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:23,200
The point being, that even in
the contest between man and steer,

508
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:25,100
the issue is not certain.

509
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:37,400
When Llewelyn calls,
just tell him I can make him safe.

510
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:46,000
'Course, they slaughter
steers a lot different these days.

511
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:50,200
Use a air gun. Shoots out a little rod
about that far under the brain.

512
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:53,400
Sucks right back in.
Animal never knows what hit him.

513
01:19:56,300 --> 01:20:00,100
- Why are you telling me that, sheriff?
- I don't know.

514
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:05,500
My mind wanders.

515
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:30,900
Hello, Carson.

516
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:34,800
Let's go to your room.

517
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:49,700
You don't have to do this.

518
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:53,800
I'm a day trader.
I could just go home.

519
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:58,600
- You could.
- Make it worth your while,

520
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:02,900
take you to an ATM.
There's 14 grand in it.

521
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,300
And everybody just walks away.

522
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,700
An ATM.

523
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:15,800
I know where the satchel is.

524
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:18,200
If you knew, you would have it with you.

525
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:22,200
I can find it from the river bank.
I know where it is.

526
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:26,600
- I know something better.
- What's that?

527
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:28,200
Where it's going to be.

528
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:33,400
- Where's that?
- It will be brought to me

529
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,900
and placed at my feet.

530
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,700
You don't know to a certainty.

531
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:44,800
- In 20 minutes it could be here.
- I do know to a certainty.

532
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:47,500
And you know what's
gonna happen now, Carson?

533
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:53,200
You should admit your situation.
There would be more dignity in it.

534
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:01,200
You go to hell.

535
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:05,300
All right.
Let me ask you something.

536
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:11,900
If the rule you followed
brought you to this,

537
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,600
of what use was the rule?

538
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:24,000
Do you have any idea how crazy you are?

539
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,600
You mean the nature
of this conversation?

540
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:29,800
I mean the nature of you.

541
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:40,000
You... You can have the money, Anton.

542
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,400
- Hello?
- Yes?

543
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:27,300
Is, uh, Carson Wells there?

544
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:32,000
Not in the sense that you mean.

545
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:38,200
- You need to come see me.
- Who is this?

546
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:41,300
You know who it is.

547
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:44,500
- You need to talk to me.
- I don't need to talk to you.

548
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,900
I think you do.

549
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,700
Do you know where I'm going?

550
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:51,400
Why would I care where you're going?

551
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:54,100
I know where you are.

552
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:56,400
Yeah, where am I?

553
01:24:56,500 --> 01:25:00,700
You're in the hospital across the river,
but that's not where I'm going.

554
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,700
Do you know where I'm going?

555
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,600
- Yeah, I know where you're going.
- All right.

556
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:11,200
You know she won't be there.

557
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:13,800
It doesn't make any difference
where she is.

558
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:16,000
So, what're you going up there for?

559
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:22,200
You know how this is gonna turn out,
don't you?

560
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:25,700
Nope.

561
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:30,000
I think you do.
So this is what I'll offer.

562
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,600
You bring me the money,
and I'll let her go.

563
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:38,300
Otherwise, she's accountable,
the same as you.

564
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:42,900
That's the best deal you're gonna get.

565
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:46,900
I won't tell you you can save yourself,
because you can't.

566
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:53,600
Yeah, I'm gonna bring you something,
all right.

567
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,800
Decided to make you a project of mine.

568
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:58,500
You ain't gonna have
to come look for me at all.

569
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,400
- The motel in Del Rio?
- Yes, sir.

570
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:07,200
None of the three had ID on 'em,

571
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:11,100
but they're tellin' me that all three
is Mexican... was Mexicans.

572
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:16,000
There's a question,
whether they stopped being and when.

573
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Yes, sir.

574
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,600
Wendell, did you inquire
about the lock cylinder?

575
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:25,300
- Yes, sir. It was punched out.
- OK.

576
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:29,200
- Wanna drive out there?
- No, that's all I had to look for,

577
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:31,800
it sound like these boys
died of natural causes.

578
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:35,800
- How's that, sheriff?
- Natural to the line of work they in.

579
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:38,700
- Yes, sir.
- My God, Wendell, it's all-out war.

580
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:42,800
I can't think of any other word for it.
Who are these people?

581
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:46,300
Here, last week they found
this couple out in California.

582
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:50,100
They rent out rooms to old people,
kill 'em, bury 'em in the yard,

583
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:52,500
cash their Social Security checks.

584
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:56,700
Oh, they'd torture 'em first.
I don't know why.

585
01:26:57,900 --> 01:27:00,000
Maybe their television set was broke.

586
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:03,400
And this went on until, here, I quote,

587
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:07,400
"Neighbors were alerted
when a man ran from the premises

588
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:09,500
wearing only a dog collar."

589
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:14,200
You can't make up such
a thing as that. I dare you to try.

590
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:18,000
But that's what it took, you notice,
to get somebody's attention.

591
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,800
Digging graves in the backyard
didn't bring any.

592
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:31,200
Well, that's all right.
I laugh myself sometimes.

593
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:35,400
Ain't a whole lot else you can do.

594
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Tell me something.

595
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Who gets through this gate
into the United States?

596
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:47,300
I don't know. American citizens?

597
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:50,300
Some American citizens.
Who do you think decides?

598
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:52,400
- You do, I reckon.
- That is correct.

599
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,700
- How do I decide?
- I don't know.

600
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:58,800
I ask questions. If I get sensible
answers, then they get to go to America.

601
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,200
If I don't, they don't.

602
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:02,300
- Anything you don't understand?
- No.

603
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:05,100
I ask again, how you come
to be here with no clothes?

604
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:08,000
Well, I got an overcoat on.

605
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:11,200
- Are you jacking with me?
- No, sir.

606
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:13,400
- Don't jack with me.
- Yes, sir.

607
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,200
- You in the service?
- No, I'm a veteran.

608
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:18,700
- 'Nam?
- Yes, sir, two tours.

609
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,400
- What outfit?
- Twelfth Infantry Battalion,

610
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:25,000
August 7th, 1966, July 2nd, 1968.

611
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:30,700
- Wilson!
- Yes, sir!

612
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:34,300
Get someone to help this man.
He needs to get into town.

613
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:46,800
- How those Larry's holdin' up?
- Good, good.

614
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:49,400
- I need everything else.
- OK.

615
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,100
Have a lot of people come
in here without any clothes on?

616
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:55,500
No, sir. It's unusual.

617
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:12,000
- She don't want to talk to you.
- Yes, she does. Put her on.

618
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,600
- Do you know what time it is?
- I don't care,

619
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:16,900
and don't you hang up this phone.

620
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,200
Discombobulated
by a no-account son-in-law.

621
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:23,200
- Llewelyn?
- Hey, you.

622
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:26,400
- What should I do?
- You know what's going on?

623
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:30,200
I don't know. I had the sheriff here
from Terrell County. He...

624
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:33,600
- What'd you tell him?
- What did I know to tell him?

625
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:37,500
You're hurt, ain't you?

626
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,800
What makes you say that?

627
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:43,500
- I can hear it in your voice.
- It's falseness in his voice!

628
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:47,100
Look, I want you to meet me at
the Desert Sands Motel in El Paso.

629
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:49,700
I'm gonna give you the money,
put you on a plane.

630
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:52,200
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna
leave you in the lurch.

631
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:55,400
This works better. With you
gone and I don't have the money,

632
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:58,300
he can't touch me,
but I can sure touch him.

633
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:01,000
And after I find him,
I'll come and join you.

634
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:04,600
Find who?
What am I supposed to do with mother?

635
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:06,500
- She'll be all right.
- All right?

636
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:09,100
Be all right? I got the cancer!

637
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:11,200
Ain't nobody gonna bother her.

638
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:45,300
Hmm.

639
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:47,200
Who are you?

640
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,500
- Me?
- Yes.

641
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:55,700
Nobody.

642
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,500
Accounting.

643
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:01,400
He gave the Mexicans a receiver.

644
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:05,700
He feels...

645
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:09,400
He felt that the more people looking...

646
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:14,400
That's foolish.
You pick the one right tool.

647
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:15,900
I see.

648
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:20,400
Are you going to shoot me?

649
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:28,500
That depends.

650
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,400
Do you see me?

651
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:38,200
I always seen this
is what it'd come to.

652
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:42,500
- Three years ago, I pre-visioned it.
- It ain't three years we been married.

653
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:46,800
Three years ago I said
them very words, "no" and "good."

654
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:50,500
Here we are, 90 degree heat,

655
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:56,000
I got the cancer and look at this,
not even a home to go to.

656
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:59,500
We're going to El Paso, Texas.

657
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:02,800
You know how may people
I know in El Paso, Texas?

658
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:05,800
- No, ma'am.
- That's how many.

659
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:17,900
- I didn't see my prednisone.
- I put it in, Mama.

660
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,700
- Well, I didn't see it.
- Well, I put it in that one.

661
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:25,700
You just set there. I'll get tickets
and a cart for the bags.

662
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:27,900
You need help with the bags, madam?

663
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,900
Well, thank God, there is
one gentleman left in west Texas.

664
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:34,700
Yes, thank you.
I am old and I am not well!

665
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:39,500
- Which bus are you taking?
- Going to El Paso, don't ask me why.

666
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:42,500
It's not often you see
a Mexican in a suit.

667
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:45,100
You go to El Paso? I know it.
Where are you staying?

668
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:46,500
Oh...

669
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:48,300
Carla Jean, how are you?

670
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:52,400
Sheriff, was that a true story
about Charlie Walser?

671
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,900
Who's Charlie Walser? Uh! Oh...

672
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,100
Um...

673
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,700
True story.
I couldn't swear to every detail,

674
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:03,400
- but it's certainly true it is a story.
- Yeah, right.

675
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:07,300
Sheriff, can you give me
your word on something?

676
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:09,300
Yes, ma'am.

677
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:14,000
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed,
you promise it'll be just you

678
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,200
who goes and talks with him?
You and nobody else.

679
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:21,200
- Yes, ma'am, I do.
- Llewelyn would never ask for help.

680
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:24,100
He never thinks he needs any.

681
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:28,100
Carla Jean, I will not harm your man.

682
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:31,600
And he needs help,
whether he knows it or not.

683
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:42,700
What's the problem there, neighbor?

684
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:47,100
Yep, that'll suck some power, over time.

685
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:52,700
- You from around here?
- Yeah, Alpine, born and bred.

686
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:56,800
- Here you go.
- What airport would you use?

687
01:33:56,900 --> 01:34:01,100
- Well, airport or airstrip?
- Airport.

688
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:04,900
- Well, where you goin'?
- I don't know.

689
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:09,400
Just lightin' out for the territories,
huh? Brother, I been there.

690
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,200
Well, there's airstrips.

691
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:15,600
The airport is El Paso.

692
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:17,500
If you want someplace specific,

693
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:21,500
you might could be better off just
driving to Dallas, not have to connect.

694
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:23,800
You gonna clamp them, buddy?

695
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:26,800
Can you get those chicken crates
out of the bed?

696
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:29,700
What are you talking about?

697
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:49,600
Hey, Mr. Sportin' Goods.

698
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:53,700
- Hey, yourself.
- You a sport?

699
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:56,100
Yeah, that's me.

700
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:59,000
I got beers in my room.

701
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:03,000
- Oh, uh, I'm... I'm waiting on my wife.
- Oh.

702
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,900
That's who you keep
looking out the window for?

703
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:08,600
- Well, half.
- What else then?

704
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:13,500
- Just looking for what's comin'.
- Yeah.

705
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:16,300
But no one ever sees that.

706
01:35:16,300 --> 01:35:19,600
Beer! That's what's comin'.

707
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:22,500
I'll bring the ice chest out.
You can stay married.

708
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:25,100
No, ma'am, I know what beer leads to.

709
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:29,000
Beer leads to more beer.

710
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,400
You all right?

711
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:24,600
Call the police.

712
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,700
Your local law enforcement.

713
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
I'm not on their radio.

714
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:38,800
I met his daughter at the...

715
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:29,500
Buy you a cup of coffee
'fore you drive home?

716
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:33,100
- No money in his room there?
- Couple hundred, on his person.

717
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:35,500
Those hombres
would have taken the stash.

718
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:38,100
I suppose so.

719
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:40,400
Though they was leavin' in a hurry.

720
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:45,600
It's all the goddamn money, Ed Tom.
Money and the drugs.

721
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:49,500
It's just goddamn beyond everything.

722
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:53,400
What's it mean? What's it leading to?

723
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:56,600
You know,
if you'd have told me 20 years ago

724
01:37:56,700 --> 01:37:59,800
I'd see children walking
the streets of our Texas towns

725
01:37:59,900 --> 01:38:03,000
with green hair, bones in their noses,

726
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:05,600
I just flat-out
wouldn't have believed you.

727
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:07,300
Signs and wonders.

728
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:11,900
But I think once you quit hearing "sir"
and "ma'am," the rest is soon to foller.

729
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,700
- Oh, it's the tide.
- Yeah.

730
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:17,600
It's the dismal tide.
It is not the one thing.

731
01:38:17,700 --> 01:38:19,300
Not the one thing.

732
01:38:19,300 --> 01:38:22,200
Yeah, well,
none of that explains your man, though.

733
01:38:22,300 --> 01:38:25,400
Well, he's just a goddamn
homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.

734
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:28,800
- I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
- Well, what would you call him?

735
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:32,300
Well, sometimes
I think he's pretty much a ghost.

736
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:34,300
- He's real, all right.
- Oh, yeah?

737
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:38,100
Yeah. All of that over at
the Eagle Hotel? Just beyond everything.

738
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:40,800
Yeah. Got some hard bark on him.

739
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:43,700
Why... Well, that don't hardly say it.

740
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:46,800
He shoots a desk clerk one day,

741
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:51,300
walks right back in the next
and shoots a retired Army colonel.

742
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:52,900
It's hard to believe.

743
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:56,200
Just strolls right back
into a crime scene.

744
01:38:56,300 --> 01:39:01,700
Now, who'd do such a thing?
How do you defend against it?

745
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:04,700
Well, good trip, Ed Tom.

746
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:07,200
Sorry we couldn't help your boy.

747
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:42,600
- In back!
- How'd you know I was here?

748
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:45,700
Who else'd be driving up in your truck?

749
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:47,400
- You heard it?
- How's that?

750
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:51,600
Did you hear my...?
You're having fun with me.

751
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:56,100
What give you that idea?
I seen one of the cats heard it.

752
01:42:56,200 --> 01:43:01,000
- How'd you know it was my truck?
- I deduced it when you walked in.

753
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,200
How many of them things you got now?

754
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:05,800
Cats? Oh, I don't know, several.

755
01:43:05,900 --> 01:43:09,200
Well, it depends
on what you mean by "got."

756
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:13,500
Some of 'em are half wild,
some of 'em are just outlaws.

757
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:20,300
- How you been, Ellis?
- You're looking at it.

758
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:24,900
I got to say, you're looking older.

759
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,500
I am older.

760
01:43:27,700 --> 01:43:30,200
Got a letter from your wife.

761
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:34,700
She writes me pretty regular,
keeps me up on the family news.

762
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:38,400
- Didn't know there was any.
- Told me you're quittin'.

763
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:44,400
- You want a cup?
- Appreciate it.

764
01:43:51,900 --> 01:43:53,700
How fresh is that coffee?

765
01:43:53,800 --> 01:43:59,500
I generally make a fresh pot every week,
even if there's some left over.

766
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:03,800
That man that shot you died in prison?

767
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:08,400
Angola. Yeah.

768
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:11,300
What'd you done he'd a been released?

769
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:14,300
Oh, I don't know. Nothing.

770
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:16,000
Wouldn't be no point in it.

771
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,300
Kindly surprised to hear you say that.

772
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:23,100
Well, all the time
you spend trying to get back

773
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:26,800
what's been took from you,
more is going out the door.

774
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:29,900
After a while, you have
to try to get a tourniquet on it.

775
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:35,100
Your granddad never asked me
to sign on as a deputy.

776
01:44:37,900 --> 01:44:41,900
Loretta tells me you're quittin'.
How come you doing that?

777
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,300
I don't know.

778
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,700
I feel overmatched.

779
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:55,800
I always figured when I got older,

780
01:44:55,900 --> 01:45:00,800
God would... sort of
come into my life somehow.

781
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:04,900
And He didn't.

782
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:10,400
And I don't blame Him.

783
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:15,700
If I was Him, I'd have
the same opinion of me that He does.

784
01:45:16,300 --> 01:45:18,100
You don't know what He thinks.

785
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:36,100
I sent Uncle Mac's thumbbuster and badge
over to the Rangers,

786
01:45:36,100 --> 01:45:38,800
put it in their museum.

787
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:42,500
Your daddy ever tell you
how Uncle Mac come to his reward?

788
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:47,100
Gunned down on his own porch
over in Hudspeth County.

789
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:54,200
Seven or eight of 'em come up there,
all wanting this, wanting that.

790
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:57,300
Uncle Mac went back in the house
to get the shotgun.

791
01:45:57,300 --> 01:46:01,000
Well, they was ahead of him.

792
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,800
Shot him in his doorway.

793
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:06,400
Aunt Ella come out,
tried to stop the bleeding.

794
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:10,400
Uncle Mac all the while
trying to get that shotgun.

795
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:15,000
They just sat there on their horses,
watching him die.

796
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:20,200
After a while, one of 'em said
something in Indian and they turned.

797
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:22,900
Left out.

798
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:28,600
Uncle Mac knew the score,
even if Aunt Ella didn't.

799
01:46:28,700 --> 01:46:31,800
Shot through the left lung.

800
01:46:31,900 --> 01:46:36,400
And that was that... as they say.

801
01:46:39,700 --> 01:46:41,000
When'd he die?

802
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:45,600
Nineteen zero and, uh... nine?

803
01:46:45,700 --> 01:46:49,500
No, I mean,
was it right away or in the night or...

804
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:53,300
- When was it?
- I believe it was that night.

805
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:58,400
She buried him the next morning.
Digging in that hard old caliche.

806
01:47:01,300 --> 01:47:04,100
What you got ain't nothin' new.

807
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:07,900
This country is hard on people.

808
01:47:11,700 --> 01:47:13,800
You can't stop what's coming.

809
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,700
It ain't all waitin' on you.

810
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:22,400
That's vanity.

811
01:48:23,300 --> 01:48:25,700
I knew this wasn't done with.

812
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:30,400
I ain't got the money.

813
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:36,700
What little I had is long gone
and there's bills aplenty to pay yet.

814
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:43,200
I buried my mother today.
Ain't paid for that neither.

815
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:46,000
I wouldn't worry about it.

816
01:48:48,700 --> 01:48:50,200
I need to sit down.

817
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:07,600
You got no cause to hurt me.

818
01:49:07,700 --> 01:49:11,500
No. But I gave my word.

819
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:16,600
- You gave your word?
- To your husband.

820
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:22,400
That don't make sense.

821
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:25,700
You gave your word
to my husband to kill me?

822
01:49:25,700 --> 01:49:29,200
Your husband had
the opportunity to save you.

823
01:49:29,300 --> 01:49:32,200
Instead, he used you
to try to save himself.

824
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:39,200
Not like that.

825
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:42,600
Not like you say.

826
01:49:48,700 --> 01:49:50,500
You don't have to do this.

827
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:52,800
People always say the same thing.

828
01:49:54,500 --> 01:49:55,800
What do they say?

829
01:49:56,900 --> 01:49:59,100
They say, "You don't have to do this."

830
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:05,400
- You don't.
- OK.

831
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:12,500
This is the best I can do.

832
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:14,600
Call it.

833
01:50:19,100 --> 01:50:22,700
I knowed you was crazy
when I saw you sitting there.

834
01:50:25,100 --> 01:50:27,700
I knowed exactly
what was in store for me.

835
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:32,100
- Call it.
- No.

836
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:34,700
I ain't gonna call it.

837
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:39,500
Call it.

838
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:42,600
The coin don't have no say.

839
01:50:42,700 --> 01:50:44,600
It's just you.

840
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:50,200
Well, I got here
the same way the coin did.

841
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:36,000
Mister, you got
a bone sticking out of your arm.

842
01:52:36,100 --> 01:52:38,500
I'm all right.
Let me just sit here a minute.

843
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:41,500
There's an ambulance coming.
The man went to call.

844
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:43,800
All right.

845
01:52:43,900 --> 01:52:47,700
Are you all right?
You got a bone sticking out your arm.

846
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
What'll you take for the shirt?

847
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:58,500
Well, hell, mister,
I'll give you my shirt.

848
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:09,000
Look at that fucking bone.

849
01:53:09,100 --> 01:53:10,200
Tie this for me.

850
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:13,300
Just tie it, just tie it.

851
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:35,300
Hell, mister.
Look, I don't mind helping someone out.

852
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:37,900
- That's a lot of money.
- Take it.

853
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:41,100
Take it and... you didn't see me.

854
01:53:41,200 --> 01:53:43,500
I was already gone.

855
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:44,800
Yes, sir.

856
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:52,800
- Part of that's mine, right?
- You still got your damn shirt.

857
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:57,200
- Ain't even what it was for.
- Maybe. But I'm still out a shirt.

858
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:20,000
- Maybe I'll go ridin'.
- OK.

859
01:54:20,100 --> 01:54:23,900
- What do you think?
- Well, I can't plan your day.

860
01:54:25,200 --> 01:54:28,700
- I mean, would you care to join me?
- Lord, no, I'm not retired.

861
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:35,200
- Maybe I'll help out here then.
- Uh... better not.

862
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:42,800
- How'd you sleep?
- I don't know. Had dreams.

863
01:54:42,900 --> 01:54:47,300
Well, you got time for 'em now.
Anything interesting?

864
01:54:47,300 --> 01:54:50,200
They always is to the party concerned.

865
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:55,000
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.

866
01:54:57,400 --> 01:55:02,500
All right, then. Two of 'em, both
had my father in 'em. It's peculiar.

867
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:05,600
I'm older now
than he ever was by 20 years.

868
01:55:05,700 --> 01:55:09,500
So, in a sense, he's the younger man.

869
01:55:09,600 --> 01:55:12,700
Anyway, the first one
I don't remember too well,

870
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:15,500
but it was about meeting him in town,

871
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:18,200
somewheres,
and he give me some money.

872
01:55:18,300 --> 01:55:19,900
I think I lost it.

873
01:55:21,700 --> 01:55:26,600
Second one, it was like we
was both back in older times.

874
01:55:26,700 --> 01:55:30,800
And I was a-horseback,
going through the mountains of a night.

875
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:34,300
Going through this pass
in the mountains.

876
01:55:34,300 --> 01:55:37,700
It was cold,
and there was snow on the ground.

877
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:40,300
And he rode past me and kept on going,

878
01:55:40,300 --> 01:55:43,100
never said nothing going by,
just rode on past.

879
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:48,600
He had his blanket wrapped around him
and his head down.

880
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:54,400
When he rode past,
I seen he was carrying fire in a horn,

881
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:56,300
the way people used to do, and I...

882
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:59,000
I could see the horn
from the light inside of it,

883
01:55:59,100 --> 01:56:00,800
'bout the color of the moon.

884
01:56:02,300 --> 01:56:04,600
And, in the dream, I knew that he was...

885
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:07,300
...going on ahead.

886
01:56:07,900 --> 01:56:12,800
He was fixin' to make a fire somewhere
out there in all that dark and cold.

887
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:19,400
And I knew that whenever I got there,
he'd be there.

888
01:56:23,900 --> 01:56:25,900
And then I woke up.
