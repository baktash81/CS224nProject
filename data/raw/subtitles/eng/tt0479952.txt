1
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:28,524
Well done, boys.
Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast.

2
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,507
No, no, son.
Over here.

3
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,114
See the lion?
Look at the lion and get the lion.

4
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,621
Now, son, if you're gonna grow up

5
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:04,060
and be like your daddy someday,
you gotta learn how to fight.

6
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,728
Da-da.

7
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:11,007
Now, Alakay, let me show
you something, OK?

8
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,898
You see this mark?

9
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,401
You and me are the same.

10
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,973
When you're bigger,
you'll be Alpha Lion, just like your daddy.

11
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:21,808
Now let me see you fight. Ready?

12
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,580
No, Alakay. No dancing!

13
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,519
You just amuse yourself, don't you?

14
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:32,354
You're a strange kid.
You're a strange one. I'm...

15
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,689
Now, come on, let's try it again.

16
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,661
No, Alakay.

17
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:39,197
Stop that right now. Doggone it!

18
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:42,701
It's so disappointing when they
don't grow up the way you want them to.

19
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:46,170
Makunga. You're not
challenging me again, are you?

20
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,642
Look on the bright side, Zuba. After I defeat
you and take over as alpha lion,

21
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,838
you'll have more time to spend
with your pathetic excuse of a son.

22
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,214
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you:

23
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,879
Why do you want
to become the alpha lion?

24
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:05,220
I'm better looking, I have better hair,
I'm deceivingly smart...

25
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,623
...and I want everyone else
to do what I say.

26
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,962
We fight on three. One...

27
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:16,132
Pay attention, Alakay.
Daddy will show you how it's done.

28
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,800
Two, three!

29
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,758
- Who's the alpha lion?
- You are.

30
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,824
Don't you forget it.

31
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,999
And that, Alakay, is how you attack...

32
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,461
Alakay?

33
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:59,334
That's it. Here, kitty, kitty.

34
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,241
This one's a beauty.

35
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,574
He'll be worth a few bucks.

36
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,846
It just gets easier and easier.

37
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,118
Daddy!

38
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,182
Alakay! Alakay!

39
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,593
Alakay!

40
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,190
Da-da!

41
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,691
No! No! No!

42
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:26,863
Alakay!

43
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,610
- Daddy!
- Alakay, daddy's got you! Hold on!

44
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,049
Da-da!

45
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,732
Alakay!

46
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,248
Daddy!

47
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,166
<i># I've been around the world
in the pouring rain # </i>

48
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:39,609
<i> # Feeling out of place
really feeling strange # </i>

49
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,671
<i> # Take me to a place

50
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:46,048

00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,213

Lion out of the jungle # </i>

00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,918
<i> # He's a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle # </i>

53
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:56,120
<i> # I'm a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle # </i>

00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:59,289

Lion out of the jungle # </i>

55
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,732

Take me to my peoples # </i>

56
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:06,535

57
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,631

00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,142

00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:18,980

00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:22,488

00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:25,922
<i> # See I been traveling

64
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,325
- I don't like the looks of this guy.
- Well, I think he's kind of cute.

65
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,590
I think he's kind of a showoff.

66
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,996
You think he's cute?

67
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,343
Roar!!

68
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,011
<i>The King of New York City...</i>

69
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,185
<i>...Alex the Lion!</i>

70
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,417
I still think he's kind of a showoff.

71
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,556
You gotta give it to him.
The guy's an animal.

72
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:04,619
Maybe he should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.

73
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,688
Come on, where on earth
would we go on vacation?

74
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:10,299
I don't know about you,
but I want to go to Connecticut!

75
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:14,563
On the loose, several animals, including
the world famous Alex the Lion,

76
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,734
The King of New York, escaped from
the Central Park Zoo tonight.

77
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,041
The escapees were finally cornered
in Grand Central Station.

78
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,214
He was a very bad kitty.

79
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,246
Animal rights activists,
who convinced zoo officials

80
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,584
to have the escaped animals sent to Africa,

81
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:32,988
were stunned to learnthat the
shipping freighter carrying the animals

82
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,651
was reported missing today.

83
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,823
Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers
have gathered at the Central Park Zoo

84
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,492
to mourn the loss
of their beloved zoo animals.

85
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:45,526
The question on everyone's mind,
where are they now?

86
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,110
<i> # I like to move it, move it # </i>

87
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,046
<i> # He likes to move it, move it # </i>

88
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,050
<i> # She likes to move it, move it # </i>

89
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,814
<i>-  # We like to
- Move it! # </i>

90
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:39,381
Come on! Y'all know this one!
It never gets stale!

91
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:41,117
<i>-  # We like to
- Move it! # </i>

92
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:44,652
We'll miss you little fuzz buckets!
You guys have been a great crowd!

93
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,130
Glad we could introduce
you to the toilet.

94
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,294
If you ever come look us up in
Manhattan, feel free to call first.

95
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,966
Seriously though, call. OK?

96
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,072
Alright settle down, everybody,
settle down. Be quiet!

97
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,168
You can't leave without this!

98
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,540
Surprise, freaks!

99
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,307
Shake it! Shake it.

100
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:09,213
Look, I'm a lady! I'm a lady, everyone!

101
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,653
I'm a lady! Not really!
It's me, King Julien!

102
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,895
Which of you is attracted to me?
Hands up!

103
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,994
Hey, freaks! You will be very glad
to hear that I am coming with you.

104
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,663
Oh, no, thank you.

105
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:32,009
Yes, thank you. It's my plane!

106
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:37,009
Until I return with the spoils
from the new country...

107
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,183
...Stevie will be in charge!

108
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,019
I don't think they like that idea
so much, Julien.

109
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,351
What is that you're saying, Stevie?

110
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,288
No.

111
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:56,802
Could we? No, you didn't say that!
How is that even possible?

112
00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:00,737
Naughty little thing! Stevie says...

113
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,807
Let them eat cake!

114
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,810
King Julien, wait for me!

115
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:09,143
I'm all packed! I have
a whole itinerary planned!

116
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,211
Oh, no! It's Mort! He's so annoying!

117
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,453
Don't let him on. Stop that thing!

118
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,546
He's carrying scissors and hand cream!

119
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,553
Everybody in! Quickly, get in, get in!
Get in quick!

120
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,095
- Struts.
- Check.

121
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:27,254
- Flaps.
- Check.

122
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:28,923
- Engine. Coffee maker.
- Check.

123
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,063
You guys!

124
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,569
Oopsie-daisy!

125
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,576
That's got to be the second biggest
slingshot I've ever seen.

126
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,074
But it's gonna have to do. Attention.

127
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,749
This is your captain speaking.

128
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,976
In the event of a water emergency,
place the vest over your head

129
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,915
then kiss your... good-bye.

130
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,188
New York City, here we come!

131
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,988
Pray to your personal God
this hunk of junk flies.

132
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,195
Personal God, hunk? What?

133
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,587
We are go, sir.

134
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,766
Open the door! I'm outside!

135
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,763
In case of the loss of cabin pressure,

136
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:08,531
place the mask over your face to hide your
terrified expression from the other passengers.

137
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:12,767
Excuse me miss, aren't these supposed
to be attached to my seat?

138
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,277
- No, sir.
- OK, boys, launch!

139
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,913
Launch!

140
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,110
- Launch!
- Launch!

141
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,486
Aah! Gremlin!

142
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,328
Hey, Mort.

143
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,592
Hi!

144
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:13,727
That was weird.

145
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:17,067
- Hey, somebody's dreaming, huh.
- I think I just saw Mort on the wing of the plane.

146
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,174
You got Madagascar on the brain.

147
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:20,777
I know I'm gonna miss it.

148
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:25,215
It was incredible. I think it'll seem
more fun the further we are from it.

149
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:26,945
Like when you bit me on the butt?

150
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:31,456
I'm gonna take that thing you're
holding onto and use it onstage.

151
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:35,290
It's all part of my little actor's salad
bar of emotional tidbits.

152
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,190
Are the butts next to the
croutons on the salad bar?

153
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,162
You don't need to be sarcastic, Marty.

154
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,670
Hey guys, you know, I was thinking...

155
00:11:42,634 --> 00:11:45,971
When we get back, I might just
sign up for the breeding program.

156
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,096
Breeding program?

157
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:50,301
I think we all reach a point in our lives
when we want to meet somebody.

158
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,810
You know, settle down, have a relationship.

159
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,004
I can see that.

160
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,345
What? Like dating?

161
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,974
Yeah, dating.

162
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,576
Other... other guys?

163
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,883
What do you mean, other guys?

164
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,725
Darn it!

165
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,888
I'm gonna... What is holding up
that beverage service?!

166
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,064
I'm gonna go check.

167
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,595
You all keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few winks.

168
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,572
Did you see that,
that's so funny!

169
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,610
I like laughing!
It's such a nice experience!

170
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,907
To laugh!

171
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,619
Whoa !

172
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,742
Do you mind going back?
This is first class.

173
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,621
It's nothing personal. It's just we're better
than you. Hey Maurice, I'm open! Hit me!

174
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,058
- He shoots, he scores!
- Is that Vivaldi?

175
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,858
- In-flight slave.
- Can I help you, Mr. Mankiewicz?

176
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,626
Bring my nuts on a silver platter.

177
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,827
We just wanted to check on
the drinks we ordered.

178
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,093
So sorry. Been a little backed up.

179
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,736
- I guess I'll go back to...
- What happened to your body?

180
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:59,311
You're freaking me out!
Can you please go over there, please?

181
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:02,574
What happened to
the separation of the classes?

182
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,448
I'm sure this democracy thing
is just a fad.

183
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,952
We'll go out for pineapple,
my bobbly-headed boobily-boo.

184
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,520
Skipper, look.

185
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,318
Analysis.

186
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:14,956
It looks like a small incandescent bulb

187
00:13:14,986 --> 00:13:17,586
designed to indicate something out of
the ordinary, like a malfunction.

188
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,825
I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.

189
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:20,888
That too, sir.

190
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,297
Right! Rico?

191
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:23,524
Manual!

192
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,397
Problemo solved.

193
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,805
- Sir, we may be out of fuel.
- What makes you think that?

194
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,542
We've lost engine one...

195
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,306
...and engine two is no longer on fire.

196
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,140
Buckle up, boys.

197
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,743
Don't look, doll. This might get hairy.

198
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,317
Attention! This is your captain speaking.

199
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:43,982
I've got good and bad news.

200
00:13:43,987 --> 00:13:46,237
The good news is,
we'll be landing immediately.

201
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,317
The bad news is, we're crash-landing.

202
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,263
When it comes to air travel,
we know you have no choice what so ever.

203
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,325
But thanks again for choosing Air Penguin.

204
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:13,182
Raise your arms, Maurice!
It's more fun when you raise your arms like this!

205
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,853
I can fly!

206
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:22,787
This could be it, Marty! I just want you to
know you are truly a one-in-a-million friend!

207
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,922
Thanks, buddy! You're the best ever!

208
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,565
- I know you won't mind when I tell you...
- Tell me anything! Tell me what?

209
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,432
I broke your iPod!

210
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:34,199
- What ?
- The buttons were so small! It made me mad!

211
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:36,537
- The horror!
- I'm sorry!

212
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,470
- I'm gonna kill you, butt-biter!
- It was an accident!

213
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,269
- An accident!
- Butt-biter!

214
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,379
I love you, Gloria! I always have!

215
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:55,550
Like you love the beach.
Or a good book. Or the beach.

216
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,230
My goodness, doll,
you're shaking like a leaf.

217
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,236
Rico, you've had your fun.

218
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,568
Pull up.

219
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,169
Gear down.

220
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,315
Gently. You just want
to kiss the ground.

221
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,248
Just a peck, a smooch,
like you're kissing your sister.

222
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,380
I said, kiss it!

223
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,532
Now just a little brake. Just a touch.
A little whisper.

224
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,267
I believe that's checkmate.

225
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,935
Commence emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up! Deploy!

226
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,994
Oh, we're here.

227
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,826
What in the world?

228
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:13,605
What happened to the plane?
What did y'all do to the plane?

229
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:16,106
I'm OK. I'm alive.

230
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:20,202
I can't even sleep for a minute.
And you know what? This is not JFK.

231
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,304
Kowalski, casualty report.

232
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,348
Only two passengers unaccounted for, Skipper.

233
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:27,346
That's a number I can live with.
Good landing, boys.

234
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,019
Who says a penguin can't fly?

235
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:35,086
Hey, happy slappers! Is there some
reason to celebrate? Look at the plane!

236
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,795
- We'll fix it.
- Fix it? How are you gonna fix this?

237
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:40,696
Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape.

238
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:44,730
We should be up and running
in, say, six to nine months.

239
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:47,738
- Sixty-nine months?!
- No, six to nine months.

240
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,536
Kowalski, I say we use
this setback to our advantage.

241
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:54,872
- Where'd you pull that number out of?
- I want you to reconfigure the design.

242
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,638
How do you estimate that?

243
00:16:56,882 --> 00:17:00,283
You! Pretty boy! Why don't you and
your friends dig a latrine. Maybe find water.

244
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:03,514
Hold on a second. Who made you king
of the plane wreck?

245
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:07,992
Excuse me? Fine. You can be in charge.
You fix the plane.

246
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,426
Who gives you the authority
to put me in charge?

247
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,555
OK, then I'll remain in charge.

248
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,493
Yeah, you will remain in charge.

249
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,228
You and your hippie friends
stay out of our hair.

250
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:20,135
Correcto-mundo. Because I decided to.

251
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:24,073
- Good for you.
- Well, guess what? This discussion isn't over.

252
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,476
Higher mammals! You stay with us.

253
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,571
We could use your front cortexes
and opposable thumbs.

254
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:33,578
Phil! I should wash
your hands out with soap.

255
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,355
How in the hell-o
are they fix this plane?!

256
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:40,415
You know, grit and spit and spit.

257
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,359
A lot of spit and grit and
stick-to-it-iveness.

258
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,693
That don't sound too promising.

259
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:48,289
You're right. We're stuck here.

260
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:52,360
Hey guys, as long as we're together,
we'll be OK.

261
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,703
Yeah, but love ain't gonna get us home.

262
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:58,106
Behold! The lion!

263
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,804
- Hey people!
- There is much to see. Moving on.

264
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,280
Wait, wait, wait! People!

265
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,115
- They'll help us!
- Wait up!

266
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,944
- People! Stop!
- Help us!

267
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:13,618
Hey wait.
If you stop, I'll autograph those!

268
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,223
I know you!

269
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:17,353
You.

270
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,454
It's that bad kitty.

271
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,465
How do you like some of that?!

272
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,655
Come in, Tokyo!

273
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:58,834
Right in the batteries.

274
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,766
You think an old lady
can't take care of herself?

275
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:05,109
Next time, I won't go so easy on you!

276
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,572
Thank you, dear.

277
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:09,177
Moving on!

278
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,700
Are you out of your mind?

279
00:19:12,713 --> 00:19:15,683
We need their help and you're
harassing little old ladies?!

280
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,912
Out of my mind?

281
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,848
Who's out of my mind now?

282
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,292
- See if you can get an operator.
- No problem.

283
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:26,695
Out of my mind. We're going home.

284
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,370
<i>Message E-4.</i>

285
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:43,274
<i>The service user has roamed
outside the coverage area.</i>

286
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,881
<i>Please try again later.</i>

287
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,504
Oh my... Whoa...

288
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:51,887
Am I trippin'?

289
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,391
All those zebras... like me.

290
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:59,057
- Wait a minute. Where are we?
- San Diego.

291
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,730
This time I'm 40 percent sure.

292
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:04,399
- I know this place.
- I think it's Africa.

293
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:05,625
Africa?

294
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,235
It's got to be.

295
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:10,064
Our ancestral crib.

296
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,504
It's in our blood. I can feel it!

297
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:15,235
No, it's more than that. It's like...

298
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:18,414
...déjà vu, like I've been here before.

299
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,242
It's like Roots!

300
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:21,986
No, it's like...

301
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:25,417
...déjà vu, like I've been here before.

302
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:27,756
How!

303
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:31,927
How!

304
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,428
Me Alex!

305
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,932
Me and me friends fly,

306
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:44,265
fly in great metal bird.

307
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,938
Then plummet!

308
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:50,278
Smash ground!

309
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,779
Go boom!

310
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:57,111
Then here we emerge.

311
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:00,482
We offer only happiness

312
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,220
and good greetings.

313
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,623
Is he dancing about a plane crash?

314
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,129
Yeah. We just... yeah.

315
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,128
I thought... Sorry.

316
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,363
You came from off the reserve?

317
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:15,471
Yeah, way off.
From the Central Park Zoo, actually.

318
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:24,805
Don't strain yourself.

319
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,245
What's going on here?
What's all this hubbub?

320
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:30,083
They say they're from off the reserve.

321
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:33,522
That's impossible. Only people
come from off the reserve.

322
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,753
You look familiar. Do I know you?

323
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,352
How could you possibly
survive the hunters?

324
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,762
Hunters? We didn't see any hunters.

325
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,697
- What are you looking at?
- Me? Nothing.

326
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:45,931
This watering hole doesn't need
any more mouths to feed.

327
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:48,503
So skedaddle back to
where ever you came from.

328
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,935
OKay, is there maybe like a
manager we could talk to?

329
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:54,077
Oh I see. You're here to challenge me!

330
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,836
What? No! No.

331
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,742
That's what it's starting
to look like to me!

332
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:59,347
Zuba! Wait.

333
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,347
I'm trying to take care of business...

334
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,082
Yeah, yeah, Zuba. Hold on.

335
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:06,087
Alakay?

336
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:08,189
Is that you?

337
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:11,760
No, it's Alex. lx. Like New York Knicks.

338
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,123
Zuba, look!

339
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:17,191
I've always had that.
The vet checked it out.

340
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,527
It's kind of a beauty spot, really.

341
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,299
A mark.

342
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:24,869
All right, this is a little weird.

343
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:28,038
Honey, he's come home.

344
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,074
What?

345
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,046
You've come home.

346
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:41,450
Son.

347
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:48,722
Dad.

348
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:53,837
Mom and Dad? Mom and Dad!

349
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:57,238
Mom and Dad! It's my mom and dad!

350
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,804
I got a mom and dad!

351
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:01,409
My baby's alive!

352
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,011
Dad!

353
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:04,909
My son!

354
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:08,246
My son is home!

355
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:13,249
Alakay! Alakay has come home!

356
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:21,759
Alakay! Yeah! The prodigal son returns.
This is perfect!

357
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,260
I thought you hated Zuba.

358
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:29,036
Oh, I do. I do. I do.
I hate him. Oh, I do.

359
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:31,632
And I'm going to use Alakay, yes.

360
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,271
I'm going to use him
to get rid of Zuba once and for all!

361
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,106
Giddy-up, feathered horse!

362
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:40,049
Make way!
Move out of the way! Stand aside!

363
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:41,779
New York!

364
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,056
It's a bit of a dump.
Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?

365
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:49,389
Hello, New Yorkers!
Your new king is here!

366
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,725
This calls for a celebration!

367
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,662
Maurice, I think they like me.

368
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:56,292
You've got to love
a non-hostile takeover!

369
00:23:58,136 --> 00:23:59,626
Chukka-chukka what?

370
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:10,207
Excuse me. I'm Marty.
I'm kind of new around here.

371
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:12,743
Hey, Marty!

372
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,000
Hey.

373
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:19,220
You're a good-looking group!
You like to run?

374
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,992
Yeah. Running is crack-a-lackin'.

375
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,761
That's right! Crack-a-lackin'.

376
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,856
You guys are speaking
my crack-a-lackin' language.

377
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:30,367
What? You don't have doctors here?

378
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:31,925
Not anymore.

379
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:34,494
Well, what if you catch a cold?

380
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:37,667
We go over to the dying holes
and we die.

381
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,409
OKay, you guys really
need a doctor.

382
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,678
- Hey, we have an opening.
- Would you be interested?

383
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,241
Me? A doctor?

384
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:56,522
It's raining men. Hallelujah!
You all got it going on.

385
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:59,621
How come you don't have
a man in your life? You got worms?

386
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:02,222
Oh, I got rid of those. Listen, girls.

387
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:05,395
Manhattan is short on two things,
parking and hippos.

388
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,598
Hey, everybody!
I just found out that my son

389
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:12,609
is a doggone king!
The King of New York!

390
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:17,411
Show me some of your moves, son.
Come on, don't be bashful.

391
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:20,144
All right. This one
always knocks 'em dead.

392
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:22,077
Roar!

393
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:26,214
Look out. The King is mad.
The King is mad!

394
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:31,160
Now let's all welcome him back
into the pride with open arms!

395
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,664
Welcome to the herd, Marty!

396
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:40,102
Me? In the herd? I've always
wanted to be part of a herd!

397
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:43,504
- It's one for all...
- [all] And all for all, y'all!

398
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,641
How do I look?

399
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:51,906
Technically, a traditional witch doctor
has a bone through his nose.

400
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:54,583
Don't worry... it's just a clip-on.

401
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:57,316
Voilà! He's a witch doctor!

402
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:59,988
My mother will be so happy.

403
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:07,992
Look out! I think Moto Moto likes you.

404
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:11,766
Here he comes.

405
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:16,337
<i>I like 'em big</i>

406
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,775
<i>I like 'em chunky</i>

407
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:22,944
<i>I like 'em big
I like 'em plumpy</i>

408
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:26,711
<i>I like 'em round
With somethin' somethin'</i>

409
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:30,016
<i>They like my sound
They think I'm funky</i>

410
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,454
Goodness, girl... you huge.

411
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,784
Who's your friend? Or is that your butt?

412
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:38,218
Girl, you as quick as you are hefty.

413
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:40,863
So you're Moto Moto?

414
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,127
The name's so nice, you say it twice.

415
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,029
I kind of like it, fatso.

416
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:49,301
I'll see you around, girl. It won't
be hard, because you so... plumpy.

417
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:57,706
Oops!

418
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,050
I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba,

419
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,586
but some of the other lions were wondering
when you were going to banish your son.

420
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:10,090
- What are you talking about, Makunga?
- It's nothing, really.

421
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:12,789
They're griping about how Alakay
never went through

422
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,957
the rite of passage,
blah, blah, blah,

423
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:20,437
so technically speaking, he can't be
a member of the pride. It's nonsense.

424
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,803
I had forgotten about the rite of passage.

425
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:25,138
What is it? What's this rite of passage?

426
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,735
It's a traditional coming-of-age ceremony.

427
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:31,540
Young lions earn their manes
by demonstrating their skills.

428
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:35,347
- Sort of a show-of-skill talent show type of deal?
- Yeah. Strutting their stuff.

429
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,548
Great! A performance!
I think that's up my alley.

430
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:42,457
If it's tradition, I want to do it.
Strut my stuff. Earn my mane.

431
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,290
I want to be Alaki.

432
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:46,694
- Alakay.
- Alakay! Even better.

433
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:49,359
We will hold the rite of passage
first thing in the morning!

434
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:52,130
That's wonderful! Good luck, Alakay.

435
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:54,467
Where I'm from, we say, "Break a leg."

436
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,700
That's my boy!

437
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:05,912
<i>I'm a private dancer</i>

438
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,452
<i>A dancer for money</i>

439
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:18,385
<i>Any old music will do</i>

440
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:23,063
Beautiful, isn't it?

441
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,125
It's amazing.

442
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,335
Guys...

443
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:30,064
...this is where we belong.

444
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,142
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.

445
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:36,277
Oh, I like that one. That's a good one.

446
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:38,076
It works on many levels.

447
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:39,946
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.

448
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:41,508
- That, too.
- Absolutely.

449
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:43,417
Stations.

450
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:45,479
Stage one. Go!

451
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:02,029
Oh, no! What have I done?

452
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:03,604
Come on, take the bait.

453
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,303
- What happened?
- Oh, look at the poor little guy.

454
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:07,935
Is it dead?

455
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,173
Stage two! Go, go, go!

456
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:21,385
I will give him the kiss of life.

457
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:24,050
Rico!

458
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:29,094
Rico!

459
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:32,667
Reverse!

460
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:33,726
Gas!

461
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,067
Music!

462
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,466
No! Stop! Stop!

463
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:41,409
Stop!

464
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:42,977
Come back!

465
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,745
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?!

466
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:55,089
Is she dead?

467
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:56,883
No!

468
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,903
You hoodlums!

469
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:10,772
Good heavens! Are you OK?

470
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:14,039
Lady, I found your pocketbook.

471
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:17,843
My handbag. Such a good boy.

472
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,111
Nana can't survive without it.

473
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:22,342
Wow, you are one tough cookie.

474
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:25,420
Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers.

475
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:29,290
OK, nobody panic! The best thing
we can do is stay together.

476
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,955
We'll wait for another tour jeep.
It may take hours, and it's getting dark but...

477
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,123
Where are you going?

478
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:38,695
I'm not gonna staying out here
to be attacked by more animals!

479
00:30:38,701 --> 00:30:40,801
I'm too old to die.

480
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:44,466
I dunno about you guys, but I'm going with her.
Old lady, wait up!

481
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:47,276
Please! We need to stay...

482
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:49,143
...together.

483
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:52,272
Fine! We'll go that way!

484
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,949
Does anyone want a hard candy?

485
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:01,152
- Easy now.
- Watch your step.

486
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:05,626
And this, right here...
OK, are you ready?

487
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:09,896
This is where you always slept.

488
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,629
Oh, man!

489
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:18,964
- Was this mine?
- Look at you. Look at him, honey.

490
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:22,406
Oh, this thing. Look, look!

491
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:25,313
- I remember this!
- He remembers.

492
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:27,306
A little harder than...

493
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:31,316
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.

494
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,316
Is that?

495
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:34,989
Is that my?

496
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,326
Is that me?

497
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:41,093
You had the cutest little paws.

498
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:43,664
Little, little bitty ol' paws.

499
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:46,664
You did that the day we lost you.

500
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:50,668
Wow. I was so young.

501
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:52,707
What happened to me?

502
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:57,205
It was all my fault.
I turned my back and...

503
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,273
It was not your fault.

504
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:04,544
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.

505
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:06,220
Far off the reserve.

506
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:09,551
Finally, I had to assume the hunters...

507
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:11,017
...well...

508
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:14,695
We thought they'd killed you.

509
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:19,367
But my son fought those hunters off!
Don't mess with the King of New York!

510
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:21,127
- That's right!
- Keep your chin in.

511
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:25,570
Alright, you boys be careful!
Watch out before you break something.

512
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:29,843
You used to call this "foofie."

513
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:31,404
"Foofie"?

514
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,649
Foofie.

515
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,242
He doesn't want that thing.

516
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,912
This is my foofie!

517
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,916
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.

518
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:46,259
I mean, no, thank you,
thank you. It's perfect.

519
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:49,930
Son, you get your rest.
You have a big day tomorrow.

520
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,429
You're gonna need all your strength.

521
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:54,937
I am gonna bring the house down
for you, dad.

522
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:59,001
I hope so. Otherwise,
your father will have to banish you.

523
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,077
Jeez, Mom, really?

524
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:04,338
I know you'll do us proud. You know why?

525
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,282
You were born with it.

526
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,278
Good night, Alakay.

527
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:14,284
My boy. My own boy.

528
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,626
My son's a king.

529
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,629
My son's a king.

530
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:33,300
Good night, Mom.

531
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,303
Good night, Alakay.

532
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:44,454
Foofie.

533
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:47,321
Look at foofie! My foofie!

534
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:51,554
Foofie, foofie, foofie. My foofie!

535
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:57,131
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.

536
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:59,459
I think we're lost.

537
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:02,331
Nana, do you even know where you're going?

538
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:07,071
No, but I'm going with a skip
in my step and a smile on my face.

539
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:09,477
Sure, right, OK. Yeah, all right.

540
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:14,683
- It's people. Where did you come from?
- How did you get out here?

541
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:17,414
- Can you help us? We're lost.
- We're lost too.

542
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:22,152
It was awful. A flash of black and white
and they were gone. They took the jeep! Everything!

543
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,990
- That happened to our jeep too!
- What are we gonna do?

544
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,428
How are we going to survive out here?

545
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:30,490
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?!

546
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:35,438
You can let nature
get the best of you,

547
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,940
or you can get the best of nature.

548
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:44,245
Gather 'round, children.
We're New Yorkers, right?

549
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:45,577
Yeah.

550
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:49,108
We survive the concrete jungle!

551
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:52,623
When we need food, we hunt
for a decent hot dog stand.

552
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,351
- Am I right?
- She's right.

553
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:57,861
When we need shelter,
we build skyscrapers.

554
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:02,422
- Exactly!
- When we need water, we build a dam.

555
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,662
We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!

556
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:07,135
If we can make it there,

557
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,730
we can make it anywhere!

558
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:28,084
I'm coming, King Julien!

559
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,931
Bad fishy! Bad fishy!

560
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:40,935
No, shark, no! Sit!

561
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:45,105
Why am I laughing?

562
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:53,048
Skipper, we have all the parts we need,
but we're slightly behind schedule.

563
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:55,483
- How slightly?
- Six to nine years.

564
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:58,784
- Sixty-nine years?
- No, six to nine years.

565
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:01,589
Private! What happened to our thumbs?

566
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,718
Haven't seen them since yesterday, sir.

567
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:05,625
Darn you, Darwin!

568
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:10,633
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private! You're coming with me.

569
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,634
Rico! You're coming with me!

570
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:18,298
- We'll track them down and bring them in for court martial.
- That won't be necessary!

571
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:21,971
We've recruited
a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.

572
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,317
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

573
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,486
Oh, I doubt that.

574
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:41,157
Enough lollygagging. Now let's get to work.

575
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:45,267
We'll divide into three groups. Group Alpha..
you're incharge of sheet metal fabrication.

576
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:49,567
Group Bronson, you'll handle assembly.
Group George Peppard, you'll handle craft services.

577
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,005
Any questions?

578
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,833
Good! Now let's get to work.

579
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:04,018
I'd like to kiss you, monkey man.

580
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,847
All right, but you're so darn ugly.

581
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:18,434
Alright, so little cub scouts, just remember a great
dance performance comes from the heart.

582
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,861
Straight from the heart,
you'll never go wrong.

583
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:24,800
Sure, mister.

584
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:28,902
Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by,
I thought I'd wish you luck.

585
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,472
- You're not nervous, are you?
- Nah, it's my thing. You know, it's kinda what I do.

586
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:36,316
In my opinion, the key to this whole thing
is choosing the right competitor.

587
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:39,652
Oh, you mean, this is like
a dance battle sort of thing?

588
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:41,783
- Like a dance-off?
- Aa... Sure.

589
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:44,220
Great. I love that. Freestyle.

590
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:48,396
Who'd be a good match for me?
Just to keep things interesting.

591
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:51,394
Well, I wish I could help,

592
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:55,230
but that's strictly against our ancient
tradition and all we hold sacred.

593
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:59,000
But if it was me out there...
I'd choose Teetsi.

594
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:03,180
Teetsi. OK. Sounds interesting.

595
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:04,737
Makunga, right? Thank you.

596
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,484
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go get 'em, tiger.

597
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,083
Shake it out.

598
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,585
A five, six, seven, eight.

599
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,254
Let's go, let's do this.

600
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:35,101
Let us begin
the rite of passage ceremony.

601
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:38,512
- Come on, baby! Make Mama proud!
- Woman, I'm trying to take...

602
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:39,776
On it, Mom!

603
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,613
Who will be the first participant?

604
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:44,280
Me! Oh! Me, me, me!
Me! Me! Me! Me, me! Please, me?

605
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:46,954
How about you? The tall, handsome one.

606
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:48,954
Yeah. Choose your opponent.

607
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,288
Let me see.

608
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:54,954
I guess I'll pick...

609
00:38:58,069 --> 00:38:59,058
...Teetsi?

610
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:03,540
Teetsi? Why did he pick Teetsi?

611
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:07,141
That's my boy!
He's got some gumption there!

612
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:09,809
Somebody, wake him up!

613
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:26,260
All right, so, Teetsi, come on.
Let's do this, huh?

614
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:30,824
Come on, little tsetse fly.
Let's see your stuff. Bring it.

615
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:33,070
- Let's dance!
- OK.

616
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:35,901
But it's only fair to warn you
that I am a protégé of...

617
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:38,835
...Fosse and Robbins!

618
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:41,667
Not "dance" dance! Fight!

619
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:44,845
Dance fight! You got it.

620
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:53,454
- Is he dancing?
- What's he doing?

621
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:55,856
I know that boy is not dancing.

622
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,688
This is even better than I thought.

623
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,022
Alakay, turn around!

624
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:07,465
No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle,
ball change, hip swish, turn around.

625
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:18,875
Oh, no.

626
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,211
Alakay! Are you hurt?

627
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:24,214
Yeah, I am.

628
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:26,285
Did I... did I win?

629
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:27,688
No, son.

630
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,817
How could this happen?

631
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:33,955
You told us you were a king.
A king does not get beat.

632
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:38,058
I am a king. I'm the King of New York.

633
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:42,528
It's my stage name.
Like for when I perform.

634
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,766
Perform?

635
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:48,175
Oh, no, this is horrible!
Alakay has failed the test!

636
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:53,410
Who would have ever imagined
that today Zuba would have to banish...

637
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:55,676
...his own son?

638
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:57,812
Zuba, no.

639
00:40:57,922 --> 00:40:59,787
Zuba, yes.

640
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:03,924
Sadly, the alpha lion
must cast out all failures.

641
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:19,007
Then I'm no longer the alpha lion.

642
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,771
Dad, what are you doing?

643
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:24,945
Dad, no! You can't do this.

644
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:29,686
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?

645
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:31,948
Anyone?

646
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:34,120
Someone? No one?

647
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:36,549
You, sir!

648
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:38,219
I guess not.

649
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:41,287
Well, I... this is all very awkward,

650
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:45,124
but I suppose I could carry
this tremendous burden.

651
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:49,136
Teetsi! Get the hat.

652
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:54,642
As your new leader,
I hereby banish Alakay!

653
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:56,970
He shall wear this Hat of Shame...

654
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,978
...and leave the watering hole

655
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:02,808
for a thousand years, or life!

656
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:05,815
Whichever comes last.

657
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:11,661
Come on, shoo, shoo! Get out of here!

658
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:13,875
You should have told us, son!

659
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:16,160
You should have told us
that you weren't a real king!

660
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,800
You never told me
I'd have to fight anybody!

661
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,166
What did you expect, son?!

662
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:24,799
I don't know! Maybe a little fatherly
advice like, "Hey, son, it's a fight!"

663
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,673
- You're a lion, aren't you?
- But I never fought another lion in my life!

664
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:29,645
No, I guess not. You dance!

665
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:33,774
And other stuff! The point is,
your pal, Makunga, set me up back there!

666
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:36,615
-  I mean none of this would have happened...
- If you were a real lion.

667
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:38,416
- Zuba!
- Yeah, I said it!

668
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,851
A real lion.

669
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,191
Thanks.

670
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:49,021
Thanks a lot.

671
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:00,204
Saw.

672
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:02,876
Suture.

673
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:06,046
Swab.

674
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:07,648
You're in my light, Stephen.

675
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:10,547
Ooh, say, you've got a brown spot
on your shoulder.

676
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:15,316
That's very observant of you, Stephen.
As you can see, I'm covered in brown spots.

677
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:19,051
OK! That bone will be good
as new in a few weeks.

678
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,457
So I don't have
to pick out a dying hole?

679
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:23,997
No, you got
your whole life ahead of you.

680
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:26,502
- Really?
- Go out and grab it by the horns.

681
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:30,233
- Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz!
- Break a leg! Sweet kid.

682
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:33,341
This spot looks
like Witch Doctor's Disease.

683
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:38,746
Witch Doctor's Disease? That's the most
ridiculous disease I've ever heard of, Stephen.

684
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:41,915
- Don't ask.
- Someone's been knotty.

685
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:44,676
OKay, this won't hurt a bit.

686
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:49,188
Joe, our last witch doctor,
he had a spot just like that.

687
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:53,423
- And?
- Monday, Joe. Wednesday, no Joe.

688
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:55,495
Wednesday, no Joe?

689
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:58,031
I can breathe! Thanks, doc!

690
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:02,170
So this Witch Doctor's Disease
is a real thing?

691
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:06,033
You'll find a cure.
Hey, you've got at least 48 hours!

692
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,203
But I've never heard of it.

693
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:11,543
I mean... I don't have any penicillin.

694
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:14,049
I'm gonna need a CAT scan
just to get started!

695
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:17,451
Have a lion look you over.
They'd be happy to.

696
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,154
Ta-da!!

697
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:32,060
- That guy's got talent.
- Stupendous and tremendous.

698
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:33,660
Hollah!

699
00:44:33,737 --> 00:44:37,901
Bet you've never seen that one before!
Knocked 'em dead in New York!

700
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:39,966
-Hey, let's all give it a try!
- Yeah, let's do it!

701
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:42,710
Well, you can try all you want to,

702
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,805
but it's gonna take years of practice.

703
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:46,907
And you'll never quite
get a tight stream

704
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:51,444
until you build up your lip muscles
to the point where you can

705
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,683
purse your lips like this.
You got it?

706
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:08,664
Ta-da!

707
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:15,740
How did you? You guys got it
right out of the box!

708
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:17,610
- If you can do it...
...we can do it.

709
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:18,909
It's in our blood!

710
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:21,913
I always thought I was a little bit unique.

711
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:23,179
We are unique!

712
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,251
Hey, we are like a force of nature!

713
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:28,184
- A million points of light!
- And dark stripes!

714
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:30,453
Exactly the same!

715
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:33,852
Exactly the same.

716
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:38,860
Looks impressive,
Kowalski, but will it fly?

717
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:42,695
Yes. If we fold it here, here and here.

718
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:45,864
Nice.

719
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:02,381
Oh, man. My dad thinks
I'm a total loser.

720
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:04,389
I've ruined my parents' lives.

721
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:06,562
That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'.

722
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:11,294
It is lackin' in the crackin',
my friend. I've gotta fix this.

723
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:12,728
So...

724
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:17,229
...there's...
There's something I gotta tell you.

725
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:18,396
Hey, guys.

726
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:21,309
Is this place great or what?!

727
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:23,340
I'd go with "or what."

728
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:27,076
Well, I'll tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it, but...

729
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:30,075
...I got a date with Moto Moto.

730
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:32,411
Who's Moto Moto?

731
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:36,084
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big!

732
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:38,758
- Know what "Moto Moto" means?
- Twins?

733
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:40,759
It means, "Hot Hot."

734
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,056
"Hot Hot"?

735
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:44,928
OKay, when did you start parlez-ing African?

736
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:46,191
It's in my blood.

737
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:50,065
Don't worry, you can flirt around
with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.

738
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,007
What's the deal Melman?
Why am I the parade and you're the rain?

739
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:55,237
Why do you have to drive
your parade under my rain?

740
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:58,008
Maybe I'll just parade myself
in another part of town!

741
00:46:58,115 --> 00:46:59,480
Whoa, guys.

742
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:01,173
Fine by me. Main Street's mine!

743
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:03,412
Well, you can have it your
old stinking Main Street!

744
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:07,617
And you can take your hotee-tot float
and Mr. Hotee Moto Moto...

745
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:09,882
- What are you talking about?
- What are we talking about?

746
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:11,458
Melman, why don't you just tell her.

747
00:47:11,791 --> 00:47:14,690
You tell.. What? Tell her..
What are you talking about...

748
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:15,688
I don't know what you're talking about.

749
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:17,098
So I guess I'll go, then.

750
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,566
You know what? Don't bother.

751
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:22,230
- Don't get up on my account.
- Melman! Gloria!

752
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:26,640
- I thought you guys were friends!
- Come on guys, Marty's absolutely right.

753
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:28,473
- Marty?
- Marty?

754
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:29,703
Marty?

755
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:32,308
What the heck is going on?

756
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:37,577
You're not? Oh! He was... I thought
he... You're not him. He's... Oh.

757
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:40,418
You thought that guy...

758
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:41,752
...was me?

759
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:44,589
No. I mean, yes, you... Guys, come on.

760
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:46,822
You thought I was him?

761
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:49,155
You guys kind of do look a little...

762
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:51,895
You look a lot alike.
Marty, you look a lot alike.

763
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:55,837
You laugh alike. Talk alike.
He has the same speech pattern.

764
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:58,966
It's a little weird, really.
I mean, come on. Marty.

765
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:02,204
So you're saying there's
nothing unique about me.

766
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:04,505
I'm just like any other zebra.

767
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:06,173
No. Of course you're different!

768
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:07,847
How?

769
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,680
OK, I can't tell you apart.

770
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:14,820
Maybe you could wear
a bell or something.

771
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,520
- A bell?!
- OK, not a bell. Bell's a bad idea.

772
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:20,523
How about a T-shirt that says,
"I'm with stupid"?

773
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:23,289
- I'm not stupid!
- Not you, stupid! Him, stupid!

774
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:26,866
You know what? While you've been off doing
the prancing pony with your new posse,

775
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:30,369
I've been having pretty much
the worst day of my life, okay.

776
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:34,040
It's always about you, isn't it?

777
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:37,643
My problems are just
a little bit bigger than yours.

778
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:40,547
I couldn't tell you apart. So what?!

779
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:43,880
Yeah, fine. Run away, Marty! Run away!

780
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:47,215
That's what you do best!
Just like back in New York!

781
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:50,722
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that, right?

782
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:56,261
Your one-of-a-million friend
hopes you enjoy

783
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:59,166
your bigger-than-anyone-else's
problems alone!

784
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:02,864
Good, leave! I don't need you
to help me solve my problems!

785
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:06,069
You know what? You're a dime a dozen!
I can't tell which one's Marty!

786
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:09,169
Which one's Marty? Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, I don't care!

787
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:11,908
Nice hat, you showoff!

788
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:18,752
Marty...

789
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:21,246
...don't go.

790
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:21,959
Giddy-up, giddy-up!

791
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,256
Giddy-up, giddy-up!

792
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:27,594
Look, Maurice!

793
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:30,163
The perfect spot for my summer palace!

794
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:34,268
Please fill in all these holes
and relocate the riff-raff.

795
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:38,603
- Who'd leave a perfectly good head lying around?
- What a waste.

796
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:41,934
Tell me about it. I'm in my prime here.

797
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:44,509
I'm terminal, you know?

798
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:49,042
I probably only have
another two days left to live.

799
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:51,447
That's a bummer, man.

800
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:54,450
If I, King Julien... that's my name...

801
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,952
...only had two days left to live,

802
00:49:57,294 --> 00:49:58,727
I would do all the things

803
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:01,286
- I've ever dreamed of doing.
- Like what?

804
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:04,391
I would love to become
a professional whistler.

805
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:08,734
I'm pretty amazing at it now,
but I want to get like even better,

806
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:10,796
make my living out of it.

807
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:24,416
You know what else I would do?
I would invade a neighboring country

808
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:28,424
and impose my own ideology,
even if they didn't want it!

809
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:30,426
Easy for you to say. You're a king.

810
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:34,653
Yes. And you are
only just a sad little head.

811
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:38,766
There must be something
you want to do before you die!

812
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:42,771
- There is this one thing.
- What is it? Tell me.

813
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:45,831
- No, I couldn't.
- What is it?

814
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:48,503
I just never really have the guts
 to tell Gloria how I feel about her.

815
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:50,443
What is it? Please tell me!

816
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:54,280
I never had the guts
to tell Gloria how I feel about her.

817
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:55,943
How I've always felt about her.

818
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:57,850
Fine. Don't tell me!

819
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:03,118
Oh, is it a woman?
You didn't tell me you're talking about a woman.

820
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:07,527
What are you afraid of?
You're a dead man anyway.

821
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:09,798
Yeah. Yeah.

822
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:11,800
You're right.

823
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:15,133
You've got to march
right up to this woman.

824
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:18,538
Look her right in the eye. Lean forward.

825
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:21,366
Just a little, or almost all the way.

826
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:25,647
Then you let her lean forward
a little until you're...

827
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:29,151
...just lips' distance
away from each other.

828
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:32,882
Then you just tell her 
how much you hate her.

829
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:37,455
Actually, it's more like love her.

830
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:40,394
Oh, you sly dog! Woof, woof!

831
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:44,063
You're a real player, you know that. 
Now listen to me.

832
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:46,963
You got to rise up. You hearing me?

833
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:48,636
- He didn't hear you.
- I can't hear you!

834
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:51,740
- You got to rise up!
- Rising up!

835
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:55,301
- Get out of the hole!
- I'm rising out of the ground!

836
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:57,410
- He's rising, Maurice.
- I'm rising, Maurice!

837
00:51:57,647 --> 00:52:00,411
- Rising!
- You gonna go right up to this woman!

838
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:02,307
Do you feel it?

839
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:05,084
- You gonna go up to her face!
- Tell the truth!

840
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:10,325
- I'm going to tell her!
- Then you say, "Baby, I dig you!"

841
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:13,586
Yeah! I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!

842
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:16,194
I love that happy little head.

843
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:18,425
<i> # She love # </i>

844
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:20,329
<i> # Moto Moto # </i>

845
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:22,528
<i> # She love # </i>

846
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:24,103
<i> # Moto Moto # </i>

847
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:27,777
She loves me
She loves my eyes

848
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:31,778
She loves me
She loves my thighs

849
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:33,946
She loves my roundness

850
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:38,118
She love that I'm chunky
She love that I'm plumpy

851
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:42,289
She love my heftiness
She love my zestiness

852
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:46,460
She love me restlessly
She love me forever

853
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:48,491
She love me...

854
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:50,224
...'cause she love me

855
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:51,798
Moto Moto...

856
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:55,465
...before things get too serious, well,

857
00:52:55,805 --> 00:52:59,798
I was wondering,
if I were to, for example, stay here...

858
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:01,474
...I'd like to ask you...

859
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:06,145
Let your candied lips be
the messengers to my... ear canal.

860
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:08,581
I have so many questions.

861
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:12,254
I promise the answer will always be yes.

862
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:14,984
Unless no is required.

863
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:19,324
So what is it about me
that you find so interesting?

864
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:22,930
You're the most plumpenest girl
I've ever met.

865
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:24,933
OK. Other than that.

866
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:26,662
Let's see.

867
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:29,728
Yeah, well, you know... you chunky.

868
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:32,005
Right.

869
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:36,342
My gosh, girl, you huge.

870
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:37,602
You said that.

871
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:39,838
Yeah, that's right.

872
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:42,515
We don't have to talk no more.

873
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:43,946
Gloria!

874
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:46,280
Gloria.

875
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:47,683
Melman.

876
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:53,526
Melman, I want you to meet Moto Moto.

877
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:58,695
Moto Moto. Yeah, nice to meet you.

878
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:02,664
- I guess I...
- It's OK, Melman.

879
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,263
Apology accepted.

880
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:09,040
Oh. Yeah, right, that.
That's why I... Good.

881
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:12,514
OK. Well, that's it, then.

882
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:15,710
Good. We're kind of busy here, man.

883
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:18,543
No. No, that's not it.

884
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:23,048
Listen, Mototo, you better treat
this lady like a queen.

885
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,893
Because you, my friend,
you found yourself the perfect woman.

886
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:29,655
If I was ever so lucky
to find the perfect woman,

887
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:33,499
I'd give her flowers every day.
And not just any flowers. OK?

888
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:37,506
Her favorites are orchids.
White. And breakfast in bed.

889
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:39,940
Six loaves of wheat toast,
with butter on both sides.

890
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:41,671
No crust, the way she likes it.

891
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:45,244
I'd be her shoulder to cry on
and her best friend.

892
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:49,009
I'd spend every day thinking
of how to make her laugh.

893
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:52,748
She has the most amazing laugh.

894
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:59,084
I mean that's what I would do
 if I were you.

895
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:01,761
But I'm not, so you do it.

896
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:04,760
OK.

897
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:07,100
What?

898
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:10,604
That was beautiful.

899
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:14,107
Anyways, where were we?

900
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:15,942
I'm "huge"?

901
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:19,408
Surprised to see me, Makunga?

902
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:22,713
Well, I'm here to set things straight,
like a real lion!

903
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:27,120
Is this real enough for you? How
about this? This is for setting me up!

904
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:31,183
This is for stealing my dad's job!
This is for humiliating my family!

905
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:33,729
And making me look like a fool!

906
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:53,476
Had enough? Sure, fly away!

907
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:55,148
Coward.

908
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:08,661
The water. It's gone.

909
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:10,829
The watering hole has 
never gone dry before.

910
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,767
- We'll need a lot more dying holes.
- How could this happen?

911
00:56:13,837 --> 00:56:17,102
Out of my way! What is going on here?!

912
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:20,040
The watering hole is dried up!
There's barely enough water for one of us!

913
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:22,442
- Yes, good observation, Shirley.
- I'm Bobby.

914
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:24,002
Makunga, what do we do?

915
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,570
Quiet!

916
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:31,009
Listen up! I'm afraid there is only
one solution to this horrible crisis:

917
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:33,750
We'll all have to fight for it.

918
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:36,348
- Fight for it? We can't fight for it.
- That's crazy.

919
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:39,351
That's not fair. You'd win!

920
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:40,860
Exactly, Shirley.

921
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:42,019
I'm Bob...

922
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:45,932
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now,

923
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:49,194
thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.

924
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:52,999
Please, Makunga, this is
the only water on the reserve.

925
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:57,035
If you're thirsty, you'll have to look
for water off the reserve.

926
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:59,644
- Off the reserve?
- It's too dangerous!

927
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:01,182
<i>Hunters would shoot us!</i>

928
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:03,151
<i>No one leaves the reserve and survives!</i>

929
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:05,050
I left the reserve!

930
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:07,216
And survived.

931
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:10,492
I could do something about this.

932
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:13,830
Looks like a clogged pipe, 
like we get in New York all the time. 

933
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:14,894
I'll just travel upriver...

934
00:57:14,964 --> 00:57:17,091
- Upriver?
- Off the reserve?

935
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:18,293
You?

936
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:22,363
Yeah, me. I'll unclog the pipe
and bring back your water.

937
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:27,570
Great! I'd help you pack, but by the
looks of that hat, I see you're all set!

938
00:57:28,578 --> 00:57:33,242
Fine. Go ahead, laugh. Laugh
your mane off. I'm gonna prove you wrong.

939
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:36,410
Maybe you should try
a little rain dance.

940
00:57:42,325 --> 00:57:43,656
Zuba would know what to do.

941
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:45,758
- Where's Zuba?
- You don't care about us.

942
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:48,088
Zuba should be in charge, not you.

943
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:54,327
All right, fine!

944
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:58,096
As an added measure,
I will consult with Zuba!

945
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:05,945
Marty?

946
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:16,789
Hey! Marty!

947
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:23,121
Marty?

948
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:27,561
Marty.

949
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:29,296
Where'd you get the fruity hat?

950
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:31,800
Excuse me! Excuse me!

951
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:35,133
Hi. Is Marty in there?

952
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:37,973
Anyone seen Marty?

953
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,150
Which one of us is Marty?

954
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:45,314
All right. Well, if you see him,

955
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:47,822
tell him his friend Alex
came to say goodbye.

956
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:50,655
Goodbye? Don't go. Where are you going?

957
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:54,094
- Can we come?
- No. This is something I have to do alone.

958
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:56,324
You can't leave the reserve!

959
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:09,075
What are you doing?

960
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:11,506
- They're gonna get your hat.
- Hunters are everywhere!

961
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:14,005
Could you leave the hat?

962
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:15,744
Marty! Look, I know you're in there.

963
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:19,845
Before I go, I got something
I want to say.

964
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:23,121
You've been a great friend.

965
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:26,684
You've helped me so often
to see the bright side of my problems

966
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:28,628
that I never think of you having any.

967
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:32,524
I wasn't there for you
when you needed me.

968
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:34,867
Just like back at the zoo.

969
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:40,038
What kind of friend does that make me?
A pretty lousy friend, I guess.

970
00:59:40,877 --> 00:59:42,538
I just want you to know that I...

971
00:59:43,546 --> 00:59:45,377
You're one in a million.

972
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:47,713
This is touching.

973
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:49,217
It is touching.

974
00:59:49,552 --> 00:59:53,044
So could you turn around
so I can tell you to your face?

975
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:55,714
That's right. Gotcha!

976
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:58,653
I see you in there! Yeah, you.

977
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:00,662
You, right there.

978
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:04,996
Twelfth row, two hundred
and third from the left.

979
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:06,467
That's you, Marty.

980
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:08,564
I know it's you.

981
01:00:10,406 --> 01:00:12,465
Know what makes you special?

982
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:17,246
These guys are white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.

983
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,141
You're a dreamer, Marty.

984
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:23,078
Always have been.
You have great taste in music

985
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:25,751
and horrible taste in friends.

986
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:29,252
Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me.

987
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:33,027
OK, I'm in.

988
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:35,428
No Marty, you can't come with me.

989
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:37,261
I don't believe you have a choice.

990
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:44,767
- People are out there!
- You're crazy! Come back!

991
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:46,769
The people will get you!

992
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:49,169
Don't lose the hat!

993
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:51,377
Bye, hat!

994
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:56,043
Any water?

995
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:59,786
No, just more diamonds and gold.

996
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:06,460
OK, don't give up hope.

997
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:09,430
Listen up! I will help you!

998
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:12,627
There's only one way
to get your precious water.

999
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:15,966
I, your beloved King Julien

1000
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:21,136
must simply make a small sacrifice
to my good friends, the water gods,

1001
01:01:21,477 --> 01:01:24,310
in the volcano!

1002
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:28,977
What does that do?

1003
01:01:29,218 --> 01:01:31,880
What does that do? Excellent question.

1004
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:35,249
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.

1005
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:39,317
The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.

1006
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:41,823
"Thank you for the sacrifice."

1007
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:44,765
"Here, have another sacrifice"
"No, I've had enough for the day."

1008
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:47,200
"I'm gonna be very insulted
unless you have another."

1009
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:49,704
"I don't want another sacrifice, OK!"

1010
01:01:49,772 --> 01:01:52,832
"Look at you! You look skinny!"
"No! I think I had enough! Is that clear?"

1011
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:58,438
The gods eat the sacrifice.
They are grateful.

1012
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:02,382
They give me some of their water,
and then I give it to you.

1013
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:03,680
What?

1014
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,246
Does it work?

1015
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:08,020
No! I mean, yes.

1016
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:10,014
Well, Maurice?

1017
01:02:10,359 --> 01:02:12,691
Ah, it's fifty-fifty.

1018
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:15,527
We'll do it!

1019
01:02:16,532 --> 01:02:17,863
Excellent!

1020
01:02:18,534 --> 01:02:22,402
Now all I need is someone
who would like to go into the volcano

1021
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:24,463
and get eaten by gods.

1022
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:27,768
Any hands! Hands, anybody!

1023
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:31,371
I need someone, perhaps
who has never found love,

1024
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:36,617
who could look death straight
in the eyeball. A real, genuine hero.

1025
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:38,711
- I'll do it.
- Melman?

1026
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:51,894
Hurry up! Before we all
come to our senses!

1027
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:54,960
Melman, what is wrong with you?

1028
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:59,902
I'm dying anyway. If there's a chance
it'll get you water, it'll be worth it.

1029
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:02,006
Are you nuts?

1030
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:04,774
Gloria, I just want you to know, 
back at the zoo,

1031
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:08,180
it was never the doctors
or prescriptions that kept me going.

1032
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:10,510
It was always you.

1033
01:03:10,586 --> 01:03:13,020
Seeing you every day.

1034
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:15,250
That's what kept me going.

1035
01:03:18,928 --> 01:03:20,919
Melman! Wait!

1036
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:26,662
Melman! Melman! Melman!

1037
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:31,929
You going to mope around like this all day?

1038
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:34,265
Don't "hmph" me.

1039
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:38,207
Listen, Zuba. A miracle happened.

1040
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:40,744
Our son has came back to us.

1041
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,150
How come that is not good enough for you?

1042
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:45,346
What are you saying, woman?

1043
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:50,453
We lost him once, Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.

1044
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:01,133
Zuba!

1045
01:04:02,138 --> 01:04:03,799
- Zuba!
- Get out of here!

1046
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,701
What do you want, Makunga?

1047
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:06,969
It's awful.

1048
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:09,372
The watering hole is dried up.

1049
01:04:09,445 --> 01:04:12,380
Dried up? That's impossible!

1050
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:14,313
There's nothing left!

1051
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:18,149
Well, you're the alpha lion, Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?

1052
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:22,453
Your son, Alakay, he said he
could fix it. He's gone upriver.

1053
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,117
- Off the reserve?!
- No!

1054
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:26,923
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide.

1055
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:29,260
But he was determined
to prove himself to you.

1056
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:33,400
You stay here, in case he comes back!

1057
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:37,666
Hurry, Zuba!

1058
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:42,604
I'm so parched.

1059
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:51,347
Is this place starting to freak you out?

1060
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:55,948
We'll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters will never know we were here.

1061
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:57,754
Why are we doing this?

1062
01:04:58,100 --> 01:04:59,813
Look, Marty...

1063
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,360
Maybe my dad will think I'm...

1064
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:04,230
I just want to show him 
I'm a real lion.

1065
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:07,463
As opposed to a chocolate lion.

1066
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:12,974
I know this may sound hard to believe,
but apparently, lions don't dance.

1067
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:14,100
What?!

1068
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:15,093
Shh..

1069
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:16,976
At least as far as my dad is concerned.

1070
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:19,640
As far as people are concerned,
you're a huge hit.

1071
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:23,045
That was New York. This is Africa...
it's a much tougher crowd.

1072
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:24,800
Marty, Marty, this is it!

1073
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,200
Shh...

1074
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:28,713
- This is the clog! Come on.
- Hush.

1075
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:37,892
Well, there's the water.

1076
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:42,560
Marty, Stay down. Look at that.

1077
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:45,237
Knit one, purl two.

1078
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:46,400
It's her.

1079
01:05:46,475 --> 01:05:48,170
- Is this right?
- Very good.

1080
01:05:48,244 --> 01:05:50,178
Nana, slow down.

1081
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:53,010
You're a little tangled, aren't you?

1082
01:05:53,082 --> 01:05:55,414
No, don't pull. I'll do it.

1083
01:05:56,352 --> 01:05:57,819
We need dynamite. You got any dynamite?

1084
01:05:58,087 --> 01:06:01,500
Oh, snap! I just used
my last stick this morning!

1085
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,452
Shh.

1086
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,089
- Savages!
- Evasive maneuvers!

1087
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:08,728
- Serpentine, serpentine!
- Squiggly squid maneuver!

1088
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:11,596
Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!

1089
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:14,266
No, no! Squiggly squid!

1090
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:15,695
Etch A Sketch!

1091
01:06:15,938 --> 01:06:18,930
That's too complex! Octopus, octopus!

1092
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:24,443
- Run, Marty!
- Come on, I can't leave you here!

1093
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:28,514
Go get help! Squiggly squid maneuver!
Go! Go! Squiggly squid!

1094
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:31,719
Etch A Sketch! Etch A Sketch!

1095
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:36,049
 # Save us. 
We love you. # 

1096
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:37,456
OK.

1097
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:40,455
OK, OK, OK.

1098
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:49,166
<i>-  #  Save us
- Melman  # </i>

1099
01:06:49,238 --> 01:06:50,967
<i>-  # We love you
- Melman # </i>

1100
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,029
<i> # Save us # </i>

1101
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:54,542
OK, here we go. OK, OK.

1102
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:56,601
<i>-  # Melman
- We love you # </i>

1103
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:58,237
<i>-  # Melman
- Save us # </i>

1104
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:01,009
Here we go! Here we go!

1105
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:04,083
- What's all the hoopla about?
- Joe?

1106
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,811
Joe the Witch Doctor?
We thought you were dead!

1107
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:10,547
So did I. Then I realized
I'm covered in brown spots.

1108
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:13,659
So Melman's not dying!

1109
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:16,825
- Melman's not dying!
- Oh, no!

1110
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:18,155
Melman!

1111
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:19,765
Move!

1112
01:07:20,002 --> 01:07:23,768
Don't do this! 
Julien, stop this! This is crazy!

1113
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:28,708
Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe
into a volcano to make water is crazy!

1114
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:29,767
Yes!

1115
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:36,307
- Please, Melman! Stop!
- Gloria?

1116
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:38,444
- You can't do this!
- Why not?

1117
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:40,018
Because...

1118
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:00,936
You can't do this, Melman.

1119
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:02,871
First of all, that hurts.

1120
01:08:03,145 --> 01:08:06,273
Second of all, I've only got
18 hours to live, anyway.

1121
01:08:06,348 --> 01:08:08,873
Melman, I gotta know...

1122
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:12,543
...did you really mean all 
those things you said about me?

1123
01:08:13,556 --> 01:08:14,955
Of course I did.

1124
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:17,384
- It's crazy.
- It is?

1125
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:24,055
It's crazy to think I had to go
halfway around the world...

1126
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:27,397
...to find out that 
the perfect guy for me

1127
01:08:27,736 --> 01:08:29,397
lived right next door.

1128
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:32,738
Then I guess it's you and me, neighbor.

1129
01:08:32,975 --> 01:08:35,637
You and me for the next 18 hours.

1130
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:38,072
I'll take whatever you got.

1131
01:08:42,418 --> 01:08:45,683
- Maurice, what just happened?
- I believe the fat lady has sung.

1132
01:08:45,754 --> 01:08:48,587
- Hey, what's going on here?
- Marty!

1133
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:52,589
Hey, listen up. Alex is in big trouble!
We got to get upriver fast!

1134
01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:55,092
- What about the plane?
- Perfect! Come on!

1135
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:01,667
The plane won't be fixed
until the suits meet our demands.

1136
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:03,432
Now, about maternity leave.

1137
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:06,998
Maternity leave? You're all males.

1138
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:09,567
Look. 
We need that plane for a rescue mission.

1139
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:12,580
Well, there's nothing I can do
until we bust up this union.

1140
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:16,015
I'll going to get to busting up all of you
if you don't get this plane going.

1141
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:20,419
Can't you see these commies have
my hands tied here? No maternity leave.

1142
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:27,986
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want
these blowing around on the savanna.

1143
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:39,768
All right. You get your maternity leave.

1144
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:42,508
Finally.

1145
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:50,448
Where we headed?
What's going on? Where are we going?

1146
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:54,182
Oh, no! Please! 
You're not going to put me there! No!

1147
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:56,184
This is wrong.

1148
01:09:56,258 --> 01:09:59,819
You see? You are survivors.

1149
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:03,695
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?

1150
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:05,657
You can't eat a lion.

1151
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:07,668
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken.

1152
01:10:07,736 --> 01:10:10,034
No, no, no. Don't listen to her.

1153
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:13,034
She's out of her mind, people!

1154
01:10:15,177 --> 01:10:16,872
I'm from New York City too!

1155
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:19,614
It's me, Alex the lion!
From Central Park!

1156
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:28,212
Dad!

1157
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:33,390
What were you thinking, son?
You got no business being out here!

1158
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:37,228
I want you to stay behind me.

1159
01:10:37,299 --> 01:10:40,496
They're New Yorkers.
They're just rude and frightened people.

1160
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:42,067
Stay back!

1161
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:44,395
You're gonna let your dinner get away?

1162
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:54,079
- What are you doing, son?
- The only thing I know how to do.

1163
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,309
What the heck?

1164
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:06,758
Hey, I know those moves.

1165
01:11:07,196 --> 01:11:08,254
Alex?

1166
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:13,997
- It's Alex the lion!
- From Central Park!

1167
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:15,701
It is Alex!

1168
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:18,433
Only one lion can move like that!

1169
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:25,110
He's beautiful.

1170
01:11:25,347 --> 01:11:26,336
I can't believe it.

1171
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,283
How does he do that?

1172
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:49,362
Dad, what are you doing?

1173
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:52,300
I'm dancing with my son! I think.

1174
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:54,131
Don't think, Dad. Feel!

1175
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,805
Butterfly!

1176
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:01,312
I'm feeling it! I'm feeling it!

1177
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,153
Roar!

1178
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:28,166
That was beautiful. Now let's eat!

1179
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:29,738
Dad, look out!

1180
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,007
What the...

1181
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:34,840
Alex! Get in!

1182
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:38,679
She's got a gun! 
Let's get out while we can!

1183
01:12:38,954 --> 01:12:40,546
- What?
- She's got a gun!

1184
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:43,021
Let's get out while we can! Pass it on!

1185
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:51,189
He said let's have some fun
and take out the dam. Basset hound.

1186
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:54,527
Skipper! Alex wants to take out the dam.

1187
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:57,102
All right! But it's his funeral.

1188
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:01,040
- Hard to port!
- Aye-aye, Skippy!

1189
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:03,868
Bring it on! Bring it on!

1190
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,551
Come back! That's my dinner!

1191
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:14,449
Kowalski, full throttle.

1192
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:18,048
Music!

1193
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:21,653
- I like this song.
- It never gets old.

1194
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:25,799
It does have a catchy hook.
Come about! Bring her in low!

1195
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:30,060
Hold onto your skirts!
It's dam-busting time!

1196
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,403
Hold on tight, baby! Here we go!

1197
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:38,239
Tell them no! Pull up! They'll kill us!

1198
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,472
There's got to be another way!
Pass it on!

1199
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:48,918
They say no pull up. Kill us.
There's no other way. Basset hound.

1200
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:50,489
Are you sure?

1201
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:55,253
Men, there is no sacrifice greater
than someone else's.

1202
01:13:55,597 --> 01:13:56,928
No! Medic!

1203
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:02,763
Ramming speed!

1204
01:14:07,509 --> 01:14:08,601
Bring it on!

1205
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:12,777
Bad kitties.

1206
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:23,448
I don't know
why the sacrifice didn't work.

1207
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:26,124
The science seemed so solid.

1208
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:31,295
I'd jump right in that volcano
if I wasn't so good at whistling.

1209
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:42,967
It's you! I found you!

1210
01:14:43,212 --> 01:14:44,201
Mort?

1211
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:48,643
Bad fishy!

1212
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:00,560
I wonder if the gods like seafood.

1213
01:15:00,896 --> 01:15:02,488
Let's go find out.

1214
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:05,330
Look, Maurice.

1215
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:09,498
- That was quick.
- I did it!

1216
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:12,329
I did it! I did it!

1217
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:14,664
OK, you did it!

1218
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:16,673
Oh, yes!!

1219
01:15:42,804 --> 01:15:43,793
Look!

1220
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:46,204
- It's Alakay!
- It's Zuba!

1221
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:48,707
You did it!

1222
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:51,202
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!

1223
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,544
Zuba! Alakay!

1224
01:16:00,155 --> 01:16:01,144
You're back!

1225
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:04,949
I'm so glad you're safe!

1226
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:07,555
Out of my way.

1227
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:10,562
Well, well, well.

1228
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:16,061
You know, Zuba, if I remember correctly,
you quit the pride.

1229
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,236
And you were kicked out.

1230
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:22,238
So don't think for an instant
that this changes anything.

1231
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:27,312
You're right. In fact, we humbly present
you with this token of appreciation.

1232
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,847
It's a man bag. 
Very popular where I come from.

1233
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:32,284
- I don't know what to say.
- You can still be tough and carry your stuff.

1234
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:37,519
Does the strap adjust? This will go
very nicely for me when I go out hiking.

1235
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:39,750
But I'm afraid you're still banished.

1236
01:16:39,995 --> 01:16:41,758
We figured you'd say that.

1237
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:46,093
My handbag!

1238
01:16:46,868 --> 01:16:48,335
You bad kitty!

1239
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:53,798
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1240
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:06,344
You deserve this, son.

1241
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:09,617
Welcome to the pride.

1242
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:17,130
Thanks, Dad. But this belongs to you.

1243
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:19,957
No, son. To us!

1244
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:29,304
My son! The King of New York!

1245
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:32,970
That's my baby!

1246
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:43,314
Love transcends all differences.

1247
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:48,326
We are gathered here today
to celebrate such a love.

1248
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:52,497
Do you take each other,
for better or for worse?

1249
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:57,265
For better, please.

1250
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:01,165
What a beautiful, weird couple!

1251
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:03,341
That's not going to last.

1252
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:06,413
Can I kiss the bride, skipper?

1253
01:18:06,748 --> 01:18:08,340
No! Music!

1254
01:18:09,084 --> 01:18:10,176
- Struts.
- Check.

1255
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:11,508
- Flaps!
- Check.

1256
01:18:11,753 --> 01:18:13,516
- Diamonds and gold.
- Check.

1257
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:17,685
- Bye-bye!
- We'll miss you!

1258
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:18,953
See you later!

1259
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:21,962
We'll be back after the honeymoon
in Monte Carlo,

1260
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:23,861
or whenever the gold runs out.

1261
01:18:24,099 --> 01:18:25,293
- Take care of yourselves.
- Come back soon!

1262
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:30,462
Mom, let them take their time. New York
isn't going anywhere, right, guys?

1263
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:32,564
Yeah, you're right about that!

1264
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:34,575
As long as I'm with her...

1265
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:38,443
...and you two, I don't care
where we are.

1266
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:41,205
She has the most amazing laugh.

1267
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:46,384
Love has no boundaries!

1268
01:18:47,322 --> 01:18:49,654
Well, looks like you're stuck
with us for a while.

1269
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:55,162
Dad? What's wrong?

1270
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:57,892
I just thought we
could hang out a bit and...

1271
01:19:00,335 --> 01:19:02,462
- You got me!
- I got you, son!

1272
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:06,139
You got me with my thing.
You brought it back around on me.

1273
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:10,738
I got you, son!

1274
01:19:11,346 --> 01:19:13,678
The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty?

1275
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:16,183
- Marty? Who's Marty?
- Come on.

1276
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:19,516
- I don't know no Marty. Don't call me Marty.
- You can't fool me.

1277
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:21,783
I don't see no Marty. 
Ain't no Marty here.

1278
01:19:21,857 --> 01:19:26,294
Marty! I can look into your eyes,
and I know it's you.

1279
01:19:26,361 --> 01:19:29,626
<i># See, I've been traveling
Been traveling forever # </i>

1280
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:32,963
<i># But now that I found a home
feels like I'm in heaven# </i>

1281
01:19:33,034 --> 01:19:36,299

Been traveling forever# </i>

1282
01:19:36,371 --> 01:19:38,202
<i># But now that I'm home # </i>

1283
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:41,936
Hey! Shake the hot things!
Shake the hot things!

1284
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:45,607
Shake 'em! Shake 'em! Shake 'em!
