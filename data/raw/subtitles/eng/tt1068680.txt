Unknown caller

2
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,251
No.

3
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,282
No, means No.

4
00:00:44,413 --> 00:00:47,203
Bonjour.
- Carl, I know it's you

5
00:00:48,053 --> 00:00:50,688
Oh, hey man

6
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,846
I had your number dialed and was about to press send.

7
00:00:54,109 --> 00:00:56,001
Did you block your number?

8
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,402
Yeah, I did.
You never answer when I don't.

9
00:00:59,862 --> 00:01:01,546
So, what are you doing?

10
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:03,147
Oh, just hanging out in my apartment.

11
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,483
You did get my text right?

12
00:01:05,584 --> 00:01:06,784
What? Text, what?

13
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,016
We're all going out tonight.
- Oh, man that sounds great. I wish I could join you.

14
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,977
I'm just so jammed up.
I'm totally off the grid. Know what I mean?

15
00:01:14,073 --> 00:01:16,074
Uh, no I don't at all.

16
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,855
I have a bunch of stuff going on.
There's this thing I gotta do.

17
00:01:18,935 --> 00:01:21,311
Any other night would have been great.
Darn it to heck!

18
00:01:21,406 --> 00:01:22,206
Thing? What thing?

19
00:01:22,307 --> 00:01:24,239
- A thing. You know? Just a thing.

20
00:01:24,336 --> 00:01:28,702
If I had my thing in front of me I could
tell you what it is, but... I know there's a thing.

21
00:01:28,852 --> 00:01:31,788
A thing, huh? I don't think there's anything
written down in your fake calendar.

22
00:01:32,405 --> 00:01:34,508
No, it's a specific thing.

23
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:38,009
A specific thing,
like getting in line at the video store?

24
00:01:38,142 --> 00:01:39,352
What are you talking about?

25
00:01:39,696 --> 00:01:42,442
I'm not at the video store.
I'm in my apartment.

26
00:01:42,523 --> 00:01:45,023
I can see you Carl.
I'm outside the video store.

27
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:49,243
That's not me.
- It's not?

28
00:01:49,354 --> 00:01:50,754
Oh, I know what's happening.

29
00:01:50,855 --> 00:01:55,040
There's this guy who looks just like me,
who goes to a lot of the same video stores

30
00:01:55,104 --> 00:01:56,722
That's probably who you are seeing right now.

31
00:01:56,897 --> 00:02:00,876
Wow, that's amazing, because his mouth
is moving in exact sync with what you're saying.

32
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,304
Carl, I know you are not saying anything.

33
00:02:05,152 --> 00:02:06,575
Carl, get outside.

34
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,520
I know you are not talking.
- What?

35
00:02:08,594 --> 00:02:10,327
Carl!
- Alright.

36
00:02:13,025 --> 00:02:14,329
Look who's here.

37
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:17,523
Wow.

38
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,205
I don't believe it,
Carl Allen.

39
00:02:23,027 --> 00:02:24,990
Never thought I'd see the day, my man.

40
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:26,967
I thought you had hung up
your spurs you old cowboy.

41
00:02:27,089 --> 00:02:30,952
No, I just got a lot of stuff going on.
Some things I gotta do.

42
00:02:31,014 --> 00:02:32,809
Issues pending. They keep me pretty busy.

43
00:02:33,249 --> 00:02:34,306
Yes, I hear you buddy.

44
00:02:34,474 --> 00:02:38,979
So, we are really excited for you to be here Carl,
because we have an announcement to make.

45
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:41,101
Honey, show'em.

46
00:02:41,425 --> 00:02:43,782
Oh! There it is. Deal with it!

47
00:02:43,812 --> 00:02:45,505
We are engaged.

48
00:02:48,263 --> 00:02:51,482
That is a big step, huh?
- Yeah it's a big step.

49
00:02:51,577 --> 00:02:53,490
Moving fast. That's okay.

50
00:02:53,588 --> 00:02:55,321
What has it been? Six months?

51
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:57,041
No.
- Two years.

52
00:02:57,809 --> 00:02:59,637
Oh, yeah, that's about right then.

53
00:03:00,307 --> 00:03:04,092
So, anyway, we are going to have an
engagement party on the 21st. Open bar.

54
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,146
Oh, you bastard. Always knows how to get me.

55
00:03:06,763 --> 00:03:08,263
Carl, does that work for you?

56
00:03:08,487 --> 00:03:10,263
Yeah, we'll figure it out.

57
00:03:10,402 --> 00:03:11,931
What's there to figure out?

58
00:03:11,973 --> 00:03:15,492
Oh God, look who's here.
- I'm not falling for that Carl. what's to figure out?

59
00:03:15,587 --> 00:03:19,025
Carl it's open bar. What's the problem?
- I'm serious. Stephanie's at the bar.

60
00:03:19,175 --> 00:03:22,313
The Stephanie?
- Yes, my ex. She's at the bar.

61
00:03:23,966 --> 00:03:25,659
Oh God, that is Stephanie.

62
00:03:25,944 --> 00:03:30,061
Looks like she's with someone there too.
- Yeah, they seem to be thriving. Good for her.

63
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,796
Oh look, they're touching each other's genitals.
Isn't that amazing?

64
00:03:34,917 --> 00:03:36,198
I'm so glad I came out.

65
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,152
OK, you know what? I gotta go.
- No, Carl, you're going to stay.

66
00:03:40,281 --> 00:03:43,598
It's been three years. You can't leave every time...
- It's totally unrelated.

67
00:03:43,694 --> 00:03:46,263
It has nothing to do with Stephanie ...
- Carl.

68
00:03:46,754 --> 00:03:47,496
Peter

69
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:49,540
Stephanie, guys.
- Hey

70
00:03:50,632 --> 00:03:51,953
This is my boyfriend, Ted.

71
00:03:52,773 --> 00:03:55,448
I don't believe we've....
- No, I don't believe we have.

72
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,595
You're leaving?
- Yeah, unfortunately.

73
00:03:58,644 --> 00:04:00,859
Terrible timing too, because you just got here.

74
00:04:01,072 --> 00:04:02,923
You just got here too, Carl.

75
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:08,756
Yes, but he's got a thing.
- Yeah, that's a thing. There's a thing and uh...

76
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:11,919
There's no time. There's a time crunch,
and time is of the essence.

77
00:04:12,265 --> 00:04:15,512
Anyway, I am gone-a-rea.

78
00:04:17,778 --> 00:04:20,568
Wow, that didn't sound quite right..
Oh well. - Woah!

79
00:04:30,762 --> 00:04:31,882
See you, guys.

80
00:04:51,518 --> 00:04:54,157
Hi, Tillie.
- Good morning, Carl.

81
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:58,694
Would you like to come over for breakfast?
- That sounds great, but I can't.

82
00:04:58,806 --> 00:05:01,782
Some cereal, a yogurt, or something?
- Yes, I know.

83
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,542
How about some toast?
- I have to go to work, but thanks.

84
00:05:06,412 --> 00:05:08,526
A good show tonight.
Come check us out.

85
00:05:09,504 --> 00:05:10,675
Hey man, want to rock out tonight?

86
00:05:10,741 --> 00:05:14,256
Oh, it's you. Let me guess, no?
- Yes

87
00:05:14,549 --> 00:05:17,124
Yes?
- No, I meant 'yes' to your 'no'.

88
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,625
Oh, yeah, fine.

89
00:05:20,758 --> 00:05:24,830
Persianwifefinder.com
No, thank you.

90
00:05:25,065 --> 00:05:27,951
Costume party?
- Yea... No.

91
00:05:29,552 --> 00:05:30,352
Oh boy.

92
00:05:33,842 --> 00:05:35,323
Here we go.

93
00:05:35,618 --> 00:05:37,978
Carl Allen has reported for duty?

94
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,772
I'm not a soldier, Norman.

95
00:05:40,224 --> 00:05:42,471
You are a soldier
on the front line of finance.

96
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:45,697
Norman - Line 1.

97
00:05:46,343 --> 00:05:50,079
You want to get that in the privacy of your office?
- No, I'll just get it here.

98
00:05:52,355 --> 00:05:53,659
You're with Norman.

99
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:56,816
Are you sure, because ...

100
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,121
Ok.

101
00:05:58,717 --> 00:05:59,769
Whatever you say.

102
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,257
Remember that promotion we were talking about?

103
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,158
Yeah.

104
00:06:05,277 --> 00:06:06,563
That's not going to happen.

105
00:06:06,637 --> 00:06:08,436
I tried to fight for you
on the phone there.

106
00:06:08,537 --> 00:06:10,137
It was between you and
Demco and they went with Demco.

107
00:06:10,936 --> 00:06:12,501
I don't care.

108
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:14,162
I didn't really want the job badly.

109
00:06:14,262 --> 00:06:17,330
I just figured after 5 years I'd be the
logical choice, but whatever.

110
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:20,197
Well hey, look at it this way.
At least you didn't get shitcanned.

111
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,566
You know what that means?
- Fired?

112
00:06:24,059 --> 00:06:27,293
Oh, how did you know what that means?
You heard me say that before?

113
00:06:27,423 --> 00:06:29,373
No, it's a pretty common expression.

114
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,003
In my circles. I made it up.

115
00:06:32,152 --> 00:06:34,041
It is catching on.

116
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:36,829
This will cheer you up
I'm having a get-together at my place.

117
00:06:36,941 --> 00:06:39,699
It's a funny hat and/or wig party.

118
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,700
Oh, man!

119
00:06:41,807 --> 00:06:43,524
Sucks I'm going to be out of town.

120
00:06:43,706 --> 00:06:46,243
You don't know what day it is.
- When is it?

121
00:06:46,247 --> 00:06:47,937
Friday.
- I'm out of town.

122
00:06:47,968 --> 00:06:49,826
You spoke at the same time I did.

123
00:06:49,894 --> 00:06:53,526
It was almost as if you were committed to what
you said regardless of what I was going to say.

124
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:54,627
Hmmm?

125
00:06:56,694 --> 00:07:00,074
I admit business has been slow.
I mean, there's a lot less demand

126
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,668
for a small rollerblade shop,
what with Big 5 and Sport's Chalet,

127
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:06,169
but my designs are going to
revolutionize the roller industry

128
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,766
I know Marv,
but you have no equity.

129
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:13,534
And your credit ...
- It's bad

130
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,610
but I don't want to sound desperate.

131
00:07:16,084 --> 00:07:18,096
I have no other options left

132
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:20,472
Rejected.

133
00:07:20,652 --> 00:07:22,332
Unknown caller
- Ignore.

134
00:07:28,558 --> 00:07:31,099
Carl. Hey, long time no see.

135
00:07:31,215 --> 00:07:31,693
Nick Lane?

136
00:07:31,794 --> 00:07:32,694
Hey

137
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:36,252
You don't still work at the bank, do you?

138
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,569
Yeah, kind of why I'm sitting outside here,
eating lunch, wearing the name tag.

139
00:07:41,148 --> 00:07:43,408
You must be running this place by now.

140
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:46,559
I could have been. I had a couple offers.
I didn't want to get tied down.

141
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,304
How is Stephanie?
- Good God!

142
00:07:50,645 --> 00:07:52,162
She's good.

143
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:55,233
What have you been doing?
- I've been all over the map man.

144
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:58,010
I have lived.
I climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro.

145
00:07:58,113 --> 00:08:01,487
I ate a bat in Laos.
I shot a cow with a bazooka.

146
00:08:01,586 --> 00:08:04,504
I'm not proud of that last one,
but I did it, man.

147
00:08:04,664 --> 00:08:07,164
Wow, that sounds wild.
- You want to know my secret?

148
00:08:08,752 --> 00:08:10,406
I'm a Yes Man.

149
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:14,689
The word "Yes" has changed my life. Here.
- No, thanks. I'm fine.

150
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:18,188
Fine? I wipe my ass with Fine.
- Wow. Okay.

151
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:21,964
You don't want to work here Carl.
- Yeah I do.

152
00:08:23,008 --> 00:08:24,489
No, you don't.

153
00:08:25,992 --> 00:08:29,890
Why don't you take this rock and throw it
at that bank & shatter the window the window?

154
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,154
No, thanks.
- Ask me if I want to do.

155
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,664
Do you want to throw that rock at the bank?
- Yes

156
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:41,970
Are you crazy?
- Go to this reunion, Carl.

157
00:08:42,109 --> 00:08:44,059
Stay where you are.

158
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,856
Carl, live your life.
You won't regret it.

159
00:08:10,621 --> 00:08:14,608
The word "Yes" has changed my life. Here.
- No, thanks. I'm fine.

160
00:08:14,753 --> 00:08:18,107
'Fine'? I wipe my ass with 'Fine'.
- Wow. Okay.

161
00:08:18,335 --> 00:08:21,883
You don't want to work here Carl.
- Yeah I do.

162
00:08:22,926 --> 00:08:24,408
No, you don't.

163
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:29,807
Why don't you take this rock and throw it
at that bank & shatter the window the window?

164
00:08:30,751 --> 00:08:33,071
No, thanks.
- Ask me if I want to do.

165
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:36,580
Do you want to throw that rock at the bank?
- Yes

166
00:08:39,043 --> 00:08:41,886
Are you crazy?
- Go to this reunion, Carl.

167
00:08:42,024 --> 00:08:43,974
Stay where you are.

168
00:08:49,174 --> 00:08:52,770
Carl, live your life.
You won't regret it!

169
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,069
Unknown caller.
Ignore.

170
00:09:05,488 --> 00:09:07,561
You wanna see my band?
- No.

171
00:09:08,484 --> 00:09:09,205
Sorry.

172
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,561
Declined.

173
00:09:11,895 --> 00:09:13,607
Stephanie?
- Carl.

174
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:16,587
Yeah, it's me.
I just felt like calling you.

175
00:09:17,027 --> 00:09:19,442
I was missing you I guess. Weird, huh?

176
00:09:19,849 --> 00:09:22,891
Yes, Carl. I have to go.
Ted and I are taking a little boat ride.

177
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,653
Oh, that's great. Good for you.

178
00:09:37,603 --> 00:09:40,288
Jesus, Pete.
I'm not in or I'm busy.

179
00:09:46,842 --> 00:09:50,123
Oh come on. You're halfway through.
Just snap it off already.

180
00:09:58,048 --> 00:10:01,983
Hi, Pete. Hey. Where have you been?
- You haven't been getting my calls?

181
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:03,070
What?

182
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:06,509
God, no.
Oh, I totally lost my phone.

183
00:10:06,311 --> 00:10:07,802
You are so full of shit.

184
00:10:08,121 --> 00:10:09,325
Here it is.

185
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:10,926
Yeah, there it is.

186
00:10:11,321 --> 00:10:15,080
You know what buddy?
You missed my engagement party tonight.

187
00:10:15,252 --> 00:10:18,934
Oh no. Oh shoot. You are kidding?
That was tonight?

188
00:10:19,794 --> 00:10:23,872
I am so sorry. I totally gapped it.
Listen, I'll make it up to you. I promise.

189
00:10:23,982 --> 00:10:27,482
I swear. You pick the day. Any day you
want. We'll go out. We'll swashbuckle.

190
00:10:27,619 --> 00:10:30,064
What does that even mean?
- I don't know.

191
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,939
This wasn't drinks at a bar, Carl.
This was my engagement party.

192
00:10:34,065 --> 00:10:37,107
You only get married once.
- I certainly wouldn't do it again.

193
00:10:37,134 --> 00:10:41,216
I know, Carl. I know that Stephanie left
and I know that you have issues because of it

194
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:43,899
but this isn't about you.
It's about me.

195
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:47,011
When was the last time you did anything fun?
You're always makinmg excuses.

196
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:49,233
'I don't want to commit.'
'I don't want to be tied down.'

197
00:10:49,777 --> 00:10:51,922
Do you even know my fiance's last name?

198
00:10:52,623 --> 00:10:53,529
Yeah, Fisher.

199
00:10:53,627 --> 00:10:55,096
Fishman.

200
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:58,648
Wait ... Fish Wall?
- Fish Wall?

201
00:10:59,213 --> 00:11:02,585
You think her name is Lucy Fish Wall?
- No, that's wrong.

202
00:11:02,681 --> 00:11:06,459
It's Burns.
It's Lucy Burns, Carl.

203
00:11:06,552 --> 00:11:09,775
And guess what?
She doesn't like my best friend.

204
00:11:09,896 --> 00:11:12,344
And I keep trying to think of reasons
why she should, but you know what?

205
00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:13,961
I can't think of any.

206
00:11:14,535 --> 00:11:17,551
I don't want to hear another excuse, Carl.
Do what you want,

207
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,945
I'm just telling you, that if you don't change
your life, you're going to end up a lonely guy.

208
00:11:21,146 --> 00:11:23,710
A lonely guy, Carl.

209
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:32,653
Hey, Carl.

210
00:11:36,443 --> 00:11:38,221
Hey, Rooney. Come here for a second.

211
00:11:41,315 --> 00:11:42,865
Carl look a little odd to you?

212
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,137
Is it me, or does it look like he's kind of dead?

213
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,047
Nope, no more than usual.

214
00:11:49,235 --> 00:11:53,113
I do not know. I'm leaning towards
thinking he might actually be dead dead.

215
00:11:54,855 --> 00:11:57,999
I guess I never saw him a lot
so it's hard for me to tell the difference.

216
00:11:58,255 --> 00:11:59,859
Yeah, that's true.

217
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,160
He never did much.

218
00:12:02,468 --> 00:12:05,824
He wasn't a good friend.
Wasn't a good anything.

219
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,099
Any more beers in the fridge?

220
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:10,502
Sorry, this was the last one.

221
00:12:10,872 --> 00:12:12,522
That's pathetic.

222
00:12:17,423 --> 00:12:18,623
What was that?

223
00:13:02,451 --> 00:13:04,394
<i> As we begin. </i>

224
00:13:04,555 --> 00:13:07,199
<i> Find a seat. </i>

225
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,400
Carl. Hey Carl.

226
00:13:10,101 --> 00:13:11,201
Carl, man, hey!

227
00:13:12,102 --> 00:13:13,102
Hey Nick.

228
00:13:15,091 --> 00:13:16,355
You made it man.

229
00:13:17,955 --> 00:13:21,457
I knew you'd come. I saw it
in your eyes, man. You're gonna love this.

230
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:25,290
Terrence is genius. He's going to
blow your mind all over the Goddamn room.

231
00:13:25,397 --> 00:13:28,315
He's like a frickin mind grenade.
- I'm not sure I want that.

232
00:13:28,553 --> 00:13:30,970
Yeah, but you need it.
That's why you're here.

233
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:34,965
You have got to start saying 'yes',
my man. And I mean to everything.

234
00:13:34,985 --> 00:13:35,934
Shh, it's starting.

235
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:41,577
<i> Life. We are all living it. .</i>

236
00:13:42,024 --> 00:13:44,436
<i> Or are we?
- Eww, heavy </i>

237
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:50,790
<i> Change is generated from consciousness
but where is consciousness generated from? </i>

238
00:13:50,868 --> 00:13:52,715
<i> From the external .</i>

239
00:13:53,002 --> 00:13:55,860
<i> And how do we control the external?</i>

240
00:13:55,967 --> 00:13:59,043
<i> With one word. And what is that word? </i>

241
00:13:59,113 --> 00:14:00,672
Yes!

242
00:14:19,153 --> 00:14:21,441
The word is' yes'.

243
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,772
Yes, yes, yes.

244
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:27,058
Say it a million times.

245
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:32,400
Say it a million more times. And the
word you will have said two million times is ...

246
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:34,375
Yes!

247
00:14:42,689 --> 00:14:47,389
I want you to invite 'Yes' into your life,

248
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:52,501
Because it will rsvp 'Yes'.

249
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:57,725
When you say 'Yes' to things,
you embrace the possible.

250
00:14:58,249 --> 00:15:04,539
You've gobbled up all of life's energies
and you excrete the waste.

251
00:15:05,492 --> 00:15:10,682
Before we begin today, I'd
like to welcome our new members.

252
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,035
Who among you is new?

253
00:15:15,178 --> 00:15:18,109
He is! This guy right here!. He's new.

254
00:15:18,142 --> 00:15:19,758
Over here.

255
00:15:20,406 --> 00:15:23,877
Come on up,
future 'Yes' man.

256
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,330
That's okay, I'm just auditing.

257
00:15:29,538 --> 00:15:32,288
You can't audit life my friend.

258
00:15:32,445 --> 00:15:35,812
Now, get on up here.
- No, thanks. I'm cool.

259
00:15:36,108 --> 00:15:39,178
I'm sorry? What was that you said?

260
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,146
Um, I said I'm cool.

261
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,716
Before that?

262
00:15:46,228 --> 00:15:50,466
Thank you.
- Back up just a little bit more.

263
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:54,359
No.
- "No man! No man! ..."

264
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,657
Okay.

265
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:03,571
If the mole hill won't come to Terrence,

266
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:06,759
Terrence will come to the mole hill.

267
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:18,746
What is your name?
- Carl.

268
00:16:19,334 --> 00:16:23,529
Let me guess, Carl. Someone
talked you into coming here, didn't they?

269
00:16:24,504 --> 00:16:26,838
Yes
- 'Yes!'

270
00:16:27,151 --> 00:16:30,261
And you're not sure about this, are you?

271
00:16:31,331 --> 00:16:34,397
No.
- "No, man! No man! ..."

272
00:16:36,075 --> 00:16:38,357
You are dead, Carl.

273
00:16:38,505 --> 00:16:41,951
You say no to life
and therefore you are not living.

274
00:16:42,062 --> 00:16:44,896
You make up excuses
to the people around you

275
00:16:45,057 --> 00:16:50,207
and to yourself.
You are stuck in the same deadend job.

276
00:16:50,657 --> 00:16:54,288
You do not have a girlfriend.
You don't have anything close to a girlfriend.

277
00:16:54,712 --> 00:16:59,702
And you lost the love of your life because
she couldn't be with someone who didn't live theirs.

278
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,903
(silently mouths) Wow.

279
00:17:02,645 --> 00:17:06,794
And on most nights you are so bored
and filled with ennui

280
00:17:06,908 --> 00:17:11,291
you can't even sumon the
enthusiasm necessary to masterbate.

281
00:17:11,642 --> 00:17:13,668
Am I right, Carl?

282
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:21,869
I have some trouble.

283
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:30,582
We can make a covenent, Carl.

284
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,246
Do you want to make a covenent?

285
00:17:33,347 --> 00:17:34,547
Um..

286
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:38,897
The word is' yes', Carl.
- "Yes!" "Yes! Yes!"

287
00:17:41,575 --> 00:17:44,305
Once you leave this building...

288
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:48,675
every time an opportunity presents itself

289
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:53,330
No matter what it is,
you will say: 'Yes'.

290
00:17:53,631 --> 00:17:55,931
"Yes! Yes! ..."

291
00:17:59,326 --> 00:18:05,763
What if I say the other word?

292
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:13,259
You will be a promise to yourself.
When you break a promise to yourself

293
00:18:13,975 --> 00:18:17,409
things can get a little dicy.

294
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:19,599
What do you say, Carl?

295
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:23,013
Are you ready to make a covenent?

296
00:18:23,804 --> 00:18:26,685
Yes
- "Yes! Yes!..."

297
00:18:27,369 --> 00:18:29,236
Again.
-Yes.

298
00:18:29,743 --> 00:18:30,860
Say it again.
- "Yes!"

299
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:37,684
Make me believe it!
- Yes! Yes! Yes!.

300
00:18:40,985 --> 00:18:42,085
"YES!"

301
00:19:09,556 --> 00:19:11,889
Hey, there he is.
- Hey, that was really wonderful.

302
00:19:11,928 --> 00:19:14,398
Thank you.
- That was pretty powerful stuff, huh?

303
00:19:14,578 --> 00:19:15,979
Good to have you with us.

304
00:19:16,261 --> 00:19:20,270
So, are you going to do it?
- I do not know. Maybe.

305
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:23,908
This is weird. I didn't realize we just
stepped out of a 'Maybe' seminar.

306
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:32,476
Hey, that's a nice car.
Could you drive me to to Elysian Park?

307
00:19:32,677 --> 00:19:33,577
Oh, uh...

308
00:19:35,037 --> 00:19:40,621
Yeah, sure he can.
Right, Carl?

309
00:19:43,887 --> 00:19:45,876
Yeah, why not.

310
00:19:46,297 --> 00:19:50,236
Yes!
You won't regret this, Carl.

311
00:19:54,682 --> 00:19:59,291
Can I use your phone?
- Come on, man.

312
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:30,309
Keep going or this will do?
Does it really matter?

313
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:33,358
Hold on a second
I can't hear myself think.

314
00:20:33,459 --> 00:20:34,759
Just a little further.
Just right up the hill there.

315
00:20:36,554 --> 00:20:37,502
Go ahead.

316
00:20:42,253 --> 00:20:45,666
I'm just right over here.
Okay, yeah.

317
00:20:47,443 --> 00:20:49,316
What? Hello?

318
00:20:49,723 --> 00:20:52,567
Aw shit, man. Your battery is dead.

319
00:20:52,868 --> 00:20:53,768
Aw, great.

320
00:20:55,561 --> 00:20:56,674
Thanks.

321
00:20:57,879 --> 00:21:02,998
Gracias amigo. It was real nice of you
to give me a ride. Most people just say no.

322
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:06,762
Of course i have been having a lot
of luck lately outside of that hotel.

323
00:21:07,002 --> 00:21:08,757
No problem. Have a good night.

324
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:11,843
Can I borrow a couple bucks?

325
00:21:14,264 --> 00:21:15,456
Ok.

326
00:21:16,544 --> 00:21:18,267
I came this far.

327
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,948
Yes, you can.

328
00:21:22,071 --> 00:21:24,656
You havea whole lot there.
Can I have it all?

329
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:31,221
Sure.

330
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:33,200
All yours.

331
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,096
God bless you man.

332
00:21:59,093 --> 00:22:00,482
Come on, now.

333
00:22:01,622 --> 00:22:03,560
Come on.

334
00:22:07,751 --> 00:22:09,233
Perfect.

335
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:14,136
Hey Carl? Do you want to give all your
money away to a homelss guy? Yes, yes I do.

336
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,783
How about letting hm
burn out your phone battery

337
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,584
so you can't call 'Triple A'
when you run out of gas?

338
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:21,277
You know what?
That sounds like a fucking great idea!

339
00:22:21,692 --> 00:22:25,751
Why not take a late night stroll
through the hills and get killed by the Manson family?

340
00:22:25,847 --> 00:22:27,496
Don't mind if I do!

341
00:22:44,141 --> 00:22:45,809
Come on, man.

342
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,650
Credit.
Click yes or no.

343
00:22:49,228 --> 00:22:50,197
My only fucking option

344
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:10,469
Would you like to carry a 20 lb
container of gas up a giant hill to your car?

345
00:23:10,591 --> 00:23:13,956
Oh, could I? Could I really?

346
00:23:14,835 --> 00:23:16,976
That's a good look.

347
00:23:17,377 --> 00:23:18,277
Oh, hi.

348
00:23:20,092 --> 00:23:22,247
Did you just take my picture?
- Maybe.

349
00:23:23,117 --> 00:23:26,562
Did you just run out of gas?
- Maybe.

350
00:23:27,952 --> 00:23:29,390
That sucks.

351
00:23:29,801 --> 00:23:31,802
That happened to me last week.

352
00:23:31,975 --> 00:23:34,424
When you were driving rediculously far
out of your way to drop off a homeless guy

353
00:23:34,475 --> 00:23:37,125
who wore out your phone battery
so you couldn't call 'Triple A'

354
00:23:37,756 --> 00:23:41,418
Uh, no. I take it that's what happened to you.
- No.

355
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,400
Why do you assume that?

356
00:23:44,661 --> 00:23:47,310
He used up your phone?
- Yes

357
00:23:47,521 --> 00:23:50,236
Apparently he was the most
popular homeless man on the planet.

358
00:23:50,266 --> 00:23:52,782
He was staying connected.
It was good to see.

359
00:23:53,055 --> 00:23:57,051
I'm just glad that I could be a part of it
- That must feel good.

360
00:23:57,429 --> 00:24:01,363
Oh, truly. And I'm geting
some excersize, which is cool.

361
00:24:01,842 --> 00:24:05,624
Well, do you need a ride?
- On that thing?

362
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,424
Am I going too fast for you?
- No, In fact I think you should go faster.

363
00:24:21,589 --> 00:24:24,181
That way if we crash at least I'll die..

364
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:26,829
I don't want to be kept alive artificially.

365
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:37,051
What are you doing?

366
00:24:37,357 --> 00:24:40,131
I'm taking a picture. Smile.

367
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:45,499
I can't see. I'm blind.
- Me too. Isn't it great?

368
00:24:58,098 --> 00:25:00,069
Yes, that's getting it good.

369
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:05,840
Thanks again for the ride.
- No, problem.

370
00:25:05,981 --> 00:25:09,831
Hopefully the color
will return to your face sometime soon.

371
00:25:10,132 --> 00:25:12,490
I'm more of a four wheel kind of guy.
- Really?

372
00:25:12,604 --> 00:25:16,312
I never would have guessed that.
You seem so at ease on two.

373
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,758
Can I have my helmet back now?

374
00:25:19,997 --> 00:25:22,123
I'm still wearing it aren't I?

375
00:25:24,182 --> 00:25:25,512
Thanks.

376
00:25:27,281 --> 00:25:29,451
Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

377
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:32,238
Unless you want to stick around and make out?
- What?

378
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:34,011
What did you say?

379
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:38,735
Hey, I ...

380
00:25:44,282 --> 00:25:46,012
Have a good night.

381
00:26:10,013 --> 00:26:11,013
Nice.

382
00:26:20,003 --> 00:26:23,249
"Yes" always leads to something good.

383
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,300
Hello

384
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,826
<i> Carl, it's your buddy, Norman  .</i>

385
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,356
And your boss,
but more your buddy than your boss right?

386
00:26:41,277 --> 00:26:43,017
I guess.

387
00:26:44,005 --> 00:26:48,332
So, we're kind of short on Sat staff.
Is there any way you could come in?

388
00:26:49,512 --> 00:26:54,121
Sure. Nothing I like better than
the inside of a bank on a beautiful Saturday.

389
00:26:54,382 --> 00:26:57,646
Yeah, there really is
something magical about this place.

390
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:05,911
Would I like to increase the size of my penis?

391
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,569
Right.

392
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:10,704
Like I need that.

393
00:27:14,707 --> 00:27:16,255
Persian-wife finder

394
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:21,823
Hi. I am Faranoosh
Would you be the man for me?

395
00:27:22,361 --> 00:27:23,735
I guess so.

396
00:27:25,055 --> 00:27:26,279
Excuse me.

397
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,080
I'd like to apply for a small business loan.
- And what is your business?

398
00:27:29,701 --> 00:27:32,592
I bake cakes in the shape of
different celebrities' faces.

399
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:36,979
Wow, Mickey Rourke.
- No, it's Bono.

400
00:27:38,778 --> 00:27:41,697
Yeah, right.
Let's hope it doesn't taste like Mickey Rourke.

401
00:27:43,766 --> 00:27:45,751
So what do you think?

402
00:27:48,343 --> 00:27:49,980
I think yes

403
00:27:50,626 --> 00:27:51,677
Accepted.

404
00:27:54,832 --> 00:28:02,067
Interesting. Cakes, huh?
- Yes, I just kind of went with my gut on it, Norm.

405
00:28:02,797 --> 00:28:06,248
You called me Norm.
Could that be like my nickname?

406
00:28:06,586 --> 00:28:11,685
Yeah, I guess.
- Nice. I like your style, Car

407
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:14,922
That can be yours.
- Carl is pretty short already, but ...

408
00:28:15,032 --> 00:28:17,612
You could say it's the kind of
detail we need around here.

409
00:28:17,936 --> 00:28:19,649
You know what I did?
- What?

410
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:22,015
That whole Demco thing really chapped my ass.

411
00:28:22,135 --> 00:28:27,104
I marched upstairs and told the big guns
Carl gets promoted in leiu of Demco

412
00:28:27,245 --> 00:28:29,220
or along with Demco, whichever.

413
00:28:29,412 --> 00:28:33,334
or I walk.
- Really? What did thay say?

414
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:36,900
Well, they were quite attracted to the me
walking option, you know, for a moment.

415
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,421
but then I threw that off the table.
- Good move.

416
00:28:39,528 --> 00:28:43,245
And I said if you started to show
some initiative I could promote you.

417
00:28:43,533 --> 00:28:45,645
And?
- Well you are doing it!

418
00:28:46,137 --> 00:28:47,729
Yeah, the whole cake thing.
- Yeah

419
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,330
You're making up nicknames.

420
00:28:49,753 --> 00:28:53,003
You know what? I called Demco this
morning to ask if he could work on Saturday.

421
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,126
You know what he said?
- No.

422
00:28:55,289 --> 00:28:57,635
How did you know that?
- He's not here.

423
00:28:57,787 --> 00:29:02,344
Oh yeah, but you are Car
And that's why I'm giving the job to you

424
00:29:03,287 --> 00:29:08,435
Norm, that's amazing. My God. Thank you.
- I saw the raise in it for you too.

425
00:29:08,576 --> 00:29:11,662
Bump up your salary to sixty-five.
- Thousand?

426
00:29:11,868 --> 00:29:15,420
Of course, thousand.
Come one let's take this thing up a notch broseph.

427
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:23,210
See what I did there? I joined "bro" with
"Joseph": "Broseph". Pretty cool, huh?

428
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:26,436
Very cool, Norm.

429
00:29:30,242 --> 00:29:33,217
I have been such a dick and a douche.

430
00:29:33,537 --> 00:29:37,716
More of a douche than a dick probably.
I'm sorry. I should have been there.

431
00:29:37,728 --> 00:29:40,316
I mean really.
- You're preaching to the choir, Carl..

432
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:46,041
I'm telling you man. Things are different.
- So wait, you have to say yes to everything?

433
00:29:46,397 --> 00:29:50,775
Yeah, exactly. It's like you said, I wasn't open
to stuff, and now that I am, things are changing for me.

434
00:29:50,845 --> 00:29:53,747
It's like, the era of yes has begun.

435
00:29:53,883 --> 00:29:56,668
Alright. Look, if it gets you
out of the house I'm all for it.

436
00:29:56,738 --> 00:29:59,016
Excuse me. can we get another round of drinks.

437
00:29:59,171 --> 00:30:04,189
Actually, we're going to start a tab, and our
good friend here, Carl Allen, will be taking care of it.

438
00:30:05,748 --> 00:30:10,236
You're okay with that right buddy?
- Yes, yes I am.

439
00:30:10,337 --> 00:30:11,437
Okay

440
00:30:15,131 --> 00:30:18,933
I should be prepping my piece for Mon,
but I cannot miss this.

441
00:30:19,263 --> 00:30:21,817
Hey, yo, another bump of hot sauce.

442
00:30:23,866 --> 00:30:27,622
Oh boy, you guys are really into this shit.

443
00:31:12,051 --> 00:31:13,734
Carl, that was so awesome.

444
00:31:14,694 --> 00:31:17,806
Excuse me, can I ...
- Absolutely.

445
00:31:18,065 --> 00:31:20,405
I do not think that's
what she was asking for, but ...

446
00:31:20,506 --> 00:31:21,306
Alright.

447
00:31:24,978 --> 00:31:27,040
Was I chewing gum before?

448
00:31:28,356 --> 00:31:32,116
What do you think you're doing asshole?
- Easy, hey. There's a little misunderstanding.

449
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:37,105
I was just saying yes to life.
You gotta say yes to life.

450
00:31:37,424 --> 00:31:40,312
I made a sacred covenent.

451
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:42,885
That sounded naughty.

452
00:31:43,275 --> 00:31:45,967
I think you and I need to step outside.
- No. God no, it's ...

453
00:31:46,065 --> 00:31:48,174
Okay. It's okay.

454
00:31:48,298 --> 00:31:49,417
I got this.

455
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:55,689
But if I win, I get to take that
pretty girl of yours to a ball.

456
00:31:56,232 --> 00:31:58,295
Because she deserves that.

457
00:31:58,578 --> 00:32:02,144
Every prety girl deserves
to go to a ball.

458
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:04,714
That is so nice.

459
00:32:13,588 --> 00:32:16,130
You punched me right in the face, man.

460
00:32:16,195 --> 00:32:18,311
Come on, I got your back.
- You don't have anybody's back.

461
00:32:18,552 --> 00:32:23,075
I'm sorry man, it's all our fault.
- I haven't gotten in a fight since grade 7.

462
00:32:23,586 --> 00:32:26,437
Hey, are we going to fight or what?
- Yeah, we're going to fight.

463
00:32:26,651 --> 00:32:31,366
We're going to fight alright.
Okay, you want some eh?

464
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:32,967
Because I'm open for business, okay?

465
00:32:33,688 --> 00:32:36,835
Where did I go?

466
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,577
How do you fight what you can't see?

467
00:32:39,928 --> 00:32:43,192
Did you see 'The Legend of Billy Jack'?

468
00:32:43,608 --> 00:32:49,611
Because i'm going to take this foot and
I'm going to whop you on that side of your face.

469
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:53,084
And there's not a goddamn
thing you can do about it.

470
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:59,241
Just don't break my teeth off on the curb okay?
Let's really sell this. Give'em a show.

471
00:32:59,869 --> 00:33:00,882
What?

472
00:33:01,047 --> 00:33:05,196
First we have to establish the ground rules.

473
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:10,028
And the ground rules are
there are no ground rules.

474
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:14,541
Idiot.

475
00:33:14,721 --> 00:33:18,905
I am wrong guy.
- Maybe you need to start being the right guy.

476
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:23,928
That's why you got punched out. Because
you got the wrong attitude right out of the gate.

477
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,420
I'm over here, dickhole.

478
00:33:26,051 --> 00:33:31,315
Oh my God, that's so funny.
- You're a complete...

479
00:33:33,132 --> 00:33:34,080
Are you alright?

480
00:33:36,068 --> 00:33:36,800
I almost blocked it.
I just didn't get there in time.

481
00:33:37,035 --> 00:33:40,366
Look, we've been drinking.
He's really been drinking.

482
00:33:40,467 --> 00:33:41,967
Seriously, I'm glad we had this experience.

483
00:33:42,662 --> 00:33:44,850
I think we both grew from it.

484
00:33:45,251 --> 00:33:47,151
Call me.
- Asshole!

485
00:33:56,976 --> 00:33:59,388
Oh, she's never going to go to a ball.

486
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:01,923
No, she's not.

487
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,530
Okay, Tillie. There you are.

488
00:34:35,645 --> 00:34:38,273
Hi Carl.
- What can I do for you?

489
00:34:38,352 --> 00:34:41,674
I was wondering if you could
help me put up some shelves?

490
00:34:42,303 --> 00:34:44,446
Oh really?

491
00:34:50,451 --> 00:34:54,880
Okay, that should just about do it.

492
00:34:55,181 --> 00:34:58,725
I'll see you later, Tillie.
- That was wonderful, Carl.

493
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:01,948
Not so fast.

494
00:35:02,822 --> 00:35:04,206
Oh, what are you doing?

495
00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:08,692
Damn, I forgot to go to the bank.
- Never mind.

496
00:35:08,823 --> 00:35:11,143
I am getting so forgetful.

497
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,423
That happens with age.
- Don't worry about it.

498
00:35:14,569 --> 00:35:17,364
I am going to have to repay you somehow.

499
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:21,281
Oh, just doing a favor for a neighbor's
good enough for me.

500
00:35:22,568 --> 00:35:25,217
You are so handsome.

501
00:35:25,895 --> 00:35:29,269
How come I never see you with a girl?

502
00:35:29,783 --> 00:35:34,571
Well, I'm not in a
serious thing but I am dating.

503
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:38,301
Would you like a release?
- I'm sorry?

504
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:40,751
You know, sexual release?

505
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,576
What do we do here?

506
00:35:45,005 --> 00:35:50,761
You don't have to do anything, Carl. You
just lay back, and I'll take care of everything.

507
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:53,785
I do not know what to say.
I'm stumped. Baffled.

508
00:35:54,771 --> 00:35:57,406
I don't know if I'm going
to be able to say yes to this one.

509
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:00,706
Thanks for the offer
and the image.

510
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:04,950
I got this thing i gotta do, so.
I'll be seeing you.

511
00:36:06,644 --> 00:36:09,440
Nightmares.

512
00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:13,141
Oh, come on. Give me a break.

513
00:36:14,076 --> 00:36:16,351
Terrence said this would happen if I said no.

514
00:36:16,389 --> 00:36:18,718
That's ridiculous.

515
00:36:18,827 --> 00:36:21,838
If I want to say no, I'll say no.

516
00:36:35,773 --> 00:36:36,998
Nice dog.

517
00:36:47,601 --> 00:36:51,077
Just relax. I'll handle this..

518
00:36:57,339 --> 00:36:59,186
Oh God!

519
00:37:05,393 --> 00:37:10,246
Oh, wow. That was ...

520
00:37:10,692 --> 00:37:12,425
How can you do that?

521
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:22,338
Costume party. Come as
your favorite Harry Potter character.

522
00:37:22,489 --> 00:37:24,241
You got it, Norm.

523
00:38:13,105 --> 00:38:15,222
Really? I always wanted to try it.

524
00:38:16,303 --> 00:38:19,497
So I can expecy delivery anytime
between 8 am and 5:30?

525
00:38:20,179 --> 00:38:24,615
We were wondering if you had a moment to
discuss the Church of Jesus Christ and the L.D.S.?

526
00:38:24,762 --> 00:38:25,698
Yeah, come on in.

527
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,208
Buttercup Girls!
- Buttercup cookies.

528
00:38:30,967 --> 00:38:33,002
Yeah, alright.

529
00:38:35,818 --> 00:38:38,014
Hey, it's really working!

530
00:38:44,038 --> 00:38:46,427
It's beautiful, man.

531
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,538
I do want to take guitar lessons..
I do want to learn to fly.

532
00:38:50,622 --> 00:38:51,733
Yes, I would like to learn Korean.

533
00:39:01,527 --> 00:39:03,350
Alright, now I got it.

534
00:39:20,739 --> 00:39:22,599
What did he call me?

535
00:39:28,175 --> 00:39:30,147
Homeless. Hmmm?

536
00:39:31,104 --> 00:39:32,367
Come and get it.

537
00:39:35,095 --> 00:39:36,176
He never listens.

538
00:39:38,734 --> 00:39:42,273
I want to start an organic
fertilizer distribution business.

539
00:39:42,696 --> 00:39:43,980
Approved.

540
00:39:46,247 --> 00:39:47,268
Next!

541
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:51,120
Want to see ... Oh, sorry.
- You know what? I'd love to.

542
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,090
Way to stick in there.

543
00:40:12,056 --> 00:40:13,697
Here you go.

544
00:40:13,933 --> 00:40:15,857
Hey, I came.

545
00:40:16,158 --> 00:40:17,358
Great.

546
00:40:21,824 --> 00:40:22,994
Rolling Rock, please.

547
00:40:55,190 --> 00:41:00,104
Hello Jake, Penelope,
Rodrigo, Felipe, Zachary.

548
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,733
We are Munchausen by proxy.
- You're kidding me.

549
00:41:31,244 --> 00:41:33,375
Hey, did you ever meet my friend Ian?

550
00:41:33,469 --> 00:41:35,689
He is a computer hacker.

551
00:41:35,739 --> 00:41:38,791
He helped me erase your MySpace page.

552
00:41:38,805 --> 00:41:41,485
And your band's MySpace Page

553
00:41:41,592 --> 00:41:45,729
And your Facebook page.
Happy networking, asshole.

554
00:42:49,152 --> 00:42:50,797
Can I have a water?

555
00:42:55,788 --> 00:42:58,937
Hey, out of gas makeout guy.

556
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:02,326
Did we make out?
Oh, right, we did. Now I remember.

557
00:43:02,457 --> 00:43:05,606
What are you doing here?
- Is this crazy or what?

558
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,975
It's so crazy. Are you stalking me?
- No, I would never do that.

559
00:43:10,002 --> 00:43:13,184
By the way, your new LR furniture,
it looks great from the yard.

560
00:43:14,003 --> 00:43:19,006
Hey, uh, great, uh, gig, whatever
- Thanks.

561
00:43:19,077 --> 00:43:24,200
Strong lyrics. Do you just make that stuff up?
- It gots some personal experience.

562
00:43:25,154 --> 00:43:26,450
Do you want a drink?

563
00:43:26,539 --> 00:43:31,320
Oh I can't. I have to wake up early
so I have to go but ...

564
00:43:31,554 --> 00:43:32,877
Aww, really?

565
00:43:34,868 --> 00:43:37,026
But you can walk
me to my scooter.

566
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:45,168
I teach a jogging-photo group for people who
want to both exercise and practice photography.

567
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,632
Really, that's getting very popular.

568
00:43:47,943 --> 00:43:52,076
It's in Griffith park and
we do a loop it's about 5 miles.

569
00:43:52,236 --> 00:43:54,276
At six AM.

570
00:43:54,335 --> 00:43:57,861
I haven't been up at 6AM in like...
Never..

571
00:43:58,668 --> 00:44:02,862
That's early.
- Yes, but it makes for amazing pictures.

572
00:44:03,817 --> 00:44:07,632
Okay, so you're in a band,
do the jogging-photography. What else?

573
00:44:08,006 --> 00:44:10,116
Oh, whatever I want.

574
00:44:10,407 --> 00:44:13,503
I volunteer at a shelter.
I paint a little bit.

575
00:44:13,624 --> 00:44:16,039
That's cool. I've done some charity work.

576
00:44:16,178 --> 00:44:18,472
And some nude modeling, FYI.

577
00:44:19,622 --> 00:44:22,588
That's good to know.
If I ever need to ...

578
00:44:24,462 --> 00:44:27,898
So anyway, my answer is yes.
I'd be happy to go out with you.

579
00:44:28,419 --> 00:44:30,198
I didn't ask you not.

580
00:44:30,454 --> 00:44:32,820
Could have fooled me with that
nude modeling comment.

581
00:44:32,919 --> 00:44:36,814
You said that.
- Whoever said it, it made me very uncomfortable.

582
00:44:38,912 --> 00:44:41,192
Why don't you come to my class tomorrow?

583
00:44:41,462 --> 00:44:45,292
Why don't you stop smothering me?
Seriously, way too much too soon.

584
00:44:45,457 --> 00:44:46,962
Yeah, I'd love to.

585
00:44:48,381 --> 00:44:51,455
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow, um ...

586
00:44:51,984 --> 00:44:53,237
Carl.

587
00:44:53,703 --> 00:44:55,154
Allison.

588
00:45:11,393 --> 00:45:12,361
Yeah, Rooney?

589
00:45:12,518 --> 00:45:15,327
Yo, Carl. We're hitting the clubs.
We have a case of Red Bull.

590
00:45:15,449 --> 00:45:17,839
Gonna pull an all-nighter.
You down?

591
00:45:17,939 --> 00:45:19,014
Yeah

592
00:45:26,779 --> 00:45:29,027
Okay, guys everybody ready?
Cameras loaded?

593
00:45:29,249 --> 00:45:32,231
Allison?
Do we need to use a flash?

594
00:45:32,536 --> 00:45:34,234
Not when the sun is up, Reggie.

595
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:43,968
Beautiful night, guys.

596
00:45:43,977 --> 00:45:46,915
You take it to the limit.
I respect that. Hit me on the cell this week.

597
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,359
Do it again.

598
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:52,405
Carl, if someone asks me to describe
tonight, I'll just go 's-l-o-o-w'.

599
00:45:52,629 --> 00:45:54,655
Back at ya man.
- Lee, I hardly know you

600
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:56,901
but I feel comfortable.
Look how close I'm getting.

601
00:45:57,737 --> 00:46:00,019
Hello, Allison, it's me Carl.
I'm here.

602
00:46:00,166 --> 00:46:01,730
Allison, I'm here.

603
00:46:06,671 --> 00:46:08,646
Hey, who were those guys?

604
00:46:08,687 --> 00:46:11,447
- That's Rooney and my
new friend Lee. He's a male nurse.

605
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,556
We hit a couple of raves last night.
It was totally off the hook.

606
00:46:14,585 --> 00:46:17,421
Yeah, you seem a little hyper.
- I had a couple Red Bull's.

607
00:46:17,457 --> 00:46:18,387
Have you ever had a Red Bull?

608
00:46:18,418 --> 00:46:21,088
I'd never had a Red Bull before but I had
one last night and I really like Red Bull.

609
00:46:21,151 --> 00:46:22,947
I got a new necklace.
It glows in the dark.

610
00:46:23,043 --> 00:46:25,413
but you can't really see it right now
unless you do this.

611
00:46:25,596 --> 00:46:29,114
That's really something. Doesn't
Red Bull make you crash pretty hard

612
00:46:29,415 --> 00:46:31,841
No, I don't think so. No.

613
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:35,758
Hey, after  we jog we should get a Red Bull.

614
00:46:35,831 --> 00:46:37,033
You could get a Red Bull
and I could get a Red Bull.

615
00:46:37,162 --> 00:46:38,754
We could share a Red Bull.

616
00:46:38,897 --> 00:46:40,190
Okay that would be really...
- Red Bull.

617
00:46:40,296 --> 00:46:41,426
That sounds g ...
- Red Bull.

618
00:46:41,467 --> 00:46:42,527
I think id r...
- Red Bull.

619
00:46:46,525 --> 00:46:49,571
Okay, a lot of energy. I like it.

620
00:46:49,715 --> 00:46:51,898
Everybody, this is Carl.
Carl, this is everybody.

621
00:46:52,293 --> 00:46:53,844
Hey, everybody.

622
00:46:54,306 --> 00:46:57,102
Come on.
Let's get into ship-shape.

623
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,103
Got it!

624
00:47:21,295 --> 00:47:23,215
Hey, Carl?
Are you Okay?

625
00:47:25,999 --> 00:47:27,832
Hold it right there.

626
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,238
That's good.

627
00:47:44,576 --> 00:47:48,771
I can't put my finger on you.
You're kind of unpredictable.

628
00:47:49,849 --> 00:47:51,765
Kind of mysterious.

629
00:47:52,197 --> 00:47:56,235
I like to keep it fresh.
I like to live it up. I like to mix it up.

630
00:47:56,389 --> 00:47:58,776
If that doesn't jive with you,
we should end this right now.

631
00:47:59,336 --> 00:48:00,725
I love that.

632
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:04,405
I don't know how people go through life
with the same boring routine every day.

633
00:48:04,486 --> 00:48:06,177
Just shoot me.
- Right to the face.

634
00:48:06,237 --> 00:48:09,962
Seriously, I dated this guy and I was
astounded at how perfectly content he was

635
00:48:10,046 --> 00:48:14,108
just living his life in this closed off little box.
- I know. It's so frustrating.

636
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,031
I just want to grab these people and shake'em

637
00:48:16,074 --> 00:48:19,773
and say 'wake up, you!'
'You're missing out'

638
00:48:19,926 --> 00:48:22,046
on a little thing called life.
- That's so true

639
00:48:22,386 --> 00:48:25,475
So, what happened to
closed off little box boy?

640
00:48:25,684 --> 00:48:28,558
It just didn't work out.
It's a long history.

641
00:48:29,901 --> 00:48:32,188
Same story you
were singing about last night?

642
00:48:32,756 --> 00:48:34,134
Might be.

643
00:48:35,571 --> 00:48:38,408
Closed off little boy. Tender topic.
Go no further.

644
00:48:38,443 --> 00:48:41,713
Okay, if you must know
we lived together.

645
00:48:41,825 --> 00:48:44,504
I thought he was it.
The one. Whatever.

646
00:48:44,549 --> 00:48:48,047
And then, surprise,
He ended it out of nowhere.

647
00:48:48,094 --> 00:48:50,019
for no reason, gone, never saw him again.

648
00:48:51,206 --> 00:48:53,165
Wow, that's rough. I'm sorry.

649
00:48:54,399 --> 00:48:57,588
Next time you really should warn me
about the length of the story

650
00:48:57,595 --> 00:48:59,994
It kind of dragged on there.
- I'll work on that.

651
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:01,349
Yeah, just trim the facts.

652
00:49:01,586 --> 00:49:05,236
Oh! Geeze,..
That was ... very healthy.

653
00:49:16,122 --> 00:49:20,914
She is spontaneous. She's ballsy.
She has no clue what she's doing

654
00:49:21,135 --> 00:49:23,212
and she doesn't care.
She's the complete opposite of me.

655
00:49:23,238 --> 00:49:26,793
Carl, could you please pass the Cholula?
- Sure, Faranoosh.

656
00:49:27,594 --> 00:49:31,163
How did you two meet again?
- Persianwifefinder.com

657
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:33,739
It's pretty cool,
You should check it out.

658
00:49:33,822 --> 00:49:34,789
I'm engaged.

659
00:49:34,848 --> 00:49:37,591
Should you be talking about
Allison in front of Faranoosh?

660
00:49:37,687 --> 00:49:41,057
It's okay man. We just met.
She knows it's not exclusive.

661
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:44,941
Besides, she's totally not my type.
- I can hear you.

662
00:49:45,077 --> 00:49:46,719
Oh, sorry, Faranoosh.

663
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:50,083
I never would have met Allison
if I hadn't said yes to the homeless guy.

664
00:49:50,147 --> 00:49:53,923
You also wouldn't be on a blind date with
a strange Iranian woman. No offense, Faranoosh.

665
00:49:53,937 --> 00:49:55,148
None taken.

666
00:49:55,236 --> 00:49:58,261
Wow, I didn't realize
I was dealing with a 'No' man.

667
00:49:58,489 --> 00:50:02,005
No, I think it's great.
Throw this away for me, will you?

668
00:50:09,422 --> 00:50:13,057
Lucy. Faranoosh.
- Hello.

669
00:50:14,186 --> 00:50:19,100
My friends are being really lame, and
nobody's offered to throw me a bridal shower.

670
00:50:19,823 --> 00:50:21,734
Hey, I have an idea.

671
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:24,998
Carl, would you like to
throw Lucy a bridal shower?

672
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:30,912
Yeah, sure. Why not?
That would be great. I'd love that.

673
00:50:31,382 --> 00:50:32,226
Problem solved.

674
00:50:37,641 --> 00:50:39,968
Really?
- Yes

675
00:50:40,638 --> 00:50:42,481
Well, thanks, Carl.

676
00:50:43,984 --> 00:50:47,311
That's very sweet.

677
00:50:48,126 --> 00:50:51,030
That's sweet, Carl.
- Thanks, Faranoosh.

678
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:55,330
Oh, I forgot. I've got to pick up
costumes for me and Allison.

679
00:50:55,225 --> 00:50:56,221
Costumes for what?

680
00:50:59,715 --> 00:51:03,056
Just kidding.
- That's okay, I blocked it & deflected it back.

681
00:51:03,249 --> 00:51:05,920
Kaching!
Wow, cool costume, my man.

682
00:51:06,035 --> 00:51:08,136
The only one they had left was for toddlers.

683
00:51:08,209 --> 00:51:11,769
This is Allison, with her wand
made from a sequoia.

684
00:51:12,388 --> 00:51:15,488
You must be Norman.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

685
00:51:15,545 --> 00:51:17,019
Thanks for coming.
Come in.

686
00:51:19,189 --> 00:51:24,743
We've got drinks, you know, chips, dips,

687
00:51:24,844 --> 00:51:26,463
and good people, just like you two.

688
00:51:29,014 --> 00:51:31,376
Pace yourselves
it's going to be a crazy night.

689
00:51:35,118 --> 00:51:36,945
Goal!

690
00:51:37,408 --> 00:51:40,465
Get in there, play the zone.
- Good dip, huh?

691
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:43,620
Got tons of it at Costco.

692
00:51:44,187 --> 00:51:48,112
I have an exclusive membership card and
with that card I get access to the whole place.

693
00:51:48,228 --> 00:51:51,061
I can buy large quantities
of anything at discount prices.

694
00:51:52,141 --> 00:51:56,838
Can't anyone get one of those cards?
- No, I don't think so.

695
00:51:57,021 --> 00:52:01,698
But I can talk to someone if you like.
- Yeah, put in a good word for us.

696
00:52:03,899 --> 00:52:06,397
It feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?

697
00:52:07,016 --> 00:52:08,398
I'm not going home.

698
00:52:08,705 --> 00:52:10,192
Not really.

699
00:52:19,423 --> 00:52:22,100
Alrighty gang. Who wants to watch Chamber of Secrets

700
00:52:28,583 --> 00:52:30,510
Thanks for coming.

701
00:52:30,795 --> 00:52:34,060
So nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you too. Thank you.

702
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:38,709
That's right, come in.. or go in.
And you just keep your hand there for a shake

703
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:42,194
The other hand goes around for a hug.

704
00:52:42,275 --> 00:52:46,408
Thanks for walking me through that.
- Allright   - Bye bye

705
00:52:46,521 --> 00:52:49,677
Okay, guys.
All aboard the Hogwart's Express.

706
00:52:49,814 --> 00:52:52,237
The next stop, Azkaban.

707
00:52:58,938 --> 00:53:02,638
Hey, do you want to drive?

708
00:53:09,158 --> 00:53:13,021
Hey, you're getting better.
- Yeah, not bad, huh?

709
00:53:13,795 --> 00:53:15,393
I got it.

710
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:22,492
I got an idea.

711
00:53:28,821 --> 00:53:30,405
We can't do this.

712
00:53:30,855 --> 00:53:32,602
Why, are you scared?

713
00:53:35,872 --> 00:53:39,895
Hurry, somebody's coming.
I see someone. Hurry!

714
00:53:43,422 --> 00:53:45,572
This is crazy.
- I know.

715
00:53:45,927 --> 00:53:47,244
But it's great.

716
00:54:12,679 --> 00:54:14,668
This is unreal.

717
00:54:15,342 --> 00:54:17,347
I couldn't agree more.

718
00:54:24,362 --> 00:54:27,026
# Say you don't need those diamond rings #

719
00:54:29,034 --> 00:54:31,400
# and I'd be satisfied #

720
00:54:32,507 --> 00:54:35,388
# Tell me you want those kind of things #

721
00:54:35,644 --> 00:54:37,544
# that money just can't buy #

722
00:54:39,338 --> 00:54:42,402
# I don't care too much for money #

723
00:54:42,985 --> 00:54:44,990
# money can't buy me love #

724
00:54:53,561 --> 00:54:57,189
You know I never met anyone driving a scooter before.

725
00:54:57,833 --> 00:55:01,704
I've never had anyone kiss me
on the stage of the Hollywood Bowl before.

726
00:55:25,037 --> 00:55:27,475
Good evening, Los Angeles.

727
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,989
Please welcome to the Hollywood Bowl,
'Munchausen by Proxy'

728
00:55:32,008 --> 00:55:33,588
I'm your biggest fan.

729
00:55:33,598 --> 00:55:37,277
I killed her.
I'm a somebody.

730
00:55:38,693 --> 00:55:40,546
I don't know about that.

731
00:55:40,549 --> 00:55:42,015
C'mon, you gotta have freaky fans.

732
00:55:42,316 --> 00:55:44,616
I don't think so.
We don't really have that much of a following

733
00:55:45,495 --> 00:55:48,116
What are you talking about?
There's Rodrigo and the guys at the bar.

734
00:55:48,177 --> 00:55:51,240
They can't bet trusted.
Then there's me and my friends.

735
00:55:51,253 --> 00:55:54,045
That makes eight or nine
very unstable people.

736
00:55:54,157 --> 00:55:56,493
How many people can this place even hold?

737
00:55:56,612 --> 00:55:58,071
I think 17,000.

738
00:55:58,216 --> 00:56:03,668
So each one of us invites
1800 of our closest friends.

739
00:56:03,771 --> 00:56:08,283
No need. I know our music
isn't that mainstream, but I love doing it

740
00:56:08,408 --> 00:56:10,022
It's like my photography.

741
00:56:10,139 --> 00:56:13,938
I know there isn't much demand
for blurry photos taken while running, but ...

742
00:56:14,075 --> 00:56:15,886
I wasn't going to say anything.

743
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:19,737
You know, who cares?
The world is a playground.

744
00:56:19,852 --> 00:56:24,001
You know that when you're a kid,
but somewhere along the way everyone forgets it.

745
00:56:24,854 --> 00:56:26,446
I love your music.

746
00:56:26,857 --> 00:56:29,628
Everyone can take a photo
standing still

747
00:56:30,654 --> 00:56:32,746
Hey, what are you doing?

748
00:56:32,896 --> 00:56:34,158
Shit.

749
00:56:34,219 --> 00:56:35,879
Stop.
- Stopping.

750
00:56:36,003 --> 00:56:38,246
Come on, Carl. Run!
- Oh, thanks.

751
00:56:38,365 --> 00:56:39,903
Wait right there.
- You got it.

752
00:56:40,007 --> 00:56:41,465
Down on the ground.
- Whatever you say.

753
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:46,012
Carl, what are you doing? Let's go.
- Alright. I can't please everyone.

754
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:50,195
Run!

755
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:51,926
Hello everybody.

756
00:56:52,173 --> 00:56:54,737
A little vitamin C.
Keep you straightened out.

757
00:56:55,553 --> 00:56:59,125
I will be right with you.
Pass those out, will you?

758
00:56:59,401 --> 00:57:02,590
Chapeau

759
00:57:04,119 --> 00:57:06,161
Lee?
- Hey.

760
00:57:06,411 --> 00:57:08,968
What up? My brizzo?

761
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:13,527
That is not right, is it?
- Carl, I need you for a second.

762
00:57:14,384 --> 00:57:16,020
Can you hang on a minute, Lee?

763
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,525
What is going on, Norm?

764
00:57:20,083 --> 00:57:21,821
Something going down on a big scale.

765
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:24,528
A guy from corporate is here.
Don't look.

766
00:57:24,726 --> 00:57:25,980
He wants to talk to you.

767
00:57:26,074 --> 00:57:28,457
I think it's about all those loans
you've been approving.

768
00:57:29,721 --> 00:57:32,192
Eww, well, we had a nice run.

769
00:57:32,371 --> 00:57:34,426
I might get shitcanned, Norm.

770
00:57:34,955 --> 00:57:37,867
Anyway, don't worry about it.
I'm sure it will lead to something good.

771
00:57:38,013 --> 00:57:41,893
Hey, I'm tied to this too.
I stood by and let it happen.

772
00:57:42,652 --> 00:57:45,286
When you were feeling it?
You were in the loan zone, remember?.

773
00:57:45,408 --> 00:57:46,790
Yes, I was.
- And I was watching you.

774
00:57:46,911 --> 00:57:49,553
Yeah you were.
- But I'm afraid it's caught up with us.

775
00:57:49,702 --> 00:57:52,439
Right now you and I
have to face the music. Come on.

776
00:57:52,613 --> 00:57:54,981
Can I have one minute?

777
00:57:55,913 --> 00:57:57,746
Lee, what do you need?

778
00:57:57,922 --> 00:57:59,771
It may be my last loan.

779
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:05,991
It's a Ducati. I'm thinking it will get
people off my back about the male nurse thing.

780
00:58:07,979 --> 00:58:09,881
See what I mean?
- Yeah.

781
00:58:10,744 --> 00:58:11,536
Nice ride.

782
00:58:11,658 --> 00:58:12,413
Accepted.

783
00:58:13,288 --> 00:58:15,226
See you one the other side, Lee.

784
00:58:18,341 --> 00:58:19,583
Carl.

785
00:58:22,253 --> 00:58:26,873
Wesley T. Parker. V.P. Brea Fed Savings.
- Pleasure to meet you

786
00:58:34,113 --> 00:58:38,534
Every two months the typical
loan officer approves 35 to 40 loans.

787
00:58:38,675 --> 00:58:43,398
You have given out 561.

788
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:48,187
A little more than average.
- What's even more unusual are the amounts

789
00:58:48,451 --> 00:58:51,776
A $250 loan for a mountain bike.

790
00:58:51,989 --> 00:58:56,823
$600 for windsurfing lessons.
- Have you ever tried that? It's fun.

791
00:58:56,921 --> 00:58:59,723
Carl, this bank traditionally
has never given out small loans.

792
00:59:00,143 --> 00:59:02,057
I can explain..
- Sit down, Norman.

793
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:04,802
You know at first I thought
you might be raiding our coffers.

794
00:59:04,938 --> 00:59:08,014
I would never do that.
- I would if I could so why wouldn't you?

795
00:59:17,114 --> 00:59:19,026
But then I looked closer.

796
00:59:19,414 --> 00:59:22,252
These people are so grateful
to have their needs met.

797
00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:25,378
More than 98% of them are
following through with the payments.

798
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:29,612
And because you've given out so many
of them, we're actually making a lot of money.

799
00:59:29,827 --> 00:59:32,145
Carl, these micro-loans. Not bad..

800
00:59:32,271 --> 00:59:34,209
See, Car. You worry-wart.

801
00:59:34,305 --> 00:59:37,626
Carl, what would you say if i asked you
to work upstairs with the big boys?

802
00:59:37,794 --> 00:59:41,300
Corporate?
- Wow. That's great.

803
00:59:41,518 --> 00:59:44,374
I would have to say ...
- Wait, before we give our answer ...

804
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:47,451
let's talk money. dollars and cents worth.

805
00:59:47,627 --> 00:59:50,634
I'm afraid I can't discuss that with you,
since we're only taking Carl.

806
00:59:51,746 --> 00:59:52,346
Got it.

807
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:55,669
We'll have the employment contract
to you by the end of the day.

808
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:58,408
Nice work, Carl. Bump my fist.

809
00:59:59,106 --> 01:00:02,451
Aww missed it. I was gonna fist ya.
- Here's a fist.

810
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:06,285
I especially love it in creme.
What do you think?

811
01:00:06,418 --> 01:00:09,211
I love it.

812
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:12,960
Bridal Bingo?
How to play Bridal Bingo?

813
01:00:13,285 --> 01:00:19,045
It's the same as regular bingo, but you
just use embarrassing things about the bride. Okay?

814
01:00:19,246 --> 01:00:20,246
Yeah

815
01:00:20,345 --> 01:00:23,461
No, I'm not doing Bridal Bingo.
I do not want anything complicated.

816
01:00:23,675 --> 01:00:26,114
You gotta squeeze every 
drop of juice out of this experience.

817
01:00:26,431 --> 01:00:29,081
It does not seem complicated.
Is it complicated?

818
01:00:29,318 --> 01:00:32,639
Are you going to be asking a lot of questions?
I don't got all day.

819
01:00:35,861 --> 01:00:38,857
Maybe we should just go somewhere else.
- It's okay, I'll talk to her.

820
01:00:40,264 --> 01:00:41,264
Miss...

821
01:00:41,365 --> 01:00:44,591
is there something wrong?

822
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:48,753
Yes

823
01:00:49,598 --> 01:00:51,315
There is something wrong.

824
01:00:52,311 --> 01:00:54,602
Here I am, sitting here all day long

825
01:00:54,739 --> 01:00:58,835
watching others getting engaged 
and married over and over again.

826
01:00:59,576 --> 01:01:01,716
It's just not fair! How about me?

827
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:04,567
How about Soo-Mi? When is my turn?

828
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,715
Ahh, I understand you.

829
01:01:07,002 --> 01:01:10,076
Soon your time is going to come.

830
01:01:10,313 --> 01:01:12,684
Do you see the lady who came with me?

831
01:01:13,674 --> 01:01:15,745
She is my best friend's fiancée

832
01:01:15,911 --> 01:01:17,984
and she really hates my guts.

833
01:01:18,111 --> 01:01:22,289
You'd really be hooking me up
if you helped make this fun for her.

834
01:01:22,822 --> 01:01:24,345
Let's get on the same team here.

835
01:01:24,532 --> 01:01:26,593
What do you think, Soo-Mi?

836
01:01:26,898 --> 01:01:29,242
Ok.
- Let's go for it!

837
01:01:32,101 --> 01:01:38,186
Okay, Bridal Bingo is very simple.
I can explain to you in more detail if you want.

838
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,397
I can't believe this.

839
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:42,284
There is a man on the ledge trying to jump!

840
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:44,774
What can we do?
- What's going on?

841
01:01:44,899 --> 01:01:47,003
He says someone wants to commit suicide.

842
01:01:47,088 --> 01:01:49,988
I mean, someone's trying to kill themselves.

843
01:01:50,089 --> 01:01:50,994
A jumper.

844
01:01:51,865 --> 01:01:54,285
What the hell are you looking at?

845
01:01:55,485 --> 01:01:57,171
Don't point at me buddy.

846
01:01:57,886 --> 01:01:59,825
Lady, move that dog.

847
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,397
Buddy, can you move over a little bit?
Like two feet.

848
01:02:03,716 --> 01:02:06,864
Did somebody call the police?
- Yes, but he'll be dead before they get here.

849
01:02:06,919 --> 01:02:10,591
Somebody needs to talk him down.
- Move out the way!

850
01:02:10,886 --> 01:02:13,335
Help him!

851
01:02:37,481 --> 01:02:38,736
Hey buddy.

852
01:02:38,893 --> 01:02:40,344
Who are you man?

853
01:02:40,838 --> 01:02:44,189
Don't try anything. I'm going to kill myself,
so don't try to stop me.

854
01:02:44,897 --> 01:02:47,916
Okay.
- What do you mean 'Okay'?

855
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:51,499
No. I don't mean, 'Okay'.
Just give me a second.

856
01:02:51,802 --> 01:02:53,653
I should say something here.

857
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:58,981
But I don't really know what it is.
- Man you're terrible. Are you even cop?

858
01:02:59,123 --> 01:03:02,241
Hold on a second, I'm thinking.

859
01:03:03,805 --> 01:03:06,221
Wait, I've got it.

860
01:03:09,215 --> 01:03:10,476
Where you going, man?

861
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:23,846
My man? Hello?
- Don't do it, I'm coming.

862
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,802
Patience is a virtue.

863
01:03:29,803 --> 01:03:31,886
What the hell are you doing in there?

864
01:03:34,931 --> 01:03:39,081
# I wish you would step 
back from that ledge my friend #

865
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:44,430
# You could cut ties with 
all the lies that youve been living in #

866
01:03:45,564 --> 01:03:49,481
# And if you do not want to see me again #

867
01:03:49,496 --> 01:03:53,624
# I would understand #

868
01:03:54,944 --> 01:04:00,781
# I would understand #

869
01:04:03,436 --> 01:04:04,679
What is it?

870
01:04:05,736 --> 01:04:07,940
# The angry boy a bit too insane #

871
01:04:08,019 --> 01:04:10,918
# Icing over a secret pain #

872
01:04:11,116 --> 01:04:16,087
# You know you dont belong #

873
01:04:16,483 --> 01:04:19,537
# Well everyone I know has got a reason #

874
01:04:20,995 --> 01:04:23,948
# To say put the past away #

875
01:04:24,015 --> 01:04:27,287
# I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend #

876
01:04:27,384 --> 01:04:32,094
# You could cut ties with 
all the lies that youve been living in #

877
01:04:32,191 --> 01:04:36,635
# And if you never want to see me again #

878
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:40,792
# I would understand #

879
01:04:40,985 --> 01:04:45,104
# I would understand #

880
01:04:45,399 --> 01:04:49,523
# I would understand #

881
01:04:49,924 --> 01:04:53,524
# I would understand #

882
01:04:54,025 --> 01:04:56,925
# I would underst... #

883
01:05:06,825 --> 01:05:09,533
I've got blisters on my fingers.

884
01:05:15,842 --> 01:05:16,958
Carl.

885
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:21,597
Stephanie. Ted.
Hey. How's it going?

886
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:24,429
What are you guys doing here?
- We're doing a week in Tahiti.

887
01:05:24,539 --> 01:05:26,747
Ted's father owns a little piece of property.

888
01:05:26,883 --> 01:05:29,157
A hundred acres isn't so little, hon.

889
01:05:29,167 --> 01:05:30,264
Not in Tahiti, anyway.

890
01:05:31,124 --> 01:05:35,468
I saw you on TV. That was amazing, Carl.

891
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:38,144
It was just a little life that needed saving.
No big deal.

892
01:05:38,908 --> 01:05:40,276
So, where are you headed?

893
01:05:40,406 --> 01:05:42,446
Meeting my girlfriend here.
We don't know where we're going.

894
01:05:42,604 --> 01:05:44,782
Really?
- Yeah, we're just going to pick a place.

895
01:05:44,869 --> 01:05:46,414
Kind of an 'eeny, meeny, miny' thing

896
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:47,892
Keeps it fresh.

897
01:05:48,063 --> 01:05:49,124
I'll see you guys.

898
01:05:51,290 --> 01:05:53,947
That sounds like a lot of fun.
- Can you imagine? 

899
01:05:54,042 --> 01:05:54,756
No.

900
01:06:07,273 --> 01:06:08,553
I have some carry on, here

901
01:06:08,674 --> 01:06:13,401
I'd like two tickets 
on the first plane out of here, please.

902
01:06:13,558 --> 01:06:14,738
We have never done this before.

903
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:20,670
The next flight available for boarding is to...

904
01:06:22,005 --> 01:06:23,133
Lincoln, Nebraska.

905
01:06:25,139 --> 01:06:30,301
Okay. Okay? - Okay.
Yeah, Lincoln. Here we come.

906
01:06:33,981 --> 01:06:38,434
Where does someone go in Lincoln Neb?
- Well, clearly we should go there.

907
01:06:40,264 --> 01:06:44,460
Telephone Museum

908
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:48,216
The earliest switchboard operators' 
headsets weighed over 10 1/2 pounds.

909
01:06:49,538 --> 01:06:51,270
Interesting.
- Look at this.

910
01:06:53,819 --> 01:06:55,655
The first phone call ever.
- Pretty cool.

911
01:06:56,187 --> 01:06:57,711
Check out the phone.

912
01:06:57,968 --> 01:06:58,963
Smaller than I thought it would be.

913
01:06:59,846 --> 01:07:01,049
Hold on. I'm vibrating.

914
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:02,138
Hello?

915
01:07:07,069 --> 01:07:08,239
Nice shot.

916
01:07:10,753 --> 01:07:13,454
What do you know about that?
- Pretty sexy.

917
01:07:15,238 --> 01:07:16,834
So, what do we do just....

918
01:07:24,451 --> 01:07:25,813
Pull.

919
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:29,559
I got it! I got it!

920
01:07:29,867 --> 01:07:32,148
Can I do it again?
What's wrong?

921
01:07:52,223 --> 01:07:53,763
Twenty bucks OK kills 'em

922
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:56,362
Hey, Pete. Mind putting that on a coaster?

923
01:07:56,563 --> 01:07:57,695
What, do you live here now?

924
01:07:57,832 --> 01:08:01,550
Yeah, I asked Carl and he had to say 'yes'.

925
01:08:03,411 --> 01:08:07,917
Hey, is that Carl?
- Wait a second.

926
01:08:14,053 --> 01:08:16,000
He's there in Nebraska.
- Wow!

927
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:19,815
This is the interesting part,

928
01:08:20,052 --> 01:08:23,599
because if you don't take the heads off properly,
then everything gets mixed into the batch

929
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:27,183
Someone gets a beak in their bucket 
or a mouthfull of tendons.

930
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:28,646
and you've got a lawsuit on your hands.

931
01:08:30,752 --> 01:08:33,312
We got a fainter down in head removal.

932
01:08:38,474 --> 01:08:40,274
I can't believe I tripped like that.

933
01:08:41,615 --> 01:08:45,024
Huh, it seemed like you fainted.
- No, I told you my foot caught a nail.

934
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,184
Oh, okay.

935
01:08:47,618 --> 01:08:50,749
I thought it was all the chicken beaks in the bucket.
- Don't. Please.

936
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:54,306
Oh God, it starting to rain.

937
01:08:57,605 --> 01:08:59,486
I'll protect you. Come on.

938
01:09:00,712 --> 01:09:01,728
Hurry. There's no time to lose.

939
01:09:02,175 --> 01:09:03,633
We have to find shelter.

940
01:09:03,965 --> 01:09:05,038
Come on.

941
01:09:07,412 --> 01:09:09,454
Get in here. 
It's okay. I got you..

942
01:09:11,917 --> 01:09:13,540
Are you okay?

943
01:09:13,812 --> 01:09:15,140
Are you hurt?

944
01:09:23,253 --> 01:09:24,330
What?

945
01:09:26,093 --> 01:09:27,646
I do not know.
I think I love you.

946
01:09:29,179 --> 01:09:30,442
Really?

947
01:09:31,113 --> 01:09:33,439
I known that I like you for a while,

948
01:09:33,451 --> 01:09:35,296
but now I have decided
that I love you.

949
01:09:35,650 --> 01:09:38,450
Do you love me?
- Definitely.

950
01:09:39,134 --> 01:09:40,131
I love you like

951
01:09:40,894 --> 01:09:42,550
I can't believe it.

952
01:09:42,645 --> 01:09:44,452
It's kind of ridiculous.

953
01:09:45,739 --> 01:09:49,036
I've been thinking and I know
it's crazy, especially for me,

954
01:09:49,761 --> 01:09:53,296
but maybe when we get back
we should move in together.

955
01:09:55,427 --> 01:09:57,623
Wow? Really, you think of that?

956
01:09:59,253 --> 01:10:01,803
What do you think?
- What do I think?

957
01:10:03,402 --> 01:10:04,861
Yeah.
- Oh God, you paused.

958
01:10:05,023 --> 01:10:06,564
No, I didn't pause.
- You paused.

959
01:10:06,595 --> 01:10:10,286
No no no I didn't pause. It's just a big step.
- It was a stupid idea. I shouldn't have said anything

960
01:10:10,638 --> 01:10:13,125
It is too soon.
- No, no, stop. Come on, what are you talking about?

961
01:10:13,455 --> 01:10:14,860
Here, ask me again.

962
01:10:15,356 --> 01:10:16,694
Do you wan...
- Yes!

963
01:10:17,647 --> 01:10:20,226
Did I pause there? I could probably
knock a couple milliseconds off that.

964
01:10:35,843 --> 01:10:39,041
Where are you traveling today?
- Los Angeles.

965
01:10:42,102 --> 01:10:43,558
I'll just be one minute.

966
01:10:45,305 --> 01:10:48,271
We should do this every weekend.
We could see the whole world.

967
01:10:48,498 --> 01:10:49,570
I'm in.

968
01:10:50,495 --> 01:10:52,724
Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

969
01:10:56,108 --> 01:10:59,930
Sir, you mind coming with us please?

970
01:11:00,309 --> 01:11:01,418
I'm sorry?

971
01:11:01,844 --> 01:11:03,547
We just want to ask you a few questions.

972
01:11:06,294 --> 01:11:09,588
You are hilarious.
Aww, that's great.

973
01:11:11,593 --> 01:11:12,705
Are you in on this too?

974
01:11:13,258 --> 01:11:16,153
You guys really had me going there.
There is a crazy man in the terminal.

975
01:11:16,594 --> 01:11:17,601
Red alert!

976
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:21,087
Good job.
- Let's go funny guy.

977
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:26,475
Do you hate your country, Mr. Allen?

978
01:11:26,878 --> 01:11:30,495
What?
- Do you hate America?

979
01:11:30,548 --> 01:11:33,490
No, of course not.
- Why are you plotting to attack it?

980
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:38,008
What? - I think you have the wrong guy.
- I'm sorry, was I speaking to you?

981
01:11:38,053 --> 01:11:41,460
We've been tracking you Mr Allen. We know
who you are. We know what you are planning.

982
01:11:41,585 --> 01:11:43,737
This is insane.
Do you think I'm a terrorist?

983
01:11:43,844 --> 01:11:45,736
Why did you purchase 
these plane tickets at the last minute?

984
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,730
It was a spontaneous vacation.

985
01:11:48,853 --> 01:11:54,198
Oh right. I was just saying to Agent Tweed how 
I wanted to take a fun-filled acation in Lincoln, Neb.

986
01:11:54,426 --> 01:11:57,602
Are you currently a member of
Persianwifefinder.com?

987
01:11:58,367 --> 01:12:00,963
Yes, but you don't underst...
- Yes? What is that?

988
01:12:01,566 --> 01:12:04,130
Faranoosh. It was nothing.
I can explain.... I can explain.

989
01:12:04,426 --> 01:12:05,174
Explain this jackhole.

990
01:12:05,475 --> 01:12:10,775
As chief loan officer at BREA F.S.L. you
gave a man money to start a fertilizer business.

991
01:12:10,902 --> 01:12:12,487
For what? Bombs?
- No.

992
01:12:12,572 --> 01:12:16,234
Have you recently started taking flying lessons?
- Yes. Oh come on!

993
01:12:16,447 --> 01:12:18,747
Why did you learn Korean?
Are you allying with the North Koreans?

994
01:12:18,788 --> 01:12:19,778
No! What?

995
01:12:19,796 --> 01:12:22,538
You were married for only six months.
Was that some sort of immigration thing?

996
01:12:22,609 --> 01:12:26,527
Were you married?
- Yes, oh, that was a long time ago.

997
01:12:26,618 --> 01:12:27,885
I was going to tell you.

998
01:12:27,949 --> 01:12:31,465
I was going to tell her, I just didn't ...
- Start talking, Carl.

999
01:12:31,965 --> 01:12:33,153
If that is your real name.

1000
01:12:34,414 --> 01:12:37,709
We knew another Karl we weren't 
too crazy about, didn't we, Tweed?

1001
01:12:39,445 --> 01:12:40,545
His name was Marx.

1002
01:12:44,990 --> 01:12:46,160
I need to speak to my attorney.

1003
01:12:51,425 --> 01:12:54,570
Several months ago, my client 
attended a self-empowerment seminar

1004
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:58,839
that requires him to say 'Yes' 
to any request that's presented

1005
01:12:59,388 --> 01:13:02,047
So all the activity that appears 
suspicious, the flying lessons, ...

1006
01:13:02,059 --> 01:13:04,211
the spontaneous trip taking

1007
01:13:04,896 --> 01:13:07,573
it's all because he must 
say 'Yes' to any opportunity.

1008
01:13:08,599 --> 01:13:09,573
He is really in to it.

1009
01:13:09,587 --> 01:13:12,393
You just say 'Yes' everything? Are you kidding me?
- It's not what it sounds like.

1010
01:13:12,408 --> 01:13:13,974
Oh really? How does it sound, 
because I'd really love to hear it.

1011
01:13:14,004 --> 01:13:17,060
I'm wondering if there's a 
better setting for this back and forth?

1012
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:19,041
Yeah, maybe we should 
speak privately. Come on inside.

1013
01:13:23,242 --> 01:13:24,942
Whew, pretty close.

1014
01:13:25,191 --> 01:13:27,844
What the hell, Carl?
Are you serious, you just say 'Yes' to everything?

1015
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:30,766
Even if you don't like it?
- No, of course not.

1016
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:33,695
Sometimes.
- Oh, good. What a relief

1017
01:13:33,701 --> 01:13:37,283
because I thought you lied all the time.
but it's just sometimes, that's really excellent.

1018
01:13:37,762 --> 01:13:40,967
So you didn't want to come to my show?
You didn't want to go jogging with me?

1019
01:13:41,244 --> 01:13:44,325
You didn't want to travel with me?
- Yes I did! That was my idea!

1020
01:13:44,821 --> 01:13:46,593
And when I asked if you wanted to move in together, 

1021
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,930
that took a lot for me to do that and I meant it.

1022
01:13:49,646 --> 01:13:53,699
and I didn't know what to expect, but I guess I 
figured like an adult you were going to weigh the options.

1023
01:13:54,581 --> 01:13:58,316
You paused. You wanted to say no,
but you couldn't because you had to say 'Yes'.

1024
01:13:58,529 --> 01:14:00,877
That's not ...entirely  ...true.

1025
01:14:00,971 --> 01:14:05,511
How do I know if anything you did was because 
you wanted to or because of some goddamn program?

1026
01:14:13,838 --> 01:14:14,785
Allison.

1027
01:14:16,478 --> 01:14:17,635
Bye, Carl.

1028
01:14:31,958 --> 01:14:34,847
I can't believe I didn't tell her 
I was married. I'm such an idiot.

1029
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,236
You know what I did?
- What's that.

1030
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:39,349
She asked me to move in with her 
and I hesitated.

1031
01:14:39,626 --> 01:14:42,229
That was like a 'no'. I should have 
just said 'Yes' right away, you know?

1032
01:14:43,104 --> 01:14:44,207
That's how the whole thing got screwed up.

1033
01:14:44,503 --> 01:14:46,003
I broke the covenant.

1034
01:14:46,004 --> 01:14:47,972
No, you ever think things got 
screwed up because you said 'Yes' 

1035
01:14:47,993 --> 01:14:49,753
to every single thing without thinking?

1036
01:14:49,947 --> 01:14:51,488
Not because of a covenant you made with yourself.
- Well, this 

1037
01:14:51,496 --> 01:14:53,323
...covenant with the universe is kind of a big deal man

1038
01:14:53,721 --> 01:14:56,931
There is a new ground rule, Carl. 
You can process things. You can weigh them individually

1039
01:14:56,940 --> 01:15:01,044
and make decisions on a case by case basis,
 aka what normal people do.

1040
01:15:01,089 --> 01:15:03,251
Yeah, that's a good point. Hold that thought.
Allison!

1041
01:15:04,064 --> 01:15:04,992
Or not.

1042
01:15:05,222 --> 01:15:08,169
Allison! Please, can we talk for a second?
- Get away from me.  -- Okay

1043
01:15:09,358 --> 01:15:10,252
Farther.
- Yep.

1044
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:13,716
Carl?

1045
01:15:17,796 --> 01:15:18,742
Goodbye, Carl.

1046
01:15:19,978 --> 01:15:23,244
 I just love good food.
- So do I.

1047
01:15:23,473 --> 01:15:26,160
Do you?
You know you and I are a lot alike?

1048
01:15:35,539 --> 01:15:38,672
Hey, it's me again

1049
01:15:39,328 --> 01:15:41,798
Specifically I'm talking about 15 to 20 percent....

1050
01:15:59,632 --> 01:16:02,482
Okay, I'm totally off the controls.

1051
01:16:03,927 --> 01:16:05,643
You're officially flying by yourself.

1052
01:16:07,344 --> 01:16:08,244
Cool

1053
01:16:09,316 --> 01:16:11,128
There's no greater feeling in the world, is there?

1054
01:16:15,239 --> 01:16:20,967
Hello Jake, Rodrigo, Penelope,
Phillip, Zachary.

1055
01:16:21,168 --> 01:16:25,007
I'd like to thank you all for coming for 
no other reason than you genuinely wanted to.

1056
01:16:25,934 --> 01:16:29,042
In an unrelated note, everyone
else can go jump off a bridge.

1057
01:16:59,524 --> 01:17:00,598
Allison?

1058
01:17:00,939 --> 01:17:04,580
No, it's Wes P., Big C. 
Did I catch you at a bad time?

1059
01:17:05,182 --> 01:17:07,389
No, I'm just hanging here.

1060
01:17:08,776 --> 01:17:11,350
Okay, I'm just checking in, 
seeing how corporate's treating you. 

1061
01:17:11,351 --> 01:17:14,051
It kicks the crap out of dealing with those peons, eh?

1062
01:17:14,246 --> 01:17:17,231
Well I never really thought of it ...
- Hang on just a second. 

1063
01:17:20,441 --> 01:17:21,268
Wes?

1064
01:17:22,392 --> 01:17:24,373
Can you hear me?
- Go get the ball!

1065
01:17:24,747 --> 01:17:27,370
So listen . I've got a job for you.

1066
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:29,358
We're shutting down a bunch of branches 
and I need you to tell the managers.

1067
01:17:29,694 --> 01:17:31,786
Shutting down branches?
- Uh huh.

1068
01:17:32,087 --> 01:17:33,187
Which ones?

1069
01:17:35,644 --> 01:17:37,558
We are Sparta!

1070
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:42,576
Hi, Norm.

1071
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:06,665
You have three messages

1072
01:18:07,839 --> 01:18:09,610
Hi Car, this is your answer phone speaking

1073
01:18:10,529 --> 01:18:13,721
Nah, it's me, Norm, just a reminder 
about the party tonight. See you there buddy.

1074
01:18:16,633 --> 01:18:19,222
Carl, it's Rooney. Thanks for letting me use your car. 

1075
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:21,283
You might notice the front bumper is missing

1076
01:18:21,306 --> 01:18:24,348
Not to worry. I gave them your insurance.
The whole thing is being handled.

1077
01:18:24,748 --> 01:18:27,462
Oh, and I left a pile of laundry 
in my room. Don't forget, no starch.

1078
01:18:27,557 --> 01:18:28,328
Love you.

1079
01:18:29,562 --> 01:18:32,696
It's Peter. I'm sure you are aware,
and completely on top of it

1080
01:18:32,763 --> 01:18:36,066
but I just wanted to make sure that Lucy's
bridal shower is still on for tomorrow night.

1081
01:18:36,308 --> 01:18:38,718
I haven't received a confirmation 
of any sort from you.

1082
01:18:38,823 --> 01:18:40,430
 At all.
- Shower!

1083
01:18:40,478 --> 01:18:43,581
Shit!
- Allright? Call me. 

1084
01:18:55,665 --> 01:18:57,817
Hey guys.
- What's wrong?

1085
01:18:57,911 --> 01:18:59,342
I just really need to talk to you.

1086
01:19:01,217 --> 01:19:03,200
Come on inside,
I'll explain everything.

1087
01:19:08,877 --> 01:19:11,657
'Surprise!'

1088
01:19:12,133 --> 01:19:13,822
Oh my God!.
- Happy shower!

1089
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:16,612
How did you pull this off?
- I just called in a few favors,

1090
01:19:16,707 --> 01:19:18,072
kept throwing money at it.

1091
01:19:18,968 --> 01:19:20,173
I like it. I like it.

1092
01:19:21,074 --> 01:19:22,074
Rooney!

1093
01:19:22,748 --> 01:19:26,791
That's Bert. He's in fertilizer.
And Lee. He's a male nurse.

1094
01:19:27,712 --> 01:19:30,421
Hey, let's get this guy a drink.
He doesn't have long to live.

1095
01:19:35,568 --> 01:19:37,360
Cake?
- Thanks.

1096
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:42,099
Oh, John Goodman.
- No, it's Alec Baldwin.

1097
01:19:43,698 --> 01:19:46,237
Oh, right. Nailed it.

1098
01:19:52,687 --> 01:19:55,859
Norm?
Hey, thanks for coming, man.

1099
01:19:56,553 --> 01:19:57,957
How are you holding up?

1100
01:19:58,302 --> 01:19:59,777
I'm okay Car.

1101
01:20:00,249 --> 01:20:02,130
Taking it day by day.

1102
01:20:03,341 --> 01:20:05,518
Welll I got a friend I want you to meet.

1103
01:20:06,518 --> 01:20:13,903
Soo-Mi, this is Norman.
Norman, this is Soo-Mi

1104
01:20:14,204 --> 01:20:15,304
Hi there.

1105
01:20:16,606 --> 01:20:18,080
Can I call you Soo?

1106
01:20:19,601 --> 01:20:20,488
Yes

1107
01:20:21,312 --> 01:20:22,742
Do you dance?

1108
01:20:22,634 --> 01:20:25,010
Well, I've won some competitions.
Watch this.

1109
01:20:25,525 --> 01:20:26,702
Come on.

1110
01:20:53,925 --> 01:20:57,976
That's an interesting one.
- Yep, and it's half price.

1111
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:09,083
This is the best wedding shower ever, man.
- You deserve it.

1112
01:21:09,290 --> 01:21:11,172
You allright?
- Yes

1113
01:21:11,815 --> 01:21:14,000
Still not calling you back?
- No.

1114
01:21:14,350 --> 01:21:16,019
What are you going to do?

1115
01:21:16,351 --> 01:21:20,117
I don't know. I guess I'll just stick with the 
program. Keep saying 'Yes' to everything. 

1116
01:21:21,148 --> 01:21:24,498
I know it sounds silly, but maybe 
all that bad stuff leads to something good.

1117
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:26,686
That doesn't sound silly.

1118
01:21:27,329 --> 01:21:29,242
Well, maybe a little silly.

1119
01:21:30,107 --> 01:21:32,795
You wanna get dinner tomorrow night?
- Yes

1120
01:21:32,959 --> 01:21:34,231
Not because I have to.

1121
01:21:34,619 --> 01:21:36,442
Well, you do have to.
- Yeah.

1122
01:21:37,865 --> 01:21:40,115
But you want to?
- Oh yeah.

1123
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:42,757
So badly.
- Oh God, me too.

1124
01:21:43,437 --> 01:21:45,255
It's all I can think about.
- Really?

1125
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:51,610
Hi there.

1126
01:21:52,956 --> 01:21:54,027
Hello there.

1127
01:21:55,757 --> 01:21:58,247
You must be Tillie.

1128
01:21:59,932 --> 01:22:04,023
I've certainly heard a lot about you.
- Isn't that nice?.

1129
01:22:07,368 --> 01:22:12,665
Would you mind helping me?
- Absolutely. No problem.

1130
01:22:14,937 --> 01:22:16,084
Come on, let's go.

1131
01:22:25,862 --> 01:22:28,510
Hello
- Hi, Carl.

1132
01:22:29,331 --> 01:22:32,850
Oh, Stephanie. What's wrong?

1133
01:22:33,003 --> 01:22:34,683
Can you come over?

1134
01:22:35,027 --> 01:22:37,847
We had this big fight and he stormed off.

1135
01:22:38,116 --> 01:22:41,686
These things have a way of 
working themselves out.

1136
01:22:41,916 --> 01:22:46,737
I don't know. Not this time.
I think it's over.

1137
01:22:49,462 --> 01:22:51,866
Maybe it's supposed to be?

1138
01:22:52,196 --> 01:22:53,257
You know?

1139
01:22:53,622 --> 01:22:56,594
Part of me felt like something 
wasn't right from the beginning.

1140
01:22:57,448 --> 01:23:00,139
I don't know, Carl. I'm so confused.

1141
01:23:02,594 --> 01:23:06,282
I'm kind of confused at this point as well.

1142
01:23:06,859 --> 01:23:09,420
Stay with me tonight.
- Oh, Steph ...

1143
01:23:14,442 --> 01:23:17,990
Steph, I can't.

1144
01:23:19,028 --> 01:23:20,452
I'm sorry.

1145
01:23:23,065 --> 01:23:25,022
What are you saying?

1146
01:23:26,482 --> 01:23:28,632
I'm saying no.

1147
01:23:44,591 --> 01:23:46,156
Are you serious?

1148
01:23:59,372 --> 01:24:00,943
Oh Jesus!

1149
01:24:08,138 --> 01:24:09,778
Oh please.

1150
01:24:10,688 --> 01:24:12,125
I didn't even see the red zone.

1151
01:24:12,223 --> 01:24:15,653
I've only been here for twenty minutes.
- Sorry pal, can't help you.

1152
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:18,129
Oh come on, can't you give me a break?

1153
01:24:19,125 --> 01:24:22,625
'No man' 'No man' 'No man' 

1154
01:24:23,939 --> 01:24:26,109
Not possible!

1155
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:30,252
Jackoff.

1156
01:24:45,633 --> 01:24:47,291
Terrence don't freak out.

1157
01:25:10,853 --> 01:25:13,442
Geeze, could that nurse be any more obvious?

1158
01:25:15,047 --> 01:25:18,552
She keeps coming in the room, 
it's like 'Give me some space, woman.'

1159
01:25:18,773 --> 01:25:21,788
Again, I'm pretty sure 
she was just here checking on Carl.

1160
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:26,832
The covenant.

1161
01:25:26,965 --> 01:25:28,494
Hey, buddy, you alright?

1162
01:25:29,527 --> 01:25:32,786
The covenant.
It's coming down hard on me, man.

1163
01:25:33,289 --> 01:25:36,295
Gotta do something about this covenant nonsense
- It's not nonsense.

1164
01:25:36,390 --> 01:25:37,959
It is nonsense.

1165
01:25:39,254 --> 01:25:40,325
It's him.

1166
01:25:42,077 --> 01:25:45,636
Oh my God, Terrence.
You have to remove the covenant.

1167
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:49,332
It's killing me.
- First, what were you doing in my car?

1168
01:25:49,469 --> 01:25:51,171
I told you. I need you to remove the covenant.

1169
01:25:51,372 --> 01:25:52,872
There is no covenant.

1170
01:25:52,895 --> 01:25:56,045
There never was.
It was just riffing.

1171
01:25:56,609 --> 01:25:57,476
Riffing?

1172
01:25:57,552 --> 01:25:59,614
Well, I had to say something.
You were being difficult.

1173
01:25:59,815 --> 01:26:01,315
Embarrassing me in front of my crowd.

1174
01:26:01,522 --> 01:26:04,145
So the whole thing 'Yes' thing is all bullshit?

1175
01:26:04,328 --> 01:26:07,548
No, you just don't know how to use it.
That's all.

1176
01:26:07,642 --> 01:26:10,549
Yeah I did. Say yes to everything.
Real tough to grasp.

1177
01:26:10,671 --> 01:26:12,556
No, that's not the point.

1178
01:26:12,773 --> 01:26:17,394
Well maybe at first it is.
That's just to open you up to get you started.

1179
01:26:17,938 --> 01:26:20,552
Then you are saying 'yes'
not because you have to

1180
01:26:20,986 --> 01:26:23,051
not because a covenant told you to

1181
01:26:23,477 --> 01:26:26,553
because you know in your heart
that you want to.

1182
01:26:29,579 --> 01:26:30,868
You're right.

1183
01:26:31,675 --> 01:26:33,403
That imakes perfect sense.

1184
01:26:33,545 --> 01:26:35,568
That's what I told you. I said that.
- You didn't say that.

1185
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:37,115
I did say that
- You didn't say it like that

1186
01:26:37,208 --> 01:26:39,247
Well, I didn't say it with an accent
- Well.

1187
01:26:39,497 --> 01:26:43,499
Thanks, Terrence.
Sorry about the car and your head there.

1188
01:26:44,191 --> 01:26:47,448
What time is it?
- 5:40 in the morning.

1189
01:26:47,895 --> 01:26:49,272
Perfect.

1190
01:26:51,870 --> 01:26:53,359
I said that.

1191
01:26:53,769 --> 01:26:55,063
Whatever.

1192
01:26:57,060 --> 01:27:00,231
I'm going to hop in the bed 
just in case the nurse comes back.

1193
01:27:05,048 --> 01:27:07,028
Sir, you need to get back to your room.
- No I don't.

1194
01:27:07,124 --> 01:27:09,098
Sir, stop right there.
- Eat me.

1195
01:27:11,939 --> 01:27:15,453
Lee, what are you doing here?
- I am a nurse, remember?

1196
01:27:15,553 --> 01:27:17,602
Oh, yeah, right.

1197
01:27:18,223 --> 01:27:20,125
Sorry, I borrow your car?

1198
01:27:20,277 --> 01:27:24,045
Well I don't have my car anymore.
I got my Ducati, thanks to you.

1199
01:27:25,003 --> 01:27:27,083
Ducati.

1200
01:27:31,789 --> 01:27:35,139
Have you ever driven one of these before?
They're quite powerful.

1201
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:38,282
Yeah, I ride double all the time 
on the scooter with Allison.

1202
01:27:38,632 --> 01:27:42,292
No, Carl, this is not the same.
You really have to be careful.

1203
01:27:42,581 --> 01:27:46,547
These things have a lot of ...
- Holy shit...

1204
01:27:47,042 --> 01:27:48,334
...torque.

1205
01:27:59,805 --> 01:28:02,503
How are you doin'?
- Can't complain.

1206
01:28:17,932 --> 01:28:19,619
 Sorry.

1207
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:12,955
What an asshole.

1208
01:29:28,281 --> 01:29:30,128
Carl, what are you doing here?

1209
01:29:30,224 --> 01:29:33,694
I just wanted to tell you
that I don't want to live with you.

1210
01:29:33,938 --> 01:29:37,014
Oh, wow, thanks. My knight in shining armor.

1211
01:29:37,210 --> 01:29:39,585
Okay people, let's go.

1212
01:29:42,889 --> 01:29:44,129
But I want to be with you.

1213
01:29:44,225 --> 01:29:46,459
But I don't want to be with you.
I don't even know who you are.

1214
01:29:46,555 --> 01:29:49,279
Everything I said to you, I meant, except for 
the part about living together.

1215
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:50,280
That makes me nervous.

1216
01:29:50,374 --> 01:29:51,987
But that's normal. It's a big decision. 

1217
01:29:51,988 --> 01:29:54,188
We shouldn't just jump into something 
like that without thinking about it.

1218
01:29:54,276 --> 01:29:58,094
Why not? You do it with everything. You just 
say 'yes, yes, yes' to whatever comes your way.

1219
01:29:58,190 --> 01:30:00,751
That's not true. 
You can say no if you don't want to.

1220
01:30:00,881 --> 01:30:03,552
Oh, brilliant Carl. Where did you get that?
Your literature?

1221
01:30:03,714 --> 01:30:07,140
Look, I know the philosophy has some holes.
- Oh, you think?

1222
01:30:07,869 --> 01:30:11,070
Seems pretty air tight to me.
- But if I hadn't done that

1223
01:30:11,099 --> 01:30:12,371
I never would have met you.

1224
01:30:12,922 --> 01:30:15,374
Because the old Carl didn't think he was enough for anybody.

1225
01:30:15,637 --> 01:30:18,523
I thought if I said 'yes' to things and got involved with people

1226
01:30:18,785 --> 01:30:21,538
sooner or later they'd find out i'm not enough.

1227
01:30:21,670 --> 01:30:23,973
I didn't think I had anything to share.

1228
01:30:24,131 --> 01:30:26,790
But now I know what 
I have to share is pretty huge.

1229
01:30:26,866 --> 01:30:29,777
And I want to share it with you.
- Do you mind, Reggie?

1230
01:30:29,873 --> 01:30:32,720
Seriously, dude.
- Sorry, seemed interesting.

1231
01:30:33,107 --> 01:30:35,663
Even if I had met you, 
I never would have asked you out.

1232
01:30:35,716 --> 01:30:38,976
You were the complete opposite of me.
You did things and had friends,

1233
01:30:39,045 --> 01:30:42,001
and sang in rock bands
and made life happen.

1234
01:30:42,251 --> 01:30:44,409
You weren't scared of anything.

1235
01:30:44,429 --> 01:30:48,310
You don't think I'm scared of anything?
Who do you think I am?

1236
01:30:48,405 --> 01:30:52,216
I'm scared of a lot of things.
- And I'm scared too.

1237
01:30:52,589 --> 01:30:54,711
Let be scared together.

1238
01:30:56,401 --> 01:30:58,570
I don't know what you want me to say?

1239
01:30:58,881 --> 01:31:02,928
So just say yes,
but only if you really want to.

1240
01:31:03,481 --> 01:31:06,989
And can you do it kind of soon?
I'm starting to get a chill.

1241
01:31:07,512 --> 01:31:09,366
Yeah, I noticed that.

1242
01:31:09,708 --> 01:31:10,869
Well?

1243
01:31:17,463 --> 01:31:19,982
Maybe.
- Come on.

1244
01:31:20,465 --> 01:31:24,103
I'm not going to say that word.
- Okay, maybe is fine. Maybe's good.

1245
01:31:30,547 --> 01:31:32,266
I like 'maybe'.

1246
01:31:32,457 --> 01:31:34,412
Reggie, come on.

1247
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:05,736
Excuse me but pleats are kind of out of style.
You got anything with a flat front?

1248
01:32:05,742 --> 01:32:10,704
Aww, Soo-Mi, pleats are out?
- It makes your package look good.

1249
01:32:10,899 --> 01:32:14,222
Thanks, guys. This is the single biggest 
donation that we've ever haaad.

1250
01:32:14,298 --> 01:32:16,550
You're welcome, 
but it was Carl that made it all happen.

1251
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:19,417
You're a good man, Carl.
- No big deal.

1252
01:32:19,897 --> 01:32:21,995
I know a lot of people who are willing to give.

1253
01:32:24,216 --> 01:32:26,062
Say it a million times

1254
01:32:26,845 --> 01:32:28,939
Say it a million more times.

1255
01:32:29,335 --> 01:32:33,167
And the word you will have said two million times is:

1256
01:32:34,014 --> 01:32:35,628
'Yes!'

1257
01:32:41,165 --> 01:32:42,729
Good God.

1258
01:32:44,730 --> 01:32:54,730
subz by Major.TJ.Kong

1259
01:34:14,202 --> 01:34:16,120
So, anything else we need to know?

1260
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:19,700
Your instinct is going to be 
to break with your chin or your forehead.

1261
01:34:20,001 --> 01:34:21,501
Try to resist that.
- That's right - Right

1262
01:34:24,302 --> 01:34:27,402
Oh, and thanks for the loan. I never
could have finished the suits without it.

1263
01:34:30,003 --> 01:34:33,403
Listen, i'm not going to think anything 
less of you if you don't want to do this.

1264
01:34:33,904 --> 01:34:34,704
What?

1265
01:34:34,705 --> 01:34:36,805
I mean I'm still going to be attracted to you 
if you're a little chicken.

1266
01:34:37,606 --> 01:34:40,329
What about one of those chickens 
whose head didn't get cleanly severed 

1267
01:34:40,335 --> 01:34:41,830
and my beak ends up in the bucket?

1268
01:34:42,731 --> 01:34:44,331
I'll see you at the bottom.

1269
01:34:44,632 --> 01:34:45,932
Unless you pass out.

1270
01:34:46,533 --> 01:34:48,633
I told you. My foot caught a nail.

1271
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:37,000
I love this!
