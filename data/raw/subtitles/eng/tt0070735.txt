1
00:02:34,046 --> 00:02:36,126
You gotta go and see Granger.

2
00:02:42,927 --> 00:02:46,567
8720? Yeah? Yeah. Hold it a minute.

3
00:02:46,727 --> 00:02:50,767
Beat it, Mottola. Mr Granger,
Chicago's on the line.

4
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,167
- Yeah.
- This is Combs.

5
00:02:55,326 --> 00:02:59,327
- Why haven't we heard from you?
- We had a few problems with the law.

6
00:02:59,487 --> 00:03:04,167
The Mayor promised to get tough
on the rackets. Shut everybody down.

7
00:03:04,327 --> 00:03:07,727
- It just put us a little behind.
- Been making your pay-outs?

8
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:10,847
Yes. He does this every year.
Nothing to worry about.

9
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:14,926
<i>Finish your count
as soon as you can and get it up here.</i>

10
00:03:15,086 --> 00:03:19,007
The man's gonna be real happy. Looks
like we cleared 10 grand this week.

11
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:20,887
<i>We cleared 22 here.</i>

12
00:03:21,047 --> 00:03:23,247
You got the whole Chicago South Side.

13
00:03:23,407 --> 00:03:25,926
How can the lousy spots I got
compete with that?

14
00:03:26,087 --> 00:03:30,647
They did 14 grand in Evanston,
16.5 in Gary and 20 in Cicero.

15
00:03:30,807 --> 00:03:32,327
You're bringing up the rear.

16
00:03:32,486 --> 00:03:35,167
I just got the count.
I'll put the take on the 4.15.

17
00:03:35,327 --> 00:03:37,247
We'll be waiting.

18
00:03:40,046 --> 00:03:41,567
Mottola.

19
00:03:43,326 --> 00:03:45,887
Take this up to Chicago for the 4.15.

20
00:03:46,886 --> 00:03:50,046
They'll be waiting for it
at the clearing house.

21
00:03:50,207 --> 00:03:52,246
And don't stop for any entertainment.

22
00:03:52,407 --> 00:03:54,327
You can get a cab over at Seventh.

23
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:56,687
Cut it out.

24
00:03:56,847 --> 00:03:59,007
8720.

25
00:04:11,287 --> 00:04:14,447
Hey, you there! Stop that man!

26
00:04:14,606 --> 00:04:18,327
Stop him! He's got my wallet!
Stop that man!

27
00:04:18,487 --> 00:04:20,527
He's got all my money! Stop him!

28
00:04:20,687 --> 00:04:22,527
Stop him!

29
00:04:25,487 --> 00:04:27,567
Goddamn nigger lover!

30
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:31,447
I'll get you some day for this,
sucker-egg!

31
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:35,487
Don't let him get away! He's got my
wallet. Go after him! He's got my money!

32
00:04:35,647 --> 00:04:38,606
- My wallet!
- We got your wallet. We got it.

33
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:42,326
Did he get you with the knife?
Sit tight, you need a doctor.

34
00:04:42,487 --> 00:04:44,287
- I'll call a cop.
- No, no. No cops.

35
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:50,567
- Are you wanted by the law?
- No, it's OK.

36
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:55,206
Are you nuts carrying that
in this neighbourhood?

37
00:04:55,367 --> 00:04:58,847
Thanks. I'm obliged to you
but I gotta get going.

38
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,526
You ain't going nowhere.

39
00:05:01,687 --> 00:05:05,607
I gotta. I run some slots
down in West Bend for a mob here.

40
00:05:05,766 --> 00:05:09,567
I got behind in the pay-offs. They think
I've been holding out on them.

41
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,327
Gave me till four
to come up with the cash.

42
00:05:12,486 --> 00:05:16,446
- If they don't get it, I'm dead.
- It don't look good. It's almost four.

43
00:05:16,606 --> 00:05:20,207
I'll give you and your friend 100 bucks
to deliver it for me.

44
00:05:21,927 --> 00:05:23,527
I don't know.

45
00:05:23,687 --> 00:05:27,367
That mug is mad. What if he's
around the corner with his friends?

46
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,407
He won't know you're carrying it.
You gotta help me.

47
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:35,926
I'm sorry, I'll help you get fixed up,
but I ain't about to walk into no knife.

48
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:40,287
How about you? All you gotta do is put
it in the door slot. I'll give you 100.

49
00:05:40,447 --> 00:05:42,526
Why trust him? He didn't do shit.

50
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:45,526
Butt out, chicken liver.
I gave him back the wallet.

51
00:05:45,686 --> 00:05:47,767
- How far is this place?
- 1811 Mason.

52
00:05:47,927 --> 00:05:50,567
Box 3C. You won't have no trouble.

53
00:05:52,007 --> 00:05:56,646
There's $5,000 there,
and here's 100 bucks for you.

54
00:05:56,806 --> 00:06:01,487
OK, old man, I'll make your drop
for you. Don't worry, you can trust me.

55
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:06,967
Hey... Hey. If those goons search you,
you won't get far carrying it there.

56
00:06:07,127 --> 00:06:09,647
- What'll we do?
- Got a bag or something?

57
00:06:09,806 --> 00:06:11,407
How about a handkerchief?

58
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:13,847
- Here's a handkerchief.
- Give it to me.

59
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:16,806
- Give me the money.
- Just hurry, will you?

60
00:06:18,886 --> 00:06:22,247
Got any more? Better give it all to me
if you wanna keep it.

61
00:06:22,407 --> 00:06:27,047
They think I was holding out on them.
My wife's sick, I had to pay the bills.

62
00:06:27,207 --> 00:06:29,727
Stuff it down your pants,
like that. Got it?

63
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,527
- Yeah.
- Hurry, will you?

64
00:06:31,687 --> 00:06:34,366
No tough guy in the world
is gonna frisk you there.

65
00:06:34,526 --> 00:06:36,087
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

66
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:51,327
- Where to?
- Which way is Mason?

67
00:06:51,487 --> 00:06:52,766
20 blocks south.

68
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,967
OK, go north. Joliet Station. Fast.

69
00:06:55,127 --> 00:06:57,126
Right.

70
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:01,246
What's so funny?

71
00:07:01,406 --> 00:07:04,207
I just made
the world's easiest five grand!

72
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:17,767
- Come on, Luther! Come on!
- I'm fadin'!

73
00:07:17,927 --> 00:07:19,807
Hustle!

74
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:25,167
In here.

75
00:07:27,887 --> 00:07:30,087
Man, was that beautiful!

76
00:07:30,247 --> 00:07:34,687
- I thought he was onto us.
- No, you had him all the way.

77
00:07:34,846 --> 00:07:36,687
All the way!

78
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:40,727
Wh...?

79
00:07:41,726 --> 00:07:45,207
Luther... Good God! We're millionaires.

80
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:47,047
Did you know he was loaded?

81
00:07:47,206 --> 00:07:50,607
Hell, no, I would have settled for
pawning one of them shoes.

82
00:07:52,207 --> 00:07:54,127
Oh, God!

83
00:07:57,447 --> 00:07:58,927
Woo!

84
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:02,807
Let's get outta here.
We'll split it up tonight.

85
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:38,047
Hey-ya, Marth.

86
00:08:49,087 --> 00:08:51,607
- Hi.
- Hi, Hooker, she's on stage.

87
00:08:56,007 --> 00:08:58,167
Getting married or something?

88
00:08:58,327 --> 00:09:01,647
Get used to it, Leonard.
I'm gonna look this good from now on.

89
00:09:01,806 --> 00:09:04,846
- What do you say, Ed?
- Hi, Hooker.

90
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,286
Hey, psst.

91
00:09:19,366 --> 00:09:21,047
I wanna ta...

92
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:30,527
Hiya, Hooker,
you getting married or something?

93
00:09:36,526 --> 00:09:38,327
Christ sake, did you hear that?

94
00:09:38,487 --> 00:09:40,807
Larry drops four beats
right in my routine.

95
00:09:40,967 --> 00:09:44,407
- Am I gonna put up with that?
- Crystal! Leonard, you're on.

96
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:46,607
Wanna get outta here? I got some dough.

97
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:50,127
I can't. I got a 10 o'clock show.
I need the five bucks.

98
00:09:50,287 --> 00:09:53,767
- I'll spend 50 on you.
- Yeah?

99
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,446
Yeah.

100
00:09:55,606 --> 00:09:57,086
OK.

101
00:09:57,246 --> 00:09:59,966
...opens up his pants,
duck sticks his head out.

102
00:10:00,126 --> 00:10:02,846
One lady says to the other,
"Do you see what I see?"

103
00:10:03,006 --> 00:10:05,807
She says, "So what?
Seen one you seen 'em all."

104
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:08,727
She says, "Yes, but
this one's eating my popcorn."

105
00:10:12,207 --> 00:10:15,486
You see that guy Larry,
he can't keep time.

106
00:10:15,647 --> 00:10:18,287
Supposing there's
a Hollywood agent there?

107
00:10:18,447 --> 00:10:20,406
All that training, down the tubes.

108
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:22,886
Hooker! Ain't seen you in months.

109
00:10:23,047 --> 00:10:25,407
Just hard times. Everything's jake now.

110
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:30,647
How about a ten spot on the line? Lot
of action on 28th Street. Pay you 35...

111
00:10:31,806 --> 00:10:33,927
- Three grand on the red.
- $3,000?

112
00:10:34,087 --> 00:10:36,326
- Are you nuts?
- I feel lucky, come on.

113
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:40,046
I can't accept that, it's too big.
There's a house limit.

114
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:41,727
- Take it.
- But Hooker...

115
00:10:41,887 --> 00:10:43,767
Take it.

116
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:54,207
Twenty-two black.

117
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,807
Tough luck, kid.

118
00:10:57,967 --> 00:10:59,646
Lucky for me it came up black.

119
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:02,367
Fella could get in trouble
losing a bet like that.

120
00:11:02,526 --> 00:11:04,927
Listen, Jimmy,
can't we do it again, huh?

121
00:11:14,726 --> 00:11:17,807
Don't worry about it.
There's more where that came from.

122
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:21,127
"Don't worry about it," he says.
"Don't worry." $3,000!

123
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:24,206
- Thanks.
- $50 he's gonna spend on me!

124
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:27,967
Three thousand dollars!

125
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,366
- Thanks for the evening.
- It's not over.

126
00:11:30,527 --> 00:11:33,646
Next time you wanna
spend 50 bucks on me, mail it.

127
00:11:33,806 --> 00:11:35,767
Listen, will you?

128
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:31,327
Mottola was drunk in a dive in Joliet.
He never got on the train.

129
00:12:31,487 --> 00:12:34,207
I don't care about his day.
What about the money?

130
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:36,766
He lost it to a couple of con artists.

131
00:12:36,927 --> 00:12:40,127
- How much?
- Eleven thousand.

132
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:46,327
OK. I'd better get on the phone
to New York.

133
00:12:46,486 --> 00:12:49,967
See what the big mick
wants to do about it.

134
00:12:50,127 --> 00:12:52,727
Got a pretty good idea, though.

135
00:13:06,007 --> 00:13:07,807
No more bets.

136
00:13:14,766 --> 00:13:17,527
Ace, bet the ace. Bet the ace.

137
00:13:17,687 --> 00:13:20,207
Bet the deuce. Two...

138
00:13:22,607 --> 00:13:25,446
... four, five.

139
00:13:25,607 --> 00:13:29,607
Two straights, ace six, ace deuce...

140
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,967
Ten... Ace six...

141
00:13:33,727 --> 00:13:35,287
And stay.

142
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:38,326
- Doyle, can I talk to you?
- I'm busy, Floyd.

143
00:13:38,486 --> 00:13:42,007
It's important. We had a little trouble
in Chicago, today.

144
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:45,367
One of our runners
got hit for 11 grand.

145
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:48,007
What makes you think
he just didn't pocket it?

146
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:52,647
No, we checked his story with a tipster.
He was cleaned by two grifters.

147
00:13:52,807 --> 00:13:55,886
- They working for anybody?
- I don't know. Could be.

148
00:13:56,046 --> 00:13:58,287
We're running that down now.

149
00:13:58,447 --> 00:14:01,806
Have some local people
take care of him. Nothing fancy.

150
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:04,966
We've got to discourage
this kind of thing.

151
00:14:06,407 --> 00:14:08,366
You follow?

152
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:16,886
<i>...presents Gang Busters...</i>

153
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:27,007
<i>...At war, marching against
the underworld, from coast to coast...</i>

154
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,847
Johnny Hooker! If you ain't a sharper
in them linens!

155
00:14:31,006 --> 00:14:32,526
- Evenin', Louise.
- Hey, Ma.

156
00:14:32,687 --> 00:14:36,447
If I didn't know you better,
I'd swear you had some class.

157
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:40,447
Johnny! Luther said
you were somethin' to see today.

158
00:14:40,606 --> 00:14:43,327
Alva, I gotta get faster
tying up that bundle.

159
00:14:43,486 --> 00:14:46,246
- I give them too much time to think.
- Oh, boushwah.

160
00:14:46,407 --> 00:14:49,567
I used to make that switch
with slower hands than you got.

161
00:14:49,727 --> 00:14:52,406
Up and down Broadway was my best game.

162
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:56,407
Me and Luther didn't make much on it
but it wasn't so touchy.

163
00:14:56,567 --> 00:15:00,127
Them marks can beat you up awful bad
when they catch you.

164
00:15:00,287 --> 00:15:02,087
Come on, we're late for church.

165
00:15:02,247 --> 00:15:04,606
Ma! They're closing in
on Machine Gun Kelly.

166
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:07,366
- Who are you rootin' for, anyhow?
- Hey, Hooker.

167
00:15:07,527 --> 00:15:10,086
- Can't help you, Leroy.
- Nuts.

168
00:15:10,246 --> 00:15:13,447
- Why do you go to church at night?
- They started late bingo.

169
00:15:13,607 --> 00:15:16,647
I'm gonna ask the Lord for some cash
while he's payin' off.

170
00:15:16,807 --> 00:15:19,647
Luther! Look in on the baby
from time to time.

171
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,487
- You too, Louise?
- Gotta go pray, see you.

172
00:15:22,647 --> 00:15:25,527
Yeah. Hey, Erie.

173
00:15:25,687 --> 00:15:29,487
- Gimme, gimme, gimme.
- There's your cut.

174
00:15:29,647 --> 00:15:32,287
Guy turned out to be an oil well.
Which way'd he go?

175
00:15:32,446 --> 00:15:34,327
Due north. He was gonna take it all.

176
00:15:34,487 --> 00:15:36,807
Bastard.
He can blow his nose all the way.

177
00:15:41,727 --> 00:15:44,926
There you go, Luther. Six Gs.

178
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,967
- You're late. Where you been?
- A couple of appointments.

179
00:15:51,926 --> 00:15:54,327
How much did you lose?

180
00:15:59,606 --> 00:16:02,447
- All of it.
- In one goddamn night?

181
00:16:02,607 --> 00:16:05,407
Spraying money around!
You could've been nailed.

182
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:07,607
There weren't no dicks in there.

183
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:10,247
But you're a con man.
And you blew it like a pimp.

184
00:16:10,407 --> 00:16:14,566
- Didn't teach you to be no pimp.
- What's up? I blew money before.

185
00:16:14,727 --> 00:16:17,927
- No class grifter would've done it.
- Think my play is bad?

186
00:16:19,287 --> 00:16:22,407
I think you're the best.

187
00:16:24,687 --> 00:16:27,247
I wouldn't be getting out otherwise.

188
00:16:28,686 --> 00:16:30,527
What are you talking about?

189
00:16:30,687 --> 00:16:34,886
I'm too old for this racket. Hang on
too long, you embarrass yourself.

190
00:16:35,047 --> 00:16:37,447
We just took the biggest score
we ever had.

191
00:16:37,606 --> 00:16:40,127
It's nothing compared to the big con.

192
00:16:40,287 --> 00:16:46,167
You played the big con. You said it was
a dumb game for mama's boys and flakes.

193
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:51,046
Hell, I never played no big con.

194
00:16:51,206 --> 00:16:54,047
I hung around
and picked up a few things.

195
00:16:54,967 --> 00:16:59,127
Ain't no rich boy's gonna trust
a hungry nigger enough to be conned.

196
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:03,727
But I tell you, I been lookin'
for this one all my life, Johnny.

197
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:06,966
Now I have a chance
to step out when I'm ahead.

198
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:09,927
Come on,
what would you do with yourself?

199
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:13,247
I have a brother down in KC,
runs a freight outlet.

200
00:17:13,406 --> 00:17:15,486
I can go halfsies with him.

201
00:17:15,647 --> 00:17:17,926
It ain't too exciting.

202
00:17:18,086 --> 00:17:20,087
But it's mostly legal.

203
00:17:22,287 --> 00:17:25,486
I got an old friend in Chicago,
name of Henry Gondorff.

204
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:27,767
I want you to look him up.

205
00:17:27,927 --> 00:17:29,886
Ain't a better inside man alive.

206
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:33,247
- He'll teach you all you gotta know.
- To hell with that.

207
00:17:34,526 --> 00:17:37,527
- I wanna work with you, Luther.
- I'm out, Johnny.

208
00:17:44,247 --> 00:17:45,887
Yeah, sure.

209
00:17:46,046 --> 00:17:48,887
If that's the way you want it.

210
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:51,207
That's the way I want it.

211
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:56,807
How do you like that, huh?
After five years.

212
00:17:56,967 --> 00:17:59,926
It was the only thing to do.
He was holding you back.

213
00:18:00,087 --> 00:18:03,727
If it weren't for Luther,
I'd still be hustling pinball.

214
00:18:03,886 --> 00:18:08,367
- I don't need more than what I got.
- You gotta lay off games of chance.

215
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:11,607
- There's a depression on.
- There's always a depression.

216
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:15,207
- You should save a little bit.
- I like grifting.

217
00:18:15,367 --> 00:18:17,326
- Buy some things.
- What?

218
00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:20,206
- Clothes? A car?
- I got clothes. I can't drive.

219
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:22,966
- What else have you got to sell?
- Forget it.

220
00:18:24,967 --> 00:18:27,407
Hey, Hooker! Come here, you...

221
00:18:30,646 --> 00:18:32,767
Hi, Snyder. What's the matter?

222
00:18:32,927 --> 00:18:36,927
Things a little slow at the bunco
department? Somebody lose the dominoes?

223
00:18:37,086 --> 00:18:40,127
You scored blood money today.
You need a friend.

224
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:42,487
Go find yourself a shoplifter to roll.

225
00:18:46,887 --> 00:18:50,526
You got the wrong guy, pal.
I been home with the 'flu all day.

226
00:18:50,687 --> 00:18:53,727
- Stake out my toilet if you want.
- Keep talkin'.

227
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,046
Tell you what you did, smart boy.

228
00:19:09,207 --> 00:19:12,847
You tied in to a loaded mark
on 47th across from Maxie's.

229
00:19:13,006 --> 00:19:17,727
You and Coleman played the switch for
him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.

230
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:22,327
If he hadn't been a numbers runner
for Doyle Lonnegan, it'd be perfect.

231
00:19:22,486 --> 00:19:24,806
You're crazy.

232
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:28,926
I ain't stupid enough
to play for no rackets money.

233
00:19:29,087 --> 00:19:33,407
Not intentionally, maybe.
That don't cut no ice with Lonnegan.

234
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:36,407
- He'll swat you like a fly.
- Yeah, well...

235
00:19:37,846 --> 00:19:39,527
I'll square it with the fixer.

236
00:19:39,687 --> 00:19:42,887
Nobody can buy you a prayer
if I put the finger on you.

237
00:19:43,046 --> 00:19:47,247
I figure your end of the score
was at least three Gs.

238
00:19:47,407 --> 00:19:51,006
- I want two, no matter what it was.
- My take was only one.

239
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:54,647
You're gonna have to come up
with another grand somewhere.

240
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:06,607
All right.

241
00:20:17,807 --> 00:20:19,966
You're a smart egg, Hooker.

242
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:23,967
No sense gettin' dead over two grand.

243
00:20:31,766 --> 00:20:34,646
Relax, Erie. I'll bill you.

244
00:20:43,686 --> 00:20:46,367
- I thought you blew all your money?
- I did.

245
00:20:47,687 --> 00:20:51,167
Stuff I gave him is counterfeit.
They'll spot it when he spends it.

246
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,407
Are you crazy?
Giving him counterfeit money?

247
00:20:55,886 --> 00:20:58,646
Hey! Wait up! Where are you going?

248
00:21:07,047 --> 00:21:08,607
Why, you...!

249
00:21:18,367 --> 00:21:21,406
What are you gonna do
if Snyder puts the finger on you?

250
00:21:21,567 --> 00:21:24,207
- It's suicide.
- What difference does it make?

251
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:28,126
If Snyder knows, so does everybody.
He never gets anything first.

252
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,487
Hey, listen to me.
Don't go back to your place tonight.

253
00:21:31,647 --> 00:21:34,647
Don't go any place you usually go,
you hear me?

254
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:37,607
Damn! There's no answer at Luther's.

255
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:41,006
Maybe you better get out of town
or somethin', huh?

256
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:44,527
Lady, please!

257
00:21:44,687 --> 00:21:48,487
- Ma'am! Ma'am!
- I want my nickel for the telephone!

258
00:21:54,127 --> 00:21:57,486
No sir, nobody here did.

259
00:21:57,647 --> 00:22:00,327
1521 North Bryant.

260
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:05,566
Luther!

261
00:22:16,327 --> 00:22:20,487
- Is he dead?
- I don't know. It was a big fight.

262
00:22:20,646 --> 00:22:22,887
Somebody must have pushed him.

263
00:22:25,567 --> 00:22:27,767
Oh... Jesus!

264
00:22:27,926 --> 00:22:30,047
- Luther! Luther!
- Jesus...

265
00:22:30,207 --> 00:22:33,006
Oh, God! God!

266
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:35,367
Oh, no, Luther!

267
00:22:35,527 --> 00:22:38,206
Luther! What happened?!

268
00:22:38,366 --> 00:22:41,727
Who would do such a thing to you,
Luther?

269
00:22:41,887 --> 00:22:43,887
Luther!

270
00:22:45,647 --> 00:22:48,007
- Come on.
- Luther...

271
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:52,447
Hooker, come on!
If you stay here, you're dead!

272
00:22:55,086 --> 00:22:57,367
Get outta here!

273
00:22:57,527 --> 00:22:59,687
Help me, help me...

274
00:23:44,527 --> 00:23:46,646
Uh... Excuse me.

275
00:23:46,806 --> 00:23:50,127
I'm looking for a guy named
Henry Gondorff. Do you know him?

276
00:23:50,287 --> 00:23:51,446
No.

277
00:23:56,686 --> 00:23:58,166
Are you sure?

278
00:23:58,326 --> 00:24:00,086
Beat it.

279
00:24:00,246 --> 00:24:03,447
Luther Coleman sent me.

280
00:24:04,727 --> 00:24:07,086
- Are you Hooker?
- Yeah.

281
00:24:08,687 --> 00:24:11,486
Why didn't you say so?

282
00:24:12,527 --> 00:24:14,926
We heard about Luther last night.

283
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:17,207
Come on.

284
00:24:22,887 --> 00:24:25,287
I thought you were a cop or something.

285
00:24:25,447 --> 00:24:30,887
It's the room in the back.
He wasn't expecting you so soon, though.

286
00:24:31,047 --> 00:24:33,527
Thanks.

287
00:25:36,687 --> 00:25:39,487
The great Henry Gondorff.

288
00:25:40,646 --> 00:25:43,047
Turn it off.

289
00:25:45,807 --> 00:25:47,766
Are you sober?

290
00:25:47,927 --> 00:25:50,327
Turn it off, will you?

291
00:26:05,967 --> 00:26:08,567
Glad to meet you, kid.
You're a real horse's ass.

292
00:26:09,647 --> 00:26:13,127
Luther said I could
learn something from you.

293
00:26:13,286 --> 00:26:15,606
I already know how to drink.

294
00:26:16,846 --> 00:26:21,487
Sorry about Luther. He was
the best street worker I ever saw.

295
00:26:24,447 --> 00:26:28,366
He had you down as a big-timer.
What happened?

296
00:26:31,287 --> 00:26:34,527
I conned a senator from Florida
on a stock deal.

297
00:26:34,686 --> 00:26:38,246
A real lop-ear. Thought he was
gonna take over General Electric.

298
00:26:38,407 --> 00:26:42,366
Some chantoozie woke him, though,
and he put the Feds on me.

299
00:26:42,527 --> 00:26:44,727
You mean you blew it?

300
00:26:44,887 --> 00:26:47,127
Luther didn't tell me
you had a big mouth.

301
00:26:47,286 --> 00:26:49,927
He didn't tell me
you was a screw-up either.

302
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,327
You played any big cons since then?

303
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:06,247
I lammed around a bunch of bohunk towns,
one kick ahead of the G-men.

304
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:10,367
Would be still if Billie
hadn't set me up here.

305
00:27:12,847 --> 00:27:15,927
Don't kid yourself, friend.
I still know how.

306
00:27:22,087 --> 00:27:26,207
Gonna stay for breakfast
or do you already know how to eat?

307
00:27:26,367 --> 00:27:29,686
I picked up somethin' on the way.

308
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:35,607
Is Lonnegan after you too?

309
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:38,087
I don't know.
I ain't seen anybody.

310
00:27:38,247 --> 00:27:40,327
You never do, kid.

311
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:55,687
Doyle?

312
00:27:55,847 --> 00:27:57,607
Yeah?

313
00:27:59,967 --> 00:28:04,367
We just talked to Chicago. They got one
of the grifters last night, a nigger.

314
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:09,127
- How about the other one?
- They're still looking for him.

315
00:28:10,447 --> 00:28:13,846
- Who did Combs put on it?
- Riley and Cole.

316
00:28:14,007 --> 00:28:16,927
They staked out the guy's place
but he never showed.

317
00:28:17,087 --> 00:28:19,647
They figure maybe he skipped town.

318
00:28:19,807 --> 00:28:22,447
You wanna keep after him?

319
00:28:22,607 --> 00:28:26,367
See that fellow in the red sweater?
His name's Danny McCoy.

320
00:28:26,527 --> 00:28:30,607
Works protection rackets for Carnello
while waiting for something better.

321
00:28:30,767 --> 00:28:34,447
Danny and I have known each other
since we were six.

322
00:28:36,486 --> 00:28:39,207
Take a good look at that face, Floyd.

323
00:28:39,366 --> 00:28:43,206
Because if he ever finds out
I can be beat by one lousy grifter,

324
00:28:43,367 --> 00:28:45,327
I'll kill him and every other hood

325
00:28:45,487 --> 00:28:48,767
who wants to muscle in
on my Chicago operation.

326
00:28:50,927 --> 00:28:53,247
- You follow?
- Yes, sir.

327
00:28:54,807 --> 00:28:56,447
Good lad.

328
00:28:59,806 --> 00:29:02,607
Feelin' all right
this morning, Henry?

329
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:03,847
Yeah, fine.

330
00:29:04,007 --> 00:29:08,527
Mind opening a little early? We got
some business coming in before hours.

331
00:29:08,687 --> 00:29:11,367
- Sure.
- And check the main gearing, will you?

332
00:29:11,527 --> 00:29:15,446
Man of War started rattling yesterday
and threw a kid on its head.

333
00:29:17,927 --> 00:29:21,527
Great little countess, that Billie.
Runs a spiffy house up there.

334
00:29:21,687 --> 00:29:24,206
You plan to spend
the rest of your life here?

335
00:29:24,366 --> 00:29:26,847
I could do a lot worse.

336
00:29:31,606 --> 00:29:34,167
Am I gonna learn
to play the big con or not?

337
00:29:34,327 --> 00:29:37,167
- What's your hurry?
- I wanna play for Lonnegan.

338
00:29:37,327 --> 00:29:39,726
You know anything about the guy?

339
00:29:39,887 --> 00:29:42,847
Yeah, he croaked Luther.
Anything else I gotta know?

340
00:29:50,087 --> 00:29:51,967
All right...

341
00:29:52,127 --> 00:29:55,886
Runs a numbers racket on the South Side,
owns a packing house, banks...

342
00:29:56,046 --> 00:29:59,087
And half the politicians
in New York and Chicago.

343
00:29:59,247 --> 00:30:01,526
Not a fix in this world
is gonna cool him out.

344
00:30:01,687 --> 00:30:04,167
- I'll get him anyway.
- Why?

345
00:30:04,327 --> 00:30:07,647
Cos I don't know enough
about killing to kill him.

346
00:30:24,207 --> 00:30:28,327
You can't do it alone. Takes a mob of
guys and money to make 'em look good.

347
00:30:28,487 --> 00:30:31,006
- I know guys.
- It ain't like playin' winos...

348
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:32,767
I never played for no winos.

349
00:30:32,926 --> 00:30:35,727
You gotta keep his con.
He can't know you took him.

350
00:30:35,887 --> 00:30:37,487
You're scared of him.

351
00:30:37,647 --> 00:30:40,206
Right down to my socks, buster.

352
00:30:40,367 --> 00:30:44,487
A guy who'd kill a grifter over money
that wouldn't support him for two days.

353
00:30:47,447 --> 00:30:49,246
You're gonna go for him.

354
00:30:51,807 --> 00:30:54,206
I don't want a hot-head
looking to get even,

355
00:30:54,367 --> 00:30:57,407
saying it ain't enough,
cos it's all we're gonna get.

356
00:31:02,647 --> 00:31:04,247
Can you get a mob together?

357
00:31:04,407 --> 00:31:07,727
After what happened to Luther,
I can't get more than 200-300 guys.

358
00:31:12,487 --> 00:31:16,367
Luther said you learn fast.
I hope he's right.

359
00:33:41,567 --> 00:33:43,967
Lonnegan gets most income
from the numbers,

360
00:33:44,126 --> 00:33:46,847
but puts money into
his savings and loans business.

361
00:33:47,006 --> 00:33:49,247
- Moving out of the rackets?
- No.

362
00:33:49,407 --> 00:33:54,006
He owns most of the stock, it's traded.
He's building a respectable image.

363
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:58,327
He came out of Five Points but tells
everybody he was born in Forest Hills.

364
00:33:58,487 --> 00:34:02,847
He knows the market. I don't think
we can take him on a stocks deal.

365
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:06,327
- What about the numbers?
- Run out of a packing house on 14th,

366
00:34:06,486 --> 00:34:08,006
by a guy named Combs.

367
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:11,006
Lonnegan comes every
three weeks or so to check on it,

368
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:14,287
but stays away from the day-to-day stuff
in case it's raided.

369
00:34:14,446 --> 00:34:17,326
Two of Combs's favourite torpedoes,
Riley and Cole.

370
00:34:17,487 --> 00:34:19,167
Ever seen them?

371
00:34:21,647 --> 00:34:23,727
- No.
- They're the ones who hit Luther.

372
00:34:24,927 --> 00:34:28,247
They also got the numbers runner
you conned, named Mottola.

373
00:34:28,407 --> 00:34:31,046
Found him in a quarry
with a knife in his eye.

374
00:34:31,927 --> 00:34:34,407
Lonnegan's had seven
or eight people rubbed.

375
00:34:34,567 --> 00:34:37,167
His pattern's been
to get close to a racket boss,

376
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:39,286
learn the operation and move in on it.

377
00:34:39,447 --> 00:34:42,006
He's done it to Gorman,
O'Donnell, Buchalman,

378
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:43,926
took the numbers from Sharkey.

379
00:34:44,086 --> 00:34:46,126
All four of these guys are dead.

380
00:34:46,286 --> 00:34:48,127
He's vindictive as hell, Henry.

381
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:50,167
Kills for pride.

382
00:34:50,327 --> 00:34:53,247
Doesn't add up he let Hooker
get away from him.

383
00:34:53,406 --> 00:34:55,767
You see anything, kid, you let us know.

384
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,407
If they put you on the spot,
we fold the con.

385
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:00,647
- You got that?
- Yeah.

386
00:35:00,806 --> 00:35:04,007
- Sure it's gonna be one of these two?
- No.

387
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:07,647
They're just the only ones we know of.

388
00:35:09,247 --> 00:35:10,567
OK.

389
00:35:17,006 --> 00:35:18,487
Time.

390
00:35:28,646 --> 00:35:31,207
Set me up five more beers,
will you, Danny?

391
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:42,527
- You the owner here?
- That's right.

392
00:35:42,687 --> 00:35:45,007
Lieutenant Snyder, Bunco.

393
00:35:45,167 --> 00:35:48,647
That's a Joliet badge, Snyder.
Don't cut much up here.

394
00:35:49,567 --> 00:35:52,327
Lookin' for a guy on the lam.
He might be here.

395
00:35:52,487 --> 00:35:56,127
I know everyone here
and I always bounce the lamsters.

396
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,006
All right if I look around?

397
00:35:58,167 --> 00:36:01,607
No, but you're welcome to a free beer
before you go.

398
00:36:08,647 --> 00:36:11,487
I don't really need your permission.

399
00:36:14,886 --> 00:36:16,806
I don't know what to do with this guy.

400
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:20,766
He's an Irishman who doesn't drink,
smoke or chase dames.

401
00:36:20,926 --> 00:36:23,887
Grand Knight of Columbus,
only goes out to play faro.

402
00:36:24,047 --> 00:36:27,047
Plays 15 or 20 hours at a time,
just him against the house.

403
00:36:27,207 --> 00:36:29,447
- Roulette? Crap?
- Won't touch them.

404
00:36:29,607 --> 00:36:32,967
The croupier at Gilman's says
he never plays unless he can win.

405
00:36:33,126 --> 00:36:35,927
- Sports?
- Likes to be seen with fighters

406
00:36:36,087 --> 00:36:38,367
but he doesn't go to fights
or bet on them.

407
00:36:38,527 --> 00:36:41,527
Jesus. Does he do anything
when he's not alone?

408
00:36:41,687 --> 00:36:43,567
Just poker.

409
00:36:44,646 --> 00:36:46,487
And he cheats.

410
00:36:47,407 --> 00:36:49,446
Pretty good at it, too.

411
00:36:55,486 --> 00:36:59,166
- Where does he play?
- Runs a game on the Century Limited

412
00:36:59,326 --> 00:37:01,086
when he comes here from New York.

413
00:37:01,246 --> 00:37:03,607
$100 minimum straight poker.

414
00:37:03,767 --> 00:37:07,247
A lot of high rollers ride that train
just to play him.

415
00:37:07,406 --> 00:37:09,967
That sounds good, JJ.

416
00:37:14,806 --> 00:37:16,567
Which way are the rooms?

417
00:37:16,726 --> 00:37:19,327
- Who told you this guy was in here?
- Nobody.

418
00:37:19,486 --> 00:37:23,687
I know what kind of woman he likes.
I'm gonna check all the joy houses.

419
00:37:23,847 --> 00:37:26,367
Maybe I could help you
if you tell me his name.

420
00:37:26,527 --> 00:37:29,607
I doubt it. Which way are the rooms?

421
00:37:29,766 --> 00:37:33,447
Right through there. But I wouldn't
go in there if I were you.

422
00:37:33,606 --> 00:37:37,487
- What are you gonna do? Call the cops?
- I don't have to.

423
00:37:37,647 --> 00:37:41,327
You'll be bustin' in on
the Chief of Police just up the hall.

424
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:56,127
... with no fix, we're gonna need
a con with a sure fire blow-off.

425
00:37:56,287 --> 00:37:58,566
We ought to play this guy
on the pay-off.

426
00:37:58,726 --> 00:38:00,967
It's the tightest thing we got.

427
00:38:01,127 --> 00:38:04,447
Lonnegan's not gonna sit still
for a standard play.

428
00:38:04,606 --> 00:38:08,967
Where does that leave us?
We can't con the pay-off to a banker.

429
00:38:09,126 --> 00:38:12,686
A wire. Never known a poker player
who didn't want to beat the pony.

430
00:38:12,846 --> 00:38:16,367
- The wire's been out of date 10 years.
- That's why he won't know it.

431
00:38:16,526 --> 00:38:18,287
I'm not sure I know it.

432
00:38:18,446 --> 00:38:20,967
It'll take two of us
working the inside.

433
00:38:21,127 --> 00:38:23,767
Any objections to Hooker as second man?

434
00:38:27,047 --> 00:38:30,927
All right. We'll give Lonnegan
a hook on the train and play him here.

435
00:38:31,086 --> 00:38:32,927
Think I can get in that poker game?

436
00:38:33,087 --> 00:38:35,486
Show up with money
and look like a sucker.

437
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,607
I also gotta win.

438
00:38:37,767 --> 00:38:41,127
Oh, by the way. Any of you guys
been passing bad money lately?

439
00:38:46,087 --> 00:38:49,527
If he comes in again,
stall him so I can get a look at him.

440
00:39:01,487 --> 00:39:04,367
Stenner had this place
till six months ago

441
00:39:04,527 --> 00:39:07,006
but he had to give it up.

442
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:10,247
Doesn't look so good right now
but maybe you can fix it up.

443
00:39:10,407 --> 00:39:13,886
Watch your step as you go in.

444
00:39:28,487 --> 00:39:32,567
- How does it look, Eddie?
- Big enough and it's off the street.

445
00:39:32,727 --> 00:39:35,247
I don't know. Kinda short notice.

446
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:37,726
Not sure we can get it done by Saturday.

447
00:39:37,886 --> 00:39:41,846
Got to. Gondorff's riding the mark
down from New York on the Century.

448
00:39:42,006 --> 00:39:44,927
We'll take it. The building at the end,
do you manage it?

449
00:39:45,087 --> 00:39:47,727
- For 15 years.
- I need a room facing this way.

450
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,167
- How much a week?
- Only rents by the month.

451
00:39:50,327 --> 00:39:52,846
250 for the two of them.

452
00:39:53,007 --> 00:39:56,847
- Last time I expect to see you here.
- Never heard of the place.

453
00:39:57,007 --> 00:39:59,447
A while since
I stocked a wire store.

454
00:39:59,607 --> 00:40:01,647
Not many mobs playing that any more.

455
00:40:01,807 --> 00:40:04,287
All we need
is the bookie set-up.

456
00:40:04,447 --> 00:40:07,447
I'll rent you everything
I've got for two grand.

457
00:40:07,607 --> 00:40:11,727
Phones, cages,
blackboards and ticker gear.

458
00:40:11,886 --> 00:40:15,087
If you want a counter and bar,
that's another grand.

459
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:16,807
That's pretty steep, Benny.

460
00:40:16,966 --> 00:40:19,687
Gondorff's a hot item.
Where'll I be if he gets hit?

461
00:40:19,846 --> 00:40:22,647
Just give us what you can,
we'll send a truck down.

462
00:40:22,807 --> 00:40:25,087
Do you want a flat rate or a percentage?

463
00:40:25,247 --> 00:40:27,687
- Who's the mark?
- Doyle Lonnegan.

464
00:40:31,086 --> 00:40:33,006
Flat rate.

465
00:40:47,566 --> 00:40:50,127
The guy in the black hat with the gimp.

466
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:01,447
He's not as tough as he thinks.

467
00:41:01,607 --> 00:41:03,847
Neither are we.

468
00:41:07,527 --> 00:41:09,127
- Mr Shaw?
- Right.

469
00:41:09,287 --> 00:41:10,687
You wanted to see me?

470
00:41:10,847 --> 00:41:13,407
Know about a poker game on this train?

471
00:41:13,567 --> 00:41:16,967
- A little.
- Can you get me in that game?

472
00:41:17,127 --> 00:41:20,127
I don't know.
There's usually a waiting list.

473
00:41:23,807 --> 00:41:26,366
That'll get you first alternate, sir.

474
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:33,646
I'll see what I can do.

475
00:41:37,206 --> 00:41:40,247
- Hey, Twist!
- Hey, boys! How are you?

476
00:41:40,407 --> 00:41:45,087
- How are you, Twist?
- You're lookin' like a million.

477
00:41:45,247 --> 00:41:48,087
Foley, you old son of a gun!

478
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:55,087
- Joiner, still working those shapes?
- Any number you want!

479
00:41:55,247 --> 00:41:57,847
- Good to see you, Twist.
- Lacey, good to see you.

480
00:41:58,007 --> 00:42:00,607
- Good to see you. Come on in.
- Dukey!

481
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:03,607
- When did you get back into town?
- Couple of days ago.

482
00:42:03,767 --> 00:42:05,687
Heard about Luther Coleman?

483
00:42:05,847 --> 00:42:08,527
The boys are passin' the hat
for Alva and the kids.

484
00:42:08,687 --> 00:42:10,607
Never seen the guys so worked up.

485
00:42:10,767 --> 00:42:12,567
Don't worry about it, Dukey.

486
00:42:12,726 --> 00:42:15,127
We're gonna send
a calling card of our own.

487
00:42:15,287 --> 00:42:19,247
Gondorff is setting up a wire store.
I need a 20-man boost.

488
00:42:19,407 --> 00:42:22,007
I got plenty of talent tonight.
Take your pick.

489
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:25,927
- Lace!
- These boys have gotta be the quill.

490
00:42:26,087 --> 00:42:29,687
Get me the sheet.
Let's see who's in town.

491
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:33,287
- Hey, Patty, give me the sheet.
- Sure.

492
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:51,087
Gondorff's already...

493
00:42:59,687 --> 00:43:02,367
Twist, you know this guy?

494
00:43:05,767 --> 00:43:08,247
No. I never saw him before.

495
00:43:08,407 --> 00:43:10,327
He's a dick, though.

496
00:43:19,126 --> 00:43:21,847
Hello, Snyder.
What are you doing up here?

497
00:43:22,006 --> 00:43:24,007
On vacation.

498
00:43:24,167 --> 00:43:26,447
Seen that friend of yours lately?

499
00:43:26,607 --> 00:43:29,966
No, he packed it in.
Enrolled in detective school.

500
00:43:38,487 --> 00:43:42,527
If you see him, tell him he'd better
pay up before I get to him.

501
00:43:53,087 --> 00:43:55,407
That son of a bitch.

502
00:43:57,767 --> 00:44:00,966
Thanks, Lace.
Let's see what we got here.

503
00:44:01,127 --> 00:44:07,847
Horse Face Lee, Slim Miller, Suitcase
Murphy, Big Alabama from New Orleans,

504
00:44:08,007 --> 00:44:10,566
Cryin' Jonesy and the Boone Kid
from Denver,

505
00:44:10,727 --> 00:44:14,246
Deafie Burke and Limehouse Chappie
from New York.

506
00:44:14,406 --> 00:44:18,366
These and the guys outside should
give you thirty or more to choose from.

507
00:44:18,526 --> 00:44:22,527
Good. Have 'em down at Stenner's
old pool hall before six o'clock.

508
00:44:22,687 --> 00:44:26,767
- We're gonna run the route tonight.
- OK, Twist. But...

509
00:44:26,927 --> 00:44:30,767
If this thing blows up,
I can't do you no good downtown.

510
00:44:30,927 --> 00:44:32,887
- Gondorff's Federal.
- Dukey...

511
00:44:33,046 --> 00:44:38,126
If this thing blows up, the Feds
will be the least of our problems.

512
00:44:52,767 --> 00:44:54,007
Yeah.

513
00:44:57,087 --> 00:44:59,047
- You in?
- I think so.

514
00:44:59,207 --> 00:45:01,726
Gave the kayducer a C-note.
Find out the deck?

515
00:45:01,887 --> 00:45:04,367
Usually plays with
a Tally-Ho fan or circle.

516
00:45:04,527 --> 00:45:06,007
I got you one of each.

517
00:45:06,167 --> 00:45:09,847
He likes to cold deck low.
Eights or nines.

518
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:12,006
That's nice work, JJ.

519
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:38,087
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't mention it, ma'am.

520
00:46:28,207 --> 00:46:31,127
She picked him clean.
He never missed it.

521
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,767
Looks like he's expecting a big night.

522
00:46:34,927 --> 00:46:37,287
Must be 15, 20 grand here.

523
00:46:39,207 --> 00:46:42,287
- He's waiting for you in the card room.
- Let him wait.

524
00:47:26,887 --> 00:47:30,526
- You worry about your end, kid.
- If we ever get to it.

525
00:47:35,407 --> 00:47:39,247
- You checked this guy out?
- Pleasant man, lot of cash.

526
00:47:39,407 --> 00:47:42,247
$200 suit, expensive luggage.
I'll vouch for him.

527
00:47:42,407 --> 00:47:46,247
- Why isn't he here then?
- Don't worry. He'll be here.

528
00:47:46,407 --> 00:47:47,847
All right.

529
00:47:57,767 --> 00:47:59,327
What are you doing?

530
00:48:02,086 --> 00:48:05,687
Always drink gin with a mark.
He can't tell if you cut it.

531
00:48:07,247 --> 00:48:09,807
- Two thousand for you, Mr Clayton.
- Thank you.

532
00:48:09,967 --> 00:48:12,887
- All right, shall we not wait?
- Let's go.

533
00:48:13,046 --> 00:48:16,687
- That's a good idea.
- Mr Clemens, give me the cards.

534
00:48:25,367 --> 00:48:28,087
Sorry I'm late, guys,
I was taking a crap.

535
00:48:28,247 --> 00:48:29,847
The name's Shaw.

536
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:32,927
Mr Shaw, meet Mr Jameson from Chicago.

537
00:48:33,086 --> 00:48:36,047
- How are you?
- Mr Lombard from Philadelphia.

538
00:48:36,207 --> 00:48:38,687
- Mr Lonnegan, New York.
- Pleased to meet you.

539
00:48:38,846 --> 00:48:40,447
Mr Clayton, Pittsburgh.

540
00:48:40,607 --> 00:48:44,687
Any you guys want to make a little book
in Chicago, I'm the guy to see.

541
00:48:45,927 --> 00:48:49,487
The game is straight poker.
$100 minimum, table stakes.

542
00:48:51,326 --> 00:48:56,047
Mr Shaw, this is a gentleman's game.
We assume you're good for your debts.

543
00:48:56,207 --> 00:49:00,246
- How much would you like?
- I'll start with 5,000.

544
00:49:05,407 --> 00:49:10,007
We usually require a tie at this table.
If you don't have one, we can get one.

545
00:49:10,167 --> 00:49:13,367
That'd be real nice of you, Mr Lonneman.

546
00:49:13,527 --> 00:49:15,007
Lonnegan.

547
00:49:29,247 --> 00:49:32,247
Curly Jackson,
worked with Gad Bryan outta Baltimore.

548
00:49:32,407 --> 00:49:33,846
Jackson?

549
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:36,967
Jackson... Oh, yeah.

550
00:49:37,127 --> 00:49:39,047
Ever played the wire, Curly?

551
00:49:39,206 --> 00:49:43,207
Roped for it long ago. I can shill,
mark board, anything you want.

552
00:49:43,367 --> 00:49:47,006
I don't run with riffraff
and only drink on weekends.

553
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:50,487
Me specialty's an Englishman.

554
00:49:50,647 --> 00:49:54,686
All right. We got a rack of suits,
pick yourself out a nice tweed one.

555
00:49:54,846 --> 00:49:58,247
That's all right,
I got all my own stuff.

556
00:50:03,447 --> 00:50:05,246
Doyle?

557
00:50:05,406 --> 00:50:06,887
One.

558
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:10,767
- Bill?
- I'll take one.

559
00:50:12,246 --> 00:50:15,286
- Shaw?
- Three.

560
00:50:16,727 --> 00:50:19,327
And the dealer will take one.

561
00:50:24,567 --> 00:50:26,806
Bet 500.

562
00:50:28,047 --> 00:50:29,647
I'll call.

563
00:50:31,606 --> 00:50:33,127
Call and raise.

564
00:50:35,286 --> 00:50:36,887
- 300.
- I'm out.

565
00:50:37,047 --> 00:50:38,927
Fold.

566
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,687
Your three...

567
00:50:44,847 --> 00:50:48,007
...and raise 500.

568
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,207
That's eight to me.

569
00:50:56,727 --> 00:50:58,127
Call.

570
00:51:02,087 --> 00:51:03,527
Jacks on top.

571
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:05,606
Beats me.

572
00:51:09,127 --> 00:51:10,406
Three tens.

573
00:51:15,527 --> 00:51:16,687
Tough luck, Lonnihan.

574
00:51:16,846 --> 00:51:19,767
That's what you get for playing
with your head up your ass.

575
00:51:19,927 --> 00:51:22,927
Couple more like that,
we can go to bed early.

576
00:51:24,487 --> 00:51:27,367
Name's Lonnegan. Doyle Lonnegan.

577
00:51:27,527 --> 00:51:30,487
You'll remember that
or get yourself another game.

578
00:51:31,806 --> 00:51:33,487
You follow?

579
00:51:39,047 --> 00:51:41,247
Bring it right up here.

580
00:51:42,527 --> 00:51:45,687
Hey, Eddie! We brought you a tap
into Moe Anenberg's wire.

581
00:51:45,847 --> 00:51:49,847
You'll get race results, odds,
scratches, pole positions, everything,

582
00:51:50,007 --> 00:51:52,126
just as fast as Western Union.

583
00:51:52,287 --> 00:51:55,927
- Will JJ know how to use that thing?
- All he's gotta do is read.

584
00:51:59,607 --> 00:52:02,167
The name is Joe Erie.

585
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:04,407
Joe Erie.

586
00:52:06,007 --> 00:52:08,607
You, uh, play for any particular mobs?

587
00:52:08,767 --> 00:52:10,447
No.

588
00:52:10,607 --> 00:52:12,487
Ever play the wire before, Erie?

589
00:52:12,647 --> 00:52:14,567
No.

590
00:52:14,726 --> 00:52:17,766
I never played no big con before
but, uh...

591
00:52:17,927 --> 00:52:21,447
Luther Coleman was a friend of mine
and I thought maybe...

592
00:52:22,207 --> 00:52:25,087
...there'd be something I could do.

593
00:52:25,247 --> 00:52:28,446
You get that nose
in Duke Boudreau's tonight?

594
00:52:31,206 --> 00:52:32,807
Yeah.

595
00:52:34,646 --> 00:52:36,807
You got moxie, Erie.

596
00:52:36,966 --> 00:52:38,927
Get yourself a suit.

597
00:52:39,087 --> 00:52:40,567
Thanks.

598
00:52:48,886 --> 00:52:50,727
I'll bet three.

599
00:52:50,887 --> 00:52:53,607
Call and raise 200.

600
00:52:55,447 --> 00:52:56,967
Call.

601
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:01,607
- No.
- I'm out.

602
00:53:01,767 --> 00:53:03,327
Call.

603
00:53:03,487 --> 00:53:05,567
Aces over.

604
00:53:06,567 --> 00:53:08,366
Three cowboys.

605
00:53:08,527 --> 00:53:10,687
All red. Queen high.

606
00:53:11,687 --> 00:53:14,727
- Finishes me.
- Don't worry, pal.

607
00:53:17,006 --> 00:53:21,207
They wouldn't let you in if you weren't
a chump. Lombard'll be joining you.

608
00:53:21,367 --> 00:53:25,646
I've had enough of this game
and quite enough of this company.

609
00:53:25,806 --> 00:53:28,607
Check me out, Clemens.

610
00:53:28,767 --> 00:53:32,727
- I guess that leaves the three of us.
- Yes, Mr Shaw.

611
00:53:32,887 --> 00:53:37,527
It just leaves us three. I think we
should take a break for five minutes.

612
00:53:37,687 --> 00:53:40,326
Tempers seem to be running
a little high.

613
00:53:40,487 --> 00:53:42,887
Oh, come on! I just started to do good.

614
00:53:54,167 --> 00:53:57,087
- Stack me a cooler.
- We'll be in the station in an hour.

615
00:53:57,247 --> 00:53:59,327
The others are the losers. You're OK.

616
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:02,927
Fix me a deck, threes and nines.
I'll cut in on Clayton's deal.

617
00:54:03,086 --> 00:54:05,367
- What do you want Clayton to get?
- Nothing.

618
00:54:05,527 --> 00:54:08,207
I'm gonna bust that bastard bookie
in one play.

619
00:54:12,607 --> 00:54:15,367
400 to you, Mr Jameson. You're even.

620
00:54:15,527 --> 00:54:17,366
This wasn't my night.

621
00:54:33,006 --> 00:54:36,047
- I need it.
- Know what time we get in?

622
00:54:36,207 --> 00:54:37,647
No, I don't.

623
00:54:38,527 --> 00:54:40,327
Hey, where's your ante?

624
00:55:13,247 --> 00:55:14,686
500.

625
00:55:17,846 --> 00:55:20,326
Your five, and one thousand.

626
00:55:21,487 --> 00:55:23,447
I'll fold.

627
00:55:25,246 --> 00:55:26,567
I'll play.

628
00:55:28,286 --> 00:55:29,767
Cards.

629
00:55:31,006 --> 00:55:32,367
Two.

630
00:55:36,487 --> 00:55:37,647
Three.

631
00:56:05,087 --> 00:56:06,367
500.

632
00:56:08,807 --> 00:56:13,287
Your 500 and one thousand.

633
00:56:19,726 --> 00:56:22,927
Your 1,000 and I'll raise you 2,000.

634
00:56:27,287 --> 00:56:29,687
Your 2,000...

635
00:56:33,327 --> 00:56:35,447
Mr Clemens.

636
00:56:35,607 --> 00:56:38,167
Give me $10,000 more.

637
00:57:21,127 --> 00:57:22,847
I'll call.

638
00:57:23,927 --> 00:57:26,887
Four nines.

639
00:57:35,207 --> 00:57:37,047
Four Jacks.

640
00:57:47,287 --> 00:57:50,447
You owe me 15 grand, pal.

641
00:58:03,247 --> 00:58:06,846
- Must have left my wallet in my room.
- Don't hand me any of that crap.

642
00:58:07,007 --> 00:58:10,567
Bring your own money to a game.
How do I know you won't take a powder?

643
00:58:10,727 --> 00:58:12,647
- No, Doyle.
- Tell you what I'll do.

644
00:58:13,207 --> 00:58:15,527
I'll send a boy to your room
in five minutes.

645
00:58:15,687 --> 00:58:18,766
Have the money or it'll be
round Chicago that you welshed.

646
00:58:18,927 --> 00:58:21,526
You won't be able
to get a game ofjacks.

647
00:58:21,687 --> 00:58:24,567
Cash me in for the rest of these bums.

648
00:58:38,607 --> 00:58:40,247
You're on, kid.

649
00:58:41,887 --> 00:58:44,647
- I tell you, it's a hard act to follow.
- How'd it go?

650
00:58:44,807 --> 00:58:46,807
We got workin' money.

651
00:58:46,967 --> 00:58:48,487
- OK?
- Yeah.

652
00:58:48,647 --> 00:58:50,726
- He's steamin'.
- Yeah.

653
00:58:50,887 --> 00:58:52,567
Watch yourself.

654
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:02,806
I know I gave him four threes!

655
00:59:02,967 --> 00:59:06,007
He had to make a switch.
We can't let him get away with that.

656
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:10,327
What was I supposed to do?!
Call him for cheating better than me?

657
00:59:27,807 --> 00:59:29,806
Name's Kelly. Shaw sent me.

658
00:59:36,887 --> 00:59:41,327
Your boss is quite a card player,
Mr Kelly. How does he do it?

659
00:59:41,486 --> 00:59:43,487
He cheats.

660
00:59:44,807 --> 00:59:47,646
Then I'll keep my money
and we'll have another game.

661
00:59:47,807 --> 00:59:49,846
You don't have any to keep.

662
00:59:53,887 --> 00:59:57,246
Here's your wallet.
He hired a dame to take it from you.

663
00:59:57,406 --> 00:59:59,287
Shaw's been planning for months,

664
00:59:59,446 --> 01:00:02,127
waited for you to cheat him
so he could clip you.

665
01:00:03,927 --> 01:00:06,846
Who do you think you're talking to?
Nobody sets me up.

666
01:00:07,006 --> 01:00:11,087
- Take him and put one in his ear.
- There are witnesses.

667
01:00:11,246 --> 01:00:15,127
Go get that other son of a bitch and
dump 'em in the first tunnel we hit.

668
01:00:15,287 --> 01:00:17,247
We'll be in the station in a minute.

669
01:00:17,406 --> 01:00:21,287
It won't look good,
you killing a guy you owe money to.

670
01:00:21,447 --> 01:00:24,126
There's better ways of taking him down.

671
01:00:27,846 --> 01:00:30,647
What do you think Shaw'd do
if he knew I told you this?

672
01:00:34,006 --> 01:00:35,767
OK.

673
01:00:37,487 --> 01:00:39,527
Why the rat?

674
01:00:44,726 --> 01:00:48,527
I wanna take over his operation
and I need you to help me break him.

675
01:00:55,767 --> 01:00:58,247
- Where's my money?
- Shaw's got it.

676
01:00:58,407 --> 01:01:00,687
How could I ask him for it back?

677
01:01:02,207 --> 01:01:03,887
We're pullin' in.

678
01:01:10,887 --> 01:01:12,686
I'm giving you a lift home.

679
01:01:13,607 --> 01:01:16,447
- I'm supposed to go with Shaw.
- Explain it somehow.

680
01:01:16,607 --> 01:01:19,566
- He's expecting me.
- I'm giving you a lift home.

681
01:01:19,727 --> 01:01:21,447
You follow?

682
01:01:24,807 --> 01:01:27,646
Yeah, sure... Sure thing.

683
01:01:50,887 --> 01:01:54,367
- What makes you think you can beat him?
- I've planned it for two years.

684
01:01:54,526 --> 01:01:57,927
I know his organisation backwards.
I need someone respectable.

685
01:01:58,086 --> 01:02:01,167
- But not completely legit.
- I'm a banker. That's legit.

686
01:02:01,327 --> 01:02:04,526
All you do is put down a bet
at Shaw's place, I'll do the rest.

687
01:02:04,686 --> 01:02:07,566
I'll supply the money,
the information...

688
01:02:07,727 --> 01:02:11,247
- And the money you've come to collect?
- I'll tell him you paid it.

689
01:02:11,406 --> 01:02:15,287
He trusts me. Help me and I'll pay
your money back out of my own pocket.

690
01:02:15,447 --> 01:02:18,207
- It's worth that much to you?
- Yeah.

691
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:21,367
Oh, yeah. Maybe a couple of million.

692
01:02:27,846 --> 01:02:30,927
Where do you come from, Kelly?

693
01:02:31,087 --> 01:02:34,487
From the east side of New York,
a place called Five Points.

694
01:02:34,647 --> 01:02:37,767
- But I got out of there.
- Out and up, huh?

695
01:02:39,366 --> 01:02:40,927
Hey, Floyd?

696
01:02:41,087 --> 01:02:43,247
Gonna have to keep you
away from this guy.

697
01:02:43,407 --> 01:02:45,966
You're liable to get ideas.

698
01:03:02,207 --> 01:03:05,767
I'll be at Klein's Drug Store,
660 South Marshall.

699
01:03:05,927 --> 01:03:07,807
At 1.30, if you're interested.

700
01:03:07,967 --> 01:03:11,287
If I'm not there by quarter to two,
I'm not coming.

701
01:04:21,447 --> 01:04:23,247
Hey, Hooker. How'd it go?

702
01:04:23,407 --> 01:04:24,767
Jake.

703
01:04:26,967 --> 01:04:29,567
- Everything go OK?
- Yeah, sure. Hell, easy.

704
01:04:39,727 --> 01:04:41,687
- No sign of trouble?
- No.

705
01:04:41,847 --> 01:04:43,926
- Lonnegan?
- I gave him the breakdown.

706
01:04:44,087 --> 01:04:46,847
- And?
- Good. He threatened to kill me.

707
01:04:47,007 --> 01:04:50,527
If they don't do that,
you're not getting to 'em.

708
01:05:07,887 --> 01:05:09,446
Hello, Doyle.

709
01:05:10,567 --> 01:05:12,967
All right, Riley,
what the hell happened?

710
01:05:13,126 --> 01:05:16,647
- We missed him.
- He made a fool out of you.

711
01:05:16,807 --> 01:05:19,247
No way he could have known
we was in that room.

712
01:05:19,407 --> 01:05:23,566
- Somebody must've wised him up.
- What does Cole say about that?

713
01:05:23,727 --> 01:05:25,766
I don't know. He took it hard.

714
01:05:25,927 --> 01:05:28,727
Get out of here, Riley.

715
01:05:28,887 --> 01:05:30,487
Put Salino onto it.

716
01:05:30,647 --> 01:05:34,126
Salino? Why waste our best people
on a small time job?

717
01:05:34,287 --> 01:05:38,167
This is a nickel and dime grifter
we're after. They'll get him next time.

718
01:05:38,327 --> 01:05:41,767
All they did was shoot up
a neighbourhood, wake a few cops.

719
01:05:41,927 --> 01:05:44,567
- Yeah, but...
- I told you to put Salino onto it.

720
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:48,407
May take a little time
but there won't be any holes.

721
01:05:48,567 --> 01:05:50,247
Tell Cole I want to see him.

722
01:05:50,407 --> 01:05:53,847
He won't be coming in,
not to get bounced off a job anyway.

723
01:05:54,006 --> 01:05:57,007
This is Salino's job, Vince.

724
01:05:57,166 --> 01:06:00,127
Cole wants to muscle in on it,
that's his business,

725
01:06:00,287 --> 01:06:03,247
but Salino won't like it.
Get me the books.

726
01:06:41,326 --> 01:06:44,486
The odds on the third race
at Lincoln Fields are wrong.

727
01:06:44,647 --> 01:06:46,727
Just a minute, I'll get 'em for you.

728
01:06:46,887 --> 01:06:50,327
Don't worry so much, lad.
You're gonna be all right.

729
01:06:50,487 --> 01:06:53,686
Just stay to the back
the first time around.

730
01:06:55,767 --> 01:06:58,287
Put a little of this on your nose.

731
01:07:40,087 --> 01:07:41,647
Kelly.

732
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:50,127
- You should always look to the back.
- I was afraid you wouldn't show.

733
01:07:50,287 --> 01:07:53,327
- We haven't got much time.
- Get on with it, then.

734
01:07:54,287 --> 01:07:57,167
Some time after two,
a guy's gonna call on that phone

735
01:07:57,326 --> 01:07:59,526
and give you the name of a horse.

736
01:08:00,766 --> 01:08:04,326
All you gotta do is take this two grand
across the street to Shaw's place

737
01:08:04,487 --> 01:08:05,966
and bet it on that pony.

738
01:08:06,127 --> 01:08:11,326
Nothing to it. But we only got three
or four minutes after you get the call.

739
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:14,527
- You won't break him with a $2,000 bet.
- This is a test.

740
01:08:14,687 --> 01:08:18,247
The big one comes later. But be careful
with that, that's all I got.

741
01:08:18,407 --> 01:08:22,607
- You'll pay me out of your own pocket?
- Yes. After the race.

742
01:08:23,607 --> 01:08:25,807
I gotta get back before Shaw misses me.

743
01:08:25,967 --> 01:08:27,407
Good luck.

744
01:09:20,846 --> 01:09:23,127
Yeah...? Go ahead.

745
01:09:27,166 --> 01:09:28,767
Got it.

746
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:50,007
Yeah?

747
01:09:50,167 --> 01:09:54,527
<i>Bluenote to win
in the fourth race at Narragansett.</i>

748
01:10:29,247 --> 01:10:32,487
<i>Heading for home,
it's Lady Scout, Speed Queen,</i>

749
01:10:32,647 --> 01:10:34,207
<i>Lady Trust and Miss Petrina.</i>

750
01:10:34,366 --> 01:10:38,447
<i>Into the stretch, Lady Scout by a head,
Speed Queen and Miss Petrina.</i>

751
01:10:38,607 --> 01:10:41,567
<i>And at the wire,
it's Speed Queen the winnerl</i>

752
01:10:41,727 --> 01:10:44,167
<i>Lady Scout placed
and Miss Petrina showed.</i>

753
01:10:44,327 --> 01:10:48,687
<i>Post numbers two, five and one.
They got off at 23...</i>

754
01:10:48,847 --> 01:10:50,727
Look at that.

755
01:10:52,407 --> 01:10:55,047
He's got his apes with him.

756
01:10:55,207 --> 01:10:58,567
We're gonna have to
do something about that.

757
01:10:58,727 --> 01:11:02,967
<i>...Bubblesome is ten,
Beefsteak seven,</i>

758
01:11:03,127 --> 01:11:05,967
<i>Vote Boy six, Kerry Patch twelve,</i>

759
01:11:06,127 --> 01:11:08,727
<i>and Bluenote seven to one.</i>

760
01:11:09,687 --> 01:11:12,807
<i>This is your last call for
the third race at Lincoln Fields.</i>

761
01:11:12,967 --> 01:11:17,207
<i>- They're going to the post...
- There he goes.</i>

762
01:11:19,847 --> 01:11:25,727
<i>At Detroit, the winner Speed Queen,
paid $7.20, $4.60 and $3.40.</i>

763
01:11:25,887 --> 01:11:28,047
<i>Lady Scout, $7 and $4.20.</i>

764
01:11:28,207 --> 01:11:30,367
<i>Miss Petrina paid $4.00.</i>

765
01:11:30,527 --> 01:11:35,247
<i>Last flash at Narragansett.
Lady Higloss is 6 to 5, Chancing...</i>

766
01:11:37,407 --> 01:11:40,367
I'd think you'd get tired of losing,
Harrigan.

767
01:11:40,527 --> 01:11:42,727
Thank you.

768
01:11:42,887 --> 01:11:46,967
Bluenote. $2,000 to win,
fourth race, Narragansett.

769
01:11:47,127 --> 01:11:52,487
Make sure you see the cash. He's got a
name for betting money he doesn't have.

770
01:11:54,047 --> 01:11:57,407
<i>This is Arnold Rowe,
your caller for the fourth race,</i>

771
01:11:57,567 --> 01:12:01,807
<i>the Mansfield Handicap

773
01:12:05,367 --> 01:12:09,047
<i>The flag is up

774
01:12:09,207 --> 01:12:12,207
<i>It's Bubblesome to the front,
followed by Lady Higloss,</i>

775
01:12:12,367 --> 01:12:16,447
<i>Vote Boy, Chancing, Beefsteak, Kerry
Patch, and Bluenote trails the field.</i>

776
01:12:16,607 --> 01:12:19,687
<i>Round the Clubhouse turn,
it's Bubblesome ahead,</i>

777
01:12:19,846 --> 01:12:24,047
<i>Lady Higloss by one, followed by Vote
Boy, Beefsteak, Kerry Patch, Bluenote.</i>

778
01:12:24,207 --> 01:12:28,127
<i>The second turn, it's Chancing by
a length, Lady Higloss on the rail,</i>

779
01:12:28,287 --> 01:12:30,927
<i>Vote Boy, followed by Bubblesome,
Beefsteak...</i>

780
01:12:31,086 --> 01:12:33,166
- Come on, Chancing.
- Hey, uh...

781
01:12:33,327 --> 01:12:35,607
<i>Lady Higloss driving on the rail...</i>

782
01:12:35,766 --> 01:12:41,287
Lady Higloss is a hell of a finisher.
Chancing's gonna have to open up.

783
01:12:41,447 --> 01:12:44,126
Know anything about
a horse named Bluenote?

784
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:47,846
He never done much, probably in there
just to round out the field.

785
01:12:48,007 --> 01:12:50,927
Chancing's where you wanna
have your money.

786
01:12:53,687 --> 01:12:57,487
- Great tip you handed me, kid.
- Give him time.

787
01:12:57,647 --> 01:13:00,127
<i>...here comes Bluenote,
on the outside.</i>

788
01:13:00,287 --> 01:13:02,567
Nice work, Erie. He loves you.

789
01:13:02,727 --> 01:13:06,807
<i>Chancing is struggling,
and now it's Lady Higloss and Bluenote.</i>

<i>Head to head, neck to neck,</i>

791
01:13:09,207 --> 01:13:12,287
<i>it's Lady Higloss, Bluenote...</i>

792
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:15,327
<i>...and Bluenote wins it by a nose.</i>

793
01:13:15,487 --> 01:13:19,567
<i>Lady Higloss is second by three,
Chancing is third by one.</i>

794
01:13:19,727 --> 01:13:22,767
<i>- They got off...
- Who the blazes is Bluenote?</i>

795
01:13:22,927 --> 01:13:26,967
<i>The winner, Bluenote,
paid $16.00, $9.40 and $6.00...</i>

796
01:13:27,127 --> 01:13:30,287
So you want your money on Chancing, huh?

797
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:33,246
<i>Chancing paid $3.80.</i>

<i>They're going to the gate
at Belmont and here are the odds...</i>

800
01:13:48,967 --> 01:13:51,606
Both of those garbage men belong to you?

801
01:13:51,766 --> 01:13:54,887
Get 'em out and don't bring 'em back.
This is a class joint.

802
01:13:55,046 --> 01:13:57,967
Hey, you! Kelly!

803
01:13:58,127 --> 01:14:01,247
- Yes, sir.
- Run those bums outta here.

804
01:14:01,407 --> 01:14:06,166
- Uh, Mr Shaw...
- Don't give me any of your lip, kid.

805
01:14:06,327 --> 01:14:08,287
Run 'em outta here.

806
01:14:08,447 --> 01:14:10,367
<i>The winner is Panic Relief,</i>

That's it, fellas.

815
01:14:42,407 --> 01:14:45,127
- I want to repeat that...
- All right, JJ.

816
01:14:49,766 --> 01:14:51,686
What do you say, pal?

817
01:15:01,166 --> 01:15:03,967
Yeah... Mm-hm...

818
01:15:06,766 --> 01:15:08,407
He's on his way.

819
01:15:22,207 --> 01:15:23,967
Hi, Mutt.

820
01:15:24,127 --> 01:15:26,047
What do you say, Jeff?

821
01:15:27,807 --> 01:15:30,407
- What did I tell you?
- You got lucky once.

822
01:15:30,567 --> 01:15:33,847
- Lucky, hell. I can do it every time.
- Why don't you?

823
01:15:34,007 --> 01:15:36,327
Because it's better
to do it all at once.

824
01:15:37,247 --> 01:15:39,447
We're gonna put down
400 grand next week.

825
01:15:39,607 --> 01:15:43,607
At 5-1 odds, that's two million.
20% is yours if you stick with us.

826
01:15:43,767 --> 01:15:46,966
- Got a system, Kelly?
- No.

827
01:15:47,127 --> 01:15:51,086
- You can still lose with a system.
- You're past-posting, aren't you?

828
01:15:54,887 --> 01:15:56,487
Could be.

829
01:15:56,647 --> 01:15:57,687
How?

830
01:15:58,886 --> 01:16:01,727
- You gonna stay in?
- Not till I get some answers.

831
01:16:06,407 --> 01:16:11,047
I got a partner downtown. He runs the
central office for the Western Union.

832
01:16:11,207 --> 01:16:15,607
Race results from all over the country
go across his desk to the bookies.

833
01:16:15,766 --> 01:16:20,207
He holds 'em up for a couple of minutes
till he can call us and bet on a winner.

834
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:24,207
He releases the results, we clean up
on a race that's already been run.

835
01:16:24,367 --> 01:16:28,007
You can't miss unless
Western Union get a hold of it.

836
01:16:35,727 --> 01:16:37,767
Got the 400 grand yet?

837
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:39,607
No, not yet, but...

838
01:16:40,726 --> 01:16:44,127
- There's only a grand here.
- I'll make another bet tomorrow.

839
01:16:44,287 --> 01:16:46,766
What the hell is this?
I got 16 grand coming.

840
01:16:46,927 --> 01:16:50,847
You owe me 15 grand already. If your
set-up's good, there's plenty more.

841
01:16:51,007 --> 01:16:54,407
- I decide when to place bets.
- Not if you want me to make them.

842
01:16:54,567 --> 01:16:57,567
I gotta talk to my partner.
We can't expose too much.

843
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:59,287
- I'll talk to him.
- No.

844
01:16:59,447 --> 01:17:02,607
You've been waiting a long time
for this. Don't ruin it.

845
01:17:02,767 --> 01:17:04,927
I'll pick you up tomorrow at three.

846
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:06,887
You follow?

847
01:17:38,766 --> 01:17:43,247
Twist, I told him the tale but he wants
to see my partner tomorrow at three.

848
01:17:43,406 --> 01:17:44,887
<i>- Three o'clock?
- Yeah.</i>

849
01:17:45,047 --> 01:17:48,047
We'll never get it set up.
Any chance to talk him out of it?

850
01:17:48,206 --> 01:17:51,207
None. I'd have stalled
but I had no friends in the room.

851
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:55,287
Yeah. We'll have to play him on the fly.
I'll get Eddie looking for a place.

852
01:17:55,447 --> 01:17:58,407
<i>- Let me know when you got something.
- Sure thing, tootsy.</i>

853
01:17:59,807 --> 01:18:01,207
All right, Hooker!

854
01:18:06,046 --> 01:18:07,447
Agh!

855
01:18:08,887 --> 01:18:10,527
Stop him!

856
01:19:17,967 --> 01:19:19,367
Hooker!

857
01:19:19,527 --> 01:19:21,007
Hooker!

858
01:19:21,167 --> 01:19:23,607
I'll get you, you rat!

859
01:19:23,767 --> 01:19:25,206
Hooker!

860
01:19:30,567 --> 01:19:33,846
- Why didn't you tell me about Snyder?
- I thought I'd lost him.

861
01:19:34,007 --> 01:19:37,327
You found him again
and we're gonna have to do something.

862
01:19:37,487 --> 01:19:40,367
- What else haven't you told me?
- Nothing, that's all.

863
01:19:40,527 --> 01:19:42,486
Hold still.

864
01:19:42,647 --> 01:19:44,887
Why did you move out of your room?

865
01:19:45,047 --> 01:19:47,047
It was too noisy.

866
01:19:47,207 --> 01:19:50,927
You can't play your friends
like marks, Hooker.

867
01:19:51,087 --> 01:19:53,887
Know how easy it is
for Lonnegan's guys to get you?

868
01:19:54,047 --> 01:19:57,846
All we need is a couple of days
to get the son of a bitch and nail him.

869
01:19:58,007 --> 01:20:00,527
You just won't learn, will you?

870
01:20:00,687 --> 01:20:04,447
You come here, I teach you stuff
that five guys in the whole world know.

871
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:07,647
But all you wanna do
is run down a bullet.

872
01:20:07,807 --> 01:20:11,686
I'm asking a couple of days.
I can stay clear that long.

873
01:20:13,886 --> 01:20:16,766
Christ, they'll probably
miss you and hit me.

874
01:20:51,326 --> 01:20:53,047
- Hey.
- Hi.

875
01:20:54,447 --> 01:20:56,126
What'll you have?

876
01:20:56,287 --> 01:21:00,926
- Give me the blueplate special.
- One blueplate special.

877
01:21:30,047 --> 01:21:32,007
- You done?
- Yeah.

878
01:21:32,167 --> 01:21:35,447
- Guess I should have had the meatloaf.
- It isn't any better.

879
01:21:39,047 --> 01:21:41,406
- Hey, where's June?
- She quit.

880
01:21:41,567 --> 01:21:45,366
I'm filling in for a couple of days
until I can get a train out of here.

881
01:21:45,527 --> 01:21:47,927
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

882
01:21:48,087 --> 01:21:50,607
Depends on what train I get on.

883
01:21:55,847 --> 01:21:57,487
Keep it.

884
01:21:57,647 --> 01:21:59,687
Thanks.

885
01:22:14,687 --> 01:22:16,086
Let's go.

886
01:22:37,607 --> 01:22:40,366
Excuse me, ma'am,
we're looking for Mister, uh...

887
01:22:40,526 --> 01:22:42,286
- Harmon.
- Mr Harmon's office.

888
01:22:42,446 --> 01:22:44,287
- Mr Harmon?
- Yeah.

889
01:22:44,447 --> 01:22:47,567
- Got an order for a painting job.
- For Mr Harmon's office?

890
01:22:47,727 --> 01:22:50,647
- That's right.
- Hold on just a second.

891
01:23:05,047 --> 01:23:06,527
Hi.

892
01:23:06,687 --> 01:23:09,726
- Where to?
- 110 South Wabash.

893
01:23:09,887 --> 01:23:12,367
110 South Wabash. Get goin'.

894
01:23:15,007 --> 01:23:18,887
- What happened to your face?
- Got into a fight with a raggle.

895
01:23:19,046 --> 01:23:21,407
Cut me with her ring.

896
01:23:21,567 --> 01:23:27,127
Lay off the skirts. Won't find my boys
messing around with that kind of trash.

897
01:23:35,407 --> 01:23:39,127
Brigham signed it.
Can't understand why he didn't tell me.

898
01:23:39,287 --> 01:23:43,206
All them supervisors think
they're too good for ordinary people.

899
01:23:43,367 --> 01:23:47,767
- He said this place was a mess.
- We won't keep you out for long.

900
01:23:47,927 --> 01:23:49,366
Why can't I work in here?

901
01:23:49,527 --> 01:23:53,206
We gotta cover the floor, everything,
so we don't spill on nothing.

902
01:23:53,367 --> 01:23:56,287
If you want a tarp on your head,
you're welcome to it.

903
01:23:56,447 --> 01:24:00,247
- All right, how long will you be?
- An hour or two, it's a small job.

904
01:24:45,247 --> 01:24:47,647
We'll go in the side door, here.

905
01:24:58,247 --> 01:25:00,087
Hiya, Les.

906
01:25:00,247 --> 01:25:02,767
This is Doyle Lonnegan.
This is Les Harman.

907
01:25:02,927 --> 01:25:05,847
How do you do?
What did you bring him here for?

908
01:25:06,007 --> 01:25:08,127
- We could...
- ... operation.

909
01:25:08,287 --> 01:25:12,527
I'm having the place painted.
We can't talk in here now.

910
01:25:12,687 --> 01:25:15,967
We'll have to find someplace else.
Excuse me.

911
01:25:20,046 --> 01:25:22,527
Miss Barnes,
I'm going home a little early.

912
01:25:22,687 --> 01:25:28,167
If there are any calls, tell them
they can reach me here tomorrow morning.

913
01:25:28,327 --> 01:25:30,007
Mr Lonnegan.

914
01:26:01,326 --> 01:26:04,047
- I wanna see it one more time.
- I can't do it.

915
01:26:04,206 --> 01:26:07,047
- We've got inspectors all over.
- One more time...

916
01:26:07,206 --> 01:26:09,807
We've got 400 grand coming in next week.

917
01:26:09,966 --> 01:26:12,727
You wanna risk that on a lousy 15 Gs?

918
01:26:12,887 --> 01:26:16,287
If it works again tomorrow,
I'll finance the whole thing.

919
01:26:16,447 --> 01:26:19,447
Half a million dollars. 60-40 split.

920
01:26:19,607 --> 01:26:23,727
What? I told you, we already got a guy.
What am I supposed to say to him?

921
01:26:23,887 --> 01:26:26,406
You say to him what you want.

922
01:26:26,566 --> 01:26:30,647
From what I know of your operation,
I'd worry about making me happy.

923
01:26:30,806 --> 01:26:34,847
Your guy says a week, how do we know it
won't be a month? Lonnegan's a banker.

924
01:26:35,007 --> 01:26:36,566
He can get money.

925
01:26:36,727 --> 01:26:39,847
We can't keep cleaning up
at Shaw's place. He'll get wise.

926
01:26:40,006 --> 01:26:42,967
All right. We'll go for short odds.

927
01:26:43,127 --> 01:26:45,206
- But it's still...
- You follow?

928
01:27:05,447 --> 01:27:07,687
Are you Lieutenant William Snyder?

929
01:27:08,727 --> 01:27:10,726
I don't know. What's up?

930
01:27:10,887 --> 01:27:13,046
FBI.

931
01:27:13,206 --> 01:27:15,526
Special Agent Polk
would like a few words.

932
01:27:15,687 --> 01:27:17,647
You got a couple of minutes?

933
01:27:17,807 --> 01:27:19,287
Yeah, sure.

934
01:27:45,447 --> 01:27:49,487
No, it's gotta be south of the river.
Probably this section, here.

935
01:27:49,647 --> 01:27:54,967
31st, 39th, Morgan and Halstead,
that's this section here.

936
01:27:55,927 --> 01:27:59,487
Let's break it into two sections,
along 35th.

937
01:28:00,567 --> 01:28:02,846
What is this? I got work to do.

938
01:28:03,847 --> 01:28:08,367
Sit down and shut up, will you?
Try not to live up to my expectations.

939
01:28:09,846 --> 01:28:14,086
Take two men, work your way south
from 31st to 35th, Morgan and Halstead.

940
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:17,167
Go into every place
and let me know what you find.

941
01:28:23,647 --> 01:28:26,687
We been told you know a hustle artist
named Johnny Hooker.

942
01:28:27,686 --> 01:28:30,047
- Know him or not?
- I don't know where he is.

943
01:28:30,207 --> 01:28:35,007
We do. He's chumming around
with a big C named Henry Gondorff.

944
01:28:35,167 --> 01:28:36,326
Ring any bells?

945
01:28:36,487 --> 01:28:39,127
Every bunco man
in the country knows Gondorff.

946
01:28:39,287 --> 01:28:42,527
There's word he's gonna run a con
on the South Side.

947
01:28:42,687 --> 01:28:45,967
We got a year-old Florida warrant on him
but it's a thin beef.

948
01:28:46,127 --> 01:28:49,247
He can beat it in court
unless we catch him cold.

949
01:28:49,407 --> 01:28:52,047
All we want you to do
is pick up Hooker for us.

950
01:28:52,207 --> 01:28:54,487
Why don't you pick him up yourself?

951
01:28:54,647 --> 01:28:58,487
If word gets out the Feds are in on it,
Gondorff'll fold the whole thing.

952
01:28:58,647 --> 01:29:03,687
Wouldn't that be too bad? You'd have
to move out of this nice office you got.

953
01:29:06,407 --> 01:29:09,207
Don't crack wise with me, flatfoot.

954
01:29:09,366 --> 01:29:12,207
I've spent too much time
eating Gondorff's dust

955
01:29:12,367 --> 01:29:15,727
while you guys in the bunco squads
get rich tipping him off.

956
01:29:15,887 --> 01:29:18,367
That's not gonna happen this time.

957
01:29:18,527 --> 01:29:21,566
We're not gonna
tell the police we're here.

958
01:29:21,726 --> 01:29:25,647
Keep your mouth shut and do a job,
there'll be reward bucks for you.

959
01:29:25,807 --> 01:29:27,486
And you'd better take it,

960
01:29:27,647 --> 01:29:30,727
cos I can make you
work for us without it.

961
01:29:30,887 --> 01:29:33,007
What the hell good is Hooker to you?

962
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:35,727
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.

963
01:29:35,887 --> 01:29:37,967
He'll never do it.

964
01:29:38,127 --> 01:29:40,167
I think he will.

965
01:30:00,567 --> 01:30:03,527
He's there. Let's get on it.

966
01:30:05,046 --> 01:30:08,007
- What's the line on Exponent?
- Uh...

967
01:30:08,167 --> 01:30:10,487
Five to one.

968
01:30:10,647 --> 01:30:12,767
- How's it goin'?
- Nothing yet.

969
01:30:12,927 --> 01:30:15,647
Had a good one at Lincoln Fields
but he faded.

970
01:30:15,807 --> 01:30:20,686
Best we had the last hour was
Love Potion at Rockingham, 5-1.

971
01:30:20,847 --> 01:30:23,047
All the longshots comin' in today.

972
01:30:24,007 --> 01:30:26,927
- Take 4-1 if you have to.
- OK.

973
01:30:29,287 --> 01:30:31,007
Forget the boodle, Eddie.

974
01:30:31,167 --> 01:30:34,247
He could hit us for 15 grand at 4-1.
We can't handle that.

975
01:30:34,406 --> 01:30:36,127
- Give him the shut-out.
- OK.

976
01:30:36,287 --> 01:30:39,127
OK, Billie, here we go.

977
01:30:39,287 --> 01:30:42,607
At the wire, it's Wrecking Crew,
the winner by five.

978
01:30:42,766 --> 01:30:46,047
Black Mischief second,
Whichaway third,

979
01:30:46,206 --> 01:30:50,167
Wrecking Crew was... 3-1,
that's our boy.

980
01:30:54,047 --> 01:30:55,246
Henry!

981
01:30:58,887 --> 01:31:01,487
Here we go, we got a 3-1
at Belmont, Wrecking Crew.

982
01:31:26,007 --> 01:31:28,767
<i>- Yeah?
- Sixth race at Belmont.</i>

983
01:31:28,927 --> 01:31:33,847
<i>Wrecking Crew to win, Black Mischief
to place, Whichaway to show.</i>

984
01:31:43,647 --> 01:31:45,367
Wait here.

985
01:31:49,527 --> 01:31:54,207
<i>The winner, Time To Go,
paid $7.00, $5.40 and $3.80.</i>

986
01:31:54,366 --> 01:31:57,687
<i>Joy Flag, $6.00 and $4.20.</i>

987
01:31:57,847 --> 01:32:00,406
<i>Readily paid $3.80 to show.</i>

988
01:32:00,567 --> 01:32:04,847
<i>The weather's threatening but the track
is fast there in Salem, New Hampshire.</i>

989
01:32:06,967 --> 01:32:10,006
<i>Here's a latejockey change
at Rockingham,</i>

990
01:32:10,167 --> 01:32:13,566
<i>RC Stark will ride ltsie Bitsie.</i>

991
01:32:13,726 --> 01:32:18,926
<i>- That's RC Stark...
- 5,000 on Black Mischief at Belmont.</i>

992
01:32:20,446 --> 01:32:22,766
Could you hurry up there, please?

993
01:32:22,927 --> 01:32:24,966
<i>Wrecking Crew is 3-1.</i>

994
01:32:25,127 --> 01:32:28,926
<i>Vale of Tears four, Black Mischief five,</i>

995
01:32:29,086 --> 01:32:31,286
<i>Whichaway six, Chief Yeoman twelve,</i>

996
01:32:31,447 --> 01:32:33,527
<i>Peerless Pal is 20...</i>

997
01:32:33,687 --> 01:32:36,247
<i>- OK.
...and Mariato is 40.</i>

998
01:32:36,407 --> 01:32:38,527
<i>Here we go for the sixth at Belmont.</i>

999
01:32:38,686 --> 01:32:40,767
<i>Five furlongs, they're at the post...</i>

1000
01:32:40,927 --> 01:32:43,287
- Now.
- Sixth race, Belmont, 15,000...

1001
01:32:43,447 --> 01:32:46,967
We can't take any bets
once the race has started.

1002
01:32:47,127 --> 01:32:49,847
You can bet on another race
if you care to.

1003
01:32:50,007 --> 01:32:52,447
<i>...it's Wrecking Crew by two,</i>

1004
01:32:52,607 --> 01:32:56,447
<i>Whichaway by a half, Black Mischief,
Vale of Tears on the outside...</i>

1005
01:32:56,607 --> 01:32:58,127
Nothing, thank you.

1006
01:32:58,286 --> 01:33:01,846
- What happened?
- I didn't get the bet down in time.

1007
01:33:02,006 --> 01:33:03,407
Jesus!

1008
01:33:03,567 --> 01:33:05,527
<i>...Mariato and Peerless Pal,</i>

1009
01:33:05,686 --> 01:33:08,807
<i>heading for home, Wrecking Crew
all alone by six lengths,</i>

1010
01:33:08,967 --> 01:33:10,926
<i>Whichaway a length, Vale of Tears,</i>

1011
01:33:11,087 --> 01:33:13,526
<i>Wrecking Crew, Whichaway,
Black Mischief.</i>

1012
01:33:13,687 --> 01:33:16,767
<i>At the wire, Wrecking Crew
wins it by six lengths,</i>

1013
01:33:16,927 --> 01:33:20,127
<i>Black Mischief second by a head,
Whichaway third by a neck,</i>

1014
01:33:20,287 --> 01:33:22,807
<i>followed by Vale of Tears.</i>

1015
01:33:22,967 --> 01:33:25,446
Should have had your money
on Wrecking Crew.

1016
01:33:25,607 --> 01:33:28,007
<i>The track is sloppy
at Riverside Park.</i>

1017
01:33:28,167 --> 01:33:33,487
<i>There's a late scratch there,
Transmutate, in the fifth at Riverside.</i>

1018
01:33:33,647 --> 01:33:39,047
<i>At Belmont, the winner Wrecking Crew
paid $6.00, $4.20 and $2.80.</i>

1019
01:33:39,207 --> 01:33:41,967
<i>Black Mischief $4.60 and $3.20.</i>

1020
01:33:46,446 --> 01:33:49,207
I'll have half a million here
by post time tomorrow.

1021
01:33:49,367 --> 01:33:53,247
Lay it on the first race at 4-1 or
better. Make sure I get to the window.

1022
01:33:53,407 --> 01:33:58,246
- How the hell am I gonna do that?
- I don't know. Figure it out, Kelly.

1023
01:34:24,127 --> 01:34:26,567
- Finished?
- Yeah.

1024
01:34:26,727 --> 01:34:29,847
Meat loaf, apple pie
and a cup of coffee.

1025
01:34:35,247 --> 01:34:37,847
- Say, what time do you get off work?
- 2 am.

1026
01:34:38,006 --> 01:34:41,967
- Yeah? Doing anything tonight?
- Yeah. Sleeping.

1027
01:34:43,007 --> 01:34:44,647
Eighty-five.

1028
01:35:01,087 --> 01:35:03,847
- Uh... Got a back door?
- What's wrong with the...

1029
01:35:04,007 --> 01:35:07,486
There's a guy I don't need to see.
Don't look around.

1030
01:35:07,646 --> 01:35:10,447
- What does he want?
- To kill me.

1031
01:35:10,607 --> 01:35:14,206
Do me a favour, go to the bathroom,
open the window and wait there.

1032
01:35:14,366 --> 01:35:17,007
- Why should I...?
- Do what I say and it'll be jake.

1033
01:35:17,167 --> 01:35:18,886
Please.

1034
01:35:25,326 --> 01:35:27,327
Thanks. 'Night.

1035
01:35:59,247 --> 01:36:01,047
It's taken.

1036
01:36:18,607 --> 01:36:20,727
Thanks. See you.

1037
01:36:24,647 --> 01:36:25,847
Shit.

1038
01:37:07,327 --> 01:37:09,367
Salino... Hey, I wasn't...

1039
01:37:33,087 --> 01:37:35,247
Hey! Got you, Hooker!

1040
01:37:36,367 --> 01:37:39,326
- Hey, there, Snyder. Long time no see.
- Get goin'.

1041
01:38:06,527 --> 01:38:08,087
Chuck.

1042
01:38:09,127 --> 01:38:12,287
- Get this off to the department.
- Yes, sir.

1043
01:38:27,886 --> 01:38:31,247
Hello, Hooker... Take them off.

1044
01:38:31,407 --> 01:38:34,167
Special Agent Polk, FBI.

1045
01:38:34,327 --> 01:38:35,767
Have a chair.

1046
01:38:38,767 --> 01:38:40,807
- Do you want a drink of something?
- No.

1047
01:38:42,367 --> 01:38:45,887
We want to talk to you
about Henry Gondorff.

1048
01:38:46,047 --> 01:38:47,967
Yeah? I don't think I know him.

1049
01:38:48,127 --> 01:38:51,687
Give yourself a couple of seconds.
You wouldn't want to lie to me.

1050
01:38:51,847 --> 01:38:54,607
Snyder says you've done
a lot of confidence work.

1051
01:38:54,766 --> 01:38:57,487
Oh, yeah?
Lieutenant Snyder doesn't know shit.

1052
01:38:57,646 --> 01:39:00,207
You ain't got nothin' on me.

1053
01:39:00,367 --> 01:39:02,207
Yeah?

1054
01:39:02,367 --> 01:39:04,727
How about counterfeiting?

1055
01:39:07,167 --> 01:39:11,007
We've got a tip that Gondorff is gonna
run a con on the South Side here.

1056
01:39:11,167 --> 01:39:14,567
All you gotta do is tell us
when he's gonna play his chump.

1057
01:39:14,727 --> 01:39:20,367
We come in at the sting, make the pinch,
and... you walk out, free as a bird.

1058
01:39:20,527 --> 01:39:21,926
No.

1059
01:39:23,367 --> 01:39:28,287
Wanna spend the next 20 years in a
Federal penitentiary, starting tonight?

1060
01:39:28,447 --> 01:39:31,847
- I'll make parole.
- Like hell.

1061
01:39:32,007 --> 01:39:34,887
- You won't even get a review.
- I'll chance it.

1062
01:39:37,727 --> 01:39:41,207
OK. If that's the way you want it.

1063
01:39:41,367 --> 01:39:44,727
We might even provide you
with a little company on your way.

1064
01:39:44,887 --> 01:39:47,887
That wife of Luther Coleman, Snyder.
What was her name?

1065
01:39:48,047 --> 01:39:51,686
- Alva.
- Alva. That's it, Alva Coleman.

1066
01:39:52,687 --> 01:39:55,126
Pretty fair grifter in her time.

1067
01:39:55,287 --> 01:39:58,286
Snyder's given us quite a folder on her.

1068
01:39:58,447 --> 01:40:01,166
Nothing major by itself, but, uh...

1069
01:40:01,327 --> 01:40:04,446
Put 'em all together,
it could add up to a lot of years.

1070
01:40:05,847 --> 01:40:08,007
You stink, mister.

1071
01:40:08,166 --> 01:40:09,806
Don't be a sap.

1072
01:40:09,967 --> 01:40:11,767
It's not her I want.

1073
01:40:13,246 --> 01:40:17,607
You're too dumb to save yourself,
no sense dragging her down with you.

1074
01:40:38,287 --> 01:40:40,367
It's over, Hooker.

1075
01:40:41,727 --> 01:40:44,327
You can save me a lot of trouble.

1076
01:40:44,487 --> 01:40:48,527
But I'm gonna get Henry Gondorff
whether you help me out or not.

1077
01:41:02,886 --> 01:41:06,007
- You'll wait till the chump is played?
- Hell, yes.

1078
01:41:06,166 --> 01:41:07,966
We don't care about the mark.

1079
01:41:08,127 --> 01:41:12,727
I mean completely played. Come in
before we beat him and I'll kill him.

1080
01:41:12,887 --> 01:41:14,887
All right, Hooker.

1081
01:41:15,047 --> 01:41:19,687
But you try to take it on the lam,
and we'll shoot you down on sight.

1082
01:41:26,486 --> 01:41:28,847
As long as I get to finish the play.

1083
01:41:38,607 --> 01:41:42,087
- What is it? You're not saying much.
- Just got the jumps.

1084
01:41:42,246 --> 01:41:44,207
Come in.

1085
01:41:44,367 --> 01:41:47,447
Things are slow,
I wanna open the round for the girls.

1086
01:41:47,606 --> 01:41:48,807
Sure.

1087
01:41:53,607 --> 01:41:55,327
Take it easy, we won't lose him.

1088
01:41:55,487 --> 01:41:58,647
We got him 10 years ago
when he decided to be somebody.

1089
01:41:58,807 --> 01:42:01,807
Believe me, I've seen enough to know.
Ten.

1090
01:42:01,967 --> 01:42:03,526
- 20.
- 30.

1091
01:42:03,687 --> 01:42:05,047
Go.

1092
01:42:05,207 --> 01:42:06,647
31.

1093
01:42:09,847 --> 01:42:11,567
J... Ach!

1094
01:42:11,727 --> 01:42:14,766
How many guys have you conned
in your life, Henry?

1095
01:42:15,367 --> 01:42:18,127
I don't know. Two or three hundred.

1096
01:42:18,287 --> 01:42:22,166
Sometimes we played two a day,
when I was in O'Shea's mob.

1097
01:42:23,007 --> 01:42:26,167
'Course, Chicago was a rigged town.
The fix was in.

1098
01:42:26,327 --> 01:42:29,407
Dicks took their end without a beef.

1099
01:42:29,566 --> 01:42:32,167
We had it down to a business.

1100
01:42:33,406 --> 01:42:35,167
And it really stunk, kid.

1101
01:42:35,326 --> 01:42:38,847
No sense bein' a grifter
if it's the same as being a citizen.

1102
01:42:40,047 --> 01:42:44,687
Well, I got packin' to do. I'm gonna be
a hot number again after tomorrow.

1103
01:42:54,607 --> 01:42:58,007
I wouldn't have asked you to do this
if it weren't for Luther.

1104
01:42:58,167 --> 01:43:02,206
Nothin's gonna make up for Luther.
Revenge is for suckers.

1105
01:43:02,366 --> 01:43:05,487
I've been griftin' 30 years,
I never got any.

1106
01:43:08,287 --> 01:43:10,567
Then why are you doing it?

1107
01:43:10,726 --> 01:43:13,247
Seems worthwhile, doesn't it?

1108
01:43:19,967 --> 01:43:21,686
See you.

1109
01:45:36,087 --> 01:45:37,807
Looks like he missed you.

1110
01:45:37,967 --> 01:45:41,007
Yeah. This time, anyway.

1111
01:45:41,167 --> 01:45:43,007
Goodnight, Mrs Hillard.

1112
01:45:49,727 --> 01:45:53,327
I, uh... was wondering if
you might want to come out for a while,

1113
01:45:53,487 --> 01:45:55,527
maybe have a... drink or something.

1114
01:45:55,687 --> 01:45:58,326
You move right along, don't you?

1115
01:45:58,486 --> 01:46:00,967
Hey, I don't mean nothin' by it.

1116
01:46:01,127 --> 01:46:03,807
I just don't know many regular girls,
is all.

1117
01:46:03,966 --> 01:46:06,207
You expect me to come out,
just like that?

1118
01:46:06,367 --> 01:46:09,767
If I expected something,
I wouldn't be standing in the hall.

1119
01:46:09,927 --> 01:46:12,046
I don't even know you.

1120
01:46:12,207 --> 01:46:14,447
You know me.

1121
01:46:14,607 --> 01:46:16,807
I'm just like you.

1122
01:46:16,967 --> 01:46:20,006
It's two in the morning
and I don't know nobody.

1123
01:46:45,167 --> 01:46:48,126
Come on, Henry. Knock off.

1124
01:46:48,287 --> 01:46:51,447
You've done everything you can.

1125
01:51:10,607 --> 01:51:14,287
<i>- Yeah? Polk.
- This is Hooker. Are you ready?</i>

1126
01:51:14,447 --> 01:51:16,047
Yeah, go ahead.

1127
01:51:16,207 --> 01:51:20,367
All set. There'll be a guy at the door
but nobody's carrying any heaters.

1128
01:51:20,526 --> 01:51:22,567
OK, see you there.

1129
01:52:22,727 --> 01:52:24,567
She was gonna kill you, kid.

1130
01:52:24,726 --> 01:52:28,846
Her name's Loretta Salino. Lonnegan's
people set her up in the diner.

1131
01:52:29,007 --> 01:52:32,247
Come on. Let's get outta here.

1132
01:52:32,406 --> 01:52:34,247
Come on!

1133
01:52:38,726 --> 01:52:40,407
Come on!

1134
01:52:45,727 --> 01:52:48,166
She could have killed me last night.

1135
01:52:48,326 --> 01:52:50,487
Too many people could have seen you.

1136
01:52:50,646 --> 01:52:54,367
She was a professional.
Used to work in the Dutch Schultz mob.

1137
01:52:55,647 --> 01:52:57,887
Who are you?

1138
01:52:58,046 --> 01:53:00,926
Gondorff asked me to look after you.

1139
01:53:10,247 --> 01:53:11,567
Snyder.

1140
01:53:11,727 --> 01:53:15,287
We just got a tip that Gondorff's mark
is some big New York wheel.

1141
01:53:15,447 --> 01:53:19,326
As soon we're inside, get him out fast,
before the reporters show up.

1142
01:53:19,487 --> 01:53:22,487
I don't want any big shots around
to mess this up for me.

1143
01:53:22,647 --> 01:53:24,287
All right, let's go.

1144
01:54:22,806 --> 01:54:24,687
Let's go, guys!

1145
01:54:25,727 --> 01:54:27,766
Flag is up, kid.

1146
01:54:33,847 --> 01:54:36,727
- Any time, JJ.
- Workin' on it.

1147
01:54:47,047 --> 01:54:49,247
Got one, Billie, here we go.

1148
01:55:03,087 --> 01:55:08,167
<i>- Yeah.
- Place it on Lucky Dan, Riverside Park.</i>

1149
01:55:26,886 --> 01:55:29,047
<i>... 1- 11 and 35th seconds.</i>

1150
01:55:29,206 --> 01:55:32,366
<i>They were off at 21.</i>

1151
01:55:32,527 --> 01:55:35,646
<i>Last call on the third
at Riverside Park.</i>

1152
01:55:35,807 --> 01:55:37,807
<i>They're at the post.</i>

1153
01:55:37,967 --> 01:55:40,927
<i>At Havre de Grace,
the winner, Light Chatter,</i>

1154
01:55:41,087 --> 01:55:47,407
<i>paid $5.40, $3.80 and $2.40.
Blacksod...</i>

1155
01:55:47,567 --> 01:55:50,127
$500,000 to win,

1156
01:55:50,287 --> 01:55:53,886
Lucky Dan, third race at Riverside.

1157
01:55:56,007 --> 01:55:58,447
You heard me?

1158
01:55:59,487 --> 01:56:01,166
Hold on, sir.

1159
01:56:01,327 --> 01:56:03,727
I'll get the manager.

1160
01:56:03,887 --> 01:56:08,087
<i>J Stout will ride Flying Cross.
And scratch...</i>

1161
01:56:08,247 --> 01:56:11,647
That guy just bet
half a million dollars on Lucky Dan.

1162
01:56:13,047 --> 01:56:16,647
<i>The winner
at Rockingham Park, Enfin,</i>

1163
01:56:16,806 --> 01:56:21,367
<i>paid $6. 10, $4.30 and $2.50.</i>

1164
01:56:25,687 --> 01:56:27,447
What's your problem?

1165
01:56:27,607 --> 01:56:31,247
Half a million dollars on Lucky Dan
to win, third race at Riverside.

1166
01:56:31,407 --> 01:56:33,727
I can't lay that off in time.

1167
01:56:33,887 --> 01:56:36,927
A bet like that could break us.

1168
01:56:37,087 --> 01:56:42,007
Not only are you a cheat,
you're a gutless cheat as well.

1169
01:56:46,607 --> 01:56:49,487
- What are the odds?
- Four to one.

1170
01:56:52,527 --> 01:56:54,327
Take all of it.

1171
01:57:04,767 --> 01:57:09,167
<i>Arnold Rowe, calling the third race
at Riverside Park, Kansas City.</i>

1172
01:57:09,326 --> 01:57:12,287
<i>The claiming race
for three-year-olds and up.</i>

1173
01:57:12,447 --> 01:57:15,607
<i>It's been raining and
the track is muddy. The flag is up.</i>

1174
01:57:15,767 --> 01:57:18,367
<i>And they're off and running.</i>

1175
01:57:18,526 --> 01:57:21,607
<i>Dr Twink is going to the front,
followed by Lucky Dan,</i>

1176
01:57:21,767 --> 01:57:26,407
<i>lma Dreamer, Orkin, Josie G,
Chi Chi and Little Star.</i>

1177
01:57:26,567 --> 01:57:29,486
<i>Around the clubhouse turn,
it's Lucky Dan ahead,</i>

1178
01:57:29,646 --> 01:57:33,367
<i>Dr Twink a length, Orkin a head,
followed by lma Dreamer,</i>

1179
01:57:33,527 --> 01:57:35,887
<i>Lucky G, Chi Chi and Little Star.</i>

1180
01:57:36,047 --> 01:57:39,407
<i>Into the back stretch,
it's Lucky Dan a length,</i>

1181
01:57:39,567 --> 01:57:41,487
<i>Dr Twink a half, Orkin a head,</i>

1182
01:57:41,647 --> 01:57:43,047
<i>lma Dreamer by one...</i>

1183
01:57:43,206 --> 01:57:46,607
I couldn't wait.
Everything go all right?

1184
01:57:46,767 --> 01:57:49,007
You got nothing to worry about.

1185
01:57:49,167 --> 01:57:54,127
I put it all on Lucky Dan.
Half a million dollars to win.

1186
01:57:55,527 --> 01:57:57,127
To win?

1187
01:57:58,726 --> 01:58:01,767
I said place! Place it on Lucky...!

1188
01:58:01,927 --> 01:58:04,247
That horse is gonna run second!

1189
01:58:04,407 --> 01:58:06,767
<i>...Dr Twink a half and Orkin by two,</i>

1190
01:58:06,927 --> 01:58:10,366
<i>followed by Little Star and Josie G.
And it's a driving finish...</i>

1191
01:58:10,527 --> 01:58:12,607
There's a mistake. Give me my money.

1192
01:58:12,767 --> 01:58:15,647
- I'm sorry...
- There's been a mistake! Give me...!

1193
01:58:15,807 --> 01:58:19,487
All right, everybody, FBI!
Don't anybody try to leave.

1194
01:58:19,647 --> 01:58:23,167
Stand on your feet, hands over
your head, move nice and slow.

1195
01:58:23,327 --> 01:58:24,807
Snyder!

1196
01:58:26,047 --> 01:58:30,406
All right, get 'em up against the wall,
make sure they're not carrying anything.

1197
01:58:33,167 --> 01:58:34,687
Hello, Henry.

1198
01:58:34,847 --> 01:58:38,247
It's been a long time.
But it's over.

1199
01:58:39,446 --> 01:58:41,366
OK, kid. You can go.

1200
01:58:45,567 --> 01:58:47,727
Come on, move 'em back.

1201
01:59:07,566 --> 01:59:09,247
Get him out.

1202
01:59:09,407 --> 01:59:11,167
Get him out!

1203
01:59:11,327 --> 01:59:13,927
Come on! Gotta get you outta here.

1204
01:59:23,687 --> 01:59:26,086
- Come on!
- My money's in there!

1205
01:59:26,247 --> 01:59:28,607
Dead guys, too. You can't get mixed up.

1206
01:59:28,767 --> 01:59:31,527
I got half a million dollars in there!

1207
01:59:41,967 --> 01:59:44,767
He's gone.

1208
01:59:49,686 --> 01:59:52,247
OK, Henry. All clear.

1209
02:00:12,247 --> 02:00:15,967
Nice con, Hickey. Thought you were
the Feds myself when you came in.

1210
02:00:16,127 --> 02:00:19,127
No trouble.
Snyder went for it all the way.

1211
02:00:19,287 --> 02:00:22,887
You should have seen the rag
he lit under Lonnegan!

1212
02:00:27,727 --> 02:00:30,127
Well, kid. You beat him.

1213
02:00:31,207 --> 02:00:33,846
You're right, Henry. It's not enough.

1214
02:00:36,527 --> 02:00:38,327
But it's close.

1215
02:00:41,447 --> 02:00:44,367
OK, guys.
Let's take this place apart fast.

1216
02:00:44,527 --> 02:00:47,566
Pick up your splits
at Boudreau's tonight.

1217
02:00:52,407 --> 02:00:53,927
Nice going, JJ.

1218
02:00:56,847 --> 02:00:58,687
Oh, Henry.

1219
02:01:14,567 --> 02:01:17,287
You're not gonna stick around
for your share?

1220
02:01:18,127 --> 02:01:20,486
Nah. I'd only blow it.

1221
02:02:01,247 --> 02:02:03,527
One, two, one, two, three...
