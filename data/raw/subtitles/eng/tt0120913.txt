1
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:36,328
Once in a great while, mankind unlocks a secret so profound...

2
00:00:36,461 --> 00:00:40,828
that our future
is altered forever.

3
00:00:40,928 --> 00:00:44,062
Fire. Electricity.

4
00:00:44,162 --> 00:00:47,029
Splitting the atom.

5
00:00:47,529 --> 00:00:52,695
At the dawn of the 31st century,
we unlocked another.

6
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:57,729
It had the potential to change
humanity's role in the universe.

7
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:00,963
We called it the Titan project,
and it was a testament...

8
00:01:01,096 --> 00:01:04,163
to the limitless power
of the human imagination.

9
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:07,262
Perhaps that is what
the Drej feared most,

10
00:01:07,362 --> 00:01:12,463
for... it brought them down
upon us without warning...

11
00:01:12,563 --> 00:01:15,396
and... without mercy.

12
00:01:15,496 --> 00:01:20,264
Cale, that day, the day
the Drej descended from the sky,

13
00:01:20,364 --> 00:01:24,265
the only thing that mattered
was keeping you safe.

14
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,129
Perfect !

15
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,264
Hey, stop !
Come on !

16
00:01:54,997 --> 00:01:57,098
- Cale, are you all right ?

17
00:01:57,197 --> 00:02:00,099
I'm okay.

18
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:03,897
Dad,
my invention broke.

19
00:02:03,997 --> 00:02:08,831
Well, then, we'll fix it together,
but not today, Cale. We have to go now.

20
00:02:25,064 --> 00:02:27,597
Dad, where's
everybody going ?

21
00:02:27,697 --> 00:02:32,265
We're leaving too.
We all have to go somewhere safe.

22
00:02:32,365 --> 00:02:38,132
Professor Tucker ! Professor Tucker !
The Drej have reached the global defense system !

23
00:02:38,932 --> 00:02:42,165
Come on, son.
Will we get the people away in time ?

24
00:02:42,297 --> 00:02:45,598
- Not if we sit here talking, sir.
- I wanna drive.

25
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:48,165
- When you're older, kid.
- I'm older than four.

26
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:51,333
- Hang on !

27
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,000
Whoa !

28
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,032
- Please proceed to your designated-
- Is the Titan prepped for launch ?

29
00:03:02,132 --> 00:03:05,732
- Just waiting for you, sir !
- Intelligence says the Drej
don't know the Titan's location,

30
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,566
or we would've
been hit already.

31
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,233
Let's pray
they're right !

32
00:03:13,867 --> 00:03:17,134
Enemy warships
have entered our solar system.

33
00:03:18,234 --> 00:03:19,598
Are we going in that ?

34
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:23,198
- Wow !
- Cale,

35
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,466
I have to go
on a different ship.

36
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:29,367
- I have to go away for a while.

37
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:31,833
No, Dad ! No !

38
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:36,034
- Tek is going to look after you.
- But I wanna go with you !

39
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:39,266
- Sir-
- I know.
It's not safe where I'm going.

40
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:42,600
- Sir ! Professor !
- All right, I'm coming !

41
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:48,534
Cale, here. Take this.
As long as you wear it, there's hope.

42
00:03:48,934 --> 00:03:54,435
- I will see you again. I promise.
- Okay.

43
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:59,134
- No, it's not okay ! It's not okay !

44
00:03:59,234 --> 00:04:02,201
- Tek, keep him safe !
- Daddy !

45
00:04:02,301 --> 00:04:04,735
- Korso, go !
- Come back !

46
00:04:09,502 --> 00:04:14,136
- Evacuate ! Evacuate !
- Godspeed, Sam Tucker !

47
00:04:14,236 --> 00:04:16,633
Attention, pilots. Drej Stingers are-

48
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:19,867
This is Tucker.
Bring me down.

49
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:22,067
Attention, pilots.

50
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:26,335
Drej Stingers are attacking
the escape vehicles.

51
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:33,003
Okay. Are we all here ?
Bobby, buckle up.

52
00:04:40,735 --> 00:04:43,769
- Now, Sam. Now !
- Go, Dad ! Go !

53
00:04:43,868 --> 00:04:46,603
- Get out of there. Get out of there !
- Come on.

54
00:06:58,407 --> 00:07:00,607
# Lose my head to the chemical freeway #

55
00:07:00,707 --> 00:07:05,938
# Comin' up on overload
Losing sure is easy, so I am no more #

56
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:09,439
# But I'm not broken #

57
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:13,072
# In my dream, I win #

58
00:07:13,206 --> 00:07:17,006
# Out here, I'm nothing #

59
00:07:17,106 --> 00:07:20,640
# A cosmic castaway #

60
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,173
# In my head I'm a chemical dreamer
Speed up to the burn out mode #

61
00:07:25,273 --> 00:07:28,606
- # Comin' up to fifth dimension
Beautify, don't crucify me #

62
00:07:28,706 --> 00:07:32,507
- # So I need no mindgame
poisoning my lonely soul #
- Eat this.

63
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,507
- # Losing sure is easy
so I am no more #

64
00:07:35,808 --> 00:07:39,508
- # But I'm not broken #

65
00:07:39,641 --> 00:07:42,773
# In my dream, I win #

66
00:07:42,907 --> 00:07:46,640
- It's lunch. One hour for lunch.
- # And I take over #

67
00:07:46,774 --> 00:07:50,540
# 'Cause I'm no loser #

68
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,874
- # And I'm in and you're not #
- Whoo ! Whoo-hoo !

69
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:58,242
# Bad dreams don't stop #

70
00:07:58,342 --> 00:08:01,873
# But I'm all screwed up #

71
00:08:01,973 --> 00:08:05,640
# A cosmic castaway, yeah #

72
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,407
# A cosmic castaway, yeah #

73
00:08:09,507 --> 00:08:12,375
# A cosmic castaway #

74
00:08:25,108 --> 00:08:26,575
- How ya hittin' 'em, Chowquin ?

75
00:08:26,675 --> 00:08:29,742
- Hey- Chow- Chowquin.
- Wait.

76
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,675
Hey, it's me. It's Cale, all right ?
I'm not with those losers.

77
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:35,575
Humans wait.

78
00:08:35,676 --> 00:08:37,843
- Uppity Earth scum.

79
00:08:40,841 --> 00:08:45,375
- Guess you're stuck with us losers.
- Don't count on it.

80
00:08:45,475 --> 00:08:49,242
- You wait in line, pal.
I'm takin' the express.
- # Cosmic castaway #

81
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:51,843
- # Yeah #
- Go through the docks,
you'll get yourself killed.

82
00:08:52,277 --> 00:08:56,044
Coward. You know, the odds of a ship
docking are a thousand to one.

83
00:08:56,144 --> 00:08:58,975
- # Yeah, a cosmic castaway #

84
00:08:59,144 --> 00:09:00,275
- And that would be the one.

85
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:19,875
Wow.

86
00:09:21,576 --> 00:09:22,776
- Hi.

87
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,243
Mm-hmm.

88
00:09:30,577 --> 00:09:33,045
Hey, wh- Hey !

89
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:36,976
Wow.

90
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:39,676
- We're locked down, Captain.

91
00:09:39,776 --> 00:09:44,244
All right. Keep her hot.
I'll be in touch.

92
00:09:44,844 --> 00:09:47,611
- How you doin' today ? Workin'
hard, are you ? Bon appetit.

93
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:51,145
Next ! Keep the line moving.
Here you go.

94
00:09:51,245 --> 00:09:54,976
- Akrennian Beetle Sushimi.
- You got ketchup ?

95
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,843
Ketchup ? Ketchup ? You don't need
ketchup. Please, next. Move along.

96
00:09:58,943 --> 00:10:02,277
He's a disgrace.
Those dirty humans.

97
00:10:02,377 --> 00:10:04,944
Ketchup ! Boy, some nerve,
human. Nice head, human.

98
00:10:05,044 --> 00:10:09,944
I'm not askin' that much.
I'd just like them to kill my food
before they serve it to me.

99
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:14,510
- You know, I do an honest day's work.
I want already dead food.

100
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,111
- Mm.
- Is that too much for a fellow to ask ?

101
00:10:17,211 --> 00:10:21,212
- Do you hear a crackling sound ?
- And what was up with Chowquin ?

102
00:10:21,812 --> 00:10:25,279
- You should've seen him.
- Ha-ha, not much chance of that.

103
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:29,613
- He was so out of control,
treatin' me like I'm some kind of-
- Human ?

104
00:10:30,246 --> 00:10:32,046
Don't start with
that solidarity thing again.

105
00:10:32,146 --> 00:10:37,311
- If you would study
human history as you've been instructed,

106
00:10:37,411 --> 00:10:42,046
you might realize you're not
alone out there, and you'd be
better prepared for the future.

107
00:10:42,146 --> 00:10:46,347
- Well, I'll tell you somethin'
about your famous future.
- Mmm.

108
00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:51,047
Every day I wake up, it's still the
present, the same grimy, boring present.

109
00:10:51,146 --> 00:10:53,378
I don't think
this future thing exists.

110
00:10:53,978 --> 00:10:57,712
- Do you hear a crackling sound ?

111
00:10:59,812 --> 00:11:00,646
- Here we go.

112
00:11:03,013 --> 00:11:06,046
- We gotta get outta this dump.
- Hold on, everybody ! I got it !

113
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:11,512
Please don't panic.
Just think of it as floating time.
Two seconds. Everybody calm.

114
00:11:14,612 --> 00:11:17,346
Ah. Just needed some love.

115
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,747
Let's get back to eatin' baby.

116
00:11:26,415 --> 00:11:28,914
Okay. Well, I'm full.

117
00:11:31,547 --> 00:11:33,846
Ohh.

118
00:11:48,712 --> 00:11:51,447
- Hey, Cale.

119
00:11:51,947 --> 00:11:56,447
- Firrikash. Po, how's it floatin' ?

120
00:11:57,147 --> 00:12:02,214
- You pulled a nasty stunt back there.
- We don't like your attitude.

121
00:12:03,314 --> 00:12:06,049
- You've been a little uppity.

122
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:10,114
Up-Up- Is that so ? Well.
I'm gonna have to work on that.

123
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:30,148
- You wanna hunt humans, just remember:
We travel in packs.

124
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,915
- What are you doing ?
- It's commonly known as helping.

125
00:12:34,015 --> 00:12:36,316
Yeah ? Well, what for ?

126
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,983
Sometimes, kid, people
just help each other out.

127
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,550
- Oh, right.

128
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:46,115
So you're gonna tell me
you don't want something in return ?

129
00:12:46,214 --> 00:12:51,149
- All right. Maybe I do.
- What a shock.

130
00:12:51,282 --> 00:12:55,682
I want you to risk your life.
I want you to give up everything
you have to join the mission,

131
00:12:55,782 --> 00:13:00,016
where you'll face terror and torture
and possibly gruesome death.

132
00:13:00,116 --> 00:13:03,150
And I would
wanna do that because... ?

133
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:08,182
Because... it's worth it.
Because... the human race needs you.

134
00:13:08,282 --> 00:13:12,683
Maybe you haven't
had a look around lately, but
there aren't many of us left.

135
00:13:12,783 --> 00:13:15,950
At the rate we're going, they'll be
reading about us in textbooks...

136
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:20,251
- and displaying our bones
in alien museums.

137
00:13:21,351 --> 00:13:25,450
- Yeah, well, having your planet
blown up can have that effect on a species.

138
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:30,817
But maybe I've been wrong all
these years, and it took your
inspiring speech to make me see it.

139
00:13:30,917 --> 00:13:34,551
You've really changed me.
It's beautiful.

140
00:13:34,651 --> 00:13:36,584
I think we've gotta hug.

141
00:13:36,684 --> 00:13:41,483
- Oh, man.
They've really ground you down.
- Hey, get this straight.

142
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,383
I don't even know you.
I don't want any part of your mission,

143
00:13:44,483 --> 00:13:48,984
- and I don't need your help
with these oversized morons.

144
00:13:49,283 --> 00:13:51,284
Oh, okay.

145
00:13:55,518 --> 00:13:58,918
- I think he called you morons.

146
00:13:59,018 --> 00:14:02,050
- Whoa !
- Korso.

147
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:06,251
Captain, this is Akima.
We are not alone.

148
00:14:06,351 --> 00:14:09,084
Are we in good company ?

149
00:14:09,984 --> 00:14:11,585
That's a negative,
Captain.

150
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:15,752
I think we've fallen in
with a very bad crowd.

151
00:14:17,552 --> 00:14:20,918
Roger that.
Let's prep for departure.

152
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:27,419
Tek, I need to be scarce
for a while.

153
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:29,552
- You don't know the half of it.
- Ha-ha.

154
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:32,886
Are you still bothering people ?
Hey, go away.

155
00:14:34,353 --> 00:14:38,484
Great job with the kid, Tek.
He's a charmer.

156
00:14:38,584 --> 00:14:41,718
I expected you to take him
off my hands a lot sooner.

157
00:14:41,818 --> 00:14:45,285
- Tek, hey, wait.
Who is this ? You know him ?
- Joseph Korso.

158
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:49,486
- I was with your father
on the Titan project.
- My father.

159
00:14:49,586 --> 00:14:53,453
- I don't have a father.
You brought this guy here ?

160
00:14:54,053 --> 00:14:56,885
- Yes.
- I don't understand. Why ?

161
00:14:57,018 --> 00:14:59,518
You still got that ring
your father gave you ?

162
00:14:59,652 --> 00:15:01,685
- Give it to me.
- Hey, give it back !

163
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:03,852
- Cale-
- Shh.

164
00:15:05,853 --> 00:15:09,253
- Ahh.

165
00:15:09,353 --> 00:15:11,920
Ah. Here.

166
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,586
- Put it on.
- Hmm.

167
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,486
- How did- How did you-
- It's a storage device.

168
00:15:23,587 --> 00:15:27,488
It's genetically encrypted to your
father, and therefore, to you.

169
00:15:27,587 --> 00:15:29,655
It's a map, Cale.

170
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:33,622
It can tell us
where your father hid the Titan.

171
00:15:33,722 --> 00:15:36,986
That's why I've spent
the last 15 years lookin' for ya.

172
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,687
That ship means everything.
Humanity depends on you finding it.

173
00:15:43,787 --> 00:15:46,288
Me ?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

174
00:15:46,388 --> 00:15:49,888
Me ? No, no, no.
I'm not- Tek, listen,

175
00:15:50,988 --> 00:15:52,622
there must
be someone better.

176
00:15:53,422 --> 00:15:56,187
It's time, Cale.
It's time to stop running.

177
00:15:57,887 --> 00:15:59,521
- Well, actually,

178
00:15:59,654 --> 00:16:02,354
I think it's time
to start.

179
00:16:05,322 --> 00:16:08,055
Drej.
What do they want ?

180
00:16:08,189 --> 00:16:12,521
They want you, kid.
Same way I want you, only dead.

181
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:15,821
How do you know
they want me dead ?

182
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:29,656
I'm convinced.

183
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,888
We gotta get
to the kitchen.

184
00:16:35,588 --> 00:16:36,888
- Korso, the gravity drive !

185
00:16:43,122 --> 00:16:45,589
- You ready ?
- Tek, I'll lead you in.

186
00:16:45,723 --> 00:16:49,590
- I'll stay here.
- Tek, you can't.

187
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,188
Take care of the kid.
He's not all grown up yet.

188
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:56,256
- No, no, no, no. You're coming.
- Go, Cale. I'll read about you.

189
00:16:56,956 --> 00:16:59,022
Follow me !

190
00:17:00,857 --> 00:17:03,690
Whoa !

191
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:08,591
- Well, this would be good
if we had any baking to do.

192
00:17:08,724 --> 00:17:11,856
Oh, my food !
You guys are- You're terrible.

193
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:15,589
You're unsanitary.
Ooh, I hope that they catch you,

194
00:17:15,723 --> 00:17:18,457
and I'll testify against you,
and you'll never get out of jail.

195
00:17:18,557 --> 00:17:23,224
- Hey, you'll get
all the ketchup you want.

196
00:17:23,324 --> 00:17:26,458
- Drej ! Ooh, I gotta go now.
- Follow ugly !

197
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:29,889
Oh, great. Yeah, no one would ever
think of looking for us in the vent.

198
00:17:29,989 --> 00:17:31,889
Go !

199
00:17:34,323 --> 00:17:36,558
- Go ! Go !

200
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:44,892
He's the big- I'm not supposed to be here !
Come on ! I'm just a cook !

201
00:17:45,024 --> 00:17:48,957
How do I get out of here ? How do I get
out ? Why is this happening to me ?

202
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:53,158
Stupid- Please- Stupid- No !

203
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:56,191
Hi. They went right down there.
They came into my kitchen and-

204
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:59,492
Bull's-eye.

205
00:18:05,692 --> 00:18:09,157
We gotta
get outta here.

206
00:18:09,257 --> 00:18:11,157
Go !

207
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,592
Go ! Run !

208
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,358
- Over.
- Huh ?

209
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:34,291
- Maybe next time, kid.
- Hey, I can fly it too.

210
00:18:37,391 --> 00:18:38,126
- It won't start.

211
00:18:38,226 --> 00:18:40,826
I got an idea.

212
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:47,192
Give it a shot.
Whoa !

213
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,827
Ow !

214
00:18:57,927 --> 00:19:00,827
- Hang on, kid. I'm comin'.

215
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:17,394
Heads up !

216
00:19:17,694 --> 00:19:20,561
They're
locking down the doors !

217
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:23,393
- Not going forward. Going up.
- Up ?

218
00:19:27,527 --> 00:19:29,926
Move it !

219
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:48,628
- You should brace yourself.
- Uh, yeah. I'm feeling that.

220
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:59,360
Eject. Hey, where's the eject ?
Cale ? Cale ?

221
00:19:59,494 --> 00:20:03,295
This model does
have eject, right ?

222
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:13,730
And you were worried.

223
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:16,229
What do you mean, "were" ?

224
00:20:16,329 --> 00:20:21,394
- Akima, we need a pickup here.
- A little late for that.

225
00:20:21,494 --> 00:20:25,295
- I'm right
above you. Can you get to me ?
- Not enough time.

226
00:20:25,394 --> 00:20:29,262
Not-Not-
Not a lot of time.

227
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,662
- Exhale.
- You gotta be kidding.

228
00:20:31,896 --> 00:20:35,163
- Exhale.
- Oh, no, no, no, no !

229
00:21:14,895 --> 00:21:17,529
# Comeback down to Earth, oh, yeah #

230
00:21:17,629 --> 00:21:22,197
# Comeback down to Earth
Comeback down to Earth #

231
00:21:22,297 --> 00:21:25,864
# Oh, yeah
Comeback down to Earth #

232
00:21:26,564 --> 00:21:28,897
- Is it dead ? Can we eat it ?

233
00:21:28,998 --> 00:21:32,098
No, it's not dead.

234
00:21:32,698 --> 00:21:35,530
Who are you ?
Go away.

235
00:21:35,363 --> 00:21:39,297
- Hey, what's going on ?
- Preed, you're in my light.

236
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:42,731
Ah, such motherly concern
for the subject.

237
00:21:42,831 --> 00:21:47,898
- Why am I naked ?
- Why, you positively glow
with maternal warmth, Akima.

238
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:50,665
It's very fetching.
I must have you.

239
00:21:51,165 --> 00:21:54,597
- In your dreams.
- Akrennians don't dream, remember ?

240
00:21:54,697 --> 00:21:57,331
- They don't bathe much, either.
- I'm still naked here.

241
00:21:57,831 --> 00:22:01,898
I hadn't noticed. Now, hold still, or
you'll lose something really important.

242
00:22:01,998 --> 00:22:06,566
- Hand me the probe.
- The probe ? Uh,
wh-where does the probe go ?

243
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:11,130
You know, I'm really feeling
much better. Aah ! Hey !

244
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,664
This is just great.
Cross half the galaxy,

245
00:22:13,797 --> 00:22:16,697
nearly get our butts
shot off by the Drej,

246
00:22:16,797 --> 00:22:19,432
just so we can
rescue the window washer.

247
00:22:19,532 --> 00:22:23,265
Hey, for your information, I happen
to be humanity's last great hope.

248
00:22:23,365 --> 00:22:26,699
- I weep for the species.
- You're fine.

249
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,598
I mean, I'm the guy with the map here.
This is big medicine, right ?

250
00:22:30,698 --> 00:22:34,364
Big medicine ? Let me see.

251
00:22:34,465 --> 00:22:37,865
This is really it ?
This can save us ?

252
00:22:38,965 --> 00:22:41,766
Huh ? Yeah, I guess.

253
00:22:44,567 --> 00:22:48,267
- Do you know what this means ?

254
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,799
Um, I'm really wanting those pants
right about now.

255
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:54,599
Akima, my pet, if the boy isn't
at death's door,

256
00:22:54,699 --> 00:22:57,700
Korso wants Gune to check the map
so we can set a course.

257
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,401
Do you mind ?
Are we through pawing ?

258
00:23:00,501 --> 00:23:04,401
- This is the Valkyrie,
not a singles bar.
- We're done.

259
00:23:04,501 --> 00:23:08,965
You know,
I never said I was gonna help you guys.
We never even addressed what's in it for me.

260
00:23:10,099 --> 00:23:13,165
- Why, you get to be a hero.
- A hero ? Come on.

261
00:23:13,265 --> 00:23:17,233
I mean, there must be something on the
Titan worth selling or trading or-

262
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:21,867
What ? We're gonna risk our necks
to help a bunch of Drifter Colony bums ?

263
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,466
- Where are my pants ?

264
00:23:26,566 --> 00:23:30,266
- Guess where Akima grew up.
- Drifter Colony ?

265
00:23:30,366 --> 00:23:36,001
- Yes. The boy learns.
- Wait. What's your-

266
00:23:36,101 --> 00:23:41,268
Preed, wait up ! Look.
Where's Korso ? I wanna talk to him.

267
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:45,567
I believe he's in Navigation.
We're headed there now.

268
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:51,868
- You wanna watch
who you're steppin' on.

269
00:23:51,967 --> 00:23:54,268
Or you'll what ?

270
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:59,036
- Ah, the lovely and talented Stith.
This is Cale.

271
00:23:59,136 --> 00:24:02,103
- You remember- Cale.
- No, no, no, no, no. Cannot talk.

272
00:24:02,203 --> 00:24:05,666
We lost targeting on one
of our aft gun turrets again !

273
00:24:05,766 --> 00:24:08,134
What ? Think
this is a pleasure cruise ?

274
00:24:08,234 --> 00:24:13,368
She's a sweet little thing.
Weapons specialist.
Normally, she's very good-natured.

275
00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:17,936
Great !
Things aren't bad enough !

276
00:24:18,036 --> 00:24:21,536
- Tools all over the floor !
- Fight the good fight, precious.

277
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:25,634
Preed, I'll kill you. Okay ?
I will kill you.

278
00:24:25,768 --> 00:24:29,602
I am educated and well-read !
I am not a mechanic !

279
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:34,169
- I have my pride ! - Gune ? Guney ? Are you in there ?

280
00:24:34,302 --> 00:24:37,603
...by the acceleration, multiplied
by the coefficient of the friction...

281
00:24:37,703 --> 00:24:39,670
and apply necessary force.

282
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,735
- Gune ?
- Ooh.

283
00:24:42,835 --> 00:24:45,902
- Look at that.
- Does this look familiar ?
Do you know what it is ?

284
00:24:46,002 --> 00:24:52,470
- Neither do I. I made it
last night in my sleep. Apparently, I used Gindrogac-
highly unstable.

285
00:24:53,003 --> 00:24:56,204
- Gune.
- I put a button on it, yes.

286
00:24:56,337 --> 00:25:00,503
I wish to press it, but I'm not sure
what will happen if I do.

287
00:25:00,935 --> 00:25:05,535
- Let me see, now. Three, five,
twenty-two, seventy-four,

288
00:25:05,635 --> 00:25:07,535
- eleven-

289
00:25:07,636 --> 00:25:10,103
- No. No-no-no-no. Careful.

290
00:25:10,203 --> 00:25:15,204
- It's perfect.
- Ho, yes !

291
00:25:15,304 --> 00:25:18,037
- Hey.
- Perfect ! You fixed it !

292
00:25:18,137 --> 00:25:21,169
- So, where are we now ?

293
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:25,269
We are here, right here-
Bellasan Quadrant.

294
00:25:25,769 --> 00:25:31,204
About three million keks from Tau 14.
Why ? Are you homesick ?

295
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:34,971
- Gotta have a home for that.
- Mmm.

296
00:25:35,071 --> 00:25:38,670
Translucent bipedal
mesomorphic embryonic male.

297
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:42,704
Yes, yes, yes. This is all very
fascinating, but take a look at this.

298
00:25:42,804 --> 00:25:46,304
- It's a map. Can you read it ?
- Can I read it ?

299
00:25:46,404 --> 00:25:49,239
Of course I can read it.
Yes. Hmm.

300
00:25:49,338 --> 00:25:51,805
- So, what do you see ?
- Ah !

301
00:25:51,905 --> 00:25:55,672
- Yes, this is Pl'ochda.

302
00:25:55,772 --> 00:26:00,070
- And this- this-
this is... Solbrecht !

303
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:03,070
And this- And this-
And this- What is this ?

304
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:06,738
- That's, uh- That's lunch.
- What's lunch ?

305
00:26:06,871 --> 00:26:09,571
- Mmm.

306
00:26:09,671 --> 00:26:14,739
Spaghetti derivative, meatballs- sort
of, anyway- and Caldoch droppings.

307
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:19,071
- Who ate it before you did ?
- Hey, hey !

308
00:26:19,171 --> 00:26:21,405
Ahh !

309
00:26:21,505 --> 00:26:25,005
- Tell you a secret. This guy's nuts.
- I'll tell you another.

310
00:26:25,105 --> 00:26:28,272
He's never wrong.
Where are we going, Gune ?

311
00:26:28,372 --> 00:26:33,173
Ahh, the broken moon
of Sesharrim.

312
00:26:33,274 --> 00:26:35,205
Only 13,000 keks away.

313
00:26:35,305 --> 00:26:37,838
- Have Akima lay in a course.
- We're on our way.

314
00:26:50,307 --> 00:26:54,371
- What's on Sesharrim, anyway ?
- The Gauol, an ancient race.

315
00:26:54,471 --> 00:26:57,105
- Great.
- This isn't a joyride, kid.

316
00:26:57,205 --> 00:27:01,373
When the Drej destroyed Earth,
they figured life adrift in space...

317
00:27:01,473 --> 00:27:05,039
would break us down,
wipe us out.

318
00:27:05,639 --> 00:27:09,774
Do you really want
those vile creatures to be right ?

319
00:27:11,841 --> 00:27:16,273
- Just lay down and die ?
- A little late.

320
00:27:16,406 --> 00:27:21,474
About 15 years too late
to save the humans. But it's not
like we didn't have a good run.

321
00:27:21,574 --> 00:27:25,274
It's not about a good run.
It's about our survival.

322
00:27:25,374 --> 00:27:29,908
See, the Titan was truly visionary,
the most advanced ship in the universe.

323
00:27:30,008 --> 00:27:35,306
That ship has the power to reunite
the human race, to give us a home.

324
00:27:36,207 --> 00:27:39,074
And the only way to find it
is in your hand.

325
00:27:39,174 --> 00:27:42,674
So, you're really
counting on me, then ?

326
00:27:42,774 --> 00:27:46,075
- We all are.
- Well,

327
00:27:46,175 --> 00:27:49,142
if I don't like
the way things are going,

328
00:27:49,276 --> 00:27:52,874
I'll show you how much
like my father I really am.

329
00:27:55,706 --> 00:27:57,540
I'll leave.

330
00:28:13,074 --> 00:28:15,708
Ahh, no place to
set down on the island.

331
00:28:15,808 --> 00:28:19,076
Land on that coral reef.

332
00:28:26,943 --> 00:28:30,242
We'll take the sled,
see if we can locate the Gauol.

333
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:33,975
- Preed, you and Gune watch the ship.
- Watch the ship ?

334
00:28:34,075 --> 00:28:37,409
- And keep the engines hot.
- Oh, yes. They'll be nice and toasty.

335
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:41,510
- Hmm.
- I'm not keen on the Drej catching me
with my trousers down.

336
00:28:43,143 --> 00:28:45,877
Welcome to Planet Sesharrim, Cale.

337
00:28:45,977 --> 00:28:48,874
- It stinks.
- Hydrogen trees.

338
00:28:48,975 --> 00:28:52,609
Clip one of those,
and we'll be blown to steaming bits.

339
00:28:53,743 --> 00:28:57,476
Hello ? Anybody here ?

340
00:28:57,576 --> 00:28:59,843
We're looking
for the Gauol.

341
00:28:59,943 --> 00:29:02,977
Now, what exactly
do the Gauol look like ?

342
00:29:03,077 --> 00:29:05,975
Don't know.
They don't get out much.

343
00:29:07,075 --> 00:29:10,676
We have a kid with a map here
that you guys should know about.

344
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,911
I think we know
what happened to the Gauol.

345
00:29:35,078 --> 00:29:37,845
Open fire on five.

346
00:29:37,944 --> 00:29:42,345
- We'll clear a path to the sled.
Everybody ready ?

347
00:29:43,945 --> 00:29:45,276
- One, two-

348
00:29:45,476 --> 00:29:49,211
Wait. No, no.
Stop.

349
00:29:49,311 --> 00:29:53,044
- I think they are the Gauol.

350
00:29:58,278 --> 00:30:01,012
Ahh.

351
00:30:05,744 --> 00:30:06,878
Over here !

352
00:30:06,978 --> 00:30:09,145
Quick little devil.

353
00:30:09,245 --> 00:30:11,845
- Okay, all I have to do is tap
into the central computer,

354
00:30:11,945 --> 00:30:13,945
and we can figure
the departure protocols.

355
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:17,879
- Yes. Making progress.
Yes, I'm making progress.

356
00:30:17,979 --> 00:30:20,480
Huh ? Wait, wait.

357
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,044
- Hmm.

358
00:30:23,144 --> 00:30:26,145
Ooh. Hmm.

359
00:30:48,445 --> 00:30:54,013
The moon, the moon, the moon. Right,
yeah. That's how we knew to come here.

360
00:30:54,813 --> 00:30:57,780
My father made a map
with that moon on it.

361
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,245
Now, why ? Is the ship
hidden there ?

362
00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:07,847
Ohh.

363
00:31:09,313 --> 00:31:12,148
- Oh.

364
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:23,980
Hmm. Ahh.

365
00:31:28,148 --> 00:31:31,348
It must be somewhere
in the Andali Nebula.

366
00:31:33,848 --> 00:31:35,715
We did it, kid.

367
00:31:35,815 --> 00:31:38,980
The Titan is as good
as ours.

368
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,780
He must have been here, standing here.
Right here.

369
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,447
- Who ?
- My father.

370
00:31:50,615 --> 00:31:52,615
Go !

371
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,514
Let's move it !

372
00:32:00,214 --> 00:32:02,515
We've gotta
get to the beach !

373
00:32:35,314 --> 00:32:36,148
- Akima !

374
00:32:53,649 --> 00:32:56,883
- Why aren't they shooting at Cale ?
- They want him alive.

375
00:32:56,983 --> 00:33:00,483
Come on, guys.
Pick it up. Pick it up.

376
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:18,584
Nice catch.

377
00:33:28,385 --> 00:33:30,118
Pull up ! Pull up !

378
00:33:59,652 --> 00:34:02,252
Preed, come in !
Preed, where are you ?

379
00:34:02,352 --> 00:34:04,519
- Hold on !

380
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,884
- Preed, come in !

381
00:34:10,584 --> 00:34:13,785
- Preed !

382
00:34:16,352 --> 00:34:21,119
Preed, Preed, Preed ! Aren't you
supposed to be watching for the Drej ?

383
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:25,187
Yes, caveman, that's right.
Drej bad. We good.

384
00:34:25,286 --> 00:34:28,484
- Now, go look at
something shiny for a while.

385
00:34:28,584 --> 00:34:31,085
- How's this ?

386
00:34:31,218 --> 00:34:34,419
- Well, you'd better look again !

387
00:34:37,286 --> 00:34:38,219
Drej !

388
00:34:38,319 --> 00:34:41,019
- Aah !

389
00:35:02,087 --> 00:35:04,488
Captain, we're on our way.
Where are you ?

390
00:35:04,586 --> 00:35:07,152
We're in the
hydrogen trees being chased by the Drej.

391
00:35:07,452 --> 00:35:09,787
- See if you can spot them, quick !
- Look there !

392
00:35:13,421 --> 00:35:15,554
- Akima !
- Hang on !

393
00:35:24,919 --> 00:35:26,953
Nice move.

394
00:35:31,853 --> 00:35:33,520
Get down !

395
00:35:38,954 --> 00:35:41,422
Come on.
Show yourselves.

396
00:35:43,853 --> 00:35:45,821
- Get down !
- Cale !

397
00:35:48,454 --> 00:35:50,654
- I got 'em.

398
00:35:52,921 --> 00:35:54,888
Whoa !

399
00:35:55,289 --> 00:35:57,889
Preed, look !
There they are !

400
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,787
Oh, no.

401
00:36:04,288 --> 00:36:08,889
- Hang on, Akima !

402
00:36:10,989 --> 00:36:13,489
Don't shoot !

403
00:36:13,622 --> 00:36:16,190
Don't shoot !
They've got Cale !

404
00:36:21,487 --> 00:36:24,787
Gune, calculate their trajectory.
Stith, take weapons.

405
00:36:24,888 --> 00:36:27,822
- Let's get on it, people.
- Oh, nice job covering our butts, Preed.

406
00:36:27,921 --> 00:36:31,189
- You're the weapons expert.
- What were you doing ? Taking a nap ?

407
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:34,923
Enough ! Okay,
the Drej took Cale.

408
00:36:35,023 --> 00:36:37,756
But they are not
gonna get away with it.

409
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:41,022
Well, let's quit running
our collective mouths and go get him.

410
00:36:41,155 --> 00:36:46,489
Our only chance to locate them
is to track Akima. Stith, get on it.

411
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,390
Hmm.

412
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:56,924
They're gonna use you to figure out
where the Titan is.

413
00:36:58,223 --> 00:37:01,856
Probably just blow it up,
too, when they find it.

414
00:37:01,956 --> 00:37:06,790
- Yeah, well, who's to say
it would've worked, anyway ?
- Who's to say it won't ?

415
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:11,291
Maybe Korso will get
to the Titan first.

416
00:37:11,391 --> 00:37:14,191
Why do you care so much
about that thing ?

417
00:37:15,492 --> 00:37:18,156
I was raised
around people.

418
00:37:18,255 --> 00:37:21,756
"Drifter Colony bums",
I believe, is the term.

419
00:37:24,023 --> 00:37:28,857
I barely remember Earth, but the older
ones used to tell us about it...

420
00:37:28,957 --> 00:37:31,991
so it would never
be completely lost.

421
00:37:32,491 --> 00:37:35,890
No matter how hard things got-
and they were hard-

422
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:39,057
those memories
kept us going.

423
00:37:39,157 --> 00:37:42,591
Once, we had a home.

424
00:37:43,991 --> 00:37:47,591
The Titan is our chance
to find one again.

425
00:37:50,925 --> 00:37:53,892
I guess that's how
I ended up here.

426
00:37:53,992 --> 00:37:58,291
What are they afraid of ? So what did
the human race ever do to the Drej ?

427
00:37:58,391 --> 00:38:02,492
- It's not what we did. They're afraid
of what we might become.
- Hmm.

428
00:38:02,592 --> 00:38:05,892
Yeah, well, looks like
we're becoming extinct.

429
00:38:53,926 --> 00:38:57,193
- Cale, you okay ?

430
00:38:59,093 --> 00:39:00,394
- Akima !

431
00:39:04,861 --> 00:39:07,294
Cale !

432
00:40:03,763 --> 00:40:07,494
- Cale !
- No ! Stop !

433
00:40:11,761 --> 00:40:14,428
Leave her alone !

434
00:40:17,295 --> 00:40:18,929
Akima !

435
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:23,663
No !

436
00:40:50,262 --> 00:40:55,230
Akima's signal is
getting stronger. I think it's
coming from the slave cages.

437
00:40:57,397 --> 00:40:59,831
- A Drej pod. What's in it ?
- A human.

438
00:40:59,931 --> 00:41:02,398
- She's mine. I saw her first.

439
00:41:03,499 --> 00:41:04,962
- Pretty.

440
00:41:08,095 --> 00:41:10,396
Ah. All right.

441
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:16,164
- I'll take out the guard.
- Easy, big girl.
This requires cunning and deception.

442
00:41:16,963 --> 00:41:18,564
- Hello.
- Ah.

443
00:41:19,264 --> 00:41:21,664
Uh, I'm an Akrennian trader.

444
00:41:21,764 --> 00:41:26,063
I wonder if we might sneak
a peek at the new shipment
before they go on the market ?

445
00:41:26,563 --> 00:41:29,863
- You're not allowed.
- Traditionally, no.
You're absolutely right.

446
00:41:29,964 --> 00:41:33,464
But you see,
I need a new slave rather badly.

447
00:41:33,598 --> 00:41:36,632
- Stop fidgeting, worm !

448
00:41:36,765 --> 00:41:40,199
And I can't wait till auction.
I have to be on the shuttle.

449
00:41:40,299 --> 00:41:44,231
I have an appointment
to have my ear shaved.
It has to be booked months in advance.

450
00:41:44,364 --> 00:41:48,198
- You see my problem.
- Hmm.

451
00:41:47,898 --> 00:41:51,365
You're lying. He's not a slave,
and you're not traders.

452
00:41:51,465 --> 00:41:53,399
- But-
- He doesn't carry himself
like a slave.

453
00:41:53,499 --> 00:41:56,432
- Look at the way he stands.
Probably ex-military.
- How-

454
00:41:56,533 --> 00:41:59,100
Akrennian traders always threaten before
they ask a favor. It's tradition.

455
00:41:59,999 --> 00:42:02,198
- And your robes are made
out of bedspreads.

456
00:42:02,298 --> 00:42:07,764
- Ah. - Just out of curiosity,
did we have a plan "B" ?

457
00:42:16,399 --> 00:42:19,731
- Hmm. An intelligent guard.
Didn't see that one coming.

458
00:43:03,332 --> 00:43:05,433
Whoa.

459
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:55,000
- This is it.

460
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,301
- Are you in there ?

461
00:44:00,468 --> 00:44:04,669
Well, if it isn't the captain.
What kept you ?

462
00:45:27,705 --> 00:45:32,004
Do you see anything ? It was really
small, like a cocoon or something.

463
00:45:32,137 --> 00:45:34,704
No, no, no.
Nothing like that. No. Mmm.

464
00:45:34,805 --> 00:45:37,505
I do see something.

465
00:45:37,638 --> 00:45:40,705
Oh, no. Just a Drej ship.
Drej !

466
00:45:40,805 --> 00:45:43,605
- What ? Where ?
- I'm on it. I'm on it. I'm on it.

467
00:45:43,705 --> 00:45:46,604
- Korso, we have a problem.
You'd better get up here.

468
00:45:46,704 --> 00:45:49,604
- I'm here. I'm here.
What's the problem ?

469
00:45:49,704 --> 00:45:52,604
- Stith, let's go.
- All right. All right.

470
00:45:53,104 --> 00:45:55,438
- I've locked on to him, sir.
- Gune, look out for his buddy.

471
00:45:55,538 --> 00:45:59,438
- There's only one.
He's all alone. Just one.
- Three, five, twenty-two-

472
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:02,772
- Three, five, twenty-two,
seventy-four, eleven.

473
00:46:03,606 --> 00:46:06,838
- Cale !
- Die, Drej scumball !

474
00:46:06,971 --> 00:46:09,205
Oh, don't-
No, don't shoot. Oh, guys-

475
00:46:09,338 --> 00:46:11,405
- Come on. It's me !
- It's Cale !

476
00:46:11,505 --> 00:46:13,405
- Cale !
- Stith, hold your fire !

477
00:46:16,272 --> 00:46:18,206
- Oops.

478
00:46:18,306 --> 00:46:21,140
Akima,
open the cargo bay.

479
00:46:33,206 --> 00:46:34,406
Cale !

480
00:46:37,874 --> 00:46:42,608
- Ah ! The boy is not dead.
This is cause for happiness.
- Hmm.

481
00:46:43,507 --> 00:46:46,272
So, um- how did you escape ?

482
00:46:46,372 --> 00:46:50,173
- He got lucky.
- You know, we were just
about to rescue you.

483
00:46:50,973 --> 00:46:53,106
- Yeah ? Well, thanks.

484
00:46:53,206 --> 00:46:57,707
- Anytime.
- Look, uh, they copied the map.

485
00:46:57,807 --> 00:47:01,108
- I'm sure they're heading
for the Titan now.

486
00:47:01,207 --> 00:47:04,606
They won't find it.
Stations, people.

487
00:47:05,606 --> 00:47:08,806
Yes. Going, going.

488
00:47:10,574 --> 00:47:12,740
Akima ?

489
00:47:12,874 --> 00:47:16,974
Uh, um, what happened ?
How'd you get back ?

490
00:47:17,074 --> 00:47:20,508
I got picked up with the trash.
Luckily, Korso got there...

491
00:47:20,607 --> 00:47:24,507
before I ended up as a door prize
in some alien freak show.

492
00:47:27,841 --> 00:47:30,142
I guess I owe him one.

493
00:47:30,241 --> 00:47:35,042
You know, we both
got real lucky back there.

494
00:47:35,542 --> 00:47:38,476
- But the next time around-
- Cale.

495
00:47:39,176 --> 00:47:42,141
Come on.
Gune needs a hand.

496
00:47:42,373 --> 00:47:46,574
- Yes, the map is good.
The map is different.

497
00:47:46,674 --> 00:47:49,308
- Yes, the map is clear.

498
00:47:49,441 --> 00:47:53,575
- Yes, it's very, very clear.
- Ooh. Take it easy.

499
00:47:53,675 --> 00:47:57,176
Hmm. This outer marking
is pulsing.

500
00:47:57,276 --> 00:48:02,741
- Ah, the distal Phalangial Meridian.
- Gune, what do you make of it ?

501
00:48:03,142 --> 00:48:06,708
Past outer quadrant.

502
00:48:06,809 --> 00:48:11,909
This is the Ice Rings of Tigrin.
Right here. Hmm.

503
00:48:12,509 --> 00:48:16,243
- Easy to get lost in there.
- Good hiding place.

504
00:48:37,641 --> 00:48:39,875
What ?

505
00:48:41,975 --> 00:48:44,543
- Wakeangels.

506
00:48:44,943 --> 00:48:49,376
They follow ships into deep space,
glide on the energywake.

507
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:53,211
- They're supposed to be good luck.

508
00:48:54,744 --> 00:48:56,742
They're like... ghosts.

509
00:48:56,842 --> 00:48:59,709
Sit down. Why don't
you give 'em a run ?

510
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:03,811
- You sure about that ?
- 'Course I'm sure.

511
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:06,244
Okay.

512
00:49:06,344 --> 00:49:09,578
# It's my time to fly #

513
00:49:09,678 --> 00:49:12,812
# I'm proving ground
tonight #

514
00:49:12,912 --> 00:49:17,743
# I'll try to be the best
that I can #

515
00:49:17,843 --> 00:49:20,944
Yeah. You got it.
Open her up.

516
00:49:21,044 --> 00:49:25,345
- Give these angels something to chase.
- All right.

517
00:49:25,478 --> 00:49:27,478
Try this, guys.

518
00:49:28,879 --> 00:49:31,679
# It's my time to fly #

519
00:49:31,779 --> 00:49:34,777
# My father will be
with me tonight #

520
00:49:34,877 --> 00:49:36,944
# Ooh #

521
00:49:37,044 --> 00:49:41,077
# We're right on target #

522
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:44,211
# It's my time to fly #

523
00:49:44,311 --> 00:49:48,945
# My father will
be with us tonight #

524
00:49:49,045 --> 00:49:51,711
# A chance tonight #

525
00:49:55,111 --> 00:49:57,578
# To victory #

526
00:49:57,711 --> 00:50:00,712
# Dreams become reality #
# Reality #

527
00:50:01,645 --> 00:50:04,679
# It's my time to fly #

528
00:50:04,779 --> 00:50:08,047
# My father will be
with me tonight #

529
00:50:08,147 --> 00:50:13,879
# Ooh, I'm right on target #

530
00:50:13,979 --> 00:50:17,213
# It's my time to fly #

531
00:50:17,312 --> 00:50:20,779
# My father will be
with us tonight #

532
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:26,247
# It's my time to fly #

533
00:50:26,347 --> 00:50:29,547
# My father will be
with me tonight #

534
00:50:29,711 --> 00:50:35,378
# Ooh, we're right on target #

535
00:50:35,979 --> 00:50:39,112
# It's my time to fly #

536
00:50:39,212 --> 00:50:42,247
# My father will be
with me tonight #

537
00:50:42,347 --> 00:50:44,414
# Ooh #

538
00:50:44,513 --> 00:50:47,581
# I'm right on target #

539
00:50:51,963 --> 00:50:55,446
- Thank you.
- I knew you could handle this old bird.

540
00:50:55,546 --> 00:50:58,180
No, I mean-
I mean, thank you for-

541
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:02,380
Thank you for trying to find me.
It's more than my father ever did.

542
00:51:03,014 --> 00:51:06,215
Your father was a great man,
Cale.

543
00:51:08,048 --> 00:51:09,913
- He would've been proud of ya.

544
00:51:10,347 --> 00:51:13,814
- You really think so ?
- Trust me.

545
00:51:15,514 --> 00:51:17,948
Thanks. Thanks.

546
00:51:23,415 --> 00:51:25,749
You know, I-
I miss him.

547
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,581
Me too.

548
00:52:27,282 --> 00:52:29,382
Akima ?

549
00:52:29,982 --> 00:52:35,150
Akima ? Huh ?
Oh, uh, uh, uh, sorry.

550
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:40,818
- In or out ?
- Huh ? Oh, uh, in.

551
00:52:44,382 --> 00:52:49,316
Uh, what's going on ?
Do you know why we stopped ?

552
00:52:49,449 --> 00:52:52,083
Pit stop for the basics.
Drifter Colony's the best place...

553
00:52:52,183 --> 00:52:57,951
to pick up plasmapacks,
fuelcells, frozen burritos.

554
00:52:58,051 --> 00:53:02,116
Listen. I need
to talk to you, and-

555
00:53:03,416 --> 00:53:05,350
Where'd you get all this junk ?

556
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:09,184
Not junk.

557
00:53:10,084 --> 00:53:13,584
Why don't you come with me ?
I'll show you.

558
00:53:18,516 --> 00:53:22,849
So, we're gonna barter this stuff
for more of that Earthjunk ?

559
00:53:23,183 --> 00:53:28,050
Don't you get it, Cale ?
That junk is all that's left
of the place we came from.

560
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:32,218
It reminds us of
all the things we miss.

561
00:53:32,318 --> 00:53:36,718
Mm, miss. Like those frozen burritos
you were talking about.

562
00:53:37,418 --> 00:53:39,551
- At least they don't
jump off your plate.

563
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:42,351
You think this is some game ?
Did you forget the plan ?

564
00:53:42,451 --> 00:53:47,318
I get you the Titan;
I get rich. We had a deal, right ?

565
00:53:47,418 --> 00:53:51,252
- How dare you try
to cut me out like that ?

566
00:53:54,053 --> 00:53:58,951
Yeah ? Do as you please, and
guess what. You'll retrieve nothing.

567
00:53:59,051 --> 00:54:03,486
You don't have the whole map.
The kid's got it. And I've got the kid.

568
00:54:03,586 --> 00:54:06,052
So you keep your drones
off my back,

569
00:54:06,152 --> 00:54:08,920
or so help me,
I'll rip his heart out.

570
00:54:10,186 --> 00:54:12,420
Cale, come on.

571
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,754
Going somewhere ?

572
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:21,585
Look what I've found:
two little birdies itchy to fly.

573
00:54:21,718 --> 00:54:25,153
- How long were they standing there ?
- Long enough.

574
00:54:25,286 --> 00:54:27,720
You lied ?

575
00:54:27,852 --> 00:54:30,620
Everything you said ?
Everything you told me ?

576
00:54:30,653 --> 00:54:34,320
Not everything.
Your father hid his ship,

577
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:38,019
then the Drej killed him,
all because he couldn't face the truth.

578
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:43,920
- Yeah ? What is the truth ?
- That the human race is out of
gas. It's circlin' the drain.

579
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:47,453
It's finished.
The only thing that matters
is grabbin' what you can...

580
00:54:47,553 --> 00:54:50,454
before somebody else
beats you to it.

581
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:52,688
No, I don't believe that !

582
00:54:52,821 --> 00:54:57,787
Then you're even more like
your father than I thought. A fool.

583
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:02,720
- Cale !

584
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:09,489
- Akima, come on !
- Stop them.

585
00:55:15,453 --> 00:55:18,320
Stay on 'em.
I'll lock it down.

586
00:55:22,287 --> 00:55:25,054
- Hurry !
- Go ! Go !

587
00:55:33,153 --> 00:55:36,254
- Akima ! Akima ?

588
00:55:53,188 --> 00:55:57,456
Let's go.
We got a ship to find.

589
00:55:58,056 --> 00:55:59,489
Let's get airborne,
now.

590
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:02,256
- Where's Cale and Akima ?
- They're not coming.

591
00:56:02,356 --> 00:56:04,423
- Why not ?
- Because they're afraid.

592
00:56:04,523 --> 00:56:08,024
Afraid ? What exactly are they afraid of ?

593
00:56:08,157 --> 00:56:13,021
They're afraid of what might happen
if my command was ever questioned.

594
00:56:13,521 --> 00:56:14,221
- Get it ?

595
00:56:14,321 --> 00:56:17,455
- Got it.
- You got a problem with that ?

596
00:56:18,455 --> 00:56:20,255
No.

597
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:26,657
- Why they not say good-bye to Gune ?

598
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:43,324
- Go get a blanket, quickly.
She needs warmth.
- Something to keep her warm.

599
00:56:43,424 --> 00:56:44,824
You, go get a doctor.

600
00:56:44,924 --> 00:56:47,322
- Yeah. Hurry.
- Cover her.

601
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,422
- Yes, yes.
- What did you tell him ?

602
00:56:49,522 --> 00:56:51,756
I asked him
to bring corn liquor.

603
00:56:51,856 --> 00:56:53,890
No. Really,
I don't need it.

604
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:56,658
Ha ! Not for you.
For boy.

605
00:56:56,757 --> 00:56:58,824
- Me ?
- He pass out soon.

606
00:57:00,124 --> 00:57:03,725
- She'll be fine. She just
needs rest. Don't worry.

607
00:57:04,125 --> 00:57:06,056
She'll be fine.

608
00:57:15,091 --> 00:57:16,623
Hey !

609
00:57:23,491 --> 00:57:26,256
It's his favorite thing in the world-

610
00:57:26,357 --> 00:57:28,457
that stupid ball.

611
00:57:28,557 --> 00:57:30,958
It was our dad's
back on Earth.

612
00:57:31,358 --> 00:57:32,958
Every time
he kicks that thing,

613
00:57:33,058 --> 00:57:35,691
my brother thinks
he's in a big grass field.

614
00:57:36,591 --> 00:57:37,859
That's some imagination.

615
00:57:37,959 --> 00:57:43,524
Yeah, well. - There. He had
a little help. See what I mean ?

616
00:57:46,891 --> 00:57:48,992
That's him - our dad.

617
00:57:49,092 --> 00:57:51,492
That's where my brother
got the idea.

618
00:57:52,592 --> 00:57:53,626
Hmm.

619
00:57:53,726 --> 00:57:56,092
Here on the colony,
most people got to shut their eyes...

620
00:57:56,192 --> 00:58:00,027
to see anything other
than rusted spaceship hulls.

621
00:58:00,127 --> 00:58:02,257
Not my brother.

622
00:58:04,791 --> 00:58:06,491
Later.

623
00:58:19,926 --> 00:58:23,559
- Hey. Sleeping Beauty.
- How long was I out ?

624
00:58:23,692 --> 00:58:26,526
Not long.
A few hours.

625
00:58:27,326 --> 00:58:30,460
Korso and Preed. I can't believe it.

626
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:33,760
How long before
they reach the Titan ?

627
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:38,194
They won't.
We're gonna beat them to it.

628
00:58:38,294 --> 00:58:41,359
Akima, we're gonna
stop them.

629
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:45,859
Was I seriously injured
back there or something,

630
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:49,260
'cause, funny, I thought you just said
we're gonna stop them ?

631
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:54,027
- That's right.
- Cale, we're in the middle of nowhere.

632
00:58:54,107 --> 00:58:58,561
There's just the two of us,
and, oh, yeah - we don't have a ship.

633
00:58:58,662 --> 00:59:01,093
- Oh, we've got a ship.
- Really ?

634
00:59:01,193 --> 00:59:03,893
- Mm-hmm.
- I'd like to see this... ship.

635
00:59:03,993 --> 00:59:06,393
Check it out.

636
00:59:06,994 --> 00:59:11,060
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes!

637
00:59:15,495 --> 00:59:19,493
Well, she's been a great house,
but I don't think she'll fly.

638
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:26,561
Well, she's still got her ionic
vacuum drive. Those never drain.

639
00:59:26,694 --> 00:59:29,928
- This thing's a wreck.
- I can fix it, but do you think-

640
00:59:30,028 --> 00:59:32,028
Don't worry.
I can fly it.

641
00:59:32,129 --> 00:59:34,929
Good, 'cause
we launch yesterday.

642
00:59:36,529 --> 00:59:39,095
# I've gotta get away from here #

643
00:59:39,695 --> 00:59:42,828
# It couldn't be too soon #

644
00:59:43,928 --> 00:59:46,828
# 'Cause I've seen the stars
for you and me #

645
00:59:47,229 --> 00:59:51,530
# Like rockets
to the moon #

646
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:56,093
# You take me everywhere
that I've never been #

647
00:59:56,627 --> 01:00:01,728
# Show me the meaning
of what life had to give #

648
01:00:01,762 --> 01:00:04,595
# I don't know
what to say #

649
01:00:04,695 --> 01:00:10,296
# I think that maybe
I'm in over my head #

650
01:00:10,396 --> 01:00:15,195
# Stuck in the bed
somethin' she said #
- Ow !

651
01:00:15,295 --> 01:00:20,462
# Makes me think
that I'm in over my head #

652
01:00:20,562 --> 01:00:22,796
# Over my head #

653
01:00:22,896 --> 01:00:25,796
T-minus ten, nine,

654
01:00:25,896 --> 01:00:28,830
eight, seven,

655
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:30,897
- six, five,
- Well, we're good to go.

656
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:34,329
- four, three,
- Let's hope she starts.

657
01:00:34,429 --> 01:00:36,329
- two,
- Oh, she'll start.

658
01:00:36,429 --> 01:00:39,663
- one, zero.
- Yeah, right.

659
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:48,665
- She'll start.

660
01:00:48,765 --> 01:00:51,499
Uh, I'd lean back
if I were you.

661
01:00:53,998 --> 01:00:56,096
- Should I get out and push ?

662
01:01:06,731 --> 01:01:11,297
- Told ya.
- Okay. You did your job.
Now let me do mine.

663
01:01:37,632 --> 01:01:40,198
These collisions keep slowing us down.

664
01:01:40,299 --> 01:01:45,033
- So where is it ?
- My scanners are picking up
a veritable cornucopia of... nothing.

665
01:01:45,133 --> 01:01:48,930
Just find it !
Gune, are you sure about that map ?

666
01:01:49,031 --> 01:01:53,031
You give me map. I follow map.
What more can Gune do ?

667
01:01:53,131 --> 01:01:57,898
- If Professor Screwloose over there
led us off course, I'm going to-
- Hold it !

668
01:01:57,998 --> 01:01:59,832
- What is it ?
- A ship. Three keks east.

669
01:01:59,932 --> 01:02:04,032
- Drej ?
- No. Human craft, heading
for the break zone. Moving fast.

670
01:02:04,132 --> 01:02:06,867
- How fast ?
- I'd say recklessly fast.

671
01:02:07,467 --> 01:02:09,931
- Akima.
- Ah, good !

672
01:02:10,031 --> 01:02:12,866
Akima. Cale.
I- I hail on communicator.

673
01:02:12,998 --> 01:02:14,999
No hailing.
Just follow them.

674
01:02:15,099 --> 01:02:19,033
Okay. I follow, but I plot
new route through safer quadrant.

675
01:02:19,766 --> 01:02:22,400
- If we-

676
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,900
- We're going to follow them,

677
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:28,766
and we'll run silent.

678
01:02:37,401 --> 01:02:40,067
The reflections
are throwing my readings off.

679
01:02:43,034 --> 01:02:46,065
Uh, Akima, I think
we're getting closer.

680
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:52,800
- Cale ! It's Korso.
- Huh ?

681
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:55,034
- He's right behind us.
- What ?

682
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:02,734
We've got to lose him.

683
01:03:12,734 --> 01:03:17,202
- We'll never find them in there.
- We're going in.

684
01:03:21,635 --> 01:03:24,800
- Stith, where are they ?
- I can't get a reading.

685
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:29,101
There's too much ice,
too much interference, Captain.

686
01:03:31,602 --> 01:03:34,101
- Captain.
- Whoa !

687
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:02,868
A heat signature.
I see them !

688
01:04:02,968 --> 01:04:04,935
- Where are they ?
- Behind us !

689
01:04:23,336 --> 01:04:25,803
- No !

690
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:35,805
Where is he ?

691
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:37,938
I- I don't know.

692
01:04:44,636 --> 01:04:48,703
- What ?
- Well, we found them, Captain.

693
01:04:48,803 --> 01:04:51,270
No more heat readings.
All gone.

694
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:56,137
Until they make their move,
we stay here.

695
01:05:12,038 --> 01:05:16,105
- They're moving out, I think.
- Now we've got 'em.

696
01:05:26,138 --> 01:05:30,772
- I can't move. They'll see us.
- Maybe that's exactly what we want.

697
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:38,437
A reading !
Yeah. They're right in front of us.

698
01:05:38,571 --> 01:05:41,438
You're not gonna
get past me, kid.

699
01:05:41,538 --> 01:05:45,271
- There, Captain !
- That's right, Cale. Keep coming.

700
01:05:45,371 --> 01:05:47,705
Closer.
They're getting closer !

701
01:05:48,005 --> 01:05:50,339
There she is, Captain.

702
01:05:52,506 --> 01:05:55,104
No. There, Captain.

703
01:05:56,171 --> 01:05:58,838
Which one ?

704
01:06:12,341 --> 01:06:14,972
Look !
They're behind us now !

705
01:06:21,906 --> 01:06:24,206
- Ready lasers !
- I'm on it !

706
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:31,208
I need one clear shot.
Don't lose 'em.

707
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,874
- Ice ! Turn back !
- No way.

708
01:07:02,974 --> 01:07:06,141
- We'll never make it through.
- We don't have a choice.

709
01:07:07,242 --> 01:07:10,206
- Akima ! Uh-
- Yes, Cale ?

710
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:12,807
- Pull up !
- Shut up !

711
01:07:26,076 --> 01:07:27,909
Let's not
do that again.

712
01:07:35,675 --> 01:07:38,075
Hold it.
Look there.

713
01:07:45,343 --> 01:07:47,508
Akima, turn around.
Turn around !

714
01:08:24,998 --> 01:08:26,941
That's it.

715
01:08:31,109 --> 01:08:35,810
Wow. Have you ever
seen anything like it ?

716
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:39,276
Once.

717
01:08:58,145 --> 01:09:03,210
- What exactly are we looking for ?
- This ship's gonna
help us save mankind.

718
01:09:03,309 --> 01:09:07,478
- What exactly are we looking for ?
- Not a clue.

719
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:10,478
DNA coding.

720
01:09:10,578 --> 01:09:14,245
"Mammal.
Tursiops truncatus."

721
01:09:14,345 --> 01:09:16,479
The bottle-nosed dolphin.

722
01:09:16,579 --> 01:09:19,813
These are animals-
or- or they will be.

723
01:09:22,843 --> 01:09:26,877
"Leopard.
Papilio glaucus."

724
01:09:27,611 --> 01:09:30,744
Swallowtail butterfly.
It's all here.

725
01:09:32,278 --> 01:09:35,845
- Cale ?
- I'm over here !

726
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:41,177
Look at this.

727
01:09:45,244 --> 01:09:47,444
Dad.

728
01:09:57,013 --> 01:10:00,245
I could never have done anything
like this when I was your age.

729
01:10:00,378 --> 01:10:03,046
- I wonder who you take after ?

730
01:10:27,846 --> 01:10:29,913
Hey.

731
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:46,647
- The Titan. Quick.
- Ready to go, Captain.

732
01:10:46,747 --> 01:10:49,781
You two stay here.
Preed and I can wrap this up.

733
01:10:49,881 --> 01:10:54,248
- But- Here. Hold on to this
in case there's any trouble.

734
01:10:54,348 --> 01:10:57,746
Hmm.
N-N-N-N-No.

735
01:10:57,846 --> 01:11:00,214
Those two are
becoming a problem.

736
01:11:00,747 --> 01:11:03,314
- We need to take care of it.

737
01:11:03,448 --> 01:11:05,981
I'm one step
ahead of you.

738
01:11:07,948 --> 01:11:12,715
- Watch the ship.
I always watch the ship.
- No, this just doesn't feel right.

739
01:11:12,816 --> 01:11:15,679
- I wanna go ! I wanna go !
- Captain said stay.

740
01:11:15,779 --> 01:11:18,613
It's Captain I don't trust.

741
01:11:18,713 --> 01:11:22,114
Hmm. You know,
you may be right. Come on.

742
01:11:23,914 --> 01:11:24,648
- Stith here.

743
01:11:24,748 --> 01:11:28,649
- Stith,
is Gune right there with you ?
- Yeah.

744
01:11:28,748 --> 01:11:32,348
- Then please tell him good-bye
for me, won't you ?
- What ?

745
01:11:34,949 --> 01:11:35,548
- Gune !

746
01:11:35,647 --> 01:11:39,547
- I knew it ! I knew it ! - Get out of there !

747
01:11:56,015 --> 01:12:02,283
- Cale. If this message has-
- Dad ?

748
01:12:02,383 --> 01:12:05,550
If this message has been activated,
then I have died before finding you.

749
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:08,751
I hope
you can forgive me...

750
01:12:08,851 --> 01:12:11,781
for breaking my promise
to see you again.

751
01:12:11,815 --> 01:12:14,515
What I wouldn't give
to see you now.

752
01:12:14,615 --> 01:12:19,649
I can't change the past, Cale,
but I hope I can give you a future.

753
01:12:21,016 --> 01:12:25,649
This ship has the power
to create a planet,

754
01:12:25,749 --> 01:12:28,850
to create a new home.

755
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:32,849
Your ring would have activated
the transformation sequence,

756
01:12:32,949 --> 01:12:36,216
but the Titan's power cells
were drained in the escape.

757
01:12:36,316 --> 01:12:41,016
They are unable
to fuel the transformation.

758
01:12:41,150 --> 01:12:44,184
It is up to you
to restore their power.

759
01:12:44,618 --> 01:12:47,418
After that,
the procedure is simple.

760
01:12:49,052 --> 01:12:51,483
- He always did talk too much.

761
01:12:53,050 --> 01:12:55,717
- Oh !
- Ah-Ah-Ah.

762
01:12:57,051 --> 01:13:01,785
Korso, don't do this.
This ship is all we have left.
Doesn't that mean anything to you ?

763
01:13:01,885 --> 01:13:04,552
Sorry, kid.
World blowing up changes a man.

764
01:13:04,652 --> 01:13:07,816
- Look. The Drej-
- See, you can't beat the Drej.

765
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:10,216
No one can.
They're pure energy.

766
01:13:10,916 --> 01:13:14,317
Face it, Cale.
You've lost.

767
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:18,384
- Actually, you all have.

768
01:13:18,217 --> 01:13:21,418
Captain, if you'll relieve yourself
of your firearm-

769
01:13:22,918 --> 01:13:25,451
- You backstabbing-
- Well, I learned from the best.

770
01:13:25,885 --> 01:13:29,251
But it wasn't just the money
the Drej were offering.

771
01:13:29,551 --> 01:13:31,917
It was the health plan
that came with it.

772
01:13:32,317 --> 01:13:37,185
They'd let me live provided
I kill all of you before they get here.

773
01:13:38,786 --> 01:13:41,086
They should be here shortly.

774
01:13:52,453 --> 01:13:56,152
- Gune ? Gune ?

775
01:13:56,486 --> 01:13:59,620
- Gune !

776
01:14:01,987 --> 01:14:06,185
- Gune, are you all right ?
- I'm- I'm all right f-for business.

777
01:14:06,285 --> 01:14:10,386
- Gune.
- I'll just take a little nap...

778
01:14:10,486 --> 01:14:16,219
since I'm so- very sleepy.

779
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:19,019
Ahh.

780
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:21,921
- Preed, you can't trust the Drej.
- Akima.

781
01:14:22,053 --> 01:14:26,886
Oh, stop ! There's nothing more
tiresome than last-minute heroics !

782
01:14:43,553 --> 01:14:47,154
- Captain ? Mm. Oh.

783
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:54,155
- Hide 'n' seek, is it ?
Or should we play...

784
01:14:54,255 --> 01:14:56,155
search and destroy !

785
01:14:56,255 --> 01:14:58,755
- Preed !
- Ah !

786
01:15:10,287 --> 01:15:14,355
- Give me the ring.
- Aw. You're not gonna shoot me, kid.

787
01:15:36,489 --> 01:15:40,121
- Cale !
- Ah. Aah !

788
01:15:44,588 --> 01:15:47,956
Hold on !
Oh !

789
01:15:48,255 --> 01:15:51,289
You can let go, kid.
I wouldn't blame you.

790
01:15:51,389 --> 01:15:54,656
No ! I'm not
gonna let go !

791
01:15:59,454 --> 01:16:02,488
- Korso !

792
01:16:07,056 --> 01:16:09,055
- Cale ! The Drej !

793
01:16:16,524 --> 01:16:18,222
- You okay ?

794
01:16:18,922 --> 01:16:21,189
- Yeah.

795
01:16:35,391 --> 01:16:38,123
- Let's not panic.
- We've gotta get out of here
before the Drej arrive.

796
01:16:38,256 --> 01:16:42,823
- No, I think we're gonna stay right here.
- Right here is about to be blown apart.

797
01:16:42,923 --> 01:16:45,158
- This could be a good thing. Wait.
- Come on, Cale !

798
01:16:45,258 --> 01:16:47,625
Wait.
We can make this work.

799
01:16:49,792 --> 01:16:53,025
- What did Korso say about the Drej ?
- That you can't beat them.

800
01:16:53,125 --> 01:16:55,823
Right !
Because they're pure energy.

801
01:16:55,923 --> 01:17:01,023
If I can reroute the system to use Drej
energy, that would start the reactor.

802
01:17:03,224 --> 01:17:08,158
The energy relays are linked to these
circuit breakers, so this should do it.

803
01:17:10,758 --> 01:17:14,523
- Yes !
- Are you sure this will work ?

804
01:17:18,191 --> 01:17:20,125
Come on !
I can fix this !

805
01:17:20,225 --> 01:17:23,658
I need to get outside.
Can you and Stith cover me ?
I- I just need a little time.

806
01:17:23,758 --> 01:17:26,659
- How much time ?
- Uh, a few hours !

807
01:17:26,759 --> 01:17:29,559
What can you do
in a few minutes ?

808
01:17:42,459 --> 01:17:45,526
- Here they come.
- Not if I can help it.

809
01:17:53,458 --> 01:17:56,291
- Cale, you're
a sitting duck up there.
- I'm all right.

810
01:18:05,859 --> 01:18:08,027
- Oh !
- Come on !

811
01:18:11,858 --> 01:18:15,026
Whoo !

812
01:18:15,059 --> 01:18:19,460
- Oh, fantastic.
I only have two guns left.
- Let's make 'em count.

813
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:22,860
- Akima, I can't shake 'em.
- I've got him.

814
01:18:31,659 --> 01:18:33,493
Ah ! I'm out !

815
01:18:35,893 --> 01:18:39,060
Let's do this ! Whoo !

816
01:18:43,194 --> 01:18:48,559
- Well, guys, it's been fun.
- A little help here, Akima. Whoa !

817
01:18:50,826 --> 01:18:54,460
- Cale !

818
01:18:54,594 --> 01:18:58,027
I finished my nap !

819
01:19:00,394 --> 01:19:04,395
- Gune !
- Who's your daddy ?

820
01:19:04,495 --> 01:19:07,094
Gune's your daddy !

821
01:19:09,427 --> 01:19:11,994
Oh, no ! No, no, no, no !

822
01:19:12,094 --> 01:19:15,161
Oh !

823
01:19:15,461 --> 01:19:19,428
- Cale, are you all right ?
- I'm pinned.

824
01:19:19,529 --> 01:19:22,329
- Stith, who's outside with Cale ?

825
01:19:23,562 --> 01:19:25,928
- Hi, kid.
- It's Korso !

826
01:19:28,861 --> 01:19:31,028
You'll never get a cleaner shot, Korso.

827
01:19:39,963 --> 01:19:43,030
Maybe we can beat 'em
after all.

828
01:19:46,028 --> 01:19:48,294
Go ahead.
I'll cover you.

829
01:19:48,594 --> 01:19:52,628
Yeah, yeah. Right.

830
01:20:06,529 --> 01:20:08,829
Okay.

831
01:20:10,929 --> 01:20:12,429
- Oh, great.

832
01:20:15,496 --> 01:20:18,997
- Fry, Drej !
- Ah !

833
01:20:25,162 --> 01:20:26,996
They're leaving.

834
01:20:30,697 --> 01:20:34,131
Uh-oh.
We got a problem.

835
01:20:37,398 --> 01:20:39,865
Go. They're
joining the mother ship.

836
01:20:39,965 --> 01:20:42,695
- But the breaker !
- Cale, she's preparing to fire !

837
01:20:43,195 --> 01:20:46,563
- You can't stay out here.
- I'll take care of it, so let's move.

838
01:20:51,064 --> 01:20:52,931
Go on. Get out of here.

839
01:20:53,031 --> 01:20:55,597
Cale, where are you ?

840
01:20:55,698 --> 01:20:58,364
Go. It's better this way.

841
01:20:58,464 --> 01:21:00,863
Uh-

842
01:21:17,532 --> 01:21:20,331
Here they come again.

843
01:21:32,166 --> 01:21:35,066
Come on.
Faster. Faster.

844
01:21:38,966 --> 01:21:39,564
Come on.

845
01:24:37,670 --> 01:24:39,471
This is amazing.

846
01:24:43,171 --> 01:24:45,538
I know.

847
01:24:45,938 --> 01:24:48,036
What are
you going to call it ?

848
01:24:48,136 --> 01:24:51,804
I think
I'll call it... Bob.

849
01:24:52,204 --> 01:24:55,370
- Bob ?
- You don't like "Bob" ?

850
01:24:55,470 --> 01:24:57,471
You can't
call a planet "Bob".

851
01:24:57,571 --> 01:25:01,038
Oh, so now you're the boss.
You're the king of Bob.

852
01:25:01,172 --> 01:25:04,072
- Well, no, but-
- What ?

853
01:25:04,172 --> 01:25:06,070
Can't you just
call it Earth ?

854
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:11,237
Well, no one said
you had to live on Bob.

855
01:25:11,338 --> 01:25:13,905
I'm never...

856
01:25:14,205 --> 01:25:16,405
calling it that.

857
01:26:46,007 --> 01:26:48,107
# Ohh, oh, oh #

858
01:26:48,907 --> 01:26:51,508
# Ohh, oh, oh, oh #

859
01:26:51,608 --> 01:26:54,275
# Ohh, oh, oh #

860
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:56,275
# Ohh, oh, oh, oh #

861
01:26:56,375 --> 01:26:59,273
# Take the path
of least resistance #

862
01:26:59,373 --> 01:27:02,174
# Into the great unknown #

863
01:27:02,274 --> 01:27:06,574
# No directory assistance #

864
01:27:06,674 --> 01:27:10,608
# Now you're on your own #

865
01:27:10,708 --> 01:27:13,909
# But if you're looking
for a new world #

866
01:27:15,176 --> 01:27:20,607
# Just open up your eyes #

867
01:27:20,707 --> 01:27:26,641
- # Because it's not quite paradise #
- # No #

868
01:27:26,741 --> 01:27:28,975
# But it sure feels like home #

869
01:27:29,075 --> 01:27:32,242
# Not quite paradise #

870
01:27:32,342 --> 01:27:36,408
# And we can rent to own #

871
01:27:36,508 --> 01:27:39,041
# It'll be all right #

872
01:27:39,141 --> 01:27:44,742
# No, it's not quite #

873
01:27:45,276 --> 01:27:49,910
# Paradise #

874
01:27:51,043 --> 01:27:53,377
# Tomorrow's an illusion #

875
01:27:53,777 --> 01:27:56,442
# And yesterday's a dream #

876
01:27:56,542 --> 01:28:00,576
# Today is absolution #

877
01:28:00,676 --> 01:28:04,610
# But you gotta let it be #

878
01:28:04,710 --> 01:28:08,111
# And if you're looking
for the answer #

879
01:28:09,444 --> 01:28:14,942
# It's right before your eyes #

880
01:28:15,075 --> 01:28:20,976
- # Although it's not quite paradise #
- # No, oh, no, oh #

881
01:28:21,076 --> 01:28:23,043
# But it sure looks like home #

882
01:28:23,076 --> 01:28:26,577
# Not quite paradise #

883
01:28:26,677 --> 01:28:30,577
# And we are not alone #

884
01:28:30,677 --> 01:28:33,676
# It'll be all right #

885
01:28:33,776 --> 01:28:39,244
# No, it's not quite #

886
01:28:39,543 --> 01:28:45,010
# Paradise #

887
01:28:45,111 --> 01:28:47,611
# Somewhere
from the edge of time #

888
01:28:47,711 --> 01:28:50,678
# When the poets gather
words don't rhyme #

889
01:28:50,778 --> 01:28:53,410
# I'll call you up and say #

890
01:28:53,543 --> 01:28:56,577
# We made it okay #

891
01:28:56,710 --> 01:28:59,078
# Somewhere
in the back of your mind #

892
01:28:59,178 --> 01:29:01,944
# When you see your demons
come to life #

893
01:29:02,045 --> 01:29:04,779
# And the world
just fades away #

894
01:29:04,878 --> 01:29:08,479
# You know it's okay #

895
01:29:11,677 --> 01:29:13,810
# Ohh, oh, oh #

896
01:29:14,610 --> 01:29:17,244
- # Ohh, oh, oh, oh #
- # It's gonna be okay #

897
01:29:17,344 --> 01:29:19,978
# Ohh, oh, oh #

898
01:29:20,078 --> 01:29:22,212
# Ohh, oh, oh, oh #

899
01:29:22,512 --> 01:29:26,012
- # Okay #
- # Oh, oh, oh #

900
01:29:26,145 --> 01:29:28,045
# Oh, oh, oh, oh #

901
01:29:28,145 --> 01:29:31,277
- # Okay #
- # Oh, oh, oh #

902
01:29:31,611 --> 01:29:33,011
# Oh, oh, oh, oh #

903
01:29:33,111 --> 01:29:38,146
- # But it's not quite paradise #
- # Oh, no #

904
01:29:38,246 --> 01:29:40,313
# But it sure feels like home #

905
01:29:40,413 --> 01:29:42,912
# Not quite paradise #

906
01:29:43,713 --> 01:29:45,180
# We'll make this place
our own #

907
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:49,578
# Not quite paradise #

908
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:51,779
# We can rent to own #

909
01:29:51,879 --> 01:29:54,913
# Not quite paradise #

910
01:29:55,013 --> 01:29:56,613
# We don't have to be alone #

911
01:29:56,713 --> 01:30:02,546
- # Not quite paradise #
- # No, no #

912
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:07,114
- # No, no, no, no #
- # Not quite paradise #

913
01:30:07,214 --> 01:30:12,512
- # No, no, yeah #
- # Not quite paradise #

914
01:30:30,513 --> 01:30:33,113
# Now we've traveled far #

915
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:37,581
# But are we any nearer #

916
01:30:37,681 --> 01:30:41,248
# There's a feelin'
we're reaching for #

917
01:30:41,347 --> 01:30:44,581
# In the fields
where it all began #

918
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:48,214
# Listen, do you hear #

919
01:30:49,347 --> 01:30:52,448
# I thought I heard a promise #

920
01:30:52,548 --> 01:30:56,181
# But that empty feeling grows #

921
01:30:56,281 --> 01:30:59,916
# And I'm scared
that I will forget #

922
01:31:00,316 --> 01:31:02,515
# But I #

923
01:31:03,316 --> 01:31:06,580
# I can remember #

924
01:31:07,780 --> 01:31:10,747
# Look around and around #

925
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:14,048
# There's people
still hanging on #

926
01:31:15,615 --> 01:31:19,182
# See, it's me
I'm the one #

927
01:31:19,282 --> 01:31:23,114
# Believe in me
I've just begun #

928
01:31:23,214 --> 01:31:26,614
# We'll be here
when the lights come on #

929
01:31:26,714 --> 01:31:29,282
# When it all comes down #

930
01:31:29,582 --> 01:31:32,715
# to me and you #

931
01:31:34,382 --> 01:31:36,883
# Just a boy and girl #

932
01:31:38,082 --> 01:31:41,116
# Trying to
change a cold world #

933
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:44,882
# I don't expect
that you'd understand #

934
01:31:45,282 --> 01:31:48,316
# When you look
at this empty land #

935
01:31:49,016 --> 01:31:51,883
# But I #

936
01:31:52,016 --> 01:31:56,417
