1
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:57,656
Once in a while when I wake up

2
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:01,413
I find myself crying.

3
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:05,664
I can never recall
the dream I must have had.

4
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:07,285
But...

5
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,500
But...

6
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:11,704
The sensation that I've lost something

7
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:15,080
lingers for a long time after I wake up.

8
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:25,374
I'm always searching

9
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:28,040
for something, for someone.

10
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:33,620
This feeling has possessed me,
I think, from that day...

11
00:01:34,417 --> 00:01:37,955
That day when the stars came falling.

12
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:39,498
It was almost as if...

13
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:42,780
As if it were a scene from a dream.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,742
Nothing more, nothing less

15
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:48,370
than a beautiful view.
Than a beautiful view.

16
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:53,907
How I wish our words travel

17
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:59,495
till the edge of the world

18
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:04,372
without vanishing

19
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:10,158
then what will those words be?

20
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:17,201
To make promises that won't fade
let's say it on the count of three

21
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:30,416
"Your wish may come true
to some degrees”

22
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:35,198
I no longer cannot see
the eyes of this saying

23
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:37,999
since when and why? I don't know

24
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:43,828
where the point rain starts and ends,
where the rainbow begins and ends

25
00:02:44,042 --> 00:02:45,998
place where my life fades,

26
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:50,030
I've always believed that there is
something I've been chasing

27
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:59,411
one day we'll go
where all living creatures have never been,

28
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:04,164
unprecedented, unexplored sentiments
give them five and kiss your time away

29
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:10,075
5th dimension teases me
but I still see you

30
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:15,662
let's make our signal
how to say "nice to meet you"

31
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:19,322
and I chase your name

32
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:49,365
Taki. Taki.

33
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:52,578
Don't you remember me?

34
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,407
My name is...

35
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,244
Mitsuha!

36
00:04:34,917 --> 00:04:36,953
Mitsuha, what are you doing?

37
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:41,456
Well, it feels incredibly realistic...

38
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:43,532
What? "Mitsuha"?

39
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,822
Are you half-asleep? Breakfast!

40
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:48,532
Hurry up!

41
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,574
What? What?

42
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,908
Do you want last night's leftovers?

43
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,831
You can have them.

44
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:25,703
Good morning. Good morning.

45
00:05:25,917 --> 00:05:27,373
Mitsuha, you're late!

46
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,074
I'll make breakfast tomorrow.

47
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:36,743
Is this too much?

48
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,368
Oh, well.

49
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,494
You're normal today.

50
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,414
You were nuts yesterday.

51
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,207
What are you talking about?

52
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:50,451
Good morning, everyone.

53
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:55,286
This is an announcement
from ltomori town hall.

54
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,333
Regarding the mayoral election

55
00:05:58,542 --> 00:06:03,411
to be held on the 20th next month,
the election committee...

56
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:06,538
"Comet to pass by in a month:
Visible to the naked eye"

57
00:06:06,542 --> 00:06:12,082
"comet to pass by in a month: Visible to the naked eye" a comet
with an orbital period of 1,200 years will pass by in a month.

58
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:12,242
A comet with an orbital period
of 1,200 years will pass by in a month.

59
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:16,406
The comet will be visible
to the naked eye for several days...

60
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,490
Just make it up with him.

61
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:19,993
It's an adult matter.

62
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:20,196
"Position of comet tiamat"

63
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:23,496
ee

64
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:23,704
Jaxa is preparing to observe
the celestial show of the century.

65
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:24,572
Jaxa is preparing to observe
the celestial show of the century.

66
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:27,183
Jaxa is preparing to observe
the celestial show of the century.

67
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,789
We're going now!
We're going now!

68
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:05,124
Study hard!

69
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,490
Mitsuha!

70
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,539
Morning, Sayaka, Tessie.

71
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,489
Morning.

72
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,450
Get off. Why? Meanie.

73
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:19,248
You're heavy. That's rude.

74
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,289
You two get along so well.

75
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,491
We do not! We do not!

76
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,869
Your hair looks all right today.

77
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,083
What?

78
00:07:29,292 --> 00:07:32,079
Yeah, did your grandma exorcise you?

79
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:34,999
Exorcise?
You were totally possessed!

80
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:40,373
Cut out the occult stuff.
Mitsuha is just stressed. Right?

81
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,120
Huh? What are you talking about?

82
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,119
You don't remember?

83
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,865
And above all,

84
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:53,453
restoring the town's fiscal health
to continue its revitalization project!

85
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:55,373
Only when these are achieved

86
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:59,280
can a safe and secure
community be created!

87
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,582
As the incumbent mayor...

88
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:04,374
He'll just be reelected again anyway.

89
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:07,495
I heard he's been dishing out the pork.

90
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,073
Hey, miyamizu.

91
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:10,748
Morning.

92
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:14,325
So the mayor's kid and
his contractor's kid get along, too.

93
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:15,952
Ew.

94
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,998
Mitsuha!

95
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,995
Stand up straight!

96
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:28,200
He's strict with his family.
I'm impressed.

97
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:31,284
So embarrassing.
Sucks to be her.

98
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,206
Mitsuha.

99
00:08:34,042 --> 00:08:36,328
In front of everybody...

100
00:08:39,417 --> 00:08:40,657
"Who are you?"

101
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:49,657
"Tasokare"

102
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:50,656
"tasokare" "tasokare" means "who is that" and
is the origin of the word "tasogare-doki."

103
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:55,912
"Tasokare" means "who is that" and is
the origin of the word "tasogare-doki."

104
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:59,617
Twilight, when it's neither day nor night.

105
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:05,578
When the world blurs and one might
encounter something not human.

106
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:10,081
Older expressions include " karetaso-doki"

107
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:10,326
"karetaso/kawatare = who is that?"

108
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:13,120
"Karetaso/kawatare = who is that?"
And "kawatare-doki."

109
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:13,329
"Karetaso/kawatare = who is that?"

110
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,540
"Karetaso/kawatare = who is that?"
Question! Not "kataware-doki"?

111
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:15,655
"Karetaso/kawatare = who is that?"

112
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,572
Kataware-doki?
I think that's a local dialect.

113
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,828
I've heard that itomori's elderly
still use classical language.

114
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,243
I've heard that itomori's elderly
still use classical language.

115
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:23,454
"Who are you?"

116
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,414
Eee lsees toor en ee res

117
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:26,657
"who are you?"

118
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,831
Okay, next: Mitsuha.

119
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:31,578
Yes!

120
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:35,496
Oh, so you remember your name today.

121
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,911
You don't remember?

122
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,618
Yesterday you forgot
where your desk and locker were.

123
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:49,325
You had bedhead and no ribbon.

124
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:53,658
What? No way! Really?

125
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,161
It was like you had amnesia.

126
00:09:56,375 --> 00:10:00,948
Well, I do feel like I've been
in a strange dream lately...

127
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:04,204
A dream about someone else's life?

128
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:07,329
I can't remember clearly.

129
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:09,828
I know! That was...

130
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,157
Your previous life!

131
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:15,368
Or maybe your subconscious
linked to the Everett multiverse...

132
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:16,583
Stay out of this.

133
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:20,705
Oh! Tessie, did you
write that in my notebook?

134
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,411
Nothing.

135
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:28,117
But mitsuha, you really were
a bit weird yesterday.

136
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,915
You been feeling all right?

137
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:34,659
That's so strange. I feel fine.

138
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:38,538
Maybe it's stress.
That ritual is coming up, isn't it?

139
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,162
Oh, don't remind me!

140
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,162
I can't stand this town anymore.

141
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:49,790
It's too small and close-knit.
I want to graduate and go to Tokyo.

142
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,199
I don't blame you.
There's really nothing in this town.

143
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,536
Trains come every two hours.

144
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,581
The store closes at 9 P.M.

145
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:02,578
No bookstore. No dentist.

146
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:02,826
But two pubs for some reason.

147
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,165
But two pubs for some reason.

148
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:05,280
"Mother's" "cat's eye pub"

149
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,160
no jobs.

150
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,410
No brides.

151
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,332
Short sunlight hours.

152
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:14,325
Give me a break! What?

153
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:17,579
I mean... how about we stop by a café?

154
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:19,157
A café? Really?

155
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,990
Where? Where?

156
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,750
Hello.

157
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:27,953
Hello.

158
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,785
This is a café?

159
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,991
You knew there wasn't one.

160
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:39,655
Mitsuha just went home.

161
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,036
Things must be rough for her.

162
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,536
Well, she takes center stage.

163
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,411
Yeah.

164
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,368
Hey, Tessie.

165
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,073
What?

166
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:54,999
What will you do after you graduate?

167
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:58,496
What's this? You asking about my future?

168
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:05,082
Nothing special. I'll probably keep on
living a normal life in this town.

169
00:12:20,917 --> 00:12:23,078
I'd rather do that, too.

170
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:25,783
You're not ready yet, yotsuha.

171
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,207
Listen to the thread's voice.

172
00:12:28,417 --> 00:12:31,409
When you keep spooling like that,

173
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:35,789
emotions will eventually start flowing
between you and the thread.

174
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,410
Threads don't talk.

175
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,536
She means, "concentrate."

176
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:45,495
1,000 years of itomori's history
is etched into our braided cords.

177
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:49,451
Listen. 200 years ago...

178
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:51,032
Here she goes again.

179
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:58,156
Sandal maker mayugoro's bathroom caught
on fire and burned down this whole area.

180
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:01,492
The shrine and
old documents were destroyed

181
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:02,948
and this is known as...

182
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:05,158
The great fire of mayugoro.

183
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:09,869
The fire has his name? Poor mayugoro.

184
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:16,739
So we lost the meaning of our festivals,
and only the form lived on.

185
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,576
But even if words are lost,
tradition should be handed down.

186
00:13:20,792 --> 00:13:25,616
That's the important task
we at miyamizu shrine have.

187
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:32,160
But that foolish son-in-law...

188
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:37,285
As if leaving shinto priesthood
and this house weren't enough,

189
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,162
now politics? He's hopeless.

190
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,082
Have another, my man.

191
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,831
I'm counting on your help again.

192
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:49,532
Leave it to me.

193
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,163
You'll get votes from the kadoiri
and sakagami districts.

194
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,615
How's it going with her?

195
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,744
It's not that easy.

196
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,449
I smell corruption.

197
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,578
Don't be ridiculous.

198
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:04,953
Bring us a few more hot saké.

199
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:06,202
Okay.

200
00:14:06,417 --> 00:14:08,874
Katsuhiko, work on site this weekend.

201
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,540
Learn how to use explosives.

202
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:13,458
Can't hear you.

203
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,035
Yes!

204
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:31,280
We both have it rough, don't we?

205
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,912
Is that yotsuha? She's all grown up.

206
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,912
They're both pretty like their mother.

207
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:57,823
Hey.

208
00:14:58,042 --> 00:14:59,452
Hey.

209
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:34,079
It's the oldest saké in the world.

210
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:39,491
By chewing on rice, spitting it out,
and letting it ferment, it becomes alcohol.

211
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:44,577
"Kuchikamizake." do the gods
appreciate saké made that way?

212
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:46,783
Of course they do.

213
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:51,409
Hey, look. It's miyamizu.

214
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,699
Oh! I could never do that!

215
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,373
Isn't she embarrassed?

216
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,790
I can't believe it.

217
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:21,582
Cheer up, mitsuha. Who cares
if a few classmates saw you?

218
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:24,864
I envy your prepubescent lack of concern.

219
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:29,747
Why not sell lots of kuchikamizake
and use the money to go to Tokyo?

220
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,290
Where do you get such ideas?

221
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:38,075
Sell them with photos and making-of videos.
Name it "shrine maiden's saké."

222
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:39,907
You'll make money!

223
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,908
"Shrine maiden's saké"

224
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,870
no. That breaks the liquor tax law.

225
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:49,248
That's the problem?

226
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:59,869
I hate this town! I hate this life!

227
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:04,531
Please make me a handsome
Tokyo boy in my next life!

228
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,832
What a fool...

229
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:39,827
Ow!

230
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:44,032
Ouch...

231
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:54,202
Where...

232
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:08,040
Something's there...

233
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Ow!

234
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,082
Taki! Are you up?

235
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:29,830
It was your turn to cook. Wake up on time.

236
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,624
I'm sorry.

237
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:36,280
I'm going now. Finish up the miso soup.

238
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,615
Okay.

239
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:41,280
Go to school even if you're late. See you.

240
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,115
Have a nice day.

241
00:18:55,042 --> 00:18:56,578
What a strange dream.

242
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:01,245
"From tsukasa: Run, you're late!"

243
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:06,497
What? Who's it from? Tsukasa? Who's that?

244
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,911
I have to use the bathroom.

245
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:28,783
This is too realistic.

246
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,949
"Shinjuku station"

247
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:41,999
I'm in Tokyo!

248
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:48,451
"Jingu high school"

249
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,365
where'd you get it? Daikanyama.

250
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,289
The opening act at the next gig...

251
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,786
Let's skip club and go to a movie.

252
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,660
Taki!

253
00:21:03,042 --> 00:21:07,081
Arriving at noon, huh? Let's eat lunch.

254
00:21:07,292 --> 00:21:08,623
You ignored my text.

255
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,494
Oh, tsukasa?

256
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:13,871
At least you sound apologetic.

257
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,540
You got lost? Yeah.

258
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,197
How could you get lost
on the way to school?

259
00:21:21,417 --> 00:21:24,864
Uh... well... I...
Feminine pronouns?

260
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,914
I!

261
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,661
I?

262
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,285
I?

263
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:38,033
I was enjoying myself.
It's so festive and all in Tokyo.

264
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,536
You seem to have an accent.

265
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,615
Where's your lunch?

266
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,324
Geez. Are you half-asleep?

267
00:21:45,542 --> 00:21:49,080
You got something?
Croquette-egg sandwich sounds good!

268
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,698
Thank you.

269
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,693
Let's go to the café after school.

270
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,207
Oh, that one? Okay. Coming, taki?

271
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:03,250
What? What? What?

272
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:04,994
A café?

273
00:22:08,167 --> 00:22:09,748
Nice timberwork up there.

274
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:12,165
Yeah, attention to detail.

275
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,536
Taki, have you decided?

276
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:19,490
What? I could live for a month
for the price of these!

277
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:22,120
What era are you from again?

278
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:26,576
Hmm. Oh, well. It is a dream.

279
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,456
What a great dream.

280
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:43,288
Oh no, what should I do? I'm late for work!

281
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,240
Your shift is today?

282
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:48,530
Go, then. Oh, yeah.

283
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,947
Oh! Um...

284
00:22:52,167 --> 00:22:54,658
Where do I work?

285
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,706
What? What?

286
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:04,744
Tables 6, 7, and 10 are waiting!

287
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:07,244
Table 12! Taki!

288
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:09,289
Here you go.

289
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,287
Uh, zucchini and tomato salad...

290
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,910
We didn't order that.

291
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:16,537
Taki, I said we're out of truffles!

292
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,456
Taki, can't hear youl!

293
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:20,077
Taki!

294
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:23,958
When is this dream going to end?

295
00:23:31,917 --> 00:23:33,908
Hey. Hey, waiter.

296
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,865
Oh, yes?

297
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,950
There was a toothpick in our pizza.

298
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:44,079
We could have gotten hurt.

299
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:48,786
Good thing I noticed.
What do you have to say?

300
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,161
Uh, well...

301
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:56,995
But... there are no toothpicks
in an Italian restaurant's...

302
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:58,789
Excuse me.

303
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,707
Is everything okay?

304
00:24:01,917 --> 00:24:03,327
I'll handle this.

305
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,537
What's wrong with you today?

306
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,947
Please accept our apologies.
Your meal is on the house.

307
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:12,167
Oh, really?

308
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,915
I hope you weren't hurt.

309
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,035
Um...

310
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,250
Okudera...

311
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:29,123
Ms. okudera.

312
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,289
Ms. okudera. Thank you...

313
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,831
A stroke of bad luck today.

314
00:24:33,042 --> 00:24:34,042
No, uh...

315
00:24:34,167 --> 00:24:36,078
Bet it was a set-up.

316
00:24:36,292 --> 00:24:39,739
Handled it according to the manual, but...

317
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:43,997
Oh, Ms. okudera, your skirt!

318
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:45,208
You okay?

319
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,707
What happened? Slashed.

320
00:24:47,917 --> 00:24:49,327
That dick from earlier?

321
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:51,624
What now? Do you remember his face?

322
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:53,164
No.

323
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:55,161
Come with me.

324
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:57,491
Hey, taki!

325
00:24:57,708 --> 00:24:59,369
Take off your skirt.

326
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:02,245
Oh! I'll look the other way!

327
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:08,244
This won't take long.

328
00:25:12,417 --> 00:25:14,954
Done!

329
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:19,080
Wow, taki! It looks better than before!

330
00:25:20,417 --> 00:25:23,864
Thank you for saving me today.

331
00:25:25,542 --> 00:25:29,114
Actually, I was concerned about you.

332
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:33,121
You're weak but quick-tempered.

333
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:35,540
I like you better today.

334
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:39,413
Never knew you had a feminine side.

335
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:42,449
"Jr yamanote line: 7 min."

336
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:53,572
What a realistic dream,
if I do say so myself.

337
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,242
Oh, he keeps a diary.

338
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,536
He's so organized.

339
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:09,332
Wish I lived in Tokyo, too.

340
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:14,620
Oh! That's her!

341
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:21,540
A crush, maybe?

342
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:32,954
"Walked to the station with Ms. okudera
after work, thanks to my feminine powers!"

343
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:35,782
"Who are you?"

344
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:49,281
"Mitsuha"

345
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:06,289
What is this?

346
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:06,701
. ° what is this? =
meee ee sero es tae es

347
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:07,788
"mitsuha"

348
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:13,120
wha...? Wha...?

349
00:27:13,292 --> 00:27:13,326
"Thanks to my feminine powers!"

350
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:15,244
"Thanks to my feminine powers!"

351
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,490
"Thanks to my feminine powers!"

352
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,956
Let's hit a café again today.

353
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:20,533
Sorry, I have to go to work.

354
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,741
Do you remember where to go?

355
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:28,906
Tsukasa, was it you who pranked my phone?

356
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:33,038
Oh, never mind. See you.

357
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,741
He's acting normal today.

358
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:38,449
Yesterday he was kind of cute.

359
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:40,077
What?

360
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:44,203
Wha... what?

361
00:27:44,417 --> 00:27:46,624
Taki, you tried to outdo us!

362
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:48,915
You walked home with her!

363
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,662
Did I really? With Ms. okudera?

364
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:55,706
What happened afterwards?

365
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:58,664
I don't really remember.

366
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:00,740
Oh, really, now?

367
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:03,540
Okudera, coming through!

368
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:06,494
Hi, guys. Hello.

369
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,331
Let's make this a good one.

370
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:11,578
Right, taki?

371
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:24,700
"Mitsuha? Who are you? What are you?"

372
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,950
Breakfast is ready! Hurry up!

373
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:35,578
Boobs?

374
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:39,198
Morning.

375
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:47,537
Why is everyone staring at me?

376
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,947
Well, you made quite a scene yesterday.

377
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:52,577
Huh?

378
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:54,458
"Still-life drawing"

379
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:56,197
did you see the election posters?

380
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:59,614
Doesn't matter who wins. It's all about
how to serve up the grants.

381
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:02,996
Shh! Someone's livelihood depends on it.

382
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,207
They mean me, right?

383
00:29:06,417 --> 00:29:08,703
Well, yeah.

384
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:10,578
Hey, mitsuhal!

385
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:25,453
Wha...? Wha...? I did what?

386
00:29:27,542 --> 00:29:29,032
Mitsuha?

387
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,956
"What is this life?!"

388
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:38,745

Could it be that we're really...

In our dreams, that guy and I are...

392
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:49,165
In our dreams, that girl and I are...

393
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:50,156
"Life in Tokyo" "what is this life?!"
In our dreams, that girl and I are...

394
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:50,246
"Life in Tokyo" "what is this life?!"

395
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:52,161
Switching places?
Switching places?

396
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:29,038
I'm beginning to get what's going on.

397
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:32,572
Taki is a boy my age living in Tokyo.

398
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:35,534
I switch with mitsuha at random,

399
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,332
a few times a week, unexpectedly.

400
00:30:38,542 --> 00:30:39,657
Sleep triggers it. The cause is a mystery.

401
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:41,874
"Condition: Sleep? Cause: Unknown"
sleep triggers it. The cause is a mystery.

402
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:42,079
"Condition: Sleep? Cause: Unknown"

403
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:42,162
"condition: Sleep? Cause: Unknown" my memory
of the switch is hazy after I wake up.

404
00:30:42,167 --> 00:30:46,957
My memory of the switch
is hazy after I wake up.

405
00:30:47,167 --> 00:30:50,409
But we're definitely switching places.

406
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:54,197
It's obvious from the reactions
of the people around us. So...

407
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:55,998
So we laid down some rules
to protect each other's lifestyles.

408
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,117
So we laid down some rules
to protect each other's lifestyles.

409
00:30:59,125 --> 00:30:59,329
So we laid down some rules
to protect each other's lifestyles.

410
00:30:59,333 --> 00:30:59,492
"No baths! No looking! No touching!" So we laid
down some rules to protect each other's lifestyles.

411
00:30:59,500 --> 00:30:59,704
"No baths! No looking! No touching!"

412
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:02,165
"No baths! No looking! No touching!" Things to watch
out for during the switch, and a list of "don'ts."

413
00:31:02,167 --> 00:31:02,371
Things to watch out for during
the switch, and a list of "don'ts."

414
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:04,366
Things to watch out for during
the switch, and a list of "don'ts."

415
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:04,579
“Don't waste money!
No dialect! Don't be late!"

Ee te ee ne st pei ss s sees ee ot

417
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:08,992
we also agreed to leave reports
in our smartphones.

418
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:13,872
To work together to tide over
this mysterious phenomenon.

419
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:15,368
But...

420
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,323
But...

421
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,828
That girl! That guy!

422
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:37,739
Guys are staring! Watch the skirt!
Come on, this is basic!

423
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,081
Guys are staring! Watch the skirt!
Come on, this is basic!

424
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:41,364
Guys are staring! Watch the skirt!
Come on, this is basic!

425
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:43,782
Stop wasting my money!

426
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,992
It's your body eating.
And I'm working, too!

427
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
"Braided cords..."

428
00:31:48,417 --> 00:31:48,872
Braided cords... I can't do this!

429
00:31:49,083 --> 00:31:50,789
You work too many shifts!

430
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,116
It's 'cause you waste money!

431
00:32:12,958 --> 00:32:17,201
Grabbed coffee with Ms. okudera.
You two have a good thing going!

432
00:32:17,417 --> 00:32:20,864
Mitsuha, stop changing my relationships!

433
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:24,496
Taki, why is a girl in love with me?

434
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:27,290
You're more popular when I'm you.

435
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,900
Don't be so full of yourself!
Not like you have a girlfriend!

436
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,412
"Don't be so full of yourself!"

437
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:30,496
"Don't be so full of yourself!"

438
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,580
You don't have a boyfriend!

439
00:32:33,542 --> 00:32:33,621
I'm single because I want to be!
I'm single because I want to be!

440
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:35,616
I'm single because I want to be!
I'm single because I want to be!

441
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:38,345
I'm single because I want to be!
I'm single because I want to be!

442
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,616
I shouldn't... for her sake.

443
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,616
You sure do like your boobs.

444
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:08,495
We're going now! Get ready!

445
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:15,164
Comet tiamat has been visible
to the naked eye for a few days now.

446
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:17,240
When and where can it be seen?

00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:17,614

450
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:23,579
comet tiamat is moving from
east to west as if to follow the sun.

451
00:33:23,792 --> 00:33:25,578
So it can be seen above Venus...

452
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:27,874
Why the uniform?

453
00:33:35,542 --> 00:33:40,866
Grandma, why is the vessel
of our shrine's god so far away?

454
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:44,371
I don't know, thanks to mayugoro.

455
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:45,583
Who's that?

456
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,786
What? He's famous!

457
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,949
Here, grandma.

458
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:04,829
Whoa, mitsuha.

459
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:19,956
Mitsuha, yotsuha, do you know "musubi"?

460
00:34:20,167 --> 00:34:20,952
Musubi?

461
00:34:21,167 --> 00:34:26,491
Musubi is the old term
for calling the local guardian deity.

462
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:29,996
This word has profound meaning.

463
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:35,623
Tying thread is musubi.
Connecting people is musubi.

464
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:38,700
The flow of time is musubi.

465
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:41,909
These are all the god's power.

466
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:44,958
So the braided cords that we make

467
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:51,447
are the god's art,
and represent the flow of time itself.

468
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:54,249
They converge and take shape.

469
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:56,790
They twist, tangle,

470
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,869
sometimes unravel,
break, then connect again.

471
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:05,951
Musubi: Knotting. That's time.

472
00:35:08,917 --> 00:35:09,952
Drink.

473
00:35:10,167 --> 00:35:11,703
Thank you.

474
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:13,914
I want some, too!

475
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:16,241
That's also musubi.

476
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,991
Whether it be water, rice, or saké,

477
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:25,703
when a person consumes something
and it joins their soul, that's musubi.

478
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:28,329
So today's offering

479
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:34,242
is an important custom
that connects the god and its people.

480
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:37,573
Hey, I see it!

481
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:45,491
That's the vessel of miyamizu shrine's god?

482
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:05,913
Beyond this point is the "kakuriyo."

483
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:08,411
It means the underworld.

484
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,953
I'm in the underworld!

485
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,414
In exchange for returning to this world,
you must leave behind

486
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:21,162
what is most important to you.

487
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:25,415
The kuchikamizake.

488
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,615
The kuchikamizake?

489
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:31,530
You'll offer it inside the god's vessel.

490
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:36,119
It's half of you.

491
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:39,405
Half of mitsuha...

492
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,991
It's twilight already... "Kataware-doki."

493
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:01,415
Kataware-doki?

494
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:12,542
Oh, yeah,

495
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:14,664
maybe we can see the comet.

496
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:17,824
The comet?

497
00:37:18,042 --> 00:37:19,248
Oh?

498
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:21,073
Mitsuha,

499
00:37:21,292 --> 00:37:25,114
you're dreaming right now, aren't you?

500
00:37:35,917 --> 00:37:38,909
Tears? Why?

501
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:43,241
"I'm almost there. Looking forward to it!"

502
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:47,447
Ms. okudera? What's she talking about?

503
00:37:48,458 --> 00:37:50,574
What did mitsuha do this time?

504
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,490
A date?

505
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:03,913
A date with Ms. okudera tomorrow!

506
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:07,617
Meet at 10:30 A.M. at the station!

507
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:11,530
Or so I'd planned, but...

508
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,660
Taki.

509
00:38:27,917 --> 00:38:29,123
Sorry. Did you wait long?

510
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:30,948
Yes. No...

511
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:33,249
Um...

512
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:42,698
I just got here.

513
00:38:42,917 --> 00:38:46,614
Good. Let's go.

514
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:50,951
He's so lucky. They must
be together right about now...

515
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:56,073
Huh?

516
00:39:02,042 --> 00:39:03,873
Why?

517
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:12,199
I wanted to go on this date,

518
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:18,162
but if it so happens that you
end up going, you better enjoy it!

519
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:28,325
However, I'm sure you've never
gone out on a date before...

520
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:30,498
I don't know what to say...

521
00:39:30,708 --> 00:39:34,951
So below are some links
to help you out, you late bloomer.

522
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:36,577
Really?

523
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,278
"You, too, can get a girlfriend!"

524
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,493
"Despite social anxiety, I got a girl!
The dos and don'ts of texting"

525
00:39:43,917 --> 00:39:45,999
she's making fun of me.

00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:20,746
You're like a different person today.

530
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:36,245
Um, Ms. okudera. Are you hungry?
How about dinner?

531
00:40:36,458 --> 00:40:38,574
Let's call it a day.

532
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,240
Yes.

533
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:45,121
Taki, you... sorry if I'm wrong.

534
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:50,952
You used to have
a bit of a crush on me, right?

535
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:54,489
But now you like someone else.

536
00:40:56,625 --> 00:40:57,705
No I don't!

537
00:40:57,917 --> 00:40:58,917
Really?

538
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,457
No! That's not true at all.

539
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,500
I wonder.

540
00:41:04,708 --> 00:41:08,530
Oh, well. Thanks for today.
See you at work.

541
00:41:22,667 --> 00:41:28,242
By the time the date is over,
the comet will be visible in the sky.

542
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:34,287
What is she saying?

543
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,740
"Mitsuha miyamizu"

544
00:42:02,417 --> 00:42:05,955
Oh, it's you, Tessie.

545
00:42:06,167 --> 00:42:11,582
No, I just didn't feel like going,
that's all. I'm fine.

546
00:42:11,792 --> 00:42:15,455
What? The festival? Well...

547
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:21,947
Oh, yeah, the comet. Today's the peak
of its brightness, isn't it?

548
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:25,409
Okay, got it. Later, then.

549
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:30,330
You just want to see her in a yukata.

550
00:42:30,542 --> 00:42:32,453
What?! No!

551
00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:35,033
That didn't even occur to me.

552
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:38,658
Hey, she sounded kind of down.

553
00:42:38,875 --> 00:42:40,706
Maybe you annoyed her.

554
00:42:40,917 --> 00:42:42,032
Come on!

555
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,035
Sorry I'm late.

556
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:45,115
Here she is! Finally!

557
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:50,781
Your... your...
Oh! What happened, mitsuha?

558
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,207
Your hair!

559
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:56,375
Looks kinda funny, huh.

560
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:08,163
You think some guy
is the reason? Ditched, maybe?

561
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:11,412
Why do guys associate
cutting hair with breakups?

562
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:13,661
She said she just felt like it.

563
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:17,163
Really? She just felt like
cutting off that much hair?

564
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:20,867
Oh! Hey! You can see it!

565
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:40,953
Wow!

566
00:43:59,208 --> 00:44:04,908
The phone you are trying to reach
is out of range or has been turned off...

567
00:44:07,375 --> 00:44:12,540
“I'll tell her about the disastrous date
the next time we switch,"

568
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,867
I thought. But...

569
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:18,825
For some reason, after that,

570
00:44:19,042 --> 00:44:23,490
mitsuha and I
never switched places again.

571
00:44:58,417 --> 00:45:01,409
"Mountains in gifu prefecture"

572
00:45:12,208 --> 00:45:13,823
"Hida mountains"

573
00:46:16,083 --> 00:46:21,157
What the... what are you doing here?

574
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:26,079
Tsukasa told me and here I am!

575
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:35,074
Tsukasa, I asked you to
cover for me at home and at work.

576
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,702
Takagi will cover your shift.

577
00:46:36,917 --> 00:46:40,205
Leave it to me! But you owe me a meal!

578
00:46:40,417 --> 00:46:41,827
This isn't funny.

579
00:46:42,042 --> 00:46:44,283
We were worried about you. Huh?

580
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,492
You can't go alone. What if it's a con act?

581
00:46:47,708 --> 00:46:48,743
A con act?

582
00:46:48,958 --> 00:46:51,119
You're meeting an online friend, right?

583
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:53,540
Well, no, not exactly...

584
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:56,617
I think he's using a dating site.
No!

585
00:46:56,833 --> 00:47:00,405
You've been acting weird lately.
We'll keep an eye on you.

586
00:47:00,625 --> 00:47:02,911
I'm not a kid!

587
00:47:04,583 --> 00:47:09,623
The switching stopped.
My calls and texts didn't go through.

588
00:47:09,833 --> 00:47:14,372
So I decided
to go see mitsuha in person.

589
00:47:14,583 --> 00:47:18,121
I wanted to meet her. But...

590
00:47:19,292 --> 00:47:24,582
What? You don't know where?
The town's scenery is your only clue?

591
00:47:24,792 --> 00:47:26,202
Yes.

592
00:47:28,458 --> 00:47:31,780
And you can't contact her?
What's this all about?

593
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,616
Seriously. What a lousy tour planner.

594
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:35,993
I didn't plan any tour!

595
00:47:36,208 --> 00:47:39,450
Oh, well. We'll help you look for her.

596
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:42,704
Oh, how cute! Look!

597
00:47:42,917 --> 00:47:43,917
So annoying.

598
00:47:43,958 --> 00:47:45,664
Oh, it moved!

599
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:16,040
So it's impossible after all...

600
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:20,448
What? After all the trouble
we went through?

601
00:48:22,917 --> 00:48:25,408
You haven't done anything.

602
00:48:30,167 --> 00:48:31,452
A takayama ramen.

603
00:48:31,667 --> 00:48:33,282
Oh, then a takayama ramen.

604
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:37,493
Okay. Three ramens. Okay.

605
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,991
Can we return to Tokyo today?

606
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:44,245
We could be cutting it close. I'll check.

607
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:45,197
Thanks.

608
00:48:45,417 --> 00:48:48,284
Are you all right with that?

609
00:48:50,375 --> 00:48:54,789
I'm starting to feel like
I'm barking up the wrong tree.

610
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:02,701
Why, young man, that's itomori, isn't it?

611
00:49:03,792 --> 00:49:07,660
It's a very good drawing. Isn't it, dear?

612
00:49:08,667 --> 00:49:12,034
Yeah, it's itomori. Brings back memories.

613
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,457
He was born in itomori.

614
00:49:14,667 --> 00:49:16,453
Itomori...?

615
00:49:17,792 --> 00:49:22,616
Yes! Itomori town!
That's it! It's nearby, isn't it?

616
00:49:22,833 --> 00:49:25,620
What are you... ltomori was...

617
00:49:25,833 --> 00:49:28,290
Itomori? No way!

618
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,458
Is it where that comet...?

619
00:49:39,375 --> 00:49:42,367
"Keep out"

620
00:50:20,625 --> 00:50:23,742
Hey. Is this really the place?

621
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:27,871
No way! Taki must be misremembering.

622
00:50:28,083 --> 00:50:31,780
No. I'm sure this is it.

623
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,415
This schoolyard. The mountains.
I remember this high school clearly!

624
00:50:37,625 --> 00:50:39,411
That can't be true!

625
00:50:39,625 --> 00:50:45,291
Surely you remember that disaster
three years ago, where hundreds died?

626
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,661
Died?

627
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:51,447
Died, three years ago?

628
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:54,493
That can't be.

629
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:59,156
I still have the notes
that she left behind...

630
00:51:16,167 --> 00:51:17,748
They're disappearing...

631
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:29,950
Comet tiamat, with an
orbital period of 1,200 years,

00:51:29,958 --> 00:51:30,492

633
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:30,704

634
00:51:30,708 --> 00:51:34,621
"itomori, the town that vanished"

635
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:34,704
"itomori, the town that vanished"

636
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:34,912
nobody could predict that its nucleus
would split at its perigee.

637
00:51:34,917 --> 00:51:38,705
"Meteor strikes, wipes out town" nobody could predict
that its nucleus would split at its perigee.

638
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:40,268
Nobody could predict that its nucleus
would split at its perigee.

639
00:51:40,292 --> 00:51:41,748
"Town annihilated"

640
00:51:41,958 --> 00:51:43,494
"over 500 dead or missing"

641
00:51:43,708 --> 00:51:45,073
"itomori, the town that vanished"

642
00:51:46,583 --> 00:51:50,326
a fragment of the comet
became a meteor that struck Japan.

643
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:50,662
A fragment of the comet
became a meteor that struck Japan.

644
00:51:50,667 --> 00:51:52,328
"Itomori, comet, damage"

645
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:53,197
"itomori, comet, damage"
it was the day of the Autumn festival.

646
00:51:53,208 --> 00:51:56,280
It was the day of the Autumn festival.

647
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,242
The point of impact was here.

648
00:51:59,458 --> 00:52:05,158
At 8:42 P.M., it struck where people
were gathered for the festival.

649
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:08,869
"Names of the victims"

00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:10,706

651
00:52:10,708 --> 00:52:12,994
over 500 people died,
a third of the town's population,

652
00:52:13,208 --> 00:52:17,406
and now nobody
lives in itomori anymore.

653
00:52:29,708 --> 00:52:32,324
"Mitsuha miyamizu"

654
00:52:32,333 --> 00:52:34,198
"mitsuha miyamizu"

655
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:34,242
that's her?

656
00:52:34,458 --> 00:52:39,248
It has to be some kind of mistake.
This person died three years ago!

657
00:52:39,458 --> 00:52:45,704
Just two, three weeks ago, she said to me
that the comet would be visible!

658
00:52:45,917 --> 00:52:46,702
So...

659
00:52:46,917 --> 00:52:49,033
You're dreaming right now...

660
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:52,574
Aren't you?

661
00:52:56,083 --> 00:52:58,074
What did I...?

662
00:53:11,667 --> 00:53:13,453
Lively up there.

663
00:53:13,667 --> 00:53:16,079
I'm sorry we could only get one room.

664
00:53:16,292 --> 00:53:18,658
No problem.

665
00:53:18,875 --> 00:53:19,875
How's taki?

666
00:53:19,917 --> 00:53:22,989
He's still reading articles on itomori.

667
00:53:23,208 --> 00:53:27,030
Newspapers and magazines
from back then, whatever he can find.

668
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:35,159
What?
Nothing. I didn't know you smoked.

669
00:53:35,375 --> 00:53:39,243
Oh. I had quit, but...

670
00:53:39,458 --> 00:53:42,950
What do you think about taki's story?

671
00:53:45,833 --> 00:53:48,324
I liked him.

672
00:53:48,542 --> 00:53:54,663
The way he was recently. He was always
a nice guy, but even more so lately.

673
00:53:54,875 --> 00:53:59,289
Like he was trying so hard. It was cute.

674
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:03,743
What he's saying
doesn't make sense to me...

675
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:11,575
But I'm sure he met someone,
and that someone changed him.

676
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:13,702
That much is for sure, I think.

677
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:16,290
"Worst-ever itomori comet disaster"
that much is for sure, I think.

678
00:54:16,292 --> 00:54:17,692
"Worst-ever itomori comet disaster"

679
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:33,072
It was all just a dream.

680
00:54:33,292 --> 00:54:40,039
I recognized the scenery because
I remembered the news from three years ago.

681
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:43,538
If not that, then... a ghost?

682
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:48,915
No... was I delusional?

683
00:54:52,417 --> 00:54:56,535
Her name... what was it?

684
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:01,540
Tsukasa went to take a bath.

685
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:05,288
Oh, Ms. okudera. I, uh...

686
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:11,700
I've been saying such strange things.
Thank you for coming along today.

687
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:16,698
No problem.

688
00:55:16,708 --> 00:55:16,742
Sere ames ee

00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,115

00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:19,994

00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,206
"the braided cords of itomori"

692
00:55:21,208 --> 00:55:22,948
braided cords. How pretty.

693
00:55:23,167 --> 00:55:26,989
Is that a braided cord you're wearing?

694
00:55:27,208 --> 00:55:33,078
Oh, this... I think someone
gave it to me a long time ago.

695
00:55:33,292 --> 00:55:37,331
I wear it sometimes
as kind of a lucky charm...

696
00:55:39,417 --> 00:55:42,534
Who was it?

697
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:45,742
Why don't you go take a bath, too?

698
00:55:45,958 --> 00:55:48,324
Yes. No.

699
00:55:50,708 --> 00:55:55,247
Someone who makes
braided cords once told me...

700
00:55:55,458 --> 00:55:58,370
The cords represent
the flow of time itself.

701
00:55:58,583 --> 00:56:04,988
The threads twist, tangle, unravel,
and connect again. That's time...

702
00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:08,581
Maybe at that place...

703
00:56:26,208 --> 00:56:28,824
"Around here?"

704
00:56:34,208 --> 00:56:36,164
Taki.

705
00:56:36,375 --> 00:56:38,331
Taki.

706
00:56:38,542 --> 00:56:40,157
Taki.

707
00:56:41,208 --> 00:56:43,699
Don't you remember me?

708
00:56:57,458 --> 00:57:02,452
"I have to go somewhere. Go back to Tokyo
without me. I'll return later. Thanks."

709
00:57:05,708 --> 00:57:07,244
Taki...

710
00:57:30,833 --> 00:57:33,950
Eat this up there.

711
00:57:34,167 --> 00:57:38,536
Your drawing of itomori... it was good.

712
00:58:15,292 --> 00:58:19,956
They converge and take shape.
They twist, tangle,

713
00:58:20,167 --> 00:58:24,661
sometimes unravel, then connect again...

714
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:29,869
Musubi: Knotting. That's time.

715
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:41,240
There it is!

716
00:58:43,042 --> 00:58:45,954
It's really there!

717
00:58:46,167 --> 00:58:49,034
It wasn't just a dream!

718
00:59:19,375 --> 00:59:22,367
Beyond this is the underworld.

719
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:48,416
It's the saké we brought.

720
00:59:49,458 --> 00:59:53,076
This is yotsuha's, and this is mitsuha's.

721
00:59:55,667 --> 01:00:03,667
Before the comet struck... so the mitsuha
I know is from three years ago?

722
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:08,155
Our timelines were out of step.

723
01:00:09,042 --> 01:00:11,158
Half of her...

724
01:00:25,875 --> 01:00:28,412
Musubi.

725
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:32,288
If time can really be turned back,

726
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,582
give me one last chance...

727
01:00:48,667 --> 01:00:50,623
A comet!

728
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:58,617
Your name is mitsuha.

729
01:02:04,833 --> 01:02:07,119
You're both my treasures.

730
01:02:07,333 --> 01:02:09,619
You're a big sister now.

731
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:10,159
You're a big sister now.

732
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:12,078
"Get well soon, mom."

733
01:02:12,292 --> 01:02:15,125
I'm so sorry, my dears.

734
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:20,747
Dad, when is mom going to come home?

735
01:02:20,958 --> 01:02:21,958
I couldn't save her.

736
01:02:22,167 --> 01:02:24,078
Get a hold of yourself!

737
01:02:24,292 --> 01:02:25,577
Who cares about the shrine?

738
01:02:25,792 --> 01:02:27,202
You're the adopted son-in-law!

739
01:02:27,417 --> 01:02:30,454
I loved my wife futaba.
Not miyamizu shrine!

740
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:32,248
Get out of here!

741
01:02:34,458 --> 01:02:37,040
Mitsuha, yotsuha,

742
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:40,868
you'll be with grandma from now on.

743
01:02:45,208 --> 01:02:45,446
Who am 1? No, who are you?

744
01:02:45,458 --> 01:02:46,447
Who am 1? No, who are you?

745
01:02:46,458 --> 01:02:46,662
Who am 1? No, who are you?

746
01:02:46,667 --> 01:02:47,747
Who am 1? No, who are you?

747
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:47,954
Who am 1? No, who are you?

748
01:02:47,958 --> 01:02:48,117
Who am 1? No, who are you?

749
01:02:48,125 --> 01:02:48,329
"Fool"

750
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:49,038
mm seers sema x
fr sacameay eissn

751
01:02:49,042 --> 01:02:51,442
don't be so full of yourself.
Not like you have a girlfriend!

752
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:55,322
He's so lucky.
They must be together right about now...

753
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:58,865
I'm going to Tokyo.

754
01:02:59,083 --> 01:03:00,994
What? Hey, mitsuha!

755
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:07,163
Grandma, could you do me a favor?

756
01:03:07,958 --> 01:03:10,870
Oh, yeah, the comet.

757
01:03:11,083 --> 01:03:13,870
Today's the peak of its brightness...

758
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:16,995
Mitsuha! Don't stay there!

759
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:21,781
Mitsuha, get out of there
before the comet strikes!

760
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:26,704
Mitsuha, get out of there!

761
01:03:26,917 --> 01:03:29,329
Mitsuha! Mitsuha!

762
01:03:29,542 --> 01:03:31,908
Mitsuha!

763
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:53,072
I'm mitsuha! She's still alive!

764
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:06,662
Mitsuha, are you touching...

765
01:04:08,375 --> 01:04:10,206
My sister!

766
01:04:12,292 --> 01:04:14,829
Yotsuhal!

767
01:04:17,375 --> 01:04:20,117
Mitsuha has finally lost it.

768
01:04:20,333 --> 01:04:22,915
I'm leaving without her.

769
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:24,990
She's lost it.

770
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:27,620
She's completely lost it.

771
01:04:27,833 --> 01:04:29,118
Scary.

772
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:33,622
Comet tiamat has been visible
to the naked eye for a few days now.

773
01:04:33,833 --> 01:04:37,576
Tonight it will finally reach
its perigee around 7:40 P.M.,

774
01:04:37,792 --> 01:04:40,329
and will achieve its maximum brightness.

775
01:04:40,542 --> 01:04:43,864
It's tonight. There's still time.

776
01:04:44,083 --> 01:04:46,074
Good morning, mitsuha.

777
01:04:46,292 --> 01:04:48,283
Oh...

778
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:52,038
You're not mitsuha, are you?

779
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:55,742
You knew, grandma?

780
01:04:55,958 --> 01:05:03,205
No, but watching the way you've behaved
lately triggered some memories.

781
01:05:03,417 --> 01:05:09,743
I also remember having
strange dreams when I was a young girl.

782
01:05:09,958 --> 01:05:16,204
Although now I've forgotten
whose life I was dreaming about.

783
01:05:16,417 --> 01:05:17,452
Forgotten...

784
01:05:17,667 --> 01:05:22,991
Treasure the experience.
Dreams fade away after you wake up.

785
01:05:23,208 --> 01:05:28,498
Your mother and I
both went through similar phases.

786
01:05:28,708 --> 01:05:32,826
Maybe those dreams
that the miyamizu family had

787
01:05:33,042 --> 01:05:36,239
were all for what will happen today.

788
01:05:36,458 --> 01:05:38,824
Grandma, listen.

789
01:05:39,042 --> 01:05:44,491
A comet will strike itomori tonight
and everyone will die!

790
01:05:51,292 --> 01:05:56,787
"Nobody will believe that"? What a
surprisingly ordinary reply, grandma.

791
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,787
I won't let them die!

792
01:06:00,458 --> 01:06:02,915
Oh! What happened, mitsuha?

793
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:07,448
Your... your hair!

794
01:06:07,667 --> 01:06:10,033
Oh, this. It looked better before, huh?

795
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:11,660
That's it?

796
01:06:11,875 --> 01:06:16,198
Forget that! If nothing is done,
everyone will die tonight!

797
01:06:18,292 --> 01:06:20,908
So we have to act!

798
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:26,956
Why aren't you at school?

799
01:06:27,167 --> 01:06:32,116
Uh... we have to save the town.

800
01:06:33,417 --> 01:06:34,617
The community wireless system?

801
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:37,492
Yeah, those speakers you see everywhere.

802
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:37,659
"Superimposition, frequency"
yeah, those speakers you see everywhere.

803
01:06:37,667 --> 01:06:40,909
"Superimposition, frequency"

804
01:06:41,875 --> 01:06:45,663
I see! That could work!
You're awesome, Tessie!

805
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:48,241
Hey! Not so close!

806
01:06:48,458 --> 01:06:50,574
What, embarrassed? Hey, hey!

807
01:06:50,792 --> 01:06:54,034
Stop! You're a girl of marriageable age!

808
01:06:54,417 --> 01:06:55,953
"Club discontinued - keep out"

809
01:06:55,958 --> 01:06:56,913
"club discontinued - keep out”

810
01:06:56,917 --> 01:06:58,623
you're such a nice guy!

811
01:07:02,042 --> 01:07:04,124
Got them. Here's your change.

812
01:07:04,333 --> 01:07:05,539
Sorry, Sayaka.

813
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:07,081
It's all right.

814
01:07:07,292 --> 01:07:10,284
What a cheap fee. Deal with it.

815
01:07:11,583 --> 01:07:15,952
What about you? Have you
come up with an escape plan?

816
01:07:18,917 --> 01:07:21,704
What? A bomb?

817
01:07:21,917 --> 01:07:26,160
We have water gel explosives
for construction at our storage site.

818
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:27,911
Broadcast hijacking?

819
01:07:28,125 --> 01:07:32,744
The town's wireless system can be
hijacked easily with the startup frequency.

820
01:07:32,958 --> 01:07:36,951
So we can broadcast
an evacuation warning from the school.

821
01:07:37,167 --> 01:07:42,287
The school is outside the disaster area,
so people can evacuate here.

822
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,957
It's... it's totally a crime!

823
01:07:45,167 --> 01:07:46,623
You do the broadcast.

824
01:07:46,833 --> 01:07:49,370
Why?
You're in the broadcast club.

825
01:07:49,583 --> 01:07:51,119
I'm in charge of explosives.

826
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:53,745
I'll go talk to the mayor.

827
01:07:53,958 --> 01:07:57,655
In the end, the city council
has to evacuate everyone.

828
01:07:57,875 --> 01:08:00,833
I'm his daughter. I can persuade him.

829
01:08:01,042 --> 01:08:03,328
It's a perfect plan.

830
01:08:04,333 --> 01:08:08,997
Oh, whatever. It's just
a what-if fantasy, isn't it?

831
01:08:09,208 --> 01:08:11,290
What? Well...

832
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:15,664
Not necessarily! Do you know
how lake itomori was formed?

833
01:08:15,667 --> 01:08:15,871
Not necessarily! Do you know

834
01:08:15,875 --> 01:08:16,079
"a meteor crater lake
formed 1,200 years ago."

835
01:08:16,083 --> 01:08:19,655
"A meteor crater lake formed 1,200 years ago." It's a meteor
crater! So one did strike this area a thousand years ago!

836
01:08:19,667 --> 01:08:21,643
It's a meteor crater! So one did
strike this area a thousand years ago!

837
01:08:21,667 --> 01:08:23,623
Oh! So that's why...

838
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:25,824
You're right, Tessie!

839
01:08:29,417 --> 01:08:31,749
Let's do this together!
Let's do this together!

840
01:08:35,333 --> 01:08:38,120
What on earth are you talking about?

841
01:08:39,875 --> 01:08:43,322
I said, we have to evacuate
everyone in town before tonight or...

842
01:08:43,542 --> 01:08:45,453
Shut your mouth.

843
01:08:50,625 --> 01:08:53,913
"The comet will split and strike the town"?

844
01:08:53,917 --> 01:08:53,996
"Itomori town hall"
"the comet will split and strike the town"?

845
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
"Itomori town hall"

846
01:08:56,917 --> 01:08:57,030
"over 500 people will die"?

847
01:08:57,250 --> 01:09:00,538
How dare you spout such nonsense?

848
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:04,038
If you're serious, then you're sick.

849
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:08,243
Madness must be from the miyamizu side.

850
01:09:08,458 --> 01:09:12,827
I'll get someone to drive you
to a hospital in the city.

851
01:09:13,042 --> 01:09:16,910
I'll listen to you
after a doctor examines you.

852
01:09:20,083 --> 01:09:21,948
You son of a...!

853
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:34,326
Mitsuha! No...

854
01:09:34,542 --> 01:09:37,158
Who...

855
01:09:37,375 --> 01:09:39,036
Who are you?

856
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,036
See you later at the festival.

857
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:56,865
Let's meet at the shrine.

858
01:09:57,083 --> 01:09:58,083
Don't be late. Bye!

859
01:09:58,292 --> 01:10:00,283
See you. Later.

860
01:10:01,417 --> 01:10:03,123
Don't go!

861
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:05,745
Get out of town. Tell your friends!

862
01:10:05,958 --> 01:10:07,038
What are you saying?

863
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:09,206
Mitsuha! What was that?

864
01:10:09,208 --> 01:10:10,823
Let's go. What was that?

865
01:10:11,042 --> 01:10:13,624
What are you doing?

866
01:10:13,833 --> 01:10:15,539
Could mitsuha...

867
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:19,618
Could she have persuaded them?
Is it my fault?

868
01:10:19,833 --> 01:10:23,746
Yotsuha, leave town
with grandma before nightfall.

869
01:10:23,958 --> 01:10:25,448
You'll die if you stay here!

870
01:10:25,667 --> 01:10:27,532
What are you saying?

871
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:32,665
Yesterday you suddenly went to Tokyo.
What's wrong with you?

872
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,285
Tokyo?

873
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:38,458
Hey, mitsuhal!

874
01:10:40,375 --> 01:10:42,832
How did it go with your old man?

875
01:10:44,625 --> 01:10:46,616
Hey, mitsuha?

876
01:10:46,833 --> 01:10:48,118
What's wrong with her?

877
01:10:48,333 --> 01:10:49,914
No idea.

878
01:10:59,542 --> 01:11:01,908
Are you there?

879
01:11:02,125 --> 01:11:04,582
Is something over there?

880
01:11:04,792 --> 01:11:06,123
Let me use your bike.

881
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:07,333
Hey, what the...

882
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:08,956
Hey, mitsuhal!

883
01:11:09,958 --> 01:11:11,118
What about our plan?

884
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:13,540
Get ready as planned!

885
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:15,456
Please!

886
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,413
I'm taki again.

887
01:11:47,125 --> 01:11:49,992
What's taki doing here?

888
01:11:59,083 --> 01:12:00,823
The town...

889
01:12:01,042 --> 01:12:02,828
Is gone.

890
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:16,076
At that moment... did I...

891
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:20,874
Die?

892
01:12:30,083 --> 01:12:33,780
Taki. Taki.

893
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:38,082
Don't you remember me?

894
01:12:49,792 --> 01:12:51,657
I'm going to Tokyo.

895
01:12:51,875 --> 01:12:53,411
What? Now?

896
01:12:53,625 --> 01:12:54,990
Why?

897
01:12:55,208 --> 01:12:56,208
A date.

898
01:12:56,417 --> 01:12:58,453
You have a boyfriend in Tokyo?

899
01:12:58,667 --> 01:13:01,158
Not my date.

900
01:13:02,125 --> 01:13:04,161
I'll come home tonight.

901
01:13:06,792 --> 01:13:12,082
If I suddenly showed up,
would I bother him? Surprise him?

902
01:13:12,292 --> 01:13:15,329
He might not like it.

903
01:13:22,625 --> 01:13:26,163
The phone you are trying to reach
is out of range or...

904
01:13:26,375 --> 01:13:28,206
There's no way we could meet.

905
01:13:28,417 --> 01:13:31,159
But what if we did?

906
01:13:31,375 --> 01:13:35,948
What should I do? Would I annoy him?
Would it be awkward?

907
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:36,287
"Tiamat makes closest approach tomorrow" what should
I do? Would I annoy him? Would it be awkward?

908
01:13:36,292 --> 01:13:36,496
"Tiamat makes
closest approach tomorrow"

909
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,957
"tiamat makes
closest approach tomorrow"

910
01:13:38,958 --> 01:13:39,322
or maybe...

911
01:13:39,542 --> 01:13:43,285
He'd be a bit glad to see me?

912
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:48,244
The phone you are trying to reach
is out of range or...

913
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:51,746
There's no way we could meet.

914
01:13:51,958 --> 01:13:53,368
But...

915
01:13:54,667 --> 01:13:57,864
One thing is certain.

916
01:13:58,083 --> 01:14:02,656
If we see each other, we'll know.

917
01:14:02,875 --> 01:14:06,868
That you were the one who was inside me.

918
01:14:07,083 --> 01:14:10,041
That I was the one who was inside you.

919
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:11,865
I'm sorry.

920
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,161
Excuse me.

921
01:15:16,708 --> 01:15:21,452
That time three years ago,
before I got to know you...

922
01:15:24,542 --> 01:15:26,749
Taki.

923
01:15:26,958 --> 01:15:30,030
Taki.

924
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:31,660
Taki.

925
01:15:32,625 --> 01:15:36,743
Um... it's me.

926
01:15:36,958 --> 01:15:40,371
Don't you remember me?

927
01:15:40,583 --> 01:15:42,574
Who are you?

928
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:48,657
I'm sorry.

929
01:15:55,833 --> 01:15:58,245
But he's taki.

930
01:15:58,458 --> 01:16:00,494
Weird girl.

931
01:16:09,208 --> 01:16:11,164
Hey!

932
01:16:11,375 --> 01:16:13,206
What's your name?

933
01:16:13,417 --> 01:16:14,748
Mitsuha!

934
01:16:14,958 --> 01:16:18,030
My name is mitsuha!

935
01:16:24,458 --> 01:16:29,907
That time three years ago, you came...

936
01:16:30,125 --> 01:16:32,241
To see me!

937
01:16:42,875 --> 01:16:44,661
Taki?

938
01:16:52,458 --> 01:16:55,370
Mitsuha!

939
01:16:55,583 --> 01:16:57,198
Taki?

940
01:17:11,167 --> 01:17:13,078
Mitsuha!

941
01:17:13,292 --> 01:17:17,410
You're here, aren't you? Inside my body!

942
01:17:17,625 --> 01:17:19,411
Taki!

943
01:17:19,625 --> 01:17:22,207
Taki, where are you?

944
01:17:22,417 --> 01:17:23,782
It's mitsuha.

945
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,707
I can hear her, but...

946
01:17:26,917 --> 01:17:30,080
Taki, where are you?

947
01:17:30,292 --> 01:17:32,032
Taki!

948
01:17:44,542 --> 01:17:47,909
Taki, are you...

949
01:17:48,125 --> 01:17:49,956
There?

950
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:16,457
It's twilight.

951
01:18:31,042 --> 01:18:32,703
Mitsuha.

952
01:18:38,542 --> 01:18:40,908
Taki.

953
01:18:41,125 --> 01:18:45,368
Taki. It's really you.

954
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:49,750
Taki!

955
01:18:49,875 --> 01:18:52,161
I came to see you.

956
01:18:52,375 --> 01:18:56,243
It wasn't easy.
You were so far away.

957
01:18:56,458 --> 01:19:01,202
But how? At that moment, I...

958
01:19:01,417 --> 01:19:04,489
I drank your kuchikamizake.

959
01:19:07,875 --> 01:19:10,947
You drank that?

960
01:19:11,167 --> 01:19:13,158
You idiot! Pervert!

961
01:19:13,375 --> 01:19:16,208
Oh, yeah, and you touched my boobs!

962
01:19:16,417 --> 01:19:18,282
How do you know that?

963
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,081
Yotsuha saw it.

964
01:19:20,292 --> 01:19:23,864
Oh! Sorry, I couldn't help it!
It was just once.

965
01:19:24,083 --> 01:19:26,074
Just once?

966
01:19:27,792 --> 01:19:30,124
Doesn't matter how many times! Jerk.

967
01:19:30,333 --> 01:19:31,573
Sorry.

968
01:19:31,792 --> 01:19:34,204
Oh, this...

969
01:19:34,417 --> 01:19:38,706
Oh. Really, why'd you
come see me before I knew you?

970
01:19:38,917 --> 01:19:40,748
There's no way I'd recognize you.

971
01:19:40,958 --> 01:19:45,327
Here. I kept it for three years.

972
01:19:45,542 --> 01:19:48,614
Now you keep it.

973
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:50,243
Yes.

974
01:19:57,833 --> 01:19:59,448
How is it?

975
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:01,740
Not bad.

976
01:20:01,958 --> 01:20:02,993
You're lying!

977
01:20:03,208 --> 01:20:05,574
No, I... sorry.

978
01:20:05,792 --> 01:20:08,374
You're just so...!

979
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,948
Mitsuha, you still
have things to do. Listen.

980
01:20:27,792 --> 01:20:29,157
It's coming.

981
01:20:29,375 --> 01:20:31,661
Don't worry. You've still got time.

982
01:20:31,875 --> 01:20:35,914
Yes, I'll try.

983
01:20:36,125 --> 01:20:38,286
Kataware-doki is almost...

984
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,990
Over.

985
01:20:41,792 --> 01:20:45,990
Hey, mitsuha. So we don't
forget when we wake up...

986
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:53,947
Let's write our names on each other. Here.

987
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:56,827
Okay!

988
01:21:05,958 --> 01:21:09,246
Mitsuha?

989
01:21:09,458 --> 01:21:11,744
Hey, mitsuha?

990
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:23,413
I wanted to tell you.

991
01:21:23,625 --> 01:21:29,416
Wherever you are in the world,
I'll come find you.

992
01:21:32,167 --> 01:21:35,955
Your name is mitsuha.

993
01:21:36,167 --> 01:21:38,453
It's okay. I remember.

994
01:21:38,667 --> 01:21:42,410
Mitsuha. Mitsuha. Mitsuha.
Your name is mitsuha.

995
01:21:42,625 --> 01:21:44,991
Your name is...

996
01:21:54,583 --> 01:21:58,531
Who are you?

997
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,538
Why did I come here?

998
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:06,913
I came here to see her.

999
01:22:07,125 --> 01:22:11,198
To save her. I wanted her to be alive.

1000
01:22:11,417 --> 01:22:16,332
Who was it? Who? Who did I come to see?

1001
01:22:16,542 --> 01:22:20,581
Someone dear to me. I don't
want to forget. I shouldn't forget!

1002
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:26,540
Who? Who? Who? Who?

1003
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:28,786
What's your name?

1004
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:46,617
Taki. Taki. Taki.

1005
01:22:46,833 --> 01:22:50,906
It's okay. I remember. I'll never forget!

1006
01:22:51,125 --> 01:22:53,366
Taki. Taki.

1007
01:22:53,583 --> 01:22:56,996
Your name is taki!

1008
01:23:06,458 --> 01:23:08,449
"Itomori substation"

1009
01:23:10,875 --> 01:23:12,411
Tessie!

1010
01:23:12,625 --> 01:23:15,116
Mitsuha! Where've you been?

1011
01:23:15,333 --> 01:23:17,449
He said sorry for breaking your bike.

1012
01:23:17,667 --> 01:23:20,784
[Huh? Who did? I did.

1013
01:23:21,792 --> 01:23:24,499
Explain everything to me later.

1014
01:23:28,292 --> 01:23:30,783
That's going to fall? Really?

1015
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,116
Yes! Saw it with my own eyes!

1016
01:23:33,333 --> 01:23:35,790
What? You saw it, huh?

1017
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:41,825
Then I guess we got no choice.
Now we're both criminals!

1018
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:42,830
"Broadcasting room"

1019
01:23:42,833 --> 01:23:44,243
ee

1020
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:45,660
What? I really have to do it?

1021
01:23:45,875 --> 01:23:52,326
When the town's power goes out,
the equipment there should work on backup.

1022
01:23:52,542 --> 01:23:55,579
Please, Sayaka!
Repeat it as much as you can!

1023
01:23:55,792 --> 01:23:58,454
Woo-hoo! You can do it!

1024
01:23:58,667 --> 01:24:01,409
Oh, to heck with it!

1025
01:24:08,083 --> 01:24:11,405
Soon, you think? I have no idea!

1026
01:24:21,208 --> 01:24:22,914
What was that? What's that sound?

1027
01:24:23,125 --> 01:24:24,581
Hey, look!

1028
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:52,115
Hey, look!

1029
01:25:01,333 --> 01:25:05,201
This is itomori town hall.

1030
01:25:05,417 --> 01:25:09,535
An explosion
has occurred at the substation.

1031
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:13,993
There is a danger of further
explosions and forest fires.

1032
01:25:14,208 --> 01:25:20,784
Residents in the following areas,
please evacuate to itomori high school.

1033
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:25,664
Kadoiri district, sakagami district...

1034
01:25:25,875 --> 01:25:28,947
The broadcast isn't from here?
Who is it, then?

1035
01:25:29,167 --> 01:25:31,954
Miyamori district...

1036
01:25:32,167 --> 01:25:34,783
Oyazawa district...

1037
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,956
Let's go, mitsuhal!

1038
01:25:38,167 --> 01:25:39,577
Tessie!

1039
01:25:45,917 --> 01:25:48,078
Run, everybody! Forest fire!

1040
01:25:48,292 --> 01:25:51,125
Forest fire! Please evacuate!

1041
01:25:51,333 --> 01:25:52,333
Run! Fire!

1042
01:25:52,417 --> 01:25:55,955
It's not safe here! Please evacuate!

1043
01:25:56,750 --> 01:26:00,038
We don't have enough time! Mitsuha!

1044
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:02,990
What's wrong?

1045
01:26:03,208 --> 01:26:07,952
His name... I can't remember his name!

1046
01:26:09,875 --> 01:26:13,743
Look, how should I know?
You started all this!

1047
01:26:13,958 --> 01:26:16,916
We can't evacuate
everyone by ourselves!

1048
01:26:17,125 --> 01:26:19,958
Go persuade your father!

1049
01:26:27,792 --> 01:26:31,489
Everybody run! Go to the high school!

1050
01:26:33,667 --> 01:26:35,783
Oh, mitsuha.

1051
01:26:38,375 --> 01:26:41,492
It's no terrorist attack!
What's chubu electric saying?

1052
01:26:41,708 --> 01:26:43,198
They're still checking!

1053
01:26:43,417 --> 01:26:46,614
No forest fire yet? Are you sure?

1054
01:26:46,833 --> 01:26:48,243
Okay!

1055
01:26:49,167 --> 01:26:53,035
Stop this broadcast!
Figure out where it's coming from!

1056
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:56,663
The takayama sensor station called!

1057
01:26:56,875 --> 01:26:58,615
The high school?

1058
01:26:58,833 --> 01:27:04,624
Again, residents in the following areas,
evacuate to itomori high sch... oh!

1059
01:27:04,833 --> 01:27:07,950
What are you doing? Turn that off!

1060
01:27:09,625 --> 01:27:10,625
Sayaka!

1061
01:27:10,708 --> 01:27:12,539
Oh, no.

1062
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:18,207
What have you done, Sayaka?

1063
01:27:21,583 --> 01:27:25,496
This is itomori town hall.

1064
01:27:25,708 --> 01:27:29,656
We are currently looking into the accident.

1065
01:27:29,875 --> 01:27:34,744
Please don't panic. Stay where you are
and await further instructions.

1066
01:27:34,958 --> 01:27:36,573
Stay put, they said.

1067
01:27:36,792 --> 01:27:39,829
What's going on? So we stay put?

1068
01:27:40,042 --> 01:27:44,991
Come on, you should all evacuate!
The high school is the shelter!

1069
01:27:45,208 --> 01:27:46,698
Katsuhiko!

1070
01:27:49,583 --> 01:27:52,416
What are you doing?

1071
01:27:55,208 --> 01:27:57,915
Sorry, mitsuha.

1072
01:27:58,125 --> 01:28:00,116
It's over.

1073
01:28:01,833 --> 01:28:05,746
It really is splitting apart!

1074
01:28:11,958 --> 01:28:13,494
Look at that! - Wow!

1075
01:28:13,708 --> 01:28:16,620
Look! The comet has split in two

1076
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:18,448
and meteors are falling!

1077
01:28:18,667 --> 01:28:21,204
Nobody predicted this.

1078
01:28:21,417 --> 01:28:22,897
We have a really mystical sight here.

1079
01:28:23,083 --> 01:28:24,823
So the comet's nucleus split?

1080
01:28:25,042 --> 01:28:26,202
Did tidal forces affect...

1081
01:28:26,417 --> 01:28:31,161
The comet isn't within the roche limit,
so the nucleus itself must have...

1082
01:28:31,375 --> 01:28:36,699
In the past, comet shoemaker-Levy 9
broke and collided with Jupiter in 1994.

1083
01:28:36,917 --> 01:28:38,202
At least 21 fragments...

1084
01:28:38,417 --> 01:28:40,829
I'm going to go look!

1085
01:28:41,042 --> 01:28:44,534
They will probably melt
before reaching the ground

1086
01:28:44,750 --> 01:28:48,868
and the probability of a meteor crashing
into a residential area is small...

1087
01:28:49,083 --> 01:28:50,573
To predict the trajectory...

1088
01:28:50,792 --> 01:28:54,080
To be witnessing such
a magnificent celestial event, and...

1089
01:28:54,292 --> 01:28:56,954
How fortunate it is

1090
01:28:57,167 --> 01:29:02,161
that those of us living in this
day and age are watching this live.

1091
01:29:04,167 --> 01:29:07,739
Hey. Who are you?

1092
01:29:11,333 --> 01:29:13,494
Who? Who?

1093
01:29:13,708 --> 01:29:15,369
Who is that?

1094
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:20,953
Someone dear to me. I shouldn't forget.
I didn't want to forget!

1095
01:29:21,833 --> 01:29:26,497
Who? Who? Who are you?

1096
01:29:26,708 --> 01:29:28,699
What's your name?

1097
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:37,081
It's split!

1098
01:29:56,083 --> 01:30:01,578
So we don't forget when we wake up,
let's write our names on each other.

1099
01:30:09,667 --> 01:30:13,114
"I love you"

1100
01:30:28,125 --> 01:30:33,245
I can't remember your name with this...

1101
01:30:45,917 --> 01:30:47,407
Dad!

1102
01:30:49,208 --> 01:30:51,164
Mitsuha! Mitsuha!

1103
01:30:51,375 --> 01:30:53,457
Not you again...

1104
01:30:57,208 --> 01:31:00,780
It was almost as if
it were a scene from a dream.

1105
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:05,414
Nothing more, nothing less
than a beautiful view.

1106
01:32:36,458 --> 01:32:43,364
What am I doing here?

1107
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:18,288
I'm always searching for something.

1108
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:22,789
This feeling has
possessed me for some time.

1109
01:33:24,417 --> 01:33:26,248
I applied because...

1110
01:33:26,458 --> 01:33:27,868
The landscapes people live in...

1111
01:33:28,083 --> 01:33:29,869
To build a city's landscape...

1112
01:33:30,083 --> 01:33:33,951
You never know when Tokyo
might disappear as well.

1113
01:33:34,167 --> 01:33:40,538
So I want to help build landscapes
that leave heartwarming memories...

1114
01:33:42,458 --> 01:33:44,574
How many interviews have you had?

1115
01:33:44,792 --> 01:33:45,792
I haven't kept track.

1116
01:33:45,958 --> 01:33:48,244
Can't see you landing a job.
Thanks a lot!

1117
01:33:48,458 --> 01:33:49,994
Maybe it's the suit.

1118
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:51,914
We're not that different!

1119
01:33:52,125 --> 01:33:54,616
1 have two job offers.
1 have eight.

1120
01:33:57,917 --> 01:34:00,033
"Line: You have a new message."

1121
01:34:00,042 --> 01:34:01,782
"Line: You have a new message."

1122
01:34:01,792 --> 01:34:05,785
Even I'm not sure if I'm searching
for a person or a place,

1123
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:12,075
or if I'm just searching for a job.

1124
01:34:12,292 --> 01:34:14,453
Oh, you're job-hunting.

1125
01:34:14,667 --> 01:34:16,828
I haven't had much luck.

1126
01:34:17,583 --> 01:34:19,414
Maybe it's the suit.

1127
01:34:19,625 --> 01:34:21,991
Does it look that bad?

1128
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:28,536
What brings you here today?

1129
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:33,790
I was out here for work
and figured I'd say hi.

1134
01:34:40,292 --> 01:34:44,240
You were still in high school, so it was...

1135
01:34:44,458 --> 01:34:46,915
Five years ago. That long?

1136
01:34:47,125 --> 01:34:51,118
Seems like I've forgotten a lot.

1137
01:34:51,333 --> 01:34:56,782
I, too, no longer remember
much from back then.

1138
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:02,120
Maybe we had a disagreement; The other
two returned to Tokyo without me.

1139
01:35:02,333 --> 01:35:05,780
I spent the night alone on some mountain.

1140
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,956
That's about all I remember.

1141
01:35:10,250 --> 01:35:13,538
But at one point, I was inexplicably drawn

1142
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:17,413
to the events surrounding that comet.

1143
01:35:19,208 --> 01:35:23,121

it's nice for a change to break your habit

1235
01:43:36,583 --> 01:43:41,748
especially when you are next to me

1236
01:43:41,958 --> 01:43:47,407
just a bit more, a little bit more,

1237
01:43:47,625 --> 01:43:53,120
would you...

1238
01:43:53,333 --> 01:43:58,873
Just a bit more, a little bit more,

1239
01:43:59,083 --> 01:44:03,281
stick together

1240
01:44:07,917 --> 01:44:12,832
we are time-flyer, I knew who you are

1241
01:44:13,042 --> 01:44:21,042
long before even I learned my name

1242
01:44:25,917 --> 01:44:31,037
there must be a meaning
to the world without you

1243
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:37,120
but the world without you
is like August with no summer break

1244
01:44:37,333 --> 01:44:42,828
like Santa claus with no ho-ho-ho's

1245
01:44:43,042 --> 01:44:51,042
how pitiful if such were the world

1246
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:21,369
We are time-flyer, we are time-climber

1247
01:45:21,583 --> 01:45:28,159
don't wanna be lost in its hide-and-seek

1248
01:45:28,375 --> 01:45:32,493
it's really nothing,
yeah it's really nothing

1249
01:45:32,708 --> 01:45:37,031
I'm on my way

1250
01:45:37,250 --> 01:45:42,119
we are time-flyer, we are time-climber

1251
01:45:42,333 --> 01:45:48,579
don't wanna be lost in its hide-and-seek

1252
01:45:48,792 --> 01:45:53,536
you're a loud cryer, wish I could stop ya

1253
01:45:53,750 --> 01:46:00,371
but when I saw your tears
I knew I was refused

1254
01:46:00,583 --> 01:46:04,451
I cry when I'm happy
I laugh when I'm sad

1255
01:46:04,667 --> 01:46:09,957
because my heart overtook me
