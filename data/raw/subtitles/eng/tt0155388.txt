1
00:01:50,633 --> 00:01:51,861
How do you do, sir?

2
00:01:52,073 --> 00:01:54,985
-Lovely sermon this morning.
-How are you today?

3
00:01:57,393 --> 00:01:58,951
Come on, Father.

4
00:01:59,873 --> 00:02:01,022
He's a good man.

5
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:02,222
Sorry, Arthur?

6
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:04,151
Good man, good sermon.

7
00:02:07,793 --> 00:02:10,182
Pharaoh's dream of the King of Egypt.

8
00:02:10,433 --> 00:02:13,266
Seven fat years, seven lean years.
Good sermon.

9
00:02:13,473 --> 00:02:15,668
-Exceptional sermon.
-I couldn't hear him.

10
00:02:15,873 --> 00:02:19,582
-Can one be good and inaudible?
-A problem in ethics for you, Father.

11
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:22,586
-Not everything is ethics.
-And the seven fat cows...

12
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:25,827
...were devoured by the seven
lean and hungry cows.

13
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:28,149
I feel like those lean
and hungry cows.

14
00:02:28,353 --> 00:02:29,422
My point precisely.

15
00:02:29,673 --> 00:02:31,106
Lunch in about an hour, sir.

16
00:02:31,753 --> 00:02:33,266
My, it's going to rain.

17
00:02:33,473 --> 00:02:36,431
I could've told you that.
I feel it in my leg.

18
00:02:37,193 --> 00:02:40,549
-Would you mind the gramophone?
-The centre of a well-regulated home.

19
00:02:40,753 --> 00:02:42,550
It helps me concentrate.

20
00:02:42,753 --> 00:02:45,551
Concentrate on what, pray? Catherine?

21
00:02:45,793 --> 00:02:47,590
It's all right, Father.

22
00:02:48,473 --> 00:02:50,509
-I wanted to see about--
-To study.

23
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,152
-To study.
-What did you say?

24
00:02:52,353 --> 00:02:56,505
I said the gramophone, the music of
the gramophone helps me to study.

25
00:02:57,073 --> 00:03:01,544
Study is not what you were involved
in when I came downstairs last night.

26
00:03:01,793 --> 00:03:03,624
-Your friend and you.
-Edwina, Father.

27
00:03:03,873 --> 00:03:05,784
Edwina had just stopped by to--

28
00:03:05,993 --> 00:03:08,746
She stopped by on the way
from Graham's for a book.

29
00:03:08,953 --> 00:03:12,548
And you are involved with her
in what? A sort of what?

30
00:03:12,753 --> 00:03:14,584
Reading club?

31
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:26,870
I must say I believe I have a right
to a certain measure of autonomy.

32
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,472
Sorry, what were we discussing?

33
00:03:28,713 --> 00:03:29,828
Edwina.

34
00:03:30,673 --> 00:03:32,789
What a fast and flighty little--

35
00:03:34,353 --> 00:03:36,184
I'm sorry. You're keen on her.

36
00:03:36,393 --> 00:03:38,543
You would've had ample proof, Grace...

37
00:03:38,753 --> 00:03:41,187
...if you'd seen their
attitude last night.

38
00:03:41,433 --> 00:03:43,993
-We were practising the bunny hug.
-The what, dear?

39
00:03:44,193 --> 00:03:46,423
-Is that what it's called?
-A new dance.

40
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:49,306
It's like the turkey trot,
only more dignified.

41
00:03:49,553 --> 00:03:50,986
Good sermon, miss?

42
00:03:51,193 --> 00:03:52,945
Joseph interprets Pharaoh's dreams.

43
00:03:53,153 --> 00:03:56,463
More like the fox trot.
Fox trot or the kangaroo glide.

44
00:03:56,873 --> 00:03:58,670
Whichever animal is responsible...

45
00:03:58,873 --> 00:04:02,183
...for the posture I found you
and your friend in last night--

46
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,232
Or to make an end...

47
00:04:05,753 --> 00:04:06,868
...l doubt...

48
00:04:08,473 --> 00:04:12,591
...l doubt the gramophone aids you
in what you call your studies.

49
00:04:16,193 --> 00:04:19,981
-I see. It all comes clear to me.
-Yes, it's raining.

50
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:21,986
May I see it?

51
00:04:23,113 --> 00:04:26,071
It's not about the gramophone.
It's about Ronnie.

52
00:04:26,313 --> 00:04:29,430
I wouldn't have thought it of you.
I certainly would not.

53
00:04:29,633 --> 00:04:30,952
And at this festive season.

54
00:04:31,153 --> 00:04:35,032
At this festive season, to throw
it up to me, to bring that up again.

55
00:04:35,273 --> 00:04:37,184
-Nobody's bringing that up.
-They are.

56
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:41,312
Ronnie got into Osbourne, as I did not.

57
00:04:41,593 --> 00:04:44,426
Why? As he applies himself.

58
00:04:44,673 --> 00:04:45,469
And Ronnie--

59
00:04:45,713 --> 00:04:48,102
Dickie, do you have a coin
to give the fellow?

60
00:04:48,353 --> 00:04:51,504
No, sir, I have not.
And if I may, I'm going to my room.

61
00:04:51,753 --> 00:04:54,392
I might suggest you take
that gramophone with you.

62
00:04:54,593 --> 00:04:55,787
May I ask why?

63
00:04:55,993 --> 00:04:58,382
Because it's out of place
in a civilized home.

64
00:04:58,593 --> 00:05:00,584
We'll take up the matter after lunch.

65
00:05:00,793 --> 00:05:01,589
I know.

66
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,393
I don't think I've ever
seen a nicer setting.

67
00:05:04,593 --> 00:05:06,788
Yes, it was. Isn't it lovely?

68
00:05:07,673 --> 00:05:08,947
Pelting down out there.

69
00:05:09,353 --> 00:05:10,342
What, dear?

70
00:05:10,593 --> 00:05:12,265
It's raining.
What are you reading?

71
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:14,185
Len Rogers' memoirs.

72
00:05:14,393 --> 00:05:16,987
-Who was Len Rogers?
-He was a trades union leader.

73
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,109
Was he a radical?

74
00:05:18,353 --> 00:05:20,264
Yes, I'd say so.

75
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,748
Does John know of your
political beliefs?

76
00:05:22,993 --> 00:05:25,632
-And he still wants to marry you?
-Seems to.

77
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:29,628
I've asked John to come early for lunch.

78
00:05:31,593 --> 00:05:33,663
-What?
-He's coming early for lunch.

79
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:39,590
You won't forbid the match, will you?
lf you do, I shall elope.

80
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:40,629
Never fear...

81
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:45,389
...l'm too delighted at the prospect
of getting you off our hands at last.

82
00:05:45,593 --> 00:05:47,231
Does Desmond know, by the way?

83
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:49,464
I'm not sure I like that "at last."

84
00:05:49,673 --> 00:05:51,629
Have you told Desmond yet?

85
00:05:51,873 --> 00:05:52,988
Do you love him?

86
00:05:54,193 --> 00:05:56,070
John? Yes, I do.

87
00:05:56,313 --> 00:05:58,907
Do you? You don't behave
as if you're in love.

88
00:05:59,153 --> 00:06:01,223
How does one behave
as if one is in love?

89
00:06:01,473 --> 00:06:04,431
One doesn't read
The Social Evil and the Social Good.

90
00:06:04,673 --> 00:06:06,311
One reads Lord Byron.

91
00:06:06,553 --> 00:06:08,111
Is that so? I see.

92
00:06:08,353 --> 00:06:11,823
I don't think you modern girls
have the feelings our generation did.

93
00:06:12,073 --> 00:06:15,349
Very well. I love John in every
way a woman can love a man.

94
00:06:15,553 --> 00:06:17,271
Does that satisfy you?

95
00:06:17,473 --> 00:06:18,792
My, look at the rain.

96
00:06:22,153 --> 00:06:24,428
I thought I saw someone in the garden.

97
00:06:24,673 --> 00:06:25,469
Where?

98
00:06:25,673 --> 00:06:26,947
Over there. Do you see?

99
00:06:27,193 --> 00:06:30,185
Whoever it is
is getting terribly wet.

100
00:06:30,393 --> 00:06:31,621
-Is that John?
-Sounded like it.

101
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,391
Quick, into the drawing room.

102
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:36,193
All right. Good. Here we go.

103
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:37,502
You forgot your bag.

104
00:06:37,753 --> 00:06:39,345
What on earth's going on?

105
00:06:39,593 --> 00:06:42,505
We'll leave you with John.
When finished, cough or something.

106
00:06:42,753 --> 00:06:44,425
What do you mean, "or something"?

107
00:06:44,873 --> 00:06:48,388
Knock three times with your stick,
and then we'll come in.

108
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:52,593
You don't think it'll look
a trifle coincidental?

109
00:06:59,233 --> 00:07:00,985
Mr. Watherstone.

110
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:05,144
-How are you?
-Hello, sir.

111
00:07:05,353 --> 00:07:07,184
Have you got a coin?

112
00:07:09,353 --> 00:07:10,342
Here.

113
00:07:11,273 --> 00:07:14,583
Thank Mr. Simms for
delivering on a Sunday, will you?

114
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:17,191
Glad you could come.

115
00:07:17,393 --> 00:07:19,031
I see you have your tree.

116
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,389
Fellow just put it up for us.

117
00:07:22,193 --> 00:07:24,184
-How are you, sir?
-Oh, fine.

118
00:07:24,633 --> 00:07:26,589
This arthritis is troubling me a bit.

119
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:28,545
Catherine told me it was better.

120
00:07:28,753 --> 00:07:30,789
Yes. It was better.

121
00:07:31,193 --> 00:07:32,672
Now it's worse.

122
00:07:52,273 --> 00:07:54,503
I understand you wish
to marry my daughter.

123
00:07:54,753 --> 00:07:55,902
Yes, sir.

124
00:07:56,193 --> 00:07:59,071
That is, I proposed to her
and she's accepted me.

125
00:07:59,273 --> 00:08:00,103
I see.

126
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:05,068
I trust that your second statement
wasn't a denial of your first.

127
00:08:05,273 --> 00:08:07,946
-You do really wish to marry her?
-Yes, of course, sir.

128
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,462
Why "of course"? There are plenty
who don't wish to marry her.

129
00:08:12,673 --> 00:08:14,470
"Of course," because I proposed.

130
00:08:14,713 --> 00:08:18,672
That too doesn't necessarily follow.
However, we don't need to quibble.

131
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,262
We'll take the sentimental
side for granted.

132
00:08:49,953 --> 00:08:54,424
As to the practical side, I hope you
won't mind some personal questions.

133
00:08:54,673 --> 00:08:56,072
No, sir. It's your duty.

134
00:08:56,273 --> 00:08:57,547
Quite so.

135
00:08:57,753 --> 00:08:59,948
Your income. Are you able
to live on it?

136
00:09:00,193 --> 00:09:01,945
No, I'm in the regular army.

137
00:09:02,153 --> 00:09:04,792
But my pay is supplemented
by an allowance.

138
00:09:04,993 --> 00:09:05,903
So I understand.

139
00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:09,190
-Your pay would be about L24 a month?
-That's right.

140
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:11,947
Your total income with your
subaltern's pay...

141
00:09:12,153 --> 00:09:15,828
...plus the allowance from your father
would be about L420 a year?

142
00:09:16,073 --> 00:09:17,586
Again, exactly the figure.

143
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:22,145
It seems perfectly satisfactory.
I needn't delay my congratulations.

144
00:09:22,473 --> 00:09:23,986
Thank you, sir.

145
00:09:24,393 --> 00:09:26,384
-Do you smoke?
-I do.

146
00:09:26,753 --> 00:09:30,632
I propose to settle on my daughter
one-sixth of my total capital.

147
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:35,702
Which, to the final fraction, is
L833, six shillings and eight pence.

148
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:40,589
But let's deal in round figures,
shall we, and call it L850.

149
00:09:40,793 --> 00:09:42,226
I call that very generous, sir.

150
00:09:42,473 --> 00:09:46,068
It's not as generous as I'd have
liked, but if it seems agreeable...

151
00:09:46,273 --> 00:09:48,741
...l don't think we have
any more to discuss.

152
00:09:48,953 --> 00:09:51,387
-No, sir.
-Splendid.

153
00:09:58,753 --> 00:10:00,789
Pretty rotten weather, isn't it, sir?

154
00:10:01,473 --> 00:10:03,384
Yes, vile.

155
00:10:15,313 --> 00:10:16,109
Cigarette?

156
00:10:16,353 --> 00:10:19,390
No, thank you, sir.
I'm still smoking.

157
00:10:24,353 --> 00:10:25,149
Well?

158
00:10:25,473 --> 00:10:26,349
Well, what?

159
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:27,708
How was your little chat?

160
00:10:27,953 --> 00:10:30,592
You weren't supposed to know
we were having a chat.

161
00:10:31,753 --> 00:10:34,267
You're infuriating.
Is everything all right, John?

162
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,472
-I'm glad. I really am.
-Thank you, Mrs. Winslow.

163
00:10:37,713 --> 00:10:38,782
-Can I kiss you?
-Yes.

164
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:41,422
Well, I'm practically your mother now.

165
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:44,551
I'm practically your father,
but if you'll forgive me....

166
00:10:46,473 --> 00:10:49,192
He's gone and left
the garden gate open.

167
00:10:53,193 --> 00:10:55,707
Could someone close
the garden gate for us?

168
00:10:55,953 --> 00:10:58,626
I don't suppose you'd mind
if we left you alone?

169
00:10:58,873 --> 00:11:02,707
I think we might allow ourselves
a modest celebration at lunch.

170
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,591
Would you get me the cellar key?

171
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:08,189
Violet, would you have someone
see to the gate, please?

172
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,152
Was it an ordeal?

173
00:11:30,353 --> 00:11:32,423
-Scared to death.
-My poor darling.

174
00:11:39,273 --> 00:11:43,789
I had a lot of neatly turned phrases,
but he wouldn't let me use them.

175
00:11:43,993 --> 00:11:46,507
-I'm sure they were good.
-I thought they were.

176
00:11:46,753 --> 00:11:48,106
Want to do your speech for me?

177
00:11:48,353 --> 00:11:51,584
Love to. What is it?

178
00:12:00,393 --> 00:12:01,462
Ronnie, what is it?

179
00:12:02,273 --> 00:12:04,582
Where did Father go? ls he gone?

180
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,152
I'll go and get him.

181
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:11,667
No, don't go and get him.
No! Cate, please don't.

182
00:12:12,873 --> 00:12:15,785
-Please, Cate, don't.
-What's the trouble, Ronnie?

183
00:12:16,273 --> 00:12:18,389
You'd better go
and change, hadn't you?

184
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:21,223
What's the trouble?
You can tell me.

185
00:12:21,473 --> 00:12:24,226
You know John Watherstone.
You met him last holidays.

186
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:26,185
I'll disappear.

187
00:12:31,193 --> 00:12:32,945
Now, darling, what is it?

188
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:35,064
You can tell me. Have you run away?

189
00:12:35,793 --> 00:12:37,192
What is it then?

190
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:49,263
Oh, God!

191
00:12:49,473 --> 00:12:51,464
I didn't do it.
Really, I didn't.

192
00:12:51,673 --> 00:12:52,662
No, darling.

193
00:12:52,993 --> 00:12:55,791
This letter's addressed to Father.
Did you open it?

194
00:12:56,033 --> 00:12:57,102
You shouldn't have.

195
00:12:57,473 --> 00:12:59,589
I was going to tear it up.

196
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:02,711
We could tell Father term
had ended two days sooner.

197
00:13:02,953 --> 00:13:06,025
-I'm back for Christmas holidays--
-No, darling.

198
00:13:06,273 --> 00:13:08,662
I didn't do it. Really, I didn't.

199
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:13,547
Ronnie, old lad, how's everything?
Back early?

200
00:13:13,753 --> 00:13:16,790
-Take him upstairs. I'll get Mother.
-All right.

201
00:13:17,273 --> 00:13:18,388
What's up then, old chap?

202
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:19,992
Nothing.

203
00:13:25,553 --> 00:13:26,668
Have you been sacked?

204
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:28,786
Bad luck. What for?

205
00:13:28,993 --> 00:13:31,188
-I didn't do it.
-Of course not. I know.

206
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,349
-Honestly. I didn't.
-That's all right.

207
00:13:33,593 --> 00:13:35,424
I believe you.
No need to go on.

208
00:13:35,673 --> 00:13:37,072
I say, you're a bit damp.

209
00:13:37,313 --> 00:13:39,781
-I've been in the rain.
-You're shivering too.

210
00:13:39,993 --> 00:13:42,826
Ought you to change?
Don't want you catching pneumonia.

211
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,301
I'm all right.

212
00:13:44,553 --> 00:13:47,386
-Mother.
-There, darling.

213
00:13:47,913 --> 00:13:48,902
There, there.

214
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,266
All right now.

215
00:13:51,473 --> 00:13:54,670
-I didn't do it, Mother.
-No, darling, of course you didn't.

216
00:13:54,873 --> 00:13:57,228
Let's get out of these wet things.

217
00:13:57,433 --> 00:14:00,823
-Don't tell Father.
-No, darling. Not yet. I promise.

218
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:03,587
A new uniform too. What a shame.

219
00:14:03,993 --> 00:14:06,587
All right, Ronnie. It's all right.

220
00:14:08,873 --> 00:14:09,828
Bad news?

221
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:13,624
-Expelled?
-That's right.

222
00:14:13,873 --> 00:14:15,101
What's he done?

223
00:14:15,873 --> 00:14:17,864
He's supposed to have....

224
00:14:20,753 --> 00:14:24,063
Just think what he's been going
through these last 1 0 days.

225
00:14:24,273 --> 00:14:26,343
It seems pretty heartless, I admit.

226
00:14:27,553 --> 00:14:29,544
You must remember, darling...

227
00:14:30,993 --> 00:14:34,508
...he's not really at school.
He is in the services.

228
00:14:34,753 --> 00:14:35,868
What's the difference?

229
00:14:36,113 --> 00:14:39,344
Their ways may seem brutal,
but they are always fair.

230
00:14:39,553 --> 00:14:42,704
Must have been a full inquiry
before taking this step.

231
00:14:43,273 --> 00:14:45,184
If there's been a 1 0-day delay...

232
00:14:45,393 --> 00:14:48,590
...it was to give the boy
a better chance to clear himself.

233
00:14:49,393 --> 00:14:52,544
I'm awfully sorry.
How will your father take it?

234
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:56,343
It might kill him. We've got
Desmond to lunch. I forgot.

235
00:14:56,553 --> 00:14:58,305
Desmond Curry, our family solicitor.

236
00:14:58,513 --> 00:15:01,107
Oh, Lord! Darling, be polite
to him, won't you?

237
00:15:01,353 --> 00:15:02,502
Am I usually rude?

238
00:15:02,753 --> 00:15:04,345
-He doesn't know about us.
-Who does?

239
00:15:04,553 --> 00:15:08,068
But he's been in love with me for
years. It's a family joke.

240
00:15:11,473 --> 00:15:14,146
Desmond, I don't think you
know John Watherstone.

241
00:15:14,393 --> 00:15:16,031
I've heard a lot about him.

242
00:15:16,273 --> 00:15:18,070
-How do you do?
-Well, well, well.

243
00:15:18,673 --> 00:15:19,822
I trust I'm not early?

244
00:15:20,073 --> 00:15:21,552
No. Punctual as always.

245
00:15:21,753 --> 00:15:23,505
Capital. Good.

246
00:15:25,793 --> 00:15:27,351
No, I'm sorry. Please.

247
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,868
I was wondering
how your shoulder was.

248
00:15:30,073 --> 00:15:31,904
Not very well.
The damp, you know.

249
00:15:32,153 --> 00:15:34,462
-Sorry to hear that.
-Old cricket injury.

250
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:38,030
Well, it seems I'm to
congratulate you both.

251
00:15:38,273 --> 00:15:41,788
Violet told me at the door.
Yes, I must congratulate you both.

252
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:43,751
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

253
00:15:43,953 --> 00:15:45,864
Of course, it's quite expected, I know.

254
00:15:46,073 --> 00:15:49,110
Still it was rather a surprise,
hearing it from Violet that way.

255
00:15:49,353 --> 00:15:52,390
We were going to tell you.
It was official this morning.

256
00:15:52,633 --> 00:15:55,431
-You're the first to hear it.
-Am l? Am I indeed?

257
00:15:55,673 --> 00:15:57,026
I see you've got your tree.

258
00:15:57,753 --> 00:16:00,984
-Hello, Mrs. Winslow.
-Hello, Desmond, dear.

259
00:16:01,873 --> 00:16:03,511
I've got him to bed.

260
00:16:03,753 --> 00:16:05,186
Nobody ill, I hope?

261
00:16:06,193 --> 00:16:08,423
Hello, Desmond.
You're not looking well.

262
00:16:08,673 --> 00:16:09,947
The old cricket thing.

263
00:16:10,153 --> 00:16:13,031
Any relation of D.W.H. Curry?
Played for Middlesex.

264
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:14,547
I am D.W.H. Curry.

265
00:16:14,793 --> 00:16:16,112
-Curry of Curry's match?
-Yes.

266
00:16:16,353 --> 00:16:18,423
Hat trick against the Players
in what year?

267
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:19,668
1 895 at Lord's.

268
00:16:19,873 --> 00:16:22,307
-You were a hero of mine.
-Was l? Was I indeed?

269
00:16:22,873 --> 00:16:25,626
I used to have a signed
photograph of you.

270
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:29,183
I used to sign a lot once,
for schoolboys.

271
00:16:30,873 --> 00:16:34,468
I think we might try a little
of the Madeira before luncheon.

272
00:16:34,673 --> 00:16:36,311
We're celebrating--

273
00:16:36,793 --> 00:16:38,431
It's all right. Desmond knows.

274
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:39,463
Yes, indeed.

275
00:16:39,713 --> 00:16:44,264
It's wonderful news, isn't it?
I'll gladly drink a toast to the....

276
00:16:44,553 --> 00:16:47,590
" Happy pair," I think is the phrase
that's eluding you.

277
00:16:47,793 --> 00:16:51,627
As a matter of fact, I was looking
for something new to say.

278
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:55,303
A forlorn quest, my dear Desmond.
A forlorn quest.

279
00:16:55,513 --> 00:16:57,868
Arthur, you mustn't be so rude.

280
00:16:58,113 --> 00:17:00,468
I meant, naturally, that nobody...

281
00:17:00,673 --> 00:17:03,790
...with the possible exception
of Voltaire...

282
00:17:03,993 --> 00:17:07,383
...could find anything new to say
about an engaged couple.

283
00:17:08,073 --> 00:17:09,984
Dickie! A toast to the happy pair.

284
00:17:10,193 --> 00:17:12,104
Is that all finally spliced up?

285
00:17:12,313 --> 00:17:16,147
Cate definitely being entered for
the marriage stakes? Good egg!

286
00:17:16,673 --> 00:17:17,662
Quite so.

287
00:17:17,873 --> 00:17:21,661
I should've added, "with the exception
of Voltaire and Dickie Winslow."

288
00:17:21,913 --> 00:17:24,427
Are we allowed to drink
to our own healths?

289
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:26,191
-It's permissible.
-It's bad luck.

290
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:29,226
-We defy augury, don't we?
-You mustn't say that.

291
00:17:29,473 --> 00:17:32,067
I know. You can drink
each other's healths.

292
00:17:32,873 --> 00:17:33,669
So...

293
00:17:33,913 --> 00:17:36,985
...our superstitious terrors
are allayed, are they?

294
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:38,429
Good.

295
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:39,986
Catherine...

296
00:17:40,633 --> 00:17:41,986
...and John.

297
00:17:42,753 --> 00:17:44,903
Violet! We mustn't leave you out.

298
00:17:45,153 --> 00:17:47,508
-You must join us.
-Nothing for me, sir.

299
00:17:47,753 --> 00:17:52,065
You'd be more convincing if you
hadn't brought an extra glass.

300
00:17:52,313 --> 00:17:54,781
Not for myself, sir.
It's for Master Ronnie.

301
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,785
You brought a glass for Ronnie?

302
00:17:57,473 --> 00:17:58,986
I thought you'd
allow him a taste.

303
00:17:59,193 --> 00:18:01,309
To drink the toast.
He's so grown-up.

304
00:18:01,553 --> 00:18:04,704
But Master Ronnie doesn't get
back from Osbourne until Tuesday.

305
00:18:04,953 --> 00:18:06,306
He's back. The girl said.

306
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:08,623
The holidays don't start till Tuesday.

307
00:18:09,273 --> 00:18:11,912
The girl saw him.
Isn't that right, ma'am?

308
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:21,101
Grace, what does this mean?

309
00:18:21,673 --> 00:18:23,425
All right, Violet, you can go.

310
00:18:23,673 --> 00:18:24,992
Yes, miss.

311
00:18:27,593 --> 00:18:29,982
Catherine, did you know
Ronnie was back?

312
00:18:33,753 --> 00:18:36,028
-Dickie?
-Yes, Father.

313
00:18:36,273 --> 00:18:37,592
Grace?

314
00:18:38,273 --> 00:18:42,585
We thought you shouldn't know, Arthur.
Just for the time being.

315
00:18:45,273 --> 00:18:47,582
Is the boy very ill?

316
00:18:51,593 --> 00:18:53,584
Answer me, someone.

317
00:18:54,953 --> 00:18:56,784
Is the boy very ill?

318
00:18:57,593 --> 00:18:59,584
No, Father, he's not ill.

319
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:04,426
Will someone tell me
what has happened, please?

320
00:19:15,593 --> 00:19:18,391
He brought this letter for you, Arthur.

321
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:23,465
Will you read it to me, please?

322
00:19:23,713 --> 00:19:24,589
Not in front of--

323
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,789
Will you read it to me, please?

324
00:19:36,073 --> 00:19:39,861
"Sir, I am commanded by my Lords'
Commissioners of the Admiralty...

325
00:19:40,433 --> 00:19:43,664
...to inform you of a communication
from the Commanding Officer...

326
00:19:43,873 --> 00:19:45,670
...of the Royal Naval College...

327
00:19:45,873 --> 00:19:50,185
...reporting the theft of a 5-shilling
postal order at the college...

328
00:19:50,393 --> 00:19:52,827
...which was cashed at
the Post Office.

329
00:19:53,073 --> 00:19:57,828
Investigation of the case leaves
no other conclusion possible...

330
00:19:58,153 --> 00:20:03,068
...than that the order was cashed by
your son, Cadet Ronald Arthur Winslow.

331
00:20:04,073 --> 00:20:06,746
My Lords regret that
they must request you...

332
00:20:06,953 --> 00:20:09,387
...to withdraw your son
from the college.

333
00:20:09,593 --> 00:20:12,153
I am, sir, your obedient servant."

334
00:20:12,673 --> 00:20:14,584
It's signed by....

335
00:20:15,873 --> 00:20:18,103
I can't read his name.

336
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:36,391
Would you be kind enough to have
Ronnie come down and see me, please?

337
00:20:36,593 --> 00:20:38,584
-He's in bed.
-You told me he wasn't ill.

338
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,061
He's not at all well.

339
00:20:40,313 --> 00:20:41,462
Thank you, Desmond.

340
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:44,949
The rest of you go into luncheon.
Take them in, please.

341
00:20:45,433 --> 00:20:46,627
Arthur, don't you think--?

342
00:20:46,873 --> 00:20:50,991
Would you decant the claret?
You'll find it in the dining room.

343
00:20:51,193 --> 00:20:52,990
-Yes, Father.
-Thank you.

344
00:20:55,593 --> 00:20:57,311
Please don't....

345
00:20:57,713 --> 00:20:59,226
Please don't....

346
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,184
What mustn't I do?

347
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:05,993
Please don't forget he's only a child.

348
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,591
Come on, Mother.

349
00:21:11,193 --> 00:21:13,582
Come on, darling. It's all right.

350
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:27,991
Come in!

351
00:21:31,073 --> 00:21:32,984
Come in and close the door.

352
00:21:37,473 --> 00:21:39,191
Come over here.

353
00:21:45,273 --> 00:21:46,706
Why aren't you in uniform?

354
00:21:46,953 --> 00:21:48,989
It got wet.

355
00:21:49,193 --> 00:21:51,024
How did it get wet?

356
00:21:51,273 --> 00:21:54,868
-I was out in the garden in the rain.
-Why?

357
00:21:55,873 --> 00:21:57,192
I was hiding.

358
00:21:57,393 --> 00:21:59,031
From me?

359
00:22:00,873 --> 00:22:02,352
Remember you promised me...

360
00:22:02,553 --> 00:22:05,863
...if you got into trouble
you'd come to me first?

361
00:22:06,353 --> 00:22:09,470
Why didn't you come to me?
Why did you hide in the garden?

362
00:22:09,673 --> 00:22:12,585
-I don't know, Father.
-Are you so frightened of me?

363
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:18,991
It says in this letter that
you stole a postal order.

364
00:22:20,233 --> 00:22:23,942
I don't want you to speak until you've
heard what I have to say first.

365
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:27,828
If you did it, you must tell me.

366
00:22:28,073 --> 00:22:31,622
I shan't be angry with you, Ronnie,
provided you tell me the truth.

367
00:22:32,033 --> 00:22:34,183
But if you lie, I shall know it.

368
00:22:34,393 --> 00:22:37,066
Because a lie between you
and me cannot be hidden.

369
00:22:37,353 --> 00:22:39,184
I shall know it, Ronnie.

370
00:22:40,073 --> 00:22:42,382
So remember that before you speak.

371
00:22:44,633 --> 00:22:46,783
Did you steal this postal order?

372
00:22:47,473 --> 00:22:49,782
No, Father, I didn't.

373
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:53,188
Did you steal this postal order?

374
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:56,382
No, Father, I didn't.

375
00:22:59,273 --> 00:23:01,184
Go on back to bed.

376
00:23:30,433 --> 00:23:34,984
"The efforts of Mr. Arthur Winslow to
secure a fair trial for his son...

377
00:23:35,233 --> 00:23:38,862
...having been thwarted at every
turn by a soulless oligarchy.... "

378
00:23:39,113 --> 00:23:41,069
"Soulless oligarchy."
That's rather good.

379
00:23:41,273 --> 00:23:45,266
" It is high time private and peaceful
citizens of this country woke to...

380
00:23:45,473 --> 00:23:48,226
...the increasing encroachment
of their freedoms."

381
00:23:48,473 --> 00:23:49,701
Tell me a piece of news.

382
00:23:49,953 --> 00:23:53,662
I tell you news. A chap
on the train had on brown boots.

383
00:23:53,873 --> 00:23:55,625
Brown boots, I ask you!

384
00:23:55,873 --> 00:23:57,591
-Did he wear a brown suit?
-No excuse.

385
00:23:57,793 --> 00:24:00,512
-Can you get this out?
-I'm going to the law library.

386
00:24:00,753 --> 00:24:03,392
Polly, do you think you
can get this out?

387
00:24:03,593 --> 00:24:05,584
-Fighting on many fronts?
-That's right.

388
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:08,631
Cannon to the right of you and so on?
Paying you yet?

389
00:24:08,873 --> 00:24:11,068
I just do it for the sport
of the thing.

390
00:24:11,273 --> 00:24:13,229
The other's from " Perplexed."

391
00:24:13,433 --> 00:24:16,231
"With the troubles in the
Balkans and the inquiry...

392
00:24:16,473 --> 00:24:21,103
...at which the judge confirmed
the findings that the boy was guilty...

393
00:24:21,873 --> 00:24:24,467
...this correspondence now must cease."

394
00:24:27,353 --> 00:24:30,390
In any case, it'll blow over
before the wedding.

395
00:24:31,273 --> 00:24:33,264
-Postponed again?
-His father's out of town.

396
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:36,943
Nothing wrong? I won't have to
quirt him with my riding crop?

397
00:24:37,193 --> 00:24:39,388
"This correspondence now must cease."

398
00:24:39,633 --> 00:24:42,193
Well, I'm late for a meeting
with the guv.

399
00:24:59,753 --> 00:25:04,190
What would one of your bookmaker
friends lay in the way of odds...

400
00:25:04,433 --> 00:25:05,786
...of your getting a degree?

401
00:25:06,473 --> 00:25:08,589
Well, let's think.
Say about evens?

402
00:25:10,673 --> 00:25:13,665
I doubt whether your friend
would find many takers.

403
00:25:13,873 --> 00:25:15,192
Well, perhaps 7-to-4 against.

404
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:18,345
And the odds against
your becoming a civil servant?

405
00:25:18,553 --> 00:25:21,670
-A bit steeper.
-Exactly. Quite a bit steeper.

406
00:25:21,873 --> 00:25:23,750
You don't want a bet, do you?

407
00:25:23,953 --> 00:25:26,421
No, Dickie, I'm not a gambler.

408
00:25:26,993 --> 00:25:28,824
And that is exactly the trouble.

409
00:25:30,753 --> 00:25:34,223
Unhappily, I'm no longer in a position
to gamble L200 a year...

410
00:25:34,473 --> 00:25:36,703
...on what you admit
is an outside chance.

411
00:25:36,913 --> 00:25:38,631
It's the case, I suppose.

412
00:25:38,953 --> 00:25:40,511
You want me to leave Oxford?

413
00:25:40,993 --> 00:25:42,221
I'm afraid so.

414
00:25:43,033 --> 00:25:45,467
-Straightaway?
-No, finish your year.

415
00:25:45,673 --> 00:25:46,469
And then what?

416
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:48,510
I can get you a job at the bank.

417
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,192
Oh, Lord.

418
00:25:50,553 --> 00:25:52,305
It'd be quite a good job.

419
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:55,351
My influence here still
counts for something.

420
00:25:57,393 --> 00:26:00,226
Father, if I promised you,
really promised you....

421
00:26:00,473 --> 00:26:02,270
I'm afraid my mind is made up.

422
00:26:02,633 --> 00:26:04,191
Oh, Lord.

423
00:26:04,393 --> 00:26:07,669
-This is a shock for you.
-What? No. It isn't, really.

424
00:26:07,873 --> 00:26:11,991
I've been rather expecting it, as a
matter of fact. Things are tight.

425
00:26:12,193 --> 00:26:12,989
Yes, they're tight.

426
00:26:13,233 --> 00:26:17,351
And you're still hoping
to brief Sir Robert Morton?

427
00:26:17,593 --> 00:26:18,662
Yes, we're hoping.

428
00:26:18,913 --> 00:26:21,586
-That'd take a bit of tin.
-Yes, it will.

429
00:26:23,433 --> 00:26:26,789
Still, I can't say but that it
isn't a bit of a slap in the face.

430
00:26:27,033 --> 00:26:31,106
I thank you for bearing what must be
an unpleasant blow with some fortitude.

431
00:26:31,873 --> 00:26:33,784
Nonsense, Father.

432
00:27:03,953 --> 00:27:08,583
Miss Barnes from The Beacon to see
Arthur Winslow. I have an appointment.

433
00:27:10,033 --> 00:27:13,992
-What a lovely home you have.
-It's showing its age a bit, but....

434
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:18,587
My paper usually sends me out on
stories that are of interest to women.

435
00:27:18,873 --> 00:27:21,751
Stories with a little heart,
you know, like this one.

436
00:27:21,993 --> 00:27:23,711
A father's fight for his
boy's honour.

437
00:27:24,273 --> 00:27:27,583
I think the case has rather
wider implications than that.

438
00:27:27,793 --> 00:27:29,112
Yes, of course.

439
00:27:29,353 --> 00:27:32,823
What I'd like is to get a nice
picture of you and your boy.

440
00:27:33,073 --> 00:27:36,827
My son's arriving from school soon.
His mother's gone to meet him.

441
00:27:37,033 --> 00:27:39,467
From school? How interesting.

442
00:27:39,673 --> 00:27:43,632
So you got a school to take him?
They didn't mind the unpleasantness?

443
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:46,188
Not at all, not at all.
No question of that.

444
00:27:46,393 --> 00:27:50,227
I found it extraordinary
how fair-minded people are.

445
00:27:50,433 --> 00:27:52,389
Yes, indeed.

446
00:27:52,753 --> 00:27:54,630
And why is he coming back this time?

447
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:58,303
He's not being expelled again,
if that was your implication.

448
00:27:58,553 --> 00:28:01,431
-He's doing quite well at school.
-Good.

449
00:28:01,673 --> 00:28:04,585
Extraordinarily well,
considering the circumstances.

450
00:28:04,793 --> 00:28:05,942
Why is he coming back?

451
00:28:06,193 --> 00:28:10,232
He's coming to London to be
examined by Sir Robert Morton.

452
00:28:10,473 --> 00:28:13,783
Robert Morton? Do you think
he'll take a little case like this?

453
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:17,872
-This is not a little case, madam.
-Of course not.

454
00:28:18,713 --> 00:28:22,672
Of course not. It's not a little
case. Nothing of the sort.

455
00:28:25,233 --> 00:28:29,545
Now, perhaps you wouldn't
mind giving me a few details.

456
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:31,385
When did it all start?

457
00:28:31,593 --> 00:28:32,946
Four months ago.

458
00:28:34,873 --> 00:28:38,183
I knew of the charge when
my son arrived with a letter...

459
00:28:38,393 --> 00:28:40,145
...informing me of his expulsion.

460
00:28:40,393 --> 00:28:41,985
I phoned Osbourne to protest...

461
00:28:42,193 --> 00:28:45,390
...and I was referred by them to
the Lords of the Admiralty.

462
00:28:45,633 --> 00:28:48,101
My solicitors then took the matter up.

463
00:28:48,553 --> 00:28:51,784
We applied for a court-martial.
They ignored us.

464
00:28:52,273 --> 00:28:54,912
We applied for a civil trial,
they ignored us again.

465
00:28:55,153 --> 00:28:58,190
And after tremendous pressure,
letters to the papers...

466
00:28:58,393 --> 00:29:01,146
...questions in the House
and by other means...

467
00:29:01,393 --> 00:29:02,792
...to private citizens...

468
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:06,508
...the Admiralty eventually agreed
to an independent inquiry.

469
00:29:06,713 --> 00:29:08,783
-Good.
-It was not good, madam.

470
00:29:08,993 --> 00:29:13,305
At that independent inquiry, conducted
by the judge advocate of the fleet...

471
00:29:13,553 --> 00:29:17,990
...against whom I'm saying nothing,
my son, a child of 1 4...

472
00:29:18,193 --> 00:29:21,629
...was not represented by counsel,
solicitors or friends.

473
00:29:21,873 --> 00:29:23,545
What happened at that inquiry?

474
00:29:23,793 --> 00:29:27,468
What do you think? lnevitably,
he was found guilty again...

475
00:29:27,793 --> 00:29:32,309
...and branded a second time before
the world as a thief and a forger.

476
00:29:32,673 --> 00:29:34,026
What a shame.

477
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:37,788
I need hardly tell you, I will not
let the matter rest there.

478
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:41,423
I intend to fight this monstrous
injustice with every weapon...

479
00:29:41,673 --> 00:29:44,107
...and every power at my disposal.

480
00:29:44,433 --> 00:29:45,786
And I have a plan.

481
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:49,827
I've approached Sir Robert--
I have petitioned Sir Robert Morton--

482
00:29:50,073 --> 00:29:53,509
What charming curtains.
What are they made of?

483
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:58,392
Madam, I fear I have no idea.

484
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:02,791
-Is that the poor little chap?
-Hello, Ronnie!

485
00:30:03,873 --> 00:30:07,309
I say, Mr. Moore says
I needn't come back until Monday.

486
00:30:07,513 --> 00:30:09,549
So that gives me three whole days.

487
00:30:10,033 --> 00:30:11,352
How are you, my boy?

488
00:30:11,593 --> 00:30:14,391
I'm tops, Father.
Mother says I've grown an inch.

489
00:30:14,633 --> 00:30:15,668
That's the lad!

490
00:30:15,873 --> 00:30:17,226
That's the lad.

491
00:30:17,473 --> 00:30:19,623
That's the lad we need a picture of.

492
00:30:20,353 --> 00:30:22,309
You want to take it outside?

493
00:30:22,553 --> 00:30:24,544
I only mention it as the light's going.

494
00:30:24,873 --> 00:30:25,862
Might we go to the park?

495
00:30:26,113 --> 00:30:29,105
I was thinking we'd go to the park.
Do you think?

496
00:30:29,313 --> 00:30:30,666
You could wear your uniform.

497
00:30:31,033 --> 00:30:33,183
I don't think that
would be a good idea.

498
00:30:33,433 --> 00:30:36,869
Something to stress his youth.
Do you have cricket clothes?

499
00:30:37,193 --> 00:30:40,742
This lady's from The Beacon.
She's interested in your curtains.

500
00:30:40,993 --> 00:30:42,267
Really? How nice.

501
00:30:42,513 --> 00:30:45,107
Indeed. I was wondering
what they were made of.

502
00:30:45,353 --> 00:30:47,662
-Which?
-In the drawing room.

503
00:30:47,913 --> 00:30:52,509
They're an entirely new material. I'm
afraid I don't know what it's called.

504
00:30:52,713 --> 00:30:55,830
I got it in Barker's last year.

505
00:30:56,033 --> 00:30:58,183
It's a mixture of silk and velvet.

506
00:30:58,433 --> 00:31:01,345
-We're losing the light.
-If we could, do you see...

507
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:05,552
...put him in cricket costume? It
would say both "youth" and " England."

508
00:31:05,753 --> 00:31:07,391
-Oh, very well.
-I'll set up.

509
00:31:07,593 --> 00:31:08,628
Yes, you set up.

510
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:12,382
Goodbye. Very best of good
fortune in your inspiring fight.

511
00:31:12,593 --> 00:31:15,551
It was very good of you to talk to me.

512
00:31:15,753 --> 00:31:18,506
-I've found the name of the material.
-Excellent.

513
00:31:18,753 --> 00:31:20,948
Excellent. Marvellous.

514
00:31:21,153 --> 00:31:22,905
-That's very kind of you.
-Not at all.

515
00:31:23,273 --> 00:31:25,662
Ronnie, we'll meet you in the park.

516
00:31:31,113 --> 00:31:33,069
What's she talking about?

517
00:31:33,273 --> 00:31:35,946
-The case, I imagine.
-Oh, the case.

518
00:31:36,153 --> 00:31:39,065
Father, did you know
the train had 1 4 coaches?

519
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:40,103
Had it really?

520
00:31:40,353 --> 00:31:43,265
-Yes, all corridor.
-Remarkable.

521
00:31:44,073 --> 00:31:46,541
I've had your half-term report, Ronnie.

522
00:31:47,033 --> 00:31:50,105
-On the whole, it was pretty fair.
-Good.

523
00:31:50,313 --> 00:31:52,827
I'm glad you seem to be
settling down so well.

524
00:31:53,033 --> 00:31:56,787
Yes, thank you, Father.
Do you know how long the train took?

525
00:31:56,993 --> 00:31:59,712
1 23 miles in 2 hours and 52 minutes.

526
00:31:59,953 --> 00:32:04,105
That's an average of 46.73 miles
an hour. I worked it out.

527
00:32:04,313 --> 00:32:07,828
You worked it out well. You
better change for the photographer.

528
00:32:08,033 --> 00:32:10,149
-Violet's out.
-Tell her I'm back?

529
00:32:10,393 --> 00:32:12,463
Yes. Now you need to go and change.

530
00:32:30,233 --> 00:32:33,430
I found a new citation
in the law library.

531
00:32:33,633 --> 00:32:35,703
-Ronnie's back.
-What?

532
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:37,671
I said, Ronnie's back.

533
00:32:41,073 --> 00:32:41,983
New frock?

534
00:32:42,233 --> 00:32:44,349
Bless you, I've turned the cuffs.

535
00:32:44,553 --> 00:32:47,067
-Turned the cuffs?
-What?

536
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:50,664
No, I said I like the frock.

537
00:32:50,913 --> 00:32:52,505
-Like it?
-Yes, I do.

538
00:32:52,713 --> 00:32:54,669
I hope John likes it.

539
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:56,308
What are you reading?

540
00:32:56,713 --> 00:33:00,501
Admiralty law. New citation:
" Cadet's right to a first hearing."

541
00:33:00,713 --> 00:33:01,748
Did John telephone?

542
00:33:01,993 --> 00:33:03,904
Things are all right between you?

543
00:33:04,153 --> 00:33:07,828
-Of course, everything's perfect.
-Good, good.

544
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:09,665
Couldn't be better.

545
00:33:10,913 --> 00:33:12,471
Good.

546
00:33:23,713 --> 00:33:26,068
Are we both mad, you and l?

547
00:33:26,473 --> 00:33:27,872
Tell me.

548
00:33:28,913 --> 00:33:31,063
Should we drop the whole thing?

549
00:33:32,953 --> 00:33:35,865
I don't consider that
a serious question.

550
00:33:36,153 --> 00:33:39,270
You realize your marriage
settlement will have to go?

551
00:33:39,513 --> 00:33:42,425
Of course. I gave that up
for lost weeks ago.

552
00:33:42,633 --> 00:33:44,464
It won't make any difference?

553
00:33:44,673 --> 00:33:46,072
Good heavens, no.

554
00:33:46,913 --> 00:33:48,266
All right.

555
00:33:48,753 --> 00:33:51,950
Let us pin our faith
on the appearance of a champion.

556
00:33:53,353 --> 00:33:57,312
You know what I think of Robert Morton.
Don't let's go into that again.

557
00:33:57,553 --> 00:33:58,668
I want the best.

558
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:01,108
The best in this case is not Morton.

559
00:34:01,353 --> 00:34:04,982
-Why does everyone say he is?
-Why does everyone vote for slavery?

560
00:34:05,433 --> 00:34:09,870
He's the best if one happens to be a
large monopoly attacking a trade union.

561
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:12,664
Then he's your lad.

562
00:34:12,913 --> 00:34:14,585
Yes, indeed he is.

563
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:19,309
-Did Mr. Watherstone telephone?
-I just stepped out.

564
00:34:19,553 --> 00:34:21,862
To the best of my knowledge,
no one's phoned.

565
00:34:23,313 --> 00:34:25,907
If his heart isn't in it,
he won't accept the brief.

566
00:34:26,153 --> 00:34:28,542
He might. It depends
what's in it for him.

567
00:34:29,153 --> 00:34:30,711
Luckily, there isn't much.

568
00:34:30,913 --> 00:34:32,710
There's a substantial check.

569
00:34:32,953 --> 00:34:35,421
He doesn't want money.
He must be very rich.

570
00:34:35,633 --> 00:34:38,386
-What does he want?
-To advance his interests.

571
00:34:38,633 --> 00:34:41,943
You're prejudiced because he
spoke against women's suffrage.

572
00:34:42,153 --> 00:34:44,223
Is that a prejudice or a position?

573
00:34:44,433 --> 00:34:45,422
You tell me.

574
00:34:45,673 --> 00:34:49,222
It's a position. He's always
speaking against what is right.

575
00:34:49,553 --> 00:34:50,463
Mr. Curry, miss.

576
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,465
Mr. Curry.

577
00:34:57,433 --> 00:35:00,072
Hello, Desmond. Yes.

578
00:35:00,513 --> 00:35:02,469
What? Wait.

579
00:35:02,673 --> 00:35:06,268
What? Violet, did we receive
a letter from Mr. Curry?

580
00:35:06,473 --> 00:35:08,031
Yes, I just--

581
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:11,071
Now? Yes, right.
Thank you. Yes.

582
00:35:13,433 --> 00:35:14,752
What is it, my dear?

583
00:35:17,753 --> 00:35:19,505
Violet, hail us a cab.

584
00:35:19,913 --> 00:35:21,426
-Where's Ronnie?
-In the park.

585
00:35:21,633 --> 00:35:25,512
We'll go without him. Desmond got
us an appointment with Sir Robert.

586
00:35:25,753 --> 00:35:26,549
When?

587
00:35:26,873 --> 00:35:28,625
Half an hour ago.

588
00:35:58,113 --> 00:36:00,911
-We only have a few moments.
-We didn't get your note.

589
00:36:01,113 --> 00:36:04,867
He has a most important
dinner engagement, sir.

590
00:36:05,073 --> 00:36:06,062
Where's the boy?

591
00:36:06,313 --> 00:36:08,463
He'll be along with my wife soon.

592
00:36:08,673 --> 00:36:12,143
-He can only spare us very few moments.
-We're conscious of it.

593
00:36:12,353 --> 00:36:13,866
You'd better go on ahead.

594
00:36:14,113 --> 00:36:18,072
Explain why we're late.
Make our apologies. Go now.

595
00:36:22,073 --> 00:36:25,827
It's straight through that doorway,
up the stairs and to your left.

596
00:36:49,433 --> 00:36:52,072
Miss Catherine Winslow.
The Winslow case.

597
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:55,063
-We understood that--
-They're coming.

598
00:36:55,473 --> 00:36:56,986
They're coming?

599
00:36:57,433 --> 00:36:59,549
We didn't hear
of the appointment until--

600
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:02,063
Miss Catherine Winslow.

601
00:37:03,953 --> 00:37:05,671
I beg your pardon.

602
00:37:08,153 --> 00:37:11,748
I suppose you know the history
of this case, Sir Robert?

603
00:37:12,153 --> 00:37:15,270
I believe I've seen most of
the relevant documents.

604
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:18,069
Yes, excellent.

605
00:37:19,073 --> 00:37:22,827
Do you think we can bring the case
into court by a collusive action?

606
00:37:23,073 --> 00:37:24,870
I really have no idea.

607
00:37:25,953 --> 00:37:28,342
Curry and Curry seem to think
that might hold.

608
00:37:28,593 --> 00:37:32,063
Do they? They are a very
reliable firm.

609
00:37:36,353 --> 00:37:37,468
Robert Morton.

610
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:39,504
Catherine Winslow.

611
00:37:40,993 --> 00:37:43,382
Mr. Michaels, if I could
have your attention.

612
00:37:43,633 --> 00:37:45,066
Yes, sir.

613
00:37:47,353 --> 00:37:48,468
You don't mind if l...?

614
00:37:48,713 --> 00:37:52,501
What's more absurd than your asking
permission to smoke in your office?

615
00:37:52,753 --> 00:37:55,267
-It's just the custom.
-I indulge, myself.

616
00:37:55,513 --> 00:37:56,502
Indeed?

617
00:37:56,753 --> 00:37:58,232
Some find that shocking.

618
00:37:59,353 --> 00:38:02,425
Amazing how little it takes
to offend the world.

619
00:38:02,633 --> 00:38:04,271
No, thank you.

620
00:38:05,953 --> 00:38:09,468
My father and brother will be here.
What time are you dining?

621
00:38:10,353 --> 00:38:11,342
Eight o'clock.

622
00:38:11,593 --> 00:38:12,821
Far from here?

623
00:38:13,073 --> 00:38:14,426
Devonshire House.

624
00:38:14,673 --> 00:38:16,345
Then you mustn't be late.

625
00:38:19,233 --> 00:38:23,021
I'm rather surprised that a case
of this sort should interest you.

626
00:38:23,313 --> 00:38:24,109
Are you?

627
00:38:24,313 --> 00:38:29,182
It seems such a trivial affair compared
to your great forensic triumphs.

628
00:38:29,553 --> 00:38:34,388
I was in court when you prosecuted
the Trades Union Embezzlement case.

629
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:35,868
Really?

630
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:37,592
Magnificently done.

631
00:38:38,713 --> 00:38:39,543
Thank you.

632
00:38:39,793 --> 00:38:42,705
You heard that he committed
suicide a few months ago?

633
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:44,306
Yes, I had heard.

634
00:38:44,553 --> 00:38:46,862
Many people believed
him innocent, you know.

635
00:38:47,113 --> 00:38:50,344
So I understand. As it happens,
however, he was guilty.

636
00:38:57,273 --> 00:39:00,265
Sir Robert, I am so sorry
to keep you waiting.

637
00:39:01,113 --> 00:39:03,468
I'm so sorry.
We didn't get your note--

638
00:39:03,713 --> 00:39:07,467
-Perfectly all right.
-Sir Robert is due at Devonshire House.

639
00:39:07,993 --> 00:39:10,109
I know that you're pressed
for time, sir.

640
00:39:10,353 --> 00:39:14,665
My son will be along at any moment.
I assume you'll want to examine him.

641
00:39:14,873 --> 00:39:18,468
Just a few questions.
That is all I will have time for.

642
00:39:19,713 --> 00:39:21,192
I'm sorry to hear it.

643
00:39:21,433 --> 00:39:24,345
My son journeyed from school
hoping to be interviewed.

644
00:39:24,593 --> 00:39:26,311
And I hoped, by the end of it...

645
00:39:26,513 --> 00:39:29,664
...l should know definitely whether
you'd accept the brief.

646
00:39:29,873 --> 00:39:31,704
You, of course, understand my anxiety?

647
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:36,708
Perhaps Sir Robert would consent to
finish his examination some other time.

648
00:39:37,153 --> 00:39:38,666
It might be arranged.

649
00:39:38,913 --> 00:39:39,743
Tomorrow?

650
00:39:41,433 --> 00:39:45,745
Tomorrow is impossible. I'm in court
and in the House of Commons all day.

651
00:39:46,073 --> 00:39:47,028
I see.

652
00:39:47,953 --> 00:39:51,104
Curry says it's possible to
proceed by Petition of Right.

653
00:39:51,353 --> 00:39:54,311
-Would you mind if I sat down, sir?
-Please.

654
00:39:54,553 --> 00:39:56,225
What's a Petition of Right?

655
00:39:56,433 --> 00:39:59,869
The assumption that the Admiralty,
as the Crown, can do no wrong--

656
00:40:00,073 --> 00:40:02,587
That was the assumption
we refused to grant.

657
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:03,868
In law, I mean.

658
00:40:04,113 --> 00:40:08,152
A subject can sue the Crown,
nevertheless, by Petition of Right.

659
00:40:08,353 --> 00:40:10,071
Petition of Right, yes.

660
00:40:10,313 --> 00:40:12,543
Redress being granted
as a matter of grace.

661
00:40:12,753 --> 00:40:17,429
And the custom is for the attorney
general, on behalf of the Crown...

662
00:40:17,633 --> 00:40:20,750
...to endorse the petition, allowing
the case to come to court.

663
00:40:21,353 --> 00:40:26,268
It is interesting to note the exact
words he uses on such occasions are:

664
00:40:26,873 --> 00:40:28,352
" Let right be done."

665
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,470
" Let right be done."

666
00:40:30,673 --> 00:40:32,470
I like that phrase, sir.

667
00:40:32,713 --> 00:40:35,102
It has a certain ring about it,
has it not?

668
00:40:35,353 --> 00:40:37,071
" Let right be done."

669
00:40:37,353 --> 00:40:40,663
This is Sir Robert. That's my wife.

670
00:40:41,553 --> 00:40:42,906
This is Ronnie.

671
00:40:43,113 --> 00:40:46,947
Sir Robert will ask you a few
questions, answer truthfully as always.

672
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,747
-I expect you'd like us to leave.
-No.

673
00:40:49,993 --> 00:40:51,984
Provided, of course, you
don't interrupt.

674
00:40:54,353 --> 00:40:56,071
Would you sit down, please?

675
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:12,349
Sorry we're late.

676
00:41:12,593 --> 00:41:15,266
That's all right.
Nothing's happened at all.

677
00:41:16,913 --> 00:41:18,869
Will you stand here facing me?

678
00:41:21,233 --> 00:41:22,871
That's right.

679
00:41:23,953 --> 00:41:26,467
Now, Ronald, how old are you?

680
00:41:26,673 --> 00:41:28,106
Fourteen and two months.

681
00:41:28,353 --> 00:41:32,266
You were then 1 3 and 1 0 months
old when you left Osbourne?

682
00:41:32,473 --> 00:41:33,747
-Is that right?
-Yes, sir.

683
00:41:34,153 --> 00:41:38,066
I would like to cast your mind back
to December 7th of last year.

684
00:41:38,273 --> 00:41:41,868
Tell me in your own words exactly
what happened to you on that day.

685
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:45,864
It was half-holiday, so we didn't
have any work after dinner.

686
00:41:46,073 --> 00:41:50,191
-Dinner at 1 :00?
-Yes, at least until prep at 7:00.

687
00:41:50,433 --> 00:41:52,230
Prep at 7:00.

688
00:41:53,193 --> 00:41:56,230
Just before dinner, I went to
the chief petty officer...

689
00:41:56,433 --> 00:42:00,062
...and asked him for 1 5 and 6 out
of what I had in the school bank.

690
00:42:00,313 --> 00:42:01,143
Why?

691
00:42:01,353 --> 00:42:04,390
-I wanted to buy an air pistol.
-Which cost 1 5 and 6?

692
00:42:04,633 --> 00:42:05,429
Yes, sir.

693
00:42:05,673 --> 00:42:07,903
How much did you
have in the school bank?

694
00:42:08,153 --> 00:42:11,270
-Two pounds, three shillings.
-What incentive could he--?

695
00:42:11,513 --> 00:42:15,028
I must ask you to be good enough
not to interrupt me, sir.

696
00:42:19,553 --> 00:42:23,307
After you had withdrawn the 1 5 and 6,
what did you do?

697
00:42:23,673 --> 00:42:24,822
I had dinner.

698
00:42:25,073 --> 00:42:26,472
Then what?

699
00:42:26,793 --> 00:42:29,910
I went to the locker room and
put my money in my locker.

700
00:42:30,153 --> 00:42:33,509
Then I went to get permission
to go to the post office.

701
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:37,142
Then I went back to the locker room...

702
00:42:37,353 --> 00:42:40,231
...got my money and went down
to the post office.

703
00:42:40,473 --> 00:42:42,065
Yes, go on.

704
00:42:42,873 --> 00:42:45,228
-I bought my postal order.
-For 1 5 and 6?

705
00:42:45,433 --> 00:42:49,745
Yes, sir. Then I went back to college.
Then I met Elliot minor.

706
00:42:49,993 --> 00:42:52,587
He said, " lsn't it rot?
Someone broke into my locker...

707
00:42:52,793 --> 00:42:55,466
...and pinched a postal order.
I've reported it."

708
00:42:55,713 --> 00:42:58,591
And those were Elliot minor's
exact words?

709
00:42:59,073 --> 00:43:01,189
He might have used
another word for " rot."

710
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:04,463
I see. Continue.

711
00:43:05,073 --> 00:43:08,270
Just before prep, I was told
to go see Commander Flower.

712
00:43:08,473 --> 00:43:12,546
The post office woman was there.
The commander said, " ls this the boy?"

713
00:43:12,753 --> 00:43:16,143
She said, " It might be. I can't
be sure, they all look alike."

714
00:43:16,353 --> 00:43:18,309
She couldn't identify him.

715
00:43:19,553 --> 00:43:20,747
Go on.

716
00:43:21,353 --> 00:43:25,471
She said, " I know that the boy who
bought a postal order for 1 5 and 6...

717
00:43:25,713 --> 00:43:28,022
...was the one who cashed one
for 5 shillings."

718
00:43:28,233 --> 00:43:31,703
So the commander said, " Did you buy a
postal order for 1 5 and 6?"

719
00:43:31,913 --> 00:43:33,107
And I said, "Yes."

720
00:43:33,313 --> 00:43:35,031
He made me write Elliot's name...

721
00:43:35,233 --> 00:43:38,145
...and compared it to the signature
on the postal order.

722
00:43:38,353 --> 00:43:42,869
Then 1 0 days later I was sacked.
I mean, expelled.

723
00:43:43,273 --> 00:43:44,467
I see.

724
00:43:45,233 --> 00:43:48,384
Did you cash Elliot minor's
postal order for 5 shillings?

725
00:43:48,633 --> 00:43:49,509
No, sir.

726
00:43:49,753 --> 00:43:51,471
Did you steal it from his locker?

727
00:43:51,753 --> 00:43:52,663
No, sir.

728
00:43:52,913 --> 00:43:56,428
That is the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

729
00:43:56,673 --> 00:43:57,628
Yes, sir.

730
00:43:59,913 --> 00:44:00,709
Right.

731
00:44:03,633 --> 00:44:05,271
The files, please.

732
00:44:06,473 --> 00:44:09,146
This has just come down
from Ridgeley Pierce.

733
00:44:09,353 --> 00:44:10,468
Thank you.

734
00:44:14,753 --> 00:44:17,631
When the commander asked you
to write Elliot's name...

735
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:20,222
...did you write the
Christian name or initials?

736
00:44:20,473 --> 00:44:22,464
I wrote " Charles K. Elliot."

737
00:44:23,113 --> 00:44:26,947
Did you see the forged postal order
in the commander's office?

738
00:44:27,193 --> 00:44:29,502
Yes, sir. The commander
showed it to me.

739
00:44:30,433 --> 00:44:32,549
Before or after you
wrote Elliot's name?

740
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:33,663
After.

741
00:44:34,833 --> 00:44:37,666
Did you see how Elliot's
name was written on it?

742
00:44:37,913 --> 00:44:41,064
-Yes, sir. The same.
-The same.

743
00:44:41,353 --> 00:44:45,312
-Charles K. Elliot.
-Yes.

744
00:44:48,553 --> 00:44:52,148
When you wrote, what made you
choose that particular form?

745
00:44:52,393 --> 00:44:55,305
-That was the way he signed his name.
-How did you know?

746
00:44:55,553 --> 00:44:56,781
He was a great friend.

747
00:44:57,033 --> 00:44:58,625
How did you know?

748
00:44:58,873 --> 00:45:00,591
-I saw him sign things.
-What things?

749
00:45:00,793 --> 00:45:02,021
Ordinary things.

750
00:45:02,273 --> 00:45:03,865
I repeat. What things?

751
00:45:04,513 --> 00:45:05,662
Bits of paper.

752
00:45:05,913 --> 00:45:08,632
Bits of paper? Why did he
sign bits of paper?

753
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:11,706
-He was practising his signature.
-And you saw him?

754
00:45:11,953 --> 00:45:13,227
He knew you saw him?

755
00:45:13,473 --> 00:45:14,303
Well, yes.

756
00:45:14,553 --> 00:45:16,942
He showed you exactly
how he wrote his signature?

757
00:45:17,153 --> 00:45:18,552
Yes, I suppose he did.

758
00:45:19,673 --> 00:45:21,504
Did you practise writing it yourself?

759
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:23,742
I might have.

760
00:45:23,993 --> 00:45:25,790
What do you mean?
Did you or not?

761
00:45:27,793 --> 00:45:29,067
You never told me that.

762
00:45:29,313 --> 00:45:31,907
-It was only a joke.
-Even if it was a joke...

763
00:45:32,153 --> 00:45:34,587
...you practised forging
Elliot's signature.

764
00:45:34,793 --> 00:45:35,589
It wasn't forging.

765
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,391
-What is it then?
-Writing.

766
00:45:37,633 --> 00:45:41,831
Whoever stole and cashed the postal
order also wrote Elliot's signature.

767
00:45:43,233 --> 00:45:47,112
Oddly enough, in the exact form in
which you had practised his signature.

768
00:45:47,353 --> 00:45:49,071
Which side are you on?

769
00:45:51,113 --> 00:45:52,671
Are you aware...

770
00:45:54,113 --> 00:45:58,664
...the Admiralty sent the forged
postal order to Mr. Ridgeley Pierce?

771
00:45:58,873 --> 00:46:01,148
The greatest handwriting
expert in England?

772
00:46:01,393 --> 00:46:03,031
-Yes.
-You're aware of that?

773
00:46:03,273 --> 00:46:05,707
Mr. Ridgeley Pierce affirmed
there was no doubt...

774
00:46:05,953 --> 00:46:08,990
...the signature on the postal order
and the one you wrote...

775
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:11,269
...were by one and the same hand?

776
00:46:12,113 --> 00:46:14,229
You say you didn't
forge that signature?

777
00:46:14,473 --> 00:46:15,303
Yes, I do.

778
00:46:15,553 --> 00:46:17,908
Mr. Ridgeley Pierce
doesn't know his job?

779
00:46:18,153 --> 00:46:19,825
Well, he's wrong, anyway.

780
00:46:20,073 --> 00:46:21,426
Is he indeed?

781
00:46:21,633 --> 00:46:26,548
Are you aware the government has 1 7
examples of your handwriting?

782
00:46:26,913 --> 00:46:29,666
And a board of experts
identified them as identical...

783
00:46:29,873 --> 00:46:32,671
...with the signature
of Charles K. Elliot?

784
00:46:33,873 --> 00:46:36,865
When you went into
the locker room, were you alone?

785
00:46:37,113 --> 00:46:38,705
I don't remember.

786
00:46:38,953 --> 00:46:41,183
I think you do. Were you alone?

787
00:46:42,393 --> 00:46:43,826
You knew Elliot's locker?

788
00:46:44,073 --> 00:46:45,108
Yes, of course.

789
00:46:45,353 --> 00:46:47,913
-Why did you go in there?
-To put my money away.

790
00:46:48,113 --> 00:46:49,546
-Why?
-I thought it safer.

791
00:46:49,753 --> 00:46:50,981
Why safer than your pocket?

792
00:46:51,233 --> 00:46:52,507
I don't know.

793
00:46:53,153 --> 00:46:56,463
What time did Elliot put his
postal order in his locker?

794
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:58,465
I didn't know he had a postal order.

795
00:46:58,713 --> 00:47:00,305
When did you go
to the locker room?

796
00:47:00,553 --> 00:47:01,508
I don't remember.

797
00:47:01,713 --> 00:47:03,465
-Directly after dinner?
-I think so.

798
00:47:03,713 --> 00:47:04,907
What did you do afterwards?

799
00:47:05,153 --> 00:47:07,667
I went to get permission
to go to the post office.

800
00:47:07,913 --> 00:47:09,710
-At what time?
-A quarter past 2.

801
00:47:09,953 --> 00:47:13,150
Dinner was over. You were
in the locker room for 1 l2 an hour.

802
00:47:13,553 --> 00:47:15,430
I wasn't in there all that time.

803
00:47:15,633 --> 00:47:18,352
-How long were you there?
-About five minutes.

804
00:47:18,593 --> 00:47:20,743
-And for the other 25?
-I don't remember.

805
00:47:20,993 --> 00:47:24,542
-Perhaps I was at the C.O.'s office.
-No one saw you there either?

806
00:47:24,753 --> 00:47:27,108
I remember someone did see me there.

807
00:47:27,313 --> 00:47:29,508
A chap called Casey.
I spoke to him.

808
00:47:29,753 --> 00:47:30,822
What did you say?

809
00:47:31,073 --> 00:47:34,065
" Come to the post office with me
to cash a postal order."

810
00:47:37,033 --> 00:47:38,989
" Cash" a postal order?

811
00:47:42,953 --> 00:47:44,272
I mean, get.

812
00:47:44,513 --> 00:47:47,266
You said, "cash."
Why say "cash" if you meant "get"?

813
00:47:48,433 --> 00:47:49,752
I don't know.

814
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:52,109
I suggest "cash" was the truth.

815
00:47:52,353 --> 00:47:53,627
You're muddling me.

816
00:47:53,873 --> 00:47:56,626
You're easily muddled.
How many lies have you told?

817
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:58,067
None. Really, I haven't.

818
00:47:58,313 --> 00:47:59,792
I suggest your testimony's a lie.

819
00:48:00,033 --> 00:48:01,068
No, it's the truth!

820
00:48:01,313 --> 00:48:04,146
I suggest there is barely any
truth in what you said...

821
00:48:04,353 --> 00:48:06,423
...to me, the judge
or the commander.

822
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:10,751
I suggest you broke into Elliot's
locker and stole the postal order.

823
00:48:10,953 --> 00:48:14,104
-You cashed it by forging his name.
-I didn't!

824
00:48:14,353 --> 00:48:17,072
You did it as a joke,
meaning to give the money back.

825
00:48:17,393 --> 00:48:20,669
But when he reported it,
you decided to keep quiet.

826
00:48:20,913 --> 00:48:23,825
It isn't true! It isn't true!

827
00:48:24,433 --> 00:48:25,627
None of it's true!

828
00:48:25,873 --> 00:48:29,388
By denying your guilt, you're
causing hardship to your family...

829
00:48:29,593 --> 00:48:32,346
...and annoyance to important
persons in this country.

830
00:48:32,593 --> 00:48:34,584
That's a disgraceful thing to say.

831
00:48:34,833 --> 00:48:38,348
The time has come for you to undo
the misery you've caused...

832
00:48:38,553 --> 00:48:42,432
...by confessing to us all that you're
a forger, a liar and a thief!

833
00:48:42,673 --> 00:48:45,233
I'm not, I'm not! I didn't do it!

834
00:48:45,473 --> 00:48:46,462
This is outrageous, sir.

835
00:48:46,713 --> 00:48:49,910
-I didn't do any of it.
-It's all right, now.

836
00:48:50,233 --> 00:48:51,712
Curry, can I drop you anywhere?

837
00:48:52,433 --> 00:48:54,663
No, l....

838
00:49:01,233 --> 00:49:03,349
Send all his files
by tomorrow morning.

839
00:49:04,953 --> 00:49:06,671
Will you need them now?

840
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:09,189
Yes. The boy is plainly innocent.

841
00:49:11,873 --> 00:49:13,670
I accept the brief.

842
00:49:48,233 --> 00:49:50,269
Get this to the First Lord, will you?

843
00:49:50,633 --> 00:49:54,148
The chief point of criticism
against the Admiralty...

844
00:49:54,353 --> 00:49:57,948
...appears to centre
in the purely legal question...

845
00:49:58,153 --> 00:50:01,145
...of the Petition of Right
brought by a member.

846
00:50:01,353 --> 00:50:04,470
A citizen seeking redress
of the Petition of Right...

847
00:50:04,673 --> 00:50:07,233
-...and the demurrer thereto.
-Nonsense!

848
00:50:07,433 --> 00:50:10,152
This member has made
great play of this boy...

849
00:50:10,353 --> 00:50:13,072
...with his eloquence and address.

850
00:50:18,753 --> 00:50:22,792
And I was moved, as any
honourable member opposite...

851
00:50:23,153 --> 00:50:26,543
...by his resonant use of the words,
" Let right be done."

852
00:50:27,473 --> 00:50:31,022
The time-honoured phrase with which,
in his opinion...

853
00:50:31,273 --> 00:50:34,185
...the attorney general
should have supported...

854
00:50:34,433 --> 00:50:36,628
...Mr. Winslow's Petition of Right.

855
00:50:40,553 --> 00:50:43,192
All right. Let's break it down
into its essentials.

856
00:50:43,433 --> 00:50:45,901
Do we have enough votes
to put the question?

857
00:50:46,113 --> 00:50:47,466
How important is it, Bobby?

858
00:50:47,713 --> 00:50:50,671
How important is it?
It's only important to win.

859
00:50:50,873 --> 00:50:52,704
Shouldn't you be in the House?

860
00:50:52,953 --> 00:50:55,467
Looks like he's repeating
himself forever.

861
00:50:55,873 --> 00:50:57,465
Give me a piece of paper.

862
00:50:58,033 --> 00:50:59,864
Am I missing something here?

863
00:51:00,153 --> 00:51:04,669
-The thing is, the votes.
-Well, yes, well.

864
00:51:04,873 --> 00:51:06,352
Do you say we have the votes?

865
00:51:06,553 --> 00:51:10,102
Say? Do we have votes?
Do we have the money?

866
00:51:10,313 --> 00:51:14,306
The answer's perhaps. Do you
really want to spend it on this?

867
00:51:15,273 --> 00:51:17,468
Let me just have a quick look, miss.

868
00:51:18,393 --> 00:51:19,269
Can you get a vote?

869
00:51:19,513 --> 00:51:21,504
-Can you, Tony?
-Perhaps I can.

870
00:51:21,713 --> 00:51:23,544
End of the day,
it's a 1 2-year-old boy.

871
00:51:44,113 --> 00:51:46,343
-You sure you want to fight it?
-Of course.

872
00:51:46,553 --> 00:51:48,509
Before we start
calling in markers.

873
00:51:48,753 --> 00:51:50,744
Dick's saying to choose your ground.

874
00:51:50,953 --> 00:51:53,911
There's no retreat. Pick this up,
you'll have to carry it.

875
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:55,984
It's your best interest, Bobby.

876
00:51:56,233 --> 00:51:57,871
I understand.

877
00:52:19,433 --> 00:52:21,264
Excuse me.

878
00:52:25,633 --> 00:52:28,511
-What did I miss?
-You didn't miss anything.

879
00:52:30,153 --> 00:52:31,506
What's going on?

880
00:52:31,753 --> 00:52:33,664
He says all the great crimes...

881
00:52:33,873 --> 00:52:37,070
...are committed in the name
of public tranquillity.

882
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:11,711
Close the book now.

883
00:53:19,433 --> 00:53:21,105
Is everything all right?

884
00:53:21,353 --> 00:53:23,071
Everything's fine.

885
00:53:24,033 --> 00:53:25,671
Go to sleep now.

886
00:53:26,073 --> 00:53:28,667
-Good night, Mother.
-Good night.

887
00:53:33,993 --> 00:53:36,382
Good night, Ronnie.
Sleep well.

888
00:53:36,633 --> 00:53:38,066
Good night.

889
00:53:40,953 --> 00:53:43,751
I fancy this a good opportunity
of talking to Violet.

890
00:53:43,953 --> 00:53:45,466
I'll do it.
Tomorrow, perhaps--

891
00:53:45,713 --> 00:53:49,103
You'd do better to grasp the nettle.
Delay adds to your worries.

892
00:53:49,313 --> 00:53:51,065
What do you know about my worries?

893
00:53:51,273 --> 00:53:55,664
A good deal. But they'd lessen
if you faced the situation squarely.

894
00:53:56,753 --> 00:53:58,869
It won't be easy
finding another place.

895
00:53:59,113 --> 00:54:02,708
The facts are that we have half
the income we had a year ago...

896
00:54:02,953 --> 00:54:05,513
...and we're living at nearly
the same rate.

897
00:54:05,713 --> 00:54:08,511
Whichever way you look at it,
it's bad economics.

898
00:54:08,713 --> 00:54:11,830
I'm not talking about economics.
I'm talking about our life.

899
00:54:12,553 --> 00:54:15,306
Things we took for granted
don't seem to matter now.

900
00:54:15,553 --> 00:54:16,542
Such as?

901
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:21,668
Such as a happy home and anonymity and
an ordinary, respectable life.

902
00:54:22,073 --> 00:54:25,748
There's your return for it.
I pray you know what you're doing.

903
00:54:25,953 --> 00:54:28,421
-I know exactly what I am doing.
-Do you?

904
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:33,108
He's perfectly happy. He's at a good
school. He's doing very well.

905
00:54:33,313 --> 00:54:37,465
No one would know about Osbourne
if you hadn't shouted it to the world.

906
00:54:38,393 --> 00:54:41,430
Now he'll be known as "the boy
who stole that postal order."

907
00:54:41,633 --> 00:54:43,146
He didn't steal it, Grace.

908
00:54:44,233 --> 00:54:46,622
You talk about sacrificing
everything for him.

909
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:49,222
When he's grown up,
he won't thank you for it.

910
00:54:49,433 --> 00:54:53,711
Even though you've given your life to
" publish his innocence," as you say.

911
00:54:55,273 --> 00:54:57,548
Yes, Arthur, your life.

912
00:54:57,793 --> 00:55:00,865
You talk gaily about arthritis
and a touch of gout.

913
00:55:01,313 --> 00:55:04,066
You know better than
the doctors what ails you.

914
00:55:04,273 --> 00:55:07,743
You're destroying yourself
and me and your family besides.

915
00:55:07,953 --> 00:55:10,262
For what, I'd like to know?
For what?

916
00:55:11,353 --> 00:55:12,945
For justice, Grace.

917
00:55:13,353 --> 00:55:15,389
Are you sure that's true?

918
00:55:15,633 --> 00:55:18,705
Are you sure it isn't pride
and self-importance?

919
00:55:21,313 --> 00:55:24,669
No, I don't think so.
I really don't think so.

920
00:55:24,913 --> 00:55:28,747
I'm not going to cry, say I'm
sorry and make things up again.

921
00:55:28,953 --> 00:55:30,466
I can stand it all for a reason.

922
00:55:30,713 --> 00:55:34,467
But for no reason at all,
it's unfair to ask so much of me.

923
00:55:34,713 --> 00:55:36,465
It's unfair!

924
00:55:37,953 --> 00:55:39,671
What's the matter, Father?

925
00:55:40,553 --> 00:55:42,862
Mother's a little upset,
that's all.

926
00:55:43,753 --> 00:55:46,062
Why? Aren't things going very well?

927
00:55:46,273 --> 00:55:49,151
Everything's going very well.
You go on back to bed.

928
00:55:49,353 --> 00:55:50,866
Good night.

929
00:55:56,313 --> 00:55:58,224
Thank you very much.
Here you are.

930
00:56:02,073 --> 00:56:03,267
Off you go.

931
00:56:24,153 --> 00:56:25,666
Thank you, Violet.

932
00:56:28,513 --> 00:56:32,631
-How long have you been with us?
-Twenty-four years come April, sir.

933
00:56:32,833 --> 00:56:34,346
Is it as long as that?

934
00:56:34,553 --> 00:56:38,865
Cate was that high when I come in.
Dickie hadn't even been thought of.

935
00:56:39,953 --> 00:56:42,342
What do you think of this case, Violet?

936
00:56:42,553 --> 00:56:44,544
Fine old rumpus, sir, and no mistake.

937
00:56:44,753 --> 00:56:46,550
It is indeed, a fine old rumpus.

938
00:56:46,753 --> 00:56:49,313
It was in the Evening News.
Did you read it?

939
00:56:49,553 --> 00:56:51,032
What did it say?

940
00:56:51,233 --> 00:56:54,987
How it was a fuss about nothing.
Waste of the government's time.

941
00:56:55,233 --> 00:56:58,464
How it was good because
it could only happen in England.

942
00:56:58,953 --> 00:57:02,343
Seems a strange lack
of logic in that argument.

943
00:57:02,873 --> 00:57:06,070
Perhaps it was a bit different.
Still, that's what it said.

944
00:57:06,273 --> 00:57:09,868
When you think it's all because of
our Ronnie, I have to laugh.

945
00:57:10,073 --> 00:57:11,267
Really, I do.

946
00:57:11,513 --> 00:57:14,903
Wasting the government's time
at his age. I never did.

947
00:57:15,153 --> 00:57:16,791
Wonders will never cease.

948
00:57:17,873 --> 00:57:20,671
No, wonders will never cease.

949
00:57:23,913 --> 00:57:25,107
Will that be all?

950
00:57:27,873 --> 00:57:29,431
Yes, that'll be all.

951
00:57:44,673 --> 00:57:46,664
Good evening, Violet.

952
00:57:47,073 --> 00:57:48,665
Hello, Father!

953
00:57:49,553 --> 00:57:50,429
How are you?

954
00:57:50,673 --> 00:57:51,901
Slinking down alleyways.

955
00:57:52,153 --> 00:57:54,383
Are they still camping out
in the street?

956
00:57:54,633 --> 00:57:56,032
Oh, yes.

957
00:57:56,753 --> 00:57:58,186
How'd you get on this evening?

958
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,230
-Are those for me?
-Yes.

959
00:58:01,113 --> 00:58:03,707
-Is the debate over?
-As good as.

960
00:58:04,033 --> 00:58:06,263
The First Lord assured
that in the future...

961
00:58:06,473 --> 00:58:10,432
...there would be no inquiry at Osbourne
without informing the parents.

962
00:58:10,633 --> 00:58:12,146
That satisfied most members.

963
00:58:12,353 --> 00:58:15,072
What about our case?
Will he allow us a fair trial?

964
00:58:15,273 --> 00:58:17,070
Apparently not.

965
00:58:17,353 --> 00:58:19,264
I thought he'd be forced to.

966
00:58:19,473 --> 00:58:23,148
I thought so too. The House
evidently thought otherwise.

967
00:58:23,513 --> 00:58:25,663
So we're back to where we started.

968
00:58:27,033 --> 00:58:30,230
-I'm sorry, Father?
-I said, we're back where we started.

969
00:58:30,553 --> 00:58:31,872
Is that it, you mean?

970
00:58:32,193 --> 00:58:33,911
Yes, it looks like it.

971
00:58:34,913 --> 00:58:38,064
But didn't Sir Robert protest
when the First Lord refused a trial?

972
00:58:38,313 --> 00:58:40,349
Something far more spectacular.

973
00:58:40,553 --> 00:58:43,067
He had his feet on the table
and his hat over his eyes...

974
00:58:43,313 --> 00:58:45,190
...during most
of the First Lord's speech.

975
00:58:45,393 --> 00:58:47,861
He suddenly got up,
glared at the First Lord...

976
00:58:48,113 --> 00:58:50,866
...threw notes on the floor
and stalked out of the House.

977
00:58:51,073 --> 00:58:53,871
-Magnificent effect.
-Or perhaps a display of feeling?

978
00:58:54,393 --> 00:58:56,224
Sir Robert is not a man of feeling.

979
00:58:56,433 --> 00:58:59,470
I doubt any emotion at all
can stir in that dead heart.

980
00:58:59,673 --> 00:59:00,788
He took the brief.

981
00:59:01,393 --> 00:59:03,827
What have we done for him?
First-rate publicity.

982
00:59:04,033 --> 00:59:07,548
"The staunch defender of
the little man." Lucky for him.

983
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:10,347
-And lucky for us too.
-Don't fool yourself.

984
00:59:10,553 --> 00:59:13,784
He is an avaricious, a conniving,
an unfeeling man.

985
00:59:14,113 --> 00:59:16,786
We've bought his services,
for the moment.

986
00:59:16,993 --> 00:59:20,110
We've bought him like
a cheap threepenny whore--

987
00:59:20,433 --> 00:59:22,742
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

988
00:59:24,113 --> 00:59:26,388
Something gone down the wrong way?

989
00:59:26,673 --> 00:59:29,028
-May I assist?
-Most kind.

990
00:59:36,033 --> 00:59:37,432
Good evening, sir.

991
00:59:37,713 --> 00:59:40,022
I thought I'd give
an account of the day...

992
00:59:40,233 --> 00:59:42,064
...but perhaps she has
forestalled me.

993
00:59:42,313 --> 00:59:43,666
Forgive me for a moment.

994
00:59:43,873 --> 00:59:46,785
I wonder if you'd entertain
Sir Robert in my absence?

995
00:59:47,593 --> 00:59:49,663
Did you know I was in the gallery?

996
00:59:50,193 --> 00:59:52,912
How could I have missed you
with such a charming brown hat?

997
00:59:53,113 --> 00:59:56,071
Thank you. Will you betray
a technical secret?

998
00:59:56,393 --> 01:00:00,545
What happened in the first examination
to make you so sure of his innocence?

999
01:00:01,753 --> 01:00:03,232
Three things.

1000
01:00:03,673 --> 01:00:06,665
First of all, he made
far too many damaging admissions.

1001
01:00:06,913 --> 01:00:10,269
A guilty person would've been
more careful and on his guard.

1002
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:14,546
Secondly, I laid him a trap,
and thirdly, left him a loophole.

1003
01:00:14,873 --> 01:00:18,263
A guilty one would've fallen
into one and darted through the other.

1004
01:00:18,913 --> 01:00:20,187
He did neither.

1005
01:00:20,393 --> 01:00:24,466
The trap was to ask what time Elliot
put the postal order in his locker.

1006
01:00:25,153 --> 01:00:25,949
Yes.

1007
01:00:26,513 --> 01:00:27,707
And the loophole?

1008
01:00:28,713 --> 01:00:32,786
I then suggested to him that he'd
stolen the postal order for a joke...

1009
01:00:34,473 --> 01:00:36,668
...which, had he been guilty...

1010
01:00:36,873 --> 01:00:40,422
...l'm sure he would've admitted to
as being the lesser of two evils.

1011
01:00:40,753 --> 01:00:43,631
It was very cleverly thought out.

1012
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:46,262
-Thank you.
-And what of the 25 minutes?

1013
01:00:46,513 --> 01:00:47,628
25 minutes?

1014
01:00:47,873 --> 01:00:50,592
Ronnie went back to the locker room,
and there were 25 minutes...

1015
01:00:50,793 --> 01:00:52,988
...he could not account for.
What was he doing?

1016
01:00:54,833 --> 01:00:56,585
But I thought you should know.

1017
01:00:56,993 --> 01:00:57,823
Why me?

1018
01:00:58,033 --> 01:01:00,308
-It's a crime you indulge in.
-What can you mean?

1019
01:01:01,353 --> 01:01:03,344
He was smoking a cigarette.

1020
01:01:03,913 --> 01:01:06,871
May we offer you some refreshment?
Whiskey and soda?

1021
01:01:07,073 --> 01:01:07,949
A whiskey.

1022
01:01:08,673 --> 01:01:11,870
My daughter told me of
your demonstration during the speech.

1023
01:01:12,073 --> 01:01:13,791
She described it as magnificent.

1024
01:01:13,993 --> 01:01:16,063
That was good of her.
It's an old trick.

1025
01:01:16,313 --> 01:01:19,669
I've done it many times. It's nearly
always surprisingly effective.

1026
01:01:19,913 --> 01:01:22,825
Was the First Lord at all put out
by it? Did you notice?

1027
01:01:23,033 --> 01:01:25,069
How could he not be?
I wish you'd seen it.

1028
01:01:25,273 --> 01:01:27,343
I forgot to give you
this letter.

1029
01:01:27,553 --> 01:01:29,066
Thank you, Violet.

1030
01:01:29,393 --> 01:01:30,621
When did this come?

1031
01:01:30,873 --> 01:01:33,228
-A few minutes ago, miss.
-Thank you.

1032
01:01:39,393 --> 01:01:40,348
You know the writing?

1033
01:01:40,833 --> 01:01:42,664
I shouldn't read it if I were you.

1034
01:01:47,633 --> 01:01:49,624
Would you forgive me, Sir Robert?

1035
01:01:49,993 --> 01:01:50,982
Of course.

1036
01:01:51,353 --> 01:01:54,186
What do you think the next step
should be?

1037
01:01:54,513 --> 01:01:57,391
-In the abstract or the particular?
-The particular.

1038
01:01:57,593 --> 01:01:59,868
The best plan would be
to renew our efforts...

1039
01:02:00,113 --> 01:02:02,547
...to force the Director
of Public Prosecutions to act.

1040
01:02:02,753 --> 01:02:05,790
-Wouldn't that be rather unorthodox?
-I certainly hope so.

1041
01:02:05,993 --> 01:02:07,665
Do we have a chance of success?

1042
01:02:07,873 --> 01:02:10,467
Of course, or I would not suggest it.

1043
01:02:10,873 --> 01:02:13,148
Father, Sir Robert thinks
we might get...

1044
01:02:13,393 --> 01:02:16,271
...the Director
of Public Prosecutions to act.

1045
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:17,948
What?

1046
01:02:18,833 --> 01:02:20,232
What'd you say?

1047
01:02:21,433 --> 01:02:24,231
We were discussing how to proceed
with the case.

1048
01:02:28,073 --> 01:02:30,951
I'm afraid I don't think,
all things considered...

1049
01:02:31,153 --> 01:02:33,747
...that much purpose would be served
by going on.

1050
01:02:35,513 --> 01:02:38,630
I don't think any purpose would be
served by going on.

1051
01:02:39,433 --> 01:02:40,707
That's absurd.

1052
01:02:41,193 --> 01:02:44,424
Of course we must go on.
How could you say otherwise?

1053
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:49,748
I've made sacrifices for this case.
Some of them I had no right to make...

1054
01:02:50,713 --> 01:02:52,465
...but I made them nonetheless.

1055
01:02:52,673 --> 01:02:54,231
But there is a limit.

1056
01:02:54,833 --> 01:02:56,505
And I've reached it.

1057
01:03:00,633 --> 01:03:02,624
I'm sorry, Sir Robert.

1058
01:03:03,033 --> 01:03:05,422
The Winslow case is now closed.

1059
01:03:15,353 --> 01:03:17,469
-I should explain this letter.
-There is no need.

1060
01:03:17,673 --> 01:03:21,791
This is from Colonel Watherstone,
the father of the man I'm engaged to.

1061
01:03:21,993 --> 01:03:25,588
He writes that our efforts
to discredit the Admiralty...

1062
01:03:25,793 --> 01:03:29,832
...have resulted in our making
the name of Winslow a laughingstock.

1063
01:03:30,073 --> 01:03:33,429
-I don't care for his English.
-It's not very good, is it?

1064
01:03:34,033 --> 01:03:37,662
He says that unless my father
will give him a firm undertaking...

1065
01:03:37,873 --> 01:03:40,433
...to drop this whining
and reckless agitation--

1066
01:03:40,633 --> 01:03:42,271
I suppose he means the case.

1067
01:03:42,473 --> 01:03:44,748
--he will exert every influence
he has over his son...

1068
01:03:44,993 --> 01:03:46,665
...to prevent him marrying me.

1069
01:03:46,913 --> 01:03:48,028
I see.

1070
01:03:51,153 --> 01:03:53,667
-May I take a cigarette?
-Yes, of course.

1071
01:03:53,873 --> 01:03:55,943
It's a vile habit, isn't it?

1072
01:03:56,313 --> 01:03:58,224
Which of us is perfect?

1073
01:04:02,513 --> 01:04:06,108
That really was a most charming hat,
Miss Winslow.

1074
01:04:06,313 --> 01:04:07,632
I'm glad you liked it.

1075
01:04:07,873 --> 01:04:12,151
It seems decidedly wrong to me that
a lady of your political persuasion...

1076
01:04:12,353 --> 01:04:17,268
...should be allowed to adorn herself
with such a very feminine allurement.

1077
01:04:18,513 --> 01:04:21,425
It looks like trying to have
the best of both worlds.

1078
01:04:21,713 --> 01:04:22,907
Does it indeed?

1079
01:04:26,273 --> 01:04:27,626
It does.

1080
01:04:28,793 --> 01:04:31,626
And is that a particularly
female trait?

1081
01:04:32,193 --> 01:04:33,467
I'm not a militant.

1082
01:04:33,713 --> 01:04:37,308
I don't go about shattering glass
or pouring acid down pillar boxes.

1083
01:04:37,513 --> 01:04:39,071
I'm very glad to hear it.

1084
01:04:39,273 --> 01:04:42,265
Both those activities would be
unsuitable in that hat.

1085
01:04:45,433 --> 01:04:47,628
I have never yet fully grasped...

1086
01:04:47,873 --> 01:04:51,104
...what active steps you take
to propagate your cause.

1087
01:04:51,313 --> 01:04:55,750
I'm an organizing secretary
at the Woman's Suffrage Association.

1088
01:04:57,993 --> 01:04:59,426
Indeed!

1089
01:05:00,553 --> 01:05:02,066
Is the work hard?

1090
01:05:02,393 --> 01:05:03,587
Very.

1091
01:05:03,913 --> 01:05:06,143
But not, I should imagine, lucrative.

1092
01:05:06,353 --> 01:05:08,662
The work is voluntary and unpaid.

1093
01:05:08,913 --> 01:05:10,232
Dear me.

1094
01:05:10,593 --> 01:05:14,108
What sacrifices you ladies seem
prepared to make for your convictions.

1095
01:05:16,393 --> 01:05:19,146
Forgive me, sir, if I spoke
out of turn just now.

1096
01:05:22,313 --> 01:05:24,224
That's quite all right.

1097
01:05:24,673 --> 01:05:27,631
Of course, you must act
as you think fit.

1098
01:05:28,033 --> 01:05:31,992
But I suggest you delay your decision
until you've thought a while.

1099
01:05:34,273 --> 01:05:35,911
I'll answer you presently.

1100
01:06:16,513 --> 01:06:17,832
Well...

1101
01:06:18,473 --> 01:06:20,668
...my father wrote
your father a letter.

1102
01:06:20,873 --> 01:06:22,670
-You read it?
-Yes, did you?

1103
01:06:22,913 --> 01:06:24,665
He showed it to me. Yes.

1104
01:06:24,873 --> 01:06:27,068
-What's his answer?
-My father?

1105
01:06:27,273 --> 01:06:29,229
-He won't send one.
-He'll ignore it?

1106
01:06:29,433 --> 01:06:32,231
Isn't that the best response
to blackmail?

1107
01:06:33,593 --> 01:06:36,790
-It was highhanded of the old man.
-Highhanded?

1108
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:40,030
-The trouble is he's serious.
-I never thought he wasn't.

1109
01:06:40,793 --> 01:06:43,023
He's as serious as can be.

1110
01:06:43,233 --> 01:06:45,986
If your father carries on,
he'll do everything he threatened.

1111
01:06:46,193 --> 01:06:47,592
He'll forbid the match?

1112
01:06:47,913 --> 01:06:50,063
-That's right.
-An empty threat, isn't it?

1113
01:06:50,313 --> 01:06:51,712
There's always the allowance.

1114
01:06:52,073 --> 01:06:54,064
Yes. There's always the allowance.

1115
01:06:54,313 --> 01:06:57,783
Without the settlement, I can't live
on my pay. And with two of us--

1116
01:06:57,993 --> 01:07:00,951
-Two can live as cheaply as one.
-Don't you believe it.

1117
01:07:01,753 --> 01:07:03,266
Yes, I see.

1118
01:07:08,473 --> 01:07:10,384
You're off to
the House of Commons again?

1119
01:07:10,593 --> 01:07:13,232
Yes, it's hard on you, John, isn't it?

1120
01:07:17,353 --> 01:07:19,628
A fellow thought I'd like to see this.

1121
01:07:20,473 --> 01:07:22,225
He cut it out to show me.

1122
01:07:25,233 --> 01:07:26,825
Here's poor old John Bull.

1123
01:07:27,033 --> 01:07:30,582
He can't get his work done
because of the Winslow situation.

1124
01:07:30,793 --> 01:07:32,624
What do you think about that?

1125
01:07:35,553 --> 01:07:37,191
Do you want to marry me?

1126
01:07:37,713 --> 01:07:38,589
Yes, I do.

1127
01:07:38,793 --> 01:07:39,942
But isn't it too late?

1128
01:07:40,193 --> 01:07:43,583
If we drop the case, would you
still want to marry the "Winslow girl"?

1129
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:46,671
-That'll blow over.
-And we'd still have the allowance.

1130
01:07:47,233 --> 01:07:50,031
It is important. You can't shame me
into saying it isn't.

1131
01:07:50,273 --> 01:07:52,503
-I didn't mean to shame you.
-But you did.

1132
01:07:53,433 --> 01:07:54,866
I'm sorry.

1133
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:56,432
The case is lost.

1134
01:07:56,673 --> 01:07:59,312
The case is lost. Give it up.
What's your answer?

1135
01:08:00,913 --> 01:08:03,905
I love you. The answer is
I want to be your wife.

1136
01:08:05,113 --> 01:08:06,626
Then you'll drop the case?

1137
01:08:09,273 --> 01:08:10,786
Yes, I will.

1138
01:08:13,113 --> 01:08:14,307
I must tell Sir Robert.

1139
01:08:20,193 --> 01:08:20,593
--the right honourable and learned
gentleman opposite...

1140
01:08:20,593 --> 01:08:23,391
--the right honourable and learned
gentleman opposite...

1141
01:08:23,593 --> 01:08:25,709
...to calumniate the Admiralty...

1142
01:08:26,073 --> 01:08:28,951
...for a child, gentlemen.
For a child.

1143
01:08:29,193 --> 01:08:30,546
A guilty child.

1144
01:08:31,433 --> 01:08:35,585
Oh, can we not, I do beseech you,
make an end?

1145
01:08:36,593 --> 01:08:39,426
One cannot sue the Crown.

1146
01:08:39,833 --> 01:08:43,667
Justice has been done,
to the tenth decimal point.

1147
01:08:43,873 --> 01:08:47,024
And it is time to lay aside
nursery gossip...

1148
01:08:47,273 --> 01:08:50,310
...and to proceed with
the business of government.

1149
01:08:51,593 --> 01:08:53,151
You're all in, Bobby.

1150
01:08:54,233 --> 01:08:56,189
I say, you're all in. Go home.

1151
01:08:56,393 --> 01:08:57,269
We're finished.

1152
01:08:57,473 --> 01:08:58,872
You've fought the good fight.

1153
01:08:59,113 --> 01:09:02,423
You've fought the good fight, but we
ain't got the votes. It's over.

1154
01:09:02,633 --> 01:09:05,431
-We did what we could.
-Thanks for your support.

1155
01:09:06,113 --> 01:09:07,432
Don't break your heart.

1156
01:09:07,633 --> 01:09:09,464
Everybody loses one.
There's no shame.

1157
01:09:09,673 --> 01:09:12,028
-Listen to Tony.
-You can't hold back the tide.

1158
01:09:12,233 --> 01:09:15,828
You couldn't have fought harder.
The House is against you.

1159
01:09:16,033 --> 01:09:17,705
Let's let it go.

1160
01:09:17,913 --> 01:09:20,586
And I believe I can state
with certainty...

1161
01:09:20,793 --> 01:09:23,865
...that the mood of this House
is sure, correct...

1162
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:26,502
...and supportive of the Admiralty.

1163
01:09:32,913 --> 01:09:34,744
I thank you for your patience.

1164
01:09:34,953 --> 01:09:37,308
-I thank you for your time.
-What's this?

1165
01:09:37,513 --> 01:09:40,471
-Mr. Speaker, put the question.
-They're calling the question.

1166
01:09:40,713 --> 01:09:44,262
Let them call the question.
We're done. There's no shame in it.

1167
01:09:44,473 --> 01:09:45,872
The motion is....

1168
01:09:46,073 --> 01:09:48,667
Point of order, Mr. Speaker.
Point of order.

1169
01:09:48,993 --> 01:09:49,948
I am on my feet.

1170
01:09:50,153 --> 01:09:52,462
-Does this escape you?
-Point of order.

1171
01:09:52,673 --> 01:09:55,141
-I am on my feet.
-Gentlemen!

1172
01:09:55,353 --> 01:09:56,945
-There is a motion--
-Point of order.

1173
01:09:57,153 --> 01:09:58,268
I must insist!

1174
01:09:58,473 --> 01:09:59,747
Upon what grounds?

1175
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:01,592
Sit down and I'll tell you.

1176
01:10:01,793 --> 01:10:04,626
-Sit down!
-Very well, make your old speech.

1177
01:10:05,193 --> 01:10:06,342
Thank you.

1178
01:10:07,233 --> 01:10:09,349
I have a point of order, Mr. Speaker.

1179
01:10:09,553 --> 01:10:12,351
I should like to read
into the record two items.

1180
01:10:12,553 --> 01:10:15,465
First item, popular song of the day:

1181
01:10:15,713 --> 01:10:19,911
" How Still We See Thee Lie"
or "The Naughty Cadet."

1182
01:10:20,993 --> 01:10:25,032
" How dare you sully Nelson's name,
who for this land did die?

1183
01:10:25,233 --> 01:10:27,793
Oh, naughty cadet, for shame,
for shame.

1184
01:10:27,993 --> 01:10:30,461
How still we see thee lie."

1185
01:10:30,713 --> 01:10:33,750
They suggest
our concern for the boy...

1186
01:10:33,993 --> 01:10:36,746
...might perhaps tarnish
the reputation of Lord Nelson.

1187
01:10:38,593 --> 01:10:40,823
-You said two items.
-The other one is this.

1188
01:10:41,073 --> 01:10:43,223
It's from a slightly older source.
It is this:

1189
01:10:43,433 --> 01:10:46,186
"You shall not side with the great
against the powerless."

1190
01:10:46,393 --> 01:10:47,712
Point of order.

1191
01:10:47,913 --> 01:10:49,312
I'm on my feet.

1192
01:10:49,513 --> 01:10:50,309
Will you yield?

1193
01:10:50,513 --> 01:10:52,071
I will not yield!

1194
01:10:52,273 --> 01:10:55,982
"You shall not side with the great
against the powerless."

1195
01:10:56,513 --> 01:11:00,870
Have you heard those words, gentlemen?
Do you recognize their source?

1196
01:11:01,273 --> 01:11:04,822
From that same source I add
this injunction. It is this:

1197
01:11:05,073 --> 01:11:06,984
"What you do to the least of them...

1198
01:11:07,193 --> 01:11:08,626
...you do to me."

1199
01:11:11,273 --> 01:11:12,422
Now.

1200
01:11:13,113 --> 01:11:15,024
Now, gentlemen....

1201
01:11:15,873 --> 01:11:17,989
-Good afternoon, miss.
-Hello.

1202
01:11:18,673 --> 01:11:22,461
I'll be damned if that's not the--
Will you get on the camera?

1203
01:11:22,673 --> 01:11:23,583
What happened?

1204
01:11:23,833 --> 01:11:27,064
What happened? First Lord thought
he was safe, home free.

1205
01:11:27,313 --> 01:11:29,065
Sir Robert spoke.
Now he's under attack.

1206
01:11:29,273 --> 01:11:31,264
-From whom?
-From everybody.

1207
01:11:31,473 --> 01:11:33,703
When he comes out,
here's what I want.

1208
01:11:34,473 --> 01:11:36,031
Excuse me, sir.

1209
01:11:37,273 --> 01:11:38,262
What happened?

1210
01:11:38,513 --> 01:11:39,707
It seems, miss...

1211
01:11:39,913 --> 01:11:41,949
...that rather than risk a division...

1212
01:11:42,153 --> 01:11:45,190
...the First Lord is endorsing
the Petition of Right.

1213
01:11:45,753 --> 01:11:49,109
It means the case of Winslow v. Rex
can therefore come to court.

1214
01:11:59,033 --> 01:12:01,593
Well, Miss Winslow,
what are my instructions?

1215
01:12:02,873 --> 01:12:05,023
Do you need my instructions?

1216
01:12:05,233 --> 01:12:07,269
Aren't they already on the petition?

1217
01:12:07,513 --> 01:12:09,981
Doesn't it say, " Let right be done"?

1218
01:12:10,193 --> 01:12:12,866
Then we must endeavour to see
that it is.

1219
01:12:47,753 --> 01:12:50,426
I've got The Beacon.
I've got the news!

1220
01:12:50,873 --> 01:12:54,343
Read the latest about the Winslow boy
right here in these pages!

1221
01:12:57,193 --> 01:12:58,262
Read it here!

1222
01:12:58,473 --> 01:13:00,668
-Here it is. Thank you.
-Thank you.

1223
01:13:00,873 --> 01:13:02,386
Latest on the Winslow boy!

1224
01:13:07,833 --> 01:13:10,666
You're thinner.
I like your new suit.

1225
01:13:10,873 --> 01:13:13,262
Off the peg at
three-and-a-half guineas.

1226
01:13:13,473 --> 01:13:15,543
Does that go on all the time outside?

1227
01:13:15,753 --> 01:13:18,028
-We're waiting for the verdict.
-Where's Cate?

1228
01:13:18,233 --> 01:13:21,031
Cate takes the morning session.
I go in the afternoon.

1229
01:13:21,633 --> 01:13:23,112
How's it all going?

1230
01:13:25,073 --> 01:13:26,142
I don't know.

1231
01:13:27,073 --> 01:13:30,429
I've been there all four days now
and hardly understood a word.

1232
01:13:33,513 --> 01:13:34,741
Will there be room for me?

1233
01:13:35,273 --> 01:13:38,185
Oh, yes. They reserve places
for the family.

1234
01:13:38,393 --> 01:13:40,623
How'd Ronnie get on
in the witness box?

1235
01:13:40,913 --> 01:13:42,426
Two days he was cross-examined.

1236
01:13:42,673 --> 01:13:45,870
Two whole days. Imagine!
Poor little pet.

1237
01:13:46,073 --> 01:13:49,463
He didn't seem to mind. He said
two days with the attorney general...

1238
01:13:49,713 --> 01:13:52,227
...wasn't as bad as two minutes
with Sir Robert.

1239
01:13:54,993 --> 01:13:57,029
Cate said he made a good impression.

1240
01:13:57,233 --> 01:13:58,188
How is Cate?

1241
01:13:59,673 --> 01:14:02,551
All right. You heard about John,
I suppose.

1242
01:14:02,793 --> 01:14:04,624
That's what I meant.
How has she taken it?

1243
01:14:04,833 --> 01:14:08,223
You can never tell. She never lets
you know what she's feeling.

1244
01:14:08,473 --> 01:14:11,033
We all think he behaved very badly.

1245
01:14:12,113 --> 01:14:14,024
Your father's on the terrace.

1246
01:14:27,913 --> 01:14:29,266
How are you, Dickie?

1247
01:14:29,513 --> 01:14:31,424
Very well, thank you, Father.

1248
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:34,511
Mr. Lamb tells me you've joined
the Territorials.

1249
01:14:34,713 --> 01:14:35,907
I'm sorry, what?

1250
01:14:37,633 --> 01:14:41,512
Mr. Lamb tells me that you've enlisted
in the Territorials.

1251
01:14:42,393 --> 01:14:43,712
Why have you done that?

1252
01:14:43,913 --> 01:14:47,792
There's a chance of a scrap soon.
If there is, I want to get in on it.

1253
01:14:48,433 --> 01:14:52,267
If there is a "scrap," you'll do
far better to stay at the bank.

1254
01:14:52,473 --> 01:14:54,225
Too much conflict at the bank.

1255
01:14:54,433 --> 01:14:58,221
-Is that how it seems to you?
-Yes, makes the blood run cold.

1256
01:14:59,513 --> 01:15:00,582
How's Catherine?

1257
01:15:01,033 --> 01:15:04,389
She's late. She was in
at half-past yesterday.

1258
01:15:04,593 --> 01:15:06,709
Perhaps they're taking
the lunch interval later.

1259
01:15:06,913 --> 01:15:09,825
Lunch interval? This isn't
a cricket match, Grace.

1260
01:15:11,233 --> 01:15:14,828
Nor, may I say,
is it a matinee at the Gaiety.

1261
01:15:15,033 --> 01:15:17,149
Why are you wearing
that unsuitable getup?

1262
01:15:17,753 --> 01:15:20,665
Don't you like it, dear?
It's Madame Dupont's best.

1263
01:15:21,153 --> 01:15:25,465
Grace, your son is facing a charge
of theft and forgery.

1264
01:15:25,673 --> 01:15:29,461
It's so difficult. I can't wear
the same old dress day after day.

1265
01:15:29,713 --> 01:15:31,829
It's repetitious and depressing.

1266
01:15:32,033 --> 01:15:33,102
I'll tell you what.

1267
01:15:33,633 --> 01:15:37,228
I'll wear my black coat and skirt
tomorrow for the verdict.

1268
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:40,989
Yes, that's what I'll do.
I'll wear it for the verdict.

1269
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:44,586
-Did you say my lunch was ready?
-Yes, dear.

1270
01:15:44,793 --> 01:15:48,786
It's only cold. I made the salad
myself. Violet is at the trial.

1271
01:15:49,113 --> 01:15:52,150
Violet? She was under sentence
the last time I saw you.

1272
01:15:52,353 --> 01:15:54,344
We don't have
the courage to tell her.

1273
01:15:54,553 --> 01:15:57,465
-I have the courage.
-Funny that you don't, then.

1274
01:15:57,673 --> 01:16:01,461
See how these taunts of cowardice are
daily flung at my head?

1275
01:16:01,673 --> 01:16:04,028
Should I take them up?
I'm forbidden to move.

1276
01:16:04,233 --> 01:16:06,144
Such is the logic of women.

1277
01:16:07,513 --> 01:16:10,027
Will you take him away
after the verdict?

1278
01:16:13,713 --> 01:16:15,863
-He promised to go to a nursing home.
-Will he?

1279
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:19,423
-How should I know?
-If he loses now, he's lost for good.

1280
01:16:20,393 --> 01:16:22,224
I can only hope that it's true.

1281
01:16:22,433 --> 01:16:24,230
Lord, the heat!

1282
01:16:25,153 --> 01:16:28,782
Mother, can't you get rid of
those reporters? Hello, Dickie.

1283
01:16:28,993 --> 01:16:31,143
-Hello.
-Come to be in at the death?

1284
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:33,628
-Is that what it'll be?
-Looks like it.

1285
01:16:33,873 --> 01:16:36,467
-You're late, Catherine.
-I know. I'm sorry.

1286
01:16:36,673 --> 01:16:38,425
There was such a huge crowd.

1287
01:16:38,913 --> 01:16:40,824
I have to go and change.

1288
01:16:41,753 --> 01:16:43,232
A bigger crowd than yesterday?

1289
01:16:43,473 --> 01:16:45,429
Yes, Mother, far bigger.

1290
01:16:45,913 --> 01:16:47,471
So how did it go this morning?

1291
01:16:47,713 --> 01:16:50,591
Sir Robert finished his
cross-examination of the postmistress.

1292
01:16:50,793 --> 01:16:52,829
I thought he'd demolished her
completely.

1293
01:16:53,073 --> 01:16:56,031
She couldn't identify
Ronnie in the commander's office.

1294
01:16:56,233 --> 01:16:58,667
She couldn't be sure
of the time he came in.

1295
01:16:58,953 --> 01:17:03,231
She admitted being called to the phone
while he bought his postal order...

1296
01:17:03,433 --> 01:17:06,664
...and that all cadets looked
alike to her in their uniforms...

1297
01:17:06,873 --> 01:17:11,151
...so it might have been another
cadet who cashed the 5 shillings.

1298
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:15,432
A brilliant cross-examination.
He didn't frighten her or bully her.

1299
01:17:15,633 --> 01:17:18,352
He simply coaxed her into tying
herself into knots.

1300
01:17:18,553 --> 01:17:22,546
Then the attorney general asked her
again whether she was positive...

1301
01:17:22,793 --> 01:17:25,671
...that the same boy that bought
the 1 5-and-6 postal order...

1302
01:17:25,913 --> 01:17:27,710
...also cashed the five-shilling one.

1303
01:17:27,913 --> 01:17:31,826
She said she was quite sure because
Ronnie was such a good-looking boy...

1304
01:17:32,073 --> 01:17:33,745
...that she'd specially noticed him.

1305
01:17:34,393 --> 01:17:36,668
She hadn't said that
in her examination-in-chief.

1306
01:17:36,913 --> 01:17:39,029
Ronnie, good-looking?
What utter rot.

1307
01:17:39,273 --> 01:17:42,822
If he was so good-looking why couldn't
she identify him the same evening?

1308
01:17:43,073 --> 01:17:46,588
Ask the attorney general. I'm sure he
has a beautifully reasonable answer.

1309
01:17:47,033 --> 01:17:48,864
Who else gave evidence
for the other side?

1310
01:17:49,113 --> 01:17:49,909
The commander...

1311
01:17:50,113 --> 01:17:52,502
...the chief petty officer
and a boy at the college.

1312
01:17:52,713 --> 01:17:55,432
-Anything damaging?
-Nothing that we didn't expect.

1313
01:17:56,033 --> 01:17:57,785
Did you see anyone interesting
in court?

1314
01:17:58,113 --> 01:18:00,832
Yes, Mother. John Watherstone.

1315
01:18:01,113 --> 01:18:03,149
John? You didn't speak to him,
I hope.

1316
01:18:03,353 --> 01:18:05,423
-Yes, of course I did.
-You didn't!

1317
01:18:05,673 --> 01:18:08,267
-What did he say?
-He wished us luck.

1318
01:18:08,513 --> 01:18:09,628
What impertinence.

1319
01:18:09,873 --> 01:18:11,829
Is that what it is?

1320
01:18:12,273 --> 01:18:14,662
I wonder if Violet will remember
to get onions.

1321
01:18:14,913 --> 01:18:17,143
I better get them myself
on the way back.

1322
01:18:17,353 --> 01:18:19,105
Yes, get them on the way back.

1323
01:18:20,793 --> 01:18:22,192
I'm so sorry, dear.

1324
01:18:22,673 --> 01:18:23,662
What for, Mother?

1325
01:18:23,913 --> 01:18:26,711
John. Being such a bad hat.

1326
01:18:27,713 --> 01:18:29,465
I never did like him very much.

1327
01:18:29,673 --> 01:18:31,152
No, I know.

1328
01:18:47,073 --> 01:18:49,826
You're looking well.
A trifle thinner, perhaps.

1329
01:18:50,073 --> 01:18:51,222
Hard work, Father.

1330
01:18:51,433 --> 01:18:53,742
-Or late hours?
-You can't keep late hours in Reading.

1331
01:18:53,953 --> 01:18:56,421
You could keep late hours anywhere.

1332
01:18:56,873 --> 01:19:00,229
I had quite a good report about you
from Mr. Lamb at the bank.

1333
01:19:00,473 --> 01:19:01,588
Good old Mr. Lamb.

1334
01:19:01,793 --> 01:19:04,023
I took him racing last Saturday.

1335
01:19:04,913 --> 01:19:07,347
Had the time of his life
and lost his shirt.

1336
01:19:08,793 --> 01:19:10,988
Did he? Did he, indeed?

1337
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:15,671
Now, Dickie, when we get
to the front door...

1338
01:19:15,913 --> 01:19:18,632
...put your head down
and charge through them all.

1339
01:19:18,873 --> 01:19:20,784
Why don't you go through
the garden?

1340
01:19:20,993 --> 01:19:23,985
I can't risk this hat
going through the roses.

1341
01:19:24,193 --> 01:19:27,026
I always say, " I'm the maid
and I don't know nothing."

1342
01:19:27,273 --> 01:19:29,025
So don't be surprised.

1343
01:19:29,593 --> 01:19:31,185
Right-o, Mother.

1344
01:19:53,993 --> 01:19:56,143
Are we going to lose this case?

1345
01:20:01,353 --> 01:20:02,866
How's Sir Robert?

1346
01:20:03,073 --> 01:20:05,462
The papers said he told the judge
he felt ill...

1347
01:20:05,673 --> 01:20:08,506
...and might ask for an adjournment.
I trust he won't collapse.

1348
01:20:08,713 --> 01:20:13,184
He won't. It was another of those
brilliant tricks he boasts about.

1349
01:20:13,393 --> 01:20:16,032
It got him the sympathy of the court
and possibly....

1350
01:20:16,593 --> 01:20:18,470
No, I won't say that.

1351
01:20:19,113 --> 01:20:20,341
Say it.

1352
01:20:21,353 --> 01:20:24,629
Possibly provided him with an excuse
if he's beaten.

1353
01:20:26,113 --> 01:20:27,466
I see.

1354
01:20:33,113 --> 01:20:34,546
Come in, Desmond.

1355
01:20:37,153 --> 01:20:40,828
I trust you do not object to me
employing this furtive entry...

1356
01:20:41,033 --> 01:20:43,024
...but the crowds in front
are most alarming.

1357
01:20:43,313 --> 01:20:45,190
-Most alarming.
-Why have you left court?

1358
01:20:45,393 --> 01:20:48,703
My partner will be holding the fort.
He's perfectly competent.

1359
01:20:48,913 --> 01:20:50,426
I'm glad to hear it.

1360
01:20:51,793 --> 01:20:54,387
I wondered if I might see
Catherine alone.

1361
01:20:54,593 --> 01:20:58,142
I have a matter of some urgency
to communicate to her.

1362
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:01,390
Do you wish to hear
this urgent matter, Cate?

1363
01:21:01,593 --> 01:21:02,946
Yes, Father.

1364
01:21:13,473 --> 01:21:15,429
I have to be back in court.

1365
01:21:16,433 --> 01:21:18,993
Perhaps you would give me
a moment of your time.

1366
01:21:19,193 --> 01:21:20,706
Yes, of course, Desmond.

1367
01:21:28,513 --> 01:21:32,472
It occurred to me during the lunch
recess that I had better see you today.

1368
01:21:32,713 --> 01:21:33,748
Yes?

1369
01:21:33,953 --> 01:21:36,069
I have a question to put
to you which...

1370
01:21:36,313 --> 01:21:39,225
...if I had postponed
until after the verdict...

1371
01:21:39,433 --> 01:21:42,743
...you might have thought had been
prompted by pity if we'd lost...

1372
01:21:42,953 --> 01:21:47,549
...or if we'd won, your reply might
have been influenced by gratitude.

1373
01:21:47,753 --> 01:21:49,948
And that, of course, wouldn't do.

1374
01:21:50,193 --> 01:21:51,626
Do you follow me, Cate?

1375
01:21:51,833 --> 01:21:54,028
Yes, Desmond. I think I do.

1376
01:21:55,393 --> 01:21:59,272
Then perhaps you have some inkling
of what the question is?

1377
01:21:59,473 --> 01:22:01,304
Yes, I think I have.

1378
01:22:04,073 --> 01:22:07,224
I ought to have followed
the usual practice in such cases...

1379
01:22:07,473 --> 01:22:09,589
...and said I had no inkling whatever.

1380
01:22:09,793 --> 01:22:13,786
Your directness and honesty are two of
the qualities I so much admire in you.

1381
01:22:13,993 --> 01:22:17,144
I'm glad that you've guessed.
It makes my task the easier.

1382
01:22:17,713 --> 01:22:21,911
The facts are these: That you don't
love me and never can...

1383
01:22:23,033 --> 01:22:26,070
...and that I love you,
always have and always will.

1384
01:22:26,313 --> 01:22:30,465
It is a situation which, after careful
consideration, I'm prepared to accept.

1385
01:22:30,713 --> 01:22:34,672
I reached this decision months ago,
but thought it better to wait...

1386
01:22:34,913 --> 01:22:38,588
...until this case, which is so much
on all our minds, should be over.

1387
01:22:38,793 --> 01:22:42,547
Then at lunch today, I determined
to anticipate the verdict tomorrow.

1388
01:22:43,713 --> 01:22:47,592
I see. Thank you so much.
That makes everything much clearer.

1389
01:22:48,273 --> 01:22:52,152
There is much more
that I meant to say...

1390
01:22:53,273 --> 01:22:54,991
...but I'll put it in a letter.

1391
01:22:55,433 --> 01:22:57,185
Yes, Desmond. Do.

1392
01:22:58,993 --> 01:23:02,668
-Give me a few days to think it over?
-Of course. Of course.

1393
01:23:02,913 --> 01:23:05,029
I need hardly tell you how grateful--

1394
01:23:05,273 --> 01:23:08,071
There is no need, Cate.
No need at all.

1395
01:23:12,113 --> 01:23:14,263
You mustn't keep your taxi waiting.

1396
01:23:19,313 --> 01:23:21,588
I may expect your answer
in a few days?

1397
01:23:21,793 --> 01:23:23,226
Yes, Desmond.

1398
01:23:23,953 --> 01:23:26,103
I must get back to court.

1399
01:23:28,593 --> 01:23:29,628
Well...

1400
01:23:31,393 --> 01:23:32,792
...what did you think today?

1401
01:23:32,993 --> 01:23:37,066
I thought she restored the case
with her point about Ronnie's looks.

1402
01:23:37,313 --> 01:23:38,268
No, not at all.

1403
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:42,028
There is still the overwhelming fact
that she couldn't identify him.

1404
01:23:43,713 --> 01:23:46,068
-A brilliant cross-examination.
-Brilliant.

1405
01:23:46,313 --> 01:23:48,144
Strange man, Sir Robert.

1406
01:23:48,473 --> 01:23:50,464
At times so cold and distant and....

1407
01:23:50,793 --> 01:23:52,192
Passionless.

1408
01:23:52,913 --> 01:23:55,666
And yet, he has a real passion
about this case.

1409
01:23:55,913 --> 01:23:57,266
-Does he?
-Yes. I know--

1410
01:23:57,473 --> 01:23:59,748
This must, on no account,
go any further--

1411
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:04,066
I know he has made a great personal
sacrifice to bring it to court.

1412
01:24:04,273 --> 01:24:06,309
Sacrifice? What, of another brief?

1413
01:24:06,513 --> 01:24:08,151
That is no sacrifice to him.

1414
01:24:08,353 --> 01:24:12,107
He was offered-- You really
promise to keep this to yourself?

1415
01:24:12,593 --> 01:24:15,949
Whatever the government offered him
can't be as startling as all that.

1416
01:24:16,193 --> 01:24:18,468
-He's in the opposition.
-Indeed.

1417
01:24:18,673 --> 01:24:21,904
Therefore, a most gracious compliment.

1418
01:24:22,153 --> 01:24:23,871
And what position was he offered?

1419
01:24:28,193 --> 01:24:29,626
Yes, that's right.

1420
01:24:30,153 --> 01:24:32,621
That's right.
And he turned it down...

1421
01:24:32,833 --> 01:24:36,189
...simply in order to carry on
with the case of Winslow v. Rex.

1422
01:24:36,393 --> 01:24:38,588
Strange are the ways of men,
are they not?

1423
01:24:39,033 --> 01:24:40,432
Goodbye, my dear.

1424
01:24:59,393 --> 01:25:02,271
-Father, I've been a fool.
-Have you, my dear?

1425
01:25:02,513 --> 01:25:04,583
An utter fool.

1426
01:25:05,473 --> 01:25:09,307
In default of further information, I
can only repeat, " Have you, my dear?"

1427
01:25:10,393 --> 01:25:14,181
There can be no further information.
I'm under a pledge of secrecy.

1428
01:25:17,713 --> 01:25:19,510
What did Desmond want?

1429
01:25:20,313 --> 01:25:21,871
To marry me.

1430
01:25:22,673 --> 01:25:26,188
I trust the folly you referred to
wasn't your acceptance of him.

1431
01:25:26,393 --> 01:25:27,951
Would it be such folly?

1432
01:25:28,673 --> 01:25:29,947
Lunacy.

1433
01:25:30,153 --> 01:25:31,188
I'm nearly 30.

1434
01:25:31,393 --> 01:25:33,748
-30 isn't the end of life.
-Is that so?

1435
01:25:33,953 --> 01:25:37,787
Better far to live and die an old maid
than to be married to Desmond.

1436
01:25:37,993 --> 01:25:40,382
Even an old maid must eat.

1437
01:25:42,913 --> 01:25:46,064
Did you take my suggestion with regard
to your Suffrage Association?

1438
01:25:46,273 --> 01:25:48,184
-Yes.
-You demanded a salary?

1439
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:49,712
I asked for one.

1440
01:25:49,913 --> 01:25:51,187
They'll give it to you?

1441
01:25:51,633 --> 01:25:53,305
Two pounds a week.

1442
01:25:54,633 --> 01:25:57,431
No, Father, the choice is
quite simple.

1443
01:25:57,913 --> 01:26:00,985
Either I marry Desmond and settle down
into a comfortable...

1444
01:26:01,193 --> 01:26:03,070
...and not really useless existence...

1445
01:26:03,273 --> 01:26:06,583
...or I go on for the rest of my life
in service of a hopeless cause.

1446
01:26:08,913 --> 01:26:10,631
A hopeless cause.

1447
01:26:11,113 --> 01:26:13,149
I've never heard you say that before.

1448
01:26:13,473 --> 01:26:15,509
I've never felt it before.

1449
01:26:31,313 --> 01:26:33,827
John's getting married next month.

1450
01:26:35,313 --> 01:26:37,224
I see. I see.

1451
01:26:37,913 --> 01:26:39,266
Did he tell you?

1452
01:26:39,513 --> 01:26:42,391
-Yes. He was very apologetic.
-Apologetic?

1453
01:26:42,593 --> 01:26:46,381
It's a girl I know slightly.
She'll make him a good wife.

1454
01:26:46,633 --> 01:26:48,225
Is he in love with her?

1455
01:26:50,713 --> 01:26:53,466
No more than he was with me.
Perhaps a little less.

1456
01:26:53,673 --> 01:26:56,062
-Why marry her so soon--?
-After jilting me?

1457
01:26:56,273 --> 01:26:58,662
He thinks there'll be a war soon,
and if there is...

1458
01:26:58,913 --> 01:27:02,030
...his regiment will be among
the first to go overseas.

1459
01:27:02,793 --> 01:27:05,785
She's a general's daughter.
Very, very suitable.

1460
01:27:08,113 --> 01:27:09,751
I'm so sorry.

1461
01:27:10,273 --> 01:27:14,266
If you could go back and choose again,
would your choice be different?

1462
01:27:16,553 --> 01:27:17,781
Perhaps.

1463
01:27:17,993 --> 01:27:19,472
I don't think so.

1464
01:27:20,993 --> 01:27:22,745
I don't think so either.

1465
01:27:23,513 --> 01:27:27,347
I still say we both knew what we
were doing and were right to do it.

1466
01:27:28,993 --> 01:27:30,711
You won't marry Desmond?

1467
01:27:30,913 --> 01:27:34,110
In the words of the prime minister,
Father, "Wait and see."

1468
01:27:38,113 --> 01:27:42,026
-What's that boy shouting?
-Only "Winslow case latest."

1469
01:27:42,433 --> 01:27:43,866
It doesn't sound like " latest."

1470
01:27:44,113 --> 01:27:47,901
Did they win or did they lose?
I've got the Winslow case result!

1471
01:27:48,673 --> 01:27:50,584
In these pages!

1472
01:27:50,793 --> 01:27:52,749
Winslow case result!

1473
01:27:53,153 --> 01:27:55,064
There must be some mistake.

1474
01:28:01,353 --> 01:28:02,866
Oh, sir.

1475
01:28:05,313 --> 01:28:06,985
Yes, Violet. What is it?

1476
01:28:13,633 --> 01:28:15,430
I don't know how to tell you.

1477
01:28:17,113 --> 01:28:19,468
Just after they come back
from lunch....

1478
01:28:19,673 --> 01:28:22,141
Mrs. Winslow weren't there,
nor Master Ronnie.

1479
01:28:22,393 --> 01:28:25,430
Shouting, the carrying on,
you never heard anything like it.

1480
01:28:25,633 --> 01:28:29,342
Sir Robert standing there at the table
with his wig on crooked...

1481
01:28:29,553 --> 01:28:31,623
...tears running down his face.

1482
01:28:32,713 --> 01:28:34,863
Running down his face, they were!

1483
01:28:35,673 --> 01:28:38,187
Cook and me, we did
a bit of crying too.

1484
01:28:38,393 --> 01:28:41,749
Everyone was cheering. Judge kept
shouting. It wasn't any good.

1485
01:28:41,953 --> 01:28:43,181
The jury joined in.

1486
01:28:43,393 --> 01:28:46,942
Some of them climbed out of the box
to shake hands with Sir Robert.

1487
01:28:47,153 --> 01:28:49,951
Outside, it was the same.
Couldn't move for the crowd.

1488
01:28:50,153 --> 01:28:52,269
Think they'd gone mad
the way they carried on.

1489
01:28:52,513 --> 01:28:54,424
Some shouting, "Good old Winslow" ...

1490
01:28:54,633 --> 01:28:56,464
...some singing, "Jolly good fellow."

1491
01:28:56,673 --> 01:28:59,426
Cook had her hat knocked off again.
She did.

1492
01:28:59,673 --> 01:29:01,629
Sure as I'm standing here
to tell you.

1493
01:29:02,713 --> 01:29:03,907
Well, sir...

1494
01:29:04,433 --> 01:29:07,743
...you must be feeling nice
and pleased. Now it's all over.

1495
01:29:09,273 --> 01:29:11,309
Yes, Violet. I am.

1496
01:29:12,753 --> 01:29:15,187
I always said it'd come out
all right in the end.

1497
01:29:18,393 --> 01:29:19,826
Yes, you did.

1498
01:29:23,993 --> 01:29:25,426
Yes, I did.

1499
01:29:30,633 --> 01:29:32,669
Well, I don't mind telling you, sir.

1500
01:29:32,913 --> 01:29:36,872
I wondered if you and Miss Cate
weren't just wasting your time.

1501
01:29:37,113 --> 01:29:40,150
Still, couldn't have felt that
if you'd been in court today.

1502
01:29:40,353 --> 01:29:44,141
Mrs. Winslow asked me to remember
most particular to pick up onions--

1503
01:29:44,393 --> 01:29:47,271
I believe Mrs. Winslow is
picking them up herself.

1504
01:29:47,473 --> 01:29:49,225
Oh, jolly good.
Oh, poor madam...

1505
01:29:49,473 --> 01:29:52,465
...when she gets
to court and finds it's all over.

1506
01:29:52,673 --> 01:29:55,312
-Well, congratulations, I'm sure.
-Thank you.

1507
01:30:02,913 --> 01:30:05,222
It would appear, then, that we've won.

1508
01:30:06,113 --> 01:30:08,832
Yes, Father, it would appear
that we've won.

1509
01:30:13,153 --> 01:30:15,064
I would've liked to have been there.

1510
01:30:17,593 --> 01:30:19,151
Sir Robert Morton.

1511
01:30:20,353 --> 01:30:21,581
Good afternoon.

1512
01:30:23,313 --> 01:30:24,951
I thought you'd like to hear...

1513
01:30:25,153 --> 01:30:28,828
...the actual terms of
the attorney general's statement...

1514
01:30:29,233 --> 01:30:31,224
...so I jotted them down for you.

1515
01:30:32,913 --> 01:30:36,144
"On behalf of the Admiralty,"
et cetera, et cetera...

1516
01:30:36,673 --> 01:30:41,349
..."the cadet, Ronald Winslow, did not
write the name on the postal order.

1517
01:30:41,713 --> 01:30:43,431
He did not take it.

1518
01:30:43,873 --> 01:30:45,625
He did not cash it.

1519
01:30:46,633 --> 01:30:49,943
That he is consequently innocent
of the charge.

1520
01:30:50,273 --> 01:30:51,831
This is a full, unreserved...

1521
01:30:52,033 --> 01:30:54,752
...and a complete acceptance
of his statements."

1522
01:30:54,953 --> 01:30:56,181
Thank you, Sir Robert.

1523
01:30:56,793 --> 01:31:00,024
It's hard for me to find the words
with which to thank you.

1524
01:31:01,353 --> 01:31:03,469
Do not trouble yourself
to search for them.

1525
01:31:03,713 --> 01:31:08,025
Let us take conventional expressions
of gratitude for granted, shall we?

1526
01:31:15,353 --> 01:31:17,423
Pity you were not in court.

1527
01:31:17,953 --> 01:31:19,909
The verdict caused quite a stir.

1528
01:31:20,113 --> 01:31:23,310
So I heard. Why did the Admiralty
resign the case?

1529
01:31:23,513 --> 01:31:25,981
It was a foregone conclusion.

1530
01:31:26,593 --> 01:31:29,426
Once the handwriting expert
had been discredited...

1531
01:31:29,673 --> 01:31:31,664
...l knew we had a sporting chance.

1532
01:31:31,913 --> 01:31:34,427
But this morning you seemed
so depressed.

1533
01:31:34,673 --> 01:31:35,822
Did l?

1534
01:31:37,793 --> 01:31:39,545
Perhaps the heat in the courtroom.

1535
01:31:43,433 --> 01:31:45,993
The gentlemen at the front say
to make a statement.

1536
01:31:46,193 --> 01:31:47,831
They won't go away unless you do.

1537
01:31:48,033 --> 01:31:50,069
Very well, Violet. Thank you.

1538
01:31:53,513 --> 01:31:55,105
What shall I say to them?

1539
01:31:55,873 --> 01:31:58,023
I hardly think it matters, sir.

1540
01:31:58,833 --> 01:32:01,791
Whatever you say has
little bearing on what they write.

1541
01:32:01,993 --> 01:32:02,869
I could say...

1542
01:32:04,153 --> 01:32:07,350
..."This victory isn't mine,
it belongs to the people."

1543
01:32:07,593 --> 01:32:10,153
How does that strike you?
A trifle pretentious?

1544
01:32:10,353 --> 01:32:14,824
Perhaps, sir. I should say it
nonetheless. It will be very popular.

1545
01:32:15,433 --> 01:32:17,389
Perhaps I should just say...

1546
01:32:17,833 --> 01:32:19,585
..."Thank God we beat 'em."

1547
01:32:24,193 --> 01:32:25,626
Miss Winslow...

1548
01:32:25,833 --> 01:32:29,109
...might I ask you for a glass
of your excellent whiskey?

1549
01:32:29,313 --> 01:32:31,065
-Yes, of course.
-Very kind.

1550
01:32:31,313 --> 01:32:36,182
I beg your pardon. How remiss of me
not to offer you any hospitality.

1551
01:32:37,393 --> 01:32:41,352
I'll correct that straightaway.
What must you think of me?

1552
01:32:41,873 --> 01:32:44,751
Perhaps you would forgive me
in not getting up?

1553
01:32:44,953 --> 01:32:47,421
The heat in that courtroom was
really infernal.

1554
01:32:47,673 --> 01:32:49,186
Are you all right?

1555
01:32:49,393 --> 01:32:51,861
Just a slight nervous reaction,
that's all.

1556
01:32:52,113 --> 01:32:55,264
Besides, I've not been feeling
myself all day.

1557
01:32:55,513 --> 01:32:58,391
I told the judge so this morning,
if you remember.

1558
01:32:59,393 --> 01:33:02,783
But I doubt if he believed me.
He thought it was a trick.

1559
01:33:03,553 --> 01:33:06,829
What suspicious minds people have,
have they not?

1560
01:33:08,153 --> 01:33:09,427
Yes.

1561
01:33:13,673 --> 01:33:14,583
Thank you.

1562
01:33:16,033 --> 01:33:20,470
I'm afraid I have a confession and
an apology to make to you, Sir Robert.

1563
01:33:21,633 --> 01:33:25,831
I'm sure one is rash and the other is
superfluous. I'd rather hear neither.

1564
01:33:26,073 --> 01:33:27,825
I'm afraid you must.

1565
01:33:29,073 --> 01:33:30,950
This is the last time
I'll see you...

1566
01:33:31,153 --> 01:33:34,304
...and it is a better penance for me
to say this than write it.

1567
01:33:34,753 --> 01:33:37,586
I have entirely misjudged
your attitude to this case...

1568
01:33:37,833 --> 01:33:41,712
...and if in doing so I have ever
seemed either rude or ungrateful...

1569
01:33:41,953 --> 01:33:44,626
...l am sincerely and humbly sorry.

1570
01:33:45,073 --> 01:33:48,270
You have never seemed to me
either rude or ungrateful.

1571
01:33:48,513 --> 01:33:51,232
My attitude to this case has been
the same as yours:

1572
01:33:51,473 --> 01:33:54,510
A determination to win at all costs.

1573
01:33:55,313 --> 01:33:56,871
When you talk of gratitude...

1574
01:33:57,113 --> 01:34:01,231
...you must remember that those costs
were not mine, but yours.

1575
01:34:04,273 --> 01:34:07,026
Weren't they also yours, Sir Robert?

1576
01:34:10,393 --> 01:34:11,462
I beg your pardon?

1577
01:34:11,673 --> 01:34:14,790
Haven't you too made
a certain sacrifice for the case?

1578
01:34:16,193 --> 01:34:18,866
The robes of that office
would not have suited me.

1579
01:34:19,073 --> 01:34:19,869
Wouldn't they?

1580
01:34:20,113 --> 01:34:23,344
I intend to have Curry censured
for revealing a confidence.

1581
01:34:23,553 --> 01:34:26,226
I ask you never to divulge it
to another soul.

1582
01:34:26,433 --> 01:34:27,912
I'd like you to forget it.

1583
01:34:28,113 --> 01:34:31,901
I shall never divulge it.
I can't promise to forget it myself.

1584
01:34:32,113 --> 01:34:34,673
If you choose to endow
an unimportant incident...

1585
01:34:34,913 --> 01:34:36,744
...with a romantic significance...

1586
01:34:36,953 --> 01:34:39,262
...you are perfectly at liberty
to do so.

1587
01:34:44,513 --> 01:34:46,344
Would you show me out another way?

1588
01:34:53,433 --> 01:34:54,263
Thank you.

1589
01:34:54,513 --> 01:34:55,662
There you are.

1590
01:34:56,273 --> 01:34:57,911
I say, Sir Robert...

1591
01:34:58,473 --> 01:35:01,465
...l'm sorry. I didn't know
anything was going to happen.

1592
01:35:03,313 --> 01:35:04,143
Where were you?

1593
01:35:04,353 --> 01:35:05,672
At the pictures.

1594
01:35:05,873 --> 01:35:07,943
-Pictures?
-Cinematograph.

1595
01:35:10,873 --> 01:35:13,341
I say, we won, didn't we?

1596
01:35:13,713 --> 01:35:15,271
Yes, we won.

1597
01:35:17,353 --> 01:35:18,945
How about that!

1598
01:35:19,793 --> 01:35:21,067
We won.

1599
01:35:25,833 --> 01:35:27,505
One thing puzzles me.

1600
01:35:27,713 --> 01:35:30,432
Why are you always at such pains
to prevent people...

1601
01:35:30,633 --> 01:35:32,749
...knowing the truth about you?

1602
01:35:32,953 --> 01:35:35,626
-Am l, indeed?
-You know that you are. Why?

1603
01:35:36,553 --> 01:35:39,272
-Who knows the truth about himself?
-That is no answer.

1604
01:35:39,473 --> 01:35:42,226
My dear Miss Winslow,
are you cross-examining me?

1605
01:35:42,713 --> 01:35:44,032
On this point.

1606
01:35:44,833 --> 01:35:47,393
Why are you ashamed of your emotions?

1607
01:35:47,593 --> 01:35:51,347
To fight a case on emotional grounds
is the surest way to lose it.

1608
01:35:51,593 --> 01:35:52,469
Is it?

1609
01:35:52,713 --> 01:35:54,465
Emotions cloud the issue.

1610
01:35:54,713 --> 01:35:56,943
Cold, clear logic wins the day.

1611
01:35:57,153 --> 01:36:00,862
Was it cold, clear logic that made you
weep today at the verdict?

1612
01:36:02,273 --> 01:36:03,911
I wept because right had been done.

1613
01:36:04,113 --> 01:36:06,024
-Not justice?
-No, not justice.

1614
01:36:06,473 --> 01:36:07,508
Right.

1615
01:36:08,433 --> 01:36:10,264
Easy to do justice.

1616
01:36:10,513 --> 01:36:12,424
Very hard to do right.

1617
01:36:17,153 --> 01:36:19,189
Now, I must leave the witness box.

1618
01:36:22,953 --> 01:36:26,104
Miss Winslow, I hope I shall
see you again.

1619
01:36:26,553 --> 01:36:28,225
One day in the House of Commons.

1620
01:36:28,553 --> 01:36:30,509
-Up in the gallery.
-Yes.

1621
01:36:30,713 --> 01:36:33,352
In the House of Commons,
but not up in the gallery.

1622
01:36:33,593 --> 01:36:35,709
Across the floor, one day.

1623
01:36:37,433 --> 01:36:39,901
You still pursue
your feminist activities.

1624
01:36:40,193 --> 01:36:41,626
Oh, yes.

1625
01:36:42,073 --> 01:36:43,222
Pity.

1626
01:36:44,753 --> 01:36:46,471
It's a lost cause.

1627
01:36:47,873 --> 01:36:52,264
Do you really think so, Sir Robert?
How little you know about women.

1628
01:36:52,513 --> 01:36:55,266
Goodbye. I doubt that we
shall meet again.

1629
01:36:55,513 --> 01:36:57,151
Do you really think so?

1630
01:36:58,633 --> 01:37:01,022
How little you know about men.

1631
01:40:08,233 --> 01:40:09,222
