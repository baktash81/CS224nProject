You know what I mean?

you told me about.

884
00:47:28,472 --> 00:47:32,006
You know, it ain't good
for her to know that
she can boss you around!

885
00:47:32,008 --> 00:47:35,009
Well, I don't smoke a pipe
and I don't wear no slippers.

886
00:47:35,011 --> 00:47:36,176
It's the decent thing...

887
00:47:36,178 --> 00:47:38,044
Scruggy, I'm
the expert, right, huh?

888
00:47:38,046 --> 00:47:40,079
Take it from me, man,
I've been married
three and a half times.

889
