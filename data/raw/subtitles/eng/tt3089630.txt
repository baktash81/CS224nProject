1
00:00:30,545 --> 00:00:32,046
Authorities worldwide

2
00:00:32,129 --> 00:00:33,673
expressed shock
at these allegations.

3
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:35,967
Most daring
thefts of modern times.

4
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,528
Fowl is said
to be hiding ancient relics

5
00:00:37,552 --> 00:00:38,654
worth hundreds of millions of...

6
00:00:38,678 --> 00:00:39,720
Time and again,

7
00:00:39,804 --> 00:00:42,390
these museums
were robbed of untold riches.

8
00:00:42,473 --> 00:00:43,575
Some say the true amount stolen

9
00:00:43,599 --> 00:00:44,642
may never be known.

10
00:00:44,725 --> 00:00:46,644
Where I am amidst
what can only be described

11
00:00:46,727 --> 00:00:48,229
as a media frenzy.

12
00:00:48,312 --> 00:00:50,249
He couldn't dismiss the fact
that when he was arrested...

13
00:00:50,273 --> 00:00:51,315
The collection contains

14
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:52,459
the rarest evidence
of ancient worlds.

15
00:00:52,483 --> 00:00:55,528
Most expressed horror at his
alleged criminal activity,

16
00:00:55,695 --> 00:00:58,614
while others hinted at a more
widespread conspiracy.

17
00:00:58,781 --> 00:00:59,824
Many similarities

18
00:00:59,907 --> 00:01:02,702
to numerous daring thefts
shrouded in mystery.

19
00:01:02,785 --> 00:01:04,078
A crowd has gathered...

20
00:01:04,161 --> 00:01:05,162
It's him! It's him!

21
00:01:05,246 --> 00:01:06,706
Breaking news.
There is the car.

22
00:01:06,873 --> 00:01:08,249
Yes, the car has come down.

23
00:01:08,332 --> 00:01:10,018
And it looks like
young Artemis Fowl is here.

24
00:01:10,042 --> 00:01:13,421
Authorities
have now made connections

25
00:01:13,504 --> 00:01:14,505
to one man.

26
00:01:14,672 --> 00:01:16,340
Artemis Fowl.

27
00:01:16,507 --> 00:01:17,633
Breaking news now

28
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,760
and a suspected accomplice
of Artemis Fowl

29
00:01:19,844 --> 00:01:21,220
is today arrested
near Fowl Manor.

30
00:01:21,304 --> 00:01:22,305
Help me.

31
00:01:22,388 --> 00:01:24,807
Is this
unidentified individual a link

32
00:01:24,891 --> 00:01:27,560
to Artemis Fowl
and the multiple thefts?

33
00:01:29,687 --> 00:01:30,813
We have reports

34
00:01:30,897 --> 00:01:32,332
that British intelligence
authorities

35
00:01:32,356 --> 00:01:34,692
are expected to question
the subject immediately.

36
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:36,027
Is it true?

37
00:01:36,194 --> 00:01:37,634
Do you have anything to say,
Artemis?

38
00:01:37,695 --> 00:01:38,946
How does it feel

39
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,630
to have a criminal
for a father, Artemis?

40
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,968
Your name?

41
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,471
Mulch Diggums.

42
00:02:03,638 --> 00:02:06,182
Exactly what were you doing
near Fowl Manor?

43
00:02:06,265 --> 00:02:07,266
So now it's illegal

44
00:02:07,391 --> 00:02:08,392
to go for a hike?

45
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:09,685
This was no hike.

46
00:02:10,186 --> 00:02:12,647
Unless you tell us exactly
what happened at Fowl Manor,

47
00:02:12,813 --> 00:02:14,690
you will be
permanently imprisoned.

48
00:02:14,857 --> 00:02:16,400
Wait, wait, wait.

49
00:02:16,567 --> 00:02:17,985
You don't want me.

50
00:02:18,152 --> 00:02:20,905
No. No, I'm just
a talented tunneler.

51
00:02:21,364 --> 00:02:23,658
You want the brains
of the operation.

52
00:02:24,242 --> 00:02:26,619
The one who stole the Aculos.

53
00:02:26,786 --> 00:02:29,038
What, precisely, is the Aculos?

54
00:02:29,622 --> 00:02:31,082
The Aculos.

55
00:02:31,249 --> 00:02:34,210
A weapon
so powerful and mysterious,

56
00:02:34,293 --> 00:02:35,711
it can barely be imagined.

57
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:37,046
You're lying.

58
00:02:37,213 --> 00:02:38,607
Look, I know
you don't believe my story,

59
00:02:38,631 --> 00:02:39,632
but I can prove it.

60
00:02:39,715 --> 00:02:42,093
Mr. Diggums,
I highly doubt that.

61
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,554
You will see.

62
00:02:44,637 --> 00:02:45,721
All I see is

63
00:02:45,847 --> 00:02:47,825
that there was some highly
unusual seismic activity

64
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:49,350
around Fowl Manor

65
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:52,019
and reports from a crazed
fisherman of fairies.

66
00:02:52,186 --> 00:02:56,107
Well, maybe the fisherman saw
something he wasn't meant to.

67
00:02:56,274 --> 00:02:57,275
It's fantasy.

68
00:02:57,441 --> 00:02:59,277
What's reality is that
you are a common thief

69
00:02:59,443 --> 00:03:02,029
who is somehow in league
with a quite uncommon thief.

70
00:03:02,196 --> 00:03:04,907
We want to know everything
about the man you work for.

71
00:03:05,074 --> 00:03:06,242
The man?

72
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:08,244
No.

73
00:03:08,661 --> 00:03:10,621
This isn't about the father.

74
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,207
This is about the son.

75
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:14,959
The son?

76
00:03:15,126 --> 00:03:18,045
Do not underestimate the kid.

77
00:03:19,463 --> 00:03:21,799
Let me show you

78
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:26,345
the infinite possibilities
of magic.

79
00:03:27,305 --> 00:03:29,515
Let me tell you

80
00:03:29,682 --> 00:03:33,186
the story of Artemis Fowl.

81
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:42,945
A story that begins where
every great story begins,

82
00:03:43,112 --> 00:03:46,949
in a place where magic
and wonder still exist.

83
00:03:47,116 --> 00:03:49,452
The most magical place on Earth.

84
00:03:50,036 --> 00:03:51,245
Ireland.

85
00:03:51,412 --> 00:03:54,207
Home of Artemis Fowl.

86
00:04:37,834 --> 00:04:39,961
Artemis loved Ireland.

87
00:04:44,715 --> 00:04:47,718
The sea and the land.

88
00:04:47,885 --> 00:04:50,137
Not so much the school.

89
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,894
You see, he just didn't need it.

90
00:04:57,061 --> 00:04:58,062
When he was seven,

91
00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:00,481
he beat European
chess champion Evan Rashoggi

92
00:05:00,565 --> 00:05:02,066
in five moves.

93
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:04,569
When he was nine, he won
the architectural competition

94
00:05:04,735 --> 00:05:06,529
to design
the Dublin Opera House.

95
00:05:06,696 --> 00:05:08,030
When he was ten,

96
00:05:08,114 --> 00:05:10,157
he cloned a goat
and named it Bruce.

97
00:05:10,324 --> 00:05:11,909
Weird choice,
but he's an unusual kid.

98
00:05:11,993 --> 00:05:12,994
Good.

99
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:17,164
And you know
when you're that unusual,

100
00:05:17,331 --> 00:05:19,000
you're going to stick out.

101
00:05:23,546 --> 00:05:26,424
Well, Artemis,
let's talk, shall we?

102
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:27,592
Certainly, sir.

103
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,597
I can see
you're admiring my chair.

104
00:05:33,723 --> 00:05:35,224
It's a family heirloom.

105
00:05:35,391 --> 00:05:38,352
Grandfather acquired it
from Sotheby's.

106
00:05:38,936 --> 00:05:40,354
William and Mary period,

107
00:05:40,438 --> 00:05:43,774
1689 to 1702,
as I'm sure you know.

108
00:05:44,317 --> 00:05:45,401
Impressive.

109
00:05:45,568 --> 00:05:48,487
Once in use at the palace,
Buckingham Palace.

110
00:05:48,654 --> 00:05:50,406
Queen's favorite chair,
apparently.

111
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,492
Now, Artemis,
there is a problem.

112
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:55,828
The problem is that
I know the textbook reply

113
00:05:55,912 --> 00:05:57,788
to any question
you may choose to ask.

114
00:05:57,955 --> 00:06:00,416
The problem is that you don't
respect anyone enough

115
00:06:00,499 --> 00:06:02,126
to treat them as an equal.

116
00:06:02,293 --> 00:06:03,853
That's ridiculous.
I hold several people

117
00:06:03,878 --> 00:06:04,962
in the very highest esteem.

118
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:07,632
Really? Who, for example?

119
00:06:07,798 --> 00:06:09,008
Albert Einstein.

120
00:06:09,175 --> 00:06:10,968
His theories
were usually correct.

121
00:06:12,595 --> 00:06:14,972
How about someone
you actually know?

122
00:06:17,517 --> 00:06:19,393
You seem to have
all the answers, Doctor.

123
00:06:19,477 --> 00:06:20,561
Why don't you tell me?

124
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:21,938
Well,

125
00:06:22,104 --> 00:06:23,648
where shall we start?

126
00:06:23,814 --> 00:06:26,526
That's my biography, I presume?

127
00:06:26,692 --> 00:06:29,445
It is.
It explains quite a lot.

128
00:06:29,654 --> 00:06:30,947
Such as?

129
00:06:31,113 --> 00:06:32,615
Well, firstly,

130
00:06:32,698 --> 00:06:35,117
there's your dear mother,
of course.

131
00:06:35,868 --> 00:06:38,996
Who was a wonderful woman,
in my opinion,

132
00:06:39,163 --> 00:06:42,041
and taken from us far too soon,

133
00:06:42,917 --> 00:06:46,796
but who sadly had absolutely
no control over your behavior.

134
00:06:48,548 --> 00:06:51,592
Then, of course,
there's your father

135
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,096
and his mysterious absences
from home.

136
00:06:56,305 --> 00:06:58,432
This is a sensitive area,
Doctor.

137
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,395
But do you think
that's why you are as you are?

138
00:07:03,396 --> 00:07:04,397
No.

139
00:07:04,564 --> 00:07:05,666
And by the way, I didn't know

140
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,358
they allowed fakes
at the palace.

141
00:07:07,525 --> 00:07:08,693
- Fake?
- It's clever,

142
00:07:08,776 --> 00:07:09,777
I'll give you that.

143
00:07:09,944 --> 00:07:11,362
But look at these
furniture tacks.

144
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:13,030
Crisscross pattern on the head.

145
00:07:13,114 --> 00:07:14,115
Machine-tooled.

146
00:07:14,282 --> 00:07:17,285
Makes it 1890s at the earliest.

147
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:18,786
Your grandfather was duped.

148
00:07:18,953 --> 00:07:20,705
Artemis,
you're lashing out at me,

149
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:22,790
but I think I know
what this is really about.

150
00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:26,711
Is it because of the burden
of your father's name?

151
00:07:27,837 --> 00:07:28,838
No.

152
00:07:29,338 --> 00:07:31,048
It's because
I'm forced to endure

153
00:07:31,132 --> 00:07:32,717
this ridiculous therapy.

154
00:07:33,176 --> 00:07:34,218
Artemis?

155
00:07:34,677 --> 00:07:36,846
Look! Just who do you think
you are?

156
00:07:40,266 --> 00:07:43,269
But, of course,
Artemis wasn't on his own,

157
00:07:43,436 --> 00:07:46,814
even if it may have seemed
that way sometimes.

158
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,367
For if there was one thing
Artemis liked

159
00:07:58,451 --> 00:08:00,369
more than his own company,

160
00:08:00,536 --> 00:08:04,373
it was being at home
with his dad.

161
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,503
Artemis Fowl, Sr.,

162
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:11,672
a dealer
of antiques and rarities

163
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:14,175
and just about
every Irish fairy tale

164
00:08:14,258 --> 00:08:16,177
you might care to imagine.

165
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,621
They're trained in the art of...

166
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:28,564
Except that
you didn't have to imagine,

167
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:31,192
for Artemis Sr.
Taught Artemis Jr.

168
00:08:31,275 --> 00:08:32,395
Everything there was to know

169
00:08:32,485 --> 00:08:34,779
about the leprechauns
and the banshees

170
00:08:34,946 --> 00:08:38,407
and the sprites and the goblins.

171
00:08:38,574 --> 00:08:40,618
So much so that you might
even have thought

172
00:08:40,785 --> 00:08:42,411
that Artemis Sr. believed

173
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,289
in the legends
of the little people.

174
00:08:45,456 --> 00:08:47,583
He certainly shared
his passion with his son

175
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:48,709
on the rare occasions

176
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:50,962
when he wasn't away from home.

177
00:08:51,128 --> 00:08:52,505
But while he was there,

178
00:08:52,672 --> 00:08:55,508
he was absolutely determined
to have Artemis know

179
00:08:55,675 --> 00:08:58,344
all that could be known
about the fairies.

180
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:02,849
To prepare the boy for a day
that would come much sooner

181
00:09:03,015 --> 00:09:04,350
than anyone expected.

182
00:09:06,477 --> 00:09:08,121
Did I ever tell you
how all those fairy stones

183
00:09:08,145 --> 00:09:09,185
got to come to Fowl Manor?

184
00:09:10,815 --> 00:09:11,816
Thousands of years ago,

185
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:13,484
this is where
the peace was made.

186
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:15,611
After the war
between the human world

187
00:09:15,695 --> 00:09:16,863
and the Tuatha De Danaan,

188
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:18,739
a human and a fairy met...

189
00:09:18,906 --> 00:09:21,033
Just tell me
when you're leaving.

190
00:09:25,496 --> 00:09:26,497
The helicopter's

191
00:09:26,622 --> 00:09:27,683
being prepared
for me right now, son.

192
00:09:27,707 --> 00:09:29,142
I'm sorry.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

193
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,519
That's what you said
the last time,

194
00:09:30,543 --> 00:09:31,794
and the time before.

195
00:09:31,961 --> 00:09:34,172
I know, Arty.

196
00:09:34,338 --> 00:09:37,466
There's just one very
important thing I have to do.

197
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:38,843
And I know it's been hard,

198
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:41,304
but, look,
my work is coming to an end.

199
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,847
And like the stories, you know,

200
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,682
they all have an ending
that just...

201
00:09:46,184 --> 00:09:48,019
Well, it makes you smile.

202
00:09:49,478 --> 00:09:51,480
And this one
will be no different.

203
00:09:51,647 --> 00:09:54,400
And when it ends,
a new story will begin.

204
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:56,277
And maybe,

205
00:09:56,444 --> 00:09:57,820
just maybe,

206
00:09:58,446 --> 00:09:59,655
it'll be yours.

207
00:09:59,822 --> 00:10:00,990
I'm not a kid anymore, Dad.

208
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:04,744
Well, you used to
believe in magic.

209
00:10:04,911 --> 00:10:06,078
You believed in the goblins,

210
00:10:06,162 --> 00:10:07,496
and you believed in the trolls.

211
00:10:07,622 --> 00:10:08,849
You believed in everything
I told you

212
00:10:08,873 --> 00:10:10,124
about the Hill of Tara.

213
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,210
All I really want

214
00:10:13,044 --> 00:10:14,629
is to believe in you.

215
00:10:19,717 --> 00:10:20,801
Okay.

216
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:25,932
Come here, son.

217
00:10:32,021 --> 00:10:33,356
I love you, son.

218
00:10:34,398 --> 00:10:35,983
More than you could ever know.

219
00:10:38,694 --> 00:10:40,279
Then take me with you.

220
00:10:42,323 --> 00:10:44,534
You're all I have now, Arty.

221
00:10:45,326 --> 00:10:47,620
Let me keep you safe
for a little longer.

222
00:10:53,543 --> 00:10:54,794
Come on.

223
00:11:28,911 --> 00:11:32,331
And remember,
until I see you again,

224
00:11:32,415 --> 00:11:34,375
may the road rise up
to meet you.

225
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:37,378
May the wind
be always at your back.

226
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:40,882
May the sun shine
warm upon your face.

227
00:11:41,048 --> 00:11:44,135
May the rain fall soft
upon your fields.

228
00:11:44,302 --> 00:11:46,262
And until we meet again,

229
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,473
may a friend be always near.

230
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,934
Good night, son.

231
00:11:52,101 --> 00:11:53,436
Good night, Dad.

232
00:12:13,581 --> 00:12:14,916
What are you talking about?

233
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:19,295
Yes, he took off yesterday,
as planned.

234
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:25,551
What do you mean,
he never arrived?

235
00:12:25,718 --> 00:12:27,053
The boat was empty.

236
00:12:27,512 --> 00:12:29,096
Have you checked the manifest?

237
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:33,434
How long
before the media have it?

238
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:36,229
I don't know. You'd better
make some inquiries.

239
00:12:40,525 --> 00:12:41,817
Domovoi Butler.

240
00:12:41,984 --> 00:12:43,819
Friend, mentor, bodyguard.

241
00:12:43,986 --> 00:12:46,072
Ten years of martial arts
training in Kyoto,

242
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:47,907
seven years of
weapons training in Moscow,

243
00:12:48,074 --> 00:12:49,259
six years of strength training

244
00:12:49,283 --> 00:12:51,160
at Gold's Gym in Venice,
California.

245
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,870
And under no circumstances

246
00:12:52,954 --> 00:12:54,789
were you to ever call him
"The Butler"

247
00:12:54,956 --> 00:12:57,458
even though his last name
was in fact "Butler."

248
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,086
You could call him "Dom,"
or "Domovoi,"

249
00:13:00,253 --> 00:13:02,171
or "Very large man in a suit,"

250
00:13:02,338 --> 00:13:05,800
but call him "The Butler,"
and he'd snap you in half.

251
00:13:06,384 --> 00:13:07,802
Not always sunny, though.

252
00:13:07,969 --> 00:13:09,262
There will be some cloud

253
00:13:09,345 --> 00:13:11,389
that'll bring a few drizzles
now and again,

254
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:14,058
especially along the western
and northern coast.

255
00:13:14,225 --> 00:13:15,852
Now back to our main story.

256
00:13:17,436 --> 00:13:19,272
Authorities today launched

257
00:13:19,355 --> 00:13:22,275
a worldwide manhunt
for Artemis Fowl.

258
00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:23,609
A reclusive businessman,

259
00:13:23,693 --> 00:13:25,736
but now
a controversial public figure

260
00:13:25,903 --> 00:13:27,530
whose superyacht, the Owl Star,

261
00:13:27,613 --> 00:13:29,323
was found abandoned last night

262
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,992
in the South China seas.

263
00:13:31,158 --> 00:13:34,495
Fowl is a known collector
and antiquities dealer,

264
00:13:34,662 --> 00:13:36,080
but in dramatic new revelations,

265
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:38,416
he is also suspected
to have been behind

266
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:41,586
some of the biggest robberies
of the past 10 years,

267
00:13:41,752 --> 00:13:44,714
including the disappearance
of the priceless Rosetta Stone

268
00:13:44,881 --> 00:13:46,299
from the British Museum,

269
00:13:46,465 --> 00:13:49,719
the irreplaceable 14th century
Boru's harp,

270
00:13:49,886 --> 00:13:52,763
and the iconic Book of Kells
from Trinity College, Dublin.

271
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,892
No sign of struggle was found
aboard the Owl Star

272
00:13:56,058 --> 00:13:58,477
and her owner's fate
is entirely unknown.

273
00:13:58,644 --> 00:14:00,688
Investigations are ongoing,

274
00:14:00,855 --> 00:14:02,607
but until further news
of his whereabouts

275
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,567
can be established,
doubts will remain.

276
00:14:04,734 --> 00:14:06,194
My dad.

277
00:14:08,696 --> 00:14:10,573
- Artemis.
- Where is he, Dom?

278
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,283
We don't know.
I have people on the way

279
00:14:12,366 --> 00:14:13,367
to the wreck as we speak.

280
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:15,703
And the remaining question...

281
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,455
Artemis Fowl,

282
00:14:17,622 --> 00:14:21,292
antiquities dealer
or criminal mastermind?

283
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:22,835
How dare they!

284
00:14:23,002 --> 00:14:25,254
He's not a criminal!
He's my dad!

285
00:14:25,421 --> 00:14:27,131
He's my dad!

286
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,010
Dad!

287
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:37,517
Artemis, don't answer the phone!

288
00:14:38,726 --> 00:14:40,603
- Artemis!
- Dad!

289
00:14:44,315 --> 00:14:46,108
Hello? Dad?

290
00:14:47,401 --> 00:14:48,528
Hello?

291
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:52,615
Artemis Jr., I presume.

292
00:14:52,782 --> 00:14:54,617
I have your father.

293
00:14:55,284 --> 00:14:56,953
What? Who is this?

294
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:58,120
Is this a hoax?

295
00:14:58,287 --> 00:14:59,914
If you have my father,
I want proof.

296
00:15:00,248 --> 00:15:02,124
Then you shall have some.

297
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,751
Dad? Dad?

298
00:15:03,835 --> 00:15:04,836
Artemis.

299
00:15:05,837 --> 00:15:06,879
Artemis.

300
00:15:06,963 --> 00:15:08,798
You listen to me, son,
you stay out of this.

301
00:15:08,965 --> 00:15:10,007
Okay? Do you hear me?

302
00:15:10,091 --> 00:15:11,235
There's no way you can help me.

303
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:12,260
It's too big.

304
00:15:12,426 --> 00:15:14,306
Everything I've told you
is true. It's all true!

305
00:15:14,428 --> 00:15:16,681
Your father stole something
from me and hid it.

306
00:15:16,848 --> 00:15:19,809
My enemies have prevented me
from retrieving it myself.

307
00:15:19,976 --> 00:15:21,143
You will do so on my behalf.

308
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:24,063
Find the Aculos, or you will
never see him again.

309
00:15:24,814 --> 00:15:25,857
Artemis!

310
00:15:26,023 --> 00:15:27,316
What's the Aculos?

311
00:15:27,483 --> 00:15:28,943
You're a clever boy.

312
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,486
You'll work it out.

313
00:15:30,653 --> 00:15:32,780
You have three days.

314
00:15:32,947 --> 00:15:34,323
Artemis, what did they say?

315
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,491
Word for word.

316
00:15:37,076 --> 00:15:38,077
Whoever it was...

317
00:15:38,244 --> 00:15:39,537
- Man? Woman?
- I couldn't tell.

318
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,348
But they were asking for
something called the Aculos.

319
00:15:41,372 --> 00:15:42,373
What is it?

320
00:15:44,542 --> 00:15:47,253
Artemis, get dressed
and come with me.

321
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:55,094
You weren't supposed
to see this yet.

322
00:16:13,654 --> 00:16:16,532
Your father would kill me
if he knew we were here.

323
00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:19,285
I'm showing you
because I have no choice.

324
00:16:19,452 --> 00:16:20,745
What is all this?

325
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,871
This is where your father

326
00:16:21,954 --> 00:16:23,664
kept his entire life's work.

327
00:16:23,831 --> 00:16:26,584
And his father,
and his father before him.

328
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:29,879
It's not what it looks like,
Artemis.

329
00:16:30,046 --> 00:16:31,446
Everything in this room
was acquired

330
00:16:31,506 --> 00:16:32,924
for a specific reason.

331
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:35,593
Sometimes to protect
its secrets,

332
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,596
sometimes to keep it from
falling into the wrong hands.

333
00:16:38,763 --> 00:16:41,098
These are relics
from another world.

334
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:43,017
I don't understand.

335
00:16:43,184 --> 00:16:44,352
I was never meant to share

336
00:16:44,435 --> 00:16:45,835
the details
of your family business.

337
00:16:46,187 --> 00:16:47,772
These relics
have been passed down

338
00:16:47,855 --> 00:16:49,106
through the generations.

339
00:16:49,273 --> 00:16:50,459
They're secrets that your father

340
00:16:50,483 --> 00:16:51,943
had intended to share with you

341
00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:53,402
when the time was right.

342
00:16:53,569 --> 00:16:54,904
But the fairies are a myth.

343
00:16:55,071 --> 00:16:56,271
None of this is actually true.

344
00:16:56,697 --> 00:16:58,282
Look around you, Arty.

345
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:01,994
Maybe those stories
can help us find him.

346
00:17:04,163 --> 00:17:05,831
But where to begin?

347
00:17:05,998 --> 00:17:08,417
I don't see anything
about an Aculos, do you?

348
00:17:08,584 --> 00:17:09,585
No.

349
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:11,337
I helped him catalogue
much of this,

350
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,820
but he never mentioned
such a thing.

351
00:17:12,964 --> 00:17:15,341
And he always shared
his discoveries with me.

352
00:17:15,508 --> 00:17:17,718
The only thing he kept private
was his journal.

353
00:17:17,885 --> 00:17:19,387
Then that's what
we have to find.

354
00:17:19,804 --> 00:17:21,556
I wouldn't know
where to begin to look.

355
00:17:21,931 --> 00:17:23,891
Could your father
have ever given you a clue

356
00:17:23,975 --> 00:17:25,643
as to where to start?

357
00:17:26,102 --> 00:17:27,979
He never told me how to start,

358
00:17:28,855 --> 00:17:30,648
but he may have told me
how to end.

359
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:34,569
- End?
- Yeah.

360
00:17:34,735 --> 00:17:36,779
He read the same poem to me
every night before bed

361
00:17:36,946 --> 00:17:38,739
and every time he left.

362
00:17:39,866 --> 00:17:41,909
"May the road rise up
to meet you.

363
00:17:42,076 --> 00:17:43,953
"May the wind
be always at your back.

364
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,039
"May the sun shine
warm upon your face."

365
00:17:50,209 --> 00:17:52,962
"May the rains fall soft
upon your fields."

366
00:17:55,339 --> 00:17:56,924
Who wrote this poem, Arty?

367
00:17:57,967 --> 00:17:58,968
Nobody knows.

368
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,970
That's just it.

369
00:18:01,053 --> 00:18:02,054
Then how do you find it?

370
00:18:03,347 --> 00:18:05,308
It's known
as "The Irish Blessing."

371
00:18:08,895 --> 00:18:09,937
It's a journal.

372
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:11,731
It's Dad's journal.

373
00:18:11,898 --> 00:18:13,441
Go to the last entry.

374
00:18:19,655 --> 00:18:22,658
"She's hunting me now
and would kill me to find it.

375
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:23,868
"She knows the truth of

376
00:18:23,951 --> 00:18:25,471
"what Beechwood gave me
before he died.

377
00:18:25,536 --> 00:18:27,622
"They know
we have the Aculos."

378
00:18:27,788 --> 00:18:30,082
The voice on the phone
told you to find it.

379
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,919
"The Aculos cannot fall
into the wrong hands.

380
00:18:33,085 --> 00:18:34,420
"It had to be protected,

381
00:18:34,504 --> 00:18:36,631
"even from
the fairies themselves.

382
00:18:37,548 --> 00:18:38,925
"Time to believe."

383
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:41,052
Time to believe in fairies?

384
00:18:41,677 --> 00:18:43,221
But they're not real.

385
00:18:45,097 --> 00:18:46,265
Are they?

386
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,521
But as Artemis
would soon find out,

387
00:18:51,604 --> 00:18:53,022
they are very real

388
00:18:53,189 --> 00:18:54,982
and they've been living
right under your feet

389
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:56,943
for 1,000 years.

390
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:01,239
And their cities
at the center of the Earth

391
00:19:01,322 --> 00:19:03,658
are not something
out of a storybook.

392
00:19:04,992 --> 00:19:06,577
No.

393
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:09,830
They are just as real as you.

394
00:19:10,498 --> 00:19:14,043
Diverse and strange
and beautiful.

395
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,670
Ladies and gentlemen,

396
00:19:15,795 --> 00:19:18,548
welcome to the wondrous,
thriving metropolis

397
00:19:18,631 --> 00:19:20,925
that is Haven City,

398
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,846
home of the fairies.

399
00:19:36,148 --> 00:19:37,149
You have now arrived

400
00:19:37,233 --> 00:19:38,401
at Haven City Central,

401
00:19:38,568 --> 00:19:40,319
this transporter's terminus.

402
00:19:40,486 --> 00:19:42,697
Please make sure you take
all your belongings with you

403
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,282
before leaving the transporter.

404
00:19:44,448 --> 00:19:45,575
Officer Holly Short,

405
00:19:45,658 --> 00:19:47,243
two minutes
to security briefing.

406
00:19:49,537 --> 00:19:51,080
Do it with Koboi.

407
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:52,623
Shuttles to the surface...

408
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,208
We bring you
a community leader...

409
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,252
Our main story this morning.

410
00:19:56,419 --> 00:19:57,795
As a second week passes,

411
00:19:57,879 --> 00:20:00,089
there is still no sign
of the Aculos.

412
00:20:00,256 --> 00:20:02,008
Fears are rising.

413
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,926
However, authorities assure us

414
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,928
the crisis
will be swiftly handled.

415
00:20:06,095 --> 00:20:08,139
Even so, doubts are mounting.

416
00:20:26,032 --> 00:20:27,200
Yeah. Thank you.

417
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:42,924
See, this is my favorite part.

418
00:20:43,382 --> 00:20:45,343
Mainly because I'm in it.

419
00:20:47,094 --> 00:20:48,804
Keep an eye out, brothers.

420
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:50,681
We dwarves gotta watch
each other's backs,

421
00:20:50,765 --> 00:20:51,766
am I right?

422
00:20:51,933 --> 00:20:53,684
Lay low,
I'll get us out of here.

423
00:20:53,851 --> 00:20:54,852
You're not a dwarf.

424
00:20:54,977 --> 00:20:57,146
- No, I am, I'm a dwarf.
- No, you're not.

425
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:58,940
I am a giant dwarf.

426
00:20:59,815 --> 00:21:01,776
You've got a big mouth
for a dwarf.

427
00:21:02,652 --> 00:21:05,655
You won't talk so much
at Howler's Peak.

428
00:21:05,821 --> 00:21:08,282
That's where we goblins
do the talking.

429
00:21:09,116 --> 00:21:11,786
And what we say goes.

430
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:14,080
Next!

431
00:21:15,915 --> 00:21:16,999
Hi there, gents.

432
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,252
Mulch Diggums.

433
00:21:19,836 --> 00:21:21,462
Two G's in Diggums.

434
00:21:22,171 --> 00:21:23,548
Tunneling and entering.

435
00:21:23,714 --> 00:21:25,716
Repeat offender. 400 years.

436
00:21:25,883 --> 00:21:27,385
Yeah, that sounds about right.

437
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:30,221
Hey, hey, hey.
Knock it off. Knock it off.

438
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:32,974
Knock it off!

439
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:37,854
Next! Move!

440
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,063
Officer Short.

441
00:21:39,438 --> 00:21:40,606
Good to see you.

442
00:21:41,065 --> 00:21:42,525
What are you in
for this time, Mulch?

443
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:43,901
Tunneling and entering.

444
00:21:43,985 --> 00:21:45,087
Put in a good word for me,
will you?

445
00:21:45,111 --> 00:21:46,153
You know I'm an artist.

446
00:21:46,237 --> 00:21:47,530
Yeah. A con artist.

447
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:49,740
Art is art. Great artists
are never understood.

448
00:21:49,907 --> 00:21:52,660
Hey, you and I would make
a great team, you know?

449
00:21:52,827 --> 00:21:55,079
Me cracking safes,
tunneling into banks,

450
00:21:55,246 --> 00:21:56,372
you watching my back

451
00:21:56,455 --> 00:21:58,135
with your tiny
but effective fairy weapons.

452
00:21:58,165 --> 00:21:59,292
That's your plan?

453
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:00,727
Less of a plan,
more of a lifestyle choice.

454
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:02,128
By the way, this your wallet?

455
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:04,255
Stop picking my pockets!

456
00:22:04,422 --> 00:22:06,174
Think of my children, Holly.

457
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,780
- You don't have children.
- Not yet.

458
00:22:08,301 --> 00:22:09,510
Prisoner for processing.

459
00:22:09,677 --> 00:22:11,929
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, don't go yet.

460
00:22:12,096 --> 00:22:13,306
We're the same, you know?

461
00:22:13,472 --> 00:22:16,726
Your last name is Short.
My whole body is short.

462
00:22:16,893 --> 00:22:18,102
You're not short.

463
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:19,687
I keep telling you that.

464
00:22:20,438 --> 00:22:22,106
That's just discriminatory.

465
00:22:22,273 --> 00:22:25,610
I'll write it off as ignorance
because I love you!

466
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:27,028
And thanks for the music.

467
00:22:27,195 --> 00:22:28,571
Move it now.

468
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:30,239
I am very much a dwarf.

469
00:22:31,574 --> 00:22:32,909
Over here!

470
00:22:51,928 --> 00:22:53,930
Briar Cudgeon.

471
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,973
Is this about my appeal?

472
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,809
Yes, you will be
a commander again.

473
00:22:58,976 --> 00:23:01,020
All charges dropped.

474
00:23:01,187 --> 00:23:02,522
I've convinced the executors

475
00:23:02,605 --> 00:23:05,441
to grant a pardon
after your court-martial.

476
00:23:06,108 --> 00:23:09,445
Commander Root
was powerless to stop it.

477
00:23:10,238 --> 00:23:11,489
Who are you?

478
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,741
My fairy godmother?

479
00:23:14,242 --> 00:23:18,329
Yes, only now you work for me.

480
00:23:18,496 --> 00:23:19,914
The Fowl boy is in play,

481
00:23:19,997 --> 00:23:21,397
and I want nothing
that prevents him

482
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:23,209
from bringing me the Aculos.

483
00:23:23,376 --> 00:23:26,921
You will infiltrate
Fairy Command on my behalf.

484
00:23:27,088 --> 00:23:28,506
I spy?

485
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,508
You spy or you die.

486
00:23:45,565 --> 00:23:47,275
Morning, Shorty.

487
00:23:52,321 --> 00:23:54,156
LEPRECON!

488
00:23:58,327 --> 00:24:00,222
Commander! What are all
these rumors about the Aculos?

489
00:24:00,246 --> 00:24:01,789
Knock it off!

490
00:24:03,082 --> 00:24:04,375
You've seen the news.

491
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:07,170
The Aculos is still missing.

492
00:24:07,336 --> 00:24:10,464
Kelp, Verbil, B Squad, C Squad,

493
00:24:10,548 --> 00:24:13,050
you're all
on triple night duty downtown.

494
00:24:14,427 --> 00:24:17,513
The delicate balance of peace
in our world

495
00:24:17,597 --> 00:24:19,557
now hangs by a narrow thread.

496
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:23,060
Until the Aculos
is safely returned,

497
00:24:23,227 --> 00:24:26,647
our entire civilization
is at risk

498
00:24:26,814 --> 00:24:28,065
from the humans

499
00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:31,319
or from enemies
amongst our own kind.

500
00:24:31,485 --> 00:24:34,989
There is a dark force at work,
and it will stop at nothing

501
00:24:35,156 --> 00:24:37,200
until it has the Aculos.

502
00:24:38,242 --> 00:24:40,203
So keep your eyes peeled.

503
00:24:41,245 --> 00:24:43,247
See it and report it.

504
00:24:44,207 --> 00:24:49,587
We must recover the Aculos
and protect our anonymity.

505
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:54,217
For the peace to remain,
so must our secret existence.

506
00:24:54,383 --> 00:24:56,636
Preserve that at all costs.

507
00:24:56,802 --> 00:24:57,970
Jeopardize it,

508
00:24:58,054 --> 00:25:01,516
and I'll have you incarcerated
at Howler's Peak.

509
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:04,227
Any questions?

510
00:25:04,393 --> 00:25:06,270
No? Good.

511
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:07,813
Get to work.

512
00:25:09,065 --> 00:25:10,274
Commander Root!

513
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,568
Yes, what is it?

514
00:25:13,361 --> 00:25:15,696
Commander, I have
a new lead on my father.

515
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,989
He was at the Hill of Tara.

516
00:25:17,156 --> 00:25:18,950
- You're not going.
- But, Commander...

517
00:25:19,116 --> 00:25:20,159
That's an order.

518
00:25:20,243 --> 00:25:21,285
Not a request.

519
00:25:21,452 --> 00:25:22,620
Yes, Commander.

520
00:25:29,335 --> 00:25:31,003
A word of advice.

521
00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:34,924
You're 84, you're young,

522
00:25:35,508 --> 00:25:38,135
you have your whole life
ahead of you.

523
00:25:38,928 --> 00:25:41,973
You'll have plenty of missions
to fly, Holly.

524
00:25:48,354 --> 00:25:50,481
And you can be a good officer.

525
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:54,151
Just don't make this personal.

526
00:25:58,281 --> 00:26:00,783
Let them take care
of the Aculos.

527
00:26:13,337 --> 00:26:15,006
With Artemis Sr. gone...

528
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:16,299
Let's go with backup.

529
00:26:16,465 --> 00:26:18,968
Domovoi knew
the stakes couldn't be higher.

530
00:26:19,135 --> 00:26:21,596
He knew he would need to
bring in some reinforcements.

531
00:26:21,762 --> 00:26:23,681
Someone he could trust
to watch his back

532
00:26:23,764 --> 00:26:25,725
to help protect Fowl Manor.

533
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:31,230
There was only one person
he knew

534
00:26:31,314 --> 00:26:33,858
who fully understood
tactical reconnaissance,

535
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:35,109
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu,

536
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,403
and the complicated mind
of a 12-year-old.

537
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,824
Another 12-year-old.

538
00:26:42,116 --> 00:26:45,578
His niece, Juliet Butler.

539
00:26:48,372 --> 00:26:49,540
No links found.

540
00:26:49,624 --> 00:26:50,625
Artemis.

541
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:51,834
The searching's important,

542
00:26:51,918 --> 00:26:53,198
but you can't forget the basics.

543
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:56,380
- Eat.
- There's no time.

544
00:26:56,547 --> 00:26:57,747
You've done 12 hours straight.

545
00:26:57,965 --> 00:26:59,717
It appears to be nowhere
in this house

546
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,427
- and yet it has to be.
- Zero matches.

547
00:27:01,928 --> 00:27:03,262
You're not giving up, are you?

548
00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:04,430
Of course not.

549
00:27:04,514 --> 00:27:05,782
But I think
I may know the problem.

550
00:27:05,806 --> 00:27:07,934
I'm not the one to find it.

551
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,602
So, how do we summon

552
00:27:09,685 --> 00:27:11,354
this mysterious finder
of Aculoses?

553
00:27:12,188 --> 00:27:14,273
The fairies,
of course. They'll help us.

554
00:27:14,774 --> 00:27:15,858
Will they?

555
00:27:16,025 --> 00:27:17,401
With a bit of persuasion.

556
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:19,904
And do you know where they are?

557
00:27:20,696 --> 00:27:21,948
In my father's journal,

558
00:27:22,031 --> 00:27:23,241
he wrote of a fairy

559
00:27:23,407 --> 00:27:25,660
who would periodically visit
the oak tree

560
00:27:25,743 --> 00:27:26,994
on the Hill of Tara.

561
00:27:27,161 --> 00:27:28,538
She's our best option,

562
00:27:28,621 --> 00:27:30,998
because their world,
it's too well hidden.

563
00:27:31,165 --> 00:27:32,375
And their books,

564
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:34,293
it's not
just a different language,

565
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,837
it's encoded.

566
00:27:40,591 --> 00:27:42,677
Of course it's encoded.

567
00:27:42,844 --> 00:27:44,679
By this guy. Foaly.

568
00:27:44,846 --> 00:27:46,889
Fairy tech genius and centaur.

569
00:27:46,973 --> 00:27:47,974
Foaly!

570
00:27:48,057 --> 00:27:49,392
Do not ask him for a ride.

571
00:27:49,475 --> 00:27:50,518
Hello, Holly.

572
00:27:50,601 --> 00:27:51,703
I learned that the hard way.

573
00:27:51,727 --> 00:27:52,937
Commander.

574
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,230
What is it, Foaly?

575
00:27:54,397 --> 00:27:55,565
We have a problem.

576
00:27:55,982 --> 00:27:58,609
One of ours is unaccounted for
on the surface.

577
00:27:58,776 --> 00:28:00,278
Elf? Dwarf? Goblin?

578
00:28:00,444 --> 00:28:03,155
Hard to tell. But it's big.

579
00:28:03,489 --> 00:28:05,491
Could be a deep-tunnel breakout.

580
00:28:05,658 --> 00:28:08,286
Perhaps through a fault
or dormant volcano.

581
00:28:08,452 --> 00:28:10,454
Send someone up to identify it.

582
00:28:13,416 --> 00:28:15,793
All active duty officers
are downtown

583
00:28:15,877 --> 00:28:17,086
searching for the Aculos.

584
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,091
- Officer Short.
- Yes, Commander.

585
00:28:22,258 --> 00:28:23,819
- I'm sending you up there.
- Yes, Commander.

586
00:28:23,843 --> 00:28:25,428
Identify, report,

587
00:28:25,511 --> 00:28:26,991
- but do not engage.
- Yes, Commander.

588
00:28:27,096 --> 00:28:28,097
- Clear?
- Crystal.

589
00:28:28,181 --> 00:28:29,408
- Go, go!
- Thank you, Commander.

590
00:28:29,432 --> 00:28:30,433
Commander.

591
00:28:34,061 --> 00:28:35,771
Two minutes until Lava Launch.

592
00:28:35,938 --> 00:28:38,482
Authorized personnel only
on the launch site.

593
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:40,809
This is the quickest way
we can take you to the surface

594
00:28:40,943 --> 00:28:42,195
so pay attention.

595
00:28:42,361 --> 00:28:44,780
You'll be sitting on 200,000
tons of molten lava

596
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,824
and traveling at over
600 miles an hour,

597
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:50,036
so don't get out
until I give the all-clear.

598
00:28:50,203 --> 00:28:51,662
Otherwise, it's...

599
00:28:52,246 --> 00:28:53,831
Goodbye, Holly.
Rest in pieces.

600
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:55,666
No need to sound
so excited about it.

601
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:58,336
What can I say?
I just love science.

602
00:29:01,088 --> 00:29:02,757
Um, Foaly?

603
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,301
Boy.

604
00:29:16,479 --> 00:29:17,897
Lava Launch

605
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,524
in 30 seconds and counting.

606
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,568
Stay shielded
once you're up there.

607
00:29:23,152 --> 00:29:25,571
- Total invisibility.
- Yes, Commander.

608
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:29,158
Magma flare in 12, 11...

609
00:29:29,325 --> 00:29:30,701
The last thing we need

610
00:29:30,868 --> 00:29:33,454
is a fairy sighting
on top of everything else.

611
00:29:33,621 --> 00:29:34,830
Hello, Commander.

612
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:37,124
This is not the time.

613
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:40,419
We have an unidentified runner
on the surface.

614
00:29:40,586 --> 00:29:42,088
Hold on
to your breakfast, Holly!

615
00:29:42,171 --> 00:29:43,589
This is gonna be a bumpy ride!

616
00:29:44,131 --> 00:29:45,211
Is this the best we can do?

617
00:29:45,967 --> 00:29:48,678
Send in the daughter of
Beechwood Short, the traitor?

618
00:29:48,845 --> 00:29:50,638
You're not fit to say his name.

619
00:29:56,853 --> 00:29:59,814
Beechwood Short used his magic
to steal the Aculos from us,

620
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:01,232
which, need I remind you,

621
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,526
is the most precious artifact
in our civilization.

622
00:30:04,151 --> 00:30:05,987
The Aculos was stolen
on your watch.

623
00:30:06,153 --> 00:30:09,031
He has put our entire people
in danger and disappeared.

624
00:30:09,198 --> 00:30:10,533
In my book, that's a traitor.

625
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,702
Get out, Cudgeon,
before I throw you out.

626
00:30:12,869 --> 00:30:15,079
The executors
are watching you, Root.

627
00:30:15,955 --> 00:30:18,583
And I am their eyes and ears.
And I see everything.

628
00:30:20,376 --> 00:30:21,460
Carry on.

629
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:33,514
Ejecting you now.

630
00:30:38,978 --> 00:30:42,148
Come on! Yes!

631
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:01,125
Artemis, I'm in position.

632
00:31:03,211 --> 00:31:06,005
Domovoi, anything to report
from the Hill of Tara?

633
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:10,551
- Yes. I'm freezing.
- Understood.

634
00:31:10,718 --> 00:31:13,262
Now, the oak tree's
where Dad saw that fairy,

635
00:31:13,346 --> 00:31:14,472
and for my plan to work,

636
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:15,723
we need her.

637
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,391
And what exactly is your plan?

638
00:31:17,558 --> 00:31:18,893
Keep watching.

639
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,144
Trust me.

640
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:21,521
Copy that.

641
00:31:23,731 --> 00:31:26,567
Head east
towards Martina Franca.

642
00:31:28,236 --> 00:31:30,238
Officer Short,
your orders are to

643
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:32,615
contain that thing
until Memory Wipe arrives.

644
00:31:32,782 --> 00:31:34,075
Is that understood?

645
00:31:34,242 --> 00:31:35,451
Yes, Commander.

646
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:54,345
Approaching Martina Franca.

647
00:32:41,767 --> 00:32:43,102
Runner located.

648
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:45,479
It's a full-sized troll!

649
00:32:45,646 --> 00:32:48,107
Pick on someone your own size!

650
00:32:59,035 --> 00:33:00,512
I want a Time Freeze
around that thing

651
00:33:00,536 --> 00:33:01,871
before anyone gets eaten.

652
00:33:02,038 --> 00:33:03,122
Are you sure, Commander?

653
00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:04,725
We'll need authorization
from the executors.

654
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:07,168
I'll take
full responsibility. Go!

655
00:33:07,335 --> 00:33:09,003
Time Freeze capsule released!

656
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:24,018
Do not use magic on that human.

657
00:33:24,185 --> 00:33:25,186
Do you read me?

658
00:33:25,353 --> 00:33:26,437
She's hurt.

659
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:33,444
Come on.

660
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:34,612
Come on!

661
00:33:36,239 --> 00:33:37,823
Go! Now!

662
00:33:43,204 --> 00:33:44,497
Time Freeze loading.

663
00:33:44,664 --> 00:33:47,083
Set focus
for interior paralysis only.

664
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,043
Leave these people alone!

665
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,014
Fire.

666
00:34:26,455 --> 00:34:28,124
Retrieval.

667
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:31,252
Get that thing
back where it belongs

668
00:34:31,961 --> 00:34:33,588
and mind-wipe all those humans

669
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:36,007
who think they've seen a fairy
or a troll.

670
00:34:50,271 --> 00:34:52,481
L.E.P., begin withdrawal.

671
00:34:56,152 --> 00:34:57,695
Good work, Officer Short.

672
00:34:57,778 --> 00:34:59,488
Now get yourself home
immediately.

673
00:34:59,655 --> 00:35:00,823
Yes, Commander.

674
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:03,451
That's an order.

675
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:09,749
Mind wipe complete.

676
00:35:09,832 --> 00:35:11,542
Prepare to release Time Freeze.

677
00:35:49,455 --> 00:35:50,706
Um, Commander Root,

678
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:53,459
it looks like Holly may be
taking a slight detour.

679
00:35:53,626 --> 00:35:54,794
Officer Short.

680
00:35:55,837 --> 00:35:57,004
Where are you going?

681
00:35:57,171 --> 00:35:59,173
To clear my father's name!

682
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,050
I'll have her badge for this.

683
00:36:01,217 --> 00:36:02,361
That's a bit harsh, isn't it?

684
00:36:02,385 --> 00:36:04,470
Shut up, Foaly,
or I'll have yours, too.

685
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:08,099
These are dangerous times.

686
00:36:08,641 --> 00:36:09,851
I've lost a friend

687
00:36:10,017 --> 00:36:11,370
and soon,
Artemis will begin to know

688
00:36:11,394 --> 00:36:13,521
the rumors about me
and the thefts.

689
00:36:14,063 --> 00:36:16,232
Is he ready for the truth?

690
00:36:16,399 --> 00:36:17,900
That a darkness threatens

691
00:36:17,984 --> 00:36:19,902
both the human
and the fairy worlds?

692
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:23,281
When Beechwood came to me,
I knew there was no choice.

693
00:36:23,906 --> 00:36:25,741
The Aculos was being targeted.

694
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:28,119
In the wrong hands,
it would mean access

695
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,121
to the greatest spells
in fairy lore.

696
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:33,165
One could teleport armies,
wipe out life.

697
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:36,836
The wrong hands
are now very close.

698
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,964
They belong
to a brilliant fairy.

699
00:36:41,007 --> 00:36:42,800
Perhaps the greatest
of them all.

700
00:36:43,217 --> 00:36:44,760
But gone to the bad.

701
00:36:45,344 --> 00:36:48,598
Name, Opal Koboi.

702
00:36:57,064 --> 00:36:58,065
You are now approaching

703
00:36:58,149 --> 00:36:59,192
the sacred Hill of Tara.

704
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:02,486
Coordinates 1-8-3-8-7.

705
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:04,655
Officer Short!
Return immediate...

706
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:05,990
Communication disabled.

707
00:37:17,627 --> 00:37:18,669
Wow.

708
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:26,511
Dom. The fairies.

709
00:37:27,136 --> 00:37:28,513
They're real.

710
00:37:33,893 --> 00:37:35,853
Everything my father said
was true.

711
00:37:59,126 --> 00:38:01,045
Reload. Quick! Quick!

712
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:03,214
Fire!

713
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:10,888
We got one.

714
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,367
Holly Short
just dropped off the grid.

715
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:14,517
I've lost sound and visual.

716
00:38:14,684 --> 00:38:16,143
I warned her not to disobey me.

717
00:38:16,644 --> 00:38:18,104
We can't rule out
an interception.

718
00:38:18,271 --> 00:38:19,939
Give me her last coordinates.

719
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:22,859
She just arrived on
the Hill of Tara in Ireland.

720
00:38:23,025 --> 00:38:24,068
I checked the maps.

721
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,115
The only human habitation
anywhere near it is...

722
00:38:26,195 --> 00:38:27,280
Fowl Manor.

723
00:38:27,446 --> 00:38:28,447
You know it?

724
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,033
Alert all personnel.

725
00:38:32,451 --> 00:38:34,662
I'm launching
a full-scale recovery.

726
00:38:34,996 --> 00:38:36,916
- All personnel, Commander?
- Land, sea, and air.

727
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:39,542
There's a fairy unaccounted
for in the real world.

728
00:38:39,709 --> 00:38:41,961
If the humans see it,
we'll lose everything.

729
00:38:42,128 --> 00:38:43,212
Dear me, Root.

730
00:38:43,379 --> 00:38:44,589
Are you losing your touch?

731
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,757
Errant trolls?
Abducted fairies?

732
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:47,842
Whatever next?

733
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:49,027
If the executors find out
about this,

734
00:38:49,051 --> 00:38:50,094
you'll be finished.

735
00:38:50,178 --> 00:38:52,597
Get the four-leaf clover
out of here.

736
00:39:05,651 --> 00:39:07,195
Not happy!

737
00:39:09,864 --> 00:39:11,282
And what if
you look one in the eye?

738
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:12,450
Don't.

739
00:39:12,867 --> 00:39:15,494
They're trained
in arts like telekinesis,

740
00:39:15,578 --> 00:39:17,371
hypnosis, and mesmerism.

741
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:18,623
Correct.

742
00:39:19,373 --> 00:39:20,374
So?

743
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:22,376
Defensive options?

744
00:39:22,919 --> 00:39:25,171
Humans should wear
reflective glasses

745
00:39:25,338 --> 00:39:28,174
in order to escape mind control.

746
00:39:28,341 --> 00:39:29,342
Good.

747
00:39:29,717 --> 00:39:31,260
What is unique about dwarves?

748
00:39:31,427 --> 00:39:32,553
Besides digging,

749
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:34,222
they're master thieves
and pickpockets.

750
00:39:34,722 --> 00:39:35,723
And why?

751
00:39:35,848 --> 00:39:37,034
They're obsessed with treasure

752
00:39:37,058 --> 00:39:38,476
and can't resist
searching for it.

753
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:44,815
Where am I?

754
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:46,192
I'm impressed.

755
00:39:46,567 --> 00:39:47,693
You speak English.

756
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,460
Speak English?
Of course I speak English.

757
00:39:49,529 --> 00:39:50,729
I thought you might be hungry.

758
00:39:51,072 --> 00:39:53,074
Look, I don't know
what fairies eat,

759
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:54,325
but I thought maybe salad?

760
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:55,535
Yeah, whatever.

761
00:39:55,701 --> 00:39:58,496
I bet you have beautiful eyes.

762
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,957
I wish I could see them.

763
00:40:01,123 --> 00:40:02,291
That's not going to work.

764
00:40:02,458 --> 00:40:03,626
We've got protection.

765
00:40:03,793 --> 00:40:05,273
Who are you?
What do you want from me?

766
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:06,379
You're part of the plan.

767
00:40:06,546 --> 00:40:08,005
- Who's in charge here?
- I am.

768
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:09,382
You're just a child.

769
00:40:09,549 --> 00:40:11,259
Welcome to Fowl Manor,
Officer Short.

770
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:13,886
- How do you know my name?
- It's on your helmet.

771
00:40:14,053 --> 00:40:15,263
But it's in Gnomish.

772
00:40:15,429 --> 00:40:17,181
Correct.
I've read all about you.

773
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:18,724
You've what?

774
00:40:18,891 --> 00:40:21,686
I'm here to officially
invite you into my home.

775
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:23,646
Invite me? You just shot me!

776
00:40:23,813 --> 00:40:25,565
You must now do
whatever I demand.

777
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,692
You'll have to
keep me here forever.

778
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:29,443
If that's what you want.

779
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:30,945
You'll never get away with this.

780
00:40:31,112 --> 00:40:32,572
My people will come for me.

781
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:36,784
That's what I hoped you'd say.

782
00:40:37,618 --> 00:40:38,870
This isn't over.

783
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:40,496
You expect us to believe

784
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,331
he did something this dangerous?

785
00:40:42,498 --> 00:40:45,668
He captured a living fairy.
What do you think?

786
00:40:45,835 --> 00:40:47,920
Try to imagine
if humans suddenly found out

787
00:40:48,004 --> 00:40:49,484
there was a world
of magical creatures

788
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:50,673
living beneath them.

789
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,550
Most human beings
are afraid of gluten.

790
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:54,594
How do you think
they'd handle goblins?

791
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,598
Artemis wanted the Aculos
to save his father's life.

792
00:40:58,764 --> 00:41:00,183
And at last, his master plan

793
00:41:00,266 --> 00:41:01,684
was starting to fall into place.

794
00:41:01,851 --> 00:41:03,269
He had his first piece.

795
00:41:03,436 --> 00:41:04,520
Bait.

796
00:41:04,687 --> 00:41:06,814
But now,
a storm was coming his way.

797
00:41:07,273 --> 00:41:08,816
And the fate
of both of our worlds

798
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,861
was in the hands
of young Artemis Fowl.

799
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:25,166
Artemis. Dom.

800
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:28,169
It's like
the whole world is ending.

801
00:41:28,336 --> 00:41:29,629
The fairies are doing it.

802
00:41:29,712 --> 00:41:31,255
They're creating a Time Freeze.

803
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:32,757
I beg your pardon?

804
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:34,342
It's a kind of temporal vacuum

805
00:41:34,509 --> 00:41:36,761
that they create
so they can operate

806
00:41:36,844 --> 00:41:38,262
unseen by the human eye.

807
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,890
I read about it
in Dad's journal.

808
00:41:41,057 --> 00:41:42,225
It's formidable.

809
00:41:42,391 --> 00:41:44,727
Einstein and Hawking were right.

810
00:41:44,894 --> 00:41:46,437
Time is bending all over.

811
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:48,189
Anything could happen now.

812
00:41:48,356 --> 00:41:49,774
Anything's possible.

813
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:51,025
And while it holds,

814
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:52,860
the perfect conditions
for an attack.

815
00:41:53,027 --> 00:41:54,278
Exactly.

816
00:42:00,076 --> 00:42:01,661
We just picked up
your friends arriving.

817
00:42:01,827 --> 00:42:02,995
Can't wait to meet them.

818
00:42:03,162 --> 00:42:04,539
You won't even see them.

819
00:42:04,705 --> 00:42:06,624
Whatever you're planning
will fail.

820
00:42:06,707 --> 00:42:08,376
Fairies do not negotiate.

821
00:42:10,545 --> 00:42:12,255
You can't win!

822
00:42:12,421 --> 00:42:13,923
We'll see about that.

823
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,555
Sweet.

824
00:42:21,347 --> 00:42:22,682
Incredible.

825
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,731
En garde!

826
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:33,568
You are so dead.

827
00:42:33,734 --> 00:42:35,528
The pair of you.

828
00:42:36,696 --> 00:42:39,240
Foaly,
I need that Time Freeze now.

829
00:42:39,407 --> 00:42:40,575
Exterior only.

830
00:42:40,741 --> 00:42:42,285
I need the inside to be alive.

831
00:42:42,451 --> 00:42:43,786
I have to talk to that kid.

832
00:42:43,953 --> 00:42:46,163
Receiver dishes
in position, check.

833
00:43:17,987 --> 00:43:19,614
Time Freeze successful!

834
00:44:13,876 --> 00:44:15,294
Top of the mornin'.

835
00:44:19,966 --> 00:44:21,217
They're coming for her.

836
00:44:21,551 --> 00:44:24,095
Artemis, do you really think
this is going to work?

837
00:44:24,178 --> 00:44:25,221
Who knows?

838
00:44:25,721 --> 00:44:27,265
I'm going to need the suit.

839
00:44:36,274 --> 00:44:37,775
Send in the advance team.

840
00:44:37,942 --> 00:44:38,943
Yes, Commander.

841
00:44:41,696 --> 00:44:43,114
Capture only.

842
00:44:43,197 --> 00:44:45,825
We need the humans unharmed.

843
00:44:45,992 --> 00:44:48,411
We scare them.
We do not kill them.

844
00:44:48,578 --> 00:44:49,787
I want them alive.

845
00:44:51,914 --> 00:44:53,207
Scared, Artemis?

846
00:44:53,374 --> 00:44:54,792
A little bit.

847
00:44:54,959 --> 00:44:57,628
But I prefer scared to dead,
if possible.

848
00:44:57,795 --> 00:44:58,963
I agree.

849
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:00,590
If possible.

850
00:45:00,756 --> 00:45:02,425
- What are they doing?
- Unarmed?

851
00:45:02,592 --> 00:45:04,051
Against all of us?

852
00:45:04,135 --> 00:45:05,136
Take the shot!

853
00:45:05,219 --> 00:45:06,262
Stop them!

854
00:45:06,345 --> 00:45:07,625
They have Officer Short's
weapon.

855
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:15,813
Behind you, Dom!

856
00:45:23,029 --> 00:45:24,197
No!

857
00:45:25,072 --> 00:45:27,116
Shoot the Time Freeze capsule!

858
00:45:27,909 --> 00:45:29,202
Take the shot!

859
00:45:39,754 --> 00:45:41,380
He's
destabilized the Time Freeze.

860
00:45:41,547 --> 00:45:43,049
How long do we have?

861
00:45:43,216 --> 00:45:45,259
I can try to patch it,
but it's not going to hold!

862
00:45:45,426 --> 00:45:47,470
This is serious.
Whatever you're going to do,

863
00:45:47,553 --> 00:45:48,763
you need to do it fast.

864
00:45:52,266 --> 00:45:53,768
Send in someone to negotiate.

865
00:45:53,935 --> 00:45:55,937
You have five minutes.

866
00:45:56,103 --> 00:45:57,104
No.

867
00:46:00,483 --> 00:46:04,111
Well, it appears
your clever little son

868
00:46:04,195 --> 00:46:06,197
has kidnapped a fairy.

869
00:46:06,364 --> 00:46:09,200
He has your flair
for the dramatic.

870
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:11,285
Why are you doing this?

871
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:14,705
Why?
It's very simple.

872
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:16,207
Revenge.

873
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:20,419
Not only did your people
wage war on mine,

874
00:46:20,586 --> 00:46:23,756
considered yourself superior
in every way,

875
00:46:23,923 --> 00:46:25,883
mocked us, reviled us,

876
00:46:25,967 --> 00:46:28,261
dismissed us
as the little people,

877
00:46:28,594 --> 00:46:30,555
but as soon as we were gone,

878
00:46:30,638 --> 00:46:33,975
you reduced us further
to silly stories.

879
00:46:34,141 --> 00:46:37,687
To have people laugh at us,
or to frighten the children.

880
00:46:37,854 --> 00:46:39,313
You can't win.

881
00:46:39,397 --> 00:46:41,524
You underestimate your people
and mine.

882
00:46:42,316 --> 00:46:43,693
Fairies and humans

883
00:46:43,776 --> 00:46:45,611
are incapable of friendship.

884
00:46:45,778 --> 00:46:47,446
Incapable of coexistence.

885
00:46:48,322 --> 00:46:50,491
With the Aculos,
I will rise to the surface

886
00:46:50,658 --> 00:46:52,493
then release my army
to take over the Earth

887
00:46:52,577 --> 00:46:54,287
and own both worlds

888
00:46:54,453 --> 00:46:57,540
and systematically wipe out
all of mankind.

889
00:46:57,707 --> 00:47:00,668
Then, I will restore fairies
to their rightful place

890
00:47:00,835 --> 00:47:03,212
as humanity crumbles beneath us.

891
00:47:03,713 --> 00:47:05,423
Some said I was mad.

892
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:07,175
They wouldn't listen to me.

893
00:47:07,341 --> 00:47:08,342
Guess what?

894
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:11,304
They're listening now.

895
00:47:17,685 --> 00:47:19,687
My name is Commander Root.

896
00:47:21,105 --> 00:47:22,523
I invite you into my house.

897
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,318
Nice try.

898
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:27,320
I'm here to negotiate.

899
00:47:28,654 --> 00:47:30,031
Who's in charge here?

900
00:47:30,156 --> 00:47:31,157
I am.

901
00:47:31,324 --> 00:47:32,867
You're only ten years old.

902
00:47:33,034 --> 00:47:35,286
Twelve. How old are you?

903
00:47:36,329 --> 00:47:37,997
If you must know,

904
00:47:38,998 --> 00:47:42,251
I'm going to be 803 in May.

905
00:47:42,418 --> 00:47:43,669
What's your name?

906
00:47:43,836 --> 00:47:44,962
Artemis Fowl.

907
00:47:49,842 --> 00:47:51,677
So, that explains it.

908
00:47:51,844 --> 00:47:54,931
You Fowls have been giving us
trouble for centuries.

909
00:47:55,097 --> 00:47:57,767
Where's your thieving father
these days?

910
00:47:57,934 --> 00:48:00,019
I wouldn't worry about that.

911
00:48:00,353 --> 00:48:02,813
Now, listen carefully,
Artemis Fowl.

912
00:48:03,606 --> 00:48:07,652
Unless you release
Officer Short immediately,

913
00:48:07,735 --> 00:48:09,487
I'll destroy this house
and everyone in it.

914
00:48:10,071 --> 00:48:12,865
And I will expose
your existence to the world.

915
00:48:13,032 --> 00:48:15,284
You can't.
You're in a Time Freeze.

916
00:48:15,451 --> 00:48:16,953
You can't get out.

917
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:19,080
But only for another 27 minutes.

918
00:48:19,247 --> 00:48:21,207
Commander, here are my terms.

919
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:25,628
Bring me the Aculos,
and Officer Short goes free.

920
00:48:25,795 --> 00:48:27,046
I beg your pardon?

921
00:48:27,213 --> 00:48:28,631
You heard me. The Aculos.

922
00:48:28,798 --> 00:48:30,383
In one of those pots.

923
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:32,301
From under a rainbow, I presume.

924
00:48:32,969 --> 00:48:37,139
I warn you,
we do not pay ransoms.

925
00:48:37,306 --> 00:48:39,559
We never have,
and we never will.

926
00:48:39,725 --> 00:48:41,644
You might just want
to reconsider that.

927
00:48:42,061 --> 00:48:44,188
I'll give you 15 minutes.

928
00:48:44,605 --> 00:48:46,899
And in case you're thinking
of storming the house,

929
00:48:47,066 --> 00:48:50,069
no fairies are allowed
to enter it while I'm alive.

930
00:48:50,862 --> 00:48:54,866
As you say.
While you're alive.

931
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,204
Who is this child?

932
00:49:00,371 --> 00:49:02,290
I think he said
he was Artemis Fowl, Jr.

933
00:49:02,456 --> 00:49:03,541
Shut up, Foaly.

934
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:06,085
Can't anyone ask a rhetorical
question around here?

935
00:49:06,252 --> 00:49:08,355
But he's going to find out
we don't even have the Aculos

936
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:10,299
and we can't storm the house.
That's fairy rules.

937
00:49:10,339 --> 00:49:12,633
He never said anything
about dwarves.

938
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,178
Remember what I said about
not underestimating the kid?

939
00:49:15,344 --> 00:49:17,305
Well, here's exactly why.

940
00:49:17,471 --> 00:49:19,891
The next piece of his plan
was set in motion.

941
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:21,934
Knowing the fairies
couldn't enter Fowl Manor,

942
00:49:22,101 --> 00:49:24,520
he forced their hand and set
the stage for the entrance

943
00:49:24,687 --> 00:49:27,273
of the true hero of our tale.

944
00:49:27,773 --> 00:49:30,651
Well, if you ask me, that is.

945
00:49:32,695 --> 00:49:34,447
Get me Mulch Diggums.

946
00:49:37,116 --> 00:49:40,077
The kid's plan
was fiendishly clever.

947
00:49:40,536 --> 00:49:41,954
He just had to get me
in the house

948
00:49:42,038 --> 00:49:44,290
because he knew the truth
about dwarves.

949
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,793
We can't resist treasure,

950
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,421
which is what brought me back
to this cozy little jail cell.

951
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:52,798
See, this was my third time
in Howler's Peak,

952
00:49:52,882 --> 00:49:55,092
the worst prison in Haven City.

953
00:49:55,259 --> 00:49:58,095
My first time in,
I did 164 years.

954
00:49:58,262 --> 00:50:00,556
But this time,
I came with music,

955
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,725
courtesy of Officer Holly Short.

956
00:50:23,955 --> 00:50:26,040
1984, Foreigner!

957
00:50:26,207 --> 00:50:27,959
It's a real classic.

958
00:50:28,751 --> 00:50:30,753
You know,
if you like human music.

959
00:50:31,546 --> 00:50:33,631
You seem like
more of a glam kind of guy.

960
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:35,591
What are you looking at, dwarf?

961
00:50:35,758 --> 00:50:37,260
Your eyes.

962
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:42,849
Just wondering
what thoughts lie behind

963
00:50:43,432 --> 00:50:45,017
those two impenetrable windows.

964
00:50:48,688 --> 00:50:50,940
So, you like eating dirt.

965
00:50:51,482 --> 00:50:56,070
Well, I don't know
if "like" is the right term.

966
00:50:56,237 --> 00:50:57,905
Tunneling is kinda something
I have to do.

967
00:50:57,989 --> 00:51:00,283
It's an occupational hazard.

968
00:51:00,449 --> 00:51:03,578
Just don't stand behind you
while you're doing it, right?

969
00:51:11,419 --> 00:51:13,671
So, this just got awkward.

970
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:15,923
Are you laughin' at me, dwarf?

971
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:17,175
At you? No.

972
00:51:17,341 --> 00:51:18,968
I was just following
their social cues.

973
00:51:19,135 --> 00:51:20,219
Because I'm not laughing.

974
00:51:20,386 --> 00:51:21,387
Yeah, I can tell.

975
00:51:22,013 --> 00:51:23,097
Wow.

976
00:51:24,682 --> 00:51:25,850
Guards.

977
00:51:26,017 --> 00:51:27,393
They're really
understaffed here.

978
00:51:28,144 --> 00:51:29,187
Hi.

979
00:51:32,064 --> 00:51:34,025
Do you like fire, too?

980
00:51:34,192 --> 00:51:36,444
No. Not so much. That's...

981
00:51:36,903 --> 00:51:40,573
So you know,
no dwarf really likes fire.

982
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,158
Careful, careful.

983
00:51:42,325 --> 00:51:44,202
We could all go up in flames.

984
00:51:44,368 --> 00:51:45,369
Not us.

985
00:51:45,536 --> 00:51:48,372
Our skin
is completely fireproof.

986
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:50,583
That's right, isn't it?
Forgot about that.

987
00:51:51,209 --> 00:51:53,961
Your skin may be fireproof,

988
00:51:54,629 --> 00:51:56,380
but what about your brain?

989
00:52:01,552 --> 00:52:02,637
Mulch Diggums!

990
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:05,264
Commander Root wants to see you.

991
00:52:05,723 --> 00:52:07,391
Exceptional timing.

992
00:52:11,938 --> 00:52:12,939
Goodbye, gentlemen.

993
00:52:20,488 --> 00:52:22,406
So, I just spoke to your boss.

994
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:23,699
I think she got the message.

995
00:52:23,866 --> 00:52:25,785
How are you
expecting this to end?

996
00:52:25,952 --> 00:52:27,328
With me getting what I want.

997
00:52:27,495 --> 00:52:28,913
Which is what, exactly?

998
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,414
My father's safe return.

999
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:33,709
This has nothing to do
with your father.

1000
00:52:33,876 --> 00:52:35,169
Look at you with that grin.

1001
00:52:35,628 --> 00:52:37,380
Thinking you're
outsmarting everyone

1002
00:52:37,463 --> 00:52:39,799
in your little suit
and sunglasses.

1003
00:52:39,966 --> 00:52:42,093
You're enjoying all this.

1004
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:44,428
You think it's a game.

1005
00:52:44,554 --> 00:52:45,555
Game?

1006
00:52:45,638 --> 00:52:46,973
My father was kidnapped.

1007
00:52:47,139 --> 00:52:48,891
My father is dead.

1008
00:52:50,393 --> 00:52:51,769
Can I trust you?

1009
00:52:52,144 --> 00:52:53,938
You'll have to.
You have no choice.

1010
00:52:58,442 --> 00:52:59,610
How did he die?

1011
00:53:00,152 --> 00:53:01,779
It was on the Hill of Tara.

1012
00:53:02,321 --> 00:53:04,657
He was ambushed
by one of our kind

1013
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:08,995
because he'd stolen
something called the Aculos.

1014
00:53:09,871 --> 00:53:12,582
I've read in my father's
journals about the Aculos.

1015
00:53:13,875 --> 00:53:16,169
About a fairy
who swore to protect it.

1016
00:53:16,335 --> 00:53:17,753
A fairy named Beechwood.

1017
00:53:18,379 --> 00:53:20,756
Beechwood Short was my father.

1018
00:53:22,842 --> 00:53:25,761
He knew how dangerous
the Aculos can be.

1019
00:53:25,928 --> 00:53:27,972
It can open portals
between worlds.

1020
00:53:28,139 --> 00:53:30,349
A skeleton key
for the whole universe.

1021
00:53:30,516 --> 00:53:31,726
He hid it.

1022
00:53:31,893 --> 00:53:35,021
And for that, some say
that he was a criminal.

1023
00:53:35,188 --> 00:53:36,731
That's what they say
about my dad.

1024
00:53:38,941 --> 00:53:40,776
But you know it's not true.

1025
00:53:46,657 --> 00:53:49,911
That hurt!

1026
00:53:58,336 --> 00:54:00,588
Artemis, it looks like
we've got another visitor.

1027
00:54:05,051 --> 00:54:07,720
Commander, Time Freeze
integrity down to 60%.

1028
00:54:10,806 --> 00:54:11,849
Understood.

1029
00:54:12,016 --> 00:54:13,726
Hold it together, Foaly.

1030
00:54:17,563 --> 00:54:18,689
Mulch.

1031
00:54:19,857 --> 00:54:21,609
This is a one-time offer.

1032
00:54:21,776 --> 00:54:23,986
Fifty years off your sentence

1033
00:54:24,153 --> 00:54:25,988
if you'll dig your way
into Fowl Manor

1034
00:54:26,072 --> 00:54:27,615
and bring out Officer Short.

1035
00:54:27,782 --> 00:54:29,367
Commander Root,

1036
00:54:29,534 --> 00:54:30,993
do you mind if I call you...

1037
00:54:31,827 --> 00:54:33,454
I actually don't know
your first name.

1038
00:54:33,621 --> 00:54:35,289
Let me guess. Britney.

1039
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,416
I'm way off, aren't I?

1040
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:39,293
It appears to me

1041
00:54:39,377 --> 00:54:41,587
like you've got a big problem
on your hands.

1042
00:54:41,671 --> 00:54:42,713
But?

1043
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:45,633
Has anyone ever told you
you're like David Bowie

1044
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,593
if David Bowie were a fairy?

1045
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,513
So, essentially,
you're David Bowie.

1046
00:54:51,013 --> 00:54:52,241
Do you think
the humans will ever

1047
00:54:52,265 --> 00:54:53,474
find out he was one of us?

1048
00:54:53,891 --> 00:54:55,142
Anyway,

1049
00:54:55,309 --> 00:54:58,187
50 years off my sentence
just isn't gonna cut it here.

1050
00:54:58,938 --> 00:55:00,815
I know what you want.
I can't give you that.

1051
00:55:00,982 --> 00:55:02,692
Come on, Root.

1052
00:55:02,859 --> 00:55:04,193
Please.

1053
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,112
I just...
I just want to be small.

1054
00:55:06,863 --> 00:55:10,032
I just want to be normal,
like the rest of my kind.

1055
00:55:11,075 --> 00:55:12,827
To be accepted.

1056
00:55:14,161 --> 00:55:16,706
You fairies got magic
coming out of your ears.

1057
00:55:16,873 --> 00:55:18,040
What have I got?

1058
00:55:18,207 --> 00:55:20,751
Three, four feet I don't need.

1059
00:55:20,918 --> 00:55:22,604
Look, a giant dwarf is exactly
what I need right now.

1060
00:55:22,628 --> 00:55:23,754
What I need right now.

1061
00:55:23,921 --> 00:55:26,424
A big, fast, hungry tunneler

1062
00:55:26,507 --> 00:55:28,426
who'll dig their way
into that house.

1063
00:55:28,593 --> 00:55:30,011
It's your choice.

1064
00:55:30,178 --> 00:55:33,347
Either bring out Officer Short
or get back to jail.

1065
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:36,100
Listen to the two of us

1066
00:55:36,267 --> 00:55:37,351
grunting at each other

1067
00:55:37,435 --> 00:55:40,062
like a pair of hippos
with a throat infection.

1068
00:55:41,981 --> 00:55:43,357
A criminal?

1069
00:55:43,524 --> 00:55:45,401
A criminal.
That's what you think I am?

1070
00:55:46,652 --> 00:55:49,614
I am so much more
than a criminal.

1071
00:55:50,823 --> 00:55:54,994
Um, technically, most of what
I do is criminal activity,

1072
00:55:55,161 --> 00:55:57,371
but I'm also an artist.

1073
00:55:59,957 --> 00:56:01,792
You're picking my pocket.

1074
00:56:03,336 --> 00:56:04,879
Okay. A hundred years
off my sentence

1075
00:56:04,962 --> 00:56:06,282
and a single cell
with no goblins.

1076
00:56:06,464 --> 00:56:07,965
Single cell and 55 years.

1077
00:56:08,132 --> 00:56:09,133
- Seventy-five.
- Sixty.

1078
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,052
- Seventy-four.
- Done. Officers!

1079
00:56:11,469 --> 00:56:13,638
You reading me, Mulch?

1080
00:56:13,804 --> 00:56:15,806
Loud and clear, horsey.

1081
00:56:17,016 --> 00:56:19,769
Dwarfus Giaganticus.

1082
00:56:21,103 --> 00:56:23,439
Dwarfus Giaganticus.

1083
00:56:26,192 --> 00:56:27,193
Everybody,

1084
00:56:27,485 --> 00:56:28,903
stand back.

1085
00:56:33,491 --> 00:56:35,284
It's feeding time.

1086
00:57:00,476 --> 00:57:01,602
I'm in.

1087
00:57:04,313 --> 00:57:06,107
I know that sound.

1088
00:57:06,274 --> 00:57:07,775
Mulch Diggums.

1089
00:57:12,238 --> 00:57:13,239
Mulch,

1090
00:57:13,322 --> 00:57:14,949
I'm switching
your iris-cam to X-ray.

1091
00:57:15,116 --> 00:57:16,868
That's good.
You do you, Foaly.

1092
00:57:17,034 --> 00:57:19,203
You might feel a slight pinch.

1093
00:57:19,662 --> 00:57:22,164
- You son of a...
- Sorry!

1094
00:57:22,331 --> 00:57:24,292
What would your parents be?

1095
00:57:24,959 --> 00:57:26,794
We have a visitor.

1096
00:57:27,211 --> 00:57:28,421
What is it?

1097
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:31,924
It's in the portrait gallery.

1098
00:57:32,967 --> 00:57:35,052
It's like a really, really

1099
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:36,637
big dwarf.

1100
00:57:40,433 --> 00:57:41,434
Yes.

1101
00:57:41,601 --> 00:57:42,977
Right on schedule.

1102
00:57:43,394 --> 00:57:45,479
Well, if I was
gonna be manipulated,

1103
00:57:45,563 --> 00:57:47,148
might as well be by the best.

1104
00:57:47,315 --> 00:57:50,902
And make no mistake,
the kid is the best.

1105
00:57:51,068 --> 00:57:54,363
House marks the spot.

1106
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,368
What have we here?

1107
00:58:11,631 --> 00:58:14,175
The TXTL 5000.

1108
00:58:14,342 --> 00:58:15,885
He's discovered a safe.

1109
00:58:16,052 --> 00:58:17,220
Let him open it.

1110
00:58:17,386 --> 00:58:18,888
That's exactly what I want.

1111
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:27,396
We meet again.

1112
00:58:30,107 --> 00:58:31,943
So, they've sent in a dwarf.

1113
00:58:32,109 --> 00:58:33,694
Look, I need your help.

1114
00:58:35,571 --> 00:58:37,532
Listen, if I let you out,

1115
00:58:37,698 --> 00:58:39,618
will you promise not to
take command of my brain?

1116
00:58:39,784 --> 00:58:42,036
I want nothing to do
with that brain.

1117
00:58:54,549 --> 00:58:55,550
And...

1118
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,141
Bingo!

1119
00:59:05,518 --> 00:59:06,811
Temperamental.

1120
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,230
You've evolved.

1121
00:59:10,314 --> 00:59:11,732
But so have I.

1122
00:59:14,151 --> 00:59:16,404
Sounds like you're not
the only one opening locks.

1123
00:59:16,988 --> 00:59:18,447
By the way, if you run,

1124
00:59:18,531 --> 00:59:20,908
I will expose your existence
to the world.

1125
00:59:23,035 --> 00:59:24,537
You are my guest.

1126
00:59:25,162 --> 00:59:28,040
I invited you in.
The rules are clear.

1127
00:59:28,624 --> 00:59:31,878
They are, but you think
you can trust me?

1128
00:59:35,923 --> 00:59:36,966
Now you can trust me.

1129
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:38,968
Fair enough.

1130
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,636
Let's find that dwarf.

1131
00:59:41,554 --> 00:59:44,265
Eight new
motion-sensitive tumblers.

1132
00:59:44,432 --> 00:59:46,100
You devil.

1133
00:59:50,521 --> 00:59:51,772
It can't be.

1134
00:59:52,648 --> 00:59:54,233
Holy moly!

1135
01:00:03,659 --> 01:00:05,286
Step back, Mr. Diggums.

1136
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:08,414
It's real.
It's perfect.

1137
01:00:08,581 --> 01:00:09,582
The Aculos.

1138
01:00:10,082 --> 01:00:13,169
The most powerful treasure
in the fairy world.

1139
01:00:21,886 --> 01:00:23,054
Don't.

1140
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:26,224
It will kill you if you use it.

1141
01:00:27,016 --> 01:00:28,559
If any human does.

1142
01:00:29,977 --> 01:00:31,938
I don't need to use it.

1143
01:00:32,104 --> 01:00:34,504
Because my bargaining position
just got a whole lot stronger.

1144
01:00:34,649 --> 01:00:37,235
The fairies outside mustn't
get to hear that we have this.

1145
01:00:37,735 --> 01:00:39,529
I'm sorry, human,

1146
01:00:40,321 --> 01:00:42,156
but they already know.

1147
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,585
There's been a development?

1148
01:00:54,752 --> 01:00:56,170
They found the Aculos.

1149
01:00:56,337 --> 01:00:57,839
As I expected.

1150
01:00:58,005 --> 01:00:59,298
In Fowl Manor.

1151
01:00:59,465 --> 01:01:00,925
You know what to do.

1152
01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:02,051
It's risky.

1153
01:01:02,218 --> 01:01:04,262
Root has our entire army
at her disposal.

1154
01:01:04,428 --> 01:01:06,639
It's quite simple, Cudgeon.

1155
01:01:07,056 --> 01:01:09,141
If you wish to survive

1156
01:01:09,225 --> 01:01:11,811
and thrive
in my brave new world,

1157
01:01:11,978 --> 01:01:14,230
then you will intervene now.

1158
01:01:18,693 --> 01:01:20,069
Commander!

1159
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,281
This Time Freeze
is seriously unstable.

1160
01:01:23,739 --> 01:01:25,241
This may not hold.

1161
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,704
We've lost one!

1162
01:01:37,628 --> 01:01:39,881
Commander Root,

1163
01:01:40,047 --> 01:01:41,984
you are hereby officially
relieved of your command

1164
01:01:42,008 --> 01:01:43,634
on authorization
of the executors.

1165
01:01:43,801 --> 01:01:45,928
You're making a mistake,
Cudgeon.

1166
01:01:46,095 --> 01:01:48,973
My only mistake was not
doing this a long time ago.

1167
01:01:49,348 --> 01:01:52,727
With the Aculos in play,
the game has changed.

1168
01:01:53,394 --> 01:01:55,354
Time for a little direct action,

1169
01:01:55,438 --> 01:01:56,689
don't you think?

1170
01:01:56,856 --> 01:01:58,482
Let me show you how it's done.

1171
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:00,358
Knock it off!

1172
01:02:01,235 --> 01:02:02,320
Mistake.

1173
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:05,198
I mean, really, big mistake.

1174
01:02:09,577 --> 01:02:11,245
This should wrap things up.

1175
01:02:12,163 --> 01:02:14,373
Recognize our new recruit?

1176
01:02:15,041 --> 01:02:19,337
We fed it a little potion
of nettles and wasp juice.

1177
01:02:19,504 --> 01:02:21,881
Everything trolls
are allergic to.

1178
01:02:22,048 --> 01:02:26,844
It's made it twice as strong
and 10 times as mad.

1179
01:02:34,435 --> 01:02:35,436
D'arvit!

1180
01:02:45,404 --> 01:02:47,114
That can't be good.

1181
01:02:51,661 --> 01:02:52,662
Go!

1182
01:02:52,745 --> 01:02:53,829
Come on, let's go!

1183
01:02:53,996 --> 01:02:55,039
Come on!

1184
01:02:59,919 --> 01:03:01,003
Gods alive.

1185
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:02,171
What is that?

1186
01:03:02,296 --> 01:03:05,925
A creature that consumes
humans in 2.97 seconds

1187
01:03:06,092 --> 01:03:08,052
and fairies in less than one.

1188
01:03:08,219 --> 01:03:09,428
Get ready.

1189
01:03:09,595 --> 01:03:11,264
This is going all the way.

1190
01:03:15,017 --> 01:03:16,477
I'll need my gun.

1191
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,954
Jam all magic in the house.

1192
01:03:35,371 --> 01:03:37,211
But Officer Short,
she'll need hers to survive.

1193
01:03:37,373 --> 01:03:39,041
Her father used his magic
against us.

1194
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:41,711
I'm not making the same
mistake twice. Do as I say.

1195
01:03:45,965 --> 01:03:47,383
I didn't read much on trolls.

1196
01:03:47,466 --> 01:03:48,718
Anything I should look out for?

1197
01:03:48,801 --> 01:03:49,802
The teeth.

1198
01:03:51,846 --> 01:03:53,556
Good to know.

1199
01:03:59,645 --> 01:04:02,023
All magic
in the house is now jammed.

1200
01:04:05,401 --> 01:04:06,652
Everything okay?

1201
01:04:08,946 --> 01:04:09,989
Sure.

1202
01:04:21,792 --> 01:04:23,628
Help! I'm stuck!
Get me out!

1203
01:04:27,673 --> 01:04:29,091
I'll distract him!

1204
01:04:38,226 --> 01:04:39,602
Help! I'm stuck!

1205
01:04:40,269 --> 01:04:42,230
Mulch, help.

1206
01:04:45,566 --> 01:04:46,651
Juliet, look out!

1207
01:04:48,694 --> 01:04:51,155
It's okay, I've got this!
Juliet, run!

1208
01:04:51,322 --> 01:04:52,657
Run, Juliet! Run!

1209
01:04:52,823 --> 01:04:54,534
Come and get some,
you big meanie!

1210
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:00,581
Help!

1211
01:05:00,665 --> 01:05:01,707
Quick! Quick!

1212
01:05:01,791 --> 01:05:02,834
I'm reaching!

1213
01:05:02,917 --> 01:05:03,960
Gotcha!

1214
01:05:14,262 --> 01:05:15,471
Artemis!

1215
01:05:18,266 --> 01:05:20,101
No! No!

1216
01:05:28,901 --> 01:05:29,902
Mulch!

1217
01:05:29,986 --> 01:05:31,612
I could use a little help!

1218
01:05:37,201 --> 01:05:38,786
Good.

1219
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,162
Hi!

1220
01:05:41,205 --> 01:05:42,206
Okay.

1221
01:05:42,373 --> 01:05:44,458
Let me just put this away.

1222
01:05:48,462 --> 01:05:50,173
Artemis, run!

1223
01:05:50,339 --> 01:05:51,619
I'll see you guys
on the balcony!

1224
01:05:54,135 --> 01:05:56,012
Juliet! Jump!

1225
01:05:56,095 --> 01:05:58,598
Holly!

1226
01:06:10,276 --> 01:06:11,277
Dom!

1227
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:12,403
Holly!

1228
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:13,779
Holly! Holly!

1229
01:06:18,618 --> 01:06:20,328
Dom!

1230
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:25,791
Let go!

1231
01:06:32,882 --> 01:06:35,051
D'arvit!

1232
01:06:41,349 --> 01:06:42,725
Artemis! Jump!

1233
01:06:50,441 --> 01:06:51,484
Help!

1234
01:06:51,567 --> 01:06:53,653
I'm trying!
I'm trying!

1235
01:06:57,573 --> 01:06:59,116
Juliet, run!

1236
01:07:13,047 --> 01:07:14,048
Dom!

1237
01:07:16,008 --> 01:07:17,176
Pull!

1238
01:07:42,285 --> 01:07:44,036
Holly, look out!

1239
01:07:48,207 --> 01:07:49,625
I'll get the gun!

1240
01:07:57,133 --> 01:07:58,634
Artemis!

1241
01:08:07,810 --> 01:08:09,854
Dom! No!

1242
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:14,901
My.

1243
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:18,821
Go!

1244
01:08:18,988 --> 01:08:20,823
Get help!
Try the phones again!

1245
01:08:20,907 --> 01:08:21,908
Now!

1246
01:08:23,910 --> 01:08:25,703
Domovoi? Dom?

1247
01:08:35,379 --> 01:08:36,797
The Time Freeze is collapsing.

1248
01:08:36,964 --> 01:08:38,466
I can't hold it any longer.

1249
01:08:38,633 --> 01:08:40,092
There goes another fairy!

1250
01:08:55,608 --> 01:08:56,609
Help him!

1251
01:08:56,776 --> 01:08:58,694
I can't.
They've blocked my magic.

1252
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:00,404
Artemis,

1253
01:09:01,155 --> 01:09:03,616
there's nothing
I can do for him.

1254
01:09:05,743 --> 01:09:06,911
Hold on, buddy.

1255
01:09:07,078 --> 01:09:08,412
In kendo,

1256
01:09:09,205 --> 01:09:11,624
we call it kiri oroshi.

1257
01:09:12,667 --> 01:09:14,544
- "The fatal blow."
- No.

1258
01:09:15,795 --> 01:09:17,505
You did great back there.

1259
01:09:17,964 --> 01:09:20,550
Really. All the Butlers
will be proud of you.

1260
01:09:22,009 --> 01:09:23,636
Goodbye, my friend.

1261
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:45,283
May the road rise up
to meet you.

1262
01:09:46,409 --> 01:09:48,661
May the wind
be always at your back.

1263
01:09:49,412 --> 01:09:52,415
May the sun shine
warm upon your face.

1264
01:09:55,543 --> 01:09:58,713
May the rains fall soft
upon your fields.

1265
01:09:59,297 --> 01:10:01,424
And until we meet again,

1266
01:10:01,591 --> 01:10:04,260
may a friend be always near.

1267
01:10:07,722 --> 01:10:09,322
No sign of
further activity in the house.

1268
01:10:09,348 --> 01:10:10,868
Five more minutes,
then we're going in.

1269
01:10:10,892 --> 01:10:12,018
Request permission to

1270
01:10:12,101 --> 01:10:13,328
restore
Officer Short's magic, sir.

1271
01:10:13,352 --> 01:10:14,478
Permission denied.

1272
01:10:14,645 --> 01:10:15,938
It could save her life!

1273
01:10:16,105 --> 01:10:17,899
She's a traitor,
just like her father.

1274
01:10:18,065 --> 01:10:19,233
No, she's one of us!

1275
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:20,401
Commander Root.

1276
01:10:21,277 --> 01:10:23,571
I didn't make you captain
for nothing.

1277
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:27,533
Don't you dare!

1278
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:28,910
Squad!

1279
01:10:29,076 --> 01:10:31,162
Unblock magic!

1280
01:10:38,211 --> 01:10:39,378
Come on!

1281
01:10:39,545 --> 01:10:41,422
Artemis, look out!

1282
01:10:43,591 --> 01:10:44,800
Come on.

1283
01:10:45,801 --> 01:10:47,553
Come on, Domovoi!

1284
01:10:48,888 --> 01:10:50,056
You're back!

1285
01:10:51,098 --> 01:10:52,892
Holly brought you back!

1286
01:10:59,732 --> 01:11:01,567
I didn't cry, did I?

1287
01:11:04,195 --> 01:11:05,738
Little bit.

1288
01:11:11,118 --> 01:11:13,454
The Time Freeze is
gonna collapse any second now.

1289
01:11:13,621 --> 01:11:15,873
All L.E.P. personnel,
evacuate.

1290
01:11:19,585 --> 01:11:20,586
Mulch!

1291
01:11:20,753 --> 01:11:22,713
The Aculos.
Do you still have it?

1292
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,090
Yeah, sure.

1293
01:11:24,257 --> 01:11:25,341
Right there.

1294
01:11:29,011 --> 01:11:30,012
Good.

1295
01:11:30,471 --> 01:11:32,139
I have a plan.

1296
01:11:38,521 --> 01:11:39,522
That's it.

1297
01:11:39,689 --> 01:11:41,190
Temporal convergence
at maximum force.

1298
01:11:41,357 --> 01:11:43,150
Time bend start now.

1299
01:11:43,317 --> 01:11:44,443
Distortion, elastication,

1300
01:11:44,527 --> 01:11:46,237
and space grabs coming your way.

1301
01:11:46,404 --> 01:11:47,530
For your own sakes,

1302
01:11:47,613 --> 01:11:49,323
get out of there now
and get home safe.

1303
01:11:49,490 --> 01:11:51,784
This Time Freeze is gonna blow!

1304
01:12:06,883 --> 01:12:07,967
Officer Short!

1305
01:12:08,134 --> 01:12:09,760
Get out of there now.

1306
01:12:09,927 --> 01:12:12,555
Leave the humans.
Save yourself!

1307
01:12:21,731 --> 01:12:23,566
Artemis, what's happening?

1308
01:12:23,858 --> 01:12:25,109
Take cover!

1309
01:12:41,918 --> 01:12:42,919
Whoa!

1310
01:12:43,252 --> 01:12:44,253
Watch out!

1311
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:45,900
Come on,
we've got to get out of here!

1312
01:12:46,923 --> 01:12:47,924
We gotta get out...

1313
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:49,759
See you on the other side!

1314
01:12:49,926 --> 01:12:51,219
Mulch, get out of here!

1315
01:12:55,556 --> 01:12:56,599
Everybody!

1316
01:12:56,766 --> 01:12:58,309
Take cover!

1317
01:12:58,392 --> 01:13:00,061
Whoa!

1318
01:13:06,734 --> 01:13:08,528
Holly, this is your last chance.

1319
01:13:08,694 --> 01:13:09,862
You can't save him.

1320
01:13:10,029 --> 01:13:11,864
Just get out of there now.

1321
01:13:38,891 --> 01:13:41,227
And now,
the final piece of the plan.

1322
01:13:41,686 --> 01:13:43,121
The Time Freeze is ended.
They're gone.

1323
01:13:43,145 --> 01:13:44,146
Did we win?

1324
01:13:44,230 --> 01:13:45,565
Not yet. I can't give this

1325
01:13:45,648 --> 01:13:46,983
to Opal Koboi.
It's too powerful.

1326
01:13:47,066 --> 01:13:48,168
Then what are you waiting for?

1327
01:13:48,192 --> 01:13:49,672
Use its magic
to get your father back.

1328
01:13:49,735 --> 01:13:51,404
- I can't. Not yet.
- I don't understand.

1329
01:13:51,571 --> 01:13:53,447
This holds a power
no human can access.

1330
01:13:53,614 --> 01:13:54,675
It's their source of magic,

1331
01:13:54,699 --> 01:13:56,299
as important to them
as the sun is to us.

1332
01:13:56,409 --> 01:13:57,410
You have to try.

1333
01:13:57,577 --> 01:13:58,817
I thought I could, but I can't.

1334
01:13:58,911 --> 01:14:00,830
Holly said if any human
uses it, they'll die.

1335
01:14:00,997 --> 01:14:02,331
We're running out of time.

1336
01:14:02,498 --> 01:14:04,250
Artemis, it's too dangerous.

1337
01:14:04,417 --> 01:14:06,294
Exactly.
It's useless in my hands.

1338
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:07,795
But not in mine.

1339
01:14:08,004 --> 01:14:09,172
You're late.

1340
01:14:09,338 --> 01:14:12,300
You know I'm breaking
every rule in the book.

1341
01:14:13,176 --> 01:14:14,594
You like to break rules.

1342
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:16,053
You can talk.

1343
01:14:17,346 --> 01:14:18,681
Let's make a trade.

1344
01:14:18,848 --> 01:14:20,349
The Aculos for my father.

1345
01:14:22,101 --> 01:14:24,145
How do I know I can trust you?

1346
01:14:24,937 --> 01:14:26,981
My father used to say,

1347
01:14:27,064 --> 01:14:29,400
"A friend's eye
is a good mirror."

1348
01:14:30,443 --> 01:14:31,986
Are we friends,

1349
01:14:32,445 --> 01:14:33,905
Artemis Fowl?

1350
01:14:35,865 --> 01:14:37,241
We are.

1351
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:42,705
Forever friends.

1352
01:14:45,666 --> 01:14:47,251
We need to hurry.

1353
01:14:57,970 --> 01:14:59,931
Your time is up.

1354
01:15:00,306 --> 01:15:03,267
The young genius Artemis Fowl

1355
01:15:03,434 --> 01:15:06,270
has failed his beloved father.

1356
01:15:07,230 --> 01:15:10,316
Say hello to Beechwood for me.

1357
01:15:16,364 --> 01:15:18,157
I don't even know
that this will work.

1358
01:15:19,492 --> 01:15:21,077
You have to try.

1359
01:15:24,205 --> 01:15:25,581
Carry me always.

1360
01:15:27,124 --> 01:15:29,293
Carry me well.

1361
01:15:29,377 --> 01:15:33,548
I am thy teacher
of herb and spell.

1362
01:15:34,423 --> 01:15:38,135
I am thy link to power arcane.

1363
01:15:39,387 --> 01:15:43,724
Forget me,
and thy magic shall wane.

1364
01:15:55,611 --> 01:15:57,363
Die, Fowl!

1365
01:15:59,907 --> 01:16:01,993
To power arcane.

1366
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:06,539
Forget me,
and thy magic shall wane.

1367
01:16:06,706 --> 01:16:09,584
Carry me well. Carry me well.

1368
01:16:12,128 --> 01:16:13,921
Forget me, magic shall wane.

1369
01:16:20,553 --> 01:16:21,679
Carry me well.

1370
01:16:43,326 --> 01:16:44,785
Did it work?

1371
01:16:45,244 --> 01:16:46,412
Did you bring him back?

1372
01:16:47,538 --> 01:16:48,706
I don't know.

1373
01:16:59,509 --> 01:17:01,636
He can't be. Please.

1374
01:17:05,932 --> 01:17:07,558
Dad!

1375
01:17:11,604 --> 01:17:13,272
Dad!

1376
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:33,334
Artemis...

1377
01:17:34,669 --> 01:17:36,671
I'm so sorry.

1378
01:17:37,255 --> 01:17:38,381
It's over.

1379
01:17:39,048 --> 01:17:40,550
I've lost him, haven't I?

1380
01:17:42,426 --> 01:17:43,719
Artemis!

1381
01:17:44,637 --> 01:17:45,805
Did you hear that?

1382
01:17:47,932 --> 01:17:49,767
Dad! Dad!

1383
01:17:52,895 --> 01:17:53,980
Dad!

1384
01:17:55,189 --> 01:17:56,357
Dad!

1385
01:17:59,068 --> 01:18:00,152
Dad!

1386
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:02,446
Artemis.

1387
01:18:09,829 --> 01:18:11,038
No!

1388
01:18:17,753 --> 01:18:18,838
How?

1389
01:18:19,005 --> 01:18:20,506
How did you save me, son?

1390
01:18:20,673 --> 01:18:22,675
I just followed the story.

1391
01:18:24,051 --> 01:18:25,720
With a little help
from a friend.

1392
01:18:27,096 --> 01:18:28,514
Dad,

1393
01:18:28,681 --> 01:18:30,600
meet Officer Holly Short,

1394
01:18:30,766 --> 01:18:32,894
daughter of Beechwood Short.

1395
01:18:37,481 --> 01:18:41,235
Your father was a great man
and a dear friend.

1396
01:18:43,613 --> 01:18:44,989
He brought me the Aculos

1397
01:18:45,072 --> 01:18:46,991
because there are forces
in your world

1398
01:18:47,575 --> 01:18:49,619
who wanted its power
for themselves.

1399
01:18:50,328 --> 01:18:52,705
So, he was trying to protect it?

1400
01:18:52,872 --> 01:18:53,998
Yes.

1401
01:18:54,165 --> 01:18:56,292
Yes, yes. He was.

1402
01:18:56,459 --> 01:18:58,085
And he did.

1403
01:18:58,252 --> 01:18:59,545
With his life.

1404
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:02,924
Your father was a hero, Holly.

1405
01:19:04,133 --> 01:19:05,384
Just like you.

1406
01:19:06,802 --> 01:19:09,722
He, gave me this list.

1407
01:19:10,556 --> 01:19:13,184
It's a list of names
that I can't even pronounce.

1408
01:19:13,351 --> 01:19:14,560
These are Opal's accomplices.

1409
01:19:14,644 --> 01:19:16,562
We were looking for them
when I was captured.

1410
01:19:16,729 --> 01:19:18,648
They're the ones
you'll want to investigate.

1411
01:19:20,024 --> 01:19:21,651
I'm sorry for your loss.

1412
01:19:22,109 --> 01:19:23,110
Thank you very much.

1413
01:19:26,531 --> 01:19:28,824
- It's so good to see you.
- I am not going to cry.

1414
01:19:29,033 --> 01:19:30,576
I'm not going to cry.

1415
01:20:12,910 --> 01:20:14,954
The Aculos is safe at last,

1416
01:20:15,037 --> 01:20:16,497
now that we know our enemies,

1417
01:20:16,664 --> 01:20:18,207
thanks to you, Holly.

1418
01:20:24,172 --> 01:20:25,840
Quite the day.

1419
01:20:26,007 --> 01:20:27,383
Yes, Commander.

1420
01:20:31,470 --> 01:20:34,223
Curb that maverick streak in you

1421
01:20:34,849 --> 01:20:37,185
and you'll make
a decent officer someday.

1422
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:39,395
Thank you, Commander.

1423
01:20:51,699 --> 01:20:54,785
This place needs
fairies like you.

1424
01:20:58,289 --> 01:21:03,503
Our world has never been
so much in danger.

1425
01:21:06,464 --> 01:21:08,341
It's not perfect, Holly.

1426
01:21:09,091 --> 01:21:11,928
But it's ours,
it's a light to guide us,

1427
01:21:12,011 --> 01:21:14,347
and it's worth fighting for.

1428
01:21:15,431 --> 01:21:17,475
I want you to investigate

1429
01:21:17,558 --> 01:21:20,144
every name
on your father's list.

1430
01:21:21,145 --> 01:21:22,188
Me?

1431
01:21:23,648 --> 01:21:25,274
Well, who else am I talking to?

1432
01:21:25,441 --> 01:21:26,943
Nobody else, Commander, just me.

1433
01:21:27,735 --> 01:21:29,862
- Go on.
- I'm going to...

1434
01:21:30,446 --> 01:21:32,323
You won't regret...
I will not...

1435
01:21:32,490 --> 01:21:33,699
- Go on.
- I'll just go.

1436
01:21:55,263 --> 01:21:56,722
Here we go, Dad.

1437
01:22:07,775 --> 01:22:10,361
- Nice work, Holly!
- Well done, Holly!

1438
01:22:18,744 --> 01:22:20,037
All right, team,

1439
01:22:20,204 --> 01:22:21,789
here we go.

1440
01:23:01,412 --> 01:23:03,748
This is a community
still coming to terms

1441
01:23:03,831 --> 01:23:05,791
with these stunning revelations.

1442
01:23:05,958 --> 01:23:07,460
The family has lived
in the house

1443
01:23:07,543 --> 01:23:10,213
for generations
and is well-known locally,

1444
01:23:10,379 --> 01:23:13,549
but there's a sense of real
shock here that Artemis Fowl,

1445
01:23:13,716 --> 01:23:16,385
who neighbors describe
as quiet and...

1446
01:23:17,345 --> 01:23:18,638
It would appear we've garnered

1447
01:23:18,721 --> 01:23:19,931
quite a bit of interest.

1448
01:23:20,014 --> 01:23:21,015
Not ideal.

1449
01:23:21,182 --> 01:23:22,266
The media?

1450
01:23:22,433 --> 01:23:24,435
I have someone
working on that right now.

1451
01:23:24,602 --> 01:23:26,312
I expected you would.

1452
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:28,898
These are for you, son.

1453
01:23:29,273 --> 01:23:30,399
Just don't forget to wash it

1454
01:23:30,483 --> 01:23:32,026
before you bring it back, okay?

1455
01:23:33,069 --> 01:23:34,362
Where are we going?

1456
01:23:34,529 --> 01:23:35,696
To finish this.

1457
01:23:36,113 --> 01:23:37,406
You think I'm ready?

1458
01:23:37,573 --> 01:23:39,116
I know you're ready.

1459
01:23:40,117 --> 01:23:41,994
First, I have a call to make.

1460
01:24:01,138 --> 01:24:02,515
You failed, Opal.

1461
01:24:02,974 --> 01:24:04,851
You were wrong about my father.

1462
01:24:05,309 --> 01:24:08,437
About Beechwood.
About everything.

1463
01:24:09,063 --> 01:24:10,481
And now...

1464
01:24:11,357 --> 01:24:13,192
we're coming for you.

1465
01:24:13,359 --> 01:24:17,113
You think you can beat me?

1466
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,490
You have no idea the world

1467
01:24:19,574 --> 01:24:22,368
that you have just entered, boy.

1468
01:24:22,535 --> 01:24:25,329
Just who do you think you are?

1469
01:24:25,496 --> 01:24:27,331
I'm Artemis Fowl...

1470
01:24:28,833 --> 01:24:31,460
and I'm a criminal mastermind.

1471
01:25:06,954 --> 01:25:08,331
What an extraordinary ending

1472
01:25:08,414 --> 01:25:10,082
to your remarkable fairy tale.

1473
01:25:10,249 --> 01:25:11,351
But let's get back
to the thief, shall we?

1474
01:25:11,375 --> 01:25:12,561
He will be brought to justice,

1475
01:25:12,585 --> 01:25:14,545
and you will not leave here
until you assist us.

1476
01:25:15,213 --> 01:25:16,964
You really don't believe
any of it?

1477
01:25:17,048 --> 01:25:18,317
The only thing
in that fanciful tale

1478
01:25:18,341 --> 01:25:19,967
I did believe
is that you can be bought.

1479
01:25:20,134 --> 01:25:21,195
So, let us offer you a deal.

1480
01:25:21,219 --> 01:25:22,762
Help us apprehend
Artemis Fowl, Sr.,

1481
01:25:22,929 --> 01:25:24,597
and then you'll walk.

1482
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:26,057
Tsk.

1483
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:29,268
Or perhaps I offer you a deal?

1484
01:25:30,186 --> 01:25:32,271
I walk out on my own,

1485
01:25:32,355 --> 01:25:35,483
and you leave
the Fowls alone forever.

1486
01:25:35,816 --> 01:25:38,528
And why would we ever do that?

1487
01:25:38,694 --> 01:25:41,531
So that you can
all sleep at night,

1488
01:25:42,448 --> 01:25:45,868
knowing that the fairy tales
you tell your kids

1489
01:25:46,035 --> 01:25:48,454
remain beautiful dreams,

1490
01:25:48,955 --> 01:25:54,126
and not living nightmares.

1491
01:25:56,128 --> 01:25:58,047
And the next time
you see the Fowls,

1492
01:25:58,130 --> 01:26:01,551
be sure to thank them
for protecting us all.

1493
01:26:01,717 --> 01:26:03,302
They keep the peace.

1494
01:26:03,469 --> 01:26:05,054
Don't ever forget it.

1495
01:26:06,597 --> 01:26:08,724
That's why Artemis
set up my arrest.

1496
01:26:08,808 --> 01:26:10,184
That's why I'm here.

1497
01:26:10,351 --> 01:26:13,229
He figured
you'd have to believe me.

1498
01:26:19,986 --> 01:26:21,779
Alert the guards.

1499
01:26:25,783 --> 01:26:27,869
I hope you don't get squeamish.

1500
01:26:33,583 --> 01:26:34,667
Lockdown!

1501
01:26:34,834 --> 01:26:36,377
Immediate lockdown.

1502
01:26:39,213 --> 01:26:40,882
A tracking device.

1503
01:26:42,258 --> 01:26:43,885
Designed by the kid.

1504
01:26:45,511 --> 01:26:47,972
Clap your hands
if you believe in fairies.

1505
01:26:52,185 --> 01:26:54,187
That's my ride!

1506
01:26:54,896 --> 01:26:56,022
Lockdown!

1507
01:26:56,189 --> 01:26:57,940
Get back here,
you filthy little dwarf!

1508
01:26:58,107 --> 01:27:00,902
Dwarfus Giaganticus!

1509
01:27:08,784 --> 01:27:10,870
Don't mind me, I got this.

1510
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:17,293
Are you ready
to get back to work?

1511
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:19,587
I thought you'd never ask.

1512
01:27:20,505 --> 01:27:22,924
We have
some unfinished business.

1513
01:27:23,674 --> 01:27:26,052
I love my job!

1514
01:27:45,988 --> 01:27:47,198
Okay.

1515
01:27:47,865 --> 01:27:49,158
Let's go.
