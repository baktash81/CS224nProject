1
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,524
Heads up! Good defense!

2
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,150
Good defense!

3
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,834
We're going downtown.

4
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:18,222
Shut the hell up, you stupid mutt!

5
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:19,973
What do you want?

6
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:25,145
HDS, sir. How are you this afternoon?
Alrighty. I have a package for you.

7
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,733
It sounds broken.

8
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:34,446
Most likely. I'll bet it was something
nice. This is an insurance form.

9
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,449
If you'll just sign here,
here, and here...

10
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,410
...we'll get the rest of the forms
to you soon.

11
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,208
That's a lovely dog.

12
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:50,087
-Do you mind if I pet him?
-I don't give a rat's ass.

13
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,684
Oh, brother!

14
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,936
That's fine. I can finish the rest.

15
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,773
You just have yourself a good day.
Take care now. Bye-bye.

16
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,246
Excuse me! HDS!

17
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,331
HDS! Coming through!

18
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:28,000
Got a package, people!

19
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,974
Get away from the door.

20
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,480
What's the matter with you?
I said, get!

21
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:56,653
Son of a bitch!

22
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,823
That was a close one!

23
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,200
Unfortunately...

24
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,786
...in every contest
there must be a loser.

25
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,591
Hungry, fellow?

26
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,597
There you go.

27
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,396
No problem. It gets flooded.
We'll just wait a few seconds.

28
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,650
Or we can try it now.

29
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:35,984
Putz!

30
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,277
Come on!

31
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,780
Get out! Get out!

32
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:45,577
Warning: Assholes
are closer than they appear!

33
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,417
Give me a push while you're back there.

34
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,588
Alrighty, then!

35
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,218
It's alive!

36
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,178
It's alive!

37
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:51,560
My little baby, come here.
You missed Mommy, didn't you?

38
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,231
Yes, you did. Did Daddy hurt you?
I won't let him. No, I won't.

39
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:01,570
He can keep the big TV, but he's not
gonna hurt my baby, no he's not.

40
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,284
Thank you, Mr. Ventura.

41
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,080
How can I ever repay you?

42
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:13,665
A reward would be good.

43
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:17,961
There is some damage to my car,
and I had to fill it with premium.

44
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:24,510
Would you like for me
to take your pants off instead?

45
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,555
Gee! Let me think.

46
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,140
Sure.

47
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,527
People are real friendly around here.

48
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:39,603
Ventura!

49
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:43,315
Yes, Satan?

50
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,361
I'm sorry, sir.
You sounded like someone else.

51
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:50,113
Never mind the wisecracks, Ventura.

52
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,159
You owe me rent.

53
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:57,496
Mr. Shickadance, I told you,
you're my first priority.

54
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:01,291
I'm on a very big case right now.
Check this out.

55
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,336
Look at that.
That's a true albino pigeon.

56
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,923
Some rich guy lost it.
He's offering a $25,000 reward.

57
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,133
As soon as I find this bird...

58
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:11,301
...You're paid.

59
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:14,012
I heard animals in there.

60
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:17,057
I heard them again this morning,
scratching around.

61
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:19,309
I never bring my work home with me.

62
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:20,853
Oh, yeah?

63
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,897
What's all this pet food for?

64
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:25,774
Fiber.

65
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,736
Wanna take a look inside? Come on!

66
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:31,655
Come on!

67
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,086
Go ahead. Snoop around!

68
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:00,309
Well?

69
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,311
Are you satisfied?

70
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:09,151
Just don't let me catch you
with an animal in here. That's all.

71
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:10,652
All right.

72
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:13,197
Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.

73
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:16,408
Loser!

74
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:45,395
Come to me, jungle friends.

75
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:03,455
Roger, let me ask you one question.

76
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,375
How in hell do you lose
a 500-pound fish?

77
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:08,961
What?

78
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,421
I'm sorry, I was just going to say...

79
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,466
...that it's not a fish. It's a mammal.

80
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,844
Thank you, Miss Jacques Cousteau.

81
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:18,971
She didn't mean anything by that.

82
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:22,516
I don't give a good goddamn
about that fish!

83
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,102
Fillet it and fast-food it
if you want to!

84
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:28,730
All I give a damn about is
winning the Super Bowl!

85
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:32,609
My athletes have got to have
their heads in the right place!

86
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:37,030
Shit, Roger! You've been
in this business a long time.

87
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:40,284
You know how superstitious
these players are.

88
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:44,997
I have a quarterback that's put his
socks on backwards since high school.

89
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:49,334
I've got a linebacker that hasn't washed
his jockey strap in two years...

90
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:52,296
...because he thinks flies are lucky.

91
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:56,258
I want that fish on that field
Super Bowl Sunday.

92
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,010
Find the fish...

93
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,928
...or find new jobs!

94
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:03,056
Why did it happen now,
two weeks before the Super Bowl?

95
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:06,226
I'll tell you, it's those
animal-rights activists!

96
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:08,187
Always out with their signs:

97
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:11,356
"Animals were born free!
Stop torturing Snowflake!"

98
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,650
That fish lives better than they do.

99
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:18,530
The police are checking into the animal-
rights groups. Have they called back?

100
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:22,034
No, but I wanted to tell you,
when I lost my Cuddles...

101
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:24,077
...I hired a pet detective.

102
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,662
A what?

103
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,415
A pet detective.

104
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,794
Thanks, Martha, but we better
leave this to professionals.

105
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,214
Well, actually, he was quite good.

106
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:40,093
Pet detection is a very involved,
highly scientific process.

107
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,316
Like a glove!

108
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,662
Mr. Ventura here to see you.

109
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:50,706
Thanks, Martha.

110
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:52,541
Hi, I'm Melissa Robinson.

111
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,001
Pleasure to meet you.

112
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:56,170
Any trouble getting in?

113
00:13:56,503 --> 00:14:00,632
No, the guy with the rubber glove
was surprisingly gentle.

114
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:02,801
Security's tight Super Bowl week.

115
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:07,389
Why don't you have a seat?
I'll get right to the point.

116
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:12,728
Our mascot was stolen from his tank last
night. Are you familiar with Snowflake?

117
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:14,146
Negative.

118
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:18,025
We got him from Miami.
He's a rare bottle-nosed dolphin.

119
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:21,570
This is a new trick he was
going to do for the halftime show.

120
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,779
Let's go.

121
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:25,032
Blue 42, blue 42!

122
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:26,450
Hut, hut!

123
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:31,121
All right!

124
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,045
Come on, let's go!

125
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,551
Good boy!

126
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,436
Would you like an ashtray?

127
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:57,397
I don't smoke.

128
00:14:57,648 --> 00:14:59,733
It's a disgusting habit.

129
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,115
The police came today.

130
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,536
Apparently, the kidnappers
came in through the back with a--

131
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:13,956
Four-wheel-drive van,
loaded from the rear.

132
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:16,959
Roger, how you holding up?

133
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:21,213
If I'm walking funny it's because
I got two dozen reporters up my ass.

134
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,508
They've been asking me
about Snowflake all morning.

135
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:28,720
Who's he?

136
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:31,390
Roger Podacter, meet Ace Ventura.

137
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,517
He's our pet detective.

138
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:38,605
Nice to meet you. You came very
highly recommended by Martha Mertz.

139
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,232
Martha Mertz?

140
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,068
Oh, yeah, the bitch!

141
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:48,991
Pekingese, lost in Highland Park area.
She was half-dead when I found her.

142
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:50,576
Is that the tank?

143
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:52,619
Excuse me.

144
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:05,007
-Cops drain it?
-Yes, this morning.

145
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,094
If I'm not back in five minutes...

146
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:10,804
...just wait longer.

147
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:31,909
Captain's log, stardate 23.9, rounded
off to the nearest decimal point.

148
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:37,331
We've traveled back in time to save
an ancient species from annihilation.

149
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:38,707
So far...

150
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:43,212
...no signs of aquatic life,
but I am going to find it.

151
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,673
If I have to tear another black hole,
I'm going to find it!

152
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:50,469
I've got to, mister!

153
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,857
Oh, great!

154
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:06,068
I'll try to head them off.

155
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,278
Ace, get out of the tank.

156
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:10,155
I just can't do it, captain!

157
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,324
I don't have the power!

158
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:16,078
People!

159
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,664
I said, get out of the tank now!

160
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:22,543
For God's sake, Jim,
I'm a doctor, not a pool man!

161
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:24,211
Where's Snowflake?

162
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,422
Snowflake is not available right now.

163
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:32,094
Roger, I've been waiting all day.
I got to get a shot of his new trick!

164
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:33,846
What, is he sick?

165
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:51,947
People, people!

166
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:30,027
Lassie must be missing.

167
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,283
Make any good collars lately?

168
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,243
Or were they leashes?

169
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:49,630
Homicide, Ventura.

170
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,217
How are you gonna solve that one?

171
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:58,597
Good question, Aguado!

172
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,265
First, I'd establish a motive.

173
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:05,229
The killer saw the size of the bug's
dick and became insanely jealous.

174
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:12,277
Then I'd lose 30 pounds
porking his wife!

175
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:14,738
Come on!

176
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,700
Now, kiss and make up!

177
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:24,248
Excuse me.

178
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,000
I'd like to ass you a few questions.

179
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:29,086
This is not the time, Ace.

180
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:33,924
If Einhorn come down here and see me
talking to you or your ass, I'm history.

181
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:39,304
I can keep him under control. You have
to tell me who's on the Snowflake case.

182
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:42,975
I can't do nothing for you on that.
My hands are tied.

183
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:46,562
All right, that's it!
Now it's my turn!

184
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:49,189
Five minutes alone, that's all I need!

185
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:52,234
Better look alive.
Einhorn's on her way down.

186
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:54,987
Come on, now. Ace, please.

187
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:59,366
What's that matter?
Afraid I'll make a stink? Come on!

188
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,827
Aguado's working the case, all right?

189
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,245
Aguado!

190
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:05,747
Good call!

191
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,083
We're just a little busy now...

192
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:12,129
...with murderers and burglaries
and drug dealers. Things like that.

193
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:15,382
A missing dolphin isn't exactly
a high priority.

194
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:20,971
Now you've pissed him off.

195
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:25,392
-Would you give me a break?
-I can't hold him much longer!

196
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:26,643
My boss is coming!

197
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:29,771
Okay, look.

198
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:32,733
We ran a check with local
animal-rights groups.

199
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:37,112
We checked out the taxidermists
and we already checked on van rentals.

200
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:40,574
So far, nothing, nathin', nada.
All right?

201
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,076
Any unusual bets being made?

202
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:45,329
Of course! This is Super Bowl!

203
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:48,165
-What'd you find out about the tank?
-Nothing.

204
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:51,627
Tire tracks, an escape route.
A guard didn't see anything.

205
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:54,379
-That's it?
-I swear.

206
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:57,841
Now will you please get out of here
before I get in trouble?

207
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:03,013
Thank you for your cooperation.

208
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:06,225
By the way, do you have a mint?

209
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:08,685
Perhaps some Binaca?

210
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:23,575
Assholomio

211
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:26,703
Osadomia

212
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:33,293
Holy testicle Tuesday!

213
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:36,630
What the hell is he doing here?

214
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:38,465
I came to confess.

215
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:42,219
I was the second gunman
on the grassy knoll.

216
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:47,391
Spare me the routine. I know
you're working the Snowflake case.

217
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:51,562
May I suggest you yield
to the experts on this one?

218
00:21:51,854 --> 00:21:54,022
We'll find the porpoise.

219
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,485
Now I feel better.

220
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:02,865
Of course, that might not do any good.

221
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:06,618
Nobody's missing a porpoise.
It's a dolphin that's been taken.

222
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:09,538
The common harbor
porpoise has an abrupt snout...

223
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:13,834
...while the bottle-nosed dolphin,
or Tursiops truncatus...

224
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:18,547
...has an elongated beak, cone-shaped
teeth and a serrated dorsal appendage.

225
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:21,508
But I'm sure you already knew that.

226
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:24,094
That's what turns me on about you.

227
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:25,929
Your attention to detail.

228
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,515
Listen, pet dick...

229
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:32,728
...how would you like me
to make your life a living hell?

230
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:37,065
Well, I'm not really ready
for a relationship, Lois.

231
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:39,276
But thank you for asking.

232
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:45,824
Maybe I'll give you a call sometime.

233
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:47,409
Your number still 91 1 ?

234
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:49,494
Alrighty, then!

235
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:30,953
Excuse me. Is Greg here?

236
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:33,121
Thank you!

237
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:55,853
What's the password?

238
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:58,647
New England clam chowder.

239
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:01,859
Is that the red or the white?

240
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:05,028
I can never remember that!

241
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:07,197
White?

242
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:12,327
Hey, Woodstock!

243
00:24:12,536 --> 00:24:14,788
Hey, Saint Francis, how's it going?

244
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,500
Super, thanks for asking.
I hope you're having a lovely day.

245
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,751
Do you?

246
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:21,170
Don't I?

247
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:24,214
So what are you up to?

248
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:27,009
Just watching the fishes.

249
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:30,429
You see those blips?
That's a Norwegian whaling fleet.

250
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:34,516
I'm sending them new
directional coordinates.

251
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:36,977
They'll find Jimmy Hoffa...

252
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:39,021
...before they find any whales.

253
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:43,859
Gravy! So can you still tap into
the aquatic supply stores in the area?

254
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:45,444
Of course I can. Why?

255
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:47,863
I wanna trace the sale of equipment...

256
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:51,033
...for transporting or housing
a dolphin recently.

257
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:54,369
Come on, I thought you had
a challenge for me.

258
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:59,374
All right, we got marine winch, sling,
feeder fish, 20,000-gallon tank--

259
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:02,669
Wait a minute. Look here.

260
00:25:03,504 --> 00:25:06,798
That's a lot of equipment
for a civilian.

261
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:08,926
Ronald Camp? The billionaire?

262
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:11,553
Billionaire and rare-fish collector.

263
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:15,599
Really?

264
00:25:16,225 --> 00:25:17,893
That is the face of the enemy.

265
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:21,897
Always trying to get his greedy hands
on endangered species.

266
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:23,649
Hold on.

267
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:25,734
Camp is connected with the dolphins?

268
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:29,613
That sub genius gave them the land
the stadium's built on.

269
00:25:29,947 --> 00:25:34,993
And look, he's throwing another "I'm
the richest man in the universe" party.

270
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:41,041
Looks like it's time for me
to get myself a date.

271
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:51,677
I'm really going out on a limb here.
His social events are strictly A-list.

272
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:56,932
The date started good, Chuck, but before
we got to the party, she tensed up.

273
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:59,685
If you do anything to embarrass me....

274
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:01,812
What? Like this?

275
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:09,862
Hi, Captain Stubing.

276
00:26:10,112 --> 00:26:11,697
How are Gopher and Doc?

277
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:14,408
Permission to come aboard, sir.

278
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:35,554
I'm sorry, ladies.

279
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:40,350
Glad you could make it.

280
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:42,102
Thank you.

281
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,688
You look wonderful.

282
00:26:46,899 --> 00:26:48,692
And who is he, a friend?

283
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:52,863
No, this is--
This is my date.

284
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:56,450
He's a lawyer.

285
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,828
Does he have a name,
or should I call him "Lawyer"?

286
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:05,751
I'm sorry. This is Ace V--

287
00:27:07,211 --> 00:27:08,712
Tom Ace.

288
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:11,131
Pleasure to meet you.

289
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,342
Congratulations on all your success.

290
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:15,093
You smell terrific!

291
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:18,263
One of the first lessons we learned...

292
00:27:18,472 --> 00:27:19,556
...back at...

293
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:24,978
...Stanford was the growth of food-
poisoning claims against wealthy-people.

294
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,565
One could make quite
a lucrative law practice...

295
00:27:28,774 --> 00:27:30,025
...with little else.

296
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:34,321
How is everybody feeling tonight?

297
00:27:35,113 --> 00:27:37,115
Very, very well, thank you.

298
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:39,201
Look, honey...

299
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:41,203
...there's the hors d'oeuvres.

300
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:52,089
Are you insane? There is no way
that Camp stole Snowflake.

301
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:54,675
What are you trying to do?

302
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:02,432
Will you keep him occupied
while I work my magic, please?

303
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:09,940
Smooshy, isn't it?

304
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:22,619
We got a few cases
from my new dealer in Paris.

305
00:28:23,704 --> 00:28:25,205
Excuse me, Ron...

306
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:27,457
...I need to use the bathroom.

307
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:29,918
I think it's the pate.

308
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:31,879
Sure, it's over there.

309
00:28:32,963 --> 00:28:35,799
Stuff probably looks better
on the way out.

310
00:28:43,307 --> 00:28:45,767
He wasn't feeling well earlier today.

311
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:26,076
Gravy!

312
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:31,415
Don't worry, Snowflake.

313
00:30:31,665 --> 00:30:33,375
Ace Ventura's here.

314
00:30:36,712 --> 00:30:37,963
Yummy!

315
00:30:57,232 --> 00:30:58,483
Snowflake!

316
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,695
Here, Snowflake.

317
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,032
I've got a snack for you.

318
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:21,256
They're wonderful, aren't they?

319
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:23,967
Yes, they certainly are.

320
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:27,012
No matter what's going on in my life...

321
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:29,306
...I can always watch them swim...

322
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,975
...and be totally at peace.

323
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:40,984
It's not Snowflake!

324
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:43,445
It's not Snowflake!

325
00:31:44,947 --> 00:31:47,616
It's not Snowflake!

326
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:08,512
Are you sure your date is all right?

327
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:10,639
It's been an awfully long time.

328
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:12,224
Who, Tom?

329
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:14,726
Well, I'm sure he's fine.

330
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:27,447
Do not go in there!

331
00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:44,965
I'm sorry. I'll have the plumbing
checked immediately.

332
00:32:45,257 --> 00:32:49,344
Do that! If I'd been drinking out
of the toilet, I might've been killed.

333
00:32:49,595 --> 00:32:51,722
I'm sorry again, Mr. Ace.

334
00:32:57,561 --> 00:32:59,021
What're you doing?

335
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:00,772
I'm sorry, Ron.

336
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:02,357
What's he doing?

337
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:03,984
Let's go!

338
00:33:07,404 --> 00:33:08,864
Stop it!

339
00:33:10,073 --> 00:33:13,118
I don't even wanna know
why your pants are missing!

340
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:15,162
You could've cost me my job!

341
00:33:15,871 --> 00:33:19,458
So you found a pebble
in Snowflake's tank. I'll call CNN.

342
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:21,877
I found it in the filter, thank you.

343
00:33:22,127 --> 00:33:26,590
And it's not a pebble, it's a rare,
triangular cut orange amber.

344
00:33:28,258 --> 00:33:29,968
What're you talking about?

345
00:33:30,219 --> 00:33:33,430
Tonight I saw the same stone
in Camp's ring.

346
00:33:33,722 --> 00:33:35,807
I thought you said Camp didn't do it.

347
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:38,435
No, his ring wasn't missing a stone.

348
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:41,688
But whoever was in that tank
had a ring just like his.

349
00:33:41,897 --> 00:33:43,774
Ring? What ring?

350
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:49,780
The 1984 Dolphin AFC championship ring.

351
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:55,494
I find the ring with a missing stone,
I find Snowflake.

352
00:33:56,662 --> 00:33:58,413
How you gonna do that?

353
00:34:00,457 --> 00:34:01,792
Simple.

354
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:10,008
Loser!

355
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:12,469
Why don't you learn how to drive, pal?

356
00:34:14,471 --> 00:34:15,722
You wanna play?

357
00:34:25,691 --> 00:34:26,942
Damn it!

358
00:36:50,419 --> 00:36:52,504
That stone could've come from anywhere.

359
00:36:52,754 --> 00:36:54,423
It could've come from...

360
00:36:54,673 --> 00:36:57,634
...a necklace or a pendant, an earring.

361
00:36:57,926 --> 00:37:02,181
It came from an '84 AFC
championship ring.

362
00:37:06,268 --> 00:37:11,148
Einhorn thinks it may have been
an animal-rights group. You know FAN?

363
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:16,570
Free Animals Now, started by Chelsea,
daughter of industrialist Fisher Gamble?

364
00:37:16,778 --> 00:37:18,822
Over half a million members worldwide?

365
00:37:19,031 --> 00:37:20,949
No. Who are they?

366
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:22,826
Did you know...

367
00:37:23,118 --> 00:37:27,414
...they sent letters to college teams
demanding the release of their mascots?

368
00:37:27,623 --> 00:37:29,166
What do you feed your dog?

369
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:32,961
Dog food. Why?

370
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,630
He is miserable!

371
00:37:35,172 --> 00:37:36,590
What are you talking about?

372
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:40,802
He's very unhappy. I feel sorry for him.
Bad diet, isolated environment.

373
00:37:41,053 --> 00:37:43,138
It's amazing he's still alive.

374
00:37:45,057 --> 00:37:49,394
You're just mad because your stupid
pebble theory didn't work out.

375
00:37:49,603 --> 00:37:51,021
You can't express anger.

376
00:37:51,772 --> 00:37:53,857
Yeah? And you're ugly.

377
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:58,737
I'm not even gonna talk to you.
Would you please leave?

378
00:37:58,946 --> 00:38:00,822
Why? So you can beat him?

379
00:38:01,073 --> 00:38:02,074
Fatty!

380
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,326
You're unbelievable!

381
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:06,828
Hiring you was the biggest mistake
I ever made.

382
00:38:07,037 --> 00:38:09,915
Well, why don't you cry about it,
saddlebags?

383
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:16,421
You like her, huh?

384
00:38:17,256 --> 00:38:18,966
Yeah, she's all right.

385
00:38:28,517 --> 00:38:30,602
Look, Melissa, I....

386
00:38:34,273 --> 00:38:38,485
I'm here at the North Beach Towers
condo complex in north Miami...

387
00:38:38,735 --> 00:38:42,406
...where Roger Podacter, head of
operations for the Miami Dolphins...

388
00:38:42,656 --> 00:38:44,741
...has apparently committed suicide...

389
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:48,745
...allegedly leaping to his death
from his 20th-story balcony....

390
00:38:57,838 --> 00:38:59,298
You okay?

391
00:38:59,673 --> 00:39:02,134
I told you. I was in my apartment...

392
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:03,510
...across the hall.

393
00:39:04,136 --> 00:39:05,929
I heard a scream...

394
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,140
...so I called the manager.

395
00:39:08,682 --> 00:39:12,060
The place was empty, except for the dog.

396
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:14,813
I opened the balcony door
and looked out...

397
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:17,191
...splat, bang, pancake time.

398
00:39:17,441 --> 00:39:19,526
Okay, thank you very much.

399
00:39:24,823 --> 00:39:26,200
Hi there, fella.

400
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,868
Have a bad night?

401
00:39:38,754 --> 00:39:39,922
So...

402
00:39:40,297 --> 00:39:42,382
...animals can sense evil.

403
00:39:42,633 --> 00:39:44,468
Who let Dr. Doolittle in?

404
00:39:44,718 --> 00:39:47,179
Lieutenant, he came with Miss Robinson.

405
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:52,351
This is police business. We'll let you
know if the coroner finds a tick.

406
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:56,104
Face it--

407
00:39:56,313 --> 00:39:58,398
Forget it. She's right.

408
00:39:58,649 --> 00:39:59,650
Besides...

409
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:04,404
...I wouldn't want someone tracing
my steps, pointing out my mistakes.

410
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:20,254
So...

411
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:24,258
...you don't think this is an obvious
suicide, Mr. Pet Detective?

412
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:29,179
I wouldn't say that. There's plenty
of evidence here to support your theory.

413
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:32,724
Except, of course, for that
spot of blood on the railing.

414
00:40:37,604 --> 00:40:39,857
May I tell you what I think happened?

415
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:41,483
Alrighty, then!

416
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:45,362
Roger Podacter went out after work,
had a few drinks, then came home.

417
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:49,366
He wasn't alone. Someone else
was with him. There was a struggle...

418
00:40:49,616 --> 00:40:52,160
...and he was thrown over that balcony.

419
00:40:52,411 --> 00:40:54,872
Roger Podacter didn't commit suicide.

420
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:56,915
He was murdered.

421
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:00,961
That's a very entertaining story...

422
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:05,424
...but real detectives have to worry
about that little thing called...

423
00:41:05,716 --> 00:41:07,217
...evidence.

424
00:41:09,553 --> 00:41:11,638
I think I heard a toilet flush.

425
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:14,183
Maybe somebody lost a turtle.

426
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:19,313
Well, I....

427
00:41:19,938 --> 00:41:22,274
I guess I'm out of my league here.

428
00:41:24,484 --> 00:41:25,986
Good work.

429
00:41:33,535 --> 00:41:37,206
There is just
one more thing, lieutenant.

430
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,001
This woman is Roger Podacter's neighbor.

431
00:41:41,251 --> 00:41:43,545
She said she heard a scream. Right?

432
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:46,757
And you had to open
the balcony door when you came in?

433
00:41:47,007 --> 00:41:50,511
-That's true.
-You're sure you had to open this door?

434
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:51,762
I'm certain.

435
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:54,014
What's the point, Ventura?

436
00:41:54,723 --> 00:41:56,642
Only this.

437
00:42:09,363 --> 00:42:12,741
This is double-paned, soundproof glass.
There is no way...

438
00:42:12,991 --> 00:42:16,578
...she could have heard
Podacter scream on the way down.

439
00:42:16,828 --> 00:42:19,164
The scream she heard
came from inside...

440
00:42:19,414 --> 00:42:24,294
...before he was thrown off the balcony.
The murderer closed the door upon going.

441
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:29,466
Can you feel that, buddy?

442
00:42:31,552 --> 00:42:35,806
I have exorcized the demons!

443
00:42:37,975 --> 00:42:40,519
This house is clear.

444
00:42:41,937 --> 00:42:43,564
-Losers.
-Get him out of here!

445
00:42:44,147 --> 00:42:47,317
-Losers! Losers!
-Let's go, Ace.

446
00:42:48,026 --> 00:42:49,194
Losers.

447
00:42:51,822 --> 00:42:52,823
Come on.

448
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:54,825
Back to the zoo.

449
00:42:58,078 --> 00:42:59,580
What are you thinking?

450
00:43:00,372 --> 00:43:02,666
This whole thing is connected, somehow.

451
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:05,752
I want to find that other ring.

452
00:43:07,713 --> 00:43:09,882
Ace, you checked all the rings.

453
00:43:10,132 --> 00:43:12,301
Receipts? What about receipts?

454
00:43:12,551 --> 00:43:14,219
There's gotta be receipts.

455
00:43:23,312 --> 00:43:26,690
That was pretty impressive,
what you did at the apartment.

456
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:29,109
You don't have to tell me.

457
00:43:29,568 --> 00:43:31,111
I was there.

458
00:43:33,197 --> 00:43:37,034
Maybe you should've joined the police
force, become a real detective.

459
00:43:37,326 --> 00:43:39,244
I don't do humans.

460
00:43:41,538 --> 00:43:43,165
You really love animals.

461
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:46,668
If it gets cold enough.

462
00:43:48,587 --> 00:43:51,215
No, I have a kinship with them.

463
00:43:51,465 --> 00:43:52,966
I understand them.

464
00:43:54,968 --> 00:43:56,887
Wanna hear something spooky?

465
00:43:57,095 --> 00:43:58,347
Sure.

466
00:44:01,058 --> 00:44:05,395
One time when I was about 12, I had
a dream that I was being followed by...

467
00:44:05,646 --> 00:44:07,439
...a big dog with rabies.

468
00:44:07,689 --> 00:44:09,608
He had these bloodshot eyes...

469
00:44:09,816 --> 00:44:11,652
...and foam came out of his mouth.

470
00:44:12,069 --> 00:44:16,990
No matter how fast I ran, he just kept
gaining on me and gaining on me.

471
00:44:19,243 --> 00:44:22,079
Then just before I got
to my front door...

472
00:44:22,412 --> 00:44:24,873
...he jumped and sank his teeth in.

473
00:44:26,959 --> 00:44:28,836
That's when I woke up...

474
00:44:29,086 --> 00:44:32,172
...and felt the back of my neck.
Check that out.

475
00:44:35,425 --> 00:44:36,760
Bastard!

476
00:44:38,095 --> 00:44:40,764
I'm sorry, I just couldn't help myself.

477
00:44:41,682 --> 00:44:43,350
Want to know why I do this?

478
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:45,310
I'm not sure anymore.

479
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:47,020
You better be sure...

480
00:44:47,729 --> 00:44:50,190
...because once you get
inside my head...

481
00:44:50,524 --> 00:44:52,192
...there's no turning back.

482
00:45:03,787 --> 00:45:04,788
So....

483
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:09,001
Are these all? There's only a dozen.

484
00:45:09,251 --> 00:45:11,336
Maybe it's in another file,
in the back.

485
00:45:11,587 --> 00:45:13,213
Who the hell is that?

486
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:14,882
What?

487
00:45:18,927 --> 00:45:20,179
That.

488
00:45:20,804 --> 00:45:22,806
Who the hell is that?

489
00:45:23,473 --> 00:45:26,894
That's Ray Finkle, the kicker.
Don't you know who he is?

490
00:45:28,687 --> 00:45:30,439
Why isn't he in this picture?

491
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:39,740
This was taken earlier in the year.
Ray Finkle wasn't added till mid-season.

492
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,707
He missed the final field goal
in the Super Bowl that year.

493
00:45:48,957 --> 00:45:50,584
Cost the Dolphins the game.

494
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:53,253
But he got himself a ring, didn't he?

495
00:45:54,546 --> 00:45:55,797
Definitely.

496
00:45:56,006 --> 00:45:58,884
"Replacement kicker
having a great year."

497
00:45:59,134 --> 00:46:01,845
"Ready for Super Bowl,
all-star kicker boasts."

498
00:46:02,054 --> 00:46:05,432
"Field goal sails wide,
Dolphins lose Super Bowl."

499
00:46:05,891 --> 00:46:08,519
"The kick heard round the world."

500
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:12,147
That was Finkle.
The Dolphins lost by one point.

501
00:46:13,398 --> 00:46:16,068
Poor guy.

502
00:46:16,276 --> 00:46:18,570
Poor guy with a motive, baby.

503
00:46:18,946 --> 00:46:20,489
Where is he now?

504
00:46:20,822 --> 00:46:23,951
I heard he went back
to his hometown in Collier County.

505
00:46:24,826 --> 00:46:28,455
Really?

506
00:46:30,624 --> 00:46:32,793
You're gonna drop me off before you go?

507
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:36,421
No way. You shouldn't be
left alone right now.

508
00:46:36,672 --> 00:46:39,216
It might not be safe at your apartment.

509
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:41,802
What do you suggest?

510
00:47:26,221 --> 00:47:27,764
Oh, my God!

511
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:30,309
Oh, my God.

512
00:47:31,768 --> 00:47:33,604
Three times?

513
00:47:34,188 --> 00:47:36,899
I'm sorry, that's never
happened to me before.

514
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:39,443
I must be tired.

515
00:47:42,946 --> 00:47:44,698
Okay, I'm ready again.

516
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:38,752
I'm looking for Ray Finkle...

517
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,797
...and a clean pair of shorts.

518
00:48:42,005 --> 00:48:44,925
What do you know about Ray Finkle?

519
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:50,138
Soccer-style kicker.
Graduated from Collier High, 1976.

520
00:48:50,389 --> 00:48:54,142
Stetson University honors graduate,
1980. Holds two NCAA records.

521
00:48:54,393 --> 00:48:55,978
Most points and distance.

522
00:48:56,186 --> 00:48:59,064
Nickname, "The Mule."
The only pro athlete from here.

523
00:48:59,273 --> 00:49:02,150
And one hell of a model American.

524
00:49:07,948 --> 00:49:10,701
Are you another one of them
Hard Copy guys?

525
00:49:10,951 --> 00:49:11,952
No, sir.

526
00:49:12,202 --> 00:49:13,704
I'm just a big Finkle fan.

527
00:49:15,455 --> 00:49:17,708
This is my Graceland, sir.

528
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:20,627
Will you put that gun down?

529
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:24,256
The boy is a fan of our son.

530
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:27,217
So nice to meet you.

531
00:49:27,467 --> 00:49:28,927
I'm Ray's mother...

532
00:49:29,178 --> 00:49:30,888
...and this is Ray's father.

533
00:49:31,597 --> 00:49:33,432
It's a real honor!

534
00:49:34,057 --> 00:49:37,019
It's an honor to have you here.

535
00:49:38,687 --> 00:49:41,607
My Ray is so appreciative of his fans.

536
00:49:41,857 --> 00:49:44,318
He'll be so pleased you stopped by.

537
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:46,778
Are you expecting Ray anytime soon?

538
00:49:47,029 --> 00:49:49,656
Oh, yes. I expect him home any minute.

539
00:49:50,365 --> 00:49:53,619
Would you like some cookies?
I just baked them.

540
00:49:53,911 --> 00:49:55,537
Yummy!

541
00:50:01,835 --> 00:50:04,004
Ray Finkle's house.

542
00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:06,965
I can't wait to meet him.

543
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:11,845
Ray ain't coming home.

544
00:50:13,597 --> 00:50:15,724
But your wife expects him any minute.

545
00:50:15,933 --> 00:50:18,602
She expects him home any minute.

546
00:50:19,645 --> 00:50:23,398
See, the engine's running
but there's nobody behind the wheel.

547
00:50:24,942 --> 00:50:26,026
Eight years ago...

548
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:30,405
...our son escaped from
Shady Acres Mental Hospital.

549
00:50:30,614 --> 00:50:33,492
And they're still bugging us
to pick up his stuff.

550
00:50:33,742 --> 00:50:37,371
It was all that Dan Marino's fault.
Everyone knows that.

551
00:50:37,704 --> 00:50:40,916
If he'd held the ball laces out,
like he's supposed to...

552
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:43,544
...Ray wouldn't have missed the kick.

553
00:50:43,877 --> 00:50:48,090
Dan Marino should die
of gonorrhea and rot in hell.

554
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:50,342
Would you like a cookie, son?

555
00:50:53,136 --> 00:50:54,555
What do you know?

556
00:50:55,097 --> 00:50:56,974
They're little footballs.

557
00:50:57,182 --> 00:50:58,559
Laces out.

558
00:51:00,102 --> 00:51:02,938
When Ray gets back and starts
kicking again...

559
00:51:03,188 --> 00:51:05,524
...he'll never even know he was gone.

560
00:51:05,774 --> 00:51:08,652
I've kept his room
just the way he left it.

561
00:51:31,175 --> 00:51:32,509
Oh, boy!

562
00:51:33,093 --> 00:51:35,554
What a sports nut, huh?

563
00:51:47,357 --> 00:51:48,317
May I?

564
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:50,611
Oh, yes, by all means.

565
00:51:54,156 --> 00:51:57,451
Five seconds to go here
in Super Bowl 17.

566
00:51:57,701 --> 00:51:59,494
Dolphins trailing the 49ers...

567
00:51:59,703 --> 00:52:03,457
...by one. This will
win the game for Miami.

568
00:52:03,749 --> 00:52:05,417
There's the snap.

569
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:06,835
Marino holds.

570
00:52:07,127 --> 00:52:08,295
The kick...

571
00:52:08,921 --> 00:52:11,006
...and it's high. No, it's...

572
00:52:11,215 --> 00:52:12,132
...no good.

573
00:52:12,382 --> 00:52:16,303
Ray Finkle blew a 26-yard field goal!

574
00:52:16,553 --> 00:52:18,430
I don't believe it!

575
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:20,390
The Dolphins lose!

576
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:24,811
The Dolphins lose!
The Dolphins lose the Super Bowl!

577
00:52:26,438 --> 00:52:28,815
-Melissa, it's Ace!
-Where are you?

578
00:52:29,107 --> 00:52:32,694
I'm in psychoville, and Finkle's
the mayor. Where's Marino?

579
00:52:32,945 --> 00:52:34,112
Why?

580
00:52:34,321 --> 00:52:37,491
He's about to join Snowflake.
I've gotta know where he is!

581
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:41,954
He has a commercial shoot
at the Bogart Sound Stage.

582
00:52:42,162 --> 00:52:45,249
Call the police. Get extra
security over there. Now!

583
00:52:45,499 --> 00:52:47,459
Ace, what's going on?

584
00:52:50,587 --> 00:52:51,672
Thought I left?

585
00:52:53,715 --> 00:52:55,509
I'm really gonna go this time.

586
00:53:04,184 --> 00:53:06,353
Here we go, folks. Very quiet.

587
00:53:06,603 --> 00:53:07,479
Action!

588
00:53:07,729 --> 00:53:11,775
I'm Dan Marino, and if anyone knows
the value of protection, it's me.

589
00:53:17,948 --> 00:53:21,076
So I take care of the hands
that take care of me...

590
00:53:21,743 --> 00:53:22,995
...with Isotoner gloves!

591
00:53:23,287 --> 00:53:25,205
Cut! Again from the top.

592
00:53:25,414 --> 00:53:26,498
I said, cut!

593
00:53:26,748 --> 00:53:28,000
Guys, it's a cut!

594
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:30,627
What the hell are they doing?

595
00:53:30,878 --> 00:53:32,504
That's a cut!

596
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:40,137
-What is this, a rewrite?
-Shut up!

597
00:53:44,474 --> 00:53:46,018
-Where'd they go?
-Over there!

598
00:53:46,268 --> 00:53:47,269
Let's go!

599
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:55,944
Excuse me, gentlemen!

600
00:53:56,195 --> 00:53:57,279
Pet detective!

601
00:54:05,996 --> 00:54:06,997
Come on!

602
00:54:07,206 --> 00:54:08,457
What's wrong?

603
00:54:08,707 --> 00:54:10,209
Can't you hit me?

604
00:54:37,653 --> 00:54:39,613
Have there been ransom demands?

605
00:54:39,863 --> 00:54:42,324
There's no communication
with the kidnappers.

606
00:54:42,533 --> 00:54:44,493
Will the Super Bowl be postponed?

607
00:54:44,743 --> 00:54:46,245
The game is on as scheduled.

608
00:54:46,495 --> 00:54:48,413
Why weren't we told
about the kidnapping?

609
00:54:48,622 --> 00:54:51,667
Secrecy was essential.
We couldn't risk any interference.

610
00:54:51,875 --> 00:54:55,879
-Are the crimes related?
-I'm sorry, I can't comment further.

611
00:54:56,129 --> 00:54:58,048
Now, if you'll excuse me....

612
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:02,302
Get me the autopsy on Podacter!

613
00:55:02,553 --> 00:55:05,389
Aguado, send out a memo:
No one talks to the press!

614
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:08,183
And somebody get me some coffee!

615
00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:12,312
Tonight on Miami Vice,
Crockett gets the boss a coffee!

616
00:55:13,856 --> 00:55:17,776
When I get out of that bathroom,
you'd better be gone!

617
00:55:18,443 --> 00:55:20,487
Is it number one or number two?

618
00:55:20,779 --> 00:55:22,990
I just wanna know how much time I have.

619
00:55:25,033 --> 00:55:28,036
By the way,
I went ahead and solved that...

620
00:55:28,287 --> 00:55:31,248
...pesky Snowflake-Podacter-
Marino thing.

621
00:55:31,957 --> 00:55:35,627
You ever heard of a former
Dolphin kicker named Ray Finkle?

622
00:55:42,467 --> 00:55:44,261
All right, Ventura...

623
00:55:45,512 --> 00:55:46,680
...make it quick.

624
00:55:47,097 --> 00:55:50,225
I found a rare stone
at the bottom of Snowflake's tank.

625
00:55:50,475 --> 00:55:53,145
It belongs to a Dolphin '84 AFC
championship ring.

626
00:55:53,395 --> 00:55:56,523
It would've been a Super Bowl ring,
but Ray missed the kick.

627
00:55:56,732 --> 00:55:58,734
Blames the whole thing on Marino.

628
00:55:58,984 --> 00:56:03,614
We're talking paranoid, delusional
psychosis. I saw the guy's room.

629
00:56:03,822 --> 00:56:06,074
Cozy, if you're Hannibal Lecter.

630
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:09,244
So how does Roger Podacter fit in?

631
00:56:09,786 --> 00:56:14,458
My guess is, Finkle was snooping around.
Podacter recognized him. End of story.

632
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:19,338
As for Snowflake, they gave him Finkle's
number, taught him how to kick a goal.

633
00:56:19,546 --> 00:56:21,381
Finkle took it personally.

634
00:56:23,717 --> 00:56:25,511
So where is Finkle now?

635
00:56:25,719 --> 00:56:30,182
Busted out of a mental institute. He's
been plotting his revenge for years.

636
00:56:30,432 --> 00:56:33,101
Waiting for the perfect time
to get back at them.

637
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:35,187
The time when it'd hurt them most:

638
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:37,564
Super Bowl time.

639
00:56:37,814 --> 00:56:40,192
Man, I'm tired of being right!

640
00:56:44,571 --> 00:56:46,198
Congratulations.

641
00:56:47,407 --> 00:56:50,244
You've done some fine detective work...

642
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,288
...Ace.

643
00:56:54,998 --> 00:56:57,626
I'm sorry, could you
speak into my good ear?

644
00:56:57,876 --> 00:57:00,003
I thought I heard you call me Ace.

645
00:57:00,546 --> 00:57:05,175
Maybe I was wrong about you.
Maybe you are more than just a pet dick.

646
00:57:13,392 --> 00:57:16,019
Your gun is digging into my hip.

647
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:17,729
What's wrong?

648
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:20,440
Want me to read you your rights?

649
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,026
Maybe later.

650
00:57:26,196 --> 00:57:27,281
What is it?

651
00:57:27,573 --> 00:57:29,157
That bony little bitch...

652
00:57:29,408 --> 00:57:31,118
...Melissa Robinson?

653
00:57:31,827 --> 00:57:33,912
You just don't do anything for me.

654
00:57:35,372 --> 00:57:36,623
Down, boy!

655
00:57:38,709 --> 00:57:41,420
Everything okay in here?
I heard some commotion.

656
00:57:41,879 --> 00:57:43,463
Fine, sergeant.

657
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:45,591
You want me to throw him out?

658
00:57:46,425 --> 00:57:48,886
Why don't you throw yourself out?

659
00:57:50,929 --> 00:57:52,181
Yes, ma'am.

660
00:57:55,392 --> 00:57:58,353
Ace, I want you to leave
everything to us.

661
00:57:58,604 --> 00:58:01,857
I can't do that, lieutenant.
I was hired to find Snowflake.

662
00:58:02,107 --> 00:58:03,775
When we find Marino...

663
00:58:04,026 --> 00:58:06,069
...we'll deliver Snowflake.

664
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,405
When I find Snowflake...

665
00:58:09,823 --> 00:58:11,617
...I'll deliver Marino.

666
00:58:23,754 --> 00:58:24,922
Melissa, it's Ace!

667
00:58:25,214 --> 00:58:28,091
What are you doing here?
It's the middle of the night.

668
00:58:28,842 --> 00:58:30,844
You have to commit me.

669
00:58:32,012 --> 00:58:35,474
Finkle escaped from Shady Acres.
They still have his stuff.

670
00:58:35,724 --> 00:58:37,976
They aren't gonna let us look around.

671
00:58:38,227 --> 00:58:39,311
I know.

672
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:42,397
It's a good thing
I'm a master of disguise.

673
00:58:42,648 --> 00:58:43,649
Mrs. Robinson...

674
00:58:44,024 --> 00:58:46,068
...I'm Dr. Handly.

675
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:48,695
Now who is it you want us to look at?

676
00:58:48,987 --> 00:58:50,239
My brother...

677
00:58:50,864 --> 00:58:52,032
...Larry.

678
00:58:56,245 --> 00:58:58,789
I'm ready to go in.
Just give me a chance!

679
00:58:58,997 --> 00:59:01,959
I know there's a lot riding on it,
but it's all psychological.

680
00:59:02,251 --> 00:59:03,961
Just gotta stay positive.

681
00:59:06,129 --> 00:59:09,299
I'm gonna execute
a buttonhook pattern, super slow-mo.

682
00:59:37,327 --> 00:59:38,579
Let's see that...

683
00:59:38,871 --> 00:59:40,497
...in an instant replay.

684
00:59:55,846 --> 00:59:59,141
Your brother won't be
the first football pro we've treated.

685
00:59:59,391 --> 01:00:02,102
-Is that right?
-Yes, we're very sensitive...

686
01:00:02,352 --> 01:00:04,813
...to the stress athletes
have to endure.

687
01:00:05,063 --> 01:00:07,024
I'm open! I'm open!

688
01:00:07,858 --> 01:00:09,568
I'm open!

689
01:00:10,402 --> 01:00:12,863
We'll do some preliminary evaluations...

690
01:00:13,155 --> 01:00:15,324
...but I think he'll fit in nicely here.

691
01:00:15,574 --> 01:00:17,159
Over here!

692
01:00:19,369 --> 01:00:21,079
351 !

693
01:00:21,538 --> 01:00:23,332
351 !

694
01:00:23,582 --> 01:00:25,542
Rover, sit! Hut, hut!

695
01:00:28,795 --> 01:00:31,757
He seems to have some difficulty
letting go of the game.

696
01:00:32,257 --> 01:00:34,343
Has he had a history of mental illness?

697
01:00:35,802 --> 01:00:37,596
As long as I've known him.

698
01:00:39,515 --> 01:00:42,142
This is one of our therapy rooms.

699
01:00:42,935 --> 01:00:46,438
And we do arts and crafts
out here in the courtyard.

700
01:00:46,688 --> 01:00:50,609
And this is the storage room.
Down the hallway we have another--

701
01:00:50,859 --> 01:00:52,361
Halftime!

702
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:10,254
He'll be fine there by himself
for the next 20 minutes.

703
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:14,174
I'll show you the dormitories, then.

704
01:02:25,871 --> 01:02:27,664
Isotoners.

705
01:02:47,059 --> 01:02:49,394
Obsess much?

706
01:02:51,021 --> 01:02:52,648
Where are you going?

707
01:02:52,898 --> 01:02:55,901
-To clean the storage room.
-No, clean the cafeteria.

708
01:02:56,109 --> 01:02:58,195
I don't tell you how to do your job.

709
01:02:58,445 --> 01:03:00,072
The schedule says...

710
01:03:00,322 --> 01:03:02,699
-...clean the cafeteria.
-I know what I'm doing.

711
01:03:02,991 --> 01:03:04,243
You should've done it earlier.

712
01:03:04,493 --> 01:03:07,746
Man, come on. Cafeteria, my ass!
I'm cleaning in here!

713
01:03:07,955 --> 01:03:10,040
You take breaks too long. You smoke--

714
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:12,543
Man, you're a pain in the ass!

715
01:03:35,315 --> 01:03:37,776
"Search called off for missing hiker."

716
01:03:38,485 --> 01:03:40,946
"A search ended today
when rescue workers...

717
01:03:41,238 --> 01:03:44,825
...were unable to find the body
of Lois Einhorn."

718
01:03:46,451 --> 01:03:48,620
A hiker missing since Friday?

719
01:03:48,871 --> 01:03:50,455
Lois Einhorn?

720
01:03:51,832 --> 01:03:54,459
Holy shitballs!

721
01:04:08,265 --> 01:04:11,018
What're you doing out here?
Get back to work!

722
01:04:40,172 --> 01:04:41,423
"Love, Roger?"

723
01:04:50,015 --> 01:04:51,266
Ace, it's E.

724
01:04:51,475 --> 01:04:54,603
You think the article you found
was something?

725
01:04:54,853 --> 01:04:57,314
I got a note from Roger to Einhorn...

726
01:04:57,606 --> 01:04:59,942
...thanking her for a wonderful evening.

727
01:05:00,192 --> 01:05:02,736
Something ain't stirring
the Kool-Aid, man.

728
01:05:03,028 --> 01:05:04,905
Wiggles, rewind.

729
01:05:09,076 --> 01:05:12,454
What the hell does Lois Einhorn
have to do with Ray Finkle?

730
01:05:14,248 --> 01:05:15,832
Come on, think!

731
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:19,211
Finkle and Einhorn, in it together.
How? Why?

732
01:05:26,343 --> 01:05:27,886
All right! Here we go.

733
01:05:28,136 --> 01:05:31,348
Answer's right there!
Just gotta get blood to the brain!

734
01:05:31,932 --> 01:05:34,601
Finkle and Einhorn! Finkle and Einhorn!

735
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:37,187
Finkle and Einhorn! Finkle and Einhorn!

736
01:05:51,326 --> 01:05:52,661
Quitter!

737
01:05:54,830 --> 01:05:56,748
What do you want?

738
01:05:58,292 --> 01:06:00,836
I don't have any food for you.

739
01:06:01,295 --> 01:06:03,964
I have to have money to buy food.

740
01:06:04,214 --> 01:06:07,593
I have to have a dolphin to get money.
Do you see a dolphin here?

741
01:06:16,059 --> 01:06:17,311
Let's face it...

742
01:06:17,561 --> 01:06:19,605
...your master is a loser.

743
01:06:36,705 --> 01:06:38,665
What the...?

744
01:06:40,626 --> 01:06:42,544
That's it.

745
01:06:44,713 --> 01:06:46,256
That's it!

746
01:06:46,548 --> 01:06:49,009
Einhorn is Finkle.

747
01:06:49,301 --> 01:06:51,678
Finkle is Einhorn!

748
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:54,348
Einhorn is a man!

749
01:06:55,849 --> 01:06:57,851
Oh, my God!

750
01:06:58,268 --> 01:07:00,812
Einhorn is a man!

751
01:07:57,452 --> 01:07:59,830
"Your gun is digging into my hip."

752
01:08:00,789 --> 01:08:02,165
God!

753
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:08,338
And the big story in this
Super Bowl game is the abduction...

754
01:08:08,547 --> 01:08:11,633
...of Miami's starting quarterback,
Dan Marino.

755
01:08:11,884 --> 01:08:15,012
It's gotta be a strain
on this Miami team, Bob....

756
01:08:53,342 --> 01:08:56,845
What's the matter, Dan?
Aren't you having fun?

757
01:08:57,054 --> 01:09:00,891
I just love Super Bowl Sunday.
Don't you, Dan?

758
01:09:01,141 --> 01:09:03,435
A magical afternoon...

759
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:06,063
...where dreams are made...

760
01:09:07,147 --> 01:09:08,649
...and crushed.

761
01:09:08,982 --> 01:09:12,486
Look, if you want tickets,
you're going about it the wrong way.

762
01:09:14,029 --> 01:09:17,616
Do I look familiar to you?
Does it seem as if we've...

763
01:09:17,824 --> 01:09:19,993
...met someplace before?

764
01:09:20,410 --> 01:09:22,955
I don't know.
I get hit in the head a lot.

765
01:09:23,497 --> 01:09:25,666
Now the coin toss.

766
01:09:26,416 --> 01:09:27,668
Kickoff time.

767
01:09:28,669 --> 01:09:30,295
My favorite thing.

768
01:09:36,969 --> 01:09:38,512
Laces out!

769
01:09:57,781 --> 01:10:01,285
I made some refreshments, Dan.

770
01:10:02,578 --> 01:10:05,038
Would you like some refreshments, Dan?

771
01:10:06,290 --> 01:10:08,292
I'll be right back, Dan.

772
01:10:38,447 --> 01:10:42,618
I don't know how much psycho-woman's
paying you, but I'll double it.

773
01:10:42,868 --> 01:10:46,079
Sorry.
"Psycho-woman" keeps us out of prison.

774
01:10:47,164 --> 01:10:49,041
Snowflake, here you go. Come on.

775
01:10:49,249 --> 01:10:50,959
Check it out, Marino.

776
01:10:51,168 --> 01:10:53,504
I'm throwing passes to a dolphin.

777
01:11:03,931 --> 01:11:04,765
Damn!

778
01:11:04,973 --> 01:11:06,767
Go get some more fish!

779
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:08,644
I'm gonna kill that dolphin.

780
01:11:09,937 --> 01:11:11,563
Lovely party.

781
01:11:11,813 --> 01:11:13,565
Pity I wasn't invited.

782
01:11:26,078 --> 01:11:28,163
Where the hell's the smelt?

783
01:11:35,838 --> 01:11:39,132
Unconscious. Exactly as I planned.

784
01:11:46,849 --> 01:11:48,308
What the hell was that?

785
01:11:59,444 --> 01:12:00,529
Shit!

786
01:12:06,285 --> 01:12:09,288
What happened? What's going on?

787
01:12:09,538 --> 01:12:10,497
You okay?

788
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:12,040
Guess what?

789
01:12:12,499 --> 01:12:13,500
It's naptime!

790
01:12:16,211 --> 01:12:17,671
What a hit!

791
01:12:20,591 --> 01:12:21,925
Heads up!

792
01:12:28,265 --> 01:12:29,349
Who are you?

793
01:12:30,642 --> 01:12:34,062
Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.
I've been sent with a special play:

794
01:12:34,313 --> 01:12:35,939
The quarterback sneak.

795
01:12:37,024 --> 01:12:37,858
Penalty!

796
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,236
Too many men on the field.

797
01:12:41,862 --> 01:12:43,864
I warned you, Ventura.

798
01:12:44,615 --> 01:12:46,116
Whatever happened to "Ace"?

799
01:12:46,325 --> 01:12:48,118
Good question.

800
01:12:48,702 --> 01:12:53,207
Be careful with that phone.
In time, you could develop a tumor.

801
01:12:53,832 --> 01:12:56,168
Aguado, it's Lieutenant Einhorn.

802
01:12:56,418 --> 01:13:00,172
Send some men over
to the Hallandale yacht basin.

803
01:13:00,422 --> 01:13:02,799
I've got the kidnapper
trapped in the warehouse.

804
01:13:03,383 --> 01:13:05,928
It's Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.

805
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:12,809
Code 1 1 in progress,
343 Victorville Road...

806
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:14,645
...at the Palmdale basin.

807
01:13:14,853 --> 01:13:18,148
Officer needs backup.
Suspect's name: Ace Ventura...

808
01:13:18,398 --> 01:13:20,943
...should be considered
armed and dangerous.

809
01:13:21,693 --> 01:13:24,363
It's Ace. We gotta break out of here.

810
01:13:26,990 --> 01:13:28,325
Is he in trouble?

811
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:30,953
Don't worry, if there's
one thing I know...

812
01:13:31,245 --> 01:13:33,455
...there's nothing Ace can't handle.

813
01:13:34,081 --> 01:13:36,375
Don't kill me!

814
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:39,670
Please!

815
01:13:40,128 --> 01:13:42,422
I'll never tell anyone, I swear.

816
01:13:42,673 --> 01:13:45,008
-He's who you want! Kill him!
-Kill him!

817
01:13:45,259 --> 01:13:48,011
Kill him! He held the ball, remember?

818
01:13:48,262 --> 01:13:49,847
Come on, look at him!

819
01:13:50,097 --> 01:13:51,348
-Crybaby!
-Jock!

820
01:13:51,598 --> 01:13:52,516
-Wimp.
-Musclehead.

821
01:13:52,766 --> 01:13:54,268
Shut up!

822
01:13:54,518 --> 01:13:58,897
I think I'll kill the dolphin first.
I wouldn't want you to miss that.

823
01:13:59,481 --> 01:14:01,275
And there's the snap.

824
01:14:01,483 --> 01:14:02,401
The kick!

825
01:14:02,651 --> 01:14:04,695
And it's good!

826
01:14:04,903 --> 01:14:07,823
Good to see somebody who
doesn't buckle under the pressure!

827
01:14:12,786 --> 01:14:17,207
What would you know about pressure?

828
01:14:17,499 --> 01:14:20,043
Well, I have kissed a man.

829
01:14:20,961 --> 01:14:25,382
Of course, there's never been
a more crucial kick in a Super Bowl...

830
01:14:25,674 --> 01:14:27,926
... than the "kick
heard around the world."

831
01:14:28,427 --> 01:14:33,473
I mean, it's clear to me that it was
a good hold. Finkle just booted it.

832
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,101
The laces were in!

833
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,187
They were in!

834
01:14:58,457 --> 01:15:00,083
You like that?

835
01:15:00,334 --> 01:15:01,502
You like that?

836
01:15:07,007 --> 01:15:08,884
And that! And that!

837
01:15:19,436 --> 01:15:21,813
Having a little trouble with the lady?

838
01:15:22,231 --> 01:15:23,690
You don't understand...

839
01:15:23,941 --> 01:15:25,108
...she's a--

840
01:15:28,153 --> 01:15:30,072
Get him, Lois! Get him!

841
01:15:33,992 --> 01:15:35,410
Get him!

842
01:15:42,084 --> 01:15:43,085
Shoot him!

843
01:15:45,170 --> 01:15:47,214
-Shoot him!
-Hold your fire!

844
01:15:49,007 --> 01:15:50,175
Don't shoot!

845
01:15:50,384 --> 01:15:52,636
Put your guns down, or this cop gets it!

846
01:15:53,428 --> 01:15:54,888
I mean it!

847
01:15:55,347 --> 01:15:57,558
She's not joking!

848
01:15:57,766 --> 01:15:59,309
He kidnapped Snowflake!

849
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:04,147
He killed Roger Podacter and was about
to kill Marino and me!

850
01:16:07,025 --> 01:16:09,486
Fiction can be fun!

851
01:16:09,778 --> 01:16:12,698
But I find the reference section
much more enlightening.

852
01:16:12,948 --> 01:16:14,324
For instance...

853
01:16:14,575 --> 01:16:15,826
...if you look up...

854
01:16:16,076 --> 01:16:20,539
...professional football's
all-time bonehead plays...

855
01:16:21,081 --> 01:16:24,501
...you might read about a Miami Dolphin
kicker named Ray Finkle...

856
01:16:24,751 --> 01:16:29,381
...who missed a 26-yard field goal
in the closing seconds of Super Bowl 17.

857
01:16:32,259 --> 01:16:36,096
You wouldn't read that Finkle
was committed to a mental hospital...

858
01:16:36,346 --> 01:16:39,641
...only to escape and join the police...

859
01:16:39,892 --> 01:16:43,103
...in a scheme
to get even with Marino...

860
01:16:43,353 --> 01:16:45,480
...whom he blamed for the entire thing!

861
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:48,692
What are you talking about?

862
01:16:48,901 --> 01:16:53,071
She's not Lois Einhorn!
She's Ray Finkle! She's a man!

863
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,364
He's lying!

864
01:16:54,615 --> 01:16:55,866
Shoot him!

865
01:16:59,077 --> 01:17:02,164
Let's just see who's lying, shall we?

866
01:17:02,414 --> 01:17:06,418
Would a real woman have to wear
one of these?

867
01:17:12,424 --> 01:17:14,510
Boy, that's really on there!

868
01:17:15,052 --> 01:17:16,762
But tell me this:

869
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:18,555
Would a real woman...

870
01:17:18,805 --> 01:17:21,016
...be missing these?

871
01:17:26,563 --> 01:17:29,358
That kind of surgery can be done
over the weekend.

872
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:31,735
But I doubt very much...

873
01:17:32,277 --> 01:17:35,948
...if he could find the time
during his busy schedule...

874
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:37,574
...to get rid of...

875
01:17:37,824 --> 01:17:38,825
...big old...

876
01:17:39,076 --> 01:17:40,702
...Mr. Knish!

877
01:17:48,627 --> 01:17:50,045
Oh, boy!

878
01:17:53,215 --> 01:17:54,299
Come here.

879
01:17:55,133 --> 01:17:57,970
Would you excuse me for just one second?

880
01:18:06,353 --> 01:18:07,980
Ladies and gentlemen...

881
01:18:08,647 --> 01:18:11,483
...my esteemed colleague, Mr. Marino...

882
01:18:12,442 --> 01:18:14,444
...brought new evidence to my attention.

883
01:18:14,695 --> 01:18:15,696
Now...

884
01:18:16,071 --> 01:18:19,908
...history has certainly shown
that even the most intuitive...

885
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:23,036
...criminal investigator can be wrong.

886
01:18:23,287 --> 01:18:25,330
But if I am mistaken...

887
01:18:25,664 --> 01:18:28,667
...if the lieutenant
is indeed a woman...

888
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:31,211
...as she claims to be...

889
01:18:31,461 --> 01:18:32,629
...then, my friend...

890
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:37,467
...she is suffering from the worst case
of hemorrhoids I have ever seen!

891
01:18:39,011 --> 01:18:41,305
That's why Roger Podacter is dead!

892
01:18:41,513 --> 01:18:43,974
He found Captain Winkie!

893
01:18:53,233 --> 01:18:54,318
Good night!

894
01:18:54,526 --> 01:18:58,071
You've been a wonderful audience.
Be sure to tip your waitress.

895
01:19:03,035 --> 01:19:05,120
Die, animal boy!

896
01:19:05,913 --> 01:19:07,247
Quick decision.

897
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:30,812
Loser!

898
01:19:37,861 --> 01:19:39,196
You have any more gum?

899
01:19:39,446 --> 01:19:43,742
That's none of your damn business.
Stay out of my personal affairs.

900
01:19:44,535 --> 01:19:47,162
You're a weird guy, Ace. A weird guy.

901
01:19:48,705 --> 01:19:51,083
Ladies and gentlemen...

902
01:19:51,291 --> 01:19:53,126
...the Miami Dolphins are proud...

903
01:19:53,335 --> 01:19:56,171
...to welcome back
to Joe Robbie Stadium...

904
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:58,048
...our beloved mascot...

905
01:19:58,257 --> 01:20:01,093
...and the star of our halftime show:

906
01:20:01,301 --> 01:20:03,053
Snowflake!

907
01:20:10,018 --> 01:20:11,645
And now...

908
01:20:11,854 --> 01:20:15,524
...returning for the second half,
the Dolphins most valuable player...

909
01:20:16,191 --> 01:20:18,402
...Dan Marino!

910
01:21:04,406 --> 01:21:05,240
Idiot!

911
01:21:06,325 --> 01:21:11,246
Do you know what you've done?
You just cost me 25 grand, Polly.

912
01:21:11,455 --> 01:21:13,457
Yeah? Blow me!

913
01:21:15,167 --> 01:21:16,502
Really?

914
01:21:31,892 --> 01:21:33,477
The National Football League...

915
01:21:33,685 --> 01:21:38,440
...would like to offer a special thank-
you to the man who rescued Dan Marino...

916
01:21:38,649 --> 01:21:40,108
...and our beloved Snowflake.

917
01:21:40,692 --> 01:21:42,319
A great humanitarian...

918
01:21:42,569 --> 01:21:44,655
...and a lover of all animals:

919
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:48,033
Mr. Ace Ventura!

920
01:21:50,035 --> 01:21:51,537
Get off me!

921
01:21:52,871 --> 01:21:54,498
Get off me!

922
01:21:58,752 --> 01:22:03,882
Tone, put that big-ass size 13 on
and kick it for the homies.

923
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:39,681
