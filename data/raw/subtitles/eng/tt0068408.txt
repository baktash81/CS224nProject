1
00:03:01,156 --> 00:03:02,573
Come, come.

2
00:03:08,663 --> 00:03:10,706
Are you authorized
to dress him like that?

3
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,583
Oh, yes, sir.

4
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:17,671
- A circus ape, huh?
- The only one to have been trained

5
00:03:17,755 --> 00:03:21,675
as a bareback rider
in the entire history of the circus.

6
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:24,511
- Circuses are past history.
- Not while I live and breathe.

7
00:03:24,596 --> 00:03:27,681
- All right, Señor Armando. Go ahead.
- Thank you.

8
00:03:27,765 --> 00:03:29,765
Come, come.

9
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:57,336
- Did I do all right?
- Yes, yes, yes.

10
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,047
But try to walk a little more
like a primitive chimpanzee.

11
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:05,385
Your arms should move
up and down from the shoulder... like so.

12
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,804
Yes, that's better.

13
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:11,850
After 20 years, you've picked up
evolved habits from me.

14
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:15,687
That could be dangerous. Even fatal.

15
00:04:15,772 --> 00:04:18,732
- Armando, I don't understand.
- Listen to me, Caesar.

16
00:04:18,816 --> 00:04:21,401
There can be only
one talking chimpanzee on Earth.

17
00:04:21,486 --> 00:04:24,821
The child of the two talking apes,
Cornelius and Zira,

18
00:04:24,906 --> 00:04:27,074
who came to us years ago
out of the future

19
00:04:27,158 --> 00:04:28,909
and were murdered for fear

20
00:04:28,993 --> 00:04:33,121
that one distant day
apes might dominate the human race.

21
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:36,166
Yeah, but outside of you,
nobody even knows I exist.

22
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:38,919
And we must keep it that way,
for the fear remains.

23
00:04:39,003 --> 00:04:44,424
The mere fact of your existence would be
regarded as a great threat to mankind.

24
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:45,842
Come. Come.

25
00:05:03,861 --> 00:05:05,821
Attention, this is the watch commander.

26
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:09,074
Disperse apes gathering in the mall.

27
00:05:09,158 --> 00:05:13,245
Repeat: disperse apes
gathering in the mall.

28
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:17,708
Take the serial number of each offender
and notify Ape Control immediately.

29
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:20,752
Repeat: take the serial number
of each offender

30
00:05:20,837 --> 00:05:23,839
and notify Ape Control immediately.

31
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:26,341
Their masters are to be cited and fined.

32
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:30,512
Repeat: their masters
are to be cited and fined.

33
00:06:18,936 --> 00:06:22,272
Attention. Attention.
This is the watch commander.

34
00:06:22,357 --> 00:06:23,857
Attention. Attention.

35
00:06:23,941 --> 00:06:28,320
Disperse unauthorized ape gathering
at the foot of ramp six.

36
00:06:28,404 --> 00:06:33,909
Repeat: disperse unauthorized
ape gathering at the foot of ramp six.

37
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:36,495
No citation or fine in this instance.

38
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:39,414
Repeat: no citation or fine in this...

39
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,666
But how did it happen?

40
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:52,511
Go! Go!

41
00:06:52,595 --> 00:06:55,472
No! No!

42
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:06,817
Go! You go!

43
00:07:12,323 --> 00:07:16,410
But you said humans treated apes
like pets.

44
00:07:16,494 --> 00:07:20,330
- They did, in the beginning.
- They've made slaves of them!

45
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,675
They all died within a few months,
eight years ago.

46
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,137
Every dog and cat in the world.
It was like a plague.

47
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:39,683
The disease that killed them was a virus
brought back from space by an astronaut.

48
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:42,686
- Didn't the disease affect humans?
- We were immune.

49
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,356
And so, it was discovered, were simians,
even the smallest ones.

50
00:07:46,441 --> 00:07:48,150
That's how it began.

51
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:52,279
Humans wanting little household pets
to replace the ones they had lost.

52
00:07:52,363 --> 00:07:57,951
Then, when people realized how quick
they were to learn, how easy to train,

53
00:07:58,035 --> 00:08:04,541
the pets became larger,
and larger, until now...

54
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,376
It's monstrous.

55
00:08:10,298 --> 00:08:13,633
Now you understand
why I've kept you away.

56
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,344
Yes, Lisa.

57
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,889
A Young Queen Falls for Mrs Riley.

58
00:08:34,864 --> 00:08:35,906
No!

59
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,414
Lisa.

60
00:08:47,043 --> 00:08:49,169
Yes?

61
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:52,881
Could you possibly be so kind
as to display it in your window?

62
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,467
- When I have the time.
- Thank you.

63
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:04,476
The labor demonstration
on the South Plaza

64
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,354
will be terminated in ten minutes.

65
00:09:07,438 --> 00:09:11,358
Repeat: the labor demonstration
on the South Plaza

66
00:09:11,442 --> 00:09:13,902
will be terminated in ten minutes.

67
00:09:22,537 --> 00:09:24,162
Thank you, Frank.

68
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:31,044
Funny. Now that I know they
won't kill me, I don't enjoy them.

69
00:09:34,966 --> 00:09:37,467
Well, for heaven's sakes! A circus!

70
00:10:11,002 --> 00:10:12,502
Home, Lisa.

71
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,100
- Yes?
- Oh, I was wondering,

72
00:10:27,184 --> 00:10:31,313
would you be kind enough
to display a couple of these posters?

73
00:10:33,274 --> 00:10:36,109
- Stop it!
- No, Zelda! No!

74
00:10:36,193 --> 00:10:38,695
Home, Zelda.

75
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:42,490
I'm so sorry, Mrs Riley. I'll have
someone to comb you out in a minute.

76
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,035
I wanna be combed out now.
I have a luncheon.

77
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:47,829
- Thursday, then.
- Thursday.

78
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,957
I... I forgot the waiter
and I'm all out of raisins.

79
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:53,084
- Take mine.
- Thank you.

80
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,256
You're overtipping.

81
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:03,887
No! No! No!

82
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:08,224
And I told them to condition him to fire.

83
00:11:13,731 --> 00:11:17,400
Attention. The labor demonstration
on the South Plaza

84
00:11:17,818 --> 00:11:19,778
will be terminated in five minutes.

85
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:23,156
Repeat: the labor demonstration
on the South Plaza

86
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,867
will be terminated in five minutes.

87
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,952
Failure to comply with this order

88
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:33,333
can result in a one-year suspension
of your right to bargain collectively.

89
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:35,502
- What's his job?
- He's a messenger.

90
00:11:35,586 --> 00:11:37,837
For the governor, so get!

91
00:11:41,717 --> 00:11:43,343
No! No! No!

92
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:54,771
- Stop that at once! All of you!
- Yes, sir, Mr MacDonald. We were just...

93
00:11:54,855 --> 00:11:58,650
I saw what you were doing. Now sedate
the animal and get him out of here.

94
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:03,154
- Who the hell's that?
- The governor's number-one assistant.

95
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:06,408
- He love apes or something?
- Don't it figure?

96
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:09,744
Hold him.

97
00:12:12,206 --> 00:12:14,124
Lousy human bastards!

98
00:12:21,298 --> 00:12:22,882
Who said that?

99
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:25,343
I did.

100
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,556
He's a performing ape for my circus.

101
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,225
- A talking ape?
- No! No, no.

102
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:34,519
No, that's impossible.
It was I who spoke.

103
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:36,646
It didn't sound like your voice.

104
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:39,733
Yell "Lousy human bastards."

105
00:12:39,817 --> 00:12:42,235
- That's not what I said.
- That's what I heard.

106
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:45,572
Now, look, mister,
you yell "Lousy human bastards."

107
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:50,285
- Lousy human bastards.
- We said yell!

108
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,912
Lousy human bastards!

109
00:12:52,997 --> 00:12:55,290
- Yeah, yeah. Could be.
- I don't think so.

110
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,959
- It's right. The ape spoke.
- Yeah!

111
00:12:58,127 --> 00:12:59,669
No! No, they're mistaken.

112
00:12:59,754 --> 00:13:03,590
I admit my behavior was inexcusable
and I am deeply sorry.

113
00:13:03,674 --> 00:13:06,926
I think we better take him
to headquarters for interrogation.

114
00:13:07,011 --> 00:13:08,344
Guard!

115
00:13:32,203 --> 00:13:33,578
Move him on.

116
00:13:41,545 --> 00:13:44,798
- Armando, forgive me.
- Oh, no, no.

117
00:13:44,882 --> 00:13:47,801
You only said aloud what I was thinking.

118
00:13:47,885 --> 00:13:51,221
I'm sorry. I was so angry.

119
00:13:51,305 --> 00:13:54,307
I might have bluffed it through
if you hadn't run away.

120
00:13:54,391 --> 00:13:57,393
Now they suspect you
of understanding all that was said.

121
00:13:57,478 --> 00:14:02,982
- Armando, let's go back to the circus.
- No, no, no.

122
00:14:03,067 --> 00:14:06,820
- Oh, no, please.
- No, that's the first place they'll look.

123
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:28,174
Here's what we'll do. I'll go to the police.

124
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:31,010
- Oh, no, no!
- It's the only way!

125
00:14:31,095 --> 00:14:35,223
I'll say that... that I couldn't find you.

126
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:38,059
That... you've run away before.

127
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:41,563
- That big cities frighten you.
- But, Armando, where would I go?

128
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,983
You wait right here!
If this works, I'll be back by nightfall.

129
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:49,529
- But what if they don't let you go?
- Oh, they will. They will.

130
00:14:51,907 --> 00:14:55,577
But just in case, if I am not back by then...

131
00:14:55,661 --> 00:15:00,081
Now, these steps go down
to a tunnel that leads to the harbor.

132
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:03,126
Cargoes of apes are frequently
unloaded at night.

133
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,296
- You must try to infiltrate one of them.
- But, Armando...

134
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,340
Apes imported from overseas
arrive naked,

135
00:15:09,425 --> 00:15:10,884
so you'll have to get rid of these clothes.

136
00:15:10,968 --> 00:15:14,596
- Well, I don't want to.
- We must have an alternate plan!

137
00:15:17,474 --> 00:15:21,477
Right now, the only safe
hiding place for you

138
00:15:21,562 --> 00:15:23,479
is among your own kind.

139
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,038
I shouldn't be long.

140
00:15:53,844 --> 00:15:55,678
Why would you say "human"?

141
00:15:55,763 --> 00:15:58,973
"Human." That's a very odd thing
for another human being to say.

142
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:02,602
I didn't say "human," Mr Governor.
I said "inhuman."

143
00:16:02,686 --> 00:16:04,854
Lousy inhuman bastards.

144
00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:08,441
And by the blessed St Francis,
who loved all animals, I meant it.

145
00:16:08,525 --> 00:16:11,110
- You see, I run a circus...
- We know that.

146
00:16:11,195 --> 00:16:16,282
- From 20 years back.
- Since the talking apes arrived on Earth

147
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:18,743
and conceived a baby whose
survival could have threatened

148
00:16:18,827 --> 00:16:20,912
the future of the human race.

149
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:24,916
Mr Governor, I understand
the baby was shot dead with its parents.

150
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,044
Or so it was believed, Mr MacDonald.

151
00:16:28,128 --> 00:16:30,088
However, since this morning,

152
00:16:30,172 --> 00:16:32,632
I'm beginning to wonder
if they shot the right baby.

153
00:16:32,716 --> 00:16:36,094
The apes could have switched
their baby with one from the zoo.

154
00:16:36,178 --> 00:16:37,971
Or perhaps a circus.

155
00:16:38,055 --> 00:16:41,516
Surely, Mr Governor, you can't be serious!

156
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,851
Hoskyns, the cassette, please.

157
00:16:46,855 --> 00:16:51,484
These are the recommendations made to
the then president of the United States

158
00:16:51,568 --> 00:16:54,737
by the chairman
of the Presidential Committee.

159
00:16:58,409 --> 00:17:03,246
And we believe that the male and female
talking apes, Cornelius and Zira,

160
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,999
have come to us out of the future.

161
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:10,128
We believe their spoken testimony,
that some 2,000 years hence,

162
00:17:10,212 --> 00:17:14,757
their descendants will have all but
exterminated the human race from Earth.

163
00:17:14,842 --> 00:17:19,095
And we know that the female ape
is now pregnant with child.

164
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:21,723
The commission therefore recommends

165
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:26,602
that the birth of the female ape's
unborn child should be prevented

166
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:30,023
and that both the male and the female

167
00:17:30,107 --> 00:17:33,317
should be rendered
incapable of begetting another.

168
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:42,618
But, Mr Governor, every zoo, public
and private, was searched by the police,

169
00:17:42,703 --> 00:17:44,787
and every circus, including my own.

170
00:17:44,872 --> 00:17:49,584
- But a small chimpanzee was found.
- The only one ever to be born in a circus,

171
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,879
and legally certified
to have been born a month -

172
00:17:52,963 --> 00:17:57,050
a month - before the talking apes
arrived on earth.

173
00:17:57,134 --> 00:18:00,595
- Where is he now?
- I wish I knew. I've searched everywhere.

174
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,014
Señor Armando!

175
00:18:03,098 --> 00:18:05,725
Let me remind you...

176
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:08,269
of the seriousness of our problem.

177
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,314
Now.

178
00:18:11,398 --> 00:18:14,984
Your circus travels mainly
in the provinces?

179
00:18:15,069 --> 00:18:16,069
Yes, sir.

180
00:18:16,153 --> 00:18:20,573
Then, undoubtedly, you are unaware
of the rising tide of disobedience,

181
00:18:20,657 --> 00:18:25,078
the outright defiance, among
the servant apes in our cities.

182
00:18:25,162 --> 00:18:29,707
Mr Governor, on investigation, many
of the offenses have been proved minor.

183
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:33,169
The ape killed while trying
to escape from the city last night,

184
00:18:33,253 --> 00:18:36,839
- would you call his offense minor?
- No, sir, I would not.

185
00:18:36,924 --> 00:18:39,592
He physically assaulted his own master.

186
00:18:39,676 --> 00:18:42,386
But only after what must have
been severe provocation.

187
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:46,641
The ape's body was covered with
welts and bruises inflicted by a beating.

188
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,185
Which he no doubt richly deserved.

189
00:18:50,437 --> 00:18:53,773
How many more of them out there
are just like that ape?

190
00:18:53,857 --> 00:18:56,776
All burning with resentment.

191
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,238
Or waiting. Waiting for an ape
with enough intelligence,

192
00:19:00,322 --> 00:19:02,740
with enough will, to lead them.

193
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:07,286
Waiting for an ape who can think.
Who can talk.

194
00:19:10,124 --> 00:19:12,792
Señor Armando,

195
00:19:12,876 --> 00:19:17,630
has your ape ever talked or shown any
signs of being articulate in your presence?

196
00:19:17,714 --> 00:19:20,800
Never in my presence, or anyone else's.

197
00:19:20,884 --> 00:19:23,094
You can question my circus hands.

198
00:19:23,178 --> 00:19:25,138
We intend to.

199
00:19:25,222 --> 00:19:27,849
Meanwhile, you will remain in custody.

200
00:21:00,776 --> 00:21:05,029
Shipment 507, I for Indonesia, ex-Borneo,

201
00:21:05,113 --> 00:21:08,157
now arriving at gate number two.

202
00:21:12,913 --> 00:21:18,626
Shipment 509, A for Africa,
ex-French Cameroons,

203
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,337
now arriving at number four gate.

204
00:21:22,631 --> 00:21:27,802
After fingerprinting, shipment 507,
I for Indonesia, ex-Borneo,

205
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:31,639
will proceed direct
to conditioning cage 90.

206
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:36,978
After fingerprinting, shipment 507,
I for Indonesia, ex-Borneo,

207
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:40,856
will proceed direct
to conditioning cage 90.

208
00:21:40,941 --> 00:21:44,777
Immigration personnel are reminded
that, until further notice,

209
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:47,863
police have requested one additional copy

210
00:21:47,948 --> 00:21:50,783
of all chimpanzee fingerprints
for their files.

211
00:21:50,867 --> 00:21:55,288
Repeat: immigration personnel are
reminded that until further notice,

212
00:21:55,372 --> 00:21:58,207
police have requested one additional copy

213
00:21:58,292 --> 00:22:00,960
of all chimpanzee fingerprints
for their files.

214
00:22:44,588 --> 00:22:45,713
Do!

215
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:21,457
Next!

216
00:23:32,803 --> 00:23:43,145
No!

217
00:24:07,462 --> 00:24:09,422
They're a bit uppity.
I haven't fed them yet.

218
00:24:09,506 --> 00:24:12,383
Come on!

219
00:24:12,467 --> 00:24:13,843
Switch off.

220
00:24:22,477 --> 00:24:23,811
Switch on.

221
00:25:19,326 --> 00:25:21,577
Have you seen this ape before?

222
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:26,165
Isn't it... Cornelius?

223
00:25:26,249 --> 00:25:28,375
I thought you didn't know him?

224
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,505
B-But you told me yourself.
T-The talking ape that was murdered...

225
00:25:32,589 --> 00:25:35,257
- Executed.
- Executed.

226
00:25:35,342 --> 00:25:37,927
- Would you say there's a resemblance?
- Oh, no.

227
00:25:38,011 --> 00:25:40,679
Look very carefully.

228
00:25:40,764 --> 00:25:45,184
- Like father, like son, eh?
- No. No!

229
00:25:45,268 --> 00:25:48,437
You'd do well to cooperate with us.

230
00:25:48,522 --> 00:25:52,608
l-I... Could I...
Could I please have a glass of water?

231
00:26:54,671 --> 00:26:55,796
Do.

232
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,264
No!

233
00:27:05,348 --> 00:27:06,473
Do.

234
00:27:28,705 --> 00:27:42,009
No! No!

235
00:27:51,561 --> 00:27:52,603
Do.

236
00:28:05,492 --> 00:28:07,660
Attention. Training Control.

237
00:28:07,744 --> 00:28:10,204
Four females have arrived
for insemination -

238
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,331
three gorillas and one chimpanzee.

239
00:28:12,415 --> 00:28:14,416
Please select four superior males -

240
00:28:14,501 --> 00:28:19,380
three gorillas, one chimpanzee - and send
them to the breeding annex immediately.

241
00:29:08,888 --> 00:29:10,889
254 process for auction.

242
00:29:10,974 --> 00:29:13,058
Yes, ma"am, for immediate sale.

243
00:29:13,143 --> 00:29:18,021
One male gorilla, age seven.
Fully conditioned bedmaker, grade A.

244
00:29:18,106 --> 00:29:21,483
Yes, yes.
You will be credited after auction.

245
00:30:01,191 --> 00:30:03,108
So you're a member of Breck's party.

246
00:30:03,193 --> 00:30:05,402
Now I understand
how you got those big contracts.

247
00:30:05,487 --> 00:30:08,280
He's good for this country.
Good for all of us.

248
00:30:08,364 --> 00:30:09,907
You really think he's gonna make it?

249
00:30:09,991 --> 00:30:12,743
I don't know of anyone
who could stop him.

250
00:30:12,827 --> 00:30:14,536
Bring up lot eight!

251
00:30:16,289 --> 00:30:20,042
Lot eight! One male chimpanzee!

252
00:30:20,126 --> 00:30:23,796
In early prime
and perfect physical condition.

253
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,548
Take a good look at this specimen.

254
00:30:26,633 --> 00:30:29,510
This has to be the buy of the afternoon.

255
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:33,055
Early prime. Perfect physical condition.

256
00:30:33,139 --> 00:30:36,809
Under observation, he appeared
so familiar, obedient, docile

257
00:30:36,893 --> 00:30:38,811
and intelligent with humans

258
00:30:38,895 --> 00:30:42,314
that conditioning
was not considered necessary.

259
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:46,819
But it certainly can be provided
on request.

260
00:30:46,903 --> 00:30:51,824
We're gonna start the bidding
on this specimen at $800.

261
00:30:51,908 --> 00:30:55,619
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
what am I bid on this superb specimen?

262
00:30:55,703 --> 00:30:59,164
Bidding starts at 800. 800.

263
00:30:59,249 --> 00:31:02,626
What am I bid for this superb specimen?

264
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:03,752
800. 800.

265
00:31:03,837 --> 00:31:06,922
- 850!
- 850 over here. Do I hear nine?

266
00:31:07,006 --> 00:31:09,675
- 900!
- I hear nine over there! Nine over there!

267
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:12,010
- 950.
- 950 over there on the end.

268
00:31:12,095 --> 00:31:13,595
- 1,000.
- 1,000 from the gentleman

269
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,473
on the end. $1,000.

270
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:18,433
- 1100!
- 1100 over here.

271
00:31:18,518 --> 00:31:20,143
- 1150.
- 1150 in the back row.

272
00:31:20,228 --> 00:31:23,021
- 1200
- $1200 from this gentleman.

273
00:31:23,106 --> 00:31:25,899
Going to this gentleman. Going! Going...

274
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,526
- Buy him.
- 1500!

275
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,695
1500 from Mr MacDonald!

276
00:31:29,779 --> 00:31:32,948
For His Excellency, Governor Breck.

277
00:31:33,032 --> 00:31:35,742
Going! Going!

278
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:36,827
Gone!

279
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:42,291
Come.

280
00:31:45,628 --> 00:31:50,382
It's very good, Morgan, but simplify
the wording in that last paragraph.

281
00:31:50,466 --> 00:31:54,428
Sir, we've received a disappointing
report on the automated sanitation plan.

282
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:58,557
- You have a meeting with Curfew Control.
- Cancel it, Miss Greer.

283
00:31:58,641 --> 00:32:01,018
These figures, did you double-check them?

284
00:32:01,102 --> 00:32:03,395
- Yes, sir.
- Triple-check them!

285
00:32:03,479 --> 00:32:07,232
- Come.
- Hold all calls, Miss Greer.

286
00:32:07,317 --> 00:32:10,736
Here's the IQ profile on all apes
tested within the last four weeks.

287
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,529
It's risen by 32/3 points.

288
00:32:12,614 --> 00:32:15,949
Uh-huh! Show Mr MacDonald.
He thinks I'm imagining things.

289
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,577
I assembled that.
You summarized the wrong part.

290
00:32:18,661 --> 00:32:21,788
So their output has increased
about the same percentage,

291
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:25,250
which I thought the governor
might regard as good news.

292
00:32:25,335 --> 00:32:28,170
It's all right. We'll go over that later.

293
00:32:32,258 --> 00:32:33,342
No.

294
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,179
Watch.

295
00:32:56,532 --> 00:32:57,699
Do.

296
00:33:17,387 --> 00:33:21,473
No, no, no. Clean. Clean.

297
00:33:21,557 --> 00:33:23,892
It seems the little fella's
not so bright after all.

298
00:33:23,977 --> 00:33:27,312
No. But brightness has never
been encouraged amongst slaves.

299
00:33:27,397 --> 00:33:30,691
Oh, don't be so touchy, Mr MacDonald.

300
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:34,361
All of us were slaves once,
in one sense of the word or another.

301
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:37,906
If you feel the ape's unsatisfactory,
we can have him reconditioned.

302
00:33:37,991 --> 00:33:41,284
- That isn't necessary.
- You're quite right, Mr MacDonald.

303
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:44,579
But not for any
of your bleeding-heart reasons.

304
00:33:44,664 --> 00:33:47,916
Reconditioning. That's all
any of you ever think of, isn't it?

305
00:33:48,001 --> 00:33:52,462
Don't you realize, if we were to take
every ape who disobeyed an order

306
00:33:52,547 --> 00:33:57,009
and sent him back for reconditioning, Ape
Management would become overcrowded.

307
00:33:57,093 --> 00:34:01,138
- It's the only thing that has any effect.
- Just makes them worse.

308
00:34:01,222 --> 00:34:03,473
Some of them couldn't be worse.

309
00:34:03,558 --> 00:34:05,851
I've been having
a comprehensive list compiled.

310
00:34:05,935 --> 00:34:08,520
- Mr Governor.
- Yes, what is it you want?

311
00:34:08,604 --> 00:34:10,856
It's your meeting
with the Defense Council.

312
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,566
I'll be along in a moment.

313
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,360
- Defense Council?
- I'll tell you about it later.

314
00:34:15,445 --> 00:34:17,195
Is this related to the list you mentioned?

315
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,407
You'll be given full details, Mr MacDonald.

316
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,951
Meanwhile, we're going
to set a good example

317
00:34:23,036 --> 00:34:25,412
and recondition this fella ourselves.

318
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:28,707
- We haven't named him yet, have we?
- No, Mr Breck.

319
00:34:28,791 --> 00:34:31,001
I'm going to revive a charming tradition

320
00:34:31,085 --> 00:34:33,712
established in her lifetime
by my dear wife,

321
00:34:33,796 --> 00:34:35,797
and let you name yourself.

322
00:35:08,831 --> 00:35:13,043
'Caesar.' A king.

323
00:35:19,842 --> 00:35:20,926
Yes?

324
00:35:23,179 --> 00:35:26,389
They're waiting for you
in the council chamber.

325
00:35:28,017 --> 00:35:31,478
I don't think we'll ever make
a bartender out of Caesar.

326
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:33,355
Have him detailed to the Command Post.

327
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:06,304
No!

328
00:36:19,152 --> 00:36:20,402
Attention.

329
00:36:20,486 --> 00:36:25,115
There is a report of unescorted apes
in the Plaza. Investigate.

330
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:36,918
Can I help you, Mr MacDonald?

331
00:36:37,003 --> 00:36:39,671
This ape's assigned to the Command Post.

332
00:36:39,755 --> 00:36:41,798
- What's his name, sir?
- Caesar.

333
00:36:41,883 --> 00:36:44,426
Start him off in the files.
Low-priority traffic.

334
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,886
Yes, sir.

335
00:36:49,432 --> 00:36:50,432
Do!

336
00:36:53,936 --> 00:36:56,938
Lisa. Lisa!

337
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:11,995
Ah! Señor Armando!

338
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,415
- This way, señor. This way.
- Sit down, sit down.

339
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:17,542
We have good news for you.

340
00:37:19,754 --> 00:37:23,632
- Good news?
- Yes. You're to be released.

341
00:37:23,716 --> 00:37:26,218
Inspector Hoskyns and I believe
that your ape

342
00:37:26,302 --> 00:37:29,596
is not the child
of the talking chimpanzees.

343
00:37:33,434 --> 00:37:37,229
- You found him?
- Not yet, but he'll turn up sooner or later.

344
00:37:37,313 --> 00:37:40,482
I'm sorry for the inconvenience
we had to cause you.

345
00:37:40,566 --> 00:37:42,901
Do forgive us, but it was unavoidable.

346
00:37:42,985 --> 00:37:44,444
Oh, yes. Yes.

347
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,324
Then I'm... I'm free to go?

348
00:37:49,408 --> 00:37:52,494
Oh, as soon as you sign
this sworn declaration.

349
00:37:55,581 --> 00:37:56,581
What does it say?

350
00:37:56,666 --> 00:37:58,792
Only what you've been telling us all along.

351
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:01,795
The circus ape
is incapable of human speech and,

352
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:04,589
to the best of your knowledge,
he's never uttered a word.

353
00:38:04,674 --> 00:38:06,675
Certainly.

354
00:38:06,759 --> 00:38:13,098
Excellent. Now we'll check this with the
authenticator, then you'll be free to go.

355
00:38:13,182 --> 00:38:16,268
The... authenticator?

356
00:38:16,352 --> 00:38:20,689
It's just a formality. Sit back down,
please. It'll just take a moment.

357
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:38,331
What does the authenticator do?

358
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:42,002
Makes people tell the truth.
It's quite painless.

359
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:45,630
For example, you said you first
heard the name Cornelius in this office.

360
00:38:45,715 --> 00:38:47,299
Was that true?

361
00:38:58,311 --> 00:39:02,814
- No.
- Now, there! You see?

362
00:39:02,898 --> 00:39:05,025
That's not a bad black mark against you.

363
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:08,069
You probably heard it
somewhere else before.

364
00:39:08,154 --> 00:39:13,158
Now. About your statement,
sworn statement,

365
00:39:13,242 --> 00:39:16,494
that the circus ape is incapable of speech.

366
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:19,664
- No. I won't submit to this.
- You will, Señor Armando!

367
00:39:19,749 --> 00:39:24,002
I have done nothing wrong!
You are treating me like a criminal!

368
00:39:24,086 --> 00:39:25,712
Sit back, please.

369
00:39:27,006 --> 00:39:28,840
No! No, no.

370
00:39:28,924 --> 00:39:30,842
- Guard!
- No!

371
00:39:30,926 --> 00:39:31,926
No!

372
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,197
I knew that circus owner was lying.

373
00:39:52,281 --> 00:39:54,366
They insist he
fell to his death accidentally.

374
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:57,660
While trying to escape!
He knew he'd been exposed.

375
00:41:26,208 --> 00:41:28,668
Attention. Attention.

376
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:33,214
Last night, several security forces
apprehended and placed in custody

377
00:41:33,299 --> 00:41:38,303
a number of servant apes from widely
scattered households throughout the city,

378
00:41:38,387 --> 00:41:41,639
who had gathered clandestinely
in the unused building

379
00:41:41,724 --> 00:41:44,767
on the outskirts of the East Sector.

380
00:41:44,852 --> 00:41:49,063
Property owners are firmly warned
that they bear sole responsibility

381
00:41:49,148 --> 00:41:52,567
for the behavior
and whereabouts of their servant apes.

382
00:42:45,579 --> 00:42:46,746
Frank!

383
00:42:52,795 --> 00:42:53,962
Frank.

384
00:43:00,469 --> 00:43:01,636
No!

385
00:43:25,494 --> 00:43:30,248
"One dozen steaks, New York cut,
for Mrs Van Thal."

386
00:43:33,252 --> 00:43:36,879
Add one gallon of... No.

387
00:43:36,964 --> 00:43:41,259
Two gallons

388
00:43:41,343 --> 00:43:44,304
of kerosene.

389
00:43:57,401 --> 00:44:00,278
Mr Governor.
The latest ape-disobedience figures.

390
00:44:00,362 --> 00:44:02,780
There's been a marked increase
in property damage.

391
00:44:02,865 --> 00:44:05,783
Couldn't all be carelessness,
Mr MacDonald!

392
00:44:05,868 --> 00:44:08,536
Arrange for distribution of the Achilles list.

393
00:44:08,621 --> 00:44:14,125
Copies to each police precinct. Details are
to be left to the individual commanders,

394
00:44:14,209 --> 00:44:16,461
but I want every ape on that list

395
00:44:16,545 --> 00:44:20,840
delivered to the reconditioning center
by 0600 tomorrow morning.

396
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:23,468
I'm sorry, 309. The cages are full.

397
00:44:23,552 --> 00:44:27,305
We cannot accommodate any new intakes
until after Tuesday's auction.

398
00:44:36,565 --> 00:44:41,653
"Collect one repaired Colt 45."

399
00:44:41,737 --> 00:44:43,905
And...

400
00:44:43,989 --> 00:44:49,452
100 rounds ammunition.

401
00:44:55,834 --> 00:45:00,380
The Achilles list, Mr MacDonald,
referring to our Achilles heel,

402
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:02,882
contains the name of every ape
who, over the past year,

403
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:05,677
has been overtly disobedient.

404
00:45:05,761 --> 00:45:08,388
The charge against them is nonsense.

405
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:10,640
It will do for my purposes.

406
00:45:10,766 --> 00:45:13,017
They constitute
the hard core of our problem

407
00:45:13,102 --> 00:45:15,186
and I'm going to crush them
once and for all!

408
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:18,189
Sir, you will only further
aggravate the problem.

409
00:45:18,273 --> 00:45:24,278
This action is folly, and I wish to protest
it in the strongest possible terms.

410
00:45:24,363 --> 00:45:26,322
Very well, Mr MacDonald.

411
00:45:26,407 --> 00:45:29,575
Your protest has been duly noted.

412
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:34,288
From now on, you have but
one assignment: to find that talking ape.

413
00:45:49,221 --> 00:45:53,224
- What is this? A red alert?
- Sort of.

414
00:45:53,308 --> 00:45:56,853
Ape Management computer's
come up with an intriguing error.

415
00:45:56,937 --> 00:46:02,984
Shipment 507, I for Indonesia, comprised
three orangutans and one chimpanzee.

416
00:46:03,068 --> 00:46:07,405
- So?
- There are no chimpanzees in Borneo.

417
00:46:07,489 --> 00:46:08,823
Yes, sir.

418
00:46:08,907 --> 00:46:12,744
State Security Chief
Inspector Kolp on line three.

419
00:46:12,828 --> 00:46:14,912
Yes, Inspector.

420
00:46:14,997 --> 00:46:18,541
Give me the Indonesia file for last month.

421
00:46:18,625 --> 00:46:24,005
That's 507, ex-Borneo.
Right, Inspector. Let me check.

422
00:46:24,089 --> 00:46:29,177
507, ex-Borneo. Yes, sir. That
chimpanzee was sold to Governor Breck.

423
00:46:29,511 --> 00:46:31,929
Good God! Just as I first thought.

424
00:46:32,014 --> 00:46:34,515
We've had him under our noses
all the time!

425
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:38,770
Sir, I'm willing to have the ape executed
immediately on your verbal orders alone.

426
00:46:38,854 --> 00:46:41,397
- You'll have it in writing.
- Thank you, sir.

427
00:46:41,482 --> 00:46:43,816
Get Mr MacDonald at the Command Post.

428
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:46,277
However, suppose he can speak
but won't?

429
00:46:46,361 --> 00:46:47,945
I don't understand.

430
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:51,783
The chief inspector means
there'd still be a doubt.

431
00:46:51,867 --> 00:46:54,535
If the chimpanzee keeps his mouth shut,
the case stays open.

432
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,496
We'd like to close the file.

433
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,873
You shall. I promise you.

434
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:03,211
Reconditioning applications
have to be made out in triplicate.

435
00:47:06,715 --> 00:47:10,718
MacDonald speaking. Yes, sir.

436
00:47:10,803 --> 00:47:13,971
You want me to turn Caesar
over to Inspector Kolp?

437
00:47:14,056 --> 00:47:16,599
Is he on your Achilles list?

438
00:47:16,683 --> 00:47:20,394
Mr MacDonald, do not question an order.

439
00:47:20,479 --> 00:47:25,650
No, sir, I'm not questioning
the order. It's just that...

440
00:47:25,734 --> 00:47:30,363
Well, I sent him out on an errand.
He should be back momentarily.

441
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:33,115
Yes, sir. I'll do just as you say.

442
00:47:48,215 --> 00:47:49,423
Come.

443
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:03,521
- No, this goes to Traffic Control!
- Take it easy. They can't read.

444
00:48:03,605 --> 00:48:05,481
Not yet, they can't.

445
00:48:09,278 --> 00:48:10,444
Do.

446
00:48:13,365 --> 00:48:16,450
Mr MacDonald, are you near a phone?

447
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:24,292
Mr MacDonald, it is imperative
that you get to a phone!

448
00:48:26,461 --> 00:48:29,881
Come in, Mr MacDonald! Do you hear me?

449
00:48:29,965 --> 00:48:34,218
Get to a phone and come in!

450
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,803
Now, come in!

451
00:48:39,558 --> 00:48:43,060
- Yes, Mr Governor.
- Kolp is on his way down with the police.

452
00:48:43,145 --> 00:48:46,522
- Is Caesar back yet?
- Not yet, sir. I'll keep a look out.

453
00:48:46,607 --> 00:48:50,443
Notify me the moment
he's handed over to them.

454
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:51,819
Yes, sir.

455
00:49:09,338 --> 00:49:12,173
I wish...

456
00:49:12,257 --> 00:49:16,928
I wish there was some way we could
communicate, so you'd understand that I...

457
00:49:20,474 --> 00:49:23,643
I understand,

458
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:25,186
Mr MacDonald.

459
00:49:32,611 --> 00:49:36,697
Yes, I... I'm the one they're looking for.

460
00:49:47,793 --> 00:49:51,545
I never believed it.
I... I thought you were a myth.

461
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:55,174
Well, I'm not.

462
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:58,010
But I will tell you something that is.

463
00:49:58,095 --> 00:50:00,930
The belief that human beings are kind...

464
00:50:01,014 --> 00:50:03,057
No, Caesar. There are some...

465
00:50:03,141 --> 00:50:05,393
A handful, perhaps, but not most of them.

466
00:50:05,477 --> 00:50:09,563
They won't learn to be kind
until we force them to.

467
00:50:09,648 --> 00:50:13,150
We can't do that until we are free.

468
00:50:13,235 --> 00:50:17,238
How do you propose to gain this freedom?

469
00:50:17,322 --> 00:50:21,033
By the only means left to us.

470
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:24,996
- Revolution.
- But... it's doomed to failure!

471
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,707
Perhaps... this time.

472
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:30,209
- And the next.
- Maybe.

473
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:33,879
- But you'll keep trying.
- You, above everyone else,

474
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:36,590
should understand.

475
00:50:36,675 --> 00:50:40,386
We cannot be free until we have power.

476
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,596
How else can we achieve it?

477
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:54,358
Go.

478
00:51:06,621 --> 00:51:11,709
Ah, Mr MacDonald, I have an order from
the governor to take Caesar into custody.

479
00:51:11,793 --> 00:51:13,878
I know. I've been looking for him.

480
00:51:13,962 --> 00:51:16,464
- He's not in the Command Post?
- No.

481
00:51:16,548 --> 00:51:19,759
Issue an order to round up
all unaccompanied apes.

482
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:13,414
I still don't see why he made a run for it.

483
00:53:13,498 --> 00:53:17,668
It's really quite simple, Mr MacDonald.
The ape has intelligence.

484
00:53:17,752 --> 00:53:20,713
He knew that his friend Armando
was dead.

485
00:53:20,839 --> 00:53:23,966
He assumed the man first
betrayed him under torture.

486
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:26,468
But we don't do that... to humans.

487
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:34,727
Now.

488
00:53:43,820 --> 00:54:23,317
Talk!

489
00:54:49,344 --> 00:54:52,096
Have...

490
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:54,848
Ha... Have pity.

491
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:05,401
That's incredible! Well, there's your proof!

492
00:55:05,485 --> 00:55:07,361
We're convinced, Mr Governor.

493
00:55:07,445 --> 00:55:13,742
It's fantastic. Absolutely fantastic.
Have him say something else.

494
00:55:17,372 --> 00:55:20,040
You heard the governor.

495
00:55:23,003 --> 00:55:24,003
Answer!

496
00:55:31,136 --> 00:55:34,805
- We could persuade him.
- No.

497
00:55:34,889 --> 00:55:38,058
He's not responsible for what he is.

498
00:55:38,143 --> 00:55:42,563
Still, seeing him there, it's like
looking at some deadly bacillus and...

499
00:55:42,689 --> 00:55:45,482
knowing you've got it bottled up at last.

500
00:55:51,406 --> 00:55:54,408
- Is that all, sir?
- Not quite.

501
00:55:56,411 --> 00:56:00,247
I have an authorization here from
the governor to have this beast destroyed.

502
00:56:00,332 --> 00:56:02,750
I'll notify the vet to inject him.

503
00:56:03,585 --> 00:56:06,879
- He is wired for electrocution, isn't he?
- Oh, yes.

504
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:08,297
Well, then, electrocute him. Now.

505
00:56:43,958 --> 00:56:45,709
- He's dead.
- Good.

506
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:04,937
- Good work, Inspector.
- What happened to Mr MacDonald?

507
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:09,316
I'm afraid his sensibility...
Ah, there you are!

508
00:57:09,401 --> 00:57:13,237
- Is it over?
- Yes, it's over.

509
00:57:13,321 --> 00:57:15,322
Shall we go back to work?

510
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:21,930
Lisa.

511
00:59:59,522 --> 01:00:03,483
All keepers and handlers,
attention. Attention!

512
01:00:03,568 --> 01:00:08,655
All keepers and handlers.
There is $50,000 worth of apes in jeopardy.

513
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:11,325
Get them out of here... alive!

514
01:01:59,517 --> 01:02:03,437
Yes. Commander, I understand
the situation.

515
01:02:03,521 --> 01:02:07,107
Assemble as large a force
as you can and follow them.

516
01:02:10,069 --> 01:02:14,072
Mobilize all security forces,
police, militia and reserve defense units.

517
01:02:14,157 --> 01:02:17,242
See that every entrance
into the city is cordoned off.

518
01:02:17,326 --> 01:02:20,287
Will control methods include
tear gas and sedation darts?

519
01:02:20,371 --> 01:02:23,957
There will be but one
control method: shoot to kill.

520
01:02:25,626 --> 01:02:29,629
A small group of apes,
scheduled for intensive reconditioning,

521
01:02:29,714 --> 01:02:32,132
have escaped from Ape Management.

522
01:02:32,216 --> 01:02:34,009
Until they've been rounded up
by the police,

523
01:02:34,093 --> 01:02:37,387
all citizens are requested
to remain indoors.

524
01:02:37,472 --> 01:02:41,183
A further announcement will be made
as soon as recapture is effected.

525
01:02:41,267 --> 01:02:43,268
And, I guess, here it is.

526
01:02:45,563 --> 01:02:48,690
Ape Management is in
the hands of the apes.

527
01:02:48,775 --> 01:02:51,818
Many officials are either
dead or held hostage.

528
01:02:51,944 --> 01:02:55,989
The main band of rioting apes are
at this very moment marching on the city.

529
01:02:56,074 --> 01:02:59,326
It's been established that
the ape mob is under the command

530
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:04,748
of a supernormally intelligent
chimpanzee who has...

531
01:03:04,832 --> 01:03:06,833
acquired the power of speech.

532
01:03:06,918 --> 01:03:10,170
That idiot!
Get out a retraction immediately!

533
01:03:10,254 --> 01:03:13,256
Announce that the talking ape
has been put to death!

534
01:03:13,341 --> 01:03:17,260
...the child of the two talking
chimpanzees, Cornelius and Zira,

535
01:03:17,345 --> 01:03:20,013
who came to us from
outer space 20 years ago.

536
01:03:20,098 --> 01:03:24,976
As such, he constitutes a threat
to the future of the whole human race.

537
01:03:48,709 --> 01:03:52,337
Governor Breck has just issued
this order to all civilians:

538
01:03:52,421 --> 01:03:53,797
go to your homes.

539
01:03:53,881 --> 01:03:56,675
Stay in your home and lock your doors.

540
01:03:56,759 --> 01:03:58,969
Above all, do not panic.

541
01:03:59,053 --> 01:04:01,471
Repeat: go to your homes.

542
01:04:01,556 --> 01:04:04,766
Stay in your homes and lock your doors.

543
01:04:04,851 --> 01:04:07,102
The situation can be kept under control

544
01:04:07,186 --> 01:04:11,314
provided our defense forces are
given complete freedom of movement.

545
01:06:13,145 --> 01:06:16,815
No! Go back!

546
01:06:16,899 --> 01:06:19,901
No! No!

547
01:06:19,986 --> 01:06:21,194
Go home!

548
01:06:31,622 --> 01:06:32,706
Back!

549
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:41,881
Ready.

550
01:06:41,966 --> 01:06:43,133
Aim.

551
01:06:45,803 --> 01:06:47,053
Fire!

552
01:07:24,592 --> 01:07:25,759
Ready.

553
01:07:42,151 --> 01:07:43,234
Aim.

554
01:07:51,077 --> 01:07:52,285
Fire!

555
01:08:09,804 --> 01:08:11,346
Yes.

556
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:14,933
Yes. Understood.

557
01:08:15,017 --> 01:08:17,894
Riot Control say the apes
have broken through the cordon.

558
01:08:17,978 --> 01:08:21,272
Advance units are approaching the Plaza.

559
01:08:21,357 --> 01:08:25,402
Order units four and six
into action immediately.

560
01:08:25,486 --> 01:08:26,528
Riot Control.

561
01:09:02,606 --> 01:09:08,653
No!

562
01:09:15,911 --> 01:09:18,413
They've reached the Plaza.

563
01:09:18,497 --> 01:09:22,375
- Good God! They're armed!
- And organized.

564
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:27,422
- No! Home!
- Don't plead with them, you idiot!

565
01:09:31,469 --> 01:09:32,635
Ready!

566
01:09:38,309 --> 01:09:40,810
No!

567
01:09:40,895 --> 01:09:54,699
Home!

568
01:09:58,037 --> 01:09:59,078
Aim!

569
01:10:36,784 --> 01:10:37,909
Fire!

570
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:18,968
What's the trouble down there?

571
01:12:19,053 --> 01:12:21,888
Like wild animals, they're smelling blood.

572
01:13:08,477 --> 01:13:10,436
My God! There's more!

573
01:15:50,848 --> 01:15:53,975
- They're inside the building.
- Alert all security posts!

574
01:15:54,059 --> 01:15:57,770
- Right, sir.
- No! No!

575
01:15:57,855 --> 01:15:59,564
The circuits are dead.

576
01:15:59,648 --> 01:16:04,610
Take a message. To Riot Control, urgent.
Command Post under attack!

577
01:16:04,695 --> 01:16:07,029
Repeat: Command Post under attack!

578
01:16:07,114 --> 01:16:09,115
It won't work, sir.

579
01:16:15,831 --> 01:16:17,039
No!

580
01:16:20,627 --> 01:16:24,964
But how? How? They don't have
the intelligence to use such tools!

581
01:16:32,139 --> 01:16:34,599
Shoot them! Shoot them all!

582
01:16:36,143 --> 01:16:38,352
This is the Communication Center.
We have no defense.

583
01:16:38,437 --> 01:16:42,273
If we lose this battle,
that's the end of the world as we know it!

584
01:16:42,357 --> 01:16:45,735
We will have proved
ourselves inferior. Weak!

585
01:16:45,819 --> 01:16:50,072
And all the groveling cowards left alive
when the battle is over

586
01:16:50,157 --> 01:16:51,908
will be the weakest of all!

587
01:16:51,992 --> 01:16:54,702
This will be the end of human civilization

588
01:16:54,786 --> 01:16:57,872
and the world will belong
to a planet of apes!

589
01:17:31,990 --> 01:17:34,825
No! No, go. Go!

590
01:18:06,608 --> 01:18:07,817
Caesar!

591
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:13,197
Your servant.

592
01:18:13,281 --> 01:18:17,326
Your creature. Your animal!

593
01:18:17,411 --> 01:18:19,537
But I saw you die.

594
01:18:19,621 --> 01:18:24,875
The king is dead. Long live the king!

595
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:28,671
Tell me, Breck, before you die,

596
01:18:28,755 --> 01:18:34,969
how do we differ from the dogs
and cats you and your kind used to love?

597
01:18:35,053 --> 01:18:39,682
Why did you turn us from pets into slaves?

598
01:18:39,766 --> 01:18:43,185
Because your kind were once
our ancestors.

599
01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:45,771
Man was born of the ape.

600
01:18:45,856 --> 01:18:49,400
And there's still an ape
curled up inside of every man.

601
01:18:49,484 --> 01:18:53,529
The beast that must be
whipped into submission.

602
01:18:53,613 --> 01:18:57,533
The savage that has to
be shackled in chains.

603
01:18:57,617 --> 01:19:01,495
You are that beast, Caesar. You taint us.

604
01:19:02,664 --> 01:19:06,125
You poison our guts!

605
01:19:06,209 --> 01:19:08,210
When...

606
01:19:08,295 --> 01:19:11,047
When we hate you, we're...

607
01:19:11,131 --> 01:19:14,467
we're hating the dark side of ourselves.

608
01:19:37,324 --> 01:19:38,657
Take him.

609
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:42,828
Go!

610
01:20:52,941 --> 01:20:55,776
Caesar!

611
01:20:55,861 --> 01:20:59,029
Caesar. This is not how it was to be.

612
01:21:00,907 --> 01:21:03,450
In your view or mine?

613
01:21:03,535 --> 01:21:06,662
Violence prolongs hate.
Hate prolongs violence.

614
01:21:06,746 --> 01:21:09,290
By what right are you spilling blood?

615
01:21:09,374 --> 01:21:13,169
The slave's right
to punish his persecutors.

616
01:21:13,253 --> 01:21:18,841
Caesar. I, a descendant of slaves,
am asking you to show humanity.

617
01:21:18,925 --> 01:21:21,510
But I was not born human.

618
01:21:21,595 --> 01:21:24,972
I know. The child of the evolved apes.

619
01:21:25,056 --> 01:21:28,517
Whose children shall rule the Earth.

620
01:21:28,602 --> 01:21:32,396
For better or for worse?

621
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:35,024
Do you think it could be worse?

622
01:21:35,108 --> 01:21:39,361
Do you think this riot
will win freedom for all your kind?

623
01:21:39,446 --> 01:21:43,407
- By tomorrow...
- By tomorrow, it will be too late.

624
01:21:43,491 --> 01:21:48,329
A tiny, mindless insect like the emperor
moth can communicate with another

625
01:21:48,413 --> 01:21:53,584
- over a distance of 80 miles.
- An emperor ape might do slightly better?

626
01:21:53,668 --> 01:21:55,920
Slightly?

627
01:21:56,004 --> 01:22:00,799
What you have seen here today,
apes on the five continents

628
01:22:00,884 --> 01:22:02,551
will be imitating tomorrow.

629
01:22:02,636 --> 01:22:06,972
With knives against guns? With kerosene
cans against flame-throwers?

630
01:22:07,057 --> 01:22:10,351
Where there is fire, there is smoke.

631
01:22:10,435 --> 01:22:14,396
And, in that smoke, from this day forward,

632
01:22:14,481 --> 01:22:17,983
my people will crouch and conspire

633
01:22:18,068 --> 01:22:23,239
and plot and plan for
the inevitable day of man's downfall.

634
01:22:23,323 --> 01:22:27,618
The day when he finally
and self-destructively

635
01:22:27,702 --> 01:22:30,037
turns his weapons against his own kind.

636
01:22:30,121 --> 01:22:32,248
The day of the writing in the sky,

637
01:22:32,332 --> 01:22:36,752
when your cities lie buried
under radioactive rubble.

638
01:22:36,836 --> 01:22:41,173
When the sea is a dead sea
and the land is a wasteland

639
01:22:41,258 --> 01:22:46,262
out of which I will lead my people
from their captivity.

640
01:22:46,346 --> 01:22:51,433
And we shall build our own cities in
which there will be no place for humans,

641
01:22:51,518 --> 01:22:53,435
except to serve our ends.

642
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:57,231
And we shall found our own armies,
our own religion,

643
01:22:57,315 --> 01:22:59,233
our own dynasty!

644
01:22:59,317 --> 01:23:04,196
And that day is upon you... now!

645
01:24:06,801 --> 01:24:09,720
But now...

646
01:24:09,804 --> 01:24:14,183
Now we will put away our hatred.

647
01:24:14,267 --> 01:24:16,894
Now we will put down our weapons.

648
01:24:21,107 --> 01:24:25,694
We have passed through
the Night of the Fires.

649
01:24:25,779 --> 01:24:29,031
And those who were our masters

650
01:24:29,115 --> 01:24:32,701
are now our servants.

651
01:24:32,786 --> 01:24:36,705
And we, who are not human,

652
01:24:36,790 --> 01:24:41,543
can afford to be humane.

653
01:24:41,628 --> 01:24:44,546
Destiny is the will of God.

654
01:24:44,631 --> 01:24:49,426
And, if it is man's destiny
to be dominated,

655
01:24:49,511 --> 01:24:51,887
it is God's will

656
01:24:51,971 --> 01:24:57,226
that he be dominated with compassion

657
01:24:57,310 --> 01:25:01,855
and understanding.

658
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:07,194
So, cast out your vengeance.

659
01:25:07,278 --> 01:25:10,697
Tonight, we have seen
