Why? What are you doing?

179
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,165
I promised Mitch
I would sit and watch

180
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,249
a game with him
tonight, and...

181
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,383
What?

182
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,463
Can we please just slide
the Dialogue Night again?

183
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,546
I'm so sorry.

184
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,134
I can do Monday night.

185
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,143
Thank you.

186
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:13,808
(DOORBELL RINGS)
He's early.

187
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,563
Yeah, you'd be early, too,

188
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,061
if all you did all day
was eat hummus and masturbate.

189
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,233
What's hummus?

190
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,486
That is a Mediterranean
spread, honey.

191
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,896
What's master-ate?

192
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,610
It's a cracker.

193
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,780
Oh, hey, Mitch.
Your hair looks good.

194
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:28,989
Thanks.

195
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:32,281
Yeah, I had to cut it for a
fucking tampon commercial.

196
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,494
CARA: Uncle Mitch!
(GASPS)

197
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,871
How's my favorite
ballerina doing?

198
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,169
Hi, Uncle Mitch.
Hi! Wow!

199
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,668
Gosh, you're so light.
Are you dieting?

200
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,582
Do you want to come
to my dance recital?

201
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:43,883
Oh!

202
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,007
No, honey.

203
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,171
The only style of dancing
that Uncle Mitch likes

204
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:51,808
involves a big, shiny pole, and a
broken woman with daddy issues.

205
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,009
(GROANS)

206
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,473
Yeah, story time is over.

207
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,183
Go fix your hair.

208
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,263
Ow.

209
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,141
Mmm, smells good
in here, Jame.

210
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,225
Mmm.

211
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,314
Ooh! Num-nums!

212
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,028
Vegetable medley!

213
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,189
How are you?
Good.

214
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:07,699
You're good?
Yeah.

215
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,200
Are you dating anyone?

216
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,861
Ooh! You know who I ran into?
Who?

217
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,868
Mrs. Hickham at a
Starbucks in Druid Hills.

218
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,828
Our social studies teacher?
Yeah.

219
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,537
I asked her out and she
wouldn't go out with me,

220
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,623
which is crazy, because I
nailed her in high school.

221
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,877
You did? I dated her mouth
for a full semester.

222
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:27,048
(LAUGHING) Okay.
Bathed, diapered, and in the PJs.

223
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,546
Is Dave meeting
your needs, sexually?

224
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,299
Yeah, I guess.
MITCH: Good.

225
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:33,883
Not really, mmm-mmm.
Ahh.

226
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,015
I would like to strap you to
my face and say the alphabet.

227
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,313
That's going too far.

228
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,606
Oh!

229
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,903
Look at these
little fuckers!

230
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,527
What's your name? Hey.

231
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,034
What's your name?
What's your name?

232
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,536
Why can't they talk yet?
Are they retarded or something?

233
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:54,912
Don't say...
You can't say that.

234
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,494
Well, this one right here
looks a little Downsy.

235
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,830
Or that.
MITCH: I'm kidding.

236
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,370
A little bit, though?
No.

237
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,584
DAVE: Pumpkin, we'll see you
right after the game, okay?

238
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,838
JAMIE: Have fun.

239
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,250
I like it. Oh, God. (CRYING)

240
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,011
Let's go.
Okay. Bye.

241
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,180
(BOTH BABIES CRYING)
(SIGHS)

242
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,432
MITCH: Mitch and Dave.

243
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,719
DAVE: Mitch and Dave,
out on the town.

244
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,683
Oh, dude,
I didn't tell you!

245
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,438
I booked a major
movie role this week.

246
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,605
I auditioned for
a movie role, I got it.

247
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,732
Yeah, first one. Hey, good for you.
What is it called?

248
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,565
Untitled Awesome Movie.

249
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,274
Truly? That's the name?

250
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,939
Yeah.
Yeah. Good for you.

251
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,199
Do you want to hotbox this nut sack?
No, no.

252
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,735
I've got a big day tomorrow.
Take the wheel. Steer. Steering wheel.

253
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,028
Oh, steer for me.

254
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,697
Mitch, come on, buddy.

255
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:40,083
Let's make it to the game in
one piece, don't you think?

256
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:43,120
Want to try that?
This Fiero, unfortunately, is airbag-free.

257
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:44,412
It's a work
day tomorrow.

258
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,298
Come on.
All right, I'll take one hit.

259
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,759
Oh! What the...
You motherfucker!

260
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,215
Let's just focus
on the driving.

261
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,256
Just say no, Reagan.
God, why would you do that?

262
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,924
Well, we're driving.
God!

263
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,468
This is a car carrying a lot of speed.
This is terrible.

264
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:01,138
Hit the steering wheel.
I'm going again!

265
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:06,477
(ALL CHEERING)

266
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:08,986
Whoo! Drink!

267
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,606
I'll drink to that. All right!
That was a strikeout.

268
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,368
Huh, what's going on?
It is good to see you again.

269
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,987
It's good to see you,
too, Dave.

270
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,450
What's going on
with the women, huh?

271
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:21,583
I've been seeing a number
of very, very nice ladies.

272
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,414
I got some pictures.
Wow.

273
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,004
That is Tatiana.

274
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,335
Tatiana.

275
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:29,624
What's her last name?

276
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:33,841
It's Tatiana Calls-me- at-three-in-the-morning-
and-wants-to-fuck-stein.

277
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,630
Who gives a shit what her last name is?
(LAUGHS)

278
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,508
Mitch. Reminds me
a little bit of Sabrina.

279
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,348
Yeah! Wait,
who's Sabrina?

280
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,013
Sabrina. She's this...
(EXHALES FORCEFULLY)

281
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,352
She's this new law
associate at my work.

282
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:48,394
She's so hot.
Oh, Mitch, is she hot. Uh-oh.

283
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:51,146
She's like fall-out-of-a-magazine
hot, you know?

284
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,155
I bet she's number one
on your cancer list, right?

285
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,232
What is that?

286
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,692
Come on, you know what that is.
What is that?

287
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,280
Every married guy
has a cancer list.

288
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,953
It's the first three women
you'd have sex with

289
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,371
if your wife suddenly
died of cancer.

290
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,203
That's fucking sick.

291
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,534
Come on.
That's the mother of my children.

292
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,617
Oh, I know.

293
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:07,204
But I'll play.
Yes, she'd be at the top of that list.

294
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,542
It's like a gift.
Yeah.

295
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,878
(LAUGHS) But I interrupted you.
Tell me about this one again.

296
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,759
God, last week,
Tatiana, she comes over,

297
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,587
she's wearing this
tight black mini-dress,

298
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,717
and you know
what she says to me?

299
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,382
Tell me slow.
No, nothing.

300
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,550
Because all Tatiana wants to
do at 3:00 in the morning

301
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,765
is fucky, fucky,
rubber ducky.

302
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,350
This chick is insatiable!

303
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,891
She wants it in every
position under the sun.

304
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,274
God, you're so lucky.

305
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,857
We do the Wheelbarrow,
the Arabian Goggles,

306
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,273
the Lonesome Dove,
the Arsenio Hall,

307
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:37,568
the Jelly Donut, the Pastrami
Sandwich, the Wolfgang Puck...

308
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,736
And let me tell you something,
no man is that hungry.

309
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,370
What? I don't even
know what these are.

310
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,452
You're married. You're married, Dave.
That's true.

311
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,082
Anyway,
we start going at it

312
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,040
and it gets so intense
that my nose starts bleeding.

313
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,166
Come on.

314
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,668
This is Dracula,
Anne Rice-type shit

315
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:52,874
happening right
in front of me.

316
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,004
Good for you.

317
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,461
When all is said and done, when we
finish up, and the dust settles,

318
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,254
she looks up at me,
and she says,

319
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:02,801
"Mitchell, next Tuesday,
I am coming back here,

320
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,095
"and we're
really going to fuck."

321
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:06,767
Yes!

322
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,432
Yes! Tatiana.

323
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,727
Fuck. Mitch, Mitch, Mitch.

324
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:12,940
You're just...

325
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,737
How did I miss this?

326
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:17,945
I missed all the sex and the
drugs and the bad choices,

327
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,077
and I just fucking rushed it, didn't I?
Wasn't I rushing?

328
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,244
You were busy.

329
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,788
Rushing to get into
a good college, right?

330
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,368
And then into
a good law school.

331
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:26,791
Once I got into
a good law school,

332
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,205
I just wanted to get
into a good law firm.

333
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,457
I met Jamie, we got married,
we had Cara, and that was it.

334
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,965
I pissed away my 20s, right?
Now it's too late.

335
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,759
Look, shitbird.
You got it made!

336
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,841
You have an
extremely hot wife,

337
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,926
and you got
a beautiful house

338
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:44,093
that's full of furniture
and food and kids.

339
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,510
And you make
a ton of money.

340
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,349
And you come home
at the end of the day

341
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,607
and you're surrounded by people
who give a shit about you.

342
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,109
You're never lonely.

343
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,314
What more do you want?

344
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,070
I'll tell you
what I want, okay?

345
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,362
I want something
different.

346
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,198
I want your life,
you know?

347
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:02,031
I want Sabrina.
I want Tatiana.

348
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,616
And sex with strange,
new women.

349
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:05,780
You're living the dream.

350
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:08,541
How much fun is it being an
actor, working one week a year?

351
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,202
I want to smoke
weed all day.

352
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:14,339
I want to start a book
that I actually finish.

353
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,670
I would like to take
a nice, solid dump

354
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,919
because I'm not
constantly stressed out.

355
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,838
I want to learn
how to rollerblade.

356
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:23,972
And I'd like
to take a piss.

357
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,800
Me, too.
Fountain, fountain, fountain.

358
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,180

MITCH: This chick does
not look happy.

361
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:46,450
I was just saying that
I really envy your life.

362
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:47,621
That's all.
I envy yours.

363
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,540
No, you don't. You're
just trying to be nice.

364
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,292
I'm not.
I do, I envy it.

365
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,873
No. I envy yours.

it's rolling
blackouts or something?

369
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,397
Yeah, I guess.

370
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,819
Look at your flow,
it's so nice and thick.

371
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:27,028
It's confident.

372
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:30,157
Yours is very steamy.
Thanks.

373
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,329
My urologist says
I run a little hot.

374
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,789
Good to go?
Oh, yeah.

375
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,625
Can you drive?
Oh, yeah!

00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:11,156

these goddamn pillows?

What am I doing in this bed?
Did I sleep here last night?

385
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,921
Did I fucking nail you?

386
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,472
Are you still drunk?

387
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:31,342

00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,769

than what you see on TV, Mitch.

Is there?
Yeah.

No!

Wrong, my friend. You don't know the
first thing about being a lawyer.

Great!

00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,879
Go to my house, get
dressed in my clothes.

506
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,844
Then you go to my office, find
my legal associate, Sabrina.

507
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,599
Get the merger
documents from her,

508
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,518
take them to
the conference room, and...

509
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,099
Oh, God, the partners
are going to be there.

510
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:29,607
Listen, do not say
a single word.

511
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,766
What if somebody
asks me a question?

512
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,560
They're not going to
ask you a damn thing.

513
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,444
Once the meeting starts, you
will continue to say nothing.

514
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,401
When a partner asks you
for the merger documents,

515
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:39,443
you will then
silently hand them over.

516
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,281
I get it. Play it big,
but maintain my reality.

517
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,615
It's pretty simple.
No! You play it small.

518
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,155
I have spent
the last nine months

519
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:45,535
banging out
the terms of this deal.

520
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,871
The only thing you have to do is
hand over the documents, that's it.

521
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,951
Dude, easy as fuck.

522
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,120
You can't say things like
that in the meeting, Mitch.

523
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,288
True. Good note.

524
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,923
For me, you go to my house, okay?
All my info is on my fridge.

525
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,005
When you get to the set,
you go to hair and makeup,

526
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,085
and you learn your lines.

527
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:00,596
Most of all, do not fuck
this up for me, all right?

528
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,633
This is my big break, my Raging Bull.
Do you hear me?

529
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,767
You respect my art,
you respect my life.

530
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:06,927
You respect mine.

531
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,596
Yeah, I got you. Power hug.
Come on. Yeah, okay.

532
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,646
(EXCLAIMS) Hold on.
You got to pick up Cara.

533
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,810
Pick up Cara from
ballet at 4:00, okay?

534
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:16,320
I am fucking all
over that shit.

535
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,071
Holy shit.

536
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:19,319
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

537
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,505
Early morning on the
golf course, Lockwood?

538
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,290
Ha-ha! Terrific!

539
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,013
Num-nums!

540
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,019
(LAUGHS) Fucking score!

541
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,146
Fucking grocery store.

542
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:56,144
Look at all of this
for little Mitchie-poo.

543
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,777
Nice!

544
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,859
Oh, there you are.

545
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,658
I redid the 10-19 variants,
everything else is the same. Ready?

546
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,027
Oh, you must
be Sabrina, huh?

547
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:06,953
You must be Dave.

548
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:08,781
Are we role-playing or something?
Because we're late.

549
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,033
He didn't tell me you were
a big, fat, fucking boner.

550
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,791
Sorry. That was unprofessional.
Wasn't it?

551
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:17,548
Dave have a mimosa for breakfast?
A little nervous?

552
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:18,707
That was a joke. Hey...

553
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,876
I've got one really important
question before we go.

554
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,886
All this food here,
is it free?

555
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:26,507
You got this.

556
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:27,675
Yeah, I got it.

557
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,847
I got it.
Okay. (LAUGHS)

558
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,010
Let's do this.

559
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:31,721
All right.
You remember though?

560
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,106
Oh, right.
It's down there. Got it.

561

(PEOPLE TALKING)

562
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,628
Lockwood.
Yep.

563
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,378
Perhaps you would like to sit
on our side of the table.

564
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,877
Thanks.

565
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:11,264
FLEMMING: Now, before we
formalize this merger,

566
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:15,148
are there any outstanding
questions we might address?

567
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,311
Our back-of-the-envelope
analysis

568

(CHAIR CLICKING LOUDLY) shows your
P&L to be 2% less than expected

569
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,775
as per the MAC clause.

570
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,778
Can I get confirmation
that the EBITDA

571
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,160
still aligns
with comfortable...

572
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,279
Dave?

573
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:34,792
Dave!
Yes. Dave is here.

574
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:38,287
Hey, man.

575
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:39,459
Hey.

00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,127
Oh, I've got your thing.

Boom!

578
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,632
No, Dave, uh...

579
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:49,515
Mr. Kinkabe had a question
about the EBITDA.

580
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,471
Okay.

581
00:25:58,474 --> 00:25:59,475
Uh, how is it?

582
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,146
Good.

583
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,483
Good?

584
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:10,368
What am I saying?

585
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,154
EBITDA is bad.

586
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,372
Fucking terrible.

587
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,992
(ALL MURMURING)

588
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:18,703
Are you saying the premium
needs to be adjusted?

589
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,037
I didn't say that.

590
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:21,956
Did you hear
me say it? Nope.

591
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,123
What about our WACC?

592
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,584
Huh? What PPS multiple
are you using?

593
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,669
What's that?
Is the financing still stable?

594
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:28,800
Hang on, guys.

595
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:31,723
Fucking 25 guys on this side.
Can you fire at somebody else?

596
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,259
Can anybody else
field the fucking question?

597
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,098
Dave?
Yep.

598
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,683
It's your job
to know this.

599
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,853
Yeah, and I know that.

600
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:43,273
You know, we're...

00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,020
Here is the deal.

(IMITATING ASIAN ACCENT)
Everybody rich!

604
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,570
So let's sign this.

605
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,535
What's the worst
that can happen? Right?

606
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,995
We will just
roll this party out

607
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,415
to some sushi and
some sake bombs.

608
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,706
Moustache is buying.
And then a little karaoke for dessert?

609
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,044
What have we
got to lose?

610
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:08,051
Let's bones that.
Huh, 'stache?

611
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,587
KINKABE: Is this
some kind of joke?

612
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,422
Are you trying to
poison the well?

613
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,636
You are the one on a fishing
expedition, Kinkabe.

614
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,722
You were never serious
about this merger.

615
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:16,848
KINKABE: Me?

616
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:19,555
This moron works for you.
You are the one sabotaging it.

617
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,769
Fuck you with that...
"Moron" is a bad word here.

618
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:22,933
This merger is over.

619
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,320
You have just made the biggest
mistake of your career, mister.

620
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,071
I will see you in court. No, no.

621
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,483
What a bunch
of bullshit!

622
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,902
Hang on.
Don't get up.

623
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,241
Is this a break?
Taking a break?

624
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,288

was that?

Relax. This is good.

628
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,414
Look at how
great this is.

629
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,084
It's all part of my
secret master plan.

630
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,752
It is?
You bet.

631
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:50,919
You are hurting my
arm a little bit.

632
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,800
This deal is critical to the
very survival of this firm.

633
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,309
Is that clear?
I got it.

634
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,887
I know what I'm doing.
I've been doing it for...

635
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,347
How long have I
been doing it here, huh?

636
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,311
How long have I worked here?
You know that.

637
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,645
(EXHALES)
I don't know.

638
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,564
Nine years, 10.
Yeah.

639
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,941
Yeah. Perfect.
Exactly 10 years, that's exactly right.

640
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,856
And have I ever
steered you wrong?

641
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,487
No.

642
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:14,943
Trust me, bro.

00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,195
Bro?

644
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:18,947
Fine.

645
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:22,623
But from here on out, you are
on an extremely short leash!

646
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:23,876
Understand?

647
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,630
Now, go.
Put on some proper clothes.

648
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:27,880
You look like a Jew.

649
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:29,796

Oh, look at that.
That looks like fun.

Ready for you on set.

Anything I can get you?
Vitamin water or Pellegrino?

659
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,172
No, thank you.
I just have a quick question.

660
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:13,927
What does that mean,
there, "TS?"

661
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:15,880
Titty shot.

662
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,923
And, "BTS,"
right there?

coming to the set.

665
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,306
I'm just curious, what
kind of movie is this?

666
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:26,390
It's a Iorno.

667
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,188
I'm not familiar with that genre.
Is that European?

668
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:31,945
Lorno, "Light porno."
Tits and shadows.

00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,856
You ever hear
of Skinemax?

670
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:38,944
Oh, no.

671
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,074
Come on, big guy.

672
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:42,281
(WITH ACCENT) No, no, no.
More oil.

Make him shiny
like fish.

674
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:44,866
Are you the one
in charge here?

675
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,035
Mitch, I'm Valtan,
the director.

676
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,671
Oh, good. There's been
some kind of mistake...

677
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:50,793
Mona!

678
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,253
Where the fuck is...
I'm here!

679
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,375
Hey!

680
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:56,379
Here's the scene, okay?
You going to enter with a gun...

681
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:57,717
Where the gun?

682
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,845
Mitch, you going to come in.
Guard going to try to stop you.

683
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:04,269
Line, line, line.
You knock him the fuck out, okay?

684
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,471
You see Mona.
She lying there in the bed.

685
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,353

00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,451
Oh, it's like a poem!
It's like a poem!

in our movie film.

00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,645
Hey, Mitch.
Jamie, we need to talk.

869
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:11,813
Are you going to
stay for dinner?

870
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,779
No, I can't stay for dinner,
but I would love to...

871
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,113
Look, I got to
tell you something.

872
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:18,825
I can't talk right now, Mitch.
It's been so crazy here.

873
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:20,910
The twins are a half-hour
past their bedtime.

874
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,495
What are you doing?
What are you, some kind of animal?

875
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,080
And Cara has to
start her homework.

876
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,588
I have an emergency phone
call in four minutes.

877
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:29,919
You know that building?

878
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,004
The 11-story building?
Yup.

879
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:35,296
I have to remove three stories somehow.
Isn't that crazy?

880
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:36,379
Yeah.

881
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:37,806
It's so ridiculous.
It makes no sense at all.

882
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,181
I'm not Mitch.

883
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,306
What?
I'm Mitch.

884
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:44,563
He's Mitch. I'm Mitch.
Somehow we switched bodies.

885
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,139
And I'm Dave.
That's Dave. Yeah.

886
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,269
Oh.

887
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,976
What happened was, we pissed
in a magic fountain...

888
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:51,816
Uh-huh. ...
and the next day it disappeared.

889
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,197
They moved the fountain,
so now we're looking for it.

890
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,198
And when they find it,
we're going to switch back.

891
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,358
We had to pee
because we were drinking.

892
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,617
We were drinking.

893
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:01,030
That sounds like a plan.
Can you start the bath for the twins?

894
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,035
Okay, pumpkin, this is...

895
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:05,200
(EXCLAIMING) Mitch, no.

896
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,536
Don't call me
pumpkin, okay?

897
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,875
And you promised me that
you would clean out...

898
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,381
Can you shut this off?

899
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,883
It smells like cabbage now!
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, sit down.

900
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,840
One second.
Just humor me, all right?

901
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,221
I want you to
ask me one thing...

902
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,380
I don't want to
play your games.

903
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,548
...That only Dave
would be able to answer.

904
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,513
Just one question.
Please, I'm begging you.

905
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:23,892
Good idea.

906
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,397
Okay, when is
our anniversary, Dave?

907
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,066
April 17th.
Next question, please.

908
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,267
Wrong.

909
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:32,693
So close. Nineteenth.

910
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,067
Seventeenth's your daughter's
birthday, 19th's your anniversary.

911
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,698
DAVE: Why do you know that?
MITCH: Do you think I'm a monster?

912
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,658
I send you a card every year.
Jamie, listen to me.

913
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:39,734
Ask me anything else.

914
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,987
Oh, my gosh!
Mitch,

915
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,072
I don't have
time for this!

916
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,241
Come on, one more.
Just make it tough.

917
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,159
Only Dave would know.
A stumper.

918
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,921
Fine. What is my
favorite color, Dave?

919
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,668
Red.
Celadon.

920
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,008
Do you not understand what we're
trying to accomplish here?

921
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,763
Not a drop of
the red in the room.

922
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:02,265
All the accents
are celadon.

923
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,424
It's like
the opposite of help.

924
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,894
Okay, honey, I got it.

925
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,020
I'm going to
tell you something

926
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,598
that only I, Dave,
would know.

927
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,563
Three years ago,
you took your vibrator...

928
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,274
(WHISPERING) You took your vibrator...
Morning!

929
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:18,531
...Into the bathtub
and it short-circuited

930
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,279
and it electrocuted
your vagina.

931
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,359
Hang on.

932
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,946
And there's now the cutest
little bald spot right there.

933
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:26,660
(LAUGHING)

934
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:30,793
Yeah.

935
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:38,759
Hi.

936
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,549
Oh, my God.

937
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,469
I know. It's me.
This hasn't been fun.

938
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:44,632
Good story.

939
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,767
You son of a bitch!

940
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:49,141
How dare you
tell him that?

941
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,221
God!
(EXCLAIMS)

942
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:52,649
What is wrong
with you two?

943
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:53,808
God damn!

944
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,810
How would you
like it if I told him

945
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:58,400
that you have a ball
that feels like two balls?

946
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,815
So it's like you
have three balls.

947
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:03,781
Dave has three balls.
A bouquet of balls.

948
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,952
Bad! Bad!

949
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,072
(BABIES CRYING)

950
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:08,748
This idea fucking sucked.

951
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,336
Listen, I don't want you
to worry about anything.

952
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:14,495
I'll be able to
hold down the fort.

953
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,005
We got to find that fountain
as soon as possible.

954
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:18,166
It's like a can of
tennis balls down here.

955
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,960
The only problem I see is,
what do I tell Jamie?

956
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,127
What do you
tell Jamie, what?

957
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:23,422
When she wants to
have sex tonight?

958
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:24,964
Think about that.

959
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,511
You're not having sex
with my wife, Mitch.

960
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,603
Obviously, bro.

961
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,180
But if she comes at
me like a hurricane,

962
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:33,807
a guy can only
withstand so much.

963
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,437
Mitch.

964
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:38,269
Dave. We're trying to pull
something off here, okay?

965
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,279
Now, I might have to hit that, okay?
She'll know.

966
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,691
Now, how many times a day
do you guys have sex?

967
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,030
I'll have
to pace it out.

968
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:46,694
What day is it today?

969
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:49,535
I don't know.
Is it Tuesday?

970
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,660
Yeah. You know what?
It's a non-issue.

971
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,499
What does that mean?
You guys don't have sex on Tuesdays?

972
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,000
(LAUGHING)

973
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:58,539
Take the day off?

974
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,169
That's adorable.

975
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:04,712
Tell you what.

976
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,509
If she comes on
like a hurricane...

977
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:09,892
Just drill it.

978
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:12,804
Yeah, what can you do?
You're only human. Give me the keys.

979
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,977
Smart.
Yeah.

980
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,561
Okay. Please be
careful with her.

981
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,351
It's like we're
swapping rides.

982
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:19,565
It's just like that.

983
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,239
Thanks, buddy,
you're being very cool.

984
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,747
(SIGHS)

985
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,206
Dear God.

986
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:44,507
Oh, my goodness.
Look at this, huh?

987
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,256
Bang. Thank you, Mommy.

988
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:50,387
Why don't you tell Daddy about
what happened at school today?

989
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,053
I wrote a spring poem

990
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:57,440
and Miss Byers only put
Angelica's poem up on the wall

991
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,942
and she didn't put my
poem up on the wall.

992
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,603
And why would
she do that?

993
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,021
I thought
she liked me.

994
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,355
Dave.
Yeah.

995
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,694
Cara's talking to you.

996
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,109
What?
She's talking to you.

997
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:11,913
Well, Cara, her poem was
probably much better than yours.

998
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:13,952
Let's eat.
Dave.

999
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:15,367
I didn't read
the bitch's poem,

1000
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,248
but maybe she can really turn a phrase.
Let's eat.

1001
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:20,421
Tell Cara that
her poem was good.

1002
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,623
You just hurt
her feelings.

1003
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,922
I didn't read her poem, either.
Do you want me to lie to her?

1004
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:26,878
Is that what this is?
Fine, I don't care.

1005
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:31,384
Cara, honey, your poem,
which I did not read,

1006
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,302
was way, way better
than the other girl's poem,

1007
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:36,642
which I also did not read.

1008
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:38,564
Let's eat.

1009
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,142
It's Cara. Not Cara.

1010
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:42,643
It's what?

1011
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:44,646
Are you having a stroke
right now or something?

1012
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:47,816
What did I call her?
What about the dinner song, Daddy?

1013
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,901
What about the what?

1014
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,327
What's she saying?
The dinner song.

1015
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,528
What's that?
The dinner song?

1016
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,993
Are you joking me?
No, I'm not joking you.

1017
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:56,908
There's a song?
Sing the dinner song, honey.

1018
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,288
Course, there's a song.
Just sing the dinner song.

1019
00:42:58,451 --> 00:42:59,498
I don't feel like
singing it tonight.

1020
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,661
No, sing the dinner song.

1021
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:01,829
You sing the dinner song.

1022
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,839
Maybe you need to sing the dinner song.
Sing the dinner song.

1023
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:04,999
I'm sick of that song.

1024
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:06,509
Sing the dinner song.
Sing it!

1025
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,089
I got it. I heard you.

1026
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,754
(SINGING NOTE)

1027
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:14,510
Dinner song

1028
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,849
Dinner song

1029
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,267
(BABIES CRYING)

1030
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:23,147
Beans, potatoes,
carrots and broccoli

1031
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:28,315
Buns and sa/ad
and potatoes and chicken

1032
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:30,992
Needs a lickin'

1033
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,322
Dinner song.

1034
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:34,283
That's so not
the dinner song.

1035
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,038
Well, I'm going
to tell you what.

1036
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:38,291
You're going to go ahead
and write me a dinner poem,

1037
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,826
and I'll belt that out
after I choke this down.

1038
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:40,993
Let's fucking go.

is this cheating?

any part of your dick

gets up inside some woman

is firmly planted

No. It was not

you wanted, Dave.

00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:36,886
Is there a reason that you're
calling me at 3:00 in the morning?

1210
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:39,896
Yeah, the dock worker is making
me feed the twins. What do I do?

1211
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,270
Get them to the kitchen.
Yup, hold on.

1212
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:45,853
(BABIES CONTINUE WAILING)

1213
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,651
Stop crying.
Jesus Christ.

1214
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:54,491
Shut up!
I fucking hear you.

1215
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,614
Mitch.

1216
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,118
Please. Enough!

1217
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:02,412
You, there. Stay.

1218
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:04,455
Stay.

1219
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:08,042
All right.
In the kitchen.

1220
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,881
Go to the fridge.
Okay.

1221
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,254
Oh.

1222
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:13,555
Mitch. Are you there yet?

1223
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:15,136
I'm at the fridge.

1224
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:16,516
Defrost two bags
of breast milk

1225
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:17,851
in the microwave
for three minutes.

1226
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:19,011
And then prepare
two separate bottles.

1227
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,095
Breast milk?

1228
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,063
First, attach
the filter to the seal.

1229
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:24,350
Use the blue ones,
not the pink ones.

1230
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:26,314
Defrost two bags.
Yup.

1231
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:29,356
Pretty intuitive.
Then after the milk is defrosted,

1232
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:30,773
take it out
of the microwave,

1233
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:33,367
pour it into the bottles,
sea/ them.

1234
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:35,277
Then you need to put three-eighths
of a teaspoon of water...

1235
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:36,829
Holy shit!

1236
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:38,406
(EXCLAIMING)

1237
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:41,125
Come on, dude. Christ!

1238
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,706
Mitch. Hey,
are you listening to me?

1239
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,416
Holy fuck!

1240
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:47,206
This is important stuff
Do not screw this up.

1241
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:48,374
Hey!

1242
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,000
What was that?

1243
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:53,012
Mitch ? Mitch!

1244
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,548
Everything's fine, dude.
What's next?

1245
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,432
Then you need to
put three-eighths...

1246
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:58,808
What the fuck?
(ELECTRICITY SPARKING)

1247
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:02,350
Holy shit! Fuck!

1248
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:04,640
What just happened?

1249
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:07,230
Nothing. Nothing, dude.
Go on. Two bottles...

1250
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:09,816
Then attach a number two nipple.
Jesus Christ.

1251
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:11,855
Make sure you don't allow
any air bubbles in.

1252
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:14,157
Then, after you're
done feeding them...

1253
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:15,818
This is so fucked up.

1254
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:18,654
Yeah!

1255
00:53:19,655 --> 00:53:20,656
All right.

1256
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:25,874
This is what you get, okay?
Yeah, right there.

1257
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:29,006
Mitch.
Okay, dude.

1258
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:32,293
Tomorrow morning, when I
am sitting in your office,

1259
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,382
you need to be downtown,

1260
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,964
finding that
fucking fountain.

1261
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:39,304
I do not know how
much more of this shit...

1262
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,268
(BABIES LAUGHING)
...I can take.

1263
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:44,855
I'm one of the guys
looking for the fountain

1264
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,102
that you lost
in the computer.

1265
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:49,144
I'd be very, very appreciative if
you could tell me where that is.

1266
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:50,773
Yeah, I can do that.

1267
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:51,854
Good. Great.

1268
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:54,065
First, you got to fill out a
formal information request.

1269
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:56,363
Okay, I'm going to
fill that out right now.

1270
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:57,572
Then it needs
to go to State.

1271
00:53:57,693 --> 00:54:00,162
State?
Yeah, to get approved.

1272
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,622
Why can't you
approve it, Victor?

1273
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,579
I don't have
that authority.

1274
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:07,707
How long is it going to take
State to approve it, then?

1275
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,834
Three days...
Oh, God!

1276
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:12,091
...To three weeks.
Oh, come on!

1277
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:13,922
Victor!

1278
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,223
Mitch? Dave?

1279
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:21,633
Hello?

1280
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:24,602
Fuck!

1281
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:28,932
Real bad news...

1282
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,897
Oh, hey. Where's...

1283
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,020
Where's Dave?

1284
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:36,198
Dave's in the shower.

1285
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:39,026
Are you okay?

1286
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,321
Hey.

1287
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:45,745
What's going on?

1288
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,540
Dave's just acting
really weird.

1289
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,417
How?

1290
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:55,001
He's just doing
weird stuff,

1291
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:59,631
like he wore his shower
sandals to work yesterday.

1292
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:03,430
He forgot to pick up
the twins from daycare.

1293
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:05,852
No, he didn't.
Yeah, he did.

1294
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:09,557
They had to sit there
for an hour and a half.

1295
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:10,940
Okay.

1296
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,477
(CRYING) And then
last night he told me

1297
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,188
that he wasn't
attracted to me any more.

1298
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:18,565
I am going to kill him.

1299
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:21,610
I just want you to tell me
something right now, okay?

1300
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:24,155
And you have to be
totally honest with me.

1301
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:25,205
Sure.
You swear?

1302
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,281
Yeah.

1303
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,367
Is he having an affair?

1304
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:31,124
No.

1305
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:33,584
Why did you
hesitate just then?

1306
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:35,086
I didn't hesitate.

1307
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,259
He's not having an affair.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

1308
00:55:37,626 --> 00:55:39,549
Jamie, Jamie...

1309
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:41,930
You guys are
just going through

1310
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:45,100
a temporary rough
patch right now.

1311
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:47,933
Temporary rough patch?
What are you talking about?

1312
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:50,268
We've been in this
for years.

1313
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,104
You have?

1314
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:56,229
I love him. You know I love
him with all of my heart.

1315
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,112
But he's...

1316
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:00,445
You know his family,
growing up...

1317
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:04,202
He had nothing, and so he was
always looking over the fence

1318
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,079
because he wanted
a better life.

1319
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:10,960
And that's why he worked
four jobs at once,

1320
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:13,496
so that he could put
himself through school.

1321
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:15,255
And he's amazing.

1322
00:56:15,414 --> 00:56:18,258
I mean,
nobody can do that.

1323
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,337
But the problem is,

1324
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:26,759
now that he has everything,
he can't turn it off.

1325
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,519
And he still wants
more and more

1326
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:33,478
and a second house, and
more kids, and a nicer car

1327
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:37,986
and anything that he thinks
is going to make him happy.

1328
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:40,318
And so he just
keeps working

1329
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:42,658
and he's not paying
any attention to me.

1330
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:45,035
And I'm miserable.
Oh, God.

1331
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:49,198
Because... I have huge feet.
(SOBBING)

1332
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:50,957
They're size 11.

1333
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:55,379
My foot has grown a half
a size with each baby.

1334
00:56:55,537 --> 00:57:00,338
I have to go to this weird
online shoe store to get shoes.

1335
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:03,595
And I just want him
to pay attention to me.

1336
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:05,631
And I want him
to grab me

1337
00:57:05,714 --> 00:57:08,638
and kiss me
like he used to.

1338
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,763
And it's like
you always say,

1339
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:15,399
Dave is a little
bit of a pussy.

1340
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:19,019
I always say that?

1341
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:20,604
Yeah.

1342
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:23,194
I always say that
because it's true.

1343
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:26,952
Dave is a little
bit of a pussy.

1344
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,953
I hope that when
he makes partner,

1345
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:32,742
he can just finally
stop and see...

1346
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:35,411
And be happy,
you know?

1347
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:38,171
Because how can you
stay married to somebody

1348
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:40,879
who is incapable
of being happy?

1349
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,470
What are you saying?

1350
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:50,601
(EXCLAIMS) Holy fuck-knuckles,
I've got freckles on my taint.

1351
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:52,136
How awesome is that?

1352
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,896
Hey, fag,
what are you doing here?

1353
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:56,648
Three days to three weeks?

1354
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,605
You left the kids
at daycare?

1355
00:57:58,684 --> 00:57:59,936
Come, on, Mitch!
Those are my kids.

1356
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:01,194
I can't do
this shit any more.

1357
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:03,071
No, no, no.
You are going do this shit.

1358
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:04,277
You don't get
off that easy.

1359
00:58:04,356 --> 00:58:05,778
My marriage is falling apart,
my job is on the line.

1360
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:08,155
You are going to be the best
possible me you can be right now.

1361
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,241
Dave, you don't understand.
I cannot do this.

1362
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,867
Not even for another hour.
You're gonna do it.

1363
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:13,790
I don't care! You're going to
stay here and do this right!

1364
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:17,039
Get out of my fucking way, or I'll
drown you in your own goddamn tub!

1365
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:18,628
Easy, motherfucker!

1366
00:58:18,704 --> 00:58:19,671
If you leave now...
Get your hands off me.

1367
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:20,747
...This friendship is over!

1368
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:21,964
Fuck you.
Don't pull that shit on me.

1369
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:24,050
I got to get the fuck out of here.
I'm serious, Mitch. Shut up!

1370
00:58:24,126 --> 00:58:27,221
Jamie and the kids
mean everything to me.

1371
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:29,555
There's no walking
out on this.

1372
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:32,054
For once in your life, you got
to see something through.

1373
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,218
What the fuck
does that mean?

1374
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:35,262
I'm going to be honest
with you, Mitch,

1375
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:37,352
because there's
a lot on the line here.

1376
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:39,307
You are a quitter.

1377
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:42,273
But quitting is not an
option on this one, okay?

1378
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:43,653
You focus,
you find it.

1379
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:47,533
I don't care where, but you find
it inside of yourself, okay?

1380
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:49,489
I know it's there.

1381
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:51,449
It's not like
I'm not trying.

1382
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:54,114
I just don't know how to
do all your grown-up crap.

1383
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:57,118
You're going to learn.

1384
00:58:57,701 --> 00:59:00,796
This is called a suit.
You wear one every day.

1385
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:05,425
Along with a necktie.
Black, not white, socks.

1386
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:08,258
Dress shoes, not shower sandals.
Please. These are awful.

1387
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,764
And, of course, underwear.
Oh, come on.

1388
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:12,469
(EXCLAIMS) No more
commando, Mitch,

1389
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:13,641
you're a grown-ass man.
Put them on.

1390
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,052
This is called
a schedule.

1391
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:16,394
It tells you everything
you need to do each day.

1392
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:17,767
Pick-u ps, drop-offs,
activities,

1393
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:19,185
play-dates,
doctor's appointments, etc.

1394
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:22,226
You'll notice that there are approximately
50 hours' worth of obligations

1395
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,440
on any given day.
Make it work.

1396
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:26,526
This is called
a grocery store.

1397
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:29,567
People buy food here.
It's part of your responsibilities.

1398
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:30,817
Before heading
to the market,

1399
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:32,528
always call Jamie and ask her
if she needs anything first.

1400
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:33,828
In fact, before making
any decision

1401
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:35,239
in your life,
no matter how small,

1402
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:37,078
call your wife first.

1403
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,288
Think of yourself as
a brain-damaged mule,

1404
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:41,419
lost in the desert,
helpless, dumb

1405
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:42,587
and in constant
need of direction.

1406
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:45,090
Never take the initiative,
never strike out on your own,

1407
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:47,250
and never deviate
from the plan. Why?

1408
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,169
Because you are
a brain-damaged mule

1409
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:51,509
and you are lost
in the damn desert!

1410
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:54,011
These are called children,
or dependants.

1411
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:55,596
Never disparage
your own child.

1412
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:56,972
Everything they do
is a miracle from God.

1413
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,557
When they're bad,
it's only because

1414
00:59:58,637 --> 01:00:00,139
they're tired or
going through a phase.

1415
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:02,558
When other kids are bad, it's
because of indulgent parenting

1416
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:04,942
or innate defects in
the child's character.

1417
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:07,608
Be 15 minutes
early for everything.

1418
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:09,944
It doesn't matter what it is.
A meeting, an event.

1419
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:11,825
Less stress for me,
less stress for you...

1420
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:13,985
Hey! You're married
now, jackass.

1421
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:15,161
You can't look
at other women.

1422
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,617
You can't talk
to other women.

1423
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,073
You can't even be interesting
around other women.

1424
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:20,201
(SHUSHING) Do everything in your
power to desexualize yourself.

1425
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:22,415
Wear a fanny pack,
drive a Prius,

1426
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:24,921
attach electronic devices to
your belt, whatever it takes.

1427
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:26,293
And if you find yourself
forced to talk to a woman,

1428
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:28,091
quickly find a way to mention
the fact that you're married.

1429
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,167
It doesn't even
have to make sense.

1430
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:32,304
Hi, how are you? Nice weather today.
He's totally fucking married.

1431
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:36,133
So I can't sleep with my wife, I
can't sleep with other women?

1432
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:37,217
What the hell is that?

1433
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,684
Marriage.

1434
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,932
I think that's everything.

1435
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:45,271
You got any
more questions?

1436
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:46,685
Do you ever
have any free time?

1437
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:48,354
Have you listened to
a single word I've said?

1438
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:49,863
There is no free time.

1439
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:51,898
And at the end of the day,
do you know what you get?

1440
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:54,784
A fucking gun with a bullet
to blow my head off with?

1441
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:55,990
Sometimes you wish.

1442
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,070
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

1443
01:00:57,946 --> 01:00:58,947
Hi.

1444
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,620
SABRINA: Did you hear
the good news?

1445
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:04,787
Kinkabe and Amalgamated agreed to go
into binding mediation in two days.

1446
01:01:04,953 --> 01:01:07,331
Hold up. What do you mean?
Two days?

1447
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:12,131
So, I'll have my briefs
on your desk by lunch.

1448
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:13,921
That puts my balls on
your chin by dinner.

1449
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:19,719
That, right there, is Schedule
IV sexual harassment.

1450
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:20,932
Awesome!

1451
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,141
I'm sorry, have we met?

1452
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:26,100
No, we haven't.
I'm Mitch Planko.

1453
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:27,392
Hi, Sabrina McKay.

1454
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:28,606
Hey, Sabrina.

1455
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,021
Hold on.

1456
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:32,901
You two guys should go out.
What?

1457
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:35,192
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, man!

1458
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,076
DAVE: Please stop.
MITCH: You two guys need to go out.

1459
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:39,203
Absolutely,
you two should go out.

1460
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:41,535
You're so single,
Mitch, right?

1461
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:45,373
And you're so fucking white-hot, right?
This body.

1462
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,162
Did you do a lot of
swimming in college?

1463
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:49,172
Don't answer that.
You bet she did.

1464
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:50,753
Oh, my God,
you guys need to go out,

1465
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:52,418
have a nice steak dinner,
do some dancing,

1466
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:55,633
go to a Korean nightclub,
get a belly full of pills.

1467
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:57,638
I don't know what you're into,
but just have some fun.

1468
01:01:57,797 --> 01:02:01,427
What about Ecco on 7th
Street, Saturday at 8:3O?

1469
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:03,349
Great? Great!

1470
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:05,354
He's totally free, so he's
going to meet you there.

1471
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:06,730
Don't fuck on
the roof, though.

1472
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,268
That place has got
this non-resin tar

1473
01:02:09,351 --> 01:02:10,944
that's a bastard
to wash off.

1474
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:13,275
So, just oral.

1475
01:02:13,605 --> 01:02:14,857
Yes, you're thinking
about it.

1476
01:02:15,023 --> 01:02:16,115
She's in.

1477
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:17,696
This is good.

1478
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:20,282
You're going to get me fired!
I swear to God.

1479
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,823
Shut it down.
For one second, you listen to me.

1480
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:24,411
For the first
time in your life,

1481
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:26,493
you're fucking
good-looking, okay?

1482
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:29,379
You're single, you got the right
number of fucking balls in that bag,

1483
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:32,040
and you got the opportunity to nail
number one on your cancer list.

1484
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:33,424
I can't do that.
I'm not doing it.

1485
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:36,803
You need this!
This is fucking dinner with her!

1486
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,263
This is so good.

1487
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,682
I mean, what's going
on between us,

1488
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:44,310
it's just crazy, crazy.

1489
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:46,892
Here's what's crazier, not using it.
(EXHALES)

1490
01:02:47,055 --> 01:02:49,183
Not using it on her.

1491
01:02:49,641 --> 01:02:51,518
You use it for her,
you use it for you,

1492
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:53,653
and maybe a little
bit for me, you know?

1493
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,112
Remind yourself of that.
Remind yourself

1494
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:57,987
of the big, fucking crater you created
right there on Tuesday night.

1495
01:02:58,108 --> 01:02:59,530
Oh, the Tuesday night, again.
I could use that.

1496
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:01,119
She'd fit perfectly in there.
Will you please drop that?

1497
01:03:01,236 --> 01:03:03,659
Every day with the Tuesday night!
Well, it's a big goddamn deal!

1498
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:05,740
You fucked me! You owe me!
Respect my life!

1499
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:07,041
Respect mine.

1500
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,747
Yeah, you respect
your life.

1501
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,166
Fine!
I am proud of you.

1502
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:13,423
Just promise me, you listened
to every word I said.

1503
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:15,128
I heard everything.
Every single syllable, you got it?

1504
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:16,589
Did you hear
everything I said?

1505
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:19,379
Caught a few things.
Yeah, just enough.

01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:21,681
You betcha. You go have
a good time, little girl.

1507

away here, nice and safe.

Why are you calling me?

I just wondered if we can get
together for a little while today.

Boy, it's a work day.
Half an hour.

1520
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:57,384
I look different.
I don't like my outfit today.

1521
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:59,010
Dave, half an hour.

1522
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:01,387
Mitch, Sr. wants to sit down
with Dave Lockwood.

1523
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:03,048
Yeah.
Why?

1524
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:06,138
I need to talk to
you about Mitch.

Good, thank you.

What are we doing here? When was the
last time the two of us saw each other?

1530
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,614
I don't care. Listen.

1531
01:04:19,773 --> 01:04:22,822
I'm getting married to a very
beautiful woman named Pamela.

1532
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:24,326
Her name's Pamela?
Yes.

1533

Wow, you can say "I do"
in English this time.

What?
Is Pamela from America?

1535

Yes.

1536
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:31,705
Anyway...

1537
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:34,037
I'm not going to
have anybody there.

1538
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,589
The only family
I have is Mitch.

1539
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:39,125
I went to his apartment
a couple of days ago

1540
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:41,966
and told him that
Pamela would like him

1541
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:43,342
to say a few words
at the wedding

1542
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:44,597
and that wasn't true.

1543
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:46,929
Truth of the matter is, I would
like him to say a few words,

1544
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:49,515
if he could find it

him at the wedding.

You said you didn't
want him to come.

I did?
Yeah.

You said you were really
embarrassed of him.

I didn't invite him.

I can't believe
I don't remember that.

that you thought

that he would
get hammered

end feels normal.

01:30:13,992 --> 01:30:15,414
Why is my voice
so high?

2058
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:16,494
(LAUGHING)

2059
01:30:31,009 --> 01:30:32,181
WOMAN: Thank you
for coming in today.

2060
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:33,596
My name is Erin Walsh,

2061
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:35,100
and I'll be mediating
your claim.

2062
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:38,767
Any and all agreements made
during this mediation are binding

2063
01:30:38,934 --> 01:30:40,607
and carry with them
the full rights

2064
01:30:40,685 --> 01:30:42,312
and responsibilities
of the law

2065
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:46,529
as stated in Federal
Code 325 A, Section 4.

2066
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:48,360
(INAUDIBLE)

2067
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:52,455
Kinkabe agrees in principle
to the terms of the sale

2068
01:30:52,614 --> 01:30:55,993
and valuates your company
at $625 million.

2069
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:57,877
This is their best
and final offer.

2070
01:31:01,331 --> 01:31:03,550
TED: There is no way
we can make this deal.

2071
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:05,836
FLEMMING: Six-twenty-five
is not the end of the world.

2072
01:31:06,002 --> 01:31:08,630
You've just got to know
when it's time to quit.

2073
01:31:08,797 --> 01:31:11,050
Fuck that noise.
We are not quitting.

2074
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:13,059
I think you can
do better, Ted.

2075
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:14,511
I beg your pardon.

2076
01:31:14,678 --> 01:31:16,305
I don't see anybody
headed for the door.

2077
01:31:16,805 --> 01:31:19,308
This is just like trying to fuck a
Catholic girl who keeps saying,

2078
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:22,227
"No, I don't want to.
I'm really drunk and you're circumcised."

2079
01:31:22,394 --> 01:31:23,816
But she keeps on
making out with you,

2080
01:31:23,895 --> 01:31:25,067
she's not leaving
your Fiero...

2081
01:31:25,230 --> 01:31:26,447
It means she really wants to.

2082
01:31:26,773 --> 01:31:28,571
She just needs
a little bit of a nudge.

2083
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:30,152
A little bit of a coax,
little bit of a tickle.

2084
01:31:30,235 --> 01:31:31,862
Just to rationalize it
to herself, to her God.

2085
01:31:31,945 --> 01:31:33,037
Do you know what I mean?

2086
01:31:34,906 --> 01:31:38,752
No, Dave. We most definitely
do not know what you mean.

2087
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:40,628
Okay. What I mean is,

2088
01:31:40,787 --> 01:31:43,381
they want to spend more, they
just don't know it, all right?

2089
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:44,712
If this really was
their final offer,

2090
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:46,005
they'd be leaving,
but they're not.

2091
01:31:46,084 --> 01:31:48,428
They're sticking around.
They've got more money to spend.

2092
01:31:50,088 --> 01:31:52,432
She wants to unroll that rubber
at the bottom of her purse

2093
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:54,592
that she put in there
three semesters ago.

2094
01:31:58,555 --> 01:32:00,398
How much more do you think
we can get out of them?

2095
01:32:01,391 --> 01:32:02,768
Ten million? Fifteen?

2096
01:32:03,101 --> 01:32:06,776
Pull those panties to the side,
Ted, and take a hundred more.

2097
01:32:07,105 --> 01:32:08,106
What?

2098
01:32:09,065 --> 01:32:12,285
Do not listen to him, Ted.
He is beyond reckless.

2099
01:32:12,444 --> 01:32:15,994
If we make too large a counter
offer, we risk driving them away.

2100
01:32:16,156 --> 01:32:17,578
Ted, it doesn't hurt to ask.

2101
01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:19,371
You would not
believe the nasty shit

2102
01:32:19,451 --> 01:32:20,919
I get these girls to do,
just by asking.

2103
01:32:20,994 --> 01:32:22,667
Honestly, it's revolting.

2104
01:32:24,998 --> 01:32:26,921
It does seem odd that
they're not leaving.

2105
01:32:27,083 --> 01:32:28,585
Punch her in the seat.

2106
01:32:36,634 --> 01:32:39,353
You can tell Kinkabe we
want an extra 100 million.

2107
01:32:39,512 --> 01:32:42,265
And that is our final offer,
because we're leaving.

2108
01:32:42,432 --> 01:32:43,649
Fuel the jet, let's go.

2109
01:32:53,443 --> 01:32:55,912
For the record, I did not support
that decision. (ERIN SHOUTING)

2110
01:32:55,987 --> 01:32:56,988
Sir!

2111
01:33:00,158 --> 01:33:03,287
Sir, Mr. Kinkabe has
agreed to $725 million.

2112
01:33:03,453 --> 01:33:04,500
The deal is closed!

2113
01:33:04,621 --> 01:33:06,043
(WHOOPING)

2114
01:33:06,122 --> 01:33:07,123
Oh, my God!

(ALL CHEERING)

2116
01:33:13,171 --> 01:33:14,172
What did I tell you?

(ALL CHATTERING)

(EXCLAIMING)
Oh, my God!

2121
01:33:35,527 --> 01:33:38,076
Oh, my God!

2122
01:33:38,279 --> 01:33:39,280
Wow.

2123
01:33:39,364 --> 01:33:40,536
Are you glad
you came now?

2124
01:33:40,698 --> 01:33:42,951
Am I glad I came?
It's like the greatest day of my life!

2125
01:33:43,034 --> 01:33:44,251
(LAUGHING)
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

2126
01:33:44,327 --> 01:33:45,704
Where did that come from?

2127
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:48,589
Hang on, hang on,
I got it.

2128
01:33:48,748 --> 01:33:50,921
Oh, no, they are
going to call it.

2129
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:54,887
MITCH: Man, this is amazing.
I can't believe they're making me partner.

2130
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:56,548
I'm the greatest
lawyer, ever.

2131
01:33:56,714 --> 01:33:58,216
What a day. (LAUGHS)

2132
01:33:59,551 --> 01:34:01,394
So, now you can be happy.

2133
01:34:01,553 --> 01:34:02,725
Do you think they are
going to give me a medal?

2134
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:05,022
Could you imagine
an engraved sword?

2135
01:34:05,181 --> 01:34:07,434
Honestly, I'd be happy
with anything engraved.

2136
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,728
A sword or a spear.

2137
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:11,066
Even a shield
would be good.

2138
01:34:11,229 --> 01:34:14,358
Slap it, Cara. Cara.

2139
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:16,697
FLEMMING: We are
gathered here tonight

2140
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:20,205
to celebrate the newest
partner in our esteemed firm.

2141
01:34:20,363 --> 01:34:22,491
David Andrew Lockwood

2142
01:34:22,574 --> 01:34:25,874
was born on March 25th, 1974.

2143
01:34:26,035 --> 01:34:28,379
By all accounts,
Dave was a sweet,

2144
01:34:28,496 --> 01:34:30,874
diligent,
hardworking little boy.

2145
01:34:32,041 --> 01:34:33,884
(LAUGHING)

2146
01:34:36,087 --> 01:34:37,134
Wow.

2147
01:34:37,213 --> 01:34:38,635
Yeah, I know.

2148
01:34:38,798 --> 01:34:39,924
I love it.

2149
01:34:40,425 --> 01:34:41,426
Why?

2150
01:34:42,302 --> 01:34:43,303
It reminds me
of high school.

2151
01:34:43,469 --> 01:34:46,393
I feel like I'm about
to lose my virginity.

2152
01:34:46,556 --> 01:34:47,603
(LAUGHS) Bathroom?

2153
01:34:47,765 --> 01:34:49,438
Yeah, right there.

2154
01:34:50,768 --> 01:34:52,111
(MOUTHING)

2155
01:34:56,524 --> 01:34:58,026
Do you want
a drink or something?

2156
01:34:58,193 --> 01:35:00,491
(STAMMERS) Or warm clothes
or I can get you a drink?

2157
01:35:00,653 --> 01:35:02,030
No, it's okay.
We'll have one after.

2158
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:05,784
Okay. After what?

2159
01:35:06,075 --> 01:35:09,045
Relax, Mitch, you're going to
get laid tonight. (LAUGHS)

2160
01:35:09,621 --> 01:35:13,967
FLEMMING: In high school, Dave
graduated first in his class.

2161
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:17,129
After winning a full
scholarship to Princeton,

2162
01:35:17,295 --> 01:35:21,516
Dave, amazingly,
graduated in just three years.

2163
01:35:22,508 --> 01:35:26,229
And after graduating from
Yale Law School with honors,

2164
01:35:26,679 --> 01:35:28,977
Dave clerked
for Justice Souter

2165
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:31,438
on the United
States Supreme Court.

2166
01:35:34,771 --> 01:35:35,988
Work is hard.

2167
01:35:36,147 --> 01:35:38,400
I like going
to baseball games

2168
01:35:38,566 --> 01:35:41,490
and drinking too much, and getting
tattoos at 3:00 in the morning.

2169
01:35:42,278 --> 01:35:43,325
Yeah.

2170
01:35:43,488 --> 01:35:46,287
Boot. Take it off.

2171
01:35:49,994 --> 01:35:53,464
We were not put on this earth
to work, breed and die.

2172
01:35:53,623 --> 01:35:55,375
No, we were not...
Don't interrupt me, handsome.

2173
01:35:56,376 --> 01:35:59,095
We are here
to have fun.

2174
01:35:59,337 --> 01:36:01,180
Right?
Yeah.

2175
01:36:03,383 --> 01:36:04,384
Boot.

2176
01:36:07,971 --> 01:36:10,394
I just think there's
too many rules.

2177
01:36:11,557 --> 01:36:14,811
Think about all the amazing
experiences that we miss out on

2178
01:36:14,978 --> 01:36:17,401
because we're so worried about
what other people will think.

2179
01:36:18,064 --> 01:36:21,785
Why can't I be a professional,
successful woman

2180
01:36:21,943 --> 01:36:24,867
who sleeps with
someone she just met?

2181
01:36:25,321 --> 01:36:26,618
You know?

2182
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:28,124
I haven't heard
a word you said

2183
01:36:28,199 --> 01:36:29,826
since you took
your pants off.

2184
01:36:30,285 --> 01:36:31,286
Shirt.

2185
01:36:32,704 --> 01:36:33,705
Shirt.

2186
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:37,834
You smell like lemons.

2187
01:36:38,918 --> 01:36:40,841
(LAUGHS) I do
smell like lemons.

2188
01:36:41,421 --> 01:36:43,844
Oh, God, you're nervous.
I like that.

2189
01:36:45,591 --> 01:36:46,888
Your leg is shaking.

2190
01:36:47,051 --> 01:36:48,098
That's not my leg.

2191
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:50,559
Take off my bra.

2192
01:36:50,722 --> 01:36:51,723
All Of it?

2193
01:36:51,889 --> 01:36:53,357
Just the parts
covering the breasts.

2194
01:36:53,516 --> 01:36:55,268
That's a good start.

2195
01:36:56,811 --> 01:36:58,905
(DAVE GRUNTS)

2196
01:37:00,982 --> 01:37:02,655
Oh, that's great.

2197
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:04,861
At the end of the day...

2198
01:37:05,028 --> 01:37:06,029
Holy shit!

2199
01:37:06,195 --> 01:37:08,664
...I am just tired of
over-thinking things.

2200
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:10,833
I'm tired of
over-thinking things, too.

2201
01:37:10,992 --> 01:37:13,120
We should just do
what we want to do.

2202
01:37:13,286 --> 01:37:14,663
Let's do it.
Let's just do it.

2203

FLEMMING: The only thing Dave
loves more than the law

2204
01:37:18,041 --> 01:37:20,840
is his beautiful wife, Jamie.

2205
01:37:21,377 --> 01:37:23,755
Their life is
like a fairy tale

2206
01:37:23,921 --> 01:37:27,300
made even more perfect by their
three adorable children.

2207
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:30,554
(DISTANTLY) So, as we celebrate
one partnership tonight...

2208
01:37:41,064 --> 01:37:42,907
Look, Daddy,
it's you and me.

(INDISTINCT)

2210
01:37:54,869 --> 01:37:57,622
...would bring most
men to their knees,

2211
01:37:57,789 --> 01:37:59,132
but not Dave.

2212
01:37:59,707 --> 01:38:01,801
He excelled on all fronts,

2213
01:38:01,959 --> 01:38:03,586
putting the rest
of us to shame.

2214
01:38:04,712 --> 01:38:05,713
I didn't earn this.

2215
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:10,101
The /aw may be the first
thing on Dave's mind,

2216
01:38:10,259 --> 01:38:14,639
but his family has always been
the first thing in his heart.

2217
01:38:16,057 --> 01:38:17,650
What should we do
with each other, Mitch?

2218
01:38:17,809 --> 01:38:19,106
Oh, God, everything.

2219
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:20,311
(LAUGHS)

2220
01:38:20,436 --> 01:38:21,779
We could...

2221
01:38:25,108 --> 01:38:26,109
Is that a...

2222
01:38:37,328 --> 01:38:39,171
Is that a many-spotted
skipperling?

2223
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:40,581
Yeah.

2224
01:38:45,628 --> 01:38:46,754
Mmm.

2225
01:38:47,672 --> 01:38:50,346
You can have
whatever you want.

2226
01:38:54,303 --> 01:38:55,520

Mitch, you came.

2404
01:48:46,812 --> 01:48:48,314
I'm very, very touched.
Thank you.

2405
01:48:48,564 --> 01:48:49,565
You're welcome, Dad.

2406

This must be my new mom.

Hi, Mitch Planko.

2409
01:48:55,446 --> 01:48:57,039
Good. Thank you.

Keep away from him.
The man's a pervert.

ALL: Happy anniversary,
Jamie and Dave!

For those of you who don't know
me, my name is Mitch Planko.

I was that nut sack's

Here we go.

2417
01:49:22,181 --> 01:49:26,231
When we were kids, Dave and I,
we had a lot of big plans.

2418
01:49:26,393 --> 01:49:28,771
Dave, he was going
to be an astronaut,

2419
01:49:28,937 --> 01:49:32,987
and I was going to sell
dolphins on the black market.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
(SCOFFS) Astronaut!

2421
01:49:34,651 --> 01:49:36,870
There's a reason I'm
not selling dolphins.

2422
01:49:37,279 --> 01:49:40,032
We live in Atlanta,
they're tough to find.

2423
01:49:40,199 --> 01:49:43,248
And those things,
they don't sleep,

2424
01:49:43,410 --> 01:49:45,208
which also makes it
real hard to catch them.

2425
01:49:46,371 --> 01:49:48,624
But I think
that we all know

2426
01:49:48,791 --> 01:49:52,466
that life doesn't always turn
out exactly how you plan it.

it turns out better.

2430
01:49:58,425 --> 01:49:59,768
Dave, /think
there's a reason

2431
01:49:59,843 --> 01:50:01,845
that you're not wa/king
on the moon right now.

2432
01:50:02,304 --> 01:50:04,602
