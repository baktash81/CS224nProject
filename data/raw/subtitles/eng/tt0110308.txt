1
00:01:30,127 --> 00:01:34,419
I expect to see that on your income tax Marty.
I can't hear you people!

2
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:36,683
You maggots sound like suburbanites.

3
00:01:36,974 --> 00:01:40,474
Fifty bucks for a lousy coin set,
you sell one at a time?

4
00:01:40,974 --> 00:01:44,264
And a hundred bucks for the next
sucker who makes a triple sale.

5
00:01:48,554 --> 00:01:52,972
A minute 50 seconds Bernie.
D'you expect these leads to grow on fucking trees ?

6
00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:56,345
Want me over your shoulder all day Bernie, huh?

7
00:01:57,263 --> 00:02:00,260
Ask for the sale four times every time, got it?

8
00:02:30,836 --> 00:02:33,003
You got twenty seconds to close it, Bernie.

9
00:02:33,337 --> 00:02:36,211
Fifteen...
I'm on your tail, Bernie.

10
00:02:36,503 --> 00:02:39,002
Five... Four...
...at a price that would be stupid to pass up.

11
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:42,501
You'd have to be brain dead. Yeah. How many sets do you want?

12
00:02:50,499 --> 00:02:52,208
- You got the shit, man?
- Yep.

13
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,582
Hey, well give it up, bro.

14
00:02:59,206 --> 00:03:01,996
As ordered.
Pharmaceutical cocaine.

15
00:03:02,371 --> 00:03:05,788
Come on you eunuchs!
Zeke's closing his suckers six, seven times,

16
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:09,579
and he's got twice as many sales as the rest of you bastards.

17
00:03:10,163 --> 00:03:12,787
You'll spend your Sunday here too
if you don't take these bills from me.

18
00:03:25,951 --> 00:03:27,366
Oh, shit.

19
00:03:29,157 --> 00:03:30,950
Of course, of course.

20
00:03:31,447 --> 00:03:35,157
What a stupid mistake.
Go ahead!

21
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:46,238
Ah, we have a winner. Jerry...
Who'd have thought? What'll it be, Jer?

22
00:03:46,613 --> 00:03:51,403
Hundred bucks, or a thousand dollars
worth of rare commemorative coins? Hmm?

23
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:55,026
You think I'm from Jersey?

24
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:56,735
Wise man.

25
00:03:57,026 --> 00:03:59,318
Ah, christ; a charmed life.

26
00:04:04,108 --> 00:04:07,025
Go on! Go on!

27
00:04:54,347 --> 00:04:54,930
Clay ?

28
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:09,134
Bridget, it's me. They moved it back.
I'll be home when I can.

29
00:05:29,423 --> 00:05:34,381
People saw flames shooting from the building, called the fire department.
By the time the engine got here it was too late,

30
00:05:35,088 --> 00:05:38,003
and there were five dead young people.

31
00:05:55,874 --> 00:05:56,665
How'd it go?

32
00:05:57,956 --> 00:05:59,081
Did you get the money?

33
00:06:00,165 --> 00:06:00,875
Did you?

34
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:12,954
You walk the streets like that?

35
00:06:18,036 --> 00:06:18,662
You're an idiot.

36
00:06:28,534 --> 00:06:30,826
Bridget, I didn't mean that.

37
00:06:33,908 --> 00:06:38,407
Hey, I'm still hung up honey.
These are very scary people.

38
00:06:41,323 --> 00:06:42,531
Forgive me. Hmm?

39
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:45,614
I'll make it up to you.

40
00:06:47,405 --> 00:06:51,112
You can hit me. Anywhere. Hard.

41
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:57,777
Oh, baby, baby, baby - let's not fight, right?

42
00:06:58,194 --> 00:07:02,776
This is our penthouse.
This is the key to the real city.

43
00:07:03,276 --> 00:07:07,985
This is what you wanted.
This is what we've been working for.

44
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,274
Seven hundred thousand.

45
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:20,272
This was a mistake.

46
00:07:20,564 --> 00:07:23,770
This is just to take care of us during our residency

47
00:07:24,062 --> 00:07:27,271
until the Doctor bucks start rolling in, right?

48
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:29,061
They're soft.
I thought they'd be stiff.

49
00:07:30,854 --> 00:07:35,644
These are laundered! Untraceable.
Perfectly safe, right?

50
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:43,142
We have to put them somewhere.

51
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:50,015
You are a criminal mastermind!

52
00:07:50,431 --> 00:07:51,724
It's just a hobby.

53
00:07:52,724 --> 00:07:55,639
I wanna pay off that loan shark first thing
tomorrow morning.

54
00:07:55,931 --> 00:07:57,515
Oh, maybe he'll forget.

55
00:07:57,929 --> 00:08:00,638
A hundred grand plus interest?
I doubt it.

56
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:02,013
Stop.

57
00:08:02,304 --> 00:08:05,429
You gotta give a little love.

58
00:08:10,593 --> 00:08:12,093
Somethin' wrong?

59
00:08:13,885 --> 00:08:14,801
Fear.

60
00:08:16,592 --> 00:08:20,385
I'm gonna take a long hot one and then
you and I are gonna celebrate.

61
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,674
Worth the risk, huh?

62
00:08:31,464 --> 00:08:33,590
What do you wanna do tonight?

63
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,672
Go to the opera,
or some kinda big Broadway show?

64
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:42,961
Fine dining experience?

65
00:08:45,045 --> 00:08:46,170
Whatever you want.

66
00:09:28,326 --> 00:09:30,700
Hey Bridge, do we have any shampoo?

67
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,281
How are we supposed to celebrate?

68
00:09:59,651 --> 00:10:01,277
Hey, Bridge?

69
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,149
Bridget!

70
00:10:31,312 --> 00:10:33,145
You better run!

71
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:58,210


72
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,835


73
00:12:04,915 --> 00:12:06,500
Where the fuck am I?

74
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:07,998
Beston.

75
00:12:09,624 --> 00:12:10,915
How far is Chicago?

76
00:12:11,707 --> 00:12:15,123
Oh, ten, twelve hours.
Depends on how fast you drive.

77
00:12:29,701 --> 00:12:30,994
What's that bar like?

78
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:07,151
Hey, thanks a lot Mike.

79
00:13:08,152 --> 00:13:11,234
- What, did Clarence make you beg?
- I made him beg.

80
00:13:12,652 --> 00:13:14,234
So why all the attitude?

81
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:16,234
I guess Mike didn't want his job back.

82
00:13:16,525 --> 00:13:20,606
I just didn't want to come back to this dead end town, that's all.

83
00:13:21,024 --> 00:13:23,232
So you, you wanna talk about it or...?

84
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:28,105
There's nothing to talk about.
I went to Buffalo, it didn't work out. I'm back.

85
00:13:28,606 --> 00:13:30,521
We already know all that.

86
00:13:30,814 --> 00:13:34,397
- I guess he didn't want to talk about it.
- I guess not.

87
00:13:35,604 --> 00:13:36,603
Hi guys.

88
00:13:38,103 --> 00:13:39,104
Hi, Mike.

89
00:13:41,602 --> 00:13:43,894
Hi Stacy. How are you?

90
00:13:44,311 --> 00:13:45,686
- Good, you?
- Good.

91
00:13:45,977 --> 00:13:47,893
Hi Stacy. How are you?

92
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,684
Grow up!

93
00:13:56,265 --> 00:13:58,182
What? Did you leave your dick in Buffalo?

94
00:13:58,391 --> 00:14:00,057
Chris, these women are anchors.

95
00:14:00,558 --> 00:14:01,058
They're what?

96
00:14:01,891 --> 00:14:05,265
They're planted here. You get too close to one,
Beston's got you for life.

97
00:14:05,556 --> 00:14:07,846
Yeah, yeah. Here he goes again.

98
00:14:08,471 --> 00:14:10,264
How many guys in this bar have felt her up?

99
00:14:12,054 --> 00:14:12,762
All of 'em.

100
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,845
And how many have gone home with her - how many have slept with her?

101
00:14:18,845 --> 00:14:20,053
None, including yourself.

102
00:14:20,553 --> 00:14:21,969
Right. I rest my case.

103
00:14:22,468 --> 00:14:24,343
Don't rest it too long 'cos I promise you it'll fall off.

104
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,758
How do I look, do I look alright?
Do you like this?

105
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:31,926
You look great.

106
00:14:37,217 --> 00:14:38,631
Hey, Stacy.

107
00:14:38,922 --> 00:14:40,631
- Hey, Chris.
- How you doin'?

108
00:14:43,922 --> 00:14:47,338
- So, er, tell me about the wife.
- What ?

109
00:14:48,797 --> 00:14:50,921
The wife, man.
Copper wedding band.

110
00:14:51,212 --> 00:14:54,627
- Was it a kind of spur-of-the-moment decision or what?
- I can't get this off.

111
00:14:58,793 --> 00:15:02,002
Use a little octane man, take care of it.

112
00:15:04,502 --> 00:15:08,209
- I just never took you as the impulsive type.
- Neither did I.

113
00:15:10,582 --> 00:15:11,291
Did you divorce her?

114
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,666
I'll get around to it.

115
00:15:18,872 --> 00:15:21,873
I cannot spend the rest of my life here.

116
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:24,163
I know what's gonna happen each and every day.

117
00:15:26,954 --> 00:15:28,078
So when do you leave?

118
00:15:29,953 --> 00:15:32,370
How long does it take to grow a new set of balls?

119
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:43,366
Gimme a Manhattan.

120
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:03,446
I know you hear me, pal.

121
00:16:05,403 --> 00:16:09,236
Anybody need anything down here?
Everybody good?

122
00:16:12,194 --> 00:16:14,110
Jesus Christ. Who's a girl gotta suck around here to get a drink?

123
00:16:19,026 --> 00:16:21,191
City trash, right? You don't take that?

124
00:16:22,108 --> 00:16:23,485
What do you see in her?

125
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,316
Maybe a new set of balls.

126
00:16:28,607 --> 00:16:32,397
- Gimme a Manhattan!
- Ray, a Manhattan for the lady please.

127
00:16:35,898 --> 00:16:36,689
Sure, Mike.

128
00:16:40,688 --> 00:16:42,894
What - that's the game? I gotta say please?

129
00:16:43,186 --> 00:16:47,685
Er, yes, it helps.
You're not from around here?

130
00:16:49,352 --> 00:16:50,353
Fuck off.

131
00:16:56,769 --> 00:16:59,141
- Two dollars, please.
- I got it Ray.

132
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:04,641
Thanks, Mike.

133
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,432
I er, I took care of that for you.

134
00:17:14,222 --> 00:17:16,722
"Thank you" can also be very effective.

135
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,345
Could you leave?

136
00:17:19,512 --> 00:17:20,428
Please.

137
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,344
Well I haven't finished charming you yet.

138
00:17:23,636 --> 00:17:25,929
- You haven't started.
- Give me a chance.

139
00:17:27,162 --> 00:17:32,326
Go find yourself a nice little cow-girl, 
make nice little cow-babies and leave me alone.

140
00:17:36,425 --> 00:17:40,008
I'm er, I'm hung like a horse.
Think about it.

141
00:17:45,213 --> 00:17:46,298
Let's see.

142
00:17:47,089 --> 00:17:49,880
- Excuse me?
- Mister Ed, let's see.

143
00:17:50,714 --> 00:17:53,005
- Look, I tried to be nice.
I can see that something in...

144
00:17:55,796 --> 00:17:58,295
I can be very nice when I try.

145
00:17:58,796 --> 00:17:59,877
Sit down.

146
00:18:03,587 --> 00:18:07,293
Maybe we just got off to a bad start.
I know Ray's put plenty of people in...

147
00:18:09,084 --> 00:18:10,167
What are you... What are you doing?

148
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:13,584
I believe what we're looking for has a certain horse-like quality.

149
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,040
- Are you serious?
- Never buy anything sight-unseen.

150
00:18:19,664 --> 00:18:21,165
Uh-huh. That's a good policy.

151
00:18:24,748 --> 00:18:26,164
How many lovers?

152
00:18:26,956 --> 00:18:29,749
- What? Do I get extra credit points for experience?
- How many lovers?

153
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:34,620
Thirteen... Tw-tw-Twelve.

154
00:18:35,327 --> 00:18:36,620
- Any prostitutes?
- No.

155
00:18:36,954 --> 00:18:39,327
- Any men?
- No. No men.

156
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:48,825
- Am I approved?
- Medically.

157
00:18:50,117 --> 00:18:51,408
- You have your own place?
- Yes.

158
00:18:51,824 --> 00:18:53,200
- Is it a sty?
- No, it's clean.

159
00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:54,533
Do you have indoor plumbing?

160
00:18:54,849 --> 00:18:58,349
Yes, I have indoor plumbing, 
 I have electricity and I have a name.

161
00:18:58,615 --> 00:19:00,615
No names.
Meet me outside.

162

164
00:19:34,648 --> 00:19:36,149
Frank Griffith please.

165
00:19:41,688 --> 00:19:42,272
Hi.

166
00:19:43,771 --> 00:19:45,271
It's a local call.

167
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:53,143
It's personal.

168
00:20:07,516 --> 00:20:08,662
Bridget.

169
00:20:09,432 --> 00:20:12,599
- Always a pleasure.
- You still a lawyer Frank?

170
00:20:12,724 --> 00:20:15,056
Yeah, you still a self-serving bitch?

171
00:20:16,932 --> 00:20:19,178
A friend needs advice.
I'll set it up for you:

172
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:22,700
A husband and wife do a one-time drug deal 
- the goal's a wholesome one.

173
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,888
College fund for the kids?

174
00:20:26,387 --> 00:20:30,636
No. The wife wants new digs.
Comes off without a hitch,

175
00:20:30,803 --> 00:20:34,092
only the wife decides that the new house
 would be happier without the husband.

176
00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:36,196
Sharing was never her speciality.

177
00:20:36,593 --> 00:20:37,801
She's anxious to start spending.

178
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:41,593
Well, it's just an opinion since you're not paying for it,

179
00:20:41,968 --> 00:20:44,590
but the husband is entitled to half of
whatever you buy with that cash,

180
00:20:44,882 --> 00:20:49,174
in fact as soon as you turn it into a legal asset
like a condo or a house or a bank account

181
00:20:49,589 --> 00:20:50,880
he can make a claim on it.

182
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:52,089
What are you saying?

183
00:20:52,381 --> 00:20:54,006
My lips moving too fast for you?

184
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,546
Not fast enough, as I recall.

185
00:20:57,963 --> 00:20:59,464
Now, now! Keep it in cash.

186
00:20:59,754 --> 00:21:04,755
He's not gonna ask a judge for half of that unless he wants
to spend 20 years in Attica with somebody's dick up his ass.

187
00:21:05,962 --> 00:21:07,335
So, what - hold onto it for how long?

188
00:21:08,168 --> 00:21:11,835
Well, as long as it takes to er,
finalise the divorce.

189
00:21:12,126 --> 00:21:13,834
How long does that take?

190
00:21:14,627 --> 00:21:16,834
He'll fight it - maybe 2 years.
Less if you're lucky.

191
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:18,751
Jesus, Frank.

192
00:21:19,043 --> 00:21:23,748
Well I'm sorry the law doesn't make it more 
convenient foryou to steal and deal drugs, Bridget!

193
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:25,831
OK, start the divorce.

194
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:27,624
Well that's gonna cost you
 - it's a lot of paperwork.

195
00:21:28,415 --> 00:21:30,831
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fill in the blanks for me
- I'm out of town.

196
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,121
Where are you?

197
00:21:33,538 --> 00:21:34,705
Maybury.

198
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,703
I'm going to Chicago to see an old friend.

199
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:39,330
Well that is the first place Clay'd expect you to go.
Stay put.

200
00:21:39,912 --> 00:21:41,411
You can't be serious?

201
00:21:41,827 --> 00:21:44,411
Look, maybe he won't stall.
Can he afford a good lawyer?

202
00:21:44,702 --> 00:21:45,786
Not any more.

203
00:21:47,493 --> 00:21:48,703
How silly of me to ask! Bye.

204
00:21:55,074 --> 00:21:56,699


205
00:22:14,071 --> 00:22:15,071
Hey, wait up!

206
00:22:19,653 --> 00:22:21,445
Hey, where you going?

207
00:22:43,648 --> 00:22:44,313
Morning.

208
00:23:03,603 --> 00:23:04,310
Morning.

209
00:23:07,893 --> 00:23:09,183
Morning! Beautiful day, isn't it?

210
00:23:13,515 --> 00:23:16,099
Now boys, slow down!
Wait for me.

211
00:23:42,177 --> 00:23:45,675


212
00:23:51,257 --> 00:23:53,049
I can't believe our good fortune.

213
00:23:53,341 --> 00:23:56,757
The fella we were about to go with
wasn't half as qualified.

214
00:24:01,129 --> 00:24:02,921
Oh, you also have to sign here.

215
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,213
Nice trick.

216
00:24:09,629 --> 00:24:11,710
I erm, I still have one concern.

217
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:15,002
I'll handle your records personally.

218
00:24:15,336 --> 00:24:17,209
No-one else in the company 
will know you as Bridget Gregory.

219
00:24:17,626 --> 00:24:19,501
So there's no way 
your husband can find you.

220
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,333
I appreciate it, Bob.

221
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:25,917
He actually beat you?

222
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,999
Savagely.

223
00:24:31,581 --> 00:24:32,789
That's horrible.

224
00:24:35,914 --> 00:24:37,704
Well. Have you decided 
what we'll be calling you?

225
00:24:41,705 --> 00:24:43,870
Erm... Kroy. Wen-dy.

226
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,287
- Wendy Kroy.
- Good.

227
00:24:46,994 --> 00:24:47,994
With a K.

228
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,784
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

229
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,158
- I work here! What are you doing here?
- You don't know me.

230
00:25:00,449 --> 00:25:04,158
I've been thinking about you all day.
I can't believe you're here. What are you doing?

231
00:25:04,866 --> 00:25:06,074
What are you doing here?

232
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,740
Look.

233
00:25:13,654 --> 00:25:18,153
If I knew I was gonna be staying in this 
town I would have had nothing to do with you.

234
00:25:18,528 --> 00:25:19,738
Well I'm very flattered! Thank you.

235
00:25:19,946 --> 00:25:25,236
As far as I'm concerned any sex we had
was just a product of your imagination.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

236
00:25:25,945 --> 00:25:29,027
Well I happen to have evidence to the contrary.

237
00:25:31,318 --> 00:25:33,027
What kind of evidence?

238
00:25:33,526 --> 00:25:36,525
The unrolled latex kind of evidence.

239
00:25:36,816 --> 00:25:38,317
That's disgusting.

240
00:25:47,191 --> 00:25:50,522
I work here now.
Don't fuck with my image!

241
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:32,846
- Frank. It's me. I took your advice.
- What advice?

242
00:26:33,137 --> 00:26:37,344
I live here. I work here.
I signed a six-month contract.

243
00:26:37,845 --> 00:26:39,344
You're gonna be there longer than that.

244
00:26:39,637 --> 00:26:42,426
I'm an optimist.
Let me give you the address.

245
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,925
No! I don't wanna know where you are.
I'll tell you who does, though...

246
00:26:46,426 --> 00:26:50,425
He's called three times since he got the paperwork.
Something about a loan shark and his thumb.

247
00:26:50,717 --> 00:26:52,216
Anybody check you for a heartbeat lately?

248
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:55,132
So... What am I supposed to do?

249
00:26:55,425 --> 00:26:57,132
Send him some cash.

250
00:26:58,632 --> 00:27:00,132
Failing that?

251
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,005
Tell him to quit calling me.
I don't need this.

252
00:27:05,797 --> 00:27:06,629
Alright, I'll call him.

253
00:27:08,713 --> 00:27:09,796
Be careful - he might trace it.

254
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:12,297
He's not that clever.

255
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,087
- Whatever you say.
- Bye.

256
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:41,289
This is the operator. I have a person-to-person
call Bridget to Clay. Will you accept the charge?

257
00:27:41,664 --> 00:27:44,371
Is this Bridget in Chicago or Bridget in Dallas?

258
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:46,664
Operator, disconnect this call.

259
00:27:52,161 --> 00:27:53,452
Son of a bitch.

260
00:28:12,616 --> 00:28:15,032
Manhattan... Please... Thankyou.

261
00:28:24,029 --> 00:28:25,320
Well, hello again!

262
00:28:28,404 --> 00:28:30,528
Aren't there any other bars in this town?

263
00:28:30,818 --> 00:28:32,195
Well it's very nice to see you too.

264
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:34,317
I've been looking all over for you.

265
00:28:34,984 --> 00:28:35,818
Oh good.

266
00:28:36,193 --> 00:28:37,901
It's strange though.
None of the other secretaries

267
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:39,484
seem to know who you are.

268
00:28:39,692 --> 00:28:42,274
I'm not a secretary you rural neanderthal.
I'm...

269
00:28:42,608 --> 00:28:46,482
Director of Lead Generation.
I'm just trying to get your attention.

270
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:50,771
That's good.

271
00:29:03,187 --> 00:29:04,062
Don't move.

272
00:29:46,927 --> 00:29:47,802
You're living here now or what?

273
00:29:50,511 --> 00:29:53,299
- For the time being.
- Yeah? Where do I fit in?

274
00:29:55,592 --> 00:29:57,299
Ah, you're my designated fuck.

275
00:29:58,717 --> 00:29:59,508
Designated fuck?

276
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:04,007
Do they make cards for that?
What if I wanna be more than your designated fuck?

277
00:30:05,174 --> 00:30:07,174
I'll designate someone else.

278
00:30:18,961 --> 00:30:22,751
Hey, How about us going out on
an actual date some time, you know?

279
00:30:23,251 --> 00:30:24,169
Why?

280
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:30,042
Where you from?

281
00:30:33,042 --> 00:30:36,168
A galaxy far, far away!

282
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:40,040
I'm just trying to decide whether
you're a total bitch or not.

283
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,330
I'm a total fucking bitch!

284
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:05,118
I'm having more and more trouble with this, Wendy.

285
00:31:05,534 --> 00:31:07,535
Don't worry - you'll get the hang of it.

286
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:13,116
I mean you're keeping me at arm's length all the time,
I'm starting to feel like some kind of a...

287
00:31:13,491 --> 00:31:17,406
- Sex object?
- Yes, exactly - a sex object.

288
00:31:17,699 --> 00:31:18,907
Live it up.

289
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,778
Why don't you just stay over?

290
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,904
Gotta get back.

291
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:31,278
Well then I could come over. That's fine.

292
00:31:31,902 --> 00:31:33,779
My place, my space Mike. Don't get sticky.

293
00:31:34,069 --> 00:31:36,694
What are you so scared of, huh?
What are you so scared of?

294
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,192
I don't know. I...

295
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:45,774
I guess it's because I've been hurt before.

296
00:31:47,566 --> 00:31:50,150
I just... I don't wanna get close to anyone
right now.

297
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:55,773
You're different than the others Mike.
I feel like maybe I could love you.

298
00:31:56,564 --> 00:31:59,356
I just... I don't want that to happen. Really.

299
00:32:00,855 --> 00:32:01,730
Will that do?

300
00:32:04,562 --> 00:32:07,229
Fucking doesn't have to be anything more than fucking.

301
00:32:08,937 --> 00:32:11,227
I'm... I'm not asking for love, alright?

302
00:32:11,853 --> 00:32:12,852
Wise man.

303
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,227
We could talk. You could talk to me.
I'd like to talk!

304
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:17,226
So talk!

305
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,017
Who's listening!

306
00:32:19,225 --> 00:32:22,933
There are things I'd like to know about you Wendy.
I like you.

307
00:32:23,434 --> 00:32:24,935
I would like to know things about you.

308
00:32:31,931 --> 00:32:33,098
Alright, look - you know my name.

309
00:32:33,514 --> 00:32:34,098
Yes.

310
00:32:37,723 --> 00:32:39,013
- I come from...
- New York City.

311
00:32:40,721 --> 00:32:42,886
- How do you know that?
- My phone bill.

312
00:32:44,177 --> 00:32:45,012
Shit.

313
00:32:46,387 --> 00:32:49,094
Look, I like my privacy, OK?

314
00:32:49,887 --> 00:32:50,803
- Let me in.
- No.

315
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:51,970
Please!

316
00:32:53,176 --> 00:32:54,177
Then screw you!

317
00:32:54,885 --> 00:32:57,301
Right. Tomorrow night. 8 O'clock.

318
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,045
I gotta get outta here.

319
00:33:53,332 --> 00:33:54,413
It's me.

320
00:33:57,621 --> 00:34:00,203
Bridget, so glad you called.

321
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,119
You know the phone booth down the block?

322
00:34:06,201 --> 00:34:07,201
Get the number. I'll call you back.

323
00:34:07,701 --> 00:34:09,702
But before you do that I think may...

324
00:34:09,993 --> 00:34:12,493
I won't let you trace this Clay. Run!

325
00:34:19,365 --> 00:34:22,365
Lay it on man, lay it on me! Come on!

326
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:27,156
You're beautiful.

327
00:34:34,571 --> 00:34:35,861
Let it ring.

328
00:34:37,654 --> 00:34:38,945
OK, here we go.

329
00:34:42,444 --> 00:34:43,735
What's the number?

330
00:34:44,236 --> 00:34:46,359
555-5163.

331
00:34:46,858 --> 00:34:49,359
I'll call you right back. It'll be ringing.

332
00:34:57,023 --> 00:34:57,815
You're on, Doc.

333
00:35:40,098 --> 00:35:41,681
Bridge. Where are you?

334
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,471
You need to get back to New York.
It sounds quiet.

335
00:35:49,054 --> 00:35:52,470
Yes. Why don't you come back?

336
00:35:53,263 --> 00:35:55,760
All is forgiven Clay? I don't buy it.

337
00:35:56,051 --> 00:35:58,261
- Give me the money back.
- It's mine. You hit me.

338
00:35:58,551 --> 00:35:59,843
- I slapped you.
- It's mine.

339
00:36:00,552 --> 00:36:05,841
Listen, forget about this 'possession is
90% of the law' crap.

340
00:36:06,759 --> 00:36:09,758
The hundred grand that we borrowed is
a hundred and fifty now and the

341
00:36:10,049 --> 00:36:11,632
private detective from upstairs

342
00:36:11,924 --> 00:36:13,424
has a 50% contingency on the rest,

343
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:17,133
and he wants it very, very bad.

344
00:36:20,338 --> 00:36:25,628
Alright, look. I'll pay off the shark,
throw 10 more to your private detective.

345
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,128
Give me a divorce, we'll be even.

346
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:33,002
You qualify, you're a bitch!

347
00:36:33,336 --> 00:36:35,792
Think Clay - it's the best you can hope for.

348
00:36:38,626 --> 00:36:39,209
I thought you were...

349
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:49,500
Did you get anything? Anything at all?

350
00:36:54,998 --> 00:36:56,205
Area code.

351
00:36:56,705 --> 00:36:57,996
What city?

352
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,287
City?

353
00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:08,785
She's in cow country.

354
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,285
- Frank Griffith's office.
- Is he there? It's Bridget.

355
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,576
- He's on another line.
- I don't care if he's on the other line. This is urgent.

356
00:37:19,951 --> 00:37:21,864
I have other clients, Bridget.

357
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,741
I think he traced my call.
I'm outta here.

358
00:37:25,073 --> 00:37:26,949
Ah, just relax.
How long were you on the phone?

359
00:37:27,156 --> 00:37:30,156
- 45 seconds, maybe less.
- Yeah, well that's not enough time.

360
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,030
It's enough time to pinpoint the region.
Area code maybe.

361
00:37:33,363 --> 00:37:36,946
- Yeah, well time for a new area code.
- Well, most fugitives are caught on the run Bridge.

362
00:37:40,238 --> 00:37:41,737
Frank, don't do this to me.

363
00:37:42,028 --> 00:37:45,320
There are 10 million phone numbers per
area code. You got an alias?

364
00:37:46,027 --> 00:37:49,130
Well then just relax.
Take it easy.

365
00:37:50,527 --> 00:37:51,026
Are you sure?

366
00:37:51,318 --> 00:37:55,817
Yeah, and look, if you're nervous
about staying alone - don't.

367
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,608
- I hope you're right.
- Bye.

368
00:38:38,557 --> 00:38:41,557


369
00:38:44,765 --> 00:38:45,847
Wendy, I'm sorry

370
00:38:46,263 --> 00:38:49,429
I walked in on you in the bathroom, I really am.
What you walking so fast for?

371
00:38:49,763 --> 00:38:53,055
A woman loses 50% of her authority when
people find out who she's sleeping with.

372
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,929
- That's a crock.
- It's a university study.

373
00:38:56,636 --> 00:38:59,927
Great. Listen. This place is not like that OK.
Around here we're not like that.

374
00:39:00,344 --> 00:39:01,344
Time to shut up!

375
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:07,218
Get your hands off me!
What's your problem, Mister?

376
00:39:09,218 --> 00:39:12,216
What is this - the corporate dark ages?
Did you see that?

377
00:39:56,163 --> 00:39:57,372
What are you saying?

378
00:39:57,748 --> 00:40:00,872
I'm saying I don't have anything more to go on.

379
00:40:01,245 --> 00:40:01,955
Damn.

380
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:06,538
Hey. That's my retail business.
Like I got a choice.

381
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:09,037
I don't like being around this.

382
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:12,327
- Who is it?
- I'm here to see the Doctor.

383
00:40:17,326 --> 00:40:18,536
Nice place.

384
00:40:19,661 --> 00:40:20,827
What can I do for you?

385
00:40:21,034 --> 00:40:25,116
I need to lose some weight.
I mean, gotta go on a diet.

386
00:40:27,323 --> 00:40:29,115
Well, ThinFast.

387
00:40:31,325 --> 00:40:32,407
ThinFast.

388
00:40:33,324 --> 00:40:36,323
- What about it?
- You tried it, you asshole!

389
00:40:37,114 --> 00:40:40,030
Oh, right. Didn't work.

390
00:40:43,028 --> 00:40:44,696
I think you'll like this.

391
00:40:53,194 --> 00:40:53,777
Charming business.

392
00:40:53,986 --> 00:40:57,902
Hey, it's just trying to keep up with the interest.
Now, you were saying?

393
00:40:58,276 --> 00:40:59,691
I got no more to go on.

394
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:01,608
What - you aren't quittin' on me are you?

395
00:41:01,899 --> 00:41:06,066
Well you're not payin' my expenses.
I can't afford to go around half the state
carrying her picture, man.

396
00:41:06,399 --> 00:41:08,566
The name Bridget Gregory is ringin'
no bells up there.

397
00:41:08,982 --> 00:41:11,481
- Maybe she changed her name.
- Maybe definitely.

398
00:41:11,773 --> 00:41:14,188
Unless you figure out what she changed it to
we got nothin'.

399
00:41:14,563 --> 00:41:17,355
She wants back here. She wants it bad.

400
00:41:17,689 --> 00:41:21,479
She probably is back here.
Now why don't you tell your friends to watch out for her?

401
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:25,271
If you find her, I'd be glad to separate
her from the cash.

402
00:41:25,561 --> 00:41:27,853
Hey man, you've been big.

403
00:41:30,561 --> 00:41:32,560
You really want to stop it with that.

404
00:41:48,432 --> 00:41:49,848
Harlan !

405
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,305
Wendy Kroy.

406
00:41:58,514 --> 00:42:01,428
It's her name
It's the one she's using now.

407
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:02,803
You're flailing, man.

408
00:42:03,428 --> 00:42:05,718
No, no, no. I know her.

409
00:42:07,218 --> 00:42:08,594
She's got this crazy talent

410
00:42:09,301 --> 00:42:11,303
where she can write backwards.

411
00:42:11,718 --> 00:42:14,217
New York. Backwards.

412
00:42:15,302 --> 00:42:16,300
The city.

413
00:42:17,007 --> 00:42:19,175
It's all she's thinking about.

414
00:42:20,175 --> 00:42:23,007
Wendy Kroy, Wendy Kroy.

415
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:30,965
You are beautiful.

416
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:57,165
- I got your note.
- 5 days ago.

417
00:42:57,458 --> 00:42:59,832
- Apology appreciated.
- Apology expired.

418
00:43:00,124 --> 00:43:04,247
A woman has to protect her standing at
the office. You know that.

419
00:43:05,956 --> 00:43:09,414
Look, I was wrong to touch you but you were
wrong to send me to the gas chamber.

420
00:43:09,746 --> 00:43:12,122
So, maybe I over-reacted a little bit.

421
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,912
You... wanna see my new place?

422
00:43:19,702 --> 00:43:20,410
On your back.

423
00:43:20,702 --> 00:43:24,493
I thought we were going to be more than sex
partners. I thought we were going to be friends.

424
00:43:24,825 --> 00:43:25,618
And this entails?

425
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:31,201
Talking, sharing, clueing me in to whatever
it is that makes you run so hot and cold.

426
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:46,072
- Can I trust you?
- You know you can trust me.

427
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:54,694
OK. Here it goes. Someone steals a million bucks
but, there's a dilemma - she spends it.

428
00:43:55,195 --> 00:43:57,278
Ah, you see this is exactly what I'm talking about.

429
00:43:57,652 --> 00:44:01,485
You're scared to talk about real things.
You're scared to reveal yourself.

430
00:44:02,484 --> 00:44:06,358
Tell me something I wanna know.
Tell me what brought you to Beston.

431
00:44:06,775 --> 00:44:11,358
I don't know Mike. What brought me to Beston?
You're so god-damned intuitive, you tell me.

432
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,647
I tell you what Wendy.
Why don't we talk about me, huh?

433
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:18,564
Good.

434
00:44:19,148 --> 00:44:23,646
I'm er, I'm a claims adjuster.
I talk to all different types of people in my job.

435
00:44:24,022 --> 00:44:25,853
Some are happy to be hearing from me,

436
00:44:26,145 --> 00:44:27,520
some are scared to death.

437
00:44:28,437 --> 00:44:33,728
A car's been stolen, a child's operation's been botched.
They tell me things that they don't tell anyone else.

438
00:44:34,936 --> 00:44:36,310
It's very intimate.

439
00:44:36,644 --> 00:44:37,434
It's boring.

440
00:44:38,434 --> 00:44:40,433
No Wendy, it's intimate.

441
00:44:42,934 --> 00:44:45,933
I talked to a woman the other day whose
husband just died in a car accident.

442
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:48,516
It was just a fifty grand payout,

443
00:44:48,808 --> 00:44:52,306
but she said if she knew it was that much
she'd have killed the guy herself years ago.

444
00:44:52,598 --> 00:44:55,306
Said it was the best thing that
ever happened to her.

445
00:44:56,597 --> 00:44:59,389
You see what I'm saying?
I talk to this lady for 20 minutes,

446
00:45:00,305 --> 00:45:02,888
and I know more about her than I know about you.

447
00:45:07,303 --> 00:45:08,678
Her husband sounds like a real gem.

448
00:45:09,094 --> 00:45:12,177
Actually he was a son of a bitch.
I could tell from his credit report.

449
00:45:13,385 --> 00:45:14,469
You can't tell that from a credit report.

450
00:45:14,884 --> 00:45:17,176
Sure you can.
You can tell lots of things from a credit report.

451
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,968
Yeah? Like what?

452
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:24,758
He had three credit cards, authorised to three
different women, none of which were his wife.

453
00:45:28,339 --> 00:45:29,048
What else?

454
00:45:30,257 --> 00:45:34,256
They lived in the suburbs but there was an apartment,
in his name only, in the city.

455
00:45:40,837 --> 00:45:43,836
- She wanted him dead.
- She was happy when he ended up that way.

456
00:45:44,628 --> 00:45:46,545
Uh-huh. He was cheating on her and you could tell
from the credit report.

457
00:45:46,921 --> 00:45:48,253
Pretty much so.

458
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,419
We can make a list.

459
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:54,125
A list?

460
00:46:08,623 --> 00:46:13,788
It's like when I got here - they were gonna
use the phone book to prospect some customers.
It was a total waste of time.

461
00:46:14,287 --> 00:46:15,203
Why's that?

462
00:46:15,703 --> 00:46:20,912
The phone book's random.
You gotta make a list tailored to the
people who are more likely to buy your product.

463
00:46:21,412 --> 00:46:23,910
Mm-hmm. And what type of list are we trying to make?

464
00:46:24,201 --> 00:46:25,785
A cheating husband list.

465
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,075
What do you wanna pitch to cheating husbands?

466
00:46:29,285 --> 00:46:31,368
Nothing. I wanna pitch to their wives.

467
00:46:31,701 --> 00:46:32,576
Why?

468
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:34,866
Murder.

469
00:46:35,367 --> 00:46:38,284
Murder? Oh, that's very nice...

470
00:46:39,489 --> 00:46:41,865
Your customer said she wanted her husband dead, right?

471
00:46:42,365 --> 00:46:43,656
So, there must be others.

472
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,156
- And you're just gonna sell it to 'em?
- I'm going to try.

473
00:46:48,281 --> 00:46:51,447
There. Men carrying credit unavailable
to their spouses

474
00:46:51,737 --> 00:46:54,570
but available to women 
other than their daughters.

475
00:46:55,361 --> 00:46:58,570
Owning a home, and renting an apartment

476
00:46:58,862 --> 00:46:59,860
in the same Metropolitan area.

477
00:47:00,152 --> 00:47:02,737
- It's a big list.
- It sure is.

478
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:08,317
Cross-reference it with inter-state policy owners
of quarter-of-a-million or more.

479
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:12,733
- Why?
- Profit incentive.

480
00:47:15,523 --> 00:47:16,940
How much? Quarter of a million?

481
00:47:19,608 --> 00:47:20,232
Done.

482
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,731
244 names.

483
00:47:24,023 --> 00:47:24,814
Dial the first one.

484
00:47:25,022 --> 00:47:26,815
- Excuse me?
- Dial it.

485
00:47:28,813 --> 00:47:30,312
I just wanna see if I can do it.

486
00:47:35,188 --> 00:47:37,187
He's home. Next.

487
00:47:42,476 --> 00:47:44,684
Hello, may I speak to a Mr Vincent?

488
00:47:44,976 --> 00:47:47,475
Shit. I think I woke her up.

489
00:47:48,476 --> 00:47:50,891
Oh, it's late.
Cross me for Pacific time.

490
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:57,472
I'll do it.

491
00:48:04,471 --> 00:48:07,179
Yes, may I speak to a Mr Samuel Renford please?

492
00:48:07,845 --> 00:48:09,179
Oh he's not?

493
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:14,177
Oh, I assume I'm speaking with Miss Sally Lindo,

494
00:48:14,844 --> 00:48:16,136
authorised user of his First Bank

495
00:48:16,552 --> 00:48:17,634
credit card?

496
00:48:21,844 --> 00:48:23,634
Oh, I'm sorry Mrs Renford.

497
00:48:27,342 --> 00:48:28,340
Please stop crying ma'am.

498
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:30,756
I'm sure there's a good explanation.

499
00:48:32,215 --> 00:48:34,341
Oh, I see. He's done it before?

500
00:48:35,714 --> 00:48:39,131
Well, you know,
you shouldn't let him get away with this.

501
00:48:42,005 --> 00:48:46,421
Well, I know what a friend of mine did.
Yeah, she had her husband killed.

502
00:48:46,921 --> 00:48:47,421


503
00:48:50,796 --> 00:48:54,502
Yes, there are people who actually
specialise in such cases.

504
00:48:56,419 --> 00:48:59,292
Of course there are risks involved
but there are benefits.

505
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:02,418
Well, does he carry life insurance?

506
00:49:07,208 --> 00:49:11,875
Yes, I could put you in touch with the right people
but I would have to know you were serious about this.

507
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:13,872
A definitie commitment.

508
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:21,162
Mrs Renford you do know I'm kidding, don't you?.

509
00:49:23,371 --> 00:49:25,953
You channel that anger and give him
a nice kick in the balls when he gets home.

510
00:49:27,954 --> 00:49:28,787
Good night.

511
00:49:29,659 --> 00:49:31,952
It's do-able. Your turn.

512
00:49:32,743 --> 00:49:35,450
No thankyou! This is your game.

513
00:49:36,743 --> 00:49:39,534
Our game. You said you wanted 
to be more than just sex partners.

514
00:49:40,659 --> 00:49:41,533
I do.

515
00:49:43,741 --> 00:49:46,948
Commonality Mike. We don't 
like to have the same kind of fun.

516
00:49:47,323 --> 00:49:48,241
This is fun?

517
00:49:48,657 --> 00:49:51,323
Yeah, it's bending the rules,
playing with people's brains.

518
00:49:56,822 --> 00:49:58,030
Yeah, well whatever er...

519
00:49:58,322 --> 00:50:00,238
We can go to my place afterwards.

520
00:50:00,444 --> 00:50:01,320
Your place?

521
00:50:02,528 --> 00:50:05,902
- I thought it was your place, your space?
- I have more space now.

522
00:50:09,027 --> 00:50:10,111
You're sick.

523
00:50:15,899 --> 00:50:17,191
You're really sick.

524
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:48,713
Tell me about your wife.

525
00:51:50,004 --> 00:51:51,003
How'd you know?

526
00:51:51,879 --> 00:51:52,669
I didn't.

527
00:51:55,585 --> 00:51:57,086
That's a good trick.

528
00:51:59,793 --> 00:52:00,585
Tell me.

529
00:52:02,294 --> 00:52:05,291
Not much to tell.
It happened when I lived in Buffalo.

530
00:52:06,793 --> 00:52:08,749
One of those sudden horny things?

531
00:52:09,083 --> 00:52:10,665
You could say that.

532
00:52:11,249 --> 00:52:12,249
Her idea?

533
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:14,665
Between fucking?

534
00:52:18,166 --> 00:52:19,374
What's her name?

535
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:23,247
Trish.

536
00:52:25,454 --> 00:52:26,829
Short for...

537
00:52:27,329 --> 00:52:28,538
Whatever.

538
00:52:30,454 --> 00:52:31,454
Is she pretty?

539
00:52:38,617 --> 00:52:40,327
Are you still in love with her?

540
00:52:48,533 --> 00:52:51,114
I thought you were the 
one that wanted to talk.

541
00:52:52,407 --> 00:52:54,698
You want me to tell you about Trish?

542
00:52:57,822 --> 00:52:59,697
Trish was a mistake.

543
00:53:01,196 --> 00:53:05,113
Boy from Beston moves to Buffalo.
Gets lonely.

544
00:53:05,488 --> 00:53:08,194
Meets girl. Screws up bigtime.

545
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:11,775
Nothin' to be ashamed of.

546
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:19,068
I just wanted some more excitement, you know?
I wanted more adventure.

547
00:53:19,693 --> 00:53:23,774
Until recently, all I wanted to do was get
the hell outta this small town.

548
00:53:25,774 --> 00:53:26,982
Until recently?

549
00:53:27,191 --> 00:53:28,774
That's what I said.

550
00:53:34,481 --> 00:53:35,356
Until recently.

551
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,062
What happened recently?

552
00:53:43,646 --> 00:53:45,144
What happened recently?

553
00:53:49,645 --> 00:53:50,227
What happened, Mike?

554
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:52,435
Can I have a little privacy please?

555
00:53:53,851 --> 00:53:55,351
Tell me what happened.

556
00:53:56,641 --> 00:53:58,516
You happened, alright?

557
00:53:59,725 --> 00:54:01,225
What's so special about me?

558
00:54:01,933 --> 00:54:05,516
You've been out there.
You came here and you chose me.

559
00:54:05,931 --> 00:54:06,642
So?

560
00:54:06,932 --> 00:54:09,722
So I was right.
I'm bigger than this town.

561
00:54:12,138 --> 00:54:13,929
So what's wrong?

562
00:54:14,304 --> 00:54:18,596
You can't stop reminding me
that you're bigger than me.

563
00:54:43,465 --> 00:54:44,673
Good Morning, Alison.

564
00:54:45,463 --> 00:54:47,964
There was a black man here to see you.

565
00:54:48,256 --> 00:54:48,881
What did he want?

566
00:54:49,173 --> 00:54:52,173
He wouldn't say.
He was black though.

567
00:54:57,545 --> 00:54:59,461
Did you tell her about the black man?

568
00:55:07,251 --> 00:55:08,043
Frank Griffith please.

569
00:55:08,334 --> 00:55:10,749
He's not in.
Can I take a message?

570
00:55:11,333 --> 00:55:12,250
No message.

571
00:55:23,623 --> 00:55:25,332
What do you mean you're
 on the run from someone?

572
00:55:25,624 --> 00:55:27,538
Did you lock the door?

573
00:55:27,829 --> 00:55:30,123
- Go check it again.
- It's locked.

574
00:55:30,413 --> 00:55:31,829
What about the top lock?

575
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:34,121
- Wendy, it's all locked!
- Just check it Mike.

576
00:55:34,411 --> 00:55:37,828
Wendy, it's all locked, OK ?
Locked!

577
00:55:38,412 --> 00:55:41,910
Why in the world would
 someone be after you?

578
00:55:47,408 --> 00:55:48,200
Do you love me Mike?

579
00:55:50,117 --> 00:55:50,617
What?

580
00:55:52,992 --> 00:55:55,575
- I made another sale today.
- A sale?

581
00:55:56,575 --> 00:55:58,406
You know, like that night we worked late in your office?

582
00:56:00,572 --> 00:56:05,696
Wendy, if you wanna sell murder to people,
if that's how you have your fun, that's fine by me.

583
00:56:06,781 --> 00:56:08,072
It's nothing that I'm interested in.

584
00:56:08,363 --> 00:56:10,654
Yeah but I can't deliver it without you.

585
00:56:11,363 --> 00:56:13,277
We may have a sale Mike but we didn't deliver.

586
00:56:13,652 --> 00:56:15,069
Deliver murder?

587
00:56:16,361 --> 00:56:17,443
I'm gonna do it.

588
00:56:20,152 --> 00:56:25,151
Lance Collier. Financial consultant,
 retired, lives outside Miami.

589
00:56:25,567 --> 00:56:27,651
Charms young waitresses with
luxury apartments and credit cards

590
00:56:27,941 --> 00:56:30,649
while his wife Mary Beth sits
at home playing Solitaire.

591
00:56:32,567 --> 00:56:36,939
He's faithful to Mary Beth in one way:
she's the only woman he beats.

592
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:39,355
She doesn't need the money

593
00:56:39,647 --> 00:56:42,731
but she would like to see him die
with a considerable amount of pain.

594
00:56:43,312 --> 00:56:44,146
You're crazy.

595
00:56:45,438 --> 00:56:47,645
I did a little creative key-punching

596
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:51,103
and cross-referenced our list parameters
with policy holders at Third Mutual.

597
00:56:51,727 --> 00:56:54,103
You accessed another company's database?

598
00:56:54,727 --> 00:56:56,102
And the good news is:

599
00:56:56,602 --> 00:56:59,600
Our victim does no business with Interstate.

600
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,392
He has no connection to us Mike.

601
00:57:04,516 --> 00:57:06,892
Wendy, you need help.

602
00:57:13,807 --> 00:57:17,180
Look, I'm gonna go out for a while.
You wanna spend the night here, that's fine.

603
00:57:17,889 --> 00:57:19,972
- Talk to me.
- You're deranged.

604
00:57:20,472 --> 00:57:23,096
Mike, the guy deserves it.
Think about his poor wife!

605
00:57:24,886 --> 00:57:27,178
Do you know why I left New York?

606
00:57:28,094 --> 00:57:29,386
To mess with my mind.

607
00:57:30,386 --> 00:57:31,886
Fifteen thousand dollars a year is nothing.

608
00:57:32,177 --> 00:57:34,677
An apartment you're not afraid to walk out of
rents for half that much

609
00:57:34,969 --> 00:57:37,383
and you have to read the god-damned
obituaries to find it.

610
00:57:37,967 --> 00:57:40,675
I'm going back, but I 
won't live like an animal.

611
00:57:42,758 --> 00:57:43,675
I want you to go back with me.

612
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:47,548
Really, you do? And all I have to do is kill someone
while you go apartment hunting?

613
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:49,549
We can do it together.

614
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:53,464
Wendy, maybe it's my quaint small-town morals
but I don't do murder.

615
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:55,340
Yeah, well you would if you loved me.

616
00:57:55,755 --> 00:57:56,839
Get some sleep.

617
00:58:02,836 --> 00:58:04,128
Where are you going?

618
00:58:04,628 --> 00:58:06,418
I'm going to play hockey.

619
00:58:06,919 --> 00:58:09,211
Hockey...
I'll come with you.

620
00:58:10,543 --> 00:58:12,418
You're gonna leave me here by myself?

621
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:15,334
Mike, wait.

622
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:31,290
I'm scared.

623
00:59:00,158 --> 00:59:01,450
Let's go for a little drive.

624
00:59:07,946 --> 00:59:09,071
So how is Clay?

625
00:59:09,363 --> 00:59:11,572
Pissed. We want our money.

626
00:59:11,865 --> 00:59:14,237
- What? Are you two an item?
- Funny woman.

627
00:59:14,654 --> 00:59:15,862
You're on a contingency?

628
00:59:16,362 --> 00:59:18,528
Fifty percent of funds recovered.

629
00:59:18,861 --> 00:59:22,028
- So why even give Clay his half?
- Professionalism.

630
00:59:22,944 --> 00:59:24,817
Wouldn't it be more pleasant to share it with me?

631
00:59:25,942 --> 00:59:29,525
Lady, you had your fun.
Whatever you spent, you spent.

632
00:59:29,942 --> 00:59:33,025
As long as it's within reason.
But it's over.

633
00:59:33,526 --> 00:59:36,107
- You'd get rough?
- I will if I have to.

634
00:59:38,607 --> 00:59:39,899
I can't get it for you tonight.

635
00:59:40,231 --> 00:59:41,731
- Where is it?
- In a bank.

636
00:59:41,898 --> 00:59:44,313
- Show me a statement?
- I don't have a statement.

637
00:59:45,313 --> 00:59:46,897
But they have this 800 line,

638
00:59:47,315 --> 00:59:49,811
you can punch in the account number,
get a balance - it's a real kick.

639
00:59:50,395 --> 00:59:53,603
I imagine. Pull over at the next phone.

640
01:00:11,974 --> 01:00:15,056
I assume that was to get me out of the car,
hoping I'd leave these?

641
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:16,474
'twas.

642
01:00:17,182 --> 01:00:19,265
- So the money's at your place?
- 'tis.

643
01:00:20,764 --> 01:00:21,763
How much is left?

644
01:00:21,971 --> 01:00:23,764
All but a couple of thou'.

645
01:00:24,055 --> 01:00:27,136
Frugal woman.
Let's go.

646
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:41,759
Well, what if I hadn't saved it all?
I mean, come on, you can give me a break.

647
01:00:42,135 --> 01:00:42,759
How much?

648
01:00:43,051 --> 01:00:45,427
Hundred grand. I could easily have spent that much.

649
01:00:54,923 --> 01:00:56,007


650
01:00:56,422 --> 01:00:58,339
How the fuck do you stay up here?

651
01:00:59,006 --> 01:01:01,422
I mean these people...
I go in the store this morning for cigarettes,

652
01:01:01,712 --> 01:01:03,630
they got ducks under the counter.

653
01:01:03,921 --> 01:01:05,796
What? Do they plant these people or do they just grow outta the ground?

654
01:01:07,794 --> 01:01:10,920
And they look at me like...
hell, I don't know.

655
01:01:11,795 --> 01:01:16,711
Well, you know; they're not used to seeing guys like you around here
if you... know what I mean.

656
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:22,002
Is it true what they say?

657
01:01:22,707 --> 01:01:23,292
What?

658
01:01:24,209 --> 01:01:25,666
You know... size.

659
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:28,498
Is it true what they say about white women?

660
01:01:29,082 --> 01:01:31,165
- What's that?
- No ass?

661
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:36,290
Oh, come on; I was wondering for real.
Let me see it.

662
01:01:36,956 --> 01:01:38,662
Fuck you. Drive!

663
01:01:39,954 --> 01:01:40,953
I'm sorry.

664
01:01:41,871 --> 01:01:42,579
About what?

665
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:44,245
About your shortcoming.

666
01:01:44,579 --> 01:01:45,745
I'm not gonna play this game.

667
01:01:45,953 --> 01:01:47,453
Is that why you carry a big gun?

668
01:01:47,872 --> 01:01:50,078
The Freudian mind-fuck isn't gonna work either.

669
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:55,367
Touchy.
I'm sure your woman is very understanding.

670
01:01:55,866 --> 01:01:58,741
Exactly how is it that we end this phase of our relationship?

671
01:01:59,158 --> 01:02:03,033
By you showing it to me.
Come on, let me see it. I've never seen one before.

672
01:02:04,949 --> 01:02:06,657
I'll show you my ass.

673
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:10,114
What makes you think I wanna see your bony ass?

674
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:13,115
- Show me.
- Show me!

675
01:02:13,531 --> 01:02:15,113
I'm driving. You go first.

676
01:02:15,403 --> 01:02:16,905
Nah, you go first.

677
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:21,321
You'll shut the fuck up if I show you?

678
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:23,695
I'm sure I'll be too stunned to speak.

679
01:02:24,111 --> 01:02:25,403
I don't believe this.

680
01:02:27,109 --> 01:02:28,026
You're crazy.

681
01:02:29,402 --> 01:02:30,317
Shit.

682
01:02:37,902 --> 01:02:39,815
OK, there, You happy?

683
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:40,982
What the hell are you doin'?

684
01:02:59,270 --> 01:03:01,978
I'll make sure the press says nothing about your husband.

685
01:03:04,685 --> 01:03:06,350
I really appreciate it.

686
01:03:09,144 --> 01:03:10,766
There's only one more question I need to ask.

687
01:03:11,642 --> 01:03:13,058
I don't mean to pry...

688
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,140
the man with you

689
01:03:17,848 --> 01:03:21,264
appeared to be not entirely in his pants
at the time of impact.

690
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:23,558
Can you tell me what happened
just before you went off the road?

691
01:03:24,933 --> 01:03:28,056
Well, like I told you before he tried to
get me to contact my husband and...

692
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:31,138
I refused of course.

693
01:03:32,429 --> 01:03:35,221
Well he became... you know,

694
01:03:36,929 --> 01:03:38,928
Motherfucker this, motherfucker that...

695
01:03:39,803 --> 01:03:40,927
Like in the movies?

696
01:03:41,635 --> 01:03:42,800
Exactly.

697
01:03:45,635 --> 01:03:49,510
Next thing I knew...
I only remember bits and pieces of it but he...

698
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:52,215
the jist of it was that he was going to...

699
01:03:53,716 --> 01:03:55,091
impale me with his

700
01:03:57,715 --> 01:03:58,215
big...

701
01:03:59,506 --> 01:04:00,381
There's another man

702
01:04:00,714 --> 01:04:01,382
waiting to see you when you're through.

703
01:04:06,381 --> 01:04:07,879
I'm through here anyway.

704
01:04:09,297 --> 01:04:10,296
Thankyou ma'am.

705
01:04:15,795 --> 01:04:16,294
You alright?

706
01:04:20,251 --> 01:04:20,877
How was hockey?

707
01:04:23,085 --> 01:04:25,584
I'm very sorry I walked away.

708
01:04:28,748 --> 01:04:31,041
Wendy, you were just, you were scaring the hell outta me. I mean

709
01:04:31,458 --> 01:04:34,541
The things you were saying -
you weren't serious?

710
01:04:34,956 --> 01:04:36,373
What do you think?

711
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,456
I don't understand you.

712
01:04:39,831 --> 01:04:42,163
Yeah? Where's the effort to try?

713
01:04:44,579 --> 01:04:47,454
I'm very sorry I walked away.

714
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:51,620
Mike, what I suggested I suggested for us.

715
01:04:51,828 --> 01:04:54,826
The only loser in the whole deal is a rich, cheating, wife-beating

716
01:04:55,245 --> 01:04:56,827
old bastard.

717
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:58,619
You're talking about murder.

718
01:04:59,118 --> 01:05:03,200
Yeah? So?
Oh, I'm sorry - it's one of the commandments, right?

719
01:05:04,825 --> 01:05:05,824
Think about what you're saying.

720
01:05:08,617 --> 01:05:11,406
Is it the morality of murder that bothers you or the personal risk?

721
01:05:12,907 --> 01:05:13,908
Murder is wrong.

722
01:05:14,407 --> 01:05:16,114
Yeah, unless the president says to do it.

723
01:05:17,904 --> 01:05:19,988
Let me ask you this: if you found out Lance Collier was dead

724
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,488
would you spend your life bringing
his killer to justice?

725
01:05:23,987 --> 01:05:24,987
Would you go to his funeral?

726
01:05:25,196 --> 01:05:26,903
- Probably not.
- Would you feel sorry for him?

727
01:05:27,279 --> 01:05:28,905
No, and this is not the point.

728
01:05:32,192 --> 01:05:34,986
I really like you Mike.
But I can't live here forever.

729
01:05:36,359 --> 01:05:36,985
What does that mean?

730
01:05:41,858 --> 01:05:42,774
Where're you going?

731
01:05:43,275 --> 01:05:44,858
Gotta bring home the bacon.

732
01:05:45,773 --> 01:05:49,065
Are you checked out?
Did the doctors give you permission to leave?

733
01:05:50,773 --> 01:05:52,564
Always looking for the rules, Mike.

734
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,725
You want me to er, come in with you?

735
01:06:18,015 --> 01:06:18,808
Are you sure?

736
01:06:20,933 --> 01:06:23,307
- Wendy, are you alright?
- I'm fine.

737
01:06:24,016 --> 01:06:29,224
OK, I tell you what. I'm gonna go home.
If there's anything you need at all you just gimme a call, alright?

738
01:06:46,913 --> 01:06:49,593
Guess who.  Clay...

739
01:06:50,035 --> 01:06:50,817
Hello...

740
01:06:51,886 --> 01:06:53,968
Christ, you're dangerous.

741
01:06:54,382 --> 01:06:57,800
The cops called to confirm that
he was working for me.

742
01:06:58,090 --> 01:07:01,758
You do know that if you finger me for the deal then
I'm taking you down too?

743
01:07:04,173 --> 01:07:05,090
I know.

744
01:07:05,881 --> 01:07:07,255
Look out your window.

745
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:12,046
That's Harlan's replacement.
A local. Name's Bert.

746
01:07:12,755 --> 01:07:15,254
He won't hurt you.
I need a New Yorker for that.

747
01:07:16,839 --> 01:07:19,418
He's just there to make sure that
I don't lose track of you again.

748
01:07:20,169 --> 01:07:21,544
He's very professional.

749
01:07:21,752 --> 01:07:22,960
Can we get past this?

750
01:07:23,336 --> 01:07:26,461
There is a nice, warm divorce
waiting for you here.

751
01:07:27,959 --> 01:07:29,043
I want half the money.

752
01:07:29,251 --> 01:07:31,751
- Not a chance, Bitch-et.
- Don't call me that!

753
01:07:32,917 --> 01:07:34,833
I'll call you whatever I want.

754
01:07:35,123 --> 01:07:39,832
I borrowed a hundred K from a man
whose first and last names end in vowels.

755
01:07:40,206 --> 01:07:44,206
Every week I owe him a new ten thousand
dollars in interest

756
01:07:44,622 --> 01:07:46,206
and when I come up just a little short,

757
01:07:46,705 --> 01:07:49,913
he's got this very fun game
that he plays with thumbs.

758
01:07:50,329 --> 01:07:53,996
I hired a private detective for 50%,

759
01:07:54,414 --> 01:07:58,120
but now that I know where you are
I am perfectly willing to spend all of the money

760
01:07:58,495 --> 01:08:01,910
in hiring a clinical sociopath
to take it from you,

761
01:08:02,202 --> 01:08:04,994
and fuck you through the eye sockets
JUST FOR FUN!

762
01:08:08,491 --> 01:08:09,575
OK, look - I'll buy a week.

763
01:08:10,908 --> 01:08:14,200
I'll buy a week.
I'll send you ten thousand dollars.

764
01:08:14,574 --> 01:08:19,075
No, make it fifteen so you can get back to your life
while I wrap things up here.

765
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:22,363
That sounds interesting.

766
01:08:23,989 --> 01:08:27,655
Then I come back,
I'll give you the cash.

767
01:08:29,571 --> 01:08:32,071
Maybe you'll be feeling
a little more generous then?

768
01:08:32,445 --> 01:08:34,361
I keep Bert on your ass.

769
01:08:34,778 --> 01:08:36,859
Of course you do.
I've given you no reason to trust me.

770
01:08:37,361 --> 01:08:42,151
Only a week.
And I'm still interviewing sociopaths.

771
01:08:45,150 --> 01:08:47,650
Oh Bridge! What made you do this?

772
01:08:48,025 --> 01:08:49,358
I don't know. You slapped me.

773
01:08:50,525 --> 01:08:52,440
That's just an excuse.

774
01:08:52,649 --> 01:08:55,732
Probably right but I get to slap you back.

775
01:08:57,230 --> 01:08:58,313
Hey, it's a deal.

776
01:09:02,813 --> 01:09:03,605
Slap you back hard.

777
01:09:12,518 --> 01:09:14,895
- Yes, I'm still here.
- You must have your name on the ticket.

778
01:09:15,227 --> 01:09:19,309
What do you mean my name has to be on it?
I'm going to Miami for Christ's sake, not Iraq!

779
01:09:19,685 --> 01:09:21,101
Well it's a regulation.

780
01:09:21,185 --> 01:09:24,099
- Oh yeah? What's the pilot's name?
- Erm, Well I can't tell you that.

781
01:09:25,308 --> 01:09:27,890
Oh, I see. You have to know my name
but I can't know who's driving?

782
01:09:28,182 --> 01:09:30,100
Well, let me ask someone.
May I put you on hold?

783
01:09:30,391 --> 01:09:31,682
Yes, I'll hold.

784
01:09:33,972 --> 01:09:34,599
Am I interrupting?

785
01:09:38,887 --> 01:09:40,388
Don't ever come in here without knocking.

786
01:09:41,179 --> 01:09:44,095
I'm sorry... I knew you were on the phone.
I just didn't wanna...

787
01:09:44,387 --> 01:09:45,969
How long have you been standing there?

788
01:09:47,054 --> 01:09:48,179
Just got here.

789
01:09:49,761 --> 01:09:50,386
You going away?

790
01:09:51,553 --> 01:09:52,053
Yes.

791
01:09:55,052 --> 01:09:55,552
New York ?

792
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:56,842
Yes.

793
01:10:00,466 --> 01:10:01,342
For good?

794
01:10:05,341 --> 01:10:06,758
No. Just for the weekend.

795
01:10:08,758 --> 01:10:09,755
With everything that's happened,

796
01:10:09,755 --> 01:10:12,631
I er, I just... I need to get away for a little bit.

797
01:10:41,623 --> 01:10:45,706
I thought you might be hungry sitting
out here all day so I baked you some cookies.

798
01:10:49,206 --> 01:10:50,997
I'll leave this one to your discretion.

799
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:46,234
Take me to Buffalo.

800
01:12:25,976 --> 01:12:29,766
The husband's name is Mike Swale.
I believe they were married about six months ago.

801
01:12:30,475 --> 01:12:31,765
I appreciate this.

802
01:12:47,138 --> 01:12:48,262
Hope that does it.

803
01:13:06,926 --> 01:13:07,842
Trish?

804
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:12,132
Hi, I'm Jean Wilbur with the county health department.
We spoke on the phone about your survey.

805
01:13:12,423 --> 01:13:13,216
Come on in.

806
01:13:42,792 --> 01:13:43,667
Let's go.

807
01:14:45,904 --> 01:14:47,820
- A beer?
- Yeah, that'd be great. Please.

808
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:50,318
- How's things?
- Life is good.

809
01:14:50,609 --> 01:14:51,484
Go up to him and tell him...

810
01:14:51,693 --> 01:14:52,776
Someone's gotta tell him.

811
01:14:53,483 --> 01:14:56,109
Yeah. I'm serious. Go and tell him.

812
01:14:57,608 --> 01:14:59,108
- Do it.
- Alright, man.

813
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:06,774
Hey Mike, how you doin'?

814
01:15:07,190 --> 01:15:08,897
Hey Chris, alright man, how are you?

815
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:11,188
Let me get him a drink.
Whatever he wants.

816
01:15:11,355 --> 01:15:13,770
- Yeah, can I get a shot, man?
- You bet Chris.

817
01:15:14,269 --> 01:15:15,354
So, you still seein' that lady?

818
01:15:19,061 --> 01:15:24,269
Did I ever tell you once I met her outside of here last week.
She said she wanted to ask me somethin'.

819
01:15:27,352 --> 01:15:28,269
The point?

820
01:15:28,934 --> 01:15:31,267
She said she wanted to know your secret.

821
01:15:31,768 --> 01:15:34,433
"What's the last thing Mike'll want me to know?"

822
01:15:36,558 --> 01:15:37,223
What'd you tell her?

823
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,931
I didn't tell her anything man.
I mean, you're my friend.

824
01:15:41,848 --> 01:15:46,931
I mean, besides, what do I know about Buffalo?
I mean you only told Shep about the wife and everything.

825
01:15:48,848 --> 01:15:49,514
Is that it?

826
01:15:57,011 --> 01:16:01,802
She went for me fly and she said
she wanted to suck it outta me.

827
01:16:07,884 --> 01:16:09,218
Tell me why you're lying Chris!

828
01:16:11,799 --> 01:16:12,591
I'm not!

829
01:16:13,883 --> 01:16:16,298
Alright man, I fucking came on to her
and she shot me down.

830
01:16:16,590 --> 01:16:17,799
Get off him, Mike!

831
01:16:19,174 --> 01:16:20,799
Get off, man!

832
01:16:24,089 --> 01:16:25,171
Clean your face.

833
01:16:56,539 --> 01:16:59,040
Don't be afraid: it's only a machine.

834
01:17:00,457 --> 01:17:03,331
Hey, it's me - designated fuck boy.

835
01:17:03,955 --> 01:17:08,036
I know you're outta town but
I just wanted to hear your voice.

836
01:17:09,911 --> 01:17:15,034
I love you! I admit it. I'm sure you
feel the same way - I'm sure you love you too.

837
01:17:16,828 --> 01:17:22,035
You know Wendy, when you first came to town
I really thought you were the one. I... really did.

838
01:17:23,491 --> 01:17:27,324
You were on the move.
It meant you couldn't stay here.

839
01:17:33,490 --> 01:17:36,491
I just didn't trust myself after what
happened in Buffalo see.

840
01:17:36,782 --> 01:17:40,404
I just didn't trust myself to be out
on my own, you know and

841
01:17:41,279 --> 01:17:43,570
I seem to lose my judgement outside
of Beston.

842
01:17:45,071 --> 01:17:46,280
Apparently so.

843
01:17:46,904 --> 01:17:49,778
Well, now it seems to be leavin' me here, you know. I...

844
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:52,694
try, I really try to believe that you love me

845
01:17:52,986 --> 01:17:56,067
but you keep treatin' me like
some kind of forage experiment.

846
01:17:57,776 --> 01:18:00,358
You talk about us livin' in New York.

847
01:18:01,651 --> 01:18:04,274
I mean really, come on, how long until phhht!

848
01:18:05,942 --> 01:18:10,648
Where'd she go?
Where'd she go?

849
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:15,855
If I only knew you loved me Wendy...

850
01:18:22,854 --> 01:18:25,353
I can't let you hear this!
I can't let you hear this!

851
01:21:04,861 --> 01:21:05,733
What is this?

852
01:21:07,315 --> 01:21:09,025
Wendy, you didn't go to New York.

853
01:21:10,025 --> 01:21:11,441
Why'd you go to Miami?

854
01:21:14,733 --> 01:21:15,523
Why?

855
01:21:18,022 --> 01:21:21,439
Did you find this er,
did you find this Lance Collier?

856
01:21:23,605 --> 01:21:27,312
Wendy did you m- did you murder Lance Collier ?
Tell me I'm wrong. Did you?

857
01:21:31,602 --> 01:21:33,019
Are you gonna turn me in Mike?

858
01:21:33,311 --> 01:21:36,102
Well if I don't, it makes me an accomplice!

859
01:21:37,018 --> 01:21:38,685
Christ, you are good at rules.

860
01:21:39,519 --> 01:21:41,393
Wendy, you don't even seem bothered
by what you've done!

861
01:21:42,684 --> 01:21:44,184
I did it for us Mike.

862
01:21:44,476 --> 01:21:46,682
- What bothers me is your attitude.
- My attitude?

863
01:21:48,890 --> 01:21:51,681
I expect unconditional support from
a lover. For better or worse.

864
01:21:53,888 --> 01:21:57,262
Jesus! I killed the bastard.
I wouldn't take it back if I could.

865
01:21:58,680 --> 01:21:59,389
You can't!

866
01:21:59,764 --> 01:22:00,554
He deserved it.

867
01:22:00,764 --> 01:22:02,471
- Wendy, nobody deserves to...
- Please!

868
01:22:02,887 --> 01:22:06,053
Spare me your brainless countrified morality.

869
01:22:06,344 --> 01:22:08,677
The world's better off without Lance Collier.

870
01:22:09,052 --> 01:22:11,844
Only ten minutes I knew him he proved it
to me twenty times.

871
01:22:14,260 --> 01:22:15,553
Mrs Collier thought so too.

872
01:22:15,761 --> 01:22:17,259
Jesus Christ!

873
01:22:18,049 --> 01:22:19,134
There's your fucking evidence.

874
01:22:20,967 --> 01:22:22,259
And there are my fucking fingerprints!

875
01:22:22,548 --> 01:22:25,633
Hey, maybe you'll get a reward and
you can open up a fucking feed store.

876
01:22:26,548 --> 01:22:28,132
Get the fuck outta here.

877
01:22:36,713 --> 01:22:40,505
You know Wendy, I er, I really
thought you loved me.

878
01:22:41,839 --> 01:22:43,126
I never said that.

879
01:23:10,705 --> 01:23:11,997
You son of a bitch!

880
01:23:12,997 --> 01:23:14,580
Did you sniff my underwear drawer too Mike?

881
01:23:15,579 --> 01:23:18,372
You think you know everything now, don't you?
Well you don't!

882
01:23:18,871 --> 01:23:20,868
We all have our Buffalo girls Mike!

883
01:23:21,161 --> 01:23:21,869
You murdered.

884
01:23:24,285 --> 01:23:26,952
You wanna live bigger but there's
nothin' you'd kill for.

885
01:23:28,285 --> 01:23:31,742
There's a place for people like that:
It's called Beston.

886
01:23:33,075 --> 01:23:33,742
Get out.

887
01:23:35,157 --> 01:23:35,657
Get out!

888
01:23:45,530 --> 01:23:47,156
Take your fucking shirt too!

889
01:24:19,690 --> 01:24:20,483
Come in.

890
01:24:25,814 --> 01:24:26,396
Yes?

891
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:28,105
A couple of questions...

892
01:24:31,105 --> 01:24:33,895
This guy in Florida.
He really beat his wife?

893
01:24:35,562 --> 01:24:38,185
Like a punching bag.
Country boy.

894
01:24:39,477 --> 01:24:43,477
Wendy, I'm trying to accept this, OK.
I really want to be able to take you back.

895
01:24:44,350 --> 01:24:46,977
I'm outta here Mike,
I won the lottery. Going to New York.

896
01:24:47,975 --> 01:24:49,183
I could come with you.

897
01:24:50,350 --> 01:24:52,348
You have a way of making a woman feel
like a one-way train ticket.

898
01:24:52,848 --> 01:24:53,766
It's not like that.

899
01:24:54,057 --> 01:24:55,058
Get out on your own, Mike.

900
01:24:55,266 --> 01:24:56,639
- What do you want?
- Nothing you're offering.

901
01:24:57,056 --> 01:24:57,847
Try me!

902
01:25:05,556 --> 01:25:07,055
A relationship of equals.

903
01:25:09,846 --> 01:25:13,218
That means commitment.
I've done something committed, you haven't.

904
01:25:14,053 --> 01:25:17,718
Oh come on! Murder!
Murder is commitment?

905
01:25:19,135 --> 01:25:20,717
Yeah, when I've done it and you haven't it is.

906
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:30,425
Fine. OK. Who? Who do you want me to erase?

907
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:32,216
Who do you want me to kill?

908
01:25:35,506 --> 01:25:36,006
This Cahill guy

909
01:25:36,215 --> 01:25:37,422
in New York.

910
01:25:39,087 --> 01:25:42,588
He gets a hold of property tax rolls,
finds out who's delinquent a few bucks

911
01:25:43,006 --> 01:25:45,377
He pays the balance. Then waits.

912
01:25:46,794 --> 01:25:51,169
If the sucker doesn't figure out what
happened, Cahill becomes owner of the property.

913
01:25:52,003 --> 01:25:56,377
You know what he did last week?
He kicked an 84-year-old woman out on the street with her walker.

914
01:25:56,793 --> 01:25:58,084
That's his credit report.

915
01:25:59,792 --> 01:26:00,876
Are you serious?

916
01:26:01,875 --> 01:26:05,458
Double indemnity.
Ten million payoff to the widow

917
01:26:05,958 --> 01:26:08,751
if he dies an unnatural death.
She's willing to give us a third.

918
01:26:10,247 --> 01:26:11,455
You called her?

919
01:26:13,748 --> 01:26:15,372
She said she's bought things over the phone before.

920
01:26:18,665 --> 01:26:20,456
You try to make this sound reasonable?

921
01:26:21,246 --> 01:26:22,663
It is reasonable.

922
01:26:25,163 --> 01:26:28,536
You. Me. Three million bucks.

923
01:26:29,328 --> 01:26:31,160
New York City, Mike.

924
01:26:34,326 --> 01:26:35,617
It's reasonable.

925
01:26:36,034 --> 01:26:37,243
Where does this end with you?

926
01:26:37,451 --> 01:26:39,742
Right then. Right with Cahill.
We'd be even.

927
01:26:43,533 --> 01:26:47,323
I've just realised that I don't want to
be with you enought to be like you.

928
01:26:49,698 --> 01:26:50,824
Get off me!

929
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:32,355
Dear Mike, I got a job at Interstate.

930
01:27:32,646 --> 01:27:34,646
I'll be moving to Beston soon.

931
01:28:09,139 --> 01:28:13,513
Dear Mike, I got a job at Interstate
and I'll be moving to Beston soon...

932
01:28:14,095 --> 01:28:19,303
No-one has to know about our little secret.
I just wanna be near you. Love, Trish.

933
01:28:34,674 --> 01:28:38,174
I'll do it. I'll kill the bastard.
There's just one thing.

934
01:28:39,464 --> 01:28:42,965
I am never coming back to Beston.
Not for one second.

935
01:28:47,254 --> 01:28:50,087
We pull up sticks, we settle in
right afterwards.

936
01:28:50,379 --> 01:28:52,378
We put all this behind us, alright?

937
01:28:52,670 --> 01:28:54,755
So what made you change your mind?

938
01:28:55,878 --> 01:29:00,250
We're gonna have a life together Wendy.
In New York, the two of us, alone.

939
01:29:02,834 --> 01:29:04,458
Beston Police Department, Officer Lewis.

940
01:29:04,751 --> 01:29:05,458
Hi, Police?

941
01:29:06,251 --> 01:29:09,334
This is Mrs Neff, 313 Squire Road.

942
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:13,748
There's this strange man outside my house.
He tried to show his erm...

943
01:29:16,248 --> 01:29:17,748
his diddly to my 4-year-old daughter.

944
01:29:18,122 --> 01:29:19,038
Is he still there?

945
01:29:19,248 --> 01:29:21,247
We'll have a squad car there in three minutes.

946
01:30:00,196 --> 01:30:01,072
I'm working!

947
01:30:02,695 --> 01:30:03,778
What are you doin'?

948
01:30:08,277 --> 01:30:11,985
Hey! She's getting away!
It's my job! She's getting away!

949
01:30:20,858 --> 01:30:22,151
Give me your cheat sheet.

950
01:30:22,651 --> 01:30:23,358
Why?

951
01:30:24,067 --> 01:30:26,358
You don't want it on you!
You memorised it, right?

952
01:30:33,854 --> 01:30:34,731
Let's hear it.

953
01:30:37,354 --> 01:30:42,521
When I get to the Port Authority I go straight outside,
find a cab, don't talk to anybody.

954
01:30:43,147 --> 01:30:46,938
I have the cab take me to Broadway
and 125th Street,

955
01:30:47,437 --> 01:30:49,226
I find Cahill's apartment.

956
01:30:50,726 --> 01:30:55,518
I wait until 11 O'clock, when we're
sure the girlfriend's gone.
I wait until the lights go out.

957
01:30:56,017 --> 01:30:58,226
And a half hour more to make sure he's asleep.

958
01:30:58,913 --> 01:31:04,181
I put on the gloves. I check and make sure
I've got the cuffs - four pairs.

959
01:31:05,097 --> 01:31:10,305
I've got the gun, the knife,
the bandana and the flashlight. Keys too:

960
01:31:11,806 --> 01:31:16,389
to the apartment, to the building
and to the doorknob.

961
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:21,095
I walk up the stairs,
I open the apartment door.

962
01:31:21,803 --> 01:31:24,388
I enter, I shut the door,
I lock the door.

963
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:27,092
I find him.

964
01:31:27,384 --> 01:31:31,384
I make sure he sees the gun.
I tell him not to say a word.

965
01:31:31,884 --> 01:31:33,176
You hit him hard if he does.

966
01:31:35,549 --> 01:31:37,382
I close any open curtains.

967
01:31:38,465 --> 01:31:41,965
I turn on the lights,
I tell him I'm just there to rob the place.

968
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:48,131
I find a sturdy chair.
I sit him in it. I toss him the cuffs.

969
01:31:49,049 --> 01:31:53,337
I tell him to cuff himself to the chair.
Left hand, right hand, left leg, right leg.

970
01:31:53,754 --> 01:31:55,630
Make sure I hear the click of the cuffs.

971
01:31:56,836 --> 01:32:00,754
Then I er, tell him to open up his mouth.
I gag him, tight.

972
01:32:01,835 --> 01:32:04,543
I then use the gun to knock him out
with a blow to the head.

973
01:32:06,708 --> 01:32:10,918
And I er, keep stabbing him until he's...

974
01:32:12,334 --> 01:32:13,208
dead.

975
01:32:16,707 --> 01:32:17,707
Keep going.

976
01:32:18,917 --> 01:32:21,207
I take one final look around, turn off the lights.

977
01:32:23,706 --> 01:32:25,788
I unlock the door, I exit, I shut the door, I lock it.

978
01:32:26,622 --> 01:32:28,704
I'll get the gloves.

979
01:32:30,705 --> 01:32:32,288
Why do I have to turn off the lights?

980
01:32:33,288 --> 01:32:34,703
Pop psychology.

981
01:32:35,413 --> 01:32:38,076
Lets yourself know you've
finished an unpleasant chore.

982
01:32:40,577 --> 01:32:42,076
The unpleasant chore...

983
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:47,659
You're up for this, right?

984
01:33:17,653 --> 01:33:18,734
I'm here to rob the place.

985
01:33:20,526 --> 01:33:22,444
I thought you were the new decorator.

986
01:33:22,819 --> 01:33:26,941
Just shut your mouth,
do what I tell you. Get up, get out of bed.
Come on, get up!

987
01:33:27,441 --> 01:33:31,316
Sorry. I don't want to mess with
your concentration...

988
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:35,315
skilled labour and all.

989
01:33:39,312 --> 01:33:39,813
What now?

990
01:33:41,605 --> 01:33:44,229
Go ahead and er, cuff your handcuffs
to your legcuffs there.

991
01:33:45,395 --> 01:33:47,687
- That'll be comfortable!
- I told you to shut up!

992
01:33:55,685 --> 01:33:56,184
Now what?

993
01:33:58,977 --> 01:33:59,685
I'm gonna gag you.

994
01:34:01,392 --> 01:34:05,766
How am I gonna tell you where
everything is? Am I yelling?

995
01:34:06,474 --> 01:34:09,100
You have a gun. I'm cooperating.
Forget the gag.

996
01:34:09,392 --> 01:34:10,473
The gag's important.

997
01:34:10,765 --> 01:34:12,681
Did you read a book on this?

998
01:34:13,681 --> 01:34:16,180
You know, kid, you don't look like a dope-head.

999
01:34:16,555 --> 01:34:17,180
What?

1000
01:34:17,472 --> 01:34:20,971
I just write prescriptions, right?
I got no stash.

1001
01:34:21,471 --> 01:34:23,472
The money goes to a loan shark.

1002
01:34:23,847 --> 01:34:25,678
I got some aspirin in the medicine cabinet.

1003
01:34:25,970 --> 01:34:28,469
But other than that I got nothing here you want.

1004
01:34:28,761 --> 01:34:31,261
I'm not interested in your drugs, alright?

1005
01:34:32,136 --> 01:34:34,052
You're just breaking in at random?

1006
01:34:34,344 --> 01:34:37,260
Great. The guy next door is outta town for a month.

1007
01:34:38,427 --> 01:34:39,259
Open!

1008
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:45,133
My wife has jewellery.

1009
01:35:23,873 --> 01:35:25,375
I can't do it Wendy, I can't do it!

1010
01:35:36,371 --> 01:35:38,787
Hold it right there pal, hold it!

1011
01:35:41,078 --> 01:35:41,661
Right there!

1012
01:35:58,325 --> 01:35:59,157
Talk fast.

1013
01:35:59,532 --> 01:36:00,823
She's my wife.

1014
01:36:01,448 --> 01:36:03,740
Her name's Bridget.
You know her as Wendy Kroy.

1015
01:36:04,323 --> 01:36:07,823
She stole a fortune from me after
making me steal it.

1016
01:36:08,322 --> 01:36:09,738
But she's not willing to give it up.

1017
01:36:09,946 --> 01:36:13,614
But she can't come back to New York
without settling with me first.

1018
01:36:14,528 --> 01:36:16,820
And that's where you come in.
See, she hired you...

1019
01:36:19,028 --> 01:36:21,736
Wait a minute...
Oh, fuck!

1020
01:36:23,026 --> 01:36:24,694
You're into her, huh?

1021
01:36:25,818 --> 01:36:29,026
It's logical: I guess there aren't
many women fuck like her in cow town.

1022
01:36:36,315 --> 01:36:37,816
Keep talking.

1023
01:36:38,899 --> 01:36:40,274
You're a schizoid, talk to yourself.

1024
01:36:40,774 --> 01:36:41,481
You really her husband?

1025
01:36:42,273 --> 01:36:42,980
Who'd she say I was?

1026
01:36:43,398 --> 01:36:44,398
Foreclosure lawyer.

1027
01:36:45,771 --> 01:36:46,605
And you believe that?

1028
01:36:46,896 --> 01:36:48,771
It says so on the mailbox.

1029
01:36:49,188 --> 01:36:49,689
You're crazy.

1030
01:36:50,063 --> 01:36:52,062
It does. It says Cahill on the mailbox.

1031
01:36:52,562 --> 01:36:55,061
Find one other thing in here that...

1032
01:37:01,852 --> 01:37:05,475
She's here. She's in New York.

1033
01:37:08,058 --> 01:37:10,641
She must have switched the label
on the mailbox.

1034
01:37:14,933 --> 01:37:17,640
She must have worked up one hell
of a morality play for you

1035
01:37:17,931 --> 01:37:20,138
but you don't like the way it ends.

1036
01:37:20,430 --> 01:37:21,554
What are you talking about?

1037
01:37:22,722 --> 01:37:25,638
You're supposed to kill Cahill,
only it's me.

1038
01:37:25,931 --> 01:37:28,346
Then she fingers you for the murder.

1039
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:30,512
I don't think so.

1040
01:37:31,718 --> 01:37:33,010
Oh, she wouldn't lie to you?

1041
01:37:34,636 --> 01:37:37,801
Denial. OK, I'm still Cahill.

1042
01:37:38,134 --> 01:37:40,636
Did she ever happen to mention
that she knows Cahill?

1043
01:37:41,510 --> 01:37:45,801
So well that he would have a picture
of her in his appartment.
That's a pretty major omission, isn't it?

1044
01:37:46,217 --> 01:37:49,008
Will you shut up? Shut up and let me think.
Just shut your mouth!

1045
01:37:49,590 --> 01:37:52,298
Take your time.
She probably has the cops heading here right now.

1046
01:37:58,504 --> 01:38:01,880
She has to know that you've
actually offed me first.

1047
01:38:03,295 --> 01:38:04,795
You're signalling her.

1048
01:38:05,795 --> 01:38:06,295
How?

1049
01:38:07,588 --> 01:38:09,002
I'm calling her later.

1050
01:38:09,669 --> 01:38:11,670
She's not in Beston, cow-boy.

1051
01:39:05,115 --> 01:39:06,033
Hi, Bridge.

1052
01:39:07,698 --> 01:39:09,406
So you were gonna have me kill your husband.

1053
01:39:15,821 --> 01:39:16,696
I was.

1054
01:39:17,780 --> 01:39:19,405
And then tip the Police.

1055
01:39:19,779 --> 01:39:21,403
- No I wasn't.
- Bullshit.

1056
01:39:22,696 --> 01:39:25,401
She tells the cops she's reconciling
with me,

1057
01:39:25,903 --> 01:39:27,486
that's the suitcase.

1058
01:39:27,695 --> 01:39:28,777
Shut up, Clay.

1059
01:39:29,070 --> 01:39:30,903
You have a jealous boyfriend.

1060
01:39:31,401 --> 01:39:34,692
It was a great idea Bridge,
but I guess Mikey wasn't up to it.

1061
01:39:35,691 --> 01:39:36,774
What do you say?

1062
01:39:37,483 --> 01:39:38,983
Is it game, set, match?

1063
01:39:46,272 --> 01:39:47,063
Who has the key?

1064
01:39:48,564 --> 01:39:49,148
I do.

1065
01:39:51,354 --> 01:39:52,355
Oh, fuck.

1066
01:39:54,271 --> 01:39:55,645
Funny thing, Bridge.

1067
01:39:56,436 --> 01:39:59,228
I coulda put this money some place
where you wouldn't have gotten it.

1068
01:40:00,437 --> 01:40:02,145
I might have taken you back.

1069
01:40:04,145 --> 01:40:07,724
You're a very funny lady.
You know the role-playing thing?

1070
01:40:09,517 --> 01:40:11,849
Baby you make one hell of a horny nun.

1071
01:40:17,141 --> 01:40:21,515
What do you say Bridge,
do you wanna stay married?

1072
01:40:34,304 --> 01:40:35,387
What are you doing?

1073
01:40:39,510 --> 01:40:40,677
Oh my God!

1074
01:40:50,093 --> 01:40:50,967
Now we have a future.

1075
01:40:51,384 --> 01:40:52,675
You're not human.

1076
01:40:53,881 --> 01:40:55,299
I did it for us, Mike.

1077
01:40:56,798 --> 01:40:59,382
But he was insured.
Fuck me, Mike.

1078
01:40:59,673 --> 01:41:00,381
What?

1079
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:04,088
It's a role-play.
You're the intruder,

1080
01:41:04,881 --> 01:41:06,756
you kill my husband, you rape me.

1081
01:41:07,047 --> 01:41:08,878
You're not gonna kill me.
You're not gonna kill me Bridget.

1082
01:41:09,169 --> 01:41:11,545
You're gonna kill me if I don't
do what you say, right Mike?

1083
01:41:12,670 --> 01:41:14,253
Get offa me.
GET OFFA ME!

1084
01:41:17,253 --> 01:41:18,544
You're lucky I don't kill you...

1085
01:41:19,253 --> 01:41:20,252
You're lucky!

1086
01:41:20,460 --> 01:41:21,335
Rape me, Mike.

1087
01:41:23,252 --> 01:41:24,250
You're goin' to jail.

1088
01:41:26,957 --> 01:41:28,750
Trish wasn't really coming to Beston, Mike.

1089
01:41:34,124 --> 01:41:34,914
What did you say?

1090
01:41:36,540 --> 01:41:40,413
You shouldn't've told me you never slept with a man before.
It must've been some wild night

1091
01:41:40,830 --> 01:41:42,413
you getting married so fast.

1092
01:41:42,705 --> 01:41:43,537
He couldn't really...

1093
01:41:44,912 --> 01:41:46,037
...how to keep the goods hidden
for a whole two days?

1094
01:41:46,204 --> 01:41:49,621
What'd he do - tell you the little bobbly
thing at the back of your throat was a clitoris?

1095
01:41:50,704 --> 01:41:53,495
You married a man,
you farm faggot!

1096
01:41:53,995 --> 01:41:55,201
Shut your mouth!

1097
01:41:55,702 --> 01:41:57,618
I'm Trish. Rape me!

1098
01:41:57,910 --> 01:41:59,409
- Shut your mouth!
- Rape me!

1099
01:41:59,784 --> 01:42:01,617
You wanna be raped?
Is that what you want?
You wanna fucking be raped?

1100
01:42:02,909 --> 01:42:04,701
You wanna play games? OK!

1101
01:42:05,700 --> 01:42:06,574
This is 911.

1102
01:42:09,075 --> 01:42:10,283
This is 911.

1103
01:42:13,073 --> 01:42:14,281
Is this what you want?

1104
01:42:14,990 --> 01:42:15,988
I'm gonna rape you.

1105
01:42:16,488 --> 01:42:18,197
I'm gonna fucking rape you, bitch!

1106
01:42:18,573 --> 01:42:20,489
Miss, miss. I'm tracing your call right now.

1107
01:42:20,780 --> 01:42:21,863
You like it?

1108
01:42:22,154 --> 01:42:22,988
Don't you wanna be raped?

1109
01:42:23,279 --> 01:42:25,572
- You killed my husband!
- God-damn right!

1110
01:42:26,152 --> 01:42:27,569
You're God-damn right!

1111
01:42:27,986 --> 01:42:29,779
You killed my husband!

1112
01:42:30,445 --> 01:42:32,860
God-damn right I did!

1113
01:42:33,153 --> 01:42:36,151
Alright. Miss, miss? I have located you and
I have a car on the way.

1114
01:42:39,234 --> 01:42:41,566
- I'm Trish.
- Are you Trish? Fuck you!

1115
01:42:43,650 --> 01:42:47,231
Fuck, fucking bitch!
Fuck you!

1116
01:42:49,439 --> 01:42:50,524
Is that what you want?

1117
01:42:57,812 --> 01:42:59,312
You like it!

1118
01:43:26,391 --> 01:43:27,474
What'd you find out?

1119
01:43:27,808 --> 01:43:28,888
Lance Collier exists.

1120
01:43:29,181 --> 01:43:33,180
In fact he continues to exist.
He's the guy you described but he isn't dead.

1121
01:43:33,472 --> 01:43:36,971
Right, so she stole her husband's
money just like he told me.

1122
01:43:37,388 --> 01:43:41,470
But the husband never filed a complaint.
Look at the D.A.'s case Mike:

1123
01:43:41,887 --> 01:43:46,759
you go into a man's apartment with a gun and a knife.
That's intent to kill even if you hadn't confessed it.

1124
01:43:47,177 --> 01:43:49,967
The wife is there, your girlfriend.
That's motive.

1125
01:43:50,259 --> 01:43:53,343
There's a rape on Police tape, along with
a number of murderous threats

1126
01:43:53,967 --> 01:43:56,550
all of which goes to establish
a damn tight case.

1127
01:43:56,968 --> 01:43:59,339
She gave me the keys to the apartment.
She gave them to me!

1128
01:44:00,173 --> 01:44:04,339
They were copies of the originals she possessed.
The jury figures you could have had those made up
at any time.

1129
01:44:04,755 --> 01:44:05,340
But...

1130
01:44:05,548 --> 01:44:08,548
There's not a trace of anyone's fingerprints
on those keys but yours.

1131
01:44:09,048 --> 01:44:10,630
The mace was hers!

1132
01:44:11,130 --> 01:44:14,919
I believe you Mike.
But a jury's gonna be looking for elecrical outlets.

1133
01:44:17,545 --> 01:44:22,711
If we had one piece of hard evidence to support
your version of her maneuverings

1134
01:44:23,127 --> 01:44:25,334
that would be enought to raise reasonable doubt.

1135
01:44:25,918 --> 01:44:29,418
A note she wrote,
the plane ticket to Miami?

1136
01:44:29,835 --> 01:44:32,333
Phone calls. She made phone calls from my office.

1137
01:44:32,916 --> 01:44:37,915
Your office, and you made all but one of those calls.
She probably faked that one.

1138
01:44:38,999 --> 01:44:39,916
Believe me,

1139
01:44:40,124 --> 01:44:43,790
You don't want a jury to hear about that night.
THINK!

1140
01:44:53,079 --> 01:44:54,078
There might be one thing...

1141
01:46:15,103 --> 01:46:22,017
