1
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,834
Gentlemen...

2
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,367
We are gathered here today
as representatives...

3
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:37,437
of some of the greatest
design teams in the world.

4
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:39,467
We are here to listen
to a proposal...

5
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,868
from a Mr. X...

6
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:43,636
a man who is 50 years
ahead of his time...

7
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:46,035
A man who is undoubtedly...

8
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:48,535
the world's greatest
aircraft designer.

9
00:00:48,566 --> 00:00:50,100
The daddy of them all.

10
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,100
Mr. X?

11
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:53,001
Are you with us?

12
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:54,200
Yes...

13
00:00:54,233 --> 00:00:55,834
l am with you,
Mr. President.

14
00:00:55,866 --> 00:00:57,234
Gentlemen, you must
forgive the extraordinary...

15
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:00,102
security precautions
taken today.

16
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:02,435
But when l tell you
that Mr. X...

17
00:01:02,466 --> 00:01:04,301
is none other than
the man who designed...

18
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,268
the International
Rescue aircraft...

19
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,202
you will understand the
importance of security.

20
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:11,635
Mr. X has a proposition
to put to us...

21
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:14,668
for a revolutionary
new type of aircraft.

22
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,101
lt is, perhaps...

23
00:01:16,133 --> 00:01:19,703
The most exciting moment in
the history of our company.

24
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:22,669
And now, gentlemen,
the moment has come.

25
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,935
What is it to be?

26
00:01:24,966 --> 00:01:29,470
An aircraft that flies 10 times
the speed of sound...

27
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,070
A space vehicle that travels
the speed of light?

28
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,001
lf l were able to guess...

29
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:43,068
Mr. X would not
be here today.

30
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:45,869
And now, Mr. X, it is
with great excitement...

31
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,534
that we await breathlessly...

32
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,701
the details
of your new design.

33
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:51,901
Well, gentlemen...

34
00:01:51,933 --> 00:01:54,802
l thought it would be
a good idea...

35
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:58,336
in this day and age
of, uh, speed...

36
00:01:58,366 --> 00:02:01,168
And, uh, things like that...

37
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,103
to build an...airship.

38
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:09,434
An airship?

39
00:02:09,466 --> 00:02:11,000
An airship?

40
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:58,470
A beautiful island
in the pacific...

41
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,302
secret base of
International Rescue...

42
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,468
So far undetected.

43
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,203
Outwardly, the luxury home
of millionaire ex-astronaut...

44
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:09,001
Jeff Tracy.

45
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:11,135
Now, let's have a rundown...

46
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,167
on the International
Rescue craft.

47
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:15,268
At the moment, there are 5.

48
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:24,070
Thunderbird 1...
sleek, first, and fast.

49
00:03:26,433 --> 00:03:29,369
Thunderbird 2...
giant transporter.

50
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,869
Carries all the rescue
gear to the danger zone.

51
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,070
Thunderbird 3...
designed for space rescue.

52
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,068
Thunderbird 4...

53
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,902
capable of withstanding
the pressure of the depths.

54
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:52,902
Thunderbird 5...
space monitor.

55
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,734
Capable of receiving
or intercepting...

56
00:03:54,766 --> 00:03:57,368
distress calls from
any part of the world.

57
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:02,102
And l'm telling you, Brains,
in no uncertain terms...

58
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:05,202
That we now need
a Thunderbird 6.

59
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,801
Sure, Mr. Tracy.

60
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,335
But can you give me
some sort of a steer?

61
00:04:22,366 --> 00:04:24,401
l like to work
to a specification.

62
00:04:24,433 --> 00:04:26,268
Specification?

63
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,602
You didn't need to work
to a specification...

64
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:29,800
when you designed
that airship...

65
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,434
for the New World
Aircraft Corporation.

66
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:33,901
That's right. l didn't.

67
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:35,267
And what happened?

68
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,267
They laughed.

69
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,403
Yeah, that's right.
They laughed.

70
00:04:39,433 --> 00:04:41,034
And then they built it.

71
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:04,568
There you are, Brains.

72
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,070
Your specially commissioned
painting of Skyship 1.

73
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,901
Thanks, Virgil.

74
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:11,467
lt's really great.

75
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,735
But l guess that's
about the nearest...

76
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,001
l'm gonna get to it
for some time.

77
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:18,168
l'm sorry about this,
Brains.

78
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:20,635
But l've got this feeling,
and l know l'm not wrong.

79
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,869
We desperately need
a Thunderbird 6.

80
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:26,469
That's OH, Mr. Tracy.

81
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,268
Of course,
l would have liked...

82
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,768
to have been on
the maiden voyage.

83
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,568
Sure.

84
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,201
But at least
International Rescue...

85
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:36,035
will be represented by
Alan, Tin Tin, and Penelope.

86
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:38,134
They'll give you
a full report.

87
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,700
So, you like
the painting, eh?

88
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:41,401
Say, talking of painting...

89
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:44,733
Alan?

90
00:07:44,766 --> 00:07:45,967
Yes, Dad?

91
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,334
You better get cleaned up.

92
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,301
Don't forget, it's your
farewell dinner tonight.

93
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,568
Just 10 more minutes, Dad,
and l'll be through.

94
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,567
How's she looking?

95
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,235
Great. Just great.

96
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,401
l finished our
packing, Mr. Tracy.

97
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:59,134
Our packing?

98
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:02,102
Tin Tin, come here a minute.

99
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:03,801
Certainly, Mr. Tracy.

100
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,534
ls there anything wrong?

101
00:08:05,566 --> 00:08:08,669
Tin Tin, Alan wanted
to travel to England...

102
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:10,568
in an unconventional way.

103
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,668
Well, l've organized that.

104
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:14,635
But it's gonna be
a long journey...

105
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,968
and not exactly the way
for a young lady to travel...

106
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,368
in this day and age.

107
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:20,435
You are traveling
by scheduled airline.

108
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,701
But Mr. Tracy...

109
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:24,768
l want to travel with Alan.

110
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,601
Now, Alan leaves tomorrow...

111
00:08:26,633 --> 00:08:29,268
and you leave
in 2 weeks' time.

112
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,300
Understand?

113
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:50,934
Come on, Mother, over here.

114
00:08:50,966 --> 00:08:52,567
You'll get a good view.

115
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,301
Well, l guess we've seen
a lot of launchings...

116
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,934
but this will beat all.

117
00:08:57,966 --> 00:08:59,300
Say, where's Tin Tin?

118
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,701
l don't know, Dad.

119
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:02,000
Strange.

120
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:04,535
Unusual for her
not to see Alan off.

121
00:09:20,133 --> 00:09:21,234
Here she comes.

122
00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:42,634
So long, folks.

123
00:10:31,366 --> 00:10:33,367
Dearest Brains...

124
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,969
l know how much
this project means to you...

125
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,336
and l feel that you, not l,
should be making this trip.

126
00:10:39,366 --> 00:10:43,503
But, of course, you are the one
person who cannot be spared.

127
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:47,270
l shall be thinking of you.
Love, Tin Tin.

128
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,234
P.S...

129
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:52,534
l stowed aboard
the Tiger with Alan.

130
00:10:52,566 --> 00:10:54,434
She's what?

131
00:10:54,466 --> 00:10:56,801
That's right, Mr. Tracy.

132
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,935
She's aboard
the Tiger with Alan.

133
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,002
He flies through the air

134
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:12,568
With the greatest of ease

135
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,504
The daring young man
in his flying machine

136
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:20,235
His movements are graceful

137
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:22,835
All girls he can please

138
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:27,370
And my heart is stolen away

139
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,368
lsn't it a lovely ou_it?

140
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:31,337
lt belonged to my ancestor,
the Duchess of Crighton Ward.

141
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:33,634
Well? What do you think,
Parker?

142
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:37,636
l think it's very elegant,
milady.

143
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:40,935
Mind you, l prefer
mini-skirts m'self...

144
00:12:40,966 --> 00:12:43,068
but l suppose
it's appropriate...

145
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,035
that you should be dressed
like that...

146
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:48,235
For the revival of
the airship, so to speak.

147
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:49,834
Thank you, Parker.

148
00:12:49,866 --> 00:12:52,268
And that ou_it
suits you beautifully.

149
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:53,968
Well, if Alan's
on schedule...

150
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,568
he should be arriving
at any moment.

151
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,268
Yes, milady.

152
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:00,102
l understand that he's been
on his way now for 2 weeks.

153
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,734
That's him, Parker.

154
00:13:05,766 --> 00:13:08,568
We must go onto the roof
and see him land.

155
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,435
Come on.

156
00:13:10,466 --> 00:13:13,035
There it is, Tin Tin.

157
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:18,037
Yes, Alan!
It looks lovely!

158
00:13:18,066 --> 00:13:20,635
OH. You know what to do.

159
00:13:30,766 --> 00:13:33,435
l expect he's
coming in to land.

160
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:43,402
Milady, he's coming
straight for us!

161
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:00,602
l don't believe it.

162
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,568
Hi, Penny. Hi, Parker.

163
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,502
Alan, l'm so glad
you're safe.

164
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:10,568
You gave us quite a scare.

165
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,635
Gee, l like
your ou_it, Penelope.

166
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,901
Yes, l was rather
pleased with it myself.

167
00:14:23,766 --> 00:14:25,601
Uh, uh, excuse me.

168
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:27,001
All the family
send their love to you.

169
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,568
Uh, excuse me,
Mr. Alan. Excuse me.

170
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,701
What is it, Parker?

171
00:14:30,733 --> 00:14:34,369
Uh, your aircraft, sir.
It's got no pilot.

172
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,202
l--l just thought
l'd point it out to you, sir.

173
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:38,500
Oh, forget about it,
Parker.

174
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:40,101
l'm finished with it now.

175
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:41,267
Now, you were saying,
Penelope...

176
00:14:55,533 --> 00:14:58,335
Mr. Alan, please!
Don't you understand?

177
00:14:58,366 --> 00:15:00,267
lt's gonna crash
into the house!

178
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,269
Parker! What has
got into you?

179
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:06,234
Sorry about that, Alan.

180
00:15:38,866 --> 00:15:41,468
Stone the crows...

181
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,736
lt's going to land
on its own.

182
00:15:44,766 --> 00:15:45,733
Parker? Milady?

183
00:15:45,766 --> 00:15:48,301
Tin Tin's
an excellent pilot.

184
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,701
Don't you think, Parker?

185
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,535
You should have seen
Parker's face, Tin Tin.

186
00:16:11,566 --> 00:16:14,969
lt was the funniest thing
l've ever seen in my life.

187
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,869
l can just imagine it.

188
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:21,136
Of course, l saw immediately
what Alan was up to

189
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,834
because l knew
you were on board.

190
00:16:22,866 --> 00:16:24,434
Jeff called me yesterday.

191
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:27,001
l could hardly
keep a straight face.

192
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:29,133
Come in.

193
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,601
All the baggage
is aboard, milady.

194
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:35,034
Thank you, Parker.

195
00:16:35,066 --> 00:16:38,803
Now, there's only one thing
Ieft to do before we leave.

196
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,301
Bon voyage.

197
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:42,600
Bon voyage.

198
00:16:42,633 --> 00:16:45,869
Bon voyage, milady.

199
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:53,703
As president of the New
World Aircraft Corporation...

200
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:56,469
this flight is of paramount
importance to me.

201
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,702
The fact that members
of International Rescue...

202
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:00,301
will be on
the maiden flight...

203
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,802
enables us to achieve
worldwide publicity.

204
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,168
ln order to make this
possible in the first place...

205
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,468
we have given
assurances to them...

206
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,034
that the strictest
security arrangements...

207
00:17:09,066 --> 00:17:10,400
will be enforced.

208
00:17:10,433 --> 00:17:12,401
That is why the airfield is
cleared of all personnel.

209
00:17:12,433 --> 00:17:16,770
The passengers are due
to arrive in, um...

210
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,234
30 minutes.

211
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,101
Contact.

212
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,002
Virg, l can see them
at 2 o'clock!

213
00:18:28,033 --> 00:18:30,702
OH. l've got them, Scott.

214
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:32,167
Right.

215
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,535
Operation escort, go!

216
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:02,104
This is what l call
driving in style, milady.

217
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:07,004
lt isn't every Rolls-Royce
that has an aircraft escort.

218
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:23,535
OH, all checks complete.

219
00:19:23,566 --> 00:19:24,967
-Martin?
-Yes, sir.

220
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,668
-Lane?
-Yes, sir.

221
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,201
-Carter?
-Yes, sir.

222
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:29,467
-Hogarth?
-Yes, sir.

223
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,102
OH. Return to your posts...

224
00:19:32,133 --> 00:19:33,801
and await the arrival
of the passengers.

225
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,134
Hold it right there.

226
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:43,667
Quickly, we haven't much time.

227
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,201
Scott from Penelope.

228
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:45,802
Come aboard with the others
and have a farewell drink.

229
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,501
We'll meet you
in the ballroom.

230
00:20:47,533 --> 00:20:48,634
The ballroom!

231
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,734
May l book
the first dance?

232
00:20:50,766 --> 00:20:53,101
No, Scott.
It isn't what it seems.

233
00:20:53,133 --> 00:20:54,300
You'll see.

234
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,669
And now, by the courtesy...

235
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,369
of the New World
Aircraft Corporation...

236
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,204
we bring you the
Drinking Half Hour!

237
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:08,069
Now, milady,
what will it be?

238
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:11,436
l think this occasion
calls for champagne...

239
00:21:11,466 --> 00:21:12,667
all around, Parker.

240
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,401
All around, milady?

241
00:21:14,433 --> 00:21:16,968
All around, Parker.

242
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,868
And now,
Iadies and gentlemen...

243
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,602
on behalf of the New World
Aircraft Corporation...

244
00:21:29,633 --> 00:21:32,836
l welcome you aboard
Skyship 1.

245
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:35,802
As you know, this is
the maiden flight.

246
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,801
lt is, of course,
a great honor...

247
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,435
for us to have such
distinguished guests.

248
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:43,936
You can be assured that
the crew and myself...

249
00:21:43,966 --> 00:21:45,467
will do everything
in our power...

250
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,269
to make this
a trip to remember.

251
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:52,570
Well, bon voyage.

252
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:53,567
Bon voyage!

253
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:55,568
Godspeed, milady.

254
00:22:08,966 --> 00:22:11,568
OH, one minute to takeoff.

255
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:14,903
Now, we know the ship
is fully automated.

256
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,901
Everything is
preprogrammed--

257
00:22:16,933 --> 00:22:18,968
height, speed, course.

258
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,335
We're all supposed to be
trained men.

259
00:22:21,366 --> 00:22:23,434
The only way that our cover
will be broken...

260
00:22:23,466 --> 00:22:25,568
will be if anything
goes wrong with the ship.

261
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:27,268
Takeoff now, 30 seconds.

262
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,067
Well, we're off.

263
00:24:34,366 --> 00:24:35,400
Come in.

264
00:24:37,866 --> 00:24:40,235
Dinner is served in the
bottle room, milady.

265
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:00,834
Well, they've gone.

266
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,968
May we have the blinds
drawn, Captain?

267
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,202
The entire operation
of this Skyship...

268
00:25:05,233 --> 00:25:07,668
Lady Penelope, is
totally automatic.

269
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:12,604
As the light falls, the curtains
will draw automatically.

270
00:25:12,633 --> 00:25:13,600
Of course.

271
00:25:13,633 --> 00:25:14,600
That's just
the sort of thing...

272
00:25:14,633 --> 00:25:16,167
Brains would have thought of.

273
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,969
Well, it looks as if
we're all set

274
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,869
for a lovely,
peaceful holiday.

275
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:51,734
Calling Black Phantom.

276
00:25:51,766 --> 00:25:53,267
This is White Ghost.

277
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:58,038
Calling Black Phantom,
this is White Ghost.

278
00:25:58,066 --> 00:25:59,834
Come in, Black Phantom.

279
00:25:59,866 --> 00:26:03,436
Come in, Black Phantom.

280
00:26:03,466 --> 00:26:05,935
Have disposed of cargo.

281
00:26:05,966 --> 00:26:09,502
Operation Ambush underway.

282
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:25,335
Calling
International Rescue.

283
00:26:25,366 --> 00:26:27,067
This is Lady Penelope.

284
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:30,670
Jeff, l want you to send
Thunderbird 1 and 2...

285
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,268
to a disused airfield...

286
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,435
10 miles south
of Casablanca.

287
00:26:34,466 --> 00:26:40,171
lnternational fix system
24-04. Reference E.

288
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,137
Ensure that Brains is aboard.
This is imperative.

289
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:47,068
Do not acknowledge
this transmission.

290
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:48,968
Will call later
with further details.

291
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,102
lt's going
to be difficult.

292
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:52,767
That's what
we're paid for.

293
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,801
Now, l've had this
whole place bugged.

294
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:57,135
l want every word she
speaks on this trip...

295
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:58,400
to be recorded.

296
00:26:58,433 --> 00:27:00,334
Whenever possible,
l'll talk to her myself...

297
00:27:00,366 --> 00:27:01,467
and maneuver
the conversation...

298
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,801
in the right direction.

299
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:04,568
Right. Get to work.

300
00:27:43,466 --> 00:27:45,201
OH, Carter,
breakfast is served.

301
00:27:45,233 --> 00:27:46,434
Start recording.

302
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:48,600
Morning, Alan.

303
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:49,600
Morning, Penny.

304
00:27:49,633 --> 00:27:50,600
Morning, Alan.

305
00:27:50,633 --> 00:27:52,267
Breakfast over New York.

306
00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:53,567
What an experience.

307
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:57,270
This is really
the way to travel.

308
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:58,701
Yeah, it's great.

309
00:27:58,733 --> 00:28:01,569
Only thing is, as the
ship's fully automated...

310
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:03,969
if anything should go
wrong with the computer...

311
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,135
we could hit one of
these skyscrapers...

312
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:07,700
and then we'd really
be in trouble.

313
00:28:07,733 --> 00:28:09,267
Then, Alan...

314
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:11,435
it would just be
a simple case of...

315
00:28:11,466 --> 00:28:13,601
calling
International Rescue.

316
00:28:15,733 --> 00:28:17,334
OH.

317
00:28:17,366 --> 00:28:19,701
Calling International Rescue.

318
00:28:37,066 --> 00:28:38,934
And now, gentlemen...

319
00:28:38,966 --> 00:28:44,838
it is with pride that l
present to you Thunderbird 6.

320
00:28:44,866 --> 00:28:47,168
Now, so that l'm able
to demonstrate...

321
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,868
this new machine properly...

322
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,736
l have built this
radio-controlled model.

323
00:28:51,766 --> 00:28:54,201
The situation?

324
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:57,669
Man trapped in top floor
of burning skyscraper.

325
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,570
Thunderbird 6
drives up to the building.

326
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:04,369
The helium balloon
now rises...

327
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,169
lifting a plastic hose
into the air.

328
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,902
When the balloon reaches
the correct height...

329
00:29:09,933 --> 00:29:12,568
the reel is locked off.

330
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:14,902
l don't get it, Brains.
What's the point?

331
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:18,303
This is the point.

332
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:39,302
And so you see, gentlemen...

333
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:43,003
another international rescue
is made possible.

334
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:48,569
Well, Mr. Tracy,
what do you think?

335
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:53,037
Well, it's, uh, certainly
ingenious, Brains.

336
00:29:53,066 --> 00:29:55,067
But it means
building a vehicle...

337
00:29:55,099 --> 00:29:57,335
that gives us only
one means of rescue.

338
00:29:57,366 --> 00:30:01,403
The end product just doesn't
justi_ the cost.

339
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:03,635
l--l'm sorry.

340
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:05,234
l'm afraid you'll
have to scrap it...

341
00:30:05,266 --> 00:30:06,700
and start again.

342
00:30:06,733 --> 00:30:08,534
Too bad about
the wasted effort.

343
00:30:08,566 --> 00:30:10,901
Wasted effort, Mr. Tracy?

344
00:30:10,933 --> 00:30:14,903
Heh heh.
What's a mere 28 days...

345
00:30:14,933 --> 00:30:17,435
Working day and night...

346
00:30:17,466 --> 00:30:20,302
Think nothing of it.

347
00:30:29,099 --> 00:30:32,870
We must be descending.
l'm getting butterflies.

348
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,269
l always do
when we lose height.

349
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:37,168
You're absolutely right,
Lady Penelope.

350
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,135
We'll soon be flying
over the Grand Canyon...

351
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:40,133
at zero feet.

352
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:41,800
An automated announcement...

353
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:43,568
will tell us when
it's the right time.

354
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:46,035
Don't worry,
you won't miss a thing.

355
00:30:46,066 --> 00:30:49,102
There. You can see
our exact position.

356
00:30:49,133 --> 00:30:51,368
The Grand Canyon.

357
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,201
You know, l was once
hopelessly lost...

358
00:30:53,233 --> 00:30:54,968
in a jet plane,
and then, at last...

359
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,735
l made contact
with the Grand.

360
00:30:56,766 --> 00:30:58,634
Was l glad to hear
that voice!

361
00:30:58,666 --> 00:31:01,835
You are directly over
the Grand Canyon.

362
00:31:01,866 --> 00:31:03,867
Your position
International fix system

363
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,869
24-24, Reference E.

364
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,768
Correction, Captain Foster.

365
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:13,771
lnternational fix system
24-04. Reference E.

366
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:16,769
Of course. 24-04.

367
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,302
Heh. l didn't think
l'd ever forget that.

368
00:31:21,233 --> 00:31:22,200
Ladies and gentlemen...

369
00:31:22,233 --> 00:31:24,335
we are now approaching
the Grand Canyon.

370
00:31:24,366 --> 00:31:27,268
lf you care to take up your
positions on the balcony...

371
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:28,267
you will be in good time...

372
00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:30,769
to get the most
advantageous view point.

373
00:32:13,466 --> 00:32:17,603
l think it's the most
beautiful sight l've ever seen.

374
00:32:17,633 --> 00:32:20,068
Come across to the
other side of the ship.

375
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:21,968
There's an even better
view over there.

376
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,868
Yes, let's do that.

377
00:32:40,633 --> 00:32:43,435
l really don't think
l like Captain Foster.

378
00:32:43,466 --> 00:32:45,401
Ah, he's just an old man.

379
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,568
Thunderbirds 1 and 2...

380
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:26,369
l trust the beaujolais was
to your liking, Parker?

381
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,469
And now, how about a cigar?

382
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:58,068
As you know, milady...

383
00:33:58,099 --> 00:34:00,235
l've been spending
quite a lot of time...

384
00:34:00,266 --> 00:34:01,900
with the stewards...

385
00:34:01,933 --> 00:34:04,235
drinking and all
that sort of thing.

386
00:34:04,266 --> 00:34:06,067
Well, what worries me--

387
00:34:06,099 --> 00:34:08,402
they--they don't seem
to know as much...

388
00:34:08,433 --> 00:34:09,801
about the ship
as they ought to.

389
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:11,467
Thank you, Parker.

390
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,902
l've had my own thoughts
on the matter.

391
00:34:13,933 --> 00:34:15,734
l'm glad you told me.

392
00:34:15,766 --> 00:34:18,068
Yes. Well, uh--

393
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:20,068
sorry if l disturbed
you, milady.

394
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,068
You were quite right,
Parker.

395
00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:23,100
Good night.

396
00:34:23,133 --> 00:34:24,767
Good night, milady.

397
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:40,401
Yes, Penelope?

398
00:34:40,433 --> 00:34:42,535
l've just had some
information from Parker.

399
00:34:42,566 --> 00:34:44,901
l'm a little uneasy.

400
00:34:44,933 --> 00:34:47,268
Tell me, what do you
think of Captain Foster?

401
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,235
l don't go for him,
Penelope.

402
00:34:49,266 --> 00:34:51,401
He's a little too smooth
for my liking.

403
00:34:51,433 --> 00:34:53,735
Tell me, Alan, has he
been questioning you...

404
00:34:53,766 --> 00:34:55,234
about International Rescue?

405
00:34:55,266 --> 00:34:57,401
As a matter of fact, he has.

406
00:34:57,433 --> 00:34:59,001
Well, not directly, mind you...

407
00:34:59,033 --> 00:35:00,801
but the conversation always
seems to lead that way.

408
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:03,335
l think we'll have to go
into the situation...

409
00:35:03,366 --> 00:35:05,167
a little more closely.

410
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:06,868
l don't like
the sound of it.

411
00:35:12,533 --> 00:35:14,568
The storm seems
to be getting worse.

412
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:16,501
l think you'd
better come in here.

413
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:18,234
We need to discuss this
right away.

414
00:35:24,866 --> 00:35:26,334
Oh, well, um...

415
00:35:26,366 --> 00:35:28,835
Perhaps we are allowing
our imaginations...

416
00:35:28,866 --> 00:35:31,335
to run away with us.
After all...

417
00:35:31,366 --> 00:35:34,168
everyone's interested
in International Rescue.

418
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:36,502
lt's only natural
he should ask questions.

419
00:35:36,533 --> 00:35:38,568
Oh. So you don't think
there's anything...

420
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:39,901
to worry about, Penelope?

421
00:35:39,933 --> 00:35:43,336
No. After all, they have
all been screened.

422
00:35:43,366 --> 00:35:45,468
They're carefully
selected men.

423
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,502
That was a close one.
Put on the edited tape.

424
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:50,167
Right.

425
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:51,501
One thing's for sure.

426
00:35:51,533 --> 00:35:54,836
We gotta play this
really cool from now on.

427
00:35:54,866 --> 00:35:57,568
Lady Penelope,
l underestimated you.

428
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,936
Calling International Rescue.

429
00:36:00,966 --> 00:36:05,136
Jeff, l want you to send
Thunderbirds 1 and 2.

430
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,435
lnternational
fix system.

431
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:12,436
24-04. Reference E.

432
00:36:12,466 --> 00:36:15,068
OH. Continue recording.

433
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,936
Doesn't sound as if we'll
get much more tonight.

434
00:36:21,966 --> 00:36:24,268
When l was talking to you
just now, Alan...

435
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:28,103
l discovered a bugging device
in a lamp by my bed.

436
00:36:28,133 --> 00:36:30,101
l wondered why you'd
changed your attitude...

437
00:36:30,133 --> 00:36:32,935
so abruptly.
What's our next move?

438
00:36:32,966 --> 00:36:34,767
For the moment, nothing.

439
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,936
We know we're being bugged,
but we don't know why.

440
00:36:37,966 --> 00:36:39,767
We must just be on the alert.

441
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,868
OH. l'll mosey around...

442
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,234
and see what
l can find out.

443
00:36:44,633 --> 00:36:49,104
Of course l understand,
Mr. Tracy.

444
00:36:49,133 --> 00:36:52,769
lt isn't quite the thing
you had in mind.

445
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,037
Of course l don't mind
designing yet another one.

446
00:36:57,066 --> 00:36:58,967
You know, Scott, one
of the remarkable things...

447
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,203
about Brains is that he
never loses his temper.

448
00:37:02,233 --> 00:37:04,034
Well, if he did,
l wouldn't blame him...

449
00:37:04,066 --> 00:37:05,600
after all the work he's done.

450
00:37:05,633 --> 00:37:08,702
Upset? Me upset?

451
00:37:08,733 --> 00:37:10,468
Of course l'm not upset!

452
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,368
Go ahead, John.

453
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,701
Father, l've just
received a message...

454
00:37:22,733 --> 00:37:23,867
from Lady Penelope.

455
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,768
lt was sent in scrambled
electronic code.

456
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,034
Right, John. Let's have it.

457
00:37:27,066 --> 00:37:29,368
lt's just coming out
of the descrambler now.

458
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,871
lt reads, ''Ship bugged.
Reason unknown.

459
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,036
''Am investigating.

460
00:37:37,066 --> 00:37:40,869
''lmperative, no
communication from you.

461
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:45,537
''Will contact you
when we have a lead.

462
00:37:45,566 --> 00:37:46,700
''Signed, Penelope.''

463
00:37:46,733 --> 00:37:48,701
F.A.B., John. Heep in touch.

464
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,868
l don't like
the sound of it, Dad.

465
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,868
We've gotta do
something about this.

466
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,701
Yeah. But what?

467
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:57,034
Well, why not
radio the police...

468
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,467
at their next port of call?

469
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,134
Have the crew interrogated.

470
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:02,134
No. Whoever it is
on that ship...

471
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:04,134
that is looking
for information...

472
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:07,135
is probably an agent for
a larger organization.

473
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:08,800
lf we're to protect
ourselves, we've gotta...

474
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:10,701
wait for them
to show their hand.

475
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:19,305
You lead an interesting
but secretive life.

476
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:25,872
Your lifeline shows that you
will meet many dangers.

477
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:35,808
You will become involved
with a handsome stranger.

478
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:41,004
You would be well to let
your heart guide you.

479
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:23,236
Well...stone the crows.

480
00:39:24,433 --> 00:39:26,902
Beautiful, Alan.

481
00:39:26,933 --> 00:39:28,901
But it's far
too expensive.

482
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,734
Right. We'll take it.

483
00:39:30,766 --> 00:39:33,235
You won't regret it, sir.

484
00:39:33,266 --> 00:39:35,568
lt will bring you
much happiness.

485
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,902
Oh, Alan, it's been
such a lovely day.

486
00:39:37,933 --> 00:39:39,934
l just wish it
could never end.

487
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,069
The sari suits you
very well, Penelope.

488
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,403
lt was a very kind thought,
Captain. Thank you.

489
00:39:56,433 --> 00:39:58,902
Did you get anything
interesting today, Tin Tin?

490
00:39:58,933 --> 00:40:01,735
Yes. Alan bought me
this beautiful ring.

491
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:03,567
He paid far too much
money for it...

492
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:04,801
but l'm very thrilled with it.

493
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:07,235
Buying a ring for a young
Iady is prem significant...

494
00:40:07,266 --> 00:40:09,568
to me, Alan. Don't tell me
you're going to desert...

495
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:10,968
the league of bachelors.

496
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,235
l'm afraid not,
Captain Foster.

497
00:40:13,266 --> 00:40:15,735
The life l lead in
International Rescue...

498
00:40:15,766 --> 00:40:17,567
is far too dangerous
to ask anyone...

499
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:18,901
to share it with me.

500
00:40:18,933 --> 00:40:21,268
For me, at the moment, marriage
is out of the question.

501
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,068
That's right,
Captain Foster.

502
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:25,068
We all of us lead
dedicated lives...

503
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:26,901
in International Rescue.

504
00:40:26,933 --> 00:40:31,237
And now, if you'll excuse me,
l think l'll retire.

505
00:40:31,266 --> 00:40:33,034
But wouldn't you
like another drink?

506
00:40:33,066 --> 00:40:35,401
Thank you, Captain, but no.

507
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,402
lt's been a lovely,
but very tiring day.

508
00:40:38,433 --> 00:40:40,234
l'm going to bed.

509
00:40:40,266 --> 00:40:41,567
Oh, so soon?

510
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,236
l'm afraid so.
Good night, everyone.

511
00:40:45,266 --> 00:40:47,368
So, your rooms aren't bugged...

512
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,402
but the lounge, bar,
and dining room are.

513
00:40:50,433 --> 00:40:54,069
All places where l go.
It would seem it's me...

514
00:40:54,099 --> 00:40:56,235
they want the
information from.

515
00:40:56,266 --> 00:40:57,667
But what?

516
00:40:57,699 --> 00:41:00,669
lf we knew that, we'd know
the answer to everything.

517
00:41:00,699 --> 00:41:02,835
Have you found any trace
of the receiver?

518
00:41:02,866 --> 00:41:04,167
Parker's had no luck.

519
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:06,502
None. The only place
l haven't searched...

520
00:41:06,533 --> 00:41:08,167
is the gravity
compensation room.

521
00:41:12,233 --> 00:41:15,502
Well, the trip comes to
an end in 14 days' time.

522
00:41:15,533 --> 00:41:17,167
Whatever move
they're going to make...

523
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:20,002
must be made before we
get back to England.

524
00:41:20,033 --> 00:41:21,768
So we'll soon know.

525
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:44,501
l think l can claim to
have been to most places...

526
00:41:44,533 --> 00:41:46,167
in the world,
but, oddly enough...

527
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:48,168
l've never seen the pyramids.

528
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:49,834
l've never seen them, either.

529
00:41:49,866 --> 00:41:51,133
Well, we won't
have long to wait.

530
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:53,334
We land in 15 minutes.

531
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:10,535
Oh, how dreadful.

532
00:42:10,566 --> 00:42:12,000
What is it, Penelope?

533
00:42:12,033 --> 00:42:14,435
There's been
a terrible air crash.

534
00:42:14,466 --> 00:42:16,301
A DX 102 airliner...

535
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:19,102
tried to make a forced
Ianding on a disused...

536
00:42:19,133 --> 00:42:21,768
airfield 10 miles
south of Casablanca.

537
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,268
lts nose wheel collapsed...

538
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,935
and the aircraft blew
up, killing all aboard.

539
00:42:25,966 --> 00:42:28,401
At last, we've got it.

540
00:42:28,433 --> 00:42:29,901
l've got to hand it
to you, Carter...

541
00:42:29,933 --> 00:42:33,436
that newspaper idea
of yours was just great.

542
00:42:33,466 --> 00:42:35,434
Now, complete the editing.

543
00:42:35,466 --> 00:42:37,935
l want to hear that final
message as soon as possible.

544
00:42:37,966 --> 00:42:39,400
OH, girls, let's go.

545
00:42:39,433 --> 00:42:41,201
Don't forget your
camera, Penelope.

546
00:42:41,233 --> 00:42:43,635
Don't worry. l've
got it right here.

547
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:07,869
So, you see, Jeff,
we nearly lost Parker.

548
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:11,203
Ah, now here's the coded bit.

549
00:43:11,233 --> 00:43:13,868
We are enjoying our trip
and looking forward...

550
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:17,036
to our last port of call,
Switzerland.

551
00:43:17,066 --> 00:43:19,034
Scott, take this along
to Brain's lab...

552
00:43:19,066 --> 00:43:20,367
and get it decoded.

553
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,768
Yes, sir.

554
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,370
Oh, that's all right,
Mr. Tracy.

555
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,137
l just love having
my designs turned down.

556
00:43:34,066 --> 00:43:37,369
Gee, Brains,
your beautiful model.

557
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,202
Oh, h-hi, Scott.

558
00:43:40,233 --> 00:43:43,302
Yeah. It just slipped
out of my hand.

559
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:45,601
Dad wants you to decode
this right away.

560
00:43:45,633 --> 00:43:48,702
Gee, l wish there was something
we could do to help them.

561
00:43:48,733 --> 00:43:50,034
Don't worry.
l've got a feeling...

562
00:43:50,066 --> 00:43:51,333
it won't be long now.

563
00:43:51,366 --> 00:43:52,867
Mr. Tracy?

564
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,934
Yes, Brains?

565
00:43:53,966 --> 00:43:57,803
Decoding of Penelope's
Ietter is as follows...

566
00:43:57,833 --> 00:44:03,305
''lnterest is in me.
Reason unknown.

567
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:05,635
''Continue to stand by.''

568
00:44:05,666 --> 00:44:07,300
Thanks, Brains.

569
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:10,936
Well, we now know that they're
bugging only Penelope.

570
00:44:10,966 --> 00:44:13,001
They're interested
in what she says.

571
00:44:13,033 --> 00:44:14,968
Now, what could
Penelope say...

572
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,135
that would mean so much
to someone with designs...

573
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:18,934
on International Rescue?

574
00:44:18,966 --> 00:44:20,467
Jeff, l want you to send...

575
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:24,303
Thunderbirds 1 and 2
to a disused airfield...

576
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:26,968
10 miles south
of Casablanca.

577
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,739
lnternational fix system.
24-04. Reference E.

578
00:44:32,766 --> 00:44:35,135
Ensure that Brains is aboard.

579
00:44:35,166 --> 00:44:36,967
This is imperative.

580
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,635
Do not acknowledge
this transmission.

581
00:44:39,666 --> 00:44:41,801
Will call later
with further details.

582
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:44,302
Perfect. Just perfect.

583
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:46,301
OH. Now, what next?

584
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:47,967
Now, watch carefully.

585
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,503
Tomorrow, we make our
Iast stop--Switzerland.

586
00:45:12,566 --> 00:45:16,469
lt certainly is a fantastic
car you have, Penelope.

587
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,269
The only one of its kind in
the world, Captain Foster.

588
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,568
When those skis appeared
out of the bottom...

589
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,635
l just couldn't
believe my eyes.

590
00:45:23,666 --> 00:45:26,568
Oh, it has many other
devices, Captain.

591
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:29,402
Many of them
still top secret.

592
00:45:29,433 --> 00:45:32,102
Switching to full
boost, milady.

593
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:50,967
How are you doing, Tin Tin?

594
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,937
Fine. Just fine.

595
00:45:54,966 --> 00:45:56,801
Switch in thrusters.

596
00:45:56,833 --> 00:45:58,267
OH.

597
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,602
Right, have you decided what
you're going to eat?

598
00:47:00,633 --> 00:47:04,136
Mmm. l think l'll
start with avocado.

599
00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:08,067
Tin Tin?

600
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:09,534
Artichoke, please.

601
00:47:09,566 --> 00:47:10,600
Likewise.

602
00:47:10,633 --> 00:47:15,304
Ah. And for me the speciality
of the house.

603
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:16,967
This is a cute place.

604
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,768
lt's certainly imaginative.

605
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,401
Let's hope the service
is as good.

606
00:47:22,466 --> 00:47:24,367
Well, l guess
this is for us.

607
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,468
Gee, what a novel idea.

608
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,635
lt must have been fun
traveling in trains...

609
00:47:36,666 --> 00:47:38,267
like this years ago.

610
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:39,934
Well, let's unload the cargo.

611
00:47:39,966 --> 00:47:43,536
As Parker would say,
''lt looks a real good nosh.''

612
00:47:43,566 --> 00:47:46,435
Talking of Parker...
what's happened to him?

613
00:47:46,466 --> 00:47:48,768
Surely he's not
still outside?

614
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,268
But, of course.

615
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,468
The car is heated,
you know.

616
00:48:42,933 --> 00:48:45,368
11 :OO. We must go.

617
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,369
The skyship is programmed
to take off at midnight.

618
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,368
As a matter of interest,
Captain...

619
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,202
what would happen if you
didn't get back on time?

620
00:48:53,233 --> 00:48:56,469
Your dream holiday would
just come to an end.

621
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,102
And now, Cinderella,
we must go.

622
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:30,302
Are we clear, Parker?

623
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:32,301
Quite clear, milady.

624
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:34,301
You debugged the whole
place, Parker?

625
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:37,969
No need, milady. It was
already done for me.

626
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,969
There's not a hidden
microphone anywhere, milady.

627
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,968
They've all been removed.

628
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,801
That can only
mean one thing.

629
00:49:44,833 --> 00:49:47,802
They've got the information
they wanted. What now?

630
00:49:47,833 --> 00:49:50,468
Parker, what have you
to report?

631
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:51,968
Well, milady,

632
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,469
they've been recording
you on a tape machine...

633
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,969
in the gravity
compensation room.

634
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,135
l managed to get
a look in there.

635
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:01,968
They've been editing the
tape--that was obvious.

636
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,135
And now they've got
the tape machine...

637
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:06,801
linked to a radio
transmitter.

638
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:09,969
The jigsaw's nearly
completed but not quite.

639
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,968
Parker, issue the guns.

640
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,301
They're in the false
compartment...

641
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:15,468
at the bottom
of my blue suitcase.

642
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,870
From now on, it's
emergency standby.

643
00:50:21,666 --> 00:50:23,467
Black Phantom
from White Ghost.

644
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:27,036
Message will be transmitted
1000 hours tomorrow morning.

645
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:30,536
Gentlemen,
the Thunderbird machines...

646
00:50:30,566 --> 00:50:32,901
will be arriving here
at approximately...

647
00:50:32,933 --> 00:50:36,636
1100 hours
tomorrow morning.

648
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:42,338
The final phase of Operation
Ambush has commenced.

649
00:51:00,633 --> 00:51:03,902
OH. Rewind and stand by.

650
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:10,233
OH. Ready.

651
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,634
15 seconds.

652
00:51:21,233 --> 00:51:25,236
Calling International Rescue.
This is Lady Penelope.

653
00:51:25,266 --> 00:51:28,402
Jeff, l want you to send
Thunderbirds 1 and 2...

654
00:51:28,433 --> 00:51:30,234
to a disused airfield...

655
00:51:30,266 --> 00:51:32,401
10 miles south
of Casablanca.

656
00:51:32,433 --> 00:51:37,404
lnternational fix system.
24-04. Reference E.

657
00:51:37,433 --> 00:51:39,568
Ensure that Brains is aboard.

658
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,401
This is imperative.

659
00:51:41,433 --> 00:51:43,568
Do not acknowledge
this transmission.

660
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,135
Will call later
with further details.

661
00:52:29,633 --> 00:52:33,003
The Thunderbird machines
should be arriving...

662
00:52:33,033 --> 00:52:36,002
in approximately
10 minutes.

663
00:52:36,033 --> 00:52:37,501
Stand by.

664
00:52:37,533 --> 00:52:42,337
lf pilots offer any resistance
as they leave their machines...

665
00:52:42,366 --> 00:52:44,201
shoot them down.

666
00:53:09,633 --> 00:53:11,768
l've got it.
Penelope, l've got!

667
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,768
lt's the only
possible answer.

668
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,201
They've been recording
your voice, right?

669
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:16,200
Right.

670
00:53:16,233 --> 00:53:17,934
They've been editing
the tape, right?

671
00:53:17,966 --> 00:53:18,933
Right.

672
00:53:18,966 --> 00:53:20,600
Editing is a form
of rearranging.

673
00:53:20,633 --> 00:53:22,768
They've been
rearranging your words...

674
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,435
to make you say something
that they wanted you to say...

675
00:53:25,466 --> 00:53:27,267
and then they've
transmitted it.

676
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,267
Now, who's the one person...

677
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:30,101
who would act
on your instructions?

678
00:53:30,133 --> 00:53:32,468
Why, Jeff Tracy.

679
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,101
Roger, Scott.

680
00:53:34,133 --> 00:53:36,768
Understand that you are
at disused airfield.

681
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,967
Call me as soon
as you've landed.

682
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,034
F.A.B.

683
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,768
Go ahead, Penny.

684
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,269
Jeff, this is
an emergency.

685
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,435
Have you received
a message from me?

686
00:53:48,466 --> 00:53:50,768
Yes, Penelope. The boys
are just about to land...

687
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,067
at the rendezvous
you requested.

688
00:53:52,099 --> 00:53:55,269
Jeff, l haven't
sent a message.

689
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,035
This is a trap.

690
00:54:31,733 --> 00:54:33,201
Now, remember...

691
00:54:33,233 --> 00:54:37,036
just one sign of resistance
from those pilots...

692
00:54:37,066 --> 00:54:38,967
and let them have it.

693
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,435
Thunderbird to base.

694
00:55:54,466 --> 00:55:55,633
Thanks, Dad.

695
00:55:55,666 --> 00:55:57,734
You gave us the warning
just in time.

696
00:55:57,766 --> 00:56:00,535
Setting course now to
rendezvous with Skyship 1.

697
00:56:06,099 --> 00:56:07,334
That's right, Scott.

698
00:56:07,366 --> 00:56:09,668
The message was
a recording of my voice.

699
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:12,002
Now, the quicker you arrive,
the better for us.

700
00:56:12,033 --> 00:56:13,401
You've got a fix
on our position.

701
00:56:13,433 --> 00:56:14,400
F.A.B.

702
00:56:14,433 --> 00:56:16,234
OH, l've received a message
from Black Phantom...

703
00:56:16,266 --> 00:56:18,835
to say the Thunderbird
machines were landing.

704
00:56:18,866 --> 00:56:20,500
By now, they must've
taken over the ships...

705
00:56:20,533 --> 00:56:22,668
and shortly,
they'll be on their way...

706
00:56:22,699 --> 00:56:24,334
to rendezvous with us.

707
00:56:24,366 --> 00:56:26,334
Right, the playacting's over.

708
00:56:26,366 --> 00:56:29,168
Round up our International
Rescue guests.

709
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:31,168
They're unsuspecting,
so they won't be armed.

710
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:34,169
Not so unsuspecting,
Captain Foster.

711
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:35,568
Raise your hands,
all of you.

712
00:56:39,033 --> 00:56:40,834
lt sounds as if Alan
needs some help.

713
00:56:40,866 --> 00:56:43,001
Tin Tin, l'll leave you
my compact.

714
00:56:43,033 --> 00:56:44,667
You can keep in touch
with the boys.

715
00:56:44,699 --> 00:56:45,667
F.A.B., Penny.

716
00:56:45,699 --> 00:56:46,700
Come on, Parker.

717
00:57:21,133 --> 00:57:22,734
Quickly, Parker.

718
00:57:23,966 --> 00:57:26,735
Lane, get the other one
as hostage. Quick.

719
00:57:57,633 --> 00:58:00,435
OH, Foster, the numbers
are eVen nOW...

720
00:58:00,466 --> 00:58:02,701
and we can outshoot you,
you know that.

721
00:58:02,733 --> 00:58:05,068
Throw your guns down
and give yourselves up.

722
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,536
l suggest you throw
your guns down.

723
00:58:12,566 --> 00:58:15,435
lf you don't, you can
say good-bye to Tin Tin.

724
00:58:28,233 --> 00:58:30,368
Father, l've lost
contact with Skyship 1.

725
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,201
Right, Scott.
At what position...

726
00:58:32,233 --> 00:58:33,500
do you expect
to rendezvous with it?

727
00:58:33,533 --> 00:58:36,736
According to my calculations,
at approximately 10,OOO feet.

728
00:58:36,766 --> 00:58:38,868
About 5 miles east of Dover.

729
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,034
Well, all you can do, Scott...

730
00:58:40,066 --> 00:58:41,267
is beat the hell
out of those machines...

731
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:43,035
and get there
as soon as you can.

732
00:58:43,066 --> 00:58:44,534
F.A.B.

733
00:58:50,466 --> 00:58:52,434
Very smart, Penelope.

734
00:58:52,466 --> 00:58:54,100
So you radioed
your base?

735
00:58:54,133 --> 00:58:56,201
That's right, Mr. Foster.

736
00:58:56,233 --> 00:58:59,369
You should know that you can't
outwit International Rescue.

737
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,601
l'm not so sure.

738
00:59:00,633 --> 00:59:02,468
The game isn't over yet.

739
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,468
We have you all
as our hostages.

740
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,468
When the Thunderbird
machines arrive...

741
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,068
l've got an idea
they're going to do...

742
00:59:08,099 --> 00:59:09,968
just what we tell them to.

743
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,135
Meanwhile, the gravity
compensating machine...

744
00:59:12,166 --> 00:59:13,634
has come to a standstill.

745
00:59:13,666 --> 00:59:15,134
The jet engines on this bus...

746
00:59:15,166 --> 00:59:17,301
are to give it
forward movement only.

747
00:59:17,333 --> 00:59:18,801
The ship can't
maintain height...

748
00:59:18,833 --> 00:59:20,834
unless the gravity
compensators are working.

749
00:59:20,866 --> 00:59:22,968
l'm well aware
of the situation.

750
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,901
We're losing height
quite slowly.

751
00:59:24,933 --> 00:59:24,933
lt'll be half an hour yet
before there's any real danger.

752
00:59:25,833 --> 00:59:27,634
lt'll be half an hour yet
before there's any real danger.

753
00:59:27,666 --> 00:59:28,867
Martin, go up
on the top deck...

754
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:32,036
and radio down as soon as those
Thunderbirds arrive. Right.

755
00:59:36,366 --> 00:59:38,201
Father, l'm
at rendezvous point.

756
00:59:38,233 --> 00:59:39,968
No sign of Skyship 1.

757
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,634
l don't understand it, Scott.

758
00:59:41,666 --> 00:59:43,300
lt's a big ship.
It'd be hard to miss.

759
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:45,635
Oh, wait. l can see it.

760
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:48,035
lt's about 8,OOO feet
below me.

761
00:59:48,066 --> 00:59:49,033
l don't get it.

762
00:59:49,066 --> 00:59:50,867
According to the New World
pre-programmed schedule...

763
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:53,969
it should be at 10,OOO feet
at this point.

764
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,301
l'm going down
to take a look.

765
00:59:55,333 --> 00:59:56,500
F.A.B.

766
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,102
Foster, Thunderbird 1
directly above us.

767
01:00:12,133 --> 01:00:13,567
OH, Martin.

768
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:15,068
Right. Untie them.

769
01:00:15,099 --> 01:00:16,568
l want you all
up on the top deck...

770
01:00:16,599 --> 01:00:17,867
and no false moves.

771
01:00:24,633 --> 01:00:27,736
OH, father, l'm alongside.

772
01:00:27,766 --> 01:00:29,567
l can see one
of the stewards standing...

773
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:31,401
on the top deck.

774
01:00:31,433 --> 01:00:33,067
Otherwise,
no sign of life.

775
01:00:33,099 --> 01:00:35,635
When Thunderbird 2 arrives,
we'll attempt to board her.

776
01:00:35,666 --> 01:00:37,067
Be with you in about
5 minutes, Scott.

777
01:00:37,099 --> 01:00:38,334
OH, Virgil.

778
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,835
Dad, there's trouble ahead.

779
01:00:57,433 --> 01:00:59,568
Dad, Skyship 1
is losing height.

780
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:00,701
Why? l don't know.

781
01:01:00,733 --> 01:01:03,335
About one mile ahead is
an early warning system...

782
01:01:03,366 --> 01:01:05,000
with interceptor towers.

783
01:01:05,033 --> 01:01:08,002
The estimated height:
1,200 feet.

784
01:01:08,033 --> 01:01:10,335
Below it is a missile site.

785
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:11,700
The way it looks from here...

786
01:01:11,733 --> 01:01:13,835
Skyship 1 is on
a collision course.

787
01:01:13,866 --> 01:01:16,001
The only thing that can
save it is its height.

788
01:01:16,033 --> 01:01:18,034
But l've got my doubts.

789
01:01:23,366 --> 01:01:25,668
lt's a tower head.
We're going to hit it!

790
01:01:25,699 --> 01:01:26,834
How far away is it?

791
01:01:26,866 --> 01:01:28,334
l don't know.
About a quarter of a mile.

792
01:01:28,366 --> 01:01:29,600
l'm coming up.

793
01:01:44,433 --> 01:01:45,834
Dad, there's going
to be a collision.

794
01:01:45,866 --> 01:01:47,167
You'd better alert...

795
01:01:47,199 --> 01:01:49,168
all emergency services
down on the ground.

796
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:51,502
lt's a missile base
about 5 miles east of Dover.

797
01:01:51,533 --> 01:01:52,567
F.A.B.

798
01:02:37,133 --> 01:02:38,601
What's the situation, Scott?

799
01:02:38,633 --> 01:02:41,102
Well, the ship's swaying on
top of one of the towers.

800
01:02:41,133 --> 01:02:42,100
lf that tower gives way...

801
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:43,434
or the ship loses
its balance...

802
01:02:43,466 --> 01:02:43,466
it's going to drop
like a stone...

803
01:02:44,333 --> 01:02:44,766
it's going to drop
like a stone...

804
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,568
right onto that missile
site below.

805
01:02:50,766 --> 01:02:51,933
Come on, quickly.

806
01:02:51,966 --> 01:02:53,200
Up on the top deck and move!

807
01:02:53,233 --> 01:02:55,435
We've crashed, Foster.
Don't you understand?

808
01:02:55,466 --> 01:02:56,500
Throw your gun away.

809
01:02:56,533 --> 01:02:57,600
We're all in this
together now.

810
01:02:57,633 --> 01:02:59,501
l said move!

811
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:05,535
Scott, l've been listening
to your transmission.

812
01:03:05,566 --> 01:03:07,701
l've sighted Skyship.

813
01:03:07,733 --> 01:03:09,201
l'm coming in
straight over the top.

814
01:03:09,233 --> 01:03:11,201
Will lower escape unit.

815
01:03:11,233 --> 01:03:12,701
Brains is already in there.

816
01:03:12,733 --> 01:03:13,767
F.A.B.

817
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,401
ls Brains armed?
He ought to be.

818
01:03:15,433 --> 01:03:16,867
We've no idea what's going on.

819
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,035
lt's OH, Dad.
l've taken care of that.

820
01:03:19,066 --> 01:03:20,100
Good boy.

821
01:03:20,133 --> 01:03:23,202
Attention! Attention!

822
01:03:23,233 --> 01:03:26,703
All personnel
in section ''D''...

823
01:03:26,733 --> 01:03:28,868
to vacate site immediately.

824
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:32,203
Proceed with all
movable equipment...

825
01:03:32,233 --> 01:03:34,868
to rendezvous ''G.''

826
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:36,534
This is an emergency.

827
01:03:36,566 --> 01:03:39,602
Repeat: This is
an emergency.

828
01:03:55,233 --> 01:03:58,703
Virgil, pull off!
Pull off!

829
01:03:58,733 --> 01:04:00,701
Your thrusters are
throwing it off balance.

830
01:04:00,733 --> 01:04:01,867
F.A.B.

831
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:15,134
Base and Thunderbird 2...

832
01:04:15,166 --> 01:04:18,135
we need to decide a course
of action but fast.

833
01:04:18,166 --> 01:04:19,300
As far as l can see...

834
01:04:19,333 --> 01:04:20,634
any attempt
to get near that ship...

835
01:04:20,666 --> 01:04:21,967
is going to bring
a disaster.

836
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,968
The turbulence from
our motors alone...

837
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,468
will be enough
to tip it off balance.

838
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,602
Have you any ideas, Dad?

839
01:04:27,633 --> 01:04:30,369
All personnel and vehicles
to proceed

840
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,170
to rendezvous ''G'' immediately.
This is an emergency.

841
01:04:34,199 --> 01:04:37,336
Repeat: This is
an emergency.

842
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,635
We need a solution,
Gordon, and quick.

843
01:04:40,666 --> 01:04:41,967
As far as l can tell...

844
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,468
the only way we're going
to get them off that tower...

845
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,969
in one piece is to get
a vehicle on that top deck.

846
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,635
Nothing we've got
would be any good, Dad.

847
01:04:48,666 --> 01:04:50,634
Our machines are too heavy.

848
01:04:50,666 --> 01:04:51,800
l know. l know.

849
01:04:51,833 --> 01:04:53,968
We need something light,
Iow air speed...

850
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,969
high maneuverability,
short landing distance.

851
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,469
Say, l've got
the answer, Dad!

852
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:02,202
lt's crazy,
but it could work.

853
01:05:02,233 --> 01:05:03,901
Hey, what's going on?

854
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:05,734
Thunderbird 2 is leaving.

855
01:05:05,766 --> 01:05:07,934
Don't tell me
they've given up.

856
01:05:15,366 --> 01:05:17,067
That's right, Mr. Tracy.

857
01:05:17,099 --> 01:05:18,734
We've got it aboard
Thunderbird 2...

858
01:05:18,766 --> 01:05:20,067
and they just left.

859
01:05:20,099 --> 01:05:22,068
We did all the necessary
checks and fueled it.

860
01:05:22,099 --> 01:05:23,901
l certainly hope it works.

861
01:05:23,933 --> 01:05:27,569
lt's just got to work.
It's just got to.

862
01:05:35,966 --> 01:05:37,567
The top of the tower
is crumbling.

863
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:39,068
l'm going to attach a line...

864
01:05:39,099 --> 01:05:40,901
to the front of the ship to
see if l can hold it steady.

865
01:05:40,933 --> 01:05:42,000
F.A.B.

866
01:05:54,766 --> 01:05:56,300
What the heck are they doing?

867
01:05:56,333 --> 01:05:58,902
Why don't they come in and
get us off this thing?

868
01:05:58,933 --> 01:06:00,734
You saw what happened
when they came in close.

869
01:06:00,766 --> 01:06:02,567
Well, what are they
going to do?

870
01:06:02,599 --> 01:06:04,335
lf you let me call them,
l can find out.

871
01:06:04,366 --> 01:06:05,400
Oh, no, you don't!

872
01:06:05,433 --> 01:06:07,067
l'm not falling into
that little trap.

873
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,235
OH, Dad. Line secured.

874
01:06:37,266 --> 01:06:38,567
l think
it's going to help.

875
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:27,834
Thunderbird 1,
from Thunderbird 2.

876
01:07:27,866 --> 01:07:29,100
One mile from you.

877
01:07:29,133 --> 01:07:32,002
l'm landed on
a grassy stretch down below.

878
01:07:32,033 --> 01:07:33,667
Well done, Virg.

879
01:07:33,699 --> 01:07:35,001
That was a quick trip.

880
01:07:35,033 --> 01:07:36,100
Yeah, well, you see...

881
01:07:36,133 --> 01:07:38,702
l've got a Tiger
in my tank.

882
01:08:06,433 --> 01:08:08,701
OH, Brains, over to you.

883
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,935
Scott and Virgil...

884
01:08:38,966 --> 01:08:40,934
l'm going to circle
the ship...

885
01:08:40,966 --> 01:08:43,101
and then attempt a landing.

886
01:08:43,133 --> 01:08:44,601
OH, Brains.

887
01:08:44,633 --> 01:08:46,668
lf you make it,
the order of evacuation...

888
01:08:46,699 --> 01:08:49,269
will be first, Tin Tin,
second, Penelope...

889
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:52,102
then the crew, and finally,
Parker and Alan.

890
01:08:52,133 --> 01:08:53,501
F.A.B.

891
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:15,367
Right, Scott,
l'm in position.

892
01:09:15,399 --> 01:09:16,868
Brains is on his way up.

893
01:09:16,899 --> 01:09:19,035
l'm going to fix a line
to this end.

894
01:09:19,066 --> 01:09:20,267
OH, Virg.

895
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,035
Still no radio contact
with Skyship 1.

896
01:09:22,066 --> 01:09:24,868
l just don't understand it.
Something must be wrong.

897
01:09:24,899 --> 01:09:26,368
We'll soon find out.

898
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,001
Attaching line.

899
01:09:56,566 --> 01:09:59,969
Don't tell me they're going to
try a rescue with that thing.

900
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,302
They must've got it
from a museum.

901
01:10:02,333 --> 01:10:03,634
You're dead right,
Mr. Foster.

902
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:06,001
But l'll tell you something.
It's a brilliant idea.

903
01:10:06,033 --> 01:10:07,968
l think it's
the only chance we've got.

904
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,136
Lane, Get over on the
other side of the deck.

905
01:10:11,166 --> 01:10:13,468
Get ready to welcome
our guest.

906
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:14,767
Right.

907
01:10:43,633 --> 01:10:44,633
Brains!

908
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,303
Scott, that was a close one.

909
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:02,068
Are you OH, Brains?

910
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:06,070
OH. Climbing
for second attempt.

911
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:07,201
Brains, you're not
going to make it.

912
01:11:07,233 --> 01:11:09,868
As soon as you touch down,
l'll open up with my jets.

913
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:12,068
The slipstream
should slow you down.

914
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,835
Right. Let's try it.

915
01:11:13,866 --> 01:11:15,133
F.A.B.

916
01:11:33,566 --> 01:11:35,534
Penelope and Alan,
in a few moments...

917
01:11:35,566 --> 01:11:37,234
l'm going to open up
my jet engines.

918
01:11:37,266 --> 01:11:38,567
Hold tight to that rail.

919
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:42,103
Alan, raise your hand
if you've understood me.

920
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:47,435
OH, folks, hold tight!

921
01:12:13,733 --> 01:12:15,501
Well done, Brains.

922
01:12:15,533 --> 01:12:18,669
OH. Tin Tin, you're first.

923
01:12:18,699 --> 01:12:20,501
Jump aboard.

924
01:12:20,533 --> 01:12:21,834
Oh, no, you don't.

925
01:12:21,866 --> 01:12:23,901
Get out of that cockpit
and move!

926
01:12:23,933 --> 01:12:27,503
Scott, one of the stewards
has got Brains at gunpoint.

927
01:12:27,533 --> 01:12:30,535
Now we know why there's been
no radio communication.

928
01:12:30,566 --> 01:12:32,167
What're they going
to do, Virg?

929
01:12:32,199 --> 01:12:34,402
Looks as if Penelope
is boarding the aircraft.

930
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:36,902
And the Captain's getting
into the rear cockpit.

931
01:12:43,633 --> 01:12:46,535
OH. Turn this crate around.

932
01:12:46,566 --> 01:12:48,000
What's happened to Brains?

933
01:12:48,033 --> 01:12:50,168
Everyone's moving
towards the Tiger.

934
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:51,334
There's no doubt about it.

935
01:12:51,366 --> 01:12:53,334
The crew is in control
of the situation.

936
01:12:53,366 --> 01:12:54,667
Things look bad, Dad.

937
01:12:54,699 --> 01:12:55,934
Guys, hold it a minute.

938
01:13:02,633 --> 01:13:04,167
Come on! Hurry it up!

939
01:13:20,433 --> 01:13:23,669
Get back fast! This thing's
going to collapse any moment!

940
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:26,869
What makes you think
l'm coming back?

941
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:31,936
Double-crosser!
We've got to stop him!

942
01:13:48,566 --> 01:13:50,501
Quick! Jump aboard!

943
01:13:50,533 --> 01:13:51,867
Come on!

944
01:14:23,366 --> 01:14:26,202
We're going to crash!

945
01:14:26,233 --> 01:14:30,203
We're just overloaded.
That's all.

946
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:22,468
Watch out for trees!

947
01:16:43,533 --> 01:16:46,402
Penelope, throttle back.

948
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:06,567
Thunderbird to base.

949
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:08,902
Father, we're not going to be
able to hold her much longer.

950
01:17:08,933 --> 01:17:10,067
How's the evacuation...

951
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:11,367
of the rocket site
progressing?

952
01:17:11,399 --> 01:17:12,400
Nearly complete...

953
01:17:12,433 --> 01:17:13,901
but they want
about another 5 minutes.

954
01:17:13,933 --> 01:17:16,068
Do everything
you can, Scott...

955
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:18,001
to prevent
that ship falling.

956
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:42,735
Penelope, throttle back.

957
01:17:42,766 --> 01:17:44,067
We're down!

958
01:17:45,566 --> 01:17:47,067
Where's the throttle?

959
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:49,068
Down on the left hand side.

960
01:17:53,966 --> 01:17:55,434
Throttle back.

961
01:18:11,133 --> 01:18:13,034
Penny, throttle back.

962
01:18:15,966 --> 01:18:17,367
Penny, that's the wrong way.

963
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,535
Alan, it's jammed.

964
01:18:23,566 --> 01:18:25,701
l can't move it.

965
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:33,169
Alan, l can't free it.

966
01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:34,601
What shall l do?

967
01:18:34,633 --> 01:18:36,835
Get her nose up! Quickly!

968
01:18:36,866 --> 01:18:38,067
Don't panic.

969
01:18:54,533 --> 01:18:57,435
Alan, there's
another bridge ahead.

970
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:22,604
Pull...up!
Pull the stick back.

971
01:19:26,066 --> 01:19:28,067
Pull it back! Penelope...

972
01:20:06,766 --> 01:20:08,901
Hold the rudder steady,
Penelope.

973
01:20:16,233 --> 01:20:19,569
Alan, obstruction ahead.

974
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:22,500
Alan!

975
01:20:22,533 --> 01:20:25,102
Alan!

976
01:20:26,766 --> 01:20:28,200
This is it!

977
01:20:59,366 --> 01:21:01,634
All personnel and vehicles...

978
01:21:01,666 --> 01:21:05,136
should by now be clear
of sectors ''A'' to ''Q.''

979
01:21:05,166 --> 01:21:06,367
Danger imminent.

980
01:21:06,399 --> 01:21:08,835
l repeat: Danger imminent.

981
01:21:25,933 --> 01:21:27,134
Thunderbird 1?

982
01:21:27,166 --> 01:21:28,967
Loud and clear.

983
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,469
Scott, l just received
the OH from the missile base.

984
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,802
Evacuation
has been completed.

985
01:21:33,833 --> 01:21:35,501
You can let her go.

986
01:21:35,533 --> 01:21:36,967
Right.

987
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,301
Did you hear that, Virgil?

988
01:21:38,333 --> 01:21:39,400
l heard.

989
01:21:39,433 --> 01:21:41,968
OH. Release cables
on 5 second countdown.

990
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
F.A.B.

991
01:21:43,033 --> 01:21:49,372
5...4...3...2...1...

992
01:21:49,399 --> 01:21:50,400
Zero!

993
01:23:18,133 --> 01:23:20,335
l want to get into
the rear cockpit, Penelope.

994
01:23:20,366 --> 01:23:22,901
But first, we've got
to get rid of Foster.

995
01:23:22,933 --> 01:23:22,933
Hold tight, Tin Tin.

996
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:24,967
Hold tight, Tin Tin.

997
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,768
OH, Alan.

998
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:30,570
Hold tight, Brains.

999
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:34,537
OH, Penny, push the stick
over to the left.

1000
01:23:46,466 --> 01:23:49,502
OH. Heep us steady, Penny.

1001
01:23:49,533 --> 01:23:52,936
l'm getting into
the rear cockpit now.

1002
01:24:37,266 --> 01:24:41,770
Alan, l've only just realized
Parker isn't with us.

1003
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:44,102
We must've left him
aboard the airship.

1004
01:24:44,133 --> 01:24:45,767
lt's too late now, Penny.

1005
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:46,934
Anyway, a few
moments from now...

1006
01:24:46,966 --> 01:24:48,834
we may be sharing
the same fate.

1007
01:24:56,633 --> 01:24:58,267
That's our engine gone, Penny.

1008
01:24:58,300 --> 01:24:59,768
Hold tight.

1009
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:02,869
Hold tight, Tin Tin.
l'm putting her down.

1010
01:25:02,899 --> 01:25:04,501
OH, Alan.

1011
01:25:04,533 --> 01:25:08,169
Hold tight, Brains.

1012
01:25:08,199 --> 01:25:10,035
Emergency landing.

1013
01:25:10,066 --> 01:25:11,600
Good luck, Alan.

1014
01:26:11,733 --> 01:26:13,801
Hey, Tin Tin!

1015
01:26:38,399 --> 01:26:43,004
l still say, Alan, that was
a fantastic landing.

1016
01:26:43,033 --> 01:26:44,534
Well, if it hadn't been
for Parker...

1017
01:26:44,566 --> 01:26:46,034
we could've said
we'd got away with it.

1018
01:26:46,066 --> 01:26:48,835
Are you sure there was
no chance of him surviving...

1019
01:26:48,866 --> 01:26:50,367
when Skyship 1 crashed?

1020
01:26:50,399 --> 01:26:52,368
Not a chance, Alan.

1021
01:26:52,399 --> 01:26:54,368
l suppose
it must be shock...

1022
01:26:54,399 --> 01:26:57,369
but a few moments ago,
l'm sure l heard...

1023
01:26:57,399 --> 01:27:00,369
a distant voice
calling, ''Milady.''

1024
01:27:00,399 --> 01:27:03,469
That's funny. l thought
l heard it, too.

1025
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:06,069
Milady!

1026
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:12,170
Milady!

1027
01:27:30,666 --> 01:27:33,635
And now, it gives me
great pleasure...

1028
01:27:33,666 --> 01:27:35,467
to introduce to you all...

1029
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:39,237
my new vehicle--
Thunderbird 6.

1030
01:27:39,266 --> 01:27:42,302
Thunderbird 6?
l don't get it.

1031
01:27:42,333 --> 01:27:44,968
Oh. l know what you're
going to say, Mr. Tracy.

1032
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,801
That you haven't
approved the plans...

1033
01:27:46,833 --> 01:27:49,302
how could it have been
built anyway...

1034
01:27:49,333 --> 01:27:51,635
et cetera, et cetera,
et cetera.

1035
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:54,902
But, nevertheless,
l present to you...

1036
01:27:54,933 --> 01:27:57,468
Thunderbird 6.

1037
01:27:57,500 --> 01:28:01,237
Built, tested, and approved.

1038
01:28:01,266 --> 01:28:05,069
This is
Thunderbird control.

1039
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:08,002
Launch Thunderbird 6.

1040
01:28:17,133 --> 01:28:20,069
Brains! Ha ha.

1041
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:21,067
Well, l'll be a...

1042
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:23,235
Look at that.

1043
01:28:23,266 --> 01:28:28,571
Brains, you old son of a gun.
l'll buy it.

1044
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:32,570
l agree it's a good design.
It has been built...

1045
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:35,703
and it sure has been tested.
