- Oh, I don't know.

145

00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:23,131

- Have a nice night now.

00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,282

00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,166
Somebody at school?

152
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,001
No.

153
00:13:12,418 --> 00:13:14,462
What do you mean you feel bad?

154
00:13:16,522 --> 00:13:20,151
When someone seems sad,
they don't have any friends

155
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:24,930
and people make fun of them,
that makes me feel bad for them.

156
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:28,876
Who is sad and doesn't have any friends?

157
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:32,813
-Sy.
-Sy!

158
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:37,668
- The photo guy at the one hour place?
- Yeah.

159
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:40,905
- Oh Jake.
- I really feel bad for him.

160
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:43,574
But Jake.

161
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:47,853
We don't know that Sy is sad.

162
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:54,643
We really don't know that
much about him you know.

163
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:58,211
<i>I mean he might even have a lot of friends.</i>

164
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:02,384
<i>And he probably has a girlfriend and
a mummy and a daddy who love him.</i>

165
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:08,039
<i>I don't think he does.</i>

166
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:14,563
That is so sweet of you to think of
somebody else like that, you know.

167
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:19,760
Listen Jake.

168
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:24,723
Not everybody is as lucky as we are.

169
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,616
<i>You know?</i>

170
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:30,738
<i>But maybe if we send them good thoughts,</i>

171
00:14:32,248 --> 00:14:35,400
<i>It'll make them feel better.</i>

172
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:40,923
Why don't we close our eyes
and send Sy some good thoughts?

173
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:43,709
- Okay.

00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:13,082
Uncle Sy.

344
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:17,786
Can you help me put this together?

345
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:37,606
<i>How many prints would you like?</i>

346
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,311
Just one set.

347
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:42,662
Maya that's a very beautiful name.

348
00:32:42,687 --> 00:32:44,188
Thank you.

349
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,691
Have you picked up prints here before?

350
00:32:49,716 --> 00:32:52,113
I think maybe once
a long time ago.

351
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:54,182
Your face looks very familiar.

352
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:57,351
You work around here?

353
00:32:57,376 --> 00:32:59,244
Sort of near here.

354
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:03,749
- I've probably seen you at the mall.
- I'm in here pretty often.

355
00:33:05,621 --> 00:33:08,756
We're a little backed
up today is 6:00 okay?

356
00:33:08,781 --> 00:33:11,883
Er I won't be able to pick them
up till tomorrow or the next day.

357
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:14,251
- See you then.
- Thanks honey.

358
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:24,170
COACH: Come on! A little hustle.

359
00:33:24,328 --> 00:33:26,664
Here we go, Right there!

360
00:33:26,742 --> 00:33:27,749
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

361
00:33:27,774 --> 00:33:28,775
Come on.

362
00:33:29,954 --> 00:33:32,340
Good shot, that's the
way to strike the ball.

363
00:33:32,365 --> 00:33:33,442
(WHISTLE BLOWS AGAIN)

364
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,506
Gotta get in front of those son.

365
00:33:36,531 --> 00:33:41,151
Jake I want you to drill alright
visualise where you want the ball to go.

366
00:33:41,207 --> 00:33:42,458
(WHISTLE SOUNDS)

367
00:33:45,358 --> 00:33:46,959
Good one Jake.

368
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:50,630
Jake that's not good enough!
We have to work on that alright.

369
00:33:50,655 --> 00:33:53,824
Alright pay attention
fellas. A little focus.

370
00:33:54,851 --> 00:33:55,948
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

371
00:33:55,959 --> 00:33:58,928
Drill it in there Matt come on!
Good shot, good shot.

372
00:33:59,603 --> 00:34:01,105
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

373
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:07,195
Next practice Thursday. If you
can't make  it be sure to tell Derrick.

374
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:10,425
- Hey Jake.
- Hi.

375
00:34:10,508 --> 00:34:12,051
Toby, you forgot your sweatshirt.

376
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:15,730
I was just on my way home, I saw you
 out there. I thought I'd check it out.

377
00:34:15,755 --> 00:34:18,591
- Jake you alright?
- Yeah.

378
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,977
Is your mum picking you up?

379
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:25,005
Nah! I got my bike.

380
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:30,052
It was a great shot you made.
Your coach was a little rough.

381
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:32,405
He should be more supportive.

382
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:34,139
Want me to have a
word with him for you?

383
00:34:34,164 --> 00:34:35,328
Nah that's okay.

384
00:34:35,923 --> 00:34:37,633
- I will.
- Alright.

385
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:38,970
Okay.

386
00:34:42,832 --> 00:34:46,101
When I was your age I
wasn't very good at sports.

387
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:49,297
- I was kinda chubby kid.
- Hm.

388
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,582
Let's face it I was fat!

389
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:54,810
I was sick all the time.

390
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:58,464
Kept coming down with mono and hepatitis.

391
00:34:58,489 --> 00:35:01,525
Then I broke my collarbone
and I had to wear a weird cast.

392
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:04,436
I kept my arm up like this all winter.

393
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:08,282
I wasn't exactly the most popular kid.

394
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:10,559
How'd you break your collarbone?

395
00:35:10,584 --> 00:35:12,819
I fell out of a tree.

396
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:16,640
- How's your dad doing?
- Good.

397
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:20,503
- Does he come to see the games?
- Yeah sometimes.

398
00:35:20,703 --> 00:35:22,671
Does he come to any games?

399
00:35:22,696 --> 00:35:27,409
He's really busy at work. I
don't know he's busy all the time.

400
00:35:28,419 --> 00:35:30,621
Sounds like an important guy.

401
00:35:30,646 --> 00:35:33,923
I guess! He owns a
company and everything.

402
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:38,905
Probably wants you and your
mum to have nice things you want.

403
00:35:38,944 --> 00:35:42,965
Like that cool bike
and those soccer shoes.

404
00:35:47,482 --> 00:35:49,367
Those things cost money.

405
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:51,450
He'd be here if he could.

406
00:35:51,475 --> 00:35:52,876
I guess.

407
00:35:53,236 --> 00:35:55,412
I got something for you.

408
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:07,842
Wanna guess what it is?

409
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:14,265
Oh!

410
00:36:21,097 --> 00:36:23,966
What's wrong? It's the one you wanted.

411
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:27,684
Mr Parrish I can't take this.

412
00:36:27,746 --> 00:36:29,422
Sure you can Jake.

413
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,563
My parents wouldn't let me.

414
00:36:33,526 --> 00:36:36,270
I'd better be getting back home now.

415
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:40,242
- You sure?
- Yeah thanks anyway Mr Parrish.

416
00:36:42,285 --> 00:36:43,667
See you around the store.

417
00:36:43,692 --> 00:36:44,808
Okay.

418
00:36:47,954 --> 00:36:51,491
- Hey Jake the name's Sy.
- Okay Sy.

419
00:37:35,043 --> 00:37:38,505
Well there's been like some kind of shift.

420
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:41,340
I don't know.

421
00:37:41,427 --> 00:37:43,546
A couple of weeks?

422
00:37:43,955 --> 00:37:45,756
Maybe five weeks.

423
00:37:47,642 --> 00:37:48,743
Six.

424
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:53,247
No I know that, but.

425
00:37:55,341 --> 00:37:56,536
Erm

426
00:37:56,779 --> 00:38:00,850
Yeah but this feels different, you know?

427
00:38:02,946 --> 00:38:07,348
Listen Jan I can't talk right now.
I'll call you back this afternoon.

428
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:11,583
Okay I know. I love you too.

429
00:38:12,097 --> 00:38:13,304
Bye.

430
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:20,766
- Hi Sy.
- Hi there.

431
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:25,621
I was at the Dairy Queen. I saw you
down here and thought I'd say hello.

432
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:30,693
- I'm just grabbing some shopping fuel.
- I never see you away from the store.

433
00:38:31,387 --> 00:38:34,087
After all you'd think we'd run
into each other at some point.

434
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:35,939
Why do you live around here?

435
00:38:35,964 --> 00:38:37,691
I live down-town.

436
00:38:37,776 --> 00:38:38,877
Oh.

437
00:38:39,088 --> 00:38:40,739
Well that's quite a drive.

438
00:38:40,768 --> 00:38:42,790
No I'm used to it.

439
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:50,837
- You have a nice boy there.
- Oh Jake. Yeah.

440
00:38:51,881 --> 00:38:55,427
A little sensitive maybe.
But erm, he likes you Sy.

441
00:38:55,716 --> 00:38:56,764
Oh.

442
00:38:56,789 --> 00:38:59,741
He calls you "Sy the photo guy"

443
00:38:59,766 --> 00:39:02,285
I've watched him grow
since he was this big.

444
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:06,472
That's right. You've been doing
our pictures for a long time.

445
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:10,978
You know I almost feel like Uncle Sy.

446
00:39:12,664 --> 00:39:13,936
(GIGGLES)

447
00:39:14,581 --> 00:39:17,784
Well I've got some
serious shopping to do Sy.

448
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:19,166
Oh sure.

449
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:24,463
Take care.

450
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:31,586
- Oh my God.
- What?

451
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:36,408
It's so weird I... I'm reading
that exact book right now.

452
00:39:37,154 --> 00:39:38,455
You're kidding.

453
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,050
No! I can't believe that
you'd be reading that book.

454
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:46,816
He writes a lot about noticing
coincidence, doesn't he?

455
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:49,196
Yeah, he does.

456
00:39:49,305 --> 00:39:51,839
That thing he says about fear.

457
00:39:56,936 --> 00:40:01,073
"The things we fear the most
have already happened to us"

458
00:40:03,152 --> 00:40:04,395
Wow.

459
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:08,890
I had no idea you were
such a deep thinker Sy.

460
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:12,127
I wouldn't say that.

461
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:19,726
- Do you have any children Sy?
- Me? No, no. I'm not married.

462
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:22,446
- No girlfriend?
- No.

463
00:40:26,284 --> 00:40:29,478
I have a snapshot of my mother though.

464
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:37,264
Hmm.

465
00:40:40,523 --> 00:40:43,667
- She looks very nice.
- She's passed away.

466
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:48,430
Oh... Oh...

467
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:51,766
I'm sorry Sy.

468
00:40:55,465 --> 00:40:57,933
Gosh you know, I have to go.

469
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,450
Erm...

470
00:40:59,475 --> 00:41:03,570
- It was really nice chatting with you.
-It was nice chatting with you.

471
00:41:03,681 --> 00:41:09,076
Um I'll probably see you soon, we can't go
a day without taking a picture something.

472
00:41:09,101 --> 00:41:10,586
Lucky for us.

473
00:41:10,611 --> 00:41:13,980
- Okay bye Sy.
- Bye.

474
00:42:00,922 --> 00:42:03,589
Sy Parrish please see the manager.

475
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,732
<i>Sy to the manager's office
immediately please.</i>

476
00:42:20,194 --> 00:42:21,578
What's with the getup Sy?

477
00:42:21,711 --> 00:42:24,694
It's Wednesday Bill.
I was doing the SRS.

478
00:42:26,171 --> 00:42:29,541
Sy there's been some
discrepancies in the click count.

479
00:42:29,827 --> 00:42:32,856
Oh that's probably Yoshi,
his math skills are weak,

480
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,908
I told you that when you
moved him over from Audio.

481
00:42:35,933 --> 00:42:39,119
All the discrepancies are on
 logs you initialled.

482
00:42:39,167 --> 00:42:40,802
- They are?
- Yeah.

483
00:42:40,827 --> 00:42:45,581
I guess sometimes at the end
of the week, you get a little tired...

484
00:42:45,606 --> 00:42:48,216
We're not talking a few
innocent math errors Sy.

485
00:42:48,241 --> 00:42:51,210
The net-clicks all zero out.
They always zero out.

486
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:56,117
The problem is the shut-down
clicks don't correspond at all.

487
00:42:56,233 --> 00:43:00,378
They don't even come close to matching
the amount of prints that we've sold.

488
00:43:00,551 --> 00:43:03,282
Then it's probably the reorder counter.

489
00:43:03,307 --> 00:43:06,818
- Well I asked Larry about that.
- What did he say?

490
00:43:07,748 --> 00:43:11,401
Well he looked at the counter
and said that it checked out.

491
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:14,193
He also said in 14 years of servicing,

492
00:43:14,218 --> 00:43:16,595
he's never seen a faulty
counter on an Agfa unit.

493
00:43:17,012 --> 00:43:18,213
Really?

494
00:43:18,334 --> 00:43:22,630
So the question is Sy where did all
those unaccounted for prints go?

495
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,720
What's the discrepancy are
we talking about Bill?

496
00:43:25,745 --> 00:43:28,397
We're talking hundreds of prints Sy.

497
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:29,452
Ha!

498
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,486
That's not possible Bill.

499
00:43:31,511 --> 00:43:34,863
Oh I've done the math.
The P.O.'s confirm it too.

500
00:43:34,905 --> 00:43:37,115
I don't know anything about it.

501
00:43:37,143 --> 00:43:39,453
Well I think you do Sy.

502
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:43,463
Well I don't Bill.

503
00:43:44,665 --> 00:43:47,290
Look Sy, I've got a family.

504
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:50,845
I'm not losing my job over this.

505
00:43:55,112 --> 00:43:57,285
I'm letting you go.

506
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:58,352
No!

507
00:44:00,264 --> 00:44:01,365
Oh!

508
00:44:07,766 --> 00:44:11,511
These log discrepancies would be
enough but you're spacing out on...

509
00:44:11,536 --> 00:44:15,347
taking 90 minute lunch breaks,
creating scenes in front of customers.

510
00:44:15,372 --> 00:44:18,446
-Giving away free merchandise.
- What?

511
00:44:18,508 --> 00:44:21,744
Free disposable cameras to
customers on their birthday?

512
00:44:21,769 --> 00:44:24,755
That must have been your bright
idea. Sure as shit isn't company policy.

513
00:44:24,811 --> 00:44:27,272
- You can't do this!
- It's done Sy.

514
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:32,285
I talked to Sims at district.  Now finish
out the week and clear out your locker.
