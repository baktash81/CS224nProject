Where did that come from?

20
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,002
The title department.

21
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,464
Hyah!

22
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,931
That blue should be more blue blue.

23
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,311
Huh?

24
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,188
- That's wrong.
- Ah.

25
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,519
You can't climb those. Start again.

26
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,022
You like these?

27
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,733
No.

28
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,031
How's everything coming along?

29
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,910
The Shogun is coming to visit in one week.

30
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,866
Everyone knows he's trying to decide
who his successor will be.

31
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,328
And if I have anything to do with it,
it'll be me.

32
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:34,958
I've spared no expense

33
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,585
making this the grandest palace
in the land.

34
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,713
Imported mice to chase.

35
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,714
Fine couches to ruin.

36
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,763
And the crown jewel of the palace,

37
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,308
my state-of-the-art bathroom.

38
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,977
Behold, the future!

39
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,813
I call it the Super Bowl.

40
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,231
Because that's what it is, a super bowl.

41
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,649
Impressive.

42
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,444
I hope the Shogun thinks so.

43
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,522
The only thing left to solve
is our little problem.

44
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,698
- Kakamucho?
- Precisely.

45
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,696
What do you do when you're a landlord,

46
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,449
and you have tenants you really hate?

47
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,746
You evict them.

48
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,416
But the town's been there
for thousands of years.

49
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,415
I give you an order,
and you give me facts. Really?

50
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,087
The only fact I'm interested in

51
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:21,133
is that that hairball of a town
is ruining my magnificent view.

52
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:25,213
We've got to wipe them <i>off</i> the map
to make this palace absolutely perfect.

53
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:28,174
But what about the samurai
that's there to protect them?

54
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,932
Just get rid of their samurai!
The fraidy-cats will follow.

55
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:35,105
But make sure
it can't be traced back to me.

56
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,623
Bandits!

57
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,803
You warn the others. I'll get the samurai.

58
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,590
Stranger danger! Stranger danger!

59
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,189
Stranger danger! Stranger danger!

60
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,148
Stranger danger! Stranger danger!

61
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,163
Mr. Samurai! Mr. Samurai!

62
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,043
Bad cats are coming! We need your help!

63
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,831
I've got this. I know exactly what to do.

64
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,080
Samurai, we're coming for you!

65
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,498
Bring it on, bandits!

66
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:18,951
Hyah!

67
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,913
Oh, no!

68
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,761
I know these events look dire,

69
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,264
but we must stand on our own four legs
and fight.

70
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,437
This is our home.

71
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,936
It is the sacred place
where our kittens were born

72
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:27,395
and where we will
one day join our ancestors

73
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,856
in a shoebox buried behind the garage.

74
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,201
Dr. Katz, you have something to say?

75
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,325
No, I just got a hairball.

76
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,828
What we need is a samurai.

77
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,626
We still can't find the last one.

78
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,623
We even put up posters.

79
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:50,380
What we need is a new samurai.

80
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,461
Not it!

81
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,045
No! Think.

82
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,222
Where did we get our old samurai?

83
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,674
Samurais "R" Us?

84
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,386
Argh! No, from the Shogun!

85
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,188
So why don't we ask the Shogun
to send us a new one?

86
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,604
Okay, I've got it.

87
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,904
Why don't we ask the Shogun
to send us a new one?

88
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,455
Work, work, work.
Let's see, what's on the agenda today?

89
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,833
Cat fights on the western front.

90
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,540
Cat-scratch fever
breaking out in the east.

91
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,295
What's this? Our sacred soil

92
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:34,469
has been soiled by a dog
who crossed the border?

93
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:37,048
Probably a Border Collie.

94
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,849
Fortunately, he's been apprehended.

95
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,017
Oh, well.
You break the law, you pay the price.

96
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,311
It's not personal, it's just business.

97
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,604
And you know what they say,

98
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,399
"There's no business
like Shogun business!"

99
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,602
I've got an urgent message!

100
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,904
I've got an urgent message!

101
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,652
From the cats of Kakamucho!

102
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,450
Well, spit it out.

103
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,703
An urgent tweet from Kakamucho?

104
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,155
Hmm.

105
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,084
"Bandits ravaging village, stop.
We need a new samurai, stop.

106
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:09,289
This reign of terror has to stop, stop."

107
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,794
Okay, tell them
I'll send someone right away.

108
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,721
Marmalade! Marmalade!
I need to make a call.

109
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,138
Get me what's-his-name.

110
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,341
I have Ika Chu on line two.

111
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,427
Good, very good, yes.

112
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,478
Pikachu, how's it going?

113
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,306
- Pikachu, how's it going?
- Peek-a-boo, how's it going?

114
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,982
- Peek-a-who...
- Peek-a-you...

115
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,607
- Koo Koo Roo...
- Scooby-Doo...

116
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,658
Toodle-oo...

117
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,697
Pikachu, how's it going?

118
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,625
It's Ika Chu, My Divine Fabulousness.

119
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:50,500
I'm so excited and grateful
that you will honor me with your presence

120
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,627
for the unveiling of my latest creation.

121
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,833
I promise to amaze you.

122
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,592
Listen, I gave you a call
'cause I just got this urgent appeal

123
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,342
from the town of Kakamucho.

124
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,391
Seems they've been set upon by bandits!

125
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:07,062
Can't have ordinary law-abiding cats
terrorized, can we?

126
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,890
Of course we can't, Your Worshipfulness.

127
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,191
Well, I promised them
we'd send a new samurai,

128
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,690
and I'm putting you in charge of it,
Nike Shoe.

129
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,021
Oh, sir,

130
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,574
- I'm so excited and grateful.
- Good, good.

131
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,527
And don't forget, I'll be there next week
to see my new palace.

132
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,204
Looking forward to you
knocking my socks off.

133
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,497
Hey, I'm gonna have to put you on hold.

134
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,790
Here, hold this.

135
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:34,081
No, no, no! This could ruin everything.

136
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,883
"Send a new samurai to Kakamucho."

137
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,711
I just got rid of the last one!

138
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,921
I have to do what the Shogun says

139
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:45,304
but in a way that will benefit me.

140
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,762
Yes, that's it! I need a new plan.

141
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,514
But what can that plan be?

142
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,145
Why am I asking you?

143
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,485
All right, get up.

144
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:00,987
It's time.

145
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,818
Here, this is for you.

146
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,118
What's that for?

147
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,572
Oh, that. That's for your execution.

148
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,657
What? But I haven't done anything.

149
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,786
I don't understand.

150
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:13,337
You came to this country illegally.
It's strictly no dogs allowed.

151
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,913
Didn't you know? Cats hate dogs.

152
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,545
But dogs are lovable.
How could you hate a dog?

153
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,842
My dad hated dogs
and that's good enough for me.

154
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,715
It's not really based on logic.

155
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,467
It just feels right to hate, you know?

156
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,549
Yeah, makes sense to me.

157
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,850
Now severing number one.

158
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,598
Number one?

159
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,729
Number one.

160
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,728
- I don't want to.
- What?

161
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,981
I don't want to do that.
I don't want to go up there.

162
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,608
- Okay, then. You don't have to.
- Really? Thank you.

163
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,067
Of course.
I mean, what are we, barbarians?

164
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,526
Archers!

165
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,696
Hey! I'm trying to think up here!

166
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,828
I know you've got a lot of prisoners
to kill, but please, can you keep it down?

167
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,956
- Sorry!
- Yeah? Thank you.

168
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,504
There he goes.

169
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,304
- Get him!
- Come on, move!

170
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,602
He's getting away!

171
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,099
Hyah!

172
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,976
Hey, can't we just talk this out?

173
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,354
- I don't speak dog.
- But wait.

174
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,401
- We're communicating right now.
- No, we're not.

175
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,479
- You just understood me.
- No, I didn't.

176
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:24,191
You should've never come here, dog!
You don't belong.

177
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,533
- There he is!
- Don't let him get away!

178
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:36,912
Whew!

179
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,628
Doggone it!

180
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,759
Plan, plan...

181
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,975
What I need... Yes!

182
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:54,146
I'll send the worst samurai
in the entire world,

183
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,597
and they do a terrible job.

184
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:58,480
But where do you look
for something truly bad?

185
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,855
Wait, please!

186
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,904
I only came to your country
to learn to be a samurai.

187
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:06,325
As if a dog could ever become a samurai.

188
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,903
Never! A dog.

189
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,908
A dog!

190
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,285
Hold your fire!

191
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,490
Aw!

192
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,411
Nice save.

193
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,496
Always happy to lend a hand.

194
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,625
Hi there. Who's a good dog?

195
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,461
Yeah, who's a good dog? Who's a good dog?

196
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,297
- Does this mean you're not gonna kill me?
- On the contrary!

197
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:31,884
Let's talk about what you can do for me.

198
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:35,892
I am offering to make you
the new samurai of Kakamucho.

199
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,223
- Kakamucho? What's that?
- In the way.

200
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,525
But that's not as important as you are

201
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,898
at this lucky, lucky moment.

202
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,481
Are you sure I'm ready
to defend an entire town?

203
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,862
Maybe I should start out
as a mall samurai.

204
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,989
What?

205
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,615
No, no.

206
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,539
Time to get my new samurai to Kakamucho,

207
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,787
so you can hurry up and die-i-ive...

208
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,290
Dive right in.

209
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,377
Whoa, uh...

210
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:08,049
So, do I get a badge
or a certificate or a...

211
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,221
You know, something official-like?

212
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,149
There you go. Makes it all official.

213
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,192
Wow. A samurai cup.

214
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,816
Yes, they've all got one.
Just show that around.

215
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:29,275
"Wow, he's got a cup. He's a samurai.
We'd better do what he says."

216
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,825
Well, better get going.

217
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:33,028
That town isn't gonna samurai itself.

218
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,906
But I don't know where I'm going!

219
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,209
Don't worry, the horse knows.
He's got GPS.

220
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,083
Giddy-up, uh, Positioning System.

221
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:45,382
Why are you sending the dog
to defend Kakamucho?

222
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:46,833
They will kill him.

223
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:49,545
And the orphanage said
you would never speak.

224
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,425
Yes, they will kill him.

225
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,507
And killing an official samurai...

226
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,308
Why, that's against the law!

227
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,181
I would have to arrest all of them.

228
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,933
And that would leave no one in the town

229
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,265
where I want no one.

230
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,355
You did know where we were going.

231
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,784
It's the latest thing.
It's called a "gun."

232
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,076
Is it dangerous?

233
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,120
Don't be silly, guns don't kill cats.

234
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:18,619
Cars and curiosity kill cats.

235
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:19,699
What's a car?

236
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,580
Careful. You're being curious.

237
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,332
He's coming, he's coming!

238
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,100
There he is! The new samurai!

239
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,530
The new samurai's a dog.

240
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,027
He's a what?

241
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,485
The new samurai is a dog!

242
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,737
The new samurai is a dong?

243
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,162
"Welcome to Kakamucho."

244
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,954
Okay. Here goes nothing.

245
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,639
Welcoming committee?

246
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,057
Maybe this won't be so bad.

247
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,057
Okay, first day on the job.
Make eye contact, smile...

248
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,752
- It's a dog!
- He's gonna ruin everything!

249
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,079
Let's kill him
before the new samurai arrives.

250
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,335
Sic him!

251
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,219
Kill him! Tear him up!

252
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,105
Sit!

253
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,730
Now that's what I call wokking the dog.

254
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,233
Yeah, 'cause she hit that dog with a wok!

255
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,198
Uh, is he dead?

256
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,152
Hey, see if he has any snacks
in his pockets.

257
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,158
Oh, it's a trick! He's playing dead.

258
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:25,538
- Bad doggy!
- Dang it.

259
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,744
- Sic him!
- Wait, can we just talk for one minute?

260
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:28,794
Shut up, dog!

261
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,794
I am the new samurai, I am!
Look, here's my cup.

262
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,417
Let him have it!

263
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,466
Stop! He is the new samurai.

264
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,805
It says he's been appointed
by the Shogun himself.

265
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,013
Well, that is... Wow.
I did not see that coming.

266
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:49,350
Give me that!
You must be confused, little girl.

267
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,810
Argh.

268
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,986
Well, this is certainly disappointing.

269
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,154
What is?

270
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,231
I can't read.

271
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,442
She is right. It's official.

272
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,448
So we cannot kill him?

273
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,325
Yeah, no.

274
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,657
Yeah, I know, I know.
We're all disappointed.

275
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,618
- But we can still hate him, right?
- Absolutely!

276
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,164
You are, number one, not a cat.

277
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,627
Number two, you are a dog,
so that goes back to you not being a cat.

278
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:19,839
And three,
you are definitely not a samurai

279
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,799
because you are a dog, and that
goes back to you not being a cat.

280
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,180
Go back where you came from, car chaser!

281
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,520
Again, what's a car?

282
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,939
Stop being curious. You'll kill us all.

283
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:32,892
Hi.

284
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,644
Hi.

285
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,356
Are you really a dog?

286
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,692
- Yes, I am a dog.
- Told you.

287
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:44,154
I didn't know dogs could be samurai.

288
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,034
Well, they can, and I...

289
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,287
- Wait, why not?
- Your sword's on backwards.

290
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:52,462
No, it's not, actually. Is it?
Do you know how this is supposed to go?

291
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,960
I know a few things about samurai-ing.

292
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:58,169
Fair enough. How about I deputize you
as my official assistant?

293
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,257
Bad dog!

294
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:01,554
Don't talk to him.

295
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,224
Did you touch him?
Time to use our hand sanitizers.

296
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:07,970
No, no, no!

297
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,725
Doggamn it!

298
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,728
What kind of a world do we live in
where good and upright citizens

299
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,901
can't be counted on to kill someone
just because they look different?

300
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,400
We could try beating them up again.

301
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:21,609
Only problem is they still have a samurai.

302
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,239
You're kidding me, right?
He's a Labradork.

303
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,197
Put his tail between his legs
and let's finish this!

304
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,082
Okay. Here goes nothing.

305
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,307
Ooh.

306
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,395
Ooh.

307
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:51,437
Ow!

308
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,599
Wow.

309
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,818
Excellent.

310
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,948
That's right. I'm a samurai now!

311
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,247
Take that! Take that! Oh, yeah!

312
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:10,907
Whoa.

313
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,836
How 'bout a little nip?

314
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,298
A little catnip.

315
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:29,259
- I don't think I'm...
- More for me.

316
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,386
Who are you?

317
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,767
My friends call me Jimbo.

318
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,816
And since I have no friends,

319
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,395
I guess you can call me Jimbo too.

320
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,480
I guess it works either way.

321
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,943
Well, Jimbo, I'm Hank,
and I'm the new samurai.

322
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,529
New samurai, huh?

323
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,869
You know, your sword's on backwards.

324
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,826
Oh, and I suppose you know everything
because you're a samurai.

325
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,285
I know you're not.

326
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,338
- Why, because I'm a dog?
- No, because you're an idiot.

327
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:03,009
No real samurai
would be caught dead wearing that.

328
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,962
Is that a bathrobe?
You get that from a hotel?

329
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,514
You're not a samurai, are you?

330
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,010
I know. Right. I'm not.

331
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,187
I came here to learn to be a samurai,
and then I got this job,

332
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,686
but I don't have the slightest idea
what I'm doing.

333
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:18,858
Is there a book?

334
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,606
You know, an instruction manual,
like <i>How to Be a Samurai?</i>

335
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,937
You mean <i>Samurai for Dummies?</i>

336
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,238
- Yes!
- No.

337
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:25,941
That would be dumb.

338
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,248
Ow! Okay, that hurts.

339
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:36,451
Okay, ow! Oh, that's... Agh!

340
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,052
You'd better get out there.

341
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,054
It's samurai time.

342
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,806
You're the samurai, right?

343
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,730
Uh, it looks a little dangerous out there.

344
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,399
Oh, yeah, dangerous.

345
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:03,149
That's N.W.A. out there.
Ninjas With Attitude.

346
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,025
But you go ahead, it'll be great!

347
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,356
You are the samurai.

348
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,026
Look at that.

349
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,487
- It's that mean old lady.
- Yes, it is.

350
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,039
- Now I have to...
- Yes, you do.

351
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,787
Maybe I could just go talk to them.
You know, work this out.

352
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,084
- You should do that.
- I will.

353
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,627
You go reason with them.

354
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,922
Uh, excuse me?

355
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,597
Excuse me, please.

356
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:33,929
Excuse me!

357
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:39,727
Get lost, dog. This is cat business!

358
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:41,148
Don't listen to him.

359
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,397
You guys are doing a great job.

360
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,277
Sword's still on the wrong side.

361
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,620
My eyes are up here.

362
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:01,794
Ohh!

363
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,872
Right in the eye.

364
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:09,636
Interesting choice,
using your face to block those punches.

365
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:11,592
I wouldn't have considered that.

366
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,172
Yeah, what do you know?

367
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:15,258
Enough not to get my butt kicked.

368
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,263
I got to get some samurai training.

369
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,220
I don't think training can help you.

370
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,272
Couldn't hurt. What am I supposed to do?

371
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,316
If I were you,
I would consider going home.

372
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,768
Maybe being a lapdog.

373
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,649
- I can't leave.
- Sure you can.

374
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,276
I've got nowhere else to go!

375
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,323
It took everything I had to come here.

376
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,028
Then it's, "Hey, get shot full of arrows
or take this job," so here I am.

377
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,284
I've got to make this samurai thing work.
I have to.

378
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,580
But first I need to learn.

379
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,283
Sounds like you need a mentor.

380
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,042
Dog breath?

381
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,667
Not Mentos. Mentor! A teacher.

382
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:49,592
To take you under his wing, teach you
all he knows. That kind of thing.

383
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,419
That's exactly what I need.

384
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:55,427
Perhaps a once-great samurai
who has fallen on hard times

385
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,679
and maybe could use some help himself.

386
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,135
But where could I find one?

387
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,265
Hey! It's you!

388
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,273
What? Get out of here! Who even made that?

389
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:08,728
Don't believe everything you read.

390
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:12,781
This is traditionally the place in a movie
where the hero meets his big opportunity.

391
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,030
You're my guy. Come on, train me.

392
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,327
- But you're a dog.
- Is that what's bothering you?

393
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,372
There's a lot about you
that's bothering me.

394
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,075
Like, for instance, how you got here.

395
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,206
It wasn't easy, that's for sure.

396
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,207
<i>I had to cross impassable seas,</i>

397
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,834
<i>unclimbable mountains</i>

398
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:30,587
<i>and really nasty midtown traffic.</i>

399
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:34,303
But why do you want to be a samurai?

400
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,882
I was always the runt.
Everybody always picked on me.

401
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:42,471
<i>I lived in a bad neighborhood
in a bad part of town full of bad dogs.</i>

402
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:10,256
<i>But this day, something awesome happened.</i>

403
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:13,376
<i>He moved almost faster
than your eye could see.</i>

404
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,429
Huh.

405
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,280
<i>And then he was gone.</i>

406
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,412
<i>A samurai in a strange land
took the time to help...</i>

407
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,327
me.

408
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:51,414
That's why I came here.
To learn to be just like him.

409
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,587
I even kept his sword.

410
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:57,421
I've been wondering where that went.
Thank you!

411
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,393
Wait a minute. That's your sword?

412
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,930
Then that means you're...

413
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,764
I don't want to talk about it.

414
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,064
But will you train me?

415
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,771
- Nope.
- Why?

416
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:15,900
Because you're so busy?

417
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,323
No, because you're so brainless.

418
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,152
I showed you my movie,
the whole flashback thing.

419
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,236
I don't believe it!

420
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:23,571
I'm out of here.

421
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,791
And I never want to see you again.

422
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,509
You. How much did you hear?

423
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,183
Samurai Hank needs your help.

424
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,852
Are you not bound
by your samurai oath to help him?

425
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,476
You mean the one that says
I can't turn my back on those in need?

426
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,307
Yeah, that one.

427
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,607
No.

428
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,193
Well, maybe.

429
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:57,359
That's not what...

430
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,200
Stupid oath!

431
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,029
The cuteness is strong with this one.

432
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,250
- What's this?
- It is a contract

433
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:13,875
between a student, you, and a teacher, me.

434
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,003
Uh, why do we need a contract?

435
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:19,461
Because at this moment
it would be so nice if I weren't here.

436
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:22,343
And if you break this contract,
I won't be.

437
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,343
Besides, it's very straightforward.

438
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:27,347
You swear to be brave, honorable,
protect those in need, not seek glory,

439
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:30,896
finish what you start
and always obey your master.

440
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,475
- The samurai oath!
- Yes.

441
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:37,358
And if you break it,
our contract is broken. And you go home.

442
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,313
Should I have my attorney
look at that first?

443
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,900
We don't have that kind of time.
Now, sign here.

444
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,295
Defend yourself!

445
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,380
What am I supposed to do with a stick?

446
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,509
Lesson one.

447
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:09,970
It is not so important what you do
as it is important that you do something.

448
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,020
A warrior has catlike reflexes.

449
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,144
- I'm not a cat, I'm a dog!
- Nobody's perfect.

450
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,817
Ouch.

451
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,273
Wait. That music.

452
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,074
This is the training montage, isn't it?

453
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:26,323
Can't we just skip ahead
to the part where I'm good?

454
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:30,031
No. This is my favorite part.
The part where you suffer.

455
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,756
Cross the river! Any way you can!

456
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,024
To a cat, nothing is unclimbable!

457
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,648
Did I mention I wasn't a cat?

458
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,400
Just make it
to the other side of the wall.

459
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:03,947
Then you will be ready.

460
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,160
Want to give me a hand?

461
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,370
Very funny!

462
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,201
Don't forget to land on your...

463
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:17,920
...feet.

464
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,644
Nope.

465
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,565
Nope.

466
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,318
Ha.

467
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:43,775
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

468
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,694
Uh-uh. Nope.

469
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:49,527
No?

470
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:11,633
I'm starting to think
you don't know what you're doing.

471
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:13,343
I know exactly what I'm doing.

472
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:14,677
I'm talking about training.

473
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,853
You said you could make me a samurai.

474
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,102
I can make you a pizza.

475
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,980
But I cannot make you into anything.

476
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,152
That power's only within yourself.

477
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:27,106
You said you would help me,
not just whack me with stuff.

478
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,783
I've been whacked my whole life.
That's why I came here.

479
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,326
To learn to be a samurai.

480
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:34,780
Hmm.

481
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,115
You want glory.

482
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,075
You know nothing of being a true samurai.

483
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,752
I'm starting to think you don't either.

484
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:43,672
And you know what? I don't
even believe you are a real samurai. Ha!

485
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,027
So what happened to you?

486
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,696
How did you go from being a samurai

487
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:10,696
to a washed-up loser
who drinks too much catnip,

488
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,743
has an obvious weight problem,

489
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:15,241
no real friends to speak of,
is prediabetic...

490
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:16,538
That's enough!

491
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,826
There was a time I was chief bodyguard

492
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:24,835
of a very important official
named Toshiro Tytune.

493
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:28,543
He was a real cool cat.
With greatness ahead of him.

494
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,253
- Is this a flashback?
- Don't interrupt me.

495
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:33,089
If it's a flashback, you should
project it. It really brings it to life.

496
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:35,595
I don't need the projector.
It's an old-fashioned remembering.

497
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,221
Now stop interrupting.

498
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:42,014
We'd been summoned to a meeting
late one night.

499
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:46,144
<i>It was all very mysterious.</i>

500
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,320
<i>Just didn't feel right.</i>

501
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,891
It's an ambush! Get down!

502
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:35,405
"Happy Birthday"?

503
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,116
<i>I not only ruined</i>

504
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,792
the biggest night of his life,

505
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:46,246
I spayed and neutered his in-laws.

506
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,168
I broke my samurai oath.

507
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,379
I was shamed.

508
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:53,468
That's why I left.

509
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,262
I'll make you a deal.

510
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,683
We'll help each other.

511
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,105
Not helpful.

512
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:37,551
Today we begin something new.

513
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:40,975
I learned
I cannot teach a dog to be a cat.

514
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:45,771
What I must do is teach a dog
to be a better dog.

515
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,848
What's that?

516
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:50,435
The blindfold is to help you focus.

517
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,190
- Ah.
- Now listen.

518
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,441
Tell me what you hear.

519
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,694
I hear you talking and moving.

520
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,525
- Good.
- I hear a bird.

521
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,155
That's it.

522
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:00,611
I smell flowers actually.

523
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,493
Dogs have a keen sense of smell
and excellent hearing.

524
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,698
I hear a dragonfly.

525
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:08,998
I smell wood burning.

526
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:11,080
I smell tea brewing.

527
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:14,792
Hey, are you making nachos?

528
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,423
'Cause someone just cut the cheese.

529
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:19,672
Lesson over.

530
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:21,507
Well done.

531
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:31,267
In battle as in life, a samurai
strives to maintain his balance.

532
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:38,031
And always defeats strength with smart.

533
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:50,752
I can dig it!

534
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:55,715
You must control your fear,
or fear will control you.

535
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,802
It is a dance

536
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:05,099
in which a samurai controls his space

537
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,768
and his body.

538
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,359
What are you learning?

539
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,912
I don't like sticks as much as I used to?

540
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:26,739
What are you learning in here?

541
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:30,622
It's not the size of the dog in the fight,
it's the size of the fight in...

542
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:34,706
No!
It is the size of the dog in the fight.

543
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,507
A big dog has fewer problems.
Let me demonstrate.

544
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:38,584
Hold this.

545
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:42,550
See?

546
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:45,008
That wouldn't happen to a big dog.

547
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,771
We're still behind schedule.

548
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,350
The Shogun will be here in three days!

549
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,401
Oops.

550
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,157
I'm surrounded by imbeciles!
Complete morons!

551
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,912
It must be so hard for you.

552
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,540
The patience and kindness that you show.

553
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:17,464
Ohga, don't take this the wrong way, okay?

554
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,589
But you are a total failure
and a major disappointment.

555
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,966
- No offense.
- None taken.

556
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:25,263
Constructive criticism is always welcome.

557
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,058
Shh. I didn't expect much of you,

558
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,101
and you still disappointed me.

559
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,269
Listen.

560
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:35,520
The cats of Kakamucho are no closer
to leaving than when we started.

561
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:40,275
If you can't get the job done,
perhaps it's time for a real professional.

562
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:42,944
Send in the beast.

563
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:50,489
Now get out.

564
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,176
Hmm.

565
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:28,592
Om.

566
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,592
- Argh!
- Do you mind?

567
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,344
You're harshing my mellow.

568
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,017
Oh. Sorry.

569
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,720
- Teach me something.
- How about patience?

570
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,601
Come on, teach me anything.

571
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:41,399
Seriously, let's do this.
I'm ready for it.

572
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,603
- How about these?
- You're not ready for those.

573
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:45,812
How hard can it be?

574
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:47,773
Hyah! Hwah!

575
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,028
Ah! Uh...

576
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,739
- Ow.
- Samurai Hank!

577
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,820
Sumo is in town!

578
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:56,247
- What's a Sumo?
- He's a giant!

579
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,701
Samurai Hank, you have to do something!

580
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,249
- Right.
- Oh, no!

581
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,797
No, no, no, no, no.

582
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:07,092
No way! You are not ready. Not even close.

583
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,919
- Okay, then we'll go together.
- No, no, no.

584
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:12,847
Not my job. Not my fight.
And you are not prepared.

585
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:14,971
So is someone going to do something?

586
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,802
Yeah, is someone gonna do something?

587
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:19,228
No, someone's not.

588
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,490
You know she's gonna go over there.

589
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:40,201
Not my student.

590
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:41,877
Not my problem.

591
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,009
Sword!

592
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,770
Hi-yah!

593
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,940
Hmm.

594
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:09,021
Hah!

595
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:18,572
Hi-yah!

596
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:23,418
Aah!

597
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:32,878
Hah!

598
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:37,428
What are you doing? I had him!

599
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,634
I know you did,
but this is kind of my job.

600
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:41,845
I could totally take that guy!

601
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,061
You should know
that I am a highly trained...

602
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,816
Mostly trained warrior,

603
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,820
skilled in the ways of karate
and swordplay.

604
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,571
As well as musical theater.

605
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:57,869
In your own best interest,
you should surrender.

606
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,071
You're under arrest!

607
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:07,663
Wait!

608
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,168
Uh, you've got something on your...

609
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,434
Sumo have edamame bean on face.

610
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:23,637
Sumo very allergic.

611
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,143
So, we're all good then?

612
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:28,934
Jimbo?

613
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,861
Is your plan to let him hit you
until he gets tired?

614
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:33,859
- Maybe.
- Bold plan.

615
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,488
Ah, here he comes!

616
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,998
Aah!

617
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:53,546
You wanted to be a samurai. Fun, isn't it?

618
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:54,626
Now go get him!

619
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,757
You can do it, Hank!

620
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,350
Ooh-wah!

621
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,575
He has told you his weakness.

622
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:22,029
Remember, you defeat strength with smart.

623
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:23,659
Now get back out there.

624
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:34,003
Head in the game, Hank!

625
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,533
Huh?

626
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,794
Whoo-hoo!

627
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:14,748
Yeah! That just happened!

628
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,674
I'm a bad dog.

629
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,555
Did you see what I just did there?
It was beautiful.

630
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:23,552
Mm-hmm. And I would say "Congratulations,"

631
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:26,010
but since you're already
doing that yourself,

632
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:27,265
let's get him to a doctor.

633
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:29,392
Oh, yeah, absolutely. Got to do that.

634
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:31,723
I might've really hurt him.
I mean, look at him.

635
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,607
Yah!

636
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:39,314
Hi-yah!

637
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:47,781
Hmm.

638
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:50,750
Did that hurt?

639
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:53,287
Didn't feel a thing.

640
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:57,707
What about that?

641
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:58,917
Nope.

642
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,432
Hey, listen,
sorry I had to do all this to you.

643
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:08,760
Sometimes I'm surprised
by my own strength.

644
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:10,437
There's a new sheriff in town, all right?

645
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:13,106
Better not let me catch you
breaking the law again, you feel me?

646
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:17,144
You're free to go.

647
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:19,730
No one ever beat Sumo before.

648
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:25,114
No one ever nice before.
Now have feelings for Hank.

649
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:30,078
Sumo want to live in Kakamucho with Hank.

650
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:33,786
Well, who doesn't? Safe town
like this one with great law enforcement.

651
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,837
- Ow.
- Psst! It's for you.

652
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:43,219
I wanted to say thank you
for defeating Sumo.

653
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:45,422
- And you are welcome.
- Only one thing.

654
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,678
We can never talk on the street
or anything like that.

655
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:50,681
It just wouldn't look right,
you being a... you know.

656
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,057
Yeah, I got you.

657
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:53,138
Here.

658
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:58,393
Thank you. You're Chuck, right?

659
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,694
- Mmm, no.
- Chuck!

660
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:03,486
- We have to go.
- I have to go.

661
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:09,404
Samurai Hank?

662
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,660
We wanted to give you something.

663
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:12,741
"We"?

664
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:16,791
So your mom wanted to throw me a bone?

665
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,872
No, my mom said to hand it to you.

666
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,001
Why would she do that?

667
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:23,630
Well, if I threw it, it might get
on the ground, all dirty and icky.

668
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,213
No, I meant why would she
want to give me something?

669
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:28,173
To thank you for saving our town.

670
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:31,180
You are the best dog samurai
I have ever seen.

671
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,386
I am the only dog samurai
you have ever seen.

672
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:35,392
But I got to say, you're kind of right.

673
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:38,225
I am mighty impressive
as far as samurais go.

674
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:42,445
Are you all finished?

675
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:45,569
'Cause it's getting late,
and a samurai needs his sleep.

676
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:01,381
Really looks like things
are turning around for me, eh?

677
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,674
You got lucky, kid.
Don't let it go to your head.

678
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,251
Luck? Please.

679
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:07,428
I should be registered as a lethal weapon.

680
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:12,392
Pride goeth before a fall.

681
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:15,353
What do you mean, your ninjas are afraid?

682
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:19,398
Um, since the dog defeated Sumo,
none of my cats want...

683
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:23,103
The Shogun will be here in two days!
I don't care if your ninja are afraid.

684
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:27,156
Take them down to that roadblock
of a town and really just...

685
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:32,612
- You know what I've done?
- Your hair and a catty-pedi?

686
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:34,493
Yes. But no.

687
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:37,746
I've outsmarted my own self
by employing that dog.

688
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,161
Oh, nice.

689
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:43,123
Me likey.

690
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,504
The problem with the good citizens
of Kakamucho

691
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:48,052
is there are too many good citizens
in Kakamucho.

692
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:51,348
It's time to take care of this mutt myself

693
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:53,220
with the ultimate weapon.

694
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:54,472
Me.

695
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:04,770
Sumo,
like butterfly that was once caterpillar,

696
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:06,821
fly like dandelion.

697
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,490
It's a hat. And this one's a boat.

698
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:10,817
That is really good.

699
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:17,953
Oops. That was the hat.

700
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,581
- What did you make?
- A swan.

701
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:23,121
And some other stuff.

702
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:27,800
Oh, wow. That's amazing.

703
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:30,379
You can make anything out of folded paper.

704
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:32,089
All right, make me a sandwich.

705
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:35,847
It's not a sandwich,
but here, I made you something.

706
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:37,677
For good luck.

707
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:39,645
Looks like me.

708
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:42,599
It will always remind you of who you are.

709
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,229
Who you are?

710
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,106
Let's concentrate on who you are not.

711
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:48,063
And that would be a samurai.

712
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:51,115
Come on, Jimbo,
we're just enjoying a beautiful day.

713
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:53,284
The sun is shining, birds are singing.

714
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:56,704
And besides, I deserve a break
for taking care of Sumo.

715
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,077
I mean, just look at him.

716
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:00,158
Butterfly, oh...

717
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,868
That's just the point.

718
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:06,126
You have one little, itsy-bitsy,
tiny weeny bite of success...

719
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:07,924
- I'm sorry, tiny what?
- "Tiny what" what?

720
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:08,966
- What?
- What?

721
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:10,214
Go ahead.

722
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:14,635
The point is,
this is no time for celebrating.

723
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:17,183
It's time to double your efforts
and train even harder.

724
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,259
Now get to it.

725
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:35,952
Hank! My brawling, battling hero.

726
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:38,405
Sorry, I hope I'm not bothering you. Am I?

727
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:40,536
No, I was just getting a workout in.

728
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:41,661
Sure.

729
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:44,665
Very impressive, you defeating Sumo.

730
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:45,745
Oh, wow!

731
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,251
It was nothing.

732
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,378
Oh, I'm sure it was... nothing.

733
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:53,427
Anyway, I came here to invite you
out on the town to celebrate.

734
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:57,473
Tonight, I'm taking you
to the most exclusive club in the country.

735
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,847
Even the members aren't allowed in.

736
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,178
Wow, thank you, but I can't go.

737
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:05,231
I promised my teacher
I'd stay focused on my training.

738
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:08,730
Right. Sounds like your teacher
is someone who's unhappy

739
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:11,358
and wants everyone else to be unhappy too.

740
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:13,690
Do you like fun? You like fun, don't you?

741
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,697
- Of course I like fun! Fun is so fun!
- Fun is fun, isn't it?

742
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,494
The clue is in the word.

743
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:21,448
Drive. Bye! See you later! We'll have fun.

744
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:27,045
It's just one night. It's not a big deal.

745
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:29,964
It is a big deal. It's the only deal.

746
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:33,088
You committed to me to go to the end,
and I did the same for you.

747
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:36,217
You are breaking your word.

748
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:39,345
I am not breaking my word.
We can start training again tomorrow.

749
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:42,052
But tonight I'm gonna have some fun
with my boss.

750
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:43,432
I am your boss.

751
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:47,140
- What?
- I am your boss!

752
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,349
My boss?

753
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:50,731
I tell you what to do, and you do it.

754
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,277
I thought you were my friend.

755
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:55,482
I am your teacher. Your mentor.

756
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:58,739
As I told you when we met,
I am not your friend.

757
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:02,367
A samurai has only duty, not friends.

758
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:04,745
Not my friend. Well, that just sounds sad.

759
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:08,669
Like someone who is unhappy
and wants everyone else to be unhappy too.

760
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:11,498
Well, I don't want to be unhappy.
I'm gonna go have some fun.

761
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:15,753
I hope you succeed in having fun

762
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,178
because you have failed
in everything else.

763
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:21,599
You know a lot about failure, don't you?

764
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:25,223
I defeated the unbeatable Sumo in battle
and saved the town.

765
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:28,272
You can't even get a birthday party right.

766
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:29,599
Don't wait up.

767
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:05,431
Bow and wow. This place is awesome!

768
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:07,182
Where are you going?

769
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:09,560
- Um, end of the line?
- Are you kidding?

770
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:13,018
Hank, don't you get it?
There are no lines for you.

771
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:16,821
You are Samurai Hank,
the hero of Kakamucho!

772
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:20,571
Oh, my gosh! That's Samurai Hank,
the hero of Kakamucho!

773
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:24,195
"VIP." What's that mean?

774
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:26,748
V.I.P. Very Important Pooch.

775
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:29,785
- After you.
- I don't... I don't have any ID.

776
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:32,370
You have something better than ID.

777
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,171
You have celebrity.

778
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:35,248
Wait!

779
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,878
Can I have your autograph, Hank?

780
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:38,334
Um, sure.

781
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:44,845
Now this is what
being a top dog is all about.

782
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,727
Private table, Hank?

783
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:59,484
Dog treat, Hank?
Scratch behind your ears, Hank?

784
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:01,737
Oh, my gosh!
Can we take a picture with you?

785
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,784
- You look hot.
- Who licks your hair?

786
00:52:05,998 --> 00:52:07,659
Thank you, Hank!

787
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:10,082
You're my favorite samurai!

788
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,332
Is it everything I promised?

789
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:16,630
Don't get me wrong,
this is all so fantastic.

790
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:20,176
It's just... You don't think
that I'm being a glory seeker, do you?

791
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:23,675
Hank, never miss an opportunity
to pat yourself on the back.

792
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:34,061
And there's no other place
I would rather you be tonight.

793
00:52:36,028 --> 00:52:38,645
You ready? Let's do this!

794
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:40,150
Hyah!

795
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:35,543
The ninjas are here!

796
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:38,371
Samurai Hank! The ninjas are...

797
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:39,796
right here!

798
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,853
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

799
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,430
Good job. Well done.

800
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:59,142
Autograph, lovely touch there.
Little bonus for you.

801
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:02,069
Thank you. Thank you. Good job. Well done.

802
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:38,810
Jimbo.

803
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:41,101
Yo, Jimbo! Jimbo.

804
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:44,066
You're okay? What happened here?

805
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:46,568
The ninjas showed up again last night.

806
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:50,026
And where were you?
Having fun with your boss.

807
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,613
- What about you?
- I failed my oath for the last time.

808
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:55,952
Where's my sword?

809
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:57,583
Right.

810
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:59,706
They've taken Sumo
to the fortress dungeon.

811
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,708
Now I'm going to get him back.

812
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:04,166
I'll go with you. We're both samurai and...

813
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:08,628
You are not samurai!
You were a selfish idiot.

814
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:11,339
Today, you are nothing.

815
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,640
You just don't want to admit
that I beat Sumo.

816
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:16,765
- You never...
- You really believe that?

817
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:19,893
Edamame was responsible
for your greatest victory.

818
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,223
Edamame? What does that have to do...

819
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,060
I failed to teach,
and you failed to learn.

820
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,940
I've learned a lot from you.

821
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,989
Like when things get tough,
you can hide in the bottom of a bottle.

822
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:34,120
I'm sorry, Jimbo. I... I didn't mean that.

823
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:37,031
You're on the horse backwards.

824
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:40,584
Goodbye, dog.

825
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,043
See ya, cat!

826
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:49,214
Where were you, "great samurai"?

827
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:51,170
Hey, thanks for nothing!

828
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:54,474
'Cause guess what? You did nothing!

829
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,518
And I'm thanking you sarcastically!

830
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,470
Good, I'm out of here.

831
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,348
Gonna get on the first boat
and get home and...

832
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:03,523
That's right. Go.

833
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,109
- Emiko.
- Go back home.

834
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,395
Maybe my mom was right.

835
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,697

What are you doing here?

864
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:55,150
I couldn't help myself. I'm a dog.

865
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,571
That makes me loyal.

866
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:58,023
So I'm here to make things right.

867
00:58:58,118 --> 00:59:00,576
You really think
you can just come back here,

868
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,073
and that makes everything okay?

869
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:05,247
As a matter of fact, I do.
I'm back! You should be happy.

870
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,448
Well, I'm not.

871
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,285
You might as well turn around
and go back where you came from.

872
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:10,460
I'm not going anywhere.

873
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:13,414
Sumo is in there,
and I'm not leaving until we get him out.

874
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,294
We can resolve our differences later.

875
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:18,757
What now?

876
00:59:18,847 --> 00:59:22,590
You defeat strength with smart.
Somebody taught me that.

877
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,925
Um, do you have any ideas?

878
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:29,263
This is smart?

879
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:31,894
Huh?

880
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:40,987
Watch your back!

881
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:44,491
- You do care.
- Only about saving Sumo.

882
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:47,039
You I could do without.

883
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:52,502
Now what?

884
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,546
We have to figure out a way in.

885
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:03,089
- Pretty good idea, huh?
- Stop wagging your tail.

886
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:05,891
I didn't say it was a good idea,
I just said it doesn't suck.

887
01:00:12,818 --> 01:00:13,933
All right, genius, which way?

888
01:00:14,528 --> 01:00:16,235
To the left.

889
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,023
What do you got?

890
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:24,452
Got a D-O-G who's D-O-A.
Want to get him out of sight, P-D-Q.

891
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:26,779
A-S-A-P, huh? Okay.

892
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:35,997
I'm not even a full-time security guard!
I'm just a temp!

893
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:40,422
Let's roll, Fido.

894
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:42,795
Okay.

895
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:46,427
Now, this could be difficult
and might take a while, so let's split up.

896
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:49,727
I'll take the areas to the north and west.
You go south and east.

897
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:51,599
Let's try to be methodical about this.

898
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:55,729
There could be thousands of cells here,
and this could take hours, maybe days.

899
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:56,854
He's right over here.

900
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:59,861
Hey, Sumo, we're here to save you.

901
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:04,195
Guess we should've stolen some keys.

902
01:01:04,286 --> 01:01:05,276
Stand back.

903
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:11,824
Well, at least you tried.

904
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:16,453
Doggy door.

905
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:22,463
Uh, complication
in the "saving him" department.

906
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:24,545
Hank no need to save Sumo.

907
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:27,882
Sumo just prawn in ocean of life.

908
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:30,434
Of course we have to save you.
You're our friend.

909
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,681
Friends?

910
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:35,059
Sumo overcome with emotion.

911
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:38,984
While I appreciate the bro-fest,

912
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,653
we should probably get out of here.

913
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:43,822
Wait a second.
I've got to mark my territory.

914
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:45,240
We don't have time for that.

915
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:48,069
But it's a dog thing.
I want them to know I was here.

916
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:49,449
I even had asparagus last night.

917
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,825
We don't have time!

918
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:52,952
We have to get back to Kakamucho.

919
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:54,659
When we get there, what's the plan?

920
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:56,994
At this moment,
it is not so important what we do

921
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:59,546
as it is important that we do something.

922
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:01,340
Not sure yet what that something is.

923
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:29,781
Remember! Fear is only in your mind.

924
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,737
And a little bit in my kimono.

925
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,352
Jimbo!

926
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,766
- Jimbo, no!
- Both of you get out of here.

927
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,851
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me!

928
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:04,687
You have to get back to Kakamucho.

929
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,271
But we're a team.

930
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:08,778
No, I have to do this.

931
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:11,986
And there is no team in I.

932
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:15,868
But there is an I in samurai.

933
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:22,713
No!

934
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,758
You can't die!
Our issues aren't resolved yet!

935
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:04,587
Heimlich maneuver.

936
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:07,340
Oh!

937
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:09,839
You saved my life! But you touched me.

938
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:11,044
Aw!

939
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:13,801
If that ever happens again,
let me die, okay?

940
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:15,223
Now, what is it?

941
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:17,893
- The prisoner escaped.
- Ah!

942
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:20,186
You let the big cat out of the bag,
didn't you?

943
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:21,763
Of course you did.

944
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,189
Right. Okay.

945
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:26,018
Now, someone is going to pay for this.

946
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:27,523
I'm not saying who,

947
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:30,231
but probably someone very, very stupid.

948
01:04:30,325 --> 01:04:32,862
Do you know what a scapegoat is, Ohga?

949
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:36,866
No, but if there's a goat around here,
I will have him arrested immediately.

950
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:40,369
Oh, brainless. Absolute...
And that goes for all of you.

951
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:42,747
Anyway, never mind.

952
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:45,955
Um, I already have another plan
progressing nicely.

953
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:49,587
A much bigger plan
with even more deadly consequences.

954
01:04:50,512 --> 01:04:52,549
My lord, pardon the intrusion.

955
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:54,971
- What is it?
- It's the Super Bowl.

956
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:56,389
It's overflowing!

957
01:04:56,476 --> 01:04:59,719
Jiggle the handle! Jiggle the handle!

958
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,441
Where's everyone going?

959
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:17,244
Emiko, what's going on?

960
01:05:18,665 --> 01:05:19,655
Emiko?

961
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:22,328
- Emiko!
- Look at this! Have you read this?

962
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:24,911
- No.
- Well, would you read it to me?

963
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:28,372
"Help wanted: Vicious killers
for the destruction of Kakamucho.

964
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:30,958
Prior criminal record a must.
An equal-opportunity employer."

965
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:33,589
Can't you see this is
just the last act of a desperate cat?

966
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,092
We don't care
if it's the first act of <i>Mamma Mia!</i>

967
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:38,719
We're leaving before that army gets here.

968
01:05:57,829 --> 01:06:00,161
Right. How are we doing? Let's see.

969
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:01,409
Cutthroats, good.

970
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:04,412
Bounty hunters, desperados,
biker gangs, excellent.

971
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:08,370
Mugs, thugs, nitwits, dimwits,
mobsters, muggers, bushwhackers.

972
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:10,752
Hornswogglers, serial killers...

973
01:06:10,842 --> 01:06:12,378
Studio executives?

974
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:14,927
Wow, it looks like everyone's here. Great!

975
01:06:15,013 --> 01:06:16,629
What about him?

976
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:20,637
Well, yes, he is scary,
but in the wrong way.

977
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:21,717
Arrest him.

978
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:31,147
Wait, wait! Please, hear me out.

979
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:33,228
You all need to know something.

980
01:06:33,323 --> 01:06:36,111
In an heroic effort to protect your town,

981
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:38,408
today we lost Jimbo.

982
01:06:38,495 --> 01:06:41,487
No, no, not Jimbo!

983
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:43,367
- Who's Jimbo?
- I don't know.

984
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:45,950
- Didn't he date your sister?
- No, that was Gumbo.

985
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:48,331
Why did you even come back?

986
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:49,877
We're leaving, Hank.

987
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:53,002
We're all gonna start new lives
somewhere else.

988
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:54,924
Sure. Go.

989
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:59,338
After all, you're cats.
You've got nine lives, right?

990
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:02,720
But I'm a dog. I have one life.

991
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:06,098
And the best thing that happened to me
in this one life

992
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:08,055
is this town.

993
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:11,267
You had faith in me. You trusted me.

994
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:14,399
And I want to earn that trust back so bad,

995
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:18,699
I'm willing to lay my one life down
for your, uh...

996
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:23,575
Let's see, 247 times 9,
um, and then carry the 5...

997
01:07:23,665 --> 01:07:25,656
2,223.

998
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,912
- 2,000?
- 223.

999
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:30,164
Right. Now what do you say?

1000
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:33,919
Life is short,
and this movie is only 85 minutes long,

1001
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:35,214
not including end credits.

1002
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:36,666
So we have to hurry.

1003
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:38,047
If we're gonna save this town,

1004
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:41,220
we have to find a way
beyond judging each other strictly on

1005
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:44,724
labels like "dog" and "cat."

1006
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:46,722
Together, we can get past all that.

1007
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:49,058
We can all be better

1008
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:51,348
together!

1009
01:07:56,864 --> 01:08:00,402
It's a metaphor,
saying we are all the same.

1010
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:05,158
Look different on the outside,
but we can choose for ourselves

1011
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:07,865
what our insides look like.

1012
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:11,243
See now,
the big guy makes a lot of sense.

1013
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:13,624
Right? So, Sumo, what do we do now?

1014
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:14,955
So what do we do?

1015
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:17,040
Well, step one,

1016
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:19,251
we need to destroy
their lines of communication.

1017
01:08:20,972 --> 01:08:22,804
I've cut the telephone line!

1018
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:24,096
Step two,

1019
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:25,344
someone taught me

1020
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:28,097
that we can make anything
out of folded paper.

1021
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:33,019
Hmm.

1022
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:35,942
How's everyone doing? Feeling evil? Yeah?

1023
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:38,566
Don't be stingy
with the poison on those arrows.

1024
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:40,146
Everyone get plenty to eat?

1025
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:43,529
You can't crush the innocent
on an empty stomach, can you?

1026
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:47,409
Enjoy the entrée
because dessert is death and destruction.

1027
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:54,124
Who knew an evil army
could go through so many beans?

1028
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:56,500
Right. Assemble the troops!

1029
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:31,915
Ah, the smell of victory in the air.

1030
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,162
Go!

1031
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:35,289
Go, my terrible army!

1032
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:39,339
Go to Kakamucho and do your worst!

1033
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:41,757
Oh, and don't forget,

1034
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:45,007
save your receipts!

1035
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:01,102
The signal. They're coming!

1036
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:02,813
They're coming!

1037
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:05,740
It's showtime.
All right, everyone knows what to do.

1038
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:18,412
This is the best bit, isn't it?

1039
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:20,793
Waiting for the death and destruct...

1040
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:22,920
Nah, the best bit
is the death and destruct...

1041
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,546
This is the second best bit.

1042
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:27,049
Kakamucho is going out of business.

1043
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:28,972
Everything must go!

1044
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:33,931
Ah, yes!

1045
01:10:34,021 --> 01:10:35,978
Go, team, go!

1046
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:45,571
They're falling for it!

1047
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:47,820
They're falling for it!

1048
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:49,696
- Ichiro!
- I'm right here.

1049
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:50,777
You're up.

1050
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:58,289
One, you got to account
for elevation and wind. And two...

1051
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:02,088
- got to watch for birds.
- Whoops.

1052
01:11:02,175 --> 01:11:04,166
- Eh, bird got in the way.
- Just try again.

1053
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,217
I only had the one bullet.

1054
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:09,797
What are we gonna do? They'll find out any
minute that we folded them a fake town.

1055
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:13,592
Ah!

1056
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:17,763
Ha.

1057
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:28,531
We've been tricked!

1058
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:40,744
Oh, my.

1059
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:49,677
Time to clean up this town.

1060
01:11:49,764 --> 01:11:51,801
Let's go get 'em!

1061
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:41,429
Hi-yah!

1062
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:44,061
Way to go, Emiko! Whoo-hoo!

1063
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:46,062
Mom, you're embarrassing me.

1064
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:53,529
Sit!

1065
01:13:00,835 --> 01:13:03,623
It's the Shogun!

1066
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:10,333
What was that?

1067
01:13:10,428 --> 01:13:12,010
Now that's a car.

1068
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,554
My Magnificence.

1069
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:18,349
What in the wide, wide world of sports
is going on here?

1070
01:13:18,436 --> 01:13:21,269
That's him! The trouble making dog
that started all this.

1071
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:22,811
Arrest that dog!

1072
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:24,890
- Arrest the dog.
- Yes!

1073
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:30,603
Ouch. Oh, come on.

1074
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:32,484
Ohga, take care of him!

1075
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:33,690
Is he sick?

1076
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:36,776
No, you simpleminded twit! Finish him!

1077
01:13:36,871 --> 01:13:37,861
Hyah!

1078
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:47,587
What the mother father
cooker spaniel's going on here?

1079
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:49,255
Jimbo, you're alive!

1080
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:54,219
- So that's Jimbo!
- See? He did date your sister.

1081
01:13:54,305 --> 01:13:57,969
Okay, okay, that's enough.

1082
01:13:58,059 --> 01:13:59,265
Down, boy!

1083
01:13:59,352 --> 01:14:01,059
Jimbo, is that you?

1084
01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:02,260
Toshi?

1085
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:05,097
You are the Shogun?

1086
01:14:05,191 --> 01:14:06,352
Yeah, sure.

1087
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:08,604
It took years to work my way
up through the ranks,

1088
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:10,605
but look at me now.

1089
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:12,027
What happened to you?

1090
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:16,483
I was shamed, my lord.
I am so, so sorry.

1091
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:18,989
- I ruined your birthday.
- Are you kidding?

1092
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,242
Best birthday party I ever had!

1093
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:23,915
Most surprise parties are so boring.

1094
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:26,993
But that year, that was a real surprise.

1095
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:30,206
I tell that story all the time.
Always brings the house down.

1096
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:32,290
And the stuff with your in-laws?

1097
01:14:32,385 --> 01:14:35,628
My in-laws, oh!
Please, don't get me started.

1098
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:38,133
In-laws you don't pick.
Friends you choose.

1099
01:14:38,224 --> 01:14:41,216
And you, Jimbo, are my friend.

1100
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:42,800
So you forgive me?

1101
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:45,057
Forgiven. Forgotten. No biggie.

1102
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:47,730
Hey, life's short. Like me. Let's move on.

1103
01:14:49,193 --> 01:14:51,104
So, what's up with the dog?

1104
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:54,313
That "dog" was defending Kakamucho.

1105
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:57,570
A dog defending the town? Why?

1106
01:14:57,660 --> 01:15:00,277
Because Lord Ika here
was trying to get rid of it.

1107
01:15:00,371 --> 01:15:03,238
Don't believe him!
I was just trying to get rid of that dog!

1108
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:06,199
You see? Nike Shoe was only
trying to get rid of the dog.

1109
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:08,910
But, sir, that dog
isn't what you think he is.

1110
01:15:09,005 --> 01:15:09,995
He isn't?

1111
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:13,172
I'm not following you.
Can someone else explain this?

1112
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:14,545
AI low me.

1113
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:16,342
Ika Chu wanted to get rid of the dog

1114
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:18,295
because he was getting
in the way of his plan

1115
01:15:18,389 --> 01:15:20,096
to frighten the cats of Kakamucho

1116
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:22,298
so that he could
wipe their town <i>off</i> the map

1117
01:15:22,393 --> 01:15:25,556
in order to make his palace
absolutely perfect.

1118
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:26,977
Wha...?

1119
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:29,601
Did I leave anything out?

1120
01:15:30,317 --> 01:15:31,307
Brains?

1121
01:15:31,402 --> 01:15:35,020
Well, Peek-a-boo,
what do you got to say for yourself?

1122
01:15:35,114 --> 01:15:36,855
You want an explanation?

1123
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:38,531
You're gonna get one.

1124
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:40,654
I am...

1125
01:15:41,412 --> 01:15:43,449
running away!

1126
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:46,122
Looks like we got
a little more samurai-ing to do.

1127
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:20,482
Huh?

1128
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:29,206
Oh.

1129
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:32,206
Ugh.

1130
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:04,487
Oh, you...

1131
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,541
Wait, wait, stop, stop!

1132
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:18,923
Right.

1133
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:22,092
I have something very important
to tell you, Hank.

1134
01:17:22,179 --> 01:17:23,761
What is it?

1135
01:17:23,848 --> 01:17:25,134
I am your father.

1136
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:26,965
- No, you're not.
- No, I'm not.

1137
01:17:31,438 --> 01:17:33,304
I distracted you!

1138
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:37,484
I'm certainly not about
to get outwitted by a stupid dog

1139
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:41,154
who's not even a real samurai.

1140
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:44,528
Oh, but you're wrong. I am a real samurai.

1141
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:47,030
I got a cup right here that says so!

1142
01:17:53,836 --> 01:17:54,871
Grab on!

1143
01:17:56,964 --> 01:17:59,126
No! No, see... Ohga!

1144
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:01,253
You don't understand this concept, do you?

1145
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:04,089
I will save you!

1146
01:18:09,185 --> 01:18:11,472
Oh, my.

1147
01:18:11,562 --> 01:18:14,429
No! Oh, no!

1148
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:16,105
What the flush?

1149
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:18,980
Ohga! Are you feeling what I'm feeling?

1150
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:20,059
I am, sir.

1151
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:24,238
Thar she blows!

1152
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:39,165
This palace is gonna blow.

1153
01:18:39,256 --> 01:18:41,873
And when it does, all this
water is going straight down to. <i>..</i>

1154
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:43,882
Kakamucho!

1155
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:46,131
- What can we do?
- We don't have much time.

1156
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:47,758
We've got to do something.

1157
01:19:03,197 --> 01:19:04,232
One, please.

1158
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:18,118
Guys, you got to help me!
The giant toilet is overflowing!

1159
01:19:18,212 --> 01:19:20,829
Have you tried to jiggle the handle?

1160
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:23,381
Too late for that. But I have an idea.

1161
01:19:27,888 --> 01:19:29,094
We're listening.

1162
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:30,637
But you better make it snappy!

1163
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:31,885
We've had our differences,

1164
01:19:31,976 --> 01:19:33,512
but the times
we've actually worked together

1165
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:34,717
we've accomplished a lot.

1166
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:36,974
So if you trust me,
I think we can save the town.

1167
01:19:37,564 --> 01:19:40,397
- That was pretty snappy.
- What do you want us to do?

1168
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:42,100
Dig!

1169
01:19:42,194 --> 01:19:44,026
But cats don't dig.

1170
01:19:44,113 --> 01:19:46,320
Okay, so you don't dig. Can you swim?

1171
01:20:01,505 --> 01:20:03,166
You heard him. Dig!

1172
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:39,286
Hurry up!

1173
01:20:44,048 --> 01:20:45,288
No!

1174
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:52,295
Where are they?

1175
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:55,218
Help! Help!

1176
01:20:58,645 --> 01:20:59,601
Help!

1177
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,448
Emiko!

1178
01:21:52,783 --> 01:21:53,773
I've got you.

1179
01:22:15,305 --> 01:22:17,717
Well, that pretty much wraps things up.

1180
01:22:17,808 --> 01:22:20,596
Almost 85 minutes exactly.

1181
01:22:20,686 --> 01:22:25,055
All that's left is appointing
a new samurai for Kakamucho.

1182
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:27,481
Well, what do you say, Jimbo?

1183
01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:28,933
Me, my lord?

1184
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:32,395
Hey, why not?
I can't think of anyone better, can you?

1185
01:22:34,116 --> 01:22:38,110
I can. Kakamucho already has a samurai.

1186
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:39,318
The dog?

1187
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:40,653
He can't be a samurai.

1188
01:22:40,747 --> 01:22:42,784
He can't be anywhere. It's the law.

1189
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:44,661
You know the rules: "No dogs allowed."

1190
01:22:44,751 --> 01:22:47,413
It's not personal, it's just business.

1191
01:22:47,504 --> 01:22:49,916
And you know what they say:
There's no business...

1192
01:22:50,007 --> 01:22:52,169
...like Shogun business!

1193
01:22:52,259 --> 01:22:53,841
Exactally!

1194
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:56,259
But he's not a dog.

1195
01:22:57,181 --> 01:22:58,171
He's...

1196
01:22:58,891 --> 01:23:00,177
He's my friend.

1197
01:23:00,267 --> 01:23:04,135
- And more than that, he's our samurai.
- He is?

1198
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:06,391
That's what I was trying to tell you.

1199
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:10,146
Wow. You live nine lives,
you get to see everything.

1200
01:23:10,235 --> 01:23:12,272
Who knew? A dog samurai.

1201
01:23:12,362 --> 01:23:14,569
Hank is not a dog samurai.

1202
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:17,068
Hank is a great samurai!

1203
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:19,651
A truly great samurai!

1204
01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:22,328
Woof, woof, woof, woof!

1205
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:27,500
Then I dub thee Town Samurai of Kakamucho.

1206
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:31,753
Actually,
you already officially appointed him.

1207
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:32,671
I did?

1208
01:23:32,758 --> 01:23:35,170
Yeah, I had an official samurai cup
and everything.

1209
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,627
Oh, well, if you had an official cup
and everything...

1210
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:39,678
And I don't know what that means...

1211
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:42,974
But I bet you don't have
an official sword.

1212
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:50,852
Wait. Please wait.

1213
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:54,772
Thank you. But I can't accept this honor.

1214
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:57,571
- Why not?
- Yeah, why not?

1215
01:23:59,076 --> 01:24:01,238
I have a contract with my teacher

1216
01:24:01,328 --> 01:24:03,285
that says
I haven't yet finished my training.

1217
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:11,669
But there is someone else
that's most deserving of this honor.

1218
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:13,871
Emiko.

1219
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:16,544
You are a true samurai.

1220
01:24:18,804 --> 01:24:21,136
- The little one?
- Yes, my lord.

1221
01:24:21,223 --> 01:24:22,964
She's always defended the town.

1222
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:25,220
I will carry it with honor.

1223
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:26,721
I know you will.

1224
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:43,192
So how does it feel
to be a real samurai?

1225
01:24:43,287 --> 01:24:46,996
Good. But not as good as it will feel
someday when I'm the Shogun.

1226
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:49,244
The Shogun? You?

1227
01:24:51,253 --> 01:24:52,493
You know something?

1228
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:55,080
That ain't such a bad idea. Sure, why not?

1229
01:24:55,173 --> 01:24:58,916
And I got to tell you,
it's good to be the Shogun.

1230
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:11,596
Milk's on me!

1231
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:16,517
Kind of warms your heart, doesn't it?

1232
01:25:18,155 --> 01:25:20,897
- Ow! What's that for?
- Defend yourself!

1233
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:23,524
Wait, wait, stop!

1234
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:25,610
- Time-out. Stop.
- No.

1235
01:25:26,288 --> 01:25:27,403
- That hurts.
- Got you again!

1236
01:25:27,497 --> 01:25:28,987
Ha-ha... Ow!

1237
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:31,073
How does that feel?
This is my favorite part.

1238
01:25:31,168 --> 01:25:32,704
The part where you suffer.
