1
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,636
Hi!

2
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,985
Hey! ALICE: Sorry I'm late.

3
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:41,944
No! ALICE: Rude.

4
00:02:41,987 --> 00:02:43,946
I'm so sorry. No, it's fine.

5
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:45,817
It's fine. WAITER: Ladies.

6
00:02:46,601 --> 00:02:48,080
Hey.Hey.

7
00:02:48,124 --> 00:02:51,475
Um, we'll have a
bottle of the chardonnay

8
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,911
and three glasses, please.

9
00:02:52,955 --> 00:02:54,739
Sure. ALICE: Oh, no. Actually,

10
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:56,023
a vodka soda for me, thank you.

11
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,268
Uh, the waiter's
in love with you.

12
00:03:02,704 --> 00:03:04,488
I mean, I really feel like
he does not know

13
00:03:04,532 --> 00:03:06,621
the definition
of the word "boundaries."

14
00:03:06,664 --> 00:03:09,014
Yeah, because he sent you,
like, 14 dick pics.

15
00:03:09,058 --> 00:03:12,496
Oh, and... he waxes.

16
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,932
Wow. SOPHIE: Yeah.

17
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:18,110
No! Like, the whole...
Really? But why?

18
00:03:18,154 --> 00:03:19,460
I don't know.

19
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:23,377
Oh. Alice's guy
from the swim team?

20
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,137
Okay, we don't have to
talk about Dolphin Dave.

21
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:27,816
I want to have a nice
night, thank you very much.

22
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:29,819
Like, I don't think that
shaving his body hair was

23
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:31,491
gonna make the difference
between Olympic trials

24
00:03:31,515 --> 00:03:32,515
or not.

25
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,605
Oh, God.

26
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:36,694
Sorry.

27
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:39,262
Okay. Thank you.

28
00:03:39,306 --> 00:03:41,221
Oh, thank you!
You're very welcome.

29
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,874
Sophie.

30
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:44,180
The bottle.

31
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:49,098
And vodka soda.

32
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:50,665
Oh.

33
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,797
Yeah, you're welcome.

34
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:54,495
He's obsessed with
you. Sophie, stop.

35
00:03:54,538 --> 00:03:55,950
You don't see it? Don't
tell me you don't see it.

36
00:03:55,974 --> 00:03:57,498
I have a boyfriend.

37
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:58,977
Sophie, leave her alone.

38
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:00,675
Yes, thank you.

39
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:03,504
Sorry, it's just Simon.

40
00:04:03,547 --> 00:04:05,897
Um, actually, he has a
gallery opening on Friday,

41
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:08,335
he wanted me to invite
both of you guys. Oh!

42
00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:09,858
That'd be great.
That... Yeah. Yeah?

43
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:10,902
Yeah?

44
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:12,817
Yeah, definitely.

45
00:04:12,861 --> 00:04:14,254
I just know there's, like...

46
00:04:14,297 --> 00:04:16,604
collectors coming
and so he was saying

47
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:18,258
how much he would
love to introduce you.

48
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:21,870
Well, I'm not really working
in traditional media anymore.

49
00:04:21,913 --> 00:04:23,959
Oh. That's amazing,
that's awesome.

50
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:25,439
It's new, we'll see.

51
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,356
Yeah. Uh... Well, cheers.

52
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:30,879
Cheers.

53
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:32,794
Good to see you. You too.

54
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,993
Okay, so, for my
birthday... Yes.

55
00:04:58,036 --> 00:05:00,952
No. No, no. Your 30th.

56
00:05:00,996 --> 00:05:02,911
We were thinking the
three of us could go

57
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:04,216
to my parents' house up north.

58
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,394
Don't worry, Don and
Sylvie are in Florida,

59
00:05:07,437 --> 00:05:09,570
so they will not be
gate-crashing the party.

60
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:11,659
Okay. You're gonna come, right?

61
00:05:11,702 --> 00:05:14,226
You gotta come, it's gonna
be fun. And I demand it.

62
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,619
I will definitely see.

63
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:18,535
Oh.I should just go soon.

64
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:34,508
Hello?

65
00:06:26,647 --> 00:06:28,257
Oh, my God!

66
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,345
Oh, my God!

67
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,520
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

68
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:32,479
I didn't think
you'd be so jumpy.

69
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:36,918
How was your night?

70
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:41,139
I liked your picture.

71
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,579
Just one, huh?
We were at dinner!

72
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:54,457
Well, we're home now.

73
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:45,290
Oh, you must be
feeling bad this morning.

74
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:50,992
Feeling bad?

75
00:07:51,035 --> 00:07:52,994
I'm feeling good, but I didn't

76
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:54,145
go hard on the
cocktails last night.

77
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:55,736
I did not go...

78
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:57,955
Never just a quiet
night with them two, is it?

79
00:07:57,999 --> 00:07:59,479
No.

80
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:03,700
Do you want a cardamom
bun or a Danish?

81
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:05,963
I thought we were
cutting back on sugar.

82
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:07,312
Well, we are, but, you know,

83
00:08:07,356 --> 00:08:08,636
we're good all through the week,

84
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:09,726
we can treat ourselves
every once in a while,

85
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,838
can't we?

86
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:12,230
Okay, whatever looks good.

87
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:23,067
Excuse me, can I
just get two coffees...

88
00:08:28,464 --> 00:08:29,770
Yeah, it just came up.

89
00:08:30,422 --> 00:08:32,076
Just came up.

90
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,208
Just came up.

91
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,646
Do you remember
that sales thing?

92
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,343
Well, I think it'd
be bad if I missed it.

93
00:08:39,475 --> 00:08:41,042
Oh, so Colleen texted me.

94
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:44,785
Okay. Good to see
you, take care, bye!

95
00:08:44,828 --> 00:08:46,047
Yeah, it just came up.

96
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:48,416
They never remember me in there.

97
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,635
Like, I come in here every week,

98
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:51,139
it wouldn't kill
them to say hello.

99
00:08:51,182 --> 00:08:52,532
They're so weird in there.

100
00:08:54,316 --> 00:08:55,404
Okay, what do you want?

101
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:57,275
Danish looks all right.

102
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:58,719
It looks like fresh
out of the oven.

103
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,629
Oh, so Colleen texted me

104
00:09:02,672 --> 00:09:04,072
this morning about
that sales thing,

105
00:09:04,108 --> 00:09:06,328
Do you remember this
thing I told you about?

106
00:09:06,371 --> 00:09:08,809
Well, anyway, it turns out
now they do need me to go.

107
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:10,375
Why?

108
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:12,203
Just, I came up, I guess.

109
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:15,206
I mean, it's gonna
be boring, you know?

110
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,425
A trip to Minneapolis,

111
00:09:16,468 --> 00:09:18,079
but I think it'd be
bad if I missed it.

112
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:20,908
I guess you just give
me the impression

113
00:09:20,951 --> 00:09:22,631
that you didn't really
care about that job.

114
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,441
I think you can
do better than that.

115
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:38,316
A blank canvas
can be intimidating.

116
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,491
How do you get started?

117
00:09:39,535 --> 00:09:41,624
Uh, experimentation, you know.

118
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:42,906
Well, you know, I
try to be free with it.

119
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,932
I just... I'm boring myself.

120
00:09:44,975 --> 00:09:47,369
I show everything to
Alice at a very early stage.

121
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:50,198
Oh, I'll be right back.

122
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:55,116
Hi! Oh, my God.

123
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,033
Oh, God, I feel like a potato.

124
00:09:59,076 --> 00:10:00,121
You couldn't be a potato.

125
00:10:00,164 --> 00:10:01,252
You look nice, though.

126
00:10:01,296 --> 00:10:02,950
Oh, yeah. Simon got it for me.

127
00:10:02,993 --> 00:10:04,125
It's expensive.

128
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:07,278
Uh, where's Tess, I thought
you were gonna come together?

129
00:10:07,302 --> 00:10:10,958
Um, so, she's... Okay,
she's not coming.

130
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,700
It's just... yeah,
she said she would,

131
00:10:13,743 --> 00:10:14,938
so I put her on the
list, and I... I know.

132
00:10:14,962 --> 00:10:16,287
Please don't be
mad at her. No, I'm...

133
00:10:16,311 --> 00:10:17,854
It's fine, it's fine. You
know what she's like

134
00:10:17,878 --> 00:10:19,357
when it comes to
work stuff. I know.

135
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:22,534
She gets all in her head
and... you know. I'm sorry.

136
00:10:22,578 --> 00:10:24,014
It's fine. Hey!

137
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:25,755
Hi, Sophie. Hi!

138
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,670
Thank you! Oh,
my God, I need this.

139
00:10:27,714 --> 00:10:30,804
You learn pretty quick
that the non-profit world,

140
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:33,545
it attracts nearly as many
narcissists and sociopaths

141
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:36,287
as, like, the corporate
sector does, so...

142
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:38,594
Well, I think that what
you do is amazing.

143
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,876
I do, I do. I think
it's incredible.

144
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,597
It's like a million
times more important

145
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,966
than any of this,
but... Oh, my God.

146
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,034
Thanks for coming anyway.

147
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:45,993
Stop it, this is amazing.

148
00:10:46,036 --> 00:10:47,777
Congratulations. Thank you.

149
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:50,127
Thank you for inviting me.

150
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:51,607
I hope it's a huge success.

151
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,957
I'm so glad you could
make it, it's great to see you.

152
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:01,834
Thank you.

153
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:22,464
Hey!

154
00:11:22,507 --> 00:11:23,595
Mmm.

155
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:27,425
Mini pork bun? Oh, I'm fine.

156
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:28,818
You sure? I'm fine.

157
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:29,926
Alice, Uber's here. I'm sorry we didn't

158
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,275
get to hang out
all night. It's okay.

159
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:32,300
It's a big night for him.

160
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:34,694
So,

161
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:36,062
you are gonna come to the
cottage, right? I promise, I promise.

162
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:37,740
Alice! I'll see you tomorrow,

163
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:38,935
good night.
I love you. Come on.

164
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,700
Let's go! Goodnight. Love you, too.

165
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:49,143
It was a complete
fucking train wreck.

166
00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:50,405
No one even showed up.

167
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:56,039
There were, like,
a hundred people there.

168
00:11:56,063 --> 00:11:57,760
I'm talking about
important people.

169
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:02,306
You still don't
understand this business.

170
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,635
It's cutthroat.

171
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,636
If people aren't
coming to your shows,

172
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,899
it's because you're washed up.

173
00:12:08,118 --> 00:12:09,424
You have to be the best

174
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:11,600
or you're nothing.

175
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:13,863
You are the best.

176
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:18,650
You are to me.

177
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:25,092
Oh, my love. I wish
you could see what I see.

178
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:30,445
My perfectionist.

179
00:12:32,142 --> 00:12:33,491
You're so brilliant.

180
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:36,146
You're amazing.

181
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:39,759
Hey.

182
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,378
Hmm.

183
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:25,848
Hey! Thank you.

184
00:13:56,357 --> 00:14:03,364
♪ You're like a bomb ♪
And I'll never be the same

185
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:10,240
♪ My heart just blown away
♪ In the middle of the day

186
00:14:11,111 --> 00:14:13,504
♪ You're like a bomb

187
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:48,626
Sophie, um, can you pull over?

188
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:50,150
You okay?

189
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,287
Fuck. Sorry, guys.

190
00:14:57,331 --> 00:14:58,593
You okay? Yeah.

191
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:02,075
- Oh, God.
- Oh, no.

192
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:04,207
I shouldn't have looked
at my phone, it's my bad.

193
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:05,905
You're all right.

194
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:12,713
All right. TESS: I
want birthday pancakes

195
00:15:12,737 --> 00:15:13,801
with real syrup. SOPHIE: Okay.

196
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:15,523
Then leave the fake stuff.

197
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:17,307
We got maple syrup right here.

198
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:18,569
All right. SOPHIE: Okay.

199
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:20,093
You want chocolate
chip pancakes?

200
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:21,921
Of course you do. Okay.

201
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:25,185
Two. And s'mores.

202
00:15:25,228 --> 00:15:27,491
Ooh, S'mores! Good idea.

203
00:15:27,535 --> 00:15:28,797
Okay.

204
00:15:34,194 --> 00:15:35,760
I think it's just crazy.

205
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:37,632
You can't let a girl
like that wander around

206
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:39,199
doing whatever she wants.

207
00:15:39,242 --> 00:15:41,853
I mean, of course,
she's gone missing.

208
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:43,855
Parents have no rules anymore.

209
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:45,857
My kids know exactly

210
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:47,226
what kind of hell
there'd be to pay

211
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,383
if I caught them
sneaking around like that.

212
00:15:49,426 --> 00:15:52,081
I mean, why would she
put herself in that situation?

213
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:07,401
Shotgun.

214
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,956
What's a yoga bro?

215
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,307
You know, it's those
super muscular guys

216
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:46,396
that have to grunt their
way into every pose.

217
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,833
It's totally performative.
SOPHIE: Right.

218
00:16:48,877 --> 00:16:50,028
And they have to fight their way

219
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:51,184
to the front of the class

220
00:16:51,227 --> 00:16:53,447
so everybody can
see their balls hanging.

221
00:17:00,193 --> 00:17:01,368
All right.

222
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:06,025
Thank you.

223
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:10,290
Oh, your dad finally
fixed the screen door.

224
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,727
Yeah, he did it
when he opened up.

225
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,555
Got it. SOPHIE: Thank you.

226
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:16,426
Okay.

227
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,341
All right. You
can put that there.

228
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,605
And then through here.

229
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:25,131
Okay, Tess, you're
in my brother's room.

230
00:17:25,174 --> 00:17:27,220
Alice, you're in
my room at the end.

231
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:28,569
Great. SOPHIE: Yeah.

232
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:34,009
Hmm. SOPHIE: Remember these?

233
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,663
I love how your
mom never changes

234
00:17:35,706 --> 00:17:38,448
anything about this place.

235
00:18:18,401 --> 00:18:19,968
All right.

236
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,622
Thank you.

237
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:50,390
You're right.

238
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:52,348
Why... Why... Why have I stopped

239
00:18:52,392 --> 00:18:53,915
having sleep orgasms?

240
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,090
That's normal for you?

241
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,485
In your sleep to... I
like a free orgasm.

242
00:19:00,443 --> 00:19:02,097
Me, too. Oh, my God.

243
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,533
Wouldn't have
to put in any work.

244
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,190
I had a sex dream
the other night.

245
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:09,322
Oh?

246
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:11,280
No. I mean, it was bad.

247
00:19:11,324 --> 00:19:14,892
Oh.It was... It
was with the, um...

248
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:16,981
the waiter from the wine bar.

249
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:18,766
He's hot.Ugh.

250
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:20,507
Like, I shouldn't be having

251
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,074
sex dreams about someone
else when I'm with Simon.

252
00:19:24,685 --> 00:19:26,034
Oof. Who told you that?

253
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,820
No one, that's just how I feel.

254
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,831
Um, I'll clear...

255
00:19:52,016 --> 00:19:53,322
Alice.

256
00:19:56,412 --> 00:19:57,412
Alice.

257
00:19:59,937 --> 00:20:00,938
Alice!

258
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:03,854
Look at me.

259
00:20:05,726 --> 00:20:06,814
You don't want me?

260
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:10,557
I'm just tired. Listen.

261
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,491
If you don't want to fuck
me, you don't want to fuck me.

262
00:20:12,515 --> 00:20:13,908
Alice.

263
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,952
Alice?

264
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:17,650
Will you come join us?

265
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:20,654
Sure.

266
00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:32,753
I don't know, I mean... I don't...

267
00:22:19,076 --> 00:22:21,905
Hey, everyone,
you are listening toHurdle.

268
00:22:21,949 --> 00:22:25,256
I am so, so excited
to bring you today's episode

269
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,825
because I am chatting
with my dear friend...

270
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:30,610
core values, and we're living

271
00:22:30,653 --> 00:22:32,829
and breathing them
every day in our lives.

272
00:22:32,873 --> 00:22:35,397
That's what makes us
feel most fulfilled. Right.

273
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:36,964
So if you can begin
your day like that,

274
00:22:37,007 --> 00:22:38,444
so it's not own your morning,

275
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:41,011
a.k.a., like, do as
much as possible within,

276
00:22:41,055 --> 00:22:42,578
like, a three-hour time span

277
00:22:42,622 --> 00:22:44,580
starting at 4:00 a.m. Correct.

278
00:22:44,624 --> 00:22:45,929
But they're owning your morning

279
00:22:45,973 --> 00:22:47,583
by giving you and yourself,

280
00:22:47,627 --> 00:22:49,667
and your mental health,
and your soul what it needs.

281
00:23:20,355 --> 00:23:21,617
Hi there.

282
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:28,232
Have you seen this
girl? Andrea Evans.

283
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:30,452
No, uh, we just
got here yesterday.

284
00:23:30,496 --> 00:23:32,411
I'm sorry I can't
be more helpful.

285
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:33,977
You keep that,

286
00:23:34,021 --> 00:23:35,912
there's a hotline you can
call if you've seen anything.

287
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,218
Search parties leave at 8:00
every morning from the church,

288
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:39,679
if you could spare the time.

289
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,159
Yeah, okay.

290
00:23:42,203 --> 00:23:44,684
Uh, thank you. Or, good luck.

291
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,555
Take care.

292
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:54,824
Double word score.

293
00:23:54,868 --> 00:23:58,349
Wow. "Door." Wow, well done.

294
00:24:00,351 --> 00:24:02,571
You are making this too easy.

295
00:24:02,615 --> 00:24:04,355
My turn. All right.

296
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:05,400
All right. That was rude.

297
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:08,490
You really did it.

298
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:10,971
Don't be mad.

299
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:14,191
What? No.SOPHIE: Yes!

300
00:24:14,235 --> 00:24:16,019
Hey, Gossip Girl, we
need a second opinion.

301
00:24:17,934 --> 00:24:19,153
Uh, what is it?

302
00:24:19,196 --> 00:24:20,459
"Quakey."

303
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:24,637
Uh, maybe.

304
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,291
We'll take that
as a yes, so that is

305
00:24:27,335 --> 00:24:28,989
twenty-one, double word score.

306
00:24:29,032 --> 00:24:30,730
Wait, why Gossip Girl?

307
00:24:30,773 --> 00:24:32,949
I don't know, the
phone, the hair.

308
00:24:36,997 --> 00:24:40,261
You are aware that
popular culture has evolved

309
00:24:40,304 --> 00:24:42,437
over the last decade. TESS: And?

310
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,832
Maybe your references
are getting a little bit stale.

311
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:47,616
Yeah? TESS: Mm-hmm.

312
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,922
A reboot? With who?

313
00:25:42,453 --> 00:25:43,846
Hey.

314
00:25:52,115 --> 00:25:55,728
Um... so I think I'm
gonna have to leave early.

315
00:25:56,903 --> 00:25:59,470
I know, it's just, work is
really intense right now.

316
00:25:59,514 --> 00:26:02,343
Seriously? We're
here for my birthday.

317
00:26:02,386 --> 00:26:05,041
I... Yeah, I... Sorry, I...

318
00:26:06,477 --> 00:26:08,044
I don't really expect
you to understand.

319
00:26:08,088 --> 00:26:09,611
You're right, I
don't understand.

320
00:26:09,655 --> 00:26:11,023
I was under the impressionthat
we took the week off

321
00:26:11,047 --> 00:26:12,372
so that we could
spend it together.

322
00:26:12,396 --> 00:26:13,876
What are you taking
the week off from?

323
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:19,012
I'm sorry, does
my work not count

324
00:26:19,055 --> 00:26:20,361
because I don't get paid for it?

325
00:26:20,404 --> 00:26:22,406
Of course, your
work counts, Tess.

326
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,060
Your work is amazing.

327
00:26:24,104 --> 00:26:28,238
Sophie, that's not what
we're talking about right now.

328
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:54,047
Hey.Hello.

329
00:26:55,483 --> 00:26:57,006
Guess what I brought?

330
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,660
What?

331
00:26:58,704 --> 00:27:00,531
Fireworks for Tess' birthday.

332
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:02,621
It's a surprise so
don't say anything.

333
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:04,318
Why are you doing
all this for her?

334
00:27:05,754 --> 00:27:07,974
I think you should
cut her some slack.

335
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:13,327
This is a... It's a
milestone of a birthday,

336
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,808
and I think that she
is a little nervous

337
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:19,420
'cause... she thinks that
she should be further along.

338
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:23,685
I think she would expect

339
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:25,295
to be at Simon's
level right now,

340
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:26,601
not that she would admit that.

341
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:30,649
Anyway,

342
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:33,303
I thought we could have a picnic

343
00:27:33,347 --> 00:27:35,262
at that little island
across the lake.

344
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:38,676
Yeah, I don't want to be
in a boat with her right now.

345
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,136
Stop it, it'll be fun.

346
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,921
Sophie, I'm serious.

347
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:45,838
Maybe this is just about
our friendship not being

348
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:47,709
what it used to be.
Whose friendship?

349
00:27:48,797 --> 00:27:50,103
Mine and Tess'.

350
00:27:54,629 --> 00:27:56,326
I don't think you're being fair.

351
00:27:59,112 --> 00:28:04,683
Anyway, we all think our
worst thoughts at night.

352
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:07,642
You will not think this
way in the morning.

353
00:28:21,525 --> 00:28:22,701
Andrea!

354
00:28:25,312 --> 00:28:26,835
Andrea!

355
00:28:30,621 --> 00:28:32,362
Andrea!

356
00:28:32,406 --> 00:28:35,322
I haven't let the girls
leave the house in days.

357
00:28:35,365 --> 00:28:36,889
They're on the verge of mutiny.

358
00:28:38,934 --> 00:28:42,068
If she's hurt, it's probably
someone she knows.

359
00:28:49,423 --> 00:28:50,729
Andrea!

360
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:55,168
Andrea!

361
00:28:55,211 --> 00:28:57,910
Listen, forget
about the history.

362
00:28:57,953 --> 00:28:59,607
We talked about
this over and over.

363
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:02,262
You've told me you can't
be your real self around them.

364
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:04,425
When you've seen them, do
you have a good time or not?

365
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,112
Why do you put
yourself through this?

366
00:29:07,136 --> 00:29:08,747
Do you feel better or worse?

367
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,792
And I think you already
know what you have to do.

368
00:29:10,836 --> 00:29:12,576
And there is a
really easy solution,

369
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,666
you don't need them
in your life anymore.

370
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,320
It's tough, I know it's tough.

371
00:29:17,364 --> 00:29:20,106
Part of growing up is
knowing when to let go.

372
00:29:25,285 --> 00:29:28,375
Hey, you missed
a really fun day.

373
00:29:28,418 --> 00:29:29,985
Hey, where were you?

374
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:31,615
I went out with one
of the search parties.

375
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:33,510
Hmm. Did you find her?

376
00:29:35,034 --> 00:29:36,775
No.

377
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:39,865
So, definitely worth missing
spending the day with us, then.

378
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:41,233
All right, I need some
help at the wood shed,

379
00:29:41,257 --> 00:29:42,563
can you help me out? Mm-hmm.

380
00:29:42,606 --> 00:29:43,782
Thank you.

381
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:49,788
Fuck me!

382
00:29:52,181 --> 00:29:54,357
Okay, lesson number one.

383
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:55,837
This is a maul.

384
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:57,883
I never want to hear
you call it an ax, okay?

385
00:29:59,232 --> 00:30:01,582
So look for the natural
splits in the wood,

386
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:03,236
get your distance.

387
00:30:04,454 --> 00:30:06,195
Feet like so.Okay.

388
00:30:07,283 --> 00:30:09,696
And when you swing, you
want this hand to fall in line

389
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,461
with this hand.
So, like...

390
00:30:13,115 --> 00:30:14,334
Okay.

391
00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:15,683
Got it? Yeah.

392
00:30:18,425 --> 00:30:21,341
Wow. You're good. Well,
that was hardly anything.

393
00:30:21,384 --> 00:30:22,429
Okay.

394
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,520
Nice.

395
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,401
Shit.

396
00:30:39,489 --> 00:30:41,491
Alice? I think
we have enough.

397
00:30:41,535 --> 00:30:42,797
No, it's fine.

398
00:30:51,414 --> 00:30:52,851
Yeah.

399
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:54,026
Thanks.

400
00:31:08,823 --> 00:31:11,521
You just pretend to be
this meek little victim.

401
00:31:11,565 --> 00:31:13,369
You sit there with this
placid look on your face.

402
00:31:13,393 --> 00:31:15,003
I'm here
trying to get through to you,

403
00:31:15,047 --> 00:31:18,441
I'm actually asking you
to do something.

404
00:31:18,485 --> 00:31:20,725
This is exactly what you do.
This is exactly what you do.

405
00:31:21,096 --> 00:31:22,402
I'm tired...

406
00:31:23,011 --> 00:31:24,099
of carrying you.

407

Come on.

420
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:03,633
Come on.

421
00:33:04,504 --> 00:33:06,332
Come on. No, I don't want to.

422
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:11,206
All right.

423
00:33:15,906 --> 00:33:16,995
Okay.

424
00:33:20,563 --> 00:33:21,825
Hey.

425
00:33:23,523 --> 00:33:24,741
I want you.

426
00:33:33,576 --> 00:33:37,624
Whoo! All right!
Come on, Sophie!

427
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:39,278
Tess! TESS:

428
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:41,802
Good morning! SOPHIE: Tess.

429
00:33:41,845 --> 00:33:43,412
And then what
happens to your body,

430
00:33:43,456 --> 00:33:44,761
it goes into starvation mode

431
00:33:44,805 --> 00:33:47,112
and you feel compelled to eat...

432
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:49,114
But, like... like,
a super a lot.

433
00:33:49,157 --> 00:33:50,245
Super a lot, got it.

434
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,923
You're gonna give us diabetes.

435
00:34:15,966 --> 00:34:19,883
I'm making cinnamon rolls,
I can't do it without sugar.

436
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:21,644
You know it's more
addictive than cocaine, right?

437
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:23,496
Yeah, obviously.

438
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:25,280
Cocaine isn't even that good.

439
00:34:28,414 --> 00:34:30,416
You know, I remember a time

440
00:34:30,459 --> 00:34:32,809
when you used to like sugar.

441
00:34:32,853 --> 00:34:34,115
Yeah.

442
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,638
There's just all
this research now

443
00:34:35,682 --> 00:34:37,814
on how it, like, corrodes
your organs and stuff, so.

444
00:34:38,815 --> 00:34:39,816
Hmm.

445
00:34:41,296 --> 00:34:42,296
What?

446
00:34:44,778 --> 00:34:49,870
I... I just know what
disordered eating looks like.

447
00:35:01,795 --> 00:35:03,666
Is this better? Alice,
what are you doing?

448
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:06,234
I mean, if you think I should
have more, I can just keep going.

449
00:35:06,278 --> 00:35:07,975
Stop! Alice, stop!
Is something wrong?

450
00:35:08,018 --> 00:35:09,846
I'm fine! I'm fine! Stop, Alice!

451
00:35:21,641 --> 00:35:22,729
Hey, baby.

452
00:35:24,861 --> 00:35:26,559
Yeah, no, I can hear you.

453
00:35:26,602 --> 00:35:28,126
What's going on?

454
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:30,563
I have no idea.

455
00:35:32,347 --> 00:35:36,090
Your friends, and that
you're actually at a cottage.

456
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,136
So you... you lied to me.

457
00:35:38,832 --> 00:35:39,920
Yeah.

458
00:35:42,662 --> 00:35:43,750
No, I know.

459
00:35:43,793 --> 00:35:46,144
This is just classic bullshit.

460
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:48,189
Like, why would you tell me

461
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:49,601
that you're going on
a road trip when you...

462
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:51,932
I don't know why. I know.

463
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:00,070
Yeah.

464
00:36:01,463 --> 00:36:02,769
Yeah, okay.

465
00:36:03,683 --> 00:36:05,337
Yeah, I love you.

466
00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:09,254
Who was that?

467
00:36:09,297 --> 00:36:12,474
Uh, just Simon. He needs me.

468
00:36:12,518 --> 00:36:14,128
What? Why? You're kidding.

469
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,956
No.What, he can't figure out

470
00:36:15,999 --> 00:36:17,566
how to turn the dishwasher on?

471
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,742
When did he become more
important to you than us?

472
00:36:19,786 --> 00:36:21,091
Jesus Christ, Tess!

473
00:36:21,135 --> 00:36:22,745
Not everything's about you.

474
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:24,443
Me? Are you serious?

475
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,668
I can't believe she's
talking about leaving.

476
00:36:32,712 --> 00:36:34,017
Yeah.

477
00:36:34,061 --> 00:36:35,715
She could have
stayed for my birthday.

478
00:36:35,758 --> 00:36:37,760
It's... frustrating.

479
00:36:37,804 --> 00:36:39,371
We're having a good time, right?

480
00:36:41,373 --> 00:36:42,983
When did she
become such a flake.

481
00:36:45,681 --> 00:36:46,856
I love you, Alice.

482
00:37:37,777 --> 00:37:39,082
Did you take my stuff?

483
00:37:40,693 --> 00:37:42,782
Cinnamon bun? Tess.

484
00:37:43,304 --> 00:37:44,740
What stuff?

485
00:37:44,784 --> 00:37:46,109
My phone and my wallet. I
know you have them, come on.

486
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:47,874
Why would I take your
phone and your wallet?

487
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:50,093
You know why. I
want to hear you say it.

488
00:37:51,356 --> 00:37:53,836
Sophie went to the store and...

489
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,882
hm, you and I need
some alone time.

490
00:37:55,925 --> 00:37:58,145
That's the last thing
that we need, man.

491
00:38:04,151 --> 00:38:05,871
Okay, come on. You
know me better than that.

492
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:12,279
I'll never forgive
you, just so you know.

493
00:38:13,465 --> 00:38:14,596
I'll tell you where they are

494
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,207
if you come out on
the paddle board.

495
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:18,948
Oh, my God.

496
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,489
Should we play a
game? ALICE: Like what?

497
00:38:37,532 --> 00:38:39,447
Stand up. Why?

498
00:38:39,491 --> 00:38:40,840
Come on, it'll be fun.

499
00:38:51,241 --> 00:38:52,895
Come on, fight back.

500
00:38:54,636 --> 00:38:56,246
Come on!

501
00:38:57,465 --> 00:38:58,727
Christ, Tess.

502
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,913
Ugh!

503
00:39:10,957 --> 00:39:12,219
What is wrong with you?

504
00:39:12,262 --> 00:39:13,501
I didn't think
you were gonna fall in.

505
00:39:13,525 --> 00:39:14,917
You were sitting down.

506
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,356
Can you help?

507
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,013
Yeah, it's freezing!

508
00:39:36,678 --> 00:39:37,853
What?

509
00:39:40,247 --> 00:39:41,727
What? My earring!

510
00:39:42,554 --> 00:39:44,294
Fuck! Well, it's gone now.

511
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:45,948
Simon gave me those earrings.

512
00:40:02,138 --> 00:40:03,226
What are you doing?

513
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,359
It's like 30 feet deep here.

514
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,752
You can't see shit down there.

515
00:40:09,537 --> 00:40:10,537
Alice!

516
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,061
Stop it.

517
00:40:14,281 --> 00:40:15,543
Alice!

518
00:40:17,806 --> 00:40:19,025
Alice!

519
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,072
What are you doing?

520
00:40:24,552 --> 00:40:28,251
I can't... I can't... I
can't... Can't what?

521
00:40:28,295 --> 00:40:29,818
I can't do another thing wrong.

522
00:40:29,862 --> 00:40:31,690
Fuck.Alice.

523
00:40:31,733 --> 00:40:33,169
I can't do another thing wrong.

524
00:40:33,213 --> 00:40:35,737
Alice, what does that even mean?

525
00:40:35,781 --> 00:40:38,392
No, I lied to him. He doesn't
even know that I'm here.

526
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,742
What? I mean, he does now.

527
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:42,744
He called.

528
00:40:42,788 --> 00:40:44,442
Well, why did you lie to him?

529
00:40:46,226 --> 00:40:48,446
Because I'm bad.

530
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:49,664
What?

531
00:40:55,627 --> 00:40:57,759
He wouldn't love me if
he knew how bad I am.

532
00:41:01,807 --> 00:41:03,765
Jesus, is that something
that he tells you?

533
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,295
You're such a fucking
cunt sometimes.

534
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,473
Alice?

535
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,649
Alice?

536
00:41:20,739 --> 00:41:22,915
Alice, is it? No! Just... no.

537
00:41:35,405 --> 00:41:36,537
Hey.

538
00:41:38,713 --> 00:41:40,759
Why do you let him
pull this shit with you?

539
00:41:40,802 --> 00:41:43,849
He's not... He's
not pulling anything.

540
00:41:43,892 --> 00:41:45,720
I lied to him, he has
every right to be angry.

541
00:41:45,764 --> 00:41:47,287
You lied? About what?

542
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:50,203
Just... about being here.

543
00:41:50,246 --> 00:41:53,598
Alice, you can't tell your
supposed life partner

544
00:41:53,641 --> 00:41:55,184
that you're going to go on
a trip with your best friends

545
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:57,297
and somehow that's your fault.

546
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,841
I can't think of a bigger red
flag than that. ALICE: It's not...

547
00:41:59,865 --> 00:42:02,824
Hey, can we just approach
this without judgment?

548
00:42:02,868 --> 00:42:04,323
Are you seriously
telling me that you have

549
00:42:04,347 --> 00:42:05,697
no opinions about this?

550
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,873
Of course I do, but
Alice is a grown woman.

551
00:42:07,916 --> 00:42:09,459
Yes! And I don't
know how any of this is

552
00:42:09,483 --> 00:42:10,876
your business.
When you're friends

553
00:42:10,919 --> 00:42:12,114
with somebody, it means you care

554
00:42:12,138 --> 00:42:13,269
about the other person.

555
00:42:13,313 --> 00:42:15,054
But I guess that's a concept

556
00:42:15,097 --> 00:42:16,708
Simon managed to
erase from your brain

557
00:42:16,751 --> 00:42:18,642
along with the rest of your
personality. Tess, stop it.

558
00:42:18,666 --> 00:42:21,495
Maybe this is my
personality and I'm changing,

559
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,212
and you're the shitty
friend for not, like,

560
00:42:23,236 --> 00:42:25,238
letting me change.
We're not all content

561
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:27,675
to, like, flip between projects.

562
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:29,459
Some of us have
real adult lives.

563
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,853
Fucking a 40-year-old
does not make you an adult.

564
00:42:31,897 --> 00:42:33,028
He's 37.

565
00:42:33,072 --> 00:42:34,813
Yeah, he's a fucking clown.

566
00:42:34,856 --> 00:42:37,032
And he's got this
stupid, smarmy accent

567
00:42:37,076 --> 00:42:38,468
and his art is...

568
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,429
self-indulgent,
derivative garbage.

569
00:42:42,472 --> 00:42:45,171
You're just jealous because
he's successful and you're...

570
00:42:51,307 --> 00:42:52,526
I'm what?

571
00:42:53,745 --> 00:42:56,095
Simon loves me. I'm happy.

572
00:42:58,532 --> 00:42:59,838
Is this what you think love is?

573
00:42:59,881 --> 00:43:01,448
What would you know?
You've never been

574
00:43:01,491 --> 00:43:03,319
in a serious relationship.

575
00:43:03,363 --> 00:43:06,148
Romantic love isn't
the only kind of love.

576
00:43:06,192 --> 00:43:07,889
Only boring people think that.

577
00:43:07,933 --> 00:43:10,457
Okay, cool. I guess
I'm boring then.

578
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,869
Well, I mean, if the
shoe fits. I didn't say it.

579
00:43:11,893 --> 00:43:13,173
God, I can't stand
you right now!

580
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:14,319
I can't stand you right now!

581
00:43:46,275 --> 00:43:52,412
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

582
00:44:10,778 --> 00:44:12,345
Alice?

583
00:44:12,388 --> 00:44:14,548
Please, please go away.
Please go away. Please go away.

584
00:44:15,087 --> 00:44:16,218
Please go.

585
00:44:17,698 --> 00:44:19,439
Please go.

586
00:44:19,482 --> 00:44:21,571
Alice? Please go away, please!

587
00:45:32,251 --> 00:45:33,731
Andrea!

588
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,257
Andrea!

589
00:46:46,499 --> 00:46:47,805
Hello?

590
00:46:58,119 --> 00:46:59,338
Andrea?

591
00:49:22,176 --> 00:49:24,309
I'm assuming you don't
care that I was worried.

592
00:49:33,318 --> 00:49:34,406
Can I come in?

593
00:49:36,147 --> 00:49:37,322
I guess.

594
00:49:53,816 --> 00:49:55,601
I made you a sandwich
in case you're hungry

595
00:49:55,644 --> 00:49:56,994
but don't want to admit it.

596
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:02,869
Thank you.

597
00:50:15,229 --> 00:50:17,014
Sophie's gone looking for you.

598
00:50:17,057 --> 00:50:18,537
I think she's pissed at us.

599
00:50:24,412 --> 00:50:25,892
I'm sorry that I made you worry.

600
00:50:28,764 --> 00:50:29,896
You good?

601
00:50:35,336 --> 00:50:36,729
I don't want to go home.

602
00:50:41,255 --> 00:50:42,387
Then we'll stay.

603
00:51:21,861 --> 00:51:23,123
Sophie back yet?

604
00:51:24,168 --> 00:51:25,168
No.

605
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:29,086
This ax is a piece of shit.

606
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:31,523
That's actually a maul.

607
00:51:31,566 --> 00:51:32,654
Ugh, great.

608
00:51:34,352 --> 00:51:35,440
Thank you for that.

609
00:51:38,312 --> 00:51:39,618
"She felt very young,

610
00:51:39,661 --> 00:51:42,229
"and at the same time
unspeakably aged.

611
00:51:42,273 --> 00:51:44,971
"She sliced like a knife
through everything.

612
00:51:45,014 --> 00:51:48,453
"She had a perpetual sense
of being out, out,

613
00:51:48,496 --> 00:51:50,368
"far out to sea and alone.

614
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:53,153
"She always had
the feeling that it was

615
00:51:53,197 --> 00:51:56,330
"very, very dangerous
to live even one day."

616
00:51:58,245 --> 00:52:00,465
I like you reading me to sleep.

617
00:52:20,789 --> 00:52:22,487
You were gone a while.

618
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:23,966
I needed some space.

619
00:52:24,489 --> 00:52:28,188
You know, this trip isn't
just about you, Tess.

620
00:52:28,232 --> 00:52:29,711
You make me sound like a bully.

621
00:52:30,103 --> 00:52:31,191
Well...

622
00:52:36,631 --> 00:52:37,632
I'm not a bully!

623
00:52:39,765 --> 00:52:41,636
Oh, my God, stop!

624
00:52:42,855 --> 00:52:45,901
Wow. Now that is cleared
up, who would like a donut?

625
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,384
Hot Chocolate?

626
00:52:50,428 --> 00:52:51,603
Yes, please.Yeah.

627
00:52:58,218 --> 00:53:00,655
How did Simon
know you were here?

628
00:53:00,699 --> 00:53:02,614
He looked at my email.

629
00:53:02,657 --> 00:53:04,181
He never would have let me come.

630
00:53:04,224 --> 00:53:06,139
What?

631
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,359
Yeah, he checks
things sometimes.

632
00:53:08,402 --> 00:53:09,925
Alice.

633
00:53:09,969 --> 00:53:12,101
I know.

634
00:53:12,145 --> 00:53:14,800
He always has a reason.

635
00:53:14,843 --> 00:53:16,715
I take my phone into
the bathroom with me

636
00:53:16,758 --> 00:53:17,846
now when I shower.

637
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:19,152
Andrea!

638
00:53:22,329 --> 00:53:24,113
Andrea!

639
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:32,861
Andrea!

640
00:54:12,814 --> 00:54:15,014
I know this sounds crazy,
but sometimes it feels like...

641
00:54:16,557 --> 00:54:18,255
like he can read my mind,

642
00:54:18,864 --> 00:54:22,128
and, like... if he
can do that, then...

643
00:54:24,304 --> 00:54:26,915
there's nowhere left that
I can actually be alone.

644
00:54:29,875 --> 00:54:31,920
I never know what's
going to make him angry,

645
00:54:31,964 --> 00:54:34,575
so I spend all this time

646
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:37,056
trying to be good, trying to
think of ways to be better.

647
00:54:37,099 --> 00:54:39,754
Like if I could just
purify my thoughts.

648
00:54:44,672 --> 00:54:45,934
But you can't. I mean...

649
00:54:48,546 --> 00:54:49,721
it's never good enough.

650
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,941
I... I don't know.

651
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,859
But he doesn't hurt me
or anything, you know?

652
00:54:57,903 --> 00:54:59,731
He doesn't hurt you?

653
00:55:03,735 --> 00:55:05,911
I really wish you would
have told us this sooner.

654
00:55:07,956 --> 00:55:09,218
I didn't know what to say.

655

♪ Happy birthday to you

656
00:55:29,064 --> 00:55:30,631

Wow!

658
00:55:31,893 --> 00:55:33,852
Oh, you're a wise old lady now.

659
00:55:33,895 --> 00:55:35,984
Uh, I have always
been a wise old lady.

660
00:55:36,594 --> 00:55:37,769
In spirit, at least.

661
00:55:37,812 --> 00:55:40,554
Now you are in body, too.Mm-hmm.

662
00:55:40,598 --> 00:55:42,687
I'm just gonna go for it.

663
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:44,819
Uh, I'm sorry, but I don't think

664
00:55:44,863 --> 00:55:46,691
this is enough chocolate chips.

665
00:55:46,734 --> 00:55:49,171
Whoa. Excuse me?

666
00:55:49,215 --> 00:55:50,845
Is this how you treat
people on their birthday?

667
00:55:50,869 --> 00:55:53,654
That's a good
chip-to-pancake ratio.

668
00:55:53,698 --> 00:55:55,264
Oh, my God.

669
00:55:58,311 --> 00:55:59,573
We should go out tonight.

670
00:55:59,617 --> 00:56:01,445
Is there even
anything around here?

671
00:56:01,488 --> 00:56:03,403
Maybe the place
near the food mart.

672
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:06,145
I just don't know if it's open
this early in the season.

673
00:56:07,233 --> 00:56:08,626
I could check if I had my phone.

674
00:56:14,849 --> 00:56:15,981
Do you want it back?

675
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,506
No.

676
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:20,768
Not yet.

677
00:56:25,556 --> 00:56:27,276
What will he do if he
doesn't hear from you?

678
00:56:30,517 --> 00:56:31,605
I'm not sure.

679
00:56:38,264 --> 00:56:39,613
I could text him

680
00:56:39,657 --> 00:56:41,528
and tell him that
you got hit by a bus.

681
00:56:43,791 --> 00:56:45,663
Oh, my God, Tess.

00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:19,827

No, I... I feel like I got one.

688
00:58:50,048 --> 00:58:51,310
Don't say that!

689
00:58:51,353 --> 00:58:53,834
No, in sympathy. In sympathy.

690
00:58:53,878 --> 00:58:55,227
I don't really have one,

691
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:57,403
but I just need to pee
all the fucking time.

692
00:58:57,446 --> 00:58:59,884
Needing to pee and having
a UTI is not the same thing.

693
00:58:59,927 --> 00:59:02,843
Yeah, it is! It's like
Cystitis and, like...

Cystitis? ALICE:
Oh, she's smart.

♪ Or anywhere with you

717
01:00:19,703 --> 01:00:21,748
♪ You said that I was naive

718
01:00:21,792 --> 01:00:25,099
♪ And I thought
that I was strong

719
01:00:25,143 --> 01:00:27,232
♪ I thought, "Hey,
I can leave, I can leave."

720
01:00:37,459 --> 01:00:40,375
Hmm. Simon thinks
chips are disgusting.

721
01:00:40,419 --> 01:00:42,551
Nobody actually
thinks that. ALICE: He does.

722
01:00:43,248 --> 01:00:44,641
"Alice, that's enough...

723
01:00:44,684 --> 01:00:47,339
"that's enough
saturated fats to...

724
01:00:47,382 --> 01:00:50,168
"Alice, that's enough
saturated fat to kill a horse.

725
01:00:51,865 --> 01:00:55,477
"Alice. Alice...

726
01:00:55,521 --> 01:00:59,090
"You'll regret that when you
get on the scale in the morning.

727
01:00:59,133 --> 01:01:01,333
"You are going to get fat if
you keep eating like that."

728
01:01:25,725 --> 01:01:27,335
What, do I just light it?

729
01:01:27,379 --> 01:01:28,510
This was your idea.

730
01:01:28,554 --> 01:01:29,966
That doesn't mean
I know how to do it.

731
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:31,775
Just, I don't know,
light the string thing.

732
01:01:31,818 --> 01:01:33,037
This thing? ALICE: Yeah.

733
01:01:34,386 --> 01:01:36,431
Gosh.

734
01:01:38,738 --> 01:01:40,174
Oh, my God.

735
01:02:34,925 --> 01:02:37,405
I feel like garbage.

736
01:02:37,449 --> 01:02:40,234
You asked the waitress
for birthday shots.

737
01:02:40,278 --> 01:02:42,454
Remember that drink
you used to make us?

738
01:02:42,497 --> 01:02:45,718
Which one? Gin and Smirnoff Ice.

739
01:02:46,371 --> 01:02:48,199
Ugh.

740
01:02:52,899 --> 01:02:54,945
Oh, that must be egg guy.

741
01:02:54,988 --> 01:02:56,207
Egg guy?

742
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:58,165
Oh, you should come.
He's guaranteed to have,

743
01:02:58,209 --> 01:03:00,385
like, a duck
or a kitten with him.

744
01:03:01,081 --> 01:03:02,561
I like cats.

745
01:03:06,695 --> 01:03:08,654
Oh.

746
01:03:20,753 --> 01:03:21,972
There's my girl.

747
01:03:29,109 --> 01:03:30,284
Missed you.

748
01:03:32,243 --> 01:03:33,853
I didn't know you were coming.

749
01:03:33,897 --> 01:03:35,724
I've been calling and calling.

750
01:03:35,768 --> 01:03:38,205
Well, the service
is pretty bad up here.

751
01:03:38,249 --> 01:03:39,859
Your Instagram feed
says otherwise.

752
01:03:42,906 --> 01:03:45,038
Well, I'm sure Alice will
explain it all to me later.

753
01:03:52,306 --> 01:03:54,308
Jesus fucking Christ.

754
01:03:56,528 --> 01:03:58,269
Alice, will you stop fussing?

755
01:03:58,312 --> 01:03:59,531
I can...

756
01:04:02,447 --> 01:04:03,752
It's...
It's fine.

757
01:04:07,234 --> 01:04:08,670
I guess I got too much, eh.

758
01:04:09,802 --> 01:04:11,586
I hope no one was
desperate for olives.

759
01:04:34,522 --> 01:04:37,351
This is kind
of a girls trip, Simon.

760
01:04:37,395 --> 01:04:39,832
We weren't expecting you.

761
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:43,749
What, are we telling
ghost stories?

762
01:04:43,792 --> 01:04:46,360
Alice was missing me,
so I thought I'd swing by.

763
01:04:49,581 --> 01:04:50,582
Tess.

764
01:04:52,671 --> 01:04:54,281
And Sophie.Thanks.

765
01:04:58,807 --> 01:05:00,244
Your favorite, my love.

766
01:05:00,287 --> 01:05:01,419
Thank you.

767
01:05:09,993 --> 01:05:11,187
Jeez, are you sure
you're not trying

768
01:05:11,211 --> 01:05:13,170
to give us mad cow
disease, Simon?

769
01:05:15,389 --> 01:05:16,714
Would you like me
to put yours back on,

770
01:05:16,738 --> 01:05:18,001
Tess? It's fine.

771
01:05:18,044 --> 01:05:19,484
It's really not a
problem. It's fine.

772
01:05:25,312 --> 01:05:26,312
Sorry.

773
01:05:27,619 --> 01:05:28,968
Well, cheers.

774
01:05:34,713 --> 01:05:35,801
Cheers.

775
01:05:55,516 --> 01:05:57,127
I was pretty worried about you

776
01:05:57,170 --> 01:05:58,563
when I didn't hear
back from you.

777
01:06:00,478 --> 01:06:02,438
You know, I heard about
the girl who went missing.

778
01:06:03,263 --> 01:06:04,656
Yeah.

779
01:06:04,699 --> 01:06:06,373
They didn't find the
guy who killed her yet.

780
01:06:06,397 --> 01:06:08,355
Why would you just
assume that she's dead?

781
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,749
I'm not assuming.

782
01:06:19,714 --> 01:06:21,890
The checkout clerk couldn't
stop going on about it.

783
01:06:47,438 --> 01:06:51,485
Um, I found... this
thing out of that cottage.

784
01:06:56,577 --> 01:06:57,752
It's just weird.

785
01:07:00,625 --> 01:07:02,888
It might be hers, it
might mean something.

786
01:07:02,931 --> 01:07:03,976
What, this?

787
01:07:05,804 --> 01:07:07,414
Alice, darling, I...

788
01:07:07,458 --> 01:07:09,498
I really don't think anyone's
gonna care about this.

789
01:07:14,813 --> 01:07:16,032
No, probably not.

790
01:07:20,732 --> 01:07:21,733
You look different.

791
01:07:26,912 --> 01:07:29,306
She looks like herself.Mm-hmm.

792
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:30,429
No, it's the hair, I think.

793
01:07:35,399 --> 01:07:36,661
Yeah, it's very...

794
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:39,098
bohemian.

795
01:07:45,104 --> 01:07:46,366
My beautiful girl.

796
01:08:20,357 --> 01:08:21,401
Hmm.

797
01:08:23,142 --> 01:08:25,623
You didn't tell me you were
living in the lap of luxury.

798
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:33,150
But then there's lots of
things you didn't tell me.

799
01:08:34,458 --> 01:08:37,939
I mean, how are we
supposed to be happy together

800
01:08:37,983 --> 01:08:39,376
if we can't trust each other?

801
01:08:42,814 --> 01:08:45,121
Are you sorry for what you did?

802
01:08:47,949 --> 01:08:51,214
It's completely destabilizing

803
01:08:51,257 --> 01:08:52,737
when you do shit like this.

804
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:54,304
It derails my work.

805
01:08:54,347 --> 01:08:55,870
I know, I'm sorry.

806
01:08:55,914 --> 01:08:58,699
I just... I... I'm
trying to work out

807
01:08:58,743 --> 01:09:00,701
why you would choose

808
01:09:00,745 --> 01:09:02,355
to hurt me so
deliberately. I just... No.

809
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:05,010
I... I mean, I just wanted

810
01:09:05,053 --> 01:09:06,490
to hang out with
my friends.Right.

811
01:09:06,533 --> 01:09:07,597
I wasn't... So you
wanted to be here

812
01:09:07,621 --> 01:09:09,057
with them at my expense.

813
01:09:10,755 --> 01:09:12,235
You're incredibly selfish.

814
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,771
Come here.

815
01:09:31,515 --> 01:09:32,690
Come on.

816
01:09:42,961 --> 01:09:44,681
I haven't even got to
properly kiss you yet.

817
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:55,060
Just let me brush my teeth.

818
01:11:41,732 --> 01:11:42,907
Should...

819
01:14:25,548 --> 01:14:26,828
Actually I need
to get up as soon

820
01:14:26,853 --> 01:14:29,160
as possible in the morning
so we can get out of here.

821
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:33,164
I can't wait to get home.

822
01:15:07,764 --> 01:15:08,808
You're leaving?

823
01:15:08,852 --> 01:15:10,680
Uh, I have to. Yeah.

824
01:15:10,723 --> 01:15:11,811
You know that.

825
01:15:36,227 --> 01:15:37,533
Be home soon.

826
01:15:39,143 --> 01:15:40,231
Ah...

827
01:15:47,847 --> 01:15:49,608
God, they take themselves
so fucking seriously,

828
01:15:49,632 --> 01:15:50,894
don't they?

829
01:15:50,937 --> 01:15:52,199
Look at this guy.

830
01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:55,289
Come on, man.

831
01:15:55,333 --> 01:15:57,161
Maybe I should get out and push.

832
01:16:02,427 --> 01:16:03,559
Sophie!

833
01:16:05,735 --> 01:16:06,779
What the fuck.

834
01:16:08,389 --> 01:16:09,509
What the fuck are you doing?

835
01:16:12,132 --> 01:16:13,873
Look what you've
done to my fucking car!

836
01:16:16,223 --> 01:16:19,705
What... What the...
What is wrong with you?

837
01:16:24,841 --> 01:16:25,842
Alice.

838
01:16:27,234 --> 01:16:28,434
Alice, come on.
Get in the car.

839
01:16:31,369 --> 01:16:32,631
Alice.

840
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:34,981
Alice.

841
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:36,592
No.

842
01:16:43,686 --> 01:16:44,904
Jesus Christ.

843
01:16:47,428 --> 01:16:48,647
Come on. Mm.

844
01:16:49,561 --> 01:16:50,649
We should get going.

845
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:54,740
Let's just... Come on,
put the fucking ax down.

846
01:16:54,784 --> 01:16:56,568
It's a fucking maul, Simon.

847
01:16:58,091 --> 01:17:00,790
Can you put the maul down?

848
01:17:02,879 --> 01:17:03,923
Alice?

849
01:17:05,316 --> 01:17:06,839
I know you're very emotional.

850
01:17:07,884 --> 01:17:11,104
In fact, I came out here
because I was worried.

851
01:17:11,583 --> 01:17:12,802
She said no.

852
01:17:20,026 --> 01:17:21,027
Alice?

853
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:23,813
Just... Hey.

854
01:17:24,988 --> 01:17:25,989
Hey.

855
01:17:27,904 --> 01:17:32,256
Alice, let's just, uh...
just take a breath.

856
01:17:32,299 --> 01:17:33,518
Just get in the car.

857
01:17:33,910 --> 01:17:35,041
Come home.

858
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:40,351
You've always said they
don't really know you.

859
01:17:40,394 --> 01:17:41,657
You're so full of shit.

860
01:17:45,399 --> 01:17:46,400
Alice.

861
01:17:47,967 --> 01:17:49,229
It's just...

862
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:52,929
It's you and me,
come on. It's just us.

863
01:17:54,234 --> 01:17:55,671
Let's go home.

864
01:17:55,714 --> 01:17:57,585
We can work through this.

865
01:17:57,629 --> 01:18:00,763
I'm trying to prove I'm
someone who really loves you.

866
01:18:02,547 --> 01:18:04,568
Let's just forget about
all of this, it doesn't matter.

867
01:18:04,592 --> 01:18:06,072
She said no.

868
01:18:06,116 --> 01:18:08,553
Why don't you shut
your fucking mouth?

869
01:18:08,596 --> 01:18:10,947
And stay the fuck out of this!

870
01:18:12,078 --> 01:18:13,210
Back off!

871
01:18:33,926 --> 01:18:34,927
It's okay.

872
01:19:15,446 --> 01:19:16,752
Fuck this.

873
01:19:24,629 --> 01:19:25,891
I give it a week.

874
01:19:54,398 --> 01:19:57,096
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

875
01:20:27,387 --> 01:20:29,259
Sometimes I get a...

876
01:20:29,302 --> 01:20:31,565
a word or a saying
stuck in my head.

877
01:20:32,088 --> 01:20:33,263
Like a...

878
01:20:35,004 --> 01:20:37,093
phrase that keeps surfacing,

879
01:20:37,136 --> 01:20:39,245
and it will just repeat itself
again and again and again

880
01:20:39,269 --> 01:20:40,618
until it's all I can hear.

881
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:46,842
And for a while, it was
this voice asking me...

882
01:20:49,018 --> 01:20:51,368
"What are the chances?

883
01:20:51,411 --> 01:20:53,239
"What are the chances?
What are the chances?"

884
01:20:54,762 --> 01:20:56,242
What are the chances of what?

885
01:20:58,418 --> 01:21:00,116
Um, I don't know. Maybe...

886
01:21:04,816 --> 01:21:07,210
what are the chances I don't
come out on the other side?

887
01:21:08,951 --> 01:21:10,391
What are the chances
I don't want to?

888
01:21:17,785 --> 01:21:19,962
And lately, it's, um...

889
01:21:23,269 --> 01:21:25,881
someone asking me, "Where
will you put your shame?

890
01:21:25,924 --> 01:21:27,186
"Where will you
put your shame?"

891
01:21:27,230 --> 01:21:28,753
And it's my voice, but it isn't.

892
01:21:33,801 --> 01:21:35,194
You can give it to us.

893
01:21:37,022 --> 01:21:38,241
Here.

894
01:22:05,094 --> 01:22:06,356
Did it work?
