1
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,658
Tell him being a maid
is not part of the job.

2
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,162
Why don't you tell him, sir?

3
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,792
Now that I have your attention,
it's my opinion this lovely lady

4
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,877
has better things to do
than be your servant.

5
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,382
Do I hear a second on the motion?

6
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,677
Hi, dick.

7
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,934
I found it. Hi, frank.

8
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,761
The old man's coming.

9
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,823
Gentlemen... and ladies...

10
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,113
I assume you're all familiar

11
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,496
with the Ellison group's
latest acquisitions?

12
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,751
Mr. macklin.

13
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,756
Here it comes, hotshot.

14
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:29,266
I assume that you have read
Mr. ebersol's report

15
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:33,812
and you've come with your
usual accurate appraisal.

16
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:37,562
The acquisition
of these four breweries

17
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,273
that we've purchased
from our minor competitors

18
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:45,073
requires the guidance
of our top executive field men.

19
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:49,160
I've already selected three of them
from our western offices.

20
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:53,286
The fourth, and most important,

21
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,914
I place in the capable hands
of Mr. macklin.

22
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,420
I'm behind you 110%, sir.

23
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:03,960
Your in-house peer
will be Mr. ebersol.

24
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,511
You will report to him,
he will report to me.

25
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,429
Absolutely, sir.

26
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,965
What's his name?

27
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:15,937
Why don't I know his name?
What's his name, ebersol?

28
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,973
The...

29
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:23,778
The... the landlubber we bought
the brewery from in low...

30
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:24,865
What's this name?

31
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,441
- Charles w. Pickett.
- Pickett! Of course.

32
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:28,609
Yes, you're right.

33
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,613
Pickett's beer...

34
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:39,875
What the American
working man pickets for.

35
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,006
Wonderful slogan, sir.
They all are.

36
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,004
Write that down.

37
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,843
I'll expect glowing reports
from you.

38
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:54,347
We'll personally talk
when you get back from Iowa.

39
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,928
Why do I have to be the one
that goes to Iowa?

40
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,015
Should've read the report instead
of screwing your way across country.

41
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:05,025
Come on, a man's got to have time
to gather his body and soul.

42
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,065
You can only fake it for so long.

43
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,990
You get yourself
the dubuque star brewery.

44
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,490
Old man pickett
finally broke down.

45
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,498
God's gift to women better have
his body in Iowa by Friday,

46
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:20,331
or his soul is on welfare
on Monday. Read it and weep.

47
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:25,090
Four weeks to deliver
a 50% production increase.

48
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,633
Dubuque is my hometown.

49
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,962
I can't go there like some
corporate hatchetman

50
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,263
and make over that brewery
in four weeks.

51
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,217
The old man is building generals,
not buck privates.

52
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:38,054
This is a test,
my fair-haired wonderboy.

53
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,640
I've done a hell of a job.
Why am I being dumped on?

54
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:45,227
Dumped on? This is the biggie.
The gold key club.

55
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,278
You go down there,
get those monkeys in line,

56
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,822
you're gonna jump
to senior vice president so fast

57
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,151
that you'll
be giving orders to me.

58
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,952
On the other hand, you fall on
the proverbial tokhes-eroonie,

59
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,658
and you'll never stop falling.
Have a nice trip.

60
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:40,100
Hey, mister, what's this little car
gonna be when it grows up?

61
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,806
About a year
of your salary, friend.

62
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,432
You mean you paid $7,000
for this little thing?

63
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:49,987
Damn.

64
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,275
Damn.

65
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,183
Pop me a star, dude.

66
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,134
Blow it out your ass!

67
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:07,812
We're gonna be late, ray.

68
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,686
Come on, Turkey,
move that piece of junk!

69
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,002
It's the battle of the luxury cars!

70
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,509
Lincoln continental,
on American know-how and skill,

71
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,681
against the German machine.

72
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,454
See now? You see that sucker

73
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,832
flip this fine old vintage
American automobile the bird?

74
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,251
We're talking about
my country's honor, boy.

75
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,148
Come on! Come on, faggot!

76
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,152
- Damn you, jerks!
- I'm gonna tear your head off!

77
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,314
You stupid jerks! You know what
you could've done back there?

78
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:55,420
Oh, man. What are you
doing here?

79
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,667
You come back to buy
the whole town or something?

80
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,841
Anything left worth buying?

81
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:03,590
How you doing?

82
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,889
I'm doing the best I can
with what I got.

83
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:11,970
You are looking good,
all slicked up and ready to kick ass.

84
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,397
- Eh, Harry?
- Slicker than owl shit.

85
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,600
Just about slick enough
to pay us back

86
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,901
for those 4,000 beers you owe us.

87
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,569
You're on for that one.

88
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,324
Damn, I can't believe it's you.

89
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,111
Oh, shoot, we're gonna get fired.

90
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:31,039
I'm gonna collect for those beers
tonight at mooney's.

91
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,541
Just like old times.
What do you say?

92
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,703
Tonight? I can't make it tonight.
I got a meeting.

93
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,790
- Tomorrow night.
- Saturday night at mooney's.

94
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,092
Get yourself a deal, honcho.

95
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,387
Honcho? Jesus...

96
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,174
Say, viv!

97
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,605
Move it, come on.
Roach is on my case again.

98
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,311
Eat it, man.

99
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,699
- How you doing?
- Morning, Charmaine.

100
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,777
Binkowski!

101
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,493
Who's that dingo with roach?

102
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:03,252
Some computer guy. Been calling
around the brewery all day.

103
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:08,428
Now, you better quit
screwing around.

104
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:14,968
You got your queen-size bed,
your color TV.

105
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:18,309
Takes quarters, you can
get your change in the office...

106
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,890
Your sanitized drinking glasses.

107
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,948
Your deluxe John with ultraviolet
germ protection on the commode.

108
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:32,243
And your own private view
of the parking lot.

109
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:34,912
I'll bet when you was a kid

110
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:38,787
you never thought you'd stay
in one of Mrs. hinkle's deluxe rooms?

111
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,667
No, ma'am, I sure didn't.

112
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:43,041
Kind of like a dream come true,
ain't it?

113
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,293
It's like a dream, all right.

114
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:50,170
The deluxe massage is busted,
they want too much to fix it.

115
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,215
Screw 'em.
Coffee shop's still open.

116
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,226
I got to get to work.

117
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:03,520
Damn maid. Screw 'em.

118
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,605
To bigger and better.

119
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,740
Damn, that's good beer.
Be sorry to see it go.

120
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,901
Could stand another day
in ferment, Charlie.

121
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,161
By next week, won't matter anyway.

122
00:15:57,248 --> 00:16:01,537
It's a good move, Henry.
For the town and the brewery.

123
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,619
We are now responsible
to a nation of beer drinkers.

124
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,581
We're not operating a one-horse
brewery like my old man.

125
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,215
Makes no difference
if we're called star or pickett's.

126
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:14,763
We're in the loving arms of irreversible
and profitable progress.

127
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,892
Mr. pickett, Mr. macklin's here
from the company.

128
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,098
Show him in, Doreen.

129
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,031
They gotta be kidding.

130
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:37,610
Charlie, boys, how are you?

131
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,278
You're the man from Ellison?

132
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:43,207
We got a ton of work to do.
I suggest we get to it.

133
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:46,286
I want a complete tour
of all the operations.

134
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,079
You wait just one lousy minute.

135
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:51,416
I'm not having no kid that worked for me
snot-nosed out of high school

136
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,092
telling me how to run my brewery.

137
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,135
Study these proposals, boys.

138
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:58,298
I want the new equipment
checked and installed by Monday.

139
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:02,180
Monday? Half the stuff is in crates.
Your people only been here a week.

140
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,387
(Get someone on it.

141
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:07,224
The labeling has to be changed
and the stock recartoned.

142
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,149
Leon, that's still
your department?

143
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,821
Good. Henry, you follow
those new brewing specs,

144
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,364
we'll get along just fine.

145
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,866
We're gonna be turning out
a hell of a lot more beer

146
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:18,912
than you're used to.

147
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,736
I'll need a meeting
with all installers.

148
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:24,995
Pull 'em off in staggered shifts.
Make that 4:00, my office.

149
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:31,623
By the way, where is my office?

150
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,303
Come on, chop-chop here, will you?

151
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:43,760
Ho!

152
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,855
Hey, come on, keep it moving here.

153
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,684
This don't concern you.
Get back on the line.

154
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,019
- Come on.
- What's going on?

155
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:56,948
You blind? Don't know
new equipment when you see it?

156
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,820
We been took over.

157
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:00,864
Took over?

158
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,787
By what?

159
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,542
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

160
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:30,185
Big bossman. I love you
more than yesterday.

161
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:33,768
I can't believe frank's
heading up the whole shebang.

162
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:37,276
Ain't you the dummy today.

163
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,448
- I'm thinking.
- Thinking?

164
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,527
Drinking's better than thinking,
I'm gonna tell you.

165
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:46,865
How come I don't see your four-by?
Silver bullet scare her off?

166
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,701
Something gone bad around here.

167
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,081
You listen, sucker...
Come Sunday,

168
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:56,416
I'm gonna eat you for breakfast
and fart you out for lunch.

169
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,720
- He's pissin' on the car.
- Get out of here.

170
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,798
Silver bullet sounds pretty hot.

171
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:07,306
I wouldn't run that turd boiler
in a soapbox derby.

172
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:11,146
Things never change.

173
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,563
The installers and the supervisors
are here.

174
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,400
Send in the troops then.

175
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,739
This new equipment on these
machines should do the trick.

176
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,121
- Is this the last of the star?
- That's it.

177
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,123
From here on, it's all pickett.

178
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:52,184
All right, shut it down.
Works fine.

179
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,395
I don't know
about these old machines.

180
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:59,483
- This system's gonna run 'em...
- That's what I want. Hit it.

181
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:03,320
We been running more than
20 hours. Give us a break.

182
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:14,836
- Great! What's left?
- Labeler's in and running great.

183
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,962
Run me off some samples.

184
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,257
Terrific.

185
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,344
How about right-side up?

186
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,043
Hey, frank, how the hell are you?

187
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:43,962
Hey, Gus.

188
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:02,560
Hey, I know you.
Do you remember me?

189
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:06,398
- B-Jo Layton.
- Wow, you got some memory.

190
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,780
- I never forget a tongue.
- Hey, honcho.

191
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,285
Over here!

192
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,869
Lacy, set us up, baby.

193
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,377
He showed up.
I saw you and b-Jo over there.

194
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,004
That tongue is working
as hard as it ever did.

195
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:31,340
Hey, now, look at this here
fancy timepiece. P-i-a-g-e-t.

196
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,925
Pee-i-get. That's a hell of a name
for a fancy watch.

197
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,806
What's something like that cost?

198
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,354
You've got the manners
of $2 whore.

199
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,727
I'm worth at least four.

200
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:45,812
This fancy watch cost me
one long weekend in the sack

201
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:49,819
with the ugliest woman in Milwaukee
who owns sheep, snakes,

202
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,576
and a husband with the biggest
bottling business in town.

203
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:56,155
- Strictly a business proposition.
- You never change, you know?

204
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,496
Put another quarter in.
Let's play some cutthroat.

205
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:02,878
- Grab a cue, buddy. We'll talk.
- Frank, how you be?

206
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,751
Been a long time.

207
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:10,007
- Pretty good. How you doing?
- I'm overworked and underloved.

208
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:18,769
- About yesterday...
- Aw, shut up and break 'em.

209
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:20,938
I know you got
an image to protect.

210
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,644
Time comes,
you'll take care of your own.

211
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,529
I'm gonna get my wife Lacy up here.
Y'all give her a little hand.

212
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:18,746
You bust your chops
16 hours a day, 8 days a week,

213
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,782
and they'll be as ugly as you are.

214
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,911
You could give us some particulars.

215
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,247
Never knew when me and old ray

216
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,383
might wanna take off
just like you did sometime.

217
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,211
- You don't wanna go.
- Huh?

218
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,139
I said you don't wanna go.

219
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:39,763
What the hell do you know
about what I wanted?

220
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:45,435
You ain't been around here.
You don't know what I been into.

221
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:48,814
I went to junior college.
Didn't I go to junior college?

222
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:52,021
- Six months.
- Got me a "b" in police science.

223
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,573
Was gonna be a criminologist.

224
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,026
That's the intricate study of crime

225
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:59,407
and its cause and effect
on a given society.

226
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:07,666
And lenore,
she got pregnant again.

227
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,503
Why don't you make me
a delivery salesman

228
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,630
so I can wear one of those
leather bowties?

229
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,466
Lot of changes are gonna happen.

230
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,507
Hey, he says there're gonna
be some changes going down.

231
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,843
You think you're talking
to some fool off the street?

232
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,310
What has happened
since I left town?

233
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,651
Is j.M. Still around?

234
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,068
Yeah, she's still around.

235
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,158
She's around where?

236
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:48,287
She's around 36-24-36
and still hot for your... rod. Damn.

237
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,213
She never got out.

238
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:55,168
Oh, yeah, she got out,
then come back,

239
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:59,304
then left again, then come back
like some goddamned yo-yo.

240
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:08,181
Me and ray, we thought about you
a lot while you were gone.

241
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,518
That's the truth.

242
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,435
What do y'all say we go
to the company picnic tomorrow

243
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,145
and go down there and blow
them suckers out of the race?

244
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,152
- Be just like the old days...
- Can't. Gotta work.

245
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,905
Shit, man, even god
rested on Sunday.

246
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,657
That brewery ain't going nowhere.

247
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,864
I want you to see bigfoot.

248
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,574
I got these four-foot tires,
triple suspension...

249
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:32,629
I told you, I can't. I gotta work.

250
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,124
Take a rain check, huh?

251
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:42,674
Hey, who is this? Didn't I always
take care of business?

252
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:45,680
Hmm? And the first
point of business

253
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,308
is to take care of j.M. Halstead,
isn't that right?

254
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,339
Bank says I need collateral.

255
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:25,049
They say working the same job
for 17 years, that's not collateral.

256
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:31,185
Seems a man's gotta have money
to get it, doesn't it?

257
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,275
Thank you, ma'am.

258
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,400
Sorry.

259
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,194
Thank you.

260
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:48,072
You're not here about the plant
layoffs. I can't do anything...

261
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,167
Well, I'm not.

262
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,835
Oh, my god.

263
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,544
It's you.

264
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,045
Yeah, it's me.

265
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:02,970
I told you all that fast living
was gonna ruin your eyes.

266
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,472
You're the man
from the corporation.

267
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,553
- The brewery.
- Yeah.

268
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,761
Because of you, a whole stream
of people have been in here today

269
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,642
scared to death
about being laid off.

270
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:16,229
What if I told you
I'm taking care of business?

271
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:22,482
- We have some talking to do.
- Hey... slow down.

272
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:28,788
Make sure Mr. oswald keeps
his job and give him a raise.

273
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,614
You're kidding.

274
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,623
That remains to be seen.

275
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:37,955
You take me
to all the best places.

276
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:42,134
- You never complained before.
- I know. I've changed.

277
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,382
Haven't we all...

278
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:48,057
A hamburger, some drinks,
and some old times.

279
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,350
Old times here are best forgotten.

280
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,603
Aha. One burger,
hold the old times!

281
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,142
Look, how many people
you planning to let go?

282
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:03,698
As few as possible. Mostly old timers
that are well into pension time.

283
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:10,662
That's awful. You can't let people go
like that, like they're old plow horses.

284
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,915
- It's not even good business.
- Just trimming the fat.

285
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:17,210
After we get rolling,
we'll be creating new jobs.

286
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,288
It's the macklin formula.

287
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:24,593
Miss Jean, are you coming
to the picnic?

288
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,216
Yeah. Are you?

289
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,011
That's the story of my life.

290
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,302
So how's yours been
the last ten years?

291
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:39,643
I went to college, got married
to a smart-ass preppy,

292
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,603
put the ungrateful son of a bitch
through dental school,

293
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:47,943
went back, got my masters
in sociology and divorce training,

294
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:51,995
got an "a" in both,
and here I am home again.

295
00:29:55,127 --> 00:30:01,794
Dentists make good money,
steady husbands. What happened?

296
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,755
He used to practice
his lab classes on me.

297
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:09,930
I got tired of being drilled
and filled in the same night.

298
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,262
- No points.
- No points.

299
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,854
I really missed you.

300
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,905
Still lying.

301
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:31,990
I'd have stayed in dubuque
if you had.

302
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,791
And done what? Got married?
Had 2.6 kids?

303
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,201
Got a job at the brewery

304
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:41,287
so you could stay in debt
the rest of our lives?

305
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:46,550
It wasn't you, and it wasn't me.
And we both knew it.

306
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,627
I loved you, j.M.

307
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,178
- Promise me something.
- Ifl can.

308
00:30:54,269 --> 00:31:00,731
That you'll be fair and open-minded
and do right by people of this town.

309
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,356
You sure know how
to change the subject.

310
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:10,483
Call me. The number's in the book.

311
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,833
Blue 19.19.

312
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,546
Hut-hut. Hut.

313
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,510
Ball! Get him!

314
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,638
Look in the bag.

315
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,018
Do I know my man,
or do I know my man?

316
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,816
- It's all right?
- God damn it.

317
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,643
It's all right.

318
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,859
Do I know my man,
or do I know my man?

319
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,523
Hurry up.
Get that shirt over here.

320
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,200
- Gimme the shirt.
- Son of a...

321
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,622
I'm gonna get you...

322
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,954
Gimme the shirt.
Get him up, man.

323
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:47,458
God damn it, you jerk-off!
What are you guys doing?

324
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,543
Get off my gut!

325
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,750
You come in here
like you're king shit,

326
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,340
like old Harry don't know
who you are...

327
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:02,557
Now, there. That's who you are.
Let's go kick us some ass.

328
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:41,363
Looks like our corporate executive
is out to soak up the local color.

329
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:46,248
Yeah. He's a hard bone
for me to swallow.

330
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:50,126
You would live up
a chinaman's rear end

331
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,044
for the kind of deal we got.

332
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,878
You guys would be better off with
someone else driving. I'm rusty.

333
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,754
If you're ashamed
to be with us, just say so.

334
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:01,884
Come on.

335
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,844
Don't shit me, honcho.

336
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,640
What's going on, huh?

337
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:48,598
I get $500 says our hero
takes the race from the man in yellow.

338
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,854
You can count me in.

339
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:57,937
That boy's a shark
in a pool full of goldfish.

340
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,110
You missed!

341
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,816
Come on, frank!

342
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:11,198
- God, the mud.
- Come on.

343
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:43,943
Basic human nature.

344
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,542
- You're a bastard, you know?
- I know.

345
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,460
Let's make love.

346
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:35,342
That's what I like...
A long, healthy relationship

347
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:36,881
and all the right words.

348
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,058
I know. I'm a real smoothie, huh?

349
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:03,287
- Closet.
- Oh, shit.

350
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:13,422
Bathroom. Let's take a shower.

351
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,427
No!

352
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,219
I like my sex dirty.

353
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:28,684
No strings. No commitments.

354
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,526
That's easier for you to say.

355
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,564
Will you still respect me
in the morning?

356
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,615
You won't be here in the morning.

357
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:51,919
I missed you. I really did.

358
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,891
I used to be able
to do this with one hand.

359
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,735
Front latch. Imagine that.

360
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,317
Does everything else
work the same?

361
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:23,742
Less girl, more woman. And you?

362
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:28,952
I was shot in the war zone.
Raised my voice two octaves.

363
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:35,302
Liar.

364
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,228
Hang on a minute.

365
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:01,828
What's going on?

366
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,871
Give this to ray.
It'll explain everything.

367
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,462
Son of a bitch.
They've put me in racking.

368
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,137
Let me see.

369
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,307
Better talk to reach.
Probably a mistake.

370
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,059
There must be. I'm a bottler.

371
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,191
I ain't no racker, that's for sure.

372
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,946
I want to officially welcome you
to the Ellison group of companies

373
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,618
and to pickett's beer.

374
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:48,368
The Ellison group realizes
a lot of you are set in your ways,

375
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,791
but I think you'll find
our method of operation

376
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:54,041
will make for a higher output
and smoother running machine.

377
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:57,249
I know you've noticed
there've been some changes

378
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,880
and modifications
in job situations.

379
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:03,805
There will be people here
to help you over the rough spots.

380
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:08,931
I know you'll want pickett's to be
everything star beer was and more.

381
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,395
Thank you.

382
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,973
Bullshit!

383
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,228
Who said that?

384
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,277
Who said that?

385
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:23,316
You people better learn
which side your bread's buttered on.

386
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:29,197
All right, let's start it up!

387
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:00,983
This thing farts out bottles all daylong
and don't need no one, huh?

388
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,109
Can't you read your form?
You're in racking.

389
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:04,782
I'm a bottler, man.

390
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,453
- I said you're in racking.
- I'm a bottler.

391
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,909
Come on.

392
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:36,689
Hey! Old man! You're in bunging.

393
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,146
- Bunging?
- Yeah!

394
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:44,857
- I don't know nothing about...
- Then you learn! Come on.

395
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,364
You got a beef?

396
00:45:56,671 --> 00:46:00,209
You ain't a priest. Anybody
got a bitch, you send 'em to me.

397
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:03,336
But they're coming to me, Marvin,
and I'm coming to see you.

398
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,385
There've been four people fired
off the bottling floor today.

399
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,546
You're the union rep.
What are you gonna do?

400
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:12,183
This is a small town. I gotta do
what I think's best for the majority.

401
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,385
That's what I thought.

402
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:16,391
You wanna shut it down,
you wanna go on strike?

403
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,807
We got growing pains.
Things'll work out.

404
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:22,860
They got the line going so fast,

405
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:26,030
I damn near hammered
my thumb into the bung hole.

406
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:33,947
That brew is bad.

407
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,783
- Did you talk to frank yet?
- He's in a meeting.

408
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,584
How's about after lunch?

409
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,417
Shit, you got a mouth.
Why don't you ask him yourself?

410
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,582
He's your good buddy, ain't he?

411
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:47,919
- Stuff it.
- You gonna eat your chips?

412
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:08,648
I wonder if you'd do me a favor.

413
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:13,282
I ain't gonna make it in that warehouse.
You and the boss are good friends...

414
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:15,868
Shit, cleach.

415
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,324
How many loads do we have
going out this afternoon?

416
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:21,460
- Two with about 5,000 cases.
- I wanna talk to you.

417
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:24,505
- You got a problem?
- Jimmy, go on.

418
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,714
- I don't owe you this.
- Why'd you move ray to racking?

419
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:33,673
- He's been a bottler for ten years.
- When you automate, jobs change.

420
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:36,138
Other people
had to be redistributed.

421
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:39,304
Distributed. Why don't you
say fired when you mean fired?

422
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:44,984
I don't know you anymore. I don't know
what kind of man you've turned into.

423
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:47,645
I got a job to do.

424
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,314
Don't do that.

425
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:55,115
Why not? You gonna fire me, too?
You don't remember me, do you?

426
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:56,696
Remember the time I held your head

427
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:59,498
while you cried like a baby
the day your mama died?

428
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:02,080
How about ray?
Eight stitches in his arm

429
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:05,413
when that asshole came at you
with a broken bottle at mooney's.

430
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:14,718
How many times have I told you,
you keep telegraphing your punch?

431
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:19,226
Go on back, please?

432
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,510
Heard you had some trouble
this afternoon.

433
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:05,018
They teach you in college how to handle
a bunch of angry workers?

434
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:06,940
I'm busy. Get to the point.

435
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:09,860
Get rid of the troublemakers now.

436
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,021
Thanks for the advice.

437
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:14,949
You don't pull this off, you're up
shit creek without a paddle.

438
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,366
Keep pushing.

439
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:19,321
I'm not pushing. Just trying to help.

440
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:23,158
I know I'm a high-paid flunky
like you now, but...

441
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:26,744
You don't out these people off
at the knees, they'll bury you.

442
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:31,416
I'm tired. I've got a lot of work
to do before I can go home.

443
00:49:32,845 --> 00:49:35,882
You sure do, boy.

444
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:50,856
You've done a heck of a job,
and you deserve the best.

445
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,608
You deserve the full body
of pickett's beer.

446
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,773
In the finest tradition
of the brewer's art,

447
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,112
choice western hops,
sun-ripened grains

448
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:00,278
blended with clear, cold
mountain water

449
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:03,823
to give you that 100%
natural taste of cold gold.

450
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:06,375
Pickett's... when only
the best will do.

451
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:16,469
- What have we got, Harvard?
- The ad campaign is first rate.

452
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:20,139
The projection from the breweries
producing at present capacity

453
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:23,389
should offer a very good picture
at the onset of purchase,

454
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:25,811
if there is retention
of the pickett's image

455
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,392
as offered by the Ellison group.

456
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:32,978
Would you mind translating that
into plain-old galveston english?

457
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,988
I think what Mikey
is trying to say is that,

458
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:39,491
let's say you had four cows
living in four different barns,

459
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:42,654
you could move three of them
in with one barn so that...

460
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:47,040
Those breweries will be producing
enough beer to flood the market.

461
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:50,711
All you gotta do is sit back
and watch your competitors

462
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:53,961
sink deeper and deeper and deeper.

463
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,920
That's awful interesting.

464
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:58,673
When are we gonna get a chance
to see these breweries?

465
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:04,597
Harry Jr., Patty Ann,
come on, get down here.

466
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:07,850
- You're making me late for work.
- Coming!

467
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,356
You gonna eat, or what?

468
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,695
Where'd you get your manners,
in a barnyard?

469
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:30,205
Would you please mind
passing the milk, father?

470
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:36,549
You hear Clarence beaver's
hernia's acting up?

471
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:38,300
Yeah, I heard.

472
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:41,754
He says he'll teach me right
so it don't happen to me.

473
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:46,054
If I ever catch you within
ten miles of that brewery,

474
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:49,637
I'm gonna break both your legs
with an ax handle, you got me?

475
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:54,351
You're going to college, boy,
if I have to drag you there myself.

476
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:57,653
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, sir.

477
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:01,194
He was making conversation.

478
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:06,578
If I need conversation,
I'll buy me a goddamn parrot.

479
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:11,951
You didn't tell me
Clarence's hernia's acting up.

480
00:52:12,004 --> 00:52:14,791
They've speeded up the line
three times this week.

481
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,249
Bottling's no picnic, either.

482
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:20,418
Suppose I kiss you?

483
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:23,633
You'll bite my head off?

484
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:48,700
Okay... now let it out.

485
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:53,075
Ain't nothing to let out.

486
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:13,179
Honey, you've gotta talk to me.

487
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:16,857
'Cause if you're thinking
of quitting your job, I gotta know.

488
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:18,855
I do wanna quit.

489
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,147
But you know
I can't do anything else.

490
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,212
- Where's Harry?
- He didn't come in.

491
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:43,338
- Did he call in sick?
- Nah, he ain't here. Ray neither.

492
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:46,970
Where's your hardhat?

493
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:49,848
I can't find it.

494
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:55,513
I drank 15 beers, and that's
a whole lot of brew in one night

495
00:53:55,566 --> 00:54:02,688
when you're trying to drown
the memory from your mind

496
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:06,528
it took me 15 beers to get here

497
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:09,694
I don't know
how many more till I leave

498
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:13,740
- I'll take my change in tears
- Two, three, four...

499
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:17,042
And drink 15 beers here

500
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:23,424
when you're trying to drown
the memory from your mind

501
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:27,553
it took me 15 beers to get here

502
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:31,511
I don't know
how many more till I leave

503
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:35,345
- take my change in tears
- Two, three, four...

504
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:38,647
And drink my 15 beers

505
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:42,943
I thought I'd have three or four
just to loosen up

506
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,691
- loosen up.
- Loosen up.

507
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:49,742
'Cause we was really
gonna swing tonight

508
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:54,656
I could almost see
her long red face

509
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,332
and touch her long red hair

510
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:10,421
Chaser.

511
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:14,470
You guys just won't
give me a break.

512
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:18,221
I say I got everything
under control, but, no...

513
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:21,561
You gotta have everything
go only the fricking way you want!

514
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:27,439
I am building an a-number-one
brewery over there, but you...

515
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:34,653
I'm trying to make something
for your damn future.

516
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:37,160
I ain't got no goddamn future.

517
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:40,664
We get right new, today.

518
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:44,505
Maybe tomorrow,
but that is it, Jack.

519
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,590
You just don't remember.

520
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:51,628
I thought I was gonna
be one of them delivery salesmen,

521
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:54,430
wear one of those leather bowties.

522
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:57,760
Instead, I'm putting
puke beer in barrels.

523
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:24,786
Look what you did.

524
00:56:29,428 --> 00:56:30,884
I don't like it in racking.

525
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:35,343
I want my old job back.

526
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,550
You can't have it.

527
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:42,812
- The machine does it.
- Screw the machines!

528
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,980
Leave him alone.

529
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:11,918
What do you want from me?
I got my own job to do!

530
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:30,944
You are taking too much of this
on your shoulders.

531
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:36,029
It sure is a true-blue bitch.

532
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:40,954
I have lived here for 52 years,

533
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:44,491
and I never seen anybody
in dubuque yet go but one way...

534
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:50,839
Pick up a check for eight hours,
spend the next day pissing it away.

535
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:54,134
Got three color tvs
in a shack of a house,

536
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:57,554
$12,000 worth of pick-up
in the garage,

537
00:57:57,641 --> 00:58:00,303
and they got a fishing boat
they drag out on weekends

538
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:05,605
so they can get drunk and swap lies
about the good life that don't exist.

539
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:12,940
Sounds like my old man,
god rest him.

540
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,773
And sometimes...

541
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:22,245
We even fished in between
the lies and the dreams.

542
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:28,703
He is the same people who'll fold
like a gambler with a pair of threes.

543
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:35,130
And I say, "screw 'em, and
one, two, three, get yourself out."

544
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,043
You ain't got
the brains of a baboon.

545
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:40,176
I told you freight shipment
on cans be here ready at 2:00.

546
00:58:40,267 --> 00:58:43,600
You haven't done a damn thing
all day but just stand here.

547
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:46,599
- You look at me when I'm yelling...
- What the hell is going on here?

548
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:49,894
You send me ten new guys
from who knows where,

549
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:52,397
and not one of them
knows his ass from a case of beer.

550
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,648
And this nitwit...
He's a prize package.

551
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:57,110
They all know their job.
They're shining you on.

552
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,658
Yeah? Try and get 'em to work
when they don't wanna be here.

553
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:10,787
Listen up, mister. If you don't
get on the stick damn quick,

554
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:14,214
you're gonna find yourself
back in that welfare line.

555
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:21,513
You fill out this dispatcher's form
and get that load to the dock.

556
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,970
You don't need
a college degree for that.

557
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:27,519
You think you can handle that?
Read it to me.

558
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,522
Can't read.

559
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:41,487
You can't read?

560
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:45,904
I work on the bottling floor,
Mr. macklin.

561
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:00,635
You go on back.

562
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,429
I'll clear it.

563
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:17,228
I'm sending him back to bottling.
You have till tomorrow to shape up.

564
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:24,451
Adjust the number-three pickers.
The neck labels are flagging.

565
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:26,369
Doing it all day.

566
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:40,380
It's dick ebersol. Where are you,
inside a cement mixer?

567
01:00:41,263 --> 01:00:44,630
I just got the computer printouts,
and production in your plant

568
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:47,966
is the highest of all four plants.
Way to go, hotshot.

569
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:50,097
I can hardly hear you!

570
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:53,059
Put your finger in your ear
and listen up!

571
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:57,610
I am coming down your way
with our moneyman,

572
01:00:57,696 --> 01:01:00,563
and I want to put on
3 little show for him.

573
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:04,358
Take every can and bottle you got
and stack 'em up in the warehouse.

574
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:07,319
Make it look nice for the buyer,
you know what I mean?

575
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:10,577
Buyer?! What are you
talking about?

576
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:15,585
I'm talking about corporate history.
Start to finish in four weeks

577
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:19,339
with a clear profit of...
Are you ready... $27.6 million.

578
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:21,963
The old man is just about
spitting up with delight.

579
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:26,346
We're gonna take all four breweries,
dump 'em in one neat package

580
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:28,347
right in the lap of some
squint-eyed texan

581
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:31,009
who happened to find oll
underneath his outhouse.

582
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:34,141
You and yours truly
happen to be sitting rather pretty.

583
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:39,151
You gotta be crazy! What does
he know about breweries?!

584
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:43,150
This plant could fold in six months.
It has to be nursed along.

585
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:47,990
I can hardly hear you. I got to go.
Hopalong Cassidy's getting antsy.

586
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:50,700
See you in a couple days,
buddy. Bye-bye.

587
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,575
God damn it, dick!

588
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:58,502
Shit.

589
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:38,118
Doreen, will you come in, please?

590
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:47,378
I want you to copy these changes
exactly as written.

591
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:49,261
Get 'em xeroxed
for each department head

592
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:50,387
and bring 'em back to me.

593
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:53,512
Ring up racking, warehouse,
brewing, and bottling in that order.

594
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:57,642
Should I carbon copy
the home office?

595
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:59,768
You do,
and I'll break your pencils.

596
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:13,161
- I can't keep 'em running like this.
- Shut up and tighten it down.

597
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:16,952
It won't go no more. Hold it.

598
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:24,422
Virgil, you all right?

599
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:27,300
Oh, shit, man!

600
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:31,338
You gotta be kidding.
We just got up to 1,700 a minute.

601
01:03:31,433 --> 01:03:35,722
Shut up and listen. Drop it back
to 1,200 and do it now.

602
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,977
It's my responsibility, right?

603
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:46,064
Get you upstairs.

604
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:49,777
Shit. I'll get you upstairs.
Come on.

605
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:53,114
What's going on?

606
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:56,488
I don't know. Come on.

607
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,746
- What's with him?
- Taking him upstairs.

608
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:03,411
What's with the slowdown?

609
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:06,669
Your buddy upstairs
can't make up his damn mind.

610
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:10,127
Slow it down, speed it up. He wants
the damn thing slowed down now!

611
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,795
- Damn!
- I don't feel so good.

612
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:12,890
Come on.

613
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:59,847
Car trouble? I'll trade you even
for my Lincoln.

614
01:05:01,523 --> 01:05:04,390
I guess you'll probably
be needing a lift.

615
01:05:07,195 --> 01:05:08,731
What's going on?

616
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:12,193
Your car didn't work.

617
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:37,055
Do you guys mind telling me
what the hell is going on?

618
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,180
Nothing.

619
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:40,884
Surprise!

620
01:05:44,232 --> 01:05:46,018
All right.

621
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:53,195
Welcome home, honcho!

622
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:56,650
Just our little way of saying
thanks for slowing down the line.

623
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:39,902
I learned that
playing the harmonica.

624
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:44,330
Sure, she did.

625
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:47,204
Gotta stand in line
just to kiss him.

626
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:52,501
Long line.

627
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:05,681
How about you? You love him?

628
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:08,054
Who?

629
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:12,768
That's an unfair question.

630
01:07:15,323 --> 01:07:19,282
We're very deeply in like.

631
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:22,778
Man, I blew it.

632
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,956
When corporate headquarters
hears about this,

633
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:30,994
the defecation is definitely
gonna contact the rotary oscillator.

634
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:33,416
Huh?

635
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:37,212
The shit's gonna hit the fan.

636
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:41,720
Hell with them sons of bitches.

637
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:49,141
There ain't a man in this room
wouldn't work his ass off for you.

638
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:53,979
It's too late.

639
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:59,147
Good-bye, Mercedes.
Hello, Volkswagen.

640
01:08:03,538 --> 01:08:05,529
Would you like to buy
my condomimium?

641
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:07,454
My condomumiam?

642
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,200
My apartment?

643
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:21,090
You guys know how much money
I make in a year?

644
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:23,421
Take a guess.

645
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,891
- Go ahead.
- A shitpot.

646
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:34,857
Gimme the football.

647
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:41,606
Man wants the ball.

648
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:46,069
Let's give him the ball.

649
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:53,038
Back wall's our goal,
kitchen's yours.

650
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:55,294
Two out of three.
Loser pays the damages.

651
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:18,647
Blue 19.19. Hut-hut.

652
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:00,605
23.

653
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:06,358
46. Go deep. Hut! Hut! Hut!

654
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:26,260
You son of a bitch. You bit me.

655
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:41,101
Boo!

656
01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:22,775
Your fly's open. There's some
little thing hanging out there.

657
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:01,598
Okay, so we don't know
what Mr. macklin's game is.

658
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:03,983
I tell you,
we let this thing continue,

659
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:07,236
Ellison'll pull out of here faster than
a gypsy roofing company.

660
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:10,114
We have signed contracts.

661
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:13,026
And they have lawyers.

662
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:16,612
It's our duty to inform the
home office of Mr. macklin's actions

663
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:19,665
before they find out themselves
and slap a lock on the door.

664
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:21,993
Then we'll all be looking for jobs.

665
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:25,580
Suppose you could make
a few calls.

666
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:29,042
Not me. I'm just
a small-town grain broker

667
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:31,218
and former company president.

668
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:34,172
No, it's gotta come
from lower down the ladder.

669
01:12:34,225 --> 01:12:36,307
A forthright appraisement
of the situation.

670
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:40,971
It's a weekend. I'll call Ellison
first thing Monday.

671
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:45,399
Come Monday,
you might be out of a job.

672
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:48,603
Thank you, Mr. loomis,
for your concerned judgment.

673
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:55,319
Yes, good-bye. And all your
small-minded, greedy little natures.

674
01:12:57,748 --> 01:12:59,534
Find Mr. ebersol.

675
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:05,169
He's pitching for
the company team today?

676
01:13:05,256 --> 01:13:06,837
Get him here.

677
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:18,219
Thank you.

678
01:13:52,887 --> 01:13:54,878
You wanted to see me, sir?

679
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:06,768
- Mr. ebersol.
- Yes, sir.

680
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:08,770
You seem to have a problem.

681
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,852
A problem, sir?

682
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:14,485
I assume that
Mr. macklin and yourself

683
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:17,317
are responsible for the care
and the grooming

684
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:19,402
of the dubuque star acquisition.

685
01:14:19,497 --> 01:14:21,328
Absolutely, sir.

686
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:25,579
Then I can also assume that if
you don't wish to join Mr. macklin

687
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:28,119
in his search for new employment,

688
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:32,256
you will determine the form
of insanity that possesses him,

689
01:14:32,343 --> 01:14:35,335
correct the situation post haste,

690
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:39,013
before Mr. hooker
and his natural-gas millions

691
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:41,807
are given the tour of that
particular brewery.

692
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:44,852
Do you understand the situation?

693
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:56,735
Perfect.

694
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:11,044
Oh, shit.

695
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:14,422
What the hell are you doing here?

696
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:18,711
You rotten, back-stabbing
son of a bitch!

697
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:20,717
It's nice to see you, too.

698
01:15:20,808 --> 01:15:23,800
I just flew 400 miles down here
to say that to your face.

699
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:25,889
Have a nice flight back.

700
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:28,642
Hey, you're in big trouble.

701
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:31,148
Okay, hotshot?
I'm in no mood to bullshit.

702
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:33,184
Here it is right between the eyes.

703
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:35,691
You get that brewery
back to full production,

704
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:39,028
or I am authorized
to pull the plug, you got it?

705
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:42,910
Dick, Jane. Jane, dick.

706
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:46,197
See Jane shake hands with dick.

707
01:15:47,126 --> 01:15:51,495
What is this? It's me. We been
through the wars together.

708
01:15:51,589 --> 01:15:53,921
Don't do the buddy shit on me.

709
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:58,376
You got two days
to get your act together,

710
01:15:58,429 --> 01:16:03,924
to get those goonies back to work,
and to get home... where you belong!

711
01:16:04,435 --> 01:16:05,720
Got it?

712
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:11,681
And remember, hotshot, two days.

713
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,189
I don't like that man.

714
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:22,445
You mean everything's
going back the way it was?

715
01:16:22,536 --> 01:16:24,777
Yep. Message came down
from the mountain.

716
01:16:24,872 --> 01:16:27,238
Let me drive. You go ahead
and have your heart attack.

717
01:16:28,626 --> 01:16:32,585
Where are you taking me?
What the hell's going on?

718
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:35,250
J.m., I've gotta get to work.

719
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:38,840
What are you doing?

720
01:16:41,388 --> 01:16:44,926
Would you give me those keys?

721
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:46,434
Now, damn it.

722
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:50,307
Now I'm an accessory
to breaking and entering.

723
01:16:50,397 --> 01:16:52,683
Gimme the keys. I'm driving.

724
01:16:53,776 --> 01:16:57,189
Jane Margaret,
I am in no mood for this.

725
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:04,071
They made specialty beers here
only a few years ago.

726
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,743
Wait a second.
You're not serious?

727
01:17:15,506 --> 01:17:17,747
You're not packing a full sea bag.

728
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:21,133
Do you realize what it would take
to get this place started?

729
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:24,295
Yes. Everybody makes a little
commitment. What, $100,000?

730
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:27,302
Try a million.
And that's a big maybe.

731
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:29,842
Even if you could get
the money, which you can't,

732
01:17:29,937 --> 01:17:32,553
Ellison would bury you in a week.

733
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:35,018
Listen, I love you,
but you don't know

734
01:17:35,109 --> 01:17:37,475
what conglomerates
do to competition.

735
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:41,688
I think you're scared.
I think you're even scared of me...

736
01:17:41,782 --> 01:17:43,898
What might happen to
the precious macklin way of life

737
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:45,949
if you commit yourself
to something unsafe.

738
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:48,611
- I have to go to work.
- Come on, please?

739
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:52,953
If you won't take a chance for me,
then for Harry and ray

740
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:55,334
and anyone else who's
crazy enough to take a risk.

741
01:18:04,138 --> 01:18:06,129
You're not being fair.

742
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:09,094
I know. I love playing dirty.

743
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:14,103
You told me that
you would stay if I would.

744
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:17,310
I'm not going anywhere.

745
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:22,812
Okay, we've gotta get
the raw goods set up,

746
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:27,404
the salespeople and whatever
to run the shipping and the offices.

747
01:18:27,494 --> 01:18:28,984
And then, by some miracle,

748
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:31,871
we have to get this place
cleaned up and working,

749
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:35,996
and then... we'll be ready
for the first batch.

750
01:18:37,254 --> 01:18:38,710
Are there any questions?

751
01:18:38,797 --> 01:18:42,540
$8,000 per family... that's
a pretty big chunk, isn't it?

752
01:18:42,593 --> 01:18:46,006
Cleach, that's
only the seed money.

753
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:49,889
We'll get the rest from my bank
on real property collateral loans.

754
01:18:49,934 --> 01:18:52,550
Shit, there's that word
collateral again.

755
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:54,055
You got a car, don't you?

756
01:18:54,104 --> 01:18:58,723
We got cars, tvs, furniture...
That's collateral.

757
01:18:58,817 --> 01:19:03,561
These here machines
are pretty old. I can fix 'em.

758
01:19:03,614 --> 01:19:06,230
Don't worry about it.
Some'll raise more, some less.

759
01:19:06,325 --> 01:19:08,361
It'll even out.
We all have to work together.

760
01:19:08,452 --> 01:19:13,116
- How many kids are you feeding?
- And what if it doesn't work?

761
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:15,072
I got seven kids.

762
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:25,671
All right. There are no guarantees.
Not for me, not for you, not for anyone.

763
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:28,426
But if you wanna
go for the gold ring,

764
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:31,802
you have one chance
in a thousand, and this is it.

765
01:19:32,726 --> 01:19:35,968
If you don't, you tell me
right now, and I'm out of here.

766
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:41,307
What's it gonna be?

767
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:52,318
You said you'd make me
a salesman, right?

768
01:19:52,413 --> 01:19:53,413
That's right.

769
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:01,122
I'll give you the pink slip
to my truck.

770
01:20:01,171 --> 01:20:02,411
What?

771
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:06,048
There's something
out there somewhere.

772
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:10,094
I get almost $17,000 saved.
I could put that in.

773
01:20:18,272 --> 01:20:20,058
What have we got in pledges?

774
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:24,233
Comes to 27,028.09.

775
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:27,153
That's terrific.
Where'd we get the nine cents?

776
01:20:27,197 --> 01:20:29,609
Patricia Ann Meade. $3.09.
Babysitting money.

777
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:32,445
We'll offer him nine cents more
a bushel than he gets from pickett.

778
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:36,612
- What'd that guy say?
- He said yes and no.

779
01:20:38,709 --> 01:20:40,245
At least that's a start.

780
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:44,500
Like everyone else, he's just afraid
of losing pickett's business.

781
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:45,670
What's the count?

782
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:49,626
Six no's, three maybes,
and one "get the hell off my land."

783
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:05,482
- Take care.
- See you later.

784
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:07,017
Take it easy.

785
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:20,076
Is that you?

786
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:24,702
Madelyn... is that you?

787
01:21:31,011 --> 01:21:33,753
I was driving down
to my sister's wedding...

788
01:21:33,847 --> 01:21:36,930
And I thought you might
like some company.

789
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:40,051
I hope you've been a good boy.

790
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:45,393
Sure. I was just surprised
to see you sitting there

791
01:21:45,484 --> 01:21:47,600
with old what's his name here.

792
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:51,103
You never remember
Churchill's name.

793
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:54,690
He's a bad boy, isn't he?

794
01:22:00,874 --> 01:22:03,240
What is that smell?

795
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:05,246
Probably pig doc-doc, darling.

796
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:08,037
I'm taking you to the shower,

797
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:10,627
and then I'm going to burn
these awful clothes.

798
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:13,379
Listen, would you like to get
another room by yourself

799
01:22:13,429 --> 01:22:15,465
down at the holiday inn,
just off the highway?

800
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:18,218
You could probably make it
real early right out of there,

801
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:20,098
your sister's wedding, you know...

802
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:21,766
I don't have to be there till Friday.

803
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:23,515
- Friday, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

804
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:26,062
Which means I have
two whole days...

805
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:28,562
Yes, two days.

806
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:30,100
To take care of you.

807
01:22:30,154 --> 01:22:32,019
Two days.

808
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:43,864
Shoo.

809
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:49,540
Oh, no.

810
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:51,622
It's cold.

811
01:22:57,931 --> 01:22:59,842
Avon lady.

812
01:23:01,351 --> 01:23:03,433
Anybody home?

813
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:14,645
Hello in there.

814
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:19,200
It's the sandman
come to tuck you in beddy-bye.

815
01:23:21,121 --> 01:23:22,952
Are you all right?

816
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:30,835
I'm taking a shower.

817
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:37,130
Who is that?

818
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:42,426
I'm sorry.

819
01:23:44,478 --> 01:23:46,093
I don't usually...

820
01:23:51,527 --> 01:23:53,438
Oh, hell.

821
01:24:02,454 --> 01:24:04,991
Leon's got our boy tied up
for a good three hours.

822
01:24:05,082 --> 01:24:07,869
You get those people
in my office, pronto.

823
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:14,918
Can you believe the audacity
of those simple-minded jackasses

824
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:17,966
to think they can open up
another brewery in this town?

825
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:19,967
And you... how can you
be so stupid

826
01:24:20,013 --> 01:24:22,504
to let the county have the lease
on that old brewery?

827
01:24:22,558 --> 01:24:24,298
That's a tax shelter.

828
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:27,351
They can't get enough grain
to fill a mash kettle.

829
01:24:27,437 --> 01:24:29,519
Get your head out of your keister.

830
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:32,227
We got competition
on our doorstep.

831
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:34,057
We'll lose 20, 30 key personnel.

832
01:24:34,152 --> 01:24:35,892
How's that gonna sit
with the home office?

833
01:24:35,988 --> 01:24:38,070
Not too good.

834
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:40,565
You bet your left nut.

835
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:44,034
Those monkeys get here,
I want them to understand

836
01:24:44,121 --> 01:24:46,783
they will be clapped in jail
for infringement of rights.

837
01:24:46,873 --> 01:24:49,615
I don't think we got
a rights infringement case here.

838
01:24:49,710 --> 01:24:51,120
- You a lawyer now?
- No.

839
01:24:51,211 --> 01:24:54,624
Neither are they. I'll have them
shaking in their boots so fast,

840
01:24:54,715 --> 01:24:57,081
they'll beg for a drop in pay
to stay on the line.

841
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:02,047
Not this garbage. Get me a star.

842
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:03,587
What's the deal?

843
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:06,298
I think we're fixing
to get nailed to the cross.

844
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:08,766
Where the hell is frank?

845
01:25:11,481 --> 01:25:14,723
All right, everyone inside,
single-file.

846
01:25:17,529 --> 01:25:19,736
We can talk, or you can walk.

847
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:34,626
What time did Harry say?

848
01:25:34,671 --> 01:25:36,457
About 8:00.

849
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,467
I couldn't get out myself
till after 7:00.

850
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:48,385
They had a mix-up
with the holding tanks.

851
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:52,720
- Look...
- Please...

852
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:55,187
You're a grown man.

853
01:25:55,275 --> 01:25:57,891
If dogs and showers
are your thing, then who am I[...

854
01:25:57,986 --> 01:26:00,728
- She was an old friend.
- I certainly hope so.

855
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:04,565
She came for her sister's wedding.
I didn't expect her to show up.

856
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:07,613
Look, she took her dog and left.

857
01:26:07,704 --> 01:26:10,912
I don't have the slightest interest
in your sexual escapades.

858
01:26:21,635 --> 01:26:23,500
Where is everybody?

859
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:30,762
Shit, honcho. It was
a damn fool idea to start with.

860
01:26:34,147 --> 01:26:35,557
What are you talking about?

861
01:26:35,649 --> 01:26:40,393
It can't work. We're nothing but
a bunch of dumb-ass clockpunchers.

862
01:26:40,487 --> 01:26:44,605
- We ain't never gonna change.
- It needs time, commitment.

863
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:46,406
Let it go.

864
01:26:47,285 --> 01:26:49,116
They hold all the cards.

865
01:26:51,123 --> 01:26:52,784
Wait a second. What happened?

866
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:56,082
Somebody got to you.
Was it Charlie pickett?

867
01:26:57,713 --> 01:27:00,295
Damn it, what did he say?

868
01:27:01,591 --> 01:27:05,550
We can go to jail, be sued,
there's competition clauses.

869
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:07,423
- It's a bluff.
- They got us cold.

870
01:27:07,514 --> 01:27:09,129
They've got nothing, believe me.

871
01:27:13,019 --> 01:27:19,356
My life now revolves around
a paycheck coming in once a week.

872
01:27:20,402 --> 01:27:22,859
I'm not about to put
my wife and kids on the line.

873
01:27:22,904 --> 01:27:25,691
Neither are any
of these other people.

874
01:27:25,741 --> 01:27:31,907
You talk about getting yourself out.
You just dig yourself in deeper. Shit.

875
01:27:33,749 --> 01:27:38,869
I should've just... l was stupid
to get involved with you guys.

876
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:41,036
Just do my job
and get the hell out.

877
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:42,089
Maybe so.

878
01:27:42,174 --> 01:27:44,711
Yeah. Look, if you don't
go for it now, in ten years,

879
01:27:44,801 --> 01:27:47,543
you're gonna
be too old, too scared.

880
01:27:52,768 --> 01:27:54,429
You got out, honcho.

881
01:27:55,604 --> 01:27:57,936
That's something.

882
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:14,236
I'm so...

883
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:19,032
Very sorry.

884
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:27,624
What are you gonna do now?

885
01:28:30,514 --> 01:28:32,800
Kiss Ellison's ass
in the public square.

886
01:28:32,891 --> 01:28:34,427
I'm a genius, remember?

887
01:28:36,812 --> 01:28:39,554
I guess you'll be going home now.

888
01:28:46,112 --> 01:28:48,398
For a while there,
I thought I was home.

889
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:10,584
That is an extremely
amusing story, sir.

890
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:14,012
I don't think I've heard anything
like that in a long time. Here we are.

891
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:18,224
- Nice, huh?
- Nice.

892
01:29:22,941 --> 01:29:24,477
- How are you?
- Great.

893
01:29:24,526 --> 01:29:26,016
(Good.

894
01:29:26,069 --> 01:29:29,687
- Would you have a light on you?
- You bet, Mr. hooker.

895
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:32,530
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

896
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:43,125
They're here! Mr. ebersol
and a whole bunch of other people

897
01:29:43,211 --> 01:29:47,170
going through the warehouse,
coming right this way.

898
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:49,706
What's this all about?
What are they doing here?

899
01:29:49,759 --> 01:29:52,751
I'm supposed to be handling
this company after you've gone.

900
01:29:52,846 --> 01:29:56,054
Watch your step here. It gets
a little slippery on this floor.

901
01:29:57,893 --> 01:30:00,885
We just saw the warehouse,
and it is sensational.

902
01:30:00,937 --> 01:30:03,895
Tremendous output. I want you
to meet Mr. William hooker,

903
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:06,268
the proud owner
of Ellison's new brewery.

904
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:09,146
Hello there, son. How are you?
I've heard a lot about you.

905
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:10,443
You've done a good job.

906
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:14,239
I've always wanted to own
one of these big breweries.

907
01:30:16,119 --> 01:30:19,611
Then congratulations. Let me
be the first one to welcome you

908
01:30:19,706 --> 01:30:21,822
to pisswater beerworks here.

909
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:25,250
I wouldn't drink this garbage
if I was dying of thirst in the desert.

910
01:30:25,295 --> 01:30:30,210
We're up to our necks
in this shit. 1,800 an hour!

911
01:30:31,676 --> 01:30:35,214
You wanna get it up to 2,000?
We got the guys that can do it.

912
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:39,594
How'd you like to be president
of pisswater beerworks?

913
01:30:40,936 --> 01:30:43,678
Old Billy boy needs someone here
who knows what they're doing

914
01:30:43,772 --> 01:30:46,730
'cause god knows, he doesn't
know bullshit about brewing.

915
01:30:46,816 --> 01:30:50,684
Frank's had a few already himself.
Can I talk to you for a second?

916
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:54,488
- Kind of important.
- Don't go away. Be right back.

917
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:57,566
Do you wanna spend the rest
of your life in a trailer? I don't.

918
01:30:57,619 --> 01:30:59,450
I don't know whether
you've lost your mind.

919
01:30:59,537 --> 01:31:02,324
- What's this all about?
- I don't know.

920
01:31:02,415 --> 01:31:05,282
What the hell's
he talking about? Hey, you!

921
01:31:35,281 --> 01:31:38,523
We've had it all redone for you.
You're gonna enjoy this like crazy.

922
01:31:38,618 --> 01:31:41,906
It's right down this way.
Have to get around this thing.

923
01:31:41,997 --> 01:31:43,828
Hey, pal! Hey, no!

924
01:31:44,582 --> 01:31:46,072
Come on, buddy.

925
01:31:58,722 --> 01:32:01,259
Come on, you guys!
Let's get it up to 4,000.

926
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:02,805
We can do it.

927
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:06,469
Get out of the way, will you?
Get out of the way?

928
01:32:10,358 --> 01:32:13,145
Do we know how
to do things around here?

929
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:18,188
- Come on, we can do it!
- What's this all about?

930
01:32:18,283 --> 01:32:20,865
- Ellison sold you out.
- Is that true?

931
01:32:20,952 --> 01:32:22,567
Ask him!

932
01:32:22,662 --> 01:32:24,744
They've gone crazy.
Damn it, turn it off!

933
01:32:26,583 --> 01:32:32,419
- Did Ellison sell me out?
- Yes, you stupid old man.

934
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:39,216
You gotta cut that out.

935
01:32:46,102 --> 01:32:47,888
There's more where that came from!

936
01:32:49,314 --> 01:32:51,555
What are you gonna do?
Do something!

937
01:33:07,916 --> 01:33:11,079
Break it with this. In here.

938
01:33:29,687 --> 01:33:31,973
Are you happy now, frank?

939
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:36,892
Huh? Is this what you wanted?

940
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:40,107
'Cause you could've
had it all, hotshot!

941
01:33:51,042 --> 01:33:54,876
Bottling floor.
Harry "by god" Meade.

942
01:33:58,466 --> 01:34:01,458
Could you hold, please?

943
01:34:05,431 --> 01:34:06,637
Ellison.

944
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:40,505
I understand, Mr. macklin,
that congratulations are in order.

945
01:34:40,592 --> 01:34:45,177
According to Mr. ebersal,
you have done a consummate job.

946
01:34:46,222 --> 01:34:52,639
I think it's fair for you to know
that I personally have chosen you

947
01:34:52,729 --> 01:34:56,267
to head up the entire
Canadian subsidiary network.

948
01:34:57,775 --> 01:35:03,236
I assume that you'll
return here post haste.

949
01:35:10,288 --> 01:35:15,828
I realize it's a big job, the offer
may have rendered you speechless,

950
01:35:15,919 --> 01:35:18,752
but I'm waiting for an answer.

951
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:25,007
You can take your job
and shove it!

952
01:35:29,224 --> 01:35:31,556
What?!

953
01:35:32,769 --> 01:35:35,431
What did he say?

954
01:36:02,257 --> 01:36:03,463
I forgot to tell you.

955
01:36:07,595 --> 01:36:09,711
You're still a snot-nosed kid.

956
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:18,094
Shit.

957
01:36:19,524 --> 01:36:23,858
Y'all wanna bankroll
a hell of a little brewery sometime,

958
01:36:23,945 --> 01:36:25,310
you come back and see us.

959
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:50,585
Screw 'em.
