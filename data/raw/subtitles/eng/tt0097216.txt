Your voice of choice.

94
00:04:35,982 --> 00:04:39,316
The world's only 12-hour
strong man on the air.

95
00:04:39,402 --> 00:04:42,065
Here on WE-LOVE radio, 108 FM.

96
00:04:42,155 --> 00:04:45,398
The last on your dial,
but first in your hearts,

97
00:04:45,492 --> 00:04:47,609
and that's the truth, Ruth.

98
00:04:47,702 --> 00:04:49,193
Here I am. Am I here?

99
00:04:49,287 --> 00:04:51,620
Ya know it. It ya know.

100
00:04:51,706 --> 00:04:53,572
This is Mister Señor Love Daddy

101
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:57,081
doing the nasty to ya ears,
ya ears to the nasty.

102
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,127
I's only play da platters dat matter

103
00:04:59,214 --> 00:05:00,921
the matters dey platter,

104
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:03,590
and that's the truth, Ruth.

105
00:05:05,053 --> 00:05:08,922
<i>From the heart of Bed-Stuy,
you're listening to WE-LOVE radio.</i>

106
00:05:09,015 --> 00:05:11,678
Doing the ying and the yang,
the hip and the hop,

107
00:05:11,768 --> 00:05:14,385
the stupid fresh thing, the flippity-flop.

108
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:20,607
I have today's forecast for you.

109
00:05:21,486 --> 00:05:24,570
Hot! Sss!

110
00:05:24,906 --> 00:05:27,489
The color for today is black.

111
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:28,657
That's right, black.

112
00:05:28,743 --> 00:05:31,907
So you can absorb some of these rays
and save that heat for winter.

113
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:35,161
So you wanna get on out there,
wear that black and be involved.

114
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,163
Also today's temperature's
gonna rise up over 100 degrees.

115
00:05:38,253 --> 00:05:40,119
So that's a Jheri-curl alert.

116
00:05:40,213 --> 00:05:41,545
That's right, Jheri-curl alert.

117
00:05:41,631 --> 00:05:43,067
If you have a Jheri-curl,
stay in the house

118
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:46,209
or you'll end up with a permanent plastic
helmet on your head forever.

119
00:05:46,303 --> 00:05:49,671
<i>All right, we 're going to
say hello to Mister and Missus,</i>

120
00:05:49,764 --> 00:05:51,096
<i>that's Mister and Missus.</i>

121
00:05:51,182 --> 00:05:53,595
<i>And happy birthday to Big Red, Little Red</i>

122
00:05:53,685 --> 00:05:55,722
<i>and Miss Annie Mae, who's 100 today.</i>

123
00:05:55,812 --> 00:05:57,599
<i>If you're careful
and stay out of this heat,</i>

124
00:05:57,689 --> 00:05:59,601
<i>you might live to be that old yourself.</i>

125
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:03,435
<i>There's also a water shortage,
so keep those showers down to one minute.</i>

126
00:06:03,528 --> 00:06:05,736
<i>Two minutes
if you're showering with a friend.</i>

127
00:06:05,822 --> 00:06:08,565
<i>- You better get on out there.</i>
- Oh, damn!

128
00:06:09,492 --> 00:06:10,858
It is hot!

129
00:06:10,952 --> 00:06:12,238
<i>You'll get that pink slip.</i>

130
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:14,821
<i>So get up, get up, get up
and get on out there!</i>

131
00:06:14,915 --> 00:06:16,058
<i>That's what I'm talking about.</i>

132
00:06:16,082 --> 00:06:18,324
<i>We don't want to see
anybody losing their jobs</i>

133
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:20,284
<i>'cause ain't nobody got no money as it is.</i>

134
00:06:23,298 --> 00:06:25,335
<i>All right.
Now we 're going to talk about it.</i>

135
00:06:25,425 --> 00:06:27,737
<i>The streets are coming alive.
We 're going to rock 'n' roll...</i>

136
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:30,048
Good m-m-morning.

137
00:06:30,138 --> 00:06:33,381
M-M-My name is Smiley.

138
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:39,141
This is M-M-M-M-Malcolm... X.

139
00:06:40,357 --> 00:06:45,398
And this is M-M-M-M-Martin K-K-King.

140
00:06:45,987 --> 00:06:50,152
Now, th-they are d-d-dead.

141
00:06:53,244 --> 00:07:00,083
But w-we still h-h-have to f-f-f-fight

142
00:07:00,168 --> 00:07:04,287
a-against ap-apartheid.

143
00:07:04,381 --> 00:07:10,548
10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100.

144
00:07:10,637 --> 00:07:13,129
20, 40, 60, shit!

145
00:07:13,223 --> 00:07:18,093
80... 300.

146
00:07:18,186 --> 00:07:23,102
20, 40, 60, 80... Wait, that's 300.

147
00:07:23,191 --> 00:07:29,108
300, 350, 450... cash dollar bills.

148
00:07:48,258 --> 00:07:51,547
Mookie. Why are you always
bothering me when I'm sleeping...

149
00:07:51,636 --> 00:07:53,377
Wake up, wake up.

150
00:07:53,471 --> 00:07:55,053
Stop breathing down my neck!

151
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,927
Why should I wake up, Mookie?

152
00:07:57,017 --> 00:07:59,384
It's gonna be hot today, Jade.

153
00:07:59,477 --> 00:08:02,686
Saturday's the only day
I get to sleep late.

154
00:08:02,772 --> 00:08:05,606
Damn.

155
00:08:07,068 --> 00:08:09,310
Stop, Mookie. That's not funny.

156
00:08:09,404 --> 00:08:11,646
Why don't you leave me alone
when I'm sleeping?

157
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,968
What's the matter? You don't love
your brother Mookie anymore?

158
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:15,278
I loves you, Jade.

159
00:08:15,368 --> 00:08:18,736
I'll get a lock
and keep your ass out of here, Mookie.

160
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:23,416
Why don't you go to work, man,
and leave me alone for once?

161
00:08:23,501 --> 00:08:25,242
Later. Got to get paid.

162
00:08:25,336 --> 00:08:26,452
Yeah, brush your teeth.

163
00:08:26,546 --> 00:08:28,287
I brushed my teeth.

164
00:08:28,381 --> 00:08:29,963
Your breath stinks.

165
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,050
It's your upper lip.

166
00:08:31,134 --> 00:08:34,377
What's up, there, Sal?
How you doin' there, boy?

167
00:08:34,471 --> 00:08:36,463
Man, I got to get me a Cadillac like that.

168
00:08:36,556 --> 00:08:41,017
I'm gonna get me a car just like that.
Big old Cadillac.

169
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:45,805
Oh, it's hot.

170
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,897
Sonny, how's the vegetables, huh?

171
00:08:50,987 --> 00:08:53,604
Good morning, Sal, Pino, Vito.

172
00:08:53,698 --> 00:08:55,360
Pop, you talk to that air-condition guy?

173
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,032
I been calling him all week.

174
00:08:57,118 --> 00:08:59,485
He won't come around
unless he has a police escort.

175
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,283
Pino, get a broom and sweep up front.

176
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:11,084
Vito, get a broom and sweep out front.

177
00:09:11,174 --> 00:09:13,006
- Huh?
- Get a broom and sweep out front.

178
00:09:13,093 --> 00:09:14,093
What?

179
00:09:14,552 --> 00:09:17,260
Get a broom and sweep out front!

180
00:09:17,347 --> 00:09:19,179
See, Pop?
It's just what I was telling you.

181
00:09:19,265 --> 00:09:21,257
Every time you tell Pino what to do,

182
00:09:21,351 --> 00:09:23,434
he tells me to do
what you told him what to do.

183
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,136
He's brain-dead, Pop, for years.

184
00:09:26,189 --> 00:09:28,727
- Both of you, shut up.
- Tell Pino!

185
00:09:28,817 --> 00:09:31,128
What, am I talking to myself, here?
Is that what I'm doing?

186
00:09:31,152 --> 00:09:32,939
I didn't want to come to work anyway.

187
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:36,272
I hate this friggin' place.
I detest it like a sickness.

188
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,823
You-You detest this place like a sickness?

189
00:09:42,372 --> 00:09:44,864
That's, like, really hate, you know?
That's hate.

190
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:48,329
- I didn't say that.
- Oh, you didn't say that?

191
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:50,911
What, I just heard it. Am I going crazy?

192
00:09:51,005 --> 00:09:52,997
Did I just hear that, Vito?

193
00:09:53,091 --> 00:09:56,550
I mean, do you think you can do better?

194
00:09:56,636 --> 00:09:58,252
No, I didn't think so.

195
00:09:58,346 --> 00:10:00,884
You see, Pino,
this is a respectable business,

196
00:10:00,974 --> 00:10:02,465
and there's nothing wrong with that.

197
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:04,662
If there's something wrong with that,
I want you to tell me.

198
00:10:04,686 --> 00:10:07,053
You... No, you can tell me right now.

199
00:10:07,147 --> 00:10:08,457
- Is there something wrong with that?
- No.

200
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:10,084
All right. There's nothing wrong.
All right? Okay?

201
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:11,599
Look, do me a favor.

202
00:10:11,693 --> 00:10:14,026
- Get a broom and sweep up.
- Tell Vito.

203
00:10:14,112 --> 00:10:16,695
What are you, deaf or what? Pop asked you.

204
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:18,693
I'm going to kill somebody today.

205
00:10:24,455 --> 00:10:26,433
- I can't believe it, you know?
- What?

206
00:10:26,457 --> 00:10:27,493
That you like her.

207
00:10:27,584 --> 00:10:29,041
- I don't like her.
- Yeah?

208
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:30,538
Yeah, I don't like her.

209
00:10:40,096 --> 00:10:41,212
Hell no.

210
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:45,799
- Hey.
- Hi, Mookie.

211
00:10:45,894 --> 00:10:47,226
Mookie.

212
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:48,393
Hey, Mook.

213
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:54,312
Mornin', Mookie.

214
00:10:54,402 --> 00:10:55,643
Morning, Miss Mother Sister.

215
00:10:55,737 --> 00:10:57,353
Now Mookie, don't work too hard today.

216
00:10:57,447 --> 00:10:59,439
The man says it's going to be hot
as the devil.

217
00:10:59,532 --> 00:11:02,400
I don't want you falling out
from the heat, you hear me, son?

218
00:11:02,535 --> 00:11:05,152
- I hear you, Mother Sister. I hear you.
- Good.

219
00:11:05,246 --> 00:11:07,238
- All right.
- I'll be watching you, son.

220
00:11:08,082 --> 00:11:11,200
Mother Sister always watches.

221
00:11:15,256 --> 00:11:16,872
Mookie...

222
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:19,750
You're late again.

223
00:11:20,553 --> 00:11:23,136
You live up the block, what?
Your Cadillac broke?

224
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:25,843
Hello, Sal, Vito.

225
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:27,095
Yo, Mook. What up?

226
00:11:27,185 --> 00:11:28,185
Just coolin'.

227
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:30,386
Just coolin'. You're still late.

228
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,393
Why don't you Relax, Pino?
Take it easy. You'll live longer.

229
00:11:33,483 --> 00:11:35,323
Here, take the broom.
The front needs sweeping.

230
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:36,767
Wait a minute. I just got here.

231
00:11:36,861 --> 00:11:38,853
You sweep.
I bet you Sal asked you first anyway.

232
00:11:38,947 --> 00:11:40,028
That's right.

233
00:11:40,114 --> 00:11:41,480
Vito, stop that.

234
00:11:42,075 --> 00:11:44,067
You know, just fuck that shit.
I deliver pizzas.

235
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,868
- That's what I get paid for.
- You get paid to do what we say.

236
00:11:46,955 --> 00:11:50,073
What we say? Did you hear Sal?
I didn't hear Sal say nothing.

237
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,333
- Who's working for who, huh?
- Shh.

238
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:56,336
Come on in, Mayor.

239
00:11:59,175 --> 00:12:00,541
Morning, gentlemen.

240
00:12:00,635 --> 00:12:03,594
Pino, Mookie, Vito, Sal.

241
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,093
- How are you?
- Ooh-whee.

242
00:12:06,182 --> 00:12:09,926
It's gonna be a scorcher today.
That's for sure.

243
00:12:10,436 --> 00:12:12,519
Need any work done 'round here?

244
00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:17,066
Daddy...

245
00:12:17,151 --> 00:12:19,108
Why don't you leave him alone? Huh?

246
00:12:20,071 --> 00:12:21,528
He's a good man. Leave him alone.

247
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:24,114
Choose your weapon, Mayor.

248
00:12:27,662 --> 00:12:28,823
You dropped something, Mayor.

249
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,868
You are going to have
the cleanest sidewalk in Brooklyn.

250
00:12:35,962 --> 00:12:38,796
Clean as the Board of Health. Ha!

251
00:12:38,881 --> 00:12:40,873
All right, Mayor.

252
00:12:41,884 --> 00:12:43,375
Pop, I don't believe this shit.

253
00:12:43,469 --> 00:12:45,176
You running welfare or something?

254
00:12:45,263 --> 00:12:47,721
Every day you give this <i>azupep</i> a dollar.

255
00:12:47,807 --> 00:12:50,619
- What's <i>azupep?</i> What's this <i>azupep</i> shit?
- Are you Italian? Do you know <i>azupep</i>?

256
00:12:50,643 --> 00:12:52,555
The Mayor ain't no <i>azupep.</i>

257
00:12:52,645 --> 00:12:55,245
Every day you give this <i>azupep</i> a dollar
for sweeping our sidewalk.

258
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,682
What do we pay Mookie for, huh?
He don't even work.

259
00:12:58,776 --> 00:13:00,768
I work harder than him,
and I'm your own son.

260
00:13:00,862 --> 00:13:04,446
Pino, let's see you carry
six large pies up six flights of stairs,

261
00:13:04,532 --> 00:13:06,068
no elevator either and shit.

262
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:08,651
- Why don't you both shut up?
- Yeah, tell 'em, Pop.

263
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:11,491
And why don't you shut up, too, Vito?

264
00:13:11,581 --> 00:13:13,698
- Me and you are gonna have a talk.
- Aw, says who?

265
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:14,827
- Says who?
- Says who?

266
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:16,158
- Says me.
- Who are you?

267
00:13:16,252 --> 00:13:18,619
Hey, hey! Now what did I just say?

268
00:13:18,713 --> 00:13:21,205
Don't start that
"Mookie don't work" shit, all right?

269
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:22,961
- Yo, Ahmad!
- I coulda done that.

270
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:25,885
Man, shut up. Yo, Ahmad!

271
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,383
Shit. Look, stop.

272
00:13:28,473 --> 00:13:30,576
Look, Punchy, you want to do
any more screaming, be my guest.

273
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,432
'Cause I'm too through.

274
00:13:32,518 --> 00:13:34,100
Yo, who's out here yelling my name?

275
00:13:35,688 --> 00:13:37,791
- Well, Punchy told me to.
- Punchy told me to.

276
00:13:37,815 --> 00:13:40,683
Don't listen to this knothead.
It'll get you in trouble, girl.

277
00:13:40,777 --> 00:13:41,777
Heard that, Punchy.

278
00:13:41,861 --> 00:13:44,023
- Yo, Ella? Ella?
- What?

279
00:13:44,113 --> 00:13:46,150
You got a brain, right? Use it.

280
00:13:48,451 --> 00:13:49,451
Peace, y'all.

281
00:13:49,452 --> 00:13:51,739
- Peace, Radio Raheem.
- Peace, man.

282
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:53,616
You the man. I'm just visiting.

283
00:13:53,706 --> 00:13:57,996
- It's your world, G.
- For real, in a big motherfuckin' way.

284
00:13:58,086 --> 00:13:59,827
Yo, that boy's livin' very large.

285
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:01,913
Even walks in stereo.

286
00:14:02,924 --> 00:14:05,166
Yo, P.E.'s in full effect, boy!

287
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:07,797
Radio Raheem like a motherfucker.

288
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:12,889
Radio Raheem. Blastin' that big box.

289
00:14:12,975 --> 00:14:14,637
Cold rockin' the scene.

290
00:14:18,106 --> 00:14:19,938
Where's the Miller High Life?

291
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:22,436
Where is the Miller High Life?

292
00:14:22,527 --> 00:14:25,019
No more High Life.
You look what we have and buy.

293
00:14:25,113 --> 00:14:26,399
No more High Life?

294
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,651
What kind of a joint is this?

295
00:14:28,741 --> 00:14:30,403
How come no more High Life?

296
00:14:30,493 --> 00:14:33,907
Look, doctor, this ain't Korea or China
or wherever you come from.

297
00:14:33,996 --> 00:14:36,830
You get some Miller High Life
in this fuckin' joint.

298
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:37,916
You buy another beer.

299
00:14:39,794 --> 00:14:40,830
Da Mayor...

300
00:14:42,213 --> 00:14:44,580
don't drink this Lite shit.

301
00:14:44,674 --> 00:14:47,007
Tastes like cold pot liquor.

302
00:14:47,885 --> 00:14:51,674
All right, all right.
But you're askin' a lot

303
00:14:51,764 --> 00:14:53,130
to make a man change his beer.

304
00:14:53,224 --> 00:14:54,886
You askin' lot, doctor.

305
00:14:59,355 --> 00:15:01,187
Hey! You old drunk!

306
00:15:01,774 --> 00:15:04,266
What did I tell you about drinkin'
in front of my stoop?

307
00:15:04,861 --> 00:15:06,818
Move on. You're blockin' my view.

308
00:15:09,282 --> 00:15:12,946
You are ugly enough. Don't stare at me.

309
00:15:13,035 --> 00:15:14,822
The evil eye doesn't work on me.

310
00:15:14,912 --> 00:15:18,701
Mother Sister,
you been talkin' about me for 18 years.

311
00:15:19,834 --> 00:15:21,746
- What I ever done to you?
- You a drunk fool.

312
00:15:21,836 --> 00:15:22,872
Besides that?

313
00:15:23,671 --> 00:15:25,503
The Mayor don't bother nobody,

314
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,707
And nobody don't bother the Mayor but you.

315
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:32,340
The Mayor just tend to his own business.
I love everybody.

316
00:15:32,722 --> 00:15:35,009
- I even love you.
- Hold your tongue!

317
00:15:35,099 --> 00:15:36,965
You don't have that much love.

318
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:40,177
One day, you gonna be nice to me.

319
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,598
We may both be dead and buried,
but you gonna be nice.

320
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:46,475
At least civil.

321
00:15:56,496 --> 00:15:59,409
I told you.
I'm not going to babysit for you,

322
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:00,740
and that's it!

323
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,244
What are you talking about?

324
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:04,247
Yesterday you said you were gonna do it.

325
00:16:04,337 --> 00:16:05,777
Now today you're changing your mind?

326
00:16:05,838 --> 00:16:09,252
No, I'm not changing...

327
00:16:09,342 --> 00:16:11,254
Get off of me, Mami, please!

328
00:16:11,344 --> 00:16:14,758
It's, like, I do everything for you,
but you can't do shit for me!

329
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,089
Yeah, right.

330
00:16:17,183 --> 00:16:19,846
Right, Mami. No, it's not like that, Mami.

331
00:16:19,936 --> 00:16:23,850
Uh-huh. I can do everything for you, Mami,
but you won't do shit for me, right?

332
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:26,685
Stop it!

333
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:31,274
That lady makes me sick!

334
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:39,077
Your father makes me sick, too.
Everybody makes me sick.

335
00:16:39,872 --> 00:16:40,988
Shit.

336
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,666
Your father ain't no real father.
He's a bum.

337
00:16:45,753 --> 00:16:50,794
Chump change, to-the-curb,
pulling no major pub, bum!

338
00:16:51,717 --> 00:16:52,798
Mike.

339
00:16:52,885 --> 00:16:55,047
Fuck Mike Tyson! Mike Tyson ain't shit.

340
00:16:55,137 --> 00:16:57,880
I remember when he mugged that woman
right there on Lexington.

341
00:16:57,974 --> 00:16:59,868
- I remember that shit.
- And you're going to tell him that?

342
00:16:59,892 --> 00:17:01,804
I'll tell him that. I ain't...
Fuck Mike Tyson!

343
00:17:01,894 --> 00:17:03,806
- To his face?
- You goddamn right!

344
00:17:03,896 --> 00:17:05,888
Mike Tyson will knock
your goddamn eye out.

345
00:17:05,982 --> 00:17:07,876
- I ain't scared of Mike Tyson.
- You talk shit now.

346
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,836
- I'll drop him like a bad habit.
- ML, you hear that?

347
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,726
- Yeah, sure. Go ahead.
- Yeah, boy.

348
00:17:11,821 --> 00:17:14,985
If Tyson dream about whippin' my ass,
he better wake up and apologize.

349
00:17:15,074 --> 00:17:16,906
Well, gentlemen, the way I see it...

350
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:22,079
if this hot weather continues,
it's going to melt the polar caps

351
00:17:22,164 --> 00:17:24,998
and the whole wide world.

352
00:17:25,084 --> 00:17:27,997
And all those parts
that ain't water already

353
00:17:28,087 --> 00:17:30,044
will surely be flooded.

354
00:17:30,131 --> 00:17:32,748
You dumb ass, simple motherfucker!

355
00:17:32,842 --> 00:17:34,674
Now, where you read that shit, eh?

356
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,046
The polar caps.

357
00:17:36,137 --> 00:17:38,254
- Oh.
- Don't worry about it.

358
00:17:38,347 --> 00:17:41,055
And when it happens, and I'm in my boat,

359
00:17:41,142 --> 00:17:43,054
and you black asses are drowning,

360
00:17:43,144 --> 00:17:45,727
don't call for me to throw you no rope,

361
00:17:45,813 --> 00:17:49,102
- no lifesaver, or no nothing.
- No nothing.

362
00:17:49,191 --> 00:17:51,524
You fool, you 30 cent away from a quarter.

363
00:17:51,611 --> 00:17:54,069
How the fuck you gonna get a boat?

364
00:17:54,155 --> 00:17:55,316
Hey, yeah, boy.

365
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:56,863
Don't worry about it.

366
00:17:57,533 --> 00:17:59,115
Goddamn right, don't worry about it.

367
00:17:59,201 --> 00:18:00,863
Look at you. You're raggedy as a roach,

368
00:18:00,953 --> 00:18:02,785
eat the holes out of doughnuts.

369
00:18:02,872 --> 00:18:04,408
Raggedy motherfucker!

370
00:18:04,498 --> 00:18:07,206
- Shit, don't worry about it.
- I'm in good shape, eh?

371
00:18:07,293 --> 00:18:08,875
I'm in good shape.

372
00:18:08,961 --> 00:18:11,624
I'll be back on my feet soon enough.

373
00:18:11,714 --> 00:18:14,206
Not in them raggedy-ass shoes!
Look at you.

374
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,667
Shoes so run over,
he gotta lay down to put 'em on.

375
00:18:18,512 --> 00:18:21,129
- So, ML, ML, ML, tell me.
- Mm-hmm.

376
00:18:21,223 --> 00:18:23,761
So when is all this goddamn ice
supposed to melt?

377
00:18:25,102 --> 00:18:26,718
Hello. Sal's Pizza.

378
00:18:26,812 --> 00:18:28,519
Yep.

379
00:18:28,606 --> 00:18:30,347
Meatball hero, eggplant Parmesan.

380
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:31,682
You got it.

381
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,779
Yeah, we deliver. Of course, we deliver.

382
00:18:37,865 --> 00:18:40,448
All right. Where is that?

383
00:18:40,534 --> 00:18:42,776
You gonna pay now
or you gonna pay on layaway?

384
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,906
How much?

385
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:47,246
You been coming here at least
three times a day.

386
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,494
What are you, a retard?

387
00:18:49,126 --> 00:18:50,412
It's $1.50.

388
00:18:50,503 --> 00:18:52,745
Yo Sal, put some cheese
on that motherfucker, man.

389
00:18:52,838 --> 00:18:54,579
Extra cheese is $2.00.

390
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:57,044
- $2.00?
- Yeah, $2.00.

391
00:18:57,134 --> 00:18:58,591
Hey, you can forget that shit.

392
00:18:58,678 --> 00:18:59,678
Yeah.

393
00:19:10,022 --> 00:19:11,022
What...

394
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:14,520
Damn, Sal, you're cheap, man.

395
00:19:25,037 --> 00:19:26,949
...right, and he called him a bum.

396
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,759
- A bum?
- I don't think he was a bum.

397
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,783
He just wasn't right,
and he wasn't compassionate.

398
00:19:30,876 --> 00:19:32,813
- As Sal would say...
- I need passion in my life.

399
00:19:32,837 --> 00:19:34,373
As Sal would say, he's a <i>mamaluke.</i>

400
00:19:34,463 --> 00:19:35,954
He's a <i>mamaluke!</i>

401
00:19:37,174 --> 00:19:38,506
Yeah, right.

402
00:19:38,592 --> 00:19:39,628
Yo, Mook!

403
00:19:41,595 --> 00:19:43,461
- Mookie!
- What?

404
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:45,343
How come you got
no brothers up on the wall?

405
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,432
Man, ask Sal, all right?

406
00:19:47,518 --> 00:19:49,538
Hey, Sal, how come you got
no brothers up on the wall here?

407
00:19:49,562 --> 00:19:51,599
You want brothers on the wall?
Get your own place.

408
00:19:51,689 --> 00:19:53,271
You can do what you wanna do.

409
00:19:53,357 --> 00:19:56,316
You can put your brothers and uncles,
nieces and nephews,

410
00:19:56,402 --> 00:19:59,520
your stepfather, stepmother,
whoever you want, you see?

411
00:19:59,613 --> 00:20:01,479
But this is my pizzeria.

412
00:20:02,158 --> 00:20:04,366
American-Italians on the wall only.

413
00:20:04,452 --> 00:20:05,762
- Take it easy, Pop.
- And you...

414
00:20:05,786 --> 00:20:07,948
Hey, don't start with me today.

415
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:09,038
What?

416
00:20:09,832 --> 00:20:13,200
Yeah, that might be fine, Sal,
but you own this.

417
00:20:13,502 --> 00:20:16,666
Rarely do I see
any American-Italians eating in here.

418
00:20:16,756 --> 00:20:18,213
All I see is black folks.

419
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:21,883
So since we spend much money here,
we do have some say.

420
00:20:21,969 --> 00:20:22,969
Boop.

421
00:20:26,932 --> 00:20:27,932
You lookin' for trouble?

422
00:20:28,517 --> 00:20:30,634
Are you a troublemaker?
Is that what you are?

423
00:20:31,187 --> 00:20:33,107
- You making trouble?
- Yeah, I'm a troublemaker.

424
00:20:33,189 --> 00:20:34,225
I'm making trouble.

425
00:20:34,315 --> 00:20:35,772
You're a real ball-breaker.

426
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,768
Relax. You're always coming in here
looking for trouble, aren't you?

427
00:20:39,862 --> 00:20:41,899
Suppose I busted your head.
How would you...

428
00:20:44,366 --> 00:20:47,450
Oh, Mookie, you want to get
your friend out of here?

429
00:20:47,536 --> 00:20:49,869
What, you gonna kick me out now?
You gonna kick me out?

430
00:20:49,955 --> 00:20:52,197
No, I'm not kicking you out.
You're kicking yourself out.

431
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,060
What? Look, we want some brothers
up on the wall...

432
00:20:54,084 --> 00:20:57,668
You know, Malcolm X, Nelson Mandela,
you know, Michael Jordan!

433
00:20:57,755 --> 00:20:58,755
Tomorrow!

434
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:00,439
Come on, Mookie. Get him out. All right?

435
00:21:00,508 --> 00:21:02,360
- I'm trying to get him out!
- Yo, I paid for this.

436
00:21:02,384 --> 00:21:04,501
Take your slice.
I know you paid for it. Let's go.

437
00:21:04,595 --> 00:21:06,490
Yeah, all right, you're kicking me out.
Gonna beat me in the head.

438
00:21:06,514 --> 00:21:07,908
- Gonna kick me out.
- Come on. Let's go.

439
00:21:07,932 --> 00:21:09,932
Yeah, okay. Yeah, all right.
Look, I paid for my...

440
00:21:10,017 --> 00:21:12,885
- Look, boycott Sal's! Boycott Sal's.
- Go!

441
00:21:12,978 --> 00:21:14,594
I got your boycott swinging.

442
00:21:14,688 --> 00:21:15,688
Boycott Sal's.

443
00:21:15,689 --> 00:21:17,681
Yo, I paid... What you laughin' at?

444
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:20,483
Mookie, I paid for my slice, man.

445
00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:22,435
Yo, man, come on.
I spend much money in there!

446
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,257
- What are you trying to do?
- What am I trying to do?

447
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:26,259
- What are you trying to do?
- I want brothers up on the wall.

448
00:21:26,283 --> 00:21:28,303
I gotta work here, man.
You're fucking my shit up, man.

449
00:21:28,327 --> 00:21:29,721
And this is between me and Sal, man.

450
00:21:29,745 --> 00:21:32,140
- You're fucking me up.
- I ain't trying to fuck you up, Mook.

451
00:21:32,164 --> 00:21:34,121
You know, I ain't trying to fuck you.
I'm sorry.

452
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,449
You're sorry?

453
00:21:35,543 --> 00:21:38,160
Look, come back in a week,
it'll be squashed, all right?

454
00:21:38,254 --> 00:21:39,745
- A week?
- A week.

455
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,090
- Yeah. Yeah.
- All right?

456
00:21:42,174 --> 00:21:43,091
- Bet. Bet.
- Bet.

457
00:21:43,092 --> 00:21:44,958
Pizza.

458
00:21:45,678 --> 00:21:47,089
Mook...

459
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:48,386
Stay black!

460
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:53,286
I mean, this guy's your friend, right?

461
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,205
If I'm wrong, tell me I'm wrong.
Is he your friend?

462
00:21:55,229 --> 00:21:56,915
- He's my friend.
- Okay, if he don't behave,

463
00:21:56,939 --> 00:21:59,352
I don't want him in here anymore.
He's out.

464
00:21:59,441 --> 00:22:01,057
I can't do nothing with him, Sal.

465
00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:03,484
- You talk some brother talk to him.
- Brother talk?

466
00:22:04,405 --> 00:22:06,988
Look, people are free to do
the hell whatever they want to do.

467
00:22:07,074 --> 00:22:09,532
What free?
What the hell are you talking about? Free?

468
00:22:09,618 --> 00:22:11,826
Free? There's no free here.

469
00:22:11,912 --> 00:22:13,028
I'm the boss.

470
00:22:13,122 --> 00:22:14,909
No freedom. I'm the boss.

471
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:17,161
You want freedom? There, that's free.

472
00:22:17,251 --> 00:22:20,021
You take an order, and you take it out.
He's got an order there for you.

473
00:22:20,045 --> 00:22:22,833
Come on, let's go, move.
Come on! Let's go to work here!

474
00:22:22,923 --> 00:22:24,860
- What are you laughing at?
- You're standing here doing nothing.

475
00:22:24,884 --> 00:22:26,876
Him... You're afraid of the goddamn oven.

476
00:22:26,969 --> 00:22:28,449
- Hit the oven!
- Is this the address?

477
00:22:28,512 --> 00:22:30,219
That's the address. "Is that the address?"

478
00:22:30,306 --> 00:22:32,764
Is that what he just asked me?
Is that the address?

479
00:22:40,232 --> 00:22:41,518
Mookie.

480
00:22:42,818 --> 00:22:44,150
Come here, doctor.

481
00:22:45,404 --> 00:22:47,987
- Mayor, I got to go. I'm working.
- Come here, doctor.

482
00:22:48,073 --> 00:22:49,689
This is the Mayor talking.

483
00:22:49,783 --> 00:22:50,742
All right. All right.

484
00:22:50,743 --> 00:22:52,700
- Doctor?
- Come on, what? What?

485
00:22:52,786 --> 00:22:53,947
Always do the right thing.

486
00:22:55,831 --> 00:22:56,912
- That's it?
- That's it.

487
00:22:56,999 --> 00:22:58,740
I got it. I'm gone.

488
00:23:03,756 --> 00:23:05,918
M-M-Mookie...

489
00:23:06,008 --> 00:23:07,169
How you doin', Smiley?

490
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:08,375
P-P-Pay...

491
00:23:08,469 --> 00:23:11,428
- t-two d-d-dollars.
- The other one, the other one.

492
00:23:11,513 --> 00:23:14,847
- T-Two d-d-dollars.
- The other one, Smiley.

493
00:23:14,934 --> 00:23:17,176
One-One d-dollar.

494
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:19,386
That one. Tonight, when I get paid.

495
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,769
When... When you get p-p...

496
00:23:22,858 --> 00:23:27,102
- Bye, M-Mookie.
- Bye, Smiley!

497
00:23:27,196 --> 00:23:28,196
M-M-M-M-Malcolm.

498
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,192
M-M-M-M-Martin.

499
00:23:30,282 --> 00:23:32,274
M-M-M-M-Martin.

500
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,073
Shit.

501
00:23:40,668 --> 00:23:42,625
Seen your brother this morning.

502
00:23:42,711 --> 00:23:44,418
Yeah, on his way to work, I hope.

503
00:23:47,257 --> 00:23:49,419
This might take a little bit of time,
Mother Sister.

504
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,843
I got nowhere to go.

505
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:54,387
We haven't had a good sit-down
for a long while.

506
00:23:54,473 --> 00:23:55,473
Mm.

507
00:23:56,767 --> 00:24:00,226
Tender-headed runs in my family.
Are you tender-headed?

508
00:24:00,312 --> 00:24:01,393
Yeah. Me, too.

509
00:24:02,231 --> 00:24:05,770
I don't fool with it.
That's why only you can touch it.

510
00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:06,859
Ouch!

511
00:24:06,944 --> 00:24:09,061
I'm sorry, Mother Sister.
The comb got caught.

512
00:24:09,154 --> 00:24:11,897
Be gentle, child.
Mother Sister's an old woman.

513
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:12,991
Yes, Mother Sister.

514
00:24:13,075 --> 00:24:15,863
Ooh-whee!

515
00:24:15,953 --> 00:24:18,286
I didn't know you had such beautiful hair.

516
00:24:18,372 --> 00:24:20,455
Fool, there's a lot in this world
you don't know.

517
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:23,204
I'm not stopping.
I'm on my way.

518
00:24:29,341 --> 00:24:31,549
Mother Sister,
why are you so cruel to Da Mayor?

519
00:24:31,635 --> 00:24:32,842
It isn't right.

520
00:24:32,928 --> 00:24:34,288
I ain't studying no Mayor.

521
00:24:34,346 --> 00:24:36,463
He reminds me
of my least favorite peoples,

522
00:24:36,557 --> 00:24:38,594
my tenant and my ex-husband.

523
00:24:38,684 --> 00:24:41,427
Goddamn! Bless his soul.

524
00:24:43,856 --> 00:24:45,597

Oh, my God!

563
00:26:54,236 --> 00:26:55,236
Did you see that, man?

564
00:27:10,294 --> 00:27:11,410
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

565
00:27:11,503 --> 00:27:13,870
It's Radio. Radio, man.

566
00:27:13,964 --> 00:27:15,375
Hey, what's up, Radio?

567
00:27:15,465 --> 00:27:16,424
What's up Radio?

568
00:27:28,228 --> 00:27:29,890
Don't! Stop! Stop!

569
00:27:38,488 --> 00:27:41,981
Yo! Don't be fucking with the water now.

570
00:27:42,075 --> 00:27:44,158
Oh, man, go ahead, man.
Go ahead, you got it!

571
00:27:44,244 --> 00:27:46,452
There's going to be
a lot of fucking trouble

572
00:27:46,538 --> 00:27:47,699
if you get this car wet.

573
00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:49,906
Ain't nobody fucking around, man.

574
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,241
Why don't you just go ahead?

575
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:53,327
This is an antique there, hotshot.

576
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,082
Man, go ahead! It's a what?

577
00:27:55,172 --> 00:27:57,004
Hey, man, I'm... I'm serious, man!

578
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,207
All right. Okay, you won't get wet, man.

579
00:27:59,301 --> 00:28:00,633
Yeah, well, make sure I don't.

580
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:01,946
- Go ahead!
- You're not gonna...

581
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,448
- Just hurry up, man. Damn.
- Drive the car!

582
00:28:03,472 --> 00:28:04,553
All right, I'm driving it.

583
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,784
You ain't got no business
in this neighborhood, anyway!

584
00:28:07,893 --> 00:28:09,829
- Get out! Get out, motherfucker!
- Come on, let's go!

585
00:28:09,853 --> 00:28:12,516
- Hey, fuck you back!
- Turn the fucking water. Turn the water!

586
00:28:21,573 --> 00:28:22,689
Go!

587
00:28:23,784 --> 00:28:25,491
Those son of a bitches!

588
00:28:25,577 --> 00:28:27,739
They got me fucking soaked!

589
00:28:27,829 --> 00:28:30,196
Officer! Officer, wait a minute. Hold it!

590
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:32,373
I want an arrest made right now!

591
00:28:32,459 --> 00:28:33,728
- Right now!
- What's the matter?

592
00:28:33,752 --> 00:28:34,812
- I'm fuckin' soaked!
- Calm down.

593
00:28:34,836 --> 00:28:36,773
Would you please calm down, sir?
Tell us what happened.

594
00:28:36,797 --> 00:28:39,210
Two black kids,
they soaked me with the fire hydrant.

595
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:41,586
They ruined my car! Look!
This is an antique!

596
00:28:41,677 --> 00:28:43,637
- They got me fuckin' soaked!
- So where are they?

597
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,716
Where are they?
Brilliant fucking question!

598
00:28:45,806 --> 00:28:47,116
- Where are they?
- They ran away!

599
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,301
Where do you think they are?

600
00:28:48,392 --> 00:28:51,352
- Do you wish to file a complaint, sir?
- Yeah, I want to file a complaint.

601
00:28:51,436 --> 00:28:53,473
I want 'em locked under the fucking jail.

602
00:28:53,563 --> 00:28:55,166
Hey, Marco,
I'm gonna turn off the water, okay?

603
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,523
- Yeah.
- Where you going? Where's he going?

604
00:28:57,609 --> 00:28:59,379
Did you happen to catch the name
of the suspect, sir?

605
00:28:59,403 --> 00:29:02,271
Officer, what the fuck are you doing?

606
00:29:02,364 --> 00:29:03,508
- Fuck that hydrant.
- Just calm down.

607
00:29:03,532 --> 00:29:05,426
- Calm down, my ass!
- Did you happen to catch the name?

608
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,450
Fuck you, their names!

609
00:29:06,535 --> 00:29:08,242
Moe and Joe! What do I know their names?

610
00:29:08,328 --> 00:29:09,444
Moe and Joe what, sir?

611
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:12,656
Moe and Joe what? Moe and Joe what?

612
00:29:12,749 --> 00:29:15,162
Moe and Joe Black. How's that?

613
00:29:15,252 --> 00:29:16,288
They're brothers, sir?

614
00:29:16,378 --> 00:29:18,231
Yeah, they're brothers.
Yeah, they're fucking brothers.

615
00:29:18,255 --> 00:29:21,214
This hydrant
better not come back on again,

616
00:29:22,009 --> 00:29:23,591
or there's going to be hell to pay!

617
00:29:23,677 --> 00:29:25,669
Come answer to me, goddamn it!

618
00:29:25,762 --> 00:29:27,378
Ask him. He knows.

619
00:29:27,472 --> 00:29:29,464
He's a witness.
He saw the whole fucking thing!

620
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:31,265
Go on, man. Tell him what happened.

621
00:29:31,351 --> 00:29:32,991
Would you let us do the questioning, sir?

622
00:29:34,646 --> 00:29:35,932
Fucking bullshit.

623
00:29:36,023 --> 00:29:38,606
- You know anything about this?
- Who were the punks?

624
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:44,363
Doctors, those that'll tell don't know,

625
00:29:44,448 --> 00:29:47,737
and those that know won't tell.

626
00:29:48,243 --> 00:29:51,657
- What the fuck is that? Voodoo shit?
- Wise guy.

627
00:29:51,747 --> 00:29:54,740
Hey, Mayor don't know nothin', all right?

628
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:57,700
Hey! He's leaving?

629
00:29:57,794 --> 00:29:59,001
Keep this hydrant off. Huh?

630
00:29:59,087 --> 00:30:00,578
You wanna swim? Go to Coney Island.

631
00:30:00,672 --> 00:30:03,335
Ho, I'm talking to you!
He's leaving? What about me?

632
00:30:03,425 --> 00:30:06,293
- What about you?
- I suggest you get to your car quick,

633
00:30:06,386 --> 00:30:08,548
before these people start
to strip it clean.

634
00:30:08,638 --> 00:30:10,345
Have a nice day, sir.

635
00:30:16,021 --> 00:30:17,978
He left there about a half hour ago?

636
00:30:18,065 --> 00:30:21,308
No, no problem. Thank you.
Yeah, half hour, right.

637
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:23,643
Mookie left...
Where the hell you been, Mookie?

638
00:30:23,737 --> 00:30:25,774
I got a business to run, okay?

639
00:30:25,864 --> 00:30:26,900
Run it then, all right?

640
00:30:27,324 --> 00:30:29,611
- Take that to the radio station.
- To Love Daddy?

641
00:30:29,701 --> 00:30:31,863
Yeah, Love Daddy.

642
00:30:33,497 --> 00:30:35,910
Hey, Pop, I'm going
to go with Mookie, okay?

643
00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:39,458
Yeah. You make sure
Mookie don't jerk around.

644
00:30:39,544 --> 00:30:41,160
- Wait up, Mook!
- Oh, where you going?

645
00:30:41,254 --> 00:30:42,254
You ain't going anywhere.

646
00:30:42,339 --> 00:30:44,339
- Where the hell you going?
- How you doing?

647
00:30:44,674 --> 00:30:49,339
Vito, I know Pino's your brother and shit,
but you should kick his ass.

648
00:30:49,429 --> 00:30:51,716
The next time he touches you,
you should kick his ass.

649
00:30:51,807 --> 00:30:54,299
- Whoa, whoa!
- The next time he hits you, fuck him up!

650
00:30:54,393 --> 00:30:55,850
Whoa! Whoa! Hey, yo, Mook.

651
00:30:55,936 --> 00:30:59,179
I mean, I appreciate this concern,
and all,

652
00:30:59,272 --> 00:31:01,639
but I don't think
it's any of your business, really.

653
00:31:01,733 --> 00:31:04,271
I know it's none of my business,
but you need to kick his ass.

654
00:31:04,361 --> 00:31:05,647
Smiley, not now.

655
00:31:06,822 --> 00:31:09,280
If I had a brother like him,
we'd be fighting all the time.

656
00:31:09,366 --> 00:31:10,686
- Look, first of all...
- Smiley!

657
00:31:11,243 --> 00:31:13,656
First of all, Mook,
you don't got a brother like him.

658
00:31:13,745 --> 00:31:16,112
Smiley, get out of here!

659
00:31:16,206 --> 00:31:17,809
First of all,
you don't got a brother like him.

660
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:19,477
If you did,
you wouldn't know what to do with him

661
00:31:19,501 --> 00:31:20,978
because you never had a brother like him.

662
00:31:21,002 --> 00:31:22,605
He's my brother. I'm not going to hit him.

663
00:31:22,629 --> 00:31:24,589
- I got a sister.
- You never clocked your sister.

664
00:31:24,631 --> 00:31:27,123
- But I got a sister.
- Does she bug you like Pino bugs me?

665
00:31:27,217 --> 00:31:29,320
Yeah, but you're not supposed to
hit a girl like you hit a guy.

666
00:31:29,344 --> 00:31:30,988
- All right.
- Just fuck your brother up one time.

667
00:31:31,012 --> 00:31:34,255
It'll be over with, we'll be out
of this fucking conversation, all right?

668
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:37,141
You think it might do some good?

669
00:31:37,227 --> 00:31:39,719
Yes, all right? A lot of good.

670
00:31:39,813 --> 00:31:41,600
Let's give... Love Daddy!

671
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:45,650
Peoples, my stomach's been grumbling,
but help has arrived.

672
00:31:45,735 --> 00:31:49,228
My main man Mookie has saved the day!

673
00:31:49,322 --> 00:31:52,486
Straight from Sal's Famous Pizzeria
up the block.

674
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,784
Step up to the mike, Mookie.

675
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:57,283
Come on. Come on! Don't be shy.

676
00:31:57,372 --> 00:31:59,284
Mmm, this smells good.

677
00:31:59,374 --> 00:32:01,707
Go ahead. This is your Love Daddy talking,

678
00:32:01,793 --> 00:32:04,376
Starvin' like Marvin.
Say something to the people.

679
00:32:04,463 --> 00:32:06,830
All right, Love Daddy.
I'd like to dedicate this record

680
00:32:06,923 --> 00:32:11,088
with all my heart and soul... to Tina.

681
00:32:11,178 --> 00:32:14,091
All right! Let me put this song on

682
00:32:14,181 --> 00:32:16,969
while I go to work
on this chicken parmigiana hero

683
00:32:17,058 --> 00:32:20,722
with extra cheese and extra s-sauce.

684
00:32:26,693 --> 00:32:28,776
Yo, Stevie, man. Chill, man.

685
00:32:28,862 --> 00:32:31,299
- Shut up, man. I'm trying to read.
- Have some fucking respect, huh?

686
00:32:31,323 --> 00:32:33,923
- It's just a bad dream, man.
- What'd you hit me in the neck for?

687
00:32:33,992 --> 00:32:35,199
It's just a bad dream, man.

688
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,455
Yo, man, lower that, man!

689
00:32:53,386 --> 00:32:57,505
- I want to listen to my salsa music!
- Chill! Chill! Chill!

690
00:32:57,599 --> 00:32:59,807
You think you got it like that, bro?
<i>¿Chocolate?</i>

691
00:33:01,061 --> 00:33:02,347
Let's go, motherfucker!

692
00:33:02,437 --> 00:33:04,269
Turn it up, Stevie, baby!

693
00:33:04,356 --> 00:33:07,315
- Blow it, man, blow it!
- Yeah, blow it away!

694
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,753
Turn it up, Stevie!

695
00:33:08,777 --> 00:33:10,939
- Yeah, Yeah!
- Turn up the bongos!

696
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:13,521
Oh, yeah!

697
00:33:13,615 --> 00:33:17,825
Salsa!

698
00:33:22,332 --> 00:33:24,540
- Yo, Steve! Put it up louder, Steve.
- Yeah, man!

699
00:33:30,215 --> 00:33:32,548
<i>Pendejo!</i> Yeah, what's up?

700
00:33:37,222 --> 00:33:38,713
You got it, bro.

701
00:33:39,224 --> 00:33:41,887
Hey, <i>pendejo!</i>

702
00:33:43,645 --> 00:33:45,307
Come on, Steve, man.

703
00:33:49,985 --> 00:33:52,102
You're dead, choco-man.

704
00:33:52,195 --> 00:33:53,731
He's a punk anyway, man.

705
00:33:53,822 --> 00:33:56,405
Yo, <i>pendejo!</i>

706
00:33:58,952 --> 00:34:00,318
What's up?

707
00:34:00,412 --> 00:34:03,996
He's a sucker, man. He's a punk.
He's a sucker, man.

708
00:34:04,082 --> 00:34:06,574
- See that game last night?
- Uh-huh. I saw it.

709
00:34:06,668 --> 00:34:08,079
Best pitcher in the game...

710
00:34:09,004 --> 00:34:10,165
Dwight Gooden.

711
00:34:10,255 --> 00:34:12,358
- I knew you were gonna bring that up.
- Who's better?

712
00:34:12,382 --> 00:34:13,839
You know Roger Clemens is better.

713
00:34:13,925 --> 00:34:17,293
Clemens sucks, man.
He can't carry Dwight's jock.

714
00:34:17,387 --> 00:34:19,240
- Oh, man. How can you say...
- Dwight's best in the game.

715
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,784
- Who won consecutive Cy Young Awards?
- Dwight's best in the game.

716
00:34:21,808 --> 00:34:23,390
- What's up, Buggin' Out?
- Got you.

717
00:34:23,476 --> 00:34:24,842
- What's happening?
- You the man.

718
00:34:24,936 --> 00:34:26,163
- No, you the man.
- No, you the man.

719
00:34:26,187 --> 00:34:27,187
No, you the man.

720
00:34:27,272 --> 00:34:29,000
- No, you the man.
- No, I'm a struggling black man

721
00:34:29,024 --> 00:34:31,516
trying to keep my dick hard
in a cruel and harsh world.

722
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,818
Yo, hey, what's up with the white boy?

723
00:34:33,903 --> 00:34:35,644
Buggin' Out, don't start no shit,
all right?

724
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:38,777
Vito's down. Vito's down, all right?

725
00:34:38,867 --> 00:34:40,108
- All right?
- Yeah, right.

726
00:34:40,201 --> 00:34:42,067
- Vito's down.
- Yeah.

727
00:34:42,162 --> 00:34:43,278
Phew.

728
00:34:52,964 --> 00:34:54,080
Yo!

729
00:34:56,801 --> 00:34:57,801
Damn.

730
00:34:57,844 --> 00:34:58,960
Yo!

731
00:34:59,971 --> 00:35:00,971
Yeah?

732
00:35:08,271 --> 00:35:10,604
You almost knocked me down.
Man, the word is, "Excuse me."

733
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:12,877
- Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.
- Not only just knocked me down,

734
00:35:12,901 --> 00:35:15,860
you stepped on my brand-new
white Air Jordans I just bought.

735
00:35:15,945 --> 00:35:17,625
And that's all you can say is,
"Excuse me?"

736
00:35:17,697 --> 00:35:19,258
- What, you're serious?
- Yeah, I'm serious.

737
00:35:19,282 --> 00:35:21,162
- I'll fuck you up quick two times!
- Two times!

738
00:35:21,201 --> 00:35:22,428
Who told you to step on my sneakers?

739
00:35:22,452 --> 00:35:23,512
Who told you
to walk on my side of the block?

740
00:35:23,536 --> 00:35:25,931
- Who told you to be in my neighborhood?
- I own this brownstone.

741
00:35:25,955 --> 00:35:29,119
Who told you to buy a brownstone
on my block, in my neighborhood

742
00:35:29,209 --> 00:35:31,075
on my side of the street?

743
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:33,522
What do you want to live
in a black neighborhood for, anyway, man?

744
00:35:33,546 --> 00:35:35,208
- Motherfuck gentrification.
- Well?

745
00:35:35,298 --> 00:35:37,460
As I understand it,
this is a free country.

746
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,528
- A man can live wherever he wants.
- Free country.

747
00:35:39,552 --> 00:35:40,613
Free country?

748
00:35:40,637 --> 00:35:43,380
Man, I should fuck you up for saying
that stupid shit alone!

749
00:35:43,473 --> 00:35:46,056
Yo, man, your Jordans are fucked up!

750
00:35:46,142 --> 00:35:48,634
Damn, man.
You might as well throw them shits out.

751
00:35:48,728 --> 00:35:49,889
Them shits is broke!

752
00:35:49,979 --> 00:35:51,457
They looked good before he messed them up.

753
00:35:51,481 --> 00:35:54,474
He did this shit on purpose, man.
He was even talking about your mama.

754
00:35:54,567 --> 00:35:56,629
I heard that shit, too.
Man, they used to be so fine!

755
00:35:56,653 --> 00:35:58,756
- Yo, man, how much you pay for 'em?
- A hundred bucks!

756
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,737
- American dollars.
- $108 with tax.

757
00:36:00,824 --> 00:36:02,426
- I'd give him 100 headaches.
- Look, you're lucky

758
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:04,191
the black man has a loving heart.

759
00:36:04,285 --> 00:36:05,971
Next time you see me coming,
you cross the street.

760
00:36:05,995 --> 00:36:07,755
- I'm out of here.
- Yo, man, break his feet!

761
00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:09,631
- Damn, my brand-new Jordans!
- Take his bike!

762
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:11,060
I should make you buy me another pair!

763
00:36:11,084 --> 00:36:12,950
- Black Panther, whip his ass!
- Take his bike!

764
00:36:13,044 --> 00:36:15,189
- Man, kick his ass!
- You're lucky I'm a righteous black man!

765
00:36:15,213 --> 00:36:17,296
Otherwise, you'd be in serious trouble,
man! Serious!

766
00:36:17,382 --> 00:36:20,045
- Fuck him up!
- Man, let's fuck him up.

767
00:36:20,552 --> 00:36:21,946
Man, why don't you
move back to Massachusetts?

768
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,677
I was born in Brooklyn.

769
00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:28,057
Get outta here!

770
00:36:28,685 --> 00:36:30,893
I should send Vito with you all the time.

771
00:36:33,064 --> 00:36:36,853
Yeah. No more 90-minute deliveries
around the corner.

772
00:36:36,943 --> 00:36:39,686
Pino, I work hard like
everybody else in here, all right?

773
00:36:39,779 --> 00:36:41,270
You know that's true, Pino.

774
00:36:43,783 --> 00:36:45,240
Vito, come here.

775
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:47,826
Come here.

776
00:36:53,752 --> 00:36:55,368
What's going on between you two?

777
00:36:56,379 --> 00:36:58,858
You guys boyfriend and girlfriend
or something? Something I don't know?

778
00:36:58,882 --> 00:37:00,373
- What'd we just talk about?
- What?

779
00:37:01,509 --> 00:37:04,047
- What did we just talk about?
- What are you talking about?

780
00:37:04,137 --> 00:37:06,094
- Smack him.
- Hey! Hey!

781
00:37:06,181 --> 00:37:08,468
Any smacking around here
is gonna be done by me.

782
00:37:10,226 --> 00:37:13,594
You gonna listen to this <i>shagamay,</i>
listen to him tell you to smack me,

783
00:37:13,688 --> 00:37:14,688
your older brother?

784
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,567
Just remember who you are, all right?

785
00:37:20,653 --> 00:37:24,112
Your name is Vito Frangione,
not Vito Muhammad.

786
00:37:24,491 --> 00:37:25,607
Huh?

787
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:36,041
I would love for you
to stay out of my business.

788
00:37:36,586 --> 00:37:39,044
Stop putting these thoughts
into my brother's head, okay?

789
00:37:39,881 --> 00:37:42,624
Look, I don't play
that Muhammad shit, all right?

790
00:37:42,717 --> 00:37:44,049
What Muhammad shit?

791
00:37:44,135 --> 00:37:46,923
Look... Don't fuck me, all right?

792
00:37:48,348 --> 00:37:49,634
Oh, man.

793
00:37:51,142 --> 00:37:52,633
Fuck, man.

794
00:38:00,318 --> 00:38:02,685
I hate this place. I hate this place.

795
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,909
What a waste.

796
00:38:57,208 --> 00:39:00,667
As I was saying
before we were so rudely interrupted

797
00:39:00,753 --> 00:39:05,123
- by New York City's finest...
- What was you saying?

798
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:07,128
The motherfucker wasn't saying shit.

799
00:39:07,218 --> 00:39:09,551
Yeah. Look at that.

800
00:39:10,179 --> 00:39:11,590
Look at what?

801
00:39:11,681 --> 00:39:14,094
It's a goddamn shame.

802
00:39:14,183 --> 00:39:16,095
What's a goddamn shame?

803
00:39:16,185 --> 00:39:18,347
- Sweet Dick Willie.
- That's my name.

804
00:39:19,063 --> 00:39:20,929
Goddamn, man, do I have to spell it out?

805
00:39:21,024 --> 00:39:22,515
Come on, man, make it plain.

806
00:39:22,609 --> 00:39:25,693
Okay, but listen up.
I'm going to break it down.

807
00:39:25,778 --> 00:39:27,269
Let it be broke, motherfucker.

808
00:39:27,363 --> 00:39:28,979
- Can you dig it?
- It's dug.

809
00:39:30,074 --> 00:39:33,488
Look at those Korean motherfuckers
across the street.

810
00:39:34,495 --> 00:39:36,452
I bet you they haven't been
off the boat a year

811
00:39:36,539 --> 00:39:37,850
before they opened up their own place.

812
00:39:37,874 --> 00:39:40,161
That's right, man. It's been about a year.

813
00:39:40,251 --> 00:39:42,288
A motherfuckin' year
off the motherfuckin' boat,

814
00:39:42,378 --> 00:39:44,836
and they already got a business
in our neighborhood.

815
00:39:44,923 --> 00:39:46,380
A good business...

816
00:39:46,966 --> 00:39:50,084
occupying a building
that had been boarded up

817
00:39:50,178 --> 00:39:52,090
for longer than I care to remember,

818
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,923
and I've been here a long time.

819
00:39:55,016 --> 00:39:57,383
- Yeah, he been here a long time.
- Hey, boy.

820
00:39:57,477 --> 00:39:59,469
And now, for the life of me...

821
00:40:00,605 --> 00:40:02,642
You know, I can't figure this out.

822
00:40:02,732 --> 00:40:06,271
Either them Korean motherfuckers
are geniuses...

823
00:40:07,737 --> 00:40:11,276
or you black asses are just plain dumb.

824
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,200
Fuck you.

825
00:40:13,284 --> 00:40:16,197
It's got to be because we're black.

826
00:40:16,287 --> 00:40:18,745
Ain't no other explanation.
No, no, I know, man.

827
00:40:18,831 --> 00:40:20,743
You know it's true.
Ain't they always trying

828
00:40:20,833 --> 00:40:22,353
to keep the black man to be about shit!

829
00:40:22,377 --> 00:40:24,960
Oh, oh!
You motherfuckers hold that shit down.

830
00:40:25,046 --> 00:40:27,709
I'm tired of that old excuse.
I'm tired of hearing that shit.

831
00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:29,711
- Shit.
- You know, I tell you. I swear, man,

832
00:40:29,801 --> 00:40:33,636
I will be one happy fool
when we open our own business

833
00:40:33,721 --> 00:40:35,462
right here in our neighborhood.

834
00:40:35,556 --> 00:40:38,890
I swear to God.
I will be first in line to spend

835
00:40:38,977 --> 00:40:40,955
- what little money I got.
- I'll be right there with you, man.

836
00:40:40,979 --> 00:40:44,472
You motherfuckers are always talking
that old Keith Sweat shit...

837
00:40:44,565 --> 00:40:47,228
"I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna do that."

838
00:40:47,318 --> 00:40:51,608
You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing
but sit your monkey ass on this corner.

839
00:40:51,698 --> 00:40:53,815
Hey, ML, when you gonna get your business?

840
00:40:54,242 --> 00:40:56,074
Huh? Yeah, just like I thought.

841
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,696
You ain't going to do a goddamn thing.

842
00:40:57,787 --> 00:40:59,653
But I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
Hear me?

843
00:40:59,747 --> 00:41:01,934
I'm gonna go there and give
them Koreans more of my money.

844
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:04,701
Fuck outta my way, goddamn.
It's Miller time, motherfuckers.

845
00:41:04,794 --> 00:41:07,252
Old moose head fuckers
telling me what to do.

846
00:41:07,338 --> 00:41:08,978
And Coconut, you got a lot of damn nerve.

847
00:41:09,048 --> 00:41:12,007
You got off the boat, too.
Hell, leave me alone. Shoot.

848
00:41:12,093 --> 00:41:15,461
Hey, Kung Fu! Come on.
Give me one of them damn beers, damn it.

849
00:41:15,555 --> 00:41:17,616
- What? No more free beer.
- Get your ass in there and serve me some.

850
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,118
- No more free beer.
- Don't be pushing on me, baby.

851
00:41:19,142 --> 00:41:21,008
- Hey, man, no more free beer.
- I'll drop you.

852
00:41:21,102 --> 00:41:22,830
- Don't start no shit with me.
- Mr. Sweet Dick.

853
00:41:22,854 --> 00:41:24,561
That's right.
Sweet Dick Willie is my name.

854
00:41:24,647 --> 00:41:25,647
That's my name.

855
00:41:25,732 --> 00:41:28,520
It's a motherfuckin' shame.

856
00:41:29,318 --> 00:41:30,775
Man, ain't that a bitch?

857
00:41:36,826 --> 00:41:39,193
- Hey, doctor. What's your name?
- Eddie.

858
00:41:39,287 --> 00:41:40,698
- How old are you?
- Ten.

859
00:41:40,788 --> 00:41:42,825
Question: What makes Sammy run?

860
00:41:42,915 --> 00:41:46,158
- I said my name is Eddie.
- What makes Sammy run?

861
00:41:46,252 --> 00:41:49,245
- My name is Eddie Lovell.
- Relax.

862
00:41:49,338 --> 00:41:51,125
Eddie,
I want you to go to the store for me.

863
00:41:51,215 --> 00:41:52,706
Question: How much is it gonna cost?

864
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,570
How am I supposed to know
how much it's gonna cost

865
00:41:54,594 --> 00:41:56,074
if I don't even know what I'm buying?

866
00:41:56,137 --> 00:41:58,720
Eddie,
you're too smart for your own britches.

867
00:41:58,806 --> 00:42:02,766
Now listen to me. How much do you want
to go to the corner store for Da Mayor?

868
00:42:02,852 --> 00:42:05,310
- Fifty cents.
- You got a deal. Here.

869
00:42:05,396 --> 00:42:09,356
I want you to get me a quart of beer.
Miller High Life.

870
00:42:09,442 --> 00:42:12,276
Anybody bother you, say
it's for your bedridden, old granddaddy.

871
00:42:12,361 --> 00:42:13,977
Now, go on. Go!

872
00:42:15,782 --> 00:42:17,489
What is wrong with him, man?

873
00:42:17,575 --> 00:42:19,567
He ain't be giving nobody no money.

874
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,777
- Leave the man alone.
- Look at this here, man.

875
00:42:21,871 --> 00:42:23,807
- This is nice, man.
- You need to cut this shit out.

876
00:42:23,831 --> 00:42:25,831
Man, who told you
you were the mayor of this block?

877
00:42:25,917 --> 00:42:27,408
Shit, he's self-appointed.

878
00:42:27,502 --> 00:42:29,585
- Man, leave the man alone. Damn.
- Shut up!

879
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,411
- Yeah, yeah, look, look, look.
- Damn.

880
00:42:31,506 --> 00:42:34,465
- Y'all leave me the hell alone.
- Ah, man.

881
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,086
I ain't going out like that, man.

882
00:42:36,177 --> 00:42:37,946
You walk up and down this block
like you own it.

883
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:40,257
For real, His Honor.

884
00:42:40,348 --> 00:42:42,076
You're so old, you're like a fossil.

885
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:45,889
Yo, man, you're a bum, man.
You're an old drunk zero, man.

886
00:42:45,978 --> 00:42:47,578
Now what do you got to say for yourself?

887
00:42:48,356 --> 00:42:49,722
What you know about me?

888
00:42:50,733 --> 00:42:52,690
Can't even pee straight,
nary a one of you.

889
00:42:52,777 --> 00:42:54,234
What you know about anything?

890
00:42:56,072 --> 00:42:57,072
Unless you...

891
00:42:58,533 --> 00:43:00,274
Unless you done stood in the door...

892
00:43:01,327 --> 00:43:04,661
and listened to your five hungry children
crying for bread.

893
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:07,372
And you can't do a damn thing about it.

894
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:10,041
Your woman standing there...
You can't even look her in the eye.

895
00:43:10,128 --> 00:43:13,997
Unless you done that, you don't know me,
my pain, my hurt, my feelings.

896
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:16,173
- You don't know shit!
- Oh, man!

897
00:43:16,259 --> 00:43:18,403
- Let the old man finish.
- Don't call me bum.

898
00:43:18,427 --> 00:43:20,043
Don't call me a drunk.

899
00:43:20,972 --> 00:43:23,430
Y'all ain't got the sense
that God give a billy goat!

900
00:43:23,516 --> 00:43:26,429
Don't call me nothing! It's disrespectful.

901
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:28,761
I know your mamas and your papas
raised you better.

902
00:43:28,855 --> 00:43:31,393
Yo, man, I hope you finished
your little soliloquy, man,

903
00:43:31,482 --> 00:43:34,316
'cause first of all,
I been peeing straight for years.

904
00:43:34,402 --> 00:43:35,546
You understand what I'm saying?

905
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:36,902
And you're right.

906
00:43:36,988 --> 00:43:40,026
I wouldn't stand in the doorway
listening to my five children go hungry.

907
00:43:40,116 --> 00:43:42,654
I'd be out getting a job,
doing something, anything,

908
00:43:42,743 --> 00:43:43,863
to put food in their mouths.

909
00:43:43,953 --> 00:43:45,793
And you're right.
I don't wanna know your pain.

910
00:43:45,872 --> 00:43:47,113
I don't care to know your pain.

911
00:43:47,206 --> 00:43:49,448
You're the one that put yourself
in this situation, man.

912
00:43:49,542 --> 00:43:53,752
Every day... Every day, I see you
walk up and down this block, inebriated.

913
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:55,190
- Chill, man.
- Never sober!

914
00:43:55,214 --> 00:43:56,942
- He's an old man.
- But that's what D-A stands for.

915
00:43:56,966 --> 00:43:58,423
"Da" Mayor... drunk ass.

916
00:43:58,509 --> 00:43:59,590
Man, come on!

917
00:43:59,677 --> 00:44:01,488
- Fuck that! This man's getting me mad!
- Ahmad, Ahmad!

918
00:44:01,512 --> 00:44:03,991
He don't get no respect! He ain't never
gonna get respect here, boy!

919
00:44:04,015 --> 00:44:05,784
How you gonna tell me
how my parents raised me?

920
00:44:05,808 --> 00:44:08,346
- I respect those who respect themselves!
- Ahmad! Come on, man!

921
00:44:08,436 --> 00:44:11,165
He's not gonna respect himself as
someone who drinks like a fuckin' fool!

922
00:44:14,358 --> 00:44:16,270
Tina,
I know I haven't seen you in four days.

923
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,297
- I'm a working man.
<i>- Uh, that's really nice,</i>

924
00:44:18,321 --> 00:44:20,563
<i>but you know, I work, too,
and I seem to make time.</i>

925
00:44:22,658 --> 00:44:24,115
What do you want me to do, huh?

926
00:44:24,202 --> 00:44:26,410
<i>I want you to spend some time
with me and Hector!</i>

927
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:29,704
<i>I want you to try
and make this relationship work.</i>

928
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:32,373
<i>If not,
I'd rather not be bothered with your ass.</i>

929
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,874
<i>- Mookie, you are too, too tired.</i>
- All right, all right. Damn.

930
00:44:35,963 --> 00:44:37,670
I'll be over sometime today.

931
00:44:37,757 --> 00:44:39,089
<i>You always say later!</i>

932
00:44:39,175 --> 00:44:41,041
Later, say, if I get off work.

933
00:44:41,135 --> 00:44:43,297
<i>Bring some ice cream. I'm burning up.</i>

934
00:44:43,387 --> 00:44:46,300
<i>Mookie, do you love me?</i>

935
00:44:48,726 --> 00:44:51,013
- Do I love you?
- Mookie, get off the phone!

936
00:44:52,438 --> 00:44:56,227
Be off in a second, all right, Sal?
Do I love you?

937
00:44:56,317 --> 00:44:58,730
I dedicated a record
on Love Daddy's show to you.

938
00:44:58,819 --> 00:45:00,105
<i>So what?</i>

939
00:45:00,196 --> 00:45:03,314
How's anybody going to call in, Mookie?

940
00:45:03,407 --> 00:45:06,024
- All right!
<i>- My God, you probably wasted...</i>

941
00:45:06,494 --> 00:45:08,486
You know, if that ain't love,
you're crazy.

942
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:10,821
Are you deaf or what?

943
00:45:10,915 --> 00:45:13,328
Pino, I'm talking on the phone.

944
00:45:13,417 --> 00:45:15,875
I can see that.

945
00:45:15,962 --> 00:45:17,749
Tina, I gotta go.

946
00:45:17,838 --> 00:45:19,454
Yeah, Pino's an asshole.

947
00:45:19,548 --> 00:45:21,961
I'll see you later today. Later!

948
00:45:22,051 --> 00:45:24,634
Everybody happy?

949
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,720
Sal's Famous.

950
00:45:25,763 --> 00:45:27,324
- <i>Yeah, delivery.</i>
- Yeah. Yeah, okay.

951
00:45:27,348 --> 00:45:32,184
- You got two large anchovy and pepperoni.
<i>- Hurry up.</i>

952
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:34,227
Okay. Just hold on one second.

953
00:45:34,313 --> 00:45:36,805
See, Daddy?
Mookie's fucking talking on the phone,

954
00:45:36,899 --> 00:45:38,686
people are trying to call in orders.

955
00:45:38,776 --> 00:45:40,267
He's making us lose business.

956
00:45:40,361 --> 00:45:41,647
Mookie!

957
00:45:41,737 --> 00:45:44,480
Twenty minutes.

958
00:45:44,573 --> 00:45:46,485
How come niggers are so stupid?

959
00:45:47,535 --> 00:45:49,151
If you see a nigger, kick his ass.

960
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,111
Fuck you, and stay off the phone.

961
00:45:51,205 --> 00:45:53,197
Hey, Mookie. Forget about it.

962
00:45:54,792 --> 00:45:56,533
Can I talk to you for a second?

963
00:45:59,297 --> 00:46:00,297
What?

964
00:46:00,381 --> 00:46:02,543
Pino,
who's your favorite basketball player?

965
00:46:03,009 --> 00:46:04,009
Magic Johnson.

966
00:46:04,093 --> 00:46:06,631
- Who's your favorite movie star?
- Eddie Murphy.

967
00:46:06,721 --> 00:46:08,087
Who's your favorite rock star?

968
00:46:08,973 --> 00:46:10,509
Prince. You're a Prince freak.

969
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:12,431
- Boss. Bruce.
- Prince.

970
00:46:12,518 --> 00:46:13,518
Bruce.

971
00:46:13,602 --> 00:46:16,345
Pino, all you talk about is
nigger this and nigger that.

972
00:46:16,439 --> 00:46:18,439
And all your favorite people
are so-called niggers.

973
00:46:18,524 --> 00:46:21,016
It's different. Magic, Eddie, Prince...

974
00:46:21,569 --> 00:46:22,605
are not niggers.

975
00:46:23,237 --> 00:46:24,853
I mean, they're not black. I mean...

976
00:46:26,032 --> 00:46:27,032
Let me explain myself.

977
00:46:27,116 --> 00:46:28,607
They're... They're not really black.

978
00:46:29,368 --> 00:46:31,096
I mean, they're black,
but they're not really black.

979
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,578
They're more than black. It's different.

980
00:46:33,664 --> 00:46:36,407
- It's different?
- Yeah. To me, it's different.

981
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,645
Pino, deep down inside,
I think you wish you were black.

982
00:46:38,669 --> 00:46:41,252
Get the fuck out of here.

983
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:44,503
Laugh if you want to.
You know, your hair is kinkier than mine.

984
00:46:45,426 --> 00:46:46,837
What does that mean?

985
00:46:46,927 --> 00:46:49,419
And you know what they say
about dark Italians.

986
00:46:49,513 --> 00:46:52,972
You know, I been listening and reading...

987
00:46:53,059 --> 00:46:55,142
- You been reading now?
- I read.

988
00:46:56,395 --> 00:46:58,603
I've been reading about your leaders.

989
00:46:58,689 --> 00:47:01,523
Reverend Al "Mister 'Do" Sharpton.

990
00:47:01,609 --> 00:47:04,272
Jesse. "Keep hope alive."

991
00:47:04,362 --> 00:47:06,354
- That's fucked up.
- "Keep hope alive."

992
00:47:06,447 --> 00:47:08,154
Hey, that's fucked.
Don't talk about Jesse.

993
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,607
And even the other guy, what's his name?

994
00:47:10,701 --> 00:47:12,237
Faraman, Fairakan...

995
00:47:12,328 --> 00:47:13,364
Minister Farrakhan.

996
00:47:13,454 --> 00:47:14,454
Right. Sorry.

997
00:47:14,538 --> 00:47:16,450
Minister Farrakhan.

998
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:20,784
Anyway, Minister Farrakhan
always talks about the so-called day

999
00:47:21,379 --> 00:47:23,041
when the black man will rise.

1000
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:24,792
"We will one day..." What does he say?

1001
00:47:24,882 --> 00:47:28,046
"We will one day rule the Earth
as we did in our glorious past."

1002
00:47:28,135 --> 00:47:30,843
- Yeah, that's right.
- What past you talkin' about?

1003
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:31,930
I mean, what did I miss?

1004
00:47:31,972 --> 00:47:33,554
We started civilization.

1005
00:47:33,641 --> 00:47:36,429
Man, keep dreaming, man. Then you woke up!

1006
00:47:37,269 --> 00:47:41,889
Pino, fuck you. Fuck your fucking pizza,
and fuck Frank Sinatra.

1007

Yeah? Well, fuck you, too,

titsoon, spade, <i>mulignan.</i>

1017

Take your fucking piece of pizza
and go the fuck back to Africa.

1018
00:48:14,765 --> 00:48:17,223
You little slanty-eyed,

Y'all, take a chill!

1033
00:48:53,387 --> 00:48:56,300
Ya need to cool that shit out!

1034

And that's the double truth, Ruth!

1035
00:49:02,813 --> 00:49:04,429
Sal, can you do me a favor?

1036
00:49:05,107 --> 00:49:06,643
That depends, Mookie.

1037
00:49:06,734 --> 00:49:07,815
Can you pay me now?

1038
00:49:10,154 --> 00:49:11,690
I can't do that.

1039
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:14,067
Sal, just this once.
Can't you do me a solid, man?

1040
00:49:14,158 --> 00:49:15,399
No. Tonight when we close.

1041
00:49:18,287 --> 00:49:19,573
Sal, I want to get paid now.

1042
00:49:19,663 --> 00:49:22,451
Look, you know you get paid tonight
when we close.

1043
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:24,203
All right? We're still open.

1044
00:49:24,293 --> 00:49:27,001
All right, if I pay you now,
I won't see you tonight.

1045
00:49:27,087 --> 00:49:28,544
That's a bet.

1046
00:49:28,631 --> 00:49:30,247
Yeah, that's a bet, huh.

1047
00:49:30,341 --> 00:49:31,610
I'm going to remember that, Sal.

1048
00:49:31,634 --> 00:49:33,671
You got to do what you got to do,
you know?

1049
00:49:33,761 --> 00:49:34,842
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1050
00:49:34,929 --> 00:49:37,216
- I'm gonna remember that.
- I want you to remember that.

1051
00:49:37,306 --> 00:49:39,889
Please do me a favor, huh, Mook?
Remember that.

1052
00:49:53,739 --> 00:49:55,571
Come on, Sal.

1053
00:49:55,658 --> 00:49:56,819
I can't.

1054
00:50:04,959 --> 00:50:06,951
Radio Raheem!

1055
00:50:07,044 --> 00:50:08,044
Mook.

1056
00:50:09,171 --> 00:50:10,332
What's happening?

1057
00:50:10,422 --> 00:50:12,163
- It's your world.
- Where you headed to?

1058
00:50:12,258 --> 00:50:14,045
I'm going to get a slice.

1059
00:50:14,134 --> 00:50:15,500
- You going down to Sal's?
- Word.

1060
00:50:15,594 --> 00:50:18,132
I gotta make a few deliveries,
and I'll check you back there.

1061
00:50:18,222 --> 00:50:20,259
- On the rebound.
- Bet. All right.

1062

Oh, shit! Let me check it out.

1063

- That's the hype!
- Newest latest.

1064
00:50:28,232 --> 00:50:30,770
Let me tell you the story
of right hand/left hand.

1065
00:50:31,443 --> 00:50:33,150
It's a tale of good and evil.

1066
00:50:34,238 --> 00:50:35,945
Hate.

1067
00:50:36,031 --> 00:50:39,274
It was with this hand
that Cain iced his brother.

1068
00:50:40,327 --> 00:50:42,444
Love.

1069
00:50:42,538 --> 00:50:46,327
These five fingers,
they go straight to the soul of man.

1070
00:50:46,834 --> 00:50:49,872
The right hand... the hand of love.

1071
00:50:51,255 --> 00:50:53,872
The story of life is this.

1072
00:50:55,843 --> 00:50:57,175
Static.

1073
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:02,047
One hand is always
fighting the other hand,

1074
00:51:02,558 --> 00:51:04,720
and the left hand is kicking much ass.

1075
00:51:05,269 --> 00:51:08,603
I mean, it looks like the right hand,
love, is finished.

1076
00:51:08,689 --> 00:51:10,396
But hold on. Stop the presses.

1077
00:51:10,482 --> 00:51:12,314
The right hand's coming back.

1078
00:51:12,401 --> 00:51:14,939
Yeah, he got the left hand
on the ropes now.

1079
00:51:15,029 --> 00:51:16,861
That's right. Yeah. Ooh!

1080
00:51:16,947 --> 00:51:20,315
It's a devastating right,
and hate is hurt and down!

1081
00:51:20,409 --> 00:51:23,902
Ooh! Ooh! Left hand, hate, K.O.'d by love.

1082
00:51:27,416 --> 00:51:29,703
If I love you, I love you.

1083
00:51:32,046 --> 00:51:33,958
But if I hate you...

1084
00:51:35,424 --> 00:51:37,131
There it is, love and hate.

1085
00:51:38,927 --> 00:51:40,463
- I love you, brother.
- Bet.

1086
00:51:41,472 --> 00:51:44,135

I'm working.

You know, Sal pays you, Mookie.

Don't be yelling at me, now.

Yo, man, it's hot as a motherfucker.

1199
00:57:17,015 --> 00:57:19,723
- Why don't you fan me with your ears?
- Stop playin'!

1200
00:57:24,314 --> 00:57:25,930
Leave it alone.

1201
00:57:26,024 --> 00:57:28,186
- Why y'all think everything is a joke?
- Man, shut up.

1202
00:57:28,276 --> 00:57:30,233
Chill, man. It's too hot for that.

1203
00:57:32,864 --> 00:57:34,592
That's why I asked you
what you want to do.

1204
00:57:34,616 --> 00:57:36,323
We don't have money to do anything.

1205
00:57:50,048 --> 00:57:51,380
I'm beat.

1206
00:57:54,886 --> 00:57:57,879
Daddy, you know, I've been thinking.

1207
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:01,807
Maybe we should sell this place.

1208
00:58:02,602 --> 00:58:05,561
Get out while we're still ahead...
and alive.

1209
00:58:08,734 --> 00:58:11,147
You really think you know
what's best for us, Pino?

1210
00:58:12,029 --> 00:58:14,737
Maybe we could... Couldn't we sell this

1211
00:58:14,823 --> 00:58:18,362
and open up a new one
in our own neighborhood?

1212
00:58:19,286 --> 00:58:21,949
There's too many pizzerias already there.

1213
00:58:22,039 --> 00:58:23,780
Then maybe we could try
something different.

1214
00:58:23,874 --> 00:58:26,116
What am I gonna do? That's all I know.

1215
00:58:26,209 --> 00:58:28,371
What am I doing? I been here 25 years.

1216
00:58:28,462 --> 00:58:29,953
Where am I going?

1217
00:58:33,383 --> 00:58:34,840
I'm sick of niggers.

1218
00:58:35,927 --> 00:58:38,840
It's like I come to work,
it's <i>Planet of the Apes.</i>

1219
00:58:40,057 --> 00:58:43,346
I don't like being around them.
They're animals.

1220
00:58:45,854 --> 00:58:47,891
Why you got so much anger in you?

1221
00:58:49,608 --> 00:58:52,817
Why? I'll tell you why.
My friends, they laugh at me.

1222
00:58:54,279 --> 00:58:56,316
They laugh right in my face.

1223
00:58:56,406 --> 00:58:59,490
They tell me, "Go. Go to Bed-Stuy.
Go, go feed the moulies."

1224
00:59:01,912 --> 00:59:04,575
Do your friends put money
in your pocket, Pino?

1225
00:59:05,332 --> 00:59:06,743
Food on your table?

1226
00:59:06,833 --> 00:59:10,247
They pay your rent,
a roof over your head? Huh?

1227
00:59:12,089 --> 00:59:13,625
They're not your friends.

1228
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,087
If they were your friends,
they wouldn't laugh at you.

1229
00:59:19,346 --> 00:59:21,508
Pop, what can I say?
I don't want to be here.

1230
00:59:22,516 --> 00:59:24,223
They don't want us here.

1231
00:59:24,309 --> 00:59:26,221
We should stay in our own neighborhood,

1232
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,263
in Bensonhurst,
and niggers should stay in theirs.

1233
00:59:29,356 --> 00:59:31,723
I never had no trouble with these people.

1234
00:59:34,444 --> 00:59:35,651
I sat in this window, I...

1235
00:59:37,322 --> 00:59:39,405
I watch these little kids get old.

1236
00:59:40,826 --> 00:59:42,909
And I seen the old people get older.

1237
00:59:43,703 --> 00:59:46,411
Yeah, sure, some of them don't like us,
but most of them do.

1238
00:59:49,084 --> 00:59:52,327
I mean, for Christ sake, Pino,
they grew up on my food.

1239
00:59:52,879 --> 00:59:54,461
On my food.

1240
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,877
Now, I'm very proud of that.

1241
00:59:56,967 --> 00:59:59,926
You may think it's funny,
but I'm very proud of that.

1242
01:00:03,098 --> 01:00:05,806
Look, what I'm trying
to say, son, is, uh...

1243
01:00:07,936 --> 01:00:10,474
Sal's Famous Pizzeria is here to stay.

1244
01:00:11,606 --> 01:00:13,017
I'm sorry.

1245
01:00:14,067 --> 01:00:15,478
I'm your father, and I love you.

1246
01:00:15,569 --> 01:00:16,980
I'm sorry, but...

1247
01:00:18,155 --> 01:00:19,691
but that's the way it is.

1248
01:00:29,624 --> 01:00:32,708
Hey, S-Sal.

1249
01:00:32,794 --> 01:00:35,286
- Hey, S-Sal.
- How you doing?

1250
01:00:35,714 --> 01:00:38,422
These are $2.00.

1251
01:00:39,259 --> 01:00:40,750
Get out.

1252
01:00:43,346 --> 01:00:46,180
Get the fuck out of here, man!

1253
01:00:46,266 --> 01:00:48,132
Get the fuck out of here!

1254
01:00:49,603 --> 01:00:51,265
Two dollars.

1255
01:00:52,647 --> 01:00:54,559
Sal.

1256
01:00:56,276 --> 01:00:58,939
Come on. Get out of here.
Get the fuck out of here, man!

1257
01:00:59,029 --> 01:01:01,709

1258
01:01:01,781 --> 01:01:04,239
- Hey, hey!
- Hey, what?

1259
01:01:04,326 --> 01:01:06,613
Oh, yeah? Get a fucking job, man!

1260
01:01:06,703 --> 01:01:08,820
Why don't you get a fucking job, man?

1261
01:01:08,914 --> 01:01:10,906
Go to fucking work!

1262
01:01:10,999 --> 01:01:13,036
- Fuck you, man.
- S-S-Sal.

1263
01:01:13,126 --> 01:01:14,788
Get out, man. Get out!

1264
01:01:14,878 --> 01:01:16,039
See what I'm saying?

1265
01:01:16,129 --> 01:01:18,542
Leave that boy alone, man.
You know he ain't right!

1266
01:01:18,632 --> 01:01:21,966
- Goddamn!
- Get a fucking job, man!

1267
01:01:22,052 --> 01:01:23,918
- I'm sick of this shit.
- You get a job!

1268
01:01:24,012 --> 01:01:26,755
Huh? What? I got a job. I got a job, man.

1269
01:01:26,848 --> 01:01:29,285
- Bring your ass over here, punk!
- No, I ain't going over there.

1270
01:01:29,309 --> 01:01:30,641
I got no reason to go over there.

1271
01:01:30,727 --> 01:01:33,140
- F-F-F-Fuck...
- I got no reason to go over there.

1272
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:35,813
- What are you gonna do, fuckin' jump me?
- F-F-Fuck you!

1273
01:01:35,899 --> 01:01:37,891
Fuck you, man! Get the fuck out of here!

1274
01:01:37,984 --> 01:01:41,227
F-F-F-Fuck you!

1275
01:01:41,321 --> 01:01:42,983
Go inside. Go inside.

1276
01:01:43,073 --> 01:01:44,985
Smiley, here, here, here. Smiley, here.

1277
01:01:45,075 --> 01:01:46,691

1280
01:01:51,206 --> 01:01:53,309
Hey, Willie, take it easy.
He didn't mean nothin'.

1281
01:01:55,502 --> 01:01:56,663
- Okay?
- Fuck!

1282
01:01:56,753 --> 01:01:58,745
- Fuck you!
- This is what I'm talking about.

1283
01:01:59,506 --> 01:02:00,997
Whoo!

1284
01:02:01,967 --> 01:02:03,378
Let's go, Jade!

1285
01:02:05,262 --> 01:02:07,128
Da Mayor, we need your leadership.

1286
01:02:07,973 --> 01:02:11,387
- Doctor, what are you talking about?
- I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous.

1287
01:02:11,768 --> 01:02:14,351
Shit. Keep walking, doctor.

1288
01:02:14,437 --> 01:02:17,521
I don't want to hear
none of your damn black foolishness.

1289
01:02:17,607 --> 01:02:19,348
Damn. No juice.

1290
01:02:21,778 --> 01:02:25,237
No, man, no.

1291
01:02:26,116 --> 01:02:27,232
No!

1292
01:02:27,325 --> 01:02:28,987
Hell, no, goddamn it.

1293
01:02:29,077 --> 01:02:31,615
Sal ain't never done nothin' to you
before, man, and me neither.

1294
01:02:31,705 --> 01:02:34,664
Hear me? What you ought to do
is boycott that goddamn barber

1295
01:02:34,749 --> 01:02:37,787
that fucked up your head.

1296
01:02:37,877 --> 01:02:38,877
Shit.

1297
01:02:38,962 --> 01:02:41,170
Come around here,
fuckin' with Sweet Dick Willie.

1298
01:02:41,256 --> 01:02:42,942
- Go on, man. Get out.
- Get the fuck away.

1299
01:02:42,966 --> 01:02:43,966
Go on, beat it.

1300
01:02:44,050 --> 01:02:46,362
Would you sign a petition
to boycott Sal's Famous Pizzeria?

1301
01:02:46,386 --> 01:02:47,547
- What?
- What?

1302
01:02:47,637 --> 01:02:50,846
Man, I ain't boycottin' jack,
you string-cheese head motherfucker.

1303
01:02:50,932 --> 01:02:52,719
I'm about to go get a slice right now.

1304
01:02:52,809 --> 01:02:54,766
Shit, I was born and raised
on Sal's pizza.

1305
01:02:54,853 --> 01:02:56,640
- What the fuck you talkin' about?
- Shit.

1306
01:02:56,730 --> 01:02:58,642
You crazy, man?

1307
01:02:58,732 --> 01:03:00,564
As good as them motherfuckin' pizzas is?

1308
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:02,482
Black Panther eat pizza, we eat pizza.

1309
01:03:02,569 --> 01:03:04,435
- Boy!
- Yo, I heard you.

1310
01:03:04,529 --> 01:03:06,395
I'll do it without your help.

1311
01:03:07,615 --> 01:03:09,572
That's 75 cents.

1312
01:03:09,659 --> 01:03:10,740
- Thanks.
- Thanks, hon.

1313
01:03:11,453 --> 01:03:13,786
Sal! We're going to boycott
your fat pasta ass.

1314
01:03:13,872 --> 01:03:16,159
You're gonna boy...
You're going to boycott me?

1315
01:03:16,249 --> 01:03:18,662
You haven't got the balls to boycott me.

1316
01:03:18,752 --> 01:03:20,835
He's going to boycott me. Are you kidding?

1317
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:23,082
Get... Here's your...
Here! Here's your boycott.

1318
01:03:23,173 --> 01:03:25,256
Up your ass. You're going to boycott.

1319
01:03:25,342 --> 01:03:28,756
Here... Where you going?
Oh! Where you going?

1320
01:03:28,845 --> 01:03:31,053
- I'm talking to you, Pino!
- I'm right here.

1321
01:03:31,139 --> 01:03:33,973
All right, go inside.
I can take care of myself, all right?

1322
01:03:34,059 --> 01:03:36,120
- Take it easy, all right?
- No, I want you to go inside.

1323
01:03:36,144 --> 01:03:39,228
Here's your boycott! Up here!
Son of a bitch.

1324
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:42,432
Messed up my Jordans with muck.

1325
01:03:42,525 --> 01:03:45,939
Damn!

1326
01:03:46,029 --> 01:03:48,271
Get this thing straightened out, man.

1327
01:03:48,365 --> 01:03:51,733
White boy, black man.
I can't believe this crap.

1328
01:03:51,826 --> 01:03:54,239
- Ah, your Jordans are dogged!
- Oh, man! You, too?

1329
01:03:54,329 --> 01:03:55,991
- Well, stop.
- Yeah, me, too.

1330
01:03:56,081 --> 01:03:57,913
Oh, you hangin' out with baby sis.

1331
01:03:57,999 --> 01:03:59,786
Look, Buggin' Out, we're not hangin' out.

1332
01:03:59,876 --> 01:04:02,914
- She's escortin' me back to Sal's.
- Stop lying. That's not even true.

1333
01:04:03,004 --> 01:04:04,791
- I'm just goin' to get a slice.
- A slice?

1334
01:04:04,881 --> 01:04:06,964
Yo, yo, Jade, you can't do that.
Not today.

1335
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:09,963
You don't know this, but I'm organizing
a boycott of Sal's Famous.

1336
01:04:10,053 --> 01:04:11,589
Why? What'd he do?

1337
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:13,966
You know them pictures
he got on the wall of fame?

1338
01:04:14,057 --> 01:04:16,299
- So?
- So? Wake up.

1339
01:04:16,393 --> 01:04:19,886
- Don't you notice somethin' about them?
- No, Buggin' Out, I haven't.

1340
01:04:19,979 --> 01:04:22,847
You know, you're wasting my time.
Just leave that shit alone.

1341
01:04:22,941 --> 01:04:24,835
- You should. You really should.
- Hey, yo, Mook!

1342
01:04:24,859 --> 01:04:26,316
- I'm gone.
- I'll see you there.

1343
01:04:26,403 --> 01:04:27,519
Stay black, Mook.

1344
01:04:28,071 --> 01:04:30,358
- So, Buggin' Out, how you been?
- How I been?

1345
01:04:30,448 --> 01:04:32,656
Every single one of them pictures
is somebody Italian.

1346
01:04:33,618 --> 01:04:35,610
- And?
- And we want some black people up.

1347
01:04:35,703 --> 01:04:38,946
- So did you ask Sal?
- Yeah, I asked him.

1348
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:42,954
We don't want nobody in there,
nobody spending good money in Sal's,

1349
01:04:43,044 --> 01:04:45,252
until we get black motherfucking pictures
on that wall.

1350
01:04:45,338 --> 01:04:47,170
Buggin' Out,
what good is that gonna do, huh?

1351
01:04:48,091 --> 01:04:50,253
You know, if you really tried hard,
Buggin' Out,

1352
01:04:50,343 --> 01:04:52,613
you could direct your energies
in a more useful way, you know?

1353
01:04:52,637 --> 01:04:54,879
Jade, you got to be down.
What, you ain't down?

1354
01:04:54,973 --> 01:04:59,217
Yeah, Buggin' Out, I'm down, but I'm down
for something positive in the community.

1355
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:00,310
Are you down for that?

1356
01:05:00,395 --> 01:05:01,977
Jade.

1357
01:05:05,316 --> 01:05:07,524
Jade, I still love you anyway.

1358
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:10,353
Yeah, I still love you, too, Buggin' Out.

1359
01:05:10,447 --> 01:05:11,483
I'll see you later, man.

1360
01:05:11,573 --> 01:05:13,530
Later. Damn.

1361
01:05:15,076 --> 01:05:16,192
Man.

1362
01:05:17,871 --> 01:05:19,237
You're pushing it, Mookie.

1363
01:05:20,206 --> 01:05:21,367
You're really pushing it.

1364
01:05:22,834 --> 01:05:25,372
I don't pay you good money
to have you jerk me around.

1365
01:05:26,171 --> 01:05:27,982
Now, you keep it up,
you're gonna end up in the street

1366
01:05:28,006 --> 01:05:30,373
with the rest of your homeboys.

1367
01:05:32,177 --> 01:05:33,634
About time, Pop.

1368
01:05:40,101 --> 01:05:42,184
Jade.

1369
01:05:44,814 --> 01:05:46,055
- How you doin', Jade?
- Great.

1370
01:05:46,149 --> 01:05:49,062
- Where you been?
- Just working hard. Keeping busy.

1371
01:05:49,152 --> 01:05:50,893
- How's business going?
- Business is great.

1372
01:05:50,987 --> 01:05:53,821
We were wondering when you
were gonna stop by and pay us a visit.

1373
01:05:54,491 --> 01:05:57,780
- How's my brother doing?
- Well, he's, uh... Mookie is...

1374
01:05:58,244 --> 01:05:59,906
He's great. You know, he's a good kid.

1375
01:05:59,996 --> 01:06:02,033
- Hey, Pop. Stop lying.
- Thanks.

1376
01:06:02,123 --> 01:06:03,659
- He's only kidding, Jade.
- I know.

1377
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:05,912
- What can I fix you?
- Regular slice.

1378
01:06:06,002 --> 01:06:08,540
No, no, I'm going to make you
something special,

1379
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:10,232
something very special, if you don't mind.

1380
01:06:10,256 --> 01:06:12,418
Yeah, no, that'd be great.
That'd be great.

1381
01:06:12,509 --> 01:06:14,320
- Okay, what do you want to drink?
- Cream soda.

1382
01:06:14,344 --> 01:06:16,210
Changed, it used to be root beer.

1383
01:06:16,679 --> 01:06:18,090
If I'm wrong, tell me if I'm wrong.

1384
01:06:18,181 --> 01:06:20,138
I know. I want a change of pace, you know.

1385
01:06:21,768 --> 01:06:24,886
Hey, Vito, clean off the table for Jade,
okay?

1386
01:06:24,979 --> 01:06:26,186
All right, Pop.

1387
01:06:26,272 --> 01:06:28,685
Come here, Jade. Sit here.
This is the best booth.

Twenty C Energizers?

01:06:52,924 --> 01:06:55,041
D. Not C. D.

1395
01:06:55,134 --> 01:06:56,466

Twenty D fuckin' batteries.

Hey, wait. Yo, wait, wait, wait.

1405
01:07:18,783 --> 01:07:20,094
- What's the date on them, man?
- Motherfuck...

1406
01:07:20,118 --> 01:07:22,030
What's the date on them?

1407
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,533
- The date! The fuckin' date!
- What?

1408
01:07:24,622 --> 01:07:27,456
Can you fuckin' speak English? The date!

1409
01:07:27,542 --> 01:07:29,124
- Date?
- Date. Date.

1411
01:07:32,422 --> 01:07:34,024
- Motherfuck...
- What you talkin' about, Marcha?

1412
01:07:34,048 --> 01:07:35,048
1991.

1413
01:07:35,049 --> 01:07:38,793
Oh, March.
That's March, motherfucker, March.

1414
01:07:38,886 --> 01:07:40,923
Yo, man, you sure that's 20?

1415
01:07:41,014 --> 01:07:43,097
- Twenty.
- No, man. No, no, no. Take 'em out, man.

1416
01:07:43,433 --> 01:07:45,015
Count 'em again.

1417
01:07:45,101 --> 01:07:46,888
Count the shits again, man.

1418
01:07:46,978 --> 01:07:48,298
Motherfucker.

1419
01:08:08,583 --> 01:08:10,074
May I help you?

1420
01:08:12,003 --> 01:08:13,164
I want some flowers.

1421
01:08:14,047 --> 01:08:16,255
- The whole thing?
- The whole thing.

1422
01:08:17,258 --> 01:08:20,001
- It's very expensive.
- I know. I'll pay.

1423
01:08:40,823 --> 01:08:42,780
I thought you might like these.

1424
01:08:46,537 --> 01:08:47,653
I guess not.

1425
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:53,409
There is nothing
like the smell of fresh flowers.

1426
01:08:53,503 --> 01:08:54,994
Don't you agree, Mother Sister?

1427
01:08:57,256 --> 01:09:00,420
Summertime...
All you can smell is the garbage.

1428
01:09:01,427 --> 01:09:03,544
Smell overpowers everything,

1429
01:09:03,638 --> 01:09:06,506
especially
the soft, sweet smell of flowers.

1430
01:09:07,725 --> 01:09:09,591
You don't mind, I'm gonna sit right here,

1431
01:09:09,686 --> 01:09:12,804
catch myself a breeze or two,
and then I'll be on my way.

1432
01:09:15,525 --> 01:09:18,939
Thank the Lord, the sun is going down.

1433
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:22,897
It is hot as blazes.

1434
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:25,111
Yes, Jesus.

1435
01:09:25,201 --> 01:09:30,287
Well, guess I'll be on my way.

1436
01:09:48,516 --> 01:09:50,382
- Oh.
- Oh, goddamn, man!

1437
01:09:50,476 --> 01:09:52,217
Cut that shit down!

1438
01:09:52,311 --> 01:09:55,304
You should play some Bobby "Blue" Bland
or something, you fucker.

1439
01:09:55,398 --> 01:09:56,730
- What to say?
- Come on!

1440
01:09:56,816 --> 01:10:00,059
- Man, I don't know how he does it.
- Oh, man! Goddamn!

1441
01:10:00,153 --> 01:10:02,486
Loud-ass shit. Fuck.

1442
01:10:02,572 --> 01:10:03,938
- ML?
- What?

1443
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,863
- Come here.
- What?

1444
01:10:05,950 --> 01:10:08,158
Come hold this for me, baby.

1445
01:10:08,911 --> 01:10:13,372
- Yo...
- Hold what, sucker?

1446
01:10:13,458 --> 01:10:15,791
- You know what I'm talkin' about.
- That's okay.

1447
01:10:15,877 --> 01:10:19,917
At least my moms didn't name me
Sweet Dick Willie.

1448
01:10:20,006 --> 01:10:22,419
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.
- I told you about that "mama" shit.

1449
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:25,167
Hey, nobody talkin' about your moms.

1450
01:10:25,261 --> 01:10:27,127
I ain't say nobody, motherfucker.
I said you!

1451
01:10:27,221 --> 01:10:28,941
- Hey, hey.
- Come on, man, squash all that.

1452
01:10:28,973 --> 01:10:31,590
- Just squash that shit.
- No, Dick, listen.

1453
01:10:31,684 --> 01:10:34,222
- You know I didn't mean it like that.
- You did, too!

1454
01:10:34,312 --> 01:10:37,396
- Shit.
- I just wanted to know

1455
01:10:37,482 --> 01:10:40,099
who named you Sweet Dick Willie.

1456
01:10:40,193 --> 01:10:43,527
Man, it's just a name. Goddamn. Shit.

1457
01:10:43,613 --> 01:10:46,321
- How you get the name ML?
- Yeah! Uh-huh.

1458
01:10:46,407 --> 01:10:47,943
ML stands for ML.

1459
01:10:48,034 --> 01:10:50,526
Now that's some stupid shit, right there.

1460
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:52,987
You hear me? That's some stupid shit.

1461
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:55,868
'Cause everybody know
why they call me Sweet Dick Willie.

1462
01:10:55,958 --> 01:10:58,792
- Everybody.
- Boy, I swear, you Negroes kill me.

1463
01:10:58,878 --> 01:11:00,995
- Shit.
- Always holding onto,

1464
01:11:01,088 --> 01:11:03,250
always talking about your dicks.

1465
01:11:03,341 --> 01:11:06,175
See, I don't know about you,
but it's too hot to fuck.

1466
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:08,547
Man, you out your fuckin' mind?

1467
01:11:08,638 --> 01:11:11,472
It ain't never too hot
or never too cold for fuckin'.

1468
01:11:11,557 --> 01:11:16,018
Hear me? I had my best
piece of woman on a humid day.

1469
01:11:16,103 --> 01:11:17,247
- Shit.
- Ain't that something.

1470
01:11:17,271 --> 01:11:19,228
Over in the projects. Close to your woman.

1471
01:11:19,315 --> 01:11:21,648
Hey, boy, get out of here, man! Shit.

1472
01:11:21,734 --> 01:11:23,566
- Oh, Lord, have mercy.
- Oh, boy. Hey, boy.

1473
01:11:23,653 --> 01:11:26,612
Goddamn.
I better not see her naked on payday.

1474
01:11:26,739 --> 01:11:28,947
<i>Piraguero!</i> Everybody out!

1475
01:11:29,033 --> 01:11:31,275
The Icee, Icee Man is here.

1476
01:11:31,369 --> 01:11:34,612
Hey, hey! Looking good, looking good.

1477
01:11:34,705 --> 01:11:38,574
Here we are.
Look at these beautiful people, huh.

1478
01:11:38,668 --> 01:11:41,752
The Icee man is here. Ah, ah.

1479
01:11:41,838 --> 01:11:43,690
- I want coconut.
- Give me lemon.

1480
01:11:43,714 --> 01:11:45,580
Tell me what you need. Aha!

1481
01:11:45,675 --> 01:11:47,962
There you go, my love. There you go.

1482
01:11:48,052 --> 01:11:49,634
Aha, that's your color.

1483
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:51,040
- That's your flavor.
- Thank you.

1484
01:11:52,098 --> 01:11:53,964
I want more syrup on mine.

1485
01:11:56,686 --> 01:11:58,097
He's always drinking beer.

1486
01:12:02,483 --> 01:12:05,351
Hey, hey, now!
Hey, where's everybody going?

1487
01:12:05,444 --> 01:12:07,936
Ice cream!

1488
01:12:08,573 --> 01:12:09,984
- Ice cream!
- Doctor!

1489
01:12:15,788 --> 01:12:18,155
Doctor, don't you know no better

1490
01:12:18,249 --> 01:12:20,457
than to run out in that street
in front of a car?

1491
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:23,293
What you trying to do, kill yourself?

1492
01:12:24,005 --> 01:12:26,497
- Come on. Let's get up. Come on.
- Ah.

1493
01:12:28,009 --> 01:12:29,500
You gonna be all right.

1494
01:12:30,636 --> 01:12:32,923
You gonna be all right, my boy.

1495
01:12:33,014 --> 01:12:34,550
Eddie, you gonna be just fine.

1496
01:12:35,057 --> 01:12:37,344
Eddie, what's wrong?

1497
01:12:37,435 --> 01:12:38,971
Mayor knocked me down.

1498
01:12:39,645 --> 01:12:41,181
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

1499
01:12:41,272 --> 01:12:45,812
Miss, that boy's just scared to death.

1500
01:12:45,902 --> 01:12:47,234
What happened...

1501
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:49,733
I was walking along the street,
minding my own business.

1502
01:12:49,822 --> 01:12:52,906
I looked out and I seen your son
about to get hit by the car,

1503
01:12:52,992 --> 01:12:57,362
so I dashed out to save him,
and I had to knock him down

1504
01:12:57,455 --> 01:12:58,787
to keep us both from getting hit.

1505
01:12:58,873 --> 01:13:04,210
Matter of fact, I saved two lives today...
his and mine.

1506
01:13:05,129 --> 01:13:06,290
Eddie, is that the truth?

1507
01:13:07,882 --> 01:13:09,839
Eddie, you hear me talking to you.

1508
01:13:10,635 --> 01:13:11,778
Come on. I'm talking to you, boy.

1509
01:13:11,802 --> 01:13:13,919
He gonna be fine, miss. Just fine.

1510
01:13:15,097 --> 01:13:16,867
What'd I tell you about lying?

1511
01:13:16,891 --> 01:13:18,974
What'd I tell you?

1512
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:21,143
- Mommy, Mommy! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- Ease up!

1513
01:13:21,228 --> 01:13:22,764
Get upstairs, now!

1514
01:13:22,855 --> 01:13:25,973
And when your father come home,
he gonna wear your little behind out, too!

1515
01:13:26,067 --> 01:13:29,481
Miss, you didn't have
to hit your boy like that.

1516
01:13:30,571 --> 01:13:32,153
He's already scared to death.

1517
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:34,902
I appreciate you helping my Eddie,
I truly do.

1518
01:13:34,992 --> 01:13:37,200
But I'll have nobody question
how I raise him.

1519
01:13:37,286 --> 01:13:39,323
- Not even his daddy.
- You're right, miss.

1520
01:13:40,831 --> 01:13:42,163
You're right.

1521
01:13:43,042 --> 01:13:46,706
Excuse me.
I don't want to sound like a jerk.

1522
01:13:46,796 --> 01:13:49,709
- But can I say something here, Jade?
- Yeah, Sal.

1523
01:13:50,967 --> 01:13:53,459
You got the biggest eyes
I've ever seen in my life.

1524
01:13:53,552 --> 01:13:55,572
They, like, jump right out of your head.
You know that?

1525
01:13:55,596 --> 01:13:58,009
I feel embarrassed even saying that.
I feel like a jerk.

1526
01:13:58,849 --> 01:14:01,432
- Thanks, Sal. Thanks a lot.
- All right, don't even mention it.

1527
01:14:01,519 --> 01:14:03,636
It was delicious. Thanks a lot.

1528
01:14:03,729 --> 01:14:05,186
- I gotta talk to you.
- Mookie.

1529
01:14:06,023 --> 01:14:07,810
I got to talk to you. Come on, come on.

1530
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:10,017
- All right, Mookie.
- Come on. Let's go.

1531
01:14:10,695 --> 01:14:13,233
Hey, Jade, don't forget
to come back soon, okay?

1532
01:14:13,322 --> 01:14:15,564
Hey, Mookie, take it easy.
What are you grabbing her arm?

1533
01:14:15,658 --> 01:14:16,944
You're going to bust her arm.

1534
01:14:17,618 --> 01:14:18,779
Vito...

1535
01:14:24,166 --> 01:14:26,909
Jade, I do not want you
in Sal's no more, all right?

1536
01:14:27,003 --> 01:14:29,086
- Mookie, what? Stop tripping.
- No, you're trippin'.

1537
01:14:29,171 --> 01:14:31,128
Read my lips. Don't come in Sal's no more.

1538
01:14:31,215 --> 01:14:32,626
What are you so worked up about?

1539
01:14:32,717 --> 01:14:35,209
The way Sal looks at you.
About the way he talks at you.

1540
01:14:35,302 --> 01:14:36,964
- He's just being nice.
- Nice?

1541
01:14:37,054 --> 01:14:38,886
- He's completely innocent.
- Innocent?

1542
01:14:38,973 --> 01:14:40,384
I didn't stutter. You heard me.

1543
01:14:40,474 --> 01:14:42,761
Look, all Sal wants
to do is hide the salami.

1544
01:14:42,852 --> 01:14:44,764
You're really crude, Mookie.
You know that?

1545
01:14:44,854 --> 01:14:47,767
I admit it. I'm crude.
Do not come in Sal's anymore.

1546
01:14:47,857 --> 01:14:50,349
- You are not welcome.
- You got a lot of nerve, you know that?

1547
01:14:50,443 --> 01:14:52,730
I'm gonna tell you something
for the last time, Mookie.

1548
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:55,062
Stop trying to play
big brother to me, okay?

1549
01:14:55,156 --> 01:14:56,522
I'm a grown woman!

1550
01:14:56,615 --> 01:14:59,153
You can hardly pay rent,
and you're gonna tell me what to do?

1551
01:14:59,243 --> 01:15:01,360
- Come off it!
- That makes no sense at all.

1552
01:15:01,454 --> 01:15:02,820
- Oh, it doesn't, huh?
- No.

1553
01:15:02,913 --> 01:15:05,872
You got your little $250 a week,
plus tips.

1554
01:15:05,958 --> 01:15:08,120
- I'm getting paid.
- Peanuts.

1555
01:15:09,754 --> 01:15:11,916
You know, in a while,
I'll be making a move, all right?

1556
01:15:12,006 --> 01:15:14,089
- Yeah, when?
- Don't worry about it.

1557
01:15:14,175 --> 01:15:15,819
- When, Mookie? That's what I wanna...
- Don't worry about it.

1558
01:15:15,843 --> 01:15:17,300
- When?
- Don't worry about it.

1559
01:15:17,386 --> 01:15:19,489
- Jade, don't come here no more.
- Look, it's got nothing...

1560
01:15:19,513 --> 01:15:20,799
We're not talking about that.

1561
01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:22,701
Take your skinny butt
around the corner and go home.

1562
01:15:22,725 --> 01:15:24,161
I'm tired of supporting
a grown woman, okay?

1563
01:15:24,185 --> 01:15:25,287
Take your butt around the corner.

1564
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:27,268
I'm tired of supporting a grown man. Okay?

1565
01:15:27,354 --> 01:15:30,222
I wanna know when you're gonna
pack your bags and go, okay, Mookie?

1566
01:15:30,316 --> 01:15:32,085
Hey, just don't come in Sal's no more,
all right?

1567
01:15:32,109 --> 01:15:34,692
- I'll be back.
- And no more pizza, either.

1568
01:15:39,075 --> 01:15:42,364
I don't care if you fire me
this exact fucking moment.

1569
01:15:44,872 --> 01:15:46,600
If you're saying
what I'm thinking you're saying,

1570
01:15:46,624 --> 01:15:48,866
you better not say it
because I don't wanna hear.

1571
01:15:49,877 --> 01:15:53,496
Yeah, hear this. Do me a favor.
Leave Jade alone.

1572
01:15:54,924 --> 01:15:57,132
You know, Mookie, not for nothin',

1573
01:15:57,218 --> 01:16:00,006
but if you were just a little bit taller,

1574
01:16:00,096 --> 01:16:02,338
I'd kick you right in the ass
for what you're thinking.

1575
01:16:03,182 --> 01:16:06,892
As a matter of fact,
I should kick your ass on principle alone.

1576
01:16:06,977 --> 01:16:09,139
Here. You got a delivery.

1577
01:16:14,735 --> 01:16:16,226
This the right address?

1578
01:16:17,113 --> 01:16:20,026
Yeah, what is this with the...
Yeah, it's the right address, Mook.

1579
01:16:20,116 --> 01:16:22,608
That's the right address.
Yeah, I wrote it myself. Why?

1580
01:16:22,701 --> 01:16:24,442
I'm checking. Sometimes you make a mistake

1581
01:16:24,537 --> 01:16:27,371
and I deliver fucking pizzas
to the wrong fucking address.

1582
01:16:27,456 --> 01:16:29,072
I don't make mistakes. I don't make...

1583
01:16:29,166 --> 01:16:30,452
- You don't make mistakes?
- No.

1584
01:16:30,543 --> 01:16:34,253
Hey, hurry back, okay?
Don't get lost. We're still open.

1585
01:16:34,338 --> 01:16:36,500
Do me a favor. Make the pizza, huh?

1586
01:16:43,722 --> 01:16:44,722
Mr. Mayor.

1587
01:16:47,393 --> 01:16:49,885
I saw what you did.
That was a foolish act.

1588
01:16:50,688 --> 01:16:52,350
But it was brave.

1589
01:16:52,439 --> 01:16:55,432
- That child owes you his life.
- I wasn't trying to be a hero.

1590
01:16:55,526 --> 01:16:58,064
I just seen what was happening,
and I reacted.

1591
01:16:58,154 --> 01:17:00,362
Didn't even think.

1592
01:17:00,447 --> 01:17:03,051
Probably wouldn't have done it
on second thought, if I had thought.

1593
01:17:03,075 --> 01:17:05,488
Yeah, Da Mayor's getting to be
an old man, now.

1594
01:17:05,578 --> 01:17:08,286
I ain't run like that in years.

1595
01:17:08,372 --> 01:17:11,365
I went from first to home
on a bunt single.

1596
01:17:11,458 --> 01:17:14,747
Scored the winning run.
It was two out in the bottom of the ninth.

1597
01:17:14,837 --> 01:17:18,080
It was August 1, 1939. Snow Hill, Alabama.

1598
01:17:18,174 --> 01:17:20,757
Ol' Mud Cat Bunch-of-Bones
was the pitcher.

1599
01:17:20,843 --> 01:17:22,129
Now, he hated my guts.

1600
01:17:22,219 --> 01:17:26,680
He ran back, come down off that mound,
and I took off

1601
01:17:26,765 --> 01:17:30,054
like white lightning
up a black snake's ass, I...

1602
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,182
Maybe I, uh...

1603
01:17:33,272 --> 01:17:35,639
Maybe I ought to be
a hero more often, huh?

1604
01:17:35,733 --> 01:17:37,565
Maybe you shouldn't.

1605
01:17:37,651 --> 01:17:38,687
Don't get happy.

1606
01:17:38,986 --> 01:17:40,978
This changes nothing between you and me.

1607
01:17:41,071 --> 01:17:45,190
You did a good thing, and Mother Sister
just wanted to thank you for it.

1608
01:17:45,284 --> 01:17:46,616
I want to thank you.

1609
01:17:47,494 --> 01:17:49,201
You're welcome.

1610
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:02,082
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.

1611
01:18:02,176 --> 01:18:04,008
What the hell took you so long? Is it hot?

1612
01:18:04,094 --> 01:18:06,507
Lady, I've never delivered a cold pizza
in my life.

1613
01:18:16,607 --> 01:18:18,018
Come here.

1614
01:18:25,950 --> 01:18:27,385
You know, you think you're slick, Tina.

1615
01:18:27,409 --> 01:18:29,196
I know.
How else was I gonna get you up here?

1616
01:18:29,286 --> 01:18:30,868
I haven't seen you for a week.

1617
01:18:30,955 --> 01:18:33,413
I'm working, you know.
Making money, getting paid.

1618
01:18:33,499 --> 01:18:35,832
I see you forgot the ice cream again.

1619
01:18:36,252 --> 01:18:37,493
Ah, shit, I forgot.

1620
01:18:37,586 --> 01:18:39,953
Yeah, you know,
your memory's getting really ridiculous.

1621
01:18:40,047 --> 01:18:42,192
- It's disgusting.
- I forgot. I got things on my mind.

1622
01:18:42,216 --> 01:18:44,082
Yeah,
and I really wanted some ice cream, too.

1623
01:18:44,176 --> 01:18:46,279
It'll make you any happier,
I'll run out and get some.

1624
01:18:46,303 --> 01:18:49,262
No, no, no. That's out.
You won't come back, either.

1625
01:18:49,932 --> 01:18:52,470
- You know, I can't be staying long anyhow.
- How long?

1626
01:18:53,269 --> 01:18:55,010
- Long enough to do the nasty.
- Ahh!

1627
01:18:55,104 --> 01:18:58,643
No, come on, Mookie! That's out.
Hold up. Wait a minute.

1628
01:18:58,732 --> 01:19:00,724
First of all, it is too hot, all right?

1629
01:19:00,818 --> 01:19:02,559
And if you think I'm gonna
let you get some,

1630
01:19:02,653 --> 01:19:04,770
put your clothes on and leave here

1631
01:19:04,863 --> 01:19:06,855
and not see your black ass
for another week,

1632
01:19:06,949 --> 01:19:09,487
- you must be bugging.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

1633
01:19:09,576 --> 01:19:11,442
Yeah, right.
And my name is Boo Boo the Fool.

1634
01:19:11,537 --> 01:19:13,119
So no nasty, huh?

1635
01:19:13,789 --> 01:19:15,872
- No.
- Tina, let's do something else, then.

1636
01:19:15,958 --> 01:19:17,790
- What?
- Trust me.

1637
01:19:17,876 --> 01:19:20,084
Trust you?
Uh, Mookie, the last time I trusted you,

1638
01:19:20,170 --> 01:19:21,286
we ended up with a son.

1639
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:24,088
- Remember your son?
- I do remember my son. His name's Hector.

1640
01:19:24,174 --> 01:19:25,934
What are you trying to say?
I'm a bad father?

1641
01:19:26,343 --> 01:19:27,343
On the strength.

1642
01:19:27,886 --> 01:19:30,424
- Let me talk to you for a second.
- What? What?

1643
01:19:30,514 --> 01:19:31,514
Over here.

1644
01:19:34,935 --> 01:19:37,518
Tina... take your clothes off.

1645
01:19:38,731 --> 01:19:42,475
Mookie, I already told you
it's too fuckin' hot to make love.

1646
01:19:42,568 --> 01:19:43,854
- It's too fuckin' hot.
- Yeah.

1647
01:19:43,944 --> 01:19:46,256
- Why are you always cursing?
- I don't fuckin' curse that much.

1648
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:47,737
"I don't fuckin' curse that much."

1649
01:19:47,823 --> 01:19:49,217
What the hell are you talking about,
Mookie?

1650
01:19:49,241 --> 01:19:50,857
- All you do is curse.
- I do not!

1651
01:19:50,951 --> 01:19:54,115
Anyway, no rawness
is jumping off tonight, all right?

1652
01:19:54,204 --> 01:19:56,070
And that's it.

1653
01:19:56,165 --> 01:19:58,703
- No rawness?
- No. No rawness.

1654
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:02,640
Why it's always gotta be like that
when you come over here and shit?

1655
01:20:02,671 --> 01:20:05,358
- It's not always like that.
- It always has to be fuckin' like that...

1656
01:20:05,382 --> 01:20:07,749
Mookie, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

1657
01:20:07,843 --> 01:20:08,959
I'm not cursing.

1658
01:20:09,053 --> 01:20:12,091
Mookie. Come on!

1659
01:20:12,181 --> 01:20:14,218
I mean it. I'm not playing.

1660
01:20:14,308 --> 01:20:16,721
"I'm not playing."

1661
01:20:18,771 --> 01:20:20,854
Damn, don't be so anxious.

1662
01:20:23,567 --> 01:20:25,775
That's right. Take it off.

1663
01:20:32,076 --> 01:20:34,989
- You're sweating.
- Of course I'm sweating, you moron.

1664
01:20:35,079 --> 01:20:37,036
It's only 100 degrees in here and shit.

1665
01:20:38,415 --> 01:20:41,999
Look, freeze. Don't move.
I'll be right back, okay?

1666
01:20:42,086 --> 01:20:44,105
- What do you mean you'll be right back?
- Just stay there.

1667
01:20:44,129 --> 01:20:45,210
Where you going?

1668
01:20:46,048 --> 01:20:47,084
I'll be right back.

1669
01:20:47,174 --> 01:20:48,943
What the hell you got me
standing on the bed for?

1670
01:20:48,967 --> 01:20:50,299
Where the hell you going?

1671
01:20:55,182 --> 01:20:56,969
How's my son, Hector?

1672
01:20:57,935 --> 01:21:02,270
Honey, do you hear that?
He wants to know how you are doing.

1673
01:21:02,356 --> 01:21:05,770
And he has the straight face
of asking about it.

1674
01:21:08,821 --> 01:21:10,403
Good for nothing.

1675
01:21:15,536 --> 01:21:17,027
English! English!

1676
01:21:17,121 --> 01:21:18,987
I want my son to speak English, all right?

1677
01:21:19,081 --> 01:21:22,281
- Why don't you just get out of my kitchen?
- It's bad enough his name is Hector.

1678
01:21:22,835 --> 01:21:25,703
Get out of my kitchen.
I don't want to hear anything.

1679
01:21:26,296 --> 01:21:29,209
Get out. Out, I said.

1680
01:21:31,718 --> 01:21:33,380
Yes, children.

1681
01:21:33,470 --> 01:21:36,258
This is the cool-out corner.

1682
01:21:37,099 --> 01:21:41,810
We're slowing it down
for all the lovers in the house.

1683
01:21:42,646 --> 01:21:45,514
I'll be giving you all the help you need.

1684
01:21:45,607 --> 01:21:47,564
Musically, that is.

1685
01:21:47,651 --> 01:21:49,267
This shit is cold.

1686
01:21:49,361 --> 01:21:51,068
Supposed to be cold. It's an ice cube.

1687
01:21:51,155 --> 01:21:52,566
Later for your shit.

1688
01:21:53,282 --> 01:21:54,398
<i>Mira.</i>

1689
01:21:55,617 --> 01:21:56,949
<i>- Mira.</i>
- What?

1690
01:21:58,245 --> 01:22:01,283
Tina, you don't got a forehead.
You got a eight-head.

1691
01:22:01,373 --> 01:22:03,831
Mookie, you're corny as shit.

1692
01:22:03,917 --> 01:22:05,749
You got one of them Sade foreheads.

1693
01:22:05,836 --> 01:22:07,543
Fuck you.

1694
01:22:07,629 --> 01:22:10,246
Goddamn, that's a big-ass forehead.

1695
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:12,172
I need an iceberg...

1696
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:17,257
It'd be better than this ice cube.

1697
01:22:18,849 --> 01:22:20,465
Thank God for the lips.

1698
01:22:22,853 --> 01:22:24,594
Thank God for the neck.

1699
01:22:27,149 --> 01:22:29,311
Thank God for kneecaps.

1700
01:22:32,029 --> 01:22:33,895
Thank God for elbows.

1701
01:22:35,699 --> 01:22:37,986
Thank God for thighs.

1702
01:22:40,621 --> 01:22:42,283
Thank God for the right nipple.

1703
01:22:44,208 --> 01:22:46,200
Thank God for the left nipple.

1704
01:22:46,585 --> 01:22:48,292
Feels good.

1705
01:22:48,378 --> 01:22:50,995
Ah. You likes, you likes, you likes.

1706
01:22:51,089 --> 01:22:52,921
Anyway.

1707
01:22:54,176 --> 01:22:56,384
I got to be going.

1708
01:22:56,470 --> 01:22:57,586
You better come back.

1709
01:22:57,679 --> 01:22:59,090
I'll be back tonight.

1710
01:22:59,181 --> 01:23:01,301
You better come back,
or else I'm gonna kick your ass.

1711
01:23:02,309 --> 01:23:03,675
- Oops.
- What?

1712
01:23:03,769 --> 01:23:05,761
Guess I got to be back then.

1713
01:23:05,854 --> 01:23:07,095
All right.

1714
01:23:09,191 --> 01:23:10,477
All right.

1715
01:23:11,568 --> 01:23:13,184
All right.

1716
01:23:14,154 --> 01:23:16,146
- Get out of here.
- I gotta go.

1717
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:17,776
- Bye.
- Bye.

1718
01:23:24,748 --> 01:23:28,082
- I'm not leaving yet.
- Get out of here.

1719
01:23:28,168 --> 01:23:30,581
- All right. Later.
- Later.

1720
01:23:33,215 --> 01:23:36,424
So just out of curiosity,
how long you gonna stick around here?

1721
01:23:36,510 --> 01:23:37,921
You mean tonight?

1722
01:23:38,011 --> 01:23:39,627
I mean the neighborhood, you know.

1723
01:23:39,721 --> 01:23:41,713
Well, I figure about 50 years.

1724
01:23:41,807 --> 01:23:44,327
Yeah, because I'm going into
the real estate business, you know.

1725
01:23:44,935 --> 01:23:47,348
I figured I'd put up a big high-rise
in the neighborhood.

1726
01:23:48,146 --> 01:23:50,684
- Yeah. Lot of people want to move here.
- Why not?

1727
01:23:51,525 --> 01:23:52,766
You want a condominium?

1728
01:23:52,859 --> 01:23:54,420
Put a couple of straws in there,
Mr. Trump.

1729
01:23:54,444 --> 01:23:56,481
- But of course.
- Mr. Trump's.

1730
01:23:56,572 --> 01:23:58,438
- Trump's Pizza.
- I heard of that place, man.

1731
01:23:58,532 --> 01:23:59,592
- No, it's Trump's Plaza.
- Oh.

1732
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:01,219
- Do me a favor. Get out of here.
- See you, Sal.

1733
01:24:01,243 --> 01:24:02,859
Take care, Salvatore.

1734
01:24:02,953 --> 01:24:07,243
Pino, take the soft drinks
out of the back and load up here, okay?

1735
01:24:07,332 --> 01:24:08,573
Okay, Pop.

1736
01:24:10,335 --> 01:24:12,042
Sal, if you want me to deliver faster,

1737
01:24:12,129 --> 01:24:13,731
you gotta give me
a jet rocket or something.

1738
01:24:13,755 --> 01:24:16,998
'Cause I can't be running with pizzas.
The cheese ends up on one side.

1739
01:24:17,092 --> 01:24:18,958
Mookie, I didn't say nothing.

1740
01:24:19,052 --> 01:24:21,760
You must have a guilty conscience.
You got a guilty conscience?

1741
01:24:21,847 --> 01:24:23,554
Sal, I'm not guilty of anything.

1742
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:24,951
You gotta be guilty of something.

1743
01:24:24,975 --> 01:24:27,558
Otherwise you wouldn't come in here
saying the things you said.

1744
01:24:27,644 --> 01:24:28,725
Come on, Sal.

1745
01:24:28,812 --> 01:24:30,428
Where we going?

1746
01:24:30,522 --> 01:24:31,763
Oh, shit.

1747
01:24:32,649 --> 01:24:34,168
- You're corny.
- Vito, give me a hand. Come on.

1748
01:24:34,192 --> 01:24:35,558
Corny as shit.

1749
01:24:38,739 --> 01:24:40,321
- Come on, Vito.
- What?

1750
01:24:40,407 --> 01:24:42,023
What the fuck's the matter?

1751
01:24:46,997 --> 01:24:49,614
Vito, I want you to listen to me.
I'm your brother.

1752
01:24:49,708 --> 01:24:51,870
I may smack you around
every once in a while,

1753
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:54,873
but I'm still your... your brother.

1754
01:24:56,298 --> 01:24:58,381
So what, Pino? So fucking what?

1755
01:25:00,886 --> 01:25:02,502
I love you, man.

1756
01:25:04,181 --> 01:25:05,638
I'm listening, I'm listening.

1757
01:25:05,724 --> 01:25:07,932
Good, 'cause I want you to listen.

1758
01:25:08,018 --> 01:25:10,260
Jesus Christ, Pino.
I said I'm fuckin' listening.

1759
01:25:10,354 --> 01:25:13,973
Good. Vito, black, white. No.

1760
01:25:14,066 --> 01:25:16,683
- No, no, no.
- No?

1761
01:25:16,777 --> 01:25:18,796
- What the hell you talking about?
- Are you listening to me?

1762
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:20,061
Stop busting my balls, Pino.

1763
01:25:20,155 --> 01:25:22,397
I said I'm fuckin' listening
ten fuckin' times already.

1764
01:25:22,491 --> 01:25:24,107
Mookie is not to be trusted.

1765
01:25:24,201 --> 01:25:25,720
- I trust him, Pino. I fuckin' trust him.
- No, no.

1766
01:25:25,744 --> 01:25:27,736
No <i>mulignan</i> can be trusted.

1767
01:25:27,829 --> 01:25:30,367
The first time you turn your back, boom.

1768
01:25:30,457 --> 01:25:32,540
The spear, right here, man, in the back.

1769
01:25:32,626 --> 01:25:34,959
Yeah? How do you know this?

1770
01:25:35,045 --> 01:25:37,162
- I know.
- How do you know, man?

1771
01:25:37,255 --> 01:25:39,463
- I know. I read.
- Give me a break, Pino.

1772
01:25:39,549 --> 01:25:41,486
I never seen you read nothing
in your fuckin' life.

1773
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:43,376
Read your history.

1774
01:25:43,470 --> 01:25:44,927
It's historical.

1775
01:25:45,013 --> 01:25:46,800
He, them, they're not to be trusted.

1776
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:50,010
- What do you want me to do about it?
- I want you to be on fucking guard, man.

1777
01:25:50,102 --> 01:25:51,764
Fuckin' hit me?

1778
01:25:51,853 --> 01:25:53,890
You be on guard,
'cause Mookie has Pop conned,

1779
01:25:53,980 --> 01:25:55,596
so we got to look out for him.

1780
01:25:56,441 --> 01:25:58,252
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

1781
01:25:58,276 --> 01:25:59,938
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

1782
01:26:00,028 --> 01:26:02,941
- Yeah?
- Vito! Pino! Let's go!

1783
01:26:03,031 --> 01:26:04,738
We'll be right there, Pop.

1784
01:26:04,825 --> 01:26:06,532
One minute.

1785
01:26:06,618 --> 01:26:10,032
You better listen to what I say
or I'll rip you...

1786
01:26:10,122 --> 01:26:12,284
I'll fuck you up.
You know I'll fuck you up.

1787
01:26:14,584 --> 01:26:16,291
- You know something, Pino?
- What?

1788
01:26:17,212 --> 01:26:19,065
You don't know everything
you think you know, man.

1789
01:26:19,089 --> 01:26:20,692
You think you know it,
but you don't know it.

1790
01:26:20,716 --> 01:26:23,550
Mookie, he listens to me. You don't, man.

1791
01:26:24,344 --> 01:26:26,882
He does, man. You fuckin' don't.

1792
01:26:29,224 --> 01:26:31,682
You're fuckin' stabbing me
in the back, man.

1793
01:26:42,154 --> 01:26:43,315
Radio!

1794
01:26:43,405 --> 01:26:44,941
Buggin', what's up?

1795
01:26:45,031 --> 01:26:46,317
How you been, man?

1796
01:26:46,408 --> 01:26:47,649
Living large, bro.

1797
01:26:49,411 --> 01:26:51,152
Yo, that the only tape you gots?

1798
01:26:51,246 --> 01:26:54,114
You don't like Public Enemy, man?
The shit's dope.

1799
01:26:54,207 --> 01:26:56,790
No, I'm down,
but you don't be playing nothing else.

1800
01:26:56,877 --> 01:26:58,914
I don't like nothing else.

1801
01:26:59,004 --> 01:27:01,462
Yo, check this, man. You know Sal?

1802
01:27:01,548 --> 01:27:03,631
Yeah, I know that motherfucker.

1803
01:27:03,717 --> 01:27:07,176
I've been trying to organize a boycott of
Sal's Famous, you know what I'm sayin'?

1804
01:27:07,262 --> 01:27:09,879
I almost had to bust him
in the head today, man.

1805
01:27:09,973 --> 01:27:15,014
Gonna tell me... Tell me, Radio Raheem,
to turn down my box and shit, man,

1806
01:27:15,103 --> 01:27:17,265
and didn't even say "please."

1807
01:27:17,355 --> 01:27:20,223
Who the fuck he think he is,
Don Corleone and shit?

1808
01:27:21,443 --> 01:27:23,400
He makes much money off us black people,

1809
01:27:23,487 --> 01:27:25,487
and all he got up in there on the wall
is Italians.

1810
01:27:25,572 --> 01:27:28,440
You know, Sylvester Stallone,
okeydoke-lookin' motherfuckers.

1811
01:27:28,533 --> 01:27:30,178
- You see what I'm saying, homeboy?
- On the strength.

1812
01:27:30,202 --> 01:27:33,695
Yeah, well we shouldn't buy one slice,
spend one red penny up in there

1813
01:27:33,789 --> 01:27:36,076
till he put folks of color
up on that wall.

1814
01:27:36,166 --> 01:27:38,374
That's what I'm talking about, man!

1815
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:40,326
- Yo, you got my back?
- Your back is got.

1816
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:42,252
- My brother.
- My brother.

1817
01:27:42,881 --> 01:27:44,417
Yo, Smiley. Come here, man.

1818
01:27:45,342 --> 01:27:46,708
What you listening to?

1819
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:51,588
M-M-M-Malcolm.

1820
01:27:51,681 --> 01:27:52,842
M-M-M-Malcolm, huh?

1821
01:27:52,933 --> 01:27:54,674
Cut off that rap music!

1822
01:27:54,768 --> 01:27:58,136
I'm in here trying to get me
some motherfuckin' goddamn sleep.

1823
01:27:58,230 --> 01:28:00,313
- Yo, I'll fuck you up quick!
- Two times!

1824
01:28:00,398 --> 01:28:05,439
Th-Th-Th-three t-times!

1825
01:28:07,072 --> 01:28:10,782
Sal, start counting my money tonight
'cause I gots to get paid.

1826
01:28:15,121 --> 01:28:16,953
Come on, Vito. Come on.

1827
01:28:24,089 --> 01:28:25,625
This is terrific.

1828
01:28:26,424 --> 01:28:28,882
I mean we had a great, great day.

1829
01:28:30,262 --> 01:28:31,798
You know something?

1830
01:28:33,265 --> 01:28:36,884
There's nothing like a family
in business working together.

1831
01:28:38,103 --> 01:28:39,890
I'm gonna rename the place.

1832
01:28:40,981 --> 01:28:44,474
I'm going to call it
Sal and Sons' Famous Pizzeria.

1833
01:28:45,986 --> 01:28:48,506
Why not? You guys are gonna
take it over someday, anyway, right?

1834
01:28:50,949 --> 01:28:52,485
And, Mookie...

1835
01:28:54,578 --> 01:28:57,696
Mookie, I want to tell you that there's
always gonna be a place for you here,

1836
01:28:57,789 --> 01:29:01,078
right here at Sal's,
Sal's Famous Pizzeria.

1837
01:29:01,710 --> 01:29:03,312
Because you've always
been like a son to me.

1838
01:29:03,336 --> 01:29:05,565
Yo, Sal! Can we get some pizza, man?

1839
01:29:05,589 --> 01:29:08,332
We're closed, man! We're closed.

1840
01:29:08,425 --> 01:29:10,963
- You shut up!
- Shut the fuck up, man!

1841
01:29:12,429 --> 01:29:14,136
All right, let them in. Let them in.

1842
01:29:14,222 --> 01:29:15,838
They love my pizza.

1843
01:29:15,932 --> 01:29:17,594
Four slices, and I'm out of here.

1844
01:29:17,684 --> 01:29:18,925
Sal, we're trying to go home!

1845
01:29:19,019 --> 01:29:20,476
- Open the door, Mookie!
- Shut up!

1846
01:29:20,562 --> 01:29:22,724
You ain't nothing
but a delivery boy, bitch!

1847
01:29:23,064 --> 01:29:24,350
- Simple ass!
- Stupid!

1848
01:29:26,526 --> 01:29:27,733
Man, shut the fuck up!

1849
01:29:27,819 --> 01:29:30,172
- Sit your black ass down!
- Shut up, man! Fuck you!

1850
01:29:30,196 --> 01:29:32,654
Yo, Sal, Sal, four slices, man, regular.

1851
01:29:32,741 --> 01:29:35,484
- To go, all right?
- Hey, why you gotta curse?

1852
01:29:35,577 --> 01:29:36,818
Looking good.

1853
01:29:36,912 --> 01:29:39,700
- Looking real good, man.
- Fuck it, man. Come on. I'm hungry, man.

- What about them pictures?
- What the fuck? Are you deaf?

No! Are you? Fuck you!

1865
01:30:07,692 --> 01:30:08,972
We're trying to go fucking home!

1866
01:30:09,027 --> 01:30:11,235
We've been here all fuckin' day,
Buggin' Out.

1867
01:30:11,321 --> 01:30:13,904
Turn that jungle music off!
We ain't in Africa!

1868
01:30:13,990 --> 01:30:15,652
Why it got to be about jungle music?

1869
01:30:15,742 --> 01:30:17,779
Why it got to be about Africa?

1870
01:30:17,869 --> 01:30:20,486
It's about them fucking pictures!

1871
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:24,369
It's about turning that shit off
and getting the fuck out of my place!

1872
01:30:24,459 --> 01:30:25,495
Radio Raheem!

1873
01:30:25,585 --> 01:30:27,827

1875
01:30:30,548 --> 01:30:32,961
This is music! My music!

1876
01:30:33,051 --> 01:30:34,337
Fuck your music!

1877
01:30:35,553 --> 01:30:36,964
Well, turn it off, then!

1878
01:30:37,055 --> 01:30:39,718
Hey, man, get the fuck out of here!
We're fuckin' closed!

1879
01:30:39,808 --> 01:30:41,140
Fuck you!

1880
01:30:41,226 --> 01:30:44,344
We're closing you
guinea bastards for good!

1881
01:30:44,437 --> 01:30:46,144
For good, motherfucker!

1882
01:30:46,231 --> 01:30:50,316
Until you get some black people
on that motherfucking wall of fame!

1883
01:30:50,402 --> 01:30:52,860
- You're gonna fucking close me?

I'll fuckin' tear your fuckin' nigger ass!

1886
01:30:58,493 --> 01:31:00,234
- Niggers?
- Oh, we're niggers now?

1887
01:31:00,328 --> 01:31:01,910
- We niggers now.
- I will fuck you up!

1888
01:31:01,997 --> 01:31:03,579
You fucking white trash!

1889
01:31:03,665 --> 01:31:05,076
Come here. I'll fuck you up!

1890
01:31:05,166 --> 01:31:07,453
Sal, put the fucking bat down!

1891
01:31:07,544 --> 01:31:10,878
- Come on, Ahmad!

1892
01:31:10,964 --> 01:31:12,455
Open the motherfucking counter!

1893
01:31:12,549 --> 01:31:14,882
You black cocksucker!

1894
01:31:14,968 --> 01:31:17,301
You nigger motherfucker!

1895
01:31:57,093 --> 01:31:59,881
I just killed your fucking radio.

1896
01:32:06,019 --> 01:32:08,352
My music! You motherfucking...

1897
01:32:09,272 --> 01:32:11,264
Lay off, you motherfuck!

01:32:24,662 --> 01:32:26,057
- Yo, yo, yo, stop!
- Please, stop it!

1904
01:32:26,081 --> 01:32:28,289
You don't fuck with my box, man!

1905
01:32:29,125 --> 01:32:31,333
Look at that.
Punch him in the grill right now!

1906
01:32:32,670 --> 01:32:35,583
- You don't fuck up my box!

1912
01:33:01,783 --> 01:33:03,149
Mookie!

1913
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:17,087
Hey! Break it up!

1914
01:33:17,173 --> 01:33:20,007
Hey! Hey! Break it up!

1915
01:33:20,093 --> 01:33:22,050
- He's gonna kill him.

1916
01:33:22,137 --> 01:33:23,489
What are you doing? You're gonna kill him!

1917
01:33:23,513 --> 01:33:25,721

01:33:25,807 --> 01:33:26,843
Stop!

1920
01:33:36,818 --> 01:33:37,854
Let me at 'em.

01:33:37,944 --> 01:33:39,810
Let me at 'em, man!

1922
01:33:39,904 --> 01:33:42,647

01:33:43,324 --> 01:33:44,385
Break it up, right now!

1924
01:33:44,409 --> 01:33:47,447
- Get off! Get off him, get off me!
- Let me through! Let me through!

1925
01:33:47,537 --> 01:33:48,698
Gary, get the big guy!

1926
01:33:48,788 --> 01:33:49,995
- Let me through!

1927
01:33:50,081 --> 01:33:51,081
Get off me!

1928
01:33:51,166 --> 01:33:53,453
I'll kill you, you motherfucker!

1929
01:33:53,543 --> 01:33:55,205
Just take him off me!

1930
01:33:55,295 --> 01:33:56,536
Get over here.

1931
01:33:56,629 --> 01:33:58,746
What are you doing? Sal!

You ain't taking Vito or Pino or Sal, huh?

Get the fuck off me!

1937

Let's get him out of here.

1961
01:35:04,030 --> 01:35:06,989
I'm a black man, goddamn it!
I'm a black man!

1962
01:35:07,075 --> 01:35:09,533
You can't kill us all!
You can't kill us all!

01:35:09,619 --> 01:35:11,485
You can't fucking kill us all, goddamn it!

01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:37,268
Back off, back off! Everybody, back off!

1976
01:35:44,153 --> 01:35:45,894
- I'm gonna fuck you up! Damn it!
- Shut up!

1977
01:35:45,989 --> 01:35:48,276
I told you to shut up!

1978
01:35:48,366 --> 01:35:50,483
- Back off!
- Radio, Radio, can you hear me, man?

1979
01:35:50,660 --> 01:35:52,276
- Radio!
- Back off!

1980
01:35:52,370 --> 01:35:55,363
This ain't even right, man.
Yo, what happened to rights?

1981
01:35:55,456 --> 01:35:56,992
I'm gonna get your back, man.

1982
01:35:57,417 --> 01:36:00,000
Yo, get him out!

1983
01:36:00,086 --> 01:36:01,293
- Fuck that, man!
- Bitch!

1984
01:36:01,963 --> 01:36:04,922
Radio!

1985
01:36:13,099 --> 01:36:14,635
No!

1986
01:36:19,147 --> 01:36:20,683
No!

1987
01:36:23,568 --> 01:36:25,935
Mookie, they killed him.

1988
01:36:26,029 --> 01:36:27,736
They killed Radio Raheem!

1989
01:36:27,822 --> 01:36:28,903
It's murder.

1990
01:36:28,990 --> 01:36:30,718
They did it again,
just like Michael Stewart.

1991
01:36:30,742 --> 01:36:32,904
Murder! Eleanor Bumpers! Murder!

1992
01:36:32,994 --> 01:36:35,953
Damn, man! It ain't safe
in our own fucking neighborhood!

1993
01:36:36,039 --> 01:36:38,076
Never was. Never will be.

1994
01:36:38,666 --> 01:36:40,978
We ain't gonna stand for this shit
no more, Sal. You hear me?

1995
01:36:41,002 --> 01:36:44,040
Ain't gonna stand for them fuckin' police.
Punk!

1996
01:36:45,131 --> 01:36:46,793
It's as plain as day.

1997
01:36:47,675 --> 01:36:50,133
They didn't have to kill the boy.

1998
01:36:50,219 --> 01:36:54,259
They killed him.

1999
01:36:59,103 --> 01:37:01,766
You ain't shit, Sal. Shit, man.

2000
01:37:17,747 --> 01:37:19,113
You do what you gotta do.

2001
01:37:19,207 --> 01:37:20,743
Aw, fuck that, Sal!

2002
01:37:20,833 --> 01:37:23,917
Listen, listen, listen.
Good people, please.

2003
01:37:24,003 --> 01:37:25,995
Let's all go home.
Somebody's gonna get hurt.

2004
01:37:26,089 --> 01:37:27,671
Yeah. You, boy!

2005
01:37:27,757 --> 01:37:30,841
If we don't stop this and stop it now,

2006
01:37:30,927 --> 01:37:34,216
we gonna do something we're gonna regret
for the rest of our lives.

2007
01:37:34,305 --> 01:37:37,298
Sal and his boys had nothing to do
with what the cops did.

2008
01:37:37,392 --> 01:37:40,931
One of the police was black!

2009
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:42,414
- Leave him alone.
- I'm gonna get you

2010
01:37:42,438 --> 01:37:44,600
and them three stooges, Sal, you hear me?

2011
01:37:44,690 --> 01:37:45,976
Go on, Mr. Sal.

2012
01:37:46,067 --> 01:37:48,309
- How'd you do it, man?
- Go on.

2013
01:37:48,403 --> 01:37:50,203
You see how they had him
in a choke hold, man?

2014
01:37:50,279 --> 01:37:52,396
I knew that choke hold
was killing people, man!

2015
01:37:52,490 --> 01:37:54,009
- This ain't no kid, man.
- He had a radio.

2016
01:37:54,033 --> 01:37:56,821
- You can't save him.
- He had a radio, a fucking radio!

2017
01:37:56,911 --> 01:37:58,618
He died because he had a radio!

2018
01:37:58,704 --> 01:38:01,117
All he wanted pictures on the wall,
and he died!

2019
01:38:01,207 --> 01:38:03,699
Sal, what you got to say, Sal?

2020
01:38:05,795 --> 01:38:07,912
...called the cops!

2021
01:38:08,005 --> 01:38:09,121
Vito called the cops!

2022
01:38:10,842 --> 01:38:12,299
Your son called the cops, boy!

2023
01:38:12,385 --> 01:38:14,627
Man, get the fuck out of here, man!

2024
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:16,177
Somebody's gotta pay.

2025
01:38:16,806 --> 01:38:18,547
Fuck that, man!

2026
01:38:24,647 --> 01:38:25,647
Aw, shit.

2027
01:38:28,651 --> 01:38:29,858
Hate!

2028
01:38:29,944 --> 01:38:31,480
No!

2029
01:38:37,577 --> 01:38:40,911
Let him go! Let him go!
Sal, this is Da Mayor.

2030
01:39:11,569 --> 01:39:13,060
- What are they doing?
- Come on, Sal.

2031
01:39:13,154 --> 01:39:14,673
- What are they doing?
- Sal, Sal, Sal.

2032
01:39:14,697 --> 01:39:17,440
- Sal, come on. Come on, quick.
- What the fuck are they doing?

2033
01:39:17,533 --> 01:39:18,740
Get them out of there!

2034
01:39:18,826 --> 01:39:19,987
Get...

2035
01:39:20,077 --> 01:39:21,784
That's my place!

2036
01:39:21,871 --> 01:39:24,614
- That's my fucking place!
- Sal!

2037
01:39:24,707 --> 01:39:26,164
Fucking niggers.

2038
01:39:35,968 --> 01:39:37,209

Come on, let's clean house. Shit. Come on.

01:40:09,544 --> 01:40:11,376
I no white. I no white!

2047
01:40:11,462 --> 01:40:13,124
It's your turn, sucker!

2048
01:40:13,214 --> 01:40:15,126
- I no white! I no white!
- No white!

2049
01:40:15,216 --> 01:40:18,129
- I no white! I'm black!
- What? Black?

2050
01:40:18,219 --> 01:40:20,802
- Yeah, I black!
- Me black! Me black!

2051
01:40:20,888 --> 01:40:22,504
- Where you black at?
- Me black!

We same.

Me black!

2057
01:40:35,444 --> 01:40:39,859
- Open your eyes, motherfucker!
- ML, leave the Korean alone, man.

2058
01:40:39,949 --> 01:40:40,949
He's all right.

2059
01:40:42,493 --> 01:40:44,075
Yeah, leave him alone, man.

2060
01:40:44,662 --> 01:40:46,369
Yeah? He's all right.

2061
01:40:46,455 --> 01:40:49,038
- He's black. Ain't that a bitch?
- Shit.

2062
01:41:17,278 --> 01:41:18,610
Oh, fuck you, now!

2063
01:41:19,614 --> 01:41:21,480

Good people, we're giving you

This is our home!

Okay, you've had your warning!

2086
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:48,804
Come on. Move it.
Motherfucker, come on!

2087
01:42:48,828 --> 01:42:50,555
- I'll break your arm.
- Is this Birmingham?

2088
01:42:50,579 --> 01:42:52,912
Fucking Alabama. Yo, where's Bull Connor?

2089
01:42:53,999 --> 01:42:58,414
Son of a bitch!

2090
01:42:58,754 --> 01:43:01,872
Oh, no! No!

2091
01:43:02,383 --> 01:43:06,718

2094
01:43:14,603 --> 01:43:16,185
Oh, no!

I saw it, but I didn't believe it.

2123

I didn't believe it, what I saw.

2124
01:45:04,797 --> 01:45:06,959
Are we gonna live together?

2125
01:45:07,049 --> 01:45:10,417
Together, are we gonna live?

2126
01:45:10,511 --> 01:45:12,548
This is your Mister Señor Love Daddy

2127
01:45:12,638 --> 01:45:17,258
talking to you from WE-LOVE Radio,
108 FM on your dial,

2128
01:45:17,351 --> 01:45:20,469
and that's the triple truth, Ruth.

2129
01:45:20,563 --> 01:45:21,929
<i>Today's weather?</i>

2130
01:45:23,232 --> 01:45:24,348
<i>Hot!</i>

2131
01:45:28,153 --> 01:45:29,234
<i>Wake up!</i>

2132
01:45:31,448 --> 01:45:33,110
Fuck!

2133
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:34,532
My money. Shit!

2134
01:45:34,618 --> 01:45:36,280
Where are you going?

2135
01:45:36,370 --> 01:45:37,486
To get my money.

2136
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:39,663
Ah, don't try that shit, okay?

2137
01:45:39,748 --> 01:45:41,184
You know, you're gonna run out of here

2138
01:45:41,208 --> 01:45:43,746
and I ain't gonna see your black ass
for another fuckin' week.

2139
01:45:43,836 --> 01:45:45,836
- Tina, it's not even like that.
- It is like that.

2140
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:47,712
You don't give a fuckin' shit about me,

2141
01:45:47,798 --> 01:45:49,915
and you definitely don't
give a shit about your son.

2142
01:45:50,009 --> 01:45:51,966
Look, I care about you.
I care about my son.

2143
01:45:52,052 --> 01:45:53,154
- I'll be right back.
- Oh, my God.

2144
01:45:53,178 --> 01:45:55,511
- Why don't you be a man?
- I am a man, all right?

2145
01:45:55,598 --> 01:45:58,966
Then act like a man.
Why don't you be a fucking man, Mookie?

2146
01:45:59,518 --> 01:46:02,306
Shit. I'm so tired of your shit.

2147
01:46:02,396 --> 01:46:04,854
Why do we have to go over this shit
again and again and again?

2148
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:07,808
Because you don't fuckin' listen, Mookie!

2149
01:46:07,902 --> 01:46:10,315
If you listen to me,
I wouldn't have to repeat myself

2150
01:46:10,404 --> 01:46:12,396
like a fucking radio, all right?

2151
01:46:12,489 --> 01:46:14,926
Look what kind of mother you are,
using fuckin' language like that.

2152
01:46:14,950 --> 01:46:16,428
- What kind of mother am I?
- Why don't...

2153
01:46:16,452 --> 01:46:19,786
You need to... Your ass isn't even here!
So don't be telling me

2154
01:46:19,872 --> 01:46:21,975
- what kind of mother I am.
- Get another vocabulary, all right?

2155
01:46:21,999 --> 01:46:24,457
- Why don't you get a fucking life?
- Yeah.

2156
01:46:24,543 --> 01:46:25,784
- Look...
- Look what?

2157
01:46:25,878 --> 01:46:27,606
- I'll be back.
- What... Don't leave, Mookie.

2158
01:46:27,630 --> 01:46:29,496
- I'll be back.
- Don't leave.

2159
01:46:29,590 --> 01:46:31,331
'Cause I'm tired of this shit, all right?

2160
01:46:31,425 --> 01:46:34,008
You walk out that door, that's it.
All right?

2161
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:37,554
I have to get my money from Sal.
I'll be back, all right?

2162
01:46:39,058 --> 01:46:41,141
Your shit is to the curb, Mookie,
all right?

2163
01:46:41,226 --> 01:46:42,888
And I'm tired of it, all right?

2164
01:46:42,978 --> 01:46:46,142
'Cause you need to step off
with your stupid-ass self, okay?

2165
01:46:46,231 --> 01:46:49,065
And you need to get a fucking life,
Mookie, all right,

2166
01:46:49,443 --> 01:46:52,106
because the one you got, baby,
is not working, okay?

2167
01:46:52,196 --> 01:46:54,563
And I ain't going to deal
with this shit no more!

2168
01:46:55,324 --> 01:46:58,863
Fuckin' ass, stupid ass, fuckin' <i>pendejo.</i>

2169
01:46:58,953 --> 01:47:01,366
Shit. I'm tired of this fucking shit.

2170
01:47:03,248 --> 01:47:04,455
Good morning.

2171
01:47:06,627 --> 01:47:08,584
Is it a good morning?

2172
01:47:08,671 --> 01:47:11,038
Yes, indeed.

2173
01:47:11,131 --> 01:47:13,589
You almost got yourself killed last night.

2174
01:47:15,803 --> 01:47:17,886
I've done that before.

2175
01:47:23,268 --> 01:47:24,725
Where did you sleep?

2176
01:47:26,897 --> 01:47:28,013
I didn't.

2177
01:47:31,694 --> 01:47:33,811
I hope the block is still standing.

2178
01:47:35,489 --> 01:47:37,071
We're still standing.

2179
01:48:18,449 --> 01:48:19,449
What do you want?

2180
01:48:19,533 --> 01:48:21,946
I want my money. I want to get paid.

2181
01:48:22,036 --> 01:48:23,322
You don't work here no more.

2182
01:48:23,412 --> 01:48:25,369
Sal, I want my money.

2183
01:48:25,456 --> 01:48:28,073
Your money couldn't begin to pay
for the window you broke.

2184
01:48:28,167 --> 01:48:30,284
Motherfuck a window. Radio Raheem is dead.

2185
01:48:31,378 --> 01:48:34,121
I know he's dead.
I was here. You remember?

2186
01:48:34,214 --> 01:48:37,878
He's dead because of his buddy.
That cocksucker started all this shit.

2187
01:48:37,968 --> 01:48:40,130
He's responsible for that kid's death.

2188
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:43,463
And he wanted to close me,
and you stood there like a fuck

2189
01:48:43,557 --> 01:48:45,139
and you watched 'em burn me down!

2190
01:48:45,225 --> 01:48:48,013
I watched it. I also watched the cops
murder Radio Raheem.

2191
01:48:48,103 --> 01:48:50,373
You're gonna get over
from the fuckin' insurance anyway, Sal.

2192
01:48:50,397 --> 01:48:52,855
- You know the deal.
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

2193
01:48:52,941 --> 01:48:54,352
This ain't about money.

2194
01:48:54,443 --> 01:48:56,059
I could give a fuck about money.

2195
01:48:56,153 --> 01:48:57,735
You see this fuckin' place?

2196
01:48:57,821 --> 01:49:00,234
I built this fuckin' place!

2197
01:49:00,324 --> 01:49:02,782
With my bare fuckin' hands!

2198
01:49:02,868 --> 01:49:05,281
Every light socket, every piece of tile.

2199
01:49:05,370 --> 01:49:07,862
Me! With these fuckin' hands!

2200
01:49:07,956 --> 01:49:09,572
You know what the fuck that means?

2201
01:49:09,666 --> 01:49:12,033
Yeah, it means pay me
my motherfucking money.

2202
01:49:12,127 --> 01:49:14,744
- That's what it means, Sal.
- Okay, Mookie.

2203
01:49:16,715 --> 01:49:18,126
How much do I owe you?

2204
01:49:18,217 --> 01:49:21,426
My salary is 250. 250 a week.

2205
01:49:28,769 --> 01:49:30,351
One...

2206
01:49:30,437 --> 01:49:32,144
that's two...

2207
01:49:32,773 --> 01:49:34,059
that's three...

2208
01:49:35,067 --> 01:49:36,103
that's four...

2209
01:49:36,902 --> 01:49:38,359
and that's five.

2210
01:49:38,904 --> 01:49:41,442
You got $500. You're a rich fucking man.

2211
01:49:41,532 --> 01:49:43,649
Are you happy? You happy?

2212
01:49:43,742 --> 01:49:46,610
He's got 500 fuckin' dollars!

2213
01:49:46,703 --> 01:49:48,239
He's a big man!

2214
01:49:48,330 --> 01:49:49,992
He's a rich fucking man!

2215
01:49:50,082 --> 01:49:53,496
He's never gonna have any more trouble!

2216
01:49:53,585 --> 01:49:54,621
Not Mookie!

2217
01:49:54,711 --> 01:49:56,373
He's fuckin' rich!

2218
01:49:56,463 --> 01:49:57,829
Who the fuck you yelling at?

2219
01:49:57,923 --> 01:50:01,212
You're wealthy, Mookie.
You're a real fuckin' Rockefeller.

2220
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:06,008
You got your fuckin' pay.
Now leave me alone, huh?

2221
01:50:06,098 --> 01:50:08,841
Sal, my salary's 250 a week, all right?

2222
01:50:10,853 --> 01:50:12,310
I owe you 50 bucks.

2223
01:50:13,605 --> 01:50:15,096
- Keep it.
- You keep it.

2224
01:50:15,190 --> 01:50:16,431
- You keep it.
- You keep it.

2225
01:50:16,525 --> 01:50:18,391
- No, you keep it.
- You keep it.

2226
01:50:22,781 --> 01:50:24,192
I don't believe this shit.

2227
01:50:24,825 --> 01:50:26,032
Believe it.

2228
01:50:27,870 --> 01:50:29,077
Are you sick?

2229
01:50:29,788 --> 01:50:32,075
I'm hot as a motherfucker.
I'm all right, though.

2230
01:50:33,959 --> 01:50:36,872
Well, they say it's even gonna
get hotter today.

2231
01:50:40,841 --> 01:50:42,582
What are you gonna do with yourself?

2232
01:50:43,677 --> 01:50:45,669
Make that money. Get paid.

2233
01:50:46,805 --> 01:50:49,388
Sal, I got to go see my son,
if it's all right with you.

2234
01:51:00,027 --> 01:51:02,440
<i>Hey, Mook. It's the Mook man.</i>

2235
01:51:02,529 --> 01:51:05,363
<i>I see you walking down the block.
Go on home to your kid.</i>

2236
01:51:05,449 --> 01:51:07,156
<i>Now the news and weather.</i>

2237
01:51:07,242 --> 01:51:09,859

a blue-ribbon panel, and I quote,</i>

01:51:10,245 --> 01:51:12,908
<i>"To get to the bottom

be destroyed by anyone."</i>

2240
01:51:17,294 --> 01:51:19,377
<i>His Honor plans to visit our block today.</i>

2241
01:51:19,463 --> 01:51:22,376
<i>Maybe he should hook up
with our own Da Mayor, buy him a beer.</i>

2242
01:51:22,466 --> 01:51:26,130
<i>Your Love Daddy says register to vote.</i>
