1
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,265
<i>What is this thing,
that springs from the living?</i>

2
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,765
<i>The scent of a virus</i>

3
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:53,032
<i>The perfume of decay</i>

4
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:59,108
<i>Making a verse of bacteria</i>

5
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:12,865
<i>Fermented wound</i>

6
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,532
<i>Molecular spectacle</i>

7
00:13:17,044 --> 00:13:20,986
<i>Plotting a dance without organs</i>

8
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,199
You inspire me.

9
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,265
With my poor Spanish?

10
00:13:37,469 --> 00:13:41,265
Your Spanish is perfect for poetry.

11
00:17:26,054 --> 00:17:32,032
The wood swells and soaks up water
and whatever is in its surroundings.

12
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,499
It is hyrgroscopic.

13
00:17:34,524 --> 00:17:37,332
Wood is a hygroscopic material.

14
00:17:37,795 --> 00:17:39,232
Here, we can see...

15
00:17:39,987 --> 00:17:45,799
how the presses holding the rings
need several days to...

16
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:53,632
for the materials to adhere,
so that it lasts.

17
00:17:53,726 --> 00:17:57,099
With a low quality instrument,
it will peel away.

18
00:17:57,466 --> 00:17:59,532
Small cracks appear.

19
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:50,040
Excuse me.

20
00:18:50,386 --> 00:18:52,265
- Hernan?
- Yes?

21
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:56,065
- Jessica. Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

22
00:18:56,155 --> 00:18:57,899
I'm Juan's friend.

23
00:18:58,066 --> 00:18:59,799
Yes, of course.

24
00:21:13,726 --> 00:21:15,592
So...

25
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,865
your sound is not a song?

26
00:21:18,939 --> 00:21:20,356
No.

27
00:21:20,725 --> 00:21:22,465
It's a sound.

28
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:25,999
It's hard to explain.

29
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,732
Where did you hear it?

30
00:21:29,415 --> 00:21:31,165
In a room.

31
00:21:35,066 --> 00:21:37,465
It's like...

32
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:45,499
a big ball...

33
00:21:46,483 --> 00:21:48,565
of concrete,

34
00:21:48,915 --> 00:21:54,199
that falls into a metal well

35
00:21:55,935 --> 00:22:00,499
which is surround by seawater.

36
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,165
Maybe it's impossible.

37
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:12,532
No, no.

38
00:22:13,947 --> 00:22:17,465
In fact, after Juan called,
I prepared some tracks.

39
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,899
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

40
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:31,765
How big is the concrete ball?

41
00:23:17,117 --> 00:23:20,432
It has a different echo.

42
00:23:21,146 --> 00:23:23,732
More metallic.

43
00:23:41,197 --> 00:23:42,965
It's more...

44
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,532
"tierra"

45
00:24:15,744 --> 00:24:17,332
Let me try something.

46
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:24,932
This is a library

47
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:27,132
of movie sound effects.

48
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,365
What about this?

49
00:25:08,071 --> 00:25:10,665
Yes, this is close.

50
00:25:12,602 --> 00:25:16,865
I'll import it.

51
00:26:25,064 --> 00:26:26,732
Yes, that's it.

52
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:41,499
I'm sorry. But maybe something more...

53
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:44,932
round.

54
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:47,133
Okay.

55
00:27:00,433 --> 00:27:02,965
Look at this mountain.

56
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:13,199
And now listen to this.

57
00:27:23,548 --> 00:27:25,398
Deeper, perhaps?

58
00:28:00,003 --> 00:28:02,398
It's between 60 and 100 Hz.

59
00:28:15,135 --> 00:28:20,699
The bass depends on what you use
to listen to the sound.

60
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:29,032
On headphones,
on a TV set, in a cinema,

61
00:28:30,276 --> 00:28:32,532
or with a sound system like this.

62
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,499
I don't know.

63
00:29:23,335 --> 00:29:24,765
Let me save it first.

64
00:29:34,521 --> 00:29:36,765
Sorry, what's your name again?

65
00:31:33,949 --> 00:31:35,232
Can I help you?

66
00:31:36,468 --> 00:31:37,599
Excuse me?

67
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,898
I need to get into that room.

68
00:31:41,547 --> 00:31:44,165
Oh, I'm sorry. Right.

69
00:31:51,002 --> 00:31:53,132
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

70
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:57,342
Let me help.

71
00:32:00,493 --> 00:32:01,566
Thank you.

72
00:32:08,255 --> 00:32:11,032
I have no key to lock it
and my team isn't here.

73
00:32:11,057 --> 00:32:12,200
It's alright.

74
00:32:21,666 --> 00:32:23,265
Do you work here?

75
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,332
No, my sister...

76
00:40:10,769 --> 00:40:15,699
Right mandibular condyle
shows joint damage.

77
00:43:17,943 --> 00:43:19,899
I mixed my sounds in.

78
00:44:17,813 --> 00:44:21,665
I'm touched by your interpretation.

79
00:44:22,537 --> 00:44:23,600
Thank you.

80
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,832
There was a little melody from my song.

81
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:30,532
I have a band.

82
00:44:31,266 --> 00:44:33,999
Electronic, punk stuff.

83
00:44:34,512 --> 00:44:36,699
What's your band's name?

84
00:44:37,075 --> 00:44:39,632
The Depth of Delusion Ensemble.

85
00:44:58,824 --> 00:44:59,866
Thank you.

86
00:45:05,046 --> 00:45:09,965
Maybe this song can be
one of your future tracks?

87
00:45:10,931 --> 00:45:14,132
Why not? It would be nice.

88
00:45:14,749 --> 00:45:20,332
It's got some unique acoustic
and psychological aspects.

89
00:45:21,544 --> 00:45:23,799
I'll list you as a collaborator.

90
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,032
Have you been to Tokyo?

91
00:45:53,431 --> 00:45:54,965
Yes, why?

92
00:45:55,835 --> 00:45:57,365
I want to go there.

93
00:46:00,573 --> 00:46:02,932
I have no idea what it's like:
the people,

94
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,346
- the architecture.
- It's really nice.

95
00:46:05,371 --> 00:46:06,765
- Really?

96
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:10,732
I would like to.

97
00:46:12,628 --> 00:46:14,532
A concert in Japan?

98
00:46:17,381 --> 00:46:18,632
You never know.

99
00:46:21,995 --> 00:46:24,532
How many flowers
do you intend to store?

100
00:46:24,614 --> 00:46:27,499
A few hundred, different kinds.

101
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:29,399
It's for a farm.

102
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:33,032
- If you need an on-site cold storage,
- Yes.

103
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,265
we can provide you with the design
and colour of your choice.

104
00:46:37,766 --> 00:46:40,510
Here is our cold storage equipment,

105
00:46:40,535 --> 00:46:43,699
especially designed for flowers.

106
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,332
This one is local.
And this one is from the Netherlands.

107
00:46:47,365 --> 00:46:49,265
in terms of the technology used.

108
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:50,865
They look identical.

109
00:46:51,977 --> 00:46:55,032
This one "un-ages" the flowers better.

110
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:58,832
They last around 30% longer.

111
00:47:00,033 --> 00:47:02,332
In here, time stops.

112
00:47:04,406 --> 00:47:08,532
They are all coated
with Nano-Seal

113
00:47:08,783 --> 00:47:12,632
which prevents all kinds of fungi
and other pathogens.

114
00:47:13,172 --> 00:47:15,032
Do you have a distributor in Medellín?

115
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,065
Yes, we do.

116
00:47:19,387 --> 00:47:20,832
Careful.

117
00:47:22,101 --> 00:47:25,032
The fridges are assembled here.

118
00:47:25,232 --> 00:47:28,365
Those are the cutting machines.

119
00:47:30,296 --> 00:47:34,799
For on-site cold storage...
Let me think.

120
00:47:36,382 --> 00:47:41,132
I have a client from last year.
What's her name...

121
00:47:42,461 --> 00:47:46,999
Let me give you the address of a farm
not far from Bogotá,

122
00:47:47,389 --> 00:47:50,165
so you can see how it works.

123
00:47:50,471 --> 00:47:55,199
I heard their sales skyrocketed
when they started using our fridges.

124
00:47:55,257 --> 00:47:56,999
- May I?
- Sure.

125
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,065
Oh, I know where it is.

126
00:48:02,114 --> 00:48:06,532
I'll prepare the quotes.
I leave you to look around.

127
00:48:06,557 --> 00:48:08,499
We can meet out front.

128
00:48:08,557 --> 00:48:09,899
Thank you.

129
00:48:12,493 --> 00:48:14,332
- Thank you.
- No problem.

130
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:21,265
She says there is a farm in Guasca

131
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:25,039
where they have the same refrigerators.

132
00:48:28,793 --> 00:48:30,499
I can drive you there.

133
00:48:31,333 --> 00:48:33,265
Great, thank you.

134
00:48:35,975 --> 00:48:38,499
But it is two hours away, right?

135
00:48:38,594 --> 00:48:39,666
Yes.

136
00:48:40,033 --> 00:48:41,665
But I can drive fast.

137
00:48:46,375 --> 00:48:49,165
I don't think I can afford it.

138
00:48:56,796 --> 00:48:58,232
I can chip in.

139
00:49:01,665 --> 00:49:04,865
I want to help you buy
the fridge for your orchids.

140
00:49:13,139 --> 00:49:14,233
Why?

141
00:49:16,187 --> 00:49:18,565
I've always wanted a giant fridge.

142
00:49:28,547 --> 00:49:30,065
I have some savings.

143
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:39,965
Are you offering me a loan?

144
00:49:41,066 --> 00:49:42,499
Not necessarily.

145
00:49:48,478 --> 00:49:49,699
Then what?

146
00:49:52,749 --> 00:49:54,865
For a farm in Medellín?

147
00:49:58,241 --> 00:49:59,333
Why not?

148
00:50:02,964 --> 00:50:04,932
Will we go back to the store?

149
00:51:13,952 --> 00:51:16,107
What do you mean?

150
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,099
Protect me from what?

151
00:51:20,066 --> 00:51:22,532
Maybe from the way you work.

152
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:27,932
Your relationship with your job.

153
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,365
-Or leave it...
- Hi!

154
00:52:01,866 --> 00:52:03,132
Good evening.

155
00:52:03,533 --> 00:52:05,799
Hello. Thank you.

156
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:42,732
I meant, the way you work.
Your relationship to it.

157
00:52:42,797 --> 00:52:48,765
If you could get some distance...
or a different mindset.

158
00:52:49,686 --> 00:52:51,841
Or leave it. Leave the job.

159
00:52:51,866 --> 00:52:53,799
No, I'm not leaving my job.

160
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,532
What are you drawing, darling?
An orange?

161
00:56:06,885 --> 00:56:11,117
No it's...

162
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:13,965
- A pomelo
- Yes.

163
00:56:14,004 --> 00:56:17,628
- It's a pomelo?
- It's from a book I gave him.

164
00:56:17,922 --> 00:56:20,665
Tomorrow, we will go to the market
for the pomelos.

165
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:22,532
But those ones won't talk.

166
00:56:22,557 --> 00:56:24,665
He's not three anymore, Juan.

167
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,199
Excuse me,

168
00:58:14,351 --> 00:58:15,899
is Hernan here?

169
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:17,665
Hernan?

170
00:58:18,375 --> 00:58:22,099
Hernan, the sound engineer,

171
00:58:23,232 --> 00:58:25,065
who works upstairs?

172
00:58:26,846 --> 00:58:28,265
In the mixing room?

173
00:58:28,401 --> 00:58:31,032
No, no-one named Hernan works here.

174
00:58:32,274 --> 00:58:36,632
Don't you mean Pablo?
In mixing, there is Pablo or Luis.

175
00:58:42,166 --> 00:58:43,332
Thank you.

176
00:58:48,815 --> 00:58:51,499
He is around 30.

177
00:58:51,958 --> 00:58:54,699
No, almost 30.

178
00:58:57,088 --> 00:58:59,298
About this height.

179
00:58:59,929 --> 00:59:01,399
Short brown hair.

180
00:59:03,294 --> 00:59:04,565
Do you have a photo?

181
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:07,798
No.

182
00:59:17,698 --> 00:59:19,665
Never mind. Thank you.

183
00:59:19,793 --> 00:59:20,933
Okay.

184
01:06:53,604 --> 01:06:56,798
The excavation site
is a little bit further down.

185
01:08:39,462 --> 01:08:40,632
Depth...

186
01:08:41,010 --> 01:08:42,465
31

187
01:08:43,923 --> 01:08:45,332
35

188
01:08:46,708 --> 01:08:48,932
And the bone measures...

189
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,332
39 centimeters long.

190
01:12:18,074 --> 01:12:19,565
Are you in pain?

191
01:12:24,279 --> 01:12:26,332
Sometimes, at elevation,

192
01:12:27,066 --> 01:12:31,365
blood pressure can cause a "pop" sound.

193
01:12:32,764 --> 01:12:34,799
It's not a "pop".

194
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:36,499
Not a "pop"?

195
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:41,532
What kind of pillows are you using?

196
01:12:42,002 --> 01:12:46,065
I use different ones
because I travel a lot.

197
01:12:48,415 --> 01:12:50,899
You should use an orthopedic pillow.

198
01:12:51,865 --> 01:12:54,232
- For traveling.
- Yes, maybe.

199
01:12:56,452 --> 01:12:58,232
Do you sleep well?

200
01:12:59,103 --> 01:13:00,532
I don't sleep.

201
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:03,732
You don't sleep?

202
01:13:09,585 --> 01:13:12,099
It might be a hallucination.

203
01:13:12,785 --> 01:13:13,999
I don't think so.

204
01:13:16,706 --> 01:13:22,065
Does your father, mother,
or any family member

205
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:25,199
have any medical problems?

206
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:27,465
Mental health issues?

207
01:13:33,187 --> 01:13:34,297
No.

208
01:13:38,066 --> 01:13:39,599
And your husband?

209
01:13:47,935 --> 01:13:52,199
In this town, there are many people
with hallucinations.

210
01:13:57,757 --> 01:14:00,965
Maybe I just need something to relax?

211
01:14:04,678 --> 01:14:06,065
A pill?

212
01:14:09,041 --> 01:14:11,399
Are you asking me for a Xanax?

213
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:15,832
No, no.

214
01:14:18,566 --> 01:14:19,832
Maybe, yes.

215
01:14:23,278 --> 01:14:27,465
That type of drug is quite addictive.

216
01:14:29,395 --> 01:14:31,999
It's not a real cure.

217
01:14:32,577 --> 01:14:35,365
Looking at you, I think

218
01:14:35,901 --> 01:14:38,532
you could become addicted to it.

219
01:14:39,639 --> 01:14:40,646
Why?

220
01:14:40,671 --> 01:14:41,899
Besides...

221
01:14:42,417 --> 01:14:44,732
it will make you lose empathy.

222
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:48,532
You will no longer be moved
by the beauty of this world.

223
01:14:50,612 --> 01:14:53,132
Or the sadness of this world.

224
01:14:56,619 --> 01:14:58,799
Jesus is with you.

225
01:15:04,227 --> 01:15:05,366
Read it.

226
01:15:13,174 --> 01:15:15,332
Do you know Salvador Dali?

227
01:15:16,285 --> 01:15:17,321
Yes?

228
01:15:18,809 --> 01:15:21,399
There's a painting of his
hanging at reception.

229
01:15:21,424 --> 01:15:22,599
I saw it.

230
01:15:24,633 --> 01:15:28,065
Salvador Dali understood
the beauty of this world.

231
01:15:33,587 --> 01:15:34,899
But...

232
01:15:35,190 --> 01:15:37,732
don't you think he was taking something?

233
01:15:39,578 --> 01:15:41,150
No, I don't think so.

234
01:15:41,175 --> 01:15:42,383
No, I don't think so.

235
01:15:43,843 --> 01:15:45,599
Definitely not.

236
01:18:15,518 --> 01:18:16,812
Are you okay?

237
01:19:16,695 --> 01:19:18,699
I know where you're staying.

238
01:19:20,336 --> 01:19:21,400
Really?

239
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:25,632
At Eduardo's place.

240
01:19:29,466 --> 01:19:31,232
His father used to run a cinema.

241
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:36,965
His brother is a detective.

242
01:20:00,106 --> 01:20:02,465
Are you the anthropologist
from Bogotá?

243
01:20:03,074 --> 01:20:05,932
No. I'm just passing through.

244
01:20:06,178 --> 01:20:07,665
I live in Medellín.

245
01:20:14,547 --> 01:20:16,632
I've never let this town.

246
01:20:17,531 --> 01:20:18,572
No?

247
01:20:23,988 --> 01:20:25,865
I remember everything.

248
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:28,965
So I try to limit what I see.

249
01:20:35,110 --> 01:20:39,032
That's why I never watch
movies or TV.

250
01:20:41,596 --> 01:20:44,399
You're missing some good things.

251
01:20:47,319 --> 01:20:48,400
Like what?

252
01:20:51,301 --> 01:20:52,899
Like sports,

253
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,765
football.

254
01:21:00,156 --> 01:21:02,765
I don't think football
would do me any good.

255
01:21:04,982 --> 01:21:06,532
Maybe music?

256
01:21:07,432 --> 01:21:08,799
News.

257
01:21:10,456 --> 01:21:12,399
Cooking shows.

258
01:21:13,329 --> 01:21:14,865
Miss Universe.

259
01:21:19,196 --> 01:21:21,265
There are plenty of stories already.

260
01:21:30,046 --> 01:21:31,532
Like this stone...

261
01:21:39,238 --> 01:21:40,832
I hear a man...

262
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:46,865
He was on his lunch break.

263
01:21:51,058 --> 01:21:53,499
Two of his friends punched him

264
01:21:54,137 --> 01:21:55,999
and stole his pendant.

265
01:22:00,009 --> 01:22:01,399
One of them said,

266
01:22:02,096 --> 01:22:03,165
"Hey... Psst!

267
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,465
Let's take his food, too.

268
01:22:06,595 --> 01:22:08,032
It looks delicious."

269
01:22:12,198 --> 01:22:14,632
They took his bag and ran away.

270
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:22,499
He was beaten up again
for following them.

271
01:22:23,811 --> 01:22:25,299
Did you know him?

272
01:22:26,042 --> 01:22:27,105
No.

273
01:22:29,557 --> 01:22:32,599
It happened a long time ago,
but the vibrations...

274
01:22:34,364 --> 01:22:36,980
were embedded here, in this stone.

275
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:58,599
This stone was part of the rock
he wasd sitting on.

276
01:23:03,388 --> 01:23:06,132
The rocks, the trees, the concrete...

277
01:23:06,237 --> 01:23:08,299
they absorb everything.

278
01:23:09,982 --> 01:23:13,232
I too can feel the vibrations
stored in my body.

279
01:23:15,879 --> 01:23:18,199
I remember everything I've eaten.

280
01:23:18,313 --> 01:23:20,299
The weather we've had everyday.

281
01:23:23,322 --> 01:23:26,865
The movement of my hand here,
on this fish.

282
01:23:29,329 --> 01:23:31,199
I realized that...

283
01:23:33,632 --> 01:23:36,265
I have no desire to go anywhere.

284
01:23:39,569 --> 01:23:41,532
Experiences are harmful.

285
01:23:48,213 --> 01:23:51,432
They unleash a violent flurry
in my memory.

286
01:23:54,724 --> 01:23:56,665
So I work the land.

287
01:23:57,486 --> 01:23:58,865
I scale fish.

288
01:24:10,227 --> 01:24:11,465
Can I?

289
01:24:25,605 --> 01:24:26,700
Thank you.

290
01:24:37,914 --> 01:24:39,665
I'm Jessica.

291
01:24:40,316 --> 01:24:41,499
Hernan.

292
01:25:05,045 --> 01:25:07,065
That's the howler monkeys.

293
01:25:13,373 --> 01:25:15,799
Their leader is not happy.

294
01:25:19,081 --> 01:25:22,132
He wants to move on,
but the others don't want to.

295
01:25:25,429 --> 01:25:27,841
Do you understand monkey language?

296
01:25:27,921 --> 01:25:29,024
Yes.

297
01:25:32,566 --> 01:25:35,765
In a few minutes,
the sun will hit that mountain.

298
01:25:45,366 --> 01:25:46,899
I remember...

299
01:25:50,612 --> 01:25:52,265
in space,

300
01:25:54,146 --> 01:25:55,765
we were searching...

301
01:25:58,100 --> 01:25:59,532
And then I was born.

302
01:26:03,058 --> 01:26:05,099
I'm not sure if I understand.

303
01:26:08,264 --> 01:26:10,499
We were in space with the others.

304
01:26:13,837 --> 01:26:15,599
I spotted two lovers,

305
01:26:16,313 --> 01:26:17,932
and then I was born.

306
01:26:34,766 --> 01:26:37,832
These are a good human invention.

307
01:26:39,718 --> 01:26:41,032
What are they?

308
01:26:41,321 --> 01:26:43,299
Some pills.

309
01:26:43,613 --> 01:26:47,899
I managed to get them
from a very tough doctor.

310
01:26:49,383 --> 01:26:51,632
I think you would like them.

311
01:26:58,008 --> 01:26:59,799
But aren't they for you?

312
01:27:01,526 --> 01:27:03,665
I don't think they will help me.

313
01:27:20,986 --> 01:27:23,103
I hear this sound.

314
01:27:25,603 --> 01:27:30,832
But now, I want more of it.

315
01:27:51,455 --> 01:27:53,132
It's strange.

316
01:27:57,798 --> 01:28:00,565
I just remember when I was a baby.

317
01:28:04,850 --> 01:28:06,965
My mother's blouse.

318
01:28:10,622 --> 01:28:14,532
My nose was burning.

319
01:28:19,304 --> 01:28:22,665
I heard very loud noises.

320
01:28:24,955 --> 01:28:27,099
And I cried.

321
01:29:38,835 --> 01:29:41,899
Do you also remember your dreams?

322
01:29:44,915 --> 01:29:46,049
No.

323
01:29:48,142 --> 01:29:49,292
I...

324
01:29:54,268 --> 01:29:56,532
Our kind never dreams.

325
01:29:59,410 --> 01:30:01,432
What happens when you sleep?

326
01:30:05,542 --> 01:30:06,899
Nothing.

327
01:30:14,552 --> 01:30:16,432
Can you show me?

328
01:30:18,136 --> 01:30:19,421
Now?

329
01:30:19,446 --> 01:30:21,199
Yes, sleep.

330
01:32:17,692 --> 01:32:18,733
Hernan?

331
01:37:11,619 --> 01:37:12,965
Do you want water?

332
01:37:16,714 --> 01:37:18,082
No.

333
01:37:22,189 --> 01:37:23,599
How was it?

334
01:37:25,650 --> 01:37:27,324
What?

335
01:37:28,768 --> 01:37:30,565
Death.

336
01:37:36,339 --> 01:37:37,878
It's ok.

337
01:37:42,142 --> 01:37:43,832
I just stopped.

338
01:40:07,409 --> 01:40:10,065
The story of that one is my favourite.

339
01:40:10,169 --> 01:40:11,573
Really?

340
01:40:17,719 --> 01:40:18,833
Sorry.

341
01:40:32,804 --> 01:40:34,465
- Want some?
- Yes.

342
01:40:37,066 --> 01:40:38,499
I made it myself.

343
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:47,565
With my own herbs.

344
01:40:48,919 --> 01:40:50,299
It's very strong.

345
01:41:06,807 --> 01:41:10,132
This stuff brings me close
to what you call a dream.

346
01:41:12,236 --> 01:41:13,442
Yes.

347
01:41:14,652 --> 01:41:16,965
Another good human invention,

348
01:41:18,017 --> 01:41:19,965
even made by you.

349
01:41:32,861 --> 01:41:34,065
May I?

350
01:41:36,853 --> 01:41:37,965
Yes.

351
01:42:10,203 --> 01:42:11,499
Be careful.

352
01:42:12,036 --> 01:42:14,132
You see the stain in the corner?

353
01:42:14,425 --> 01:42:15,832
It's my blood.

354
01:42:16,433 --> 01:42:18,632
That blade came from a blender.

355
01:44:07,734 --> 01:44:12,632
I was hiding under the bed.

356
01:44:16,786 --> 01:44:18,865
With others.

357
01:44:23,882 --> 01:44:26,832
We could hear everything.

358
01:44:32,318 --> 01:44:34,532
They were searching for us.

359
01:44:41,065 --> 01:44:44,565
They searched for us all night.

360
01:45:01,427 --> 01:45:03,265
I was here.

361
01:45:23,575 --> 01:45:26,732
The cover was also blue.

362
01:45:33,626 --> 01:45:35,565
My mother...

363
01:45:36,706 --> 01:45:41,832
She touched and uncurled my fingers,
one by one.

364
01:45:44,709 --> 01:45:48,832
She put my palm against her lips.

365
01:45:54,659 --> 01:45:58,165
I put my face in the pillow.

366
01:46:00,675 --> 01:46:05,499
I moved my head from side to side.

367
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:11,965
My nose burns.

368
01:46:14,349 --> 01:46:16,699
The skin was peeling.

369
01:46:23,890 --> 01:46:27,432
The shadows on the ceiling...

370
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:48,599
You are reading my memory.

371
01:47:02,260 --> 01:47:04,632
I'm like a hard disk.

372
01:47:15,268 --> 01:47:17,132
And somehow...

373
01:47:21,394 --> 01:47:23,665
you are an antenna.

374
01:47:42,408 --> 01:47:44,265
It was dark.

375
01:47:47,456 --> 01:47:52,365
It was 4 a.m. and I needed to pee
but I couldn't go.

376
01:47:57,586 --> 01:48:01,299
So I went there, under the bed.

377
01:48:18,261 --> 01:48:20,899
I wasn't here, right?

378
01:48:32,826 --> 01:48:33,826
No.

379
01:48:41,472 --> 01:48:42,699
I was.

380
01:49:34,657 --> 01:49:36,399
Why are you crying?

381
01:49:43,048 --> 01:49:45,432
They are not your memories.

382
01:50:04,278 --> 01:50:06,132
This sound...

383
01:50:08,476 --> 01:50:10,765
I keep hearing it.

384
01:50:14,492 --> 01:50:16,232
Is it yours, too?

385
01:50:50,096 --> 01:50:51,399
Yes.

386
01:51:03,339 --> 01:51:06,032
But that was before our time.

387
01:53:11,902 --> 01:53:15,032
<i>Let's take his food, too.
It looks delicious.</i>

388
01:53:15,394 --> 01:53:17,732
<i>No, don't do it.</i>

389
01:53:19,990 --> 01:53:21,799
<i>Stop it.</i>

390
01:53:22,370 --> 01:53:24,704
<i>You bastards!</i>

391
02:02:00,287 --> 02:02:05,299
<i>Tremors at Machin Volcano
10 km away, was at level II,</i>

392
02:02:05,454 --> 02:02:07,098
<i>2 km down.</i>

393
02:02:08,494 --> 02:02:13,465
<i>Acousting Monitoring System,
3 km down, reported at level III.</i>

394
02:02:15,481 --> 02:02:18,144
<i>Colombian Archaeology
and History Institute in Bogotá</i>

395
02:02:18,169 --> 02:02:20,139
<i>was notified.</i>

396
02:02:21,322 --> 02:02:23,305
<i>And the positioning of the rock waste</i>

397
02:02:23,330 --> 02:02:26,899
<i>was questioned last week
by Santiago Andrés Gómez.</i>

398
02:02:28,750 --> 02:02:31,565
<i>The pile was left out on
the tunnel's dump.</i>

399
02:02:33,730 --> 02:02:35,932
<i>I didn't see it myself, though.</i>

400
02:02:38,254 --> 02:02:41,865
<i>The rocks may contain
traces of arsenic and copper</i>

401
02:02:41,952 --> 02:02:45,399
<i>that, as a result of rain,
may lead to water contamination</i>

402
02:02:45,467 --> 02:02:47,299
<i>in the area below.</i>

403
02:02:50,559 --> 02:02:53,232
<i>A tomb with the remains of two people.</i>

404
02:02:53,328 --> 02:02:56,699
<i>And the bones
of a not-yet-identified animal.</i>

405
02:02:57,376 --> 02:03:00,932
<i>No sign of tools,
or they have decomposed.</i>

406
02:03:04,881 --> 02:03:08,199
<i>Sadly, one of the skulls was crushed
by the tunnel machince.</i>

407
02:03:08,237 --> 02:03:10,932
<i>along with possibly
some parts of the body.</i>

408
02:03:12,490 --> 02:03:16,065
<i>From the pieces, it is unclear
whether the skull was drilled.</i>

409
02:03:17,893 --> 02:03:21,665
<i>We are extracting
the left 6th and 7th ribs.</i>
