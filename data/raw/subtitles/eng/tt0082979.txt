1
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:43,139
Was that in 1913 or 17?
I can't remember now.

2
00:01:44,473 --> 00:01:49,186
I'm beginning to forget
all the people that I used to know, see?

3
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,735
Do I remember Louise Bryant?

4
00:01:58,362 --> 00:02:01,740
Why, of course.
I couldn't forget her if I tried.

5
00:02:07,163 --> 00:02:08,539
I can't...

6
00:02:08,664 --> 00:02:12,001
I might sort of scratch my memory,

7
00:02:12,084 --> 00:02:14,003
but not at the moment.

8
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:18,466
You know, things go
and come back again.

9
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,094
It was Christopher Street,

10
00:02:22,678 --> 00:02:25,055
and I was thinking about

11
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,350
another street down there instead,

12
00:02:28,476 --> 00:02:31,896
until it came back
that it was Christopher Street.

13
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:34,940
Sometimes I have lapses like that.

14
00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:39,195
I'd forgotten all about them.

15
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:41,197
Were they socialists?

16
00:02:42,698 --> 00:02:44,700
I guess they must've been,

17
00:02:44,784 --> 00:02:46,911
but I don't think they were
of any importance.

18
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:48,746
I don't remember them at all.

19
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:52,041
I know that Jack went around
with Mabel Dodge,

20
00:02:52,124 --> 00:02:55,544
and then he went around
with another gal,

21
00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:58,255
and then he went around
with Louise Bryant.

22
00:02:59,465 --> 00:03:01,884
I know there were shifts back and forth,

23
00:03:01,967 --> 00:03:04,428
but it never occurred to me...

24
00:03:04,929 --> 00:03:08,182
It never impinged on
my own personal life.

25
00:03:08,265 --> 00:03:09,558
I like baseball.

26
00:03:09,683 --> 00:03:12,561
I don't know what
the outside world thought of them.

27
00:03:12,895 --> 00:03:14,605
But they were a couple.

28
00:03:15,272 --> 00:03:18,692
I mean, you always spoke of
Louise Bryant and Jack Reed.

29
00:03:18,776 --> 00:03:22,863
I recall his telling me
that he had two ambitions

30
00:03:22,988 --> 00:03:24,448
when he came to college.

31
00:03:24,573 --> 00:03:27,535
One was to be elected
president of his class.

32
00:03:27,618 --> 00:03:30,412
He didn't know anyone in the class.
No one knew him.

33
00:03:30,538 --> 00:03:33,791
The other was to make a million dollars

34
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,960
by the time he was 25.

35
00:03:36,544 --> 00:03:40,881
Now, my idea about Jack Reed
is probably different from most.

36
00:03:40,965 --> 00:03:45,678
But I knew him well.
I knew he was a man of strong views.

37
00:03:45,761 --> 00:03:47,763
I knew he was independent.

38
00:03:47,847 --> 00:03:50,933
And I have an idea,
I may be wrong of this,

39
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,185
that his wife was a Communist

40
00:03:53,686 --> 00:03:57,731
and that his wife had influenced him,
as any wife does,

41
00:03:57,815 --> 00:03:59,400
as you know and I know.

42
00:04:02,153 --> 00:04:03,362
Louise Bryant?

43
00:04:03,445 --> 00:04:07,283
Well, I thought she was something
of an exhibitionist.

44
00:04:07,491 --> 00:04:10,703
No, I'm not gonna talk about people.
Don't fool yourself.

45
00:04:11,203 --> 00:04:15,082
No, sir. I'm not... I'm not

46
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,877
a purveyor of neighborhood gossip,
or anything of the kind.

47
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,128
That's not my job.

48
00:04:19,587 --> 00:04:21,005
He was quiet.

49
00:04:22,548 --> 00:04:24,550
He was a nice fellow.

50
00:04:25,342 --> 00:04:29,430
I would say, if I met him,
I would say he was a nice fellow.

51
00:04:30,473 --> 00:04:33,851
He was, however, a fighting fellow

52
00:04:33,976 --> 00:04:35,853
in regards to principles.

53
00:04:35,978 --> 00:04:40,316
I said, I think,
that a guy who's always interested

54
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,235
in the condition of the world
and changing it

55
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:45,529
either has no problems of his own

56
00:04:45,738 --> 00:04:47,615
or refuses to face them.

57
00:04:48,032 --> 00:04:51,035
Jack...
Well, I wouldn't call him a playboy,

58
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,453
but some people did.

59
00:04:52,536 --> 00:04:56,582
Jack Reed's life, short as it was,

60
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,043
happened at a time,

61
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,713
and all of us, after all,
are the victims of our time and place,

62
00:05:03,172 --> 00:05:06,675
when he had the opportunity,
as a reporter,

63
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:10,179
to be in some very exciting
and dramatic places.

64
00:05:10,429 --> 00:05:14,016
It isn't everybody can
be buried in the Kremlin,

65
00:05:14,892 --> 00:05:17,228
and he's the only American.

66
00:05:17,353 --> 00:05:19,814
Born in Portland, Oregon.

67
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,983
Now, isn't that something?

68
00:05:23,484 --> 00:05:25,528
- What's he hugging?
- A statue.

69
00:05:25,653 --> 00:05:28,322
Well, I can see that.
But what's it a statue of?

70
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,032
It's just a statue, Mr. Woodward.

71
00:05:30,157 --> 00:05:32,451
- How much is it?
- It's $75.

72
00:05:32,535 --> 00:05:34,453
- For a photograph?
- That's right, Mrs. Rudisile.

73
00:05:34,537 --> 00:05:36,122
This is interesting, Mrs. Trullinger.

74
00:05:36,247 --> 00:05:38,833
Not that it isn't very nice,
but it isn't a painting.

75
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,168
Mr. Woodward,
I'd like you to look at this.

76
00:05:41,252 --> 00:05:43,337
- I think I see the intention here.
- Yes.

77
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,214
Eve dominates, you see?

78
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:47,299
The dream dominates the dreamer.

79
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,843
It's...

80
00:05:51,887 --> 00:05:53,681
It looks blurry to me.

81
00:05:53,848 --> 00:05:56,016
The other one looked blurry, too.

82
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,436
I think that's the intention
of the photographer, Mr. Woodward.

83
00:05:59,562 --> 00:06:00,855
What? To be blurry?

84
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,065
But perhaps if you looked at it
from a different point of view...

85
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,358
Louise!

86
00:06:05,109 --> 00:06:06,819
This is you?

87
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:14,702
Lovely figure.

88
00:06:24,086 --> 00:06:25,713
Louise, have you taken
leave of your senses?

89
00:06:25,796 --> 00:06:27,465
Don't be a fool, Paul.

90
00:06:27,673 --> 00:06:29,508
You think I'm a fool
because I object to my wife

91
00:06:29,592 --> 00:06:31,719
being displayed naked in front
of half the people I know...

92
00:06:31,802 --> 00:06:33,637
Yes. My God,
it's a work of art in a gallery.

93
00:06:33,762 --> 00:06:34,805
What's the matter with you?

94
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,099
You used to call Portland
a stuffy provincial coffin for the mind.

95
00:06:37,224 --> 00:06:38,184
It may be stuffy and provincial,

96
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:40,352
but it also happens
to be a coffin where I earn a living.

97
00:06:40,436 --> 00:06:41,979
You can take your living
and fill up teeth with it,

98
00:06:42,104 --> 00:06:43,522
because I can earn my own living.

99
00:06:43,606 --> 00:06:44,607
I have my work.

100
00:06:44,732 --> 00:06:48,194
You consider a few articles in
The Oregonian and The Gazette work?

101
00:06:48,277 --> 00:06:49,778
No, I'll tell you
what your work is, Louise.

102
00:06:49,904 --> 00:06:51,906
It's making yourself
the center of attention.

103
00:06:51,989 --> 00:06:55,159
It's shocking Louise Trullinger,
emancipated woman of Portland.

104
00:06:55,284 --> 00:06:57,745
Now, we're gonna say good night
to these people and go home.

105
00:06:57,828 --> 00:07:00,122
- I'm going to the Liberal Club.
- You're not going to the Liberal Club.

106
00:07:00,247 --> 00:07:01,916
- I'm going to the Liberal Club, Paul.
- No, you're not...

107
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:06,378
It's very nice, Mrs. Trullinger. All of it.

108
00:07:06,754 --> 00:07:09,298
It's very gratifying to hear,
isn't it, Louise?

109
00:07:09,423 --> 00:07:10,841
Isn't it, Louise?

110
00:07:14,094 --> 00:07:17,348
Of course, you know
who is going to be at the Liberal Club.

111
00:07:17,556 --> 00:07:20,142
Patriotic Americans believe in freedom.

112
00:07:20,351 --> 00:07:24,063
And unless we are willing to take arms
to defend our heritage,

113
00:07:24,146 --> 00:07:27,483
we cannot call ourselves
patriotic Americans!

114
00:07:29,026 --> 00:07:30,903
I'm proud to be free.

115
00:07:31,153 --> 00:07:32,988
I'm proud to be an American.

116
00:07:33,113 --> 00:07:35,908
And if the man
we elected President decides

117
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:37,785
that our freedoms are being threatened

118
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,871
and that the world must
be made safe for democracy,

119
00:07:41,163 --> 00:07:45,459
then I know I won't be alone
in heeding the call of patriotism!

120
00:07:45,668 --> 00:07:47,795
What is this war about?

121
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,548
Each man will have his own answer.

122
00:07:50,923 --> 00:07:54,343
I have mine. I'm ready to be called!

123
00:08:02,643 --> 00:08:04,812
Now, tonight we have with us

124
00:08:04,895 --> 00:08:08,899
the son of Margaret
and the late C.J. Reed of Portland,

125
00:08:09,024 --> 00:08:11,819
who has witnessed this war first-hand.

126
00:08:11,902 --> 00:08:15,281
And I, for one, see no reason
why we here at the Liberal Club

127
00:08:15,364 --> 00:08:18,159
shouldn't listen to what
Jack Reed has to say.

128
00:08:23,581 --> 00:08:27,460
What would you say
this war is about, Jack Reed?

129
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:38,971
Profits.

130
00:08:40,681 --> 00:08:42,016
What did he say?

131
00:08:47,062 --> 00:08:49,565
Excuse me, Mr. Reed.
Hello, my name is Louise Bryant

132
00:08:49,648 --> 00:08:50,608
and I am a journalist.

133
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:52,985
And I was wondering if you might
have time to give me an interview.

134
00:08:53,068 --> 00:08:54,278
I'm sorry, I don't. I don't do interviews.

135
00:08:54,403 --> 00:08:56,822
I had a piece in the Blast not long ago.

136
00:08:57,364 --> 00:08:59,700
- Berkman's Blast? Really?
- That's right.

137
00:09:04,205 --> 00:09:05,790
Well, when did you want
to do this interview?

138
00:09:05,915 --> 00:09:06,874
Now.

139
00:09:06,999 --> 00:09:08,125
I don't live here.

140
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,211
- I live in a house by the river.
- Oh, really.

141
00:09:10,336 --> 00:09:12,129
My, my, my. Two places.

142
00:09:14,465 --> 00:09:17,009
Yeah, I use this place as a studio.

143
00:09:18,344 --> 00:09:20,054
Do you like white lilies?

144
00:09:20,721 --> 00:09:22,515
They're my favorite flowers.

145
00:09:23,557 --> 00:09:27,603
- You're not married, are you?
- No, I don't think I believe in marriage.

146
00:09:27,728 --> 00:09:28,687
- Are you married?
- Marriage?

147
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:30,314
How could anyone believe in marriage?

148
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,692
I bet your mother's glad
to see you back in Portland.

149
00:09:33,776 --> 00:09:36,278
Just glad when I'm not in jail.
Is this you?

150
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:38,155
Yes. Do you like it?

151
00:09:38,989 --> 00:09:41,325
Yeah. I think they're...

152
00:09:42,118 --> 00:09:45,996
- A little blurry, but this one's very nice.
- Yes.

153
00:09:46,122 --> 00:09:47,248
It is. Now...

154
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,460
Granted, the profit motive
in the world economy

155
00:09:51,585 --> 00:09:53,546
is a basic root cause for the war.

156
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:55,923
Do you feel that those
Americans who are pro-war

157
00:09:56,048 --> 00:09:59,677
and who ascribe their motives
to patriotism are cynical or naive?

158
00:09:59,802 --> 00:10:02,179
And, if they're cynical,
is it the cynicism of patriots

159
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:03,931
who feel that without a profit motive,

160
00:10:04,056 --> 00:10:06,767
the power structure elite of this country
will not enter the war,

161
00:10:06,892 --> 00:10:08,310
even though they feel
that the containment

162
00:10:08,394 --> 00:10:10,437
of German militarism
may be necessary for...

163
00:10:10,646 --> 00:10:12,940
All right, Miss Bryant, do you want
an interview? Write this down.

164
00:10:13,023 --> 00:10:13,983
Are you naive enough to think

165
00:10:14,108 --> 00:10:16,443
containing German militarism
has anything to do with this war?

166
00:10:16,527 --> 00:10:18,988
Don't you understand that England
and France own the world economy

167
00:10:19,113 --> 00:10:20,447
and Germany just wants a piece of it?

168
00:10:20,573 --> 00:10:21,615
Keep writing, Miss Bryant.

169
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:23,951
Miss Bryant, can't you grasp
that J.P. Morgan

170
00:10:24,034 --> 00:10:26,120
has loaned England and France
a billion dollars?

171
00:10:26,203 --> 00:10:28,205
And if Germany wins,
he won't get it back.

172
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,957
More coffee?
America would be entering the war

173
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,250
to protect J.P. Morgan's money.

174
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,543
If he loses it, we'll have a depression.

175
00:10:32,668 --> 00:10:33,794
So, the real question is,

176
00:10:33,878 --> 00:10:35,963
why do we have an economy
where the poor have to pay

177
00:10:36,046 --> 00:10:37,339
so the rich won't lose money?

178
00:10:37,465 --> 00:10:38,841
All right, now, what haven't we covered?

179
00:10:38,966 --> 00:10:41,510
Economic freedom for women
means sexual freedom,

180
00:10:41,635 --> 00:10:43,471
and sexual freedom
means birth control...

181
00:10:43,554 --> 00:10:45,264
Dissent! The Masses stands for dissent.

182
00:10:45,347 --> 00:10:46,640
...we have a predominantly

183
00:10:46,724 --> 00:10:47,892
upper-middle class readership.

184
00:10:48,017 --> 00:10:50,603
So, we have to run around the country
raising money for the magazine

185
00:10:50,686 --> 00:10:52,062
any way we...

186
00:10:56,108 --> 00:10:57,318
What?

187
00:10:58,652 --> 00:11:00,988
Well, I'm thinking that I guess I...

188
00:11:01,197 --> 00:11:03,365
That I ought to offer you more coffee.

189
00:11:03,491 --> 00:11:06,202
I hadn't realized the hour, but

190
00:11:06,619 --> 00:11:09,079
I seem to have taken up
a lot of your time.

191
00:11:09,288 --> 00:11:10,998
Well, that's okay by me.

192
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:15,419
Does this happen to you often?

193
00:11:16,587 --> 00:11:17,922
Not often enough.

194
00:11:19,381 --> 00:11:20,424
Well?

195
00:11:22,676 --> 00:11:24,345
We certainly have come a long way fast.

196
00:11:24,512 --> 00:11:25,471
Yeah.

197
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:28,891
Do you want to take it a step further?

198
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:30,851
Yeah.

199
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,772
What would you think if I asked you
to do something

200
00:11:34,897 --> 00:11:36,941
that might seem a little selfish?

201
00:11:37,316 --> 00:11:39,276
Well, I... I think you should.

202
00:11:39,401 --> 00:11:41,904
Good. Good, because I'd like you
to take a look at my work

203
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:43,447
and tell me what you think.

204
00:11:43,572 --> 00:11:45,866
You see, I really respect
your opinion so much.

205
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:48,619
Well, it's odd,
because I was just gonna ask you

206
00:11:48,744 --> 00:11:49,745
if you had anything
I could take a look at.

207
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,206
I know it's an imposition
but I'd be very grateful and you see,

208
00:11:52,289 --> 00:11:54,291
I've read everything
that you've ever written.

209
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,210
Well, I'd be happy to do it. So, that's...

210
00:11:56,377 --> 00:11:57,711
Well, thank you.

211
00:11:58,087 --> 00:12:00,881
Well, then I... I'll get your coat.

212
00:12:02,258 --> 00:12:03,801
Oh, and I hope you won't
be gentle with me.

213
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:05,469
- Gentle?
- I'm a serious writer.

214
00:12:05,594 --> 00:12:06,554
You can really be tough.

215
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,389
No, I will be. No, I will be.

216
00:12:08,472 --> 00:12:10,057
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

217
00:12:10,516 --> 00:12:13,185
- Do you want me to leave?
- Not really, but I'm late.

218
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:16,397
- Late at 6:00 in the morning?
- Yes. I have an appointment.

219
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,440
Well, could I see you tomorrow night?

220
00:12:18,566 --> 00:12:19,733
I'm busy tomorrow night.

221
00:12:19,859 --> 00:12:22,236
- Because I'm leaving town the next day.
- Gee, I'm sorry.

222
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:23,904
So, if you have time,
let me know what you think,

223
00:12:23,988 --> 00:12:26,240
and I'll send you a copy of the interview.

224
00:12:26,657 --> 00:12:28,117
Some interview, huh?

225
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,162
Take a look sometime.

226
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:35,791
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay, I understand.

227
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,084
- Bye.
- Bye.

228
00:12:46,302 --> 00:12:48,929
Jack, dear,
do you remember Mr. Hardison?

229
00:12:49,054 --> 00:12:51,974
Used to be at the First Presbyterian
Church, up the hill.

230
00:12:52,057 --> 00:12:55,186
He's in Seattle now
at the big Plymouth church.

231
00:12:59,815 --> 00:13:02,276
What brings you out here, Jack?

232
00:13:02,526 --> 00:13:04,820
Just come out to see your mother?

233
00:13:06,822 --> 00:13:11,327
Mr. Partlow, I just... I'm raising money
for this magazine that I write for.

234
00:13:11,452 --> 00:13:13,287
- What?
- I say, I'm raising money

235
00:13:13,412 --> 00:13:15,414
for this magazine that I write for!

236
00:13:15,498 --> 00:13:16,999
- Magazine? What magazine?
- Yes, sir.

237
00:13:17,124 --> 00:13:18,375
Well, it's called The Masses.

238
00:13:18,501 --> 00:13:20,211
- The what?
- The Masses!

239
00:13:20,336 --> 00:13:21,796
- The Masses.
- Masses.

240
00:13:22,171 --> 00:13:25,132
Jack, do you remember
Mr. Potterson's sister?

241
00:13:25,216 --> 00:13:26,550
The one with the bad arm?

242
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:29,136
- Is that religious?
- Oh, no, sir. No, sir.

243
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,305
Oh, you remember her, Jack.
Her name was Miriam.

244
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,389
She didn't eat meat.

245
00:13:32,515 --> 00:13:34,099
Sounds religious.

246
00:13:34,183 --> 00:13:36,268
You remember the fellow
that was courting her?

247
00:13:36,352 --> 00:13:39,730
Sold spool thread.
Came from down around Eugene.

248
00:13:39,855 --> 00:13:42,066
- Not religious, huh?
- No, sir.

249
00:13:42,191 --> 00:13:45,486
- What was his name, Jack?
- I don't think I remember the name.

250
00:13:45,569 --> 00:13:48,531
Well, I don't know about you people,
but I'm starved.

251
00:13:48,739 --> 00:13:50,115
I don't know, Mrs. Partlow. I...

252
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:52,493
Jack, I heard you made a few people
a little unhappy

253
00:13:52,618 --> 00:13:53,911
down at the Liberal Club last night.

254
00:13:54,036 --> 00:13:56,122
Oh, Carl,
we're here to have a good time,

255
00:13:56,205 --> 00:13:57,873
let's not go into that.

256
00:13:57,998 --> 00:13:59,750
What was his name, Jack?

257
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,002
- Here you are!
- I can't...

258
00:14:02,086 --> 00:14:03,546
Welcome. So happy...

259
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:05,297
- Hello, Jack.
- Hello.

260
00:14:05,381 --> 00:14:07,133
Oh, you look wonderful.

261
00:14:12,346 --> 00:14:14,181
Alma, this is Louise Trullinger.

262
00:14:14,306 --> 00:14:18,144
Alma Boyle.
This is Ned Boyle and Jack Reed.

263
00:14:18,227 --> 00:14:20,813
Jack, Louise is quite a progressive
in her own right.

264
00:14:20,896 --> 00:14:21,939
Mr. Partlow.

265
00:14:22,064 --> 00:14:24,817
- How do you do, Mr. Reed?
- How do you do?

266
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:28,529
Oh, Mr. Partlow, Mrs. Partlow,
this is Louise Trullinger.

267
00:14:28,612 --> 00:14:30,364
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.

268
00:14:30,447 --> 00:14:32,700
Are you Paul Trullinger's wife?

269
00:14:33,784 --> 00:14:35,536
Yes. Yes, I am.

270
00:14:35,661 --> 00:14:37,538
Well, isn't that something?

271
00:14:37,621 --> 00:14:39,540
He did Frank Rhodes' bridge.

272
00:14:39,623 --> 00:14:43,252
Oh, Mrs. Trullinger, your husband's
the finest dentist in all of Portland.

273
00:14:43,377 --> 00:14:45,463
- Thank you very much.
- Really?

274
00:14:45,588 --> 00:14:47,715
And I think he did a plate
for Uncle Grover.

275
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,176
Oh, we won't wait for Harry and Martha.
I could eat a horse.

276
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:51,302
All right, let's go in.

277
00:14:51,427 --> 00:14:52,928
What a shame Paul
couldn't come tonight.

278
00:14:53,053 --> 00:14:54,221
- An emergency?
- Yes...

279
00:14:54,346 --> 00:14:55,306
Not Uncle Grover's plate, I hope.

280
00:14:55,431 --> 00:14:58,058
- No. Uncle Grover's plate's like new.
- Oh, well...

281
00:14:59,101 --> 00:15:01,562
Did free love start
in Greenwich Village?

282
00:15:02,855 --> 00:15:04,356
Very good wine, Carl.

283
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,277
- More, Jack?
- No, no. No, thank you.

284
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,030
It's just delicious, really.

285
00:15:11,155 --> 00:15:13,324
Don't you think so, Mrs. Trullinger?

286
00:15:13,657 --> 00:15:15,451
Yes, it's just delicious.

287
00:15:15,576 --> 00:15:16,744
Thank you, Louise.

288
00:15:16,869 --> 00:15:18,913
- Dupont, I think.
- Dupont.

289
00:15:20,122 --> 00:15:21,415
It is Dupont, isn't it, Harry?

290
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,835
Mother doesn't want you to get Jack
started on the subject of marriage.

291
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,213
You got any children, Mrs. Trullinger?

292
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:29,006
Not yet, Mr. Reed.

293
00:15:29,131 --> 00:15:30,925
- Call me Jack.
- I've been married 14 years now.

294
00:15:31,008 --> 00:15:33,677
Don't get me in any arguments
about free love.

295
00:15:33,803 --> 00:15:35,012
It's getting cold outside.

296
00:15:35,137 --> 00:15:36,639
I'll just call you Louise.

297
00:15:36,764 --> 00:15:39,433
George Waldorf.
That's it! George Waldorf!

298
00:15:39,558 --> 00:15:40,976
Used to sell spool thread.

299
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,396
- What about George Waldorf?
- Well, he died.

300
00:15:45,397 --> 00:15:47,775
I couldn't think of letting
you walk unescorted, Louise.

301
00:15:47,858 --> 00:15:48,984
Tell me something.

302
00:15:49,109 --> 00:15:52,613
Does Dr. Trullinger mind your
spending so much time at your studio?

303
00:15:52,738 --> 00:15:55,449
People have to give each other
a little freedom.

304
00:15:55,741 --> 00:15:57,535
Freedom, Mrs. Trullinger?

305
00:15:58,202 --> 00:16:00,329
I'd like to know
what your idea of freedom is.

306
00:16:00,454 --> 00:16:02,873
Having your own studio? Walk...

307
00:16:09,672 --> 00:16:12,466
I'd like to see you
with your pants off, Mr. Reed.

308
00:16:37,158 --> 00:16:39,493
Marching and shuffling along

309
00:16:55,134 --> 00:16:56,635
I didn't realize the time.

310
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,805
So, if you like, there's some
very nice damson preserves.

311
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:02,308
And you can make toast out of that,
if you want.

312
00:17:02,391 --> 00:17:04,602
So, bye.

313
00:17:04,727 --> 00:17:05,853
Where you going?

314
00:17:05,936 --> 00:17:07,188
Where you going?

315
00:17:07,313 --> 00:17:09,982
If you're catching the 2:45, I mean,
you don't really have that much time.

316
00:17:10,065 --> 00:17:12,443
- I'm sure you're gonna want to pack...
- Louise, it's 8:45, only.

317
00:17:12,568 --> 00:17:13,611
It's 8:45.

318
00:17:13,736 --> 00:17:15,529
Listen, I realize
that you're very busy in New York,

319
00:17:15,654 --> 00:17:17,114
but I'd be grateful
if you could take the time

320
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:18,866
to write a few words to me
about my work.

321
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:20,117
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

322
00:17:20,242 --> 00:17:22,703
If you'll just send my portfolio back.
You can mail it to this address...

323
00:17:22,828 --> 00:17:25,456
Louise, wait a minute. What are you
just walking out like that for?

324
00:17:25,581 --> 00:17:28,000
Will you come upstairs, please,
and just talk to me for a minute?

325
00:17:30,836 --> 00:17:32,046
Thank you.

326
00:17:32,713 --> 00:17:34,548
- Listen...
- What is it?

327
00:17:37,176 --> 00:17:38,260
Why don't you come?

328
00:17:38,385 --> 00:17:39,762
- What?
- Come to New York.

329
00:17:39,845 --> 00:17:41,514
You wanna write?
Come where the writers are.

330
00:17:41,597 --> 00:17:44,016
If you wanna have freedom you gotta go
where the freedom is, don't you?

331
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:45,976
You're gonna go to waste in Portland.
Come to New York.

332
00:17:46,101 --> 00:17:47,937
- You ought to be in New York.
- Thank you very much.

333
00:17:48,062 --> 00:17:49,063
I'll remember that.

334
00:17:49,188 --> 00:17:51,232
- What?
- I'll remember your advice.

335
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,401
Please come with me.

336
00:17:54,693 --> 00:17:56,403
All right, wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.

337
00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:58,572
You want me
to come with you to New York.

338
00:17:58,697 --> 00:17:59,949
Yeah.

339
00:18:00,074 --> 00:18:01,909
What as? What as?

340
00:18:02,034 --> 00:18:03,619
- What do you mean, what...
- What as?

341
00:18:03,744 --> 00:18:06,205
- Your girlfriend?
- What does that mean?

342
00:18:06,288 --> 00:18:07,581
What as? Your girlfriend,

343
00:18:07,665 --> 00:18:10,709
your mistress, your paramour,
your concubine?

344
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,586
Why does it have to be as anything?

345
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,421
Because I don't wanna
get into some kind

346
00:18:14,505 --> 00:18:17,842
of emotional possessive involvement
where I'm not able to...

347
00:18:19,343 --> 00:18:21,178
I want to know what as.

348
00:18:21,303 --> 00:18:24,598
Well, it's nearly Thanksgiving.
Why don't you come as a turkey?

349
00:18:26,642 --> 00:18:30,688
I always thought she was
a very earnest girl who went away.

350
00:18:30,813 --> 00:18:35,192
Probably the dentist knew nothing
except about teeth,

351
00:18:35,651 --> 00:18:38,445
and was mainly interested...

352
00:18:38,571 --> 00:18:41,782
And then she had
this wonderful journalist

353
00:18:41,866 --> 00:18:44,160
who could talk about all sorts of things.

354
00:18:44,285 --> 00:18:47,329
I had a coat I brought from Germany.

355
00:18:47,455 --> 00:18:49,707
And she wanted that coat

356
00:18:49,832 --> 00:18:53,794
and made me all kinds of propositions.

357
00:18:54,086 --> 00:18:55,713
But I wanted it, too.

358
00:18:57,047 --> 00:18:59,550
But finally I gave in and gave it to her.

359
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,969
I had other coats.

360
00:19:03,345 --> 00:19:08,267
So that's how she operated.

361
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:14,607
She went after him.
As I say, she got him.

362
00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:17,026
So she wasn't any dummy.

363
00:19:18,486 --> 00:19:22,573
But it was something to happen
in little old Portland.

364
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,700
You didn't hear the word "sex."

365
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:26,660
You didn't hear the word "lesbian."

366
00:19:26,744 --> 00:19:28,996
You didn't hear the word "homosexual."

367
00:19:29,622 --> 00:19:32,082
You didn't hear the word "abortion."

368
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,501
You didn't hear those things.

369
00:19:33,918 --> 00:19:35,336
Men respected women.

370
00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:38,672
They helped them on with their coats,
they opened the doors for them.

371
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:41,091
And the man and woman
who courted each other,

372
00:19:41,217 --> 00:19:42,510
they married each other.

373
00:19:42,635 --> 00:19:44,804
You know something that I think,

374
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:49,809
that there was just as much
fucking going on then as now.

375
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,063
Only now,
it has a more perverted quality.

376
00:19:54,438 --> 00:19:57,900
Now there's no love whatever included.

377
00:19:58,025 --> 00:20:00,820
Then, there was your heart,
a bit of heart in it.

378
00:20:00,903 --> 00:20:02,905
Greenwich Village was there,

379
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,032
and New York was around it.

380
00:20:05,115 --> 00:20:09,036
And the rest of New York did not act
the way Greenwich Village did, exactly.

381
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,539
It was sort of a center of dissent

382
00:20:11,914 --> 00:20:15,793
and had been for a long time
in American life.

383
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,462
People from all over
the country came there.

384
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:23,217
They were regarded as bohemian.
Their ways of life were irregular.

385
00:20:23,801 --> 00:20:25,511
The way they dressed

386
00:20:25,761 --> 00:20:27,263
and certainly the way they thought

387
00:20:27,388 --> 00:20:30,141
was outside the mainstream
of American life.

388
00:20:30,266 --> 00:20:31,809
And as I recollect it,

389
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:34,812
marriage was not important
in Greenwich Village.

390
00:20:34,937 --> 00:20:38,399
I remember hearing a line
Jack said to somebody

391
00:20:38,524 --> 00:20:40,484
he was trying to lure into bed.

392
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:44,905
She was being very coy, and he said,
"Aren't you pagan enough?"

393
00:20:45,823 --> 00:20:47,074
Hello?

394
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,252
Hello, Jack?

395
00:21:41,128 --> 00:21:43,297
If it's illegal to hand out pamphlets
on birth control,

396
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,715
I'm proud to be a criminal.

397
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,968
No one is arguing with your
inalienable right to go to jail, Emma.

398
00:21:48,093 --> 00:21:50,221
All I'm saying
is that this is not the right time

399
00:21:50,346 --> 00:21:51,680
to go to jail for birth control.

400
00:21:51,806 --> 00:21:53,724
Oh, there's a right time
to go to jail for birth control?

401
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:55,976
The Masses is governing
conscience now?

402
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,312
Soon you'll be indistinguishable
from The New York Times.

403
00:21:58,395 --> 00:22:00,981
Emma, all I'm saying
is that you are too valuable

404
00:22:01,106 --> 00:22:02,733
- to the anti-war movement.
- You're wrong.

405
00:22:02,858 --> 00:22:06,403
- No, he's right. If we get into this war...
- And you're wrong.

406
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:09,573
- Will you let me finish my sentence?
- Your sentence is not worth finishing.

407
00:22:09,698 --> 00:22:12,326
Thousands of American women,
overworked, underfed,

408
00:22:12,451 --> 00:22:16,497
are dying, giving birth to anemic
children who can't last out a year.

409
00:22:16,622 --> 00:22:19,416
Are their lives any less valuable
than thousands of American boys'?

410
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:22,169
- I want those back Tuesday.
- I'm not saying... Do you think?

411
00:22:22,503 --> 00:22:24,338
- Oh, shit.
- Exactly.

412
00:22:24,421 --> 00:22:25,589
Good night.

413
00:22:25,714 --> 00:22:27,633
- You want some coffee?
- Chase and Sanborn?

414
00:22:28,926 --> 00:22:31,387
- I'm out of coffee.
- Again? I'm leaving.

415
00:22:32,346 --> 00:22:35,057
No, the conversation is over.
You're a journalist, Jack.

416
00:22:35,182 --> 00:22:37,309
When you're a revolutionary,
we'll discuss priorities.

417
00:22:37,393 --> 00:22:38,686
Hopefully over coffee.

418
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:42,022
- It's late, I'll walk you home.
- Why? I won't hurt anybody.

419
00:22:49,864 --> 00:22:51,031
Well...

420
00:22:52,533 --> 00:22:53,576
Yeah.

421
00:22:54,118 --> 00:22:55,744
It's Friday night.

422
00:22:55,995 --> 00:22:57,496
I'm so glad to see you.

423
00:22:57,621 --> 00:22:59,832
Really, I'm so glad to see you.

424
00:23:02,918 --> 00:23:05,212
I finished your articles.
They're very good.

425
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:08,591
The railroad piece, I think, is...
Needs polishing.

426
00:23:08,924 --> 00:23:10,926
- It's repetitious, but...
- But that's deliberate.

427
00:23:11,051 --> 00:23:12,470
I'm using repetition to make a point.

428
00:23:12,595 --> 00:23:13,888
I don't want it to seem too polished.

429
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:15,890
Oh.

430
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:19,226
Well, I think
you're gonna love New York.

431
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,020
Emma, Emma, Emma.

432
00:23:21,103 --> 00:23:23,189
I think it was Emma Goldberg.

433
00:23:23,272 --> 00:23:24,273
I think so.

434
00:23:24,398 --> 00:23:26,066
I never forgot Emma Goldman.

435
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:29,028
She inspired me to the very depths.

436
00:23:29,195 --> 00:23:32,072
And Max Eastman was a beloved man.

437
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:35,075
The real radical, a free spirit.

438
00:23:35,284 --> 00:23:38,913
He was in that same group
with that Emma Goldman.

439
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:42,374
That was her name.
Goldman, not Goldberg.

440
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,168
Floyd Dell was one of them.

441
00:23:44,293 --> 00:23:46,420
He wrote novels, beautiful novels.

442
00:23:46,587 --> 00:23:50,257
The radicals included people
like the IWWs

443
00:23:50,341 --> 00:23:51,884
and Bill Haywood.

444
00:23:51,967 --> 00:23:54,178
And there were Walter Lippmann,

445
00:23:54,303 --> 00:23:57,139
and Lincoln Steffens
and Isadora Duncan

446
00:23:57,264 --> 00:23:59,141
and Edna St. Vincent Millay.

447
00:23:59,266 --> 00:24:00,935
Alfred Stieglitz...

448
00:24:01,101 --> 00:24:02,686
Oh, and Margaret Sanger.

449
00:24:02,812 --> 00:24:05,105
My Lord, I picketed for her.

450
00:24:05,189 --> 00:24:07,733
And, of course,
the great writer Eugene O'Neill

451
00:24:07,817 --> 00:24:09,068
came from down there.

452
00:24:09,151 --> 00:24:12,780
I don't think there's anybody
who can touch O'Neill today.

453
00:24:13,155 --> 00:24:17,284
You have to be a bit of a rebel
to be an artist of any kind, I believe.

454
00:24:17,868 --> 00:24:20,871
And everybody in Greenwich Village
was a bit of a rebel.

455
00:24:29,505 --> 00:24:31,298
- What do you do, Louise?
- I write.

456
00:24:31,382 --> 00:24:33,634
Good for you.
Could you pass the bread, please?

457
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:34,969
- Thanks.
- Because to the middle-class American,

458
00:24:35,052 --> 00:24:37,263
everyone on the left is the same.
An anarchist, a socialist...

459
00:24:45,354 --> 00:24:47,439
Would you pass the bread, please?

460
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:49,942
- What do you do, Louise?
- I write.

461
00:24:50,025 --> 00:24:52,111
Good. Madame Schumann-Heink...

462
00:24:52,194 --> 00:24:55,531
Jack tells me you write, Miss Bryant.
What do you write about?

463
00:24:56,824 --> 00:24:58,033
Everything.

464
00:24:59,118 --> 00:25:00,453
You write about everything?

465
00:25:01,745 --> 00:25:04,498
Everything. Yes. Everything, nothing...

466
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:06,876
Just...

467
00:25:08,794 --> 00:25:09,920
I see.

468
00:25:12,173 --> 00:25:14,842
Now, about Davis and Sloan,
have they quit?

469
00:25:14,967 --> 00:25:15,968
Not yet, but they...

470
00:25:23,392 --> 00:25:26,854
I don't think they should sit here
like this. I don't. I think it's cruel.

471
00:25:27,396 --> 00:25:29,064
- It's just...
- Organization, right?

472
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,150
Look, what does a capitalist do?

473
00:25:31,233 --> 00:25:33,235
Let me ask you that, Mike.
Huh? Tell me.

474
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,862
I mean, what does he make,
besides money?

475
00:25:34,987 --> 00:25:37,573
I don't know what he makes.
The workers do all the work, don't they?

476
00:25:37,698 --> 00:25:39,116
Well, what if they got organized?

477
00:25:39,241 --> 00:25:41,035
I mean, all the workers.
Not just the plumbers,

478
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,204
and the carpenters
and the goddamn cigar makers.

479
00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:44,705
But all of them, all over the world?

480
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:47,333
Not in just one country.
Give him a beer, will you?

481
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:48,876
What if they all got organized?

482
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:51,420
Don't you think they could...
They could change society overnight.

483
00:25:51,545 --> 00:25:52,713
They can make it into
anything they wanted.

484
00:25:52,797 --> 00:25:55,257
Jack, can I tap you for $5? I'm flat.

485
00:25:55,424 --> 00:25:58,719
Well, don't ask this pretentious
son of a bitch for money.

486
00:25:58,928 --> 00:26:01,555
If you need $5, I'll give it to you.

487
00:26:04,391 --> 00:26:05,476
Let me have $4.50, will you?

488
00:26:05,601 --> 00:26:07,353
- What isn't fair?
- You see what I'm saying?

489
00:26:07,436 --> 00:26:10,189
If all the workers in the world
belonged to one big union,

490
00:26:10,272 --> 00:26:12,316
- there wouldn't be a war, would there?
- Are you listening to me?

491
00:26:12,441 --> 00:26:13,776
Miss Bryant.

492
00:26:14,443 --> 00:26:16,737
You've been nursing
that beer for an hour.

493
00:26:16,862 --> 00:26:18,447
Can I get you a glass of wine
or something?

494
00:26:18,572 --> 00:26:20,533
No, thank you. I'm fine.
Thank you, anyway.

495
00:26:20,658 --> 00:26:23,285
- Beer's fine.
- You are an amiable person.

496
00:26:23,619 --> 00:26:25,246
And a very good painter, I hear.

497
00:26:26,372 --> 00:26:27,581
I write.

498
00:26:37,675 --> 00:26:39,135
Read Jung!

499
00:26:39,468 --> 00:26:41,846
"Read Freud, read Jung."
Read Engels, read Marx!

500
00:26:41,971 --> 00:26:44,932
My God, you can't interpret Freud
in an economic context.

501
00:26:45,057 --> 00:26:46,892
You know you got a taxi waiting?

502
00:26:46,976 --> 00:26:49,228
Zosima represents
the corruption of religion.

503
00:26:49,311 --> 00:26:50,312
I tell you you're wrong.

504
00:26:50,396 --> 00:26:53,524
- And Jung is a mystic...
- But do you seriously believe...

505
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:59,321
- How long are they going to stay?
- I don't know. They'll get out in a while.

506
00:26:59,405 --> 00:27:02,449
- I'll only be gone for a day.
- You just got back from Boston.

507
00:27:02,533 --> 00:27:03,951
Hey, why don't you come
with me to Baltimore?

508
00:27:04,034 --> 00:27:06,245
Really? What am I supposed
to come to Baltimore as?

509
00:27:06,328 --> 00:27:07,621
What as?

510
00:27:07,746 --> 00:27:10,082
Jack, you know, you got a taxi waiting.

511
00:27:11,292 --> 00:27:12,751
Taxi's waiting, Jack.

512
00:27:13,836 --> 00:27:15,129
See you tomorrow.

513
00:27:22,845 --> 00:27:25,306
We've been trying for two years.

514
00:27:25,389 --> 00:27:28,684
Capitalists can take this country into
war any time they damn well please.

515
00:27:28,809 --> 00:27:30,936
The only impact you can make
is in the streets.

516
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,062
Of course, but...

517
00:27:32,188 --> 00:27:34,148
But don't you think, Emma,

518
00:27:35,274 --> 00:27:37,985
that if Debs gets a lot of votes,
it'll strengthen that image?

519
00:27:38,068 --> 00:27:40,863
No, I don't. I think voting is the opium
of the masses in this country.

520
00:27:40,988 --> 00:27:42,823
Every four years, you deaden the pain.

521
00:27:42,948 --> 00:27:44,116
Yeah, but...

522
00:27:45,951 --> 00:27:47,077
Don't you think...

523
00:27:47,203 --> 00:27:50,164
I just made it very clear
what I think, Miss Bryant.

524
00:27:50,289 --> 00:27:52,458
Come on, E.G.
Don't be so goddamn dogmatic.

525
00:27:52,541 --> 00:27:55,544
- Louise has a point. She says...
- Suddenly I'm dogmatic.

526
00:27:55,628 --> 00:27:58,547
Why does my status change
every time you get a new woman, Jack?

527
00:27:58,631 --> 00:28:01,842
Bernie, could I have the red wine?
Louise, would you like a glass?

528
00:28:01,926 --> 00:28:03,928
She's just... She's upset with me.

529
00:28:04,053 --> 00:28:06,847
It's got nothing to do with you.
Nothing to do with you.

530
00:28:06,931 --> 00:28:09,600
Thank you. It's a great comfort.

531
00:28:09,975 --> 00:28:12,478
The house is completely filled
with people when you're gone.

532
00:28:12,603 --> 00:28:14,438
They use it as if it was
a meeting hall or something.

533
00:28:14,563 --> 00:28:16,732
- I can't get any work done.
- Just throw them out.

534
00:28:16,857 --> 00:28:18,526
- How am I supposed to throw them out?
- Just kick them out.

535
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:19,693
Tell them to leave.

536
00:28:19,777 --> 00:28:21,237
I'm not going to
say to Max Eastman, "Leave."

537
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,738
- Just throw them out.
- Jack?

538
00:28:22,863 --> 00:28:25,616
Jack, is that you?
Jack, it's very good to see you.

539
00:28:25,741 --> 00:28:28,202
- Hello, Horace. How are you?
- Very good to see you.

540
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,248
- You know Louise Bryant?
- Yes, hello. How are you?

541
00:28:32,373 --> 00:28:34,375
- Very nice to see you.
- How do you do?

542
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,543
Great pleasure.

543
00:28:35,668 --> 00:28:37,628
- Hi, Max. How are you?
- Divine, Horace.

544
00:28:37,753 --> 00:28:39,547
- And Floyd, good to see you.
- Hello, Horace.

545
00:28:39,755 --> 00:28:41,674
Still getting arrested, Jack?

546
00:28:41,757 --> 00:28:42,883
I try.

547
00:28:45,094 --> 00:28:46,137
How about you, Miss Bryant?

548
00:28:46,262 --> 00:28:48,222
Are you trying to get arrested, too?

549
00:28:48,347 --> 00:28:49,849
No, not really.

550
00:28:51,767 --> 00:28:54,895
- What do you do, Miss Bryant?
- I write.

551
00:28:55,437 --> 00:28:59,483
You write? Now, may I ask,
what are you working on?

552
00:29:01,402 --> 00:29:03,571
It's impossible to describe.

553
00:29:03,696 --> 00:29:05,114
It's impossible to describe?

554
00:29:05,197 --> 00:29:06,198
She just did a hell of a piece

555
00:29:06,323 --> 00:29:08,576
on the influence of the Armory Show
and you ought to read it.

556
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:10,870
Well, you know,
I very much would like to read that.

557
00:29:11,412 --> 00:29:13,831
Why don't you give me a call
at The Metropolitan?

558
00:29:14,081 --> 00:29:16,876
In fact, even better,
why don't we have a drink on Thursday?

559
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:19,628
- Fine.
- We can talk about the Armory Show.

560
00:29:19,753 --> 00:29:20,963
- It's a date, then.
- Well, all right.

561
00:29:21,088 --> 00:29:22,548
That's wonderful. Fine.

562
00:29:22,631 --> 00:29:23,883
Jack!

563
00:29:26,802 --> 00:29:29,305
Now, you stay out
of the slammer, now, okay?

564
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,268
Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.
It's nice to see you.

565
00:29:36,312 --> 00:29:38,147
- Jack, please don't do that.
- What?

566
00:29:38,272 --> 00:29:40,399
He's the editor of Metropolitan.
I've known him for years.

567
00:29:40,483 --> 00:29:43,527
- Jack, I can speak for myself.
- So can your work.

568
00:29:43,652 --> 00:29:45,070
- I don't want you to do that...
- Taxi's waiting, Jack.

569
00:29:45,154 --> 00:29:47,114
Oh. Taxi's waiting, Jack.

570
00:29:51,786 --> 00:29:52,953
Jack...

571
00:29:54,205 --> 00:29:56,665
I'll see you at the end
of the week, okay?

572
00:29:58,167 --> 00:29:59,251
- Okay?
- Wait. Wait.

573
00:29:59,335 --> 00:30:01,754
Maybe I will call him about Thursday.

574
00:30:01,837 --> 00:30:04,465
Yeah, call him about Thursday.
Yeah, yeah.

575
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,258
- See you, boys.
- Bye-bye, Jack.

576
00:30:06,342 --> 00:30:08,177
- Bye-bye, Jack.
- See you.

577
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:10,596
See you, Jack.

578
00:30:16,644 --> 00:30:18,896
"The railroad's opening new frontiers,

579
00:30:19,271 --> 00:30:22,024
"and crisscrossing it all
are the railroads.

580
00:30:22,149 --> 00:30:24,401
"The railroad's opening new frontiers,

581
00:30:24,527 --> 00:30:26,821
"and in turn, these frontiers...

582
00:30:27,112 --> 00:30:29,323
"And in turn, these frontiers..."

583
00:30:29,448 --> 00:30:30,658
Oh, God.

584
00:30:33,744 --> 00:30:35,246
It is repetitious.

585
00:30:38,999 --> 00:30:41,043
We're not human beings,
we're a commodity.

586
00:30:41,168 --> 00:30:42,795
- And how many days a week?
- Seven days.

587
00:30:42,878 --> 00:30:44,004
- Every day?
- They said,

588
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:47,341
"If you don't come to work on Sunday,
don't come on Monday."

589
00:30:47,466 --> 00:30:49,468
- What do you make an hour?
- 20 cents.

590
00:30:49,552 --> 00:30:52,263
How many times have they
slammed the door on your face

591
00:30:52,388 --> 00:30:54,849
because the labor you do
is called unskilled?

592
00:30:54,932 --> 00:30:56,016
That's right, Bill.

593
00:30:56,142 --> 00:30:58,477
Well, the IWW's not gonna
turn you down

594
00:30:58,561 --> 00:31:00,271
- because you're unskilled.
- Listen to him, George.

595
00:31:00,688 --> 00:31:04,150
Or skilled. Or black or white or yellow.

596
00:31:04,275 --> 00:31:05,526
Seven days a week.

597
00:31:05,651 --> 00:31:07,695
- What do you make an hour?
- 10 cents an hour.

598
00:31:07,778 --> 00:31:08,737
One big union.

599
00:31:09,363 --> 00:31:13,033
- All workers belong...
- Listen, read that. That's important.

600
00:31:13,534 --> 00:31:16,370
I'm looking for a lathe worker
named Pasquale Alberti.

601
00:31:16,454 --> 00:31:19,457
He had an industrial accident. He got
his leg crushed. Do you know him?

602
00:31:19,582 --> 00:31:21,083
Yeah, sure, Harvard.

603
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:23,627
Is that what they wanna read about
in Greenwich Village now,

604
00:31:23,752 --> 00:31:24,879
industrial accidents?

605
00:31:27,798 --> 00:31:29,675
And for that, we need power.

606
00:31:29,967 --> 00:31:32,553
And there's only one way to get power.

607
00:31:32,887 --> 00:31:34,096
Organize!

608
00:31:34,221 --> 00:31:36,557
All the workers together!

609
00:31:36,682 --> 00:31:38,392
One big union!

610
00:31:38,726 --> 00:31:43,189
And the war the IWW
wants you to get into is class war!

611
00:31:43,272 --> 00:31:44,982
Not a war in Europe!

612
00:31:45,107 --> 00:31:47,234
War against the capitalists!

613
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:49,737
You'll never get anything or anywhere,

614
00:31:49,862 --> 00:31:53,657
until the whole working class
belongs to one big...

615
00:31:54,283 --> 00:31:55,951
All right, gentlemen,

616
00:31:56,076 --> 00:31:58,954
you've got 20 seconds
to vacate the premises.

617
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,297
May I ask on what authority?

618
00:32:08,422 --> 00:32:09,965
On my authority.

619
00:32:10,174 --> 00:32:12,092
This is an illegal assembly.

620
00:32:12,176 --> 00:32:14,678
Excuse me, Officer. These men
have the legal right to assemble.

621
00:32:14,804 --> 00:32:15,971
That's all they're doing.

622
00:32:16,096 --> 00:32:17,765
We know what the hell they doing.

623
00:32:17,848 --> 00:32:19,767
- What the hell you doing?
- Me?

624
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:20,935
You.

625
00:32:21,018 --> 00:32:22,478
- I write.
- You write?

626
00:32:23,562 --> 00:32:24,605
You wrong.

627
00:32:28,484 --> 00:32:29,985
Get him out of here!

628
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,367
Here they are.

629
00:32:36,492 --> 00:32:37,660
The folio. The oeuvre.

630
00:32:40,996 --> 00:32:42,164
Well...

631
00:32:43,374 --> 00:32:44,625
How is Jack?

632
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:48,170
I do hope he's being more careful
about what he's writing these days.

633
00:32:48,295 --> 00:32:50,256
I'd hate to see him not able
to get into print.

634
00:32:50,381 --> 00:32:52,133
Oh, I'm sure he'll do fine.

635
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:57,012
Did you tell him
where we were having drinks?

636
00:32:57,179 --> 00:32:59,014
No, I will. He's out of town.

637
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:02,518
Mr. Whigham, excuse me, but
the Armory Show piece is on the top.

638
00:33:02,643 --> 00:33:04,562
Oh, this is the Armory...

639
00:33:04,687 --> 00:33:07,648
- Yes.
- Yes. Of course. Here it is.

640
00:33:14,488 --> 00:33:15,781
Well...

641
00:33:16,574 --> 00:33:18,868
I really ought to spend
more time on this.

642
00:33:18,993 --> 00:33:20,411
Oh, yes, of course.

643
00:33:20,786 --> 00:33:22,121
What about dinner?

644
00:33:23,205 --> 00:33:25,499
- Dinner?
- Jack wouldn't mind.

645
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:29,503
- Why would he mind?
- Well, we're all grownups, of course,

646
00:33:29,628 --> 00:33:31,505
but Jack's rather...

647
00:33:32,131 --> 00:33:33,966
He's rather an odd duck, isn't he?

648
00:33:34,049 --> 00:33:35,301
And I've never really known how...

649
00:33:35,384 --> 00:33:36,677
Mr. Whigham, are you saying you need

650
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,013
Jack's permission
to make a pass at me?

651
00:33:42,057 --> 00:33:43,184
Don't get so upset about it.

652
00:33:43,267 --> 00:33:45,019
For Christ's sake,
I made two little tiny changes...

653
00:33:45,144 --> 00:33:46,604
Don't rewrite what I write, Pete.

654
00:33:46,729 --> 00:33:48,772
What the hell's the matter
with you, Jack?

655
00:33:48,898 --> 00:33:50,983
The IWW's a bunch of Reds.

656
00:33:51,066 --> 00:33:52,151
Come on.

657
00:33:52,443 --> 00:33:54,737
We got Reds in the IWW,
got Reds in the Village.

658
00:33:54,862 --> 00:33:56,572
We've got nothing
but Reds around here.

659
00:33:56,697 --> 00:33:59,575
For Christ's sake,
you're the best goddamn writer around.

660
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,327
Now, what the hell
you wanna waste your time

661
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:03,537
with a lot of Red propaganda
nobody's ever gonna print?

662
00:34:03,662 --> 00:34:05,581
It's the truth.
Does that mean anything around here?

663
00:34:05,706 --> 00:34:07,208
Well, who the hell's to say
what the truth is?

664
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:09,210
A bunch of goddamn Reds in the IWW?

665
00:34:09,293 --> 00:34:11,253
You're not being fair to the AF of L.

666
00:34:11,337 --> 00:34:14,131
- Now, give me the goddamn article...
- You're gonna rewrite what I write.

667
00:34:14,256 --> 00:34:16,342
I'm just gonna take it
to a magazine that won't.

668
00:34:16,425 --> 00:34:18,052
Well, fine. Take it to The Masses.

669
00:34:18,177 --> 00:34:19,470
- They're a bunch of Reds.
- Thank you.

670
00:34:19,595 --> 00:34:21,680
- Who's gonna pay your rent?
- Rent's easy, Pete.

671
00:34:21,764 --> 00:34:24,642
You just don't rewrite what I write.
You got that? Don't rewrite what I write.

672
00:34:24,767 --> 00:34:27,853
You stubborn son of a bitch.
Who's gonna pay your rent?

673
00:34:43,953 --> 00:34:45,079
Louise?

674
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,974
I got every one in the shop.

675
00:35:05,641 --> 00:35:07,643
We're broke, but we've got them all.

676
00:35:11,814 --> 00:35:12,857
Thanks.

677
00:35:16,986 --> 00:35:18,904
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

678
00:35:18,988 --> 00:35:21,740
- What is it?
- It's nothing. How'd it go?

679
00:35:21,991 --> 00:35:23,617
A lot better than we thought it would.

680
00:35:23,742 --> 00:35:26,579
- You see Whigham?
- Yesterday.

681
00:35:26,662 --> 00:35:29,623
- How was that?
- We mostly talked about you, of course.

682
00:35:29,707 --> 00:35:31,167
Did he offer you work?

683
00:35:31,292 --> 00:35:33,002
No, but he made a big point
of telling me

684
00:35:33,127 --> 00:35:35,713
what wonderful friends
you and he have become over the years.

685
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:37,715
It was a fascinating meeting.

686
00:35:39,175 --> 00:35:41,135
Are you angry at Whigham or me?

687
00:35:43,762 --> 00:35:44,847
What is it?

688
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:47,057
It's nothing.
You said you'd be back Tuesday

689
00:35:47,183 --> 00:35:48,392
and it's Saturday.

690
00:35:48,684 --> 00:35:50,436
Didn't I say I'd back
at the end of the week?

691
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:52,813
- The end of the week is Friday.
- The end of the week is Friday?

692
00:35:52,938 --> 00:35:54,356
Saturday's not the
end of the week anymore, huh?

693
00:35:54,482 --> 00:35:55,858
Jack, you said you'd be back Tuesday!

694
00:35:55,983 --> 00:35:57,026
What difference does it make?

695
00:35:57,151 --> 00:35:58,235
What do you think I've been doing?

696
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,196
Running around listening
to the sound of my own voice?

697
00:36:00,321 --> 00:36:02,281
How do I know whose voice
you've been listening to?

698
00:36:02,364 --> 00:36:04,909
Obviously you like it
a lot better than mine!

699
00:36:15,753 --> 00:36:17,463
Look at me. Oh, God!

700
00:36:18,464 --> 00:36:19,840
I'm like a wife.

701
00:36:21,634 --> 00:36:26,555
I'm like a boring, clinging,
miserable little wife.

702
00:36:27,848 --> 00:36:30,309
- Who'd wanna come home to me?
- Me!

703
00:36:30,893 --> 00:36:32,686
Well, I can't do this!
I can't do this anymore!

704
00:36:32,812 --> 00:36:34,271
You can't do what?

705
00:36:35,564 --> 00:36:37,066
I'm just living in your margins.

706
00:36:37,191 --> 00:36:39,735
I don't know what I'm doing here.
I don't know what my purpose is.

707
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:43,030
- Well, tell me what you want.
- I want to stop needing you!

708
00:36:43,197 --> 00:36:44,156
I want you to know something.

709
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,700
I asked Whigham
if he'd send me to France.

710
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,622
- Is that what you want?
- That's what I want.

711
00:36:56,001 --> 00:36:58,212
- What are you doing, Louise?
- I can't work around you.

712
00:36:58,295 --> 00:36:59,296
Will you tell me why you're doing this?

713
00:36:59,421 --> 00:37:01,132
I'm not taken seriously
when you're around.

714
00:37:01,257 --> 00:37:02,550
When I'm around
you're not taken seriously?

715
00:37:02,633 --> 00:37:03,801
Oh, God, this is not good.

716
00:37:03,926 --> 00:37:05,302
You mean
you think I'm taken more seriously?

717
00:37:05,427 --> 00:37:06,387
Is that what you're talking about?

718
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,097
Do you mean you're not?
Come on, Jack.

719
00:37:08,222 --> 00:37:10,307
You know what I'm saying.
You're not being honest with me.

720
00:37:10,432 --> 00:37:11,433
I don't know what you're saying.

721
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:14,103
You're not being honest with me.
Please, be honest with me.

722
00:37:14,228 --> 00:37:15,187
I am so being honest with you.

723
00:37:15,312 --> 00:37:18,065
Maybe if you took yourself a little more
seriously, other people would, too.

724
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,733
I told you what I thought
about the Armory piece.

725
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:20,860
I was honest about that.

726
00:37:20,943 --> 00:37:23,445
I think it's very nice,
but no, I don't take it very seriously.

727
00:37:23,571 --> 00:37:24,613
- Thank you.
- Why do you even expect

728
00:37:24,738 --> 00:37:27,783
to be taken seriously if you're
not writing about serious things?

729
00:37:27,908 --> 00:37:29,118
I don't understand that.

730
00:37:29,243 --> 00:37:31,370
I found myself an apartment.
I'm looking for one.

731
00:37:31,454 --> 00:37:33,539
I'm not even sure I know
what things you're serious about.

732
00:37:33,622 --> 00:37:34,915
One day you're writing
about the railroads,

733
00:37:34,999 --> 00:37:36,208
and you don't even finish the piece.

734
00:37:36,292 --> 00:37:38,252
The next day you're doing a piece
on an art exhibition

735
00:37:38,335 --> 00:37:39,753
that happened three years ago.

736
00:37:39,879 --> 00:37:41,630
Look, why do you give me
anything to read, anyway?

737
00:37:41,755 --> 00:37:44,175
If I criticize it at all,
you tell me you like it the way it is.

738
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,676
And when we're out with other people,

739
00:37:45,801 --> 00:37:47,553
if somebody doesn't ask you
a direct question,

740
00:37:47,636 --> 00:37:48,971
you tell me you feel ignored.

741
00:37:49,096 --> 00:37:51,098
But with everything
that's happening in the world today,

742
00:37:51,223 --> 00:37:52,850
you decide to sit down and write a piece

743
00:37:52,975 --> 00:37:56,687
on the influence of the goddamned
Armory Show of 1913!

744
00:37:56,812 --> 00:37:58,439
Are people supposed
to take that seriously?

745
00:37:58,564 --> 00:37:59,773
Well, I don't really care!

746
00:37:59,899 --> 00:38:01,275
- You care!
- I'm not really... I don't care!

747
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:02,902
- You care!
- I don't care!

748
00:38:03,027 --> 00:38:06,071
And I'm not interested
in whether your stupid friends

749
00:38:06,197 --> 00:38:08,365
- take me seriously or not!
- Well, they don't take it seriously.

750
00:38:08,491 --> 00:38:09,658
That's why they don't take it seriously.

751
00:38:09,784 --> 00:38:11,869
I found an apartment on Houston Street,
and I'm moving in.

752
00:38:11,994 --> 00:38:14,497
And I'll tell you something else,
Jack Reed.

753
00:38:14,622 --> 00:38:16,957
I don't think we like the same people
or the same kind of life.

754
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:19,043
- And I wanna be on my own.
- Go ahead, be on your own!

755
00:38:19,168 --> 00:38:20,711
I don't give a damn!
You're on your own anyway.

756
00:38:20,836 --> 00:38:22,421
Oh! I know you don't give a damn!

757
00:38:22,505 --> 00:38:24,131
Well, will you tell me
why the hell I should give a damn?

758
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,508
You shouldn't! Don't give a damn!

759
00:38:25,633 --> 00:38:28,135
- I don't give a damn, either!
- That's right! I don't give a damn!

760
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:31,597
- I'm getting out of here!
- Good, fine! I'm leaving, too!

761
00:39:18,644 --> 00:39:22,314
Honey, can we just
get out of New York?

762
00:39:23,566 --> 00:39:25,734
Let's go somewhere
and just write what we wanna write.

763
00:39:59,768 --> 00:40:04,690
Provincetown was
just a tiny little fishing village.

764
00:40:05,107 --> 00:40:08,694
And it was very, very conservative.

765
00:40:09,153 --> 00:40:12,698
We'd take the Fall River steamer
up there, I remember, every summer.

766
00:40:12,781 --> 00:40:15,367
We used to save fares
by sleeping in tiers.

767
00:40:15,451 --> 00:40:17,369
And we always got bedbugs.

768
00:40:17,453 --> 00:40:19,455
You did whatever you pleased up there.

769
00:40:19,538 --> 00:40:23,000
And we put on some very
interesting plays, experimental plays

770
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:25,544
that a commercial theater
couldn't possibly do.

771
00:40:25,628 --> 00:40:28,464
Take Susan Glaspell's Trifles.

772
00:40:28,631 --> 00:40:30,132
There's a whole play

773
00:40:30,257 --> 00:40:33,636
without the protagonist
even appearing on the stage.

774
00:40:33,761 --> 00:40:36,180
And they gave three one-act plays.

775
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,390
One of them was a play by...

776
00:40:38,474 --> 00:40:42,019
I always thought it was by John Reed
and Louise Bryant.

777
00:40:42,311 --> 00:40:43,979
But I see it's by her.

778
00:40:44,104 --> 00:40:45,105
They were in it.

779
00:40:45,231 --> 00:40:48,025
The play was terrible,
and they were worse.

780
00:40:48,651 --> 00:40:51,612
And of course, Gene O'Neill
was known as the poet,

781
00:40:51,987 --> 00:40:54,907
but I liked his plays
better than his poetry.

782
00:40:55,533 --> 00:40:56,617
Will you never understand?

783
00:40:56,742 --> 00:40:59,328
Are you so stupid
that you do not know what I mean?

784
00:40:59,453 --> 00:41:01,122
I am offering myself to you.

785
00:41:01,205 --> 00:41:03,124
I am kneeling before you.

786
00:41:03,374 --> 00:41:05,459
I have promised you my body,

787
00:41:05,584 --> 00:41:07,795
my body that men have
found so beautiful.

788
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,674
I have promised to love you,
a negro sailor!

789
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,845
Tell them not to stand behind the moon.

790
00:41:16,428 --> 00:41:18,055
Don't stand behind the moon.

791
00:41:18,347 --> 00:41:20,015
- Back?
- Can you step back a little bit?

792
00:41:20,641 --> 00:41:21,767
'Cause of the moon.

793
00:41:21,851 --> 00:41:23,435
This is the moon here.

794
00:41:23,686 --> 00:41:24,937
- This way?
- Yes.

795
00:41:25,187 --> 00:41:27,189
Take it from "I hate the sea."

796
00:41:27,356 --> 00:41:28,440
Will you never understand?

797
00:41:28,524 --> 00:41:30,568
Are you so stupid
that you don't know what I mean?

798
00:41:30,693 --> 00:41:32,403
I'm offering myself to you.

799
00:41:32,528 --> 00:41:34,822
I'm kneeling before you.

800
00:41:34,905 --> 00:41:37,741
I... I, who have had so many men
kneel before me,

801
00:41:37,867 --> 00:41:39,702
I'm offering you my body,

802
00:41:39,827 --> 00:41:42,705
my body that men have
found so beautiful.

803
00:41:43,372 --> 00:41:45,416
I have promised to love you.

804
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:47,418
You, a negro sailor.

805
00:41:47,543 --> 00:41:51,005
Is that not humiliation enough
that you must keep me waiting so?

806
00:41:51,297 --> 00:41:53,299
Answer me, please! Answer me.

807
00:41:53,424 --> 00:41:55,342
Will you give me that water?

808
00:41:56,802 --> 00:41:58,679
I have no water.

809
00:41:59,513 --> 00:42:01,265
Old Teddy wants this war, doesn't he?

810
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,934
I wonder how long it'll take the public
to find out he's a maniac.

811
00:42:04,059 --> 00:42:06,687
Teddy Roosevelt has rabies.
Universal military training.

812
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,397
Jack, your second speech is out.

813
00:42:08,522 --> 00:42:11,233
And the ironic part of it is
that poor people, they love him.

814
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:14,195
Sure, they do.
They'll take him up San Juan Hill again.

815
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,155
You can't touch the bunny suit.
It's rented.

816
00:42:16,238 --> 00:42:17,531
Did you read the piece
on the convention?

817
00:42:17,656 --> 00:42:20,034
If the left doesn't defend Wilson,
we're gonna get President Hughes.

818
00:42:20,117 --> 00:42:21,243
Think we ought to go to St. Louis?

819
00:42:21,368 --> 00:42:23,120
I am not going to St. Louis
to defend Wilson.

820
00:42:23,245 --> 00:42:25,206
- I think we should.
- Why? What good would it do?

821
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:27,166
I don't know,
if you don't think Hughes would have us

822
00:42:27,249 --> 00:42:29,335
in a war in a few months,
it wouldn't do any good at all.

823
00:42:29,418 --> 00:42:31,045
Wilson's kept us out so far.

824
00:42:31,754 --> 00:42:33,464
Reed thought that he was a good poet.

825
00:42:33,589 --> 00:42:35,382
He was a terrible poet.

826
00:42:35,591 --> 00:42:37,843
He thought that he could write
good novels.

827
00:42:37,927 --> 00:42:39,136
Short stories.

828
00:42:39,553 --> 00:42:40,971
Of course, he was a poet.

829
00:42:41,096 --> 00:42:44,558
And not a great poet,

830
00:42:44,975 --> 00:42:47,394
but some of it was very fine.

831
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:51,649
But, as a journalist,
Jack Reed topped them all.

832
00:42:52,149 --> 00:42:54,193
- Look. Pull this up.
- Hey, Jack.

833
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:56,070
See? That's good.

834
00:42:56,403 --> 00:42:57,988
Jack, your ride's here.

835
00:42:58,864 --> 00:43:01,575
- Excuse me. I'll wait outside.
- Okay. Okay.

836
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,163
- Do you see what I mean? If one...
- Jack, the taxi's waiting.

837
00:43:10,167 --> 00:43:11,585
Yeah, I got to run.

838
00:43:15,005 --> 00:43:16,048
Bye, honey.

839
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,183
Jack Reed wanted to stir up trouble,

840
00:43:26,308 --> 00:43:28,602
he wanted to stir up trouble
for the capitalists.

841
00:43:28,686 --> 00:43:32,064
And he also wanted
to arouse the working masses

842
00:43:32,314 --> 00:43:35,776
to the necessity of some
kind of effective united action.

843
00:43:35,985 --> 00:43:40,823
In other words, I am accusing him
of either being a busybody

844
00:43:41,073 --> 00:43:44,869
or of being a fraidy-cat,

845
00:43:44,994 --> 00:43:47,204
not wanting to face things
of his own nature.

846
00:43:51,584 --> 00:43:55,045
Dear Louise, St. Louis is very hot
and very crowded with Democrats,

847
00:43:55,171 --> 00:43:58,007
all having a wonderful time
and wearing little paper hats

848
00:43:58,132 --> 00:43:59,967
in anticipation of Wilson's nomination.

849
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:01,218
I'd like to think it's because

850
00:44:01,343 --> 00:44:03,262
he doesn't want the United States
to go into the war,

851
00:44:03,345 --> 00:44:05,181
but who knows
the mind of a Democrat?

852
00:44:05,306 --> 00:44:08,184
By the way, I've decided to throw out
the poem on white lilies.

853
00:44:08,309 --> 00:44:09,768
The rhyming scheme was wrong.

854
00:44:09,852 --> 00:44:11,937
Maybe when I get back
I can start it again.

855
00:44:12,062 --> 00:44:14,607
Politics sure plays hell
with your poetry.

856
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:17,485
I keep thinking I see you.
It's the damnedest thing.

857
00:44:17,568 --> 00:44:20,070
I miss you, honey.
I miss walking on the beach.

858
00:45:04,573 --> 00:45:06,659
- Hello.
- Where's the whiskey?

859
00:45:16,085 --> 00:45:17,670
Would you like a glass?

860
00:45:26,804 --> 00:45:28,347
Don't try and decide.

861
00:45:29,098 --> 00:45:30,432
I'll get you one.

862
00:45:35,855 --> 00:45:37,398
I like your play.

863
00:45:37,523 --> 00:45:40,234
I only hope I can do the part justice.

864
00:45:40,943 --> 00:45:43,445
I think your dialogue is beautiful.
I really do, I love it...

865
00:45:43,571 --> 00:45:45,739
Then why the hell
don't you just stand still and say it

866
00:45:45,823 --> 00:45:47,908
instead of wandering all over the stage?

867
00:45:48,033 --> 00:45:50,327
You're supposed to be looking
for your soul, not an ashtray.

868
00:45:50,453 --> 00:45:51,745
Would you rather I didn't smoke
during rehearsals?

869
00:45:51,829 --> 00:45:54,415
I'd rather you went up in flames
than put out your cigarette

870
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,417
in the middle
of a monologue about birth.

871
00:45:56,542 --> 00:45:57,543
I'm sorry. You're absolutely right.

872
00:45:57,626 --> 00:45:59,420
It makes me wanna cancel
the whole production.

873
00:45:59,545 --> 00:46:02,256
I won't do it again.
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

874
00:46:12,141 --> 00:46:14,518
You keep the glass. I'll take the bottle.

875
00:46:15,019 --> 00:46:16,562
Are you leaving?

876
00:46:17,229 --> 00:46:18,689
Give me your glass.

877
00:46:30,075 --> 00:46:31,452
Are you nervous?

878
00:46:32,411 --> 00:46:35,748
- Or is that a tremor?
- Why aren't you in Chicago with Jack?

879
00:46:35,831 --> 00:46:38,584
Why should I be?
He has his things, I have mine.

880
00:46:50,763 --> 00:46:52,848
- What are they?
- What?

881
00:46:56,519 --> 00:47:00,147
The things that you have that are yours.

882
00:47:00,564 --> 00:47:01,774
What are they?

883
00:47:03,901 --> 00:47:05,486
My work, for one.

884
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:09,156
He's a real mean
son of a bitch, isn't he?

885
00:47:09,865 --> 00:47:11,158
What do you mean?

886
00:47:11,283 --> 00:47:13,577
Leaving you alone with your work.

887
00:47:14,286 --> 00:47:17,039
- You think I mind?
- You should.

888
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,376
It's the one thing
we mustn't be left alone with.

889
00:47:20,501 --> 00:47:22,962
- You may feel that way, I don't.
- Good.

890
00:47:23,087 --> 00:47:27,049
Don't let those village radicals keep you
from being what you should be.

891
00:47:27,591 --> 00:47:29,510
What do you think I should be?

892
00:47:30,177 --> 00:47:32,138
The center of attention.

893
00:47:33,222 --> 00:47:35,766
Well, you must have been
with some very competitive women.

894
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:38,310
Let's just say possessive.

895
00:47:38,477 --> 00:47:41,147
Possessive? That's something else.

896
00:47:41,397 --> 00:47:42,898
It's a waste of time.

897
00:47:43,607 --> 00:47:44,817
I'm not.

898
00:47:45,901 --> 00:47:47,987
Neither is Jack, for that matter.

899
00:47:48,195 --> 00:47:51,615
Oh, yes. I know.
You and Jack have your own things.

900
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:54,660
He has the freedom to do the things
that he wants to and so do I.

901
00:47:54,743 --> 00:47:56,745
And I think anyone who's afraid
of that kind of freedom

902
00:47:56,829 --> 00:47:58,873
is really only afraid
of his own emptiness.

903
00:48:00,499 --> 00:48:02,334
Are you making this up
as you go along?

904
00:48:04,253 --> 00:48:05,921
I'd like you to go.

905
00:48:08,507 --> 00:48:09,508
Why?

906
00:48:09,717 --> 00:48:11,051
Because I don't want to be patronized.

907
00:48:11,135 --> 00:48:13,179
I'm sorry if you don't believe
in mutual independence

908
00:48:13,262 --> 00:48:14,555
and free love and respect.

909
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:18,559
Don't give me a lot of parlor socialism
that you learned in the Village.

910
00:48:19,768 --> 00:48:23,689
If you were mine, I wouldn't share you
with anybody or anything.

911
00:48:24,482 --> 00:48:28,027
It'd be just you and me.
You'd be at the center of it all.

912
00:48:30,696 --> 00:48:32,698
You know,
it would feel lot more like love

913
00:48:32,823 --> 00:48:35,117
than being left alone with your work.

914
00:48:47,463 --> 00:48:51,050
- I hope I haven't upset you.
- Not at all. I'm grateful.

915
00:48:51,634 --> 00:48:54,053
But you seem to be looking
for something much more serious

916
00:48:54,136 --> 00:48:56,096
than what I had in mind.

917
00:48:56,722 --> 00:48:58,808
- Than what you had in mind?
- Yes.

918
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:03,229
You see, Jack and I
are both perfectly capable

919
00:49:03,354 --> 00:49:05,397
of living with our beliefs.

920
00:49:06,857 --> 00:49:09,777
But I think someone as romantic as you
would be destroyed by them.

921
00:49:10,694 --> 00:49:14,532
And I don't want that to happen.
It would upset Jack too much.

922
00:49:37,012 --> 00:49:39,431
You can't come and play in my yard

923
00:49:40,641 --> 00:49:43,102
I don't love you anymore

924
00:49:44,436 --> 00:49:46,647
You'll be sorry when you see me

925
00:49:47,565 --> 00:49:49,984
Sliding down my cellar door

926
00:49:51,193 --> 00:49:54,321
You can't holler down my rain barrel

927
00:49:54,697 --> 00:49:57,741
You can't climb my apple tree

928
00:49:59,869 --> 00:50:02,371
I don't want to play in your yard

929
00:50:03,205 --> 00:50:05,833
If you can't be good to me

930
00:50:39,909 --> 00:50:42,286
I don't want to play in your yard

931
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:44,997
I don't like you anymore

932
00:50:45,623 --> 00:50:47,875
You'll be sorry when you see me

933
00:50:48,584 --> 00:50:50,920
Sliding down our cellar door

934
00:50:52,129 --> 00:50:54,715
You can't holler down our rain barrel

935
00:50:55,132 --> 00:50:58,677
You can't climb our apple tree

936
00:50:58,969 --> 00:51:01,931
I don't want to play in your yard

937
00:51:02,431 --> 00:51:05,142
If you won't be good to me

938
00:51:08,521 --> 00:51:09,897
Wonderful!

939
00:51:27,081 --> 00:51:28,415
Floyd, I've been
waiting for this for weeks.

940
00:51:51,438 --> 00:51:53,149
Tap your sensuality.

941
00:52:09,081 --> 00:52:11,125
- Wonderful close.
- Extraordinary.

942
00:52:11,333 --> 00:52:13,127
Very good. Excellent.

943
00:52:15,463 --> 00:52:18,382
- Floyd, that's new for you, isn't it?
- Max, what about you?

944
00:52:18,507 --> 00:52:19,467
- Okay. Who's next?
- I just recited

945
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:20,843
two-thirds of my new play.

946
00:52:20,968 --> 00:52:23,179
You said it was a work
of uncanny perception.

947
00:52:23,304 --> 00:52:25,931
Oh, did I? How quickly we forget.

948
00:52:43,365 --> 00:52:45,409
- Well!
- Jack. Come in.

949
00:52:46,035 --> 00:52:47,661
News from the front.

950
00:52:47,745 --> 00:52:48,788
- Hello, Jack.
- Hello, Jack.

951
00:52:48,871 --> 00:52:50,372
- Hi, Jack.
- How was the trip?

952
00:52:52,666 --> 00:52:54,084
Welcome back.

953
00:52:54,543 --> 00:52:55,836
- Who's next?
- Nobody's next.

954
00:52:56,712 --> 00:52:58,506
Let's have a dance out of Gene.

955
00:52:58,589 --> 00:53:01,383
Jack, you're just in time
to see O'Neill dance.

956
00:53:02,551 --> 00:53:04,512
Okay. Do something Irish.
Come on, Gene.

957
00:53:04,637 --> 00:53:06,222
Yeah. Let's have it, Gene.

958
00:53:06,347 --> 00:53:08,682
- Yeah. Go ahead Gene.
- Recite something from your new play.

959
00:53:08,766 --> 00:53:10,100
Hutch says it's wonderful.

960
00:53:10,226 --> 00:53:12,728
Tell us about the convention, Jack.
How was Wilson's speech?

961
00:53:12,853 --> 00:53:15,648
Never mind the speech.
What was he wearing?

962
00:53:17,441 --> 00:53:20,569
- What about Wilson?
- Yeah. What about Wilson?

963
00:53:22,404 --> 00:53:25,741
Oh, I don't think there's any reason to
believe that Wilson's gonna do anything

964
00:53:25,866 --> 00:53:29,703
other than support the interest of the
ruling class and take us into the war.

965
00:53:29,787 --> 00:53:33,082
But as long as he says he's against it,
then I think we have to support him.

966
00:53:33,207 --> 00:53:36,335
Because he'll have to make good on
that campaign promise

967
00:53:36,418 --> 00:53:38,462
for at least a few months
and that might give us time

968
00:53:38,587 --> 00:53:40,089
to strengthen the anti-war coalition.

969
00:53:40,214 --> 00:53:43,175
But there's a lot more pro-war feeling in
the streets now than there was before...

970
00:53:59,316 --> 00:54:01,485
You want another drink, Gene?

971
00:54:06,157 --> 00:54:07,533
I guess not.

972
00:54:22,089 --> 00:54:24,258
- Good night.
- Night.

973
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:27,386
Good night.

974
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:40,107
Would you like
some cold tea with lemon?

975
00:54:40,232 --> 00:54:41,567
No, thanks.

976
00:54:42,651 --> 00:54:44,445
Well, I'll have some, anyway.

977
00:54:57,666 --> 00:54:59,960
- What's this?
- A poem.

978
00:55:00,836 --> 00:55:02,338
May I read it?

979
00:55:06,342 --> 00:55:08,052
I didn't finish it.

980
00:55:25,152 --> 00:55:26,445
Finish it.

981
00:55:32,743 --> 00:55:34,036
Finish it?

982
00:55:37,915 --> 00:55:41,460
Would that make you happy?
If I were a poet?

983
00:55:44,213 --> 00:55:45,506
I'm happy.

984
00:55:56,058 --> 00:55:58,394
- Jack.
- Why don't you get some sleep?

985
00:55:59,687 --> 00:56:00,771
Jack.

986
00:56:03,357 --> 00:56:05,526
There's something
that I have to tell you.

987
00:56:05,901 --> 00:56:08,654
- You don't have to tell me anything.
- No?

988
00:56:09,738 --> 00:56:10,698
No.

989
00:56:20,249 --> 00:56:22,209
You want to get married?

990
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,992
Okay. There we go. I'll see...

991
00:56:59,163 --> 00:57:02,792
- Oh, careful there. Careful.
- There's two more to come.

992
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,461
Two? No, there should be three.

993
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:13,469
Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry to hover like this.

994
00:57:13,594 --> 00:57:15,304
It's not that
you're not doing a wonderful job.

995
00:57:15,429 --> 00:57:18,557
It's just that I'm very concerned
about this one particular box.

996
00:57:20,893 --> 00:57:22,978
- Here. No. No.
- I'll take it.

997
00:57:45,376 --> 00:57:47,128
Where's the whiskey?

998
00:57:47,962 --> 00:57:50,923
- Lady, where do you want this?
- Oh, just put it over there.

999
00:57:51,006 --> 00:57:52,800
That'll be fine. Thank you.

1000
00:57:55,344 --> 00:57:56,387
Yeah.

1001
00:57:58,347 --> 00:58:00,641
- Anything to drink in there?
- Drink?

1002
00:58:00,933 --> 00:58:03,727
Oh, here. Thanks.
Thank you very much. I...

1003
00:58:03,853 --> 00:58:05,980
- Thank you. Good.
- Thank you.

1004
00:58:13,404 --> 00:58:18,534
Oh. Well. Let's see now. Here we are.

1005
00:58:21,454 --> 00:58:24,248
- Gene?
- No glass?

1006
00:58:24,373 --> 00:58:26,208
Oh. Let's see.

1007
00:58:27,501 --> 00:58:30,796
Well, I guess I should have
labeled these, shouldn't I have?

1008
00:58:32,465 --> 00:58:34,633
No. No, that isn't the right one.

1009
00:58:35,384 --> 00:58:36,802
Try this one.

1010
00:58:37,845 --> 00:58:40,347
Well, what are you working on, Gene?

1011
00:58:40,848 --> 00:58:42,725
At the moment, Scotch.

1012
00:58:42,892 --> 00:58:45,519
I found a cup. Will a cup be all right?

1013
00:58:45,644 --> 00:58:48,147
- I'd prefer a glass.
- A glass.

1014
00:58:50,191 --> 00:58:54,278
You know,
you left without saying goodbye.

1015
00:58:54,778 --> 00:58:58,574
That's not like you, not that I have
slightest idea what you're like.

1016
00:58:59,116 --> 00:59:01,577
Success at last. See, a... Here we go.

1017
00:59:13,088 --> 00:59:15,883
Your skill as a bartender
seems to have deteriorated.

1018
00:59:15,966 --> 00:59:18,969
- Are you nervous?
- Yes. No. I'm...

1019
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:23,098
Why should I be nervous? My God,
it's gonna smell like a saloon in here.

1020
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:40,366
- What is it?
- It's a poem telling you that I love you.

1021
00:59:41,367 --> 00:59:44,578
And that I won't be possessive
and I won't be jealous.

1022
00:59:44,703 --> 00:59:48,666
And you can sleep with whoever
you want, live with whoever you want.

1023
00:59:48,958 --> 00:59:53,045
I'll do anything that you say.
I'd like to kill you, but I can't.

1024
00:59:54,922 --> 00:59:57,383
So you can do whatever you want to,

1025
00:59:58,676 --> 01:00:00,302
except not see me.

1026
01:00:02,763 --> 01:00:05,391
Or smoke during the monologue.

1027
01:00:09,895 --> 01:00:12,815
Gene, Jack and I,
we haven't told anyone yet

1028
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:15,234
because we were too embarrassed.

1029
01:00:16,277 --> 01:00:17,403
But

1030
01:00:19,155 --> 01:00:20,614
we're married.

1031
01:00:21,073 --> 01:00:22,992
Jack and I got married.

1032
01:00:26,662 --> 01:00:30,166
- That is embarrassing.
- Yes. Isn't it?

1033
01:00:30,291 --> 01:00:32,793
We felt very silly, but we wanted to do it.

1034
01:00:32,918 --> 01:00:35,129
And it's gonna be good.
We're gonna work together.

1035
01:00:35,212 --> 01:00:36,964
We're gonna spend
all our time together.

1036
01:00:37,047 --> 01:00:38,716
That's why we took a lease
on this place,

1037
01:00:38,841 --> 01:00:40,426
so we wouldn't have to go back
to the city.

1038
01:00:40,509 --> 01:00:41,844
Does this mean that we have to cheat?

1039
01:00:41,969 --> 01:00:43,929
Or is this a free
and independent marriage?

1040
01:00:44,013 --> 01:00:46,348
- Gene.
- You're a lying Irish whore from Portland

1041
01:00:46,474 --> 01:00:49,185
and you used me
to get Jack Reed to marry you.

1042
01:00:49,685 --> 01:00:51,103
No, I didn't.

1043
01:00:51,854 --> 01:00:53,939
I just want us to be friends, Gene.

1044
01:00:54,023 --> 01:00:56,775
Oh, how genteel. That would be a
good role for you, wouldn't it?

1045
01:00:56,859 --> 01:00:59,361
"There's Louise with Jack and Gene.

1046
01:00:59,862 --> 01:01:02,448
"He's crazy about her,
but Jack doesn't know.

1047
01:01:02,531 --> 01:01:07,161
"Poor Jack. Poor Gene.
What a heartbreaker she is."

1048
01:01:12,416 --> 01:01:14,919
What a heartbreaker you are, Louise.

1049
01:01:16,378 --> 01:01:17,963
I'm sorry. I'm...

1050
01:01:20,466 --> 01:01:21,842
Where is he?

1051
01:01:24,386 --> 01:01:25,721
Washington.

1052
01:01:25,888 --> 01:01:27,515
Well, Mrs. Reed,

1053
01:01:28,682 --> 01:01:32,353
I'll do whatever you say.
What do you want me to do?

1054
01:01:34,605 --> 01:01:36,065
Wish us well?

1055
01:01:47,993 --> 01:01:49,537
I wish you well.

1056
01:01:51,664 --> 01:01:53,082
You and Jack.

1057
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,163
Jack!

1058
01:02:34,081 --> 01:02:35,249
Oh, God.

1059
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:41,005
I'm not sure whether she had an affair

1060
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:44,300
with Eugene O'Neill or not
during this time.

1061
01:02:44,884 --> 01:02:47,178
And nobody seemed to know. Or...

1062
01:02:47,636 --> 01:02:50,264
It was nobody's business, anyway, so...

1063
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:53,601
I don't know what that situation was.

1064
01:02:53,809 --> 01:02:57,271
The report was that
she and Reed and O'Neill

1065
01:02:57,396 --> 01:02:59,565
had a ménage à trois.

1066
01:03:02,818 --> 01:03:05,946
Jack, what... What is...

1067
01:03:21,045 --> 01:03:22,755
Oh, God! I swear...

1068
01:03:23,172 --> 01:03:26,050
...that we love America!

1069
01:03:26,842 --> 01:03:29,678
We love her mountains, her forests...

1070
01:03:29,804 --> 01:03:32,056
There were mutinies
in the French army,

1071
01:03:32,181 --> 01:03:35,059
there were mutinies
in various parts of the front.

1072
01:03:35,184 --> 01:03:39,230
And then, in 1917, the troops,
poorly armed,

1073
01:03:39,730 --> 01:03:42,900
poorly equipped, poorly clothed,
went back to Russia

1074
01:03:43,108 --> 01:03:44,401
to talk it out with the czar.

1075
01:03:44,527 --> 01:03:46,153
And when they got through,
there wasn't any czar.

1076
01:03:46,403 --> 01:03:48,155
Revolution in Russia.

1077
01:03:48,489 --> 01:03:51,367
This was the spring of 1917.

1078
01:03:52,284 --> 01:03:54,161
And I became so excited

1079
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:58,124
that I zigzag-jumped the benches

1080
01:03:58,791 --> 01:04:00,960
as we walked out of the park.

1081
01:04:01,127 --> 01:04:03,838
Oh, I was so happy as a young boy.

1082
01:04:03,921 --> 01:04:06,298
Revolution, the people take over,

1083
01:04:07,174 --> 01:04:08,509
down with the czar!

1084
01:04:10,469 --> 01:04:11,637
Naturally, I was happy.

1085
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:57,933
Well, haven't you made the politics
a little nebulous here?

1086
01:04:58,058 --> 01:04:59,977
- What do you mean "nebulous"?
- Unclear...

1087
01:05:00,102 --> 01:05:02,938
- How can you say they're unclear?
- Well, they're unclear to me. I...

1088
01:05:03,063 --> 01:05:04,315
Why am I necessarily attempting

1089
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:06,609
to define the politics
of a specific group of people?

1090
01:05:06,734 --> 01:05:10,112
It isn't what I said.
I think it's a vast oversimplification.

1091
01:05:12,239 --> 01:05:14,241
Oh, it's just an opinion.

1092
01:05:17,787 --> 01:05:20,289
You know,
if you made carbons of these,

1093
01:05:20,372 --> 01:05:22,500
I could take them on the train with me.

1094
01:05:22,958 --> 01:05:25,419
Wilson, of course,
was elected on the platform of

1095
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:28,130
"Keep us out of war" in 1916.

1096
01:05:28,631 --> 01:05:32,468
But in 1917, Wilson reversed himself

1097
01:05:32,843 --> 01:05:36,096
and declared war against Germany.

1098
01:05:36,263 --> 01:05:39,600
The mission at that time was to make
the world safe for democracy.

1099
01:05:40,309 --> 01:05:41,602
Reed said,

1100
01:05:43,145 --> 01:05:47,858
"This is a war for democracy?
Where is the goddamn democracy?"

1101
01:05:48,484 --> 01:05:53,280
If men really disapproved of war, dear,
we'd have stopped wars years ago.

1102
01:05:54,698 --> 01:05:56,867
Men like wars. Always have.

1103
01:05:58,410 --> 01:06:01,455
So they all went and got little uniforms,
went to war.

1104
01:06:01,956 --> 01:06:04,416
- My country is at war!
- Yes.

1105
01:06:04,667 --> 01:06:08,546
And so today, I, too, am at war!

1106
01:06:10,631 --> 01:06:13,425
My name is Jack Reed,
I'm from New York.

1107
01:06:13,801 --> 01:06:16,720
This is not my war, and I'm not gonna
have anything to do with it!

1108
01:06:16,971 --> 01:06:18,347
All right. All right.

1109
01:06:18,848 --> 01:06:19,890
All right, folks.

1110
01:06:20,015 --> 01:06:22,518
There was a lot of anti-war feeling,
of course.

1111
01:06:22,601 --> 01:06:26,063
We had no one against the war.
There wasn't a soul against the war.

1112
01:06:26,772 --> 01:06:30,693
Well, I'm not talking about saying it
to the workers any other way.

1113
01:06:31,277 --> 01:06:33,821
How do we move them?

1114
01:06:33,946 --> 01:06:35,865
Right. How do we organize them?

1115
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:38,159
The Socialist Party...

1116
01:06:41,745 --> 01:06:43,998
The Socialist Party of America
is nothing to sneeze at.

1117
01:06:44,081 --> 01:06:46,834
You think the Socialist Party
is going to take a position?

1118
01:06:46,917 --> 01:06:48,419
You boys are Reds, aren't you?

1119
01:06:48,544 --> 01:06:52,173
The Socialist Party is useless.
Jack, is that right?

1120
01:06:52,381 --> 01:06:54,508
Now, that's the truth. Jack?

1121
01:06:54,925 --> 01:06:56,010
The United States is at war.

1122
01:06:56,093 --> 01:06:57,845
Your friends are talking to you.

1123
01:06:57,970 --> 01:07:01,390
If the workers of the world act together,
they can stop the war. And I'm not...

1124
01:07:01,474 --> 01:07:03,184
This one even pisses red.

1125
01:07:05,186 --> 01:07:07,771
You ran around saving the world
until your kidney acted up again.

1126
01:07:07,897 --> 01:07:09,064
Very intelligent.

1127
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:11,108
And you're gonna keep running around
making speeches

1128
01:07:11,233 --> 01:07:12,943
until you wind up
in the hospital. Brilliant.

1129
01:07:13,068 --> 01:07:14,862
And then,
you're gonna lose your kidney. Perfect.

1130
01:07:14,945 --> 01:07:17,239
Harry, how much is the government
paying you to keep me quiet?

1131
01:07:17,364 --> 01:07:18,574
- Very funny. Keep laughing.
- Yeah.

1132
01:07:18,699 --> 01:07:20,868
That hurt, didn't it?

1133
01:07:22,077 --> 01:07:24,079
Listen, I'm gonna tell you something.

1134
01:07:24,205 --> 01:07:26,874
You're not gonna be able to keep doing
what you've been doing.

1135
01:07:26,999 --> 01:07:28,918
This is a serious condition.
It could kill you.

1136
01:07:29,043 --> 01:07:32,379
Harry, look, I want to know if...

1137
01:07:33,172 --> 01:07:35,966
Could this thing interfere
with having children?

1138
01:07:36,091 --> 01:07:39,970
- Yes. You cannot have sex if you die.
- No, come on, Harry. Seriously.

1139
01:07:41,138 --> 01:07:43,808
Are you thinking about having children?

1140
01:07:44,558 --> 01:07:47,520
Not at the moment,
but I want to be able to...

1141
01:07:49,688 --> 01:07:51,732
Is Louise talking about it?

1142
01:07:52,942 --> 01:07:53,943
No.

1143
01:07:54,318 --> 01:07:56,195
Well, just because
she isn't talking about it

1144
01:07:56,278 --> 01:07:57,863
it doesn't mean
she isn't thinking about it.

1145
01:07:57,947 --> 01:08:00,241
Don't worry. You don't make babies
with your kidneys.

1146
01:08:00,324 --> 01:08:02,076
Look, I'm gonna send you home
to Louise.

1147
01:08:02,201 --> 01:08:03,869
Tell her to keep you there,
put you in bed,

1148
01:08:03,953 --> 01:08:06,413
give you lots of liquids.
I'm gonna write it all down.

1149
01:08:06,914 --> 01:08:09,875
Look, Louise doesn't know about
this. And I don't want her to, okay?

1150
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,710
- Fine.
- So, can you give me my bill here?

1151
01:08:11,794 --> 01:08:14,588
- I don't want it sent to the house.
- Do you have any money?

1152
01:08:18,467 --> 01:08:19,510
Not at the moment.

1153
01:08:19,677 --> 01:08:22,096
Then why the hell
should I give you a bill? Go home.

1154
01:08:22,429 --> 01:08:25,933
It is my belief that socialism and peace
are inseparable.

1155
01:08:26,142 --> 01:08:29,979
And I reiterate that the Socialist Party
will stand firmly behind

1156
01:08:30,104 --> 01:08:33,357
its resolution to oppose
American involvement in this war!

1157
01:08:33,482 --> 01:08:35,818
Mr. Chairman, Louis Fraina,
Local Boston.

1158
01:08:35,943 --> 01:08:38,487
The chair recognizes
the delegate from Boston.

1159
01:08:38,612 --> 01:08:39,613
And I still want to know

1160
01:08:39,738 --> 01:08:42,533
what specific action
we are going to take against the war.

1161
01:08:42,658 --> 01:08:44,160
Your resolution is all very nice,

1162
01:08:44,285 --> 01:08:47,121
but will it stop even one boy from
being killed? I don't think so.

1163
01:08:47,204 --> 01:08:49,457
...stigmatized as unpatriotic.

1164
01:08:49,748 --> 01:08:51,834
The task that confronts us is difficult.

1165
01:08:51,959 --> 01:08:53,711
Let us hope
that we can handle it properly.

1166
01:08:53,836 --> 01:08:54,962
What's that supposed to mean?

1167
01:08:55,045 --> 01:08:56,213
Stupid!

1168
01:08:56,672 --> 01:09:00,551
I'd like to know if the Socialist Party
is gonna fight conscription or not.

1169
01:09:00,676 --> 01:09:03,512
- That's what I'd like to know.
- Will the delegate identify himself?

1170
01:09:03,637 --> 01:09:06,098
I am not a delegate, Mr. Chairman.
My name is John Reed,

1171
01:09:06,223 --> 01:09:07,683
I write for the magazine The Masses,

1172
01:09:07,766 --> 01:09:10,811
and I want to know if the Socialist Party
is gonna organize demonstrations...

1173
01:09:10,895 --> 01:09:12,980
I'm sorry, Mr. Reed.
You have no credentials here.

1174
01:09:13,063 --> 01:09:16,150
Now, this floor is reserved
for delegates, not journalists.

1175
01:09:16,233 --> 01:09:17,985
Mr. Chairman,
is the Socialist Party prepared

1176
01:09:18,068 --> 01:09:19,737
- to take a position on the draft or not?
- Hey, shut up!

1177
01:09:19,862 --> 01:09:22,156
I'm sorry, Mr. Reed.
You have no credentials.

1178
01:09:22,239 --> 01:09:23,365
Let him speak, will you?

1179
01:09:23,491 --> 01:09:25,910
Mr. Reed,
you're getting into party politics, eh?

1180
01:09:26,035 --> 01:09:28,329
I'm just trying to be a journalist.
Mr. Chairman...

1181
01:09:28,412 --> 01:09:31,582
So is Trotsky.
Let us see what happens in Russia.

1182
01:09:31,707 --> 01:09:35,377
Why don't you join the Socialist Party?
We need good people like you.

1183
01:09:35,503 --> 01:09:37,505
Big things are happening in Russia.

1184
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:41,050
As appalling as it may seem
to see socialists supporting bloodshed,

1185
01:09:41,175 --> 01:09:43,677
I can understand the necessity
of supporting one's government

1186
01:09:43,803 --> 01:09:45,095
during times of war.

1187
01:09:45,221 --> 01:09:47,973
The task that confronts us is a giant!

1188
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:51,477
In that,
we must continue our opposition!

1189
01:10:05,366 --> 01:10:08,786
- We have to give this dog a name.
- Well, she has a name.

1190
01:10:09,703 --> 01:10:11,539
What's the matter with her name?

1191
01:10:11,997 --> 01:10:15,209
- I can't find anything in this house.
- I'm not going to call a dog "Dog."

1192
01:10:15,292 --> 01:10:17,545
I suppose if she were a baby,
you'd wanna call her "Person."

1193
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:19,547
Not really.
I think I might wanna call her "Jack."

1194
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:21,048
No. No. Bad.

1195
01:10:21,132 --> 01:10:22,716
See, now this is why
I can't find anything.

1196
01:10:22,842 --> 01:10:23,884
You put things anywhere.

1197
01:10:24,009 --> 01:10:25,427
Dog! Dog!

1198
01:10:25,594 --> 01:10:27,429
She's still not housebroken.

1199
01:10:27,555 --> 01:10:29,932
You got to grab her
when she squats like that,

1200
01:10:30,057 --> 01:10:32,685
and then take her outside. That's right.

1201
01:10:32,768 --> 01:10:35,563
And then when she goes,
you've got to give her a reward.

1202
01:10:35,771 --> 01:10:37,565
All right. Now, stay, Dog.

1203
01:10:37,648 --> 01:10:39,650
Are we having garlic for dinner, honey?

1204
01:10:39,775 --> 01:10:40,776
No, no, no.

1205
01:10:48,659 --> 01:10:51,745
Why? Why, do you think
I'm using too much garlic?

1206
01:10:52,455 --> 01:10:54,874
I thought I'd put a little in the sauce.

1207
01:10:54,957 --> 01:10:56,959
Garlic doesn't bother me.

1208
01:11:08,971 --> 01:11:12,516
- That's from Gene.
- Sorry. I didn't mean to read it.

1209
01:11:13,434 --> 01:11:15,186
I didn't realize what it was.

1210
01:11:22,485 --> 01:11:25,696
He gave it to me in October.
I haven't seen him since.

1211
01:11:25,821 --> 01:11:27,531
- You don't have to explain.
- I'm not explaining.

1212
01:11:27,656 --> 01:11:30,034
- I'm just telling you it's over.
- Louise, look.

1213
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:31,827
I don't expect you to tell me
everything you do.

1214
01:11:31,952 --> 01:11:33,913
What about if you tell me something,
just tell me the truth?

1215
01:11:34,038 --> 01:11:35,831
- Jack, I haven't seen him.
- Don't do that, Louise.

1216
01:11:35,956 --> 01:11:38,876
Don't tell me that Gene gave you
a love poem six or seven months ago,

1217
01:11:39,001 --> 01:11:40,961
but you put it in a book
and you haven't seen him since.

1218
01:11:41,086 --> 01:11:42,630
I don't care
whether you've seen him or not.

1219
01:11:42,713 --> 01:11:44,173
- I just care about dishonesty.
- Oh, I see.

1220
01:11:44,298 --> 01:11:46,217
You don't care
that I had an affair with another man,

1221
01:11:46,342 --> 01:11:48,719
you just care about dishonesty?
Look who's being dishonest.

1222
01:11:48,844 --> 01:11:50,471
You care. You care so much,
you won't even talk about it.

1223
01:11:50,596 --> 01:11:52,306
- You won't even mention...
- Wanna talk? I'll talk about it.

1224
01:11:52,431 --> 01:11:53,474
You want to be honest about it?

1225
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:54,809
If I didn't wanna be honest about it,

1226
01:11:54,892 --> 01:11:56,644
do you think I'd be silly enough
to leave a poem he gave me

1227
01:11:56,727 --> 01:11:58,729
lying around in the house
in a book of Walt Whitman?

1228
01:11:58,854 --> 01:11:59,897
Why not Whitman?

1229
01:12:00,022 --> 01:12:02,733
I'm sure Gene would feel right at home
in that company.

1230
01:12:02,858 --> 01:12:03,984
Oh, no. You don't care.

1231
01:12:04,068 --> 01:12:06,362
Why the hell should I care that
you slept with somebody else?

1232
01:12:06,487 --> 01:12:07,488
Do you think I haven't?

1233
01:12:07,613 --> 01:12:09,198
I don't think we have to report
to each other

1234
01:12:09,323 --> 01:12:12,118
every time we go to bed with somebody.
It doesn't mean anything.

1235
01:12:12,201 --> 01:12:13,494
It doesn't mean that I love you any less.

1236
01:12:13,619 --> 01:12:15,955
Do you love me any less
'cause you went to bed with Gene?

1237
01:12:20,334 --> 01:12:21,961
What difference does it make?

1238
01:12:22,044 --> 01:12:24,672
I just don't think we should lie about it.
That's all.

1239
01:12:25,297 --> 01:12:27,716
- Who?
- What do you mean, "Who?"

1240
01:12:28,217 --> 01:12:29,593
- Who was it?
- Who was what?

1241
01:12:30,928 --> 01:12:32,304
Who was it?

1242
01:12:32,888 --> 01:12:34,932
What do you want, a list?
It doesn't mean anything.

1243
01:12:46,026 --> 01:12:47,194
Louise.

1244
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,447
Louise.

1245
01:12:56,912 --> 01:12:58,873
- What are you doing?
- I'm not sure.

1246
01:12:59,373 --> 01:13:01,417
- I wanna know where you're going.
- I don't want to talk about it.

1247
01:13:01,542 --> 01:13:03,878
- Well, I wanna talk about it.
- You said it all, Jack.

1248
01:13:04,003 --> 01:13:06,881
What? What did I say now
that we both haven't said 100 times?

1249
01:13:07,006 --> 01:13:08,424
Please forward my mail
to John K. Wheeler,

1250
01:13:08,549 --> 01:13:09,592
Wheeler Bell Syndicate.

1251
01:13:09,717 --> 01:13:12,094
I'll have someone pick up
the rest of my things in the morning.

1252
01:13:12,219 --> 01:13:14,180
Didn't we say that people had to give
each other freedom

1253
01:13:14,305 --> 01:13:16,390
- if they were gonna live together?
- We said a lot of things.

1254
01:13:16,515 --> 01:13:18,017
I thought
we weren't going to be possessive.

1255
01:13:18,142 --> 01:13:19,894
- I thought you loved me!
- Who says I don't?

1256
01:13:20,019 --> 01:13:21,979
You love yourself! Me, you fuck!

1257
01:13:22,771 --> 01:13:24,940
When you're not fucking other people,
that is!

1258
01:13:25,065 --> 01:13:28,861
Freedom? You mean I should just be
like you and not give a damn, is that...

1259
01:13:30,321 --> 01:13:33,032
Is that what fucking Gene means?
You don't give a damn about us?

1260
01:13:33,115 --> 01:13:36,327
I'm not packing my bag.
I wanna know where you're going.

1261
01:13:36,452 --> 01:13:38,329
- Get out of my...
- Where you going?

1262
01:13:38,454 --> 01:13:40,331
- Get out of my...
- You're not going...

1263
01:13:42,583 --> 01:13:45,503
Get away! Get out of my way.

1264
01:14:09,485 --> 01:14:12,112
- How many were there?
- Come on, Louise.

1265
01:14:14,156 --> 01:14:17,827
You don't know the first thing about
what living together means.

1266
01:14:25,376 --> 01:14:26,836
Go ahead. I know where you're going.

1267
01:14:26,919 --> 01:14:29,839
I thought you needed someone
to share your life with. But I was wrong.

1268
01:14:29,922 --> 01:14:31,590
As long as you get your two shots of
limelight every day.

1269
01:14:31,674 --> 01:14:33,217
You don't need a thing.

1270
01:14:40,516 --> 01:14:42,810
You go to hell! Both of you!

1271
01:15:09,795 --> 01:15:14,300
It could possibly have been
a matter of prestige, you know,

1272
01:15:14,884 --> 01:15:17,761
to say that you had an affair
with Louise Bryant.

1273
01:15:18,512 --> 01:15:20,306
I haven't been spared

1274
01:15:20,431 --> 01:15:24,685
the legends about men that are
supposed to have had affairs with me,

1275
01:15:25,144 --> 01:15:27,229
because I was known by name.

1276
01:15:28,647 --> 01:15:31,150
Affairs which never occurred at all.

1277
01:15:31,567 --> 01:15:34,195
It's very difficult to tell, you know.

1278
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:37,239
Do you know there is nothing
more bewildering

1279
01:15:37,323 --> 01:15:40,159
than when you get a letter
from a loony who says,

1280
01:15:40,242 --> 01:15:42,578
"That marvelous week
we spent in Venice."

1281
01:15:42,703 --> 01:15:46,248
- Yeah.
- And it happens about every two years.

1282
01:15:46,373 --> 01:15:48,250
- Yes.
- It's most extraordinary.

1283
01:15:51,796 --> 01:15:56,425
One day, I was out walking
with my aunt in Portland.

1284
01:15:57,259 --> 01:16:00,387
And she was quite something.
She was six feet tall.

1285
01:16:01,055 --> 01:16:03,599
And I said to her,

1286
01:16:03,808 --> 01:16:07,269
"What is all this ado about Louise?

1287
01:16:07,561 --> 01:16:09,522
"What do you think of her, Aunt Belle?"

1288
01:16:10,105 --> 01:16:11,190
She said,

1289
01:16:11,273 --> 01:16:14,652
"Well, she had something
that just appeals."

1290
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:19,824
That's my story.

1291
01:16:20,366 --> 01:16:22,326
- How you feeling?
- Oh, better.

1292
01:16:22,451 --> 01:16:24,161
- Here you are.
- Oh. Thanks, Harry.

1293
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:25,913
Thanks.

1294
01:16:26,288 --> 01:16:28,207
Well, we got it out just in time.

1295
01:16:28,374 --> 01:16:31,502
But since God only knows what
condition the one you've got left is in,

1296
01:16:31,627 --> 01:16:32,670
you better treat it well.

1297
01:16:33,045 --> 01:16:36,006
That means, tell that goddamn Eastman
you got to be in bed by midnight.

1298
01:16:36,132 --> 01:16:39,426
If you get an infection now, that's it!
Absolutely no salt!

1299
01:16:39,510 --> 01:16:41,554
"Dear Jack,
I'm relieved you're feeling so well again.

1300
01:16:41,637 --> 01:16:43,222
"I talked to a specialist here in Paris.

1301
01:16:43,305 --> 01:16:45,641
"And he said you can lead
a perfectly normal life.

1302
01:16:45,766 --> 01:16:47,351
"I hope you're not neglecting
your writing.

1303
01:16:47,476 --> 01:16:48,435
"Please don't spend your energy

1304
01:16:48,561 --> 01:16:50,104
"getting caught up in things
you can't afford."

1305
01:16:50,229 --> 01:16:51,730
"Dear Jack, I'm enclosing a piece
I've written

1306
01:16:51,814 --> 01:16:52,940
"on a volunteer ambulance driver

1307
01:16:53,065 --> 01:16:54,525
"from the New York City
Police Department.

1308
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:57,278
"Also, please don't keep asking me
if you can come over here.

1309
01:16:57,361 --> 01:16:58,737
"It just makes me think you have no..."

1310
01:16:58,821 --> 01:17:00,906
"Dear Jack, yes,
Wheeler's very happy with my work.

1311
01:17:00,990 --> 01:17:03,742
"Life here is so hectic and exhilarating
that I don't have a minute..."

1312
01:17:03,826 --> 01:17:05,494
"Dear Jack, don't worry, I'm well.

1313
01:17:05,619 --> 01:17:08,831
"My only problem is keeping up with
Wheeler's demands for more stories."

1314
01:17:08,956 --> 01:17:11,292
"...serial newsletter under the heading,
'Letters from France.'

1315
01:17:11,375 --> 01:17:12,626
"Please don't mention this to anyone.

1316
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:14,170
"I promised Wheeler I wouldn't
say anything to you."

1317
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:16,964
"Dear Jack, I feel I've really grown
through my work for Wheeler,

1318
01:17:17,089 --> 01:17:19,008
"and there's no reason to worry about
my being here alone."

1319
01:17:19,133 --> 01:17:21,302
Bolsheviks, Sandy. The Bolsheviks!

1320
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:23,554
Jesus Christ,
if the Bolsheviks get in, Sandy,

1321
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:26,474
you can just bend right over
and kiss your ass goodbye.

1322
01:17:26,557 --> 01:17:28,601
Because they'll pull Russia
right out of the war.

1323
01:17:28,684 --> 01:17:30,978
Right off the Eastern Front.
They quit, that's all.

1324
01:17:31,061 --> 01:17:32,855
Pete, the Bolsheviks are small potatoes.

1325
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:34,815
Russia isn't gonna get out of the war.

1326
01:17:34,899 --> 01:17:37,318
You want to walk down
the Champs-Elysées someday

1327
01:17:37,401 --> 01:17:40,529
and see 500,000 Krauts
come barreling out of Fouquet's?

1328
01:17:40,654 --> 01:17:43,574
You better hope that the Bolsheviks
are small potatoes.

1329
01:17:43,699 --> 01:17:46,410
Now, let's have another drink. Waiter!

1330
01:17:46,827 --> 01:17:48,788
Waiter, another round here.

1331
01:17:48,913 --> 01:17:51,040
Hey! Oh, God. It's Red Emma, Jr!

1332
01:17:51,165 --> 01:17:52,792
Hey, come over here!

1333
01:17:52,875 --> 01:17:55,377
Speak up, Pete, speak up.
They can't hear you in the next room.

1334
01:17:55,795 --> 01:17:57,087
- How are you, Jack?
- Good to see you.

1335
01:17:57,254 --> 01:17:59,965
God. You look 20 pounds lighter
since you lost that kidney.

1336
01:18:00,049 --> 01:18:02,134
- Oh, yeah?
- I bet you only piss about half as much.

1337
01:18:02,218 --> 01:18:04,345
Yeah, but twice as often. Sarsaparilla.

1338
01:18:04,553 --> 01:18:07,014
Jack, can the Bolsheviks
overthrow Kerensky?

1339
01:18:07,097 --> 01:18:09,809
Okay. Why don't you ask
an impartial observer?

1340
01:18:10,351 --> 01:18:13,854
Goddamn it, Jack. What the hell
you got against this war anyway?

1341
01:18:13,979 --> 01:18:17,191
Shit, why don't you bury the hatchet
with Wilson?

1342
01:18:17,316 --> 01:18:20,986
Get back into print so we can all read
some decent writing, you know.

1343
01:18:21,153 --> 01:18:24,198
- I'll drink to that.
- You'll drink to anything.

1344
01:18:24,323 --> 01:18:27,743
Well, that's right, too.
It's good to see you.

1345
01:18:27,868 --> 01:18:31,288
Jesus Christ. It's good to see you.
Goddamn, how's Louise?

1346
01:18:31,664 --> 01:18:33,207
Not so good.

1347
01:18:33,415 --> 01:18:35,209
- She's good.
- Tell her from me that I said

1348
01:18:35,334 --> 01:18:38,838
that John Wheeler wouldn't know
a story if it fell right on top of him.

1349
01:18:38,963 --> 01:18:41,257
I'll tell you.
Hey, Jack, what are you doing?

1350
01:18:41,382 --> 01:18:43,509
What the hell are you doing?
You're driving them crazy.

1351
01:18:43,592 --> 01:18:44,885
You realize that?

1352
01:18:45,052 --> 01:18:47,138
They think you're some kind
of goddamn German!

1353
01:18:47,555 --> 01:18:49,723
I love it! Goddamn, I love it!

1354
01:18:49,849 --> 01:18:51,392
Give them hell, Jack. Give them hell.

1355
01:18:51,517 --> 01:18:53,686
- Is that a sarsaparilla with ice?
- Yeah, thanks.

1356
01:18:53,936 --> 01:18:56,647
You bet your sweet patoosie,
that's sarsaparilla with ice.

1357
01:18:56,772 --> 01:18:59,817
Why wouldn't John Wheeler
know a story if it fell on him?

1358
01:18:59,942 --> 01:19:02,403
John Wheeler's a dumbbell, that's why.

1359
01:19:02,736 --> 01:19:03,821
No, he's all right.

1360
01:19:03,946 --> 01:19:06,365
I just hate to see Louise get hurt.
That's all.

1361
01:19:07,783 --> 01:19:08,868
What are you talking about?

1362
01:19:11,787 --> 01:19:13,247
Jesus Christ.

1363
01:19:14,498 --> 01:19:16,292
Don't tell her that I told you. All right?

1364
01:19:17,585 --> 01:19:19,044
Told me what?

1365
01:19:19,795 --> 01:19:22,631
Well, Ben Parsons told me
that Wheeler had to let her go

1366
01:19:22,756 --> 01:19:26,552
because she hadn't turned anything in
that he could use,

1367
01:19:26,677 --> 01:19:28,262
other than some story about a cop

1368
01:19:28,387 --> 01:19:32,099
that went over there to drive
a police department ambulance.

1369
01:19:32,975 --> 01:19:35,519
- He let her go?
- Fired her.

1370
01:19:39,648 --> 01:19:42,109
- When did you hear that?
- A couple of weeks ago.

1371
01:19:42,651 --> 01:19:45,321
No, it was a month.
More than a month and a half ago.

1372
01:19:46,071 --> 01:19:48,866
Oh, look, Jack,
Wheeler's a goddamn moron.

1373
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:51,118
Tell her she shouldn't feel ashamed
about being fired.

1374
01:19:51,243 --> 01:19:53,287
- I'm gonna see you later, huh?
- Jack, what's the matter?

1375
01:19:53,412 --> 01:19:55,998
Hell, we've all been fired.
I've been fired.

1376
01:19:56,123 --> 01:19:57,082
Hell, I'll drink to it.

1377
01:19:57,666 --> 01:20:00,085
Imagine, 65 million

1378
01:20:01,003 --> 01:20:02,755
go to war. Right?

1379
01:20:03,047 --> 01:20:05,132
10 million die.

1380
01:20:05,549 --> 01:20:07,551
10 million become orphans.

1381
01:20:07,843 --> 01:20:12,097
20 million become maimed, crippled,
or wounded.

1382
01:20:13,015 --> 01:20:16,143
You had catastrophe in Europe.

1383
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:19,146
You had a holocaust in Europe.

1384
01:20:19,814 --> 01:20:21,941
You had a desire for change.

1385
01:20:22,691 --> 01:20:23,818
Who can stop them

1386
01:20:23,901 --> 01:20:27,279
when there was
such a revolutionary sentiment? Huh?

1387
01:20:27,488 --> 01:20:28,656
Who could stop them?

1388
01:20:39,416 --> 01:20:42,128
You know, I think I'm gonna have to get
a new typewriter...

1389
01:20:45,214 --> 01:20:47,049
- What are you...
- What?

1390
01:20:50,261 --> 01:20:52,096
You look fine. Are you all right now?

1391
01:20:52,221 --> 01:20:55,266
Oh, God, yes.
Nobody needs two kidneys.

1392
01:20:55,724 --> 01:20:57,935
The second one's just for show.

1393
01:20:59,562 --> 01:21:01,605
Sorry, this isn't a very good time.

1394
01:21:06,235 --> 01:21:09,029
They're moving me
to another communications center.

1395
01:21:09,405 --> 01:21:12,533
So, I'm just not going to be able to
talk to you right now, Jack.

1396
01:21:12,616 --> 01:21:15,035
Could we just go out here a second?
Just for a second?

1397
01:21:15,494 --> 01:21:18,706
- Look, I'm on my way to Russia.
- Oh, really? Have you enlisted?

1398
01:21:18,789 --> 01:21:19,874
Very funny.

1399
01:21:19,957 --> 01:21:21,417
I know you're doing work here
that's good,

1400
01:21:21,542 --> 01:21:23,836
'cause I read the ambulance piece
and I thought that was good.

1401
01:21:23,919 --> 01:21:25,296
- Thank you.
- And I know you're working on your book

1402
01:21:25,421 --> 01:21:26,755
and I know how important that is to you.

1403
01:21:26,881 --> 01:21:28,048
But you got to have enough sense

1404
01:21:28,174 --> 01:21:30,050
if you're trying to build up
your reputation as a journalist,

1405
01:21:30,134 --> 01:21:31,677
to be in the right place at the right time.

1406
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:34,263
- I appreciate your advice.
- Well, the place to be now is Russia.

1407
01:21:34,346 --> 01:21:37,391
- Thank you. I'll remember that.
- Louise, it's chaos. They can't last.

1408
01:21:37,516 --> 01:21:39,768
They're in their third
provisional government in six months.

1409
01:21:39,894 --> 01:21:42,730
You know what that means? It means
there might be another revolution.

1410
01:21:42,813 --> 01:21:46,275
The workers are deserting the factories,
the army's deserting the battlefronts.

1411
01:21:46,358 --> 01:21:50,070
The exiles are all coming back.
The Jews, the anarchists, the socialists.

1412
01:21:50,154 --> 01:21:51,906
All of them are going back,
only this time

1413
01:21:52,072 --> 01:21:53,157
it might be the real thing.

1414
01:21:53,282 --> 01:21:55,409
And if they have
a real workers' revolution in Russia,

1415
01:21:55,534 --> 01:21:57,828
they'd have one in Germany,
and if they had one in Germany,

1416
01:21:57,953 --> 01:22:00,414
- it could happen all over the world.
- Got a match?

1417
01:22:00,498 --> 01:22:02,416
Louise, that'd be the end of the war.

1418
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,210
You don't have to tell me
what's happening in Russia.

1419
01:22:04,293 --> 01:22:06,003
- I read the papers.
- Well, come with me.

1420
01:22:06,128 --> 01:22:08,088
As a colleague,
I'm not talking about anything else.

1421
01:22:08,255 --> 01:22:10,466
Come with me as a colleague.
You ought to be in Petrograd.

1422
01:22:10,591 --> 01:22:12,551
Oh, yeah? Well, that's what you said
about New York!

1423
01:22:12,635 --> 01:22:14,553
- I was right about New York.
- No, I have work I'm doing here.

1424
01:22:14,637 --> 01:22:15,679
And I happen to think my work is...

1425
01:22:15,805 --> 01:22:18,432
It is important. But it's not important as
what you could be doing in Russia.

1426
01:22:18,557 --> 01:22:20,559
I wanna work together. As partners.

1427
01:22:20,684 --> 01:22:23,395
I don't want a partner. And if
I wanted to go to Russia, I'd go alone.

1428
01:22:23,479 --> 01:22:25,272
- I wouldn't need you to take me.
- Louise.

1429
01:22:25,397 --> 01:22:28,317
Russia is not the safest place
in the world for a woman to be alone.

1430
01:22:28,442 --> 01:22:31,320
You may be a hell of a journalist.
But that doesn't mean...

1431
01:22:35,491 --> 01:22:37,701
Louise, we'd better hurry along.

1432
01:22:40,204 --> 01:22:41,956
So, moving you out of here, huh?

1433
01:22:42,081 --> 01:22:44,500
Yes. I've been promised an interview
with General Plumer.

1434
01:22:44,625 --> 01:22:46,794
Well, I've got to run along myself.

1435
01:22:48,003 --> 01:22:50,798
- Sorry I don't have any time.
- No. I don't want to keep you.

1436
01:22:50,881 --> 01:22:53,092
I just...
Look, the seat's already reserved.

1437
01:22:53,259 --> 01:22:55,469
You've wasted your money, Jack.
I don't want it.

1438
01:22:55,553 --> 01:22:59,014
Change the date. Go by yourself.
You can use it whenever you want to.

1439
01:22:59,515 --> 01:23:01,058
Keep up the good work.

1440
01:23:02,852 --> 01:23:03,978
Jack.

1441
01:23:05,855 --> 01:23:07,148
Good luck.

1442
01:23:07,231 --> 01:23:08,315
Yeah, you, too.

1443
01:23:14,488 --> 01:23:16,323
I got a taxi waiting.

1444
01:23:42,558 --> 01:23:44,268
Jack! Jack Reed!

1445
01:23:44,977 --> 01:23:46,896
- Joe, Joe Volski.
- How are you?

1446
01:23:47,021 --> 01:23:50,107
Oh, fine, fine.
Are you going to Petrograd, too?

1447
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:52,860
- Yes. Yeah.
- Fine. Wonderful!

1448
01:23:52,943 --> 01:23:56,572
Great things are happening.
Are you traveling by yourself?

1449
01:23:58,324 --> 01:24:01,202
- I think I am.
- Well, then I'll switch.

1450
01:24:21,764 --> 01:24:23,390
We met in Chicago.

1451
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:27,520
Boy, oh, boy. Were you a speaker!

1452
01:24:28,938 --> 01:24:30,898
You don't remember me, eh?

1453
01:24:32,566 --> 01:24:34,360
Well, it's not that.

1454
01:24:35,861 --> 01:24:38,405
- Maybe I just... Maybe it's the hat.
- My hat?

1455
01:24:38,531 --> 01:24:41,242
Yeah. Maybe I just don't recognize you
in this particular hat.

1456
01:24:41,367 --> 01:24:44,954
Oh, then I'm a revolutionary
returning in disguise.

1457
01:24:45,079 --> 01:24:48,332
Well, comes the revolution,
I'll buy you a new hat.

1458
01:24:48,457 --> 01:24:51,418
- I see you're studying Russian.
- Yeah. I'm trying to.

1459
01:24:51,544 --> 01:24:52,753
Know what?

1460
01:24:55,381 --> 01:24:56,465
- What?
- I mean,

1461
01:24:56,590 --> 01:24:58,926
ask me anything you want in Russian.

1462
01:24:59,009 --> 01:25:01,178
Thank you. I'll keep that in mind.

1463
01:25:02,012 --> 01:25:03,389
Let's see...

1464
01:25:03,639 --> 01:25:06,142
Excuse me.
Excuse me, now here's the thing.

1465
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:09,603
I'd be a goddamned fool not to take you
up on this offer. So, here's what I want.

1466
01:25:09,687 --> 01:25:11,397
I want to sign my own name
to my own stories

1467
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:13,065
and I don't want to use a double byline.

1468
01:25:13,149 --> 01:25:16,026
I want to be responsible
for my own time and my own actions.

1469
01:25:16,152 --> 01:25:18,571
I want to be referred to as Miss Bryant,
and not as Mrs. Reed,

1470
01:25:18,654 --> 01:25:20,656
and I want to keep an account
of every cent we spend

1471
01:25:20,739 --> 01:25:21,866
so that I can pay you back.

1472
01:25:21,991 --> 01:25:24,201
Now, I assume you know that
I'm not going to sleep with you,

1473
01:25:24,326 --> 01:25:26,996
so just don't confuse the issue
by bringing it up.

1474
01:25:27,121 --> 01:25:28,205
That's it.

1475
01:25:29,331 --> 01:25:30,749
- Fine.
- Good.

1476
01:25:31,083 --> 01:25:32,334
You like salami?

1477
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:38,507
He says,
"Wait a minute, I have to go back.

1478
01:25:38,632 --> 01:25:40,634
"I forgot my teeth on the table."

1479
01:25:40,926 --> 01:25:42,761
He says, "Hell with your teeth!

1480
01:25:42,845 --> 01:25:45,848
"What do you think,
they're bombarding with sandwiches?"

1481
01:25:59,195 --> 01:26:01,822
After the revolution,
you'll buy me a new hat.

1482
01:26:01,906 --> 01:26:04,492
Thank you very much.
I'll keep you by your word.

1483
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:08,204
By the way, did you hear this one?
A man...

1484
01:26:26,472 --> 01:26:29,266
Lenin asks,
"Why do you let your beard grow?"

1485
01:26:29,391 --> 01:26:32,520
I says, "I want to remember
what I ate yesterday."

1486
01:26:40,402 --> 01:26:43,697
This is a hard word,
but it means "I don't smoke."

1487
01:26:43,823 --> 01:26:44,865
Okay.

1488
01:26:47,576 --> 01:26:50,746
"Are you one of the family?"
He said, "No. That's why I'm crying."

1489
01:26:57,419 --> 01:27:00,214
There's a foreman of a logging camp,
he's trying to hire a crew.

1490
01:27:00,339 --> 01:27:02,550
You know, and he goes down
a long line of very big men

1491
01:27:02,633 --> 01:27:03,717
and he gets to a little man in the back

1492
01:27:03,843 --> 01:27:05,761
and he says, "Who the hell are you?
What're you doing here?

1493
01:27:05,886 --> 01:27:08,722
"Don't you know that I need men who
can chop down dozens of trees a day?

1494
01:27:08,848 --> 01:27:10,391
"Where the hell
have you ever worked before?"

1495
01:27:10,516 --> 01:27:12,852
And the little man says,
"Well, I worked in the Sahara forest."

1496
01:27:12,935 --> 01:27:14,645
And the foreman says,
"You mean the Sahara Desert."

1497
01:27:14,770 --> 01:27:17,064
And the little man says,
"Yes, sure, now!"

1498
01:27:20,901 --> 01:27:22,862
A woman knocks at the door
of her neighbor.

1499
01:27:22,987 --> 01:27:24,113
I didn't tell you that?

1500
01:27:24,238 --> 01:27:28,534
She says, "My husband just died.
I want to sell his jacket."

1501
01:27:29,702 --> 01:27:32,580
He says,
"What's the matter with the pants?"

1502
01:27:32,788 --> 01:27:34,915
She says, "The pants, I wear."

1503
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,550
The Russian border.

1504
01:27:50,306 --> 01:27:52,016
The Russian border.

1505
01:28:17,166 --> 01:28:19,460
He's already fighting for three months.

1506
01:28:19,543 --> 01:28:23,547
Now he joined the Bolsheviks
and he's not going to fight anymore.

1507
01:28:27,218 --> 01:28:31,055
I don't think he's afraid.
There are many Bolsheviks in the army.

1508
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:33,307
And the Bolsheviks will stop the war.

1509
01:28:36,644 --> 01:28:38,312
He's 14 years old.

1510
01:29:10,427 --> 01:29:13,597
The Communists obviously wanted
peace. Rightly so.

1511
01:29:14,223 --> 01:29:17,351
Because the country was completely
unable to sustain a war.

1512
01:29:17,476 --> 01:29:20,062
There was treason
and there was corruption.

1513
01:29:20,187 --> 01:29:22,064
There was everything under the sun.

1514
01:29:22,189 --> 01:29:25,401
But certainly...
There was certainly no possibility

1515
01:29:25,526 --> 01:29:27,695
of conducting a war.

1516
01:29:27,862 --> 01:29:30,281
Kerensky was anxious to conduct it,

1517
01:29:30,406 --> 01:29:34,910
produce some battalions of women
who were going to go and fight.

1518
01:29:39,206 --> 01:29:40,541
Jack Reed!

1519
01:29:42,501 --> 01:29:44,712
Alex, what the hell are you doing here?

1520
01:29:44,837 --> 01:29:46,589
- You have someone to meet you?
- No.

1521
01:29:46,714 --> 01:29:48,507
Then what luck I am here!

1522
01:29:49,425 --> 01:29:50,509
- Lois?
- Yes.

1523
01:29:50,593 --> 01:29:51,677
Alex Gomberg.

1524
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:54,388
- Looking for accommodation?
- No. Just a hotel.

1525
01:29:54,555 --> 01:29:57,099
More good luck.
I know of an empty apartment.

1526
01:29:57,224 --> 01:30:00,352
You have transportation?
No problem. Follow me.

1527
01:30:01,270 --> 01:30:04,607
A lot of people had an idea
that Utopia was growing up.

1528
01:30:04,732 --> 01:30:07,776
I could not blame them
for being pro-Bolshevik,

1529
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:09,320
but I wasn't.

1530
01:30:09,445 --> 01:30:12,072
The one person
who was awfully ignorant about Russia

1531
01:30:12,156 --> 01:30:14,074
- was Beatrice Webb.
- Yes, she was.

1532
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:15,576
She didn't know a thing.

1533
01:30:15,785 --> 01:30:18,621
Do not be misled by the quiet
in the streets.

1534
01:30:18,746 --> 01:30:20,331
Underneath is great tension.

1535
01:30:21,207 --> 01:30:23,667
Alex, how much time
has the Kerensky government got left?

1536
01:30:23,793 --> 01:30:26,253
Any day now, the Bolsheviks will strike.

1537
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:32,426
Fantastic, isn't it?

1538
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:35,846
A quiet street,
and yet we are in the heart of Petrograd.

1539
01:30:37,473 --> 01:30:38,724
Give him four rubles.

1540
01:30:42,728 --> 01:30:45,314
Jack, Lois. Lucky for you, I am here.

1541
01:30:46,190 --> 01:30:49,527
Yeah. Thanks. Thanks again.

1542
01:30:53,155 --> 01:30:55,366
Only one bed? That's a double.

1543
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:58,786
Single. That's a single!
This is where I'II...

1544
01:30:59,703 --> 01:31:01,789
This is good for me. I can just...

1545
01:31:03,374 --> 01:31:04,458
Good.

1546
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:11,757
I don't mind this at all.

1547
01:31:24,103 --> 01:31:25,896
He's calling for an insurrection,
isn't he?

1548
01:31:26,021 --> 01:31:27,815
Day and night. Day and night.

1549
01:31:28,232 --> 01:31:30,151
"Another insurrection will ruin Russia."

1550
01:31:30,276 --> 01:31:31,819
"Another insurrection will save Russia."

1551
01:31:31,944 --> 01:31:33,654
"The war is ruining Russia."

1552
01:31:33,779 --> 01:31:37,116
"Without England or France,
Russia will be isolated."

1553
01:31:37,241 --> 01:31:39,034
"The Bolsheviks are ruining Russia."

1554
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:41,454
Lois, lucky for you, I am here.

1555
01:31:41,579 --> 01:31:43,122
Louise.

1556
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:45,666
- This is the line for bread.
- Yes.

1557
01:31:45,791 --> 01:31:47,877
There's another line for boots.

1558
01:31:48,002 --> 01:31:50,379
And there is still another line for cards

1559
01:31:50,504 --> 01:31:53,382
on which they'll get the boots
in two, three months.

1560
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:57,178
Did we have to get rid of the czar
to stand in line for bread?

1561
01:31:58,721 --> 01:32:00,848
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

1562
01:32:02,933 --> 01:32:06,020
Vosstanie means "Insurrection,"
and "Kerensky" means "Kerensky,"

1563
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:07,855
and Bolsheviki means Bolshevik.

1564
01:32:08,105 --> 01:32:10,941
So I think it calls for an insurrection
by the Bolsheviks

1565
01:32:11,066 --> 01:32:13,527
against the Kerensky government
and the kornilovtsy.

1566
01:32:13,652 --> 01:32:15,654
- What's a kornilovtsy?
- Louise, I'm not that fluent in Russian.

1567
01:32:16,906 --> 01:32:20,701
Look, if they buy this,

1568
01:32:20,951 --> 01:32:23,412
they're gonna cut you down
to 400 or 500 words, aren't they?

1569
01:32:23,537 --> 01:32:26,916
- That starts out like you got 5,000.
- Where would you cut?

1570
01:32:28,834 --> 01:32:31,587
I'd lose this. I'd lose this.

1571
01:32:32,379 --> 01:32:34,173
But what's your lead?

1572
01:32:36,175 --> 01:32:38,552
Oh, I know what you think.
You think the strongman line.

1573
01:32:38,677 --> 01:32:41,055
Well, I just don't know if you're gonna
take anybody's breath away

1574
01:32:41,180 --> 01:32:44,058
with that for a lead. You know?

1575
01:32:46,268 --> 01:32:48,896
You're right.
It's too long, it's too general.

1576
01:32:49,021 --> 01:32:51,690
And the strongman line
is the best lead.

1577
01:32:55,277 --> 01:32:58,113
You've been right
about something else, too.

1578
01:33:00,491 --> 01:33:03,536
The Bolsheviks will take Russia
out of the war.

1579
01:33:06,038 --> 01:33:08,415
- Good night.
- Night.

1580
01:33:09,208 --> 01:33:11,502
"In the streets the talk
is of peace and bread.

1581
01:33:11,627 --> 01:33:13,087
"Neither of which
Kerensky has provided."

1582
01:33:13,170 --> 01:33:14,588
"Everybody knows that
something is going to happen,

1583
01:33:14,588 --> 01:33:15,047
"Everybody knows that
something is going to happen,

1584
01:33:15,172 --> 01:33:16,423
"but nobody knows just what."

1585
01:33:18,801 --> 01:33:19,802
Yes?

1586
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:21,804
I'm sorry, I don't speak Russian.
I'm English.

1587
01:33:21,929 --> 01:33:23,264
"Petrograd does not sleep.

1588
01:33:23,347 --> 01:33:25,641
"At night, the arguments grow louder
and the crowds thicken."

1589
01:33:25,766 --> 01:33:27,184
"Nobody is satisfied with Kerensky.

1590
01:33:27,309 --> 01:33:29,937
"The far right wants a strongman,
the far left wants peace.

1591
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:32,064
"Everyone waits to see
what the Bolsheviks will do."

1592
01:33:32,148 --> 01:33:34,942
"It is not easy to write fairly about
the Bolshevik leader Lenin.

1593
01:33:35,025 --> 01:33:37,611
"He is absorbed, cold,
impatient of interruptions."

1594
01:33:37,695 --> 01:33:40,239
- You're editorializing here.
- I never editorialize.

1595
01:33:40,322 --> 01:33:42,825
- At the end.
- You're right. Cut it.

1596
01:33:45,661 --> 01:33:47,496
What I don't understand is...

1597
01:33:47,997 --> 01:33:50,833
Why did you take out the piece
about the gunshot? It was very good.

1598
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:52,084
- It is good, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1599
01:33:52,168 --> 01:33:53,794
Put it back in for me.

1600
01:34:00,509 --> 01:34:03,095
Mr. Zinoviev, do you still feel
that the timing is wrong

1601
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:04,930
for a Bolshevik insurrection?

1602
01:34:05,014 --> 01:34:07,016
"I interviewed Zinoviev at Smolny.

1603
01:34:07,141 --> 01:34:08,392
"He'd been in hiding with Lenin."

1604
01:34:08,517 --> 01:34:11,103
...had another whole decade,
less than a day.

1605
01:34:11,187 --> 01:34:13,647
"His style is still that of a man in hiding.

1606
01:34:13,731 --> 01:34:15,441
"We hear Trotsky speak at Smolny.

1607
01:34:15,524 --> 01:34:17,902
"If Lenin represents thought,
Trotsky represents action.

1608
01:34:18,027 --> 01:34:19,069
"He is essentially an agitator."

1609
01:34:19,195 --> 01:34:20,654
"The meeting hall at Smolny
was packed. At one point,

1610
01:34:20,779 --> 01:34:23,073
"someone in the platform
asked the comrades not to smoke,

1611
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:25,159
"and everybody, including the smokers
took up the cry,

1612
01:34:25,284 --> 01:34:27,369
"'Don't smoke, comrades! '
And then they went on smoking."

1613
01:34:27,495 --> 01:34:29,580
"At the point Trotsky said,
'We are trying to avoid insurrection,

1614
01:34:29,705 --> 01:34:31,415
"'but if the Kerensky government
attacks us,

1615
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:32,666
"'we shall answer blow by blow,'

1616
01:34:32,750 --> 01:34:34,668
"the audience broke into wild cheers."

1617
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:38,506
"Lenin is a strange popular leader,
a leader purely by virtue of intellect.

1618
01:34:38,589 --> 01:34:41,008
"Colorless, humorless,
uncompromising,

1619
01:34:41,091 --> 01:34:43,844
"he seems to have
none of Trotsky's force of personality

1620
01:34:43,969 --> 01:34:47,598
"or his gift for phrasemaking,
and yet it is Lenin who is the architect."

1621
01:34:48,641 --> 01:34:50,392
Kerensky is some socialist, huh?

1622
01:34:52,603 --> 01:34:55,272
"The Winter Palace of the czar, where
Kerensky's government holds office,

1623
01:34:55,397 --> 01:34:57,483
- "is vast and magnificent..."
- "It is quiet in the Winter Palace.

1624
01:34:57,566 --> 01:34:59,401
"There's no sign here
of the strikes and lockouts

1625
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:01,362
"that convulse Moscow and Odessa.

1626
01:35:01,695 --> 01:35:03,656
"No evidence that
transportation is paralyzed,

1627
01:35:03,739 --> 01:35:06,325
"that the army is starving
and in the big cities, there is no bread."

1628
01:35:06,408 --> 01:35:09,328
"Kerensky is full of old-world manners
and charm, totally unlike Lenin."

1629
01:35:09,411 --> 01:35:11,914
"'Provisional government will last,'
Kerensky said during the interview,

1630
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:13,541
"'in spite of the Bolsheviks.'"

1631
01:35:13,666 --> 01:35:15,793
"He seemed bitter, defensive."

1632
01:35:16,252 --> 01:35:19,046
900,000 men deserted
since January the 1st.

1633
01:35:19,630 --> 01:35:23,008
That's 14% of the Russian army. I...

1634
01:35:24,009 --> 01:35:27,555
I'm sort of braising the cabbage.
'Cause I thought it'd be a nice change.

1635
01:35:28,055 --> 01:35:31,308
You know that house
where Rhys Williams is staying?

1636
01:35:31,892 --> 01:35:35,104
Evidently, the banker's daughter
came home in hysterics the other night,

1637
01:35:35,229 --> 01:35:37,398
'cause some woman streetcar
conductor called her "comrade."

1638
01:35:38,732 --> 01:35:40,192
So after dinner, they all voted

1639
01:35:40,276 --> 01:35:43,070
they preferred the Germans
to the Bolsheviks by 10-to-one.

1640
01:35:43,154 --> 01:35:46,699
Anyway, the Social Revolutionaries
asked the British ambassador

1641
01:35:46,782 --> 01:35:47,908
to please not to mention their visit,

1642
01:35:48,033 --> 01:35:50,244
because they were already considered
too far to the right.

1643
01:35:50,369 --> 01:35:51,829
And you know,
it's the same group of people

1644
01:35:51,954 --> 01:35:54,582
you couldn't even see a year ago,
'cause they were too far to the left.

1645
01:35:54,707 --> 01:35:56,917
Karsavina is dancing tonight.

1646
01:35:57,001 --> 01:35:59,295
And, oh, Manny Komroff says
that Charlie Chaplin will be...

1647
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:00,588
Jack...

1648
01:36:01,464 --> 01:36:03,591
Thanks for bringing me here.

1649
01:36:15,269 --> 01:36:16,854
Will they strike?

1650
01:36:18,522 --> 01:36:20,316
Do you speak English?

1651
01:36:22,485 --> 01:36:23,694
Do you speak English?

1652
01:36:23,819 --> 01:36:24,945
Do you speak English?

1653
01:36:27,615 --> 01:36:29,283
Do you speak English?

1654
01:36:29,366 --> 01:36:31,118
Do you speak English?

1655
01:36:31,368 --> 01:36:33,162
Do you speak English?

1656
01:36:33,287 --> 01:36:34,830
- Do you speak English?
- Yes.

1657
01:36:34,955 --> 01:36:36,582
Will they strike?

1658
01:36:40,961 --> 01:36:42,129
- New York?
- Yes.

1659
01:36:42,254 --> 01:36:43,839
- You know Broome Street?
- Yes!

1660
01:36:43,964 --> 01:36:45,591
I know,
but can you tell me what he's saying?

1661
01:36:45,674 --> 01:36:48,803
- I lived there four years.
- Really? What's he...

1662
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:51,013
What is he saying?

1663
01:36:51,472 --> 01:36:53,349
Can you tell me what he's saying?

1664
01:36:53,474 --> 01:36:55,851
He says don't strike.
He says it's not right

1665
01:36:55,976 --> 01:36:58,521
to leave our Russian soldiers
at Front without guns.

1666
01:37:01,065 --> 01:37:03,442
You are a long way from New York.

1667
01:37:22,461 --> 01:37:25,172
He says that our Russian
soldiers at the Front

1668
01:37:25,297 --> 01:37:26,757
are also strike.

1669
01:37:26,882 --> 01:37:28,926
That is why they're leaving the Front.

1670
01:37:41,313 --> 01:37:42,314
What's that?

1671
01:37:42,398 --> 01:37:44,358
He said that the workers of England,
France and America

1672
01:37:44,441 --> 01:37:46,318
will be left alone to fight Germany.

1673
01:37:46,402 --> 01:37:47,611
Tell him he doesn't know
how many workers

1674
01:37:47,736 --> 01:37:49,697
in England, France and America
are against the war.

1675
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:51,323
You lived in New York. Tell him that.

1676
01:37:51,407 --> 01:37:52,950
You are right, American.

1677
01:38:00,458 --> 01:38:01,876
Go ahead, you speak.

1678
01:38:05,087 --> 01:38:06,213
Go ahead.

1679
01:38:06,338 --> 01:38:08,132
Tell them about your American workers.

1680
01:38:08,257 --> 01:38:10,801
No, I can't speak here, I don't have
any credentials to speak here.

1681
01:38:10,926 --> 01:38:13,304
- I'm an American...
- Credentials? What credentials?

1682
01:38:13,429 --> 01:38:15,264
Everyone has credentials here.

1683
01:38:15,389 --> 01:38:16,682
He ask you to speak.

1684
01:38:18,767 --> 01:38:20,519
Speak. I translate.

1685
01:38:44,335 --> 01:38:46,253
I only want to say that if you strike,

1686
01:38:46,378 --> 01:38:48,964
the American workers
will not feel betrayed.

1687
01:38:55,471 --> 01:38:57,473
They're waiting for your example.

1688
01:38:58,808 --> 01:39:00,810
They're waiting for your leadership.

1689
01:39:00,935 --> 01:39:03,771
If you refuse to support
the capitalist war machine,

1690
01:39:03,854 --> 01:39:05,397
they will follow your example.

1691
01:39:05,481 --> 01:39:07,358
And if workers of the world
stand together,

1692
01:39:07,483 --> 01:39:09,235
the war can be stopped.

1693
01:39:16,325 --> 01:39:18,911
They support you
and will join you in revolution!

1694
01:44:00,490 --> 01:44:03,660
Then, comrades, come rally

1695
01:44:03,911 --> 01:44:06,914
And the last fight
Let us face

1696
01:44:07,331 --> 01:44:10,667
The Internationale

1697
01:44:10,792 --> 01:44:13,545
Unites the human race

1698
01:44:13,795 --> 01:44:16,757
Then, comrades, come rally

1699
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:19,801
And the last fight
Let us face

1700
01:44:19,885 --> 01:44:22,638
The Internationale

1701
01:44:22,763 --> 01:44:26,183
Unites the human race

1702
01:44:26,308 --> 01:44:27,434
That's how it goes.

1703
01:44:27,976 --> 01:44:29,019
Porter!

1704
01:44:34,608 --> 01:44:36,068
Confiscate it.

1705
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:38,737
I'll take it with me to Washington
on Wednesday.

1706
01:44:38,820 --> 01:44:40,531
On whose authority?

1707
01:44:41,323 --> 01:44:43,909
The authority of the Attorney General.

1708
01:44:44,535 --> 01:44:46,370
All right, pack it up.

1709
01:44:46,495 --> 01:44:50,040
- Attorney General?
- Attorney General of the United States.

1710
01:44:50,249 --> 01:44:51,959
That's upside down.

1711
01:44:53,460 --> 01:44:54,753
- Louise!
- Max!

1712
01:44:56,004 --> 01:44:57,381
How are you?

1713
01:44:58,674 --> 01:45:00,217
Max. Hi!

1714
01:45:02,469 --> 01:45:03,637
Hi!

1715
01:45:03,762 --> 01:45:06,515
Oh, God, Louise. You look good!

1716
01:45:06,640 --> 01:45:08,767
God, whatever you've been doing,
you ought to bottle it.

1717
01:45:08,851 --> 01:45:10,352
Oh, thank you.

1718
01:45:10,727 --> 01:45:13,564
He's gonna write a great book, Max,
and I'm gonna lecture while he's doing it

1719
01:45:13,689 --> 01:45:15,023
so we can have something to live on.

1720
01:45:15,148 --> 01:45:17,109
And he's gonna write
wherever I'm lecturing.

1721
01:45:17,192 --> 01:45:18,652
And then we're gonna go back to Croton

1722
01:45:18,735 --> 01:45:20,320
and he's gonna help me edit
my collection of articles

1723
01:45:20,404 --> 01:45:21,864
on women in the Revolution,

1724
01:45:21,989 --> 01:45:23,657
and then we're gonna help
edit each other's books.

1725
01:45:23,740 --> 01:45:26,201
No more separations.
We've really promised each other, Max.

1726
01:45:26,285 --> 01:45:28,662
We're really going to get down
to living our own lives.

1727
01:45:29,121 --> 01:45:32,040
It's so moving.
God, Max, you should've been there!

1728
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:36,128
Well, they took my notes.
Every goddamn note I have for my book.

1729
01:45:36,211 --> 01:45:37,713
Can they do that?

1730
01:45:37,796 --> 01:45:40,507
Welcome home. Let's go.

1731
01:45:41,049 --> 01:45:42,718
Come on, come on.
We'll get your notes back.

1732
01:45:42,843 --> 01:45:44,219
You'll write your book.

1733
01:45:44,344 --> 01:45:46,847
A lot's been happening. Now what
the hell is going on here, Jack?

1734
01:45:46,930 --> 01:45:49,516
I understand you and Louise
have decided to be happy?

1735
01:45:49,641 --> 01:45:51,810
It's a very difficult situation

1736
01:45:51,894 --> 01:45:55,189
for a country who is conducting a war,

1737
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:58,275
when one of its allies has a revolution

1738
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:00,694
and the government is changed.

1739
01:46:00,777 --> 01:46:04,573
The thing that made the furor
was that the Russians withdrew,

1740
01:46:04,656 --> 01:46:06,575
and we lost an ally.

1741
01:46:06,992 --> 01:46:09,661
We thought the Russians
had gone back on us.

1742
01:46:10,078 --> 01:46:12,456
The Bolshevik Revolution, at the time,

1743
01:46:12,581 --> 01:46:16,043
was the most single striking
event in the history of the times,

1744
01:46:16,168 --> 01:46:17,211
of the whole era.

1745
01:46:17,336 --> 01:46:20,172
The complete transformation
of Russian society,

1746
01:46:20,255 --> 01:46:23,300
and the taking over
by the peasants and the workers

1747
01:46:23,592 --> 01:46:25,052
of the machinery of the state.

1748
01:46:25,135 --> 01:46:26,887
It never had happened before in history.

1749
01:46:27,304 --> 01:46:28,931
You're a grand old flag

1750
01:46:29,056 --> 01:46:30,807
You're a high flying flag

1751
01:46:30,933 --> 01:46:33,227
And forever and e'er may you wave

1752
01:46:33,602 --> 01:46:36,772
You're the emblem of
The land I love

1753
01:46:36,897 --> 01:46:39,149
The home of the free and the brave

1754
01:46:39,316 --> 01:46:42,402
Every heart beats true
For the red, white and blue

1755
01:46:42,486 --> 01:46:45,072
Where there's never a boast or brag

1756
01:46:45,489 --> 01:46:48,325
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

1757
01:46:48,450 --> 01:46:50,869
Keep your eye on the grand old flag

1758
01:46:51,787 --> 01:46:53,914
Over There is not till 1918.

1759
01:46:54,581 --> 01:46:56,375
Over there, over there

1760
01:46:56,458 --> 01:46:58,085
Send the word, send the word

1761
01:46:58,168 --> 01:47:00,546
Over there
That the Yanks are coming...

1762
01:47:00,629 --> 01:47:01,755
You know that one.

1763
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:05,300
But the other one
after Grand Old Flag,

1764
01:47:05,634 --> 01:47:08,846
or before, was
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy.

1765
01:47:10,389 --> 01:47:12,474
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy

1766
01:47:12,933 --> 01:47:14,518
Yankee Doodle...

1767
01:47:14,643 --> 01:47:16,979
Real live nephew of my Uncle Sam

1768
01:47:17,104 --> 01:47:19,273
Born on the 4th of July

1769
01:47:19,982 --> 01:47:22,401
I've got a Yankee Doodle sweetheart

1770
01:47:22,609 --> 01:47:24,653
She's my Yankee Doodle joy

1771
01:47:24,903 --> 01:47:27,948
Yankee Doodle went to London
Just to ride the ponies

1772
01:47:28,073 --> 01:47:30,033
I am the Yankee Doodle boy

1773
01:47:30,826 --> 01:47:32,494
That was a big hit.

1774
01:47:33,662 --> 01:47:37,165
- Do you believe in God?
- I beg your pardon?

1775
01:47:38,166 --> 01:47:41,211
It's a simple question, Miss Bryant.
Now do you want me to repeat it?

1776
01:47:41,336 --> 01:47:42,546
I'm sorry, for a moment I thought

1777
01:47:42,671 --> 01:47:44,131
you asked me
if I believed there's a God.

1778
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:46,425
That is precisely what I asked you.

1779
01:47:46,758 --> 01:47:49,678
I see. Well, I have no way of knowing.

1780
01:47:50,179 --> 01:47:51,930
Are you a Christian?

1781
01:47:52,181 --> 01:47:54,683
I was christened in the Catholic Church.

1782
01:47:54,808 --> 01:47:58,061
- Well, are you a Christian now?
- I suppose I am.

1783
01:47:58,770 --> 01:48:01,440
Do you believe
in Our Lord Jesus Christ?

1784
01:48:01,648 --> 01:48:05,569
I believe in the teachings of Christ.
Am I being tried for witchcraft?

1785
01:48:05,694 --> 01:48:06,820
Miss Bryant, tell me,

1786
01:48:06,945 --> 01:48:11,366
are there no decent, God-fearing
Christians among the Bolsheviks?

1787
01:48:11,533 --> 01:48:14,286
Does one have to be God-fearing
and Christian to be decent?

1788
01:48:14,369 --> 01:48:17,831
Senator, the Bolsheviks believe
that it's religion, particularly Christianity,

1789
01:48:17,915 --> 01:48:20,709
that's kept the Russian people back
for so many centuries.

1790
01:48:20,792 --> 01:48:22,294
- Miss Bryant...
- lf any of you'd ever been to Russia

1791
01:48:22,377 --> 01:48:24,630
and seen the peasants,
you might think they had a point.

1792
01:48:24,713 --> 01:48:26,715
On the subject of decency, Senator,

1793
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:29,218
the Bolsheviks took power
with the slogan, "An end to the war."

1794
01:48:29,343 --> 01:48:32,513
Within six months, they made good
their promise to the Russian people.

1795
01:48:32,721 --> 01:48:34,932
Now, the present President
of the United States of America

1796
01:48:35,057 --> 01:48:38,393
went to this country in 1916,
on a "no war" ticket.

1797
01:48:38,477 --> 01:48:40,395
Within six months,
he'd taken us into the war,

1798
01:48:40,479 --> 01:48:43,524
and 115,000 young Americans
didn't come back.

1799
01:48:43,899 --> 01:48:45,859
If that's how decent,
God-fearing Christians behave,

1800
01:48:45,943 --> 01:48:47,903
give me atheists anytime.

1801
01:48:50,072 --> 01:48:52,908
By the way, Senator Overman,
in Russia, women have the vote,

1802
01:48:53,033 --> 01:48:54,743
which is more than you can say
for this country.

1803
01:48:54,868 --> 01:48:56,119
Miss Bryant,

1804
01:48:56,245 --> 01:48:59,540
do you advocate a Soviet government
for this country?

1805
01:48:59,915 --> 01:49:02,084
No. In this country
I don't think it would work.

1806
01:49:02,209 --> 01:49:03,585
In other words,
you mean the Red scare?

1807
01:49:03,669 --> 01:49:06,046
They got scared, or we got scared?

1808
01:49:06,797 --> 01:49:08,257
No, we didn't get scared.

1809
01:49:08,590 --> 01:49:12,719
They were afraid that the unions
would grow in strength.

1810
01:49:12,928 --> 01:49:16,723
A radical movement in America.
They were scared.

1811
01:49:16,807 --> 01:49:17,975
Oh, sure.

1812
01:49:18,100 --> 01:49:21,770
The Americans, they were frightened
to death by it, you know.

1813
01:49:21,895 --> 01:49:23,605
That it could occur here.

1814
01:49:23,730 --> 01:49:26,942
Sure. Everybody was in mortal dread

1815
01:49:27,109 --> 01:49:29,319
of the government descending on them.

1816
01:49:29,444 --> 01:49:32,239
The FBI or whatever it was,
don't you know.

1817
01:49:32,364 --> 01:49:34,074
We had to expose them.

1818
01:49:34,157 --> 01:49:37,160
And once they told American people
what Communism was...

1819
01:49:37,494 --> 01:49:40,038
People won't have nothing to do
with Communism now.

1820
01:49:40,122 --> 01:49:41,331
They know what it is.

1821
01:49:41,456 --> 01:49:44,084
But then, they didn't know.
It was a new thing.

1822
01:49:44,209 --> 01:49:47,838
Public opinion was
solidly against anyone

1823
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:51,175
who had a good word
for the Russian Revolution.

1824
01:49:51,633 --> 01:49:56,555
But Louise was always communicating
what she had experienced.

1825
01:49:58,015 --> 01:49:59,850
I brought blankets, here,

1826
01:50:00,559 --> 01:50:02,895
and a heavy coat, here.

1827
01:50:04,479 --> 01:50:06,148
Chase and Sanborn.

1828
01:50:06,648 --> 01:50:07,608
Gloves.

1829
01:50:07,733 --> 01:50:10,777
Thank you, Jack.
Everyone else brought me hats.

1830
01:50:10,903 --> 01:50:14,948
And Louise sends you her best and this.

1831
01:50:16,742 --> 01:50:19,786
A scarf. Very kind.

1832
01:50:20,287 --> 01:50:22,289
I'm afraid your time is up.

1833
01:50:22,664 --> 01:50:23,832
Well,

1834
01:50:25,167 --> 01:50:27,544
we're going to keep fighting this.

1835
01:50:27,836 --> 01:50:30,964
Will you tell Max I'd like a picture
of myself in the magazine?

1836
01:50:31,089 --> 01:50:35,135
And under it, I would like the words,
"Deported in 1919.

1837
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:37,054
"The government of the most
powerful country in the world

1838
01:50:37,179 --> 01:50:38,138
"is afraid of this woman."

1839
01:50:39,097 --> 01:50:41,350
We're going to get you back, E.G.

1840
01:50:42,142 --> 01:50:44,895
The revolution needs you.
We're gonna get you back.

1841
01:50:45,020 --> 01:50:47,731
Comrade, I'm not leaving
the revolution.

1842
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:50,108
In Russia, I'll be joining it.

1843
01:50:50,275 --> 01:50:54,321
I urged the deportation of all

1844
01:50:56,114 --> 01:50:59,451
alien Communists.
All alien Communists.

1845
01:50:59,576 --> 01:51:02,371
It's bad enough having
a Communist with us,

1846
01:51:02,496 --> 01:51:05,290
but to have alien Communists
who are not citizens,

1847
01:51:05,457 --> 01:51:08,168
denouncing our form
of government and our republic

1848
01:51:08,252 --> 01:51:10,587
and everything else,
they should be deported.

1849
01:51:10,796 --> 01:51:13,966
And I led a big fight on that
for a long while.

1850
01:51:14,132 --> 01:51:16,802
It wasn't a very healthy atmosphere.

1851
01:51:17,386 --> 01:51:19,638
So when John Reed came along,

1852
01:51:19,721 --> 01:51:22,266
well, he was a voice of what I love.

1853
01:51:22,391 --> 01:51:26,937
He was able to go into the most
controversial subject of all,

1854
01:51:27,062 --> 01:51:28,564
Communism, Bolshevism.

1855
01:51:28,689 --> 01:51:32,693
He was considered one of the rare
persons who could do a thing like that.

1856
01:51:32,818 --> 01:51:35,779
He knew he was
on the threshold of history,

1857
01:51:35,904 --> 01:51:37,531
and he wrote it that way.

1858
01:51:44,413 --> 01:51:47,332
- A touch of this...
- Jack, I'm back!

1859
01:51:47,416 --> 01:51:49,042
I'm in here, honey.

1860
01:51:49,126 --> 01:51:51,545
I talked to Edmund and Alfred today
at Liveright's.

1861
01:51:51,628 --> 01:51:54,631
- What a day it's turned out to be.
- Stay out, honey! Stay out, stay out.

1862
01:51:55,007 --> 01:51:58,302
What are you doing in there?
Is everything okay?

1863
01:51:58,760 --> 01:52:00,387
- Can't I help?
- No, no, no, no!

1864
01:52:00,470 --> 01:52:02,347
Sure smells good. What is it?

1865
01:52:02,431 --> 01:52:03,765
Stay out, honey.
What did Edmund have to say?

1866
01:52:03,765 --> 01:52:04,433
Stay out, honey.
What did Edmund have to say?

1867
01:52:04,558 --> 01:52:07,686
He said in a few weeks
the steelworkers will strike.

1868
01:52:08,437 --> 01:52:12,399
He thinks at least 200,000 of them,
and maybe as many as 300,000.

1869
01:52:13,775 --> 01:52:16,236
But he doesn't think there's
any stopping them this time.

1870
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:17,362
Yeah? That's good.

1871
01:52:17,446 --> 01:52:19,364
You still thinking
about doing a piece on it? I am.

1872
01:52:19,448 --> 01:52:22,659
Well, I can't really talk now,
but what does he say the next step is?

1873
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:25,871
Evidently the federal government's
saying the steel organizers are Reds.

1874
01:52:25,954 --> 01:52:28,498
So what they're doing is
forming a bureau of investigation

1875
01:52:28,624 --> 01:52:30,542
just to look into subversive activity.

1876
01:52:30,667 --> 01:52:33,420
And you know, with all this talk
about the leadership of the AF of L

1877
01:52:33,504 --> 01:52:35,172
being in cahoots with the Steel Trust,

1878
01:52:35,297 --> 01:52:38,759
Alfred asked me if I was still gonna do
the piece on the IWW.

1879
01:52:38,842 --> 01:52:41,428
So I said, "Alfred, for the moment
I don't want to go any further away

1880
01:52:41,553 --> 01:52:43,430
- "than New Jersey."
- Really?

1881
01:52:43,514 --> 01:52:45,432
Oh, that's good. That's good.

1882
01:52:45,974 --> 01:52:47,601
- Just...
- Yeah, it is good.

1883
01:52:47,726 --> 01:52:50,646
Sit down. I'll just be a minute.

1884
01:52:52,397 --> 01:52:53,899
Jack, what are you doing?

1885
01:52:53,982 --> 01:52:57,653
- How did you leave it with Edmund?
- He's gonna read the piece on Debs.

1886
01:52:58,153 --> 01:52:59,988
Okay, the first course.

1887
01:53:00,239 --> 01:53:01,448
- Yeah?
- Sit down.

1888
01:53:02,658 --> 01:53:05,619
Sit down and close your eyes. Sit down.

1889
01:53:13,085 --> 01:53:14,127
Okay.

1890
01:53:17,172 --> 01:53:20,175
Oh, my.

1891
01:53:21,260 --> 01:53:22,302
My...

1892
01:53:23,595 --> 01:53:25,389
- Go ahead.
- Oh.

1893
01:53:32,896 --> 01:53:34,481
What do you think?

1894
01:53:35,858 --> 01:53:37,818
Really? You serious?

1895
01:53:39,987 --> 01:53:43,866
Really? Thank God.
I was gonna flambé them out here,

1896
01:53:44,074 --> 01:53:47,327
but the goddamn things flambéed
themselves in the pan.

1897
01:53:47,578 --> 01:53:50,664
He was certainly the main inspiration

1898
01:53:50,914 --> 01:53:53,959
in the development
of a revolutionary movement

1899
01:53:54,042 --> 01:53:55,502
through his history

1900
01:53:55,586 --> 01:53:58,172
of Ten Days That Shook The World.

1901
01:53:58,380 --> 01:54:01,633
Ten Days That Shook The World
was, of course, his masterpiece.

1902
01:54:01,717 --> 01:54:04,636
He was there when
the Bolshevik Revolution took place.

1903
01:54:05,179 --> 01:54:07,347
And his was the best report of it.

1904
01:54:07,556 --> 01:54:10,350
Max Eastman had this story
that John Reed came down,

1905
01:54:10,601 --> 01:54:14,479
tousled hair all, you know...
And said he was writing a book

1906
01:54:14,563 --> 01:54:17,024
and not to disturb him for ten days.

1907
01:54:17,107 --> 01:54:19,902
And that became
Ten Days That Shook The World.

1908
01:54:21,069 --> 01:54:22,321
Supposedly.

1909
01:54:22,779 --> 01:54:25,699
He was an enormous,
enormous success,

1910
01:54:26,325 --> 01:54:30,621
and this success
largely changed his whole life, I think,

1911
01:54:30,954 --> 01:54:33,749
'cause he found out there was
something that he could do well,

1912
01:54:33,832 --> 01:54:35,751
do practically better than anyone else.

1913
01:54:36,126 --> 01:54:39,213
"Comrades, we have made
a great stride forward in our program

1914
01:54:39,338 --> 01:54:42,007
"to capture
the Socialist Party for Revolution.

1915
01:54:42,090 --> 01:54:45,093
"The time of right-wing domination
of the party has ended.

1916
01:54:45,219 --> 01:54:48,722
"They have fallen before the shining
example of revolutionary Russia

1917
01:54:48,847 --> 01:54:50,891
"like so many bowling pins!

1918
01:54:53,435 --> 01:54:56,396
"Comrades, we have done better
than we could have dreamed.

1919
01:54:56,522 --> 01:54:59,066
"The left wing has won 12
of the 15 seats

1920
01:54:59,149 --> 01:55:01,109
"on the Socialist Party Executive,

1921
01:55:01,193 --> 01:55:05,113
"including myself,
Edmund MacAlpine and Jack Reed."

1922
01:55:13,413 --> 01:55:16,500
He took a tremendous jump forward
from there on.

1923
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:20,045
He became a revolutionist
on the workers' side,

1924
01:55:20,462 --> 01:55:23,298
and he had no more illusions
about people like Wilson.

1925
01:55:23,465 --> 01:55:24,591
We all have problems.

1926
01:55:24,716 --> 01:55:27,636
You can't escape having problems,
don't you know?

1927
01:55:27,761 --> 01:55:30,806
But to take on the problem
of all humanity,

1928
01:55:31,139 --> 01:55:33,016
to save all humanity,

1929
01:55:33,141 --> 01:55:36,270
my God, that was too big
even for Jesus Christ.

1930
01:55:36,395 --> 01:55:38,438
Don't you know
he got himself crucified?

1931
01:55:38,981 --> 01:55:41,859
How the hell do we expect
to do those things?

1932
01:55:48,490 --> 01:55:49,825
Oh.

1933
01:55:53,245 --> 01:55:55,455
Louise. Is that you?

1934
01:55:56,081 --> 01:55:57,499
Hello, Harry.

1935
01:55:58,500 --> 01:56:01,670
Well, where have you been lately?
I haven't seen you in a long time.

1936
01:56:01,795 --> 01:56:03,839
That's right.
Is this thing gonna last all day?

1937
01:56:03,964 --> 01:56:05,632
It might. We've been kicked out.

1938
01:56:05,757 --> 01:56:08,260
- Kicked out of what?
- The Socialist Party.

1939
01:56:08,343 --> 01:56:10,804
- Wait, wait. Who got kicked out?
- Everybody in that room.

1940
01:56:10,888 --> 01:56:12,639
The Executive Committee
kicked us all out.

1941
01:56:12,723 --> 01:56:16,393
- The whole left wing?
- That's right. They nullified the election.

1942
01:56:16,643 --> 01:56:18,437
- Can they do that?
- They've done it.

1943
01:56:18,520 --> 01:56:19,855
We're the majority. We have the votes.

1944
01:56:19,980 --> 01:56:21,356
We weren't expelled
by the membership.

1945
01:56:21,481 --> 01:56:22,983
We were expelled by the executives.

1946
01:56:23,066 --> 01:56:24,735
And you're talking about doing exactly

1947
01:56:24,860 --> 01:56:26,695
what the Executive Committee
wants us to do.

1948
01:56:26,778 --> 01:56:28,572
Give the party back to them
without a fight!

1949
01:56:28,697 --> 01:56:30,949
Yes! And organize our own party!

1950
01:56:31,033 --> 01:56:33,911
Goddamn it, Louis,
the Socialist Party is our own party!

1951
01:56:34,036 --> 01:56:36,246
We were voted into power
by its membership

1952
01:56:36,371 --> 01:56:38,332
and we can't be expelled
by the executives.

1953
01:56:38,415 --> 01:56:41,877
It's an illegal act, and if we fight it
at the convention, we'll win.

1954
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:43,086
Why do we have to fight?

1955
01:56:43,212 --> 01:56:44,421
What do you mean,
"Why do we have to fight?"

1956
01:56:44,546 --> 01:56:46,048
For what do we stay in a party

1957
01:56:46,173 --> 01:56:49,801
in which we must win control
from the minority, not once, but twice?

1958
01:56:49,885 --> 01:56:52,387
Well, what is it, Louis? You mean,
if we must fight for what we deserve,

1959
01:56:52,513 --> 01:56:55,307
then to hell with it?
Is that your idea of revolution?

1960
01:56:55,390 --> 01:56:58,101
I'd like to hear more about
your revolutionary concept, Louis.

1961
01:56:58,227 --> 01:57:01,355
My idea of revolution
is not a revolution in my own party!

1962
01:57:01,438 --> 01:57:05,442
And my idea of a socialist party
is not a debating society!

1963
01:57:05,567 --> 01:57:07,110
It is a party of action!

1964
01:57:07,236 --> 01:57:09,363
Fine! Fine.

1965
01:57:10,072 --> 01:57:13,033
The best example we can give them
is go to that convention

1966
01:57:13,116 --> 01:57:14,493
and take control of the party!

1967
01:57:14,576 --> 01:57:16,578
No! We form our own party!

1968
01:57:16,662 --> 01:57:19,998
And I hope that everybody here
who believe in Bolshevism

1969
01:57:20,082 --> 01:57:23,377
will be there that night
to help found that party!

1970
01:57:27,965 --> 01:57:29,883
All right, but I say you're wrong,

1971
01:57:29,967 --> 01:57:33,262
and I say that I'm gonna be there
at that Socialist Party convention

1972
01:57:33,345 --> 01:57:36,765
to take the seat that belongs to me,
and I urge everyone here today

1973
01:57:36,849 --> 01:57:39,560
to be there to take the seats
that belong to you!

1974
01:57:40,936 --> 01:57:43,272
It's almost like they want to be
separated from the masses.

1975
01:57:43,355 --> 01:57:45,691
They do want to be separated
from the masses. That's the point.

1976
01:57:46,108 --> 01:57:47,276
Let's go.

1977
01:57:48,944 --> 01:57:51,071
I've been in a minority before.

1978
01:57:52,322 --> 01:57:53,448
Hello.

1979
01:57:59,955 --> 01:58:01,498
While he liked the draft manifesto,

1980
01:58:01,623 --> 01:58:03,458
he's a bit nervous
about the social-patriot clause.

1981
01:58:03,542 --> 01:58:05,252
- Excuse me.
- Tactically, he's gonna be trouble.

1982
01:58:05,377 --> 01:58:07,171
Is he gonna bring his people
to the convention or not?

1983
01:58:07,296 --> 01:58:08,672
The man will talk theory
with you all year.

1984
01:58:08,797 --> 01:58:10,549
Well, I don't think so.
He'll go with Fraina.

1985
01:58:10,632 --> 01:58:13,468
Isn't that nice? He likes the manifesto.
How about Carnofsky?

1986
01:58:13,594 --> 01:58:15,804
I don't think we're gonna have
as much support as we thought, Jack.

1987
01:58:15,929 --> 01:58:17,806
We're gonna get in.
What did Carnofsky say?

1988
01:58:17,890 --> 01:58:19,683
- Carnofsky said no.
- I'm telling you, Jack...

1989
01:58:19,808 --> 01:58:21,977
- Just knowing on our own...
- Half of Fraina's people would come...

1990
01:58:22,102 --> 01:58:25,105
Come in!
Louise, please keep her quiet, will you?

1991
01:58:25,272 --> 01:58:26,440
- Hi, Eddie.
- How can...

1992
01:58:26,523 --> 01:58:29,193
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Louise, Ben.

1993
01:58:29,318 --> 01:58:30,277
Hey.

1994
01:58:31,486 --> 01:58:32,905
Eddie, what about Levine?

1995
01:58:35,324 --> 01:58:37,409
- Eddie?
- Yeah.

1996
01:58:38,118 --> 01:58:41,205
- What did Levine say?
- He never showed. He...

1997
01:58:41,663 --> 01:58:43,248
I waited over an hour.

1998
01:58:43,332 --> 01:58:45,667
- Levine didn't show.
- That doesn't sound like Levine.

1999
01:58:45,792 --> 01:58:47,628
Sure it does. Where were you meeting?

2000
01:58:47,711 --> 01:58:48,795
In Casey's.

2001
01:58:48,879 --> 01:58:51,840
Now, that surprises me.
That really surprises me.

2002
01:58:52,216 --> 01:58:54,092
I could have missed him.

2003
01:58:55,427 --> 01:58:56,720
It was really busy in there.

2004
01:58:56,845 --> 01:58:58,597
- You could have missed him?
- What's that supposed to mean?

2005
01:58:59,848 --> 01:59:01,058
I was late.

2006
01:59:02,726 --> 01:59:03,977
How late?

2007
01:59:06,980 --> 01:59:08,982
Forty, forty-five minutes.

2008
01:59:09,983 --> 01:59:12,861
Nora started spitting up blood
again this morning.

2009
01:59:15,572 --> 01:59:16,823
I had to take her to the clinic,

2010
01:59:16,949 --> 01:59:20,494
and I had to wait for my mother
to come and pick up the kid.

2011
01:59:20,869 --> 01:59:22,788
So you were 45 minutes late.

2012
01:59:24,289 --> 01:59:26,917
Yeah. I thought I could make it.
I really did.

2013
01:59:27,042 --> 01:59:29,169
All right, we gotta get in touch
with the guy. How do we do it?

2014
01:59:29,253 --> 01:59:30,796
He's on his way to Chicago.

2015
01:59:30,879 --> 01:59:33,173
That's one of the reasons
I thought he would still be there.

2016
01:59:33,257 --> 01:59:34,842
Wait a minute,
you thought he'd still be there?

2017
01:59:36,009 --> 01:59:38,595
- Yeah.
- Who asked for the meeting, Eddie?

2018
01:59:39,221 --> 01:59:41,181
- Who asked for the meeting?
- Who asked for the meeting?

2019
01:59:41,265 --> 01:59:43,559
- Did Levine want the meeting?
- Yeah, I thought he wanted it.

2020
01:59:43,725 --> 01:59:45,185
Did he call us?

2021
01:59:45,894 --> 01:59:46,854
No. We called him.

2022
01:59:46,979 --> 01:59:49,690
Then why would he wait?
We wanted the meeting.

2023
01:59:55,737 --> 01:59:56,864
I'm sorry.

2024
01:59:56,989 --> 01:59:59,575
Well, why didn't you call one of us
and get somebody to take your place?

2025
02:00:00,993 --> 02:00:02,911
Because I thought I could make it.

2026
02:00:03,036 --> 02:00:04,538
I mean, I thought the man
would still be there.

2027
02:00:04,663 --> 02:00:08,375
You thought, you thought, you thought.
Try not to think too much, Eddie.

2028
02:00:08,458 --> 02:00:11,295
Not when your comrades
are depending on you.

2029
02:00:12,379 --> 02:00:13,547
Be sure.

2030
02:00:18,927 --> 02:00:20,053
All right, look.

2031
02:00:20,179 --> 02:00:22,973
Do we have a contact
for Levine in Chicago?

2032
02:00:23,182 --> 02:00:24,433
Let's call Singer.

2033
02:00:24,558 --> 02:00:27,060
- Do you have a number for him?
- Yeah. Well, I've probably got it.

2034
02:00:30,314 --> 02:00:31,607
Here.

2035
02:00:32,900 --> 02:00:34,109
Thanks.

2036
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:36,528
You know, they might work better

2037
02:00:36,612 --> 02:00:39,740
if you put something in your stomach
besides coffee.

2038
02:00:40,532 --> 02:00:43,452
You're a little hard on Eddie,
aren't you, under the circumstances?

2039
02:00:43,535 --> 02:00:45,454
You think my sympathies
can help Eddie's wife?

2040
02:00:45,579 --> 02:00:47,122
Might help Eddie.

2041
02:00:47,247 --> 02:00:50,250
Listen to me.
Building a party will help Eddie.

2042
02:00:57,966 --> 02:00:59,718
Four, eight, twelve...

2043
02:01:06,642 --> 02:01:09,937
You know, I think we all believe
in the same things.

2044
02:01:12,606 --> 02:01:13,982
But with us,

2045
02:01:15,817 --> 02:01:18,153
it's more or less our good intentions.

2046
02:01:20,531 --> 02:01:22,741
And with Jack, it's a religion.

2047
02:01:32,125 --> 02:01:35,003
Our old friend Jack's
getting serious on us.

2048
02:01:40,008 --> 02:01:41,635
Okay. Hey, Frank, how are you?

2049
02:01:41,718 --> 02:01:43,011
How are you?

2050
02:01:46,473 --> 02:01:48,433
Excuse me. What's happening here?

2051
02:01:48,517 --> 02:01:51,353
No one's admitted without a red card.
That's the order of the Executive.

2052
02:01:51,478 --> 02:01:53,772
Well, I'm on the Executive,
so is he, so is he...

2053
02:01:53,856 --> 02:01:56,358
- No one's admitted without a red card.
- Where do we get the red cards?

2054
02:01:56,483 --> 02:01:58,360
You'll have to take that up
with the Credentials Committee.

2055
02:01:58,443 --> 02:01:59,695
And where's
the Credentials Committee?

2056
02:01:59,695 --> 02:02:00,028
And where's
the Credentials Committee?

2057
02:02:00,153 --> 02:02:01,572
I don't know.

2058
02:02:02,072 --> 02:02:04,116
I don't think he wants us to go in there.

2059
02:02:04,199 --> 02:02:06,118
Well, the way to take the hall
is to take the hall.

2060
02:02:06,201 --> 02:02:07,536
Edmund!

2061
02:02:07,619 --> 02:02:09,037
Edmund! Jack!

2062
02:02:09,746 --> 02:02:13,166
Okay. Let's go. Let's go.
Come on, this way!

2063
02:02:16,712 --> 02:02:19,882
To propose the agenda,
I would like to read a message

2064
02:02:20,007 --> 02:02:23,635
from the Credentials Committee
to the floor.

2065
02:02:23,760 --> 02:02:26,847
May we please have order back there?

2066
02:02:27,556 --> 02:02:29,641
In the back of the hall, could we have...

2067
02:02:29,725 --> 02:02:33,228
Sergeant-at-arms, would you see
what's going on back there?

2068
02:02:33,687 --> 02:02:37,149
Ladies and gentlemen, it seems
we have a group of intruders

2069
02:02:37,232 --> 02:02:39,610
who are trying to take over
this conference.

2070
02:02:39,860 --> 02:02:41,820
We're not going to let them.

2071
02:02:41,904 --> 02:02:45,699
Now, please, please sit down.
I need these aisles clear.

2072
02:02:45,782 --> 02:02:48,952
Sergeant-at-arms,
I must have these aisles clear!

2073
02:02:49,077 --> 02:02:50,913
Please, everyone, sit down.

2074
02:02:51,163 --> 02:02:54,041
Now, these are Bolshevik sympathizers

2075
02:02:54,124 --> 02:02:58,212
who are trying to take over this party,
and we're not going to let them.

2076
02:02:58,420 --> 02:03:00,255
The police are coming.

2077
02:03:01,215 --> 02:03:06,053
These people aren't socialists.
These people are just thugs!

2078
02:03:06,428 --> 02:03:08,764
Now you see? That is Bolshevik tactics!

2079
02:03:08,847 --> 02:03:10,849
Come on, delegates.
These people are imposters!

2080
02:03:10,933 --> 02:03:13,060
They were not elected
to the leadership of this party.

2081
02:03:13,185 --> 02:03:15,270
Ladies and gentlemen,
the police are coming!

2082
02:03:16,688 --> 02:03:19,024
- You see? The police.
- What the hell is this?

2083
02:03:19,107 --> 02:03:22,110
That's the only way the Executive
Committee can stay in power,

2084
02:03:22,236 --> 02:03:23,946
is by the use of the capitalist police.

2085
02:03:24,071 --> 02:03:25,280
Flash your red cards!

2086
02:03:25,405 --> 02:03:27,824
They'll resort to any tactics
to keep the working class

2087
02:03:27,950 --> 02:03:31,286
away from its true leadership
because they're afraid of revolution!

2088
02:03:31,411 --> 02:03:35,707
Officers, whoever has no red card
does not belong in this room.

2089
02:03:35,791 --> 02:03:36,917
Hold up your red cards.

2090
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,628
It's all right. We're going.
You don't have to throw us out.

2091
02:03:39,753 --> 02:03:41,421
If you want to know
where the true leadership

2092
02:03:41,547 --> 02:03:43,173
of the Socialist Party of America is,

2093
02:03:43,298 --> 02:03:46,176
it'll be in the basement of this building
in five minutes...

2094
02:03:46,301 --> 02:03:49,054
- Red cards, everybody!
...and you're welcome to join us.

2095
02:03:49,137 --> 02:03:52,975
I want anybody who does not have
a red card to be out of this hall.

2096
02:04:40,522 --> 02:04:43,609
Comrade Chairman, I move that
we immediately constitute ourselves

2097
02:04:43,692 --> 02:04:45,360
as the bona fide Communist party,

2098
02:04:45,485 --> 02:04:47,738
and that we call ourselves
the Communist Labor Party of America.

2099
02:04:47,863 --> 02:04:48,822
I second that motion!

2100
02:04:48,947 --> 02:04:51,074
Well, look, if we're gonna have
a really revolutionary party,

2101
02:04:51,200 --> 02:04:53,827
I think what we have to do
is to find out from the American worker

2102
02:04:53,952 --> 02:04:56,663
what he wants the most and then
we have to translate it back to him

2103
02:04:56,788 --> 02:04:58,665
in terms of the labor movement
as a whole.

2104
02:04:58,749 --> 02:05:00,334
What we have to do
is make him want more.

2105
02:05:00,417 --> 02:05:03,170
We have to make him want
the whole goddamn revolution.

2106
02:05:03,253 --> 02:05:05,797
Those people upstairs
think that Karl Marx was somebody

2107
02:05:05,881 --> 02:05:07,508
who wrote a good antitrust law.

2108
02:05:07,633 --> 02:05:09,801
And whether we call our party
the Socialist Labor Party

2109
02:05:09,885 --> 02:05:12,137
or the Real Socialist Communist...
Whatever we call the party,

2110
02:05:12,221 --> 02:05:14,431
it doesn't matter because it...

2111
02:05:15,474 --> 02:05:17,184
Hello, Lou, are you lost?

2112
02:05:17,309 --> 02:05:20,270
No. I'm not lost.
I'm here to tell my friends

2113
02:05:20,395 --> 02:05:22,940
that the newly-formed
Communist Party of America

2114
02:05:23,065 --> 02:05:26,276
is meeting at the Russian Federation
on Blue Island Avenue.

2115
02:05:26,401 --> 02:05:28,487
We welcome your applications.

2116
02:05:28,612 --> 02:05:31,156
They will be judged
on an individual basis.

2117
02:05:31,240 --> 02:05:32,908
You're gonna judge our applications?

2118
02:05:33,033 --> 02:05:34,952
We're gonna apply to you
for membership?

2119
02:05:35,077 --> 02:05:37,454
Comrade Chairman,
I'd like to call that question, please.

2120
02:05:37,579 --> 02:05:39,289
The motion has been made
and seconded that

2121
02:05:39,414 --> 02:05:42,876
we immediately constitute ourselves
as the bona fide Communist party

2122
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:46,004
and that we call ourselves
the Communist Labor Party of America.

2123
02:05:46,088 --> 02:05:48,507
All those in favor,
please signify by saying aye.

2124
02:05:48,590 --> 02:05:49,633
Aye!

2125
02:05:49,758 --> 02:05:51,635
Opposed? Motion is carried.

2126
02:05:53,262 --> 02:05:54,888
Comrades! Comrades!

2127
02:05:54,972 --> 02:05:58,767
Comrades, this is the wrong time
to be fighting against one another.

2128
02:05:58,851 --> 02:06:01,895
We should be united in our struggle
against the capitalists.

2129
02:06:01,979 --> 02:06:04,064
You should have thought of that
six weeks ago, Louis.

2130
02:06:04,147 --> 02:06:06,692
If your people had stayed with us,
we'd have had a majority,

2131
02:06:06,775 --> 02:06:08,569
and we'd be in control
of that convention upstairs.

2132
02:06:08,652 --> 02:06:10,362
We have five times your membership!

2133
02:06:10,445 --> 02:06:12,948
Louis, your arithmetic's
something like your politics.

2134
02:06:13,073 --> 02:06:16,618
We will be at the Russian Federation
on Blue Island Avenue.

2135
02:06:16,785 --> 02:06:18,412
I hope to see some of you there.

2136
02:06:18,537 --> 02:06:20,956
Comrade Chairman, I move we
immediately send a delegate to Moscow

2137
02:06:21,081 --> 02:06:22,583
to gain recognition by the Comintern

2138
02:06:22,708 --> 02:06:24,251
for the Communist Labor Party
of America,

2139
02:06:24,376 --> 02:06:27,004
- and that delegate be Jack Reed.
- Second the motion!

2140
02:06:27,129 --> 02:06:29,131
The motion has been made
and seconded to send Jack Reed

2141
02:06:29,256 --> 02:06:31,258
to Moscow immediately
as the international delegate

2142
02:06:31,341 --> 02:06:33,302
to obtain recognition of the Comintern

2143
02:06:33,427 --> 02:06:35,596
for the Communist Labor Party
of America.

2144
02:06:35,721 --> 02:06:37,764
All those in favor,
please signify by saying aye.

2145
02:06:37,848 --> 02:06:38,849
Aye!

2146
02:06:38,974 --> 02:06:41,018
Opposed? Motion is carried.

2147
02:06:42,227 --> 02:06:44,813
Since the first question
I'm going to be asked...

2148
02:06:44,938 --> 02:06:46,148
All right, thank you.

2149
02:06:46,273 --> 02:06:48,692
All right, comrades, since
the first question I'm gonna be asked

2150
02:06:48,817 --> 02:06:51,570
by the Comintern is gonna be
about membership eligibility,

2151
02:06:51,653 --> 02:06:54,364
I think I'm gonna have to be very clear
what our position is

2152
02:06:54,489 --> 02:06:56,408
in relation to
the Foreign Language Federation.

2153
02:06:56,491 --> 02:06:58,744
I'm gonna have to say exactly
what our requirements are

2154
02:06:58,827 --> 02:07:00,120
as opposed to any other group,

2155
02:07:00,204 --> 02:07:02,873
and I think we'll have to make it clear
on our Platform Committee

2156
02:07:02,998 --> 02:07:04,333
and be very clear in the manifesto.

2157
02:07:04,458 --> 02:07:05,667
- Good luck in Moscow, Jack!
- Okay, Harry.

2158
02:07:05,792 --> 02:07:08,545
Well, I guess you boys think
you can run a newspaper without me.

2159
02:07:22,518 --> 02:07:23,977
Hello, Jessie.

2160
02:07:27,022 --> 02:07:28,023
Good girl.

2161
02:07:30,692 --> 02:07:32,361
- Hello.
- Hello.

2162
02:08:09,439 --> 02:08:12,901
Let me make it easy for you, Jack.
I'm not going with you.

2163
02:08:19,783 --> 02:08:22,870
And if you go, I'm not sure I'll be here
when you get back.

2164
02:08:24,204 --> 02:08:29,001
Louise, you know, the Comintern
doesn't know Edmund or Alfred

2165
02:08:29,084 --> 02:08:31,086
from the New York Yankees.
They know me.

2166
02:08:31,211 --> 02:08:33,714
Somebody's got to go over there
who's got a background.

2167
02:08:37,551 --> 02:08:39,511
We'd be back by Christmas.

2168
02:08:43,765 --> 02:08:45,225
We can't merge with Fraina.

2169
02:08:45,309 --> 02:08:47,186
We can't deal with him
on membership eligibility.

2170
02:08:47,269 --> 02:08:49,396
He wouldn't accept half of our people.

2171
02:08:49,479 --> 02:08:51,732
The man is gonna do nothing
but alienate himself

2172
02:08:51,857 --> 02:08:54,318
from any potential
broad base of support.

2173
02:08:54,443 --> 02:08:55,903
He's sociologically isolated,

2174
02:08:56,028 --> 02:08:57,571
programmatically he's impossible
to deal with...

2175
02:08:57,654 --> 02:08:59,615
You mean he's a foreigner?

2176
02:08:59,948 --> 02:09:01,366
Don't do that, Louise.

2177
02:09:01,450 --> 02:09:02,826
Six months ago, you were friends.

2178
02:09:02,951 --> 02:09:04,411
These people can barely speak English.

2179
02:09:04,494 --> 02:09:06,955
They don't even want to be integrated
into American life.

2180
02:09:07,372 --> 02:09:09,583
The Foreign Language Federations
aren't gonna create Bolshevism

2181
02:09:09,666 --> 02:09:12,336
in America any more
than eating borscht will.

2182
02:09:12,461 --> 02:09:14,004
Being Russian
doesn't make a revolution.

2183
02:09:14,129 --> 02:09:15,255
Do you think the American workers

2184
02:09:15,339 --> 02:09:16,924
are gonna be led
by the Russian federations?

2185
02:09:17,007 --> 02:09:19,051
Or an insular Italian like Louis Fraina?

2186
02:09:19,134 --> 02:09:21,637
He has no possibility
of leading a revolution in this country.

2187
02:09:21,720 --> 02:09:22,888
Unlike you?

2188
02:09:22,971 --> 02:09:24,765
I'm just saying
that the revolution in this country

2189
02:09:24,890 --> 02:09:26,183
is not gonna be led by immigrants.

2190
02:09:26,308 --> 02:09:30,812
Revolution? In this country?
When, Jack? Just after Christmas?

2191
02:09:31,104 --> 02:09:33,023
Well, what do you think
we could've done with the steel strike

2192
02:09:33,148 --> 02:09:34,149
if we'd been ready?

2193
02:09:34,274 --> 02:09:37,653
30,000 party members all armed
with a unified theory and program

2194
02:09:37,778 --> 02:09:40,113
leading 365,000 steelworkers?

2195
02:09:40,197 --> 02:09:41,949
What it takes is leadership.

2196
02:09:42,074 --> 02:09:44,409
And we gotta get it
by getting recognition from Moscow.

2197
02:09:44,493 --> 02:09:45,953
- I have to go.
- You don't have to go.

2198
02:09:46,036 --> 02:09:48,789
You want to go. You want to go running
all over the world ranting and raving

2199
02:09:48,914 --> 02:09:51,291
and making resolutions
and organizing caucuses.

2200
02:09:51,375 --> 02:09:53,168
What's the difference
between the Communist Party

2201
02:09:53,293 --> 02:09:54,586
and the Communist Labor Party

2202
02:09:54,711 --> 02:09:56,922
except that you're running one
and he's running the other?

2203
02:09:57,005 --> 02:09:59,174
- I've made a commitment.
- To what?

2204
02:10:00,175 --> 02:10:02,886
To the fine distinction between
which half of the left of the left

2205
02:10:03,011 --> 02:10:06,306
is recognized by Moscow as
the real Communist Party in America?

2206
02:10:06,390 --> 02:10:09,601
To petty political squabbling between
humorless and hack politicians

2207
02:10:09,685 --> 02:10:11,854
just wasting their time
on left-wing dogma?

2208
02:10:12,646 --> 02:10:14,690
To getting the endorsement
of a committee in Russia

2209
02:10:14,815 --> 02:10:15,941
you call the International

2210
02:10:16,024 --> 02:10:18,569
for your group of 14 intellectual friends
in the basement

2211
02:10:18,694 --> 02:10:20,988
who are supposed to tell the workers
of this country what they want,

2212
02:10:21,071 --> 02:10:22,614
whether they want it or not?

2213
02:10:30,372 --> 02:10:31,748
Write, Jack.

2214
02:10:34,042 --> 02:10:36,170
You're not a politician, you're a writer.

2215
02:10:36,253 --> 02:10:38,005
And your writing has done more
for the revolution

2216
02:10:38,088 --> 02:10:40,841
than 20 years of this infighting can do,
and you know it.

2217
02:10:41,884 --> 02:10:43,760
You're an artist, Jack.

2218
02:11:06,283 --> 02:11:07,534
Don't go.

2219
02:11:08,660 --> 02:11:11,371
Don't run away
from what you do the best.

2220
02:11:14,917 --> 02:11:16,001
Jack.

2221
02:11:25,719 --> 02:11:27,387
I'll be back by Christmas.

2222
02:11:53,372 --> 02:11:56,083
I'm going into the city.
When do you leave?

2223
02:11:56,208 --> 02:11:57,417
Tomorrow.

2224
02:11:58,126 --> 02:12:00,504
- I see.
- I'll be back by Christmas.

2225
02:12:01,463 --> 02:12:03,090
Will you be here?

2226
02:12:06,009 --> 02:12:08,846
I don't know. I'll see you when I see you.

2227
02:12:25,404 --> 02:12:29,241
Here. Your passport and papers.
Your name's James Gormley.

2228
02:12:30,993 --> 02:12:32,160
Go now!

2229
02:13:16,538 --> 02:13:20,167
Well, Mrs. Reed. Sit down.

2230
02:13:21,043 --> 02:13:22,794
What can I do for you?

2231
02:13:22,878 --> 02:13:25,881
Hello, Gene. How are you?

2232
02:13:27,049 --> 02:13:29,927
Fine. And you?

2233
02:13:30,761 --> 02:13:32,012
I'm fine.

2234
02:13:44,942 --> 02:13:46,193
Sit down.

2235
02:13:52,157 --> 02:13:55,577
- How's Jack?
- He's fine. He's in Russia.

2236
02:13:55,661 --> 02:13:56,787
- Is he?
- Yes.

2237
02:13:56,912 --> 02:13:58,664
He's trying to get recognition
from the Comintern

2238
02:13:58,747 --> 02:14:00,874
for the Communist Labor Party.

2239
02:14:00,999 --> 02:14:03,877
You see, they've split
into two different factions.

2240
02:14:04,127 --> 02:14:07,798
And you?
Left alone with your work again?

2241
02:14:09,633 --> 02:14:10,634
No.

2242
02:14:11,051 --> 02:14:13,428
Well, actually, yes,
but my work is different now.

2243
02:14:13,554 --> 02:14:16,348
I do a lot of lecturing
about what I saw in Russia.

2244
02:14:16,431 --> 02:14:18,016
Ah, yes, Russia.

2245
02:14:19,101 --> 02:14:21,603
Russia's been good for you and Jack.

2246
02:14:21,854 --> 02:14:25,816
Given you a way to meet people,
given him a reason to leave home.

2247
02:14:27,609 --> 02:14:28,777
Russia.

2248
02:14:30,070 --> 02:14:31,196
Russia.

2249
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:33,991
Are you really that cynical,
or are you angry with me?

2250
02:14:34,116 --> 02:14:36,827
I'm really that cynical.
Why would I be angry with you?

2251
02:14:36,952 --> 02:14:38,370
Gene, if you'd been to Russia,

2252
02:14:38,453 --> 02:14:40,497
you'd never be cynical
about anything again.

2253
02:14:40,622 --> 02:14:43,417
You would have seen
people transformed. Ordinary people.

2254
02:14:43,500 --> 02:14:48,088
Louise, something in me tightens when
an American intellectual's eyes shine

2255
02:14:48,422 --> 02:14:51,466
and they start to talk to me
about the Russian people.

2256
02:14:51,633 --> 02:14:53,468
- Wait...
- Something in me says, "Watch it.

2257
02:14:53,594 --> 02:14:57,639
"A new version of Irish Catholicism
is being offered for your faith."

2258
02:14:57,806 --> 02:14:59,349
- It's not like that.
- And I wonder why

2259
02:14:59,474 --> 02:15:04,062
a lovely wife like Louise Reed
who's just seen the brave new world

2260
02:15:04,146 --> 02:15:06,523
is sitting around
with a cynical bastard like me

2261
02:15:06,648 --> 02:15:10,569
instead of trotting all over Russia
with her idealistic husband.

2262
02:15:11,153 --> 02:15:14,781
It's almost worth being converted.

2263
02:15:18,035 --> 02:15:19,953
Well, I was wrong to come.

2264
02:15:20,746 --> 02:15:24,666
You and Jack have a lot of
middle-class dreams for two radicals.

2265
02:15:25,584 --> 02:15:29,004
Jack dreams that he can hustle
the American working man,

2266
02:15:29,087 --> 02:15:31,840
whose one dream is to be rich enough
not to have to work,

2267
02:15:31,965 --> 02:15:34,468
into a revolution led by his party.

2268
02:15:34,635 --> 02:15:37,471
And you dream that if you discuss
the revolution with a man

2269
02:15:37,554 --> 02:15:39,264
before you go to bed with him,

2270
02:15:39,348 --> 02:15:41,683
it'll be missionary work rather than sex.

2271
02:15:42,351 --> 02:15:45,771
I'm sorry to see you and Jack
so serious about your sports.

2272
02:15:45,854 --> 02:15:48,357
It's particularly disappointing
in you, Louise.

2273
02:15:48,440 --> 02:15:52,110
You had a lighter touch
when you were touting free love.

2274
02:15:54,696 --> 02:15:57,491
Boy, you've become quite the critic,
haven't you, Gene?

2275
02:15:57,616 --> 02:16:00,160
Just leaned back and analyzed us all.

2276
02:16:00,494 --> 02:16:03,121
Duplicitous women who tout free love
and then get married,

2277
02:16:03,205 --> 02:16:05,457
power-mad journalists
who join the revolution

2278
02:16:05,541 --> 02:16:06,834
instead of observing it,

2279
02:16:06,917 --> 02:16:09,044
middle-class radicals
who come looking for sex

2280
02:16:09,169 --> 02:16:10,629
and then talk about Russia.

2281
02:16:10,712 --> 02:16:12,881
It must seem so contemptible
to a man like you

2282
02:16:13,006 --> 02:16:15,926
who has the courage to sit on his ass
and observe human inadequacy

2283
02:16:16,051 --> 02:16:17,719
from the inside of a bottle.

2284
02:16:17,845 --> 02:16:20,013
Well, I've never seen you
do anything for anyone.

2285
02:16:20,138 --> 02:16:21,598
I've never seen you
give anything to anyone,

2286
02:16:21,723 --> 02:16:25,102
so I can understand why you might
suspect the motives of those who have.

2287
02:16:25,227 --> 02:16:27,563
But whatever Jack's motives are, how...

2288
02:16:29,231 --> 02:16:31,441
I seem to have touched a wound.

2289
02:16:33,944 --> 02:16:35,362
You're a wounding son of a bitch,

2290
02:16:35,445 --> 02:16:38,782
and whatever I've done to you,
you've made me pay for it.

2291
02:16:40,617 --> 02:16:41,869
Louise.

2292
02:17:11,023 --> 02:17:12,191
Jessie!

2293
02:17:12,774 --> 02:17:15,777
Hey, Jess, come on! Come here, Jess.

2294
02:17:16,153 --> 02:17:17,738
Jessie, come here.

2295
02:17:23,285 --> 02:17:24,411
Jessie.

2296
02:18:01,448 --> 02:18:02,616
Jessie?

2297
02:18:20,551 --> 02:18:21,552
Jessie?

2298
02:18:21,677 --> 02:18:23,136
- Oh!
- Good evening.

2299
02:18:23,262 --> 02:18:25,389
By the order of the Attorney General
of the United States,

2300
02:18:25,514 --> 02:18:27,182
A. Mitchell Palmer,
I have a warrant here

2301
02:18:27,307 --> 02:18:29,017
for the arrest of one John Silas Reed.

2302
02:18:29,142 --> 02:18:30,894
Look upstairs, Frank.

2303
02:18:37,943 --> 02:18:40,070
- Arrest for what?
- Sedition.

2304
02:18:40,821 --> 02:18:42,906
- Where is he?
- What do you mean by sedition?

2305
02:18:43,031 --> 02:18:45,325
Lady, don't ask me.
Ask Woodrow Wilson.

2306
02:18:45,409 --> 02:18:47,160
Just tell me where he is.

2307
02:18:52,624 --> 02:18:53,834
I don't suppose there's a chance

2308
02:18:53,917 --> 02:18:56,378
of you being a Bolshevik agitator,
is there?

2309
02:18:57,212 --> 02:19:00,382
Why don't you just look around,
and see how agitated you get?

2310
02:19:00,841 --> 02:19:02,801
In 1919,

2311
02:19:03,385 --> 02:19:05,429
there were no more

2312
02:19:05,554 --> 02:19:09,057
than four or five Americans

2313
02:19:09,349 --> 02:19:11,226
who got into Russia

2314
02:19:11,393 --> 02:19:16,273
because the country was surrounded
on all sides.

2315
02:19:16,690 --> 02:19:20,569
You were actually forbidden to go,
and you could only go illegally.

2316
02:19:20,777 --> 02:19:23,655
It was very dangerous
to go through Finland.

2317
02:19:23,989 --> 02:19:26,491
Because the Finns
were a White government,

2318
02:19:26,575 --> 02:19:29,536
and they were bitterly opposed
to the Reds.

2319
02:19:29,912 --> 02:19:31,705
They decided to strangle

2320
02:19:31,788 --> 02:19:35,167
the revolutionary Bolshevik infant
in its cradle.

2321
02:19:35,250 --> 02:19:39,379
And 16 armies went into Russia
from the east and from the west,

2322
02:19:39,630 --> 02:19:41,882
for the purpose
of wiping out the Bolsheviks

2323
02:19:42,007 --> 02:19:43,926
and wiping out the revolution

2324
02:19:44,009 --> 02:19:48,347
and restoring Christian civilization
to its rightful place.

2325
02:20:14,122 --> 02:20:15,457
Speak English.

2326
02:20:15,541 --> 02:20:17,751
Have a lemon.
You won't see one for a long time.

2327
02:20:17,876 --> 02:20:21,296
Thank you. I just want to know
if you think that I was clear

2328
02:20:21,421 --> 02:20:23,590
- in what I said about...
- Eminently clear.

2329
02:20:23,715 --> 02:20:24,758
Salt?

2330
02:20:26,468 --> 02:20:28,220
- Salt?
- For the lemon.

2331
02:20:28,804 --> 02:20:30,097
Thank you.

2332
02:20:32,182 --> 02:20:34,768
I see you eat the peel with the lemon.

2333
02:20:35,018 --> 02:20:37,980
Fights the scurvy. So does the onion.

2334
02:20:38,814 --> 02:20:41,108
Together, they fight better.

2335
02:20:43,318 --> 02:20:45,863
You see, what I really wanted to do

2336
02:20:45,988 --> 02:20:48,532
was ask your frank opinion
whether we...

2337
02:20:48,657 --> 02:20:51,743
You think we'll get the endorsement
from the committee.

2338
02:20:51,869 --> 02:20:54,830
- I ask unofficially, of course.
- Unofficially?

2339
02:20:58,125 --> 02:21:00,127
Unofficially, I don't know.

2340
02:21:01,253 --> 02:21:03,589
Yeah, well, it's such a...

2341
02:21:03,839 --> 02:21:07,050
It's a peculiarly American problem
and I...

2342
02:21:07,509 --> 02:21:10,137
- You do think I was clear?
- Quite clear.

2343
02:21:10,429 --> 02:21:14,474
In this case, however, clarity does not
necessarily guarantee endorsement.

2344
02:21:14,683 --> 02:21:17,644
Well, I don't know.
In this case, I think perhaps it might.

2345
02:21:17,769 --> 02:21:21,523
You know, in fact, I don't...

2346
02:21:21,648 --> 02:21:24,526
What I really want to do
is to make a detailed report

2347
02:21:24,651 --> 02:21:27,487
for the Executive Committee to read
on conditions in America.

2348
02:21:27,571 --> 02:21:30,657
You see, I'd like to deal in that report
with the entire history

2349
02:21:30,741 --> 02:21:32,367
of the American Federation of Labor.

2350
02:21:32,492 --> 02:21:34,661
I'd like to deal
with its support of the war, you see.

2351
02:21:34,745 --> 02:21:37,998
And I'm gonna talk
about the persecution of the IWW,

2352
02:21:38,123 --> 02:21:40,667
I'm gonna deal with the rise
of the patrioteering societies,

2353
02:21:40,751 --> 02:21:42,628
and the capitulation
of leading socialists.

2354
02:21:42,711 --> 02:21:45,255
- I'm gonna... Am I speaking too quickly?
- No, no. Go on.

2355
02:21:45,422 --> 02:21:50,135
And so I will deal with
the rising militancy of American labor.

2356
02:21:50,302 --> 02:21:54,014
I'll talk about the general strikes
in Seattle and Winnipeg,

2357
02:21:54,139 --> 02:21:55,516
the Boston police strike.

2358
02:21:55,599 --> 02:21:58,685
I'm gonna discuss the Plumb Plan,
and particularly the attitude

2359
02:21:58,769 --> 02:22:01,522
and the policies of the AF of L
and IWW toward them.

2360
02:22:01,647 --> 02:22:03,649
Now, after that, I think it's important...

2361
02:22:10,989 --> 02:22:13,492
Comrade Reed, the Executive
Committee of the Comintern

2362
02:22:13,659 --> 02:22:16,870
has decided against endorsing
either the Communist Labor Party

2363
02:22:16,995 --> 02:22:18,956
or the Communist Party of America,

2364
02:22:19,081 --> 02:22:22,000
and instructs the two parties
to merge forthwith.

2365
02:22:27,464 --> 02:22:28,715
Sit here, Comrade Reed.

2366
02:22:28,799 --> 02:22:30,759
This time, your usual chair,
as you can see,

2367
02:22:30,884 --> 02:22:33,846
is now occupied by your detailed report
on American conditions.

2368
02:22:33,929 --> 02:22:36,431
A most penetrating study.
Very, very clear.

2369
02:22:36,598 --> 02:22:37,766
Thank you.

2370
02:22:38,308 --> 02:22:40,477
Obviously, it wasn't clear enough.

2371
02:22:41,478 --> 02:22:42,604
Comrade Radek,

2372
02:22:42,729 --> 02:22:45,232
I think there must have been
some mistake

2373
02:22:45,357 --> 02:22:48,443
about my travel arrangements
about my return to the United States.

2374
02:22:49,361 --> 02:22:53,740
Well, it seems as if I've been asked
to report to the Propaganda Bureau.

2375
02:22:53,824 --> 02:22:54,950
That is right.

2376
02:22:55,075 --> 02:22:58,453
Comrade Reed,
the Executive Committee has decided

2377
02:22:58,537 --> 02:23:01,123
you are very much needed
at the Propaganda Bureau.

2378
02:23:01,248 --> 02:23:03,917
We plan for you to remain
in Soviet Russia until July.

2379
02:23:04,001 --> 02:23:06,086
You're very welcome
to the Bureau of Propaganda.

2380
02:23:06,170 --> 02:23:07,462
Well, thank you very much,

2381
02:23:07,588 --> 02:23:10,299
but I thought that these
travel arrangements had been made.

2382
02:23:10,424 --> 02:23:12,718
I have to get to the Latvian
or the Finnish border.

2383
02:23:12,801 --> 02:23:14,970
And to which border would you suggest,
Comrade Reed?

2384
02:23:15,095 --> 02:23:17,598
Well, I understand that train travel
is very dangerous at the moment...

2385
02:23:17,681 --> 02:23:19,266
Why does he need a train?

2386
02:23:20,350 --> 02:23:23,645
Because I have urgent personal
considerations and responsibilities

2387
02:23:23,770 --> 02:23:25,939
- in the United States and I...
- Of what nature?

2388
02:23:26,815 --> 02:23:28,775
- Excuse me?
- Of what nature?

2389
02:23:33,030 --> 02:23:35,657
- I have a family.
- We all have families.

2390
02:23:37,159 --> 02:23:41,580
Well, I can speak only for myself
and I must see my wife.

2391
02:23:41,663 --> 02:23:43,123
It's very urgent,

2392
02:23:44,333 --> 02:23:48,253
and I ask only
for a single place on a train.

2393
02:23:48,337 --> 02:23:49,713
But you have a place on the train!

2394
02:23:49,838 --> 02:23:51,840
You have a place
on the train of this revolution.

2395
02:23:51,965 --> 02:23:54,301
You have been like so many others,
the best revolutionaries.

2396
02:23:54,384 --> 02:23:56,720
One of the engineers
on the locomotive of this train

2397
02:23:56,845 --> 02:24:00,682
that pulls this revolution
on the tracks of historical necessity

2398
02:24:00,766 --> 02:24:02,351
laid out for it by the party.

2399
02:24:02,476 --> 02:24:04,311
You can't leave us now.
We can't replace you.

2400
02:24:04,394 --> 02:24:06,104
- What right do you have you to leave...
- I'm not sure.

2401
02:24:06,188 --> 02:24:08,232
To do what? To see your wife?

2402
02:24:08,357 --> 02:24:09,983
Last year at the International Congress

2403
02:24:10,067 --> 02:24:11,693
I learned that my son
was very ill of typhus.

2404
02:24:11,818 --> 02:24:13,320
I didn't go to see my son

2405
02:24:13,445 --> 02:24:16,532
because I knew I was needed
where I was placed by the party.

2406
02:24:16,657 --> 02:24:17,616
What you don't understand is...

2407
02:24:17,741 --> 02:24:20,244
Would you like to abandon this moment
in your life?

2408
02:24:20,369 --> 02:24:21,703
Would you ever get this moment again?

2409
02:24:21,828 --> 02:24:24,915
- I am not abandoning the revolution!
- Comrade Reed, you're a writer.

2410
02:24:25,040 --> 02:24:26,500
People know and respect your work.

2411
02:24:26,583 --> 02:24:29,837
- You speak with authority of feeling.
- Comrade Zinoviev,

2412
02:24:29,920 --> 02:24:31,296
for the past eight weeks,

2413
02:24:31,380 --> 02:24:34,383
I've been completely unable
to communicate with my wife

2414
02:24:34,508 --> 02:24:37,010
or with my comrades
in the United States.

2415
02:24:37,094 --> 02:24:38,846
I need to go back. I would like your help.

2416
02:24:38,971 --> 02:24:42,724
Comrade Reed, you can always go back
to your private responsibilities,

2417
02:24:42,850 --> 02:24:43,809
so can I.

2418
02:24:43,934 --> 02:24:48,689
You can never, never come back
to this moment in history.

2419
02:24:49,439 --> 02:24:50,399
I'm sorry.

2420
02:24:50,524 --> 02:24:52,651
I have no right to tell you
about your own life.

2421
02:24:52,734 --> 02:24:54,778
You know it better than I do.

2422
02:25:17,551 --> 02:25:19,720
Maybe it was impossible
to get out of Russia.

2423
02:25:19,845 --> 02:25:22,139
There was White armies all around,

2424
02:25:22,264 --> 02:25:24,933
so escape was not dreamt of.

2425
02:26:21,573 --> 02:26:24,409
We had a communication from Jack.

2426
02:26:24,493 --> 02:26:28,038
He was in prison in Finland
where he couldn't communicate freely.

2427
02:26:28,163 --> 02:26:30,541
But he got word out to me

2428
02:26:30,916 --> 02:26:33,377
to take a message to Louise.

2429
02:26:33,502 --> 02:26:36,505
And I remember walking over to Louise,
she lived right near me.

2430
02:26:36,797 --> 02:26:39,967
I walked over to Louise's apartment
on Patson Place,

2431
02:26:40,342 --> 02:26:43,303
and spent an evening with her
talking about Jack,

2432
02:26:43,387 --> 02:26:47,474
and she talked very earnestly
about Jack's plight.

2433
02:26:59,361 --> 02:27:01,780
Mrs. Reed, the United States
cannot involve itself

2434
02:27:01,864 --> 02:27:03,323
in the internal affairs of Finland.

2435
02:27:03,407 --> 02:27:05,158
Are you trying to tell me
the American Consul

2436
02:27:05,242 --> 02:27:07,828
- can't give you any information?
- I'm afraid that there's nothing

2437
02:27:07,953 --> 02:27:10,372
- that the State Department can do.
- Don't give me that garbage.

2438
02:27:10,497 --> 02:27:12,875
If his name were Rockefeller,
there'd be something you could do.

2439
02:27:12,958 --> 02:27:15,377
Mrs. Reed, if your husband's name
were Rockefeller,

2440
02:27:15,460 --> 02:27:17,212
I think he would hardly be
under indictment

2441
02:27:17,337 --> 02:27:19,840
for a conspiracy to overthrow
the United States Government.

2442
02:27:19,965 --> 02:27:22,801
He has only one kidney.
He could be dangerously ill.

2443
02:27:22,885 --> 02:27:25,429
That is a chance
that your husband took, Mrs. Reed,

2444
02:27:25,554 --> 02:27:29,725
when he left the United States
without an exit visa or a passport.

2445
02:27:29,850 --> 02:27:31,852
Good day, Mrs. Reed.

2446
02:27:32,811 --> 02:27:35,480
The United States
participated with the Allies

2447
02:27:35,564 --> 02:27:38,567
in military expeditions against
the Soviet Union

2448
02:27:38,692 --> 02:27:42,070
in an attempt to overcome them,
invade them,

2449
02:27:42,988 --> 02:27:45,574
and set up another government.
Oh, yes. Yes.

2450
02:27:45,699 --> 02:27:47,242
There was a noose

2451
02:27:47,701 --> 02:27:50,954
to be pulled around Russia

2452
02:27:51,079 --> 02:27:56,043
which gave you an idea
of how a whole country

2453
02:27:56,126 --> 02:28:00,631
can be surrounded
east, west, south, and north.

2454
02:28:09,306 --> 02:28:11,934
Your name,
and the name of your contact in Finland.

2455
02:28:29,910 --> 02:28:32,579
Your name,
and the name of your contact in Finland.

2456
02:28:32,955 --> 02:28:34,289
I don't know what color...

2457
02:28:35,249 --> 02:28:36,583
I'll just get it myself.

2458
02:28:36,667 --> 02:28:39,127
- Would you get some...
- Would you like us to do it now?

2459
02:28:39,253 --> 02:28:40,629
- Okay.
- Oh, okay.

2460
02:28:40,838 --> 02:28:41,797
- All right.
- I understand.

2461
02:28:42,422 --> 02:28:43,382
From the top?

2462
02:28:44,216 --> 02:28:46,468
Oh, I see. Then they made a map.

2463
02:28:47,928 --> 02:28:49,096
Terry spoke to me.

2464
02:28:49,179 --> 02:28:52,391
Louise, I don't think you realize
how difficult this trip to be for a woman.

2465
02:28:52,474 --> 02:28:53,517
You'd have to stow away.

2466
02:28:53,684 --> 02:28:56,270
If you got there at all,
it would take you six months to...

2467
02:28:56,395 --> 02:28:58,647
Terry said that he thought that
you could arrange a freighter for me

2468
02:28:58,772 --> 02:29:00,440
- as far as Norway.
- Don't know why you're saying it.

2469
02:29:00,524 --> 02:29:02,234
You know what I mean?

2470
02:29:02,651 --> 02:29:03,861
Sit down.

2471
02:29:05,821 --> 02:29:08,365
I want to talk to you about something.

2472
02:29:09,700 --> 02:29:10,659
...indicates the map.

2473
02:29:10,826 --> 02:29:12,327
I could go.

2474
02:29:12,452 --> 02:29:15,831
I can sign on as a seaman.
There'd be no questions asked.

2475
02:29:15,914 --> 02:29:17,958
I think under the circumstances...

2476
02:29:21,670 --> 02:29:24,965
Don't look at me like that.
Jack Reed's a friend of mine.

2477
02:29:25,090 --> 02:29:27,885
I'm not gonna let
the son of a bitch rot in jail.

2478
02:29:28,010 --> 02:29:29,803
Just seemed to me
that I'm not as interested...

2479
02:29:34,725 --> 02:29:36,518
...and at this point...

2480
02:29:37,436 --> 02:29:38,729
Okay.

2481
02:29:38,854 --> 02:29:41,190
Wasn't he supposed to come over
to me on this?

2482
02:29:41,315 --> 02:29:43,692
I'll talk to Terry in the morning.

2483
02:29:43,775 --> 02:29:45,903
Where the cross is made...

2484
02:29:46,028 --> 02:29:48,280
I wish these son-of-a-bitches could act.

2485
02:30:34,034 --> 02:30:36,370
Your blood pressure is very high.

2486
02:30:36,995 --> 02:30:39,748
They only give me
some kind of salted fish.

2487
02:30:39,873 --> 02:30:42,876
The blood in your mouth
is from the gums.

2488
02:30:43,001 --> 02:30:44,545
You have scurvy.

2489
02:30:46,338 --> 02:30:48,841
An impressive shade of red, comrade.

2490
02:30:55,013 --> 02:30:56,723
Could you send a cable to my wife?

2491
02:31:57,743 --> 02:32:00,787
Mr. Reed, I have something for you.

2492
02:32:04,583 --> 02:32:07,294
- Is there a cable?
- There's nothing yet.

2493
02:32:07,878 --> 02:32:11,882
You should take one of these powders
in a glass of water, once a day.

2494
02:32:13,008 --> 02:32:14,927
Has she sent word to me here?

2495
02:32:15,010 --> 02:32:18,138
They won't say.
Our people can find out nothing.

2496
02:32:43,956 --> 02:32:45,582
You are being released.

2497
02:32:49,586 --> 02:32:54,508
You know, I must tell you,
I lost sight of John Reed completely.

2498
02:32:55,175 --> 02:32:57,010
But what I heard was

2499
02:32:57,094 --> 02:33:01,557
the Bolsheviki traded
some Finnish professors

2500
02:33:01,640 --> 02:33:04,101
for the release of John Reed.

2501
02:33:04,226 --> 02:33:05,519
John Reed.

2502
02:33:05,894 --> 02:33:08,021
We are here to welcome you.

2503
02:33:09,982 --> 02:33:12,401
Could you take me
to the telegraph office?

2504
02:33:12,484 --> 02:33:14,528
- Yes. Get in.
- Thank you.

2505
02:33:23,370 --> 02:33:27,374
"Louise Bryant, Croton-on..."

2506
02:33:27,499 --> 02:33:28,959
Hudson.

2507
02:33:29,084 --> 02:33:31,920
"...Hudson, New York, USA.

2508
02:33:32,087 --> 02:33:33,213
"I'm safe. Stop."

2509
02:33:33,505 --> 02:33:35,382
"Please contact..."

2510
02:33:35,883 --> 02:33:37,843
Contact. Please contact.

2511
02:33:37,968 --> 02:33:40,929
"Contact Petrograd telegraph office.
Stop.

2512
02:33:41,013 --> 02:33:43,473
"Have received no word from you. Stop.

2513
02:33:43,849 --> 02:33:47,102
"Please for... Forgive..."

2514
02:33:47,227 --> 02:33:48,937
Please forgive Christmas.

2515
02:33:49,062 --> 02:33:53,692
"Please forgive Christmas. Stop.
Love, Jack."

2516
02:33:56,236 --> 02:33:57,487
Could you send that right away?

2517
02:34:01,825 --> 02:34:04,328
Comrade Lenin said

2518
02:34:04,453 --> 02:34:08,582
he would trade,
for John Reed, fifty professors.

2519
02:34:10,292 --> 02:34:13,504
"Louise Bryant, Croton-on-Hudson,

2520
02:34:13,629 --> 02:34:15,214
"New York, USA."

2521
02:34:15,297 --> 02:34:18,425
- USA.
- "USA. Immediate."

2522
02:34:18,509 --> 02:34:20,928
- Immediate return...
- "Immediate return..."

2523
02:34:21,011 --> 02:34:22,804
- ... United States...
- "...United States..."

2524
02:34:22,930 --> 02:34:24,097
- ... impossible.
- "...impossible."

2525
02:34:24,181 --> 02:34:26,850
- Louise Bryant, Croton...
- Croton.

2526
02:34:26,975 --> 02:34:29,520
- "Croton-on..."
- Croton-on-Hudson.

2527
02:34:29,645 --> 02:34:33,440
"Croton-on-Hudson, New York, USA.

2528
02:34:33,565 --> 02:34:38,529
"Still no word from you. Stop.
Have no fixed address. Stop."

2529
02:34:39,238 --> 02:34:44,201
"Louise Bryant.
Croton-on-Hudson, New York, USA.

2530
02:34:45,911 --> 02:34:49,164
"Must know, are you well? Stop."

2531
02:34:49,289 --> 02:34:51,625
- "Do not..."
- Do not understand.

2532
02:34:51,708 --> 02:34:56,672
"Do not understand
why no word from you. Stop."

2533
02:34:57,840 --> 02:35:02,761
"Louise Bryant.
Croton-on-Hudson, New York, USA.

2534
02:35:02,845 --> 02:35:04,346
- "Need..."
- Need word.

2535
02:35:04,429 --> 02:35:09,351
"Need word from you. Stop.
Do not understand your silence. Stop"

2536
02:35:09,434 --> 02:35:12,813
"Louise Bryant. Croton-on-Hudson,

2537
02:35:12,896 --> 02:35:17,150
- "New York, USA."
- Did you check R-E-A-D?

2538
02:35:17,276 --> 02:35:18,569
Yes. Yes.

2539
02:35:18,694 --> 02:35:19,820
And you checked R-E-l-D also?

2540
02:35:19,945 --> 02:35:22,656
I have looked R-E-l-D,

2541
02:35:22,781 --> 02:35:24,616
R-E-A-D,

2542
02:35:24,700 --> 02:35:28,787
R-E-D.
I have looked Goldman and Bryant.

2543
02:35:30,038 --> 02:35:31,748
I'm just... Excuse me. One second.

2544
02:35:33,041 --> 02:35:34,585
Lf, if...

2545
02:35:34,710 --> 02:35:38,005
I thought maybe there's some other way
of misspelling the name.

2546
02:35:38,130 --> 02:35:41,717
- You also looked under R-E-l-D?
- Yes, Comrade Reed.

2547
02:35:41,842 --> 02:35:46,180
- Yes, yes. What do you want?
- There's many people wait.

2548
02:35:46,263 --> 02:35:49,349
- Excuse me.
- Lf something come, we'll notify you.

2549
02:35:54,730 --> 02:35:56,356
What have you heard?

2550
02:35:56,481 --> 02:35:58,317
Not much. What have you heard?

2551
02:35:58,400 --> 02:36:01,361
I don't hear. I wait.
They've jailed more anarchists.

2552
02:36:01,445 --> 02:36:04,323
But they made Bill Shatoff
head of the Siberian railway.

2553
02:36:04,948 --> 02:36:08,118
They treated me very well,
and I'm reserving my judgment.

2554
02:36:08,243 --> 02:36:11,663
- Well, that's wise.
- There's so much I don't understand.

2555
02:36:11,788 --> 02:36:13,373
There are forests within easy reach
of Petrograd.

2556
02:36:13,498 --> 02:36:15,083
Why is this city freezing?

2557
02:36:15,209 --> 02:36:16,585
I asked Zinoviev.

2558
02:36:16,710 --> 02:36:19,171
He said our enemies have destroyed
all the means of transportation

2559
02:36:19,296 --> 02:36:20,881
and killed off our horses
as well as our men.

2560
02:36:21,006 --> 02:36:22,007
How would we get at it?

2561
02:36:22,090 --> 02:36:23,592
I said, "What about
the people of Petrograd?

2562
02:36:23,675 --> 02:36:26,303
"They could go there together on foot
and haul the wood back with ropes."

2563
02:36:26,428 --> 02:36:27,930
He said, "Oh, yes, it would make
the people warmer,

2564
02:36:28,055 --> 02:36:30,724
"but it would interfere with the carrying
out of the main political policy."

2565
02:36:30,849 --> 02:36:33,560
- You get letters from America, E. G?
- Oh, yes.

2566
02:36:33,685 --> 02:36:37,314
All opened by the Justice Department.
I hope they enjoy what they read. I don't.

2567
02:36:37,439 --> 02:36:39,775
So I asked him,
"What are the main political policies?"

2568
02:36:39,900 --> 02:36:42,569
He said,
"Concentration of all power in the hands

2569
02:36:42,653 --> 02:36:44,196
"of the proletarian avant-garde.

2570
02:36:44,279 --> 02:36:48,325
"The avant-garde of the revolution,
which is the Communist Party."

2571
02:36:48,784 --> 02:36:51,328
Anybody mention Louise?

2572
02:36:51,453 --> 02:36:54,331
I don't think so.
You haven't heard from her?

2573
02:36:54,831 --> 02:36:57,709
I've sent her cables,
but I don't get any answer.

2574
02:36:57,793 --> 02:37:00,295
- For how long?
- A long time.

2575
02:37:01,296 --> 02:37:02,464
Wait.

2576
02:37:02,589 --> 02:37:05,425
Rhys Williams
mentioned her in his letter.

2577
02:37:05,509 --> 02:37:07,845
He hasn't heard from her, either.

2578
02:37:07,970 --> 02:37:09,096
What'd he say?

2579
02:37:10,472 --> 02:37:13,725
I think he said
that he'd tried to reach her

2580
02:37:13,809 --> 02:37:16,937
sometime after Christmas,
but she'd left New York.

2581
02:37:20,649 --> 02:37:22,734
How long ago was that?

2582
02:37:22,818 --> 02:37:25,279
Well, you know how these letters take
a couple of months to get here.

2583
02:37:25,362 --> 02:37:30,200
By the time I get them, whoever sent it
is either in jail or deported.

2584
02:37:30,325 --> 02:37:31,994
- That's it.
- Which?

2585
02:37:32,119 --> 02:37:33,495
- There.
- Rhys Williams.

2586
02:37:33,954 --> 02:37:34,913
Oh.

2587
02:37:36,331 --> 02:37:39,001
- First the eyes go, then the legs.
- Yeah.

2588
02:37:39,751 --> 02:37:42,462
Yeah, I don't understand
the fuel situation, either.

2589
02:37:44,089 --> 02:37:46,133
I don't know...

2590
02:37:50,179 --> 02:37:52,681
He says she seems to be out of town.

2591
02:37:52,764 --> 02:37:54,099
That's all he said?

2592
02:37:55,559 --> 02:37:56,643
Yeah.

2593
02:37:57,227 --> 02:37:59,271
What did he say about O'Neill?

2594
02:37:59,354 --> 02:38:00,981
O'Neill? Nothing.

2595
02:38:01,481 --> 02:38:03,192
Come on, what did he say?

2596
02:38:04,401 --> 02:38:05,694
Nothing.

2597
02:38:05,819 --> 02:38:07,237
Can I see it?

2598
02:38:13,410 --> 02:38:14,703
I'm sorry.

2599
02:38:22,961 --> 02:38:25,130
I just don't know where...

2600
02:38:28,884 --> 02:38:31,053
Jack, sit down.

2601
02:38:42,731 --> 02:38:44,566
If Louise were to come here,

2602
02:38:44,691 --> 02:38:47,110
she'd have to leave
the United States illegally,

2603
02:38:47,236 --> 02:38:49,488
then live in exile with you,
and never go home again.

2604
02:38:50,531 --> 02:38:53,825
All for the sake of a revolution
she was never any part of.

2605
02:38:53,909 --> 02:38:55,702
Why should she?

2606
02:38:56,370 --> 02:38:58,830
You chose the life of a revolutionary.

2607
02:38:58,914 --> 02:39:00,249
She didn't.

2608
02:39:01,124 --> 02:39:05,712
Your cables only focus the
Justice Department's attention on her,

2609
02:39:05,838 --> 02:39:08,382
and the most seditious thing
they can accuse her of

2610
02:39:08,507 --> 02:39:10,217
is being your wife.

2611
02:39:11,218 --> 02:39:13,345
Leave her alone.

2612
02:39:13,428 --> 02:39:15,222
Let her choose her own future.

2613
02:39:16,431 --> 02:39:18,559
Why hasn't she answered me?

2614
02:39:18,642 --> 02:39:20,477
I think she has answered you.

2615
02:41:36,822 --> 02:41:40,033
He's been released.
They won't tell me where he is.

2616
02:42:02,306 --> 02:42:05,601
Do you know, she was much hated

2617
02:42:05,726 --> 02:42:07,853
for her extravagance in clothes.

2618
02:42:07,936 --> 02:42:12,316
Well, a long time ago,
somebody said to me,

2619
02:42:13,775 --> 02:42:14,776
"People who...

2620
02:42:14,902 --> 02:42:17,779
"Women whose lives
have been in danger

2621
02:42:18,155 --> 02:42:21,617
"over a long period
are always the most extravagant."

2622
02:42:22,117 --> 02:42:24,870
Comrades, as wrong-headed
as many of its policies are,

2623
02:42:24,953 --> 02:42:27,372
the IWW is a revolutionary union

2624
02:42:27,456 --> 02:42:29,499
and the American Federation of Labor
is not.

2625
02:42:29,625 --> 02:42:32,628
To think we can infiltrate
the American Federation of Labor

2626
02:42:32,753 --> 02:42:34,963
and convert it
to revolutionary policies is hopeless.

2627
02:42:35,088 --> 02:42:36,215
Translation.

2628
02:42:39,134 --> 02:42:41,720
Comrades, that's the wrong translation.

2629
02:42:49,436 --> 02:42:51,188
That's not what he said.

2630
02:42:51,813 --> 02:42:52,940
What's he saying?

2631
02:42:53,482 --> 02:42:55,526
For us to make a point
on the floor of the Congress,

2632
02:42:55,651 --> 02:42:57,194
we have to go

2633
02:42:57,319 --> 02:43:00,030
from our own English language
into the official German language

2634
02:43:00,155 --> 02:43:02,741
to the Italian, or Spanish,
or French language.

2635
02:43:02,824 --> 02:43:06,620
- And then, when the response from...
- What is your question, please?

2636
02:43:06,703 --> 02:43:09,122
Simply for the labor union issue,

2637
02:43:09,206 --> 02:43:11,667
could we have the English language
as an official language

2638
02:43:11,750 --> 02:43:13,669
on the floor of the Congress?

2639
02:43:16,129 --> 02:43:19,299
Comrade Reed, this is the third time
you have raised this proposal!

2640
02:43:19,383 --> 02:43:20,551
The issue has been decided.

2641
02:43:20,676 --> 02:43:22,970
We must move on
to the national and colonial issues!

2642
02:43:27,683 --> 02:43:30,394
Real revolutionary workers
in the United States

2643
02:43:30,519 --> 02:43:33,647
quit the AF of L a long time ago

2644
02:43:33,730 --> 02:43:35,774
and joined the IWW.

2645
02:43:35,858 --> 02:43:38,110
We have to make
the Russians understand this,

2646
02:43:38,193 --> 02:43:40,946
and that's why we want your support

2647
02:43:41,029 --> 02:43:45,909
to extend the session of congress
and to keep the debate open.

2648
02:43:57,087 --> 02:43:58,547
Jack, are you okay?

2649
02:43:58,630 --> 02:44:00,382
- Did you talk to Sadoul?
- Yes, I did.

2650
02:44:00,507 --> 02:44:03,844
Comrades, I'm still opposed to closing
the discussion here.

2651
02:44:03,927 --> 02:44:06,388
I think that this discussion
is being closed

2652
02:44:06,471 --> 02:44:09,683
to avoid hearing the American
and the British delegations.

2653
02:44:09,808 --> 02:44:12,060
And if for no other reason than that,

2654
02:44:12,186 --> 02:44:14,146
it shows that discussion
should continue.

2655
02:44:14,229 --> 02:44:16,523
Comrade Radek
uses this sort of remark

2656
02:44:16,607 --> 02:44:19,610
in place of an argument and as a result,
he doesn't want to talk about it.

2657
02:44:19,735 --> 02:44:24,364
What Reed says is not distinguished
by excessive fear of distorting the truth.

2658
02:44:24,448 --> 02:44:26,867
He goes on day and night
and has the cheek to claim

2659
02:44:26,950 --> 02:44:28,702
that the discussion is being broken off

2660
02:44:28,785 --> 02:44:31,246
because of fear of the great might
of John Reed.

2661
02:44:48,096 --> 02:44:51,141
Comrade Reed, you may have time
to discuss it until tomorrow morning.

2662
02:44:51,266 --> 02:44:52,601
Other people do not have the time.

2663
02:44:52,726 --> 02:44:56,396
Comrade Radek, other people that
don't have the time for this discussion

2664
02:44:56,522 --> 02:44:59,608
are 101 leaders of the IWW

2665
02:44:59,733 --> 02:45:01,568
who are in jail today
in the United States

2666
02:45:01,693 --> 02:45:03,487
because of their revolutionary views.

2667
02:45:03,612 --> 02:45:06,532
And if we turn our back
on these comrades

2668
02:45:06,615 --> 02:45:10,327
out of some pipe dream to radicalize
the American Federation of Labor

2669
02:45:10,452 --> 02:45:11,578
which cannot be done, it is a disgrace.

2670
02:45:11,703 --> 02:45:14,289
We've discussed this
during six sessions of this commission.

2671
02:45:14,414 --> 02:45:16,041
We spent whole day today discussing it,

2672
02:45:16,124 --> 02:45:18,335
and you insinuate
we are trying to dismiss the issue?

2673
02:45:24,049 --> 02:45:25,801
We haven't had enough discussion...

2674
02:45:25,926 --> 02:45:28,303
We haven't had enough discussion
for my friend here

2675
02:45:28,428 --> 02:45:31,932
to realize that Louis Fraina and I
think alike on this problem.

2676
02:45:32,057 --> 02:45:33,767
Every American on our delegation,

2677
02:45:33,851 --> 02:45:36,436
- every man on the English delegation...
- You are a member of this committee.

2678
02:45:36,562 --> 02:45:38,063
You are not
an independent political party.

2679
02:45:38,188 --> 02:45:41,483
Comrade Zinoviev, I will not be
steamrollered by this committee

2680
02:45:41,608 --> 02:45:44,444
that has not had
a proper education on this problem.

2681
02:45:44,528 --> 02:45:46,071
On the fact...

2682
02:45:53,912 --> 02:45:55,247
The discussion is closed.

2683
02:45:55,330 --> 02:45:58,041
However, if Comrade Reed
wishes to make a statement,

2684
02:45:58,166 --> 02:46:00,460
he will have two minutes to do so.

2685
02:46:01,086 --> 02:46:04,548
I would merely want to say that
on behalf of the American delegates,

2686
02:46:04,673 --> 02:46:07,050
that we will refuse
to vote on these theses,

2687
02:46:07,176 --> 02:46:10,804
and that I myself
will resign my seat on this committee.

2688
02:47:16,370 --> 02:47:18,288
Jack, I think we have to face it.

2689
02:47:18,413 --> 02:47:21,500
The dream that we had
is dying in Russia.

2690
02:47:21,583 --> 02:47:24,086
If Bolshevism means
the peasants taking the land,

2691
02:47:24,169 --> 02:47:25,587
the workers taking the factories,

2692
02:47:25,712 --> 02:47:29,049
Russia's one place
where there's no Bolshevism.

2693
02:47:29,174 --> 02:47:32,719
You know, I can argue with cops,
I can fight with generals.

2694
02:47:32,803 --> 02:47:34,763
I can't deal with a bureaucrat.

2695
02:47:34,888 --> 02:47:37,516
You think Zinoviev is nothing worse
than a bureaucrat?

2696
02:47:38,016 --> 02:47:40,060
The Soviets have no more
local autonomy.

2697
02:47:40,185 --> 02:47:41,854
The central state has all the power.

2698
02:47:41,937 --> 02:47:43,689
All the power
is in the hands of a few men

2699
02:47:43,772 --> 02:47:45,440
and they are destroying the revolution.

2700
02:47:45,566 --> 02:47:48,819
They are destroying any hope
of real Communism in Russia.

2701
02:47:48,944 --> 02:47:51,488
They're putting people like me in jail.

2702
02:47:51,613 --> 02:47:53,657
My understanding of revolution

2703
02:47:53,782 --> 02:47:56,869
is not a continual extermination
of political dissenters,

2704
02:47:56,952 --> 02:47:58,954
and I want no part of it.

2705
02:47:59,621 --> 02:48:01,790
Every single newspaper's
been shut down

2706
02:48:01,915 --> 02:48:03,250
or taken over by the party.

2707
02:48:03,375 --> 02:48:06,420
Anyone even vaguely suspected
of being a counter-revolutionary

2708
02:48:06,503 --> 02:48:09,965
can be taken out and shot
without a trial. Where does that end?

2709
02:48:10,090 --> 02:48:12,426
Is any nightmare justifiable

2710
02:48:12,509 --> 02:48:15,387
in the name of defense
against counter-revolution?

2711
02:48:15,470 --> 02:48:17,431
The dream may be dying in Russia,
but I'm not.

2712
02:48:17,514 --> 02:48:20,100
It may take some time. I'm getting out.

2713
02:48:20,225 --> 02:48:23,020
You sound like you're a little confused
by the revolution in action, E.G.

2714
02:48:23,145 --> 02:48:25,439
Up to now,
you've only dealt with it in theory.

2715
02:48:25,522 --> 02:48:26,773
What did you think
this thing was gonna be?

2716
02:48:26,899 --> 02:48:28,358
A revolution by consensus

2717
02:48:28,483 --> 02:48:30,903
where we all sat down
and agreed over a cup of coffee?

2718
02:48:30,986 --> 02:48:33,155
Nothing works.

2719
02:48:33,280 --> 02:48:35,282
Four million people died last year.

2720
02:48:35,407 --> 02:48:36,575
Not from fighting a war,

2721
02:48:36,658 --> 02:48:39,536
they died from starvation and typhus
in a militaristic police state

2722
02:48:39,661 --> 02:48:41,163
that suppresses
freedom and human rights

2723
02:48:41,288 --> 02:48:42,414
where nothing works.

2724
02:48:42,497 --> 02:48:45,042
They died because of a
French, British and American blockade

2725
02:48:45,167 --> 02:48:47,503
that cut off
all food and medical supplies

2726
02:48:47,628 --> 02:48:49,713
and because counter-revolutionaries
have sabotaged the factories

2727
02:48:49,838 --> 02:48:52,799
and the railroads and the telephones,
and because the people,

2728
02:48:52,883 --> 02:48:55,594
the poor, ignorant,
superstitious, illiterate people,

2729
02:48:55,677 --> 02:48:58,972
are trying to run things themselves,
just as you always said that they should,

2730
02:48:59,056 --> 02:49:00,140
but they don't know
how to run them yet.

2731
02:49:00,265 --> 02:49:02,351
Did you really think things would work
right away?

2732
02:49:02,518 --> 02:49:04,561
Did you really expect
social transformation

2733
02:49:04,686 --> 02:49:06,813
to be anything other than
a murderous process?

2734
02:49:06,939 --> 02:49:09,858
It's a war, E.G.,
and we gotta fight it like we fight a war,

2735
02:49:09,983 --> 02:49:12,027
with discipline,
with terror, with firing squads,

2736
02:49:12,152 --> 02:49:14,112
or we just give it up.

2737
02:49:14,238 --> 02:49:16,615
Those four million people
didn't die fighting a war.

2738
02:49:16,698 --> 02:49:19,409
They died from a system
that cannot work!

2739
02:49:28,460 --> 02:49:30,420
It's just the beginning, E.G.

2740
02:49:31,213 --> 02:49:33,841
It's not happening
the way we thought it would.

2741
02:49:33,966 --> 02:49:35,676
It's not happening
the way we wanted it to,

2742
02:49:35,759 --> 02:49:37,219
but it's happening.

2743
02:49:41,849 --> 02:49:43,767
If you walk out on it now,

2744
02:49:44,184 --> 02:49:46,353
what's your whole life meant?

2745
02:49:50,899 --> 02:49:53,694
Could you tell me if my resignation
is ready for signature yet?

2746
02:49:53,777 --> 02:49:55,028
- It is.
- Good.

2747
02:49:55,112 --> 02:49:56,697
May I see it?

2748
02:49:57,865 --> 02:49:59,157
Thank you.

2749
02:50:05,581 --> 02:50:08,208
- Thank you, Comrade Reed.
- Welcome back, Comrade Reed.

2750
02:50:08,292 --> 02:50:10,711
Now you'll be able to represent
the American workers

2751
02:50:10,794 --> 02:50:12,171
at the forthcoming congress at Baku

2752
02:50:12,254 --> 02:50:15,841
to inspire revolution among the peoples
of the Middle East.

2753
02:50:15,924 --> 02:50:16,925
Prepare for a difficult trip.

2754
02:50:17,050 --> 02:50:19,052
Our only route
is through divided territory.

2755
02:50:59,927 --> 02:51:03,514
Some of these intellectuals
spread rumors

2756
02:51:03,639 --> 02:51:06,308
that he changed his mind afterwards,

2757
02:51:06,433 --> 02:51:08,268
trying to, you know,

2758
02:51:11,522 --> 02:51:14,650
show that he came to his senses.

2759
02:51:15,984 --> 02:51:18,278
It's preposterous.

2760
02:51:18,654 --> 02:51:22,699
These men, well,
I don't even remember them.

2761
02:51:23,116 --> 02:51:25,327
I don't want to remember them.

2762
02:54:22,337 --> 02:54:25,132
All trains to Baku canceled
because of attacks

2763
02:54:25,257 --> 02:54:26,508
by counter-revolutionaries.

2764
02:54:26,633 --> 02:54:27,885
There must be some train to Baku.

2765
02:54:29,970 --> 02:54:31,430
All trains to Baku canceled

2766
02:54:31,555 --> 02:54:33,891
because of attacks
by counter-revolutionaries.

2767
02:54:34,892 --> 02:54:37,769
There has to be something to Baku.

2768
02:54:39,563 --> 02:54:40,814
Louise?

2769
02:54:44,443 --> 02:54:45,611
Emma?

2770
02:54:46,028 --> 02:54:47,112
Emma.

2771
02:54:48,197 --> 02:54:49,281
Emma.

2772
02:54:51,533 --> 02:54:54,870
How in the name of God
did you get into Russia?

2773
02:54:56,997 --> 02:54:59,833
- I had no idea how long it would take.
- So, you'll wait for a while.

2774
02:55:01,001 --> 02:55:04,421
By the time you got there,
he'd be back here anyway.

2775
02:55:04,546 --> 02:55:06,006
Go on in. Go on in.

2776
02:55:06,089 --> 02:55:07,758
Oh, I'm sorry.

2777
02:55:07,883 --> 02:55:10,427
It's all right. It's all right.

2778
02:55:15,390 --> 02:55:18,602
Here. Louise, sit down. Sit down.

2779
02:55:28,570 --> 02:55:30,781
I want to tell you something.

2780
02:55:32,824 --> 02:55:34,451
It's late, I know.

2781
02:55:39,081 --> 02:55:40,958
I want to thank you for that scarf.

2782
02:55:42,084 --> 02:55:43,335
Oh, yes.

2783
02:55:44,586 --> 02:55:46,380
I was wrong about you.

2784
02:55:47,214 --> 02:55:48,423
So was I.

2785
02:55:50,926 --> 02:55:53,470
The American oil companies
are trying to establish

2786
02:55:53,595 --> 02:55:55,180
a world monopoly of oil.

2787
02:55:57,933 --> 02:56:02,813
In 1898, the Filipinos rebelled against
the cruel colonial government of Spain.

2788
02:56:06,191 --> 02:56:08,694
But after the Spaniards
had been driven out...

2789
02:56:27,254 --> 02:56:30,591
The Americans have promised
the Filipinos independence.

2790
02:56:30,716 --> 02:56:34,428
Soon an independent Filipino republic
will be proclaimed.

2791
02:56:38,807 --> 02:56:42,311
The government of United States
sent soldiers and sailors there...

2792
02:56:45,314 --> 02:56:49,193
...under a dictatorship
worse than the British tyrants.

2793
02:56:57,701 --> 02:56:59,119
What's that for?

2794
02:56:59,203 --> 02:57:01,705
They are supporting you
for your call for a holy war

2795
02:57:01,830 --> 02:57:04,583
of Islamic people against
the western infidels.

2796
02:57:25,729 --> 02:57:27,189
Excuse me, Comrade Reed.

2797
02:57:27,356 --> 02:57:30,025
They said you are not happy
with the translations of your speech.

2798
02:57:30,150 --> 02:57:31,568
I did the German into Turkic

2799
02:57:31,693 --> 02:57:33,904
and Comrade Ossinsky
did the Russian into German.

2800
02:57:34,029 --> 02:57:36,532
Russian?

2801
02:57:36,657 --> 02:57:38,283
Who turned it into Russian
in the first place?

2802
02:57:38,367 --> 02:57:39,826
Well, I don't know.

2803
02:57:39,910 --> 02:57:41,662
They were already in Russian
when we got them

2804
02:57:41,745 --> 02:57:43,288
from the office of Comrade Zinoviev.

2805
02:57:45,624 --> 02:57:47,584
- I'm sorry for my English.
- Your English is fine, comrade.

2806
02:57:55,008 --> 02:57:58,428
Zinoviev, did you do
the translations of my speech?

2807
02:57:59,137 --> 02:58:00,806
I supervised it. Yes.

2808
02:58:00,931 --> 02:58:03,684
I didn't say "holy war."
I said "class war."

2809
02:58:03,809 --> 02:58:06,144
I took a liberty
of altering a phrase or two.

2810
02:58:06,603 --> 02:58:09,773
Yes, well, I don't allow people
to take those liberties with what I write.

2811
02:58:10,399 --> 02:58:13,443
Aren't you propagandist enough
to utilize what moves people most?

2812
02:58:13,569 --> 02:58:15,988
I'm propagandist enough
to utilize the truth.

2813
02:58:16,071 --> 02:58:19,700
And who defines this truth?
You or the party?

2814
02:58:19,783 --> 02:58:21,118
Is your life dedicated to speaking for...

2815
02:58:21,243 --> 02:58:23,370
You don't talk about what
my life is dedicated to!

2816
02:58:23,453 --> 02:58:26,039
Your life? You haven't resolved
what your life is dedicated to.

2817
02:58:26,123 --> 02:58:29,084
You see yourself as an artist
and at the same time as a revolutionary.

2818
02:58:29,209 --> 02:58:31,920
As a lover to your wife, but also as a
spokesman for the American classes.

2819
02:58:32,045 --> 02:58:33,881
Zinoviev, you don't think
a man can be an individual

2820
02:58:33,964 --> 02:58:35,465
and be true to the collective,

2821
02:58:35,591 --> 02:58:38,927
or speak for his own country
and the International at the same time,

2822
02:58:39,052 --> 02:58:42,097
or love his wife
and still be faithful to the revolution,

2823
02:58:42,222 --> 02:58:43,348
you don't have a self to give!

2824
02:58:43,432 --> 02:58:45,309
Would you ever be willing
to give yourself to this revolution?

2825
02:58:45,434 --> 02:58:47,227
When you separate a man
from what he loves the most,

2826
02:58:47,311 --> 02:58:49,771
what you do is purge
what's unique in him.

2827
02:58:49,897 --> 02:58:51,940
And when you purge
what's unique in him,

2828
02:58:52,065 --> 02:58:53,984
- you purge dissent.
- Comrade Reed.

2829
02:58:54,109 --> 02:58:56,528
And when you purge dissent,
you kill the revolution!

2830
02:58:56,612 --> 02:58:58,071
Revolution is dissent!

2831
02:58:58,155 --> 02:59:00,157
- Comrade Reed.
- You don't rewrite what I write!

2832
02:59:07,873 --> 02:59:10,375
Comrade Reed, counter-revolutionaries!

2833
02:59:10,918 --> 02:59:13,587
Counter-revolutionaries,
Comrade Reed!

2834
03:01:47,449 --> 03:01:48,659
Papa!

2835
03:01:51,453 --> 03:01:52,871
Papa!

2836
03:04:04,419 --> 03:04:05,879
Don't leave me.

2837
03:04:08,757 --> 03:04:10,175
Please don't leave me.

2838
03:04:25,440 --> 03:04:29,486
Comrade, the doctor
would like to see you now.

2839
03:04:44,251 --> 03:04:47,212
The doctor thinks
that we must do more analysis.

2840
03:04:47,296 --> 03:04:50,340
And a picture of his illness
will be clearer in a few days.

2841
03:04:50,465 --> 03:04:51,717
And he wants you to know

2842
03:04:51,800 --> 03:04:54,511
that we shall do the best conditions
for Comrade Reed

2843
03:04:54,636 --> 03:04:57,014
to prevent possibility
of high blood pressure

2844
03:04:57,139 --> 03:04:58,098
to cause a stroke.

2845
03:05:13,238 --> 03:05:16,366
I really... I know...

2846
03:05:17,701 --> 03:05:18,744
What?

2847
03:05:20,162 --> 03:05:21,580
How are you?

2848
03:05:25,918 --> 03:05:26,877
No.

2849
03:05:27,503 --> 03:05:28,545
Jack?

2850
03:05:52,486 --> 03:05:56,323
You know, I don't... I don't...

2851
03:06:05,457 --> 03:06:06,834
You hear it?

2852
03:06:07,668 --> 03:06:09,378
- Huh?
- What was that?

2853
03:06:10,170 --> 03:06:12,297
The water plays little songs.

2854
03:06:29,398 --> 03:06:32,693
It's not December, is it?

2855
03:06:50,752 --> 03:06:52,337
My, my, my, my.

2856
03:07:04,600 --> 03:07:07,436
God. What a time it was, huh?

2857
03:07:23,577 --> 03:07:25,871
- Want to come to New York with me?
- New York?

2858
03:07:26,246 --> 03:07:27,456
I got a taxi waiting.

2859
03:07:30,876 --> 03:07:32,586
I wouldn't mind.

2860
03:07:35,130 --> 03:07:36,673
What as?

2861
03:07:37,799 --> 03:07:38,967
What as?

2862
03:07:40,928 --> 03:07:42,095
What as?

2863
03:07:44,598 --> 03:07:46,266
Gee, I don't know.

2864
03:07:54,566 --> 03:07:55,692
Comrades?

2865
03:08:02,032 --> 03:08:03,283
Comrades.

2866
03:08:08,830 --> 03:08:10,666
Well, I want to go home.

2867
03:08:16,380 --> 03:08:17,422
Yeah.

2868
03:08:56,670 --> 03:08:58,172
I'll get you some water.

2869
03:10:41,775 --> 03:10:43,777
Oh, God.

2870
03:12:09,446 --> 03:12:11,198
It was in the afternoon,

2871
03:12:11,323 --> 03:12:14,409
sometime in the fall, I think.

2872
03:12:14,785 --> 03:12:16,370
October, I think.

2873
03:12:17,246 --> 03:12:19,164
Somebody came to tell me

2874
03:12:19,831 --> 03:12:21,542
that Jack Reed died.

2875
03:12:22,042 --> 03:12:25,003
You can imagine how...

2876
03:12:28,257 --> 03:12:29,925
How I felt.

2877
03:12:33,512 --> 03:12:35,556
I'd forgotten all about them.

2878
03:12:35,764 --> 03:12:37,516
Were they socialists?

2879
03:12:39,518 --> 03:12:41,895
Many of them were idealists.

2880
03:12:43,313 --> 03:12:46,900
You know,
things go and come back again.

2881
03:12:48,777 --> 03:12:52,072
I don't know what the outside world
thought of them,

2882
03:12:52,281 --> 03:12:54,575
but they were a couple.

2883
03:12:54,658 --> 03:12:58,328
I mean, you always spoke
of Louise Bryant and Jack Reed.

2884
03:13:00,706 --> 03:13:03,625
He was just a man in the prime of life.

2885
03:13:04,751 --> 03:13:07,796
I don't even know.
Did they ever have any children?

2886
03:13:09,006 --> 03:13:11,425
They probably didn't have any children,

2887
03:13:11,758 --> 03:13:13,218
he and Louise.

2888
03:13:15,888 --> 03:13:18,849
Again, you can't tell,
when you have children,

2889
03:13:19,808 --> 03:13:23,645
whether they will carry on
your revolutionary tradition or not.

2890
03:13:27,107 --> 03:13:28,984
Why did he do it?

2891
03:13:29,318 --> 03:13:32,279
Well, it's impossible to say

2892
03:13:32,404 --> 03:13:33,822
why Edison invented,

2893
03:13:33,947 --> 03:13:37,618
or why Galli-Curci sang...

2894
03:13:38,160 --> 03:13:41,997
He was definitely a stirrer-up of people.

2895
03:13:42,873 --> 03:13:44,583
That was his field.

2896
03:13:45,792 --> 03:13:48,378
That's what he came to do, apparently.

2897
03:13:49,671 --> 03:13:54,593
He's well-known amongst a few,
but not everybody.

2898
03:13:54,885 --> 03:13:57,429
They don't know who in heck he is.

2899
03:13:58,972 --> 03:14:02,643
I look for myself to die any day.

2900
03:14:07,231 --> 03:14:09,608
He was asked by Lenin,
"Are you an American?"

2901
03:14:10,567 --> 03:14:11,527
He said, "Yes."

2902
03:14:11,652 --> 03:14:14,321
And Lenin said,
"An American American?"

2903
03:14:15,447 --> 03:14:16,949
And Reed said, "Yes."

2904
03:14:19,743 --> 03:14:24,122
Of course,
nobody goes with the idea of dying.

2905
03:14:24,206 --> 03:14:27,167
Everybody wants to live.

2906
03:14:29,211 --> 03:14:32,673
I don't remember his exact words,

2907
03:14:32,756 --> 03:14:34,633
but the meaning was

2908
03:14:35,759 --> 03:14:39,680
that grand things are ahead,

2909
03:14:42,057 --> 03:14:46,270
worth living and worth dying for.

2910
03:14:46,854 --> 03:14:49,439
He himself said that.
