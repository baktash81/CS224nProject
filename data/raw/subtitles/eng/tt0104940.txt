1
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:45,921
- Ah. It was a fine meal.
- Yes, it was, wasn't it?

2
00:02:45,995 --> 00:02:47,588
Yes, what should we do now?

3
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:51,435
- Let's have lunch.
- Oh, good idea.

4
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:53,477
Quiet down, you villains.

5
00:02:53,543 --> 00:02:56,105
I'm being stolen.
Help me, help me!

6
00:02:56,182 --> 00:02:58,047
Put me down!

7
00:03:00,623 --> 00:03:01,851
Hello.

8
00:03:08,036 --> 00:03:09,835
What about my nose?

9
00:03:12,446 --> 00:03:15,042
Banana peels coming down!

10
00:03:17,387 --> 00:03:20,381
Come along, ladies.
Here's a nice Christmas turkey.

11
00:03:20,461 --> 00:03:23,227
Turkey.
Get your Christmas turkey.

12
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:26,533
Hey, get back in the box, Martin!

13
00:03:26,604 --> 00:03:30,511
Get your boomerang fish.
Guaranteed fresh.

14
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:34,577
Throw the fish away
and it comes back to me.

15
00:03:34,654 --> 00:03:36,419
Get 'em while they're fresh.

16
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:38,585
- Christmas apples.
- We got Macintosh.

17
00:03:38,661 --> 00:03:40,632
- Christmas apples.
- Red Delicious.

18
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:42,601
Tuppence apiece, while they last.

19
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:45,869
We... They won't last long
the way you're eating them.

20
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:48,708
I'm creating scarcity.
Drives the prices up.

21
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,717
Rizzo...

22
00:03:50,785 --> 00:03:54,690
Hello. Welcome to
the Muppet Christmas Carol.

23
00:03:54,758 --> 00:03:56,488
I am here to tell the story.

24
00:03:56,562 --> 00:03:58,325
And I am here for the food.

25
00:03:58,398 --> 00:04:00,197
My name is Charles Dickens.

26
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:02,262
And my name is Rizzo the Rat.

27
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,039
Wait a second,
you're not Charles Dickens.

28
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:06,340
I am, too.

29
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,408
A blue furry Charles Dickens
who hangs out with a rat?

30
00:04:09,487 --> 00:04:10,614
Absolutely.

31
00:04:10,688 --> 00:04:13,489
Charles Dickens
was a 19th century novelist.

32
00:04:13,562 --> 00:04:14,790
A genius.

33
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:16,661
You are too kind.

34
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:18,636
Why should I believe you?

35
00:04:18,704 --> 00:04:22,302
<i>Because I know the story of A Christmas
Carol like the back of my hand.</i>

36
00:04:22,377 --> 00:04:24,575
- Prove it.
- All right.

37
00:04:24,648 --> 00:04:27,016
There's a little mole on my thumb.

38
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:30,581
And a scar on my wrist
from when I fell off my bicycle...

39
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,598
No, don't tell us your hand,
tell us the story.

40
00:04:33,665 --> 00:04:35,760
Oh, thank you. Yes.

41
00:04:35,835 --> 00:04:38,966
The Marleys were dead,
to begin with.

42
00:04:39,043 --> 00:04:40,238
The... Pardon me?

43
00:04:40,312 --> 00:04:42,042
That's how the story begins,

44
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:44,516
"The Marleys were dead,
to begin with."

45
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:47,022
As dead as a doornail.

46
00:04:47,091 --> 00:04:50,494
It's a good beginning.
It's creepy and kind of... spooky.

47
00:04:50,564 --> 00:04:53,262
- Thank you, Rizzo.
- You're welcome, Mr. Dickens.

48
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:56,103
In life, the Marleys had been
business partners

49
00:04:56,176 --> 00:05:00,582
with a shrewd moneylender
named Ebenezer Scrooge.

50
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,747
You will meet him
as he comes around that corner.

51
00:05:03,822 --> 00:05:05,121
- Where?
- There.

52
00:05:05,192 --> 00:05:07,287
- When?
- Now.

53
00:05:09,232 --> 00:05:12,693
There he is,
Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge.

54
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,083
Say, is it getting cold around here?

55
00:05:25,563 --> 00:05:28,364
<i>When a cold wind blows,
it chills you</i>

56
00:05:28,436 --> 00:05:30,428
<i>Chills you to the bone</i>

57
00:05:30,505 --> 00:05:32,999
<i>But there's nothing in nature
that freezes your heart</i>

58
00:05:33,077 --> 00:05:35,071
<i>Like years of being alone</i>

59
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:37,948
<i>It paints you with indifference</i>

60
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,354
<i>Like a lady paints with rouge</i>

61
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:42,862
<i>And the worst of the worst,
the most hated and cursed</i>

62
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,264
<i>Is the one that we call Scrooge</i>

63
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,770
<i>- Unkind as any
- And the wrath of many</i>

64
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,865
<i>This is Ebenezer Scrooge</i>

65
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:54,885
<i>There goes Mr. Humbug
There goes Mr. Grim</i>

66
00:05:54,952 --> 00:05:57,582
<i>If they gave a prize for being mean</i>

67
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,751
<i>The winner would be him</i>

68
00:05:59,828 --> 00:06:01,855
<i>Old Scrooge, he loves his money</i>

69
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:04,699
<i>'Cause he thinks it gives him power</i>

70
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:10,805
<i>If he became a flavor
You can bet he would be sour</i>

71
00:06:10,882 --> 00:06:13,148
Even the vegetables don't like him.

72
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:19,353
<i>There goes Mr. Skinflint
There goes Mr. Greed</i>

73
00:06:19,832 --> 00:06:24,500
<i>The undisputed master
of the underhanded deed</i>

74
00:06:24,575 --> 00:06:26,635
<i>He charges folks a fortune</i>

75
00:06:26,712 --> 00:06:29,410
<i>For his dark and drafty houses</i>

76
00:06:29,483 --> 00:06:31,817
<i>Us poor folk live in misery</i>

77
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:35,383
<i>It's even worse for mouses</i>

78
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:38,991
Please, sir, I want some cheese.

79
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:41,631
<i>He must be so lonely</i>

80
00:06:41,707 --> 00:06:44,007
<i>He must be so sad</i>

81
00:06:44,077 --> 00:06:48,848
<i>He goes to extremes
to convince us he's bad</i>

82
00:06:48,921 --> 00:06:51,414
<i>He's really a victim</i>

83
00:06:51,493 --> 00:06:53,894
<i>Of fear and of pride</i>

84
00:06:53,963 --> 00:06:59,601
<i>Look close and there must be
a sweet man inside</i>

85
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:01,901
- Nah.
- Uh-uh.

86
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:04,415
<i>There goes Mr. Outrage</i>

87
00:07:04,483 --> 00:07:06,952
<i>There goes Mr. Sneer</i>

88
00:07:07,021 --> 00:07:09,253
<i>He has no time for friends or fun</i>

89
00:07:09,326 --> 00:07:11,455
<i>His anger makes that clear</i>

90
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:16,300
<i>Don't ask him for a favor
'cause his nastiness increases</i>

91
00:07:16,372 --> 00:07:18,936
<i>No crust of bread for those in need</i>

92
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:21,880
<i>No cheeses for us "meeces"</i>

93
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:23,679
Scrooge liked the cold.

94
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:26,019
He was hard and sharp as a flint.

95
00:07:26,091 --> 00:07:27,924
Secret and self-contained.

96
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:30,157
As solitary as an oyster.

97
00:07:30,232 --> 00:07:32,532
<i>There goes Mr. Heartless</i>

98
00:07:32,603 --> 00:07:34,799
<i>There goes Mr. Cruel</i>

99
00:07:34,874 --> 00:07:37,437
<i>He never gives
He only takes</i>

100
00:07:37,512 --> 00:07:39,709
<i>He lets his hunger rule</i>

101
00:07:39,784 --> 00:07:44,588
<i>If being mean's a way of life
you practice and rehearse</i>

102
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,130
<i>Then all that work is paying off</i>

103
00:07:47,197 --> 00:07:49,861
<i>'Cause Scrooge is getting worse</i>

104
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:54,603
<i>Every day, in every way
Scrooge is getting worse</i>

105
00:07:55,446 --> 00:07:57,473
- [male] Oh, boy.
- How the time flies.

106
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,486
Look at this, I've got to move...

107
00:08:03,394 --> 00:08:04,726
Humbug.

108
00:08:10,942 --> 00:08:14,711
Phew! What an unpleasant fellow.

109
00:08:14,782 --> 00:08:20,190
He was a tightfisted hand
at the grindstone, Scroo...

110
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:22,729
Boy, this really is a dirty city.

111
00:08:22,796 --> 00:08:25,166
Ha. You tellin' me.

112
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,573
Thank you for making me
a part of this.

113
00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:35,587
He was a tightfisted hand
at the grindstone, Scrooge.

114
00:08:35,656 --> 00:08:39,754
A squeezing, wrenching,
grasping, clutching...

115
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:42,129
covetous old sinner.

116
00:08:44,138 --> 00:08:45,801
Bob Cratchit?

117
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,070
Yes, Mr. Scrooge?

118
00:08:47,144 --> 00:08:48,874
Who is this?

119
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:50,574
Mr. Applegate, sir.

120
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:53,280
He's here to speak to you
about his... mortgage.

121
00:08:53,355 --> 00:08:55,690
Mr. Scrooge,
I know you're very angry about this,

122
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,286
and I didn't mean to
fall behind in the payment.

123
00:08:58,365 --> 00:09:00,733
Lord knows,
it being Christmas and all.

124
00:09:00,803 --> 00:09:02,898
Please don't shout at me, sir.

125
00:09:02,973 --> 00:09:06,002
That and, of course, little Gwen.
Her lungs aren't right.

126
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,345
The doctor takes his share, don't he?

127
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:10,512
You can yell and scream,
and you're right,

128
00:09:10,588 --> 00:09:12,353
but it won't do no good...

129
00:09:12,424 --> 00:09:15,089
because I'm the stone
you can't squeeze blood from.

130
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:17,428
And that's the truth!

131
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,800
Thank you for not shouting at me.

132
00:09:19,872 --> 00:09:22,741
[Workers] 17... 42...

133
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,272
Let us deal with the eviction notices
for tomorrow, Mr. Cratchit.

134
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:28,183
Uh...

135
00:09:28,255 --> 00:09:29,723
Tomorrow's Christmas, sir.

136
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:33,595
Very well, you may gift wrap them.

137
00:09:33,664 --> 00:09:36,158
Let us help you with that,
Mr. Cratchit.

138
00:09:36,236 --> 00:09:38,502
My, there are certainly a lot today.

139
00:09:38,573 --> 00:09:39,564
We'll get it.

140
00:09:39,643 --> 00:09:41,875
I'm okay, okay.

141
00:09:41,947 --> 00:09:43,882
- Here you go.
- Look out on that end...

142
00:09:46,054 --> 00:09:47,989
- Uh...
- [workers] Whoa!

143
00:09:49,394 --> 00:09:52,525
Christmas is a very busy time for us,
Mr. Cratchit.

144
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,833
People preparing feasts, giving parties.

145
00:09:55,906 --> 00:09:59,438
Spending the mortgage money
on frivolities.

146
00:09:59,513 --> 00:10:03,214
One might say that December
is the foreclosure season.

147
00:10:03,288 --> 00:10:07,695
Harvest time for the moneylenders.

148
00:10:07,763 --> 00:10:09,288
- Boss, ask him.
- Tell him.

149
00:10:09,366 --> 00:10:12,599
- Come on. Come on.
- Do it now. Do it.

150
00:10:12,672 --> 00:10:15,541
If you please, Mr. Scrooge,
it's gotten colder.

151
00:10:15,611 --> 00:10:19,345
The bookkeeping staff would like to have
an extra shovel of coal for the fire.

152
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:22,446
- We can't do the bookkeeping.
- Our pens are like ink-cicles.

153
00:10:22,524 --> 00:10:24,356
Our assets are frozen.

154
00:10:24,427 --> 00:10:28,231
How would the bookkeepers
like to be suddenly unemployed?

155
00:10:28,301 --> 00:10:30,134
Heat wave!

156
00:10:30,205 --> 00:10:33,664
This is my island in the sun!

157
00:10:33,745 --> 00:10:37,081
I, I believe you've convinced them
once again, Mr. Scrooge.

158
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,091
At that moment,
who should arrive at the door

159
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:47,261
but Scrooge's nephew, Fred.
His only living relative.

160
00:10:47,337 --> 00:10:49,830
- Nephew Fred? I don't see him.
- Trust me.

161
00:10:51,343 --> 00:10:53,473
Hello? Uncle?

162
00:10:55,686 --> 00:10:56,677
Rizzo?

163
00:10:56,755 --> 00:10:59,191
You're very good at that, Mr. Dickens.

164
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,527
A merry Christmas, Uncle Scrooge.
God save you.

165
00:11:02,598 --> 00:11:04,193
Merry Christmas?

166
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:06,535
Bah. Humbug!

167
00:11:06,607 --> 00:11:08,599
Quick, it'll be warmer in there.

168
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:16,451
Christmas a humbug, Uncle?
You don't mean that, surely.

169
00:11:16,526 --> 00:11:18,553
Actually, I think it's colder in here.

170
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:21,533
Merry Christmas, you say?
What right have you to be merry?

171
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,093
You're poor enough.

172
00:11:23,172 --> 00:11:25,335
And you to be dismal?
You're rich enough.

173
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:27,571
He's got him.
The old boy's speechless.

174
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,707
If I could work my will,

175
00:11:29,783 --> 00:11:32,949
every idiot who goes about with
"Merry Christmas" on his lips

176
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:34,855
would be cooked with his own turkey

177
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:37,989
and buried with a stake of holly
through his heart.

178
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:39,898
Well, not quite speechless.

179
00:11:39,969 --> 00:11:41,461
- Uncle...
- Nephew.

180
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,411
You keep Christmas in your own way,
and let me keep it in mine.

181
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,420
Christmas is a loving,
honest and charitable time.

182
00:11:49,488 --> 00:11:53,018
And though it's never put
a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket,

183
00:11:53,095 --> 00:11:55,827
I believe Christmas has done me good
and will do me good,

184
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,561
and I say, God bless it.

185
00:11:59,507 --> 00:12:03,344
And how does one celebrate Christmas
on the unemployment line?

186
00:12:05,619 --> 00:12:08,590
Now, in these times,
it was customary on Christmas Eve

187
00:12:08,657 --> 00:12:11,356
for well-meaning gentlemen
to call upon businesses,

188
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:15,129
collecting donations
for the poor and homeless.

189
00:12:15,804 --> 00:12:17,829
Mr. Scrooge, I presume?

190
00:12:20,345 --> 00:12:21,541
Who are you?

191
00:12:21,614 --> 00:12:25,314
We're from the Order of Victoria
Charity Foundation.

192
00:12:25,388 --> 00:12:28,189
We'd like to speak to you
about a donation.

193
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,196
Ah! Welcome!

194
00:12:30,265 --> 00:12:32,860
This jolly old gentleman here
is Mr. Scrooge.

195
00:12:32,937 --> 00:12:35,305
He's very generous to charities.

196
00:12:35,373 --> 00:12:36,899
My dear nephew!

197
00:12:36,976 --> 00:12:40,041
At this festive season of the year,
Mr. Scrooge,

198
00:12:40,116 --> 00:12:44,420
many of us feel we must
take care of our poor and homeless.

199
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,053
Are there no prisons?
No poor houses?

200
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:49,395
Oh, plenty of those, sir.

201
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:51,130
Oh. Excellent.

202
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,002
For a moment, I was worried.

203
00:12:53,074 --> 00:12:57,345
Some of us are endeavoring to raise
a fund for the poor and homeless.

204
00:12:57,417 --> 00:12:59,817
What might I put you down for?

205
00:12:59,887 --> 00:13:00,911
Nothing.

206
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:05,054
- You wish to remain anonymous?
- I wish to be left alone.

207
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:07,191
I do not make merry myself
for Christmas.

208
00:13:07,268 --> 00:13:08,361
That certainly is true.

209
00:13:08,503 --> 00:13:10,473
I cannot afford
to make idle people merry.

210
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,098
That is certainly not true.

211
00:13:12,176 --> 00:13:14,806
Don't you have other things to do
this afternoon?

212
00:13:14,882 --> 00:13:18,342
Sadly, I do, Uncle.
So I shall make my donation.

213
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,051
And leave you to make yours.

214
00:13:21,128 --> 00:13:22,858
Thank you so very much.

215
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:27,098
Oh, Uncle, come and have Christmas
dinner with me and Clara tomorrow.

216
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:29,005
Why ever did you get married?

217
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:31,101
Why? Because I fell in love.

218
00:13:33,282 --> 00:13:36,551
That's the only thing in the world
sillier than a merry Christmas.

219
00:13:36,623 --> 00:13:39,493
It's no use, I shall keep
my Christmas humor to the last.

220
00:13:39,561 --> 00:13:43,001
A merry Christmas to you.
And a happy New Year.

221
00:13:43,068 --> 00:13:45,472
- Merry Christmas, Fred.
- Merry Christmas, Bob.

222
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,872
Humbug!

223
00:13:48,111 --> 00:13:49,876
Ahem.

224
00:13:58,365 --> 00:14:01,130
Now, then, sir, about the...

225
00:14:01,203 --> 00:14:02,899
donation.

226
00:14:03,607 --> 00:14:05,474
Well, now.

227
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:07,274
Let's see.

228
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:11,510
I know how to treat the poor.

229
00:14:11,588 --> 00:14:15,028
My taxes go to pay for the prisons
and the poorhouses.

230
00:14:15,096 --> 00:14:17,861
- The homeless must go there.
- But some would rather die.

231
00:14:17,934 --> 00:14:20,530
If they'd rather die,
then they'd better do it,

232
00:14:20,605 --> 00:14:22,599
and decrease the surplus population.

233
00:14:22,676 --> 00:14:25,340
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

234
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:29,320
This is the door, you may use it.

235
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:31,255
All right, Beaker, come along.

236
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:35,265
I think we've taken enough
of Mr. Scrooge's time.

237
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:38,237
Oh, dear. Dear, dear.

238
00:14:38,305 --> 00:14:41,972
[Workers] 17... 24... 58.

239
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,108
<i>Good King Wencelas looked out
on the Feast of Stephen</i>

240
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:48,386
<i>Though the snow lay round about,
deep and crisp and even</i>

241
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:51,260
<i>Brightly shone the moon
that... night,</i>

242
00:14:51,331 --> 00:14:52,924
<i>Though... the...</i>

243
00:14:55,137 --> 00:14:59,408
- What do you want?
- Uh... Penny for the song, guvnor?

244
00:15:05,724 --> 00:15:07,249
Wh... Ow!

245
00:15:10,334 --> 00:15:12,030
17... 24...

246
00:15:25,662 --> 00:15:30,866
Excuse me, Mr. Scrooge,
but it appears to be closing time.

247
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:36,208
Very well. I'll see you
at eight tomorrow morning.

248
00:15:37,486 --> 00:15:38,817
Ask him, ask him.

249
00:15:38,888 --> 00:15:40,686
Um... Tomorrow's Christmas.

250
00:15:40,758 --> 00:15:43,058
8:30, then.

251
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:44,528
If you please, sir,

252
00:15:44,597 --> 00:15:47,502
half an hour off hardly seems customary
for Christmas Day.

253
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:50,508
- [Worker] No.
- [Worker 2] Hardly customary.

254
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:53,343
How much time off is customary,
Mr. Cratchit?

255
00:15:53,415 --> 00:15:57,013
Um... Why, um, the, er, whole day.

256
00:15:57,088 --> 00:15:58,954
- Yeah, that's right.
- The whole day.

257
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:00,391
The entire day?

258
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,487
- No.
- That's the frog's idea.

259
00:16:02,565 --> 00:16:05,662
If you please,
why open the office tomorrow?

260
00:16:05,738 --> 00:16:09,233
Other businesses will be closed.
You'll have no one to do business with.

261
00:16:09,311 --> 00:16:12,772
It'll waste a lot of expensive coal
for the fire.

262
00:16:12,851 --> 00:16:16,017
- That's definitely a point.
- That's a point.

263
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:19,825
It's a poor excuse for picking
a man's pocket every December the 25th.

264
00:16:22,669 --> 00:16:25,904
But as I seem to be
the only person around who knows that...

265
00:16:27,212 --> 00:16:29,910
...take the day off.

266
00:16:34,425 --> 00:16:36,658
Will you stop that?

267
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:40,058
Thank you, Mr. Scrooge.

268
00:16:41,771 --> 00:16:43,743
Be here all the earlier
the next morning.

269
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,441
- [Worker] Okay.
- [Worker 2] You bet. First thing.

270
00:16:49,754 --> 00:16:51,916
With their employer gone at last,

271
00:16:51,991 --> 00:16:54,622
Bob Cratchit and the bookkeepers
immediately began

272
00:16:54,697 --> 00:16:59,536
that most pleasant of activities,
the celebration of Christmas.

273
00:16:59,605 --> 00:17:02,577
He's gone!

274
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,979
Gentlemen, let's close up for Christmas.

275
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:09,790
<i>There's magic in the air this evening</i>

276
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:11,987
<i>Magic in the air</i>

277
00:17:12,063 --> 00:17:14,829
<i>The world is at her best, you know</i>

278
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:17,338
<i>When people love and care</i>

279
00:17:17,406 --> 00:17:21,870
<i>The promise of excitement
is one the night will keep</i>

280
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:26,890
<i>After all, there's only
one more sleep till Christmas</i>

281
00:17:37,778 --> 00:17:39,679
<i>The world has got a smile</i>

282
00:17:39,748 --> 00:17:42,743
<i>Today, the world has got a glow</i>

283
00:17:42,821 --> 00:17:45,622
<i>There's no such thing as strangers</i>

284
00:17:45,692 --> 00:17:47,718
<i>When a stranger says hello</i>

285
00:17:47,797 --> 00:17:50,324
<i>And everyone is family</i>

286
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,702
<i>We're having so much fun</i>

287
00:17:52,773 --> 00:17:57,714
<i>After all, there's only one
more sleep till Christmas</i>

288
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,017
Okay, ready. Here we go.

289
00:18:16,918 --> 00:18:18,443
That's it. Ha! Ha!

290
00:18:18,523 --> 00:18:20,514
Mm-hm.

291
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:24,725
Very good, gentlemen.

292
00:18:26,603 --> 00:18:31,101
<i>'Tis the season to be jolly and joyous</i>

293
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,520
<i>With a burst of pleasure,
we feel it arrive</i>

294
00:18:37,056 --> 00:18:41,588
<i>It's a season
when the saints can employ us</i>

295
00:18:41,665 --> 00:18:46,540
<i>To spread the news about peace
and to keep love alive</i>

296
00:18:46,607 --> 00:18:47,837
What's that?

297
00:18:47,911 --> 00:18:50,883
Look, it's the penguins'
Christmas skating party.

298
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:09,677
- Hmm. Ah.
- Look at that!

299
00:19:16,165 --> 00:19:18,292
You did good, boss.

300
00:19:18,368 --> 00:19:21,396
Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much.

301
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,885
Wow!

302
00:19:27,952 --> 00:19:30,184
- No way.
- Come on, Rizzo.

303
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,190
Boy.

304
00:19:39,742 --> 00:19:41,039
Fun, huh?

305
00:19:41,111 --> 00:19:43,411
Merry Christmas, penguins.

306
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:48,088
<i>There's something in the wind today</i>

307
00:19:48,158 --> 00:19:50,753
<i>That's good for everyone</i>

308
00:19:50,828 --> 00:19:53,356
<i>Yes, faith is in our hearts today</i>

309
00:19:53,435 --> 00:19:55,666
<i>We're shining like the sun</i>

310
00:19:55,738 --> 00:19:58,402
<i>And everyone can feel it</i>

311
00:19:58,477 --> 00:20:00,570
<i>The feeling's running deep</i>

312
00:20:00,647 --> 00:20:05,645
<i>After all, there's only
one more sleep till Christmas</i>

313
00:20:05,724 --> 00:20:09,823
<i>After all, there's only one more sleep</i>

314
00:20:09,898 --> 00:20:14,465
<i>Till Christmas Day</i>

315
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,532
Merry Christmas!

316
00:20:35,546 --> 00:20:38,278
Scrooge lived in chambers
which had once belonged

317
00:20:38,351 --> 00:20:41,450
to his old business partners,
Jacob and Robert Marley.

318
00:20:41,525 --> 00:20:43,551
- Have some bread?
- Not while I'm working.

319
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:45,598
Suit yourself.

320
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:49,628
The building was a dismal heap of brick
on a dark street.

321
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:52,974
Once again, you must remember
that the Marleys were dead

322
00:20:53,046 --> 00:20:55,812
- and decaying in their graves.
- Yeuch!

323
00:20:55,885 --> 00:20:58,116
That one thing
you must remember,

324
00:20:58,189 --> 00:21:00,626
or nothing that follows
will seem wondrous.

325
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:02,219
Why are you whispering?

326
00:21:02,297 --> 00:21:04,494
- It's for dramatic emphasis.
- Oh.

327
00:21:04,568 --> 00:21:06,002
Shh.

328
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,248
Jacob Marley?

329
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,387
You okay?

330
00:21:49,453 --> 00:21:50,784
Humbug.

331
00:21:53,794 --> 00:21:56,264
Oh. Gonzo, speak to me.

332
00:21:56,332 --> 00:22:00,170
I mean, Mr. Dickens.
Charlie! Are you hurt?

333
00:22:00,239 --> 00:22:03,405
To say that Scrooge
was not startled would be untrue.

334
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:06,918
Still, the moment had passed,
and the world was as it should be.

335
00:22:06,986 --> 00:22:09,547
He ain't hurt.
Didn't even break his concentration.

336
00:22:09,623 --> 00:22:11,355
- Hmm?
- Nothing.

337
00:22:16,103 --> 00:22:18,835
Come on, Rizzo.
We'll follow him in.

338
00:22:18,907 --> 00:22:22,506
In a minute.
I had a bag of jelly beans over here.

339
00:22:22,581 --> 00:22:24,312
Will you just get over here?

340
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,548
- All right.
- Sheesh.

341
00:22:27,992 --> 00:22:30,121
Oh-oh.

342
00:22:31,866 --> 00:22:32,993
Steady, steady.

343
00:22:33,069 --> 00:22:35,539
Scrooge made his way up the stairs,

344
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:37,598
caring not a button for the darkness.

345
00:22:37,677 --> 00:22:40,239
Darkness was cheap,
and Scrooge liked it.

346
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:46,154
<i>But the incident at the door
had made Scrooge wary.</i>

347
00:22:46,226 --> 00:22:50,563
<i>Before he shut himself in for the night,
he searched his rooms.</i>

348
00:22:50,634 --> 00:22:53,070
<i>- [Rizzo] Okay, that does it.
- [Dickens] Pardon?</i>

349
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,406
How do you know
what Scrooge is doing?

350
00:22:55,478 --> 00:22:57,674
We're down here and he's up there.

351
00:22:57,749 --> 00:23:01,519
I keep telling you, storytellers
are omniscient. I know everything.

352
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:04,492
Hoity-toity, Mr. Godlike Smarty-Pants.

353
00:23:06,866 --> 00:23:10,828
To conduct a proper search,
Scrooge was forced to light the lamps.

354
00:23:12,576 --> 00:23:14,307
How does he do that?

355
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:49,168
Agh!

356
00:23:57,193 --> 00:23:58,492
Oh.

357
00:23:59,632 --> 00:24:01,965
It's my best dressing gown.

358
00:24:05,342 --> 00:24:07,438
No harm done.

359
00:25:20,884 --> 00:25:23,583
Look, it's Ebenezer Scrooge.

360
00:25:23,658 --> 00:25:26,390
Looking older and more wicked
than ever.

361
00:25:26,461 --> 00:25:28,522
I knew he wouldn't disappoint us.

362
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:34,468
Who are you?

363
00:25:34,544 --> 00:25:36,513
In life, we were your partners,

364
00:25:36,581 --> 00:25:39,849
- Jacob...
- And Robert Marley.

365
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,050
It looks like you.

366
00:25:42,126 --> 00:25:46,064
- But I don't believe it.
- Why do you doubt your senses?

367
00:25:46,132 --> 00:25:49,262
Because a little thing
can affect them.

368
00:25:49,338 --> 00:25:52,833
A slight disorder of the stomach
can make them cheat.

369
00:25:52,913 --> 00:25:56,783
You may be a bit of undigested beef.
A blob of mustard.

370
00:25:56,852 --> 00:25:58,650
A crumb of cheese.

371
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:02,355
Yes, there's more of gravy
than of grave about you.

372
00:26:05,035 --> 00:26:07,164
More of gravy than of grave?

373
00:26:07,238 --> 00:26:10,269
What a terrible pun.
Where do you get those jokes?

374
00:26:10,345 --> 00:26:12,508
Leave comedy to the bears, Ebenezer.

375
00:26:14,552 --> 00:26:18,515
Please, Jacob, Robert,
don't criticize me.

376
00:26:18,594 --> 00:26:20,360
You always criticized me.

377
00:26:20,431 --> 00:26:22,264
We were always heckling you.

378
00:26:22,334 --> 00:26:24,269
It's good to be heckling again.

379
00:26:24,338 --> 00:26:26,501
It's good to be doing anything again.

380
00:26:28,547 --> 00:26:30,243
Why do you come to me?

381
00:26:30,316 --> 00:26:35,223
<i>We're Marley and Marley
Avarice and greed</i>

382
00:26:35,292 --> 00:26:40,029
<i>We took advantage of the poor,
just ignored the need-y</i>

383
00:26:40,102 --> 00:26:44,508
<i>We specialized in causing pain,
spreading fear and doubt</i>

384
00:26:44,576 --> 00:26:48,880
<i>And if you could not pay the rent,
we simply threw you out</i>

385
00:26:50,287 --> 00:26:53,316
There was the year
we evicted the entire orphanage.

386
00:26:53,393 --> 00:26:57,596
I remember the little tykes
all standing in the snowbank.

387
00:26:57,668 --> 00:27:00,503
With their little
frostbitten teddy bears.

388
00:27:04,213 --> 00:27:08,622
<i>We're Marley and Marley
Our hearts were painted black</i>

389
00:27:08,688 --> 00:27:11,285
<i>We should have known our evil deeds</i>

390
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,956
<i>Would put us both in shack-les</i>

391
00:27:14,031 --> 00:27:18,301
<i>Captive, bound, we're double-ironed,
exhausted by the weight</i>

392
00:27:18,373 --> 00:27:20,866
<i>As freedom comes from giving love</i>

393
00:27:20,945 --> 00:27:23,278
<i>So prison comes with hate</i>

394
00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:25,479
<i>We're Marley and Marley</i>

395
00:27:28,459 --> 00:27:30,452
<i>We're Marley and Marley</i>

396
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,704
But my friends, you were not unfeeling
towards your fellow men.

397
00:27:35,773 --> 00:27:39,041
True, there was something
about mankind we loved.

398
00:27:39,113 --> 00:27:40,878
I think it was their money.

399
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:47,424
<i>Doomed, Scrooge
You're doomed for all time</i>

400
00:27:47,495 --> 00:27:52,232
<i>Your future is a horror story
Written by your crime</i>

401
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:57,075
<i>Your chains are forged
by what you say and do</i>

402
00:27:57,146 --> 00:27:59,743
<i>So have your fun
When life is done</i>

403
00:27:59,818 --> 00:28:01,651
<i>A nightmare waits for you</i>

404
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:04,993
Why these terrible chains?

405
00:28:05,062 --> 00:28:07,760
The chains.

406
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:11,863
We forged these chains in life
by our acts of greed.

407
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,070
You wear such a chain yourself.

408
00:28:14,145 --> 00:28:16,911
Humbug. Speak comfort to me, friends.

409
00:28:16,984 --> 00:28:18,453
Comfort!

410
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:23,191
You will be haunted by three spirits.

411
00:28:23,262 --> 00:28:25,527
Haunted?
I've already had enough of that.

412
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,802
Without these visits, you cannot hope
to avoid the path we tread.

413
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:33,370
Expect the first ghost tonight,
when the bell tolls one.

414
00:28:33,447 --> 00:28:35,816
Can't I meet them all at once
and get it over with?

415
00:28:35,885 --> 00:28:39,016
When the bell tolls one!

416
00:28:39,091 --> 00:28:41,086
<i>We're Marley and Marley</i>

417
00:28:43,701 --> 00:28:45,967
<i>We're Marley and Marley</i>

418
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:50,904
<i>We're Marley and Marley</i>

419
00:28:54,288 --> 00:28:55,813
Change!

420
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:11,347
And with that, the spirits of Scrooge's
partners vanished into the darkness,

421
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:16,225
leaving him once again
alone in his room.

422
00:29:16,295 --> 00:29:20,396
That's scary stuff. Should we be worried
about the kids in the audience?

423
00:29:20,471 --> 00:29:22,906
No, it's all right. This is culture.

424
00:29:22,975 --> 00:29:25,912
Jelly bean? I had them
in my pocket all along.

425
00:29:27,449 --> 00:29:28,441
What?

426
00:29:40,842 --> 00:29:42,175
Humbug.

427
00:29:43,313 --> 00:29:45,111
Come on.

428
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:46,812
But I really hate this.

429
00:29:46,887 --> 00:29:48,857
You wanted to know
what was happening.

430
00:29:48,924 --> 00:29:52,363
Scrooge's bedchamber
is on this side of the house. Jump.

431
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:55,059
There's only two things
in this life I hate.

432
00:29:55,135 --> 00:29:57,367
Heights, and jumping from them.

433
00:29:57,439 --> 00:29:59,671
Too late now.
Come on, I'll catch you.

434
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,915
God save my little broken body.

435
00:30:10,465 --> 00:30:12,330
Missed.

436
00:30:12,402 --> 00:30:15,100
Wait a second.
I forgot my jelly beans.

437
00:30:15,174 --> 00:30:16,233
Um...

438
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,184
What?

439
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,092
You can fit through those bars?

440
00:30:27,164 --> 00:30:28,688
Yeah.

441
00:30:28,765 --> 00:30:30,166
You are such an idiot.

442
00:30:30,235 --> 00:30:32,171
What, what? Hey, what?

443
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,970
What?

444
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:35,568
What?

445
00:30:49,437 --> 00:30:51,031
Oh, dear.

446
00:30:51,108 --> 00:30:55,482
Scrooge slipped into the empty silence
of a dreamless sleep.

447
00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:59,010
You know, a guy could break his tail
falling out of this tree.

448
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:01,082
Want to see what's going on, don't you?

449
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,289
- Yes.
- There's Scrooge's window.

450
00:31:03,364 --> 00:31:05,163
Oh, yeah.

451
00:31:24,338 --> 00:31:29,405
Expect the first ghost
when the bell tolls one!

452
00:31:32,219 --> 00:31:33,950
Wow! Ouch.

453
00:31:55,429 --> 00:31:58,731
Are you the spirit
whose coming was foretold to me?

454
00:31:58,802 --> 00:32:00,032
I am.

455
00:32:00,105 --> 00:32:04,603
But... you're just a child.

456
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,845
I can remember nearly 1,900 years.

457
00:32:07,918 --> 00:32:11,086
I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.

458
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,923
What business has brought you here?

459
00:32:12,996 --> 00:32:15,694
- Your welfare.
- Huh.

460
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,433
A night's unbroken rest
might aid my welfare.

461
00:32:18,506 --> 00:32:20,702
Your salvation, then.

462
00:32:20,778 --> 00:32:23,475
Take heed. Come.

463
00:32:28,358 --> 00:32:32,262
I beg you, spirit, I am mortal.
I'm liable to fall.

464
00:32:32,332 --> 00:32:35,667
A touch of my hand, and you shall fly.

465
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:45,579
- What are we doing?
- Nothing.

466
00:32:45,656 --> 00:32:47,286
- What?
- Just hold on.

467
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:54,531
- Watch out, Rizzo.
- What? Oh!

468
00:32:54,607 --> 00:32:57,637
Whee!

469
00:32:58,314 --> 00:33:00,112
Hello, London!

470
00:33:00,185 --> 00:33:02,212
Goodbye, lunch!

471
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:05,920
Spirit?

472
00:33:06,698 --> 00:33:07,824
Yes?

473
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,597
Nothing.

474
00:33:11,405 --> 00:33:13,705
- Look, Rizzo.
- I don't want to look.

475
00:33:13,776 --> 00:33:16,577
Spirit? What is that light?

476
00:33:18,152 --> 00:33:20,019
It cannot be dawn.

477
00:33:20,088 --> 00:33:22,388
It is the past.

478
00:33:25,533 --> 00:33:28,163
Look, it's beautiful, Rizzo.

479
00:33:28,238 --> 00:33:30,538
Mommy!

480
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:39,682
Hey, we're going down.

481
00:33:40,294 --> 00:33:42,730
Hang on, Rizzo.

482
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,497
[Dickens] Sorry, madam.

483
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:47,506
[Rizzo] Pardon me, sir.

484
00:33:47,574 --> 00:33:49,406
Look out, Rizzo.

485
00:33:52,517 --> 00:33:54,612
Rizzo, this is Louise.

486
00:33:54,687 --> 00:33:56,680
Yeah, we've met.

487
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:10,475
And so they arrived
in Ebenezer Scrooge's childhood.

488
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,953
That was the worst trip of my life.

489
00:34:13,022 --> 00:34:14,388
It's over now.

490
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:17,520
Yeah, safe at last.

491
00:34:18,366 --> 00:34:19,355
No.

492
00:34:20,068 --> 00:34:22,539
No. No! Oh, no!

493
00:34:22,608 --> 00:34:24,007
Nice kitty, nice kitty.

494
00:34:24,077 --> 00:34:26,104
Ow! I'm from New Jersey.

495
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:31,413
It was the afternoon of Christmas Eve,

496
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:34,791
and Scrooge was conscious
of a thousand odors.

497
00:34:34,863 --> 00:34:39,964
Each one connected with a thousand
thoughts, hopes, joys and cares,

498
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,203
long, long forgotten.

499
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:46,374
It's my old school.

500
00:34:47,321 --> 00:34:48,949
I was a boy here.

501
00:34:49,959 --> 00:34:52,589
That's Henry.

502
00:34:52,664 --> 00:34:54,930
And Edmund, my best friend.

503
00:34:55,001 --> 00:34:57,630
Hello, boys. Hello.

504
00:34:57,706 --> 00:35:00,473
These are but shadows
of your past, Ebenezer.

505
00:35:00,545 --> 00:35:03,175
They can neither see nor hear you.

506
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,584
Come, let us go inside.

507
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:09,952
Rizzo, stop playing with the cat.

508
00:35:10,029 --> 00:35:12,727
Save me, save me!

509
00:35:31,336 --> 00:35:34,775
And what a flood of memories
came back to him,

510
00:35:34,843 --> 00:35:37,974
as Scrooge beheld his old classroom.

511
00:35:39,018 --> 00:35:41,146
I know it all so well, spirit.

512
00:35:42,123 --> 00:35:43,854
The desks.

513
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:47,123
The smell of the chalk.

514
00:35:49,538 --> 00:35:51,733
I chose my profession in this room.

515
00:35:51,809 --> 00:35:54,541
And is he, too, familiar?

516
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,185
Scrooge beheld a small boy,
a boy he knew,

517
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:03,729
oh, very well indeed.

518
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,266
Good heavens.

519
00:36:09,342 --> 00:36:10,901
It's me.

520
00:36:10,979 --> 00:36:13,414
Come Ebenezer,
the last coach is leaving.

521
00:36:13,482 --> 00:36:15,782
Come on,
he never goes home for Christmas.

522
00:36:15,854 --> 00:36:18,188
Who cares about stupid old Christmas?

523
00:36:20,161 --> 00:36:22,324
I was often alone.

524
00:36:23,535 --> 00:36:27,167
More time for reading... and study.

525
00:36:27,241 --> 00:36:31,181
The Christmas holiday was a chance
to get some extra work done.

526
00:36:32,318 --> 00:36:35,085
A time for... solitude.

527
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:40,596
Rats don't understand these things.

528
00:36:40,667 --> 00:36:42,797
You were never a lonely child?

529
00:36:42,871 --> 00:36:46,310
I had 1,274 brothers and sisters.

530
00:36:46,378 --> 00:36:50,374
Sheesh.
Rats don't understand these things.

531
00:36:50,452 --> 00:36:53,983
Let us see another Christmas
in this place.

532
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:56,222
They were all very much the same.

533
00:36:58,668 --> 00:37:00,431
Nothing ever changed.

534
00:37:00,504 --> 00:37:02,599
You changed.

535
00:37:23,415 --> 00:37:26,112
The years performed
their terrible dance.

536
00:37:26,187 --> 00:37:30,354
And in a moment, Scrooge had seen
his entire childhood pass.

537
00:37:30,429 --> 00:37:34,596
He saw his old school room
age and decay.

538
00:37:34,668 --> 00:37:36,502
What the... Hey!

539
00:37:36,572 --> 00:37:37,562
Agh!

540
00:37:37,641 --> 00:37:41,513
So, Master Scrooge, graduation day!

541
00:37:42,618 --> 00:37:45,784
That's my old headmaster.

542
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:48,053
This man taught me my greatest lesson.

543
00:37:48,129 --> 00:37:51,588
Stand up. Build your life
as this school was built.

544
00:37:51,667 --> 00:37:52,727
Push!

545
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:54,796
My ear, my ear, my ear.

546
00:37:56,811 --> 00:38:01,913
Yes, work hard, work long,
and be constructive.

547
00:38:01,987 --> 00:38:04,924
Ebenezer, life is a golden opportunity.

548
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:07,931
Today you go forth into the real world.

549
00:38:07,999 --> 00:38:10,901
You must keep your nose
to the grindstone.

550
00:38:10,971 --> 00:38:13,237
Work hard, lad. And one day,

551
00:38:13,309 --> 00:38:16,304
your life will be as solid
as this very building.

552
00:38:18,252 --> 00:38:20,813
Hmm. I've been meaning
to fix that shelf.

553
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,119
Yes, headmaster.

554
00:38:22,192 --> 00:38:27,260
Young man, you have been apprenticed
to a fine company in London.

555
00:38:27,335 --> 00:38:31,298
Today, you become a man of business.

556
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:33,369
I'm looking forward to it, headmaster.

557
00:38:33,446 --> 00:38:35,883
You will love business.

558
00:38:35,952 --> 00:38:38,217
It is the American way.

559
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:39,279
Sam?

560
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,829
Mmm?

561
00:38:42,797 --> 00:38:45,463
Oh. It is the British way.

562
00:38:45,537 --> 00:38:46,526
Good.

563
00:38:46,605 --> 00:38:48,471
Yes, headmaster.

564
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,751
Oh, here is your coach, Ebenezer.

565
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:58,156
Come, Scrooge, there is much to see.

566
00:38:59,863 --> 00:39:01,856
Remember, don't tip the driver.

567
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:14,550
A moment later, Scrooge found himself
standing on a city street,

568
00:39:14,625 --> 00:39:18,724
looking at a building
he had not seen in years.

569
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,965
Tell me, Ebenezer Scrooge,
do you know this place?

570
00:39:22,038 --> 00:39:25,533
Know it? My first job was here.

571
00:39:25,612 --> 00:39:28,276
This is Fozziwig's
old rubber chicken factory.

572
00:39:28,351 --> 00:39:30,149
Once again, it was Christmas Eve,

573
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:35,288
night was falling, and the lamplighters
were plying their trade.

574
00:39:35,365 --> 00:39:38,825
Hey, light the lamp, not the rat.
Light the lamp, not the rat!

575
00:39:38,903 --> 00:39:40,668
- My apologies.
- What are you doing?

576
00:39:40,741 --> 00:39:42,974
Put me out, put me out!

577
00:39:43,045 --> 00:39:45,481
- Rizzo!
- What?

578
00:39:48,921 --> 00:39:52,122
Oh, oh, Th-th-th-thank you.

579
00:39:52,195 --> 00:39:53,926
You're welcome.

580
00:39:56,304 --> 00:39:59,036
There he is, old Fozziwig himself.

581
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:02,774
Look my lads, dusk has fallen,
and the lamplighters are at work.

582
00:40:02,849 --> 00:40:05,080
It's Christmas Eve for certain.

583
00:40:05,154 --> 00:40:07,123
What an employer he was.

584
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:10,560
As hard and as ruthless
as a rose petal.

585
00:40:10,631 --> 00:40:12,896
It's time for the party to begin.

586
00:40:12,967 --> 00:40:15,597
It's the Fozziwig Christmas party.

587
00:40:15,672 --> 00:40:17,368
Rizzo, come on.

588
00:40:18,345 --> 00:40:20,611
Rizzo, just grab hold of the stick.

589
00:40:20,683 --> 00:40:22,947
Merry Christmas.

590
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,014
Thank you, thank you.

591
00:40:26,494 --> 00:40:29,294
Excuse me, everyone.
Can we have some quiet, please?

592
00:40:32,238 --> 00:40:33,500
Whoa!

593
00:40:39,718 --> 00:40:42,417
I suppose I should be grateful for that.

594
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,357
You're welcome.

595
00:40:44,427 --> 00:40:47,628
Everyone, please,
can I have your attention for a moment?

596
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:52,003
Look, it's the Marley brothers.

597
00:40:52,076 --> 00:40:54,204
My old partners, as they were as lads.

598
00:40:54,279 --> 00:40:56,647
Can I have your attention, please?

599
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:02,224
Quiet!

600
00:41:04,298 --> 00:41:05,665
Thank you.

601
00:41:05,733 --> 00:41:07,363
That's better.

602
00:41:07,439 --> 00:41:10,740
Welcome to Fozziwig and Mom's
annual Christmas party.

603
00:41:10,811 --> 00:41:12,677
At this time in the proceedings,

604
00:41:12,748 --> 00:41:15,582
it is a tradition
for me to make a little speech.

605
00:41:15,654 --> 00:41:18,385
And it's a tradition for us
to take a little nap.

606
00:41:20,796 --> 00:41:22,924
Uh, pay no attention to them.

607
00:41:22,999 --> 00:41:26,029
My speech,
here is my Christmas speech.

608
00:41:26,106 --> 00:41:29,670
"Thank you all
and merry Christmas."

609
00:41:29,746 --> 00:41:31,840
- That was the speech?
- That was dumb.

610
00:41:31,917 --> 00:41:33,646
- It was obvious.
- It was pointless.

611
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,883
It was short.

612
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:42,832
I'm bored with speeches.
Let's dance, Son!

613
00:41:42,904 --> 00:41:45,375
Here's Mrs. Fozziwig to start the party.

614
00:41:45,443 --> 00:41:47,971
- Way to go, Ma!
- Hit it, boys!

615
00:41:51,954 --> 00:41:53,080
Hello.

616
00:41:54,694 --> 00:41:57,459
Look, there's a buffet over here.
I'm kind of hungry.

617
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:05,672
<i>Fa-la la-la la
La-la la la</i>

618
00:42:05,747 --> 00:42:09,686
Forget it. Mother always taught me,
never eat singing food.

619
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:14,496
A pleasure having you here.

620
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:17,160
I'm very pleased,
and please enjoy yourself.

621
00:42:17,236 --> 00:42:19,762
Excuse me, Mr. Fozziwig?

622
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,902
Sir, I've been going over the accounts.

623
00:42:21,979 --> 00:42:25,007
Do you know how much the firm
is spending for this party?

624
00:42:25,085 --> 00:42:28,385
Master Scrooge, this is Christmas.

625
00:42:28,456 --> 00:42:30,551
It's a time for generosity.

626
00:42:30,627 --> 00:42:36,128
Stop working, enjoy yourself.
Go meet some people, go ahead.

627
00:42:36,204 --> 00:42:37,331
Hello.

628
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:53,403
You dancing fool!

629
00:43:00,684 --> 00:43:03,087
I love these annual Christmas parties.

630
00:43:03,156 --> 00:43:05,591
I love them so much,
I think we'll do it twice a year.

631
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,958
Excuse me.

632
00:43:07,029 --> 00:43:09,832
- [Fozziwig] Master Scrooge.
- Excuse me.

633
00:43:09,901 --> 00:43:12,964
Belle, I'd like to introduce you
to Ebenezer Scrooge,

634
00:43:13,042 --> 00:43:15,443
the finest young financial mind
in the city.

635
00:43:15,512 --> 00:43:17,914
Ebenezer, this is Belle,

636
00:43:17,984 --> 00:43:19,976
a friend of the Fozziwig family.

637
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:22,047
I'm pleased to meet you.

638
00:43:23,594 --> 00:43:26,828
Well, I'm glad you two finally met.

639
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,270
Do you remember this meeting?

640
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:32,337
Remember?

641
00:43:34,448 --> 00:43:35,438
Yes.

642
00:43:36,251 --> 00:43:38,278
I remember.

643
00:43:38,355 --> 00:43:42,419
There was, of course, another
Christmas Eve with this young woman,

644
00:43:42,497 --> 00:43:44,830
some years later.

645
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:49,103
Oh, please,
do not show me that Christmas.

646
00:44:10,082 --> 00:44:12,746
Another year
before our wedding, Ebenezer.

647
00:44:12,821 --> 00:44:14,881
It can't be helped, Belle.

648
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:20,193
How could we marry now? There's
not even enough for a decent home.

649
00:44:20,268 --> 00:44:22,534
The investments haven't grown
as they should.

650
00:44:22,605 --> 00:44:24,598
So you said last year.

651
00:44:25,178 --> 00:44:27,375
Business continues to be poor.

652
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,748
You're a partner in your own firm now.

653
00:44:33,425 --> 00:44:35,224
Barely clearing expenses.

654
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:38,700
- You said the partnership was the goal.
- This is for you.

655
00:44:40,072 --> 00:44:42,564
I love you, Belle.

656
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:46,514
You did, once.

657
00:44:54,666 --> 00:44:56,396
Oh, Rizzo.

658
00:45:01,043 --> 00:45:03,014
Spirit, show me no more.

659
00:45:03,984 --> 00:45:06,352
Why do you delight in torturing me?

660
00:45:06,421 --> 00:45:10,952
I told you, these are the shadows
of the things that have been.

661
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:14,731
That they are what they are,
do not blame me.

662
00:45:14,804 --> 00:45:16,796
Leave me.

663
00:45:38,114 --> 00:45:42,384
Scrooge was left alone and exhausted
in his bedchamber.

664
00:45:42,457 --> 00:45:47,420
And thus he remained, until the
nearby clock began to strike the hour.

665
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,535
Oh.

666
00:45:49,602 --> 00:45:52,632
- Oh. Oh, what was that?
- Two o'clock.

667
00:45:52,709 --> 00:45:55,145
- Is it too early for breakfast?
- Yes.

668
00:45:55,214 --> 00:45:57,650
Oh, good, supper time.

669
00:46:02,661 --> 00:46:06,624
Scrooge knew
the second of the ghosts was due.

670
00:46:06,701 --> 00:46:09,936
Yet now,
as the clock finished striking...

671
00:46:11,512 --> 00:46:13,037
Nothing.

672
00:46:15,953 --> 00:46:18,891
Come in, and know me better, man.

673
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:36,251
Come in, and know me better, man.

674
00:46:36,324 --> 00:46:39,125
- Did I already say that?
- You did.

675
00:46:39,197 --> 00:46:41,997
I am the Ghost of Christmas Present.

676
00:46:42,069 --> 00:46:46,477
This is the night before the dawn
before the day of Christmas.

677
00:46:46,544 --> 00:46:50,484
Did I tell you that I am
the Ghost of Christmas Present?

678
00:46:50,552 --> 00:46:55,323
- You did.
- Come in, know me better, man.

679
00:46:55,394 --> 00:46:57,557
You're a little absent-minded, spirit.

680
00:46:57,631 --> 00:47:02,071
No, I'm a large
absent-minded spirit. [chuckles]

681
00:47:03,409 --> 00:47:06,348
My mind is filled
with the here and now.

682
00:47:06,414 --> 00:47:10,252
And the now is Christmas. [laughs]

683
00:47:10,322 --> 00:47:14,056
I don't believe I've
ever met anybody like you before, sir.

684
00:47:14,129 --> 00:47:18,468
Really? Over 1,800 of my brothers
have come before me.

685
00:47:18,537 --> 00:47:21,873
1,800? Lmagine the grocery bills.

686
00:47:27,354 --> 00:47:31,658
Have you ever noticed that everything
seems wonderful at Christmas?

687
00:47:33,232 --> 00:47:38,037
Uh, in all honesty, spirit, no.

688
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:42,447
Perhaps I've never understood
about Christmas.

689
00:47:42,517 --> 00:47:46,546
Before this day is done,
you will understand.

690
00:47:46,624 --> 00:47:48,593
Oh. [laughs]

691
00:47:48,661 --> 00:47:50,493
Oh, no! Oh, no!

692
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:56,137
We shall go out into the world.

693
00:47:59,013 --> 00:48:01,417
I suppose you enjoyed that?

694
00:48:01,485 --> 00:48:03,009
Of course.

695
00:48:08,097 --> 00:48:12,664
May I welcome you
to Christmas morning?

696
00:48:22,259 --> 00:48:25,197
<i>It's in the singing
of a street corner choir</i>

697
00:48:25,263 --> 00:48:27,860
<i>It's going home
and getting warm by the fire</i>

698
00:48:27,935 --> 00:48:31,031
<i>It's true wherever you find love</i>

699
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:33,601
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

700
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:36,378
<i>A cup of kindness
that we share with another</i>

701
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:39,183
<i>A sweet reunion
with a friend or a brother</i>

702
00:48:39,257 --> 00:48:42,285
<i>In all the places you find love</i>

703
00:48:42,362 --> 00:48:45,232
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

704
00:48:45,301 --> 00:48:49,742
<i>It is the season of the heart</i>

705
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:52,679
<i>A special time of caring</i>

706
00:48:52,748 --> 00:48:56,482
<i>The ways of love made clear</i>

707
00:48:56,555 --> 00:49:01,361
<i>And it is the season of the spirit</i>

708
00:49:01,432 --> 00:49:04,062
<i>The message if we hear it</i>

709
00:49:04,136 --> 00:49:07,974
<i>Is make it last all year</i>

710
00:49:13,287 --> 00:49:16,053
<i>It's in the giving of a gift
to another</i>

711
00:49:16,125 --> 00:49:18,927
<i>A pair of mittens
that were made by your mother</i>

712
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:22,094
<i>It's all the ways that we show love</i>

713
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:24,605
<i>That feel like Christmas</i>

714
00:49:24,675 --> 00:49:27,306
<i>A part of childhood
we'll always remember</i>

715
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:30,080
<i>It is the summer
of the soul in December</i>

716
00:49:30,152 --> 00:49:33,352
<i>Yes, when you do your best for love</i>

717
00:49:33,425 --> 00:49:36,626
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

718
00:49:36,699 --> 00:49:40,729
<i>It is the season of the heart</i>

719
00:49:40,805 --> 00:49:43,710
<i>A special time of caring</i>

720
00:49:43,778 --> 00:49:47,879
<i>The ways of love made clear</i>

721
00:49:47,952 --> 00:49:51,915
<i>It is the season of the spirit</i>

722
00:49:51,994 --> 00:49:54,830
<i>The message, if we hear it</i>

723
00:49:54,899 --> 00:49:58,771
<i>Is make it last all year</i>

724
00:50:04,049 --> 00:50:06,953
<i>It's in the singing
of a street corner choir</i>

725
00:50:07,022 --> 00:50:09,754
<i>It's going home
and getting warm by the fire</i>

726
00:50:09,827 --> 00:50:13,027
<i>It's true wherever you find love</i>

727
00:50:13,099 --> 00:50:15,433
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

728
00:50:15,505 --> 00:50:22,245
<i>It's true wherever you find love</i>

729
00:50:22,317 --> 00:50:26,348
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

730
00:50:29,763 --> 00:50:35,072
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

731
00:50:35,141 --> 00:50:39,547
It feels like Christmas!

732
00:50:41,219 --> 00:50:47,995
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

733
00:50:51,104 --> 00:50:52,802
Spirit, I had no idea.

734
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:56,906
I wish to see friends, kin.
Show me family.

735
00:50:59,086 --> 00:51:03,049
It's Fred. My dear nephew Fred
and his wife, Clara.

736
00:51:03,129 --> 00:51:05,063
Having Christmas with friends.

737
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:07,591
Hey, look. Fruit.

738
00:51:07,669 --> 00:51:10,767
Well, now, we've had the plum pudding
and sung the carols.

739
00:51:10,843 --> 00:51:12,834
- What now, my lovelies?
- A game, Fred.

740
00:51:12,914 --> 00:51:15,076
Yeah, we must have a game at Christmas.

741
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:18,645
- Do people play games at Christmas?
- I love games.

742
00:51:18,724 --> 00:51:21,389
Say, do you know that fruit is wax?

743
00:51:21,463 --> 00:51:24,902
Oh, yeah,
I wondered about the texture. Yeuch!

744
00:51:24,969 --> 00:51:28,099
- Let's play "Yes and No."
- Oh, wonderful game.

745
00:51:28,174 --> 00:51:31,238
Yah! That's a great game. I'll be it.

746
00:51:31,315 --> 00:51:34,080
Yes, let Fred be it.
He always thinks of good things.

747
00:51:34,152 --> 00:51:36,554
I do have a good one, Clara. Guess.

748
00:51:36,624 --> 00:51:38,618
Is it vegetable?

749
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:40,221
- [Fred] No.
- [Clara] Mineral?

750
00:51:40,298 --> 00:51:41,698
- No.
- Animal, then?

751
00:51:41,767 --> 00:51:43,669
- What else?
- What else, indeed.

752
00:51:43,738 --> 00:51:45,970
- Is it found on a farm?
- Never.

753
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:47,738
- In the city?
- Usually.

754
00:51:47,811 --> 00:51:50,044
Does it pull a hansom cab?

755
00:51:50,116 --> 00:51:51,643
Certainly not.

756
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:53,450
How about a dog?

757
00:51:53,523 --> 00:51:54,513
No.

758
00:51:54,591 --> 00:51:55,718
- A cat?
- A cat?

759
00:51:55,793 --> 00:51:59,131
- I said it first.
- No.

760
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,762
Wait, is this an unwanted creature?

761
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:04,035
- Often.
- A mouse?

762
00:52:04,109 --> 00:52:05,337
- No.
- A rat?

763
00:52:05,412 --> 00:52:07,507
- You called?
- A cockroach.

764
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:08,573
No.

765
00:52:08,652 --> 00:52:10,177
- A leech?
- It's too wonderful.

766
00:52:10,254 --> 00:52:13,249
Wait, I know.
An unwanted creature,

767
00:52:13,326 --> 00:52:15,795
but not a rat, a leech,
or a cockroach?

768
00:52:15,864 --> 00:52:16,924
Then what?

769
00:52:17,001 --> 00:52:19,334
- What?
- It's Ebenezer Scrooge.

770
00:52:19,405 --> 00:52:20,395
Yes.

771
00:52:20,474 --> 00:52:22,740
Wonderful.

772
00:52:23,813 --> 00:52:26,512
That's a killer.

773
00:52:33,764 --> 00:52:36,738
Come, there is much to see.

774
00:52:36,805 --> 00:52:39,777
No more. I wish to see no more.

775
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,589
Here.

776
00:52:46,656 --> 00:52:48,956
Why have we come
to this odd corner of the town?

777
00:52:49,027 --> 00:52:51,691
It's Christmas here, too, you know.

778
00:52:51,767 --> 00:52:54,465
That's Bob Cratchit's house.

779
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:57,271
Perhaps it was the spirit's
own generous nature,

780
00:52:57,344 --> 00:52:59,472
and his sympathy for all poor men,

781
00:52:59,548 --> 00:53:03,817
that led them straight to the home
of Scrooge's faithful clerk.

782
00:53:05,759 --> 00:53:08,457
Goose. They're cooking goose down there.

783
00:53:10,034 --> 00:53:12,663
Rizzo, get out of the way.

784
00:53:12,739 --> 00:53:14,936
Hey, don't be sweeping
the chimney now.

785
00:53:15,011 --> 00:53:17,037
You're blocking the smell. [sniffs]

786
00:53:18,248 --> 00:53:21,653
- This is Bob Cratchit's house?
- How do you know that?

787
00:53:21,721 --> 00:53:23,817
You just told me.

788
00:53:23,893 --> 00:53:26,865
Hmm. Well, I'm usually trustworthy.

789
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:34,112
- Who's that?
- Mrs. Cratchit, of course.

790
00:53:37,319 --> 00:53:38,878
Ahh!

791
00:53:41,394 --> 00:53:44,455
Peter, do not stop turning that spit.

792
00:53:44,533 --> 00:53:47,731
That is the whole secret
of a properly roasted goose.

793
00:53:47,805 --> 00:53:52,213
- It smells so good, Mother.
- It does, doesn't it?

794
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,548
Oh. That smells wonderful.

795
00:53:56,655 --> 00:53:58,089
Oh, good grief.

796
00:53:58,157 --> 00:54:00,287
Hey, I'm stuck, get me out of here.

797
00:54:00,363 --> 00:54:02,492
I knew you weren't suited
for literature.

798
00:54:06,774 --> 00:54:09,210
Oh, at least I landed
on something soft.

799
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:11,341
And hot! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

800
00:54:11,416 --> 00:54:13,716
Hot, hot, hot!

801
00:54:14,554 --> 00:54:16,718
Mother, Mother, Mother!

802
00:54:16,793 --> 00:54:21,894
You said we couldn't eat the chestnuts
until Father and Tiny Tim get home.

803
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:24,064
I wasn't eating them,

804
00:54:24,141 --> 00:54:27,738
I was merely checking them
to see if they were not burnt.

805
00:54:27,813 --> 00:54:30,786
It's a chef's thing, dear.
And do not shout, Betina.

806
00:54:30,852 --> 00:54:33,882
- I'm Belinda.
- I'm Betina.

807
00:54:33,959 --> 00:54:36,327
Of course you are, Betina.

808
00:54:36,396 --> 00:54:37,922
Belinda.

809
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:40,799
Whatever.

810
00:54:42,108 --> 00:54:44,544
Huh?

811
00:54:50,123 --> 00:54:54,586
<i>'Tis the season
to be jolly and joyous, fa la la</i>

812
00:54:54,665 --> 00:54:59,767
<i>With a burst of pleasure
we feel it arrive, fa la la</i>

813
00:54:59,841 --> 00:55:04,647
<i>It's a season when the saints
can employ us, fa la la</i>

814
00:55:04,716 --> 00:55:08,349
<i>To spread the news about
peace and to keep love alive</i>

815
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:14,097
Come on, son.

816
00:55:14,168 --> 00:55:16,604
Let's go see if Christmas dinner
is ready yet.

817
00:55:16,672 --> 00:55:18,768
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes.

818
00:55:22,817 --> 00:55:25,118
Merry Christmas, everyone.

819
00:55:25,189 --> 00:55:26,316
Daddy!

820
00:55:29,596 --> 00:55:30,929
Merry Christmas, girls.

821
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,197
- Merry Christmas, Peter.
- Merry Christmas.

822
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:35,936
Children, children,
it's time to set the table.

823
00:55:36,009 --> 00:55:38,845
- Go ahead.
- Wait for me.

824
00:55:38,916 --> 00:55:42,353
- Merry Christmas, Emily.
- Merry Christmas...

825
00:55:42,421 --> 00:55:43,753
Crachy.

826
00:55:44,525 --> 00:55:45,515
Emmy.

827
00:55:49,902 --> 00:55:54,206
I fell down the chimney
and landed on a flaming hot goose.

828
00:55:54,278 --> 00:55:57,112
You have all the fun.

829
00:55:57,182 --> 00:55:59,209
What?

830
00:55:59,286 --> 00:56:01,916
Peter, the Christmas dinner.

831
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:03,928
The goose, the goose.

832
00:56:07,401 --> 00:56:11,273
Oh, no, now, son,
you've gotten too excited.

833
00:56:11,342 --> 00:56:15,578
You go sit in your chair a moment.
Rest a moment.

834
00:56:15,651 --> 00:56:19,487
- How was he at church?
- As good as gold and better.

835
00:56:19,558 --> 00:56:21,722
He said he hoped the people
saw him in church

836
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:25,325
because it might be pleasant for them
to remember upon Christmas Day

837
00:56:25,402 --> 00:56:29,502
who made lame beggars walk
and blind men see.

838
00:56:29,576 --> 00:56:31,570
A remarkable child.

839
00:56:33,051 --> 00:56:35,953
With that,
the Cratchits came to what was surely

840
00:56:36,023 --> 00:56:40,122
the happiest single moment
in all the livelong year.

841
00:56:40,197 --> 00:56:44,001
- Such a meager feast.
- But very much appreciated.

842
00:56:45,874 --> 00:56:48,141
I pay Bob such a small amount.

843
00:56:48,212 --> 00:56:50,707
- Mr. Scrooge.
- Bob.

844
00:56:50,784 --> 00:56:52,880
Bob Cratchit?

845
00:56:52,955 --> 00:56:55,926
It only seems right that
I should lift a glass to my employer.

846
00:56:55,994 --> 00:56:58,794
I give you Mr. Scrooge,
the founder of the feast.

847
00:56:58,865 --> 00:57:02,133
The founder of the feast, indeed. Huh!

848
00:57:02,205 --> 00:57:06,076
If I had him here, I would give him
a piece of my mind to feast upon.

849
00:57:06,145 --> 00:57:08,080
And I bet he would choke on it.

850
00:57:08,149 --> 00:57:10,620
- Choke!
- My dear, the children.

851
00:57:10,688 --> 00:57:11,917
Christmas Day.

852
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:16,454
Well, I suppose that
on the blessed day of Christmas,

853
00:57:16,532 --> 00:57:20,164
one must drink to the health
of Mr. Scrooge,

854
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:23,507
even though he is odious,
stingy, wicked,

855
00:57:23,579 --> 00:57:27,382
and unfeeling, and badly dressed...

856
00:57:27,453 --> 00:57:30,913
To the founder of the feast,
Mr. Scrooge.

857
00:57:30,992 --> 00:57:37,268
To Mr. Scrooge, he'll be very merry
and happy this day, I have no doubt.

858
00:57:37,339 --> 00:57:38,329
No doubt.

859
00:57:38,407 --> 00:57:39,706
Mm. Cheers.

860
00:57:41,246 --> 00:57:45,117
God bless us, every one.

861
00:57:47,325 --> 00:57:50,296
<i>Life is full of sweet surprises</i>

862
00:57:50,363 --> 00:57:52,662
<i>Every day's a gift</i>

863
00:57:52,734 --> 00:57:55,603
<i>The sun comes up
And I can feel it</i>

864
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:58,304

00:57:58,378 --> 00:58:03,719
<i>Fills me up with laughter
Fills me up with song</i>

866
00:58:03,787 --> 00:58:06,658
<i>I look into the eyes of love</i>

867
00:58:06,728 --> 00:58:09,961
<i>And know that I belong</i>

868
00:58:10,033 --> 00:58:12,697
<i>Bless us all</i>

869
00:58:12,771 --> 00:58:15,538
<i>Who gather here</i>

870
00:58:15,611 --> 00:58:21,110
<i>The loving family I hold dear</i>

871
00:58:21,187 --> 00:58:23,885
<i>No place on Earth</i>

872
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:26,727
<i>Compares with home</i>

873
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:32,104
<i>And every path will bring me
back from where I roam</i>

874
00:58:32,877 --> 00:58:35,109
<i>Bless us all</i>

875
00:58:35,181 --> 00:58:37,707
<i>That as we live</i>

876
00:58:37,786 --> 00:58:43,628
<i>We always comfort and forgive</i>

877
00:58:43,696 --> 00:58:45,962
<i>We have so much</i>

878
00:58:46,034 --> 00:58:48,938
<i>That we can share</i>

879
00:58:49,008 --> 00:58:54,245
<i>With those in need
we see around us everywhere</i>

880
00:58:54,318 --> 00:58:58,654
<i>Let us always love each other</i>

881
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:03,229
<i>Lead us to the light</i>

882
00:59:05,805 --> 00:59:11,145
<i>Let us hear the voice of reason</i>

883
00:59:11,216 --> 00:59:14,244
<i>Singing in the night</i>

884
00:59:16,658 --> 00:59:20,097
<i>Let us run from anger</i>

885
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:26,100
<i>And catch us when we fall</i>

886
00:59:27,946 --> 00:59:33,116
<i>Teach us in our dreams
And please, yes, please,</i>

887
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:36,525
<i>Bless us, one and all</i>

888
00:59:39,969 --> 00:59:42,166
<i>Bless us all</i>

889
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,711
<i>With playful years</i>

890
00:59:44,778 --> 00:59:50,313
<i>With noisy games and joyful tears</i>

891
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:53,293
<i>We reach for you</i>

892
00:59:53,361 --> 00:59:56,333
<i>And we stand tall</i>

893
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:01,969
<i>And in our prayers and dreams
We ask you, bless us all</i>

894
01:00:02,045 --> 01:00:04,709
<i>We reach for you</i>

895
01:00:04,783 --> 01:00:08,587
<i>And we stand tall</i>

896
01:00:08,657 --> 01:00:13,098
<i>And in our prayers and dreams,
we ask you</i>

897
01:00:13,166 --> 01:00:17,196
<i>Bless us all</i>

898
01:00:23,485 --> 01:00:26,947
Let's all take our seats now.
Let's have dinner.

899
01:00:27,025 --> 01:00:31,193
Spirit, tell me if Tiny Tim will live.

900
01:00:31,265 --> 01:00:33,327
That is the future.

901
01:00:33,403 --> 01:00:35,396
My realm is the present.

902
01:00:35,474 --> 01:00:40,850
However, I see a vacant seat
by the chimney corner.

903
01:00:40,916 --> 01:00:43,252
And a crutch without an owner.

904
01:00:43,322 --> 01:00:48,823
If these shadows remain unaltered,
I believe the child will die.

905
01:00:48,899 --> 01:00:52,361
But then, if he's going to die,
he'd better do it,

906
01:00:52,439 --> 01:00:55,708
and decrease the surplus population.

907
01:00:55,781 --> 01:00:57,180
Oh, spirit.

908
01:00:57,250 --> 01:01:00,380
As the Cratchit family
vanished into the darkness,

909
01:01:00,455 --> 01:01:04,724
Scrooge kept his eyes upon Tiny Tim,
until the last.

910
01:01:04,797 --> 01:01:08,360
Come. My time grows short.

911
01:01:15,249 --> 01:01:17,185
Spirit, do you grow old?

912
01:01:17,253 --> 01:01:19,814
I do. [chuckles]

913
01:01:22,062 --> 01:01:24,329
Are spirits' lives so short?

914
01:01:24,401 --> 01:01:27,395
My time upon this globe is very brief.

915
01:01:27,473 --> 01:01:33,714
I believe it will end
upon the stroke of 12.

916
01:01:33,785 --> 01:01:35,652
[Rizzo] One.

917
01:01:35,721 --> 01:01:40,491
Now? But spirit,
I have learned so much from you.

918
01:01:40,596 --> 01:01:43,399
Nothing Scrooge could do or say
could stop

919
01:01:43,468 --> 01:01:46,669
the relentless march
of those terrible bells.

920
01:01:46,741 --> 01:01:48,735
Five!

921
01:01:48,813 --> 01:01:51,146
Oh, spirit, do not leave me.

922
01:01:51,216 --> 01:01:54,017
I think I must, in fact.

923
01:01:54,123 --> 01:01:57,185
You have meant so much to me.
You have changed me.

924
01:01:57,295 --> 01:02:02,635
And now I leave you with
the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come.

925
01:02:02,705 --> 01:02:06,110
- You mean, the future?
- Mm.

926
01:02:06,179 --> 01:02:07,238
Must I?

927
01:02:07,314 --> 01:02:13,087
Go forth, and know him better, man.

928
01:02:55,572 --> 01:02:59,603
Am I in the presence of the
Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come?

929
01:03:03,453 --> 01:03:09,887
Spirit, I fear you more
than any specter I have yet met.

930
01:03:11,302 --> 01:03:14,468
This is too scary.
I don't think I want to see any more.

931
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:17,809
When you're right, you're right.
You're on your own, folks.

932
01:03:17,882 --> 01:03:21,718
- We'll meet you at the finale.
- Yeah.

933
01:03:22,589 --> 01:03:27,327
I am prepared to follow and to learn,
with a thankful heart.

934
01:03:30,671 --> 01:03:33,142
Will you not speak to me?

935
01:03:37,452 --> 01:03:41,516
Oh, yes, the night is waning fast.

936
01:03:41,592 --> 01:03:43,585
Lead on, spirit.

937
01:04:06,939 --> 01:04:09,671
No, I don't know much about it,
either way.

938
01:04:09,744 --> 01:04:12,443
I only know he's dead.

939
01:04:12,516 --> 01:04:15,684
- When?
- Last night, I believe.

940
01:04:15,757 --> 01:04:19,058
Wonder what he died of.
I thought he'd never go.

941
01:04:20,566 --> 01:04:22,762
I don't know or care why he's gone.

942
01:04:22,835 --> 01:04:25,272
I'd just like to know
what he's done with his money.

943
01:04:25,341 --> 01:04:26,866
Wouldn't we all?

944
01:04:26,944 --> 01:04:28,708
He didn't give it to me.

945
01:04:30,084 --> 01:04:32,681
It's likely to be a cheap funeral.

946
01:04:32,756 --> 01:04:35,590
I don't know a single soul
who would go to it.

947
01:04:35,661 --> 01:04:37,995
- I wouldn't mind going.
- Eh?

948
01:04:38,065 --> 01:04:40,297
If lunch is provided.

949
01:04:42,574 --> 01:04:44,909
- Speaking of lunch...
- Oh, yes.

950
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:51,052
I know some of those gentlemen, spirit.

951
01:04:51,123 --> 01:04:54,153
Of what poor wretch do they speak?

952
01:05:09,625 --> 01:05:13,656
So, back from the house of sadness,
I see.

953
01:05:13,732 --> 01:05:17,262
Sad that he didn't die years ago,
the old skinflint.

954
01:05:17,339 --> 01:05:19,468
- Hear, hear.
- Let me see.

955
01:05:19,544 --> 01:05:21,844
What have you got for old Joe?

956
01:05:21,915 --> 01:05:25,718
What have you got for me
to remember him by?

957
01:05:25,788 --> 01:05:27,586
Joe, get off.

958
01:05:27,658 --> 01:05:31,655
Well, I got these collar buttons
from his dresser.

959
01:05:32,734 --> 01:05:34,967
Mother of pearl.

960
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:37,806
No, I got his bed curtains.

961
01:05:37,877 --> 01:05:40,941
Very fine damask. [laughs]

962
01:05:41,017 --> 01:05:44,820
Very cheap damask.
But worth a few coins.

963
01:05:44,892 --> 01:05:47,123
I've got his blankets.

964
01:05:47,196 --> 01:05:52,729
His blankets?
Why, Mrs. Dilber, they're still warm.

965
01:05:52,806 --> 01:05:56,404
I don't pay extra for the warmth,
you know.

966
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,508
You should.
It's the only warmth he ever had.

967
01:06:06,899 --> 01:06:08,527
I understand, spirit.

968
01:06:08,602 --> 01:06:11,972
The case of this unhappy man
might be my own.

969
01:06:12,042 --> 01:06:14,706
My life turns that way now.

970
01:06:14,781 --> 01:06:16,774
Merciful heavens.

971
01:06:17,754 --> 01:06:21,283
Let me see some tenderness
connected with this world,

972
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:24,729
or I'll be haunted
by that terrible conversation forever.

973
01:06:32,348 --> 01:06:35,183
It's Bob Cratchit's house.

974
01:06:35,254 --> 01:06:37,690
Oh, yes, spirit.

975
01:06:37,757 --> 01:06:39,750
A place of joy and laughter.

976
01:06:40,697 --> 01:06:43,224
Thank you for bringing me here.

977
01:06:48,777 --> 01:06:51,077
It's so quiet.

978
01:06:53,454 --> 01:06:55,823
Why is it so quiet, spirit?

979
01:07:12,891 --> 01:07:14,724
Mother, you're crying again.

980
01:07:14,795 --> 01:07:18,233
It's just the lamplight,
that hurts my eyes.

981
01:07:22,776 --> 01:07:24,769
Not Tiny Tim?

982
01:07:26,249 --> 01:07:30,655
There, now.
My eyes get weak in the dim light.

983
01:07:30,724 --> 01:07:34,095
I would not want to show
weak eyes to your father,

984
01:07:34,165 --> 01:07:36,431
when he gets home,
for anything in the world.

985
01:07:36,502 --> 01:07:39,336
He should be back now.

986
01:07:39,407 --> 01:07:44,246
I think he's walked a little slower
these past two evenings.

987
01:07:45,318 --> 01:07:47,447
Hello, my dears.

988
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:48,649
Daddy.

989
01:07:51,097 --> 01:07:52,860
Hello, girls.

990
01:07:52,933 --> 01:07:53,993
Hello, Peter.

991
01:07:54,068 --> 01:07:57,404
Children, please go set the table.

992
01:07:57,475 --> 01:07:59,341
Thank you.

993
01:07:59,412 --> 01:08:01,005
How was the churchyard?

994
01:08:01,082 --> 01:08:02,676
It will be lovely, Emily.

995
01:08:02,751 --> 01:08:06,850
It would have done you good
to see how green the place is.

996
01:08:06,925 --> 01:08:11,765
I picked a spot for Tim
where he can see...

997
01:08:11,835 --> 01:08:14,671
It's, it's a spot on the hill.

998
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:17,211
You can see the ducks on the river.

999
01:08:17,278 --> 01:08:18,507
Tiny Tim...

1000
01:08:18,581 --> 01:08:22,385
Tiny Tim always loved
watching the ducks on the river.

1001
01:08:25,629 --> 01:08:30,969
Spirit, must there be a Christmas
that brings this awful scene?

1002
01:08:32,941 --> 01:08:34,935
How can we endure it?

1003
01:08:37,785 --> 01:08:40,050
It's all right, children.

1004
01:08:41,257 --> 01:08:43,625
Life is made up
of meetings and partings.

1005
01:08:43,695 --> 01:08:45,527
That is the way of it.

1006
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:49,832
I am sure we shall never forget
Tiny Tim.

1007
01:08:49,907 --> 01:08:52,707
Or this first parting
that there was among us.

1008
01:09:29,315 --> 01:09:31,478
Must we return to this place?

1009
01:09:35,027 --> 01:09:37,189
There is something else
that I must know?

1010
01:09:37,262 --> 01:09:39,790
Is that not true?

1011
01:09:41,370 --> 01:09:44,741
Spirit, I know what I must ask.

1012
01:09:44,811 --> 01:09:47,248
I fear to, but I must.

1013
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:50,214
Who was the wretched man

1014
01:09:50,288 --> 01:09:53,158
whose death brought
so much glee and happiness to others?

1015
01:10:06,217 --> 01:10:08,153
Answer me one more question.

1016
01:10:08,221 --> 01:10:10,691
Are these the shadows
of things that will be?

1017
01:10:10,759 --> 01:10:13,425
Or are they the shadows
of things that may be, only?

1018
01:10:22,916 --> 01:10:25,250
These events can be changed.

1019
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:39,944
A life can be made right.

1020
01:11:00,855 --> 01:11:02,984
Ebenezer Scrooge.

1021
01:11:03,058 --> 01:11:05,893
Oh, please, spirit, no.

1022
01:11:05,964 --> 01:11:08,491
Hear me, I'm not the man I was.

1023
01:11:10,271 --> 01:11:13,608
Why would you show me this
if I was past all hope?

1024
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:19,221
I will honor Christmas,
and try to keep it all the year.

1025
01:11:21,794 --> 01:11:26,200
I will live my life in the past,
the present, and the future.

1026
01:11:26,269 --> 01:11:30,039
I will not shut out the lessons
the spirits have taught me.

1027
01:11:30,109 --> 01:11:33,446
Tell me that I may sponge out
the writing on this stone.

1028
01:11:36,154 --> 01:11:38,887
Spirit, please speak to me.

1029
01:11:57,962 --> 01:11:59,625
I'm home.

1030
01:12:03,204 --> 01:12:05,231
Yes, the bedposts were his own.

1031
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:08,611
The bed was his own.
The room was his own.

1032
01:12:08,683 --> 01:12:10,914
Hi, guys, we're back.

1033
01:12:10,986 --> 01:12:12,956
We promised we would be.

1034
01:12:13,024 --> 01:12:15,517
But the thing that made Scrooge
happiest of all

1035
01:12:15,595 --> 01:12:17,587
was that his life lay before him.

1036
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:19,760
And it could be changed.

1037
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:23,275
I will live my life in the past,
the present, and the future.

1038
01:12:23,344 --> 01:12:25,870
Oh, Jacob and Robert Marley.

1039
01:12:25,949 --> 01:12:28,544
Heaven in the Christmas time
be praised for this day.

1040
01:12:28,618 --> 01:12:30,782
I say it on my knees,
Jacob and Robert.

1041
01:12:30,857 --> 01:12:32,120
On my knees.

1042
01:12:32,194 --> 01:12:35,724
Oh, they're not torn down.
They're here.

1043
01:12:35,799 --> 01:12:38,429
And I'm here. It's a miracle.

1044
01:12:43,548 --> 01:12:46,177
I don't know what to do.
I'm as light as a feather.

1045
01:12:46,253 --> 01:12:49,588
I'm as happy as an angel,
I'm as merry as a schoolboy.

1046
01:12:49,659 --> 01:12:52,391
Do you think it's safe
for us to be up here?

1047
01:12:52,465 --> 01:12:54,492
Scrooge is saved,
what can happen now?

1048
01:12:54,569 --> 01:12:55,729
Yeah.

1049
01:12:59,477 --> 01:13:01,378
You there, boy.

1050
01:13:01,448 --> 01:13:02,974
What, me?

1051
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:06,354
Uh, that is, "What, me, sir?"

1052
01:13:06,424 --> 01:13:08,758
- What's today?
- Pardon?

1053
01:13:08,829 --> 01:13:10,889
What's today, my fine fellow?

1054
01:13:10,966 --> 01:13:13,665
Today? Today is Christmas Day.

1055
01:13:13,738 --> 01:13:15,264
It's Christmas Day?

1056
01:13:15,341 --> 01:13:18,575
I haven't missed it.
The spirits did it all in one night.

1057
01:13:18,647 --> 01:13:21,711
They can do anything they like.
Of course they can.

1058
01:13:21,786 --> 01:13:24,256
- Of course they can.
- Of course they can.

1059
01:13:24,325 --> 01:13:26,157
Know the poultry shop nearby?

1060
01:13:26,228 --> 01:13:28,596
- Yes, sir, I do.
- An intelligent lad.

1061
01:13:28,667 --> 01:13:31,160
A remarkable lad.

1062
01:13:31,238 --> 01:13:34,335
Do you know whether the prize turkey
has been sold in the window?

1063
01:13:34,411 --> 01:13:37,507
The one twice as big as me?
It's still there.

1064
01:13:37,582 --> 01:13:39,646
It's a pleasure talking with you, lad.

1065
01:13:39,721 --> 01:13:42,156
- Go and buy it.
- Be serious.

1066
01:13:42,226 --> 01:13:45,322
I am serious. Buy it for me
and I'll give you a shilling.

1067
01:13:45,397 --> 01:13:47,731
No, I'll give you five shillings.

1068
01:13:49,707 --> 01:13:50,936
Wow!

1069
01:13:51,008 --> 01:13:53,809
And so the boy was off like a shot.
So even...

1070
01:13:55,450 --> 01:13:57,248
Um... Sorry.

1071
01:13:58,422 --> 01:14:00,551
I'll bring it to Bob Cratchit's house.

1072
01:14:00,627 --> 01:14:04,498
What a surprise it'll be.
It's twice the size of Tiny Tim.

1073
01:14:04,567 --> 01:14:07,972
And a few moments later,
dressed in his finest,

1074
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,602
Scrooge appeared
on the streets of the city

1075
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:14,482
to wish Merry Christmas
to all the world.

1076
01:14:14,552 --> 01:14:16,648
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1077
01:14:16,722 --> 01:14:18,659
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1078
01:14:18,728 --> 01:14:21,027
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

1079
01:14:22,902 --> 01:14:24,700
Gee, thanks.

1080
01:14:24,771 --> 01:14:28,371
Everyone was out and about
this fine morning.

1081
01:14:28,446 --> 01:14:31,816
And soon he encountered
two familiar faces.

1082
01:14:33,454 --> 01:14:35,014
Mr. Scrooge.

1083
01:14:35,091 --> 01:14:37,688
Pardon me, gentlemen,
but about the charity donation

1084
01:14:37,763 --> 01:14:39,561
you asked me for yesterday?

1085
01:14:39,634 --> 01:14:41,193
Put me down for...

1086
01:14:43,541 --> 01:14:44,668
That much?

1087
01:14:44,742 --> 01:14:46,577
Not a penny less.

1088
01:14:46,646 --> 01:14:49,642
A great many back payments
are included in it, I assure you.

1089
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:52,555
My goodness,
I don't know what to say.

1090
01:14:52,624 --> 01:14:55,619
I just wish there was something
we could give you.

1091
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:03,138
A gift?

1092
01:15:03,211 --> 01:15:05,306
A gift for me?

1093
01:15:12,929 --> 01:15:14,456
Thank you.

1094
01:15:15,167 --> 01:15:16,362
Thank you.

1095
01:15:16,436 --> 01:15:20,638
- 50 times! And a Merry Christmas.
- Here's your turkey, Mr. Scrooge.

1096
01:15:20,711 --> 01:15:22,703
Follow me, lad.

1097
01:15:24,351 --> 01:15:26,844
<i>With a thankful heart,
with an endless joy</i>

1098
01:15:26,923 --> 01:15:29,393
<i>With a growing family
Every girl and boy</i>

1099
01:15:29,461 --> 01:15:31,930
<i>Will be nephew and niece to me</i>

1100
01:15:31,999 --> 01:15:34,197
<i>Nephew and niece to me</i>

1101
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:37,140
<i>Will bring love, hope,
and peace to me</i>

1102
01:15:37,208 --> 01:15:39,337
<i>Love, hope, and peace to me</i>

1103
01:15:39,413 --> 01:15:41,608
<i>Yes, and every night will end</i>

1104
01:15:41,683 --> 01:15:43,985
<i>And every day will start</i>

1105
01:15:44,055 --> 01:15:48,996
<i>With a grateful prayer
and a thankful heart</i>

1106
01:15:49,064 --> 01:15:51,557
<i>With an open smile
and with open doors</i>

1107
01:15:51,634 --> 01:15:54,072
<i>I will bid you welcome
What is mine is yours</i>

1108
01:15:54,141 --> 01:15:56,576
<i>With a glass raised
to toast your health</i>

1109
01:15:56,645 --> 01:15:59,172
<i>With a glass raised
to toast your health</i>

1110
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:01,686
<i>And a promise to share the wealth</i>

1111
01:16:01,756 --> 01:16:04,021
<i>A promise to share the wealth</i>

1112
01:16:04,093 --> 01:16:06,255
<i>I will sail a friendly course</i>

1113
01:16:06,330 --> 01:16:08,631
<i>Follow a friendly chart</i>

1114
01:16:08,702 --> 01:16:13,040
<i>On a sea of love
and a thankful heart</i>

1115
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:15,512
<i>Life is like a journey</i>

1116
01:16:17,685 --> 01:16:20,052
<i>Who knows when it ends?</i>

1117
01:16:23,462 --> 01:16:25,956
<i>Yes, and if you need to know</i>

1118
01:16:26,034 --> 01:16:28,470
<i>The measure of a man</i>

1119
01:16:28,539 --> 01:16:32,673
<i>You simply count his friends</i>

1120
01:16:32,746 --> 01:16:36,116
<i>Stop and look around you</i>

1121
01:16:37,289 --> 01:16:40,955
<i>The glory that you see</i>

1122
01:16:43,433 --> 01:16:48,170
<i>Is born again each day
Don't let it slip away</i>

1123
01:16:48,242 --> 01:16:52,080
<i>How precious life can be</i>

1124
01:17:38,169 --> 01:17:40,664
<i>With a thankful heart
that is wide awake</i>

1125
01:17:40,741 --> 01:17:43,143
<i>I do make this promise,
every breath I take</i>

1126
01:17:43,213 --> 01:17:45,945
<i>Will be used now to sing your praise</i>

1127
01:17:46,018 --> 01:17:48,215
<i>Used now to sing your praise</i>

1128
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:50,851
<i>And to beg you to share my days</i>

1129
01:17:50,927 --> 01:17:53,227
<i>Beg you to share my days</i>

1130
01:17:53,299 --> 01:17:55,495
<i>With a loving guarantee</i>

1131
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:57,938
<i>That even if we part</i>

1132
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:01,537
<i>I will hold you close
in a thankful heart</i>

1133
01:18:02,917 --> 01:18:08,258
<i>I will hold you close
in a thankful heart</i>

1134
01:18:31,103 --> 01:18:33,198
Bob Cratchit?

1135
01:18:35,913 --> 01:18:37,279
So, here you are.

1136
01:18:37,349 --> 01:18:39,375
M-M-M-Mr. Scrooge.

1137
01:18:39,752 --> 01:18:42,953
You, sir, were not at work this morning
as we had discussed.

1138
01:18:43,026 --> 01:18:45,826
But, Mr. Scrooge, sir,
we did discuss it.

1139
01:18:45,899 --> 01:18:48,163
It's Christmas Day.
You gave me the day off.

1140
01:18:48,235 --> 01:18:49,328
I?

1141
01:18:49,403 --> 01:18:51,875
I, Ebenezer Scrooge?

1142
01:18:51,943 --> 01:18:53,809
- Would I do a thing like that?
- No.

1143
01:18:53,879 --> 01:18:55,644
I mean, yes, but you did.

1144
01:18:55,717 --> 01:18:57,686
Bob Cratchit, I've had my fill of this.

1145
01:18:57,754 --> 01:19:00,521
And I have had my fill of you,
Mr. Scrooge.

1146
01:19:00,593 --> 01:19:02,152
And therefore, Bob Cratchit...

1147
01:19:02,229 --> 01:19:04,631
And therefore,
you can leave this house at once.

1148
01:19:04,701 --> 01:19:07,067
And therefore,
I'm about to raise your salary.

1149
01:19:07,138 --> 01:19:10,976
And I am about to raise you
right off the pavement...

1150
01:19:11,046 --> 01:19:12,138
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

1151
01:19:12,215 --> 01:19:13,683
Yes, Bob.

1152
01:19:13,751 --> 01:19:15,414
Raise your salary.

1153
01:19:15,487 --> 01:19:18,425
And pay your mortgage
on this house.

1154
01:19:20,263 --> 01:19:22,164
Please, sir, come inside.

1155
01:19:22,234 --> 01:19:23,497
Yes, yes.

1156
01:19:23,569 --> 01:19:26,904
Bob Cratchit, would you and your family
care to join us

1157
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:30,608
for a little turkey dinner
on this fine Christmas Day?

1158
01:19:30,682 --> 01:19:32,675
Merry Christmas.

1159
01:19:42,806 --> 01:19:45,242
And Scrooge
was better than his word.

1160
01:19:45,310 --> 01:19:48,043
He did it all, and infinitely more.

1161
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:50,017
And, er, Tiny Tim?

1162
01:19:50,085 --> 01:19:51,644
And Tiny Tim,

1163
01:19:51,723 --> 01:19:53,351
who did not die...

1164
01:19:53,425 --> 01:19:54,951
Isn't that swell?

1165
01:19:55,029 --> 01:19:58,297
To Tiny Tim,
Scrooge became a second father.

1166
01:19:58,367 --> 01:20:01,032
He became as good a friend,
as good a master,

1167
01:20:01,107 --> 01:20:04,875
and as good a man
as the good old city ever had.

1168
01:20:04,947 --> 01:20:08,010
It was always said of him that
he knew how to keep Christmas well,

1169
01:20:08,086 --> 01:20:10,454
if any man alive
possessed the knowledge.

1170
01:20:10,524 --> 01:20:14,760
May that truly be said of us
and all of us.

1171
01:20:14,831 --> 01:20:17,360
And so, as Tiny Tim observed...

1172
01:20:17,438 --> 01:20:20,408
- God bless us.
- God bless us.

1173
01:20:20,476 --> 01:20:22,207
Every one.

1174
01:20:23,817 --> 01:20:27,085
<i>The love we found</i>

1175
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:30,719
<i>The love we found</i>

1176
01:20:30,795 --> 01:20:33,322
<i>We carry with us</i>

1177
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:37,501
<i>So we're never quite alone</i>

1178
01:20:38,511 --> 01:20:42,108
<i>The love we found</i>

1179
01:20:42,183 --> 01:20:45,088
<i>The love we found</i>

1180
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:48,789
<i>The sweetest dream</i>

1181
01:20:48,864 --> 01:20:53,166
<i>That we have ever known</i>

1182
01:20:53,238 --> 01:20:56,142
Hey, say goodbye!

1183
01:20:57,346 --> 01:21:00,249
<i>The love we found</i>

1184
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:03,714
Goodbye, goodbye.

1185
01:21:03,791 --> 01:21:08,233
<i>So we're never quite alone</i>

1186
01:21:09,168 --> 01:21:11,001
Nice story, Mr. Dickens.

1187
01:21:11,072 --> 01:21:14,340
Thanks. If you like this,
you should read the book.

1188
01:21:14,412 --> 01:21:17,349
<i>It's in the singing
of a street corner choir</i>

1189
01:21:17,417 --> 01:21:20,013
<i>It's going home
and getting warm by the fire</i>

1190
01:21:20,088 --> 01:21:23,186
<i>It's true wherever you find love</i>

1191
01:21:23,262 --> 01:21:25,754
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

1192
01:21:25,834 --> 01:21:28,531
<i>A cup of kindness
that we share with another</i>

1193
01:21:28,604 --> 01:21:31,336
<i>A sweet reunion
with a friend or a brother</i>

1194
01:21:31,411 --> 01:21:34,439
<i>In all the places you find love</i>

1195
01:21:34,515 --> 01:21:37,818
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

1196
01:21:37,888 --> 01:21:41,886
<i>It is the season of the heart</i>

1197
01:21:41,964 --> 01:21:44,834
<i>A special time of caring</i>

1198
01:21:44,902 --> 01:21:48,636
<i>The ways of love made clear</i>

1199
01:21:48,710 --> 01:21:53,515
<i>And it is the season
of the spirit</i>

1200
01:21:53,585 --> 01:21:56,215
<i>The message if we hear it</i>

1201
01:21:56,290 --> 01:22:00,527
<i>Is make it last all year</i>

1202
01:22:00,598 --> 01:22:06,166
Oh, Yes! Make it last all year.

1203
01:22:06,242 --> 01:22:08,211
<i>It's in the giving of a gift
to another</i>

1204
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:11,080
<i>A pair of mittens
that were made by your mother</i>

1205
01:22:11,152 --> 01:22:14,249
<i>It's all the ways that we show love</i>

1206
01:22:14,324 --> 01:22:16,761
<i>That feel like Christmas</i>

1207
01:22:16,830 --> 01:22:19,461
<i>A part of childhood
we'll always remember</i>

1208
01:22:19,534 --> 01:22:22,232
<i>It is the summer of the soul
in December</i>

1209
01:22:22,307 --> 01:22:25,506
<i>Yes, when you do your best
for love</i>

1210
01:22:25,579 --> 01:22:27,879
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

1211
01:22:27,949 --> 01:22:32,892
<i>And remember,
it is the season of the heart</i>

1212
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,863
<i>A special time of caring</i>

1213
01:22:35,931 --> 01:22:40,031
<i>The ways of love made clear</i>

1214
01:22:40,107 --> 01:22:44,274
<i>It is the season of the spirit</i>

1215
01:22:44,348 --> 01:22:47,184
<i>The message, if we hear it</i>

1216
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:51,126
<i>Is make it last all year</i>

1217
01:22:56,403 --> 01:22:59,308
<i>It's in the singing
of a street corner choir</i>

1218
01:22:59,377 --> 01:23:02,108
<i>It's going home
and getting warm by the fire</i>

1219
01:23:02,182 --> 01:23:05,382
<i>It's true wherever you find love</i>

1220
01:23:05,454 --> 01:23:07,788
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

1221
01:23:07,859 --> 01:23:13,268
<i>It's true wherever you find love</i>

1222
01:23:14,672 --> 01:23:18,703
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

1223
01:23:22,119 --> 01:23:26,150
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

1224
01:23:27,663 --> 01:23:31,899
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

1225
01:23:33,273 --> 01:23:39,947
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>
