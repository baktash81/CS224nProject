1
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,577
Nice.

2
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,328
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

3
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,007
You hungry?

4
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,177
You know, you gotta come get it.
Don't play hard to get.

5
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:15,804
You'll like it.

6
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,182
It's cat.

7
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:21,977
There you go.

8
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,981
I don't know what...

9
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,153
Leave room for breakfast.

10
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:38,549
Hello?

11
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,810
Please. Don't hurt me.

12
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,478
Here, take anything you want.

13
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:55,232
You want some food? Take it.

14
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,320
-I'm not gonna hurt you.
-Yeah?

15
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,531
That's what the last guy said.

16
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:08,704
Could... Could you help me?
The wheel came off.

17
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,248
I can't fix it.

18
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:16,044
Maybe if I... If I could, but I can't.

19
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:21,091
You know,
the only good thing about no soap

20
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,803
is that you can smell hijackers a mile off.

21
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,348
I am impressed!

22
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:33,812
This man smelled us from 30 feet away!

23
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:35,981
Damn!

24
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,109
What's that say about our hygiene?

25
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,238
What you got there in that pack?

26
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,740
What pack?

27
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,242
He got a gun.

28
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,870
Shit, it ain't loaded.

29
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,706
They never are.

30
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,335
Ain't that right, old man?

31
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:03,967
Open the pack and tip it out on the road,
nice and slow.

32
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,262
Can't do that.

33
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,770
Take off the fucking pack
and put it on the ground.

34
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,147
Or die!

35
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,195
Are you listening to me?

36
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,988
I am now.

37
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:27,866
-Good.
-You listening to me?

38
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:30,035
-Yeah.
-Good.

39
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,663
Put that hand on me again,
you won't get it back.

40
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,294
Do you believe this fucking guy?

41
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,089
All right, you wanna do it the hard way.

42
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,598
How'd you do that?

43
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,059
He just cut my hand off!

44
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:02,943
What are you standing around for?
Kiss him!

45
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,862
What did he say?

46
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,489
He's in shock.

47
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,119
I think he meant "Kill him."

48
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:45,027
I can't feel my hand. My hand.

49
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:51,366
I told you you weren't gonna get that back.

50
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,042
Yeah, you did.

51
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,884
Who are you?

52
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,096
Where's your water?

53
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,182
They don't have none.
They were gonna take yours.

54
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:42,144
And then eat you. It's true.

55
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,984
It's in the cart.

56
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:21,933
You're not taking it?

57
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,771
-Where are you going?
-West.

58
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,190
-Can I come with you?
-No.

59
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,609
But...

60
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,392
We'll find shelter for tonight.

61
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,269
My legs still hurt.

62
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,564
God.

63
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,828
No! No!

64
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,121
-Nice shot!
-Mike! No!

65
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,752
-No!
-We got her.

66
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,755
Honey? Come here!

67
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:36,675
No, no.

68
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:40,303
-Please, don't. Please, God, no!
-Stay on the path.

69
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,806
-Stop!
-Hey, guys.

70
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,935
Stay on the path. It's not your concern.

71
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,728
No!

72
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,313
Come on!

73
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:55,026
Stay on the path. It's not your concern.
Stay on the path. It's not your concern.

74
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,314
-I don't know you.
-I know, I'm not from around here.

75
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:57,816
No shit you're not from around here.

76
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,193
-All right, I don't want any trouble.
-Oh, yeah.

77
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:03,738
Okay.

78
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,243
I'm just a customer. Okay?

79
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,911
Okay.

80
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,542
I'm sorry, I gotta see the hands.

81
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,878
I'm not one of them.

82
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,922
Okay.

83
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,843
I'm gonna take something out of my pack.

84
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,595
-Take your finger off the trigger.
-Yeah.

85
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:39,482
Sweet! That's a Fathom 900, man.

86
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:40,859
Is it?

87
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,861
I haven't seen one of those since the '90s.

88
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:44,362
Yeah, I got it back east.

89
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:46,865
-Still work?
-Yeah. Yeah. Just need it charged.

90
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:50,285
Can you do that for me? Give me a...
I got cables.

91
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,371
I don't need the cables. I can put
a trickle charger on it, though, for you.

92
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:54,664
Good.

93
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,375
I mean, if you got the coin.

94
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,294
Yes, sir.

95
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:04,549
Yes, I do. I got something...

96
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,512
-Okay.
-It's American-made.

97
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,765
Oh, yeah. I got a whole bunch of these.

98
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:12,974
-Do you?
-Yeah.

99
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,768
How about ChapStick?
You got any ChapStick?

100
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:18,938
No ChapStick, no. I got cat oil. Fresh cat oil.

101
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,399
-No, no.
-It's good, it's good for the...

102
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,151
-No, no.
-Works the same way.

103
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,570
What about toys? You got any toys?

104
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,114
No, I don't play... Oh, I got...

105
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,411
-Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
-We do chicken right.

106
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:35,747
-Eh, finger lickin' good.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

107
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,665
All right, all right, all right.

108
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,418
All right, now this, with these.

109
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:42,253
Absolutely, those are yours.

110
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:44,714
Okay. Give me a couple of hours.

111
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,216
-Charge it up for you.
-Thank you.

112
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,885
You can wait over there across the street,
at the Orpheum.

113
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:50,678
No, I'll wait here.

114
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:53,681
-Bar is about ready to open.
-I'll wait here.

115
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:56,309
You don't trust me, do you?

116
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,524
-I'll wait here.
-All right.

117
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,105
Carnegie.

118
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:47,443
One of the road crews just pulled into town.
They've got something for you.

119
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:49,279
Books?

120
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:50,947
Whole bag of them.

121
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:55,577
Tell them I wanna see them right now.

122
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,418
-Stay.
-No problem.

123
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,628
Come on, let's go.

124
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,800
We did good.

125
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:25,398
The one you want, it ain't there?

126
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:28,943
No.

127
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:32,405
I just don't understand.
That's a shitload of books.

128
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,158
You don't have to understand.

129
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:39,996
I understand.
Leave that to me and we can be friends.

130
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:43,499
I have faith in you. You'll find it.

131
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,464
Wait. I got this, too.

132
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,431
Now, this is a treat.

133
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:03,603
-That's shampoo.
-Yeah?

134
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,564
Go get slammed.

135
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,192
Get some pussy.

136
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:13,238
Everything on me,
as much as you and your boys can stand.

137
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:15,823
Then go back on the road.

138
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:18,159
And we'll get you your book.

139
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:20,745
Of that I have no doubt.

140
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:31,339
You're sending guys out
who can't even read to look for one book.

141
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,093
Well, no wonder they never find anything.

142
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:38,096
Yeah, I use the tools I have at hand.

143
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,556
Unless you'd like to go with them?

144
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,273
What about these?

145
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:49,732
Burn them.

146
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,862
This place across the street,
they got any water?

147
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,285
Yeah, if you can pay for it.

148
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,041
Here.

149
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:09,419
Smell this.

150
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,677
One of the road crews found it.

151
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:20,888
Who knows?

152
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:25,727
It may be the last shampoo on the planet.

153
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,565
And it's yours.

154
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,363
Did they find your book?

155
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,201
No.

156
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,329
Outlander?

157
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:29,082
Let me see.

158
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:35,171
-All right, what'll it be?
-Water.

159
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,759
That's the good stuff.

160
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,804
I've gotta eat into my own ration to sell it,
so it don't come cheap.

161
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,722
Right.

162
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,148
Get you maybe halfway.

163
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,589
Solara!

164
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,178
Take this and get it filled.

165
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,435
Wait. You need this.

166
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:49,454
Can you please move?

167
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,417
Thank you.

168
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,184
That was my cat.

169
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,855
Fine specimen.

170
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,983
I saw you knock him off the bar.

171
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,861
No. I kind of shooed him,
I didn't really knock him.

172
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,321
You raised your hand at him.

173
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,364
Won't happen again, I promise you.

174
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,117
Hey, Martz, how about another drink?

175
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:32,288
That cat's been coming in here for two years.

176
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:36,417
It's got more right to be here than you.

177
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,253
I don't want any trouble.

178
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,883
Well, that's too bad, 'cause you got...

179
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,475
I know who you are.

180
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,979
Murderer of innocent travelers on the road.

181
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,402
You are gonna be held to account for
the things you've done, do you know that?

182
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:06,405
Do you?

183
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:10,243
It's okay.

184
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:18,376
I'm gonna grab my things
and I'm gonna walk out of here.

185
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,836
-All right.
-All right, brother?

186
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:24,298
Yeah.

187
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:06,340
"Cursed be the ground for our sake.

188
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:13,514
"Both thorns and thistles
it shall bring forth for us.

189
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:19,645
"For out of the ground, we were taken.
For the dust, we are.

190
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:24,692
"And to the dust, we shall return."

191
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,930
Stop!

192
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:58,768
Please.

193
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:11,572
Redridge!

194
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:13,574
Redridge.

195
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,423
And who are you?

196
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:31,676
Nobody.

197
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,429
I doubt that.

198
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:39,475
The men you killed in my bar,
now, they were nobody.

199
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,145
-But you, now.
-He ain't got the shakes.

200
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,690
-He ain't one of them.
-Good.

201
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:50,277
This is a civilized town.
We don't eat humans.

202
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:55,282
We don't see too many people from before.
Not anymore.

203
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,995
-Do you read?
-Every day.

204
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,624
All right. Well, good for you. Me, too.

205
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:05,918
You know, it's funny.

206
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:10,798
As old as we are, people like you and me,
we're the future.

207
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:12,967
What do you want with me?

208
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,469
Straight to the point!

209
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:20,266
I like that!

210
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,689
You're not just educated.

211
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,651
I never saw anyone handle themselves
the way you did.

212
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:35,406
I don't know where you learned it,
but I sure as hell could use it.

213
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:39,410
This little town, just the beginning.

214
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,579
I'm about to expand.

215
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,998
I need expert help.
I could use someone like you.

216
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,543
Thank you, but I'm really not interested.

217
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,963
Well, the people who work for me
live better than any walker ever dreamed.

218
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,674
Ask Redridge here. Ask the boys, anyone.

219
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,802
Real beds, hot food, women.

220
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,515
Clean water.

221
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:04,727
You could do a lot worse, my friend.

222
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,605
Thank you,

223
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:11,776
but I got somewhere I need to be.

224
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,152
Where?

225
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,446
West.

226
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,782
There is nothing west.

227
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,825
I've been told different.

228
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,202
By who?

229
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:28,042
Tell you what.

230
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:33,047
Stay the night. Try a little local hospitality,
see how you like it.

231
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,549
We'll talk again in the morning.

232
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:39,178
Word of advice, Walker. It's not a choice.

233
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:43,474
It's always a choice.

234
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,648
There'll be someone outside your room
all night

235
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:52,399
if you need anything.

236
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,068
I don't need anything.

237
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,278
You never know.

238
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:51,876
This is for you.
It's some water for washing and some food.

239
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,880
Little special reserve, too,
compliments of the house.

240
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:04,013
I need you to take this or say something
so I can find you.

241
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:19,361
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

242
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:22,239
-Can I get you anything else?
-No, I'm fine. Thank you.

243
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:25,326
Did you get blinded in the war
or by the sun after?

244
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,581
I was born this way.

245
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,542
I think probably I'm lucky,
because I was already used to being like this

246
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:35,669
by the time it happened.

247
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:38,923
Right, well, thank you for the food.

248
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,050
You're welcome.

249
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,012
I like your perfume.

250
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:51,435
It's just shampoo,

251
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:54,188
but thank you.

252
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,192
Good night.

253
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,636
I don't think he's gonna change his mind
by the morning.

254
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,514
He's not gonna stay.

255
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:35,062
He's different than the others.

256
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:40,109
You're not gonna be able to make him do
what you want him to do.

257
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:44,113
Who said anything about me?

258
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,492
I'll send Solara.

259
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,498
You can't do that.

260
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,710
It's about time I got better use out of her.

261
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,171
Don't.

262
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,424
Please.

263
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:08,595
Please, don't. Please. Please.

264
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,932
Please!

265
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,529
Can I come in?

266
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,742
Give me a minute.

267
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,670
Somebody already came
with food and water.

268
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,133
I got everything I need.

269
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,473
Are you sure about that?

270
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,395
It's really bright in here.

271
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:01,231
I'm Solara.

272
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:05,069
Right. You filled my canteen downstairs.

273
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,989
Yeah. You're the walker, right?

274
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,241
Right.

275
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:18,373
If you're worried about paying,
it's on the house.

276
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,084
Paying for what?

277
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,171
Why don't you take a seat?

278
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,265
No.

279
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:41,188
No, I can't go. I can't.
If I do, he'll hurt my mom.

280
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,191
-Who?
-Carnegie.

281
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,402
He's your father?

282
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:51,198
No. No, but we belong to him just the same.

283
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,535
Look, I'll sleep on the floor.

284
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,245
Tomorrow you can tell him
you had a good time.

285
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:59,081
I promise you I will be no trouble.

286
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:04,211
Please?

287
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:14,763
Knight to bishop four.

288
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,314
Your move.

289
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,949
So, how old are you?

290
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,326
Excuse me?

291
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:41,248
It's just that I haven't really seen too many
people your age come through here before.

292
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,542
Well, it's been

293
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:50,215
30 winters since the flash.

294
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,304
I really don't remember.

295
00:41:56,598 --> 00:42:00,851
Do you remember what it was like?
I mean, in the world before.

296
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,186
Yeah.

297
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,774
Well, what was it like?

298
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,323
People had more than they needed.

299
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:20,621
We had no idea what was precious,
what wasn't.

300
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:29,338
We threw away things
people kill each other for now.

301
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:33,467
-Really?
-Yeah.

302
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:37,095
You have a book.

303
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,306
-Can I see it?
-No, you cannot.

304
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,600
-I just, I just wanna look at it.
-No. I said no.

305
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:44,311
Listen, I can't even read!
Come on, please, let me just see it.

306
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,065
What is with you? lt is just a book!

307
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,900
It's not just a book.

308
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,070
-What do you mean, it's not just a book?
-Look.

309
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:57,658
No more questions about the book, all right?
No more questions. All right?

310
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:25,102
I got a question for you, since you're here.

311
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,938
Well, maybe I'll answer it and maybe I won't.

312
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,733
Where do you get your water?

313
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:34,069
Can't tell you that.

314
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:37,281
-You can't tell me or you don't know?
-Oh, I know.

315
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:43,161
But if you're not talking about the book,
I'm not talking about the water.

316
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,834
You're something else, you know.

317
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:51,628
All right, I got another question for you.

318
00:43:51,713 --> 00:43:53,338
Right.

319
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:55,632
You hungry?

320
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:57,718
There's a lot of food there,

321
00:43:58,094 --> 00:43:59,845
more than I can eat.

322
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,389
Tell you what.

323
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:06,893
We can share it, you know,
like old people used to.

324
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:11,023
Okay.

325
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:12,232
Okay?
SUBTITLES BY ChEtAn

326
00:44:16,863 --> 00:44:19,573
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait. Sit.

327
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:22,993
Sit.

328
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,913
This'll be for you.

329
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,082
Give me your hands.

330
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:32,586
What are you doing?

331
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,921
Trust me. Give me your hands.

332
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:40,927
Close your eyes.

333
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,849
Dear Lord, we thank you for this meal.

334
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:49,394
We thank you for a warm bed

335
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:53,357
and a roof over our head
on cold nights such as this.

336
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:56,151
It's been too long.

337
00:44:56,486 --> 00:44:58,070
Is this from your book?

338
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,782
Don't interrupt. Close your eyes.

339
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:08,038
We thank you for the gift of companionship

340
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,457
in hard times like these.

341
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:12,709
Amen.

342
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:18,840
Now we eat?

343
00:45:20,093 --> 00:45:21,635
Now we eat.

344
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:54,167
Good morning, Solara.

345
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,672
How was your night? Did you sleep well?

346
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,424
I did like you said.

347
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:02,926
Of course you did what I said.

348
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:07,347
But did it work? Is he staying?

349
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,350
We didn't do much talking.

350
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:13,520
Solara, honey, eat something.

351
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,025
Mom, give me your hand.

352
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:23,363
Close your eyes.

353
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:25,532
Mom, trust me.

354
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,457
Dear Lord.

355
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:37,461
We thank you for our food.

356
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,755
Thank you for my mother.

357
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:46,428
Thank you for the roof over our heads
and our new friends.

358
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,474
And...

359
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,899
Well, I guess that's all for now.

360
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:00,901
Amen.

361
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:09,784
That's the word you're looking for. Amen.

362
00:47:12,205 --> 00:47:13,955
That's how you stop.

363
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:23,173
You said you didn't talk much.

364
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,469
But did he do any reading?

365
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:32,432
-I asked you a question.
-Bill, don't.

366
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:35,101
You. Shut your mouth.

367
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,030
Stop!

368
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:49,783
You're hurting your mother, Solara.

369
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:53,912
He said he read every day. Did he?

370
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:56,373
Stop it!

371
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,376
Your mother would like you to tell me.

372
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:03,547
I don't know!

373
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,972
Yes, okay! Yes, yes, he was reading.

374
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,891
-What kind of book was he reading?
-I don't know!

375
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:17,310
-I don't know! An old leather one!
-And?

376
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,400
I don't know,
it had some kind of thing on the front of it!

377
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:25,735
-Show me.
-I need you to let her go!

378
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,279
Show me!

379
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,043
Redridge!

380
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:57,183
Shit! He was here the whole night.

381
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:58,685
Where is he?

382
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,688
I don't... I don't...

383
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,403
-I just wanna make sure that you know that...
-I understand.

384
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,113
...there's no acid in there.
That's swamp water.

385
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,115
It doesn't matter.
Just take these off. Take them off.

386
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,618
-All right. Well, let me, all right, just...
-Take them off.

387
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:17,287
-Hey!
-All right. You got it, coming off.

388
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,413
-Thank you.
-Coming off.

389
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,290
You can tell them I made you do it, all right?

390
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,374
All right.

391
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:23,543
-Say it.
-You made me do it.

392
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:52,781
Is that thing loaded?
I don't think it's loaded.

393
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:54,949
One way to find out.

394
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,827
Look, I need that book.

395
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:02,582
I mean, I want the book and you,

396
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:06,920
but if you make me choose,
I'll kill you, I'll take the book.

397
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:10,840
Why? Why do you want it?

398
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:15,011
I grew up with it.

399
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,430
I know its power.

400
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,600
And if you read it, then so do you.

401
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:24,437
That's why they burned them all
after the war.

402
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:29,025
Just staying alive is an act of faith.

403
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:31,403
Building this town
is an even bigger act of faith,

404
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:33,738
but they don't understand that,

405
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:35,949
none of them.

406
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:40,954
And I don't have the right words
to help them, but the book does.

407
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:45,333
Now, I admit

408
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:48,002
that I've had to do things,

409
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:51,673
many, many things, that I hate, to build this.
I confess that.

410
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:55,719
But if we have that book,

411
00:50:56,846 --> 00:50:58,555
I wouldn't have to.

412
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,558
Now imagine.

413
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:06,229
Imagine how different,
how righteous this little world could be

414
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,648
if we had the right words for our faith.

415
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:11,401
The people would truly understand
why they're here and what they're doing

416
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:14,487
and they wouldn't need
any of the uglier motivations.

417
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:21,870
It's not right to keep that book hidden away.
It's meant to be shared with others.

418
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:23,997
It's meant to be spread.

419
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:26,374
lsn't that what you want?

420
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:28,501
With all of my heart and soul.

421
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,505
I always believed that

422
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:37,677
I'd find a place where this book belonged,
where it was needed.

423
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:43,433
But I haven't found it yet.

424
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:57,489
I love this guy.

425
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,370
Shoot him, please.

426
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:27,727
What are you standing around for?

427
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,731
Take him out, God damn it! Take him out!

428
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:38,316
I don't like being followed.

429
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,777
I wanna come with you!

430
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:42,487
No, you don't.

431
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:44,530
I hate it here.

432
00:54:45,658 --> 00:54:49,285
-Then change it.
-My mother thinks I'll be safer with you.

433
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,585
I'll take you to where we get our water.

434
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:00,254
You can have all that you can carry.

435
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:11,683
I mean, all that we can carry.

436
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:20,274
Carnegie knows
about two more springs up north.

437
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:22,819
He says he's gonna build more towns.

438
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:26,322
How'd he know about this one?

439
00:55:26,407 --> 00:55:29,575
He'd been here when he was young.

440
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:33,496
In the world before.

441
00:55:34,123 --> 00:55:37,041
I guess everyone else
who knew about it died.

442
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,587
We really better hurry.

443
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:49,929
I think I left my glasses inside.
Just take a look for me. I'll look out here.

444
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:51,014
Okay.

445
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,397
What are you doing?

446
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:04,110
You are such a liar!

447
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:09,115
I'm not a liar.

448
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,993
You said I could come with you
if you got your water!

449
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:14,495
I didn't say that. You said that.

450
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:17,498
Besides, the road's no place for you.

451
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:20,251
It's much worse than you think.

452
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:23,713
Goodbye, Solara.
It's nice knowing you, I mean that.

453
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,965
-Hey.
-Yeah?

454
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:28,051
Fuck you!

455
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:45,568
Have you washed your filthy fucking hands?

456
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:48,362
Twice. With your soap.

457
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:54,911
Put a crew together. We're going after him.

458
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:56,454
For a fucking book.

459
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:59,040
It's not a fucking book!

460
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,667
It's a weapon!

461
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:07,799
A weapon aimed right at the hearts
and minds of the weak and the desperate!

462
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:10,218
It will give us control of them!

463
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:17,183
If we wanna rule more than one
small fucking town, we have to have it!

464
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:21,437
People will come from all over,
they'll do exactly what I tell them

465
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:25,024
if the words are from the book.

466
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:33,533
It's happened before,
and it'll happen again.

467
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:35,493
All we need is that book.

468
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:51,926
Then I want Solara.

469
00:57:57,057 --> 00:57:59,183
Are you bargaining with me?

470
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:03,271
Is this a deal we're making here?

471
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,400
We lost a lot of men.

472
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:10,069
You need me more than ever.

473
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:15,241
Now, you say that book's worth the trouble.
Well, I believe you,

474
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:19,662
but I want Solara for it.

475
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:35,303
Why not? Why not?

476
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:39,098
Let's get the fuck out of here.

477
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:46,939
Stay on the path. It's not your concern.
Stay on the path. It's not your concern.

478
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:15,092
Which way are we headed?

479
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:16,844
West.

480
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:57,510
Hello?

481
00:59:58,887 --> 01:00:00,680
Can anyone help me?

482
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:04,475
Hello? Is anybody there?

483
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:15,611
Are you okay?

484
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:22,618
Yes. I'm fine. You go along. I'll be okay.

485
01:00:22,703 --> 01:00:26,956
-No, no, here, let me just help you.
-No, really, please. I'm fine. Really.

486
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:31,377
I need a man to help, not you.
You just go along.

487
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:35,506
-It's okay, it'll just take a minute.
-No! It's fine. Please.

488
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,367
Help! Help!

489
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,000
Get off me!

490
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,092
Thank you!

491
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:21,672
Over there.

492
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:31,640
What's wrong?

493
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:34,185
You hear that?

494
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:36,812
Hear what?

495
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:43,360
Don't move. Don't move.

496
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:01,295
Here. Take the wire off of that.

497
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:03,422
Spool it up.

498
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:06,926
-What is that?
-Dinner.

499
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:29,281
It's like he's protected somehow,

500
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:33,118
like there's nothing that can touch him.

501
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:37,039
He's just a fucking man.

502
01:04:38,959 --> 01:04:42,378
You put a bullet in him,
he'll go down like any other.

503
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:48,968
Still warm.

504
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:54,723
No more than a few hours dead.

505
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,020
He can't be far.

506
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:09,113
Son of a bitch!

507
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:13,742
Solara.

508
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:17,580
Are you sure you still want her?

509
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:26,714
It's gonna be dark soon. We can't track them
at night, they'll see us coming.

510
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:30,092
We could drive right past them
and never know it.

511
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:32,261
He's right.

512
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:35,598
They're on foot, tired. They'll have to sleep.

513
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:42,855
We'll make up the ground tomorrow.
We'll have them before morning's out.

514
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,442
That better be a guarantee.

515
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:06,670
Do you really read the same book every day?

516
01:06:06,755 --> 01:06:08,213
Without fail.

517
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:14,094
Will you read some to me?

518
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:18,015
Please?

519
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:25,564
"The Lord is my shepherd.

520
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:28,233
"I shall not want.

521
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:34,323
"He makes me to lie down in green pastures.

522
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:38,243
"Leads me beside the still waters.

523
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:41,038
"He restores my soul.

524
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:47,378
"He leadeth me in the path of righteousness,
for his name's sake.

525
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:54,927
"Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death

526
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:59,181
"I will fear no evil, for thou art with me."
SUBTITLES BY ChEtAn

527
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:03,102
-That's beautiful.
-You like that?

528
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:06,230
-Did you write that?
-Yes, I did.

529
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:08,273
Really?

530
01:07:08,817 --> 01:07:10,984
No, no. No.

531
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:16,365
No, that was around a long time
before you and I got here, that's for sure.

532
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:25,499
What did you mean
when you said it's not just any book?

533
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:37,261
It's the only one.

534
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:40,806
Really?

535
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:43,350
After the war, people made it their business

536
01:07:43,435 --> 01:07:47,229
to find and destroy
any that the fires didn't get already.

537
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:51,483
Some people said this was the reason
for the war in the first place.

538
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:55,654
Anyway, it's the only one that survived.

539
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,826
How'd you get it?

540
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:08,375
They said that the war

541
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:12,296
tore a hole in the sky,
you've probably heard the stories.

542
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:13,505
Yeah.

543
01:08:13,882 --> 01:08:17,050
Tore a hole in the sky, sun came down

544
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:20,095
and burned everything.

545
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:22,556
Everything and everybody.

546
01:08:23,183 --> 01:08:27,561
You were lucky to hole up and hide
in a place like this or underground.

547
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:32,316
Most people weren't lucky.

548
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:38,822
So, a year later, we started coming out,

549
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:40,574
and people wandered around.

550
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:46,538
I, not knowing what I was gonna do,
trying to find a place to survive.

551
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:50,542
One day, I heard a voice.

552
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:54,797
It's hard to explain, but it was like it...

553
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:57,758
Like it was coming from inside of me.

554
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:02,888
But I could hear it
as clear as I can hear you talking to me now.

555
01:09:03,431 --> 01:09:05,390
What did this voice say?

556
01:09:05,934 --> 01:09:07,267
It led me

557
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:10,729
to a place where I found the book

558
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:13,273
buried under some rubble.

559
01:09:17,237 --> 01:09:21,031
The voice told me
to carry the book out west.

560
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:26,161
Told me that a path would be laid out for me,

561
01:09:26,246 --> 01:09:30,833
that I'd be led to a place
where the book was safe.

562
01:09:34,546 --> 01:09:36,755
Told me that I'd be protected

563
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:41,343
against anyone or anything
that stood in my path.

564
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:46,932
I've been walking ever since.

565
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:52,271
And you did all that
because a voice in your head told you to?

566
01:09:53,106 --> 01:09:54,439
Yes, I did.

567
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:57,067
I know what I heard.

568
01:09:57,485 --> 01:09:59,236
I know what I hear.

569
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:01,572
I know I'm not crazy.

570
01:10:02,282 --> 01:10:05,450
And I know I would've never made it
without help.

571
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:09,329
-What's that?
-One question too many.

572
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:12,916
Go to bed,
we got an early start in the morning.

573
01:10:50,580 --> 01:11:04,801
Hey.

574
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:16,939
What are you doing?

575
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:19,816
-I'm sorry, I thought you were sleeping.
-I wasn't sleeping.

576
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:21,652
What are you doing?

577
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:23,820
I just wanted to see the book.

578
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:26,865
Nobody touches it but me,
you understand me?

579
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:29,076
Do you understand me?

580
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,870
-Yes, I understand.
-Good. Go to sleep.

581
01:11:41,839 --> 01:11:44,758
You said you don't know
how to read anyway. It's no use to you.

582
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:45,926
Yeah.

583
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:48,387
So teach me.

584
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:10,784
Hold up. Hold up! Stop!

585
01:12:16,624 --> 01:12:18,959
You know, you say you've been walking
for 30 years, right?

586
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:20,252
Right.

587
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:22,379
Have you ever thought
that maybe you were lost?

588
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:23,588
Nope.

589
01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:26,008
Well, how do you know
that you're walking in the right direction?

590
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:28,552
"We walk by faith, not by sight."

591
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:30,804
What does that mean?

592
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:34,516
It means that you know something,
even if you don't know something.

593
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,684
That doesn't make any sense.

594
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:37,728
Doesn't have to make sense, it's faith.
It's faith.

595
01:12:37,812 --> 01:12:40,814
It's the flower of light
in the field of darkness

596
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:43,358
that's giving me the strength to carry on.
You understand?

597
01:12:43,443 --> 01:12:44,693
Is that from your book?

598
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:48,739
No, it's Johnny Cash live at Folsom Prison.

599
01:12:49,449 --> 01:12:50,532
What?

600
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:16,516
-Do you think anyone lives there?
-I don't know.

601
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:19,978
Maybe there's water.

602
01:13:29,864 --> 01:13:31,406
Stay behind me.

603
01:13:36,621 --> 01:13:38,121
This is weird.

604
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:14,699
Who are you?

605
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:21,206
We're travelers, that's all.
Don't mean any harm.

606
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:24,126
No trespassing! Haven't you read the sign?

607
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:27,462
We're very sorry. I didn't see it.

608
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:29,131
What's your business?

609
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:30,298
-We were just...
-No business!

610
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:34,803
Just... We're very sorry,
and if you let us, we'll be on our way.

611
01:14:35,513 --> 01:14:38,890
George, look at them.
One of them is just a girl.

612
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:42,894
Yeah. It's an old story,
I've heard it a hundred times before.

613
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:47,399
We get so few visitors these days.
George is suspicious of everybody.

614
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:51,403
I'm Martha. Would you care for some tea?

615
01:15:02,165 --> 01:15:05,041
How about some music? It's so soothing.

616
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:06,960
George!

617
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:30,442
How do you like it? It's nice. Please.

618
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:45,123
-Is that good?
-Good, good. That's... Taste is rich.

619
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:53,548
It's amazing that you two
have survived out here all by yourselves.

620
01:15:53,633 --> 01:15:56,885
Well, now,
George is something of a handyman.

621
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:02,557
He did a lot of work on this place,
making it safe.

622
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:05,268
We may be old, but we're resilient.

623
01:16:05,937 --> 01:16:08,939
We've known more than a few
who've tried to take this place from us.

624
01:16:09,023 --> 01:16:11,191
-Haven't we, George?
-Yes, we have.

625
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:13,902
-Right.
-I wanna show you something. Come on.

626
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:16,238
George, no! Not now!

627
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:18,490
Come on!

628
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:23,370
-Are these...
-Graves? Sure.

629
01:16:23,663 --> 01:16:25,830
Be uncivilized not to bury them.

630
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:28,333
Besides, it's good for the soil.

631
01:16:29,293 --> 01:16:32,796
Come on back inside. I think I might be
able to rustle you up some sandwiches.

632
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,173
Well, thank you, thank you very much.

633
01:16:35,258 --> 01:16:36,800
-We gotta go now.
-They killed all these people.

634
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:38,468
They didn't just kill them, they ate them.

635
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:41,471
-Her hands... Her hands were shaking.
-Too much human meat. Let's go.

636
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:44,849
I found some meat. I hope you're hungry.

637
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:46,559
Nope. No, thank you.

638
01:16:46,644 --> 01:16:49,437
Well, we... We gotta be going.

639
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:51,731
-So soon?
-Yeah, I'm afraid so.

640
01:16:51,816 --> 01:16:54,442
-Are you sure you won't stay?
-I'm sure, I'm very sure.

641
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:56,319
Put the gun down.

642
01:16:56,487 --> 01:16:58,280
Solara, you take this.
Open the door for us, please.

643
01:16:58,364 --> 01:17:00,490
-Solara, say thank you for the tea.
-Thank you for the tea.

644
01:17:00,574 --> 01:17:01,783
Thank you so much for the tea.

645
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,293
Go back inside.

646
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:16,298
George, what's wrong?

647
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:18,800
Whole company of armed degenerates,
that's what's wrong!

648
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:20,427
And they led them straight to us.

649
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:23,847
-I just set out the good china.
-Fuck the china!

650
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:25,140
Have you got any more weapons?

651
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:27,934
Weapons? I'll show you some weapons.

652
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:33,690
-Can you shoot a gun?
-Of course.

653
01:17:35,026 --> 01:17:36,860
Come on, come on!

654
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:39,154
We know you're in there!

655
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:42,866
Come on out and nobody needs to get hurt!

656
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:49,497
I'll make it easy!

657
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:52,584
Send out Solara with the book!

658
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:55,587
-What are we gonna do?
-I know what the fuck I'm doing!

659
01:17:55,671 --> 01:18:00,467
-Wait, wait, wait.
-That's all I want, the book and the girl!

660
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:04,137
They ain't coming out.

661
01:18:29,914 --> 01:18:33,625
Shit! Get down! Everybody, get down!

662
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:54,771
Hey! You know that voice you heard?

663
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,815
Did it say anything about this?

664
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:59,317
We'll get out alive, both of us!

665
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:00,985
What about us?

666
01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:03,530
Didn't mention you!

667
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:16,209
Cease fire!

668
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:28,888
Martha? Martha?

669
01:19:28,973 --> 01:19:32,016
Martha! Martha!

670
01:19:35,229 --> 01:19:38,273
-Martha.
-Go in on the side! Over on the side!

671
01:19:38,357 --> 01:19:39,816
You bastards!

672
01:19:40,568 --> 01:19:43,611
-The side of the house!
-You fucking bastards!

673
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:52,370
-Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
-What are they doing?

674
01:19:52,455 --> 01:19:54,122
Nothing good.

675
01:21:08,072 --> 01:21:09,697
Where's the book?

676
01:21:16,622 --> 01:21:18,164
Check his pack.

677
01:21:36,809 --> 01:21:38,309
It ain't here.

678
01:21:41,105 --> 01:21:45,942
This is your last chance. You give it up
or I swear I'll bury you out here.

679
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:58,329
Son of a bitch.

680
01:21:58,664 --> 01:22:00,456
Let's try this again.

681
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:07,130
-Carnegie!
-What?

682
01:22:17,308 --> 01:22:20,810
Now, where's the book?

683
01:22:26,025 --> 01:22:28,067
Give him the book, please.

684
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:34,532
Don't tell him.

685
01:22:43,542 --> 01:22:46,794
It's in the house, back of the TV.

686
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:50,590
Go check the TV!

687
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:52,508
The what?

688
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:56,679
You're fucking shitting me. You, go! Go!

689
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:36,260
Ask, and you shall receive.

690
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:43,643
God is good, is he not?

691
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:46,646
All the time.

692
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:50,650
Not all the time.

693
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:18,928
No! No!

694
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:05,767
You see?

695
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:09,687
What did I tell you?

696
01:25:15,694 --> 01:25:17,320
He's just a man.

697
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,826
No! Leave him alone!

698
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:26,120
Please, stop!

699
01:25:32,711 --> 01:25:34,837
Where's your protection now?

700
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:51,312
Pray for me.

701
01:25:54,817 --> 01:25:55,900
Okay?

702
01:26:00,656 --> 01:26:02,031
I mean it.

703
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:21,319
No!

704
01:27:29,202 --> 01:27:30,494
Shit!

705
01:27:31,997 --> 01:27:33,414
Go back!

706
01:28:17,209 --> 01:28:19,043
Come on! Come on!

707
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:22,690
We barely got enough fuel to make it back.
You wanna go after her?

708
01:29:24,109 --> 01:29:25,151
No.

709
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:50,903
-Where are you going?
-I'm going west. Gotta go west.

710
01:30:53,615 --> 01:30:54,698
Hey!

711
01:31:01,915 --> 01:31:03,040
Here.

712
01:31:20,225 --> 01:31:21,559
I'm sorry.

713
01:31:22,102 --> 01:31:23,561
For what?

714
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:26,480
-This. This is all my fault.
-No, it's not.

715
01:31:26,565 --> 01:31:30,818
No, it is. If I didn't come with you,
none of this would've happened.

716
01:31:31,653 --> 01:31:33,404
It's not your fault.

717
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:37,825
I did what I had to do.

718
01:31:37,909 --> 01:31:41,370
I didn't think anything could make you
give up that book.

719
01:31:41,454 --> 01:31:43,914
I thought it was too important.

720
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:50,588
All the years I've been carrying it
and reading it every day.

721
01:31:52,424 --> 01:31:55,342
I got so caught up with keeping it safe,

722
01:31:55,427 --> 01:31:59,722
I forgot to live by what I learned from it.

723
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:02,766
Yeah, and what's that?

724
01:32:03,768 --> 01:32:04,935
Just...

725
01:32:08,273 --> 01:32:11,400
Do for others more than you do for yourself.

726
01:32:13,695 --> 01:32:16,322
That's what I got from it, anyway.

727
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:04,453
You smell that?

728
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:07,331
-What?
-In the air?

729
01:33:07,457 --> 01:33:08,666
Salt?

730
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:15,881
We're getting close to the ocean.

731
01:34:14,899 --> 01:34:19,778
That's it.

732
01:34:52,854 --> 01:34:54,480
Get the Engineer!

733
01:36:26,573 --> 01:36:28,240
That's far enough!

734
01:36:29,534 --> 01:36:31,618
What's your business here?

735
01:36:33,121 --> 01:36:34,663
My name is Eli!

736
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:38,417
I have a King James Bible in my possession.

737
01:36:38,501 --> 01:36:40,002
Remain where you are!

738
01:36:40,086 --> 01:36:44,173
Don't attempt to make any sudden moves,
or you will be fired upon!

739
01:37:01,065 --> 01:37:04,443
Be careful with it. Be careful.

740
01:37:11,242 --> 01:37:12,868
Careful with it.

741
01:37:22,962 --> 01:37:24,463
They're clean.

742
01:37:25,757 --> 01:37:28,592
We've been doing this for a long time now.

743
01:37:30,762 --> 01:37:34,097
-Feels like a museum.
-No, it's much more than that.

744
01:37:34,557 --> 01:37:37,351
This is where we're going to start again.

745
01:37:38,061 --> 01:37:41,855
We've got a printing press.
It'll be operational quite soon.

746
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:45,359
We're going to teach people
about the world they lost.

747
01:37:45,443 --> 01:37:47,653
Help them start to rebuild it.

748
01:37:47,737 --> 01:37:52,157
I mean, look. Shakespeare.
Britannica, missing only a few volumes.

749
01:37:52,408 --> 01:37:56,161
There's a whole series of beautiful Mozart
and Wagner records

750
01:37:56,246 --> 01:37:58,497
in still very pristine condition.

751
01:37:58,581 --> 01:38:01,291
But never a Bible. Well, not until now.

752
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:05,128
Well, may I ask what condition it's in?

753
01:38:06,839 --> 01:38:08,298
It's beat up,

754
01:38:09,259 --> 01:38:11,134
but it will do the job.

755
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:14,888
-Do you think I could see it?
-Yes, you may.

756
01:38:22,730 --> 01:38:25,148
-That's it. It's open.
-You there?

757
01:38:59,767 --> 01:39:01,310
Do you have anything to write on?

758
01:39:01,394 --> 01:39:04,354
Could you get us
some writing paper, please?

759
01:39:05,023 --> 01:39:06,607
And a lot of it.

760
01:39:08,151 --> 01:39:09,818
A whole lot of it.

761
01:39:10,862 --> 01:39:12,237
It can't be.

762
01:39:13,865 --> 01:39:14,865
It...

763
01:39:19,996 --> 01:39:21,580
It's impossible!

764
01:39:23,291 --> 01:39:24,708
It can't be!

765
01:39:27,879 --> 01:39:31,381
Pay close attention and write down

766
01:39:33,176 --> 01:39:34,885
everything I say

767
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:39,014
exactly as I say it.

768
01:39:43,686 --> 01:39:45,771
"The first book of Moses.

769
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:50,525
"Called Genesis.

770
01:39:51,277 --> 01:39:54,446
"Chapter one, verse one.

771
01:39:58,368 --> 01:40:00,118
"In the beginning,

772
01:40:01,412 --> 01:40:03,372
"God created the heavens

773
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:07,084
"and the earth.

774
01:40:11,005 --> 01:40:12,339
"Verse two.

775
01:40:14,759 --> 01:40:18,720
"And the earth was without form

776
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:23,183
"and void.

777
01:40:28,022 --> 01:40:29,564
"And darkness

778
01:40:31,734 --> 01:40:34,653
"was upon the face of the deep.

779
01:40:38,324 --> 01:40:40,409
"And the Spirit of God

780
01:40:42,453 --> 01:40:43,912
"was hovering

781
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:49,000
"over the face of the waters.

782
01:40:52,839 --> 01:40:54,256
"Verse three.

783
01:40:57,969 --> 01:40:59,469
"And God said,

784
01:41:03,725 --> 01:41:05,600
"'Let there be light.'

785
01:41:10,773 --> 01:41:12,649
"And there was light."

786
01:41:23,369 --> 01:41:24,995
Where is Solara?

787
01:41:28,708 --> 01:41:30,041
Out there.

788
01:41:31,169 --> 01:41:32,502
Her choice.

789
01:41:33,629 --> 01:41:37,424
I tried to bring her back. She refused.

790
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:44,097
What did you do when she refused?

791
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:52,606
-Read it.
-What did you do to my daughter?

792
01:41:52,690 --> 01:41:55,901
-Read it!
-What did you do to my daughter?

793
01:42:14,045 --> 01:42:16,087
You can start anytime.

794
01:42:24,597 --> 01:42:25,931
I'm sorry.

795
01:42:28,684 --> 01:42:31,228
It's been so long, I don't remember.

796
01:42:38,736 --> 01:42:41,571
-You have to.
-I have to? Really?

797
01:42:41,697 --> 01:42:44,241
No, no, no, no. You have to. Please.

798
01:42:47,912 --> 01:42:49,162
Your leg.

799
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:52,499
It doesn't hurt anymore.

800
01:42:54,252 --> 01:42:55,752
I can smell it.

801
01:43:10,601 --> 01:43:13,019
You worked so hard for that book.

802
01:43:14,522 --> 01:43:17,274
You sacrificed so much, so many men.

803
01:43:19,735 --> 01:43:21,778
More than you could spare.

804
01:43:23,781 --> 01:43:27,784
Now all those people who were too scared
to even say your name,

805
01:43:27,952 --> 01:43:32,122
they're downstairs, tearing up the bar
right now. Did you know that?

806
01:43:32,707 --> 01:43:35,333
And there's no one there to stop them.

807
01:43:36,669 --> 01:43:38,461
And you're feverish.

808
01:43:41,549 --> 01:43:44,885
I can't imagine what it must feel like
to have what you want so close

809
01:43:44,969 --> 01:43:48,638
-and it might as well be a million miles away.
-Stop it!

810
01:43:52,184 --> 01:43:53,935
Are you leaving me?

811
01:43:56,647 --> 01:44:01,693
Claudia?

812
01:44:05,156 --> 01:44:06,531
Claudia!

813
01:44:33,643 --> 01:44:35,143
Get away! Get away!

814
01:44:35,227 --> 01:44:36,227
It's mine!

815
01:45:55,349 --> 01:45:56,766
Dear Lord,

816
01:45:57,393 --> 01:45:59,936
thank you for giving me the strength
and the conviction

817
01:46:00,021 --> 01:46:02,814
to complete the task you entrusted to me.

818
01:46:27,381 --> 01:46:33,386
Thank you for guiding me, straight and true,
through the many obstacles in my path,

819
01:46:39,143 --> 01:46:42,687
and for keeping me resolute
when all around seemed lost.

820
01:46:43,606 --> 01:46:47,817
Thank you for your protection
and for your many signs along the way.

821
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:53,907
Thank you for any good that
I may have done. I'm so sorry about the bad.

822
01:46:55,951 --> 01:46:59,245
You don't have to leave, you know.
You're very welcome to stay here.

823
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:02,457
-You'll be perfectly safe.
-Thank you,

824
01:47:03,751 --> 01:47:06,503
but this is something that I have to do.

825
01:47:11,175 --> 01:47:12,842
Where will you go?

826
01:47:14,136 --> 01:47:15,220
Home.

827
01:47:21,393 --> 01:47:23,728
Thank you for the friend I made.

828
01:47:23,938 --> 01:47:27,107
Please watch over her
as you've watched over me.

829
01:47:48,337 --> 01:47:51,381
Thank you for finally allowing me to rest.

830
01:47:51,882 --> 01:47:53,800
I'm so very tired,

831
01:47:54,510 --> 01:47:57,262
but I go now to my rest, at peace,

832
01:47:58,347 --> 01:48:02,016
knowing that I have done right
with my time on this earth.

833
01:48:11,026 --> 01:48:12,986
I fought the good fight.

834
01:48:13,821 --> 01:48:15,572
I finished the race.

835
01:48:19,034 --> 01:48:20,660
I kept the faith.
