1
00:00:49,778 --> 00:00:53,510
Dad, you have the coolest job.

2
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,518
l should hang out with
a better class of animals.

3
00:01:00,057 --> 00:01:01,116
Oh, come on.

4
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,491
Have some class.
We got mixed company here.

5
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:12,768
You know, genetically speaking,
monkeys are our first cousins.

6
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:17,375
Uncle Bob's kids?
l'd agree with that.

7
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:18,943
No, l'm serious.

8
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:23,208
Some scientists say their diets
are more evolved.

9
00:01:23,418 --> 00:01:25,852
This is about diets again, huh?

10
00:01:26,054 --> 00:01:30,685
You should eat more fruits and
vegetables. Like monkeys do.

11
00:01:30,894 --> 00:01:36,231
Honey, the reason that monkeys
eat so many fruits and vegetables...

12
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:40,029
...is because they're not
smart enough to butcher a cow.

13
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:44,369
Your mother, bless her soul,
didn't believe the old ideas...

14
00:01:44,577 --> 00:01:47,011
...about nursing and breast-feeding.

15
00:01:47,213 --> 00:01:50,047
You were fed cheeseburgers as a baby.

16
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,584
And you're as strong as a bull.
Smell like a cow.

17
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:57,014
High cholesterol,
but there's medicine.

18
00:01:57,225 --> 00:02:01,060
An angioplasty clears it out.
You're great, honey.

19
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:06,762
l'll start working out tomorrow.

20
00:02:09,907 --> 00:02:14,845
- l'll take better care of myself.
- So you'll go on the hike with me?

21
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,049
First things first. Eat your lunch.

22
00:02:18,517 --> 00:02:19,950
We'll talk later.

23
00:02:20,987 --> 00:02:23,751
Give me that egg, pal!
Give me the egg!

24
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:27,125
Dad, stop it! What are you doing?

25
00:02:27,695 --> 00:02:29,253
lt's my egg! Come on!

26
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:33,800
lt's just an egg!

27
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,171
Okay, now l gotta choke you!

28
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:47,111
Now who's evolved?

29
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:51,578
All that salad slow you down, buddy?

30
00:02:55,127 --> 00:02:56,287
That's filthy.

31
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,361
Ten-second rule:

32
00:02:58,565 --> 00:03:01,932
Hits the ground, you can
eat it within 10 seconds.

33
00:03:36,343 --> 00:03:40,974
- Saliva one, what have you got?
- An egg 2-20. E-Gamma-Gamma. Over.

34
00:03:41,182 --> 00:03:42,774
- Any mayo?
- Affiirmative.

35
00:03:42,984 --> 00:03:43,973
Slow bowel traffiic....

36
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:47,612
Enzyme breakdown in ten.

37
00:03:47,823 --> 00:03:51,521
When I was a rookie cell,
you could eat off this place.

38
00:03:51,728 --> 00:03:53,286
Look at it now. Jeez...

39
00:03:53,596 --> 00:03:55,224
...what a disgrace.

40
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:57,196
See anything, kid?

41
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:59,062
l do.

42
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,900
Nice genes. Got chromosomes
in all the right places.

43
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:06,010
- Jones.
- A toothbrush can handle this.

44
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,177
l wish you'd take this job
more seriously.

45
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,079
You see this badge?
You see this gun?

46
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:15,949
See this gooey sackus membranous
around my personhood?

47
00:04:16,191 --> 00:04:19,957
- Here we go again.
- You dealing with a white blood cell!

48
00:04:20,695 --> 00:04:25,429
I should fiight disease in the veins!
Not here, on tartar control!

49
00:04:25,634 --> 00:04:27,432
Lucky you ain't in a scab.

50
00:04:27,637 --> 00:04:29,798
We got germs on that egg.

51
00:04:30,006 --> 00:04:32,271
Baby! lt's Ozzy time!

52
00:04:32,477 --> 00:04:35,446
Probably gingivitis,
don't get carried away.

53
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:38,207
You have entered the city ofFrank.

54
00:04:38,417 --> 00:04:40,942
Hands up.
Surrender for digestion.

55
00:04:41,553 --> 00:04:44,648
Saliva one, requesting
ground support. Over.

56
00:04:44,858 --> 00:04:47,953
Bicuspid four,
we're in the vicinity.

57
00:04:48,195 --> 00:04:51,460
This is a private organism.
Don't run.

58
00:04:51,665 --> 00:04:53,930
Up spit creek without a paddle.

59
00:04:54,736 --> 00:04:59,140
Don't get me mad.
I will turn into a germicidal maniac.

60
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:01,674
Halt. Saliva Patrol.

61
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:04,111
Son of a botulism!

62
00:05:04,314 --> 00:05:06,646
They swiped the patrol car!

63
00:05:07,618 --> 00:05:08,812
Get out ofhere.

64
00:05:10,188 --> 00:05:12,383
You done done it now.

65
00:05:18,631 --> 00:05:20,065
Holy Frank!

66
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:23,464
He 's about to yawn!

67
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:29,404
We 're getting sucked in!

68
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,239
l told city hall we need more sleep!

69
00:05:33,482 --> 00:05:34,676
Hold tight, kid!

70
00:05:36,486 --> 00:05:37,919
Osmosis Jones to dispatch.

71
00:05:38,121 --> 00:05:41,387
We got multiple germs
coming down the windpipe.

72
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:45,255
If they hit the blood stream,
we'll be illing.

73
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:47,988
Nose-dripping,
chicken-soup-drinking...

74
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,498
...rectal-thermometer-sticking,
illing!

75
00:05:50,702 --> 00:05:52,466
- Permission to pursue?
- Chief.

76
00:05:57,411 --> 00:06:00,346
- You got plans for the weekend?
- Oh, yeah.

77
00:06:00,547 --> 00:06:04,143
Me and my girlfriend are going
to the lKidneys to see the Stones.

78
00:06:04,352 --> 00:06:06,377
Good, they could pass any day.

79
00:06:06,588 --> 00:06:10,719
All units south of the stomach,
lookout for illegal organism.

80
00:06:10,926 --> 00:06:13,225
Jones, you want to keep yourjob?

81
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,057
Wait for backup!

82
00:06:15,265 --> 00:06:16,357
l can get them.

83
00:06:16,566 --> 00:06:17,966
I said stay put.

84
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,034
- Over.
- You heard the chief.

85
00:06:20,238 --> 00:06:21,967
Out ofourjurisdiction.

86
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:26,201
lt's lmmunity's problem.
We should get to the mouth.

87
00:06:26,411 --> 00:06:30,143
- Hey, Jones!
- Chief, you'll thank me later.

88
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,878
Don't think about it.
You're in enough trouble.

89
00:06:34,088 --> 00:06:35,578
Jones!

90
00:06:40,896 --> 00:06:42,488
Slow down! Slow down!

91
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:45,734
Wait, wait, what the--?

92
00:06:46,535 --> 00:06:49,003
Shouldn't you be up in the mouth?

93
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:52,403
This is my bust. l saw him first.

94
00:07:16,171 --> 00:07:19,504
You want Osmosis? You got Osmosis.

95
00:07:29,186 --> 00:07:30,983
Bye-bye, cop!

96
00:07:32,857 --> 00:07:36,623
Sorry, baby. But it's time
you take your medicine.

97
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:51,073
Dang. Always pulls to the right.

98
00:08:01,558 --> 00:08:03,686
Dad, what's wrong? Oh, my God.

99
00:08:03,894 --> 00:08:05,589
lt's a cramp!

100
00:08:15,074 --> 00:08:16,871
Officer down.

101
00:08:17,577 --> 00:08:21,537
These stairs are killing me, honey.
We may have to move.

102
00:08:21,915 --> 00:08:24,612
But, Dad, there's only four steps.

103
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:28,155
All right, if you love it here...

104
00:08:28,723 --> 00:08:30,282
...l'll build a ramp.

105
00:08:40,304 --> 00:08:45,264
lt's been three hours since lunch
and we're still cleaning up this egg.

106
00:08:45,476 --> 00:08:48,878
Man, would you look at all that gunk.

107
00:08:49,081 --> 00:08:50,070
Seriously.

108
00:08:50,282 --> 00:08:54,151
Does he roll his food
on the ground before he eats it?

109
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:59,855
We need to send a letter to the mayor
about washing our hands before we eat.

110
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,367
Like he's going to listen to us.

111
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,432
Hey, cells vote, man.

112
00:09:10,706 --> 00:09:12,197
Cells vote.

113
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:27,416
Got you, you little....

114
00:09:32,132 --> 00:09:33,430
Artie?

115
00:09:34,335 --> 00:09:36,462
What's going on over there?

116
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:09,472
Holy spit.

117
00:10:12,514 --> 00:10:15,176
Careful, l'm contagious.

118
00:10:34,406 --> 00:10:35,464
l don't like!

119
00:10:50,158 --> 00:10:52,525
l'll turn up the heat in here.

120
00:11:09,748 --> 00:11:12,148
Connecting, please hold.
One moment.

121
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:13,440
Now connecting.

122
00:11:13,653 --> 00:11:17,919
Mr. Mayor, how will you deal
with the fat-cell housing shortage?

123
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:22,888
l'd like to announce we're beginning
construction on a third chin.

124
00:11:23,097 --> 00:11:24,998
We're having jock itch!

125
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,599
Any comments on today's cramp?

126
00:11:26,802 --> 00:11:30,398
What about the hair cells
laid off from the scalp?

127
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,474
There'll be plenty of new jobs
on the back.

128
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,338
What about the request
for better nutrition?

129
00:11:37,548 --> 00:11:41,485
85% of red blood cell children
don't know how to carry oxygen.

130
00:11:41,686 --> 00:11:44,382
People, people you worry too much.

131
00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:47,081
The body is in perfect shape.

132
00:11:50,931 --> 00:11:53,024
No more questions. Thank you.

133
00:11:56,871 --> 00:11:58,634
Do they know l work hard?

134
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,966
Nobody cares.

135
00:12:00,174 --> 00:12:02,803
- Mr. Mayor--
- Leah, l've got a body to run.

136
00:12:03,012 --> 00:12:06,972
- l've got Tom Colonic's new ad.
- Let's go, put it on.

137
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:11,718
This is a paid announcement.

138
00:12:14,158 --> 00:12:16,992
The bowels didn't always
smell this way.

139
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,755
Eating right and exercise...

140
00:12:19,965 --> 00:12:22,730
...kept this area
a center ofactivity.

141
00:12:22,935 --> 00:12:26,393
But during Phlemming's term,
rot and stagnation...

142
00:12:26,606 --> 00:12:28,370
...paralyzed this neighborhood...

143
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:31,305
...the colon, and the sphincter.

144
00:12:31,512 --> 00:12:34,414
It's time we get things moving again.

145
00:12:34,616 --> 00:12:38,053
I'm Tom Colonic.
As mayor, I'd set long-term goals...

146
00:12:38,254 --> 00:12:41,246
...that include salads
and eating bran.

147
00:12:41,457 --> 00:12:45,895
Mayor Phlemming may think
things are fiine the way they are.

148
00:12:46,229 --> 00:12:50,792
But if we pull together
andput in a little hard work...

149
00:12:51,002 --> 00:12:55,337
...a new Frank could be
right around the corner.

150
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,107
Mr. Colonic? What's that smell?

151
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:01,976
That's the smell ofchange, Billy.

152
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,045
The smell ofchange.

153
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,609
Paid by Colonic for Mayor.

154
00:13:07,822 --> 00:13:10,257
Can you believe those lies?

155
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:15,124
He's got a point. You promised
to focus on health issues.

156
00:13:15,331 --> 00:13:16,457
l want health...

157
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:20,933
...but think of the sacrifices,
the hard work and lack of chips.

158
00:13:21,238 --> 00:13:23,263
That's not what voters want.

159
00:13:23,474 --> 00:13:26,911
- Why are you behind in the polls?
- Don't you worry.

160
00:13:27,112 --> 00:13:30,479
l have a plan to flush Colonic
down the toilet.

161
00:13:31,617 --> 00:13:32,982
Honey.

162
00:13:34,987 --> 00:13:36,546
Shane.

163
00:13:38,325 --> 00:13:39,724
Coming!

164
00:13:41,094 --> 00:13:43,563
You okay? Where does it hurt?

165
00:13:44,732 --> 00:13:45,721
Leg.

166
00:13:46,134 --> 00:13:47,432
ls it here?

167
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:48,965
A leg.

168
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:51,138
Here?

169
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,400
Leg.

170
00:13:58,015 --> 00:13:59,141
Here.

171
00:14:04,122 --> 00:14:05,885
l just needed some sodium.

172
00:14:06,191 --> 00:14:08,422
That's what made me cramp up.

173
00:14:12,165 --> 00:14:13,155
Heads up!

174
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:16,495
Chicken going down rough.
Going down rough.

175
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,802
Oh, now what?

176
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:24,208
Sir, turn on the optical feed.

177
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,542
Let me take a look, Dad.

178
00:14:29,886 --> 00:14:30,875
Open wide.

179
00:14:31,555 --> 00:14:33,216
Open wide.

180
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:37,785
Could you swallow first, please?

181
00:14:45,238 --> 00:14:46,899
Definitely red.

182
00:14:50,511 --> 00:14:52,342
Are you ordering out?

183
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,479
l'm making an appointment
with the doctor.

184
00:14:55,684 --> 00:14:59,882
Sick? We're not getting sick!
We have far too much planned.

185
00:15:07,064 --> 00:15:11,023
You can't override without
a vote from city council.

186
00:15:11,903 --> 00:15:13,564
Yes, my dear.

187
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,701
Voice manual control on.

188
00:15:17,943 --> 00:15:22,313
- That's only for emergencies.
- Leah, this is an emergency.

189
00:15:22,516 --> 00:15:24,074
On second thought...

190
00:15:24,284 --> 00:15:26,013
On second thought...

191
00:15:26,219 --> 00:15:29,883
- ...I'll take a coldpill.
- ...l'll take a cold pill.

192
00:15:33,462 --> 00:15:34,929
Uh, sir?

193
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:38,589
Thank you. Get me the chief.
There's a good girl.

194
00:15:46,877 --> 00:15:48,402
''Drixenol.''

195
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:00,282
Next.

196
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:03,725
l caught him with six micrograms
of adrenaline.

197
00:16:03,931 --> 00:16:06,662
lt's not mine.
l swear, it's my cousin's.

198
00:16:06,868 --> 00:16:11,932
Yeah, l never heard that one before.
Take him to lockdown. Next.

199
00:16:14,076 --> 00:16:15,635
Hey, it's ''the Germinator!''

200
00:16:17,547 --> 00:16:20,847
You got me there.
Save some for the criminals.

201
00:16:21,052 --> 00:16:25,319
- You never catch anything, Jones.
- You should've seen this thing.

202
00:16:25,524 --> 00:16:27,492
lt's no ordinary germ.

203
00:16:27,693 --> 00:16:30,629
This thing ain't even
from Frank's body.

204
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:34,095
This is like a Al Roker germ,
a Heavy D germ.

205
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:36,596
Talking about this?

206
00:16:39,473 --> 00:16:43,035
Yeah, he's slouching right now.

207
00:16:43,244 --> 00:16:44,541
ln my office!

208
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:49,712
- Chiefy-weefy, what's up?
- Don't ''chiefy-weefy'' me.

209
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,147
See the headlines?

210
00:16:51,354 --> 00:16:56,156
The papers call it the most powerful
cramp since Shane made us try Tae Bo!

211
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,092
- Hold on a second.
- l told you to wait for backup!

212
00:17:00,298 --> 00:17:03,393
But again, you had to
do it your own way.

213
00:17:03,602 --> 00:17:05,467
- Man, l could have--
- Right!

214
00:17:05,671 --> 00:17:08,266
Trillions of cells
working together...

215
00:17:08,475 --> 00:17:11,035
...you're the only one doing it alone.

216
00:17:11,244 --> 00:17:13,406
That's your problem, Jones.

217
00:17:13,614 --> 00:17:17,675
What?! Oh, hello, Mr. Mayor.
The missus? She's great, yes.

218
00:17:17,885 --> 00:17:20,252
What? l'll put a man right on it.

219
00:17:20,455 --> 00:17:23,323
Yes, sir.
Stupid political decisions.

220
00:17:23,526 --> 00:17:24,686
Now where was l?

221
00:17:24,894 --> 00:17:27,260
You said you were giving me...

222
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,456
...a promotion to
Head of Brain Security.

223
00:17:30,668 --> 00:17:35,504
You know what? You're right.
Maybe it is time l give you a case.

224
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,271
Talking about what?

225
00:17:37,475 --> 00:17:39,967
l'm putting you on a job
in the throat.

226
00:17:40,546 --> 00:17:44,813
Thank you, chief. Thank you, chief.
You won't regret this.

227
00:17:45,018 --> 00:17:47,987
You a good man.
You a upstanding man.

228
00:17:48,188 --> 00:17:51,454
- Whatever.
- lt was on the fence for a while.

229
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:56,097
''Good man, bad man.''
Now it's official: You are a good man.

230
00:17:56,465 --> 00:18:00,368
You done? Now our pill
is getting swallowed as we speak.

231
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,937
So get your nucleus
down to the stomach, pronto.

232
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:05,869
Pill? What pill?

233
00:18:06,077 --> 00:18:09,774
l wouldn't trust you to
handle a sore throat alone!

234
00:18:10,147 --> 00:18:14,676
Get out. Or you're on butt-hair
patrol for the next three years!

235
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:27,734
Rinky-dink, stink, pinky pill.

236
00:18:29,137 --> 00:18:33,074
The white zone is for ingestion and
digestion only. No parking.

237
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:36,835
Peanut boarding
for intestine and liver...

238
00:18:38,248 --> 00:18:40,546
... with direct service
to the colon.

239
00:18:40,784 --> 00:18:42,217
Now boarding.

240
00:18:44,155 --> 00:18:47,647
Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna....

241
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,325
All right.

242
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:59,301
All fat cells
proceed to love handles.

243
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,275
Oh, yes, Mr. Mayor.

244
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,503
No, sir, it hasn't arrived yet.

245
00:19:05,714 --> 00:19:09,811
What the--
Look out now.

246
00:19:14,056 --> 00:19:17,424
Did you look at my notes
on your speech?

247
00:19:17,628 --> 00:19:18,890
The in-box.

248
00:19:19,096 --> 00:19:22,931
Yes, it says ''in'' on it, sir.
l'll check back later.

249
00:19:23,134 --> 00:19:24,624
All right, goodbye.

250
00:19:24,837 --> 00:19:29,433
Well, well, what do we have here?
Somebody been working out!

251
00:19:29,642 --> 00:19:32,134
Leah, you looking fine.
Mighty fine.

252
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:35,747
Did they have to assign you to this?

253
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,113
Spit. Wasn't my idea,
but now l like it.

254
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,221
Baby, when are we hooking up?

255
00:19:41,423 --> 00:19:44,950
l know a spot behind the eye,
has a perfect view.

256
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,325
Perfect for a little rendezvous
between me and you.

257
00:19:49,532 --> 00:19:53,936
Do you know what l'm saying?
l been saying it a long time.

258
00:19:54,138 --> 00:19:57,006
Why would l ever go out with you?

259
00:19:57,209 --> 00:20:01,236
What? l'm a legend!
The chicks line up to divide with me.

260
00:20:01,446 --> 00:20:02,539
Oh, really?

261
00:20:02,748 --> 00:20:06,047
You look like a cell
who divides with himself.

262
00:20:07,087 --> 00:20:10,682
Who cut off the heat?
Somebody pay the bill! lt's cold.

263
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:15,920
Now arriving with some milk, a cold
pill with a pleasant fruity flavor.

264
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:21,363
Wow, this is huge.

265
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,938
Don't be all impressed.
lt's 99% sugar.

266
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,837
Yeah? And 99% of you is just stupid.

267
00:20:28,044 --> 00:20:30,946
Like l haven't heard that one before.

268
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,922
What is that cherry stank?

269
00:20:44,365 --> 00:20:48,096
Special agent
Drixobenzometaphedramine.

270
00:20:50,071 --> 00:20:53,199
''The brand that eases
your coughs and sneezes.''

271
00:20:53,408 --> 00:20:56,810
Don't exceed dosage.
lf symptoms persist, see a physician.

272
00:20:57,013 --> 00:20:59,208
May cause drowsiness.
Do not operate machinery.

273
00:20:59,415 --> 00:21:02,010
Pregnant women shouldn't handle pills.

274
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,652
l feel better already.

275
00:21:03,854 --> 00:21:07,018
- You can call me ''Drix.''
- Welcome to Frank.

276
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:09,750
l'll examine your irritated areas.

277
00:21:09,961 --> 00:21:12,089
Never on the first date, Drips.

278
00:21:12,298 --> 00:21:13,788
- Drix.
- l said that.

279
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:17,527
- You said ''Drips'' with a ''p.''
- Whatever.

280
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:23,169
This ain't working. l'll ask
the chief to assign someone else.

281
00:21:23,377 --> 00:21:24,366
Wait.

282
00:21:24,745 --> 00:21:27,146
Hold up. l need this job, Leah.

283
00:21:27,349 --> 00:21:29,408
Just give me a shot.

284
00:21:30,786 --> 00:21:34,985
All right. But no screw-ups, you dig?

285
00:21:35,191 --> 00:21:39,754
l promise everything will be fine.
Not as fine as you, but fine.

286
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,358
Man, what you been eating?

287
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,003
That's my effervescent propulsion.

288
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,438
We're driving with the windows open.

289
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,842
l don't want bubbles
stinking up my ride.

290
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:56,276
You got that?

291
00:21:58,686 --> 00:22:01,120
Look what you're doing to my baby.

292
00:22:02,824 --> 00:22:04,918
Don't touch my radio!

293
00:22:09,065 --> 00:22:10,464
Where you from?

294
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:14,160
The University of Chicago,
graduated Phi Beta Capsule.

295
00:22:14,372 --> 00:22:17,136
Great, got me a college boy.

296
00:22:17,341 --> 00:22:19,742
FDA-certified for colds and flu...

297
00:22:19,945 --> 00:22:23,745
...and a master's in Symptom Relief.
Where'd you study?

298
00:22:23,949 --> 00:22:28,853
l grew up on the wrong side of the
digestive tract. No fancy schools.

299
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,154
My high school was crack central.

300
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:37,361
No, it was in the crack!
Right in the stanky puckered center!

301
00:22:39,768 --> 00:22:43,261
We lived on peanut butter
and cellulite sandwiches.

302
00:22:43,472 --> 00:22:45,941
Ever blow-dry your hair with a fart?

303
00:22:46,143 --> 00:22:48,407
- Okay, you were poor.
- You bet!

304
00:22:48,612 --> 00:22:51,912
Ever make a snowman from paper
cling-ons? That's poor!

305
00:22:52,116 --> 00:22:53,777
You'll make me vomit.

306
00:22:53,985 --> 00:22:57,319
We couldn't afford vomit,
that's for rich folks.

307
00:22:57,523 --> 00:23:00,981
- I have to wipe my eyes.
- Wanna talk about wiping?

308
00:23:04,697 --> 00:23:08,566
You're all new so follow my lead,
all right?

309
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:13,639
Wait up! Didn't they teach you
manners in that lvy League petri dish?

310
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:18,473
Murphy, it's flaring up again!
Give me a status on the pain relief.

311
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:21,645
Foreign substance in upper....

312
00:23:21,851 --> 00:23:26,084
lnflammation and glandular swelling.
We meet again.

313
00:23:28,626 --> 00:23:30,821
Dougy-Doug, the firebug!

314
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:32,496
My boy is hot!

315
00:23:32,697 --> 00:23:36,190
Osmosis Jones.
Like l don't have enough problems?

316
00:23:36,402 --> 00:23:38,871
Start redirecting traffic over there.

317
00:23:39,072 --> 00:23:42,098
l'm in charge of this
sore throat, baby.

318
00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:45,643
- You're kidding me.
- No. Straight up. What we got?

319
00:23:45,847 --> 00:23:47,781
lt's a routine sore throat.

320
00:23:47,982 --> 00:23:51,384
Looks like a saliva boat
went haywire and crashed.

321
00:23:51,587 --> 00:23:54,113
Saliva boat? That's pretty unusual.

322
00:23:54,324 --> 00:23:56,792
lKnock down that hot spot, ladder team!

323
00:23:58,728 --> 00:23:59,718
Step away.

324
00:24:00,464 --> 00:24:04,195
The tamperproof seal is there
for your protection.

325
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:51,716
Not my suedes!

326
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:57,730
What the dilly?

327
00:25:16,955 --> 00:25:18,753
Por favor, don't shoot!

328
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:22,587
La Muerte man esta aqui!

329
00:25:22,795 --> 00:25:24,423
He'll kill us, hombre!

330
00:25:24,631 --> 00:25:27,828
Talk English, man.
We ain't on Telemundo here.

331
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:32,301
La Muerte Roja!
He's coming, man. l saw him.

332
00:25:32,506 --> 00:25:35,408
l saw him. l saw him!
La Muerte Roja--

333
00:25:36,445 --> 00:25:40,405
When your body's full ofaches
A Drixenol is all it takes

334
00:25:40,617 --> 00:25:43,279
Excuse me! What are you doing?

335
00:25:43,486 --> 00:25:45,478
l'm soothing the irritation.

336
00:25:45,823 --> 00:25:49,122
You just soothed my witness
into a germ-cicle.

337
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:53,859
Don't worry, he'll be normal
in a few days.

338
00:25:54,065 --> 00:25:55,498
That's too late.

339
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:58,499
He has information on what went down.

340
00:25:58,704 --> 00:26:01,936
Nothing ''went down.''
lt's a common sore throat.

341
00:26:02,142 --> 00:26:04,337
This is a crime scene.

342
00:26:09,017 --> 00:26:12,818
Want to be useful? Plug some
Turtle Wax into that thing...

343
00:26:13,022 --> 00:26:14,887
...and wash my car!

344
00:26:16,592 --> 00:26:19,426
Now that's inflammation relief.

345
00:26:19,629 --> 00:26:21,119
Later, Doug.

346
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:23,323
Be cool, Oz.

347
00:26:31,276 --> 00:26:35,543
How's it feel working with
the two dumbest animals in the zoo?

348
00:26:37,417 --> 00:26:38,851
- Not bad.
- lt's okay.

349
00:26:39,053 --> 00:26:41,453
l'm talking to the camels.

350
00:26:45,593 --> 00:26:47,959
They're talking to the camels.

351
00:26:48,664 --> 00:26:50,222
Excellent.

352
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:55,838
l'm so psyched for this long weekend.

353
00:26:56,273 --> 00:26:57,706
Getting out of town?

354
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:01,003
l'm not getting out of my bathrobe.

355
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:06,240
l'll get a keg and plop myself down
on the sofa in front of the TV.

356
00:27:06,452 --> 00:27:09,216
Some quality time
with the wife and kids.

357
00:27:12,192 --> 00:27:13,750
What's that smell?

358
00:27:14,127 --> 00:27:17,791
That's Bruno. His tummy's still upset.

359
00:27:18,265 --> 00:27:22,965
No, l'm talking about that
nasty, skanky, sweaty smell.

360
00:27:23,405 --> 00:27:26,375
Shane won't buy me deodorant anymore.

361
00:27:26,576 --> 00:27:28,806
She says it causes cancer.

362
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:44,294
Did the foot fungus pay up yet?

363
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:47,126
No, that guy's getting flaky on us.

364
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:52,034
You ain't going to collect
nothing from him up here in the pit.

365
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,971
Now get down there,
send him a message.

366
00:28:00,682 --> 00:28:06,019
So, this is where the scum of Frank
comes to fester.

367
00:28:06,222 --> 00:28:11,354
Hey, you lost, pal? This is
a private sweat gland. Now beat it!

368
00:28:11,562 --> 00:28:16,125
l'm looking for volunteers. Some
germs who want in on a big score.

369
00:28:17,402 --> 00:28:22,431
Yo, Red, we run the rackets here.
Take your hustle someplace else.

370
00:28:22,642 --> 00:28:24,770
This ain't about no hustle.

371
00:28:24,978 --> 00:28:27,947
This is about the baddest illness
you've ever seen.

372
00:28:28,148 --> 00:28:31,209
Look who thinks he's
the Ebola virus, huh?

373
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:35,557
Ebola?

374
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:38,889
Let me tell you something
about Ebola, baby.

375
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:43,395
Ebola is a case of dandruff
compared to me!

376
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,297
All right, pal. You're out of here.

377
00:28:46,504 --> 00:28:50,498
Bruiser, take him to the face
and bury him in a blackhead.

378
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:55,204
lt'll take a Swedish facialist
and six steaming washcloths...

379
00:28:55,415 --> 00:28:56,848
...to get you out!

380
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:00,019
Sounds like a gas, baby. Bring it on.

381
00:29:06,461 --> 00:29:09,225
Bruiser! What are you? A sissy Mary?

382
00:29:09,631 --> 00:29:10,825
What are you doing?

383
00:29:11,033 --> 00:29:13,001
Che fa? What's he doing?

384
00:29:22,614 --> 00:29:26,573
You ain't so tough, huh?
That was nothing.

385
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,485
So, uh...

386
00:29:29,688 --> 00:29:32,556
...what kind of sickness
do you have in mind...

387
00:29:32,826 --> 00:29:35,989
- ...boss?
- Deadly.

388
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,392
Hey, Dad.
Hey, Uncle Bob.

389
00:29:42,203 --> 00:29:43,603
Hello, beautiful.

390
00:29:43,805 --> 00:29:46,535
l stopped by the camping store...

391
00:29:46,742 --> 00:29:49,541
...and l got some stuff for the hike.

392
00:29:50,446 --> 00:29:55,783
Right. On this hike, is that
teacher of yours going to be there?

393
00:29:57,288 --> 00:29:59,587
Yeah, my whole class is.
Why?

394
00:30:00,191 --> 00:30:03,217
l was thinking l might
take a rain check.

395
00:30:04,263 --> 00:30:06,959
Mrs. Boyd isn't still mad at you.

396
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,032
l didn't think so.
We could do something better.

397
00:30:12,406 --> 00:30:16,776
Yesterday, without thinking,
l did all my hiking for the week.

398
00:30:16,978 --> 00:30:20,676
l hiked to the liquor store,
the cigarette warehouse....

399
00:30:20,883 --> 00:30:24,216
- But, Dad, you said--
- l said l'd think about it.

400
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,152
lt's a holiday weekend.
lt's important to be together.

401
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,824
Yeah, l guess you're right.

402
00:30:34,031 --> 00:30:38,560
Well, l have something special
up my sleeve.

403
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:45,304
Have you ever seen a rattlesnake
swallow a football?

404
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,104
l don't think she has.

405
00:30:47,314 --> 00:30:48,781
lt's fun. Come on.

406
00:30:48,983 --> 00:30:53,284
- Come on. l'll show you.
- Thank you, Uncle Bob.

407
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:56,519
You're gonna love it!

408
00:31:01,197 --> 00:31:03,132
Why are we wasting time here?

409
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:06,325
l am on a 1 2-hour
time release program.

410
00:31:06,536 --> 00:31:10,098
- Throat, nose, then aches and pains.
- l got it.

411
00:31:10,308 --> 00:31:13,176
Real important stuff.
Wait in the car.

412
00:31:13,379 --> 00:31:15,779
l got police work to do.

413
00:31:15,981 --> 00:31:19,281
One glazed and one
with a jelly-filled nucleus.

414
00:31:21,388 --> 00:31:23,619
Brain memory library.

415
00:31:23,824 --> 00:31:26,918
You got any information
on something called...

416
00:31:27,128 --> 00:31:29,495
- ... ''El Morry Roho''?
- Stand by.

417
00:31:29,698 --> 00:31:33,931
l'll check, but we're really
all about sports statistics here.

418
00:31:37,006 --> 00:31:38,371
- Sir?
- l'm here.

419
00:31:38,574 --> 00:31:41,635
- What you got?
- ''La Muerte Roja'' is Spanish.

420
00:31:41,845 --> 00:31:44,815
- It means ''The Red Death.''
- The Red Death?

421
00:31:45,016 --> 00:31:48,508
- ls that some taco sauce?
- You have a nice day.

422
00:31:55,028 --> 00:31:56,723
Yo, Drips!

423
00:31:58,498 --> 00:32:00,899
You ever hear of The Red Death?

424
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,339
Look alive, boys.
Dust at nine o'clock.

425
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,687
Eat hot nose juice, dust.

426
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:03,073
- We're here. You happy?
- Hear that?

427
00:33:03,308 --> 00:33:05,504
Quick! The dam is under attack!

428
00:33:05,712 --> 00:33:07,509
Hey, chill, pill!

429
00:33:07,714 --> 00:33:10,479
Snot guns are booger-coating
some dust.

430
00:33:26,103 --> 00:33:29,231
Now, get to work!

431
00:33:29,506 --> 00:33:33,409
This is your big plan?
A sore throat? A stuffy nose?

432
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:36,809
- People will think you're--
- A common cold.

433
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:41,215
Until l make my move,
that's precisely what l want.

434
00:33:41,421 --> 00:33:44,049
Yo, check it out. We got cops here!

435
00:33:44,257 --> 00:33:45,417
Hey, look.

436
00:33:46,327 --> 00:33:51,231
Be careful! That's a pollen pod.
Frank is allergic to this stuff.

437
00:33:51,433 --> 00:33:54,732
- l didn't know he had allergies.
- Of course not.

438
00:33:56,306 --> 00:33:59,605
Pills know nothing
about what goes on in here.

439
00:34:02,046 --> 00:34:05,777
ln the words of the immortal
James Brown, get down!

440
00:34:05,983 --> 00:34:07,042
James who?

441
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:24,268
- Hey, Frank.
- Danny.

442
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:28,066
Nitwit!

443
00:34:28,277 --> 00:34:30,268
You could've damaged the dam!

444
00:34:30,479 --> 00:34:34,678
Relax, this baby was built to last.
Solid cartilage.

445
00:34:34,885 --> 00:34:39,016
You're an engineer now.
l need to test the mucous viscosity.

446
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,284
Frank! Why are you leaving so early?

447
00:34:44,496 --> 00:34:49,491
lt's all shoveled. Hippo's asleep.
l'm taking Shane to Docky's.

448
00:34:49,702 --> 00:34:53,263
- Did you think of something?
- Yeah, l did great.

449
00:34:54,942 --> 00:34:58,935
l guarantee you there ain't
nothing wrong with this dam.

450
00:34:59,513 --> 00:35:02,711
So you want me to take care of them?

451
00:35:02,918 --> 00:35:07,618
No. Hit all the pressure valves.
They're about to blow the scene.

452
00:35:14,865 --> 00:35:18,632
What in the name of sweet
bleeding Frank?!

453
00:35:18,836 --> 00:35:21,863
The membrane is cracking, you--

454
00:35:48,572 --> 00:35:51,769
- You missed a spot!
- Come on, fellas. Go!

455
00:35:51,976 --> 00:35:54,275
- Let's get out of here!
- Stop!

456
00:35:54,479 --> 00:35:55,639
lmmunity!

457
00:35:55,847 --> 00:35:57,144
What the Frank?

458
00:36:01,821 --> 00:36:03,380
Wait a minute!

459
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,550
Nose hairs!

460
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:34,489
Watch out!

461
00:36:37,897 --> 00:36:39,262
Look out!

462
00:36:44,638 --> 00:36:46,504
We're going to die!

463
00:36:49,711 --> 00:36:52,772
l'm standing here.
Can you use a tissue?

464
00:36:52,982 --> 00:36:56,009
- l don't have one.
- Use your imagination.

465
00:36:56,253 --> 00:36:57,720
What's that there?

466
00:37:03,728 --> 00:37:04,729
- Better?
- Much better.

467
00:37:04,729 --> 00:37:05,161
- Better?
- Much better.

468
00:37:05,363 --> 00:37:09,425
l gotta go get her. She'll be
excited and probably call you.

469
00:37:11,805 --> 00:37:15,241
lf not for you, none of this
would have ever happened.

470
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:17,206
lf you'll excuse me, l...

471
00:37:17,411 --> 00:37:19,572
...have a nose to dry.

472
00:37:23,218 --> 00:37:26,619
This is Nerve Network News. NNN.

473
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:34,864
ln an act of selfless bravery,
a cold tablet stopped a runny nose.

474
00:37:35,065 --> 00:37:38,968
The heroic tablet will be
honored this afternoon.

475
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:40,398
Trudy?

476
00:37:40,605 --> 00:37:44,940
ln lighter news, there was pandemonium
in the stomach today...

477
00:37:45,144 --> 00:37:46,941
...as animal crackers arrived.

478
00:37:47,146 --> 00:37:49,445
They are adorable, aren't they?

479
00:37:49,749 --> 00:37:54,710
Now, we go live to Cerebellum Hall for
an address from Mayor Phlegmming.

480
00:37:54,922 --> 00:37:56,389
Okay, Mayor.

481
00:37:56,591 --> 00:37:59,720
ln five, four, three....

482
00:38:00,462 --> 00:38:04,490
Good evening, citizens of Frank.
ln the past few weeks...

483
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:09,297
...my opponent has used fancy words
to try to confuse the issues.

484
00:38:09,506 --> 00:38:14,103
Words like ''exercise,''
''low-fat,'' and ''diet.''

485
00:38:14,345 --> 00:38:19,682
Words designed to scare us into
changing what has worked for years.

486
00:38:19,951 --> 00:38:24,013
Well, l say let's stay the course.

487
00:38:24,223 --> 00:38:27,591
Remember, a fat Frank
is a happy Frank.

488
00:38:27,794 --> 00:38:29,625
That's not what l wrote.

489
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:34,131
l propose something that every
organism in this city will enjoy.

490
00:38:34,335 --> 00:38:35,893
l give you...

491
00:38:36,104 --> 00:38:40,508
...a dream vacation to
the annual chicken wing festival...

492
00:38:40,709 --> 00:38:42,575
...in Buffalo, New York.

493
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:51,453
Final plans have been made and nothing
is going to stand in our way.

494
00:38:52,491 --> 00:38:53,822
And we're out.

495
00:38:55,260 --> 00:39:00,164
- That wasn't the speech we agreed on.
- Where's the twerp in the wheelchair?

496
00:39:00,366 --> 00:39:02,334
Hello, Johnny. How you doing?

497
00:39:02,836 --> 00:39:07,330
Congratulations. Excellent work
in the nose. Let's get some pictures.

498
00:39:08,076 --> 00:39:11,944
The caption should read,
''Mayor and Pill Stop Cold...Cold.''

499
00:39:12,147 --> 00:39:16,949
Mr. Mayor? Excuse me, sir,
but we have a problem.

500
00:39:17,386 --> 00:39:18,513
Now what, Jones?

501
00:39:18,722 --> 00:39:22,419
Whatever was in the sinuses
is a lot more than a cold.

502
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:26,927
Don't listen to Jones. His diagnostic
skills are remedial at best!

503
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:30,033
You iced a key witness
to a viral attack!

504
00:39:30,236 --> 00:39:31,498
lt was an accident!

505
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:34,640
The kind a time-release dipstick
would have.

506
00:39:34,841 --> 00:39:38,538
l am sick of you!
That's it, l can't work with him!

507
00:39:38,745 --> 00:39:40,771
l can't work with you!

508
00:39:40,982 --> 00:39:42,381
Officers, please.

509
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:47,521
- Jones, what's this virus?
- The virus that torched the throat.

510
00:39:47,723 --> 00:39:50,557
lt caused those snot crests
l was surfing!

511
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,457
They were caused by the sneeze,
which you caused.

512
00:39:54,664 --> 00:39:58,157
Then why was that
viral-looking mother fleeing?

513
00:39:58,936 --> 00:40:01,428
We should put the city on full alert.

514
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,701
- Liquids, bed rest. Just to be safe.
- We'll do no such thing.

515
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:11,350
l won't listen to the white blood cell
with the worst record in Frank.

516
00:40:11,551 --> 00:40:14,714
lKeep those opinions
in that mushy head...

517
00:40:14,921 --> 00:40:19,222
...or you'll find yourself
in our next nosebleed. Understood?

518
00:40:20,595 --> 00:40:22,757
Son, l apologize for all this.

519
00:40:22,965 --> 00:40:26,230
Now, why don't we find you
another...

520
00:40:26,435 --> 00:40:27,733
...more capable officer to work with.

521
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:31,868
Sir, if it's all the same to you...

522
00:40:32,073 --> 00:40:34,372
...l think l'll stay with Jones.

523
00:40:39,582 --> 00:40:41,106
Suit yourself.

524
00:40:45,155 --> 00:40:48,956
You didn't have to do that.
l don't need your sympathy.

525
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,650
lt's not sympathy.

526
00:40:50,862 --> 00:40:54,822
l'm here to make Frank feel better.
lf this alleged virus...

527
00:40:55,034 --> 00:40:57,525
...impedes my mission,
l must pursue it.

528
00:40:57,737 --> 00:41:00,002
Yeah, whatever.

529
00:41:01,642 --> 00:41:04,703
What did the mayor mean by ''record''?

530
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,674
You did something terrible,
didn't you?

531
00:41:09,485 --> 00:41:12,750
Sometimes being too careful
is all it takes.

532
00:41:12,955 --> 00:41:13,944
How so?

533
00:41:14,156 --> 00:41:18,719
l was cruising the digestive tract,
just minding my own business.

534
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:24,160
Outside was Shane's science fair.
Everyone was excited.

535
00:41:24,368 --> 00:41:28,328
The winner would get their picture
in the localpaper.

536
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:33,877
- Think they'll like my volcano?
- All the parents are going home sad.

537
00:41:34,647 --> 00:41:38,982
Their kids' projects are cardboard
and glitter paint and science.

538
00:41:39,186 --> 00:41:41,121
Shane, yours is art.

539
00:41:41,756 --> 00:41:45,021
- Wow, what a great tepee.
- Tepee?

540
00:41:45,293 --> 00:41:47,694
Mrs. Delirious, come on.

541
00:41:48,598 --> 00:41:53,298
l'll check the competition. Try and
learn them something about volcanos.

542
00:41:58,276 --> 00:42:00,267
Partner, what you got there?

543
00:42:00,478 --> 00:42:04,779
These are polluted oysters.
Well, they were polluted.

544
00:42:04,984 --> 00:42:09,581
l replanted them six months ago.
That's how long the state says.

545
00:42:09,789 --> 00:42:12,622
Every time the tide came in,
they'd flush...

546
00:42:12,827 --> 00:42:14,624
...all the bad stuff out.

547
00:42:15,496 --> 00:42:17,396
Can you eat them?

548
00:42:17,865 --> 00:42:21,666
Well, if my hypotenuse is correct,
sure.

549
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:24,906
Yeah, definitely.

550
00:42:25,608 --> 00:42:27,337
You got yourself a sale.

551
00:42:39,892 --> 00:42:42,861
You should check your math
on that one.

552
00:42:44,998 --> 00:42:48,593
I was in the kidneys
while a 6-31 was in progress.

553
00:42:48,802 --> 00:42:52,933
That's incoming shellfiish.
I went to the stomach, to be safe.

554
00:42:53,141 --> 00:42:56,509
Unscheduled shellfiish
now arriving at gate six.

555
00:42:57,179 --> 00:42:59,670
And you must be Shane's dad.

556
00:42:59,882 --> 00:43:02,443
Guilty as charged. Frank Detorre.

557
00:43:02,652 --> 00:43:05,246
Pleasure to meet you.
l am Mrs. Boyd.

558
00:43:05,455 --> 00:43:08,118
l am Shane's science and PE teacher.

559
00:43:08,325 --> 00:43:11,989
l am just absolutely crazy
about your daughter.

560
00:43:12,197 --> 00:43:13,289
She is a doll.

561
00:43:13,498 --> 00:43:16,297
lf you mean that, l'll keep her.

562
00:43:23,677 --> 00:43:25,542
Oh, my God.

563
00:43:27,415 --> 00:43:29,883
That is so funny!

564
00:43:30,552 --> 00:43:33,488
Oh, my God, l got the giggles.

565
00:43:35,091 --> 00:43:36,820
She's a sweetie-pie.

566
00:43:37,093 --> 00:43:41,690
She wants to go to the city
and help people someday.

567
00:43:42,065 --> 00:43:45,502
No kidding.
You mean like a concierge?

568
00:43:45,703 --> 00:43:48,332
No, like, poor people.

569
00:43:49,174 --> 00:43:50,903
Yeah, she told me that.

570
00:43:51,643 --> 00:43:55,444
Frank, it's so wonderful to see...

571
00:43:55,648 --> 00:43:58,675
...Shane participating
in the science fair.

572
00:43:58,953 --> 00:44:03,447
Since her mother passed away,
she's had a really hard time...

573
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:06,285
...being part of the group activities.

574
00:44:06,762 --> 00:44:08,787
She's going to be okay.

575
00:44:13,803 --> 00:44:15,294
And then I saw him.

576
00:44:16,406 --> 00:44:19,398
He was on the clammiest oyster
l'd ever seen.

577
00:44:22,747 --> 00:44:24,112
Mr. Detorre?

578
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,276
Are you okay?

579
00:44:32,292 --> 00:44:33,725
Those oysters.

580
00:44:34,494 --> 00:44:38,454
The oysters?
Oh, yeah, that's Zach's project.

581
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,966
He's a little slow.

582
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:45,239
The doctor says he has a brain
the size of a tangerine.

583
00:44:47,377 --> 00:44:50,778
We gave him this project
to push him along.

584
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:54,314
He just started it this morning,
which is funny.

585
00:44:55,152 --> 00:44:56,855
We'll give him an 'A' anyway.

586
00:44:56,855 --> 00:44:57,514
We'll give him an 'A' anyway.

587
00:44:58,123 --> 00:44:59,112
Mr. Detorre?

588
00:45:06,866 --> 00:45:10,803
There was no time for questions.
I did what I had to do.

589
00:45:11,438 --> 00:45:13,600
Look at that guy!

590
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:27,923
You can guess which photo
made it to the paper the next day.

591
00:45:28,124 --> 00:45:31,253
Overnight, Frank became
the town laughingstock.

592
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:35,593
The photo ran in every daily
across the country.

593
00:45:35,801 --> 00:45:39,101
He got fiired from his job
at the pea soup factory.

594
00:45:39,305 --> 00:45:43,264
Lucky for us, Bob hooked up
Frank with ajob at the zoo.

595
00:45:43,476 --> 00:45:48,039
It was a 90% cut in pay,
but it was the best we could do.

596
00:45:48,249 --> 00:45:51,777
Needless to say,
none of this helped Shane.

597
00:45:52,087 --> 00:45:55,956
And as for me, l got suspended
for unnecessary force.

598
00:45:56,158 --> 00:45:59,025
Since then, every day l wonder:

599
00:45:59,228 --> 00:46:01,322
''Did l do the right thing?''

600
00:46:01,565 --> 00:46:05,297
From the description,
it sounds like you were justified.

601
00:46:05,703 --> 00:46:06,692
Excuse me?

602
00:46:06,905 --> 00:46:10,033
Oysters are filled
with dangerous bacteria.

603
00:46:10,241 --> 00:46:13,040
l've been trying to tell everybody!

604
00:46:13,245 --> 00:46:18,377
- I never thought you'd be on my side.
- I never thought you'd be right.

605
00:46:21,689 --> 00:46:25,216
Sir, we have a strict
no-shoes-no-service policy.

606
00:46:25,426 --> 00:46:26,860
You have to leave.

607
00:46:27,062 --> 00:46:30,225
ls that how you treat
the handicapped?

608
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:32,792
Handicap?

609
00:46:33,036 --> 00:46:36,699
l have a chronic
ingrown-toe condition.

610
00:46:36,907 --> 00:46:40,536
Doctors say that soon
l won't be able to wear...

611
00:46:40,744 --> 00:46:44,704
- ...even the roomiest of footwear.
- l'll bring your menus.

612
00:46:44,916 --> 00:46:48,318
Bring some clam strips
and some steamers...

613
00:46:48,521 --> 00:46:50,489
...when you come, please?

614
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:52,818
What's the big surprise?

615
00:46:53,527 --> 00:46:58,295
l know you wanted to go
on a trip this weekend, so....

616
00:47:02,804 --> 00:47:03,794
Buffalo?

617
00:47:04,006 --> 00:47:06,497
Buffalo, New York.

618
00:47:06,809 --> 00:47:09,745
The buffalo wing festival
this weekend.

619
00:47:11,614 --> 00:47:14,140
Great. So, what's the big surprise?

620
00:47:14,485 --> 00:47:17,613
We got tickets!
l called a scalper!

621
00:47:17,855 --> 00:47:18,981
Look.

622
00:47:19,558 --> 00:47:21,856
Ninety-nine kinds of wings.

623
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:26,259
One hundred and twenty-eight
different dipping sauces.

624
00:47:26,466 --> 00:47:29,299
You love math.
Crunch the numbers on that.

625
00:47:29,502 --> 00:47:32,097
The possibilities are infinite.

626
00:47:32,306 --> 00:47:34,570
Look! Here you are.

627
00:47:34,775 --> 00:47:36,971
Ms. Chicken Wing Festival.

628
00:47:39,814 --> 00:47:41,146
See this?

629
00:47:42,084 --> 00:47:45,417
He's the champion.
But he won't be for long.

630
00:47:45,622 --> 00:47:50,355
Because l'm coming.
l'm coming to get you, baby. Fun?

631
00:47:51,696 --> 00:47:54,631
Yeah, that's really cool, Dad.

632
00:47:54,832 --> 00:47:57,267
See, l told you she'd be excited.

633
00:47:57,469 --> 00:47:59,164
Now, tidy up, will you?

634
00:48:07,181 --> 00:48:12,518
Okay, Frank. This is your conscience
speaking. Now listen carefully.

635
00:48:12,988 --> 00:48:16,651
This hiking trip means
a lot to her. Make it work.

636
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,360
Use that charm.

637
00:48:21,264 --> 00:48:23,165
What's wrong now?

638
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:27,468
Oh, jeez.
Oh, it's this damn toe.

639
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:29,333
Do me a favor, huh?

640
00:48:30,075 --> 00:48:32,270
Don't you get old.

641
00:48:32,744 --> 00:48:35,509
Listen to the toe.
Don't you get old.

642
00:48:45,827 --> 00:48:47,692
Boss, your plan worked.

643
00:48:47,929 --> 00:48:51,764
That's right. l got this city
exactly where l want it.

644
00:48:53,435 --> 00:48:58,100
- What about the cop and the pill?
- lf they give us a problem:

645
00:48:58,341 --> 00:49:00,367
Fire!

646
00:49:10,123 --> 00:49:14,150
Get it down! Money on the wood
make the game go good.

647
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:17,023
Five bucks says size don't matter.

648
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:21,302
Let's do this thing now.

649
00:49:24,205 --> 00:49:25,969
- Chicken-pock fights.
- Get back!

650
00:49:26,475 --> 00:49:28,067
Yeah, get him!

651
00:49:28,277 --> 00:49:30,939
That's my baby! Try the headlock!

652
00:49:31,148 --> 00:49:34,584
- See that dude?
- A virus! We should arrest him!

653
00:49:34,784 --> 00:49:38,186
No, that used to be a virus,
now he's on our side.

654
00:49:38,389 --> 00:49:41,985
- That's Chill. He's a flu shot.
- He doesn't look fluish.

655
00:49:42,194 --> 00:49:45,960
Just stay here and watch
the maestro work.

656
00:49:46,798 --> 00:49:48,266
Yo, Chill! Chill!

657
00:49:48,468 --> 00:49:51,096
Pock fights are against the law.

658
00:49:52,306 --> 00:49:53,773
Where you all going?

659
00:49:53,974 --> 00:49:57,536
Thanks a lot, junior.
You just cost me twenty.

660
00:49:57,746 --> 00:50:02,183
Money won't be your problem if
you don't tell me about the sinuses.

661
00:50:02,384 --> 00:50:06,219
l was injected into this body
to rat on influenza only.

662
00:50:06,422 --> 00:50:10,553
And this don't sound
like influenza to me. Now beat it.

663
00:50:10,761 --> 00:50:14,892
l bet Johnny Streptococcus and the
Melanoma family will be interested...

664
00:50:15,099 --> 00:50:17,192
...to hear about your work.

665
00:50:17,402 --> 00:50:22,466
You can't jack me on that, brother!
l'm in the virus protection program.

666
00:50:22,675 --> 00:50:27,010
You, virus. Children's strength
ought to take care of you.

667
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:30,939
You done done it now, Chill.
He's a psycho cop.

668
00:50:31,152 --> 00:50:33,245
lt's too late to spill it.

669
00:50:33,454 --> 00:50:37,152
Just off the Thorazine.
He's cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

670
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:41,091
He's going El Pollo Loco
on your crazy behind.

671
00:50:41,798 --> 00:50:43,891
l just can't look.

672
00:50:44,234 --> 00:50:45,224
All right!

673
00:50:48,672 --> 00:50:52,302
The guy's big time.
He goes by the name of Thrax.

674
00:50:52,544 --> 00:50:55,479
Go to that new place.
The Zit, on the head.

675
00:50:55,681 --> 00:50:59,344
You can't miss it. lt's huge.
They're meeting tonight.

676
00:50:59,552 --> 00:51:00,541
l'm out.

677
00:51:01,788 --> 00:51:06,226
But you didn't hear that from me.
You didn't hear that from me.

678
00:51:07,528 --> 00:51:09,928
Next time, l'll be the bad cop.

679
00:51:10,131 --> 00:51:11,793
You are a bad cop.

680
00:51:12,701 --> 00:51:14,669
Who you calling a bad cop?

681
00:51:29,788 --> 00:51:33,316
My, what big zits he has.
How does this happen?

682
00:51:33,526 --> 00:51:36,086
You wash your face
with fried chicken.

683
00:51:40,834 --> 00:51:43,895
Wait. Where do you think you're going?

684
00:51:44,105 --> 00:51:46,335
- To get our cootie.
- Like that?

685
00:51:46,541 --> 00:51:50,069
- They'll tear you up. Get spiffy.
- Spiffy?

686
00:52:02,694 --> 00:52:04,993
Peep this. Check it out.

687
00:52:05,197 --> 00:52:09,692
Pliable cellular dynamics.
What an ingenious defense mechanism.

688
00:52:10,003 --> 00:52:11,834
Ooh, let me try.

689
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,404
What do you think?

690
00:52:18,179 --> 00:52:19,908
You should guard the car.

691
00:52:20,716 --> 00:52:24,152
This is my mission too.
l am going in with you.

692
00:52:24,353 --> 00:52:27,881
All right. But we gotta
get you something to wear.

693
00:52:34,031 --> 00:52:35,931
You sure this is working?

694
00:52:36,134 --> 00:52:38,500
Trust me, it's perfect.

695
00:52:38,703 --> 00:52:39,692
Perfect.

696
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:57,454
We got company. Be cool.

697
00:52:59,294 --> 00:53:03,891
Now, try to relax. Fit in.
Shake a tail cell or something.

698
00:53:04,968 --> 00:53:07,368
l don't dance.
l have no left feet.

699
00:53:07,604 --> 00:53:08,936
You don't dance?

700
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:12,769
Don't tell me you ain't
never gotten jiggy with it.

701
00:53:12,978 --> 00:53:15,037
l don't believe l have.

702
00:53:15,247 --> 00:53:18,308
Come on, baby, give me
a little bit of this.

703
00:53:18,885 --> 00:53:19,874
Oh, all right.

704
00:53:20,453 --> 00:53:22,819
- Here you go.
- That's it, baby.

705
00:53:23,022 --> 00:53:26,117
- Get down.
- Don't let it settle at the bottom.

706
00:53:27,694 --> 00:53:29,253
Oh, mama. Yo!

707
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:37,864
You stay and practice.
Boy, you need it.

708
00:53:38,107 --> 00:53:41,475
lf l'm not back in five,
you come looking, okay?

709
00:54:19,857 --> 00:54:21,883
Barkeep, what you got?

710
00:54:29,268 --> 00:54:34,502
- You got a problem with that?
- No. lt's just the way l like it:

711
00:54:34,708 --> 00:54:37,438
Extra disgusting.

712
00:55:01,373 --> 00:55:04,901
Three teams will move through
the cranial artery...

713
00:55:05,111 --> 00:55:07,773
...and one through
the nasal passages.

714
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:12,441
We are going to the brain, baby.
And we are stealing one of these.

715
00:55:12,653 --> 00:55:16,852
This sucker comes from a place
called the hypothalamus gland.

716
00:55:18,459 --> 00:55:21,918
Hypothalamus. Hypothalamus.

717
00:55:22,131 --> 00:55:24,793
Controls the temperature for the body.

718
00:55:25,001 --> 00:55:28,596
We are going to march in
and take the prize.

719
00:55:28,939 --> 00:55:32,637
Frank's gonna heat up
like a sidewalk on a summer day.

720
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:42,213
Go away.

721
00:55:46,025 --> 00:55:47,960
l need to talk to you.

722
00:55:54,569 --> 00:55:55,627
What a zit!

723
00:55:56,171 --> 00:55:58,140
What is it? What do you want?

724
00:55:59,075 --> 00:56:01,236
l want you to help me.

725
00:56:01,711 --> 00:56:03,577
Should l call the cops?

726
00:56:03,947 --> 00:56:08,544
Or maybe Shane should know
about the 200-yard restraining order.

727
00:56:08,753 --> 00:56:12,554
Please. She's been
humiliated enough already.

728
00:56:13,892 --> 00:56:14,881
Humiliated.

729
00:56:15,094 --> 00:56:18,724
You turned me into
a walking air-sickness bag.

730
00:56:18,932 --> 00:56:21,867
My family was humiliated.
You understand?

731
00:56:22,068 --> 00:56:24,560
Do you have any idea
of the teasing...

732
00:56:24,772 --> 00:56:28,003
...that my sons, Ralph and Chuck,
had to endure?

733
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:32,302
l know your daughter Hurly
had to transfer.

734
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,073
Her name is Shirley.

735
00:56:34,784 --> 00:56:36,809
That is much prettier.

736
00:56:37,587 --> 00:56:40,785
- Tom Brokaw called her Hurly.
- What?

737
00:56:40,991 --> 00:56:43,016
But it was a cute picture.

738
00:56:44,229 --> 00:56:48,495
We gotta get this water underneath
our bridge, for Shane's sake.

739
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:52,728
l would never hold anything
against one of my students.

740
00:56:53,205 --> 00:56:55,071
Get back to work!

741
00:56:56,877 --> 00:57:00,780
- Be prepared. lt's going down tonight.
- Tonight?

742
00:57:00,982 --> 00:57:04,281
Me and Madcow
are going to Wrestlemania.

743
00:57:04,986 --> 00:57:05,976
See this?

744
00:57:06,588 --> 00:57:10,524
This DNA bead comes from a girl
in Riverside, California.

745
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:14,993
Didn't like to wash her hands.
Took me three whole weeks.

746
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:18,794
And this one.
Nice lady in Detroit, Motown.

747
00:57:19,003 --> 00:57:20,493
Six days flat.

748
00:57:20,805 --> 00:57:23,297
Then there's this old guy in Philly.

749
00:57:23,675 --> 00:57:26,804
l killed him in seventy-two hours.

750
00:57:27,013 --> 00:57:31,815
l'm getting better as l go, but
the problem is l never set a record.

751
00:57:32,052 --> 00:57:34,179
Until my man Frank, that is.

752
00:57:34,421 --> 00:57:39,121
l'll take him down in 48 hours.
Get my chapter in the medical books.

753
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:45,426
Excuse me. Excuse me.
l got one more question here.

754
00:57:45,634 --> 00:57:50,595
Could a white blood cell
do anything to stop this evil plan?

755
00:57:50,807 --> 00:57:54,141
You know, hypothetically speaking,
that is.

756
00:57:54,712 --> 00:57:58,945
- And, who are you?
- Who am l? Who am l?

757
00:57:59,785 --> 00:58:04,587
A bad, booty-shaking pickinosis.
Yeah. That's who l am.

758
00:58:04,791 --> 00:58:07,521
- Never heard of you.
- You just got here.

759
00:58:07,727 --> 00:58:11,164
But ask any of them,
when it comes to illing...

760
00:58:11,365 --> 00:58:15,097
...bad, booty-shaking pickinosis
stands above the rest.

761
00:58:15,303 --> 00:58:17,430
Oh, that hurts.

762
00:58:18,673 --> 00:58:19,971
That ain't no germ.

763
00:58:20,176 --> 00:58:21,905
That's a cop.

764
00:58:23,112 --> 00:58:28,346
Well, what do we have here?
An officer of Frank's finest.

765
00:58:28,552 --> 00:58:32,455
Somebody lay down a towel.
This is going to be messy.

766
00:58:34,392 --> 00:58:37,362
Attention, germs. You are surrounded.

767
00:58:39,398 --> 00:58:40,387
Surrounded.

768
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,125
Yo, Hammer. You can stop dancing.

769
00:58:49,477 --> 00:58:50,466
What kept you?

770
00:58:52,548 --> 00:58:54,015
Es el muerte rojo!

771
00:58:54,216 --> 00:58:56,515
No me mates!
Get out of here!

772
00:58:56,719 --> 00:58:59,153
Please lift the restraining order...

773
00:58:59,355 --> 00:59:02,018
...so l can do this
father-daughter trip.

774
00:59:02,226 --> 00:59:04,217
The answer is no.

775
00:59:04,829 --> 00:59:06,353
Please.

776
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,395
Think about it overnight.

777
00:59:12,839 --> 00:59:17,105
lt would make a little girl
very happy.

778
00:59:20,214 --> 00:59:23,878
Only for use against
the most stubborn cold symptoms.

779
00:59:26,454 --> 00:59:28,616
- Childproof caps.
- Get him!

780
00:59:36,933 --> 00:59:38,663
Why you hit so hard?

781
00:59:44,176 --> 00:59:47,168
Drix, l could use a little help here.

782
00:59:47,379 --> 00:59:48,368
Give me that.

783
00:59:55,689 --> 00:59:58,590
Oh, no. Not again.

784
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:10,337
You have something white on your lips.

785
01:00:11,842 --> 01:00:13,503
Other side.

786
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:20,744
Get out!

787
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,212
Out!

788
01:00:22,421 --> 01:00:26,756
The answer is no! Absolutely not!

789
01:00:34,101 --> 01:00:37,196
Thanks. You saved my cytoplasm
in there.

790
01:00:41,076 --> 01:00:43,477
Mr. Thrax has left the building.

791
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:52,884
Let's call for a scab
and get to the precinct.

792
01:00:57,095 --> 01:00:59,564
Jones! In my offiice.

793
01:01:00,132 --> 01:01:04,194
Hey, hey, who died?
Other than Thrax, that is. Brandy!

794
01:01:04,404 --> 01:01:08,238
- l mean, Leah. Why are you here?
- You really did it now.

795
01:01:08,443 --> 01:01:13,176
- l didn't see you back there.
- Disregarding orders, destruction...

796
01:01:13,381 --> 01:01:17,682
...popping a pimple without a permit!
What were you doing there?

797
01:01:17,886 --> 01:01:21,618
- Promoting good health, sir.
- ls that what you call it?

798
01:01:21,825 --> 01:01:24,590
He was lethal.
lf we hadn't stopped him--

799
01:01:24,795 --> 01:01:29,289
- We'd be frying eggs off of Frank!
- Watch it, you'll cause a panic.

800
01:01:29,501 --> 01:01:33,267
People would think
about what's going on in this body...

801
01:01:33,472 --> 01:01:34,872
...not the stupid trip!

802
01:01:35,074 --> 01:01:39,443
Okay, you want us to start thinking?
Well, here's a thought:

803
01:01:39,645 --> 01:01:41,079
You're fired.

804
01:01:41,648 --> 01:01:43,809
- Mr. Mayor--
- Your badge, mister.

805
01:01:44,318 --> 01:01:48,756
Figures. l finally do something right
for Frank, and l get fired.

806
01:01:52,828 --> 01:01:56,265
Without him, Frank could've been
in mortal danger.

807
01:01:56,466 --> 01:02:01,096
Mortal danger? You'd love to prove
that, wouldn't you, Mr. Drixenol?

808
01:02:01,305 --> 01:02:04,638
Get your name in the
New England Journal ofMedicine.

809
01:02:04,842 --> 01:02:08,108
Son, read what it says on your arm.

810
01:02:08,313 --> 01:02:11,043
''For the temporary relief
of symptoms--''

811
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:14,448
Exactly. Temporary.

812
01:02:14,654 --> 01:02:16,645
You're a wannabe. A placebo.

813
01:02:16,856 --> 01:02:20,850
A generic brand.
An over-the-counter Tic-Tac.

814
01:02:21,495 --> 01:02:24,329
Now, get out of my body!

815
01:02:28,604 --> 01:02:31,198
Continuing symptoms,
while annoying...

816
01:02:31,407 --> 01:02:35,208
... will not derailplans
for the trip to the annual...

817
01:02:35,412 --> 01:02:37,539
...chicken wing festival.

818
01:02:39,951 --> 01:02:42,419
- What's so funny?
- l don't know.

819
01:02:43,756 --> 01:02:46,782
They're making this too easy.

820
01:02:48,427 --> 01:02:52,125
You know, no one has ever
gotten wise to me...

821
01:02:52,332 --> 01:02:54,301
...and now for the first time...

822
01:02:54,502 --> 01:02:57,869
...an immunity cell
has figured out everything...

823
01:02:58,072 --> 01:03:00,064
...and they don't believe him.

824
01:03:02,744 --> 01:03:05,646
Can you taste the irony in that?

825
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:10,046
Shut up! What are you two laughing at?

826
01:03:11,989 --> 01:03:13,616
We're back on schedule.

827
01:03:14,091 --> 01:03:16,890
But boss, we're the only ones left.

828
01:03:17,095 --> 01:03:20,258
Maybe we should incubate for a while?

829
01:03:21,534 --> 01:03:23,092
You incubate.

830
01:03:23,302 --> 01:03:26,067
l'm going to make my deadline.

831
01:03:28,008 --> 01:03:31,274
Medical books aren't written
about losers.

832
01:03:37,052 --> 01:03:38,485
l'm not going.

833
01:03:39,688 --> 01:03:44,388
- You're not going where, hon?
- To Buffalo. l'm not going.

834
01:03:46,563 --> 01:03:50,728
Honey, we're all packed.
Buffalo's going to be a blast.

835
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:54,665
l'm going camping with my friends.

836
01:03:54,873 --> 01:03:56,704
You're welcome to join us.

837
01:03:57,009 --> 01:03:59,501
Well, l don't think....

838
01:03:59,712 --> 01:04:01,771
l'd really like you to come.

839
01:04:03,517 --> 01:04:06,918
You don't want me
huffing and puffing after you.

840
01:04:07,121 --> 01:04:08,749
You want to go, okay.

841
01:04:08,957 --> 01:04:11,482
Uncle Bob will go with me to Buffalo.

842
01:04:13,996 --> 01:04:16,658
l'm tired of this. lt's not fair.

843
01:04:16,866 --> 01:04:19,597
l go where you want.
l eat what you want.

844
01:04:19,803 --> 01:04:22,601
Don't you ever think
about anyone else?

845
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,238
l think about you.

846
01:04:25,643 --> 01:04:29,580
Like when you packed me
a fried Slim Jim sandwich?

847
01:04:30,716 --> 01:04:33,412
Yeah. lt was a turkey Slim Jim.

848
01:04:33,686 --> 01:04:35,086
You know, Dad....

849
01:04:36,823 --> 01:04:40,590
Maybe if you and Mom
listened to me a little more...

850
01:04:40,795 --> 01:04:43,025
...and took care of yourselves...

851
01:04:43,231 --> 01:04:45,223
...maybe she'd still be here.

852
01:04:46,902 --> 01:04:51,306
lKnock off that hamburger talk.
Come here, honey.

853
01:04:54,611 --> 01:04:56,443
Your mom died...

854
01:04:57,348 --> 01:04:59,213
...because she got sick.

855
01:05:00,384 --> 01:05:02,910
And how do you think you get sick?

856
01:05:03,121 --> 01:05:04,645
Germs.

857
01:05:04,990 --> 01:05:06,959
lt's the way you eat.

858
01:05:45,171 --> 01:05:46,160
Who's that?

859
01:05:46,372 --> 01:05:50,207
You know my great-great-grandpappy
fought the measles?

860
01:05:50,411 --> 01:05:55,611
There's been a Jones on the force
since we came on the umbilical cord.

861
01:05:55,850 --> 01:05:57,943
Until now, that is.

862
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:01,183
All right, ladies.
Wrap it up now.

863
01:06:04,561 --> 01:06:08,088
Well, l....
l guess l should get going.

864
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:11,325
Wouldn't want Frank
to build immunity to me.

865
01:06:11,536 --> 01:06:15,166
Maybe next time he takes Drixenol
it'll do him some good.

866
01:06:17,176 --> 01:06:19,770
- Goodbye, Drips.
- That's Drix.

867
01:06:20,447 --> 01:06:21,539
Whatever.

868
01:07:17,847 --> 01:07:19,713
People, let's get started.

869
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:24,818
l don't need to remind anyone
that today's our trip to Buffalo.

870
01:07:25,023 --> 01:07:30,326
Frank will be up in 20 minutes.
l don't want him losing an eyelash...

871
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:32,122
...or stubbing his toe.

872
01:07:37,304 --> 01:07:38,396
Free screening?

873
01:07:38,605 --> 01:07:43,009
We're broadcasting live dreams
from the brain's subconscious.

874
01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:55,691
You get back to work right now.

875
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:10,603
That's right, big boy.
You keep on dreaming.

876
01:08:11,312 --> 01:08:13,337
At least you got your health.

877
01:08:14,949 --> 01:08:17,145
Ninety-eight point six.

878
01:08:17,352 --> 01:08:20,412
Ninety-eight point six.

879
01:08:21,223 --> 01:08:24,660
- Ninety-eight point six.
- Perfect.

880
01:08:28,398 --> 01:08:30,423
You can't come in here!

881
01:08:38,544 --> 01:08:39,568
Baby...

882
01:08:39,778 --> 01:08:43,237
...you are looking fine today.

883
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:09,638
Don't forget the cushion
we take to football games.

884
01:09:09,848 --> 01:09:13,477
Don't want the voters
in the hemorrhoids complaining.

885
01:09:13,718 --> 01:09:16,210
Something's wrong with the weather.

886
01:09:16,422 --> 01:09:19,790
- We're probably drinking coffee.
- Look at the map.

887
01:09:19,993 --> 01:09:22,518
- What if Jones is right?
- Jones?

888
01:09:23,797 --> 01:09:25,265
Funny. Funny.

889
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,400
You care more about your reelection...

890
01:09:28,603 --> 01:09:30,572
...than our lives.

891
01:09:30,773 --> 01:09:33,970
l'm going to the hypothalamus
to check it out.

892
01:09:34,176 --> 01:09:35,667
Hypo-who-what is this?

893
01:09:35,879 --> 01:09:38,609
Leah, wait!
Who will answer the phones?

894
01:09:50,062 --> 01:09:52,327
Be advised. We have a break-in.

895
01:09:58,539 --> 01:09:59,870
Sarge?

896
01:10:01,208 --> 01:10:03,609
Nothing down there but bad dreams.

897
01:10:05,013 --> 01:10:06,708
Frankie.

898
01:10:10,786 --> 01:10:11,775
Wait.

899
01:10:13,056 --> 01:10:18,154
Maybe Shane would like to know
about the 200-yard restraining order.

900
01:10:19,464 --> 01:10:23,128
Maybe if you and Mom
listened to me a little more...

901
01:10:23,335 --> 01:10:25,803
...and took care of yourselves...

902
01:10:26,005 --> 01:10:30,204
- ...maybe she'd still be here.
- You're fiired. Get out ofhere!

903
01:10:30,844 --> 01:10:33,939
- Get out!
- No, l can't.

904
01:10:35,483 --> 01:10:37,849
- Get back to work.
- What the-- Huh?

905
01:10:40,188 --> 01:10:42,315
What the heck was that?

906
01:10:43,592 --> 01:10:46,960
Francis Detorre,
you stand up right now!

907
01:10:49,633 --> 01:10:52,727
Thrax is alive and he's in the brain!

908
01:10:52,936 --> 01:10:55,599
Oh, great, pal. Spoil the ending.

909
01:10:55,807 --> 01:10:58,367
- What's your temperature?
- 98.6.

910
01:10:58,576 --> 01:11:00,977
- ls this broken again?
- Drix!

911
01:11:02,014 --> 01:11:06,975
You get those skid marks
out ofmy class! Out the door!

912
01:11:31,549 --> 01:11:34,610
This cat was sick before l
even got here.

913
01:11:36,488 --> 01:11:40,448
Now boarding: the 937,
with nonstop service...

914
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:43,494
- ...to the toilet bowl.
- Tickets, please.

915
01:11:48,536 --> 01:11:49,901
lKeep it moving.

916
01:11:50,105 --> 01:11:51,572
- Thank you.
- Drix!

917
01:11:51,773 --> 01:11:53,332
- Yo, Drix!
- Jones?

918
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:55,510
Get your butt off this boat!

919
01:11:55,711 --> 01:12:00,376
- Thrax is alive. Let's go.
- l'm sorry, Osmosis. l can't help you.

920
01:12:00,584 --> 01:12:01,642
Excuse me?

921
01:12:01,852 --> 01:12:04,720
l can't combat a virus.
Read my label.

922
01:12:04,922 --> 01:12:07,390
Learn to think outside the pillbox.

923
01:12:07,592 --> 01:12:08,753
lKeep it moving.

924
01:12:09,161 --> 01:12:13,291
l know sugar pills who cured cancer,
because they believed.

925
01:12:13,766 --> 01:12:16,827
Oh, l don't know, Ozzy. Look at me.

926
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:19,332
l'm cherry-flavored.

927
01:12:21,509 --> 01:12:24,239
Hey, pal, are you on or off?

928
01:12:24,679 --> 01:12:27,409
Fine. Flush your life
down the toilet.

929
01:12:27,616 --> 01:12:32,179
The zipper's down.
All ashore that's going ashore.

930
01:12:43,301 --> 01:12:47,170
- You know a pill who cured cancer?
- No.

931
01:12:47,373 --> 01:12:49,364
lt makes for a good pep talk.

932
01:12:50,776 --> 01:12:53,507
Let's go catch a cold.

933
01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:59,851
How about a hug for your Uncle Bob?

934
01:13:00,054 --> 01:13:03,388
Okay. Nice talking to you too.

935
01:13:04,326 --> 01:13:06,351
Hey, muscles.

936
01:13:06,963 --> 01:13:10,228
- You don't look so good.
- l feel a little fluey.

937
01:13:10,433 --> 01:13:14,530
You know what they say,
''Starve a cold, drown the flu.''

938
01:13:14,738 --> 01:13:18,038
Your body needs fluids.
And lots of them.

939
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:19,841
ls beer fluid?

940
01:13:20,045 --> 01:13:21,239
Of course.

941
01:13:21,446 --> 01:13:25,941
- What about all that wet stuff in it?
- l thought that was the beer.

942
01:13:26,185 --> 01:13:30,316
No, finish that up.
Come on, we want to get better.

943
01:13:30,524 --> 01:13:35,428
There we go. That's it.
That's my good washboard-tummy guy.

944
01:13:37,298 --> 01:13:40,063
This is it. Men, go, go, go.

945
01:13:41,670 --> 01:13:43,194
Hi, baby.

946
01:13:44,307 --> 01:13:46,332
Why are you waiting?
Shoot him!

947
01:13:46,543 --> 01:13:48,807
lf you follow me, she dies.

948
01:13:49,013 --> 01:13:50,002
Don't shoot.

949
01:13:57,322 --> 01:14:01,657
- This ain't time to get carsick.
- l'm okay, l'm 1/8 Dramamine!

950
01:14:01,861 --> 01:14:04,227
lt's just this darn heat!

951
01:14:05,099 --> 01:14:08,967
As long as it don't hit 108 degrees,
or Shane's an orphan.

952
01:14:13,942 --> 01:14:18,403
Shane, look what l bought for you.
They're false eyelashes.

953
01:14:18,614 --> 01:14:19,979
Whatever.

954
01:14:24,788 --> 01:14:26,484
Just close your eye.

955
01:14:28,359 --> 01:14:30,884
You look good with falsies.

956
01:14:36,135 --> 01:14:36,966
What the--?

957
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:38,569
Let me go!

958
01:14:48,784 --> 01:14:51,514
Oh, don't worry.
Shane will be fiine.

959
01:14:52,087 --> 01:14:55,922
l want to her to be at ease
and not worry.

960
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:57,183
Listen...

961
01:14:57,661 --> 01:15:00,824
...why don't you sit her down
and tell her...

962
01:15:01,031 --> 01:15:05,366
...that if anything happens to you,
l will take care of her. Okay?

963
01:15:05,904 --> 01:15:08,897
l will nurture her,
l will love her...

964
01:15:09,108 --> 01:15:12,043
...and when she's 1 6,
l'll boot her out.

965
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,706
Sixteen?

966
01:15:13,914 --> 01:15:18,613
l'm not gonna mommy her forever, okay?
l mean, sixteen, sure.

967
01:15:20,021 --> 01:15:22,046
Frank? Are you all right?

968
01:15:25,961 --> 01:15:29,398
We've a hostage situation
involving the mayor's aide.

969
01:15:29,599 --> 01:15:32,124
Leah, girl, what were you thinking?

970
01:15:32,335 --> 01:15:33,563
Now, we go live...

971
01:15:33,770 --> 01:15:37,298
...to a chase in the superior
vena cava expressway.

972
01:15:37,508 --> 01:15:40,205
Reports ofa hostage are confiirmed.

973
01:15:47,253 --> 01:15:48,379
Look out!

974
01:15:53,027 --> 01:15:56,156
Suspect is headed towards the uvula.

975
01:15:56,398 --> 01:15:58,161
What the heck is a ''uvala''?

976
01:15:58,366 --> 01:16:02,531
- lt's that dangly thing in Frank's--
- Boxer shorts! Okay!

977
01:16:02,738 --> 01:16:04,035
Not that thing!

978
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:05,764
The one in his throat!

979
01:16:06,510 --> 01:16:09,035
l knew that. l knew that.

980
01:16:13,251 --> 01:16:14,809
Are you with me?

981
01:16:15,053 --> 01:16:18,217
Frank, are you with me?
Are you okay?

982
01:16:18,457 --> 01:16:20,891
l feel fine. Say it!

983
01:16:22,695 --> 01:16:24,526
Frank. Hold on, here.

984
01:16:24,764 --> 01:16:28,599
You're going to the hospital.
The trip is off.

985
01:16:28,803 --> 01:16:32,398
- Pull it over, big guy.
- The trip is off? No!

986
01:16:36,445 --> 01:16:38,471
Shane, isn't that your dad?

987
01:16:41,818 --> 01:16:43,377
Oh, my God.

988
01:16:44,021 --> 01:16:45,886
Stop the bus!

989
01:16:46,457 --> 01:16:48,653
Dad! Uncle Bob!

990
01:16:51,996 --> 01:16:53,463
Shane, you're here?

991
01:16:53,665 --> 01:16:55,634
- l'm her niece!
- What happened?

992
01:16:55,835 --> 01:16:58,065
Your daddy's had an accident.

993
01:16:58,270 --> 01:17:00,762
- ls he okay?
- He's going to be fine.

994
01:17:00,974 --> 01:17:04,034
l hope he's going to be okay.
Come on.

995
01:17:15,091 --> 01:17:17,685
Let me go! Watch the hands, buddy!

996
01:17:17,894 --> 01:17:19,657
- Hold up.
- Put me down!

997
01:17:19,863 --> 01:17:22,765
- Critical one here!
- Coming through.

998
01:17:25,904 --> 01:17:30,808
- What's the story on this one?
- l don't know. He's burning up.

999
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:34,446
Let's move on my mark.
One, two, lift!

1000
01:17:40,621 --> 01:17:45,650
- What is that nasty smell?
- Cherry. Wild cherry.

1001
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:47,123
Now let her go.

1002
01:17:48,531 --> 01:17:51,557
Why? So you can ice me again?

1003
01:17:51,767 --> 01:17:53,258
No! So l can!

1004
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,774
Virus con Dios.

1005
01:18:09,122 --> 01:18:11,022
Jones! Ooh, thank Frank.

1006
01:18:11,224 --> 01:18:12,350
Temperature?

1007
01:18:12,559 --> 01:18:14,892
- lt's at 106.2.
- Put him in ice!

1008
01:18:15,095 --> 01:18:16,926
We gotta cool him down!

1009
01:18:19,034 --> 01:18:22,367
- We need some ice in here!
- Right, l'll get it.

1010
01:18:23,773 --> 01:18:24,762
Daddy?

1011
01:18:25,074 --> 01:18:26,268
Maggie.

1012
01:18:26,475 --> 01:18:28,739
No, Dad. lt's me, Shane.

1013
01:18:29,546 --> 01:18:32,174
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

1014
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:35,549
l ain't got time for this.

1015
01:18:40,926 --> 01:18:44,259
This is Frank PD.
We have you surrounded.

1016
01:18:44,463 --> 01:18:45,556
Surrender.

1017
01:18:45,765 --> 01:18:49,326
- Give it up. You're busted.
- Hand over the bracelet.

1018
01:18:49,536 --> 01:18:51,596
You're making this too easy.

1019
01:18:51,973 --> 01:18:53,998
- Pollen?
- Check this out.

1020
01:18:54,208 --> 01:18:55,836
Oh, no!

1021
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:57,739
Mother of Frank!

1022
01:19:01,618 --> 01:19:04,086
Enjoy the funeral, boys!

1023
01:19:10,127 --> 01:19:12,619
- We're dead.
- How's your aim?

1024
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:14,458
A lot better than yours!

1025
01:19:14,666 --> 01:19:16,532
What are you doing?

1026
01:19:17,937 --> 01:19:18,995
Saving Frank.

1027
01:19:19,405 --> 01:19:20,599
Let's do it.

1028
01:19:21,975 --> 01:19:23,499
You want Osmosis?

1029
01:19:23,710 --> 01:19:25,371
You've got Osmosis.

1030
01:19:53,178 --> 01:19:57,309
You just don't know when to quit,
do you, Jones?

1031
01:20:14,571 --> 01:20:18,132
You know what, Jones?
You want this chain so bad...

1032
01:20:18,842 --> 01:20:22,836
...Big Daddy Thrax
is gonna let you have it.

1033
01:20:23,381 --> 01:20:25,247
Looks good on you, Jones.

1034
01:20:25,451 --> 01:20:26,941
You wear it well.

1035
01:20:27,386 --> 01:20:30,584
lt's a shame you came
this far just to die.

1036
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:47,839
Who's the Germinator now?

1037
01:20:56,988 --> 01:20:58,785
lt's a falsie.

1038
01:21:03,262 --> 01:21:06,663
Can you feel the heat, Jones?

1039
01:21:07,768 --> 01:21:11,465
Too bad you won't be here
to see me break my record...

1040
01:21:11,671 --> 01:21:15,810
...when l take down
Frank's pretty little girl.

1041
01:21:16,010 --> 01:21:17,773
She ain't going down.

1042
01:21:20,382 --> 01:21:22,976
- You are.
- What?

1043
01:21:33,899 --> 01:21:35,230
No!

1044
01:22:10,107 --> 01:22:12,235
We're losing him. Breathe!

1045
01:22:13,412 --> 01:22:17,509
- Come on, man.
- Daddy! No! l don't want to lose you!

1046
01:22:18,051 --> 01:22:20,042
- Take her out.
- Come on, honey.

1047
01:22:20,386 --> 01:22:24,517
- No, that's my dad!
- The doctor's doing everything he can.

1048
01:22:24,758 --> 01:22:25,747
Hey! Wait!

1049
01:22:26,661 --> 01:22:27,992
Frank!

1050
01:22:28,263 --> 01:22:29,491
Frank!

1051
01:22:36,072 --> 01:22:39,804
Things are grim as temperatures
rise dangerously.

1052
01:22:40,010 --> 01:22:42,878
We've lost contact
with the extremities.

1053
01:22:43,081 --> 01:22:46,573
NNN will stay on the air
as long as possible.

1054
01:22:46,784 --> 01:22:51,813
When we return, household appliances
that can improve your golfswing.

1055
01:22:52,024 --> 01:22:56,394
You silly twit, don't you get it?!
We are going to die!

1056
01:22:56,596 --> 01:23:00,328
I knew it. At the fiirst dark cloud,
you fall apart.

1057
01:23:00,535 --> 01:23:01,593
- Moron!
- Phony!

1058
01:23:10,446 --> 01:23:15,714
Gentlemen, playing with you has been
the greatest pleasure of my life.

1059
01:23:36,778 --> 01:23:39,872
He's not coming back.
He's not gonna make it.

1060
01:23:45,754 --> 01:23:47,746
Come on, sweetheart.
He'll be....

1061
01:23:54,465 --> 01:23:55,454
That's it.

1062
01:23:55,666 --> 01:23:57,157
- Wait, hey.
- Daddy!

1063
01:23:57,369 --> 01:24:00,031
l'm so sorry.
l didn't mean to say that.

1064
01:24:00,439 --> 01:24:04,240
l don't blame you for Mom's death.
l didn't mean it.

1065
01:24:04,444 --> 01:24:06,970
You're the greatest dad in the world.

1066
01:24:38,017 --> 01:24:39,007
Look!

1067
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:57,234
Get that thing
to the hypothalamus now!

1068
01:25:02,913 --> 01:25:04,744
Okay, l'm calling it.

1069
01:25:04,948 --> 01:25:08,783
l'm sorry. sweetie.
Come on. l know.

1070
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:17,128
Wait a minute!
He's got a pulse!

1071
01:25:20,834 --> 01:25:22,666
He's coming back.

1072
01:25:23,004 --> 01:25:24,835
One-oh-seven-point-seven.

1073
01:25:25,039 --> 01:25:27,406
One-oh-seven-point-six.

1074
01:25:36,653 --> 01:25:38,679
Your mama says, ''Hi.''

1075
01:25:55,042 --> 01:25:59,980
As temperatures stabilize, a
grateful city salutes Osmosis Jones.

1076
01:26:00,181 --> 01:26:02,206
The offiicer who saved us.

1077
01:26:02,450 --> 01:26:06,888
Jones has been reinstated
to the force with fullprivileges.

1078
01:26:07,089 --> 01:26:10,389
Ozzy, can l count on you
to keep Frank in shape?

1079
01:26:10,594 --> 01:26:13,085
We got that insurance
exam next month.

1080
01:26:13,296 --> 01:26:17,563
You're going to have to talk
to my new partner.

1081
01:26:17,835 --> 01:26:21,567
- lf he feels like hanging around.
- But my visa's expired.

1082
01:26:21,774 --> 01:26:25,643
We'll go to the hemorrhoid
and get you a good lawyer.

1083
01:26:28,848 --> 01:26:34,014
Come here, baby. l'm still Jonesing
for a little more Osmosis.

1084
01:27:16,271 --> 01:27:19,799
Oh, my God. Look how beautiful.

1085
01:27:20,376 --> 01:27:22,470
l told you it'd be worth it.

1086
01:27:25,082 --> 01:27:29,144
Didn't think l'd break a sweat
coming up here. But l did.

1087
01:27:30,388 --> 01:27:33,085
Yeah, it was kind of a long drive.

1088
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:35,459
Carrot?

1089
01:27:50,512 --> 01:27:52,537
l wonder what this does.

1090
01:27:57,621 --> 01:27:59,749
- Dad.
- Was that you?

1091
01:28:01,959 --> 01:28:05,327
What the heck.
Out with the old, in with the new.
