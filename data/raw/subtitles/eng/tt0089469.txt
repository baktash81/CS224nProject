1
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,920
I am the lord of darkness.

2
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,640
I require the solace
of the shadows...

3
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,680
and the dark of the night.

4
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,080
Sunshine is my destroyer.

5
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,720
All this shall change.

6
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,360
Tonight, the sun sets forever.

7
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,600
There shall never be
another dawn...

8
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,840
Ah, Blix.

9
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,760
Come closer.

10
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,480
You summoned me, lordship?

11
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,720
Are you not the most loathsome
of my goblins?

12
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,520
Truly, master.

13
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,160
And is your heart black
and full of hate?

14
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,360
Black as midnight,
black as pitch,

15
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,680
blacker than
the foulest witch.

16
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,440
That is why
I have called you here.

17
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,120
Since I must remain in darkness,
you shall be my eyes and ears.

18
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,120
You do me
great honor, lord.

19
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,560
Something troubles me.

20
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,560
I feel a presence
in the forest,

21
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,640
a force I had mercifully
almost forgotten.

22
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,080
Must be dread, indeed,
to trouble you, lordship.

23
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,080
Looking upon
these frail creatures,

24
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,640
one would not think that
they could contain such power.

25
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,440
One could rule
the universe with it.

26
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,720
You must find them for me
and destroy them!

27
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,560
What do they look like, lord?

28
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,120
Fool! Let this
serve to remind you.

29
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,240
They are each crowned
with a single horn...

30
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,960
reaching straight
to heaven.

31
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,640
I get the point, lord.

32
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,640
Bring the horns to me.

33
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,840
You will be well rewarded.

34
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,400
You shall be a prince
here in my realm.

35
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,320
A rare privilege, master.

36
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,800
Where shall I look, sire?

37
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,760
There is only one lure
for such disgusting goodness,

38
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,080
one bait that never fails.

39
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,640
What be this bait?
Please, you teach me.

40
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,760
Innocence. Innocence.

41
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,920
Come, white flowers

42
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,800
Weave us a carpet

43
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,000
Spreading oak

44
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,240
Make a shade where we lie

45
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,480
Leaves and branches
whisper our love song

46
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,920
When I look
in my true love's eyes

47
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,920
Young as any spring

48
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,640
His eyes almost sing

49
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,360
To me

50
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,280
Blooming fairies!

51
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,320
Lily!

52
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,440
God bless, Your Highness.

53
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,240
A royal visit's
always a pleasure.

54
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,560
Have another biscuit.

55
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,520
Nell...

56
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,640
I have no time to stay
for a visit today.

57
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,720
Oh, you've got
a sweetheart waiting?

58
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,440
No, I don't.
Surely, your father
forbids such folly.

59
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,440
What my father doesn't know
won't trouble him.

60
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,600
Oh, the willful heart
invites despair,

61
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,480
like blind men creeping
in a dragon's lair.

62
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,920
Not a country proverb
nor king's command...

63
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,360
could keep me
from the woods today.

64
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:01,760
Then it's common sense sort.
Lily. Princess Lily.

65
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,480
I look on you as a daughter.
If you'll pardon my saying it,

66
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,320
it's time you started behaving
like the princess you are.

67
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,080
You should be out looking
for a handsome prince
on a white charger,

68
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,880
not visiting
poor folk like us.

69
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,080
No. Don't you know
I love coming here?

70
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,760
This place holds
more magic for me...

71
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,120
than any palace
in the world.

72
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,720
You live a very rich
life, Nell.

73
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,120
I don't know of a prince
who could carve wood like this.

74
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,880
You're very sweet, Lily.

75
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,080
Magic is a wonderful thing.

76
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,120
You'll find your own magic
one day.

77
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,440
I'm sure you will.

78
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,080
I have no time for this.
I'm going.

79
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,120
Oh, and you look out
for spriggen and banshee,
my girl.

80
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,240
These woods
be thick with them.

81
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,320
Stay clear of toadstool
rings and willow trees...

82
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,640
and old oaks.

83
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,640
Jack!

84
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,560
Where are you?

85
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,400
Jack!

86
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,640
- Jack! Jack!

87
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Jack?

88
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,600
Jack?

89
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,360
Jack, answer me.

90
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,880
Jack! Jack!

91
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,880
Jack.

92
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,800
Jack, please.
Please, if you're here,
say something to me, please.

93
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,320
Jack, you scared
the life out of me!

94
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,280
You're so clever.

95
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,360
Oh, here.

96
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,680
Whoops. Look inside.
See what you can find.

97
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,000
That's something to eat.

98
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,440
I made that for you myself.

99
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,800
Well, I-I took it from Nell.

100
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,040
Do you like it? Is it sweet?

101
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,320
I know someone sweeter.

102
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,080
May be innocent,
may be sweet...

103
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,440
ain't half as nice
as rotting meat.

104
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,000
Good. Very good.
Just right.

105
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,920
Jack, now teach me rabbit
like you promised.

106
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,920
Rabbit?

107
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,680
It's much harder
than finch.
Let me try.

108
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,960
I'm a good student,
and my father says
I'm brilliant.

109
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,640
See how brilliant I am?

110
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,520
Let me dazzle you
with my wisdom.

111
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,000
It's much more than wisdom
that dazzles me, Lily.

112
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,960
Jack, teach me rabbit.

113
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,120
Not today.

114
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,120
Why not?

115
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,440
Because...

116
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,560
there's something
really special that I've
been promising to show you.

117
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,320
- Jack, do you mean it?
- Only if it pleases you, Lily.

118
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,560
Oh, it pleases me
more than anything.

119
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,960
We must go now...

120
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,160
because they'll only be here
for a short while.

121
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,920
Don't you trust me?

122
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,520
I trust you, Lily.

123
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,760
Oh, Jack.

124
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,040
Look! Ugly
one-horned mules.

125
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,840
Nothing is more magical.

126
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,920
As long as they roam
the earth,

127
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,880
evil can never harm
the pure of heart.

128
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,160
Do you speak
their language?

129
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,000
They express
only love and laughter.

130
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,480
Dark thoughts
are unknown to them.

131
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,880
No! No.

132
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,520
Please.

133
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,480
Lily, no, please!

134
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,280
Come dance, sparrow

135
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,880
Sing me good morning

136
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,080
Rise up, sun

137
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,760
Like the arch of the sky

138
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,440
You'll spook the beast
and spoil the trap.

139
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,280
Living river

140
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,840
Turn the light to diamonds

141
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,600
When I look
in my true love's eyes

142
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,000
Like a child feels

143
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,640
Watching a rainbow

144
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,960
Like a bird feels

145
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,600
The first time it flies

146
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,080
I feel magic

147
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,920
Stirring within me

148
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,880
When I look
in my true love's eyes

149
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,880
Young as any spring

150
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:35,720
His eyes almost seem

151
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,040
This shot be
just as sweet as pie.

152
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,400
Jack? Jack?

153
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,200
Jack!

154
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,440
It was lovely...
like a dream.

155
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,880
What you did is forbidden.

156
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,600
Who says so?

157
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,400
It is known, Lily.
These are sacred animals.

158
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,680
- I don't care.
- You risk your immortal soul
talking like that.

159
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,920
I only wanted to touch one.
Where's the harm in that?

160
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,840
It was magic.

161
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,200
Thank you.

162
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,240
Let me sing to you.

163
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,920
I'll chase your fears away.

164
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,720
In the bumps and the hollows

165
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,760
The sunlight and shadows

166
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,760
He kissed her as those

167
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,880
Bluebells blow

168
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,360
As his lips met her breath

169
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,240
He went sweetly to death

170
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,440
At the roots
of the bluebells

171
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,440
Is where he is laid

172
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,080
Are you afraid
to kiss me, Jack?

173
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,520
I'm afraid
you'll break my heart.

174
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,600
Then still your heart.

175
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,600
You're dear to me
as life itself.

176
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,480
Don't you wish this
was our wedding ring?

177
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,480
If I say yes,
will my wish come true?

178
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,880
I'm a princess.

179
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,400
It's my right to set
a challenge for my suitors.

180
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,840
I will marry...

181
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,000
whoever finds this ring.

182
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,640
Jack!

183
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,000
Lily!

184
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,400
I smell human flesh!

185
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:16,920
- After you, Pig.
- Oh, no, after you.

186
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,840
Clock. Mortal world
turned to ice.

187
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,840
Here be goblin paradise!

188
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,080
Plenty hospitality here.

189
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,880
Baby!

190
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,120
I simply adore milk-fed meat.

191
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,480
What are you,
some kind of animal?

192
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,800
Ohh.

193
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:08,640
- How did you do that, Blix?

194
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,840
Yeah, tell us how
you do those tricks.

195
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,040
Quite easy, actually.

196
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,880
- Goblin omelette.

197
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,840
- Very nice, very nice.

198
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:25,440
Lucky day! Kill
ugly one-horned dead!

199
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,840
You act like you do all.
It was me who shoot
the poisoned stinger.

200
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,560
Me! Me! Me!

201
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,840
You only got the shot in
because the princess was there.

202
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,760
Wrong! 'Twas beauty
led the beast to bay.

203
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,920
She was so sweet.
I could eat her brains like jam.

204
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,280
- I could suck her bones--
- Enough!

205
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,720
Better hurry. Dark Lord,
he don't like to wait.

206
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,280
- Mmmm.

207
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,680
- Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
- What have I done?

208
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,400
Four, five, six!
Hurray for Blix!

209
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,040
I'll make it right.

210
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,360
Lily? Lily?

211
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,600
- Jack?

212
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,600
- Who's there?

213
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,360
Who are you?

214
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,920
Here be forest child
and not know the Gump?

215
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,200
Gump, is it?

216
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,720
Honeythorn Gump
at your service.

217
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,920
I, I must be dreaming.

218
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,920
If life is a dream,
better you dread the waking.

219
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,720
- Jack?
- Stop it!

220
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,280
- That's Oona. She likes you.
- Go away!

221
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,440
Does your blood
run so cold, Jack?

222
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,000
You'll be a gobs
before your time.

223
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,720
How'd you know my name?

224
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,360
How does
a migrating swallow...

225
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,560
know the way south
in winter?

226
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,840
Or a spawning salmon...

227
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,560
find the very source
of his birth...

228
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:30,560
from the cold, black depth
of the mysterious sea?

229
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,120
I know everything, Jack.

230
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,480
Everything?

231
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,240
Then why is it like this?
Why is there winter now?

232
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,480
I'd be a powerful wizard,
indeed, could I answer.

233
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,480
Suppose you tell me, Jack.

234
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,480
Me?

235
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,440
You know these woods
as well as any elf.

236
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,760
Did you not see
something odd today?

237
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,360
Any strange spirits?

238
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,880
Did nothing untoward happen?

239
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,320
No.

240
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:27,200
No? No?
Nothing?

241
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:31,160
Uh, I did take Lily
to see the Unicorns.

242
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,800
- You did what?

243
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,840
Silence!

244
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,520
Oh, God, Gump,
she touched him.

245
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:48,440
Touched it? A mortal
laid hands on a Unicorn?

246
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,360
Jack! Squawk, squawk,
no more talk!

247
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,160
Do you think you can upset
the order of the universe
and not pay the price?

248
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,240
But she meant no wrong!

249
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,840
What I did is done,
but I did it for love.

250
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,280
- Silence!

251
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:19,640
Love, you say?
But answer me this riddle,

252
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,800
and all will be forgiven.

253
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,280
And if I cannot?
Why, Jack,

254
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,400
then 'tis your death song
I'll be playing.

255
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,640
Then ask away...

256
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,760
and pray God
my answer pleases you.

257
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,040
What is a bell
that does not ring...

258
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,080
yet its knell
makes the angels sing?

259
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,760
- Shhh!

260
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,680
Answer me this...

261
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,560
and all will be forgiven.

262
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,560
- Flowers?

263
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,160
Bluebells! To hear them ring
means your life is at an end!

264
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,360
No!

265
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,640
Damn it! Damn it!
Damn it!

266
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,200
Riddles! Riddles!
Riddles!

267
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,480
Damn it! Riddles!
Riddles! Riddles!

268
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,640
Gump?

269
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,720
Gump?

270
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,120
Gump?

271
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,040
You've bested me, Jack.

272
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,320
Bested me, bested me.

273
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,520
A riddle without an answer's
like an empty cup when
you're thirsty for wine.

274
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:38,200
Well spoken!
And if it's wine you want,
it's wine we shall have.

275
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:43,720
Brown Tom! A small measure
of entertainment at best.

276
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,360
But, Gump, it's the last bottle
of me best wine.

277
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,320
Oh-Oh, if you say so, sir.

278
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,560
Mmm.

279
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,680
Now, Gump, don't you
be forgetting me.

280
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,400
Oh, careful now.

281
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,400
Oh, it's so precious.

282
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,400
Elderberry wine.

283
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,520
Sorry.
No finer drink
under heaven.

284
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,920
Here's to Jack,
Oh, brother.

285
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,680
riddle solver, dancing fool
and fairy friend.

286
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,880
Tip it.

287
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,920
Hmm. Ahhh.

288
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:33,400
Here, this'll help.

289
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,720
Don't you care
what's happened?

290
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,440
Of course we care.
What good's a world locked
in a season of death?

291
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,040
But we must find
the answer.
That we must.

292
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,880
But first we must see that
no harm's come to the Unicorn.

293
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,720
I sadly fear the worst.

294
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,360
Wait. Shhh.

295
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,320
Lily!

296
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,960
Jack, what?

297
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,640
Jack!

298
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:27,080
- Forgive me.

299
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,600
I meant no wrong.

300
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,760
Well, Jack, tell us
what has happened.

301
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,680
Come on, Jack.
Don't keep us in the dark.

302
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,040
The dark
is where we'll stay.

303
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,040
We're cursed.

304
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,760
Is there naught
we can do?

305
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,360
We must get
the alicorn back.

306
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,920
Only then will the world
return to normal.

307
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,320
We must find a champion...

308
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,600
bold of heart
and pure in spirit.

309
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,560
Champion? What champion?

310
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,880
Don't give up so quick, lads.

311
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,240
You'll do.

312
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,560
We must get you
some weapons.

313
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,160
But, Gump, I know
nothing of weapons.

314
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,800
You'll learn. I know
where to find the best.

315
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,720
Brown Tom,
stay here with the Unicorn
and guard her well.

316
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,600
Like me own life. Better.
She's the last of her kind.

317
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,240
Magic horn
is mine, mine, mine.

318
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,720
Now all creatures
will love the night...

319
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,240
and worship goblins
as divine.

320
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,080
You shouldn't
talk like that, Blix.

321
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,560
Why not?
I've got the power now.

322
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,840
Plenty big talk.

323
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,320
Hah!

324
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,400
Not even darkness
lasts forever.

325
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,680
Jack, I can't go
with you now.

326
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,120
Anyway, Oona
will guide the way.

327
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,960
Follow me, Jack.
Over here. Come on.

328
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,520
Come on, Jack.

329
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,800
Here, Jack.
Come on.

330
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,040
Oona.

331
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,840
Nobody knows but you.
It's our secret, Jack.

332
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,960
Don't tell Gump. Promise?

333
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,360
Promise!

334
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,640
I could be anything
you want me to be,

335
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,640
even your heart's desire.

336
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,800
You've got to help us, Jack.

337
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,880
The fairies' love
makes anything possible.

338
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:35,680
Higher, higher,
burning fire.

339
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:39,600
Making music like a choir.

340
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,800
It seems a pity
to waste such power.

341
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,680
Waste? Better watch out,
old pal Pox,

342
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,680
or I'll turn you
into little pork chops.

343
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,640
Why not turn everything
into garbage?

344
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,560
A great towering
mountain of slop.

345
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,760
- Wouldn't that be magic?

346
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:01,120
Higher, higher,
burning fire.

347
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:05,360
Making music like a choir.

348
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,480
Blix, Blix. Blix!

349
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,160
- What?
- Big D!

350
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,200
Stop!

351
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,160
Hear me,
you angel of darkness!

352
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,800
Your reign is over!
A new order begins!

353
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,360
- I hold the power!
- Enough!

354
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:40,040
Shit! Please!
It was only a joke.

355
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,560
I didn't mean it.

356
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,560
No! No!

357
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,920
Have you no sense of humor?

358
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,960
Adios, amigos!

359
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,160
Wow.

360
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,400
Forgive that intrusion,
great lord,

361
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:02,680
but goblins are inclined
to be outspoken.

362
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,880
Yeah.
and I like to encourage
their initiative.

363
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,240
Did you think
this a mere plaything?

364
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,880
With it,
my empire is eternal.

365
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,560
Before I ruled
only the night.

366
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:20,080
Now my minions
will frolic in darkness
until the end of time.

367
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,720
The Unicorns are dead,
is this not true?

368
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,600
True, lord,
very plenty true.
Undeniably true.

369
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,560
You lie!
Here is dawn!

370
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,400
It is essentially true.
On the other hand--

371
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,840
Stallion is dead.
Dead as dreams.

372
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,000
- Out with it!
- The mare lives still!

373
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:47,240
If even one Unicorn
walks the earth,
my power is not complete.

374
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,280
She's just a female, lord.
She has no power.

375
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,320
Only the power of creation.

376
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,240
Get the mare!

377
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,280
I command you!

378
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,560
Well, let's see,
what have we here?

379
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,840
Ahh, a little sassafras.

380
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,160
A little spearmint
would be nice, huh?

381
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,800
Some foxglove?

382
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:18,840
And a little colt's foot.

383
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:24,040
Hey, who goes there, what?

384
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,640
I'm-- I'm Princess Lily.

385
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,800
You! You're the cause
of all our sorrow.

386
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:37,760
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

387
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:43,360
I didn't know.
Please, please forgive me.

388
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,600
- I'm not the one
you should be askin'.
- Listen to me.

389
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:51,000
Try and understand.
I'm only trying
to make things right.

390
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:54,000
Darkness has sent the goblins
back for the mare.

391
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:58,480
It's not safe to stay here.
You'll have to hurry!
Leave now! Go!

392
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,320
Good lass. You're
a plucky little partridge.

393
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,480
- Hurry! Aaah!
- Too late!

394
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,920
You imps are lookin'
for a fight, you come to
the chap who'll oblige ya.

395
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,840
Ooh! Ah! Ah!

396
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,720
- Try this on for size.

397
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,720
You can't beat me.
Ha-ha, look at that!

398
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,680
Keep 'em coming, fellas!
Ha-ha!

399
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,680
Oh, check this out!
Yes, sir. You see?

400
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:35,280
You just can't beat me!
You can't--

401
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:39,880
Little tool is stuck.
They done for me.

402
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,120
Quick!

403
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,040
Wait for me!

404
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,360
Brown Tom!

405
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,720
Brown Tom,
you can't be dead.

406
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,280
This is terrible.
Terrible!

407
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,320
Brown Tom.
Brown Tom.

408
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,440
Gump?

409
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,640
Screwball.

410
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,240
Jack, lad.

411
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:31,840
- They killed you too?
- Of course they didn't.

412
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,720
- But what in blazes
are you talking about?
- Goblins.

413
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:39,160
- Goblins?
- Shot me through me brain pan.

414
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,600
Oh.

415
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,320
That's one spot an arrow
will do no harm.

416
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,920
I did my best to fight 'em off,
but they swarmed up
by the hundreds.

417
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,840
All fierce creatures they were.
The princess warned me, but--

418
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,920
Lily?
Aye.

419
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,920
Then she's alive!

420
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,920
She was alive still
when they killed me.

421
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,600
The goblins
must have taken her.

422
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,120
We follow their tracks
in the snow.

423
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,000
The Great Tree.

424
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:16,320
When evil anarchy
ruled the land,

425
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:19,600
the wicked came here
to sacrifice.

426
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,520
Ugly. I hate it.

427
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,200
Good. You go first.

428
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,800
Why always me?

429
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,440
Go!

430
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,680
Foreigner.

431
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:15,240
Ooh, slippery.

432
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,240
Uh, uh--

433
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,080
Oh, okay, okay.

434
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,280
I made it!

435
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:43,280
Screwball!

436
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,040
Foul-tasting fairy!

437
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,640
Come to Meg, juicy boy.

438
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,640
Who be this tender morsel...

439
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:20,480
disturbing
Meg Mucklebone's rest?

440
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:24,640
Jack.
They call me Jack, ma'am.

441
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:32,000
And what a fine,
fat boy you are, Jack.

442
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,400
You don't really mean
to eat me, do you, ma'am?

443
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,920
Oh, indeed I do!

444
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,520
But that would be a shame,
because someone as fair...

445
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,840
and lovely as yourself,
Miss Meg, deserves far better
than scrawny me.

446
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,920
Don't you think?

447
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,640
You think me fair,
do you, Jack?

448
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,760
All the heavenly angels
must envy your beauty.

449
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,600
What a fine meal
you'll make,

450
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,760
be the rest of you
as sweet as your tongue.

451
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,840
- Wait! No!

452
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:24,160
Your Loveliness,
feast on the beauty
of your reflection.

453
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,720
You are an angel, Miss Meg.

454
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,160
Look. Look.
Ohhh.

455
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,880
What a splendid idea.

456
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,320
Clever boy!

457
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:45,560
Yes.

458
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:49,880
Your alchemy makes
crusted steel shine like silver.

459
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,240
That's discerning taste...

460
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,360
for one so young, Jack.

461
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:06,240
Come. Come, Jack!

462
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:09,360
Give us a kiss...
before dining!

463
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,560
I did it!

464
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,720
- Screwball!

465
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:00,120
Oh, okay. Okay.

466
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:04,000
Oh! Whee! Look.

467
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,640
What a big trumpet!
I'll bet it makes a lot of noise.

468
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,440
Our lives are lost if it blows.

469
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,200
Hmm.

470
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,280
Mm-hmm.

471
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,080
Mm-hmm.

472
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,720
Oh!

473
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,720
I think it stopped.

474
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:45,080
Look out!

475
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:56,280
My back! Me achin' back!

476
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:00,200
Oh, I'm not as old
as I used to be, you know.

477
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:06,640
Ooh. Hey, where are we?

478
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,640
Someplace
we don't want to be.

479
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:16,560
Hey, hey!
Wait for me!

480
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:20,440
We gotta get out of here!
It's the stench of hell itself!

481
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,280
Shh! Quiet!

482
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:29,680
You'll be fricasseed fairies
if you don't keep quiet.

483
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,000
Who be you, bucket head?

484
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:35,360
Who I am won't help me
nor you, neither,

485
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,760
even though
we are all brothers.

486
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,920
What happened to you?

487
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,920
It's a long story.

488
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,120
Let's just say
I went looking for adventure...

489
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:53,240
and found
more than I could handle.

490
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:56,960
Doesn't matter now anyway.

491
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:00,280
We are all in the same fix!

492
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:05,360
I knew it. I knew it.
I should have stayed at home.

493
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,800
Let's face it, brothers.

494
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:12,920
Me and you all...
is barbecue.

495
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,480
Barbecue?
That's right. Barbecue.

496
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:22,440
Only dead meat waits
for the stew pot.

497
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,960
Spring the lock
with your magic, Gump.

498
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,320
Ooh!
Ah!

499
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,200
Iron is trouble for elves.

500
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,200
Iron, huh?

501
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,800
Oh!

502
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,280
Oh, no!

503
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,280
The thing!

504
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:15,920
Oh, no!
He's coming! Hide!

505
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,440
Hide!
Hide! Hide!

506
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:22,440
- Oh!

507
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,200
I don't think I can handle it!
Help me!

508
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,600
Let me go! Let me go!

509
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:07,880
Help! Help me!

510
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,240
Please! Please!

511
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,720
Help me!

512
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:17,480
Oh, you beast!
Help me!

513
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,640
Let me go!

514
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,360
Ah... ah... ah...

515
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,120
ah... ah... achoo!

516
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,360
Gump, we've got to help him.

517
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:43,360
Oh, don't worry.
Our brother can take care
of himself.

518
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,400
I'm sure of it,
I think.

519
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,120
Screwball's right.
It's more important
that you find the Unicorn.

520
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:53,640
Why not have Oona fly out,
find a key?

521
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:58,160
Oona?
But she's much too small.

522
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,200
Could never lift it.

523
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:02,920
Our secret!

524
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,640
Our secret will keep forever
in this grave if you don't help us.

525
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:08,800
- You promised!

526
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:12,960
You willful sprite.
How dare you keep such secrets?

527
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:15,360
They're mine to keep.

528
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:25,720
I'll do what you ask...
if you'll kiss me, Jack.

529
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,160
Easy enough.

530
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:48,000
You call that a kiss?
Am I not sweet?

531
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:54,160
Sweeter than bee pollen...

532
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,200
on a summer wind.

533
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:01,360
Sweet as the wind
that blows me to you.

534
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:07,600
Oh, it's fairy magic.

535
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,200
Lily?

536
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,720
- Lily?
- Yes, Jack.

537
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,440
This isn't real.

538
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:29,280
Oh, it is.

539
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:32,240
I'm warm and alive...

540
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:34,760
and want to be in your arms.

541
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:01,280
No, l, I can't. No.

542
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,760
This is just
more fairy glamour.

543
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,640
Human hearts
don't work that way.

544
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:12,240
What care I
for human hearts?

545
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:15,360
Soft and spiritless
as porridge!

546
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:19,080
A fairy's heart beats
fierce and free!

547
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:29,560
Oona!

548
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:33,880
Your fine sensibilities
have left us here to rot!

549
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,720
I'm behind you all the way, Gump.

550
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:44,880
You look like mourners
at your own funeral.

551
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,400
Oona!

552
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,880
Quick, lads!

553
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,880
You!

554
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:11,480
You mortal, you!

555
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:16,320
I could vex you!
Dance your life away!

556
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:34,040
Uh, I'll stay here and--

557
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:36,920
- Ahh! Wait for me!

558
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:57,960
A terrible sight
for a sober man.

559
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:11,320
Shh!
We must find the dungeons.

560
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:15,320
I think I'll stay right here,
thank you very much.

561
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,320
You'll search
with the rest of us.

562
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,840
Then I'll go with Jack.
No! We split up.

563
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,360
Yes! It's better
if we go in teams.

564
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,160
- No, I will go with Ja--
- Shh!

565
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:27,600
Gump and me,
Brown Tom and Screwball.

566
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,600
Right. Let's synchronize.

567
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:32,800
Oh!

568
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:41,160
Oh! A-ha!

569
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:46,160
We meet back here in twice
500 beats of a bluebird's heart.

570
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:49,520
Do you know what I think?
I think we should add a couple
more hundred breaths of a--

571
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:51,560
Shh!

572
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,960
Take care.
Come on, Jack.

573
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,000
Be careful.

574
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:08,960
There's only one thing
I want to know.
What?

575
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:11,400
Why me?
Shh!

576
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:15,040
I think we should go west.
I think we should go east.

577
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:17,040
Oh, okay.
Wait!

578
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:24,040
Father, I hold the world
in my grasp,

579
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:29,520
and yet this girl...
distracts me.

580
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:33,800
It has been an eternity
since I felt such desire.

581
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,360
What am I to do?

582
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:42,040
She fascinates you
because her soul is pure.

583
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:45,000
I'll take her then.
Fool!

584
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:49,920
You must woo her!

585
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,800
She remembers the world
as it was,

586
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:58,960
so... tempt her.

587
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:02,200
Win her.

588
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:06,320
Make her one of us.

589
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:23,600
Hmm. Hey. Psst!

590
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:26,600
Psst! Psst!

591
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,600
Did, did you see something?

592
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:31,800
No, did you?
I don't know.

593
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,800
I think.

594
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,320
D-D-D-Did you hear that?

595
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,320
What's that?

596
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,320
That's a horse,
you idiot.

597
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:36,440
Woo her.

598
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:39,400
Woo her.

599
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:21,400
Win her.

600
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:31,040
Woo her, win her.

601
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:59,920
Make her one of us.

602
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:22,520
Lady, do not be afraid.

603
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:27,840
Quiet, quiet.

604
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,680
How like you my gifts?

605
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:36,440
Does the gown
not please you?

606
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,600
No.

607
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:47,080
Can you speak so
of your bridal gown?

608
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,680
I've found my true mate,

609
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:52,280
and you know it.

610
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:57,960
- Never.
- Beneath the skin,
we are already one.

611
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:03,480
Was it not your sin
trapped the Unicorn?

612
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:06,240
- No.
- Even now...

613
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:09,000
the evil seed
of what you have done...

614
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:12,480
germinates within you.

615
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,640
No. You lie.

616
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:18,240
You disgust me.

617
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,240
You're nothing
but an animal.

618
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:27,720
We are all animals,
my lady.

619
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:31,160
Most are too afraid
to see it.

620
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,680
- Lily!
- Jack.

621
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:53,320
There's nothing
you can do now to help her.

622
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:56,000
Be thankful she still lives.

623
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,000
You've got to help us,
Jack.

624
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:02,160
The last Unicorn dies
tonight.

625
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:06,760
- As her blood ebbs,
- Never.

626
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:10,000
the sun sets forever.

627
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:15,480
There shall never be
another dawn.

628
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:17,800
No!

629
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:23,360
Lady, I require the solace
of the shadows...

630
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:27,360
and the dark of the night.

631
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:31,880
Sunshine is my destroyer!

632
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,720
Damn you!

633
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:44,920
We are all of us damned,
my queen.

634
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:50,920
As long as the sun still shines,

635
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
we can destroy him.

636
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:56,760
Let me dazzle you
with my wisdom.

637
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:01,240
I think I know a way.

638
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:09,360
Come on, come on, come on.
You're holding us up.

639
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:12,640
Listen. We're not going down
the same corridor umpteen times.

640
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:15,040
I think we should go that way.
No, we're going this way.

641
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,040
No, not me.

642
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:24,680
Let's go down there.
Stay close to me now.

643
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,800
You know what?
What?

644
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,920
I vote we run like hell.
I second the motion.

645
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,760
Screwball.

646
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:56,480
Where were you?

647
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:00,840
In another three flicks
of a badger's tail,
we would have gone.

648
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:03,600
While you're having fun,
time goes by fast.

649
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:07,440
Yeah, we found the mare,
and it's alive in the dungeon.

650
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,480
Excellent.
Excellent, you two!

651
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:11,760
Thank you very much.

652
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:14,680
Now Jack has a plan,
and a good one!

653
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:18,160
We must gather every
shining object we can find.

654
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:22,000
We're going to bring light
to darkness.

655
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,680
Blunder.

656
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:18,920
Blunder!

657
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,120
Shh!

658
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:23,920
Any more noise,
and you're shish kebab.

659
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:26,680
You do what we say, understand?
Swear it.

660
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:31,560
I swear it on the festering
forelock of Nicodemus!

661
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:35,440
Please, help. Help me.

662
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:40,080
Thank you.

663
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:47,400
Judge me not so harshly,
mistress.

664
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:50,560
I invite you
to share this supper.

665
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:53,880
Look how sweet it is.

666
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:59,920
Hurry, hurry.
Keep 'em comin'!
Come on, come on!

667
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:20,400
- Ow!

668
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,200
- Brown Tom!
- Huh?

669
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:11,840
Gump? Gump!

670
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:18,640
Gump?
Jack. Jack!

671
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,880
Three cheers
for our champion!

672
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:27,320
Hip hip!
Hooray!

673
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,640
- Hip hip!
- Hooray!

674
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:31,440
Hip hip!
Hooray!

675
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,200
Now what, Jack?

676
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,360
Must go all the way out.

677
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:06,040
Light.

678
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:10,160
Not much to hold on to.

679
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:13,400
Take a pea pod pixie
to make that climb.

680
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:21,840
I'll do it.

681
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,240
What's the matter?
Ain't I small enough
for the job?

682
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:30,680
No job is too small
for my little brother.

683
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:34,680
Please, Gump. Let me try.
I won't let you down.

684
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:38,920
All right, all right.
Do it, but be swift!

685
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,520
Oh, thank you, thank you.
You'll never regret it.

686
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:46,600
I always knew you'd
be going places, Screwball.
Yes.

687
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:54,080
Uh--

688
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,320
- Eat.
- I'm not hungry.

689
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:59,160
You lie.

690
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:03,240
Just to please me.

691
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:05,800
I do nothing
for your pleasure.

692
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:11,640
All I wish...

693
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:15,840
is for you to sit
and talk with me.

694
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:18,280
Sit?

695
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:23,840
- Here?
- Yes.

696
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:25,840
Please.

697
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:28,520
- I prefer to stand.
- Sit!

698
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:35,920
Or stand.
As you wish.

699
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,600
It is enough that
we are alone together.

700
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:44,280
Just the two of us.

701
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:53,440
Some... simple conversation.

702
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:57,360
I have nothing
to talk about.

703
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:01,680
You've stolen my dreams away.

704
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,840
All things change, Lady.

705
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:08,280
The dreams of youth...

706
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:11,520
are the regrets of maturity.

707
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:17,360
Dreams are my specialty.

708
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:21,360
Through dreams
I influence mankind.

709
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:24,520
My dream...

710
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:28,040
is of eternity with you.

711
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:35,240
I offer you this rose,
Princess--

712
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:40,000
my heart,

713
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:43,000
my soul,

714
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:46,120
my love.

715
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:48,360
Love?

716
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:07,520
Once I was content
with solitude...

717
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:10,160
until that moment...

718
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:14,000
I felt your vivid presence.

719
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:17,280
A little to the right.

720
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:20,200
Left. Good!

721
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:26,800
It grows late. Sit.

722
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:29,880
I value your thoughts.

723
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:32,600
Share them with me.

724
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:14,840
Sit?
Yes.

725
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:17,760
- Nothing more than that?
- And talk with me.

726
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:32,040
I think I'll stand,
if you don't mind.

727
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:37,160
Damn you!

728
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:40,440
No! Never! Never!

729
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:03,440
I hear a throat
begging to be cut.

730
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:14,280
Are you so... anxious...

731
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,320
to see blood flow?

732
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:20,600
As you are to drink it.
Grant your bride one wish
on this night.

733
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:22,600
You have but to ask.

734
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:24,960
I will stay here with you
as you wish.

735
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,840
- But on one condition.
- Anything.

736
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:35,800
I want to kill the Unicorn.

737
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:57,320
I can't let that happen.

738
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:09,320
In the beginning...

739
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:12,040
there was nothing--

740
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:18,560
a void of darkness,

741
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:22,880
a cold eternity
of silence.

742
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:28,720
Jack, your greatest challenge
is still to come.

743
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:31,600
And we have not much time.

744
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:44,520
When the perfect void
was corrupted...

745
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:46,520
by light,

746
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:49,760
a great wailing was heard,

747
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:54,520
and all the brethren fled
in terror.

748
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:57,320
Gump!

749
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:59,640
Oona, fly up like the wind.

750
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:01,640
It's time.

751
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:09,960
Jack!

752
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:16,680
Lily.
Jack.

753
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:19,960
Judge her with your heart,

754
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:22,120
not your eyes.

755
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:25,640
Hear me,

756
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:28,640
ye powers of the night!

757
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:32,480
We offer this sacrifice,

758
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,240
in honor of you,

759
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:40,280
sanctified with blood...

760
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:45,360
and with fire!

761
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:59,360
I pray you, Father,

762
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:02,080
accept my sacrifice.

763
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:08,080
Let light
be forever extinguished.

764
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:13,520
Let the age of darkness begin!

765
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:16,080
Come, Lady.

766
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:20,920
The birth of a new world
awaits your stroke.

767
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:26,720
Let my offering be made
of flesh and blood.

768
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:31,880
She means to do it, Jack.
She's one of them.

769
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:34,400
I am sister to the Fates.

770
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:37,520
Kill her. Forget her.

771
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:40,880
Think about the Unicorn.

772
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:51,400
- Do it!
- Lily.

773
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:55,920
- I'll do it.
- No! No.

774
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:03,000
- I trust you, Lily.

775
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:05,440
I'll always trust you.

776
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:10,840
Run!

777
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:14,000
Run! You're free!

778
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,680
Darkness!

779
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:49,720
What have we here?

780
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:52,240
A little boy.

781
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:21,320
Screwball!
Screwball, wake up!

782
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:38,120
Wake up, Screwball!
Wake up!

783
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:43,360
It's always a pleasure
to take a brave man's life.

784
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:49,240
Wake up!

785
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:21,720
Don't you know me, boy?

786
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,280
Quickly!
What time is it?

787
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:48,360
Every wolf suffers fleas.

788
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:51,240
'Tis easy enough to scratch.

789
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:08,960
Give it to me, boy!

790
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:32,760
Father!

791
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:35,880
Protect me!

792
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:49,960
You think you have won!

793
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:54,520
What is light...

794
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:56,520
without dark?

795
01:40:58,040 --> 01:41:00,240
What are you...

796
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:03,560
without me?

797
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:10,360
I am a part of you all.

798
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:15,120
You can never defeat me.

799
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:17,560
We are brothers...

800
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:19,360
eternal!

801
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:22,200
Do it, Jack! Kill him!

802
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:24,560
Kill him!

803
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:09,840
She's under a spell.

804
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:12,400
A powerful spell.

805
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:15,600
Do something.

806
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:20,440
Look what we've been through.

807
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:24,520
Look who you are.

808
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:26,800
Have faith in yourself.

809
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:30,560
It is the greatest lesson
you have learned.

810
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:32,960
Only you
can answer this riddle.

811
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:37,280
I'm a princess.

812
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:40,960
It's my right to set
a challenge for my suitors.

813
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:45,800
I will marry...
whoever finds this ring.

814
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:50,800
We too have
a promise to keep.

815
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:55,480
Now fulfill your promise.

816
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:58,960
I will miss you.

817
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:02,040
But don't forget us.
Never.

818
01:44:57,880 --> 01:45:00,240
I love you, Lily.

819
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:03,720
Come back to me.

820
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:08,200
Come back to me.

821
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:21,200
I... love you, Jack.

822
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:40,320
I love you, Lily.

823
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:44,120
I had such a terrible
nightmare.

824
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:46,640
Did you?

825
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:50,400
It's over.

826
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:09,000
Jack, was it all a dream?

827
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:11,800
You're safe now.

828
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:19,320
So many terrible things
happened.

829
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:21,760
I--

830
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:26,240
I learned something
about myself...

831
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:28,520
and something about you.

832
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:30,880
What's that?

833
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:33,880
You belong here.

834
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:36,480
You're my prince.

835
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:41,240
I'm only Jack.

836
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:43,760
My Lord Jack.

837
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:26,480
So you take that...

838
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:29,000
and you keep it,
treasure it.

839
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:32,880
It's part of me.

840
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:40,360
Can I come tomorrow?

841
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:42,360
Of course.

842
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:46,360
I'll be here.

843
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:48,840
I'll always be here
for you, Lily.

844
01:47:55,640 --> 01:47:57,560
Will you sing for me?

845
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:03,560
Come down, sparrow

846
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:05,920
Sing me good morning

847
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:10,280
Rise up, sun
like the arch of the sky

848
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:12,400
Living river

849
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:15,000
Turn light to diamonds

850
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:18,680
When I look
in my true love's eyes
