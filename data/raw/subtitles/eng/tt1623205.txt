1
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,533
Hurry, hurry, step this way.
Get your tickets now.

2
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,370
Don't be shut out, friend.
Step this way.

3
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,080
See the most wondrous sights imaginable,

4
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:46,125
pulled from the four corners of the Earth.

5
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:50,379
Acts to delight, to thrill and to mystify!

6
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:52,756
Walk through these gates
and into a world of wonder!

7
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:57,970
She is here, ladies and gents,
live and in person.

8
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:03,017
That gun-slinging, sharp-shooting
honey-pie of the Wild West.

9
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:06,770
He has travelled the world and
baffled the crown princes of Europe.

10
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,315
He will amaze! He will astound!

11
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:13,277
The Great and Powerful Oz!

12
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,405
I always knew that I was destined
for show business.

13
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:20,409
And now look at me.
A magician's assistant.

14
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:24,872
To think, an hour ago I was just
selling oil cakes on the midway.

15
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,334
Yes, opportunity comes
when you least expect it, my dear.

16
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:34,548
Wow! What a get-up.

17
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:40,429
You won't need this.
You are playing the simple country girl.

18
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:50,731
A gift in honour of your debut.

19
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,902
Now, this belonged to my grandmother.

20
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:59,573
A tsarina from Mirkutsk,
and a decorated war hero.

21
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:00,699
Your grandmother?

22
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:04,119
Yes. She was killed in battle,
the poor thing.

23
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:05,371
Which battle?

24
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,164
Which battle?

25
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,083
Well, there are so many.

26
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,086
You've heard of the Battle of Kreplach?

27
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,170
No.

28
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:15,422
No? Good. That's where she died.

29
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:19,927
And this music box
was the only thing to survive.

30
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:29,436
But I know that Grammie
would want you to have it.

31
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:31,355
Professor.

32
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,692
Frank! The sock is on the door.
We're rehearsing.

33
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,777
How many times do
I have to tell you to knock?

34
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,445
Knock.

35
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:53,294
I knocked.

36
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:54,837
- What is it?
- Showtime.

37
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:56,005
Why didn't you say something?

38
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,882
Only a half a house. Here's the take.

39
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:04,930
Pitiful.

40
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,438
All right, this is your cut.

41
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,569
For you, the applause
will be approbation enough.

42
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,743
Well, how do you think I feel?

43
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:30,122
A man of my talents, I should
be playing the Orpheum Circuit!

44
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,166
Instead of some dusty Podunk...

45
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:36,045
in a second-hand jacket
falling apart at the seams.

46
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,463
You're gonna have to patch
this thing again.

47
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:38,881
- Again?
- Yeah.

48
00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:41,258
Let's go. Hat!

49
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,135
Hat.

50
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:45,721
You're the new girl, huh?

51
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:46,805
Yes.

52
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:49,767
Good, we needed a new one.
The last one left us.

53
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:52,770
Poor thing.
Suffered from a broken heart.

54
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,980
Attack. Heart attack.

55
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,400
But she's resting comfortably
now in Abilene...

56
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,319
expected to make a full recovery.

57
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:02,529
Perhaps you'd like to join her.

58
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,450
Now, remember,
when I ask for a volunteer...

59
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,243
I raise my hand.

60
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,288
You are overqualified for this job,
my dear.

61
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,624
Let's go make some magic.

62
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,627
Ladies and gentlemen,
the show has already begun.

63
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,670
There are still a few seats left.

64
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,882
Don't miss your chance to see
Oz, the Great and Powerful!

65
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,593
Journey with me now,
across those deserts...

66
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,181
to the mystical lands
of the Arabian Peninsula.

67
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,898
For 5,000 years...

68
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:42,569
her lonely spirit has been trapped.

69
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:47,574
But tonight, we will attempt to free her.

70
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:52,162
I shall require a volunteer
from the audience.

71
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,165
Anyone.

72
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,586
Anyone.

73
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:09,513
How about you, madam?

74
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,099
Yes, I would like to volunteer.

75
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:16,478
How kind of you. Please.

76
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,523
Just remember what I told you.

77
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,277
A simple country girl,
ladies and gentlemen.

78
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:30,117
Now, you have nothing to fear,
just so long as you believe.

79
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,703
For when you do believe...

80
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,456
anything is possible.

81
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:43,797
You are growing sleepy.

82
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:49,386
Your eyelids become heavy.

83
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,389
Sleep!

84
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:00,898
Come, Fernanda!

85
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:08,322
Allow yourself to merge
with this woman before me.

86
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:19,082
Can you hear me, oh Queen Fernanda?

87
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,251
Yes.

88
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,339
Then rise.

89
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:31,094
Rise!

90
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,391
I command you to rise!

91
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:59,581
Rise from your tomb of sand.

92
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,293
Rise as your spirit...

93
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,920
I see a wire!

94
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,426
You are mistaken, sir.

95
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,512
I am not!

96
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,641
There is a wire!
There is a wire holding her up!

97
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:18,976
A wire?

98
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,353
I see it, too. It's right there.

99
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:24,690
Clear as day. Can't you see 'em?

100
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,443
He's fooling us.

101
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,988
A wire!

102
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:37,536
What need have I of wires? Frank.

103
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,058
Make me walk!

104
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,811
What's that?

105
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,398
Make me walk.

106
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,193
Not now, kid.
Let us leave the wonders...

107
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,530
But I believe in you.

108
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,537
Look, it's not much,
but it's all that we have.

109
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,332
Whatever you could do.

110
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:30,172
I would make you walk, it's just...

111
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,132
It's just that...

112
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,092
Go on, then. Make the girl walk.

113
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,594
Make the kid walk.

114
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,512
Come on, you big phoney.

115
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,222
Yeah, come on!

116
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:42,434
I would make her walk, of course...

117
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:45,562
but unfortunately there is
a distemper in the ether tonight.

118
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:47,898
Make the kid walk, you big phoney.

119
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:49,232
You see?

120
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:51,568
I'm sorry, but...

121
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,529
Thank you. Thank you.

122
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:57,240
Oz, the Great and Powerful.

123
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,537
Why didn't you close
the damn curtain sooner?

124
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,039
I was dying out there.

125
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:06,208
There was nothing you could have done.

126
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,751
I didn't really think it was that bad.

127
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:10,879
Of course not.
You're just a trained monkey.

128
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:18,929
You know, you shouldn't be
so mean to me all the time, Professor.

129
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,931
After all, I'm the only friend you've got.

130
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,599
Friend?

131
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:26,645
You're not my friend, Frank.
I don't need a friend.

132
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:32,526
What I need is someone who knows
when to close the damn curtain.

133
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:37,322
It's a woman.

134
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,991
Finally some good news.

135
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:43,286
You want me to wind up a music box?

136
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,956
No.

137
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,334
Not for this one, Frank.

138
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,505
Hey, Annie.

139
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,134
Hello, Oscar.

140
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:04,641
You look lovely.

141
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:06,643
Thank you.

142
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,187
What is this? Gingham?

143
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,149
You know it is.

144
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,318
It was a wonderful show.

145
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,113
Don't tell me you watched that debacle.

146
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,992
I don't know why you didn't
just tell that poor girl the truth.

147
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,954
What truth? That I'm a fake?
They would have had my head.

148
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:29,166
And worse, they would have
demanded a refund.

149
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:30,959
Come on, have a seat.

150
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,963
I'll get you some tea.

151
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:43,388
It's been a long time.
I haven't seen you since...

152
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:45,307
The last time you rolled into town.

153
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,644
It's not often enough, Oscar,
seeing you once every few months.

154
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:53,190
Well, it is a travelling circus.

155
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:57,194
How's everything on the farm?
How's your ma?

156
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,863
She didn't send me a pie this time.
I hope she's not mad.

157
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,031
I meant to write.

158
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:03,325
I need to tell you something, Oscar.

159
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:05,869
That's never a good start
to a conversation.

160
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,872
John Gale asked me to marry him.

161
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,252
That's why I've come.

162
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,506
I thought you should know.

163
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:28,099
I think that's wonderful, Annie.

164
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,727
I said I had to think about it.

165
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,690
Men love that answer.

166
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,530
I wondered what you thought I should do.

167
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:49,287
You could do a lot worse than John Gale.

168
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,415
He's a good man.

169
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,709
So are you.

170
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,253
No.

171
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,880
I'm not.

172
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,925
I'm many things,
but a good man is not one of them.

173
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:05,428
But you could be.

174
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,765
If you wanted to.

175
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,102
That's just it.

176
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,604
I don't want to.

177
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:19,234
See, Kansas is full of good men.

178
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:24,072
Church-going men
that get married and raise families.

179
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:26,616
Men like John Gale.

180
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,827
Men like my father...

181
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,831
who spent his whole
life tilling the dirt...

182
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:35,834
just to die facedown in it.

183
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,962
I don't want that, Annie.

184
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:43,758
I don't want to be a good man,
I want to be a great one.

185
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:48,597
I want to be Harry Houdini
and Thomas Edison...

186
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,807
all rolled into one.

187
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,532
That's all I ever wanted for you, you know.

188
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,703
Greatness.

189
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:15,290
Then you understand.

190
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:16,875
I do.

191
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,128
But do you?

192
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,423
Professor, you need to look outside.

193
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,347
No, Vlad, please.
It was his grandmother's.

194
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,892
I'm gonna rip him in half!

195
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,771
- No, please!
- Get off!

196
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:41,024
It was just his grandmother's music box.
It meant nothing.

197
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,233
Oz!

198
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,236
I have to go.

199
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,614
Congratulations on the engagement.

200
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:49,282
Oscar.

201
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,451
I'll see you in my dreams.

202
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,376
Oz!

203
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,544
I'm gonna rip your head off!

204
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,547
Zim Zallah Bim!

205
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:15,976
Oz!

206
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:22,983
There he is! He's out here!

207
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,110
No, Vlad! Don't hurt him!

208
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:26,903
Vlad!

209
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,405
Vlad, no!

210
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,492
I'm gonna crush you, Oz!

211
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,122
I'm gonna crush you!

212
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,581
Oz! Where are you going?

213
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:41,626
Mr Baum,
I'll catch up with you in Milwaukee.

214
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,586
Half of that balloon is mine!

215
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,296
And the other half is mine!

216
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:49,259
All right, you loafers!
Roll up those tents!

217
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,141
Oz!

218
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,187
- No, no, no.
- You're not getting away!

219
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:02,605
Where's my thing?

220
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,527
Come here. Get him down, Clowny.

221
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,824
No, you don't! No, you don't!

222
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:22,959
So long, sucker!

223
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:24,210
Get back here!

224
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,296
Oz!

225
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:28,339
Oz, you2re gonna need these!

226
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,300
Throw it! Now!

227
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,635
- Hat!
- Hat!

228
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,140
You're a dead man!

229
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:40,310
Farewell! <i>Au revoir! Auf Wiedersehen!</i>

230
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:58,536
No, no, no!

231
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:46,126
Please, I don't wanna die!

232
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,294
I haven't accomplished anything yet!

233
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,881
Just get me out of here
and I'll do great things!

234
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,968
Please! Give me a chance!

235
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,719
I promise!

236
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,597
I promise. I can change.

237
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:44,494
Thank you. Thank you!

238
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,027
Come on, come on!

239
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,822
Come on, come on!

240
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:34,831
No, no. Come on, buddy.

241
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:39,669
I can't swim. No! I can't swim.

242
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:46,551
Somebody, help me!

243
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:25,381
Thank goodness.

244
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:28,509
I thought I was dead.

245
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,556
Unless you're an angel.
Am I in heaven?

246
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:39,020
There is still hope for me!

247
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,063
You won't regret this!

248
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,399
I saw you fall from the sky.

249
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:49,530
Yes, my balloon hit an inverted thermal.
I couldn't compensate.

250
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,908
I'd get out of the water if I were you.

251
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:55,036
It's actually quite nice.

252
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:57,246
I'd be more concerned
with the River Fairies.

253
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,916
Their teeth are small, but very sharp.

254
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,960
River Fairies? What's a River Fairy?

255
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:06,881
Get off!

256
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:17,266
Go on, get out of here.

257
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:34,825
Spiteful little things, aren't they?

258
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:39,914
Where am I, exactly?

259
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:41,832
Where do you think you are?

260
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,794
I have no idea.

261
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,464
It's like no place I've ever seen.

262
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:50,591
You're in Oz.

263
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:52,593
Oz?

264
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:55,846
But that's my name.

265
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:59,475
Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman
Henkle Emmanuel Ambroise Diggs.

266
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:03,813
But everyone calls me Oz.

267
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:10,987
I knew it. The king's prophecy was true.

268
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,447
He said that a great wizard
bearing the name of our land...

269
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:16,659
will descend from the heavens,
and save us all.

270
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:18,619
And here you are.

271
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:20,496
Here to claim your throne.

272
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:21,998
"Claim my throne"?

273
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:24,667
You mean, like a king's throne?

274
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:27,378
Yes. Because you will be our king.

275
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,297
Your king?

276
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:32,675
Like, in a palace with
a crown and a sceptre?

277
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:36,637
Yes, a beautiful sceptre
and a grand palace.

278
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:39,473
And you will save all the people.

279
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:42,184
Was that a gold sceptre?

280
00:26:43,311 --> 00:26:46,397
Yes, there's more gold
than you could ever imagine.

281
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:49,859
And Oz will now be what it once was.

282
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:54,030
Because you are the Wizard, aren't you?

283
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:58,909
Yes.

284
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:00,870
I'm the Wizard.

285
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,546
What was that?

286
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:13,424
The Wicked Witch's minions.
They've been sent here to kill you.

287
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:14,717
Kill me?

288
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:16,719
A wicked witch? What?

289
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:21,223
We better hurry, or your reign
will be over before it's begun!

290
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:37,073
Come on!

291
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:42,578
In there!

292
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:45,748
Give me your leg.

293
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:07,436
Perhaps the Wicked Witch
has summoned them back.

294
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:10,481
I don't think I like witches.

295
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:14,110
What?

296
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:17,113
I, too, am a witch.

297
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,323
I am Theodora the Good.

298
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:22,952
You're not a witch.

299
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,120
Of course I am.

300
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:26,831
Where are all your warts?
Where's your broom?

301
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:29,125
What would I do with a broom?

302
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:30,334
Fly.

303
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:32,128
With a broom?

304
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,547
Never mind.

305
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:23,679
You were afraid?

306
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,181
Yes.

307
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:30,603
That something might happen to you.

308
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,204
So, this Wicked Witch...

309
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,039
just how wicked is she?

310
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:51,707
She's as wicked as they come.

311
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,542
She poisoned her own father.

312
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:54,835
That's pretty wicked.

313
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:57,421
He was a king and a wizard, like you.

314
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:59,715
But she wanted the throne all to herself.

315
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:01,258
Poor man.

316
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:05,221
But my sister chased her away
from the Emerald City.

317
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,473
I can't wait for her to meet you.

318
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,559
She was starting to doubt
you'd ever come, but now she'll see.

319
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,062
And you're going to fix everything.

320
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:15,606
Yeah.

321
00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:41,590
You know what I think we need?

322
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:48,973
A little music.

323
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,267
Is that magic?

324
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:52,434
In a way.

325
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:57,064
It's a music box.
You've never seen one?

326
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:02,236
This belonged to my grandmother.
A tsarina from Mirkutsk.

327
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:05,447
Go on.

328
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:09,076
I want you to have it.

329
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:15,457
No one's ever given me anything
just because they wanted to.

330
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,334
A pretty girl like you?

331
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:19,837
With the visage of Helen of Troy, no less?

332
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,006
I'm sure you have dozens of admirers.

333
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:24,091
You don't know much about witches, do you?

334
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:27,511
Maybe not, but I'm told I'm a fast learner.

335
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,097
May I have this dance, milady?

336
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:34,727
Now you're gonna tell me no one's
ever asked you to dance before.

337
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:36,979
No one ever has.

338
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:40,149
Then it's high time that you learned.

339
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,910
Put your hand here.

340
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:54,371
And your other hand here.

341
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:10,846
Nice, isn't it?

342
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:13,891
Yes.

343
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,054
- It's incredible.
- Yeah.

344
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:54,556
Here I thought I'd live a lonely life...

345
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,809
and then you showed up.

346
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:00,062
Not only are you the Wizard...

347
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:03,816
but you're the person I belong with.

348
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:07,903
Well, we sure get along. And...

349
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,571
And?

350
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:12,324
And...

351
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:15,661
Like you said, we belong together.

352
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:18,080
I was hoping you would say that.

353
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:19,581
Yeah.

354
00:33:20,124 --> 00:33:21,625
Help me!

355
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,335
Somebody, save me!

356
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:25,754
That poor little creature.

357
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:29,258
Wizard, we must save him.

358
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:30,759
Somebody, help me.

359
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:32,302
Oh, no, no, no.

360
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,263
Allow the Wizard.

361
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:35,764
Come on!

362
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:42,062
Of course I'll save this little talking
monkey in a bellhop's uniform.

363
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:45,065
You, mister! Please, hurry up.

364
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:47,735
Do you have anything sharp?
Like a knife or something.

365
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:49,903
How about your teeth?
What kind of teeth you got?

366
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:53,282
Calm down, it's gonna be all right.

367
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:54,450
You gotta get me out of these vines.

368
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:55,993
Calm down.

369
00:33:56,744 --> 00:33:58,954
I'm gonna die. It's gonna eat me.

370
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:02,166
Don't worry.
These vines aren't gonna eat you.

371
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:04,960
Not the vines, the lion!

372
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:07,838
Lion?

373
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:10,507
We're gonna die. We're gonna die!

374
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:15,679
Eat him first! Eat him first!

375
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:23,145
Zim Zallah Bim!

376
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:27,357
Be gone, coward! Fear my greatness!

377
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:30,027
You were wonderful, Wizard.

378
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,361
"Wizard"?

379
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,363
You mean the prophecy was true?

380
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,656
Indeed.

381
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:36,950
All right, I've saved the day.

382
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:40,120
It was nothing,
just a little prestidigitatic display.

383
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:42,539
- Shall we to the palace?
- Yes.

384
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:45,334
- Good day, sir.
- Wait, please, sir.

385
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:47,169
My name is Finley.

386
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:50,506
My master's home was ransacked
by the Wicked Witch's baboons.

387
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:53,175
And I've been hiding
in these woods ever since.

388
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:56,386
But now you've saved my life, oh, Wizard.

389
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:59,515
So I hereby swear a life debt to you.

390
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:00,599
No need.

391
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:01,725
From this moment on...

392
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:06,230
I shall be your loyal and faithful servant
until death.

393
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:10,150
Well, he is cute.

394
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,363
All right, you're hired.

395
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:15,447
Wonderful.

396
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:16,740
Let's shake on it.

397
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:18,367
My bag, monkey.

398
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,537
Surely. You must travel light.

399
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:25,374
I got it.

400
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,377
You two run along.

401
00:35:36,552 --> 00:35:38,387
It's the Emerald City.

402
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:41,265
Just down this hill,
along the Yellow Brick Road.

403
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:42,599
Wow.

404
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,394
It'll all be yours now.

405
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:49,022
It's a good thing
green is my favourite colour.

406
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:55,070
You are going to make the best king
Oz has ever known.

407
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:57,072
Thank you.

408
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:59,700
And I will be so proud to be your queen.

409
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,202
My queen?

410
00:36:02,286 --> 00:36:03,954
We'll spend a lifetime together.

411
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:05,873
But right now,
there's thousands of people in Oz...

412
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:09,084
waiting to witness your miracles.

413
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:19,761
Thousands? That's a big show.

414
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:24,600
What now, Wizard?

415
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:28,687
Monkey, tell me again about that life debt.

416
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:30,355
I devote my life to you.

417
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,774
Whatever you wish, whatever you want.

418
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:37,613
It is my sworn duty to deliver for you
until the end of my days.

419
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,031
And there's no getting out of it?

420
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:41,116
None, sir. It is irrevocable.

421
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:43,452
Good. Because I'm not the Wizard.

422
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:51,210
Oh, sir, your sense of humour
is as boundless as it is wondrous.

423
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:52,294
You remind me...

424
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:53,378
Monkey.

425
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:54,922
I'm not the Wizard.

426
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:58,550
You could have told me
before I sealed the life debt.

427
00:36:58,717 --> 00:36:59,760
It's too late.

428
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:01,803
You got to come clean
for that innocent young girl.

429
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,972
I'll deal with her later.

430
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:07,142
As my new assistant, all you
need to know are the three "up"s.

431
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:08,977
Show up, keep up, shut up.

432
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:10,062
But...

433
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:11,146
What's the third "up"?

434
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:17,444
Right. Now, listen,
I'm depending on you.

435
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:19,988
We need to convince
the good people of Oz...

436
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:22,491
that they've found their wizard.

437
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:37,214
Hello, Knuck.

438
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:41,426
Theodora, we've been expecting you.
I shall blow a fanfare.

439
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:45,764
No, no, no. Not now.

440
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:49,393
This is the Wizard.

441
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:50,560
How do you do, sir?

442
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,771
This is the Wizard?

443
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:53,939
Is there a problem?

444
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,235
Yeah.

445
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:06,076
All hail the Wizard.

446
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:07,619
All hail the Wizard.

447
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,706
All hail the Wizard.
The mightiest of mighties.

448
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:12,791
The greatest, most powerful...

449
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:16,545
and most genuine of real and true wizards.

450
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:17,629
Thank you.

451
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:21,049
A wizard above scrutiny
with no covert agenda...

452
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:23,635
or subversive intention whatsoever.

453
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:27,556
A wizard of the highest moral rectitude.

454
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:32,102
He's just a
real, good, solid wizard, everyone.

455
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:34,730
The Wizard, here he is.

456
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,066
How'd I do?

457
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:43,071
Hello? Guys?

458
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,198
Can I get in the carriage?

459
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,784
Can I please get in the carriage?

460
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,923
I shall blow a fanfare.

461
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,091
Not now.

462
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:10,474
Is that it? Is that my throne?

463
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:14,269
Do you like it?

464
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:17,981
I do so hope you like it...

465
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:22,444
because I've been personally
watching over it, awaiting your arrival.

466
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:24,988
Much obliged.

467
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:28,450
Praise be you are here at last...

468
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:31,286
and the prophecy shall be fulfilled.

469
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:35,332
This is a glorious day for us all.

470
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:40,504
And may I add, you're
as handsome a king as we've ever had.

471
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:42,631
Flatterer.

472
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:46,009
Who is this fetching woman?

473
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,595
This is my sister.

474
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:51,973
I am Evanora, the royal advisor.

475
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,811
I have been protecting the Emerald City
whilst we awaited your arrival.

476
00:39:55,977 --> 00:40:00,023
I am here to serve you,
as I served the king before you.

477
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,984
I look forward to being served.

478
00:40:03,527 --> 00:40:05,445
Sister, I like him already.

479
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:09,324
My sceptre.

480
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:12,035
Yes, go on then, have a seat.

481
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:13,495
How does it feel?

482
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:15,831
Fits like a glove.

483
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,834
Goodness. Knuck will show you
to your chambers...

484
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,504
and then we can chat more later.

485
00:40:22,671 --> 00:40:25,382
Can't wait. Monkey, my bag.

486
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:28,802
Yes, Wizard, right away,
oh, great and powerful one.

487
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,057
Thank you, sourpuss.

488
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:36,518
My name is Knuck!

489
00:40:39,563 --> 00:40:42,983
Isn't he wonderful?
Didn't I say he would come?

490
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:47,028
You dare escort that oaf in here...

491
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:49,823
and allow him
to climb on the hallowed throne?

492
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,826
And why not? He is the Wizard.

493
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:55,287
"The Wizard." Or so he says.

494
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:58,540
Did it not occur to you...

495
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:01,668
that he might be an imposter
in league with the Wicked Witch...

496
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:03,211
and sent here to kill us?

497
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,213
The Wicked Witch? Don't be ridiculous.

498
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:09,217
I'm not the one who's
underestimating her cleverness.

499
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,681
Or maybe it's you I'm underestimating.

500
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:19,811
Have you finally joined her side, sister?

501
00:41:20,187 --> 00:41:24,065
I am on no one's side. You know that.

502
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:25,525
I simply want peace.

503
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,736
It's all I ever wanted,
and the Wizard can do that.

504
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:28,904
He's a good man.

505
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,907
What do you know about goodness?
Deep down, you are wicked.

506
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:33,575
I am not wicked!

507
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,917
That temper really is wasted on you.

508
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:46,004
Do you honestly think...

509
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:49,716
that I could conspire against you with her?

510
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:52,594
You are my sister and I love you.

511
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:59,935
All right.

512
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:04,397
But I do need proof
that he is who he claims to be.

513
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:06,691
But he has already proven himself.

514
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,902
Not to me, he hasn't.

515
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:16,451
Thank you for the tour.

516
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:18,203
It's my job.

517
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,412
Giving tours?

518
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,373
Taking care of the king.

519
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,124
Of course. And on that note...

520
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:26,753
I was thinking it might be nice
to have a royal feast.

521
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,879
Maybe a grand roast.

522
00:42:27,963 --> 00:42:32,467
My sister has been telling me
that your magic is really quite powerful.

523
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:33,802
Really?

524
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:38,598
Yes, boggling to the minds
of all who witness it.

525
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:40,141
I do wish I could see it for myself.

526
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:41,309
Yes.

527
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:42,978
Why not show me now?

528
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:45,146
- Now?
- Here.

529
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:48,483
All things in good time.

530
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:51,987
And a good time for all things.

531
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:56,825
So wise. So true.

532
00:42:57,826 --> 00:43:02,163
Well, there is one last room
that I would like you to see.

533
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:05,500
The royal treasure of Oz.

534
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:15,635
It belongs to whoever is king.

535
00:43:20,974 --> 00:43:22,684
It's all right, Wizard.

536
00:43:22,851 --> 00:43:25,353
Go and enjoy your riches.

537
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:34,195
It's mine!

538
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:35,822
Mine!

539
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:39,117
No more second-hand suits for you,
baby!

540
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,703
Nothing but the silks and satins!

541
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:44,289
Ali Baba!

542
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:51,254
And one of these things! What is this?

543
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:52,339
A chalice.

544
00:43:52,422 --> 00:43:54,382
A chalice!

545
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:59,012
I've always wanted a chalice.
And now I've got one.

546
00:43:59,179 --> 00:44:02,098
Well, not quite yet.

547
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:07,520
You see, you only become the king
after you defeat the Wicked Witch.

548
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:09,064
That's the prophecy.

549
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,359
And since you haven't done that yet,
you're not...

550
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:13,568
I'm not actually king.

551
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:14,736
Not yet, no.

552
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:18,156
You still have to
get rid of the Wicked Witch.

553
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:19,824
Right.

554
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:23,578
And killing her won't be easy.

555
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:25,914
No, I don't suppose it will be.

556
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:28,667
Wait a minute.

557
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,710
No one said anything about killing anybody.

558
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:34,756
If you're not interested in being king,
that's all right with me.

559
00:44:34,923 --> 00:44:36,341
We can just forget about the whole thing.

560
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:39,886
The gold and the rubies, the chalice.

561
00:44:40,053 --> 00:44:41,638
I'm interested!

562
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:44,349
I'm just not too keen on killing a lady.

563
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:46,518
She's not a lady.

564
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:49,813
She's a wicked witch.

565
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:53,525
And your magic is the only thing
strong enough to destroy her.

566
00:44:53,692 --> 00:44:57,821
All you have to do is journey to
the Dark Forest and destroy her wand.

567
00:44:57,987 --> 00:44:58,988
- Her wand.
- Yes.

568
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:00,198
It's the source of all her power.

569
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:02,158
Without it, she dies.

570
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:05,078
I haven't even said goodbye
to Theodora. She will be upset.

571
00:45:05,245 --> 00:45:07,956
I will talk to her in the morning.
I will tell her how much you love her...

572
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:09,457
No.

573
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,085
No, don't say anything.

574
00:45:12,252 --> 00:45:16,256
All right. I will say
whatever it is you want me to say...

575
00:45:16,423 --> 00:45:20,593
but are you going to save us all or not?

576
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,314
I'm your wizard.

577
00:45:36,985 --> 00:45:38,695
We're really gonna do this?

578
00:45:38,862 --> 00:45:40,697
How hard could it be
to kill a wicked witch?

579
00:45:40,864 --> 00:45:42,907
Hard. Really hard.

580
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,952
It's very, very hard
to kill a wicked witch.

581
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:50,039
And what about that poor girl
back there? I think she really liked you.

582
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:53,084
She'll get over me. They always do.

583
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:54,252
She's a pretty young witch.

584
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:56,212
There'll be plenty of wizards
knocking at her door.

585
00:45:56,379 --> 00:46:00,091
Every lie you tell gets us one step
closer to the Emerald City dungeon.

586
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:02,135
Then don't think of them as lies.

587
00:46:02,302 --> 00:46:05,430
Think of them as stepping stones
on the road to greatness.

588
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:06,514
Wait, I got it.

589
00:46:06,598 --> 00:46:08,808
We'll turn around and go back.
You'll come clean.

590
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:12,771
You apologise for lying about being the
Wizard and for lying to that poor girl.

591
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:15,440
You gotta really seem contrite.
You gotta sell it.

592
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:16,816
Maybe you could even cry.
Can you cry?

593
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,443
I could cut up an onion.

594
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:19,861
We're not going back.

595
00:46:20,028 --> 00:46:22,781
We're gonna find this wicked witch,
steal her wand...

596
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:24,449
I'll get that big pile of gold...

597
00:46:24,616 --> 00:46:27,494
and you can have
a nice pile of bananas, all right?

598
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,745
Bananas.

599
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:30,497
I see.

600
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:33,124
Because I'm a monkey,
I must love bananas, right?

601
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:35,376
That is a vicious stereotype.

602
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:37,212
- You don't like bananas?
- Of course I love bananas.

603
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,714
I'm a monkey, don't be ridiculous.
I just don't like you saying it.

604
00:46:39,798 --> 00:46:40,799
How about this?

605
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:43,343
We offer to wash all the windows
in the Emerald City...

606
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:44,594
for an entire year.

607
00:46:44,928 --> 00:46:46,429
They'd have to forgive us.

608
00:46:46,596 --> 00:46:48,681
Or we could give them a little help
with their infrastructure.

609
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:51,100
I noticed some yellow brick potholes
back there.

610
00:47:06,783 --> 00:47:08,743
That looks bad.

611
00:47:09,244 --> 00:47:10,411
We're not going down there.

612
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:13,331
Someone might need our help.

613
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:14,499
Not that you care.

614
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:18,586
Get back here! You get back here!

615
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:22,674
We gotta get the Wicked Witch.
What are we doing over here?

616
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,980
What happened here?

617
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:39,667
Hello?

618
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:55,850
Hey, there.

619
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:58,770
Are you all right?

620
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:03,775
Don't worry, we're not gonna hurt you.

621
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:07,278
This is Finley.

622
00:49:07,362 --> 00:49:08,363
Hi.

623
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:09,614
My name is Oz.

624
00:49:11,491 --> 00:49:13,201
Are you...

625
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:15,328
Are you the Wizard?

626
00:49:16,496 --> 00:49:17,830
You've heard of me.

627
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:19,958
Everyone has.

628
00:49:21,209 --> 00:49:23,544
Good. Then you know
there's nothing to be afraid of.

629
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:27,006
So, just come on out of there.

630
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:29,467
But I can't.

631
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:33,346
Oh. All right, hold on.

632
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:39,727
Get this off of you.

633
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:48,236
Oh, no.

634
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:52,532
I'll never get back together.

635
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:05,211
Don't worry. I think I have something.

636
00:50:05,378 --> 00:50:07,046
Give me that bag.

637
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:12,802
I packed something...

638
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:15,263
There it is.

639
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:18,766
- What is that?
- Magic in a bottle.

640
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:20,727
Magic?

641
00:50:21,394 --> 00:50:22,895
Let's give it a try.

642
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:24,772
All right.

643
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:30,611
Just give it a little dab.

644
00:50:31,571 --> 00:50:33,114
Like so.

645
00:50:35,283 --> 00:50:36,909
Okay.

646
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,496
Should work.

647
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:45,126
There we go.

648
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:48,796
Ta-da!

649
00:50:49,464 --> 00:50:51,507
Oh, no, no, no!

650
00:50:54,761 --> 00:50:55,762
They're coming back!

651
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,315
It's okay.

652
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:12,820
They're gone.

653
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,574
The Wicked Witch sent them.

654
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:18,242
Why?

655
00:51:19,869 --> 00:51:21,829
Last night...

656
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:25,917
the whole town
was celebrating out in the streets...

657
00:51:26,084 --> 00:51:28,836
because we had heard
that you finally arrived.

658
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:30,838
Me?

659
00:51:30,922 --> 00:51:33,174
Everyone was so happy.

660
00:51:35,176 --> 00:51:36,677
But then...

661
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:40,890
But then those things flew in.

662
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,601
And then...

663
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:45,019
And then they...

664
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:57,865
Here we go.

665
00:51:58,533 --> 00:52:00,451
Last piece.

666
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:14,215
Would you like to try to stand?

667
00:52:20,555 --> 00:52:21,556
There.

668
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:23,891
All right.

669
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:26,269
There we go.

670
00:52:27,812 --> 00:52:29,397
Easy.

671
00:52:30,565 --> 00:52:31,566
Okay.

672
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,443
I'm gonna let you go.

673
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:38,906
Okay.

674
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,411
Now walk to me.

675
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:46,747
I don't think I can.

676
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:48,416
I think you can.

677
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:51,460
Come on.

678
00:53:10,605 --> 00:53:11,814
All right.

679
00:53:11,981 --> 00:53:13,608
You did it.

680
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:18,696
Thank you.

681
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:34,045
"Dark Forest."

682
00:53:35,463 --> 00:53:37,673
All right, this is it.

683
00:53:38,174 --> 00:53:40,384
Just head on down that way,
about two, three hours.

684
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:42,011
You'll hit the Emerald City.

685
00:53:42,178 --> 00:53:45,348
Tell them I sent you,
they'll take great care of you.

686
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:47,183
Nice meeting you.

687
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:50,228
But...

688
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:53,481
I wanna go with you.

689
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:55,316
What?

690
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,195
On a witch hunt?

691
00:53:59,362 --> 00:54:00,821
No, you're just a little girl.

692
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:03,157
I'm not as delicate as I look!

693
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:04,909
That didn't hurt.

694
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:06,494
I'm coming with you.

695
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:09,372
Listen, we have one rule in show business.

696
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:11,540
Never work with kids or animals.

697
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:13,501
And I'm already working with this thing.

698
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:15,586
Relax.

699
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:17,505
The answer's no.

700
00:54:20,258 --> 00:54:22,176
Oh, no, no, no.

701
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:24,887
Don't do that.

702
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:25,972
You're fine.

703
00:54:26,055 --> 00:54:28,015
You're gonna leave me alone.

704
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:29,350
You're fine.

705
00:54:29,517 --> 00:54:32,186
On a road in the middle of nowhere?

706
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:33,896
All you have to do
is take the Yellow Brick Road.

707
00:54:34,063 --> 00:54:35,356
You'll get there.

708
00:54:36,524 --> 00:54:38,025
It's crying again, what do I do?

709
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:41,737
Oh, no.

710
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:44,031
Off. Come on. Off.

711
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:47,702
- Off of there! Scat!
- Please let me come with you.

712
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:48,869
No! Get off of there!

713
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:51,706
- I promise I won't bother you!
- No dolls on the witch hunt!

714
00:54:56,085 --> 00:54:57,086
Fine.

715
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:59,297
Fine! If you wanna come, come.

716
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:01,215
We'll all go, it'll be a big party.

717
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:05,052
Great. Let's go kill ourselves a witch!

718
00:55:41,297 --> 00:55:44,008
You'll die, you'll die, you'll die!

719
00:55:45,176 --> 00:55:47,928
Did those crows just say
that we were gonna die?

720
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:49,472
They did.

721
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:51,098
Wizard?

722
00:56:01,317 --> 00:56:03,027
Come on.

723
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:16,457
I'm scared.

724
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:22,213
Think there are ghosts out here?

725
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:25,466
No. Of course not.

726
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:28,677
Evil spirits maybe?

727
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:31,138
The undead?

728
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:33,849
The undead?

729
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:36,644
Will you stop that?

730
00:56:50,491 --> 00:56:53,160
No. Get off!

731
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:56,205
Something's got my tail.
Something's got my tail!

732
00:56:56,372 --> 00:56:57,540
Will you calm down?

733
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:04,588
No! What is it?

734
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:06,715
- Look out!
- I wanna go home!

735
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:08,426
I wanna go home!

736
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:10,219
- Hey!
- Hat!

737
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:11,345
Thanks.

738
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:12,680
Look out!

739
00:57:12,847 --> 00:57:14,181
Come on.

740
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:19,520
Hate the Dark Forest.
Hate the Dark Forest.

741
00:57:20,563 --> 00:57:23,357
Oh, my gosh. That was close.

742
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:25,818
Where are we?

743
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:28,737
This must be the place.

744
00:57:30,823 --> 00:57:33,534
So, how are you gonna
kill the Wicked Witch?

745
00:57:33,701 --> 00:57:36,620
All I need to do is get her magic wand.

746
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:39,165
Once I destroy that, she's finished.

747
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:40,541
Why don't you just use this?

748
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:42,543
- It's got a knife!
- Where'd you get that?

749
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:46,547
I'm made of china.
I gotta protect myself somehow.

750
00:57:46,714 --> 00:57:48,048
Give me that.

751
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:49,425
Hey!

752
00:57:49,592 --> 00:57:52,219
- Honestly.
- "Honestly" yourself.

753
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:53,762
Look.

754
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:59,101
That must be her.

755
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:05,566
Come on.

756
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:19,747
She put down the wand.

757
00:58:19,914 --> 00:58:21,999
But how are we gonna get it?

758
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:23,918
Hey!

759
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:26,420
Now, listen up.

760
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:29,131
Here's the plan.

761
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,593
The Wicked Witch is the triangle.

762
00:58:32,927 --> 00:58:36,013
Monkey, you're the X. I'm the O.

763
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,182
China Girl, you're the squiggly line.

764
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:40,935
I wanna be a heart. Can I be a heart?

765
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:43,854
All right, fine. You're a heart.

766
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:46,690
Okay, now, heart stays here...

767
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:50,778
as O makes his way over here.

768
00:58:50,945 --> 00:58:53,447
X counters thusly.

769
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:54,990
Clear so far?

770
00:58:58,869 --> 00:58:59,870
Bless you.

771
00:58:59,954 --> 00:59:02,373
Good work.
You just sneezed away the plan.

772
00:59:02,665 --> 00:59:03,874
- Sorry.
- Never mind.

773
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:05,793
Just go over there
and make some of your animal noises.

774
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,461
I'll grab the wand when she's not looking.

775
00:59:07,628 --> 00:59:09,505
Get out of here.

776
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:21,767
Yes! Come on, come on.

777
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:35,322
Oh, no!

778
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:50,671
Moo!

779
00:59:51,005 --> 00:59:54,174
Moo!

780
00:59:54,383 --> 00:59:56,468
Moo!

781
00:59:56,677 --> 00:59:57,886
A cow?

782
00:59:58,178 --> 01:00:00,681
Moo!

783
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:05,185
Come on. Come on.

784
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:07,021
Hurry!

785
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:08,105
I got it!

786
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:09,315
- Break it.
- Break it, Wizard.

787
01:00:09,481 --> 01:00:10,691
- All right.
- Break it!

788
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:12,026
Did you say "Wizard"?

789
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:15,529
No!

790
01:00:17,031 --> 01:00:18,657
Are you really the Wizard?

791
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:22,453
That's a complicated question.
I mean, what is a wizard?

792
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:34,798
Yes...

793
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,300
I'm the Wizard.

794
01:00:36,467 --> 01:00:38,385
Then there's hope.

795
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:39,845
What's going on?

796
01:00:40,012 --> 01:00:42,806
Not sure. I sneezed the plan away.

797
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:45,392
I have waited so long to meet you.

798
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:48,354
So, we've never met?

799
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,356
Certainly not.

800
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:52,524
I'd remember a thing like that.

801
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:54,318
You've never been to Kansas?

802
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:55,986
What is Kansas?

803
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:58,072
Is that where you're from?

804
01:00:59,073 --> 01:01:02,534
My, you must have travelled very far
to get to the Land of Oz.

805
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:04,328
I did.

806
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:07,748
I'm Glinda the Good.
The Witch of the South.

807
01:01:08,374 --> 01:01:10,542
I thought Evanora was the Good Witch.

808
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:13,087
Evanora is the true Wicked Witch.

809
01:01:13,379 --> 01:01:15,673
Conniving and as cruel as they come.

810
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,925
She's fooled most everyone,
including her own sister.

811
01:01:18,092 --> 01:01:21,220
She made everyone believe
that I poisoned my father...

812
01:01:21,387 --> 01:01:22,388
but it was her.

813
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:23,555
Then...

814
01:01:23,681 --> 01:01:26,350
she's the one who destroyed my village?

815
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:34,692
I'm so sorry, child.

816
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:41,699
Here's your wand.

817
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:44,076
Sorry I mooed.

818
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:48,414
And to think, you almost
killed Glinda for a bit of gold.

819
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:49,581
A bit?

820
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:51,917
There were mountains of it, buddy.

821
01:01:52,084 --> 01:01:54,128
Not that I was going to do it.

822
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:56,797
I wasn't really going to break your wand.

823
01:01:58,382 --> 01:01:59,925
Follow me.

824
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:05,055
Okay.

825
01:02:07,141 --> 01:02:08,350
No.

826
01:02:08,517 --> 01:02:11,770
No, no, no. It cannot be.

827
01:02:12,146 --> 01:02:13,522
Curse you, Glinda.

828
01:02:13,689 --> 01:02:15,983
You should be dead.
I'll see you dead yet.

829
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:18,694
Curse you and your pretty little face.

830
01:02:18,861 --> 01:02:20,070
Sister.

831
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:24,533
Sister, the Wizard is missing.
I've looked everywhere, but he's gone.

832
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:27,161
What is it?

833
01:02:27,786 --> 01:02:29,496
Where is the Wizard?

834
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:31,123
Where's the Wizard?

835
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:33,250
With Glinda.

836
01:02:36,712 --> 01:02:37,921
Then it's happening.

837
01:02:40,466 --> 01:02:42,885
Sister, he's fulfilling the prophecy.

838
01:02:43,552 --> 01:02:46,847
He'll bring her darkness to the light
and peace to the land.

839
01:02:47,014 --> 01:02:52,102
Yes, I'm certain
that's what is happening. It must be.

840
01:03:06,158 --> 01:03:07,159
Where did you get that?

841
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:10,037
This?

842
01:03:12,915 --> 01:03:15,751
It was a gift. From him.

843
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:22,591
He came to my chambers last night.

844
01:03:22,758 --> 01:03:25,677
Oh, how we danced.

845
01:03:25,844 --> 01:03:27,846
For hours, it seemed.

846
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:33,060
I can still feel his body
pressed against mine.

847
01:03:34,603 --> 01:03:37,648
Sister, you were right about him.
He is the great Wizard.

848
01:03:37,815 --> 01:03:42,945
He must be, to make me feel the way I feel.

849
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:54,122
Oh, no.

850
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:56,875
Not you, too, sister?

851
01:03:57,042 --> 01:04:00,212
He said we would rule Oz together.

852
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:03,257
He said I would be his queen.

853
01:04:03,423 --> 01:04:04,633
Did he?

854
01:04:14,977 --> 01:04:18,730
Are you quite sure
it wasn't you who said it to him?

855
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:42,671
You fool!

856
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:05,485
Serves you right.

857
01:05:06,278 --> 01:05:09,823
I want Glinda and that wizard
torn to shreds.

858
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:13,952
Do not fail me a second time.

859
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:17,164
Fly!

860
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:37,809
On the day my father died,
we lost a kind and noble leader.

861
01:05:37,976 --> 01:05:41,605
And a dark shadow
was cast across this land.

862
01:05:41,772 --> 01:05:45,609
I've had to stand alone against Evanora
and watch...

863
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:49,696
as towns were destroyed,
children were orphaned...

864
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:52,282
and my heart was broken.

865
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:57,496
I've been unable to protect
the good people of Oz by myself.

866
01:05:58,956 --> 01:06:03,043
With only faith in my father's prophecy,
I've waited.

867
01:06:03,794 --> 01:06:04,795
For you...

868
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:11,551
great Wizard from Kansas,
to come and set things right.

869
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:16,139
So, that's the prophecy.

870
01:06:21,353 --> 01:06:24,189
You see, when I agreed to be king...

871
01:06:24,356 --> 01:06:26,692
I didn't realise
how complicated all of this was.

872
01:06:26,858 --> 01:06:28,652
She knows.

873
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:30,612
What?

874
01:06:30,696 --> 01:06:33,657
Evanora knows you know the truth now.
Look.

875
01:06:33,865 --> 01:06:34,908
Oh, no.

876
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:45,711
What do we do?

877
01:06:45,877 --> 01:06:47,087
Wizard, now is the time.

878
01:06:47,254 --> 01:06:48,255
The time?

879
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:49,756
Use your magic.

880
01:06:51,717 --> 01:06:54,553
My magic. Yes.

881
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:00,767
I think we should run.

882
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:02,686
Run?

883
01:07:02,853 --> 01:07:04,438
Yeah.

884
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:06,732
You heard the Wizard. Run!

885
01:07:06,898 --> 01:07:08,900
- Let's get out of here!
- Let's go!

886
01:07:14,031 --> 01:07:15,615
They're gaining on us!

887
01:07:15,866 --> 01:07:17,284
What are you doing?

888
01:07:17,868 --> 01:07:19,119
Is that gonna stop them?

889
01:07:19,286 --> 01:07:20,871
I don't know.

890
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:33,467
Nice work. We lost them.

891
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:34,718
That was close.

892
01:07:34,885 --> 01:07:36,136
Yeah.

893
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:40,265
Wait, I hear something.

894
01:07:49,316 --> 01:07:50,567
They're getting closer!

895
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:56,907
Wait for me!

896
01:08:01,161 --> 01:08:02,954
Look out!

897
01:08:15,175 --> 01:08:16,676
Monkey!

898
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:19,513
Little China Girl!

899
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:22,849
Wizard! I'm over here!

900
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:27,354
- Help! Catch me, please!
- Got you!

901
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:30,690
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

902
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:32,442
I'm okay, too.

903
01:08:33,985 --> 01:08:34,986
Just go!

904
01:08:35,112 --> 01:08:36,696
Great! A bunch of fog.

905
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:39,282
This is her big idea on how to save us?

906
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:42,369
It was the best I could do
under the circumstances.

907
01:08:50,127 --> 01:08:51,128
Okay.

908
01:08:53,547 --> 01:08:54,548
Catch her!

909
01:08:55,215 --> 01:08:57,175
Get me! Don't let go!

910
01:08:57,384 --> 01:08:58,885
Monkey, grab her!

911
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:00,220
Don't let go! Don't let go!

912
01:09:00,387 --> 01:09:02,180
Pull my tail.

913
01:09:02,347 --> 01:09:04,266
Not so hard.

914
01:09:05,559 --> 01:09:07,060
They're getting closer!

915
01:09:08,228 --> 01:09:09,354
What do we do?

916
01:09:09,521 --> 01:09:10,689
What do we do?

917
01:09:10,856 --> 01:09:12,941
Just do what I do.

918
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:16,444
Unless you've got something.

919
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:19,197
No, you go.

920
01:09:22,617 --> 01:09:24,452
Wait. What are you doing?

921
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:27,706
Wanda!

922
01:09:28,039 --> 01:09:29,040
Where are you going?

923
01:09:29,124 --> 01:09:30,750
She said to do what she did.

924
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:33,461
Just because she jumped off the cliff,
you're gonna jump off the cliff?

925
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:35,547
I have wings.

926
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:38,091
- What about me?
- Come on!

927
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:10,790
Whee!

928
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:34,940
Wow.

929
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:03,551
These things go kind of fast, huh?

930
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:13,853
Hey, is that a wall?

931
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:15,105
Of sorts.

932
01:11:15,272 --> 01:11:17,774
It repels our enemies
and protects us from harm.

933
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:20,527
But we're headed straight for it.

934
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:22,696
Yes, we are.

935
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:27,617
And going very fast.
How do you...

936
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:30,787
Does this thing have any brakes?

937
01:11:31,746 --> 01:11:34,582
I'm going too fast! I'm gonna die!

938
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:36,584
You needn't worry, Wizard.

939
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:38,378
It's a magic wall.

940
01:11:38,545 --> 01:11:41,548
And all good-hearted souls
get to pass through.

941
01:11:42,549 --> 01:11:43,883
I'm gonna die!

942
01:11:46,136 --> 01:11:48,305
Wanda!

943
01:12:05,405 --> 01:12:07,782
It's beautiful.

944
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:26,217
They've waited a long time for you, Wizard.

945
01:12:43,193 --> 01:12:45,695
All hail the great and powerful Oz!

946
01:12:45,862 --> 01:12:47,614
Hail!

947
01:12:48,782 --> 01:12:49,824
Thank you!

948
01:12:49,991 --> 01:12:51,743
Wow, you're a wonderful crowd.

949
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:55,705
You put the "merry" back in
"the merry Land of Oz."

950
01:12:59,959 --> 01:13:01,586
Hi, what's your name?

951
01:13:01,753 --> 01:13:02,754
You're very beautiful.

952
01:13:02,921 --> 01:13:03,922
Thank you.

953
01:13:04,089 --> 01:13:07,467
Girls, listen, I am not a toy.
I am not a toy!

954
01:13:07,634 --> 01:13:09,386
Oz! Oz!

955
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:10,553
Hello!

956
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:13,056
What? No fireworks?

957
01:13:13,223 --> 01:13:15,350
What are fireworks?

958
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:17,143
Remind me to show you sometime.

959
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:21,147
Glinda, I didn't know
if you'd like these, or these.

960
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:24,109
They're both so beautiful,
I couldn't possibly decide.

961
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:26,027
We need your help, Wizard.

962
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:28,071
Please save us!

963
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:30,615
You know, I should tell you...

964
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:35,745
I might not actually be a wizard.

965
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:37,414
Yes, I know.

966
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:38,581
Oh.

967
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:41,292
At least, not any kind of wizard
we were expecting.

968
01:13:41,876 --> 01:13:43,128
You could tell?

969
01:13:43,294 --> 01:13:44,629
Yes.

970
01:13:44,796 --> 01:13:47,674
I can also tell you're weak, selfish...

971
01:13:47,841 --> 01:13:50,969
slightly egotistical and a fibber.

972
01:13:51,136 --> 01:13:54,305
I see.
Anything you don't know about me?

973
01:13:54,472 --> 01:13:56,933
Whether or not you'll save my people.

974
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:59,686
No. I just told you I'm not the Wizard.

975
01:13:59,853 --> 01:14:02,021
But they don't know that.

976
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:06,943
If you can make them believe,
then you're wizard enough.

977
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:11,072
These are desperate times, after all.

978
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:15,076
Can you make them believe?

979
01:14:20,748 --> 01:14:24,544
Will I still get that gold?

980
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:32,719
Good people of Oz.

981
01:14:33,178 --> 01:14:36,222
Your Wizard is here!

982
01:14:57,452 --> 01:14:59,704
What's the matter, sister?

983
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:03,750
Look at how happy they are.

984
01:15:03,917 --> 01:15:05,752
Do you think she'll be his queen?

985
01:15:05,919 --> 01:15:07,962
Of course she'll be his queen.

986
01:15:08,338 --> 01:15:10,131
What did you expect?

987
01:15:10,298 --> 01:15:12,217
You can't compete with Glinda's charms.

988
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:13,760
No one can.

989
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:19,265
Oh, God. Sister, it hurts.

990
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:21,434
Such is a broken heart.

991
01:15:21,601 --> 01:15:24,187
Your precious wizard did that to you.

992
01:15:24,979 --> 01:15:26,856
Make it stop.

993
01:15:27,982 --> 01:15:29,692
Would you like me to?

994
01:15:40,662 --> 01:15:43,998
One bite is all it takes.

995
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:48,545
One bite and your world
will change forever.

996
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:54,133
One bite and your heart
will become impenetrable.

997
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:58,304
One bite and you and I
will finally share the throne.

998
01:15:58,638 --> 01:16:00,640
Unless you'd rather see
Oz and Glinda there.

999
01:16:21,661 --> 01:16:24,497
You're the wicked one. Not Glinda.

1000
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:28,334
Sister, you lied to me.

1001
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:30,878
It's nice, isn't it?

1002
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:33,715
How clear everything becomes.

1003
01:16:45,852 --> 01:16:48,271
What is happening to me?

1004
01:16:48,438 --> 01:16:50,440
It's just your heart withering away.

1005
01:16:51,566 --> 01:16:52,859
Fear not, Theodora...

1006
01:16:53,026 --> 01:16:57,196
for soon you will feel
nothing at all except...

1007
01:16:57,363 --> 01:17:00,867
beautiful wickedness.

1008
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:20,595
Sister?

1009
01:17:41,741 --> 01:17:44,077
Sister, you're hideous.

1010
01:17:45,745 --> 01:17:47,121
I can cast a simple enchantment...

1011
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:49,415
and have you looking
just the way you were before.

1012
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:50,667
No.

1013
01:17:51,084 --> 01:17:53,419
This is who I am now.

1014
01:17:56,214 --> 01:17:58,466
I want him to see me like this.

1015
01:17:59,092 --> 01:18:02,929
I want him to know that he was the one
who made me this way.

1016
01:18:05,556 --> 01:18:07,433
Oh, dear.

1017
01:18:20,488 --> 01:18:23,700
It's imperative that you behave like
the great leader that they think you are.

1018
01:18:23,866 --> 01:18:27,453
Morale is essential if we have
any hope of defeating Evanora.

1019
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:28,955
And I assume you have a plan.

1020
01:18:29,122 --> 01:18:30,123
No.

1021
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:32,792
You have a plan.

1022
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:35,962
You're going to lead us into battle
and take back the throne.

1023
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:40,550
And do we have an army to help do this?

1024
01:18:42,176 --> 01:18:43,302
Of sorts.

1025
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:47,140
The Quadlings, Your Highness.

1026
01:18:49,183 --> 01:18:50,685
You're soldiers?

1027
01:18:50,852 --> 01:18:54,313
No, sir. Farmers, mostly.

1028
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,481
Farmers?

1029
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:57,734
But you can fight.

1030
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,986
No, sir. Many of us can hoe.

1031
01:19:00,153 --> 01:19:01,362
Oh, you can hoe.

1032
01:19:01,529 --> 01:19:03,406
- And I can work with iron.
- That's good.

1033
01:19:03,573 --> 01:19:04,991
- I bake bread.
- Yummy.

1034
01:19:05,158 --> 01:19:06,993
- I can sew.
- Not so helpful.

1035
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,369
I can make a scarecrow.

1036
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:12,498
That'll come in handy.

1037
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:14,333
It might.

1038
01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:17,754
And these are the Tinkers.

1039
01:19:19,005 --> 01:19:20,256
Are you kidding me?

1040
01:19:20,423 --> 01:19:23,009
We're tougher than we look, Wizard.

1041
01:19:25,178 --> 01:19:27,430
What they lack in stamina,
the Tinkers make up for in ingenuity.

1042
01:19:27,597 --> 01:19:29,557
They can build anything.

1043
01:19:31,517 --> 01:19:33,352
And I'll tell you what else.

1044
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:35,521
We can build anything.

1045
01:19:35,772 --> 01:19:36,856
Yeah, I got it.

1046
01:19:37,023 --> 01:19:41,360
And we're prepared
to storm the Emerald City.

1047
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:43,863
If you don't keel over on the way there.

1048
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:49,786
And, finally, the Munchkins.

1049
01:20:01,839 --> 01:20:03,758
Please tell me you gentlemen can fight.

1050
01:20:03,925 --> 01:20:04,926
No.

1051
01:20:05,009 --> 01:20:06,636
But we make pretty clothes.

1052
01:20:06,803 --> 01:20:08,346
Also, we sing.

1053
01:20:08,763 --> 01:20:10,348
No, that won't be necessary.

1054
01:20:10,515 --> 01:20:13,601
I like it, I think it's cute.
I hope you like it.

1055
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:19,774
<i>The prophecy was clear
The wind would bring you here</i>

1056
01:20:19,941 --> 01:20:21,734
<i>And so it was A man named Oz</i>

1057
01:20:21,901 --> 01:20:24,111
<i>Would magically appear</i>

1058
01:20:24,278 --> 01:20:25,279
All right, enough.

1059
01:20:25,446 --> 01:20:28,741
<i>So, sound the battle call
The Wicked Witch will fall</i>

1060
01:20:28,908 --> 01:20:31,911
<i>And so it is the wondrous Wiz
Will come to save us all</i>

1061
01:20:32,078 --> 01:20:33,079
All right, that's enough!

1062
01:20:33,246 --> 01:20:34,622
Munchkins, stop!

1063
01:20:39,627 --> 01:20:40,920
They do make beautiful clothes.

1064
01:20:41,087 --> 01:20:42,129
All right.

1065
01:20:42,296 --> 01:20:44,590
Now, listen, Wanda.

1066
01:20:44,757 --> 01:20:46,217
Glinda.

1067
01:20:47,635 --> 01:20:49,929
Guys, take five.

1068
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:57,895
Glinda, these are all very lovely people.

1069
01:20:58,396 --> 01:20:59,814
But do you honestly believe...

1070
01:20:59,981 --> 01:21:03,860
that they can kill a wicked witch
and an army of flying baboons?

1071
01:21:04,777 --> 01:21:07,154
I don't expect them to kill anyone.

1072
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:08,239
What do you mean?

1073
01:21:08,322 --> 01:21:10,825
I mean the good people of Oz
are forbidden to kill.

1074
01:21:10,992 --> 01:21:12,785
Forbidden to...

1075
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:21,002
You want me to lead
an army that can't kill?

1076
01:21:21,794 --> 01:21:24,881
If this was easy,
we wouldn't need a wizard, would we?

1077
01:21:25,756 --> 01:21:27,675
Something's wrong!

1078
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:29,802
- Look!
- What is that?

1079
01:21:29,969 --> 01:21:32,889
- The wall!
- What's happening?

1080
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:35,141
The Wicked Witch isn't powerful
enough to get through the wall.

1081
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:38,394
It looks like she's managing.

1082
01:21:38,895 --> 01:21:41,355
Not by herself, she isn't.

1083
01:21:41,522 --> 01:21:42,899
What does that mean?
Is someone helping her?

1084
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:44,317
Everyone, take cover!

1085
01:21:44,483 --> 01:21:46,485
Run quickly! Take cover!

1086
01:21:47,945 --> 01:21:49,030
Get the children to safety!

1087
01:21:49,196 --> 01:21:50,448
Run!

1088
01:21:51,324 --> 01:21:52,325
Glinda!

1089
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:52,218
There's so much good here.

1090
01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:55,471
It sickens me.

1091
01:22:59,642 --> 01:23:03,813
Still think your Wizard can save you
from the likes of me?

1092
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:11,070
Speak up, or I will tear out your tongue!

1093
01:23:11,237 --> 01:23:12,655
Now, who is that?

1094
01:23:13,906 --> 01:23:16,575
Don't you recognise me, Wizard?

1095
01:23:17,785 --> 01:23:19,495
Have I changed so much?

1096
01:23:20,663 --> 01:23:21,664
Theodora?

1097
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:24,917
May I have this dance?

1098
01:23:28,462 --> 01:23:29,755
Hey, hey!

1099
01:23:32,091 --> 01:23:34,260
I get it! You're a little upset!

1100
01:23:40,266 --> 01:23:43,477
Theodora, stop. You're hurting him.

1101
01:23:57,158 --> 01:24:00,119
Theodora, what happened to you?

1102
01:24:00,286 --> 01:24:01,704
You happened to me.

1103
01:24:08,461 --> 01:24:09,837
This isn't you.

1104
01:24:10,504 --> 01:24:13,883
It's your sister.
She's worked her magic on you.

1105
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:16,302
I'd hoped you'd be able to see through her.

1106
01:24:17,011 --> 01:24:19,555
Glinda, so naive.

1107
01:24:20,306 --> 01:24:23,350
Just like your father.

1108
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:27,313
That's why it was so easy
for my sister to kill him.

1109
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:32,985
She only killed a man,
not what he believed in.

1110
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:35,738
Begone, Witch,
before the Wizard makes mush of you!

1111
01:24:40,910 --> 01:24:42,995
How sweet.

1112
01:24:44,872 --> 01:24:46,832
You all believe in him.

1113
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:50,753
Well, so did I, once.

1114
01:24:52,505 --> 01:24:54,965
And as for you...

1115
01:24:55,132 --> 01:24:58,803
my pretty one.

1116
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:02,515
When I return with
my sister and her army...

1117
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:04,809
the Yellow Brick Road
will be red with the blood...

1118
01:25:04,975 --> 01:25:10,064
of every Tinker, farmer and Munchkin
in your kingdom.

1119
01:25:10,689 --> 01:25:13,025
You underestimate us, Theodora.

1120
01:25:14,819 --> 01:25:18,823
We are a strong and united people.

1121
01:25:18,989 --> 01:25:22,034
And now the Wizard is here to lead us.

1122
01:25:22,743 --> 01:25:25,538
And as for your Wizard...

1123
01:25:25,830 --> 01:25:29,208
he will be the first to die.

1124
01:25:29,375 --> 01:25:33,546
And you will all see
that he is nothing but a deceitful...

1125
01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:38,884
selfish and extremely mortal man.

1126
01:25:40,052 --> 01:25:42,096
Give me that!

1127
01:25:43,889 --> 01:25:46,058
It was a broom that you wanted.

1128
01:25:47,017 --> 01:25:48,602
Wasn't it, Wizard?

1129
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:03,117
It's all right.

1130
01:26:04,743 --> 01:26:05,870
It's all right!

1131
01:26:06,537 --> 01:26:09,748
She's gone now. Don't be frightened.

1132
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:11,917
Now that the Wizard is with us...

1133
01:26:12,543 --> 01:26:13,919
Wizard?

1134
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:19,133
Leaving?

1135
01:26:19,592 --> 01:26:20,759
But you promised to help us.

1136
01:26:20,926 --> 01:26:23,554
Yeah, well, that was
before I knew what we were up against.

1137
01:26:23,721 --> 01:26:25,806
An army and yet another wicked witch?

1138
01:26:25,973 --> 01:26:29,059
This one bent on destroying everyone,
especially me?

1139
01:26:29,226 --> 01:26:30,561
We can defeat them.

1140
01:26:30,728 --> 01:26:32,479
There must be something.

1141
01:26:32,646 --> 01:26:35,274
Something we haven't thought of.
Something that we're not seeing.

1142
01:26:35,441 --> 01:26:36,609
Something we're just on the verge of.

1143
01:26:36,775 --> 01:26:38,277
Glinda.

1144
01:26:38,444 --> 01:26:41,113
You need a real wizard.
Better yet, a general.

1145
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:43,157
But you're all I have.

1146
01:26:46,619 --> 01:26:49,288
So, you're not the wizard I was expecting.

1147
01:26:50,247 --> 01:26:52,583
So, you don't have the powers
I thought you'd have.

1148
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:55,961
But you're here.

1149
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:58,672
There must be a reason.

1150
01:26:58,839 --> 01:27:02,801
Maybe you're capable of more than you know.

1151
01:27:05,638 --> 01:27:08,766
Glinda, I wish I had the answer.

1152
01:27:09,642 --> 01:27:11,810
But I'm just a con man.

1153
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:14,772
I'm a carnival magician.

1154
01:27:17,274 --> 01:27:20,486
I'm just not the man you want me to be.

1155
01:27:22,321 --> 01:27:24,990
Someone needs to tuck me in.

1156
01:27:30,204 --> 01:27:31,872
Yes, of course.

1157
01:27:34,667 --> 01:27:36,126
Allow me.

1158
01:27:36,961 --> 01:27:38,879
My papa used to do it.

1159
01:27:42,967 --> 01:27:44,385
I see.

1160
01:27:44,969 --> 01:27:47,846
Perhaps you'd prefer the Wizard, then?

1161
01:27:48,889 --> 01:27:51,016
Yes, please.

1162
01:28:07,241 --> 01:28:08,617
All right.

1163
01:28:08,951 --> 01:28:11,036
In you go.

1164
01:28:12,329 --> 01:28:13,330
Here you are.

1165
01:28:14,164 --> 01:28:15,499
Just a moment.

1166
01:28:18,419 --> 01:28:20,421
Bring forth the covers now.

1167
01:28:20,587 --> 01:28:21,922
Yes, ma'am.

1168
01:28:24,925 --> 01:28:26,427
Comfy?

1169
01:28:28,262 --> 01:28:29,430
Goodnight.

1170
01:28:29,596 --> 01:28:31,223
Do you grant wishes?

1171
01:28:32,599 --> 01:28:33,684
Do I what?

1172
01:28:33,851 --> 01:28:35,394
Grant wishes.

1173
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:37,938
The old wizard could grant wishes.

1174
01:28:39,606 --> 01:28:44,403
People would travel to the Emerald City
and ask him for things.

1175
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:48,032
And if they were good and noble wishes...

1176
01:28:48,198 --> 01:28:49,408
he would grant them.

1177
01:28:49,575 --> 01:28:51,243
Is that right?

1178
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:54,038
Do you know what I'd wish for?

1179
01:28:54,747 --> 01:28:56,081
A pretty dress?

1180
01:28:57,458 --> 01:28:59,585
To have my family back.

1181
01:29:01,962 --> 01:29:03,797
I know.

1182
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:05,382
I'm sorry.

1183
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:08,260
I can't grant wishes.

1184
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:11,138
I'm not that kind of wizard.

1185
01:29:12,806 --> 01:29:14,808
That's what I thought.

1186
01:29:16,602 --> 01:29:20,939
You see, where I come from,
there aren't any real wizards.

1187
01:29:22,274 --> 01:29:25,402
Although, there is one.

1188
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:29,990
Thomas Alva Edison.

1189
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:34,495
The Wizard of Menlo Park.
A truly great man.

1190
01:29:34,661 --> 01:29:36,246
Did he grant wishes?

1191
01:29:36,413 --> 01:29:37,790
No.

1192
01:29:37,956 --> 01:29:41,627
But he could look into the future
and make it real.

1193
01:29:41,794 --> 01:29:45,339
He created the electric light,
the phonograph.

1194
01:29:45,506 --> 01:29:49,134
He created a camera
that could take moving pictures.

1195
01:29:49,301 --> 01:29:50,677
Pictures that move?

1196
01:29:50,844 --> 01:29:52,638
Yeah. Can you imagine?

1197
01:29:52,805 --> 01:29:56,350
And all he had was a little bit of wire
and some glass.

1198
01:29:56,975 --> 01:30:01,271
With almost nothing,
he made the impossible real.

1199
01:30:01,438 --> 01:30:03,524
Is that the kind of wizard you are?

1200
01:30:08,779 --> 01:30:11,824
It's the kind of wizard I'd like to be.

1201
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:15,661
You are that kind. I can tell.

1202
01:30:16,995 --> 01:30:22,042
I'd rather you grant wishes,
but that's a good wizard, too.

1203
01:30:24,211 --> 01:30:26,380
Goodnight, Wizard.

1204
01:30:33,387 --> 01:30:35,848
Glinda. I've got it.

1205
01:30:36,473 --> 01:30:37,433
What have you got?

1206
01:30:37,516 --> 01:30:39,685
I've got a way out of this mess.

1207
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:45,691
- What is this?
- A battle plan.

1208
01:30:49,695 --> 01:30:51,196
It's all in there.

1209
01:30:51,363 --> 01:30:54,199
Illusion, misdirect, sleight of hand.

1210
01:30:54,992 --> 01:30:56,034
Look...

1211
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:59,830
I know I'm not the wizard
that you were expecting...

1212
01:30:59,997 --> 01:31:02,374
but I might just be
the wizard that you need.

1213
01:31:06,587 --> 01:31:08,422
You said you were just a con man.

1214
01:31:08,839 --> 01:31:09,882
Precisely.

1215
01:31:10,048 --> 01:31:11,216
Nothing but a trickster?

1216
01:31:11,383 --> 01:31:12,384
Yes.

1217
01:31:12,551 --> 01:31:14,011
A terrible cheat?

1218
01:31:14,178 --> 01:31:15,512
The best there is.

1219
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:18,891
The carnival magician's
going to put on a show.

1220
01:31:19,057 --> 01:31:21,768
I'll put on the show of a lifetime.

1221
01:31:21,935 --> 01:31:25,230
The likes of which
the Land of Oz has never seen!

1222
01:31:26,273 --> 01:31:30,736
Magic, mystery, prestidigitation!

1223
01:31:32,404 --> 01:31:35,324
It'll be my greatest trick yet.

1224
01:31:36,909 --> 01:31:38,827
Tinkers, gather around!

1225
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:40,579
Quickly, now.

1226
01:31:40,746 --> 01:31:42,581
This is what you're gonna build.

1227
01:31:42,748 --> 01:31:46,084
Where I come from,
this is called a praxinoscope.

1228
01:31:46,251 --> 01:31:48,086
Although, I've made a few modifications.

1229
01:31:48,253 --> 01:31:51,215
It allows you to project
an image into space.

1230
01:31:51,381 --> 01:31:52,925
Impossible.

1231
01:31:53,091 --> 01:31:56,428
Nothing's impossible
if you put your mind to it.

1232
01:31:56,595 --> 01:31:58,013
- Bully.
- Bully!

1233
01:31:58,430 --> 01:32:00,933
These three roads
all lead to the Emerald City.

1234
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:04,603
To the east are the deadly poppy fields.
We'll have to steer clear of them.

1235
01:32:04,686 --> 01:32:05,687
Why is that?

1236
01:32:05,771 --> 01:32:07,606
One good whiff and it's everlasting sleep.

1237
01:32:07,773 --> 01:32:11,443
And we're not exactly
a terrifying army when we're awake.

1238
01:32:11,610 --> 01:32:13,904
All right. We'll steer clear.

1239
01:32:14,947 --> 01:32:16,782
Or maybe not.

1240
01:32:16,949 --> 01:32:19,576
In the conjuring business,
flash is always good.

1241
01:32:19,743 --> 01:32:21,453
Gives the audience a little "wow".

1242
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:25,749
You gentlemen will be combining
sulphur rock, nitrate of pot ash...

1243
01:32:26,416 --> 01:32:29,127
and charcoal to create
what is commonly known...

1244
01:32:29,294 --> 01:32:30,295
as black powder.

1245
01:32:32,548 --> 01:32:36,593
Mr Quimby, we need 200 bales of hay
delivered to the main road by noon.

1246
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:39,721
Mr zim, have the Quadling carts...

1247
01:32:51,233 --> 01:32:52,484
Looks good.

1248
01:33:28,312 --> 01:33:30,814
My very own Winkie Guards...

1249
01:33:30,981 --> 01:33:35,527
soon you will be facing Glinda
and her army of weaklings.

1250
01:33:35,694 --> 01:33:38,905
And when they see our towering might...

1251
01:33:39,072 --> 01:33:41,116
they will run and flee for the hills and...

1252
01:33:41,283 --> 01:33:42,451
No!

1253
01:33:42,618 --> 01:33:44,953
We shall not let them flee!

1254
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,539
We shall show them no mercy!

1255
01:33:54,463 --> 01:33:56,632
Now, I've added this adjustable lens
to your design...

1256
01:33:56,798 --> 01:33:58,717
along with a few other things.

1257
01:33:58,884 --> 01:34:00,135
Have a look.

1258
01:34:02,971 --> 01:34:06,808
Yes! Edison himself would be proud.

1259
01:34:09,895 --> 01:34:13,106
Now, there's something else
I need you to do.

1260
01:34:13,273 --> 01:34:16,068
But I'd rather you just keep it between us.

1261
01:34:16,234 --> 01:34:17,486
Yes?

1262
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:21,156
Do you know how to build a hot air balloon?

1263
01:34:30,624 --> 01:34:32,000
This is all very impressive...

1264
01:34:32,167 --> 01:34:33,919
but you still haven't told me how you plan

1265
01:34:34,002 --> 01:34:35,545
to get this thing into the Emerald City.

1266
01:34:35,712 --> 01:34:37,714
Relax. I know someone.

1267
01:34:37,881 --> 01:34:39,549
What do you mean you know someone?

1268
01:34:39,716 --> 01:34:40,967
Hello, Wizard.

1269
01:34:41,134 --> 01:34:45,555
Well, well, well.
If it isn't old Sourpuss.

1270
01:34:45,806 --> 01:34:47,182
My name is Knuck!

1271
01:34:47,349 --> 01:34:48,684
Now, you two be nice to each other.

1272
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:50,560
- Let's move it, Wizard.
- Can you give me a break?

1273
01:34:50,727 --> 01:34:52,145
I'll break your nose!

1274
01:34:53,021 --> 01:34:55,774
Guess I'm up.
Time to do what I do, right?

1275
01:34:55,899 --> 01:34:56,858
Cue the con man.

1276
01:34:56,942 --> 01:35:00,195
Would you stop?
A con man couldn't have done all this.

1277
01:35:00,362 --> 01:35:02,322
You're much more than that.

1278
01:35:02,948 --> 01:35:05,492
Well, then, it looks like
I've got you fooled, too.

1279
01:35:05,951 --> 01:35:08,954
The only person you've got fooled
is yourself.

1280
01:35:31,810 --> 01:35:33,729
For protection.

1281
01:35:34,896 --> 01:35:35,897
Not that you need it.

1282
01:35:48,827 --> 01:35:51,079
Great people of Oz.

1283
01:35:51,246 --> 01:35:56,251
Today we fight to free the land
from the villainy of the Wicked Witches.

1284
01:35:57,544 --> 01:35:59,337
We are few...

1285
01:35:59,504 --> 01:36:00,756
but we are mighty!

1286
01:36:01,965 --> 01:36:03,425
Quadlings.

1287
01:36:03,633 --> 01:36:05,260
- Tinkers.
- Bully!

1288
01:36:05,427 --> 01:36:07,137
Munchkins.

1289
01:36:07,637 --> 01:36:12,184
We face great odds,
but we are armed with our courage...

1290
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:14,978
our hard work and most of all...

1291
01:36:15,604 --> 01:36:18,231
our faith in one another.

1292
01:36:18,774 --> 01:36:23,361
We have nothing to fear
as long as we believe.

1293
01:36:23,862 --> 01:36:25,739
For when we do believe...

1294
01:36:26,198 --> 01:36:28,033
anything is possible!

1295
01:36:30,327 --> 01:36:31,912
Onward!

1296
01:36:57,604 --> 01:36:58,605
Halt!

1297
01:37:00,607 --> 01:37:02,234
Good day there, fellow Winkie guardsman.

1298
01:37:02,484 --> 01:37:03,485
What is your business here?

1299
01:37:03,652 --> 01:37:04,903
Supplies for battle.

1300
01:37:05,278 --> 01:37:07,614
We bring supplies for battle.

1301
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:11,785
I was told of no such delivery.

1302
01:37:12,661 --> 01:37:13,954
Where are your papers of transit?

1303
01:37:15,413 --> 01:37:18,124
Why this delay?
Do you not recognise me?

1304
01:37:18,291 --> 01:37:19,584
I'm Knuck, the City Herald.

1305
01:37:19,751 --> 01:37:21,002
Sir, I'm just trying to do my...

1306
01:37:23,296 --> 01:37:24,798
What I meant was...

1307
01:37:26,007 --> 01:37:27,008
Let them pass!

1308
01:37:27,133 --> 01:37:29,302
Let them pass.

1309
01:38:27,694 --> 01:38:29,487
What's this?

1310
01:38:42,834 --> 01:38:45,545
They dare march on us?

1311
01:38:46,504 --> 01:38:48,590
- Tear them apart!
- Fly!

1312
01:39:38,974 --> 01:39:40,058
It's a trick.

1313
01:39:40,225 --> 01:39:41,267
Pull!

1314
01:39:48,775 --> 01:39:51,236
Retreat! Retreat!

1315
01:40:06,668 --> 01:40:08,586
Curse you!

1316
01:40:15,135 --> 01:40:17,595
It's not over yet.

1317
01:40:19,472 --> 01:40:23,852
The fog is lifting!
Quadlings, fall back.

1318
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:26,479
Into the woods!

1319
01:40:26,646 --> 01:40:27,647
Watch out!

1320
01:40:49,502 --> 01:40:51,546
Away with her.

1321
01:41:43,264 --> 01:41:44,599
- Herald.
- Great Wizard.

1322
01:41:44,766 --> 01:41:45,767
Who's this?

1323
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:48,061
Emerald City underground.
Unload the carriage.

1324
01:41:48,228 --> 01:41:51,064
Yes, sir. To the rear. Let's go!

1325
01:41:51,231 --> 01:41:52,440
Let's go.

1326
01:41:52,607 --> 01:41:53,691
You two, get the trolley.

1327
01:41:53,858 --> 01:41:55,610
Everything's ready.
All we need now is you.

1328
01:41:55,693 --> 01:41:56,694
Yeah, come on.

1329
01:41:56,778 --> 01:41:58,863
- I just have to do one thing first.
- There's no time.

1330
01:41:59,030 --> 01:42:00,365
- Get this carriage in position.
- Yes, sir.

1331
01:42:00,532 --> 01:42:01,616
Hurry!

1332
01:42:01,783 --> 01:42:03,743
I told Glinda you would do this.

1333
01:42:03,910 --> 01:42:06,204
She said I was wrong about you.
I guess I wasn't.

1334
01:42:06,287 --> 01:42:07,288
What are you talking about?

1335
01:42:07,372 --> 01:42:09,124
I'm talking about
that thing the Tinker built.

1336
01:42:09,290 --> 01:42:11,126
- The balloon.
- What balloon?

1337
01:42:13,795 --> 01:42:14,879
That's my cue.

1338
01:42:15,630 --> 01:42:19,425
All right, you guys.
Just remember, stick to the plan.

1339
01:42:19,592 --> 01:42:20,802
Stick to the plan?

1340
01:42:20,969 --> 01:42:23,596
The plan was you.
We're supposed to stick to you.

1341
01:42:23,763 --> 01:42:25,932
You guys will do great. So long.

1342
01:42:26,099 --> 01:42:27,892
Come back! We can't do it alone.

1343
01:42:28,059 --> 01:42:30,228
- Wizard!
- Wizard, I don't know what to do!

1344
01:42:55,962 --> 01:42:58,923
Citizens of Emerald City.

1345
01:42:59,090 --> 01:43:03,595
Witness what happens when you defy me.

1346
01:43:07,098 --> 01:43:11,477
Glinda did very well for herself today,
I'll admit.

1347
01:43:11,644 --> 01:43:12,937
Leave her alone!

1348
01:43:13,104 --> 01:43:14,480
Unchain her, you witch!

1349
01:43:14,647 --> 01:43:15,940
We know the truth.

1350
01:43:16,107 --> 01:43:17,192
You poisoned the king!

1351
01:43:17,358 --> 01:43:19,485
Guards! Get them under control.

1352
01:43:19,652 --> 01:43:22,655
The citizens of Emerald City
will not tolerate this!

1353
01:43:22,822 --> 01:43:24,032
We will not!

1354
01:43:24,199 --> 01:43:25,200
Silence!

1355
01:43:27,243 --> 01:43:28,661
Silence!

1356
01:43:33,458 --> 01:43:35,585
What should I do now?

1357
01:43:35,835 --> 01:43:38,087
I'd get your sister and fly out of here.

1358
01:43:38,254 --> 01:43:39,297
Really?

1359
01:43:39,464 --> 01:43:41,132
While you still can.

1360
01:43:41,299 --> 01:43:43,176
I think I'm going to do
something quite different...

1361
01:43:43,343 --> 01:43:45,470
and I'm going to do it...

1362
01:43:45,970 --> 01:43:49,849
very, very slowly, because...

1363
01:43:51,601 --> 01:43:58,107
I just can't take the sight of that
pretty, pretty face.

1364
01:44:00,777 --> 01:44:02,153
I'm going to wipe out your light...

1365
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:05,281
until there is nothing left
but my darkness.

1366
01:44:06,950 --> 01:44:10,328
I have been waiting for this
for a long time.

1367
01:44:30,682 --> 01:44:32,684
Oh, no.

1368
01:44:34,018 --> 01:44:37,230
He said it was going to be
his greatest trick yet.

1369
01:44:37,397 --> 01:44:40,191
Did he tell you the trick was on us?

1370
01:44:49,701 --> 01:44:52,036
How predictable.

1371
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:19,063
I knew that buffoon of yours
couldn't be the Wizard.

1372
01:45:32,785 --> 01:45:35,288
Out of my way!

1373
01:45:43,087 --> 01:45:44,589
Give up, Glinda.

1374
01:45:44,756 --> 01:45:46,799
Why do you continue to resist?

1375
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:49,177
Because I believe in the Wizard.

1376
01:45:50,094 --> 01:45:51,596
So did I, once.

1377
01:45:52,096 --> 01:45:53,765
Behold!

1378
01:45:56,267 --> 01:45:57,602
Look!

1379
01:45:58,019 --> 01:46:00,104
Your Wizard!

1380
01:46:00,897 --> 01:46:02,690
Where is he going?

1381
01:46:02,857 --> 01:46:04,400
He's abandoning us.

1382
01:46:04,567 --> 01:46:06,527
How could he?

1383
01:46:18,122 --> 01:46:19,123
No!

1384
01:46:28,466 --> 01:46:29,467
No!

1385
01:46:44,982 --> 01:46:48,778
Not so great and powerful after all.

1386
01:47:01,165 --> 01:47:03,793
You, there! Move back!

1387
01:47:20,685 --> 01:47:22,186
Hey.

1388
01:47:28,860 --> 01:47:29,861
Hello, monkey.

1389
01:47:30,027 --> 01:47:31,696
Oz!

1390
01:47:32,864 --> 01:47:34,782
I thought you were dead.

1391
01:47:35,867 --> 01:47:37,201
You were crying pretty hard.

1392
01:47:37,452 --> 01:47:38,494
Was that for me?

1393
01:47:38,661 --> 01:47:41,456
No. Some of the smoke got in my eyes.

1394
01:47:41,622 --> 01:47:43,040
Right.

1395
01:47:43,207 --> 01:47:48,004
Wow, you fooled everybody.
That was your greatest trick yet.

1396
01:47:48,171 --> 01:47:49,797
That was just the opening act.

1397
01:47:49,964 --> 01:47:52,008
Let this be the final word.

1398
01:47:52,675 --> 01:47:54,844
Your prophecy is dead.

1399
01:47:55,470 --> 01:47:59,098
Like the king who spoke it,
and the wizard who tried to fulfil it.

1400
01:47:59,265 --> 01:48:01,267
All dead.

1401
01:48:01,476 --> 01:48:02,477
It's showtime.

1402
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:07,482
And they will be joined in death
by Glinda the Good.

1403
01:48:13,905 --> 01:48:15,364
Farewell.

1404
01:48:17,325 --> 01:48:19,911
Say hello to your daddy for me.

1405
01:48:29,128 --> 01:48:32,173
The dreams of the people live on.

1406
01:48:59,075 --> 01:49:02,703
<i>Fear me not, good people of Oz.</i>

1407
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:04,789
<i>Fear me not.</i>

1408
01:49:05,248 --> 01:49:07,250
<i>For it is I...</i>

1409
01:49:07,416 --> 01:49:09,835
<i>the great and powerful...</i>

1410
01:49:10,002 --> 01:49:12,964
<i>Wizard of Oz!</i>

1411
01:49:13,130 --> 01:49:16,634
More tricks? After everything.

1412
01:49:16,801 --> 01:49:18,761
How dare you defy us!

1413
01:49:18,928 --> 01:49:20,471
<i>Dare?</i>

1414
01:49:20,638 --> 01:49:23,182
<i>How dare you, wicked sisters?</i>

1415
01:49:23,349 --> 01:49:25,851
<i>No one defies Oz!</i>

1416
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:28,312
Guards. Destroy him.

1417
01:49:28,479 --> 01:49:29,981
Forward!

1418
01:49:33,317 --> 01:49:34,652
Attack!

1419
01:49:51,627 --> 01:49:54,171
Guards! Come back here this instant!

1420
01:49:58,843 --> 01:50:00,678
You thought you could kill me?

1421
01:50:01,095 --> 01:50:02,471
<i>Me?</i>

1422
01:50:02,638 --> 01:50:05,933
<i>Thanks to you,
I have shed my mortal shell...</i>

1423
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:10,021
<i>and taken my true ethereal form.</i>

1424
01:50:11,939 --> 01:50:15,693
<i>I'm now more powerful than ever.</i>

1425
01:50:16,819 --> 01:50:19,655
<i>I'm invincible!</i>

1426
01:50:19,822 --> 01:50:22,199
<i>Do you still doubt me?</i>

1427
01:50:23,159 --> 01:50:24,869
Doubt you?

1428
01:50:25,036 --> 01:50:27,455
I defy you!

1429
01:50:43,971 --> 01:50:45,723
Beautifully done, sister.

1430
01:50:45,890 --> 01:50:47,183
Thank you.

1431
01:50:48,225 --> 01:50:49,393
Hurry.

1432
01:50:49,894 --> 01:50:50,895
You're taking too much time.

1433
01:50:51,479 --> 01:50:52,813
Hold.

1434
01:50:55,149 --> 01:50:56,734
Hold.

1435
01:51:02,156 --> 01:51:03,532
They think they're winning.

1436
01:51:04,742 --> 01:51:05,743
Turn it back on.

1437
01:51:07,995 --> 01:51:09,914
What? Turn it back on!

1438
01:51:10,081 --> 01:51:11,248
We got a loose wire.

1439
01:51:13,417 --> 01:51:15,503
- Screw's stuck.
- Hold on.

1440
01:51:16,837 --> 01:51:18,339
Use this.

1441
01:51:21,759 --> 01:51:23,260
- Got it.
- Right.

1442
01:51:28,683 --> 01:51:29,684
This can't be.

1443
01:51:31,268 --> 01:51:33,604
<i>You cannot defeat me.</i>

1444
01:51:34,438 --> 01:51:35,940
I'm immortal!

1445
01:51:36,107 --> 01:51:41,153
<i>I am the great and powerful Wizard of Oz!</i>

1446
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:46,575
<i>Now witness and observe...</i>

1447
01:51:46,742 --> 01:51:50,246
<i>as I unleash the stars!</i>

1448
01:51:50,788 --> 01:51:53,082
<i>Behold!</i>

1449
01:52:08,681 --> 01:52:10,349
So, those are fireworks.

1450
01:52:18,149 --> 01:52:19,817
He is the Wizard.

1451
01:52:24,947 --> 01:52:26,532
We got Evanora. She's on the run!

1452
01:52:26,699 --> 01:52:27,908
All right! We got one!

1453
01:52:27,992 --> 01:52:28,993
Yeah!

1454
01:52:35,833 --> 01:52:37,668
Come back here, you coward!

1455
01:52:37,752 --> 01:52:38,753
Glinda.

1456
01:52:38,836 --> 01:52:39,795
It's you.

1457
01:52:39,879 --> 01:52:42,673
And you said that I was the weak one!

1458
01:52:57,813 --> 01:52:58,814
I may not be able to kill you.

1459
01:52:59,023 --> 01:53:00,816
- Now.
- Okay.

1460
01:53:00,983 --> 01:53:03,903
But I can kill the one you love.

1461
01:53:06,447 --> 01:53:07,448
Higher.

1462
01:53:07,531 --> 01:53:09,074
I'm trying.

1463
01:53:26,383 --> 01:53:28,052
Ready! Fire!

1464
01:53:35,142 --> 01:53:37,603
<i>Begone, Wicked Witch!</i>

1465
01:53:37,770 --> 01:53:39,104
<i>Begone!</i>

1466
01:53:39,271 --> 01:53:42,316
I hate you.

1467
01:53:48,113 --> 01:53:51,450
<i>Begone, forevermore!</i>

1468
01:53:52,952 --> 01:53:55,246
The Witch is gone!
The Witch is gone! Yes!

1469
01:53:55,621 --> 01:53:56,664
Bully, bully!

1470
01:53:56,831 --> 01:53:58,249
I knew we could do it.

1471
01:53:58,374 --> 01:53:59,333
Right.

1472
01:53:59,416 --> 01:54:04,088
<i>Theodora, I know your wickedness
is not your doing...</i>

1473
01:54:04,255 --> 01:54:07,758
<i>and should you ever again
find the goodness within you...</i>

1474
01:54:08,259 --> 01:54:09,969
<i>you are welcome to return.</i>

1475
01:54:13,013 --> 01:54:14,849
Never!

1476
01:54:28,404 --> 01:54:30,364
Not so fast.

1477
01:54:32,950 --> 01:54:34,994
You and I aren't finished yet.

1478
01:54:36,912 --> 01:54:39,123
You have the throne, Glinda.

1479
01:54:39,832 --> 01:54:41,584
What more could you want?

1480
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:44,169
You can't give me that.

1481
01:54:45,045 --> 01:54:48,132
You took what mattered most to me.

1482
01:54:48,299 --> 01:54:50,050
My father.

1483
01:54:50,676 --> 01:54:54,221
I'll never again feel
the comfort of his kindness...

1484
01:54:54,388 --> 01:54:56,640
but I'll settle for the freedom
of his people.

1485
01:54:56,891 --> 01:54:58,809
Of course, Glinda.

1486
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:01,812
I think at the very least,
they deserve that.

1487
01:55:11,739 --> 01:55:13,157
What's the matter, Glinda?

1488
01:55:14,158 --> 01:55:15,993
Out of bubbles?

1489
01:55:16,827 --> 01:55:20,497
I don't need them.
Bubbles are just for show.

1490
01:56:42,246 --> 01:56:43,539
What have you done?

1491
01:57:16,280 --> 01:57:18,365
Look what you've done to me!

1492
01:57:19,783 --> 01:57:22,119
Now everyone will see you as you truly are.

1493
01:57:24,955 --> 01:57:29,084
In the name of my father,
I banish you from the Emerald City...

1494
01:57:29,626 --> 01:57:31,545
never to return.

1495
01:58:05,329 --> 01:58:07,122
Good people of Oz...

1496
01:58:07,289 --> 01:58:11,502
I have here a missive
from the great Wizard himself.

1497
01:58:12,628 --> 01:58:15,005
"With little more than pluck and belief...

1498
01:58:15,172 --> 01:58:17,299
"we made the impossible happen.

1499
01:58:18,842 --> 01:58:22,262
"As your Wizard, I hereby decree...

1500
01:58:22,429 --> 01:58:25,015
"the Land of Oz will forever be free."

1501
01:58:45,369 --> 01:58:47,037
Okay.

1502
01:58:47,204 --> 01:58:48,872
Close the curtains, please.

1503
01:58:49,039 --> 01:58:50,999
I'm trying.

1504
01:58:51,166 --> 01:58:52,751
All right.

1505
01:58:54,378 --> 01:58:56,213
Let's give it a try.

1506
01:58:57,214 --> 01:58:58,674
<i>Is it on?</i>

1507
01:58:59,716 --> 01:59:00,717
<i>Is this thing working?</i>

1508
01:59:00,843 --> 01:59:02,719
It's wonderful.

1509
01:59:03,220 --> 01:59:04,555
<i>Well.</i>

1510
01:59:05,597 --> 01:59:08,892
<i>If it isn't the most beautiful witch
in all of Oz.</i>

1511
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:11,562
<i>Hi, Glinda.</i>

1512
01:59:13,397 --> 01:59:14,565
Hello, Wizard.

1513
01:59:17,109 --> 01:59:20,696
Well done, Tinker.
Your machine works beautifully.

1514
01:59:20,904 --> 01:59:22,906
That's just workmanship.

1515
01:59:23,574 --> 01:59:26,535
What you displayed was real courage.

1516
01:59:26,702 --> 01:59:29,371
Your father would have been
more than proud.

1517
01:59:29,538 --> 01:59:32,708
He would have marvelled
at the woman you've become.

1518
01:59:35,085 --> 01:59:36,920
Zim Zallah Bim!

1519
01:59:37,296 --> 01:59:39,423
Excellent work, everyone.

1520
01:59:39,590 --> 01:59:44,428
Now we're ready in case
anyone wants to speak with the Wizard.

1521
01:59:44,803 --> 01:59:46,221
Now, remember...

1522
01:59:46,388 --> 01:59:50,976
Oscar Diggs died,
so that the Wizard of Oz could live.

1523
01:59:51,143 --> 01:59:54,938
When those witches come back,
and they will come back...

1524
01:59:55,105 --> 01:59:58,066
we're going to need everyone to believe.

1525
01:59:58,233 --> 02:00:00,110
Your secret's safe with us.

1526
02:00:00,277 --> 02:00:01,486
Good.

1527
02:00:01,778 --> 02:00:05,073
And now it's time for some gifts.

1528
02:00:05,157 --> 02:00:06,158
Gifts?

1529
02:00:06,241 --> 02:00:07,242
Gifts?

1530
02:00:07,910 --> 02:00:10,120
Knuck, not now.

1531
02:00:11,246 --> 02:00:12,414
What kind of gifts?

1532
02:00:12,581 --> 02:00:16,793
You know I can't grant wishes,
so this will have to do.

1533
02:00:17,252 --> 02:00:19,838
First, the Master Tinker.

1534
02:00:20,005 --> 02:00:23,967
To the man who can make anything,
my lucky...

1535
02:00:25,010 --> 02:00:26,136
thingamajig.

1536
02:00:26,637 --> 02:00:30,349
May it assist you in the reconstruction
of the Emerald City.

1537
02:00:30,515 --> 02:00:32,809
I will cherish this forever.

1538
02:00:33,435 --> 02:00:35,312
Thank you for your faith in me.

1539
02:00:36,605 --> 02:00:39,483
And now for Sourpuss.

1540
02:00:39,816 --> 02:00:41,318
My name is Knuck!

1541
02:00:41,485 --> 02:00:45,489
Sourpuss, I grant you something
you are in need of most.

1542
02:00:45,864 --> 02:00:49,618
Something that, where I come from,
can turn the saddest day...

1543
02:00:49,785 --> 02:00:52,788
into a happy one.

1544
02:00:57,876 --> 02:00:59,878
- I don't want that.
- It is yours.

1545
02:01:00,045 --> 02:01:02,464
- Take it back.
- I cannot.

1546
02:01:07,219 --> 02:01:08,303
Knuck...

1547
02:01:08,971 --> 02:01:10,347
you look nice with a smile.

1548
02:01:12,015 --> 02:01:13,892
You do look nice.

1549
02:01:14,351 --> 02:01:16,186
Thank you.

1550
02:01:17,896 --> 02:01:21,233
Finley, you stood by my side...

1551
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:25,362
when any monkey in his right mind
would have flown away.

1552
02:01:26,154 --> 02:01:29,199
To you, I give something
that I've never given to anyone.

1553
02:01:37,416 --> 02:01:39,584
My friendship.

1554
02:01:41,712 --> 02:01:45,048
Now you're my partner.
You're my friend.

1555
02:01:46,883 --> 02:01:49,261
That's all I ever really wanted.

1556
02:01:52,222 --> 02:01:53,432
My turn, my turn.

1557
02:01:53,557 --> 02:01:54,766
Come here.

1558
02:01:57,853 --> 02:02:02,441
I'm afraid I can't give you
what I know you want most of all.

1559
02:02:04,401 --> 02:02:07,070
All I can offer you is this.

1560
02:02:10,449 --> 02:02:11,950
It's us.

1561
02:02:14,077 --> 02:02:16,079
I know it's not the family
that you had in mind.

1562
02:02:16,246 --> 02:02:17,581
It's perfect.

1563
02:02:21,585 --> 02:02:23,128
Thank you.

1564
02:02:34,181 --> 02:02:36,183
I wonder what you're gonna get.

1565
02:02:36,350 --> 02:02:38,685
I don't need anything, child.

1566
02:02:38,852 --> 02:02:41,438
You better have something for Glinda.

1567
02:02:41,605 --> 02:02:43,106
But of course.

1568
02:02:44,358 --> 02:02:46,943
I've saved the best for last.

1569
02:02:49,780 --> 02:02:51,448
For you...

1570
02:02:51,615 --> 02:02:55,994
a sight envied by all and seen by none.

1571
02:02:56,161 --> 02:03:00,791
You'll be astounded
by what you find behind the curtain.

1572
02:03:05,337 --> 02:03:07,547
Oh, my.

1573
02:03:07,714 --> 02:03:09,383
It's very tight in here.

1574
02:03:09,549 --> 02:03:11,176
It's nice, isn't it?

1575
02:03:12,552 --> 02:03:13,970
I know what you're up to, Wizard.

1576
02:03:14,137 --> 02:03:17,224
What? I'm just giving you a tour.

1577
02:03:17,724 --> 02:03:20,143
And I want to thank you.

1578
02:03:20,644 --> 02:03:22,896
For opening my eyes.

1579
02:03:23,063 --> 02:03:24,815
And what do you see?

1580
02:03:28,485 --> 02:03:30,904
That I have everything I ever wanted.

1581
02:03:35,158 --> 02:03:38,537
For the record,
I knew you had it in you all along.

1582
02:03:40,163 --> 02:03:41,665
Greatness?

1583
02:03:41,832 --> 02:03:44,668
No. Better than that.

1584
02:03:45,335 --> 02:03:46,586
Goodness.

1585
02:04:06,940 --> 02:04:08,400
Now, Knuck.
