<i>- Morning, Mama.
- Morning.</i>

37
00:03:10,485 --> 00:03:12,875
Good morning,
my darlings.

38
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:14,956
You had
a good night?

39
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,883
Yes, Mama.

40
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:20,593
I dreamed we moved out west and
I became a famous gunslinger.

41
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,633
<i>Ha! Like that
could happen.</i>

42
00:03:22,707 --> 00:03:25,358
<i>Well, it seemed real to me.</i>

43
00:03:25,427 --> 00:03:29,038
Look at the time.
Where is your father?

44
00:03:29,106 --> 00:03:31,180
I'll go get him.
No, I will.

45
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:35,307
Morning, Papa.
Time to get up.

46
00:03:36,337 --> 00:03:40,429
Okay, okay. I'm fine.
I'm awake!

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,888
Then how come
you look asleep?

48
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,812
Wishful thinking!

49
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,749
Hurry, Papa, or you'll be late
for your job at the factory.

50
00:03:51,824 --> 00:03:54,213
All right. Okay.
I'm up!

51
00:03:54,287 --> 00:03:56,142
Happy?

52
00:03:56,207 --> 00:03:59,720
I- I was just
trying to help.

53
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,481
Tanya, wait.
I didn't-

54
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:04,102
What's all
the excitement?

55
00:04:06,124 --> 00:04:09,322
Papa's so mean lately.

56
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:12,684
So! I hope
you're satisfied.

57
00:04:12,748 --> 00:04:15,235
Tanya, I'm sorry.

58
00:04:15,308 --> 00:04:17,163
Tell her I'm sorry.

59
00:04:20,586 --> 00:04:22,758
Papa, are you okay?

60
00:04:22,827 --> 00:04:25,194
Ah, Fievel.

61
00:04:25,258 --> 00:04:28,423
It's just that I’m not as young
as I used to be.

62
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:31,304
Me neither!

63
00:04:31,369 --> 00:04:34,337
Fievel, what I mean is
I’m tired.

64
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:36,450
Back in Russia,
I taught music.

65
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:38,375
Sometimes I made
a few violins to sell.

66
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,579
Two jobs was enough.

67
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:42,883
Ay, but here in America,

68
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:45,341
here you need three!

69
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:49,310
Isn't that good?
Well, yes...and no.

70
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:53,342
Yes, because it's the only way for us
to get ahead and build a better life.

71
00:04:53,413 --> 00:04:58,017
And also no, because sometimes
when I'm so worn out,

72
00:04:58,085 --> 00:05:01,467
I forget to be kind
to my own family.

73
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:13,470
<i>Ah, don 't worry Papa.
It'll work out.</i>

74
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:15,393
Like you always tell me,

75
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,240
“In America,
you are truly free.“

76
00:05:18,306 --> 00:05:20,477
Heh-heh-heh.
That is true.

77
00:05:20,545 --> 00:05:23,360
“Free to succeed
and free to fail.“

78
00:05:23,425 --> 00:05:25,912
Ay, that is
also true.

79
00:05:25,985 --> 00:05:28,320
“Free to be
a little crumb one day...

80
00:05:28,385 --> 00:05:30,490
and the next,
a big cheese.“

81
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,112
<i>That is also
also true.</i>

82
00:05:33,183 --> 00:05:35,671
<i>Of course,
he also said...</i>

83
00:05:35,743 --> 00:05:38,198
<i>there were no cats
in America!</i>

84
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,790
<i>Hmph!
That's okay Papa.</i>

85
00:05:40,862 --> 00:05:43,034
You can't be right
about everything.

86
00:05:43,103 --> 00:05:45,175
Little Fievel.

87
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:48,093
It's good you are
so full of hope.

88
00:05:48,157 --> 00:05:51,026
Of course
he's full of hope.

89
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,955
He's your son,
isn't he?

90
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,061
Yeah,
and you're my papa,

91
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:56,987

After all, it was your dad who got
me my job at the cheese factory.

104
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:46,382
Wow, you must be rich!

105
00:06:46,453 --> 00:06:51,340
Oh.
Pardon me. Ha! Ooh.

106
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:54,064
Tiger, I only
been workin' for a week.

107
00:06:54,132 --> 00:06:57,100
Gettin' rich takes
at least... a month!

108

Gee, I can't wait

109
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:01,681
Oh, I wouldn't rush

110
00:07:01,746 --> 00:07:03,600
How come?

111
00:07:03,665 --> 00:07:05,520
Well, now that
I'm working,

112
00:07:05,585 --> 00:07:07,789
I got
responsibilities.

00:07:07,858 --> 00:07:09,450

So... where am I going?

117
00:07:20,848 --> 00:07:25,605
Right in there.
Wow!

118
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:28,646
<i>What is it?
Oh, something I, uh,</i>

119
00:07:28,718 --> 00:07:31,915
personally discovered
just recently.

120
00:07:33,421 --> 00:07:37,197
The Beach Pneumatic Subway.

121
00:07:37,261 --> 00:07:39,203
Beach?
I don't see any beach.

122
00:07:39,276 --> 00:07:41,415
Beach is the guy
who built it.

123
00:07:41,484 --> 00:07:45,924
Oh, good, because I get fleas...
at the beach.

124
00:07:45,995 --> 00:07:50,633
What's a subway?
An underground train.

125
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:52,869
This I gotta see!

126
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:57,247
We're talking about
a really big, nasty,

127
00:07:57,322 --> 00:08:00,584
loud machine here,
right?

128
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:02,242
What are you,
afraid?

129
00:08:02,313 --> 00:08:05,182
<i>Who, me? Ha-ha! No.</i>

130
00:08:05,257 --> 00:08:09,217
<i>I just think it would be better
if! stand guard up here and,</i>

131
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:12,189
<i>uh, and... protect
your flank!</i>

132
00:08:12,263 --> 00:08:16,039
<i>Ha-ha! And we are
supposed to buy this story?</i>

133
00:08:16,103 --> 00:08:19,583
Actually, I was kinda hoping...
yes.

134
00:08:19,654 --> 00:08:21,990
<i>Tony, come on!
Come on!</i>

135
00:08:22,054 --> 00:08:23,908
Fine. Wait here.

136
00:08:23,973 --> 00:08:25,828
Good plan!

137
00:08:49,378 --> 00:08:52,892
- There it is.
- Ooh!

138
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,230
See that huge
fan over there?

139
00:08:59,297 --> 00:09:02,078
When they turned it on,
whoosh!

140
00:09:02,145 --> 00:09:04,380
It blew the car along
so fast...

141
00:09:04,447 --> 00:09:06,488
you slammed back
in your seat.

142
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,901
Wow! Your eyes bugged
out. Your hair stood back.

143
00:09:10,975 --> 00:09:13,691
Your cheeks flapped
in the wind.

144
00:09:22,877 --> 00:09:24,850
<i>Double wow!</i>

145
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:28,085
Problem is, it
didn't work too good.

146
00:09:28,156 --> 00:09:32,629
So about twelve years
ago, they closed it up. Aw!

147
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:34,456
Hey, get a load
of this.

148
00:09:34,523 --> 00:09:36,411
Hello.

149
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,099
<i>Hello. Hello.</i>

150
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,025
Hoo-o-o-o.

151
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,131
<i>Hoo-o-o-o.
Hoo-o-o-o.</i>

152
00:09:42,202 --> 00:09:44,176
Ho-o-o-o-o.

153
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:46,104
Hoo-o-o-o.
Hoo-o-o-o.

154
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,983
Ooh!

155
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:02,545
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three-

156
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:05,583
Oh!
Who am I foolin'?

157
00:10:05,655 --> 00:10:08,044
The only flank
I'm protecting is mine.

158
00:10:08,118 --> 00:10:11,981
Those poor little guys, down there
in that dark pit all by themselves.

159
00:10:12,054 --> 00:10:15,403
Oh! I'm a fraud.
I'm a failure. I'm-

160
00:10:15,476 --> 00:10:17,615
Ahh! I'm goin'
after them.

161
00:10:20,276 --> 00:10:22,796
<i>It's so dark
in here!</i>

162
00:10:42,705 --> 00:10:44,679
Fiev?

163
00:10:44,753 --> 00:10:47,655
Fievel?
Yoo-hoo.

164
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:50,183
Yoo-hoo-hoo.
Tony?

165
00:10:54,223 --> 00:10:56,711
Maybe I can see 'em
from there.

166
00:11:04,365 --> 00:11:06,339
Ahh!

167
00:11:06,413 --> 00:11:08,617
Maybe- Maybe
we oughta go back.

168
00:11:08,684 --> 00:11:11,369
Yeah. Tiger's probably getting
worried about us, huh?

169
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,291
That too.

170
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,494
Uh-oh.

171
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,464
What's that?

172
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:51,970
- Fievel!
Help! I’m stuck!

173
00:12:09,828 --> 00:12:11,802
We're dead, right?

174
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,916
Uh, I don't
think so.

175
00:12:13,986 --> 00:12:15,928
Hey, my body's numb,

176
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:18,338
<i>and I'm staring
into a tunnel of light.</i>

177
00:12:18,403 --> 00:12:21,119
We are talking
deceased here.

178
00:12:21,186 --> 00:12:24,502
Tony, we fell into a hole
underneath the tunnel.

179
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,432
The floor just
gave way.

180
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:29,246
Oh, boy.
Am I relieved.

181
00:12:29,312 --> 00:12:31,615
What kind of place
is this?

182
00:12:31,681 --> 00:12:34,364
You got me,
but from the smell,

183
00:12:34,432 --> 00:12:36,440
I'd say something
crawled in here and...

184
00:12:36,511 --> 00:12:39,227
died!

185
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:45,108
What was that?

186
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:48,248
It's-
Eww!

187
00:12:48,318 --> 00:12:50,620
It's got something
in its paw.

188
00:12:53,084 --> 00:12:55,953
What's it say?
It's too dark.

189
00:12:56,028 --> 00:12:57,883
I'll light a match.

190
00:13:23,641 --> 00:13:27,023
Tony! Fievel!
Where are you?

191
00:13:27,095 --> 00:13:28,885
Ya-hoo!

192
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:33,333
Oh!

193
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,146
Giddyap!

194
00:13:40,214 --> 00:13:42,189
<i>Are you sure
this is the place?</i>

195
00:13:42,262 --> 00:13:44,116
<i>“Absotively."</i>

196
00:13:44,182 --> 00:13:46,996
I helped this guy, Dr. Dithering,
move some stuff last month.

197
00:13:49,044 --> 00:13:51,281
<i>He's real smart.</i>

198
00:13:52,564 --> 00:13:55,914
Ah, my, yes.
Young, uh, young-

199
00:13:55,987 --> 00:13:58,223
Tony.
Tony Toponi.

200
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,594
Yes, of course.
Do- Do come in.

201
00:14:06,098 --> 00:14:08,204
I just-
A little snug in the-

202
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:13,030
<i>So... what brings you here?</i>

203
00:14:13,104 --> 00:14:14,959
<i>Uh, see, my pals and me,</i>

204
00:14:15,024 --> 00:14:17,643
well, we got a question
maybe you could answer.

205
00:14:17,712 --> 00:14:22,185
<i>Fine! Always glad to encourage
young minds and all that.</i>

206
00:14:22,255 --> 00:14:26,728
Great! So... you know that
subway tunnel you told me about?

207
00:14:26,798 --> 00:14:28,653
<i>You said
you discovered it.</i>

208
00:14:28,718 --> 00:14:30,791
I didn't say
I didn't have help.

209
00:14:30,862 --> 00:14:33,676
You didn't
go in there, did you?

210
00:14:33,741 --> 00:14:35,596
I told 'em not to.
Honest I did.

211
00:14:35,661 --> 00:14:38,695
<i>Ah, put a
lid on it, will ya?</i>

212
00:14:38,766 --> 00:14:41,799
Honest. Nothin' happened.

213
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:07,399
- Oh, oh- Careful.
- Ah!

214
00:15:07,465 --> 00:15:11,010
Oh! Delicate, you know.
Sorry.

215
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,862
Anyway, we was walkin'
in the tunnel,

216
00:15:13,927 --> 00:15:15,814
mindin'
our own business-

217
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,953
Then a train came,
and my coat got caught,

218
00:15:18,023 --> 00:15:20,412
and we fell down a hole
and we saw this skeleton.

219
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:22,342
Oh, my.

220
00:15:22,407 --> 00:15:24,294
<i>Nothing happened,
you say?</i>

221
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:26,300
<i>Well, nothin'
permanent, anyway.</i>

222
00:15:26,374 --> 00:15:28,480
<i>Philly, show him the map.
Hmm?</i>

223
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:30,590
<i>Map?</i>

224
00:15:30,661 --> 00:15:32,702
Hmm.
Scuttlebutt?

225
00:15:32,773 --> 00:15:34,976
What?

226
00:15:35,044 --> 00:15:39,747
- What are you doing in there?
- I’m... cataloging. Yeah.

227
00:15:39,812 --> 00:15:43,837
- That's it. I’m keepin' your files up to date.
- Ah, good lad.

228
00:15:43,907 --> 00:15:47,005
Now, I need you to bring over
the large magnifier.

229
00:15:47,074 --> 00:15:49,376
Oh,yes.
The large magnifier.

230
00:15:49,441 --> 00:15:52,759
It's what I live for. Shovin'
around half a ton o' glass.

231
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,688
Who's the ray
of sunshine?

232
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:57,208
My assistant Scuttlebutt.
Odd chap, really.

233
00:15:57,281 --> 00:15:59,964
Always poking about,
wondering what I'm up to.

234
00:16:00,033 --> 00:16:04,768
The large
magnifier, like you asked.

235
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:06,742
Excellent.
Hold this, will you?

236
00:16:06,816 --> 00:16:10,014
Right. But I won't
enjoy it.

237
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:14,206
Hmm.

238
00:16:14,271 --> 00:16:18,133
Ah! This is an artifact from the
former indigenous population.

239
00:16:18,206 --> 00:16:21,403
What does
“in-di-jun-ous“ mean?

240
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,325
<i>The local inhabitants.</i>

241
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,107
<i>What we incorrectly
refer to as “Indians. "</i>

242
00:16:30,653 --> 00:16:33,042
Indians?
Hmm.

243
00:16:33,116 --> 00:16:35,090
<i>Some branch
of the Delaware tribes,</i>

244
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:37,236
or rather, from the size
of this map,

245
00:16:37,307 --> 00:16:39,162
the mice who lived
among them.

246
00:16:39,227 --> 00:16:41,082
Told you
he was smart.

247
00:16:41,147 --> 00:16:44,245
If you’d like, I shall attempt
to decipher it for you.

248
00:16:44,313 --> 00:16:46,419
Hey, Professor, that'd
be terr-

249
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:50,068
Holy spumoni!
I gotta get to the factory!

250
00:16:50,138 --> 00:16:52,821
- What about the map?
- Can't wait!

251
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:55,279
If they catch me comin' late,
I am a dead rodent!

252
00:16:55,353 --> 00:16:57,207
Maybe Tony was right.

253
00:16:57,273 --> 00:16:59,345
Having a job doesn't sound
fun at all.

254
00:16:59,415 --> 00:17:02,067
It has a downside,
definitely. Definitely.

255
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:07,184
<i>That'll do it.</i>

256
00:17:18,229 --> 00:17:21,197
<i>Stop right there!
Oh!</i>

257
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:38,059
What have we here,
Mr. O'Bloat?

258
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,873
Hmm. It appears to be one of
our workers, Mr. Grasping,

259
00:17:41,938 --> 00:17:43,879
but he's late
for his shift.

260
00:17:43,953 --> 00:17:46,474
Well, we can't
have that.

261
00:17:46,545 --> 00:17:48,912
Can we, Mr. Toplofty?
Ay!

262
00:17:48,976 --> 00:17:52,652
No, indeed. Sets a bad example.

263
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:56,877
- Let me explain!
- We don't want excuses, boy.

264
00:17:56,944 --> 00:18:00,238
<i>We want results.
Then don't fire him.</i>

265
00:18:01,742 --> 00:18:04,939
And you are?
My name is Mousekewitz, sir.

266
00:18:05,006 --> 00:18:07,787
All right,
Mousekewitz.

267
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,276
Why should we let
this dawdler keep his job?

268
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:13,131
<i>He won't be late again.
H- He's afraid of you.</i>

269
00:18:13,197 --> 00:18:16,328
<i>I'll make sure he knows
you call the shots.</i>

270
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:18,786
Hmm.
See that you do.

271
00:18:20,428 --> 00:18:24,705
<i>Have you gone soft, Grasping?
Why didn't you fire that boy?</i>

272
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:27,780
Because the Russian
was right.

273
00:18:27,851 --> 00:18:30,949
Fear...
is a powerful motivator.

274
00:18:31,018 --> 00:18:34,367
From now on, that boy will be
the very picture of punctuality.

275
00:18:34,441 --> 00:18:37,028
<i>Yes, well, be that as it may,</i>

276
00:18:37,098 --> 00:18:40,479
why is that old mouse
butting in?

277
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:43,104
Who is he to say
what's right and wrong?

278
00:18:43,175 --> 00:18:45,030
Yes. What is he?

279
00:18:45,095 --> 00:18:47,746
Some sort of
leader among mice?

280
00:18:50,151 --> 00:18:52,867
That spineless
old fool?

281
00:18:52,934 --> 00:18:55,803
He could hardly
look us in the eye.

282
00:18:55,878 --> 00:19:00,253
<i>He may be spineless, but he got
what he wanted out of you.</i>

283
00:19:00,326 --> 00:19:03,173
And that makes him
a troublemaker!

284
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,979
Very well.

285
00:19:07,044 --> 00:19:11,169
<i>Perhaps we will keep an eye
on Mr. Mousekewitz.</i>

286
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,994
The coast is clear.

287
00:19:28,673 --> 00:19:30,528
Ahh!

288
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,495
<i>Easy does it now!</i>

289
00:19:36,672 --> 00:19:40,054
Heave-ho!
Heave-ho!

290
00:19:40,127 --> 00:19:44,666
<i>Heave-ho!
Heave-ho!</i>

291
00:19:44,735 --> 00:19:46,743
<i>Heave-ho!</i>

292
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,663
<i>Easy now.
Lower away.</i>

293
00:19:52,574 --> 00:19:55,061
<i>Seven hundred fifty-one.</i>

294
00:19:57,213 --> 00:19:59,067
<i>Seven hundred
fifty-two.</i>

295
00:20:00,828 --> 00:20:05,170
<i>Seven hundred
fifty-three.</i>

296
00:20:05,243 --> 00:20:07,098
Huh?

297
00:20:07,163 --> 00:20:10,839
Hey, Mr. Mousekewitz. Boy, you
really saved my tail back there.

298
00:20:10,907 --> 00:20:13,754
Thanks.
You're welcome.

299
00:20:13,818 --> 00:20:16,054
The way you spoke up
to them guys-

300
00:20:16,122 --> 00:20:17,977
It was amazin'!

301
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:19,896
You ain't afraid
of nothin'.

302
00:20:19,961 --> 00:20:23,573
<i>No, Tony. Lately
I'm afraid of everything.</i>

303
00:20:23,641 --> 00:20:25,169
I don't get it.

304
00:20:25,241 --> 00:20:28,503
They let you keep your job
because I convinced them...

305
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:33,106
I was a coward and that I could
teach you to be one too!

306
00:20:33,175 --> 00:20:35,925
Ow! Oh!

307
00:20:45,974 --> 00:20:48,014
Ah.

308
00:20:48,085 --> 00:20:49,940
Hmm.

309
00:20:51,252 --> 00:20:53,293
Aha.

310
00:20:56,244 --> 00:20:58,098
<i>Aha!
Ahh!</i>

311
00:20:59,955 --> 00:21:02,094
Oh, my!
We must find Tony!

312
00:21:03,251 --> 00:21:05,902
Ahhh!

313
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,142
Ah. Hey!

314
00:21:08,211 --> 00:21:10,119
What is it?
What does it say?

315
00:21:17,521 --> 00:21:19,724
Here, now.
What's the rush?

316
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:21,679
Oh, lovely.

317
00:21:21,745 --> 00:21:23,980
Thanks.
Here you go.

318
00:21:24,048 --> 00:21:26,949
Here. Here you go.
Thank you.

319
00:21:27,023 --> 00:21:29,477
Nothin' for you, Toponi.

320
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,559
Bosses says you was late.

321
00:21:31,631 --> 00:21:33,485
Well, yeah,
maybe ten minutes.

322
00:21:33,551 --> 00:21:35,786
So I lose
a whole week's pay?

323
00:21:35,853 --> 00:21:39,432
You're lucky you still got a job. Next!

324
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:45,129
<i>- Here. Here ya go. Next.
- Thanks.</i>

325
00:21:45,196 --> 00:21:48,992
<i>Here. Move along.
Come on! Next!</i>

326
00:21:52,972 --> 00:21:56,834
So much for gettin' rich.

327
00:21:58,186 --> 00:22:00,870
Whoa! Tony!

328
00:22:00,938 --> 00:22:03,426
Just the guy
we're lookin' for!

329
00:22:03,498 --> 00:22:06,280
<i>You lads have made
a- a-an amazing discovery!</i>

330
00:22:06,346 --> 00:22:10,022
O- O-One for the history books,
I should think.

331
00:22:10,089 --> 00:22:12,228
What are you
talkini' about?

332
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:15,395
This, uh, map
is a-a diagram...

333
00:22:15,463 --> 00:22:18,333
of an underground
t- t-tunnel system.

334
00:22:18,408 --> 00:22:20,862
You mean the subway?

335
00:22:20,935 --> 00:22:23,870
No, no. Another one,
un-un-underneath it,

336
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:28,001
built centuries ago
by the Indian mice.

337
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,405
Kind of a-
a maze.

338
00:22:30,469 --> 00:22:32,477
Yeah?
That's “a-maze-ing.“

339
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:35,168
Oh, why, yes.

340
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:39,198
But wait until you hear
what's at the bottom of it.

341
00:22:39,268 --> 00:22:41,122
Well?

342
00:22:41,188 --> 00:22:45,149
According to this,
at the end of the maze is-

343
00:22:45,219 --> 00:22:47,193
a- and I quote-

344
00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:49,373
“our greatest treasure.“

345
00:22:49,443 --> 00:22:51,516
- Treasure?
- Treasure?

346
00:22:51,586 --> 00:22:53,976
Treasure!

347
00:22:54,051 --> 00:22:56,702
Absolutely not!

348
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,585
- But, Papa-
- “But, Papa“ nothing.

349
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:02,072
What? You wanna crawl
down some rat hole-

350
00:23:02,145 --> 00:23:05,046
- No offense.
- Oh, none taken.

351
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,607
After some cockamamy
buried treasure?

352
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,917
It's not cockamamy.
It's real!

353
00:23:10,943 --> 00:23:13,496
Mama, can't I go?

354
00:23:13,567 --> 00:23:17,843
Sure. So what if it gives your
mother a heart attack from worrying?

355
00:23:17,918 --> 00:23:20,057
Go! Enjoy!

356
00:23:20,126 --> 00:23:22,460
Ah, Mama.
I'll be okay.

357
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,821
<i>And I'll come back with a treasure.
Ah, feh!</i>

358
00:23:25,885 --> 00:23:28,437
Where is the proof?
A so-called map?

359
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:32,305
Not even written in a language!
just a bunch of d-d-doodles!

360
00:23:32,381 --> 00:23:35,545
I think it's pretty.
Tanya, don't help.

361
00:23:35,612 --> 00:23:38,002
Papa, why did
we leave Russia?

362
00:23:38,076 --> 00:23:40,694
We were going to be eaten.
You need a better reason?

363
00:23:40,763 --> 00:23:42,935
Papa, I'm serious!

364
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,491
You always say that
in America,

365
00:23:45,563 --> 00:23:47,798
if a mouse works hard
and gets lucky,

366
00:23:47,865 --> 00:23:49,720
he can make a fortune.

367
00:23:49,785 --> 00:23:51,640
So?

368
00:23:51,705 --> 00:23:54,192
So finding the map
was the lucky part.

369
00:23:54,265 --> 00:23:57,560
That's the hard work.

370
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:59,632
Philly's right, Mr. M.

371
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:03,413
We're never gonna make it workin' for
those fat rats at the factory.

372
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,366
Please, Papa.

373
00:24:05,431 --> 00:24:07,537
There's no reason
to be afraid.

374
00:24:14,071 --> 00:24:16,340
Okay. So go.

375
00:24:21,301 --> 00:24:23,155
<i>He can't go.
He's just a kid.</i>

376
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,194
<i>I'm older.
Let me go.</i>

377
00:24:25,268 --> 00:24:27,440
Tanya,
don't help.

378
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:31,665
No! If Tanya goes,
nobody goes!

379
00:24:31,732 --> 00:24:33,673
Relax, Mama.
She's not going.

380
00:24:33,747 --> 00:24:35,601
No fair, no fair,
no fair!

381
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:37,521
<i>He always gets to do
the exciting stuff,</i>

382
00:24:37,587 --> 00:24:40,074
and all I get to do is...
laundry.

383
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,000
She does have
a point.

384
00:24:42,066 --> 00:24:44,585
Which only matches
the one on your head.

385
00:24:44,657 --> 00:24:47,974
Tanya, you are staying here,
and that is that!

386
00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:52,936
<i>I am going to put a lot
of starch in everything you wear.</i>

387
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:56,489
I assure you, madam, there is
nothing to be concerned about.

388
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,894
Think of it as a-

389
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:01,327
Well, as a-a field trip.

390
00:25:01,391 --> 00:25:04,424
<i>See?
Think of it as a rite of passage.?</i>

391
00:25:04,494 --> 00:25:08,040
- See?
- Think of it as a disaster waiting to happen.

392
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,630
Tanya, don't help!

393
00:25:10,701 --> 00:25:12,905
<i>Ah, then it's settled!</i>

394
00:25:12,973 --> 00:25:14,828
We'll start off
in the morning.

395
00:25:14,893 --> 00:25:18,024
In the meantime,
we must gather supplies.

396
00:25:18,093 --> 00:25:20,132
Scuttlebutt?

397
00:25:20,203 --> 00:25:22,375
<i>Strange.
Where did he go?</i>

398
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,846
<i>♪♪</i>

399
00:25:33,226 --> 00:25:37,448
<i>So me and the boys cornered
the little rabble-rouser, see?</i>

400
00:25:37,513 --> 00:25:40,133
Then he looks at me and asks,
“Have you no mercy?“

401
00:25:40,202 --> 00:25:42,885
So I says, “Wait, now.
Let me check.

402
00:25:42,953 --> 00:25:44,807
As a matter of fact, no!”

403
00:25:44,872 --> 00:25:46,726
And that's when
we let him have it.

404
00:25:48,776 --> 00:25:51,744
Bravo.

405
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:54,783
The way I see it, every time
a ship docks in the harbor,

406
00:25:54,855 --> 00:25:56,895
we get a new load
of troublemakers.

407
00:25:56,966 --> 00:26:00,131
So it's my job
to keep 'em in line.

408
00:26:00,198 --> 00:26:03,231
That is why
we pay you.

409
00:26:03,301 --> 00:26:07,228
<i>For which I am most grateful.</i>

410
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,952
A Mr. Scuttlebutt, sirs.

411
00:26:10,021 --> 00:26:12,060
Begging your pardons, gents.

412
00:26:12,132 --> 00:26:16,092
Come in, come in. Chief
McBrusque, have you two met?

413
00:26:16,163 --> 00:26:20,124
Well, I don't see any broken
bones, so probably not!

414
00:26:27,362 --> 00:26:29,597
Scuttlebutt here
works with Dr. Dithering,

415
00:26:29,665 --> 00:26:32,665
a pack rat who lives
up in the museum on 79th.

416
00:26:32,737 --> 00:26:34,974
<i>We support Dr. Dithering's
research...</i>

417
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:39,415
as part of our public “commitment
to culture,” but, uh-

418
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,342
What Dithering doesn't know is...

419
00:26:41,407 --> 00:26:44,538
Scuttlebutt reports to us.

420
00:26:44,607 --> 00:26:46,910
<i>Yes, just in case the good
doctor digs up something...</i>

421
00:26:46,975 --> 00:26:49,724
we might like to keep
for ourselves.

422
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:52,245
Well, then, gents,

423
00:26:52,318 --> 00:26:54,424
interested
in a treasure map?

424
00:27:03,357 --> 00:27:05,659
<i>I hope you
find your fortune.</i>

425
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:08,506
Here, Fievel.
Take this for luck.

426
00:27:08,571 --> 00:27:10,426
Thanks, Mama.

427
00:27:10,491 --> 00:27:13,841
- Eh, what is it?
- Matzo ball soup.

428
00:27:13,916 --> 00:27:17,232
Mama, it's not a picnic.
We're exploring a tunnel!

429
00:27:17,306 --> 00:27:20,273
So? A person's got to eat.

430
00:27:20,345 --> 00:27:23,160
<i>I assure you, madam, we have
more than enough provisions,</i>

431
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:25,396
which are also
easier to carry.

432
00:27:25,465 --> 00:27:29,174
That's a matter of opinion.

433
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,826
Don't worry, Mama.
I'll be fine.

434
00:27:33,783 --> 00:27:35,671
He always says that,
but then-

435
00:27:35,736 --> 00:27:38,966
Tanya.
I know, I know. Don't help.

436
00:28:07,794 --> 00:28:10,762
Sure. March me
to the center of the Earth.

437
00:28:10,834 --> 00:28:15,089
Save for the constant pain,
I don't mind at all.

438
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:17,008
Cheer up,
Mr. Scuttlebutt.

439
00:28:17,073 --> 00:28:21,065
If we’re right, there's a reward
waiting at the end of the line.

440
00:28:21,136 --> 00:28:24,169
Heh-heh-heh.
Spotty little runt.

441
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,444
<i>If I had me way, the only thing
waitin' for you...</i>

442
00:28:26,513 --> 00:28:29,065
at the end of the line
would be the end of the line!

443
00:28:37,486 --> 00:28:39,559
I say. Do you
hear something?

444
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,637
Sounds like... running water.

445
00:28:41,709 --> 00:28:46,117
What? Like them injuns had
indoor plumbing? Get off!

446
00:28:46,188 --> 00:28:49,385
I don't know.
It's awful wet.

447
00:28:49,452 --> 00:28:51,558
I believe there's
an underground river...

448
00:28:51,628 --> 00:28:53,482
just beyond this wall.

449
00:28:53,547 --> 00:28:57,290
Ooh, what's this mean?

450
00:28:57,355 --> 00:29:02,025
Ah. It seems the natives
suffered some sort of cataclysm,

451
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:04,872
as in an invasion
or a flood.

452
00:29:04,938 --> 00:29:08,201
Flood! I-I-I'm allergic
to that much water.

453
00:29:08,266 --> 00:29:10,917
Guys? Huh?

454
00:29:12,682 --> 00:29:15,300
<i>Fiev! Tony! Hey,
guys, wait for me!</i>

455
00:29:16,808 --> 00:29:18,816
Get off! Get off!
Get off!

456
00:29:18,888 --> 00:29:21,702
Oh. Uh, sorry.

457
00:29:21,767 --> 00:29:24,103
What you lookin' at?

458
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:25,956
Ooh!

459
00:29:29,863 --> 00:29:33,954
Get a load of this place!

460
00:29:34,021 --> 00:29:35,876
<i>What's goin' on?</i>

461
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:38,330
I'm getting a real
sinking feeling!

462
00:29:38,404 --> 00:29:42,713
Oh, my! Seems we've triggered
some sort of a pressure pad.

463
00:29:42,788 --> 00:29:48,091
- Which means? - Which means we're
going to, uh, what is it? You know-

464
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:51,457
- Die?
- Yes, that's it.

465
00:30:03,138 --> 00:30:05,505
Comin' through! Make way!

466
00:30:31,868 --> 00:30:34,105
Right. I quit.
Live it up. Here you go.

467
00:30:34,173 --> 00:30:36,475
Take it! Take it! Take it!

468
00:30:37,884 --> 00:30:39,892
Huh?

469
00:30:51,898 --> 00:30:54,101
<i>Give me that!</i>

470
00:31:04,343 --> 00:31:06,896
<i>Can we go heme now?</i>

471
00:31:52,688 --> 00:31:56,616
- Uh, where are we?
- Ask them.

472
00:31:59,567 --> 00:32:02,949
- Whoa!
- Here, now, those are sharp!

473
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:07,108
You talk
with the English tongue.

474
00:32:07,182 --> 00:32:09,833
Yes,yes.
English. Right.

475
00:32:09,902 --> 00:32:13,033
Cheerio. Pip-pip.

00:33:03,846 --> 00:33:06,148
but what are you
doing here?

491
00:33:06,213 --> 00:33:09,214
There haven't been Indians
in New York for 200 years.

492
00:33:09,285 --> 00:33:13,081
- You speak of the Lenape.
- Quite so.

493
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:16,092
Lenape is what the Delaware
Indians called themselves.

494
00:33:16,164 --> 00:33:18,172
Our ancestors watched...

495
00:33:18,244 --> 00:33:20,993
as the European humans
came in their boats,

496
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:23,394
bringing disease,
gunpowder-

497
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,078
Cats!

498
00:33:26,146 --> 00:33:28,382
I feel so ashamed!

499
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:32,988
And we watched as the Europeans
mistreated the Lenape.

500
00:33:33,058 --> 00:33:36,222
Killed many...
and scattered the rest.

501
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:40,566
<i>Our ancestors did not wait for the
European mice to do the same to them.</i>

502
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,829
Instead they found refuge
here in the ground,

503
00:33:44,895 --> 00:33:47,448
safe, hidden
from the world.

504
00:33:47,518 --> 00:33:49,755
<i>And that is how
we have stayed!</i>

505
00:33:49,823 --> 00:33:51,897
They're gonna
scalp us! Ahh!

506
00:33:58,397 --> 00:34:01,081
Are you really
gonna scalp us?

507
00:34:01,149 --> 00:34:05,404
Of course not.
We are peaceful mice.

508
00:34:08,028 --> 00:34:11,803
And to prove it, we shall have
a feast in your honor.

509
00:34:11,867 --> 00:34:14,256
Until then,
you will need someone...

510
00:34:14,331 --> 00:34:16,273
to show you
around the cavern.

511
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:18,736

517
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,477
It will be
my pleasure.

518
00:34:36,695 --> 00:34:39,543
- What's this?
- My handmaiden Tankho.

519
00:34:39,607 --> 00:34:42,062
She has volunteered to be your guide.

520
00:34:42,135 --> 00:34:45,931
Then again, that bit about
scalpin' don't sound so bad.

521
00:34:46,007 --> 00:34:49,204
Hee-ya-hay!

522
00:35:01,236 --> 00:35:03,276
<i>Hee-ya-hay!</i>

523
00:35:17,554 --> 00:35:19,943
Oh, that-
Oh, thank you. Hmm.

524
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:22,831
<i>Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.</i>

525
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:28,806
What's he saying?

526
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,978
He's calling upon the spirits
of the earth to embrace you.

527
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:33,989
Great!
When do we start?

528
00:35:34,063 --> 00:35:37,380
It is only
a figure of speech.

529
00:35:37,454 --> 00:35:41,033
Oh, yeah.
Well, I like those.

530
00:35:41,102 --> 00:35:44,233
Mine... mine...
mine... also mine.

531
00:35:44,302 --> 00:35:46,157
Ooh, and this is
mine too.

532
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,144
What are all those drawings
on the stick?

533
00:35:59,212 --> 00:36:01,546
Why is he pouring-
So many questions.

534
00:36:01,611 --> 00:36:04,578
You are like a chirping cricket.
Sorry.

535
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:08,992
Do not apologize. It is good to ask.
That is how we learn.

536
00:36:09,065 --> 00:36:12,196
So... it's okay
to be a cricket?

537
00:36:12,265 --> 00:36:14,371
Yes. In fact,
from now on...

538
00:36:14,441 --> 00:36:16,449
<i>I will call you
Zelozelos.</i>

539
00:36:16,521 --> 00:36:18,889
In our language
that means cricket.

540
00:36:18,953 --> 00:36:22,116
What are you gonna call me?
Hmm.

541
00:36:22,184 --> 00:36:25,151
<i>I will call you...
Pullaook.</i>

542
00:36:25,223 --> 00:36:27,810
<i>Pullaook Yeah.</i>

543
00:36:27,879 --> 00:36:29,919
<i>What means pullaook?</i>

544
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:33,950
It is our word for turkey.
Swell.

545
00:36:39,526 --> 00:36:43,104
<i>You again! Back off!?</i>

546
00:36:43,172 --> 00:36:46,849
<i>You are stealing!
And what are you gonna do about it?</i>

547
00:36:53,539 --> 00:36:56,408
Good grief, man! What could possibly
possess you to do such a thing?

548
00:36:56,482 --> 00:36:59,996
Incredibly poor form!
Nah, you got it all wrong.

549
00:37:00,066 --> 00:37:03,383
Everyone was off dancin', so
I thought I'd tidy up a bit.

550
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:05,629
This is a serious matter.

551
00:37:05,697 --> 00:37:08,697
We open our home to you,
but how do you respond?

552
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:11,617
With thievery...
and deceit!

553
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,535
Chief, you gotta
believe me.

554
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,106
We had nothing to do with this. I
mean, look. The guys a rat, you know?

555
00:37:23,967 --> 00:37:27,413
What is the matter, Zelozelos?
Oh, I just was thinkin'.

556
00:37:27,485 --> 00:37:30,802
We're no better
than Scuttlebutt. See?

557
00:37:30,877 --> 00:37:34,489
We found this map, and it told
us about your... treasure.

558
00:37:34,557 --> 00:37:38,233
to grab it for ourselves.

559
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,715
Just like Scuttlebutt.
You did not know we were here.

560
00:37:41,788 --> 00:37:44,723
You are not thieves.
Yes, we are!

561
00:37:51,963 --> 00:37:53,971
Come with me, Zelozelos.

562
00:37:55,514 --> 00:37:58,295
This...
is our greatest treasure.

563
00:37:58,362 --> 00:38:01,078
But... it’s just
a string of beads!

564
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:02,999
It is wampum.

565
00:38:03,064 --> 00:38:05,933
It is the history of our tribe
told in symbols.

566
00:38:06,008 --> 00:38:08,660
W- We risked our lives
for that?

567
00:38:12,695 --> 00:38:16,209
Zelozelos, treasure
comes in many forms.

568
00:38:16,279 --> 00:38:18,165
For us,
it is our heritage.

569
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:21,361
<i>The wampum reminds us
of our life with the Lenape,</i>

570
00:38:21,429 --> 00:38:26,383
<i>of our journey here and being separated
from everything we once knew.</i>

571
00:38:26,453 --> 00:38:28,307
See what I mean?

572
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:30,860
The settlers just stomped in
and took over.

573
00:38:30,932 --> 00:38:35,340
If that’s the American dream,
I want nothing to do with it!

574
00:38:35,412 --> 00:38:37,452
Do not be hasty,
Zelozelos.

575
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:41,386
<i>This dream of yours
is a wonderful thing,</i>

576
00:38:41,459 --> 00:38:45,005

been taken to heart.

Hey, I know! Cholena, why
don't you come back with us?

617
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:46,636
You mean...
to the surface?

618
00:41:46,711 --> 00:41:49,395
Yeah. You've shown us
all of your world.

619
00:41:49,462 --> 00:41:52,178
We could show you ours.
Ow!

620
00:41:54,709 --> 00:41:57,230
“Posituvely.“
Oh-

621
00:42:10,772 --> 00:42:15,212
Good-bye, Father. May the spirits
protect you during your journey, daughter.

622
00:42:17,746 --> 00:42:21,521
Remember, Cholena: Make no
contact with the upper-worlders.

623
00:42:21,585 --> 00:42:26,375
Your task is to see if they have
changed their deceitful ways,

624
00:42:26,448 --> 00:42:29,711
however unlikely
that may be.

625
00:42:29,776 --> 00:42:32,874
As you wish, Father.

626
00:42:32,944 --> 00:42:35,147
Don't worry.
She'll have a great time.

627
00:42:35,215 --> 00:42:37,486
Besides,
what can happen?

628
00:42:39,055 --> 00:42:44,587
<i>- Your attention, please.
- Huh?</i>

629
00:42:44,654 --> 00:42:46,476
I am pleased to announce
that my associates and I...

630
00:42:46,542 --> 00:42:51,397
<i>now control all cheese manufacturing
in the tristate area.</i>

631
00:42:57,388 --> 00:42:59,975
Oh, come, now.
This is great news.

632
00:43:00,043 --> 00:43:02,728
Course, all of you will
have to triple your output.

633
00:43:02,796 --> 00:43:04,803
<i>"Triple your output"?
Triple our output?</i>

634
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:08,900
- What's in it for us?
- Your jobs, that's what.

635
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:11,306
We work too many hours
as it is.

636
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:14,534
That's right!

637
00:43:14,602 --> 00:43:17,700
Calm down! Calm down!
Don't make trouble!

638
00:43:26,407 --> 00:43:30,051
We're workin's' ourselves to the
bone while you're all gettin' fat!

639
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:32,933
How about
cutting us in?

640
00:43:32,998 --> 00:43:35,649
<i>Actually, we're
cutting you out!</i>

641
00:43:40,133 --> 00:43:44,291
Ayshh!
This is like Russia all over again!

642
00:43:46,116 --> 00:43:47,807
Aw.

643
00:43:47,876 --> 00:43:50,625
<i>You feelin' homesick,
old mouse?</i>

644
00:43:50,692 --> 00:43:53,212
Hey, I’m talkin' to you!
You see?

645
00:43:53,283 --> 00:43:56,284
There's that Mousekewitz
again, stirring up trouble.

646
00:43:56,356 --> 00:43:59,552
They're all ungrateful louts,
and it’s just the beginning.

647
00:43:59,618 --> 00:44:01,888
Dissent is like a disease.

648
00:44:01,955 --> 00:44:06,329
So we must cure them of it,
before the infection spreads.

649
00:44:21,056 --> 00:44:22,998
We could use
some help, you know.

650
00:44:23,072 --> 00:44:26,846
Nothing showy. Just a sign
to let us know you're listening.

651
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,122
- Fievel!
- Papa!

652
00:44:40,188 --> 00:44:43,090
Oh, it's about time
you got home.

653
00:44:43,164 --> 00:44:45,651
I want to hear everything,
but first,

654
00:44:45,723 --> 00:44:48,854
oh, you wouldn't believe
what happened at the factory.

655
00:44:48,923 --> 00:44:52,915
Papa, we have a guest.

656
00:44:52,986 --> 00:44:56,565
A pleasure, I'm sure.
So, as I was saying-

657
00:44:56,634 --> 00:44:58,869
Papa,
this is Cholena.

658
00:44:58,937 --> 00:45:01,589
It is an honor to meet the
father of my friend Fievel.

659
00:45:01,658 --> 00:45:06,032
<i>- Y-Y-You are an Indian?
- Yeah.</i>

660
00:45:06,105 --> 00:45:10,196
She's from this old tribe that lives in
a big cave right under New York City.

661
00:45:11,287 --> 00:45:13,393
This is your idea
of a sign?

662
00:46:20,621 --> 00:46:22,476
An Indian?
Uh-huh.

663
00:46:22,541 --> 00:46:25,355
That's charming. First you let
Mousekewitz tell you what to do.

664
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:28,486
Now his son is giving that
little princess a guided tour.

665
00:46:28,556 --> 00:46:31,043
We have to
find her, fast!

666
00:46:31,115 --> 00:46:33,897
Forget about her. What
about the rest of them?

667
00:46:33,963 --> 00:46:39,364
Good gravy! A tribe of savages right
under our feet? What if they invade us?

668
00:46:39,435 --> 00:46:42,849
Ah, they wouldn't stand a
chance against my boys.

669
00:46:42,921 --> 00:46:44,776
And what makes you
so sure?

670
00:46:44,841 --> 00:46:48,485
Well, for one thing,
we don't fight fair!

671
00:46:48,553 --> 00:46:52,415
Oh. That does make a difference.

672
00:46:53,065 --> 00:46:55,847
You're all
missing the point.

673
00:46:55,912 --> 00:47:00,646
These Indians are the answer to
our problems with the workers.

674
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:03,907
<i>Are you mad?
Not at all.</i>

675
00:47:03,975 --> 00:47:05,949
The best way to keep
those malingerers in line...

676
00:47:06,022 --> 00:47:09,852
is to provide them- and us-
with a common enemy.

677
00:47:09,926 --> 00:47:14,748
I see. We set ourselves up as the
workers' champions and protectors.

678
00:47:14,821 --> 00:47:17,373
And turn them
against the Indians.

679
00:47:17,444 --> 00:47:21,634
Of course, there'll be horrible
losses among the workers.

680
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,416
<i>But if we 're clever
about it, most of them...</i>

681
00:47:24,483 --> 00:47:27,778
will be the anarchists
and miscreants in the crowd.

682
00:47:27,843 --> 00:47:31,225
Gentlemen,
a toast to us.

683
00:47:31,299 --> 00:47:34,648

We come to you
not as your bosses...

720
00:49:45,102 --> 00:49:48,070
but as fellow American mice,

721
00:49:48,142 --> 00:49:51,110
out of concern
for you and your families.

722
00:49:51,182 --> 00:49:53,636
For it has come
to our attention...

723
00:49:53,709 --> 00:49:57,669
that there is a spy
in our midst.

724
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:00,359
Yes, a spy.

725
00:50:00,428 --> 00:50:03,395
Whose mere presence
chills us to the bone.

726
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:06,468
A savage, bloodthirsty,

727
00:50:06,539 --> 00:50:08,394
<i>injun.</i>

728
00:50:08,459 --> 00:50:11,459
What's more,

729
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:13,538
this interloper
is the spearhead...

730
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:16,392
<i>of a sinister
invasion force!</i>

731
00:50:16,458 --> 00:50:20,004
These fiends are not attacking
from some far-off shore.

732
00:50:20,073 --> 00:50:23,936
No! Even as we speak,
they lie in wait...

733
00:50:24,009 --> 00:50:26,311
beneath our very paws.

734
00:50:26,376 --> 00:50:30,750
Oh, he knows about the cave.
He's talking about Cholena!

735
00:50:30,823 --> 00:50:34,466
<i>Now, you all know
what these creatures are like.</i>

736
00:50:34,535 --> 00:50:37,023
<i>If we let them,
they'll steal our food,</i>

737
00:50:37,095 --> 00:50:40,673
<i>burn our homes,
kidnap our children.</i>

738
00:50:46,693 --> 00:50:52,225
If we let them, they will destroy
everything we have worked for.

739
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:58,300
So now the question is,
will we let them?

740
00:50:58,371 --> 00:51:03,193
Will we stand by and let them
ruin our American way of life?

741
00:51:03,266 --> 00:51:05,885
No!
No!

742
00:51:05,954 --> 00:51:08,954
Then let us
go forth together.

743
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:10,880
Let us find
the infiltrator...

744
00:51:10,945 --> 00:51:15,102
and send her back to her fellow
barbarians with a message...

745
00:51:15,168 --> 00:51:18,201
<i>that this land
is our land,</i>

746
00:51:18,272 --> 00:51:21,753
<i>and we are going to keep it that way.</i>

747
00:51:23,967 --> 00:51:26,868
A week's pay for the first one
who sees the injun!

748
00:51:26,942 --> 00:51:29,724
Two weeks' pay for anyone
who helps catch her!

749
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:31,929
Hurry! Hurry!

750
00:51:40,732 --> 00:51:44,082
Nobody's invading nobody!
Wait! Oof!

751
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:52,466
Well, if it isn't Mousekewitz,
king of the troublemakers.

752
00:51:52,539 --> 00:51:54,961
I've been
looking forward to this.

753
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:58,104
Grab him!

754
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:16,947
Oy.

755
00:52:17,015 --> 00:52:19,830
Huh?

756
00:52:28,181 --> 00:52:31,312
Believe me, I'm not
going to like this either.

757
00:52:39,443 --> 00:52:41,452
<i>Okay, old man.</i>

758
00:52:41,524 --> 00:52:45,319
You go hide the Indian.
All the better for me.

759
00:52:45,394 --> 00:52:48,525
Help! I can't see!
I can't see!

760
00:52:52,625 --> 00:52:55,146
Oh, yeah.
That's much better.

761
00:52:55,889 --> 00:52:57,614
Okeydokey,
who wants more?

762
00:52:57,681 --> 00:52:59,568
Oh, no, thank you, Mama.

763
00:52:59,633 --> 00:53:02,666
Oh, now you don't like
my blintzes?

764
00:53:02,737 --> 00:53:05,322
No, Mama.
We're just stuffed.

765
00:53:05,392 --> 00:53:09,866
Stuffed, schmuffed! Meanwhile, there
are mice starving in Irkutsk.

766
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:12,936
My ma used to say
the same thing.

767
00:53:13,007 --> 00:53:15,178
'Cept her mice
were starvin' in Sicily.

768
00:53:15,247 --> 00:53:18,476
See? It's an epidemic. Now eat.

769
00:53:21,902 --> 00:53:24,902
Papa, what's the matter?

770
00:53:24,973 --> 00:53:28,835
A mob is coming, looking for
Cholena, and the police too!

771
00:53:28,908 --> 00:53:32,836
Tanya, get the baby!
W- What are police?

772
00:53:32,907 --> 00:53:36,738
They're these guys. They wear uniforms, and
they make sure everyone obeys the law.

773
00:53:36,812 --> 00:53:38,569
Th-Then they
will help us.

774
00:53:38,635 --> 00:53:40,577
No.

775
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:45,000
<i>Here they come!</i>

776
00:53:48,426 --> 00:53:51,142
If we stay here, they’ll
find Cholena for sure!

777
00:53:51,209 --> 00:53:54,340
Hurry! Wear this,
and keep your head down!

778
00:53:58,888 --> 00:54:02,019
<i>My guess is she's
probably wearin' a disguise.</i>

779
00:54:02,087 --> 00:54:05,436
Search every rat nest
and mouse hole in the city.

780
00:54:05,511 --> 00:54:08,861
Tear everything apart
until you find that injun!

781
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:13,246
- Now go!
- Yes, sir!

782
00:54:13,317 --> 00:54:16,765
<i>There he is!</i>

783
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:18,723
Stop this instant!
Let me go!

784
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:21,637
<i>You're in on
the injun plot, aren't ya?</i>

785
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,806
<i>Don't deny it!</i>

786
00:54:23,876 --> 00:54:26,428
What plot?
Oh, Scuttlebutt!

787
00:54:26,499 --> 00:54:29,882
<i>Thank heavens. Quickly!
Tell them I'm innocent.</i>

788
00:54:29,955 --> 00:54:32,956
Who? Me? No. No, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

789
00:54:33,027 --> 00:54:36,474
Never seen the bloke in me life!
Traitor! Turncoat!

790
00:54:39,681 --> 00:54:41,536
Whew!

791
00:54:41,601 --> 00:54:44,732
Papa! Mama!

792
00:54:44,801 --> 00:54:47,070
Tanya!

793
00:54:48,544 --> 00:54:50,454
<i>Help me!</i>

794
00:54:50,527 --> 00:54:52,382
Get that girl!

795
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,250
<i>- Traitors!
- Cholena!</i>

796
00:55:00,318 --> 00:55:03,134
Buzz off, kid!
Aaah!

797
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:05,751
Hang on!
I'm comin'!

798
00:55:05,822 --> 00:55:08,408
- Ooh!
- Indians!

799
00:55:08,477 --> 00:55:12,634
We've got to save Cholena.
Ow! Hey! I’m with ya!

800
00:55:12,701 --> 00:55:14,676
<i>Fievel!
Make 'em pay!</i>

801
00:55:15,708 --> 00:55:17,366
Oh! Uh!

802
00:55:25,627 --> 00:55:28,017
Fievel! Tanya!

803
00:55:31,738 --> 00:55:35,153
In here, Papa.
Ah-ah-choo!

804
00:55:35,226 --> 00:55:40,113
Oh! My poor darlings!

805
00:55:40,185 --> 00:55:43,960
Where are Fievel and Tony?
And where is Cholena?

806
00:55:44,024 --> 00:55:47,319
She must have been
carried away by the mob.

807
00:55:47,384 --> 00:55:50,864
Oh, if they recognize her,
they'll-

808
00:55:50,935 --> 00:55:55,212
Tanya. Find Fievel and Tony.
Then meet us back here.

809
00:55:55,286 --> 00:55:57,141
Mama and I
are going for help.

810
00:55:57,206 --> 00:55:59,443
We are?
Who's going to help?

811
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:01,550
Could everyone
just go and do?

812
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:09,232
Oh, my! Oh, help!

813
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,242
Oh, oh- Help!

814
00:56:14,356 --> 00:56:16,209
We got one
of the traitors!

815
00:56:16,275 --> 00:56:20,050
Good. Take him
to the butcher shop. Huh?

816
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:25,997
What have we here?

817
00:56:26,065 --> 00:56:28,520
But don't do nothin'
till we get there!

818
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:31,407
We've got a little
unfinished business.

819
00:56:53,677 --> 00:56:55,948
<i>Well,
what do ya know?</i>

820
00:56:56,014 --> 00:57:00,268
It's the little
Indian maiden.

821
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:02,241
<i>Yo, potato-for-brains!
Up here!</i>

822
00:57:03,724 --> 00:57:06,146
Charge!

823
00:57:09,163 --> 00:57:11,749
Yah!

824
00:57:11,819 --> 00:57:13,860
Oh, thank you.

825
00:57:14,955 --> 00:57:16,809
Fievel, would you hurry?

826
00:57:18,538 --> 00:57:20,644
Come back here,
ya hooligans!

827
00:57:23,017 --> 00:57:26,912
Papa? Mama?
Papa said they'd be here.

828
00:57:26,984 --> 00:57:30,530
What if the mob got 'em?
What if they’re in jail?

829
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,542
What if-
What if we stop already?

830
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:35,878
Papa! Mama!
Mama, you're okay.

831
00:57:35,943 --> 00:57:39,968
Fievel, you and Tony take
Cholena back underground.

832
00:57:40,038 --> 00:57:41,893
Wait a minute!
What about me?

833
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:44,031
It's not fair! I never
get a chance to do any-

834
00:57:44,102 --> 00:57:46,339
Okay. Okay, already.
Go.

835
00:57:46,406 --> 00:57:48,609
Honest?
You mean it?

836
00:57:48,677 --> 00:57:50,586
Yes! Ya-hoo!

837
00:57:50,661 --> 00:57:53,050
I mean- Ahem. Good.

838
00:57:53,124 --> 00:57:54,979
Fievel,
you have the map?

839
00:57:55,044 --> 00:57:57,858
Sure, but what
are you gonna do?

840
00:57:57,924 --> 00:57:59,778
While you take Cholena home,

841
00:57:59,844 --> 00:58:03,487
Mama and I will keep the crowd
occupied and save Dr. Dithering.

842
00:58:03,555 --> 00:58:05,825
Gee, how you
gonna do that?

843
00:58:05,891 --> 00:58:09,152
We will create
a diversion.

844
00:58:09,217 --> 00:58:11,072
What's a “diversion“?

845
00:58:11,137 --> 00:58:14,006
Me.

846
00:58:22,944 --> 00:58:27,450
Look. ls it wise for us to be here?
I mean, that mob's out for blood!

847
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:31,828
Yes, but since McBrusque here
failed to catch the Indian girl,

848
00:58:31,902 --> 00:58:34,935
<i>we 'll have to make Dr.
Dithering the designated donor.</i>

849
00:58:35,006 --> 00:58:38,323
Dr. Dithering, do you admit
to aiding the Indian?

850
00:58:38,398 --> 00:58:40,252
Well, yes,
but I don't see why-

851
00:58:40,317 --> 00:58:42,172
Guilty!
Guilty!

852
00:58:42,237 --> 00:58:44,212
Guilty! Make him pay!

853
00:58:44,285 --> 00:58:47,416
- You heard the man!
- Guilty!

854
00:58:47,485 --> 00:58:49,819
<i>Guilty!
Guilty!</i>

855
00:59:03,514 --> 00:59:06,383
Oh, oh, oh, my.
Oh-oh!

856
00:59:10,841 --> 00:59:12,598
Excuse me for just
one minute, Doc.

857
00:59:19,127 --> 00:59:21,496
Woof!

858
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,414
Wrong species.

859
00:59:23,479 --> 00:59:26,894
<i>Stop! Enough!</i>

860
00:59:26,966 --> 00:59:30,381
Didn't we come to America
to escape such madness?

861
00:59:30,454 --> 00:59:35,155
Yet here you are, condemning
someone based on lies and rumors.

862
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:37,075
Don't you see?

863
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:40,687
The enemy isn't Dr. Dithering
or the Indians.

864
00:59:40,757 --> 00:59:42,350
It's them!

865
00:59:42,421 --> 00:59:47,886
<i>Dividing us with hatred,
ignorance, fear.</i>

866
00:59:47,955 --> 00:59:52,330
Don't listen to him! He's not one of us!
He's a foreigner!

867
00:59:52,403 --> 00:59:56,592
Mister, we are
all foreigners.

868
00:59:56,658 --> 01:00:00,520
The only ones who really
belong here are the Indians.

869
01:00:00,593 --> 01:00:02,863
<i>[PapaJ All the rest of
us have in common...</i>

870
01:00:02,929 --> 01:00:05,319
<i>is our dream
of a better life.</i>

871
01:00:05,392 --> 01:00:09,222
All we got in common
is America.

872
01:00:13,775 --> 01:00:16,840
<i>Bravo!
Bravo! Bravo!</i>

873
01:00:18,543 --> 01:00:20,201
Get us out of here!

874
01:00:23,726 --> 01:00:26,312
<i>Stand back there!
I'll split your noggin!</i>

875
01:00:26,381 --> 01:00:29,250
Congratulations,
Grasping.

876
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:32,806
Now you've got every mouse
in Manhattan hating us!

877
01:00:32,877 --> 01:00:35,691
What if the Indians
send reinforcements?

878
01:00:35,756 --> 01:00:40,164
Form an alliance with the workers?
Take over the factory?

879
01:00:40,235 --> 01:00:43,846
Get a grip on yourself! We're
not through yet. McBrusque!

880
01:00:43,914 --> 01:00:48,071
- Yes, sir.
- Find that Indian cave, and turn it into a burial ground.

881
01:00:48,138 --> 01:00:51,847
Yes, sir!
Ah, good luck with that.

882
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:55,230
Which reminds me.
I'm gonna need a guide.

883
01:00:55,304 --> 01:00:57,825
I'd sooner die
than go down there again.

884
01:00:57,897 --> 01:01:01,606
Well, that just about sums
up your choices, doesn't it?

885
01:01:18,725 --> 01:01:20,612
Stop. Stop! Stop!

886
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,718
Here it is!

887
01:01:22,789 --> 01:01:25,025
<i>- Huh?
- This way, boys.</i>

888
01:01:25,092 --> 01:01:27,547
It's Chief McBrusque, and
he's got his goons with him.

889
01:01:31,875 --> 01:01:34,624
Here.

890
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,861
I love the smell of it.

891
01:01:40,194 --> 01:01:43,358
<i>- Which way?
- We're gainin' on 'em, boys!</i>

892
01:01:46,913 --> 01:01:49,335
Oh, I wish Dr. Dithering
were here!

893
01:01:49,409 --> 01:01:52,856
Wait! Those are
our footprints from before.

894
01:01:52,928 --> 01:01:54,782
This way!

895
01:01:56,127 --> 01:01:58,266
I’m tellint' ya, turn back!

896
01:01:58,335 --> 01:02:00,571
Those injuns
are fiends, brutes!

897
01:02:00,639 --> 01:02:02,428
They tried to scalp me.

898
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:05,342
You keep whinin',
and I might let 'em.

899
01:02:05,406 --> 01:02:07,260
Suit yourself,

900
01:02:07,326 --> 01:02:09,660
but when we're all walkin' around
like a rack of snooker balls,

901
01:02:09,725 --> 01:02:11,580
don't blame me.

902
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:13,850
Yow-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Ooh! Ooh!

903
01:02:19,164 --> 01:02:22,230
- Tanya, no!
- What's the matter?

904
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:25,235
The room on the other side
is full of booby traps.

905
01:02:25,307 --> 01:02:27,347
Whoa!
That's right.

906
01:02:27,418 --> 01:02:29,906
We barely got through
there in one piece.

907
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:33,393
So we either go in there
or back up to meet the cops.

908
01:02:33,466 --> 01:02:36,728
Wait. My father once told me
of a way around the traps.

909
01:02:36,793 --> 01:02:39,313
If only I could remember.

910
01:02:39,385 --> 01:02:43,029
I can almost see it,
as if it were here in my paw.

911
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:46,446
That's it!
Fievel, what are you doing?

912
01:02:47,768 --> 01:02:51,117
I wondered what that paw print
on the map meant.

913
01:02:51,191 --> 01:02:53,362
Look!

914
01:02:59,543 --> 01:03:01,430
Hurry!

915
01:03:14,772 --> 01:03:17,740
No! Sorry. Stop.

916
01:03:17,811 --> 01:03:20,364
As far as I go.

917
01:03:20,435 --> 01:03:23,217
<i>What's the matter now!</i>

918
01:03:23,283 --> 01:03:25,835
You go through
that door,

919
01:03:25,906 --> 01:03:27,848
you're gonna be
minced mouse pie!

920
01:03:28,978 --> 01:03:31,051
Are you tellin' me
that we're almost there?

921
01:03:31,122 --> 01:03:32,976
Well, yes and no.

922
01:03:33,041 --> 01:03:37,165
About time. All right, men.
Attack formation.

923
01:03:39,568 --> 01:03:41,608
<i>Charge!</i>

924
01:03:52,878 --> 01:03:54,733
<i>Wow!</i>

925
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:58,758
You got that right.
Forgive me, Father. I failed.

926
01:03:58,829 --> 01:04:04,361
Cholena, do not blame yourself
for the ways of the upper world.

927
01:04:04,428 --> 01:04:08,290
It is not your fault that they
are still greedy and ruthless.

928
01:04:08,363 --> 01:04:11,461
Not all of us.
just some.

929
01:04:13,451 --> 01:04:15,590
What are you
going to do?

930
01:04:15,659 --> 01:04:19,750
We do not have any choice.
We will defend ourselves.

931
01:04:19,819 --> 01:04:22,404
But I fear that we will
go down in defeat.

932
01:04:22,473 --> 01:04:25,604
Hey, what about
all those booby traps?

933
01:04:25,673 --> 01:04:27,647
All you need is
a few more and-

934
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:31,234
They were built long ago
by our ancestors.

935
01:04:31,304 --> 01:04:33,922
Today, we do not know
the ways of war.

936
01:04:33,991 --> 01:04:37,439
We are no match
for the upper-worlders.

937
01:04:37,511 --> 01:04:41,504
Maybe you don't have to be.
What do you mean?

938
01:04:41,575 --> 01:04:43,615
It's like what Papa said.

939
01:04:43,686 --> 01:04:46,021
We need to create
a diversion.

940
01:04:50,982 --> 01:04:53,501
Now I’m angry-

941
01:04:54,692 --> 01:04:56,547
Told ya it was dangerous.
Did anyone listen?

942
01:04:56,612 --> 01:04:59,361
No. Might as well have been
talkin' to a brick wall!

943
01:05:07,075 --> 01:05:11,002
All right. Where are they?

944
01:05:13,378 --> 01:05:16,694
Cowards! Soon as they heard us
comin', they turned tail!

945
01:05:24,512 --> 01:05:26,902
Now!

946
01:05:46,749 --> 01:05:48,757
Where do ya think
you're goin'?

947
01:05:48,829 --> 01:05:50,356
Home!

948
01:05:50,428 --> 01:05:53,429
Ow.

949
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:57,460
I suppose I should
expect this by now.

950
01:06:10,969 --> 01:06:15,573
Come back, ya nose-wipin',
tail-turnin', double-dealin'-

951
01:06:19,607 --> 01:06:22,127
Aw, forget it.

952
01:06:23,575 --> 01:06:25,430
Wait for me!

953
01:06:31,286 --> 01:06:33,457
<i>Yeah!
Hooray!</i>

954
01:06:33,526 --> 01:06:36,340
Oh, Father, we are safe.

955
01:06:36,406 --> 01:06:39,852
Not for long, child. The
upper-worlders will be back.

956
01:06:39,924 --> 01:06:41,648
<i>They will come
in greater numbers...</i>

957
01:06:41,716 --> 01:06:45,579
with more powerful weapons,
and we will be lost.

958
01:06:45,652 --> 01:06:48,521
Isn't there anything
you can do?

959
01:06:48,596 --> 01:06:51,083
Yes.
Seal the ancient tunnel.

960
01:06:51,155 --> 01:06:53,424
No. You'll be
buried alive!

961
01:06:53,491 --> 01:06:57,102
Do not worry. Our air
shafts will not be harmed.

962
01:06:57,170 --> 01:07:00,520
Besides, we have other ways
to visit the upper world.

963
01:07:00,593 --> 01:07:04,205
You do? Where?

964
01:07:04,273 --> 01:07:07,917
Perhaps it is better
that you do not know.

965
01:07:07,984 --> 01:07:10,058
Remember, Zelozelos.

966
01:07:10,128 --> 01:07:13,805
The upper world is a gift
from the Great Spirit.

967
01:07:13,872 --> 01:07:17,864
Perhaps someday the mice there
will learn to share it.

968
01:07:17,935 --> 01:07:19,790
Perhaps you
can teach them.

969
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:25,924
Uh, Chief, exactly how do you
plan to seal the tunnel?

970
01:07:25,997 --> 01:07:29,194
Show me the map.

971
01:07:29,261 --> 01:07:34,630
There. There is a great underground
river here, close to the tunnel.

972
01:07:34,701 --> 01:07:36,457
Yeah, I remember.

973
01:07:36,524 --> 01:07:41,346
Once you find it again, you must destroy the
wall that separates one from the other.

974
01:07:42,795 --> 01:07:45,130
Uh, how we
supposed to do that?

975
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:52,902
Take this.

976
01:07:52,969 --> 01:07:54,911
Better not be
a cat in here.

977
01:07:54,985 --> 01:07:57,472
No. Gunpowder.

978
01:07:57,545 --> 01:08:00,742
Whoa! No sweat.

979
01:08:00,808 --> 01:08:03,710
But you said gunpowder
was evil.

980
01:08:03,784 --> 01:08:09,381
Mm. It is, and we would never
use it to harm anyone else.

981
01:08:09,447 --> 01:08:12,512
But we can put it to a good
use and protect ourselves.

982
01:08:12,583 --> 01:08:16,030
<i>Place the box where the
river's roar is loudest.</i>

983
01:08:16,102 --> 01:08:19,516
Light the fuse,
and then run.

984
01:08:19,589 --> 01:08:22,819
I'll never
forget you, Cholena.

985
01:08:22,885 --> 01:08:25,853
And I will never
forget you.

986
01:08:25,925 --> 01:08:28,314
Farewell.
Thank you.

987
01:08:31,715 --> 01:08:36,385
Huh-huh! Steady there, Romeo,
or we all go up in smoke.

988
01:08:36,451 --> 01:08:38,426
Come on!

989
01:08:40,098 --> 01:08:41,723
There it is.

990
01:08:47,329 --> 01:08:50,940
Okay. Now all we have to do
is light the gunpowder.

991
01:08:51,008 --> 01:08:54,423
Sure. Simple. No problem.

992
01:08:54,496 --> 01:08:58,358
You do it.
I- I-I can't.

993
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:04,629
Where do you think
you're going?

994
01:09:05,791 --> 01:09:08,889
<i>Nobody makes a fool
of Scuttlebutt!</i>

995
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:11,991
Leave him be, you rat!
Hey, what the- Hey!

996
01:09:12,062 --> 01:09:13,917
Didn't your mother
ever tell ya?

997
01:09:13,982 --> 01:09:16,251
Kids shouldn't play
with fire.

998
01:09:16,316 --> 01:09:19,546
You might
get burned.

999
01:10:18,227 --> 01:10:20,082
Where's Philly?

1000
01:10:21,363 --> 01:10:23,731
Oh!

1001
01:10:25,746 --> 01:10:28,333
- Fievel?
- Philly?

1002
01:10:28,403 --> 01:10:30,443
Fievel!

1003
01:10:30,514 --> 01:10:33,198
<i>Fievel</i>

1004
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:41,708
Here!

1005
01:10:41,777 --> 01:10:43,565
Philly!

1006
01:10:43,631 --> 01:10:45,541
Oh, Fievel!

1007
01:10:50,063 --> 01:10:52,550
<i>I
Fellow mice-</i>

1008
01:10:52,622 --> 01:10:55,720
<i>Fellow Americans:</i>

1009
01:10:55,789 --> 01:10:58,954
I am honored
you should ask me...

1010
01:10:59,021 --> 01:11:02,697
to be your negotiator
with the factory owners.

1011
01:11:02,764 --> 01:11:04,739
Thank you.
All right!

1012
01:11:04,813 --> 01:11:08,294
<i>I hope that we and the
owners can work together...</i>

1013
01:11:08,365 --> 01:11:11,713
<i>to make a better
future for everyone.</i>

1014
01:11:11,787 --> 01:11:16,042
<i>Must we really make a deal with that riffraff?</i>

1015
01:11:16,106 --> 01:11:20,067
Well, if we don't, they all stay
out on strike, and we go broke.

1016
01:11:20,138 --> 01:11:23,487
Patience. We'll find a
way to regain control.

1017
01:11:23,562 --> 01:11:27,141
Remember, there are
lots of ways to skin a cat.

1018
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:29,097
<i>I beg your pardon?</i>

1019
01:11:29,161 --> 01:11:32,063
Uh, never mind. Eee! Move along.

1020
01:11:33,801 --> 01:11:36,517
Oh, I just love my new job!

1021
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:39,398
I also want
to thank you, Fievel.

1022
01:11:39,464 --> 01:11:42,661
<i>Me, Papa? Why?
Like I said.</i>

1023
01:11:42,727 --> 01:11:44,767
You are
my inspiration.

1024
01:11:44,839 --> 01:11:47,687
You reminded me
why we came to America.

1025
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:51,231
<i>You showed me how
the greatest treasure...</i>

1026
01:11:51,302 --> 01:11:53,604
<i>is not cheese
or money..</i>

1027
01:11:53,669 --> 01:11:55,579
<i>or even wampum.</i>

1028
01:11:55,653 --> 01:11:59,427
<i>No, the greatest treasure
is hope-</i>

1029
01:11:59,492 --> 01:12:01,466
enough hope
to have a dream,

1030
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:04,803
and a chance
to make it come true.

1031
01:12:06,787 --> 01:12:09,471
I wish Cholena
were here to see this.

1032
01:12:09,539 --> 01:12:11,961
Boy, me too.

1033
01:12:12,034 --> 01:12:14,686
I mean, yeah.
I mean-

1034
01:12:14,754 --> 01:12:16,728
Never mind, Tony.

1035
01:12:19,361 --> 01:12:24,096
Here, Fievel. A little gift
for my farsighted friend.

1036
01:12:24,161 --> 01:12:27,706
Really? Wow!
Thanks.

1037
01:12:27,776 --> 01:12:32,992
I think you’ll find the view most
interesting in that direction.

1038
01:12:38,814 --> 01:12:40,668
Huh?

1039
01:12:42,878 --> 01:12:44,853
<i>Wow!</i>
