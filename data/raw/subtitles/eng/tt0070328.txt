1
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,785
...was so ably pointed out
by the Secretary-General

2
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,995
in his opening remarks.

3
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,790
But - and I must emphasise this point -

4
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,712
no formula can, or will,
ever cover each case.

5
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:31,174
For instance...

6
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:39,015
...when three or more applicants
have been recognised,

7
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:44,229
which is in direct contradiction to...

8
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:55,383
Whose funeral is it?

9
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,678
Yours.

10
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,969
One more time again.

11
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:06,528
Not married, by any chance, are you?

12
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,291
Good morning, 007.

13
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:24,045
Good... good morning.

14
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,382
Insomnia, sir?

15
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,051
Instructions.

16
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:35,015
You haven't much time.
I'll explain as you pack.

17
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,850
Pack, sir?

18
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,728
Three agents have been killed
in the last 24 hours.

19
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:43,732
Dawes in New York, Hamilton in
New Orleans and Baines in the Caribbean.

20
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:48,611
Baines. I rather liked Baines.
We shared the same boot maker.

21
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,572
Coffee,

22
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,783
sir?

23
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,712
I take it these killings are connected?

24
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:10,383
That's precisely
what you're going to find out.

25
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:21,353
Baines was working on a small
Caribbean island called San Monique.

26
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:25,482
Dawes was in New York,
keeping an eye on its prime minister,

27
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:26,816
one Dr Kananga.

28
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:31,404
Hamilton was on loan to the Americans
in New Orleans.

29
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:38,453
Is that all it does?

30
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,622
By the way, congratulations.

31
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:44,751
The Italians were most impressed
by the way you handled the Rome affair.

32
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,544
Thank you, sir.

33
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,254
Sugar?

34
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:49,673
Thanks.

35
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:53,885
The authorities
were more than helpful.

36
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,805
There's one small complaint.

37
00:09:57,055 --> 00:10:00,183
They seem to be missing
one of their agents.

38
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:04,521
A Miss... Caruso.

39
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,859
You wouldn't happen to know
where she is?

40
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,569
Miss Moneypenny.

41
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,739
- Morning, Moneypenny.
- Good morning, sir.

42
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:18,368
- It's only the hour that's indecent.
- Really?

43
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:22,622
I've got your ticket to New York.
Q has repaired your wristwatch.

44
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:26,710
- And some background on San Monique.
- Thank you, Moneypenny.

45
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,047
I'm sure the overburdened British
taxpayer will be fascinated to know

46
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,342
will how the Special Ordnance Section
disburses its funds.

47
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:38,847
In future, Commander, may I suggest
a perfectly adequate watchmaker

48
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:42,600
just down the street.

49
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,185
Good God!

50
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:50,358
Pulling out this button turns the watch
into a hyper-intensified magnetic field,

51
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,194
powerful enough to deflect
the path of a bullet

52
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:59,909
- at long range - or so Q claims.
- I feel tempted to test that theory now.

53
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,746
If you don't mind, Commander, my spoon.

54
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,040
Sorry, sir.

55
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,249
Thank you.

56
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,752
Dr Kananga is at present in New York.

57
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:12,881
The CIA have been informed.
They are helping with surveillance.

58
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,300
Your flight arrives at 11.30am.

59
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,552
Now, where did I leave my coat?

60
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:21,389
Allow me.

61
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,272
Thank you.
Come along, Miss Moneypenny.

62
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,815
- Morning, Bond.
- Sir.

63
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,985
Miss Moneypenny.

64
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,862
Thank you.

65
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,449
Goodbye, James.

66
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:45,622
Or should I say... "ciao, bello"?

67
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:18,446
Such a delicate touch.

68
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:23,159
Sheer magnetism, darling.

69
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,669
A man comes.

70
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:38,008
He travels quickly.

71
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,345
He has purpose.

72
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,015
{Y:i}He comes over water.

73
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,018
{Y:i}He travels with others.

74
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,437
He will oppose.

75
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:54,649
He brings violence and destruction.

76
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,816
Hello.

77
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,778
- Mr Leiter for you, sir.
- Thank you.

78
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,405
Hello, Felix. How are you?

79
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,992
{Y:i}Traffic permitting,
I should be with you in half an hour.

80
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,037
{Y:i}Then you can buy me
the best lunch in New York.

81
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:52,499
Hi, James. Your friend Kananga
has just left the UN.

82
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:55,168
He's probably headed back
to his embassy.

83
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:59,673
No, don't worry. The place is eyeballed,
wired for sound - the works.

84
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:03,635
Right. I'll see you in a half-hour.

85
00:14:56,312 --> 00:15:00,734
Easy, Charlie.
Let's get there in one piece.

86
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,945
Charlie?

87
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:48,198
Right, stand by.

88
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:52,994
Here comes Kananga's limousine.

89
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,832
Out he gets

90
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,001
with the usual goon squad

91
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,170
and the girl.

92
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,340
Time: 11.46.

93
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:09,260
What is that?!

94
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:18,353
Felix? You know I hate to trouble you,
but I've run into a little bother.

95
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,942
You what?!

96
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:29,322
Get me a make on a white pimpmobile.

97
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,783
3-4-7. Nelson David George.

98
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:35,787
{Y:i}It would seem, Dr Kananga,
that the conference has not

99
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,622
lived up to your expectations.

100
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,500
We can only hope that
this is a temporary setback.

101
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,504
However, I do have
some observations to make.

102
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,172
Take a letter, please.

103
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:51,386
To Secretary-General,
Pan-lsland Unity Conference.

104
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:54,681
Sir...

105
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:59,310
I wish to point out...

106
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:00,645
that...

107
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,773
{Y:i}too many
of our island neighbours

108
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:08,486
{Y:i}have once again let themselves be...
bullied by United States industry.

109
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:10,780
{Y:i}The story is an old one,

110
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,199
{Y:i}the record a clear one.

111
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,703
{Y:i}Since my historic statement of principles

112
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:20,415
{Y:i}was delivered and acted upon
some six months ago,

113
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:24,252
{Y:i}our economic outlook
has improved dramatically.

114
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:29,549
{Y:i}By exercising our policy of friendship
to all with favouritism towards none,

115
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,053
{Y:i}new respect for the entire area
has been injected.

116
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:34,971
{Y:i}And even though some of my...

117
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:39,059
James? That car is registered
to a shop at 33 East 65th Street.

118
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,227
That's only a block away from here.

119
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:45,148
Right. Take your time, buddy.
Kananga's knitting a flag in there.

120
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:49,402
{Y:i}It might be the easiest thing to do.

121
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,845
Something... in heads?

122
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:20,016
Just browsing, thank you.

123
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,416
Five dollars.

124
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,752
Do you think you could
giftwrap it for me, please?

125
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:50,005
Lengthwise, if you don't mind.

126
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:53,508
Thank you.

127
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:17,032
{Y:i}... remains my first concern.

128
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:21,661
{Y:i}Thus San Monique's obligations to
her island neighbours would seem clear.

129
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,998
{Y:i}Those who fawn and crawl
in the face of intimidation

130
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:28,460
{Y:i}must perforce look up
to those who stand, proudly,

131
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,171
{Y:i}wrapped in a justifiable self-confidence.

132
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:35,550
{Y:i}The time has come,
painful as it may be,

133
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:42,098
{Y:i}to gaze out among our sister nations
in the area and see if any stands...

134
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,487
He's tailing.

135
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:44,411
I got him in my sights.

136
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:59,509
- You know where you're goin', man?
- Uptown, I believe.

137
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,263
Uptown? We headin' into Harlem, man.

138
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:07,183
Just keep on the tail of that jukebox
and there's an extra $20 for you.

139
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:14,024
Man, for 20 bucks,
I'd take you to a Ku Klux Klan cookout.

140
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:34,210
125th. You got a honky on your tail.

141
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:48,683
He's heading east.

142
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:52,979
Can't miss him.
It's like following a cue ball.

143
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,235
That's the car.
They must have gone inside.

144
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:03,073
Pull up where you can.

145
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,330
Sure hope you make friends easy.

146
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,292
Right on, brother.

147
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:19,589
He's headin' on in!

148
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,864
Good afternoon.

149
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:49,536
- Bourbon and water, please.
- The first booth will do.

150
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,746
Tell him neat, would you?

151
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:56,209
- No ice.
- That's extra, man.

152
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:13,435
I'd like something on the side as well.

153
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:15,311
Information.

154
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:19,149
Three men and a girl came in...

155
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:25,363
Relax, baby.

156
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:29,909
Mr Big's gonna take care of you
in a minute.

157
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:54,100
Black queen on the red king, Miss...?

158
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:55,602
Solitaire.

159
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:59,314
My name's Bond.

160
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:00,857
James Bond.

161
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:02,484
I know who you are,

162
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:05,570
what you are, and why you've come.

163
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,322
You've made a mistake.

164
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:10,033
You will not succeed.

165
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:14,120
Rather a sweeping statement,
considering we've never met.

166
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:16,414
The cards have followed you for me.

167
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:22,879
You get ripped off in Detroit,
you yell out to me! D'you hear?

168
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:29,135
Is he armed?

169
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:34,099
You can't be too careful in New York City.

170
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:01,334
Funny how the least little thing
amuses him.

171
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:07,882
Fascinating.

172
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:11,720
That's you, quite obviously.
An amazing resemblance.

173
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,140
Am I in there as well?

174
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,518
Pick a card.

175
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:23,523
Turn it over.

176
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:27,527
You have found yourself.

177
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:31,197
I'm telling you,
go out to LA and clean it up

178
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:35,452
or I'm coming out there
and clean "you" up. And I mean that!

179
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:38,329
Is this the stupid mother
that tailed you uptown?

180
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,666
There seems to be some mistake.
My name...

181
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:43,835
Names is for tombstones, baby.

182
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:48,548
Y'all take this honky out
and waste him - now!

183
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:54,971
- "Waste him"? Is that a good thing?
- The reading is over.

184
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:58,808
Nothing about my future?

185
00:26:05,857 --> 00:26:08,860
Us?

186
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:16,451
Now, promise you'll stay right there.
I shan't be long.

187
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:27,420
Thank you.

188
00:26:43,895 --> 00:26:45,772
Keep your hands up, honky.

189
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:50,568
What's he think this is?
Blow his friggin' head off.

190
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:04,457
Drop it!

191
00:27:07,752 --> 00:27:10,964
Now.

192
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:20,682
Harold Strutter, CIA. Where were you
when I didn't need you?

193
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:23,351
It got obvious
you weren't coming out front.

194
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:26,563
Not even with that clever disguise
you were wearing.

195
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:28,732
A white face in Harlem.

196
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:33,236
Good thinking, Bond.
Let's get outta here.

197
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:37,657
I'm surprised they didn't spot you.

198
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:41,161
There's a remarkable girl back there
with a deck of cards.

199
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:45,206
I saw those cards on the way up.
Spades, James. Every one.

200
00:27:45,457 --> 00:27:47,709
You were nailed the minute you left 74.

201
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:51,546
Only one man can pull together
that much black muscle in this town.

202
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:53,506
Calls himself Mr Big.

203
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:59,012
You name the business.
They say he has a black concession.

204
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,227
What would a foreign prime minister
like Kananga

205
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:08,396
want with an American gangster?

206
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:12,317
Question is, what would Mr Big
want with a two-bit island diplomat?

207
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:18,948
{Y:i}Mr Big? Where the hell
does "he" fit into this mess?

208
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,787
A genuine Felix lighter. Illuminating.

209
00:28:24,037 --> 00:28:25,663
{Y:i}Now listen, James,

210
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:30,710
Kananga's got a private plane and he's
leaving for San Monique within the hour.

211
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,422
{Y:i}- Get me on the next available flight.
- I already did.

212
00:28:34,673 --> 00:28:40,887
I knew you wouldn't pass up a chance
to get away from where the "real" action is.

213
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:52,524
The legendary Baron Samedi, folks.

214
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:55,318
That's Saturday,
for those who speak French.

215
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:58,863
Voodoo god of cemeteries
and chief of the legion of the dead.

216
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:02,450
The man who cannot die.
But, for our purposes,

217
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:06,913
just a performer in a musical
extravaganza we've cooked up

218
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:10,750
for you wonderful people.

219
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:24,431
Good evening. The name's Bond.
I have a reservation.

220
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:29,978
Mr Bond. Of course.
Mrs Bond's been expecting you.

221
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:33,565
- Mrs Bond?
- She arrived earlier this afternoon.

222
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:37,736
Said she preferred
something a little more... private.

223
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:38,945
Bungalow 12.

224
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:43,324
An incurable romantic - Mrs Bond.

225
00:31:36,187 --> 00:31:39,774
Room service, please.

226
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:44,404
Room service?
This is Mr Bond. Bungalow 12.

227
00:31:44,654 --> 00:31:50,326
I'd like a bottle of Bollinger, please.
Slightly chilled.

228
00:31:51,703 --> 00:31:55,665
Two glasses. Thank you.

229
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:08,571
Anybody home?

230
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:16,079
Your champagne, sir.

231
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:18,456
- What was that?
- Your champagne.

232
00:33:18,707 --> 00:33:22,502
Put it on the table, thanks.

233
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:28,842
- Shall I open it?
- What?

234
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:31,428
Shall I open it?

235
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:35,807
Oh, no. I can manage. Thank you.

236
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:40,812
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

237
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:09,693
Mrs Bond, I presume?

238
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:13,613
I'm Rosie Carver.

239
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:19,661
I guess I have a little explaining to do.

240
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:26,376
Yes. Either you or

241
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:30,422
dear Uncle Felix.

242
00:35:30,505 --> 00:35:33,091
Custom 38, Smith & Wesson.

243
00:35:33,341 --> 00:35:37,762
Corrugated three-inch stock,
no serial number, standard CIA issue.

244
00:35:38,013 --> 00:35:41,266
The question is: Why point it at me?

245
00:35:41,516 --> 00:35:45,562
The man who delivered your champagne
is not a hotel waiter.

246
00:35:45,812 --> 00:35:47,647
I was just trying to be careful.

247
00:35:47,897 --> 00:35:50,692
As for Felix Leiter, you're right.

248
00:35:50,942 --> 00:35:53,570
I've worked for CIA down here
for some time now.

249
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,615
He cabled me you were coming
and asked if I would help out if I could.

250
00:35:57,866 --> 00:36:02,996
Perhaps you'd better start
by getting your head together.

251
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:07,625
- There's a mirror in the bathroom.
- Yes.

252
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:10,462
You're only my second mission,
you know.

253
00:36:10,712 --> 00:36:14,382
My first was Baines.
The agent who was killed.

254
00:36:14,632 --> 00:36:19,929
It's a relief to know I'm next in line
for the same kind of aid.

255
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:29,022
- There's a...
- A snake! I should have told you.

256
00:36:29,272 --> 00:36:32,233
You should never go in there
without a mongoose.

257
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:35,403
I should have never
gotten into any of this!

258
00:36:35,653 --> 00:36:38,448
I'm going to be completely useless to you.

259
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:42,494
I'm sure we'll be able
to lick you into shape.

260
00:36:42,744 --> 00:36:45,872
It's... getting late, Mrs Bond.

261
00:36:46,122 --> 00:36:48,041
Tomorrow will be a very busy day.

262
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:51,419
You see, Kananga is
protecting something down here.

263
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,714
Something which Baines
obviously discovered.

264
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:59,135
You're going to show me the spot
where Baines' body was found.

265
00:36:59,386 --> 00:37:03,640
That, I'm afraid,
only leaves us tonight to...

266
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,559
catch up on old times.

267
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:10,647
Felix told me there'd be
moments like this.

268
00:37:10,897 --> 00:37:14,484
What did good old Felix suggest?

269
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:16,444
If all else failed,

270
00:37:16,695 --> 00:37:20,073
cyanide pills.

271
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:24,786
I settled for two bedrooms.

272
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,039
Good night, Mr Bond.

273
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:32,002
Mrs Bond.

274
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:45,807
It's just a hat, darling,

275
00:37:46,057 --> 00:37:49,853
belonging to a small-headed man
who lost a fight with a chicken.

276
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:54,399
It's a warning. Get it outta here!

277
00:37:54,733 --> 00:37:56,609
Oh, please!

278
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,571
Please don't leave me alone tonight.

279
00:37:59,821 --> 00:38:04,200
James, please promise me!

280
00:38:04,993 --> 00:38:10,123
All right, darling,
if you insist... I promise.

281
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:17,422
Thank you.

282
00:38:17,672 --> 00:38:20,008
Rosie!

283
00:38:20,258 --> 00:38:23,845
Breakfast's up!

284
00:38:43,782 --> 00:38:45,033
Rosie!

285
00:38:45,283 --> 00:38:47,619
- Are you ready yet?
- What?

286
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:51,456
I have to see about organising a car.

287
00:38:51,706 --> 00:38:55,794
I'll see you in the lobby.

288
00:39:06,596 --> 00:39:10,600
Over here, sir!
Guarantee big fish. Catch big fish, sir!

289
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,769
Hey, baby! Over here!

290
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:15,939
Bring your man over here!
Just $20! Have a date!

291
00:39:16,189 --> 00:39:19,067
You got warm lady?
We got cold beer over here, man.

292
00:39:19,317 --> 00:39:24,406
You wanna catch a big fish, sir?
It's only £2 over here.

293
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:28,910
Good morning.

294
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,456
Come on, Rosie.
This one seems eager enough.

295
00:39:39,254 --> 00:39:40,755
Excuse me!

296
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:44,676
Where can I change?

297
00:39:46,011 --> 00:39:50,765
Me... clothes off... where?

298
00:40:30,388 --> 00:40:33,350
Stop right there.

299
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,187
Turn around slowly.

300
00:40:37,479 --> 00:40:40,732
Keep your hands up!

301
00:40:40,982 --> 00:40:43,193
As I was saying, Quarrel, a lousy agent.

302
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:45,987
But the compensations
speak for themselves.

303
00:40:46,237 --> 00:40:49,532
Rosie Carver, meet the man
who shares my hairbrush.

304
00:40:49,783 --> 00:40:51,868
Quarrel Junior.

305
00:40:52,118 --> 00:40:56,122
I'm really sorry. I could have shot you.

306
00:40:56,373 --> 00:41:02,045
You might have even killed me
if you'd taken off the safety catch.

307
00:41:07,884 --> 00:41:09,386
Never mind, darling.

308
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:15,350
You just let us know when we get
to the spot where Baines was killed.

309
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:21,773
It's up in the hills,
just after we clear the next cove.

310
00:41:30,615 --> 00:41:34,285
Hey, Quarrel!
Who the hell lives up there?

311
00:41:34,536 --> 00:41:37,038
That's the house of the Kananga woman.

312
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:39,958
She's supposed to have
the power of the obeah.

313
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:45,171
No one on the island
dare go up there except him.

314
00:41:50,385 --> 00:41:52,095
He comes again.

315
00:41:52,345 --> 00:41:55,306
{Y:i}There will be violence.

316
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:57,559
{Y:i}He approaches even now.

317
00:41:57,809 --> 00:41:59,269
By land or water?

318
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:02,605
Water.

319
00:42:11,072 --> 00:42:13,450
He has arrived.

320
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,784
Good.

321
00:42:15,035 --> 00:42:18,788
Rosie's been more efficient
than I anticipated.

322
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:21,374
I know where
we could rustle up a car.

323
00:42:21,624 --> 00:42:24,502
Beautiful, brave, and now resourceful.

324
00:42:24,753 --> 00:42:29,674
Rosie, you seem to be staging
a remarkable comeback.

325
00:42:29,841 --> 00:42:32,802
Tell me about the future.

326
00:42:44,898 --> 00:42:47,859
Is it death?

327
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:50,779
{Y:i}I said, is it death?

328
00:42:51,029 --> 00:42:54,240
It is death.

329
00:42:57,077 --> 00:42:59,204
They're coming.

330
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:01,373
Rosie knows what to do.

331
00:43:01,623 --> 00:43:06,336
Now, I want no bodies this time. No trace.

332
00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:11,800
It's down there.

333
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:17,722
But... I thought you said
Baines was killed up in the hills, darling.

334
00:43:18,723 --> 00:43:22,060
Up in the hills, down there.

335
00:43:22,394 --> 00:43:26,189
Why don't we have a bite of lunch
and discuss it?

336
00:43:26,439 --> 00:43:29,609
There's an excellent pâté in the hamper.

337
00:43:29,859 --> 00:43:31,528
I'm in no hurry.

338
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:35,115
Are you?

339
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:38,910
No.

340
00:44:00,015 --> 00:44:01,933
James!

341
00:44:02,183 --> 00:44:05,895
You don't know
what finding you has meant to me.

342
00:44:06,146 --> 00:44:07,689
I can imagine.

343
00:44:07,939 --> 00:44:11,901
And you've no idea
what finding this has meant to me.

344
00:44:12,152 --> 00:44:16,114
You do know what the Queen of Cups
means in an upside-down position?

345
00:44:16,364 --> 00:44:19,617
A deceitful, perverse woman.
A liar, a cheat.

346
00:44:19,868 --> 00:44:21,995
And I'd like some answers now.

347
00:44:22,245 --> 00:44:24,080
Please...

348
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:27,542
You don't understand, sir.
They'll kill me if I do.

349
00:44:27,792 --> 00:44:31,755
And I'll kill you if you don't.

350
00:44:32,589 --> 00:44:37,177
But you couldn't. You wouldn't.
Not after what we've just done.

351
00:44:37,427 --> 00:44:41,890
I certainly wouldn't
have killed you before.

352
00:44:51,858 --> 00:44:56,237
It used to be a convincing act, Rosie.
It's wearing a little thin now.

353
00:44:56,488 --> 00:44:59,783
It's not an act. It's...

354
00:45:00,033 --> 00:45:03,620
Make your choice.

355
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:14,798
Rosie!

356
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:53,253
You will explain what went wrong.

357
00:45:54,629 --> 00:45:56,631
I see the intervention of a woman.

358
00:45:56,881 --> 00:46:02,554
The girl was about to confess.
We had to kill her.

359
00:46:03,096 --> 00:46:06,266
The trap was set.

360
00:46:06,516 --> 00:46:09,811
Tee Hee was waiting.

361
00:46:10,061 --> 00:46:11,980
And you saw death.

362
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:15,817
It must have been the girl's death.

363
00:46:16,067 --> 00:46:18,611
If you do not ask specific questions,

364
00:46:18,862 --> 00:46:24,617
I cannot be responsible for your
misinterpretation of the answers.

365
00:46:24,868 --> 00:46:28,997
These growing signs of impertinence
begin to disturb me, Solitaire.

366
00:46:29,247 --> 00:46:31,624
As they did with your mother before you.

367
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:34,961
She had the power and lost it.
Became useless to me.

368
00:46:35,211 --> 00:46:37,797
You will not make the same mistake,

369
00:46:38,048 --> 00:46:41,634
Solitaire.

370
00:46:43,011 --> 00:46:46,097
Where is Bond now?

371
00:47:08,328 --> 00:47:11,498
Where is Bond now?!

372
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:17,253
I cannot see
when you are this way with me.

373
00:47:17,337 --> 00:47:19,339
Things become unclear.

374
00:47:19,589 --> 00:47:23,259
Let us hope these momentary lapses
do not become a habit.

375
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:27,681
Your power exists to serve me.
And it is mine to control.

376
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:35,063
If and when the time comes I decide you
are to lose it, I myself will take it away.

377
00:47:39,734 --> 00:47:44,823
Solitaire, go to sleep. You have made me
angry with you, and I have no wish to be.

378
00:47:45,073 --> 00:47:48,118
Tee Hee...

379
00:49:05,236 --> 00:49:09,908
Put down those cards!

380
00:49:10,617 --> 00:49:13,244
It is a blasphemy!

381
00:49:13,495 --> 00:49:16,039
They tell nothing
to those who cannot see.

382
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:19,167
But they do. That's a... a bit of luck.

383
00:49:19,417 --> 00:49:21,252
Good luck, for both of us.

384
00:49:21,503 --> 00:49:26,216
The cards say we will be lovers.

385
00:49:28,551 --> 00:49:30,553
You are mistaken.

386
00:49:30,804 --> 00:49:34,099
It's impossible. Forbidden for me.

387
00:49:34,349 --> 00:49:36,184
Now you must go.

388
00:49:36,434 --> 00:49:39,479
But you do believe...

389
00:49:39,729 --> 00:49:43,566
I mean really "believe" in the cards?

390
00:49:43,817 --> 00:49:47,112
They have never lied to me.

391
00:49:47,362 --> 00:49:51,324
Then they won't now.

392
00:49:53,702 --> 00:49:56,663
Pick one.

393
00:50:23,523 --> 00:50:27,652
You knew the answer before it was given.

394
00:50:29,195 --> 00:50:31,823
Strangely enough, somehow...

395
00:50:32,073 --> 00:50:35,243
so did I.

396
00:51:08,193 --> 00:51:11,863
So it's finally happened.

397
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:17,911
Just as it did to my mother...
and her mother before her.

398
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:21,581
Of course it did.

399
00:51:21,831 --> 00:51:26,670
You're visual proof of that, aren't you?

400
00:51:28,797 --> 00:51:31,925
Come on, cheer up, darling.

401
00:51:32,175 --> 00:51:36,471
There has to be a first time for everyone.

402
00:51:36,638 --> 00:51:38,473
Now tell me,

403
00:51:38,723 --> 00:51:42,310
where's Kananga?

404
00:51:42,477 --> 00:51:46,064
I cannot see.

405
00:51:47,565 --> 00:51:51,736
- Oh, yes, the cards. I'll get them.
- No!

406
00:51:51,986 --> 00:51:54,864
There's no need to be frightened.

407
00:51:55,115 --> 00:51:58,535
You'll soon be rid of him, I promise.

408
00:51:58,785 --> 00:52:01,913
I promise.

409
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,165
I just need a

410
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:09,045
little bit of information, that's all.

411
00:52:09,129 --> 00:52:12,340
The power...

412
00:52:12,507 --> 00:52:15,760
I've lost it.

413
00:52:17,137 --> 00:52:23,309
The High Priestess is wife
to the Prince no longer of this world.

414
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:28,606
The spiritual bridge to the secret church.

415
00:52:29,607 --> 00:52:31,609
It was my fate.

416
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:34,654
By compelling me to earthly love,

417
00:52:34,904 --> 00:52:40,201
the cards themselves
have taken away my powers.

418
00:52:41,619 --> 00:52:43,538
Darling, I've...

419
00:52:43,788 --> 00:52:45,707
a small confession to make.

420
00:52:45,957 --> 00:52:49,878
Now, try not to be too upset.

421
00:52:50,045 --> 00:52:53,340
The deck was slightly stacked
in my favour.

422
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:55,717
It makes no difference.

423
00:52:55,967 --> 00:53:01,264
The physical violation cannot be undone.

424
00:53:01,848 --> 00:53:05,935
When he finds out I've lost my power...

425
00:53:05,977 --> 00:53:07,604
he'll kill me.

426
00:53:07,854 --> 00:53:10,815
Oh, now, come on.
He'll have to find you first.

427
00:53:11,066 --> 00:53:14,903
Lovers' lesson number one:
We have no secrets.

428
00:53:15,153 --> 00:53:17,614
For example, I have a boat waiting.

429
00:53:17,864 --> 00:53:20,617
You can be on it.

430
00:53:20,867 --> 00:53:28,041
All I have to know before we leave is...
what goes on back there in voodoo land.

431
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,587
Darling, three men and a girl
have been killed in the last four days.

432
00:53:32,837 --> 00:53:35,382
Not counting the times
they've tried to stop me

433
00:53:35,632 --> 00:53:38,259
from discovering
what Kananga's protecting.

434
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:40,679
Now, do you want to be
on that boat or not?

435
00:53:40,929 --> 00:53:43,682
I simply read the cards for him.

436
00:53:43,932 --> 00:53:46,101
I have never been there,

437
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:50,271
and he's never taken me there.

438
00:53:59,197 --> 00:54:01,074
I've never dared to go.

439
00:54:01,324 --> 00:54:03,576
But I've looked in the cards.

440
00:54:03,827 --> 00:54:07,580
I've seen great riches there.

441
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:10,709
They'll kill you.

442
00:54:10,959 --> 00:54:12,961
Us, darling.

443
00:54:13,211 --> 00:54:15,171
They will kill "us".

444
00:54:15,422 --> 00:54:18,842
Lovers' lesson number two: Togetherness.

445
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:22,345
Till death do us part, or thereabouts.

446
00:54:22,595 --> 00:54:25,306
Is there time before we leave

447
00:54:25,557 --> 00:54:29,144
for lesson number three?

448
00:54:33,523 --> 00:54:34,983
Absolutely.

449
00:54:35,233 --> 00:54:39,654
There's no sense in going off half-cocked.

450
00:54:51,875 --> 00:54:54,419
- This way.
- How can you be so sure?

451
00:54:54,669 --> 00:54:58,590
These scarecrows are to scare
"people" away. You're not scared, are you?

452
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:03,011
Lesson number four:
Follow the scarecrows.

453
00:55:36,795 --> 00:55:38,922
- Good morning, boss.
- Morning.

454
00:55:39,172 --> 00:55:43,843
It's sure gonna be a "beautiful" day.

455
00:55:44,094 --> 00:55:48,807
Yes, sir, a "beautiful" day!

456
00:55:58,608 --> 00:56:02,612
They're heading for the hill.

457
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:06,533
They're here.

458
00:56:09,077 --> 00:56:12,747
If he finds it, kill him.

459
00:57:15,977 --> 00:57:19,064
Quick!

460
00:57:28,323 --> 00:57:33,078
We've lost him. He has the girl.

461
00:57:41,336 --> 00:57:45,715
They're somewhere under the nets.

462
00:57:49,719 --> 00:57:55,558
At any cost - any - Bond must die.

463
00:58:13,993 --> 00:58:17,956
Unit 2-5. We have picked them up.

464
00:58:25,672 --> 00:58:30,969
{Y:i}Base to 2-5. Arrest Bond.
But I repeat, the girl is not to be touched.

465
00:58:31,219 --> 00:58:34,222
Message received and understood.
Over and out.

466
00:58:34,472 --> 00:58:40,854
{Y:i}Base to all units.
I repeat, the girl is not to be touched.

467
01:00:15,073 --> 01:00:18,660
Get out of the way!

468
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,719
Sweet mother of pearl!

469
01:01:17,969 --> 01:01:20,638
All change! End of the line!

470
01:01:20,889 --> 01:01:22,390
Get down below, quickly!

471
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:26,644
Here, I'll do that. You get her started.

472
01:01:34,027 --> 01:01:36,988
{Y:i}It appears... a bus.

473
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,871
James!

474
01:01:45,121 --> 01:01:48,083
He'll be looking for me now.
I know he'll never stop.

475
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:50,377
Come on, darling.

476
01:01:50,627 --> 01:01:54,005
It's all over.

477
01:01:54,964 --> 01:01:57,509
Voodoo land was just poppy fields.

478
01:01:57,759 --> 01:02:00,095
A simple matter of heroin smuggling.

479
01:02:00,345 --> 01:02:02,847
I'll have a word with a man named Felix,

480
01:02:03,098 --> 01:02:05,642
turn the case over to him,
and you and I will be off.

481
01:02:05,892 --> 01:02:10,188
By the way, where would you like to go?

482
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:14,943
Anywhere where we can find
one of these.

483
01:02:24,202 --> 01:02:26,246
How quickly can we make it
to New Orleans?

484
01:02:26,496 --> 01:02:28,415
Santa Mina, four hours away...

485
01:02:28,665 --> 01:02:31,501
You could catch a flight
and be there in the morning.

486
01:02:31,751 --> 01:02:36,673
Get in touch with Felix. Tell him to meet
me there tomorrow. Royal Orleans Hotel.

487
01:02:36,923 --> 01:02:38,591
Tampa is closer.

488
01:02:38,842 --> 01:02:43,179
Hamilton was killed in New Orleans,
so there has to be a connection.

489
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:47,058
And this is a valuable piece
of merchandise we're carrying.

490
01:02:47,308 --> 01:02:51,354
Which, with any luck, they'll want back.

491
01:03:03,783 --> 01:03:07,620
Royal Orleans Hotel, please.

492
01:03:19,257 --> 01:03:21,676
Are you sure this is the way
to New Orleans?

493
01:03:21,926 --> 01:03:27,974
I don't know, but this sure
beats the hell out of Harlem, don't it?

494
01:03:31,144 --> 01:03:33,063
Well, hello, Jim!

495
01:03:33,313 --> 01:03:37,025
What's happenin', baby?

496
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:42,155
Just ease back now, Jim. Relax!

497
01:03:42,405 --> 01:03:46,368
Mr Big wants to see you.

498
01:04:10,141 --> 01:04:12,811
You made a mistake
back on that island, Bond.

499
01:04:13,061 --> 01:04:17,273
You took something that didn't belong
to you, from a friend of Mr Big's.

500
01:04:17,524 --> 01:04:22,696
That type of mistake
is tough to bounce back from.

501
01:04:23,363 --> 01:04:26,700
- But I've only just arrived.
- Today is your lucky day, Jim!

502
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:28,451
You're going skydiving!

503
01:04:28,702 --> 01:04:32,205
There's a helluva view of the lake
from 10,000 feet.

504
01:04:32,455 --> 01:04:36,876
My only regret is I won't be there to see it.

505
01:04:42,257 --> 01:04:45,218
Let's go!

506
01:05:00,025 --> 01:05:01,943
- Good morning. You're...
- Mrs Bell.

507
01:05:02,193 --> 01:05:04,821
You're not my instructor.
Where's Mr Bleeker?

508
01:05:05,071 --> 01:05:09,242
Indisposed. I'll be giving the lesson.

509
01:05:14,622 --> 01:05:15,999
What's on for today?

510
01:05:16,249 --> 01:05:20,170
Let's just wing it, shall we, Mrs Bell?

511
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:55,080
You're over-revving.

512
01:05:59,084 --> 01:06:02,504
- Leroy, slow down, for Pete's sake!
- Do what the man say!

513
01:06:02,754 --> 01:06:06,341
I can't... I can't find the brake!

514
01:06:15,892 --> 01:06:19,604
Close those doors!

515
01:06:21,064 --> 01:06:24,192
Holy shit!

516
01:06:41,292 --> 01:06:44,963
OK, Don. Don't worry,
I'll take care of it. Right.

517
01:06:45,213 --> 01:06:49,801
Talk to you later.
I've got to go and give a lesson.

518
01:06:53,388 --> 01:06:56,641
Same time tomorrow, Mrs Bell?

519
01:06:56,891 --> 01:06:58,685
Yes, Mr Bleeker.

520
01:06:58,935 --> 01:07:03,148
Yes, sir. I know you just can't
glue the wings back on.

521
01:07:03,398 --> 01:07:07,110
Now, Mr Bleeker, I'm sure
there's no reason for name-calling.

522
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:10,238
That's fine. Don't forget the double vents.

523
01:07:10,488 --> 01:07:13,324
I appreciate she's one of your best pupils.

524
01:07:13,575 --> 01:07:16,369
That's a little frantic.
I'll keep the other three.

525
01:07:16,619 --> 01:07:19,914
Any such suggestion
should be put in writing to Washington.

526
01:07:20,165 --> 01:07:23,460
- How is Mrs Bell?
- Intensive care, but she'll pull through.

527
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:26,671
Yes, sir.
No one's questioning your patriotism.

528
01:07:26,921 --> 01:07:28,840
I'm sure you're a veteran, sir.

529
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:32,552
Felix, find out if there's
a Fillet Of Soul restaurant in town.

530
01:07:32,802 --> 01:07:38,600
We're way ahead of you. It's on
Docker Street. Strutter's watching it now.
