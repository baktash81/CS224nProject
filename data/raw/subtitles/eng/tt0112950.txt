1
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,489
Write slip twice. Put money in the bag.

2
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,574
Joe?

3
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:16,910
Gina.

4
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,081
Lucas, what are you doing in here?

5
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,501
My life has reached its pinnacle.

6
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,923
Joe's letting me close the store tonight.

7
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,425
- You're kidding.
- I am not.

8
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,302
Big responsibility, Lucas.

9
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,303
Yes.

10
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,847
But Joe's rules are extremely simple:

11
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,808
Count money twice...

12
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,060
keep my hands off of his beer...

13
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,728
cigars...

14
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,021
and drumsticks.

15
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,149
My, my, how will you remember it all?

16
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,151
Good luck.

17
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,736
Don't screw it up.

18
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,660
A responsibility like this
requires the obedience...

19
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,328
of a saint.

20
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,063
- Hi.
- No.

21
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,774
- We're closed.
- I know. Just one thing.

22
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,609
Guess what time it is?

23
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,695
- We close at midnight.
- Don't send me away.

24
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,113
I know, please.

25
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,914
You're an angel.

26
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,918
I couldn't look at Letterman's face
for another second.

27
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,295
- Ma'am.
- I'm just...

28
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,547
Never marry a tow truck driver.

29
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:53,381
Okay.

30
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:56,593
I mean, you know,
going out on calls is one thing...

31
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,387
but cruising for accidents every night,
I mean...

32
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:00,930
- Am I wrong?
- Ma'am.

33
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,099
Well, towing is a competitive field.

34
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:06,061
Family is also very important.
These are complex issues...

35
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,480
You know, I studied dance for 11 years.

36
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,399
- Really?
- I auditioned for Cats.

37
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:12,859
No shit.

38
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,238
I love this.

39
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,741
Did you ever hear it on vinyl?

40
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,326
You should hear it on vinyl.

41
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:24,371
It's a lot better.
You should check it out. We have it.

42
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,413
Yeah?

43
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,458
You know, many people say that...

44
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,335
it doesn't make a difference...

45
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:33,296
but I say that
it's the difference that makes it.

46
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,925
Do you think this story is already written?

47
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,805
Or do you think a bold and courageous act
can change the course of history?

48
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:28,435
"Music Town
franchise option agreement"?

49
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,203
They've got to be kidding.

50
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,583
In the immortal words of The Doors:

51
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,670
"The time to hesitate is through."

52
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,624
Twenty-two.

53
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,710
Twenty-two black.

54
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,963
Who was that guy?

55
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,925
Craps! End of roll! New roller!

56
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,263
Place your bets, please.
Get your bets down.

57
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,974
We have a high roller.

58
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,519
$9,104. I counted it. Twice.

59
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,980
I like your style.

60
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,108
Joe told me to count it twice.

61
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,194
No more bets, please. Put your bets down.

62
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,573
Do I just throw it and get a seven?

63
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,325
- That would be very good, sir.
- Feeling lucky?

64
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,953
I'm guided by a force
much greater than luck.

65
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:53,788
Seven!

66
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:54,956
A winner!

67
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:58,209
- Baby, you are sex!
- I know.

68
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,337
Same lucky shooter.

69
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,255
Get your bets down.

70
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,633
- Hot shooter on the line.
- You know what? Let it ride.

71
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,971
Hot dice coming out.

72
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:13,475
That's an $18,000 bet.
Sure you know what you're doing, kid?

73
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,644
I know this: That if I win this roll...

74
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,481
I will save the place that I work
from being sold...

75
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,025
and the jobs of my friends that work there.

76
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,778
Thus striking a blow at all that is evil...

77
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,572
and making this world
a better place to live in.

78
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:28,740
What?

79
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,494
And I'll...

80
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,620
buy you guys a drink.

81
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,330
Party! Okay!

82
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,248
Get your bets down.

83
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,500
Joe...

84
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,627
this one's for you.

85
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:44,172
Two.

86
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,882
- Craps.
- End of roll.

87
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,343
You know something?
You used to be cute.

88
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,262
And you used to have $9,000.

89
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,560
I wonder if I'll be held responsible for this.

90
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,198
What the hell are you doing here, man?

91
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,827
Something happened to me last night
in Atlantic City.

92
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,870
You went to Atlantic City?

93
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,039
Did you win anything?

94
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,667
No. I did not win.

95
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,546
So, if you guys ever wonder
if it was nice to know you...

96
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,840
I tell you, now, that it was.

97
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,592
Shit, man, what happened?

98
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:31,720
What happened?

99
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:35,724
I do not regret the things I've done,
but those I did not do.

100
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,059
Lucas, how much?

101
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:39,894
How much?

102
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,190
Shit.

103
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,777
What do you mean by "shit"? What's up?

104
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:53,742
Lucas doesn't have any money,
and Joe let him close the store last night.

105
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,118
Yeah? So?

106
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,207
I guess he didn't live up
to his responsibility, did he?

107
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,586
No, not the full responsibility. Shut up.

108
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,629
What's up, Joe?

109
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,343
What's up with the boss threads, man?

110
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:15,013
- Frigging Rex Manning Day.
- What's up with the hostility?

111
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:30,820
Phone.

112
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:34,157
Right. Empire Records,
open till midnight. This is Mark.

113
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,119
It's the bank.

114
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,749
Yeah, it's Joe.

115
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,126
Are you sure?

116
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,545
It should be.

117
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,923
Empire Records, open till midnight.
This is Mark.

118
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,758
I don't know. I'll have to check.

119
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,135
- It's the boss.
- Give me a sec, please.

120
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:59,599
Yeah, Mitch. Will you stop yelling, please?

121
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,017
What's wrong?

122
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,478
What is it?

123
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,272
Lucas? No way. Come on.

124
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:08,817
Here he comes.

125
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:33,008
Damn it, Lucas!

126
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,849
What's the matter?

127
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,897
- Surprise!
- What is it?

128
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,524
Happy Rex Manning Day.

129
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,235
When did you have time to make these?

130
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,321
Dad says there are 24 usable hours
in every day. Thank you.

131
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:58,783
You absolutely amaze me. You are a nerd.

132
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,076
That's me.

133
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,331
- So?
- So.

134
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,584
So today...

135
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:11,671
- I will offer myself to Rex Manning.
- All right!

136
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:14,674
I love you.

137
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,384
Like this.

138
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,095
Get your tongue off my record.

139
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:24,392
Do you think Rex is the right guy
for my first time?

140
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,230
I think he's perfect for you, Corey.

141
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,820
I need to ask your advice.

142
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:39,366
You know a lot about love
and women and that sort of thing.

143
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:44,162
My wife left me for another woman, and
my girlfriend made me leave at gunpoint.

144
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,623
- Does this qualify me?
- Definitely.

145
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:51,503
I've decided today's the day
that I'll tell Corey how I feel about her.

146
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:54,339
I know what you're thinking,
but I really am.

147
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,926
I've been working here off and on
for five years, so...

148
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,512
I've got to tell her how I feel.

149
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,055
That I...

150
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,724
Love her.

151
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,227
How do I do that?

152
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,980
You say, "I love you."

153
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,608
You want written instructions?

154
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,445
If I find that kid, I swear I'll kill him.

155
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,864
- I'll tell her this morning.
- Good.

156
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,449
By noon. Definitely.

157
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,243
No. By noon or 1:00.

158
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,079
By 1:37 exactly, Joe.

159
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,250
Good luck.

160
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:31,918
Thank you.

161
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,595
I remember the first time he sang it
on The Family Way.

162
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:45,223
I got so excited I almost choked
on a pretzel.

163
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,766
- Don't go in there.
- Why?

164
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,728
I got something to tell you. Both of you.

165
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,855
Last night something naughty happened.

166
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,648
Happy fifth anniversary.

167
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,943
- My sweetheart.
- Five years.

168
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,279
I have to tell you what happened to Lucas.

169
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,864
Hey, Berko, get up.

170
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:05,201
- I have to tell you what happened.
- Get up, Berko.

171
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,998
A little bit of focus
would make me very happy.

172
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,209
Thank you.

173
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:16,671
Come on, Lucas, pick up the phone.
Pick it up.

174
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,299
Come on, buckethead!

175
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:21,468
Hi, Joe.

176
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,596
- Does Joe know?
- Nope. Just act normal.

177
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,432
- What's up, Joe?
- What's new?

178
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,309
- How you doing?
- Damn!

179
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,560
I got green!

180
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,688
Let's see who goes first. I got a brown!

181
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,898
Anybody got brown?

182
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:35,982
Brown.

183
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,234
Orange.

184
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:40,987
Shit!

185
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:41,715
- What are you doing, man?
- Exercising my veto, man.

186
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,051
It's only 9:00.
You sure you want to do that?

187
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:47,679
Listening to this crap
will make you sterile.

188
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,225
Maybe I want to be sterile.

189
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:01,735
What are you doing here?

190
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:05,280
Calculus. I hate it,
but my dad says I've got to get an A.

191
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:08,116
You're not on until this afternoon.

192
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,119
It's Rex Manning Day.

193
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,748
Rex Manning Day.

194
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,251
Oh, Rexy, you're so sexy.

195
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,127
Gina, I got to find Corey right away.

196
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:05,006
Paging Miss Corey Mason.
Meet your smelly sister in the rotunda.

197
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:11,179
Dad said to bring this to you right away.

198
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:13,723
- Wait till you see what's in it.
- Harvard.

199
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:15,517
It's Harvard.

200
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,402
I'm afraid to open it.

201
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,037
Well? Did you get in?

202
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,375
Do they want you?

203
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:42,711
What's it say?

204
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:44,212
Yes.

205
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,924
- Yes?
- Are you sure?

206
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,761
- Oh, my God.
- Wow, you did it.

207
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,055
There is such a thing as a phone,
you know.

208
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:59,060
It's awesome. You're getting out of here.

209
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:05,066
Ladies and gentlemen,
our most valued employee, Corey Mason...

210
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,986
is going off
to secure the future of the free world.

211
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,030
Harvard!

212
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,075
Miss Mason, you just got into Harvard.

213
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,994
What are you going to do now?

214
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,412
I'm going to...

215
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,290
grow up.

216
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,421
Joe, the sign's out. On the roof.

217
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,966
Just went dead for some reason.
It's weird.

218
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:34,679
Come here, Mark.

219
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:42,771
Come here.

220
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:50,362
Come closer.

221
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:53,406
Closer.

222
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,870
Come on in, Markie.

223
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,006
Gina, Mark.

224
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:13,510
Hello, Joe.

225
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:16,763
A.J.

226
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:18,807
I want you to find Lucas.

227
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:22,060
- What do you mean, "find Lucas"?
- What do you think I mean?

228
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:23,269
I told him.

229
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,815
What was I supposed to do?
The guy threatened me.

230
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:29,067
Christ, Mark. You're killing me, man.

231
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,152
You find him and bring him here to me.

232
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:34,406
Corey, since you're here,
take over A.J.'s register. Mark.

233
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:35,782
Work.

234
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:40,036
- Gina.
- I know. Work.

235
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:55,510
Holy shit.

236
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,554
How the hell did you get in here?

237
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:58,388
Roof.

238
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,848
Is Joe in there?

239
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,642
Have you thought about
what's going to happen?

240
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:05,437
Have you thought about
what's going to happen, A.J.?

241
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,524
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I'm talking about your future, A.J.

242
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,192
- My future?
- Five.

243
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:12,569
Five years.

244
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:16,072
We need to talk about your future
and forget about mine right now.

245
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:19,200
My life is a package tour.
I'm simply the passenger.

246
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,995
Okay, then where do you end up, Lucas?

247
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,580
That's the mystery.

248
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,541
Do you know how many people
there are out there?

249
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,419
- About six billion.
- Really? Six billion.

250
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:32,005
That's a lot of people.

251
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,883
Look, Joe sent me out here
to find you, so...

252
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,176
should I?

253
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:38,636
Find yourself. I'm right here.

254
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,619
Mark, could you please not sing?

255
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:05,663
You know what, Joe?

256
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:08,792
One of these days,
I'm going to show you little people.

257
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:12,295
On that day,
I'll jump out of my wheelchair and dance.

258
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:13,755
How about today?

259
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,423
Rex Manning Day.

260
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,478
- Where's the money?
- The money is gone.

261
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,313
Yeah, I know it's gone.

262
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,148
Where's it gone to?

263
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,274
Atlantic City.

264
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,362
Is it coming back from Atlantic City?

265
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:39,447
I don't think so.

266
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,117
What's it doing in Atlantic City?

267
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:43,868
Recirculating.

268
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,004
Are you pissed off?

269
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,425
Lucas, listen to me.

270
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:02,554
I told Mitchell Beck
that you forgot to deposit the money.

271
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:05,140
I told him the money was still here.

272
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:07,809
Joe, that's not true. It's in Atlantic City.

273
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:09,811
I swear.

274
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:13,940
Shut up, sit down, and don't you move.

275
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:17,652
- It could be in other cities by now.
- Shut up!

276
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,240
Under no circumstances do I want you
to leave that couch.

277
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:26,161
Unless it's to get me $9,000.

278
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:28,955
Then you bring it here to me.

279
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:35,503
I think it'll be okay.

280
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,297
What makes you think that?

281
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:40,842
Who knows where thoughts come from?
They just appear.

282
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,929
What a moron.

283
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,565
What did you and Corey do last night?

284
00:21:57,108 --> 00:22:00,445
Well, it was Friday night,
so we went to a club.

285
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:03,531
Then we met this group
of gorgeous guys...

286
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:06,701
who invited us back to their frat house
for a few beers.

287
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:09,204
I think it got a little bit out of hand.

288
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:11,831
'Cause we ended up in a Jacuzzi...

289
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,085
in our panties...

290
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:18,546
- with all of them.
- Sorry I asked.

291
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,132
What do you think she did last night?

292
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:23,218
She went home, A.J.

293
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:25,345
Like she always does.

294
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:29,766
I, on the other hand,
got stuck with two gorgeous men.

295
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:32,352
Big men.

296
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:34,979
Huge men.

297
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:37,899
Have a nice day.

298
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:57,354
- Are you Corey Mason?
- For me?

299
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:58,980
Thank you.

300
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:01,191
- Later.
- 'Bye, thank you.

301
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:05,028
"To the number one in her class.
Harvard, 1999.

302
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:08,990
"Make me proud. Love, Daddy."
That's sweet.

303
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:11,159
God, nothing's ever enough for him.

304
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:15,663
He didn't mean it like that.
I'm sure he didn't.

305
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:16,790
Excuse me.

306
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,834
Hi. How are you today?

307
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:47,654
Hi, Deb.

308
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:58,039
Hi, Debra.

309
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:04,879
- She hates me.
- Yeah, she hates me, too.

310
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:07,924
But I have enough sense to hate her back.

311
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:14,723
- Good morning, Deb.
- Hi, Deb.

312
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:23,773
Lucas, are you in trouble?

313
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:25,984
Did you need the money?

314
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,238
If you are in trouble, you can talk to me.
You know that.

315
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,159
We're all in some kind of trouble.
Am I the only one who sees it?

316
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:36,661
You know, Deb's in trouble.

317
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,956
- A.J.'s in trouble.
- A.J.'s not in trouble.

318
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,750
And Corey is in trouble.

319
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:44,044
She's not in trouble.
She's going to Harvard.

320
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:46,004
Mark's in trouble. Eddie's in trouble...

321
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:48,089
Hey, I'm the one who's in trouble here.

322
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:49,591
'Cause every minute that goes by...

323
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:53,219
and I don't call the cops
I look like a bigger bananahead.

324
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:57,015
Joe, I can categorically say
that you are not a bigger bananahead.

325
00:25:57,807 --> 00:26:00,310
You screwed me, Lucas.
You know that, right?

326
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:01,895
What do you want me to do?

327
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:05,357
- Call Mitchell? Tell him I lied?
- It seems like a viable option.

328
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:10,570
I swear to God,
if you're fooling with me, I will kill you.

329
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:18,328
- A.J., I need another closer.
- I opened, man.

330
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:20,246
Come on. I wouldn't ask...

331
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,165
but I have got no choice.

332
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:23,792
I can close.

333
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:27,879
Yeah, I can close. It's cool.

334
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:31,007
They just raised my rent,
so I could use the money.

335
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:32,550
Damn the man!

336
00:26:33,885 --> 00:26:35,762
Oh, God, I am in hell!

337
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:41,726
Okay, it says here
that he never kills insects...

338
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,270
because he believes that they have souls.

339
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,356
He hates the color orange.

340
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:49,150
And he loves to drive real fast.

341
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:52,153
So work that into the conversation.

342
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:53,196
Okay.

343
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:55,949
God, I'm really going to do this.

344
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:58,326
Yeah, you're 17.

345
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,495
Yeah, you're right.

346
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:02,831
I've had a lot of luck with this red bra.

347
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:07,252
Looks great.

348
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:09,671
You look beautiful.

349
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:11,548
Thank you.

350
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:15,635
It's so great, it's like
all the planets are aligned or something.

351
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:18,346
It's the perfect guy.

352
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:20,724
Perfect gal.

353
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:22,559
The perfect union.

354
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:25,770
It's romance, you know?

355
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:23,555
You think it's possible for someone
to be in love with someone else...

356
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:25,181
and not even know it?

357
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:29,436
In this life,
there are nothing but possibilities.

358
00:29:31,354 --> 00:29:32,856
That's good.

359
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:35,859
I must tell Corey I love her by 1:37.

360
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:38,653
That's an excellent time.

361
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:50,331
You did have hair
when you went in there, right?

362
00:29:50,373 --> 00:29:53,376
It's still in the sink if you want to glue it.

363
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:58,673
Is it true you committed
the perfect crime?

364
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:00,967
Not entirely perfect.

365
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,555
You see that, man?

366
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:10,643
Debra, wait a minute.

367
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:12,729
- What's with you today?
- Bad hair day.

368
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:15,273
No, I mean with this. What is this?

369
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:19,861
- What happened?
- I went to rock and roll heaven...

370
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:23,907
and I wasn't on the guest list.
Now please move, I have to go to work.

371
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:26,159
No. Now you tell me what is going on!

372
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:31,790
I decided I'd rather kill myself than meet
Rex Manning. Excuse me, I'm going.

373
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:34,209
Listen to me, this isn't funny.
I'm not joking.

374
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,212
I won't let you leave
until you tell me what's going on.

375
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:39,631
- Mind your own business.
- She's fine.

376
00:30:40,131 --> 00:30:41,257
She's amazing.

377
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:45,595
Thank you.

378
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:49,224
She's in the store.

379
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:51,017
She's going to be okay.

380
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:55,146
What's with you?
Yesterday you were normal...

381
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:58,108
today you're like the Chinese guy
from The Karate Kid.

382
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:00,652
What's with you today?

383
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:03,071
What's with "today" today?

384
00:31:05,448 --> 00:31:06,658
I don't know.

385
00:31:19,254 --> 00:31:20,672
Why'd you do that?

386
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:23,508
I'm just your typical nutty teenager
in America.

387
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:27,262
Before you hear all about it...

388
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:30,265
That's supposed to be a joke, right?

389
00:31:30,306 --> 00:31:31,808
No. You're the joke.

390
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:43,820
Well, Sinead O'Rebellion...

391
00:31:45,238 --> 00:31:48,450
shock me, shock me, shock me
with that deviant behavior.

392
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:53,163
That is so clever. You get smarter
the shorter your skirt gets.

393
00:31:53,246 --> 00:31:55,457
And you get smarter
the shorter your hair gets...

394
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,001
so it's probably a good thing
you went with that.

395
00:31:58,084 --> 00:32:00,962
- It's a wonderful look for you, darling.
- Thank you.

396
00:32:31,201 --> 00:32:32,869
I have to go to the bathroom.

397
00:32:34,537 --> 00:32:36,664
I want to report a robbery.

398
00:32:37,624 --> 00:32:39,125
No, I will not hold...

399
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,639
Veto. Excuse me.

400
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,815
What's up with that?

401
00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:05,402
It's too early.
It makes the customers all crazy-like.

402
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:07,112
That's the whole point.

403
00:33:07,862 --> 00:33:08,697
Eddie!

404
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,324
What's up, dude?
I heard your music playing.

405
00:33:11,408 --> 00:33:14,411
- That's pretty scary stuff.
- Yeah, it was moshy.

406
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:18,039
I'm glad to say I made you
a tape last night, for educational purposes.

407
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:22,627
Here's the deal.
You start off with a little classical music.

408
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:25,380
Then you got some Shaggs on there,
and Residents...

409
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:28,717
- and a little Floyd and Zeppelin.
- Floyd is very cool.

410
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:32,762
And another very cool thing is,
I made you these.

411
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:36,016
They're my special recipe
and you know what that means.

412
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:37,308
Lots of sugar.

413
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:40,979
You got to understand something here.

414
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:44,024
This music is the glue of the world.

415
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:47,193
It holds it all together. Without this...

416
00:33:47,444 --> 00:33:49,487
life would be meaningless.

417
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,615
Dude, have you heard about Lucas?

418
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:53,867
Walt.

419
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,160
Joe, yeah.

420
00:33:55,243 --> 00:33:56,453
Good. You?

421
00:33:57,871 --> 00:33:59,706
Listen, weird question...

422
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,542
can I get a personal loan?

423
00:34:04,502 --> 00:34:05,628
By tonight.

424
00:34:07,922 --> 00:34:08,882
$9,000.

425
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:13,887
What are you laughing at?

426
00:34:17,307 --> 00:34:21,853
Lucas, man, I heard you went to Vegas
and married a mobster's wife...

427
00:34:21,936 --> 00:34:24,981
and now you've got a hit on you.
Is that true?

428
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,609
Not entirely true.

429
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:31,112
Outlaw Man, we salute you.

430
00:34:31,613 --> 00:34:32,447
Thank you.

431
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,406
No problem.

432
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,159
This song goes out
to our employee of the week, Lucas.

433
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:37,827
A little tribute, man.

434
00:35:17,075 --> 00:35:19,160
What the hell's this?

435
00:35:20,537 --> 00:35:23,832
"Rules and standards
for Music Town employee conduct"?

436
00:35:24,374 --> 00:35:25,959
Put these in the boxes.

437
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:30,046
- Music Town? We're not a Music Town.
- No, we're not a Music Town...

438
00:35:30,505 --> 00:35:31,297
yet.

439
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:32,966
Isn't Music Town a chain?

440
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:35,176
"No gum chewing will be allowed
inside the store"?

441
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,012
They're turning us into a Music Town?

442
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:40,056
- Why didn't you tell us?
- Because I was trying to stop it.

443
00:35:40,223 --> 00:35:41,558
What do you mean?

444
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:43,893
I got enough money
to make Mitch an offer.

445
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:47,689
He was going to make me a partner.
I could have bought him out, eventually.

446
00:35:47,772 --> 00:35:49,065
You were going to buy Empire?

447
00:35:49,149 --> 00:35:52,360
- That's a good thing, right?
- That'll be fantastic.

448
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:54,863
Do you think it'll happen now?

449
00:35:54,946 --> 00:35:57,449
I must pay for what Mr. Brilliant did.

450
00:35:57,532 --> 00:36:00,702
- It's over, kids, okay?
- Mitchell is the man.

451
00:36:00,952 --> 00:36:02,954
And "the man" calls all the shots.

452
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:04,456
Damn the man.

453
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:08,084
Let me explain it to you.

454
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:11,129
Mitchell's the man, I'm the idiot...

455
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:14,049
and you're the screw-up,
and we're all losers.

456
00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:16,718
Welcome to Music Town.

457
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:29,564
Music Town play list must be adhered to.
That means...

458
00:36:30,398 --> 00:36:33,318
No 2Pac, no Dre, no Cube...

459
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:35,362
no Snoop, no Mr. Big...

460
00:36:35,528 --> 00:36:37,072
"No visible tattoos."

461
00:36:37,155 --> 00:36:38,698
"No revealing clothing."

462
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:41,534
We're both screwed.

463
00:36:41,826 --> 00:36:43,870
At least you're used to it.

464
00:36:43,953 --> 00:36:46,039
No, Debra, don't be bitter.

465
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:49,000
With your ever-growing collection of...

466
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:51,670
flesh-mutilating silver appendages...

467
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:55,590
and your brand-new
neo-Nazi boot-camp makeover...

468
00:36:55,882 --> 00:36:59,594
- the boys will come running.
- Let's not fight, let's just rip.

469
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,142
But we mustn't dwell.

470
00:37:06,935 --> 00:37:08,269
No, not today.

471
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:11,398
We can't!

472
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:17,987
Not on Rex Manning Day.

473
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:38,318
Is it okay if I leave the couch,
'cause I'm leaving the couch, okay?

474
00:38:38,401 --> 00:38:42,530
My ass has fallen asleep.
I've got to go. I'm leaving.

475
00:38:55,752 --> 00:38:59,297
- I notice you didn't leave the couch.
- Not the whole couch.

476
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:02,842
I've decided I'm going to start a band.

477
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:03,843
Really?

478
00:39:05,762 --> 00:39:08,056
First thing you need is a name.

479
00:39:08,431 --> 00:39:11,434
Then you'll know what kind of band it is.

480
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:13,603
Yeah, I know, I know.

481
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,980
I was thinking of "Marc."

482
00:39:16,064 --> 00:39:17,399
What do you think?

483
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:20,610
Is that with a "c" or a "k"?

484
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,949
My name is with...

485
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:28,076
a "k."

486
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:32,122
So I was thinking
maybe my band could be with a "c"...

487
00:39:32,205 --> 00:39:35,792
so that way it's a psychedelic trip thing.

488
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:38,795
Always play with their minds.

489
00:39:46,469 --> 00:39:48,346
Nice selection.

490
00:39:51,933 --> 00:39:54,769
- Help you with anything?
- No, I'm all right.

491
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:57,439
- You like music?
- Yeah.

492
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,481
Me, too.

493
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:01,776
The fat man walks alone.

494
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,862
What's up?

495
00:40:04,821 --> 00:40:07,282
What are you, some kind of weirdo?

496
00:40:08,283 --> 00:40:11,036
It's a big coat you're wearing.
Lots of pocket room.

497
00:40:14,164 --> 00:40:15,415
See you.

498
00:40:15,707 --> 00:40:17,250
I'm sure I'll bump into you.

499
00:40:24,716 --> 00:40:27,302
Shoplifter!

500
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:48,198
Isn't it customary to leave the scene
after committing a crime?

501
00:40:48,281 --> 00:40:50,158
Definitely an amateur.

502
00:40:53,828 --> 00:40:56,331
Attention, Rex Manning fans, to your left...

503
00:40:56,414 --> 00:41:00,168
you will notice a shoplifter
being chased by the night manager.

504
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:02,295
This young man will be caught...

505
00:41:02,379 --> 00:41:06,841
deep-fried in a vat of hot oil,
and served to our first 100 customers.

506
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:12,013
Just another tasty treat
from the gang at Empire Records.

507
00:41:25,902 --> 00:41:26,695
Shit.

508
00:41:31,908 --> 00:41:33,284
He cut it too short.

509
00:41:33,368 --> 00:41:35,578
No, it's fine. Really. It's fabulous.

510
00:41:38,707 --> 00:41:39,708
Oh, God.

511
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:40,834
Look at this place!

512
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:44,045
There is no gig too small, all right?

513
00:41:44,087 --> 00:41:48,675
Middle America buys your records.
We got a lot of fans waiting.

514
00:41:49,592 --> 00:41:53,013
This is Joe Reaves
from the Empire Records store.

515
00:41:53,096 --> 00:41:55,473
We have a shoplifter in custody.

516
00:41:57,934 --> 00:41:59,019
How old are you?

517
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:01,563
Old enough to kick your butt
through your skull...

518
00:42:01,646 --> 00:42:03,273
and splatter your brains on the wall.

519
00:42:03,356 --> 00:42:04,649
He's a juvenile.

520
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:05,942
No, I don't think.

521
00:42:07,152 --> 00:42:08,778
What's your name?

522
00:42:08,987 --> 00:42:10,530
Warren Beatty.

523
00:42:10,905 --> 00:42:12,949
Okay, stand up.

524
00:42:14,993 --> 00:42:17,370
Hold these against your chest,
stand against the wall.

525
00:42:17,454 --> 00:42:18,455
Let them photograph you.

526
00:42:18,538 --> 00:42:20,081
Why don't you shove them up your ass?

527
00:42:20,165 --> 00:42:22,625
Because it would hurt a lot, Warren.

528
00:42:23,209 --> 00:42:24,961
Take him over there.

529
00:42:28,798 --> 00:42:31,926
And they said no revealing clothing,
didn't they?

530
00:42:33,053 --> 00:42:37,265
I think Music Town is actually torn
on the revealing garment issue.

531
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:38,975
I think so.

532
00:42:39,142 --> 00:42:41,186
Revealing clothing.

533
00:42:55,408 --> 00:42:57,786
Gina, would you get dressed.

534
00:42:58,828 --> 00:43:00,288
Turn that down.

535
00:43:00,372 --> 00:43:02,374
A.J., up on the roof. Fix the sign.

536
00:43:02,624 --> 00:43:04,376
Take the photograph.

537
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,296
Music Town. I can handle Music Town.

538
00:43:14,594 --> 00:43:17,347
Welcome to Music Town.
May I service you?

539
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:21,267
Gina...

540
00:43:21,351 --> 00:43:22,686
get dressed. Corey, work.

541
00:43:24,187 --> 00:43:25,522
You must be Joe Reaves.

542
00:43:25,605 --> 00:43:26,981
You must be Jane.

543
00:43:27,065 --> 00:43:28,274
Me, Joe. You, Jane.

544
00:43:28,358 --> 00:43:29,567
Shut up, Warren.

545
00:43:30,402 --> 00:43:33,279
- This is Rex Manning.
- Pleased to meet you.

546
00:43:33,363 --> 00:43:34,698
We all love the new album.

547
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:36,157
Good for you.

548
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:37,992
What's he doing here?

549
00:43:38,201 --> 00:43:40,370
Let me introduce you.

550
00:43:40,453 --> 00:43:42,789
This is Gina. This is Corey.

551
00:43:43,623 --> 00:43:45,250
Lucas, A. J...

552
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:47,293
and Warren.

553
00:43:47,377 --> 00:43:49,462
I'm Rex. Great to be here.

554
00:43:49,921 --> 00:43:51,339
I have all...

555
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,841
your albums.

556
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:56,094
That's terrific, Corey. Thanks.

557
00:43:56,177 --> 00:43:58,763
What happened to your hair?

558
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,477
The stylist, if you can call him that,
got carried away. No biggie.

559
00:44:04,561 --> 00:44:05,562
Looks good.

560
00:44:05,645 --> 00:44:06,813
See, he likes it?

561
00:44:06,896 --> 00:44:08,064
I like it.

562
00:44:09,232 --> 00:44:10,066
Great.

563
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,026
Let's go to work.

564
00:44:12,402 --> 00:44:13,570
Higher.

565
00:44:28,084 --> 00:44:30,628
That was fabulous, Warren, thank you.

566
00:44:35,342 --> 00:44:36,509
Women.

567
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:41,139
I still don't like my hair.

568
00:44:41,222 --> 00:44:43,099
Just try to smile.

569
00:44:45,143 --> 00:44:46,728
I don't like the chair.

570
00:44:46,811 --> 00:44:49,064
What do you mean,
you don't like the chair?

571
00:44:49,105 --> 00:44:51,733
What's wrong with the chair?
Just sit in the chair.

572
00:44:51,775 --> 00:44:53,568
I don't want to sit in it.

573
00:44:55,278 --> 00:44:57,572
You're going to stand there?

574
00:44:58,656 --> 00:45:02,118
Mr. Manning, this is a very nice chair.

575
00:45:02,202 --> 00:45:03,536
Thank you.

576
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:05,622
Pen.

577
00:45:06,998 --> 00:45:08,792
- What's your name?
- Kathy.

578
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:10,919
K-AT-H-Y.

579
00:45:12,128 --> 00:45:14,839
I've seen every episode of The Family Way.

580
00:45:15,674 --> 00:45:18,802
You were my favorite singer
in high school.

581
00:45:20,136 --> 00:45:22,263
Who's your favorite singer now?

582
00:45:22,347 --> 00:45:24,099
You! It's still you!

583
00:45:52,961 --> 00:45:54,921
There're so many babes out there!

584
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:58,800
I've got to get Rex some water
because Rex is very thirsty.

585
00:45:58,842 --> 00:46:00,468
Make sure it's bottled water.

586
00:46:03,013 --> 00:46:05,140
Who's your favorite singer?

587
00:46:05,432 --> 00:46:06,516
Axl.

588
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:10,520
If Axl Rose was driving
down the highway...

589
00:46:10,645 --> 00:46:13,815
and saw Rex Manning stranded
on the side of the road...

590
00:46:13,898 --> 00:46:16,776
would Axl Rose stop and help him?

591
00:46:20,071 --> 00:46:21,906
Does Axl have a jack?

592
00:46:22,115 --> 00:46:26,995
No way, man! Axl would spin the wheel,
take aim, pound on the gas...

593
00:46:28,705 --> 00:46:30,707
and take that sucker out!

594
00:46:33,793 --> 00:46:37,922
Warren! Where do you get
this hostility from?

595
00:46:49,351 --> 00:46:50,769
Who glued these quarters down?

596
00:46:50,852 --> 00:46:51,978
I did.

597
00:46:52,062 --> 00:46:53,980
What the hell for, man?

598
00:46:54,606 --> 00:46:58,151
I don't feel that I need
to explain my art to you.

599
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,530
Look what you took.

600
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:03,907
Rap...

601
00:47:04,407 --> 00:47:05,617
metal...

602
00:47:06,201 --> 00:47:07,369
rap...

603
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:09,162
metal...

604
00:47:09,913 --> 00:47:11,498
Whitney Houston.

605
00:47:11,748 --> 00:47:14,501
- It's for my girlfriend, okay.
- Sure it is.

606
00:47:14,584 --> 00:47:18,713
Someone like you needs
to diminish their criminal impulses...

607
00:47:18,797 --> 00:47:20,340
not magnify them.

608
00:47:20,423 --> 00:47:22,842
Maybe some jazz or classical.

609
00:47:22,926 --> 00:47:24,594
Maybe you bite me.

610
00:47:25,887 --> 00:47:27,055
Do any of you...

611
00:47:27,097 --> 00:47:29,349
like Rex Manning's new record?

612
00:47:34,479 --> 00:47:37,607
Dance Party, U.S.A.
Teenybopper type of shit.

613
00:47:38,775 --> 00:47:42,028
It tested well among teenage males.

614
00:47:42,278 --> 00:47:46,616
Did you compare the percentage
of teenage male Rex Manning fans...

615
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:50,161
to the incidents of homosexuality
among teenage males?

616
00:47:50,745 --> 00:47:51,705
No.

617
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:57,085
Who should I make it out to?

618
00:47:57,127 --> 00:47:58,420
Denise.

619
00:47:58,795 --> 00:48:01,214
Denise. I've always loved that name.

620
00:48:01,297 --> 00:48:03,758
Thank you, but it's not mine,
it's my mom's.

621
00:48:03,842 --> 00:48:06,761
She loves you.
I've never even heard of you.

622
00:48:08,513 --> 00:48:11,182
Does your mother
still have her own teeth?

623
00:48:11,266 --> 00:48:12,559
Forget it.

624
00:48:12,642 --> 00:48:13,935
Cool hair.

625
00:48:31,911 --> 00:48:34,831
- Berko.
- Lucas, heard a story about you.

626
00:48:34,956 --> 00:48:36,458
Really? Which one?

627
00:48:36,541 --> 00:48:38,877
The one where you stole $9,000...

628
00:48:39,377 --> 00:48:40,879
went to Atlantic City...

629
00:48:40,962 --> 00:48:43,381
and there's a contract out on you.

630
00:48:43,506 --> 00:48:45,925
Has anyone seen Debra today?

631
00:48:46,384 --> 00:48:47,677
We saw her.

632
00:48:48,178 --> 00:48:49,721
She shaved her head...

633
00:48:49,804 --> 00:48:52,265
and has a bandage on her wrist.

634
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:53,475
Really?

635
00:48:53,558 --> 00:48:54,768
Really.

636
00:48:56,853 --> 00:48:58,146
Who are you?

637
00:48:58,229 --> 00:48:59,481
I'm Jane.

638
00:49:00,732 --> 00:49:02,650
I work for Rex Manning.

639
00:49:10,825 --> 00:49:12,702
You think that's funny?

640
00:49:16,998 --> 00:49:18,792
If you'll excuse me.

641
00:49:22,128 --> 00:49:23,380
Hey, Joe.

642
00:49:25,423 --> 00:49:27,467
I need a change of scenery.

643
00:49:27,717 --> 00:49:30,970
I know, sometimes it's like a monkey cage
out there.

644
00:49:31,096 --> 00:49:33,765
It's not them. It's Rex.

645
00:49:35,266 --> 00:49:37,936
I don't even like his music.

646
00:49:39,688 --> 00:49:42,399
I wouldn't be too embarrassed about that.

647
00:49:46,236 --> 00:49:47,320
God!

648
00:49:48,571 --> 00:49:50,740
I don't know what I'm doing.

649
00:49:51,741 --> 00:49:55,203
You know, I used to be
a much more interesting person.

650
00:50:05,755 --> 00:50:08,675
Look. I think I used to be
a much more interesting person.

651
00:50:08,758 --> 00:50:10,385
- I used to be a musician.
- Yeah?

652
00:50:10,468 --> 00:50:12,387
Yeah, I was a good one.

653
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:13,763
And now...

654
00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:18,101
I manage a record store.

655
00:50:21,688 --> 00:50:24,399
So how did I come up
with the name Marc?

656
00:50:24,649 --> 00:50:28,194
Well, it's a very interesting story.
I remember as though it was yesterday.

657
00:50:28,278 --> 00:50:30,321
Have you seen Debra?

658
00:50:30,613 --> 00:50:34,117
Depends on what you mean by "seen"
because I've seen her...

659
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,037
- but not...
- We can't find her anywhere.

660
00:50:43,376 --> 00:50:47,380
All I know is that you just can't wait
for things to get better.

661
00:50:57,766 --> 00:50:59,601
You know, you're right.

662
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,561
Where are you going?

663
00:51:01,644 --> 00:51:04,356
I don't know. I've never been to Paris.

664
00:51:04,898 --> 00:51:06,483
You're quitting?

665
00:51:06,566 --> 00:51:07,650
You can't quit.

666
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:10,028
You can't quit. Not today, come on!

667
00:51:10,111 --> 00:51:11,613
Come on, Jane.

668
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:12,822
I owe you one.

669
00:51:12,906 --> 00:51:15,283
Look, could you put this off till...

670
00:52:59,429 --> 00:53:03,058
Excuse me, ladies.
Less shimmy, more selling. Thanks.

671
00:53:03,641 --> 00:53:05,310
Guess who's here.

672
00:53:07,062 --> 00:53:09,481
How are you?
Mitchell Beck. I own this place.

673
00:53:09,564 --> 00:53:11,941
Good to meet you. You have a nice store.

674
00:53:12,025 --> 00:53:15,695
Nice of you to say.
You should have seen it originally.

675
00:53:15,779 --> 00:53:18,907
Beck's Bath and Bidet,
bathroom fixtures emporium.

676
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:20,408
My grandfather started it.

677
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:24,162
It was my beatnik father
who turned it into a record store.

678
00:53:24,454 --> 00:53:27,749
I tell you, if I was selling toilets today,
I'd be a rich man.

679
00:53:29,167 --> 00:53:31,378
What's with you?
You're sweating like a pig.

680
00:53:31,461 --> 00:53:33,755
It's nice to see you, too.

681
00:53:33,797 --> 00:53:36,424
Joe, come on.
Is this the way we treat Mr. Manning?

682
00:53:36,508 --> 00:53:40,470
- Where's the fresh fruit? Champagne?
- That's not necessary, thank you.

683
00:53:40,553 --> 00:53:42,639
- He's a big star.
- Big, huge star. Big.

684
00:53:42,722 --> 00:53:44,933
Let's get him something.

685
00:53:45,809 --> 00:53:49,270
I'm going to the bank.
Give me last night's deposit.

686
00:53:49,354 --> 00:53:52,482
- I wanna make sure it gets there this time.
- I'll take care of it.

687
00:53:52,565 --> 00:53:54,776
No, you're a busy man, let me.

688
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:58,029
I said I'll handle it.

689
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:07,288
Mitch, have you met Warren?

690
00:54:07,414 --> 00:54:08,623
Who're you?

691
00:54:08,707 --> 00:54:09,958
Lucas. I work here.

692
00:54:11,334 --> 00:54:13,128
Have you met Warren?

693
00:54:13,378 --> 00:54:15,463
I wanted to talk to you about him.

694
00:54:15,547 --> 00:54:18,008
Young Warren came into the store today...

695
00:54:18,091 --> 00:54:21,052
and put on a little demonstration
for all the store employees.

696
00:54:21,136 --> 00:54:24,597
Very motivational.
It was inspiring, actually.

697
00:54:24,931 --> 00:54:28,435
He just made quite an impression
on everybody.

698
00:54:28,727 --> 00:54:30,979
I'm intrigued. I'm spellbound.

699
00:54:32,564 --> 00:54:35,400
That wasn't so hard, was it? Thank you.

700
00:54:48,663 --> 00:54:51,291
Corey, I've got to tell you something.

701
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,336
It's about how I feel about you.

702
00:54:57,088 --> 00:55:00,216
I really, really...

703
00:55:02,886 --> 00:55:03,928
Oh, God...

704
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:07,057
You know that feeling you get
when you get out of a hot bath?

705
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,559
You just feel really refreshed and nice.

706
00:55:09,642 --> 00:55:11,644
Well, you make me feel like...

707
00:55:11,728 --> 00:55:13,313
You make me feel like a bath?

708
00:55:13,396 --> 00:55:16,649
You're like vanilla ice cream.
French vanilla ice cream.

709
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:25,325
Like your hair.

710
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:31,456
Are you okay?

711
00:55:31,539 --> 00:55:33,708
Why do you care?
You didn't care last night.

712
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,085
Yes, I did.

713
00:55:36,378 --> 00:55:38,713
Look, this isn't about you, okay?

714
00:55:39,589 --> 00:55:43,718
I got home last night and I thought
about everything that had happened...

715
00:55:43,802 --> 00:55:47,305
and what happened the night before that...

716
00:55:47,389 --> 00:55:50,183
and the week before that
and the year before that.

717
00:55:50,308 --> 00:55:54,104
The only thing that was different was
something else was making me feel shitty.

718
00:55:54,187 --> 00:55:56,147
I'm trying to say I'm sorry.

719
00:55:56,231 --> 00:55:58,191
I just said, this wasn't about you.

720
00:56:00,402 --> 00:56:03,780
You didn't do anything wrong.
I'm screwed up.

721
00:56:03,863 --> 00:56:05,407
We're all screwed up.

722
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:07,033
Don't touch me right now.

723
00:56:07,117 --> 00:56:10,620
I want you to get up,
and I want you to walk away.

724
00:56:17,877 --> 00:56:19,379
This is bullshit!

725
00:56:19,462 --> 00:56:23,174
The long arm of the law
has embraced our dear friend Warren.

726
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:26,052
I'm Joe Reaves, manager.
Everything okay?

727
00:56:26,136 --> 00:56:28,388
Joe, tell them what he did.

728
00:56:28,471 --> 00:56:31,266
- You need a statement?
- No, Mr. Lucas gave us one.

729
00:56:31,307 --> 00:56:34,811
Mr. Lucas over there. He took $9,000!

730
00:56:34,978 --> 00:56:37,605
- That's enough.
- I only took a couple of CDs.

731
00:56:37,689 --> 00:56:40,567
Come on. Lucas,
I thought you were my friend.

732
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:44,529
- Don't let the man get you down.
- I don't wanna see you back in the store.

733
00:56:44,612 --> 00:56:47,407
I'm gonna get you!
I'm not playing this time!

734
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:49,909
I'll be back and you'll be sorry!

735
00:56:50,076 --> 00:56:52,078
You'll hang for this!

736
00:56:52,746 --> 00:56:54,330
"You'll be sorry!"

737
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:56,249
I'm already sorry.

738
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:18,855
Hi. I'm just doing
the quarterly income tax returns.

739
00:57:18,938 --> 00:57:20,523
Almost done.

740
00:57:24,694 --> 00:57:26,154
Look, Deb...

741
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:30,825
if you need to talk about anything...

742
00:57:32,118 --> 00:57:33,912
You gonna fix me, Joe?

743
00:57:35,038 --> 00:57:37,040
Fix me. I'll listen.

744
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:40,293
I didn't mean that.

745
00:57:40,502 --> 00:57:43,546
Should I call your mother or something?

746
00:57:43,963 --> 00:57:45,840
Great. You know, if you find her...

747
00:57:45,882 --> 00:57:50,053
could you give me her number,
because I'd like to talk to her myself.

748
00:57:52,222 --> 00:57:54,599
I know you didn't mean anything.

749
00:57:59,312 --> 00:58:01,523
You're doing a good job.

750
00:58:10,115 --> 00:58:11,908
I feel a lot better.

751
00:58:15,787 --> 00:58:16,788
Dear.

752
00:58:17,038 --> 00:58:18,373
Best boss in the world.

753
00:58:18,581 --> 00:58:20,625
Can I bring Rex his lunch?

754
00:58:20,792 --> 00:58:23,003
Berko's taking him his lunch.

755
00:58:23,503 --> 00:58:27,507
You know that Berko's going to insult him
right to his face. It's not a good idea.

756
00:58:27,549 --> 00:58:31,261
I don't care if Berko sticks an M-80
up his butt and lights it.

757
00:58:31,344 --> 00:58:35,348
I hope he sticks one up mine.
It'd be an improvement.

758
00:58:35,515 --> 00:58:37,726
I have to bring Rex his lunch.

759
00:58:37,767 --> 00:58:39,060
Berko is.

760
00:58:39,352 --> 00:58:42,022
Joe, I need to bring him his lunch.

761
00:58:43,189 --> 00:58:44,441
Berko is.

762
00:58:44,774 --> 00:58:46,860
I'm bringing Rex his lunch!

763
00:58:49,487 --> 00:58:50,822
All right.

764
00:58:52,198 --> 00:58:53,575
Thanks, Joe.

765
00:58:54,367 --> 00:58:55,827
Thanks a lot.

766
00:59:34,491 --> 00:59:37,410
- Guava food groups.
- Good-bye, Mark.

767
00:59:40,997 --> 00:59:43,208
Well, this looks very elegant.

768
00:59:46,044 --> 00:59:50,048
Boy, talking to all those women
can make you work up an appetite.

769
00:59:52,342 --> 00:59:53,802
I'll bet it does.

770
00:59:54,969 --> 00:59:57,764
I got everything. I'm all set. Thank you.

771
00:59:57,847 --> 00:59:59,057
So am I.

772
01:00:04,813 --> 01:00:08,983
I can't help but notice
you sitting there staring at me.

773
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:11,945
I was thinking how I used to imagine
marrying you...

774
01:00:12,028 --> 01:00:14,489
when you were on The Family Way.

775
01:00:15,031 --> 01:00:18,159
Marrying me?
You must've been a baby back then.

776
01:00:23,707 --> 01:00:25,500
I'm not a baby now.

777
01:00:28,628 --> 01:00:30,422
You're a sweet girl.

778
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:35,802
I'm not as sweet as you think.

779
01:00:36,511 --> 01:00:38,138
How old are you?

780
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:40,348
Old enough.

781
01:00:46,855 --> 01:00:48,565
Sure you want to do this?

782
01:00:48,648 --> 01:00:50,025
Definitely.

783
01:00:58,241 --> 01:01:00,702
I hope you like the taste of blue cheese.

784
01:01:09,586 --> 01:01:10,670
Rock and roll.

785
01:01:32,817 --> 01:01:34,486
What are you doing here?

786
01:01:34,569 --> 01:01:36,905
I'm fixing the sign.
What are you doing here?

787
01:01:36,988 --> 01:01:38,531
Taking a break.

788
01:01:39,157 --> 01:01:43,078
It's so weird that you just came up here.
I have to tell you something.

789
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:45,372
Not now, please. Please A.J., no.

790
01:01:45,455 --> 01:01:48,958
No, it has to be now.
You remember that really horrible day...

791
01:01:49,042 --> 01:01:51,252
when Mark set off the store alarm...

792
01:01:51,336 --> 01:01:54,172
and Gina got dumped by Dennis
and cried all day...

793
01:01:54,255 --> 01:01:57,384
and I drew the picture of him
and Lucas made a voodoo doll...

794
01:01:57,467 --> 01:02:00,053
- and you wore that skirt that I hate?
- What skirt?

795
01:02:00,136 --> 01:02:02,389
- The one with the flowers.
- The blue skirt?

796
01:02:02,472 --> 01:02:05,433
Yeah, the blue one. I hate that skirt.

797
01:02:05,934 --> 01:02:09,771
It's good that I hate that skirt. Listen.

798
01:02:09,854 --> 01:02:13,233
Listen to me.
That skirt made me realize that...

799
01:02:13,316 --> 01:02:16,611
if I can love her in that skirt,
then this must really be it.

800
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:20,782
Corey, I love you.

801
01:02:22,492 --> 01:02:23,576
What?

802
01:02:24,619 --> 01:02:26,830
I'm in love with you.

803
01:02:27,247 --> 01:02:29,249
I mean, I've been in love with you.

804
01:02:30,625 --> 01:02:33,044
Wow, please, not now. Please, A.J.

805
01:02:33,169 --> 01:02:37,841
Please don't do this right now.
I'm sorry, but I can't handle this right now.

806
01:02:37,924 --> 01:02:41,094
Are you telling me
you could handle it some other time?

807
01:02:41,177 --> 01:02:42,137
Look...

808
01:02:42,178 --> 01:02:44,973
I just threw myself at Rex Manning, okay?

809
01:02:45,432 --> 01:02:48,435
And made a total fool of myself.

810
01:02:48,518 --> 01:02:51,730
- You what?
- Yes, and I'm not ready for this, okay?

811
01:02:52,605 --> 01:02:54,274
I'm sorry.

812
01:02:58,028 --> 01:03:00,655
I'm sorry, I just want to be alone, okay?

813
01:03:00,739 --> 01:03:02,115
Yeah, okay.

814
01:03:06,494 --> 01:03:08,580
Forget I said anything, okay?

815
01:03:08,663 --> 01:03:12,167
Just forget it. I didn't say anything.
Nothing happened.

816
01:03:33,855 --> 01:03:36,066
Forget about Rex.
We'll get you another guy...

817
01:03:36,149 --> 01:03:38,526
I don't want another guy. I'm not like you.

818
01:03:38,568 --> 01:03:42,280
I don't need one.
Why do you try and make me like you?

819
01:03:42,364 --> 01:03:44,324
What do you mean?

820
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:52,707
I'm not like you. I don't need to do
what you do all the time.

821
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:54,209
Okay. I see.

822
01:03:54,292 --> 01:03:57,212
Not like me, the turbo slut.
Is that what you mean?

823
01:03:57,337 --> 01:04:00,465
Are you saying
that I've got to do every guy I see?

824
01:04:00,548 --> 01:04:02,884
You certainly seem to enjoy it.

825
01:04:07,222 --> 01:04:09,140
What did you do?

826
01:04:09,432 --> 01:04:12,852
Did you act all perfect
and better than everybody?

827
01:04:12,936 --> 01:04:15,814
- You think guys like you for that?
- They may not like it...

828
01:04:15,897 --> 01:04:19,567
but at least they don't do it with me
and go off and laugh.

829
01:04:22,028 --> 01:04:23,697
God, you're mean.

830
01:04:34,916 --> 01:04:38,044
There you are. Is Rex Manning in yet?

831
01:04:38,128 --> 01:04:41,673
If he is, show him my eight-track.
It's great. It's The Family Way.

832
01:04:41,756 --> 01:04:44,217
It's in the vinyl section,
right underneath the...

833
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:46,803
- Please!
- What'd I do?

834
01:04:51,016 --> 01:04:53,143
You forgot your thingy!

835
01:05:27,052 --> 01:05:30,096
It's just something
I've always been able to do.

836
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:32,974
I can tell you what color and what kind.

837
01:05:33,725 --> 01:05:36,144
All right. What am I wearing now?

838
01:05:36,394 --> 01:05:37,520
Jockeys.

839
01:05:37,604 --> 01:05:38,980
Navy blue.

840
01:05:40,315 --> 01:05:41,691
Am I right?

841
01:05:41,941 --> 01:05:44,444
- I don't know.
- Well, why don't you check it out...

842
01:05:44,527 --> 01:05:46,321
and you let me know.

843
01:06:06,049 --> 01:06:07,342
Perfect.

844
01:06:32,534 --> 01:06:34,536
Now, the $64,000 question.

845
01:06:59,894 --> 01:07:01,688
That's really nice.

846
01:07:02,272 --> 01:07:03,398
Don't.

847
01:07:03,773 --> 01:07:05,108
Don't what?

848
01:07:05,775 --> 01:07:08,028
Pretend like nothing happened.

849
01:07:11,322 --> 01:07:13,575
When you told me that before...

850
01:07:13,658 --> 01:07:15,660
I freaked because...

851
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:20,915
I don't think about you like that.
You're my best friend.

852
01:07:21,082 --> 01:07:23,626
I think we have something
better than that.

853
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:24,919
Better.

854
01:07:26,296 --> 01:07:27,922
That's bullshit.

855
01:07:28,298 --> 01:07:30,342
You know it's bullshit.

856
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:26,272
One for Miss Teen America.

857
01:08:26,773 --> 01:08:29,067
It's okay. I didn't spit on it.

858
01:08:29,651 --> 01:08:31,152
"Dishonesty"?

859
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:32,946
What's that supposed to mean?

860
01:08:32,987 --> 01:08:35,448
And one for the man with the band.

861
01:08:38,034 --> 01:08:39,411
"Marc sucks."

862
01:08:44,165 --> 01:08:47,502
Hey, A.J., I made you a button.

863
01:08:47,752 --> 01:08:49,754
- "Stupid."
- You're just in time.

864
01:08:49,838 --> 01:08:51,297
Please.

865
01:08:51,381 --> 01:08:52,674
It's a surprise.

866
01:08:53,675 --> 01:08:55,093
Veto! Veto!

867
01:08:55,176 --> 01:08:58,471
- I'm not listening to it.
- No, we're dancing to it.

868
01:09:00,348 --> 01:09:02,934
I am not going to dance to Rex Manning.
I'm not dancing.

869
01:09:03,059 --> 01:09:06,271
Why not? I am Rex Manning. I'm so sexy.

870
01:09:06,354 --> 01:09:08,606
- No. You're stupid.
- No, I'm sexy.

871
01:09:08,690 --> 01:09:09,899
Get off!

872
01:09:24,456 --> 01:09:25,498
Wait.

873
01:10:09,668 --> 01:10:11,419
You all having fun?

874
01:10:12,671 --> 01:10:14,005
I hope so!

875
01:10:15,548 --> 01:10:18,343
Don't let me stop you! Keep dancing!

876
01:10:18,968 --> 01:10:21,054
You better do it now...

877
01:10:21,096 --> 01:10:24,933
because by next week
this will be a Music Town!

878
01:10:25,266 --> 01:10:28,687
And I don't think they allow dancing
in Music Town!

879
01:10:29,562 --> 01:10:32,315
What are we supposed to do instead, Joe?

880
01:10:34,109 --> 01:10:36,486
What am I gonna do with this guy?

881
01:10:37,278 --> 01:10:38,905
What should I do?

882
01:10:39,989 --> 01:10:42,909
Turn him into the police? Send him to jail?

883
01:10:43,243 --> 01:10:47,247
Who do you think he's gonna come to
when he wants bail? Who?

884
01:10:47,872 --> 01:10:49,374
Me, right? Me.

885
01:10:50,458 --> 01:10:52,043
What should I do?

886
01:10:52,544 --> 01:10:55,630
Put in my own $9,000?
And then I'm screwed!

887
01:10:58,091 --> 01:11:00,885
Don't worry, Joe.
You're a superb manager.

888
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:03,388
Really?

889
01:11:04,681 --> 01:11:05,890
Superb.

890
01:11:09,853 --> 01:11:11,521
Keep it up.

891
01:11:11,688 --> 01:11:12,897
Superb.

892
01:11:13,773 --> 01:11:15,775
- Say it again.
- Superb.

893
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:19,571
- You shit!
- That's my shoulder!

894
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:23,199
Get in there, pinhead!

895
01:11:26,536 --> 01:11:28,038
No, don't.

896
01:11:29,497 --> 01:11:30,832
Don't do it. Joe.

897
01:11:48,099 --> 01:11:51,353
- You deserved that.
- I know.

898
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:55,190
Where's Rex?

899
01:11:56,399 --> 01:11:59,611
Got a better question: Where's Gina?

900
01:12:08,411 --> 01:12:10,163
I'll look upstairs.

901
01:12:10,497 --> 01:12:12,457
I'll check the bathroom.

902
01:12:12,874 --> 01:12:16,169
- I'll check in storage.
- I'll check the sofa.

903
01:12:18,213 --> 01:12:21,049
How's it going, man?
Joe, I'm sorry I'm late.

904
01:12:21,132 --> 01:12:24,427
I brought pizza, in case anyone's hungry.

905
01:12:24,552 --> 01:12:26,221
So, what's up, man?

906
01:12:26,346 --> 01:12:29,724
Why you guys looking so glum?
Where's sexy Rexy?

907
01:12:30,058 --> 01:12:32,894
It's funny that you put it that way.

908
01:12:33,728 --> 01:12:34,854
What?

909
01:12:35,146 --> 01:12:38,358
I'm not feeling so good.
Can I count out now?

910
01:12:43,571 --> 01:12:45,407
Why is the door locked?

911
01:12:46,574 --> 01:12:48,034
Where's Gina?

912
01:12:50,036 --> 01:12:51,746
Where's Rex?

913
01:13:07,262 --> 01:13:08,930
What, no applause?

914
01:13:13,059 --> 01:13:14,269
Get off!

915
01:13:14,853 --> 01:13:17,188
A.J.! A.J., stop. He's not worth it.

916
01:13:20,275 --> 01:13:21,901
Wise up, junior.

917
01:13:25,864 --> 01:13:29,075
Take your purse
and get the hell out of my store.

918
01:13:29,325 --> 01:13:31,536
- Where's Jane?
- She quit.

919
01:13:31,703 --> 01:13:32,495
What?

920
01:13:32,579 --> 01:13:35,290
I lied about your hair. It looks stupid.

921
01:13:35,331 --> 01:13:38,710
- And we all hate your new album.
- Not to mention the ones before that.

922
01:13:38,793 --> 01:13:41,421
You're a washed-up imposter.

923
01:13:44,215 --> 01:13:45,467
Imposter?

924
01:13:48,261 --> 01:13:50,055
You know something?

925
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:52,307
You could all be right.

926
01:13:54,684 --> 01:13:57,270
How could you? With Rex Manning?

927
01:13:57,937 --> 01:13:59,481
I hate you.

928
01:14:00,190 --> 01:14:02,192
You better go home.

929
01:14:02,984 --> 01:14:04,361
Am I fired?

930
01:14:04,652 --> 01:14:08,281
Have I fired anyone today?
No. Why would I start with you?

931
01:14:10,033 --> 01:14:14,162
Is this how your life's going to be now?
You're going to screw every has-been...

932
01:14:14,245 --> 01:14:17,165
until your tits fall down
and they don't want you anymore?

933
01:14:17,207 --> 01:14:21,378
At least I don't hide what I am.
Right, Corey?

934
01:14:22,295 --> 01:14:26,299
At least I'm not
some closet speed freak, right?

935
01:14:26,508 --> 01:14:30,303
You think I don't see what you do?
You think I don't see?

936
01:14:30,345 --> 01:14:33,181
- Shut up!
- I know what you do! What's this?

937
01:14:34,599 --> 01:14:36,685
What's this? What are these?

938
01:14:36,768 --> 01:14:40,355
What are these? Aspirins?
Vitamins? Breath mints?

939
01:14:40,522 --> 01:14:41,856
Diet pills?

940
01:14:43,483 --> 01:14:45,568
- What a surprise!
- Stop it!

941
01:14:45,652 --> 01:14:47,821
You know what, I could study all night...

942
01:14:47,862 --> 01:14:51,157
if I was chowing down speed, too,
you know that I could.

943
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:54,953
Here's one for your perfect little face!
And your perfect body!

944
01:14:55,036 --> 01:14:55,870
Shut up!

945
01:14:55,954 --> 01:14:58,373
And your perfect family
and your perfect school!

946
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:03,211
- And your perfect, perfect future!
- Gina, stop it!

947
01:15:04,921 --> 01:15:06,715
- I'm stopping!
- Go home.

948
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:09,926
It's always about her.

949
01:15:12,012 --> 01:15:14,097
It'll be fine. Really.

950
01:15:14,222 --> 01:15:16,307
No. It's not going to be fine!

951
01:15:16,391 --> 01:15:19,978
Nothing's ever fine, Joe! I'll show you fine!

952
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:22,397
I'll show you perfect!

953
01:15:22,522 --> 01:15:24,691
I hate you!

954
01:15:40,582 --> 01:15:43,251
Joe, let me take care of her, come on.

955
01:15:44,627 --> 01:15:48,465
- Please, I can take care of her, Joe.
- Let's get her up, come on.

956
01:15:54,596 --> 01:15:55,555
Up!

957
01:15:58,767 --> 01:15:59,934
Better?

958
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,562
Come on. Let's dry you off.

959
01:16:13,782 --> 01:16:16,701
I guess nobody really has it all together.

960
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:18,578
No.

961
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:22,749
I feel like I should welcome you
to the neighborhood.

962
01:16:30,632 --> 01:16:34,678
Did you really want to do Rex Manning
in the count-out room?

963
01:16:34,969 --> 01:16:38,306
Is that how you always imagined
your first time would be?

964
01:16:38,348 --> 01:16:40,767
Your back up against the daily totals...

965
01:16:40,809 --> 01:16:43,561
and your feet pounding against the safe?

966
01:16:44,312 --> 01:16:46,147
"Oh, Rexy, stop that!

967
01:16:46,773 --> 01:16:48,274
"You're so sexy!"

968
01:16:55,281 --> 01:16:57,617
Why are you being so nice to me?

969
01:16:59,411 --> 01:17:01,705
Let's save our Hallmark moment.

970
01:17:08,837 --> 01:17:10,588
Hey, what's up, man?

971
01:17:13,717 --> 01:17:15,593
- How's your head?
- It's fine.

972
01:17:18,471 --> 01:17:20,557
- Is Corey okay?
- I think so.

973
01:17:20,807 --> 01:17:22,434
Yeah, she's cool.

974
01:17:25,186 --> 01:17:28,481
Wish there was a way
we could help out Joe, though.

975
01:17:29,607 --> 01:17:31,693
Yeah, but who's got $9,000?

976
01:17:32,318 --> 01:17:33,528
I don't.

977
01:17:34,696 --> 01:17:37,240
What about you, A.J., you got $9,000?

978
01:17:38,783 --> 01:17:42,203
You think I'll still be working here
if I had $9,000?

979
01:17:43,663 --> 01:17:45,832
Yeah, I think you would.

980
01:17:47,834 --> 01:17:49,210
I think you would, too.

981
01:17:55,175 --> 01:17:58,178
When I call Mitchell,
he's gonna call the cops.

982
01:17:59,095 --> 01:18:02,682
- So you can leave if you want.
- I am not leaving, Joe.

983
01:18:08,396 --> 01:18:11,149
You know when my old man
used to drink...

984
01:18:12,776 --> 01:18:14,361
which was often...

985
01:18:16,571 --> 01:18:20,533
he used to say to me,
"You will never amount to anything."

986
01:18:22,077 --> 01:18:23,578
Don't give up.

987
01:18:25,121 --> 01:18:26,748
You're 21, Lucas.

988
01:18:27,457 --> 01:18:28,750
I'm not.

989
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,421
It's too late.

990
01:18:43,181 --> 01:18:45,517
Put the glue in like this.

991
01:18:46,601 --> 01:18:48,645
Pop that sucker down right on top of it.

992
01:18:49,604 --> 01:18:50,647
And then flip the...

993
01:18:50,730 --> 01:18:52,357
Hey, man, what are you doing?

994
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:56,444
Don't get your thumbprints all over it.
Look, there's thumbprints there now.

995
01:18:56,528 --> 01:18:59,656
Wanna wreck the whole record, dude?
You're crazy, man.

996
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,173
Hey, Mark!

997
01:19:20,927 --> 01:19:23,763
You love Gwar!
Why don't you join the band?

998
01:19:39,988 --> 01:19:42,907
Mark, man, you play a mean guitar!

999
01:19:42,991 --> 01:19:46,411
It's really a shame that you must die!

1000
01:19:50,373 --> 01:19:52,375
Wait. Hey, come on.

1001
01:20:12,354 --> 01:20:14,022
I love you, Eddie.

1002
01:20:21,821 --> 01:20:24,407
Do you need a new night manager?

1003
01:20:25,367 --> 01:20:28,119
- What are you doing later?
- I don't know.

1004
01:20:28,536 --> 01:20:31,998
I'm either going to jail or hell,
I can't decide which.

1005
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:36,878
Wherever you're going,
would you have dinner with me first?

1006
01:20:37,253 --> 01:20:38,505
You bet.

1007
01:20:40,548 --> 01:20:43,093
"Rest in peace. Deb."

1008
01:20:44,219 --> 01:20:46,096
Death is in the cards, huh?

1009
01:20:48,223 --> 01:20:50,642
Lucas, why did you take that money?

1010
01:20:53,186 --> 01:20:54,896
Do you have a plan?

1011
01:20:57,065 --> 01:20:58,066
No.

1012
01:20:59,984 --> 01:21:01,986
Not a comprehensive plan.

1013
01:21:04,406 --> 01:21:05,949
I think you do.

1014
01:21:16,751 --> 01:21:18,837
A funeral.

1015
01:21:27,762 --> 01:21:31,391
- I am not going.
- You don't have a choice, if you're dead.

1016
01:21:34,185 --> 01:21:37,397
- What's RIP mean?
- Really Idiotic Party.

1017
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:42,360
Hey, man, there's your problem.

1018
01:21:42,444 --> 01:21:44,988
- Somebody burned it.
- No.

1019
01:21:45,071 --> 01:21:48,158
If you were listening to records
and somebody burned it...

1020
01:21:48,241 --> 01:21:51,786
or put water on it or something,
it wouldn't wreck 'em, just warp 'em a bit.

1021
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:54,289
Sometimes that makes them
even sound better.

1022
01:21:54,372 --> 01:21:57,917
The only thing that can destroy records
is some freak who kicks 'em...

1023
01:21:58,001 --> 01:22:01,838
- and throws 'em on the ground.
- It's only 'cause I'm not in a band, right?

1024
01:22:01,921 --> 01:22:06,259
Because you know if I was in a band
they would not be doing this to me.

1025
01:22:06,426 --> 01:22:08,386
If you didn't listen to CDs.

1026
01:22:10,638 --> 01:22:13,933
- Clapton on vinyl.
- Could you be a bit more vague, man?

1027
01:22:14,267 --> 01:22:18,021
We got lots of Clapton on vinyl. We got
Clapton with John Mayall, with Yardbirds.

1028
01:22:18,104 --> 01:22:21,149
Clapton with Derek & The Dominoes.
Clapton with Blind Faith.

1029
01:22:21,232 --> 01:22:23,443
The Rainbow concert from '73.

1030
01:22:23,651 --> 01:22:26,738
Do you want him solo, unplugged,
you want him with Cream?

1031
01:22:26,821 --> 01:22:29,741
- You wanted the tapes with Jimmy Page?
- Cool.

1032
01:22:30,158 --> 01:22:32,369
- Where is it?
- Over there, man.

1033
01:22:33,286 --> 01:22:36,373
Hey, Eddie, do you have The Shaggs
on 45, Philosophy of The World?

1034
01:22:36,456 --> 01:22:39,918
I know that you have the album,
but I'm looking for the 45...

1035
01:22:40,001 --> 01:22:42,462
- Deb...
- Did you know that their second album...

1036
01:22:42,504 --> 01:22:44,714
got stolen from
their family's trailer home...

1037
01:22:44,798 --> 01:22:47,676
- Deb, can I see it?
- Never found it again. I wonder what...

1038
01:22:47,759 --> 01:22:49,511
Please.

1039
01:22:50,011 --> 01:22:52,847
Shaggs are definitely
the hottest punk rock band.

1040
01:22:53,765 --> 01:22:55,100
I love radicals.

1041
01:22:55,684 --> 01:22:56,893
Got it.

1042
01:22:57,143 --> 01:22:59,729
Hey, Eddie, would you play it for me?

1043
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:03,483
Yeah, no problem. I'll do anything for you.

1044
01:23:18,748 --> 01:23:22,544
We are gathered here today
to pay our last respects to Debra.

1045
01:23:23,378 --> 01:23:25,714
She left us and never said why.

1046
01:23:26,881 --> 01:23:28,717
But I am really going to miss her.

1047
01:23:28,758 --> 01:23:31,803
And I wish that I could have known her
a little bit better.

1048
01:23:31,886 --> 01:23:34,889
- Dogshit.
- Hey, dead people don't talk.

1049
01:23:36,307 --> 01:23:39,853
- Berko, would you like to say something?
- Deb, I just...

1050
01:23:41,730 --> 01:23:44,524
I just want you to stay. That's all.

1051
01:23:45,358 --> 01:23:47,861
A.J., do you have something to say?

1052
01:23:50,071 --> 01:23:52,991
Well, is it better to know or not to know?

1053
01:23:53,616 --> 01:23:57,203
You see, I want to go to art school.
But I'm afraid.

1054
01:23:58,288 --> 01:23:59,914
Jesus, I hate this funeral.

1055
01:24:03,668 --> 01:24:06,379
Empire Records, open till midnight.
This is Mark.

1056
01:24:06,796 --> 01:24:08,298
- Midnight?
- Yes.

1057
01:24:16,181 --> 01:24:18,641
Help me! Help me!

1058
01:24:19,267 --> 01:24:21,102
Oh, God!

1059
01:24:21,269 --> 01:24:23,730
- I'll take care of him, boss.
- Okay.

1060
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:29,110
I really miss Gina.

1061
01:24:30,487 --> 01:24:34,115
That's really special, but aren't we
supposed to be talking about me?

1062
01:24:34,199 --> 01:24:37,118
I know, I just can't stop
thinking about her.

1063
01:24:38,119 --> 01:24:42,207
She's not afraid of life,
and she's not afraid to be herself.

1064
01:24:43,792 --> 01:24:46,419
And I wish that I could be like that.

1065
01:24:46,461 --> 01:24:49,089
I wish I could be brave like Gina.

1066
01:24:50,799 --> 01:24:52,258
You are brave.

1067
01:24:52,884 --> 01:24:54,928
You're getting out of here.

1068
01:24:55,637 --> 01:24:58,848
You're always talking about
how I do what I want to do...

1069
01:24:58,932 --> 01:25:00,308
but I don't.

1070
01:25:01,476 --> 01:25:05,313
I don't, because I want to sing in a band...

1071
01:25:07,399 --> 01:25:10,318
but I don't have the guts to even audition.

1072
01:25:12,028 --> 01:25:16,616
And I know that if I don't do something,
I'm going to end up like my mother.

1073
01:25:16,866 --> 01:25:19,661
Her life ended after high school.

1074
01:25:20,745 --> 01:25:24,791
You're never going to be like your mother
if you don't want to be like her.

1075
01:25:27,711 --> 01:25:30,088
You're going to be fine.

1076
01:25:30,505 --> 01:25:33,967
That is so sweet, I think I'm going to barf.
Excuse me.

1077
01:25:34,175 --> 01:25:35,719
- Get down here.
- Here.

1078
01:25:39,556 --> 01:25:40,807
Hi, Mark.

1079
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:46,938
I used to pee in my bed.

1080
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:51,693
I did. I wet my bed until I was 10.

1081
01:25:53,028 --> 01:25:55,822
My mother turned me over to the county...

1082
01:25:57,115 --> 01:25:58,867
when I was 10, too.

1083
01:25:59,826 --> 01:26:03,496
Not for being a bed-wetter,
but for being a bad seed.

1084
01:26:04,706 --> 01:26:07,709
Anyway, three years went by...

1085
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:10,295
and then Joe came.

1086
01:26:11,421 --> 01:26:14,132
He took me out, and I became...

1087
01:26:14,716 --> 01:26:16,843
the person that I am today.

1088
01:26:22,682 --> 01:26:23,683
Look.

1089
01:26:24,559 --> 01:26:27,187
I tried to kill myself with a Lady Bic.

1090
01:26:27,812 --> 01:26:32,192
A pink plastic razor with daisies on it
and a moisturizing strip.

1091
01:26:34,402 --> 01:26:37,614
And it took me forever
just to get through my skin.

1092
01:26:39,908 --> 01:26:43,328
I don't know.
I was just really tired of being invisible.

1093
01:26:46,956 --> 01:26:48,416
We love you, Debra.

1094
01:26:55,715 --> 01:26:57,717
Warren, get out of the store.

1095
01:26:59,344 --> 01:27:01,763
You can't tell me what to do, A.J.

1096
01:27:03,139 --> 01:27:06,851
- What are you doing with a gun?
- What do you think I'm doing?

1097
01:27:08,395 --> 01:27:09,396
What was that?

1098
01:27:09,437 --> 01:27:11,773
- Christ!
- Holy shit, man!

1099
01:27:11,856 --> 01:27:14,526
Why don't you let these people go?
What do you say?

1100
01:27:14,609 --> 01:27:18,029
Good try, A.J. You trying to fool me, man?

1101
01:27:18,113 --> 01:27:21,241
I'm not that dumb. You'll call the cops.

1102
01:27:22,075 --> 01:27:24,327
- Warren's shooting up the place.
- My God, A.J.

1103
01:27:24,411 --> 01:27:27,288
A.J.'s fine. Everybody stand back, okay?
Call 911.

1104
01:27:27,330 --> 01:27:30,500
I'm crazy and I've got a gun!

1105
01:27:30,792 --> 01:27:33,378
Do you see that, man?

1106
01:27:33,461 --> 01:27:36,798
Wasn't that brilliant? Didn't you love that?

1107
01:27:37,424 --> 01:27:40,719
You told me not to come back.
Well, here I am.

1108
01:27:40,885 --> 01:27:43,513
- Give me the gun, Warren.
- I'll give you the gun.

1109
01:27:46,016 --> 01:27:47,225
What are you doing?

1110
01:27:47,308 --> 01:27:49,436
I wanted to have a little chat with Warren.

1111
01:27:49,519 --> 01:27:51,855
Yeah? Have a little chat with my gun.

1112
01:27:52,147 --> 01:27:53,982
What do you want, Warren?

1113
01:27:54,190 --> 01:27:58,236
Stop calling me Warren!
My name isn't fucking Warren!

1114
01:27:58,486 --> 01:28:00,488
His name isn't Warren.

1115
01:28:00,530 --> 01:28:02,198
You can't kill me, Warren.

1116
01:28:02,282 --> 01:28:04,743
- I'm already dead.
- I thought his name was Warren.

1117
01:28:04,826 --> 01:28:07,412
I talked to God. She says, "Yo, what's up?"

1118
01:28:08,663 --> 01:28:10,749
And she wants you to lose the gun.

1119
01:28:10,832 --> 01:28:13,543
You are psycho!

1120
01:28:14,044 --> 01:28:16,713
What the hell is wrong with you people?

1121
01:28:16,796 --> 01:28:20,383
You all belong in the loony bin.
Every one of you.

1122
01:28:20,467 --> 01:28:22,635
Forget you guys. I don't need you.

1123
01:28:22,844 --> 01:28:26,473
You think you're so happy
and so goddamn great...

1124
01:28:26,556 --> 01:28:28,725
because you work
in a freaking record store.

1125
01:28:28,808 --> 01:28:31,394
You think you're so superior.

1126
01:28:32,395 --> 01:28:36,733
Joe, Lucas steals $9,000 from you,
and you don't do dick to him?

1127
01:28:37,150 --> 01:28:39,444
So you going to give me a job now?

1128
01:28:41,446 --> 01:28:43,198
So that's it, Warren?

1129
01:28:44,532 --> 01:28:46,659
You want to work in a record store?

1130
01:28:47,035 --> 01:28:48,036
No.

1131
01:28:48,661 --> 01:28:50,663
I think you're lying, Warren.

1132
01:28:53,083 --> 01:28:56,252
- He's not going to give me a job, man.
- How do you know?

1133
01:28:56,336 --> 01:28:59,339
Why should he?
Why should anyone give me a job?

1134
01:28:59,631 --> 01:29:01,383
He gave me a job.

1135
01:29:11,976 --> 01:29:13,728
So do I get the job?

1136
01:29:16,481 --> 01:29:20,235
Considering the fact that he's a minor
and he put blanks in the gun...

1137
01:29:20,318 --> 01:29:22,570
there's really not a lot they can do to him.

1138
01:29:22,612 --> 01:29:24,197
Thanks a lot, Officers.

1139
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:27,617
- Take care, Warren. Stay out of trouble.
- Wait a minute.

1140
01:29:30,787 --> 01:29:34,207
- Warren, I made this for you. Warren...
- Wait.

1141
01:29:34,499 --> 01:29:37,252
Can you keep it here for me?
So when I get back...

1142
01:29:37,335 --> 01:29:39,087
- Sure.
- Thanks, man.

1143
01:29:39,421 --> 01:29:43,133
Hey, Warren, take care of yourself.
Don't let the man get you down.

1144
01:29:43,341 --> 01:29:45,885
You, too, Lucas. 'Bye, Gina.

1145
01:29:46,386 --> 01:29:48,304
Yeah, don't drop the soap.

1146
01:29:49,055 --> 01:29:50,807
I got to call Mitchell.

1147
01:29:58,440 --> 01:29:59,858
It's $1,900.

1148
01:30:00,942 --> 01:30:03,403
- I sold my Vespa across the street.
- No.

1149
01:30:04,279 --> 01:30:07,949
Here's $600 left over
from the Rex Manning expense account.

1150
01:30:08,366 --> 01:30:09,409
Cool.

1151
01:30:09,617 --> 01:30:12,078
There's about $30 from Debra's buttons.

1152
01:30:13,204 --> 01:30:16,458
- I have some money in my bag.
- Here's $2...

1153
01:30:17,208 --> 01:30:19,502
and some Bazooka Joe for karma.

1154
01:30:19,586 --> 01:30:22,130
Here's $23 from A.J.'s expense account.

1155
01:30:22,464 --> 01:30:25,008
Maybe you can hock this, I don't know.

1156
01:30:27,761 --> 01:30:30,638
- That's $3,050.
- Yeah.

1157
01:30:31,431 --> 01:30:33,183
And $6 more.

1158
01:30:35,435 --> 01:30:39,356
The bold and courageous act
did not change the course of history.

1159
01:30:41,858 --> 01:30:43,318
I hate money.

1160
01:30:49,741 --> 01:30:53,286
I thought I knew what I was doing,
but I didn't, okay?

1161
01:30:54,996 --> 01:30:56,331
I give up.

1162
01:31:02,462 --> 01:31:03,838
Call Mitchell.

1163
01:31:04,339 --> 01:31:08,218
- I think we can work something out...
- No, now's the time, just call him.

1164
01:31:08,301 --> 01:31:09,636
Whoa!

1165
01:31:11,096 --> 01:31:14,099
Wait, give me a couple of seconds.

1166
01:31:16,017 --> 01:31:18,561
So the perpetrator
will be taken to Juvenile Hall...

1167
01:31:18,645 --> 01:31:21,314
and likely charged
with assault with a deadly weapon...

1168
01:31:21,398 --> 01:31:23,149
possibly even kidnapping.

1169
01:31:23,483 --> 01:31:26,361
I saw the whole thing go down.
You see, I work here.

1170
01:31:26,611 --> 01:31:29,030
Hey, guys, check it out. Mark's on TV!

1171
01:31:29,072 --> 01:31:31,366
Joining us is an eyewitness to the scene.

1172
01:31:31,449 --> 01:31:34,327
An employee of the store who saw it.
Tell us what happened.

1173
01:31:34,369 --> 01:31:37,997
This guy here kind of wigged out and all,
but that's besides the point.

1174
01:31:38,081 --> 01:31:40,250
We're having a get-together here tonight.

1175
01:31:40,333 --> 01:31:43,420
There's gonna be free admission,
live music, hits, chicks...

1176
01:31:43,503 --> 01:31:46,923
The full nine yards, man.
It'll be heavy shit. Here at midnight.

1177
01:31:47,007 --> 01:31:49,926
We're live on the air right now.
That's the story...

1178
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:53,638
Anybody can come. Here at midnight.
Party on, man!

1179
01:31:54,055 --> 01:31:56,266
Damn the man! Save the Empire!

1180
01:31:56,599 --> 01:31:59,185
You know what, Berko?
Your band can play.

1181
01:31:59,269 --> 01:32:02,689
- We can buy kegs and sell beer.
- Hey, I can sell my brownies.

1182
01:32:02,731 --> 01:32:04,190
- Brownies.
- There you go.

1183
01:32:04,232 --> 01:32:07,944
What about a permit? You need a permit
to sell beer on the street.

1184
01:32:08,278 --> 01:32:09,654
Joe, screw the permit.

1185
01:32:09,738 --> 01:32:11,698
- Yeah.
- Come on, Joe.

1186
01:32:11,781 --> 01:32:12,991
Brownies?

1187
01:32:27,922 --> 01:32:29,549
Screw the permit.

1188
01:33:03,208 --> 01:33:04,542
We've got to make some money.

1189
01:33:19,391 --> 01:33:22,769
You gotta invest in this
when you're young. A record is like life.

1190
01:33:22,811 --> 01:33:24,312
It goes around and around.

1191
01:33:25,772 --> 01:33:27,565
- How much is it?
- $80.

1192
01:33:36,825 --> 01:33:37,909
$5 a beer.

1193
01:33:38,493 --> 01:33:40,120
Plenty for everyone!

1194
01:33:40,995 --> 01:33:42,247
There you go.

1195
01:33:46,793 --> 01:33:49,295
You gotta buy something before you go in.

1196
01:33:49,671 --> 01:33:52,716
- You wanna buy some vinyl or something?
- Hi, Mitchell.

1197
01:33:54,259 --> 01:33:55,260
Joe!

1198
01:33:57,345 --> 01:33:59,222
What is going on here?

1199
01:33:59,305 --> 01:34:03,184
Why do I get the feeling
that I am being royally screwed?

1200
01:34:04,728 --> 01:34:06,604
Because you are, Mitch.

1201
01:34:07,856 --> 01:34:11,651
There was no money in the bag.
One of my employees needed it.

1202
01:34:15,155 --> 01:34:16,531
Who took it?

1203
01:34:18,074 --> 01:34:19,743
Who took my money?

1204
01:34:20,744 --> 01:34:23,913
Mitch, this is some party.
I mean it's a hell of a turn-out.

1205
01:34:23,997 --> 01:34:26,416
- Who are you?
- I'm Lucas. I still work here.

1206
01:34:26,499 --> 01:34:28,335
How could I forget. We're talking...

1207
01:34:28,376 --> 01:34:30,920
I wanted to talk to you
about this Music Town thing.

1208
01:34:31,212 --> 01:34:34,549
Next week, you'll be the owner
of one of the many Music Towns...

1209
01:34:34,632 --> 01:34:36,343
- across this great land, correct?
- Yes.

1210
01:34:36,384 --> 01:34:39,888
You like it because Music Town
raises prices, so you make more money.

1211
01:34:39,971 --> 01:34:42,891
- You're a smart boy.
- When Music Town comes in...

1212
01:34:43,016 --> 01:34:46,019
Joe is out. A.J. Is out.

1213
01:34:46,353 --> 01:34:50,607
All the beautiful little tattooed,
gum-chewing freaks are out as well.

1214
01:34:50,690 --> 01:34:53,568
And it pretty much goes
without saying, that I'm out.

1215
01:34:53,651 --> 01:34:56,571
Wish it had gone without saying,
but you won't shut up.

1216
01:34:56,654 --> 01:35:01,201
What I think Lucas is trying to say
is that I'm going to open my own store.

1217
01:35:02,952 --> 01:35:05,080
You don't have the start-up capital.

1218
01:35:05,163 --> 01:35:07,248
- Yes, he does.
- No, I don't.

1219
01:35:08,083 --> 01:35:10,710
But I will. I will get it.

1220
01:35:13,338 --> 01:35:14,547
Mitch...

1221
01:35:15,465 --> 01:35:16,675
I quit.

1222
01:35:20,512 --> 01:35:22,639
- You knew, didn't you?
- About what?

1223
01:35:22,722 --> 01:35:25,809
Everything. About me,
what I wanted to do.

1224
01:35:26,685 --> 01:35:28,687
I knew you weren't happy.

1225
01:36:37,756 --> 01:36:40,342
Thank you for coming. 'Bye. Move along.

1226
01:36:40,425 --> 01:36:43,136
These are on sale with a coupon, right?

1227
01:36:55,106 --> 01:36:57,609
Doesn't anybody work in this store?

1228
01:36:57,984 --> 01:36:59,069
I do.

1229
01:37:07,035 --> 01:37:08,745
A.J.!

1230
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:36,606
Leave the merchandise, take your cup,
get out! Bug someone outside!

1231
01:37:36,898 --> 01:37:37,982
Now!

1232
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:41,236
Here's all your money. Count it.

1233
01:37:45,073 --> 01:37:47,409
I hate this place. You love it.

1234
01:37:48,076 --> 01:37:49,911
Let me sell it to you.

1235
01:37:50,745 --> 01:37:51,871
Cheap.

1236
01:37:52,831 --> 01:37:54,958
Thanks, you won't regret it.

1237
01:37:56,167 --> 01:37:57,377
Asshole.

1238
01:37:59,671 --> 01:38:01,798
- I'll take it.
- Give me that!

1239
01:38:06,761 --> 01:38:07,804
You!

1240
01:38:08,638 --> 01:38:09,931
- Take the lead.
- What?

1241
01:38:09,973 --> 01:38:11,141
Go on.

1242
01:38:12,684 --> 01:38:14,019
You're on.

1243
01:39:12,994 --> 01:39:14,245
Perfect.

1244
01:39:16,664 --> 01:39:18,792
Well, not entirely perfect.

1245
01:39:25,465 --> 01:39:27,676
Hi. What are you doing up here?

1246
01:39:27,884 --> 01:39:29,678
- Listen to me!
- Hello, Corey.

1247
01:39:29,719 --> 01:39:32,013
You're so special and so talented!

1248
01:39:32,055 --> 01:39:34,974
You have everything it takes!
More than everything it takes!

1249
01:39:35,016 --> 01:39:38,395
And you're really stupid
because you don't know that!

1250
01:39:39,896 --> 01:39:43,441
And I know you don't love me anymore
and I know that I blew it!

1251
01:39:43,525 --> 01:39:45,402
And if you don't go to art school...

1252
01:39:45,485 --> 01:39:49,280
if you don't understand how special
you are, then you know nothing.

1253
01:39:51,783 --> 01:39:54,035
I did love you and I still...

1254
01:39:54,119 --> 01:39:57,247
Only I didn't realize it was love
because it was more than love...

1255
01:39:57,330 --> 01:40:00,500
and it wasn't just some stupid feeling
in my stomach.

1256
01:40:00,875 --> 01:40:03,586
I'll never love anybody as much as you.

1257
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:05,922
And I hate you! Why did you wait so long?

1258
01:40:06,006 --> 01:40:07,173
I quit.

1259
01:40:10,593 --> 01:40:12,637
I'm going to art school...

1260
01:40:13,596 --> 01:40:15,015
in Boston...

1261
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:17,434
so I can be near you.

1262
01:40:19,978 --> 01:40:21,521
- Really?
- Yeah.

1263
01:43:44,099 --> 01:43:46,685
That guy, whatever his name is.

1264
01:43:47,185 --> 01:43:48,812
What's his name?

1265
01:43:49,104 --> 01:43:52,065
That dude with the shaved head?
The liar guy?

1266
01:43:52,607 --> 01:43:55,318
- Henry Rollins?
- Yes, the guy with tattoos all over.

1267
01:43:55,402 --> 01:43:57,570
I admit, Henry Rollins is sort of a puss.

1268
01:43:57,612 --> 01:44:00,198
Yeah, he's a total puss. His lyrics suck.

1269
01:44:00,281 --> 01:44:03,159
But you can't go and put down the Misfits.

1270
01:44:03,535 --> 01:44:06,329
They had everything it took
to be a great punk band.

1271
01:44:06,413 --> 01:44:09,958
They had good bass lines
and strong guitar chords...

1272
01:44:10,041 --> 01:44:11,793
even though they were only three.

1273
01:44:11,876 --> 01:44:16,548
They didn't even compare to Primus.
They were that old school stuff.

1274
01:44:16,673 --> 01:44:18,466
Why get into Primus?

1275
01:44:18,508 --> 01:44:21,177
- Primus sucks.
- Primus is the new stuff.

1276
01:44:21,261 --> 01:44:23,138
Out with the old, in with the new.

1277
01:44:23,221 --> 01:44:26,516
Religion's a bad thing if Primus
is what's gonna come around.

1278
01:44:26,599 --> 01:44:30,395
- What are you talking about?
- The fact that Primus has nothing.

1279
01:44:30,478 --> 01:44:32,856
They got good bass lines. I'll admit.

1280
01:44:32,939 --> 01:44:35,442
They have beautiful bass lines.
Six-string fretless bass...

1281
01:44:35,483 --> 01:44:37,944
Okay, but they're not
as good as the Pixies.

1282
01:44:37,986 --> 01:44:42,157
The Pixies have way better bass lines
than Primus.

1283
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:44,576
So why didn't they stick around?

1284
01:44:44,659 --> 01:44:48,580
Because people wanted to do solo careers
and explore themselves...

1285
01:44:48,663 --> 01:44:51,499
as single entities instead of a band.

1286
01:44:51,583 --> 01:44:54,210
But that's like money.

1287
01:44:54,336 --> 01:44:57,172
No, it's not about money.
What are you talking about, "money"?

1288
01:44:57,213 --> 01:44:58,590
Yeah, it is.

1289
01:45:01,343 --> 01:45:04,346
When you've got a band together...

1290
01:45:04,429 --> 01:45:06,431
and everything's going fine...
