1
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:33,332
# Sun's up, uh-huh, looks OK #

2
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:36,164
# The world survives into another day #

3
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:39,000
# And I'm thinking about eternity #

4
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,839
# Some kind of ecstasy
has got a hold on me #

5
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,845
# I had another dream
about the lions at the door #

6
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,506
# They weren't half as frightening #

7
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,014
# As they were before #

8
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,677
# But I'm thinking about eternity #

9
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:55,518
# Some kind of ecstasy
has got a hold on me #

10
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,352
# I'm wondering where the lions are #

11
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,857
# Wondering where the lions are #

12
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,519
# I'm wondering where the lions are #

13
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,027
# Wondering where the lions are #

14
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,689
# I'm wondering where the lions are #

15
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,197
# Wondering where the lions are #

16
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,892
# Mmm #

17
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:14,362
Of the last six places I've lived,
Montana was the best.

18
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:19,367
The snow-covered peaks,
the rolling valleys, the beautiful rivers...

19
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:23,872
For the first time in my life,
I felt like I was home.

20
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,215
Then Dad dropped the bomb...

21
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:30,416
We were moving again,
all the way to Florida.

22
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,223
# I'm wondering where the lions are #

23
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,728
# Wondering where the lions are #

24
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,560
# I'm wondering where the lions are #

25
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,065
# Wondering where the lions are #

26
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,897
# I'm wondering where the lions are #

27
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,402
# Wondering where the lions are #

28
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,563
# Mmm #

29
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:49,735
# Freighters on the nod
on the surface of the bay #

30
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,404
# One of these days
we're going to sail away #

31
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,073
# Going to sail into eternity #

32
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,744
# Some kind of ecstasy
has got a hold on me #

33
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,582
# And I'm wondering where the lions are #

34
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,087
# Wondering where the lions are #

35
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,919
# I'm wondering where the lions are #

36
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,424
# Wondering where the lions are #

37
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,255
# I'm wondering where the lions are #

38
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,760
# Wondering where the lions are #

39
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,592
# Mmm #

40
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,928
Mom said it was
so sunny and gorgeous...

41
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,594
that everybody in America
wanted to live there.

42
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,933
Everybody except me.

43
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,341
And as usual, I was out-voted.

44
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:25,778
My parents gave me the same old pitch
about being the new kid in school.

45
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,280
Mom said I'd make
lots of new friends.

46
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,805
They promised I would love it there.

47
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,010
Whoa. Get him, dude!

48
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,279
Aah!

49
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,117
Had enough, huh, cowgirl?

50
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,384
Hmm? Had enough?

51
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,254
Yeah.

52
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:40,452
Aah!

53
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,484
I can't hear you, Tex.

54
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:43,757
Unh! Unh!

55
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,169
Unh!

56
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,574
Aah!

57
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:03,980
Had enough... Tex?

58
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,644
Yeah. OK?

59
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,152
I've had enough. Aah!

60
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,054
Allow me to be the first to welcome you
to Coconut Cove.

61
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,487
Awesome.

62
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,323
Yeah.

63
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,522
Who's the bad man now?

64
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,191
Who? Who?

65
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,198
One-Baker-six responding.

66
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,842
We're getting a Mother Paula's here.

67
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,010
How about that?

68
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,020
About time you showed up.

69
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,681
Oh, yeah, sorry.

70
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,691
I was dealing with a 443
over on Twelfth Street...

71
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,023
that eventually turned into a 961.

72
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,858
Took me a little while to button it up.

73
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,022
Uh-huh.

74
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:55,057
Don't you, uh, want to know
what a 443 is?

75
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:56,534
No, I do not.

76
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,367
I want you to deal with what we got
going on over here.

77
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,429
OK.

78
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,998
They yanked up all my survey stakes.

79
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,067
Filled them in, every last one of them.

80
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:08,103
They must've snuck in late last night
or early this morning.

81
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:11,913
OK, can you at least give me
a monetary estimate on the damage done?

82
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,543
What are you talkin' about?

83
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,077
Sir, in order for it to be vandalism...

84
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:17,885
there has to be some kind
of monetary damage.

85
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,721
Like, something has to be
broken or defaced.

86
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,751
Otherwise, l... I don't know what
to tell you about your stakes.

87
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,229
It ain't about the darn stakes!

88
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,894
It's screwin' up our entire
construction schedule.

89
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:33,031
I've got to resurvey the whole site
before we can start clearin' and gradin'.

90
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,562
Sir, I copy that...

91
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,404
and I'm gonna keep
my eyes and my ears open...

92
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,069
and I'm gonna talk
to my people on the streets...

93
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,476
and try and get it figured out.

94
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:40,740
Whatever.

95
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,749
Well, sir, like I said,
I'm gonna do the best I can, OK?

96
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,478
Fine.

97
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:46,746
Ow.

98
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,151
What's the deal with these holes?

99
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:49,916
They're holes, all right?

100
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,447
Now come on.
I ain't got all day.

101
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,762
Every new school is different...

102
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,772
but somehow they always seem the same.

103
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,602
And day one was never my favorite.

104
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,111
Good job, Nancy.

105
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,841
Excellent, Zack. All right.

106
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,781
And that was a great job
with Chapter 5...

107
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,614
which logically leads us to Chapter 6...

108
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,621
Tectonic Plates and the Ocean Floor.

109
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,452
I hope we all have our books.

110
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,458
We can open them to Chapter 6.

111
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,686
Yes?

112
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:32,960
You must be Mr. Eberhardt from...

113
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,398
let me guess.

114
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,197
Montana.

115
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,032
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

116
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,631
Welcome to Marine Studies.
I'm Mr. Ryan. Have a seat.

117
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:41,799
Thanks.

118
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,138
Where was I?

119
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,474
Chapter 6... Ocean Topography.

120
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,001
- Howdy, partner.
- He looks like Woody from <i>Toy Story.</i>

121
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,475
Hey...

122
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,984
l... I saw what happened
on the bus this morning.

123
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,646
Don't take it personally or anything.

124
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,348
Dana screws with all the new kids.

125
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:00,382
Just play dead for the next couple days,
and eventually he'll forget you're alive.

126
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,623
- I'm Garrett.
- Roy.

127
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,156
Six schools in the last eight years?

128
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,327
What are you?

129
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,337
In the witness protection program
or something?

130
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,838
Funny, nah.

131
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,340
My... My dad's work makes us
move around a lot.

132
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,208
Hey, are there any other
schools around here?

133
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,337
Why? You sick of this one already?

134
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,677
No, no.

135
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:25,013
Just, I saw this weird kid
on the way to school today...

136
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,019
and I don't see him around here...

137
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,487
so I figured he must not go to Trace.

138
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,184
He... He was running like crazy
with no shoes on.

139
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,853
Fast. Faster than any kid
I've ever seen before.

140
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,522
You've already got a psycho bully
on your hands.

141
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,361
You know, m-maybe you want to
slow down on the nut-job collecting.

142
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,061
Plus, you know, it's only day one.

143
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,212
# All the cool kids
in the back of the bus #

144
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,877
# Rubba dubba scrubba bubba #

145
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,715
# What you talkin' 'bout, Gus? #

146
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,880
# Breakin' the rules,
I hope we don't get caught #

147
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,390
# Sha la la la la la la la la #

148
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,393
Sweet threads.

149
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,724
Thanks.

150
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,729
Oh, yeah.

151
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,663
Oh, n-n-noogie!

152
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:15,292
Hey, man. Looks like today
might be your lucky day.

153
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,087
Oh, where you going, cowgirl?

154
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,457
No, Dana, let go. I gotta go.

155
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:43,325
Oh, hold up here, cowgirl.
You're my little puppet.

156
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:45,330
Dance, little tomato.

157
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,161
- Dance.
- Aah!

158
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,963
Unh!

159
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:51,265
Aah!

160
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,771
Hah...

161
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,136
No way.

162
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,107
Excuse me. Gotta go.
Out of the way.

163
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,201
- Unh!
- Watch it!

164
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:59,939
He broke my nose! It hurts!

165
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,310
Hey, slow down!

166
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,457
# Everybody get on your feet #

167
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,794
# You make me nervous
when you're in your seat #

168
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:22,028
# Take of your shoes
and pat your feet #

169
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,831
# Doin' a dance that can't be beat #

170
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,303
# Barefootin' #

171
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,464
Wait up!

172
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,803
# We're barefootin' #

173
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,467
Where are you going?

174
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,875
# Barefootin' #

175
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,845
# Yeah, we're barefootin' #

176
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,564
- Hey, there's a kid.
- Fore!

177
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,658
- Fore!
- Fore!

178
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,963
- Fore!
- Fore!

179
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,164
Oh, you hit him.

180
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,504
What club'd you use?

181
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,531
Eight iron.

182
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:07,742
You all right?

183
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:12,342
Honey, it's only your second day.

184
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,682
This isn't like you.

185
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,947
Why'd you punch this kid?

186
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:18,923
He was choking me to death,
and I was just trying to get free.

187
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,220
Well, you broke his nose.

188
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:25,927
Well, they're not gonna let you
ride the bus for three days.

189
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,364
I'll ride my bike.

190
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,594
That's not the point.

191
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,033
I discussed this with your principal...

192
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,697
and we decided you're going
to write this kid a letter of apology.

193
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,399
You gotta be kidding me.

194
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,032
Who's gonna help him read it?

195
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,872
Heh, heh...

196
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,411
You nearly knocked me over yesterday.

197
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,218
Why were you running?

198
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,316
Look, I think it's because
I just broke the nose...

199
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,383
of the meanest kid in school.

200
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,827
Oh, I heard all about it, cowgirl,
but that's not why you ran off, was it?

201
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,121
- Just... let go.
- Tell the truth.

202
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,292
Ow.

203
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,631
You were chasing somebody, weren't you?

204
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,761
You saw him, too?
The kid with no shoes?

205
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,897
Oh, I didn't see anything.

206
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:10,500
And if you know what's good for you,
neither did you. Got it?

207
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,740
Mornin'. How you doin'?

208
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,875
Now this time,
I got some actual vandalism to report.

209
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,078
All right.

210
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,246
This time they messed
with private property.

211
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,312
There you go.

212
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:26,416
Each one of them tires is worth 150 bucks.

213
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,154
They slashed my sidewalls.

214
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,924
Yeah, uh...

215
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,590
I don't think these tires were slashed.

216
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,930
I think they were just, uh...

217
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,561
- De-inflated.
- De-inflated?

218
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:40,401
Yeah, I'll write up a report on it.

219
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:41,770
Write a report?

220
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:42,831
- Yes, sir.
- Why don't y'all...

221
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,934
just put on some extra patrols out here.

222
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,444
Now look... l... I'll talk to my captain.

223
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,003
Did they mess with anything else?

224
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,777
There ain't nothin' else out here
to mess with.

225
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,943
You, uh, you check out these toilets yet?

226
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,977
Well, sure,
but they ain't near as comfortable...

227
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,284
as the ones we got in the trailer.

228
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,520
Yeah, l... I meant for vandalism.

229
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,260
You wanna go pokin' your head
in the potty, be my guest.

230
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,831
What are you doin' up there?

231
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,966
Listenin'.

232
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,644
Listenin' to what?

233
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,644
Just step away from the potty, please, sir.

234
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,014
Step away.

235
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:37,818
Aah!

236
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,160
Ohh! Oof!

237
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,665
Unh...

238
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,191
Oh, come on now,
it don't smell that bad.

239
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,339
Ehh..."Dear Dana...

240
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,934
"I promise not to hit you ever again as long
as you don't bother me on the school bus.

241
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,910
"I think that's a fair arrangement.

242
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:56,540
"Most sincerely, Roy A. Eberhardt."

243
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,014
So what'd you guys think?

244
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,044
Sincere enough?

245
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:11,189
Honey, if he's such a big bully,
isn't the note a little forceful?

246
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,357
The kid was choking me, Mom...

247
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,026
I'm not gonna write him a love letter.

248
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,093
Look, this is what happens
when you're the new kid.

249
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,037
Come on, Roy,
I'm the new kid at work.

250
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,336
You don't see me
getting into fist fights at the office.

251
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:23,363
No offense, Dad...

252
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,377
but you don't have to ride
the school bus to work.

253
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,571
Just...

254
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:29,581
Just let me know
when we're moving again.

255
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,285
# Florida, I know ya #

256
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,886
# I'll be hidin' from me... #

257
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,055
There were a total of six gators, sir.

258
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,031
The largest being four feet even...

259
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:50,593
the smallest being, uh... 24 inches.

260
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,934
Eh, probably just a bunch of kids
screwin' around.

261
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,633
Well, that was my original assumption...

262
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,800
but with all due respect,
Captain, I mean...

263
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:59,970
h-how many kids do you know
that could handle a four-foot alligator?

264
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:02,674
I think we're dealing
with, uh, you know...

265
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:05,582
with a maybe more
sophisticated syndicate...

266
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:09,384
you know, somebody that really has it in
for, uh, Mother Paula's...

267
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:13,380
you know, possibly a... a revenge type deal.

268
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,950
- Revenge?
- Yes.

269
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:19,897
Like, you know, a... a rival pancake house.

270
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:22,628
That's a great piece of police work,
Officer Delinko.

271
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:23,760
And then also l...

272
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,997
Hey, look, Sherlock...

273
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:28,473
there are no other pancake houses
in Coconut Cove.

274
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,634
I got the mayor calling me about...

275
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:32,803
"Coconut Cove's economy
needs Mother Paula's."

276
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:37,612
So, go rub those two little brain cells
of yours together...

277
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,277
then get out there and catch the punks...

278
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,582
that are messin'
with that construction site.

279
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,611
No need to worry, sir, I am on the case.

280
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,283
I'm all over it.

281
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,689
That's precisely what I'm worried about.

282
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,463
Nobody in the history
of Trace Middle School...

283
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,799
has ever hit a Matherson before.

284
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,805
- You're a legend already.
- Look...

285
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,966
Look, I'm glad I can
make my mark on history.

286
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,407
OK, look... Iook, I wrote him a note
and that should be the end of it.

287
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,809
A note?
That's adorable.

288
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,972
What'd you say?

289
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,105
"Sorry I smoked you...

290
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,979
"please don't break every bone in my body.

291
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,484
"Please leave me one good arm
so I can feed myself."

292
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,146
You're hysterical.

293
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,176
We've got a game to win.

294
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,484
Let's be a team for once.

295
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,990
What do you know about
that girl over there?

296
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,582
That's Beatrice the Bear.

297
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,462
Please don't tell me
you messed with her, too.

298
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:27,158
What is it with you, man?
I mean, seriously?

299
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,327
She jumped all over me for some reason,
I'm just tryin' to figure out why.

300
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,529
What's her story?

301
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,164
She's a major soccer jock with attitude.

302
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:37,004
First Dana Matherson,
now Beatrice the Bear...

303
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,374
You must have a serious death wish, bro.

304
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:48,820
Officer David Delinko,
case number 0-niner-0...

305
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:52,085
Codename... Flapjack.

306
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,682
The time is now...

307
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,854
03:56.

308
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,864
Still no sound.

309
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,866
Still no visuals.

310
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,368
Just me and the night.

311
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,205
A Ione wolf...

312
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,207
stalking his prey.

313
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,294
Ho!

314
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,103
OK...

315
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,742
Whew.

316
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,547
OK, everything's under control.

317
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:56,748
Everything's OK.

318
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:03,786
So as to adapt my vision
to the nighttime visibility conditions...

319
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:10,098
uh, I will now close my eyes
for a few brief seconds.

320
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,793
One-Baker-six, what's your twenty?

321
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,454
I repeat, what's your twenty?

322
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:44,163
This is one-Baker-six, my twenty is,
uh, East Oriole and, uh...

323
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,829
Uhh... police officer!

324
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,134
Police officer!

325
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,299
Oh, yeah?

326
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,968
You could've fooled me.

327
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,637
Ain't you heard me knockin'?

328
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,476
What time is it?

329
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,981
About 8:30.

330
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,177
You gonna want to see this.

331
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,016
This one about beats the band.

332
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,419
Oh, no...

333
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,018
Oh, no...

334
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,654
Oh! No!

335
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,358
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

336
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,661
No, my cruiser!

337
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,827
Your cruiser?
Forget about your car.

338
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,337
They yanked up
all my darn stakes again.

339
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,168
- Uhh...
- Hey!

340
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,673
Buddy...

341
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,403
My stakes!

342
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:30,641
I knew I couldn't spend the rest of the year
hiding from Beatrice the Bear...

343
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:34,880
so even if it meant getting decapitated
with my lunch tray, I had to take a stand.

344
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,882
What is your problem?

345
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:39,288
I think you're the one
with the problem.

346
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:40,848
- Uh?
- Ohh...

347
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:45,523
Beatrice, I have no idea why you're mad
about what happened on the bus...

348
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,054
because you're not the one
who got choked...

349
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,329
and you're not the one
who got punched in the nose.

350
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:52,701
So, if I did something to upset you,
then I'm sorry.

351
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,228
It wasn't on purpose.

352
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:57,674
So next time you have a problem,
just tell me...

353
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:00,143
and we can sit down
and talk about it...

354
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,706
like civilized human beings, OK?

355
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,046
Civilized?

356
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,918
Are we straight on this?

357
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,315
Good, then I'm glad we had this chance...

358
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,258
to get to know each other
just a little bit better.

359
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,587
He's kinda cute, don't you think?

360
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,361
- Ha ha.
- Ha.

361
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,926
In a way that's not cute at all.

362
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,250
Sure you don't want me to come with you?

363
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,950
Just keep the engine running.

364
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,901
Hi, is Dana home?

365
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:05,068
Who are you?

366
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,168
I go to school with him.

367
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,101
Dana!

368
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,279
<i>Dana!</i>

369
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,806
What?

370
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,113
Get over here.

371
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,150
I am not believing this.

372
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,659
Hi, I just came by to give you something.

373
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,524
It's... it's a letter.

374
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,029
Um, so, who are you again?

375
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:30,296
I'm Roy, the one your son
tried to strangle to death the other day.

376
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,599
The one who slugged him in the nose.

377
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,765
You gotta be kiddin' me.

378
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:37,434
This little twerp's the one who messed up
your beautiful face?

379
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,341
Yeah, Mommy.

380
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,816
Look, l... I came by
to apologize, ma'am.

381
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,011
It's all in the letter.

382
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,316
Let me see that.

383
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,982
Me and you will settle up
when I get back to school.

384
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,959
Uh, actually, this letter
is supposed to settle us.

385
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,996
Me and you are a long way from settled.

386
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,365
Now get lost, cowgirl.

387
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,003
Dana...
Give me that!

388
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,035
No, not... gimme!

389
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,707
I need to read what that says!

390
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,579
What if it's a death threat!

391
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,551
Come on!

392
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,918
God!

393
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,389
They're both rather odd, aren't they?

394
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:26,823
Yes, they are.

395
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:30,692
Maybe I should go and introduce myself.

396
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,094
You're not funny.

397
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,563
Start the car.

398
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:37,290
Will you please just give me...

399
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:38,598
- I want the letter.
- Stop it!

400
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,702
After getting whacked by that ball...

401
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,039
I wasn't really thrilled about going back
to the golf course.

402
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,545
But that was the last place
I'd seen the barefoot kid...

403
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,774
and I wanted to find out
what he was up to.

404
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,396
Hello?

405
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,488
Anybody here?

406
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,274
Aah!

407
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:24,612
This is not good.

408
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,641
I wouldn't move, if I were you.

409
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:29,313
I wasn't planning on it,
not with cottonmouths.

410
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:32,016
I want you to step backwards real slowly.

411
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,319
On three...

412
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:34,985
- One...
- I don't think so.

413
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,790
- Two...
- No way!

414
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,659
Three.

415
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:39,994
Three!

416
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,155
Uh!

417
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,667
Ahh!

418
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:44,691
Uh! Hey!

419
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,067
What are you doing? Uh!

420
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:47,332
Who are you and why are you here?

421
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:48,532
Name's Roy.

422
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:51,167
Look, I saw you run
by the school bus the other day.

423
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,540
I didn't come out here to hassle you.

424
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,477
I just want to talk.

425
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:56,572
You're gonna have to get out of here
like right now.

426
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:57,604
Ahh!

427
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,638
- Now let's go.
- Ahh!

428
00:21:58,684 --> 00:21:59,878
All right. All right.

429
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:01,783
Why do you have
poisonous snakes in a bag?

430
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,221
That's my business,
so just leave me alone.

431
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:07,452
Where are you taking me?

432
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,791
Keep walking and don't turn around
till you count to fifty.

433
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,956
You come 'round here again,
you're gonna wake up one mornin'...

434
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:17,094
with one of them big old cottonmouths
in your bed, all right?

435
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,968
Now start counting.

436
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,064
Ahh, one, two...

437
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,974
three, four...

438
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,341
five...

439
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,437
six...

440
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:30,470
seven...

441
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,504
Eight...

442
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,848
nine, ten...

443
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:37,252
ahh, forget it.

444
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,615
Fore!

445
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:40,716
Fore, kid!

446
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:43,852
Uh!

447
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:45,157
That hurt.

448
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:51,795
Hey, Mom.

449
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,134
Hmm?

450
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:56,163
Is it illegal for a kid my age
not to go to school?

451
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,073
Well, I don't know
if it's an actual law, but...

452
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,304
Oh, yes, it is.

453
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:01,073
Truancy's what it's called.

454
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,576
I bet I know what this is really about...

455
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:07,084
and I told you that that letter
was too assertive.

456
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,587
Oh, the letter was just fine.

457
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:10,952
Listen to this...

458
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:12,581
"A Coconut Cove police cruiser...

459
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:15,718
"was vandalized early Monday morning
while parked at a construction site...

460
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:19,390
"when an unknown prankster
spray-painted the car's windows black...

461
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,422
"while the officer slept inside.

462
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:24,060
"There have been three incidents
within in a week at this location...

463
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:26,866
"the future home of Mother Paula's
All-American Pancake House."

464
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,873
Oh, we're getting
a Mother Paula's here.

465
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,204
That'll be nice.

466
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,039
Hey, Dad, can I see the newspaper
for a second?

467
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,442
Mm-hmm.

468
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:35,139
Thank you.

469
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:48,558
You'll notice that
your name wasn't mentioned.

470
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,426
That's because we refused
to release it to the media.

471
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:52,725
Thank you.

472
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,595
I'm really sorry about this, sir...

473
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:57,932
and... and l... l... I assure you that
it will not happen again.

474
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,527
- Oh, you bet it won't...
- No.

475
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:02,199
Because if it does,
your name will be in the paper...

476
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,540
under the headline
"Officer Terminated"!

477
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:07,943
Do you copy?

478
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,708
I copy, Captain.

479
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:16,611
Ah, so now,
wh... what about my cruiser?

480
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:18,987
Ahh, oh, I think I've got the perfect set...

481
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:22,425
of replacement wheels for you.
Ha ha ha.

482
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,294
That looks like a small key.

483
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,594
She's all yours.

484
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,463
Don't forget to plug her in.

485
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,765
Ha ha ha.

486
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,567
Ha ha ha.

487
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:35,595
Ahh!

488
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,540
Sir, ha ha ha.

489
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:38,600
Sweet ride, Delinko.

490
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,270
Heh heh heh.

491
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,815
Ah, ha ha ha.

492
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:51,152
After reading in the paper
about the gators and all the other stuff...

493
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:53,214
I couldn't help but wonder
if the barefoot kid...

494
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,624
was involved with what was going on.

495
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,458
So I thought I'd check out the lot
for myself.

496
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,206
Hey, little guys.

497
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,049
What are you doin' here?

498
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,823
What do you and your punk friends
got planned for tonight?

499
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,088
What? Nothing.

500
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:35,062
That's right!

501
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,499
You better run!

502
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,935
Run, you little bugger!

503
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,995
Don't you ever come back!

504
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,038
Here's the stuff you wanted.

505
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:55,610
I also made my special
banana-mango loaf.

506
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:57,383
Special? Tuh!

507
00:25:57,422 --> 00:26:00,448
I don't think I'd feed that to a gator.

508
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,549
Kidding.

509
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,289
You know I love your cooking.

510
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,923
You know, you... you can't stay
out here alone forever.

511
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,595
Was there anybody looking for me?

512
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:13,297
No, not yet.

513
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:16,068
But I can only cover for you for so long
before you're gonna get caught.

514
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,301
I know.

515
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:18,934
And I've been tryin' to stay out of sight...

516
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:21,571
but I've only got a few days left
to stop them.

517
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:24,104
Hello! Hello!

518
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,982
That's that kid that's been
following me around.

519
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:28,576
Don't worry.

520
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,281
I'll keep him out of your hair.

521
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,290
We are not done discussing this.

522
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:33,484
Right.

523
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,140
Hello!

524
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:07,116
Hello!

525
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,183
Look, I'm not here to hassle you.

526
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:15,356
My bike!

527
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:20,960
Looking for this?

528
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:23,432
That's my bike.

529
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,273
Yeah, it is.
Now hop on.

530
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,142
What?

531
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,670
The handle bars,
get on the handle bars, you dork.

532
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:31,773
We're going for a ride.

533
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:43,616
# From the beginning... #

534
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:44,959
Ow!

535
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,964
# I was wishing that
our first impressions #

536
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,761
# Wouldn't last #

537
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,298
# But then you came to me... #

538
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,361
Ow!

539
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:54,929
# With something that was nothing #

540
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,304
# And you kept coming back, boy... #

541
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,309
- What's in your backpack?
- What? Nothing.

542
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,709
Oh! Can I get off now?

543
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:01,871
Sure, when you tell me
what's in the box.

544
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:02,937
Nothing.

545
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,312
Come on, cowgirl.
Give it up.

546
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,317
- What's in the box?
- Shoes.

547
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,875
Yeah, sure.

548
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,887
I swear!

549
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:16,223
Why are carrying around
an old pair of sneakers?

550
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:19,526
That is weird, cowgirl, really weird.

551
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:21,623
They're not for me,
they're for this barefoot kid I met.

552
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:23,327
Maybe he doesn't want shoes.

553
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,495
Did you ever think about that?

554
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,434
Why do you care so much
about this kid anyway?

555
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:31,271
I don't know, OK?

556
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:32,833
He looked like he needed help.

557
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,274
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

558
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:39,613
I'll make sure that the barefoot kid
gets these sneakers.

559
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:40,640
Now get out of here.

560
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:42,983
So you do know him.

561
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:45,012
Well, who is he?

562
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,216
You won't leave it alone.

563
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:53,027
Can I trust you?

564
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,053
Of course.

565
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,527
He's my brother.

566
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,264
Well, my stepbrother.

567
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,169
Why doesn't he live with you?

568
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:04,369
My stepmom shipped him off
to some military school.

569
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,707
He lasted two days and then ran off.

570
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:10,943
He hitchhiked back all the way
from Mobile, Alabama.

571
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:13,348
Nobody else knows that he's here
and nobody's gonna tell them, right?

572
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:15,784
Not me.

573
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,755
About four years ago...

574
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,690
when my dad was still
playing pro basketball...

575
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:22,352
he went to this celebrity golf tournament...

576
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:24,156
where he met some cheerleader
named Lana.

577
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:27,426
At the wedding, she shows up with a son
that she didn't seem to like at all.

578
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,626
She didn't even like her own son?

579
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:32,397
I'm the only one
he even talks to anymore.

580
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,769
What's his name?

581
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:36,569
I call him Mullet Fingers.

582
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,670
Mullet Fingers?

583
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:41,736
Why?

584
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,112
I think you've heard enough for one day.

585
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:45,741
Besides, it's getting late.

586
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,581
Yeah...

587
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,951
Looks like I'm gonna be late for dinner.

588
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,181
Here's your excuse.

589
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,663
Look like you could use a lift.

590
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:10,901
Why don't you throw your bike
in the back and hop on in.

591
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:12,807
- Thank you, sir.
- You got it.

592
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:17,142
Yep, there you go.

593
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,878
Won't you go ahead
and buckle up for me.

594
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,819
One-Baker-six,
one-Baker-six, come in.

595
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,225
Sorry, I just got a little police business...

596
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:31,853
I got to tend to.
- Whoo-hoo!

597
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:33,488
Go for one-Baker-six.

598
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:37,365
Did you pick up
the captain's dry cleaning yet?

599
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,199
10-4 on that.

600
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:45,131
Yeah, this is, uh,
just kind of a temporary arrangement.

601
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,371
What's your name, son?

602
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:49,380
I'm Roy, Roy Eberhardt.

603
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:50,904
Can I ask you something, Roy?

604
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:52,246
Now you go to Trace, right?

605
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:55,116
You every hear any chatter
about stuff that's been happening...

606
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:57,644
at the new pancake house
that's going up?

607
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:01,819
No, but I saw the newspaper
about the police car getting painted.

608
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:06,659
Well, police officers
aren't superheroes, Roy...

609
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:10,156
and a stakeout can be a real test of focus
for any good lawman.

610
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,034
Even for a cop as good
as that cop was.

611
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:16,529
Ahh, you see how I'm looking
at you right now...

612
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:18,769
Like this?
You see these eyes?

613
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,711
Police work requires focus, Roy. Uh!

614
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:23,646
- Watch it!
- Uh, ahh!

615
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,148
And...

616
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:29,244
extreme tiger-like reflexes,
like the ones I just exhibited.

617
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:30,549
Whew.

618
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:33,913
You OK?

619
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,227
Yeah, I'm fine.

620
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:40,524
Don't they smell delicious?

621
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,590
You bet they do.

622
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:45,535
Pancakes don't just feed the stomach...

623
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,559
Take seven.

624
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:48,663
Don't they smell...

625
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,435
Of course, they do.

626
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:51,942
- I'm sorry.
- And action.

627
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:55,673
They feed the soul.
Ah-choo!

628
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:57,146
- Marker.
- No, you look great.

629
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:58,170
- You look great.
- OK.

630
00:31:58,216 --> 00:31:59,205
OK, it's sliding.

631
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,775
And... freeze.

632
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:03,343
Not good.

633
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:05,185
I thought it was OK.

634
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:07,521
We'll have to re-shoot this whole thing
before we hit the road.

635
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:10,322
I don't want to go to Wherever, Florida.

636
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:12,329
These opening are getting old, Chuck.

637
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:14,888
Really? Getting paid
to dress up as Mother Paula...

638
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,525
and do almost nothing,
that's getting old?

639
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:17,727
I didn't say that.

640
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,827
You keep this up,
you'll be back...

641
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,531
dancing on a cruise ship
where I found you.

642
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:24,735
Well, good luck finding somebody else
who'll put up with this stupid job, Mister.

643
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,936
Ahem, Mr. Muckle.

644
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,435
I have Coconut Cove on line five.

645
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:29,605
Thank you, Felix.

646
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:33,845
Which means you should go get packed,
'cause you're going to Florida.

647
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,855
Mr. Brannit, what does
one hundred pancake houses...

648
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:40,880
sound like to you?

649
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:44,224
Sounds like an awful lot
of pancake houses, Mr. Muckle.

650
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:46,890
It's a record-breaking accomplishment.

651
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:51,868
I will be the first regional manager
in the history of Mother Paula's...

652
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:55,100
to reach one hundred pancake houses.

653
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,164
And that is the stuff...

654
00:32:57,208 --> 00:33:01,201
that food and beverage industry legends
are made of.

655
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:04,874
Ahh, it is my dream.

656
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:07,749
And you, Mr. Brannit, are responsible...

657
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:11,949
for making a tiny piece
of that very big dream come true.

658
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,979
Gotcha.

659
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:16,323
So then why are we behind schedule,
over budget...

660
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:19,091
and on the front page
of the crime report?

661
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,791
Well, we got us a...

662
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,495
a tiny bit of a trespassing problem, sir.

663
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:25,866
Well, solve the problem...

664
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:27,996
or I will replace you
with someone who can.

665
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,141
What about them owls?

666
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,609
What owls?

667
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:36,238
Well, you know, the ones
we got in the little...

668
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,440
holes and...

669
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:42,886
This time, at half speed, Brannit,
ignore owls or lose job.

670
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,785
I want you to go out
and get what it takes...

671
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:46,756
to keep those vandals off my lot.

672
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:49,157
Attack dogs, Rottweilers, Dobermans...

673
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,821
I don't care, just get that site cleared.

674
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,353
Yes, sir.

675
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,198
You sure them dogs will do the trick?

676
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:05,709
Oh, please.

677
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:09,702
It's best you get
as far away as possible.

678
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:11,180
All right. All right.

679
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,683
Just look a little tame to me.

680
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,049
I ain't paying top dollar...

681
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:18,021
just for them to sit around slobbering,
eating tenderloins.

682
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,149
Sic him.

683
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:22,489
All right. All right.

684
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:24,017
Call them off.

685
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,690
All right, call them off.

686
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,164
- Off!
- Call them off!

687
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,929
- Off! Off!
- Hey! Hey!

688
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:32,265
Hey, all right!

689
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:34,032
All right! All right!

690
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,006
Here, you can go now.

691
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,837
Not to worry...

692
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:41,038
the dogs will take care of all
of your problems by the morning.

693
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,104
Yeah.
Come, boys, come.

694
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:44,273
Come, babies.

695
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:51,949
Whoa!

696
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,020
Easy.

697
00:34:58,062 --> 00:34:59,723
Ahh, no, no.

698
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:15,504
Hi, Dana.

699
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:16,672
Hey, cowgirl.

700
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:20,616
You and me got some business
to settle, Eberhardt.

701
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:22,016
What business?

702
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:25,352
I gave you an apology.
That makes us even.

703
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:27,983
We're a long way from even,
you and me.

704
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:29,788
You're gonna be sorry
you ever messed with me.

705
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:32,819
I am going to be your worst nightmare.

706
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:35,890
Aah!

707
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:41,330
- Uh!
- Unh!

708
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,146
What are you staring at?

709
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,841
Hey, Beatrice.

710
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,012
Unh!

711
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:55,279
Please, don't hurt me.

712
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,253
Ta-aah! Aah!

713
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:04,521
What happened?

714
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:07,360
Spooked, they got spooked.
That's what happened.

715
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:09,366
Spooked?
How'd they get spooked?

716
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,992
They're supposed to be
doing the spookin'.

717
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:13,765
There's only one thing
that spooks a dog like this...

718
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:15,203
snakes.

719
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:18,805
We ain't got no snakes 'round here.

720
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:19,969
Oh, you've got 'em.

721
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,502
You got 'em crawling all over the lot.

722
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,014
What?

723
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,778
Do you know what happens
when dog gets bit by snake?

724
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:29,115
- What happens?
- Dog dies.

725
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:30,677
But we ain't got no snakes.

726
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:31,949
Oh?

727
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,886
What is that?

728
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:41,729
Yeah, a snake.

729
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,324
Yeah.

730
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:46,903
What you think now?

731
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:51,534
Do you think Kahler is
some kind of crazy boy, huh?

732
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:53,601
We go home, boys.

733
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,773
# Ah-ooo #

734
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:59,510
# Werewolves of London #

735
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,316
# Ah-ooo... #

736
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:07,519
Eberhardt, you look sick.

737
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,458
You should go home early.

738
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:10,960
I feel fine.

739
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:12,462
I don't care how you think you feel...

740
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:14,862
you should call your mom
and go home, bro.

741
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,527
Why?

742
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,536
Look, I know a guy
in Dana's P.E. class.

743
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,539
He says Dana's gonna snatch you
right before you get on the bus.

744
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:23,597
And do what?

745
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:26,337
Ahh, guess you got till 2:45 to find out.

746
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:29,312
In the meantime,
I'll get to work on your eulogy.

747
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:30,905
Eulogy?

748
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:32,415
So to answer your question...

749
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,817
Pacific swells are usually a lot bigger
than Atlantic swells.

750
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:39,118
But remember,
Kelly Slater is from Florida.

751
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,988
OK, test tomorrow.

752
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:45,018
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Be ready.

753
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:46,051
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

754
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,928
- See ya.
- Bye-bye.

755
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:49,762
- OK, bye.
- Bye.

756
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,789
Be ready.

757
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,826
- Bye, Mr. Ryan.
- Bye.

758
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:57,396
Roy, you OK?

759
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,966
Oh, yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

760
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:01,478
All right, <i>mañana.</i>

761
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,382
Hey, Mr. Ryan, wait up.

762
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:11,581
You going home, too?

763
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:12,680
Sooner or later.

764
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:15,954
I got some papers to grade, but hopefully
I'll catch a few waves before dinner.

765
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:19,485
Cool, I think, uh, I think I'm just gonna
walk with you for a little bit.

766
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,997
Isn't the bus the other way?

767
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,466
Ahh, just stretching my legs.

768
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:26,561
Roy, is there something
you want to talk to me about?

769
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,799
Oh, no, no, everything's fine.

770
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:31,239
Well, then you better get going
or you'll miss your bus.

771
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:32,333
Later, dude.

772
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:51,888
Ahh, get over here.

773
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,863
Aah!

774
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,864
Curly Brannit.

775
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,964
- Brannit, what's going on?
- Hello, sir.

776
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,838
Did you get my message
'bout the dogs?

777
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:07,708
You're telling me snakes
scared off the dogs?

778
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:10,646
Well, now, sir, theses wasn't
just your ordinary snakes...

779
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,841
these was cottonmouths.

780
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:14,942
And a cottonmouth'll kill a dog
pretty darn quick.

781
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:17,180
Really? Can they kill a bulldozer?

782
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:19,781
Probably not.

783
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:22,918
Brannit, I am this close
to firing up the chopper...

784
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,723
and coming down there myself.

785
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,389
And trust me, you do not want that.

786
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:30,366
No, sir.

787
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:31,732
I told you, it was settled.

788
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:33,259
Ow!

789
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:34,794
Not even close.

790
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:36,670
Aah, ha ha ha!

791
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,368
Help! Help!

792
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:39,637
Come on, cowgirl.

793
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:40,837
Aah!

794
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,311
Aah, shh... ow!

795
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:43,677
Leave me al... ow!

796
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:44,840
Aah! Aah!

797
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,042
Aah, uh.

798
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:48,051
Uh! Ha ha ha.

799
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:49,382
Aah! Aah!

800
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,717
Aah! Aah! Aah!

801
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,552
Aah! Oh, I jus...

802
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:58,391
Um, Mr. Ryan?

803
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:23,480
How in the heck did that...

804
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:24,852
Hey!

805
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,254
You did that?

806
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,054
You can thank me later,
but right now we gotta go.

807
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,321
Hop on, I need your help.

808
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,292
Ha ha ha.

809
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:42,027
Aah!

810
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:43,607
Grr.

811
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:48,611
Did you get everything I wanted?

812
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:51,376
Yep, my mom keeps a trauma unit
under the sink.

813
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:52,473
OK, come on. We gotta go.

814
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:17,306
I came by at lunch,
and I found him like this.

815
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,536
Uh, uh.

816
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,069
The dog got me.

817
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:26,276
Sss...

818
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,445
Sss... uhh.

819
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,852
Let me see.

820
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:33,789
I'm going to put some
antibiotic cream on for now.

821
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,587
But you're gonna need a doctor.

822
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:39,691
Uh, I'll be OK, all right?

823
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:40,719
Sss...

824
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:42,925
Uhh.

825
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:44,366
How'd you get bit?

826
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:45,993
My arm got stuck.

827
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:47,060
Sss...

828
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:49,004
- Doing what?
- Uhh.

829
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:52,008
Sss. Uhh.

830
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:55,307
I got some little friends I look after
over at this construction site.

831
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,974
Anyway, they brought
in these big dogs to get rid of me.

832
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:02,384
So, I put some snakes
around the lot to freak the dogs out.

833
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:04,387
See, I knew the trainer
would drag 'em out of there...

834
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:05,649
when he saw that
they were cottonmouths.

835
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,781
Sss. Ow.

836
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:08,314
Does this have anything
to do with that cop car...

837
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,883
that got painted black?

838
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:11,986
The gators in the toilet?

839
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,658
If they build that pancake place,
those baby owls are toast.

840
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,963
Yeah. Yeah, I've seen those owls.

841
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:19,799
Wait, you have?

842
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:21,498
Why don't they just
build somewhere else?

843
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,336
We tried to tell them about the nest...

844
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,172
But all we got back was this form letter
from this jerk named Muckle...

845
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,701
saying they had all the permits
they needed to build.

846
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:30,338
They don't care about little birds.

847
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,372
My brother's been trying
to stall them ever since.

848
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:33,974
Uhh...

849
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:36,282
Hey, hey. You OK?

850
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,515
Ha... are you kidding?

851
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,650
Uhh... I feel like a million bucks.

852
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:44,919
Uhh...

853
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:54,467
Hey! H... unh!

854
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:56,029
Uhh! Uhh!

855
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,507
Let's get him to a hospital.

856
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:05,106
The Central Florida shrimping industry
has suffered major...

857
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:11,054
Are you a <i>big boy</i>
with a big appetite?

858
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,522
You betcha, I am.

859
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:15,047
Then come on down
to Mother Paula's...

860
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:18,550
for our famous all-you-can-eat
pancake buffet.

861
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,359
# Mother Paula's, we cover the world #

862
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:21,887
Huh?

863
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,957
# One flapjack at a... #

864
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,004
What are you up to now?

865
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,004
Uh...

866
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:40,809
Uh...

867
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:43,445
Uh!

868
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,647
Aah!

869
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:54,489
This is bad, cowgirl.
Really bad.

870
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:56,658
Don't worry.
He's gonna be fine.

871
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,792
I'm worried about him.

872
00:43:57,835 --> 00:43:59,302
I've never seen him act like this.

873
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:01,896
Which one of you
is Roy Eberhardt?

874
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:06,601
- He is.
- He is.

875
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:13,073
- Police officer?
- Hi, there!

876
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:14,311
What's this about?

877
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,385
Must be Roy's parents.

878
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:21,357
I'm Officer Delinko, C.C.P.D.

879
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:23,292
- OK.
- Hi.

880
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,955
Anyhoo, I, uh,
I met Roy the other day...

881
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,793
he got a flat.
I gave him a ride home.

882
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,629
So, when I heard over the radio
that he was in the hospital...

883
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,863
and they couldn't reach
his parents by the phone...

884
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:35,599
I figured I'd just come by
and see if I could find y'all.

885
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:37,436
- In the hospital?
- Oh, my God.

886
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:38,736
- Is he OK?
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

887
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:39,765
No, he's...

888
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,175
he, uh, he got bit by a dog.

889
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:42,906
He's gonna be fine.
That's the word.

890
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:46,109
So, uh, you a police officer,
Mr. Eberhardt?

891
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,378
I'm with the Department of Justice.

892
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:48,407
Where's Roy at?

893
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:50,249
Oh, right. Sorry.
He's um...

894
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:51,777
he's over in the hospital
on Eighth Street.

895
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:52,811
Honey!

896
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,551
So, wow.
Department of Justice.

897
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:57,492
We oughta get together
and swap stories sometime.

898
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,520
I'd, uh, take you over there myself,
but I'm in this...

899
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:03,633
this, uh, smallish vehicle, and you'II...

900
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:05,897
probably get there before me.

901
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:06,925
Let's go.

902
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,767
Anyways.

903
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:11,297
I'm in... this thing.

904
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:12,899
This... this...

905
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:18,013
Tell me again what happened,
from the beginning.

906
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,811
All right.

907
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:23,650
A dog the size of a Buick
attacked Roy at soccer practice.

908
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:25,587
He came home all chewed up...

909
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:27,351
so we brought him here
as fast as we could.

910
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,380
It's true!

911
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:31,326
N-no, I believe your brother
was attacked by a dog...

912
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:34,023
I just don't believe
that it happened today.

913
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,498
Judging by how far
the infection has progressed...

914
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:40,902
I'd estimate he was bitten...
eighteen to twenty-four hours ago?

915
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:44,430
Yeah. Eighteen hours,
that sounds about right.

916
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:46,636
Because he, um...

917
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:49,612
he, uh, right, he passed out
right after he got bit.

918
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:53,207
It wasn't until the next day
that Beatrice called me and asked me...

919
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,275
if I'd help get him to a hospital.

920
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:59,153
I see. And...
where are your parents?

921
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:00,213
- Their parents...
- Well...

922
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:03,317
Their parents, they, uh,
they work on a crab boat.

923
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,793
And you are?

924
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:06,625
Uh...

925
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,067
- Ling Ho.
- Uh. OK.

926
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,728
Here's what's going to happen.

927
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,931
I'm going to go attend to Roy.

928
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,769
And then the three of us
are gonna sit down...

929
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:18,866
and somebody's gonna
start telling me the truth.

930
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:20,570
OK?

931
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:21,600
Ling Ho?

932
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:28,916
Ling Ho?

933
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,250
You couldn't come up with anything
better than Ling Ho?

934
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,277
Uh...

935
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:33,755
This is not gonna work, cowgirl.

936
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,691
Once they figure out
that Mullet's not you...

937
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:36,750
they're gonna put him in juvey...

938
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:37,920
or Lana's gonna
ship him off somewhere...

939
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,087
where he <i>can't</i> run away.

940
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,323
Don't worry.

941
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:41,797
We'll come up with something.

942
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:44,629
I bet you will, cowgirl.

943
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:46,863
But I gotta go.

944
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:48,337
But wait... wait.

945
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:49,600
Where are you going?

946
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,164
To fix dinner for my dad.

947
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:52,197
I do it every night.

948
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:53,732
I'll be back in an hour.

949
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:55,267
I promise.

950
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,337
You're kidding, right?

951
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:06,188
Hey! Come on!
Get that tin can outta the road!

952
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:13,763
We tried to get a hold of you,
but his friend said you were out at sea.

953
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:15,162
That you work on a crab boat.

954
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,188
What?

955
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:20,101
Anyway, he was bitten by a dog,
so we've got him on an antibiotic drip.

956
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:21,968
With a little rest, he should be just fine.

957
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:30,302
Where's Roy?

958
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,905
I just...

959
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:33,541
I mean, I really...

960
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,144
Ahh.

961
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,175
I don't know.

962
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:39,815
You don't know? One minute there's
an injured boy in this bed...

963
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,085
the next minute, he just vanished?

964
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:44,525
And how can you lose the one
and only patient that you have?

965
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:47,328
Mom! Dad!
I'm right here.

966
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,662
Oh, honey!
Are you OK?

967
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,668
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Roy, get back in the bed.

968
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:52,794
Let's get a look at those dog bites.

969
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:55,134
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Everybody, hold on a minute.

970
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:56,503
This is not Roy.

971
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,632
No, of course it is.

972
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:02,268
Guys, I didn't get bit.
It wasn't me.

973
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:06,043
Ahh. Excuse me, folks,
but we still have a patient missing.

974
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:08,711
Can someone please explain to me
what's going on here?

975
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:12,854
I think only one person can do that.

976
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:17,156
Roy. Who was in that bed,
and where did he go?

977
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:18,991
And I wanna know now.

978
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:21,930
I don't know his real name,
and I don't know where he went.

979
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:24,490
I'm sorry.
But that's the truth.

980
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:29,032
Let me explain. All he was
trying to do was save the owls.

981
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,802
If the Mother Paula's
people bulldoze that lot...

982
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:33,104
they'll bury all the dens.

983
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:34,610
Owls'll be gone.

984
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:36,977
Roy, it's their property.

985
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:39,676
But it doesn't mean that it's right, Dad.

986
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:42,446
Those owls can't
fight for themselves.

987
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:44,044
Somebody's gotta stick up for them.

988
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,782
That's all he was trying to do.

989
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:48,886
Ahh.

990
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,388
You're just getting settled here, Roy.

991
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,090
Why you wanna get mixed up in all this?

992
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:55,723
I wasn't looking for it.

993
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:56,994
It just happened.

994
00:48:57,034 --> 00:48:58,501
What just happened?

995
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:00,833
Some pirate kid hassling
a construction site?

996
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:03,135
I didn't do anything
to that construction site.

997
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:04,231
I'm not finished.

998
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,333
Roy, you broke a kid's nose.

999
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:09,072
You got... you got, uh,
suspended from the school bus.

1000
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,977
Today a police officer
shows up at our house.

1001
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:13,608
What's going on with you?

1002
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,550
You've always had such good judgment.

1003
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:17,917
Where is it?
Where is it?

1004
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:47,245
Room service.

1005
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:48,273
- Here.
- Oh.

1006
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:50,309
Thanks.

1007
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:52,652
Um, how's your arm?

1008
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:57,558
Eh, fever's gone, but I ache all over.

1009
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,319
Get in trouble last night?

1010
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:02,127
No big deal.
But I had to tell my dad...

1011
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,133
about the owls and Mother Paula's.

1012
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:06,659
What'd he say?

1013
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:08,637
He said they can build
whatever they want...

1014
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,469
as long as they have legal papers.

1015
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,532
There's really nothing we can do.

1016
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:13,975
We?

1017
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,239
You know what I mean.

1018
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:17,576
You're saying it's a lost cause, right?

1019
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:19,673
Hey, come on, Tex.

1020
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:22,514
You gotta start thinking like an outlaw.

1021
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:23,917
I'm not an outlaw.

1022
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:26,822
Yeah, you are.

1023
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,415
Last night at the hospital.

1024
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:31,120
That was definitely an outlaw move.

1025
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:33,254
You were hurt.

1026
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:36,527
You crossed the line, 'cause you cared
about what happened to me.

1027
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:39,066
Hey. Come on.

1028
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:40,399
I got something
really cool to show you.

1029
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:44,599
Ever since I was little,
I've been watching this place disappear.

1030
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:48,168
The piney woods, the mangroves,
the creeks, the glades.

1031
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,576
Even the beaches.

1032
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:53,071
And they put up these giant hotels
and only goober tourists are allowed.

1033
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:54,845
It really sucks.

1034
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,352
The same thing's
happening everywhere.

1035
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,513
Wait, they got mountains
where you're from, right?

1036
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,614
Yeah. Miles and miles of 'em.

1037
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:02,284
See, that's what we need here.

1038
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:04,885
I mean, this state's so flat,
there's nothing to stop 'em...

1039
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:07,488
from bulldozing from one coast to another.

1040
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:10,726
Except for you.

1041
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,169
Yeah.

1042
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:16,229
Except for me.

1043
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:33,319
Cool. Watch this.

1044
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,247
Whoo-hoo!

1045
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:37,453
Take a peek.

1046
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:38,859
What is it?

1047
00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:39,953
It's a mullet.

1048
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:43,625
See, that's why my sister
calls me Mullet Fingers.

1049
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:46,033
Ain't too many people
who can do that, you know?

1050
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,035
Bye, little guy.

1051
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:53,133
Swim fast.

1052
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:07,350
# I come from where
the rivers meet the sea #

1053
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:13,288
# That's why I think
I'm so wild and fancy free #

1054
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:18,261
# I was early into crazy ways #

1055
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:20,861
# My folks said, it's just a phase #

1056
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:23,270
# They were hoping for better days #

1057
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:30,204
# Now in my line of work #

1058
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:33,978
# I seem to see
a lot more than most #

1059
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:36,281
# I write 'em down
and I pass 'em around #

1060
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,719
# It's the gospel from the coast #

1061
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:41,690
# Reflections, not just replays #

1062
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:43,317
# Takin' time to escape the maze #

1063
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,793
What is that?

1064
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:47,126
# Lookin' for better days #

1065
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:51,360
# Looking to the left #

1066
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:54,893
# Looking to the right #

1067
00:52:54,938 --> 00:52:58,840
# Looking to the stars
to shed some light #

1068
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,604
# Hoping for a breath #

1069
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:06,480
# Hoping for break #

1070
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:11,419
# Hopin' for the give without the take #

1071
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:25,127
Now...

1072
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:27,859
You gotta bite this.

1073
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:29,565
- Bite it.
- I got it.

1074
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:40,879
Oh! Look at all that!

1075
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:42,043
# Pale invaders
and tanned crusaders #

1076
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:43,109
It's huge.

1077
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:45,519
# Are worshipping the sun #

1078
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,716
# On the corner of
Walk and Don't Walk #

1079
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:50,351
# Somewhere down U.S. One #

1080
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:53,123
# Back to livin' Floridays #

1081
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:56,291
# Blue skies and ultraviolet rays #

1082
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:58,733
# Lookin' for better days #

1083
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:01,999
# I'm back to livin' Floridays #

1084
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:05,166
# Blue skies and ultraviolet rays #

1085
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:06,971
# We're lookin' for better days #

1086
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,046
Seeing all the wildlife
with Mullet Fingers...

1087
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,607
made me want to swing by
and try to get another look at the owls.

1088
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:23,019
Change of plan, boys.

1089
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:24,492
Oh, yeah.

1090
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:38,572
Well, look who's decided
to do a little police work.

1091
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:50,183
That should do it.

1092
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:15,671
Hey, cowgirl.

1093
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:20,316
- Uhh!
- Aah!

1094
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,318
Beatrice the Bear isn't here
to save you this time.

1095
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:25,685
Uhh! You're gonna be sorry
you ever messed with me!

1096
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:26,711
Aah!

1097
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:28,587
Uhh! Grr.

1098
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:31,685
Right behind you, cowgirl.

1099
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:37,832
Ow! Uhh!

1100
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:39,494
Damn it! Ow!
Uh huh huh!

1101
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:41,231
Uhh! Aah! Uhh! Ow!

1102
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:42,898
Ow! Uhh! Huh! Uhh!

1103
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:43,928
Aah! Oh!

1104
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:48,141
You say there.

1105
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,646
Looks like I got me a rat.

1106
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,012
Big ol' rat in a trap.

1107
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:54,676
Don't you move.

1108
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:56,151
Yeah, I won't. I won't.

1109
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,676
We caught it.

1110
00:55:57,721 --> 00:55:59,746
Caught the Mother Paula's vandal.

1111
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:00,881
Caught him red-handed.

1112
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:02,152
The what?

1113
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,250
You're crazy, man.

1114
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:04,521
I've never been here before!

1115
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:05,960
Stay down. Stay down.
I'll take it from here.

1116
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:07,724
<i>I'm</i> crazy? <i>I'm</i> crazy?

1117
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:09,026
Hey, calm down. Calm down.

1118
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:10,362
Get... get your arms up here.

1119
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,628
What's your name, son?

1120
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:13,966
Roy. Roy Eberhardt.

1121
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:18,872
Well, Roy, looks like your chubby
little reign of terror is over.

1122
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:20,136
Hold on a second.

1123
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:22,167
I know Roy Eberhardt,
and this isn't him.

1124
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,270
Uh-huh?

1125
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:25,281
So I assume
you wanna press charges?

1126
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:27,875
Well, you bet your cute
little scooter, I do.

1127
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:31,409
Yeah, attempted burglary, trespassing,
destruction of private property...

1128
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:32,443
and so forth.

1129
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:33,478
Ow.

1130
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:35,821
You know, you could make this
a lot easier on yourself, son.

1131
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:36,848
Yeah, right.

1132
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:39,225
Just tell us your real name
and quit acting dumb.

1133
00:56:39,262 --> 00:56:42,163
I ain't acting, and I ain't done
nothing wrong, so let me go!

1134
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:43,187
OK, have it your way.

1135
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,723
Oh, come on.

1136
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:46,736
# Hey, hey, hey #

1137
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:48,738
# Hey, hey, hey, hey #

1138
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:50,296
Hi, Captain.

1139
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:52,001
Don't just stand there like a seagull.

1140
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,702
Sit down.

1141
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,734
Sorry.

1142
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:56,768
Thanks.

1143
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:59,338
A heck of a collar out there, Delinko.

1144
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:01,043
Just got off the phone with the mayor.

1145
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:04,713
He says we need more cops
on the street like you. Heh heh heh.

1146
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:06,221
Sir, I was just doing my job.

1147
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,723
Right place at the right time.

1148
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,918
Did... did he really say that?

1149
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:12,928
Looks like you reeled in
one nasty bullshark.

1150
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:15,658
This Matherson kid's got
a heck of a rap sheet.

1151
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:17,222
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about, sir.

1152
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,758
If you look in his record,
it just doesn't make sense.

1153
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:22,294
I mean, shoplifting,
breaking into candy machines...

1154
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:24,636
th-this kid's a delinquent.
Not a vandal.

1155
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:25,732
It just doesn't add up to me.

1156
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:28,471
This is police work, Delinko, not algebra.

1157
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:30,843
Kid's been breaking the law
since kindergarten...

1158
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,245
and you caught him red-handed.

1159
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,579
Case closed.

1160
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:34,810
Well, sir, I just...

1161
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:37,684
I believe <i>these</i> belong to you.

1162
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,347
Oh, boy. My cruiser.

1163
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:40,686
Just remember.

1164
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:42,850
Screw up again,
you'll be swattin' skeeters...

1165
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:44,883
and counting cushions
at the boat ramp.

1166
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:46,657
Copy that, sir.

1167
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:52,930
Can't say, uh, I'm gonna miss
that, uh, smallish vehicle.

1168
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:53,993
Yeah.

1169
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,902
You expect me to do
the right thing...

1170
00:57:57,941 --> 00:57:59,431
and I'm trying my best.

1171
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:02,104
Well, we know you are, son.

1172
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,942
I'll see you in the morning, Roy.

1173
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,145
Tuck, tuck, tuck, tuck, tuck.

1174
00:58:09,185 --> 00:58:11,176
Toes.

1175
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:12,245
Good night, Roy.

1176
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:14,119
Night, Mom.

1177
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:16,214
Good night.

1178
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,988
Hey, Dad?

1179
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:21,118
Yeah?

1180
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,132
What do you do
to catch the bad guys?

1181
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,224
At work?

1182
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:25,325
Yeah.

1183
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:28,895
Well, uh, we don't chase our bad guys
down the streets.

1184
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:31,338
The key is to catch 'em
in their paperwork.

1185
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:33,968
Sooner or later, they all slip up,
and they leave a trail.

1186
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,238
Right.

1187
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:36,438
I know it's, uh, boring stuff...

1188
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:38,538
not the razzle dazzle
you were hoping for, right?

1189
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:40,776
I don't know. Maybe it is.

1190
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:42,717
OK. See ya. Get some sleep.

1191
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:44,242
Night, Dad.

1192
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,920
Tuck, tuck, tuck.

1193
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:56,153
Toes.

1194
00:58:57,566 --> 00:58:59,227
Don't freak out. It's me.

1195
00:58:59,268 --> 00:59:00,997
Me who?

1196
00:59:02,004 --> 00:59:03,631
Me, Beatrice.

1197
00:59:03,672 --> 00:59:05,799
How did you get in here?

1198
00:59:05,841 --> 00:59:06,967
Easy.

1199
00:59:07,009 --> 00:59:09,170
Sliding door on the porch
popped right off the track.

1200
00:59:09,211 --> 00:59:10,610
They all do.

1201
00:59:10,646 --> 00:59:13,171
How long have you been hiding here?

1202
00:59:13,215 --> 00:59:14,239
Oh, don't worry.

1203
00:59:14,283 --> 00:59:17,218
I closed my eyes while you put on
your very colorful jammies.

1204
00:59:18,587 --> 00:59:20,748
Are you completely whacko?

1205
00:59:20,789 --> 00:59:22,620
I'm sorry.

1206
00:59:22,658 --> 00:59:24,683
It's just...

1207
00:59:26,061 --> 00:59:28,894
Things got kind of crazy back at home.

1208
00:59:28,931 --> 00:59:31,798
My dad and Lana,
they got in this huge fight...

1209
00:59:31,834 --> 00:59:33,165
and I mean, huge.

1210
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:36,501
She threw a clock radio at his head,
so I beaned her with a mango.

1211
00:59:36,538 --> 00:59:38,836
She went berserk.

1212
00:59:38,874 --> 00:59:40,933
I didn't know where else to go.

1213
00:59:40,976 --> 00:59:44,537
I was gonna stay with Mullet,
but he wasn't at the boat yard.

1214
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:47,276
If you want, you can stay here.

1215
00:59:47,316 --> 00:59:50,012
Really?

1216
00:59:50,052 --> 00:59:53,249
Yeah. Just as long as
my parents don't check back in...

1217
00:59:53,289 --> 00:59:55,257
or we'll both be in trouble.

1218
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:57,589
You take the bed.
I'll sleep on the floor.

1219
00:59:57,626 --> 00:59:58,923
No way.

1220
00:59:58,961 --> 01:00:00,087
I'm fine right here.

1221
01:00:00,129 --> 01:00:02,791
All right. Suit yourself.

1222
01:00:16,378 --> 01:00:17,811
Hey, cowgirl?

1223
01:00:19,615 --> 01:00:21,480
Yeah?

1224
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:23,314
Ahh.

1225
01:00:24,486 --> 01:00:27,387
I'm really glad that, um...

1226
01:00:33,228 --> 01:00:35,128
I'm just gonna call you Roy from now on...

1227
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:36,631
if that's all right with you.

1228
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,934
And what's wrong with Ling Ho?

1229
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,494
Ha ha ha.

1230
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:44,165
Ow.

1231
01:00:55,417 --> 01:00:56,782
It's not like him to disappear.

1232
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:57,808
He must be up to something.

1233
01:00:57,853 --> 01:00:59,411
Don't worry.
We'll find him.

1234
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:00,444
- Hey!
- Aah!

1235
01:01:02,858 --> 01:01:04,086
- Ha ha.
- Ha ha ha.

1236
01:01:04,126 --> 01:01:05,593
You jerk.

1237
01:01:05,627 --> 01:01:06,924
What is that thing?

1238
01:01:06,962 --> 01:01:08,589
It's a bulldozer seat.

1239
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:10,097
What are you doing with it?

1240
01:01:10,132 --> 01:01:12,965
You can't drive a bulldozer
without a seat, Bea.

1241
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:14,196
Don't tell me you stole...

1242
01:01:14,236 --> 01:01:15,635
You're gonna love this.

1243
01:01:15,671 --> 01:01:16,660
Come on. I'll show you.

1244
01:01:16,705 --> 01:01:18,639
- Ha ha.
- Ha ha ha.

1245
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,144
What the...

1246
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:33,110
Shh.

1247
01:01:36,358 --> 01:01:37,825
Oh, mercy.

1248
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,019
Huh?

1249
01:01:42,064 --> 01:01:43,497
Not the seat!

1250
01:01:43,532 --> 01:01:45,193
You gotta be kidding me.

1251
01:01:45,234 --> 01:01:46,258
Let's go.

1252
01:01:51,707 --> 01:01:53,675
What am I gonna tell Muckle now?

1253
01:01:53,709 --> 01:01:56,269
You can start by telling me
why I shouldn't fire you.

1254
01:01:56,311 --> 01:01:58,336
Oh! Goodness gracious!

1255
01:01:58,380 --> 01:01:59,472
Mr. Muckle!

1256
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:02,484
We wasn't expecting you
until tomorrow.

1257
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:04,383
Yes, Mr. Brannit, I came a day early.

1258
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:06,684
I'm gonna be sticking
a silver shovel into somethin'...

1259
01:02:06,722 --> 01:02:08,485
at that groundbreaking
ceremony tomorrow.

1260
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:09,991
I want it to be free of you-know-whats.

1261
01:02:10,025 --> 01:02:11,356
Gotcha.

1262
01:02:11,393 --> 01:02:13,258
Oh!

1263
01:02:13,295 --> 01:02:14,922
Oh, my.

1264
01:02:14,963 --> 01:02:17,363
We're bulldozing today.

1265
01:02:17,399 --> 01:02:18,832
Today?

1266
01:02:18,867 --> 01:02:19,856
Today?

1267
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:21,335
This obviously wasn't something...

1268
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:22,928
I could count on you
to handle unsupervised.

1269
01:02:22,971 --> 01:02:25,439
Yes, sir, but today is gonna
be a little difficult.

1270
01:02:25,474 --> 01:02:26,600
Speak!

1271
01:02:26,642 --> 01:02:28,576
Well, we had another incident, sir.

1272
01:02:28,610 --> 01:02:31,841
And this time, somebody took the seat
off the bulldozer.

1273
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,905
What's the quickest
you can get a new seat?

1274
01:02:33,949 --> 01:02:37,612
Well, I guess I could head over
to construction supply in Fort Meyer.

1275
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:39,416
Go there, get it right now.

1276
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:41,980
I'll keep an eye on things here
and make sure nothing else happens.

1277
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:44,652
Oh, and, Brannit,
on your way back...

1278
01:02:44,693 --> 01:02:46,251
pick up Miss Nixon at the hotel.

1279
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:48,058
I want her
in her Mother Paula's costume...

1280
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:50,622
for a dress rehearsal at 3:00 sharp.

1281
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:51,894
And if you run into anyone...

1282
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:53,868
you keep your trap shut
about all this, you got it?

1283
01:02:53,902 --> 01:02:55,529
- Yes, sir.
- Good, go.

1284
01:02:55,571 --> 01:03:00,941
Mr. Muckle,
I just want to say that...

1285
01:03:00,976 --> 01:03:03,376
I've been trying like
the dickens down here...

1286
01:03:03,412 --> 01:03:05,107
Get seat!
Get Mother Paula.

1287
01:03:05,147 --> 01:03:06,705
- Get going.
- Yes, sir.

1288
01:03:06,748 --> 01:03:08,113
- Let's go.
- OK, let's go.

1289
01:03:10,085 --> 01:03:14,385
So, uh, you've had some time
to think about your situation?

1290
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:16,152
I don't need to think, all right?

1291
01:03:16,191 --> 01:03:18,216
That's how come I got a lawyer.

1292
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:24,130
Hey, did, uh, you spray-paint
the windows of my squad car?

1293
01:03:24,166 --> 01:03:26,225
How 'bout those gators in the toilet?

1294
01:03:26,268 --> 01:03:28,293
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

1295
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:29,668
Oh, really?

1296
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:30,729
- Yeah, really.
- Yeah?

1297
01:03:30,772 --> 01:03:32,831
Now why don't you be a good cop
and go get me some donuts?

1298
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:35,036
OK, and that's the end
of the nice interrogation.

1299
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:36,374
Now it time for a little hardball.

1300
01:03:36,411 --> 01:03:38,072
Wa...

1301
01:03:38,113 --> 01:03:39,171
Ha ha ha.

1302
01:03:39,214 --> 01:03:40,681
That was smooth.

1303
01:03:40,716 --> 01:03:43,514
You know, you just got
to relax, all right?

1304
01:03:43,552 --> 01:03:45,383
'Cause you got
a long day ahead of ya.

1305
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:46,682
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1306
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:48,212
Hey, mister, it's that attitude...

1307
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:49,918
that got you in here
in the first place, OK?

1308
01:03:49,958 --> 01:03:50,947
Remember that.

1309
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:54,724
No, what got me here in the first place
is that little twerp Eberhardt, all right?

1310
01:03:54,763 --> 01:03:56,924
He set me up.
I didn't do anything.

1311
01:03:56,965 --> 01:04:02,597
Huh. Wow, this Roy Eberhardt
seem like quite the little evil genius.

1312
01:04:02,638 --> 01:04:03,798
See you later.

1313
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,466
Oh, I actually got you something.

1314
01:04:05,507 --> 01:04:06,872
What, what is it?

1315
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:10,345
Well, you know, I figured you'd
be going away for about six months...

1316
01:04:10,379 --> 01:04:12,244
and I thought you might
get a little Ionely.

1317
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:14,112
So l... I picked you something up.

1318
01:04:14,149 --> 01:04:16,617
I don't know, you kind of struck me
as some what of a nature boy...

1319
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:17,744
so I got you this little guy.

1320
01:04:17,786 --> 01:04:19,185
- There he is.
- Oh, my God.

1321
01:04:19,221 --> 01:04:21,121
Get it out! Get it out!
Get it away! Get it away!

1322
01:04:21,156 --> 01:04:23,454
- Are you sure?
- Get it away!

1323
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:26,359
OK, Dana,
you passed the lie detector test.

1324
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:28,226
Crude? Yeah, but effective.

1325
01:04:32,267 --> 01:04:34,258
Today? I can't believe this.

1326
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,292
I can't believe this.

1327
01:04:35,337 --> 01:04:36,531
We've got to do something.

1328
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:37,561
Ahh, well, yeah,
I'm gonna do something.

1329
01:04:37,606 --> 01:04:38,868
- Like what?
- Well, first...

1330
01:04:38,907 --> 01:04:40,932
I'm gonna hotwire
Muckle's precious Hummer.

1331
01:04:40,976 --> 01:04:42,136
I'm gonna hook it up to that
construction trailer...

1332
01:04:42,177 --> 01:04:43,201
Wait a minute.

1333
01:04:43,245 --> 01:04:44,473
That's crazy.

1334
01:04:44,513 --> 01:04:45,537
And I'll drive 'em
to the edge of the canal...

1335
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:47,048
put a brick on the gas pedal...

1336
01:04:47,082 --> 01:04:48,481
and release the emergency brake.

1337
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:49,916
You can't do that.

1338
01:04:49,952 --> 01:04:51,852
It'll sink like a rock, pretty quick.

1339
01:04:51,887 --> 01:04:53,616
And that'll give me time
to come up with somethin'...

1340
01:04:53,655 --> 01:04:54,986
that'll really freak 'em out.

1341
01:04:55,023 --> 01:04:56,422
No. No, way.

1342
01:04:56,458 --> 01:04:58,323
You'll slow them down,
but you won't stop them.

1343
01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:59,554
We've been through this.

1344
01:04:59,595 --> 01:05:00,994
Plus, you'll end up in jail...

1345
01:05:01,029 --> 01:05:04,123
and then nobody in town
will be in the mood to hear the truth.

1346
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:05,531
Ahh.

1347
01:05:05,567 --> 01:05:07,364
- Ahh.
- Ahh.

1348
01:05:07,402 --> 01:05:09,495
We're the only ones who care.

1349
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:11,267
We're the only ones who know.

1350
01:05:11,306 --> 01:05:13,638
We got to let the town know
what Muckle's up to...

1351
01:05:13,675 --> 01:05:15,700
and stop this construction
once and for all.

1352
01:05:15,744 --> 01:05:17,371
That's what we've been trying to do.

1353
01:05:17,412 --> 01:05:19,778
These idiots around here
won't give a dang.

1354
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:23,615
They're all too excited
about having a stupid pancake house.

1355
01:05:23,652 --> 01:05:25,643
Look, I've got an idea.

1356
01:05:25,687 --> 01:05:28,622
If it doesn't work,
you're gonna do what you have to do.

1357
01:05:28,657 --> 01:05:30,784
But can we at least try it my way first?

1358
01:05:32,728 --> 01:05:34,093
It's worth a shot.

1359
01:05:35,964 --> 01:05:37,932
All right.

1360
01:05:37,966 --> 01:05:40,526
So what's your brilliant plan?

1361
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:42,093
So here's what we're gonna do...

1362
01:05:48,577 --> 01:05:52,445
Burrowing owls.

1363
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:56,584
They're legally protected.

1364
01:05:58,153 --> 01:06:00,781
Hello, this is Monica calling
from Mother Paula's...

1365
01:06:00,822 --> 01:06:02,756
to confirm that the mayor
will be here today at 3:30...

1366
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:04,088
for the groundbreaking ceremony.

1367
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:05,252
Today?

1368
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:07,262
I have that scheduled for tomorrow.

1369
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:08,786
That's why I'm calling.

1370
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:11,298
We had to reschedule due
to an unexpected rain tomorrow.

1371
01:06:11,333 --> 01:06:13,858
Mother Paula can do a lot of things,
but she can't change the weather.

1372
01:06:13,902 --> 01:06:15,665
That would be Mother Nature.

1373
01:06:15,704 --> 01:06:17,171
Thank you again for calling.

1374
01:06:17,205 --> 01:06:18,797
And I'll be sure and let everyone know.

1375
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,102
OK, no problem.

1376
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:24,772
Hey, if you want to bring two cameras,
l... I mean, that's what WZBY is bringing.

1377
01:06:24,813 --> 01:06:27,338
But, hey, I'm just the P.R. guy
at Mother Paula's.

1378
01:06:27,382 --> 01:06:29,441
You guys are the journalists.

1379
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:42,626
Here you go. Plans, permits,
environmental reports. Make it snappy.

1380
01:06:42,664 --> 01:06:44,791
I got a conch salad
going bad in the back.

1381
01:06:57,612 --> 01:06:59,477
That's weird.

1382
01:07:06,588 --> 01:07:08,613
Is there another copy of this report?

1383
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:12,519
Yeah. The foreman's supposed
to have one at the job site.

1384
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:17,159
Thanks.

1385
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:19,689
Roy?

1386
01:07:30,312 --> 01:07:32,371
Say, excuse me,
where'd that kid go?

1387
01:07:32,414 --> 01:07:34,041
I don't know, he was just here.

1388
01:07:34,082 --> 01:07:35,845
What he do, Officer?

1389
01:07:35,884 --> 01:07:38,250
It's police business.
What was he doing in here?

1390
01:07:38,286 --> 01:07:41,119
He was looking at the files
on the new pancake house.

1391
01:07:43,325 --> 01:07:45,520
What is he up to?

1392
01:07:51,266 --> 01:07:52,324
Thanks.

1393
01:08:01,743 --> 01:08:03,404
Where's that nitwit?

1394
01:08:16,324 --> 01:08:18,690
Thinking about crashing my party?

1395
01:08:18,727 --> 01:08:22,356
How 'bout a little artic blast
to change your mind?

1396
01:08:23,398 --> 01:08:25,093
Ha ha ha.

1397
01:08:25,133 --> 01:08:27,567
Yeah, you might want
to throw on a sweater.

1398
01:08:27,602 --> 01:08:29,797
There's a cold front
blowing into Florida.

1399
01:08:31,339 --> 01:08:32,397
Ha!

1400
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:33,965
Heh heh heh.

1401
01:08:34,009 --> 01:08:37,274
Hey, little birdie,
you wanna meet my friend?

1402
01:08:37,312 --> 01:08:39,075
Say hello to Jack Frost.

1403
01:08:43,385 --> 01:08:45,546
Heh heh heh.

1404
01:08:45,587 --> 01:08:48,886
I wouldn't do that again if I were you.

1405
01:08:48,924 --> 01:08:50,949
Who's gonna stop me, you?

1406
01:08:50,992 --> 01:08:52,152
You asked for it.

1407
01:08:52,194 --> 01:08:53,183
What are you gonna do?

1408
01:08:53,228 --> 01:08:54,820
You gonna throw
your little butterfly net?

1409
01:08:55,831 --> 01:08:56,957
Is that what you're gonna do?

1410
01:08:56,998 --> 01:08:58,693
Oh, no. Please... hey.

1411
01:08:58,733 --> 01:09:01,998
Hey. OK, you just made
a big mistake, nature boy.

1412
01:09:02,037 --> 01:09:04,130
Ooh! Oof!

1413
01:09:04,172 --> 01:09:05,867
Ouch.

1414
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:09,510
So why are there
palm trees in Ireland?

1415
01:09:09,544 --> 01:09:12,069
Because the tropical waters
of the Gulf Stream...

1416
01:09:12,113 --> 01:09:14,741
traveling north from Florida...

1417
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:15,977
Roy, you're late.

1418
01:09:16,017 --> 01:09:18,008
- Sorry.
- Take a seat.

1419
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:23,381
Mr. Ryan, I know this is kind of weird...

1420
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:25,290
But can I make
an announcement real quick?

1421
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:27,955
I hope it's important.

1422
01:09:27,996 --> 01:09:29,054
It's really important.

1423
01:09:34,169 --> 01:09:36,034
I know you don't know me very well yet...

1424
01:09:36,071 --> 01:09:37,663
but...

1425
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:39,264
I need your help.

1426
01:09:39,307 --> 01:09:41,537
When I heard this new
pancake house was being built...

1427
01:09:41,576 --> 01:09:42,736
I thought...

1428
01:09:42,777 --> 01:09:44,039
Cool.

1429
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:47,310
l... I mean, who doesn't love pancakes?

1430
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:49,010
But then a friend took me out there...

1431
01:09:49,050 --> 01:09:50,847
and showed me something
that changed my mind.

1432
01:09:54,122 --> 01:09:55,419
What's he doing?

1433
01:09:55,457 --> 01:09:57,049
What's he talking about?

1434
01:09:57,092 --> 01:09:59,686
Just... everybody, come
to the Mother Paula's lot...

1435
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:00,990
right after school.

1436
01:10:01,029 --> 01:10:02,963
What?

1437
01:10:02,998 --> 01:10:04,397
I don't know.

1438
01:10:04,432 --> 01:10:05,626
As I was saying...

1439
01:10:05,667 --> 01:10:09,068
the... the tropical waters
of the Gulf Stream...

1440
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:12,540
move north from Florida
across the Atlantic...

1441
01:10:15,410 --> 01:10:17,970
Officer, what can I do for you?

1442
01:10:18,013 --> 01:10:19,002
Yeah, 'scuse me.

1443
01:10:19,047 --> 01:10:22,380
I'm, uh, looking for Roy Eberhardt.

1444
01:10:22,417 --> 01:10:24,282
Oh, Roy.

1445
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:26,583
Roy. I think...

1446
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:30,952
I think he's over there.

1447
01:10:34,729 --> 01:10:36,629
Ahem.

1448
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:37,859
Roy, I need to ask you a question.

1449
01:10:37,899 --> 01:10:39,423
Meet in fifteen minutes at the marina.

1450
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:45,399
Hey!

1451
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,429
Hey, hold up!

1452
01:10:46,474 --> 01:10:47,463
Stop!

1453
01:10:51,313 --> 01:10:53,042
Freeze!

1454
01:10:53,081 --> 01:10:54,548
Roy Eberhardt!

1455
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,073
Come here! Roy!

1456
01:10:57,252 --> 01:10:58,241
Hey!

1457
01:11:13,168 --> 01:11:14,260
Roy, come on now.

1458
01:11:14,302 --> 01:11:15,462
I just wanna talk to you, all right?

1459
01:11:15,503 --> 01:11:17,164
I just wanna ask you
a few questions.

1460
01:11:17,205 --> 01:11:18,467
That's all, all right?

1461
01:11:18,506 --> 01:11:20,371
Whoa!

1462
01:11:38,393 --> 01:11:42,124
Pull your vehicle
to the side of the road, son.

1463
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:47,565
No, not my cruiser.

1464
01:11:47,602 --> 01:11:48,591
Come on.

1465
01:11:51,172 --> 01:11:52,935
That's gonna leave a dent.

1466
01:11:55,043 --> 01:11:56,374
Oh!

1467
01:12:04,152 --> 01:12:05,676
Come on, Roy.
Please, pull over.

1468
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:07,449
I just wanna ask you
a few questions.

1469
01:12:12,927 --> 01:12:15,794
All right, no more Mr. Nice Cop.

1470
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:26,366
You got nowhere else to go, Roy!

1471
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:30,071
Roy, stop!
Hey, Roy, stop!

1472
01:12:30,111 --> 01:12:31,578
Hey, right there.

1473
01:12:31,613 --> 01:12:33,706
Just give me a second.
I can explain everything...

1474
01:12:33,748 --> 01:12:35,010
if you just give me
one second. l...

1475
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:36,517
That was option "A," Roy.

1476
01:12:36,551 --> 01:12:40,214
OK, but then you fled the scene
and you resisted an officer.

1477
01:12:40,255 --> 01:12:42,689
All right? I know you're
involved in this somehow.

1478
01:12:42,724 --> 01:12:45,090
I got to take you in.
I got no other choice.

1479
01:12:45,126 --> 01:12:46,354
OK?

1480
01:12:46,394 --> 01:12:49,295
Officer, I'm sorry.
I know this might look bad.

1481
01:12:49,330 --> 01:12:51,662
There's something I got to do.

1482
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:02,538
Ohh.

1483
01:13:02,577 --> 01:13:03,976
Uhh.

1484
01:13:07,148 --> 01:13:08,137
Roy!

1485
01:13:09,851 --> 01:13:10,840
Roy!

1486
01:13:19,227 --> 01:13:20,489
Damn it!

1487
01:13:30,171 --> 01:13:31,160
How'd it go?

1488
01:13:31,206 --> 01:13:32,468
You're never going to believe this.

1489
01:13:32,507 --> 01:13:34,270
Uh, we ran into a little trouble.

1490
01:13:34,309 --> 01:13:36,800
The police are after me,
and we're out of time.

1491
01:13:36,845 --> 01:13:38,779
If you think that's a little trouble...

1492
01:13:38,813 --> 01:13:41,304
then you're really gonna get
a kick out of this.

1493
01:13:46,788 --> 01:13:47,777
What are we doing here?

1494
01:13:47,822 --> 01:13:49,050
Yeah, what's going on?

1495
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:54,055
Mmm-mmm-mmm!

1496
01:13:54,095 --> 01:13:57,189
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm!
Mmm-mmm!

1497
01:13:57,232 --> 01:13:58,221
Uhh.

1498
01:13:58,266 --> 01:13:59,927
Mmm-mmm-mm-mm-mm!

1499
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:01,959
You can't do this!

1500
01:14:02,003 --> 01:14:03,334
It just happened.

1501
01:14:03,371 --> 01:14:05,430
He was trying to kill the owls.

1502
01:14:05,473 --> 01:14:06,565
What was I supposed to do?

1503
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:09,372
We got to get him out of here now
before people start...

1504
01:14:11,846 --> 01:14:12,870
Mmm-mmm-mmm!

1505
01:14:12,914 --> 01:14:13,903
Showing up.

1506
01:14:15,016 --> 01:14:16,574
Too late.

1507
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:18,279
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.

1508
01:14:21,189 --> 01:14:23,157
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1509
01:14:23,191 --> 01:14:24,920
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1510
01:14:29,264 --> 01:14:30,856
Now, where's Muckle?

1511
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:33,424
Uh, maybe in the trailer, Mr. Mayor.

1512
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:42,337
Hi, Mayor Grandy.

1513
01:14:42,377 --> 01:14:44,277
Is Mr. Muckle in there?

1514
01:14:44,312 --> 01:14:46,974
Uh, yeah... um, no.
He's been delayed.

1515
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:50,348
Um, I'm actually Mr. Muckle's
daughter, Mary Myrtle Muckle.

1516
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:51,977
He just wanted me to let you know...

1517
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:53,317
that everything
is proceeding as planned...

1518
01:14:53,354 --> 01:14:55,948
and he's going to need
just a few more minutes.

1519
01:14:57,692 --> 01:14:58,784
What are you doing?

1520
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:00,920
I'm looking for the other copy
of the environmental report.

1521
01:15:00,962 --> 01:15:01,951
Mm-mmm.

1522
01:15:05,366 --> 01:15:08,164
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!

1523
01:15:08,203 --> 01:15:10,194
Mmm-m-m-m!

1524
01:15:10,238 --> 01:15:11,398
Three...

1525
01:15:11,439 --> 01:15:13,839
four...
Mmm-mmm.

1526
01:15:13,875 --> 01:15:16,844
Put your hands together
for Mayor Grandy.

1527
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:22,614
Welcome, Mayor Grandy!
Yeah! Whoo!

1528
01:15:22,650 --> 01:15:25,175
Bingo! Page five. Yes!

1529
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:28,781
There's a cop walking this way.
Let's go!

1530
01:15:28,823 --> 01:15:29,812
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

1531
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:30,950
Go! Go! Go! Go!

1532
01:15:30,992 --> 01:15:34,860
Mmm-mmm-mm-mm-mmm-
mmm-mmm-m-mmm-mm-mmm.

1533
01:15:38,032 --> 01:15:41,001
Good afternoon,
Coconut Cove. I love it!

1534
01:15:41,035 --> 01:15:44,664
Love you, love you.
Welcome...

1535
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:46,071
Open up. Police.

1536
01:15:46,107 --> 01:15:50,703
Mother Paula's
Pancake House! Welcome!

1537
01:15:50,745 --> 01:15:52,007
Hello?

1538
01:15:52,046 --> 01:15:55,641
Mm-mmm-mm-mmm-mmm-mm.

1539
01:15:58,019 --> 01:16:00,681
Mm.

1540
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:03,020
Mmm-mmm.

1541
01:16:07,662 --> 01:16:09,391
Mmm-mmm.

1542
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:13,429
Mmm. Mmm-mmm.

1543
01:16:13,468 --> 01:16:15,299
What are we going to do?

1544
01:16:15,336 --> 01:16:16,530
We're going to stick to the plan.

1545
01:16:16,571 --> 01:16:18,596
You need to let these people know
what's going on...

1546
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,131
Not me. I can't be seen.

1547
01:16:21,175 --> 01:16:24,076
Only you can do this, Roy.
You have to tell them.

1548
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:25,943
OK.

1549
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:28,346
Good luck, Tex.

1550
01:16:30,151 --> 01:16:32,278
I thought the ceremony was tomorrow.

1551
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:33,685
It is. It was.

1552
01:16:33,721 --> 01:16:35,848
This is classic Chuck Muckle.

1553
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:39,451
He pulls this last minute,
flip-flop, flapjack stuff on me all the time.

1554
01:16:39,494 --> 01:16:41,689
He gives me absolutely no respect.

1555
01:16:41,729 --> 01:16:43,697
Oh, don't worry.
He don't respect me neither.

1556
01:16:43,731 --> 01:16:44,720
Mmm-mmm.

1557
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:45,755
Sir, calm down.

1558
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:46,858
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

1559
01:16:46,901 --> 01:16:48,061
Excuse me?

1560
01:16:48,102 --> 01:16:50,070
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

1561
01:16:50,104 --> 01:16:51,093
Mmm!

1562
01:16:51,139 --> 01:16:53,607
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

1563
01:16:53,641 --> 01:16:55,131
Aah!

1564
01:16:55,176 --> 01:16:56,666
What are you trying to say?

1565
01:16:56,711 --> 01:16:58,110
Untie my hands, you idiot.

1566
01:16:58,146 --> 01:16:59,135
Wh... what happened?

1567
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:01,478
I was abducted!
Assaulted! Hog-tied!

1568
01:17:01,516 --> 01:17:02,915
What is going on here?

1569
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:04,043
What happened?

1570
01:17:04,085 --> 01:17:06,952
You get in some kind of
a fishin' accident?

1571
01:17:06,988 --> 01:17:08,421
The vandals did this.
They kidnapped me.

1572
01:17:08,456 --> 01:17:09,582
What's this?

1573
01:17:09,624 --> 01:17:12,092
Now, see, I told you they
was pesky little fellas.

1574
01:17:12,126 --> 01:17:13,718
Will you help me get out of this net?

1575
01:17:13,761 --> 01:17:14,955
We have to get out there!

1576
01:17:14,996 --> 01:17:17,191
Hold on.
Everybody freeze.

1577
01:17:17,231 --> 01:17:20,098
Something's not right
with this environmental report.

1578
01:17:20,134 --> 01:17:23,126
It says there's evidence
of burrowing owls on your property.

1579
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:24,160
Uh-oh.

1580
01:17:24,205 --> 01:17:25,433
Those burrows were
abandoned years ago.

1581
01:17:25,473 --> 01:17:26,804
There are no owls.

1582
01:17:26,841 --> 01:17:29,401
I'm pretty sure this means
your lot needs to be red-tagged...

1583
01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:31,105
and all construction shut down.

1584
01:17:31,145 --> 01:17:33,170
I've got a perfectly good
explanation for this.

1585
01:17:33,214 --> 01:17:34,943
But right now,
I've got to get out there.

1586
01:17:36,217 --> 01:17:37,206
It's a great day
for Coconut Cove...

1587
01:17:37,251 --> 01:17:39,821
This ought to be good.

1588
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:41,652
Mother Paula's is going to be...

1589
01:17:41,689 --> 01:17:46,217
a shining example of my six-point
economic development plan...

1590
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:50,321
bringing to Coconut Cove
over twelve new jobs.

1591
01:17:54,569 --> 01:17:56,161
What's going on?

1592
01:17:56,204 --> 01:17:57,865
Follow my lead.

1593
01:18:01,175 --> 01:18:03,405
Excuse me.

1594
01:18:03,444 --> 01:18:05,071
Who are you?
Where is Muckle?

1595
01:18:05,113 --> 01:18:06,910
He's networking...

1596
01:18:06,948 --> 01:18:08,245
and he asked me
to make an announcement.

1597
01:18:08,282 --> 01:18:10,250
Um, please, Mr. Mayor, take a seat.

1598
01:18:10,284 --> 01:18:12,013
It's OK.

1599
01:18:12,053 --> 01:18:13,748
- All right.
- It's OK.

1600
01:18:28,336 --> 01:18:29,860
Go ahead, Roy.

1601
01:18:34,375 --> 01:18:36,036
Who likes pancakes?

1602
01:18:37,378 --> 01:18:39,278
- We do!
- Love 'em!

1603
01:18:39,313 --> 01:18:40,610
Yeah, me, too.

1604
01:18:40,648 --> 01:18:41,876
I love pancakes.

1605
01:18:41,916 --> 01:18:45,147
And a pancake house will be
great in Coconut Cove.

1606
01:18:45,186 --> 01:18:47,051
But not here.

1607
01:18:47,088 --> 01:18:48,316
Not in this spot...

1608
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:51,519
because somebody was here first
and they still are.

1609
01:18:51,559 --> 01:18:53,527
They're little baby owls.

1610
01:18:53,561 --> 01:18:54,550
- Owls?
- Owls?

1611
01:18:57,799 --> 01:19:02,236
No, not up in the trees,
but in the burrows you see all around.

1612
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:04,761
And if you build a Mother Paula's here...

1613
01:19:04,806 --> 01:19:07,240
you're gonna kill some
really beautiful animals.

1614
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:09,209
Now, just think about that
as you're chowing down...

1615
01:19:09,243 --> 01:19:11,040
on your key lime pie pancakes.

1616
01:19:21,756 --> 01:19:23,314
Oh, no.

1617
01:19:38,673 --> 01:19:40,698
Hey, Coconut Cove!

1618
01:19:40,741 --> 01:19:44,370
Welcome to Pancake House
number one hundred!

1619
01:19:57,391 --> 01:19:59,325
Get out of the way, kid!

1620
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:03,091
You want to bury those owls,
you got to bury me, too!

1621
01:20:04,098 --> 01:20:05,326
Me, too.

1622
01:20:05,366 --> 01:20:07,857
That makes three of us.

1623
01:20:07,902 --> 01:20:10,302
We will not let you kill these owls.

1624
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:14,138
Ladies and gentlemen,
these kids are a little misguided.

1625
01:20:14,175 --> 01:20:16,200
They have no proof of any owls.

1626
01:20:16,244 --> 01:20:18,508
You folks see any owls?
'Cause I don't.

1627
01:20:18,546 --> 01:20:20,173
- No.
- No.

1628
01:20:20,214 --> 01:20:21,704
There sure is owls.

1629
01:20:21,749 --> 01:20:25,879
Why would they come out of their holes
while everybody's here?

1630
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,979
All we do is make noise.

1631
01:20:28,022 --> 01:20:29,489
Cars.

1632
01:20:29,524 --> 01:20:30,821
Trucks.

1633
01:20:30,858 --> 01:20:32,257
Bulldozers.

1634
01:20:32,293 --> 01:20:33,783
All we do is scare them.

1635
01:20:33,828 --> 01:20:35,386
Yeah.

1636
01:20:35,429 --> 01:20:37,260
No wonder we don't see them.

1637
01:20:37,298 --> 01:20:40,199
Maybe if we all just be quiet,
they'll come out.

1638
01:20:57,451 --> 01:20:58,645
Go ahead, Roy.

1639
01:20:58,686 --> 01:21:01,280
Why don't we try it?

1640
01:21:01,322 --> 01:21:03,483
Let's all be quiet for one minute.

1641
01:21:03,524 --> 01:21:05,685
Just sixty seconds, OK?

1642
01:21:05,726 --> 01:21:07,318
This is absurd.

1643
01:21:08,896 --> 01:21:10,022
OK?

1644
01:21:10,064 --> 01:21:11,053
- Yeah.
- Sure.

1645
01:21:11,098 --> 01:21:12,326
Everybody ready?

1646
01:21:12,366 --> 01:21:13,355
Go.

1647
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:15,335
Shh! Shh!

1648
01:21:16,204 --> 01:21:17,193
Quiet. Quiet.

1649
01:21:56,911 --> 01:21:58,139
Roy.

1650
01:21:58,179 --> 01:21:59,840
Look.

1651
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:01,438
Ha ha!

1652
01:22:04,051 --> 01:22:05,040
Check it out.

1653
01:22:07,722 --> 01:22:08,711
Hey, look.

1654
01:22:08,756 --> 01:22:09,916
There's one. There's four.

1655
01:22:09,957 --> 01:22:10,946
- Ha ha.
- Ha ha.

1656
01:22:10,992 --> 01:22:12,289
There's another one.

1657
01:22:12,326 --> 01:22:13,850
Don't scare him.

1658
01:22:15,796 --> 01:22:16,785
I can't believe it.

1659
01:22:20,234 --> 01:22:21,895
Hey, look.
There's one over there.

1660
01:22:25,239 --> 01:22:27,264
Oh, there's another one.

1661
01:22:28,976 --> 01:22:30,102
Oh, my God.

1662
01:22:31,779 --> 01:22:32,768
They're so cute.

1663
01:22:32,813 --> 01:22:35,577
Hey, look!

1664
01:22:35,616 --> 01:22:36,605
Shh! Shh!

1665
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:39,275
Oh, look at that one right there.

1666
01:22:41,956 --> 01:22:43,981
You were right.

1667
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:46,118
Put your hands behind
your back, please, sir.

1668
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:48,287
You're under arrest
for violating state permits...

1669
01:22:48,329 --> 01:22:51,093
operating a bulldozer without a license...

1670
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:52,690
and, uh...

1671
01:22:52,733 --> 01:22:54,200
a lot of other stuff.

1672
01:22:54,235 --> 01:22:56,226
Yay!

1673
01:22:59,907 --> 01:23:01,067
Good job. Good job.

1674
01:23:10,351 --> 01:23:14,481
Ladies and gentlemen
of Coconut Cove.

1675
01:23:14,522 --> 01:23:17,320
Ladies and gentlemen.
Excuse me, Mr. Mayor.

1676
01:23:17,358 --> 01:23:18,723
Ahem.

1677
01:23:18,759 --> 01:23:22,217
I would just like to say
that I, Mother Paula...

1678
01:23:22,263 --> 01:23:26,063
am simply shocked
by what has gone on here today.

1679
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:30,764
And you, young man, are no longer
an employee of Mother Paula's.

1680
01:23:30,805 --> 01:23:31,931
You're fired.

1681
01:23:31,972 --> 01:23:33,166
Yay!

1682
01:23:33,207 --> 01:23:35,072
You can't do that.
She's crazy.

1683
01:23:35,109 --> 01:23:36,508
I do the firing.

1684
01:23:36,544 --> 01:23:38,136
She's only an actress.

1685
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:39,874
Boo!

1686
01:23:39,914 --> 01:23:41,541
And, Mr. Mayor...

1687
01:23:41,582 --> 01:23:44,551
I would like to donate
this land to your town...

1688
01:23:44,585 --> 01:23:47,611
as an owl sanctuary.

1689
01:23:47,655 --> 01:23:49,520
Yay!

1690
01:23:52,126 --> 01:23:54,492
Can she really do that?

1691
01:23:54,528 --> 01:23:55,790
She just did.

1692
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:57,525
And on live TV.

1693
01:23:58,699 --> 01:24:00,189
Mother Paula, that's a grand idea.

1694
01:24:00,234 --> 01:24:02,429
Folks, doesn't that
sound like a grand idea?

1695
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:03,801
Yay!

1696
01:24:03,838 --> 01:24:04,998
And let me assure you...

1697
01:24:05,039 --> 01:24:07,633
my office is going to launch
a full investigation...

1698
01:24:07,675 --> 01:24:11,873
into how the presence
of these fine little creatures...

1699
01:24:11,912 --> 01:24:13,675
was overlooked.

1700
01:24:13,714 --> 01:24:15,181
Yay!

1701
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:16,205
Here we go.

1702
01:24:22,957 --> 01:24:24,948
Guess I owe you an apology, Roy.

1703
01:24:24,992 --> 01:24:27,085
No problem, Officer.
I knew you were all right.

1704
01:24:27,128 --> 01:24:28,117
Thanks.

1705
01:24:28,162 --> 01:24:30,096
And thanks for the... you know.

1706
01:24:30,131 --> 01:24:31,723
It'll come in handy at the trial.

1707
01:24:31,766 --> 01:24:32,790
No problem.

1708
01:24:32,833 --> 01:24:35,927
I couldn't have done any of this
without Beatrice and Mullet Fingers.

1709
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:37,631
Where'd he go?

1710
01:24:43,010 --> 01:24:43,999
Way to go, son.

1711
01:24:53,788 --> 01:24:57,519
Mom and Dad realized they liked Florida
just as much as I did...

1712
01:24:57,558 --> 01:25:00,618
and they decided to stay here
and make this our home.

1713
01:25:00,661 --> 01:25:01,958
For good.

1714
01:25:01,996 --> 01:25:04,965
After all the bad publicity,
the pancake company...

1715
01:25:04,999 --> 01:25:08,526
couldn't back off the promises
made that day by Mother Paula.

1716
01:25:08,569 --> 01:25:11,629
They ended up donating the land
as a wildlife preserve.

1717
01:25:11,672 --> 01:25:13,435
The owls are still there...

1718
01:25:13,474 --> 01:25:16,102
and you could see them
if you're real quiet.

1719
01:25:16,143 --> 01:25:20,978
Beatrice and I became best of friends
and I never missed a soccer game.

1720
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:23,449
Attendance was mandatory.

1721
01:25:23,484 --> 01:25:24,644
Left! Right!

1722
01:25:24,685 --> 01:25:27,654
Then there's Dana Matherson,
who finally met someone...

1723
01:25:27,688 --> 01:25:30,054
who was bigger and meaner than he was.

1724
01:25:30,090 --> 01:25:32,115
What is your major malfunction,
Chucklebutt?

1725
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:33,990
You've got the posture of a jellyfish!

1726
01:25:34,028 --> 01:25:38,124
Officer Delinko was promoted
to his dream job as a detective...

1727
01:25:38,165 --> 01:25:41,032
and got his first
unmarked patrol car.

1728
01:25:41,068 --> 01:25:42,057
Ahh!

1729
01:25:42,102 --> 01:25:47,130
Two days later, he accidentally
backed it off a fishing pier.

1730
01:25:47,174 --> 01:25:49,802
While serving his ninety days
of community service...

1731
01:25:49,844 --> 01:25:52,642
Chuck Muckle was hit in the head
by a falling coconut.

1732
01:25:56,650 --> 01:26:00,609
The judge gave him another thirty days
for lying down on the job.

1733
01:26:00,654 --> 01:26:03,680
Curly Brannit quit his job
at Mother Paula's.

1734
01:26:03,724 --> 01:26:07,660
Today, he brags that his life
has gone to the dogs.

1735
01:26:07,695 --> 01:26:10,391
Last, but not least,
is Mullet Fingers.

1736
01:26:10,431 --> 01:26:12,695
Well, whenever he wants
to get together...

1737
01:26:12,733 --> 01:26:15,793
he has his own secret way
of letting me know.

1738
01:26:18,072 --> 01:26:22,475
# Good guys win
every once in a while #

1739
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:26,913
# Full grown men
get to learn from a child #

1740
01:26:26,947 --> 01:26:29,313
# Now and then
just when you think... #

1741
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:34,344
And Florida had its own way
of keeping us real busy.

1742
01:26:34,388 --> 01:26:37,949
# But good guys win #

1743
01:26:44,832 --> 01:26:48,202
# Good guys win
every once in a while #

1744
01:26:49,036 --> 01:26:53,439
# Full grown men
get to learn from a child #

1745
01:26:53,474 --> 01:26:55,635
# Now and then #

1746
01:26:55,676 --> 01:27:00,909
# Just when you think
it won't happen again #

1747
01:27:00,948 --> 01:27:04,315
# The good guys win #

1748
01:27:08,522 --> 01:27:12,549
# So you're lookin' for a hero #

1749
01:27:12,593 --> 01:27:17,428
# That you can see
with your own eyes #

1750
01:27:17,464 --> 01:27:20,433
# When they don't wear
the mask and cape #

1751
01:27:20,467 --> 01:27:24,267
# They're hard to recognize #

1752
01:27:27,107 --> 01:27:30,975
# Even though
these are cynical times #

1753
01:27:31,011 --> 01:27:33,206
# Bear it in mind #

1754
01:27:33,247 --> 01:27:37,547
# Good guys win
every once in a while #

1755
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:41,954
# Full-grown men
