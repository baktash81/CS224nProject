1
00:00:03,383 --> 00:00:08,343
Let's get ready to rock and roll. Tally
Atwater Affiliate Promo. Take one.

2
00:00:08,388 --> 00:00:10,356
Okay, people, let's get it
together. Let's do it.

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,349
We need Tally on one.
I wanna hear the announce.

4
00:00:14,394 --> 00:00:16,362
We'll take the announcement. Tally?

5
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:21,367
Testing one, two, three.

6
00:00:21,401 --> 00:00:26,361
This is Tom Orr.
Testing one, two, three.

7
00:00:33,413 --> 00:00:37,372
You know those faces,
you remember those stories.

8
00:00:37,417 --> 00:00:41,376
They were the men and women
who made I.B.S. News...

9
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:44,390
Okay, that's enough on Tom Orr.
Let's go to Tally.

10
00:00:44,424 --> 00:00:47,393
Hey, kill the music, guys.

11
00:00:47,427 --> 00:00:51,386
Tally, could you give us
a level on your mike, please?

12
00:00:51,431 --> 00:00:54,400
- What we in the news business...
- One second. Mike, raise her beam.

13
00:00:54,434 --> 00:00:57,403
Again, Tally,
testing one, two, three.

14
00:00:57,437 --> 00:01:00,338
What we in the news business
can never forget...

15
00:01:00,374 --> 00:01:05,334
You're pickin'up shadow on her face.
Tally, I need to see you at camera here.

16
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,349
Add some side light, please.

17
00:01:09,383 --> 00:01:12,352
What we in the news business
can never forget...

18
00:01:12,386 --> 00:01:15,355
is we're only as good as
the stories we tell.

19
00:01:15,389 --> 00:01:20,349
Guys, you still got the shadow.
A little more fill, please.

20
00:01:20,394 --> 00:01:25,354
If you could talk a little about how
you got started. Afew bio-bites.

21
00:01:29,403 --> 00:01:31,371
Let's see.

22
00:01:31,405 --> 00:01:34,374
I guess I always pretty much
knew what I wanted to do.

23
00:01:34,408 --> 00:01:39,368
Sallyanne knew what she wanted. And
what she wanted was to be number 1.

24
00:01:39,413 --> 00:01:44,373
- In neon lights.
- The sister comes down to two bites.

25
00:01:44,418 --> 00:01:49,378
There's something cute about how you
got started. You went to college?

26
00:01:49,423 --> 00:01:54,383
I tempted, waited tables. The minute
I was old enough, I dealt craps.

27
00:01:54,428 --> 00:01:58,387
I wanted deal baccarat, because
you could make more money on tips.

28
00:01:58,432 --> 00:02:03,335
But where we were living, in a
little mining town in the West...

29
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,338
you had to be connected
to deal baccarat.

30
00:02:05,372 --> 00:02:09,331
And the only person I was connected
to was my little sister, Luanne.

31
00:02:09,376 --> 00:02:13,335
I was going to community
college at night...

32
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,340
doubling up on communications courses,
making up for lost time.

33
00:02:19,386 --> 00:02:22,355
Everyone said...

34
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:24,357
"You wanna get a job in television...

35
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:28,350
you have to make a demo tape."
So, I made a demo tape.

36
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:33,355
You might ask, "Out of the thousands of
women that send tapes, why hire Sally?"

37
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,360
I sent it to thirty-seven stations.
W.M.I.A. Miami...

38
00:02:38,405 --> 00:02:42,364
was the only answer I got. So I said
I said good-bye to Luanne and got...

39
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:47,369
on the American connection to Dallas
with a four hour lay-over to Miami.

40
00:02:47,414 --> 00:02:51,373
I wanted it to be four days,
I was so scared of getting there.

41
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,359
So, you're Sally.

42
00:03:33,393 --> 00:03:37,352
- Thally Atwater.
- That's Sally with an "S", right?

43
00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:41,356
- Do you thing l'm overdressed?
- No. Not in the least.

44
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:45,360
I didn't know if it'd be...
you know dressy or... cool...

45
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:51,366
Warren? Ms. Atwater is here.

46
00:03:51,411 --> 00:03:55,370
Okay, go up those stairs and
Warren's in the control booth.

47
00:03:55,415 --> 00:03:59,317
- Hey. I'm Ned.
- I'm Sally.

48
00:04:00,353 --> 00:04:02,321
You majored in communications.

49
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:06,314
Yeah, Vic, listen. On that Coco
Plum housekeeper murder...

50
00:04:38,391 --> 00:04:41,360
- Wrap Patti, go to Rob.
- Patti, wrap it up.

51
00:04:41,394 --> 00:04:45,353
- For now, Rob. Back to you, Stewart.
- Thank you, Patti, for that report.

52
00:04:45,398 --> 00:04:48,367
You, over here.
Rob, you're running long.

53
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:52,360
Further developments as they occur at
the situation at Tamiami Middle School.

54
00:04:52,405 --> 00:04:56,364
Further developments as they occur at
the situation at Tamiami Middle...

55
00:04:56,409 --> 00:05:01,312
A thirteen-years-old still holds his
math class hostage with an A.K.

56
00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:06,308
More coverage at six from the award-
winning Channel Nine News Team.

57
00:05:06,353 --> 00:05:12,314
This is Rob Sullivan with his touchy,
feel tag. Good-bye. Be of good cheer.

58
00:05:14,361 --> 00:05:19,321
I might get sick.
Get me the six o'clock report.

59
00:05:21,368 --> 00:05:24,337
- Come on.
- About the Anders sentencing today...

60
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:26,339
Coming, sweetheart?

61
00:05:26,373 --> 00:05:30,332
...is by calling attention to public
servant violating the voter's trust.

62
00:05:30,377 --> 00:05:33,346
No, Harvey, we play it straight.

63
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,339
"Harvey Harris reporting from the
Courthouse where the Seminole School...

64
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:41,343
Principal was found guilty of banging the
tenth grade class president. No more.

65
00:05:41,388 --> 00:05:43,356
That accident in Homestead...

66
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,359
- Sweetheart, will you keep up?
- Sally.

67
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:50,352
- Excuse?
- Sally. Not "sweetheart."

68
00:05:51,398 --> 00:05:53,366
Got it. Vic. Sally.

69
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,360
Sally's our new desk assistant.
Do not call her "sweetheart."

70
00:05:58,405 --> 00:06:04,310
- There's got a kid trapped.
- No kid. Dad, Mom, Grandma in one car.

71
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:07,313
The driver, his wife or
girlfriend in the pickup.

72
00:06:07,347 --> 00:06:09,315
- There's some discrepancy there.
- Run that discrepancy by me.

73
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:13,308
Lady calls, says the woman in the
pickup was her "husband's whore."

74
00:06:13,353 --> 00:06:16,322
Warren? Trish again on two.

75
00:06:16,356 --> 00:06:20,315
Trish?
Yeah, we'll send you references.

76
00:06:21,361 --> 00:06:24,330
Weren't you and Trish... You know,
if you don't mind my asking?

77
00:06:24,364 --> 00:06:30,325
- I do mind. Who you got on Homested?
- Nobody. Unless you unfire Trish.

78
00:06:34,374 --> 00:06:39,334
We don't usually wear out
credentials in the newsroom.

79
00:06:44,384 --> 00:06:46,352
Oh, I'm sorry.

80
00:06:47,387 --> 00:06:50,356
- Oh, that's good.
- I'm sorry.

81
00:06:58,398 --> 00:07:01,299
I'm from Nevada.

82
00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:04,303
Okay, here's the rundown.

83
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:09,297
- We'll have the kid hostage story live.
- No. It'll be "What-does-it-all-mean?"

84
00:07:10,343 --> 00:07:12,311
Have Lou do it.

85
00:07:12,345 --> 00:07:16,304
Consuela's doing the P.B.A. Endorsing
the mayor for second term.

86
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:18,317
Bury that before the first commercial.

87
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:22,310
Harvey's doing Anders, and there's the
Coco Plum housekeeper killing.

88
00:07:22,355 --> 00:07:24,323
Lead with that. Because...

89
00:07:25,358 --> 00:07:28,327
Come on. Let's have it.
The golden rule of local news.

90
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:32,320
"If... it...

91
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:36,335
bleed, it leads."

92
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:38,337
- Your predecessor...
- Trish...

93
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:41,340
Trish didn't think the desk had a
whole lot to teach her. How 'bout you?

94
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:45,333
- I think the desk can teach me.
- What?

95
00:07:45,378 --> 00:07:47,346
- Everything.
- Everything?

96
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:51,350
So... that later when I'm...

97
00:07:52,385 --> 00:07:55,354
So when I'm ready,
I'll be able to do a story.

98
00:07:55,388 --> 00:07:57,356
Excuse me a second.

99
00:08:00,326 --> 00:08:05,286
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
This is a great honor...

100
00:08:08,334 --> 00:08:12,293
...already a seasoned newswoman.
She covered crucial...

101
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:16,297
Crucial California Youth
Forum Elections?

102
00:08:16,342 --> 00:08:21,302
You might ask, "Out of the thousands of
women that send tapes, why hire Sally?"

103
00:08:21,347 --> 00:08:25,306
Because I'm Sally,
and I'm going to be a star.

104
00:08:25,351 --> 00:08:30,311
If it is to tell me I have a lot to
learn, I already know that.

105
00:08:30,356 --> 00:08:33,325
- I'm going to learn it.
- Noted.

106
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:37,318
Meanwhile, you answer the phones,
work the data-base...

107
00:08:37,363 --> 00:08:40,332
get the reporters what they need...
addresses, numbers.

108
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:42,334
Who, what, when, where.

109
00:08:42,368 --> 00:08:47,328
And you see that Mister Coffee machine
over there? I like it strong.

110
00:08:47,373 --> 00:08:50,342
Lleana, cancel my dinner.
We're gonna have to go late.

111
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:53,345
You used to cover the White House.

112
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:57,338
- You'll tell me you watched me?
- You asked George Bush how...

113
00:08:57,383 --> 00:09:02,286
as former C.I.A. Director, he didn't
know Noriega was on the C.I.A. Payroll.

114
00:09:02,322 --> 00:09:08,283
Bush said, "No questions at photo op."
And you put the whole thing on the air.

115
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:13,288
- It was in a course I took.
- You still get the coffee.

116
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,302
- I could probably get the coffee.
- Good.

117
00:09:16,336 --> 00:09:20,295
Otherwise you'd just have the shortest
career in W.M.I.A. Channel Nine History.

118
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:25,300
News Heartbeat of the American
Riviera. Sugar, no cream.

119
00:09:25,345 --> 00:09:28,314
You always wear that much makeup?

120
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:39,314
Turning to the weather front, looks
like scorchers stacked up over Florida.

121
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:41,327
Newsroom.

122
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:44,330
May I have your name, please?

123
00:09:44,364 --> 00:09:46,332
And what is the name of the hospital?

124
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:50,336
Does this person have a name?

125
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,339
No, I am trying to help you.

126
00:09:53,373 --> 00:09:58,333
No, ma'am. I do not remember
Miami before there were Haitians.

127
00:09:58,378 --> 00:10:02,337
Thank you, ma'am.
Happy Halloween to you, too.

128
00:10:02,382 --> 00:10:05,351
- You're gettin' the hang of it.
I am, yes.

129
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:09,344
Actually, I've been getting the
hang of it since at least July.

130
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:11,357
- Here you go, Warren.
- Thanks. Good, Ned.

131
00:10:11,391 --> 00:10:16,351
This is not a criticism,
it's more of an observation.

132
00:10:16,396 --> 00:10:20,355
- You don't have a weather person.
- I fired her. I don't like it.

133
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,369
But having the anchor do the weather
reduces his credibility as anchor.

134
00:10:23,403 --> 00:10:27,362
- Credibility? Rob?
- Lf you wanted someone to do it...

135
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:30,376
...you think you might be ready to...
...take in a little more...

136
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:34,369
...responsibility?
- Exactly. I'm already.

137
00:10:35,415 --> 00:10:37,383
You know what you are ready for?

138
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:43,378
You can stop tomorrow morning on your
way in. My cleaning. Shun Lee.

139
00:10:43,423 --> 00:10:44,390
You want a ride home?

140
00:10:44,424 --> 00:10:48,383
Otherwise I've just had the shortest
career in the History of W.M.I. A...

141
00:10:48,428 --> 00:10:55,391
- News Heartbeat of American Riviera.
- The ride home is optional.

142
00:10:56,436 --> 00:10:59,337
I opt no, thank you.

143
00:11:15,388 --> 00:11:19,347
- You want Rob to wear that?
- You know, weather is sponsored spot.

144
00:11:19,392 --> 00:11:22,361
What if it's not raining, Dan?
Any other costume ideas on tap?

145
00:11:22,395 --> 00:11:26,354
I was thinking maybe
big sunglasses if... Shit.

146
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,368
Warren, Three has happy weather.

147
00:11:29,402 --> 00:11:33,361
Three? The night
the Gulf War started...

148
00:11:33,406 --> 00:11:37,365
they led with a Bal Harbour Winter
Wonderland Shopathon.

149
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:41,369
And Three is the top-rated station in
this market. What could it cost to try?

150
00:11:41,414 --> 00:11:44,383
- It would could cost you nothing.
- Give me a second.

151
00:11:51,424 --> 00:11:56,384
- I said I wanted them boxed.
- They still don't come boxed.

152
00:11:58,431 --> 00:12:02,333
- I was watching the news last night...
- Is that unusual?

153
00:12:02,368 --> 00:12:07,328
...and I have an idea about something.
I was rethinking the weather spot.

154
00:12:07,373 --> 00:12:08,340
Yeah, everybody is.

155
00:12:08,374 --> 00:12:11,343
I could do the desk and the weather...

156
00:12:11,377 --> 00:12:14,346
...same salary.
- Lf I could restate my point...

157
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,339
- I got it. Salary to one side, Sally.
- I did some weather in Reno.

158
00:12:18,384 --> 00:12:21,353
I wanted to hire regular weather,
an Arnie Poole type.

159
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:24,356
San Francisco's got Arnie Poole.
We've got Rob.

160
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:28,349
- All I ask to let Rob try this.
- The weather in Reno. Let's see.

161
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:31,363
They must get some
genuine weather there, huh?

162
00:12:31,397 --> 00:12:34,366
- Oh, big time.
- You prove me wrong, I'm easy.

163
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,368
Dan...

164
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:39,371
meet our new weather person.

165
00:12:39,405 --> 00:12:42,374
Really? Really?

166
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:46,367
This is Dan Duarte, our station
manager and my boss.

167
00:12:46,412 --> 00:12:50,371
I go through life with a smile,
try to spread a little goodness.

168
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:54,375
You know, some people in this
business getjaded because...

169
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:58,379
it's always the same awful stories.
And it is the same stories.

170
00:12:58,424 --> 00:13:02,326
But they're happening to
different people.

171
00:13:02,361 --> 00:13:06,320
Our new weather gal seems
to be under the weather.

172
00:13:06,365 --> 00:13:08,333
Thirty seconds, Rob.

173
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:11,336
Focus on spreading that goodness, Rob.

174
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:23,337
What is this? Okay, come on.
Let's get up.

175
00:13:25,384 --> 00:13:27,352
- Now, what is it?
- Oh, I can't do it.

176
00:13:27,386 --> 00:13:30,355
Now, you've done this before.

177
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:33,358
If you're Sally,
I want you in makeup now, please.

178
00:13:33,392 --> 00:13:36,361
Not now. Wait outside.

179
00:13:38,397 --> 00:13:41,366
- Say, "Sally Atwater." Say it.
- Thally.

180
00:13:43,402 --> 00:13:45,370
Thally.

181
00:13:45,404 --> 00:13:47,372
- Say it.
- Thally Atw...

182
00:13:47,406 --> 00:13:51,365
- No, I can't do it!
- Then don't do.

183
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,378
You don't have to do it.

184
00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:56,381
- Yes, I do.
- What?

185
00:13:56,415 --> 00:14:00,317
- Yes, I do.
- Okay. I'll get you through it.

186
00:14:00,353 --> 00:14:04,312
I'm your floor manager. You're gonna
be on camera two the entire time.

187
00:14:04,357 --> 00:14:11,320
Okay, everybody, happy weather! In
fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve...

188
00:14:11,364 --> 00:14:13,332
Okay, everybody...

189
00:14:13,366 --> 00:14:16,335
Keep on your toes.
Let's do this one for Uncle Dan.

190
00:14:19,372 --> 00:14:22,341
Rob, check the prompter.

191
00:14:24,377 --> 00:14:26,345
And now with the weather, here's Sa...

192
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,349
Tally Atwater. Tally?

193
00:14:31,384 --> 00:14:35,343
It's your new name. It's easy to say.
don't look at me, look at the camera.

194
00:14:35,388 --> 00:14:37,356
You got twenty-nine
seconds to commercial.

195
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:41,349
Talk straight into the red light. You
will find you've got a new best friend.

196
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:46,365
Tally?

197
00:14:50,403 --> 00:14:52,371
Come on, baby.

198
00:14:54,407 --> 00:14:56,375
Thanks, Rob.

199
00:14:56,409 --> 00:15:00,311
How long was that? Okay, we need to
lake thirty seconds off the close.

200
00:15:00,346 --> 00:15:01,313
What an idea.

201
00:15:01,347 --> 00:15:05,306
We will want these, because it's
heat, heat and more heat.

202
00:15:05,351 --> 00:15:07,319
Oh, another good idea, Dan.

203
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:10,322
We're looking at an expected high
of ninety-eight.

204
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:14,315
- Sunglasses don't look silly on Seven.
- Will she come out next with a banana?

205
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,319
When the sun goes down, look for a
balmy low of eighty-six.

206
00:15:18,364 --> 00:15:23,324
- Pick it up.
- More high pressure moving in means...

207
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:25,337
Pace yourself.

208
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:29,330
don't look at me.
Look at the camera.

209
00:15:30,376 --> 00:15:33,345
And so the five-day
forecast is more...

210
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:36,348
...more, more hot, hot, hot. Thtay...

211
00:15:40,386 --> 00:15:46,347
Stay inside, cuddle up and
enjoy the air conditioning. Rob.

212
00:15:48,394 --> 00:15:52,353
You made your point, Warren.
This is a non-starter.

213
00:15:52,398 --> 00:15:55,367
She eats the lens.

214
00:15:58,404 --> 00:16:02,306
This is Robin Sullivan saying,
for Adela Syms and myself...

215
00:16:02,341 --> 00:16:07,301
and all of us here at Channel Nine
News good night. Be of good cheer.

216
00:16:07,346 --> 00:16:10,315
Won't want this.

217
00:16:10,349 --> 00:16:13,318
Will need these.

218
00:16:14,353 --> 00:16:19,313
Not to worry, Dan. Uncle Rob was
there to step in if it got any worse.

219
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,329
- Good job, Sally.
- I was betting she'd pee on air.

220
00:16:24,363 --> 00:16:29,323
- I've never seen anything like it.
- We'll do it again tomorrow, okay?

221
00:16:47,386 --> 00:16:50,355
You don't have to put up
with him, Lu.

222
00:16:53,392 --> 00:16:57,351
Luanne, I hear it. I hear it.

223
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,301
No, it is not the guy from
the sweepstakes.

224
00:17:02,335 --> 00:17:08,296
Nobody but you believes in the guy from
sweepstakes. It's like the tooth fairy.

225
00:17:09,342 --> 00:17:12,311
Wait, don't hang up!
I wanna talk to you.

226
00:17:13,346 --> 00:17:17,305
- You're feeling sorry for yourself?
- What are you doing here?

227
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:22,310
N.B.C.'s million dollar baby
and how she got there.

228
00:17:22,355 --> 00:17:26,314
No Miami Herald, no Washington Post,
no Wall Street Journal?

229
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,327
You getting a cheap rush from this?

230
00:17:29,362 --> 00:17:31,330
You know the demo tape I sent you?

231
00:17:32,365 --> 00:17:34,333
I faked it.

232
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:40,328
I didn't do any of those things. I
went to East Reno Community College.

233
00:17:40,373 --> 00:17:45,333
I wasn't valedictorian. I didn't
graduate. I rented a cap and gown.

234
00:17:45,378 --> 00:17:48,347
I did the camera myself.
I even threw the confetti myself.

235
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:52,340
No crucial California Youth Forum
Elections? Big time weather?

236
00:17:52,385 --> 00:17:55,354
Once when I was working at...

237
00:17:56,389 --> 00:17:59,290
Cal-Neva, there, it got snowed in.

238
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:02,294
And a Reno station asked for
some report...

239
00:18:02,328 --> 00:18:07,288
phone reports, and I did one.
It was forty seconds long.

240
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:11,292
- I know all that. I checked it out.
- So, fire me.

241
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:15,296
If you're hungry enough to fake it,
you might be hungry enough to do it.

242
00:18:15,341 --> 00:18:19,300
- The weather is not gonna work.
- You don't think I know that?

243
00:18:19,345 --> 00:18:24,305
You come across on camera.
I'm giving you a shot as reporter.

244
00:18:25,351 --> 00:18:28,320
That's what I came by to tell you.

245
00:18:31,357 --> 00:18:35,316
You thought I came by to
fuck you, didn't you?

246
00:18:39,365 --> 00:18:43,324
Lu! I think I just got promoted.

247
00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:56,348
Actually, this is a set-aside.

248
00:18:56,382 --> 00:19:00,284
Harvey's Belle Glade piece tells
me a story. Yours doesn't.

249
00:19:02,321 --> 00:19:05,290
Miami's beautiful people
got an eyeful today...

250
00:19:05,324 --> 00:19:07,292
- What's the story?
- The story is...

251
00:19:07,326 --> 00:19:10,295
The fashion industry comes
to South Beach.

252
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:14,288
It came. It went.
We did that story. It's gone.

253
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:19,293
Now let's lay in B roll and see
if we can't salvage this thing.

254
00:19:22,341 --> 00:19:26,300
Some of the finest cigar makers
exiled from Cuba...

255
00:19:26,345 --> 00:19:29,314
are making profitable businesses
here in Little Havana.

256
00:19:29,348 --> 00:19:32,317
As I quickly learned,
it's not as easy as it looks.

257
00:19:32,351 --> 00:19:35,320
What's the story here? Is it the Cuban?
Or are you getting cute with the cigar?

258
00:19:35,354 --> 00:19:38,323
This is Tally Atwater, Channel
Nine News, in Little Havana.

259
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:39,324
The Cuban, of course.

260
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:43,317
Then you should've found out that this
particular exiled cigar maker...

261
00:19:43,362 --> 00:19:46,331
is not from Havana,
but a Batista officer.

262
00:19:47,366 --> 00:19:49,334
- Just do it better.
- Right.

263
00:19:52,371 --> 00:19:57,331
Harvey's truck is down.
On his way to...

264
00:19:58,377 --> 00:20:00,345
How long would it take us
to get to Miami Beach?

265
00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:04,338
I thought we're doing
this bullshit boat show.

266
00:20:04,383 --> 00:20:08,342
- This' a much better story. How long?
- Half an hour.

267
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:11,356
Vic... Yeah, Tally.

268
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:15,349
Listen, Ned and I are moments
from this Harvey story.

269
00:20:45,424 --> 00:20:50,384
- Harvey's truck is down.
- I'm covering till he gets here.

270
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:54,388
But if he doesn't get here you'll
need an on-camera reporter.

271
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:58,392
You've never done a live feed. You
don't even know what the story is.

272
00:20:58,437 --> 00:21:03,340
Get the boat, get the cable, get the
balconies. Get the spokesman.

273
00:21:04,376 --> 00:21:07,345
Then tell me what the story is.

274
00:21:09,381 --> 00:21:12,350
Okay, show me what you got.

275
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:22,349
Get in there.
Jam the damn mike in his face.

276
00:21:23,395 --> 00:21:24,362
Hey, wait a minute!

277
00:21:24,396 --> 00:21:28,355
- We have to make a positive I.D. First.
- How do you do that, Sheriff?

278
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,359
- Metro-Dade, missy.
- How do you make a positive I.D.?

279
00:21:32,404 --> 00:21:36,363
I know she's never done a live feed.
So, if she can't cut it, I'll do it.

280
00:21:36,408 --> 00:21:41,368
- We can call this one Juan Doe.
- His name is Juan Doe?

281
00:21:43,415 --> 00:21:46,384
Or is that your way of suggesting that
this particular John Doe...

282
00:21:46,418 --> 00:21:50,377
or unidentified person, or
was Spanish speaking?

283
00:21:50,422 --> 00:21:55,382
Cute, missy. I'm gonna ask y'all to
bear with us and be patient here.

284
00:21:56,428 --> 00:21:59,329
- First thing, stay upwind.
- Which way is upwind?

285
00:21:59,365 --> 00:22:03,324
Away from the sting. Floaters stink
because their stomach's full of gas.

286
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:07,328
That's what brings them up. Sometimes
they pop. We can shoot right here.

287
00:22:07,373 --> 00:22:10,342
But they're over there...

288
00:22:10,376 --> 00:22:13,345
Raul Sota, Domingo Katz. Colombians.

289
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:17,338
Deck hands on the S.S. Bolivar out of
Barranquilla. Theyjumped ship.

290
00:22:17,383 --> 00:22:21,342
I called the harbor master. Calling
the harbor master what reporters do.

291
00:22:21,387 --> 00:22:25,346
- Raul Sota and Domingo Katz.
- We're still too close.

292
00:22:25,391 --> 00:22:28,360
The storm that slammed
into Miami yesterday...

293
00:22:28,394 --> 00:22:31,363
Forget yesterday. Yesterday's
history. News happens today.

294
00:22:31,397 --> 00:22:35,356
- Forget yesterday. Today, okay.
- Shoulder facing camera so Ned can...

295
00:22:35,401 --> 00:22:39,360
- I'm gonna faint. Where's upwind?
- Not where you're at. Vic?

296
00:22:39,405 --> 00:22:42,374
Are you with me?
How much time have we got?

297
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:47,368
A minute and twelve seconds to come
up with the lead-in, okay?

298
00:22:47,413 --> 00:22:51,372
This isn't about lipstick. This is
about them. Two guysjumped ship...

299
00:22:51,417 --> 00:22:55,376
for the land of plenty, and they
drown 25 feet from getting it.

300
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:58,390
People like Sota and Katz don't
get taught how to swim.

301
00:22:58,424 --> 00:23:02,326
That's what this story's about,
not makeup. Vic? One minute.

302
00:23:03,362 --> 00:23:07,321
- In the blue water off Miami today...
- Miami Beach today.

303
00:23:07,366 --> 00:23:10,335
Raul Sota, Domingo Katz. What did
they die for? What did they want?

304
00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:13,338
In the blue water off
Miami Beach today, divers...

305
00:23:13,372 --> 00:23:18,332
Hold the divers. Lead with Sota and
Katz. I'll tell you what to say.

306
00:23:18,377 --> 00:23:20,345
- I know what to say.
- Well, then say it!

307
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:23,348
Raul Sota and Domingo Ka...

308
00:23:23,382 --> 00:23:27,341
25 feet from the big enchilada.
25 feet from the promise land.

309
00:23:27,386 --> 00:23:32,346
25 feet from walking down Colliens
Avenue and a job bussing dishes.

310
00:23:32,391 --> 00:23:36,350
- Did you want something that bad?
- Ten seconds.

311
00:23:36,395 --> 00:23:38,363
- Answer me. Do you?
- Yes!

312
00:23:38,397 --> 00:23:42,356
- Then show me.
- She's on in seven seconds. Six.

313
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:47,361
- Tell me a story.
- Five. Four. Three...

314
00:23:48,407 --> 00:23:51,376
Two men drowned today off Miami Beach.

315
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,378
Raul Sota and Domingo Katz...

316
00:23:53,412 --> 00:23:58,372
didn't belong in the luxurious cabanas
that line this beach. Theyjumped ship.

317
00:23:58,417 --> 00:24:01,318
They wanted to come to America.
And they died...

318
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:04,322
25 feet from what they must have
seen as the promised land.

319
00:24:04,356 --> 00:24:07,325
Were these men seeking asylum?

320
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,329
All we know is that a pilgrimage...

321
00:24:11,363 --> 00:24:14,332
to El Norte that began in
Barranquilla, Columbia...

322
00:24:14,366 --> 00:24:18,325
spelled death today for
Raul Sota and Domingo Katz.

323
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:22,329
This is Tally Atwater
on Miami Beach.

324
00:24:22,374 --> 00:24:25,343
Girl's got chops.

325
00:24:29,381 --> 00:24:31,349
Thank you.

326
00:24:31,383 --> 00:24:34,352
I was wondering if you could say that.

327
00:24:46,398 --> 00:24:50,357
- It was nice work on the aliens.
- Thanks.

328
00:24:50,402 --> 00:24:54,361
It made me reflect on
how many of them...

329
00:24:55,407 --> 00:25:00,310
every day, actually get in.
Food for thought.

330
00:25:02,347 --> 00:25:04,315
I'd never thought of it that way, Rob.

331
00:25:04,349 --> 00:25:07,318
A little advice from Uncle Rob?

332
00:25:08,353 --> 00:25:14,314
Watch Warren. don't let him
bring you along too fast.

333
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,329
You feel you need a mentor...

334
00:25:18,363 --> 00:25:22,322
- Roberino.
- Thanks.

335
00:25:40,385 --> 00:25:46,346
On tonight's Assignment Earth,
Selling Dirty Air."

336
00:25:57,402 --> 00:26:01,304
When Oriana Fallaci interviewed
Fidel Castro, she did it in Spanish.

337
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:05,299
Before you set up your
one-on-one with Fidel...

338
00:26:05,344 --> 00:26:08,313
you might wanna get a new
jacket, or two.

339
00:26:08,347 --> 00:26:11,316
We have a consultant that
we use, Inez Cifuentes.

340
00:26:13,352 --> 00:26:18,312
We have a budget for it. We don't
want the look to get in the way.

341
00:26:25,364 --> 00:26:28,333
Warren said to keep a little edge.

342
00:26:32,371 --> 00:26:35,340
It's a when-did-you-stop-beating-
your-wife kind of deal.

343
00:26:35,374 --> 00:26:39,333
Diaz isn't doing to admit
he's taking money from Cali.

344
00:26:39,378 --> 00:26:43,337
If you can get him not answering the
question, then you've told the story.

345
00:26:43,382 --> 00:26:46,351
Another thing, if...
Well, that's nice.

346
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:50,355
Edgy enough for you?

347
00:26:52,391 --> 00:26:55,360
Inez, you can do something
about the hair?

348
00:26:58,397 --> 00:27:00,297
I'm not cutting my hair.

349
00:27:00,332 --> 00:27:02,300
Ned, run, get ahead of me.

350
00:27:03,335 --> 00:27:05,303
Excuse me.

351
00:27:05,337 --> 00:27:08,306
Toda la familia...

352
00:27:12,344 --> 00:27:16,303
How do you answer allegations that
you profited from drug money?

353
00:27:16,348 --> 00:27:18,316
That is no longer an issue.

354
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:21,319
Isn't it true that your campaign
received sizable contributions...

355
00:27:21,353 --> 00:27:25,312
Do you have vaginal or
clitoral orgasms?

356
00:27:26,358 --> 00:27:31,318
Isn't it true you prefer fellatio
although you're a practicing lesbian?

357
00:27:31,363 --> 00:27:33,331
Would you like to clear
up these allegations?

358
00:27:33,365 --> 00:27:37,324
Tell him I got the mother
of the sex-change boy.

359
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:40,338
Because Donahe has the sex-change boy.

360
00:27:41,373 --> 00:27:44,342
I know she's a second-tier get.
I also she's available.

361
00:27:44,376 --> 00:27:49,336
200 years of a free press and we've
down to the sex-change boy?

362
00:27:49,381 --> 00:27:54,341
There's nothing big here.
Just get me into Havana on Thursday.

363
00:27:54,386 --> 00:27:56,354
Three, two, one.

364
00:27:57,389 --> 00:28:02,292
Behind those smoked glass windows
in downtown Miami today...

365
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:05,296
I bet that one's yours.

366
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:08,299
- You win.
- Got it?

367
00:28:09,334 --> 00:28:11,302
Asshole Diaz.

368
00:28:12,337 --> 00:28:15,306
Tally Atwater, Joanna Kennelly.

369
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:19,310
Joanna's my ex-wife.

370
00:28:20,345 --> 00:28:22,313
Well, one of them.

371
00:28:22,347 --> 00:28:26,306
The one that left me in Washington,
not in New Orleans.

372
00:28:26,351 --> 00:28:32,312
- Joanna's on her way to Havana.
- Why don't you come with me?

373
00:28:33,358 --> 00:28:38,318
- Do you expect to talk to Diaz?
- Let me show the beauty of news.

374
00:28:38,363 --> 00:28:43,323
- I wanted to get him on camera. I did.
- Of course you did.

375
00:28:43,368 --> 00:28:46,337
Get plenty of ambient noise, okay?
And balloons.

376
00:28:47,372 --> 00:28:50,341
- How would you do it?
- Oh, perfectly.

377
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:52,343
I love balloons.

378
00:28:58,383 --> 00:29:02,285
- Here, look at this.
- Congressman!

379
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,288
Is it true you prefer fellatio?

380
00:29:04,322 --> 00:29:06,290
Watch this.

381
00:29:09,327 --> 00:29:12,296
And you dissolve from the window...

382
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,298
to you, like this.

383
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,300
And then...

384
00:29:18,336 --> 00:29:20,304
I'm gonna lay in the sound.

385
00:29:21,339 --> 00:29:25,298
Behind those smoked glass windows
in downtown Miami today...

386
00:29:25,343 --> 00:29:28,312
is Congressman Jorge Diaz...

387
00:29:31,349 --> 00:29:33,317
So...

388
00:29:33,351 --> 00:29:36,320
- You and Joanna...
- Joanna...

389
00:29:37,355 --> 00:29:41,314
thought I was a Capitol Hill insider,
which, at the time, I was.

390
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:45,318
We were a cute couple on the
Sunday shows for a while.

391
00:29:45,363 --> 00:29:49,322
But being around in the
morning isn't my long suit.

392
00:29:50,368 --> 00:29:53,337
So, you got your questions...

393
00:29:53,371 --> 00:29:56,340
you got your ambient noise
at the rally.

394
00:29:57,375 --> 00:30:00,344
I don't imagine
it's your long suit either.

395
00:30:01,379 --> 00:30:03,347
Maybe not.

396
00:30:06,384 --> 00:30:09,353
So we keep it loose...

397
00:30:09,387 --> 00:30:11,355
and we keep it open.

398
00:30:11,389 --> 00:30:13,357
And if we get lucky...

399
00:30:17,395 --> 00:30:19,363
gold.

400
00:30:30,408 --> 00:30:32,376
Okay, here you go.

401
00:30:35,413 --> 00:30:38,382
You and Joanna have any children?

402
00:30:43,421 --> 00:30:45,389
- No. Iris and I had...
- Iris?

403
00:30:45,423 --> 00:30:49,382
My first wife. We had a little girl.

404
00:30:49,427 --> 00:30:52,396
She lived a week. Eight days.

405
00:30:57,435 --> 00:30:59,335
You have family?

406
00:31:00,372 --> 00:31:03,341
- My sister.
- You close?

407
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:07,334
I raised her,
after my mother died.

408
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:11,338
Our mom totaled the car
on Mount Rose Highway.

409
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:15,353
She always wanted to sing in a
lounge, but she never did.

410
00:31:15,387 --> 00:31:18,356
She had this whole Patti Page set.

411
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:21,359
She was okay.

412
00:31:25,397 --> 00:31:27,365
Look...

413
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,369
I've been here before.

414
00:31:31,403 --> 00:31:33,371
So have I.

415
00:31:49,421 --> 00:31:51,389
Newsroom.

416
00:31:52,424 --> 00:31:54,392
Just a minute.

417
00:31:54,426 --> 00:31:57,395
- For you.
- For me?

418
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:04,335
This is Tally.

419
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,349
I'll call you when I get home.

420
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:30,361
- I need to take a few days off.
- Something wrong?

421
00:32:30,395 --> 00:32:33,364
- No, nothing's wrong.
- But you have to take some days off.

422
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:36,367
It's personal, okay?

423
00:32:50,415 --> 00:32:53,384
Lt's okay.

424
00:32:57,422 --> 00:33:01,324
It's gonna be all right, Luanne.
I'll get the money. I'm here.

425
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:12,325
It's not about economic chaos
or political uncertainty.

426
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:16,329
- Today at six, The Channel Nine...
- About that Omega Seven story.

427
00:33:16,374 --> 00:33:19,343
The Omega Seven parole hearing?
Let Steve do it.

428
00:33:19,377 --> 00:33:22,346
And if Tally's back tomorrow,
she can do an action wrap-up.

429
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,349
I wouldn't count on that.

430
00:33:26,384 --> 00:33:30,343
You want me to get Accounting
to wire her the cash advance?

431
00:33:33,391 --> 00:33:35,359
No, I'll take care of it.

432
00:33:35,393 --> 00:33:39,352
Tell Dan I hear Arnie Poole"s
contract's up in San Francisco.

433
00:33:39,397 --> 00:33:42,366
And I just might get
him a new weatherman.

434
00:33:56,414 --> 00:33:58,382
One seventy-five.

435
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:01,317
It's not my problem if her boyfriend
skips out on her and steals her money.

436
00:34:01,353 --> 00:34:05,312
- I want the rent now.
- I'll get it to you tomorrow.

437
00:34:05,357 --> 00:34:08,326
I need it in full. I told her that,
or else I gotta get the marshal in.

438
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,319
- I'll get the rest of it tomorrow.
- Tomorrow's today. Pay up or out.

439
00:34:12,364 --> 00:34:14,332
How much?

440
00:34:16,368 --> 00:34:19,337
- What are you doing here?
- I'm on my way to San Francisco...

441
00:34:19,371 --> 00:34:22,340
to buy Dan some happy weather.
How much?

442
00:34:22,374 --> 00:34:24,342
She's five fifty short.

443
00:34:26,378 --> 00:34:29,347
The extra goes on account. Let's go.

444
00:34:30,382 --> 00:34:34,341
Did you interview you any
celebrities, Sallyanne?

445
00:34:34,386 --> 00:34:36,354
Come on.

446
00:34:41,393 --> 00:34:45,352
- You get a rush out of humiliating me!
- I didn't come here for a rush.

447
00:34:45,397 --> 00:34:48,366
- The what did you come here for?
- I had a hunch.

448
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,359
You had a hunch you'd walk in here and
get the story on me and my sister.

449
00:34:52,404 --> 00:34:55,373
I have no interest in your sister.
I just met her a few minutes ago.

450
00:34:55,407 --> 00:35:00,310
Why don't you get her in depth?
Washing her underwear in the sink?

451
00:35:00,345 --> 00:35:03,314
Look, you asked for cash,
I provided it. Over and out.

452
00:35:03,348 --> 00:35:08,308
You provided it?
What exactly do you take me for?

453
00:35:08,353 --> 00:35:11,322
- Wait a minute.
- You come here and spreads bills...

454
00:35:11,356 --> 00:35:16,316
around like you picked me up in some
bar, in front of that asshole!

455
00:35:16,361 --> 00:35:21,321
- You have no business here!
- Hold on. You work for me.

456
00:35:21,366 --> 00:35:25,325
You announce you're taking off, forget
about the part, if it's okay for me...

457
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,338
shoot off a fax demanding cash.

458
00:35:27,372 --> 00:35:30,341
And you figured you'd do me this
big favor and l'd owe you.

459
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:34,334
- Well, that was my mistake.
- Every girl I grew up with...

460
00:35:34,379 --> 00:35:40,340
- ended up thinking she owed some guy.
- This doesn't interest me.

461
00:35:42,387 --> 00:35:44,355
I was gonna get us out of here.

462
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:49,349
I told Luanne, "We'll get an apartment
on the Upper West Side"...

463
00:35:49,394 --> 00:35:52,363
because I read some magazine that said
Diane Sawyer lived there.

464
00:35:52,397 --> 00:35:56,356
I didn't know the upper side west side
of what. I just knew...

465
00:35:57,402 --> 00:35:59,302
I had to get us there.

466
00:35:59,337 --> 00:36:04,297
That's what happens. Some guy comes
along and no more Upper West Side.

467
00:36:05,343 --> 00:36:09,302
- Does that interest you?
- That interests me.

468
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:23,327
I need another couple of days...

469
00:36:24,362 --> 00:36:28,321
to make sure she's all right.

470
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:31,335
If that's okay with you.

471
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:35,339
It's perfectly okay with me.

472
00:36:41,379 --> 00:36:47,340
This is the final boarding call for
fight eight-oh, four to San Francisco.

473
00:36:47,385 --> 00:36:51,344
All remaining passengers
should board now.

474
00:36:56,394 --> 00:37:02,299
- So, take as long as you need.
- I didn't want you to see any of this.

475
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:04,301
So what?

476
00:37:26,357 --> 00:37:30,316
He completely ignored the fact that
this is a society divided by fear...

477
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:34,320
...hatred and violence.
- Not true.

478
00:37:34,365 --> 00:37:36,333
We haven't discussed...

479
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:41,327
"Promises and pie crust are made to
be broken, "Jonathan Swift once said.

480
00:37:41,372 --> 00:37:46,332
And the President's environmental
package resembles cherry pie crust.

481
00:37:46,377 --> 00:37:50,336
South Vietnamese planes struck
the wrong target here today.

482
00:37:50,381 --> 00:37:56,342
Their own village. Napalm burned
civilians running for their lives.

483
00:37:56,387 --> 00:38:00,289
Here's what we don't know, on this day
where over 200 US Marines were killed.

484
00:38:00,325 --> 00:38:03,294
With the death toll still rising.

485
00:38:03,328 --> 00:38:08,288
There was no perimeter defense set
up that might've stopped the bomber.

486
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:13,293
We don't know what roll these
Marines were supposed to play here...

487
00:38:13,338 --> 00:38:18,298
why they were even here. And so,
at the end of this terrible day...

488
00:38:18,343 --> 00:38:23,303
what we do know is that over 200
Marines died without knowing why.

489
00:38:23,348 --> 00:38:27,307
This is Warren Justice, I.B.S. News,
Beirut, Lebanon.

490
00:38:27,352 --> 00:38:33,313
Warren Justice stepped down today as
Chief White House Correspondent.

491
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:39,319
An award-winning journalist, Justice
has been a prominent figure at IBS...

492
00:38:39,364 --> 00:38:43,323
So, what's is it like
working at the network?

493
00:38:43,368 --> 00:38:47,327
You think you'll get to the network and
look back at everybody that made...

494
00:38:47,372 --> 00:38:50,341
you eat it and say, "Up yours."
But it's not like that.

495
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:53,344
- What is it like?
- It's hard.

496
00:38:54,379 --> 00:38:56,347
It's fun.

497
00:38:56,381 --> 00:39:01,284
- Then why did you leave?
- It stopped being fun.

498
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:06,279
Tell me about these dumb contests
you used to enter with Tawney Buchner.

499
00:39:07,325 --> 00:39:10,294
- Why don't you tell me why...
- How about the contests?

500
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:15,299
The contests.

501
00:39:17,335 --> 00:39:23,296
Miss Stateline, Miss Truckee,
Miss Tahoe, Miss Sierra Logger.

502
00:39:23,341 --> 00:39:27,300
- I'll tell you a secret.
- L'd keep Sierra Logger a secret.

503
00:39:27,345 --> 00:39:31,304
No. The secret is, in not one of
them did I finish in the top five.

504
00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:36,309
So, what's you do for talent? Did
you by chance sing, "Feelings"?

505
00:39:36,354 --> 00:39:40,313
No. For your information, I did not
by any chance sing "Feelings."

506
00:39:45,363 --> 00:39:51,324
To dream the impossible dream

507
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:56,329
To fight the unbeatable foe

508
00:39:56,374 --> 00:40:03,337
To bear the unbearable sorrow

509
00:40:03,381 --> 00:40:08,341
To run where the brave dare not go

510
00:40:09,387 --> 00:40:14,347
To right the unrightable wrong

511
00:40:14,392 --> 00:40:20,353
To love pure and chaste from afar

512
00:40:20,398 --> 00:40:27,361
To try when your arms are to weary

513
00:40:27,405 --> 00:40:29,373
To reach

514
00:40:29,407 --> 00:40:34,367
The unreachable star

515
00:40:34,412 --> 00:40:40,373
This is my quest
To follow that star

516
00:40:40,418 --> 00:40:44,377
- Phone sex is on the rise.
- Yeah? Warren won't touch that.

517
00:40:44,422 --> 00:40:47,391
- Alaskan wolves.
- As in the slaughter of?

518
00:40:47,425 --> 00:40:51,384
We have tape of a wolf
caught in a trap.

519
00:40:51,429 --> 00:40:53,397
You got tape on that?
Run it at six.

520
00:40:53,431 --> 00:40:57,390
Metro-Dade reports tourist robbery
complaints are up eight percent.

521
00:40:57,435 --> 00:40:59,335
It's a story this town's
talking about.

522
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:03,329
Correction. It's not a story
his town wants to talk about.

523
00:41:03,374 --> 00:41:07,333
I don't think Tally's her pulse on the
finger of the community the way I do.

524
00:41:07,378 --> 00:41:10,347
I think you mean finger on the
pulse of the community, Rob.

525
00:41:10,381 --> 00:41:14,340
Anyway let's get people talking about
it. Harvey, you get into that.

526
00:41:14,385 --> 00:41:18,344
It's your first step towards the Pea-
body Award. Somebody makes me happy.

527
00:41:18,389 --> 00:41:22,348
Wait! Here's a cross-dresser
from Tallahassee who gets all the...

528
00:41:22,393 --> 00:41:25,362
to the finals in Miss Florida contest.

529
00:41:25,396 --> 00:41:29,355
- Boring.
- Tally, maybe you wanna handle that.

530
00:41:31,402 --> 00:41:35,361
- You'd do a real in depth piece on it.
- I think I'll pass.

531
00:41:35,406 --> 00:41:41,367
Think, "Cross-dresser from Tallahassee
who dreams the impossible dream.

532
00:41:41,412 --> 00:41:44,381
You cannot be trusted.

533
00:41:44,415 --> 00:41:46,383
Okay, anything else?

534
00:41:53,424 --> 00:41:56,393
- So, this is where I live.
- It's...

535
00:41:56,427 --> 00:41:59,328
- What?
- 502, vehicle registered to...

536
00:41:59,363 --> 00:42:02,332
Skylight Limo.

537
00:42:04,368 --> 00:42:08,327
- You keep this on all the time?
- I find it soothing.

538
00:42:08,372 --> 00:42:11,341
The sound of human iniquity.

539
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:14,344
You know what a five-oh-two is?

540
00:42:14,378 --> 00:42:18,337
D.W.I., driving while intoxicated.

541
00:42:18,382 --> 00:42:22,341
Skylight Limo's the one the rockers
use. Probably a drug bust.

542
00:42:22,386 --> 00:42:25,355
Controlled substances.

543
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:29,359
Tally Atwater reporting live.

544
00:42:32,396 --> 00:42:34,364
You better get goin'.

545
00:42:38,402 --> 00:42:42,361
The night we did the Diaz story,
in the editing room...

546
00:42:42,406 --> 00:42:44,374
I didn't knew you then.

547
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:51,370
I'm not gonna be the guy that goes,
"No more Upper West Side." So?

548
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:59,322
First on the scene? One-on-one with the
lead guitar? Isn't that what you want?

549
00:42:59,357 --> 00:43:01,325
What do you want?

550
00:43:19,377 --> 00:43:22,346
I knew you'd go.

551
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:26,339
This is Tally Atwater saying Happy
New Year form W.M.I.A. Channel Nine...

552
00:43:26,384 --> 00:43:29,353
News Heartbeat of
the American Riviera.

553
00:43:29,387 --> 00:43:33,346
You give us thirty minutes,
and we give you Miami. Yel mundo.

554
00:43:33,391 --> 00:43:38,351
- We're back in Times Square...
- Have you ever met Bucky Terranova?

555
00:43:39,397 --> 00:43:42,366
Agents are for babes,
Tal, not for grunts.

556
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,359
He's coming Miami next week
for a panel.

557
00:43:47,405 --> 00:43:50,374
So is Joanna Kennelly.

558
00:43:51,409 --> 00:43:54,378
Tally, you and Warren...

559
00:43:54,412 --> 00:43:58,371
you guys aren't having a...
you know... thing, are you?

560
00:44:01,352 --> 00:44:03,320
That's what I thought.

561
00:44:04,355 --> 00:44:07,324
The usual deal is
somebody ends up crying.

562
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:11,328
Nobody is going to end up crying.

563
00:44:11,362 --> 00:44:15,321
And it's usually not Warren.

564
00:44:15,366 --> 00:44:18,335
Happy New Year to all of you!

565
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:28,334
Okay, you got the baby?
Oye... you got me, okay?

566
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:32,349
Fernando, you were convicted in
July of armed robbery...

567
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:37,343
- your third felony conviction.
- No... fourth.

568
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:44,350
So you get free baby clothes, toys,
diaper service for a year, all for...

569
00:44:44,395 --> 00:44:49,355
- what are you calling the baby?
- Fernandito. My name.

570
00:44:54,405 --> 00:44:59,308
And so, Fernando Buttanda heads
north for Holmesburg Prison...

571
00:44:59,343 --> 00:45:02,312
leaving behind wife, Augustina,
and their five children in Cuba.

572
00:45:02,346 --> 00:45:05,315
- Here's something from the booth.
- And Rosario Mota...

573
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:10,309
who at twelve oh two this morning,
gave birth to Fernando, Junior...

574
00:45:10,354 --> 00:45:13,323
Miami's first baby of the new year.

575
00:45:13,357 --> 00:45:15,325
- Sad story, Tally.
- It is, Rob.

576
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:20,319
One with a New Year's twist. I was
just informed that the local...

577
00:45:20,364 --> 00:45:25,324
merchants association decided that
because of the unusual circumstances...

578
00:45:25,369 --> 00:45:29,328
the first-born layette should be
awarded instead to Tiffany Policek.

579
00:45:31,375 --> 00:45:33,343
Very nice.

580
00:45:33,377 --> 00:45:37,336
- You might've cleared this with me.
- Back to the two-shot.

581
00:45:38,382 --> 00:45:42,341
Tiffany was the second. The layette
was supposed to go to the first-born.

582
00:45:42,386 --> 00:45:46,345
Well, I think I see the
merchant's point, Tally.

583
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:50,349
- I'm not surprised you do, Rob.
- Happy New Year. Go to commercial.

584
00:45:50,394 --> 00:45:52,362
No go. It's thirty seconds
till the credits.

585
00:45:52,396 --> 00:45:57,356
Buttanda is an habitual offender. The
woman has 2 children out of wedlock.

586
00:45:57,401 --> 00:46:01,303
- After all, what?
- Guys, cut it out.

587
00:46:01,338 --> 00:46:04,307
- I don't think we need to go into that.
- You got two cameras on 'em.

588
00:46:04,341 --> 00:46:06,309
- Get one on something else.
- What else is there?

589
00:46:06,343 --> 00:46:08,311
Lt's a runaway train.

590
00:46:10,347 --> 00:46:14,306
In the spirit of the new year and
the whole idea of first-born...

591
00:46:14,351 --> 00:46:16,319
I'm sure W.M.I.A. Would
be delighted to...

592
00:46:16,353 --> 00:46:20,312
honor Miami's true first-born,
Fernandito Buttanda.

593
00:46:20,357 --> 00:46:23,326
- She can't do that.
- She just did.

594
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:28,320
- Fifteen seconds to credits.
- That's all. I'm Rob Sullivan.

595
00:46:28,365 --> 00:46:32,324
Tally will surelyjoin me in
saying, "Be of good cheer.

596
00:46:32,369 --> 00:46:36,328
And Happy New Year from all of us
on the Channel Nine News Team."

597
00:46:36,373 --> 00:46:38,341
Go. Matte it.

598
00:46:40,377 --> 00:46:43,346
We gotta hold this for fifteen.
Fill in mikes.

599
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:47,339
- This the last time you sit here.
- I didn't know you'd been appointed...

600
00:46:47,384 --> 00:46:51,343
- Commissar of Public Morality.
- He's a criminal and she's a whore.

601
00:46:51,388 --> 00:46:54,357
Well, only whores have
babies out of wedlock?

602
00:46:54,391 --> 00:46:59,294
- Warren, your protegee is out of line.
- Protegee? Does that mean whore, too?

603
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:03,289
Tally, shut up and smile. Rob,
we're still on air. Keep smiling.

604
00:47:03,334 --> 00:47:06,303
- Warren, we've gotta talk.
- She doesn't have the maturity.

605
00:47:06,337 --> 00:47:11,297
- You're pushing her too fast.
- Your protegee doesn't have maturity.

606
00:47:11,342 --> 00:47:17,303
If you think that pompadour gives you
maturity, you need professional help.

607
00:47:17,348 --> 00:47:21,307
That's enough, Tally. Rob, handling the
unexpected is what we call television.

608
00:47:21,352 --> 00:47:24,321
- She has no right...
- To what? Tell the truth?

609
00:47:24,355 --> 00:47:27,324
Or change copy to something safe?

610
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:30,327
She's off reservation.
And it's up to you to go...

611
00:47:30,361 --> 00:47:35,321
To what? Rope her in? Cut her down to
size? What size do you want? Your size?

612
00:47:35,366 --> 00:47:38,335
Warren, I'm warning you.

613
00:47:38,369 --> 00:47:42,328
- That's a wrap. Thank you.
- This is unbelievable!

614
00:47:42,373 --> 00:47:47,333
Childish and amateurish behavior. They
would've fired her in Saint Louis.

615
00:47:47,378 --> 00:47:50,347
- Right, Rob, though shop, Saint Louis.
- I'm taking this to Dan!

616
00:47:50,381 --> 00:47:52,349
If you don't, I will.

617
00:47:52,383 --> 00:47:56,342
Listen, next time you want to
embarrass the station, quit first.

618
00:47:56,387 --> 00:47:58,355
- You want me to quit?
- Yeah, that's what I want.

619
00:47:58,389 --> 00:48:02,291
You don't go around changing
station policy on air!

620
00:48:02,326 --> 00:48:05,295
- I'm the one who has to...
- This is a team!

621
00:48:05,329 --> 00:48:07,297
But I'm not part of the team, am I?

622
00:48:07,331 --> 00:48:12,291
I'll always be written off as the
News Director's protegee.

623
00:48:12,336 --> 00:48:17,296
So, fine! I'm capable of finding a job
where I am nobody's protegee.

624
00:48:20,344 --> 00:48:22,312
Feliz año nuevo.

625
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,328
You're right.

626
00:48:38,362 --> 00:48:42,321
My sister has a baby. Her live-in
has a record. That make her a whore?

627
00:48:42,366 --> 00:48:45,335
- Right again.
- He's just stupid.

628
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:47,337
He's an anchor.

629
00:49:04,321 --> 00:49:08,280
- Mister Terranova, one photo, please.
- Joanna Kennelly?

630
00:49:09,326 --> 00:49:12,295
- Mister Terranova?
- Tally?

631
00:49:12,329 --> 00:49:16,288
Joanna Kennelly. We've met before. Hi.

632
00:49:17,334 --> 00:49:22,294
- Have you know Bucky for long?
- No, I don't actually know him.

633
00:49:22,339 --> 00:49:25,308
But you want to. Bucky, come here.

634
00:49:28,345 --> 00:49:32,304
Tally Atwater, Mister Bucky Terranova.

637
00:49:38,355 --> 00:49:41,324
I was wondering when
you'd walk into my life.

638
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:43,326
Oh, please.

639
00:49:44,361 --> 00:49:48,320
I'm gonna need a suite at the Wilshire
and a floor pass at the Forum.

640

Just tell'em it's for the day that the

00:49:55,372 --> 00:49:59,331

- Suns. No, I'll call you back.

00:50:11,388 --> 00:50:15,347
But it's not this year's ass, is it?
Not even last year's.

646
00:50:15,392 --> 00:50:20,352
I am seven years and three
dozen asses back.

647
00:50:20,397 --> 00:50:23,366
The next time I see you...

648
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,369
it'll be four dozen.

649
00:50:26,403 --> 00:50:30,362
Unless you're gonna tell me
this one's different.

650
00:50:31,408 --> 00:50:33,376
Wait a minute.

651
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:38,370
- Has somebody finally got to you?
- This is not what you think.

652
00:50:38,415 --> 00:50:41,384
Just good friends.
That is novel.

653
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,388
What's it feel like?

654
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:55,398
It feels good.

655
00:51:01,372 --> 00:51:06,332
You gonna go with her when
she makes her move?

656
00:51:13,384 --> 00:51:18,344
You need a year or two in a major
market. Preferably at an O and O.

657
00:51:18,389 --> 00:51:21,358
What's your feeling
about Philadelphia?

658
00:51:24,395 --> 00:51:27,364
A large city in Pennsylvania.
I can put you there.

659
00:51:27,398 --> 00:51:29,366
- It's a number four market.
- It's do-able.

660
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,359
They're looking for a fresh face.
Lucky timing.

661
00:51:33,404 --> 00:51:39,365
Your vice is full of money.
Anybody ever tell you that?

662
00:52:03,367 --> 00:52:07,326
- I was having...
- I know. I know where you're going.

663
00:52:07,371 --> 00:52:11,330
I bet he said your voice
was full of money.

664
00:52:12,376 --> 00:52:14,344
That's what he always says.

665
00:52:15,379 --> 00:52:18,348
He's famous for it.
He even said that to Joanna.

666
00:52:18,382 --> 00:52:21,351
It's actually not even his line.
It's from a novel.

667
00:52:23,387 --> 00:52:27,346
"Her voice was full of money. That
was the inexhaustible charm...

668
00:52:27,391 --> 00:52:30,360
that rose and fell in it."

669
00:52:31,395 --> 00:52:34,364
Hemingway, right?

670
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,369
F. Scott Fitzgerald.

671
00:52:44,408 --> 00:52:46,376
Cheap shot.

672
00:52:47,411 --> 00:52:49,379
It's the right move.

673
00:52:50,414 --> 00:52:53,383
Nobody ever called Bucky dumb.

674
00:52:54,418 --> 00:52:57,387
I guess it's even the right time.

675
00:53:02,359 --> 00:53:05,328
We had some fun, you and I.
didn't we?

676
00:53:14,371 --> 00:53:16,339
What is it you want?

677
00:53:24,381 --> 00:53:28,340
- You know what I want.
- You wanna go to Philadelphia.

678
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:42,358
So, he says to me...

679
00:54:42,392 --> 00:54:46,351
"If you need a mentor...
Roberino."

680
00:54:47,397 --> 00:54:49,365
Roberino?

681
00:54:52,402 --> 00:54:56,361
Will do me a favor?
don't ever say that again.

682
00:55:14,358 --> 00:55:16,326
You could come with me.

683
00:55:18,362 --> 00:55:23,322
First prize: A week in Philadelphia.
Second prize: Two weeks.

684
00:55:24,368 --> 00:55:26,336
It's an old joke.

685
00:55:27,371 --> 00:55:30,340
- L've already been where you're going.
- You could go back.

686
00:55:34,378 --> 00:55:36,346
- Why not?
- I already told you.

687
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:39,349
All you told me is that
it stopped being fun.

688
00:55:39,383 --> 00:55:42,352
It was a good run while it lasted.

689
00:55:43,387 --> 00:55:46,356
Then I made a mistake.

690
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:49,359
What kind of mistake?

691
00:55:50,394 --> 00:55:55,354
I had and trusted a source. I went
with the story and I got burned.

692
00:55:55,399 --> 00:56:00,302
The source did what sources do.
I missed the signals.

693
00:56:00,337 --> 00:56:04,296
You're allowed to make a
mistake once in a while.

694
00:56:04,341 --> 00:56:07,310
Not really.

695
00:56:07,344 --> 00:56:12,304
If you chose not to play on the
team... you can't afford mistakes.

696
00:56:16,353 --> 00:56:20,312
Why didn't we do this before?

697
00:56:22,359 --> 00:56:26,318
Because it was always gonna be
this hard to stop.

698
00:56:27,364 --> 00:56:31,323
You know, we have some time
before you go.

699
00:56:32,369 --> 00:56:34,337
I don't wanna go.

700
00:56:36,373 --> 00:56:38,341
Sure you do.

701
00:58:19,342 --> 00:58:22,311
You know something?
I never got a...

702
00:58:22,345 --> 00:58:25,314
What've you got here? For me?

703
00:58:29,352 --> 00:58:32,321
Miss Sierra Logger. Okay.

704
00:58:39,362 --> 00:58:41,330
You better go.

705
00:58:44,367 --> 00:58:46,335
Go.

706
00:59:28,345 --> 00:59:33,305
Up next, shocking new information
about a nursing home sex scandal.

707
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:35,318
Stay with us.
We'll back in a moment.

708
00:59:35,352 --> 00:59:40,312
John, whoever wrote that copy about
the nursing home should be fired.

709
00:59:40,357 --> 00:59:43,326
It's silly, it's wrong,
and I won't say it.

710
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:48,320
Then wing it. You're up to speed on
this story. A real warhorse, Marcia.

711
00:59:48,365 --> 00:59:52,324
We'd get together for a drink so you
two kids could get to know each other.

712
00:59:52,369 --> 00:59:53,336
Sure.

713
00:59:57,374 --> 01:00:02,334
Would you mind having your guest move?
She's in my eyeline.

714
01:00:02,379 --> 01:00:05,348
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, here we go again.

715
01:00:06,383 --> 01:00:09,352
John, have you any idea
how little coverage...

716
01:00:09,386 --> 01:00:13,345
we actually devote to substantive
discussion of public policy?

717
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:17,349
You an issues wonk, too, Tally?

718
01:00:18,395 --> 01:00:22,354
- I agree it's an important point.
- What is?

719
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:25,368
The need for substanit...
Bucky told me.

720
01:00:25,402 --> 01:00:29,361
- Bucky? Bucky who?
- Bucky Terranova, my agent...

721
01:00:29,406 --> 01:00:32,375
said that Tom Orr told him...

722
01:00:32,409 --> 01:00:36,368
- Tom? You know Tom?
- Well, not exactly. But...

723
01:00:36,413 --> 01:00:39,382
Tom isjust about
the worst offender.

724
01:00:39,416 --> 01:00:43,375
Well, I have two charity
auctions to attend tonight.

725
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:46,389
Is that actually a
banana daiquiri?

726
01:00:46,423 --> 01:00:49,392
Spring break, Lauderdale.
Good night, Tally.

727
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:56,399
- Ready, B.T. One.
- Time again for '90 Years Young.

728
01:00:56,433 --> 01:00:58,401
Today we're blessed with twins.

729
01:00:58,435 --> 01:01:02,337
Roxy and Ruby Temple down in
South Kendall at the Clearview Home.

730
01:01:03,373 --> 01:01:07,332
- It's a cute segment.
- What's cute about it, Dan?

731
01:01:07,377 --> 01:01:11,336
...long life to the active things
they did in their younger days.

732
01:01:11,381 --> 01:01:15,340
Is it cute to be nice to people just
because they are older than you?

733
01:01:15,385 --> 01:01:19,344
Will it be cute when you're 98,
fighting to hang on to your dignity...

734
01:01:19,389 --> 01:01:22,358
and there's Rob Sullivan out of the
blue with some cheap birthday cake...

735
01:01:22,392 --> 01:01:27,352
- calling you a beautiful youngster?
- I don't wanna argue about this.

736
01:01:27,397 --> 01:01:30,366
There are people fighting out
there for this spot!

737
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,359
And any time I have a spot that
advertisers are willing to fight for...

738
01:01:34,404 --> 01:01:36,372
then this is a good spot.

739
01:01:36,406 --> 01:01:41,366
Is that how we're programming news?
Asking the advertisers what they want?

740
01:01:41,411 --> 01:01:46,371
Say an advertiser wants a laugh-track.
What about that, Dan? ¿No problema?

741
01:01:46,416 --> 01:01:49,385
- Like it or not, this is a business.
- Yeah, it's a business.

742
01:01:49,419 --> 01:01:54,379
The entertainment business. The hell
with the news and with the truth.

743
01:01:55,425 --> 01:02:01,330
- Where have all the good times gone?
- Philadelphia.

744
01:02:02,365 --> 01:02:06,324
Off this ambulance drivers' strike,
we'd get into the crisis in emergency...

745
01:02:06,369 --> 01:02:10,328
Emergency rooms are so crowded,
hospitals are turning ambulances away.

746
01:02:10,373 --> 01:02:13,342
They don't have the beds.

747
01:02:13,376 --> 01:02:17,335
- What hospitals, Tally?
- County General, for one.

748
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:20,349
Queen of Angels? Saint Matthews?

749
01:02:20,383 --> 01:02:24,342
How many hospitals?
You said hospitals, plural.

750
01:02:24,387 --> 01:02:29,347
Which hospitals? When? How many
people turned away? Why?

751
01:02:29,392 --> 01:02:34,352
I have a call in to the
Paramedics Association.

752
01:02:35,398 --> 01:02:40,358
When you have the statistics, you
should reintroduce. Shall we move on?

753
01:02:40,403 --> 01:02:43,372
If you could find him, Lleana,
I only have a minute.

754
01:02:46,409 --> 01:02:50,368
I saw on the weather channel it's
ninety-five there.

755
01:02:50,413 --> 01:02:55,373
Actually I just didn't wanna forget
what your voice sounded like.

756
01:02:55,418 --> 01:02:58,387
No, I haven't forgotten
what you look like.

757
01:02:59,355 --> 01:03:02,324
Stop right there. We have to feed.

758
01:03:02,358 --> 01:03:04,326
I miss you too.

759
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:08,319
Rape has become an ugly
fact of life in Philadelphia.

760
01:03:08,364 --> 01:03:14,325
And in just a moment, we'll be
hearing Tally Atwater on that subject.

761
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:17,339
Some statistics may convey
the idea, Marcia.

762
01:03:17,373 --> 01:03:21,332
According to recent studies, the
median age of men who commit rape...

763
01:03:21,377 --> 01:03:23,345
in Philadelphia, is twenty-three.

764
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:26,348
Half have a prior arrest record.

765
01:03:26,382 --> 01:03:31,342
Nine percent of these had been
previously arrested for rape.

766
01:03:31,387 --> 01:03:34,356
Sobering. But don't you think,
Tally, that statistics can seem...

767
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:38,349
in the face of real human outrage,
worse than irrelevant?

768
01:03:39,395 --> 01:03:42,364
Right, Marcia.

769
01:03:43,399 --> 01:03:46,368
Coming up next, Bernie Plant,
with the weather.

770
01:03:49,405 --> 01:03:51,373
You want some coffee or something?

771
01:03:51,407 --> 01:03:54,376
Well, I thought I owed you a talk.

772
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:58,369
We've got these marketing consultants.
They run focus groups. They invite...

773
01:03:58,414 --> 01:04:02,316
20 citizens in for cold cuts,
see what they like and don't like.

774
01:04:02,352 --> 01:04:09,315
I thought it might be constructive to
know what they had to say about Tally.

775
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:12,328
Very helpful, John.

776
01:04:12,362 --> 01:04:16,321
I don't like her. I hit the
refrigerator when she comes on.

777
01:04:16,366 --> 01:04:19,335
- She looks like...
...a bush league Marcia.

778
01:04:19,369 --> 01:04:21,337
If you ask me, it's her hair.

779
01:04:21,371 --> 01:04:25,330
Why is it women always
go with the hair?

780
01:04:25,375 --> 01:04:29,334
- Hair is character.
- Nobody from nowhere.

781
01:04:29,379 --> 01:04:32,348
Well, that's enough of that.

782
01:04:32,382 --> 01:04:34,350
Tally, I hired you.

783
01:04:34,384 --> 01:04:40,345
You have real potential. But there's
a feeling that you're not making...

784
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:43,359
- Contact.
- Right.

785
01:04:44,394 --> 01:04:47,363
I wanna leave this on a positive note.

786
01:04:47,397 --> 01:04:51,356
What you ought to do is talk to the
consultants who run these deals.

787
01:04:51,401 --> 01:04:54,370
And just see what
they have to say. Okay?

788
01:04:57,407 --> 01:05:00,308
Is something up?
Anything wrong?

789
01:05:00,343 --> 01:05:03,312
No reason at all. I just...

790
01:05:03,346 --> 01:05:08,306
Why should anything wrong? I'm
so busy. And I just hit a break.

791
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:12,310
You busy? You hit a brake?

792
01:05:12,355 --> 01:05:16,314
- Well, I saw these consultants.
- Consultants on what?

793
01:05:16,359 --> 01:05:21,319
- I had a makeover.
- A makeover? What do you mean a...

794
01:05:21,364 --> 01:05:26,324
It seems that I was a little
too edgy for Philly.

795
01:05:26,369 --> 01:05:29,338
Marcia couldn't be nicer.

796
01:05:29,372 --> 01:05:35,333
- She's a super girl.
- Super? Marcia McGrath?

797
01:05:39,382 --> 01:05:42,351
Tal... you okay?
Anything I can do?

798
01:05:42,385 --> 01:05:45,354
No, everything's great.
It's just that I...

799
01:05:48,391 --> 01:05:50,359
It's just that I...

800
01:05:52,395 --> 01:05:54,363
I...

801
01:05:55,398 --> 01:05:57,366
wanted to say hi.

802
01:06:01,337 --> 01:06:04,306
You wanna say hi again, I'm here.

803
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:36,338
¿Habla inglese?

804
01:06:39,375 --> 01:06:43,334
- Bucky Terranova.
- So, Warren, how long has it been?

805
01:06:43,379 --> 01:06:47,338
R.F.K. Stadium, owner's box,
Redskins-Giants.

806
01:06:49,385 --> 01:06:54,345
I wanted to leave Washington. You said:
I didn't handle people on the way down.

807
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:57,359
So, what brings you to Miami?

808
01:06:57,393 --> 01:07:00,294
- Stone crab?
- Try again.

809
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:05,290
The fact is, Warren, I have a client
in a certain amount of distress.

810
01:07:05,335 --> 01:07:10,295
A client with whom you have
a special relationship.

811
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:14,299
And it occurred to me, you might want
to be up there for a period of time.

812
01:07:14,344 --> 01:07:20,305
- Last I heard, I still had a job here.
- I see that it keeps you very busy.

813
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:25,310
What if I can arrange a leave? Wait a
minute. I'm seeing daylight on this.

814
01:07:25,355 --> 01:07:27,323
I bring Mel Casey from
Atlanta to sub for you.

815
01:07:27,357 --> 01:07:31,316
He's got a young wife, only wants
the spotjobs. But it's his life.

816
01:07:31,361 --> 01:07:34,330
You've already laid this on Dan,
haven't you?

817
01:07:34,364 --> 01:07:37,333
You two could use a timeout.

818
01:07:38,368 --> 01:07:43,328
This isn't about you and me.
She's in trouble. Think it over.

819
01:07:59,322 --> 01:08:01,290
What's up?

820
01:08:08,331 --> 01:08:11,300
I wasjust wishing I was driving
down the Keys with you...

821
01:08:11,334 --> 01:08:14,303
and we were already picking up
Havana on the radio.

822
01:08:20,343 --> 01:08:24,302
- How long can you stay?
- Long enough.

823
01:08:38,361 --> 01:08:40,329
Oh, hey, what the...

824
01:08:44,367 --> 01:08:48,326
- John, long time, no see.
- Warren?

825
01:08:49,372 --> 01:08:53,331
John and I covered the D.E.A.
Together in New Orleans.

826
01:08:54,377 --> 01:08:59,280
I just left my appointment book
here. And I'm on my way.

827
01:08:59,315 --> 01:09:03,274
- I didn't think you were coming back.
- I think he figured out, Tal.

828
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,288
Tally, Warren.

829
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:20,291
Fabian, here you are, back home in the
town where you were discovered...

830
01:09:20,336 --> 01:09:24,295
Everybody loved that piece.
We got a huge response.

831
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:27,309
I mean, considering...

832
01:09:27,343 --> 01:09:31,302
How about that guy who chose to
murder that woman?

833
01:09:31,347 --> 01:09:35,306
That was a terrific idea.
It just wasn't...

834
01:09:36,352 --> 01:09:38,320
It wasn't quite executed...

835
01:09:38,354 --> 01:09:42,313
You and your children have been
here for seven weeks now.

836
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:46,328
I was...

837
01:09:46,362 --> 01:09:50,321
I was really off that day. But there
is some good stuff with her children.

838
01:09:51,367 --> 01:09:56,327
- I... I...
- The S.R. O Housing Corporation...

839
01:09:56,372 --> 01:10:00,331
of course being the
city agency responsible...

840
01:10:00,376 --> 01:10:03,345
- You didn't get to the children.
- I don't need to.

841
01:10:03,379 --> 01:10:06,348
- No, but it's good.
- It's shit.

842
01:10:08,384 --> 01:10:11,353
- It was what?
- It was all shit.

843
01:10:12,388 --> 01:10:18,349
Why she was in the hospital?
Why couldn't she get her kids back?

844
01:10:18,394 --> 01:10:20,362
Did you listen to one word
that woman was saying?

845
01:10:20,396 --> 01:10:25,356
Or were you too busy worrying
about impressing the viewers?

846
01:10:27,403 --> 01:10:31,362
Who the hell is this?
What the hell happened to you?

847
01:10:31,407 --> 01:10:35,366
- Where's Tally Atwater?
- You tell me. You invented her!

848
01:10:35,411 --> 01:10:38,380
Well, I did one lousyjob!

849
01:10:38,414 --> 01:10:44,375
You come, take one look at Marcia and
you fold. If I was into inventing...

850
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:49,380
- l'd have invented somebody tougher.
I'm exactly the way you made me.

851
01:10:49,425 --> 01:10:53,384
Do it this way! Do it that way! I don't
even know how to do it without you.

852
01:10:53,429 --> 01:10:57,388
Bullshit. I dressed you, I pointed you
toward the camera, but you did it.

853
01:10:57,433 --> 01:11:00,334
You told the story. You know how to do
it. You're gonna doing it on your own.

854
01:11:00,369 --> 01:11:02,337
- I can't.
- Look at this.

855
01:11:02,371 --> 01:11:04,339
- The network...
- don't even talk...

856
01:11:04,373 --> 01:11:07,342
...twenty million people are gonna
be depending on you.

857
01:11:07,376 --> 01:11:10,345
- I don't care.
- Before they trust you they've to...

858
01:11:10,379 --> 01:11:15,339
know you're listening to them! To do
that, you must Know who you are!

859
01:11:16,385 --> 01:11:17,352
You see?

860
01:11:17,386 --> 01:11:22,346
Lt's not all Marcia McGrath country up
here. So, give them Tally Atwater.

861
01:11:26,395 --> 01:11:31,355
When I asked you how long you could
stay and you said, "Long enough"...

862
01:11:33,402 --> 01:11:36,371
how long is that?

863
01:11:36,405 --> 01:11:41,365
- When we're not together...
...everything shuts down.

864
01:11:44,413 --> 01:11:49,373
As Councilman, you were influential
in securing the permits and waivers...

865
01:11:49,418 --> 01:11:52,387
that allowed Patriot Hill
to begin construction.

866
01:11:52,421 --> 01:11:56,380
Yes, I cut through some of the
red tape for the developers.

867
01:11:56,425 --> 01:11:59,326
When Patriot Hill was still
called Dog Bottom...

868
01:11:59,362 --> 01:12:04,322
these same developers bought up the
neighborhood for dog bottom prices.

869
01:12:04,367 --> 01:12:09,327
- They also are in business.
- Big business, from what I understand.

870
01:12:09,372 --> 01:12:13,331
Evacuations continue at the Holly
Ball, the scene of a suspicious fire.

871
01:12:13,376 --> 01:12:17,335
- Tally, what's the latest?
- Whether the chandelier went down...

872
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:21,339
before or after nine-one-one got
called nobody is saying.

873
01:12:21,384 --> 01:12:24,353
But this has to ve one of the
most incendiary affairs of...

874
01:12:24,387 --> 01:12:29,347
what social register types here
call "The Season."

875
01:12:29,392 --> 01:12:33,351
The Holly Ball is one of our prettiest
and most traditional events.

876
01:12:33,396 --> 01:12:36,365
How do you suppose such
a thing happened?

877
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:39,368
A kid with too much time and
nothing to do with it.

878
01:12:39,402 --> 01:12:42,371
Bored silly. And dressed to kill.

879
01:12:42,405 --> 01:12:46,364
- Is that your opinion, Tally?
- No, that is observable fact.

880
01:12:46,409 --> 01:12:49,378
- Thank you, Tally.
- Bucky.

881
01:12:50,413 --> 01:12:53,382
Right, she is looking good.

882
01:12:53,416 --> 01:12:57,375
L'd like to sit down with you
sometime this week.

883
01:12:59,355 --> 01:13:02,324
So, the ratings are up.
The research says it's Tally.

884
01:13:02,358 --> 01:13:06,317
I owe you one. I hadn't factored
she was gonna need her hand held.

885
01:13:06,362 --> 01:13:09,331
You make your living off of
people that need their hands held.

886
01:13:11,367 --> 01:13:15,326
- She can go all the way, can't she?
- Assuming she doesn't go wiggy again?

887
01:13:15,371 --> 01:13:19,330
Does a first-rate job, makes a few
breaks for herself. I.B.S. Is the shot.

888
01:13:19,375 --> 01:13:22,344
Unless Wendy Chan shows more
than she's been showin'.

889
01:13:22,378 --> 01:13:26,337
- How long?
- A year, two years, eighteen months.

890
01:13:27,383 --> 01:13:31,342
Timeout to decode.
You up for the duration?

891
01:13:32,388 --> 01:13:35,357
No comment, read yeas.
Miami know this?

892
01:13:36,392 --> 01:13:38,360
Dan and I don't put each other
on speed dial.

893
01:13:38,394 --> 01:13:43,354
If Dan hears you're even thinking,
you've seen your last moon over Miami.

894
01:13:43,399 --> 01:13:47,358
From the point of view of the guys,
you don't exactly read user-friendly.

895
01:13:47,403 --> 01:13:53,364
- You left too much scorched earth.
- What is this, Bucky? Tough love?

896
01:13:53,409 --> 01:13:55,377
Try Pete Raymond.

897
01:13:57,413 --> 01:13:59,313
The last time I saw Pete Raymond...

898
01:13:59,348 --> 01:14:03,307
I told l'd be interested in watching
him cover his own retirement.

899
01:14:03,352 --> 01:14:06,321
That's funny. But you see the problem.

900
01:14:06,355 --> 01:14:11,315
I got it. I didn't mention to Tally
I was seeing you today.

901
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:14,329
Still doing it your way, I see.

902
01:14:14,363 --> 01:14:18,322
Tell Merino if he wants to keep her
happy, there's a cameraman in Miami.

903
01:14:18,367 --> 01:14:20,335
He's a good man.

904
01:14:34,383 --> 01:14:38,342
- What are you doing here?
- Old Warren pulled a few strings.

905
01:14:40,389 --> 01:14:43,358
- Really?
- That's right.

906
01:14:43,392 --> 01:14:46,361
Hell of a temptation, Warren,
having you back on the market.

907
01:14:46,395 --> 01:14:51,355
Never though you'd leave Miami. But,
end of the day, you're a hard news guy.

908
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:56,360
- We did a five-parter on nannies.
- Five-parter on nannies.

909
01:14:56,405 --> 01:14:59,306
- Right off the charts, response-wise.
- That right?

910
01:15:00,342 --> 01:15:04,301
Okay, you don't do nannies.
You don't take prisoners.

911
01:15:04,346 --> 01:15:09,306
You ought to pitch somebody
you don't have a history with.

912
01:15:09,351 --> 01:15:14,311
There's a hot young kid at Four in
Baltimore. Cord Otavio.

913
01:15:15,357 --> 01:15:21,318
Hold all my calls. So, tell me
something about yourself...

914
01:15:22,364 --> 01:15:24,332
Warren.

915
01:15:27,369 --> 01:15:30,338
You first, Cord.

916
01:15:36,378 --> 01:15:40,337
I talked to Bucky today, mentioned
your being here. He already knew it.

917
01:15:40,382 --> 01:15:43,351
Asked how you were.

918
01:15:44,386 --> 01:15:46,354
So, how are you?

919
01:15:46,388 --> 01:15:50,347
I never thought an eclipse would get
to be my idea of a good time.

920
01:15:53,395 --> 01:15:58,355
- You know what I wish?
- That this eclipse would move faster.

921
01:15:59,335 --> 01:16:02,304
I wish you didn't have
to go back to Miami.

922
01:16:07,343 --> 01:16:11,302
It's Warren Justice calling for
Pete Raymond again.

923
01:16:11,347 --> 01:16:14,316
Not Mister Warren. Mister Justice.

924
01:16:14,350 --> 01:16:19,310
If Mister Raymond doesn't know who I
am, he doesn't have to call me back.

925
01:16:23,359 --> 01:16:28,319
Another blue heaven morning here at
Radio Rock It Sock It Philadelphia.

926
01:16:28,364 --> 01:16:32,323
Channel Seven. They got the babe
that makes me shout.

927
01:16:32,368 --> 01:16:36,327
Talkin'bout Marcia, I am not.
Ooh, Tally, what you got?

928
01:16:37,373 --> 01:16:40,342
Marcia, you may be overreacting.

929
01:16:41,377 --> 01:16:46,337
She takes my broadcast with
which I am identified...

930
01:16:46,382 --> 01:16:50,341
and for which I am responsible
and she makes my broadcast...

931
01:16:50,386 --> 01:16:54,345
and by extension, me, the object
of vulgar innuendo.

932
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:58,349
The object is not you, it's me.

933
01:17:13,342 --> 01:17:16,311
- Lf you wanna talk about the DJ...
- Forget about the DJ.

934
01:17:16,345 --> 01:17:20,304
We've got an election coming up here.
Marcia knows more about politics...

935
01:17:20,349 --> 01:17:23,318
than the polls do. So, I offered her
Senior Political Correspondent and...

936
01:17:23,352 --> 01:17:27,311
Director of Campaign Coverage. I don't
know whatever the title she wanted.

937
01:17:27,356 --> 01:17:30,325
And she passed.

938
01:17:32,361 --> 01:17:36,320
I want you to take over
some of her duties.

939
01:17:38,367 --> 01:17:41,336
Is that what this is all about?

940
01:17:47,376 --> 01:17:49,344
Is she staying?

941
01:17:49,378 --> 01:17:53,337
She has an offer in Cincinnati.
Anchor.

942
01:17:53,382 --> 01:17:56,351
It's nice market for her.

943
01:18:07,329 --> 01:18:10,298
You don't use hypo-allergenic?

944
01:18:10,332 --> 01:18:14,291
My red twenty-eight.
You should use twenty-nine.

945
01:18:16,338 --> 01:18:22,299
A quick comb-out and I'm ready to go
on air tomorrow night in Cincinnati.

946
01:18:26,348 --> 01:18:31,308
Quelle irony. I was offered a job
in W.M.I. A this week.

947
01:18:32,354 --> 01:18:35,323
Chris Reiss phoned me to come in
and co-anchor with Rob Sullivan.

948
01:18:35,357 --> 01:18:38,326
- Chris Reiss?
- From Chicago. Dynamite news guy.

949
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:40,328
What's he doing at M.I.A.?

950
01:18:40,362 --> 01:18:44,321
Getting along with Dan, which is more
than Warren ever bothered to do.

951
01:18:44,366 --> 01:18:50,327
Miami's a little chiquita banana for
me, but Chris is shaking things up.

952
01:18:50,372 --> 01:18:54,331
I actually considered blowing off
Cincinnati, streaking my hair...

953
01:18:54,376 --> 01:18:56,344
and going down to work with Chris.

954
01:18:56,378 --> 01:19:00,280
But, you get to be 42, you know what
it costs to jump off high board.

955
01:19:01,316 --> 01:19:05,275
You didn't know it was Chris
who replaced Warren?

956
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:11,281
- What does it take to jump off?
- You beet to be 42, you won't ask.

957
01:19:13,328 --> 01:19:16,297
It's not your fault, you know that.

958
01:19:17,332 --> 01:19:21,291
It's not anybody's fault.
This is the way it works.

959
01:19:22,337 --> 01:19:27,297
Actually, I'm forty-four.
Not even Bucky knows that.

960
01:19:32,347 --> 01:19:36,306
- Been a while, Buford.
- Good times.

961
01:19:37,352 --> 01:19:39,320
Good times.

962
01:19:43,358 --> 01:19:46,327
You're looking for a job, aren't you?

963
01:19:47,362 --> 01:19:52,322
Shit, Warren, you got a habit of
calling' a horse's ass a horse's ass.

964
01:19:52,367 --> 01:19:55,336
We got some folks around that
shop just don't appreciate that.

965
01:19:55,370 --> 01:19:58,339
You mean like Gabe Lawrence,
Vice President of Info-tainment?

966
01:19:58,373 --> 01:20:02,332
Yeah, what was it you said about
Gabe's Granada coverage?

967
01:20:02,377 --> 01:20:05,346
Blood, sweat and Perrier.

968
01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:09,339
He never made in invasion. It coincided
with a periodontal appointment.

969
01:20:09,384 --> 01:20:12,353
The flossers are in charge, now.

970
01:20:12,387 --> 01:20:17,347
I'm just a noble, fuckin' savage they
trot out to the affiliate meetings.

971
01:20:18,393 --> 01:20:22,352
Are your sources at the
Pentagon still good?

972
01:20:22,397 --> 01:20:27,357
- Think so, why?
- You might ask'em about SOUTHCOM.

973
01:20:27,402 --> 01:20:31,361
1999 we got to give back the Panama
Canal. And I can't. See that...

974
01:20:31,406 --> 01:20:34,375
happenin' without a whole bunch of
people runnin' lot of plays.

975
01:20:34,409 --> 01:20:40,370
- This intuition or you hear somethin'?
- The usual people are interested.

976
01:20:40,415 --> 01:20:42,383
You got anybody on it?

977
01:20:42,417 --> 01:20:47,377
Old Gabe don't think there's a story.
You go down there, you'd own it.

978
01:20:52,427 --> 01:20:55,396
I kind of wanted to stay
around here for a while.

979
01:20:55,430 --> 01:20:58,399
She worth it?

980
01:20:59,368 --> 01:21:02,337
Deep down, she wants
to shoot up the town.

981
01:21:02,371 --> 01:21:05,340
- I'm always good for lunch.
- You've heard all my stories.

982
01:21:05,374 --> 01:21:08,343
- Take care of yourself.
- You, too.

983
01:21:18,387 --> 01:21:23,347
- L've been trying to call you all day.
- I should tell you, I went up to NY.

984
01:21:23,392 --> 01:21:27,351
- To do what?
- You should've been up there.

985
01:21:27,396 --> 01:21:31,355
There was this street fair, on one
of the incredible New York days.

986
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:36,360
- See anybody you know?
- All these little kids runnin' around.

987
01:21:38,407 --> 01:21:42,366
- What?
- Anything happen up there?

988
01:21:44,413 --> 01:21:47,382
I got a cab driver that could
find Penn Station.

989
01:21:47,416 --> 01:21:49,384
Wait a second now.

990
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:54,389
- Is there something you don't tell me?
- You ask a lot of questions.

991
01:21:54,423 --> 01:21:57,392
I don't get a lot of answers.

992
01:21:58,427 --> 01:22:03,330
Reporters think the job in Washington
is cover their bets. Warren didn't.

993
01:22:03,365 --> 01:22:08,325
He was there to tell the story, which
didn't make him widely popular.

994
01:22:10,372 --> 01:22:13,341
Did he ever tell you
why he left the network?

995
01:22:13,375 --> 01:22:17,334
He said he made a
mistake on a story.

996
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:22,339
He trusted the source and
he shouldn't've.

997
01:22:23,385 --> 01:22:27,344
He trusted the source because
I was the source.

998
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:32,349
I took a year off from the bureau
to run briefings for State.

999
01:22:32,394 --> 01:22:37,354
Warren and I had a deal. I did what I
had to do, he did what he had to do.

1000
01:22:37,399 --> 01:22:41,358
I never dreamed for a minute
he'd by that story.

1001
01:22:41,403 --> 01:22:44,372
- But he did?
- Yeah, he did.

1002
01:22:46,408 --> 01:22:49,377
In the overall scheme of things, it
shouldn't've mattered. But it did...

1003
01:22:49,411 --> 01:22:52,380
matter because the network was looking
for an excuse and now they had one.

1004
01:22:52,414 --> 01:22:57,374
They saw him as a wild card to begin
with. He and Buford Sells had lunch.

1005
01:22:57,419 --> 01:23:04,325
"Play it the network's way or take the
highway." And Warren took the highway.

1006
01:23:06,361 --> 01:23:08,329
Buford used to be his best friend.

1007
01:23:08,363 --> 01:23:12,322
So, you see, it took a lot for
him to ask Bu for a job.

1008
01:23:18,373 --> 01:23:25,336
You do a lot for a lot of people.
There can't be many who don't owe you.

1009
01:23:26,381 --> 01:23:29,350
Now you're going to collect one.

1010
01:23:30,385 --> 01:23:32,353
You're gonna collect it for me.

1011
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:40,350
No way! I'm not gonna do it!
You do this to me, Terranova!

1012
01:23:40,395 --> 01:23:43,364
You tell me I gotta hire this guy!
I don't have to hire these guys!

1013
01:23:43,398 --> 01:23:48,358
I worked with Warren for the D.E.A.
He almost got me killed. Not now!

1014
01:23:49,404 --> 01:23:53,363
Whatever is good for the Governor.
I'll make myself available.

1015
01:23:59,348 --> 01:24:04,308
We do a series of backgrounders on
the news before it becomes news.

1016
01:24:04,353 --> 01:24:09,313
The Governor hanging his reelection
campaign on prison reform.

1017
01:24:09,358 --> 01:24:12,327
McBrides'a up twenty-four points
in the polls because...

1018
01:24:12,361 --> 01:24:17,321
the public thinks cutting inmate
privileges is the tough way to go.

1019
01:24:17,366 --> 01:24:19,334
- We ask questions.
- We?

1020
01:24:19,368 --> 01:24:21,336
You and me.

1021
01:24:23,372 --> 01:24:27,331
- Why didn't you ask me how I saw it?
- Well, how do you see it?

1022
01:24:27,376 --> 01:24:31,335
You talk to the warden.
You talk to the guards.

1023
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:35,339
McBride thinks he's being tough?
My bet is he's just being butch.

1024
01:24:35,384 --> 01:24:38,353
The you'll do it?

1025
01:24:38,387 --> 01:24:43,347
- We could see each other all day long.
- You want something, you don't give up.

1026
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:48,352
- There's something else I want.
- I'll do one thing I don't want.

1027
01:24:48,397 --> 01:24:50,365
What other things you got in mind?

1028
01:24:55,404 --> 01:24:57,372
Marry me.

1029
01:24:58,407 --> 01:25:00,307
What?

1030
01:25:01,343 --> 01:25:03,311
Marry me.

1031
01:25:05,347 --> 01:25:07,315
I been married.

1032
01:25:07,349 --> 01:25:11,308
Twice. Bad idea. Twice.

1033
01:25:11,353 --> 01:25:15,312
I want you around in the morning.

1034
01:25:17,359 --> 01:25:21,318
You already have me in the morning.
How, I don't know, but you do.

1035
01:25:23,365 --> 01:25:27,324
I wanna know you're legally
required to be there.

1036
01:25:35,377 --> 01:25:38,346
...with the power vested in me,
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1037
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:40,348
You may kiss your bride.

1038
01:25:50,392 --> 01:25:55,352
Getting the Rotary-lunch speech
from the warden won't do it.

1039
01:25:55,397 --> 01:25:58,366
But if we'd show how McBride's reforms
are affecting just one inmate...

1040
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:03,303
A Day in the Life,
then that would tell the story.

1041
01:26:03,338 --> 01:26:08,298
- You listening to me or not?
- I thought this was our night off.

1042
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:18,319
My wife, the candy ass.

1043
01:26:31,366 --> 01:26:34,335
Did our night off end at midnight?

1044
01:26:34,369 --> 01:26:40,330
Remember Fernando Buttanda? The father
of the New Years baby. Miami. Layette?

1045
01:26:40,375 --> 01:26:42,343
Rob and I fighting on the air?

1046
01:26:42,377 --> 01:26:44,345
They sent him up here.

1047
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:47,348
To Holmesburg.

1048
01:26:47,382 --> 01:26:50,351
He's the Day in the Life.

1049
01:26:52,387 --> 01:26:56,346
Fullscreen headline:
Governor Signs Prison Reform Act.

1050
01:26:56,391 --> 01:26:59,292
Cut to McBride.
Smash into his campaign bites.

1051
01:26:59,327 --> 01:27:02,296
"Holmesburg is a prison. It's not
a resort. Holmesburg works."

1052
01:27:02,330 --> 01:27:07,290
- We show the jump in the polls.
- Then we have this one prisoner...

1053
01:27:07,335 --> 01:27:11,294
and the effect on him when McBride
take out the TV sets and laptops.

1054
01:27:11,339 --> 01:27:14,308
And also defunded all rehab
and vocational training.

1055
01:27:14,342 --> 01:27:17,311
- What else?
- What do you... what else?

1056
01:27:17,345 --> 01:27:20,314
I just get the sense you may be
coming down heavy on McBride.

1057
01:27:20,348 --> 01:27:26,309
Is it heavy to say that McBride has
been pedding nitro to get reelected?

1058
01:27:26,354 --> 01:27:31,314
Do I think the crime issue is
manipulated for political ends? Yes.

1059
01:27:31,359 --> 01:27:35,318
- Then what are we talking about?
- Do many people wanna hear this?

1060
01:27:35,363 --> 01:27:37,331
Not necessarily.

1061
01:27:37,365 --> 01:27:40,334
- John's concern is...
- I know what's John's concern is.

1062
01:27:40,368 --> 01:27:42,336
I think John's feeling is...

1063
01:27:42,370 --> 01:27:47,330
He wants us to tell the viewers
what he thinks they wanna hear.

1064
01:27:49,377 --> 01:27:53,336
Did you ever entertain any idea you
didn't get from a focus group, John?

1065
01:27:53,381 --> 01:27:58,341
You stake out the moral high ground.
Everybody else gets altitude sickness.

1066
01:27:59,321 --> 01:28:03,280
You think I want this kind of shit?
You think I even wanted this project?

1067
01:28:03,325 --> 01:28:07,284
She wanted it. She's the one who's
out there on the line.

1068
01:28:07,329 --> 01:28:11,288
And the only reason she's out there is
to give you something to do!

1069
01:28:13,335 --> 01:28:16,304
Actually, I've got something to do.

1070
01:28:29,351 --> 01:28:31,319
You thought he'd show up?

1071
01:28:31,353 --> 01:28:35,312
He cooled down? Lt's a great story.

1072
01:28:36,358 --> 01:28:40,317
He's a professional.
Inspiring stuff like that?

1073
01:28:42,364 --> 01:28:44,332
Let's go in and set up.

1074
01:28:44,366 --> 01:28:47,335
Warren Justice for Colonel Peters.

1075
01:28:55,377 --> 01:28:56,344
Barry?

1076
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:03,283
Long time, right. Are you still
covering Panama for the Pentagon?

1077
01:29:06,321 --> 01:29:11,281
Oye me. I was working in the
infirmary all day with...

1078
01:29:11,326 --> 01:29:16,286
- I don't know how to say, los locos?
- The disturbed.

1079
01:29:17,332 --> 01:29:22,292
And I like it. And then
they go and shut down the program.

1080
01:29:24,339 --> 01:29:28,298
And when they shut down the gym,
like they say they're going to do...

1081
01:29:28,343 --> 01:29:33,303
everybody in here is going to be loco.

1082
01:29:33,348 --> 01:29:35,316
Disturbed.

1083
01:29:35,350 --> 01:29:39,309
Actually, I'll be in Washington later
today. Maybe we could just...

1084
01:29:40,355 --> 01:29:43,324
sit down and chew the fat.

1085
01:29:44,359 --> 01:29:46,327
About this and that.

1086
01:29:46,361 --> 01:29:49,330
Specifically?
I'll call you when I get there.

1087
01:29:51,366 --> 01:29:54,335
If you need anything more, this TV
is light duty, so call me.

1088
01:29:54,369 --> 01:29:56,337
Thank you so much.
You were so helpful.

1089
01:29:58,373 --> 01:30:02,332
You get over there!
They'll let you out?

1090
01:30:15,390 --> 01:30:19,349
...all units, especially those in
vicinity of Holmesburg Prison.

1091
01:30:19,394 --> 01:30:25,355
Prisoners took control of the gym
and 2 cellblocks. 10 to 12 hostages.

1092
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:32,363
...crew from Channel Seven had
been filming when riot broke out.

1093
01:30:57,432 --> 01:31:02,335
You throw the power, the guards are
dead. Stop chicken shitting around.

1094
01:31:02,370 --> 01:31:06,329
- The Governor doesn't want...
- What's he got to do with this?

1095
01:31:06,374 --> 01:31:08,342
- The Mayor and the Commissioner...
- Get the Commissioner on the phone!

1096
01:31:08,376 --> 01:31:10,344
Anything on the Channel
Seven News Crew?

1097
01:31:10,378 --> 01:31:13,347
Gary Logan, I.B.S. The warden's
gonna be briefing me...

1098
01:31:13,381 --> 01:31:16,350
Warden. Excuse me, Warden.

1099
01:31:16,384 --> 01:31:20,343
There's a Channel Seven reporter
still inside. Is he alive?

1100
01:31:20,388 --> 01:31:23,357
We won't know until we go in.

1101
01:31:48,416 --> 01:31:52,375
I'm getting something on the line.
It may be Tally trying to feed.

1102
01:31:58,426 --> 01:32:03,329
- Is Ned shooting this?
- Somebody is. Roll a protection copy.

1103
01:32:06,367 --> 01:32:08,335
Tal?

1104
01:32:09,370 --> 01:32:12,339
Are you there?

1105
01:32:16,377 --> 01:32:19,346
Tal, it's me. Are you there?
Can you hear me?

1106
01:32:22,383 --> 01:32:25,352
- Tal, can you hear me?
- I hear you!

1107
01:32:25,386 --> 01:32:28,355
Stay against the wall.
Watch your back.

1108
01:32:30,391 --> 01:32:34,350
Okay, you've got one thing going
for you. You've got the camera.

1109
01:32:34,395 --> 01:32:37,364
Whatever you do, do it on air.
It's the only weapon you've got.

1110
01:32:37,398 --> 01:32:41,357
You're their chance to tell the world
what's going on. Use the camera.

1111
01:32:41,402 --> 01:32:43,370
I'm not on air!

1112
01:32:43,404 --> 01:32:47,363
They don't know that.
Before they do, you will be.

1113
01:32:50,411 --> 01:32:53,380
Keep it out there. It's going to
protect you. Keep it in his face.

1114
01:32:53,414 --> 01:32:55,382
Who the hell are you?

1115
01:32:55,416 --> 01:32:58,385
Four, three, two, one!

1116
01:32:58,419 --> 01:33:03,322
Holmesburg Prison, live. Come on,
just say it where it will be heard.

1117
01:33:03,358 --> 01:33:07,317
- This is Tally Atwater live from...
- Tape it. It's not gonna be perfect.

1118
01:33:07,362 --> 01:33:11,321
First of all, we demand
full TVback!

1119
01:33:11,366 --> 01:33:14,335
- They're feeding. They can see us.
- You're now feeding live.

1120
01:33:14,369 --> 01:33:19,329
We'll try now to go to Tally Atwater
for a Channel Seven exclusive report.

1121
01:33:20,375 --> 01:33:25,335
This is Tally Atwater reporting
live in Holmesburg Prison.

1122
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:28,349
At approximately four
fifteen this afternoon...

1123
01:33:28,383 --> 01:33:33,343
the whistle sounded that all across
this country means, "Guard in Trouble."

1124
01:33:33,388 --> 01:33:36,357
Can you tell us what
precipitated this incident?

1125
01:33:59,347 --> 01:34:03,306
Okay, Warren,
coming back in thirty.

1126
01:34:11,359 --> 01:34:14,328
Tal, in thirty seconds,
you're back on air.

1127
01:34:14,362 --> 01:34:19,322
There's something happenin'in C-block.
I'm gonna try and get closer.

1128
01:34:20,368 --> 01:34:24,327
- How are you doin'?
- I'm so tired

1129
01:34:26,374 --> 01:34:28,342
You know what I keep
thinking about?

1130
01:34:30,378 --> 01:34:34,337
That time you tried to teach me
to bone fish in the Keys.

1131
01:34:34,382 --> 01:34:38,341
- I was really terrible, wasn't I?
- Well, you were okay.

1132
01:34:38,386 --> 01:34:40,354
Ten seconds.

1133
01:34:45,393 --> 01:34:49,352
Tal, the TAC teams are here.
They're taking up positions.

1134
01:34:50,398 --> 01:34:53,367
As you know, Channel Seven's
Tally Atwater...

1135
01:34:53,401 --> 01:34:57,360
and cameraman, Ned Jackson
remain inside Holmesburg Prison...

1136
01:34:57,405 --> 01:35:00,306
where they have been reporting
exclusively...

1137
01:35:00,341 --> 01:35:04,300
...for WFIL.
- Merino.

1138
01:35:04,345 --> 01:35:09,305
The Team was inside the prison
interviewing inmates for a special...

1139
01:35:09,350 --> 01:35:11,318
report when the riot broke out.

1140
01:35:11,352 --> 01:35:15,311
The network wants to go live,
national.

1141
01:35:15,356 --> 01:35:17,324
It's your show.

1142
01:35:17,358 --> 01:35:21,317
Let's try to go live, once again, to
Tally Atwater. What can you tell us?

1143
01:35:21,362 --> 01:35:26,322
We've been told that tactical assault
teams are taking up positions...

1144
01:35:26,367 --> 01:35:31,327
outside, even as I speak. Should
there be an onslaught, prisoners...

1145
01:35:34,375 --> 01:35:37,344
What the hell? Tal! Can you hear me?

1146
01:35:37,378 --> 01:35:40,347
- Goddamn it!
- What's going on?

1147
01:35:40,381 --> 01:35:42,349
We lost her.

1148
01:35:44,385 --> 01:35:49,345
- Warren, what's happening?
- Tally, are you there? Do you hear me?

1149
01:35:56,397 --> 01:35:59,298
We're here in Holmesburg Prison,
where the SWATteam has come in.

1150
01:35:59,333 --> 01:36:02,302
Philadelphia, hang on. New York, what?

1151
01:36:02,336 --> 01:36:07,296
They don't have audio either.
When we do, we'll let you know.

1152
01:36:08,342 --> 01:36:13,302
If we get it, when we get it, we're
gonna go national. That's right.

1153
01:36:21,355 --> 01:36:25,314
You wanna hold in New York City?
Civil rights attorney...

1154
01:36:25,359 --> 01:36:28,328
prisoner's advocate,
Gary Mandinak.

1155
01:36:28,362 --> 01:36:32,321
Gentlemen, thank you forjoining
us at this very late hour.

1156
01:36:35,369 --> 01:36:38,338
- Is it, is it her?
- Wait a minute.

1157
01:36:38,372 --> 01:36:40,340
We got something.

1158
01:36:41,375 --> 01:36:44,344
- Fernando?
- Tal, can you hear me?

1159
01:37:10,338 --> 01:37:13,307
Open this door!
Open it! Open it!

1160
01:37:13,341 --> 01:37:16,310
Tal, can you hear me?

1161
01:37:17,345 --> 01:37:19,313
Are you okay?

1162
01:37:19,347 --> 01:37:21,315
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

1163
01:37:23,351 --> 01:37:27,310
Fernando?
Can I talk to you?

1164
01:37:29,357 --> 01:37:34,317
Question. Are you now saying that you
have this situation under control?

1165
01:37:34,362 --> 01:37:37,331
- Under control.
- How is that possible?

1166
01:37:38,366 --> 01:37:41,335
They're claiming control...
ask her about it.

1167
01:37:41,369 --> 01:37:45,328
Tally, we're getting word that the
situation there is under control.

1168
01:37:45,373 --> 01:37:48,342
You're feeding live, Tal. National.

1169
01:37:48,376 --> 01:37:53,336
- Well... the inmates have the control.
- Which inmates?

1170
01:37:53,381 --> 01:37:56,350
Or... more accurately one
group of inmates has control.

1171
01:37:56,384 --> 01:38:00,286
This has not been good news
for other inmates.

1172
01:38:00,321 --> 01:38:04,280
Of the 8 men have been killed today,
none, repeat none have been guards.

1173
01:38:04,325 --> 01:38:07,294
One of the eight dead inmates...

1174
01:38:07,328 --> 01:38:11,287
one was apparently shot by tower
guard. The other seven...

1175
01:38:11,332 --> 01:38:16,292
were victims of continuing racial
vendettas here...

1176
01:38:16,337 --> 01:38:19,306
No more gang shit, Tally.

1177
01:38:19,340 --> 01:38:23,299
Fernando, how much more time do
you have left on your sentence?

1178
01:38:24,345 --> 01:38:29,305
Ah, madre. I got fifteen months,
and then I come up for parole.

1179
01:38:29,350 --> 01:38:34,310
You know what's going to happen when
the guards come in. You'd end up dead.

1180
01:38:34,355 --> 01:38:37,324
I could end up dead
on Biscayne Boulevard.

1181
01:38:41,362 --> 01:38:46,322
It's two AM. The riot has been
underway for close to ten hours.

1182
01:38:46,367 --> 01:38:51,327
We're back live with W.F.I.L.
Philadelphia Tally Atwater...

1183
01:38:51,372 --> 01:38:54,341
who is inside Holmesburg Prison.

1184
01:38:54,375 --> 01:38:58,334
Tally's been keeping us informed
from her bird's eye view of the riot.

1185
01:38:58,379 --> 01:39:02,281
- What's the mood?
- Describe the scene. Can you, Tally?

1186
01:39:02,316 --> 01:39:06,275
The mood here, Tom, is ominous.
Inmates are prepared...

1187
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:11,280
for what they believe will be the
final assault. Probably before dawn.

1188
01:39:11,325 --> 01:39:15,284
- They give indication they'll fight.
- Are they armed?

1189
01:39:16,330 --> 01:39:21,290
Because to fight is a way of life,
life learned on the streets.

1190
01:39:21,335 --> 01:39:25,294
To see the faces inside this
prison, is to remember that...

1191
01:39:25,339 --> 01:39:30,299
on such streets crime isjust
a way of taking care of business.

1192
01:39:30,344 --> 01:39:34,303
This is Tally Atwater
inside Holmesburg Prison.

1193
01:39:35,349 --> 01:39:37,317
Get it down?

1194
01:40:06,380 --> 01:40:11,340
You're watching live footage of
the riot at Holmesburg Prison.

1195
01:40:11,385 --> 01:40:14,354
W.F.I.L. 's Tally Atwater and
cameraman, Ned Jackson...

1196
01:40:14,388 --> 01:40:18,347
are inside the prison,
as you see by these...

1197
01:40:18,392 --> 01:40:22,351
dramatic pictures that we're getting.
The TAC team has entered the prison.

1198
01:40:22,396 --> 01:40:26,355
In the next minutes and hours,
the matter will be resolved.

1199
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:30,359
Now the question is,
how high the price?

1200
01:40:37,411 --> 01:40:39,379
Can you hear me, Tal?

1201
01:40:40,414 --> 01:40:42,382
You see anything?

1202
01:40:44,418 --> 01:40:46,386
I guess... Turn around.

1203
01:40:47,421 --> 01:40:49,389
don't get shot, guys.

1204
01:40:56,430 --> 01:41:00,332
Stand by. We've lost Tal. When we
get her back, we'll let you know.

1205
01:41:45,413 --> 01:41:49,372
Twenty-four hours ago,
I came to Holmesburg Prison...

1206
01:41:49,417 --> 01:41:54,377
to report on how Governor George
McBride new "get tough'policies...

1207
01:41:54,422 --> 01:41:56,390
were affecting one convict.

1208
01:41:56,424 --> 01:42:00,326
It was meant to be A Day in the
Life of Fernando Buttanda.

1209
01:42:02,363 --> 01:42:06,322
Fernando Buttanda was not a good
man by society's standards.

1210
01:42:06,367 --> 01:42:09,336
He was not even a good man
by his own standards.

1211
01:42:09,370 --> 01:42:15,331
Recently, however, in a job-training
program here at Holmesburg...

1212
01:42:15,376 --> 01:42:18,345
Fernando began to learn
nursing skills.

1213
01:42:18,379 --> 01:42:21,348
He volunteered to work
in the prison hospital...

1214
01:42:21,382 --> 01:42:25,341
at some risk to himself,
with violent patients.

1215
01:42:25,386 --> 01:42:28,355
He was good at it.
He liked doing it.

1216
01:42:30,391 --> 01:42:34,350
A month ago, Governor McBride,
who is campaigning for reelection...

1217
01:42:34,395 --> 01:42:38,354
on the pledge to "reform" other
Pennsylvania prisons...

1218
01:42:38,399 --> 01:42:43,359
as he "reformed" Holmesburg,
canceled this program.

1219
01:42:43,404 --> 01:42:46,373
"A prison is about punishment."

1220
01:42:46,407 --> 01:42:50,366
He added, "it's not"
about another chance."

1221
01:42:50,411 --> 01:42:56,372
During the next weeks, we'll hear a
lot about what prisons should be.

1222
01:42:56,417 --> 01:43:01,320
A lot opinions as to why this riot
occurred, in this place, at this time.

1223
01:43:01,355 --> 01:43:05,314
Many fixes will be proposed,
many answers formulated.

1224
01:43:05,359 --> 01:43:10,319
Inside Holmesburg Prison last night,
answers were harder to come by.

1225
01:43:10,364 --> 01:43:13,333
What we do know is that
fifteen prisoners died...

1226
01:43:13,367 --> 01:43:16,336
including Fernando Buttanda.

1227
01:43:16,370 --> 01:43:21,330
This is Tally Atwater, W.F.I.L.
News, Holmesburg Prison.

1228
01:43:21,375 --> 01:43:26,335
Thank you, Tally. And we'll be
recapping all of Tally's coverage...

1229
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:28,348
You were good.

1230
01:43:29,383 --> 01:43:33,342
No... you were great.

1231
01:44:57,404 --> 01:45:01,306
Tally Atwater for Mark Lindner.

1232
01:45:02,343 --> 01:45:05,312
This is as far as I go.

1233
01:45:05,346 --> 01:45:09,305
One floor up,
the first door on your left.

1234
01:45:15,356 --> 01:45:19,315
Miss Atwater, I'm Mark Lindner.
It's good of you to come and see us.

1235
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:23,319
- Would you like coffee, a soft drink?
- No, thank you, I'm fine.

1236
01:45:23,364 --> 01:45:27,323
Karen, you know what call to put
through. This is Buford Sells.

1237
01:45:27,368 --> 01:45:30,337
- How do you do? Lt's a real pleasure.
- And Gabe Lawrence.

1238
01:45:30,371 --> 01:45:33,340
- How are you?
- Have a seat.

1239
01:45:33,374 --> 01:45:38,334
For better or worse, we're the Three
Musketeers who run the News Division.

1240
01:45:38,379 --> 01:45:41,348
That was quite a job
you did for us at Holmesburg.

1241
01:45:45,386 --> 01:45:47,354
don't get up.

1242
01:45:51,392 --> 01:45:54,361
- So.
- So.

1243
01:45:54,395 --> 01:45:59,298
- Well, tell me what they said.
- Washington Bureau...

1244
01:45:59,333 --> 01:46:03,292
weekend anchor, evening news.

1245
01:46:03,337 --> 01:46:05,305
I said l'd think about it.

1246
01:46:05,339 --> 01:46:09,298
- Can I help you?
- We'll wait.

1247
01:46:09,343 --> 01:46:12,312
- Sure.
- Weekend anchor?

1248
01:46:12,346 --> 01:46:14,314
What's to think about?

1249
01:46:15,349 --> 01:46:19,308
Well, actually what I think is,
we make a pretty good team.

1250
01:46:20,354 --> 01:46:23,323
It's no good that way.
We tried. It doesn't work.

1251
01:46:23,357 --> 01:46:27,316
- We did Holmesburg. It worked.
- No, you did Holmesburg.

1252
01:46:27,361 --> 01:46:30,330
And you did it yourself.
And you were terrific.

1253
01:46:30,364 --> 01:46:34,323
I think there's a story in
Panama nobody's telling.

1254
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:39,328
L've a hunch that some people would
like to see us get into a war...

1255
01:46:39,373 --> 01:46:42,342
"cause they're not that enthusiastic
about turning over the Canal in 1999.

1256
01:46:42,376 --> 01:46:45,345
We can do Panama.

1257
01:46:45,379 --> 01:46:49,338
- Networks aren't interested.
- We can make them interested.

1258
01:46:49,383 --> 01:46:53,342
I can go into Panama City, spend a
few days, pick up a local crew...

1259
01:46:53,387 --> 01:46:55,355
and head out.

1260
01:46:55,389 --> 01:46:57,357
You already set this up.

1261
01:47:05,332 --> 01:47:08,301
Yeah. L've gotta do this by
myself. Do you see that?

1262
01:47:08,335 --> 01:47:13,295
- Wasn't the idea for us to be together?
- It was.

1263
01:47:13,340 --> 01:47:17,299
But it can't be me putting wine on ice
while you wrap up the evening news.

1264
01:47:17,344 --> 01:47:22,304
And it can't be you turning down a
story 'cause you don't wanna leave me.

1265
01:47:25,352 --> 01:47:27,320
Do you wanna be with me?

1266
01:47:30,357 --> 01:47:33,326
So much that it hurts.

1267
01:47:37,364 --> 01:47:42,324
I don't wanna be anywhere I can't see
you, touch you, hear your voice...

1268
01:47:42,369 --> 01:47:47,329
or tell you a story,
or see this great smile.

1269
01:47:50,377 --> 01:47:55,337
But I've got a narrow but very
definite window of opportunity.

1270
01:47:56,383 --> 01:47:59,284
And if I can get this...

1271
01:48:01,321 --> 01:48:03,289
- And if...
...we get lucky...

1272
01:48:03,323 --> 01:48:05,291
...gold!

1273
01:48:06,326 --> 01:48:12,287
- Do you really want this?
- You made me want it.

1274
01:48:18,338 --> 01:48:21,307
Flight 811 to Miami,
Belize and Panama...

1275
01:48:21,341 --> 01:48:26,301
is in its final boarding process.
Passengers should be aboard.

1276
01:48:26,346 --> 01:48:29,315
We haven't had enough time.

1277
01:48:30,350 --> 01:48:34,309
Every day we have is one day
more than we deserve.

1278
01:48:35,355 --> 01:48:38,324
I'm gonna tell you the best
story you've ever heard.

1279
01:48:59,313 --> 01:49:01,281
Uh, darling?

1280
01:49:05,319 --> 01:49:07,287
Oh! Been a while since I've done this.

1281
01:49:07,321 --> 01:49:09,289
Have fun.

1282
01:49:15,329 --> 01:49:18,298
Stay upwind.

1283
01:49:33,347 --> 01:49:36,316
...to explore possible
repercussions to our economy.

1284
01:49:36,350 --> 01:49:41,310
Meanwhile the dollar continued its
freefall against the yen and the mark.

1285
01:49:41,355 --> 01:49:44,324
We'll be discussing this latest run
on the dollar tomorrow night...

1286
01:49:44,358 --> 01:49:48,317
on American Notebook with Treasury
Secretary, Willis Barry.

1287
01:49:48,362 --> 01:49:51,331
This is Tom Orr.
I'll see you then.

1288
01:49:54,368 --> 01:49:58,327
- Tally, how are you?
- Go on, sit down, He won't bite.

1289
01:50:03,377 --> 01:50:08,337
don't get too attached to that chair.
You know, I call it home.

1290
01:50:09,383 --> 01:50:11,351
Have you got the uplink?

1291
01:50:13,387 --> 01:50:18,347
We're gonna try out a new stringer. Just
chat him along. We've got some minutes.

1292
01:50:20,394 --> 01:50:25,354
Satellite time costs money, boys!
Run him out here.

1293
01:50:28,402 --> 01:50:30,370
Here he is.

1294
01:50:33,407 --> 01:50:39,368
That has to be the dirtiest excuse
for a reporter I have ever seen.

1295
01:50:39,413 --> 01:50:42,382
My God, it's the anchor person.

1296
01:50:43,417 --> 01:50:47,376
New hairdo, I'll bet.
Shoe shined.

1297
01:50:47,421 --> 01:50:52,381
Hey, Buford, get the hell outta here.
I wanna talk to my wife alone.

1298
01:50:55,429 --> 01:50:58,398
- Miss me?
- Occasionally.

1299
01:50:58,432 --> 01:51:00,332
When are you coming home?

1300
01:51:00,367 --> 01:51:04,326
I got a few more days in the
boonies. Then I can wrap this up.

1301
01:51:04,371 --> 01:51:08,330
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, I got it. I nailed it.

1302
01:51:10,377 --> 01:51:15,337
- You look so good.
- I'm sort of glad I can't see you.

1303
01:51:16,383 --> 01:51:18,351
The mind...

1304
01:51:18,385 --> 01:51:20,353
it's a wonderful, dirty thing.

1305
01:51:21,388 --> 01:51:23,356
But wait.

1306
01:51:24,391 --> 01:51:26,359
Just one more thing I wanted
to tell you.

1307
01:51:28,395 --> 01:51:31,364
God, I'm havin' fun.

1308
01:51:50,417 --> 01:51:54,376
Okay, first of all...
I'm gonna try not to cry.

1309
01:51:54,421 --> 01:51:59,324
This is for Warren, who couldn't
quite make the party...

1310
01:51:59,359 --> 01:52:04,319
but is definitely on his way back
home from what he call hog heaven.

1311
01:52:06,366 --> 01:52:12,327
Ned, who is one of two people who
knows what I look like in the morning.

1312
01:52:13,373 --> 01:52:15,341
Where is he? Ned?

1313
01:52:16,376 --> 01:52:18,344
What are you doing?

1314
01:52:25,385 --> 01:52:30,345
Usually, for these farewell bashes,
I only budget domestic bubbly.

1315
01:52:33,393 --> 01:52:37,352
To repeat, reports are sketchy.

1316
01:52:37,397 --> 01:52:42,357
But we're receiving word that in the
remote Darien section of Panama...

1317
01:52:42,402 --> 01:52:47,362
a freelance news crew came under
heavy fire within the past 24 hours.

1318
01:52:47,407 --> 01:52:51,366
The group included
at least one American.

1319
01:52:57,417 --> 01:53:01,319
- We don't know if the survivors...
- Enough of Bulgarian bullshit!

1320
01:53:01,354 --> 01:53:03,322
L've liberated the hard liquor!

1321
01:53:03,356 --> 01:53:08,316
We can now confirm by this startling,
unedited footage that the American...

1322
01:53:08,361 --> 01:53:13,321
is former I.B. S newsman,
Warren Justice.

1323
01:53:15,368 --> 01:53:17,336
There he is. He's okay.

1324
01:53:19,372 --> 01:53:21,340
Get down!

1325
01:53:21,374 --> 01:53:25,333
Lt's now definitely confirmed that
at least two crew members survived.

1326
01:53:25,378 --> 01:53:28,347
- He's okay. He made it.
- We're trying to technically...

1327
01:53:28,381 --> 01:53:33,341
enhance these pictures so we can
confirm exactly what we are seeing.

1328
01:53:33,386 --> 01:53:36,355
We still don't know what
motivated this attack.

1329
01:53:36,389 --> 01:53:39,358
Information is contradictory...

1330
01:53:39,392 --> 01:53:42,361
but it appears to indicate
that an ambush took place...

1331
01:53:42,395 --> 01:53:47,355
at this remote airstrip near the
Colombian border in southern Panama.

1332
01:53:48,401 --> 01:53:53,361
We are hearing via telephone hook-up
with sources in Panama...

1333
01:53:53,406 --> 01:53:58,366
that Justice was investigating
reports about the arming of groups...

1334
01:53:58,411 --> 01:54:03,314
violently opposed to the turning over
of the Panama Canal.

1335
01:54:03,350 --> 01:54:05,318
Excuse me.

1336
01:54:07,354 --> 01:54:11,313
We have now confirmed that the
American traveling with this group...

1337
01:54:11,358 --> 01:54:17,319
former I.B.S. Newsman, Warren Justice,
was killed today in Panama.

1338
01:54:19,366 --> 01:54:25,327
Warren Justice was a seasoned
journalist and a good friend.

1339
01:54:25,372 --> 01:54:27,340
As we continue...

1340
01:54:28,375 --> 01:54:31,344
to sort this out,
we'll take a short break...

1341
01:54:31,378 --> 01:54:35,337
to allow our stations
to identify themselves.

1342
01:54:35,382 --> 01:54:39,341
We'll have more on this breaking
story in Panama when we return.

1343
01:55:04,344 --> 01:55:07,313
This is the I.B.S. Evening News,
I'm Tom Orr.

1344
01:55:07,347 --> 01:55:12,307
Questions emerging from information
uncovered by former I.B.S. Newsman...

1345
01:55:12,352 --> 01:55:16,311
Warren Justice, before
his death in Panama...

1346
01:55:16,356 --> 01:55:20,315
are beginning to seem
uncomfortably close to home to...

1347
01:55:20,360 --> 01:55:23,329
some people in Washington.

1348
01:55:23,363 --> 01:55:29,324
This network isjust now editing tape
obtained by Justice before his death.

1349
01:55:29,369 --> 01:55:34,329
Information in this tape seems
to change the face of...

1350
01:55:43,383 --> 01:55:47,342
You know those faces.
You remember those stories.

1351
01:55:47,387 --> 01:55:51,346
They were the men and women
who made I.B.S. News this year...

1352
01:55:51,391 --> 01:55:55,350
number one in five of your
twelve top markets.

1353
01:55:56,396 --> 01:56:01,299
Next year, you can count on this:
We're going to be even better...

1354
01:56:01,334 --> 01:56:06,294
because the I.B.S. News Team just
acquired a stealth weapon.

1355
01:56:07,340 --> 01:56:11,299
You may not have caught
her on W.M.I.A.

1356
01:56:11,344 --> 01:56:14,313
You may have missed her
at W.F.I.L. News.

1357
01:56:15,348 --> 01:56:19,307
But none of us will soon forget her
award-winning coverage...

1358
01:56:19,352 --> 01:56:23,311
of the riots of Holmesburg Prison.

1359
01:56:24,357 --> 01:56:28,316
What we in the news business
must never forget is...

1360
01:56:28,361 --> 01:56:32,320
we are only as good as
the stories we tell.

1361
01:56:32,365 --> 01:56:36,324
She arrived in our business from
Smalltown, U.S.A.

1362
01:56:36,369 --> 01:56:42,330
You can say that Sallyanne knew
what she wanted, to be number one.

1363
01:56:42,375 --> 01:56:46,334
And Sallyanne, as her family
like to call Tally...

1364
01:56:46,379 --> 01:56:49,348
wouldn't take no for an answer.

1365
01:56:49,382 --> 01:56:51,350
Everyone said...

1366
01:56:51,384 --> 01:56:55,343
"You want a job in television?
You have to make a demo tape."

1367
01:56:55,388 --> 01:56:57,356
So... I made a demo.

1368
01:56:57,390 --> 01:57:03,295
Why hire Sally? Because I'm Sally,
and I'm going to be a star.

1369
01:57:03,330 --> 01:57:06,299
So, she walks into my office
that first day in Miami.

1370
01:57:06,333 --> 01:57:09,302
Skinny.
God-awful clothes.

1371
01:57:09,336 --> 01:57:14,296
Not much goin' for her. Wanting
to be anybody but herself.

1372
01:57:14,341 --> 01:57:18,300
And I make her get my shirts and
I make her get the coffee.

1373
01:57:18,345 --> 01:57:23,305
I shoot down all of her stories.
But she was tougher than me.

1374
01:57:23,350 --> 01:57:25,318
She was already something.

1375
01:57:27,354 --> 01:57:32,314
She was already the sun and the
moon, all by herself.

1376
01:57:34,361 --> 01:57:38,320
We at I.B.S. Hold a special
place in our hearts...

1377
01:57:38,365 --> 01:57:41,334
for that honored handful of
news men and women...

1378
01:57:42,369 --> 01:57:47,329
whose lives and careers, in the course
of bringing home the news...

1379
01:57:48,375 --> 01:57:53,335
have been cut tragically short.
We salute them.

1380
01:57:55,382 --> 01:58:01,287
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to
begin a new generation at I.B.S.

1381
01:58:01,321 --> 01:58:04,290
Tally Atwater.

1382
01:58:35,355 --> 01:58:40,315
Panama turned out to be
a big story for I.B.S.

1383
01:58:40,360 --> 01:58:42,328
It didn't start that way.

1384
01:58:42,362 --> 01:58:46,321
It started with one reporter...

1385
01:58:47,367 --> 01:58:49,335
who had a hunch.

1386
01:58:49,369 --> 01:58:54,329
He had a hunch. And he went alone.
And he did all the leg-work.

1387
01:58:54,374 --> 01:58:58,333
And, at the end of the day,
he got it.

1388
01:59:01,314 --> 01:59:04,283
Which is what going this
is all about.

1389
01:59:06,319 --> 01:59:11,279
I didn't always think that. I thought
if I ever stood up at something like...

1390
01:59:11,324 --> 01:59:16,284
that, it would be about glory or,
showing people.

1391
01:59:18,331 --> 01:59:22,290
It's different.
I know that now.

1392
01:59:25,338 --> 01:59:28,307
I'm only here for one reason.

1393
01:59:28,341 --> 01:59:30,309
To tell the story.

1394
01:59:31,344 --> 01:59:35,303
My husband told me that,
not so long ago.
