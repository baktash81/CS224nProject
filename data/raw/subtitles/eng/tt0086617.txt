1
00:01:43,346 --> 00:01:45,812
June 25, 1965.

2
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:51,209
Dossier H-10: Hamilton, Guy.

3
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,373
Born 1936,
under the sign of Capricorn.

4
00:01:56,448 --> 00:02:00,211
Occupation: Journalist with the
Australian Broadcasting Service.

5
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:05,214
Jakarta. First assignment
as foreign correspondent.

6
00:02:22,418 --> 00:02:25,510
You're an enemy here, Hamilton,
like all Westerners.

7
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:29,386
President Sukarno
tells the West to go to hell...

8
00:02:29,453 --> 00:02:32,511
and today Sukarno
is the voice of the Third World.

9
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:34,553
- Where you get visa?
- Sydney.

10
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:43,820
Something wrong with that?

11
00:02:49,156 --> 00:02:51,418
Mr. Hamilton? Mr. Hamilton?

12
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,148
- Welcome to Indonesia.
- Thanks. You're...

13
00:02:55,224 --> 00:02:57,122
Kumar, from Jakarta office.

14
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:59,124
Hortono. Driver.

15
00:02:59,192 --> 00:03:01,851
- Where's Potter?
- Mr. Potter has gone. He left this.

16
00:03:01,925 --> 00:03:03,186
Where's he gone?

17
00:03:03,258 --> 00:03:05,282
Back to Australia.

18
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,620
Please follow me.

19
00:03:17,061 --> 00:03:20,027
He was supposed to stay
and brief me.

20
00:03:20,095 --> 00:03:22,288
He said he was sorry.
His wife was sick.

21
00:03:22,362 --> 00:03:23,692
Of what? Him?

22
00:03:23,762 --> 00:03:26,456
No, of Jakarta, boss.

23
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,859
Our first air-conditioned hotel.

24
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,899
Here, Americans and Europeans
pay to be kept cold.

25
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:56,358
Who's this?

26
00:03:56,434 --> 00:03:57,695
CIA.

27
00:03:57,768 --> 00:04:00,166
Nah, he's an embassy office boy.
Look at him.

28
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:03,731
You're both wrong.
He's the new A.B.S. Man.

29
00:04:03,802 --> 00:04:06,394
How did our diminutive friend
know that?

30
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,402
That little twerp knows everything.

31
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,993
Guy Hamilton, right?

32
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,059
- Right.
- Billy Kwan.

33
00:04:13,137 --> 00:04:14,899
I did a lot of film work
for Potter.

34
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:16,459
How do you do?

35
00:04:16,537 --> 00:04:18,730
I felt sorry for you.

36
00:04:18,804 --> 00:04:21,703
Dumped in your first posting
without contacts.

37
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:25,068
Adrift, hoping to
bluff your way through.

38
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,696
Wally O'Sullivan, Sydney Herald.

39
00:04:26,773 --> 00:04:28,705
- Read your stuff.
- Mere trifles, dear boy.

40
00:04:28,773 --> 00:04:30,762
Kevin Condon,
photo journo for Theta.

41
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,534
- And Pete Curtis, Washington Post.
- Hi.

42
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,369
- Pleasant flight?
- Yeah, it was all right.

43
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,430
- This your first overseas post?
- Yes, it is. Yeah.

44
00:04:38,642 --> 00:04:41,574
Pity about Potter takin' off.
Can be hard here without contacts.

45
00:04:41,642 --> 00:04:43,506
I'll survive.

46
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,167
- Taxi, sir?
- No, thanks.

47
00:04:49,243 --> 00:04:51,835
You should take a taxi.
It's dangerous walking there.

48
00:04:53,977 --> 00:04:55,909
- Taxi, sir?
- No.

49
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:06,877
Most of us become children again
when we enter the slums of Asia.

50
00:05:06,946 --> 00:05:11,073
Last night I watched you
walk back into childhood...

51
00:05:11,147 --> 00:05:14,136
in all its opposite intensities...

52
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:18,375
laughter and misery,
the crazy and the grim...

53
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:20,641
toy town and a city of fear.

54
00:05:24,182 --> 00:05:25,739
Hey, English, huh?

55
00:05:38,752 --> 00:05:40,240
Hey, capitalist.

56
00:05:40,318 --> 00:05:41,909
Is it always like that here?

57
00:05:41,985 --> 00:05:44,918
Don't take it personally.
You're just a symbol of the West.

58
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:47,808
Feel more like a spittoon.

59
00:05:48,953 --> 00:05:51,920
- Where are we going?
- This is a little market for the poor.

60
00:05:56,621 --> 00:06:00,577
"And the people asked Him, saying,
'What shall we do then?"'

61
00:06:00,655 --> 00:06:02,713
- What's that?
- It's from Luke.

62
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:04,311
Chapter 3, verse 10.

63
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:08,379
"What then must we do?"
Tolstoy asked the same question.

64
00:06:08,456 --> 00:06:10,422
He wrote a book with that title.

65
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,548
He got so upset
about the poverty in Moscow...

66
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:16,454
that he went one night
into the poorest section...

67
00:06:16,524 --> 00:06:19,013
and just gave away
all his money.

68
00:06:20,392 --> 00:06:22,449
You could do that now.

69
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:25,390
Five American dollars would be a fortune
to one of these people.

70
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:27,755
Wouldn't do any good.
Just be a drop in the ocean.

71
00:06:27,826 --> 00:06:31,691
Ah. That's the same conclusion
Tolstoy came to.

72
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:34,556
- I disagree.
- What's your solution?

73
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:39,390
Well, I support the view that you just
don't think about the major issues.

74
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:42,791
You do whatever you can about
the misery that's in front of you.

75
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:44,852
Add your light
to the sum of light.

76
00:06:46,596 --> 00:06:48,529
- You think that's naive?
- Yup.

77
00:06:48,597 --> 00:06:51,995
- It's all right. Most journalists do.
- We can't afford to get involved.

78
00:06:52,064 --> 00:06:53,996
Typical journo's answer.

79
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:57,495
Good luck for tomorrow.
You'll need it.

80
00:06:57,564 --> 00:07:00,122
Go home. Get some sleep.

81
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:08,361
Take the one behind me.

82
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:12,196
You're ambitious, self-contained...

83
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:17,360
moderate to conservative in politics,
and despite your naïveté...

84
00:07:17,434 --> 00:07:22,367
I sense a potential,
something immediately apparent.

85
00:07:22,435 --> 00:07:24,425
A possibility.

86
00:07:24,503 --> 00:07:26,628
Could you be the unmet friend?

87
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:49,837
Boss, take off your sunglasses
when you go in.

88
00:07:49,906 --> 00:07:52,600
Palace guards say they can
tell assassin by his eyes.

89
00:08:32,414 --> 00:08:34,346
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

90
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:35,675
Missed anything?

91
00:08:35,747 --> 00:08:39,373
Yeah, 63 minutes
of excruciating boredom.

92
00:08:39,448 --> 00:08:42,142
I got a feeling he's gonna make
a pronouncement this morning.

93
00:08:42,215 --> 00:08:44,340
Oh, really, Kevin?
What makes you say that?

94
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,814
- Just a thought.
- Yeah?

95
00:08:46,883 --> 00:08:50,441
When a thought crosses your mind, it's
been on the shortest trip in Jakarta.

96
00:08:50,517 --> 00:08:52,177
What happens next?

97
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,183
Soon as Sukarno's finished breakfast,
we go up.

98
00:08:54,251 --> 00:08:58,513
- How do you know when he's finished?
- He throws his scraps to us.

99
00:09:01,552 --> 00:09:03,279
Sorry, chaps.
Age before beauty.

100
00:09:20,422 --> 00:09:22,354
One, two, three.
Testing, testing.

101
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,822
It'll do his image a world of good.

102
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,515
The president will act...

103
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:31,784
- Of course I will...
- General?

104
00:09:31,856 --> 00:09:33,482
No, not now.

105
00:09:33,557 --> 00:09:35,489
Just come up here for a minute.

106
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:43,456
Are you gonna leave the U.N. Or not?

107
00:09:43,526 --> 00:09:47,458
Korea respect Sukarno.
Not like...

108
00:09:47,526 --> 00:09:51,653
Let me put it this way. If you
don't leave, what are you gonna do?

109
00:09:51,727 --> 00:09:53,659
Can I come to your place?

110
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,927
If you leave the U.N.,
what are you gonna do?

111
00:09:56,995 --> 00:10:01,360
In short, Jakarta is a city where
the questions outnumber the answers...

112
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:03,122
but one thing is certain:

113
00:10:03,195 --> 00:10:06,923
That Sukarno's tightrope shuffle
between the Communist P.K. I...

114
00:10:06,996 --> 00:10:08,690
and the right-wing military...

115
00:10:08,763 --> 00:10:13,128
is looking more precarious
as the hours tick by.

116
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:17,130
This is Guy Hamilton
in Jakarta for A.B.S. News.

117
00:10:17,198 --> 00:10:19,721
- Is that all?
- What do you mean?

118
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:24,022
- You could have written that from here.
- What about the tightrope image?

119
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:26,759
Everyone else thinks Sukarno
is in control.

120
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:30,095
Guy, that wasn't news.
It was travelogue.

121
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:31,531
Sydney out.

122
00:10:43,202 --> 00:10:45,361
- Didn't like it, eh, boss?
- Stop callin' me boss.

123
00:10:48,503 --> 00:10:50,093
Sorry.

124
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,636
Have one of these.

125
00:11:56,014 --> 00:11:59,277
- Why are you creepin' around?
- I'm sorry. I didn't hear you come in.

126
00:11:59,348 --> 00:12:01,075
- Geez.
- I keep equipment here.

127
00:12:01,148 --> 00:12:04,410
Potter gave me a key.
Do you want it back?

128
00:12:05,216 --> 00:12:07,273
Huh! Keep it.

129
00:12:11,217 --> 00:12:13,206
- Did you get an interview today?
- What?

130
00:12:13,284 --> 00:12:16,216
- Did you get an interview?
- No, I didn't.

131
00:12:18,018 --> 00:12:19,950
You're in trouble.
Do you realize that?

132
00:12:20,018 --> 00:12:21,279
It's early days yet.

133
00:12:21,351 --> 00:12:24,341
All the top doors are shut
to Western journalists.

134
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:27,351
- Curtis got an interview.
- Curtis and Wally have got reputations.

135
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:31,045
They can't be ignored.
Your only way in is personal contacts.

136
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,552
Potter sabotaged you.

137
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:35,746
You want me to shoot myself?

138
00:12:43,122 --> 00:12:46,055
Ten years I've waited for this,
and if I mess it up...

139
00:12:46,123 --> 00:12:49,112
they'll send me back to the news room
in Sydney, and that's a graveyard.

140
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,786
If you could get
any interview you want...

141
00:12:55,857 --> 00:12:58,551
excluding one with Sukarno,
who would it be?

142
00:12:59,624 --> 00:13:02,591
- The leader of the Communist Party.
- I'll get it.

143
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:04,784
I can get you to him tomorrow.

144
00:13:05,859 --> 00:13:08,724
- He doesn't give interviews.
- He does when he needs to.

145
00:13:08,793 --> 00:13:11,782
He's a friend of mine.
I've already spoken to him about you.

146
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,759
- Why are you on speaking terms with...
- lf you want it...

147
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:17,226
it's yours.

148
00:13:17,295 --> 00:13:19,488
It should make quite a stir
internationally.

149
00:13:21,295 --> 00:13:24,456
If you can get me to Aidit, I'll give
you all the film work you can handle.

150
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:25,790
Exclusive.

151
00:13:27,696 --> 00:13:31,151
That's great, old man. That's what
I've always wanted, a real partnership.

152
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:35,091
Why the break to me?
Why not Potter?

153
00:13:36,897 --> 00:13:38,329
I didn't like him.

154
00:13:41,232 --> 00:13:43,164
We'll make a great team.

155
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:47,494
You, for the words;
me, for the pictures.

156
00:13:47,566 --> 00:13:49,226
I can be your eyes.

157
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,826
- Thank you very much, Mr. Aidit.
- Let's go, Guy!

158
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,332
We'll keep in touch!

159
00:13:58,835 --> 00:14:00,767
I'll take this straight
to the airport.

160
00:14:00,835 --> 00:14:03,768
- You'll be rushing to catch the flight.
- I'll make it.

161
00:14:04,836 --> 00:14:07,200
If you shot that out of focus,
I'll kill you.

162
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:09,462
You worry about the words,
Hamilton.

163
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:14,631
Identification: Guy Hamilton
in Jakarta. Lead-in for story.

164
00:14:15,537 --> 00:14:19,231
Exclusive interview with head
of the Indonesian Communist Party.

165
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:21,430
Piece begins in five seconds.

166
00:14:22,538 --> 00:14:25,471
"Sukarno has yielded to the
demands of Communist Party members...

167
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:28,300
"in Indonesian cabinet that
a 'Fifth Force' is to be established."

168
00:14:28,372 --> 00:14:30,702
- That's bullshit!
- The worrying thing is...

169
00:14:30,773 --> 00:14:33,672
it's well-written bullshit,
and it's right here in my paper.

170
00:14:33,741 --> 00:14:36,139
My paper wants me to match it.

171
00:14:38,508 --> 00:14:41,770
Here they are now.
Sir Guy and the Black Dwarf.

172
00:14:41,842 --> 00:14:43,536
Congratulations, Hamilton.

173
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:45,871
You've squeezed the test match
into two columns.

174
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,641
Sorry about that.

175
00:14:51,577 --> 00:14:52,770
- Want a beer?
- Great.

176
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:55,105
Ali!

177
00:14:58,711 --> 00:15:01,610
You really think Sukarno's gonna let
the Commies have their own army?

178
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:03,611
- That's what Aidit said.
- Aidit's lying.

179
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,440
- Maybe.
- Why report it?

180
00:15:05,512 --> 00:15:08,308
- Maybe he isn't.
- You know why he let you interview him?

181
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:09,936
No. Tell us, Pete.

182
00:15:10,013 --> 00:15:12,843
Because he knew a more experienced
journalist wouldn't have even filed it.

183
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:14,243
Really, Pete?

184
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,837
If Aidit told you he had a toothache,
you'd file it.

185
00:15:16,914 --> 00:15:20,312
You've been after him for months
trying to get him to tell you something.

186
00:15:20,381 --> 00:15:24,144
The story stinks, and you know it.
Sukarno's not stupid.

187
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:26,648
He lets the Communists have arms, and
we'll have a civil war here tomorrow.

188
00:15:26,716 --> 00:15:28,648
- Yeah, that's right.
- There better not be.

189
00:15:28,716 --> 00:15:32,843
- I'm gettin' married in December.
- Don't lose any sleep over it.

190
00:15:32,917 --> 00:15:35,315
This story's bullshit,
and when I file...

191
00:15:35,384 --> 00:15:37,748
I'm gonna piss on it
from a great height, mate.

192
00:15:37,817 --> 00:15:40,011
You do that, buddy.
It's about the only...

193
00:15:41,152 --> 00:15:43,618
- Guy! No!
- Simmer down! Stop it!

194
00:15:43,686 --> 00:15:45,584
- Did you see that?
- Forget it.

195
00:15:45,652 --> 00:15:47,584
Next time, pal.

196
00:15:48,553 --> 00:15:50,018
Jesus!

197
00:15:50,086 --> 00:15:52,019
I must confess, Hamilton...

198
00:15:52,087 --> 00:15:55,985
that I probably would have infused it
with a little more skepticism...

199
00:15:56,054 --> 00:15:59,249
but bitter resentment won't prevent me
from admitting it was a good piece.

200
00:15:59,322 --> 00:16:02,015
Well done.
Now smile and shake hands.

201
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,114
Beauty among the squalor.

202
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:19,282
I took that with a 200 millimeter.
Got a natural elegance, haven't they?

203
00:16:20,992 --> 00:16:23,220
All I ever see you shoot are tits.

204
00:16:24,426 --> 00:16:27,017
Quit trying to sell us
the pursuit of abstract beauty...

205
00:16:27,092 --> 00:16:29,025
and admit you're a pervert.

206
00:16:29,093 --> 00:16:32,582
Billy, you're a professional.
Is that pornography or art?

207
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,423
If it's in focus, it's pornography.
If it's out of focus, it's art.

208
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,256
Definitely art. Mmm.

209
00:16:38,328 --> 00:16:40,692
They really are
exquisite creatures, aren't they?

210
00:16:40,762 --> 00:16:44,286
Let me ask you something. I've
worried about this since you got here.

211
00:16:44,362 --> 00:16:47,329
- What do you do for sex?
- You're worried about that?

212
00:16:47,396 --> 00:16:49,157
Whenever I hit the front page,
I get a hard-on.

213
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:52,424
- So what do you do?
- I go up to the cemetery.

214
00:16:52,497 --> 00:16:54,157
Are you a necrophiliac?

215
00:16:55,564 --> 00:16:57,120
It's where the prostitutes hang out.

216
00:16:57,197 --> 00:16:58,663
Fantastic girls, Hamilton.

217
00:16:58,731 --> 00:17:01,129
Best value-for-your-money ass
in Asia.

218
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:03,323
I'll take you up there
right now, huh?

219
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:05,058
- Some other time.
- Wise man.

220
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:07,928
- They're riddled with VD.
- You never heard of penicillin?

221
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:10,193
You will love this action.

222
00:17:10,266 --> 00:17:12,495
You want to spend the night?
Costs you one dollar.

223
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:14,795
Starvation's a great aphrodisiac.

224
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:18,766
Keep it up, Billy. We'll just
nail you to the old cross, huh?

225
00:17:20,168 --> 00:17:21,930
He can afford to be virtuous.

226
00:17:22,002 --> 00:17:24,900
He's holding hands
with the best-lookin' chick in town.

227
00:17:24,969 --> 00:17:26,458
She's a friend.

228
00:17:26,536 --> 00:17:28,559
Sure she is, Billy.

229
00:17:28,636 --> 00:17:31,501
You'd find that kind of relationship
hard to understand.

230
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,035
Get me the nails.

231
00:17:33,103 --> 00:17:35,763
I'm gonna hang the little bastard up
right now.

232
00:17:35,837 --> 00:17:38,395
You've been holdin' out on me.

233
00:17:38,471 --> 00:17:40,266
Here we are. Come on.

234
00:17:41,205 --> 00:17:43,228
Not too much, Hamilton.
Take it easy.

235
00:17:45,405 --> 00:17:47,701
All right. That's enough.

236
00:17:47,773 --> 00:17:51,729
Hey, Billy, grab one of these.
Go on! Go on.

237
00:17:51,807 --> 00:17:54,602
Come on. Out of the way.
We're trying to eat here.

238
00:17:56,274 --> 00:17:58,331
You ever have these?
This stuff is terrific.

239
00:17:59,908 --> 00:18:01,999
I want you to meet your new best friend.
I bought him for you.

240
00:18:04,242 --> 00:18:05,572
Dance for my pal.

241
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:08,876
- Do a dance for my pal.
- Okay.

242
00:18:19,545 --> 00:18:23,137
- Get him outta here.
- I bought him for you, pal.

243
00:18:31,547 --> 00:18:33,638
He's yours.
He goes wherever you go.

244
00:18:43,516 --> 00:18:45,072
Oh, God.

245
00:18:50,316 --> 00:18:53,112
- It was just a joke.
- Just a joke.

246
00:18:53,184 --> 00:18:55,116
- Hey, Wally...
- Forget it.

247
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:57,707
- Sorry.
- Billy, it was a joke.

248
00:18:59,918 --> 00:19:01,475
Forget it.

249
00:19:05,286 --> 00:19:07,218
Billy, what's that weird noise?

250
00:19:07,286 --> 00:19:10,548
It's the bamboo,
but there is a spirit here.

251
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,643
I hear him outside at night.

252
00:19:13,754 --> 00:19:17,516
He came inside one night and spilled
some bottles of developer.

253
00:19:17,587 --> 00:19:20,645
- Do you really believe that stuff?
- Absolutely, old man.

254
00:19:20,722 --> 00:19:22,654
The unseen is all around us...

255
00:19:22,722 --> 00:19:24,881
particularly here in Java.

256
00:19:31,457 --> 00:19:32,650
G'day, sport.

257
00:19:32,724 --> 00:19:33,781
G'day.

258
00:19:33,857 --> 00:19:35,789
One of us.

259
00:19:40,658 --> 00:19:43,852
Air-conditioning, huh? I thought you
were living like the people.

260
00:19:43,925 --> 00:19:46,949
I keep a lot of film stock here.
It's kinder to it.

261
00:19:47,026 --> 00:19:48,356
Kinder to you too, eh?

262
00:19:48,426 --> 00:19:53,484
Okay, okay. But everything else here
is your basic Indonesia.

263
00:20:00,328 --> 00:20:03,522
A normal man
of normal intelligence...

264
00:20:03,595 --> 00:20:05,584
capable of having
normal children...

265
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,458
but whose body is a joke.

266
00:20:09,196 --> 00:20:11,322
But the one great advantage
of being a dwarf...

267
00:20:11,397 --> 00:20:14,693
is that you can be wiser than
other people and no one envies you.

268
00:20:15,831 --> 00:20:17,421
You're not a dwarf.

269
00:20:19,031 --> 00:20:20,964
That's what I like
about you, Guy.

270
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:25,693
You don't care, do you?

271
00:20:27,065 --> 00:20:29,055
Or maybe you just don't see.

272
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,192
- Want some tea?
- Love some.

273
00:20:58,638 --> 00:21:00,104
This picture of Sukarno...

274
00:21:00,172 --> 00:21:02,104
- It's me.
- It's you. Yeah.

275
00:21:02,172 --> 00:21:03,638
I dressed for the part.

276
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,631
He's quite a hero of mine.
I think he's a genius.

277
00:21:09,907 --> 00:21:12,771
He's really trying to do
something for his people.

278
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,500
To them, he's a god.

279
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:25,633
That's the real Jakarta.

280
00:21:27,042 --> 00:21:30,634
Scrounging for handfuls of rice
to keep alive another day.

281
00:21:30,709 --> 00:21:34,199
That's a story you journos
don't tell in your reports.

282
00:21:34,277 --> 00:21:37,005
- Nobody wants to hear it.
- Tell them anyway.

283
00:21:39,978 --> 00:21:42,069
Why don't you exhibit these?

284
00:21:42,145 --> 00:21:45,077
I don't care about the photographs.
I care about the content.

285
00:21:45,145 --> 00:21:47,112
I'm not very aesthetically minded.

286
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,305
That explains all those
terrible shirts you get around in.

287
00:21:56,047 --> 00:21:57,479
You like my puppets?

288
00:21:57,548 --> 00:21:59,514
If you want to understand Java...

289
00:21:59,581 --> 00:22:01,877
you have to understand
the wajang...

290
00:22:01,948 --> 00:22:03,539
the sacred shadow play.

291
00:22:03,615 --> 00:22:05,547
The puppet master was a priest.

292
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,104
That's why they call Sukarno
the great puppet master...

293
00:22:08,183 --> 00:22:10,706
balancing the left
with the right.

294
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:17,309
Their shadows are souls,
and the screen is heaven.

295
00:22:17,385 --> 00:22:19,442
You must watch their shadows...

296
00:22:19,518 --> 00:22:21,313
not the puppets.

297
00:22:21,385 --> 00:22:25,341
The right in constant struggle
with the left.

298
00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:28,943
The forces of light and darkness
in endless balance.

299
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,850
In the West, we want answers
for everything.

300
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,183
Everything is right or wrong
or good or bad.

301
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:39,414
But in the wajang, no such
final conclusions exist.

302
00:22:40,888 --> 00:22:42,582
Look at Prince Arjuna.

303
00:22:44,088 --> 00:22:45,520
He's a hero.

304
00:22:46,689 --> 00:22:50,019
But he can also be fickle
and selfish.

305
00:22:50,089 --> 00:22:52,453
Krishna says to him...

306
00:22:52,523 --> 00:22:56,388
"All is clouded
by desire, Arjuna...

307
00:22:56,457 --> 00:22:58,787
"as a fire by smoke...

308
00:22:58,858 --> 00:23:01,256
"as a mirror by dust.

309
00:23:01,325 --> 00:23:04,780
"Through these,
it blinds the soul."

310
00:23:05,692 --> 00:23:07,522
Pretty good stuff.

311
00:23:09,026 --> 00:23:12,221
This is the Princess Srikandi.

312
00:23:12,294 --> 00:23:15,920
Noble and proud but headstrong.

313
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:18,290
Arjuna will fall in love with her.

314
00:23:21,395 --> 00:23:22,952
Who's this one?

315
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,461
He's very special.

316
00:23:27,362 --> 00:23:29,521
The dwarf, Semar.

317
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,496
What does he do?

318
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,821
He serves the prince.

319
00:23:42,898 --> 00:23:44,421
That's my Jilly.

320
00:23:49,033 --> 00:23:51,226
There's someone
you should get to know.

321
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,028
- Who?
- The chap with the mustache.

322
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,691
He's British military attaché.

323
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:59,100
- Colonel.
- Ah, Kwan.

324
00:23:59,168 --> 00:24:00,758
This is Guy Hamilton from A.B.S.

325
00:24:00,835 --> 00:24:02,461
- Colonel Ralph Henderson.
- How are you?

326
00:24:02,535 --> 00:24:04,694
Been listening to your broadcasts.

327
00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:06,792
- More interesting than your predecessor.
- Thank you.

328
00:24:06,869 --> 00:24:07,960
Jilly.

329
00:24:08,036 --> 00:24:10,003
Billy, what are you doing here?

330
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:13,093
- You never come to the pool.
- I brought someone to meet you.

331
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:15,261
- Really?
- I knew I'd find you here.

332
00:24:18,138 --> 00:24:21,468
This is my special friend,
Jilly Bryant. Guy Hamilton.

333
00:24:22,672 --> 00:24:25,195
- Drinks all around?
- Yes, please.

334
00:24:25,272 --> 00:24:27,795
Gin and tonics for everyone?

335
00:24:27,873 --> 00:24:29,463
- Four.
- Yes, sir.

336
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:32,199
You're staying at the hotel?
You're lucky. It's delightful.

337
00:24:32,273 --> 00:24:35,569
We're at the ambassador's residence
since the locals destroyed our embassy.

338
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,664
- I hear they tore the place apart.
- Yes, they seemed to have fun.

339
00:24:38,741 --> 00:24:41,798
- It was all rather droll.
- It was anything but droll.

340
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:44,535
Didn't some clown keep playing
the bagpipes the whole time?

341
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:46,802
That was Ralph.

342
00:24:48,543 --> 00:24:50,406
It helped the morale.

343
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,942
I bet you're counting
the days now, Jilly.

344
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:58,272
- Oh, three weeks.
- 'Til what?

345
00:24:58,344 --> 00:25:00,106
- 'Til I go home.
- Where's that?

346
00:25:00,178 --> 00:25:02,906
- London.
- Had enough of the tropics?

347
00:25:02,979 --> 00:25:05,911
I've been on the move five years.
I'd like to go someplace and stay.

348
00:25:10,646 --> 00:25:12,237
Oh, here are the drinks.

349
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,076
- What's this?
- Gin and tonic, sir.

350
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:20,080
- Gin, tonic and ice.
- Gin and tonic always with ice, sir.

351
00:25:20,148 --> 00:25:22,239
Gin and tonic
does not always have ice.

352
00:25:22,315 --> 00:25:24,214
- Americans always use ice.
- Ralph.

353
00:25:24,282 --> 00:25:26,077
- Get me another.
- I'll take it.

354
00:25:38,051 --> 00:25:40,517
- Who's for a swim?
- Not me.

355
00:25:40,585 --> 00:25:43,017
I promised myself
an afternoon of laziness.

356
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:46,245
- How about you, Jilly?
- No. I've only just come out.

357
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:48,286
- Come in again.
- No.

358
00:25:48,353 --> 00:25:50,319
Stay here. Keep Billy company.

359
00:25:51,653 --> 00:25:54,847
- Hamilton, I'll give you a race.
- A race?

360
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,079
You Australians are supposed to be
able to swim, aren't you?

361
00:25:57,154 --> 00:26:00,553
I hope you're fit.
When Ralph says race, he means it.

362
00:26:00,621 --> 00:26:02,588
There's no sense being halfhearted.

363
00:26:02,655 --> 00:26:05,519
Games are a serious business
with the English. Right, Colonel?

364
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:07,112
They have their place.

365
00:26:08,756 --> 00:26:11,745
- Come on, Hamilton.
- Is he serious?

366
00:26:11,823 --> 00:26:13,221
All right.

367
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,756
Wish me luck.

368
00:26:21,558 --> 00:26:22,990
What do you think?

369
00:26:23,892 --> 00:26:25,915
- About what?
- Hamilton.

370
00:26:25,992 --> 00:26:27,925
Oh. Cheeky.

371
00:26:38,895 --> 00:26:40,827
Come on, Colonel.
Keep pace.

372
00:26:40,895 --> 00:26:43,555
- Paddle!
- Come on, Ralph!

373
00:26:43,629 --> 00:26:45,390
Don't turn back now.

374
00:26:45,462 --> 00:26:47,985
Up the A.B.S., Hamilton!

375
00:26:49,797 --> 00:26:51,353
Go, go, go.

376
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:55,322
Well done, Ralph.

377
00:26:55,397 --> 00:26:57,420
The nearest anyone's
come to beating him.

378
00:26:57,497 --> 00:27:00,555
- He had you worried, didn't he, Colonel?
- Indeed he did.

379
00:27:00,631 --> 00:27:02,063
Congratulations.

380
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:07,492
I find we have
something else in common.

381
00:27:08,566 --> 00:27:11,032
We are divided men.

382
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,566
Your father, American;
mine, Chinese.

383
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:17,566
We're not really certain
we're Australian, you and I.

384
00:27:19,201 --> 00:27:21,531
We're not quite at home
in the world.

385
00:27:47,273 --> 00:27:49,136
Oh, thanks.

386
00:27:49,206 --> 00:27:50,467
Tiger Lily?

387
00:27:51,373 --> 00:27:53,363
What's the matter with him?

388
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,305
He's having troubles
with the military.

389
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:57,863
What sort of trouble?

390
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:02,231
His father has a small shop.

391
00:28:02,308 --> 00:28:04,206
Each week the military comes
to ask for money.

392
00:28:04,275 --> 00:28:06,707
He has no more money,
and he's afraid.

393
00:28:13,843 --> 00:28:16,072
No, boss. I'm not
looking for handouts.

394
00:28:16,144 --> 00:28:18,110
I get more than that each week...

395
00:28:18,178 --> 00:28:19,905
exchanging dollars
on the black market.

396
00:28:20,812 --> 00:28:22,801
Don't be stupid, Kumar.
Keep the dough.

397
00:28:30,846 --> 00:28:33,005
For my father,
I'll play the beggar.

398
00:28:34,647 --> 00:28:36,670
- American embassy.
- Who is it?

399
00:28:36,747 --> 00:28:38,179
P.K.I.

400
00:28:39,248 --> 00:28:41,476
- Got the Bell and Howell loaded?
- Chockablock.

401
00:28:41,548 --> 00:28:43,242
Any hairs on the lens?

402
00:28:43,315 --> 00:28:45,838
You worry about the words.
I'll take care of the pictures.

403
00:28:45,916 --> 00:28:49,076
See that you do.
Hey, you, come on. You're driving.

404
00:28:49,983 --> 00:28:52,449
Me... me driving?

405
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,242
Camera!

406
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:34,713
P.K.I. Demand complete break
with America.

407
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,688
They're getting pretty confident,
aren't they?

408
00:29:36,757 --> 00:29:38,223
They have a lot of support.

409
00:29:39,124 --> 00:29:40,249
Enough to take over?

410
00:29:41,325 --> 00:29:42,348
Perhaps.

411
00:29:49,826 --> 00:29:51,156
P.K.I.!

412
00:30:10,197 --> 00:30:11,288
Camera!

413
00:30:12,663 --> 00:30:14,960
At least they would
give us discipline.

414
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,020
Stalin had good discipline.

415
00:30:17,098 --> 00:30:19,223
He wiped out ten million.

416
00:30:21,231 --> 00:30:23,595
Hey, Hortono.
Take us up closer to the gates.

417
00:32:17,484 --> 00:32:20,110
- Christ, what do we do now?
- I think we get out.

418
00:32:24,219 --> 00:32:26,708
Better not, boss! Boss!

419
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:37,086
Up! Hamilton, get me up!

420
00:32:39,488 --> 00:32:41,387
You don't take no photo!

421
00:32:41,454 --> 00:32:43,250
- No photo!
- Foreign press!

422
00:32:43,322 --> 00:32:45,254
- Foreign press!
- Don't take no photo!

423
00:32:45,322 --> 00:32:46,811
Australian press!

424
00:32:47,722 --> 00:32:48,779
Get off him!

425
00:32:50,023 --> 00:32:51,353
Get back here!

426
00:32:53,523 --> 00:32:55,490
- Come on!
- Let go, you bastard!

427
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:56,648
Oh, shit!

428
00:32:58,025 --> 00:33:00,048
Get out!

429
00:33:04,825 --> 00:33:07,223
Get back!

430
00:33:07,293 --> 00:33:08,782
Bastards!

431
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,985
Shit! The bastard cut me!

432
00:33:18,861 --> 00:33:21,487
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Did you get the shot?

433
00:33:21,561 --> 00:33:22,891
Yes!

434
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,225
Is that all right?

435
00:33:32,297 --> 00:33:33,558
Yeah, fine.

436
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,720
What do you think of her?

437
00:33:39,831 --> 00:33:41,229
Who?

438
00:33:44,232 --> 00:33:45,664
Not my type.

439
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,664
Oh. Why's that?

440
00:33:49,266 --> 00:33:52,255
It's her attitude. You know how
the British can be so damn superior?

441
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:54,596
It's like the colonel
with his gin, tonic and ice.

442
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:57,498
- Jill is not like that at all.
- No?

443
00:33:57,567 --> 00:33:59,499
Who's that
in the photograph with her?

444
00:33:59,567 --> 00:34:03,261
Philippe. He's a French journalist.
He was working here for a while.

445
00:34:06,902 --> 00:34:09,801
- Were they, uh...
- Yeah, they were.

446
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:13,962
Then he got transferred. It's difficult
for a woman like Jilly here.

447
00:34:14,037 --> 00:34:15,401
Why?

448
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,096
Every guy she meets
wants to get her into bed.

449
00:34:18,171 --> 00:34:20,535
And it's your job
to keep 'em at bay?

450
00:34:23,205 --> 00:34:24,569
Sorry.

451
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,571
I asked her to marry me once.

452
00:34:28,306 --> 00:34:29,738
She turned me down.

453
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,240
What about the colonel?

454
00:34:38,308 --> 00:34:40,365
I don't know.
She's fond of him.

455
00:34:40,441 --> 00:34:42,669
You gotta watch that sort of thing
in the tropics.

456
00:34:42,741 --> 00:34:44,503
I'm gonna get you
a penicillin tablet.

457
00:34:45,575 --> 00:34:47,666
I guess I'll survive. Thanks.

458
00:35:00,045 --> 00:35:01,908
What is all this stuff?

459
00:35:10,246 --> 00:35:11,507
Thank you.

460
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:17,009
- Who you workin' for, Billy?
- For you.

461
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:19,411
- The Communists? The CIA?
- Stop it.

462
00:35:19,481 --> 00:35:21,413
Why do you keep a file on me?

463
00:35:21,481 --> 00:35:23,141
- I keep files on everybody.
- What for?

464
00:35:23,215 --> 00:35:24,408
That's my business.

465
00:35:24,482 --> 00:35:26,107
- Lf you're an operative...
- I'm not.

466
00:35:26,182 --> 00:35:27,978
How am I supposed to know that?

467
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:30,448
You're gonna have to trust me,
aren't you?

468
00:35:37,284 --> 00:35:38,580
We're friends, aren't we?

469
00:35:40,351 --> 00:35:42,943
We make a good team.
We even look alike.

470
00:35:44,285 --> 00:35:46,410
It's true.
It's been noticed.

471
00:35:46,485 --> 00:35:48,747
We got the same color eyes.

472
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,975
Here. Take one of these
every four hours.

473
00:36:07,089 --> 00:36:10,522
Here, on the quiet page,
I'm master...

474
00:36:10,589 --> 00:36:12,987
just as I'm master
in the darkroom...

475
00:36:13,057 --> 00:36:16,854
stirring my prints
in the magic developing bath.

476
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:20,482
I shuffle like cards
the lives I deal with.

477
00:36:20,558 --> 00:36:22,581
Their faces stare out at me.

478
00:36:22,658 --> 00:36:25,988
People who will become
other people.

479
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:29,992
People who will become old,
betray their dreams...

480
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:31,989
become ghosts.

481
00:38:53,717 --> 00:38:55,274
Ibu?

482
00:38:57,284 --> 00:39:00,080
Doctor. Ibu, doctor.

483
00:39:00,151 --> 00:39:01,742
You understand?

484
00:39:22,655 --> 00:39:24,712
Can't make her understand
that the canal...

485
00:39:24,788 --> 00:39:28,380
which she and Udin bathe in
and drink from carries disease.

486
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:32,914
In another country,
she would be a decent woman.

487
00:39:32,991 --> 00:39:36,287
Here she begs
and perhaps sells herself.

488
00:39:37,658 --> 00:39:40,954
Her tragedy is repeated
a million times in this city.

489
00:39:42,225 --> 00:39:44,157
"What then must we do?"

490
00:39:45,225 --> 00:39:49,988
"We must give with love to whomever
God has placed in our path."

491
00:39:52,393 --> 00:39:54,587
- What is it?
- What's the big occasion?

492
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,593
Gentlemen,
an important announcement.

493
00:39:57,661 --> 00:40:01,594
I have secured me
a portion of Indonesia.

494
00:40:01,662 --> 00:40:03,821
So have I. She's waiting
for me in my room.

495
00:40:03,895 --> 00:40:07,589
A beachhead of tranquility,
a private domain, a haven.

496
00:40:07,663 --> 00:40:10,458
I have taken me a bungalow.

497
00:40:10,529 --> 00:40:13,087
- What?
- A bungalow?

498
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:15,857
- What'd you do that for?
- Nobody lives here.

499
00:40:17,764 --> 00:40:20,094
Let's see how long you last in this...

500
00:40:35,301 --> 00:40:37,233
Where is your drink?
Come along.

501
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:47,926
Up!

502
00:40:48,003 --> 00:40:49,526
Who do I look like?

503
00:40:49,603 --> 00:40:51,933
A Chinese-Australian
in a pitji cap.

504
00:40:52,004 --> 00:40:53,697
That's right!

505
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:55,532
I'll say one thing for you.

506
00:40:55,604 --> 00:40:57,797
Anglo-Saxons are better...

507
00:40:57,871 --> 00:41:00,030
in the tropics!

508
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:04,067
Anglo-Saxons better in the tropics

509
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:06,332
Anglo-Saxons are better
in the tropics

510
00:41:10,506 --> 00:41:12,097
Let's hit it, baby.

511
00:41:43,811 --> 00:41:45,437
They were hollowed out.

512
00:41:59,748 --> 00:42:02,806
Hello, Peter.
Are you enjoying the party?

513
00:42:02,882 --> 00:42:06,280
- Mora... Merva...
- Moira. Moira.

514
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:16,578
I'd enjoy it a lot more if we
got outta here. What do you say?

515
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,878
- What?
- Hold this, will you, Pete?

516
00:42:18,951 --> 00:42:20,212
Thanks, mate.

517
00:42:22,818 --> 00:42:24,478
Cut a rug, Kevin.

518
00:42:28,086 --> 00:42:30,348
Wanna dance?
Come on. Let's dance.

519
00:42:52,556 --> 00:42:54,352
Oops! I'm sorry.

520
00:43:04,325 --> 00:43:08,053
Anglo-Saxons
are better in the tropics

521
00:43:08,126 --> 00:43:09,888
Anglo-Saxons...

522
00:43:14,527 --> 00:43:16,459
You spoil me, Hadji.

523
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:18,460
I would never do that.

524
00:43:43,132 --> 00:43:45,428
- Curfew time.
- Oh, no.

525
00:43:45,499 --> 00:43:47,624
Come on. One more.
Let's put a record on.

526
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,827
- Hello.
- Hello.

527
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,957
- Enjoying yourself?
- Let's see here.

528
00:43:56,034 --> 00:43:57,967
- Hmm. And you?
- Fine.

529
00:43:59,235 --> 00:44:01,201
- Do you know Sri?
- Yes. How do you do?

530
00:44:01,268 --> 00:44:03,632
Colonel Henderson,
this is Jill, uh, Bryant...

531
00:44:03,702 --> 00:44:04,827
and Billy Kwan.

532
00:44:04,902 --> 00:44:06,493
Heard your piece on Lombok.

533
00:44:06,569 --> 00:44:08,728
- Interesting.
- Interesting?

534
00:44:08,803 --> 00:44:12,531
Yes, you're still young enough
and brave enough to speculate.

535
00:44:14,404 --> 00:44:16,996
The Lombok famine
wasn't exactly speculation.

536
00:44:19,471 --> 00:44:20,903
I'll get my coat.

537
00:44:20,972 --> 00:44:23,938
Let me hear it, Jill.
What did you think?

538
00:44:24,005 --> 00:44:26,563
I found it
a bit melodramatic.

539
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:30,470
That's only my opinion.
My flatmate was moved to tears.

540
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:31,971
So there you are.

541
00:44:33,073 --> 00:44:35,733
What does it take
to move you to tears?

542
00:44:43,242 --> 00:44:44,868
- Curfew.
- Good night.

543
00:44:44,942 --> 00:44:46,202
Good night.

544
00:44:49,076 --> 00:44:51,634
Right, everyone. Curfew.

545
00:45:05,012 --> 00:45:06,602
So it begins.

546
00:45:11,713 --> 00:45:12,974
Jesus!

547
00:45:14,914 --> 00:45:16,345
- Put it back.
- But, boss...

548
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:18,347
I like the challenge.
Put it back.

549
00:45:30,583 --> 00:45:32,845
- Hello. Is Billy here?
- No, I'm sorry.

550
00:45:32,917 --> 00:45:35,008
He hasn't been in all day.

551
00:45:35,084 --> 00:45:38,050
- We were to meet here and go for lunch.
- Maybe he's on his way.

552
00:45:38,117 --> 00:45:39,606
Unless he's later than I am.

553
00:45:42,485 --> 00:45:44,974
You wanna stick around and wait for him?
You want a coffee?

554
00:45:45,052 --> 00:45:46,609
No, thank you.
I've interrupted you.

555
00:45:46,685 --> 00:45:49,151
I'm glad you did.
It's been a high-wastage day.

556
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,953
If Billy does come back...

557
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,850
tell him I've gone back
to the embassy.

558
00:45:58,921 --> 00:46:00,887
You got a car?

559
00:46:00,954 --> 00:46:03,512
- I'll take a taxi.
- I can give you a lift if you like.

560
00:46:03,588 --> 00:46:05,520
That's all right.
I can get a taxi.

561
00:46:05,588 --> 00:46:08,419
I really did wanna get hold
of Billy myself.

562
00:46:08,489 --> 00:46:10,648
Maybe we could drive over
to his place and wait there.

563
00:46:10,723 --> 00:46:12,189
He's bound to turn up.

564
00:46:14,357 --> 00:46:17,517
- I'll get my jacket.
- In back of the door.

565
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:20,182
Boss? Have you forgotten?
The circuit to Sydney.

566
00:46:20,258 --> 00:46:22,191
- What time?
- 2:00.

567
00:46:22,258 --> 00:46:24,225
The Subandrio piece.
It's not important. Cancel it.

568
00:46:24,292 --> 00:46:26,224
- What about Priok?
- Ah, Jesus.

569
00:46:26,292 --> 00:46:28,191
- You have to be there by 3:00.
- 4:00.

570
00:46:28,259 --> 00:46:30,623
- 3:00, boss.
- Okay, I'll make it.

571
00:46:30,692 --> 00:46:32,886
And stop callin' me boss, will you?

572
00:46:47,296 --> 00:46:50,319
I'm sorry if I offended you last night.
About your famine story?

573
00:46:50,396 --> 00:46:54,329
Oh, no. A bit of constructive
criticism never goes astray.

574
00:46:55,764 --> 00:46:58,559
What did you think
was melodramatic about it?

575
00:46:58,631 --> 00:47:00,688
- I did offend you.
- No, you didn't.

576
00:47:00,764 --> 00:47:02,754
- Yes, I did.
- It was a good piece.

577
00:47:02,832 --> 00:47:06,889
I know what you were talking about.
I was there for two months in Lombok.

578
00:47:06,965 --> 00:47:09,227
I thought there was
one reference too many to children...

579
00:47:09,299 --> 00:47:11,232
with gaunt rib cages
and dull, listless eyes.

580
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,630
- The rest of it was fine.
- You were there.

581
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,132
Rib cages and eyes
are the real thing, eh?

582
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,258
Perhaps you only needed
to mention it once.

583
00:48:12,876 --> 00:48:14,843
- They always do that.
- What?

584
00:48:16,044 --> 00:48:17,976
They wanna touch
your white skin.

585
00:48:21,411 --> 00:48:23,173
I'm curious about something.

586
00:48:23,245 --> 00:48:24,541
What's that?

587
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:27,077
Why did you let Ralph
win that swimming race?

588
00:48:27,145 --> 00:48:29,112
You're observant, aren't you?

589
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:31,738
- Why'd you do it?
- It seemed important to him.

590
00:48:31,813 --> 00:48:34,746
- Are you always that generous?
- Oh, no.

591
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,812
- So why?
- I don't know.

592
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,813
I guess he reminded me of my father.
Same bald head, mustache.

593
00:48:42,082 --> 00:48:45,173
- He was killed in the war.
- How'd you know that?

594
00:48:45,248 --> 00:48:47,510
- Billy told me.
- Billy told you.

595
00:48:51,249 --> 00:48:54,239
Billy? Anyone home?

596
00:49:10,453 --> 00:49:12,511
Was Philippe a good journalist?

597
00:49:13,986 --> 00:49:16,714
- One of the best.
- Where is he now?

598
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,048
Saigon.

599
00:49:19,121 --> 00:49:21,679
- Did Billy tell you?
- Yeah.

600
00:49:21,755 --> 00:49:23,744
You and he have become
quite a team.

601
00:49:24,822 --> 00:49:26,550
He thinks the world of you.

602
00:49:26,622 --> 00:49:28,611
God, I don't know why.

603
00:49:28,689 --> 00:49:32,622
- You're everything he'd like to be.
- He's a strange little guy, you know?

604
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:36,384
How does he get me an interview
with the top Communist in Indonesia?

605
00:49:37,524 --> 00:49:40,854
- You think he's an agent?
- Well, maybe.

606
00:49:40,925 --> 00:49:42,857
You don't know him very well.

607
00:49:42,925 --> 00:49:45,790
He's a cameraman.
How does he get such good contacts?

608
00:49:45,859 --> 00:49:47,449
I don't know.

609
00:49:47,525 --> 00:49:49,685
People trust him.

610
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,522
He breezes into every embassy reception
whether he's invited or not.

611
00:49:53,593 --> 00:49:56,253
No one can get up the courage
to ask him to leave.

612
00:49:57,394 --> 00:50:00,849
He's keeping a file on me. Why does he
do that if he's not an agent?

613
00:50:00,928 --> 00:50:03,486
- He keeps files on many people.
- What kind of people?

614
00:50:03,562 --> 00:50:04,994
People he cares about.

615
00:50:06,096 --> 00:50:08,528
- Has he told you about lbu?
- Who's that?

616
00:50:08,629 --> 00:50:10,720
A woman he's adopted
from the Kampong.

617
00:50:10,796 --> 00:50:12,285
Billy's got a woman?

618
00:50:12,363 --> 00:50:13,795
More than that.

619
00:50:16,397 --> 00:50:18,659
- That's not his kid, is it?
- No.

620
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:21,424
He gives them food
and money, that's all.

621
00:50:21,498 --> 00:50:22,930
The old boy.

622
00:50:25,032 --> 00:50:27,658
- Would you like a cup of tea?
- Better not.

623
00:50:27,732 --> 00:50:30,198
I got interviews to do at Priok.

624
00:50:30,266 --> 00:50:31,698
You wanna come?

625
00:50:31,767 --> 00:50:33,096
To Priok?

626
00:50:33,767 --> 00:50:35,824
You can keep an eye
on the melodrama.

627
00:51:00,271 --> 00:51:01,998
What do you do at the embassy?

628
00:51:02,071 --> 00:51:03,867
Apart from socializing.

629
00:51:03,939 --> 00:51:05,166
I work with Ralph.

630
00:51:05,239 --> 00:51:06,330
You a spy?

631
00:51:09,739 --> 00:51:11,228
You're a spook, aren't you?

632
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,704
If I were, I'd hardly
tell you, would I?

633
00:51:19,241 --> 00:51:21,571
What agency did Philippe work for?

634
00:51:24,975 --> 00:51:26,771
When did he go to Saigon?

635
00:51:28,809 --> 00:51:30,241
A long time ago.

636
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:32,742
Arrogant lot, aren't they?

637
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:33,935
- Who?
- The French.

638
00:51:35,844 --> 00:51:37,833
I find them absolutely charming.

639
00:51:57,247 --> 00:51:59,237
- Hey!
- Don't you love the tropics?

640
00:51:59,315 --> 00:52:01,543
Torrential. I got it.

641
00:52:01,615 --> 00:52:04,410
- Did you order these?
- I must have.

642
00:52:05,149 --> 00:52:07,138
Let's take 'em with us.

643
00:52:27,986 --> 00:52:29,451
Oh, God!

644
00:52:31,353 --> 00:52:33,376
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

645
00:52:34,453 --> 00:52:35,714
My hat!

646
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,085
What's this?

647
00:52:39,988 --> 00:52:41,544
It's green stuff.

648
00:52:41,621 --> 00:52:43,451
Green stuff usually has ice,
doesn't it?

649
00:52:44,689 --> 00:52:45,950
Get me another.

650
00:52:58,624 --> 00:53:00,056
Don't you have an interview?

651
00:53:08,626 --> 00:53:11,456
- Let's go to the interview.
- Looks better on you.

652
00:53:11,526 --> 00:53:13,890
Does it?
Maybe I should buy one.

653
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:16,222
- You can have this one cheap.
- Oh, really?

654
00:53:28,196 --> 00:53:30,661
- Well, look, I had a...
- When are you leaving?

655
00:53:30,729 --> 00:53:33,218
- Two weeks.
- What about dinner tonight?

656
00:53:33,296 --> 00:53:35,229
- No, I'm...
- Tomorrow night?

657
00:53:35,297 --> 00:53:36,694
I'm busy all week.

658
00:53:36,763 --> 00:53:38,252
Don't you ever eat?

659
00:53:38,331 --> 00:53:39,592
Good-bye.

660
00:53:42,298 --> 00:53:44,264
I just wanna
see you again, all right?

661
00:53:45,799 --> 00:53:49,630
I'm leaving so soon. What's the point
of complicating things now?

662
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:51,689
What's complicated about eating?

663
00:53:55,033 --> 00:53:57,158
Good-bye, for the second time.

664
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,666
Good-bye, beautiful.

665
00:54:03,668 --> 00:54:05,600
Watch out for the melodrama.

666
00:54:07,236 --> 00:54:09,225
- I'll call you.
- No, don't.

667
00:54:09,302 --> 00:54:11,064
I will.

668
00:54:40,407 --> 00:54:43,533
The situation, surviving on
a few handfuls of rice...

669
00:54:43,609 --> 00:54:47,064
on this famine-stricken island
of Lombok.

670
00:54:47,143 --> 00:54:49,836
But it's the faces
you can't forget.

671
00:54:49,909 --> 00:54:52,103
Like images
in a recurring nightmare...

672
00:54:52,177 --> 00:54:54,370
they just keep coming back.

673
00:54:54,444 --> 00:54:55,774
Haunted faces...

674
00:54:55,843 --> 00:54:59,674
staring blankly back from the windows
of tumbledown hovels...

675
00:54:59,744 --> 00:55:03,472
the hollow, lifeless eyes,
skin stretched tight across bones...

676
00:55:03,545 --> 00:55:08,308
hands outstretched,
dull, listless eyes imploring.

677
00:55:08,379 --> 00:55:10,777
I move as if in a dream...

678
00:55:10,846 --> 00:55:13,677
through the agony
that is famine.

679
00:55:13,747 --> 00:55:18,180
This is Guy Hamilton in Lombok
for A.B.S. Magazine.

680
00:55:19,748 --> 00:55:22,305
Hello? Hello?

681
00:55:24,948 --> 00:55:27,642
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Hamilton.

682
00:55:30,416 --> 00:55:32,905
She's out this evening.
Any message?

683
00:55:36,151 --> 00:55:38,117
I'll tell her you called.
Good night.

684
00:55:41,118 --> 00:55:42,379
Are you sure?

685
00:56:01,155 --> 00:56:02,587
Listen to this, Guy.

686
00:57:00,764 --> 00:57:04,788
Guy, I'm not gonna be here
for a few days.

687
00:57:04,865 --> 00:57:07,525
Use the bungalow.
Have some peace and quiet.

688
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:08,860
Sure.

689
00:57:18,667 --> 00:57:20,600
What are you grinning at,
you fox?

690
00:57:22,169 --> 00:57:23,464
These are good.

691
00:57:30,602 --> 00:57:33,262
Jilly, you've only got
ten days to go.

692
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:37,459
Ten days.

693
00:57:39,938 --> 00:57:41,370
Any regrets?

694
00:57:49,606 --> 00:57:50,663
None.

695
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:51,973
Her Britannic Majesty's Ambassador,
Sir Andrew Watt and Lady Watt...

696
00:57:51,973 --> 00:57:54,599
Her Britannic Majesty's Ambassador,
Sir Andrew Watt and Lady Watt...

697
00:57:54,673 --> 00:57:58,333
request the pleasure of the company
of G.S. Hamilton, Esquire.

698
00:58:02,842 --> 00:58:04,432
You going to this?

699
00:58:04,508 --> 00:58:05,838
You joking?

700
00:58:05,909 --> 00:58:07,341
You might learn something.

701
00:58:07,409 --> 00:58:09,739
I doubt it.
The British don't let much slip.

702
00:58:09,809 --> 00:58:12,798
Yes, they do. They're just more subtle.
You gotta listen harder.

703
00:58:12,876 --> 00:58:14,137
Come again?

704
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:18,143
Jill will be there.

705
00:58:44,215 --> 00:58:47,613
Ladies and gentlemen,
music from Henderson...

706
00:58:47,682 --> 00:58:49,046
oysters from Qantas.

707
00:59:14,086 --> 00:59:15,518
Ladies and gentlemen.

708
00:59:17,188 --> 00:59:19,347
Ladies and gentlemen,
could I remind those of you...

709
00:59:19,421 --> 00:59:22,683
driving back to Jakarta this evening,
the curfew hour approaches.

710
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:35,888
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

711
00:59:35,957 --> 00:59:37,287
Good night.

712
00:59:37,357 --> 00:59:39,585
Excuse me, sir.
It's terribly late.

713
00:59:39,658 --> 00:59:41,681
The ambassador's already
asked me to close up.

714
00:59:41,758 --> 00:59:43,815
- Good night.
- Good night.

715
01:00:19,331 --> 01:00:21,820
Good evening. Are you
enjoying yourself? I must apologize.

716
01:00:21,898 --> 01:00:24,728
I must speak to Miss Bryant.
It's about that interview.

717
01:00:27,532 --> 01:00:29,760
You don't answer my phone calls.

718
01:00:40,768 --> 01:00:43,234
- Let's go.
- I can't.

719
01:00:43,302 --> 01:00:44,825
So what?

720
01:00:44,902 --> 01:00:47,266
I can't leave with you.
Everyone in Jakarta...

721
01:00:52,037 --> 01:00:54,026
I'm leaving in less than a week.

722
01:01:06,372 --> 01:01:07,531
Good-bye.

723
01:01:19,107 --> 01:01:20,698
Start, you bastard.

724
01:01:22,241 --> 01:01:23,798
Shit!

725
01:01:29,343 --> 01:01:31,002
Not the Hotel Indonesia.

726
01:01:31,076 --> 01:01:32,337
All right?

727
01:01:41,511 --> 01:01:43,501
Jill! What the hell
are you doing?

728
01:01:44,312 --> 01:01:45,710
The curfew!

729
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:20,010
Damn it! A roadblock.

730
01:02:31,286 --> 01:02:33,218
Okay, get down.

731
01:04:02,668 --> 01:04:04,100
Good morning.

732
01:04:08,035 --> 01:04:10,195
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Jill.

733
01:04:21,538 --> 01:04:22,970
Ralph, I'm so sorry...

734
01:04:23,038 --> 01:04:24,470
So am I.

735
01:04:30,073 --> 01:04:32,130
I hope you know
what you're doing.

736
01:04:43,575 --> 01:04:44,973
Morning.

737
01:04:49,543 --> 01:04:51,168
Sorry I'm late.

738
01:04:55,644 --> 01:04:58,633
Bryant, Jillian Edith.

739
01:04:58,711 --> 01:05:04,440
Nationality: British.
Born: 1938, under the sign of Pisces.

740
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,909
I must be mad.

741
01:05:05,979 --> 01:05:09,605
Occupation:
Assistant to military attaché...

742
01:05:09,679 --> 01:05:12,510
British Embassy, Jakarta.

743
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:15,603
Former postings:
Brussels, Singapore.

744
01:05:16,914 --> 01:05:19,039
Little religious feeling...

745
01:05:19,114 --> 01:05:21,046
yet has a reverence for life.

746
01:05:21,948 --> 01:05:25,142
This is a spirit
like a wavering flame...

747
01:05:25,215 --> 01:05:28,375
which only needs care
to burn high.

748
01:05:28,449 --> 01:05:32,473
If this does not happen, she could
lapse into the promiscuity...

749
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:34,982
and bitterness
of the failed romantic.

750
01:05:48,586 --> 01:05:49,846
What's funny?

751
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,317
You're looking pooped, kid.

752
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:55,849
Good luck to you.
They're only jealous.

753
01:05:57,988 --> 01:06:00,715
I hear she really
turns it on, huh?

754
01:06:01,622 --> 01:06:02,986
That what you heard?

755
01:06:10,856 --> 01:06:12,845
You saw it.
The guy's a lunatic.

756
01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:16,222
I think our boy's in love.

757
01:06:20,458 --> 01:06:22,720
Okay, start her up.

758
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:31,159
Switch her off.

759
01:06:31,892 --> 01:06:33,051
Yes, sir.

760
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,021
Why London?

761
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:41,323
- Why are you transferrin' there?
- Why do you want to go to Saigon?

762
01:06:41,395 --> 01:06:43,691
It's the center of things.

763
01:06:43,762 --> 01:06:46,557
I'll be able to find out what's really
going on in the world...

764
01:06:46,629 --> 01:06:49,562
not have to read about it
in the yellow press like most people.

765
01:07:00,964 --> 01:07:02,396
Why don't you stay?

766
01:07:05,598 --> 01:07:07,030
Why should I?

767
01:07:08,532 --> 01:07:10,464
Hmm, Mr. Hamilton?

768
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:40,512
What is it?

769
01:08:46,715 --> 01:08:48,147
You're soaking.

770
01:08:55,983 --> 01:08:57,916
What is it? What's wrong?

771
01:10:12,463 --> 01:10:15,918
We got a coded message through
from Singapore this morning.

772
01:10:15,997 --> 01:10:19,623
A ship left Shanghai a few days ago
with arms for the P.K.I.

773
01:10:24,532 --> 01:10:25,793
Civil war.

774
01:10:26,365 --> 01:10:27,388
Yes.

775
01:10:29,166 --> 01:10:32,030
I'm not giving you some scoop.
I want you to save your life.

776
01:10:32,099 --> 01:10:34,224
- I know, but you can't expect...
- lf the P.K.I. Take over...

777
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:36,199
they'll slaughter
every European in Jakarta.

778
01:10:37,933 --> 01:10:39,627
I can get you out on a plane.

779
01:10:39,701 --> 01:10:41,894
- I'll talk to Ralph.
- No, Jill, I'm staying.

780
01:10:46,969 --> 01:10:49,367
Nothing will keep the Communists
and the Muslims apart now.

781
01:10:49,436 --> 01:10:50,868
Not even Sukarno.

782
01:10:58,804 --> 01:11:00,736
I wonder how they're
gonna get the stuff in.

783
01:11:03,138 --> 01:11:05,969
Probably a port up north.
Yeah, they'll come in up north.

784
01:11:07,072 --> 01:11:09,766
Under a false bill of lading.
Tennis rackets, toilet seats.

785
01:11:09,839 --> 01:11:11,135
You can't use this.

786
01:11:12,806 --> 01:11:14,773
Then you shouldn't have told me.

787
01:11:27,976 --> 01:11:30,204
Hello, Billy.
What are you doing here?

788
01:11:30,276 --> 01:11:32,367
Waiting for you.

789
01:11:32,443 --> 01:11:35,568
Should be more work for you soon.
I'm trackin' something down.

790
01:11:35,643 --> 01:11:38,303
- About an arms shipment?
- Jill told you.

791
01:11:39,811 --> 01:11:41,334
Getting nowhere on it.

792
01:11:41,411 --> 01:11:42,809
You shouldn't even be looking.

793
01:11:43,978 --> 01:11:45,137
Why not?

794
01:11:45,211 --> 01:11:47,677
She told you in confidence,
the same as she told me.

795
01:11:47,745 --> 01:11:50,473
If you break the story,
everyone will know it came from her.

796
01:11:50,546 --> 01:11:54,309
- I'll only run it with my own evidence.
- That should ease your conscience.

797
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:56,744
Everyone will still know
where it came from.

798
01:11:56,814 --> 01:11:59,541
I can't let a story
like that just lie.

799
01:11:59,614 --> 01:12:02,945
I'm not running any story until
I get independent confirmation.

800
01:12:03,014 --> 01:12:04,776
That's the best I can do.

801
01:12:04,848 --> 01:12:09,611
If the Communists have the slightest
idea what you're after, you're dead.

802
01:12:09,683 --> 01:12:12,911
When that arms shipment comes in,
this whole country blows up.

803
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:15,681
I'm talking to you.

804
01:12:17,084 --> 01:12:19,016
If I don't follow
something like this...

805
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:21,744
I might as well go
and grow watermelons!

806
01:12:21,818 --> 01:12:23,477
You have changed.

807
01:12:24,785 --> 01:12:26,843
You are capable of betrayal.

808
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:31,679
Is it possible
I was wrong about you?

809
01:12:32,753 --> 01:12:37,083
You abuse your position as journalist
and grow addicted to risk.

810
01:12:37,154 --> 01:12:40,587
You attempt to rule neat lines
around yourself...

811
01:12:40,654 --> 01:12:42,416
making a fetish of your career...

812
01:12:42,488 --> 01:12:44,886
and making all relationships
temporary...

813
01:12:44,955 --> 01:12:46,978
lest they disturb that career.

814
01:12:48,256 --> 01:12:51,086
Why can't you give yourself?

815
01:12:51,156 --> 01:12:53,180
Why can't you learn to love?

816
01:12:53,257 --> 01:12:56,690
A shipment that size does not come into
the country without somebody noticing.

817
01:12:56,757 --> 01:12:58,450
Perhaps there is no such shipment.

818
01:12:58,524 --> 01:13:00,956
No such shipment.

819
01:13:05,925 --> 01:13:08,915
- Come back in two days.
- Keep an eye peeled.

820
01:13:12,493 --> 01:13:14,652
Be careful who you talk to
about this matter.

821
01:13:14,727 --> 01:13:18,091
I'm not P.K.I.,
but I might have been.

822
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:35,222
- No luck, boss?
- Not a bloody thing.

823
01:14:34,907 --> 01:14:37,772
- Why are we stopped here?
- It's getting late.

824
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,773
- We'll have a rest and a swim.
- No, we got too much work to do.

825
01:14:40,841 --> 01:14:42,000
Tomorrow.

826
01:14:46,042 --> 01:14:47,507
What is this place?

827
01:14:47,575 --> 01:14:50,974
An old Dutch villa. Tiger Lily
is a friend. We stay here sometimes.

828
01:15:08,846 --> 01:15:09,834
Cheers.

829
01:15:39,517 --> 01:15:41,040
I'll see you after siesta.

830
01:15:42,718 --> 01:15:44,685
You are in old Java now, boss.

831
01:18:08,242 --> 01:18:09,833
You're P.K.I., aren't you?

832
01:18:23,178 --> 01:18:26,633
My country suffers under a great weight
of poverty and corruption.

833
01:18:28,212 --> 01:18:30,179
Is it wrong to want to change that?

834
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,012
When the killing starts,
are you gonna be part of it?

835
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:38,979
- Sometimes there's no other way.
- Yeah, sure, Kumar.

836
01:18:42,482 --> 01:18:44,311
You must not ask anymore
about the shipment.

837
01:18:45,915 --> 01:18:48,006
- You know when it's arriving?
- Maybe it's already here.

838
01:18:48,915 --> 01:18:51,541
- That's the confirmation I need.
- Listen to me!

839
01:18:51,616 --> 01:18:55,912
I am unimportant in the Party.
Even Tiger Lily's more highly placed.

840
01:18:57,050 --> 01:18:58,243
They have a death list.

841
01:18:59,351 --> 01:19:00,816
You are on it.

842
01:19:03,585 --> 01:19:05,017
Come on.

843
01:19:08,319 --> 01:19:09,785
For craps sake.

844
01:19:10,919 --> 01:19:12,283
Hello. Are you there?

845
01:19:12,353 --> 01:19:14,285
- Hello?
- I'm sorry.

846
01:19:14,353 --> 01:19:18,184
Miss Bryant is still unavailable.
May I take a message?

847
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:19,652
Shit!

848
01:19:37,424 --> 01:19:39,356
I got something to show you!

849
01:19:41,557 --> 01:19:46,490
Well, be-bop-a-lula
She's my baby

850
01:19:46,558 --> 01:19:48,956
Be-bob-a-lula
I don't mean maybe

851
01:19:49,025 --> 01:19:51,821
I got that bitch, baby.
Saigon. Huh?

852
01:19:51,893 --> 01:19:54,086
Be-bop-a-lula
She's my baby

853
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:55,921
I'll be blastin' gooks
and kickin' ass.

854
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:58,387
Want another shot?

855
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,721
Yeah.

856
01:20:03,762 --> 01:20:06,990
The thing is this. I don't want
any ill feelings about this.

857
01:20:07,062 --> 01:20:09,995
I know it's hard to squash
those pangs of envy...

858
01:20:10,063 --> 01:20:12,722
when you're sitting in the presence
of talent like mine.

859
01:20:12,796 --> 01:20:14,387
Think of it this way.

860
01:20:14,463 --> 01:20:17,429
If there weren't guys like me in
this business, what would you aspire to?

861
01:20:17,497 --> 01:20:19,396
I'm glad you're going
to Saigon, shithead.

862
01:20:19,464 --> 01:20:21,453
I know.
You told me that four times.

863
01:20:21,531 --> 01:20:24,464
You are gonna miss out on
the biggest story of your life.

864
01:20:24,532 --> 01:20:26,725
- Like what?
- Just wait and see.

865
01:20:26,799 --> 01:20:30,425
You terrify me.
I mean, there I am.

866
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:34,194
I'm waiting to announce that
China's entering the war. Right?

867
01:20:34,266 --> 01:20:35,823
Along comes young Hamilton.

868
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:38,992
Blows me out of the water
with an update on Sukarno's pile.

869
01:20:44,168 --> 01:20:47,158
You are pretty good.
You had me runnin' there.

870
01:20:53,803 --> 01:20:55,235
Check this out.

871
01:21:05,072 --> 01:21:06,662
Hey, yeah.
Misters, right.

872
01:21:06,738 --> 01:21:09,728
Hey, yeah.
Okay, you bevy of beauties.

873
01:21:09,806 --> 01:21:12,272
Come on, baby.

874
01:21:21,775 --> 01:21:24,469
Let me show you how it's done.

875
01:21:33,009 --> 01:21:34,566
No dance!

876
01:21:36,511 --> 01:21:38,409
You! Stop dance!

877
01:21:40,477 --> 01:21:42,000
- Take it easy.
- Out!

878
01:21:42,078 --> 01:21:44,271
We're on the way.
We're just leavin'.

879
01:21:44,345 --> 01:21:46,277
Good night, everybody.
We had a lot of laughs.

880
01:21:47,179 --> 01:21:48,236
Adiós.

881
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:55,535
- Is this reefer?
- No, it's a Mars bar.

882
01:21:57,647 --> 01:21:59,579
Get the windows up!
Lock the door!

883
01:22:02,281 --> 01:22:03,713
See anybody you like?

884
01:22:10,183 --> 01:22:12,172
Let's get a little light
on the subject.

885
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:14,045
Do you like her?

886
01:22:15,350 --> 01:22:16,577
She likes you!

887
01:22:16,650 --> 01:22:18,673
This is what you call "yellow fever."

888
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:20,683
Me do it.

889
01:22:20,751 --> 01:22:22,239
- Mister?
- Me cheap.

890
01:22:23,484 --> 01:22:25,348
I think I'm in love.

891
01:22:25,419 --> 01:22:27,681
I'm good, mister.

892
01:22:27,752 --> 01:22:31,344
- Me cheap.
- Oh, yeah, baby!

893
01:22:32,253 --> 01:22:33,446
Yes. Hey!

894
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,214
What are you doing?
What's the matter with you?

895
01:22:36,287 --> 01:22:37,776
- It's a meat market.
- Come on.

896
01:22:37,853 --> 01:22:40,082
- I'm goin'. Are you staying?
- I'm stayin'.

897
01:22:40,155 --> 01:22:41,711
- Okay. Get out.
- Take it easy.

898
01:22:41,788 --> 01:22:44,050
- Have a nice time.
- Yeah.

899
01:22:44,121 --> 01:22:46,246
Girls. Huh?

900
01:22:47,622 --> 01:22:49,680
It's your old pal, Pistol Pete.

901
01:23:00,291 --> 01:23:02,280
Yeah, yeah, okay.

902
01:23:06,459 --> 01:23:08,425
Sorry, Miss Bryant's
not available.

903
01:23:12,926 --> 01:23:14,187
Thanks.

904
01:26:31,726 --> 01:26:35,124
Billy, come over here.
Been looking everywhere for you.

905
01:26:35,194 --> 01:26:36,319
What is all this?

906
01:26:36,394 --> 01:26:38,053
Bulgarian Independence Day.

907
01:26:38,127 --> 01:26:40,923
Not a crucial day in modern history,
but Sukarno's coming...

908
01:26:40,994 --> 01:26:42,426
in a couple of hours.

909
01:26:42,495 --> 01:26:44,484
We think he'll use
the occasion for a speech.

910
01:26:44,562 --> 01:26:48,188
- I'm sure he will.
- Later. Right now we're celebrating.

911
01:26:48,262 --> 01:26:51,126
- What are you celebrating?
- Curtis got Saigon.

912
01:26:52,529 --> 01:26:55,291
Curtis got Saigon.

913
01:26:55,363 --> 01:26:58,125
Well, we must all drink to that.

914
01:26:58,198 --> 01:27:00,164
Don't give me this crap tonight.

915
01:27:00,231 --> 01:27:03,789
Wherever human misery is at its worst,
the press will be there in force.

916
01:27:03,865 --> 01:27:06,559
- To Saigon!
- Give me a break.

917
01:27:06,631 --> 01:27:09,223
People are out there fighting
in the streets for rice.

918
01:27:09,299 --> 01:27:11,663
I shot some footage.
Does anybody want it?

919
01:27:11,732 --> 01:27:13,289
It's a temporary shortage.

920
01:27:13,366 --> 01:27:16,298
Why don't you tell them
the true story, gentlemen?

921
01:27:16,366 --> 01:27:19,231
Why don't you tell them that Sukarno
makes empty speeches...

922
01:27:19,301 --> 01:27:21,995
and builds monuments to his vanity
while his people starve to death.

923
01:27:22,068 --> 01:27:24,261
Tell them that he says,
"Eat rats!"

924
01:27:24,335 --> 01:27:27,665
You were the one who told us
he was a great man.

925
01:27:27,735 --> 01:27:30,724
He was. That's why
his betrayal is so hideous.

926
01:27:30,802 --> 01:27:31,734
Steady on, Billy.

927
01:27:31,802 --> 01:27:33,666
I've never agreed with you...

928
01:27:33,736 --> 01:27:36,168
on just how much the people
mean to Sukarno.

929
01:27:36,237 --> 01:27:39,397
The only thing he wanted to do for
his people was to go to bed with them.

930
01:27:39,471 --> 01:27:41,165
The female ones, that is.

931
01:27:42,405 --> 01:27:47,065
You're right. He does use his people
as objects of pleasure, but so do you.

932
01:27:47,139 --> 01:27:49,264
Only you do it with boys!

933
01:27:50,473 --> 01:27:52,496
What did you say?
You little bastard!

934
01:27:54,973 --> 01:27:58,303
- They'll throw him out of the country!
- You're no better, you and your girls!

935
01:27:58,373 --> 01:27:59,805
Put him down!

936
01:28:12,676 --> 01:28:14,609
I'll have my bags packed tonight.

937
01:28:24,278 --> 01:28:26,335
I want to talk to you!

938
01:28:35,780 --> 01:28:37,474
Billy, stop!

939
01:28:37,547 --> 01:28:40,479
- What's the matter with you?
- What do you want?

940
01:28:46,281 --> 01:28:49,680
- You made the broadcast.
- I didn't source that back to Jill.

941
01:28:49,749 --> 01:28:52,738
- Doesn't matter. That's not the point.
- Yes, it is the point.

942
01:28:52,816 --> 01:28:55,873
When this thing breaks, it could change
the political shape of Southeast Asia.

943
01:28:55,950 --> 01:28:57,917
How far are my loyalties
to Jill supposed to go?

944
01:28:57,984 --> 01:29:01,075
I would have given up the world for her.
You won't give up one story.

945
01:29:01,151 --> 01:29:04,345
It's not just a story.
It's the bloody story.

946
01:29:04,418 --> 01:29:06,180
Can't you understand that?

947
01:29:06,252 --> 01:29:08,946
Don't you understand?
You've lost Jill.

948
01:29:09,018 --> 01:29:10,678
What have you told her?

949
01:29:10,752 --> 01:29:14,549
I gave her to you. I'm taking
her back. Do you understand?

950
01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:16,745
You gave her to me?

951
01:29:16,820 --> 01:29:18,343
For Christ's sake.

952
01:29:18,421 --> 01:29:20,182
You mad little bastard!

953
01:29:20,254 --> 01:29:24,187
You think you can control people's lives
just 'cause you got 'em in your files?

954
01:29:27,055 --> 01:29:31,045
I believed in you.
I thought you were a man of light.

955
01:29:31,122 --> 01:29:34,112
That's why I gave you those stories
you think are so important.

956
01:29:34,190 --> 01:29:36,418
I made you see things.

957
01:29:36,491 --> 01:29:38,753
I made you feel something
about what you write.

958
01:29:38,824 --> 01:29:41,790
I gave you my trust.
So did Jill.

959
01:29:44,024 --> 01:29:45,786
I created you.

960
01:30:40,534 --> 01:30:41,966
Oh, my God.

961
01:30:43,502 --> 01:30:45,331
My God.

962
01:30:45,401 --> 01:30:47,061
My God.

963
01:31:32,743 --> 01:31:34,675
What then must we do?

964
01:31:42,311 --> 01:31:44,470
What then must we do?

965
01:31:48,745 --> 01:31:50,336
What then...

966
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:54,510
must we do?

967
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:01,576
We must...

968
01:32:23,018 --> 01:32:24,143
Very nice.

969
01:32:24,218 --> 01:32:26,207
719, please.

970
01:32:27,785 --> 01:32:29,376
Room 719?

971
01:32:35,786 --> 01:32:37,150
Excuse me.

972
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:41,997
- I made the broadcast.
- Yes, I know.

973
01:33:42,064 --> 01:33:43,996
I got it confirmed
straight from the P.K.I.

974
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:45,826
I decided to tell you.

975
01:33:45,899 --> 01:33:47,888
You're a journalist.

976
01:34:03,468 --> 01:34:05,491
- Who is it?
- Mr. Davis, security check.

977
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:07,000
What's going on?

978
01:34:08,569 --> 01:34:10,501
You see the notice
on the door here?

979
01:35:32,550 --> 01:35:34,209
Hey, Guy! Come on!

980
01:36:27,258 --> 01:36:28,918
I didn't mean to frighten you.

981
01:36:30,026 --> 01:36:31,992
You shouldn't be here.
Security men are all over.

982
01:36:32,059 --> 01:36:34,389
I know. I don't
want them to get his files.

983
01:36:48,062 --> 01:36:50,324
He was murdered, wasn't he?

984
01:36:50,396 --> 01:36:51,987
Yeah.

985
01:36:52,063 --> 01:36:54,586
Over a banner, and Sukarno
didn't even see it.

986
01:37:12,033 --> 01:37:14,499
- Who took this?
- He did.

987
01:37:15,567 --> 01:37:19,557
Self-timer, outside that grotty little
restaurant he always used to drag me to.

988
01:37:20,434 --> 01:37:22,559
"Best food in Jakarta, old man."

989
01:37:24,569 --> 01:37:26,501
God, I loved him.

990
01:37:33,469 --> 01:37:34,560
When you leaving?

991
01:37:39,571 --> 01:37:41,333
Tomorrow.

992
01:37:41,404 --> 01:37:42,665
What time?

993
01:37:43,572 --> 01:37:45,231
2:00.

994
01:37:46,572 --> 01:37:49,232
I never wanted to hurt you
by running that story.

995
01:37:51,839 --> 01:37:53,771
I wanted to talk to you about it.

996
01:37:53,839 --> 01:37:55,703
I don't want to lose you.

997
01:38:06,576 --> 01:38:08,508
You go first. Back door.

998
01:38:08,576 --> 01:38:11,440
- What about you?
- I'll be right behind you. Go!

999
01:38:16,910 --> 01:38:19,274
Jill. I'll be on that plane.

1000
01:38:44,815 --> 01:38:47,077
What's going on?
I gotta get to the airport.

1001
01:38:54,483 --> 01:38:56,346
What is it?

1002
01:38:56,417 --> 01:38:57,883
What's going on?

1003
01:38:57,951 --> 01:38:59,974
Some people have
taken over government.

1004
01:39:00,051 --> 01:39:01,312
Troops have moved...

1005
01:39:01,384 --> 01:39:03,316
to the president's palace.

1006
01:39:10,186 --> 01:39:11,243
Let's go.

1007
01:39:13,819 --> 01:39:16,342
Broadcast say
we should not go out.

1008
01:39:16,420 --> 01:39:20,410
It's okay. They won't touch us.
Come on. Come on!

1009
01:39:37,524 --> 01:39:39,615
I think you better keep
the engine running, eh?

1010
01:39:47,892 --> 01:39:49,915
Press. Foreign press.

1011
01:39:49,992 --> 01:39:51,652
A.B.S. Press.

1012
01:39:54,527 --> 01:39:57,823
I don't understand you.
I want to go to the palace.

1013
01:40:45,635 --> 01:40:47,397
Take me to the airport.

1014
01:40:47,468 --> 01:40:49,492
Can't, boss. Roadblock.

1015
01:40:50,803 --> 01:40:53,564
- Take me to Billy Kwan's.
- Okay, boss.

1016
01:41:10,672 --> 01:41:14,696
The retina is detached.
You must lie very still.

1017
01:41:14,773 --> 01:41:17,534
- How long?
- A week, maybe. Ten days.

1018
01:41:17,607 --> 01:41:20,699
If you wish to save your eye,
you will lie still.

1019
01:41:22,041 --> 01:41:24,098
You have to bandage both eyes?

1020
01:41:24,175 --> 01:41:26,198
- I'll be helpless.
- I'm sorry.

1021
01:41:44,244 --> 01:41:46,335
Your eye will be better?

1022
01:41:47,478 --> 01:41:48,739
Maybe not.

1023
01:41:51,145 --> 01:41:53,805
Lucky still got one.

1024
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:00,646
But men might come soon, I think.

1025
01:42:02,681 --> 01:42:04,613
I must go home to family.

1026
01:42:06,349 --> 01:42:08,042
I'm sorry, boss.

1027
01:42:09,716 --> 01:42:11,273
Good-bye, Hortono.

1028
01:42:11,350 --> 01:42:12,781
Good-bye, boss.

1029
01:42:59,790 --> 01:43:02,052
Krishna says to him...

1030
01:43:02,124 --> 01:43:05,852
"All is clouded by desire, Arjuna...

1031
01:43:05,925 --> 01:43:10,756
"as a fire by smoke,
as a mirror by dust.

1032
01:43:10,826 --> 01:43:13,588
"Through these,
it blinds the soul."

1033
01:43:18,260 --> 01:43:19,692
Who is that?

1034
01:43:20,594 --> 01:43:22,583
Hortono? Who's that?

1035
01:43:22,661 --> 01:43:24,093
It's me, boss.

1036
01:43:25,795 --> 01:43:27,727
Have you been sent to kill me?

1037
01:43:28,829 --> 01:43:30,261
We have failed.

1038
01:43:34,097 --> 01:43:36,790
We have been overcome
by the Muslim generals.

1039
01:43:36,863 --> 01:43:39,056
What about Sukarno?

1040
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:41,688
He is finished. He will
become a puppet of the Right.

1041
01:43:41,764 --> 01:43:43,230
And you?

1042
01:43:43,298 --> 01:43:44,730
I'm a dead man.

1043
01:43:48,299 --> 01:43:50,231
I'm sorry about your eye.

1044
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:56,323
There should be a packet of cigarettes
on the table. Help yourself.

1045
01:44:01,834 --> 01:44:04,131
Still the good cigarettes, boss.

1046
01:44:14,436 --> 01:44:15,697
Thank you.

1047
01:44:20,804 --> 01:44:21,895
Tell me something.

1048
01:44:22,804 --> 01:44:23,929
Sure.

1049
01:44:24,005 --> 01:44:25,437
Am I a stupid man?

1050
01:44:28,972 --> 01:44:31,336
Then why should I live
like a poor man all my life...

1051
01:44:31,406 --> 01:44:33,395
when stupid people
in your country live well?

1052
01:44:34,306 --> 01:44:35,829
Good question.

1053
01:44:35,906 --> 01:44:37,929
- Then please answer it.
- I can't.

1054
01:44:38,007 --> 01:44:40,200
Then why do you condemn
those in my country...

1055
01:44:40,273 --> 01:44:42,206
who try to do something about it?

1056
01:44:48,476 --> 01:44:50,533
Mister Billy Kwan was right.

1057
01:44:50,609 --> 01:44:52,541
Westerners do not have
answers anymore.

1058
01:44:58,877 --> 01:45:00,275
Water from the moon.

1059
01:45:01,511 --> 01:45:02,875
What does that mean?

1060
01:45:02,945 --> 01:45:04,706
It's an old Javanese saying.

1061
01:45:05,778 --> 01:45:07,768
Means something
one cannot ever have.

1062
01:45:10,846 --> 01:45:12,107
What time is it?

1063
01:45:13,013 --> 01:45:14,070
Just past 1:00.

1064
01:45:15,613 --> 01:45:17,772
- The airport closed?
- Not yet...

1065
01:45:17,847 --> 01:45:20,905
but everything will close down
when the army proclaims martial law.

1066
01:45:23,447 --> 01:45:24,708
Drive me there.

1067
01:45:26,148 --> 01:45:28,512
They have roadblocked the city.

1068
01:45:28,582 --> 01:45:30,048
Never stopped us before.

1069
01:45:33,516 --> 01:45:34,948
They will arrest me.

1070
01:45:35,017 --> 01:45:38,006
You can wait here to die,
or you can drive me to the airport...

1071
01:45:38,083 --> 01:45:40,107
and then take the car
up into the hills.

1072
01:45:40,184 --> 01:45:42,809
Why do you have to leave now?

1073
01:45:42,884 --> 01:45:45,316
You can stay and write
all the stories you want.

1074
01:46:01,087 --> 01:46:03,212
I hope to catch a plane
is worth losing your eye.

1075
01:46:08,656 --> 01:46:11,088
Go around, Kumar. Go up.

1076
01:46:38,327 --> 01:46:42,919
Easy. Don't show them
anything, Kumar.

1077
01:46:42,994 --> 01:46:45,256
You go up to the...

1078
01:46:50,029 --> 01:46:51,962
Calmly. Calm.

1079
01:46:53,196 --> 01:46:55,458
Easy.

1080
01:47:06,298 --> 01:47:07,787
- What's he want?
- Papers.

1081
01:47:09,198 --> 01:47:10,994
Corporal, here's my papers.

1082
01:47:11,066 --> 01:47:14,328
Australian Broadcasting Service.
I'm a journalist. He's my assistant.

1083
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:16,263
We must go to the airport.

1084
01:47:42,204 --> 01:47:43,863
Thank you very much.

1085
01:48:15,910 --> 01:48:17,671
- I'm sorry...
- Don't worry.

1086
01:48:18,411 --> 01:48:20,400
We will win because
we believe in something.

1087
01:48:22,511 --> 01:48:24,068
- Good-bye.
- Think of me, Guy...

1088
01:48:24,145 --> 01:48:26,441
when you're sitting
in some nice cafe in Europe.

1089
01:48:26,512 --> 01:48:29,603
In my dreams, I'm always
sitting at the table...

1090
01:48:29,679 --> 01:48:31,441
by the footpath,
drinking coffee.

1091
01:48:33,579 --> 01:48:35,511
- Good luck.
- Now go.

1092
01:48:35,579 --> 01:48:37,478
Quickly!

1093
01:48:46,481 --> 01:48:48,573
- No!
- I got a ticket, asshole!

1094
01:48:54,150 --> 01:48:56,207
No bags. See? Okay?

1095
01:48:57,550 --> 01:49:00,983
Hey! Royal Netherlands.
You got it? Right.

1096
01:49:03,084 --> 01:49:05,074
Royal Netherlands, 2:00,
all right?

1097
01:49:36,357 --> 01:49:37,482
Thank you.

1098
01:49:40,624 --> 01:49:42,591
Hey, stop! You!

1099
01:49:45,725 --> 01:49:47,782
- What?
- You bring that here!

1100
01:50:02,094 --> 01:50:03,355
This is Guy Hamilton...

1101
01:50:03,428 --> 01:50:05,587
reporting from Jakarta,
where a coup attempt...

1102
01:50:05,661 --> 01:50:07,594
by the Communist P.K. I...
