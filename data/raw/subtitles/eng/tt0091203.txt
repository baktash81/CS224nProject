1
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:31,477
...and the Tonga Kid.

2
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,171
Their opponents, in the corner to my right,

3
00:02:35,195 --> 00:02:40,070
with a combined weight of 725 lbs,

4
00:02:40,477 --> 00:02:43,812
the toasts of the coasts

5
00:02:43,853 --> 00:02:46,895
from Brad Street, U.S.A., Atlanta, Georgia,

6
00:02:46,978 --> 00:02:50,436
the Fabulous Freebirds!

7
00:02:50,478 --> 00:02:51,687
Yeah!

8
00:03:57,687 --> 00:04:01,441
Yeah, right! You're gonna love it!

9
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,465
Kill him! Stomp on the son-of-a...

10
00:04:42,572 --> 00:04:45,986
Don't give them a chance!

11
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,870
Hey! Where are you going?

12
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,017
MacLeod!

13
00:06:02,232 --> 00:06:03,233
Fasil.

14
00:06:04,234 --> 00:06:05,235
Wait.

15
00:06:25,715 --> 00:06:27,047
All right.

16
00:11:32,982 --> 00:11:34,604
MacLeod!

17
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,872
May this year of our Lord 1536

18
00:11:53,293 --> 00:11:56,205
bring victory to the clan MacLeod!

19
00:11:56,626 --> 00:12:00,049
MacLeod! Victory to MacLeod!

20
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:19,399
- Are you scared, Connor?
- No, cousin Dougal, I'm not!

21
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:21,651
Don't talk nonsense, man!

22
00:12:22,071 --> 00:12:25,485
I peed my kilt the first
time I went into battle!

23
00:12:25,905 --> 00:12:29,739
Oh, aye. Angus pees his kilt all the time.

24
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:53,393
Connor! Connor!

25
00:12:54,897 --> 00:12:57,357
Connow, wait! Wait!

26
00:12:58,187 --> 00:13:00,690
Take these flowers and think of me.

27
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,736
Remember, you fight with God
on your side, Connor.

28
00:13:07,156 --> 00:13:11,120
A girl like that can wound a soldier
more than a Fraser's sword, my friend.

29
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,783
Wait! Angus, you and Dugal keep him
in one piece, do you hear?

30
00:13:14,203 --> 00:13:16,956
Aye, we all know which piece that is!

31
00:14:01,381 --> 00:14:05,084
- There is one called Connor among them.
- Aye.

32
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,223
Remember our agreement, Murdoch.

33
00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:16,896
The boy is mine.

34
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:19,649
It's begun.

35
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,191
Death to the MacLeods!

36
00:14:22,231 --> 00:14:25,109
Death to the Macleods!

37
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,735
Death to the Frazers!

38
00:14:57,687 --> 00:14:59,138
MacLeod!

39
00:15:15,244 --> 00:15:16,245
Come on!

40
00:15:16,576 --> 00:15:18,077
Macleod!

41
00:15:22,502 --> 00:15:24,123
Stay under!

42
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,126
Forgive me,

43
00:15:27,547 --> 00:15:29,218
my son.

44
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,341
Fight me, damn you!

45
00:15:32,762 --> 00:15:34,013
No, that's Connor MacLeod!

46
00:15:34,063 --> 00:15:34,984
Fight me, you cowards!

47
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,047
No, not him!

48
00:15:44,103 --> 00:15:45,685
Castrate the heathens!

49
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,937
Nobody will fight me!

50
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:50,570
They all run away.

51
00:15:51,611 --> 00:15:53,032
Here, laddie, stay by me.

52
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,201
Mother of God!

53
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,708
Fight me!

54
00:16:22,141 --> 00:16:23,603
No!

55
00:16:25,274 --> 00:16:26,315
Come on, quick!

56
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,608
There can be only one!

57
00:16:32,401 --> 00:16:33,733
Another time, MacLeod!

58
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:11,731
- Get out of the car!
- Put your hands on the hood!

59
00:17:14,614 --> 00:17:16,606
- Move!
- Okay!

60
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:23,042
- Watch it, freak! Just cool it! Watch him!
- Watch him, watch him!

61
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:26,379
Move! Come on, come on, come on! Move!

62
00:17:26,563 --> 00:17:29,048
Come on, come on!

63
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,252
Spread them! Spread them! Come on!

64
00:17:34,343 --> 00:17:35,925
See some ID, pal!

65
00:17:39,388 --> 00:17:44,804
Well, Mr. Nash!
Where were you going in such a hurry?

66
00:17:46,686 --> 00:17:48,808
Give me it! Give me it! Give me it!

67
00:17:55,154 --> 00:17:57,446
Don't move, pal.

68
00:17:57,867 --> 00:18:00,119
Don't even breathe.

69
00:18:47,997 --> 00:18:51,120
- It is over.
- No!

70
00:18:51,671 --> 00:18:55,875
Other men are dying this day.
I must attend them.

71
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,507
Quiet!

72
00:19:05,474 --> 00:19:06,976
He's a Highlander, by God!

73
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:11,310
The last thing to hear should not be
that of a wailing woman!

74
00:19:36,465 --> 00:19:38,297
Hey, come on. Let me through.

75
00:19:38,758 --> 00:19:43,893
Damn it, Frank. Forensics are supposed
to be notified the same time as homicide!

76
00:19:44,513 --> 00:19:45,554
Holy shit!

77
00:19:46,055 --> 00:19:49,018
- Yeah, this one came unassembled.
- Did you made an arrest?

78
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:54,563
No. We're questioning some guy named Nash.
Antique dealer down on Hudson Street.

79
00:19:55,024 --> 00:19:57,066
- Hello, Brenda.
- Hi, Walt.

80
00:19:58,027 --> 00:19:59,568
You look pretty, Brenda.

81
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,942
What do you think of the cause of death,
Lieutenant, huh?

82
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:06,365
Oh, Christ! You're a
barrel of laughs, Garfield.

83
00:20:06,746 --> 00:20:08,307
Get your hands off!

84
00:20:08,748 --> 00:20:11,410
Hey, cop! When are you going to explain?
This was my wife's, man!

85
00:20:11,831 --> 00:20:14,713
Hey, Walker, get me a cherry-cheese
Danish toast, please!

86
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:17,416
What did they say?
What time did he buy it?

87
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,208
Oh! About 10:00, 10:30.

88
00:20:19,258 --> 00:20:21,300
Whatever made the cut was razor sharp.

89
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,424
Get out! I told you, you get out of here
with these cameras!

90
00:20:25,574 --> 00:20:27,526
Frank! Frank!

91
00:20:27,596 --> 00:20:29,438
- Oh, my God!
- About two days ago, the telefax

92
00:20:29,508 --> 00:20:32,531
told that a guy was killed just like this
over in Jersey.

93
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:35,184
Yeah, but I figured what the hell,
that's Jersey!

94
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,736
Hey, coppers, I want to get out of here!

95
00:20:37,857 --> 00:20:40,279
Hey Frank, come here!

96
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,652
Oh, shit!

97
00:20:45,825 --> 00:20:48,287
Oh, baby, look at you!

98
00:20:49,328 --> 00:20:51,660
Garfield, cover that head.

99
00:20:57,376 --> 00:21:01,130
- What the hell have you got?
- A Toledo Salamanca.

100
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:05,754
- A what?
- A sword, Frank. A very rare sword.

101
00:21:06,806 --> 00:21:10,059
- Well, is it worth much?
- Only about a million bucks.

102
00:21:12,431 --> 00:21:16,765
Any antique dealer on Hudson Street
could tell you that.

103
00:21:18,721 --> 00:21:23,681
You can't keep me here, asshole!
I know my rights!

104
00:21:52,932 --> 00:21:55,935
Ever see this guy before, Nash?

105
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:59,318
The name's Vazilek. Polish national.

106
00:21:59,358 --> 00:22:02,561
Had his head chopped off
in New Jersey two nights ago.

107
00:22:02,982 --> 00:22:06,285
- You ever get over to New Jersey, Nash?
- Not if I can help it.

108
00:22:06,405 --> 00:22:10,369
- You talk funny, Nash. Where're you from?
- Lots of different places.

109
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:13,492
- You're an antique dealer, right?
- Mm-hm.

110
00:22:13,913 --> 00:22:16,125
Okay. What's that?

111
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,333
- A sword?
- Wise up, smart ass!

112
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:30,499
That's a Toledo Salamanca broadsword
worth about a million dollars.

113
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:31,550
So?

114
00:22:31,891 --> 00:22:34,353
- So, you want to hear a theory?
- Mm-hm.

115
00:22:34,403 --> 00:22:37,186
You went down that garage
to buy this sword from that guy.

116
00:22:37,226 --> 00:22:39,768
- What's his name?
- I don't know. You tell me.

117
00:22:40,189 --> 00:22:42,661
Okay. His name is Iman Fasil.

118
00:22:42,701 --> 00:22:44,813
You fought about the price
and cut off his head.

119
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,817
Want to hear another theory?

120
00:22:49,238 --> 00:22:53,112
This Fasil was so upset
about the lousy wrestling tonight,

121
00:22:53,532 --> 00:22:57,416
he went down to the garage and in a fit
of depression cut off his own head.

122
00:22:58,707 --> 00:23:00,539
That's not funny, Walt.

123
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,701
You a faggot, Nash?

124
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:05,504
Why Garfield?
You're cruising for a piece of ass?

125
00:23:07,756 --> 00:23:09,798
I'll tell you what happened, Russell.

126
00:23:10,219 --> 00:23:12,891
You went down to the garage for a blow job.

127
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:14,553
You just didn't want to pay for it.

128
00:23:15,304 --> 00:23:17,516
Huh. You are sick.

129
00:23:18,854 --> 00:23:20,188
Hey! Hey!

130
00:23:20,271 --> 00:23:21,570
Hey, what are you doing?

131
00:23:22,554 --> 00:23:23,821
Stop! Stop it!

132
00:23:23,905 --> 00:23:26,563
- What, are you crazy?
- Break it up, goddamn it!

133
00:23:26,647 --> 00:23:29,964
That's enough! That's it! Now, cut it out!

134
00:23:30,047 --> 00:23:32,772
Goddamn it, I said cut it out!

135
00:23:34,363 --> 00:23:36,615
- Am I under arrest?
- Not yet.

136
00:23:37,036 --> 00:23:40,869
- Then we're through.
- Nash, we're just getting started!

137
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:46,165
...garage and water from the sprinkler.

138
00:23:46,585 --> 00:23:50,129
It also left a man's decapitated body

139
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:53,632
lying on the floor
next to his own severed head.

140
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:56,735
A head which at this time has no name.

141
00:23:56,785 --> 00:23:58,737
I know his name.

142
00:24:32,591 --> 00:24:36,595
Okay, Mr. Victor Kruger. Room 315.

143
00:24:37,596 --> 00:24:40,519
And I'm going to hit you
for twenty in advance.

144
00:24:48,277 --> 00:24:53,192
If there's anything you need, you know,
broads or blow, just dial 0, huh?

145
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:58,537
That's right, Mr. Kruger. Lucky Strike
means fine tobacco. I'll tell you that.

146
00:24:58,947 --> 00:25:02,451
- Don't talk to the guests!
- I didn't do nothin'!

147
00:25:54,423 --> 00:25:56,345
At last!

148
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,427
The Gathering!

149
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:03,852
Hi!

150
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:05,304
I'm Candy.

151
00:26:09,148 --> 00:26:11,150
Of course you are.

152
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,661
Come on in.

153
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:25,083
- Hiya.
- Hi.

154
00:26:25,204 --> 00:26:28,167
- Got a present for you from the coroner.
- Yeah, what's that?

155
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,500
Pieces of metal. Found them
on the dead guy under the Garden.

156
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:34,333
In the wound and on the clothes.

157
00:26:35,043 --> 00:26:37,136
Real smooth shave.

158
00:26:54,153 --> 00:26:55,444
That can't be right.

159
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:02,531
Son of a bitch!

160
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,761
Who's there?

161
00:28:21,069 --> 00:28:24,863
- Hey, Brenda. The usual?
- Lots of it.

162
00:28:29,538 --> 00:28:31,119
Say when.

163
00:28:35,544 --> 00:28:36,705
When.

164
00:28:39,758 --> 00:28:41,910
Excuse me a minute, Brenda.

165
00:28:42,631 --> 00:28:44,923
A double Glenmorangie on the rocks.

166
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,266
Glenmorangie? Right.

167
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:51,470
- Go to the Garden often?
- What did you say?

168
00:29:02,361 --> 00:29:04,152
What did you say?

169
00:29:06,114 --> 00:29:08,407
Madison Square Garden.

170
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:12,371
Do you go there often?

171
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:13,872
Why?

172
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:16,955
Basketball,

173
00:29:17,376 --> 00:29:19,127
the circus, wrestling...

174
00:29:19,838 --> 00:29:22,481
Why are you asking me about the Garden?
Have you been following me?

175
00:29:24,673 --> 00:29:27,716
I'd like to walk you home, Brenda.

176
00:29:34,683 --> 00:29:37,065
I can take care of myself.

177
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,841
Be quiet.

178
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,490
Here, take this.

179
00:31:43,351 --> 00:31:45,303
Nice to see you again, Mcleod.

180
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:47,195
Nice yourself.

181
00:31:50,028 --> 00:31:52,901
- Stop!
- There can be only one!

182
00:31:56,865 --> 00:31:58,076
No!

183
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:05,504
Hey, you, on the ground.
This is the police!

184
00:32:05,964 --> 00:32:09,427
Put down your weapons.
Put your hands on your heads.

185
00:32:09,468 --> 00:32:12,881
Another time, Highlander. I will find you!

186
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:17,305
Hey! Hold it right there! Come back here!

187
00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:23,351
Stop! Wait a minute!

188
00:32:23,772 --> 00:32:25,443
Who in the name of God was that?

189
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:27,445
He called you Highlander.
What did he mean?

190
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:28,773
"There can only be one." Only one what?

191
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:29,874
Listen, lady, you almost...

192
00:32:29,898 --> 00:32:32,450
- I want to know...
- Shut up!

193
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:35,694
Don't you ever follow me again.

194
00:32:36,114 --> 00:32:39,327
You only have one life. If you value it...

195
00:32:39,748 --> 00:32:41,500
go home.

196
00:32:54,382 --> 00:32:56,464
You saw the wound, Angus.

197
00:32:57,345 --> 00:33:00,468
- He should have died.
- I say he's got the devil in him!

198
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,952
Drinking with us, are you?

199
00:33:24,372 --> 00:33:27,996
- What's the matter, Dougal?
- You, talking and breathing.

200
00:33:28,416 --> 00:33:30,128
Last night all but a corpse.

201
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:33,111
How did you manage that, Connor Mcloed?

202
00:33:33,151 --> 00:33:34,472
Would you rather I was dead?

203
00:33:34,593 --> 00:33:37,005
It's not natural.

204
00:33:39,928 --> 00:33:41,560
He's in league with Lucifer.

205
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,312
Don't say that, Kate!

206
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:48,857
I'll say it! You've the devil in you.

207
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,020
We've been kinsmen 20 years!

208
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:57,866
Connor MacLeod was my kinsman.
I don't know who you are.

209
00:34:04,372 --> 00:34:06,745
- Angus.
- You'd better go, Connor.

210
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,630
I'm not going anywhere.

211
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,882
He's the devil! Kill him!

212
00:34:37,025 --> 00:34:39,077
- Dougal!
- Leave him be!

213
00:34:39,651 --> 00:34:40,652
Dougal...

214
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:42,240
Go on, kill him!

215
00:34:43,912 --> 00:34:45,744
He's your cousin, man!

216
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,884
No, Angus!

217
00:34:57,135 --> 00:34:58,967
Quiet! Quiet!

218
00:35:00,508 --> 00:35:02,801
There'll be no burning here today.

219
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,013
We'll banish him.

220
00:35:05,433 --> 00:35:08,016
No! Burn him!

221
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,772
Burn him!

222
00:35:14,192 --> 00:35:17,065
- Can you walk?
- I'll bloody well walk out of here.

223
00:35:17,445 --> 00:35:19,778
Then go, while you still can!

224
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,952
I'll not forget you, Angus.

225
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:34,582
That's a good dog.

226
00:37:44,052 --> 00:37:45,884
- Pie and ale, do you want it?
- Aye.

227
00:37:46,004 --> 00:37:47,675
Right now!

228
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,220
You filthy sod! You're all muck and muscle.

229
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,104
Aye, blossom. The way you like it.

230
00:38:17,665 --> 00:38:21,459
You can do that to me forever,
if you like, my Lord.

231
00:38:24,342 --> 00:38:27,966
- Will you, Connor?
- Aye, blossom. I will.

232
00:38:34,722 --> 00:38:35,763
Hello!

233
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,191
Greetings.

234
00:38:44,542 --> 00:38:47,815
I am Juan Sánchez Villa-Lobos Ramírez,

235
00:38:48,236 --> 00:38:51,119
chief metallurgist to
King Charles V of Spain,

236
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:53,531
and I'm at your service.

237
00:38:54,412 --> 00:38:55,453
Who?

238
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:03,171
- What do you want?
- You.

239
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,346
You're Connor MacLeod.

240
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:10,218
- Maybe I am...
- You're Connor MacLeod,

241
00:39:10,638 --> 00:39:12,350
wounded in battle

242
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,702
and driven from your village of Glenfinnan

243
00:39:15,003 --> 00:39:16,514
five years ago.

244
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,356
Connor!

245
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,360
Heather, go in the house.

246
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,531
I'll stay right here.

247
00:39:23,651 --> 00:39:25,603
Do as I say, woman!

248
00:39:39,827 --> 00:39:41,789
The sensation you're feeling

249
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,672
is the Quickening.

250
00:39:46,965 --> 00:39:50,548
- Who are you?
- We are the same, MacLeod.

251
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:54,052
We are brothers!

252
00:40:00,979 --> 00:40:03,771
I knew you guys were bottle-fed.

253
00:40:05,813 --> 00:40:09,027
Yeah, well, there's not a hell of a lot
I can do about it, pal.

254
00:40:09,567 --> 00:40:11,149
You see what I'm up against!

255
00:40:11,569 --> 00:40:14,532
His Vietnamese neighbor ate his dog.

256
00:40:16,074 --> 00:40:17,715
That's confidential.

257
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:21,039
- How are things over at forensics?
- Dull.

258
00:40:21,459 --> 00:40:25,323
- How about some lunch?
- Lunch? It's a good idea. Who pays?

259
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,415
- Me.
- You're on.

260
00:40:27,835 --> 00:40:29,427
- Oh, by the way, Frank.
- Yeah.

261
00:40:29,477 --> 00:40:31,229
- The hairs in the Moretti case?
- Uh-huh.

262
00:40:31,279 --> 00:40:33,431
- They matched up.
- What did I tell you?

263
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,423
Oh! I forgot my purse.

264
00:40:35,974 --> 00:40:37,515
I'll meet you outside.

265
00:40:38,476 --> 00:40:41,269
Garfield, Brenda and I are going to lunch.

266
00:41:26,434 --> 00:41:30,318
Sometimes, MacLeod,
the sharpest blade is not enough.

267
00:41:34,782 --> 00:41:40,658
# B-A-L-A-N-C-E #

268
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:42,500
# Balance #

269
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:46,584
I don't like boats. I don't like water.
I'm a man not a fish.

270
00:41:47,795 --> 00:41:49,747
As you complain endlessly.

271
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:52,610
You look like a woman, you stupid haggis!

272
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,043
Haggis? What is haggis?

273
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,465
A sheep's stomach
stuffed with meat and barley.

274
00:41:59,057 --> 00:42:01,889
- And what do you do with it?
- You eat it!

275
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,102
How revolting!

276
00:42:05,813 --> 00:42:08,656
Be still for God's
sake! You'll tip us over!

277
00:42:08,716 --> 00:42:09,727
So?

278
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,859
I cannot swim, you Spanish peacock!

279
00:42:11,899 --> 00:42:13,731
I'm not Spanish, I'm Egyptian.

280
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,333
You said you were from Spain.

281
00:42:15,383 --> 00:42:16,484
You are a liar!

282
00:42:17,945 --> 00:42:22,080
You have the manners of a goat,
and you smell like a dungheap,

283
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:26,834
and you've no knowledge whatsoever
of your potential. Now!

284
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:29,707
- Get out!
- No!

285
00:42:31,169 --> 00:42:35,153
Help! Help! Help!

286
00:42:37,355 --> 00:42:38,556
Help!

287
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:42,049
- Help me, I'm drowning!
- You can't drown, you fool!

288
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:44,102
You're Immortal.

289
00:42:46,894 --> 00:42:49,016
I'm drowning!

290
00:42:49,437 --> 00:42:52,650
# We ask you Thy, #

291
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,693
# Heavenly Father... #

292
00:42:58,696 --> 00:42:59,697
I'm alive!

293
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,244
I can breathe!

294
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:27,605
I'm going to slice you in half.

295
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:59,797
Crude and slow, clansman. Your attack
was no better than that of a clumsy child.

296
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,767
This cannot be.

297
00:44:10,598 --> 00:44:12,099
It's the devil's work.

298
00:44:15,443 --> 00:44:19,237
You cannot die, MacLeod. Accept it.

299
00:44:24,282 --> 00:44:26,284
- I hate you.
- Good.

300
00:44:26,704 --> 00:44:28,906
That is a perfect way to start.

301
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:34,001
Tell me, how did it happen for God's sake?

302
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:39,967
Why does the sun come up? Hmm?

303
00:44:41,008 --> 00:44:46,053
Or are the stars just pinholes
in the curtain of night? Who knows?

304
00:44:47,094 --> 00:44:51,018
What I do know is that
because you were born different,

305
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:54,812
men will fear you, try to drive you away,

306
00:44:55,233 --> 00:44:57,104
like the people of your village.

307
00:45:08,246 --> 00:45:11,539
You must learn to conceal your special gift

308
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,081
and harness your power

309
00:45:14,502 --> 00:45:17,084
until the time of the Gathering.

310
00:45:20,047 --> 00:45:21,589
What Gathering?

311
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,961
When only a few of us are left,

312
00:45:24,382 --> 00:45:29,467
we will feel an irresistible pull
towards a faraway land

313
00:45:29,887 --> 00:45:32,430
to fight for the prize.

314
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:36,394
Come on!

315
00:45:37,685 --> 00:45:38,896
Faster!

316
00:45:48,446 --> 00:45:50,538
Never lose your temper.

317
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:55,543
If your head comes away from your neck,
it's over.

318
00:46:21,649 --> 00:46:23,481
Never overextend your thrust.

319
00:46:24,111 --> 00:46:27,905
You're vulnerable and off balance.

320
00:46:28,366 --> 00:46:29,987
Connor!

321
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,531
Heather, please!

322
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:50,888
If it came down to just us two,
would you take my head?

323
00:46:56,684 --> 00:46:59,937
We must fight until only one remains.

324
00:47:00,358 --> 00:47:04,772
You're safe only on holy ground.
None of us will violate that law.

325
00:47:05,192 --> 00:47:06,904
It's tradition.

326
00:47:19,957 --> 00:47:22,129
Now for the last.

327
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:24,712
Trust me.

328
00:47:27,885 --> 00:47:30,388
Let yourself feel the stag.

329
00:47:33,681 --> 00:47:36,974
His heart... beating,

330
00:47:44,311 --> 00:47:45,853
his blood...

331
00:47:46,273 --> 00:47:47,314
coursing.

332
00:47:47,695 --> 00:47:49,356
Feel?

333
00:47:50,738 --> 00:47:52,990
- Come on!
- I feel him.

334
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:57,875
MacLeod, come on!

335
00:47:58,456 --> 00:48:00,998
- I feel him!
- Come on!

336
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,293
I feel him!

337
00:48:10,588 --> 00:48:12,840
Come on, Haggis!

338
00:48:16,303 --> 00:48:20,728
MacLeod, this is the Quickening!

339
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,901
- Yeah!
- Yes!

340
00:48:57,224 --> 00:49:02,560
Now, Pendejo, shall we see
what sort of swordsman you've become?

341
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,391
En garde!

342
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:13,991
Very good.

343
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,052
Give me your hand, brother.

344
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,982
That one there. How much is it?

345
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,091
Put him in.

346
00:50:14,712 --> 00:50:16,343
But what I want is a family.

347
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:20,558
You cannot have a family.
We cannot have children.

348
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:26,263
That won't please Heather.
I'll tell you that for nothing.

349
00:50:28,315 --> 00:50:30,437
He's full of life.

350
00:50:32,479 --> 00:50:33,520
Connor!

351
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,445
Here's dinner.

352
00:50:40,447 --> 00:50:43,661
I'll be off now.
I fancy buying myself a new dress.

353
00:50:47,494 --> 00:50:50,337
Oh, you little devils. Go on!

354
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,592
She is beautiful.

355
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:58,676
You must leave her, brother.

356
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,438
MacLeod,

357
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:15,773
I was born 2,437 years ago.

358
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:19,156
In that time I've had 3 wives.

359
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:22,489
The last was Shakiko,
a Japanese princess.

360
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:27,534
Her father, Masamune, a genius,
made this for me.

361
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,918
In 593 B.C.

362
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,381
It is the only one of its kind,

363
00:51:36,253 --> 00:51:38,085
like his daughter.

364
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:42,179
When Shakiko died, I was shattered.

365
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,762
I would save you that pain.

366
00:51:45,552 --> 00:51:47,895
Please, let Heather go.

367
00:52:06,533 --> 00:52:11,328
When we first met, you felt ill, remember?

368
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:15,973
That wasn't the first time
you felt that sensation, was it?

369
00:52:16,013 --> 00:52:17,034
No.

370
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:21,218
When the MacLeods fought the Frasers,
and a black knight...

371
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:24,191
I felt it then.

372
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,553
Only it was different, more painful.

373
00:52:26,974 --> 00:52:32,139
That black knight was the Kurgan.
It's because of him that I sought you out.

374
00:52:34,692 --> 00:52:37,444
Who is the Kurgan?
And where does he come from?

375
00:52:37,855 --> 00:52:41,278
The Kurgans were an ancient people
from the steppes of Russia.

376
00:52:41,699 --> 00:52:47,074
For amusement they tossed children into
pits with hungry dogs to fight for meat.

377
00:52:47,494 --> 00:52:51,618
The Kurgan. He is the strongest
of all the Immortals.

378
00:52:52,039 --> 00:52:54,752
He is the perfect warrior.

379
00:52:55,502 --> 00:53:00,297
If he wins the prize, mortal man
would suffer an eternity of darkness.

380
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:03,881
How do you fight such a savage?

381
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:08,846
With heart, faith and steel.

382
00:53:09,266 --> 00:53:12,179
In the end, there can be only one.

383
00:53:17,314 --> 00:53:19,496
It must have been very dangerous for you.

384
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:22,359
Well, I was very much in love with her,
my dear Heather.

385
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:25,993
She was the only thing on my mind,
not danger.

386
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:30,287
So, holding the rose in my teeth,
I climbed up on the rooftop,

387
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:34,912
lowered a rope and swung in
through the open window.

388
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:41,959
- Unfortunately, the lady was no longer there.
- What did you do?

389
00:53:42,379 --> 00:53:45,592
I introduced myself to
the lady thatwas there.

390
00:53:46,013 --> 00:53:48,265
She was most helpful.

391
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,519
Would you like some more wine?

392
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:54,351
Yes, please.

393
00:54:06,784 --> 00:54:09,827
- Heather, get out.
- What's wrong?

394
00:54:15,913 --> 00:54:16,914
Get out!

395
00:54:20,377 --> 00:54:21,628
Kurgan!

396
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:24,842
Ramírez!

397
00:54:34,311 --> 00:54:37,855
The Highlander, where is he?

398
00:54:38,355 --> 00:54:42,820
- You're too late. I've prepared him for you.
- You waste your time!

399
00:55:10,007 --> 00:55:11,008
It hurts?

400
00:55:24,862 --> 00:55:26,693
Now you die!

401
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:35,032
You cannot win, Ramírez. I'm the strongest!

402
00:55:35,412 --> 00:55:37,374
My cut has improved your voice.

403
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:20,887
Yes!

404
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,092
Hurts?

405
00:57:59,176 --> 00:58:01,058
Who is the woman?

406
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,272
She's mine.

407
00:58:06,273 --> 00:58:08,565
Not for much longer.

408
00:58:18,445 --> 00:58:21,038
Tonight you sleep in hell.

409
00:58:21,828 --> 00:58:23,790
There can be only one!

410
00:59:11,088 --> 00:59:13,250
Hello, pretty!

411
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:25,862
I'd like to speak to Russell Nash.

412
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:28,725
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Nash isn't here
at the moment.

413
00:59:29,146 --> 00:59:31,268
May I call him at home?
I have to talk to him today.

414
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,770
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

415
00:59:34,651 --> 00:59:38,865
- Good morning.
- This is Brenda Wyatt, Mr. Nash.

416
00:59:40,197 --> 00:59:43,950
We've already met, Rachel.
What can I do for you?

417
00:59:44,371 --> 00:59:45,872
I'd like some advice.

418
00:59:46,373 --> 00:59:48,885
Are you the kind of woman
who takes advice?

419
00:59:49,286 --> 00:59:51,998
- That depends.
- Advice about what?

420
00:59:52,879 --> 00:59:55,792
What can you tell me about a 7" lunatic
hacking away with a broadsword

421
00:59:55,832 --> 00:59:58,885
at 1 o'clock in the morning
in Ney York city, 1985?

422
01:00:01,928 --> 01:00:02,929
Not much.

423
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:06,002
What about a Japanese sword
dated 600 B.C.?

424
01:00:06,203 --> 01:00:08,705
The metal in the blade folded 200 times.

425
01:00:09,396 --> 01:00:11,478
I don't deal in exotic weapons.

426
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:15,192
Can I show you something
in 18th century silver?

427
01:00:15,812 --> 01:00:18,945
That's not why I came
here, and you know it.

428
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:22,819
- Do you cook?
- Why?

429
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,492
I thought we might have dinner.

430
01:00:26,032 --> 01:00:27,544
- Did you?
- Yes.

431
01:00:30,707 --> 01:00:36,213
So, I'm standing there, and there's Brenda!
Our little Brenda.

432
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,505
You're sure it was Brenda?

433
01:00:40,217 --> 01:00:42,469
She was in Nash's shop.
She was talking to him.

434
01:00:51,017 --> 01:00:55,642
- What are you looking at, Rachel?
- The eyes in the back of your head.

435
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:02,239
People are asking about you.
What am I supposed to say?

436
01:01:04,781 --> 01:01:07,113
Tell them I'm Immortal.

437
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:10,327
Attention! Four men over here!

438
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,741
Quiet.

439
01:01:50,577 --> 01:01:51,948
Don't be afraid.

440
01:01:52,499 --> 01:01:54,581
- What's your name?
- Rachel.

441
01:01:55,001 --> 01:01:58,295
- What happened?
- Everybody is dead.

442
01:02:02,088 --> 01:02:03,920
I'm like you. I'm alone.

443
01:02:04,341 --> 01:02:06,303
Come with me, Rachel.

444
01:02:20,777 --> 01:02:26,533
- You're alive! Why didn't you die?
- Hey, it's a kind of magic.

445
01:02:30,867 --> 01:02:32,949
- You should be dead!
- Move!

446
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,122
No! You'll have to shoot me first.

447
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:40,507
Whatever you say, Jack.
You're the master race.

448
01:02:44,841 --> 01:02:46,303
Let's go.

449
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:50,136
That was a long time ago.

450
01:02:51,057 --> 01:02:53,890
Would you listen to me
for one moment, please?

451
01:02:55,101 --> 01:02:58,975
You can't hide your feelings from me.
I've known you too long.

452
01:02:59,396 --> 01:03:02,689
- What feelings?
- How about loneliness?

453
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:05,362
I'm not lonely.

454
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:09,946
- I've got everything I need right here.
- Oh no, you don't.

455
01:03:11,828 --> 01:03:14,871
You refuse to let anyone love you.

456
01:03:15,912 --> 01:03:17,534
Love is for poets.

457
01:03:22,168 --> 01:03:24,791
You're such a romantic, Rachel.

458
01:03:25,922 --> 01:03:27,844
You always were.

459
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:51,948
Just a minute!

460
01:04:11,177 --> 01:04:12,338
Good evening.

461
01:04:17,554 --> 01:04:20,897
Do you want to dine in the hall,
or shall we step inside?

462
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,151
Come in.

463
01:04:26,773 --> 01:04:28,064
May I take your coat?

464
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,396
- No thanks.
- What?

465
01:04:29,616 --> 01:04:32,489
- I'll hold on to it.
- Oh, fine.

466
01:04:36,953 --> 01:04:39,576
- Where are you going?
- I forgot my earrings.

467
01:04:39,996 --> 01:04:43,540
Make yourself a drink.
There are glasses in the bar.

468
01:04:55,972 --> 01:04:57,684
Do you know what you're doing?

469
01:05:19,496 --> 01:05:21,157
I like your place, Brenda.

470
01:05:21,578 --> 01:05:25,411
I've only been here 3 months.
I'm still cleaning it up.

471
01:05:29,876 --> 01:05:33,049
- Interesting view.
- What did you say?

472
01:05:38,725 --> 01:05:41,177
I said, "interesting view".

473
01:05:41,768 --> 01:05:42,929
Isn't it great?

474
01:05:50,316 --> 01:05:53,490
You never told me what you do for a living.

475
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:58,034
I work for the Metropolitan Museum.

476
01:05:59,866 --> 01:06:01,327
In Aquisitions.

477
01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:06,953
That explains your interest
in ancient weapons.

478
01:06:08,915 --> 01:06:10,046
Right.

479
01:06:12,008 --> 01:06:14,090
Especially the Samurai.

480
01:06:15,381 --> 01:06:16,713
Very nice.

481
01:06:17,634 --> 01:06:20,597
- Shall we have a toast?
- Yes.

482
01:06:25,892 --> 01:06:27,143
Brandy.

483
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:30,567
Bottled in 1783.

484
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,689
Wow! That's old.

485
01:06:35,612 --> 01:06:38,154
1783 was a very good year.

486
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:43,079
Mozart wrote his Great Mass.

487
01:06:44,791 --> 01:06:49,125
The Montgolfier Brothers went up
in their first balloon.

488
01:06:53,089 --> 01:06:57,213
And England recognized
the independence of the United States.

489
01:06:57,634 --> 01:06:59,005
Is that right?

490
01:07:00,056 --> 01:07:01,057
Yes.

491
01:07:08,645 --> 01:07:10,266
What's that?

492
01:07:11,437 --> 01:07:14,130
- It's for you.
- Can I open it?

493
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:15,481
If you like.

494
01:07:30,206 --> 01:07:32,498
You bastard! Where did you find this?

495
01:07:32,919 --> 01:07:35,541
I have an extensive library.

496
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:40,466
Odd thing, your bio
doesn't mention the Met.

497
01:07:40,887 --> 01:07:44,761
It says you work for
the police. In forensics.

498
01:07:45,181 --> 01:07:48,975
- Are you and Moran trying to set me up?
- I don't work for Moran.

499
01:07:49,395 --> 01:07:53,900
Then why is that bald policeman sitting
outside watching your apartment?

500
01:07:55,521 --> 01:07:57,814
You remember him.
Moran's had him tailing me.

501
01:07:58,234 --> 01:07:59,866
What're you gonna do?

502
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:02,879
The question is what are you gonna do?

503
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:06,042
You're going to turn off the tape
or you're going to shoot me with the .45?

504
01:08:10,036 --> 01:08:13,990
I am not looking for a killer. I am looking
for a sword, the one used on Fasil.

505
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,792
I found pieces of it under the Garden.

506
01:08:15,892 --> 01:08:17,634
- I only want to see the Samurai.
- Why?

507
01:08:18,044 --> 01:08:20,396
I told you! Because it's
not supposed to exist!

508
01:08:20,847 --> 01:08:25,101
I dated pieces of the blade at 600 B.C.
The metal had been folded 200 times.

509
01:08:25,151 --> 01:08:27,740
The Japanese didn't start making
swords like that till the Middle Ages.

510
01:08:27,764 --> 01:08:30,056
So where the hell did it come from?

511
01:08:30,476 --> 01:08:33,509
If I could verify the existence
of such a weapon, it would be like...

512
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:37,984
discovering 747 a thousand years
before the Wright Brothers ever flew.

513
01:08:39,065 --> 01:08:40,406
This is crazy.

514
01:08:40,817 --> 01:08:44,280
Wait a minute, Nash, I want some answers.

515
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:46,913
You want?

516
01:08:47,914 --> 01:08:50,917
Don't you ever think about anything
except what you want?

517
01:09:05,932 --> 01:09:08,264
You must leave her, brother.

518
01:10:28,248 --> 01:10:29,665
Heather!

519
01:10:46,666 --> 01:10:47,667
Heather!

520
01:10:49,375 --> 01:10:52,167
Connor, I'm here!

521
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:15,932
My beautiful man.

522
01:11:17,143 --> 01:11:19,105
My husband.

523
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:21,647
I am that, my love.

524
01:11:25,731 --> 01:11:28,154
I've never really known...

525
01:11:29,325 --> 01:11:30,446
What?

526
01:11:32,118 --> 01:11:34,160
Why you stayed.

527
01:11:36,412 --> 01:11:40,036
Because I love you as much now
as the first day we met.

528
01:11:43,089 --> 01:11:44,841
And I love you.

529
01:11:49,595 --> 01:11:51,297
I don't want to die.

530
01:11:52,468 --> 01:11:54,390
I want to stay with you.

531
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:56,222
Forever.

532
01:11:56,642 --> 01:11:58,304
I want that, too.

533
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:02,398
Will you do something for me, Connor?

534
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:06,562
What, blossom?

535
01:12:07,693 --> 01:12:13,239
In the years to come, will you light a
candle and remember me on my birthday?

536
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,032
Aye, love.

537
01:12:16,452 --> 01:12:17,954
I will.

538
01:12:18,875 --> 01:12:21,327
I wanted to have your children.

539
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:25,831
They would have been strong and fine.

540
01:12:30,386 --> 01:12:32,929
Don't see me, Connor.

541
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:35,591
Let me die in peace.

542
01:12:38,224 --> 01:12:39,685
Where are we?

543
01:12:47,023 --> 01:12:49,065
We're in the Highlands.

544
01:12:51,948 --> 01:12:53,199
Where else?

545
01:12:56,913 --> 01:12:59,415
Running down a mountain side.

546
01:13:13,429 --> 01:13:15,131
The sun is shining.

547
01:13:16,933 --> 01:13:18,514
It's not cold.

548
01:13:20,516 --> 01:13:23,099
You've got your sheepskins on.

549
01:13:26,943 --> 01:13:30,066
And the boots I made for you.

550
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:35,401
Goodnight, my bonny Heather.

551
01:13:50,756 --> 01:13:52,718
Hey, Kastagir!

552
01:13:55,221 --> 01:13:58,474
MacLeod. It's good to see you again.

553
01:13:58,884 --> 01:14:01,057
It seems like a hundred years.

554
01:14:01,477 --> 01:14:03,139
It's been a hundred years.

555
01:14:11,527 --> 01:14:13,109
How've you been?

556
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:15,451
Hey!

557
01:14:15,901 --> 01:14:16,902
This...

558
01:14:18,364 --> 01:14:20,536
...puts hairs on your chest.

559
01:14:23,579 --> 01:14:26,042
- What is it?
- Boom-boom!

560
01:14:27,123 --> 01:14:30,416
A big strong man like you shouldn't
be afraid of a little boom-boom!

561
01:14:30,796 --> 01:14:35,301
- Or maybe you think I'm trying to poison you?
- I think you're crazy, Kastagir.

562
01:14:37,773 --> 01:14:40,266
So, the Gathering is here.

563
01:14:43,309 --> 01:14:48,104
- Time has almost caught us, my friend.
- Has it? You think we should go on?

564
01:14:50,566 --> 01:14:52,528
I think we should have a party.

565
01:14:52,938 --> 01:14:55,891
Oh no! I remember the last time
we had a party.

566
01:14:56,042 --> 01:14:58,194
Really, when exactly was that?

567
01:14:58,614 --> 01:15:00,326
It was 1783.

568
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:03,069
1783...

569
01:15:03,659 --> 01:15:07,453
Oh yes! Your famous duel
on Boston Common.

570
01:15:08,664 --> 01:15:09,795
You were drunk.

571
01:15:09,865 --> 01:15:12,868
- What was that guy's name again?
- His name was Bassett.

572
01:15:12,918 --> 01:15:15,461
The heavier blade, Mr. Bassett!
I implore you!

573
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:17,463
I am fighting the duel, Hotchkiss, not you!

574
01:15:19,465 --> 01:15:21,257
See if the imbecile is ready.

575
01:15:22,058 --> 01:15:25,761
- Mr. Bassett is waiting, Sir.
- Tell him I'm ready.

576
01:15:26,222 --> 01:15:28,224
Christ, I've gone blind!

577
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:30,686
En garde, Sir!

578
01:15:35,071 --> 01:15:38,484
- Wonderful, Sir.
- Thank you, Hotchkiss.

579
01:15:39,405 --> 01:15:42,528
Bassett, is that you?

580
01:15:42,988 --> 01:15:44,740
You missed him, Mr. Bassett.

581
01:16:06,102 --> 01:16:07,103
Stop, Sir!

582
01:16:07,433 --> 01:16:08,934
I beseech...

583
01:16:09,355 --> 01:16:13,579
I apologize for calling your wife
a bloated warthog.

584
01:16:15,111 --> 01:16:17,403
And I bid you a good day.

585
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:21,677
- Shoot him, Sir?
- What?

586
01:16:21,727 --> 01:16:24,216
Shoot him. Now, Sir. Now, Sir.
In the back of the head. Now, Sir!

587
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:27,243
Hotchkiss! Hotchkiss, stop it!

588
01:16:28,954 --> 01:16:31,377
- Hotchkiss...
- Sir?

589
01:16:31,787 --> 01:16:33,329
No, Sir.

590
01:16:41,887 --> 01:16:43,799
That's the mood of New York at this moment.

591
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:47,643
- Get out of here! Get out of here!
- An angry city in the grip of fear.

592
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:57,042
Earlier today, in response
to growing pressure,

593
01:16:57,083 --> 01:16:59,542
the mayor's office issued
the following statement.

594
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:02,658
- Give us a drink, pal.
- Got a joint?

595
01:17:02,698 --> 01:17:04,901
Police departments are continuing
the vigorous investigation

596
01:17:04,925 --> 01:17:07,783
following up on a number
of promising leads.

597
01:17:07,823 --> 01:17:08,914
Hey, Rockefeller.

598
01:17:09,325 --> 01:17:13,669
How'd you like Candy?
She said you were kind of kinky, huh?

599
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:17,833
Don't ever speak to me.

600
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:25,221
Look, I didn't mean...

601
01:17:27,343 --> 01:17:31,847
Don't ever speak to me again!

602
01:17:32,268 --> 01:17:34,019
Do you understand?

603
01:17:36,101 --> 01:17:37,733
Good.

604
01:17:42,528 --> 01:17:46,031
I hope you get your
head chopped off, asshole!

605
01:17:48,073 --> 01:17:50,956
And you! Shut it!

606
01:18:13,322 --> 01:18:15,863
- Hey, big boy.
- Slow down.

607
01:18:24,490 --> 01:18:25,491
What the hell?

608
01:18:39,585 --> 01:18:42,047
Okay, Marine, this is for real.

609
01:18:47,873 --> 01:18:49,024
Let's go!

610
01:18:52,808 --> 01:18:54,930
Go, go, go, go, go! Come on, come on!

611
01:19:07,533 --> 01:19:09,575
What the hell's going on?!

612
01:21:04,059 --> 01:21:05,100
For God's sake.

613
01:21:17,783 --> 01:21:19,164
Look at that!

614
01:21:57,453 --> 01:21:58,904
Mother of God...

615
01:22:03,368 --> 01:22:04,620
Mom!

616
01:22:09,795 --> 01:22:12,167
Hey, where're you going with my car?

617
01:22:12,588 --> 01:22:15,881
Daddy, help me! Daddy! Daddy, help me!

618
01:22:25,230 --> 01:22:26,942
Frank! Will you take it easy?

619
01:22:26,992 --> 01:22:30,486
I'm telling you, I checked everywhere with
everybody. There just aren't any witnesses!

620
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:32,868
That's New York for you!

621
01:22:32,988 --> 01:22:35,440
Twenty people standing around,
nobody saw a goddamn thing.

622
01:22:35,861 --> 01:22:38,654
Tell me about this Matunas.
What is he, on drugs?

623
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:39,324
He's a survival man.

624
01:22:39,364 --> 01:22:42,383
- What do you mean "survival man"?
- He's into guns. He was a Marine in Vietnam.

625
01:22:42,407 --> 01:22:46,952
I talked to his ex-CO. He said that the guy
was a little paranoid, but he was good a man.

626
01:22:49,625 --> 01:22:51,967
- How're you doing, kid?
- Okay, I guess.

627
01:22:52,017 --> 01:22:55,631
For a guy who had 3 feet of steel crammed
through his gut. How're you doing old man?

628
01:22:56,471 --> 01:22:59,174
I understand you saw the guy
that stuck you, is that right?

629
01:22:59,595 --> 01:23:01,096
You're kidding me, man.

630
01:23:01,517 --> 01:23:03,058
Is that him?

631
01:23:03,559 --> 01:23:04,560
Nope.

632
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:08,083
Come on, quit kidding, Matunas.
It was dark in that alley!

633
01:23:08,133 --> 01:23:09,725
The freak was trying to kill me!

634
01:23:10,145 --> 01:23:15,280
I'll never forget his face. He had a scar
across his neck. That ain't him.

635
01:23:15,691 --> 01:23:16,822
Shit!

636
01:23:19,785 --> 01:23:21,827
- Depressed?
- Yeah.

637
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:25,661
You don't know grunt about depressed.

638
01:23:26,081 --> 01:23:30,385
I got me a .357,
I got me a trunk load of shotguns,

639
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:33,669
I got three big-bore rifles,
and ammo up the ass.

640
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:37,212
And I ain't safe. I can't protect myself!

641
01:23:37,302 --> 01:23:39,555
Okay, Take it easy, pal. Take it easy!

642
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:42,558
That weirdo, man. He got up,

643
01:23:42,968 --> 01:23:47,142
after I'd put enough lead
in him to drop a rhino.

644
01:23:47,563 --> 01:23:50,806
Hey, listen, listen. You think you could
work with one of our artists,

645
01:23:50,856 --> 01:23:53,128
maybe come up with a picture of this guy?

646
01:23:53,228 --> 01:23:55,571
Sure. Sure. Yes.

647
01:23:56,321 --> 01:23:58,193
Take it easy, pal.

648
01:23:59,324 --> 01:24:01,196
- Hey, cop!
- Yeah?

649
01:24:01,617 --> 01:24:03,659
I know you guys think I'm nuts,

650
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:06,842
but there's something
else I gotta tell you.

651
01:24:07,583 --> 01:24:10,165
After he threw me against the wall...

652
01:24:29,685 --> 01:24:31,767
- This is getting like "One Step Beyond".
- Yeah.

653
01:24:31,867 --> 01:24:34,165
Listen, when we get out there, remember.
All we've got is an eye-witness.

654
01:24:34,189 --> 01:24:36,571
Now, don't say anything about
swordfights in New York city,

655
01:24:36,622 --> 01:24:38,473
or guys glowing in the
dark for Christ's sake.

656
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:42,077
Hey, Moran!

657
01:24:42,447 --> 01:24:44,449
Have you read what it says in here?

658
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:47,953
Are you kidding, Tony?
You know cops can't read.

659
01:24:48,373 --> 01:24:50,826
What does "incompetent" mean?

660
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:56,291
That mayor, he calls me
at 2 o'clock in the morning!

661
01:24:56,712 --> 01:24:58,964
I mean, I don't even answer
the phone anymore.

662
01:24:59,384 --> 01:25:02,137
What does "baffled" mean?

663
01:25:33,789 --> 01:25:36,792
Karen Joan Nash.

664
01:25:38,794 --> 01:25:40,676
Yeah, I remember this one.

665
01:25:41,086 --> 01:25:44,740
I was practicing in Syracuse.
Didn't get many of these.

666
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:45,931
What?

667
01:25:46,341 --> 01:25:50,385
Unwed mothers.
Nowadays, that's no big deal.

668
01:25:51,687 --> 01:25:55,640
Back then in Syracuse,
that was a stoning offense.

669
01:25:57,062 --> 01:25:58,063
What happened?

670
01:25:59,354 --> 01:26:02,778
- She had the baby and she died.
- So, Nash was illegitimate?

671
01:26:03,198 --> 01:26:06,361
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he was illegitimate.

672
01:26:06,782 --> 01:26:10,325
For about a minute and a half.
He died right after she did.

673
01:26:14,790 --> 01:26:16,121
He died?

674
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:28,593
Hello, Brenda.

675
01:26:29,224 --> 01:26:30,525
I did what you asked.

676
01:26:30,565 --> 01:26:33,799
I spent all night going through the old
deeds to Nash's house in Hudson Street,

677
01:26:33,849 --> 01:26:38,934
all the way back back through the five previous
owners to the original guy, Montague in 1796.

678
01:26:39,354 --> 01:26:42,527
In all five instances,
Montague through Nash,

679
01:26:42,948 --> 01:26:46,571
I found a death certificate for a kid
with the same name who died at birth,

680
01:26:46,992 --> 01:26:50,655
years before he pretended
to sign for his inheritance.

681
01:26:51,706 --> 01:26:53,578
Jesus, Rick. Isn't there any heat in here?

682
01:26:53,999 --> 01:26:56,001
No, heat is bad for the circuits.

683
01:26:56,411 --> 01:26:59,294
Now, just in case there's any doubt...

684
01:27:21,396 --> 01:27:23,088
So what you've got here, Brenda,

685
01:27:23,138 --> 01:27:26,231
is a guy who's been creeping around
since at least 1700,

686
01:27:26,651 --> 01:27:28,824
pretending to croak every once in a while,

687
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:33,038
leaving all these goods to kids
who've been corpses for years

688
01:27:33,408 --> 01:27:35,580
and assuming their identities.

689
01:27:41,166 --> 01:27:43,168
It's not possible.

690
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:49,304
"Post" final!
Cops release Headhunter picture!

691
01:27:49,714 --> 01:27:51,266
- Reward offered!
- I'll take a "Post".

692
01:27:51,316 --> 01:27:53,138
- Me too.
- Headhunter revealed!

693
01:28:26,922 --> 01:28:29,174
For you, my bonny Heather.

694
01:28:30,425 --> 01:28:32,297
Happy birthday.

695
01:28:34,349 --> 01:28:36,471
And you, Juan Ramírez.

696
01:28:38,513 --> 01:28:41,056
Take care of her, you overdressed haggis.

697
01:29:18,393 --> 01:29:20,595
Kastagir is gone.

698
01:29:21,016 --> 01:29:23,348
Only you and I remain.

699
01:29:30,986 --> 01:29:33,899
Nice to see you, Kurgan.

700
01:29:34,409 --> 01:29:35,951
Who cuts your hair?

701
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:39,074
I am in disguise.

702
01:29:40,495 --> 01:29:43,168
This way no one will recognize me.

703
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:46,922
I do.

704
01:29:49,044 --> 01:29:51,466
- What do you want?
- Your head.

705
01:29:53,178 --> 01:29:54,799
And the prize.

706
01:29:57,092 --> 01:29:58,433
Watch.

707
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:01,436
Happy Halloween, ladies!

708
01:30:10,946 --> 01:30:13,818
Nuns! No sense of humor.

709
01:30:14,859 --> 01:30:19,324
Ramírez's blade did not cut deeply enough.

710
01:30:19,744 --> 01:30:21,916
He was right about you. You're slime.

711
01:30:22,037 --> 01:30:24,539
Ramírez was an effete snob!

712
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:27,082
He died on his knees.

713
01:30:27,502 --> 01:30:33,048
I took his head and raped his woman
before his blood was even cold.

714
01:30:42,057 --> 01:30:44,269
I see!

715
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:46,982
Ramírez lied.

716
01:30:49,894 --> 01:30:52,067
She was not his woman.

717
01:30:53,108 --> 01:30:54,939
She was your woman.

718
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:57,993
And she never told you.

719
01:30:59,114 --> 01:31:01,406
I wonder why.

720
01:31:01,826 --> 01:31:06,251
Perhaps I gave her something
you never could...

721
01:31:08,373 --> 01:31:12,707
and secretly she yearned for my return.

722
01:31:13,128 --> 01:31:15,130
Holy ground, Highlander!

723
01:31:15,550 --> 01:31:18,593
Remember what Ramírez taught you.

724
01:31:23,308 --> 01:31:25,890
You can't stay in here forever.

725
01:31:28,813 --> 01:31:30,815
You are weak, Highlander.

726
01:31:31,316 --> 01:31:36,731
You will always be weaker than I.

727
01:31:40,865 --> 01:31:42,577
I'll be out front.

728
01:31:47,162 --> 01:31:48,703
Goodbye, MacLeod.

729
01:31:49,124 --> 01:31:51,666
We will meet soon enough.

730
01:32:03,888 --> 01:32:05,970
This is the house of God.

731
01:32:06,391 --> 01:32:09,104
People are trying to pray.
You're disturbing them.

732
01:32:10,775 --> 01:32:14,319
He cares about these helpless mortals?

733
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:17,442
Of course he cares.

734
01:32:17,862 --> 01:32:19,864
He died for our sins.

735
01:32:20,285 --> 01:32:22,237
That shall be his undoing.

736
01:32:24,489 --> 01:32:25,490
Father,

737
01:32:26,701 --> 01:32:28,413
forgive me.

738
01:32:28,833 --> 01:32:31,336
I am a worm.

739
01:32:44,759 --> 01:32:47,142
I have something to say.

740
01:32:47,562 --> 01:32:50,975
It's better to burn out than to fade away.

741
01:33:00,325 --> 01:33:02,076
I need to see him, goddamn it!

742
01:33:02,157 --> 01:33:05,160
I'm afraid that's
impossible. Mr. Nash is...

743
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:08,703
Mr. Nash is dead, Miss Ellenstein!

744
01:33:11,286 --> 01:33:14,829
- What are you doing here?
- I'm looking for a dead guy named Nash.

745
01:33:15,250 --> 01:33:17,292
He died at birth in Syracuse, New York.

746
01:33:23,598 --> 01:33:24,759
All right.

747
01:33:25,930 --> 01:33:27,302
Come on.

748
01:33:53,748 --> 01:33:55,870
Are the claymores real?

749
01:33:57,462 --> 01:34:01,716
What is this, a museum?
This stuff must be worth a fortune.

750
01:34:10,595 --> 01:34:13,768
I have been alive for
four and a half centuries.

751
01:34:14,189 --> 01:34:15,690
I cannot die.

752
01:34:18,443 --> 01:34:20,855
Well, everybody's got their problems.

753
01:34:27,572 --> 01:34:29,033
What are you goning to do with that?

754
01:34:29,454 --> 01:34:30,995
Take it.

755
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:48,723
I am Connor MacLeod of the clan MacLeod.

756
01:34:49,474 --> 01:34:54,269
I was born in 1518 in the village of
Glennfinnan on the shores of Loch Shiel.

757
01:34:56,521 --> 01:34:58,233
And I am immortal.

758
01:36:37,392 --> 01:36:38,793
You're not listening.

759
01:36:39,293 --> 01:36:42,957
Brenda, it isn't going to work.
I can't get involved, not again.

760
01:36:56,310 --> 01:36:58,553
You know what's weird?

761
01:36:58,973 --> 01:37:01,225
Most people are afraid to die.

762
01:37:01,646 --> 01:37:03,808
That's not your problem.

763
01:37:04,228 --> 01:37:06,521
You're afraid to live.

764
01:37:11,195 --> 01:37:13,117
Take care of yourself.

765
01:37:13,528 --> 01:37:15,450
Don't lose your head.

766
01:37:31,135 --> 01:37:33,007
Hello, pretty.

767
01:37:37,932 --> 01:37:38,933
Come on, open up!

768
01:37:47,982 --> 01:37:49,444
Mamma mia.

769
01:38:11,506 --> 01:38:13,007
You ever played chicken?

770
01:38:17,692 --> 01:38:19,694
Here we go!

771
01:38:22,096 --> 01:38:23,397
Watch out!

772
01:38:59,433 --> 01:39:00,735
Excuse me!

773
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:25,660
Watch out!

774
01:39:44,402 --> 01:39:48,236
# New York, New York #

775
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:52,528
- # I want to wake up #
- Shut up.

776
01:39:52,570 --> 01:39:54,612
- # In the city #
- Shut up.

777
01:39:54,695 --> 01:39:56,402
Sing along.
# That never sleeps #

778
01:39:56,486 --> 01:39:57,653
Shut up!

779
01:39:58,737 --> 01:40:02,904
- # To find I'm king of the hill #
- Are you crazy?

780
01:40:04,654 --> 01:40:06,029
Shut up!

781
01:40:07,278 --> 01:40:09,862
Shut up!

782
01:40:47,541 --> 01:40:52,536
I can entertain myself. Your friend
is a real screamer. Listen.

783
01:40:53,457 --> 01:40:56,000
Which part should I cut off first?

784
01:40:56,420 --> 01:40:58,132
I'll be waiting.

785
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:06,801
The endless killing's driven him mad.

786
01:41:07,221 --> 01:41:10,064
Rachel, there are some instructions
in the desk drawer.

787
01:41:10,364 --> 01:41:11,606
I want you to follow them.

788
01:41:12,016 --> 01:41:16,400
There is a power of attorney for you.
You'll have everything you need.

789
01:41:17,441 --> 01:41:19,193
You're not coming back!

790
01:41:20,655 --> 01:41:24,699
Even if you kill him,
you're not coming back, are you?

791
01:41:34,248 --> 01:41:39,253
Sweet Rachel, you always knew
this would happen.

792
01:41:40,294 --> 01:41:42,506
Russell Nash dies tonight.

793
01:41:57,862 --> 01:42:00,735
Hey, it's a kind of magic.

794
01:42:10,164 --> 01:42:11,826
Goodbye, Russell Nash.

795
01:47:29,893 --> 01:47:31,855
So now it ends.

796
01:47:50,464 --> 01:47:52,046
What kept you?

797
01:50:08,051 --> 01:50:10,013
There can be only one.

798
01:50:42,796 --> 01:50:45,799
The Quickening overcomes me!

799
01:50:46,680 --> 01:50:48,882
I know everything!

800
01:50:49,683 --> 01:50:52,806
I know! I know everything!

801
01:50:52,926 --> 01:50:55,148
I am everything!

802
01:51:54,288 --> 01:51:57,080
So, this is where it all began.

803
01:51:58,412 --> 01:52:00,794
Can you tell me about the prize?

804
01:52:01,214 --> 01:52:03,417
It's like a whirlwind in my head.

805
01:52:03,837 --> 01:52:08,762
But if I concentrate, I know what people
are thinking all over the world.

806
01:52:09,172 --> 01:52:13,056
Presidents, diplomats, scientists.

807
01:52:13,477 --> 01:52:16,350
I can help them understand each other.

808
01:52:17,271 --> 01:52:19,102
What am I thinking?

809
01:52:19,523 --> 01:52:23,226
You're thinking whether or not
you can love me. You can!

810
01:52:23,647 --> 01:52:28,902
I'm just like you. I can love and
have children. Live and grow old.

811
01:52:29,323 --> 01:52:32,866
You never prepared me for that,
you Spanish peacock.

812
01:52:34,698 --> 01:52:38,792
Patience, Highlander.
You have done well.

813
01:52:39,252 --> 01:52:40,994
But it will take time.

814
01:52:41,415 --> 01:52:44,418
You are generations being born and dying.

815
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:48,752
You are at one with all living things.

816
01:52:48,962 --> 01:52:52,346
Each man's thoughts and dreams
are yours to know.

817
01:52:53,927 --> 01:52:56,430
You have power beyond imagination.

818
01:52:56,850 --> 01:53:01,765
Use it well, my friend.
Don't lose your head.
