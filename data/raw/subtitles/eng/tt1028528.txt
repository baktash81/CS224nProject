1
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,843
Hold on. I gotta come up.

2
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,179
I gotta take the world's
biggest fucking piss.

3
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,014
We can't be late.

4
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,223
We won't!

5
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:30,042
- Who's holding?
- If you're not, then nobody.

6
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,752
We were kind of hoping you were.

7
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,421
- Yeah. How are you not holding?
- Jesus Christ, Shanna.

8
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:37,591
It is not my fucking job to supply 
y'all with weed when we go out.

9
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,010
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, little lady.

10
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,845
You're getting angry kind of quick,
don't you think?

11
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,056
- I was just teasing you.
- I'm not angry.

12
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,768
It just would be nice if y'all didn't
just count on me all the fucking time,

13
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,270
and surprise me
every once in a while with pot.

14
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,774
Okay, mean girl in a high school movie.
Are you through having a tantrum?

15
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,068
- I'm not having a tantrum.
- Yes, you are.

16
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:59,071
You've been in the car all of two seconds,
and you're already cursing at me.

17
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:04,785
- I am not cursing at you.
- You said, "Jesus Christ, Shanna."

18
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,370
And then,
before the sentence was over,

19
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:09,081
you threw a "fucking" in there
to emphasize your "irritatance."

20
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,458
All right. Come on, guys. Don't fight.
I'll pay for it when we get some.

21
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,252
One: It is not about the money.

22
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,587
It is about the pain in the ass of scoring.

23
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,465
And two: We're not really fighting.

24
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,593
Arlene, have you forgotten
what hanging out with Jungle Julia's like?

25
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,844
That wasn't a fight.

26
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,681
That was Julia
acting like a grumpy bitch,

27
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:29,810
and me calling her on it
and indulging her at the same time.

28
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,479
That's how we tolerate each other
after all these years.

29
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,648
Oh, billboard.

30
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,028
So, what's the plan, man?

31
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,114
Margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's.

32
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,074
Did you call Rafael
and tell him we're coming?

33
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,367
- Of course.
- You're so good.

34
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,868
I know.

35
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,663
Okay, is Christian Simonson
gonna be there?

36
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,957
You bet your ass he is.
He's gonna be there with Jesse Letterman.

37
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,043
Christian Simonson,
the filmmaker, is in town.

38
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,379
He's got a big thing for Julia.

39
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,339
If he had a big thing for me,
he'd fucking call me

40
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,799
as opposed to disappearing
for six months,

41
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,010
and he'd get his ass down here
more often than he does,

42
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,721
and on my birthday,
give me a fucking phone call.

43
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,222
Oh, billboard.

44
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:18,817
Yeah, but you get those legs
of yours around him, and it's all over.

45
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,861
Yeah, well, when I'm redecorating
his house in the hills

46
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,655
that I am also living in,
I'll let you know it worked.

47
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,326
So, margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's,
touch base with Chris and Jesse,

48
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,620
tell them about later,
and make damn sure they come.

49
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,790
Those other guys will be waiting for us
to join them at the Texas Chili Parlor.

50
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,334
Oh, shit.

51
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:39,004
Speaking of which, what happened
with you and Nate last night?

52
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,798
Well, you know, not mu --
We just fucking met each other.

53
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:45,177
I mean, if you don't bust their balls a
little bit, they're never gonna respect you.

54
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,387
Okay, we're pretty clear
on what it is you didn't do.

55
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,848
How about enlightening us
on what it is you did do?

56
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,641
Nothing to write home about.

57
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,894
We just made out on the couch
for about 20 minutes.

58
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,562
Dressed, half-dressed or naked?

59
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,105
Dressed. I said we made out.

60
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,940
We didn't do the thing.

61
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,194
Excuse me for living,
but what is "the thing"?

62
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,071
You know, it's everything but.

63
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,572
They call it "the thing"?

64
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,616
I call it "the thing."

65
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,409
Do guys like the thing?

66
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,870
They like it better than no thing.

67
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,207
Okay, I wanna get back
to what it is you did do.

68
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,376
So, you're making out
on the couch with Nate, right?

69
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,460
- Correct.
- Whose couch?

70
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:22,631
- His or the one in your hotel room?
- What am I, stupid over here? Mine.

71
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,383
Were you making out
sitting up or lying down?

72
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,219
We started sitting up.
We worked our way to lying down.

73
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,930
Mmm, the plot thickens.
Who was on top?

74
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,391
I was straddling him.

75
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,476
- What else?
- That was it.

76
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,812
So we made out
for a little while on the couch,

77
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:41,608
and I said, "Okay, I'm gonna go to bed now,
so it's time for you to leave."

78
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,236
And then he starts to whine,
"Oh, right now?"

79
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,406
And I said, "Yep, right now.
Let's go."

80
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,116
And he says,
"well, wait. what about this?"

81
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,242
And I said, "No."

82
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,619
He said, "What do you mean, no?
You don't even know what I'm gonna say."

83
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,162
I said, "I already know
what you're gonna say,

84
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,539
and the answer's no."

85
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,457
He said, "How can you say
you know what I'm gonna say?"

86
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,751
I said, "Because you're gonna say,
'let's just go to sleep together.

87
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,211
"'We don't gotta do nothing.

88
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:05,215
"'Just cuddle, sleep next to each other,
wake up in the morning together.'

89
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:08,260
No, you're gonna leave,
but I'll see you tomorrow."

90
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,886
Yeah, fuck Nate.

91
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,054
I mean, he's cute and all,

92
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,140
but Jesse Letterman's
gonna be all over her.

93
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:17,727
- Jesse Letterman --
- Remember, no hooking up tonight.

94
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:21,106
You can hang out with him,
you can make out with him,

95
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:26,570
but no hooking up with him,
because we are driving to Lake LBJ tonight,

96
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,905
and my daddy's pretty clear
about one thing.

97
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,869
He said, "I am letting you
and your girlfriends stay at my lake house,

98
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:37,914
not you and a bunch of horny boys trying
to get their fuck on with my daughter."

99
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,917
- Your dad talks like that?
- Hell, yeah!

100
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,711
It's not like he ain't gonna know, either,

101
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:46,673
because when I'm staying at the lake house
with my girlfriends in our bikinis,

102
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:50,343
Daddy just has a tendency to pop up
and make sure we don't need anything.

103
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,849
Look, he's totally harmless
and cute as a bug's ear.

104
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,602
But, you know, when he's got
a bunch of half-naked poontang

105
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,770
walking the floor of his lake house,

106
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:04,024
he just likes to pay us a visit
and make sure we got everything we need.

107
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:08,528
And if you flirt shamelessly with him, like
the six-foot baby giraffe in the backseat,

108
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,447
you got a puppy dog for life.

109
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,324
I have my own relationship
with Ben,

110
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,326
and you're just jealous
'cause it don't include you.

111
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,787
- You call her dad Ben?
- I'm not a child. That's his name.

112
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,081
So when are the boys showing up?

113
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,334
They're gonna meet us
at the Chili Parlor.

114
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,710
Maybe they can bring some pot.

115
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,337
Fuck that. No.

116
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,839
I don't wanna be either
A, depending on their fucking ass,

117
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,508
or B, depending on their ass.

118
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,717
Uh-uh. We don't score ourselves,

119
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,094
we're gonna be stuck
with them all fucking night.

120
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,347
Ooh, try Lanna Frank.

121
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,057
Best idea you had all day.

122
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:40,685
Oh, hey, that's your last billboard
before Guero's.

123
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,229
Oh, come on.
Give me a break.

124
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,898
"Oh, come on," my ass!
We said every time.

125
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,275
Okay.

126
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,542
Jules, let me get a drag?
Thanks.

127
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,740
Oh, my God!

128
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,660
Hey, this is --
and I's U.T. days, Arlene.

129
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,744
- Hey.
- Hey.

130
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,414
- You wanna join us?
- For a second, but I'm with some friends.

131
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,541
Oh.

132
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,668
So you must be -- must be --

133
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,629
So you must be the infamous Butterfly.

134
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:50,839
Shh!

135
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,799
She don't know nothing about it.

136
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,718
- Know about what?
- When were y'all gonna tell her?

137
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:55,885
- Soon.
- Tell me what?

138
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,638
Yeah, now thanks to you,
we gotta tell her sooner than later.

139
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,390
All right, cut the shit.
What the fuck is going on?

140
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:03,101
I said a little somethin'-somethin'
about you on the air today.

141
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,604
Julia, what the fuck did you say
about me on the radio?

142
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:09,232
All I said was I had
a sexy friend named Butterfly

143
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,151
who was in from out of town
for the weekend,

144
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,903
and we would be going out
somewhere in Austin tonight,

145
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,448
and if they were out on the town,
maybe they'd see us.

146
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:21,453
And I described you, and I said
that if they spotted you while we were out,

147
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,997
if they'd do something,
you'd do something.

148
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,457
Okay, now, Julia, I'm serious.

149
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,126
what did you say,
and what did you say I'd do?

150
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:32,130
Anyhoo, I could explain what I said,
which would be boring,

151
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,466
or Marcy over here,

152
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,093
who is an incredible actress,
could act it out for you,

153
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,262
which, I think,
will give you a better idea

154
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,264
of what you have in store
for you tonight.

155
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,391
Okay, so just tell me your way.

156
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,477
- So we'll act it out with Marcy?
- Sure.

157
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,687
Okay, give Marcy your drink.

158
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,230
Thank you.

159
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,859
Okay, so, you're in a club or a bar,

160
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,695
and Marcy's a kind of cute
or kind of hot or kind of sexy

161
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,990
or better be fucking hysterically funny,
but not funny-looking guy

162
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,784
who you could fuck.

163
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,244
- Got it.
- Okay, Marcy, take it.

164
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,463
Howdy.

165
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,799
Hi there.

166
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:21,262
Excuse me, but your name
wouldn't be Butterfly, would it?

167
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,683
Yes, it is. It seems you have me
at a disadvantage.

168
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,226
Barry.

169
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,436
Pleased to meet you, Barry.

170
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,605
- Y'all are getting me hot.
- Shh!

171
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,987
So, is, uh, Butterfly your real name?

172
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,864
Yes, it is.

173
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,783
And how'd you know my name, Barry?

174
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,703
I listened to Jungle Julia's show
this morning.

175
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,454
Oh, you did, did you?

176
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,289
Oh, yeah. I listen to her show
every morning.

177
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,458
Oh, you do, do you?

178
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,461
Yeah. She's, like,
the coolest lady in town.

179
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,005
Don't you think she's got a big ass?

180
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,716
Nah, man.

181
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,551
I like her ass that way.

182
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,262
She got a black girl's ass.

183
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,431
Well, that's what she always says,
but, natural fact,

184
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,558
she doesn't really have
a black girl's ass.

185
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,728
- She's got a big ass.
- Okay, what the fuck are you doing?

186
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,188
Oh, look who wants to get
to the point all of a sudden.

187
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,356
Okay, we'll get to the point.

188
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,275
But for your information,
skinny bitch,

189
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:18,194
black men and a whole lot
of motherfucking white men

190
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,072
have had plenty fun
adoring my ass.

191
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,950
I don't wear their teeth marks
on my butt for nothing.

192
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,411
All right, if you're not gonna
buy me a drink, can I have mine back?

193
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,913
No. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

194
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,125
So, Butterfly, 
can I buy you a drink?

195
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,294
- I'd love one.
- What can I get you?

196
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,962
I'll take a margarita.

197
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,423
Here you go.

198
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,760
So, after they buy you a drink,

199
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,596
when they raise their glass to toast,

200
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,806
they look you dead in the eye

201
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,559
and repeat this poem:

202
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:53,772
"The woods are lovely,
dark and deep,

203
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:58,902
"and I have promises to keep
and miles to go before I sleep.

204
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,862
"Did you hear me, Butterfly?

205
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:04,115
Miles to go before you sleep."

206
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,952
And then, if they say that ...

207
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,663
you gotta give them a lap dance.

208
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,873
What?

209
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,833
If they call you Butterfly,
buy you a drink,

210
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,002
repeat that poem,
you gotta give them a lap dance.

211
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,962
That's bullshit.
I ain't giving them nothing.

212
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,798
well, you can do it or not,
but if you don't,

213
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,549
everybody in Austin's
gonna think you're a chickenshit.

214
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,803
And I don't think you want everybody
in Austin thinking you're a chickenshit.

215
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,639
I ain't giving nobody no lap dance
'cause of what you said.

216
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,057
Oh, come on.
It's gonna be funny.

217
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,893
Yeah, everything's funny to you two
when it's happening to me.

218
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,438
Look, you don't have to do it
for anybody you don't want.

219
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,607
I said you'd do it
for the first guy who says it.

220
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,652
So, some geek comes over,
trying to be cool,

221
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,571
just tell him you already did it
at another place earlier.

222
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:47,242
No harm, no foul,
but you get a free drink out of it.

223
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,869
But maybe a little later
in the evening,

224
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:53,665
you've had a few drinks,
you're kind of loosey-goosey,

225
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,834
you're safe with your girls,

226
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,671
then some kind of cute, kind of hot,
kind of sexy, hysterically funny,

227
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,674
but not funny-looking guy
comes up and says it,

228
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:06,261
then maybe you did it earlier,
maybe you didn't.

229
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,310
You made me trip.

230
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:18,106
You made me trip,
you dumb bitch!

231
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,733
Shut the --

232
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,993

That's a good fucking question.

250
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,032
Lanna Frank!

251
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,450
Where are you?

252
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,746
well, come over already.
We're waiting for you.

253
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,040
Shit!

254
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,001
Hold on!

255
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,015
So where are you?

256
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:00,018
Come over already.
We're waiting for you.

257
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,145
No, we're not coming over there.

258
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:05,231
You come over here
like you said you would.

259
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:08,317
So, is it "Shawna" and the girls
at the lake house this weekend?

260
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,778
- "Shawna"?
- Oh, fuck! I --

261
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:15,116
No. Now, there is one thing
that every girl in the whole world

262
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,077
whose name is Shanna
has in common with each other,

263
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,454
we all hate the name Shawna,

264
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,873
and we really hate it
when people call us Shawna.

265
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:03,331
Just remember, it's Shanna 
Banana, not Shawna Banawna.

266
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,459
Okay, but at some point in the evening,
I had fuckability stock.

267
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,086
Yeah. I mean ...

268
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,755
it wasn't bullish, but ...

269
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,200
Okay, Warren's sending over shots.

270
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,827
And you know the house rule:

271
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,329
If he sends over shots,
you've gotta do them.

272
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,873
- What?
- Hey, them's the rules, baby.

273
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,667
Warren says it, we do it!

274
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:51,921
I love that philosophy:
"Warren says it, we do it."

275
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:55,133
- So let's do it!
- What is it?

276
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,135
Hey, shot first, questions later.

277
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,971
Here we go! Post time!

278
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,472
Mmm!

279
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,144
Whoo-hoo!

280
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,687
Ow!

281
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,900
Now, is that a tasty beverage
or is that a tasty beverage?

282
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,360
What the fuck is it?

283
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:19,407
Chartreuse, the only liquor so good,
they named a color after it.

284
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,952
Who's down for dos Chartreuse?

285
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,204
Not me.

286
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,373
- I'm going out for a smoke.
- Okay.

287
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,792
But careful where you keep
that hot flame, all right?

288
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,502
You'll blow up the joint.

289
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,893
Drinks. What can I get you?
Shanna Banana?

290
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,562

292
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,193

293
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:58,070

00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,212
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- Whoa!

300
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:59,090
You scared the fuck
out of me, you shitty asshole!

301
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,842
I swear, Arlene,
I was not trying to scare you.

302
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,594
I just got lucky.

303
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,472
Oh, hardy-fucking-har.
Go inside.

304
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,266
- Wait a minute.
- Why?

305
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,893
- I was thinking we could make out.
- What, on a porch?

306
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,770
Not even in the bar,
but in front of the entrance?

307
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,106
- Forget it.
- No, in my car.

308
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,566
What, out there?
It's wet as fucking 'Nam out there.

309
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,860
Not in my car it's not.

310
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,821
Look, you won't get wet.

311
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:24,031
I promise you.

312
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,536
You know, most guys
wouldn't brag about that.

313
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,123
Ha-ha-ha.
You know what I mean.

314
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:36,836
Look, I know you guys are going
to Lake LBJ, and we can't come.

315
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,462
I wanna make out!

316
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,757
Okay, just stop with the whining.
It's not attractive.

317
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,015
Okay, but I don't want it
super-fucking obvious

318
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,975
to everybody
in the bar I've been gone,

319
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,853
so we'll go in your car, we'll make out
for six minutes and that's it.

320
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:54,937
- Deal?
- Great.

321
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,439
No, no, no. Deal or no deal?

322
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,858
If you're gonna whine
when I pull the plug in six minutes,

323
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,985
we can just walk back inside
the fucking bar right now.

324
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,611
- Deal. No whining.
- And no begging.

325
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,114
And no begging.
When you say done, it's done.

326
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,325
I'm gonna remember
you said that.

327
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,951
Okay, let's go.

328
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,163
Oh, you got two jobs:

329
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:15,041

my hair don't get wet.

335
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,577
before Christian Simonson shows up,

336
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:54,372
but you've got to get her out of here
before Christian Simonson shows up.

337
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,456
But what's the point?

338
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,583
They're going to Shanna's
daddy's house at Lake LBJ,

339
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,211
and it's no guys --
absolutely no guys.

340
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:03,089
Okay, so after we bring
the girls drinks,

341
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:07,676
in fairly rapid order, but not obvious,
we order two more rounds of shots.

342
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,221
You think they're 
gonna fall for that?

343
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:13,099
We'll be very convincing.

344
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,476
Now it's time to turn up the volume.
No more fucking around.

345
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,937
We go to Jäger shots.

346
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,398
Man, they're not gonna
drink Jäger shots.

347
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:24,026
Dude, as long as a guy's buying the booze,
a fucking bitch'll drink anything.

348
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,778
Come on, dude, we can at least
get one shot of Jäger

349
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,405
down these fucking bitches' throats.

350
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,448
After that, we'll see if they got
another Jäger shot in them.

351
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,533
You never know.

352
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:33,160
That could be the shot that puts
them past the point of "fuck it."

353
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,037
Then all of a sudden,
"no guys at the lake house"

354
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,747
turns into "a couple of guys
at the lake house."

355
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,249
My point exactly.

356
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,626
I know I can at least get
Shanna "Suck My" Banana

357
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,002
to do a fucking Buttery Nipple shot.

358
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,255
What's Julia's sweet shot?

359
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,881
- Key lime pie.
- Oh, come on.

360
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,801
Even fucking Leroy Brown'd
do one more for dessert.

361
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,806
Dude, check it out.

362
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,766

I had to get something out of the car,
and Nate was gentlemanly enough

380
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,694
to escort me with his umbrella.

381
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:51,155
Ah, good for you, Nate.

382
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,240
You see that pretty girl
sitting by herself at the bar?

383
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:57,578
Who, the dirty hippie?

384
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,497
Meow. She's not a hippie.

385
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,333
She might as well be a hippie.

386
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,919
Thank you, Timmy boy.

387
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,671
well, do you know
what just happened to her?

388
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:11,425
No. But I know she's a skinny,
fake-blonde bitch.

389
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:15,012
Oh, I'm sorry.
You were telling a story.

390
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,680
What about her?

391
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:23,729
Hey, Warren, is there anybody in this place
you could vouch for to give me a ride home?

392
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,859
Fair lady, your chariot awaits.

393
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,528
You've been eavesdropping?

394
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:33,614
Oh, eavesdropping
and can't help but hear.

395
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,700
I think I belong
in the latter category.

396
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,619
So, uh, Icy Hot,

397
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,038
are you offering me a ride home?

398
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:44,625
I'm offering you a lift if,
when I'm ready to leave, you are, too.

399
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,211
And when are you thinking
about leaving?

400
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,547
Truthfully, I'm not thinking about it.

401
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:53,551
But when I do,
you will be the first to know.

402
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,386
Will you be able to, uh, drive later?

403
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,639
I know looks can be deceiving,

404
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,391
but I'm a teetotaler.

405
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,851
I've been drinking club soda
and lime all night,

406
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,728
and now I'm building up
to my big drink.

407
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,355
Which is what?

408
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:09,066
Virgin piña colada.

409
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:12,903
Okay. Why would someone
who doesn't drink

410
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:16,198
spend hours at a bar
drinking water?

411
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:19,410
A bar offers all kind of things
other than alcohol.

412
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:22,246
Mmm. Really?

413
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,039
Like what?

414
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,169
Women, nacho grande platters,

415
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,880
the fellowship of some
fascinating individuals,

416
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,090
like Warren here.

417
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:37,803
Alcohol is just a lubricant
for all the individual encounters

418
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,597
that a barroom offers.

419
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,932
Ooh. Is that cowboy wisdom?

420
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:45,227
I'm not a cowboy, Pam.

421
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,062
I'm a stuntman.

422
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:51,025
But that's a very easy mistake to make.

423
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,360
How do you know my name?

424
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,322
When you were talking with Warren,

425
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:59,366
couldn't help but overhear.

426
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,202
Fair enough.
So what's your name, Icy?

427
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,873
Stuntman Mike.

428
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,541
Stuntman Mike's your name?

429
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,629
You ask anybody.

430
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,632
Hey, Warren, who is this guy?

431
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,383
Stuntman Mike.

432
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,678

- He's a stuntman.

That table. Seems to keep,
um, getting your attention.

468
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,823
Is that the girl
from the billboard outside?

469
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:48,786
- Yep.
- She sure is a striking-looking woman.

470
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,788
It's got gin, tequila --

471
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,290
- Look at that hair.
- Lots of leave-in conditioner.

472
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,378
- Is that jealousy I detect?
- Hardly.

473
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:02,424
But if you wanna get with, uh, Jungle Julia,
there's a real easy way to do that.

474
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,634
- Really?
- Yeah.

475
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,844
- What would that be?
- Get famous.

She'll find you.

477
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:11,475
And you don't even wanna know
what she did for that billboard.

478
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:14,478
Enjoy it, cocksucker.
You've earned it.

479
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,480
What did she ever do to you?

480
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:19,024
We went to school together
from kindergarten through high school.

481
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,276
That's what she did to me.

482
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,112
She was her height right now at 12.

483
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,823
She was a monster.

484
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,825
Half the guys she still fucks
from the old class,

485
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,868
she used to beat up and terrorize
in the fifth grade.

486
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,579
I see. And she used to beat you up
and take your chocolate milk, huh?

487
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,289
That pituitary case?

488
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,833
Might've kicked my ass
a couple of times.

489
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,877
Sorry. I'm built like a girl,
not a black man.

490
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:42,589
But I'd die before I ever gave
Julia Lucai my chocolate milk.

491
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:17,958
Hey, are you famous or something?

492
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,501
Or something.

493
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:22,004
No, no, no. Really.

494
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:24,673
Hey, what do you do?

495
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,300
Really?

496
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,970
What I do is work my ass off
to get my own record label off the ground.

497
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,931
But why that girl
wanted a picture of me

498
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,017
is because I'm a local deejay.

499
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,605
Wait a minute.

500
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:43,275
You got a billboard
by Big Kahuna Burger, don't you?

501
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:47,279
Yeah. I got one there,
too, Zatoichi.

502
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,409
Yeah.

503
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,745
Jungle Julia Lucai.

504
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,747

505
00:31:56,831 --> 00:32:01,376
Well, good to meet you,
Stuntman Mike.

506
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,712
Now, my friends and I are gonna
continue to get our weed on.

507
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:06,506
- Would you care for some?
- Thank you, Julia.

508
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,718
But just the same, no, thanks.

509
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,803
- Suit yourself.
- But, you know --

510
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:25,025
Aw, shit. Oh, God.

511
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,278
Sorry. It's nothing.

512
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,283
What the fuck was that?

513
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,744
Actually, I do want you
to have a shot.

514
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,790
You got some voucher here.

515
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,458
I asked him what movies
you worked on.

516
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,335
No fucking clue.

517
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:46,755
well, technically, I really don't know
if he's ever done anything for sure.

518
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:49,424
I mean, he shows me
an episode of High Chaparall,

519
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:52,177
a guy falls off a horse,
he says it's him.

520
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:56,181
You know the show The Virginian?

521
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,769
Yeah, well, there was another actor
on that show -- Gary Clarke --

522
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,688
and I looked like him a bit.

523
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:05,816
Obviously,
before I cut myself shaving.

524
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,651
Oh, I like it.

525
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:12,155
Well, damn if you ain't so sweet,
you make sugar taste just like salt.

526
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,993
Anyway, I did a lot of Virginians
doubling Gary Clarke.

527
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:19,538
And, uh, then that show
turned into The Men of Shiloh,

528
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:22,290
they brought on Lee Majors,
and I doubled him.

529
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:25,544
From that point on,
I specialized mostly in car stunts.

530
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:29,464
Yeah, I did damn near
the whole third season of Vegas.

531
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,717
I was Robert Urich's driving double.

532
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,761
And then Bob did another show -- Gavilan,

533
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,431
and he brought me 
with him on that till ...

534
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,601
And after that ...

535
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,566
Do you know any of these shows
or people I'm talking about?

536
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,276
Sorry.

537
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,820
- No.
- No.

538
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:58,702
So, how exactly does one
become a stuntman,

539
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,787
Stuntman Mike?

540
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,123
Well, in Hollywood,

541
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,043
anybody fool enough
to throw himself down a flight of stairs

542
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,045
can usually find somebody
to pay him for it.

543
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,881
But, really, I got into the business

544
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,591
the way most people
get in the stunt business.

545
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:15,427
- How's that?
- My brother got me in it.

546
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,846
- Well, who's your brother?
- Stuntman Bob.

547
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:27,522
I'm trying to get these two shows
happening in New York for November.

548
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,071
- I'm ready to blaze.
- Finally. Yeah.

549
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,823
- You need to catch up with us.
- Now the party can start.

550
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:37,908
Yep.

551
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:40,243
Anyhoo, I'm sorry.

552
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,871
Will you forgive me?

553
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:47,084
But you have to be real nice to me
for the whole rest of the time I'm here.

554
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,128
- Promise. You ready to go to the lake?
- Mm-hmm.

555
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,880
How about your little friend?
You wanna bring him?

556
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,632
I thought no boys.

557
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:55,675
If you really want him to come,
Shanna won't mind.

558
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,345
So, how about it?
Boys or just us girls?

559
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,097
Us girls.

560
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,933
Good idea.

561
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,684
Ladies.

562
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,563
Thanks.

563
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,607
Cheers, Butterfly.

564
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:17,155
"The woods are lovely, dark and deep,

565
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:22,619
"and I have promises to keep
and miles to go before I sleep.

566
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:25,831
"Did you hear me, Butterfly?

567
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:30,127
Miles to go before you sleep."

568
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,004
Sorry, Stuntman Burt --

569
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,339
Mike.

570
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:37,801
Mike. She already
broke off that dance.

571
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:40,846
Is that true?

572
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,640
Did I miss my chance?

573
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,395
Do I frighten you?

574
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,693
Is it my scar?

575
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:58,655
It's your car.

576
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,949
Ah. Yeah, I know.

577
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,784
Sorry.

578
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,870
It's my mom's car.

579
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,583
Have you been following us?

580
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,835
No. But that's what
I love about Austin.

581
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:14,004
It's just so damn small.

582
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:17,382
- You've seen this guy before?
- I saw him outside of Guero's.

583
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:20,343
And I saw you outside Guero's, too.

584
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,180
You saw my car, I saw your legs.

585
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:26,600
Now, look, I ain't stalking y'all,
but I didn't say I wasn't a wolf.

586
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,685
So you really weren't following us?

587
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,020
I'm not following you, Butterfly.

588
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:33,273
I just got lucky.

589
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:39,112
So, how about that lap dance?

590
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,031
Sorry. It was a one-time-only offer,

591
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:44,492
and she did it earlier
this evening at Anton's.

592
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,870
- No, she didn't.
- How do you know?

593
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:49,706
I'm good that way.

594
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,583
And you look a little touchéd.

595
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:54,044
- What's "touchéd"?
- Wounded slightly.

596
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,921
Why should I be wounded?

597
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:58,423
Because you expected guys
to be pestering you all night,

598
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:02,385
but from your look,
I can tell nobody pestered you at all.

599
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,930
That kind of hurt your feelings
a little bit, didn't it?

600
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:09,893
There are few things
as fetching as a bruised ego

601
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,937
on a beautiful angel.

602
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,276
So ...

603
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:23,073
how about that lap dance?

604
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:25,659
I think I'm gonna have to
give you a rain check.

605
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,789
well, since you'll be leaving
in the next couple of days,

606
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:34,668
that rain check will be worthless.

607
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:37,754
But that's okay.

608
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:40,423
I understand
if I make you uncomfortable.

609
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,260
You're still a nice girl,

610
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:46,137
and I still like you.

611
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,683
But I must warn you of something.

612
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,768
You know how people say ...

613
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,979
"You're okay in my book,"

614
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:57,357
or, "In my book, that's no good"?

615
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:02,696
Well, I actually have a book.

616
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,656
And everybody I ever meet

617
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,033
goes in this book.

618
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:11,079
And now I've met you,
and you're going in the book.

619
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:18,295
Except I'm afraid I must file you ...

620
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,465
under "chickenshit."

621
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,551
And what if I did it?

622
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:29,306
Well, I definitely couldn't file you
under "chickenshit" then, now, could I?

623
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,891
What's your name again?

624
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:32,976
Stuntman Mike.

625
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,813
Well, Stuntman Mike, I'm Butterfly.

626
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:41,693
My friend Jungle Julia over here says
that jukebox inside is pretty impressive.

627
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:44,154
- Yeah, it is.
- Yeah.

628
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:48,199
why don't you go get ready
for your lap dance?

629
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:05,300
what about "kind of cute, kind of hot,
kind of sexy, hysterically funny,

630
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,886
but not funny-looking guy
who you could fuck"

631
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,346

00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:19,285
Lookin' good, Cannonball Run!

678
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,579
He's just giving me a ride.

679
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:25,083
- Oh, no doubt.
- Have a nice ride!

680
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,878
Look, double fucks ...

681
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:34,634
uh-uh, I am not gonna fuck him.

682
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,554
I can hear you.

683
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:41,558
- He's old enough to be my dad --
- I can still hear you.

684
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:47,564
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

685
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,988
Wow, that's fucking scary.

686
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,739
Yeah, well,
I wanted it to be impressive.

687
00:42:56,824 --> 00:43:00,702
Scary tends to impress.

688
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,579
Is it safe?

689
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:05,582
Oh, it's better than safe.
It's death proof.

690
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:08,251
How do you make a car death proof?

691
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:10,128
well, that's what stuntmen do.

692
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,714
You've seen a movie
where a car gets into some smash-up

693
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:15,717
there ain't no way in hell
anybody's walking away from?

694
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:16,884
Yeah.

695
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,720
Well, how do you think they accomplish that?

696
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:21,431
CGI?

697
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:25,768
well, unfortunately, Pam, nowadays,
more often than not, you're right.

698
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,771
But back in the all-or-nothing days,
the Vanishing Point days,

699
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,024
the Dirty Mary Crazy Larry days,

700
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,942
the White Line Fever days --

701
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,737
real cars
smashing into real cars

702
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:38,615
with real dumb people
driving them.

703
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,826
So, you give the stunt team
the car you want to smash up,

704
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:44,120
take her and reinforce
that fucker everywhere,

705
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:49,542
and voilà, you got yourself
a death-proof automobile.

706
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,628
That makes sense.

707
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:54,005
I just didn't know you could
make a car death proof.

708
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:56,007
Hell, I can drive this baby
into a brick wall

709
00:43:56,091 --> 00:44:00,219
doing 125 miles an hour
just for the experience.

710
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,187
Why is your passenger seat in a box?

711
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,980
well, this is a movie car.

712
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:14,108
Sometimes when you're shooting a crash,
director wants to put a camera in the car.

713
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:16,736
You know, shoot the crash
from the inside.

714
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,656
That's where you put the camera.
They call it a crash box. Here.

715
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,992
There you go.

716
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:26,663
You know, when you asked
to drive me home,

717
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,665
you didn't mention your car
didn't have a passenger seat.

718
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:31,668
Yeah, well, actually,
I didn't ask to drive you home.

719
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:35,046
You asked me for a ride, and I said yes.
But look at the bright side, Pam.

720
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:38,174
I won't be getting fresh
putting my hand on your knee.

721
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,804
That is the bright side.

722
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:45,515
I thought so.

723
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:12,458
Well, Pam, which way you going?

724
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,377
- Left or right?
- Right.

725
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,963
Ah, that's too bad.

726
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,297
Why?

727
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:22,051
Well, because there was a 50-50 shot
on whether you'd be going left or right.

728
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,220
You see, we're both going left.

729
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,514
You could've just as easily
been going left, too,

730
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:27,724
and if that was the case,

731
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:30,268
it would've been a while
before you started getting scared.

732
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:32,812
But since you're going the other way,

733
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,772
I'm afraid ...

734
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:39,068
you're gonna have to start
getting scared ... immediately.

735
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,279
What the fuck?

736
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,748
Cocksucking motherfucker!

737
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,583
Just fucking let me out of here!

738
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:54,917
I'll fucking rip your fucking --

739
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,335
Stop the fucking car!

740
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:41,672
Okay, here's the thing.

741
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,966
I get it.

742
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:47,470
I -- I know it's a joke,
and it's super-funny.

743
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:51,599
Um, but if you just stop right now,

744
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:53,976
you know, and -- and -- and let me out,

745
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:57,188
I'll never tell anybody,
because I know it's a joke.

746
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,190
I know all about jokes.

747
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:03,444
I promise everything will be fine.

748
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:06,197
Just -- Just -- Just let me out,

749
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:08,407
please, and -- and --

750
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,326
Hey, Pam,

751
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,663
remember when I said
this car was death proof?

752
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,999
well, that wasn't a lie.

753
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:20,169
This car is 100% death proof.

754
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:23,464
Only, to get the benefit of it, honey,

755
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:26,926
you really need to be
sitting in my seat.

756
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:08,175
Now I gotta catch me
my other girlfriends.

757
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,190
No, no, no, no.

758
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:27,236
It's Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mitch and Tich.

759
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:30,239
So you got it?
Thanks, honey.

760
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,909
You're gonna play it next song, right?

761
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,411
Good boy.

762
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:38,122
Growl.

763
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:40,249
Bye-bye.

764
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,918
Who do you wanna hear?

765
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,669
Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mitch and Tich.

766
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,004
Who?

767
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:48,132
Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mitch and Tich.

768
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:49,926
Who the fuck are they?

769
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:53,971
For your information, Pete Townshend,
at one point, almost quit The Who,

770
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,474
and if he had,
he would've ended up in this group,

771
00:48:56,558 --> 00:49:00,436
thus making it Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mitch, Tich and Pete.

772
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,855
And if you ask me, he should have.

773
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:06,233

Uh, I don't remember.

796
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,486
Dr. Block.

797
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,453
Self restraints to room 310.

798
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:07,123
Self restraints to room 310.

799
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:13,420
well, what's the patient's
prognosis, Dr. Block?

800
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,798
I don't really see
it's any of your business.

801
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,883
Come on now, sis.

802
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,969
You just tell us.

803
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:22,054
How bad is he?

804
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,977
He got banged up real good.

805
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,187
Busted nose, broken collarbone,

806
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:32,314
smashed up his left index finger.

807
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,233
Is that it?

808
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:37,111
He was real lucky.

809
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,990
That'll be all?

810
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:45,035
Why, that's more than enough,
and I wanna thank you, Dr. Block.

811
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,040
Son of a bitch!

812
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:54,503
So, Pop, what do you think?

813
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:56,881
well, son number one,

814
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:59,008
what I think is so goddamn ghoulish,

815
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:01,427
I hesitate to speak it out loud.

816
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,846
Well, give it a shot.

817
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:07,183
Well, what we have here
is a case of vehicular homicide.

818
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:10,019
That old boy in there
murdered them pretty little gals.

819
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:13,898
I mean, he used a car and not a hatchet,
but they dead just the same.

820
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,277
Well, what are you gonna do?

821
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:20,362
Not a goddamn thing.

822
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:23,115
The DA says ain't no crime here.

823
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,993
Every one of them gals
was swimming in alcohol

824
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:28,204
and floating on weed.

825
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:30,581
And old Hooper in there

826
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:32,583
came out clean as a whistle.

827
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:36,587
Now, you actually think that he
premeditatedly murdered them gals?

828
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:38,505
Well, I can't prove it,

829
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:42,009
but since thinking don't cost nothing,
I can think it, and I do.

830
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:45,387
Yeah, but, Pop, he got
pretty banged up hisself.

831
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,723
Well, hell, yeah, he got banged up,
but God damn!

832
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:50,726
Them pretty little gals
look like a goddamn giant

833
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,353
chewed 'em up and spit 'em out.

834
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:53,896
Any of 'em survive?

835
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,606
Shit.

836
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:58,234
Two tons of metal,
200 miles an hour,

837
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:01,070
flesh and bone
and plain old Newton ...

838
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:03,614
They all princess died.

839
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:11,455
Why?

840
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:16,335
well, I'd guestimate
it's a sex thing.

841
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,087
The only way I can figure it.

842
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:20,256
High-velocity impact,

843
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,259
twisted metal, busted glass,

844
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:27,096
all four souls taken
exactly at the same time.

845
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:32,476
Probably the only way that
diabolical degenerate can shoot his goo.

846
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,271
Yeah, I think the only thing
we can dream of getting that bastard on

847
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:38,774
is vehicular manslaughter
for the hitchhiker in the death box.

848
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:41,777
That was just plain old goddamn
reckless endangerment.

849
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:45,489
But I got me a goddamn bartender
gonna testify

850
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:48,993
that old Stuntman Mike
didn't drink a drop all night,

851
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:52,121
and his passenger
was left stranded by her date

852
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:56,125
in the goddamn rain, no less,
and she asked him for the fucking ride.

853
00:54:56,209 --> 00:55:00,004
Now, on paper, it's gonna look like
he's just trying to help her out.

854
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:02,423
I mean, that's the way
the jury's gonna see it.

855
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:04,508
So what are you gonna do, Pop?

856
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:09,054
well, I can take it upon myself
to work the case, you know,

857
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,597
in my off hours.

858
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:13,851
Search for evidence,
you know, to prove my theory.

859
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:17,479
Alert authorities.
Dog that rotten son of a bitch.

860
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:18,856
Wherever he goes, I go.

861
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,650
Or I can spend

862
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:24,320
the same goddamn amount
of time and energy

863
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:27,156
following the NASCAR circuit.

864
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,408
Hmm. I thought about it a lot.

865
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:33,120
I think I'd have a hell of lot
happier life if I did the latter.

866
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:38,417
And just because I can't punish old ...
Frankenstein in there for what he's done,

867
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:41,462
I'm gonna tell you
like the Lord told John.

868
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:43,422
If he ever does it again,

869
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:46,842
I can make goddamn sure
he don't do it in Texas.

- So, are you on the same floor with him?

889
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,225
- Who's in whose room?
- He's in mine.

890
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:20,644
- And, so, what happened then?
- That was pretty much it.

891
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:23,939
We made out in the hall for about 10 minutes,
and then I sent him off to his room.

892
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:27,860
- So, how's The Rock as a kisser?
- Mmm, he's damn good!

893
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:30,446
He's got them mushy lips
and fingertips.

894
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,281
Mmm, I love them mushy lips.

895
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:33,449
And he's a big guy,

896
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:35,534
so he spins me around
so my back's up against him.

897
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:38,287
Then he takes his big hand,
and he puts it on my throat,

898
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:40,706
tilts my head back
and leans over me,

899
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,916
kisses me from behind.

900
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:46,253
- Damn, that sounds sexy!
- Mmm, it was sexy.

901
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:48,172
But then that was it?
You sent him off?

902
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:49,923
How'd he take it?

903
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,633
Wait a minute.
What are we doing here?

904
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:53,719
If I'm gonna power through
and pick up Zoë at the airport,

905
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,471
I need a big-ass cup of coffee.

906
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:56,555
Since you're getting that,

907
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:59,308
can you get some more vodka
and some more sugar-free Red Bull?

908
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:02,978
We didn't know you were awake.

909
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:05,063
I'm not awake. I'm asleep.

910
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:08,233
But get some more vodka
and some more sugar-free Red Bull anyway.

911
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,152

to get you bitches groceries!

00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:17,284

to get to the airport, don't you?
- Uh-huh.

914
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:18,827

get behind the wheel,

00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,704

They ain't got sugar-free Red Bull.

918
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:45,562
They got regular Red Bull
and sugar-free G.O. juice.

Oh, you best get your ass
off Kim's car.

01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:31,848
I've seen Kim sit on it before.

01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,560
Okay.

964
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:38,396
So, I think I'm in
this month's issue of Allure.

965
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:43,485
You got Allure?

966
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:45,487
Magazines by the window.

01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,591
You hot mama, you.

01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,093
See you in a second.

970
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,304
3.85. Out of 20.

971
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:17,352
And you get 15 and change back.

972
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:19,187
Thank you very much.

973
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:23,984
You know, I got other fashion magazines
for sale behind the counter.

974
01:04:26,487 --> 01:04:28,989
No, that's okay.
This'll be all.

975
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:30,866
- Thought I'd ask.
- Thanks anyway.

976
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,576
Have a good one.

977
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:38,456
I got this month's issue
of Italian Vogue.

978
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:46,089
This month's?

979
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:48,884
Listen to this.

980
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:52,971
The Circle A clerk has
this month's issue of Italian Vogue.

981
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:54,472
- No way.
- Way.

982
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:57,058
I can't believe a fucking Circle A
carries Italian Vogue.

983
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:59,811
It doesn't.
It's his own personal copy.

984
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,897
He'll let it go for 27 bucks.

985
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:03,815
Twenty-seven bucks?

986
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,276
What the fuck do you care?
We're talking about fucking per diem here.

987
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:09,279
Look, we found an issue of Italian Vogue
in Lebanon, Tennessee.

988
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:11,364
we're lucky he's not asking
for fucking Krugerrands.

989
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:13,491
I'm getting it,
and we're splitting it three ways.

990
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:14,743
What, me, you and Kim?

991
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:16,411
No, Kim doesn't give a shit
about Italian Vogue.

992
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:20,457
But Brandy will come in with us,
and if she won't, Tysla, her sister, will.

993
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:24,419
Okay. But if anybody
tears out any sheets I want,

994
01:05:24,503 --> 01:05:25,962
you gotta make color Xerox
of those pages.

995
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:27,923
And I'm not talking fucking Kinko's
here either, okay?

996
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:31,801

1010
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:40,537
It just so happens that we're all three off
duty for the next three days of shooting.

1011
01:06:40,621 --> 01:06:43,081
Fucking hell.
How does that happen?

1012
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:46,001
well, I'm doing Lindsay Lohan's makeup,
and she's off for the next three days,

1013
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:49,170
there's no stunts being filmed
during that time, so Kim's free,

1014
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:53,258
and Lee's on a "will notify"
for the next four days.

1015
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:55,176
So, how's the shoot going?

1016

Great. We're having the best time.

1017

The director, Cecil Evans,
is so much fun.

1018
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:03,018
we're making the coolest movie
and partying all the time.

01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:06,187
Hell, yeah. The next job after this one
is definitely gonna suck.

1020
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:08,231
So, let's hear it, ladies.

1021
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:10,817
Set romances.
Who's getting it off?

1022
01:07:10,901 --> 01:07:13,111
That would be Lee and Toolbox.

1023
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:16,406
Oh, Toolbox.
Name sounds promising.

1024
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:18,616
- He's a grip.
- What he is is a pervert.

1025
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:22,245
Well, he just keeps sounding
better and better.

1026
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:24,414
What's his perversion?

1027
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:28,293
He likes to watch me pee.

1028
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:32,881
Lee is sitting on the toilet,
and Toolbox is watching her pee.

1029
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:35,050
P-I-S-S-I-N-G.

1030
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,178
Yeah, but not no more.

1031
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:41,056
Now she's getting it on with The Rock.

1032
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,475
- You're having one off with The Rock?
- Not the real Rock.

1033
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:44,893
He's this electrician named Bruce.

1034
01:07:44,977 --> 01:07:47,270
And Kim started calling him The Rock,
'cause he kind of looks like The Rock,

1035
01:07:47,354 --> 01:07:49,064
so now we all just call him The Rock.

1036
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:50,732
Oh, yeah.
This is an all-star crew.

1037
01:07:50,816 --> 01:07:52,484
We got a guy who looks like Nick Cage

1038
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:54,110
and a guy who looks
like Pee-wee Herman, too.

1039
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:56,905
Kim, dick department.
Let's hear it.

1040
01:07:56,989 --> 01:07:58,615
Mm-mm. No dick this trip.

1041
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:00,658
I got a man.

1042
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:03,787
- How long have you had this boyfriend?
- About three months.

1043
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:05,413
Who'd you steal him from?

1044
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:07,624
- Nobody.
- Kim!

1045
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:09,084
Wha -- What?

1046
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:11,294
He totally had a girlfriend.

1047
01:08:11,378 --> 01:08:14,631
All of Kim's boyfriends start out
as somebody else's boyfriend.

1048
01:08:14,715 --> 01:08:16,674
I did not steal him.

1049
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,927
I didn't steal any of them.

1050
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:21,930
They just ... jumped ship.

1051
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:26,101
So, what's your story, Abernathy?

1052
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:28,103
Oh, Abbie's got the big kahuna.

1053
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:31,272
I had a set crush on Cecil.

1054
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:34,109
Set crush? Nigga, please!
You were his set wife.

1055
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:36,945
"Were" and "had"
being the key words here.

1056
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:39,155
Bitch, you two are still
into each other, and you know it.

1057
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,199
Yeah, well,
if he's so in love with me,

1058
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:44,994
then whey did he fuck
Daryl Hannah's stand-in?

1059
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:47,622
Ho-ho-ho!

1060
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:51,543
Yes, men are dogs.
Oh, it's so funny!

1061
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:53,711
Oh, it's so funny!

1062
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:55,672
Oh, stop acting all hurt.
Your ass just mad.

1063
01:08:55,756 --> 01:08:58,133
Yeah, he's a stand-in fucker.

1064
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:00,635
Bitch, you need to get over that shit.
That was two weeks ago.

1065
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:04,305
Oh, well,
now that you put it like that.

1066
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,808
Oh, I haven't told you
the best part.

1067
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:10,103
He fucked her on my birthday.

1068
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:12,814
Oh, that's a horse of a different color.

1069
01:09:12,898 --> 01:09:14,274
Thank you.

1070
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:15,984
Did he know it was your birthday?

1071
01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:18,987
He's the director.
He's kind of busy.

1072
01:09:19,071 --> 01:09:23,199
He ate a piece of my birthday cake
and he got me a present.

1073
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:25,326
Yeah, I think he knew.

1074
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:28,371
Well, what did he get you?

1075
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:33,543
He made me a tape.

1076
01:09:33,627 --> 01:09:35,253
He made you a tape?

1077
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:36,754
- Yeah.
- Wait.

1078
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,840
He didn't burn you a CD.
He made you a tape?

1079
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:42,260
- Yeah.
- Oh, that is so romantic.

1080
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:45,221
Yes. I know what you're gonna say,
so don't even go there.

1081
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:47,348
That sounds like the test
of true love to me.

1082
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:49,767
Look, I know you guys like him.

1083
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:53,980
He's likable, but he fucked
another woman on my birthday.

1084
01:09:54,064 --> 01:09:55,690
How can you not be on my side?

1085
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:57,775
well, I admit, that sounds bad.

1086
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,194
It is bad!

1087
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:02,197
It just sounds like
there's a little more to it than that.

1088
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:04,741
- Were you two fucking?
- Hell, no.

1089
01:10:04,825 --> 01:10:06,784
Hello. Is your name Abernathy?

1090
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:08,369
Sorry.

1091
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:12,248
The answer to your question
is no, of course not.

1092
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:15,251
What do you mean,
"No, of course not"?

1093
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:19,505
The reason Cecil hasn't had a girlfriend
in six years is because girls will fuck him.

1094
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:22,884
And if you fuck Cecil,
you don't become one of his girlfriends.

1095
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:26,638
Not to say I want
to be his girlfriend,

1096
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:29,224
but if I did want to be his girlfriend,

1097
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:31,851
if I fucked him,
I wouldn't be his girlfriend.

1098
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:34,312
I'd be one of his regulars.

1099
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:37,398
And I'm just getting
too fucking old for that shit.

1100
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,901
Have you let him do anything?

1101
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:41,402
Yes!

1102
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:44,364
I've let him give me a foot massage,

1103
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:47,742
and when we go to the movies,
I've let him hold my hand.

1104
01:10:47,826 --> 01:10:50,995
Bitch, you might be acting
like you 12 years old,

1105
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,705
but he just acting like a man.

1106
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,874
You need to break
that nigga off a piece.

1107
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:56,960
Let me get this straight.

1108
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:59,045
- You're not fucking him ...
- Mm-mm.

1109
01:10:59,129 --> 01:11:00,546
- You're not sucking him ...
- Mm-mm.

1110
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:04,425
you're not giving him any tongue,
but Daryl Hannah's stand-in is.

1111
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,636
Okay, can we just take
my sex life off the table?

1112
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:11,266
Actually, uh, it was Cecil's sex life
that was on the table and your lack of one.

1113
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,434
Ohhh!

1114
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:19,983
Fuck both of you
and your little high five.

1115
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:24,737
Before you can claim a nigga,
you got to claim a nigga,

1116
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:27,323
and you can start by giving
that motherfucker a hand job

1117
01:11:27,408 --> 01:11:28,783
in the back of the van on Tuesday.

1118
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:30,493
I'm not gonna do that.

1119
01:11:30,577 --> 01:11:33,246
I know you won't.
But you know who will.

1120
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:36,291
The bitch that ends up living
in that big-ass mansion of his.

1121
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:40,837
Now, I gotta say, I haven't entirely agreed
with everything Kim said, but it is true:

1122
01:11:40,921 --> 01:11:43,298
If you stretch shit out
like you have with Cecil,

1123
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:45,466
and you suddenly get dirty on them,

1124
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:49,137
it blows their mind.

1125
01:11:49,221 --> 01:11:52,807
So, Zoë, Kim and I are in the Philippines
at an outdoor rave.

1126
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:56,144
- What were you working on?
- Three Kicks to the Head, Part Three.

1127
01:11:56,228 --> 01:11:59,731
And, admittedly,
we're a little fucked-up.

1128
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:02,692
- Cheers to that.
- Word.

1129
01:12:02,776 --> 01:12:04,193
Cheers.

1130
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,571
So, Zoë,

1131
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,489
the genius,

1132
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:11,326
wants to take a picture of me.

1133
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:14,954
It's dark as hell,
and you can't see shit.

1134
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:17,415
So she's got her camera
and keeps saying,

1135
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:19,876
"Step back a little," so I do.

1136
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:24,339
Then, "A little further,"
so I step back a little further.

1137
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:27,717
Then, "A little more," so I do.

1138
01:12:27,801 --> 01:12:30,678
Then I realize I'm right at the edge

1139
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:33,348
of a seven-foot concrete ditch

1140
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:38,353
with God knows how many rocks
and broken bottles and rats in it,

1141
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:41,731
and if I fell in that fucking thing,
I'd probably would've broken my fucking neck.

1142
01:12:41,815 --> 01:12:45,735
So I'm yelling at her,
"Zoë, you almost killed me!"

1143
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:51,449
So we laugh about it
and walk a little further,

1144
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:54,118
and Zoë starts fucking around,

1145
01:12:54,286 --> 01:12:59,874
and damn if she doesn't fall
in the fucking ditch.

1146
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:02,210
Nice. Nice.

1147
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:05,213
Thank you. Yep. Thank you.

1148
01:13:05,297 --> 01:13:08,007
I remember taking a step
and looking down.

1149
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:11,219
Just as I'm thinking,
"There's that ditch Abbie was talking about,"

1150
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:13,805
bam, I'm in the fucking ditch,
you know?

1151
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:15,390
What happened?

1152
01:13:15,474 --> 01:13:18,810
what, with Zoë the cat?
Nothing.

1153
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:20,686
If I fell in that fucking thing,

1154
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:22,772
they would've had to
helicopter me out of there.

1155
01:13:22,856 --> 01:13:25,400
Zoë just lands on her feet.

1156
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:28,903
But then, later, I started feeling
a little bad about myself.

1157
01:13:28,987 --> 01:13:32,782
Zoë falls in the ditch,
and it's nothing.

1158
01:13:32,866 --> 01:13:34,617
We're laughing about it.

1159
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:36,828
If I fell in that fucking thing,

1160
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:38,746
I probably would've been
fucking paralyzed.

1161
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:40,415
Oh, honey, you can't think like that.

1162
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:43,042
You know, we all have
our individual talents,

1163
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:44,794
and that just happens
to be one of Zoë's.

1164
01:13:44,878 --> 01:13:46,629
- Yeah.
- Well ...

1165
01:13:46,713 --> 01:13:49,632
physically speaking, Zoë is amazing.

1166
01:13:49,716 --> 01:13:53,094
I mean, agility, reflexes, nimbleness.

1167
01:13:53,178 --> 01:13:56,013
There's few human beings
that can fuck with Zoë on that front.

1168
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,307
Oh, Kim, I like you, too.

1169
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:01,269
Having said that,

1170
01:14:01,353 --> 01:14:04,063
before you get too envious
of Zoë's prowess,

1171
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:06,899
you're missing the most important
part of that story.

1172
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:10,278
You didn't fall in the ditch,
Zoë did.

1173
01:14:10,362 --> 01:14:14,240
Zoë even knew there was a ditch there
because you told her,

1174
01:14:14,324 --> 01:14:16,367
and she still fell in.

1175
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:19,454
So, Lee's right.
We all have our talents.

1176
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:22,707
Hey, I resemble that remark.

1177
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:28,087
So, Kim,
you still pack a roscoe?

1178
01:14:31,216 --> 01:14:33,301
Check it out, bitch.

1179
01:14:33,385 --> 01:14:35,720
- Ooh, nice one, mate.
- I know this.

1180
01:14:35,804 --> 01:14:38,723
- What's a roscoe?
- A roscoe is a pistol.

1181
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:41,267
- You carry a gun?
- Uh-huh.

1182
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:44,187
- You have a license to carry it?
- Yeah.

1183
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:47,565
when I became a Secret Service agent,
they gave me a license.

1184
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:50,067
Oh, I didn't know you were --

1185
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:55,615
Okay, I didn't say it, all right?
Stop looking at me. I didn't say it.

1186
01:14:55,699 --> 01:14:57,492
God!

1187
01:14:57,576 --> 01:14:59,494
Did you know Kim carried a gun?

1188
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:03,581
Yes. Now, do I approve? No.

1189
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:05,666
Do I know? Yes.

1190
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:09,545
Look, I don't know what
futuristic utopia you live in,

1191
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:12,340
but the world I live in,
a bitch need a gun.

1192
01:15:12,424 --> 01:15:16,260
You can't get around the fact
that people who carry guns

1193
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:18,846
tend to get shot
more than people who don't.

1194
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:21,182
And you can't get around the fact
that if I go down

1195
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:23,893
to the laundry room in my building
at midnight enough times,

1196
01:15:23,977 --> 01:15:25,811
I might get my ass raped.

1197
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:27,688
Don't do your laundry at midnight.

1198
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:31,317
Fuck that. I wanna do my laundry
whenever the fuck I wanna do my laundry.

1199
01:15:31,401 --> 01:15:34,362
There are other things
you can carry other than a gun.

1200
01:15:34,446 --> 01:15:35,905
Pepper spray.

1201
01:15:35,989 --> 01:15:40,159
Uh, motherfucker try to rape me,
I don't wanna give him a skin rash.

1202
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:42,578
I wanna shut that nigga down.

1203
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:46,082
How about a knife at least?

1204
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:49,335
Yeah. You know what happens
to motherfuckers carry knives?

1205
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:52,380
They get shot!

1206
01:15:52,464 --> 01:15:55,216
Look, if I ever become
a famous actress,

1207
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,759
I won't carry a gun.

1208
01:15:56,843 --> 01:15:59,345
I'll hire me a do-dirt nigga,
and he'll carry the gun.

1209
01:15:59,429 --> 01:16:01,264
And when shit goes down,
I'll sit back and laugh.

1210
01:16:01,348 --> 01:16:04,183
But until that day,
it's wild West, motherfucker.

1211
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:07,603
So, Zoë, you thought about
what you want to do first?

1212
01:16:09,022 --> 01:16:12,650
It just so happens
I know exactly what I wanna do.

1213
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:14,402
Oh, really?

1214
01:16:14,486 --> 01:16:16,320
And what would that be?

1215
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,573
To me, there's no point
in being in America

1216
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:20,741
unless you can drive
a Detroit muscle car.

1217
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:22,910
And I wanna drive a Dodge Challenger.

1218
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:26,372
Fuck me swinging, balls out.

1219
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:30,918
Um, well, I guess we 
can talk to Transpo.

1220
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:33,296
But does it have to be
a Dodge Challenger?

1221
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:34,589
Not just that.

1222
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:38,801
It has to be a 1970 Dodge Challenger
with a 440 engine.

1223
01:16:41,513 --> 01:16:44,724
How in the fuck do 
you expect to do that?

1224
01:16:44,808 --> 01:16:46,601
No worries, mate.

1225
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:48,686
I've got it all worked out.

1226
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:51,814
When I knew I was coming here,
I went online and found out

1227
01:16:51,898 --> 01:16:55,651
that the local paper here in Tennessee
is the Lebanon News Sentinel.

1228
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:57,612
- So, back home --
- I'm sorry. Where's home?

1229
01:16:57,696 --> 01:16:59,322
Australia, right?

1230
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:03,075
What do you mean by that, mate?

1231
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:06,454
Zoë's from New Zealand,
and you never --

1232
01:17:06,538 --> 01:17:10,207
I repeat, never --
call a Kiwi an Aussie.

1233
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:14,086
That is, unless you want
your ass kicked.

1234
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:16,213
I'm so sorry.
I really am.

1235
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:19,008
Oh, it's okay.

1236
01:17:19,092 --> 01:17:22,345
we're just taking the piss
out of you, mate.

1237
01:17:22,429 --> 01:17:25,473
Auckland, to answer your question.

1238
01:17:25,557 --> 01:17:28,351
Anyway, I subscribed
to the local paper a month ago.

1239
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:31,937
Now, why the fuck you want a local
redneck newspaper in New Zealand?

1240
01:17:32,022 --> 01:17:34,523
Pipe down, and I'll tell you.

1241
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,484
I've been getting the paper
for the last month,

1242
01:17:36,568 --> 01:17:39,195
and I've been checking the classified
at the back, looking at cars for sale.

1243
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:41,906
So, as of yesterday,

1244
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:44,241
for sale, in this town,

1245
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:47,495
some dude is selling a stock
1970 Dodge Challenger

1246
01:17:47,579 --> 01:17:51,457
with a 440 engine
and a white paint job.

1247
01:17:51,541 --> 01:17:54,210
And you wanna buy it?

1248
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:58,339
Kim, I may be stupid,
but I'm not bloody stupid.

1249
01:17:58,423 --> 01:18:02,176
I wanna say I wanna buy it,
so he'll let me test-drive it.

1250
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:05,638
A 1970 Dodge Challenger
with a white paint job.

1251
01:18:05,722 --> 01:18:08,766
- Oh, uh, Kowalski.
- Kowalski from Vanishing Point.

1252
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:11,352
- Mate, it's a fucking classic!
- Mmm, I get it.

1253
01:18:11,436 --> 01:18:13,688
If I can get this guy
to let me drive it without him,

1254
01:18:13,772 --> 01:18:16,315
I will blow the doors off that bitch.

1255
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,276
- What's Vanishing Point?
- Oh, God.

1256
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:21,404
"What's Vanishing Point?"

1257
01:18:21,488 --> 01:18:24,532
Abs, I'm supposed to be
the illiterate one.

1258
01:18:24,616 --> 01:18:27,326
It's just one of the best
American movies ever made.

1259
01:18:27,411 --> 01:18:31,831
Actually, Zoë, most girls
wouldn't know Vanishing Point.

1260
01:18:31,915 --> 01:18:34,500
Excuse me. "Most girls"?

1261
01:18:34,584 --> 01:18:36,460
What the fuck are you two?

1262
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:39,714
Yeah, well, we're gearheads.
Of course we watched it.

1263
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:41,841
Y'all grew up watching
that Pretty in Pink shit.

1264
01:18:41,925 --> 01:18:44,552
Oh, I like Pretty in Pink.

1265
01:18:44,636 --> 01:18:47,138
what, so you didn't watch
John Hughes movies?

1266
01:18:47,222 --> 01:18:49,223
Of course I did.
I'm a girl.

1267
01:18:49,307 --> 01:18:51,350
But I also watched car shit, too.

1268
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:54,019
- Vanishing Point, Dirty Mary Crazy Larry ...
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1269
01:18:54,104 --> 01:18:55,730
Gone in 60 Seconds --

1270
01:18:55,814 --> 01:18:58,441
The real one,
not that Angelina Jolie bullshit.

1271
01:18:58,525 --> 01:19:00,735
We have an outdoors theater
in Auckland.

1272
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:03,404
It plays Vanishing Point,
Big Wednesday,

1273
01:19:03,488 --> 01:19:06,073
all the classics.

1274
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,382
What do you horny gals want?

1275
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:30,389
Hey, you got a 1970
Dodge Challenger for sale?

1276
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:32,767
Right up here, ladies.

1277
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:49,533
This shit is off the fucking hook!

1278
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:53,287
Fucking legendary, mate.

1279
01:19:54,372 --> 01:19:57,625
Sweet ass. Well, if you'll
excuse me for a moment,

1280
01:19:57,709 --> 01:19:59,835
I'd just like to have a word alone
with my business associate.

1281
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,254
- You ladies take your time.
- Okay.

1282
01:20:04,716 --> 01:20:06,217
Mmm.

1283
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:11,055
What are you waiting for?
Ask him to let you drive it by yourself.

1284
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:13,933
I -- I intend to, but first,
I need to ask you something.

1285
01:20:14,017 --> 01:20:15,267
What?

1286
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:20,272
If he lets us take it out on our own,
I wanna play ship's mast.

1287
01:20:20,357 --> 01:20:22,191
- Oh, hell, no!
- Would you keep it down?

1288
01:20:22,275 --> 01:20:24,485
- Ain't no way I'm doing ship's mast.
- For Christ sakes --

1289
01:20:24,569 --> 01:20:26,445
- Don't blaspheme.
- Sorry.

1290
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:29,448
Now, what did you say
after the last time?

1291
01:20:29,533 --> 01:20:32,660
- Look, I know what I said --
- What did you say?

1292
01:20:32,744 --> 01:20:35,830
- I know I said we shouldn't do this again --
- No. You didn't say we shouldn't.

1293
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:37,665
You said we ain't ever
gonna do that again.

1294
01:20:37,749 --> 01:20:39,834
- Yeah, but --
- "But," my ass!

1295
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:42,920
You said not only are we never
gonna play ship's mast again,

1296
01:20:43,004 --> 01:20:45,881
but you also said if you ever do
what you trying to do now

1297
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:48,425
to not only refuse,
but that I had permission

1298
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:51,053
to physically restrain
your ass if necessary.

1299
01:20:51,137 --> 01:20:53,389
Now, did you
or did you not say that?

1300
01:20:53,473 --> 01:20:55,182
- Well --
- No, no, no, no.

1301
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:57,059
Answer the question,
motherfucker.

1302
01:20:57,143 --> 01:20:58,853
Did you or did you not say that?

1303
01:20:58,937 --> 01:21:01,063
Yes, I said that.
However --

1304
01:21:01,147 --> 01:21:02,523
Whatever with your "however."

1305
01:21:02,607 --> 01:21:06,569
Look, I know I said it,
and I know I meant it --

1306
01:21:06,653 --> 01:21:07,653
Damn skippy you meant it.

1307
01:21:07,737 --> 01:21:10,614
Yeah, but when I said it,
I didn't mean in America.

1308
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:12,700
- Oh, nigga, please!
- Really --

1309
01:21:12,784 --> 01:21:14,702
I meant we should never play
ship's mast again

1310
01:21:14,786 --> 01:21:16,871
in New Zealand or Australia.

1311
01:21:16,955 --> 01:21:18,956
You are such a liar.

1312
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,709
Look, I know what I said
when I said it.

1313
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:24,211
But when I said it, I didn't know
I'd ever come to America.

1314
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:26,964
And when I said it, if I had known
I was going to come to America

1315
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:28,716
and had the opportunity
to play ship's mast

1316
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,719
with a fucking
Vanishing Point Challenger,

1317
01:21:31,803 --> 01:21:34,013
I would've added a "however."

1318
01:21:34,097 --> 01:21:35,931
Right?

1319
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:43,898
Okay, oddly enough,
I actually understood that.

1320
01:21:43,982 --> 01:21:48,193
However, just because you
talked yourself into some stupid shit

1321
01:21:48,278 --> 01:21:50,487
doesn't mean I have lost
my goddamn mind.

1322
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:53,365
You need two people
to play ship's mast, and I ain't playing.

1323
01:22:01,124 --> 01:22:03,125
I'll be your best friend.

1324
01:22:03,209 --> 01:22:06,253
I don't need me no best friend
lives on the other side of planet Earth.

1325
01:22:06,338 --> 01:22:09,089
- I'll crack your back.
- You'll crack it anyway.

1326
01:22:09,174 --> 01:22:11,759
Well, of course I'll crack it anyway.

1327
01:22:11,843 --> 01:22:15,638
But now, while I'm here,
I'll be your back-cracking slave.

1328
01:22:15,722 --> 01:22:18,515
Whenever you want it, you got it.
You don't even have to ask for it.

1329
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,434
You just order me to do it.
Just be, like ...

1330
01:22:20,518 --> 01:22:22,770
"Bitch, get over here and get busy."

1331
01:22:29,361 --> 01:22:31,362
- You crack my back,
you'll give me foot massages ...
- Mm-hmm. Mmm.

1332
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:34,698
and after a shower,
you put moisturizer on my butt.

1333
01:22:34,783 --> 01:22:37,618
Deal.

1334
01:22:37,702 --> 01:22:40,454
So, we're gonna see if this guy'll
let us take the car out without him.

1335
01:22:40,538 --> 01:22:43,540
If he does, you wait here with Lee,
and we'll be back in a moment.

1336
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:45,125
What?

1337
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:48,128
I said, we're gonna see if this guy'll
let us take the car out without him --

1338
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:49,797
I heard what you said.

1339
01:22:49,881 --> 01:22:53,175
I just can't believe what you said.

1340
01:22:54,552 --> 01:22:56,178
You know, you two got
some fucking balls.

1341
01:22:56,262 --> 01:22:57,680
What?

1342
01:22:57,764 --> 01:22:59,515
Don't play dumbass with me.

1343
01:22:59,599 --> 01:23:01,225
I've been up all night.

1344
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:04,603
I'm still a little drunk
and I have a hangover.

1345
01:23:04,688 --> 01:23:08,065
I should be in my hotel room asleep,
not fucking around here on Tobacco Road.

1346
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:12,027
But because Zoë wanted to drive
some fucking Vanishing Point car, I'm here.

1347
01:23:12,112 --> 01:23:15,197
Now you two got the balls
to ask me -- no, scratch that --

1348
01:23:15,281 --> 01:23:18,325
tell me I gotta go make
conversation with Tom Joad

1349
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:20,369
while the cool kids
get to go out and play?

1350
01:23:20,453 --> 01:23:22,246
Bullshit on that.

1351
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:24,540
- It ain't like that.
- Then what's it like, Kim?

1352
01:23:24,624 --> 01:23:26,250
You guys are our collateral.

1353
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:28,711
He is never gonna go for it
if we all go.

1354
01:23:28,795 --> 01:23:32,631
I really think one human being
will be collateral enough.

1355
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:34,842
You're not gonna wanna do
what we're doing.

1356
01:23:34,926 --> 01:23:36,468
What, drive a car?

1357
01:23:36,553 --> 01:23:38,637
- Mmm.
- We're doing more than that.

1358
01:23:38,722 --> 01:23:40,556
what, drive it fast?

1359
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:43,434
We're doing more than that.

1360
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:45,853
Actually,
we're paying you a compliment,

1361
01:23:45,937 --> 01:23:48,063
'cause we gonna do
some stupid shit.

1362
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:52,484
But that's okay. We're stunt people.
We ain't got good sense.

1363
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:53,652
But you got good sense,

1364
01:23:53,737 --> 01:23:56,363
and anybody with good sense
ain't gonna wanna do what we're doing.

1365
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:58,073
How do you know
I don't wanna do it?

1366
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:01,577
- 'Cause you're a mom.
- Yeah.

1367
01:24:04,622 --> 01:24:07,041
You know, we're supposed
to be this big posse,

1368
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:08,542
but that's the excuse you guys use

1369
01:24:08,626 --> 01:24:11,045
whenever you want
to exclude me from something.

1370
01:24:11,129 --> 01:24:16,050
So, what is it you two daredevils
are doing that I'm just so uncool,

1371
01:24:16,134 --> 01:24:18,385
I couldn't possibly understand?

1372
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:21,055
You know,
we're kind of conning this guy,

1373
01:24:21,139 --> 01:24:24,767
so maybe it's best that we don't go
into detail about it while he's watching us.

1374
01:24:24,851 --> 01:24:29,563
Besides, he's probably not
gonna let us do it anyway.

1375
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:36,278
Okay. How about this?

1376
01:24:36,362 --> 01:24:37,488
I'll talk him into it.

1377
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:39,490
But if I talk him into it, I go along.

1378
01:24:40,825 --> 01:24:44,078
- How you gonna do that?
- Eh, that's my problem.

1379
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:46,121
But don't worry.

1380
01:24:46,206 --> 01:24:48,332
He'll say yes.

1381
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:50,084
What are you gonna do,
blow him?

1382
01:24:50,168 --> 01:24:53,087
No!

1383
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:55,672
I'm gonna insinuate
that Lee's gonna blow him.

1384
01:24:59,594 --> 01:25:01,762
That's good.

1385
01:25:01,846 --> 01:25:04,014
Not really.

1386
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:07,309
But let me handle it.
We got a deal?

1387
01:25:11,397 --> 01:25:13,107
Okay, Mommy, listen up.

1388
01:25:13,191 --> 01:25:15,359
You wanna hang with the cool kids,

1389
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:17,111
you got to be cool.

1390
01:25:17,195 --> 01:25:18,695
we take you along,
you don't say shit.

1391
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:19,780
You don't even say crap.

1392
01:25:19,864 --> 01:25:21,532
You just sit in the back,
and I don't wanna hear

1393
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:22,866
a peep out of your ass,
you understand?

1394
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:24,326
- Got it.
- I'm serious now.

1395
01:25:24,410 --> 01:25:26,245
You start nagging us,
we're pulling over to the side of the road,

1396
01:25:26,329 --> 01:25:28,288
kicking your ass out
and picking you up later.

1397
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:30,207
Agreed.

1398
01:25:33,878 --> 01:25:36,797
Okay. Go work your magic.

1399
01:25:43,304 --> 01:25:45,139
- Hello, sir.
- Hello!

1400
01:25:45,223 --> 01:25:46,640
- Hello. What's your name?
- Jasper.

1401
01:25:46,724 --> 01:25:48,350
Hello, Jasper.
I'm Abernathy.

1402
01:25:48,434 --> 01:25:50,060
- Aber -- what?
- Abernathy.

1403
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:52,521
- What's your first name?
- That is my first name.

1404
01:25:52,605 --> 01:25:54,231
What kind of first name is that?

1405
01:25:54,315 --> 01:25:56,150
You know what?
Just call me Abbie.

1406
01:25:56,234 --> 01:25:58,694
Okay, Abbie.

1407
01:25:58,778 --> 01:26:01,488
Jasper, we were wondering
if my friends and I

1408
01:26:01,573 --> 01:26:03,740
could take the car out
for a little test-drive out on our own.

1409
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:05,492
You know, just to see
if we're comfortable in it.

1410
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:07,327
Why would I do
something stupid like that?

1411
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:09,705
To better sell your automobile.

1412
01:26:09,789 --> 01:26:11,999
How do I know y'all ain't
just gonna steal it?

1413
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:14,334
Four reasons, actually.

1414
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:16,545
One, we're not thieves.

1415
01:26:16,629 --> 01:26:19,339
Two, that would be rude.

1416
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:21,550
Three, we're staying
at the Days Inn in town.

1417
01:26:21,634 --> 01:26:23,385
You can call the hotel,
check with management.

1418
01:26:23,469 --> 01:26:25,137
We're registered
for the next month.

1419
01:26:25,221 --> 01:26:27,181
Actually, Zoë's not.

1420
01:26:27,265 --> 01:26:29,933
But Kim and I are,
so we're totally track-downable.

1421
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:31,727
Who's Kim? The colored girl?

1422
01:26:32,812 --> 01:26:36,190
Yes. Kim would be
the girl of color.

1423
01:26:36,274 --> 01:26:38,901
And reason number four,
and the most important,

1424
01:26:38,985 --> 01:26:41,653
while we're taking the car out
for a little spin,

1425
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:44,698
that'll give you a better opportunity
to get acquainted

1426
01:26:44,782 --> 01:26:48,160
with our other friend, Lee.

1427
01:26:51,331 --> 01:26:53,707
Why does she look kind of familiar?

1428
01:26:53,791 --> 01:26:56,668
That would be because
she's a famous actress.

1429
01:26:56,753 --> 01:26:58,754
Oh.

1430
01:26:58,838 --> 01:27:00,214
Why is she dressed like that?

1431
01:27:00,298 --> 01:27:03,425
well, you see, we're making
a Hollywood movie in town,

1432
01:27:03,509 --> 01:27:06,553
and it's a cheerleader movie,
and she's one of the cheerleaders.

1433
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:08,388
What's a cheerleader movie?

1434
01:27:08,473 --> 01:27:11,016
A movie about cheerleaders.

1435
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:12,434
Is it a porno movie?

1436
01:27:13,937 --> 01:27:16,605
Yes, it is.

1437
01:27:16,689 --> 01:27:19,274
But don't mention it.

1438
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:21,652
She's shy.

1439
01:27:24,405 --> 01:27:27,741
Lee, this is Jasper.
Jasper, Lee.

1440
01:27:27,825 --> 01:27:29,826
Now, you two kids
stay out of trouble.

1441
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:33,038
Hey, good-lookin',
be back to pick you up later.

1442
01:27:33,122 --> 01:27:34,957
Ta-ta!

1443
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:46,260
Gulp.

1444
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:03,568
You thinking what I'm thinking?

1445
01:28:03,653 --> 01:28:05,279
I think I'm thinking it.

1446
01:28:05,363 --> 01:28:06,822
What are you and you thinking?

1447
01:28:06,906 --> 01:28:10,242
I'm thinking we told your ass
to shut the fuck up.

1448
01:28:13,329 --> 01:28:15,497
- Where y'all going?
- You stay put.

1449
01:28:15,581 --> 01:28:17,541
I gotta take a --

1450
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:36,935
So, you ready to do this?

1451
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:38,437
You sure?

1452
01:28:38,521 --> 01:28:41,773
well, I always don't wanna do it
right before I'm gonna do it.

1453
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:42,858
You know what I mean?

1454
01:28:42,942 --> 01:28:45,360
Yeah, I know what you mean,
'cause I don't wanna do it.

1455
01:28:45,445 --> 01:28:47,571
- Kim ...
- I'm just saying.

1456
01:28:47,655 --> 01:28:49,323
Look, if you're gonna take
the piss out of it --

1457
01:28:49,407 --> 01:28:51,033
I'm just saying.

1458
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:54,578
You wanna start out on top?

1459
01:28:55,663 --> 01:28:59,499
Practically doesn't count
if you start on the top.

1460
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:06,381
Here are your gloves.

1461
01:29:12,722 --> 01:29:15,640
No, no, no, no.
I'm wearing the jacket.

1462
01:29:15,725 --> 01:29:17,434
This is my jacket.

1463
01:29:17,518 --> 01:29:21,897
Um, ain't you 'posed to be
my slave or some shit?

1464
01:29:21,981 --> 01:29:25,025
- Come on.
- I'm the one who's on the fucking bonnet!

1465
01:29:25,109 --> 01:29:28,070
"Bonnet," my ass.
You on the hood.

1466
01:29:36,704 --> 01:29:39,039
Y'all, I think I hear a car coming!

1467
01:29:39,123 --> 01:29:40,749
Give me your belt.

1468
01:29:40,833 --> 01:29:42,250
Oh.

1469
01:29:44,921 --> 01:29:47,881
But this is my cute shit.

1470
01:29:47,965 --> 01:29:49,091
- Well --
- Fuck that.

1471
01:29:49,175 --> 01:29:51,635
Get Abernathy's belt.

1472
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:53,720
Fine. We'll use Abbie's belt.

1473
01:29:58,684 --> 01:30:01,103
- Give me your belt.
- No.

1474
01:30:01,187 --> 01:30:03,563
- Prada.
- Come on, give her the belt.

1475
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:05,565
Magic word.

1476
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:07,734
Please give her the belt.

1477
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:10,404
Just 'cause you asked nicely.

1478
01:30:13,157 --> 01:30:16,410
- It's nice to be nice, Kim!
- Whatever.

1479
01:30:16,494 --> 01:30:17,661
You know what?

1480
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:20,914
Don't even fucking think about asking me
next time you want me to do your hair.

1481
01:30:20,998 --> 01:30:21,998
Your ass gonna do it.

1482
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:23,417
Yeah, and you'll ask
"pretty please," bitch,

1483
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:25,252
because that's what you do
when no one else is looking.

1484
01:30:25,336 --> 01:30:26,420
You ain't that fucking hard.

1485
01:30:26,504 --> 01:30:27,629
I ain't getting that shit.

1486
01:30:27,713 --> 01:30:30,173
Abernathy, don't get
on my nerves right now.

1487
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:31,299
I got shit on my mind.

1488
01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:33,009
Ooh!

1489
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:35,095
You know, I ain't six.

1490
01:30:48,943 --> 01:30:50,777
It's cold. Can we roll up
one of these windows?

1491
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:53,113
No.

1492
01:30:53,197 --> 01:30:56,700
Okay, Abernathy.
Check this out.

1493
01:31:08,379 --> 01:31:10,547
What the fuck are you guys doing?

1494
01:31:18,848 --> 01:31:20,849
What does that mean?

1495
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:24,644
Whoa.

1496
01:31:28,774 --> 01:31:31,485
Faster, you black bitch! Faster!

1497
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:41,495
Is that fast enough 
for your bony ass?

1498
01:31:41,579 --> 01:31:43,622
Whoohoo!

1499
01:31:43,706 --> 01:31:45,999
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

1500
01:31:49,879 --> 01:31:52,422
Abernathy, get your ass up here.

1501
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:01,348
All righty.

1502
01:32:01,432 --> 01:32:04,226
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1503
01:32:15,321 --> 01:32:17,531
Go, go, go!

1504
01:32:17,615 --> 01:32:20,283
Check it out, bitch.
You want it fucking faster?

1505
01:33:35,818 --> 01:33:39,529
- Oh, my God.
- What the fuck? Shit!

1506
01:33:42,116 --> 01:33:44,075
Zoë!

1507
01:33:45,786 --> 01:33:47,662
Damn it!

1508
01:33:55,504 --> 01:33:56,630
Now.

1509
01:33:57,965 --> 01:33:59,174
Did you do something to him?

1510
01:33:59,258 --> 01:34:01,384
- Did you say something?
- Nothing! Nothing!

1511
01:34:01,469 --> 01:34:02,594
Shit!
