00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:54,388
She was furious with me
because if! Had my law degree,

3
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:56,641
I could have represented us.

4
00:00:56,724 --> 00:01:01,395
The jury ruled against me.
I told my lawyer! Considered suicide.

5
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,232
I drove home from nyack,
and guess what?

6
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:06,817
She had left me.
I recall almost a sigh of relief...

7
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:10,363
Somehow it made
a lasting impression on her life.

8
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:13,324
My first child came easy enough.

9
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:18,663
But with Patricia they had to open me up
under anesthesia.

10
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:21,624
I've often thought that perhaps
the reason...

11
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:26,629
I told them when I got here,
"okay, I explored the criminal lifestyle."

12
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:29,423
But I was an altar boy,
for Christ's sake.

13
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:33,719
Moltisanti is a religious name.
And still I'm fucked.

14
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:39,392
I met death on route 23,
not too far from here.

15
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:41,352
But that was much later.

16
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:46,816
Back in 1967, the man
wearing the hat was my father.

17
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,694
In those days, he didn't have a son.

18
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,988
Five dollars says I spot him first.

19
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:53,698
I don't got five dollars.

20
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:55,908
Then you better win, gagootz.

21
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:57,285
Huh?

22
00:01:57,368 --> 00:02:00,246
- Uncle dick, think fast.
- You want to fight, huh?

23
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,125
The little fat kid
is my uncle, Tony. Soprano.

24
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,894
Your arms are too short.
You got nothing.

25
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:11,173
Well, we call him my uncle,
by marriage.

26
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:16,804
He choked me to death.

27
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:22,560
There! Pay up.

28
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,354
We have a winner, ladies and gents. Huh?

29
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:27,958
My grandfather and his brother

30
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:30,985
were with the dili/leo
crime family in Newark.

31
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,362
My grandfather was an associate,
but he stacked

32
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:35,299
- more scharol than any of the made guys.
- Pop!

33
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:37,366
Hey, there he is!

34
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,077
Including a Cadillac dealership.

35
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:47,710
Cara Mia, fammi presentare mio fig/io,
Richard moltisanti.

36
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:50,004
Everybody calls me Dickie.

37
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:54,842
Welcome to america.

38
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:56,177
Benvenuta.

39
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,387
America!

40
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,852
Most guys 65 go to Europe on vacation,
they come back with the gout.

41
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:08,272
You come back with the winner,
miss provolone, 1967.

42
00:03:11,484 --> 00:03:14,945
Oh. Antonio soprano.

43
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:22,119
After he murdered me,

44
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:25,373
Tony gave my wife and baby
his pocket change.

45
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,875
But that was much later.

46
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,139
I'm embarrassed.
You're all such great cooks over there.

47
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,267
Can you translate for me?

48
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:47,353
Forget it. She understands enough.

49
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:02,618
Giuseppina...

50
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:06,414
What does
your family do over there?

51
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:11,419
- Mio padre-
- the fascists killed her old man.

52
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:13,170
Her mother never recovered.

53
00:04:13,546 --> 00:04:14,922
Fuckin' Mussolini.

54
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:18,205
I don't get it. When I was a kid, you and
vito genovese always praised Mussolini.

55
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,761
Let's not talk politics at the table.

56
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:26,642
But I'll tell you, dick,
it's paradise over there.

57
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:29,687
On the one hand,
you can't believe the beauty.

58
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,274
On the other hand,
they don't even have toilets.

59
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:38,821
I told giuseppina, that you're gonna
live the life of a proud American lady.

60
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,907
And I'm gonna have my
second set of children with you.

61
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,455
And they'll be deluged with a life that
they could never even imagine over there.

62
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:51,417
Like you were, dick, as a kid.

63
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,462
These'll be your brothers and sisters.

64
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,881
So...

65
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,925
Giuseppina is your stepmother, Dickie.

66
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:42,843
It wasn't me who ripped you off!

67
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:46,013
Oh yeah? Oh, yeah? Come on!

68
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,193
- Shit!
- Harold.

69
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,779
All right, already.

70
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,256
This punk ass snapper.

71
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,950
Japped one of our runners, took 600 bucks.

72
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:11,580
- I want a full bag tomorrow.
- Who the fuck are you?

73
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:15,292
The guy who one time put out somebody's
eye for talkin' to him like that.

74
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,089
You winded there, Jesse Owens?

75
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:25,511
- I gotta quit smoking.
- I agree.

76
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,806
Can't I get you to switch to newports?

77
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:57,876
Hey, Harold. My son here say
he gonna be Hank Aaron when he grown up.

78
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,337
I'm gonna hit .318 like him.

79
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:02,798
- 318, your lucky number, boy, play it.
- Yeah.

80
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:06,260
Numbers is the only chance black folks got
to get out of this sinkhole city.

81
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,886
How does that work, anyway?

82
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,140
Well, you pick out three numbers,
like for you, three-one-eight.

83
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:14,101
You bet a quarter, and if your numbers
come on at the race track

84
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:17,479
then you win $125 for a quarter.

85
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:19,106
- For a quarter?
- Mm.

86
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,358
Bet a dollar, you get 500 dollars.

87
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:23,444
- You shitting me, Harold?
- -uh!

88
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:24,838
What if my numbers don't come out?

89
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,715
Well, if your numbers don't hit,
you don't get nothing.

90
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:29,408
Harold collects everybody's bets
and gives it to the man.

91
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,910
How you think the Italians
drive those long, fancy cars

92
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:34,330
and wear those diamond Swiss watches
on their wrists?

93
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:47,259
Thank you.
Thank you, everybody, welcome.

94
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:50,596
Uh... well, mostly, I, uh...

95
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,907
- I just want to say how PR...

96
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,893
Knock it off, Anthony.

97
00:07:58,354 --> 00:08:01,398
I want to say how proud I am
of my big girl, Janice...

98
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,569
Who is today... a woman.

99
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:08,822
Cheers!

100
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,908
You know, Janice, she, uh...

101
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:14,745
She went to her catechism.
She practiced her Latin.

102
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:18,123
She even stopped watching
those two stunods, Sonny and Cher,

103
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:20,769
- long enough to think about god, huh?
- Too much fucking salt on this...

104
00:08:20,793 --> 00:08:24,296
At least for a minute or two, but...
Boy, did she cost me.

105
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,634
You know, I made a bet that, uh, Janice
would not do her religious duties.

106
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:32,221
But if Janice did, you know,
got confirmed...

107
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,390
I'd shave off my mustache.

108
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:37,101
- Ohhh.

109
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,187
- Enjoy.
- His comare told him

110
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,648
it makes him look like Robert goulet.

111
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:53,617
- This stuff ain't so authentic.
- -ah! Ow!

112
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:54,952
Just use your fork.

113
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,787
But, uh, you know, the gravy's good.

114
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,038
Oh.

115
00:08:58,122 --> 00:09:00,249
- Your daughter's confirmation.
- Come here.

116
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:03,085
- Congrats, skip.
- I'm here, too, Mr. Handsome.

117
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,462
Yeah, and looking like a million dollars.

118
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,756
And not Mexican dollars, either.

119
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,591
What are you talking about?

120
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,805
Same fucking gang.

121
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,307
Colored kids hit one of my
colored runners.

122
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,601
Threw him a beating.

123
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:22,271
You believe this?
How these people prey on their own?

124
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,274
Hey, boot dimeo's gonna rag on me
when he sees this.

125
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,526
It looks bad too, perception-wise.

126
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:30,904
Even the papers say the numbers is
the biggest percentage of our cash flow.

127
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:35,033
Junior's right,
you gotta get your arms around this.

128
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,415
You got big ears there, gagootz?

129
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:45,335
Big brother, go and get yourself some pez.

130
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:53,343
Silvio, puss, come here.

131
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,637
- Marone!
-oh!

132
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,848
Huh? The second Mrs. Hollywood dick.

133
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,142
I was just explaining
to his holiness, here.

134
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,060
I think I went to school with your father.

135
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:05,606
Calogero Dante. "Butch."

136
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,775
He said you were a bully.

137
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:10,068
Whoa, what do we got here?

138
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,529
The Italian actress, Sophia lotsa-pizza,

139
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,698
get out of here, you fucking mutt!

140
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,869
- -Sorry.
- Buddha. It's Joe d.

141
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,412
He's up at the boot's mansion.

142
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,874
Mr. DiMaggio. Come stai?

143
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:27,419
Your saints name, you took
in church today, apollonia?

144
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:30,589
She's the patron Saint of dentists.

145
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:42,017
Take it from me,
chains are more effective than snow tires.

146
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,912
Why didn't you
bring the missus, dick?

147
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:46,855
I tried, but the poor kid's
self-conscious about her English.

148
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:49,233
She's making progress, though.

149
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,568
- I didn't catch the name.
- Pussy.

150
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:54,947
Don't worry, father,
it's not what you think it is.

151
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:00,619
This is my dog.

152
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:03,705
This is my dog.

153
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,626
This is your dog.

154
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,379
This is your dog.

155
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,173
Your dog.

156
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:18,762
Buddy durham
in the light trunks... the white trunks.

157
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:21,348
Durham has always been known
as a counter-puncher...

158
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,058
Hah.

159
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,144
[Announced
he gets a great hook in there.

160
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:27,980
Hey.

161
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,152
What did you learn to say?

162
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:40,534
This... is... his... bail.

163
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,080
Whose ball?

164
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,083
Spot.

165
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:54,131
I think this is a waste of money.

166
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,552
We hear from hoboken's own
chairman of the board.

167
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:01,013
Hi, there, my name is
Francis Albert Sinatra

168
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:03,932
and I got news for you.
Here's your host, William b. Williams.

169
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,519
My mother met his mother once. Frank.

170
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:09,313
Frank?

171
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:12,357
He grabbed me to go
to some party once.

172
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:15,652
It was on the Upper East Side,
it was a penthouse.

173
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,697
Some celebrity, I don't know who.

174
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:24,578
So... he and Dean, they have this donkey
brought downstairs to the basement.

175
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,247
And the donkey's just stuffed
full of laxatives, right?

176
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:29,249
So they put it in the private elevator.

177
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,544
They send the private elevator up,
the door opens,

178
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:37,341
and the donkey starts kicking and shitting
over everybody in the party!

179
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,432
Ah, your sister's cunt!

180
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,019
Junior, it's the summer of love.

181
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,700
Nice car.

182
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,578
You a friend of Dickie's?

183
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:08,038
No English.

184
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:16,880
Oh! Hopalong che si dice!

185
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:20,467
It's fucking light again?

186
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,595
Picked up from most of the runners,
but this kid, overall...

187
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,055
Who the fuck is overall?

188
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,391
He's a crazy young motherfucker
that runs the saints.

189
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,893
Leon overall. He's from east orange.

190
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:33,105
My cousin's the placekicker
over at the high school over there.

191
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:35,899
Yeah, well me and Harold played
east orange Thanksgiving game.

192
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,943
We used to beat 'em every fucking year.

193
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:41,238
You should have seen this man run.
Are you sure you don't got no black blood?

194
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,657
That's sicilians. I'm napoletano.

195
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,410
Oh! I'm siciliano.

196
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,539
Come on. Come over here.

197
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:58,630
The big picture, you told me this thing
was over with the black saints.

198
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:02,759
I know, I... thought I schooled the kid,
overall, when I whupped him, but...

199
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,430
He's got a wild hair across his ass.

200
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,641
I gotta know, Harold...

201
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:12,811
Aren't you humiliated
by what you just said?

202
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,105
I know I would be.

203
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:17,649
You're a grown man.

204
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:20,277
Fucking punk street gang?

205
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:52,768
Come on in, son. Have a seat.

206
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,570
I think we lost him.

207
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,033
Hold up. Hold up. Turn around.

208
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:12,370
Would I for sure be going to Vietnam?
Like my dream?

209
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,039
You heard about the gi. Bill?

210
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,792
Yeah, college. Sure.

211
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,960
Thinking about being a... scientist.

212
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,070
Wait over there.

213
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:27,052
No, this... this war wasn't my idea!

214
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,367
Isola, turn that light out.
I'm trying to sleep.

215
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,452
That's why I brought you
a seven and seven, baby.

216
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,333
What's the matter with you?

217
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,921
Goddamn gentleman Dickie moltisanti.

218
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,758
Always comes to me to handle
his nasty work.

219
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:09,761
Done made you his house nigger.

220
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:22,858
Put it away.

221
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,494
The army won't take me now.

222
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,582
I always wanted to join up, but I...

223
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,710
I had two felony convictions.

224
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,211
Take you?

225
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:47,090
Happened to stop by
a recruiting office today,

226
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:48,466
and it made me remember.

227
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,886
Brothers doing
all the dying over there.

228
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,053
We don't need no more.

229
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:53,937
Well, somebody's gonna win
the medal of honor.

230
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:58,185
Not a black man. Please.

231
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:02,480
Ooh, baby,
you are a riot tonight.

232
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,917
Make a right here.

233
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,419
- It's a one-way.
- Fuck it, make the right.

234
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:43,063
Fuck.

235
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:56,868
Step out of the car.

236
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:59,704
I know what I did, officer.

237
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:29,776
Oh!

238
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,953
Hey, why aren't they home,
sleeping till noon?

239
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,455
Two of our officers picked up
some colored taxi driver,

240
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,082
had to rough him up a little.

241
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:45,625
These morons think we killed him.

242
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,585
It spread around
the central ward that way.

243
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,879
They broke windows
up and down belmont Avenue.

244
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,482
They're throwing bricks and bottles at us.

245
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:53,150
We got two officers
had to go to the hospital.

246
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,969
No shit.

247
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,780
You ain't nothin'
without that badge!

248
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,807
You think this is funny?

249
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:04,686
Let's make amends

250
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:08,690
[Lgasps]

251
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,457
Get the fuck away from the car!

252
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:41,598
How lucky can one guy be

253
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:44,517
I kissed her and she kissed me

254
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:47,479
like the fella once said

255
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,710
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it for our host tonight.

256
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:55,528
They call him gentleman dick moltisanti.

257
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,701
Ah!

258
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:07,457
Paulie.

259
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:09,542
This?

260
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,089
It's about time.

261
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,716
Pinto the butcher sent over
some capuzzelle.

262
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,426
The fuck happen to you?

263
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:22,806
Something you gotta see.

264
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,155
What the fuck?

265
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:41,699
That's belmont Avenue.

266
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,885
You wanna get smart now?

267
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:43,970
Ma vaffanculo!

268
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,885
Why don't you go after the ditsoon, huh?
They almost burned the city down.

269
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,720
Oh, you'll hold the door, huh.

270
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,305
Daddy!

271
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,140
- Janice, go home!
-daddy!

272
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:31,059
Go home! Take the bus.

273
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:38,566
Hey, stop! Stop!

274
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:41,778
Anthony!

275
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:44,989
Anthony! What are you doing here?

276
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,417
My god!

277
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:58,920
What did they do?

278
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,856
We raided a card game, but we got lucky.

279
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,966
Picked up your husband
on an outstanding warrant.

280
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:05,385
- Had to take 'em somewhere.
- Warrant? For what?

281
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:07,345
Assault with a deadly weapon.

282
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:10,390
The lobster trap restaurant?
That wasn't him. He didn't do that.

283
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:12,267
- Where is he?
- Downtown.

284
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,936
He's downtown,
where he might get burned to death?

285
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,688
What are you people thinking?

286
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:18,606
Janice, shut up with that!

287
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,526
What were the two of you doing
at that card game?

288
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:23,903
Dad took Janice to ride the rides
while he played cards.

289
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:27,782
But he wouldn't take me because
I passed gas while he was eating lunch.

290
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:30,702
Get inside, both of you!

291
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:35,248
Anthony!

292
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:54,559
Standing in the ruins
of another black man's life

293
00:23:56,352 --> 00:24:00,690
or flying through the valley
separating day and night

294
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:04,235
"I am death," cried the vulture

295
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,405
"for the people of the light"

296
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:18,041
In a wilderness of heartbreak
and a desert of despair

297
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,501
Evil's clarion of justice

298
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:23,212
shrieks a cry of naked terror

299
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,923
taking babies from their mommas

300
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:28,134
Leaving grief beyond compare

301
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:31,387
please help me! Help me!
Please, help me!

302
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:35,767
So if you see the vulture coming
flying circles in your mind

303
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,770
-remember there is no escaping

304
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:41,856
for he will follow close behind

305
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,776
only promise me a battle

306
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:47,528
battle for your soul and mine

307
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:51,199
and mine

308
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:54,410
Talk to young negro men
on the street and they will tell you,

309
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:56,454
they say, they're supposed to go away

310
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:59,749
and die for this country
that isn't really theirs?

311
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,585
This tells you right there
that for understandable reasons,

312
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:05,505
they don't consider themselves
complete Americans.

313
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:07,632
And I don't say this
comprises all of them,

314
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:10,677
but it's obvious the reason
they can burn their own homes...

315
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,720
Huge fire.

316
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:15,848
Ashes.

317
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:32,031
Thought I heard somebody fall.

318
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:34,867
You fall, this morning?

319
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:44,043
You shouldn't wear your sunglasses
in the tub, you know?

320
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:55,054
He's got a temper. Arrabbiato, my father.

321
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:59,434
He start to yell.

322
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:02,311
Yeah, he wasn't like this back in ariano?

323
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:04,021
'Cause he used to...

324
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:06,649
Me, as a kid.

325
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,401
Every day.

326
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:13,156
I should have stayed there.

327
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:22,874
Maybe I come to america
for america money. But...

328
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:28,463
But here, in america, he become...

329
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,716
Uno stronzo!

330
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:40,183
I think maybe you still love him.

331
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:52,779
What's the matter with you?

332
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:55,531
My wife's right inside.

333
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,537
You're my father's wife.

334
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:23,434
_ _

335
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:05,101
Where are you going?

336
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:09,146
I'm going down to rexall.
The doc switched my blood thinner.

337
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,606
I'll ride with you.

338
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:24,120
What?

339
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,913
How high did she bounce?

340
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:28,976
- What are you talking about?
- When you threw her down the stairs.

341
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,419
Got two left feet.

342
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:33,230
'Cause you used to throw my mother
down the stairs.

343
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:34,731
I didn't like it then,
I don't like it now.

344
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:38,009
Well, some women like the rough stuff.
Don't ask me why.

345
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:41,137
Yeah, it's funny how they're all attracted
to Hollywood dick moltisanti.

346
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:46,309
You wanted to get into her fucking pants
since the day I brought her over.

347
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:49,562
I give you permission to picture her
while you're jerking off.

348
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,564
I promise you, you hurt her again,

349
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,792
- you're going down the stairs.
- Who the fuck do you think

350
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:55,460
- you're fucking talking to?
- You got away with it once with mom.

351
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,337
But I was a little kid.
You're not getting away with it again.

352
00:28:57,361 --> 00:29:00,406
Oh, I marry sluts. What do I know.

353
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:04,952
Hey! Get... get you're fucking...

354
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:06,913
Get off me! Hey! Hey!

355
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:18,799
- Dick-!

356
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:35,942
Pop.

357
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:49,956
Pop?

358
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:51,684
Uncle Dickie.

359
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,812
Anthony, what the fuck are you doing?

360
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:57,690
- The city's burning down.
- Over on Springfield Avenue.

361
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,900
Dickie? Who blew the horn?

362
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:01,736
I'm working on the car.

363
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:04,905
- You want pork chops tonight?
- Yeah, that's fine.

364
00:31:04,989 --> 00:31:06,549
Can I watch you work on the car?

365
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:09,744
- With the applesauce?
- I don't know what sauce!

366
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:11,537
I gotta go out for a while.

367
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,788
Can I?

368
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:15,499
- Can you what?
- Watch.

369
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,877
What the fuck did I just say, goddammit?
Now, go home!

370
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:31,223
From the wor news room.

371
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:34,894
American warplanes have expanded
the air war over north Vietnam

372
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:37,772
with the bombing of five
previously untouched targets

373
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:40,733
near the heart
of the port city of haiphong.

374
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,109
Four of the new targets,

375
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:44,862
one of them only a mile and a half
from haiphong...

376
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:02,963
Democratic majority leader
Mike Mansfield

377
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:05,216
- sounded a warning tonight...
- Go ahead, sir.

378
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,093
He's white.

379
00:34:08,214 --> 00:34:10,299
Three guesses who they blame this on.

380
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,468
The Harlem globetrotters.

381
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:33,447
They called him Hollywood dick.
Imagine what he looks like now.

382
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:37,201
Tell ma what you told me,
about the bird.

383
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:40,329
- There was a bird in the garage.
- -so?

384
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:41,664
It means somebody's gonna die.

385
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:44,583
You're talking through your hat.

386
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:48,212
A bird would never fly into a garage
to announce a death.

387
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:49,797
A house is another matter.

388
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:54,510
Poor Dickie.

389
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:57,972
I still can't believe it.

390
00:35:09,692 --> 00:35:13,237
I gotta talk to Johnny soprano,
the putrescible trash routes.

391
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,072
The sposato brothers
are making a grab.

392
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,384
You didn't hear? Johnny's gonna be
a guest of the government.

393
00:35:17,408 --> 00:35:18,659
He couldn't make bail.

394
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:21,328
When my brother's away,
everything goes through me.

395
00:35:21,412 --> 00:35:22,913
You got diarrhea?

396
00:35:22,997 --> 00:35:25,249
Comedian.

397
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:33,507
The three c's I owe you.

398
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,634
What the fuck is this?
It's supposed to be cash.

399
00:35:35,718 --> 00:35:37,469
That's an rca.

400
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:42,683
What am I gonna do with this?

401
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:54,862
What a blow.

402
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:58,198
Yeah, well at least you still
got your brother. I'm...

403
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,369
Yeah. I got nobody.

404
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:06,874
Dickie, consider me your brother
from now on, huh?

405
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,050
Where's your brother?

406
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:19,511
He went to see if he could sneak
into the room where they do the bodies.

407
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:26,185
In Newark tonight, state
troopers and the national guard ceased...

408
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:29,980
- You son of a bitch.
- You can't watch television in here.

409
00:36:30,064 --> 00:36:31,774
Vincent, it's the news.

410
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:35,277
President Johnson, we've been told,
has been following the situation...

411
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:38,614
Ah, they're never gonna catch
those bastards. I told the cops.

412
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:44,995
In the dull and commonplace
occurrences of day-to-day living,

413
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:50,709
one thing stands out
as a completely unique experience:

414
00:36:50,793 --> 00:36:52,169
Colt 45.

415
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:56,215
Jesus Christ.

416
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:58,759
The fuck's the matter with you?

417
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:01,887
You have no respect for my father,
you fucking animals!

418
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,347
He's dead!

419
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,784
Looks like the riots are
ending though, dick, that's good news.

420
00:37:05,808 --> 00:37:08,227
I wish that the shooter killed you!

421
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:10,187
All of you!

422
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:23,575
John Francis soprano.

423
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:26,203
On the charge of assault
with a deadly weapon,

424
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:27,663
I hereby sentence you

425
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:31,375
to no more than five
and no less than two years

426
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:33,544
in rahway state prison.

427
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:12,833
Uncle Sally.

428
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:16,128
I'm Dickie, your brother dick's boy.

429
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:26,722
How are you?

430
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:32,478
You know, I'm sorry, I know I never
came to visit you before.

431
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:34,563
My father wouldn't allow it.

432
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:43,906
I came to tell you...

433
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:48,368
Your brother, my dad... he passed.

434
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:51,371
They burned him up in the riots.

435
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,417
I brought you some sfogliatelle.

436
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,795
I don't eat dairy.

437
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:06,345
Well, you being out here isolated,

438
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:09,556
out of contact with the family,
my old man said you deserved it,

439
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,851
but I want to do whatever I can
to help you from now on.

440
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:15,020
It wasn't right how they treated you.

441
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:17,856
I was 25.

442
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,693
I murdered a made guy in our own family.

443
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:25,030
I'm here for a good reason.
You don't need to help me.

444
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:27,407
But...

445
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:29,409
What do you want, Richard?

446
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:37,501
I'll be honest with you.

447
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,380
I want to do a good deed.

448
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:44,174
A what?

449
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,052
A good deed.

450
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:57,187
Birth of the cool.

451
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,774
- -What?
- It's a record.

452
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,609
I'm a jazz nut.

453
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:05,696
Bring me a copy next time you come.

454
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:07,906
If you come.

455
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:25,799
- Quant'é Bella!
-si'?

456
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,302
It's so beautiful.

457
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:34,433
We're gonna go down to bamberger's.
We're gonna fill the place with furniture.

458
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:38,145
Madonna Mia.

459
00:40:39,563 --> 00:40:41,106
Mm.

460
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:46,111
- Could you give us a few minutes?
- You got it.

461
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,876
Aunt concetta says you've been
looking for a job.

462
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:04,379
At, uh, dilorenzo brothers beauty parlor.

463
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:06,465
I cut hair back in ariano.

464
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:10,886
You don't need to do that.
I want to keep taking care of you.

465
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:15,182
But I like to work, Dickie.
And america has so many work.

466
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:18,602
UN giorno, I want to have
my own beauty parlor.

467
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,937
Well, you're not gonna
work for those two fanooks.

468
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:23,482
The dilorenzos?

469
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,590
Motherfucker.

470
00:41:48,674 --> 00:41:50,634
I like that word.

471
00:41:51,385 --> 00:41:52,969
Motherfucker.

472
00:42:01,228 --> 00:42:04,398
- Eighteen. Paul's birthday.
- We don't take beatle birthdays.

473
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:06,441
We'd go broke.

474
00:42:06,525 --> 00:42:08,902
Fuck it. Make it eight. Micky dolenz.

475
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,030
I dreamed about whitey Ford last night.

476
00:42:12,114 --> 00:42:14,825
He wears number 16.

477
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:18,578
The boys basketball team
is playing St. Stephen's this afternoon.

478
00:42:18,662 --> 00:42:21,832
The high temperature today
will be 53 degrees.

479
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:25,001
Faculty advisory, absentees: 16.

480
00:42:25,794 --> 00:42:27,963
Sixteen, I hit the number!

481
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:30,716
You gotta talk to him.

482
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:32,777
- Johnny should do it.
- You're the only one he listens to.

483
00:42:32,801 --> 00:42:35,178
Johnny should do it.
You're gonna see him visiting day.

484
00:42:35,262 --> 00:42:37,073
Side door's open.

485
00:42:37,097 --> 00:42:38,533
Johnny's just gonna want to hit him,

486
00:42:38,557 --> 00:42:40,308
and he can't
because of the glass partition

487
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:43,437
and he's just gonna get frustrated.

488
00:42:44,104 --> 00:42:47,441
- Hey, jun'.
- I got some lady schick blow dryers.

489
00:42:47,524 --> 00:42:49,818
Livia, take one for yourself.
One for Janice.

490
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:53,655
I got bigger problems than blow dryers.
Anthony got kicked out of school.

491
00:42:53,739 --> 00:42:55,157
Let me go talk to him.

492
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,909
I promised Johnny I'd take care of Tony
while he was in jail.

493
00:42:57,993 --> 00:43:01,955
The way you talk, you just confuse him.
He only listens to Dickie.

494
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:03,874
Ah, va fa napoli.

495
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:07,169
Jun'. Leave me a blower for joanne.

496
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:13,341
What are you reading?

497
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,929
Oh, can't you read a regular comic?

498
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:20,932
You know, Superman, jughead.

499
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:25,020
It's about some Jewish girl and a knight.
And Robin hood's in it.

500
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:27,939
I didn't know they had Jews
back in the middle ages.

501
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:30,567
Well... the Bible.

502
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,945
Anyway, your mother asked me
to talk to you, so...

503
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:36,448
What, about getting suspended from school?

504
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:38,492
Hey, put that down, huh?

505
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:40,076
Sorry.

506
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:50,170
You know I don't like to lean on you
about stuff.

507
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:53,632
But you can't start
a gambling operation at school.

508
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:56,009
I know that... now.

509
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:59,012
Hey, don't bullshit me.
You always knew it.

510
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:00,782
And it's not just the gambling.
It's everything.

511
00:44:00,806 --> 00:44:02,808
The cherry bombs at the ymca,

512
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:04,452
letting the air
out of Mrs. Russo's tires...

513
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:05,352
I apologized to her!

514
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:07,330
You talk big about wanting to be
on the football team in high school

515
00:44:07,354 --> 00:44:09,648
and you're smoking already? Oh!

516
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:11,650
You gotta have a better attitude.

517
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:15,004
With you father gone,
your mother's got a lot on her plate.

518
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:16,696
You gotta be good.

519
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:19,491
I don't want have to
go through this again.

520
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,368
I try to be good.

521
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:24,788
I don't think so. Try harder.

522
00:44:29,376 --> 00:44:31,795
- Pinky swear?
-Jesus.

523
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:34,047
Hey, you don't talk to me like that.

524
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:36,007
See, you're not listening.

525
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,094
Fine. Pinky swear.

526
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:49,396
All right.

527
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:53,650
One time I went to playland...

528
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:56,778
I saw the cops shoot
a friend of my dad's right in the back.

529
00:44:56,862 --> 00:44:58,864
Yeah, chickie sasso.

530
00:44:58,947 --> 00:45:00,949
He still can't move his bowels
like normal.

531
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:06,329
I don't want that to happen to me.

532
00:45:06,413 --> 00:45:09,082
And it won't, gagootz.
Not while I'm around.

533
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:11,585
We're gonna see that it don't.

534
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:33,189
Junior. Junior.

535
00:45:33,273 --> 00:45:36,109
- Where's candy tonight?
- Migraine.

536
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:37,986
Again with the migraine...

537
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:39,905
Keep a close eye on that one.

538
00:45:39,988 --> 00:45:43,199
She keeps disappearing, she's probably
fucking some Tom, dick and Harry.

539
00:45:43,283 --> 00:45:44,492
Found a new gravy train.

540
00:45:44,576 --> 00:45:47,054
A guy checks into a hotel,
calls up the front desk,

541
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:48,788
"I got a leak in the sink."

542
00:45:48,872 --> 00:45:51,082
Clerk says, "go ahead.
Customer's always right."

543
00:45:52,626 --> 00:45:55,962
Yeah, that was funnier when
henny youngman told it.

544
00:45:56,046 --> 00:45:57,815
No, no, don't... don't.
Just leave it the way it is.

545
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:01,426
I wonder the origin of the sobriquet,
"gravy train" is.

546
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:03,553
They named it after the dog food.

547
00:46:03,637 --> 00:46:05,388
I don't know about you, junior.

548
00:46:05,472 --> 00:46:07,599
Guy tells you your girlfriend's
banging somebody else,

549
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:09,493
you're worried about the origin
of "gravy train"?

550
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:12,228
Oh!

551
00:46:12,312 --> 00:46:14,105
Oh, smile, my brother.

552
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:20,111
White flight.

553
00:46:20,195 --> 00:46:22,781
Oh! It's hopalong che si dice.

554
00:46:22,864 --> 00:46:25,158
- Whatever the fuck that means.
- Hey!

555
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:27,702
Language. There's ladies here.

556
00:46:27,786 --> 00:46:29,204
What can I get you?

557
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:32,415
Bartender's special tonight,
for the ladies: Pink squirrel.

558
00:46:32,499 --> 00:46:34,834
Courvoisier and coke. Water back.

559
00:46:34,918 --> 00:46:38,213
That what they drink
on the plantation?

560
00:46:39,798 --> 00:46:43,468
Oh, you didn't hear?
We're off the plantation.

561
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:45,971
We got wops digging ditches
since they come over.

562
00:46:46,054 --> 00:46:47,764
Hey, come on.

563
00:47:00,777 --> 00:47:02,737
It's Dickie's business. Let it go, Paulie.

564
00:47:02,821 --> 00:47:06,741
What the fuck's the matter with you?
You got a murder warrant over your head.

565
00:47:06,825 --> 00:47:09,244
I'm heading down south. North Carolina.

566
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:11,204
So where's your mule? Get going.

567
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:13,248
Thing is, I need to borrow some money.

568
00:47:13,915 --> 00:47:15,583
- How much?
- A grand.

569
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:19,087
All right, I'll tell you what.

570
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:24,676
I'm gonna give you five c's. Yeah?

571
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:26,696
It's my gift to you.
You don't gotta give it back.

572
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,389
- I want to pay you back.
- It's better this way.

573
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:31,033
You don't gotta be afraid
to say hello to me,

574
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:32,809
I don't gotta chase you down.

575
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:34,352
Won't come between us.

576
00:47:34,436 --> 00:47:36,438
So I guess this is goodbye.

577
00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:45,030
You said your goodbye, so go.

578
00:48:02,881 --> 00:48:07,052
You don't stare at those people.
They don't like it.

579
00:48:15,977 --> 00:48:17,538
Brought you
that record you wanted.

580
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:19,689
Plus, a couple others I picked out.

581
00:48:20,482 --> 00:48:22,108
What's this?

582
00:48:22,192 --> 00:48:26,112
Al hirt. Trumpet.
He's on Carson all the time.

583
00:48:26,196 --> 00:48:27,781
It's not jazz.

584
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:31,868
Take it back. These, too.

585
00:48:40,919 --> 00:48:44,380
So... you did your good deed.

586
00:48:44,464 --> 00:48:46,257
Well, don't put it like that.

587
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:49,260
I plan to do a lot more.

588
00:48:51,513 --> 00:48:53,807
Your poor father, huh?

589
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:59,104
He goes down to board up
that atta boy business that he had...

590
00:49:00,105 --> 00:49:03,399
And he dies in that horrible way.

591
00:49:03,483 --> 00:49:06,653
- It's just weird, though.
- What, weird?

592
00:49:06,736 --> 00:49:09,906
My brother's hands were soft.

593
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:11,866
Like a baby's pishadeel.

594
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:14,953
Always with the manicures, your father.

595
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:16,830
Yeah, what's your point?

596
00:49:16,913 --> 00:49:21,376
He never touched a hammer
or a board in his life.

597
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:32,262
What's your problem?

598
00:49:36,683 --> 00:49:38,184
Well, for one thing...

599
00:49:39,102 --> 00:49:41,187
My wife, she can't get pregnant.

600
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:44,691
You know, it takes a toll.
I want a son so bad.

601
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:46,860
What would you do?

602
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:49,279
It's the wanting.

603
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:52,991
- Huh?
- -the Buddhist will tell you:

604
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:54,909
All life is pain.

605
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:59,164
Pain comes from always wanting things.

606
00:50:00,373 --> 00:50:02,250
A son is not a thing.

607
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:05,545
It's the wanting.

608
00:50:11,301 --> 00:50:14,155
You know, tone, we could still run
that numbers game down at the fucking cyo.

609
00:50:14,179 --> 00:50:16,574
I got fucking suspended,
I can't get in fucking trouble again.

610
00:50:16,598 --> 00:50:18,683
No. Fucking school will never know.

611
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:20,452
I want to make it
to the NFL someday.

612
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:21,895
For that, I gotta go to college.

613
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:23,521
So I gotta watch my fucking ass.

614
00:50:23,605 --> 00:50:26,524
My old man told me I gotta run
his fucking restaurant when I grow up.

615
00:50:26,983 --> 00:50:28,318
What does your old man say?

616
00:50:28,401 --> 00:50:30,862
He says I gotta fucking Rob
your old man's restaurant.

617
00:50:33,281 --> 00:50:35,617
Do you know who I'd wanna be?
Your uncle Dickie.

618
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,327
How he fucking dresses?

619
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:41,039
He said he'd give me $500
if I graduate from fucking high school.

620
00:50:41,122 --> 00:50:42,707
Fuck, man.

621
00:51:07,774 --> 00:51:09,734
The sixties ended.

622
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:12,862
Neil young gave that speech
from the moon.

623
00:51:12,946 --> 00:51:16,157
Then came the rico statutes
around when I was born.

624
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:20,328
I wish I had come before that.

625
00:51:22,956 --> 00:51:24,499
Hey, uncle dick.

626
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:27,627
They're gonna be here soon.
We gotta get inside and hide.

627
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:30,880
Hey, Anthony, you go see
dirty Harry like I told you?

628
00:51:30,964 --> 00:51:34,092
"You gotta ask yourself,
do you feel lucky?"

629
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:36,010
"Well, do you, punk?"

630
00:51:40,265 --> 00:51:41,557
Marone.

631
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:46,437
It's that old fig tree,
in 'lino's back yard.

632
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:48,273
- Nothing changes.
- Yeah.

633
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:56,906
Nothing changes?
That's... that's poupette's house.

634
00:52:00,243 --> 00:52:01,869
- What are you mad at me for?
- -you-...

635
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:03,246
Mother...

636
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:05,623
How did you let this happen?

637
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:08,936
Oh, what do you want from me, Johnny?
I had plenty on my shoulders

638
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,920
taking care of things
while you were in the joint.

639
00:52:11,004 --> 00:52:12,505
- Yeah.
- Raising Anthony.

640
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:14,299
The disaster with the electricians union.

641
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:16,050
- -Ah!
- Your wife with the cramps.

642
00:52:16,134 --> 00:52:18,636
Boo-hoo-hoo!
Look at Dickie moltisanti.

643
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,347
His father gets whacked, he steps up.

644
00:52:21,431 --> 00:52:23,850
Takes care of his family,
takes care of all the business.

645
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:26,936
Not a peep out of him.
He's younger than you.

646
00:52:28,104 --> 00:52:29,230
Yeah.

647
00:52:29,314 --> 00:52:31,441
Surprise!

648
00:52:31,524 --> 00:52:33,168
- -Jesus Christ.
- There he is.

649
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,361
All I want to do is bang my goomah,
go to sleep.

650
00:52:35,445 --> 00:52:37,613
- Hey.
- Good to see you.

651
00:52:37,697 --> 00:52:40,337
- Hey, Paulie, how's your ma, huh?
- Much better.

652
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:44,287
- Johnny.
- Hey, baby, how are you? Come here.

653
00:52:45,246 --> 00:52:47,749
Did the surprise work?

654
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:51,336
You know, I'll tell you what surprised me.
You got shines on the block, huh?

655
00:52:51,419 --> 00:52:56,049
Oh, look at you. Not a pound.
He's just a regular charlton heston.

656
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:58,051
You come, you visit...

657
00:52:58,593 --> 00:53:01,012
But you don't tell me they moved in.
On my street.

658
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:02,430
- He's a doctor.
- A doctor.

659
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:04,140
He's not operating on me.

660
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,076
You gotta berate me
in front of everybody?

661
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,578
- Ah, Jesus.
- You know, just like always.

662
00:53:07,602 --> 00:53:10,104
- Ah, vanapoli.
- Come on.

663
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:15,276
- Hi, dad.
- What do you got on?

664
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,904
Go upstairs, right now,
put on some decent clothes.

665
00:53:17,987 --> 00:53:20,823
Johnny, it's what
they're wearing nowadays.

666
00:53:20,907 --> 00:53:22,575
Go do what I said, Janice.

667
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:27,580
Sweetie.
You recognize your daddy, pumpkin?

668
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:29,624
Yeah. That's it.

669
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:31,626
Yeah.

670
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:34,021
What's the matter with you?
Go give your father a proper hello.

671
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:36,339
- Stunod!

672
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:38,966
Come here.

673
00:53:42,011 --> 00:53:44,889
- I missed you, dad.
- I missed you too, kid.

674
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:48,059
You know,
I made your favorite pizza gain.

675
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:49,769
Even though it's not easter.

676
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:52,980
I got everybody together. I dressed up.

677
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:56,067
And you spit on it all, on me!

678
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:58,194
I didn't invite the coloreds
onto the block!

679
00:53:58,277 --> 00:53:59,487
Here we go.

680
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:02,073
Livia, give him a break.
He just did four years.

681
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:03,783
I did four years!

682
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:16,671
I missed your baked ziti, baby.

683
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:19,382
I put extra veal bones
in with the sausage.

684
00:54:21,384 --> 00:54:24,303
How about you, chooch?
You gonna be a linebacker, huh?

685
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:26,597
Coach says I'm gonna be starting.

686
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:30,351
He don't have the makings
of a varsity athlete.

687
00:54:30,435 --> 00:54:33,020
It was up to me,
you wouldn't be playing at all,

688
00:54:33,104 --> 00:54:35,273
but you went ahead
and you forged my signature.

689
00:54:35,356 --> 00:54:38,693
Nah, relax.
He's not gonna get hurt.

690
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:41,779
Here he is. Fresh from his nap.

691
00:54:41,863 --> 00:54:43,072
- Joanne, joanne...
- Yeah?

692
00:54:43,156 --> 00:54:45,450
- He hasn't met Johnny.
-aww...

693
00:54:45,533 --> 00:54:47,535
- Wow.
- Johnny...

694
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:49,370
This is our Christopher.

695
00:54:52,582 --> 00:54:55,126
Hello, Christopher moltisanti.

696
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:57,837
It's your uncle Johnny.
I'm back from england.

697
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:00,965
- Go with your daddy.
- Come here.

698
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:04,010
Oh! Bambolino!

699
00:55:04,093 --> 00:55:06,971
Finally, huh? Corrado, right?

700
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:08,848
- Got myself a son.
-hi.

701
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:11,267
I hear he's slow with the talking.

702
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:12,810
Hi, Christopher, hello!

703
00:55:14,437 --> 00:55:17,231
What's the matter? Don't cry.
It's only me, your uncle Tony.

704
00:55:17,315 --> 00:55:18,816
What's wrong. Cootchie-coo!

705
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,235
- -Oh. Oh!
- Okay. All right. All right.

706
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:24,363
You know, every time you're near him
he cries like this.

707
00:55:24,447 --> 00:55:25,907
I didn't do anything.

708
00:55:28,326 --> 00:55:31,370
What happened? It's okay.

709
00:55:31,454 --> 00:55:32,872
Look at that.

710
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:36,167
I don't know what it is,
it's like I scare him or something.

711
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:39,879
Some babies,
when they come into the world,

712
00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:43,257
know all kinds of things
from the other side.

713
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:59,357
Night descends
as the sun's light ends

714
00:56:00,191 --> 00:56:03,319
and black comes back, to blend again

715
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:05,446
- wake up, nigga - yes!

716
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:07,823
- And with the death of the sun
- wake up

717
00:56:07,907 --> 00:56:10,910
- night and blackness become one
- wake up

718
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:13,120
- blackness being you
- wake up, nigga

719
00:56:13,204 --> 00:56:16,374
peeping through the red
the white, and the blue

720
00:56:16,457 --> 00:56:19,669
dreaming of bars, black civilizations
that once flourished and grew

721
00:56:19,752 --> 00:56:21,003
-wake up, nigga -hey!

722
00:56:21,087 --> 00:56:23,506
Wake up, niggas or y'all through!

723
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:25,651
He's, right. He's right.

724
00:56:25,675 --> 00:56:28,469
Drowning in the puddles
of the white man's spit

725
00:56:28,553 --> 00:56:30,304
- wake up
- as you pause for some drawers

726
00:56:30,388 --> 00:56:32,557
-in the midst of shit -wake up

727
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,268
and ain't got nothing
to save your funky-ass with

728
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:37,687
-wake up, nigga -you cool, fool

729
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:40,231
sipping on a menthol cigarette
'round midnight

730
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:41,524
-wake up -rapping about how

731
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:43,192
the big apple is outta sight

732
00:56:43,276 --> 00:56:45,236
- wake up
- when you ain't never had a bite

733
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:49,115
- wake up
- who are you fooling? Me, you?

734
00:56:49,198 --> 00:56:51,909
Wake up, niggas or we 're all through!

735
00:56:51,993 --> 00:56:54,996
Yeah! Yeah!

736
00:57:04,422 --> 00:57:07,717
That's some inspirational shit.
Even the speeches.

737
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:11,262
This decides me.

738
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:14,890
Know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna start my own book.

739
00:57:14,974 --> 00:57:17,560
- You're gonna do what?
- We're gonna start...

740
00:57:18,978 --> 00:57:21,981
First black numbers bank
in the central ward.

741
00:57:26,027 --> 00:57:30,656
Nigga, you talking about facing down
the motherfucking mafia.

742
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:32,617
Frank Lucas will be my backer.

743
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:35,244
He's got money up his ass from the skag.

744
00:57:35,328 --> 00:57:38,205
- You know the dope king?
- Down home.

745
00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:39,707
Country boys.

746
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,377
This ain't greensboro, north cackalacky.

747
00:57:44,253 --> 00:57:46,839
The Italians got soldiers over there.

748
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:48,174
Okay? That's what the call 'em.

749
00:57:48,257 --> 00:57:50,968
What... what's the matter,
you ain't no soldier?

750
00:57:51,636 --> 00:57:55,264
- Never thought about myself that way, no.
- Well, think about it.

751
00:57:57,350 --> 00:57:58,267
Right...

752
00:57:58,351 --> 00:58:00,191
"He's got a gun, " you think,
"and I haven't."

753
00:58:00,269 --> 00:58:01,854
You figure it's the gun.

754
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:04,440
Well, listen, soldier.

755
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:08,235
Thousands of guys got guns,
but there's only one Johnny Rocco!

756
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:10,005
How do you account for it?

757
00:58:10,029 --> 00:58:12,382
Well, he knows
what he wants. Don't you, Rocco?

758
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:14,200
- Sure.
- What's that?

759
00:58:14,283 --> 00:58:15,743
Tell him, Rocco.

760
00:58:16,327 --> 00:58:19,246
- Well, I want, uh...
- He wants more.

761
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:22,124
- Don't you, Rocco?
- Yeah, that's it. More.

762
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:24,335
That's right, I want more.

763
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:25,961
Here.

764
00:58:26,045 --> 00:58:29,507
Why don't you buy you and your friends
some of those, uh... McDonald's.

765
00:58:30,049 --> 00:58:31,884
- The burgers?
- Yeah.

766
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:35,513
Yes, and I had hopes once, but...

767
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:37,181
Hopes for what?

768
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:40,142
A world in which there's
no place for Johnny Rocco.

769
00:58:41,143 --> 00:58:43,562
Okay, soldier, you can make
your hopes come true.

770
00:58:44,647 --> 00:58:46,107
But you gotta die for it.

771
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:49,110
See where I'm aiming?
Right at your belly.

772
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:51,153
Go ahead, shoot.

773
00:58:54,615 --> 00:58:56,117
Your turn, daddy.

774
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:01,622
All right.

775
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:08,462
Hey, hopalong che si dice.

776
00:59:10,423 --> 00:59:12,383
Oh, fuck.

777
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:18,597
How's it going, Harold?

778
00:59:18,681 --> 00:59:21,058
Cyril, how's your ass?

779
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,311
How you doing, son?

780
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:26,647
I'm taking my nephew
to the Yankees game.

781
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:30,317
Is something funny back there?

782
00:59:30,818 --> 00:59:32,528
Sorry, uncle dick.

783
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:35,865
- No, really, I'm sorry!
- You fuckstick.

784
00:59:35,948 --> 00:59:38,325
I heard your ass
was back in Jersey.

785
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:40,244
You still got that warrant over your head?

786
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:42,705
Lead detective died. Nobody gives a shit.

787
00:59:43,706 --> 00:59:46,500
Leon overall had been a white boy,
it'd be a whole different story.

788
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:51,046
Hey, Harold, how 'bout you come around,
talk to me over here.

789
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:01,056
When are you gonna come back
and work for me?

790
01:00:02,892 --> 01:00:05,186
Got stuff of my own percolating.

791
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:08,814
While you're waiting
for that Maxwell house to boil...

792
01:00:30,377 --> 01:00:32,171
Hey, how much he give you?

793
01:00:34,757 --> 01:00:37,092
Like I'm a fucking Pullman Porter.

794
01:00:37,176 --> 01:00:38,761
Man, it's a hundred dollars.

795
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:46,060
I need to see the lease.

796
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:50,189
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

797
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:56,529
Due per cento increase every year.
Six and a half years still.

798
01:00:56,612 --> 01:00:57,863
Right?

799
01:00:57,947 --> 01:00:59,490
- -I like.
- Yeah.

800
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:02,076
It's dionne wannick.

801
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:04,203
Comes from right over here
in south orange.

802
01:01:04,286 --> 01:01:06,789
- I love dionne Warwick.
- Me, too.

803
01:01:07,373 --> 01:01:09,792
I wonder where she gets her hair done.

804
01:01:10,626 --> 01:01:13,212
Probably some fancy place
in Beverly Hills.

805
01:01:13,295 --> 01:01:16,298
I bet she pays a hundred dollars.
Oof! Marone!

806
01:01:16,382 --> 01:01:18,843
I should move to Beverly's hill.

807
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:22,221
Where'd you learn to do hair?

808
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:24,723
- I learned from Mia mamma.
- Mm.

809
01:01:24,807 --> 01:01:28,477
My... she had a chair
in the front room.

810
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:33,440
Women would come, and I sweep up.

811
01:01:33,524 --> 01:01:36,235
- And I watch.
- Oh, how wonderful.

812
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:38,779
- But that's not the life I want for me.
- Mm.

813
01:01:38,863 --> 01:01:41,782
Over there, you get old so fast.

814
01:01:42,283 --> 01:01:45,160
Ten children and a big, black dress.

815
01:01:45,244 --> 01:01:46,912
You know, over there,

816
01:01:46,996 --> 01:01:49,248
I wanted to be a priest.

817
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:52,293
- You mean "nun."
- No, no, priest.

818
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:54,879
Nuns have to do what they told.

819
01:01:54,962 --> 01:01:57,548
The priest is the boss.

820
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,592
Capo.

821
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:03,345
So you never tried the convent, huh?

822
01:02:03,721 --> 01:02:05,055
Not for me.

823
01:02:05,681 --> 01:02:08,142
I could not stand the silence.

824
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:09,935
- No male.
- No, yeah.

825
01:02:10,019 --> 01:02:15,149
You wind up doing push-ups
in the asparagus garden.

826
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:17,860
You know?

827
01:02:22,031 --> 01:02:24,283
- What's so funny?
- Nuns.

828
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:27,369
They weren't so funny when they were
hitting me with a ruler.

829
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:30,849
First thing you gotta do
is look at the lease.

830
01:02:30,873 --> 01:02:31,999
Is that the lease?

831
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:35,127
We already look at the lease.
It's good.

832
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:37,212
Oh, yeah? I'm gonna look it over.

833
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:49,850
There's just one thing
I want to make better.

834
01:02:49,934 --> 01:02:52,519
- -Oh, yeah?
- New sinks.

835
01:02:53,646 --> 01:02:55,648
Those are disgust.

836
01:02:55,731 --> 01:02:58,067
We can do that, sure.

837
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:00,945
This is some fantastic salsicce.

838
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:07,701
I am worried about
the fucking boiler, though.

839
01:03:07,785 --> 01:03:09,703
Looked like shit.

840
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:12,039
- Inspector says it's fine.
- Okay, okay.

841
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:14,851
But the thing about remodeling is
you start with the sinks and then you go,

842
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:16,478
"we might as well do this other thing
while we're at it."

843
01:03:16,502 --> 01:03:18,212
- It spins out of control.
-ah.

844
01:03:20,422 --> 01:03:22,716
We don't want to be
pouring good money after bad.

845
01:03:24,385 --> 01:03:26,720
Can you stop eating for one minute?

846
01:03:32,059 --> 01:03:34,436
No capisce, but I'm all fuckin' ears.

847
01:03:35,688 --> 01:03:38,232
So we're not going to buy it for me,
the beauty parlor?

848
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:41,318
All I'm saying, I don't want us walking
into a stupid situation.

849
01:03:41,402 --> 01:03:42,903
You think I'm stupid?

850
01:03:42,987 --> 01:03:44,780
Oh, let me ask you, what are you,
on the rag?

851
01:03:44,863 --> 01:03:48,200
Every time I say something you don't like,
you ask me if I'm...

852
01:03:50,119 --> 01:03:53,580
First you tell me to find a store
I can turn into beauty parlor.

853
01:03:53,664 --> 01:03:55,749
I do that. You say it looks good.

854
01:03:55,833 --> 01:03:59,294
Then you say, "no, let's buy a place
already a beauty parlor."

855
01:03:59,378 --> 01:04:01,964
I find this place. Now the boiler!

856
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,383
Sweetheart, why are we arguing
about fucking plumbing?

857
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:06,593
I always want to do right by you!

858
01:04:06,677 --> 01:04:07,678
You know, I love you!

859
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:13,851
- You know I don't speak Italian!
- Maybe you should learn!

860
01:04:13,934 --> 01:04:16,186
- Oh, where you going?
- To put on a robe.

861
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:17,730
I'm cold.

862
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:40,878
Better hurry up. Pot roast night.

863
01:04:40,961 --> 01:04:42,838
Right. You know wednesdays
I gotta go home.

864
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:44,357
And what are you getting so pissy about?

865
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:46,508
Why did I make the sausage?

866
01:04:47,301 --> 01:04:51,180
To make me happy?
Because I love it?

867
01:04:51,263 --> 01:04:53,849
But it's not as good as
joanne's fucking pot roast.

868
01:04:53,932 --> 01:04:56,769
- Ah, you're digging at joanne again.
- I hate her.

869
01:04:56,852 --> 01:04:59,813
Of course you do.
It's only natural.

870
01:05:00,606 --> 01:05:03,317
Go home and eat.
I don't want the beauty salon.

871
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,693
Ah, vafangool.

872
01:05:04,777 --> 01:05:06,361
Motherfucker!

873
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:09,782
You think you know everything!

874
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:35,140
- Jackie, you drive stick?
- Fuck no.

875
01:05:35,224 --> 01:05:37,226
- -I do!
- You drive.

876
01:05:37,309 --> 01:05:39,728
Grab his arm, hold him down.

877
01:05:40,229 --> 01:05:41,313
Fucking punks!

878
01:05:47,903 --> 01:05:49,823
We're gonna get in so much
fucking trouble!

879
01:05:50,322 --> 01:05:52,699
- My father's gonna use the belt on me!
- You little shit!

880
01:05:52,783 --> 01:05:56,912
If anybody tells anybody about this,
next time we use the belt.

881
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:10,926
Oh! Come here! Free ice cream!

882
01:06:16,682 --> 01:06:18,142
Here, here.

883
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:23,397
Get more of it.

884
01:06:27,401 --> 01:06:29,278
Here, here. Here you go.

885
01:06:30,863 --> 01:06:33,824
Here you go. How 'bout this one?
There you go, sweetheart.

886
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:38,829
That manicotti at vesuvio's is so rich.

887
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:41,224
How'd you hear about them
throwing mister softee a beating?

888
01:06:41,248 --> 01:06:43,458
His cousin Tony blundetto
told Janice.

889
01:06:43,542 --> 01:06:45,478
I was down in the islands
when he pulled that shit.

890
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:48,672
If I was home I'd have given him
a schiaff he'd never forget.

891
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:50,355
What's he want to be when he gets older?

892
01:06:50,382 --> 01:06:52,676
Thinks he's gonna be a football player.

893
01:06:52,759 --> 01:06:54,094
He's good.

894
01:06:54,178 --> 01:06:56,178
I don't think he's pro material.

895
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:58,724
- What do you think, dick?
- Probably not.

896
01:06:58,807 --> 01:07:02,603
But who knows, he puts on a few pounds,
four years of college ball...

897
01:07:02,686 --> 01:07:06,023
He should go to work for my cousin frank
in the patio furniture business.

898
01:07:06,106 --> 01:07:07,316
Here we go with that tune.

899
01:07:07,399 --> 01:07:10,336
So maybe he's not a ball player, but li,
you don't wanna step on the kid's dream.

900
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,737
You always take his side.

901
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:14,114
Look, you give him
the best advice you can,

902
01:07:14,198 --> 01:07:16,867
you lead by example,
he'll make the right decision.

903
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:19,578
- This kid's got what it takes.
- That's what I'm saying.

904
01:07:19,661 --> 01:07:22,164
We all do things like that
when we're kids, right?

905
01:07:22,247 --> 01:07:24,208
Beat up the mister softee man.

906
01:07:24,291 --> 01:07:27,252
If my Christopher grew up to be like Tony,
I'd be goddamn proud of him.

907
01:07:27,336 --> 01:07:28,962
I told him the other day, I said,

908
01:07:29,046 --> 01:07:31,590
"you play football for a career,
it doesn't last long.

909
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:34,551
You wind up an old crippled man
by the time you're 32."

910
01:07:34,635 --> 01:07:38,055
Bobby piocosta, he's a junior,
on Anthony's team.

911
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:40,390
He fractured his shoulder last week.

912
01:07:40,474 --> 01:07:42,017
The mother was hysterical.

913
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,436
They had to take him
to a specialist at St. barnabas.

914
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:46,164
You think the school's gonna pay for that?

915
01:07:46,188 --> 01:07:49,566
That's some Christmas present, huh?
Having your kid laid up.

916
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:51,610
He can't help outside,
hang the decorations.

917
01:07:51,693 --> 01:07:53,237
He can't help shovel the walk...

918
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:07,668
Don't give me that look. Hm?

919
01:08:32,192 --> 01:08:34,194
I thought it will be different.

920
01:08:36,113 --> 01:08:37,572
What?

921
01:08:38,824 --> 01:08:40,951
Make love with a black man.

922
01:08:42,077 --> 01:08:43,537
Is it?

923
01:08:49,334 --> 01:08:51,545
It's all about Italian men, huh?

924
01:08:53,005 --> 01:08:55,507
There's stories about Dean Martin
and rossano brazzi,

925
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:57,301
how they're great lovers.

926
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:00,595
If you feed them.

927
01:09:00,679 --> 01:09:02,681
Oh!

928
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:04,099
Oh!

929
01:09:04,683 --> 01:09:07,519
You gotta give Dickie
his meatballs and his noodles.

930
01:09:08,228 --> 01:09:10,188
I'm Dickie's comare.

931
01:09:14,276 --> 01:09:17,654
Dickie and his friends,
they like their women to stay at home.

932
01:09:17,738 --> 01:09:19,114
Don't go out.

933
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:21,908
Wait on them, hand and feet.

934
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:27,539
I'd stack my bread if you were my girl.

935
01:09:29,041 --> 01:09:33,128
You want to have your own beauty parlor?
Knock yourself out. I'd even back it.

936
01:09:33,211 --> 01:09:37,549
- You want your woman to work?
- No, but I'd be real proud of her.

937
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:40,552
Owning a business.

938
01:09:41,011 --> 01:09:43,221
My mama used to take in the washing.

939
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:47,392
I always respected her for that.

940
01:09:54,608 --> 01:09:58,737
Dickie says colored men
don't have no head for making money.

941
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:13,752
Well, that's what we're gonna find out.

942
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:33,021
Four, two, seven.

943
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:34,731
Box it for me?

944
01:10:34,815 --> 01:10:36,775
You know, another nurse
hit the number last night.

945
01:10:36,858 --> 01:10:38,151
Big time.

946
01:10:38,235 --> 01:10:40,070
Damn. Who was it?

947
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:42,030
What do I know,
it was up in the first ward.

948
01:10:42,114 --> 01:10:43,907
It was, uh... it was St. Michaels.

949
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,367
Thatjinxes it for me.

950
01:10:56,711 --> 01:10:59,191
See, the law of averages say you got
the same chance of hitting

951
01:10:59,256 --> 01:11:00,549
as any two random people.

952
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:04,428
Yeah, but two people at the same time
don't have the same chance of winning.

953
01:11:04,511 --> 01:11:05,804
That's the law of averages.

954
01:11:05,887 --> 01:11:08,306
That's a fallacy, Ms. Johnson.
It's all random.

955
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:10,267
You don't understand fate.

956
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:15,647
What do you got for me, professor?

957
01:11:17,732 --> 01:11:18,984
See you tomorrow.

958
01:11:26,366 --> 01:11:28,660
Tomorrow there'll be a brother here
for the pickup.

959
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:32,456
No more whitey's cut.

960
01:11:40,547 --> 01:11:42,382
What the fuck, man?

961
01:11:56,354 --> 01:12:00,942
And this black guy, Harold mcbrayer,
popped one of my guys.

962
01:12:01,026 --> 01:12:03,403
He used to be a runner of mine.

963
01:12:03,487 --> 01:12:05,572
We don't know who ordered it.
We can't find mcbrayer.

964
01:12:06,865 --> 01:12:08,575
So what do you want from me?

965
01:12:09,326 --> 01:12:11,495
I was thinking maybe
you could ask in here.

966
01:12:12,204 --> 01:12:15,916
Nation of islam, talk to Alonzo Turner,
see if any of them knows anything.

967
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:18,460
I don't talk to people in here.

968
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:21,630
I mostly read all day.

969
01:12:25,634 --> 01:12:27,844
How you doing on your merit badges?

970
01:12:30,639 --> 01:12:33,141
I'm coaching a beep baseball team.

971
01:12:33,642 --> 01:12:34,851
A who?

972
01:12:34,935 --> 01:12:38,313
It's baseball. For blind kids.

973
01:12:39,564 --> 01:12:41,066
Get the fuck outta here.

974
01:12:41,149 --> 01:12:42,817
No, for real.

975
01:12:52,953 --> 01:12:54,579
Run, run, run, come on!

976
01:12:54,663 --> 01:12:56,081
Shortstop, left!

977
01:12:59,501 --> 01:13:02,546
Way to go, coach.
Our boys looked sterling out there today.

978
01:13:02,629 --> 01:13:06,424
Two, four, six, eight,
who do we appreciate?

979
01:13:06,508 --> 01:13:09,803
Coach moltisanti! Coach moltisanti!

980
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:12,180
You're a Saint!

981
01:14:01,229 --> 01:14:02,564
{gunshofl - oh, shit!

982
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:03,773
Gun!

983
01:14:07,193 --> 01:14:08,486
Where's Harold?

984
01:14:08,570 --> 01:14:10,655
In your mother's fat Guinea ass.

985
01:14:10,739 --> 01:14:12,907
You take that back!

986
01:14:12,991 --> 01:14:15,076
Who put him up to it, Angelo salerno?

987
01:14:15,869 --> 01:14:16,995
Anthony bello?

988
01:14:17,412 --> 01:14:19,289
Chef boyardee.

989
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:25,253
Put him on the table!

990
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:28,673
Pussy, grab his legs.

991
01:14:31,843 --> 01:14:34,304
What are you gonna do,
rotate my tires?

992
01:14:37,974 --> 01:14:39,434
Dick, I just got this jacket.

993
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:47,901
Open!

994
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:49,611
- What about it?
- Fuck you!

995
01:14:54,658 --> 01:14:56,326
Stop for a minute!

996
01:14:56,409 --> 01:14:58,161
God damn it!

997
01:14:58,244 --> 01:15:00,872
I don't fucking...

998
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:08,004
Harold! Harold mcbrayer!

999
01:15:08,088 --> 01:15:09,506
I asked you whose idea it was!

1000
01:15:09,589 --> 01:15:12,384
I told you! It was Harold!
Nobody put him up to it!

1001
01:15:12,467 --> 01:15:14,469
- Oh...

1002
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:35,448
The fucker acted on his own?

1003
01:15:36,408 --> 01:15:38,118
Come on. All right, Dickie.

1004
01:15:38,243 --> 01:15:40,245
Go get it.

1005
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:46,126
That fall, Johnny moved
to the suburbs, the black thing.

1006
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,045
And he was seriously earning.

1007
01:15:50,422 --> 01:15:53,425
This move made Tony half a pussy,
in my estimation.

1008
01:15:55,719 --> 01:15:58,012
What made you think
it was a good idea

1009
01:15:58,096 --> 01:16:00,849
to steal the answers to the geometry test?

1010
01:16:02,684 --> 01:16:08,565
I didn't study, and, uh, I needed to pass,
so I could stay on the football team.

1011
01:16:08,648 --> 01:16:12,026
You know, you got Charlie nodzak
in trouble, too,

1012
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:14,028
when you paid him for the answers.

1013
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:17,532
Well, he was the only kid I knew
on the mimeo squad.

1014
01:16:17,615 --> 01:16:20,493
Well, Charlie was on the honor roll.

1015
01:16:20,577 --> 01:16:22,746
And you're missing the point.

1016
01:16:22,829 --> 01:16:24,956
You know stealing the test was wrong.

1017
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:29,002
Yeah, I guess so.

1018
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:31,522
But if you're gonna kick me out of school,
I mean, you should just do it,

1019
01:16:31,546 --> 01:16:33,339
instead of us talking about it.

1020
01:16:35,884 --> 01:16:37,594
You talk a lot at home?

1021
01:16:40,013 --> 01:16:41,473
I don't know.

1022
01:16:43,725 --> 01:16:47,896
Well, your dad, for example,
what does he talk to you about?

1023
01:16:50,982 --> 01:16:52,317
The lawn.

1024
01:16:53,026 --> 01:16:54,569
What about the lawn?

1025
01:16:55,653 --> 01:16:58,615
I don't know, he goes to yankee stadium
and he comes home

1026
01:16:58,698 --> 01:17:00,450
and says our lawn looks crummy.

1027
01:17:01,826 --> 01:17:05,622
What about your mother?
Is she someone who likes to talk a lot?

1028
01:17:07,582 --> 01:17:09,250
I guess so.

1029
01:17:11,169 --> 01:17:14,964
Well... what makes her happy?

1030
01:17:15,632 --> 01:17:18,551
Happy? My mother?

1031
01:17:23,473 --> 01:17:25,308
Let's go, Anthony.

1032
01:17:25,391 --> 01:17:29,062
I wonder if I could talk to you
for a moment alone, Mrs. Soprano?

1033
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:33,358
Well, it's gonna have to be fast,
'cause I'm parked at the hydrant.

1034
01:17:38,947 --> 01:17:42,534
On the basis of
the Stanford-binet, he's high IQ,

1035
01:17:42,617 --> 01:17:45,203
- but you know that.
- You can't prove it by me.

1036
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:47,413
He's got a d-plus average.

1037
01:17:47,497 --> 01:17:50,041
Well, that's because
he doesn't apply himself,

1038
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:52,085
but he is smart.

1039
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:57,507
There's a big difference
between a smart person and a smart aleck.

1040
01:17:59,217 --> 01:18:03,888
I also administered the Briggs-Myers
personality inventory just now,

1041
01:18:03,972 --> 01:18:06,224
and the results tell us, he's a leader.

1042
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:11,354
"Enthusiastic, insightful, playful."

1043
01:18:11,437 --> 01:18:13,940
Ah, you're talking through your hat.

1044
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:20,113
He did tell me one thing
I'd like to share with you.

1045
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:22,490
But it's gotta be fast,
because I'm still at the hydrant.

1046
01:18:22,574 --> 01:18:24,718
Do you remember a children's book
called sutter's mill...

1047
01:18:24,742 --> 01:18:28,371
- No.
- About the gold rush in California?

1048
01:18:28,454 --> 01:18:31,165
Yeah, maybe I do. Yeah?

1049
01:18:31,249 --> 01:18:35,420
He told me about a night
your husband was... away.

1050
01:18:37,672 --> 01:18:40,466
And you got in the bed with Anthony
and hugged him.

1051
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:48,474
He said that?

1052
01:18:48,558 --> 01:18:52,312
No, his exact words were you
"snuggled up close".

1053
01:19:00,278 --> 01:19:04,032
Yeah. Yeah, I remember that now.

1054
01:19:04,115 --> 01:19:06,576
You read to him from that book.

1055
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:10,747
Long into the night, apparently.
He remembered details.

1056
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:14,584
He didn't know the word "ingot,"
and you explained it to him.

1057
01:19:19,839 --> 01:19:22,926
He said it was one of his
best memories of his life.

1058
01:19:35,021 --> 01:19:36,856
Is that a hotel Bible?

1059
01:19:38,858 --> 01:19:40,777
I forget where I got it.

1060
01:19:41,778 --> 01:19:44,822
Baby, cousin cyril is dead.

1061
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:03,299
You're supposed to do an hour.

1062
01:20:03,383 --> 01:20:05,009
It's an hour on, ten minutes off.

1063
01:20:05,093 --> 01:20:08,113
All of a sudden youse two are
only on 40 minutes and then disappear.

1064
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:10,866
- We don't know where the fuck you are.
- We're off somewhere thinking,

1065
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:12,910
"what more can we do
for gentleman dick and Johnny?"

1066
01:20:12,934 --> 01:20:14,769
Don't get cute.

1067
01:20:14,852 --> 01:20:16,854
Where's giuseppina tonight?

1068
01:20:16,938 --> 01:20:19,816
Ah, the movies with her girlfriend.

1069
01:20:19,899 --> 01:20:21,359
I would eat her shit.

1070
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:23,403
Oh!

1071
01:20:26,656 --> 01:20:30,243
You don't talk about her that way.
In fact, you don't talk about her at all.

1072
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:31,953
Hey, take it easy!

1073
01:20:32,036 --> 01:20:33,162
I love her. I love her!

1074
01:20:33,246 --> 01:20:34,789
{gunshofl - get down!

1075
01:20:36,374 --> 01:20:37,959
Hey, asshole!

1076
01:20:39,002 --> 01:20:41,004
_ _ Dickie!

1077
01:20:41,546 --> 01:20:42,630
Mother...!

1078
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:51,681
Come on, you fucker. Come here.

1079
01:20:52,098 --> 01:20:55,098
- You like that, huh? How 'bout that?
- Come on, you motherfuckers.

1080
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,894
{gunshofl -

1081
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,730
Fuck!

1082
01:21:10,658 --> 01:21:12,660
No, no, no!
Frankie, Frankie, Frankie!

1083
01:21:12,744 --> 01:21:13,786
Frankie!

1084
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:18,166
You, mother...!

1085
01:21:22,170 --> 01:21:23,170
Shit!

1086
01:22:55,513 --> 01:22:57,515
Anthony, come eat!

1087
01:23:02,603 --> 01:23:03,980
There's my big boy.

1088
01:23:04,063 --> 01:23:06,274
Oh, cool, man, a hamburger.

1089
01:23:06,357 --> 01:23:08,860
I thought you'd like a change
from a mortadella sandwich.

1090
01:23:08,943 --> 01:23:10,570
I made it special for you.

1091
01:23:13,322 --> 01:23:14,782
You look nice.

1092
01:23:14,866 --> 01:23:15,950
Aww...

1093
01:23:16,701 --> 01:23:19,954
Me and aunt Mary are going to the city
to see no, no, nanette.

1094
01:23:21,247 --> 01:23:24,208
- What's that?
- Broadway. A play.

1095
01:23:24,292 --> 01:23:26,586
Shoes are killing my bunions.

1096
01:23:26,669 --> 01:23:28,588
You should go see Dr. Cuomo.

1097
01:23:28,671 --> 01:23:31,591
We don't go to him anymore.

1098
01:23:32,633 --> 01:23:34,218
We don't?

1099
01:23:34,302 --> 01:23:38,181
- He said some very rude things to me.
- Like what?

1100
01:23:38,264 --> 01:23:42,268
He wants me to take pills
for my sleeping.

1101
01:23:42,351 --> 01:23:44,437
And... and other things.

1102
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:47,523
I'm not some lunatic.

1103
01:23:49,192 --> 01:23:51,861
No, but maybe some medicine
would be good.

1104
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:54,405
You and your father.
Why don't you get in line to blame me.

1105
01:23:54,488 --> 01:23:56,365
I wasn't blaming you,
I was just saying...

1106
01:23:56,449 --> 01:23:59,827
This new thing... called elavil.

1107
01:23:59,911 --> 01:24:02,246
For people who are sick in the head.

1108
01:24:06,918 --> 01:24:09,629
Go runnin' for the shelter

1109
01:24:09,712 --> 01:24:12,256
of a mother's little helper

1110
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:14,133
what?

1111
01:24:14,217 --> 01:24:15,843
It's a song.

1112
01:24:15,927 --> 01:24:19,013
- It's by the stones.
- Exactly what I'm talking about.

1113
01:24:19,096 --> 01:24:21,641
They're drug addicts. I don't take drugs.

1114
01:24:21,724 --> 01:24:25,436
The song's not saying
that you take drugs, it's...

1115
01:24:28,648 --> 01:24:30,983
You smoking marijuana, I suppose?

1116
01:24:31,859 --> 01:24:34,612
- Mom, I'm on the team.
- Your sister is.

1117
01:24:34,695 --> 01:24:36,447
I'm almost sure of it.

1118
01:24:37,073 --> 01:24:38,467
This hamburger's great, mom.

1119
01:24:38,491 --> 01:24:39,909
- It's really good.
-go on.

1120
01:24:41,619 --> 01:24:43,120
I went to all that trouble

1121
01:24:43,204 --> 01:24:45,915
just so we could have a nice
conversation for once, and for what?

1122
01:24:45,998 --> 01:24:50,253
How am I supposed to enjoy a Broadway show
with my children and their pot?

1123
01:24:50,336 --> 01:24:51,879
Ma, I don't smoke pot!

1124
01:24:51,963 --> 01:24:53,941
Well, your sister comes in here
smelling like a gypsy.

1125
01:24:53,965 --> 01:24:56,259
Well, I'm not my sister.
I'm always being accused.

1126
01:24:56,342 --> 01:24:59,220
Oh! Poor you!

1127
01:25:26,163 --> 01:25:27,999
Don't look so blue, kid.

1128
01:25:28,082 --> 01:25:31,460
- You and me'll cut out, go play catch.
- It's raining.

1129
01:25:31,544 --> 01:25:33,313
Sa benedica,
gets put in the ground,

1130
01:25:33,337 --> 01:25:34,737
all they want to do is eat my food.

1131
01:25:36,424 --> 01:25:39,051
It's not an Irish wake, right,
no food.

1132
01:25:39,135 --> 01:25:42,096
You get carried to your car.
Watch your step there, boss.

1133
01:25:46,267 --> 01:25:48,561
- How you doing?
- How you been?

1134
01:25:53,941 --> 01:25:55,443
Eckley, how's the boy?

1135
01:25:55,526 --> 01:25:57,778
Wonder what they talk about in there?

1136
01:26:07,038 --> 01:26:09,623
Uncle dick,
can I talk to you for a minute?

1137
01:26:09,707 --> 01:26:11,542
What's up, Joe cocker?

1138
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:13,210
All right, I'm gonna wait in the car.

1139
01:26:13,711 --> 01:26:15,588
You help her? Help her.

1140
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:17,214
Well, spit it out.

1141
01:26:18,716 --> 01:26:20,718
You ever heard of this?

1142
01:26:22,261 --> 01:26:23,971
Yeah, so, what about it?

1143
01:26:24,055 --> 01:26:25,890
Well, my mom's been
in a bad mood lately.

1144
01:26:25,973 --> 01:26:27,350
Lately?

1145
01:26:27,433 --> 01:26:30,603
The doctor said that this medicine
could help her, but she won't take it.

1146
01:26:31,437 --> 01:26:32,938
So what do you want from me?

1147
01:26:33,022 --> 01:26:35,816
So I was thinking maybe you could
talk to her.

1148
01:26:36,275 --> 01:26:37,526
What about your old man?

1149
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:40,237
Nah, she's not speaking to him.
He did something.

1150
01:26:40,321 --> 01:26:41,947
I see the way she looks at you.

1151
01:26:42,031 --> 01:26:44,200
Always sits next to you at dinners.

1152
01:26:44,283 --> 01:26:46,285
She bought you that fur hat
for Christmas...

1153
01:26:46,369 --> 01:26:48,120
I never wear it.

1154
01:26:48,204 --> 01:26:51,123
I mean... she looks up to you.

1155
01:26:51,207 --> 01:26:53,334
And maybe you could get her some.

1156
01:26:53,417 --> 01:26:55,795
You need a prescription.
I can't get it in my own name.

1157
01:26:55,878 --> 01:26:58,631
- I know you can get anything.
- Don't be a wise ass.

1158
01:26:58,714 --> 01:27:01,592
I'm not, I'm just saying
it could make her happy.

1159
01:27:01,675 --> 01:27:03,844
- Even Janice says.
-janice.

1160
01:27:03,928 --> 01:27:05,930
There's somebody
we all want to take advice from.

1161
01:27:08,182 --> 01:27:09,642
Anthony!

1162
01:27:10,309 --> 01:27:13,479
The pros play in the rain.

1163
01:27:13,562 --> 01:27:15,898
- Ah, what are you doing, jun'?
- -uncle jun'!

1164
01:27:19,819 --> 01:27:21,862
- -Oh, Madonna Mia!
- Stay down.

1165
01:27:21,946 --> 01:27:23,197
- Don't move him!
- Uncle jun'!

1166
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:24,865
I just said don't move him!

1167
01:27:24,949 --> 01:27:28,244
Your sister's cunt!

1168
01:27:28,327 --> 01:27:31,205
- Corrado!
- I'm calling an ambulance. God damn it.

1169
01:27:31,288 --> 01:27:33,374
Here you go. Here you go.

1170
01:27:33,457 --> 01:27:35,126
- Take my hand.
- Cocksucker!

1171
01:27:55,104 --> 01:27:57,898
These are frank Sinatra, Jr. tickets
for your uncle.

1172
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:01,026
I gotta fly down to the dog track.

1173
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:05,424
They boast a string
of hits that seems to have no end,

1174
01:28:05,448 --> 01:28:09,118
out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
the mighty delfonics.

1175
01:28:11,245 --> 01:28:13,831
Hey, kid. How's your rash?

1176
01:28:14,665 --> 01:28:16,292
Uncle Dickie around?

1177
01:28:21,005 --> 01:28:22,173
Hey.

1178
01:28:28,888 --> 01:28:31,640
Mezzanine? What the fuck.

1179
01:28:32,641 --> 01:28:35,603
- -What?
- That medicine.

1180
01:28:37,062 --> 01:28:39,773
You nervous Nellie, I got stuff to do.

1181
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:45,196
Hey, hey, come here.

1182
01:28:45,863 --> 01:28:47,573
I want to show you something.

1183
01:28:55,247 --> 01:28:57,917
Holy shit. Jbls.

1184
01:29:00,127 --> 01:29:02,463
A pair of them are yours to take home.

1185
01:29:03,339 --> 01:29:05,216
Yeah, well, they're hot.

1186
01:29:05,299 --> 01:29:07,510
Eh, fell off a truck.

1187
01:29:07,593 --> 01:29:09,220
Far out, man.

1188
01:29:11,514 --> 01:29:12,723
Oh-oh!

1189
01:29:13,516 --> 01:29:15,100
Ten-inch woofers.

1190
01:29:17,269 --> 01:29:20,397
I want to go to college.
I can't get caught with shit like this.

1191
01:29:20,481 --> 01:29:25,653
Okay, my friend hesh...
Says only goys and children pay retail.

1192
01:29:25,736 --> 01:29:28,656
This isn't wholesale,
it's totally on the arm.

1193
01:29:31,742 --> 01:29:32,952
Look...

1194
01:29:33,619 --> 01:29:36,664
You want to be a civilian,
I appreciate that. I'm all for it.

1195
01:29:37,248 --> 01:29:39,583
But pay attention to me for once, okay?

1196
01:29:39,667 --> 01:29:41,418
You take the speakers, right?

1197
01:29:41,502 --> 01:29:44,797
At the same time, you promise yourself
these speakers are it.

1198
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,340
Now, you say to yourself,

1199
01:29:46,423 --> 01:29:48,676
"this is the last time
I'm ever gonna steal something."

1200
01:29:48,759 --> 01:29:50,344
And you stick to it.

1201
01:29:52,846 --> 01:29:54,557
It's that simple.

1202
01:30:18,372 --> 01:30:20,583
Maybe I should get on top.

1203
01:30:37,099 --> 01:30:39,810
Fucking Dickie moltisanti!

1204
01:30:44,273 --> 01:30:46,066
It's more than a month now!

1205
01:30:46,150 --> 01:30:47,901
For god's sake, corrado.

1206
01:30:47,985 --> 01:30:50,696
He didn't push you down the stairs,
you slipped.

1207
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:52,781
He got a good laugh out of it, though.

1208
01:30:57,995 --> 01:31:00,247
Any excuse not to fuck.

1209
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,771
They don't vote the motherfucker
out of the white house,

1210
01:31:06,795 --> 01:31:09,381
somebody gonna assassinate his lying ass.

1211
01:31:09,465 --> 01:31:11,300
Azalea, you got it!

1212
01:31:13,093 --> 01:31:17,765
Say, hey! There's my farm boy
from the garden state.

1213
01:31:17,848 --> 01:31:19,391
Where's my tomatoes?

1214
01:31:19,475 --> 01:31:20,809
Brought you collard Greens.

1215
01:31:20,893 --> 01:31:22,311
Ah, now you talkin'.

1216
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:26,565
Sit down.

1217
01:31:26,649 --> 01:31:28,442
Have a hot chocolate and baileys.

1218
01:31:28,525 --> 01:31:31,278
- So, we square?
- -Ooh, Chanel.

1219
01:31:37,326 --> 01:31:39,244
Small bills. You're doing good.

1220
01:31:39,328 --> 01:31:42,706
Soon I'll be in the stratosphere with you.
Call me buzz aldrin.

1221
01:31:42,790 --> 01:31:46,210
Well, buzz, gonna hype you again.
State lottery's coming.

1222
01:31:46,835 --> 01:31:50,089
Your woman's not gonna be wearing
French footwear very long.

1223
01:31:50,172 --> 01:31:53,133
Now, with smack,
you got white kids coming in

1224
01:31:53,217 --> 01:31:57,262
from long island, New Jersey,
Westchester to the east village,

1225
01:31:57,346 --> 01:32:00,683
paying thirty bucks
to stick their arm in a hole.

1226
01:32:00,766 --> 01:32:05,729
Invisible person on the other side
finds a vein, shoots 'em up...

1227
01:32:07,690 --> 01:32:09,608
Should tell you something
about the future.

1228
01:32:09,692 --> 01:32:12,194
You make a good point. We'll talk.

1229
01:32:12,277 --> 01:32:13,737
Thanks.

1230
01:32:15,781 --> 01:32:17,700
This week I gotta...

1231
01:32:17,783 --> 01:32:21,787
Gotta do something about this
Guinea motherfucker or he'll do me.

1232
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:25,416
- -Ah. Dimeo?
- Nah, Dickie moltisanti.

1233
01:32:26,959 --> 01:32:29,545
Controls the numbers,
whole rest of Newark.

1234
01:32:29,628 --> 01:32:31,672
You maybe need an assist on the play?

1235
01:32:34,425 --> 01:32:36,093
Why would you want to do that for me?

1236
01:32:37,136 --> 01:32:39,722
I got my own issues
with the five families.

1237
01:32:40,389 --> 01:32:42,266
I appreciate it, frank, but...

1238
01:32:43,183 --> 01:32:44,893
Terms of the community.

1239
01:32:45,644 --> 01:32:47,354
I'd better do this myself.

1240
01:32:48,939 --> 01:32:50,274
Darryl.

1241
01:32:57,114 --> 01:32:58,907
Merry Christmas, buzz.

1242
01:34:03,555 --> 01:34:05,557
I'm so hungry.

1243
01:34:07,768 --> 01:34:09,186
I got news.

1244
01:34:10,312 --> 01:34:13,690
That beauty parlor? I took it over.

1245
01:34:15,734 --> 01:34:18,320
- For me?
- We'll be partners.

1246
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:20,906
It'll be in my name, but you'll run it.

1247
01:34:20,989 --> 01:34:23,700
Exactly how you want it.
I'll be hands off.

1248
01:34:29,790 --> 01:34:31,792
Oh, Dickie!

1249
01:35:23,927 --> 01:35:26,638
Hey, what did the bartender say
when the horse came in?

1250
01:35:26,722 --> 01:35:28,348
"Why the long face?"

1251
01:35:29,308 --> 01:35:32,394
- You told me that a million times.
- Yeah, so?

1252
01:35:32,477 --> 01:35:34,146
Why the long face?

1253
01:35:35,564 --> 01:35:39,610
I'm all, uh... intronata.

1254
01:35:39,693 --> 01:35:42,362
You're mixed up?
Well, what are you mixed up about?

1255
01:35:44,072 --> 01:35:45,699
So many things.

1256
01:35:45,782 --> 01:35:47,635
Ten minutes ago you were
laughing like an idiot.

1257
01:35:47,659 --> 01:35:48,911
What did I do?

1258
01:35:49,578 --> 01:35:51,538
The beauty parlor.

1259
01:35:51,622 --> 01:35:54,666
The beaut...?
I thought that's what you wanted.

1260
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:56,710
More than anything.

1261
01:35:57,210 --> 01:36:01,632
But now we partners in business.
It's like a marriage.

1262
01:36:04,593 --> 01:36:07,471
I'm alone. So much.

1263
01:36:09,890 --> 01:36:11,600
I get lonely.

1264
01:36:13,435 --> 01:36:15,437
Maybe you didn't love me anymore.

1265
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:19,441
Hey, if I don't love you anymore,
you won't mistake it for a maybe.

1266
01:36:23,236 --> 01:36:25,238
Someone else came along.

1267
01:36:31,286 --> 01:36:33,664
I said yes.

1268
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:40,253
Don't make me say.

1269
01:36:41,797 --> 01:36:44,132
What, you said, "yes, come fuck me?"

1270
01:36:45,092 --> 01:36:47,135
Is that what you're trying to say?
What else, yes?

1271
01:36:47,219 --> 01:36:49,680
It didn't mean anything, Dickie.

1272
01:36:49,763 --> 01:36:51,431
- I love you!
- How many times?

1273
01:36:51,515 --> 01:36:54,101
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

1274
01:36:54,184 --> 01:36:56,103
So many times you can't remember?
Who was he?

1275
01:36:56,186 --> 01:36:58,021
- I doesn't matter, it's over!
- Who was he?

1276
01:36:58,105 --> 01:37:00,232
- I can't!
- Tell me! Fucking tell me.

1277
01:37:00,315 --> 01:37:02,543
- Promise you won't hurt him!
- I don't promise anything,

1278
01:37:02,567 --> 01:37:04,820
but you don't tell me,
it's gonna be worse.

1279
01:37:06,363 --> 01:37:07,614
Harold.

1280
01:37:26,717 --> 01:37:28,552
You fucked that murdering nigger?

1281
01:37:28,635 --> 01:37:32,055
But I don't love him, Dickie!
I love you!

1282
01:37:32,139 --> 01:37:33,807
Please! Don't!

1283
01:37:34,474 --> 01:37:36,601
No, please! No! No!

1284
01:39:29,756 --> 01:39:32,008
One thing
I still miss at Christmas...

1285
01:39:32,592 --> 01:39:35,887
The seven fishes.
My wife used to make it.

1286
01:39:35,971 --> 01:39:37,848
And tripe, too.

1287
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:41,726
She could make those two things,
out of this world.

1288
01:39:43,228 --> 01:39:47,065
You celebrate Christmas with your goomar,
or you stick around home?

1289
01:39:48,525 --> 01:39:50,277
What makes you ask?

1290
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:53,905
I just remember with my girlfriend,
it was always a big argument.

1291
01:39:57,117 --> 01:39:58,493
She died.

1292
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:03,039
80 young.

1293
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:06,501
What happened?

1294
01:40:07,586 --> 01:40:10,797
- Pneumonia.
- Pneumonia?

1295
01:40:11,464 --> 01:40:15,468
She had weak lungs,
from growing up on the other side.

1296
01:40:16,928 --> 01:40:18,930
Fucked up doctors...

1297
01:40:21,057 --> 01:40:23,518
So much tragedy in your life.

1298
01:40:24,561 --> 01:40:27,314
Your father, your mistress...

1299
01:40:28,607 --> 01:40:30,817
I don't even have a picture of her.

1300
01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:38,366
You know, I... I try so hard.

1301
01:40:40,952 --> 01:40:42,954
What kind of god, huh?

1302
01:40:46,958 --> 01:40:49,586
I go to church when joanne wants,

1303
01:40:49,669 --> 01:40:52,964
I try to set an example for my nephew,
I come see you...

1304
01:40:53,048 --> 01:40:55,133
I do all kinds of good things.

1305
01:40:56,927 --> 01:40:59,888
You know the Christmas song,
"my favorite things"?

1306
01:40:59,971 --> 01:41:01,348
Yeah.

1307
01:41:02,307 --> 01:41:05,268
Maybe some of the things
you choose to do...

1308
01:41:06,394 --> 01:41:07,938
Aren't god's favorite.

1309
01:41:10,857 --> 01:41:12,734
What are you trying to say?

1310
01:41:14,611 --> 01:41:18,156
- What do I know?
- I'm a murderer.

1311
01:41:23,453 --> 01:41:25,497
As far as your nephew goes...

1312
01:41:26,122 --> 01:41:27,540
May I make a brief suggestion

1313
01:41:27,624 --> 01:41:30,043
for a nice Christmas present
you could give him?

1314
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:35,257
I'm listening.

1315
01:41:37,175 --> 01:41:39,177
Stay out of his life.

1316
01:41:50,647 --> 01:41:53,650
It's damaged.
And you're out of line with your prices.

1317
01:42:23,763 --> 01:42:26,599
- Who is this?
- Hey, uncle dick, it's Tony.

1318
01:42:26,683 --> 01:42:28,018
How's it going?

1319
01:42:29,853 --> 01:42:31,247
There's a party tonight,
and I was wondering

1320
01:42:31,271 --> 01:42:33,773
if we could get a couple cases
of rolling rock?

1321
01:42:34,983 --> 01:42:36,192
Uncle dick?

1322
01:42:39,237 --> 01:42:42,073
Uncle dick? Hello?

1323
01:42:45,118 --> 01:42:47,078
There's something wrong with his phone.

1324
01:42:47,162 --> 01:42:49,164
Your ass. Same as last time.

1325
01:42:50,915 --> 01:42:52,625
It doesn't have to be rolling rock.

1326
01:42:52,709 --> 01:42:56,421
- Does he know that?
- It's not about the fucking name brand.

1327
01:42:57,297 --> 01:42:58,798
Carmela, you got a dime?

1328
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:16,816
- Hello?
- Hey, aunt Jo.

1329
01:43:16,900 --> 01:43:19,069
It's Tony. Can I speak to uncle dick?

1330
01:43:20,695 --> 01:43:23,573
- I haven't seen him today.
- Yeah?

1331
01:43:25,825 --> 01:43:27,619
Well, how's Christopher?

1332
01:43:28,995 --> 01:43:30,455
You know, the colic?

1333
01:43:30,538 --> 01:43:34,084
For my money, you kids
shouldn't be drinking at your age.

1334
01:43:34,167 --> 01:43:35,794
Give me the goddamn phone.

1335
01:43:44,010 --> 01:43:45,595
Fuck.

1336
01:43:45,678 --> 01:43:47,472
Hey, Joe jerk-off.

1337
01:43:51,601 --> 01:43:53,228
What'd you say?

1338
01:43:53,311 --> 01:43:54,896
I said, hey, Joe jerk...

1339
01:43:54,979 --> 01:43:56,731
- Your sister's twat!
-what?

1340
01:43:58,441 --> 01:43:59,734
Stop it!

1341
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:02,112
Stop it!

1342
01:44:16,501 --> 01:44:17,961
What do you got for us?

1343
01:44:18,044 --> 01:44:20,380
It's what I told you, furniture.
Ethan Allen.

1344
01:44:20,463 --> 01:44:23,550
Dinette sets and, uh, TV trays.

1345
01:44:24,217 --> 01:44:25,552
TV trays?

1346
01:44:25,635 --> 01:44:27,095
I didn't argue.

1347
01:44:27,178 --> 01:44:29,514
Fucking truck's not gonna unload itself.

1348
01:44:33,643 --> 01:44:36,271
- I'll let him know.

1349
01:44:45,822 --> 01:44:48,074
Hey, sil, I need to talk
to my uncle Dickie.

1350
01:44:49,409 --> 01:44:53,121
- He's not here.
- His car's here.

1351
01:44:53,204 --> 01:44:54,831
Battery's dead.

1352
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,543
You know where he is?

1353
01:44:59,085 --> 01:45:01,087
Who am I, rand McNally?

1354
01:45:06,301 --> 01:45:09,637
Okay, well... merry Christmas, sil.

1355
01:45:12,223 --> 01:45:13,892
You too, kid.

1356
01:45:24,861 --> 01:45:29,908
Carmine spotted Harold,
rockhaven motel, down on 46th.

1357
01:45:32,994 --> 01:45:34,829
Well, we'll do it tomorrow.

1358
01:45:36,164 --> 01:45:38,625
I'll pick you up at 10:00
at the pork store.

1359
01:45:42,587 --> 01:45:45,215
It's the kid again.
I told him you're not here.

1360
01:45:48,218 --> 01:45:49,886
Turn the lights out.

1361
01:45:51,095 --> 01:45:53,389
But the guys, they're still unloading.

1362
01:46:38,768 --> 01:46:40,770
You know...

1363
01:47:28,401 --> 01:47:29,694
The fuck are you doing?

1364
01:47:29,777 --> 01:47:31,446
I don't want these!

1365
01:47:37,410 --> 01:47:38,703
Oh!

1366
01:47:38,786 --> 01:47:40,204
That was a gift!

1367
01:47:40,288 --> 01:47:43,124
You take 'em!
I don't want any part of this!

1368
01:47:43,708 --> 01:47:45,388
None of it! I don't want any part of this!

1369
01:47:45,460 --> 01:47:48,504
Huh? What "this"?

1370
01:47:50,798 --> 01:47:52,383
What "this"?

1371
01:47:58,848 --> 01:48:00,266
Night, dick.

1372
01:48:09,275 --> 01:48:10,276
Dick...

1373
01:48:10,985 --> 01:48:14,072
The kid. I don't know
what happened with you two.

1374
01:48:14,781 --> 01:48:18,493
But he worships you.
He's got so much potential.

1375
01:48:18,576 --> 01:48:21,621
Anthony, with that loony toon
of a mother,

1376
01:48:21,704 --> 01:48:24,165
Johnny, who's in line
for a personality transplant...

1377
01:48:24,248 --> 01:48:25,500
What, I'm some kind of example?

1378
01:48:25,583 --> 01:48:27,227
What can I tell you? You're his best shot.

1379
01:48:27,251 --> 01:48:30,088
Ah, I sh-I should
never have let this happen.

1380
01:48:31,673 --> 01:48:34,717
- Get in close.
- Dick, he misses you.

1381
01:48:37,345 --> 01:48:38,596
What?

1382
01:48:41,057 --> 01:48:42,433
Nothing.

1383
01:48:45,853 --> 01:48:49,607
Actually... that's it.

1384
01:48:56,197 --> 01:48:57,448
Nothing.

1385
01:48:59,659 --> 01:49:01,452
I'm not sure I follow.

1386
01:49:02,912 --> 01:49:05,373
- Yeah, well.
-okay...

1387
01:49:07,291 --> 01:49:09,877
I know I shouldn't say this, but...

1388
01:49:09,961 --> 01:49:12,422
Anthony, he could end up somewhere.

1389
01:49:12,505 --> 01:49:13,965
Beyond this thing of ours, even.

1390
01:49:26,018 --> 01:49:28,062
Tell him holsten's, tomorrow.

1391
01:49:28,146 --> 01:49:30,481
- There you go.
- Let me finish, for Christ's sake!

1392
01:49:33,693 --> 01:49:35,862
9:00 am. No later.

1393
01:49:36,571 --> 01:49:38,489
- This is good.
-okay.

1394
01:49:38,573 --> 01:49:40,616
- It's all right, but it...
-okay!

1395
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:42,201
It's over, go home.

1396
01:49:43,995 --> 01:49:47,623
The fuck am I doing? This one's yours.

1397
01:50:33,044 --> 01:50:35,046
{gunshofl

1398
01:50:36,380 --> 01:50:37,882
[Gunshofl

1399
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:55,608
Help! My god!

1400
01:50:56,567 --> 01:50:58,277
Mrs. Moltisanti!

1401
01:51:18,798 --> 01:51:21,801
- Yeah?
- It's done.

1402
01:52:35,791 --> 01:52:37,168
Jun'.

1403
01:52:48,763 --> 01:52:54,352
You know, they found a couple bottles
of that elavil in his coat pocket.

1404
01:52:58,105 --> 01:53:00,983
I used to think Dickie was so strong.

1405
01:53:01,067 --> 01:53:03,945
It shows, you never know about people.

1406
01:53:12,578 --> 01:53:14,580
God, he was my favorite uncle.

1407
01:53:17,416 --> 01:53:20,211
Remember when he used to
take us to the movies?

1408
01:53:20,753 --> 01:53:22,880
Ones mom wouldn't let us go to.

1409
01:53:55,413 --> 01:53:58,499
That's the guy, my uncle Tony.

1410
01:53:58,916 --> 01:54:00,584
The guy I went to hell for.

1411
01:54:14,473 --> 01:54:17,435
Kevin...
Quit bouncing that ball.

1412
01:54:17,518 --> 01:54:19,562
Go do something useful, man.

1413
01:54:25,276 --> 01:54:26,527
Morning.
