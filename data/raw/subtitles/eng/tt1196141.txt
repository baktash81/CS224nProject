1
00:00:30,782 --> 00:00:31,950
<i>Greg?</i>

2
00:00:35,287 --> 00:00:38,207
- G reg?
- What?

3
00:00:38,707 --> 00:00:41,376
- G reg!
- What?

4
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,544
What are you doing? Get up!

5
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:43,921
Mom and Dad have been calling you
for an hour.

6
00:00:44,004 --> 00:00:45,881
You're about to be late for
your first day of middle school.

7
00:00:45,964 --> 00:00:47,299
What?

8
00:00:48,175 --> 00:00:49,885
Oh, geez! How did that happen?

9
00:00:49,968 --> 00:00:51,553
Go, go, go! Mom's about to flip out!

10
00:00:51,637 --> 00:00:54,139
She sent me to get you
while she waits in the car!

11
00:01:34,638 --> 00:01:37,432
What are you doing? What's going on?

12
00:01:37,516 --> 00:01:39,685
Getting ready for...

13
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:46,775
.“school.

14
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:49,778
Are you insane?
School doesn't start till next week.

15
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:53,824
And, FYI, school doesn't start
at 4:00 in the morning!

16
00:01:53,907 --> 00:01:57,327
You woke up Manny.
And if he doesn't go back down...

17
00:01:57,411 --> 00:01:58,453
Good morning!

18
00:01:58,537 --> 00:02:01,331
There is no way he is going back down.

19
00:02:01,415 --> 00:02:02,958
I just wanted to sleep till 6:00.

20
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:05,252
- Bubby!
- Go to bed. I got him.

21
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:07,838
Greg, what are you doing up
making all this noise?

22
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:10,382
It was Rodrick! He woke me up!

23
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:12,509
He changed my clock!

24
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,723
- But I swear, he was just...
- Go to bed.

25
00:02:19,516 --> 00:02:23,186
What is that smell?
I can't even identify it.

26
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,245
Bubby!

27
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:51,965
Happy Birthday!

28
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:53,425
Here, Bubby.

29
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:55,719
Wow! Look at the size
of that flamethrower!

30
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,440
Okay, first of all,
let me get something straight.

31
00:03:08,523 --> 00:03:11,026
This is a journal, not a diary.

32
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,363
Yeah, I know what it says on the cover.

33
00:03:14,446 --> 00:03:16,823
But when my mom went out
to buy this thing,

34
00:03:16,907 --> 00:03:20,369
I specifically told her
not to buy one that said "diary" on it.

35
00:03:20,452 --> 00:03:24,706
This just proves Mom doesn't understand
anything about kids my age.

36
00:03:25,874 --> 00:03:27,209
Sissy!

37
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:31,338
The only reason I agreed to
write in this thing is because

38
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:33,799
when I'm rich and famous
I'll have better things to do

39
00:03:33,882 --> 00:03:36,385
<i>than answer people's stupid questions
all day long.</i>

40
00:03:36,468 --> 00:03:38,345
Gregory, tell us about your childhood!

41
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:40,722
Were you always so smart and handsome?

42
00:03:40,806 --> 00:03:43,100
Here's my journal. Now, shoo, shoo.

43
00:03:45,936 --> 00:03:48,146
That's our boy up there.

44
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,357
Why did I ever say no to him?

45
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,441
Mom got me this thing

46
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:54,277
so I could write down my feelings
about starting middle school.

47
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:56,363
But I'm gonna be fine.

48
00:03:56,446 --> 00:03:59,282
It's my best friend, Rowley Jefferson,
I'm worried about.

49
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:01,576
He's definitely not middle school ready.

50
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,620
Geronimo!

51
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:10,627
He's not quite clear
on the concept of growing up.

52
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,589
I want a puppy, a kitty,
a gumball machine...

53
00:04:14,673 --> 00:04:17,592
But anyway, this is about me, not Rowley.

54
00:04:17,676 --> 00:04:20,429
I always figured
they'd make a movie about my life.

55
00:04:20,512 --> 00:04:23,598
But I didn't think
they'd start the story here.

56
00:04:23,682 --> 00:04:26,852
Because, seriously,
who wants to see a movie about a kid

57
00:04:26,935 --> 00:04:29,813
who's stuck in middle school
with a bunch of morons?

58
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:57,048
Three days, no shower. Smell the love!

59
00:04:57,132 --> 00:04:59,050
Let me go, Rodrick!

60
00:05:00,802 --> 00:05:03,638
Come on.
We're just having some fun, right?

61
00:05:03,722 --> 00:05:05,557
No, okay. So, look.

62
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,227
Mom asked me to give you some advice
about middle school.

63
00:05:09,978 --> 00:05:12,147
It's real simple.

64
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,484
Don't talk to anyone. Don't look at anyone.
Don't go anywhere.

65
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:19,821
Don't sit down. Don't raise your hand.
Don't go to the bathroom.

66
00:05:19,905 --> 00:05:24,034
Don't get noticed.
Don't choose the wrong locker. Don't...

67
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,661
Who am I kidding?

68
00:05:26,745 --> 00:05:29,623
You'll be dead or homeschooled
by the end of the year, anyway.

69
00:05:29,706 --> 00:05:32,042
And don't be seen with Rowley.

70
00:05:44,012 --> 00:05:45,722
Manny, stop it! Mom!

71
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:46,890
Thanks for the eggs, Mom.

72
00:05:46,973 --> 00:05:48,391
- Frank?
- G reg?

73
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:50,101
I think it's gross and undignified

74
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:53,021
that I have to eat breakfast
next to him on the potty.

75
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:55,440
Okay, well, it's your fault
he's still potty training.

76
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:57,359
Don't look down, Manny.

77
00:05:57,442 --> 00:06:00,946
The potty monster doesn't like it
when you look at him.

78
00:06:02,531 --> 00:06:04,074
I was just joking with him.

79
00:06:04,157 --> 00:06:07,452
Okay. Kiss him you're sorry
and then let's get a move on.

80
00:06:07,536 --> 00:06:10,205
Can't be late for your first day of school.

81
00:06:26,096 --> 00:06:29,057
<i>Let me just say for the record
that I think middle school may be</i>

82
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,184
<i>the dumbest idea ever invented.</i>

83
00:06:31,268 --> 00:06:33,645
<i>You got kids like me
who haven't hit their growth spurt yet</i>

84
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:36,815
<i>mixed in with gorillas
who have to shave twice a day.</i>

85
00:06:37,691 --> 00:06:41,861
<i>There's juvenile delinquents and weirdos.</i>

86
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:44,364
<i>I'm smaller than about
95% of the kids at my school...</i>

87
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:45,740
Give it back! Stop!

88
00:06:45,824 --> 00:06:48,910
<i>So thank God for Chirag Gupta.</i>

89
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:51,079
- It's mine! Stop!
- Can I have the backpack?

90
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:52,414
- You got to jump higher.
- It's not yours!

91
00:06:52,497 --> 00:06:54,833
<i>He's an excellent buffer
between me and these morons.</i>

92
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,543
Hey, Greg.

93
00:06:56,626 --> 00:06:59,421
Hey, fella!

94
00:06:59,713 --> 00:07:03,174
<i>Seriously, I don't know what happened
to these kids over the summer.</i>

95
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:06,886
<i>Was there a nuclear accident?</i>

96
00:07:08,054 --> 00:07:10,557
<i>Science experiment gone bad?</i>

97
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,061
<i>Thank God there are a few normal people
or this place would be a total freak show.</i>

98
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:20,859
<i>If you're as discriminating as I am,</i>

99
00:07:20,942 --> 00:07:25,071
<i>it can be tough to figure out where to sit
on your first day of middle school.</i>

100
00:07:25,155 --> 00:07:26,406
<i>One bad move</i>

101
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:30,493
<i>and you're stuck next to some idiot
for the rest of the year.</i>

102
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,376
Greg!

103
00:07:39,336 --> 00:07:42,505
<i>Remember how I said
Rowley wasn't middle school ready?</i>

104
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,842
<i>Well, there you go.</i>

105
00:07:51,056 --> 00:07:52,515
What are you wearing?

106
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:56,853
My family just got back from Guatemala!
It's my serape!

107
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,315
Nice, huh?

108
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:04,819
All right, class, I'm Mrs. Flint.
Everybody take your seats!

109
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:11,201
Welcome to your first day
of middle school.

110
00:08:11,284 --> 00:08:13,953
Remember your seats.
You'll be sitting here every day.

111
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:17,791
Rowley, if you had to say
where you were ranked

112
00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:20,627
in terms of popularity from one to 200,

113
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,253
where would you put yourself?

114
00:08:23,171 --> 00:08:25,256
Is 200 good or bad?

115
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:29,177
I'd say you're somewhere
around the 154 mark.

116
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:32,972
<i>I'd put myself around number 19 or 20.</i>

117
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:37,018
I might even have a shot at the top spot
by the end of the year,

118
00:08:37,102 --> 00:08:39,145
if things go the way I think they will.

119
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:41,272
Well, who's at the bottom?

120
00:08:41,773 --> 00:08:44,776
Hey, guys, wanna see my secret freckle?

121
00:08:45,985 --> 00:08:49,781
<i>Fregley. Sent home for hygiene issues
at least once a month.</i>

122
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:57,580
Check it out. It's got a hair in it!

123
00:08:57,664 --> 00:09:00,333
What color is that?

124
00:09:03,503 --> 00:09:05,255
You wanna help me name it?

125
00:09:05,338 --> 00:09:07,966
All right, ladies! Gather around!

126
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:10,802
Come on, put the knitting down! Let's go!

127
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:15,598
All right, everybody.

128
00:09:15,682 --> 00:09:18,601
I'm Coach Malone
and I am your gym teacher.

129
00:09:18,685 --> 00:09:20,395
P.E. is as much a part of my life

130
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:23,606
as waking up in the morning
and going to the bathroom.

131
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,277
I live and breathe Physical Education.

132
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:29,446
Now, who's with me?

133
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:30,822
Are you ready to have some fun out there?

134
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:31,948
Yeah!

135
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:33,783
All right, outstanding!

136
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:35,243
So we're gonna divide you up
into two teams.

137
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:38,371
So you two, over here.
You, you, you, this way.

138
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:40,749
Yeah, you three, this side. Good.

139
00:09:40,874 --> 00:09:43,752
You guys are going to be Shirts!

140
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:47,672
And you will be Skins.

141
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:53,678
Why are we Skins? I hate this.

142
00:09:53,762 --> 00:09:56,598
He's just trying to make
kids like us feel bad.

143
00:09:56,681 --> 00:09:58,224
What do you mean, kids like us?

144
00:09:58,308 --> 00:10:00,101
I just don't want to get a sunburn,
right, Rowley?

145
00:10:00,185 --> 00:10:03,313
My name is Bell E. Button.

146
00:10:03,396 --> 00:10:04,689
What's yours?

147
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:10,403
Okay, let's start off with a little game
I like to call Gladiator.

148
00:10:12,113 --> 00:10:13,573
- I got this one!
- No!

149
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:15,867
Take that!

150
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:25,835
Cover me!

151
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:32,217
Oh, God.

152
00:10:38,181 --> 00:10:39,557
Not good!

153
00:10:39,641 --> 00:10:42,477
We're never going to be able
to outrun these guys!

154
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,686
We don't have to outrun them!

155
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,605
We just have to outrun Chirag!

156
00:10:59,536 --> 00:11:01,621
- Think they saw us?
- No way.

157
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:03,957
They were focused on
getting that kid with the limp.

158
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,127
We'll hide here for the rest of the class
because I'm not playing that game.

159
00:11:08,211 --> 00:11:09,420
It's not fair.

160
00:11:09,504 --> 00:11:12,924
He's got all the Neanderthals
on the same team. It's barbaric!

161
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:15,134
It's completely barbaric.

162
00:11:17,262 --> 00:11:19,764
This place is an intellectual wasteland.

163
00:11:19,848 --> 00:11:21,516
But, you know, it's nice to meet someone

164
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:24,519
more interested in his mind
than in his body.

165
00:11:24,894 --> 00:11:28,314
You girls get to jump rope.
What are you doing hiding?

166
00:11:28,398 --> 00:11:30,191
Avoiding the pain.

167
00:11:31,276 --> 00:11:33,528
It all starts in middle school, you know?

168
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:36,155
You're not a kid any more.
The coddling has stopped.

169
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:40,451
Kids are now separated by intelligence.
The weak are picked on.

170
00:11:40,535 --> 00:11:45,582
And girls you've known since kindergarten
won't even talk to you any more.

171
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:49,210
Okay, well,
sounds like you got it all figured out,

172
00:11:49,294 --> 00:11:51,421
so go back to your book.

173
00:11:51,504 --> 00:11:53,715
This place is a glorified holding pen.

174
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:57,510
All the way! All the way!
You're like a machine!

175
00:11:57,594 --> 00:11:58,720
It's where adults put you

176
00:11:58,803 --> 00:12:02,891
as you make that awkward transition
between child and teenager

177
00:12:02,974 --> 00:12:05,476
so they don't even have to look at you.

178
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:08,521
Hi. I'm Angie.

179
00:12:09,147 --> 00:12:11,774
Great story. We're gonna go now.

180
00:12:11,858 --> 00:12:14,402
Why? This is a good spot.

181
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:16,696
It's a perfect spot.

182
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:19,032
I survived all of the sixth grade here.

183
00:12:19,115 --> 00:12:21,534
And I would enjoy
some like-minded company

184
00:12:21,618 --> 00:12:23,661
to get me through the seventh.

185
00:12:23,745 --> 00:12:26,956
Is that the whistle?
I think I hear the whistle.

186
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,082
We need to go.

187
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,585
No showboating, all right?

188
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:32,128
Why are we leaving?

189
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:34,213
We could get killed out here in the open!

190
00:12:34,297 --> 00:12:37,216
Put your shirt on.
They'll think we're on their team.

191
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,346
Besides, getting crushed is better than
being seen with that freak job.

192
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:44,349
Trust me, you can't recover
from social suicide.

193
00:12:44,682 --> 00:12:47,685
I never talked to a girl that long before.

194
00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:50,313
Whoa.

195
00:12:51,356 --> 00:12:53,232
Check that out.

196
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:05,870
Isthatcheese?

197
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:13,711
Stop!

198
00:13:14,087 --> 00:13:17,966
Good God, man!
You almost got the Cheese Touch.

199
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:21,219
- The what?
- The Cheese Touch.

200
00:13:21,302 --> 00:13:23,471
Nobody knows when or how,

201
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:28,226
but one day that cheese
mysteriously appeared on the blacktop.

202
00:13:29,227 --> 00:13:31,521
<i>Nobody knew who it belonged to.</i>

203
00:13:31,604 --> 00:13:35,400
<i>Nobody touched it. Nobody threw it</i> away.

204
00:13:35,483 --> 00:13:37,026
<i>And so there it sat,</i>

205
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,530
<i>growing more foul
and powerful by the day.</i>

206
00:13:40,613 --> 00:13:46,327
<i>Then one day, a kid named Darren Walsh
made the biggest mistake of his life.</i>

207
00:13:46,911 --> 00:13:48,997
Darren touched the cheese!

208
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,166
No, I didn't! I just looked at it! Really!

209
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,003
<i>Darren had the Cheese Touch!</i>

210
00:13:55,086 --> 00:13:57,880
<i>It was worse than nuclear cooties.</i>

211
00:13:58,923 --> 00:14:01,009
<i>He became an outcast.</i>

212
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,555
<i>The only way to get rid of
the Cheese Touch</i>

213
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:08,433
<i>was by passing it on to someone else.</i>

214
00:14:13,104 --> 00:14:16,524
<i>And so began the Cheese Touch Frenzy.</i>

215
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:18,693
<i>Friend turning on friend.</i>

216
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:20,445
<i>Brother turning on sister.</i>

217
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:22,405
<i>It was madness.</i>

218
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:28,453
Until a German exchange student
named Dieter Muller took it away.

219
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:30,329
Dieter has the Cheese Touch!

220
00:14:30,413 --> 00:14:32,081
Ze Cheese Touch?

221
00:14:32,165 --> 00:14:33,750
Vat is it?

222
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,210
Vat does it mean, ze Cheese Touch??

223
00:14:36,294 --> 00:14:40,298
Sadly for Dieter,
that fact was lost in translation.

224
00:14:41,007 --> 00:14:42,050
Nooooooooo...!

225
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:45,178
<i>Thankfully, he moved back to Dusseldorf
and took the Cheese Touch with him.</i>

226
00:14:48,473 --> 00:14:53,436
And so the cheese sits,
patiently waiting for its next victim.

227
00:14:56,272 --> 00:14:58,900
This is a terrible place.

228
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,297
- No doors?
- None.

229
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,050
I'm not pooping until I'm in high school.

230
00:15:25,176 --> 00:15:29,263
<i>The cafeteria,
possibly the cruelest place on Earth.</i>

231
00:15:29,764 --> 00:15:33,601
<i>But I was about to make some kid's day
by sitting next to him.</i>

232
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:35,019
That seat's saved.

233
00:15:35,603 --> 00:15:37,105
For who?

234
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:38,689
It's saved.

235
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:43,194
That one's saved, too.

236
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:46,197
So not happening.

237
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:49,408
Taken.

238
00:15:51,327 --> 00:15:53,454
Where are we supposed to eat?

239
00:16:04,757 --> 00:16:07,552
I guess this is
where all the cool guys hang out.

240
00:16:13,391 --> 00:16:17,937
<i>Fregley must have bumped his head
when he was little, like, really hard.</i>

241
00:16:27,113 --> 00:16:29,407
<i>Okay, Okay,</i>

242
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,326
<i>so my first day could have gone better,</i>

243
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,412
<i>but at least I wasn't humiliated.</i>

244
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:38,332
Hey, Greg!
You want to come over and play?

245
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:46,841
What did he just say to you?

246
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:49,510
I think my ride's here.

247
00:16:49,594 --> 00:16:53,306
Hey, guys. So this guy says to that guy,

248
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:56,642
"You wanna come over and play?."

249
00:16:56,726 --> 00:16:59,312
Yeah! Do you guys wanna play with us?

250
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:01,939
<i>See? This is the problem.</i>

251
00:17:02,023 --> 00:17:04,942
<i>Right now I have to take abuse
from these morons.</i>

252
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:08,404
<i>But in 20 years,
Quentin here will be working for me.</i>

253
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:11,616
Greg, please don't fire me.

254
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:15,494
I really need my measly, pathetic job
scooping your dog's poop.

255
00:17:15,578 --> 00:17:17,371
Whatever. I'll think about it.

256
00:17:18,623 --> 00:17:22,210
No, no, no. Vanilla on the bottom
and chocolate on the top!

257
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:23,961
I can't eat this!

258
00:17:24,337 --> 00:17:26,505
Play," Rowley? "Play"?

259
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:30,968
I've told you, like, a billion times that
guys our age say "hang out," not "play."

260
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:35,389
Seriously, if you're not gonna
listen to me, just tell me,

261
00:17:35,473 --> 00:17:37,808
'cause if you pull another stunt like that,

262
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:41,729
we'll be stuck on the cafeteria floor
for the rest of middle school.

263
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:44,148
I found half a Snickers bar down there.

264
00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:47,818
I can't be the guy who eats off his lap
in the cafeteria.

265
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:50,404
I should be
at the top of the food chain by now.

266
00:17:50,488 --> 00:17:53,157
Something's got to change, fast.

267
00:17:53,241 --> 00:17:56,202
My mom told me to just be myself
and people would like me.

268
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:04,126
That would be good advice
if you were somebody else.

269
00:18:20,351 --> 00:18:22,186
Hey, little brother.

270
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:24,855
Was your first day as crappy
as I said it would be?

271
00:18:24,939 --> 00:18:28,234
No. Not at all. You were wrong.

272
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:30,820
- It was actually better than I...
- Worse.

273
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,365
You didn't listen to me, did you?

274
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:38,369
I told you not to talk, look
or go anywhere, and what happened?

275
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:40,871
He had to eat his lunch on the floor.

276
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:42,999
- Rowley.
- Perfect.

277
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,084
And if nobody wants you
sitting at their table,

278
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:47,670
you think they want
Chummy Buttons over here?

279
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:51,549
I was right. You're not even gonna
make it out of there alive.

280
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:53,551
The only chance you have
of making the yearbook is

281
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:56,012
when they dedicate it to your memory.

282
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:03,811
<i>So you wanna play Twisted Wizard?</i>

283
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:07,565
No. I have a better idea.

284
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,987
If he catches you in
here, he will kill you.

285
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,739
Literally, kill you.

286
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:17,950
Don't worry.
As long as we hear the music, we're okay.

287
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:21,537
Whoa. Yeah. Wow.

288
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,540
I didn't know Rodrick
was into motorcycles.

289
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:27,168
- I found it.
- Found what?

290
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:29,587
Rodrick's middle school yearbook.

291
00:19:31,464 --> 00:19:33,549
This thing holds all the answers.

292
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:35,801
Rowley, this thing is like a bible.

293
00:19:35,885 --> 00:19:39,388
See this? This is where
a person like me needs to be.

294
00:19:42,475 --> 00:19:44,727
The class favorites.

295
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:48,439
They're the best in their class.

296
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:52,026
These people aren't nobodies.
They're famous.

297
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:55,571
They don't have to worry about
getting a seat in the cafeteria, either.

298
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:58,741
Check this out.
There's tons of things I qualify for.

299
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:02,328
"Most Likely To Succeed," "Best Looking,"
"Class Clown."

300
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:04,705
They should just
give that to me right now.

301
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:06,791
Don't you have to be funny for that?

302
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,378
Hey! We could try for cutest friends!

303
00:20:10,461 --> 00:20:13,798
What did I tell you would happen
if you ever went in my room again?

304
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:16,217
But your band is still playing.

305
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,054
It's the bass solo, Turd Burglar!
Don't you know anything about music?

306
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:23,391
Now, I came up here
to get a new drumstick,

307
00:20:23,474 --> 00:20:26,977
and now, Greg,
since Mom and Dad are gone,

308
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:30,856
I'm going to kill you. Literally, kill you!

309
00:20:31,107 --> 00:20:32,441
I told you.

310
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:33,567
Beat it.

311
00:20:33,651 --> 00:20:37,738
Okay, but I just want to say one thing!

312
00:20:37,822 --> 00:20:39,615
- Run, Greg, run!
- What?

313
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,035
Let go, Baby HiPP°!

314
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:51,544
You're gonna have to come out
sometime, loser!

315
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:54,130
I'll wait here as long as it takes.

316
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:56,382
And then, you're dead.

317
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:12,440
Time out, Rodrick. I have to pee.

318
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:14,984
No time outs. Only death!

319
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:17,987
- But I really have to go.
- Don't care.

320
00:22:06,911 --> 00:22:08,579
Move over! I'm dying.

321
00:22:15,753 --> 00:22:17,254
Got you!

322
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:21,884
Greg, did you throw Manny off his...

323
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:23,636
What is going on?

324
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:26,472
Greg started it.
I just came in here to take a shower.

325
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:29,141
He's lying! He was gonna kill me
'cause I was in his room!

326
00:22:29,225 --> 00:22:31,519
And so you peed on him?

327
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:34,688
Yes. I mean, no. I mean...

328
00:22:35,064 --> 00:22:36,148
Yes.

329
00:22:57,962 --> 00:22:59,964
There's a lot to sign up for.

330
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:02,841
You could be class favorite
in a bunch of things.

331
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:04,343
Jazz dancing!

332
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:05,928
We could do that one together!

333
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:09,890
I can't believe all these activities.
They're all so much work.

334
00:23:09,974 --> 00:23:14,144
Staying after school,
meeting before school, on weekends.

335
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:16,564
What kind of extracurricular activities
are these?

336
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:18,649
Out of my way.

337
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:21,860
Who let you into this school, Greg Heffley?

338
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:24,572
I was thinking the same thing about you,
Patty Farrell.

339
00:23:24,655 --> 00:23:26,740
You listen to me, Greg Heffley.

340
00:23:26,824 --> 00:23:29,535
I'm running for student council president
and I'm warning you,

341
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:31,912
if you get in my way, I will beat you up,

342
00:23:31,996 --> 00:23:34,873
just like I did in kindergarten
and fourth grade.

343
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:41,005
Fourth grade? That one was ugly.

344
00:23:42,006 --> 00:23:45,175
What's her problem?
What did I ever do to her?

345
00:23:45,426 --> 00:23:50,764
Patty, Patty is a fatty,
has a face just like a ratty!

346
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:59,565
Come on, that was pretty funny.
She needs to get a sense of humor.

347
00:23:59,648 --> 00:24:02,943
And I need something to make me
a class favorite.

348
00:24:03,027 --> 00:24:05,029
What about class favorites?

349
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:09,742
Don't you ever say hi or hello
before you start talking?

350
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:11,577
- Hi.
- Hello.

351
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:14,246
Greg's only here because
he really wants to be something...

352
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:15,539
Rowleyl

353
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:19,543
I was just saying that
I would really like to nail these people

354
00:24:19,627 --> 00:24:21,545
because it's so obvious that

355
00:24:21,629 --> 00:24:24,214
they're only doing these activities
to get in the yearbook.

356
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:26,592
You know, I like your point of view.

357
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:30,346
You should sign up for the school paper.
We're the voice of the people.

358
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:34,475
Well, the people are mostly idiots,
so I guess, technically speaking,

359
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:37,519
we're the voice of the people
making fun of the people.

360
00:24:37,603 --> 00:24:42,274
Thanks, but I can't be on the paper
because I'm gonna be in the paper a lot.

361
00:24:42,358 --> 00:24:45,444
So that would be a conflict of interest.

362
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:49,907
You're the people. Got it.

363
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:55,120
Do you believe me now?
That girl is crazy town.

364
00:24:55,204 --> 00:24:57,498
Look! They have wrestling!

365
00:24:58,582 --> 00:25:01,335
That's it! I'm great at wrestling.

366
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:04,672
I've watched it for years,
I know all the moves.

367
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:06,757
Tombstone piledriver.

368
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:09,968
Chair shot.

369
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:13,514
Vader Bomb.

370
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:18,352
Hefﬂey! Hefﬂey! Hefﬂey! Hefﬂey!

371
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:21,313
H efﬂey! H efﬂey! H efﬂey!

372
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:28,320
Okay. Something is very wrong here.

373
00:25:28,946 --> 00:25:31,073
These don't look like
wrestling costumes to me.

374
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:34,910
Welcome to wrestling,
you future Olympians!

375
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:37,705
So, just to make sure
we all get off on the right foot

376
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:40,541
and nobody gets seriously injured,

377
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:42,334
we're gonna teach you a few basic moves.

378
00:25:42,418 --> 00:25:48,215
Remember, this is about
learning the sport and having fun!

379
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:49,758
All right. It's not a competition

380
00:25:49,842 --> 00:25:55,597
because everyone here
is already a superstar to me.

381
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:58,058
Coach Brewer, can you step over here
for a moment,

382
00:25:58,142 --> 00:26:00,310
please, give me a hand? Thanks.

383
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:06,400
That's known as a speed takedown.

384
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:07,985
Nice job, Coach Brewer.

385
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:10,320
Can you get up and come behind me?

386
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:12,740
Put one arm over my shoulder?
Let's go, yeah.

387
00:26:12,823 --> 00:26:14,992
You got it, walk it off, come on.

388
00:26:17,745 --> 00:26:19,830
That was known as the arm drag.

389
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:22,541
Let's give Coach Brewer a hand,
everybody!

390
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:25,335
He's fine.

391
00:26:27,463 --> 00:26:28,922
Yeah, Heffley.

392
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:32,092
What about piledrivers and Vader bombs?

393
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:34,678
That is fake wrestling.

394
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:39,183
This is real wrestling! Let's go!

395
00:26:40,184 --> 00:26:42,811
If I have to wrestle Benny Wells,
he'll kill me!

396
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:44,688
Let's move! Come on!

397
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:48,901
Okay, to keep things fair, I've divided you
into weight categories by your size,

398
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:51,904
so Rottweilers over here.

399
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:53,822
Bulldogs, you stay right there.

400
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:55,532
And we got two.

401
00:26:57,201 --> 00:26:58,952
Chihuahuas. Yeah.

402
00:26:59,203 --> 00:27:00,788
Nice head gear.

403
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:03,207
Thanks. My mom let me borrow it.

404
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:06,293
All right, let's see what you got.

405
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:09,338
Don't worry, Fregley,
I'll take it easy on you.

406
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:12,591
Hey, I wasn't ready!

407
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:16,887
Nobody's keeping score, but that was
a sweet speed takedown, Fregley!

408
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:22,518
This is fun, Greg Hefﬂey!

409
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:25,938
Get off me!

410
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:31,235
- Fregleyl Fregleyl Fregleyl.
- Fregleyl Fregleyl Fregleyl.

411
00:27:32,903 --> 00:27:35,030
Blow the whistle, blow the whistle!

412
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:37,366
All right! Fregleyl.

413
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:42,120
Outstanding!

414
00:27:44,248 --> 00:27:47,501
And let's...
Let's hear it for our other winner.

415
00:27:49,253 --> 00:27:50,921
Yay, Greg!

416
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:53,799
I can't lose to Fregley again.

417
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:55,884
If I get beat by the
weirdest kid in school,

418
00:27:55,968 --> 00:27:58,470
nobody's ever gonna let me
sit at their table.

419
00:27:58,554 --> 00:28:02,099
How are you going to beat him?
It's like he had superhuman strength!

420
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:05,018
I'm not gonna beat him.
I'm gonna gain 10 pounds this week

421
00:28:05,102 --> 00:28:07,145
so I can move up to
the Bulldog weight class.

422
00:28:07,229 --> 00:28:09,940
And then you and I can wrestle each other.

423
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:11,358
Ready?

424
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:13,485
- Can I throw at you now?
- Later.

425
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:16,780
You're better at riding than I am,
and I'm a better thrower.

426
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:32,379
Greg, save some for everybody else,
honey.

427
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:34,381
Can't. I need to bulk up.

428
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:35,507
VVhy?

429
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:39,136
I think your body looks beautiful
just the way it is.

430
00:28:39,261 --> 00:28:42,890
I heard he got his butt kicked at wrestling.
Now what is wrong with you?

431
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:46,310
Why would you sign up for something
you don't have to do?

432
00:28:46,518 --> 00:28:48,770
You signed up for wrestling?

433
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:49,980
Kind of.

434
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:52,608
You never sign up for anything at school.

435
00:28:52,691 --> 00:28:54,651
You fly below the radar.

436
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:57,738
That way you never raise
anyone's expectations.

437
00:28:57,821 --> 00:29:00,824
Thank you, Rodrick,
for those words of motivational wisdom,

438
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:02,910
but perhaps
a better way to look at it is that

439
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:06,163
it's a chance
to learn to excel at something.

440
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:09,541
Well, what could I learn at school
that I can't teach myself?

441
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,210
Well, Greg, I think it's great that

442
00:29:12,294 --> 00:29:14,588
you took the initiative
to learn something new.

443
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:17,841
This is like the first
step to responsibility!

444
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:21,470
My boss's son Will was smaller than you,

445
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:24,348
but he built himself up with the weights!

446
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:26,600
Yeah.
We could get you the same equipment.

447
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:31,104
You could train,
get the right nutrition, cardio.

448
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:35,025
<i>You'd be in tip-top shape just like Will.</i>

449
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:40,113
And it would only take, like, three months.

450
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:46,870
- Three months?
- Yeah.

451
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:50,499
I'll just stick to eating.

452
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:57,547
Well, I don't know
where you put it, Heffley,

453
00:29:57,631 --> 00:30:00,133
but you gained 10 pounds
and joined the Bulldog class.

454
00:30:00,217 --> 00:30:01,385
Yes.

455
00:30:07,975 --> 00:30:10,519
I thought
you didn't gain any weight this week.

456
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:12,396
My mom's ankle weights.

457
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:18,443
All right, bulldog Heffley.
Meet your new opponent.

458
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:23,281
What? But this is boys' wrestling.

459
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,575
Ever hear of Title IX?

460
00:30:25,784 --> 00:30:27,411
Her parents threatened to sue,

461
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:31,331
so you show her
what it's like to wrestle a real live boy.

462
00:30:38,296 --> 00:30:42,092
Come on! What you waiting for?
Don't be such a wuss, Heffley.

463
00:30:42,175 --> 00:30:45,637
- Make your move!
- She's a girl! Where do I grab her?

464
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:51,435
- Stay down!
- Patty, over here!

465
00:30:55,313 --> 00:30:58,275
- Get off of me!
- Can I wrestle somebody good now?

466
00:31:08,577 --> 00:31:10,912
Well, look who's in the paper.

467
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:16,793
Greg! You're famous!
Right on the front page!

468
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:28,555
And if I would have pinned her,
which I could have done easily,

469
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:31,141
you know I would have gotten in trouble
for hurting a girl.

470
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:33,477
Why does she even want to wrestle?

471
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,687
Who knows? Girls are very confusing.

472
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:37,314
Like today,
I heard someone in the hallway say

473
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:41,401
that Bryce Anderson has a cute butt.
What does that even mean?

474
00:31:41,485 --> 00:31:43,904
A butt can't be cute. It's a butt.

475
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:47,157
I know, but that's what they were saying.

476
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,077
I don't see why girls our age
can't talk just like regular people.

477
00:31:55,874 --> 00:31:58,877
So how are you gonna become
a class favorite now?

478
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,672
- Two words. Best Dressed.
- How are you going to do that?

479
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:06,718
Fashion is easy. You wear a shirt
and a tie, and kids are impressed.

480
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:09,346
I'm telling you, this is gonna work.

481
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:34,996
- I told you I was wearing this.
- I know!

482
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,707
- I wanted to be matchers!
- Check them out!

483
00:32:39,584 --> 00:32:43,046
<i>Greg and Rowley sitting in a tree.</i>

484
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,466
K-I-S-S-I-N-G

485
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:48,802
<i>First comes love...</i>

486
00:32:48,885 --> 00:32:51,972
<i>You know,
maybe Rodrick was right about Rowley.</i>

487
00:32:52,848 --> 00:32:55,308
<i>Maybe I do need a new best friend.</i>

488
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:58,145
<i>But I can't just ditch him.</i>

489
00:32:58,228 --> 00:33:01,690
<i>I mean, if anybody has a better idea,
I'd love to hear it.</i>

490
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:05,152
<i>In this school, much like your own,</i>

491
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:07,946
<i>one boy is about to learn
an important lesson</i>

492
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:09,906
<i>about self-worth and esteem.</i>

493
00:33:10,574 --> 00:33:12,159
<i>Gag me with a spoon.</i>

494
00:33:12,242 --> 00:33:15,328
<i>That guy is so unpopular,
I'd hate to be him.</i>

495
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:19,666
<i>Why doesn't anybody like me?</i>

496
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:23,378
<i>Maybe because they don't know
how awesome you really are.</i>

497
00:33:24,254 --> 00:33:27,632
<i>Brock Branigan P. I.!
What are you doing here?</i>

498
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:31,553
<i>I'm here to solve the case of the boy
who just needed to be himself.</i>

499
00:33:31,636 --> 00:33:35,140
<i>So go for it!
Show them how awesome you really are!</i>

500
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,229
<i>Hey, guys. Do you like break dancing?</i>

501
00:33:57,287 --> 00:33:59,539
<i>That is totally rad!</i>

502
00:33:59,623 --> 00:34:02,959
<i>Wicked.
You should sit with us at lunch, friend.</i>

503
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:08,298
<i>Sweet!</i>

504
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:12,469
<i>It really is awesome to be me!
Thanks, Brock.</i>

505
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:28,026
Okay. Let's talk about what we've learned.

506
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:31,196
<i>I don't know about anyone else,
but I know what I learned.</i>

507
00:34:31,279 --> 00:34:33,240
<i>It is awesome to be me.</i>

508
00:34:33,573 --> 00:34:37,160
<i>The problem with Rowley
is that he's not enough like me.</i>

509
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:40,163
<i>I can't ditch him
'cause he'd be lost without me.</i>

510
00:34:41,665 --> 00:34:43,833
<i>But maybe I can fix him.</i>

511
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:49,005
<i>Because that's the kind of friend I am.</i>

512
00:34:49,172 --> 00:34:50,757
What are you doing?

513
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,134
Making your clothes
more middle-school friendly.

514
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:56,805
Look at this stuff. Too babyish and weird.

515
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:00,141
Too "Why don't you just punch me now?".

516
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:04,229
What are you, a foreign exchange student?

517
00:35:05,313 --> 00:35:08,441
Man. This one we burn.

518
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:10,527
That was a present from my mom.

519
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:13,446
Well, then your mom
is trying to get you killed.

520
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:15,282
Ready? Steady. Go.

521
00:35:19,035 --> 00:35:21,955
No, no, no.
You look like one of the Seven Dwarfs.

522
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:25,792
You only need one strap. One strap is cool.

523
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:27,419
But there's two straps.

524
00:35:27,502 --> 00:35:30,588
Why would they put on two straps
if you're only supposed to use one?

525
00:35:30,672 --> 00:35:33,300
Because the guys who make backpacks
aren't cool.

526
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:37,470
If they were cool, they'd give it one
strap, like the cool one-strap guys do.

527
00:35:37,554 --> 00:35:40,307
You know what has one strap?
Machine guns.

528
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:43,310
You know what else? Electric guitars.

529
00:35:43,393 --> 00:35:45,812
- You know what else?
- Purses?

530
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:50,150
- But Joshie is cool.
- Rowley, Joshie is not cool.

531
00:35:50,233 --> 00:35:52,902
He's a lip-synching pop star
whose fans are eight-year-old girls.

532
00:35:53,028 --> 00:35:55,989
You're just jealous
that I was the one who discovered him.

533
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:59,034
Who are you gonna listen to, Rowley?
Me or Joshie?

534
00:35:59,117 --> 00:36:02,662
Joshie says to respect your parents
and follow your dreams.

535
00:36:03,038 --> 00:36:05,415
Then Joshie must get beaten up a lot.

536
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:15,508
You actually almost look as good as me.

537
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:17,719
Am I great at this or what?

538
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:22,140
There's Bryce Anderson. Just be cool.

539
00:36:23,266 --> 00:36:27,187
- Hey, Bryce.
- Yeah, hey, Bryce!

540
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:29,606
Cute butt!

541
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:35,487
You're killing me, you know that?

542
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:38,865
Look, Rowley, tonight's Halloween,
our favorite night of the year,

543
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:43,119
so, just promise me you won't wear,
do or say anything weird.

544
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:49,793
You're kidding me, right?

545
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:53,463
My mom wanted me to be visible at night.

546
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:56,466
From space?

547
00:36:57,384 --> 00:37:00,553
So, we'll hit a few houses
on the way to the North Side,

548
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:02,972
which is where we'll do
most of our trick-or-treating.

549
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:05,558
Why are we going all the way over there?

550
00:37:05,642 --> 00:37:07,227
It's where the rich people live.

551
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:11,231
They hand out, like, two, three pieces
of big candy to each kid.

552
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:13,316
Not that candy corn crap.

553
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:17,695
I'm talking about full-size
Milky Ways and Nutter Butters.

554
00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:19,406
Plus, if we time it right,

555
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:23,660
rich people get tired of answering
their doors and just leave the bowl out.

556
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:25,328
We can clean up.

557
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:28,957
You're lucky.

558
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,960
My mom doesn't let me play
with makeup any more.

559
00:37:32,043 --> 00:37:35,713
Shut up, tool.
Léded Diper's got a gig tonight.

560
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:43,972
Going to the North Side, huh?

561
00:37:44,055 --> 00:37:46,599
Takes you right past
the Devil Worshiper Woods.

562
00:37:46,683 --> 00:37:48,309
The Devil Worshiper Woods?

563
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:50,854
You know about that story, right?

564
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:56,818
Well, there used to be this house
right here where these woods are.

565
00:37:57,402 --> 00:38:01,030
They had to tear it down because
what happened there was so terrible.

566
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:02,615
What happened there?

567
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:07,078
Well, a long time ago,
two kids who were, I don't know,

568
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:09,873
maybe in middle school,

569
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:13,626
they trick-or-treated at that house
on Halloween night.

570
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:19,966
But the house was full of devil worshipers

571
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:24,387
who put the kids
in these giant pizza ovens.

572
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:27,891
And they cooked them and they ate them.

573
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:31,186
But they forgot to turn off the ovens.

574
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:34,564
So the house burned down
with everyone in it.

575
00:38:35,398 --> 00:38:37,442
How'd the trees get there?

576
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:40,820
And then they planted trees.

577
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:45,992
And to this day, on Halloween night,

578
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:51,289
you can still hear the demonic laughter
of the devil worshiper ghosts

579
00:38:51,372 --> 00:38:56,711
as they roam the woods,
looking for more kids to sacrifice!

580
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,089
Hey, Rodrick.
I need you to help me out. Like...

581
00:39:02,675 --> 00:39:05,178
Are you wearing eyeliner?

582
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,597
- Trick or treat.
- Susan!

583
00:39:07,889 --> 00:39:10,433
- I'm on door duty!
- Thank you.

584
00:39:11,851 --> 00:39:13,353
Bubby!

585
00:39:13,561 --> 00:39:15,855
Mom, can you tell him
to stop calling me that?

586
00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:17,524
What if somebody hears?

587
00:39:17,607 --> 00:39:20,401
Then they'll know how much he loves you.

588
00:39:21,486 --> 00:39:24,739
Frank, Frank, honey, honey,
can you go with them?

589
00:39:24,822 --> 00:39:28,034
No, I can't. I got to guard the house
in case someone tries to T.P. us.

590
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:30,995
They're gonna get drenched from the roof.

591
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:33,915
Honey, for goodness sakes,
don't do that again.

592
00:39:33,998 --> 00:39:35,583
Remember what happened last year?

593
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:38,002
<i>L</i> 9011 you!

594
00:39:42,382 --> 00:39:43,508
Hi.

595
00:39:46,469 --> 00:39:48,221
I thought they were teenagers.

596
00:39:48,304 --> 00:39:51,891
And I couldn't see through the bushes.
My legs, they hurt from the squatting.

597
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:55,311
So, that's why
I'm doing it from the roof this year.

598
00:39:55,812 --> 00:39:58,481
So I can see when they're coming.

599
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:04,862
- Can we go now?
- Yes, go.

600
00:40:04,946 --> 00:40:08,449
- But stay in the neighborhood.
- Trick or treat.

601
00:40:08,533 --> 00:40:11,244
- And no North Side!
- We promise!

602
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,596
We got to stay in this neighborhood
the rest of the night.

603
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:32,557
That guy gave me two full-size Snickers!

604
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,728
Did I tell you or did I tell you?
These people have money to burn!

605
00:40:37,895 --> 00:40:39,897
I can't believe we got this much candy.

606
00:40:40,523 --> 00:40:41,899
This is, like, the best day ever.

607
00:40:41,983 --> 00:40:44,944
Hey, reflector dude, nice costume!

608
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:46,863
Thanks! My mom made it...

609
00:40:53,995 --> 00:40:57,832
- That was awesome!
- I saw your plates! We're calling the cops!

610
00:41:02,879 --> 00:41:04,130
Oh, boy.

611
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:07,467
Run!

612
00:41:11,554 --> 00:41:13,473
Hey, they're going through the yard!

613
00:41:13,556 --> 00:41:15,725
Go, go, go, 90, 90, 90, 99!

614
00:41:17,977 --> 00:41:20,813
Where are we going?
We're totally exposed!

615
00:41:23,733 --> 00:41:26,069
- My grandma's house!
- Quickly!

616
00:41:26,903 --> 00:41:28,446
They're coming!

617
00:41:31,491 --> 00:41:33,826
- Hello?
- That's not helping! She's not home!

618
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:35,536
- Bingo night.
- Okay, you guys are dead.

619
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,580
- Open the door! Get the key!
- Okay. Okay.

620
00:41:37,664 --> 00:41:39,332
- Open the door! Get it!
- Come on, let's get them, boys.

621
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:40,917
They're coming!

622
00:41:41,793 --> 00:41:43,586
Now! " 9°'! You now!"

623
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,921
Hey, hey!

624
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:49,258
Come on, you babies!

625
00:41:51,594 --> 00:41:52,720
I'm gonna kick your butts!

626
00:41:54,722 --> 00:41:57,934
- Yeah? You and what army?
- Whatever.

627
00:42:03,773 --> 00:42:06,859
You guys are so lucky you can hide
in there behind your mommy!

628
00:42:06,943 --> 00:42:08,736
No, we aren't! It's not our house!

629
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,656
It's his grandma's
and she's not even home!

630
00:42:15,243 --> 00:42:17,954
What? Why would you tell them that?

631
00:42:18,037 --> 00:42:19,247
Did he just say that?

632
00:42:24,669 --> 00:42:27,880
Now they're never gonna leave.
You need to call your mom to come get us.

633
00:42:27,964 --> 00:42:30,425
Mine'll kill me if she knows we're here.

634
00:42:30,508 --> 00:42:33,761
Mine will, too.
She thinks you're a bad influence.

635
00:42:35,263 --> 00:42:36,681
She's right.

636
00:42:37,974 --> 00:42:39,892
Then we're gonna have to bust out of here.

637
00:42:40,768 --> 00:42:43,980
- You have any threes?
- Go fish.

638
00:42:48,234 --> 00:42:50,153
Hey, what's that?

639
00:43:13,968 --> 00:43:16,345
Just back off!
I don't want to hurt anybody,

640
00:43:16,429 --> 00:43:19,474
we just want to walk away
and forget this ever happened.

641
00:43:19,557 --> 00:43:21,893
Nobody needs to be a hero! Whoa!

642
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:32,111
Are you kidding me?

643
00:43:32,195 --> 00:43:36,783
I'm gonna rip off your arms and punch you
in the face with your own fists!

644
00:43:42,205 --> 00:43:44,207
'They're gaining!
- This way!

645
00:43:50,213 --> 00:43:53,007
The Devil Worshiper Woods! No way!

646
00:43:53,341 --> 00:43:57,220
Hey! Stay right there!
We're gonna get you!

647
00:44:00,014 --> 00:44:02,058
They're going into the woods.

648
00:44:02,141 --> 00:44:05,019
No, no way I go
into Devil Worshiper Woods.

649
00:44:06,854 --> 00:44:08,481
This isn't over!

650
00:44:12,068 --> 00:44:14,904
- I'm really scared!
- Just keep running!

651
00:44:22,745 --> 00:44:25,665
Did you hear that?
It's the devil worshipers.

652
00:44:45,434 --> 00:44:46,602
Guys?

653
00:44:55,069 --> 00:44:56,571
- Are we safe?
- Yeah.

654
00:44:56,696 --> 00:44:59,532
And we made it with still a ton of candy.

655
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:05,788
Sorry. I was...
I thought you were teenagers.

656
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:11,586
- Maybe next year, Pops!
- Hey!

657
00:45:25,892 --> 00:45:29,103
<i>So anyone else
exhibiting symptoms of pink eye</i>

658
00:45:29,186 --> 00:45:31,564
<i>should contact the nurse immediately.</i>

659
00:45:31,647 --> 00:45:34,692
<i>In field trip news,
consent forms are going out today</i>

660
00:45:34,775 --> 00:45:38,070
<i>for our annual
History of Plumbing excursion.</i>

661
00:45:38,154 --> 00:45:39,322
<i>In sports news...</i>

662
00:45:40,323 --> 00:45:45,369
I think Shelly is looking hot today.

663
00:45:46,078 --> 00:45:48,748
- Yeah.
- Are they talking about me?

664
00:45:49,498 --> 00:45:52,168
I don't know. I don't speak Russian.

665
00:45:52,335 --> 00:45:57,506
<i>And finally, some positions
have opened up for the Safety Patrol.</i>

666
00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:01,427
<i>If anyone is interested,
see Mr. Winsky after homeroom.</i>

667
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:03,679
<i>Now that's what I'm talking about.</i>

668
00:46:04,889 --> 00:46:08,184
<i>Safety Patrol. The cops of middle school.</i>

669
00:46:08,976 --> 00:46:15,066
<i>You boss people around, report the jerks,
and miss class three times a week.</i>

670
00:46:19,862 --> 00:46:21,697
Safety Patrol is a sacred trust.

671
00:46:21,781 --> 00:46:25,826
When you put on this vest and that badge
you become a protector of the weak.

672
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:29,497
You become an enforcer of the laws
of this school,

673
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:32,750
because today's litterer and jaywalker

674
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:35,336
is tomorrow's window breaker
and graffiti vandal,

675
00:46:35,419 --> 00:46:37,630
and it's ourjob to stop it.

676
00:46:37,713 --> 00:46:40,716
So I ask you, are you up for the job?

677
00:46:41,717 --> 00:46:43,052
'Yes! 'Yes!

678
00:46:43,886 --> 00:46:46,138
Then welcome to Safety Patrol.

679
00:46:46,222 --> 00:46:49,308
Just remember, with great power...

680
00:46:49,392 --> 00:46:51,978
- Whoa.
- ...comes great responsibility.

681
00:46:53,437 --> 00:46:56,107
Now, you get your first assignment
just after lunch,

682
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:58,234
so you'll be excused
from the first 20 minutes of sixth period.

683
00:46:58,317 --> 00:47:01,153
But that means we'll miss Algebra...

684
00:47:01,237 --> 00:47:02,738
Do we get free stuff?

685
00:47:03,781 --> 00:47:06,409
- Free hot cocoa.
- Could this day get any better?

686
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:08,828
Whoa, is that cocoa?

687
00:47:08,911 --> 00:47:11,747
- Sorry, Safety Patrol only.
- Sorry.

688
00:47:15,251 --> 00:47:19,463
You rejected the school paper,
but you joined the Safety Patrol?

689
00:47:19,547 --> 00:47:21,632
Look, are you working
your way down the evolutionary ladder?

690
00:47:21,716 --> 00:47:22,758
What?

691
00:47:22,842 --> 00:47:26,303
Look, Safety Patrol
is the lowest of the low,

692
00:47:26,387 --> 00:47:29,473
the geekiest of the geeky,
the Island of Misfit Toys.

693
00:47:29,557 --> 00:47:32,393
You're just jealous they don't trust you
to keep our school safe.

694
00:47:32,476 --> 00:47:36,105
Now if you'll excuse me,
I need to secure the perimeter.

695
00:47:40,276 --> 00:47:42,987
- I'm hungry.
- Keep it straight, people.

696
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:45,740
Single-file line, one by one.

697
00:47:53,664 --> 00:47:56,667
Greg! It's those guys from Halloween!

698
00:47:57,793 --> 00:47:59,336
What do we do?

699
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:05,718
Come on, man, just pull my finger.
I swear to God, I'm not gonna do anything.

700
00:48:05,801 --> 00:48:08,554
Everybody, shoulder to shoulder.
Shoulder to shoulder.

701
00:48:08,637 --> 00:48:10,681
- Go. Go!
- Whoa, whoa.

702
00:48:23,319 --> 00:48:26,405
- That was close.
- Too close.

703
00:48:30,326 --> 00:48:33,287
<i>It's times like these that make me realize.</i>

704
00:48:33,454 --> 00:48:36,499
<i>Rowley's pretty lucky
to have me as a friend.</i>

705
00:48:39,043 --> 00:48:42,338
<i>And I got Twisted Wizard Two,
and a new bike!</i>

706
00:48:43,089 --> 00:48:47,259
And we're going to take a family trip
to New York City for New Year's Eve!

707
00:48:47,343 --> 00:48:51,347
- What did you get?
- My dad got me a weight-lifting set.

708
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:54,391
Do you know how many video games
I could've gotten instead?

709
00:48:54,475 --> 00:48:58,479
I had to get out of there
before he expected me to, like, use it.

710
00:48:58,771 --> 00:49:01,941
Anyway, let's play some
<i>Twisted</i> Wizard Two at your house.

711
00:49:02,024 --> 00:49:05,694
Probably not a good idea.
My dad's still annoyed at you.

712
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:07,238
For what?

713
00:49:07,446 --> 00:49:10,199
Remember that secret language
we made up last week?

714
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,954
Your-pa dad-pa smells-pa
like-pa a woman-pa.

715
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,292
I think he cracked our code.

716
00:49:20,376 --> 00:49:22,419
We should probably do something outside.

717
00:49:24,547 --> 00:49:27,466
Why can't you ride
and I throw at you first?

718
00:49:27,883 --> 00:49:30,302
My legs kind of hurt
from walking over here.

719
00:49:47,236 --> 00:49:50,322
Okay, Rowley. Come on. Get up.

720
00:49:51,574 --> 00:49:53,159
Shake it off.

721
00:49:54,493 --> 00:49:58,497
Are you sure the doctor was right?
It really didn't look that broken to me.

722
00:49:58,581 --> 00:50:03,043
Yeah, it's broken. The X-ray never lies.

723
00:50:05,254 --> 00:50:09,216
- Oh, my gosh. What happened?
- I broke it.

724
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,427
- How?
- Big Wheel accident.

725
00:50:13,095 --> 00:50:14,722
You're funny.

726
00:50:14,805 --> 00:50:16,640
- Can I sign your cast?
- Me, too.

727
00:50:16,724 --> 00:50:19,143
- I wanna sign it, too.
- Why, sure.

728
00:50:19,476 --> 00:50:22,021
Hey, I'm the one who broke his hand.

729
00:50:22,771 --> 00:50:24,481
Then you're a jerk.

730
00:50:25,316 --> 00:50:27,109
- Sorry.
- Does it hurt?

731
00:50:30,738 --> 00:50:32,740
Rowley, you're so funny.

732
00:50:34,325 --> 00:50:36,619
<i>- After I stood...
- I couldn't believe it!</i>

733
00:50:36,702 --> 00:50:41,290
<i>Rowley was eating at an actual table
because of something I did!</i>

734
00:50:42,041 --> 00:50:43,792
<i>Where's my credit?</i>

735
00:50:44,126 --> 00:50:47,755
<i>And he's right handed!
He can feed himself just fine.</i>

736
00:50:50,674 --> 00:50:53,802
So, how's that class favorite thing
working out for you?

737
00:50:53,886 --> 00:50:55,137
Great.

738
00:51:12,112 --> 00:51:15,783
<i>I realized Rowley's injury thing
was a pretty good racket.</i>

739
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:23,290
- It's gonna be so much fun.
- Hey, guys. Check it out.

740
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:25,584
Oh, my gosh, what happened?

741
00:51:25,668 --> 00:51:29,922
It's a raging infection caused by a
splinter that was left untreated.

742
00:51:30,339 --> 00:51:33,384
Want to be the first to sign
my sympathy sheet?

743
00:51:33,717 --> 00:51:34,760
No.

744
00:51:38,055 --> 00:51:42,184
I'll sign it, Greg Heffley,
if you'd let me look at your infection.

745
00:51:46,563 --> 00:51:50,150
And on the X-ray, you could see
where the bone just snapped right in half

746
00:51:50,234 --> 00:51:53,946
I had the exact same break last year,
and it got all purple!

747
00:51:54,071 --> 00:51:57,866
- Cool! Mine, too!
- Hey, Gregory, want to sign the card?

748
00:51:58,242 --> 00:52:00,202
You got Rowley a card?

749
00:52:00,369 --> 00:52:02,997
What? No, it's for Bryan Little.

750
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,416
You know, the guy who writes
the Wacky Dawg cartoons

751
00:52:05,499 --> 00:52:07,251
for the school paper?

752
00:52:07,334 --> 00:52:10,879
He has mono and he's going to be out
for three months.

753
00:52:11,338 --> 00:52:13,340
That really stinks.

754
00:52:13,424 --> 00:52:17,177
So, just out of curiosity,
who's gonna do the cartoon?

755
00:52:17,511 --> 00:52:21,724
They're having tryouts, but
the important thing is Bryan gets better.

756
00:52:22,057 --> 00:52:23,392
Absolutely.

757
00:52:25,477 --> 00:52:28,063
<i>Bryan Little getting mono was destiny.</i>

758
00:52:28,188 --> 00:52:31,650
<i>I draw cartoons all the time.
I'm gonna win this.</i>

759
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:46,081
<i>I decided to go ahead and forgive Rowley
for milking the broken hand so hard</i>

760
00:52:46,165 --> 00:52:49,126
<i>and I told him
he could work on the cartoon with me.</i>

761
00:52:50,002 --> 00:52:53,255
So, I was thinking
we could do something like this!

762
00:52:53,589 --> 00:52:55,758
<i>Oops, I stepped in</i> a <i>puddle!</i>

763
00:52:55,841 --> 00:52:58,260
<i>At least it's not an acid puddle.</i>

764
00:52:59,345 --> 00:53:00,846
<i>It is an acid puddle!</i>

765
00:53:00,929 --> 00:53:02,473
<i>Zoo-wee Mama!</i>

766
00:53:04,266 --> 00:53:06,018
Zoo-wee Mama!

767
00:53:07,728 --> 00:53:10,105
It's the same joke every time.

768
00:53:10,189 --> 00:53:12,775
Yeah! Zoo-wee Mama!

769
00:53:13,692 --> 00:53:16,153
We can't just do the same thing
over and over.

770
00:53:16,236 --> 00:53:18,030
We can if it's Zoo-wee Mama.

771
00:53:18,113 --> 00:53:21,075
It has to be a little more sophisticated.

772
00:53:21,408 --> 00:53:24,286
<i>I wonder what is in this cute little box.</i>

773
00:53:24,411 --> 00:53:26,914
<i>It's not a box,
it's a brick, you dumb moron.</i>

774
00:53:26,997 --> 00:53:30,042
<i>Oops! I've been trying to open it all day!</i>

775
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:37,091
- Can he say, "Zoo-wee Mama"?
- No, it's not funny.

776
00:53:37,174 --> 00:53:40,094
Well, I think it is. I like Zoo-wee Mama.

777
00:53:40,219 --> 00:53:44,848
You know what? If you like it so much,
then why don't you go do it yourself?

778
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:51,355
Okay. I will.

779
00:53:52,731 --> 00:53:53,982
See you.

780
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:08,831
Hey, I forgot my raincoat, so I'm gonna
need you to walk the kids home today.

781
00:54:08,914 --> 00:54:13,585
I can't. I can't get my cast wet.
You can borrow my coat.

782
00:54:17,881 --> 00:54:19,883
Where's Rowley?

783
00:54:20,092 --> 00:54:23,637
- He couldn't get his cast wet!
- He walks us better!

784
00:54:30,686 --> 00:54:31,854
Oh, no.

785
00:54:37,443 --> 00:54:39,653
Oh, my gosh! Space monsters!

786
00:54:39,862 --> 00:54:43,949
They're going to eat us,
unless we can get into that hole!

787
00:54:44,116 --> 00:54:47,453
Come on, people, move it!
Now, people! We're gonna get eaten!

788
00:54:47,536 --> 00:54:50,289
Come on! Don't worry!
I'm right behind you!

789
00:54:50,372 --> 00:54:51,707
- Whoa!
- Go!

790
00:55:04,011 --> 00:55:05,137
Hey!

791
00:55:06,054 --> 00:55:08,515
Rowley Jefferson, is that you?

792
00:55:09,725 --> 00:55:12,227
Yes, Mrs. Irvine!

793
00:55:16,023 --> 00:55:17,566
Sorry, kids!

794
00:55:25,699 --> 00:55:27,701
Are you going to eat us?

795
00:55:28,744 --> 00:55:33,165
<i>And though doctors assure us
that Mrs. Cheznik is no longer contagious,</i>

796
00:55:33,248 --> 00:55:37,586
<i>the cafeteria nachos bar will be closed
for the remainder of the week.</i>

797
00:55:37,961 --> 00:55:40,339
<i>And now, what you've all been waiting for.</i>

798
00:55:40,506 --> 00:55:44,510
<i>The faculty, Student Council
and editors have all met</i>

799
00:55:44,593 --> 00:55:47,971
<i>and selected the new cartoonist
for the school paper.</i>

800
00:55:48,931 --> 00:55:54,269
<i>And the winner is
"Zoo-wee Mama" by Rowley Jefferson!</i>

801
00:55:59,107 --> 00:56:01,527
<i>- What?
- That is funny!</i>

802
00:56:02,444 --> 00:56:03,779
Great job.

803
00:56:05,113 --> 00:56:07,783
<i>- Zoo-wee Mama.
- I couldn't believe it.</i>

804
00:56:09,076 --> 00:56:11,411
<i>Am I the only one who gets comedy?</i>

805
00:56:11,495 --> 00:56:14,373
- Rowley, will you put me in your cartoon?
- Sure.

806
00:56:14,456 --> 00:56:17,417
And me, too. I want to be the one
who says, "Zoo-wee Mama."

807
00:56:17,501 --> 00:56:20,295
- You got it!
- Hey, Rowley, congratulations.

808
00:56:20,379 --> 00:56:21,547
- Thanks.
- No problem.

809
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:24,424
You know, I read all the submissions
and yours was by far the best.

810
00:56:24,508 --> 00:56:26,301
I read yours, too.

811
00:56:26,802 --> 00:56:28,720
- Hey, Rowley.
- Hey, Bryce.

812
00:56:29,054 --> 00:56:32,766
- Yeah, hey, Bryce.
- Hey, fella.

813
00:56:33,642 --> 00:56:36,562
Wow. Everyone knows me now.

814
00:56:37,145 --> 00:56:41,858
- It's like I'm famous! Isn't this great?
- Yeah.

815
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:46,154
Rowley Jefferson?
I need to see you in my office, now.

816
00:56:57,791 --> 00:56:59,751
I just took a call from a Mrs. Irvine

817
00:56:59,835 --> 00:57:02,504
about what happened
to the kindergarteners last week.

818
00:57:02,588 --> 00:57:05,340
She was very upset. And so am I.

819
00:57:06,216 --> 00:57:09,344
- What?
- You violated the sacred trust.

820
00:57:10,554 --> 00:57:11,847
This...

821
00:57:14,182 --> 00:57:18,103
This badge is supposed to mean
something, and you just spat on it.

822
00:57:18,186 --> 00:57:20,230
I can barely even look at you.

823
00:57:20,314 --> 00:57:22,649
- I really don't...
- Just save it.

824
00:57:22,858 --> 00:57:25,944
You are officially suspended
from Safety Patrol.

825
00:57:26,361 --> 00:57:29,656
And I expect a full apology
to the kindergarteners.

826
00:57:30,449 --> 00:57:31,742
Yes, sir.

827
00:57:40,667 --> 00:57:45,088
- Hey. What did he have to say?
- I'm kicked off.

828
00:57:45,672 --> 00:57:47,841
I don't even know what he's talking about.

829
00:57:50,969 --> 00:57:52,220
Rowley?

830
00:57:54,264 --> 00:57:57,225
- What?
- Nothing.

831
00:58:13,408 --> 00:58:17,454
You've been home for an hour
and haven't badgered me for any snacks.

832
00:58:17,537 --> 00:58:19,414
Are you feeling okay?

833
00:58:20,624 --> 00:58:24,336
Well, I'm kind of in a tough situation.

834
00:58:25,253 --> 00:58:26,838
I know something

835
00:58:26,922 --> 00:58:30,008
and if I tell the truth about it,
it could hurt somebody.

836
00:58:30,092 --> 00:58:33,220
But if I don't, it could
hurt somebody else.

837
00:58:33,303 --> 00:58:38,642
Well, you have to trust your gut
and try to do the right thing,

838
00:58:40,268 --> 00:58:44,940
because it's our choices
that make us who we are.

839
00:58:47,484 --> 00:58:48,610
Okay.

840
00:58:52,572 --> 00:58:56,451
<i>I was up all night, tossing and turning,
thinking about my mom's advice.</i>

841
00:58:56,535 --> 00:58:59,454
<i>And I finally decided
to do the right thing.</i>

842
00:59:00,789 --> 00:59:03,458
I'm sorry I terrorized you, children.

843
00:59:04,209 --> 00:59:05,377
What?

844
00:59:06,128 --> 00:59:09,506
<i>I decided to let Rowley
take one for the team.</i>

845
00:59:12,718 --> 00:59:16,888
<i>But I'm not entirely sure
that was the right call.</i>

846
00:59:25,439 --> 00:59:26,898
Hey, how's it going?

847
00:59:26,982 --> 00:59:31,027
Well, I was pretty upset
about being suspended from Safety Patrol,

848
00:59:31,111 --> 00:59:35,157
but then I just started drawing a bunch
of Zoo-wee Mamas and I felt better.

849
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:38,201
Look. I put you in this week's cartoon.

850
00:59:38,326 --> 00:59:41,163
And you even get to say,
"Zoo-wee Mama."

851
00:59:41,747 --> 00:59:44,291
Wow. That's really

852
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:48,378
nice.

853
00:59:49,671 --> 00:59:51,548
So, listen.

854
00:59:51,631 --> 00:59:55,135
It's kind of funny, you know,
the whole Safety Patrol thing.

855
00:59:55,218 --> 00:59:56,344
Yeah?

856
00:59:57,012 --> 00:59:58,805
Ready for the funny part?

857
00:59:58,889 --> 01:00:02,309
Well, I'm the one
who terrorized those kids!

858
01:00:05,145 --> 01:00:06,897
- What?
- Yeah,

859
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:09,816
and I think we can both learn
some valuable lessons from this.

860
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:14,279
Like, I should be more careful what I do
in front of Mrs. lr\/ine's house.

861
01:00:14,362 --> 01:00:16,406
And you, well,

862
01:00:17,532 --> 01:00:19,868
you should be more careful
who you lend your coat to.

863
01:00:23,371 --> 01:00:26,875
You know what, Greg?
You're not a good friend.

864
01:00:27,542 --> 01:00:31,546
Whoa. How could you even say that?
I'm a great friend.

865
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:34,800
If you were a great friend,
you would have told Mr. Winsky the truth.

866
01:00:34,883 --> 01:00:37,594
Okay, one thing.
You can't get mad aboutjust...

867
01:00:37,677 --> 01:00:40,263
You only care about yourself.

868
01:00:40,597 --> 01:00:42,516
You hated my cartoon.

869
01:00:43,558 --> 01:00:47,270
You made fun of my clothes.
You disrespected Joshie.

870
01:00:47,521 --> 01:00:50,941
You broke my hand
and you didn't even seem sorry.

871
01:00:51,024 --> 01:00:53,735
That broken hand was the best thing
that ever happened to you!

872
01:00:55,487 --> 01:00:57,113
Don't call me.

873
01:00:57,823 --> 01:01:01,159
Don't come by my house. We're done.

874
01:01:19,261 --> 01:01:21,346
<i>I thought the whole thing would blow over.</i>

875
01:01:21,429 --> 01:01:24,432
<i>But Rowley was still giving me
the silent treatment.</i>

876
01:01:24,516 --> 01:01:27,727
<i>- Even when I tried to make the first move.
- Yeah.</i>

877
01:01:32,148 --> 01:01:35,861
So, anyway, I was so angry at him...

878
01:01:37,112 --> 01:01:41,408
One of the kindergarteners
finally told their parents the whole story.

879
01:01:42,492 --> 01:01:46,997
Greg? You're relieved of your Safety Patrol
duties, effective immediately.

880
01:01:48,206 --> 01:01:49,583
Rowley,

881
01:01:50,792 --> 01:01:54,754
for showing dignity under false suspicion,
I am promoting you

882
01:01:55,630 --> 01:01:56,756
to team captain.

883
01:01:58,925 --> 01:02:03,430
Now, that's a position that I held
for two years. I know you'll honor it.

884
01:02:39,466 --> 01:02:42,719
Hey, Rowley, my mom says it's okay
for me to sleep over tonight.

885
01:02:42,802 --> 01:02:44,137
Awesome!

886
01:02:45,347 --> 01:02:49,309
<i>The whole thing with Rowley is,
I was willing to let bygones be bygones.</i>

887
01:02:49,392 --> 01:02:51,937
<i>But then he made friends with Collin
just to mess with me.</i>

888
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:53,563
<i>As if I even care if</i> he...

889
01:02:56,691 --> 01:02:58,693
<i>Well, you know what?</i>

890
01:02:59,027 --> 01:03:00,737
<i>Two can play at that game.</i>

891
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:05,450
There's no going back, Sergeant.
I need to board the helicopter.

892
01:03:05,533 --> 01:03:07,410
Do you have my back?

893
01:03:07,494 --> 01:03:10,205
I will always have your back, Captain.

894
01:03:30,809 --> 01:03:33,269
- Hey.
- Hey, Greg Heffley.

895
01:03:35,981 --> 01:03:40,235
So, I was thinking maybe you might
want to have a sleepover?

896
01:03:41,403 --> 01:03:43,446
Yeah. With who?

897
01:03:44,572 --> 01:03:45,740
Me.

898
01:03:46,074 --> 01:03:49,744
- Yeah, when?
- Now.

899
01:03:50,954 --> 01:03:52,998
Greg Heffley, I love you!

900
01:03:53,081 --> 01:03:55,208
We are going to be best friends forever!

901
01:03:56,751 --> 01:03:59,129
Wanna have a tickle fight?

902
01:04:03,258 --> 01:04:05,802
Okay. Let's get inside.

903
01:04:08,471 --> 01:04:10,223
I can't believe it!

904
01:04:10,515 --> 01:04:14,602
Greg Heffley's in my room!
Greg Heffley's in my room, Rebecca.

905
01:04:14,894 --> 01:04:17,814
What do you want to do, Greg Heffley?
How about Twister?

906
01:04:17,897 --> 01:04:20,775
I'm not really that much of a Twister guy.

907
01:04:21,735 --> 01:04:22,986
- Candy!
- Wait!

908
01:04:23,069 --> 01:04:25,447
No, no, no! Fregley, come on! Really!

909
01:04:25,613 --> 01:04:27,449
I really think
we should save those for later!

910
01:04:27,532 --> 01:04:30,660
- Maybe we should go outside and...
- My mom doesn't let me have sugar.

911
01:04:30,744 --> 01:04:34,372
She says high glucose in my diet
induces hyperactivity.

912
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:37,625
But it's so good!

913
01:04:38,126 --> 01:04:39,753
Greg Heffley, you want to jumpety-jump?

914
01:04:39,836 --> 01:04:41,546
Yeah, you know what, Fregley?
I just remembered,

915
01:04:41,629 --> 01:04:44,132
I have an appointment,
a really important appointment.

916
01:04:44,215 --> 01:04:48,178
It's a homework appointment.
Yeah, and I really should be going.

917
01:04:51,389 --> 01:04:52,849
Get away from me!

918
01:04:55,518 --> 01:04:58,229
I can fly! Whoa.

919
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,482
How fun, Greg Hefﬂey!

920
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:05,403
Greg? Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg?
Greg? Greg?

921
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:09,657
I hear you breathing, Greg Heffley.

922
01:05:36,309 --> 01:05:37,852
<i>Dear Gregory,</i>

923
01:05:38,061 --> 01:05:41,564
<i>I'm very sorry I chased you
with a booger on my finger.</i>

924
01:05:42,023 --> 01:05:45,360
<i>Here, I put it on this paper
so you can get me back.</i>

925
01:05:59,082 --> 01:06:00,250
What?

926
01:06:04,712 --> 01:06:06,089
All right.

927
01:06:07,215 --> 01:06:11,803
<i>Okay, enough.
I'll show Rowley I don't need him.</i>

928
01:06:11,886 --> 01:06:14,514
<i>When he sees me in the yearbook
as Most Talented,</i>

929
01:06:14,597 --> 01:06:16,349
<i>he's gonna come running back.</i>

930
01:06:18,810 --> 01:06:22,730
Okay, since there are so many of you
here auditioning,

931
01:06:22,814 --> 01:06:27,610
to save time, we're gonna do a group sing
of one of my favorite songs.

932
01:06:27,694 --> 01:06:30,488
Please refer to the lyrics on this handout.

933
01:06:30,572 --> 01:06:34,200
I will pick out the best voices
and place you accordingly.

934
01:07:36,679 --> 01:07:41,893
Greg Heffley, what a lovely
soprano voice you have. I'm stunned!

935
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:44,729
Maybe you should be Dorothy!

936
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:50,693
- No, no, I can't be...
- No!

937
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:54,364
Greg Heffley was suspended
from the school Safety Patrol!

938
01:07:54,447 --> 01:07:58,034
How can you trust him with the lead role
in the play?

939
01:07:58,159 --> 01:08:00,328
He can't be Dorothy! I'm Dorothy!

940
01:08:00,411 --> 01:08:03,665
- All right, Patty, calm down.
- I'm Dorothy! I am!

941
01:08:03,915 --> 01:08:07,252
My mother is the president of the P.T.A.

942
01:08:07,335 --> 01:08:09,504
She can ruin your life!

943
01:08:10,255 --> 01:08:11,839
Justanidea.

944
01:08:13,007 --> 01:08:17,428
All right, well, Greg, your voice is too
high for any of the other male roles.

945
01:08:17,512 --> 01:08:19,555
Perhaps you can be a tree!

946
01:08:19,847 --> 01:08:22,934
A tree? No way.

947
01:08:29,691 --> 01:08:32,860
The trees get to throw apples
at Patty Farrell.

948
01:08:33,695 --> 01:08:35,780
Haven't you seen the movie?

949
01:08:45,790 --> 01:08:48,084
Wait, we don't get arm holes?

950
01:08:48,167 --> 01:08:50,545
How are we gonna throw apples
at Dorothy without arm holes?

951
01:08:50,628 --> 01:08:53,840
You don't need arm holes
because nobody's throwing any apples.

952
01:08:53,923 --> 01:08:57,677
We're not doing the movie.
In my version, the trees sing.

953
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:59,470
These, my dear.

954
01:08:59,554 --> 01:09:03,641
<i>Down the winding yellow road.</i>

955
01:09:03,725 --> 01:09:07,729
<i>Doth she know to where it goes.</i>

956
01:09:07,854 --> 01:09:11,399
<i>With her dog so small and true.</i>

957
01:09:11,482 --> 01:09:14,027
<i>We hope she fares well.</i>

958
01:09:14,110 --> 01:09:18,281
<i>Yes, we do.</i>

959
01:09:23,953 --> 01:09:27,081
My tooth! I think I knocked out my tooth!

960
01:09:27,165 --> 01:09:29,667
Perhaps we should cutout
some arm holes.

961
01:09:29,751 --> 01:09:31,586
- Is he okay?
- You think?

962
01:09:45,099 --> 01:09:48,603
Isn't this exciting? Your son's in a play.

963
01:09:48,686 --> 01:09:52,315
Yeah, sure. It's not wrestling, but...

964
01:09:55,234 --> 01:09:57,028
- But at least it's something.
- Come on, Toto.

965
01:09:57,111 --> 01:10:00,990
Let us explore this magical path!

966
01:10:08,331 --> 01:10:09,749
Bubby!

967
01:10:10,792 --> 01:10:13,211
Bubby! Bubby!

968
01:10:13,294 --> 01:10:14,879
Bubby.

969
01:10:17,632 --> 01:10:20,885
Hey, Bubby, I think you dropped an apple.

970
01:10:25,473 --> 01:10:29,102
<i>We three trees from yonder glen.</i>

971
01:10:29,185 --> 01:10:33,773
<i>Do spy a fair and sweet maiden.</i>

972
01:10:33,856 --> 01:10:37,402
<i>Whilst we 're rooted to our spots.</i>

973
01:10:37,485 --> 01:10:42,073
<i>In silver slippers she doth trot.</i>

974
01:10:42,198 --> 01:10:45,785
<i>Down the winding yellow road.</i>

975
01:10:45,868 --> 01:10:46,869
Oh, yes.

976
01:10:46,953 --> 01:10:50,248
<i>Doth she know to where it goes.</i>

977
01:10:50,331 --> 01:10:51,416
You're dead.

978
01:10:51,499 --> 01:10:54,127
<i>With her dog so small and true.</i>

979
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:56,504
<i>We hope she fares well.</i>

980
01:10:56,587 --> 01:11:00,675
<i>Yes, we do.</i>

981
01:11:00,758 --> 01:11:03,386
<i>We three trees from...</i>

982
01:11:08,975 --> 01:11:10,685
From yonder glen!

983
01:11:10,768 --> 01:11:14,188
Wish her joy through journey's end!

984
01:11:17,483 --> 01:11:18,860
Sing!

985
01:11:20,361 --> 01:11:21,696
Sing!

986
01:11:23,197 --> 01:11:25,616
- Sing!
- This bites!

987
01:11:26,284 --> 01:11:27,785
Come on, Greg Hefﬂey!

988
01:11:27,869 --> 01:11:31,330
Stop ruining the play
like you ruin everything else!

989
01:11:32,331 --> 01:11:36,169
Don't make me come over there
and beat you up again!

990
01:11:49,724 --> 01:11:51,058
Eat this!

991
01:11:51,767 --> 01:11:53,478
Eat this!

992
01:12:13,873 --> 01:12:15,666
What'd you think?
I thought he was the best one up there.

993
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:18,586
- Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.
- You know, I'm...

994
01:12:25,426 --> 01:12:27,637
I thought Dorothy deserved it.

995
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:31,224
Thanks, Dad.

996
01:12:32,266 --> 01:12:34,644
You got some good shots in there.

997
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,653
Look what I found in the trash.

998
01:12:43,736 --> 01:12:45,404
Guess you threw it away by accident.

999
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:47,198
Give it back, Rodrick!

1000
01:12:47,281 --> 01:12:49,200
No way! You want it?

1001
01:12:49,283 --> 01:12:51,160
Come and get it then! Come on.

1002
01:12:51,244 --> 01:12:52,912
- Give it!
- Come on!

1003
01:12:52,995 --> 01:12:55,248
Use your muscular legs!
No, you can't have it.

1004
01:12:55,331 --> 01:12:56,832
- Okay, okay, boys!
- Give it back!

1005
01:12:56,916 --> 01:12:58,167
- Hold on, don't you want it?
- Okay!

1006
01:12:58,251 --> 01:12:59,669
It's for you.

1007
01:13:01,587 --> 01:13:05,174
It's an invitation for
the Mother and Son Sweetheart Dance.

1008
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,802
I knew you didn't want to miss that.

1009
01:13:07,885 --> 01:13:09,470
It looks like a lot of fun.

1010
01:13:09,554 --> 01:13:12,515
I think you should go.
I think it'd be a lot of fun.

1011
01:13:12,598 --> 01:13:15,810
<i>Fun? That's the exact opposite of fun!</i>

1012
01:13:16,978 --> 01:13:20,731
<i>This entire year has been terrible
and nobody even cares!</i>

1013
01:13:20,815 --> 01:13:23,192
<i>My family, my best friend.</i>

1014
01:13:23,818 --> 01:13:27,071
<i>Well, I'm sick of it.
Somebody needs to pay.</i>

1015
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:36,497
Okay, Manny, I'm putting
this Tootsie Roll in Rodrick's backpack.

1016
01:13:37,039 --> 01:13:41,711
It's for Rodrick, so whatever you do,
don't touch the Tootsie Roll.

1017
01:13:47,133 --> 01:13:50,219
Greg? Coaster. Where's he...

1018
01:13:52,388 --> 01:13:55,516
Manny? Where did you get that?

1019
01:14:02,690 --> 01:14:05,192
Oh, my. That's offensive.

1020
01:14:13,701 --> 01:14:15,995
Rodrick? Rodrick!

1021
01:14:17,371 --> 01:14:19,957
I need to talk to you inside! Now!

1022
01:14:20,583 --> 01:14:24,128
Go ahead and talk.
We're a band and we have no secrets.

1023
01:14:24,211 --> 01:14:26,964
Okay, fine. What is this?

1024
01:14:29,592 --> 01:14:32,136
- It's not mine.
- It was in your backpack.

1025
01:14:32,261 --> 01:14:34,388
No, it was in my room.

1026
01:14:37,058 --> 01:14:40,311
Does owning this magazine
make you a better person?

1027
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44,273
- No.
- Did it make you more popular at school?

1028
01:14:44,357 --> 01:14:45,608
Yes!

1029
01:14:46,359 --> 01:14:47,652
No.

1030
01:14:47,735 --> 01:14:52,531
How do you feel about having
owned this type of magazine?

1031
01:14:54,116 --> 01:14:55,993
- Ashamed!
- Nice.

1032
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:03,000
Do you have anything
you wanna say to women

1033
01:15:03,084 --> 01:15:07,004
for having owned this offensive magazine?

1034
01:15:08,589 --> 01:15:09,924
I'm sorry, women.

1035
01:15:10,091 --> 01:15:12,760
- Yeah, women.
- Yeah.

1036
01:15:15,429 --> 01:15:18,599
You're grounded for two weeks.

1037
01:15:18,933 --> 01:15:22,019
Okay, settle down, Susan!
I think one week is plenty!

1038
01:15:22,103 --> 01:15:25,856
Make it four weeks
and I'm gonna need the keys to your van!

1039
01:15:26,315 --> 01:15:27,483
My Van?

1040
01:15:28,609 --> 01:15:31,153
Yeah! Yeah.

1041
01:15:32,988 --> 01:15:34,156
Yeah.

1042
01:15:36,325 --> 01:15:37,618
<i>Hello?</i>

1043
01:15:39,036 --> 01:15:40,287
<i>Hello?</i>

1044
01:15:53,634 --> 01:15:55,428
All right, smile.

1045
01:15:55,761 --> 01:15:58,723
Look at this place! Wanna dance?

1046
01:15:59,390 --> 01:16:01,934
Mom, stop dancing.
You're embarrassing me.

1047
01:16:02,017 --> 01:16:05,187
Come on.
I'm just keeping time to the music.

1048
01:16:05,271 --> 01:16:07,815
I'm begging you, please stop it.

1049
01:16:07,898 --> 01:16:09,817
Okay, okay, 0k8Y...

1050
01:16:11,944 --> 01:16:13,154
Thanks, honey.

1051
01:16:14,321 --> 01:16:15,573
Hi!

1052
01:16:15,656 --> 01:16:20,244
Well, if we're not here to dance,
maybe you should go talk to Rowley.

1053
01:16:21,036 --> 01:16:23,581
I think it's time you two made up.

1054
01:16:23,998 --> 01:16:25,291
I can't.

1055
01:16:26,041 --> 01:16:30,254
Sweetheart, he's your best friend.

1056
01:16:31,005 --> 01:16:34,508
And sometimes,
when somebody's worth it,

1057
01:16:34,592 --> 01:16:37,011
you just have to put yourself out there.

1058
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:41,807
I wouldn't know what to say.

1059
01:16:42,183 --> 01:16:45,436
Well, I could go for an ice cream
after the dance.

1060
01:16:45,519 --> 01:16:48,105
Maybe you could invite him to join us.

1061
01:16:48,272 --> 01:16:49,356
Yeah.

1062
01:16:55,654 --> 01:16:57,072
Hey, Rowley.

1063
01:16:59,033 --> 01:17:00,159
Hey.

1064
01:17:00,493 --> 01:17:04,163
So you want to go
get some ice cream after?

1065
01:17:04,497 --> 01:17:07,416
I'm sorry. We already have plans.

1066
01:17:09,001 --> 01:17:11,587
Yeah. We do.

1067
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:18,260
Fine. My mom wanted me to ask. So I did.

1068
01:17:18,469 --> 01:17:20,554
I didn't even want to go.

1069
01:17:29,563 --> 01:17:30,731
Well?

1070
01:17:34,568 --> 01:17:36,570
Honey, I'm sorry.

1071
01:17:41,242 --> 01:17:42,451
Yeah!

1072
01:18:43,012 --> 01:18:45,306
<i>You have got to be kidding me.</i>

1073
01:18:58,652 --> 01:19:00,863
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

1074
01:19:10,497 --> 01:19:11,582
Hey.

1075
01:19:13,125 --> 01:19:14,251
Hey.

1076
01:19:15,044 --> 01:19:20,007
So, I left my racing game at your house
and Collin's sleeping over tonight.

1077
01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:21,717
So I need it back.

1078
01:19:22,509 --> 01:19:24,803
What? No way.

1079
01:19:24,887 --> 01:19:26,430
Finders, keepers.

1080
01:19:26,555 --> 01:19:28,807
You didn't find it, I left it.

1081
01:19:29,808 --> 01:19:32,937
Fine, then leavers, losers.

1082
01:19:34,063 --> 01:19:36,148
That's not even a real thing.

1083
01:19:36,231 --> 01:19:37,691
It is if I say it is.

1084
01:19:37,775 --> 01:19:39,318
It's my game.

1085
01:19:39,401 --> 01:19:40,569
Do you know what?

1086
01:19:40,653 --> 01:19:43,656
You wouldn't even have that game
if I hadn't told you about it.

1087
01:19:43,739 --> 01:19:45,616
You wouldn't have half the stuff
you have without me.

1088
01:19:45,699 --> 01:19:48,118
Yeah, like a broken hand!

1089
01:19:49,745 --> 01:19:51,580
That was a million years ago.

1090
01:19:51,664 --> 01:19:53,332
It clicks now!

1091
01:19:53,916 --> 01:19:56,585
Hear that? Click, click, click, click.

1092
01:19:56,710 --> 01:19:58,504
And it's all your fault!

1093
01:19:58,587 --> 01:19:59,880
It was an accident!

1094
01:19:59,964 --> 01:20:02,800
Kick his butt, Rowleyl It's easy.

1095
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:05,177
Guys, Greg and Rowley are gonna fight.

1096
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:17,356
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

1097
01:20:27,741 --> 01:20:31,370
Come on, what's wrong with you guys?
Start punching!

1098
01:20:33,747 --> 01:20:35,874
- You start.
- You start it.

1099
01:20:35,958 --> 01:20:37,376
No, you!

1100
01:20:38,919 --> 01:20:40,462
Quit copying me!

1101
01:20:41,171 --> 01:20:44,633
This has got to be the worst fight ever!
Do something!

1102
01:20:55,811 --> 01:21:00,315
Well, well, well. Look who we have here.

1103
01:21:00,941 --> 01:21:03,110
You're so freaking dead.

1104
01:21:03,193 --> 01:21:06,947
All you guys better scram
or I'm gonna kick your butts, too!

1105
01:21:07,906 --> 01:21:09,533
Not you two.

1106
01:21:12,786 --> 01:21:17,499
You guys have no idea
what I'm gonna do to you.

1107
01:21:20,627 --> 01:21:22,421
What are we gonna do?

1108
01:21:23,464 --> 01:21:25,215
- I don't know.
- We need to move this along.

1109
01:21:25,299 --> 01:21:28,093
My shift at Cinnabon
starts in half an hour.

1110
01:21:44,443 --> 01:21:47,821
I know what we're gonna do.
Give me the wide one.

1111
01:21:47,905 --> 01:21:49,990
That's you, let's go.

1112
01:21:51,867 --> 01:21:53,410
Pick it up.

1113
01:21:53,494 --> 01:21:55,329
- But“
- Pick it up.

1114
01:22:10,052 --> 01:22:12,012
Now eat it.

1115
01:22:12,763 --> 01:22:13,764
No!

1116
01:22:13,847 --> 01:22:17,184
Eat it or I'll shove the entire thing
down your throat.

1117
01:22:30,364 --> 01:22:32,783
<i>I don't even want to say
exactly what happened</i>

1118
01:22:32,866 --> 01:22:36,370
<i>because if Rowley ever tries
to run for President</i>

1119
01:22:36,453 --> 01:22:39,456
<i>and someone finds out
what these guys made him do,</i>

1120
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:41,458
<i>he won't have a chance.</i>

1121
01:22:41,542 --> 01:22:42,876
Now you.

1122
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,962
But I'm allergic to dairy!

1123
01:22:45,045 --> 01:22:47,673
I'll die, and then you'll go to jail!
And...

1124
01:22:47,756 --> 01:22:48,882
Hey!

1125
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:51,510
- What are you doing on school property?
- Go, go, go!

1126
01:22:51,677 --> 01:22:52,803
Shotgun!

1127
01:22:52,886 --> 01:22:55,055
Pete Hosey, is that you?

1128
01:22:59,893 --> 01:23:04,022
You boys okay? Yeah? All right.

1129
01:23:08,068 --> 01:23:11,238
Out of my way! Out of my way!

1130
01:23:20,789 --> 01:23:25,627
Oh, my God. Rowley Jefferson ate...

1131
01:23:25,711 --> 01:23:27,462
I ate the cheese!

1132
01:23:44,771 --> 01:23:47,107
Yeah. I ate it.

1133
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:52,571
And you know what, people?
I just did you all a huge favor.

1134
01:23:54,907 --> 01:23:58,827
I ate the cheese to show you all
how stupid this whole school is.

1135
01:24:00,495 --> 01:24:01,955
The wrong friends.

1136
01:24:03,373 --> 01:24:05,250
The wrong lunch table.

1137
01:24:06,168 --> 01:24:07,794
The wrong butt?

1138
01:24:09,254 --> 01:24:11,381
It's all meaningless.

1139
01:24:11,965 --> 01:24:14,176
Just like this cheese.

1140
01:24:15,802 --> 01:24:18,180
I know it. You all know it.

1141
01:24:18,555 --> 01:24:20,098
So come on.

1142
01:24:20,682 --> 01:24:24,519
Everyone else who's sick of it,
step forward and join me!

1143
01:24:27,481 --> 01:24:30,692
Cheese Touch!
Greg Heffley has the Cheese Touch!

1144
01:24:30,776 --> 01:24:33,570
- Run!
- He's got the Cheese Touch!

1145
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:46,833
Not bad, Heffley. Not bad at all.

1146
01:24:59,346 --> 01:25:04,851
So you want to come over
after school and play?

1147
01:25:08,939 --> 01:25:10,148
Yeah.

1148
01:25:13,819 --> 01:25:15,028
Okay.

1149
01:25:30,419 --> 01:25:34,798
Here's your yearbook.
Have a great summer.

1150
01:25:34,881 --> 01:25:36,008
Thanks!

1151
01:25:36,466 --> 01:25:38,260
Here's your yearbook.
Have a great summer.

1152
01:25:38,343 --> 01:25:39,761
Thanks, Patty.

1153
01:25:39,845 --> 01:25:43,473
Here's your yearbook.
You're not in it that much.

1154
01:25:43,557 --> 01:25:46,226
Maybe try to get out there
a little next year.

1155
01:25:46,310 --> 01:25:48,270
You know what, Patty?

1156
01:25:48,353 --> 01:25:51,523
One day middle school will end
and become high school.

1157
01:25:51,606 --> 01:25:54,151
And after that, it just becomes life.

1158
01:25:54,234 --> 01:25:59,156
And all those things you think
are important now won't be any more.

1159
01:26:00,449 --> 01:26:01,908
You wish.

1160
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:05,245
AS if!

1161
01:26:07,622 --> 01:26:09,916
Handing it to you is like touching you

1162
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,754
and I am way too smart
to touch somebody who ate the cheese.

1163
01:26:14,379 --> 01:26:18,008
Rowleyl Have a great summer!

1164
01:26:18,425 --> 01:26:19,760
Stay cool.

1165
01:26:20,761 --> 01:26:23,930
Yep, you're way too smart for me,
Patty Farrell.

1166
01:26:28,435 --> 01:26:30,687
So the year turned out pretty good.

1167
01:26:30,771 --> 01:26:33,940
My goal was to be a class favorite,
and I made it.

1168
01:26:34,024 --> 01:26:38,278
Even if it wasn't exactly
the way I planned it.

1169
01:26:39,154 --> 01:26:41,531
Zoo-wee Mama!

1170
01:32:29,504 --> 01:32:30,505
