1
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:17,000
We have a place, a compound.

2
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,000
We have a community.

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,916
It's safe here.

4
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,208
How many of you are there?

5
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,625
Are any of them children?

6
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,791
Because the fastest way
to get here is by the river,

7
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:35,625
and I don't think
you could make it with kids.

8
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,708
Listen to me.
I'm only gonna say this once.

9
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,375
We are going on the trip now.
It's going to be rough.

10
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:55,083
It's gonna feel like
it's going on for a long time,

11
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,041
so it's gonna be hard to stay alert.

12
00:00:57,125 --> 00:01:01,083
It's gonna be even harder to be quiet,
but you have to do both.

13
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:05,958
You have to do every single thing I say
or we will not make it.

14
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:07,166
Understand?

15
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:13,625
Under no circumstance are you allowed
to take off your blindfold.

16
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:16,333
If I find that you have, I will hurt you.

17
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:17,958
Do you understand?

18
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:22,166
It's cold. We have blankets.

19
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,708
Boy, you have your dog.
Girl, you have your kitty.

20
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:28,625
This is just a place.
There's nothing more that we need from it.

21
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:30,500
Do you understand?

22
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:35,791
And no talking on the river.

23
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:39,708
You must listen as closely as you can.

24
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:42,541
If you hear something in the woods,
you tell me.

25
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:45,250
If you hear something in the water,
you tell me.

26
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:48,708
But you never, ever
take off your blindfold.

27
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:51,000
If you look, you will die.

28
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:52,541
Do you understand?

29
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:59,583
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

30
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:02,333
- Kitty.
- It's okay. It's okay.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,833
Let's go.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,458
Okay. Okay.

33
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:35,833
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

34
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,708
Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty.
Okay, this way. It's fine.

35
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,250
Thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three.

36
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,708
Where is it? Where is it?

37
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:11,625
- Asshole, I was listening to that.
- Yeah, so were the people down the street.

38
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,541
The store was packed.
This thing seems serious.

39
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,625
Wow, you literally have no food.

40
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,708
- What... What thing?
- Are you serious?

41
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,583
- I'm serious.
- Turn on the news, dumb-dumb.

42
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:21,916
Dumb-dumb.

43
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,791
- What channel, dumb-dumb?
- Any one of them.

44
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,458
Airports and train stations
have shut down.

45
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:31,541
Streets are crowded with people
escaping cities by car and on foot

46
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:35,125
as witnesses report
unexplained mass suicides.

47
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,125
First recorded in Romania,

48
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:40,541
there's now an alarming spread
of incidents into Europe and Siberia.

49
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,750
Estimated death toll
is in the tens of thousands.

50
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:47,625
Don't yet know what is causing
the mass suicides in Europe and Russia.

51
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:51,291
The eyewitness reports tell of people
exhibiting psychotic behavior.

52
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,958
Our sources are telling us

53
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,583
this does not appear to be
pathological or viral.

54
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:58,375
US authorities are advising the public
to remain calm.

55
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,791
There have been
no officially confirmed inst...

56
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,708
Well, it's in Russia, so...

57
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,708
Well, try telling that to the soccer moms
fighting over bottled water.

58
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:10,208
Speaking of which,
I just got off the phone with Mom.

59
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,625
How come I have to update her
about you all the time?

60
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,375
- Why do you have to talk about me?
- I'm not telling her about my life.

61
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:20,041
At three o'clock, I'm gonna go check out
an Arabian stud in Sausalito.

62
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,291
See, now that is a sentence
you don't hear every day.

63
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:26,250
- You wanna come?
- I can't. I've got my OB with Dr. Lapham.

64
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,791
- Lapham, when?
- Oh, my God.

65
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,791
Why does your voice get high
when it gets excited?

66
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,416
- How about I drive you?
- No, I'm fine.

67
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,666
I can go in. We can maybe see the baby.

68
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,333
Or I can cancel the appointment
and we can go and see a horse.

69
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,125
No. Fuck the horse.

70
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,166
Wow. Such venom.

71
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,500
What do you think?

72
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:49,208
I think I see
a whole bunch of people sitting together,

73
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,125
but they all feel incredibly lonely.

74
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,833
The loneliness is just incidental.

75
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,958
It's really about
people's inability to connect.

76
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,583
Inability to connect to what?

77
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:01,875
- Can you move?
- Malorie.

78
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,625
- I need you to move.
- We've been through this.

79
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,916
That's not how it's gonna be for you.

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,708
It's different with a baby.
It's an immediate love affair.

81
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,708
- It's not gonna be that way for me.
- Yes, it will.

82
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,958
- No, ma'am.
- You should be afraid of being alone,

83
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,208
not of this.

84
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:20,000
And what we need to do is get you...

85
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,500
out into the real world
with other people,

86
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,500
not stuck in this house all day.
You never leave.

87
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,875
Why should I leave?
I have you to get me groceries.

88
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,291
- You have to move.
- No, not moving.

89
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,541
- Yes, you do.
- Not moving.

90
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,250
- Why?
- Not moving. I love my house!

91
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,791
I know it took you a long time
to find a studio you loved,

92
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,291
and ever since Ryan left,
you've gotten a lot more work done.

93
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,875
But, so fine, so no more roommates.

94
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,041
Ryan was not a roommate.

95
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,833
It turns out he kind of was.

96
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:48,541
Anyway, can't raise a kid here.
Where would you even put her?

97
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,125
How do you know it's a she?

98
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,916
Wishful thinking, I guess.

99
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,416
Sorry, it's work.
I'll be there in a second.

100
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:03,833
Hi.

101
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,791
Yeah, they just had
to push the surgery back an hour.

102
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:07,708
Yes?

103
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah.

104
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,750
I'll call right back.

105
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:14,708
What?

106
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,458
You still don't wanna know the gender?

107
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:20,166
And ruin the surprise, Dr. Lapham? No.

108
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,833
How have you been feeling?
Have you been sleeping any better?

109
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:25,833
Rough.

110
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,666
I never slept well
before I had this condition.

111
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,125
It's called pregnancy.
It's okay to say it out loud.

112
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,791
Oh, don't you know, Doctor,
if you don't acknowledge a thing,

113
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:34,833
it simply goes away?

114
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,166
Oh, really? All this time, I had no idea.

115
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,041
- When a horse gets pregnant...
- God, the horse.

116
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,958
You know about horses? When a horse
gets pregnant, it knows right away.

117
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:43,916
Does it?

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,208
It changes the way it eats.
It changes its gait.

119
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:49,041
It bites all the other horses
who come too close.

120
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,500
It's too bad we're not horses.

121
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,791
It is too bad. Great to be a horse.
Then we would have, like, a mother

122
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,458
who would have actually raised us

123
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,416
and a father
off on some faraway stud farm.

124
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,916
Hold on.
Our father was off on a faraway stud farm.

125
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,541
- That is correct.
- That is correct.

126
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,750
Poor us.

127
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:09,375
We should go feel sorry for ourselves
with lunch and a bottle of wine.

128
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,583
Oh, finally,
now you're making some sense.

129
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,750
- Good.
- Really, in front of me?

130
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:14,833
We didn't mean it...

131
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,791
No, like a tiny glass of rosé
is not gonna hurt the little bean.

132
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,541
I'm pretty sure I heard the word bottle.

133
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,750
You might want to think of a name
besides little bean

134
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,125
seeing as your child
is now the size of a small melon.

135
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,083
Small melon!

136
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,000
I know it's hard to love someone
you haven't met yet.

137
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,041
Oh, that's beautiful.

138
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:35,458
Thought about stitching that on,
like, a little lavender sachet?

139
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,125
- Could sell them in the gift shop.
- In the gift shop.

140
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,583
You're having a baby, Malorie.

141
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:44,708
Pretty soon you and I, Jessica,
and some hard-ass labor and delivery nurse

142
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,875
will be on the third floor
making the same wise cracks.

143
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,583
Only this time,
you won't be going home by yourself.

144
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,375
I know. I know.

145
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,625
But if that's not what you want,

146
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,500
there are plenty of couples
who are desperate to adopt a child.

147
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,750
There are no judgments here.
You can make whatever choice you want.

148
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:06,666
But what you can't do is ignore it
and hope it just goes away.

149
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,958
You okay in there?

150
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,125
I'm great.

151
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,083
Are you puking?

152
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:27,833
Just go to the car.

153
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,125
Is it chunky?

154
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:33,250
No, it was actually the really smooth kind
that just shoots out real clean.

155
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,125
I'll meet you at the car, okay?

156
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,791
- In the corridor.
- Let's get it clear.

157
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,500
Hey! Hey! Hey, security!

158
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,041
Watch out. Help. I need help!

159
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,500
No, get back!

160
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,333
- Calm down. Please calm down.
- Code gray. Level one.

161
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,250
Calm down. Security!

162
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,750
- You feel better?
- It's happening now.

163
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:21,708
You get any on you?

164
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:24,375
The thing in Russia that's making
everybody crazy, it's here now.

165
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,208
- What?
- Can you just, please...

166
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,958
- Hold on.
- Inside the hospital.

167
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,125
Go, go, go, go!

168
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,666
Go, go, go, go, go!

169
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,333
We're going straight to Santa Rosa.

170
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,958
You can stay at my place
until whatever the fuck this is isn't.

171
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,333
- I don't have any clothes.
- You can wear something of mine.

172
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,333
I'm not much of a chaps-and-boots gal.

173
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,291
You're worried about
what to wear right now?

174
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,583
Well, I find it comforting
to focus on the wrong things.

175
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,083
- Shit.
- What?

176
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,333
There's a car stopped in
the middle of the fucking road.

177
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,291
Stop. Just go round.

178
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,375
Move. Let me go.

179
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,833
If this thing gets any worse,
you'll wanna be off the roads

180
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,125
and on a damn horse, trust me.

181
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,500
- Oh, my God!
- Shit. Shit, shit, shit!

182
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,708
People have to stop being so stupid.

183
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,375
Oh, my God, Jess. Just go. Go.

184
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,291
I'm not running the light
with a pregnant lady in the car.

185
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,625
Just drive the car!

186
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,750
You gotta let me just drive.
You're freaking me out.

187
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,000
- You know what?
- Just let me do it.

188
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:37,250
- This isn't me.
- My phone is in the back seat.

189
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:40,125
- It's the foreman wondering where I am.
- Right, just hold your horses.

190
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,083
- Yeah...
- What did you do with it?

191
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:45,250
Oh, my God. What the fuck is that?

192
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,583
What the fuck is what?

193
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,583
What the fuck is what?

194
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,708
What the fuck is what?
What are you looking at?

195
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:55,041
What did you see? Talk to me.
What the fuck is what?

196
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,541
What are you doing? Oh, my God, Jess.
Jess, don't do that.

197
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:01,416
Just what are you... What is wrong
with you? No. Stop it! Stop it!

198
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,000
No, no, no!

199
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,083
Stop it! Stop it!

200
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:07,833
Jess, what the fuck is wrong with you?
Jess, please. Stop it, Jess.

201
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,166
God damn it! Stop it! Please stop it!

202
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,500
- Lydia, what are you doing?
- She's pregnant.

203
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,750
Lydia, not now. Let's go in.

204
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,083
She's pregnant.

205
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,208
You can't help!

206
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,333
Hurry, come inside!

207
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,333
Okay.

208
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,666
Sweetheart, get up. Right now.

209
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,291
Mom.

210
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,208
Please don't go.

211
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,000
Please don't go.

212
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,958
Hey. Hey. Hey.

213
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,833
Keep your eyes down.

214
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,250
Open the door.
This woman is pregnant.

215
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,291
- Open the door!
- No.

216
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:37,208
- Hey! Open the door. Police.
- Don't open it.

217
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:40,541
- Police! Open the fucking door!
- I'm sorry. It's my house.

218
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,583
Get in. Hurry!

219
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,666
Come on. You good?

220
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,750
Are you okay?

221
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,416
She went to help you.

222
00:14:58,666 --> 00:14:59,833
Now she's gone.

223
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:04,375
Come on. Now everybody's
obviously just a little freaked out.

224
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,083
- I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Come in. Come inside the house.

225
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,833
Come on. Come on.

226
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,625
Is everybody all right?

227
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,541
Is anyone getting service in here?
You don't have any Wi-Fi?

228
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,791
I have not gotten any.

229
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,250
Come on.

230
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,583
- It's not working.
- I gotta get a hold of my kids.

231
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,250
No, nothing.

232
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,541
- Honey?
- Nothing. I have nothing.

233
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,125
- They're at home?
- Excuse me.

234
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,958
Mom? Mom, call me. Call me right now.

235
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,875
Something... Hello? Hello?

236
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,208
That thing fucks with your nervous system.
I've seen it in my clients for weeks.

237
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,333
Hey, did I mention I'm a fucking cop?

238
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,958
You're in the Academy.
Doesn't make you a cop.

239
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:55,666
Whatever it is,
I'm sure they'll send someone soon.

240
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,666
No, the only thing that will happen soon
is we're all gonna die soon.

241
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,750
This has a classic bio-warfare signature.

242
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,583
North Korea or Iran.

243
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,541
Douglas, that's it.
They don't know what it is yet, okay?

244
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,666
We just all gotta try to stay calm.

245
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,041
- Really?
- Yeah.

246
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:13,666
Please.

247
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,166
We are so fucking fucked.

248
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,250
I think I heard one.

249
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:24,291
We were running up the street,
and I swear to God, I felt something.

250
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,583
- I heard something.
- Did you see it? What was it?

251
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:29,458
I don't know. It was just there.

252
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,208
- The presence?
- Yeah.

253
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,000
So fucking fucked.

254
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,666
Gotta be an image out there.
They must have released some video.

255
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,416
- I haven't seen anything.
- My crew saw one.

256
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,375
- What?
- What?

257
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:49,000
One minute,
we were digging a foundation...

258
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,541
and then my contractor just lies down
in front of the bulldozer.

259
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:56,500
And then my operator tips the rig
into the ditch and snaps his own neck.

260
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,750
It seems like if you look at it,

261
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:03,458
it makes you crazy
or it makes you wanna hurt yourself.

262
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,083
No, it makes you kill yourself.

263
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,666
And you just...
you just look at it.

264
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,541
- And you commit suicide.
- How can that be?

265
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,375
Close the windows. Get the windows!
Close all the windows.

266
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:21,291
Everybody, get the windows.

267
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,291
Oh, thank you, Jesus.

268
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,833
Andy, Bailey, can you hear me?

269
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,708
Dad? What's that thing outside?

270
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,625
- Bailey! Bailey?
- Bailey.

271
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:39,708
Bailey! Bailey!

272
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,250
- If you go outside, you'll die.
- My children are out there!

273
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,625
- Move!
- You won't make it to your children!

274
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:48,000
- It's back on. Turn it up.
- The President has declared

275
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,375
a state of emergency
and has closed all borders.

276
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,541
Do not, do not go outside.

277
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,666
Avoid social media. Use radi...

278
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,500
What? What in the shit is happening?

279
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,708
- It's an end game, man.
- I'm sorry, what?

280
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,250
The end game. Humanity has been judged,
and we've been found wanting.

281
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,291
- Judged? By who?
- They go by different names.

282
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:14,500
You got world religion and mythology
that's full of mentions of demons

283
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,250
or spirit creatures.
People who've seen these creatures

284
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,875
almost always describe
their encounter as this...

285
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:23,208
as with an entity that takes on
a form of your worst fears or...

286
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,833
your deepest sadness
or your greatest loss.

287
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,833
Sounds like bullshit to me.
Religious talk.

288
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:31,125
It's not bullshit, okay?
It's real talk. It's facts.

289
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,791
They come in all different forms.

290
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:37,833
You got the Aka Manah, the Varios Daevas
from ancient Zoroastrian legend.

291
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:41,083
You've got the Surgat
from ancient Christian occult beliefs

292
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:45,166
that made pregnant women encounter
their unborn children as other creatures

293
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,708
such as lobsters or spiders.

294
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:51,291
You've got the Huli-jing from China.
You've got the Puca from Celtic mythology.

295
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,583
All different names, but the same thing.

296
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,666
And what's that?

297
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:58,750
The end of us.

298
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:02,625
Charlie, did you learn all of that
working at the supermarket?

299
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:06,916
- No, I've been studying it for years.
- In college?

300
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,375
Not college per se, but...

301
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,333
I mean the internet. That's where you get
all your information from.

302
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:15,208
- I'm working on a novel, guys.
- Fuck's sake.

303
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:18,083
So we can't do anything
but wait here until we go crazy like him?

304
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:21,166
The army is bound
to get this under control.

305
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,041
We just have to wait.

306
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:27,250
Hey. Hey.
Why don't we sit back down?

307
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,083
No, no, no. I'm fine.
I'm just trying to make a call.

308
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,666
- Understood.
- I'm okay.

309
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,583
Understood. Understood...

310
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,875
- The phones aren't working right now.
- Okay. Okay.

311
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,333
Listen, are you in any pain?

312
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,083
What? No. No.

313
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:46,000
- I feel like you may have a concussion.
- I am fine. I'm fine.

314
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,250
- Okay. Okay.
- I am fine.

315
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:48,750
Okay.

316
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,250
We were just driving.

317
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:00,875
And then she saw something.

318
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:05,750
I didn't see what it was,
but then she got this look on her face.

319
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,041
It's like she got...

320
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:28,416
She got so sad, and Jess does not get sad.

321
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,041
No.

322
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,250
She stepped out of the car
and ran into the street...

323
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,750
and she's not suicidal.

324
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,166
She would never do that.

325
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,208
But it was...

326
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:44,458
And then that woman,
that woman, she saw me,

327
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:48,166
and then she started talking
to her mom and I...

328
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,750
That woman was my wife.

329
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,166
- Her name was Lydia.
- Okay.

330
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:58,458
And she wasn't talking to her mother.
Her mother's been dead ten years.

331
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:19,791
Hello?

332
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,750
Hello, can anybody hear me? Hello?

333
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,541
Hello? Can anybody hear me? Hello.

334
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,833
Is anybody out there?
Hello, my name is Malorie.

335
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:35,875
I'm on the river. Is anybody out there?

336
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,666
Hello? Hello? Is anybody out there?

337
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,458
Can anybody hear me? Hello?

338
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:54,708
Malorie. Malorie.

339
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:01,541
Malorie.

340
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:14,208
It's been three days
since these events unfolded.

341
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:15,708
Station's lines are down.

342
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:17,916
I can't get in touch with anyone.

343
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,666
We haven't heard anything
from any authorities...

344
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,000
but if you are listening,

345
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:25,000
from what I can gather,
as long as you stay indoors,

346
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:28,250
as long as you don't look
at those things...

347
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:30,500
you should be fine.

348
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:32,333
Do not go outside.

349
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:36,666
The moment I receive any more news,
I will be sure to update you.

350
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,833
My husband works in trusts and estates.
What kind of law do you practice?

351
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:43,791
- Bankruptcy.
- When he's not suing his neighbors.

352
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,083
Hey, how long's
our food gonna last?

353
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:47,583
Not much longer.

354
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:50,875
Because some of us
don't understand the concept of rationing.

355
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:53,208
Douglas, your house is behind this one.

356
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,125
When we finish this,
let's go for a food run.

357
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:57,583
We'd never make it back.
What you don't understand is...

358
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:07,041
- Hey, Tom...
- We can't let anyone in.

359
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:08,958
Okay, just calm down.

360
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:14,000
- Hello?
- Yes, hello.

361
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:15,750
- You're making a big mistake.
- Douglas.

362
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:17,666
- Yes, hello.
- Hello?

363
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:21,500
My name is Olympia.
I need help. Please.

364
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:23,833
- Don't open the goddamn...
- I'm gonna open the door.

365
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:24,791
Fuck!

366
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:26,416
Okay, one second.

367
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:29,083
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey.

368
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:32,208
Move.

369
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:37,125
Go ahead.

370
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:39,625
Go ahead.

371
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:41,916
Go get a...
Go get a blanket. Go get a blanket.

372
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:45,541
There should be two lamps
on either side of the door.

373
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:49,041
I'm gonna hand you a blanket and I want
you to drape it across the both of them.

374
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:50,208
- Okay.
- Okay?

375
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:52,000
I need you to block the view for me.

376
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:53,583
- Cover your eyes.
- So stupid.

377
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:55,750
Malorie, cover your eyes.

378
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:01,791
Here. Here. Okay.

379
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:03,666
Okay.

380
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:06,333
Let me know when you have it.

381
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:11,791
Tom, is this safe?

382
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:13,791
- Shut up.
- Hold on, please!

383
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:16,833
- Okay, it's all covered.
- Okay.

384
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:18,791
I got you. Come on.

385
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:19,875
Hold on. Hold on.

386
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:23,291
We're good.

387
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:26,625
- Malorie.
- Yeah.

388
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:28,250
- The gun, please.
- Yeah.

389
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:31,833
Yeah, before you kill someone with it
since you have no idea how it works.

390
00:25:36,791 --> 00:25:38,333
It's okay.

391
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,583
How...

392
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:46,541
There are so many of you.

393
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:48,208
So are you...

394
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:50,833
Are... Are you pregnant?

395
00:25:51,958 --> 00:25:54,083
Yeah. October 1st.

396
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:56,791
What about you?

397
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,583
End of September.

398
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:04,416
Wait. Hold on. Is shit
still going crazy out there or what?

399
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:06,750
Are you on your own?

400
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:08,333
Yeah, I am.

401
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:11,833
My husband was deployed last month
'cause he's in the Air Force.

402
00:26:11,916 --> 00:26:14,541
I tried to make stuff last
as long as I could...

403
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:18,458
but I was so hungry
and I was afraid I would starve my baby,

404
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:19,875
so I didn't know what to do.

405
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:21,416
- Have some water.
- Thank you.

406
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,000
So you left and started knocking
on random doors?

407
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,708
I only live a block away.

408
00:26:25,791 --> 00:26:29,000
Great, now we can all starve
here in the maternity ward.

409
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:32,500
It just means we need
to get more supplies.

410
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:34,958
Of course, but we can't get anything
if we can't see.

411
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:36,708
Oh, we're so fucking trapped.

412
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:38,291
Maybe not.

413
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,375
Maybe we can see better than we thought.

414
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,416
- What do you mean?
- Come here.

415
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:51,083
We have cameras around the house
transmitting a live feed.

416
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,250
Come upstairs. Come on.

417
00:26:58,333 --> 00:26:59,791
It's a digitized signal.

418
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:03,458
It just shows the color temperatures
of the objects. It's neutered information.

419
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:06,208
- Colors on a flat screen.
- But an image can still have power.

420
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,250
We have no idea
how these things can operate.

421
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:09,875
These images are not direct.

422
00:27:10,916 --> 00:27:13,083
We can't look at whatever it is
with the naked eye,

423
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:15,291
but maybe we can with a translator.

424
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:17,166
Pixels and heat.

425
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,375
Maybe it won't even show up.

426
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:22,458
Well, we're not gonna find out
until one of us takes a look.

427
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:25,208
I think it's a huge mistake.

428
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:28,083
You would, Douglas.
You think everything is a huge mistake.

429
00:27:28,666 --> 00:27:30,625
Sooner or later
we're gonna have to do something.

430
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:32,833
We don't know how long
we're gonna have electricity.

431
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:35,708
You gotta trust me on this.
I really think this is gonna work.

432
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,041
Okay. Okay.

433
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:41,166
Maybe if it does, we could use
the technology for supply runs or...

434
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,166
Exactly.

435
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,833
Just not too tight.

436
00:27:43,916 --> 00:27:45,625
I hope you know what you're doing.

437
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:51,416
Listen... you and your husband,
you're good people.

438
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,875
You know, it wasn't... It wasn't that.

439
00:27:55,791 --> 00:27:57,125
Thank you, Douglas.

440
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:01,291
You don't have to do this.

441
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:03,791
I know. Don't worry.

442
00:28:05,958 --> 00:28:08,583
- Tom, I need the remote.
- Yeah.

443
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:09,833
There you go, bud.

444
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,583
So why are you suing him?

445
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:43,708
'Cause they want to tear down
this part of their house

446
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:46,000
and build some glass monstrosity.

447
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:47,750
His husband's an architect.

448
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:51,333
It's his property.
Why do you care what he builds?

449
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:54,333
Because I have to look at it.

450
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,000
Not a chance.

451
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:30,250
Well, the world's ending, baby,
so you never know.

452
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:40,458
Where are you, motherfucker?

453
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:18,250
Come on, Greg.

454
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:21,333
Focus.

455
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:37,375
It's...
It's about the end of the world.

456
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:39,375
My novel.

457
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:43,583
But it's not one of those kids' stories
where they all got crossbows

458
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:46,958
and they're killing each other to survive
or running around some giant maze.

459
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:49,583
No, this story is...

460
00:30:50,541 --> 00:30:51,750
This story's gonna be real.

461
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:55,041
Did you ever think
it was gonna be anything like this?

462
00:31:23,958 --> 00:31:25,375
Greg! Greg, can we come in?

463
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:26,875
- What's going on?
- Greg!

464
00:31:26,958 --> 00:31:28,625
Greg, can we come in?

465
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:31,416
Look away!

466
00:31:32,416 --> 00:31:34,708
Cover your eyes!
Cover your eyes. Find the monitor.

467
00:31:34,791 --> 00:31:36,291
- Greg.
- Greg.

468
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:37,750
- Come on, Greg.
- Greg?

469
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:41,041
- Shit.
- I've got it here.

470
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:46,541
Okay! Okay! Okay!
You can open your eyes. You can see.

471
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,625
I fucking told him that it was a mistake.

472
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:02,333
Come on.
We got to move. We got to move.

473
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:06,791
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Come on. We gotta go.

474
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,291
We're never getting out of here.

475
00:32:09,916 --> 00:32:11,916
No one's coming for us.

476
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,875
No one's coming for...

477
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:15,916
We need to go.

478
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:51,500
Hi.

479
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:53,000
Hi.

480
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:54,291
Yeah.

481
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:57,333
I thought it might be good for us
to be close considering...

482
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,125
Sure.

483
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:05,208
You know,
this way, we won't be lonely.

484
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:08,125
I read this blog post once
about how pregnant women

485
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:10,000
should always sleep next to someone

486
00:33:10,083 --> 00:33:12,750
because the baby can sense
when the mother is lonely.

487
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:14,458
Perfect.

488
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:19,375
So...
have you thought about names yet?

489
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:22,083
No, not yet.

490
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:24,333
How about you?

491
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:30,041
Well, if it's a girl we wanted
to name her, like, Ariel or Jasmine.

492
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:34,333
I mean, I would love to name her
Cinderella and just call her Ella.

493
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:39,500
And what did your husband like?

494
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:41,291
He loves everything I love.

495
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:46,500
What about you?
Does your husband have a favorite?

496
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:48,541
Oh, it's just me.

497
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:52,125
- Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine. It's fine.

498
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:54,916
Well, what about your family?
They must be excited...

499
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,500
Do you know what?
Could you just excuse me for one second?

500
00:33:58,583 --> 00:33:59,625
I'll be right back.

501
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Sorry.

502
00:34:58,125 --> 00:35:00,458
That's something you can't unsee.

503
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:04,000
Ah, no. No, you cannot.

504
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:06,083
Yeah.

505
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,333
Sorry.

506
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:20,625
Are you okay?

507
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:23,166
Yeah.

508
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:26,375
I'll wait to do my laundry in the morning.

509
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,583
- That's probably a good idea.
- Yeah, I think so.

510
00:35:29,666 --> 00:35:30,791
Good night.

511
00:36:03,875 --> 00:36:05,291
Hello!

512
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:08,250
You guys need some help?

513
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:14,250
- It's okay to take your blindfolds off.
- Do not take your blindfolds off. Do not!

514
00:36:15,458 --> 00:36:18,708
I got some food.
Those kids look hungry.

515
00:36:18,791 --> 00:36:21,208
Get down! Get down! Get down!
Down. Down. Down.

516
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:32,291
Hey, little buddies.

517
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:35,125
Have you ever seen a baby deer?

518
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,708
I'll tell you a secret.

519
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,208
I found one in the woods.

520
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:51,083
Okay. I know you're scared.
Well, listen, there's no need.

521
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:58,291
I'm not here to hurt you.
I can pull you to shore.

522
00:37:08,416 --> 00:37:10,875
Take your goddamn blindfold off!

523
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:26,666
I've seen one. I've seen the truth.

524
00:37:27,791 --> 00:37:29,833
Take your blindfold off.

525
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:35,041
It's beautiful. It's beautiful.
Take your blindfold off.

526
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:41,541
Take your blindfold off!

527
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:57,333
It shall cleanse the world!

528
00:37:57,416 --> 00:37:58,625
Everyone must look.

529
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:01,208
Everyone must look.

530
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:13,000
Got some bad news.

531
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,458
All right. We're running out of food
and there's no help coming.

532
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:19,208
We've got to get outside.

533
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,458
Look, I might know where we can get more.

534
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:27,458
- Where, Charlie?
- The Fields market.

535
00:38:28,708 --> 00:38:31,125
I locked the place up
when everything started going crazy.

536
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:34,666
- You're just telling us this?
- At least we know now. Thank you.

537
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:37,250
Okay, so we'll need a group of us to go.

538
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:39,125
We'll be dead before we get there.

539
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:40,833
- Are you kidding me?
- I'll go.

540
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:43,166
- Well, if he's going, I'm going.
- You're pregnant!

541
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:46,750
Well, if all you guys are going,
then I can come too.

542
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:51,250
Why don't I go on the first run
and then you can go on the second run?

543
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:52,625
- I'll come.
- What?

544
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:54,958
- It's a death wish.
- I have the training. It'll be fine.

545
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,875
I don't like this.
I don't think anyone should go.

546
00:38:57,958 --> 00:39:00,375
- There are four of us.
- Five. Charlie's going.

547
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:02,750
Charlie's going?
Charlie ain't going nowhere.

548
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:05,208
- You know the security system.
- No chance I'm going.

549
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:07,208
I gave you the information.
That's all you needed.

550
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:09,833
You don't need me to tell you
where to go. It is a supermarket.

551
00:39:09,916 --> 00:39:12,000
They got signs.
You've been shopping before.

552
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:14,000
You wanna get cereal,
the sign will say cereals.

553
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:15,958
If you can't read, I get it,
but you can read.

554
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:20,791
- No. You don't need me to go with you...
- Charlie. It'll be research for the book.

555
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:22,833
Okay? Be awesome.

556
00:39:26,791 --> 00:39:29,625
All right, so the idea is if we
can black out all the windows,

557
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,250
it's efficient and it's safe.

558
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:33,875
Is anybody else hearing this?

559
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,083
How is driving blind safer?

560
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:37,083
We're not.

561
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,458
We've got the GPS.

562
00:40:04,041 --> 00:40:06,291
Calculating route.

563
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:31,500
Continue straight.

564
00:40:35,791 --> 00:40:38,625
In half a mile,
turn right onto Bay Street.

565
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,500
- What is that?
- It's a curb.

566
00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:42,791
It's just a curb.

567
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:50,041
It's a proximity sensor.

568
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:05,000
Just a speed bump. It's just a speed bump.

569
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:09,875
Turn right here.

570
00:41:28,791 --> 00:41:30,750
- Are we off the road?
- No, there's something.

571
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:34,208
- I think it must be just a truck.
- Just go around.

572
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,250
- Keep going around it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

573
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:39,958
What was that?

574
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:52,041
Is somebody else driving out there?

575
00:42:03,708 --> 00:42:06,208
- Charlie, breathe.
- Shit! Fuck this shit.

576
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:08,208
- Get the fuck out!
- Charlie! Calm down.

577
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:10,291
Guys, stop touching him.

578
00:42:10,375 --> 00:42:12,916
- Look at me. You have to be quiet.
- Shut him up.

579
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:26,916
Fuck! We're not gonna make it.

580
00:42:28,958 --> 00:42:31,041
Calm down. Calm down.

581
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,333
- Oh, shit!
- Everybody, hold on.

582
00:42:34,416 --> 00:42:36,458
Hold on to something. Gonna move!

583
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:39,958
Hold on!

584
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:41,500
That's not a fucking speed bump!

585
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:43,541
- Fuck, it's stuck.
- Hold on.

586
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:47,333
- Turn left here.
- Slow down! Slow down!

587
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:55,708
You have arrived.

588
00:42:57,833 --> 00:42:59,250
What the fuck?

589
00:42:59,333 --> 00:43:01,791
And after all this,
we're supposed to get out now?

590
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:03,541
Lucky us.

591
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,333
- On three. One, two, three.
- I'm ready now.

592
00:43:13,208 --> 00:43:15,375
What was that?
What did I just hit?

593
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:16,875
That's just a pillar.

594
00:43:19,583 --> 00:43:20,916
Okay. Where's the...

595
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,833
The door should be
just a couple of paces up, man.

596
00:43:23,916 --> 00:43:25,666
- I'm lost.
- Towards your left.

597
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:28,291
Left. Left. I'm lost.

598
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:30,541
- Come on, you guys.
- I'm lost.

599
00:43:30,625 --> 00:43:33,000
- Oh, here. Here.
- Okay. Okay.

600
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:34,250
- You're in?
- No.

601
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:35,708
Okay. Wait. Almost got it.

602
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,166
Okay, I got it.

603
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:40,125
Go on.

604
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:48,541
All right. We're in.

605
00:43:50,666 --> 00:43:52,025
Hello!

606
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:55,500
I'll check the windows.

607
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:57,958
Here we go. Here we go.

608
00:44:08,041 --> 00:44:10,833
All right, I think we're clear.
You can take 'em off.

609
00:44:15,375 --> 00:44:16,875
Oh, my God.

610
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:19,666
- Jack-fucking-pot.
- Yeah.

611
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:22,750
- Where are the canned goods?
- Aisle two.

612
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:24,166
- Toilet paper?
- Five.

613
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:26,666
- Fuck that. Where's the booze?
- It's in seven.

614
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:30,750
Let's not forget. We have limited space.
Stick to non-perishables, the necessities.

615
00:44:30,833 --> 00:44:32,625
- Where are the electronics?
- Go to six.

616
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:34,458
Six. All right. Cool. Thank you.

617
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:36,541
I'm not cleaning this shit up.

618
00:44:39,375 --> 00:44:40,500
Sweet.

619
00:44:47,375 --> 00:44:49,291
Boy, I'm glad I tagged along.

620
00:44:49,875 --> 00:44:53,166
This is truly the happiest place on Earth.

621
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:55,333
I know. You're not kidding!

622
00:45:00,791 --> 00:45:04,958
It's my baby shower gift to you.

623
00:45:06,708 --> 00:45:07,708
Why, thank you.

624
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:09,000
Yeah.

625
00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:12,208
So, my sister is
expecting her fourth, so...

626
00:45:12,708 --> 00:45:15,250
Oh, my God. She's a saint.

627
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:16,541
Yeah, she is.

628
00:45:17,583 --> 00:45:19,708
And I'm always touching her belly.

629
00:45:20,958 --> 00:45:22,000
It's calming.

630
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,750
Yeah, it's nature's dirty little trick.

631
00:45:28,958 --> 00:45:30,458
Is your sister in Sacramento?

632
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,625
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

633
00:45:33,708 --> 00:45:34,666
Yeah.

634
00:45:39,916 --> 00:45:42,750
What about you? Where did you...
Where did you grow up?

635
00:45:42,833 --> 00:45:44,333
Oh, just outside of Stockton.

636
00:45:44,416 --> 00:45:45,916
- Stockton.
- Yeah.

637
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,041
- We raised horses.
- On a real ranch?

638
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:52,500
- Well, my daddy was a real cowboy.
- That's how you learned your...

639
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,041
- What?
- Little shotgun trick.

640
00:45:54,125 --> 00:45:56,375
Yeah. I had an interesting childhood.

641
00:45:58,041 --> 00:46:01,416
Ah, but Stockton wasn't
all that far from Sacramento.

642
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,750
No. Just down 99.

643
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:06,208
- Just down Highway 99.
- Worlds apart, right?

644
00:46:07,666 --> 00:46:10,125
Still we could've met some other way.

645
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:12,333
Sure.

646
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,125
Could have been your babysitter.

647
00:46:17,416 --> 00:46:19,041
My hot babysitter.

648
00:46:22,208 --> 00:46:26,041
You're... You're only saying that
'cause we're all gonna die.

649
00:46:27,791 --> 00:46:28,666
Possibly.

650
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:08,083
How did you guys get so lucky?

651
00:47:12,041 --> 00:47:13,041
Hi.

652
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:16,375
Hi, there.

653
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,458
So sleepy.

654
00:47:23,125 --> 00:47:27,500
Attention, all shoppers,
come to aisle seven, please.

655
00:47:27,583 --> 00:47:31,541
I have a big, big, big, big, big
announcement to make.

656
00:47:31,625 --> 00:47:34,541
- Ladies and gentlemen, please...
- Yes, Douglas.

657
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:40,833
I would like to take this opportunity
to make a toast to all of us...

658
00:47:41,416 --> 00:47:48,250
because all of us, collectively,
are making the end of the world...

659
00:47:51,666 --> 00:47:55,041
great again! Yeah!

660
00:47:59,708 --> 00:48:00,583
Birdies.

661
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,875
I mean, don't you doofuses get it?

662
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:08,958
We could just stay here.

663
00:48:09,041 --> 00:48:14,250
We have a year's supply
of food and drink right here.

664
00:48:14,333 --> 00:48:17,666
We don't ever have to pay
and we shouldn't ever leave.

665
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:19,958
And what are they gonna
do at Greg's? Starve?

666
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,333
Better them than us.

667
00:48:24,416 --> 00:48:27,708
We have everything we need to live here.
Everything.

668
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:34,083
There is no statistical, logical, or legal
argument for trying to get back there.

669
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:37,291
Well, here's an argument.
We're not assholes.

670
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:40,833
And we're not staying.

671
00:48:50,083 --> 00:48:51,000
What is it?

672
00:48:55,958 --> 00:48:59,166
- Somebody let me out of here.
- Charlie, what's behind there?

673
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:00,416
It's a loading dock.

674
00:49:01,041 --> 00:49:02,000
Hello?

675
00:49:02,958 --> 00:49:05,250
Please let me in.

676
00:49:06,416 --> 00:49:07,916
Speak up, I can't hear you.

677
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,875
Please let me in.

678
00:49:11,625 --> 00:49:12,625
Cover your eyes.

679
00:49:12,708 --> 00:49:14,333
- What?
- I'm gonna open the door.

680
00:49:14,416 --> 00:49:16,541
- No.
- There's a person out there.

681
00:49:16,625 --> 00:49:18,250
I have to open the door.

682
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:23,083
Okay.

683
00:49:23,166 --> 00:49:24,291
Okay...

684
00:49:24,958 --> 00:49:25,958
Okay.

685
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:30,875
- Hello?
- Hello.

686
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,791
Please let me in. I'm trapped.

687
00:49:33,875 --> 00:49:36,625
Wait, wait, wait. Is that...
Fish Fingers, is that you?

688
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:39,958
- Charlie, yeah, it's me.
- Who's Fish Fingers, Charlie?

689
00:49:40,041 --> 00:49:43,000
He works here at the supermarket with me.
He works in the seafood department.

690
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:46,458
He's been to prison and he's a bit crazy,
but he's always nice to me.

691
00:49:46,541 --> 00:49:48,833
- How did you get there, man?
- I got... I got...

692
00:49:48,916 --> 00:49:50,583
They tricked me!

693
00:49:50,666 --> 00:49:51,625
Who's they?

694
00:49:51,708 --> 00:49:53,708
Who you talking about?
Are you there alone?

695
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:55,750
They tricked me
and they left me to rot here.

696
00:49:55,833 --> 00:49:57,875
Who left you to rot?
What are you talking about?

697
00:49:57,958 --> 00:50:00,000
You guys,
there's something wrong.

698
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:01,375
There's something wrong!

699
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:04,375
- Please let me in. I'm trapped.
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

700
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:06,750
What are you doin', Fish Fingers?
What are you doing, man?

701
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:10,916
Look at it!
It wants you to see it! Let me in!

702
00:50:14,125 --> 00:50:17,083
He's too strong. I can't hold him.

703
00:50:17,166 --> 00:50:18,500
Let me in!

704
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:19,916
Shit!

705
00:50:21,958 --> 00:50:23,625
Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

706
00:50:23,708 --> 00:50:25,000
Fuck!

707
00:50:25,083 --> 00:50:26,416
Charlie, wait!

708
00:50:29,625 --> 00:50:32,083
Look at it, Charlie. It's beautiful.

709
00:50:32,166 --> 00:50:34,000
- Charlie?
- Charlie!

710
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,791
- Charlie!
- Charlie!

711
00:50:37,875 --> 00:50:39,791
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, fuck.

712
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:44,041
Fuck!

713
00:50:47,166 --> 00:50:48,291
We gotta go.

714
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:51,666
We gotta move. Come on. Let's go.

715
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:52,958
Let's get out of here.

716
00:50:56,958 --> 00:50:59,958
Please. Please let me in.

717
00:51:00,041 --> 00:51:02,041
How is that guy alive in there?

718
00:51:02,625 --> 00:51:04,333
Please let me in.

719
00:51:27,958 --> 00:51:29,583
Hi, Felix!

720
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:33,166
Oh, my God. Look at all this stuff.

721
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:36,083
- Birdies?
- Yeah, they...

722
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:38,666
They seem to sense
when the creatures are around.

723
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:40,625
Where's Charlie?

724
00:51:42,583 --> 00:51:45,291
Another novel I won't have to read.

725
00:51:45,375 --> 00:51:47,791
He saved us, you fucking asshole.

726
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:12,208
I know what you think of me,
what everybody thinks of me.

727
00:52:12,291 --> 00:52:14,208
You know, in the divorce petition...

728
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:20,625
my first wife said that to call me a creep
would be an affront to creeps everywhere.

729
00:52:22,291 --> 00:52:25,291
My second wife said
she no longer feared going to hell,

730
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:28,416
'cause it couldn't possibly be worse
than being married to me.

731
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,583
Think I would have loved them.

732
00:52:30,666 --> 00:52:31,541
Maybe.

733
00:52:32,125 --> 00:52:33,208
And then Lydia.

734
00:52:34,166 --> 00:52:37,083
Third time really was the charm for me.

735
00:52:38,625 --> 00:52:40,875
She was the kindest person I ever met.

736
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:44,375
But I'm here and she's gone.
You know why that is?

737
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:47,041
Because, in the end,
there are only two types of people.

738
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:49,125
The assholes and the dead.

739
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:51,416
God, you sound like my father.

740
00:52:52,083 --> 00:52:53,250
Like your father? Why?

741
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:58,583
Was he a towering intellect given
to dispensing wisdom to undeserving fools?

742
00:52:58,666 --> 00:53:00,500
Yes, he was fluent in asshole as well.

743
00:53:01,541 --> 00:53:06,458
And just like you, he blamed
everything he did on some deeper meaning,

744
00:53:07,041 --> 00:53:09,125
convoluted conspiracy theories and...

745
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:13,041
how it was everybody else's fault
when he was clearly in the wrong.

746
00:53:13,125 --> 00:53:16,458
But, you know, once my sister and I
realized it was just an excuse

747
00:53:16,541 --> 00:53:20,250
to treat his family like shit,
it made life a little easier.

748
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:23,291
You know what though?
I see one difference between us.

749
00:53:25,541 --> 00:53:26,583
I'm never wrong.

750
00:53:27,166 --> 00:53:28,291
You are...

751
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:29,791
You're two pricks in a pod.

752
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,333
Do I look like him as well?

753
00:53:35,166 --> 00:53:36,166
Not really.

754
00:53:37,166 --> 00:53:40,458
- He wasn't exquisitely handsome?
- It's not that, it's just...

755
00:53:42,375 --> 00:53:44,458
the hair... the hair is different.

756
00:53:44,541 --> 00:53:45,916
- The hair?
- Yeah.

757
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:48,041
He had some.

758
00:53:58,375 --> 00:54:00,041
Oh, I can't.

759
00:54:00,125 --> 00:54:02,875
Oh, come on, the world is ending.

760
00:54:02,958 --> 00:54:06,875
I really don't think a quarter-ounce
of whiskey's gonna tip the scales, do you?

761
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:11,291
Well...

762
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:13,833
I hope you're wrong.

763
00:54:14,916 --> 00:54:16,708
About the assholes and the dead.

764
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,375
I hope there is more.

765
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:24,375
Here's to hoping there is more.

766
00:54:47,458 --> 00:54:49,208
- Close the garage.
- I've got it.

767
00:54:50,666 --> 00:54:52,083
Wait. Wait. Wait.

768
00:54:52,166 --> 00:54:53,791
- Cover your eyes.
- Yeah.

769
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:56,541
Okay, okay, okay.
It's closed. It's closed.

770
00:54:58,166 --> 00:54:59,458
Sons of bitches.

771
00:55:00,458 --> 00:55:02,250
Where's the goddamn car?

772
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:04,458
You guys.
You guys, where are Lucy and Felix?

773
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:14,375
Fuck.

774
00:55:43,416 --> 00:55:44,583
You stopped rowing.

775
00:55:45,458 --> 00:55:46,791
I'm just taking a break.

776
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:49,583
How much longer?

777
00:55:49,666 --> 00:55:50,708
A few hours.

778
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:16,875
Malorie!

779
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:20,333
Malorie! Malorie!

780
00:56:20,416 --> 00:56:21,541
Help!

781
00:56:23,041 --> 00:56:23,875
Malorie!

782
00:56:29,625 --> 00:56:31,791
- Are you okay? Are you okay?
- Yes.

783
00:56:31,875 --> 00:56:34,333
- I'm cold.
- I know. I know you're cold. Hold on.

784
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:42,291
No, no, no, no, no, no.
All the food and blankets. God damn it!

785
00:56:43,291 --> 00:56:45,125
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, it's...

786
00:56:45,208 --> 00:56:46,166
Hold on.

787
00:56:46,791 --> 00:56:48,791
Okay. All right.

788
00:56:48,875 --> 00:56:51,333
- Okay.
- I'm so cold.

789
00:56:51,916 --> 00:56:55,083
We're gonna get you warmed up, okay?
We're gonna get you warmed up.

790
00:56:56,833 --> 00:56:59,000
Put this around you.

791
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:01,041
Keep your blindfolds on. Stay tight.

792
00:57:05,083 --> 00:57:06,583
Did you hear that?

793
00:57:06,666 --> 00:57:07,666
Did you hear that?

794
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:21,041
Lay down on the bottom of the boat.
Lay down, really flat.

795
00:57:21,125 --> 00:57:23,541
I need you to be quiet.
I'm gonna leave the birds with you.

796
00:57:23,625 --> 00:57:26,541
I'm gonna cover you up, but do not
make a sound and do not leave this boat.

797
00:57:26,625 --> 00:57:28,083
Understand? Do not leave this boat!

798
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:01,625
Shit.

799
01:00:49,708 --> 01:00:51,416
Malorie.

800
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,250
Malorie.

801
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:57,666
Malorie.

802
01:01:07,041 --> 01:01:09,833
Something is wrong with Malorie.

803
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:12,166
Malorie.

804
01:01:46,791 --> 01:01:47,833
Malorie?

805
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:54,583
Malorie?

806
01:01:58,541 --> 01:02:00,291
Malorie?

807
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:09,916
I told you to stay on the boat.

808
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,041
You don't think.

809
01:02:11,125 --> 01:02:13,500
You do exactly what I say or you die,
do you understand me?

810
01:02:13,583 --> 01:02:16,250
If something happens to me,
do not try and help me.

811
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:18,166
Forget about me and try to save yourself.

812
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:19,625
Do you understand?

813
01:02:19,708 --> 01:02:22,833
Say it! If something happens to me,
what do you do?

814
01:02:22,916 --> 01:02:25,291
You save yourself. Say it!

815
01:02:25,916 --> 01:02:27,916
- I save myself.
- You save yourself.

816
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,083
I can't trust you.

817
01:02:49,583 --> 01:02:52,833
The end of the world makes us do things.

818
01:02:54,166 --> 01:02:56,833
- It's not the end of the world.
- Really?

819
01:02:57,541 --> 01:02:58,791
It sure feels like it.

820
01:03:02,541 --> 01:03:08,250
At the end of my deployment in Iraq,
we were stationed at this village...

821
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:13,500
ordered to patrol the streets,
make sure everybody was safe.

822
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:16,958
One morning, we saw...

823
01:03:18,416 --> 01:03:21,000
this father walking with his four kids.

824
01:03:21,083 --> 01:03:23,458
So I pulled over to make sure
everything was okay

825
01:03:23,541 --> 01:03:26,166
and to make sure he got
wherever he was going safely.

826
01:03:29,166 --> 01:03:31,333
Come to find out,
he was walking his kids to school.

827
01:03:33,583 --> 01:03:36,166
In the middle of all that shit,

828
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:39,250
all that chaos,
he was walking his kids to school.

829
01:03:46,333 --> 01:03:47,208
So...

830
01:03:50,791 --> 01:03:52,208
So we just followed him.

831
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:54,833
Day after day.

832
01:03:55,458 --> 01:03:56,500
We escorted him.

833
01:03:59,958 --> 01:04:01,416
That just became our routine.

834
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,500
And then, at the end of our time,

835
01:04:06,583 --> 01:04:10,250
he gave me this
when it was time to come back home.

836
01:04:23,833 --> 01:04:26,500
I like to think he's still
walking his kids to school.

837
01:05:07,291 --> 01:05:09,458
Hello, can anybody hear me? Hello?

838
01:05:09,541 --> 01:05:12,125
This is Malorie.
Anybody, can you hear me? Hello?

839
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:18,583
Can anybody hear me? Hello?
Hello? Can anybody hear me?

840
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:22,833
Hello? Testing, hello?

841
01:05:25,208 --> 01:05:27,166
Hello, is anyone out there? Hello?

842
01:05:28,041 --> 01:05:30,125
Can you hear me, please?

843
01:05:30,208 --> 01:05:32,208
- Hello? Testing.
- Are you a...

844
01:05:32,291 --> 01:05:33,708
Do you have a blindfold on?

845
01:05:34,375 --> 01:05:37,625
You do.
Is the blanket behind you still up?

846
01:05:39,875 --> 01:05:42,250
Okay, just come in really, really quickly.

847
01:05:42,333 --> 01:05:45,791
Thank you. Here's my blindfold.
Thank you so much.

848
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:49,375
It's okay. Just wait. Wait here. Malorie!

849
01:05:49,458 --> 01:05:51,208
- I gotta pee.
- Olympia, what are you doing?

850
01:05:51,291 --> 01:05:52,541
- Malorie!
- What are you doing?

851
01:05:52,625 --> 01:05:56,416
- What are you thinking? Get down!
- Okay, he's just scared.

852
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,458
- He's just scared.
- Tom. Check the bag.

853
01:05:58,541 --> 01:06:01,041
Get over here, Olympia. Get over here.

854
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:02,750
- Who are you?
- Who is this guy?

855
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:05,083
Tom, I've got him. Check the bag.
Check the bag.

856
01:06:05,666 --> 01:06:07,041
- Who is this?
- He's just scared.

857
01:06:07,125 --> 01:06:08,583
- Who are you?
- How did he get in here?

858
01:06:08,666 --> 01:06:12,208
- Shut up, Olympia. Who are you?
- He was scared, okay? I just let him in.

859
01:06:12,291 --> 01:06:14,666
- You let a stranger in the house!
- I'm sorry.

860
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:16,416
- He was terrified!
- Are you a simpleton?

861
01:06:16,958 --> 01:06:18,958
Oh, God. Okay. Please.

862
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:20,416
My name is Gary.

863
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:22,416
I live in the city.

864
01:06:22,916 --> 01:06:25,666
When these things came, I got
the first train out with some colleagues

865
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:27,250
because we thought it would be safe.

866
01:06:29,833 --> 01:06:34,041
Please, please just let me stay here.
They're after me.

867
01:06:34,625 --> 01:06:35,875
Who's after you?

868
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,583
- I don't believe it. He's lying.
- Who's after you?

869
01:06:38,666 --> 01:06:39,791
It's obvious he's lying.

870
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:41,375
- I swear.
- Why are you here?

871
01:06:41,458 --> 01:06:45,416
We went to my colleague Carl's
house to lay low.

872
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:49,250
Everything was fine until
they broke in.

873
01:06:50,541 --> 01:06:52,333
Creatures don't break into people's homes.

874
01:06:52,416 --> 01:06:54,500
No, not the creatures, these psychos.

875
01:06:56,375 --> 01:06:58,333
These psychos from Northwood.

876
01:06:58,416 --> 01:07:00,833
Northwood?
I don't... Where is that?

877
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:03,625
It's a mental institution
for the criminally insane.

878
01:07:03,708 --> 01:07:06,916
Well, it's nice to know
they have hall passes now.

879
01:07:07,708 --> 01:07:08,583
And then what?

880
01:07:08,666 --> 01:07:13,000
They took us outside
and they forced our eyes open

881
01:07:13,083 --> 01:07:15,458
so that we would have
to look at the creatures.

882
01:07:17,041 --> 01:07:18,041
What?

883
01:07:18,875 --> 01:07:21,041
- Did you look?
- No.

884
01:07:21,125 --> 01:07:26,916
Somehow, my friend Carl managed to tackle
one of these people to the ground

885
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,125
and the rest of us made a run for it.

886
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:32,625
I just kept on running
and running and running till I got here.

887
01:07:33,791 --> 01:07:37,375
I've been knocking on
all the doors and nobody answered.

888
01:07:38,958 --> 01:07:40,750
Until you did, so...

889
01:07:42,791 --> 01:07:43,666
Thank you.

890
01:07:54,458 --> 01:07:55,416
Birds.

891
01:07:56,666 --> 01:08:01,625
The scariest thing was
when these people broke in, they...

892
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,833
they weren't wearing blindfolds.

893
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:09,083
It's like they didn't need them.

894
01:08:09,166 --> 01:08:11,666
But they'd been outside.
You have to wear blindfolds.

895
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:12,750
Not these people.

896
01:08:13,916 --> 01:08:16,833
These crazy guys
weren't affected like everyone else.

897
01:08:16,916 --> 01:08:18,458
They wanted to see.

898
01:08:19,166 --> 01:08:20,041
They were happy.

899
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:23,458
They were so glad.

900
01:08:25,208 --> 01:08:28,500
And they said everyone needed to see.

901
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:34,458
Wait.

902
01:08:34,541 --> 01:08:37,333
Get up and get out.
It's not an orphanage.

903
01:08:37,416 --> 01:08:41,916
New guy, you had a great visit.
We really loved meeting you. Now fuck off.

904
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:46,333
And anybody who doesn't agree,
you go with him.

905
01:08:46,416 --> 01:08:48,583
- Out now!
- Douglas, that is murder.

906
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:50,083
No. This is murder.

907
01:08:50,166 --> 01:08:53,041
- Please.
- Letting strangers into this house.

908
01:08:53,625 --> 01:08:58,583
Every contact we have had
with the outside has brought us death.

909
01:08:58,666 --> 01:09:00,583
Lydia, Greg, Charlie.

910
01:09:00,666 --> 01:09:02,583
If you wanna save people out there,

911
01:09:02,666 --> 01:09:05,541
then you go right through that door
and you go do it.

912
01:09:05,625 --> 01:09:08,375
We're not bringing
any more strangers in here.

913
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:10,250
Not while I'm alive.

914
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:13,166
I won't tell you again, get up and get...

915
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:22,750
Thank you.

916
01:09:23,875 --> 01:09:25,583
You'll sleep in the garage.

917
01:09:35,333 --> 01:09:37,125
The only reason I opened that door

918
01:09:37,208 --> 01:09:39,875
is 'cause I remember
what it felt like to be outside of it.

919
01:09:41,083 --> 01:09:43,166
If you guys hadn't let me in, I...

920
01:09:44,083 --> 01:09:46,166
I feel like such a burden.

921
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:48,791
You are no more a burden than I am, okay?

922
01:09:48,875 --> 01:09:50,458
- That's not true.
- It is. It is.

923
01:09:50,541 --> 01:09:52,041
You're not soft like me.

924
01:09:53,041 --> 01:09:55,583
I'm so spoiled.

925
01:09:56,458 --> 01:10:00,708
My parents have always done
everything for me and then my husband,

926
01:10:00,791 --> 01:10:04,166
and I just...
I got soft from all that love.

927
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:08,458
Well, I was raised by wolves,
so consider yourself lucky.

928
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:17,250
If something happens to me,
I want you to take care of my baby.

929
01:10:18,125 --> 01:10:19,041
Okay?

930
01:10:19,541 --> 01:10:20,791
- No. No.
- Please.

931
01:10:20,875 --> 01:10:22,166
- It's your baby.
- Malorie.

932
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:23,500
No.

933
01:10:23,583 --> 01:10:25,750
- Promise me.
- Nothing is gonna happen to you.

934
01:10:25,833 --> 01:10:26,666
It's your baby.

935
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:27,750
- Promise me.
- Nothing...

936
01:10:27,833 --> 01:10:29,458
Please promise me.

937
01:10:31,958 --> 01:10:34,125
Yeah, okay. Yeah, of course.

938
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:43,041
What is this?

939
01:10:44,083 --> 01:10:45,791
Well, if I was just gonna tell you,

940
01:10:45,875 --> 01:10:49,750
I wouldn't have bothered
putting it in this fancy, this fancy bag.

941
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,666
I got it on the supply run.

942
01:11:00,875 --> 01:11:03,125
It's so cute.

943
01:11:04,416 --> 01:11:05,791
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

944
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:13,333
I know it's not the baby shower
you've always dreamt of.

945
01:11:13,416 --> 01:11:15,958
No, it's... It's perfect.

946
01:11:16,958 --> 01:11:20,500
And you can give it to your little one
when she's old enough, okay?

947
01:11:23,791 --> 01:11:24,791
Thank you.

948
01:11:42,041 --> 01:11:45,000
You guys, the river's speeding up.
It's time for a meeting.

949
01:11:59,708 --> 01:12:01,875
I need to talk to you about the rapids.

950
01:12:02,541 --> 01:12:04,875
The rapids are
where the water gets very bumpy.

951
01:12:04,958 --> 01:12:08,166
It's very loud. It's very dangerous,

952
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:10,916
and it's gonna be
the hardest thing we have ever done.

953
01:12:12,375 --> 01:12:17,333
And when we reach them, one of you
is gonna have a very important job.

954
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,041
One of you is gonna have to look.

955
01:12:24,375 --> 01:12:27,375
And the person who looks,

956
01:12:28,458 --> 01:12:31,333
they have to tell me
which direction to steer into

957
01:12:31,416 --> 01:12:33,041
so that I go the right way.

958
01:12:34,666 --> 01:12:37,375
Because if I look, we won't make it.

959
01:12:41,125 --> 01:12:42,791
What if we see something?

960
01:12:43,791 --> 01:12:45,500
- I'll do it.
- No, no, no, no.

961
01:12:45,583 --> 01:12:48,833
I'm... I'm the one
who will say who looks, okay? I say it.

962
01:12:49,416 --> 01:12:51,875
I'll say who goes. I'll say who looks.

963
01:12:52,458 --> 01:12:53,625
I say who looks.

964
01:13:21,625 --> 01:13:24,916
Testing. Testing. Hello?
Hello? Is anyone out there?

965
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,125
Hello? Testing, one, two, three. Hello?

966
01:13:29,958 --> 01:13:30,958
Testing.

967
01:13:34,208 --> 01:13:36,375
- I love this song.
- Me too.

968
01:13:36,458 --> 01:13:37,708
- Me too.
- Me too.

969
01:13:38,916 --> 01:13:40,875
I've never actually heard it before.

970
01:13:54,583 --> 01:13:57,291
- It could be a false alarm, right?
- All right.

971
01:13:57,375 --> 01:13:58,875
We're going upstairs to the bedroom.

972
01:13:58,958 --> 01:14:03,166
We need towels, sponges,
scissors, and lots of water.

973
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:06,666
Buckets of water. It's okay. It's okay.

974
01:14:07,291 --> 01:14:09,000
It's okay.

975
01:14:09,083 --> 01:14:10,666
It's okay.

976
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:12,708
Take it easy. I've got you.

977
01:14:12,791 --> 01:14:15,083
It's okay. It's okay.

978
01:14:45,208 --> 01:14:50,291
The scissors are in the drawer
by the side of your left hand. Yeah.

979
01:15:01,958 --> 01:15:05,291
- Okay, so the baby's coming.
- No, not happening.

980
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:07,625
- Not happening.
- It's definitely coming.

981
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:10,083
- Come with me. Come with me.
- This is not happening.

982
01:15:10,166 --> 01:15:12,750
It's happening. Let's go. Come on. Hey.

983
01:15:12,833 --> 01:15:15,125
- I have to do the water.
- We'll do the water.

984
01:15:22,083 --> 01:15:23,791
Okay, here we go.

985
01:15:29,541 --> 01:15:31,458
- You two are doing great.
- Oh, shut up.

986
01:16:02,375 --> 01:16:03,458
One more time.

987
01:16:03,541 --> 01:16:05,250
Come on. Come on.

988
01:16:42,375 --> 01:16:44,166
It's okay. It's okay.

989
01:16:47,708 --> 01:16:48,833
It's a boy.

990
01:16:54,166 --> 01:16:55,125
No.

991
01:16:56,583 --> 01:16:59,083
And your auntie thought you'd be a girl.

992
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:27,375
Hey, new guy. New guy, let me in.

993
01:17:27,458 --> 01:17:30,625
Just come and unlock the door. Come on.

994
01:17:30,708 --> 01:17:32,541
Let me out. What are you doing?

995
01:17:34,333 --> 01:17:35,208
What?

996
01:17:41,791 --> 01:17:42,833
What are you doing?

997
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:00,500
Gary?

998
01:18:03,291 --> 01:18:04,416
Gary!

999
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:06,500
Hey.

1000
01:18:06,583 --> 01:18:09,416
Tom! He put the birds in the freezer.

1001
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:12,416
Tom, I told you he's fucking crazy.

1002
01:18:22,583 --> 01:18:23,458
Ga...

1003
01:18:27,166 --> 01:18:29,833
Tom. Get the shotgun.

1004
01:18:29,916 --> 01:18:31,291
He's crazy.

1005
01:18:38,125 --> 01:18:42,666
What the fuck are you doing?
We let you into this house. We let...

1006
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:51,125
No! No! Fuck.

1007
01:18:51,833 --> 01:18:55,750
Fucking asshole.
I knew you were a fucking lunatic.

1008
01:18:55,833 --> 01:18:58,708
You fucking piece of shit. We saved you.

1009
01:18:59,833 --> 01:19:00,750
Fuck!

1010
01:19:07,083 --> 01:19:10,208
- Almost there.
- That's right. That's right.

1011
01:19:10,291 --> 01:19:12,208
Yes! Yes!

1012
01:19:12,916 --> 01:19:13,833
Yes.

1013
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:17,208
You did it, Mama. You did it.

1014
01:19:22,708 --> 01:19:23,666
Hello.

1015
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:26,416
You look so beautiful.

1016
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:28,291
What's going on down there?

1017
01:19:31,125 --> 01:19:32,000
Can I see?

1018
01:19:42,166 --> 01:19:43,750
So beautiful.

1019
01:19:43,833 --> 01:19:44,958
Thank you.

1020
01:19:47,458 --> 01:19:48,708
Can I see yours?

1021
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:02,958
Thank you.

1022
01:20:05,166 --> 01:20:06,333
Look at this.

1023
01:20:07,291 --> 01:20:08,291
Look at this.

1024
01:20:10,625 --> 01:20:12,708
- Olympia, cover your eyes.
- Isn't it beautiful?

1025
01:20:12,791 --> 01:20:16,041
No. Why are you doing this?
Gary, please don't do this.

1026
01:20:17,125 --> 01:20:18,833
- Look.
- Gary, please don't do this.

1027
01:20:18,916 --> 01:20:21,375
- Show the baby.
- No, no, no, Olympia.

1028
01:20:21,458 --> 01:20:23,125
Olympia, cover the baby's eyes.

1029
01:20:23,208 --> 01:20:24,333
Olympia.

1030
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,250
See?

1031
01:20:27,333 --> 01:20:29,958
- Show your baby.
- Olympia, let me see your baby.

1032
01:20:30,708 --> 01:20:33,000
- You're not so bad.
- Olympia, let me see your baby.

1033
01:20:34,375 --> 01:20:37,666
Keep the baby's eyes covered.
Let me see your baby, just for one minute.

1034
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:41,250
Olympia, let me hold your baby
just for one minute!

1035
01:20:41,333 --> 01:20:42,291
Just one minute.

1036
01:20:42,375 --> 01:20:44,583
Let me hold her for one minute, okay?

1037
01:20:44,666 --> 01:20:46,250
- One minute.
- See.

1038
01:20:46,333 --> 01:20:48,416
- Okay?
- See.

1039
01:20:50,541 --> 01:20:51,541
See!

1040
01:20:56,541 --> 01:21:00,875
No. Oh, no. Oh, please, no.

1041
01:21:00,958 --> 01:21:05,875
- See it. See it.
- No, no, no. No, no, no.

1042
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:38,833
Hey, Malorie.

1043
01:21:40,208 --> 01:21:41,416
Give me the children.

1044
01:21:43,958 --> 01:21:45,333
Give me the kids.

1045
01:21:46,666 --> 01:21:48,666
Give me the children or I'll take them!

1046
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:50,625
Hey, asshole.

1047
01:21:51,375 --> 01:21:52,291
Hey.

1048
01:21:54,166 --> 01:21:55,166
What are you doing here?

1049
01:21:59,291 --> 01:22:00,375
Have you come to see?

1050
01:22:02,541 --> 01:22:03,666
Open your eyes.

1051
01:22:07,666 --> 01:22:09,333
Don't be frightened.

1052
01:22:10,916 --> 01:22:12,416
Look at me. Look at me.

1053
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,500
Look at me. Look at me!

1054
01:22:48,541 --> 01:22:49,750
I'm sorry.

1055
01:22:53,125 --> 01:22:55,666
I'm sorry that you didn't get to see.

1056
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,541
It is beautiful.

1057
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:01,000
So beautiful.

1058
01:23:04,083 --> 01:23:05,250
I'm sorry.

1059
01:23:09,916 --> 01:23:11,708
It shall cleanse the world.

1060
01:23:56,750 --> 01:23:59,916
Please don't. Please don't hurt us.
Please stay away from us.

1061
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,458
Please. Please. Please. Please.

1062
01:24:02,541 --> 01:24:05,333
Please don't do this. Don't do this.
Please don't do this.

1063
01:24:09,291 --> 01:24:11,750
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1064
01:24:37,958 --> 01:24:39,541
Listen to the clicks.

1065
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:43,625
Listen to the sounds,
if they're softer or louder.

1066
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:45,958
Listen to this.

1067
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:48,166
Listen.

1068
01:24:49,083 --> 01:24:51,708
If they're louder,
you're in an open space. Do you hear that?

1069
01:24:51,791 --> 01:24:55,000
But if they're softer,
something is very close.

1070
01:24:55,083 --> 01:24:57,458
Please. Anyone. Hello? Hello?

1071
01:24:58,250 --> 01:24:59,541
Hello, hel...

1072
01:25:03,041 --> 01:25:03,916
Hello?

1073
01:25:53,833 --> 01:25:55,375
Check it out. Yeah.

1074
01:25:57,333 --> 01:25:59,291
There is nothing here.

1075
01:25:59,875 --> 01:26:02,500
- Let's go to another spot.
- Fucking time.

1076
01:26:26,916 --> 01:26:28,916
- Hey.
- Hey.

1077
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:53,708
What's wrong?

1078
01:26:55,583 --> 01:26:57,208
I heard some of them again.

1079
01:26:58,500 --> 01:26:59,458
What?

1080
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:01,791
A few of 'em...

1081
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:03,625
driving around.

1082
01:27:05,375 --> 01:27:07,833
Driving around like
they're not blindfolded.

1083
01:27:09,875 --> 01:27:10,833
Okay.

1084
01:27:12,583 --> 01:27:13,791
No more runs alone.

1085
01:27:15,583 --> 01:27:16,541
Okay.

1086
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:23,666
What's this?

1087
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:26,708
I was thinking like
a warning system for the kids.

1088
01:27:26,791 --> 01:27:30,958
- If they're in trouble, ring the bell.
- Right. That's nice.

1089
01:27:37,041 --> 01:27:38,041
How about this?

1090
01:27:39,125 --> 01:27:39,958
Oh, it's...

1091
01:27:40,708 --> 01:27:42,041
It's purely survival.

1092
01:27:42,125 --> 01:27:43,875
- Purely survival?
- Yeah.

1093
01:28:21,250 --> 01:28:23,083
Hello?

1094
01:28:23,958 --> 01:28:24,833
Hello?

1095
01:28:25,666 --> 01:28:27,625
Is anyone there? Hello?

1096
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:30,875
Testing. Testing.

1097
01:28:30,958 --> 01:28:33,916
If there is anyone there, please respond.

1098
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,625
- Hello?
- Hello.

1099
01:28:35,708 --> 01:28:37,125
Who is this?

1100
01:28:37,208 --> 01:28:39,041
My name is Rick.

1101
01:28:39,708 --> 01:28:40,625
Who is this?

1102
01:28:43,166 --> 01:28:44,375
Rick, this is Tom.

1103
01:28:44,458 --> 01:28:45,791
We have a place.

1104
01:28:45,875 --> 01:28:48,416
A compound with enough supplies...

1105
01:28:49,916 --> 01:28:50,916
We have a community.

1106
01:28:52,041 --> 01:28:53,625
It's safe here.

1107
01:28:54,416 --> 01:28:56,666
We're down by the river's end.

1108
01:28:56,750 --> 01:28:59,041
- Where are you?
- Don't answer that.

1109
01:29:00,125 --> 01:29:01,541
Near Pike's Quarry.

1110
01:29:02,125 --> 01:29:05,666
Jesus. You're a ways away.
How many of you are there?

1111
01:29:06,583 --> 01:29:08,333
Four of us.

1112
01:29:08,416 --> 01:29:09,958
Are any of them children?

1113
01:29:10,041 --> 01:29:12,583
- Don't, do not say anything.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1114
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:16,125
No. Why?

1115
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,625
Because the fastest way
to get here is by the river,

1116
01:29:19,708 --> 01:29:22,416
and I don't think
you could make it with kids.

1117
01:29:23,125 --> 01:29:24,708
Wait, the river?

1118
01:29:25,291 --> 01:29:27,041
Float downstream as far as you can.

1119
01:29:27,125 --> 01:29:29,291
Stay on the water
until you hit the rapids.

1120
01:29:30,208 --> 01:29:32,583
The water is fast there. It's dangerous.

1121
01:29:33,125 --> 01:29:34,416
We've lost some people.

1122
01:29:35,291 --> 01:29:37,375
You need to see clearly.

1123
01:29:37,458 --> 01:29:40,083
- What does that mean?
- What do you mean, see clearly?

1124
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:43,291
You will have to look.

1125
01:29:44,583 --> 01:29:46,833
- I'm telling you.
- Rick, we'll have blindfolds on.

1126
01:29:46,916 --> 01:29:48,083
We can't look.

1127
01:29:48,166 --> 01:29:50,041
I'm glad you said that.

1128
01:29:50,125 --> 01:29:51,833
Someone will have to take a...

1129
01:29:53,416 --> 01:29:57,500
Prepare for two days' journey
at the pace of the river's current.

1130
01:29:57,583 --> 01:29:59,166
Bring supplies for longer.

1131
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:01,875
How do I find you after the rapids, Rick?

1132
01:30:01,958 --> 01:30:03,208
You'll hear the birds.

1133
01:30:03,875 --> 01:30:07,041
We've got a lot of them.
Just follow the sound to us.

1134
01:30:07,125 --> 01:30:10,500
Down a small embankment,
you'll find a wall with a gate.

1135
01:30:10,583 --> 01:30:11,458
That's our...

1136
01:30:13,875 --> 01:30:15,333
- That's their what?
- That's our what?

1137
01:30:16,291 --> 01:30:17,166
Rick?

1138
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:19,458
Rick?

1139
01:30:30,791 --> 01:30:31,750
It could be real.

1140
01:30:31,833 --> 01:30:32,833
- No.
- Could be the truth.

1141
01:30:32,916 --> 01:30:35,125
- Could be is not good enough.
- What if Rick could help us?

1142
01:30:35,208 --> 01:30:36,833
And what if Rick is one of them?

1143
01:30:38,708 --> 01:30:40,291
Wait, he knew about the birds.

1144
01:30:40,958 --> 01:30:43,708
Oh, my God. Gary knew about the birds
and he put them in the freezer.

1145
01:30:43,791 --> 01:30:46,000
I cannot believe
you're actually thinking about this.

1146
01:30:46,083 --> 01:30:47,958
Every house has run out of food.
We have to move.

1147
01:30:48,041 --> 01:30:51,208
You really don't think I know that?
You don't think I know that?

1148
01:30:56,750 --> 01:30:59,125
When I was little,
we had a boat just like this.

1149
01:30:59,708 --> 01:31:01,958
And every single summer,
we would take it to the lake.

1150
01:31:02,041 --> 01:31:03,000
Every summer.

1151
01:31:03,583 --> 01:31:07,000
You guys would have loved it up there.
They had trees. They had flowers.

1152
01:31:07,583 --> 01:31:10,458
The water was warm,
the clouds were in the sky.

1153
01:31:11,291 --> 01:31:14,125
We'd all play in the water.
All the kids, all the children.

1154
01:31:14,208 --> 01:31:16,208
We would all just run
up and down the shore.

1155
01:31:16,291 --> 01:31:18,250
There were other children in the world?

1156
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,500
Yeah, just like you. Just like you.

1157
01:31:21,583 --> 01:31:23,000
Like you.

1158
01:31:23,833 --> 01:31:26,916
One day, we saw
this really, really big oak tree.

1159
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,541
It was bigger than this house.

1160
01:31:28,625 --> 01:31:31,083
It was so big and old,
I couldn't see the top of it.

1161
01:31:31,166 --> 01:31:32,583
- Guess what we did?
- Climbed it.

1162
01:31:32,666 --> 01:31:34,291
We climbed it. Yes, we climbed it.

1163
01:31:34,375 --> 01:31:36,750
We climbed it and climbed it
until we got to the top.

1164
01:31:37,708 --> 01:31:39,291
Guess what we saw when we got to the top?

1165
01:31:39,375 --> 01:31:40,875
Boy! Girl! Time for bed.

1166
01:31:40,958 --> 01:31:42,500
But Tom's telling a story.

1167
01:31:42,583 --> 01:31:45,958
- Mal, let me just... We're almost done.
- I'm not gonna say it again. Come on.

1168
01:31:48,583 --> 01:31:49,541
Girl, come on.

1169
01:31:50,958 --> 01:31:52,083
Right now.

1170
01:31:52,166 --> 01:31:53,125
Come on.

1171
01:31:53,958 --> 01:31:55,416
Right now.

1172
01:31:56,375 --> 01:31:57,250
Bed!

1173
01:32:00,833 --> 01:32:02,791
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

1174
01:32:02,875 --> 01:32:05,958
Now they think they're gonna go outside
and climb trees with all these new kids.

1175
01:32:06,041 --> 01:32:08,041
- And see butterflies and flowers!
- It's a story.

1176
01:32:08,125 --> 01:32:10,083
It's not a story. It's a lie.

1177
01:32:10,166 --> 01:32:13,000
Because they'll never climb trees,
they are never gonna make new friends.

1178
01:32:13,083 --> 01:32:15,791
- Why make them believe that?
- They have to believe in something.

1179
01:32:15,875 --> 01:32:18,166
What is this for
if they don't have anything to believe in?

1180
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:20,416
- So that they survive!
- Surviving is not living.

1181
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:22,916
They're gonna die if they listen to you!

1182
01:32:25,166 --> 01:32:28,416
Life is more than just what is. It's
what could be. What you could make it.

1183
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:31,375
You need to promise them dreams
that may never come true.

1184
01:32:31,458 --> 01:32:34,791
You need to love them knowing
that you may lose them at any second.

1185
01:32:34,875 --> 01:32:38,375
They deserve dreams. They deserve love.
They deserve hope. They deserve a mother.

1186
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:41,375
They deserve a mother.

1187
01:32:41,875 --> 01:32:44,875
You haven't given them names, Mal.
Their names are Boy and Girl!

1188
01:32:44,958 --> 01:32:45,791
Think about that.

1189
01:32:45,875 --> 01:32:48,375
Every single decision I have made
has been for them.

1190
01:32:48,458 --> 01:32:50,625
Every single one.

1191
01:33:10,625 --> 01:33:12,000
You know what I saw?

1192
01:33:14,291 --> 01:33:15,916
At the top of the tree?

1193
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:19,041
I saw a nest.

1194
01:33:21,625 --> 01:33:22,958
With five birds.

1195
01:33:23,958 --> 01:33:26,000
Sitting on the top branch.

1196
01:33:30,833 --> 01:33:32,375
And then they just flew away.

1197
01:33:58,125 --> 01:34:00,333
Got it. Got it. Sit. Sit!

1198
01:34:29,791 --> 01:34:31,166
It's safe. Come in.

1199
01:35:06,083 --> 01:35:07,583
No, you did not.

1200
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:11,375
- They're probably stale.
- Yeah.

1201
01:35:12,333 --> 01:35:13,416
Come here.

1202
01:35:14,666 --> 01:35:15,916
Just how I like 'em.

1203
01:35:17,083 --> 01:35:18,083
I'm sorry.

1204
01:35:20,416 --> 01:35:22,250
- Sorry.
- Me too.

1205
01:35:25,041 --> 01:35:25,958
Come here.

1206
01:35:42,375 --> 01:35:43,583
Kids.

1207
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:49,500
This is strawberry.

1208
01:35:49,583 --> 01:35:51,625
This is what strawberry tastes like.

1209
01:36:07,583 --> 01:36:09,333
- What's that?
- Quiet.

1210
01:36:17,666 --> 01:36:18,708
Anybody home?

1211
01:36:21,166 --> 01:36:23,500
Take the kids out the back.
I'll distract them.

1212
01:36:23,583 --> 01:36:26,458
If I'm not home in 15 minutes,
you take the kids to the boat and you go.

1213
01:36:26,541 --> 01:36:28,125
- I'm not leaving you!
- Mal.

1214
01:36:28,208 --> 01:36:30,375
- No, I'm not leaving you.
- Listen to me.

1215
01:36:31,333 --> 01:36:32,833
I love you so much.

1216
01:36:34,625 --> 01:36:36,291
I love you. Go.

1217
01:36:36,375 --> 01:36:38,250
- No!
- Go. Please go.

1218
01:36:38,958 --> 01:36:40,083
Be good. Go.

1219
01:36:40,625 --> 01:36:41,458
Go!

1220
01:36:41,541 --> 01:36:42,708
I'm coming out!

1221
01:36:44,791 --> 01:36:47,458
- Hey there, friend.
- Can I help you?

1222
01:36:49,458 --> 01:36:50,708
I don't think so, friend.

1223
01:36:50,791 --> 01:36:52,125
We can help you though.

1224
01:36:52,208 --> 01:36:53,666
No. Go!

1225
01:36:54,291 --> 01:36:56,416
- Take off your blindfold.
- Stand back.

1226
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:58,458
- Stand back!
- She's not moving.

1227
01:37:03,708 --> 01:37:05,541
Hey. Got a woman and two kids over here.

1228
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:20,916
They're coming.

1229
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,250
They won't hurt you.

1230
01:37:23,333 --> 01:37:25,041
Fuck it. Fuck it.

1231
01:37:26,208 --> 01:37:27,416
On the contrary...

1232
01:37:29,041 --> 01:37:31,041
it's a beautiful thing, friend.

1233
01:39:53,416 --> 01:39:56,833
Listen to me.
I'm only gonna say this once.

1234
01:39:56,916 --> 01:39:59,708
We are going on the trip now.
It's going to be rough.

1235
01:39:59,791 --> 01:40:04,458
You have to do every single thing I say
or we will not make it.

1236
01:40:04,541 --> 01:40:05,708
Understand?

1237
01:40:06,916 --> 01:40:08,083
Where's Tom?

1238
01:40:09,166 --> 01:40:10,291
He's not coming.

1239
01:40:28,083 --> 01:40:30,750
It's time. It's time. It's time.

1240
01:40:44,458 --> 01:40:45,625
You remember the rapids?

1241
01:40:46,708 --> 01:40:48,708
Remember I told you about the rapids?

1242
01:40:50,250 --> 01:40:51,208
Well, they're close.

1243
01:40:51,291 --> 01:40:56,541
It is very dangerous and there's only
one way for me to navigate through them.

1244
01:40:57,541 --> 01:40:58,625
Somebody has to look.

1245
01:40:59,208 --> 01:41:01,583
- I'll look.
- No. I will decide! Okay? I will decide.

1246
01:41:01,666 --> 01:41:03,541
Just give me... Just give me a second.

1247
01:41:11,375 --> 01:41:12,250
I'll do it.

1248
01:41:41,916 --> 01:41:43,500
I love you so much.

1249
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:54,625
Nobody's looking.

1250
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,041
Okay, nobody's looking.

1251
01:41:58,250 --> 01:41:59,250
Okay?

1252
01:42:09,791 --> 01:42:11,333
Do your eyes. Let's do eyes.

1253
01:42:17,791 --> 01:42:20,916
Come on. Get on your knees.
Stay down low. Hold on tight.

1254
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,666
Don't move. Hold tight.

1255
01:42:38,541 --> 01:42:41,416
Hold tight. Don't let go.
We're gonna be okay.

1256
01:42:42,875 --> 01:42:44,208
Hold on!

1257
01:42:49,625 --> 01:42:51,166
Please hold on. Hold on!

1258
01:43:33,041 --> 01:43:34,125
Girl! Boy!

1259
01:43:44,666 --> 01:43:45,833
Girl! Boy!

1260
01:43:49,916 --> 01:43:51,250
Girl! Boy! Boy?

1261
01:43:52,708 --> 01:43:53,916
Girl!

1262
01:43:57,291 --> 01:43:58,500
Malorie.

1263
01:43:59,208 --> 01:44:00,208
Boy!

1264
01:44:00,291 --> 01:44:02,833
- Keep calling me!
- Help!

1265
01:44:02,916 --> 01:44:04,708
- Malorie.
- Keep calling me.

1266
01:44:04,791 --> 01:44:05,833
Malorie!

1267
01:44:05,916 --> 01:44:07,833
- I'm right here.
- Malorie!

1268
01:44:07,916 --> 01:44:09,791
- I'm coming. Where are you?
- Malorie.

1269
01:44:09,875 --> 01:44:12,458
Where's Girl? Girl? Girl?

1270
01:44:13,375 --> 01:44:16,208
Keep ringing. I hear you. Keep ringing.

1271
01:44:30,291 --> 01:44:31,750
Keep ringing, Girl.

1272
01:44:32,333 --> 01:44:34,958
Keep ringing. Keep ringing.

1273
01:44:36,791 --> 01:44:38,208
Good girl.

1274
01:44:39,708 --> 01:44:42,750
Okay. Good job. Get up. Stand up.

1275
01:44:45,541 --> 01:44:48,583
Oh, good. Good, good, good.

1276
01:44:48,666 --> 01:44:51,000
Good girl. Okay.
Do you guys hear those birds?

1277
01:44:51,583 --> 01:44:53,875
That's where we're headed.
We just follow that sound.

1278
01:44:53,958 --> 01:44:55,791
Stay behind me.

1279
01:45:29,291 --> 01:45:31,333
Dumb-dumb. Hey, dumb-dumb.

1280
01:45:32,291 --> 01:45:35,250
Open your eyes, Malorie.
Dummy. I'm right here.

1281
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:37,916
No, no, no, no, no.

1282
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,375
No, you're not.

1283
01:45:39,458 --> 01:45:41,375
No, no, no. No, no, no.

1284
01:45:41,458 --> 01:45:43,458
Malorie, look at me.

1285
01:45:47,250 --> 01:45:50,083
Look at me. Malorie, look at me.

1286
01:45:50,166 --> 01:45:53,041
- Malorie, look at me.
- It's not real. It's not real.

1287
01:45:53,125 --> 01:45:55,708
It's not real. It's not real.
It's not real.

1288
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,833
- Malorie?
- Malorie?

1289
01:46:09,666 --> 01:46:10,625
Malorie?

1290
01:46:17,875 --> 01:46:18,791
Malorie?

1291
01:46:31,083 --> 01:46:34,291
Malorie. Malorie.

1292
01:46:34,375 --> 01:46:35,708
Look at me, Malorie.

1293
01:46:35,791 --> 01:46:37,958
- Boy. Girl.
- Malorie.

1294
01:46:38,041 --> 01:46:40,666
Don't move. Stay right where you are!

1295
01:46:40,750 --> 01:46:42,125
Open your eyes.

1296
01:46:42,208 --> 01:46:44,083
Open your eyes.

1297
01:46:44,666 --> 01:46:46,625
Malorie, open your eyes.

1298
01:46:56,166 --> 01:46:58,791
Boy. Girl. Where are you?

1299
01:47:06,083 --> 01:47:08,083
Come with me. Look at me.

1300
01:47:08,625 --> 01:47:10,916
I need you. Just look at me.

1301
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Can I really take off my blindfold?

1302
01:47:13,083 --> 01:47:14,833
- Boy!
- It's safe?

1303
01:47:14,916 --> 01:47:16,708
No, that's not me.

1304
01:47:17,875 --> 01:47:20,500
No, no, no. Keep your blindfold on.

1305
01:47:20,583 --> 01:47:22,000
Boy, that's not real.

1306
01:47:22,083 --> 01:47:24,458
Keep your blindfold on. Listen to me.

1307
01:47:24,541 --> 01:47:26,416
Listen to my voice! This is my voice!

1308
01:47:39,083 --> 01:47:40,666
Girl, come with me. Look at me.

1309
01:47:41,750 --> 01:47:43,750
Take the blindfold off.
You can look at me.

1310
01:47:43,833 --> 01:47:45,708
Isn't it dangerous if I look?

1311
01:47:46,625 --> 01:47:50,250
No. No, I'm right here. I'm right here!
Do not take off your blindfold!

1312
01:47:50,333 --> 01:47:51,541
Please listen to me!

1313
01:47:51,625 --> 01:47:52,916
- Malorie.
- What? No.

1314
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,208
- Please open your eyes.
- No. Girl, call out to me.

1315
01:47:55,291 --> 01:47:59,166
- It's just beautiful.
- Call out to me, please. Where are you?

1316
01:47:59,791 --> 01:48:02,708
Boy. Girl. Where are you?
Don't take my children.

1317
01:48:02,791 --> 01:48:04,375
Do not take my children!

1318
01:48:07,583 --> 01:48:09,750
Oh, baby, keep ringing. Keep ringing.

1319
01:48:09,833 --> 01:48:12,416
Keep ringing, baby.
I'm coming. Keep ringing.

1320
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:14,958
Come on, keep ringing. Keep ringing.

1321
01:48:15,041 --> 01:48:16,875
Oh, my God. I've got you.

1322
01:48:17,458 --> 01:48:21,416
I've got you. We're good. Where's Girl?
Where's Girl? Where's Girl?

1323
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:23,666
Girl. Girl! Girl!

1324
01:48:24,250 --> 01:48:25,416
Where's Girl?

1325
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,250
She's scared of you.

1326
01:48:27,333 --> 01:48:28,500
What?

1327
01:48:28,583 --> 01:48:30,041
She's scared of you.

1328
01:48:32,375 --> 01:48:33,375
It's okay.

1329
01:48:35,458 --> 01:48:37,250
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1330
01:48:38,250 --> 01:48:40,625
I'm so sorry, sweet girl. I'm so sorry.

1331
01:48:41,666 --> 01:48:44,125
I was wrong.
I shouldn't have been so harsh.

1332
01:48:45,166 --> 01:48:47,291
I shouldn't have stopped you from playing.

1333
01:48:47,833 --> 01:48:54,166
I shouldn't have ended Tom's story
because it wasn't finished.

1334
01:48:54,250 --> 01:48:58,083
When he climbed to the very top
of that giant oak tree,

1335
01:48:58,666 --> 01:49:01,541
he saw the most beautiful things.

1336
01:49:01,625 --> 01:49:05,125
He saw hundreds of children playing games.

1337
01:49:05,208 --> 01:49:06,291
Hundreds.

1338
01:49:06,791 --> 01:49:08,500
And he saw birds...

1339
01:49:09,458 --> 01:49:11,000
all different colored birds,

1340
01:49:11,083 --> 01:49:14,041
and... and he saw us.

1341
01:49:14,625 --> 01:49:16,958
He saw us from the very top.

1342
01:49:17,041 --> 01:49:19,666
He saw us together,
and we have to be together.

1343
01:49:20,375 --> 01:49:22,375
And it's not just a story.

1344
01:49:22,458 --> 01:49:26,458
It's not, because I have
so much I want to show you.

1345
01:49:27,041 --> 01:49:30,708
I have so much I want you to see. Okay?

1346
01:49:30,791 --> 01:49:32,958
But we have to do it together, okay?

1347
01:49:33,041 --> 01:49:36,833
So I just need you
to come to me right now, okay? Please?

1348
01:49:37,333 --> 01:49:38,375
Just come to me.

1349
01:49:38,458 --> 01:49:40,375
Baby, come to me, okay?

1350
01:49:52,416 --> 01:49:55,625
I love you so much.
I love you so much. I love you so much.

1351
01:49:55,708 --> 01:49:57,416
I love you so much.

1352
01:49:57,500 --> 01:50:00,458
We need to find the birds, okay?
Find the birds.

1353
01:50:02,125 --> 01:50:04,208
I want you to listen for the birds, okay?

1354
01:50:07,583 --> 01:50:08,666
Listen for the birds.

1355
01:50:09,625 --> 01:50:11,000
Okay, listen for the birds.

1356
01:50:20,291 --> 01:50:22,708
Listen for the birds.
Just listen for the birds.

1357
01:50:22,791 --> 01:50:24,208
Malorie.

1358
01:50:30,875 --> 01:50:31,750
Malorie.

1359
01:50:35,833 --> 01:50:38,500
Be quiet. Quiet. Quiet. Quiet.

1360
01:50:38,583 --> 01:50:40,916
Malorie,
I know you're scared, but it's me.

1361
01:50:43,083 --> 01:50:45,166
Please. Where are you, Mal? I need help!

1362
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:48,208
Just take a peek and find me.

1363
01:50:50,416 --> 01:50:51,666
Come on.

1364
01:50:52,625 --> 01:50:53,625
Come on.

1365
01:50:56,750 --> 01:50:58,583
Go to the birds. Where are the birds?

1366
01:51:03,583 --> 01:51:06,500
Where are the birds?
The birds. Where are the birds?

1367
01:51:06,583 --> 01:51:07,500
That way.

1368
01:51:10,375 --> 01:51:12,625
I can't hear the birds!
I can't hear the birds!

1369
01:51:12,708 --> 01:51:14,541
It's too loud. It's too noisy!

1370
01:51:14,625 --> 01:51:17,458
Malorie! It's too loud!

1371
01:51:29,458 --> 01:51:30,833
This way!

1372
01:52:06,708 --> 01:52:07,958
Step. Step.

1373
01:52:09,083 --> 01:52:11,750
Hello! Hello! Hello!

1374
01:52:11,833 --> 01:52:14,250
Open the door. Please open the door!

1375
01:52:14,333 --> 01:52:17,375
My name is Malorie.
I'm Malorie. I have children.

1376
01:52:17,458 --> 01:52:20,541
Please find Rick and tell Rick we followed
the river and we followed the birds.

1377
01:52:20,625 --> 01:52:21,500
Malorie!

1378
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,041
- Help!
- Look at me, Malorie!

1379
01:52:23,125 --> 01:52:25,625
- Please!
- Look at me, Malorie!

1380
01:52:25,708 --> 01:52:27,041
Malorie.

1381
01:52:27,125 --> 01:52:30,250
Okay. Just take the children.
Just take the children.

1382
01:52:30,333 --> 01:52:33,250
Take the children. They're just children.
Please let my children in!

1383
01:52:33,333 --> 01:52:36,000
- Please! Open the door!
- Look at me!

1384
01:52:38,958 --> 01:52:41,500
Let me see your eyes!
Let me see your eyes!

1385
01:52:41,583 --> 01:52:42,500
Okay.

1386
01:52:48,875 --> 01:52:49,916
She's okay.

1387
01:52:51,416 --> 01:52:53,000
She's okay. They're all okay.

1388
01:52:53,625 --> 01:52:54,625
Get Rick.

1389
01:52:55,541 --> 01:52:56,541
It's okay.

1390
01:52:58,458 --> 01:52:59,541
Malorie?

1391
01:52:59,625 --> 01:53:00,500
Yes.

1392
01:53:01,458 --> 01:53:04,166
I'm Rick. Come with me.

1393
01:53:05,791 --> 01:53:06,708
Okay.

1394
01:53:06,791 --> 01:53:08,166
Right this way.

1395
01:53:12,541 --> 01:53:14,250
You're inside and you're safe.

1396
01:53:16,375 --> 01:53:17,791
You can take your blindfolds off.

1397
01:53:45,458 --> 01:53:46,333
Come with me.

1398
01:54:14,333 --> 01:54:15,208
The birds.

1399
01:54:15,791 --> 01:54:18,541
They warn the sighted people
whenever those things are around.

1400
01:54:19,125 --> 01:54:21,375
It's not much, but it's something.

1401
01:54:33,791 --> 01:54:36,208
I'm going to get you some dry clothes.

1402
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,250
Hey.

1403
01:54:48,041 --> 01:54:52,916
What do you guys say we let the birds go
and be with their friends?

1404
01:54:53,583 --> 01:54:54,458
Shall we do that?

1405
01:54:56,750 --> 01:54:57,750
Okay.

1406
01:55:11,875 --> 01:55:12,750
Malorie?

1407
01:55:15,333 --> 01:55:16,666
Malorie Hayes?

1408
01:55:17,208 --> 01:55:18,458
Dr. Lapham.

1409
01:55:23,625 --> 01:55:24,833
And what are your names?

1410
01:55:25,416 --> 01:55:26,291
Girl.

1411
01:55:28,125 --> 01:55:28,958
Boy.

1412
01:55:32,833 --> 01:55:33,750
Actually...

1413
01:55:35,875 --> 01:55:37,416
your name is Olympia.

1414
01:55:39,041 --> 01:55:40,041
Yeah.

1415
01:55:40,708 --> 01:55:43,666
Named after the sweetest girl I ever met.

1416
01:55:45,833 --> 01:55:46,958
And your name...

1417
01:55:49,458 --> 01:55:50,708
Your name is Tom.

1418
01:55:52,708 --> 01:55:53,541
Tom.

1419
01:55:59,916 --> 01:56:01,500
And I am their mother.

1420
01:56:07,916 --> 01:56:09,500
Would you like to
play with the other kids?

1421
01:56:09,583 --> 01:56:10,708
You want to go play?

1422
01:56:11,666 --> 01:56:12,958
You want to go play?

1423
01:56:28,333 --> 01:56:30,625
Thank you. Thank you very much.
