1
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,883
Wow, it was barely
an inch when we went in.

2
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:02,422
It's so beautiful.

3
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,954
It's good,
it's good, it's good.

4
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,452
I can't feel my fingers.

5
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:39,797
Thank you.

6
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,712
* <i>... do anything for love</i>

7
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,243
You do not like this song.

8
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,288
* <i>I would do anything
for love</i>

9
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,388
* <i>I would do
anything for love</i>

10
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,949
You have to turn it off.

11
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,494
* <i>But I won't do that</i>

12
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:13,288
* <i>Oh, no, I won't...</i> *

13
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:19,126
I'm married to a cheeser!
Please, stop!

14
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,732
You love it.
Say you love it.
Stop! Ow!

15
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,275
Stop it!

16
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:25,171
You love that song.

17
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,836
Oh, Leo.

18
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,143
Hey, I have this theory.

19
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,308
Mmm-hmm.

20
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:34,909
That a girl's guaranteed
to get preggers
if she does it in a car.

21
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:38,619
What?

22
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,357
Mmm-hmm.

23
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:45,127
<i>I have a theory, too.
My theory is about moments.</i>

24
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,665
<i>Moments of impact.</i>

25
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:49,052
<i>My theory is that
these moments of impact,</i>

26
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,258
<i>these flashes
of high intensity</i>

27
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,492
<i>that completely turn
our lives upside down,</i>

28
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:57,361
<i>actually end up
defining who we are.</i>

29
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:03,674
Thanks.

30
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,903
Next in line.

31
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,909
<i>One of my absolute
favorite moments.</i>

32
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,089
Oh!

33
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:24,094
You forgot your permit.

34
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:29,859
Yeah. Well, I just sort of
come here to enjoy
the two-hour line.

35
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,426
The permit's
sort of a bonus.

36
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,970
The Art Institute.

37
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,441
You work there?

38
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:40,739
No, I'm a student.

39
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,646
I'm Paige.

40
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,252
I'm sorry. I'm Leo.

41
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:52,223
Well, thank you
for this, Leo.

42
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,122
You know what,
I noticed, in a totally
non-threatening way,

43
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,061
we have the same RPP zone.

44
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,993
Is that right?

45
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:02,928
Yup.

46
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,498
Hmm.

47
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,238
You have impressive
powers of observation.

48
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,672
Yes.

49
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,101
What's an RPP zone?

50
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,775
Residential
permit parking zone.

51
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:15,975
Oh.

52
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,016
That sounds intimate.

53
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,746
Yeah.

54
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,916
Okay.

55
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:28,190
What I was thinking
is that...

56
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,258
I think we owe it
to ourselves, really,

57
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,592
to maybe get a drink,

58
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,694
out of respect for our
zone compatibility and all.

59
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,470
Okay.
Okay?

60
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,800
Mmm-hmm.

61
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,041
All right, okay.

62
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,047
After you.

63
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,216
Pick a hand.
Pick a hand.
Pick a hand.

64
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,123
That one.
Here we go.

65
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,995
Mmm.
Mmm.

66
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,657
This is good.

67
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:11,159
* <i>Of the water's waves</i>

68
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:14,297
* <i>Still I know you're
in the darkness shining</i>

69
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:20,840
* <i>When the sun
starts coming through</i>

70
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:25,648
* <i>Or when the cardinal
chides the moon</i>

71
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,482
Let me know if you
need anything else.

72
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,385
* <i>I believe in energies</i>

73
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:34,085
* <i>That no one has to see
for us to prove</i>

74
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,253
* <i>I believe in you and me</i>

75
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:42,232
* <i>And everything
we'll ever see and do</i>

76
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,297
Oh.

77
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,372
Oh.

78
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,053
Mmm.

79
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,455
* <i>Specks of gold
in the river running</i>

80
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,293
* <i>From the deep moonlight</i>

81
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,564
* <i>When the sun
starts coming through</i>

82
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:24,239
* <i>Or when the cardinal
chides the moon</i>

83
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,948
* <i>That no one has to see
for us to prove</i>

84
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:36,644
* <i>The rain pours down
in a million rivers</i> *

85
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,018
Did you just fart?

86
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,352
No.

87
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,186
Oh.

88
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:43,920
Maybe a little.

89
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:51,268
That is so twisted.

90
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,502
But totally romantic.

91
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:59,178
God, I'm so in love
with you, it's insane.

92
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,280
<i>As you know,
your wife's CTscan</i>

93
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,013
<i>showed
intracranial hemorrhaging.</i>

94
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,816
We purposely keep patients
with traumatic brain injuries

95
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:13,551
in a comatose state
in order to calm
their systems

96
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:18,027
and allow the brain time
to heal itself while
the swelling subsides.

97
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:20,924
And then we slowly
wean them off it. Now...

98
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:24,525
<i>The thing is,
each one of us is
the sum total of</i>

99
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:27,505
<i>every moment that
we've ever experienced,</i>

100
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:30,269
<i>with all the people
we've ever known.</i>

101
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:46,521
<i>And it's these moments
that become our history.</i>

102
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:50,722
<i>Like our own
personal greatest hits
of memories that we play</i>

103
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:54,095
<i>and replay in our minds
over and over again.</i>

104
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,035
Aren't you hungry?

105
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,705
Hey.
Hi.

106
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,436
What you doing?
Nothing.

107
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,740
Really?
No.

108
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:09,371
What's that?
Nothing.

109
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:11,382
Oh, nothing?
Food's ready.

110
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,710
Look, if you keep
feeding that fleabag,

111
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:17,381
it's gonna
keep coming back
and I'm allergic.

112
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,150
Like you claim to be
allergic to cilantro?

113
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,590
I can't stand cilantro.

114
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,561
Exactly.
But you're not allergic.

115
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,995
Does anybody want
strawberries I bought
at the farmers' market?

116
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,156
Buying groceries,
bad sign.

117
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,290
What?

118
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,493
And we all know
what that means.

119
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:30,660
I like her.

120
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,938
She's like our mascot.

121
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,570
Thanks, I think.

122
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,302
I would rather have her
than that ferret you
tried to make us adopt.

123
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,571
And she
makes great coffee.
Let's keep her.

124
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:40,907
Thank you.

125
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,242
- Have some.
- Thank you.

126
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,675
"Movie"? I think you
spelled "movie" wrong.

127
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:47,944
No.

128
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,426
Told you.

129
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:58,891
Yes.
Mmm-hmm.

130
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,262
I vow to help you love life,

131
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,066
to always hold you
with tenderness,

132
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,532
and to have the patience
that love demands.

133
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,309
To speak when
words are needed

134
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,582
and to share the silence
when they're not.

135
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,775
To agree to disagree
on red velvet cake.

136
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,750
And to live within
the warmth of your heart

137
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,587
and always call it home.

138
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,285
Wow, you set the bar
kind of high.

139
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,293
Did you write
your vows on a menu?

140
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,890
Yeah. Why?

141
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,673
I vow to fiercely love you

142
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:52,612
in all your forms,
now and forever.

143
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:58,014
I promise to never forget
that this is
a once-in-a-lifetime love.

144
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,993
And to always know
in the deepest part
of my soul

145
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:09,295
that no matter
what challenges
might carry us apart,

146
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:13,769
that we'll always
find the way back
to each other.

147
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:20,211
Do you take each other
as spouses forever?

148
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,606
I do.

149
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,610
I do.

150
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:31,285
Then by the power
vested in me by
the State of Illinois, I...

151
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,849
Security.

152
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,025
I now pronounce
you man and wife
and best friends for life.

153
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,493
Kiss! Run!

154
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,839
* <i>You had to run
for the weekend</i>

155
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:51,065
* <i>And you had
nowhere to be</i>

156
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,210
* <i>You had enough
of the sorrow</i>

157
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:58,311
* <i>And it was all on TV</i>

158
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:02,882
* <i>You blew a kiss
to a goodbye and</i>

159
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:05,385
* <i>That's how you met me</i>

160
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,560
* <i>Oh, it's ours</i>

161
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,667
* <i>Oh, it's ours</i>

162
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,439
* <i>Oh, it's ours</i>

163
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,415
* <i>Oh, it's ours</i> *

164
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:38,454
I have one piece.
One piece.

165
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,553
It's...
It's not happening.

166
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:44,694
I don't...

167
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,697
Oh, my God.

168
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:48,390
You're gonna be fine.

169
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,264
Oh, my God. I'm gonna
have to call them.

170
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:51,393
I'm gonna have to call them

171
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,529
and tell them
that I can't do it.

172
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,306
Come to bed with me.

173
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,608
Come on.
I know you wanna
come to bed with me.

174
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,914
Don't!

175
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,816
Oh, no, please, no.

176
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:14,449
Stop it!

177
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,720
Okay, okay, okay.

178
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,629
I think this one's
coming along fine.

179
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,565
I mean,
I know it's not finished,

180
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,968
but I'm already starting
to see a mood.

181
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:30,942
It's got like
a darkening curtain thing
happening there,

182
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,844
and then a competing
light element, there.

183
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,005
Mmm-hmm.

184
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,413
It's abstract, but,
I mean, I don't know,

185
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,146
I kind of think
it's already powerful.

186
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,349
What?

187
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,188
You totally love me.

188
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,923
Yeah, I do.
Yeah.

189
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,197
I know because
this is my piece,

190
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,834
and that's the scrap pile,

191
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,497
which I'm now saving.

192
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,837
Hmm.

193
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:48,816
<i>A moment of
total physical, mental,
and every other kind of love.</i>

194
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,356
Don't crowd her.

195
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,325
She's gonna be
a little groggy,

196
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,232
so let's just
give her some space.

197
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,529
Hey.

198
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:16,505
It's so good to see you.

199
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,079
Paige?

200
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,245
It's okay.
You're in the hospital.

201
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,281
You were in a car accident.

202
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,292
You hit your head,
but you're okay.

203
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,124
We just kept you asleep
for a little while.

204
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,858
How do you feel?

205
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,692
My head hurts.

206
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,568
Yeah, well,
that's perfectly normal.

207
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,197
I'll get you
something for that.

208
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,572
Was anyone else hurt,
Doctor?

209
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,944
Uh...

210
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,919
Paige,
you know who I am, right?

211
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,456
Yeah. You're my doctor.

212
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:06,959
Um...

213
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,504
I'm your husband.

214
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:23,973
Paige?

215
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,929
Mr. Collins?
You said things
were very good.

216
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,666
A brain injury isn't
like a broken bone
or a laceration.

217
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,138
Brains are
much less predictable.

218
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,436
Sometimes, due to the way
the swelling tissue
presses against the skull,

219
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,671
it can cause
some impairment.

220
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,269
Some impairment?

221
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,473
She doesn't remember me.

222
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,311
Even though she's awake,
the swelling

223
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,443
can cause confusion
or memory loss,

224
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,816
erratic mood swings.

225
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:04,147
What?
But that's normal.

226
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,464
<i>So, that's my theory.</i>

227
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,197
<i>That these moments of impact
define who we are.</i>

228
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,572
<i>But what I never considered</i>

229
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:28,370
<i>was what if, one day,
you could no longer
remember any of them?</i>

230
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,354
Hi.

231
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:46,657
What are you up to?

232
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,824
Sleeping.

233
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,497
Right.

234
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,269
I brought you some clothes.

235
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,704
Thank you.

236
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:01,342
I'm kind of hungry.

237
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:03,774
Okay.

238
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,049
Come on.

239
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:15,083
So, I just wanted to
verify a few things
with you about me,

240
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,725
about us.

241
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,223
Great.
So, we're married?

242
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:20,759
Yes.
Yeah.

243
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,800
And I have weird hair.

244
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,600
I think that's
taking a narrow view.

245
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:28,465
You said it takes
too long to straighten

246
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,565
and you'd rather
use that time to
work in your studio.

247
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,406
My studio?
Why do I have a studio?

248
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,271
You're an artist.

249
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,946
Sculptor.
A really good one.

250
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,883
Right now, you're
working on four pieces

251
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,547
for the Tribune Tower lobby,

252
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,988
which is huge.

253
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:48,457
Everyone in town
wanted that commission.

254
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,892
But your show at
the MCA's 12 x 12
was amazing,

255
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,453
so you won it.

256
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,632
What about my law degree?

257
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,169
I don't have a law degree?

258
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:00,729
I think you were

259
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,330
a few credits shy.

260
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,909
Last time I wanted
to be an artist,

261
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,276
I was in high school.

262
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,683
<i>I think you need to
look at it like a win.</i>

263
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,912
Traumatic brain injury
is a win?
You're an idiot.

264
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,755
If she doesn't
remember who you are,

265
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,156
then she doesn't remember
all the stupid shit
you ever did.

266
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,750
You can start over,
wipe the slate clean.

267
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,359
I'm just worried if
she doesn't remember you,

268
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,864
how's she going to
remember she's in love
with you? What?

269
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:28,990
I was frankly
a little stunned

270
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,159
she went for you
the first time.

271
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,964
If anything, you've
become less attractive.

272
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,169
You guys are
a great support system.

273
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,144
Seriously, though.

274
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,610
What if she doesn't
remember me?

275
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,506
Then what?

276
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,509
She's gonna remember you.

277
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,178
She's gonna
remember all of us.

278
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,551
We're her family.

279
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,957
Yeah, you're right.

280
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,478
Excuse me. I'm looking
for my wife, Paige Collins.

281
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,746
She was right
over here yesterday.

282
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,578
Well, it looks like
they moved her up
to the VIP floor.

283
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,750
That sounds expensive.
It's a donor's wing.

284
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,655
Just go down here
and take the elevator

285
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,753
to the second floor
and make a right.

286
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,387
Okay. Thanks.

287
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,603
Paige, your long-term
memory recall is intact

288
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:45,075
and I'm very optimistic
the rest of your memory is
going to improve with time.

289
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,205
Mr. Collins,
I'm so glad you're here.

290
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:53,685
This is bizarre.
I'm Leo, Paige's husband.

291
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:58,288
Do you know
how disconcerting it was
to hear second-hand

292
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,086
that my daughter had been
in the ICU for weeks

293
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,193
and we hadn't been told?

294
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,028
You should have
called us.

295
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,462
I'm sorry.

296
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,094
You've never
met my parents?

297
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,227
I don't understand.
Why haven't you met him?

298
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,295
So, Doctor,
now what is
the next step?

299
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,731
The sooner
she settles back
into her life,

300
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,400
her normal routine,
the better.

301
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,036
Starting in a week or so,
I'm gonna recommend

302
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,944
that Paige see
a neural psychologist.

303
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,581
- Okay.
- Whatever she needs.

304
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,912
Therapy, specialists,

305
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,451
I'll make sure
she gets the best.

306
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,315
You'll come home
where I can
take care of you.

307
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,145
Mom can make up
your old room,

308
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:33,417
and I can take
some time off work.

309
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,389
I don't mean to
be disrespectful,

310
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,985
'cause we really
appreciate that,

311
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,265
but you just heard
Paige's doctor say

312
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,892
that she needs to go back
to her normal routine.

313
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,061
Her life with me is
her normal routine.

314
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,332
Yes, but that's a life
she doesn't remember.

315
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,564
She will.

316
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,902
That's what her doctor
just got through saying.

317
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:52,943
No. What she said was that
maybe Paige will remember.

318
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,172
Now, why not
let her come home

319
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,248
and recover with
people that she knows?

320
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,408
And loves?

321
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,246
We're only trying to
do the best for Paige.

322
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,320
That's interesting,
'cause you haven't
even asked her once.

323
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,321
Well, no, but...
What I really need
is for everyone

324
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,152
to just stop bickering!

325
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,154
Listen, none of this needs
to be decided right now.

326
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,320
No. Sorry.

327
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,796
I think you should all
head home, get some rest.

328
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:15,958
I'm sure everyone
could use it.

329
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:17,495
How is it that
you're my husband

330
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:18,967
and you've
never met my family?

331
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:22,774
You haven't spoken
to them in years.

332
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:27,011
Why would I ever stop
speaking to my family?

333
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,407
It all went down
before we met.

334
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,478
And we never talked about it?

335
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:32,777
No, we did.

336
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:35,811
So?

337
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:39,923
For starters, you wanted
to move into the city

338
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:41,288
and go to the Art Institute.

339
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:45,354
And your father insisted
that you stay in law school.

340
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,925
He had some
pretty strict views

341
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:48,124
on what you ought
to be doing.

342
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,426
Things just
spiraled from there.

343
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,832
Okay. Look,
what I remember is
being in law school

344
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,705
and being engaged to Jeremy.

345
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:04,880
I... I don't know.

346
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:13,151
Paige.

347
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:16,153
Okay, babe, babe,
just, just...

348
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:19,991
The best thing to do
at this point

349
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:23,398
is to go back
to your life with me.

350
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,661
You heard what
the doctor said.

351
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,034
It's the best thing
for your recovery.

352
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,300
Okay, but I don't know you.

353
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,502
And I'm just supposed
to get in your car

354
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,737
and go and live
at your place?

355
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,037
It's our place.

356
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,206
Without any proof of us
even being in love?

357
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:38,373
Other than our marriage?

358
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:40,417
People get married for all
kinds of different reasons.

359
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,884
Okay. Like?

360
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,318
Like for a green card.

361
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,080
I'm from Cincinnati.

362
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,391
Did I keep a journal?

363
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,726
No, not that I know of.

364
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,104
I guess this is
all he could find.

365
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,674
Oh, well.
It looks fine, honey.

366
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:15,583
I mean,
we're just going home, so...

367
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,379
It's horrible...
Paige?

368
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,214
I understand you're
finally leaving us.

369
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,852
Oh, yes, that's
what they tell me.

370
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,456
So, no driving until
I give you the say-so.

371
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,368
But other than that,
I'm gonna see you
in four to six weeks.

372
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,035
All right?
Thank you so much.

373
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:35,129
Thank you, Doctor,
for everything.
Thank you, Doctor.

374
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,935
Okay.
You ready? Let's go.

375
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:39,202
Wait, hold on.
I got a voicemail.

376
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:40,744
It's from
before the accident.

377
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,542
You said
you wanted evidence.

378
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:46,743
Okay, yeah.
Well, let's have a listen.

379
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,620
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

380
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:53,156
<i>Ugh. I'm sorry,
I'm still at my studio.</i>

381
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:56,955
<i>I miss you so bad
my sculptures are starting
to look like you.</i>

382
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:59,760
<i>So, what are
you doing later?</i>

383
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:03,492
<i>I kind of need some Leo time,
if you know what I mean.</i>

384
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:08,003
<i>Yeah. Anyway, call me back.</i>

385
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:10,237
<i>Love you.</i>

386
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:17,480
I don't know, I guess
in listening back to it,

387
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:18,981
it doesn't
exactly prove anything.

388
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,777
No, no, it's...

389
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:25,514
It's cute.
I mean, I sound happy.

390
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:30,087
Okay, look.
Think about it.

391
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:33,356
You quit law school,
you broke off your engagement

392
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:34,796
and you moved
into the city.

393
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,028
Those were all
choices that you made,

394
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,501
way before
you even met me.

395
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:41,799
I think that
you owe it to yourself

396
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:45,539
to honor those decisions,
at least for right now.

397
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:50,175
This is a mistake, Paige.

398
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,780
I promise that
I will take care of her.

399
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:57,045
Please, come home with me.
Come home with me.

400
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,114
We'll figure
this out together.

401
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,398
I guess I could
just try it out

402
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:11,697
to see if it would
help my memory and...

403
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:12,827
Mmm-hmm.

404
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:16,865
I could always come home
if I change my mind.

405
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,473
I married him. It must
have been for some reason.

406
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:22,969
A guarded endorsement.

407
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,481
But I will take it.

408
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:36,657
I look like a freak.

409
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:40,187
I think you look great.

410
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:47,428
Where do we live?

411
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:48,870
On the north side.

412
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:55,242
Who's the president?

413
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,347
Of the country?
Yeah.

414
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,344
Obama.

415
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:01,750
The senator?

416
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,381
Yeah. You voted for him.

417
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,886
I did?

418
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,461
Welcome home.

419
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:25,807
After you.

420
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:33,309
Surprise!

421
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:38,047
Uh...

422
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:40,922
It's good to see you.

423
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:42,423
We were there every day
at the hospital,

424
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,155
but Leo didn't want us
to overwhelm you.

425
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:45,923
Yeah. They were.
Every day.

426
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,487
We really missed you.

427
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:50,567
I gather we're close?

428
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:55,766
I'm Sonia. And this
is my boyfriend Kyle.

429
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,133
Hey, Paige.

430
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,266
And this is Jim.

431
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:00,110
You look great, Paige.

432
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,611
And Lily.

433
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,442
Hey. What, were you, like,
working out at the hospital?

434
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,575
- Hey, Paige.
- And Josh.

435
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:10,148
I... Sorry, I... Excuse me.

436
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:17,819
Thank you all for coming.
I'm sorry it ended early.

437
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:20,295
It's all right.
Take care, Leo.

438
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,051
Are you okay?

439
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:52,958
What do you think?

440
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:56,798
I know. It's a lot to take in.

441
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,661
No.

442
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:02,966
A lot to take in
would've been coming home,

443
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:07,500
to a strange apartment,
with a man I don't know.

444
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,046
That would be
a lot to take in.

445
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,877
But coming home
to all of that,

446
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,850
plus a house
full of people

447
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,323
pulling on me,
and hugging me,
and crying in my face,

448
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,655
and talking about more shit
that I don't remember,

449
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:25,821
that's not a lot to take in,
that's total bullshit.

450
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,355
You're right.

451
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,367
It was only supposed
to be a few people.

452
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:32,766
Will you please just get out?

453
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,206
Paige, I'm sorry.

454
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,776
Are you honestly not
gonna leave me alone?

455
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:45,281
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

456
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:47,549
Of course.

457
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:54,349
I'm sorry.

458
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:41,902
Oh.

459
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:44,942
Oh, my God.
Oh, my mother's
gonna kill me.

460
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,659
Good morning.
Good morning.

461
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,522
What?
You didn't knock!

462
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,302
It's habit. I'm sorry.

463
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:14,995
It's not like you haven't
seen it before. Come on.

464
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,812
This is not funny.
You should knock.

465
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,445
I'm sorry.

466
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,156
You look nice.

467
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:42,458
Really?

468
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:47,527
This is about the only
piece of my clothing
I feel comfortable in.

469
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:49,838
That's mine, actually.

470
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:52,002
Oh.

471
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:53,700
No, it's fine.

472
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:03,146
What?
Huh?

473
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:06,022
You're looking at me
like I'm some kind
of zoo animal.

474
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,356
Sorry, I don't know.
I'm just trying

475
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,859
to figure this out,
too, I guess.

476
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,400
You normally do all this?

477
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:20,835
This is my apology
for last night.

478
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:24,005
That was such
a bonehead move.
I just wasn't thinking.

479
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:26,336
No, please.
I'm sorry. I...

480
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:30,043
I don't want you to
worry about me, okay?

481
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:33,015
Just go about your
normal routine and...

482
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:36,920
Do you work?
Do you have a job?

483
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:41,214
Yeah. Well, that's
if I'm still in business.

484
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:45,187
I own a recording studio.

485
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:47,494
Hmm. Cool.

486
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:55,832
So, what is my routine?
What do I do all day?

487
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:57,769
Well...

488
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:02,012
You usually get up
and make coffee.

489
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,071
All right.
No, no, no.
I got it, I got it, I got it.

490
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:06,581
I did it this morning,
I think.

491
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:11,786
And then you...
Oh, no, don't.
That one's for me.

492
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,049
You don't eat meat.

493
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:16,087
Oh.

494
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:22,129
Then you check e-mails
and pay bills.

495
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,126
Okay.

496
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:27,432
Which I'm betting
that you don't remember
any of the passwords

497
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,597
or account numbers, huh?
Mmm-mmm.

498
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:30,765
So, I guess
I'll do that.

499
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,103
Okay.

500
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:35,605
And then you go down
to your studio.

501
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:37,738
I could take you down there,
show you what
you're working on.

502
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,444
You know what?
We don't have to rehash
everything right now.

503
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:42,917
I mean, just...

504
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:46,218
You go to work,
and we can make

505
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,155
flashcards later,
or something.

506
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,153
Are you sure?

507
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:52,729
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

508
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,593
Okay. Well, your, look...

509
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,262
You got keys,
phone here.

510
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:04,164
If you need me,
all my numbers
are on there.

511
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:05,966
Okay.
Okay.

512
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,343
All right.
Yup.

513
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,278
Have a good day.

514
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,775
What's up, Lil?
Hey.

515
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:40,104
Fill me in.

516
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:42,442
That guy, Pointy Shoes?
He's a really bad kisser.

517
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,443
I don't think
I'm gonna keep him
in rotation.

518
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:46,847
Okay.

519
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:50,354
Honestly, though,
it's actually been hell.

520
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,616
Yesterday, we were
somehow double-booked.

521
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:55,118
Too many clients,
that's a high-class problem.

522
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:56,817
Yeah,
but with only one studio,

523
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:59,124
it's pretty impossible
to take on both gigs.

524
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:01,529
Right? So, Dune Advertising
weren't flexible

525
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:02,690
and they rebooked
over at Soundspace.

526
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,133
Wait? What? Come on.
That's a big account.

527
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,039
They should always
be prioritized.

528
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,300
You know that.

529
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:11,466
Yeah. Look...

530
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:16,647
I can't run the sessions
and handle account
services, right?

531
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,341
This isn't
a one-woman operation.

532
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,314
It's not like
I flaked or something.

533
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:22,511
I know, I get it.
I'm not mad.

534
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:24,987
I'm just... I'm just
saying shit's slipping.

535
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:27,553
Well, I'm here now.

536
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:33,061
How's she doing?

537
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,426
She's getting there.

538
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,429
She's...

539
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:39,158
Look, thanks.

540
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:41,368
It'll be fine.

541
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,571
Okay. Good.

542
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,578
So, you'll be
at the 3:30 pitch?

543
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:51,075
Of course.

544
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:54,616
I'm going to head home,
then change,
and check on Paige,

545
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,880
but I'll be there.
Okay.

546
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,598
<i>I vow to help you love life,</i>

547
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:17,034
<i>to always hold you
with tenderness,</i>

548
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:19,975
<i>and to have the patience
that love demands.</i>

549
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:22,272
<i>To speak when
words are needed</i>

550
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,213
<i>and to share the silence
when they're not.</i>

551
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:28,548
<i>To agree to disagree
on red velvet cake.</i>

552
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:32,089
<i>And to live within
the warmth of your heart</i>

553
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:33,748
<i>and always call it home.</i>

554
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,225
<i>Did you write
your vows on a menu?</i>

555
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,390
Weird.

556
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:42,489
<i>I vow
to fiercely love you</i>

557
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,797
<i>in all your forms,
now and forever.</i>

558
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:50,505
<i>I promise to never forget
that this is
a once-in-a-lifetime love.</i>

559
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:55,109
<i>And to always know
in the deepest part
of my soul,</i>

560
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,811
<i>no matter
what challenges
might carry us apart,</i>

561
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:01,615
<i>that we'll always
find the way back
to each other.</i>

562
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,357
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

563
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:21,595
Could I have a...

564
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:23,872
One of these?

565
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,374
You don't want the usual?

566
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:27,971
I have a usual?

567
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,946
That would be perfect.
I'll have the usual.

568
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:33,809
All right.

569
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:34,942
Here you go.

570
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,783
Thank you.

571
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,691
Thanks.

572
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,733
* <i>You know you can't keep
letting it get you down</i>

573
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:57,035
* <i>And you can't keep dragging
that dead weight around</i>

574
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:00,173
Paige?

575
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:04,848
* <i>If there ain't
all that much to lug around</i>

576
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:08,351
* <i>Better run like hell
when you hit the ground</i>

577
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:15,385
* <i>When the morning comes</i>

578
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:21,156
* <i>When the morning comes</i>

579
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:25,793
Can I help you?

580
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:28,865
Could I borrow your phone?

581
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:31,736
Hello?

582
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,471
Hey, Lil.
No, I know it's 3:30.

583
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:37,537
Look, I can't. I can't.
I gotta find Paige.

584
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,809
No, no. I don't know.
Make it up.

585
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:44,884
I'm sorry. I didn't
know who else to call.

586
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,423
Get in, sweetheart.
Get in.

587
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:48,992
Oh, sweetie.

588
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:53,822
You all right?
Yeah.

589
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,035
* <i>When the morning comes</i> *

590
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:05,833
Hey.
Hey.

591
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,740
Where you been?
I was starting to
get a little worried.

592
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,439
Thought something
might've happened to you.

593
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:14,109
Sorry.
I was lost, physically.

594
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,051
Mentally,
I guess, as well.

595
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:18,850
Well, you should've
called me.

596
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:20,788
Yeah, I forgot the phone

597
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:22,586
and I don't know
your number by heart,

598
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,126
so I called my mom

599
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:26,890
and we made a day of it,
which was great.

600
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,223
She invited us
for dinner tonight.

601
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,465
Dinner? Okay.

602
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:37,638
You don't have to go.

603
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:40,404
Well, you're not
allowed to drive,
so I do have to go.

604
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,378
But that's not the point.

605
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:48,483
You know, maybe I'm gonna
wake up tomorrow

606
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:50,281
and remember everything,

607
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,323
but right now they're the
only thing I'm sure about.

608
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:58,821
Okay.

609
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:00,994
We'll go.

610
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,060
Okay.

611
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:06,795
Okay.

612
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,132
Are you gonna change?

613
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,840
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

614
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:12,806
Changing.

615
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,509
It's just a left up here
at the Caldwells',

616
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:18,946
and then a right
at the cul-de-sac,

617
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:20,984
and we're six houses
in on the right.

618
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:24,145
Oh, the Prestleys got
a new mailbox. So cute.

619
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,424
You know, this arrangement
doesn't exactly say,

620
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:30,119
"I'm sorry that
we haven't spoken,

621
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:31,354
"but now that
I have a brain injury,

622
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:33,191
"maybe you can
overlook it."

623
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:34,964
You're right.

624
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:37,694
We should've got them
forget-me-nots.

625
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,960
That's funny.

626
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,831
Actually, that is funny.

627
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:47,109
So, well, you've
already met my parents,

628
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:50,978
but my dad will say
to call him Bill,
but he prefers Mr. Thornton.

629
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:52,140
And my sister's name is...

630
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:53,547
Gwen.

631
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:56,713
I know a lot about
your family, Paige.

632
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:58,220
Right. Yeah.

633
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,688
We're married.
You know?

634
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,555
Oh, my God,
you're engaged!
I know.

635
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:09,627
Wow.

636
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,128
You guys make
a really cute couple.
Oh, thanks, Paige.

637
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,167
Wow.

638
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,701
It has been forever.

639
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:18,968
Has it?

640
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:20,101
Yeah.

641
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:23,544
The weird thing is
that everyone looks
a little bit older.

642
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,638
Really?
Yeah. You, especially.

643
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:28,378
Oh, I'm... I'm so happy
to have you back.

644
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,851
<i>Voilá.</i>

645
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:33,854
In honor of Paige
being home, I made
your favorite dinner.

646
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:35,883
Filet mignon.

647
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:39,359
Oh, please.
Please. Sit down.

648
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:46,698
Before we start,
I think this evening
deserves a toast.

649
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:47,998
Darling?

650
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:51,007
Well, I... I would like
to drink to my family.

651
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:57,476
I am so fortunate
to have these three
beautiful women in my life

652
00:41:57,548 --> 00:42:01,541
and, when we're all together,
that fortune just multiplies.

653
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:03,547
Paige, honey,
welcome home.

654
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,254
To family.

655
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,052
To family.

656
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:12,724
So, Leo,
what about your family?

657
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:15,164
Do you see them often?

658
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:16,358
No.

659
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:17,525
Oh, that's a shame.

660
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:20,030
Both my parents are dead.

661
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,328
It's just Paige.

662
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:25,199
She's my family now.

663
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:31,705
And what kind of
work do you do, Leo?

664
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:34,842
I just opened up my own
recording studio downtown.

665
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:38,685
Paige actually convinced me
to turn it into a business.

666
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:41,616
I did?

667
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:42,885
Yeah.

668
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,864
Isn't that sort
of a dying field?

669
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,565
No, I just mean,
can't people record things

670
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:52,761
on their computers at home

671
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,929
and they sound just as good?
Ryan.

672
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,267
What?

673
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:57,863
Look, the records
that I like,

674
00:42:57,942 --> 00:43:01,309
they have life
and warmth and soul.

675
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,571
Like the slapback
on Scotty Moore's guitar
on <i>Mystery Train.</i>

676
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,584
Look,
you're not gonna get that
in your computer.

677
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:11,052
You're gonna want
a live room, you're gonna
want to bounce to tape.

678
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:15,217
You're gonna want
real musicians in a room,
vibing off of each other.

679
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:16,589
You...

680
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:19,823
I guess,
to answer your question,
it may be a dying field

681
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:24,299
and you can record
high-quality stuff at home.

682
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:27,263
But, I mean, come on,

683
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:30,273
you can't get
the <i>Sun Sessions</i>
on your laptop.

684
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:35,073
Wow.

685
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,806
Wow.

686
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,681
Wow.
Wow.

687
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:47,520
I heard everyone is
gonna be here tonight.

688
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,650
This kind of thing
might be a little
too much for Paige.

689
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,126
Oh, no,
I'm good here, actually.

690
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,766
Isn't that Diane Chain?

691
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:01,137
Yeah, we don't
really hang out
anymore.

692
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:03,969
God, you have been
away a long time.

693
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:05,133
Oh, my God!

694
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,536
Good luck, man.

695
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,876
Hi.
Hi!

696
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:15,843
Sorry. Leo,
these are my friends
from high school.

697
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:17,978
This is Shana,
Carrie, Lizbet.

698
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:19,283
Hi.

699
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,459
What about me?
I don't get
an introduction?

700
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:26,687
Hi.

701
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:27,821
Hi.

702
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:32,899
Sorry, this is...

703
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:34,899
Jeremy.

704
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,670
It's been a long time.

705
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:39,007
Has it?

706
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:43,313
It doesn't seem like it.
You haven't changed a bit.

707
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,974
I'm not sure if she
mentioned it. I'm Leo.

708
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,211
Hi.
Paige's husband.

709
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:50,878
Right.
I'm gonna grab a drink.

710
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:52,148
You guys want anything?

711
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:53,348
Disaronno sour?

712
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:54,721
I'll have
a blueberry mojito.

713
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:55,985
Really?

714
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,823
Yes, I remember.

715
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:03,227
Oh, my God, Paige.

716
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:04,527
Do you remember
when we were
in the ninth grade,

717
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:06,000
and we were getting ready
for the Christmas dance,

718
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,867
we were
curling your hair...

719
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:09,906
We ended up
burning off half your hair.

720
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:12,032
I totally remember that!

721
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:15,003
And didn't I wind up
having to wear a beret
to the dance?

722
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:16,478
No, no, no,
that was the...

723
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,486
It was like she was
some sweater-set wearing,

724
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,887
mojito-drinking
sorority girl.

725
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:29,015
Like a Stepford wife?

726
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,553
Yeah, basically.

727
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:32,856
She was even
flirting with Jeremy
right in front of me.

728
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,261
Ex-fiancé Jeremy?

729
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:35,592
No, no. No.

730
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:38,566
In her mind,
it's current fiancé Jeremy.

731
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:41,599
Which is why
it was probably
pretty annoying

732
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:45,266
to have her stranger husband
cock-block her all night.

733
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:48,937
That is a lot to
get my mind around.

734
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,540
So, what turns her on?

735
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:54,044
Paige?

736
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:55,278
No, her mother.

737
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:56,875
Yes, Paige.

738
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,112
Like, in bed?

739
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:00,622
Oh, my God, Leo.

740
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,248
What?
It's private. It's...

741
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:03,917
I don't know.

742
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:05,756
It's... It's kind of
a between-me-and-her
kind of thing.

743
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,955
Hey, I'm not gonna judge.

744
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:11,562
She likes being tickled.

745
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:13,935
Seriously?

746
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:16,198
Wow. Thought you
weren't gonna judge.

747
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,968
I'm not. I'm just... I...

748
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:19,269
I don't care if
you're into kink.

749
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:21,207
It's not like that.

750
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,712
It just breaks her down
when she's stuck in her head.

751
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:26,248
Okay.
You should give that a shot.

752
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,142
Seriously?

753
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:29,446
Yeah. What do
you have to lose?

754
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,331
Hey, Lisa.
Hey.

755
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:49,731
Paige?

756
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:53,470
Because I've been dealing
with these people forever
and I know they have...

757
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:59,448
Something important
just popped up.

758
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:01,609
I'm gonna call you
right back. Okay.

759
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:06,586
Hi.
Hi.

760
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:08,754
Please.

761
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:20,097
So, you remember
that time at the lake,

762
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:24,135
when you told me you'd
always have my back,
no matter what?

763
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:25,300
The night
in the boathouse.

764
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:26,808
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

765
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,272
Yeah.

766
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:32,145
So, can you please tell me
what went down with us?

767
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:34,947
Only you, Paige,
can dump a guy,

768
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,043
then come back
and demand answers.

769
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:41,146
So I dumped you?

770
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:45,127
A cruel, hard,
pre-wedding dumping.

771
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:48,226
Why?

772
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:51,827
Well, that's a question
that I and all of my friends

773
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:53,870
and the two rebound girls,

774
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:55,836
yeah, we'd all
love an answer to.

775
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:57,304
Come on, seriously.

776
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,171
I must have had
some kind of reason.

777
00:47:59,243 --> 00:48:00,574
You...

778
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:03,068
You... You changed.

779
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:08,049
You talked differently,
you dressed differently.

780
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:10,720
You weren't sure
about law school anymore.

781
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:15,355
And you definitely weren't
sure about me anymore.

782
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:18,589
Did I give you
your ring back?

783
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:20,185
Yeah, you did.

784
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:23,761
Who has that now?

785
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:25,391
No one yet.

786
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:28,498
But I've been with Rose.

787
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,267
You remember?
From Gwen's class.

788
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:33,275
I've been with Rose
for about a year now.

789
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:38,177
I couldn't wait
forever, Paige.

790
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,716
You couldn't
have anticipated

791
00:48:40,784 --> 00:48:45,084
that I'd have a brain trauma
and forget our break-up

792
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:46,849
and come waltzing
into your office

793
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,551
demanding answers?

794
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:49,785
What's wrong with you?

795
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:55,122
I'm sorry. I'm gonna
let you go back to work.

796
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:56,631
Sure.

797
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,915
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

798
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:14,779
I was not expecting that.

799
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:16,750
Habit, I guess.

800
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:24,550
I honestly didn't even know
where I was headed until
I found myself here.

801
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,327
It just seems
so ridiculous to me

802
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:30,992
that I shut everyone out
for five years.

803
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,236
It just doesn't feel right.

804
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:52,679
Hey.

805
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,815
Hey.
How was your day?

806
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:58,121
Uh...

807
00:49:58,195 --> 00:49:59,662
It was fine.

808
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:04,492
I'm just happy to
be home with you.

809
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:08,961
Sorry about the mess here.

810
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:10,506
No problem.

811
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:12,602
What, are you collaging?

812
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:13,938
Do I collage?

813
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:17,337
No, not that I remember.

814
00:50:18,982 --> 00:50:21,610
No, you know,
I was just so inspired

815
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,812
just seeing
everybody last night.

816
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:25,352
To collage?

817
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:27,548
All those memories
just came flooding
back to me,

818
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:31,354
so I thought
I'd make a timeline,
you know, of my life.

819
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:35,026
That's... That's great.
That's a great idea.

820
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:37,161
Yeah.

821
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:40,533
I kind of rummaged through
some of your stuff.
I hope you don't mind.

822
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:44,633
It's fine. It's fine.
What's mine is yours.

823
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,199
I even have a certificate
from the State of Illinois
to prove it.

824
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:49,676
Yes, I found that.
It's in the lost years.

825
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:52,575
See, I started over here.

826
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:56,049
I found some family photos,
me when I was little,
stuff like that.

827
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,914
That was easy to put
into chronological order

828
00:50:58,021 --> 00:50:59,249
because I remember
that stuff.

829
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:00,550
That's good, right?

830
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:02,386
Yeah, yeah. I guess so.

831
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:04,255
But what I've
been trying to do

832
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:06,488
is pinpoint
the last memory I had

833
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:09,031
before everything
just went blank.

834
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:11,561
How's that going?

835
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:14,200
I think I was
at the Macaroni Grill,

836
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:17,832
and I was asking them
if they had those special
toasted ravioli.

837
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,274
And I don't
remember the answer.

838
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:22,743
That's it, that's all,
that's my last memory

839
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:25,178
before I woke up
in a hospital.

840
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:29,719
Oh, no.
How are we ever gonna know
if they had toasted ravioli?

841
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:37,686
God, this is
not happening.

842
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,058
It's okay.

843
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:40,357
This is not happening.

844
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:43,422
Okay? No, no, no, no,
please don't do that.

845
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,962
Come on.
What...

846
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:51,272
What are you doing?

847
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,569
I'm sorry.

848
00:51:54,544 --> 00:51:58,275
I'm sorry. Was that...
That was one of our things?

849
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:00,607
Yeah, kind of. It...
I'm sorry...

850
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:01,774
No. You don't have
to say it.

851
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:04,080
You don't. I get it.
It'll all come back.

852
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:06,418
We just have to keep
doing what we're doing,

853
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:08,151
let you fall back
into your life.

854
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:10,249
It'll
all sort itself out.

855
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,619
Yeah.

856
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:19,803
<i>About a dozen downtown
businesses were boarded up...</i>

857
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:23,204
<i>About a dozen downtown
businesses were boarded up...</i>

858
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:26,298
<i>Glass littered sidewalks,
following two nights
of protests</i>

859
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:27,502
<i>over the police
shooting of an...</i>

860
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:28,669
Hey.

861
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:30,439
<i>There were few people
on the street.</i>

862
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:32,515
I think I'm ready
to see my studio now.

863
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:33,947
Will you show it to me?

864
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:35,314
Yeah.

865
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:36,784
Come on.

866
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:59,464
This is the first studio
you've ever had to yourself.

867
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:03,238
It's a cool space, huh?
Wow.

868
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:11,687
You weren't sure
you liked it at first,
though.

869
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:14,883
Until you had this idea
to burn some smudge stick

870
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:18,392
that you bought from some guy
on the corner of Diversey.

871
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:20,687
We lit this thing

872
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:21,856
and we started
waving it around

873
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:25,868
until we realized
that it was just some
old pieces of lettuce.

874
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:30,365
So, we're waving around
burning lettuce.
I don't know.

875
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:33,671
But it must've done
the trick, though,

876
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:37,076
'cause after that,
I couldn't get you
out of here.

877
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:41,714
You would come in
and crank your music,

878
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:43,582
and you'd get lost
in a project,

879
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:46,781
and I'd have to
come and remind you
that it was night-time.

880
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:53,526
This is one of your pieces
for the Tribune Tower series.

881
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:55,724
What is it
supposed to be?

882
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:59,091
I'm not sure if
you even knew yet.

883
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:03,397
But come here.

884
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,306
I...

885
00:54:05,942 --> 00:54:10,743
Here,
just help it figure out
what it wants to be.

886
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:17,250
Okay.

887
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:18,879
I don't...
I don't really know

888
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:20,388
how to use this thing.

889
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:23,290
Sure you do.
Wait, hold on.

890
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:32,594
That's better. Come on.

891
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:34,432
Just try it.
It might be fun.

892
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:36,938
Can you just turn down
the music, please?

893
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:38,668
I swear you used
to listen to it

894
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,003
so much louder than this.

895
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,236
I never could understand
how you would just

896
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:42,403
be able to focus...

897
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:44,572
I have a clinically bad,
goddamn headache!

898
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:47,082
Please turn down the music!

899
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:56,983
I'm trying to help you!

900
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:02,855
But I am not
your punching bag.

901
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:07,630
We don't speak to
each other like this.

902
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,375
This is hard for me,
too, Paige.

903
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:00,321
Paige?

904
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:01,857
Yeah?

905
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:04,887
Hey.
Hey.

906
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:06,859
I passed by that
little Portuguese bakery

907
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:08,557
that you love
on the way home,

908
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:10,496
and I got us some...

909
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:16,363
Is somebody here?
Yeah.

910
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,744
Leo.
Hey.

911
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:27,110
My sister's just
up to her eyeballs
with this wedding stuff,

912
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,048
and we've got
the engagement party
coming up.

913
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,555
And we all thought
Paige could come home
and help her out.

914
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:35,090
It just seems like
the right thing to do,

915
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:36,716
to be there for Gwen.

916
00:56:39,262 --> 00:56:42,231
Okay. But what
about your life here?

917
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:47,061
What about all the work
that you haven't finished?

918
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,162
I talked to the people
at the Tribune.

919
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:51,502
And they were
really understanding
about the accident,

920
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:53,337
and Dad's gonna
loan me the money

921
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:55,604
to pay back
their advance, so...

922
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:58,146
I don't know.
I just... I can't do it.

923
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,739
You just come out
when you're ready, honey.

924
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:02,580
Okay, thanks, Dad.

925
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:10,452
I'm sorry. It's just
until after the wedding.

926
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:13,255
I just want you to
be careful, okay?

927
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,594
Well, I'm not
joining a cult.

928
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:17,496
I'm just going to
stay with my family.

929
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,534
I know, but...
But what?

930
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:28,110
Can I at least give you
an awkward hug?

931
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,195
So, how are you feeling?

932
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,629
Mmm. I feel fine.

933
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:52,862
Yeah? No dizziness,
disorientation, sleepiness?

934
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,800
Nope.
Great.

935
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:57,567
Well, I'm very happy,
and your CT scan
looks excellent.

936
00:57:57,674 --> 00:57:58,732
Oh.

937
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:00,571
What a relief. Well...

938
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:03,544
So, your memory recall,
anything?

939
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:04,908
Not really.

940
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:06,242
No, huh?

941
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:08,214
That's not normal, is it?

942
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,411
Listen, when it comes
to the brain,
nothing is normal,

943
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,647
because
no two brain injuries
are the same.

944
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:15,589
Paige seems
perfectly herself again.

945
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:17,250
It's wonderful.

946
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:20,094
Mrs. Thornton, could
I just talk to Paige alone
for a moment, please?

947
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:24,762
It's okay, Mom.
I'm... I'm good.

948
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,035
All right.

949
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:31,935
Thanks.

950
00:58:39,249 --> 00:58:42,218
Paige, do you want
to regain your memory?

951
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:43,411
Yes.

952
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,714
Because
some patients fear

953
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:46,049
that when their memory
comes back,

954
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:47,521
so will the memory
of the trauma,

955
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:48,921
but mercifully
that's rarely the case.

956
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:51,186
Oh, no, that's not it.
I'm... I'm...

957
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:53,228
I'm not afraid
of the accident.

958
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,520
So, what are you afraid of?

959
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:02,702
I guess I just...
I don't know. It's...

960
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,870
I mean, what if I don't
like the life that I had?

961
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:08,535
Or what if
I like it too much?

962
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:09,908
I...

963
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:11,879
I just don't know.

964
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:14,112
I only did
one psych rotation,

965
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,310
so this may be
terrible advice.

966
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,383
But I think you have to
try and fill the holes.

967
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:23,623
You can still decide
you want a different life,

968
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,717
but if you don't
at least

969
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:27,228
open yourself up
to remembering,

970
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:30,892
I'm afraid you're
gonna live in fear
of your own past.

971
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:35,433
Hey. I'm here.

972
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:39,274
These guys are?

973
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:42,106
Knife Skillz, with a Z.

974
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:43,440
Right.

975
00:59:44,347 --> 00:59:47,680
Okay, Mikey, sounds amazing.
Let's just go for it.

976
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:50,318
<i>I am going for it.</i>

977
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,853
The bass line
is one note.

978
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:53,114
Just one note.

979
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:54,281
Okay, cool.

980
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:56,156
Take two.

981
00:59:59,662 --> 01:00:00,924
Wow.

982
01:00:00,997 --> 01:00:02,760
You look different.

983
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:05,858
Yeah. Going for
a Kanye kind of thing.

984
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:07,596
I'm gonna say
more Michael Bublé,

985
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:09,194
but, whatever,
it's still good.

986
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:10,430
Hmm.

987
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:15,672
So... I'm gonna be
in and out for a while.

988
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:20,848
Sounds really good,
Mikey.

989
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:24,716
Let's just take it from
the top or the middle
or wherever.

990
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:29,725
You know what?
People come here to
work with you, okay?

991
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:32,727
I mean, I'm doing my best,
but you gotta be here.

992
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:34,160
I know.

993
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:37,624
But if Paige is
in Lake Forest
with her family,

994
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:39,358
that's where I gotta be.

995
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:42,199
I gotta make my wife
fall in love with me again.

996
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:55,642
- Oh, you found each other.
- Hi!

997
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:57,549
Hi.
Let's see it.

998
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:00,418
It's good to see you.
All right, take it easy.

999
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:02,388
The countdown's on, man.
Hey, man.

1000
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:04,186
One week left of
your former life.

1001
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,420
How you feeling?

1002
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:07,359
I feel pretty good,
actually.

1003
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:09,193
I mean,
I do get a little dizzy

1004
01:01:09,265 --> 01:01:10,596
if I think about it
for too long, but...

1005
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:11,758
What?

1006
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:16,027
No, honey, it's like
a good dizzy. It's like...

1007
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:19,233
It's like panic
or excitement.

1008
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:24,213
Well, panic and excitement
are different.

1009
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,838
Honey, there's gonna
be 400 people there.

1010
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:27,109
Right.

1011
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:30,676
Hey, do you also
have a little tingling
in your fingers?

1012
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:33,381
Yeah. Is that bad?

1013
01:01:33,623 --> 01:01:34,715
Do you listen
to Radiohead?

1014
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:35,883
Uh-huh.

1015
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:39,553
Thom Yorke, he talks about
dizzy spells all the time.

1016
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:42,092
He says when
his fingers tingle,

1017
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:45,657
that's how he knows
that he's creating
something genius.

1018
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:47,292
And then he gets
so amped up playing

1019
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:49,337
that he almost passes out.

1020
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:53,000
Ryan, it sounds to me
like you're on
the verge of genius.

1021
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:55,236
That's cool, man.
Cheers.

1022
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:57,677
Ooh, Ryan, I have someone
I want you to meet.

1023
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,077
Mom, you listen
to Radiohead?

1024
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:00,672
Yeah. Why wouldn't I?

1025
01:02:00,783 --> 01:02:02,808
So, is that true?

1026
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:04,579
Mmm-hmm.

1027
01:02:11,427 --> 01:02:12,485
Paige?

1028
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:15,162
Hey, Leo.

1029
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:20,769
What?
Your hair.

1030
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:22,304
It looks so different.

1031
01:02:23,272 --> 01:02:24,466
You look beautiful.

1032
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:25,666
Thank you.

1033
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:28,641
Okay, look, so I've been
thinking about something.

1034
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:30,109
Okay.

1035
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:31,441
What's your favorite book?

1036
01:02:32,782 --> 01:02:34,613
It's probably not
what you remember.

1037
01:02:34,717 --> 01:02:36,617
That's fine.
That's not the point.

1038
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:39,154
Okay. <i>The Beach House</i>
by James Patterson.

1039
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:41,315
No, really?
Yeah.

1040
01:02:41,457 --> 01:02:44,017
Okay. <i>The Beach House.</i>

1041
01:02:44,961 --> 01:02:47,953
Okay, if it was great,
you probably loaned it
to somebody, right?

1042
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:50,055
Yeah. Gwen, I think.

1043
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:52,827
Okay, and you probably
said to yourself,

1044
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:55,336
"God, I wish
I was the person
that hadn't read it,

1045
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:57,838
"so that I could
experience it
all over again."

1046
01:02:57,907 --> 01:02:59,841
Yeah, I guess so.

1047
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:01,843
That's how I think
we should look at this.

1048
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:05,241
What?

1049
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:08,346
You can't remember how we met.

1050
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:09,509
Mmm-hmm.

1051
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:11,883
And you can't remember
how we fell in love.

1052
01:03:11,988 --> 01:03:14,650
And in a way,
yeah, that sucks.

1053
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:18,888
But it was
the greatest time of my life.

1054
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:21,491
I just thought
how cool it would be

1055
01:03:21,564 --> 01:03:23,429
to get to experience it
all over again.

1056
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:27,032
Like reading your favorite
book for the first time.

1057
01:03:27,103 --> 01:03:28,900
Exactly.
Got you.

1058
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:31,568
Which is why I want to
ask you out on a date.

1059
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:35,441
A date?

1060
01:03:35,545 --> 01:03:37,775
Like two people that are just
meeting for the first time.

1061
01:03:38,614 --> 01:03:40,013
Jeremy...

1062
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:42,842
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1063
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:45,854
Well, I don't know.
I mean, you know,

1064
01:03:45,922 --> 01:03:47,617
we've got
the wedding coming up.

1065
01:03:47,723 --> 01:03:49,384
But if we go out
before then,

1066
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:51,790
you might still be able
to take me as your date.

1067
01:03:51,894 --> 01:03:53,384
I can't promise anything,

1068
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:55,794
but I'll put in
a good word for you.

1069
01:03:57,633 --> 01:03:59,100
All right.

1070
01:03:59,202 --> 01:04:00,635
Yeah?
A date.

1071
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,872
So, I have an idea,
but it involves
going into the city.

1072
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:15,542
You okay with that?

1073
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:16,710
Yeah, that's fine.

1074
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:19,277
I just have to be back
by 10:00 in the morning.

1075
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:20,480
Oh, my God.

1076
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:21,614
What?

1077
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:22,917
First date
and you're already

1078
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:24,584
inviting yourself
to stay the night?

1079
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,787
I'm just a little
scandalized is all.

1080
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:27,988
No, I just meant...

1081
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:30,395
Don't worry.
I'll have you back tonight.

1082
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:32,400
If you wanna
stay the night, that's...

1083
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:34,902
I mean, it's...
If you want...

1084
01:04:35,137 --> 01:04:38,106
You wanna just see
how it goes? All right.

1085
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:40,904
* <i>You can love me foolishly</i>

1086
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:44,970
* <i>Love me foolish-like</i>

1087
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:53,015
* <i>Well, I wake</i>

1088
01:04:53,122 --> 01:04:56,250
* <i>In the morning and dress</i> *

1089
01:04:56,325 --> 01:04:58,156
Should we get out?

1090
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:00,126
We don't have to.

1091
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:02,090
Is this the part of the date
where I find out

1092
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:03,631
you're not
actually my husband

1093
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:05,189
but some crazy stalker,

1094
01:05:05,301 --> 01:05:07,360
and you're gonna strangle me
with my purse?

1095
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:10,496
No. This is
the exact parking spot

1096
01:05:10,606 --> 01:05:12,096
where we first met.

1097
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:14,373
Oh.

1098
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:17,944
I'm gonna take you on
a little retrospective of us.

1099
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:26,651
Mmm.

1100
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:29,319
That is so good.

1101
01:05:29,792 --> 01:05:31,783
You ready for dessert?

1102
01:05:31,861 --> 01:05:33,453
Dessert?
Hmm.

1103
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:35,328
We just had waffles.

1104
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:37,059
Mmm-mmm.
This is dinner.

1105
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:40,792
These are dessert.

1106
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,837
Well, how do you know
what flavors they all are?

1107
01:05:45,908 --> 01:05:49,639
It's like a chocolate
Russian roulette.
It's part of the fun.

1108
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:51,236
We'd be surprised
by the ones we liked

1109
01:05:51,347 --> 01:05:52,712
and the ones we didn't.

1110
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:53,975
Okay.

1111
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:57,211
And...

1112
01:05:58,554 --> 01:05:59,680
You don't like it?

1113
01:05:59,755 --> 01:06:01,222
I do not like that one.

1114
01:06:01,324 --> 01:06:04,157
Here. Try this one.
I think you'd
like this one.

1115
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:11,095
Oh?
Mmm.

1116
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,259
Told you.
Okay.

1117
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:16,570
Your turn.

1118
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:21,703
Are we going
shot for shot?

1119
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:29,878
Wait till you try
their hot chocolate.

1120
01:06:29,952 --> 01:06:32,011
We would come here
whenever it snowed.

1121
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:34,079
Are you trying to make me
diabetic or just fat?

1122
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:35,521
No, I...

1123
01:06:40,296 --> 01:06:42,287
You got a...
It's still in your hair.

1124
01:06:55,311 --> 01:06:59,077
So, we come
down here at night
and look at the lake?

1125
01:06:59,882 --> 01:07:02,146
That's not
exactly what we do.

1126
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:08,656
I... I'm not...

1127
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:10,584
I don't...

1128
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:11,956
No, no, it's not that.

1129
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:14,291
We said we'd go in
once a month every month,

1130
01:07:14,397 --> 01:07:15,728
and we haven't
done April yet.

1131
01:07:16,832 --> 01:07:18,629
We started in July.

1132
01:07:21,904 --> 01:07:24,236
Why? Why would we do that?

1133
01:07:24,306 --> 01:07:26,103
We were at
this spaghetti place,

1134
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:28,166
and we had this waiter
and he said he did it.

1135
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:30,643
And he was, like, 80.
So we thought we could.

1136
01:07:30,746 --> 01:07:32,179
Yeah.

1137
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:33,906
Now, we said
no wetsuits, but...

1138
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:35,109
You're serious.

1139
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:37,675
...for you, I guess
I'll make an exception.

1140
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:47,425
All right. Turn around.

1141
01:07:48,998 --> 01:07:50,488
Turn around.

1142
01:08:01,177 --> 01:08:02,269
Okay.

1143
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:04,974
Wait. No wetsuit?

1144
01:08:05,047 --> 01:08:06,275
We said no wetsuits, right?

1145
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:11,977
Yeah.

1146
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:17,625
Oh, no.

1147
01:08:17,693 --> 01:08:19,285
No, no. No, no!

1148
01:08:33,142 --> 01:08:34,404
Come on.

1149
01:08:45,588 --> 01:08:46,680
Thank you.

1150
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:51,552
Heat, heat.

1151
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:53,491
My left eyelid's
frozen shut.

1152
01:08:59,368 --> 01:09:01,359
I can't feel my fingers.

1153
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:04,999
I can't feel them.

1154
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:20,016
I don't know
what your Paige
did on a first date,

1155
01:09:20,089 --> 01:09:24,355
but with me, you're
only getting to first base.

1156
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:27,456
Okay.

1157
01:09:32,735 --> 01:09:34,396
I'm sorry.
I can do better.

1158
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:36,404
My... My lips
are still numb.

1159
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:41,232
It's nice.

1160
01:09:50,152 --> 01:09:51,915
Second base, tops.

1161
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:55,084
This is perfect.

1162
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:18,973
Thank you for coming out
with me tonight.

1163
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:21,276
I had a really nice time.

1164
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:26,682
I've missed you.

1165
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:30,424
I miss our life together.
I miss being with you.

1166
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:36,363
I love you.

1167
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:47,100
I should
probably get inside.

1168
01:10:50,312 --> 01:10:51,677
Good night.

1169
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:53,179
Good night.

1170
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:13,732
Hey.

1171
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:17,668
Hey. I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

1172
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:19,932
Were you out
with Jeremy?

1173
01:11:20,042 --> 01:11:21,270
No.

1174
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:23,439
I was with Leo.

1175
01:11:24,913 --> 01:11:26,540
I like him.

1176
01:11:29,184 --> 01:11:30,412
Yeah.

1177
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,277
Me, too.

1178
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:36,580
Are you okay?

1179
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:45,062
Paige, I've never seen
you like this before.

1180
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,568
I mean, is this
crying thing the new you?

1181
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:49,536
Because it's bizarre.

1182
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:51,539
I don't know.
I don't know what's me.

1183
01:11:51,607 --> 01:11:53,199
I have a tattoo.

1184
01:11:56,445 --> 01:11:58,640
And I'm a vegetarian, too.

1185
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:03,749
Look, it was just
like it used to be.
It was better, actually.

1186
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:06,315
Everything that
I fell in love with

1187
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:08,652
about Paige
is still there.

1188
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:12,154
You know, to you,
I'm sure it seemed

1189
01:12:12,261 --> 01:12:13,592
like a confirmation
of your love

1190
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:15,425
or your marriage, right?

1191
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:16,794
But to her,
it probably seemed more

1192
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:18,298
like a really good
first date.

1193
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,334
Exactly. Which is why
I think you've gotta wait

1194
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:21,960
the requisite three days
before you call.

1195
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:24,232
I gotta wait three days

1196
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,773
to call after a date
with my own wife?

1197
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:28,401
At least.
This is a unique case.
Maybe longer.

1198
01:12:28,477 --> 01:12:29,501
It can't be longer.

1199
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:30,805
I'm gonna see her
on Saturday at the wedding.

1200
01:12:30,913 --> 01:12:32,744
I'm telling you,
it was so obvious.

1201
01:12:32,815 --> 01:12:35,784
Even with all this crazy shit
going on around us,
we still belong together.

1202
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:37,182
Obvious to her
or to you?

1203
01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:38,810
To both of us.

1204
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:41,846
- Oh. Oh, Paige?
- Yeah?

1205
01:12:41,957 --> 01:12:44,926
We have to start writing out
those place cards
after we eat.

1206
01:12:44,993 --> 01:12:46,324
Yes.

1207
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:48,963
Before you start on that,

1208
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:53,632
I have a little surprise
for you, Paige.

1209
01:12:54,336 --> 01:12:55,428
Oh?

1210
01:12:55,504 --> 01:12:57,267
You know Ray Porter,
right?

1211
01:12:57,339 --> 01:13:00,001
He taught constitutional law
at Northwestern.

1212
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:01,633
He and I were on
law review together.

1213
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:04,110
We've known each other
1,000 years.

1214
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:07,105
He is the dean of
the law school now.

1215
01:13:07,182 --> 01:13:08,274
Okay.

1216
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:10,045
And they're gonna
let you back in.

1217
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:11,710
What?

1218
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,287
Well...

1219
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:16,048
I didn't even apply.

1220
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:17,819
I took care of it.

1221
01:13:19,862 --> 01:13:23,025
This is crazy.

1222
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:28,332
I feel like I'm getting
a free do-over in life.

1223
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:01,792
You look like
you could use a drink.

1224
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:04,726
I've already had several.

1225
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,927
But you haven't had this.

1226
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:10,570
All right.

1227
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:14,602
I'm glad we're
having a moment alone.

1228
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:18,168
I haven't gotten a chance
to really talk to you, Leo.

1229
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:19,644
Yeah.

1230
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:21,409
Yeah, cool.

1231
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:24,078
Congratulations.

1232
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:29,784
That's nice.

1233
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:30,950
Yes, it is.

1234
01:15:33,595 --> 01:15:35,586
I've been thinking.

1235
01:15:35,664 --> 01:15:40,829
And I think that
it's probably time to
let us take it from here.

1236
01:15:40,936 --> 01:15:42,198
Take what?

1237
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:44,634
Things with Paige.

1238
01:15:45,774 --> 01:15:48,004
Look, I know she didn't have
health insurance because

1239
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:51,102
you chose to live
in a certain way,

1240
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:54,112
and I know you must
be drowning in debt.

1241
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:57,777
But I also know
a way out of this.

1242
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,010
What's that?

1243
01:16:01,156 --> 01:16:02,646
Divorce her.

1244
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:06,156
The bills have
only just begun, Leo.

1245
01:16:08,463 --> 01:16:10,522
Mr. Thornton, I don't think
this is the time

1246
01:16:10,632 --> 01:16:12,293
or the place to discuss this.

1247
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:15,359
Fine. If you don't care
about losing your business,

1248
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:18,166
which, clearly, you don't,

1249
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,400
what about Paige?

1250
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:21,135
What about doing
what is obviously

1251
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:22,471
the right thing for her?

1252
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:23,670
And you know
what's right for her?

1253
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:24,803
As a matter of fact, I do.

1254
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,072
You're such a hypocrite.

1255
01:16:27,182 --> 01:16:28,308
What did you say?

1256
01:16:28,383 --> 01:16:31,352
If you're such
a family man, how come I...

1257
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:32,751
I never once saw
you come and try

1258
01:16:32,854 --> 01:16:34,845
to put things back
together with Paige?

1259
01:16:39,661 --> 01:16:41,526
You're such a coward.

1260
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:59,874
Hey, can I introduce
you around a little bit?

1261
01:17:00,582 --> 01:17:02,277
Can't feel good to
be the odd man out.

1262
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:04,045
I'm not the odd man out.

1263
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:05,617
All right.
If you say so.

1264
01:17:05,721 --> 01:17:07,780
You just seem a little creepy
over here all by yourself.

1265
01:17:07,889 --> 01:17:09,880
I'm just waiting
for Paige, man.

1266
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:12,119
All right, well,
best of luck with that.

1267
01:17:12,227 --> 01:17:13,694
You like this, right?

1268
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:16,288
I'm sorry, like what?

1269
01:17:16,398 --> 01:17:17,922
Paige leaves you behind.

1270
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:19,864
She goes and has
this life without you,

1271
01:17:19,935 --> 01:17:21,732
with some guy
that no one gets.

1272
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:23,361
And now you get to
see her reject all that.

1273
01:17:24,206 --> 01:17:26,606
I mean, I like it
a little bit.

1274
01:17:26,775 --> 01:17:28,106
Yeah?

1275
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:30,201
Well, let me
tell you what I like.

1276
01:17:30,278 --> 01:17:31,802
I like the fact
that Paige told me

1277
01:17:31,913 --> 01:17:32,971
everything about you,
Jeremy.

1278
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:35,075
Okay.

1279
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:38,278
She told me that
when she was with you,

1280
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:41,615
she would wake up
at night in a panic,

1281
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:43,156
thinking,
"Is this all there is?"

1282
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:44,949
Wow.

1283
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:46,321
She told you
everything, huh?

1284
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:47,486
Mmm-hmm.

1285
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:48,994
Did she tell you
that she threw herself

1286
01:17:49,097 --> 01:17:50,155
at me the other day?

1287
01:17:50,265 --> 01:17:52,130
Did she tell you that?

1288
01:17:52,234 --> 01:17:54,259
Or did she stop
telling you everything

1289
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:55,928
when she forgot
who the hell you were?

1290
01:17:58,306 --> 01:18:00,274
Look, I get why
you're being such a dick.

1291
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:02,240
You obviously love her,

1292
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:03,777
and you think you're
gonna get her back.

1293
01:18:04,579 --> 01:18:07,104
But the thing is,
she outgrew you.

1294
01:18:07,649 --> 01:18:09,947
What makes you think
that won't happen again?

1295
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:12,453
Thank you for that advice.

1296
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:15,081
I will mull it over while
I'm in bed with your wife.

1297
01:18:16,825 --> 01:18:18,019
Leo!

1298
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:31,196
Paige, wait!

1299
01:18:31,306 --> 01:18:32,432
What the hell
were you thinking?

1300
01:18:32,507 --> 01:18:33,838
I don't know. That's
a really good question,

1301
01:18:33,942 --> 01:18:36,672
because I have been
driving myself insane,

1302
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:39,042
making a complete ass
of myself!

1303
01:18:39,147 --> 01:18:40,671
Literally trying
everything possible

1304
01:18:40,782 --> 01:18:42,010
to try to save
what we have.

1305
01:18:42,117 --> 01:18:44,142
And you've been
throwing yourself
at Jeremy.

1306
01:18:44,953 --> 01:18:46,147
That's not fair.

1307
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:47,347
It's not fair?

1308
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:51,790
I see the way
you look at him.

1309
01:18:53,628 --> 01:18:54,890
I know,

1310
01:18:56,131 --> 01:18:58,998
because you used to
look at me that way.

1311
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:02,962
Leo, I...

1312
01:19:03,038 --> 01:19:04,801
No, I think we need to
start being realistic.

1313
01:19:04,873 --> 01:19:06,636
Your memory's
not coming back.

1314
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:10,405
The fact is that
I'm still just a stranger.

1315
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:14,508
I'm not trying
to hurt you.

1316
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:18,344
But I'm just...

1317
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:24,658
I'm so tired of
disappointing you.

1318
01:19:26,728 --> 01:19:27,990
I know.

1319
01:19:29,731 --> 01:19:31,358
I'm so sorry.

1320
01:19:34,903 --> 01:19:37,269
I'll apologize
to Gwen and Ryan.

1321
01:19:37,372 --> 01:19:40,102
Oh, God, no, it's fine.

1322
01:19:41,576 --> 01:19:45,410
Wedding disasters
have a way of turning
into great stories.

1323
01:19:47,215 --> 01:19:48,682
Eventually.

1324
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:57,255
How do you look at
the girl you love

1325
01:19:57,359 --> 01:20:00,351
and tell yourself
it's time to walk away?

1326
01:20:10,272 --> 01:20:11,296
Leo?

1327
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:19,539
I hope one day I can love
the way that you love me.

1328
01:20:22,918 --> 01:20:24,943
You figured it out once.

1329
01:20:26,421 --> 01:20:28,389
You'll do it again.

1330
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:45,364
Shit.

1331
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:47,793
You're here, not there.

1332
01:21:48,503 --> 01:21:50,164
Are you okay?

1333
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:51,535
I'm done.

1334
01:21:51,973 --> 01:21:54,339
It's over. I give up.

1335
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:56,671
No, you never give up, Leo.

1336
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:59,179
No, if we were
meant to be together,

1337
01:21:59,247 --> 01:22:00,612
we would be together.

1338
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:04,843
I was just thinking
about the first time

1339
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,683
that we went to
that Greek restaurant

1340
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:08,245
on the corner.

1341
01:22:08,356 --> 01:22:10,290
There was
this big banner saying

1342
01:22:10,392 --> 01:22:11,791
"Now Serving Soup,"

1343
01:22:12,727 --> 01:22:14,957
and I just started to
go on and on

1344
01:22:15,063 --> 01:22:18,294
About all the obstacles

1345
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,027
that the owner
must have overcome

1346
01:22:20,101 --> 01:22:22,569
to achieve his lifelong dream
of serving soup.

1347
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:26,873
And then...
And when I was finished...

1348
01:22:28,043 --> 01:22:30,603
She didn't say anything
for a few seconds

1349
01:22:30,712 --> 01:22:31,940
and she just...

1350
01:22:34,115 --> 01:22:36,310
She just sort of exhaled it.

1351
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:40,212
It was almost to herself.

1352
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:43,314
"I love you."

1353
01:22:44,993 --> 01:22:47,086
And it just hung there.

1354
01:22:48,263 --> 01:22:49,890
It was the first time
she had said it,

1355
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:52,126
and I didn't
even wanna respond.

1356
01:22:52,233 --> 01:22:54,724
I just wanted to
keep hearing it.

1357
01:22:57,272 --> 01:22:59,797
That was two weeks
after we met.

1358
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:03,467
It only took her two weeks

1359
01:23:03,578 --> 01:23:05,773
to fall in love
with me before.

1360
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:18,588
She doesn't love me.

1361
01:24:10,745 --> 01:24:12,508
Sign here, please.

1362
01:24:49,017 --> 01:24:51,042
Come here,
little buddy.

1363
01:24:59,894 --> 01:25:01,020
Diane?

1364
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:03,189
Hey.

1365
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:06,093
How are you?
Listen...

1366
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:10,966
I know it's been years.

1367
01:25:11,072 --> 01:25:13,540
I was away for a while.

1368
01:25:14,242 --> 01:25:16,972
I never had a chance
to apologize.

1369
01:25:17,879 --> 01:25:20,746
I was just going through
a really weird time,

1370
01:25:20,882 --> 01:25:23,749
but your dad ended it

1371
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:27,880
as soon as your mother
confronted him about us.

1372
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:30,891
And I just always
wanted you to know that.

1373
01:25:31,392 --> 01:25:33,952
I don't mean to
open old wounds, but...

1374
01:25:34,062 --> 01:25:37,828
I just really needed
to say that I'm sorry.

1375
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:41,994
No, I'm really glad
that you said something.

1376
01:25:42,103 --> 01:25:44,799
You were always
a really good friend.

1377
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:47,601
I just wish I could've
returned the favor.

1378
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:51,639
The lilies were bad,
so I got sunflowers instead.

1379
01:26:02,457 --> 01:26:03,651
I wanted to tell you.

1380
01:26:03,758 --> 01:26:04,850
You knew?

1381
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:08,095
You knew the whole time?

1382
01:26:09,631 --> 01:26:11,462
I'm sorry.
Don't talk to me.

1383
01:26:11,533 --> 01:26:14,502
Paige. Paige. Paige!

1384
01:26:18,039 --> 01:26:20,269
Hey, where have you
been all day, stranger?

1385
01:26:20,975 --> 01:26:22,340
Hmm?

1386
01:26:22,644 --> 01:26:23,838
Paige?

1387
01:26:25,947 --> 01:26:27,676
I ran into Diane Chain
at the store.

1388
01:26:30,285 --> 01:26:33,721
That's why I left, isn't it?
Because I found out.

1389
01:26:35,723 --> 01:26:39,056
Mom, I barely
even know who I am,

1390
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:41,526
and then it turns out
you're lying to me,

1391
01:26:41,629 --> 01:26:45,065
and you've used my accident
to rewrite the past?

1392
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:49,696
I couldn't bear the thought
of losing you again.

1393
01:26:50,638 --> 01:26:54,301
Do you have any idea
how betrayed I feel
right now?

1394
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:56,366
I'm sorry, Paige.

1395
01:26:56,477 --> 01:26:58,707
We were happier than
we'd been in years.

1396
01:26:58,813 --> 01:27:00,007
Oh, Mom!

1397
01:27:00,081 --> 01:27:01,673
We finally
had you back again.

1398
01:27:01,749 --> 01:27:03,011
Back on your terms!

1399
01:27:03,084 --> 01:27:04,244
No!

1400
01:27:04,352 --> 01:27:06,513
Yes, as usual!
Paige!

1401
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:09,716
He cheated on you
with my friend!

1402
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:13,156
How could you
stay with him?

1403
01:27:14,529 --> 01:27:15,655
I...

1404
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,326
I was going to leave.

1405
01:27:22,604 --> 01:27:24,663
I was.
I was all ready to leave.

1406
01:27:25,373 --> 01:27:29,673
And then one afternoon,
I was all alone
in the house,

1407
01:27:30,678 --> 01:27:35,240
and I started looking at
all the photographs of you

1408
01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:37,577
and your...

1409
01:27:39,721 --> 01:27:41,518
And your sister.

1410
01:27:42,223 --> 01:27:46,683
And the house seemed
so full of all of us.

1411
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:51,125
We were a family, Paige.

1412
01:27:52,734 --> 01:27:55,396
And I realized
in that moment that

1413
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:59,733
that was
the most important thing
in the world for me.

1414
01:28:00,141 --> 01:28:02,974
And I couldn't,
I couldn't,

1415
01:28:03,711 --> 01:28:06,271
I could not go.

1416
01:28:08,716 --> 01:28:10,946
So, you just
WASPed it away?

1417
01:28:11,452 --> 01:28:12,544
No.

1418
01:28:13,488 --> 01:28:16,924
I chose to stay with him

1419
01:28:18,092 --> 01:28:21,220
for all the things
that he had done right

1420
01:28:22,897 --> 01:28:26,890
and not to leave him
for the one thing
that he had done wrong.

1421
01:28:30,405 --> 01:28:32,430
I chose to forgive him.

1422
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:40,178
Maybe Leo was right.

1423
01:28:41,349 --> 01:28:45,945
Maybe I can't
figure out who I am
and be around all of you.

1424
01:29:00,668 --> 01:29:03,004
I still feel
a little chilly. I don't
care what you say.

1425
01:29:04,372 --> 01:29:05,839
That's fine.

1426
01:29:08,209 --> 01:29:09,301
Paige.

1427
01:29:17,218 --> 01:29:18,446
I'm sorry.

1428
01:29:18,519 --> 01:29:19,645
Is everything okay?

1429
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:26,050
Look, you two
obviously need to talk,
so I'm just...

1430
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:27,650
Okay.
Talk to you later.

1431
01:29:27,729 --> 01:29:29,356
All right, bye.

1432
01:29:31,999 --> 01:29:33,728
I'm... I'm sorry.

1433
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:37,295
What happened?

1434
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:41,136
Can I ask you something?

1435
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:42,403
Yeah.

1436
01:29:43,478 --> 01:29:45,844
You can always
ask me anything.

1437
01:29:46,514 --> 01:29:49,142
Did you know
about my dad's affair?

1438
01:29:50,485 --> 01:29:51,679
Yeah.

1439
01:29:52,353 --> 01:29:53,650
I knew.

1440
01:30:00,027 --> 01:30:01,688
Why didn't you tell me?

1441
01:30:08,936 --> 01:30:12,394
There were so many times
that I almost did.

1442
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:18,170
But to drive you away
from your family again?

1443
01:30:18,913 --> 01:30:20,540
That just felt wrong.

1444
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:24,517
I wanted your love, I...

1445
01:30:24,585 --> 01:30:26,416
Just not like that.

1446
01:30:27,688 --> 01:30:29,553
I wanted to earn it.

1447
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:49,069
I just don't think
I can afford to
lose them right now.

1448
01:30:51,913 --> 01:30:53,312
So don't.

1449
01:31:01,322 --> 01:31:04,723
Certain parties
have sought to nullify
various congressional acts,

1450
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:07,625
claiming that
repeated extensions
of copyright protection

1451
01:31:07,728 --> 01:31:09,821
constitute
a perpetual copyright

1452
01:31:09,931 --> 01:31:13,924
of the sort the drafters
of the Constitution
would have rejected.

1453
01:31:14,001 --> 01:31:15,491
The United States
Supreme Court,

1454
01:31:15,603 --> 01:31:18,731
in the 2003 case
of <i>Eldred v. Ashcroft...</i>

1455
01:31:26,447 --> 01:31:27,812
Thanks for lunch.

1456
01:31:27,915 --> 01:31:31,476
Actually, there's something
that I wanted to tell you.

1457
01:31:31,586 --> 01:31:32,746
Okay.

1458
01:31:33,654 --> 01:31:36,122
Things are over
with Rose.

1459
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:39,122
I ended it, Paige.

1460
01:31:39,927 --> 01:31:42,691
No. Why did you do that?

1461
01:31:42,797 --> 01:31:44,594
I thought you were
getting engaged...

1462
01:31:44,665 --> 01:31:46,257
We were,
but that was before you.

1463
01:31:46,334 --> 01:31:47,801
No, that was after me.

1464
01:31:47,869 --> 01:31:50,030
Okay, it was after you,
but it was before this you.

1465
01:31:50,137 --> 01:31:52,002
It was before
the old you came back.

1466
01:31:54,008 --> 01:31:56,169
Jeremy, I'm not the old me.

1467
01:31:57,278 --> 01:31:58,870
I'm just me.

1468
01:31:59,347 --> 01:32:02,544
I'm just the me that's trying
to figure it out still.

1469
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:04,781
I understand,
but, whichever it is,

1470
01:32:04,852 --> 01:32:07,787
the old you or the new you,
I don't care.

1471
01:32:09,490 --> 01:32:10,787
I know you remember
what we were like together.

1472
01:32:10,858 --> 01:32:11,950
I know you do.

1473
01:32:12,026 --> 01:32:13,493
This is our chance
to get that back.

1474
01:32:13,661 --> 01:32:15,151
What we had was wonderful.

1475
01:32:15,229 --> 01:32:17,789
Those were wonderful memories,
but those were...

1476
01:32:17,865 --> 01:32:19,958
Those are my only memories.

1477
01:32:20,034 --> 01:32:22,400
Everything
after you is erased.

1478
01:32:23,304 --> 01:32:24,532
I...

1479
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:31,573
I have to discover
what it's like to be
without you, on my own.

1480
01:32:34,081 --> 01:32:35,207
Are you sure
you don't remember

1481
01:32:35,316 --> 01:32:37,011
breaking up with me
the first time?

1482
01:32:37,852 --> 01:32:39,251
Why?

1483
01:32:39,353 --> 01:32:41,651
'Cause it sounded
a hell of a lot like that.

1484
01:32:45,927 --> 01:32:47,326
Let's go.

1485
01:32:58,072 --> 01:33:00,836
Hey.
I was looking all over.

1486
01:33:00,908 --> 01:33:04,776
I was worried
when I didn't see you
outside the library.

1487
01:33:07,348 --> 01:33:08,610
So...

1488
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:14,616
How's that intellectual
property class going?

1489
01:33:20,194 --> 01:33:23,095
Actually, I wanna
talk to you about that.

1490
01:33:23,798 --> 01:33:26,767
I've decided to
leave law school.

1491
01:33:28,736 --> 01:33:30,863
And I'm gonna get
an apartment in the city.

1492
01:33:31,772 --> 01:33:34,263
It's happening
all over again, isn't it?

1493
01:33:34,375 --> 01:33:36,070
Damn it, Paige.

1494
01:33:37,545 --> 01:33:39,103
I've made a lot
of mistakes.

1495
01:33:39,914 --> 01:33:44,112
Dad, this isn't about you
or anything you've done.

1496
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:48,985
This is about me,
who I want to be, who I am.

1497
01:33:50,224 --> 01:33:54,888
Just tell me what to say,
so I don't lose you again.

1498
01:33:58,232 --> 01:33:59,824
You won't.

1499
01:34:07,942 --> 01:34:10,103
<i>A moment of impact.</i>

1500
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:20,450
<i>A moment of impact
whose potential for change</i>

1501
01:34:20,521 --> 01:34:23,979
<i>has ripple effects
far beyond what
we can predict,</i>

1502
01:34:27,194 --> 01:34:30,095
<i>sending some particles
crashing together</i>

1503
01:34:32,266 --> 01:34:34,632
<i>making them
closer than before,</i>

1504
01:34:41,142 --> 01:34:44,373
<i>while sending
others spinning off
into great ventures</i>

1505
01:34:47,314 --> 01:34:50,545
<i>landing where
you never thought
you'd find them.</i>

1506
01:34:54,121 --> 01:34:57,522
<i>You see, that's the thing
about moments like these.</i>

1507
01:34:58,392 --> 01:35:00,053
<i>You can't,</i>

1508
01:35:00,895 --> 01:35:03,159
<i>no matter how hard you try,</i>

1509
01:35:03,898 --> 01:35:06,628
<i>control how
they're gonna affect you.</i>

1510
01:35:08,469 --> 01:35:12,132
<i>You just gotta let
the colliding particles
land where they may</i>

1511
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:17,236
<i>and wait until
the next collision.</i>

1512
01:35:25,186 --> 01:35:28,155
<i>I vow to
help you love life,</i>

1513
01:35:28,222 --> 01:35:30,588
<i>to always hold you
with tenderness,</i>

1514
01:35:30,691 --> 01:35:33,558
<i>and to have the patience
that love demands.</i>

1515
01:35:33,661 --> 01:35:35,754
<i>To speak when
words are needed</i>

1516
01:35:35,863 --> 01:35:38,525
<i>and to share the silence
when they're not.</i>

1517
01:35:38,599 --> 01:35:42,160
<i>To agree to disagree
on red velvet cake.</i>

1518
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:45,168
<i>And to live within
the warmth of your heart</i>

1519
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:46,866
<i>and always call it home.</i>

1520
01:36:33,154 --> 01:36:34,246
Hi.

1521
01:36:37,224 --> 01:36:38,623
Hi.

1522
01:36:42,062 --> 01:36:43,825
I hope you didn't
come all the way

1523
01:36:43,931 --> 01:36:45,296
into the city
for hot chocolate.

1524
01:36:45,399 --> 01:36:49,096
Actually, I moved
back here six months ago.

1525
01:36:49,170 --> 01:36:51,263
I'm over in Rogers Park.

1526
01:36:52,072 --> 01:36:55,098
Really? That...
That's great.

1527
01:36:55,176 --> 01:36:57,610
I'm actually back
at the Art Institute.

1528
01:36:57,678 --> 01:36:59,236
What?
Are you kidding me?

1529
01:36:59,413 --> 01:37:00,471
Mmm-mmm.

1530
01:37:00,581 --> 01:37:01,741
That's amazing.

1531
01:37:01,816 --> 01:37:04,751
Yeah. I mean,
I'm sitting in
on a few classes,

1532
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:09,187
and it's crazy
what my hands remember

1533
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:12,259
that my, you know,
that my mind forgot.

1534
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:14,691
Yeah.

1535
01:37:16,130 --> 01:37:17,825
So, thank you.

1536
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:20,967
I didn't do anything.

1537
01:37:21,035 --> 01:37:22,866
You did everything.

1538
01:37:24,271 --> 01:37:27,536
You accepted me for who I am,

1539
01:37:28,342 --> 01:37:31,140
and not for
what you wanted me to be.

1540
01:37:34,815 --> 01:37:37,147
I just wanted you
to be happy.

1541
01:37:39,153 --> 01:37:40,620
That's all.

1542
01:37:48,128 --> 01:37:51,188
Isn't there some
Cuban place around here

1543
01:37:51,298 --> 01:37:55,132
where we used to go
when this place was closed?

1544
01:37:56,871 --> 01:37:59,863
Yeah. It's... Wait.
You remember?

1545
01:38:00,741 --> 01:38:01,901
No, no.

1546
01:38:03,377 --> 01:38:04,708
I wish.

1547
01:38:05,145 --> 01:38:09,172
No, the memory stuff
hasn't come back, but I've...

1548
01:38:10,851 --> 01:38:13,046
Sonia and I have been
hanging out a little bit,

1549
01:38:13,153 --> 01:38:16,987
and I've been
asking her about us.

1550
01:38:18,726 --> 01:38:21,354
Really?
And what has she been saying?

1551
01:38:23,831 --> 01:38:25,765
That she doesn't think you're

1552
01:38:25,866 --> 01:38:27,561
seeing anyone right now.

1553
01:38:31,038 --> 01:38:33,233
She just happens
to be right.

1554
01:38:35,709 --> 01:38:39,110
You? Are you seeing anyone?

1555
01:38:44,585 --> 01:38:46,280
That's good.

1556
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:50,417
So, do you wanna go
to the Cuban place?

1557
01:38:51,358 --> 01:38:52,723
With me?

1558
01:38:54,395 --> 01:38:55,885
Okay.

1559
01:38:56,563 --> 01:38:57,928
Okay.

1560
01:39:01,568 --> 01:39:03,035
What would you say
to trying someplace

1561
01:39:03,103 --> 01:39:04,934
that we haven't
been to before?

1562
01:39:05,039 --> 01:39:06,734
Someplace new?

1563
01:39:07,641 --> 01:39:09,302
I'd like that.

1564
01:39:09,710 --> 01:39:11,109
After you.

1565
01:39:16,917 --> 01:39:22,219
* <i>I've been looking so long
at these pictures of you</i>

1566
01:39:22,589 --> 01:39:27,083
* <i>That I almost believe
that they're real</i>

1567
01:39:28,295 --> 01:39:33,733
* <i>I've been living so long
with my pictures of you</i>

1568
01:39:33,801 --> 01:39:36,133
* <i>That I almost believe</i>

1569
01:39:36,236 --> 01:39:38,796
* <i>That the pictures are</i>

1570
01:39:38,906 --> 01:39:41,340
* <i>All I can feel</i>

1571
01:40:01,962 --> 01:40:07,298
* <i>Remembering you
standing quiet in the rain</i>

1572
01:40:07,368 --> 01:40:11,464
* <i>As I ran to your heart
to be near</i>

1573
01:40:12,973 --> 01:40:16,374
* <i>And we kissed
as the sky fell in</i>

1574
01:40:16,477 --> 01:40:18,468
* <i>Holding you close</i>

1575
01:40:18,545 --> 01:40:22,709
* <i>How I always held close
in your fear</i>

1576
01:40:24,351 --> 01:40:29,448
* <i>Remembering you
running soft through the night</i>

1577
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:35,492
* <i>You were bigger and brighter
and wider than snow</i>

1578
01:40:35,562 --> 01:40:38,554
* <i>And screamed
at the make-believe</i>

1579
01:40:38,665 --> 01:40:40,826
* <i>Screamed at the sky</i>

1580
01:40:40,901 --> 01:40:44,894
* <i>And you finally found
all your courage</i>

1581
01:40:45,005 --> 01:40:47,838
* <i>To let it all go</i>

1582
01:40:57,885 --> 01:41:03,846
* <i>Remembering you
fallen into my arms</i>

1583
01:41:03,924 --> 01:41:07,257
* <i>Crying for the death
of your heart</i>

1584
01:41:08,829 --> 01:41:12,196
* <i>You were stone white
So delicate</i>

1585
01:41:12,266 --> 01:41:14,325
* <i>Lost in the cold</i>

1586
01:41:14,401 --> 01:41:18,360
* <i>You were always
so lost in the dark</i>

1587
01:41:20,207 --> 01:41:25,611
* <i>Remembering you
how you used to be</i>

1588
01:41:25,712 --> 01:41:28,545
* <i>Slow drowned
You were angels</i>

1589
01:41:28,615 --> 01:41:31,607
* <i>So much more
than everything</i>

1590
01:41:31,852 --> 01:41:37,256
* <i>Hold for the last time
then slip away quietly</i>

1591
01:41:37,357 --> 01:41:42,886
* <i>Open my eyes
But I never see anything</i>

1592
01:41:42,963 --> 01:41:47,263
* <i>If only I'd thought
of the right words</i>

1593
01:41:48,135 --> 01:41:51,901
* <i>I could have held on
to your heart</i>

1594
01:41:53,774 --> 01:41:58,370
* <i>If only I'd thought
of the right words</i>

1595
01:41:59,413 --> 01:42:03,144
* <i>I wouldn't be
breaking apart</i>

1596
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:06,151
* <i>All my pictures of you</i>

1597
01:42:16,497 --> 01:42:20,991
* <i>Looking so long
at these pictures of you</i>

1598
01:42:21,969 --> 01:42:25,405
* <i>But I never hold on
to your heart</i>

1599
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:03,036
* <i>There was nothing
in the world</i>

1600
01:43:03,143 --> 01:43:06,135
* <i>That I ever wanted more</i>

1601
01:43:06,213 --> 01:43:10,115
* <i>Than to feel you
deep in my heart</i>

1602
01:43:11,652 --> 01:43:14,382
* <i>There was nothing
in the world</i>

1603
01:43:14,488 --> 01:43:16,979
* <i>That I ever wanted more</i>

1604
01:43:17,224 --> 01:43:21,354
* <i>Than to never feel
the breaking apart</i>

1605
01:43:21,628 --> 01:43:23,994
* <i>My pictures of you</i> *
