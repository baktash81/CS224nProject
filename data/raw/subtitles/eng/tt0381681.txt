Woman:
do you consider the book

21
00:01:49,773 --> 00:01:51,608
To be autobiographical?

22
00:01:51,642 --> 00:01:55,011
Mm-hmm. Um, well, I mean...

23
00:01:55,045 --> 00:01:56,846
Isn't everything
autobiographical?

24
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,982
I mean, we all see the world

25
00:01:59,016 --> 00:02:03,019
Through our own...
Tiny keyhole, right?

26
00:02:03,053 --> 00:02:04,921
I mean, I always think
of thomas wolfe.

27
00:02:04,955 --> 00:02:06,656
You know, have you
ever seen that--

28
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,257
That little one-page
"note to reader"

29
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:09,692
<i>In the front of
look homeward, angel.</i>

30
00:02:09,727 --> 00:02:10,693
Right? You know
what'm talking about?

31
00:02:10,728 --> 00:02:12,829
Anyway, h-he says that

32
00:02:12,896 --> 00:02:16,332
We are the sum
of all the moments of our lives,

33
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:18,334
And that anybody
who sits down to write

34
00:02:18,335 --> 00:02:20,136
Is gonna use the clay
of their own life,

35
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,772
That you can't avoid that.

36
00:02:22,806 --> 00:02:24,841
So when I look at my own life,
you know,

37
00:02:24,842 --> 00:02:27,343
I have to admit, right,
that I've--

38
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:30,747
I've never been around
a bunch of guns, or violence,

39
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:32,415
You know, not really.

40
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:36,019
No...Political intrigue,
or helicopter crash, right,

41
00:02:36,086 --> 00:02:37,620
But my life,

42
00:02:37,655 --> 00:02:40,723
From my own point of view,
has been full of drama, right?

43
00:02:40,758 --> 00:02:44,761
And, uh, so I thought
if I could write a book that...

44
00:02:44,795 --> 00:02:46,329
That could capture
what it's like

45
00:02:46,363 --> 00:02:47,930
To really meet somebody.

46
00:02:47,965 --> 00:02:49,699
<i>I mean, one of the most
exciting things</i>

47
00:02:49,733 --> 00:02:50,967
<i>That's ever
happened to me, right,</i>

48
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:53,870
<i>Is to really meet somebody,</i>

49
00:02:53,904 --> 00:02:55,905
<i>Make that connection,
and if I could...</i>

50
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,074
Make that valuable,
you know, to capture that,

51
00:02:58,108 --> 00:03:02,278
<i>That would be
the attempt, or...</i>

52
00:03:02,313 --> 00:03:05,014
<i>Did I answer your question?
I...</i>

53
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:07,083
I'll try to be more specific.

54
00:03:07,117 --> 00:03:08,584
Okay.
Okay.

55
00:03:08,619 --> 00:03:10,520
Were there ever
a french young woman on a train,

56
00:03:10,554 --> 00:03:12,922
You met
and spent an evening with?

57
00:03:12,957 --> 00:03:15,425
Ahhh...

58
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:16,893
Um...

59
00:03:16,927 --> 00:03:19,262
<i>See, to me, that...</i>

60
00:03:19,296 --> 00:03:20,563
<i>I mean, uh...</i>

61
00:03:20,597 --> 00:03:22,498
<i>That's not important,
you know?</i>

62
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:24,067
<i>Woman:
so that's a yes.</i>

63
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:25,969
<i>All right,
since I'm in France,</i>

64
00:03:26,003 --> 00:03:27,403
<i>And this is the last stop
of my book tour,</i>

65
00:03:27,438 --> 00:03:29,038
Yes.

66
00:03:29,073 --> 00:03:30,239
[crowd laughing]

67
00:03:30,274 --> 00:03:31,941
Thank you.

68
00:03:31,976 --> 00:03:33,176
Mr. Wallace, um,

69
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,445
The book ends
on an ambiguous note.

70
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,746
We don't know.

71
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,681
D-do you think they get
back together

72
00:03:38,716 --> 00:03:39,782
<i>In six months</i>

73
00:03:39,817 --> 00:03:41,851
<i>Like they promise each other?</i>

74
00:03:43,587 --> 00:03:46,990
<i>Jesse:
like they promised? Um...</i>

75
00:03:47,024 --> 00:03:48,858
<i>I think I answered that.</i>

76
00:03:48,892 --> 00:03:50,193
<i>You know? It's a--</i>

77
00:03:50,227 --> 00:03:52,095
<i>It's a good test, right,</i>

78
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:54,030
If you're a romantic
or a cynic.

79
00:03:54,064 --> 00:03:55,531
Right? I mean,

80
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:58,501
You think-- you think
they get back together, right?

81
00:03:58,535 --> 00:04:00,236
You don't, for sure.
No.

82
00:04:00,271 --> 00:04:02,171
And you hope they do,
but, you know, you're not sure.

83
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:04,007
That's why you're
asking the question.

84
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,942
And-- and do you think
they get back together?

85
00:04:05,976 --> 00:04:08,511
I mean, did you
in real life?

86
00:04:08,545 --> 00:04:09,545
[sighs]

87
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,613
Did I in real--?

[man laughs]

89
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:14,484
Look, in the words
of my grandfather, okay,

90
00:04:14,518 --> 00:04:15,952
"to answer that...

91
00:04:15,986 --> 00:04:18,054
Would take the piss
out of the whole thing."

92
00:04:18,088 --> 00:04:19,289
Oh, no.
[speaks french]

93
00:04:19,323 --> 00:04:20,390
We just have
the time

94
00:04:20,424 --> 00:04:21,391
For one last question, hmm?

95
00:04:21,425 --> 00:04:22,458
What--?

96
00:04:22,493 --> 00:04:24,227
What is your next book?

97
00:04:24,762 --> 00:04:25,995
Uh...

98
00:04:26,697 --> 00:04:27,797
I don't know, man.

99
00:04:27,831 --> 00:04:29,499
I don't know.

100
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:31,000
I've been...

101
00:04:31,035 --> 00:04:33,202
I've been thinking about this--

102
00:04:33,237 --> 00:04:35,972
Well, I always
kind of wanted to write a book

103
00:04:36,006 --> 00:04:39,609
That all took place
within the space of a pop song.

104
00:04:39,643 --> 00:04:41,611
You know,
like three or four minutes long,

105
00:04:41,645 --> 00:04:43,246
The whole thing.

106
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,915
The story, the idea,
is that there's this guy,

107
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,718
All right, and...

108
00:04:48,752 --> 00:04:49,819
He's totally depressed.

109
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,054
I mean, his great dream

110
00:04:51,088 --> 00:04:53,623
Was to be a lover,
an adventurer,

111
00:04:53,657 --> 00:04:56,559
You know, riding motorcycles
through south america,

112
00:04:56,593 --> 00:05:00,163
And instead, he's sitting at
a marble table, eating lobster,

113
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,432
And he's got a good job
and a beautiful wife, right.

114
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:04,767
But-- you know,
everything that he needs...

115
00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:06,836
But that d-- doesn't matter,

116
00:05:06,837 --> 00:05:08,271
Because what he wants...

117
00:05:08,305 --> 00:05:10,607
Is to fight for meaning,
you know?

118
00:05:10,608 --> 00:05:12,642
I mean, happiness
is in the doing, right?

119
00:05:12,676 --> 00:05:15,111
Not in the getting
what you want.

120
00:05:15,145 --> 00:05:17,080
So he's sitting there,

121
00:05:17,114 --> 00:05:18,848
And just that second,

122
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:23,086
His little 5-year-old daughter
hops up on the table,

123
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,021
And he knows
that she should get down,

124
00:05:25,089 --> 00:05:26,556
Because she could get hurt.

125
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,859
But she's dancing
to this pop song

126
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:31,661
In a summer dress,

127
00:05:31,695 --> 00:05:33,429
<i>And he looks down,</i>

128
00:05:33,464 --> 00:05:35,031
<i>And all of a sudden,</i>

129
00:05:35,032 --> 00:05:36,966
<i>He's 16...</i>

130
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:43,106
And his high-school sweetheart
is dropping him off at home.

131
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,041
And they just lost
their virginity,

132
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:46,809
And she loves him,

133
00:05:46,844 --> 00:05:51,047
And the same song
is playing on the car radio.

134
00:05:51,048 --> 00:05:52,482
And she climbs up

135
00:05:52,516 --> 00:05:54,050
And starts dancing
on the roof of the car,

136
00:05:54,118 --> 00:05:55,718
And now-- now
he's worried about her.

137
00:05:55,786 --> 00:05:57,720
And she's beautiful, with a...

138
00:05:57,788 --> 00:06:00,556
A facial expression, you know,
just like his daughter's.

139
00:06:00,624 --> 00:06:03,059
<i>In fact, you know, maybe
that's why he even likes her.</i>

140
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,727
<i>You know, I mean, see...</i>

141
00:06:04,728 --> 00:06:06,296
<i>He knows he's not
remembering this dance.</i>

142
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,630
<i>He's there.
He's there in--</i>

143
00:06:07,665 --> 00:06:09,399
<i>In both moments,
simultaneously,</i>

144
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,468
And just, like, for an instant,
all his life is just

145
00:06:12,503 --> 00:06:14,003
Folding in on itself,

146
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:16,706
And it's obvious
to him that time is a lie.

147
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,741
Uh...

148
00:06:18,742 --> 00:06:20,910
That it's all happening
all the time,

149
00:06:20,978 --> 00:06:24,914
And inside every moment
is another moment, all...

150
00:06:24,982 --> 00:06:27,016
You know,
happening simultaneously.

151
00:06:27,051 --> 00:06:29,018
And, anyway, that's--
that's kind of the idea.

152
00:06:29,053 --> 00:06:30,253
Anyway.

153
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:32,588
Well, our author

180
00:07:26,877 --> 00:07:28,511
But, um, I mean,
I have a little time.

181
00:07:28,545 --> 00:07:29,579
Okay.

182
00:07:29,613 --> 00:07:30,813
Yeah? All right,
well, let me...

183
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:34,284
I'll meet you outside. Okay.

184
00:07:35,152 --> 00:07:36,686
Jesse:
excuse me.

185
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,554
I'm just gonna go out
and get a cup of coffee.

186
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:40,757
I'll be back at 7:15.
Did you sign all these?

187
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,158
Um, yeah, I sure did.

188
00:07:42,192 --> 00:07:43,660
Well, get your
driver philippe's card

189
00:07:43,694 --> 00:07:44,861
So that you can
call his cell phone

190
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,462
If you're running late.
All right.

191
00:07:46,497 --> 00:07:47,730
And we'll put
your bags in the car

192
00:07:47,765 --> 00:07:49,365
So you're not late
going to the airport.

193
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
All right,
thanks for everything.

194
00:07:50,434 --> 00:07:51,301
Thank you.

195
00:07:51,335 --> 00:07:52,936
<i>Merci beaucoup, mademoiselle.</i>

196
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,037
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

197
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:55,171
Which one's philippe?

198
00:07:55,205 --> 00:07:57,540
[manager speaking french]

199
00:08:13,023 --> 00:08:14,223
I--
[laughs]

200
00:08:14,258 --> 00:08:15,525
I can't believe
you're here.

201
00:08:15,592 --> 00:08:16,726
Well, I live here
in paris.

202
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,528
Wow. Um...

203
00:08:18,562 --> 00:08:20,330
Are you sure
you don't have to stay?

204
00:08:20,364 --> 00:08:21,864
You're not supposed
to talk some more?

205
00:08:21,932 --> 00:08:23,366
No, no. They're sick of me.

206
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:24,634
I spent the night here
last night.

207
00:08:24,668 --> 00:08:25,868
Oh, you did?
Yeah, yeah.

208
00:08:25,936 --> 00:08:26,869
They got a loft
upstairs.

209
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,271
Oh, wow.

210
00:08:28,305 --> 00:08:29,973
Anyway, how are you?
This is so weird.

211
00:08:29,974 --> 00:08:31,341
I'm fine. It's...
[laughs]

212
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,875
It's good
to see you.

213
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,644
It's good to see you.

214
00:08:36,814 --> 00:08:39,449
So, you want to go to a café?
Uh, yeah.

215
00:08:39,483 --> 00:08:41,017
Okay. There's one
a little further...

216
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:42,552
Okay.
That I like.

217
00:08:42,586 --> 00:08:44,220
I thought I was gonna
totally lose it in there

218
00:08:44,254 --> 00:08:46,089
When I first saw you. I--

219
00:08:46,123 --> 00:08:48,291
I mean, how'd you even
know I was gonna be here?

220
00:08:48,325 --> 00:08:50,360
Well, it's my favorite
bookstore in paris.

221
00:08:50,394 --> 00:08:52,328
I-- you can sit down for hours
and read. I love it.

222
00:08:52,363 --> 00:08:54,130
[accordion playing
romantic music]

223
00:08:54,164 --> 00:08:55,531
There's fleas, but, you know.
I know, I know.

224
00:08:55,566 --> 00:08:57,367
I think a cat slept
on my head lasnight.

225
00:08:57,401 --> 00:08:58,968
So I saw your picture
on the calendar

226
00:08:59,003 --> 00:09:00,536
About a month ago,
yeah.

227
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:02,405
And that you were
going to be here.

228
00:09:02,406 --> 00:09:04,707
It's funny, because I read
an article on your book,

229
00:09:04,742 --> 00:09:05,975
Uh-huh.
And...

230
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,277
It sounded
vaguely familiar.

231
00:09:07,311 --> 00:09:08,745
Vaguely? Yeah.
Yes.

232
00:09:08,746 --> 00:09:10,079
[chuckles]
[laughs]

233
00:09:10,114 --> 00:09:11,414
But I didn't put it
all together

234
00:09:11,415 --> 00:09:13,950
Until I saw
your photo, so...

235
00:09:13,984 --> 00:09:15,952
Did you...Have
a chance to read it?

236
00:09:15,986 --> 00:09:17,787
Yes, I, um...

237
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:19,389
I was really,
really surprised,

238
00:09:19,423 --> 00:09:21,257
As you can imagine.
I mean...

239
00:09:21,258 --> 00:09:22,992
I had to read it
twice, actually.

240
00:09:23,027 --> 00:09:24,060
Yeah?

241
00:09:24,094 --> 00:09:25,395
Yeah.

242
00:09:25,429 --> 00:09:26,896
<i>Comme ci comme ça?</i>

243
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,031
No, I liked it!
Yeah?

244
00:09:28,065 --> 00:09:29,198
It's very romantic.

245
00:09:29,233 --> 00:09:30,633
I usually
don't like that,

246
00:09:30,668 --> 00:09:32,135
But it's really
well-written.

247
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:33,836
It's really well-written.
No, no. All right.

248
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:34,871
No, I really--
congratulations.

249
00:09:34,905 --> 00:09:35,872
Thank you. Thank you.

250
00:09:35,906 --> 00:09:37,674
Wait.
What?

251
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,943
Before we go anywhere,
I have, um...

252
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,245
I have to ask you...

253
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,347
Sure, what?

254
00:09:44,381 --> 00:09:47,583
Did you show up in vienna
that December?

255
00:09:47,618 --> 00:09:48,618
Oh...

256
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:50,086
Uh... Did you?

257
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,956
No, I couldn't,
but did you?

258
00:09:52,957 --> 00:09:55,024
I need to know.
It's important to me.

259
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:57,260
Why, if you didn't?

260
00:09:57,294 --> 00:09:59,529
Well, did you?

261
00:09:59,563 --> 00:10:01,364
No.

262
00:10:01,398 --> 00:10:02,465
Oh!

263
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:04,067
Oh, thank god,
you didn't.

264
00:10:04,101 --> 00:10:05,735
Well, thank god, you didn't.
Oh, my god.

265
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:07,637
I mean, thank god,
I didn't, and you didn't.

266
00:10:07,705 --> 00:10:09,539
If only one of us
had showed up there, alone,

267
00:10:09,573 --> 00:10:11,274
I know.
Then that would've sucked.

268
00:10:11,308 --> 00:10:12,642
I know. I was
so concerned with that.

269
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,977
I always felt horrible
about not being there,

270
00:10:14,044 --> 00:10:15,445
But I couldn't.

271
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:17,213
You know, my grandma
died a few days before,

272
00:10:17,247 --> 00:10:18,881
And she was buried
that day, December 16th.

273
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,283
That day.
She died, the one in budapest?

274
00:10:20,317 --> 00:10:21,918
Yes. You remember that?

275
00:10:21,952 --> 00:10:23,319
Yeah, I remember
everything.

276
00:10:23,387 --> 00:10:24,320
Of course,
it was in your book.

277
00:10:24,388 --> 00:10:25,655
I know, so...

278
00:10:25,723 --> 00:10:27,256
But anyway, I was about
to fly to vienna,

279
00:10:27,257 --> 00:10:28,491
You know, and I--

280
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:30,293
And we heard
the news about her,

281
00:10:30,327 --> 00:10:32,295
And, of course, I had
to go to the funeral

282
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:33,663
With my parents.
Yeah, well,

283
00:10:33,664 --> 00:10:34,330
I'm sorry
to hear that.

284
00:10:34,331 --> 00:10:35,999
I know...

285
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,234
But you weren't
there, anyway.

286
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:39,636
Wait.

287
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,170
Why weren't you there?

288
00:10:41,238 --> 00:10:42,605
I would've been there
if I could've.

289
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,606
I made plans and...

290
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:44,674
Wait.

291
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,476
You better have
a good reason.

292
00:10:46,977 --> 00:10:48,878
What?

293
00:10:50,881 --> 00:10:52,515
Oh. No.

294
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:55,051
No, you were there,
weren't you?

295
00:10:55,085 --> 00:10:56,085
Oh, no.

296
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,887
[laughing]
oh, that's terrible!

297
00:10:57,921 --> 00:10:59,756
I know I'm laughing,
but I don't mean it.

298
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,658
Did you hate me?
You must've hated me.

299
00:11:01,692 --> 00:11:03,493
Have you been hating me
all this time? You have.

300
00:11:03,527 --> 00:11:05,161
No.
Yes, you have.

301
00:11:05,195 --> 00:11:06,863
No, no.
Oh, but you can't hate me now, right?

302
00:11:06,864 --> 00:11:08,364
I don't--
my grandma--

303
00:11:08,432 --> 00:11:09,666
I don't hate you,
all right? Come on.

304
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,034
It's no big deal,
all right?

305
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:12,201
I flew all the way
over there.

306
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:13,703
You blew the thing off,

307
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:15,305
And my life's been
a big nosedive since then,

308
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:16,906
But I mean,
it's not a problem.

309
00:11:16,941 --> 00:11:18,207
You can't say that.
I'm kidding.

310
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:19,642
Oh, I can't
believe it!

311
00:11:19,677 --> 00:11:21,411
You must have been
so angry with me.

312
00:11:21,445 --> 00:11:22,812
I'm so sorry.

313
00:11:22,846 --> 00:11:24,380
I really wanted
to be there

314
00:11:24,381 --> 00:11:25,648
More than anything
in the world.

315
00:11:25,683 --> 00:11:26,950
I swear.
Honestly. I swear--

316
00:11:26,984 --> 00:11:28,451
You can't be angry now--
my grandmother.

317
00:11:28,485 --> 00:11:30,219
No, I know. I know.
I honestly thought

318
00:11:30,287 --> 00:11:32,155
That something like that
might've happened.

319
00:11:32,189 --> 00:11:33,690
I was definitely bummed,
[sighs]

320
00:11:33,724 --> 00:11:35,558
But...Mostly,
I was just mad

321
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,160
We hadn't exchanged
any phone numbers

322
00:11:37,194 --> 00:11:38,561
Or any information.
I know.

323
00:11:38,562 --> 00:11:39,896
I know.
That was so stupid.

324
00:11:39,897 --> 00:11:41,731
No way to get in touch.
We had nothing to go on.

325
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:43,633
I didn't know
your last name, nothing.

326
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:45,001
I know, I know. Remember,
we were both afraid

327
00:11:45,035 --> 00:11:46,736
That if we started
writing and calling,

328
00:11:46,804 --> 00:11:48,638
That it would slowly...
You know, fade out.

329
00:11:48,672 --> 00:11:50,373
Yeah, it definitely
wasn't a slow fade.

330
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:52,208
No, it sure wasn't.
[laughs]

331
00:11:52,242 --> 00:11:54,010
I know, we wanted to
pick it up where we left off.

332
00:11:54,044 --> 00:11:55,745
Which would've been fine
if it had worked.

333
00:11:55,746 --> 00:11:57,080
Yes, a good idea. Yep.
Oh, well.

334
00:11:57,147 --> 00:11:58,348
[sighs]

335
00:11:58,349 --> 00:12:00,249
So...
So...

336
00:12:00,317 --> 00:12:01,751
How long were you
in vienna, then?

337
00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:03,353
Eh, just a couple days.

338
00:12:05,255 --> 00:12:07,323
Did you meet
another girl?

339
00:12:07,358 --> 00:12:08,358
Uh, yeah.

340
00:12:08,392 --> 00:12:09,592
Her name was gretchen,

341
00:12:09,593 --> 00:12:11,227
And she was amazing.
You did?

342
00:12:11,261 --> 00:12:12,929
Yeah, the book's really
a composite of the two of you.

343
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,330
Really? Oh, no.
No, I'm kidding.

344
00:12:14,365 --> 00:12:15,765
You wouldn't believe it.

345
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:17,333
I even went back
to the train station.

346
00:12:17,368 --> 00:12:19,869
I put up signs, you know,
of my number at the hotel

347
00:12:19,903 --> 00:12:21,404
Oh...
In case you'd been delayed.

348
00:12:21,438 --> 00:12:22,839
I was a total dork.

349
00:12:22,873 --> 00:12:24,540
Let's go this way.
Did you get any calls?

350
00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:27,377
Just a couple hookers
looking for a gig, you know.

351
00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:28,911
No,
it was awful.

352
00:12:28,946 --> 00:12:30,513
I mean, what do you
want me to say? Like...

353
00:12:30,547 --> 00:12:32,148
Oh, that's so sad.
I'm so sorry.

354
00:12:32,182 --> 00:12:33,850
I walked around
for a couple days.

355
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:35,418
Eventually, I flew home.

356
00:12:35,452 --> 00:12:37,720
I owed my dad 2000 bucks.

357
00:12:37,755 --> 00:12:40,156
Who had warned me about
french chicks, I have to say.

358
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,791
What did he tell you
about french women?

359
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:43,126
Nothing, the guy--

360
00:12:43,127 --> 00:12:44,727
He's never met any french women.
Okay.

361
00:12:44,762 --> 00:12:47,130
He's never been east
of the mississippi.

362
00:12:47,197 --> 00:12:49,565
So why didn't you put
that six months later

363
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,367
The french bitch
didn't show up?

364
00:12:51,402 --> 00:12:53,136
No, but I did. I did.

365
00:12:53,137 --> 00:12:54,570
You did? No.
Yeah, no--

366
00:12:54,605 --> 00:12:56,139
I mean, I made it
more hopeful.

367
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,640
I-- I wrote this
whole fictional version

368
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,042
Where you actually
do show up.

369
00:12:59,076 --> 00:13:00,043
Oh, what happens?

370
00:13:00,077 --> 00:13:02,278
Well, um...

371
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,781
What?
Uh, we--

372
00:13:04,815 --> 00:13:06,449
We make love
for about 10 days straight.

373
00:13:06,483 --> 00:13:08,051
That's one part of it.

374
00:13:08,085 --> 00:13:09,619
Oh, that's interesting.
So the french slut, right?

375
00:13:09,653 --> 00:13:10,954
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah, okay, great. Okay.

376
00:13:10,988 --> 00:13:12,722
It's just then,
you know, they--

377
00:13:12,756 --> 00:13:14,324
They start to get to
know each other better,

378
00:13:14,325 --> 00:13:16,059
And they realize that
they don't get along at all.

379
00:13:16,093 --> 00:13:17,827
Oh, I like that.
It's more real.

380
00:13:17,828 --> 00:13:19,329
Yeah, well, my editor
didn't think that way.

381
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,064
No, everyone wants
to believe in love.

382
00:13:21,098 --> 00:13:24,300
It sells, right?
Yeah, exactly, so...

383
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:26,235
So things are going well
for you, right?

384
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,504
I mean, your book
is a best-seller in the u.S.

385
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:30,006
Yeah-- er, it's
a tiny best-seller.

386
00:13:30,074 --> 00:13:31,574
Oh, come on.
No, uh--

387
00:13:31,609 --> 00:13:33,176
All right. Yeah, right,
officially, yes,

388
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:34,444
<i>But most people haven't read
moby dick, you know,</i>

389
00:13:34,478 --> 00:13:36,412
So why should
they read my book?

390
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:38,247
<i>I haven't read moby dick,
and I liked your book, so...</i>

391
00:13:38,282 --> 00:13:39,482
Oh. Thanks.
I mean--

392
00:13:39,516 --> 00:13:40,984
Even though...
[chuckles]

393
00:13:41,018 --> 00:13:42,785
I thought you idealized
the night of it.

394
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,187
Oh. Come on.

395
00:13:44,188 --> 00:13:45,788
It's officially
fiction, right?

396
00:13:45,823 --> 00:13:46,990
No, no.
I mean, I'm supposed to...

397
00:13:47,024 --> 00:13:48,524
I know. I know,
I thought, you know,

398
00:13:48,592 --> 00:13:50,259
There were times
where you made me--

399
00:13:50,294 --> 00:13:51,527
[gasps]
what?

400
00:13:51,528 --> 00:13:53,162
Well, I mean,
"her," right?

401
00:13:53,197 --> 00:13:54,464
No, "me."

402
00:13:54,498 --> 00:13:55,665
Okay, whatever.

403
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:57,500
Uh, a little bit neurotic.

404
00:13:57,534 --> 00:13:59,669
All right. But you are a little
bit like that, aren't you?

405
00:13:59,703 --> 00:14:01,204
You think I'm neurotic?
No. No, no.

406
00:14:01,205 --> 00:14:02,639
No. Come on,
I'm kidding.

407
00:14:02,673 --> 00:14:04,274
Where did I do that?
I didn't do that.

408
00:14:04,308 --> 00:14:05,708
Well, maybe it's just me.

409
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:07,944
You know, um...
Reading something,

410
00:14:07,978 --> 00:14:10,213
Knowing that the character
in the story is based on you,

411
00:14:10,281 --> 00:14:13,182
It's both...Flattering
and disturbing at the same time.

412
00:14:13,217 --> 00:14:14,884
Yeah? H-how is
it disturbing?

413
00:14:14,885 --> 00:14:16,386
I don't know.

414
00:14:16,387 --> 00:14:19,622
Um, just being part of
someone else's memory.

415
00:14:19,657 --> 00:14:22,058
Seeing myself
through your eyes.

416
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:24,060
How long did it
take you to write it?

417
00:14:24,128 --> 00:14:25,628
Um... Uh...

418
00:14:25,663 --> 00:14:27,830
Three or four years,
on and off.

419
00:14:27,865 --> 00:14:29,332
Wow, that's
a really long time

420
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:30,833
To be writing
about one night.

421
00:14:30,868 --> 00:14:32,568
Yeah, I know.
Tell me about it.

422
00:14:32,636 --> 00:14:34,070
[groans]

423
00:14:34,071 --> 00:14:35,805
I always assumed
you had forgotten me.

424
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,240
[chuckles]

425
00:14:37,241 --> 00:14:39,909
No, I had a pretty clear picture
of you in my mind.

426
00:14:39,977 --> 00:14:41,210
I have to tell you
something.

427
00:14:41,245 --> 00:14:42,578
I just--
what?

428
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:44,147
I've wanted to
talk to you for so long.

429
00:14:44,181 --> 00:14:45,682
But now--
yeah, me too.

430
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:47,250
It's just surreal.
I know, I know.

431
00:14:47,251 --> 00:14:48,851
I feel like everything
out of my mouth should be--

432
00:14:48,886 --> 00:14:50,687
How long do we have?
Twenty minutes and 30 seconds?

433
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:52,722
Let's go.
No, we got more than that.

434
00:14:52,756 --> 00:14:54,691
I want to know about you.
Tell me, what are you doing?

435
00:14:54,725 --> 00:14:56,225
You know,
what are you up to?

436
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,593
Uh... Where to start?
I, uh...

437
00:14:57,594 --> 00:14:59,429
I work for green cross.

438
00:14:59,496 --> 00:15:01,097
It's an environmental
organization.

439
00:15:01,098 --> 00:15:02,432
Yeah, what are
they all about?

440
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:03,666
Well, we basically work

441
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:05,101
On different
environment issues,

442
00:15:05,102 --> 00:15:06,536
From clean water
right.

443
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,104
To disarmament
of chemical weapons.

444
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:09,672
You know,
international laws

445
00:15:09,707 --> 00:15:10,773
That deal
with the environment.

446
00:15:10,774 --> 00:15:11,774
And wh-what do you
do for them?

447
00:15:11,775 --> 00:15:13,376
We're going this way.
Oh.

448
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,111
Uh... Different things.

449
00:15:15,112 --> 00:15:17,280
Like, last year I was in india
for quite a while,

450
00:15:17,348 --> 00:15:18,948
Working on
a water-treatment plant.

451
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:20,116
Wow!

452
00:15:20,117 --> 00:15:21,918
Yeah, well,
the cotton industry there

453
00:15:21,952 --> 00:15:23,286
Is a major source
of pollution. So...

454
00:15:23,287 --> 00:15:24,787
I mean, itust sounds
like you're actually

455
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:26,422
Doing something,
you know?

456
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:28,091
I mean, most people,
myself included,

457
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:31,094
Just sit around
and bitch.

458
00:15:31,128 --> 00:15:33,463
America's consuming
all the world's resources,

459
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:34,764
Yep.
Suvs suck,

460
00:15:34,798 --> 00:15:36,165
Global warming is real.

461
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,300
You know, I'm really
relieved to hear

462
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:38,668
You're not one of those

463
00:15:38,702 --> 00:15:40,103
"freedom fries"
kind of americans.

464
00:15:40,137 --> 00:15:41,537
Yeah, well...
Hey, you know...

465
00:15:41,572 --> 00:15:42,639
But how'd you
get into that?

466
00:15:42,673 --> 00:15:44,474
Ah, I came out
of political science,

467
00:15:44,508 --> 00:15:46,175
And I was hoping to work
for the government,

468
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,610
And I did
for a little while.

469
00:15:47,645 --> 00:15:49,078
Ugh. Terrible.
Not good?

470
00:15:49,113 --> 00:15:51,514
Yeah, no. Anyway,
I got really tired--

471
00:15:51,548 --> 00:15:53,082
Let's go this way.

472
00:15:53,117 --> 00:15:54,984
--of having this endless
conversation with friends

473
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:57,587
About how the world
was falling to pieces,

474
00:15:57,621 --> 00:15:59,756
So I decided
what I really wanted to do

475
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,624
Was to find things
that could be fixed

476
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:03,126
And try to fix them,
you know?

477
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,094
Yeah, you know, I just--
well...

478
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:06,763
I've always thought you'd be
doing something cool like that.

479
00:16:06,797 --> 00:16:07,764
I did. I...

480
00:16:07,798 --> 00:16:08,798
Thanks.
I just--

481
00:16:08,832 --> 00:16:10,900
I just feel really...

482
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:13,336
Really lucky to be doing
a job I like, you know?

483
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,504
Yeah.

484
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:16,139
You know,
I actually alternated

485
00:16:16,173 --> 00:16:17,774
Between thinking that,
you know,

486
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:19,809
Everything is
irrevocably screwed up,

487
00:16:19,843 --> 00:16:21,878
And that things might be
getting better in some ways.

488
00:16:21,912 --> 00:16:24,547
Better? How could you
possibly say that?

489
00:16:24,581 --> 00:16:26,349
Well, I just mean,
you know, like...

490
00:16:26,383 --> 00:16:28,117
I mean, I know
it sounds weird,

491
00:16:28,152 --> 00:16:30,320
But there are things
to be optimistic about.

492
00:16:30,354 --> 00:16:31,821
Okay.

493
00:16:31,855 --> 00:16:33,990
Um, I know your book is selling,
which is great.

494
00:16:34,024 --> 00:16:35,591
I'm very happy for you,
I--

495
00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:36,993
But let me break
the news to you, okay?

496
00:16:37,027 --> 00:16:39,062
The world is a mess right now.
I'm not--

497
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:40,897
I wasn't--
from a western point of view,

498
00:16:40,931 --> 00:16:42,665
Things are getting
a bit better, okay.

499
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,000
We're moving all our industry
to developing nations

500
00:16:44,034 --> 00:16:45,401
I know--
where we can get cheap labor

501
00:16:45,436 --> 00:16:46,970
Free of any
environmental laws, okay.

502
00:16:47,004 --> 00:16:48,404
The weapon industry
is booming.

503
00:16:48,439 --> 00:16:50,340
Five million people
die every year

504
00:16:50,374 --> 00:16:52,108
From preventable water diseases.
Right. I know. I--

505
00:16:52,142 --> 00:16:53,910
So how is the world
getting any better?

506
00:16:53,944 --> 00:16:56,112
I'm not getting angry,
but come on, I want to know.

507
00:16:56,146 --> 00:16:57,480
I'm interested.
Okay. Okay.

508
00:16:57,514 --> 00:16:59,282
I realize...
[sighs]

509
00:16:59,316 --> 00:17:01,050
That there are a lot of
serious problems in the world.

510
00:17:01,085 --> 00:17:02,652
Okay, thank you.
Okay?

511
00:17:02,686 --> 00:17:04,120
I mean, I don't
even have one publisher

512
00:17:04,154 --> 00:17:05,622
In the whole asian market.

513
00:17:05,656 --> 00:17:07,790
Okay. All right.
[laughs]

514
00:17:07,825 --> 00:17:09,158
Say "stop."
what, what?

515
00:17:09,193 --> 00:17:10,293
Stop.
Ohhh!

516
00:17:10,327 --> 00:17:11,894
No, look, all I'm saying

517
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:13,229
Is there's more awareness
out there, right?

518
00:17:13,263 --> 00:17:14,297
People are gonna fight back,

519
00:17:14,331 --> 00:17:15,732
Okay.
You know? I mean--

520
00:17:15,766 --> 00:17:17,500
I mean, I think the world
might be getting better

521
00:17:17,534 --> 00:17:20,103
Because people like you
are educated and speaking out.

522
00:17:20,137 --> 00:17:22,105
Even the very notion
of conservation

523
00:17:22,139 --> 00:17:23,706
And environmental issues,
yeah.

524
00:17:23,741 --> 00:17:25,074
Those weren't even
in the vocabulary

525
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,276
Until fairly recently,
you know?

526
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,477
And they're becoming
the norm,

527
00:17:27,511 --> 00:17:28,778
And eventually,
might be what's expected

528
00:17:28,812 --> 00:17:30,346
All over the world,
you'd think.

529
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:31,814
I agree with
what you're saying,

530
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:33,483
But at the same time,
it's dangerous.

531
00:17:33,517 --> 00:17:34,784
An imperialist country

532
00:17:34,818 --> 00:17:36,252
Can use that kind
of thinking

533
00:17:36,287 --> 00:17:38,054
To justify
their economic greed.

534
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:40,556
Yeah.
You know, hu-- human rights--

535
00:17:40,591 --> 00:17:42,492
Is there any particular
imperialist country

536
00:17:42,526 --> 00:17:44,160
You have in mind
there, frenchie?

537
00:17:44,194 --> 00:17:45,228
Hmm. No, not really.

538
00:17:45,262 --> 00:17:46,329
No?
Mm-mmm.

539
00:17:46,363 --> 00:17:47,864
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

540
00:17:47,898 --> 00:17:49,666
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

541
00:17:51,001 --> 00:17:52,068
[sighs]

542
00:17:52,102 --> 00:17:53,369
So you want
to sit over there?

543
00:17:53,404 --> 00:17:55,705
Yeah, all this is perfect.

544
00:17:55,739 --> 00:17:57,073
Oh, wow.

545
00:17:57,107 --> 00:17:59,442
Maybe what I'm saying is,
is the world might be

546
00:17:59,476 --> 00:18:01,544
Evolving the way
a person evolves, right?

547
00:18:01,578 --> 00:18:03,479
Mm-hmmm.
Like, I mean, me, for example.

548
00:18:03,514 --> 00:18:04,981
Am I getting worse?

549
00:18:05,015 --> 00:18:06,049
Am I improving?

550
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,383
I don't know.

551
00:18:07,418 --> 00:18:09,319
When I was younger...
I was healthier,

552
00:18:09,353 --> 00:18:12,422
But I was, uh, wracked
with insecurity, you know?

553
00:18:12,456 --> 00:18:15,058
Now I'm older,
and my problems are deeper,

554
00:18:15,092 --> 00:18:18,127
But I'm more equipped
to handle them.

555
00:18:18,162 --> 00:18:20,263
So, what are
your problems?

556
00:18:21,131 --> 00:18:22,131
Right now...

557
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,433
I don't have any.

558
00:18:23,467 --> 00:18:24,601
I don't, you know?

559
00:18:24,635 --> 00:18:25,868
I'm just...
[inhales]

560
00:18:25,903 --> 00:18:28,071
Damn happy to be here.

561
00:18:28,105 --> 00:18:29,806
Me too.

562
00:18:32,576 --> 00:18:35,311
So how long have you
been in paris?

563
00:18:35,346 --> 00:18:38,548
I got in last night. I've done
10 cities in 12 days, and I'm...

564
00:18:38,582 --> 00:18:41,184
I'm wrecked. I'm so glad
it's over, you know?

565
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:42,785
I'm tired of being
a huckster.

566
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,020
Hello.

567
00:18:44,054 --> 00:18:45,021
[speaks french]

568
00:18:45,055 --> 00:18:46,122
What do you want?

569
00:18:46,156 --> 00:18:47,924
Um... A cup of coffee.

570
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,226
[speaks french]

571
00:18:51,328 --> 00:18:52,462
[sighs]

572
00:18:52,496 --> 00:18:53,930
God, I love this café.

573
00:18:53,964 --> 00:18:56,666
I wish they had places
like this in the u.S.

574
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,535
Yeah, I missed cafés
when I was living over there.

575
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,871
I mean, I find a few places
I really liked,

576
00:19:01,905 --> 00:19:03,172
But there was--
wait, you--

577
00:19:03,207 --> 00:19:04,607
You were living in the u.S.?

578
00:19:04,642 --> 00:19:06,676
Yes, from, uh,
'96 to '99.

579
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,578
I was studying at nyu.

580
00:19:08,612 --> 00:19:10,213
Oh, god!

581
00:19:10,247 --> 00:19:11,581
Don't tell me that, celine.

582
00:19:11,615 --> 00:19:13,850
What?
No. No, it's just...

583
00:19:13,884 --> 00:19:15,652
Nothing. I mean, I--
what?

584
00:19:15,686 --> 00:19:17,687
I've been living in new york
since '98, you know?

585
00:19:17,721 --> 00:19:19,088
We were there at the same time.

586
00:19:19,123 --> 00:19:20,523
In new york?
Yeah.

587
00:19:20,557 --> 00:19:22,425
Wow, that's weird.

588
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:24,260
It actually crossed my mind
a few times

589
00:19:24,295 --> 00:19:25,795
That I might run into you,

590
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:28,498
But the odds are so
slim, right? So...

591
00:19:28,532 --> 00:19:30,700
I didn't even know
what city you were living in.

592
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:32,502
Weren't you
somewhere in texas?

593
00:19:32,536 --> 00:19:33,770
Point, texas.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Definitely.

594
00:19:33,804 --> 00:19:35,471
I just--
I was for a long time.

595
00:19:35,506 --> 00:19:38,374
I just...You know,
wanted to try new york.

596
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:40,276
Hmmm. Wow.

597
00:19:40,311 --> 00:19:41,945
What brought you
back here?

598
00:19:41,979 --> 00:19:44,180
Uh... I had finished
my master's, for one,

599
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:46,783
And no visa,
no more visa.

600
00:19:46,817 --> 00:19:49,018
And anyway, I was
starting to get paranoid.

601
00:19:49,053 --> 00:19:51,254
All the violence
in the medias,

602
00:19:51,288 --> 00:19:53,089
Gang violence, murders,
oh, yeah. Right.

603
00:19:53,123 --> 00:19:54,724
Especially
serial killers.

604
00:19:54,758 --> 00:19:56,125
[laughs]

605
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,027
But the final straw was

606
00:19:58,062 --> 00:20:00,763
One night I heard some noise
on my fire escape,

607
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:02,332
So I called 911,

608
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:04,167
And the cops came
eventually.

609
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:05,768
Yeah, three hours later.
Yeah, after I'd been...

610
00:20:05,803 --> 00:20:06,836
Raped and killed
about three times.

611
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,137
[laughs]

612
00:20:08,172 --> 00:20:10,707
No, but-- it was a man
and a woman officer,

613
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:12,709
And I was explaining to them
what I had heard

614
00:20:12,743 --> 00:20:14,143
When the woman
had to run downstairs

615
00:20:14,178 --> 00:20:15,578
To move the police car,

616
00:20:15,613 --> 00:20:17,146
So I was left alone
with the male cop,

617
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:19,382
And right away he asked me
if I had a gun,

618
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,718
And I said,
"no, of course not. I..."

619
00:20:21,752 --> 00:20:23,186
And he told me,

620
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,921
"well, you'd better think
about getting one.

621
00:20:24,922 --> 00:20:27,390
This is america,
not France."

622
00:20:27,424 --> 00:20:29,592
Okay? And I said to him,
you know,

623
00:20:29,593 --> 00:20:31,828
"I have no idea
how to shoot a gun,

624
00:20:31,862 --> 00:20:34,697
And I have no interest
in firearms whatsoever,"

625
00:20:34,732 --> 00:20:37,166
And that's when he pulled out
his gun like this:

626
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:40,436
And he went,
"well, one day...

627
00:20:40,437 --> 00:20:44,107
"you're gonna have something
like this in your face,

628
00:20:44,174 --> 00:20:47,076
"and if you wanna have
a long life...

629
00:20:47,111 --> 00:20:51,214
You're gonna have to choose
between you or them."

630
00:20:51,248 --> 00:20:53,116
And then they left.

631
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:54,617
And the next morning,

632
00:20:54,618 --> 00:20:56,252
I called for an application
to get a gun.

633
00:20:56,287 --> 00:20:57,954
[laughs]
me, with a gun.

634
00:20:58,022 --> 00:20:59,622
I mean,
that's really scary.

635
00:20:59,623 --> 00:21:01,724
But then I realized
something was wrong.

636
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:03,526
The way that cop
had pulled his gun out,

637
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,228
And everything, right?
Yeah, sure.

638
00:21:05,262 --> 00:21:06,929
So I cancelled
my demand for the gun,

639
00:21:06,964 --> 00:21:08,798
And I called
the police station

640
00:21:08,866 --> 00:21:10,566
And tried to complain
about that cop's behavior, but--

641
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:11,734
What happened with that?

642
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:12,902
It was so much paperwork.

643
00:21:12,937 --> 00:21:14,404
[laughs]
and then I got

644
00:21:14,438 --> 00:21:15,805
Scared with my shitty
student visa.

645
00:21:15,873 --> 00:21:17,240
Yeah, he thought
you'd get deported?

646
00:21:17,274 --> 00:21:18,808
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah.

647
00:21:18,876 --> 00:21:20,610
So I gave up, and I forgot about
the whole thing.

648
00:21:20,644 --> 00:21:22,211
Well, I guess
I never forgot.

649
00:21:22,246 --> 00:21:23,546
Well, obviously.
I'll get through.

650
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,814
Yeah.
[chuckles]

651
00:21:24,882 --> 00:21:26,316
But still, you know,
[sighs]

652
00:21:26,317 --> 00:21:27,951
I really enjoyed
being there.

653
00:21:27,985 --> 00:21:29,852
There's a lot of things
I miss about the u.S.

654
00:21:29,887 --> 00:21:32,655
Yeah, like what?
Um...

655
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,557
Well...

656
00:21:34,591 --> 00:21:36,726
The overall good mood
people have there,

657
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,429
Like, you know, even if
it can be bullshit sometimes.

658
00:21:39,463 --> 00:21:40,763
Like, "how you doing?"

659
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:42,398
"great, how you doing?"
"great!"

660
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:44,567
[laughs]
"have a great day!"

661
00:21:44,602 --> 00:21:46,035
I don't know.

662
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:49,105
Parisians can be so grumpy,
have you noticed?

663
00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:50,406
Mmm... No, everybody seems
no?

664
00:21:50,441 --> 00:21:51,941
Pretty happy to me.

665
00:21:51,976 --> 00:21:53,209
Mmm. They're not happy.

666
00:21:53,243 --> 00:21:54,277
They're not happy?
Nnnn-- no.

667
00:21:54,311 --> 00:21:55,511
[both laugh]

668
00:21:55,546 --> 00:21:57,413
No, they are.
I don't know, really.

669
00:21:57,448 --> 00:21:59,115
I just mean french men.
They drive me nuts.

670
00:21:59,149 --> 00:22:00,717
What is it?
What about them?

671
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:02,385
Well, they're very nice.
They--

672
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:03,786
They're great, you know,
to be around.

673
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:05,221
They love food, wine.

674
00:22:05,255 --> 00:22:07,023
They're great cooks,
but I don't know,

675
00:22:07,057 --> 00:22:08,257
Maybe I've-- I've had
really bad luck with them.

676
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:09,993
Well, why,
what do you mean?

677
00:22:10,027 --> 00:22:11,728
Um, well.

678
00:22:11,762 --> 00:22:13,262
I guess
they're not as...

679
00:22:13,297 --> 00:22:14,864
What?
What's the word?

680
00:22:14,865 --> 00:22:16,532
Um...

681
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,867
Horny?
[laughs]

682
00:22:17,935 --> 00:22:19,702
They're not as horny.
Horny?

683
00:22:19,703 --> 00:22:21,537
All right, now, wait.
Now listen to me on this one.

684
00:22:21,605 --> 00:22:24,641
All right, in that regard,
I am proud to be an american.

685
00:22:24,675 --> 00:22:26,376
And you should be,
in that regard only.

686
00:22:26,443 --> 00:22:27,710
<i>Merci.</i>

687
00:22:27,778 --> 00:22:29,946
Have you ever spent some time
in eastern europe?

688
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,714
Eastern--? No. I don't--

689
00:22:31,715 --> 00:22:33,716
No?
Thank you.

690
00:22:33,784 --> 00:22:36,319
I remember as a teenager
I went to warsaw

691
00:22:36,353 --> 00:22:38,488
When it was still
a strict communist regime--

692
00:22:38,522 --> 00:22:40,556
Which I don't
approve of at all.

693
00:22:40,624 --> 00:22:41,958
Oh, yeah, sure you do.

694
00:22:41,992 --> 00:22:43,960
No, I don't.
No, I was just kidding.

695
00:22:43,994 --> 00:22:45,695
But anyway,
something about being there

696
00:22:45,729 --> 00:22:47,230
Was very interesting,
I found.

697
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:50,633
After a couple of weeks,
something changed in me.

698
00:22:50,668 --> 00:22:53,636
The city was
quite gloomy and gray, and...

699
00:22:53,671 --> 00:22:56,806
But after a while,
my brain seemed clearer.

700
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,574
I was writing a lot more
in my journal,

701
00:22:58,642 --> 00:23:00,276
Ideas I'd never
thought of before--

702
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:01,911
Communist ideas?

703
00:23:01,946 --> 00:23:03,379
Listen, I am not
a communist. No.

704
00:23:03,414 --> 00:23:04,347
Sorry, I can't--
well, okay.

705
00:23:05,282 --> 00:23:06,282
Go on.

706
00:23:06,317 --> 00:23:07,650
Okay.
[both laugh]

707
00:23:07,685 --> 00:23:09,118
I'll send you to a gulag.
Okay.

708
00:23:09,153 --> 00:23:11,187
No, well, it took me a while
to figure out

709
00:23:11,221 --> 00:23:12,588
Why I felt, you know,
so different.

710
00:23:12,623 --> 00:23:14,090
And then one day,

711
00:23:14,124 --> 00:23:15,758
As I was walking through
the jewish cemetery,

712
00:23:15,793 --> 00:23:17,660
I don't know why,
but it occurred to me there,

713
00:23:17,695 --> 00:23:19,996
I realized that I had spent
the last two weeks

714
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,864
Away from most of my habits.

715
00:23:21,899 --> 00:23:23,866
Tv was in a language
I didn't understand.

716
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:25,101
There was nothing to buy.

717
00:23:25,135 --> 00:23:26,736
No advertisements anywhere.

718
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,471
So all I'd been doing
was...

719
00:23:28,505 --> 00:23:31,307
Walk around, think
and write.

720
00:23:31,342 --> 00:23:33,443
My brain felt like
it was at rest,

721
00:23:33,477 --> 00:23:35,445
Free from
the "consuming" frenzy.

722
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:37,313
And I have to say, it was
almost like a natural high.

723
00:23:37,348 --> 00:23:38,982
I felt so peaceful
inside.

724
00:23:39,016 --> 00:23:42,085
No strange urge
to be somewhere else,

725
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:43,686
To shop...
Mm-hmm.

726
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:45,555
Maybe it could have seemed
like boredom at first,

727
00:23:45,589 --> 00:23:47,924
But it quickly became
very, very soulful.

728
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:48,958
Hmm.

729
00:23:48,993 --> 00:23:50,627
It was interesting,
you know?

730
00:23:50,661 --> 00:23:52,028
Can you believe
it was nine years ago

731
00:23:52,062 --> 00:23:53,896
That we were
walking around vienna?

732
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:55,064
Nine years?

733
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:56,699
No, that's impossible.
Nine. I was.

734
00:23:56,734 --> 00:23:58,167
I know, it feels
like two months ago to me,

735
00:23:58,202 --> 00:23:59,535
But it was summer '94.

736
00:24:00,271 --> 00:24:02,505
Mm-hmm.

737
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:04,040
Do I look any different?

738
00:24:06,176 --> 00:24:07,277
I do?

739
00:24:08,812 --> 00:24:10,046
I'd have to see you naked.

740
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,180
What?!
I know, I'm sorry.

741
00:24:11,215 --> 00:24:12,448
[both laugh]

742
00:24:12,483 --> 00:24:13,950
No, your hair was
different back then.

743
00:24:13,984 --> 00:24:15,318
It was like...
Well, it's the same--

744
00:24:15,352 --> 00:24:16,819
Yeah, take it down.
Let's see.

745
00:24:16,854 --> 00:24:18,187
Down. It was down, okay.

746
00:24:18,222 --> 00:24:19,689
Yeah.

747
00:24:19,723 --> 00:24:21,291
<i>Well? Voilà.</i>

748
00:24:22,126 --> 00:24:23,459
So?

749
00:24:25,663 --> 00:24:27,830
Well...
Okay, come on. Tell me.

750
00:24:28,699 --> 00:24:30,767
Uh...

751
00:24:30,801 --> 00:24:33,736
Skinnier, I think.
Little thinner.

752
00:24:34,672 --> 00:24:36,306
Did you think
I was fat before?

753
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,674
No.
[laughs]

754
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:39,409
Yeah, you thought
I was a fatty.

755
00:24:39,443 --> 00:24:41,244
No, you thought
I was a fatty!

756
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:43,479
Yeah, you wrote a book
about a fat french girl.

757
00:24:43,514 --> 00:24:45,848
No, listen.
Oh, no...

758
00:24:45,883 --> 00:24:47,917
Seriously, all right,
you look beautiful.

759
00:24:47,952 --> 00:24:49,585
Do I look any different?

760
00:24:50,421 --> 00:24:51,387
No.
Mmm?

761
00:24:51,422 --> 00:24:52,622
Not at all.

762
00:24:52,656 --> 00:24:54,190
Oh. Actually,
you have this line.

763
00:24:54,224 --> 00:24:55,291
I know.

764
00:24:55,326 --> 00:24:56,926
It's like a scar.

765
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:58,061
A scar?

766
00:24:58,095 --> 00:24:59,662
What, like a gunshot wound?
[laughs]

767
00:24:59,697 --> 00:25:01,564
No, no, no, I like it.
I'm sorry.

768
00:25:02,933 --> 00:25:04,734
I had this...Funny--

769
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:08,504
Well...Horrible dream
the other day. Um...

770
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:10,840
I was having
this awful nightmare

771
00:25:10,874 --> 00:25:12,809
That I was 32,
really?

772
00:25:12,843 --> 00:25:14,744
And then I woke up,
and I was 23.

773
00:25:14,778 --> 00:25:16,212
So relieved.
Right.

774
00:25:16,246 --> 00:25:18,881
And then I woke up for real,
and I was 32.

775
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:20,116
Shit. I know.
Scary.

776
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,618
It happens.

777
00:25:21,652 --> 00:25:23,353
Yeah, time goes
faster and faster.

778
00:25:23,387 --> 00:25:25,221
Apparently,
it's because we don't

779
00:25:25,255 --> 00:25:26,522
Renew our synapses after 20,
so it's pretty much

780
00:25:26,557 --> 00:25:28,024
Downhill from then on. Oh, well.
Yeah.

781
00:25:28,058 --> 00:25:29,225
[laughs]

782
00:25:29,259 --> 00:25:30,526
I like getting older,
you know?

783
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:31,961
Life feels...

784
00:25:31,996 --> 00:25:33,162
I don't know,

785
00:25:33,197 --> 00:25:34,797
It feels more immediate.
Mm-hmm.

786
00:25:34,832 --> 00:25:36,065
You know, like,
I can appreciate things more.

787
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,734
No, me too, actually.

788
00:25:37,768 --> 00:25:39,535
I-- I really love it.

789
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,838
I was once a...

790
00:25:41,872 --> 00:25:43,373
A drummer in a band.

791
00:25:43,407 --> 00:25:44,707
You were?
Yeah.

792
00:25:44,742 --> 00:25:46,175
We were pretty good, actually.
Wow.

793
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,244
Mm-hmm.
But the lead singer guy,

794
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:50,747
He was just so obsessed with us
getting a record deal, you know?

795
00:25:50,781 --> 00:25:52,582
Yeah.
It's all we talked about.

796
00:25:52,616 --> 00:25:54,317
It's all we thought about,
getting bigger shows.

797
00:25:54,351 --> 00:25:56,085
Everything was just focused
on the future all the time.

798
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,453
And now the...

799
00:25:57,488 --> 00:25:59,222
Band doesn't even
exist anymore, right?

800
00:25:59,256 --> 00:26:00,523
And looking back at the...

801
00:26:00,557 --> 00:26:02,125
At the shows we did play,

802
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,528
Even rehearsing, you know?
It was so much fun.

803
00:26:05,562 --> 00:26:07,530
Now I'd be able to enjoy
every minute of it.

804
00:26:07,564 --> 00:26:09,632
Could I have a drag of that?
Mm-hmm.

805
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:11,367
Well, your book
has been published.

806
00:26:11,402 --> 00:26:12,735
That's-- that's
a pretty big deal,

807
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,437
And you've been
all around europe with it.

808
00:26:14,471 --> 00:26:16,205
Are you enjoying
every minute of it?

809
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,473
Not really.

810
00:26:17,508 --> 00:26:18,741
Not really?
No.

811
00:26:18,776 --> 00:26:20,543
[both laugh]

812
00:26:20,577 --> 00:26:21,978
You have
another one of those?

813
00:26:22,012 --> 00:26:24,013
Yes, of course.

814
00:26:24,048 --> 00:26:25,114
Um...

815
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:26,382
Here.

816
00:26:27,851 --> 00:26:30,186
In my field, I see
these people that--

817
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,454
Oh, sorry.

818
00:26:31,488 --> 00:26:33,623
--come into it
with big idealist visions

819
00:26:33,657 --> 00:26:36,893
Of becoming the new leader
that will create a better world.

820
00:26:36,927 --> 00:26:39,228
They enjoy the goal,
but not the process.

821
00:26:39,263 --> 00:26:40,897
Right.
But the reality of it is

822
00:26:40,931 --> 00:26:42,765
That the true work
of improving things

823
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,767
Is in the little achievements
of the day,

824
00:26:44,802 --> 00:26:46,970
And that's what you need
to enjoy, to stay in that field.

825
00:26:47,004 --> 00:26:48,938
What do you mean here, exactly?
Well, for example,

826
00:26:48,973 --> 00:26:50,473
I was working
for this organization

827
00:26:50,507 --> 00:26:52,041
That helped
villages in mexico,

828
00:26:52,076 --> 00:26:55,111
And their concerns
was how to get the pencils

829
00:26:55,145 --> 00:26:57,680
Sent to the kid
in those little country schools.

830
00:26:57,715 --> 00:26:59,949
It was not about big,
revolutionary ideas.

831
00:26:59,984 --> 00:27:01,751
Hmm.
It was about pencils.

832
00:27:01,785 --> 00:27:03,753
I see the people
that do the real work,

833
00:27:03,787 --> 00:27:05,788
And what's really sad,
in a way, is that

834
00:27:05,823 --> 00:27:08,024
The people that are
the most giving, hard-working,

835
00:27:08,058 --> 00:27:10,593
And capable
of making this world better

836
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:13,997
Usually don't have the ego
and ambition to be a leader.

837
00:27:14,031 --> 00:27:16,599
They don't see any interest
in superficial rewards.

838
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:17,967
They don't care

839
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:20,270
If their name ever appear
in the press.

840
00:27:20,304 --> 00:27:22,639
They actually enjoy
the process of helping others.

841
00:27:22,673 --> 00:27:24,440
They're in the moment.

842
00:27:24,475 --> 00:27:25,908
Yeah, but that's so hard,

843
00:27:25,943 --> 00:27:27,677
You know, to be in the moment.
Yeah.

844
00:27:27,711 --> 00:27:29,245
I mean, I just feel
like I'm...

845
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,913
Designed to be...

846
00:27:30,948 --> 00:27:33,182
Slightly dissatisfied
with everything, you know?

847
00:27:33,217 --> 00:27:35,918
I mean, like, always trying to
better my situation, you know?

848
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:39,122
I satisfy one desire,
and it just agitates another.

849
00:27:39,156 --> 00:27:41,524
You know, but then I think
ah, to hell with it, right?

850
00:27:41,558 --> 00:27:43,192
I mean,
desire's the fuel of life.

851
00:27:43,227 --> 00:27:44,394
Yes.
I mean, do you think

852
00:27:44,428 --> 00:27:46,729
It's true that if...

853
00:27:46,764 --> 00:27:49,265
If we never wanted anything,
we'd never be unhappy?

854
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,900
I don't know.

855
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:52,535
Not wanting anything is--

856
00:27:52,569 --> 00:27:54,070
Isn't that
a sympm of depression?

857
00:27:54,104 --> 00:27:55,138
[laughs]

858
00:27:55,172 --> 00:27:56,739
Yeah, that is, right?
Yes, I...

859
00:27:56,774 --> 00:27:58,741
I mean, it's healthy
to desire, right?

860
00:27:58,776 --> 00:28:00,376
Yeah. I don't know.

861
00:28:00,444 --> 00:28:02,478
I mean, it's what all
those buddhist guys say, right?

862
00:28:02,513 --> 00:28:04,614
You know,
liberate yourself from desire,

863
00:28:04,648 --> 00:28:06,716
And you'll find that you already
have everything you need.

864
00:28:06,717 --> 00:28:08,651
Yeah, but I feel really alive

865
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:11,154
When I want something more
than just basic survival needs.

866
00:28:11,188 --> 00:28:14,290
I mean, wanting, whether it's
intimacy with another person,

867
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,526
Or a new pair of shoes,
is kind of beautiful.

868
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,895
I like that we have
those ever-renewing desires.

869
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,496
You know?
Yeah, well,

870
00:28:20,531 --> 00:28:21,998
Maybe it's just
a sense of entitlement.

871
00:28:22,032 --> 00:28:23,566
You know, like,
whenever you feel

872
00:28:23,634 --> 00:28:25,568
Like you deserve
that new pair of shoes.

873
00:28:25,569 --> 00:28:27,370
You know? I mean,
it's okay to want things

874
00:28:27,404 --> 00:28:29,038
As long as
you don't get pissed off

875
00:28:29,073 --> 00:28:30,640
If you don't get them. Right?
Yeah.

876
00:28:30,674 --> 00:28:32,241
Life's hard.
It's supposed to be.

877
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:34,077
If we didn't suffer,
we wouldn't learn a thing,

878
00:28:34,144 --> 00:28:35,411
You know?

879
00:28:36,747 --> 00:28:38,748
So, what are you,
buddhist or something?

880
00:28:39,516 --> 00:28:42,018
No.
No? Why not?

881
00:28:42,753 --> 00:28:44,020
I don't know. Uh...

882
00:28:44,054 --> 00:28:45,421
Same reason I don't

883
00:28:45,489 --> 00:28:47,590
Really consider myself
anything, really.

884
00:28:47,658 --> 00:28:49,726
Yeah, I know.
I decided a long time ago

885
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,661
That I was gonna
be open to everything,

886
00:28:51,695 --> 00:28:54,097
But not buy into
any one and only belief system.

887
00:28:55,532 --> 00:28:57,900
I went to
this trappist monastery

888
00:28:57,935 --> 00:28:58,901
A couple years ago.

889
00:28:58,936 --> 00:29:00,436
Trappist?

890
00:29:00,437 --> 00:29:02,038
Yeah, they're
catholic, cistercian.

891
00:29:02,072 --> 00:29:03,039
Oh.
Yeah.

892
00:29:03,073 --> 00:29:04,607
Why did you do that?

893
00:29:04,608 --> 00:29:06,909
Why? I'd just been doing
some reading, I guess.

894
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,945
I don't know.
I thought it'd be cool.

895
00:29:08,946 --> 00:29:11,281
Have you ever spent any time
with any monks or nuns?

896
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:12,548
No.

897
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:14,117
It's not really my style.
No?

898
00:29:14,118 --> 00:29:15,251
No.
[both laugh]

899
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:16,886
But go ahead.
Well, I--

900
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,388
I expected them to be
all glowering and stern,

901
00:29:18,422 --> 00:29:20,223
You know, but they weren't.

902
00:29:20,257 --> 00:29:22,625
They were really quick to laugh,
really easy to be around.

903
00:29:22,626 --> 00:29:24,294
Seriously, very attuned
to everything.

904
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:25,461
[chuckles]
they were just, uh...

905
00:29:25,462 --> 00:29:26,796
You know, they weren't

906
00:29:26,797 --> 00:29:28,464
Trying to hustle anybody.
Mm-hmm.

907
00:29:28,465 --> 00:29:30,800
They're trying to live
and die in peace with god,

908
00:29:30,801 --> 00:29:33,636
You know, or whatever part
of them they feel is eternal.

909
00:29:33,704 --> 00:29:36,105
You know, and it was just
so refreshing to be around.

910
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,474
You know, you realize that most
of the people that you meet

911
00:29:38,542 --> 00:29:40,476
Are trying
to get somewhere better.

912
00:29:40,544 --> 00:29:42,312
You know, they're trying
to make a little bit more cash.

913
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:44,247
They're trying to get
a little more respect,

914
00:29:44,281 --> 00:29:45,481
Have more people admire them,
you know?

915
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:46,983
It's just exhausting.

916
00:29:46,984 --> 00:29:48,584
No kidding.
You know, and it's exhausting

917
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:49,886
To be one of those
people yourself, you know?

918
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,821
[laughs]
I mean, there I am, right?

919
00:29:51,822 --> 00:29:53,589
You know, all greedy
to be more spiritual, you know?

920
00:29:53,624 --> 00:29:55,558
I wanna be a better person,
you know?

921
00:29:55,592 --> 00:29:57,160
You can't escape.

922
00:29:57,227 --> 00:29:58,895
I had this, uh...

923
00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:01,564
This boyfriend of mine,
many years ago,

924
00:30:01,598 --> 00:30:03,933
That wanted to be
a buddhist.

925
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,636
So he went to asia to visit
some of those monasteries.

926
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,571
Yeah, I thought
about doing that too.

927
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:09,806
Yeah, and you should.
Really?

928
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,773
I'll tell you why.

929
00:30:10,808 --> 00:30:12,508
Uh, he was
quite good-looking,

930
00:30:12,509 --> 00:30:14,143
And each time he went
to one of those monasteries,

931
00:30:14,178 --> 00:30:15,612
A monk offered
to suck his cock.

932
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:16,946
[both laugh]

933
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,115
True story.

934
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:20,917
Well, it all comes down to that,
doesn't it?

935
00:30:20,951 --> 00:30:22,352
Mmm.

936
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:24,587
And I think that's why I
really admire what you're doing.

937
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:25,688
You know?

938
00:30:25,756 --> 00:30:26,923
What do you mean,
sucking cock?

939
00:30:26,957 --> 00:30:27,924
Uh, no!
No?

940
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:28,958
[both laugh]

941
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,493
Wrong answer.
No. Yeah--

942
00:30:30,527 --> 00:30:32,261
No, I was gonna say,
uh...

943
00:30:32,296 --> 00:30:34,364
You know, you're not detached
from life, you know?

944
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:36,866
You've put in your--
passion into action.

945
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:39,469
Well, I try.

946
00:30:39,503 --> 00:30:41,271
Hey, you know something?
What?

947
00:30:41,305 --> 00:30:44,507
I'm gonna be on planes
and, like, in an airport

948
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:46,376
For the next eight hours.
Uh-huh.

949
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:48,878
I'd just love to see
a little bit more of paris.

950
00:30:48,879 --> 00:30:50,546
Would you walk around
with me a little?

951
00:30:50,547 --> 00:30:52,282
Yeah, let's do that.
Do you mind?

952
00:30:52,316 --> 00:30:54,217
No. Let's. Yeah, that's great.
Do you want to?

953
00:30:54,218 --> 00:30:55,818
What do we owe here? 4.50.
Uh--

954
00:30:55,853 --> 00:30:57,387
No, I got it. I got it.
Okay.

955
00:30:57,454 --> 00:30:59,222
I got a little per diem
going on here.

956
00:30:59,223 --> 00:31:00,823
This good for, like,
a tip and everything?

957
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:02,558
Yeah, that's fine.
Yeah?

958
00:31:02,626 --> 00:31:04,294
That's more than enough.
I'll throw that in there too.

959
00:31:04,328 --> 00:31:06,029
All right, is there
anywhere to go around here?

960
00:31:06,063 --> 00:31:07,563
Uh, it's sales day today.

961
00:31:07,564 --> 00:31:08,865
What's that?

962
00:31:08,899 --> 00:31:10,867
It's when everything
is on sale in paris.

963
00:31:10,901 --> 00:31:12,535
It's twice a year.

964
00:31:12,569 --> 00:31:14,070
<i>Au revoir. Merci.
[man speaks french]</i>

965
00:31:14,071 --> 00:31:15,204
<i>Au revoir. Merci.</i>

966
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:16,806
Oh, let's
go shopping.

967
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,541
No, no, no, no.
That's a bad idea.

968
00:31:18,575 --> 00:31:20,043
I don't want
to inflict that on you.

969
00:31:20,077 --> 00:31:21,411
No?
It's madness.

970
00:31:21,478 --> 00:31:22,745
Let's just go
on this garden path.

971
00:31:22,746 --> 00:31:24,414
All right.
It's really nice.

972
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,082
Jesse:
all right. All right.

973
00:31:26,116 --> 00:31:27,650
That sounds better
than shopping, actually.

974
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:29,385
I mean, not that I wouldn't
do whatever you wanted.

975
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,654
You know, sometimes, I don't
even need to buy anything.

976
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:34,223
I just get high on trying on
and looking at things.

977
00:31:34,258 --> 00:31:35,892
You know, a therapist
would tell you--

978
00:31:35,926 --> 00:31:37,527
Is this where we're going?
Yeah.

979
00:31:37,561 --> 00:31:38,695
A therapist would tell you
that's all good.

980
00:31:38,729 --> 00:31:39,896
Really?
Yeah.

981
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,331
Are you ever in therapy?
No.

982
00:31:41,365 --> 00:31:42,999
Jesse:
do I seem like I'm in therapy?

983
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:44,767
Celine:
I'm kidding.

984
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:46,736
Has it helped
your sex problems?

985
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,538
My sex problems?

986
00:31:48,572 --> 00:31:49,739
No, I'm kidding.

987
00:31:49,773 --> 00:31:51,140
Oh, come on.
Tell me the truth.

988
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:52,342
We didn't have
any problems that night.

989
00:31:52,376 --> 00:31:53,543
No, I'm kidding.

990
00:31:53,577 --> 00:31:54,711
We didn't even
have sex anyway.

991
00:31:54,745 --> 00:31:55,578
Wait, that's a joke, right?

992
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:57,013
No, we didn't.

993
00:31:57,047 --> 00:31:58,548
Well, what--?
That was the whole thing.

994
00:31:58,582 --> 00:31:59,816
No, of course we did.

995
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:00,950
No, no, no, no.
We didn't.

996
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,251
You didn't
have a condom,

997
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:03,286
And I never have sex
without one.

998
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,821
Especially
on a one-night thing.

999
00:32:04,855 --> 00:32:05,955
I'm extremely paranoid
about my health.

1000
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,256
There's no way--
whoa, whoa.

1001
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:08,424
I'm finding this scary
that you don't remember.

1002
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:09,759
Why--? No, listen.

1003
00:32:09,793 --> 00:32:11,361
Okay? I didn't write
an entire book,

1004
00:32:11,395 --> 00:32:13,062
[chuckles]
but I kept a journal, okay?

1005
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,731
And I wrote
the whole night in it.

1006
00:32:14,765 --> 00:32:16,866
That's what I meant,
you idealizing the night.

1007
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,368
All right, listen.

1008
00:32:18,402 --> 00:32:20,370
I even remember what brand
of condom we used.

1009
00:32:20,404 --> 00:32:21,938
Okay, that's disgusting.

1010
00:32:21,972 --> 00:32:23,506
I don't want to hear it.
That's not disgusting.

1011
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,941
No.
Well...

1012
00:32:24,975 --> 00:32:26,509
Okay, you know what?

1013
00:32:26,543 --> 00:32:28,411
When I get home,
I'll check my journal from '94,

1014
00:32:28,445 --> 00:32:30,580
But I know I'm right.
All right.

1015
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,251
Wait a minute.
What?

1016
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,486
Was it in the cemetery?

1017
00:32:36,553 --> 00:32:38,221
[scoffs]
no.

1018
00:32:38,255 --> 00:32:40,490
No, we went to the cemetery
in the afternoon.

1019
00:32:40,557 --> 00:32:43,893
It was in the park,
very late at night.

1020
00:32:43,927 --> 00:32:45,395
In the park.
Park...

1021
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:46,629
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
This is...

1022
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:48,998
I can't...
[chuckles]

1023
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:50,633
No, I--
is it that forgettable?

1024
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:51,434
I mean,
you really don't remember?

1025
00:32:51,468 --> 00:32:52,435
In the park.

1026
00:32:52,469 --> 00:32:53,770
Okay, wait a minute.

1027
00:32:53,804 --> 00:32:55,305
I-- I think
you might be right.

1028
00:32:55,339 --> 00:32:56,940
All right. No, you're
messing with me now.

1029
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:58,508
No...
Are you messing with me?

1030
00:32:58,575 --> 00:33:00,310
Okay, no, I'm sorry.
I think you're--

1031
00:33:00,344 --> 00:33:02,145
I mean,
you're right, okay?

1032
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:03,980
Sometime I put things
in drawers inside my head

1033
00:33:04,014 --> 00:33:05,648
And forget about it.

1034
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:07,517
I guess it's less painful
to put certain things away

1035
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,452
Than to live with it.
I'm sorry. It's--

1036
00:33:09,486 --> 00:33:11,521
So that night was
like a sad memory for you?

1037
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:13,623
No, I didn't mean
that night in particular,

1038
00:33:13,657 --> 00:33:15,825
I just meant certain things
are better off forgotten.

1039
00:33:15,859 --> 00:33:18,361
I remember that night
better than I do entire years.

1040
00:33:18,395 --> 00:33:19,462
Me too.

1041
00:33:19,496 --> 00:33:20,530
Really?

1042
00:33:20,564 --> 00:33:22,465
Well, I thought I did...
Uh-huh.

1043
00:33:22,499 --> 00:33:25,101
[both chuckle]

1044
00:33:25,135 --> 00:33:26,402
But maybe I...

1045
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:28,237
Maybe I put it away
because of the fact

1046
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:31,040
That my grandmother's
funeral was the day

1047
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:32,742
We were supposed to
meet again.

1048
00:33:32,776 --> 00:33:34,077
Yeah, right. It was
a tough day for me,

1049
00:33:34,111 --> 00:33:35,478
But it must've been
worse for you.

1050
00:33:35,512 --> 00:33:37,046
It was unreal.

1051
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:39,349
I remember looking at
her dead body in the coffin...

1052
00:33:39,383 --> 00:33:40,650
[sighs]

1053
00:33:40,684 --> 00:33:42,952
...At her beautiful hands,
so warm, so sweet,

1054
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:45,321
That used to
hold me but...

1055
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:48,591
Nothing in that coffin resembled
what I remembered of her.

1056
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,727
All the warmth was gone.

1057
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:52,028
And then I was crying,

1058
00:33:52,062 --> 00:33:53,663
So confused,
if I was crying

1059
00:33:53,697 --> 00:33:54,964
Because I was
never gonna see her again,

1060
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,933
Or never gonna see...

1061
00:33:56,967 --> 00:33:59,068
You again, or...

1062
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:00,603
I'm sorry.
No, it's all right.

1063
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:02,105
I'm sorry to go
on like this.

1064
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:03,740
I've been a little down
this week, I don't know.

1065
00:34:03,774 --> 00:34:05,308
Why?
I don't know. Nothing bad.

1066
00:34:05,342 --> 00:34:06,676
Just, um...

1067
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,711
Reading your book,
maybe?

1068
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,980
No, but thinking
of how hopeful I was

1069
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:12,415
That summer and fall,

1070
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:15,551
And since then
it's been kind of, um...

1071
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:17,020
[sighs]
I don't know.

1072
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:18,321
Memory is
a wonderful thing

1073
00:34:18,355 --> 00:34:19,822
If you don't have to...

1074
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:22,091
Deal with the past.

1075
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,060
[both laugh]
what?

1076
00:34:24,094 --> 00:34:25,662
"memory is
a wonderful thing

1077
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:27,096
If you don't have to
deal with the past."

1078
00:34:27,097 --> 00:34:28,931
Can put that
on a bumper sticker?

1079
00:34:28,932 --> 00:34:30,667
You know, if you wrote
a book about our night,

1080
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:32,268
That'd be a good title.

1081
00:34:32,269 --> 00:34:33,937
Yeah, and it would be
a total different book.

1082
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:36,372
Yeah, there'd be no sex scenes.
[laughs] yeah.

1083
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,674
But you know what?
What?

1084
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,275
Now that we've met again,

1085
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:42,111
We can change our memory
of that December 16th.

1086
00:34:42,112 --> 00:34:43,846
It no longer has
that sad ending

1087
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:45,348
Of us never seeing
each other again, right?

1088
00:34:45,382 --> 00:34:46,783
Yeah, you're right.

1089
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,418
I mean, I guess
a memory's never finished

1090
00:34:48,452 --> 00:34:50,353
As long as you're alive.

1091
00:34:50,387 --> 00:34:52,121
Yeah, I know.
[chuckles]

1092
00:34:52,122 --> 00:34:54,023
I have this memory
from my childhood

1093
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:56,392
That I realized
recently never happened.

1094
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,694
What?
Well...

1095
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:59,462
When I was
eight nor nine,

1096
00:34:59,463 --> 00:35:01,297
My mom was so paranoid
when I was walking home

1097
00:35:01,298 --> 00:35:03,199
From my piano lesson at night,
mm-hmm.

1098
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:04,701
She would always warn me

1099
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:06,102
About dirty old men
giving me candies

1100
00:35:06,136 --> 00:35:07,136
And then showing me
their pee-pees.

1101
00:35:07,204 --> 00:35:08,204
[laughs]

1102
00:35:08,238 --> 00:35:09,706
She was
so obsessed with it

1103
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,574
That later in life,
you know,

1104
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,911
I-- I had this image in my head
that this really happened,

1105
00:35:14,945 --> 00:35:16,980
To the point that
I even associated sex

1106
00:35:17,047 --> 00:35:18,548
With that walk home.

1107
00:35:18,582 --> 00:35:21,484
I mean, and sometimes
even now when I'm...

1108
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:23,152
[laughs]

1109
00:35:23,153 --> 00:35:24,153
When I'm hav...

1110
00:35:24,221 --> 00:35:25,588
When I'm having sex,

1111
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,390
I see myself walking
down that street.

1112
00:35:27,424 --> 00:35:28,491
[laughs]
I swear.

1113
00:35:28,492 --> 00:35:29,659
It's so weird, right?

1114
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:30,893
Well,
is that street nearby?

1115
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:33,096
I mean, could--?
Could we? No.

1116
00:35:33,897 --> 00:35:35,598
Very far.

1117
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:39,502
Did you ever keep a journal
when you were a kid?

1118
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:43,339
Mmm, yeah.
On and off, I guess.

1119
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,008
It's funny.
I read, uh...

1120
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:46,676
One of mine
from '83 the other day.

1121
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:47,777
Yeah.

1122
00:35:47,811 --> 00:35:49,679
And what really
surprised me is

1123
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,849
That I was dealing with life
the same way I am now.

1124
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:54,050
I was much more hopeful

1125
00:35:54,084 --> 00:35:55,618
And naive,
mm-hmm.

1126
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,620
But the core and the way
I was feeling things

1127
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,722
Is exactly the same.
Mmm.

1128
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:01,758
It made me realize
I haven't changed much at all.

1129
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:03,359
Yeah, I don't think
anybody does.

1130
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:04,694
I mean, people don't
wanna admit it,

1131
00:36:04,728 --> 00:36:06,162
But it's, like,
we just--

1132
00:36:06,196 --> 00:36:07,163
We have these innate
set-points, you know,

1133
00:36:07,197 --> 00:36:08,464
Uh-huh.
And it's, like,

1134
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,532
Nothing much
that happens to us

1135
00:36:09,566 --> 00:36:11,501
Changes our disposition.

1136
00:36:11,535 --> 00:36:13,369
Really, you believe that?
I think so.

1137
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:14,938
I read this study
where they followed people

1138
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:16,606
Who'd won the lottery
mm-hmm.

1139
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,174
And people who'd
become paraplegics, right?

1140
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:20,310
I mean, you'd think that,
you know, one extreme

1141
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:23,112
Is gonna make you euphoric
and the other suicidal,

1142
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:25,448
But the study shows
that after about six months,

1143
00:36:25,482 --> 00:36:27,216
Mm-hmm.
Right, it--

1144
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:29,185
As soon as people had gotten
used to their new situation,

1145
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:30,787
Uh, they were
more or less the same.

1146
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,822
The same?
Well-- yeah.

1147
00:36:32,856 --> 00:36:34,290
Like, if they were basically

1148
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,092
An optimistic, jovial person,
mm-hmm.

1149
00:36:36,126 --> 00:36:38,261
They're now an optimistic,
jovialerson in a wheelchair.

1150
00:36:38,295 --> 00:36:40,296
If they're a petty,
miserable asshole,

1151
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,165
Okay, they're a petty,
miserable asshole

1152
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,566
With a new cadillac,
a house and a boat.

1153
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:44,801
[chuckles]

1154
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:46,669
So you mean
I'll be forever depressed

1155
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,037
No matter what great things
happen in my life?

1156
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:49,606
Definitely.
Great.

1157
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,407
No, come on.
Are you depressed now?

1158
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:53,876
No, no,
I'm not depressed...

1159
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,311
But sometimes I worry

1160
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:56,846
That I'll get
to the end of my life,

1161
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,648
Feeling I haven't done
all I wanted to do.

1162
00:36:58,682 --> 00:37:00,183
Well, what do you
want to do?

1163
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:01,184
[sighs]

1164
00:37:01,218 --> 00:37:02,418
I, um...

1165
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:03,686
I want to paint more.

1166
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,321
I want to
play my guitar everyday.

1167
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:06,789
I want to learn chinese.

1168
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:08,658
I want to write more songs.

1169
00:37:08,692 --> 00:37:10,293
There's so many things
I want to do,

1170
00:37:10,327 --> 00:37:11,761
And I end up doing
not much.

1171
00:37:11,795 --> 00:37:14,297
[laughs]

1172
00:37:14,331 --> 00:37:15,965
All right.
Well, let me ask you this.

1173
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,533
Do you believe in, like, uh,
what?

1174
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,236
Ghosts or spirits?

1175
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:21,704
Uh...No.

1176
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,039
No?
No.

1177
00:37:23,073 --> 00:37:25,775
Okay, what about
reincarnation?

1178
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:27,110
Not at all.

1179
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:28,111
God?
No.

1180
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:29,746
[both laugh]

1181
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,414
All right.
That-- that sounds terrible.

1182
00:37:31,448 --> 00:37:32,849
No, no, no,
but at the same time

1183
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:34,584
I don't want to be
one of those people

1184
00:37:34,618 --> 00:37:36,252
That don't believe
in any kind of magic,

1185
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:37,687
You know.
Oh, so then astrology.

1186
00:37:37,721 --> 00:37:39,489
Yes, of course!
There we go.

1187
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:41,090
I mean, that makes sense, right?
Right. Obviously.

1188
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:42,825
I mean, you're a scorpio.
I'm a sag. We get along.

1189
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,594
[both laugh]

1190
00:37:44,628 --> 00:37:46,763
No... No, no.

1191
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:49,666
There's an einstein quote
I really, really like.

1192
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,367
He said,
"if you don't believe

1193
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:53,670
"in any kind of
magic or mystery,

1194
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:55,238
You're basically
as good as dead."

1195
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:56,439
Hmm. Yeah, I like that.
Yeah

1196
00:37:56,473 --> 00:37:58,141
I've always felt
there was

1197
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:00,109
Some kind of mystical core
to the universe, you know,

1198
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:03,046
But more recently,
I've started to think that...

1199
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,347
That me, you know,

1200
00:38:04,381 --> 00:38:05,915
My personality, whatever,
mm-hmm.

1201
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,483
That I don't have
any permanent place here.

1202
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:08,751
Mm-hmm.

1203
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,553
You know, in eternity
or whatever, you know.

1204
00:38:10,587 --> 00:38:12,689
And the more I think that,
I can't go through life,

1205
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:14,657
Saying that this is
no big deal, you know?

1206
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,693
I mean, this is it.
This is actually happening.

1207
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:18,127
What do you think
is interesting?

1208
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:19,495
What do you think
is funny?

1209
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,763
What do you think
is important, you know?

1210
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,166
Every day is our last.
[chuckles]

1211
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,168
When I feel that way,
I usually call my mom

1212
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:26,769
To tell her
how much I love her...

1213
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,571
Yeah?
And she's always,

1214
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:30,907
"are you okay?
Do you have cancer?

1215
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:32,942
[laughs]
are you gonna commit suicide?"

1216
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,811
It's almost
not worth it.

1217
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,880
So, uh...

1218
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:39,782
So, what about us?

1219
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,217
What about us?
Look, I...

1220
00:38:41,251 --> 00:38:42,785
What I mean is,
um...

1221
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,187
If we were both
going to die tonight--

1222
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:45,688
What, like,
if the apocalypse was coming?

1223
00:38:45,689 --> 00:38:46,990
No, no,
that's too dramatic,

1224
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:48,424
But what if, you know,

1225
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,159
Just the two of us
were going to die?

1226
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:51,461
I mean...
Hmmm.

1227
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,695
Would we talk
about your book,

1228
00:38:52,696 --> 00:38:54,364
The environment, or...?

1229
00:38:54,431 --> 00:38:55,865
If today
was our last day.

1230
00:38:55,899 --> 00:38:57,233
Yeah, what would
we talk about?

1231
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:58,201
What would you tell me,
for example?

1232
00:38:58,202 --> 00:38:59,369
Well...

1233
00:38:59,436 --> 00:39:00,536
That's hard, huh?

1234
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:02,071
No, well--
no, I'll do it.

1235
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:03,940
I definitely would stop
talking about my book.

1236
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:05,441
Okay.
I have to admit

1237
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:06,276
I would probably
drop the environment.

1238
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,710
Okay.

1239
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,646
But I would still 'ih6twant to
talk about, you know,

1240
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:11,281
The magic in the universe.
Mm-hmm.

1241
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:13,449
I'd just want to
do it from a...

1242
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:14,584
What?

1243
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:16,286
A hotel room, you know,

1244
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,156
In between sessions of us
wildly fucking until we die.

1245
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:21,324
Wow.

1246
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:23,393
Well, why waste time
with an hotel room?

1247
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:25,795
Why not do it
right there on a bench?

1248
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:26,796
Okay, come on.

1249
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:27,997
No!
Come here.

1250
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:29,098
Come here. Come here.
No!

1251
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:30,133
[laughs]

1252
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:31,167
Okay.

1253
00:39:31,201 --> 00:39:32,635
We're not gonna
die tonight.

1254
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,903
All right. Too bad.
Okay?

1255
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:35,138
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

1256
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:36,406
That was
an extreme example.

1257
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,008
I was-- okay.
I'm sorry.

1258
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:40,677
What I--
my point was, you know,

1259
00:39:40,744 --> 00:39:42,679
To truly communicate
with people

1260
00:39:42,746 --> 00:39:44,013
Is very hard to do.

1261
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:45,949
No, I know, I mean,
most of our...

1262
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:47,317
Most of our day-to-day
exchanges--

1263
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:48,584
Yeah, I know. I mean,

1264
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,520
Not to bring everything
back to sex, but--

1265
00:39:50,587 --> 00:39:51,921
But why not?
No, no.

1266
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,256
This example,
this friend of mine,

1267
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,824
She was talking about

1268
00:39:54,858 --> 00:39:56,459
She and her boyfriend,

1269
00:39:56,493 --> 00:39:58,127
Problems in bed...
Right.

1270
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,263
And how when they had
been dating for a year,

1271
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:01,698
She started telling him

1272
00:40:01,765 --> 00:40:03,299
What he could do
to please her more,

1273
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:04,767
And it totally freaked him out.

1274
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:05,935
Why?
Totally.

1275
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,537
Well, he felt all threatened.

1276
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:09,205
And he thought it meant
he was a bad lover...

1277
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:10,773
Maybe she shouldn't have
waited so long,

1278
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:12,008
After a year.
Well, yeah,

1279
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,209
But men are
so easily offended.

1280
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:14,544
Oh, what, more than women,
you think?

1281
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,179
Oh. Definitely
on that subject.

1282
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:17,313
You think so?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1283
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:18,381
Hmm.

1284
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:20,283
Well, maybe it's because,
you know...

1285
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:23,319
Men are easier to,
you know...

1286
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:24,654
To please.
To please?

1287
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:25,488
Well, I don't know.
Yeah.

1288
00:40:25,522 --> 00:40:26,522
Yeah, they are.

1289
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,057
They definitely--
definitely.

1290
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:29,525
Anyway, this friend of mine,
she was telling me

1291
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,861
That, um, next time
she dates another man,

1292
00:40:31,895 --> 00:40:33,730
She's gonna make
a little questionnaire

1293
00:40:33,797 --> 00:40:35,665
About what they like
and dislike before they--

1294
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,400
What, like, written down
or out loud?

1295
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:39,402
Yeah, yeah, written down.
Mostly written down...

1296
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,838
But it wouldn't be
just, you know, yes or no.

1297
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:43,740
It would be a bit more
complex than that.

1298
00:40:43,807 --> 00:40:45,241
Like what?
For example, if the question is...

1299
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:46,709
"are you into s and m?"

1300
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,011
Uh, the answer could be,

1301
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:49,412
"no, but...

1302
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:51,914
A good spanking
once in a while doesn't hurt."

1303
00:40:51,915 --> 00:40:53,416
Right?
Right, or like, what,

1304
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:55,051
"do you--?
So do you like

1305
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:56,653
Talking dirty in bed,"
that kind of thing?

1306
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:59,188
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but not
just like any dirty talk.

1307
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:00,857
Mm-hmm.
Just like, "what specific word

1308
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:02,025
Would you like to hear,"
you know?

1309
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:03,326
Right. What, me?
Well, yeah.

1310
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,827
Like, for example, like,

1311
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:06,162
What specific word
would you like to hear?

1312
00:41:06,196 --> 00:41:07,697
I don't know.

1313
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:09,399
Um...

1314
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:12,101
What do you feel
about the word "pussy"?

1315
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:14,938
I...Love it.

1316
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:15,939
Good.

1317
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:17,273
[laughs]

1318
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:19,042
It's azing
what perverts we've become

1319
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,576
I know. I know.
In the past nine years.

1320
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,779
Well, at least now
we don't have to pretend

1321
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,181
That each new sexual experience
is, like, a life-altering event.

1322
00:41:25,215 --> 00:41:26,516
I know, by now I know

1323
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,084
You've stuck it
in so many places,

1324
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:29,185
It's, like,
about to fall off, right?

1325
00:41:29,219 --> 00:41:30,620
Mmm, yeah, you know,

1326
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:32,288
I can't realistically expect
u've become

1327
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:33,556
Anything but a total ho
at this point, you know.

1328
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,624
Yeah, thank you.
[laughs]

1329
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:37,126
No, I'm s--

1330
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:38,628
That's true.
What can you do?

1331
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,396
Hmm? What can you do?

1332
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:41,798
So...
[clears throat]

1333
00:41:41,865 --> 00:41:43,299
What kind of songs
do you write?

1334
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:44,567
I didn't know
you did that.

1335
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:45,868
What kind?
Yeah, sure.

1336
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:47,303
I don't know, just songs.
Like--

1337
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:49,806
Like, some are about,
you know, people.

1338
00:41:49,873 --> 00:41:51,941
Uh... Relationships.
One's about my cat.

1339
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:53,543
Sing one. Just--
no, I can't.

1340
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:55,445
I don't have a guitar.
Oh, I mean, come on.

1341
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:57,213
No, no, no.
A cappella.

1342
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:00,249
I'm not singing a song
without a guitar. You're nuts.

1343
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:01,618
Why not?
[laughs]

1344
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:03,086
Just...One.
No, okay.

1345
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,487
Not now, no.

1346
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:06,155
If not now, when?

1347
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:08,224
What, you want to meet here
in six months with a guitar?

1348
00:42:08,258 --> 00:42:09,993
You know, I'll fly
all the way over here.

1349
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,728
You may or may not
make the métro.

1350
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:13,529
That's funny. Yeah, there's no--
okay.

1351
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:15,231
We've gotta get going
back to the bookstore.

1352
00:42:15,265 --> 00:42:16,766
We'll be fine.
You're gonna miss your flight.

1353
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,067
All right, all right.
Come on, let's go.

1354
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:19,335
We can walk down la seine.

1355
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:22,105
It's a nice thing.
Okay.

1356
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:23,539
So you're flying
back to new york?

1357
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,275
Yeah, yeah.

1358
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:29,178
So I read
in that article

1359
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,480
That you're
married with a kid.

1360
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:31,814
That's great.

1361
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:33,349
Yeah, he's--

1362
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,550
He's four.

1363
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:35,718
Uh-huh.
What's his name?

1364
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:37,053
Henry. Little hank.

1365
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:38,154
He's so much fun.

1366
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:39,856
Oh, wow. I'm sure.

1367
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,424
And your wife?
What does she do?

1368
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,892
She teaches
elementary school.

1369
00:42:42,926 --> 00:42:44,494
Do you--?
Do you have kids?

1370
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:45,528
Yes, two.

1371
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:47,030
Shit!
What?

1372
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:48,865
I left them in the car,
with the windows up!

1373
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:50,767
It was six months ago.
Do you think they're okay?

1374
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:52,335
[laughs]
no, I'm kidding.

1375
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:53,670
No, but I want to
have kids some day.

1376
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:55,371
I'm just not ready yet.
Yeah?

1377
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:57,006
Yeah, I'm in a good
relationship, though.

1378
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,608
Oh, yeah? That's good.
Yeah.

1379
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:00,043
What's he do?

1380
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,945
He's a photojournalist.
He does war coverage.

1381
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:03,179
Oh, he away a lot,

1382
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:04,714
Which, in a way,
is good for me

1383
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:05,982
Because I'm so busy.

1384
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:07,383
Yeah, but isn't
that dangerous?

1385
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:08,484
I mean, aren't
a lot of those guys

1386
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:10,053
Getting killed
these days?

1387
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:12,322
He promises me
he doesn't take risks,

1388
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:13,356
But I often worry.

1389
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:14,791
He goes into this trance

1390
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:16,059
When he starts
to photograph something.

1391
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,360
What do you mean?

1392
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:19,495
Well, once we were
in new delhi,

1393
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:21,297
And we passed a bum
that was lying down--

1394
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:22,298
A bomb?

1395
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:23,399
A bum.
A bum.

1396
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,601
A homeless.
[laughs]

1397
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:26,035
All right,
all right.

1398
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,570
Anyway, like, he looked
like he needed help,

1399
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,272
But his first reaction
was to photograph him.

1400
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:31,207
He went, like,
really close to his face,

1401
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:32,875
Fixing his collar
to make it look better.

1402
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,544
He was, like, totally detached
from the person.

1403
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:36,279
Yeah, but don't you kind of
have to be like that

1404
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:37,614
To be good at that job?

1405
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:39,182
Yeah, I mean, I'm not,
you know,

1406
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:40,750
I'm not judging him for it,
you know?

1407
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:42,452
What he does
is essential and incredible.

1408
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:43,886
All I'm saying is
that I could never do it.

1409
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,121
Yeah, let's get
on that boat.

1410
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:46,522
Come on.
No!

1411
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:48,391
No, come on. It'll be fun.
You don't have time.

1412
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:50,259
It looks like they're
about to take off.

1413
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,694
Look, I've got--
I've got 15 more minutes.

1414
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:53,029
Do you have a cell phone?
Yeah.

1415
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:54,764
All right,
well, look.

1416
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,566
I got that driver guy's number,
and I can call him,

1417
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,368
Okay.
And then they can pick us up

1418
00:43:58,402 --> 00:43:59,969
At whatever the next stop is.
You know what?

1419
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:01,604
I've never
been on those boats.

1420
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,805
It's for tourists.
It's embarrassing.

1421
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,573
Come on.
Okay, all right.

1422
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:05,942
[both speaking french]

1423
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,377
No, I'll get it.
I'll get it.

1424
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:09,012
[celine speaks french]

1425
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:11,648
All right.
All right, all right.

1426
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:14,550
[celine speaks french]

1427
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:16,019
Thank you.
[speaks french]

1428
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,487
So are you in love
with that guy?

1429
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:18,554
What guy?

1430
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,323
<i>The war photographer.
Merci.</i>

1431
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:21,457
Yes, of course.

1432
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,759
<i>Your change.
Bon voyage.</i>

1433
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:23,793
<i>Merci.</i>

1434
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:28,064
Um, so do you--? Do you
have that cell phone?

1435
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:29,799
Oh, yeah.

1436
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:30,800
Okay, let's see.

1437
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:31,968
Okay.

1438
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:33,903
All right,
what do I tell him?

1439
00:44:33,938 --> 00:44:35,805
<i>Yeah, tell him to pick you up
at quai henri quatre.</i>

1440
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:38,808
<i>Oh, shit. Uh, qu-quai...</i>

1441
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:41,411
<i>Henri quatre.
Quai henri quatre.</i>

1442
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:42,445
<i>Henri quatre.</i>

1443
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:43,813
<i>Hen--
[both laugh]</i>

1444
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:45,315
What's wrong with you?

1445
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:46,983
<i>No, do you want me to--?
Henri quatre.</i>

1446
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:48,718
Henry four?
Yes!

1447
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:51,654
Come on, why didn't you say so?
I'm sorry, okay.

1448
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:54,757
[dialing phone]

1449
00:44:57,795 --> 00:44:59,662
[engine powering up]

1450
00:45:03,601 --> 00:45:05,935
Uh, yeah.
Is this philippe?

1451
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:08,972
Yeah. Philippe,
this is jesse wallace.

1452
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:10,173
Yeah.

1453
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:11,574
No, well, listen, I'm--

1454
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:13,676
I'm on one
of those boats, right?

1455
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:16,546
Um, and we're gonna
arrive at--

1456
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,880
At henry four,

1457
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:19,616
At port henry four.

1458
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,284
You know what--?
You know what that is?

1459
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:22,518
All right, great.

1460
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:23,987
And you have my bags,
right?

1461
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:25,521
Yeah, so we'll
be there in...

1462
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:26,990
I don't know,
it's the next stop.

1463
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:30,493
<i>Okay. Au revoir.</i>

1464
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:33,029
Okay?
Yeah, yeah.

1465
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,164
Oh, wow.

1466
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:37,133
Notre dame, man,
check that out.

1467
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:38,167
Oh, wow.

1468
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:39,869
I heard this story once

1469
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:42,238
About when the germans
were occupying paris,

1470
00:45:42,273 --> 00:45:44,140
And they had
to retreat back.

1471
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,276
They wired
notre dame to blow,

1472
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:47,543
But they had to--

1473
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,012
They had to leave one guy

1474
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:50,780
In charge
of hitting the switch.

1475
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:52,715
And the guy,
the soldier, he--

1476
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,150
He couldn't do it.

1477
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:55,718
You know, he just
sat there knocked out

1478
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,987
By how beautiful
the place was...

1479
00:45:58,022 --> 00:46:00,023
And then when
the allied troops came in,

1480
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:02,292
They found all the explosives
just lying there,

1481
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:03,559
And the switch unturned.

1482
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,128
And they found
the same thing

1483
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:07,463
At the sacré-coeur,
eiffel tower...

1484
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:09,699
A couple other places,
I think.

1485
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:12,101
Is that true?

1486
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:13,569
I don't know.

1487
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,204
I always liked
the story, though.

1488
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:16,839
Yeah, that's
a great story.

1489
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:18,241
But you have to think

1490
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:19,876
That notre dame will
be gone one day.

1491
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,311
There used to
be another church

1492
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:22,712
Or cathedral at the seine.

1493
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:24,580
Right there.
What, right in the same spot?

1494
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,249
Yeah.

1495
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,750
Hmm.

1496
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:29,018
Yeah, this is great.

1497
00:46:29,053 --> 00:46:30,153
I've never done this.

1498
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:31,354
Yeah.

1499
00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:33,089
I forget about
how beautiful paris is.

1500
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,691
This isn't so bad,
being a tourist, huh?

1501
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:36,159
Thank you for getting me
on the boat.

1502
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:37,593
Oh, you're welcome.

1503
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:39,095
You know, I think
that book that I wrote,

1504
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,596
In a way, was like
building something

1505
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:42,231
So that
I wouldn't forget

1506
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:45,201
The details of the time
that we spent together.

1507
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:47,537
You know, like,
just as a reminder that...

1508
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:49,439
That once we really did meet.

1509
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:52,609
You know, that this was real.
This happened.

1510
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:54,444
I'm happy you're saying that,
because--

1511
00:46:54,445 --> 00:46:56,245
I mean, I always feel
like a freak

1512
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,780
Because I'm never able
to move on like this:

1513
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:58,915
You know?

1514
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:01,150
People just
have an affair

1515
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:03,319
Or even
entire relationships.

1516
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:05,455
They break up
and they forget.

1517
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:09,025
They move on like they would've
changed brand of cereals.

1518
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,730
I feel I was never able
to forget anyone I've been with,

1519
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:17,600
Because each person had
their own...

1520
00:47:17,635 --> 00:47:19,702
Specific qualities.

1521
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:21,804
You can never
replace anyone.

1522
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:24,107
What is lost is lost.

1523
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:27,977
Each relationship,
when it ends really damages me.

1524
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:29,812
I never fully recover.

1525
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:33,316
That's why I'm very careful with
getting involved because...

1526
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:35,218
It hurts too much.

1527
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:36,819
Even getting laid.

1528
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:39,055
[laughs]
I actually don't do that because...

1529
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:41,824
I will miss of the person
the most mundane things.

1530
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:44,761
Like, I'm obsessed
with little things.

1531
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:47,297
Maybe I'm crazy,
but...When I was a little girl,

1532
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:50,300
My mom told me that I was
always late to school.

1533
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:53,102
One day she followed me
to see why.

1534
00:47:53,137 --> 00:47:56,472
I was looking at chestnuts
falling from the trees,

1535
00:47:56,507 --> 00:47:57,674
Rolling on the sidewalk,

1536
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,276
Or ants crossing the road,

1537
00:48:00,311 --> 00:48:02,946
The way a leaf cast a shadow
on a tree trunk.

1538
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,213
Little things.

1539
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:08,051
I think it's
the same with people.

1540
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:09,919
I see in them
little details,

1541
00:48:09,954 --> 00:48:11,421
So specific
to each of them,

1542
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:12,822
That move me,
and that I miss

1543
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:15,692
And will always miss.

1544
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:17,660
You can never replace anyone,

1545
00:48:17,695 --> 00:48:21,064
Because everyone is made of such
beautiful, specific details.

1546
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:26,369
Like I remember the way

1547
00:48:26,437 --> 00:48:28,338
Your beard has
a bit of red in it,

1548
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:31,708
And how the sun was
making it glow that...

1549
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:35,378
That morning
right before you left.

1550
00:48:35,446 --> 00:48:39,582
I remembered that,
and I missed it.

1551
00:48:39,617 --> 00:48:41,084
Really crazy, right?

1552
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:42,952
All right,
now I know for sure.

1553
00:48:42,987 --> 00:48:45,622
You wanna know why
I wrote that stupid book?

1554
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:47,223
Why?
So that you might

1555
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,758
Come to a reading
in paris,

1556
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:50,560
And I could walk up to you
and ask,

1557
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,495
"where the fuck were you?"

1558
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:53,763
[chuckles]

1559
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:55,765
No, you think
I'd be here today?

1560
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:57,333
I'm serious.
I think I...

1561
00:48:57,368 --> 00:49:00,470
I wrote it in a way
to try to find you.

1562
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:02,505
Okay, that's--
I know that's not true,

1563
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:03,906
But that's sweet of you
to say.

1564
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:05,341
Well, I think
it is true.

1565
00:49:05,376 --> 00:49:06,709
What do you think
the chances were

1566
00:49:06,744 --> 00:49:08,211
Of us ever meeting again?

1567
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:12,181
After that December,
I'd say almost zero.

1568
00:49:12,216 --> 00:49:14,384
But we're not real anyway,
right?

1569
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:17,820
We're just characters
in that old lady's dream.

1570
00:49:17,855 --> 00:49:20,023
She's on her deathbed
fantasizing about her youth,

1571
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:21,758
So of course
we had to meet again.

1572
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:24,527
[groans]
oh, god.

1573
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:26,663
Why weren't you there in vienna?

1574
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,599
I told you why.

1575
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,534
Yeah, I know why,
I just...

1576
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:33,937
I wish you would have been.

1577
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:36,539
Our lives might have been
so much different.

1578
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:39,075
[quietly] you know?
Do you think so?

1579
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:40,643
I actually do.

1580
00:49:40,678 --> 00:49:42,045
Maybe not.

1581
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,980
Maybe we would have
hated each other eventually.

1582
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:46,215
Oh, what, like we hate
each other now?

1583
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:50,253
You know,
maybe we're...

1584
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:52,588
We're only good
at brief encounters

1585
00:49:52,623 --> 00:49:54,590
Walking around
in european cities,

1586
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:55,959
In warm climate.

1587
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:57,460
[chuckles]

1588
00:49:57,528 --> 00:50:00,730
Oh, god. Why didn't we exchange
phone numbers and stuff?

1589
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:02,966
Why didn't we do that?

1590
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:05,435
Because we were
young and stupid.

1591
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:07,904
Do you think we still are?

1592
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:10,473
I guess when you're young,
you just believe

1593
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:12,976
There will be many people
with whom you'll connect with,

1594
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,878
And later in life, you realize
it only happens a few times.

1595
00:50:15,913 --> 00:50:17,680
Yeah, and you can
screw it up.

1596
00:50:17,715 --> 00:50:19,949
You know, misconnect.

1597
00:50:19,984 --> 00:50:21,384
Well, the past
is the past.

1598
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:22,685
It was meant
to be that way.

1599
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,953
What, you really
believe that,

1600
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:25,321
That everything's fated?

1601
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,090
Well...You know,

1602
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:29,425
The world might be
less free than we think.

1603
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,661
Yeah?

1604
00:50:31,662 --> 00:50:34,197
Yeah, when given
these exact circumstances,

1605
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:35,865
That's what will
happen every time.

1606
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:37,767
Two part hydrogen,
one part oxygen,

1607
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:38,968
You'll get water
every time.

1608
00:50:39,003 --> 00:50:40,503
No, no, no. I mean,

1609
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,739
What if your grandmother had
lived a week longer, you know,

1610
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:45,375
Or passed away a week earlier,
days, even, you know?

1611
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:47,310
Things might've been different.
I believe that.

1612
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:49,012
No, you can't think
like that, it's--

1613
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,414
No. I mean, I know you shouldn't
on most things, but...

1614
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:53,016
It's just it...

1615
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,151
On this one, it seemed like
something was off, you know?

1616
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:56,919
I mean...

1617
00:50:56,954 --> 00:50:59,122
In the months leading up
to my wedding, okay,

1618
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:00,790
I was thinking abo.

1619
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:02,191
I mean,
even on my way there,

1620
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:03,526
I'm in the car,

1621
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:05,261
And a buddy of mine
is driving me downtown,

1622
00:51:05,296 --> 00:51:06,529
And I'm staring
out the window.

1623
00:51:06,597 --> 00:51:07,997
And I think I see you

1624
00:51:08,032 --> 00:51:10,199
Not far from
the church, right,

1625
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:12,702
Folding up an umbrella
and walking into a deli

1626
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:16,773
On the corner
of 13th and broadway...

1627
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,574
And I thought I was
going crazy, you know,

1628
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:20,343
But now I think
it probably was you.

1629
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:24,547
I lived on
11th and broadway.

1630
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:26,616
[softly]
you see?

1631
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:27,784
[inhales]

1632
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:29,452
So...What is it like
to be married?

1633
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:31,487
You haven't talked much
about that.

1634
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:33,723
I haven't?

1635
00:51:33,724 --> 00:51:35,959
How weird.

1636
00:51:35,993 --> 00:51:38,227
I don't know.
We met...

1637
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:40,330
You know,
when I was in college.

1638
00:51:40,364 --> 00:51:42,398
And, uh, we broke up,

1639
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:44,500
And got back together
for a period of years,

1640
00:51:44,535 --> 00:51:47,570
And then, um...

1641
00:51:47,638 --> 00:51:49,539
What, we were
sort of back together,

1642
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:51,407
And she was pregnant...

1643
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:54,110
So marriage.

1644
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:55,244
What is she like?

1645
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:59,115
She's a great teacher,
a good mom.

1646
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:02,819
Uh, she's smart, pretty,
you know?

1647
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:04,821
I remember thinking
at the time

1648
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:07,490
That...So many of the men
that I admired most, you know,

1649
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:09,626
That their lives were...

1650
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:12,562
Were dedicated to something
greater than themselves.

1651
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:14,197
So you got married

1652
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:16,032
Because men you admired
were married?

1653
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:18,101
No, no, no. It...

1654
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:22,538
It's more like I had this idea
of my best self, you know,

1655
00:52:22,573 --> 00:52:24,440
And I wanted
to pursue that,

1656
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:27,310
Even if it might've been
overriding my honest self.

1657
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:29,112
Do you know
what I'm saying?

1658
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:30,647
I mean,
it's funny, like,

1659
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:32,215
In the moment
I remember thinking

1660
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:33,750
That it didn't much matter
the who of it all.

1661
00:52:33,784 --> 00:52:35,885
I mean, that nobody
is gonna be everything to you,

1662
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:37,587
And that ultimately

1663
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:39,689
It's just the simple action of
committing yourself, you know,

1664
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:42,925
Meeting your responsibilities,
that matters.

1665
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,494
I mean,
what is love, right,

1666
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:46,963
If it's not respect,
trust, admiration?

1667
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:50,166
And I-- I felt
all those things.

1668
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,901
So cut to
the present tense,

1669
00:52:51,936 --> 00:52:53,303
And I feel like
I'm running a small nursery

1670
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:55,872
With somebody
I used to da, you know?

1671
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:58,107
I mean, I'm like a monk,
you know?

1672
00:52:58,142 --> 00:52:59,876
I mean, I've had sex
less than...

1673
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,245
10 times
in the last four years.

1674
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:03,479
[laughs]

1675
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:05,615
What? What, what?
You laughing at me?

1676
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:07,250
No.
It sounds pathetic?

1677
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:09,652
What monastery do the monk
have sex 10 times?

1678
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:11,354
Okay, you're right.
[laughs]

1679
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:12,922
I'm doing better
than most monks, all right.

1680
00:53:12,957 --> 00:53:15,024
But I do. I feel like
if somebody were to touch me,

1681
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:17,727
You know, I would dissolve
into molecules.

1682
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:19,495
Well, we're here.
We've gotta go.

1683
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:20,663
Come on.

1684
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:21,698
Shit.

1685
00:53:24,101 --> 00:53:25,802
[speaking french]

1686
00:53:27,972 --> 00:53:28,938
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

1687
00:53:28,973 --> 00:53:29,939
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

1688
00:53:29,974 --> 00:53:31,307
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

1689
00:53:32,843 --> 00:53:34,911
Oh, sacré-coeur.

1690
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:37,413
I'm sorry to hear that,
what?

1691
00:53:37,448 --> 00:53:41,317
You know, you're not that
happy with your marriage.

1692
00:53:41,352 --> 00:53:43,286
Well, this friend of mine,
she's a shrink and--

1693
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,921
Yeah, how's she doing?
She's a mess, but--

1694
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:46,022
[both laugh]

1695
00:53:46,023 --> 00:53:47,523
No, she was telling me

1696
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:49,359
That she's been dealing
with a lot of couples

1697
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:50,994
That are breaking up
for the same exact reason.

1698
00:53:51,028 --> 00:53:52,462
Mmm, what reason
is that?

1699
00:53:52,496 --> 00:53:53,596
Well, all
those couples expected

1700
00:53:53,631 --> 00:53:54,931
After a few years
of living together

1701
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:56,366
For the passion, that consuming
desire, to be the same

1702
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:57,934
Than in the beginning.
Yeah, right.

1703
00:53:57,968 --> 00:53:58,801
It's impossible.
No, I know that.

1704
00:53:58,836 --> 00:54:00,270
And thank god!

1705
00:54:00,304 --> 00:54:02,038
Otherwise we would end up
with aneurysms if we were

1706
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:04,040
In that constant state
of excitement, right?

1707
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:06,242
We would end up doing nothing
at all with our lives.

1708
00:54:06,277 --> 00:54:08,244
Do you think you would
have finished your book

1709
00:54:08,279 --> 00:54:09,946
If you were fucking
someone every five minutes?

1710
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,114
I might have
welcomed the challenge.

1711
00:54:11,148 --> 00:54:12,582
No...
[both laugh]

1712
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:14,317
But, you know,
it's natural for your wife

1713
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:15,885
After the birth of your son.
No.

1714
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,253
She has to giveall her love

1715
00:54:17,288 --> 00:54:18,955
To the little one.
Of course.

1716
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:20,123
Imagine if she was
totally obsessed with sex,

1717
00:54:20,157 --> 00:54:21,591
Riding you
like a wild cat.

1718
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:22,659
That wouldn't make
any sense, right?

1719
00:54:22,693 --> 00:54:23,960
No, no. It wo--

1720
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:25,428
Everything you're
saying makes sense.

1721
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:27,030
It's--
it's not about sex.

1722
00:54:27,064 --> 00:54:29,666
No, I know.
It's obvious.

1723
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,068
I, um...

1724
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:35,471
You know, couples
are so confused lately.

1725
00:54:35,506 --> 00:54:38,041
I think
it must be that...

1726
00:54:38,075 --> 00:54:42,345
Men need to feel essential,
and they don't anymore.

1727
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:43,780
Because it's been
imprinted in their head

1728
00:54:43,814 --> 00:54:45,048
For so many years

1729
00:54:45,082 --> 00:54:46,916
That they have
to be the provider.

1730
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:49,285
Like, I-- I'm a strong,
independent woman

1731
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,820
In my professional life.
Really?

1732
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:52,422
I don't need a man
to feed me,

1733
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:54,223
But I still need a man
to love me

1734
00:54:54,258 --> 00:54:56,826
And that I could love,
you know?

1735
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:58,061
So, uh...

1736
00:54:58,095 --> 00:55:00,029
Your driver's here.
Yeah.

1737
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,798
Well, I guess
this is goodbye.

1738
00:55:01,832 --> 00:55:03,399
You better give me your--

1739
00:55:03,434 --> 00:55:05,101
No, why don't we just
give you a ride home,

1740
00:55:05,102 --> 00:55:06,569
Wherever you're going, huh?

1741
00:55:06,604 --> 00:55:07,837
Well, I can take
the métro. I'm fine.

1742
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:09,205
No, no, no, no, no.

1743
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:10,773
My flight's
not until 10:00, right?

1744
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:12,342
They've got me arriving
two hours early.

1745
00:55:12,376 --> 00:55:13,843
It's not really--
this way we can keep talking.

1746
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:15,378
No, no. Monsieur?
It's not really on the way.

1747
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:17,113
Can...?
[speaks french]

1748
00:55:18,616 --> 00:55:21,117
<i>Oui.
[speaks french]</i>

1749
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,152
[both speaking french]

1750
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,295
So you told him where you are,
and all that jazz?

1751
00:55:32,363 --> 00:55:33,296
Yeah.

1752
00:55:33,364 --> 00:55:34,631
[celine speaks french]

1753
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:35,698
[engine starts]

1754
00:55:38,202 --> 00:55:40,036
So he knows where he's going?
Yes.

1755
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:41,037
Glad somebody does.

1756
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:42,405
[chuckles]

1757
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:44,040
No, but this is better
than the métro, right?

1758
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:45,775
Definitely.

1759
00:55:48,646 --> 00:55:50,446
I was thinking,
for me it's better

1760
00:55:50,481 --> 00:55:53,149
I don't romanticize things
as much anymore.

1761
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:55,218
I was suffering so much
all the time.

1762
00:55:55,252 --> 00:55:56,953
I still have
lots of dreams,

1763
00:55:56,987 --> 00:55:58,821
But they're not in regard
to my love life.

1764
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:01,324
It doe't make me sad.
It's just the way it is.

1765
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,059
Is that why you're in
a relationship

1766
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:04,661
With somebody
who's never around?

1767
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:05,762
[chuckles]

1768
00:56:05,796 --> 00:56:07,363
Yes, obviously I can't deal

1769
00:56:07,398 --> 00:56:09,432
With the day-to-day life
of a relationship.

1770
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:11,935
Yeah, we have, you know,
this exciting time together,

1771
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:13,636
And then he leaves,
and I miss him,

1772
00:56:13,671 --> 00:56:15,405
But at least
I'm not dying inside.

1773
00:56:15,439 --> 00:56:16,806
When someone
is always around me,

1774
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,441
I'm, like, suffocating.

1775
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:21,110
No, wait. You just said that
you need to love and be loved.

1776
00:56:21,145 --> 00:56:23,479
Yeah, but when I do, it
quickly makes me nauseous.

1777
00:56:23,514 --> 00:56:25,782
[laughs]
it's a disaster.

1778
00:56:25,816 --> 00:56:28,718
I mean, I'm really happy
only when I'm on my own.

1779
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:31,554
Even being alone,
it's better than...

1780
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:33,823
Sitting next to a lover
and feeling lonely.

1781
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:35,625
It's not so easy
for me

1782
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:37,727
To be a romantic.
You start off that way,

1783
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:40,129
And after you've been
screwed over a few times,

1784
00:56:40,164 --> 00:56:42,365
You-- you forget about
all your delusional ideas,

1785
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,567
And you just take
what comes into your life.

1786
00:56:44,602 --> 00:56:46,002
That's not even true.

1787
00:56:46,036 --> 00:56:47,737
I haven't been
screwed over.

1788
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:50,206
I've just had too many
"blah" relationship.

1789
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,207
They weren't mean.

1790
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,742
They cared for me,

1791
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:56,245
But there were no real
connection or excitement.

1792
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,448
At least,
not from my side.

1793
00:56:58,482 --> 00:57:01,351
God, I'm sorry. Is it--?
Is it really that bad?

1794
00:57:01,385 --> 00:57:02,552
It's not, right?

1795
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:05,755
You know...

1796
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:06,789
It's not even that.

1797
00:57:06,824 --> 00:57:08,758
I was-- I was fine...

1798
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:10,727
Until I read your fucking book.

1799
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:12,895
It stirred shit up,
you know?

1800
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:15,865
It reminded me
how genuinely romantic I was,

1801
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:17,467
How I had so much hope
in things,

1802
00:57:17,501 --> 00:57:20,036
And now it's like...

1803
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:22,071
I don't believe in anything
that relates to love.

1804
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:24,040
I don't feel things
for people anymore.

1805
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:26,409
In a way...

1806
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,978
I put all my romanticism
into that one night,

1807
00:57:29,013 --> 00:57:30,246
And I was never able

1808
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:32,248
To feel all this again.
Hey.

1809
00:57:32,283 --> 00:57:34,517
Like, somehow this night
took things away from me,

1810
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:36,819
And I exprsed them to you,
and you took them with you.

1811
00:57:36,854 --> 00:57:39,088
It made me feel cold,
like if love wasn't for me.

1812
00:57:39,123 --> 00:57:40,556
No, no.
I don't believe that.

1813
00:57:40,591 --> 00:57:41,758
[sighs]
I don't believe that.

1814
00:57:42,993 --> 00:57:44,427
You know what?

1815
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:47,096
Reality and love
are almost contradictory for me.

1816
00:57:47,164 --> 00:57:48,698
It's funny.

1817
00:57:48,732 --> 00:57:51,834
Every single of my exes,
they're now married.

1818
00:57:51,869 --> 00:57:53,536
Men go out with me,
we break up,

1819
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,238
And then they get married,
[chuckles]

1820
00:57:55,272 --> 00:57:56,606
And later they call me
to thank me

1821
00:57:56,674 --> 00:57:58,508
For teaching them what love is,
oh, god...

1822
00:57:58,542 --> 00:58:00,543
And that I taught them
to care and respect women.

1823
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:02,211
Yeah. I think I'm
one of those guys.

1824
00:58:02,246 --> 00:58:03,780
You know,
I want to kill them!

1825
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:05,915
Why didn't they ask me
to marry them?

1826
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:07,717
I would have said no, but
at least they could've asked.

1827
00:58:07,751 --> 00:58:09,786
But it's my fault.
I know it's my fault

1828
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:11,621
Because I never felt
it was the right man,

1829
00:58:11,622 --> 00:58:13,723
Never!
But what does it mean,

1830
00:58:13,757 --> 00:58:16,192
The right man, the love of your
life? The concept is absurd.

1831
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:18,461
The idea that we can only be
complete with another person

1832
00:58:18,462 --> 00:58:20,196
Is evil, right?

1833
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:21,631
Can I talk?
You know...

1834
00:58:21,699 --> 00:58:22,966
I guess I've been
heartbroken

1835
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:24,767
Too many times,
and then I recovered.

1836
00:58:24,802 --> 00:58:26,402
So now, you know,
from the starts,

1837
00:58:26,437 --> 00:58:28,304
I make no effort,
because I know

1838
00:58:28,372 --> 00:58:30,473
It's not gonna work out.
You can't. You can't do that.

1839
00:58:30,474 --> 00:58:32,475
You can't live your life
trying to avoid pain

1840
00:58:32,476 --> 00:58:34,310
At the expense--
okay, you know what?

1841
00:58:34,378 --> 00:58:36,045
Those are words.
I've gotta get away from you.

1842
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,447
Stop the car.
I wanna get out.

1843
00:58:37,481 --> 00:58:38,815
No, don't--
no, it's--

1844
00:58:38,816 --> 00:58:40,083
Don't get out.
You know what?

1845
00:58:40,117 --> 00:58:41,217
Keep talking.
It's being around you.

1846
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:42,051
No, don't touch me.
Okay.

1847
00:58:42,086 --> 00:58:43,252
I wanna get a cab.

1848
00:58:43,287 --> 00:58:45,622
[speaks french]
monsieur, monsieur...

1849
00:58:45,656 --> 00:58:47,123
No, no, no. Just--
don't-- keep going.

1850
00:58:47,157 --> 00:58:48,458
Keep--
hey, no, listen.

1851
00:58:48,492 --> 00:58:49,559
I'm just so happy--
[sighs]

1852
00:58:49,593 --> 00:58:50,660
Thank you,
just keep going.

1853
00:58:52,129 --> 00:58:53,129
All right.

1854
00:58:53,163 --> 00:58:54,664
[sighs]

1855
00:58:54,732 --> 00:58:59,068
Look, I am just so happy,
all right, to be with you.

1856
00:58:59,103 --> 00:59:01,604
I am. I'm so glad
you didn't forget about me.

1857
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:03,606
Okay?
No, I didn't,

1858
00:59:03,641 --> 00:59:05,575
And it pisses me off,
okay?

1859
00:59:05,609 --> 00:59:09,512
You come here to paris,
all romantic and married, okay?

1860
00:59:09,513 --> 00:59:10,847
Screw you.

1861
00:59:10,848 --> 00:59:13,149
Don't get me wrong,
I'm not trying

1862
00:59:13,183 --> 00:59:14,517
To get you or anything.

1863
00:59:14,585 --> 00:59:16,686
I mean, all I need
is a married man...

1864
00:59:16,754 --> 00:59:19,022
And there's been so much
water under the bridge,

1865
00:59:19,023 --> 00:59:20,623
It's not even about you anymore.

1866
00:59:20,658 --> 00:59:22,025
It's about that time,
that moment in time,

1867
00:59:22,092 --> 00:59:23,359
That is forever gone.
I don't know.

1868
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,861
You say all that,

1869
00:59:24,862 --> 00:59:27,263
But you didn't even
remember having sex. So...

1870
00:59:27,298 --> 00:59:29,032
Of course I remembered.

1871
00:59:30,634 --> 00:59:33,036
You did?
Yes.

1872
00:59:33,037 --> 00:59:35,305
Women pretend things
like that. I don't know.

1873
00:59:35,339 --> 00:59:36,539
They do?

1874
00:59:36,607 --> 00:59:38,308
Yeah, what was I
supposed to say?

1875
00:59:38,342 --> 00:59:40,043
That I remember
the wine in the park,

1876
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:42,812
And us looking up
at the stars fading away

1877
00:59:42,813 --> 00:59:44,614
As the sun came up?

1878
00:59:44,648 --> 00:59:46,649
We had sex twice,
you idiot!

1879
00:59:46,684 --> 00:59:48,117
[chuckles]

1880
00:59:48,152 --> 00:59:49,319
[chuckles]

1881
00:59:49,353 --> 00:59:50,653
All right.
You know what?

1882
00:59:50,688 --> 00:59:53,189
I'm just happy to see you.

1883
00:59:53,223 --> 00:59:55,124
Even if you've become

1884
00:59:55,159 --> 00:59:57,727
An angry, manic-depressive
activist, I still like you.

1885
00:59:57,728 --> 01:00:00,897
[giggles]
I still enjoy being around you.

1886
01:00:00,965 --> 01:00:02,632
And I feel the same.

1887
01:00:02,666 --> 01:00:04,667
I'm sorry. I don't know
what happened.

1888
01:00:04,702 --> 01:00:06,970
I just... I had to
let it all out.

1889
01:00:07,004 --> 01:00:08,371
Ah, don't worry about it.

1890
01:00:08,405 --> 01:00:10,139
I'm so miserable
in my love life,

1891
01:00:10,174 --> 01:00:11,908
[exhales]
in my relationship.

1892
01:00:11,976 --> 01:00:14,477
I always act as, like,
you know, I'm detached,

1893
01:00:14,511 --> 01:00:16,212
But I'm dying inside.

1894
01:00:16,246 --> 01:00:17,747
I'm dying because
I'm so numb.

1895
01:00:17,815 --> 01:00:19,148
I don't feel pain
or excitement.

1896
01:00:19,183 --> 01:00:21,651
I'm not even bitter.
I'm just...

1897
01:00:21,685 --> 01:00:24,320
You think you're
the one dying inside?

1898
01:00:24,355 --> 01:00:28,024
My life is 24/7 bad.

1899
01:00:28,058 --> 01:00:29,025
[giggles]

1900
01:00:29,059 --> 01:00:30,360
I'm sorry.
No, no.

1901
01:00:30,394 --> 01:00:31,861
I mean,
the only happiness I get

1902
01:00:31,895 --> 01:00:33,429
Is when I'm out
with my son.

1903
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:35,098
I've been
to marriage counseling.

1904
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:36,366
I've done things

1905
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,900
I never thought
I would have to do.

1906
01:00:37,935 --> 01:00:40,270
I've lit candles,
bought self-help books,

1907
01:00:40,271 --> 01:00:41,337
Lingerie...

1908
01:00:41,372 --> 01:00:42,605
Did the candles help?

1909
01:00:42,606 --> 01:00:44,073
Hell, no, all right?

1910
01:00:44,108 --> 01:00:46,242
I don't love her the way
she needs to be loved,

1911
01:00:46,277 --> 01:00:48,044
And I don't even
see a future for us.

1912
01:00:48,078 --> 01:00:51,047
But then I look
at my little boy...

1913
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:52,949
Sitting at the table
across from me,

1914
01:00:53,017 --> 01:00:55,418
And I think I would suffer
any torture to be with him

1915
01:00:55,452 --> 01:00:57,253
For all the minutes
of his life, you know?

1916
01:00:57,288 --> 01:00:59,188
Don't want to
miss out on one.

1917
01:00:59,223 --> 01:01:01,090
But then, th-there's no joy

1918
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:03,393
Or laughter in my home,
you know?

1919
01:01:03,427 --> 01:01:05,361
And I don't want him
growing up in that.

1920
01:01:05,396 --> 01:01:07,430
Ah, no laughter.
That's terrible.

1921
01:01:07,464 --> 01:01:09,299
My parents have been
together for 35 years,

1922
01:01:09,366 --> 01:01:10,967
And even when
they have a bad fight,

1923
01:01:11,035 --> 01:01:12,869
They end up
laughing like crazy.

1924
01:01:12,903 --> 01:01:14,704
Yeah, I just-- I don't want
to be one of those people

1925
01:01:14,738 --> 01:01:16,205
Who are getting
divorced at 52,

1926
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,441
And falling down
into tears,

1927
01:01:18,475 --> 01:01:20,643
Admitting that they never
really loved their spouse,

1928
01:01:20,711 --> 01:01:23,146
And they feel their life
has been...

1929
01:01:23,147 --> 01:01:25,815
Sucked up into
a vacuum cleaner.

1930
01:01:25,816 --> 01:01:27,650
You know, I want a great life.

1931
01:01:27,718 --> 01:01:29,585
I want her to have a great life.

1932
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:31,955
She deserves that,
all right.

1933
01:01:31,989 --> 01:01:34,324
But we're just living
in the pretense of a marriage,

1934
01:01:34,391 --> 01:01:35,458
Responsibility, you know?

1935
01:01:35,492 --> 01:01:36,926
All these, just...

1936
01:01:36,961 --> 01:01:39,595
Ideas of how people
are supposed to live...

1937
01:01:41,298 --> 01:01:42,565
But then I...

1938
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,834
I have these dreams.

1939
01:01:46,503 --> 01:01:48,104
What dreams?

1940
01:01:48,138 --> 01:01:52,342
I have these dreams,
you know, that, um...

1941
01:01:52,343 --> 01:01:54,177
I'm standing on a platform...

1942
01:01:55,446 --> 01:01:56,813
And, uh...
What?

1943
01:01:56,847 --> 01:01:58,748
You keep going by
on a train.

1944
01:01:58,782 --> 01:02:00,450
And...

1945
01:02:00,484 --> 01:02:01,951
You go by,
and you go by,

1946
01:02:01,986 --> 01:02:03,586
And you go by,
you go by.

1947
01:02:03,621 --> 01:02:05,521
And I wake up with
the fucking sweats, you know.

1948
01:02:05,589 --> 01:02:07,790
And then I have
this other dream...

1949
01:02:07,825 --> 01:02:11,861
Ohhhh, where you're pregnant
in bed beside me naked.

1950
01:02:11,862 --> 01:02:13,496
And I want so badly
to touch you,

1951
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:14,964
But you tell me not to.

1952
01:02:14,999 --> 01:02:16,499
And then
you look away, and--

1953
01:02:16,533 --> 01:02:18,134
And I--

1954
01:02:18,168 --> 01:02:20,503
I touch you anyway...

1955
01:02:20,537 --> 01:02:22,805
Right on your ankle,
and your skin is so soft

1956
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,141
That I wake up in sobs,
all right,

1957
01:02:25,175 --> 01:02:26,843
[sighs]
and my wife is sitting there

1958
01:02:26,877 --> 01:02:28,211
Looking at me,

1959
01:02:28,279 --> 01:02:30,046
And I feel like
I'm a million miles from her.

1960
01:02:30,114 --> 01:02:31,948
And I know that
there's something wrong,

1961
01:02:31,982 --> 01:02:33,883
You know, that I--
[groans]

1962
01:02:33,884 --> 01:02:35,885
God, that I can't keep living
like this, that there's gotta be

1963
01:02:35,953 --> 01:02:38,454
Something more to love
than commitment.

1964
01:02:38,489 --> 01:02:41,457
But then I think
that I might've given up

1965
01:02:41,492 --> 01:02:43,726
On the whole idea
of romantic love

1966
01:02:43,727 --> 01:02:47,730
That I-- I might have
put it to bed that...

1967
01:02:47,731 --> 01:02:50,133
That day when
you weren't there.

1968
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:53,903
You know, I think
I might've done that.

1969
01:02:53,971 --> 01:02:56,239
Why are you telling me
all this?

1970
01:02:56,307 --> 01:02:58,308
I'm sorry.

1971
01:02:58,342 --> 01:02:59,509
I don't know.

1972
01:02:59,543 --> 01:03:01,244
I-- I shouldn't have.

1973
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:04,747
I shouldn't have.

1974
01:03:04,748 --> 01:03:06,049
You know, it's so weird.

1975
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:07,083
People think

1976
01:03:07,084 --> 01:03:08,418
They are
the only ones

1977
01:03:08,419 --> 01:03:10,420
Going through
tough times.

1978
01:03:10,487 --> 01:03:12,055
I mean, when I read
the article,

1979
01:03:12,089 --> 01:03:14,090
I thought
your life was perfect.

1980
01:03:14,158 --> 01:03:15,258
[both chuckle]

1981
01:03:15,326 --> 01:03:18,628
A wife, a kid,
published author.

1982
01:03:18,662 --> 01:03:20,063
[laughs]

1983
01:03:20,097 --> 01:03:22,432
But your personal life
is more of a mess than mine.

1984
01:03:22,433 --> 01:03:25,535
Mmmm...
I'm sorry.

1985
01:03:25,569 --> 01:03:27,870
Well, I'm glad it's good
for something.

1986
01:03:27,905 --> 01:03:28,938
[speaks french]

1987
01:03:31,542 --> 01:03:32,942
This is--
this is where you live?

1988
01:03:32,977 --> 01:03:35,745
Yeah.

1989
01:03:35,779 --> 01:03:37,313
So are you just relieved

1990
01:03:37,348 --> 01:03:40,116
That I'm in even more
deep shit than you are?

1991
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:42,418
Yes. You've made me
feel better.

1992
01:03:42,453 --> 01:03:44,320
Oh, good. I'm glad.
[laughs]

1993
01:03:44,355 --> 01:03:45,855
No, I really
wish you the best.

1994
01:03:45,889 --> 01:03:47,156
[sighs]

1995
01:03:47,191 --> 01:03:49,125
It's not because
I'm incapable of having

1996
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:50,893
A good relationship
or a family

1997
01:03:50,928 --> 01:03:53,363
That I wish everyone
to be doomed like me.

1998
01:03:53,397 --> 01:03:55,865
I'm sure you make--
be a great mom someday.

1999
01:03:55,899 --> 01:03:57,233
Really, you think so?

2000
01:03:57,268 --> 01:03:58,334
Oh, yeah,
a few anti-depressants,

2001
01:03:58,369 --> 01:03:59,535
You know,
you'll do great.

2002
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:01,170
[laughs] oh, no.
No.

2003
01:04:01,205 --> 01:04:02,171
Okay, say stop.

2004
01:04:02,206 --> 01:04:03,306
Oh, stop.

2005
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:04,674
Oh!
Hey!

2006
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:05,675
Okay.

2007
01:04:05,709 --> 01:04:07,377
You ready? Okay.
Yes.

2008
01:04:15,452 --> 01:04:17,654
[sighs]

2009
01:04:17,688 --> 01:04:19,822
So...I want to
try something.

2010
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:20,890
What?

2011
01:04:24,161 --> 01:04:25,862
I want to see
if you stay together,

2012
01:04:25,896 --> 01:04:27,397
Or if you dissolve
into molecules.

2013
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,367
How am I doing?

2014
01:04:31,402 --> 01:04:33,836
Still here.

2015
01:04:33,871 --> 01:04:35,939
Good.
I like being here.

2016
01:04:39,843 --> 01:04:41,577
Is this your apartment?

2017
01:04:41,612 --> 01:04:43,379
Oh, no,
I live down there.

2018
01:04:43,414 --> 01:04:44,914
Down there?
Yeah.

2019
01:04:44,949 --> 01:04:46,516
Uh, hey, monsieur.

2020
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:48,518
I'm gonna walk her to her door.
Okay.

2021
01:04:48,552 --> 01:04:50,453
[speaks french]

2022
01:04:57,294 --> 01:05:00,763
This is incredible.
This is where you live?

2023
01:05:00,798 --> 01:05:01,764
Yeah.

2024
01:05:01,799 --> 01:05:02,966
How long
have you been here?

2025
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,534
Four years.

2026
01:05:04,602 --> 01:05:05,935
Wow.

2027
01:05:06,503 --> 01:05:07,470
So tell me...

2028
01:05:07,504 --> 01:05:08,705
What?

2029
01:05:08,739 --> 01:05:10,173
Is it all true
about your dreams,

2030
01:05:10,207 --> 01:05:11,507
Or did you
just say that

2031
01:05:11,542 --> 01:05:13,443
To hopefully
get in my pants?

2032
01:05:13,477 --> 01:05:15,445
Oh, I just said that
to get in your pants.

2033
01:05:15,479 --> 01:05:17,146
I use that all the time.
Oh, okay.

2034
01:05:17,181 --> 01:05:20,283
Does it work?
Ah, you know, sometimes.

2035
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:24,887
Here's my kitty.
Oh, so cute!

2036
01:05:24,922 --> 01:05:26,055
Look at him.

2037
01:05:26,056 --> 01:05:27,557
You know what I love
about this cat

2038
01:05:27,558 --> 01:05:28,858
Is that every morning

2039
01:05:28,892 --> 01:05:30,226
I bring him down
to the courtyard,

2040
01:05:30,227 --> 01:05:32,095
And every single morning

2041
01:05:32,129 --> 01:05:35,198
He looks at everything
like it was the first time:

2042
01:05:35,232 --> 01:05:37,400
Every corner,
every tree,

2043
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:39,469
Every plant.

2044
01:05:39,503 --> 01:05:42,071
Smells everything
with his little cute nose.

2045
01:05:42,106 --> 01:05:43,940
[chuckles]
oh, I love my kitty.

2046
01:05:43,974 --> 01:05:45,074
I love my kitty.

2047
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:47,577
Shoo, shoo.

2048
01:05:47,611 --> 01:05:49,412
What's his name?
Che.

2049
01:05:50,047 --> 01:05:52,081
Che?
Hmmm.

2050
01:05:52,116 --> 01:05:53,616
Uh-huh.

2051
01:05:53,651 --> 01:05:54,651
What?

2052
01:05:54,685 --> 01:05:55,652
Commie.

[both laugh]

2054
01:05:57,221 --> 01:06:00,723
No, "che" in argentina
means "hey."

2055
01:06:00,758 --> 01:06:03,293
Okay.
Yes.

2056
01:06:03,327 --> 01:06:04,661
Oh, baby.

2057
01:06:04,695 --> 01:06:06,863
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
