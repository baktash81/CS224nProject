I thought that we prevent
people from getting sunburned

stop them from drowning.

1053
00:49:15,457 --> 00:49:17,392
School of manta ray in the cove?

1054
00:49:17,394 --> 00:49:18,825
You call Animal Control?

1055
00:49:18,827 --> 00:49:20,495
Before Animal Control shows up,

1056
00:49:20,497 --> 00:49:22,729
the school of manta ray
fly up out of the water,

running a con on the beach, right?

a sand grifter is, Stephanie.

1061

But I would probably call the cops.

1062
00:49:33,577 --> 00:49:36,145
Sand grifters are, uh, beach thieves.

1063
00:49:36,245 --> 00:49:38,379
Okay, so while you're working on your tan,

1064
00:49:38,381 --> 00:49:40,582
they're stealing things
from families on the beach.

1065
00:49:40,584 --> 00:49:41,950
I'll give you one better.

1066
00:49:41,952 --> 00:49:44,551
How about diamond smugglers who
are putting the rocks in surfboards

1067
00:49:44,553 --> 00:49:45,520
and bringing them ashore?

1068
00:49:45,522 --> 00:49:46,955
Everything that you guys are talking about

1069
00:49:46,957 --> 00:49:51,859
sounds like a really, like,
entertaining, but far-fetched TV show.

1070
00:49:51,861 --> 00:49:54,729
But if that was the case, I
would definitely call the cops.

1071
00:49:54,731 --> 00:49:57,232
We could call the cops,
and then do nothing,

1072
00:49:57,234 --> 00:49:58,933
like most people would. But that's not us,

1073
00:49:58,935 --> 00:50:00,368
it's not how we operate.

1074
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:01,868
We watch when other
people don't want to watch.

1075
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:04,504
We protect when other
people don't want to protect.

1076
00:50:04,506 --> 00:50:07,578
If we do the bare minimum,
sometimes people die.

1077
00:50:08,778 --> 00:50:11,379

that just washed ashore.

it fucking kills people.

1079
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:15,950
And now we got a dead body in our bay.

1080
00:50:15,952 --> 00:50:18,653

had the same drugs on them

Absolutely, 100% and here's why.

1619
01:18:11,025 --> 01:18:14,027
The Councilman's boating
accident was no accident at all.

1620
01:18:14,029 --> 01:18:15,460
He had no smoke in his lungs,

1621
01:18:15,462 --> 01:18:16,962
his neck was broken in multiple places.

1622
01:18:16,964 --> 01:18:20,198
Which means he was probably dead
before that boat even caught on fire.

1623
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,905
And our investigation has found
that all of this shady shit

1624
01:18:23,238 --> 01:18:24,806
leads right back to the Huntley.

1625

You're lifeguards.

When you do it,

1628
01:18:30,645 --> 01:18:33,412
it's just a bunch of guys
investigating another bunch of guys.

1631
01:18:38,352 --> 01:18:40,353
Yeah, absolutely. We
read the coroner's report.

1632
01:18:40,355 --> 01:18:42,956
It's all in there before
those other guys switched it.

1633
01:18:42,958 --> 01:18:45,457
Yeah, and I recorded the
whole thing on my cell phone.

you had was destroyed.

The Huntley is a front

But I figured out it's
not about drugs for Leeds,

1958

the entire bay private.

- Yes, it will.

1961
01:34:05,111 --> 01:34:07,545

- Yeah.

1965
01:34:12,151 --> 01:34:15,019
Well, most of them sold out and
signed away their properties.

1966
01:34:15,021 --> 01:34:16,921
Leeds blackmailed the ones who didn't

1967
01:34:16,923 --> 01:34:19,124
and used Dave to help
hack into their accounts.

1968

- Chen.

1974

his property goes back to the city.

1975
01:34:33,574 --> 01:34:35,072

1976
01:34:35,074 --> 01:34:37,309
