1
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,814
<i>Why did you leave me?</i>

2
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:36,535
<i>Why?</i>

3
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:41,539
<i>I don't deserve this!</i>

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,071
<i>Why? Why?</i>

5
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,006
<i>No, darling! No!</i>

6
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:54,841
Have you noticed nobody
speaks ill of dead people?

7
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:57,342
Honey, you're so weird.

8
00:00:57,467 --> 00:00:58,912
And a sissy.

9
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:01,334
Why...

10
00:01:01,467 --> 00:01:04,175
Be quiet! I can't hear anything!

11
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:07,537
<i>Ever since I can remember,</i>

12
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:10,473
<i>I have had more questions than answers.</i>

13
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,039
<i>Sleep, my bah!</i>

14
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:20,374
<i>Sleep, my love</i>

15
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:23,306
<i>Or the Boogeyman will eat you</i>

16
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:26,141
<i>Really? Why would they think that singing</i>

17
00:01:26,267 --> 00:01:29,146
<i>about a monster who eats children
will get me to sleep?</i>

18
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:35,073
THE BIBLE

19
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:49,940
<i>Why do they think little children
don't need privacy?</i>

20
00:01:56,467 --> 00:01:57,878
Grandma,

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,276
why is great-grandma mute?

22
00:02:01,967 --> 00:02:04,413
She's not mute.
One day, she just stopped talking.

23
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:08,071
At first, I thought,
"Dear Lord, she's going nuts.

24
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,807
"Or worse, she might be like Licha,
that senile lady who used to get naked..."

25
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,508
<i>I think more people should give up talking.</i>

26
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,780
The police had to go and get her.

27
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:21,837
It was such a fuss to bring her back.

28
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,873
Mom, is it true that the world is warming up?

29
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:28,841
- Aren't you afraid?
- Afraid of heat? Of course not!

30
00:02:28,967 --> 00:02:31,880
But the Poles might melt
because of global warming...

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,241
Sweetie, don't you worry about those things!

32
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:35,937
We'll fix the air-conditioner.

33
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,303
Dad, how come Pluto is no longer a planet?

34
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:46,034
Yikes!

35
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,574
Of course it is!

36
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:53,810
Jesus, boy! Don't believe
all the things you see on TV.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,413
Imagine if that reincarnation thing were true.

38
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,008
What would you want to be in your next life?

39
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:19,904
Damn, kiddo, you're cuckoo!

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,913
He should be outside,
playing with other kids.

41
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:28,070
As soon as he starts school.

42
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,807
Mark my words:
they're going to bully him.

43
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:37,479
I would have.

44
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,108
<i>But why?</i>

45
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,543
<i>My dad was never more right.</i>

46
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:45,382
Jeremías

47
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,040
Hurry up!
You're going to be late again!

48
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:51,504
I don't want to go to school anymore!

49
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,813
- You have to!
- Why?

50
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:57,073
-'Cause you need to learn things!
- I don't learn anything.

51
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,440
'Cause you're stupid!

52
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:01,247
Why aren't you wearing any underwear?

53
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:03,244
I'm not that stupid!

54
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:08,013
I want to be a veterinarian.

55
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:09,407
Very good.

56
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,401
Yes?

57
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,180
Are we going to have class?

58
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:20,411
Wait for your turn to speak, okay?

59
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,271
Sugei. What do you want to be?

60
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,074
A singer, like the people on The Voice.

61
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,380
So, what do you come to school for?

62
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,501
Jeremías!

63
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,439
It's bad manners to interrupt
your schoolmates.

64
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:34,847
What? We're all here to learn, aren't we?

65
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:37,175
If she wants to be a singer,

66
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,076
shouldn't she stay home and sing?

67
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:43,474
So, what do you want to be
when you grow up?

68
00:05:45,267 --> 00:05:48,077
<i>Usually I was the one asking questions.</i>

69
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,075
That will be your homework.

70
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,004
- You were <i>my</i> friend!
- He never loved you!

71
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:54,942
<i>Shut up, bitch!</i>

72
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,801
Move!

73
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,480
You make a better door than a window!

74
00:06:04,867 --> 00:06:08,508
<i>All I knew for certain was
[didn't want to be like them.</i>

75
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:21,913
I DON'T WANT TO BE
LIKE MY FAMILY

76
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:33,069
What are we celebrating?

77
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,010
Can't I cook my son's favorite breakfast?

78
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,905
Do you think we are good parents?

79
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,573
I guess so.

80
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:02,337
Our son is a weirdo,
but we love him anyway.

81
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:07,313
I was thinking

82
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:09,504
that I could get

83
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:14,077
a nice job, but I'd have
to finish high school first.

84
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,003
What does that have to do with anything?

85
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:21,238
Why don't you work as a maid?

86
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,938
My mom could ask her boss

87
00:07:24,067 --> 00:07:26,843
to get you a job with one of her rich friends.

88
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:29,846
I'm telling you that
I want to do important things!

89
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:32,106
I already clean here!

90
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:35,407
I need my diploma,
so Jeremías can be proud of me.

91
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:37,103
We're broke!

92
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:40,146
And you want me to spend money
on books and exams? No way!

93
00:07:40,267 --> 00:07:42,372
- It's worthless!
- It's not!

94
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,447
Don't be stubborn, woman!
Pass the syrup!

95
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,274
Don't feel bad, Mom.

96
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:59,178
48% of the population
don't finish high school.

97
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:04,103
Moby Dick
From the monstrous images of whales

98
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,440
Why did the chicken cross the road?

99
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:07,968
Why?

100
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,273
To show everyone he wasn't a chicken!

101
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:13,040
- What fish only swims at night?
- What?

102
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:14,475
A starfish!

103
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:18,379
- Where do polar bears vote?
- Where?

104
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:22,176
The North Poll.

105
00:08:25,867 --> 00:08:27,312
What a dummy!

106
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:15,413
Don't, Chamuco!
I don't want to!

107
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:19,208
I don't care, dude!
You have to sell it!

108
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:21,202
What's your problem?

109
00:09:21,433 --> 00:09:24,107
Fire!

110
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:29,341
<i>I'd read once that in case of danger,</i>

111
00:09:29,467 --> 00:09:33,040
<i>it is more effective to yell "fire" than "help."</i>

112
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:35,147
Get him! Go, Rancio!

113
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:37,173
Get the bikes!

114
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:40,004
Fire!

115
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,743
Watch out, kid.

116
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:11,874
Nobody told me the circus was in town.

117
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,741
Look at those monkeys!

118
00:10:15,433 --> 00:10:17,470
You can't catch them any uglier.

119
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,671
What? What?

120
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:25,003
What's up?

121
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:29,837
What?

122
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:36,573
Really?

123
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:41,374
Forget about them!

124
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:45,878
Back to your cages!

125
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:02,944
Look! How about that?

126
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,672
What's up?

127
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,643
Nobody wants to be goalie.
Do you want to play?

128
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,573
You again?

129
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,644
Come here, kiddo. Come.

130
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,707
Sit down and pay attention.

131
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,746
Watch howl kick this tio's ass.

132
00:11:54,867 --> 00:11:58,974
This uncle's name is Felipe.

133
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:02,003
<i>Ge-Yvpe.</i>

134
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,471
With a

135
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,070
- Why do you call him "tio"?
- That's how you say it where I come from.

136
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:08,902
Mr...

137
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:11,842
Geez!

138
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:14,671
I'm Enrique.

139
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,837
My name is Jeremías Gómez Sanchez.

140
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:18,469
Nice to meet you.

141
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,840
My pleasure.

142
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:21,412
Jeremías?

143
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,502
"The Uplifted."

144
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:25,840
- What?
- Like Jeremiah.

145
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:29,505
Jeremías could mean "The Uplifted."

146
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,305
Chocolate is mine.

147
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:41,310
Hey! What's up?

148
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,304
Did you fall out of bed?

149
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,777
It seems he wants
to go to school, right, honey?

150
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,843
I have two new friends.

151
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:54,344
Really?

152
00:12:54,467 --> 00:12:57,778
Enrique and Felipe.
But we call him "Gelipe."

153
00:12:57,967 --> 00:12:59,412
Are they in your class?

154
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,410
No. They're a little bit older than me.

155
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,444
Attaboy!

156
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:22,910
Are you okay?

157
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,607
A fact of life:

158
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,846
in the end, everyone leaves.

159
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:33,574
Our wives, our friends,

160
00:13:33,933 --> 00:13:35,879
<i>EVE OUT chess mates.</i>

161
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,606
But the truth is,
you never get used to it.

162
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,773
"The life of the dead is placed
on the memories of the living."

163
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:51,374
Do you know who said that?

164
00:13:51,933 --> 00:13:52,934
Cicero.

165
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,074
You're a smart child.

166
00:13:59,867 --> 00:14:02,746
You have a good memory.

167
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,347
I can play chess with you, if you want.

168
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,343
Maybe.

169
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:26,745
Thank you for coming. She doesn't
even want to go out anymore.

170
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,938
Is it because great-grandma is going to die?

171
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,546
Before I give you Communion,

172
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,303
I would like to tell you about
the Sunday sermon.

173
00:14:35,433 --> 00:14:37,777
What? Everybody is going to die.

174
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,005
Only some will die sooner.

175
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,708
When the priest said

176
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:48,404
that God created mankind in His own image...

177
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:51,571
On the contrary, in its pride,
mankind created God

178
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,043
in its own image.

179
00:14:54,967 --> 00:14:56,810
- Sacrilegious!
- Shut up, kiddo!

180
00:14:56,933 --> 00:14:58,503
Don't talk nonsense!

181
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,076
I think they lacked imagination.

182
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,314
It would be better if they said
that God is an alien, wouldn't it?

183
00:15:05,633 --> 00:15:07,374
An alien?
Are you out of your mind?

184
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:09,770
Tell that to the Scientologists!

185
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:11,912
Don't listen to him.
He's just a child.

186
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:14,945
Children like you will burn in Hell.

187
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,836
Damned kid!

188
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,643
How embarrassing!

189
00:15:26,033 --> 00:15:27,637
Really, he said that?

190
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:30,304
I didn't say that.
It was Nietzsche.

191
00:15:30,767 --> 00:15:32,371
- Who?
- Nietzsche.

192
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,570
Bless you!

193
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,374
How do you want me to punish him?

194
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,707
Do I force him to have fun?

195
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,313
Should I tickle him to death?

196
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:47,410
In front of those women!
What are they going to think of me?

197
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:50,714
I would've loved to see
those old maids' faces!

198
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:53,476
Do you think it's funny?

199
00:15:54,867 --> 00:15:56,437
You're grounded!

200
00:15:56,567 --> 00:15:57,807
Go to your room.

201
00:16:01,033 --> 00:16:03,035
You can't do anything you like!

202
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:05,034
Done!

203
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,440
Go play outside! And don't
come back until it gets dark!

204
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,812
That's your punishment! Come on!

205
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,038
Check.

206
00:17:21,033 --> 00:17:22,410
Check.

207
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:26,547
Where did you learn that?

208
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:46,375
Check.

209
00:17:57,667 --> 00:17:58,839
Do you see him?

210
00:17:59,467 --> 00:18:00,468
Check.

211
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:03,468
Check.

212
00:18:05,767 --> 00:18:07,303
Checkmate.

213
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:11,344
I won!

214
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:14,339
I wish Enrique were still alive

215
00:18:14,467 --> 00:18:16,538
so that you could beat him!

216
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:23,575
Jeremías, I was thinking I would like
to meet your parents.

217
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,413
My parents don't know
that I've been coming here.

218
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:30,672
They don't even know what chess is.

219
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,973
Honestly, they don't understand anything.

220
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,008
Perhaps I can help them understand you.

221
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:45,412
Good morning.

222
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,313
Excuse me, ma'am,
are you Jeremías's mother?

223
00:18:51,467 --> 00:18:52,639
A genius!

224
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:59,412
I don't think so.
We would have already noticed.

225
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:03,614
Your son has an extraordinary mind.

226
00:19:05,467 --> 00:19:08,346
His teachers would have
said something by now, right?

227
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,006
I'm his mother.
I know him better than anyone.

228
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,006
Wouldn't I have noticed?

229
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:26,339
What are you doing?

230
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,845
I'm studying.

231
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:31,506
But Dad didn't give you permission.

232
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,278
He doesn't have to know.

233
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,505
Are you lying to Dad?

234
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:38,810
It's a white lie.

235
00:19:38,933 --> 00:19:40,469
It won't hurt anyone.

236
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,401
MATH 101 - GED

237
00:19:46,467 --> 00:19:48,242
Don't you think zero is a funny number?

238
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:54,206
If you divide zero by zero,
you can get any number that you want.

239
00:19:55,433 --> 00:19:58,471
Five, 11, 26,

240
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,972
10,000.

241
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,511
It's a paradox.

242
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,039
Really? He brought a friend?

243
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,539
What was he like?

244
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:14,108
Like 80 years old.

245
00:20:14,467 --> 00:20:16,378
They play chess.

246
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,538
Chess?

247
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:23,042
We have to report that asshole!

248
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:28,574
What? Maybe he did something to Jeremías
and that's why he's such a freak!

249
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:31,870
Damn old fart!
I'm going to kick his ass!

250
00:20:32,267 --> 00:20:35,248
It's not like that.
He seems like a nice person.

251
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,971
He talks funny.

252
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,104
How do you think child abusers look? Huh?

253
00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:44,147
Even that Sunday morning
show guy might be a pedophile!

254
00:20:44,267 --> 00:20:46,213
"Put your hand in my pocket, buddy!

255
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,438
"Grab the prize, buddy!"

256
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:50,574
That's how they convince them!

257
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,074
No normal adult likes to spend time
with somebody else's kid.

258
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,040
God, how dirty-minded!

259
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,975
He's the owner of that bookstore
near Hidalgo Square.

260
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,210
He says Jeremías is an extremely gifted child.

261
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:06,912
What?

262
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,244
A genius kid.
Those boys who are really smart.

263
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:11,402
YOUR GIFTED KID

264
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:14,271
No way!

265
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:16,102
Jeremías is not a genius.

266
00:21:18,267 --> 00:21:23,478
He told me there's a test
to measure how smart a person is.

267
00:21:23,933 --> 00:21:25,913
He even offered to pay for it.

268
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,808
Listen...

269
00:21:28,433 --> 00:21:30,970
If anyone's paying for my son's test, it's me!

270
00:21:34,233 --> 00:21:36,042
So we have your permission, then?

271
00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:37,339
Jesus!

272
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,503
We can't waste our money
on nonsense, honey.

273
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:49,841
Okay.

274
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:54,937
Do you really believe that Jeremías
is one of those whiz kids?

275
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:59,376
- Like those kids on the news?
- Why not?

276
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,970
Sometimes you're so...

277
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,480
Naive, to say the least!

278
00:22:10,233 --> 00:22:12,509
I want you to come
straight home from school.

279
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:16,173
I don't want you to hang out
with that old pedophile.

280
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:18,503
Don Felipe came to see me.

281
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,575
- He said you're super smart and...
- Stop, stop!

282
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,902
Don't put ideas in his head!

283
00:22:24,267 --> 00:22:25,974
You are not a genius!

284
00:22:27,033 --> 00:22:28,171
<i>Genius?</i>

285
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,304
- Shouldn't you be at school?
- Do you think I am a genius?

286
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:42,211
What do I have to do to know for sure?

287
00:22:50,133 --> 00:22:52,113
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

288
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,004
I was thinking, if I'm a genius,

289
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:02,443
I must have gotten it from you.

290
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:05,943
Well, my dad was very smart.

291
00:23:13,067 --> 00:23:15,570
I just need you to sign this.

292
00:23:16,033 --> 00:23:17,512
This way, we'll know.

293
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:21,371
If your dad finds out, we'll get in trouble.
You better ask him.

294
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,436
He doesn't need to know.

295
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:25,513
I'm not gonna lie to your dad!

296
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:28,973
It's a white lie.
It won't hurt anyone.

297
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:48,481
Which image from the right goes
in the missing space on the left?

298
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,034
Begin!

299
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:02,510
RECEPTION

300
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:23,568
Hello?

301
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,873
Yes, I'm his father.

302
00:24:34,067 --> 00:24:35,375
It's paid?

303
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,308
Okay. Thanks.

304
00:24:46,233 --> 00:24:47,507
This is weird.

305
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,905
They said Jeremías's test results are ready.

306
00:24:54,467 --> 00:24:56,276
So you helped him?

307
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,174
Darn it, honey!
I can't believe you!

308
00:25:00,433 --> 00:25:02,936
And I can't believe you don't want
your family to improve!

309
00:25:03,067 --> 00:25:04,444
How can you just ignore this?

310
00:25:04,567 --> 00:25:07,844
This is on you!
The kid will only get disappointed.

311
00:25:07,967 --> 00:25:10,573
Why can't you just listen to me
once in awhile?

312
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,147
I'm very glad to inform you,

313
00:25:18,867 --> 00:25:21,814
Jeremías is exceptionally gifted.

314
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:24,171
Congratulations.

315
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,975
Holy cow!

316
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,175
How much is this going to cost us?

317
00:25:40,967 --> 00:25:43,004
So hot dogs?

318
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:47,334
A movie, maybe?

319
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:52,139
Come on, let's go to the movies.

320
00:25:55,233 --> 00:25:56,507
Can I print something?

321
00:25:56,867 --> 00:25:59,245
Twelve for color prints,
three for black-and-white.

322
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,877
Tacos?

323
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,901
Mexican genius kids

324
00:26:05,967 --> 00:26:07,412
Come on, let's go out tonight.

325
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:09,969
Or anytime you want to.

326
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,310
<i>Federico Fomi.
Psychologist who works</i>

327
00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:16,209
<i>with exceptionally gifted children in Mexico?</i>

328
00:26:18,933 --> 00:26:20,003
Who is this?

329
00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:49,278
"Aztecs found an eagle on top of a cactus

330
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,141
"eating a snake

331
00:26:51,267 --> 00:26:54,373
"just like their god Huitzilopochtli
had told them.

332
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:57,411
"So they founded Tenochtitlan there,

333
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,103
"which became Mexico City."

334
00:27:06,034 --> 00:27:09,481
Does anyone know the meaning of "Mexico"?

335
00:27:12,867 --> 00:27:13,937
What about you, Jeremías?

336
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:15,878
Don't you know it?

337
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:19,105
I suppose now that you're a genius
you're bored with my class?

338
00:27:22,134 --> 00:27:25,172
- Should I repeat the question?
- No, thanks.

339
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,941
I heard your question,
but I don't know the answer.

340
00:27:29,567 --> 00:27:31,205
Really?

341
00:27:31,334 --> 00:27:34,042
How can this be?

342
00:27:34,433 --> 00:27:36,913
Because you haven't taught us that.

343
00:27:37,033 --> 00:27:38,944
And it's not in the book.

344
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,470
What I can tell you is,

345
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,145
Tenochtitlan was founded in 1325

346
00:27:45,267 --> 00:27:47,907
and the Aztecs came from Aztlan.

347
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,309
That's on page 88.

348
00:27:51,367 --> 00:27:55,281
If the genius can't answer,
the others are surely doomed.

349
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:58,069
I'm a genius, not a psychic!

350
00:28:00,334 --> 00:28:04,510
<i>I always knew that I was different,
but now I knew why.</i>

351
00:28:05,867 --> 00:28:07,141
<i>I could do anything.</i>

352
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,381
Starting today,
I'm going to be self-taught.

353
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:39,811
Self what?

354
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,511
What do you mean?

355
00:28:41,834 --> 00:28:43,472
I'm going to study on my own.

356
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,370
You're not going to go to school?

357
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:48,143
Shit! I want to be self-taught, too!

358
00:28:49,033 --> 00:28:51,536
Did you know Einstein
was kicked out of school?

359
00:28:51,867 --> 00:28:53,346
I don't care about that "lnstain"!

360
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,201
What?

361
00:28:57,167 --> 00:28:58,510
What, honey?

362
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,809
He can't do whatever he wants!

363
00:29:00,934 --> 00:29:04,848
We, ordinary people, don't think
like Jeremías does. He should know.

364
00:29:04,967 --> 00:29:06,913
You'd better not be lazing around!

365
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:10,944
Forty-five times two,

366
00:29:11,067 --> 00:29:12,273
times 10,

367
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,004
times three, divided by five?

368
00:29:14,134 --> 00:29:15,374
Five hundred and forty.

369
00:29:20,567 --> 00:29:23,138
Twenty-four thousand,
four hundred and ninety-two

370
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,840
times two minus 540?

371
00:29:26,867 --> 00:29:29,370
Forty-eight thousand
four hundred and forty-four.

372
00:29:32,233 --> 00:29:33,371
May I go now?

373
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,845
I always knew my son was kickass!

374
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:38,503
What do you want to be when you grow up?

375
00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:40,972
- You could be a doctor.
- Maybe an astronaut.

376
00:29:41,134 --> 00:29:43,273
Yeah, sure!
As if there were Mexican astronauts.

377
00:29:43,567 --> 00:29:45,046
He could be the first one!

378
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:48,171
Of course there are Mexican astronauts!

379
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,404
- But you know, space...
- A businessman!

380
00:29:51,533 --> 00:29:53,513
Like those guys in the magazines.

381
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:57,213
Maybe a computer developer.
Those guys earn a lot of money!

382
00:29:57,334 --> 00:30:00,543
We can sign him up
for one of those Q8=A TV contests!

383
00:30:00,867 --> 00:30:02,141
We'll win for sure!

384
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,210
It doesn't matter.

385
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:06,904
The important thing is this kid
will make us rich, right, son?

386
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,177
You're going to step on me!

387
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,879
Okay, then.

388
00:30:17,867 --> 00:30:19,175
<i>Good, Rancid!</i>

389
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,110
Look, dude!
The gifted kid!

390
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,245
I'm gifted, too.

391
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,440
Wanna see?

392
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:34,168
Stop there!

393
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,280
So are you going to pay us or not?

394
00:30:36,433 --> 00:30:38,504
We lost a lot of money 'cause of you.

395
00:30:38,834 --> 00:30:40,279
You have to pay us back.

396
00:30:40,367 --> 00:30:41,710
Show me the money.

397
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:44,012
I don't have any money.

398
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,044
We're going to beat the smart out of you!

399
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:48,904
That's physically impossible.

400
00:30:49,033 --> 00:30:50,569
Maybe with a baseball bat.

401
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,246
If you beat me up,
I won't be able to pay you.

402
00:31:02,133 --> 00:31:03,237
He's here!

403
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:11,168
What?

404
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:13,208
Aren't you going to your room?

405
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,137
Everybody pitched in.

406
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:37,369
It's got Internet and everything.

407
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,138
I'm going to pay for it.

408
00:31:39,267 --> 00:31:40,575
What do you think?

409
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,541
A smart kid like you needs
the best technology, right?

410
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,240
Thank you!

411
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:49,441
What about a printer?

412
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:52,207
You want it all.
And you get it all.

413
00:32:00,534 --> 00:32:05,449
Federico Forni: specialized in
exceptionally gifted children in Mexico.

414
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:11,373
<i>Dear doctor...</i>

415
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,801
<i>No, not "dear."</i>

416
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,807
<i>Doctor, my name is Jeremías Gómez.</i>

417
00:32:17,934 --> 00:32:19,504
<i>I live in Hermosillo, Sonora.</i>

418
00:32:19,834 --> 00:32:22,974
<i>I took an IQ test recently.</i>

419
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,876
<i>I scored 160.</i>

420
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,379
<i>My family doesn't understand me,
and I want to show them</i>

421
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,666
<i>that I can be an important man like you.</i>

422
00:32:31,667 --> 00:32:31,906


423
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,079
Why are you so nervous?

424
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,838
Where are you going?

425
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:57,804
To play chess with a friend.

426
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:01,444
Don't be such a nerd!
I'll introduce you to some cool friends!

427
00:33:01,567 --> 00:33:03,911
Come on, let's hang out with my homeboys.

428
00:33:04,033 --> 00:33:06,206
- What?
- You'll like them.

429
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:09,837
And we also have some business to do.

430
00:33:26,567 --> 00:33:28,046
What's up, Tomas?

431
00:33:45,467 --> 00:33:47,811
What's up, super brainiac?

432
00:33:49,134 --> 00:33:50,477
You know each other?

433
00:33:52,033 --> 00:33:54,035
They're the gang that extort me.

434
00:33:54,334 --> 00:33:55,972
What? Come on!

435
00:33:57,134 --> 00:34:00,445
Hey, assholes!
Stop messing around with this kid.

436
00:34:00,567 --> 00:34:03,070
Or I'll mess with you.

437
00:34:06,367 --> 00:34:07,368
Yeah, right.

438
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,802
I'm done.

439
00:34:15,533 --> 00:34:17,103
I'm done!

440
00:34:19,067 --> 00:34:20,341
So fast?

441
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:25,014
Hell yeah! It would take a week
for this moron to finish it!

442
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,802
It's 220 pesos.

443
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,571
You said you'd pay me 20 pesos each.

444
00:34:37,067 --> 00:34:39,308
But it was piece of cake for you, dude!

445
00:34:39,433 --> 00:34:41,538
Anyone with your skills should do it for free.

446
00:34:42,334 --> 00:34:43,972
Yeah, for free.

447
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,809
You owe us money, remember?

448
00:34:46,967 --> 00:34:48,878
We'll subtract it from your balance.

449
00:34:49,067 --> 00:34:50,307
Bring it on, Pildoro!

450
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,972
Get out of here!

451
00:35:18,467 --> 00:35:20,071
Where were you?

452
00:35:20,267 --> 00:35:21,905
Hanging out with some friends.

453
00:35:22,034 --> 00:35:24,480
"Hanging out with some friends"?

454
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,541
Don't lie to me.

455
00:35:26,867 --> 00:35:28,813
I was with my Uncle Raúl.

456
00:35:28,934 --> 00:35:31,540
Raúl? I don't want you
spending time with him!

457
00:35:31,867 --> 00:35:34,040
What's wrong with him?

458
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,210
You're better than that!

459
00:35:38,334 --> 00:35:42,282
You have more important things
to think about, like algebra numbers.

460
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,850
Symbols. The point of algebra is
to replace numbers with symbols.

461
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:51,336
What? You think you're Mr. Know-it-all?

462
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,912
The thing is, you know very little.

463
00:35:54,034 --> 00:35:56,071
Damn spoiled brat!

464
00:35:57,434 --> 00:35:58,538
Why are you laughing?

465
00:35:58,967 --> 00:36:01,379
I'm going to beat you!
Let's see if you laugh then!

466
00:36:01,834 --> 00:36:04,815
I'm laughing because
you're insulting yourself.

467
00:36:04,933 --> 00:36:07,311
You're the one that spoiled me.

468
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:12,448
It's not my fault I have a son like you!
I would give anything for you to be normal!

469
00:36:15,234 --> 00:36:16,440
Go to your room!

470
00:36:16,567 --> 00:36:17,875
Now!

471
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,442
Now, you brat!

472
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:22,904
Yeah, yeah, I spoiled you.

473
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,011
I'm done, Chamuco.

474
00:36:36,234 --> 00:36:38,578
At this rate,
you will pay us very soon.

475
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,311
Very soon.

476
00:36:45,734 --> 00:36:47,236
What? You wanna play?

477
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,001
Go on.

478
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,046
Wow! That's tight, man!

479
00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:10,510
So tight!

480
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:17,814
He plays better than you do!

481
00:37:22,934 --> 00:37:26,404
<i>Doctor, have you ever heard
of a genius named Jim Morrison?</i>

482
00:37:26,534 --> 00:37:31,005
<i>They say his IQ was 149.</i>

483
00:37:31,133 --> 00:37:34,114
<i>And that he used to read
one book after another.</i>

484
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,104
<i>I'm going to be a musician, too.</i>

485
00:37:40,167 --> 00:37:44,843
<i>He definitely had a better look than Einstein.</i>

486
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,272
Did you know Jim Morrison
used drugs and was a genius?

487
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,342
But he didn't use heroin
because of his belonephobia.

488
00:38:12,434 --> 00:38:14,038
Fear of needles.

489
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,908
Easy, you damn walking Wikipedia!

490
00:38:17,334 --> 00:38:18,836
Boring alert!

491
00:38:20,867 --> 00:38:22,540
Geez, I'm just kidding.

492
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,009
I know what I want to be when I grow up!

493
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,238
A famous musician.

494
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,505
Many geniuses were musicians.

495
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:36,043
And on the Internet, I saw many
genius kids who play instruments.

496
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:37,237
And do they get paid?

497
00:38:37,367 --> 00:38:38,744
All musicians are junkies.

498
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:43,105
God didn't give you that gift
for you to become a satanic junkie.

499
00:38:44,367 --> 00:38:47,041
But you don't really have to be smart
to be a musician.

500
00:38:47,134 --> 00:38:48,374
I think you do.

501
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,601
Nope.

502
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,373
All musicians are losers.

503
00:38:53,134 --> 00:38:55,944
Maybe now people would see you and think,

504
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,945
"Look, a kid is playing!"

505
00:38:59,534 --> 00:39:01,878
But that would end when you grow up.

506
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,576
You'll be just like an ordinary dude.
Just playing.

507
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:17,372
- Where are you going?
- To Pildoro's place to play.

508
00:39:18,467 --> 00:39:20,071
I'm going to tell you something.

509
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,380
They got tired of you.
You're just a kid.

510
00:39:22,634 --> 00:39:24,477
My bros told me it's over.

511
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,511
But they're also my bros.

512
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:29,546
Don't get things wrong!
They're my homeboys!

513
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:33,046
And no more homework to do.
It ain't worth it.

514
00:39:35,367 --> 00:39:36,368
Get lost!

515
00:39:46,334 --> 00:39:48,439
Mr. G, I don't know what I'm going to be.

516
00:39:48,867 --> 00:39:51,575
I thought I wanted to be a musician,

517
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,745
but how do you know
what you really want to be?

518
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,571
You will know when you're ready.

519
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,474
I've researched what the most
famous geniuses have done.

520
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,601
And?

521
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,879
All of them knew what they wanted
to be since they were kids.

522
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,571
Picasso started painting at seven.

523
00:40:12,067 --> 00:40:14,673
What would you have done
if you had been a genius?

524
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,609
I would have owned a bookstore.

525
00:40:20,467 --> 00:40:23,812
Maybe the point is very simple.

526
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:28,046
If you had not been a genius,
what would you have wanted to be?

527
00:40:30,734 --> 00:40:33,840
Happiness is the ultimate quest of mankind.

528
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:38,712
Happiness isn't found by
always doing what you want,

529
00:40:38,934 --> 00:40:41,847
but by always loving what you do.

530
00:40:54,867 --> 00:40:56,437
<i>Bobby Fischer is considered</i>

531
00:40:56,567 --> 00:40:59,980
the best chess player of all time.

532
00:41:00,733 --> 00:41:04,010
<i>At 13, he defeated
the World Chess Champion.</i>

533
00:41:04,334 --> 00:41:06,905
<i>That match is known as
"The Game of the Century."</i>

534
00:41:12,467 --> 00:41:16,040
I'm going to be like Bobby Fischer,
the best chess player in the world!

00:41:16,367 --> 00:41:18,313
Checkmate! Checkmate!
Checkmate!

536
00:41:18,433 --> 00:41:22,779
Don't think Hermosillo
is a good place to stand out in chess.

537
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:26,313
Did you know Bobby Fischer died at 64?

538
00:41:26,433 --> 00:41:30,779
Sixty-four! The number of squares
on a chessboard!

539
00:41:31,567 --> 00:41:32,671
Okay.

540
00:41:33,034 --> 00:41:34,877
We'll see what we can do.

541
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,701
Checkmate!

542
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,501
Check!

543
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:44,307
Checkmate!

544
00:41:52,367 --> 00:41:53,368
Checkmate!

545
00:41:54,734 --> 00:41:55,906
Checkmate!

546
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,938
Checkmate.

547
00:42:06,634 --> 00:42:07,874
Checkmate.

548
00:42:08,033 --> 00:42:09,341
Checkmate.

549
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,909
<i>He died alone, sick and exiled.</i>

550
00:42:33,034 --> 00:42:34,775
<i>Why won't he answer?</i>

551
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,436
NO NEW MESSAGES

552
00:42:43,434 --> 00:42:45,880
All right, now!
We're going for the championship!

553
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,946
And on the beach, cool!

554
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,411
What are we going to do
with the money we're gonna win?

555
00:42:52,534 --> 00:42:54,946
"We"? What do you mean, "we"?

556
00:42:55,067 --> 00:42:57,547
Who is driving?

557
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,946
And your mom is covering
for me back at work.

558
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,004
Of course I mean "we"!
It's teamwork!

559
00:43:05,367 --> 00:43:07,870
Or do you prefer to pay for the gas yourself?

560
00:43:15,733 --> 00:43:16,734
Checkmate.

561
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,779
I don't wanna play anymore.

562
00:43:48,034 --> 00:43:51,311
Jeremías, wait!
What's wrong with you?

563
00:43:51,434 --> 00:43:54,745
You can't just leave like that!
This is not a game!

564
00:43:54,867 --> 00:43:57,643
Definition of chess,
"A game for two players,

565
00:43:57,767 --> 00:44:00,043
"each of whom moves 16 pieces..."

566
00:44:00,367 --> 00:44:03,439
No. That smart shit won't work with me.

567
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,704
Let's go.

568
00:44:15,367 --> 00:44:17,813
It's okay, you don't owe me nothing.

569
00:44:19,667 --> 00:44:21,613
That's what dads are for, you know.

570
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,610
Dad, when you were my age,
what did you want to be?

571
00:44:31,734 --> 00:44:32,906
I don't know!

572
00:44:33,767 --> 00:44:36,008
I never had time to think about that.

573
00:44:55,634 --> 00:44:57,409
My dad doesn't understand me.

574
00:44:58,567 --> 00:45:01,070
My son doesn't understand me, either.

575
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,038
You have a son?

576
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,302
If1 Spain?

577
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,835
Right.

578
00:45:07,934 --> 00:45:12,781
Since news reports over there
only talk about the violence over here,

579
00:45:14,634 --> 00:45:16,011
he wants me to go back there.

580
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,438
I think it's time.

581
00:45:26,967 --> 00:45:28,344
Jeremías?

582
00:45:32,467 --> 00:45:33,775
You are the boy genius.

583
00:45:34,934 --> 00:45:36,641
A boy who is a genius.

584
00:45:46,534 --> 00:45:48,946
Have you ever considered being a doctor?

585
00:45:51,034 --> 00:45:54,641
I'm a first-year student,
and it's a great profession.

586
00:45:55,067 --> 00:45:59,038
You can heal sick people.
And save lives.

587
00:45:59,434 --> 00:46:02,506
Can you name a famous genius
who was a doctor?

588
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:14,841
<i>Did you know Marie Curie was
the first to win two Nobel Prizes?</i>

589
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,448
<i>And that her discoveries
are still used in modern medicine?</i>

590
00:46:19,667 --> 00:46:21,044
<i>I suppose you do.</i>

591
00:46:21,567 --> 00:46:25,538
<i>I don't know if you read my emails,
but I'm going to be a doctor.</i>

592
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,747
- What's up with you and Tomas?
- Who is Tomas?

593
00:46:34,067 --> 00:46:38,777
A medical student.
He says I could be a doctor.

594
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,311
That's a good idea!

595
00:46:41,334 --> 00:46:43,007
Doctors make good money.

596
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,837
There's always sick people,
and we'd get free consultations.

597
00:46:47,967 --> 00:46:49,469
Not that kind of doctor.

598
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,308
I want to find cures for diseases,
not heal sick people.

599
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,077
My grandson, a doctor.

600
00:46:54,934 --> 00:46:56,311
I'd be proud!

601
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:05,442
They don't admit children to medical school.

602
00:47:05,767 --> 00:47:07,474
Like Marie Curie.

603
00:47:07,767 --> 00:47:11,010
A century ago,
women couldn't study medicine.

604
00:47:11,334 --> 00:47:12,540
And now, here you are.

605
00:47:12,967 --> 00:47:14,469
First of all,

606
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,639
you have to get a high school diploma
and take an admission test.

607
00:47:18,767 --> 00:47:20,713
That's impossible, unless...

608
00:47:20,834 --> 00:47:22,313
It's possible.

609
00:47:24,567 --> 00:47:26,740
Jeremías's IQ is the same as Einstein's.

610
00:47:26,867 --> 00:47:28,312
What they think his was.

611
00:47:38,634 --> 00:47:41,478
<i>If you are intelligent enough,</i>

612
00:47:41,667 --> 00:47:43,442
<i>everything is possible.</i>

Oh, shit!

618
00:48:52,667 --> 00:48:56,046
Jeremías Gómez is an exceptionally
gifted boy who wants to be a doctor.

619
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:58,973
He's going to take some
of the first-year courses.

620
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,706
We ask that you treat him
like any normal student.

621
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,308
- Is everybody here?
- Yes.

622
00:49:17,434 --> 00:49:19,573
Now, we're going to do a vertical dissection.

623
00:49:23,767 --> 00:49:25,644
Is there a problem, Jeremías?

624
00:49:25,767 --> 00:49:27,075
I can't see!

625
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,311
Let's continue.

626
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,937
What's going on?
Aren't you going to college?

627
00:50:05,867 --> 00:50:09,713
Do you know what I would give
to be like you and do important things?

628
00:50:10,867 --> 00:50:12,540
"Important things"?

629
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,740
Get up.

630
00:50:17,067 --> 00:50:19,604
I don't do anything important.

631
00:50:20,033 --> 00:50:23,014
You're studying to be a doctor,
to heal people.

632
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:24,978
I don't want to do it anymore.

633
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,036
I'm going to tell your dad.

634
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,377
Do you want me to tell you the truth?

635
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:42,406
I'm afraid of blood, and I don't like corpses.

636
00:50:57,067 --> 00:50:58,341
What's up?

637
00:50:58,467 --> 00:51:01,573
You sneaky dog! I know about
your high school grade-cheating.

638
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,045
We're gonna be rich!

639
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:10,874
You do that computer hacking thing,
and I get the clients.

640
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,570
It will be great business.

641
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,378
What? Are you gonna chicken out?

642
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,070
Do you want me to tell your parents?

643
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,346
Your mom will be mad

644
00:51:20,567 --> 00:51:22,342
and my mom even worse!

645
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,943
Put your feet down!

646
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:31,538
What a crybaby!

647
00:51:31,867 --> 00:51:33,904
It's just a little tough love.

648
00:52:12,967 --> 00:52:14,503
What did you do?

649
00:52:14,934 --> 00:52:17,039
Maybe a piece is missing.

650
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:20,981
If you do this gig,
you can get a newer, nicer one.

651
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,541
You don't understand!
It's my best friend!

652
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:24,701
<i>Such a wimp!</i>

653
00:52:28,767 --> 00:52:30,405
How can you be so mean?

654
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,470
What you gonna do?

655
00:52:33,867 --> 00:52:35,676
I'm going to tell my dad.

656
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,077
Let's go, then. I have
a ton of things to tell him, too.

657
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,676
Come on, we're both gonna make some cash.

658
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,074
You'll see, nephew.

659
00:53:00,467 --> 00:53:03,607
I've never had to say goodbye to anyone.

660
00:53:03,867 --> 00:53:05,369
You can write to me.

661
00:53:10,434 --> 00:53:11,504
You know,

662
00:53:11,634 --> 00:53:13,307
many people in Spain,

663
00:53:13,434 --> 00:53:15,380
instead of saying goodbye,

664
00:53:15,634 --> 00:53:17,443
say "see you later."

665
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,640
Are you asleep?

666
00:53:34,767 --> 00:53:35,768
I'm dead.

667
00:53:36,767 --> 00:53:40,340
Don't say those things!
Don't you know it's a sin?

668
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:43,945
- Is dying a sin?
- No. Wanting to die is.

669
00:53:44,334 --> 00:53:46,610
If I should die, would I go to Heaven?

670
00:53:47,467 --> 00:53:49,640
Of course.

671
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,577
If Heaven is as cool as they say,
why wouldn't I want to die?

672
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,338
Nobody is going to die. Shut up.

673
00:53:55,467 --> 00:53:58,937
- We're all going to die!
- Enough! God will punish you!

674
00:53:59,067 --> 00:54:01,673
Why are you so sure that God exists?

675
00:54:03,034 --> 00:54:04,308
Well...

676
00:54:04,767 --> 00:54:05,973
Because...

677
00:54:06,967 --> 00:54:09,914
Because it's something that you can feel.

678
00:54:14,534 --> 00:54:16,741
<i>I've been reading about Alan Turing,</i>

679
00:54:16,867 --> 00:54:18,437
<i>a famous genius</i>

680
00:54:18,567 --> 00:54:21,946
<i>who was a pioneer
in the creation of computers.</i>

681
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,606
<i>He was a brilliant man.</i>

682
00:54:23,734 --> 00:54:27,511
<i>Despite that, people despised him</i>

683
00:54:27,933 --> 00:54:29,879
<i>because he was gay.</i>

684
00:54:32,633 --> 00:54:36,308
<i>He committed suicide,
eating a poisoned apple</i>

685
00:54:36,433 --> 00:54:38,413
<i>like Snow White's.</i>

686
00:54:50,333 --> 00:54:51,539
Did you get it?

687
00:54:51,767 --> 00:54:53,713
I'll give it to you on one condition.

688
00:54:54,834 --> 00:54:57,440
Let me do the experiment with you.

689
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,678
Cyanide is very dangerous.

690
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,973
I know cyanide is lethal.

691
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,041
So I'm going to handle it with care.

692
00:55:06,367 --> 00:55:09,940
I have a theory about chlorates and nitrates

693
00:55:10,067 --> 00:55:14,072
that are used to purify water
that is polluted with lead.

694
00:55:15,767 --> 00:55:17,041
If this works,

695
00:55:17,367 --> 00:55:19,938
you would be part of the research.

696
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,576
What does Valium have to do with this?

697
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:39,307
Are you familiar with Alan Turing's work?

698
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,971
I'm just improving his technique.

699
00:55:50,734 --> 00:55:52,509
Thank you, Tomas.

700
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:43,832
<i>If suicide is a sin,
would I go to Hell?</i>

701

702
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,701
Hello.

703
00:57:01,667 --> 00:57:03,578
Let me introduce myself.

704
00:57:04,834 --> 00:57:06,814
I'm Dr. Federico Forni.

705
00:57:08,934 --> 00:57:10,072
How are you?

706
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,439
Turing's prosecution
for homosexuality and death

707
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,670
Thank you.

708
00:58:00,633 --> 00:58:03,546
Your son's IQ is one
of the highest I've ever seen.

709
00:58:03,667 --> 00:58:07,615
Nevertheless, sometimes these kids
can show some signs of autism.

710
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:08,804
Not Jeremías.

711
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,810
He already received his First Communion.

712
00:58:16,567 --> 00:58:18,774
<i>Ram, are you home'?</i>

713
00:58:21,767 --> 00:58:23,747
<i>I wonder how long it will take.</i>

714
00:58:29,567 --> 00:58:30,773
After the interview,

715
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,972
we'll know if Jeremías
is suitable for this project.

716
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,672
If he's interested.

717
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,001
Of course.

718
00:58:37,334 --> 00:58:38,335
Of course.

719
00:58:39,534 --> 00:58:40,672
Jeremías!

720
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,973
Sweetie, someone is here to see you!

721
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,345
Jeremías ate a poisoned apple!

722
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,235
Jeremías.

723
00:59:12,267 --> 00:59:13,541
Jeremías!

724
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:18,269
Jeremías?

725
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,168
Jeremías!

726
01:00:25,534 --> 01:00:27,309
Jeremías, sweetie!

727
01:00:27,934 --> 01:00:29,038
Wake up!

728
01:00:29,967 --> 01:00:32,004
God, don't let him die!

729
01:00:32,134 --> 01:00:34,375
- Are you here?
- Yes.

730
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,240
For real?

731
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:42,107
Einstein said...

732
01:00:43,067 --> 01:00:48,016
<i>"Man finds God behind every door
that science is able to open."</i>

733
01:00:48,167 --> 01:00:49,976
THE DIVINE COMEDY

734
01:01:13,934 --> 01:01:16,414
<i>In the end, I just took a Valium.</i>

735
01:01:18,167 --> 01:01:21,114
<i>Alter all, I believed a little bit in God.</i>

736
01:01:32,934 --> 01:01:36,381
Genius has always been linked to suicide.

737
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:40,338
It's not easy for a kid
to manage emotional dyssynchrony.

738
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:45,105
Jeremías didn't get that far,
but this is a cry for help.

739
01:01:50,967 --> 01:01:52,275
What I am trying to say is,

740
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,937
I'm a psychologist
who specializes in these kids.

741
01:01:55,067 --> 01:01:56,808
And I want to help him.

742
01:01:57,067 --> 01:01:59,308
Then, is Jeremías going to be okay?

743
01:02:00,067 --> 01:02:01,375
You know, healthy.

744
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:10,970
Do you know who I am?

745
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,101
Of course.

746
01:02:12,234 --> 01:02:14,305
You're Dr. Federico Forni.

747
01:02:15,467 --> 01:02:17,310
I got all your e-mails.

748
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:22,541
I was looking forward to meeting you.

749
01:02:29,267 --> 01:02:33,545
Did you know Einstein's brain
is at Princeton University?

750
01:02:35,934 --> 01:02:38,414
Did you know there are
several theories about

751
01:02:38,534 --> 01:02:41,174
the meaning of the word "Mexico"?

752
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:42,335
I do.

753
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:45,505
"Place at the center of the moon"
is the most accepted.

754
01:02:45,833 --> 01:02:47,176
That's right!

755
01:02:48,967 --> 01:02:51,345
So how's your quest going?

756
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:54,979
Who is going to be
the next genius on your wall?

757
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,775
Can I ask you something?

758
01:03:02,934 --> 01:03:04,038
Yes.

759
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,412
When you were a kid,
what did you want to be?

760
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,472
Ever since I can remember,
I wanted to be a doctor.

761
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:14,403
My father,
who is also exceptionally gifted,

762
01:03:14,534 --> 01:03:16,912
is one of Mexico's best neurologists.

763
01:03:17,234 --> 01:03:20,147
And I always wanted
to follow in his footsteps.

764
01:03:20,267 --> 01:03:23,805
He heals the brain in a physical way,
and I heal it from the inside.

765
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:26,774
My dad works in a convenience store.

766
01:03:32,133 --> 01:03:36,309
I have to tell you, I'm really impressed
that you got your high school diploma.

767
01:03:36,934 --> 01:03:38,277
Congratulations.

768
01:03:43,233 --> 01:03:45,235
Thanks, but don't tell my mom.

769
01:03:46,433 --> 01:03:48,879
I don't care how you did it.

770
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:53,449
It only confirms that your
intellectual capacity is extraordinary.

771
01:03:54,767 --> 01:03:58,237
Jeremías, I'm here to help you use your talent.

772
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,870
- You can do anything you want.
- What if I don't want anything?

773
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,503
Then you wouldn't
have written those e-mails.

774
01:04:07,034 --> 01:04:08,308
Am I wrong?

775
01:04:11,434 --> 01:04:13,277
- Yes.
-ls it gonna be about me?

776
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:16,338
You're gonna write a book about my son?

777
01:04:16,467 --> 01:04:18,003
That's right.

778
01:04:18,334 --> 01:04:20,007
I'm writing my third book.

779
01:04:20,434 --> 01:04:23,381
- A book about Jeremías Gómez.
- Sénchez.

780
01:04:23,967 --> 01:04:26,413
This book is about the research I'm doing

781
01:04:26,533 --> 01:04:29,036
and there are other children involved.

782
01:04:29,167 --> 01:04:31,477
- Children like me?
- Yes.

783
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:35,304
If your parents authorize it,
you'll spend time with them.

784
01:04:35,534 --> 01:04:39,277
And is there some sort
of payment for this investigation?

785
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,175
Of course. Plus a bonus

786
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:44,304
because we're documenting
the process on video

787
01:04:44,433 --> 01:04:46,936
to possibly make a documentary.

788
01:04:47,067 --> 01:04:50,048
- Sorry for being redundant.
- Don't worry.

789
01:04:50,467 --> 01:04:51,969
A documentary?

790
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:53,238
A movie.

791
01:04:53,367 --> 01:04:55,904
And I would like to interview you, too.

792
01:04:56,967 --> 01:04:58,503
Hell, yeah!

793
01:04:58,967 --> 01:05:00,947
We're going to be famous!

794
01:05:01,234 --> 01:05:02,907
Like the guys on reality shows.

795
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:10,243
Jeremías, what do you expect
from this project?

796
01:05:20,067 --> 01:05:24,482
Listen. You have to say
the first thing that comes to your mind.

797
01:05:25,967 --> 01:05:28,038
Don't be afraid of being honest.

798
01:05:35,167 --> 01:05:36,271
Okay.

799
01:05:38,867 --> 01:05:43,543
<i>What excites me the most about
the project is making friends.</i>

800
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:48,504
<i>Other kids like me,
who I can talk to.</i>

801
01:06:10,034 --> 01:06:13,447
We, as parents,
have a feeling, you know?

802
01:06:15,533 --> 01:06:19,242
Do you want a cool shot
of me with the pickup truck?

803
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,138
Cut.

804
01:06:21,267 --> 01:06:22,837
No, that's fine.

805
01:06:22,967 --> 01:06:24,537
- Thanks.
- Are we done?

806
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:28,075
- Well...
- You were really good.

807
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:32,272
- I could be a good actor, right?
- Yes, yes.

808
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,141
- Thank you.
- Okay.

809
01:06:41,767 --> 01:06:44,441
Well, now we'll start
the second part of the project.

810
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:48,806
I would like to take Jeremías
to Mexico City for some lectures.

811
01:06:48,934 --> 01:06:51,210
Obviously, everything will be paid for.

812
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:54,242
- On a plane?
- They can't go on foot.

813
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:56,779
On a plane, right?

814
01:06:57,167 --> 01:06:58,168
Of course.

815
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:02,145
Cool! I've never been on a plane.

816
01:07:02,434 --> 01:07:05,313
- I'm scared.
- Don't be silly, honey!

817
01:07:05,434 --> 01:07:07,971
Let him take this opportunity!

818
01:07:12,434 --> 01:07:15,415
Don't worry.
You don't have to decide now.

819
01:07:15,534 --> 01:07:19,175
Discuss the subject and make your decision.

820
01:07:21,767 --> 01:07:25,180
However, I'm going to need

821
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,174
your signature on this contract.

822
01:07:33,833 --> 01:07:36,507
It's your release.

823
01:07:36,834 --> 01:07:38,108
What for?

824
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:42,304
So you can be in the movie.

825
01:07:53,967 --> 01:07:56,277
Sign! The doctor can't wait all day!

826
01:08:09,334 --> 01:08:11,905
It's not Catholic to send
your children away with strangers.

827
01:08:13,834 --> 01:08:16,781
One day, I'll travel on planes.
You'll see.

828
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:20,909
God knows what will be there.
Mexico City is like Sodom and Gomorrah.

829
01:08:21,034 --> 01:08:23,310
Sodom and Gomorrah are two cities and...

830
01:08:23,434 --> 01:08:25,471
Don't interrupt!

831
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:28,476
I can't allow you to send him there.

832
01:08:28,934 --> 01:08:31,039
Those city slickers are gonna brainwash him.

833
01:08:31,167 --> 01:08:34,273
I'm scared, too. We don't know
anything about that doctor.

834
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:35,902
I don't like him.

835
01:08:36,167 --> 01:08:39,011
Those city slickers are going to corrupt him.

836
01:08:39,134 --> 01:08:41,876
- And he...
- Okay, okay! Enough!

837
01:08:42,533 --> 01:08:44,410
You're gonna scare him.

838
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:48,107
Jeremías is going because he wants to, right?

839
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:52,537
Don't make a fuss!
This is good for all of us.

840
01:09:03,467 --> 01:09:04,775
What?

841
01:09:25,034 --> 01:09:27,105
Hello? Hello?

842
01:09:28,267 --> 01:09:30,873
Yes. No, no, we just arrived.

843
01:09:32,067 --> 01:09:34,445
Yes, everything is going well.

844
01:09:38,034 --> 01:09:40,981
Yep. Tell my assistant
to give you the information.

845
01:09:41,967 --> 01:09:44,447
Take him to his room,
and show him the house.

846
01:09:44,767 --> 01:09:45,871
Hello?

847
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,270
Yes.

848
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:53,180
Yes. I tell you, he is perfect,
just what we need.

849
01:09:54,334 --> 01:09:57,804
Right! That punch we were looking for.

850
01:09:59,434 --> 01:10:01,141
You should see his family.

851
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,074
Jesus!

852
01:10:09,034 --> 01:10:11,537
You're going to sleep here.
Do you like it?

853
01:10:12,101 --> 01:10:13,546
Is this room only for me?

854
01:10:15,767 --> 01:10:17,303
I love it!

855
01:10:17,434 --> 01:10:19,846
<i>It's like being in a soap opera.</i>

856
01:10:19,967 --> 01:10:23,210
<i>I have a huge bed,
and the mattress is so soft.</i>

857
01:10:23,334 --> 01:10:24,836
So he has a lot of money?

858
01:10:24,967 --> 01:10:26,037
Tons of it!

859
01:10:26,167 --> 01:10:30,172
He has three flat screens, a guest room

860
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:32,405
and a big fridge with a screen on it!

861
01:10:32,534 --> 01:10:34,172
Ask him if he misses us.

862
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:36,507
<i>Everything is amazing!</i>

863
01:10:36,834 --> 01:10:38,472
- Let me talk to him.
- Wait!

864
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,144
Are you ready to meet Ricardo and his dad?

865
01:10:41,267 --> 01:10:42,268
Yes!

866
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,380
I have to go. Bye!

867
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,845
Too bad, honey.

868
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,946
I want him to come back.

869
01:10:53,067 --> 01:10:54,375
I don't get you.

870
01:10:54,501 --> 01:10:58,881
First you wanted to prove he was
a genius and now you're jealous.

871
01:11:01,067 --> 01:11:02,137
Come here.

872
01:11:03,834 --> 01:11:07,372
We can take the bus and go there.

873
01:11:08,067 --> 01:11:10,104
And we can stay at the doc's.

874
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,273
He said it's a big house.

875
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,666
Come on, don't be silly.

876
01:11:17,667 --> 01:11:18,066


877
01:11:18,067 --> 01:11:20,445
The ultimate genius is da Vinci.

878
01:11:21,367 --> 01:11:24,541
He was a painter, sculptor, urban planner,

879
01:11:24,867 --> 01:11:27,370
inventor and designer.

880
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:31,343
Besides, his anatomy studies
are still current.

881
01:11:32,434 --> 01:11:35,415
He thought sleeping was a waste of time.

882
01:11:35,534 --> 01:11:38,014
That's the role model
that I want for Ricardito.

883
01:11:38,534 --> 01:11:41,777
Do you think if we don't
stimulate intelligence,

884
01:11:41,901 --> 01:11:43,505
it may deteriorate?

885
01:11:43,834 --> 01:11:45,279
I'm certain that

886
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:50,816
education is key in developing
abilities from a young age.

887
01:11:51,134 --> 01:11:54,411
Ricardito has had special tutors
since he was three years old.

888
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,074
What are you laughing at?

889
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:15,512
Andres wrote something funny.

890
01:12:20,467 --> 01:12:22,174
Where do polar bears vote?

891
01:12:22,867 --> 01:12:26,007
The North Poll.

892
01:12:33,234 --> 01:12:36,545
Kant offers a linguistic explanation.

893
01:12:36,867 --> 01:12:39,507
Sartre considers it a phenomenon.

894
01:12:39,834 --> 01:12:42,906
From Heidegger
to Neoplatonic philosophers,

895
01:12:43,034 --> 01:12:45,014
they looked for a definition of being.

896
01:12:45,134 --> 01:12:48,513
Is not Parmenides' definition
the most accurate

897
01:12:48,834 --> 01:12:52,145
because he defined being
as the opposite of not being?

898
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:54,242
Knowing is almost not being.

899
01:13:58,134 --> 01:14:00,478
By observing the subject,
Jeremías Gómez,

900
01:14:01,001 --> 01:14:03,379
a brilliant kid with a lot of potential,

901
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:06,947
<i>we can see that intelligence is not hereditary</i>

902
01:14:07,067 --> 01:14:10,071
<i>because his parents are far below average.</i>

903
01:14:10,434 --> 01:14:14,314
However, Ricardo Lecanda,
son of an eminent surgeon...

904
01:14:15,134 --> 01:14:18,343
Don't say you miss him,
or any of that nonsense.

905
01:14:18,501 --> 01:14:21,004
Ask him if we can go visit him.

906
01:14:23,134 --> 01:14:25,876
If it were up to you,
you would sell the kid.

907
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:29,870
If that gets me out of here,
I might do it.

908
01:14:30,001 --> 01:14:31,537
Well, the door is right there.

909
01:14:33,934 --> 01:14:35,413
Ungrateful.

910
01:14:38,967 --> 01:14:40,344
A call from home.

911
01:14:42,234 --> 01:14:43,372
Mom?

912
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:45,173
<i>Honey, how are you?</i>

913
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:46,540
I'm fine.

914
01:14:47,467 --> 01:14:51,176
<i>You love it there, don't you?
The doctor sent us a check.</i>

915
01:14:51,301 --> 01:14:53,406
<i>We're so proud of you.</i>

916
01:14:54,234 --> 01:14:55,440
What's new?

917
01:14:55,767 --> 01:14:57,337
<i>Nothing in particular.</i>

918
01:14:57,967 --> 01:15:00,072
What are people like over there?
Really posh?

919
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,077
Tell him to ask the doctor!

920
01:15:02,201 --> 01:15:06,274
The kids are real'! <i>y</i> smart.
They know a Jot of things.

921
01:15:06,834 --> 01:15:08,814
They've read a lot.

922
01:15:08,967 --> 01:15:10,844
And they play instruments!

923
01:15:11,134 --> 01:15:12,135
Cool.

924
01:15:12,267 --> 01:15:16,545
<i>And Ricardito's dad has
all the books you can imagine!</i>

925
01:15:16,867 --> 01:15:19,143
- His library is enormous!
- Ask him if we can visit.

926
01:15:19,267 --> 01:15:20,837
<i>He's a lucky kid!</i>

927
01:15:20,967 --> 01:15:22,776
<i>- What is Dad saying?
- Nothing.</i>

928
01:15:22,901 --> 01:15:23,902
What?

929
01:15:24,867 --> 01:15:28,144
Son, maybe we'll visit you.
We'll stay in your room.

930
01:15:28,267 --> 01:15:29,940
<i>Why do you want to come?</i>

931
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:33,105
<i>You can't. I'm really busy.</i>

932
01:15:33,234 --> 01:15:36,408
You don't want us to come.
You're ashamed of us, right?

933
01:15:36,534 --> 01:15:39,174
We won't take up space.
He won't even notice.

934
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:42,040
<i>Mom, this is my chance.</i>

935
01:15:43,967 --> 01:15:45,503
I have to go.

936
01:15:49,367 --> 01:15:50,505
What did he say?

937
01:15:58,234 --> 01:15:59,975
I understand.

938
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,303
I want you to consider if we can...

939
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:18,239
Do you like chess?

940
01:16:18,367 --> 01:16:21,371
My dad says it's a genius child cliché.

941
01:16:21,534 --> 01:16:24,242
Nevertheless, he forced me
to play when I was a younger.

942
01:16:24,367 --> 01:16:27,439
What does cliche mean?
I've never heard that word.

943
01:16:34,167 --> 01:16:35,874
Do you know what they're talking about?

944
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:38,875
I'll be on the cover of the book.

945
01:16:39,367 --> 01:16:41,278
- Only you?
- Yes.

946
01:16:41,834 --> 01:16:44,974
If you want to be on the cover,
tell your parents to pay for his next book.

947
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:09,111
What's going on?

948
01:17:09,834 --> 01:17:11,472
I don't feel so good.

949
01:17:12,034 --> 01:17:14,514
I feel like throwing up.

950
01:17:16,534 --> 01:17:19,174
It must have been all those hot dogs.

951
01:17:19,934 --> 01:17:22,540
You eat like a dude, honey!

952
01:17:26,234 --> 01:17:29,579
Aren't you afraid that Jeremías
will stay there forever?

953
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:31,077
He won't.

954
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,111
He will, you'll see.

955
01:17:33,767 --> 01:17:38,477
He will meet all those important people
you see in the papers.

956
01:17:39,134 --> 01:17:40,977
Why would he come back

957
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:44,147
to be trapped in this house
the whole day getting bored?

958
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:47,646
Maybe it's you who wants to leave!

959
01:17:47,767 --> 01:17:51,579
If I hadn't gotten pregnant so young,
I would have done a lot of things!

960
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:53,509
Yeah, sure!

961
01:18:01,767 --> 01:18:04,873
Do you know what you want
to be when you grow up?

962
01:18:08,167 --> 01:18:10,078
A doctor, obviously.

963
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:14,979
My dad has prepared me to become
the best surgeon in the country.

964
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:18,941
A businessman! Like my dad.

965
01:18:19,067 --> 01:18:21,707
My dad always steers me towards finance.

966
01:18:21,834 --> 01:18:24,610
And my mom wants me
to study political science.

967
01:18:24,734 --> 01:18:26,236
So I'm doing both.

968
01:18:26,567 --> 01:18:30,174
They say I can be the first
female president of the country.

969
01:18:31,034 --> 01:18:33,844
Yeah, but what do you really want to be?

970
01:18:42,034 --> 01:18:43,672
I'm not sure.

971
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,036
Are you done?

972
01:18:54,534 --> 01:18:55,774
What?

973
01:18:56,067 --> 01:18:58,104
Did you finish school?

974
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:03,844
I think they made a mistake.
I passed tests that I haven't done.

975
01:19:04,934 --> 01:19:09,542
Maybe you're also a genius
and you did it by telepathy.

976
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:13,877
What are you up to?

977
01:19:15,567 --> 01:19:16,671
Nothing.

978
01:19:17,734 --> 01:19:20,681
Those are the perks
of having a whiz kid as a son.

979
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,211
Tell me.

980
01:19:27,534 --> 01:19:28,706
<i>How did you do it?</i>

981
01:19:28,834 --> 01:19:30,609
You have to find a pattern.

982
01:19:30,734 --> 01:19:32,941
<i>Don't tell me how!</i>

983
01:19:33,067 --> 01:19:35,673
<i>I thought God had helped me,
but it was you.</i>

984
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:38,838
You wanted to get your diploma,
didn't you?

985
01:19:39,567 --> 01:19:43,709
<i>Yes. But I didn't need your help.
Do you think I'm stupid?</i>

986
01:19:44,234 --> 01:19:47,875
You had been studying for so long
and you hadn't finished.

987
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,480
<i>What you did is wrong!</i>

988
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:54,677
<i>You know what?
You can stay there!</i>

989
01:19:54,967 --> 01:19:57,504
I hope you'll be happy
with all those intellectuals.

990
01:19:58,134 --> 01:20:00,740
I hope my other child will be normal.

991
01:20:08,167 --> 01:20:10,147
You went too far.

992
01:20:12,167 --> 01:20:13,976
Look on the bright side.

993
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:18,913
You got your high school diploma
and saved a lot of money.

994
01:20:20,134 --> 01:20:22,637
Now you can get a job,
like you wanted.

995
01:20:25,634 --> 01:20:27,477
I'm pregnant.

996
01:20:36,634 --> 01:20:38,113
I always knew it.

997
01:20:39,134 --> 01:20:42,707
<i>We, as parents,
have a feeling, you know?</i>

998
01:20:45,534 --> 01:20:46,808
ls that the documentary?

999
01:20:49,134 --> 01:20:51,136
Are your parents smart?

1000
01:20:51,467 --> 01:20:53,037
My father is a genius.

1001
01:20:55,134 --> 01:20:56,841
Yeah, you told me.

1002
01:20:58,667 --> 01:20:59,873
What about your mom?

1003
01:21:00,934 --> 01:21:02,470
No, my mother is not.

1004
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:05,547
The documentary is about that.

1005
01:21:06,134 --> 01:21:10,742
About how a kid like you
can have parents with a low IQ.

1006
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:15,474
How someone so brilliant can be found
where you least expect it.

1007
01:21:17,467 --> 01:21:20,744
But the other children
know so much more than I do.

1008
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,237
Do you want to know a secret?

1009
01:21:26,867 --> 01:21:29,211
Of all those children,

1010
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:33,109
you have the highest IQ.

1011
01:21:34,367 --> 01:21:35,607
Really?

1012
01:21:35,967 --> 01:21:36,968
By far.

1013
01:21:37,167 --> 01:21:41,240
You are one of the most
intelligent people I know.

1014
01:21:44,034 --> 01:21:46,014
Well, I don't know so many.

1015
01:21:46,134 --> 01:21:51,015
I mean, you must have a high IQ, don't you?

1016
01:21:53,767 --> 01:21:56,247
Well, you may find this funny,

1017
01:21:56,567 --> 01:21:58,740
but I've never taken the test.

1018
01:21:59,934 --> 01:22:02,938
Let's go to sleep.
Tomorrow is a big day.

1019
01:22:03,067 --> 01:22:06,048
My father and the dean will be there.

1020
01:22:06,167 --> 01:22:08,738
They will offer you a full scholarship.

1021
01:22:08,867 --> 01:22:11,040
They'll pay for everything
so that you can live here.

1022
01:22:11,167 --> 01:22:14,580
Here? In Mexico City?

1023
01:22:15,734 --> 01:22:17,645
You will do great things!

1024
01:22:17,767 --> 01:22:19,508
What about my family?

1025
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:22,974
You're not like them.
You will be better off here.

1026
01:22:24,167 --> 01:22:26,875
And you can send them money.

1027
01:22:27,001 --> 01:22:28,241
It's a win-win situation.

1028
01:23:01,834 --> 01:23:02,938
Please.

1029
01:23:03,501 --> 01:23:04,946
Thanks, Andrés.

1030
01:23:05,767 --> 01:23:07,974
Well, as you already know,

1031
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:10,740
the research that I'm doing

1032
01:23:10,867 --> 01:23:12,107
is being filmed.

1033
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:13,877
So it's an honor for me

1034
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,880
to present the first sneak peek
of our documentary.

1035
01:23:26,534 --> 01:23:29,743
GENIUS,
BORN OR MADE?

1036
01:23:31,834 --> 01:23:33,245
PARENTS

1037
01:23:33,567 --> 01:23:38,573
<i>IQ is measured with a test
with tricky questions, right?</i>

1038
01:23:38,901 --> 01:23:41,677
<i>Subject's average in a Gaussian Bell.</i>

1039
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:44,610
<i>"lnstain"?
He invented something...</i>

1040
01:23:44,734 --> 01:23:47,112
<i>The light!
He invented the light, didn't he?</i>

1041
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:51,911
<i>There is this guy...
What's his name? The...</i>

1042
01:23:52,034 --> 01:23:53,513
<i>The shaggy gill--</i>

1043
01:23:53,867 --> 01:23:55,938
<i>The ultimate genius is da Vinci.</i>

1044
01:23:56,867 --> 01:23:58,938
<i>Morrison! Yes, that dude!</i>

1045
01:24:00,867 --> 01:24:02,141
<i>A prodigy?</i>

1046
01:24:02,467 --> 01:24:04,879
<i>It's like something magic.</i>

1047
01:24:05,534 --> 01:24:07,946
<i>I find the human mind fascinating.</i>

1048
01:24:08,634 --> 01:24:13,049
<i>My son's mind is exceptional,
so I am always fascinated.</i>

1049
01:24:14,034 --> 01:24:16,605
COMING SOON

1050
01:24:23,834 --> 01:24:25,745
Was that your plan?

1051
01:24:26,034 --> 01:24:29,072
- What?
- To humiliate my parents like that?

1052
01:24:29,901 --> 01:24:34,782
Research must be impartial,
and that's what I'm doing.

1053
01:24:35,601 --> 01:24:38,980
- I didn't force them to do anything.
- But my dad trusted you!

1054
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:41,876
Come on!
Your dad only wanted the money.

1055
01:24:42,001 --> 01:24:44,208
He didn't even know who I was!

1056
01:24:44,534 --> 01:24:47,481
All he wanted was to get paid in advance.

1057
01:25:00,167 --> 01:25:01,942
Besides, he signed a contract

1058
01:25:02,067 --> 01:25:04,980
authorizing me to use their footage
any way I want to.

1059
01:25:05,101 --> 01:25:08,014
You think you're better than they are!

1060
01:25:11,067 --> 01:25:13,547
Am I the one who thinks
I'm better than they are?

1061
01:25:16,467 --> 01:25:20,506
This is your chance to be someone.
Don't spoil it.

1062
01:25:20,634 --> 01:25:22,944
You know how many kids
would want to be you?

1063
01:25:23,167 --> 01:25:24,840
Do you want to be someone?

1064
01:25:35,534 --> 01:25:36,842
Victor Hugo said,

1065
01:25:36,967 --> 01:25:40,608
"Brilliance is an entity,
just like nature.

1066
01:25:40,734 --> 01:25:43,806
"It wants to be treated
in a clear and simple way."

1067
01:25:43,934 --> 01:25:48,713
There is a reason for everything.

1068
01:25:50,034 --> 01:25:52,605
It's the same thing with stupidity.

1069
01:25:53,701 --> 01:25:55,772
lam a genius child.

1070
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:58,506
But tonight I am here

1071
01:25:59,134 --> 01:26:01,671
because of my parents' stupidity.

1072
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:07,572
So that Dr. Forni can prove
that brilliance is not hereditary.

1073
01:26:11,834 --> 01:26:13,905
He's another example of this.

1074
01:26:14,034 --> 01:26:16,537
Because his father is exceptionally gifted.

1075
01:26:17,567 --> 01:26:18,944
And he's not.

1076
01:26:20,634 --> 01:26:25,640
What is the point of being intelligent
if I don't know what to be or do?

1077
01:26:36,534 --> 01:26:40,004
You can also use this footage as you please,

1078
01:26:40,134 --> 01:26:41,977
because I quit!

1079
01:26:51,567 --> 01:26:53,547
<i>Sometimes you have to leave</i>

1080
01:26:53,667 --> 01:26:55,476
<i>in order to want to come back.</i>

1081
01:26:56,534 --> 01:26:57,877
Sweetie!

1082
01:27:18,534 --> 01:27:21,014
<i>Why don't you worry about Ram'?</i>

1083
01:27:26,067 --> 01:27:28,604
You can still do something
meaningful with your life.

1084
01:27:29,567 --> 01:27:30,671
Life...

1085
01:27:33,467 --> 01:27:35,606
Life is very long.

1086
01:27:38,534 --> 01:27:42,607
Whoever says it's brief is an idiot!

1087
01:27:44,534 --> 01:27:46,775
This is endless!

1088
01:27:50,067 --> 01:27:51,671
The early bird...

1089
01:27:54,701 --> 01:27:56,681
<i>Finds all the stores closed.</i>

1090
01:28:48,201 --> 01:28:49,703
<i>Sometimes answers</i>

1091
01:28:49,834 --> 01:28:52,747
<i>come from where you least expect them.</i>

1092
01:29:04,034 --> 01:29:07,641
<i>I learned that you have to find your own path</i>

1093
01:29:07,767 --> 01:29:09,212
<i>to happiness.</i>

1094
01:29:21,567 --> 01:29:24,173
<i>In life, as you correctly said,</i>

1095
01:29:24,501 --> 01:29:26,572
<i>you have to love what you do</i>

1096
01:29:30,167 --> 01:29:32,704
<i>and love what comes your way.</i>

1097
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:38,943
<i>Mr. G, I still don't know what I want to be.</i>

1098
01:29:39,067 --> 01:29:41,104
<i>But now I know what I am.</i>

1099
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:43,740
<i>A kid.</i>

1100
01:29:58,767 --> 01:29:59,939
What?

1101
01:30:00,634 --> 01:30:02,238
Those kids are your friends?

1102
01:30:02,567 --> 01:30:03,978
Like Einstein said,

1103
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:07,980
"The most important thing
is to never stop questioning."
