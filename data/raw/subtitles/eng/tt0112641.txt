I don`t know if I could do this
even if I wanted to.

166
00:11:05,028 --> 00:11:06,771
The Gaming Commission
would never give me a license.

167
00:11:06,863 --> 00:11:09,319
I have at least two dozen
gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.

168
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:13,031
You don`t have to have a license
to work in a casino.

169
00:11:13,077 --> 00:11:15,201
All you gotta do
is apply for one.

170
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:17,577
The state law says that
you can work in a casino...

171
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,705
while they`re processing
your application.

172
00:11:19,793 --> 00:11:21,702
They got a ten-year backlog.

173
00:11:21,795 --> 00:11:23,704
What happens when
they do find out?

174
00:11:23,797 --> 00:11:25,755
Why would they
want to find out?

175
00:11:25,841 --> 00:11:28,758
We`re puttin` a hundred million
into this desert.
Why would they want to lock us out?

176
00:11:28,844 --> 00:11:32,712
They`ll never find out. All you gotta do
is keep changing your job title.

177
00:11:32,765 --> 00:11:37,308
Like, uh, from Casino Executive
to Food and Beverage Chairman.

178
00:11:37,394 --> 00:11:40,597
They take your application,
they put it at the bottom of the pile.

179
00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:43,856
I know guys been workin` there
for 30 years, don`t have a license.

180
00:11:45,862 --> 00:11:48,317
It`s a tough proposition, Andy.

181
00:11:48,405 --> 00:11:50,315
You know if I did it,
I`d have to run it my way.

182
00:11:50,408 --> 00:11:52,151
You got it.

183
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:54,739
I`m serious, no interference.

184
00:11:54,787 --> 00:11:57,112
Nobody`s gonna interfere
with your running the casino.

185
00:11:57,206 --> 00:11:59,495
I guarantee it.

186
00:12:01,752 --> 00:12:04,078
[ Nicky ] And that`s how
they got Ace to take over.

187
00:12:04,172 --> 00:12:08,964
They wanted him because Ace ate,
slept and breathed gambling.

188
00:12:11,596 --> 00:12:14,087
They worked out
a real cute job title too...

189
00:12:14,141 --> 00:12:17,094
Tangiers Public Relations Director.

190
00:12:17,143 --> 00:12:20,595
But the only thing he ever
directed was the casino.

191
00:12:20,647 --> 00:12:24,016
He made his first bet when he was
15 years old, and he always made money.

192
00:12:24,108 --> 00:12:26,600
But he didn`t bet
like you or me.

193
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:29,399
You know, havin` some fun
with it, shit like that.

194
00:12:29,447 --> 00:12:31,523
Where the hell
did you learn how to deal?

195
00:12:31,616 --> 00:12:34,368
He bet like a fuckin`
brain surgeon.

196
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:36,611
Place the checks properly.

197
00:12:36,663 --> 00:12:38,572
- That`s the way you do it.
- Yes, sir.

198
00:12:38,665 --> 00:12:40,409
He had to know everything,
this guy.

199
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,618
He`d find out the kind
of inside stuff nobody else knew...

200
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,421
and that`s what he`d put
his money on.

201
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,382
Even back home, years ago...

202
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,376
when we were first hangin` out...

203
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:53,042
he`d know if the quarterback
was on coke...

204
00:12:53,138 --> 00:12:54,882
I`ll take Columbia for 20.

205
00:12:54,932 --> 00:12:57,055
- if his girlfriend was knocked up.
- Twenty dimes on Columbia.

206
00:12:57,143 --> 00:13:00,476
He`d get the wind velocity
so he could judge the field goals.

207
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:02,395
He even figured out
the different bounce...

208
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:04,390
you got off the different kinds
of wood they used...

209
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,392
on college basketball courts,
you know?

210
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,395
He`d be workin`
on this shit day and night.

211
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,730
There was nothing about a game
he was gonna bet that he didn`t know.

212
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:13,231
Ace got down at six.
Get me down at six.

213
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,995
Season after season...

214
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,699
the prick was the only
guaranteed winner I ever knew.

215
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:20,699
But he was so serious
about it all...

216
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,117
that I don`t think
he ever enjoyed himself.

217
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,293
But that`s just the way he was.

218
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:28,090
But back then, the bosses
didn`t give a fuck...

219
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,214
about whether
he enjoyed himself or not.

220
00:13:30,302 --> 00:13:33,219
To them, he was
a cash register.

221
00:13:33,304 --> 00:13:35,974
All they had to do was
ring the bell and take money.

222
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:37,759
Especially Remo...

223
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:40,216
who was a fuckin` degenerate
gambler who always lost...

All those fuckin` sweeps.

226
00:13:44,983 --> 00:13:47,900
- unless Ace made his bets.
- Enough now!

227
00:13:47,986 --> 00:13:49,979
Ace made more money
for them on a weekend...

228
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,150
than I could do heisting
joints for a month.

229
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,655
Whatever Ace picked up
on the street, he told Remo.

230
00:13:57,204 --> 00:13:59,493
I mean, fixed fights,
doped horses...

232
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,834
He told fuckin` Remo everything.

233
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:08,081
And to tell you the truth,
I don`t blame him.

234
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:10,249
- Hey!
- Keepin` Remo happy with money...

00:14:10,342 --> 00:14:12,549

You beat Nicky with fists,
he comes back with a bat.

You beat him with a knife,
he comes back with a gun.

And if you beat him with a gun,
you better kill him...

00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:06,141
so, hey, why not
take advantage of it.

327
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,679
Still, the politicians came cheap.
We could handle them.

328
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:12,187
It`s a whale
like K.K. Ichikawa...

329
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:15,105
who plays $30,000 a hand
in baccarat...

330
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,235
that`s the one
you really gotta watch.

331
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,656
He plays fast and big
and he has the cash and the credit...

332
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,652
to turn out your lights.

333
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:26,659
About a year ago he cleaned out a couple
of casinos in the Cayman lslands.

334
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:28,789
Downstairs he takes us
for two million...

335
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:33,088
and upstairs he takes free
soap, shampoo and towels.

336
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,752
Another billionaire cheapskate
who loved his free rooms...

337
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,928
free private jets and
two million of our money.

338
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:42,427
But we got him back.

339
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:44,964
I had our pilot tell him
the plane was on the fritz.

340
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,218
I don`t know what the hell went wrong.
I`m awfully sorry.

341
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:50,437
I can`t understand it. These mechanical
things, you know they happen.

342
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:53,055
Hey, but better here than
up there, you know what I mean.

343
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,725
Then he missed the commercial
flights connecting with Japan.

344
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,944
I can`t believe that there`s
a convention; there`s no room.

345
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:06,319
We got him back with a whole floor
of rooms to himself.

346
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:09,369
- I`m sorry you missed your plane.
- Glad to get to know you.

347
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,702
Oh, no. No gambling.

348
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:17,335
And once he was back,
he played small.

349
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,470
He bet 1,000 a hand,
instead of his usual 30,000 a hand.

350
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:26,469
...to the bank
with a natural lead over a five.

351
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:29,685
But I knew the trick
with whales like lchikawa...

352
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,731
was that they can`t bet
small for long.

353
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:34,725
He didn`t think of it
as winning 10,000...

354
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:38,069
he thought of it
as losing 90,000.

355
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:41,072
So, he upped his bets.

356
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:48,242
Until he dropped his winnings back
and gave up a million of his own cash.

357
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:53,578
In the casino, the cardinal rule
is to keep them playing...

358
00:20:53,672 --> 00:20:55,747
and keep them coming back.

359
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,212
The longer they play,
the more they lose.

360
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:00,585
In the end, we get it all.

361
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:03,549
÷ Goddamn it
Trying to make it real ÷

362
00:21:03,598 --> 00:21:05,555
÷ Compared to what ÷

363
00:21:06,685 --> 00:21:08,724
÷ Sock it to me ÷

364
00:21:10,021 --> 00:21:13,722
In Vegas, everybody`s
gotta watch everybody else.

365
00:21:13,817 --> 00:21:16,058
Six. All right,
who`s gonna give me that?

366
00:21:16,152 --> 00:21:18,062
Since the players are looking
to beat the casino...

367
00:21:18,154 --> 00:21:20,728
Each and every roll,
all right.

368
00:21:20,782 --> 00:21:23,736
- the dealers are watching
the players...
- Six.

369
00:21:23,785 --> 00:21:27,570
- Fake a six.
- the boxmen are watching the dealers.

370
00:21:27,623 --> 00:21:30,493
the floormen are watching
the boxmen...

371
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:33,289
the pit bosses are watching
the floormen...

372
00:21:33,378 --> 00:21:36,248
the shift bosses are watching
the pit bosses...

373
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:39,210
the casino manager is watching
the shift bosses...

374
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:41,466
I`m watching the casino manager...

375
00:21:41,554 --> 00:21:44,720
and the eye in the sky
is watching us all.

376
00:21:49,186 --> 00:21:51,095
Plus, we had
a dozen guys up there...

377
00:21:51,188 --> 00:21:54,604
most of them ex-cheats, who knew
every trick in the house.

378
00:22:02,617 --> 00:22:05,024
÷ Tryin` to make it real
compared to what ÷

379
00:22:14,879 --> 00:22:16,789
Yes!

380
00:22:16,881 --> 00:22:19,633
- Very nice.
- I told you I was hot tonight.

381
00:22:31,647 --> 00:22:33,639
Lookin` good.
Lookin` good.

382
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,647
Let`s go.
This is for Ginger. Come on.

383
00:22:35,692 --> 00:22:37,649
Let me have a hundred
on your hard ten.

384
00:22:37,694 --> 00:22:39,651
Hundred on your hard ten.
Thank you.

385
00:22:39,696 --> 00:22:43,279
Here we go now.
Yeeeow!

386
00:22:53,877 --> 00:22:56,997
- Oh, I`m sorry.
- The dice--

387
00:22:57,089 --> 00:22:59,960
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

388
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:02,499
- Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.
- You were great.

389
00:23:02,594 --> 00:23:05,512
Thanks. Take care, Steve.
Take chances, drive fast.

390
00:23:05,556 --> 00:23:08,889
This hundred is for you, love.
Thanks for your time.

391
00:23:10,603 --> 00:23:12,679
- Come on.
- What`s the matter?

392
00:23:12,772 --> 00:23:16,354
What do you mean? I made a lot
of money for you, I want my cut.

393
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,523
What money? I`ve seen
you stealing from me.

394
00:23:18,611 --> 00:23:20,520
What money?
Look at the stack of chips.

395
00:23:20,613 --> 00:23:22,854
- I want my half.
- I`ve been watching you all night.

396
00:23:22,907 --> 00:23:25,363
- I want my money.
- Your bag is full of fucking chips.

397
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:28,197
- I didn`t steal anything from you.
- Get lost!

398
00:23:28,288 --> 00:23:30,861
Get lost? Get lost?
Yes! Yes!

399
00:23:30,957 --> 00:23:34,575
- Well, how about that?
- Come on!

400
00:23:36,379 --> 00:23:38,917
÷ Slippin` and a-slidin` ÷
Changin` and a-hidin` ÷

401
00:23:39,007 --> 00:23:41,379
÷ Been told a long time ago ÷

402
00:23:41,426 --> 00:23:44,130
÷ I been told
Baby, you`ve been born ÷

403
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,462
÷ I won`t be your fool no more
Oww ÷

404
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:59,897
÷ Baby, oh, baby ÷

405
00:23:59,945 --> 00:24:03,859
÷ My sweet baby ÷

406
00:24:03,907 --> 00:24:05,070
÷ You`re the one ÷

407
00:24:24,345 --> 00:24:26,254
[ Ace ] What a move.

408
00:24:26,346 --> 00:24:28,256
I fell in love right there.

409
00:24:28,349 --> 00:24:31,386
But in Vegas, for a girl
like Ginger, love costs money.

410
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:35,303
÷ What`s different about him ÷

411
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:37,058
÷ I don`t really know ÷

412
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:39,183
I`m gonna go powder my nose.

413
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,229
÷ No matter how I try ÷

414
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:50,075
÷ I just can`t make him cry ÷

415
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:54,071
- [ Ace ] Ginger`s mission
in life was money.
- I`ll be right back.

416
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,082
- See you, Ginger.
- Okay, thank you for asking.

417
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,871
She was a queen
around the casino.

418
00:24:57,921 --> 00:24:59,664
She brought in high rollers...

419
00:24:59,714 --> 00:25:01,837
and helped them spread
around a lot of money.

420
00:25:01,883 --> 00:25:04,006
- Hello.
- Hey, Ginger. How you doing?

421
00:25:04,094 --> 00:25:06,502
Great, and I have something for you.
You got me covered?

422
00:25:06,596 --> 00:25:09,467
- And you do. Thank you very much.
- Take care of yourself.

423
00:25:09,516 --> 00:25:12,138
- I got some lucky pills for you, Andy.
- Oh, yeah.

424
00:25:12,227 --> 00:25:14,634
Who didn`t want Ginger?
She was one of the best known...

425
00:25:14,687 --> 00:25:17,938
best liked and
most respected hustlers in town.

426
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,396
Smart hustlers like her
could keep a guy awake...

427
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,648
for two or three days
before sending him home broke...

428
00:25:26,742 --> 00:25:28,818
to the little woman
and his bank examiners.

429
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:31,616
÷ You only make me glad ÷

430
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:36,829
÷ Better listen, little girl ÷

431
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:40,584
÷ You`re goin` walkin`
down the street ÷

432
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:44,373
÷ I ain`t got no love ÷

433
00:25:44,468 --> 00:25:47,006
Any change?

434
00:25:47,054 --> 00:25:51,965
Oh, I hit a few games
on the way back.

435
00:25:52,018 --> 00:25:54,770
But that was all bullshit.
She just pocketed the cash.

436
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:56,229
÷ This heart of stone ÷

437
00:25:57,857 --> 00:25:59,814
- How you doin` tonight?
- Good.

438
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:01,899
- How are you?
- Uh, beat.

439
00:26:01,987 --> 00:26:04,524
- [ Ace ] Ginger had the hustlers code.
- Take one for you.

440
00:26:04,614 --> 00:26:07,650
- Thank you.
- She knew how to take care of people.

441
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:10,191
And that`s what Vegas
is all about.

442
00:26:10,244 --> 00:26:13,162
- Sixty-eight hundred.
- Thanks.

443
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:15,614
- It`s kickback city.
- Have a good night.

444
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:17,540
Thank you. You too.

445
00:26:21,506 --> 00:26:23,499
- She took care of the dealers...
- Hey, Mitch.

446
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,670
pit bosses, floor managers...

447
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,677
but, mostly, she took care
of the valet parkers...

448
00:26:28,722 --> 00:26:32,221
the guys who could get you anything
and take care of anything.

449
00:26:32,267 --> 00:26:34,010
Ginger took care of the parkers...

450
00:26:34,061 --> 00:26:36,219
because they took care
of the security guards...

451
00:26:36,271 --> 00:26:39,889
- who took care of the metro cops,
who let her operate.
- I need that stuff tonight.

452
00:26:39,941 --> 00:26:43,275
- No problem.
- You are a doll.

453
00:26:43,362 --> 00:26:45,271
The valet parking job
was such a money-maker...

454
00:26:45,363 --> 00:26:49,029
they had to pay off the hotel manager
just to get the concession.

455
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:51,745
But one thing
I just could never understand...

456
00:26:51,828 --> 00:26:54,236
was that she could have
everything under control...

457
00:26:54,331 --> 00:26:57,416
except for her old pimp
boyfriend, Lester Diamond.

458
00:26:57,501 --> 00:27:01,581
Gin, you know I got other people
in this, they got partners.

459
00:27:01,672 --> 00:27:03,712
I want you to understand
that I am looking out for you...

460
00:27:03,758 --> 00:27:05,715
in this thing, okay?

461
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,129
You`re gonna get yours back,
and you`re gonna get back first, okay?

462
00:27:09,221 --> 00:27:12,508
- All right, yeah.
- Where you going?

463
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,889
Where are you? You`re
in that place. Where are you?

464
00:27:14,935 --> 00:27:16,928
- I`m here.
- No, you`re not.

465
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,478
Where are you?
Where are you?

466
00:27:20,566 --> 00:27:23,271
I`m always here for you.

467
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:26,190
- You`re my woman.
- I know.

468
00:27:26,281 --> 00:27:30,195
[ Ace ] The Ginger I knew wouldn`t
even look at this creep.

469
00:27:30,285 --> 00:27:32,361
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

470
00:27:32,454 --> 00:27:34,362
He was a moocher,
a card cheat...

471
00:27:34,455 --> 00:27:37,125
a country club golf hustler,
a scumbag.

472
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:39,830
- Chasing dentists for a few bucks.
- Careful.

473
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,291
The guy was always broke.
He always had a story.

474
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,872
And somehow she could never
turn him down.

475
00:27:44,966 --> 00:27:47,801
The way Ginger saw it, I guess,
was that Lester was just an unlucky guy.

476
00:27:47,844 --> 00:27:49,967
Somebody had
to take care of him.

477
00:27:50,347 --> 00:27:54,131
But nobody
had to take care of Nicky.

478
00:27:54,226 --> 00:27:57,061
lf you find any cash in there,
we`ll whack it up with you.

479
00:27:57,145 --> 00:27:59,055
I mean, he took care
of himself only too well.

480
00:27:59,148 --> 00:28:02,812
- That`s why every badge...
- I folded these things beautifully.

481
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:04,852
- back home wanted to nail him.
- I would appreciate a little respect.

482
00:28:04,945 --> 00:28:07,863
- Look at me, pal,
I gotta live with her.
- Jesus Christ.

483
00:28:07,949 --> 00:28:09,857
÷ Volare ÷

484
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,859
Even after a little vacation,
they hassled him at the airport.

485
00:28:11,952 --> 00:28:14,491
I mean, Frank Marino was there
to meet him, but so were the cops.

486
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,786
This time they wanted
to pinch him...

487
00:28:16,832 --> 00:28:18,991
- for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
- Will you help me fold these?

488
00:28:19,043 --> 00:28:21,202
They were ready to blame him for
anything, no matter where it happened.

- Put your things away.
- And they were usually right.

490
00:28:23,589 --> 00:28:27,172
- Hold it, hold it. Here.
- Because Nicky enjoyed
being a gangster.

491
00:28:27,218 --> 00:28:29,460
- And he didn`t give a damn who knew it.
- Come on, there we go.

492

Look at this. Beautiful!

493
00:28:33,182 --> 00:28:37,559
I mean, that`s what worried me.
`Cause it turns out,
Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.

494

- All right, we`re clear.
- There`s more.

There`s a couple stuck in there.
I know there`s more.

- I`m telling you, they`re out!
- Come on.

497

Don`t get so defensive,
it could be stuck in your hair.

498

What`s that?
Huh, what`s that?

Thanks, hon.

[ Nicky ] I couldn`t wait to get
my hands on Vegas.

But the bosses didn`t send me
out there to have a good time.

502

They sent me out there to make sure
that nobody fucked with Ace.

And nobody interfered
with the fuckin` skim.

Hey, Sammy.

506

- Boy, look at this place, huh?
- lncredible.

507

- Okay, Sammy.
- Something, huh?

Holy shit. What`ve you
been doing out here?

This is Jennifer and Nick,
they`re dear friends of mine.

- A pleasure.

514

Okay, Sammy.

515

[ Ace ] After we ate,
we left Jennifer and Ginger alone...

516

And then, he hit me with it.

518
00:29:49,677 --> 00:29:52,382
What do you think about me
moving out here?

519
00:29:53,932 --> 00:29:55,888
What`s the matter?
You got a problem with that?

520
00:29:55,933 --> 00:30:00,062
- No, of course not.
- You mean, I have your permission?

521
00:30:00,105 --> 00:30:02,939
Sure, you have my permission.
But I just gotta tell you...

522
00:30:02,982 --> 00:30:04,940
it`s no joke out here,
it`s no joke.

523
00:30:05,026 --> 00:30:07,103
You gotta keep a low profile.

524
00:30:07,195 --> 00:30:09,982
It`s not like back home. Right off
the bat, they don`t like guys like us.

525
00:30:10,073 --> 00:30:12,445
And this sheriff`s
a real cowboy.

526
00:30:12,534 --> 00:30:15,451
Even the coppers aren`t afraid
to bury people out in the desert here.

527
00:30:15,536 --> 00:30:18,110
I don`t care. I wanna get away
from back home for a while.

528
00:30:18,206 --> 00:30:20,116
I`m tired of that shit
back there.

529
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:22,117
Look at this place.
It`s made of money.

530
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:25,626
You know what the best part is?
Nobody`s gonna know what we`re doing.

531
00:30:25,672 --> 00:30:28,590
There`s nobody here to see us.
Everybody`s back home.

532
00:30:28,634 --> 00:30:30,792
Nick, I gotta tell you.
I got pinched twice for no reason.

533
00:30:30,844 --> 00:30:32,801
I really gotta be careful.

534

I`m running a licensed place,
everything`s legit.

535

Don`t worry about it.
I`m not gonna do anything.

00:30:37,893 --> 00:30:40,978
I`m especially not gonna
involve you in anything.

[ Nicky ]
Ace saw Vegas one way...

538
00:30:45,818 --> 00:30:49,021
- You call this guy
and tell him I`m comin`?
- Of course.

539
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:51,864
but I saw it another.

540
00:30:51,907 --> 00:30:54,315
I saw it as untouched.

541
00:30:54,368 --> 00:30:56,326
I mean, they had bookies, pimps...

542
00:30:56,371 --> 00:30:58,446
and drug dealers
I could shake down.

543
00:30:58,497 --> 00:31:00,455
Who the fuck
were they gonna run to?

544
00:31:00,499 --> 00:31:02,374
So I started gettin`
everybody in line.

545
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,164
Best of all,
for the first time in my life...

546
00:31:05,254 --> 00:31:07,745
I figured out a way
not to lose.

547
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,047
[ Ace ] Yeah, he had
a foolproof scheme, all right.

548
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:12,091
It wasn`t very scientific,
but it worked.

549
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:14,093
When he won, he collected;

550
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:16,808
when he lost, he told the bookies
to go fuck themselves.

551
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:20,265
What were they gonna do,
muscle Nicky?

552
00:31:20,353 --> 00:31:22,891
- Hey, how you doin`?
- How you doin`?

553

- You got that thing for me?
- What thing?

- I`m positive.

- I`m a little confused.
- You`re a little confused?

Maybe if I stick your fuckin`
face through this window...

559

you`ll get unconfused.

- Gimme the fuckin` money.
- I`m sorry, Nick.

That`s why you had it ready.
You thought I was fuckin` layin` it?

- My fuckin` head.
- Smarten up.

And now Nicholas Santoro will come up
and tell us about our first president.

it was nice and quiet for a while.

Nicky and Jennifer all over town...

a beautiful swing.

But it didn`t matter.
It was all about the kids.

574

He`s gotta realize that everything
can`t be a home run that he does.

That`s exactly what
I keep tellin` him...

he made his presence known.

Especially at the casino,
where he definitely did not work...

00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:50,158
That Black Book
is a bunch of bullshit.

983
00:54:50,252 --> 00:54:52,209
They got two names
from the whole country...

984
00:54:52,254 --> 00:54:54,294
and one of `em
is still Al Capone.

985
00:54:54,382 --> 00:54:57,715
lf they put you in that book,
you`re gonna be in trouble.

986
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,085
You will not be able
to walk into a casino.

987
00:55:00,179 --> 00:55:02,670
I`m trying to make a living,
that`s all.

988
00:55:02,765 --> 00:55:05,552
I`m just tellin` you.
Don`t say I didn`t warn you.

989
00:55:05,601 --> 00:55:07,559
All right.

990
00:55:11,816 --> 00:55:15,102
[ Man ] Mrs. Rothstein,
straight ahead. Very nice.

991
00:55:15,153 --> 00:55:17,394
Thank you.

992
00:55:17,446 --> 00:55:19,902
[ Chattering ]

993
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:22,441
[ Man ] For his hard work
and dedication...

994
00:55:22,494 --> 00:55:25,697
and the new life blood
he has instilled in Las Vegas...

995
00:55:25,788 --> 00:55:28,541
Sam has established himself
as an indispensable member...

996
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:31,080
of the gaming community.

997
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:33,453
As the head of the
Tangiers Gaming Corporation...

998
00:55:33,546 --> 00:55:35,954
it`s my pleasure
to welcome Sam Rothstein...

999
00:55:36,049 --> 00:55:38,255
to the Vegas Valley
Country Club.

1000
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:40,757
[ Applause ]

1001
00:55:43,474 --> 00:55:47,341
[ Ace ] Back home, they would`ve put me
in jail for what I`m doing.

1002
00:55:47,436 --> 00:55:50,685
But out here,
they`re giving me awards.

1003
00:55:50,772 --> 00:55:55,150
It is with great pleasure that I accept
this certificate of appreciation...

1004
00:55:55,194 --> 00:55:57,766
for charitable donations
to greater Las Vegas.

1005
00:55:57,821 --> 00:56:00,027
Congratulations, sweetheart.

1006
00:56:00,115 --> 00:56:03,485
Sam raised more than
we`ve ever raised before.

1007
00:56:03,577 --> 00:56:08,038
But my greatest pleasure was watching
my wife, Ginger, work the room.

1008
00:56:08,123 --> 00:56:11,659
- [ Chattering ]
- They all loved her.
How could you not love her?

1009
00:56:11,752 --> 00:56:14,325
She could be the most
charming woman you ever saw.

1010
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,419
People loved
to be around her.

1011
00:56:16,507 --> 00:56:19,424
You`ve got to bring Amy
to Sasha`s birthday party.

1012
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:22,083
We`d love to have you there.

1013
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:24,172
- Yes, okay.
- Great.

1014
00:56:24,223 --> 00:56:26,678
She made everybody feel good.

1015
00:56:26,725 --> 00:56:31,139
÷ That`s Stella by starlight ÷

1016
00:56:31,189 --> 00:56:33,311
Congratulations, Sam.

1017
00:56:33,357 --> 00:56:35,315
Oh, thanks.

1018
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,685
- Hello, Mrs. Rothstein. How are you?
- Hi.

1019
00:56:40,072 --> 00:56:42,908
You`re one of the most
gorgeous women I`ve ever seen.

1020
00:56:42,992 --> 00:56:45,698
You`re a lucky man,
Mr. Rothstein.

1021
00:56:47,789 --> 00:56:50,031
Thank you.
Thanks for that compliment.

1022
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:52,414
He was a young kid
from the casino.

1023
00:56:52,502 --> 00:56:54,708
Nice kid.
Bright boy.

1024
00:56:54,754 --> 00:56:58,088
What balls on this fuckin` kid!
The next day I fired him.

1025
00:56:58,175 --> 00:57:03,086
Ginger had that effect on people.
I think she even encouraged them.

1026
00:57:03,179 --> 00:57:06,763
Do you wanna see this one?
Ahhhh!

1027
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:11,062
Daddy gave me all this jewelry
because he loves me so much.

1028
00:57:11,104 --> 00:57:13,892
- But as much as they loved her...
- Oh, fabulous!

1029
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:16,390
they didn`t know
what really moved her.

1030
00:57:16,443 --> 00:57:20,358
Look at this. Look at this.
Daddy gave me this--

1031
00:57:20,406 --> 00:57:24,949
And with Ginger happy, I was able
to concentrate on what I knew best.

1032
00:57:25,035 --> 00:57:27,491
Loose machines are
right back over there.

1033
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:30,664
What are they doin` back there?
You can`t even see `em there.

1034
00:57:30,749 --> 00:57:34,249
- Okay, I`ll--
- What about the progressives
with the high jackpots?

1035
00:57:34,337 --> 00:57:37,871
- Well--
- These are our best machines.
They bring all the action.

1036
00:57:37,923 --> 00:57:40,082
- No wonder the drop is off.
- Yeah, okay.

1037
00:57:40,134 --> 00:57:43,088
- The action is in the front.
Bring `em up front.
- All right, I will.

1038
00:57:43,137 --> 00:57:46,138
Listen to me very carefully. There are
three ways of doing things around here:

1039
00:57:46,224 --> 00:57:48,976
the right way, the wrong way
and the way that I do it.

1040
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:52,844
- You understand?
- I do understand that.
I`ll get right on it.

1041
00:57:52,939 --> 00:57:56,439
- And thank you.
- Don`t thank me. Just do it.

1042
00:57:56,526 --> 00:57:59,692
You`re the slots manager.
I shouldn`t have to tell you this.

1043
00:57:59,779 --> 00:58:03,030
Dang, you are right,
Mr. Rothstein. I am so sorry.

1044
00:58:03,116 --> 00:58:06,699
[ Ace ] So I ended up working--
what, 18-hour days.

1045
00:58:06,786 --> 00:58:10,037
Ginger was the one who wound up
enjoying the best of Vegas.

1046
00:58:10,123 --> 00:58:13,290
Come with me, please.
I have a better table for you.

1047
00:58:13,376 --> 00:58:16,046
What did you say to that
fucking jerk, anyway?

1048
00:58:16,129 --> 00:58:18,620
I told him I was
Mrs. Sam Rothstein.

1049
00:58:18,673 --> 00:58:22,007
[ Chuckles ] Well, you might
as well get something out of it.

1050
00:58:24,388 --> 00:58:26,427
[ Ace ]
Well, it wasn`t long...

1051
00:58:26,473 --> 00:58:29,047
before what I was afraid
was gonna happen happened.

1052
00:58:29,143 --> 00:58:33,057
Nicky managed to get himself banned
from every casino in Las Vegas.

1053
00:58:33,146 --> 00:58:37,061
And from then on,
I couldn`t be seen talking
to him anywhere in Vegas or near it.

1054
00:58:37,151 --> 00:58:40,068
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

1055
00:58:40,153 --> 00:58:44,068
"He will be ejected from
any casino in Las Vegas.

1056
00:58:44,158 --> 00:58:48,321
And the casinos can be fined
as much as $100,000...

1057
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:50,826
every time he shows up."

1058
00:58:50,873 --> 00:58:54,158
- You believe this shit?
- Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.

1059
00:58:54,251 --> 00:58:57,703
"Because of notorious
and unsavory reputation--"

1060
00:58:57,797 --> 00:59:00,466
Motherfucker!

1061
00:59:00,507 --> 00:59:03,177
ls there any way
around this?

1062
00:59:03,261 --> 00:59:06,013
No, there`s no way.

1063
00:59:06,056 --> 00:59:09,175
Let`s say, for instance...

1064
00:59:09,267 --> 00:59:12,767
I wanna go in a restaurant,
which happens to be in the casino...

1065
00:59:12,854 --> 00:59:14,763
to get one of those
sandwiches I like?

1066
00:59:14,855 --> 00:59:18,521
Forget it. You can`t even
set foot in the parking lot.

1067
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:21,017
That`s how serious it is.

1068
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:24,404
In other words,
I`m fucked?

1069
00:59:24,491 --> 00:59:26,863
In so many words, yes.

1070
00:59:26,952 --> 00:59:31,080
It just didn`t sink into his head
about the Black Book and what it meant.

1071
00:59:31,164 --> 00:59:34,082
Not being able to go
into a casino is one thing...

1072
00:59:34,168 --> 00:59:38,710
but being in this book
etched your name into the brains
of every cop and FBl agent.

1073
00:59:38,797 --> 00:59:42,545
I mean, you`re listed in there
with Al Capone. But Nicky didn`t care.

1074
00:59:42,592 --> 00:59:46,211
I gotta do something.
They ain`t gettin` rid of me.

1075
00:59:46,263 --> 00:59:49,015
They`re not gettin` rid of me.
I`m stayin` here.

1076
00:59:49,057 --> 00:59:51,513
Fuck `em. Fuck `em.

1077
00:59:55,731 --> 00:59:58,304
[ Nicky ]
So, once they pulled that shit...

1078
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,567
I started doin` my own things
nobody ever thought of doin`.

1079
01:00:01,612 --> 01:00:06,570
To keep an eye on things,
I brought in my kid brother,
Dominick, and some desperados...

1080
01:00:06,617 --> 01:00:09,572
and started knockin` over
high-rollers, casino bosses...

1081
01:00:09,621 --> 01:00:12,407
bookmakers--
anybody right here in town.

1082
01:00:12,456 --> 01:00:15,126
I had a good fuckin` crew goin`
for me, I`ll tell you that.

1083
01:00:15,209 --> 01:00:18,874
I had Sal Fusco,
a great second-story guy.

1084
01:00:18,921 --> 01:00:23,880
Jack Hardy. He worked for a safe company
before he did a six-year bit.

1085
01:00:23,927 --> 01:00:28,719
And then there was Bernie Blue.
This guy can bypass any alarm for me.

1086
01:00:28,765 --> 01:00:31,386
It was like old times.

1087
01:00:31,434 --> 01:00:36,061
And I opened up my own jewelry
store too, the "Gold Rush."

1088
01:00:36,106 --> 01:00:39,557
Sometimes I used to go along
on a heist, just for the fun of it.

1089
01:00:39,609 --> 01:00:42,563
But I didn`t like the people
I was rippin` off looking at me...

1090
01:00:42,612 --> 01:00:45,399
so I used to turn
their fuckin` pictures around.

1091
01:00:45,448 --> 01:00:48,402
- What`s takin` so long?
- This is a motherfucker!

1092
01:00:48,451 --> 01:00:52,663
- It`s working.
- Learn how to open these things
so you don`t have to take `em.

1093
01:00:52,747 --> 01:00:55,583
Some of these stones
got a lot of niggers in them.

1094
01:00:55,625 --> 01:00:59,125
Tell Pepe if he`s
switching stones on us,
he better take a camel back to Nigeria.

1095
01:00:59,212 --> 01:01:01,501
- [ Phone Rings ]
- Yeah?

1096
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:03,832
- They`re in Penthouse K.
- Check in alone?

1097
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:06,002
- They checked in alone.
- Are they out now?

1098
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:08,965
- Yes. Don`t worry.
- All right. Thanks.

1099
01:01:09,014 --> 01:01:11,766
[ Ace ] He had tipsters
all over town. Bellmen.

1100
01:01:11,809 --> 01:01:14,478
- But you got to hurry.
- Yeah, okay.

1101
01:01:14,561 --> 01:01:16,684
- Valet parkers.
- They`re just checking in now.

1102
01:01:16,772 --> 01:01:18,682
Okay, I`ll tell him.

1103
01:01:18,774 --> 01:01:20,683
- Pit bosses.
- Room 1230 at the Scirocco.

1104
01:01:20,776 --> 01:01:22,685
- 1230. Right.
- Secretaries.

1105
01:01:22,778 --> 01:01:25,982
- Mint condition coins.
- Mint condition? All right.

1106
01:01:26,074 --> 01:01:27,401
And they all got
a piece of the score.

1107
01:01:27,449 --> 01:01:30,285
Car`s coming.

1108
01:01:30,786 --> 01:01:33,456
÷÷ [ Hard Rock ]

1109
01:01:33,498 --> 01:01:35,620
They were very careful.

1110
01:01:35,666 --> 01:01:38,240
They always bypassed
the alarms, or else...

1111
01:01:38,336 --> 01:01:42,748
if not, they`d drill
enough holes to knock
through the walls with a sledgehammer.

1112
01:01:44,008 --> 01:01:46,131
Nicky was grabbing
everything he could.

1113
01:01:46,177 --> 01:01:49,925
Nobody out there was expecting
a guy like him.

1114
01:01:51,349 --> 01:01:54,054
For Nicky, Las Vegas
was the fucking wild west.

1115
01:01:54,144 --> 01:01:56,551
I just got a shipment
of diamonds from lsrael.

1116
01:01:56,646 --> 01:02:00,514
[ Nicky ] What the fuck they expect
from me? I had to earn, didn`t I?

1117
01:02:00,609 --> 01:02:02,980
You know, this diamond
has flaws in it.

1118
01:02:03,027 --> 01:02:06,527
- There`s no flaws.
- I`m doing this for 25 years.

1119
01:02:06,615 --> 01:02:09,900
You better clean your loupe,
because there`s no flaws.

1120
01:02:09,993 --> 01:02:12,484
[ Nicky ]
Whenever we got local merch...

1121
01:02:12,537 --> 01:02:15,658
we`d usually send it
to Palm Springs or Arizona, L.A.

1122
01:02:15,708 --> 01:02:18,329
I had a couple of sand niggers
out there. You know, Arabs.

1123
01:02:18,376 --> 01:02:20,915
What, are you gonna have
a fucking meeting here?

1124
01:02:21,005 --> 01:02:23,163
I know his language.

1125
01:02:23,215 --> 01:02:25,207
Forty thousand dollars.
The whole package.

1126
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:28,052
Twenty thousand.
That`s my final offer.

1127
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:31,677
He suddenly talks English. Let`s talk
Turkey here. Twenty-five thousand.

1128
01:02:31,723 --> 01:02:34,678
[ Nicky ] I actually turned
my bedroom into a bank vauIt...

1129
01:02:34,727 --> 01:02:37,265
where I kept
the choice stuff.

1130
01:02:37,354 --> 01:02:40,770
I couldn`t leave it
at the Gold Rush...

1131
01:02:40,858 --> 01:02:43,065
in case we got raided
by the cops...

1132
01:02:43,152 --> 01:02:45,061
or if my crew got cute.

1133
01:02:45,112 --> 01:02:48,066
I had the only key.
Jennifer didn`t give a fuck.

1134
01:02:48,115 --> 01:02:51,070
She used to fall asleep
on the couch watching TV.

1135
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:54,784
This stuff was all mine.
I didn`t send any of this back home.

1136
01:02:54,872 --> 01:02:58,076
Actually, I couldn`t, because I wasn`t
even supposed to be doin` it.

1137
01:02:58,126 --> 01:03:01,080
The bosses were making so much
fucking money with the casinos...

1138
01:03:01,129 --> 01:03:04,415
that they didn`t want anybody
makin` any waves for them.

1139
01:03:04,466 --> 01:03:07,087
You gave all the guys
in your crew a piece of that?

1140
01:03:07,135 --> 01:03:09,092
- I took care of everybody.
- Yeah?

1141
01:03:09,137 --> 01:03:13,597
That`s why there was
no real organized street stuff
in Vegas before I came here.

1142
01:03:13,683 --> 01:03:16,601
But how much cash
could I bury in my closet?

1143
01:03:16,645 --> 01:03:19,101
You have to understand,
and I`m sure you do...

1144
01:03:19,148 --> 01:03:21,270
that in a venture
of this kind...

1145
01:03:21,316 --> 01:03:23,772
you have to be prepared
to take some kind of loss.

1146
01:03:23,819 --> 01:03:27,946
So I put some of the money
into legitimate deals
with Charlie Clark, Ace`s banker.

1147
01:03:28,031 --> 01:03:31,732
You will try to push it through,
won`t you, Mr. Clark?

1148
01:03:31,785 --> 01:03:34,454
- Yes.
- I`m giving you 50,000 cash.

1149
01:03:34,537 --> 01:03:37,954
Then I put some more money into
legitimate places, like my restaurant.

1150
01:03:38,042 --> 01:03:39,951
- ls that the last one?
- Yeah.

1151
01:03:40,044 --> 01:03:43,459
I had my kid brother,
Dominick, run it for me.

1152
01:03:43,505 --> 01:03:45,463
Fuckers.

1153
01:03:49,303 --> 01:03:51,296
- Here you go, guys.
- All right.

1154
01:03:51,388 --> 01:03:53,714
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah. Enjoy. Have a good time.

1155
01:03:53,808 --> 01:03:55,800
Choke on it, motherfucker.

1156
01:03:55,851 --> 01:03:57,891
- Hey, Dom.
- How ya doin`?

1157
01:03:57,978 --> 01:04:01,561
[ Ace ] Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants.
He was a real restaurant buff.

1158
01:04:01,648 --> 01:04:04,566
And over the years,
he always made money with it.

1159
01:04:04,652 --> 01:04:08,021
In Vegas, he had the Leaning Tower.
It was a very popular spot.

1160
01:04:08,114 --> 01:04:12,242
He had politicians, showgirls and movie
stars hanging out all over the place.

1161
01:04:12,326 --> 01:04:14,652
That show over at the Flamingo
gets better and better.

1162
01:04:14,746 --> 01:04:18,161
By the way, Sammy said, whenever
you have a minute, give him a call.

1163
01:04:18,249 --> 01:04:21,334
- Made a messenger out of you too, huh?
- Anything for a buck.

1164
01:04:21,419 --> 01:04:24,254
- He does it to everybody.
Enjoy your dinner.
- Thanks.

1165
01:04:24,338 --> 01:04:27,957
[ Ace ]
But I gotta tell you, the thing Nicky
liked most was the showgirls, naturally.

1166
01:04:28,009 --> 01:04:30,761
I mean, to them,
Nicky was the movie star.

1167
01:04:30,845 --> 01:04:33,134
- You walk past me?
- Hey, this is Shelly.

1168
01:04:33,181 --> 01:04:35,139
- Hey, Shelly. How are you?
- Hi.

1169
01:04:35,183 --> 01:04:37,341
- And this is Stacy.
- Stacy.

1170
01:04:37,393 --> 01:04:39,932
- This is Nick. Wanna have dinner?
- Pleasure.

1171
01:04:40,021 --> 01:04:43,521
Let`s check the kitchen first.
Excuse us one second.

1172
01:04:43,608 --> 01:04:46,444
Come on. I`ll show you.
I fly stuff in fresh every day.

1173
01:04:46,528 --> 01:04:49,446
I get bread from back home.
I get fish from California.

1174
01:04:49,531 --> 01:04:53,695
And you can always tell a great kitchen
like ours because of the milk-fed veal.

1175
01:04:53,785 --> 01:04:56,822
That`s the secret.
See, milk-fed veal is pure white.

1176
01:04:56,872 --> 01:05:00,371
Out here they got that pink veal.
Slide over, honey.

1177
01:05:00,417 --> 01:05:04,202
Now, pink veal, you can pound
that shit for two days.

1178
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:07,789
It`ll never, ever get tender.
You know what I mean?

1179
01:05:07,883 --> 01:05:10,885
I left here with the money.
Got muscled on the street.

1180
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:14,054
A couple guys, I owe them.
So I gave them the money.

1181
01:05:14,139 --> 01:05:16,216
- That`s what I did.
- Yeah?

1182
01:05:16,309 --> 01:05:18,551
- Yeah.
- You call yourself a man?

1183
01:05:18,644 --> 01:05:23,353
You know you`re a lyin` lowlife,
motherfuckin` gamblin` degenerate prick?

1184
01:05:23,399 --> 01:05:25,771
You know that`s what you are?
Two small kids at home.

1185
01:05:25,859 --> 01:05:28,066
I gave you money to pay
the fuckin` rent...

1186
01:05:28,154 --> 01:05:30,396
and buy groceries,
put the heat on.

1187
01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:33,775
Your wife called Frankie and
told him the fuckin` heat`s off.

1188
01:05:33,868 --> 01:05:36,075
And you didn`t gamble
that fuckin` money?

1189
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:38,078
- No? You didn`t?
- I didn`t--

1190
01:05:38,164 --> 01:05:41,414
Don`t fuck with me, Al!
Don`t make a fuck outta me.

1191
01:05:41,501 --> 01:05:45,001
You wanna embarrass me and make
a fool outta me? You didn`t gamble?

1192
01:05:45,088 --> 01:05:47,376
Tell me you gambled
the fuckin` money...

1193
01:05:47,423 --> 01:05:50,294
I`ll give you the fuckin` money
to put the fuckin` heat on!

1194
01:05:50,385 --> 01:05:52,711
Did you gamble? Huh?

1195
01:05:55,724 --> 01:05:58,132
Fuckin` degenerate.

1196
01:05:58,226 --> 01:06:01,013
Fuckin` kids at home.

1197
01:06:03,607 --> 01:06:06,525
Here. Get the fuck outta here.

1198
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:08,602
- Thanks, Nick.
- Yeah, thanks.

1199
01:06:08,695 --> 01:06:11,447
Let me find out you fucked up.
I`ll leave you where I find you.

1200
01:06:11,824 --> 01:06:13,733
How many of these
you gonna eat?

1201
01:06:13,784 --> 01:06:15,741
- Two.
- Two?

1202
01:06:15,786 --> 01:06:18,740
[ Ace ] But around 6:30 in the morning,
when he finished his day...

1203
01:06:18,789 --> 01:06:21,245
no matter where he was
or what he was doing...

1204
01:06:21,292 --> 01:06:24,376
he always went home to make breakfast
for his son, Nicky boy.

1205
01:06:24,461 --> 01:06:27,297
I know you like this.
A little butter, right?

1206
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:30,091
- Not a lot. You know why, right?
- Yeah.

1207
01:06:30,134 --> 01:06:33,088
- Why?
- `Cause it clogs up your heart.

1208
01:06:33,137 --> 01:06:37,300
What a smart kid you are.
Okay, eat.

1209
01:06:37,391 --> 01:06:40,143
[ Nicky ] Every couple of weeks,
I used to send Marino...

1210
01:06:40,228 --> 01:06:42,979
back to the bosses
with a piece of what I made.

1211
01:06:43,022 --> 01:06:45,347
Not a bit piece,
but what did they know?

1212
01:06:45,441 --> 01:06:48,645
They were 1,500 miles away, and I don`t
know anybody who can see that far.

1213
01:06:48,695 --> 01:06:50,770
Their drop was
a truck stop garage...

1214
01:06:50,821 --> 01:06:53,823
where Remo and the guys used
to hang out and count their millions.

1215
01:06:53,867 --> 01:06:55,824
- Remo.
- Hey, Frankie.

1216
01:06:55,869 --> 01:06:58,538
The cops knew,
but they didn`t give a fuck.

1217
01:06:58,621 --> 01:07:00,698
Nicky sends
his warmest regards.

1218
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:02,368
I knew how
to keep the bosses happy.

1219
01:07:02,417 --> 01:07:05,702
Whenever they gave me
little jobs to do...

1220
01:07:05,795 --> 01:07:09,129
I would carry things out
to a "T."

1221
01:07:09,174 --> 01:07:13,385
Like the time Tony Dogs,
who`s supposed to be
the new maniac tough guy in town...

1222
01:07:13,470 --> 01:07:15,878
shot up one of Remo`s bars.

1223
01:07:20,143 --> 01:07:23,347
Here`s a fuckin` guy
kills two of Remo`s guys...

1224
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:27,851
and a poor fuckin` waitress who was just
workin` on her night off, of all things.

1225
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:33,360
I mean, this guy`s just beggin`
to be made an example of.

1226
01:07:33,448 --> 01:07:37,114
Frankie, I want the names
of all the other people he had with him.

1227
01:07:37,203 --> 01:07:40,618
And I don`t care what you have
to do to `em to get `em, understand?

1228
01:07:40,706 --> 01:07:42,782
- I`ll take care of it, Remo.
- And mow `em down.

1229
01:07:42,875 --> 01:07:46,125
[ Nicky ] To be truthful with you,
I had to admire this guy.

1230
01:07:46,211 --> 01:07:49,047
He was one of the toughest
lrishmen I ever met.

1231
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:51,581
- [ Chattering ]
- This son of a bitch was tough.

1232
01:07:51,676 --> 01:07:55,127
For two days and two fuckin` nights
we beat the shit outta this guy.

1233
01:07:55,221 --> 01:07:57,546
We even stuck ice picks
in his balls.

1234
01:07:57,598 --> 01:08:01,382
- Better give me a name soon,
or I`m gonna give him yours, Frank.
- Thanks a lot.

1235
01:08:01,435 --> 01:08:04,556
- But he never talked.
- I know you would`ve ratted by now.

1236
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:07,268
In the end, I had to put
his fuckin` head in a vise.

1237
01:08:07,358 --> 01:08:10,110
Dogs, Dogs,
can you hear me, Dogs?

1238
01:08:10,194 --> 01:08:13,112
Listen to me, Anthony.
I got your head in a vise.

1239
01:08:13,198 --> 01:08:17,326
I`ll squash your fuckin` head like a
grapefruit if you don`t give me a name.

1240
01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:19,699
Don`t make me have to do this.
Please. Come on!

1241
01:08:19,746 --> 01:08:22,866
Don`t make me be a bad guy.
Come on.

1242
01:08:22,916 --> 01:08:25,407
[ Straining ]
Fuck you!

1243
01:08:25,502 --> 01:08:28,668
This motherfucker. You believe this?
Two fuckin` days and nights.

1244
01:08:28,755 --> 01:08:31,293
Fuck me? Fuck me?
You motherfucker!

1245
01:08:31,383 --> 01:08:34,218
Fuck my mother?
ls that what you`re tellin` me?

1246
01:08:34,261 --> 01:08:37,178
- [ Skull Crunching ]
- You motherfucker, you! Huh?

1247
01:08:37,264 --> 01:08:40,598
- Oh, God!
- Give me the fuckin` name!

1248
01:08:40,684 --> 01:08:42,593
[ Straining ]
Charlie M.

1249
01:08:42,686 --> 01:08:44,595
- Charlie M.?
- Charlie M.

1250
01:08:44,646 --> 01:08:47,601
You make me pop your
fuckin` eye outta your head...

1251
01:08:47,650 --> 01:08:50,603
to protect that piece of shit,
Charlie M.?

1252
01:08:50,652 --> 01:08:52,645
You dumb motherfucker!

1253
01:08:52,738 --> 01:08:54,861
Kill me, you fuck!
Kill me!

1254
01:08:54,949 --> 01:08:57,274
You motherfucker, you!

1255
01:08:57,367 --> 01:08:59,693
Frankie, do him
a fuckin` favor.

1256
01:08:59,787 --> 01:09:02,243
[ Ace ] The word got around
that finally...

1257
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:05,243
there was a real
gangster in town.

1258
01:09:05,292 --> 01:09:07,416
Nicky was the new boss
of Las Vegas.

1259
01:09:07,461 --> 01:09:09,419
Charlie M.

1260
01:09:11,465 --> 01:09:13,458
[ Bells Ringing ]

1261
01:09:13,551 --> 01:09:16,802
Four reels, sevens,
across three $15,000 jackpots.

1262
01:09:16,888 --> 01:09:19,295
Do you have any idea
what the odds are?

1263
01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:21,798
It`s gotta be
in the millions, maybe more.

1264
01:09:21,893 --> 01:09:25,178
Three fuckin` jackpots in 20 minutes!
Why didn`t you call me?

1265
01:09:25,271 --> 01:09:28,771
It happened so quick. Three guys won.
I didn`t have a chance.

1266
01:09:28,817 --> 01:09:32,565
- You didn`t see the scam?
- There`s no way to determine that.

1267
01:09:32,654 --> 01:09:34,860
Yes, there is.
They won!

1268
01:09:34,948 --> 01:09:38,032
It`s a casino.
People gotta win sometimes.

1269
01:09:38,117 --> 01:09:41,534
Ward, you`re pissing me off.
Now you`re insuIting my intelligence.

1270
01:09:41,621 --> 01:09:45,998
You know goddamn well somebody had
to get into those machines
and set those fuckin` reels.

1271
01:09:46,084 --> 01:09:49,002
The probability on one machine
is a million and a half to one.

1272
01:09:49,087 --> 01:09:51,661
On three machines in a row,
it`s in the billions.

1273
01:09:51,757 --> 01:09:53,832
What`s the matter with you?

1274
01:09:53,925 --> 01:09:58,802
Didn`t you see you were being set up
on the second win?

1275
01:09:58,848 --> 01:10:01,172
I think you`re overreacting.

1276
01:10:01,224 --> 01:10:04,511
Listen, you fuckin` yokel. I`ve been
carrying your ass ever since I got here.

1277
01:10:04,603 --> 01:10:08,019
- Get your ass outta here.
- You`re firing me?

1278
01:10:08,106 --> 01:10:10,562
I`m firing you.
No, I`m not firing--

1279
01:10:10,651 --> 01:10:13,984
- You might regret this.
- I`ll regret it if I keep you.

1280
01:10:14,029 --> 01:10:16,402
This is not the way
to treat people.

1281
01:10:16,490 --> 01:10:18,530
lf you didn`t know,
you`re too fuckin` dumb.

1282
01:10:18,618 --> 01:10:19,993
lf you did know,
you were in on it.

1283
01:10:20,036 --> 01:10:23,451
Either way, you`re out.
Get out. Come on. Let`s go.

1284
01:10:23,539 --> 01:10:26,576
The guy`s history
as far as I`m concerned.

1285
01:10:26,668 --> 01:10:30,167
But you can`t fire him. His
brother-in-law is County Commissioner.

1286
01:10:30,213 --> 01:10:35,420
Everybody with cowboy boots is
a fuckin` county commissioner
or related to a commissioner.

1287
01:10:35,509 --> 01:10:37,752
This is his state.
His uncle`s chief judge.

1288
01:10:37,845 --> 01:10:40,253
His brother-in-law runs
the county commission.

1289
01:10:40,348 --> 01:10:43,265
You`re in the finances,
you`re upstairs.

1290
01:10:43,351 --> 01:10:46,186
But you are not on the floor.
You don`t see what`s going on.

1291
01:10:46,229 --> 01:10:49,099
I`ve got thousands of players.
I`ve got 500 dealers.

1292
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:51,860

01:28:47,098 --> 01:28:49,849
lt turned out Phil Green,
Mr. lntegrity...

1610
01:28:49,934 --> 01:28:52,010
had a partner
nobody knew about.

1611
01:28:52,103 --> 01:28:55,305
And when she showed up
and started demanding money--

1612
01:28:55,397 --> 01:28:58,647
- Why are you doing this?
- Because you`re wrong.

1613
01:28:58,692 --> 01:29:00,768
- Yes, you are.
- No, l am not wrong.

1614
01:29:00,819 --> 01:29:03,025
Green tried to stonewall her.

1615
01:29:03,112 --> 01:29:05,947
l will see to it that you
do not get away with this.

1616
01:29:05,990 --> 01:29:08,030
So, she sued him in court.

1617
01:29:08,117 --> 01:29:11,486
The court will now hear the matter
of the plaintiff, Anna Scott...

1618
01:29:11,537 --> 01:29:14,538
against Tangiers Corporation
and its president, Phil Green.

1619
01:29:14,623 --> 01:29:18,122
- Oberon on behalf of Mr. Green.
- Logan on behalf of Anna Scott.

1620
01:29:18,168 --> 01:29:20,540
- Mr. Oberon, you can proceed.
- Thank you, Judge.

1621
01:29:20,629 --> 01:29:23,664
l believe he was fair,
and l`m delighted with the decision.

1622
01:29:23,714 --> 01:29:25,707
We got a problem.

1623
01:29:29,136 --> 01:29:31,971
lt didn`t go too well.
Green has to open up the books...

1624
01:29:32,013 --> 01:29:34,386
has to show how
he got the financing.

1625
01:29:34,474 --> 01:29:36,384
Hey, that`s not good.

1626
01:29:39,312 --> 01:29:42,396
[ Nicky ] She was doin` pretty good
with her lawsuit.

1627
01:29:42,482 --> 01:29:44,853
But before she could start
countin` her money...

1628
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:47,652
the boys back home decided
to settle the case out of court.

1629
01:29:47,694 --> 01:29:49,853
So they sent me.

1630
01:30:04,919 --> 01:30:07,872
Can you comment on
the murder of Anna Scott?

1631
01:30:07,921 --> 01:30:11,539
- What are you talking about?
- She was found
last night shot in the head.

1632
01:30:11,591 --> 01:30:13,714
Was this just
a real estate partnership?

1633
01:30:13,759 --> 01:30:15,882
Her lawyer said
you were partners.

1634
01:30:15,928 --> 01:30:19,712
We were involved in minor
real estate deals many years ago.

1635
01:30:19,806 --> 01:30:22,380
lt was never a partnership.

1636
01:30:22,476 --> 01:30:25,393
Did you ever hear
of the .22 Caliber Killer?

1637
01:30:25,437 --> 01:30:28,390
[ Ace ] Now, instead of the cops
only looking at Nicky...

1638
01:30:28,439 --> 01:30:30,728
they started looking
at Green too.

1639
01:30:30,775 --> 01:30:33,561
And he was supposed to be
our squeaky-clean front man.

1640
01:30:33,610 --> 01:30:36,528
l had to start giving interviews
to make sure everybody knew...

1641
01:30:36,572 --> 01:30:38,897
the casino
was on the up-and-up.

1642
01:30:38,949 --> 01:30:41,522
So how often do you
really fill in for him?

1643
01:30:43,578 --> 01:30:46,414
Green`s here about
two or three times a month...

1644
01:30:46,456 --> 01:30:48,993
and he`s busy
with real estate deals.

1645
01:30:49,083 --> 01:30:52,084
So in Green`s absence,
then, you`re the boss?

1646
01:30:52,170 --> 01:30:55,253
l serve at the pleasure
of the chairman of the board.

1647
01:30:55,339 --> 01:31:00,760
My responsibilities are
to run the day-to-day operations.

1648
01:31:00,803 --> 01:31:03,008
So day-to-day, then,
you`re the boss?

1649
01:31:03,096 --> 01:31:06,761
Well, in a sense, you could say
that l am the boss...

1650
01:31:06,808 --> 01:31:09,594
when Mr. Green is away.

1651
01:31:11,312 --> 01:31:13,351
You could say that.

1652
01:31:13,939 --> 01:31:15,433

Did he really say that?

1658
01:31:29,911 --> 01:31:33,115
Why, of course he said that.
lt`s right here.

1659
01:31:33,165 --> 01:31:37,162
Has that man even filed
for his license yet?

1660
01:31:37,251 --> 01:31:39,921
l don`t know.
We have to check the files.

1661
01:31:39,963 --> 01:31:42,454
Without gettin` your shorts
in a knot, would you do that?

1662
01:31:42,507 --> 01:31:46,586
And kinda check closely, `cause we may
have to kick a kike`s ass outta town.

02:54:45,339 --> 02:54:49,799
÷ The melody
haunts my memory ÷

2971
02:54:53,346 --> 02:54:56,928
÷ And l am once again with you ÷

2972
02:55:00,061 --> 02:55:03,642
÷ When our love was new ÷

2973
02:55:03,730 --> 02:55:07,562
÷ And each kiss an inspiration ÷

2974
02:55:09,486 --> 02:55:13,435
÷ Ah, but that was long ago ÷

2975
02:55:13,531 --> 02:55:16,069
÷ And now my consolation ÷

2976
02:55:16,117 --> 02:55:19,070
÷ ls in the stardust of a song ÷

2977
02:55:22,748 --> 02:55:25,285
÷ Beside a garden wall ÷

2978
02:55:25,375 --> 02:55:27,866
÷ When stars were bright ÷

2979
02:55:27,961 --> 02:55:29,953
÷ And you were in my arms ÷

2980
02:55:32,464 --> 02:55:36,130
÷ The nightingale
told his fairy tale ÷

2981
02:55:40,639 --> 02:55:42,964
÷ Of paradise ÷

2982
02:55:43,016 --> 02:55:45,969
÷ Where roses grew ÷

2983
02:55:49,772 --> 02:55:52,309
÷ Though l dream in vain ÷

2984
02:55:56,069 --> 02:55:58,607
÷ ln my heart ÷

2985
02:55:58,655 --> 02:56:00,943
÷ lt will remain ÷

2986
02:56:02,825 --> 02:56:06,158
÷ My stardust melody ÷

2987
02:56:06,203 --> 02:56:09,204
÷ The memory ÷

2988
02:56:09,290 --> 02:56:12,954
÷ Of love`s refrain ÷÷
