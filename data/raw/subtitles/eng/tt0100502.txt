1
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,071
MagnaVolt. The final word
in auto security.

2
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,830
No embarrassing alarm noise,
no need to trouble the police...

3
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,438
...and it won't even run down your battery.

4
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,311
On the international scene,
the Amazon nuclear-power facility...

5
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,671
...has blown its stack, irradiating
the world's largest rainforest.

6
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,873
- Environmentalists call it a disaster.
- But don't they always?

7
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,393
In national news, the Attorney General
today approved the ED-209 combat unit...

8
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,750
...for deployment in five American cities...

9
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,917
...despite widespread
complaints of malfunction.

10
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,679
The Surgeon General was
gunned down 20 minutes ago...

11
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,633
...by a militant addict of
the deadly designer drug, Nuke.

12
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,150
The greatest health threat
facing our nation.

13
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,430
Nuke. The most addictive
narcotic in history.

14
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,516
A plague that...

15
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,155
(man) Get some help!

16
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,236
(assassin) Nuke! Nuke!

17
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,837
This station has just received
this transmission from Cain...

18
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,032
...convicted murderer
and leader of the Nuke cult.

19
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,116
People want paradise.

20
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,753
And they will have it.

21
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,872
The assassination is the latest
act of terrorism by Cain...

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,630
...following the firebombing of a drug
treatment clinic that left five dead.

23
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,910
Following a breakdown in negotiations...

24
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,751
...Detroit's police returned to the picket
line, demanding better terms from OCP...

25
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,793
...the corporation contracted by the city
to run the Detroit Police Department.

26
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,039
OCP cut our salaries 40 percent
and cancelled our pensions...

27
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,833
...and now they refuse to even talk to us.

28
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,155
God knows why, but they want this strike.

29
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,476
(old woman mutters)

30
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,516
- (woman wails)
- What happened?

31
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,876
(woman sobs)

32
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,351
Hm.

33
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,199
Ooh, look what he got. Yeah.

34
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,276
(chuckles)

35
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,593
Agh!

36
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,076
Get up.

37
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,350
- Hold him.
- Oh, you put my eye out, you bitches.

38
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,436
Shut up, you fuckhead!

39
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,555
You're breakin' my fuckin' arm!

40
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,310
Look at this. What a nasty man.

41
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,275
Night's made. Let's pay papa
and get us what we need.

42
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,356
Nuke me, baby.

43
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,349
- (mugger) I'll kill you bitches!
- He's up. Come on!

44
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,078
(screaming)

45
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,476
- You're shit with a timer, man.
- Come on! Let's go!

46
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,434
I'll take out an army with this shit.

47
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,912
Let's load up and get the hell outta here.

48
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,679
Where's the bullets
for this gun, man? Huh?

49
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,155
Third drawer, bottom.

50
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,636
Wow!

51
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,555
We should have brought a truck.

52
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,629
(laughs)

53
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,152
- I really like this gun, man.
- Then just take it and get out.

54
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,396
Thanks.

55
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,559
(police sirens)

56
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,796
- I don't believe this!
- What?

57
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,480
- It's the cops, man.
- Cops are on strike, stupid.

58
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,556
Can't you hear that?

59
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,916
(police sirens)

60
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,439
- See? What'd I tell ya?
- I'll fix him.

61
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,269
(robber laughs)

62
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,636
Did you see that? We got him!

63
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,991
- Beautiful. Come on, man, let's move.
- No, one more!

64
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,116
Nice shit, man.

65
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,872
Fucking cops!

66
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,072
(laughs)

67
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,836
Peace officer.

68
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,196
Think it over, creep.

69
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,916
Nuke.

70
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,155
It's not mine, man.

71
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,033
Where is it made?

72
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,628
It's not mine, man, I told you. I'm clean.

73
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,716
Ow!

74
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,914
Where is it made?

75
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,153
I don't know. All I know is where I get it.

76
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,636
(MUSIC salsa)

77
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,716
(muffled voices)

78
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,388
(baby cries)

79
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,877
(music stops)

80
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,877
Freeze. Nobody move. This is a bust.

81
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,271
(women scream)

82
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,755
Ladies, stay down.

83
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,280
(speaks Chinese)

84
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,476
(police siren)

85
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,880
(man) Somebody!
Open the fridge, damn it!

86
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,398
Can't shoot a kid, can you, fucker?

87
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,990
(distorted) Can't shoot a kid, can you?

88
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,077
Throw it home, Dad!

89
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,798
- (baby cries)
- (woman shouts in Chinese)

90
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,636
Shut up!

91
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,355
Drop it or she's dead!
I'll blow its fucking head off, man!

92
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,914
Lewis, hang it up.

93
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,031
Now, no shit from either one of you.

94
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,072
And don't try to follow me.
The baby's goin' with me!

95
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,475
- No.
- I'll kill it, man. I'll do it.

96
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,149
- I'll fuckin' kill it!
- We can't have that.

97
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,556
Nice shootin'.

98
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,316
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

99
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,795
Don't do... No, stop. Stop it.

100
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,992
(man) OCP defines you as a machine...

101
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,434
...that utilises some living tissue.

102
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,516
You understand that?

103
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,074
Yes.

104
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,909
And so, do you consider yourself human?

105
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,675
I require an answer.

106
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,396
Stop tape.

107
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,833
Do you have any idea what
you're doing to that poor woman?

108
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,918
Take a look at her file. Go on.

109
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,431
(lawyer) Officer, Mrs Murphy
is bringing suit against OCP.

110
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,949
My name is Tom Delaney.
I'm representing her.

111
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,390
Up to a few months ago,
she wouldn't leave her bedroom.

112
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,239
Then there were the therapists
and the hypnotists...

113
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,148
And then you pull this shit.
Drivin' past her house, day after day.

114
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,795
Spyin'on her. Tryin' to make her
think her husband is still alive.

115
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,118
She's barely started to accept the loss.
You're ripping her to pieces.

116
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,549
And for what?

117
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,229
Do you think you could
ever be a husband to her?

118
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,794
I mean, what can you offer her?

119
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,111
Companionship?

120
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,236
Love?

121
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,316
A man's love?

122
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,191
No.

123
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,316
Roll tape.

124
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,194
Are you Alex Murphy?

125
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,999
No.

126
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,509
Are you human?

127
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,312
No.

128
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,676
You are simply a machine.

129
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,875
I am... a machine.

130
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,550
Nothing more.

131
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,671
Nothing more.

132
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,833
That'll do it. Stop tape.

133
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,552
You stay there. All right, go get her.

134
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,717
Let's be decent about this.
Give them some privacy.

135
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,750
I don't have a problem with that.

136
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,556
Alex?

137
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,636
Don't you know me?

138
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,315
Don't you remember me?

139
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,670
Alex, it doesn't matter
what they've done to you.

140
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,631
Touch me.

141
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,788
- It's cold.
- They made this to honour him.

142
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,273
- No...
- Your husband is dead.

143
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,714
I don't know you.

144
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,515
Why is this happening?

145
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,117
I thought all communication
systems were the same.

146
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,279
I tried to save the company a few bucks.

147
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,270
It took two days to download
specs from Cleveland.

148
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,516
I lost the account.

149
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,637
It hardly befits the dignity of my office
to have to come to you.

150
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,149
My apologies for
the slight inconvenience.

151
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,558
20 minutes in rush-hour traffic isn't slight.
Not when you're the mayor of a city.

152
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,275
When are you gonna start paying
the cops so they'll go back to work?

153
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,552
We're not a charity. The city
owes us over 37 million dollars.

154
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,877
- You'll have to cut us some slack.
- A deadline's a deadline.

155
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,434
How are we supposed to
raise that kind of money?

156
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,755
You aren't.

157
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,395
- What the hell is he talkin' about?
- We don't expect you to pay.

158
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,476
Let me refer you to our contract.

159
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:38,389
'In the event of default, OCP shall have
the right of foreclosure on all city assets.'

160
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,078
- You signed this.
- So you're saying you can foreclose?

161
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,478
We can and we will.
We're taking Detroit private.

162
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,268
So you deliberately
undermined our credit.

163
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,356
That was the easy part.

164
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,831
And you engineered the police strike.
You want Detroit to tear itself apart...

165
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,713
...so you can raid it like you would
any other corporation?

166
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,196
Do you know how many people
are dying out there? You're murderers.

167
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,472
I'd advise you to say nothing further.
It might be... actionable.

168
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,593
It's bullshit! Bullshit,
you senile old bastard!

169
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,870
- It's bullshit!
- We better get outta here.

170
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,037
- I'm OK.
- Calm down. I think we'd better leave.

171
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,116
- Calm down. Easy, easy.
- I'm OK.

172
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,915
- Right. Good.
- I'm in control. Everything is fine. It's OK.

173
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,639
I'm fine.

174
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,796
One last thing, gentlemen.

175
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,356
- We will sue your asses.
- Give it your best shot.

176
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,835
Fuck you, you old senile bastard!

177
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,996
This is bullshit! Fuck you!

178
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,355
It's bullshit! Damn bullshit!

179
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,432
I've been very patient, Johnson.
Five months.

180
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,400
- Who's that?
- Dr Juliette Faxx, just been moved up...

181
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:59,117
...to head the Attitude Adjustment Team.
- Five months. 19 million dollars.

182
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,790
- I want to see some results.
- Yes, sir. I'll show you what we have.

183
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,873
OCP pioneered cyborg technology,
and now we take a quantum leap forward.

184
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,959
State-of-the-art destructive capabilities
commanded by a combination...

185
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,038
...of software and organic systems.

186
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,720
In every way, an improvement
over the original.

187
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,913
It gives me great pleasure
to introduce to you RoboCop 2.

188
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,634
(trumpets)

189
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,955
You are under arrest.

190
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,915
Stop or I'll shoot.

191
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,756
Stop or...

192
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,351
OCP is proud to present the future
of urban pacification. RoboCop 2.

193
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,436
(trumpets)

194
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,593
Aaaagh!

195
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,995
(crash)

196
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,276
19 million.

197
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,798
- They all go crazy.
- Robots with emotional problems.

198
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,833
No, sir, no, sir. Not robots - cyborgs.
Cybernetic organisms.

199
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,918
We use living, human tissue
and that's our whole problem.

200
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,636
The candidates were all respected police
officers. I reviewed their files myself.

201
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,231
Sir, police officers may not be
the best candidates for our purposes.

202
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,555
They're physical, macho, body-proud.

203
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,514
Finding themselves stripped of all that,
it's no wonder they become suicidal.

204
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,676
Our one success was a cop.

205
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,237
Well, yes, Mr Johnson - Alex Murphy.
Top of his class, devout Irish Catholic...

206
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,399
...family man, everything in his profile
indicates a fierce sense of duty.

207
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,830
- That's probably what kept him alive.
- With all due respect...

208
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,236
...your area of expertise
is psychology, not robotics.

209
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,750
There's no harm in hearing
the young lady out, is there, Johnson?

210
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,110
- No, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

211
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,552
I believe Murphy's case was unusual, but
not unique. We can find someone else.

212
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,878
Someone to whom the prospect
might even be... desirable.

213
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,274
I've never met anyone
who wanted to be a robot.

214
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,995
It would require a screening process,
one I'd be happy to supervise.

215
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,317
The cost would be negligible and...

216
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,238
...it'd be a shame to waste
all the work that's been done.

217
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,316
It certainly would, my dear.

218
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,000
Go to it. Report to me directly.

219
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,111
Yes, sir.

220
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,316
You could learn a thing or two
from that girl, Johnson.

221
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,996
(demonstrators chanting)

222
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,916
Hey!

223
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,915
The union's got a list.
We ain't forgettin' who you are!

224
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,996
One at a time.

225
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,036
One at a time.

226
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,389
- It's the best we can do.
- Hello, ladies.

227
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,438
Ah, ah, ah.

228
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,712
I took out three of 'em, Leon. They
won't be fuckin' with any more cops.

229
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,638
They won't be fuckin' with nobody, man.

230
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,876
(coughs)

231
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,556
Oh...

232
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,116
Yeah.

233
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,828
(RoboCop) Hob. That's him.

234
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,751
Nuke me.

235
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,791
There's plenty of Nuke to go around.

236
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,670
I've lost him.

237
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,475
(RoboCop) Five degrees south-southwest.

238
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,117
There's the little darling.
Good eyes, Murphy.

239
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,435
Good as money can buy.

240
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,710
Ferdy, you got out.

241
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,229
Well, I'll tell Cain, OK?

242
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,996
Better have something
to give me this time, Officer.

243
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,751
One cop per car. OK, these are the routes.

244
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,671
Three cars.

245
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,472
- One cop per car?
- That's right.

246
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,957
Sittin' ducks. We set up three
snipers and that's all it takes.

247
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,754
- Pay the man.
- All right.

248
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,269
- Thank you.
- Hey, you didn't count it.

249
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,278
- That's all right.
- You should really count it, you know.

250
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,958
It's OK.

251
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,390
Give him somethin' to
help him with his conscience.

252
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,193
Ah, no, that's all right.
I don't really want it.

253
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,595
Come on, Duffy. I know you need it.

254
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,955
(MUSIC hard rock)

255
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,156
Isn't this a school day?

256
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,151
(man) Cops!

257
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,350
(whispers) Hey!

258
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,436
Shit.

259
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,470
Oh, no.

260
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,351
Freeze.

261
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,835
Turn around. Put your hands up.

262
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,276
(screaming)

263
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,276
Shit.

264
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,280
Officer Duffy, have a seat.

265
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,437
You look a little outta breath, bitch.

266
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,672
You sold us out, Officer Duffy.

267
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,554
- What are you talkin' about, Murph?
- Where is Cain?

268
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,476
I don't know any Cain.

269
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,992
- No!
- Where is Cain?

270
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,076
I don't know.

271
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,548
Where is Cain?

272
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,955
I told ya, I don't know!

273
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,391
Where?

274
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,034
River Rouge - the old sludge plant.

275
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,470
You're a rotten cop.

276
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,716
Go.

277
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,639
- (RoboCop) You.
- You want me?

278
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,716
(RoboCop) Dead or alive.

279
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,998
- Then one of us must die.
- Dead, then.

280
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,990
Jesus had days like this.

281
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,398
Hounded and attacked, like a criminal.

282
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,478
But, like him, I don't blame you.

283
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,068
They programme you and you do it.

284
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,598
I will kill you.

285
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,676
You just tried.

286
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,393
And... I forgive you.

287
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,555
Argh!

288
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,237
- Why'd you stop? You got it cracked.
- I'm tired.

289
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,155
They say he's got a brain. I wanna see it.

290
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,234
You think it was me that beat you?

291
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,035
It wasn't. It was this.

292
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,396
(drilling)

293
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,676
It's too tough.

294
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,756
Try here, at the joint.

295
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,437
Yeah.

296
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,396
Ha! Look at that!

297
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,557
Hey! Come on, cut it out.

298
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,154
- How's it taste?
- Argh!

299
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,595
What the hell's goin' on?

300
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,676
Man, just look at him.

301
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,518
Christ, he's been stripped.

302
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,996
Let's get him inside.

303
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,470
Let's not get carried away. We're
talking about a piece of equipment.

304
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,229
Don't tell me he can't suffer.
Just look at him.

305
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,676
It's... it's electrical.

306
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,756
Bullshit.

307
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,670
I know every inch of him,
every circuit, every living nerve.

308
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,554
His pain centres are alive.
They're lit up like Christmas trees.

309
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,558
The backup generator's
just makin' him twitch.

310
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,070
He's suffering. How long can he last?

311
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,034
No way of knowing.
Got him on minimal life support.

312
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,512
Keeping the brain
going with microshocks.

313
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,270
It's damn tricky. Could be goin' any time.

314
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,356
Move, move!

315
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,792
- What's happening in here?
- OCP is happening.

316
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,593
These bastards won't
lift a finger to help him.

317
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,598
This unit needs millions
of dollars in parts.

318
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,754
You can't expect authorisation
for that overnight. Be reasonable.

319
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,670
- If you don't fix him, it's murder.
- I'm doin' you a favour just talkin' to you.

320
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,756
You son of a bitch.

321
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,836
He's in hell.

322
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,796
I'll be in touch.

323
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,919
(Duffy) Oh, man. You guys are
the greatest. Did you see their faces?

324
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,069
'We're gonna throw away the key, Duffy.'

325
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,590
The cops didn't give you
too much trouble?

326
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:40,999
Usual shit from Reed. They'll never
prove anything. Hey, want some?

327
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,430
Hey, I'm a minor.
Don't wanna break any laws.

328
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,790
Here, you take it.
God, I just love you guys!

329
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,791
What happened?

330
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,876
Where we goin'?

331
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,833
Hey, come on, guys.
This isn't funny, man.

332
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,030
Oh, God, my head.

333
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,549
My head's so killin' me.

334
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,237
Wait a minute. Hey, Cain.

335
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,430
Hey, it's... it's good to see ya.

336
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,915
Thanks for gettin' me out.

337
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,995
- I can't get up.
- We noticed that one.

338
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,791
- I don't know what that kid told you...
- You told them where we were.

339
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,310
- That's not true.
- (Hob) We know all about it, Duffy.

340
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,557
You think you're the only cop we have?

341
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:35,438
Holy shit! Cain, Cain...
I'm begging you, man.

342
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,154
Look, I'll do anything.

343
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,432
OK. You're kiddin', right? Yeah,
you're just kiddin'. Oh, you scared me.

344
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,994
Oh, you taught me a lesson, man.

345
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,193
I'd never fuck with you, because
I really love you guys. I really do.

346
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,880
- Shut up.
- Look, I've been loyal.

347
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,436
I know shit that I still
haven't even told you, Cain.

348
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,918
You deserve this, Duffy.
Cain might have been killed.

349
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,237
- OK, OK.
- Maybe you oughta have the kid leave?

350
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,912
- Why?
- What? We oughta have the kid leave?

351
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,999
That's a good touch. That's a good touch.
Have the kid leave.

352
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,598
'Have the kid leave.' 'Why?'

353
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,634
Come on, please. It's over.

354
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,475
Come on, Cain. Come on,
man, what are you doin'?

355
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,636
No! No, come on.

356
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,990
Agh!

357
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,588
(screaming)

358
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,073
You said you were just gonna scare him!

359
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,555
Doesn't he look scared?

360
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,476
(screaming)

361
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:01,229
- I can't believe you're contemplating this.
- It hardly matters what you believe.

362
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,033
But these are criminals. Maniacs.

363
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,357
You're given to premature
value judgements.

364
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,676
All right, it may be true.
The subjects are socially misaligned.

365
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,917
Socially misaligned?
These are death-row inmates.

366
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,271
And of no use to society. We need
a subject who'll welcome the power...

367
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,356
...the virtual immortality we offer.

368
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,029
Now, I really think this is
a good place to start looking.

369
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,516
You're out of your mind.

370
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,029
Is that your professional opinion?

371
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,469
Yes, goddamnit, it is, yes.

372
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,991
And you are not using my lab to put
that kind of a brain into my cyborg.

373
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,475
We'd dearly miss you here.

374
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,873
You're the one that's
gonna be out of a job.

375
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,833
I'm gonna take this directly to Johnson.

376
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,430
He's just been waiting for
an excuse to get you fired.

377
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,515
Good morning, sir.

378
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,108
I'm sorry to bother you this early.

379
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,676
- You seem agitated.
- Well, frankly, I'm shocked.

380
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:14,713
Mr Schenk just called. Dr Faxx has begun
screening candidates for RoboCop 2.

381
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,956
So I understand.

382
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:21,278
- It's very exciting.
- She's screening psychotics. Murderers.

383
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,278
Well, we aren't planning
to build a toy, Johnson.

384
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,995
- Faxx knows what she's doing.
- She's keeping RoboCop off line.

385
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,076
It's a public relations disaster.

386
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,590
You've got to learn to look at
the larger picture, the foreclosure.

387
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,870
You must know how
important that is to us.

388
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,595
With RoboCop out of commission,
the chaos down there will increase.

389
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,188
So will the odds that the city
will fall into our hands.

390
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,471
Yes, but a competent executive
would find a way to deal with...

391
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,559
...the corporate image problem.
- Couldn't agree with you more.

392
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,596
Fortunately, I have found a way.

393
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,030
Yes, Miss Faxx and I
have already discussed it.

394
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:00,994
I know you'll help to implement her ideas.

395
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,157
- Of course, sir, whatever I can do.
- Anything else?

396
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,080
- Coffee?
- No, thank you.

397
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,194
Don't forget your shoes on the way out.

398
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,916
(grunts)

399
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,999
- He's my patient. I have to stay with him.
- We'll let you know when we need you.

400
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,237
Nobody on your staff has
my experience with him. You need me.

401
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,874
- We don't need anybody.
- 'We'? Who the hell are 'we'?

402
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,116
You're a lawyer!
You know nothing about him!

403
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,437
You're exactly this far
from gettin' fired, babe.

404
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,915
Shyster!

405
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:04,074
He's one of mine.
I want him back on his feet.

406
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,356
Well, maybe he will be, or maybe
we'll just sell the parts for scrap.

407
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,439
That's up to us. You see,
RoboCop's off warranty.

408
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:21,074
RoboCop's command programme,
his set of directives...

409
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,634
...it determines his behaviour.

410
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,274
It's time to update the programme and...

411
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,551
...well, I would like to hear
from each one of you.

412
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,156
(whispers) It's about time they asked us.

413
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,238
Well, we're getting a lot of heat
from the parents' groups.

414
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,033
Personally, I don't blame them -
I'm a parent myself.

415
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,870
All that destructive behaviour - he's
become a role model for our children.

416
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,514
- Now, what are we teaching them?
- You have a point.

417
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:49,428
If he'd just talk things out with people,
instead of firing that big gun of his.

418
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,632
Couldn't he take time
to address environmental issues?

419
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,275
- Excuse me, what was that?
- He could speak out on the environment.

420
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,472
- Don't see any reason why not.
- For all the shooting he does...

421
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:03,434
...I've never once seen him
take the time to do anything nice...

422
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,676
...like visit an orphanage.

423
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,236
(Johnson) You're absolutely right.
Or help a cat out of a tree...

424
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,715
...or go collecting for the Red Cross...

425
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:16,356
...or maybe even roasting some
marshmallows with some Cub Scouts(!)

426
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,553
Why, Mr Johnson, that is wonderful.

427
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,916
Thank you so much(!)

428
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,274
- The programme isn't uploading.
- He's resisting.

429
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:33,188
- There's too much data.
- No, it's him. Leave him to me.

430
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,276
It's not going to work!

431
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,433
You're wasting valuable time.
Don't resist us.

432
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:43,439
Let me up. I must go.

433
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,395
Go where? Hm?

434
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,593
Do what? Go dancing? Fall in love?
What is it you think you are?

435
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,316
Alex Murphy.

436
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,552
That's a delusion.
It's a glitch in your system.

437
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:02,719
Alex Murphy is dead. You take away
the plastic and metal and wires...

438
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:07,789
...and you're just a couple of chunks on a
coroner's table. You're not even a corpse.

439
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,076
What are you?

440
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,796
Respond.

441
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:20,274
I am Officer Alex Murphy,
Detroit Police Department.

442
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,356
That won't do.

443
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,716
What are you?

444
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,388
RoboCop, Crime Prevention Unit.

445
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,438
OCP.

446
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,994
Better, much better.

447
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:49,275
- I type it, you think it.
- You type it, I think it.

448
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,917
What a wonderful
opportunity you represent.

449
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:58,194
Psychotherapy, it's such a...
it's a slow, clumsy practice...

450
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:01,676
...but with you, this is so simple, direct.

451
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,913
You're very lucky.
We can do in moments with you...

452
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,430
...what would take years
with a human patient.

453
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,790
I'm really very lucky.

454
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:23,040
You're free. You're free from doubt,
free from having to make painful choices.

455
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,917
I am free.

456
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,716
He's ready.

457
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,915
Uploading command programme.

458
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,956
I am so glad we had
this chance to dialogue.

459
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:51,194
Look at you, it's like you're brand new.

460
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,790
- Thank you, thank you.
- You really had us worried there, Murphy.

461
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,912
- I'm touched.
- Get this guy.

462
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,429
He's touched.

463
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:05,838
That's enough. All of you,
back to your posts. Come on. Let's go.

464
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,797
- How you feeling, Murphy?
- I'm just fine, Warren.

465
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,229
Thank you for asking.

466
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:19,593
Let's get you downstairs. I wanna see
what those amateurs at OCP screwed up.

467
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,871
Pity. It's a beautiful morning.

468
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,635
Shame to waste it.

469
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,950
- Ready for duty, partner?
- You betcha.

470
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,719
- Let's go.
- Nothing I'd rather do.

471
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,552
- He sounds terrific.
- Something's wrong.

472
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,396
(breaking glass)

473
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,190
Harder!

474
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,352
(police siren)

475
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,278
It's Robo! Everybody out the back door!

476
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,711
- It's locked!
- It won't open!

477
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,071
Murph, wake up, will ya?

478
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,596
Good morning.

479
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,675
(Lewis) Come on, take him out.

480
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,956
Murph.

481
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,794
I think we should talk.

482
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,030
What's with you, Murph?

483
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,355
- Where'd they go?
- Where'd they go?

484
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,270
They're still here. The little bastards.

485
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,793
Hands up. Let's go. Everybody up.

486
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,474
Move it. Up against the wall.

487
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,556
Let's go.

488
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,553
Hands on top of your heads.
Nobody move.

489
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:36,756
You are under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

490
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,237
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

491
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,715
- He's dead.
- You have the right to an attorney.

492
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,149
You're reading Miranda to a corpse.

493
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,800
I'm having trouble.

494
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,672
Oh, my!

495
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,796
This isn't very nice.

496
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,317
Though you may think
you are having fun now...

497
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,671
...you only hurt the one you love.

498
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:21,271
Think of Mom and Dad. What kind
of lesson are you teaching them?

499
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,517
And now a word on nutrition.

500
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,596
Shit! He's fucked up.

501
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,231
Bad language makes for bad feelings.

502
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:35,434
- Let's go.
- The point is, we all have to work.

503
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,192
I haven't finished.

504
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,836
Hit the gas, Murphy.

505
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,872
The posted limit is 35.

506
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,309
We should set an example, Anne.

507
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,758
Your hair looks lovely that way.

508
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,633
It's OCP. They did something to you.

509
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,836
I'm fine.

510
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,715
Isn't the moon wonderful tonight?

511
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:08,193
- It's still daytime.
- It's the thought that counts.

512
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,234
Oh, Jesus, we're heading back
to the station, that's all there is to it.

513
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,790
What the hell are you doing?

514
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,990
Waste makes haste...

515
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:34,032
...for time is fleeting.

516
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,949
A rolling stone is worth two in the bush.

517
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,275
Go fuck a refrigerator, pecker neck!

518
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:46,073
Bad language makes for bad feelings.

519
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,156
You're nuts!

520
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,759
(laughter)

521
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,115
Murphy, come on, let's go.

522
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,476
Come on.

523
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,636
Back!

524
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,670
Thank you for not smoking.

525
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,915
Well, there it is. It's OCP.

526
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:31,235
- They screwed him up.
- He must be goin' out of his mind.

527
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:34,189
It's not as if he can just say no.

528
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:37,437
They've put all this
nonsense into his brain.

529
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:41,155
- He has to obey.
- Take them out, all of them.

530
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,748
Can't be done, not with this equipment.

531
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,952
Are you saying there's no way?
I can't believe that.

532
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:50,152
Well, sure, there are ways.
You can pull his cranial circuits.

533
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,748
Which would shut down
his life-support system.

534
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,350
Could run a few thousand volts
through him, pray his insulation holds.

535
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,436
Probably kill him.

536
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,990
- Let go!
- I'll get some help.

537
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,077
- Get him inside.
- Come on, move it!

538
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,953
Don't touch him, he's hot!
Use your jackets.

539
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,514
- Why did he do that?
- OCP gave him crazy commands.

540
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,596
Fried himself to get rid of them.

541
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,188
He weighs a ton.

542
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,276
He sure does.

543
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,476
- Get out of the way.
- Move out!

544
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,715
- Think he's alive?
- I don't know.

545
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,796
Put me down.

546
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,436
Are we cops?

547
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:56,233
- What's buggin' you, Murph?
- Cain.

548
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,272
Cain's bugging me.

549
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,399
(Cain) We have only just begun, my flock.

550
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,557
Soon, we will expand from city to city.

551
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:10,708
The rich and the poor alike will know
a paradise for every moment of their lives.

552
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:16,117
There's a Nuke for every mood. We'll
offer our customers the opportunity...

553
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,710
...to control every aspect
of their emotional lives.

554
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:24,595
With the white noise and the black
thunder, the red ramrod and the...

555
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:28,713
...the blue velvet. Frank, the blue velvet?

556
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,796
I think it's ready, sir.

557
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,556
Thank you, Frank.

558
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:51,549
Frank, the Benzedrine's
got my teeth wiggling.

559
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,308
Cut it with scopolamine.

560
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,635
- Five mils per.
- Yes, sir.

561
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,031
Made in America.

562
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:05,675
Yeah, we're gonna make that
mean something again.

563
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:12,313
Hey, cops! Cops!

564
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,114
And they ain't carryin' no picket signs.

565
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,230
They going to kick somebody's ass.

566
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,116
(gunfire)

567
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,156
(gunfire)

568
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:37,674
Give me your hand, goddamnit!

569
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,916
Christ.

570
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,391
Fuck! Bomb! Get out!

571
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,032
Bomb! Get down!

572
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,796
500 million in cash.
Nuke money, seized by police.

573
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:48,993
But the state attorney won't let
the bankrupt city government touch it.

574
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:53,239
Coming up next: Threats from the police
union and cheers from the public...

575
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:57,558
...as Metro North cops go back to work
and apprehend the Nuke lord, Cain...

576
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,830
...who may not live to stand trial.

577
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:09,955
They say 20 seconds in the California
sunshine is too much these days...

578
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:13,114
...ever since we lost the ozone layer.

579
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:17,791
But that was before Sun Block 5000.

580
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:22,831
Just apply a pint to your body...

581
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,275
...and you're good for hours.

582
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:30,475
See you by the pool.

583
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,229
Sun Block 5000.

584
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:41,920
Protection for the New Age.

585
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:48,394
Subject is violently antisocial,
given to delusions of godhood...

586
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:52,630
...and is hopelessly
addicted to narcotics...

587
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:59,073
...which offers us a simple and infallible
method of ensuring his obedience.

588
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,796
Hm.

589
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:10,671
You're perfect. I must have you.

590
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:17,353
What are you talking about?
It's like you don't even care.

591
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:20,438
- Just do what I say, Angie.
- He'd want us to come for him.

592
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:24,030
Just forget it. It's not gonna happen.
I'm through arguing with you.

593
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:28,358
I'm not asking for your permission. Cain
is in a hospital and we're gonna get him.

594
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,234
You've really thought this out now,
haven't ya? What about the cops?

595
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:35,158
We've got guns.
Damn it, Hob, Cain needs us!

596
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,236
Fuck Cain!

597
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,278
- He'd kill you if he heard that.
- He's not gonna kill anybody.

598
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,437
- You heard the news. He's probably dead.
- You shut the hell up!

599
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:48,189
You mouth off like that again
and it's no more Nuke for you, bitch.

600
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:53,079
Damn it, Hob, you know that's not fair.

601
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,794
Now, come on. It's been a bad time.

602
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,036
Sure has. You're really hurtin'.

603
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:02,354
- Yes, so I'm hurting.
- Gonna get the shakes soon, Angie.

604
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,470
You got it bad.

605
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,989
You little bastard.

606
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:14,791
You just do what I tell you
from now on, Angie.

607
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:17,869
Start the motor and drive.

608
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:23,150
He'll kill you.

609
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,236
He'll kill us both.

610
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,316
Fuck him.

611
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,116
Oh, you're a mess.

612
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,116
I got good news for you.

613
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:51,676
You're gonna have
a chance for immortality...

614
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:55,429
...as long as nothing happens
to that lovely brain.

615
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:06,515
Dr Weltman? It's Faxx.

616
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,390
I'm afraid we lost our patient.

617
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,909
Yeah, he just expired.

618
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:17,160
Contact the organ harvest team. We've
got six minutes before the brain's useless.

619
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,278
Night.

620
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:44,992
(Weltman) Come on, come on.
Let's move it. We've only got five minutes.

621
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,076
Lock it up.

622
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:52,318
- Temperature?
- (nurse) Optimum.

623
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,910
(Weltman) Move the screen in
a little closer. I can't read it.

624
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:00,599
- (surgeon) How'd we get this one?
- (Weltman) Well, Faxx found him.

625
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,031
He volunteered.

626
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:06,436
(surgeon) Volunteered? Big-hearted guy.

627
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:09,233
Yeah. It's not the heart
we're after, though.

628
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,712
(surgeon)
Speaking of hearts, how's llene?

629
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,274
Christ, does everybody know?

630
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:43,036
Hold your breath.

631
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,076
Now it's showtime.

632
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:51,470
It's nice and clean in here.
There's no damage.

633
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,717
Well... here we go.

634
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,670
Easy.

635
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,233
(surgeon) We got it. Here it comes.

636
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:03,396
- Thing of beauty.
- Excellent.

637
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:07,429
(Weltman) I don't know about
the rest of you, but I'm hungry.

638
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,836
(plays 'Born to be Wild')

639
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,114
Thank you, thank you. Yes, yes!

640
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:29,394
Spider Baby Stalirski. He's come out
for Detroit and now you come out for him.

641
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:32,557
The lines are open,
waiting for your pledge.

642
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:37,276
If you want an honest government,
a government that works for you...

643
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:41,632
...I'm asking you to dig deep
into your pockets.

644
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,433
I'm asking you to give...

645
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,475
...whatever you can spare.

646
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,955
Where does that put us, Gilly?

647
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,991
(phone rings)

648
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:57,869
Hi. Yes, ma'am.
Hello, this is Mayor Kuzak.

649
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:01,197
Could you turn down your set, please?

650
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,636
Your Honour...

651
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:09,274
...I have some very good news for you.

652
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:13,590
I think the city is saved.

653
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,871
Now...

654
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,230
...you listen very carefully.

655
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:23,512
Oh, it's no bluff. Someone's
shown up to bail the city out.

656
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:26,313
- A rival corporation?
- The mayor isn't saying...

657
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:30,115
...and whoever it is is taking great pains
to keep their identity a secret.

658
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:34,074
They're paying in cash and they're not
moving the money through the banks.

659
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,555
Thank you, Councilman.

660
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,951
That will be all.

661
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,275
You know, once you guys take over...

662
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:45,836
Your services to OCP will be rewarded.

663
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:54,391
- If the city can pay, we'll be humiliated.
- I think it's worse than that, sir.

664
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:58,911
We shifted 80 percent of our liquid
resources to the urban pacification plan.

665
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:04,034
If we can't foreclose, public confidence in
OCP will plummet and so will our stock.

666
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:08,199
Sir, if I may? There's another option.

667
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:13,838
We certainly have the surveillance
capabilities to follow the mayor.

668
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:17,396
It all depends on
how far we're willing to go.

669
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,237
If anything went wrong...

670
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:25,399
As I said, sir, it all depends
how far we're willing to go.

671
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:28,239
We have no legal recourse.

672
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:40,237
There must be no witnesses.

673
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:44,478
- You've gone too far!
- Think of your blood pressure.

674
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:48,195
You can get me fired. You are not
bringing illegal drugs into my lab!

675
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:51,835
I would do worse than get you fired.
Now, leave me alone.

676
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,836
Such terrible pain.

677
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,596
You don't remember me.

678
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:13,076
But you do remember this, don't you?

679
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:22,033
And we have it.
All the Nuke you'll ever need.

680
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:28,589
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

681
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:33,475
Not so fast. I need you
to do something for me first.

682
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,396
Then the pain stops.

683
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,233
Good boy.

684
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:01,550
I don't like this. I think we'd better
get outta here while we can.

685
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,636
I know what I'm doing.

686
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:35,354
If you have any cash,
put it in your shorts.

687
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:37,710
That's just plain rude.

688
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,993
I wonder if any of you could help me?
I'm looking for a Mr Hob.

689
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:56,998
So, how much you need?

690
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:02,559
- Money, I mean.
- Well, our current debt to OCP is...

691
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:04,548
Bob?

692
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:07,956
$37,480,911.

693
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,596
Guess you're in some pretty deep shit.

694
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:12,836
We need all the help
we can get, young man.

695
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,952
Tell you what, put me down
for 50 just to make sure.

696
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,355
50 cents? 50 dollars? That's cute.

697
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,756
Don't be a queer. 50 million.

698
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:24,997
This is bullshit. Let's get outta here.

699
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,596
Good God.

700
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:00,156
Gentlemen? Well? Will 50 do it?

701
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,558
Oh, yes, yes, that'll do it.

702
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:07,989
- Don't you guys think that'll do it?
- Yeah.

703
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:11,032
50 mill. That will do it.

704
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,916
For God's sake,
these people are criminals.

705
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:17,077
Why do you have to label people?
I hate labels.

706
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,713
You shut up.

707
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:46,432
But we cannot capitulate
in the war on crime.

708
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,916
I'd be voted outta office,
and I don't think anyone wants that.

709
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:54,158
War on crime's fine with us.
It's business we're talkin' about here.

710
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:57,113
Do you have any idea
how many people we employ?

711
01:16:57,240 --> 01:17:01,756
You know, I... I never thought
about it like that. Sharp kid.

712
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:07,194
So, your war on crime,
you wanna win it or what?

713
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,514
We're the only chance you have.

714
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:14,235
Listen to him. He's got it all worked out.

715
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:22,870
Why do people do crimes?

716
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,556
Why drugs. People do drugs.

717
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:29,309
Because they want drugs.
The kind that cost too much.

718
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:33,117
Nuke gives high quality at a cheap price.

719
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:36,357
- If you get off our backs, it'll be cheaper.
- And safer.

720
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:39,119
We don't go shovin' our shit
down anybody's throat.

721
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:42,437
And we don't advertise it like
they do with cigarettes or booze.

722
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:47,270
So leave us alone and
anybody who wants it, gets it.

723
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,596
So no more crimes. You get to be
the mayor who cleaned up Detroit.

724
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,156
He's got a point.

725
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:08,795
- Don't you think he's got a point?
- Yeah, he's got a point.

726
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:16,475
What the hell is that?

727
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,516
Get out!

728
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,592
- Marv...
- Shh!

729
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:44,876
Agh!

730
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,436
Cain.

731
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,869
Oh, wow!

732
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,956
(growls)

733
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,352
You look great.

734
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,916
(Angie) Oh.

735
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:11,118
Oooh!

736
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:14,473
It'll take some getting used to, but...

737
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:18,636
...it'll be great, Cain.

738
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:24,076
(growls)

739
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:29,077
Agh!

740
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:41,876
(police siren)

741
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:47,917
(Hob groans)

742
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,556
Lie still.

743
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:23,356
- I'm cold.
- You are going into shock.

744
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,320
I will call for a medical emergency unit.

745
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:28,796
Wait. No.

746
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:33,240
Don't leave me.

747
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:36,876
I won't leave you.

748
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:45,349
- Who did this?
- It was big.

749
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:48,189
Bigger than you.

750
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,358
It was Cain.

751
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:54,196
I'm gonna die.

752
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,959
You know what that's like, don't you?

753
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,076
It really sucks.

754
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:10,436
(whispers) Yes.

755
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:33,759
(TVpresenter) 13 dead in what appears
to be a Nuke-money massacre.

756
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:37,111
Among the victims, two city councilmen.

757
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:40,038
Was the city trying to
strike a deal with the drug lords?

758
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:45,314
No comment! I said I have no comment!
Now, no comments on these allegations.

759
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:48,238
These were men who served
this city tirelessly.

760
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:52,558
However, I make a promise
to the people of Detroit City...

761
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:55,831
...that no effort will be spared
to investigate this thoroughly.

762
01:26:55,960 --> 01:27:00,272
- But Mr Mayor...
- I'm sorry. No more questions.

763
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:04,279
(TV presenter) Our own Mayor Kuzak.
Now let's go live to Jess.

764
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:09,349
(Jess) And here it is, the Civic Centrum,
OCP's 100-storey gift to the Motor City.

765
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:12,472
While debate continues
over OCP's hostile takeover...

766
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,955
...there's no denying
the mood here is festive.

767
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:18,470
Citizens interviewed on the scene
expressed excitement and hope...

768
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:22,718
...that OCP will make good on
its promise of a better life in Detroit.

769
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:24,910
- Press.
- Sorry, folks, media only.

770
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:28,157
TV and press only.
You'll have to step back.

771
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:37,836
(woman) There he is!

772
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:46,749
- Can OCP bring industry back to Detroit?
- Can a corporation own the government?

773
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:51,032
- Are you gonna hold elections?
- Why aren't you going to City Hall?

774
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:54,994
Just a minute. I'll answer that, young lady.

775
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:59,796
City Hall is the decaying symbol
of mismanagement and corruption.

776
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:00,909
You get that?

777
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:04,874
This magnificent structure will be
the seat of leadership for the new Detroit.

778
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,072
And what better place
for a clean, fresh start?

779
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:12,955
And so, people of the press,
city officials...

780
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:19,155
...in a few minutes, Omni Consumer
Products and the troubled city of Detroit...

781
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:22,875
...will join in a bold new venture.

782
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:27,073
Now, I'd like to explain
just what this will mean.

783
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,839
Sometimes we just have to start over...

784
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:33,589
...from scratch, to make things right.

785
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:36,917
And that's exactly what we're going to do.

786
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:41,950
We're going to build a brand new city,
where Detroit now stands...

787
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:45,237
...an example to the world.

788
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:52,753
(trumpets)

789
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:00,476
(applause)

790
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:10,352
My friends, welcome to
our city as it should be...

791
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:15,793
...and as it will be, in the hands
of responsible private enterprise.

792
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:22,919
And a special welcome to Mayor Kuzak
and the outgoing administration.

793
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:25,474
Oh, we're not goin' anywhere.

794
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,556
Your Honour.

795
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:32,158
You'll have to tear down a lot
of people's houses to make that.

796
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,236
You're gonna take away their homes.

797
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:37,079
We're going to raise towers
of glass and steel.

798
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:41,113
Every citizen will have
a living unit, safe, secure and clean.

799
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:44,755
- Now, please, take your seat.
- Won't be room for neighbourhoods.

800
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,996
Not like the kind that we all grew up in.

801
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:50,317
These days neighbourhoods
are places where bad things happen.

802
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:54,592
- Don't be nostalgic.
- And democracy? Nobody elected you.

803
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:59,669
Anyone can buy OCP stock
and own a piece of our city.

804
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,830
What could be more
democratic than that?

805
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:07,317
Well, there are a lot of people in this town
that can't afford to buy your stock!

806
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,749
And they're not gonna
let you get away with this.

807
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:12,758
You haven't been following the polls.

808
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:15,436
Sit down.

809
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:24,869
About a year ago
we gave this city RoboCop.

810
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,150
I think he's worked out pretty well...

811
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,840
...but things have become
a little rougher out there.

812
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:32,599
Now we need a law enforcement unit...

813
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:35,280
...capable of meeting the enemy
on his own ground...

814
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:39,791
...and carrying enough fire power
to get the job done.

815
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:42,916
(trumpets)

816
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:47,036
Ladies and gentlemen...

817
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:49,116
...with great pleasure...

818
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:52,277
...I give you RoboCop 2.

819
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:04,318
- Bastards! Maniacs!
- What's the matter?

820
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:07,273
I can't believe it. It was them! They sent it!

821
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:10,472
- Sent what?
- Nothin'.

822
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:15,230
There's going to be a big call for this unit
and we'll make him right here in Detroit.

823
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:18,272
That means jobs we can all be proud of...

824
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:22,598
...and make 'Made in America'
mean something again.

825
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:24,950
(applause)

826
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:30,356
This single container holds
enough Nuke to addict a city block.

827
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:34,113
A hundred of these
are produced every day...

828
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:38,756
...and sent to sweatshops where
urban slaves prepare this poison...

829
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:41,792
...for our friends,
our loved ones, our children.

830
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:46,710
Now I say it's high time
we put an end to this plague.

831
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:54,110
RoboCop 2 will seek out every laboratory,
every dealer and rid our city of Nuke.

832
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:02,478
Ah, yes, things will be
a lot quieter with this boy around.

833
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:21,112
- What's wrong with him?
- It's nothing. It's nothing at all.

834
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:24,789
- Turn him off.
- I can't.

835
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:27,150
(RoboCop) Cain, let's step outside!

836
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:32,713
You! Get outta here! You're obsolete!

837
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:34,558
That thing is a killer!

838
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:37,797
- It's not even armed. It's harmless.
- It's a killer and I saw it!

839
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:55,993
- Get her out of here, now!
- Let me go! No!

840
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:18,350
Behave yourselves!

841
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:07,874
- What's the deal here?
- It sounds like there's a war going on.

842
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,835
You're coming with me, Cain.

843
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:58,108
(screaming)

844
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:31,271
Are you jealous of the replacement?

845
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:38,712
(man) Take him out!

846
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:22,911
This could look bad for OCP, Johnson.

847
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:25,554
Scramble the best spin team we have.

848
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:34,716
(man) Ammo! Ammo!

849
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:56,356
Get down!

850
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:20,792
Hold your fire! Hold your fire, damn it!

851
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:44,469
All right, let's get him outta here.

852
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:48,274
Watch his neck. He's hurt bad. Easy.

853
01:40:55,160 --> 01:40:57,116
Shit!

854
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,958
- I gotta get back.
- Movin'back, movin' back.

855
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:08,036
(screaming)

856
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:18,034
Let's give him what he wants.

857
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:14,912
Goodbye.

858
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:48,235
It's serious trouble,
so many dead and wounded.

859
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:52,433
- There won't be trouble from the dead.
- They'll have relatives, they always do.

860
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:55,393
- It'll be a feeding frenzy.
- It's only money.

861
01:43:55,520 --> 01:44:00,355
- What about criminal proceedings?
- Well, we're looking at major indictments.

862
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:02,596
- Prison terms.
- What about me?

863
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:05,757
- You know we'll do whatever we can.
- That's not good enough.

864
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:08,394
Sir, what if this was
all the work of one individual?

865
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:12,399
A person with her own agenda that wasn't
in sync with the goals of our company?

866
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:15,193
Well, that usually works.

867
01:44:15,720 --> 01:44:20,589
A woman who was not a team player,
who violated our trust?

868
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:28,633
Well, we'd need
some evidence to support that.

869
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:31,274
Sir, whether it exists or not,
I know I can find it.

870
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:34,153
She did choose the brain, sir.

871
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:38,154
- Good thinking.
- Sir.

872
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:41,317
Thank God you're all right.
I was so worried.

873
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:45,672
- I thought it was going to hurt you.
- No, no. It's over. It's all over.

874
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:49,634
- I failed you.
- Don't be hard on yourself.

875
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:52,320
Everything is going to be all right.

876
01:44:54,880 --> 01:45:00,034
Johnson, that business we were
talking about - get right on it.

877
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,956
Yes, sir.

878
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:13,558
Just look at what they've done.
They are criminals.

879
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:16,353
OCP won't own this city for long.
I'll see to that.

880
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:18,789
I will take it to the streets, to the people.

881
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:23,152
Is this what it's come to? Businessmen
can buy our rights like stock?

882
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:25,271
You don't realise what we're losing!

883
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:31,797
- Give us a statement, sir.
- Sir, we have dozens dead.

884
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:34,639
Is this your idea of a better life?

885
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:38,435
That monster was crazy.
How did this happen?

886
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:40,949
How do you account for this disaster?

887
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:44,231
Will OCP make reparations to the victims?

888
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:49,437
That son of a bitch is getting away with it.
We can't even touch him.

889
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:52,510
Patience, Lewis.

890
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:56,035
We're only human.
