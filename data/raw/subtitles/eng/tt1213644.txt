1
00:01:48,752 --> 00:01:50,777
Oh, shit.

2
00:02:11,307 --> 00:02:12,467
You just got Wolfed.

3
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,241
- What?
- That is an official trademark...

4
00:02:15,445 --> 00:02:17,007
...that I am
getting registered.

5
00:02:17,414 --> 00:02:20,383
It's a lot of stuff you gotta do,
hoops you gotta jump through.

6
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:21,811
Gotta get on the Internet.

7
00:02:22,018 --> 00:02:26,182
Gotta go to some stupid-ass website
where you register a catch phrase.

8
00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:29,722
I wanted "Bam,"
but Emeril had taken it.

9
00:02:31,227 --> 00:02:33,354
I'm rambling, man.
Get up, man. Get up, man.

10
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,164
Is the contender ready?

11
00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:40,768
- Ready.
- Is the gladiator ready?

12
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:45,339
Three, two, one.

13
00:02:45,809 --> 00:02:47,401
Things are heating up for the Wolf.

14
00:02:47,977 --> 00:02:49,842
I just opened a Target in Reseda...

15
00:02:50,513 --> 00:02:53,243
...and my own brand of BBQ sauce.

16
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:59,086
I'm calling it Wolf's BBQ Sauce,
available in regular and chipotle.

17
00:03:00,523 --> 00:03:02,753
You still going?
You still want more of this, man?

18
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,950
I learned that in Oriental land.

19
00:03:05,161 --> 00:03:08,028
Whoa, yeah. U.S. A!

20
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:16,037
They're so small anyway, from steroids.

21
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:41,123
A saber-tooth.

22
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:45,833
Amy Winehouse?

23
00:03:51,107 --> 00:03:52,301
Piss off.

24
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:55,478
You don't wanna mess with
a bitch straight out of rehab.

25
00:03:56,279 --> 00:04:01,649
Listen, like the dinosaurs
being destroyed by the Ice Age...

26
00:04:01,851 --> 00:04:05,252
...you, too, will soon be extinct.

27
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:06,683
When?

28
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,791
- How much time do we have?
- Bloody hell.

29
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:13,023
Just calm down.
Do you know you're speaking so fast...

30
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:16,596
...I can't even hear, mate?
You're making my head hurt.

31
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,699
Or maybe that was
the gasoline I drank.

32
00:04:18,902 --> 00:04:23,737
Oh, my God, it was good.
Oh, God, I love drinking gasoline.

33
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,204
It's excellent for the vocal cords.

34
00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:28,001
That's my little secret.

35
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:30,509
- You're welcome.
- How much time do we have?

36
00:04:31,548 --> 00:04:33,277
Let me see.

37
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:34,609
Hang on a bit.

38
00:04:36,085 --> 00:04:37,143
There we go.

39
00:04:38,187 --> 00:04:40,485
All right, let's have a look-see.

40
00:04:43,226 --> 00:04:44,818
Everyone's on Facebook.

41
00:04:45,028 --> 00:04:46,996
It says...

42
00:04:48,231 --> 00:04:54,170
...that the end of the world
will be August 29th, 2008.

43
00:04:57,674 --> 00:04:58,732
Oh, God.

44
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,607
Bottoms up.

45
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,584
Sick.

46
00:05:53,262 --> 00:05:56,459
Mark my words, leather boy.

47
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,630
Cave dweller.

48
00:05:58,835 --> 00:06:01,429
Beaver hunter.

49
00:06:03,272 --> 00:06:08,073
Your doom lies with this.

50
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,272
- The crystal skull.
- That's right. Did your nibblies go tight?

51
00:06:14,484 --> 00:06:16,975
Yeah, they did. Just went up
inside you, didn't they?

52
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:27,255
Oh, boy.

53
00:06:33,803 --> 00:06:36,704
I knew I shouldn't have
taken all those Ambien.

54
00:06:46,082 --> 00:06:49,950
Amy. Wake up, baby.
I just had the weirdest dream.

55
00:06:50,586 --> 00:06:52,053
Amy.

56
00:06:52,355 --> 00:06:53,788
What? What the...?

57
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,357
Flava-Flav! Yeah, boy!

58
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,858
I've been giving your girl
the flavor of love.

59
00:07:00,063 --> 00:07:03,624
She's been sucking
my clock all night long.

60
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,357
Get the hell out of here, Flava!

61
00:07:06,202 --> 00:07:08,500
I'm Flava-Flav!

62
00:07:12,408 --> 00:07:14,774
- What is that about?
- What?

63
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:17,207
You said you didn't
wanna be in a relationship.

64
00:07:18,114 --> 00:07:20,708
I know, but Flava?

65
00:07:22,085 --> 00:07:23,712
Will...

66
00:07:25,455 --> 00:07:27,355
...I wanna take it to the next level.

67
00:07:32,662 --> 00:07:33,822
I love you.

68
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:37,532
I like you too.

69
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:41,867
Oh, man.

70
00:07:43,206 --> 00:07:45,231
Look, you don't understand.

71
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:47,875
I think the world is coming to an end.

72
00:07:48,911 --> 00:07:51,141
That's a way of saying
you have commitment issues.

73
00:07:53,082 --> 00:07:56,540
Unbelievable. Come on, Jojo.

74
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:00,413
You're taking Jojo?

75
00:08:01,924 --> 00:08:02,913
Goodbye, Will.

76
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:07,521
Are you still coming
to my Sweet 16 party?

77
00:08:08,097 --> 00:08:09,564
You're 25.

78
00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:12,234
- I never had one.
- Grow up.

79
00:08:39,295 --> 00:08:40,626
Yeah.

80
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:46,166
- Hey.
- Yeah.

81
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,211
Amy, you came.

82
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,937
Come on.

83
00:09:23,739 --> 00:09:25,331
Oh, hey, Will.

84
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,771
- Happy Sweet 16.
- Thanks.

85
00:09:28,344 --> 00:09:30,904
Take a look at these.

86
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,580
Oh, God.

87
00:09:35,384 --> 00:09:38,979
Hey, Will. It's your buddy, Dr. Phil.

88
00:09:42,525 --> 00:09:45,460
Hey, let me show you
why my frat brothers...

89
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:48,528
...used to call me Dr. Phil-You-Up.

90
00:09:48,731 --> 00:09:50,756
Oh, hey, baby.

91
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:58,467
Dyke. Come back here, I like it rough.

92
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:02,108
Hey, Will, where's that
girlfriend of yours, Amy?

93
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:04,211
Don't let her get away.

94
00:10:04,413 --> 00:10:08,440
She's a real quality girl,
a real keeper, like that one.

95
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:10,346
Hey, come on back here, you whore.

96
00:10:10,887 --> 00:10:12,445
Thanks.

97
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:15,714
Yo!

98
00:10:16,192 --> 00:10:19,855
Let's prank his ass. He passed out.

99
00:10:29,238 --> 00:10:30,500
He's sleeping like a baby.

100
00:10:31,073 --> 00:10:33,837
We can put his hands in warm water.

101
00:10:35,311 --> 00:10:36,539
Or I have a better idea.

102
00:10:36,746 --> 00:10:39,476
- Call it.
- Tails.

103
00:10:42,251 --> 00:10:43,240
It is tails.

104
00:10:56,232 --> 00:10:57,756
Punch.

105
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,062
What's up, baby?

106
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:05,606
Those guys are trying
to steal our booze.

107
00:11:05,808 --> 00:11:07,537
- What?
- We gotta get the alcohol...

108
00:11:07,743 --> 00:11:10,906
...so we can get the girls drunk
so we can finally get laid.

109
00:11:11,113 --> 00:11:12,444
I am McLover.

110
00:11:12,648 --> 00:11:14,912
- Yeah, I know.
- I am McLover.

111
00:11:15,117 --> 00:11:18,245
- Stop saying that.
- I am McLover.

112
00:11:18,454 --> 00:11:20,183
God, you are such a douche.

113
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:22,687
Yeah, fake ID, what?

114
00:11:23,192 --> 00:11:25,092
Just get the booze.

115
00:11:25,294 --> 00:11:27,387
Nobody tries to steal my GoldschlÃ¤ger.

116
00:11:27,596 --> 00:11:29,689
Shoot the target.

117
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:35,529
Lisa, how am I supposed to do that?
I don't even have a clear shot.

118
00:11:45,014 --> 00:11:47,539
- Curve the bullet.
- Say what?

119
00:11:48,184 --> 00:11:51,915
You can control the bullet
to go wherever you want.

120
00:11:57,293 --> 00:11:59,420
Don't tell him what to do. He's my man.

121
00:11:59,628 --> 00:12:01,721
Back off, bitch.
You don't want none of me.

122
00:12:07,136 --> 00:12:08,626
Shit.

123
00:12:10,006 --> 00:12:11,132
Get off of me.

124
00:12:19,849 --> 00:12:21,646
Come on, bitch.

125
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,992
Take that, bitch.

126
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:46,633
How do you like that?

127
00:12:52,415 --> 00:12:55,316
Pretty little thing.
Oh, look at you laying there.

128
00:12:55,518 --> 00:12:59,045
I should kiss you. Give me a kiss, baby.

129
00:13:16,038 --> 00:13:17,835
Left foot, yellow.

130
00:13:19,075 --> 00:13:20,508
Calvin?

131
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:22,370
Calvin.

132
00:13:22,578 --> 00:13:25,547
- Are you gonna curve the bullet or what?
- Hello?

133
00:13:26,148 --> 00:13:28,582
Yeah. Yeah, right, right.

134
00:13:32,254 --> 00:13:34,814
Let's go back to my hot tub.
You can suck on my...

135
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:39,221
- Damn.
- Sorry, Phil.

136
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:47,002
Shit. I can... I can do this.

137
00:13:53,275 --> 00:13:55,072
- Shit. Hurry up.
- Dude.

138
00:13:56,245 --> 00:13:58,406
Just curve the bullet.

139
00:13:58,614 --> 00:14:00,775
I know you have the power.

140
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:21,559
Fucking hurry up. Hurry up.

141
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:24,572
Nice shot, asshole.

142
00:14:32,548 --> 00:14:35,745
<i>Juney, why won't you</i>
<i>Have an abortion?</i>

143
00:14:35,951 --> 00:14:39,011
<i>You're not exactly part of</i>
<i>The Christian Coalition</i>

144
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:43,555
<i>I could just grab a wire hanger</i>
<i>And do it myself</i>

145
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:48,889
<i>Like Jamie Lynn Spears</i>
<i>I'm keeping this baby</i>

146
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:52,226
<i>And, look, stud</i>
<i>You are no George Clooney</i>

147
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:57,064
<i>In fact, I just sold the baby</i>
<i>To the highest bidder on eBay</i>

148
00:15:01,977 --> 00:15:05,105
<i>You're a sarcastic teen</i>
<i>Who talks like she's</i> 30...

149
00:15:20,262 --> 00:15:22,492
- Think Amy's coming tonight?
- Man, I don't know.

150
00:15:22,698 --> 00:15:24,723
That's your girlfriend.

151
00:15:24,934 --> 00:15:26,492
Actually, we broke up.

152
00:15:26,702 --> 00:15:29,034
Oh, you want some new booty.

153
00:15:29,238 --> 00:15:30,466
- A little Asian freak.
- No...

154
00:15:30,673 --> 00:15:33,039
A little "One Night in Bangkok,"
a little <i>sake-sake.</i>

155
00:15:33,242 --> 00:15:36,177
I saw <i>Memoirs of a Geisha.</i>
I know that shit goes on.

156
00:15:36,378 --> 00:15:38,346
I'm in love with her.

157
00:15:38,547 --> 00:15:40,640
Then what your dumb ass
break up with her for?

158
00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:42,612
It never would've worked out.

159
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:45,048
It's better to end it
than to end up hurting her.

160
00:15:45,254 --> 00:15:47,950
You know what?
You got commitment issues, dog.

161
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:51,183
Well, I didn't exactly have
the best example growing up.

162
00:15:51,393 --> 00:15:53,793
I never even knew my dad.
He split when I was young.

163
00:15:55,931 --> 00:15:58,058
That's your girl right there.

164
00:16:01,704 --> 00:16:02,898
Who's that dude she with?

165
00:16:03,105 --> 00:16:06,199
She started dating some
Calvin Klein underwear model.

166
00:16:10,713 --> 00:16:13,580
Forget about her, man.
I got something that'll cheer you up.

167
00:16:17,553 --> 00:16:20,545
Dude, what is up
with the marching band?

168
00:16:20,756 --> 00:16:23,554
What better way to celebrate
your super-duper Sweet 16...

169
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,751
...than with a high school musical?

170
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,697
<i>Tonight, tonight</i>
<i>We're gonna get real crunk</i>

171
00:16:38,907 --> 00:16:42,536
<i>Tonight, tonight,</i>
<i>A bum's peeing in the punch</i>

172
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:51,616
<i>Hello, my friends</i>
<i>You're all at my party</i>

173
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,847
<i>It's so good to see all of you</i>

174
00:16:56,058 --> 00:17:00,085
<i>My ex-girl, Amy</i>
<i>And my main man, Calvin</i>

175
00:17:00,296 --> 00:17:04,198
<i>And the priest that molested me too</i>

176
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,097
<i>That reminds me</i>
<i>Of the time I was in college</i>

177
00:17:08,304 --> 00:17:10,864
<i>I was experimenting</i>

178
00:17:12,508 --> 00:17:16,205
<i>Hooking up with a hot</i>
<i>Foreign-exchange student</i>

179
00:17:16,412 --> 00:17:20,314
<i>I think his name was Hop Sing</i>

180
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:24,647
<i>We'll all be friends forever</i>

181
00:17:24,853 --> 00:17:28,983

<i>We'll all be friends forever</i>

183
00:17:33,162 --> 00:17:38,031
<i>Because if that happened</i>
<i>It'd be kind of shitty</i>

184
00:17:39,034 --> 00:17:41,127
<i>One, two, three, four</i>

185
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:45,367
<i>After we split</i>
<i>I took the break-up real hard</i>

186
00:17:45,574 --> 00:17:49,738
- <i>I started foolin' around</i>
- <i>Foolin' around</i>

187
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:53,779
<i>I did a black dude</i>
<i>I thought he was Kanye</i>

188
00:17:53,982 --> 00:17:57,679
<i>And the Jonas Brothers all got down</i>

189
00:17:57,886 --> 00:18:01,822
<i>Now that you're split</i>
<i>I'll get her hooked on the reefer</i>

190
00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:06,358
<i>Yeah, I'll start pimping her out</i>

191
00:18:06,562 --> 00:18:09,030
- Wait, what?
- Hey, hey, now.

192
00:18:09,431 --> 00:18:12,696
<i>Snoop Dogg's got nothin' on this playa</i>

193
00:18:12,901 --> 00:18:17,770
<i>I'll get the first prize at the Playa's Ball</i>

194
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,870
<i>Hey, hey, man, whoa!</i>

195
00:18:21,076 --> 00:18:24,409
<i>Yeah, it's going on and on</i>
<i>We can do it all day long</i>

196
00:18:24,613 --> 00:18:27,741
<i>It's the new phenomenon, whoa!</i>

197
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:31,852
<i>Yeah, it's going on and on</i>

<i>We'll all be friends forever</i>

201
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:50,002
<i>Because if that happened</i>

00:18:51,206 --> 00:18:53,367
<i>One, two, three, four</i>

203
00:18:53,575 --> 00:18:56,305
J.T.'s here. J. T!

204
00:18:59,815 --> 00:19:01,339
<i>Oh, babe</i>

205
00:19:03,051 --> 00:19:05,747
<i>If I sang you a melody</i>

206
00:19:05,954 --> 00:19:10,414
<i>Would you toss me</i>
<i>Your panties?</i>

207
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:18,891
<i>I don't mean to be a boastful man</i>

208
00:19:19,101 --> 00:19:21,126
<i>But I've done groupies</i>

209
00:19:21,336 --> 00:19:23,201
<i>Britney, Cameron, Scarlett too</i>

210
00:19:23,405 --> 00:19:25,498
<i>They all like a taste of my fondue</i>

211
00:19:26,842 --> 00:19:30,710
<i>Come to think of it</i>
<i>I've had so much ass</i>

212
00:19:30,913 --> 00:19:33,541
<i>All that's left for me is Lance Bass</i>

213
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,885
Look, everyone. It's Jessica Simpson.

214
00:19:52,601 --> 00:19:56,093
<i>My boobs are for Jesus</i>

215
00:19:56,305 --> 00:19:58,603
<i>All of this, all for Jesus</i>

216
00:19:58,807 --> 00:20:00,365
Put your pants back on, Dad.

217
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:04,307
Go, Romo! Oh, my God.
He's gonna score a basket goal.

218
00:20:04,513 --> 00:20:07,243
Wait. What's it called again?
Oh, my gosh, I totally forget.

219
00:20:07,449 --> 00:20:09,576
What is it, a rubdown?

220
00:20:09,785 --> 00:20:11,685
What? A tickle down.

221
00:20:11,887 --> 00:20:14,583
Oh, a touchdown.

222
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,314
Frigging jinx.

223
00:20:18,293 --> 00:20:19,885
Gosh.

00:20:20,662 --> 00:20:24,257

<i>One, two, three, four, hooray!</i>

229
00:20:46,188 --> 00:20:47,678
What's going on?

230
00:20:54,696 --> 00:20:55,754
What the hell was that?

<i>Something has jolted the city.</i>

235
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:07,902
<i>We're getting reports it could be</i>

236
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,134
Oh, shit.

237
00:21:09,344 --> 00:21:13,041
<i>Seismologists have marked</i>

Oh, God, we're all gonna die!

242
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:28,186
Take a Xanax, Fabio.

243
00:21:28,397 --> 00:21:32,333
You're wigging harder than a
smack addict at an Iggy show circa '73.

244
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:33,927
What?

245
00:21:34,136 --> 00:21:38,129
It's cool, Moe Dee. Sir Cries-a-Lot.

246
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,731
You're totally giving me the stink eye.

247
00:21:42,578 --> 00:21:44,512
FYI, Battlecrotch Galactica...

248
00:21:44,713 --> 00:21:46,943
...you're grape smuggling
harder than Cornelius...

249
00:21:47,149 --> 00:21:51,051
...in <i>Planet of the Apes.</i>
The original, not Tim Burton's.

250
00:21:51,253 --> 00:21:54,245
And BT-dubs,
I haven't seen a six-pack like that...

251
00:21:54,456 --> 00:21:57,892
...since I shotgunned
Molson Golden at Lollapalooza.

252
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,425
I don't understand a thing you're saying.

253
00:22:00,629 --> 00:22:05,066
That's because I speak in overly written,
clever-for-clever's-sake quips.

254
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:16,439
Time to get this sea monkey plastered.

- Yeah.

257
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,238
Why did you bring
another guy to my party?

258
00:22:44,439 --> 00:22:47,203
- Why do you care?
- Because l...

259
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,077
I don't.

260
00:22:51,613 --> 00:22:53,205
I'm out of here.

261
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:54,609
Later, bitch.

262
00:22:56,018 --> 00:22:57,246
You know what, Will?

263
00:22:57,452 --> 00:23:00,944
Every time we made love,
I was thinking about another guy.

264
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:03,447
Well, so was I.

265
00:23:07,696 --> 00:23:09,493
- Damn it.
- Will!

266
00:23:10,499 --> 00:23:12,057
You gotta hear this.

267
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:15,562
<i>The quake erupted a gas main</i>
<i>and destroyed the ghetto.</i>

- Oh, hell, no.

<i>out of the sky and...</i>

271
00:23:25,147 --> 00:23:26,307
End of the world.

272
00:23:26,515 --> 00:23:28,642
<i>And a Pinkberry</i>
<i>has just been destroyed.</i>

273
00:23:33,822 --> 00:23:35,153
It's like my dream.

274
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:40,455
<i>I repeat, a Pinkberry</i>
<i>has just been destroyed.</i>

275
00:23:59,648 --> 00:24:01,582
God, what the hell's happening?

276
00:24:01,783 --> 00:24:04,274
- I think it's the apocalypse.
- It's Armageddon.

277
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,044
I think I just shit myself.

278
00:24:22,304 --> 00:24:23,293
Let's go.

279
00:24:26,308 --> 00:24:29,072
Oh, my God. Hannah Montana's dead.

280
00:24:31,213 --> 00:24:33,647
Oh, no.

281
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:37,285
Well, goodbye, all my fans.

282
00:24:37,486 --> 00:24:39,044
Keep rocking.

283
00:24:47,095 --> 00:24:50,861
She is a national treasure!

284
00:24:54,736 --> 00:24:56,931
Also, remind your parents...

285
00:24:57,139 --> 00:25:00,575
...to pick up your official
Hannah Montana lunchbox...

286
00:25:00,776 --> 00:25:02,937
...Hannah Montana cheese grater...

287
00:25:03,145 --> 00:25:05,079
...and Hannah Montana toilet paper.

288
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,977
And be sure to tune in
to my Summer in Montana concert...

289
00:25:09,184 --> 00:25:13,314
...this Wednesday, 8, 7 Central.

290
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:19,216
I waited in line
for two days for these tickets.

291
00:25:19,427 --> 00:25:20,951
Damn.

292
00:25:23,198 --> 00:25:29,433
And let me just say, those totally sexy
and utterly provocative pictures of me...

293
00:25:29,638 --> 00:25:35,076
...were leaked onto MySpace
completely without my permission.

294
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:38,011
But if you'll notice in those pictures...

295
00:25:38,213 --> 00:25:40,181
...l'm wearing my new line of sexy...

296
00:25:40,382 --> 00:25:46,082
...Hannah Montana lingerie,
now available at Target.

297
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:57,788
Oh, my God. Hannah Montana
is really Miley Cyrus.

298
00:25:57,999 --> 00:26:00,763
Well, duh. No shit, Sherlock.

299
00:26:00,969 --> 00:26:04,427
All I do is wear a wig
and change my voice a little bit...

300
00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:07,802
...and those dumb kids
can't tell the difference.

301
00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:11,604
Then I get twice the pay
and twice the merchandise.

302
00:26:11,813 --> 00:26:14,179
Just a reminder,
my new CD comes out.

303
00:26:14,382 --> 00:26:17,317
<i>Miley Cyrus: Underage.</i>

304
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:22,115
It's available in stores now.
Featuring songs from my dad, Billy Ray.

305
00:26:22,324 --> 00:26:25,623
Only 9.95.

306
00:26:29,931 --> 00:26:31,330
Can somebody help us?

307
00:26:31,533 --> 00:26:33,467
Isn't there anybody that can help?

308
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,037
Hey, Hancock.

309
00:26:41,009 --> 00:26:42,670
Hancock?

310
00:26:43,545 --> 00:26:44,773
We need help.

311
00:26:46,715 --> 00:26:48,376
Wake up, you drunk motherfucker.

312
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:51,780
Get your punk ass up,
fly down there, and fix that shit.

313
00:26:53,755 --> 00:26:55,620
Asshole!

314
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,163
Oh, hell, no.

315
00:27:03,365 --> 00:27:05,162
Big Willie's out of here.

316
00:27:12,974 --> 00:27:15,067
I need a drink.

317
00:27:23,084 --> 00:27:24,847
Holy shit!

318
00:27:25,053 --> 00:27:27,317
- It's coming this way.
- What should we do?

319
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:30,457
- Come on, guys. Let's get out of here.
- Let's go!

320
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:35,321
This way. Over here.
Come on. Come on.

321
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:36,888
Go, go, go.

322
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:47,698
- What are we gonna do now?
- Baby, I don't know.

323
00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:49,171
Look, we'll just...

324
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:52,005
We'll wait out the storm here
until it passes by.

325
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:56,573
Hey.

326
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:03,024
This is our hiding place.

327
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:06,352
Get lost. Right, Carrie?

328
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,253
Hello, lover.

329
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:14,626
Unless you wanna fight.

330
00:28:14,836 --> 00:28:16,895
Look, we don't want any trouble.

331
00:28:23,511 --> 00:28:24,739
I never back down.

332
00:28:24,946 --> 00:28:29,815
- Get some.
- As you can see, I already did.

333
00:28:33,621 --> 00:28:37,284
<i>And so I thought: Could a simple</i>
<i>New York City gal like me...</i>

334
00:28:37,492 --> 00:28:41,258
<i>... really beat the shit</i>
<i>out of a pregnant teenager? I wonder.</i>

335
00:28:41,463 --> 00:28:45,957
Like Dolph Lundgren in <i>Rocky IV,</i>
I must break you.

336
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:55,833
- Yes!
- Yeah!

337
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:18,129
I'm lactating. Moo.

338
00:29:20,001 --> 00:29:22,299
Got milk?

339
00:29:30,712 --> 00:29:32,373
Oh, God.

340
00:29:38,753 --> 00:29:40,448
- Is that your feet?
- Yeah.

341
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:43,215
And this is my baby's foot.

342
00:29:45,927 --> 00:29:47,224
Smell it.

343
00:29:49,264 --> 00:29:50,288
And taste it.

344
00:29:52,033 --> 00:29:54,058
Suck on my placenta.

345
00:29:57,172 --> 00:29:59,936
- Yeah!
- Oh, Carrie.

346
00:30:00,141 --> 00:30:02,132
Carrie, darling, are you all right?

347
00:30:02,343 --> 00:30:05,005
Come on, ladies.
Let's get out of here now.

348
00:30:11,086 --> 00:30:12,986
- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know.

349
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:15,713
Wake up and smell the Prius.

350
00:30:15,924 --> 00:30:19,826
I know it's an inconvenient truth,
but it's called global warming.

351
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:22,861
No. No, it's not global warming.

352
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:26,560
Amy Winehouse
came to me in my dreams...

353
00:30:26,768 --> 00:30:28,599
...after I fought an American Gladiator.

354
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,561
I think it has something to do
with the crystal skull...

355
00:30:32,941 --> 00:30:35,671
Come on. Crackhead Winehouse?
Crystal skull?

356
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:37,174
You sound like a crazy man.

357
00:30:37,378 --> 00:30:40,905
Look, it's getting late. Let's just stay
here tonight and wait out the storm.

358
00:30:41,349 --> 00:30:42,680
I'm freezing.

359
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:44,617
We gotta take off our clothes.

360
00:30:46,688 --> 00:30:50,317
- What?
- Our bodies will keep each other warm.

361
00:30:50,525 --> 00:30:53,392
Otherwise, we're not gonna make it
through the night.

362
00:30:54,362 --> 00:30:55,693
Yeah. Yeah.

363
00:30:56,131 --> 00:30:58,622
He's right. Come on.

364
00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:09,868
I think my water's gonna break.

365
00:31:10,612 --> 00:31:11,601
Water?

366
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,011
What the...?

367
00:31:18,186 --> 00:31:19,778
Sorry.

368
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:26,989
Look, I have something to tell you.
I'm not really a banker.

369
00:31:27,195 --> 00:31:28,719
- I'm a jumper.
- A what?

370
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,659
I can teleport through time and space.

371
00:31:59,928 --> 00:32:02,362
I hope we stay together forever.

372
00:32:02,564 --> 00:32:03,758
I love you.

373
00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:07,532
Later.

374
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:14,972
I am Prince Caspian,
here to save Narnia.

375
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:19,637
Little help?

376
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:22,943
You guys?

377
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:29,123
It's the guy who ruined <i>Star Wars.</i>

378
00:32:34,729 --> 00:32:37,664
- What?
- Will, we saw your dream.

379
00:32:40,635 --> 00:32:42,933
- Oh, man.
- Man, you messed shit up with Amy.

380
00:32:43,137 --> 00:32:45,731
You're lucky a girl like that
would even talk to you.

381
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:49,034
She's hot, sexy. She got a job.

382
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:52,902
- Man, that girl out your league.
- She's not out of my league.

383
00:32:53,114 --> 00:32:55,878
Shit, she gotta put up
with your stank breath.

384
00:32:56,551 --> 00:32:59,918
Not to mention your
abnormally high plumber's crack.

385
00:33:05,126 --> 00:33:06,423
Man, put your shirt down.

386
00:33:06,628 --> 00:33:09,654
All right. You're right, you're right.
I messed up with Amy.

387
00:33:12,967 --> 00:33:14,730
I never should've let her go.

388
00:33:17,238 --> 00:33:19,866
Jesus Christ. That was a rump shaker.

389
00:33:20,074 --> 00:33:23,407
Okay, here's the plan.
We gotta get the hell up out this city.

390
00:33:23,611 --> 00:33:25,203
What you say?

391
00:33:25,947 --> 00:33:29,212
What the hell y'all doing leaving me?

392
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:33,914
Keep it moving, people. Nothing to see.

393
00:33:34,922 --> 00:33:38,255
All the disasters have been contained.
The city is secure.

394
00:33:44,632 --> 00:33:45,621
Shit.

395
00:33:47,135 --> 00:33:48,124
Sick.

396
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:53,897
Like I said, keep moving.
It's under control.

397
00:33:58,913 --> 00:33:59,902
I'm out of here.

398
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:09,523
- What was that?
- That was a head. That was a head.

399
00:34:09,724 --> 00:34:12,215
- Hello?
- Whose head?

400
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:13,724
- Hello?
- <i>Will, it's me.</i>

401
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:15,725
Amy, where are you?

402
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:18,990
I'm at work at the museum.
I was worried about the artifacts.

403
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,135
- Are you okay?
- I'm scared.

404
00:34:22,737 --> 00:34:24,728
It's gonna be all right, I promise. Listen.

405
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:27,703
There is something
that I need to tell you...

406
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:30,173
...and I should've told you long before.
I was an idiot.

407
00:34:34,315 --> 00:34:35,339
I love you.

408
00:34:37,852 --> 00:34:40,150
<i>Oh, baby, I love you too.</i>

409
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:46,090
What do...? What do you say?
Do you still love me?

410
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:49,024
<i>Yes, yes, of course, yes.</i>

411
00:34:49,731 --> 00:34:50,720
<i>Say something.</i>

412
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,358
Say something, you stuck-up bitch.

413
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,166
Asshole.

414
00:35:01,008 --> 00:35:02,600
Hello? Hello, Amy?

415
00:35:03,511 --> 00:35:05,138
Shit.

416
00:35:07,582 --> 00:35:09,379
Oh, what the...?

417
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:12,051
- We gotta go back.
- Say what?

418
00:35:12,253 --> 00:35:14,050
Amy's in trouble.
I'm going back for her.

419
00:35:14,255 --> 00:35:16,348
I let her go before.
I'm not losing her again.

420
00:35:16,557 --> 00:35:19,754
Man, you crazy. There's all kinds
of shit breaking out in the city.

421
00:35:19,961 --> 00:35:22,452
We don't leave right now,
we're gonna die.

422
00:35:22,663 --> 00:35:24,324
It's something I gotta do.

423
00:35:24,532 --> 00:35:25,624
You guys keep going.

424
00:35:29,103 --> 00:35:31,196
No, I'm your boy, man.
I'm gonna roll with you.

425
00:35:31,406 --> 00:35:33,806
Yeah, I mean, I'm already knocked up...

426
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:38,172
...so, what other shenanigans
can I really get into?

427
00:35:38,379 --> 00:35:41,906
I mean, I'm more bloated
than Vince Vaughn in <i>The Break-Up...</i>

428
00:35:42,116 --> 00:35:44,550
...or Vince Vaughn in <i>Fred Claus...</i>

429
00:35:46,053 --> 00:35:48,021
...or I guess Vince Vaughn in general.

430
00:35:48,222 --> 00:35:50,918
- So let's go.
- Yeah, please.

431
00:35:53,327 --> 00:35:54,885
Lisa, come on.

432
00:35:55,096 --> 00:35:57,189
- No, guys.
- Come on, baby.

433
00:35:57,398 --> 00:35:59,366
I really have a bad feeling about this.

434
00:36:04,405 --> 00:36:05,895
Lisa!

435
00:36:06,107 --> 00:36:07,665
They killed Lisa!

436
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:09,001
- Lisa!
- Come on, come on.

437
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:12,304
- They killed Lisa! You bastards!
- Come on, come on. We gotta go.

438
00:36:12,513 --> 00:36:14,037
Come on.

439
00:36:21,656 --> 00:36:24,557
I'm really sorry about your girlfriend,
home skillet.

440
00:36:24,759 --> 00:36:27,557
<i>Lo ciento</i> about your main squeeze,
kemosabe.

441
00:36:27,762 --> 00:36:33,598
I'd offer you my sexual favors, but
I've got a lot of mucus discharge lately.

442
00:36:33,801 --> 00:36:35,063
Lisa was a great girl.

443
00:36:45,279 --> 00:36:47,304
Lisa who?

444
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:49,045
Oh, where am I?

445
00:36:49,517 --> 00:36:51,917
Oh, what an enchanting place.

446
00:36:53,821 --> 00:36:56,881
It smells like meat and stress.

447
00:37:00,561 --> 00:37:01,619
Wonderful.

448
00:37:02,497 --> 00:37:03,964
What magical creature are you?

449
00:37:10,571 --> 00:37:12,038
<i>My dear prince</i>

450
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:20,614
<i>You have rescued me</i>
<i>You've caught me in your arms</i>

451
00:37:20,815 --> 00:37:26,082
<i>Actually, you landed on my balls</i>

452
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:27,618
Let me guess.

453
00:37:27,822 --> 00:37:31,815
An evil witch banished you
from your fairy-tale kingdom?

454
00:37:33,828 --> 00:37:36,296
No, my silly, pasty, quirky teen.

455
00:37:36,497 --> 00:37:39,989
Actually, I'm just a demented
homeless chick who lives in the sewers.

456
00:37:41,135 --> 00:37:42,796
- How'd you end up there?
- Drugs.

457
00:37:43,004 --> 00:37:46,303
Lots and lots and lots...

458
00:37:46,507 --> 00:37:51,137
...of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!

459
00:37:53,614 --> 00:37:55,639
I don't judge.

460
00:37:58,352 --> 00:37:59,910
It's dangerous out there.

461
00:38:00,121 --> 00:38:02,954
You might wanna come with us
if you wanna live.

462
00:38:03,157 --> 00:38:04,590
- Okay.
- All right.

463
00:38:04,792 --> 00:38:07,727
- Goodbye. Oh, I'm going with you.
- Yes, you are.

464
00:38:07,929 --> 00:38:10,796
The Natural History Museum
is just uptown. Let's go.

465
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:20,639
<i>Dreams and fairy tales</i>
<i>My true love</i>

466
00:38:21,275 --> 00:38:26,178
<i>Talking squirrels and magic and stuff</i>

467
00:38:26,814 --> 00:38:29,715
No, princess, wait.
Where are you going?

468
00:38:29,917 --> 00:38:32,351
And who's that Moorish ruffian?

469
00:38:32,553 --> 00:38:34,851
I'm her new boyfriend. What it do?

470
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:39,518
Very funny, dark peasant.
I'm Prince Edwin.

471
00:38:40,595 --> 00:38:43,928
- Princess, he your pimp?
- Oh, good heavens, yes.

472
00:38:45,967 --> 00:38:49,334
But that's all right.
I could have a pimp and a boyfriend.

473
00:38:50,237 --> 00:38:51,431
Oh, what to do?

474
00:38:53,841 --> 00:38:58,403
Whichever prince can vanquish
the other shall win my hand.

475
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:06,611
You ready to step up?

476
00:39:08,089 --> 00:39:10,148
Wait. You mean like
the first <i>Step Up</i> movie...

477
00:39:10,358 --> 00:39:13,054
...where the street-dancer dude
went to the dance academy?

478
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,319
No, I was thinking
more like <i>Step Up 2...</i>

479
00:39:15,529 --> 00:39:18,430
...when the tough street-dancing chick
went to dancing academy.

480
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:20,391
I feel you.

481
00:39:20,601 --> 00:39:24,435
He ain't ready for me. Juney, Will,
I'm about to break him down, baby.

482
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:26,971
You want some? Well, here you go.

483
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:38,313
Oh, a hoedown?

484
00:39:40,655 --> 00:39:41,644
It's crazy-shirt man.

485
00:39:46,861 --> 00:39:48,954
Oh, no, no, no.

486
00:39:54,168 --> 00:39:55,567
It's just my sleeve.

487
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,795
Oh, come on.

488
00:39:58,706 --> 00:40:00,571
He's double-jointed.
Who cares about that?

489
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,568
There must be a mirror somewhere.

490
00:40:07,248 --> 00:40:09,113
Make some room. Make some room.

491
00:40:09,316 --> 00:40:10,578
Make some room.

492
00:40:10,785 --> 00:40:13,276
- Come on, chubby.
- Okay.

493
00:40:14,889 --> 00:40:16,857
What? What? What?

494
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:19,952
Oh, damn, that ho is all on point.

495
00:40:30,871 --> 00:40:33,635
That bitch better work.
She is off the chizzain.

496
00:40:33,841 --> 00:40:34,967
I think she's crowning.

497
00:40:37,845 --> 00:40:39,608
I want to dance.

498
00:40:39,814 --> 00:40:43,181
I'm not sure I can though. I'm not sure.

499
00:40:43,384 --> 00:40:46,353
l... Don't pressure me!

500
00:40:48,155 --> 00:40:49,782
I'm ready.

501
00:40:50,324 --> 00:40:52,724
Oh, look out. Look at her coming in.

502
00:40:54,395 --> 00:40:55,521
Oh, yeah.

503
00:41:37,171 --> 00:41:39,332
I'm out of here.

504
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,268
Bye.

505
00:41:41,475 --> 00:41:43,909
She's all yours, bro.

506
00:41:44,512 --> 00:41:45,843
It's a twister!

507
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:48,241
Run! Run!

508
00:41:55,823 --> 00:41:57,950
Is there anyone that can save us?

509
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:00,059
We need a hero.

510
00:42:08,202 --> 00:42:09,897
I am Iron Man.

511
00:42:12,506 --> 00:42:15,566
Oh, man! That twister shat out a cow.

512
00:42:17,044 --> 00:42:18,409
Shit. That's so messed up.

513
00:42:22,349 --> 00:42:24,783
Now you're pissing me off.

514
00:42:27,655 --> 00:42:30,146
I'm the only badass around here.

515
00:42:32,626 --> 00:42:34,321
Oh, damn!

516
00:42:34,528 --> 00:42:36,223
Another cow?

517
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,437
What was that?

518
00:42:44,638 --> 00:42:46,003
It's not nice.

519
00:42:46,207 --> 00:42:48,607
Look at me. Look at this.

520
00:42:48,809 --> 00:42:50,401
It's a lobster claw.

521
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:51,600
Whatever.

522
00:42:51,812 --> 00:42:55,407
Look, I'm carrying a lot of baggage.
I didn't need that, man.

523
00:42:59,286 --> 00:43:03,723
Don't make me angry.
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.

524
00:43:04,191 --> 00:43:07,991
There's aspects of my personality
that I can't control.

525
00:43:25,846 --> 00:43:27,746
At least he didn't get hit with a cow.

526
00:43:30,484 --> 00:43:33,351
- Man!
- Hey, Casanova, forget Amy.

527
00:43:33,554 --> 00:43:35,454
We're never gonna make it
to the museum.

528
00:43:35,656 --> 00:43:36,987
I know she's still alive.

529
00:43:37,191 --> 00:43:39,455
<i>Hello? Jojo?</i>

530
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,220
Jojo? No, no, it's me.

531
00:43:42,429 --> 00:43:44,693
Will. Will, I'm trapped.

532
00:43:44,899 --> 00:43:48,494
<i>An Egyptian statue fell on me</i>
<i>during the earthquake.</i>

533
00:43:48,702 --> 00:43:50,863
<i>Stay calm, Amy. Just stay calm.</i>

534
00:43:51,071 --> 00:43:53,904
I'm so scared. I'm so scared.

535
00:43:54,108 --> 00:43:56,804
All right, Amy, listen to me. Don't panic.

536
00:43:59,747 --> 00:44:01,544
I will be there, I promise.

537
00:44:05,085 --> 00:44:07,315
Amy? Amy?

538
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:11,751
Guys, I'm going back for her.

539
00:44:14,595 --> 00:44:18,531
You can't save her if you're dead!
Come on, let's go!

540
00:44:18,732 --> 00:44:20,563
- I'll be there as soon as I can.
- Go, go.

541
00:44:20,768 --> 00:44:21,860
Goodbye.

542
00:44:22,069 --> 00:44:23,263
- Amy. No!
- Will, let's go.

543
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:25,165
- No! Damn it!
- You got to!

544
00:44:34,682 --> 00:44:35,979
I know you think I'm crazy...

545
00:44:36,183 --> 00:44:39,050
...but these disasters have to do
with the crystal skull.

546
00:44:39,253 --> 00:44:42,711
- It's like TMTH.
- TM what?

547
00:44:42,923 --> 00:44:45,050
Too much to handle.

548
00:44:45,459 --> 00:44:47,051
Bitch, why you don't just say that?

549
00:44:47,261 --> 00:44:49,923
Why everything a goddamn acronym
with you?

550
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:53,122
Chilly Willy out, LL Not Cool J.

551
00:44:53,334 --> 00:44:57,202
Oh, do stop all of this quarreling.
Honestly.

552
00:44:57,404 --> 00:44:59,964
Now, who's hungry?

553
00:45:08,449 --> 00:45:09,814
Delicious.

554
00:45:10,651 --> 00:45:12,414
Whatever.

555
00:45:13,787 --> 00:45:14,947
Would you like some?

556
00:45:15,422 --> 00:45:16,446
No.

557
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:25,154
What?

558
00:45:25,733 --> 00:45:28,463
Y'all, that's my <i>Get Smart</i> phone.
Just give me a minute.

559
00:45:37,611 --> 00:45:39,636
You got poop.

560
00:45:40,147 --> 00:45:41,136
Just a smidge.

561
00:45:45,319 --> 00:45:48,152
Did I get it? Did I get it all?

562
00:45:49,757 --> 00:45:51,622
What y'all looking at me like that for?

563
00:45:51,825 --> 00:45:53,349
You got... Yeah.

564
00:45:53,961 --> 00:45:54,950
Is it right there?

565
00:45:55,796 --> 00:45:58,287
- It's fine.
- Just go:

566
00:45:58,665 --> 00:46:01,031
Just... I get it all the time, all over.

567
00:46:05,806 --> 00:46:07,433
What it do?

568
00:46:10,444 --> 00:46:13,936
Hey, y'all, it's Lisa's mom.

569
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:16,972
I gotta tell her what happened
to her daughter.

570
00:46:21,955 --> 00:46:23,650
Hi, Miss Heller.

571
00:46:28,128 --> 00:46:29,618
Lisa...

572
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:31,722
Lisa dead.

573
00:46:34,201 --> 00:46:35,566
But booyah!

574
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:40,006
I met this fine, hot
enchanted-princess chick...

575
00:46:40,207 --> 00:46:43,699
...willing to do anything
and everything I want.

576
00:46:43,911 --> 00:46:46,038
You gotta talk to her. Talk to her.

577
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:50,774
Hello? Oh, yes, he's right.
I will do anything. Truly.

578
00:46:50,984 --> 00:46:54,283
I'm not referred to on the street
as the Cavernous Princess for nothing.

579
00:46:54,488 --> 00:46:57,548
A nomenclature well-deserved,
most assuredly.

580
00:46:57,758 --> 00:47:00,158
If you've got 5 bucks or some meth,
I'll show you.

581
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,658
One time I hooked up
with a 100-year-old wizard.

582
00:47:02,863 --> 00:47:06,492
His penis kept reappearing
in all sorts of different places.

583
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,190
Never again.

584
00:47:08,402 --> 00:47:11,565
You're so cool.
We should totally hang out.

585
00:47:11,772 --> 00:47:13,569
<i>She's awesome.</i>

586
00:47:13,774 --> 00:47:15,935
Look, we gotta get to Amy
at the Natural History Museum.

587
00:47:20,314 --> 00:47:21,338
Oh, my.

588
00:47:21,782 --> 00:47:24,683
- Oh, no.
- I can't see anything.

589
00:47:24,918 --> 00:47:28,820
- Neither can I.
- Somebody is totally feeling me up.

590
00:47:29,022 --> 00:47:31,252
- Calvin.
- I didn't do it.

591
00:47:34,094 --> 00:47:36,927
They're so perky.
They're filled with milk.

592
00:47:39,433 --> 00:47:41,401
What the hell was that?

593
00:48:27,414 --> 00:48:31,145
Wonderful.
What adorable woodland creatures.

594
00:48:31,351 --> 00:48:34,843
I'm not merry, really. That didn't...
I mean, that didn't make me merry.

595
00:48:35,055 --> 00:48:38,081
I don't feel merry, I guess.

596
00:49:14,228 --> 00:49:15,559
Man, them guys are all right.

597
00:49:16,163 --> 00:49:17,790
That's cute. That's cute.

598
00:49:52,633 --> 00:49:56,694
Okay, you guys are not
Alvin and the Chipmunks, are you?

599
00:49:59,306 --> 00:50:00,671
I think that one's got rabies.

600
00:50:05,612 --> 00:50:07,307
Where you going, punk-ass?

601
00:50:10,484 --> 00:50:12,748
Alvin!

602
00:50:18,659 --> 00:50:20,354
Get him off!

603
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,528
Chipmunks love nuts.

604
00:50:27,834 --> 00:50:31,201
Get him off! What the hell?
I thought you was my friend!

605
00:50:31,872 --> 00:50:32,861
Salty.

606
00:50:38,645 --> 00:50:41,637
You're hitting the wrong thing! You...!

607
00:50:48,255 --> 00:50:52,385
I feel left out.
No one's biting my flesh. Pooh.

608
00:50:56,697 --> 00:50:58,562
Is that the best you got, pussy?

609
00:51:02,536 --> 00:51:03,628
You are such a girl.

610
00:51:19,219 --> 00:51:20,914
Redrum!

611
00:51:30,797 --> 00:51:32,594
Where'd he go?

612
00:51:41,074 --> 00:51:42,200
Yeah!

613
00:51:45,645 --> 00:51:47,442
Don't bite me. Get lost!

614
00:51:56,323 --> 00:51:58,484
Oh, boy, tasty vertebrae.

615
00:51:59,493 --> 00:52:00,721
- Juney.
- Let her go.

616
00:52:00,927 --> 00:52:02,792
Let her go, man.
Ain't nothing we can do.

617
00:52:02,996 --> 00:52:04,361
But she's still alive.

618
00:52:04,564 --> 00:52:05,929
They're munching me harder...

619
00:52:06,133 --> 00:52:10,331
...than Rachael Ray chowing down
eggs Benedict on <i>$40 a Day.</i>

620
00:52:10,537 --> 00:52:11,561
Yeah.

621
00:52:11,772 --> 00:52:16,141
Even when the bitch is dying,
she don't shut up with her witty repartee.

622
00:52:16,343 --> 00:52:20,040
Hey, BFFs, what's the 411 on the 911?

623
00:52:20,247 --> 00:52:22,545
Oh, she is rather annoying.

624
00:52:22,749 --> 00:52:26,742
WTH? I'm so not ROTFLOL'ing...

625
00:52:26,953 --> 00:52:32,050
...but please KIT, before I get 187'd.

626
00:52:33,326 --> 00:52:35,226
Blog you later.

627
00:52:36,363 --> 00:52:38,228
- Finally.
- Finally.

628
00:52:38,965 --> 00:52:41,695
That was just the amuse bouche.
Now the main course.

629
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:48,405
- Come back here, you bitches.
- Bitches!

630
00:52:48,608 --> 00:52:50,667
I'll get you in your grill.

631
00:52:50,877 --> 00:52:52,401
Pussies.

632
00:52:52,612 --> 00:52:53,670
Die!

633
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:57,281
Can't breathe. Need air.

634
00:52:59,286 --> 00:53:00,844
Shitheads!

635
00:53:08,061 --> 00:53:10,188
Is everybody okay?

636
00:53:10,397 --> 00:53:12,092
Yeah, I'm okay.

637
00:53:12,299 --> 00:53:15,860
Hey, baby, your knees
are all skinned up.

638
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:19,230
Oh, yes, but that's not
from the chipmunks.

639
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,972
But I do have this terrible headache.

640
00:53:24,644 --> 00:53:27,112
<i>Head On.</i>
<i>Apply directly to the forehead.</i>

641
00:53:27,314 --> 00:53:29,748
<i>Head On.</i>
<i>Apply directly to the forehead.</i>

642
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:32,418
<i>Head On.</i>
<i>Apply directly to the forehead.</i>

643
00:53:32,619 --> 00:53:34,746
<i>Head On.</i>
<i>Apply directly to the forehead.</i>

644
00:53:34,955 --> 00:53:36,718
I just... I just did.

645
00:53:36,923 --> 00:53:38,390
<i>I said, Head On, bitch.</i>

646
00:53:38,592 --> 00:53:40,560
- <i>Apply directly to the forehead.</i>
- Whatever.

647
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,250
<i>Don't cop an attitude, slut.</i>

648
00:53:42,462 --> 00:53:46,023
<i>I said, apply Head On directly</i>
<i>to your goddamn forehead.</i>

649
00:53:46,233 --> 00:53:49,100
Okay, okay. Happy?

650
00:53:49,302 --> 00:53:51,327
<i>Look, you little white-trash</i>
<i>piece of shit...</i>

651
00:53:51,538 --> 00:53:52,698
<i>... Head On, motherfucker.</i>

652
00:53:52,906 --> 00:53:55,636
<i>Apply directly to your</i>
<i>motherfucking forehead.</i>

653
00:53:55,842 --> 00:53:58,936
Okay? There. It's all over.

654
00:53:59,145 --> 00:54:03,741
Head on, face on, nose on, eyes on.

655
00:54:05,852 --> 00:54:07,581
Oh, that's great.

656
00:54:07,787 --> 00:54:09,152
My headache is gone...

657
00:54:09,356 --> 00:54:12,450
...but I still have that dreadful
yeast infection.

658
00:54:13,793 --> 00:54:15,192
Sourdough anyone?

659
00:54:15,962 --> 00:54:18,760
- I could've did without that.
- Let's get to the museum.

660
00:54:23,336 --> 00:54:25,531
- Let's go!
- Move it!

661
00:54:25,739 --> 00:54:27,707
Out of the way!

662
00:54:36,182 --> 00:54:37,774
Excuse me, sir.

663
00:54:37,984 --> 00:54:40,009
What's going on?
Where's everybody going?

664
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:43,348
It's a mass evacuation. Everyone
has to leave the city right now.

665
00:54:43,557 --> 00:54:45,320
Hold up, hold up.
You leaving, Batman?

666
00:54:45,525 --> 00:54:49,359
Shit. Yes. Yeah, I'm leaving. Okay?
I don't wanna die.

667
00:54:49,563 --> 00:54:51,656
Not on my schedule today.
Not on my to-do list.

668
00:54:51,865 --> 00:54:55,198
It wasn't, "Wake up, make breakfast, jog,
science experiment, die."

669
00:54:55,402 --> 00:54:59,395
Not on it. Not on it. Okay?
Are we done?

670
00:54:59,606 --> 00:55:00,971
All right.

671
00:55:01,641 --> 00:55:04,474
Anyone who stays in town
is gonna be buried in rubble.

672
00:55:04,678 --> 00:55:05,804
I hate rubble.

673
00:55:06,012 --> 00:55:09,675
I've gotta get to the Natural History
Museum, to my girl, Amy. She's trapped.

674
00:55:09,883 --> 00:55:13,319
If you go back after your girlfriend,
you have zero chance of survival.

675
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:14,814
I'll take those odds.

676
00:55:17,691 --> 00:55:21,525
- She must be some piece of pussy.
- She is, sir. She is.

677
00:55:23,029 --> 00:55:26,328
Look, the evacuation bus
is leaving city hall at 2100 hours.

678
00:55:26,533 --> 00:55:29,297
Twenty-one hundred?
Hold on, what is...? That's...

679
00:55:29,502 --> 00:55:31,663
- Five, carry the six...
- Nine p.m.

680
00:55:31,871 --> 00:55:34,533
I'm gonna save you your crazy math.
It's 9 p.m.

681
00:55:34,741 --> 00:55:37,039
You start at noon, then nine hours later.

682
00:55:37,243 --> 00:55:40,542
That's 9. That's the time you need
to get on those evacuation buses...

683
00:55:40,747 --> 00:55:42,237
...or you're dead.

684
00:55:42,449 --> 00:55:43,916
Dead?

685
00:55:45,251 --> 00:55:47,412
Come on, it's already 5:30.

686
00:55:48,221 --> 00:55:50,553
Say again, 5:30? Oh, Jesus.

687
00:55:50,757 --> 00:55:53,282
Oh, God. I wasted the whole day.

688
00:55:53,493 --> 00:55:56,758
I was... I was on Amazon
looking for stuff.

689
00:55:56,963 --> 00:56:00,296
Shit. Why? Why would I
go Christmas shopping today?

690
00:56:00,967 --> 00:56:04,801
Why would I pick today?
Son of a bitch. Okay, plan B.

691
00:56:09,643 --> 00:56:10,974
- Hi.
- Hi.

692
00:56:11,177 --> 00:56:12,201
I'm Batman.

693
00:56:12,412 --> 00:56:14,209
I'm Enchanted Princess.

694
00:56:14,414 --> 00:56:17,008
True story: I had a woman one time...

695
00:56:17,217 --> 00:56:21,483
...tell me I was in the top four
best lovers she's ever had.

696
00:56:21,688 --> 00:56:23,087
That's a true story.

697
00:56:23,289 --> 00:56:24,916
And she had been around the block.

698
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:31,556
Would you want to watch me
play with myself?

699
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:34,188
Goodbye.

700
00:56:45,779 --> 00:56:47,269
Come on, let's go.

701
00:56:50,483 --> 00:56:51,780
Break yourself, fool.

702
00:56:51,985 --> 00:56:55,079
You best be getting out of that Mach 5
or I'll toe-tag your ass.

703
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:06,325
You know, they say that the first kill...

704
00:57:06,533 --> 00:57:08,330
...is supposed to be quite difficult.

705
00:57:08,535 --> 00:57:12,198
But I find it easy. In fact, rather fun.

706
00:57:13,173 --> 00:57:15,971
Take it. Do it.

707
00:57:21,514 --> 00:57:23,243
Look, Ma, no eyes.

708
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:24,974
I didn't have a mother!

709
00:57:28,722 --> 00:57:31,691
That was better than sex with a camel.

710
00:57:43,136 --> 00:57:46,162
What? We're just playing
with my monkey.

711
00:57:50,777 --> 00:57:52,335
Let's roll.

712
00:57:55,849 --> 00:57:56,975
Oh, my!

713
00:58:09,229 --> 00:58:10,218
Come on!

714
00:58:12,565 --> 00:58:13,896
Run.

715
00:58:15,602 --> 00:58:17,399
We gotta keep going.

716
00:58:19,038 --> 00:58:21,905
These glass slippers
are awfully hard to run in.

717
00:58:30,083 --> 00:58:31,744
Help. Help.

718
00:58:32,552 --> 00:58:33,849
Amy.

719
00:58:35,955 --> 00:58:38,219
- You came back for me.
- I love you, Amy.

720
00:58:38,892 --> 00:58:41,793
I know. I love you too.

721
00:58:43,463 --> 00:58:45,761
Now get this freaking spear
out of my shoulder.

722
00:58:45,965 --> 00:58:46,954
Yeah.

723
00:58:47,901 --> 00:58:49,232
- Okay.
- It hurts.

724
00:58:49,435 --> 00:58:50,595
Okay. All right.

725
00:58:50,804 --> 00:58:52,795
She's pinned through to the floor, guys.

726
00:58:53,006 --> 00:58:55,770
This isn't gonna be easy.
Calvin, I'm gonna need your help.

727
00:58:55,975 --> 00:58:57,602
Right.

728
00:59:02,248 --> 00:59:05,183
- What was that for?
- I was trying to knock her unconscious...

729
00:59:05,385 --> 00:59:06,750
...so she wouldn't feel pain.

730
00:59:08,021 --> 00:59:09,648
Good thinking.

731
00:59:10,256 --> 00:59:13,623
- Baby, this is for your own good.
- Okay.

732
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,300
Man, you hit like a pussy. Let me try.

733
00:59:32,946 --> 00:59:34,607
Man, this girl can take a hit.

734
00:59:43,656 --> 00:59:45,419
Why?

735
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,360
It's not working.
Let's just pull it out of her.

736
00:59:51,064 --> 00:59:52,053
On the count of three.

737
00:59:52,265 --> 00:59:54,699
One, two, three.

738
00:59:54,901 --> 00:59:56,334
Good job.

739
01:00:08,181 --> 01:00:10,775
We gotta get out of here.
This place is gonna collapse.

740
01:00:11,351 --> 01:00:16,812
No. Not until we return this...

741
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:19,314
...back to the altar.

742
01:00:19,826 --> 01:00:21,555
A magic bong.

743
01:00:21,761 --> 01:00:24,594
The crystal skull.
The one from my dreams.

744
01:00:24,797 --> 01:00:29,200
Now, legend has it that if the
crystal skull is missing from the altar...

745
01:00:29,402 --> 01:00:31,563
...it's the end of the world.
Earthquakes...

746
01:00:31,771 --> 01:00:34,296
...asteroids, return of the Spice Girls.

747
01:00:34,507 --> 01:00:35,633
Yes!

748
01:00:37,243 --> 01:00:38,232
The apocalypse.

749
01:00:38,444 --> 01:00:40,969
And you know this shit
because you're the docent?

750
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,842
I saw <i>Indiana Jones and the Kingdom</i>
<i>of the Crystal Skull.</i>

751
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:45,642
Do you know what this means?

752
01:00:45,852 --> 01:00:48,719
Me dreaming about the skull,
and you knowing about the skull?

753
01:00:48,922 --> 01:00:52,517
- That we were destined to be together?
- No, that we both really love skulls.

754
01:00:53,626 --> 01:00:55,321
But that too.

755
01:00:56,963 --> 01:00:59,488
Will, we gotta get out of here.
It's almost 9:00.

756
01:00:59,699 --> 01:01:02,896
If we don't make it to them
evacuation buses, we're gonna die.

757
01:01:05,204 --> 01:01:06,603
Go, Calvin.

758
01:01:06,806 --> 01:01:09,832
I'm staying here with Amy.
We're returning the skull to the altar.

759
01:01:11,778 --> 01:01:13,439
- See you.
- Nice meeting you.

760
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,073
Let's find that altar.

761
01:01:44,077 --> 01:01:45,066
What's happening?

762
01:01:45,278 --> 01:01:48,543
Everything in the museum
is coming to life.

763
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:52,777
Hell, no!

764
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:55,248
Bully! Bully!

765
01:01:56,823 --> 01:01:57,983
Yes!

766
01:02:01,894 --> 01:02:04,624
- Let's get the hell up out of here.
- Drugs are great.

767
01:02:09,202 --> 01:02:12,171
- The altar to the crystal skull is this way.
- Okay.

768
01:02:18,344 --> 01:02:20,107
I am Beowulf.

769
01:02:24,817 --> 01:02:26,011
Hello.

770
01:02:28,688 --> 01:02:29,950
What?

771
01:02:31,224 --> 01:02:32,486
I am Beowulf.

772
01:02:34,227 --> 01:02:36,627
- Can you put some clothes on?
- I am Beowulf.

773
01:02:36,829 --> 01:02:40,663
I fought the monster Grendel with
no armor, and that is how I'll fight you.

774
01:02:41,567 --> 01:02:43,034
Wait. You fight naked?

775
01:02:46,105 --> 01:02:47,094
I am Beowulf.

776
01:02:47,306 --> 01:02:48,500
That's kind of gay, bro.

777
01:02:49,008 --> 01:02:50,976
It's not... It's not gay. It's...

778
01:02:51,177 --> 01:02:53,111
No, I'm sorry. That's gay.

779
01:02:53,312 --> 01:02:55,143
It's not gay. It's not.

780
01:02:55,348 --> 01:02:58,977
It's how we do it in 507, dick.

781
01:02:59,185 --> 01:03:02,052
- Ask anybody.
- All right, I will. I'll ask my friend Paul.

782
01:03:02,255 --> 01:03:05,383
We're boating tomorrow.
I'll ask him when we're out in the seas.

783
01:03:06,025 --> 01:03:09,358
- Paul?
- My friend Paul, who is my partner.

784
01:03:10,897 --> 01:03:13,388
He's my friend. We're also partners.

785
01:03:14,434 --> 01:03:17,164
- Life partner?
- No, business partners.

786
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:20,203
We opened an antique shop together.

787
01:03:20,406 --> 01:03:22,169
- That's gay.
- Why is that gay?

788
01:03:22,375 --> 01:03:25,742
Why are antiques gay? Because
I like old things that are kitschy?

789
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:29,709
I'm Beowulf!

790
01:03:30,149 --> 01:03:33,482
Excuse me, are you ready
to get your ass kicked?

791
01:03:39,826 --> 01:03:43,694
Oh, hell, no, Kung Fu Panda.

792
01:03:44,397 --> 01:03:46,888
You shouldn't have done that.

793
01:03:52,939 --> 01:03:55,533
Get ready to feel the thunder.

794
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:25,801
Your girl looks familiar, man.

795
01:04:26,005 --> 01:04:30,704
Last year, I paid her 20 bucks
for 20 minutes, if you know what I mean.

796
01:04:31,043 --> 01:04:33,603
It's true. And a curious factoid:

797
01:04:33,813 --> 01:04:37,044
Pandas actually have
three descending testicles.

798
01:04:38,851 --> 01:04:40,409
That's it.

799
01:05:33,272 --> 01:05:34,637
Oh, shit.

800
01:05:42,582 --> 01:05:44,709
Oh, wonderful job.

801
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:52,651
<i>My dear prince</i>
<i>You have defended my honor</i>

802
01:05:53,559 --> 01:05:55,254
Kiss me, baby.

803
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:21,586
- You a dude?
- I'm a trannie. I thought you knew.

804
01:06:22,788 --> 01:06:24,255
No.

805
01:06:35,268 --> 01:06:36,496
Get him, Will.

806
01:06:37,303 --> 01:06:39,771
- I am Beowulf.
- Yeah, I know already.

807
01:06:39,972 --> 01:06:42,532
Surrender so we can go get brunch.

808
01:06:42,742 --> 01:06:46,007
And I got us tickets to <i>Jersey Boys.</i>

809
01:06:46,245 --> 01:06:47,769
No.

810
01:06:59,925 --> 01:07:01,119
We can go to my place.

811
01:07:01,327 --> 01:07:05,161
I TiVo'd <i>Dancing with the Stars,</i>
results show.

812
01:07:05,364 --> 01:07:07,229
- No!
- Beowulf!

813
01:07:09,101 --> 01:07:11,797
I wanna take you
on Rosie O'Donnell's cruise.

814
01:07:12,004 --> 01:07:15,462
Just me, you,
and my dear friend George Takei.

815
01:07:15,975 --> 01:07:17,465
Screw this.

816
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:20,208
I'm Beowulf!

817
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:24,210
Beowulf out.

818
01:07:27,887 --> 01:07:29,445
Hurry, we're running out of time.

819
01:08:01,554 --> 01:08:03,146
Indiana Jones?

820
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:07,524
Indiana, my ass.

821
01:08:09,261 --> 01:08:10,489
I'll take it from here.

822
01:08:17,002 --> 01:08:20,438
Thanks, son.
That's right, I'm your father.

823
01:08:22,575 --> 01:08:25,544
- You're my dad?
- Your mom got around.

824
01:08:25,745 --> 01:08:28,612
- A real slut, actually.
- Right, I get it.

825
01:08:28,814 --> 01:08:30,304
She did this special thing...

826
01:08:30,516 --> 01:08:34,543
...with her big toe and candle wax...
- Okay.

827
01:08:34,754 --> 01:08:36,847
I'm sorry I walked out
on you and your mother.

828
01:08:37,056 --> 01:08:38,956
But I got an adventurous spirit...

829
01:08:39,158 --> 01:08:41,854
...and a hot-ass whore
in every major city.

830
01:08:43,496 --> 01:08:45,020
What do we have here?

831
01:08:45,231 --> 01:08:46,698
Is this your girl?

832
01:08:46,899 --> 01:08:50,130
- Yeah.
- What a nice young lady.

833
01:08:50,336 --> 01:08:52,133
And you got some shape on you.

834
01:08:52,338 --> 01:08:54,670
Yeah, baby. You're so nice.

835
01:08:54,874 --> 01:08:58,173
- And you got some ass on you.
- Dad.

836
01:08:58,377 --> 01:09:00,538
- Oh, so beautiful.
- Dad.

837
01:09:00,746 --> 01:09:04,648
If a nice ass meant a hamburger,
baby, you'd have a Whopper.

838
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:06,249
- Oh, shit.
- Dad.

839
01:09:06,452 --> 01:09:10,183
Do you do Pilates?
I'm just asking. Just asking.

840
01:09:13,659 --> 01:09:16,560
Don't do what your old man did.
Settle down.

841
01:09:18,130 --> 01:09:19,995
Hell, I got gonorrhea so many times...

842
01:09:20,199 --> 01:09:22,258
...my johnson looked like a melted
Baby Ruth.

843
01:09:23,736 --> 01:09:27,331
Hell, in the '70s, my nickname was
Chlamydia Jones.

844
01:09:28,707 --> 01:09:32,871
There is no cure for herpes,
and I bullshit you not.

845
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:35,408
Thanks, Dad.

846
01:09:57,736 --> 01:10:00,569
- This looks easy.
- Not as easy as it used to be.

847
01:10:04,810 --> 01:10:07,142
Oh, shit, my hip.

848
01:10:12,284 --> 01:10:15,276
- You know I gotta get my hustle on.
- Bye, Dad.

849
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:18,850
I'm gonna make it.

850
01:10:19,058 --> 01:10:20,650
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

851
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:22,122
Oh, shit!

852
01:10:25,231 --> 01:10:28,064
That hurts. Oh, shit!

853
01:10:55,394 --> 01:11:00,525
Why don't you just walk to the altar?
It's like 10 feet away.

854
01:11:01,534 --> 01:11:03,365
Silly girl.

855
01:11:10,709 --> 01:11:13,803
No, don't cry. I'll be fine.

856
01:12:00,659 --> 01:12:02,320
I am the Guru Shitka.

857
01:12:02,528 --> 01:12:06,157
And we are here today
to bring together Amy and Will...

858
01:12:06,365 --> 01:12:09,300
...in a union of peace and happiness.

859
01:12:09,501 --> 01:12:15,337
And to point out, gee,
Amy, you are totally hot. TM.

860
01:12:17,376 --> 01:12:18,934
Amy, do you take Will...

861
01:12:19,144 --> 01:12:22,841
...to be your peanut butter and jelly
that goes into your love belly?

862
01:12:23,048 --> 01:12:24,072
I do.

863
01:12:24,283 --> 01:12:28,686
And, Will, do you take Amy
to be your doughnut of love...

864
01:12:28,887 --> 01:12:31,879
...that you'll fill with cream every day?

865
01:12:32,091 --> 01:12:33,080
I do.

866
01:12:36,295 --> 01:12:39,594
Well, in that case, give her a pound.

867
01:12:40,532 --> 01:12:42,625
Lock it down.

868
01:12:43,002 --> 01:12:44,867
Break the pickle.

869
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:46,430
Now, tickle my pickle.

870
01:12:55,714 --> 01:12:56,703
I love you, Will.

871
01:12:56,915 --> 01:12:58,974
I love you too, Amy.

872
01:12:59,284 --> 01:13:01,718
But there's something I should tell you.

873
01:13:02,821 --> 01:13:03,810
What is it?

874
01:13:16,602 --> 01:13:17,830
<i>I'm fucking Matt Damon</i>

875
01:13:18,504 --> 01:13:20,836
You're fucking Matt Damon?

876
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,564
<i>Well, I'm fucking Hannah Montana</i>

877
01:13:22,775 --> 01:13:24,174
<i>She's fucking Hannah Montana</i>

878
01:13:24,376 --> 01:13:27,971
<i>Backstage at my concert</i>
<i>Fucks me on my parents' bed</i>

879
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:31,240
<i>After school, at my locker,</i>
<i>In the car I give her head</i>

880
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:32,974
<i>I'm also fucking the Flava</i>

881
01:13:33,185 --> 01:13:35,653
<i>Yeah, boy</i>
<i>She's fucking Flava-Flav, fool</i>

882
01:13:35,854 --> 01:13:38,652
<i>You know what time it is</i>
<i>Because I'm fucking Juney too</i>

883
01:13:39,725 --> 01:13:43,161
<i>Yeah, I know, but it's true</i>
<i>Flava-Flav, he fucks me too</i>

884
01:13:43,362 --> 01:13:46,627
<i>And I swap with Calvin</i>
<i>And he swaps with that dude</i>

885
01:13:46,832 --> 01:13:48,265
<i>And we're all fucking Hellboy</i>

886
01:13:49,034 --> 01:13:54,802
<i>Yeah, they're fucking Hellboy</i>
<i>And I'm fucking the Hulk</i>

887
01:13:55,007 --> 01:13:58,374
<i>When I get really mad</i>
<i>I start fucking Iron Man</i>

888
01:13:58,577 --> 01:14:01,774
<i>A most uncomfortable screw</i>
<i>But I fuck the princess too</i>

889
01:14:03,482 --> 01:14:05,347
<i>Who's that ringing on my bell?</i>

890
01:14:05,551 --> 01:14:07,314
<i>The bitch who's fucking Iron Man</i>

891
01:14:07,519 --> 01:14:12,286
<i>That's l-R-O-N M-A-N</i>
<i>And I fuck him in the mouth</i>

892
01:14:12,491 --> 01:14:15,983
<i>That's fucking great</i>
<i>Because I'm fucking Wolf</i>

893
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:20,091
<i>He's fucking Wolf</i>
<i>Ain't that a pity?</i>

894
01:14:20,299 --> 01:14:23,632
<i>Because I'm fucking those bitches</i>
<i>From</i> Sex and the City

895
01:14:25,037 --> 01:14:28,006
<i>He fucks the</i> Sex and the City <i>gals</i>

896
01:14:28,207 --> 01:14:31,005
So I wondered:
Would Wolf really get jealous...

897
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:34,202
...if he knew we were fucking
that guy with the big utility belt?

898
01:14:35,814 --> 01:14:37,042
<i>They're all fucking Batman</i>

899
01:14:37,249 --> 01:14:40,446
<i>At Wayne Manor, in the Batcave</i>
<i>Butler Alfred is our love slave</i>

900
01:14:40,652 --> 01:14:42,347
<i>Riddle me this</i>
<i>Holy bathhouse</i>

901
01:14:42,554 --> 01:14:44,044
<i>I'm fucking Amy Winehouse?</i>

902
01:14:44,256 --> 01:14:47,555
<i>He's fucking Amy Winehouse</i>

903
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,354
<i>Yeah, on the down-low, low, low</i>

904
01:14:50,562 --> 01:14:53,497
<i>And I'm fucking Jessica Simpson</i>

905
01:14:54,233 --> 01:14:57,396
<i>'Cause I'm on blow, blow, blow</i>

906
01:14:57,603 --> 01:15:01,562
<i>She's fucking Jessica Simpson</i>
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

907
01:15:01,774 --> 01:15:05,801
<i>And I think I might have fucked</i>
<i>That hot assassin</i>

908
01:15:06,011 --> 01:15:09,174
<i>Everyone's fucked me</i>
<i>And I've fucked them back, you see</i>

909
01:15:09,381 --> 01:15:12,714
<i>And the Mexican too</i>
<i>With the tragic hairdo</i>

910
01:15:13,152 --> 01:15:16,087
<i>Call it, heads, I'm fucking J. T.</i>

911
01:15:16,288 --> 01:15:19,223
<i>I'm fucking that male model</i>
<i>'Cause he's so fine</i>

912
01:15:19,424 --> 01:15:22,552
<i>And I like to get up</i>
<i>In them Calvin Kleins</i>

913
01:15:22,761 --> 01:15:29,132
<i>It's true, J. T. fucked my ass again</i>
<i>But I'm also fucking Prince Caspian</i>

914
01:15:29,668 --> 01:15:32,865
<i>I am handsome and I am cool</i>

915
01:15:33,071 --> 01:15:36,268
<i>That's why this prince</i>
<i>Fucks the kids from high school</i>

916
01:15:40,145 --> 01:15:41,635
- <i>Come on</i>
- <i>Let's hear it</i>

917
01:15:41,847 --> 01:15:43,781
- <i>Now's the time to party</i>
- <i>Let me hear you</i>

918
01:15:43,982 --> 01:15:46,143
- <i>You know what time it is?</i>
- <i>No, what time is it?</i>

919
01:15:46,351 --> 01:15:48,285
- <i>It's time to get fucked</i>
- <i>Fuck me</i>

920
01:15:48,487 --> 01:15:50,546
- <i>No, fuck me</i>
- <i>Fuck me</i>

921
01:15:50,756 --> 01:15:52,690
<i>He fucks all us kids in high school</i>

922
01:15:52,891 --> 01:15:56,827
<i>Under the bleachers, in the showers</i>
<i>While we're changing for gym class</i>

923
01:15:57,029 --> 01:15:58,860
- <i>I'm fucking Oprah</i>
- <i>I'm fucking Obama</i>

924
01:15:59,064 --> 01:16:01,157
<i>I'm fucking Indiana's ass</i>

925
01:16:01,366 --> 01:16:05,325
<i>She's fucking Indiana</i>
<i>And I'm fucking Hancock</i>

926
01:16:05,537 --> 01:16:09,098
<i>He's fucking Hancock</i>
<i>And I'm fucking Beowulf</i>

927
01:16:09,308 --> 01:16:12,766
<i>You know you like it</i>
<i>And I'm fucking Kung Fu Panda</i>

928
01:16:12,978 --> 01:16:15,469
<i>And I'm fucking Michael Jackson</i>

929
01:16:16,882 --> 01:16:19,908
<i>Don't judge me</i>
<i>I love my animals, you see</i>

930
01:16:20,118 --> 01:16:21,847
<i>Oh, yeah, he's fucking the Chipmunks</i>

931
01:16:22,054 --> 01:16:25,615
<i>Sad to say, but it's true</i>
<i>He fucks the Chipmunks, yeah</i>

932
01:18:51,837 --> 01:18:53,464
You just got Wolfed.

933
01:18:53,672 --> 01:18:56,573
That's a little move I learned in jail.

934
01:18:56,775 --> 01:18:58,174
Yeah, I was in jail.

935
01:18:58,377 --> 01:19:00,937
Wolf wrote some bad checks in '95.

936
01:19:01,146 --> 01:19:03,273
Left foot, yellow.

937
01:19:04,616 --> 01:19:05,981
Oh, that's right, I fall.

938
01:19:11,957 --> 01:19:14,983
Sorry about that. This is mine.
Sorry. I'm sorry.

939
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:19,960
Wait. Oh, this is my jam.

940
01:19:20,165 --> 01:19:22,725
Oh, okay. You get on it.

941
01:19:23,168 --> 01:19:24,430
I am Beowulf.

942
01:19:24,636 --> 01:19:28,231
I'm the strongest man
in seven kingdoms.

943
01:19:30,008 --> 01:19:32,533
Let myself go a little bit.

944
01:19:32,744 --> 01:19:34,609
Got a little bit flabby.

945
01:19:34,813 --> 01:19:36,713
I went on that Zone Diet...

946
01:19:36,915 --> 01:19:41,682
...but I would eat like a whole week's
worth of meals in like two days...

947
01:19:41,887 --> 01:19:43,479
...and then be back to square one.

948
01:19:43,688 --> 01:19:47,715
If you've got crack anywhere,
I don't care where it comes from...

949
01:19:47,926 --> 01:19:51,384
If it's in your crack...
If the crack's in your crack.

950
01:19:52,964 --> 01:19:56,229
"If the crack's in your crack."
Oh, that's rich.

951
01:19:56,601 --> 01:19:58,626
You ever been
with a bald doctor before?

952
01:19:58,837 --> 01:20:00,930
- No.
- We give better...

953
01:20:02,974 --> 01:20:05,101
Do I look like Harrison Ford to you?

954
01:20:05,310 --> 01:20:07,505
- He your pimp?
- Oh, good heavens, yes.

955
01:20:11,316 --> 01:20:13,682
Oh, what to do? Yes, I've got it.

956
01:20:13,885 --> 01:20:17,343
You can be my prince of light,
and you can be my prince of darkness.

957
01:20:17,556 --> 01:20:19,387
- Yes. No? Okay.
- No.

958
01:20:20,325 --> 01:20:22,452
Left foot, yellow.

959
01:20:23,895 --> 01:20:25,658
Look at this onion.

960
01:20:25,864 --> 01:20:29,857
Baby, how did you get into it with him.
You should be with me.

961
01:20:30,068 --> 01:20:33,936
Also, when I make love to a girl,
she's also been Wolfed.

962
01:20:34,139 --> 01:20:39,634
I don't hit her with a stick,
I just have sex with her.

963
01:20:39,845 --> 01:20:41,972
Or him. Doesn't matter.

964
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:44,375
Wolf goes both ways,
you know what I'm saying?

965
01:20:44,583 --> 01:20:47,017
I got us tickets
to Madonna's reunion show...

966
01:20:47,219 --> 01:20:49,414
...and then I wanna
kiss your sweet face.

967
01:20:49,621 --> 01:20:51,350
No!

968
01:20:52,557 --> 01:20:54,650
Take it from the top again.
She says, "Hello."

969
01:20:54,860 --> 01:20:57,658
Don't hit her so hard.
Just hit her really lightly.

970
01:20:57,863 --> 01:20:59,296
Okay?

971
01:20:59,998 --> 01:21:01,397
Good enough for me.

972
01:21:03,135 --> 01:21:04,864
It's all very funny.

973
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:07,137
Cut.

974
01:21:07,806 --> 01:21:11,537
Oh, it's my Blake, incarcerated.
Hi, Blakey.

975
01:21:11,743 --> 01:21:14,143
How are you? I love you.

976
01:21:14,346 --> 01:21:16,177
He did not kill those three prostitutes.

977
01:21:16,381 --> 01:21:20,374
They were already dead when he
got to them. I'm swearing to God.

978
01:21:20,886 --> 01:21:23,912
Look, I have to tell you something.
I'm not really a banker.

979
01:21:24,122 --> 01:21:25,749
As my voice cracks.

980
01:21:25,957 --> 01:21:31,020
Look, I have something to tell you.
I'm not really a banker. I'm a jumper.

981
01:21:31,229 --> 01:21:34,596
I can teleport through space and time.

982
01:21:37,936 --> 01:21:40,302
- What is it again? Time and space.
- Time and space.

983
01:21:40,705 --> 01:21:42,297
Look, I have something to tell you.

984
01:21:42,507 --> 01:21:44,702
I'm not really a banker. I'm a jumper.

985
01:21:44,910 --> 01:21:47,879
- A what?
- I can teleport through time...

986
01:21:54,286 --> 01:21:55,617
You're a talking panda.

987
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:59,347
Come back to my magical kingdom,
and I'll show you my talking beaver.

988
01:21:59,858 --> 01:22:01,758
It just keeps coming.

989
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:05,794
Knock, knock. Who's there?
Milk in your mouth.

990
01:22:11,703 --> 01:22:18,541
Hey, is my singing stick on?
It is on? Is the singing stick on?

991
01:22:21,246 --> 01:22:24,545
You know, everyone wants to know
where I got my:

992
01:22:24,749 --> 01:22:27,809
It all started one night
when I was crying in my truck.

993
01:22:28,019 --> 01:22:30,920
Yeah. I ain't crying no more, man.

994
01:22:31,122 --> 01:22:33,113
Fourteenth highest-rated show on TV.

995
01:22:33,325 --> 01:22:36,226
I got a time-share in Key West.

996
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:41,194
<i>Oh, baby, I make shoes</i>

997
01:22:41,399 --> 01:22:45,267
<i>And these are my boobs</i>

998
01:22:45,470 --> 01:22:47,700
I want you to see me
in my birthday suit.

999
01:22:47,906 --> 01:22:50,136
I want you to watch me
take a bubble bath.

1000
01:22:50,342 --> 01:22:53,209
I'm gonna play around with the bubbles
and make a little beard.

1001
01:22:53,411 --> 01:22:55,345
Pretend I'm Santa Claus.

1002
01:22:56,715 --> 01:22:59,411
Oh, son, I'm loving this.

1003
01:22:59,784 --> 01:23:03,220
Hang on a bit.
You're a bit of stuff, aren't you?

1004
01:23:03,421 --> 01:23:06,481
Look at you.
What are you packing under there?

1005
01:23:06,691 --> 01:23:08,215
What are you hiding under that?

1006
01:23:08,426 --> 01:23:11,293
I can see your sausage and biscuits.

1007
01:23:12,631 --> 01:23:14,155
I love sausage and biscuits.

1008
01:23:27,379 --> 01:23:29,176
Wonderful!

1009
01:23:30,248 --> 01:23:32,341
I'd like to get you naked
and analyze you.

1010
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:34,677
Oh, shit.

1011
01:23:34,886 --> 01:23:37,286
Do you like this shirt?
I totally made it myself.

1012
01:23:37,489 --> 01:23:40,083
Well, it's because I ripped it.
It's because I burned it.

1013
01:23:40,292 --> 01:23:41,987
I was leaning over my birthday candles.

1014
01:23:42,193 --> 01:23:43,922
I was gonna blow them out,
make a wish.

1015
01:23:44,129 --> 01:23:45,756
Instead my shirt caught on fire.

1016
01:23:46,197 --> 01:23:49,894
Son, if you go back for your girlfriend,
you have zero chance of survival.

1017
01:23:50,235 --> 01:23:52,203
I'll take those odds.

1018
01:23:53,405 --> 01:23:55,339
Do you hear that train?

1019
01:23:57,709 --> 01:24:01,440
Son, if you go back for your girlfriend,
you have zero chance of survival.

1020
01:24:01,646 --> 01:24:03,307
I'll take those odds.

1021
01:24:03,515 --> 01:24:06,712
You hear that train again?
You hear that again, that second time?

1022
01:24:07,118 --> 01:24:10,884
Son, if you go back for your girlfriend,
you have zero chance of survival.

1023
01:24:11,323 --> 01:24:12,381
I'll take those...

1024
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:15,058
Train. I knew it was coming too. Yeah.

1025

- Is that the train we should catch?
- No, no. Take a...

1026
01:24:21,766 --> 01:24:22,755

1027
01:24:22,967 --> 01:24:25,834

to always use Proactiv. It helped me.

1029
01:24:32,243 --> 01:24:36,907

<i>It helped my skin</i>

1030
01:24:37,115 --> 01:24:42,781
<i>It helped my skin</i>
<i>It helped my skin, baby</i>

1031
01:24:42,987 --> 01:24:46,354

01:24:52,230 --> 01:24:54,721

01:24:54,933 --> 01:25:00,064
There's a medical term
