1
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:30,000
What I do requires
a certain mindset.

2
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:33,768
I do assignments,

3
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:36,600
designated targets.

4
00:06:38,845 --> 00:06:41,075
Some jobs need to look
like accidents.

5
00:06:43,616 --> 00:06:46,676
Others must cast suspicion
on someone else.

6
00:06:51,691 --> 00:06:54,785
A select few need to send
a clear message.

7
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:00,423
Pulling a trigger is easy.

8
00:07:02,802 --> 00:07:06,898
The best jobs are the ones nobody
even knows you were there.

9
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:37,602
Liquor fairy paid me
a visit last night.

10
00:07:38,638 --> 00:07:40,902
Left me a big old bottle of Scotch.

11
00:07:41,074 --> 00:07:43,838
He even sprung for the good stuff.

12
00:07:46,513 --> 00:07:48,003
See you, Henry.

13
00:08:15,341 --> 00:08:19,209
Why the fuck do I let you drag
me out to this shit hole?

14
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,438
You're a snob, Harry.

15
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:24,548
Eleven hundred people come
through here every day.

16
00:08:24,717 --> 00:08:27,117
Hard to remember two fellows
passing through.

17
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:28,345
Thank you.

18
00:08:30,056 --> 00:08:32,024
Of course, people might
remember them.

19
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:35,789
Yeah.

20
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:37,953
Then that kind of defeats
your purpose.

21
00:08:38,131 --> 00:08:40,395
I don't go anywhere without
them. Nowhere.

22
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:43,900
Try to get them shoes that fit.
They look like cartoons.

23
00:08:45,071 --> 00:08:46,368
Everything went okay?

24
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:49,531
It got done.

25
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:53,336
There's no one better
than you, you know.

26
00:08:54,314 --> 00:08:57,010
That's why they give you those
jobs that could get hairy

27
00:08:57,183 --> 00:09:00,516
because if they were to get hairy,
then you would take care of it,

28
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:04,418
and that's all they care about,
services rendered, no loose ends.

29
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:06,855
Fait accompli.

30
00:09:07,026 --> 00:09:08,857
You're a goddamn machine.

31
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:11,528
You see things.

32
00:09:11,698 --> 00:09:16,067
You view people differently than I
do, differently than anybody does.

33
00:09:16,236 --> 00:09:18,602
Yeah, but you've got
a problem, Arthur.

34
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:20,704
You need companionship.

35
00:09:20,874 --> 00:09:22,364
I have you, Harry.

36
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:24,567
Oh, then you're in deeper
shit than I thought.

37
00:09:26,746 --> 00:09:28,304
So how's Steven?

38
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:32,110
Did I tell you that I got him a
job at a private security firm?

39
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:35,948
They kicked him out last month.
He beat some guy half to death.

40
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:41,925
Goddamn disappointment.

41
00:09:42,095 --> 00:09:44,086
Always has been, always will be.

42
00:09:46,532 --> 00:09:47,863
Call him.

43
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:49,661
Me? Call him?

44
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:50,860
For what?

45
00:09:51,037 --> 00:09:53,528
He probably needs to hear from you.

46
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:56,803
Yeah.

47
00:09:56,976 --> 00:09:58,967
Let's go. I'll get your money.

48
00:10:46,592 --> 00:10:47,957
Come on. Dance with me.

49
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:51,829
Come on, please?

50
00:11:30,903 --> 00:11:32,495
You hungry?

51
00:11:34,173 --> 00:11:35,640
Sure.

52
00:11:51,057 --> 00:11:52,786
I gotta go.

53
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,418
Okay.

54
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:11,736
You ever gonna tell me your name?

55
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:17,940
Arthur.

56
00:12:19,952 --> 00:12:21,579
Nice try.

57
00:12:21,754 --> 00:12:23,085
But you're no Arthur.

58
00:12:23,523 --> 00:12:27,186
No, more like a David.

59
00:12:27,727 --> 00:12:29,786
Or Brad. Hmm.

60
00:12:31,264 --> 00:12:32,492
Yeah.

61
00:12:32,665 --> 00:12:34,428
See you, Brad.

62
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:41,969
Yeah, I know. MAN 2: Whoo!

63
00:12:42,141 --> 00:12:43,870
Yeah.

64
00:13:18,878 --> 00:13:19,970
Global Engineering.

65
00:13:20,146 --> 00:13:22,273
I'm calling about the ad.

66
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:23,676
There must be a mistake.

67
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,909
One moment, please.

68
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:31,555
The advertisement was proofed.
The information is accurate.

69
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:33,989
I want a meeting.

70
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:36,627
We'll get back to you.

71
00:13:43,803 --> 00:13:46,135
Mr. Bishop, Mr. Dean has
agreed to a meeting.

72
00:13:46,305 --> 00:13:48,364
A private jet will pick
you up in one hour

73
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,634
and deliver you to a site
of his choosing.

74
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:54,576
You'll be allowed 15 minutes.
The jet will then return you.

75
00:13:54,981 --> 00:13:58,849
When we tell you to be home at
10:00, we mean 10, not 11 :30.

76
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:01,652
I don't care, baby. You scared
your mother to death.

77
00:14:01,821 --> 00:14:05,222
You're grounded for two
weeks. Just one second.

78
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:09,285
Well, that's not my problem.

79
00:14:10,563 --> 00:14:11,587
All right, look.

80
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:14,324
Ten days and you volunteer two
Saturdays at the shelter.

81
00:14:15,368 --> 00:14:17,700
Eight days and three Saturdays.

82
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,065
Done.

83
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:21,706
Where do I get one of those?

84
00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:24,866
You can't. Unless you're
a world champion.

85
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:27,239
Just tell him to come
out and fix it, honey.

86
00:14:27,413 --> 00:14:28,903
All right, let's go.

87
00:14:32,852 --> 00:14:36,185
I've just been out-negotiated
by a 16 year old.

88
00:14:37,323 --> 00:14:39,018
Let's take a walk.

89
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:45,589
Six months ago, we were commissioned
to undertake

90
00:14:45,765 --> 00:14:47,995
the largest contract we've
ever attempted.

91
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:51,200
The target was far more high-profile
than we're normally

92
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,126
comfortable with

93
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:54,330
but the job was just
too rich to pass up.

94
00:14:54,507 --> 00:14:57,442
The target was South African? The
target fled to South Africa.

95
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,942
That's where we made our
move, in Cape Town.

96
00:15:00,112 --> 00:15:02,103
It took six months to set up.

97
00:15:02,281 --> 00:15:06,377
I assigned a team of five operatives
to work in concert on the mission.

98
00:15:06,552 --> 00:15:07,712
All five were killed.

99
00:15:08,554 --> 00:15:10,681
Someone knew everything.

100
00:15:11,123 --> 00:15:13,648
You probably knew some of
the men on that team.

101
00:15:13,826 --> 00:15:16,294
I knew this one. Sebastian.

102
00:15:17,897 --> 00:15:20,525
You know how this company
works, Mr. Bishop.

103
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,500
Only two partners know the
details of any given job.

104
00:15:25,438 --> 00:15:27,235
Two people knew the details here.

105
00:15:27,406 --> 00:15:30,204
Me and Harry McKenna.

106
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,135
Harry sold us out.

107
00:15:36,315 --> 00:15:37,805
We pulled his financials.

108
00:15:37,984 --> 00:15:40,544
Take a look at recent
offshore deposits.

109
00:15:41,921 --> 00:15:44,890
There's one there made two weeks
ago for 20 million U.S. dollars.

110
00:15:45,992 --> 00:15:47,152
He's gotten old.

111
00:15:47,326 --> 00:15:48,759
He's gotten weak.

112
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:52,625
He's loaded with debts, his divorce,
his costly, troubled son.

113
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:54,962
They made him vulnerable.

114
00:15:55,501 --> 00:15:58,834
And for the past 13 years, I have
been fiercely loyal to him.

115
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:01,200
There's no one I respected more.

116
00:16:01,374 --> 00:16:03,842
But Harry McKenna has
poisoned the well.

117
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,138
He needs to be removed.
Immediately.

118
00:16:07,313 --> 00:16:08,837
Let me talk to him.

119
00:16:09,315 --> 00:16:12,307
Look, I appreciate your
connection with Harry,

120
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:14,783
but there's no turning back here.

121
00:16:15,354 --> 00:16:17,948
He has crossed his Rubicon.

122
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:21,890
Every day that he's alive puts
this company in danger.

123
00:16:23,062 --> 00:16:26,156
I know we would all prefer
that you handle this.

124
00:16:26,332 --> 00:16:27,697
Given your relationship,

125
00:16:27,867 --> 00:16:31,359
you're in the best position to get
this done quickly and discreetly.

126
00:16:31,537 --> 00:16:34,400
And to be honest with you,
I hate the idea of Harry

127
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,769
suffering unnecessarily.

128
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,438
We don't wanna go to
an outside source.

129
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:40,135
But we will if we have to.

130
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:44,110
Excuse me a sec.

131
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:50,416
Jess, negotiations are
closed. I'm sorry.

132
00:16:50,756 --> 00:16:53,657
I'm in a meeting. Okay,
hang on a sec.

133
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:59,925
Forty-eight hours or we'll
proceed without you.

134
00:17:01,901 --> 00:17:02,925
Hey, squirt?

135
00:17:03,102 --> 00:17:06,731
Remember the expression, "Quit
while you're ahead"?

136
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:15,474
Yeah, I mean, Roosevelt, to
be truthful, is my hero.

137
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:18,748
I mean, the way he dealt
with his damn chair.

138
00:17:18,918 --> 00:17:21,853
Jasper, pull your trousers
up, will you? Please?

139
00:17:22,021 --> 00:17:23,545
Pull your trousers up.

140
00:17:23,723 --> 00:17:26,817
You know, the suits don't really
fit you guys very well.

141
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:26,409
Yeah? Get
out of the building, Harry.

142
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:29,817
Arthur? They're coming
for you tonight.

143
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:31,718
Who? Who's coming?

144
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:32,983
Dean.

145
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:36,628
Take whatever you can use
against them and get out.

146
00:18:36,796 --> 00:18:37,922
Oh, Jesus.

147
00:18:38,097 --> 00:18:39,894
Do you have a pair of scissors?

148
00:18:40,065 --> 00:18:41,327
Yeah.

149
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,765
Go to the elevator
lobby. On my way.

150
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,446
Looks like we got a power outage
on the 1 8th floor.

151
00:18:57,616 --> 00:18:59,709
You have 15 seconds
to get to the elevator

152
00:18:59,885 --> 00:19:01,716
before the emergency
power comes on.

153
00:19:01,887 --> 00:19:04,151
There's a keypad. Punch
in the building number.

154
00:19:04,323 --> 00:19:05,449
We cut the power off.

155
00:19:05,624 --> 00:19:08,889
Service elevators have to work
on a separate power source.

156
00:19:09,528 --> 00:19:11,120
I'm in.

157
00:19:11,297 --> 00:19:12,696
Press the basement floor.

158
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:15,690
The elevator will take 18
seconds to get there.

159
00:19:16,335 --> 00:19:19,133
The level is empty and
unused. Take the ramp.

160
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:23,760
It connects to the building
next door. It leads to an

161
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,438
underground parking lot.

162
00:19:26,345 --> 00:19:28,074
Shit.

163
00:19:29,215 --> 00:19:32,320
Security cameras haven't been
fitted in this building

164
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,811
yet, so they'll be blind.

165
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:43,093
Okay, you should be entering
the parking lot now.

166
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,305
My van's here.

167
00:19:56,775 --> 00:19:58,834
I left it there.

168
00:19:59,545 --> 00:20:01,979
Oh, shit.

169
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:13,887
Well, you got me to circumvent
my own security.

170
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,660
Nobody sees me leave.

171
00:20:19,598 --> 00:20:21,623
So, what's this?

172
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,097
Cape Town, right?

173
00:20:23,702 --> 00:20:26,034
Yeah. Right.

174
00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:32,573
So, what's the story here?

175
00:20:32,745 --> 00:20:34,474
Carjacking?

176
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:38,000
Police will find my van somewhere
in some shit hole

177
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,380
section of the city,

178
00:20:39,552 --> 00:20:42,214
stripped and up on blocks?

179
00:20:42,388 --> 00:20:43,946
Something like that.

180
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:50,856
Well, a slight editorial revision.

181
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,964
You don't mind, do you?

182
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:13,285
Yeah, I get off a couple of
shots, there's a struggle,

183
00:21:13,452 --> 00:21:16,910
they get my gun, c'est la vie.

184
00:21:17,723 --> 00:21:21,022
At least I don't go down
looking like a pussy.

185
00:21:23,462 --> 00:21:26,226
I've had that for 33 years.

186
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:31,697
Gift from Admiral Beasley.
Sixth Fleet.

187
00:21:32,738 --> 00:21:34,569
That's the first time I ever fired it.

188
00:21:38,444 --> 00:21:40,071
Why didn't you kill me?

189
00:21:40,913 --> 00:21:42,380
Ah.

190
00:21:42,715 --> 00:21:45,206
They'd just send somebody else.

191
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:49,954
I would rather it was you, Arthur.

192
00:21:52,191 --> 00:21:53,954
You'll have to live with it.

193
00:22:57,723 --> 00:22:59,315
Arthur fucking Bishop.

194
00:22:59,858 --> 00:23:01,553
Sorry for your loss.

195
00:23:02,294 --> 00:23:05,229
More of a loss for you
than me, buddy.

196
00:23:05,397 --> 00:23:07,365
It's a long time.

197
00:23:31,457 --> 00:23:34,426
Hey, would you give me a ride
to my father's house?

198
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:45,727
Your father talked about you a lot.

199
00:23:46,271 --> 00:23:48,933
He talked about spending time
with you, maybe making up.

200
00:23:49,441 --> 00:23:51,375
Give it a rest, would you?

201
00:23:51,543 --> 00:23:54,011
Yeah, well, he was always
bringing you up.

202
00:23:54,613 --> 00:23:55,978
He had regrets, Steven.

203
00:23:56,148 --> 00:23:58,708
Yeah, he could have picked
up the phone anytime.

204
00:24:14,266 --> 00:24:16,291
I wanna show you something.

205
00:24:25,878 --> 00:24:28,346
I loved this place as a kid.

206
00:24:35,621 --> 00:24:37,714
It's pretty impressive, huh?

207
00:24:39,491 --> 00:24:43,120
Every one of them served
their country.

208
00:24:44,396 --> 00:24:47,092
I guess I could still enlist.

209
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:49,692
You know, make him proud.

210
00:24:51,603 --> 00:24:53,264
I'm fucking with you.

211
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:56,030
I don't know if you have
a picture of him,

212
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:58,233
but I thought maybe
you'd, you know,

213
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,934
want one.

214
00:25:10,923 --> 00:25:13,517
Looks like you're not planning
on sticking around.

215
00:25:13,692 --> 00:25:15,125
For what?

216
00:25:15,561 --> 00:25:17,495
He didn't leave a will.

217
00:25:17,663 --> 00:25:20,530
Accounts are empty. Bank's
gonna take the house.

218
00:25:20,933 --> 00:25:24,061
By the time the lawyers, city and
state get through with the rest,

219
00:25:24,236 --> 00:25:26,170
not gonna be a fucking thing left.

220
00:25:26,338 --> 00:25:27,396
Where you headed?

221
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,531
Next place.

222
00:25:33,212 --> 00:25:34,543
Need some money?

223
00:25:34,713 --> 00:25:36,806
No, thanks.

224
00:25:38,016 --> 00:25:41,383
I got a guy coming to the house.
He's gonna look at the car.

225
00:25:41,553 --> 00:25:44,886
I figure that'll probably get me
through along to the next spot.

226
00:25:46,158 --> 00:25:47,386
What about the guns?

227
00:25:51,063 --> 00:25:53,031
I was thinking about going out

228
00:25:53,198 --> 00:25:56,258
and killing myself a couple
carjackers tonight.

229
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:01,268
Just any old run-of-the-mill
carjacker.

230
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,702
Yeah, well, you never know.

231
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:05,571
I might get lucky, find the
guys that killed my dad.

232
00:26:05,744 --> 00:26:07,712
It gonna make you feel better?

233
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,982
Fuck if I know.

234
00:26:12,584 --> 00:26:14,381
But I'll find out.

235
00:26:24,963 --> 00:26:26,954
Sleep it off, Steve.

236
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,135
Hey, Bishop?

237
00:26:34,406 --> 00:26:37,807
What kind of person shoots someone
in a wheelchair, anyway?

238
00:27:29,828 --> 00:27:31,455
How long am I
supposed to wait?

239
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:34,394
You know what? You
can wait until tomorrow.

240
00:27:34,566 --> 00:27:37,057
Look, I told you to be here.

241
00:27:38,337 --> 00:27:39,702
Yo.

242
00:27:44,142 --> 00:27:46,804
Hey. Hey, you need some help?

243
00:27:49,781 --> 00:27:52,682
No, I think I got it. Mm. Mm.

244
00:27:53,652 --> 00:27:56,880
I'm supposed to meet a friend
and I might have gotten

245
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,055
the address wrong.

246
00:27:58,223 --> 00:28:00,214
Yeah. Maybe.

247
00:28:00,392 --> 00:28:02,860
Well, maybe the address
got me wrong.

248
00:28:06,298 --> 00:28:08,357
Nice car, man. Nice car.

249
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:10,023
Thanks.

250
00:28:11,336 --> 00:28:14,203
Can I have it? What?

251
00:28:14,373 --> 00:28:17,740
I'm relieving you of your
automobile, motherfucker.

252
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:19,536
Out of the car.

253
00:28:19,711 --> 00:28:21,542
Seriously? Seriously.

254
00:28:23,382 --> 00:28:25,748
Jesus fucking Chri-- Okay.

255
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:27,407
Okay.

256
00:28:27,586 --> 00:28:29,178
Mother--

257
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:35,517
Carjacker.

258
00:28:39,297 --> 00:28:40,525
Did you shoot him with this?

259
00:28:42,234 --> 00:28:44,532
Fuck. Is this
the gun you used?

260
00:28:45,337 --> 00:28:46,668
No?

261
00:29:19,438 --> 00:29:21,269
Hey. Bad move.

262
00:29:23,408 --> 00:29:26,036
Didn't properly think this
through, did you, Steven?

263
00:29:29,314 --> 00:29:34,911
This may not seem like it, but
tonight's your lucky night, Raymond.

264
00:29:37,222 --> 00:29:38,814
Anybody asks, you fell down.

265
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,821
Don't make us come looking for you.

266
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,755
Get out of here.

267
00:29:45,864 --> 00:29:48,264
Stupid to kill someone when
you have a motive.

268
00:29:48,433 --> 00:29:51,095
Might as well paint a bull's-eye
on your back.

269
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:52,930
I don't give a shit.

270
00:29:53,105 --> 00:29:54,970
I'm aware.

271
00:29:56,975 --> 00:29:58,772
Get out of here.

272
00:30:51,897 --> 00:30:54,923
I was thinking about what you
were saying the other night.

273
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,831
And I wanna know what you know.

274
00:30:59,437 --> 00:31:01,132
Go online.

275
00:31:01,306 --> 00:31:03,297
It's all on the Internet.

276
00:31:04,142 --> 00:31:06,133
But I don't wanna read it.

277
00:31:06,311 --> 00:31:08,074
I wanna do it.

278
00:31:08,713 --> 00:31:10,340
Do what exactly?

279
00:31:10,515 --> 00:31:12,540
Bishop, don't bullshit me.

280
00:31:12,717 --> 00:31:14,184
I know about you.

281
00:31:15,053 --> 00:31:16,247
And him.

282
00:31:16,421 --> 00:31:19,049
He was your mentor. He
chose you over me.

283
00:31:19,224 --> 00:31:21,192
You owe him.

284
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:25,295
Now that he's gone, he's left me with
fucking nothing. You owe me now.

285
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:28,696
Go home, Steve.

286
00:31:54,926 --> 00:31:56,416
Still for sale.

287
00:31:57,529 --> 00:31:59,190
You know you want it.

288
00:31:59,364 --> 00:32:02,356
No other lifetime but this.

289
00:32:03,134 --> 00:32:05,102
Want some advice?

290
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:08,130
Follow what this tells you.

291
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,906
It's trying to tell you something.

292
00:32:11,643 --> 00:32:15,909
It's telling you you're homesick
for a place you've never been.

293
00:32:48,413 --> 00:32:51,644
8600 Alvarado
Street, 7 a.m. tomorrow.

294
00:33:08,466 --> 00:33:09,490
What is this place?

295
00:33:09,668 --> 00:33:10,794
It's an animal shelter.

296
00:33:10,969 --> 00:33:12,834
Yeah, I know what it
is. Why are we here?

297
00:33:13,004 --> 00:33:15,802
Look for a dog like this. Under
a year, if possible.

298
00:33:15,974 --> 00:33:18,636
I would have taken you
more for a cat person.

299
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,178
You know what a mechanic is, outside
its obvious definition?

300
00:33:25,884 --> 00:33:29,843
A guy who fixes things,
problems, has contracts.

301
00:33:30,422 --> 00:33:31,684
A hit man.

302
00:33:31,856 --> 00:33:33,483
I do assignments.

303
00:33:33,658 --> 00:33:35,216
Designated targets.

304
00:33:35,393 --> 00:33:37,122
I could do that.

305
00:33:37,595 --> 00:33:39,654
I've seen some shit.
No, you haven't.

306
00:33:41,866 --> 00:33:44,232
You know shit about me, Bishop.

307
00:33:44,903 --> 00:33:48,168
Steven Jackson McKenna. Born
in Baltimore, Maryland.

308
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:51,537
Your mother died when you was 12.
A mixture of pain meds and vodka.

309
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,610
You attended three different
high schools.

310
00:33:53,778 --> 00:33:55,075
Grant, Deer Park and Monroe.

311
00:33:55,246 --> 00:33:57,806
Lettered in four sports, got
a scholarship from Miami

312
00:33:57,982 --> 00:34:00,200
that was rescinded upon a
conviction of possession with

313
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,110
intent to distribute.

314
00:34:01,286 --> 00:34:04,187
Had misdemeanors for aggravated
assault and unlawful threats

315
00:34:04,356 --> 00:34:06,085
against two different girlfriends.

316
00:34:06,257 --> 00:34:07,656
Broke your kneecap in a fight.

317
00:34:07,826 --> 00:34:09,885
Didn't wanna tell anyone, so
you let it heal on its own.

318
00:34:10,061 --> 00:34:11,926
Now, when it rains, you
walk with a limp.

319
00:34:12,097 --> 00:34:14,691
I'll show you the x-rays, if you like.

320
00:34:19,904 --> 00:34:23,670
Our friend here would like to
adopt this little fellow.

321
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:26,838
Hello, boy.

322
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:40,051
What I do requires
a certain mindset.

323
00:34:40,225 --> 00:34:42,420
Revenge is an emotion that
can get you killed.

324
00:34:42,594 --> 00:34:45,358
So no more stupid stunts
like the other night.

325
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:54,202
Walk it, feed it, make
it your best friend.

326
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,472
Tomorrow, 11, Fischer Square.

327
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:14,958
Take the dog to the
coffee shop on Riverdale.

328
00:35:15,493 --> 00:35:17,723
Order a coffee. Black.

329
00:35:17,896 --> 00:35:21,423
Sit at a table by the window and do
the Sudoku puzzle in the paper.

330
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,159
Play nice with the
dog. For how long?

331
00:35:24,335 --> 00:35:26,030
One hour.

332
00:35:26,204 --> 00:35:28,172
Every day for the next three weeks.

333
00:35:51,663 --> 00:35:54,632
This is yours. This is
yours. This is yours.

334
00:36:08,947 --> 00:36:10,209
Practice on this.

335
00:36:12,317 --> 00:36:15,411
Insurance companies know everything
about how people die.

336
00:36:15,587 --> 00:36:17,680
They even have books
with actuaries,

337
00:36:17,856 --> 00:36:20,791
lists of every cause
of death imaginable.

338
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:23,223
Why don't you just shoot
them and fuck all this?

339
00:36:23,394 --> 00:36:25,123
Good judgment comes from experience

340
00:36:25,296 --> 00:36:28,094
and a lot of that comes
from bad judgment.

341
00:36:44,749 --> 00:36:46,910
Bed's under the boxes.

342
00:36:47,085 --> 00:36:48,848
Help yourself.

343
00:37:16,514 --> 00:37:18,482
How long you been working on it?

344
00:37:20,818 --> 00:37:22,683
Two years.

345
00:37:22,854 --> 00:37:24,685
It's nice.

346
00:37:25,023 --> 00:37:26,786
When are we gonna go for a ride?

347
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:28,717
We?

348
00:37:28,893 --> 00:37:30,190
Never.

349
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:34,957
Time to take your training
to the next level.

350
00:37:56,955 --> 00:37:59,788
Who's that? He's good.

351
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:01,619
Nobody checked you out.

352
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,157
I could come back.

353
00:38:04,562 --> 00:38:06,587
I'd rather not stand out here.

354
00:38:15,873 --> 00:38:18,899
I gotta tell you, man. I'm a
little skittish right now.

355
00:38:19,077 --> 00:38:22,308
Not sure if this is a good time
for me to be doing anything.

356
00:38:23,081 --> 00:38:25,743
There's a lot of shit in
the wind, you know?

357
00:38:27,085 --> 00:38:29,280
I brought the list and the money.

358
00:38:30,722 --> 00:38:32,189
Now's not a good time.

359
00:38:34,292 --> 00:38:36,089
Let me see the list.

360
00:38:41,132 --> 00:38:42,429
All this by when?

361
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,158
As soon as possible.

362
00:38:44,602 --> 00:38:46,365
All right.

363
00:38:46,537 --> 00:38:48,437
Take me a day to make it happen.

364
00:38:49,374 --> 00:38:51,103
Let me have the money.

365
00:39:31,182 --> 00:39:34,709
Autoerotic asphyxiation? Yep.

366
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:42,023
Just thought you should
see one up close.

367
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:07,442
Don't ever touch this.

368
00:40:26,804 --> 00:40:28,328
Follow me.

369
00:40:38,816 --> 00:40:41,250
Who was he? BISHOP: A job.

370
00:40:41,419 --> 00:40:43,387
Nothing more, nothing less.

371
00:40:43,554 --> 00:40:46,148
Makes you feel better, he was
an illegal arms dealer.

372
00:40:47,158 --> 00:40:51,993
Sold weapons to anyone. Cop killers,
gangbangers, terrorists.

373
00:40:52,663 --> 00:40:54,722
He didn't discriminate.

374
00:41:05,476 --> 00:41:07,000
Here's the file.

375
00:41:10,047 --> 00:41:11,514
The guy from
the coffee shop?

376
00:41:13,785 --> 00:41:15,252
All yours.

377
00:41:16,087 --> 00:41:17,952
You wouldn't know
it by looking at him,

378
00:41:18,122 --> 00:41:20,249
but he's a mechanic
for another group.

379
00:41:21,459 --> 00:41:24,394
His only routine is coffee every
morning from 9 to 10.

380
00:41:24,562 --> 00:41:27,122
Doesn't go anyplace
twice except here.

381
00:41:28,466 --> 00:41:30,525
He's insulated, protected.

382
00:41:30,701 --> 00:41:32,464
No way in without him
seeing us coming.

383
00:41:32,637 --> 00:41:35,697
Except he has two weaknesses.
Chihuahuas--

384
00:41:35,873 --> 00:41:37,170
Mind if I sit down? Please.

385
00:41:37,341 --> 00:41:40,174
--and boys. Young boys.

386
00:41:40,344 --> 00:41:42,005
Coffee, black. Thank you.

387
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,670
No doubt he's
checked you out

388
00:41:43,848 --> 00:41:46,112
and found no connection
to you and this world.

389
00:41:46,284 --> 00:41:48,775
What he sees is a good-looking
kid who's kind of lost.

390
00:41:48,953 --> 00:41:51,649
Do you wanna hold him? Yeah.

391
00:41:51,823 --> 00:41:54,257
He likes that.
Come here, baby.

392
00:41:54,425 --> 00:41:58,020
If he's interested, the first
thing he'll do is ask you.

393
00:41:58,196 --> 00:42:00,858
So, you live around here, Steve?
- Your answer should be--

394
00:42:01,032 --> 00:42:02,329
I'm bouncing around.

395
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,900
Which means you're broke
and open to suggestions.

396
00:42:05,069 --> 00:42:07,037
He's my buddy. Yeah.

397
00:42:07,205 --> 00:42:08,229
Then ask you if--

398
00:42:08,406 --> 00:42:10,135
You wanna get a drink one evening?

399
00:42:10,308 --> 00:42:13,038
Your answer
should be-- Yeah.

400
00:42:14,145 --> 00:42:15,407
Great.

401
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:19,038
That's great, isn't
it? Flunitrazepam.

402
00:42:19,217 --> 00:42:20,650
Roofie.

403
00:42:21,385 --> 00:42:24,513
You want me to kill him,
not rape him, right?

404
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:29,993
Two to three drops, he's woozy.

405
00:42:30,428 --> 00:42:33,864
Over six, his heart stops and he's
brain dead in under three minutes.

406
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,693
Do it in the bar. Make it clean.

407
00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:47,737
These fancy places, they always
water down the booze.

408
00:42:47,912 --> 00:42:51,313
So I think that's why these
are going down so fast.

409
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:54,341
They don't water down wine,
that's for sure.

410
00:42:54,518 --> 00:42:55,542
It's really good.

411
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,880
Want another one? Yeah.

412
00:42:57,054 --> 00:42:59,147
Jameson, right? Jameson,
double, please.

413
00:42:59,323 --> 00:43:00,551
Right.

414
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:11,600
Don't mess around
with this guy. Do it in

415
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,734
the bar, make it clean.

416
00:43:16,274 --> 00:43:19,835
I wanna know what
you know. I wanna do it.

417
00:43:32,323 --> 00:43:33,483
What?

418
00:43:33,658 --> 00:43:35,489
What's funny? No, nothing's funny.

419
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:38,823
I'm just, I think I've had
too many. No, come on.

420
00:43:38,996 --> 00:43:40,930
No, I think I'm gonna
finish this one--

421
00:43:41,098 --> 00:43:43,464
I'm gonna finish this one
and then I'm gonna--

422
00:43:45,903 --> 00:43:49,896
I really should go to bed. But
it was very-- It was fun.

423
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:00,447
Steve.

424
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,185
Hey.

425
00:44:04,422 --> 00:44:06,253
You all right? Yeah.

426
00:44:06,424 --> 00:44:08,915
How are you? I'm good, man.

427
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,058
Hey, can I give you
a ride someplace?

428
00:44:12,596 --> 00:44:14,063
Car's right here.

429
00:44:14,699 --> 00:44:16,257
Come on, get in.

430
00:44:16,434 --> 00:44:18,595
I wanna show you something. Yeah?

431
00:44:18,769 --> 00:44:20,760
He's 6'7, 300
pounds and lethal.

432
00:44:21,472 --> 00:44:23,372
Do not take this guy on.

433
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:26,510
And whatever you do, don't
ever get into his car.

434
00:44:44,195 --> 00:44:45,662
What do you think?

435
00:44:46,864 --> 00:44:48,161
It's beautiful.

436
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:50,226
Let me get you a drink.

437
00:44:55,006 --> 00:44:56,234
You paint?

438
00:44:56,407 --> 00:44:58,466
Yeah, it's more of a hobby, really.

439
00:44:58,642 --> 00:45:00,735
Pretty serious hobby.

440
00:45:04,482 --> 00:45:05,813
Cheers.

441
00:45:07,284 --> 00:45:09,514
That's the sitting area,
the fireplace.

442
00:45:09,687 --> 00:45:11,348
Chillaxing room. Heh-heh.

443
00:45:11,522 --> 00:45:14,980
This is the place I'm most
proud of, right here.

444
00:45:15,826 --> 00:45:17,691
Who's this guy?

445
00:45:17,928 --> 00:45:20,829
That is 1 4th century Buddha.

446
00:45:20,998 --> 00:45:24,832
And that was a bitch to
get into this country.

447
00:45:25,002 --> 00:45:27,800
It's nice to have friends,
you know, good friends

448
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,200
that make a difference.

449
00:45:32,143 --> 00:45:33,940
You got food friends?

450
00:45:37,381 --> 00:45:39,542
I mean, really good friends.

451
00:45:44,121 --> 00:45:45,952
You're shaking like a leaf.

452
00:45:46,123 --> 00:45:47,556
Sit down.

453
00:46:04,942 --> 00:46:07,137
All right, all right.

454
00:46:07,311 --> 00:46:09,040
Okay, let me do it.

455
00:46:09,213 --> 00:46:10,441
Slow down, cowboy.

456
00:48:53,077 --> 00:48:55,136
I told you to make it clean.

457
00:49:46,463 --> 00:49:48,226
See you later.

458
00:50:09,586 --> 00:50:11,645
Was it work or pleasure?

459
00:50:15,793 --> 00:50:18,057
I wish someone would
hurt me like that.

460
00:51:06,944 --> 00:51:08,343
Hey.

461
00:51:09,213 --> 00:51:10,737
Thanks.

462
00:51:11,048 --> 00:51:13,016
I'm gonna call him Arthur.

463
00:52:01,799 --> 00:52:02,823
Yeah.

464
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,834
You used an outside individual
to complete your assignment.

465
00:52:07,004 --> 00:52:08,733
That's a violation of
our arrangement.

466
00:52:08,906 --> 00:52:11,466
My arrangement was with Harry.

467
00:52:11,642 --> 00:52:13,234
You and I don't have one.

468
00:52:13,944 --> 00:52:15,912
Just the price.

469
00:52:18,081 --> 00:52:20,743
Or think someone trained by me
would be valuable to you.

470
00:52:20,918 --> 00:52:25,321
Harry McKenna's son? Does he
know you killed his father?

471
00:52:28,158 --> 00:52:30,285
This job needs to be
done immediately.

472
00:52:30,461 --> 00:52:32,952
The client's willing to
pay a premium for it.

473
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:35,291
I don't think so. It's too quick.

474
00:52:35,466 --> 00:52:39,994
Your behavior is making me and
the others extremely uneasy.

475
00:52:40,437 --> 00:52:42,962
You're on a short leash
with this one.

476
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,870
The file is a priority.

477
00:52:50,214 --> 00:52:52,273
I'll look it over.

478
00:53:22,179 --> 00:53:26,946
I am one with God. God touches
me and I touch his people.

479
00:53:27,117 --> 00:53:31,713
Andrew Vaughn, 45 years old, calls
himself The New Messiah.

480
00:53:31,889 --> 00:53:33,254
So, Reverend Vaughn--

481
00:53:33,423 --> 00:53:34,720
Just Vaughn.

482
00:53:34,892 --> 00:53:37,952
I'm not a reverend. I'm not endorsed
by any of the world religions.

483
00:53:38,128 --> 00:53:40,119
I am above them. I am Vaughn.

484
00:53:40,297 --> 00:53:42,959
He has made millions of dollars
through his churches

485
00:53:43,133 --> 00:53:45,294
his ministries, his television
programs.

486
00:53:45,469 --> 00:53:48,029
Basically, he is running a cult.

487
00:53:48,205 --> 00:53:50,640
Adrenalin shot to the heart,
12 cc's, and he's dead

488
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,766
in under three minutes.

489
00:53:51,942 --> 00:53:55,070
Adrenalin's unreliable. One in
four survive cardiac arrest.

490
00:53:55,245 --> 00:53:56,872
But when the EMTs arrive,

491
00:53:57,047 --> 00:54:00,175
the first thing they do is jam you
with a shot of epinephrine.

492
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:03,444
Which is toxic when combined
with-- Adrenaline.

493
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:06,180
So in the off chance our
shot doesn't kill him--

494
00:54:06,356 --> 00:54:08,191
The EMTs will.

495
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:17,530
He left a Bible study group
with a young devotee one night.

496
00:54:17,701 --> 00:54:20,966
They didn't find her body
until two weeks later.

497
00:54:23,774 --> 00:54:26,800
The autopsy said she had an
abortion and was telling

498
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,211
her friends it was his.

499
00:54:28,378 --> 00:54:31,245
Cost him $22 million to hush it up.

500
00:54:32,082 --> 00:54:33,947
Okay, let's get this over with.

501
00:54:38,488 --> 00:54:39,955
Bless you. Next.

502
00:54:41,825 --> 00:54:44,055
Why don't you come sit right here?

503
00:54:46,229 --> 00:54:47,253
You're new here.

504
00:54:47,431 --> 00:54:49,160
How long you been here? Two weeks.

505
00:54:49,333 --> 00:54:51,733
How old are you? Eighteen.

506
00:54:51,902 --> 00:54:53,733
Eighteen.

507
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:26,435
You could have found us someone
more attractive to spy on.

508
00:55:26,903 --> 00:55:28,768
He's still eating.

509
00:55:28,939 --> 00:55:30,770
Soup, salad, sandwich.

510
00:55:30,941 --> 00:55:33,432
Double chocolate cake.

511
00:55:34,244 --> 00:55:35,541
Bishop, I'm hungry.

512
00:55:38,682 --> 00:55:44,120
The guy at the deli, he had Band-Aids
on all of his fingers.

513
00:55:44,655 --> 00:55:47,954
If you find a Band-Aid in your
sandwich, it wasn't mine.

514
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:34,594
We're all clear.

515
00:56:55,225 --> 00:56:57,716
How do you feel, Vaughn?
How do you think I feel?

516
00:56:57,894 --> 00:56:59,361
Where's Frank? I sent for him.

517
00:56:59,529 --> 00:57:00,928
He should be here any minute.

518
00:57:02,466 --> 00:57:03,626
Speak of the devil.

519
00:57:19,616 --> 00:57:21,311
Give me something special today.

520
00:57:21,485 --> 00:57:23,510
I feel like celebrating.

521
00:57:27,324 --> 00:57:29,724
I have the spirits' work to do.

522
00:57:29,893 --> 00:57:31,258
The spirits are gonna
work in your favor.

523
00:57:31,428 --> 00:57:32,452
Hmm.

524
00:57:45,008 --> 00:57:46,032
The guy's a junkie.

525
00:57:47,444 --> 00:57:48,877
He's giving him ketamine.

526
00:57:50,514 --> 00:57:53,210
So? Ketamine counteracts
adrenaline.

527
00:57:53,383 --> 00:57:54,645
This won't work now.

528
00:58:07,397 --> 00:58:11,458
I have been
tapped on the shoulder by God.

529
00:58:12,736 --> 00:58:14,499
What do you wanna do?

530
00:58:16,406 --> 00:58:17,896
I did not ask for this,

531
00:58:19,276 --> 00:58:23,144
but my shoulder was touched
by the sword of the king.

532
00:58:23,313 --> 00:58:28,012
And he told me to rise up.

533
00:58:29,586 --> 00:58:30,814
We've gotta pack it up.

534
00:58:31,721 --> 00:58:34,349
Wait, wait. If he comes
back in here--

535
00:58:35,692 --> 00:58:36,784
We'll be gone soon.

536
00:58:39,196 --> 00:58:41,061
Yes, hello.

537
00:58:41,231 --> 00:58:42,459
Yes, yes, it is.

538
00:58:42,632 --> 00:58:44,862
In the king's name.

539
00:58:45,035 --> 00:58:46,696
Get the scope.

540
00:58:47,304 --> 00:58:48,669
Put it down his throat.

541
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:50,204
Down his throat.

542
00:58:50,373 --> 00:58:52,068
This will choke him.

543
00:58:56,112 --> 00:58:58,637
If they think that I'm going
to pay full price

544
00:58:58,815 --> 00:59:01,215
for a four-bedroom in this
market, they're crazy.

545
00:59:01,384 --> 00:59:04,842
Only I can tie others.

546
00:59:05,922 --> 00:59:07,753
How can I change the world?

547
00:59:08,725 --> 00:59:13,185
How can I be a better man
for my parishioners,

548
00:59:13,363 --> 00:59:15,797
for my flock? Let's go.

549
00:59:15,966 --> 00:59:17,991
Sometimes I wonder.

550
00:59:20,036 --> 00:59:22,061
Sometimes I wonder

551
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:26,369
if I have the strength,
the courage.

552
00:59:26,543 --> 00:59:31,810
I look at myself in the
mirror and think...

553
00:59:34,718 --> 00:59:37,346
And then I... Christ.

554
00:59:38,255 --> 00:59:41,122
Ralph, get in here.
- What is it?

555
00:59:41,291 --> 00:59:42,690
What is it?

556
00:59:45,195 --> 00:59:47,060
Is he dead? DOCTOR:
Yes, he's dead.

557
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:49,198
Motherfucker. I knew this
was gonna happen.

558
00:59:49,366 --> 00:59:50,833
Get all this shit rounded up

559
00:59:51,001 --> 00:59:53,299
and get it out of here
as fast as you can.

560
01:00:05,115 --> 01:00:07,174
Try and pick him up.

561
01:00:11,821 --> 01:00:13,448
Fuck.

562
01:00:28,471 --> 01:00:30,371
Go check it out.

563
01:00:49,626 --> 01:00:50,991
Take it off the wall.

564
01:00:55,465 --> 01:00:56,932
They're in the wall.

565
01:01:03,073 --> 01:01:04,540
Follow them.

566
01:01:05,775 --> 01:01:08,835
Cover the exits and get me
two guys on the roof now.

567
01:01:29,065 --> 01:01:30,555
There he is.

568
01:01:55,125 --> 01:01:56,524
Oh!

569
01:02:07,904 --> 01:02:09,201
Go that way.

570
01:03:12,502 --> 01:03:16,563
Stay calm and exit
through the main door.

571
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:20,337
They're looking for two men. Get a
connecting flight out of Midway,

572
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:23,138
I'll fly out of O'Hare, I'll
meet you at the house.

573
01:03:23,646 --> 01:03:25,045
Right this way. Let's go.

574
01:03:25,215 --> 01:03:27,012
This way, folks.

575
01:03:30,854 --> 01:03:32,755
Yeah. Yeah, right.

576
01:03:33,156 --> 01:03:35,840
Andrew Vaughn, the
controversial and polarizing

577
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:36,751
religious figure,

578
01:03:36,926 --> 01:03:39,087
has been pronounced dead.

579
01:03:39,262 --> 01:03:42,561
Police are investigating the shooting
that occurred shortly thereafter.

580
01:03:42,732 --> 01:03:45,667
The perpetrators have
not been found.

581
01:03:56,045 --> 01:03:57,307
Attention
all passengers,

582
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:00,278
please keep all of your belongings
with you at all times.

583
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:02,611
Do not leave bags unattended.

584
01:04:08,258 --> 01:04:09,486
All five were killed.

585
01:04:10,326 --> 01:04:12,487
All five were killed.

586
01:04:12,662 --> 01:04:14,789
You probably knew some of
the men on that team.

587
01:04:29,312 --> 01:04:30,438
Taxi.

588
01:04:30,613 --> 01:04:31,637
Terminal D?

589
01:04:31,814 --> 01:04:33,475
Next bus. Down the street.

590
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:36,744
Leaves in 15 minutes. Thanks.

591
01:04:59,876 --> 01:05:03,505
When does this leave?
In 15 minutes.

592
01:05:07,283 --> 01:05:09,774
Doesn't give us much time, then.

593
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:15,580
What do you want?

594
01:05:17,694 --> 01:05:20,288
I wanna know what you're
doing alive.

595
01:05:21,297 --> 01:05:24,130
Last time I saw you, you had
a bullet in your head.

596
01:05:25,902 --> 01:05:28,496
What really happened in Cape Town?

597
01:05:28,671 --> 01:05:32,198
Where's the rest of your
team? They're dead.

598
01:05:33,176 --> 01:05:35,337
Who paid you? Was it Harry or Dean?

599
01:05:35,979 --> 01:05:39,210
Dean paid me a very large amount
of money to kill the others.

600
01:05:39,382 --> 01:05:41,873
Told me to fake my
death. Disappear.

601
01:05:42,752 --> 01:05:44,185
You know what else he told me?

602
01:05:44,354 --> 01:05:47,380
That Harry was getting suspicious
about a blown operation.

603
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:52,557
He was about to blow the whistle
and had to be taken care of.

604
01:05:53,763 --> 01:05:56,231
They knew just the man for the job.

605
01:05:56,899 --> 01:05:58,992
Someone who could get to him.

606
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:03,103
It's not the fact that
you killed him, is it?

607
01:06:03,806 --> 01:06:06,468
It's that they played you so easily.

608
01:06:06,643 --> 01:06:08,270
That's what bothers you.

609
01:06:08,878 --> 01:06:10,436
Am I right?

610
01:08:47,970 --> 01:08:50,632
Well? Not so good for your side.

611
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:55,504
Those were my two best teams. I
guess I'll have to send more.

612
01:08:56,045 --> 01:08:57,706
Save the fuel.

613
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,177
I'm coming for you.

614
01:09:06,856 --> 01:09:08,323
When
are you gonna be home?

615
01:09:08,491 --> 01:09:09,651
I'm really hungry.

616
01:09:09,826 --> 01:09:11,418
Where are you?

617
01:09:11,594 --> 01:09:13,494
I'm in the living room.

618
01:09:14,263 --> 01:09:17,289
Sit down on the couch. Okay.

619
01:09:17,467 --> 01:09:19,435
I'm guessing
you're not alone.

620
01:09:20,636 --> 01:09:22,763
There's a gun down the
left side cushion.

621
01:09:22,939 --> 01:09:25,100
It's loaded and the safety's off.

622
01:09:26,142 --> 01:09:27,370
But I'm not a lefty.

623
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:29,844
Then you're gonna die.

624
01:09:31,013 --> 01:09:33,174
All right. I'll see you
when you get here.

625
01:09:43,726 --> 01:09:45,694
I'll be there in five.

626
01:09:56,672 --> 01:10:00,199
Who sent those guys?
The man who employs me.

627
01:10:01,444 --> 01:10:04,607
Grab all the gear on the top shelf
and put it in the boat.

628
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,467
You set?

629
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,403
Get in the boat.

630
01:11:25,261 --> 01:11:27,661
You ever think about the
people you've killed?

631
01:11:31,367 --> 01:11:32,800
No.

632
01:11:33,903 --> 01:11:35,962
You ever kill someone you know?

633
01:11:42,378 --> 01:11:43,936
Yes.

634
01:11:46,048 --> 01:11:48,482
Did it feel any different?

635
01:11:52,088 --> 01:11:54,056
Not in the moment.

636
01:11:56,025 --> 01:11:57,652
After.

637
01:11:59,662 --> 01:12:06,090
Do you give them some kind of
warning or time to prepare?

638
01:12:06,736 --> 01:12:09,034
Kind of time to

639
01:12:11,674 --> 01:12:13,505
make peace?

640
01:12:17,513 --> 01:12:19,378
There's no peace.

641
01:12:23,319 --> 01:12:27,551
So it's best not to let them
know when you're coming.

642
01:12:33,696 --> 01:12:35,288
Yes.

643
01:12:36,699 --> 01:12:38,633
I guess it doesn't really
matter anyway,

644
01:12:38,801 --> 01:12:41,599
as long as they're dead
and you're not, right?

645
01:13:05,261 --> 01:13:06,319
Hello, Finch.

646
01:13:13,169 --> 01:13:15,933
Oh, my God, who are you?

647
01:13:17,273 --> 01:13:22,677
What are you doing here?
Oh, God. Jesus.

648
01:13:26,916 --> 01:13:29,544
I want you to listen to me closely.

649
01:13:29,719 --> 01:13:32,119
I don't care who I hurt or who I kill.

650
01:13:32,288 --> 01:13:33,949
Understand?

651
01:13:36,859 --> 01:13:39,020
No, please. No.

652
01:13:39,195 --> 01:13:41,629
No, no, no.

653
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:47,562
You're gonna tell me exactly what
I came here to find out.

654
01:13:48,037 --> 01:13:50,198
Where's Dean?

655
01:14:03,819 --> 01:14:05,912
It's up to you how far I go.

656
01:14:08,491 --> 01:14:09,583
Fingers.

657
01:14:11,927 --> 01:14:12,951
Wrist.

658
01:14:15,030 --> 01:14:16,258
Elbow.

659
01:14:16,432 --> 01:14:19,833
Jesus, John, tell him what
he wants to know.

660
01:14:28,477 --> 01:14:29,501
Okay, okay.

661
01:14:29,678 --> 01:14:31,646
300 Colby Plaza.

662
01:14:32,581 --> 01:14:35,414
300 Colby Plaza. That's
where he is, I swear.

663
01:14:44,393 --> 01:14:46,793
Looks like you're gonna
miss a good dinner.

664
01:14:48,998 --> 01:14:52,092
My God, you're a bastard.

665
01:15:03,546 --> 01:15:04,843
Yes.

666
01:15:05,014 --> 01:15:08,142
How much
was Harry's life worth?

667
01:15:09,652 --> 01:15:11,483
Fifty million.

668
01:15:13,122 --> 01:15:15,181
And here's what I'm gonna do.

669
01:15:15,658 --> 01:15:19,492
Ten million wired to the bank of
your choice within 24 hours.

670
01:15:20,696 --> 01:15:22,425
It's a good deal. You should take it.

671
01:15:22,598 --> 01:15:24,532
Not interested.

672
01:15:25,234 --> 01:15:27,862
The killer grows a conscience.

673
01:15:28,037 --> 01:15:31,598
I'd say that's a breach of professional
ethics, Mr. Bishop.

674
01:15:32,341 --> 01:15:35,572
Harry's death was business,
pure and simple.

675
01:15:35,744 --> 01:15:38,611
Well, it's not gonna
be so simple now.

676
01:15:38,781 --> 01:15:40,612
You got that right.

677
01:15:40,783 --> 01:15:44,241
Because now I'm gonna put a price
on your head that's so big,

678
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:46,012
when you look in the mirror,

679
01:15:46,188 --> 01:15:48,713
your reflection's gonna wanna
shoot you in the face.

680
01:15:48,891 --> 01:15:52,850
You won't survive that
long. You're a fool.

681
01:15:53,028 --> 01:15:55,792
You think you can get to
me before I get to you?

682
01:15:55,965 --> 01:15:57,762
I already have.

683
01:16:02,938 --> 01:16:04,166
Where's Conference Room E?

684
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:05,500
Floor
upstairs, sir.

685
01:16:05,674 --> 01:16:08,370
He's in the building. Get
me the fuck out of here.

686
01:17:05,634 --> 01:17:08,159
Did they find Bishop? Nothing yet.

687
01:17:09,038 --> 01:17:11,768
No, no, no. Get
off the fucking bus.

688
01:17:11,941 --> 01:17:14,967
Move. Get off the fucking
bus. Move.

689
01:17:43,472 --> 01:17:44,769
Go!

690
01:18:09,898 --> 01:18:11,263
Whoa!

691
01:18:22,344 --> 01:18:24,335
Back up, come on. Let's go.

692
01:19:13,495 --> 01:19:15,258
Fuck you.

693
01:19:45,194 --> 01:19:47,355
What's the plan now?

694
01:19:48,430 --> 01:19:50,125
Disappear.

695
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:52,926
New names. New occupation.

696
01:19:53,102 --> 01:19:54,569
Together?

697
01:19:57,106 --> 01:19:58,971
That's up to you.

698
01:19:59,475 --> 01:20:01,375
What are we gonna do?
We gonna whittle?

699
01:20:01,543 --> 01:20:04,842
We gonna get bunk beds?
Move into a teepee?

700
01:20:10,052 --> 01:20:11,747
Want a water?

701
01:20:24,266 --> 01:20:26,598
I've always had this

702
01:20:29,071 --> 01:20:31,631
anger inside,

703
01:20:31,807 --> 01:20:35,174
and now I feel like I have
a place to put it.

704
01:20:35,344 --> 01:20:38,643
I think I would miss this
if I had to stop now.

705
01:20:44,419 --> 01:20:47,547
I could always go into
business for myself.

706
01:20:48,023 --> 01:20:51,083
There are a lot of people
out there who would pay.

707
01:20:52,394 --> 01:20:54,487
And I think you were wrong.

708
01:20:56,265 --> 01:20:59,632
Vengeance is the mission.

709
01:21:19,354 --> 01:21:22,482
You want anything? No.

710
01:21:41,043 --> 01:21:42,908
Last chance.

711
01:21:44,379 --> 01:21:45,903

Steven.

713
01:21:52,287 --> 01:21:54,585
I'm sorry for everything
that happened.

01:21:56,325 --> 01:21:58,520
Well, you know me, man.

715
01:21:58,694 --> 01:22:00,719
I don't give a shit.

716
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:47,017
All four cameras.

717
01:25:47,189 --> 01:25:50,750
Watch number two. Okay.

718
01:25:52,127 --> 01:25:54,925
