00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:55,780
to Bulldog Collections;
that's me.

162
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:59,883
- Well, Mr. Bulldog.
- Polk. T.R. Polk.

163
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:04,226
I retire in October.
When I go, I'm goin' with a perfect record.

164
00:11:04,298 --> 00:11:09,292
So no piss-yellow coupe is gonna
keep me out of the hall of fame.

165
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,497
- [Whistle Blowing]
- Now, what's in the shed?

166
00:11:11,572 --> 00:11:15,303
Look, I really should be gettin'
down to the plant.

167
00:11:15,376 --> 00:11:19,745
[Speaking With Country Accent]
Dad! Dad! Oh, nellie, Dad! It's an emergency!

168
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:23,977
Uh, the plant just called.
Number three turbine's out of alignment.

169
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:27,509
Hold your horses there,
Alphonse.

170
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:30,921
Can't you see I'm helping
this man find a missing car?

171
00:11:37,398 --> 00:11:39,491
Not here.

172
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,534
Of course it ain't.

173
00:11:41,602 --> 00:11:44,196
Sorry about the door.

174
00:11:46,607 --> 00:11:49,872
- Your kid, huh?
- Yup. Heir to the throne.

175
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:52,673
Well, Van Welker
had no children.

176
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:55,112
That's a tragedy.

177
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:58,015
Well, if he turns up, give me a call.
I'd appreciate it.

178
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:01,077
- So would the Ohio State Police.
- [Engine Starts]

179
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:09,561
- [Gaby] Don't hit him, Zack.
- I won't.

180
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,098
- [Horn Honking]
- [Gasps]

181
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:16,330
You know, you really oughta get the Club.
Any idiot can hot-wire a Gremlin.

182
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,702
What do you want from me?
The car was a dog.

183
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:24,301
Late at night, I used to hear it barking in
the driveway. [Imitates Barking]

184
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:27,836
Mr. Van Welker,
we don't care about the car.

185
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,543
How would you like
to make $1,000?

186
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,744
A thousand bucks.
Ha!

187
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,280
Chicken feed! Now, if you'll excuse me,
I gotta go call my broker.

188
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:41,259
555-0093.

189
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:44,593
- I'm sorry?
- Polk's phone number, Mr. Van Welker.

190
00:12:44,665 --> 00:12:47,156
Oh, I get it.
Shakedown time.

191
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:50,499
And people say kids today
lack ambition.

192
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:54,200
[Chuckles]
A thousand bucks, you say?

193
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:57,737
Hmm.

194
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:04,013
Mr. Himmel? Dennis Wozniak,
Binary Pines Computer Camp.

195
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:06,279
Been expecting ya.
Come on in.

196
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:08,287
Thanks.

197
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,923
- Hey, nice sweater.
- [Chuckling]

198
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:18,522
In today's job market, you've got to
master the skills of tomorrow, now.

199
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:22,626
For instance, 379 of the
Fortune 500 companies...

200
00:13:22,703 --> 00:13:26,537
use exactly the same
Novell netware release that we teach.

201
00:13:26,607 --> 00:13:28,939
Here, Mr. Grotowski.

202
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:33,139
Of course, you should know that our Trish
takes her precious horses pretty seriously.

203
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:37,809
Acting, Dad! This is theater camp.
Caitlin goes to riding camp.

204
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:39,876
Of course.

205
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:43,184
It does sound
interesting, Jerzy.

206
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:46,192
But she's been so happy at Lake Broadway,
and I think it's...

207
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,194
I don't know,
prestigious.

208
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:52,198
[Eastern European Accent]
Oh, it is fine program, Mrs. Prescott.

209
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:55,030
More than adequate.

210
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:59,038
But how deep can you go
in, uh, six weeks?

211
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:04,408
At Camp Sleek-Away,
we believe there are no fat people.

212
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:06,537
There's fat,
and there's people.

213
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:11,516
- Look, whatever dumb diet
you guys use, it won't work.
- Shh.

214
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:15,487
She's right.
Diets don't work.

215
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:17,717
- Chocolate cake works.
- [Scoffs]

216
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,692
Well, it sounds like
a hell of an operation, Savage...

217
00:14:20,761 --> 00:14:24,925
but as I said on the phone, Zachary will be
going back to Camp Steelgrave.

218
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:29,128
Well, Mr. Dell,
if you're happy with, uh...

219
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:31,933
Weepy's results...

220
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:34,405
I won't waste
your time.

221
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:37,170
Weepy?

222
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:41,544
Just a nickname
Sergeant Steelgrave picked up in 'Nam.

223
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:44,345
Isn't that interesting,
Morris?

224
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:48,047
- You should look up "interesting"
in the dictionary, Dad.
- Morris.

225
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:51,613
You know, Morris, if you were
an ordinary kid, it wouldn't matter so much.

226
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:54,388
But you've got such...

227
00:14:58,165 --> 00:15:01,100
- potential.
- [Laughs]

228
00:15:03,337 --> 00:15:08,707
And that is why our season
runs two weeks longer.

229
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:13,576
- She'd be gone for eight weeks?
- I know it is long time to be separated.

230
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:17,139
That means we wouldn't have to come back
from Europe until...

231
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:20,209
When's Parents' Day?
August?

232
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:24,781
At Shakespeare Hollow,
we do not have Parents' Day.

233
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:28,259
We feel it encourages
independence.

234
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:30,819
Say no more, Jerzy.

235
00:15:30,898 --> 00:15:34,664
I think we just have to do
what's right for our little girl.

236
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:40,367
- Mm-mm-mm-mm-mmm.
- It's fantastic!

237
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,501
- This is great cake!
- [Mumbling] It's very unusual.

238
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:47,172
I'll be right back.

239
00:15:48,482 --> 00:15:52,418
- God, what'd you do?
- Yours is Betty Crocker.

240
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:55,683
Hers is raw
liver paste.

241
00:15:55,756 --> 00:16:00,022
So if it tastes like poison,
it must be diet food.

242
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:04,189
[Phone Ringing]

243
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:07,791
Son, are you deaf or just stupid?
Answer that phone!

244
00:16:07,868 --> 00:16:10,063
I'm busy.
Get it yourself.

245
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:12,037
Answer it
or eat it, boy.

246
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:16,303
- [Ringing Continues]
- I see Weepy's worked wonders.

247
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:21,939
At Alpha Charlie,
we scrape 'em down to bare metal.

248
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,677
And it's worth it
when they look up at you and say...

249
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:29,484
"Dad was right, Major Savage. I am scum."

250
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:32,286
Answer the phone,
son.

251
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:35,556
- Yes, sir.
- [Ringing Continues]

252
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,555
- Dell residence.
- How's it goin'?

253
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:41,760
Check or plastic?

254
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,861
- Cash.
- Mission accomplished.

255
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:47,964
- We're in.
- [Together] Yes!

256
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:51,238
[Trish]
"Feln's Miracle Spa"?

257
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:55,748
- [Morris] Yeah, I found it in the newspaper.
- Where? In the obituaries?

258
00:16:55,816 --> 00:16:58,546
Trust me.
It's perfect.

259
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:02,179
So that's two cabins for the summer.
Am I right?

260
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:05,713
- If you want more, you gotta call me in Florida.
- So, I don't get it.

261
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:09,421
- Who built those tepees
and painted that weird bus?
- Ahhh!

262
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:13,694
That's interesting.
In the late '60s, a bunch of hippies...

263
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:16,258
made this place
into a commune.

264
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:21,706
You know, there was all sorts of
sex and drugs and debauchery.

265
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:24,266
I knew I'd
been here before.

266
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:28,644
- You mean you did that stuff here?
- No. Not here.

267
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,920
You won't regret this,
Mr. Bandersnatch.

268
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:38,424
You're in for the most peaceful,
relaxing summer...

269
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:41,290
of your whole lives.

270
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:44,228
- [Rumbling]
- [Gasping]

271
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:50,300
That was the Pineview
Air Force Base.

272
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,807
The 5... 15 flyby,
they call it.

273
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,139
You get used to it.
You get used to it.

274
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:01,203
Then you miss it when it doesn't happen.
[Chuckles]

275
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:04,842
- So we should just take the Greyhound.
- The bus?

276
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:08,376
- Why can't we rent a limo?
- You know what'd be cool?
We should hitchhike.

277
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:10,787
Yeah. That would be really cool.

278
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:15,317
And then we should just leave our pictures
behind for them to put on the milk cartons.

279
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:19,229
- Hey, guys, I've been checking
out the train schedules.
- [Doorbell Ringing]

280
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:22,268
Hold on a second.
I'll be right back.

281
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,997
- Hitchhike?
- Stupid.

282
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,902
Walter. Hi.

283
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:33,173
- Pretty slick, Mud.
- What?

284
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:37,444
I know what you're doing, Mud. That
computer camp you said you were going to;

285
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:40,315
There's no such camp.

286
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:44,915
Walter, if you tell anyone,
I'm gonna glue your mouth shut!

287
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:48,483
Look, I won't tell.
Not as long as you let me come.

288
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:51,759
- No.
- Okay. If I don't go, you don't go.

289
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,929
All right.
But you can't tell anyone.

290
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:58,994
I won't.

291
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:02,098
Walter, who'd you tell?

292
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:05,372
- Just Betty Stoller. You know,
the redhead girl in Bio Lab.
- You idiot!

293
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:09,279
- Come on, at her old camp,
they used to go skinny-dippin'.
- [Trish] No way!

294
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:12,045
I am not sharing a sink
with Betty Stoller!

295
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:15,850
I mean, she has food
stuck in her braces from last Christmas.

296
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:18,390
You're all in on this.

297
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,320
Walter, if you tell anybody
else, you're dead meat!

298
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:26,695
- Look, I won't tell.
- Uh-oh.

299
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:29,234
What? What?

00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:03,751
- Your son, Mud.
- ♪♪ Waa-aah ♪♪

485
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:08,665
- Ow!
- [Girl] Mud! Mud!

486
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:12,397
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I just burned my arm.

487
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:16,498
Who would think something like
this could happen from harmless
flares and Roman candles?

488
00:31:16,576 --> 00:31:19,704
- You know, Mud, that looks bad.
- Yeah, you really need a doctor.

489
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:23,738
No, you guys. If we call a doctor,
he's gonna call my mom
and we're gonna blow the summer.

490
00:31:23,816 --> 00:31:25,909
- Look, get Dennis, all right?
- Yeah.

491
00:31:30,156 --> 00:31:35,389
Oh, Jesus. If this is serious, Mud,
I'm taking you home.

492
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:39,898
My mama didn't raise no fools.
Oh, except my brother Todd.

493
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:44,801
He burns hair out of his nose
with fireplace matches. Todd's... special.

494
00:31:44,871 --> 00:31:47,499
Look, Dennis, I told you,
it's an extra 50 bucks.

495
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:51,065
Keep your money, pal.
Concussions and second degree burns on me.

496
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:54,977
Uh, uh. Hold still. Hold still.
Won't be another minute.

497
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:59,916
Take your time, Dr. Dunbar.
I've still gotta find six weasels in this picture.

498
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,888
Oooh, there's one.

499
00:32:02,955 --> 00:32:05,981
We do have other magazines.
There's Newsweek somewhere.

500
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,757
Oh.
Mideast peace talks.

501
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:13,663
Yeah. Twelve weasels
hidden in that one.

502
00:32:13,733 --> 00:32:16,293
So, Morris,
how did this happen?

503
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:20,772
Not playing with fireworks,
by any chance?

504
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:26,739
No. I burned it
on the stove making breakfast.

505
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:31,146
Ah. Yes. Those Fourth ofJuly breakfasts,
very hazardous.

506
00:32:31,217 --> 00:32:33,981
Well, I think
we can save the hand.

507
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:36,283
But I'm gonna need to see you again.
Say, Tuesday?

508
00:32:37,356 --> 00:32:40,189
Bye, Mud.
Feel better.

509
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:43,888
You know, we are supposed to report
firework injuries to the police.

510
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:46,090
- No. Really?
- Yeah.

511
00:32:46,165 --> 00:32:48,565
- The stove is ancient.
- Thought about a microwave?

512
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:53,594
- Can't do it. Cat's got a pacemaker.
- Look, I don't know much about...

513
00:32:53,673 --> 00:32:58,804
I don't know much about stoves, but I do know
something about second-degree burns.

514
00:32:58,878 --> 00:33:01,870
Yeah, well, what do you know about
raisin' a kid alone?

515
00:33:01,948 --> 00:33:06,476
What do you know about holding down two
jobs so your kids get the breaks you didn't?

516
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:09,646
I mean, do you and your husband
even have children?

517
00:33:09,722 --> 00:33:12,190
I'm not married.
What are you getting at?

518
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:15,393
I'm not sure.

519
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:20,330
Frankly, I kinda lost the thread there myself.
Tuesday, you say?

520
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,458
Yeah.
Tuesday.

521
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,803
- I'll bring Mud along.
- Good idea.

522
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:35,404
Now, don't forget to take your pills, young un.
Four, every hour.

523

Uh, Dennis, that's one
every four hours.

524
00:33:39,752 --> 00:33:44,246

You know,
back in the '60s...

530
00:33:59,472 --> 00:34:02,635
when we said we wanted
to change society...

531
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:05,677
maybe we should have
been more specific.

532
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:14,711
- Hello, Officer.
- Trooper Elliot Hendricks.

533
00:34:14,787 --> 00:34:16,721

Uh, with a "P-H."

537
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:32,702
What can I do for you,
Officer?

538
00:34:32,772 --> 00:34:36,401
- Well, Mr., uh, Phlurm.
- Phlurm.

539
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:41,276
We've had some reports of a gang
of unruly kids in the area.
I thought I'd come check it out.

540
00:34:41,347 --> 00:34:44,839
- Do you mind if we talk?
- Oh, not at all.

541
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:47,943
Uh, Rudolph,
go inside.

542
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:52,184
Put on some coffee and, uh, clean up
a little bit, okay?

543
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:54,226
Okay, Dad.

544
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:58,059
I had a report of a fireworks display,
some loud music...

545
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:01,463
Mrs. Levinson found paint splattered
on her new garage door.

546
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:03,468
Probably a couple
of rowdy kids.

547
00:35:03,536 --> 00:35:07,302
Gosh, Officer, it's just me and Rudy
renting the lodge here.

548
00:35:07,373 --> 00:35:11,139
Rudy's no rowdy.
But, hey, if I can help with anything else.

549
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:14,771
I'd still like to ask your son a few questions,
if you don't mind.

down by the lake
on the Fourth.

- Uh, no, Officer. I... Mm-mmm.

Uh-huh.

557
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:43,368
I'll bet you don't know anything about a bunch
of kids running through Mrs. O'Neil's garden.

00:35:43,442 --> 00:35:46,309
Uh, no,

But the people were filled with fear.

646
00:41:19,445 --> 00:41:22,175
[Trish]
They prayed for seven days and seven nights...

647
00:41:22,247 --> 00:41:25,341
until the heavens finally
answered their call.

648
00:41:25,417 --> 00:41:28,614
And so, the goddess defeated
the army of demons.

649
00:41:31,924 --> 00:41:34,859
- [All Gasping]
- [Moaning]

650
00:41:36,528 --> 00:41:40,624
[Dennis]
Then, vomited up the sun and the stars...

651
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:44,635
back into the inky
curtain ofheaven.

652
00:41:44,703 --> 00:41:48,002
[Trish]
And thus, the heavens were preserved.

653
00:41:48,073 --> 00:41:51,008
[Dennis]
Then, the windmill of the gods...

654
00:41:51,076 --> 00:41:53,738
began to turn...
again.

655
00:41:56,548 --> 00:42:00,382
That was really,
really cool.

656
00:42:00,452 --> 00:42:03,319
Thanks a lot,
Dennis.

[Chattering]

659
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:17,626
- Thanks, Gaby.
- You're welcome.

660
00:42:17,703 --> 00:42:20,171
- Whatcha doin'?
- Omelettes.

661
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:24,437
- Here, get to work.
- What's wrong with Pop Tarts and Slim Jims?

662
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:27,877
I don't know.
I just kind of got tired of the stuff.

663
00:42:27,946 --> 00:42:30,847
Why don't you
chop some mushrooms?

664
00:42:32,284 --> 00:42:34,377
I don't get it.
I mean...

665
00:42:34,453 --> 00:42:37,513
what happened to the part
about the best summer of our lives?

666
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:41,355
- I mean, why do we end up doing all the work?
- Same reason we don't shoplift...

667
00:42:41,426 --> 00:42:43,690
or cut class:
It's a curse.

668
00:42:43,762 --> 00:42:47,926
- I shoplifted once.
- Ha! You stole something?

669
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,460
- Uh-huh.
- Ten to one you went back and paid.

670
00:42:54,373 --> 00:42:58,332
Okay, you're right.
It's a curse. I...

671
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:01,038
Look, I'm just glad
there's two of us.

672
00:43:01,113 --> 00:43:03,081
Me too.

673
00:43:06,919 --> 00:43:09,285
Okay, troops,

- You said plain.

Okay, fine, you win.

Who says you can't
learn anything from cartoons?

682
00:43:32,477 --> 00:43:34,672
Good one.
[Chuckles]

683
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:38,546
So, keep it bandaged till the weekend,
don't get it wet...

684
00:43:38,617 --> 00:43:42,053
and if anybody asks,
you took a bullet for the president.

685
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:46,454
- All right.
- So you and your dad been
sharing chores in the kitchen?

686
00:43:46,525 --> 00:43:48,584
Oh, yes.
Every meal.

687
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,788
That must be tough
with your dad working all the time.

688
00:43:51,863 --> 00:43:54,855
Oh, no, see,
he makes the time.

689
00:43:54,933 --> 00:43:57,800
Yeah. Because we...
we do stuff together.

690
00:43:57,869 --> 00:44:01,464
We play baseball.
Yeah. And we, uh...

691
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,473
chase squirrels?

692
00:44:05,544 --> 00:44:09,071
I mean, we talk a lot! [Chuckles]
Yeah, we talk a lot.

And, uh... And you...
I mean, me and him, we're... Well...

we're best friends.

He gives me tons of advice
about teenage problems like...

696

on drugs and alcohol
and girls and...

697
00:44:22,794 --> 00:44:26,958

and acne and peer pressure.

- [Snaps Finger]
- Great.

699
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,926
He's my role model.

700
00:44:32,004 --> 00:44:34,905
Well, uh, I think
you'll pull through.

701
00:44:34,973 --> 00:44:37,441
You could stand to gain
a few pounds though.

702
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:42,469
Well, if you're concerned about the nutritional
arrangements, why not check 'em out yourself?

703
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:47,847
- Pardon me?
- Come over for dinner Friday.

704
00:44:50,555 --> 00:44:55,356
If I don't feed you from all four food groups,
you can report me to the authorities.

705
00:44:55,427 --> 00:45:01,059
- That won't be necessary.
- Come on. It's part of the Hippocratic oath.

706
00:45:01,133 --> 00:45:04,398
I don't recall Hippocrates
mentioning dinner.

707
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:07,233
Then he was a fool.

708
00:45:11,843 --> 00:45:15,540
Come on. Don't make me
burn the kid's arm again.

709
00:45:18,483 --> 00:45:21,043
I'll be there.
[Laughs]

710
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,053
All right.

711
00:45:29,761 --> 00:45:33,219
But how could you invite her over?
I mean, she's gonna find out.

712
00:45:33,298 --> 00:45:36,199
Mud, in a couple of years,
two things will happen:

713
00:45:36,268 --> 00:45:41,467
One: You'll grow a ridiculous mustache
that looks like fruit mold on your upper lip;

714
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:45,067
two... you'll suddenly
understand why men...

715
00:45:45,143 --> 00:45:48,135
invite charming,
attractive women to dinner.

716
00:45:48,213 --> 00:45:52,809
- But, Dennis...
- Relax, Mud. Van Welker
will protect your secret.

717
00:45:52,884 --> 00:45:56,718
Besides, Mom always
wanted me to marry a doctor.

- Ow!
- Bonjour, guys. We got beer.

719
00:46:03,395 --> 00:46:06,091
Zack, they're
gonna card you.

720
00:46:06,164 --> 00:46:07,688
[Zack]
Chill, Mud.

721
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:09,666
This is way covered.

722
00:46:11,837 --> 00:46:14,431
I. D?
You gotta be 19 to buy this stuff.

723
00:46:14,506 --> 00:46:17,566
No problemo.

724
00:46:19,244 --> 00:46:22,736
- You were born in 1963?
- Yeah.

725
00:46:22,814 --> 00:46:25,476
- [Chuckles] So that would make you...
- 21.

726
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:29,646
No! This is 1994.
That would make you 31.

727
00:46:29,721 --> 00:46:33,054
Wrong.
If he was born in 1963...

728
00:46:33,125 --> 00:46:37,619
and he's 21 then it's 1984.

Can I see that I.D.,
Bobby?

730
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,861
Purchasing alcohol with a fake I.D.
Is a crime in this state, son.

731
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:49,304
But it's for my dad!
He's in the parking lot.

732
00:46:49,374 --> 00:46:52,537
He's very, very, uh, handicapped.
I'll go get him.

733
00:46:52,611 --> 00:46:56,945
I'm sorry, son. Get Officer Hendricks over here.
Tell him we got an underage.

734
00:46:57,015 --> 00:46:59,313
- Let's go, son.
- No! Dad!

735
00:46:59,384 --> 00:47:02,319
Dad?

736
00:47:02,387 --> 00:47:04,617
- Dad?
- Dad.

737
00:47:04,689 --> 00:47:09,649
This guy didn't believe I was buyin' beer
for you 'cause of your bum leg.

738
00:47:09,728 --> 00:47:13,164
Oh.
[Laughs]

739
00:47:13,231 --> 00:47:17,531
So, you had trouble
buyin' brew...

740
00:47:17,602 --> 00:47:20,162
for your dear,
old dad.

- That's my dad.

Sorry for the misunderstanding, Mike.

743

But, the beer
is for me.

Well, it's...
it's very lifelike, sir.

750
00:47:46,631 --> 00:47:50,032
Ha-ha! And you don't
waste time washing it.

751
00:47:50,101 --> 00:47:53,434
A little floor wax twice a month
and I'm in business.

752
00:47:53,505 --> 00:47:56,235
- Uh-huh.
- [Gaby] That was close.

Oh, I know. Tres close.

- There's a cop following us.
- Uh-oh. It's Hendricks.

758
00:48:16,761 --> 00:48:19,821
- [Trish] This'll never work.
- [Dennis] Haven't you ever
heard of a clean getaway?

759
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:23,231
- [Zack] I still think we could
have got the beer.
- You could've gotten probation.

760
00:48:23,301 --> 00:48:26,668
Stay in the car. I'll check it out.
Hey, see you, guys.

- Help you, Officer?
- Yeah. Have you seen a...

765
00:48:40,185 --> 00:48:42,983
Haven't I seen you
out at the Feln place?

766

- Phlurm.
- Come on, just pull in. Spiff up
the cruiser for you. No charge.

- Thanks. Hey, have you seen
any Caribbean yellow Gremlins?
- No problem.

No, but I seen a couple
of little blue pixies.

- Do I get out or what?
- No! Just roll up your window.

770
00:48:56,868 --> 00:49:01,305
- Oh, damn.
- Phlurm, what the hell are you doing?

771
00:49:01,373 --> 00:49:05,935
I'm gonna talk you through the process.
A little service Wigwam provides...

772
00:49:06,011 --> 00:49:09,606
to help the customers better understand
the car wash experience.

773

This is soap that's biodegradable.

774
00:49:13,585 --> 00:49:17,146
Think how much this would hurt...
[Groaning]

775
00:49:17,222 --> 00:49:20,988
If we used old-fashioned
abrasive brushes! Ah!

776

You can feel it working.

777
00:49:24,562 --> 00:49:27,156
Whoa! Gotta love it!
Gotta love it!

778
00:49:27,232 --> 00:49:30,929
We rinse with water
heated to 130.

779
00:49:32,203 --> 00:49:35,104
[Groaning]
Or maybe 140 degrees!

Dennis,
what happened?

00:50:00,098 --> 00:50:03,864
Complimentary hot wax.

787
00:50:07,439 --> 00:50:10,067

Hurry, get in!

[Mud]
Okay, time for another letter to our parents.

790
00:50:20,485 --> 00:50:24,683
Now, the computer camp had a big pizza
cookout on Friday. We watched Star Trek IV.

791
00:50:24,756 --> 00:50:28,590
- Everybody seen that?
- Is that the one where he
fights the big Russian guy?

792
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:31,026
Arnold, that's Rocky IV.

793
00:50:31,096 --> 00:50:36,261
- How do you spell pizza?
- No, no, Lenny, you're at fat camp, remember?

794
00:50:36,334 --> 00:50:41,431
You don't get pizza at fat camp.
You get... chicken breasts with
lemon. Now write that down.

795
00:50:41,506 --> 00:50:44,600
Pizza in fat camp.
What a dope!

796
00:50:44,676 --> 00:50:47,201
- [Kids Laughing]
- Check the Barney.

797
00:50:47,278 --> 00:50:51,078
Why don't you tell them about how you
won the pie-eating contest too, Lenny?

798
00:50:51,149 --> 00:50:54,550
- [Kids] Oooh.
- Sniff my butt, toe breath.

799
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:58,521
- Would you guys shut up?
- Hey, midget, find my Waldo.

800
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:01,991
- What Waldo?
- Would you guys be careful?

801
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:05,461
- Back off, geek!
- You're gonna put somebody's
eye out with that!

802
00:51:10,001 --> 00:51:12,629
I'm turning
into my parents.

803
00:51:12,704 --> 00:51:15,298

Are you okay?

01:14:14,818 --> 01:14:17,753
[Dance]

1133
01:14:19,856 --> 01:14:21,483
[Together]
Yes!

1134
01:14:21,558 --> 01:14:23,492
- [Both Grunt]
- Sleek-away sign, clear!

1135
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,755
All right,
let's sweat!

1136
01:14:25,829 --> 01:14:29,162
- [Continues]
- Tummies tucked, buttocks pinched!

1137
01:14:29,232 --> 01:14:31,496
Only 600 more!

1138
01:14:31,568 --> 01:14:35,971
Then you can taste
some of our famous chocolate cake!

1139
01:14:36,039 --> 01:14:38,269
- Where are the C-rations?
- Right here.

1140
01:14:38,341 --> 01:14:41,742
- How's your dad?
- Miserable. He hates liverwurst.

1141
01:14:41,812 --> 01:14:43,746
- Thanks.
- [Chuckling]

1142
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:48,109
- Oh, my God!
- Mom?

1143
01:14:48,185 --> 01:14:52,884
- Oh, my God, you are so skinny!
- Really, I can explain.

1144
01:14:52,956 --> 01:14:55,220
You see, it...
I'm what?

1145
01:14:55,292 --> 01:14:58,557
Look at you, you're bony.
What, did you lose 10, 15 pounds?

1146
01:14:58,628 --> 01:15:01,290
- Here, turn around. Let me look at you.
- Mom, stop!

1147
01:15:01,364 --> 01:15:03,628
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be in the islands.

1148
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:05,634
I missed you.

1149
01:15:05,702 --> 01:15:09,297
- What?
- Look at you, you're practically svelte.

1150
01:15:11,141 --> 01:15:13,166
Yeah.

1151
01:15:13,243 --> 01:15:15,404
[Both Laughing]

1152
01:15:15,479 --> 01:15:17,413
- Mom?
- Hmm?

1153
01:15:17,481 --> 01:15:20,712
- I'm really glad you came.
- Me too.

1154
01:15:20,784 --> 01:15:24,049
- Want a piece of chocolate cake?
- Sure.

1155
01:15:26,823 --> 01:15:28,791
Hey, Dad,
how're you holdin' out?

1156
01:15:28,859 --> 01:15:32,158
- [Groans] Freezing my nuts off!
- You can thaw 'em out later.

1157
01:15:32,229 --> 01:15:34,163
We got a cease fire
till 12:45...

1158
01:15:34,231 --> 01:15:36,392
- so I snuck some lunch through the lines.
- All right.

1159
01:15:36,466 --> 01:15:39,526
- Hey, watch out!
- What? What?

1160
01:15:39,603 --> 01:15:41,537
Oh, a decoy.
Here.

1161
01:15:41,605 --> 01:15:44,438
Oh, man, that looks good.
Thanks.

1162
01:15:47,143 --> 01:15:50,271
- [Spits]
- [Machine Gun Fire]

1163
01:15:50,347 --> 01:15:52,338
I give up!

1164
01:15:52,415 --> 01:15:54,349
[Clears Throat]

1165
01:15:56,186 --> 01:15:59,883
- Mom? What?
- Sorry to wake you, Officer.

1166
01:15:59,956 --> 01:16:02,356
T.R. Polk,
Bulldog Collections.

1167
01:16:02,425 --> 01:16:07,021
Trying to get a line on a 1979 Gremlin,
Caribbean yellow.

1168
01:16:07,097 --> 01:16:10,533
That's strange.
So am I.

1169
01:16:12,002 --> 01:16:14,061
Is that so?

1170
01:16:14,137 --> 01:16:17,368
Tell me, you happen
to know this guy?

1171
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:20,466
Mr. Polk, I think we have
something to talk about.

1172
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:26,215
- This is ridiculous!
- Dad!

1173
01:16:27,317 --> 01:16:29,285
Duck!

1174
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,654
Have a good one!

1175
01:16:34,157 --> 01:16:36,057
- Loads on the road.
- Go.

1176
01:16:36,126 --> 01:16:40,426
- All right, fat parents are clear. What's next?
- Hurry up!

1177
01:16:40,497 --> 01:16:43,432
We have 16 minutes to pull the switch.
This is the big one.

1178
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:45,798
Go, go, come on!
Change to the last sign.

1179
01:16:45,869 --> 01:16:48,099
Check.

1180
01:16:48,171 --> 01:16:50,264
Fire.

1181
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:53,605
- Hurry, Tim!
- Got it!

1182
01:16:57,213 --> 01:16:59,443
- [Tim] Uh-oh.
- We got trouble. The sign's stuck!

1183
01:16:59,516 --> 01:17:01,780
We got a snafu
at the sign, Mud.

1184
01:17:01,851 --> 01:17:04,285
[Ashley]
We're in big trouble!

1185
01:17:04,354 --> 01:17:06,413
Go, go!
Come on, Jill.

1186
01:17:06,489 --> 01:17:08,684
- Pull!
- It's stuck!

1187
01:17:08,758 --> 01:17:12,455
[Mr. Himmel] We'll be there in a couple of
minutes. I knew we could do it in two hours.

1188
01:17:12,529 --> 01:17:14,360
[Mud]
Talk to me, Amber.

1189
01:17:14,431 --> 01:17:17,332
- How much time do we have?
- 15 seconds.

1190
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,265
Pete, Tim, do something!

1191
01:17:19,336 --> 01:17:21,634
Tim, it's over!
We're dead!

1192
01:17:21,705 --> 01:17:23,696
Whoa!

1193
01:17:23,773 --> 01:17:27,436
- [Groans]
- The sign's clear.

1194
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:29,876
We may have lost Jill.

1195
01:17:30,981 --> 01:17:34,974
[Chuckles, Blubbers]
Let's go!

1196
01:17:35,051 --> 01:17:38,316
[Mr. Himmel]
You see, 82.5 miles.

1197
01:17:38,388 --> 01:17:40,856
The nerds are here.
Over.

1198
01:17:43,226 --> 01:17:45,660
I just don't understand
how we messed up the time.

1199
01:17:45,729 --> 01:17:48,994
- I thought it started at 5:00.
- Mega-regrets for the time confusion.

1200
01:17:49,065 --> 01:17:51,397
You can still catch
the end of our demo.

1201
01:17:51,468 --> 01:17:56,872
This is our computer center. We have
60 substations linked to our Cray 3000.

1202
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:59,966
- Okay, we're cracking codes.
- [Dennis] Entry codes of course.

1203
01:18:00,043 --> 01:18:04,002
- [Mud] We're into Pineview.
- Let's see what we can do in mode yellow.

1204
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:07,413
- What are you doing, boys?
- Mode yellow?

1205
01:18:07,484 --> 01:18:10,976
Is this Pineview...
Air Force Base?

1206
01:18:12,055 --> 01:18:14,489
Status confirm.
Yes or no?

1207
01:18:14,557 --> 01:18:16,525
- Yes!
- Yes!
- No!

1208
01:18:16,593 --> 01:18:19,357
[Walter]
Okay, let's scramble thejets.

1209
01:18:21,831 --> 01:18:24,891
- Good Lord, what is happening here?
- Relax, it's not a real alert.

1210
01:18:24,968 --> 01:18:28,563
They can't crack Pentagon codes.
[Laughing Nervously]

1211
01:18:31,574 --> 01:18:34,236
Can you?

1212
01:18:40,016 --> 01:18:43,417
- Incoming!
- [Shouting]

1213
01:18:43,486 --> 01:18:46,421
[Dennis]
Well, that concludes our demonstration.

1214
01:18:46,489 --> 01:18:49,720
We have to perform some,
uh, routine maintenance.

1215
01:18:49,793 --> 01:18:52,819
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be all right.

1216
01:18:52,896 --> 01:18:56,263
Dennis will fix it. I just think I should
stay here and help him out.

1217
01:18:56,332 --> 01:18:59,893
- No problem. We'll be waiting out in the car.
- Good idea.

1218
01:18:59,969 --> 01:19:02,802
Good-bye.
Thanks for coming.

1219
01:19:02,872 --> 01:19:05,841
We have to report back
to the interrogation tent.

1220
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:10,275
Well, l-l-l-I'd like
to go, Son...

1221
01:19:10,346 --> 01:19:15,113
but I've got a busy day tomorrow:
A few meetings, dry cleaners.

1222
01:19:15,185 --> 01:19:18,916
- I'll see you when you get home from camp.
- Okay.

1223
01:19:37,774 --> 01:19:39,799
It's a fine camp.

1224
01:19:39,876 --> 01:19:41,810
I had a great time.

1225
01:19:50,086 --> 01:19:54,648
Don't worry. I read in Newsweek some
14-year-old cracked the AT&Tcomputers.

1226
01:19:54,724 --> 01:19:59,525
- Now he gets 100,000 a year
as a security consultant.
- Excuse me, folks.

1227
01:19:59,596 --> 01:20:02,622
You haven't, by any chance,
seen this man, have you?

1228
01:20:02,699 --> 01:20:06,135
You mean Mr. Wozniak?

1229
01:20:10,774 --> 01:20:13,868
Okay, he was
right... here.

1230
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:22,445
[Coughing]

1231
01:20:31,027 --> 01:20:32,858
Huh?

1232
01:20:34,964 --> 01:20:36,488
[Grunting]

1233
01:20:48,645 --> 01:20:50,806
[Yells]

1234
01:20:59,756 --> 01:21:02,657
[All Gasping]

1235
01:21:12,669 --> 01:21:15,365
Dennis Van Welker?

1236
01:21:18,508 --> 01:21:20,999
Morris?

1237
01:21:22,145 --> 01:21:24,079
Hi, Dad.

1238
01:21:31,421 --> 01:21:34,788
Where's Van Welker, kid?

1239
01:21:34,858 --> 01:21:38,123
Uh, I seriously,
truthfully do not know.

1240
01:21:38,194 --> 01:21:40,185
Mr. And Mrs. Himmel.

1241
01:21:42,932 --> 01:21:45,992
This kid says Van Welker's got a cabin
down by the lake, sir.

1242
01:21:46,069 --> 01:21:49,561
- Ricky!
- Huh. He tortured me.

1243
01:21:49,639 --> 01:21:53,040
Send somebody to get him. I want to
talk to this Van Welker clown, pronto!

1244
01:21:53,109 --> 01:21:54,599
Yes, sir.

1245
01:21:54,677 --> 01:21:57,077
Mr. And Mrs. Himmel...

1246
01:21:57,146 --> 01:22:00,673
how much weight
did your son actually lose?

1247
01:22:07,523 --> 01:22:10,253
Dennis, they're coming
after you, the cops!

1248
01:22:10,326 --> 01:22:13,420
The moms are going crazy
and the kids are getting worried!

1249
01:22:13,496 --> 01:22:16,260
- Whoa-oh, slow down!
- What are we gonna do?

1250
01:22:16,332 --> 01:22:19,426
Mud, I can't speak for "we."
I can only speak for "me."

1251
01:22:19,502 --> 01:22:23,768
And "me" is getting out of here
just as fast as my Goodyear radials can go.

1252
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,774
Dennis,
this is serious.

1253
01:22:25,842 --> 01:22:28,936
Yes, a lot more serious
for me than for you.

1254
01:22:29,012 --> 01:22:34,109
You're a kid! What can they do?
Spank you? Ground you?

1255
01:22:34,183 --> 01:22:36,447
If they ground me, Mud...

1256
01:22:36,519 --> 01:22:39,386
it's gonna be
in a concrete room...

1257
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:44,586
with a vertical bar motif
and a 200-pound fiance named Duke.

1258
01:22:44,661 --> 01:22:50,531
- Dennis, you can't just leave.
- Mud, it's gonna be okay.

1259
01:22:53,002 --> 01:22:57,371
Here's what you do: Get lost,
vanish into the woods for five, six hours.

1260
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:00,705
When you show up, they'll be so glad
you hadn't been eaten by bears...

1261
01:23:00,777 --> 01:23:03,143
they'll let
the other stuff slide.

1262
01:23:04,881 --> 01:23:07,782
- I guess.
- Guaranteed!

1263
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:10,114
It'll be like
a movie-of-the-week!

1264
01:23:10,186 --> 01:23:12,120
Okay.

1265
01:23:16,059 --> 01:23:18,050
Mud, sit down.

1266
01:23:20,496 --> 01:23:23,556
[Sighs]
I'm sorry things didn't work out, Mud.

1267
01:23:25,368 --> 01:23:28,098
Sometimes the windmill
of the gods...

1268
01:23:28,171 --> 01:23:31,231
casts us up
to the stars.

1269
01:23:31,307 --> 01:23:34,470
Sometimes it flings us
down into the dirt.

1270
01:23:46,856 --> 01:23:48,790
Au revoir...

1271
01:23:48,858 --> 01:23:50,849
mon ami.

1272
01:24:01,404 --> 01:24:03,338
See ya.

1273
01:24:18,588 --> 01:24:20,522
- Hey, Mud.
- Dr. Dunbar.

1274
01:24:20,590 --> 01:24:23,582
How come
you're not at camp?

1275
01:24:23,659 --> 01:24:26,594
- Camp's over. We got busted.
- Yeah, I know.

1276
01:24:28,331 --> 01:24:30,265
Where's Dennis?

1277
01:24:30,333 --> 01:24:32,927
The police are looking for him.
I mean, if they catch him...

1278
01:24:33,002 --> 01:24:35,436
He'll be held responsible.

1279
01:24:37,807 --> 01:24:40,241
So, let me guess.
He took off.

1280
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:46,773
So, what are you
doing here?

1281
01:24:46,849 --> 01:24:51,286
- Uh, I thought I'd hang out
in the woods for a while.
- Right.

1282
01:24:51,354 --> 01:24:55,222
Till your parents were so worried
they wouldn't think about punishing you.

1283
01:24:55,291 --> 01:24:58,886
Something tells me
that wasn't your idea.

1284
01:25:01,831 --> 01:25:04,766
Been planning this
for five, six years.

1285
01:25:04,834 --> 01:25:07,268
The camp idea
was perfect!

1286
01:25:07,336 --> 01:25:10,271
Find kids with access
to cash...

1287
01:25:10,339 --> 01:25:14,776
get 'em away from their parents,
lots of junk food.

1288
01:25:14,844 --> 01:25:19,907
Win their confidence,
then start with the religious indoctrination.

1289
01:25:19,982 --> 01:25:23,418
- He didn't take off.
- No, I guess he didn't.

1290
01:25:23,486 --> 01:25:26,148
His title was "Most High
And Holy Worship."

1291
01:25:26,222 --> 01:25:29,089
Rama Sri Havagnoli.

1292
01:25:29,158 --> 01:25:32,855
- That's H-A-V-A...
- Nice try, Dennis.
