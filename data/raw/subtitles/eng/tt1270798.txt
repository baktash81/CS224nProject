00:00:37,779 --> 00:00:40,740
(Pages flipping)

2
00:01:01,302 --> 00:01:04,514
POLAND, 1944

3
00:01:04,889 --> 00:01:07,642
(Rain falling, people shouting)

4
00:01:11,854 --> 00:01:14,524
(Guards shouting orders)

5
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,413
(Boy crying)

6
00:01:31,082 --> 00:01:32,125
(Mother shouting)

7
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,887
(Boy screaming)

8
00:01:55,607 --> 00:01:56,649
(Gate creaking)

9
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:17,295
(Thunder in distance)

10
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:22,467
Westchester, New York 1944

11
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:36,231
(Clock ticking)

12
00:02:41,611 --> 00:02:42,654
(Plates rattling)

13
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:51,454
Mother, what are you...

14
00:02:52,121 --> 00:02:53,957
I thought you were a burglar.

15
00:02:54,582 --> 00:02:57,669
I didn't mean to scare you darling,
I was just getting a snack.

16
00:02:57,752 --> 00:02:59,087
Go back to bed.

17
00:03:00,505 --> 00:03:01,881
What's the matter?

18
00:03:02,632 --> 00:03:04,217
Go on, back to bed.

19
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:08,721
I'll make you a hot chocolate.

20
00:03:09,347 --> 00:03:10,848
Who are you?

21
00:03:15,103 --> 00:03:17,105
And what have you done with my mother?

22
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,150
(Charles' Mentally speaking) **My mother has
never set foot in this kitchen in her life.**

23
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:25,029
**And she certainly wouldn't have made me
hot chocolate.**

24
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,616
**Unless she kept ordering me to do it.**

25
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:49,053
You're not scared of me?

26
00:03:49,053 --> 00:03:52,390
I always believed I couldn't be the
only one in the world.

27
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,101
The only person who is...

28
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:56,936
...different.

29
00:03:58,054 --> 00:04:02,108
And here you are... ,
Charles Xavier.

30
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:06,279
Raven.

31
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,609
You're hungry, and alone?
Take whatever you want.

32
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:13,953
We've got lots of food,
you don't have to steal.

33
00:04:14,538 --> 00:04:16,247
In fact...

34
00:04:17,249 --> 00:04:20,418
...you never have to steal again.

35
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,804
(Music playing on Victrola)

36
00:04:33,181 --> 00:04:35,767
Understand this, Eric.

37
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:39,479
These Nazi's I'm not like them.

38
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,736
Genes are the key, yes?

39
00:04:47,195 --> 00:04:49,072
But their goals?

40
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:54,285
Blue eyes, Blonde hair, pathetic.

41
00:04:55,954 --> 00:04:56,996
Mmm.

42
00:04:59,374 --> 00:05:01,000
Eat the chocolate.

43
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,586
It's good.

44
00:05:04,087 --> 00:05:05,255
Want some?

45
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,259
I want to see my mama.

46
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:21,980
Genes are the keys that unlocks
the door to a new age, Erik.

47
00:05:22,438 --> 00:05:25,775
A new future for mankind.

48
00:05:26,109 --> 00:05:27,819
Evolution.

49
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,322
You know what I'm talking about?

50
00:05:32,615 --> 00:05:36,160
It's a simple thing I ask of you.

51
00:05:36,327 --> 00:05:41,791
A little coin is nothing compared to a big gate.

52
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:43,710
Is it.

53
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:55,179
Yes.

54
00:05:58,808 --> 00:06:01,060
I've tried, Herr Doctor.

55
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,522
I can't...I don't...

56
00:06:05,648 --> 00:06:07,191
It's impossible.

57
00:06:09,485 --> 00:06:15,116
The only thing I can say for the Nazi's.
is their methods seem to produce results.

58
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:16,993
(Shaw making tsking sounds)

59
00:06:17,702 --> 00:06:19,662
I'm sorry, Erik.

60
00:06:20,955 --> 00:06:21,998
(Bell rings)

61
00:06:30,465 --> 00:06:31,507
Mama.

62
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,052
My darling.
(Door slams)

63
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,429
How are you?

64
00:06:40,183 --> 00:06:42,101
Here's what we're going to do.

65
00:06:42,852 --> 00:06:45,146
I'm going to count to three.

66
00:06:46,064 --> 00:06:49,192
And you're going to move the coin.

67
00:06:49,651 --> 00:06:54,364
You don't move the coin,
I pull the trigger.

68
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:58,076
Understand?

69
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,453
One.

70
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:02,664
Mama.

71
00:07:02,664 --> 00:07:04,165
You can do it.

72
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:10,338
Two.

73
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,968
Everything is good.

74
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,514
(Panting)

75
00:07:25,395 --> 00:07:26,896
Mother: Everything is good.

76
00:07:28,898 --> 00:07:30,483
Everything is good.

77
00:07:31,109 --> 00:07:32,151
Three.

78
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:35,780
(Gun shot)
(Bullet casing rattles on desk)

79
00:07:49,586 --> 00:07:50,628
(Metal groaning)

80
00:07:53,381 --> 00:07:55,466
Yes, wonderful!

81
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,428
(Roars with rage)

82
00:08:05,435 --> 00:08:06,477
Excellent.

83
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:12,734
(Metal rattling)

84
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:35,757
Noooo.

85
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:44,432
(Starts crying)

86
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:48,436
(Quietly sobbing)

87
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,815
Outstanding, Erik.

88
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:57,779
So we unlocked your gift with anger.

89
00:08:58,696 --> 00:09:02,492
Anger and pain.

90
00:09:04,536 --> 00:09:06,037
Shaw: You and me.

91
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:10,166
We're going to have a lot of fun together.

92
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:00,800
Geneva, Switzerland - 1962

93
00:10:13,354 --> 00:10:16,691
Oxford University, England

94
00:10:23,364 --> 00:10:25,408
Hetro-chromia.

95
00:10:27,452 --> 00:10:30,079
A gentlemen would at least offer
to buy me a drink first.

96
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,042
(Chuckles) Newman, a pint of bitter for me
and a brandy for the lady, please.

97
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:36,461
- How did you know that?
- Lucky guess.

98
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:38,338
The name's, Xavier,
Charles Xavier.

99
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:39,547
- How do you do...
- Amy.

100
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,633
Hetrochromia, is in reference to your eyes,

101
00:10:41,716 --> 00:10:44,093
which I have to say are stunning.

102
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,554
One green, one blue. It's a mutation.

103
00:10:46,596 --> 00:10:48,097
It's a very groovy mutation.

104
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:51,559
I've got news for you, Amy.
You are a mutant.

105
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:54,896
First you proposition a girl,
and then you call her, deformed.

106
00:10:55,104 --> 00:10:57,315
How is that seduction tactic working for you?

107
00:10:57,398 --> 00:10:58,900
I'll tell you in the morning.

108
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,694
No, seriously though, you mustnâ€™t knock it.

109
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,571
Mutation's go from single cell organisms

110
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:07,033
to being the dominate form of
reproductive life, on this planet.

111
00:11:07,116 --> 00:11:10,245
Infinite forms of variations with each generation.

112
00:11:10,411 --> 00:11:13,540
All through, mutation.

113
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,709
Then let's reclaim that word.

114
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:22,882
- Mutant, and proud.
- Chin, chin, hey.

115
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,592
Hi, I guess I have to buy my own drink.

116
00:11:24,676 --> 00:11:25,927
I'm sorry, one cola.

117
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:27,303
Charles here was just telling me that I'm

118
00:11:27,303 --> 00:11:29,514
like one of the first sea creatures that grew legs.

119
00:11:29,514 --> 00:11:30,932
Tiny bit sexier.

120
00:11:31,474 --> 00:11:33,351
I'm sorry, this is my sister, Raven.

121
00:11:34,435 --> 00:11:37,522
- Hi, Amy.
- And what do you study?

122
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:39,941
- Waitressing.
- Aah.

123
00:11:42,944 --> 00:11:44,737
Oh look, you have hetero-chromia too!

124
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:47,031
- Say, what?
- Look at her eye..

125
00:11:49,868 --> 00:11:52,495
(Clears throat)
Right, Raven get your coat please.

126
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,164
Charles: Don't talk to me, you did
that on purpose.

127
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,541
- Raven: I did not!
- Charles: Yes you did!

128
00:11:56,624 --> 00:11:59,127
Raven: Why would I do it on purpose?
You know I can't control it sometimes.

129
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:00,297
Raven: When I'm stressed or tired..

130
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:02,297
Charles: You seem to be doing a perfectly
good job right now.

131
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,841
"Mutant and proud"

132
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:08,428
Why is it always the pretty mutations,
or invisible ones like yours.

133
00:12:08,553 --> 00:12:10,096
If you're a freak, better hide.

134
00:12:10,221 --> 00:12:12,098
You're being ridiculous!

135
00:12:12,223 --> 00:12:14,559
Look, I don't mean to
sound like an old fart.

136
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:19,230
- Which you are.     - Sometimes, but
we've talked about this, Raven.

137
00:12:19,731 --> 00:12:23,860
A small slip up is one thing.
A big one does not bear thinking about.

138
00:12:29,407 --> 00:12:31,743
"Mutant and proud"

139
00:12:34,245 --> 00:12:36,080
"Mutant and proud"?

140
00:12:47,091 --> 00:12:48,927
If only...

141
00:12:54,515 --> 00:12:56,851
- Would you date me?
- Of course I would.

142
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,895
Any young man would be lucky to have you.

143
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,272
- You're stunning!
- Looking like this?

144
00:13:01,397 --> 00:13:03,274
Like, you...what?

145
00:13:06,861 --> 00:13:07,987
Blue?

146
00:13:10,782 --> 00:13:13,576
- You're my oldest friend.
- I'm your only friend.

147
00:13:13,868 --> 00:13:15,495
Thank you for that.

148
00:13:15,912 --> 00:13:16,913
Well?

149
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,917
I'm incapable of thinking of you that way,
You...I feel responsible for you.

150
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:24,128
Anything else would just feel...wrong.

151
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,006
- But what if you didn't know me?
- Unfortunately I do know you.

152
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:30,426
I don't know what's got into you lately?
You're awfully concerned with your looks.

153
00:13:35,223 --> 00:13:36,867
I'm sleepy.
Will you read to me?

154
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:39,311
I can't, I have my thesis coming up, I have to study.

155
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:42,189
Well fine, read about your thesis
it always sends me right off.

156
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:46,268
To Homo neanderthalensis,
his mutant cousin Homo sapiens,

157
00:13:46,268 --> 00:13:48,361
was an aberration.

158
00:13:48,486 --> 00:13:51,447
Charles: Peaceful co-habitation, if ever it existed,

159
00:13:51,447 --> 00:13:52,949
was short lived.

160
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:56,795
Records show, without exception that the
arrival of the mutated human species

161
00:13:56,795 --> 00:14:02,584
in any region was followed by the immediate
extinction of their less evolved kin.

162
00:14:08,023 --> 00:14:11,759
Man: Possession of this gold is illegal.

163
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,803
I should inform the police.

164
00:14:14,137 --> 00:14:15,889
Let's not play this game.

165
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,974
Where did you get it?

166
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,976
A friend.

167
00:14:19,976 --> 00:14:22,353
He recommended your bank, most highly.

168
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,523
Man: I see.

169
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,692
Do you know our terms, sir?

170
00:14:28,318 --> 00:14:29,360
Yes.

171
00:14:30,612 --> 00:14:33,114
And you should know mine.

172
00:14:35,617 --> 00:14:38,786
This gold is what remains of my people.

173
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:42,582
Melted from their possessions.

174
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,293
Torn from their teeth.

175
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:48,630
And you're going to help me find
the bastards responsible for it.

176
00:14:49,714 --> 00:14:51,507
(Tsking)

177
00:14:53,843 --> 00:14:55,637
Don't touch that alarm.

178
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,224
I want Schmidt.

179
00:15:01,017 --> 00:15:02,393
Klaus Schmidt.

180
00:15:02,644 --> 00:15:03,686
Where is he?

181
00:15:03,811 --> 00:15:06,147
Out clients don't provide addresses.
We're not...

182
00:15:06,147 --> 00:15:07,982
Not that sort of bank?

183
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:17,867
Metal fillings, eh?

184
00:15:17,867 --> 00:15:18,910
Not gold.

185
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,162
Worried someone might steal them?

186
00:15:21,162 --> 00:15:24,999
Argentina!
Schmidt is in Argentina!

187
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,545
Villa Gesell.
Please, please!

188
00:15:38,263 --> 00:15:41,140
(Panting hard)

189
00:15:45,186 --> 00:15:46,229
Thank you.

190
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:53,361
I would love to kill you.

191
00:15:57,282 --> 00:15:59,284
So, mark my words.

192
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:02,662
If you warn anyone I'm coming,

193
00:16:04,205 --> 00:16:05,623
I will find you.

194
00:16:09,252 --> 00:16:13,214
Las Vegas, Nevada

195
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:20,263
Lavene: Another day at the office.

196
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:22,682
Moira: Is that Colonel Hendry?

197
00:16:23,099 --> 00:16:25,310
- Lavene: The NATO guy?
- Yeah.

198
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,896
Lavene: Yes it is.

199
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,522
Lavene: 'Cause that's three mob bosses,,

200
00:16:29,647 --> 00:16:32,609
the Italian ambassador
and the CEO of Lockheed.

201
00:16:32,901 --> 00:16:37,322
They can't all be communists.
This Hellfire club's gotta be something else.

202
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:38,406
(Lavene laughs)

203
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:43,119
Lavene: Do you see that?
Hello, girls!

204
00:16:43,494 --> 00:16:45,955
Lavene: Wow, very nice.

205
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,541
Wha...what are you doing?

206
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:51,336
Here's things that the CIA didn't give me.

207
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:52,629
Stay put.

208
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,467
- Colonel Hendry?
- Yes, ma'am.

209
00:16:57,592 --> 00:17:00,637
Emma Frost,
Sebastian Shaw's associate.

210
00:17:01,596 --> 00:17:03,890
And where is, Mr. Shaw?

211
00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:08,478
We're having a party, and here's
the entertainment. Come with me.

212
00:17:08,978 --> 00:17:10,021
(Palisades Park by Freddy Cannon )

213
00:17:10,021 --> 00:17:12,941
# Down, like a roller coaster #

214
00:17:12,941 --> 00:17:14,359
# Back like a loop-the-loop #

215
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:17,737
# And around like a merry-go-round #

216
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:20,240
# We ate and ate at a hot dog stand #

217
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,034
# We danced around to a rockin' band #

218
00:17:23,034 --> 00:17:26,746
# And when I could, I gave that girl a hug #

219
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:29,290
# In the tunnel of love #

220
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,626
# You'll never know how great a kiss can feel #

221
00:17:31,626 --> 00:17:34,337
# When you stop at the top of a Ferris wheel #

222
00:17:34,337 --> 00:17:38,675
# When I fell in love, down at Palisades Park #

223
00:17:47,642 --> 00:17:49,227
Man: Hello beautiful, how are you?

224
00:17:49,352 --> 00:17:51,646
Hey baby, you want to find a quiet place?

225
00:17:51,813 --> 00:17:55,191
I'm so sorry.
I've been booked by Colonel Hendry.

226
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,820
Excuse me.

227
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,238
# We ate and ate at a hot dog stand #

228
00:18:00,238 --> 00:18:03,241
# We danced around to a rockin' band #

229
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:07,078
# And when I could, I gave that girl a hug #

230
00:18:07,078 --> 00:18:09,414
# In the tunnel of love #

231
00:18:09,414 --> 00:18:11,666
# You'll never know how great a kiss can feel #

232
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:12,709
# When you stop at the.... #

233
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:16,963
(Music playing on record player)

234
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,677
- Are you sure we can't get you a refill, Bob?
- Bob: No.

235
00:18:23,261 --> 00:18:28,308
So, I hear you blocked the proposal
to position Jupiter missiles in Turkey.

236
00:18:30,351 --> 00:18:34,439
- I expect you'll reconsider.
- Bob: We've had this conversation.

237
00:18:34,564 --> 00:18:38,401
You put our nukes in Turkey,
or anywhere that close to Russia,

238
00:18:38,568 --> 00:18:42,113
and you're looking at war.
Nuclear war.

239
00:18:45,742 --> 00:18:48,536
(Click and whirling sound)

240
00:19:15,063 --> 00:19:18,816
I don't ask for favors, Colonel.
I express my expectations.

241
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:26,866
So, let me say it again.
I expect you'll reconsider.

242
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:32,705
The only thing I will reconsider, is having
another glass of that delicious champagne.

243
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,715
(Sound of wind whistling)

244
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:47,929
Bob: What the hell did you put in my drink?

245
00:19:56,145 --> 00:19:57,188
(Grunts, loud thud)

246
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,868
Frost: **You're thinking of running, hiding?
We'd find you, Hendry.**

247
00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:13,037
**There's not a fortress in the world
that could keep us out.**

248
00:20:29,846 --> 00:20:32,932
Shaw: Magnificent, isn't she, Bob?

249
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:37,937
Genetic mutation, the evolution of a human genome.

250
00:20:38,146 --> 00:20:39,439
Where's Azazel?

251
00:20:40,023 --> 00:20:44,444
(High pitched whistle)

252
00:20:45,862 --> 00:20:47,530
Shaw: Ah, we don't want
the Colonel to be late.

253
00:20:51,534 --> 00:20:52,952
Come here.

254
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,541
Man: Missiles in Turkey send a very clear message.

255
00:20:58,541 --> 00:20:59,959
We ever decided to fire them,

256
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,587
the Russian early warning system won't
even have time to kick in.

257
00:21:02,587 --> 00:21:04,255
McCone: This better be important, MacTaggert

258
00:21:04,255 --> 00:21:05,798
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

259
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:09,052
You smoking them funny cigarettes?
People don't disappear.

260
00:21:09,219 --> 00:21:12,222
Colonel Hendry was there.
He was there McCone, in the Hellfire club.

261
00:21:12,347 --> 00:21:13,848
Colonel Hendry?

262
00:21:14,015 --> 00:21:17,810
I agree with you, General.
I've reconsidered my position.

263
00:21:17,894 --> 00:21:21,105
And I now believe that we should put
Jupiter Missiles in Turkey.

264
00:21:21,272 --> 00:21:22,273
Colonel Hendry is here.

265
00:21:22,357 --> 00:21:26,110
So, unless he magically traveled
3,000 miles in the last ten minutes,

266
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,072
Listen to me, I suggest that you stop
wasting my time.

267
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:31,991
Looks like Hendry wants to start
World War III.

268
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:33,910
I have better things to deal with right now, MacTaggert.

269
00:21:34,244 --> 00:21:35,453
Sir, I...!

270
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,331
Have you lost your mind?

271
00:21:38,915 --> 00:21:40,833
So, now what?

272
00:21:42,293 --> 00:21:44,921
We find an expert on Genetic Mutation.

273
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:49,884
Man announcing: Professor of genetics,
Charles Francis Xavier.

274
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:55,181
Raven: So, how does it feel to be a professor?

275
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:56,181
Charles: Well, don't call me that. 

276
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,626
You don't get to be called a Professor until
you actually have a teaching position.

277
00:21:58,626 --> 00:22:00,009
Raven: I know, but it suits you.

278
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:01,479
Charles: No, don't say that, do say
"Lets go have a drink".

279
00:22:01,604 --> 00:22:03,398
- Raven: Let's go have a drink.
- Charles: Wonderful!

280
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:19,706
Villa Gesell, Argentina

281
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:34,470
- Good evening, my friends!
- Good evening!

282
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,722
- Hot, no?
- Yes...

283
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:37,682
One beer, please.

284
00:22:44,814 --> 00:22:46,941
(Glass filling)

285
00:23:01,331 --> 00:23:02,582
German beer.

286
00:23:02,832 --> 00:23:03,875
Of course.

287
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:07,670
Yes, it's Bitburger.
You like it?

288
00:23:13,968 --> 00:23:15,345
The best.

289
00:23:20,642 --> 00:23:22,852
What brings you to Argentina?

290
00:23:24,938 --> 00:23:28,483
The climate, I'm a pig farmer.

291
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,573
Tailor, since I was a boy.

292
00:23:36,032 --> 00:23:38,576
My father made the finest
suits in DÃ¼sseldorf.

293
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:41,788
My parents were from DÃ¼sseldorf.

294
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:43,373
- Ah.
- Yeah.

295
00:23:43,706 --> 00:23:44,916
What was their name?

296
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,793
They didn't have a name.

297
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:50,505
It was taken away from them.

298
00:23:50,964 --> 00:23:52,340
By pig farmers,...
(Glass clinks)

299
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:54,926
...and tailors.
(Glass clinks)

300
00:24:23,997 --> 00:24:25,707
Erik: Blood and honor.

301
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,876
Which would you care to shed first?

302
00:24:28,084 --> 00:24:30,086
We were under orders.

303
00:24:30,086 --> 00:24:31,212
Blood then.

304
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:32,881
(Screams in pain)

305
00:24:33,923 --> 00:24:35,049
Freeze, asshole.

306
00:24:35,466 --> 00:24:36,968
Tailor: Come on, shoot.

307
00:24:51,232 --> 00:24:52,275
(Screams)

308
00:24:53,818 --> 00:24:56,321
(Whimpers in pain)

309
00:24:57,155 --> 00:24:59,532
Who...what are you?

310
00:25:02,118 --> 00:25:04,621
Let's just say I'm Frankenstein's monster.

311
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,968
I'm looking for my creator.

312
00:25:23,973 --> 00:25:29,854
Crowd chanting: Drink, drink, drink!

313
00:25:30,688 --> 00:25:31,731
(Crowd cheers)

314
00:25:33,983 --> 00:25:36,027
(Triumphantly roars)

315
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:41,616
(Laughs)

316
00:25:41,616 --> 00:25:43,618
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

317
00:25:44,661 --> 00:25:47,580
I need another drink, and you
need another cola.

318
00:25:51,268 --> 00:25:52,860
Congratulations, Professor!

319
00:25:52,868 --> 00:25:55,000
Thank you very much, it's much
harder than it looks, actually...

320
00:25:55,005 --> 00:25:57,466
- No, on your presentation.
- You knew my presentation?

321
00:25:57,466 --> 00:25:59,005
How nice of you, thank you very much.

322
00:25:59,005 --> 00:26:00,877
- Moira MacTaggert.
- Charles Xavier.

323
00:26:00,877 --> 00:26:01,970
Do you have a minute?

324
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:06,916
For a pretty little beam with a
mutated MCR-1 gene, I have five.

325
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:11,229
I say, MCR-1, you would say,
golden hair.

326
00:26:11,396 --> 00:26:15,124
It's a mutation, it's a very groovy mutation.

327
00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:19,696
Mutation you know, took us from single
celled organisms,

328
00:26:19,863 --> 00:26:21,614
to the dominate form...

329
00:26:21,739 --> 00:26:22,739
You know what, this...

330
00:26:22,739 --> 00:26:25,910
...routine may go over great with the
co-eds, but I'm here on business.

331
00:26:26,202 --> 00:26:28,663
- What?
- I really need your help.

332
00:26:29,414 --> 00:26:30,707
All right.

333
00:26:30,832 --> 00:26:34,168
The kind of mutations that you were
talking about in your thesis.

334
00:26:34,335 --> 00:26:36,796
I need to know if they may have already happened.

335
00:26:38,047 --> 00:26:40,008
In people alive today.

336
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:45,847
(No sound)

337
00:26:51,352 --> 00:26:52,604
Professor?

338
00:26:54,731 --> 00:26:57,734
I think we should just talk when you're sober.
Do you have any time tomorrow?

339
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:03,239
Something tells me, you already know
the answer to your question.

340
00:27:05,283 --> 00:27:09,370
This is very important to me.
And if I can help you, I will do my utmost.

341
00:27:10,246 --> 00:27:11,122
Thank you.

342
00:27:11,372 --> 00:27:14,500
Miami, Florida

343
00:27:14,751 --> 00:27:18,379
- Shaw: Still drinking champagne, Bob?
- Bob: I will pass.

344
00:27:19,172 --> 00:27:22,133
Okay, well so much for the pleasantries.

345
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:26,137
I was wondering, who you told
about our little arrangement?

346
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:27,805
No one.

347
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,518
- He's telling the truth.
- Shaw: Good.

348
00:27:32,644 --> 00:27:36,689
Well I guess we're done here.
Let's wrap things up, shall we?

349
00:27:40,735 --> 00:27:43,446
Bob: Well I knew better than to trust you.

350
00:27:44,197 --> 00:27:47,659
Now you let me walk out of here
with my money.

351
00:27:47,659 --> 00:27:51,746
Or I will pull this pin and we all die.

352
00:27:52,622 --> 00:27:55,625
Go ahead, pull it.

353
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:57,293
I'll do it, I swear to god.

354
00:28:07,095 --> 00:28:08,513
No you won't.

355
00:28:13,643 --> 00:28:14,936
But I will.

356
00:28:28,157 --> 00:28:29,367
You're one of them?

357
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:33,288
Shaw: Very astute of you, Colonel Hendry.
You want to guess what I can do?

358
00:28:33,413 --> 00:28:36,291
I've got the power to absorb energy.
It keeps me young.

359
00:28:36,457 --> 00:28:37,959
That's the boring part.

360
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:41,713
The fun stuff is what I can do with it
once I got it.

361
00:28:48,052 --> 00:28:52,132
The advent of the nuclear age,
may have accelerated the mutation process.

362
00:28:52,132 --> 00:28:57,353
Individual's with extraordinary abilities may
already be among us.

363
00:28:57,704 --> 00:28:58,830
Thank you very much.

364
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,483
MacTaggert, you really think that some crackpot scientist,

365
00:29:01,483 --> 00:29:05,570
is going to make me believe in sparkly dames
and vanishing men?

366
00:29:05,695 --> 00:29:08,448
You just brought yourself a one way ticket
back to the typing pool.

367
00:29:08,698 --> 00:29:10,158
This meeting is over.

368
00:29:10,325 --> 00:29:12,744
Uh, please sit down agent, MacTaggert.

369
00:29:13,703 --> 00:29:15,847
I didn't really expect you to believe me.

370
00:29:15,847 --> 00:29:17,849
Given that all you could think about during my presentation,

371
00:29:17,849 --> 00:29:20,420
was what sort of pie they were serving in the commissary.

372
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,696
It's apple pecan.

373
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,004
I haven't been entirely honest with you, luv, I'm sorry.

374
00:29:26,007 --> 00:29:30,470
You see, one of the many spectacular
things my mutation allows me to do.

375
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,472
Is that I can read your mind.

376
00:29:32,931 --> 00:29:34,915
I've seen this before in a magic show.

377
00:29:34,915 --> 00:29:38,978
Are you going to ask us to think of a number
between one and ten now?

378
00:29:39,312 --> 00:29:40,630
No, Agent Stryker. 

379
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:44,333
Although I could ask you about your son
William who you were thinking about,

380
00:29:44,338 --> 00:29:45,109
which is very nice.

381
00:29:45,235 --> 00:29:47,320
But I think I'd rather ask you
about the Jupiter...

382
00:29:47,445 --> 00:29:50,031
...missiles America are currently placing in Turkey.

383
00:29:51,908 --> 00:29:54,619
He's a goddamn spy!
You brought a goddamn spy!

384
00:29:54,744 --> 00:29:56,663
I did not, I would never bring one here!

385
00:30:15,723 --> 00:30:17,392
How's that for a magic trick?

386
00:30:20,562 --> 00:30:22,897
Best I've ever seen.

387
00:30:23,481 --> 00:30:24,941
I want them out of here.

388
00:30:25,108 --> 00:30:28,278
And lock down until I can figure out
what to do.

389
00:30:29,237 --> 00:30:33,533
My facility is off site. I'll take them.

390
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:35,994
I can't believe this.

391
00:30:36,077 --> 00:30:38,438
You'd think the director of the CIA
would have a little more composure.

392
00:30:38,438 --> 00:30:40,039
We should be going after Shaw right now, but...

393
00:30:40,164 --> 00:30:42,166
...instead he's up there worrying about the wrong mutants.

394
00:30:42,417 --> 00:30:43,501
What are we doing to do, Lavene?

395
00:30:44,127 --> 00:30:47,130
Lavene?
Lavene, what's wrong with you?

396
00:30:49,507 --> 00:30:50,844
Charles: **Absolutely nothing,

397
00:30:50,847 --> 00:30:53,344
I've just frozen him for the
moment because I'd like to talk to you.**

398
00:30:53,428 --> 00:30:54,637
**It's good, isn't it?**

399
00:30:54,637 --> 00:30:57,557
**I'm as interested in this,
Sebastian Shaw as you are,**

400
00:30:57,557 --> 00:31:00,685
**...and if you still want my help, meet me on
the third floor of the parking garage.**

401
00:31:01,936 --> 00:31:04,589
Man in Black: I've always known that
there were people like you out there.

402
00:31:04,589 --> 00:31:08,018
I've been the laughing stock of
this agency for years but I knew it.

403
00:31:08,021 --> 00:31:09,165
You're going to love my facility.

404
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:11,062
- Charles: That's going to have to wait.
- Man in Black: Why?

405
00:31:11,087 --> 00:31:13,206
Agent MacTaggert has to lead us to Sebastian Shaw,

406
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:15,825
and if we don't move now apparently
we're going to loose him.

407
00:31:15,992 --> 00:31:16,501
What?

408
00:31:16,506 --> 00:31:19,996
Not only can he read minds,
he can communicate with them as well.

409
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,873
Moria and I have just had a lovely conversation.

410
00:31:21,998 --> 00:31:23,917
- Yes, we did.
- That is incredible!

411
00:31:24,167 --> 00:31:25,210
(Charles chuckles)

412
00:31:25,251 --> 00:31:28,504
But I cannot take you anywhere else,
without permission from upstairs.

413
00:31:28,588 --> 00:31:30,757
- Would you like to see one more magic trick?
- Okay.

414
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,467
- Get in the car.
- Good idea.

415
00:31:53,738 --> 00:31:54,989
Herr Doctor...

416
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:01,371
Little Erik Lehnsherr.

417
00:32:01,621 --> 00:32:03,122
He's here to kill you.

418
00:32:04,624 --> 00:32:05,959
(Screeching sound)

419
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:12,840
What kind of greeting is that?

420
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:17,011
...after all these years.

421
00:32:17,971 --> 00:32:19,013
(Gun shot)

422
00:32:26,729 --> 00:32:29,190
Emma... (tsking sound)

423
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,234
We don't harm our own kind.

424
00:32:31,234 --> 00:32:32,777
(Boat horn blaring)

425
00:32:33,069 --> 00:32:35,363
Shaw: Ah, now it's a party.

426
00:32:36,406 --> 00:32:41,035
(Man on bullhorn) This is the US Coast guard.
Do not attempt to move your vessel.

427
00:32:41,202 --> 00:32:42,996
Stay where you are.

428
00:32:49,168 --> 00:32:50,503
They have a telepath.

429
00:32:54,507 --> 00:32:55,800
I've lost, Shaw!

430
00:32:56,134 --> 00:32:57,844
I've lost, I've lost, Shaw.

431
00:32:57,844 --> 00:33:00,763
There, there's something blocking me.
This has never happened to me before.

432
00:33:00,763 --> 00:33:02,557
I think there's someone like
me on that ship.

433
00:33:02,724 --> 00:33:05,518
- Like you?
- I'm sorry, a telepath.

434
00:33:06,185 --> 00:33:08,646
This is incredible, I can actually feel
her inside my mind.

435
00:33:08,646 --> 00:33:10,565
I'm very sorry, but I don't think I'm
going to be much help to you tonight.

436
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:11,691
You're on your own.

437
00:33:19,866 --> 00:33:20,909
(Winds whistling)

438
00:33:25,455 --> 00:33:26,956
- Oh my god.
- Moria: Jesus.

439
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,461
Man in Black: Get inside.

440
00:33:35,673 --> 00:33:36,716
(Chains rattle)

441
00:33:37,717 --> 00:33:39,052
Stop, stop, stop!

442
00:33:39,844 --> 00:33:42,764
Charles!
You okay?

443
00:33:42,889 --> 00:33:44,390
There's someone else out there.

444
00:33:48,353 --> 00:33:49,646
There!

445
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:52,440
(Anchor creaks)

446
00:33:52,524 --> 00:33:53,733
Time to go.

447
00:34:48,955 --> 00:34:50,331
Charles: Let go!

448
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,710
Charles: You got to let it go!

449
00:34:53,793 --> 00:34:55,628
You've got help him...there's
someone in the water, help him!

450
00:34:55,712 --> 00:34:59,173
Let it go!
You have to let it go!

451
00:35:18,985 --> 00:35:22,405
Charles: **You can't, you'll drown.
You have to let go.**

452
00:35:22,488 --> 00:35:25,200
**I know what this means to you
but you're going to die.**

453
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:29,537
**Please, Erik, calm your mind.**

454
00:35:40,965 --> 00:35:42,508
Erik: Get off of me, get off!

455
00:35:42,634 --> 00:35:44,844
Calm down, please.
We're here!

456
00:35:44,969 --> 00:35:47,196
- Who are you?
-  My name's Charles Xavier.

457
00:35:47,196 --> 00:35:50,600
You were in my head.
How did you do that?

458
00:35:50,725 --> 00:35:54,562
You have your tricks, I have mine.
I'm like you, just calm your mind.

459
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,777
- I thought I was alone.
- You're not alone.

460
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,615
Erik, you're not alone.

461
00:36:08,451 --> 00:36:12,038
Covert CIA Research Base

462
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,012
Man in Black: Welcome to my facility.

463
00:36:28,888 --> 00:36:30,431
My mission has been to investigate the

464
00:36:30,515 --> 00:36:33,718
application of paranormal powers
for military defense.

465
00:36:33,718 --> 00:36:35,436
Or offense.

466
00:36:35,728 --> 00:36:38,815
This guy, Shaw, Schmidt, whatever
you want to call him.

467
00:36:38,982 --> 00:36:40,650
He's working with the Russians.

468
00:36:40,775 --> 00:36:42,018
We might need your help to stop him.

469
00:36:42,018 --> 00:36:43,319
Marvelous.

470
00:36:43,444 --> 00:36:46,155
So we're to be the CIA's new
mutant division, yes?

471
00:36:47,365 --> 00:36:48,575
Something like that.

472
00:36:52,245 --> 00:36:56,499
Hank: It's a supersonic. The most
advanced plane ever built.

473
00:36:57,792 --> 00:37:00,462
You should see it in real life.
It's incredible.

474
00:37:00,462 --> 00:37:04,841
Hank, these are the special new recruits I
was telling you about.

475
00:37:04,966 --> 00:37:07,811
This is, Hank McCoy,
One of our most talented young researchers.

476
00:37:07,811 --> 00:37:11,448
How wonderful, another mutant.
Already here.

477
00:37:11,448 --> 00:37:14,559
- Why didn't you say?
- Say what?

478
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,395
Because you don't know.

479
00:37:18,188 --> 00:37:21,316
I am so, so terribly sorry!

480
00:37:23,985 --> 00:37:25,111
Hank?

481
00:37:25,236 --> 00:37:27,238
You didn't ask, so I didn't tell.

482
00:37:27,739 --> 00:37:31,159
So your mutation's what?
You're super smart?

483
00:37:31,284 --> 00:37:34,495
Charles: I'll say, Hank here graduated
honors at the age of fifteen.

484
00:37:35,288 --> 00:37:37,415
I wish that's all it was.

485
00:37:37,582 --> 00:37:41,127
You're among friends now, Hank.
You could show off.

486
00:37:53,181 --> 00:37:54,224
(Charles laughs with joy)

487
00:37:57,143 --> 00:37:58,353
Splendid.

488
00:38:04,108 --> 00:38:06,319
- Sorry.
- Charles: Yes, yes.

489
00:38:09,864 --> 00:38:10,907
(All laugh)

490
00:38:20,708 --> 00:38:23,878
- You're amazing.
- Really?

491
00:38:29,217 --> 00:38:32,679
TV Announcer: The presence of U.S. missiles
in Turkey represents an unprecedented threat

492
00:38:32,762 --> 00:38:34,430
to the people of the Soviet Union.

493
00:38:34,556 --> 00:38:38,226
Warned Russian Mister Gromeko, earlier today

494
00:38:38,476 --> 00:38:43,731
But he was quick to insist the Russians would 
not be the first to initiate any military action.

495
00:38:43,898 --> 00:38:46,192
Yeah, we'll fix that as soon as
we get to Russia.

496
00:38:46,818 --> 00:38:50,989
- Unless the CIA finds us first.
- I'll take care of them too.

497
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:57,287
If that telepath gets inside your head,
he won't be as much fun as I am.

498
00:38:57,745 --> 00:38:59,664
Already in hand, my love.

499
00:39:09,382 --> 00:39:10,800
Shaw: The Russians...

500
00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:14,679
...made me this.

501
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:20,685
So, what am I thinking?

502
00:39:30,195 --> 00:39:31,613
I don't know.

503
00:39:34,365 --> 00:39:38,328
I was thinking that you are the most
exquisite thing I've ever seen in my life.

504
00:39:42,457 --> 00:39:44,876
And that this needs ice.
(Taps glass)

505
00:39:45,877 --> 00:39:47,170
Shaw: Fetch me some.

506
00:39:47,253 --> 00:39:48,671
There's a good girl.

507
00:39:56,638 --> 00:39:59,098
(Radar pinging)

508
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,493
Hank: I...I promised myself I'd find a cure.
Ever since I was a little boy.

509
00:40:18,618 --> 00:40:22,372
You have no idea what I'd give to feel...

510
00:40:22,914 --> 00:40:24,707
- ...normal.
- Normal.

511
00:40:29,254 --> 00:40:31,548
Charles has never understood.

512
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,218
He's different, but he's never had to hide.

513
00:40:35,927 --> 00:40:40,139
Hank this serum that you're making,
it doesn't affect abilities, right?

514
00:40:40,181 --> 00:40:42,934
Just appearance.
Normalizes it.

515
00:40:43,101 --> 00:40:44,269
Yeah.

516
00:40:45,061 --> 00:40:46,813
Do you think it would work on me?

517
00:40:48,147 --> 00:40:50,483
I can look into it, if you'd like.

518
00:40:50,483 --> 00:40:54,112
That's the least I can do after asking you to
come down here with such a weird request.

519
00:40:54,279 --> 00:40:55,029
I have to admit,

520
00:40:55,113 --> 00:40:57,782
usually when guys ask me out they're
not after my blood.

521
00:40:58,491 --> 00:41:04,372
S..sorry, I didn't intend to be forward.
I was just...I was excited.

522
00:41:04,497 --> 00:41:06,624
You know, the nature of your mutation.

523
00:41:06,749 --> 00:41:09,961
If any genes hold the key to
changing appearance, it's yours.

524
00:41:10,086 --> 00:41:14,507
Hank, you aren't being forward,
that's kinda what I meant.

525
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:20,513
- No, but I'm just sorry if you thought I was.
- And I'm sorry that you weren't.

526
00:41:22,015 --> 00:41:24,475
Go ahead, take the blood.

527
00:41:36,362 --> 00:41:38,156
Sorry, did I hurt you?

528
00:41:40,617 --> 00:41:41,784
Kinky!

529
00:41:43,745 --> 00:41:49,500
By the way, if I looked like you,
I wouldn't change a thing.

530
00:42:16,069 --> 00:42:20,281
Charles: What I know about you, I'm
surprised you've managed to stay this long.

531
00:42:21,783 --> 00:42:25,286
- What do you know about me?
- Everything.

532
00:42:25,537 --> 00:42:27,539
Then you know to stay out of my head.

533
00:42:27,664 --> 00:42:31,209
I'm sorry Erik, but I've seen what
Shaw did to you.

534
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:35,129
I felt your agony.

535
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,175
I can help you.

536
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,763
(Tiredly exhales)

537
00:42:45,765 --> 00:42:47,225
I don't need your help.

538
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:49,435
Charles: Don't kid yourself.
You needed my help last night.

539
00:42:49,561 --> 00:42:51,729
It's not just me you're walking away from.

540
00:42:52,438 --> 00:42:56,609
Here you have the chance to be part of
something much bigger than yourself.

541
00:42:59,153 --> 00:43:02,115
I won't stop you leaving, I could.

542
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:06,744
But I won't.

543
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:12,333
Charles: Shaw's got friends.

544
00:43:13,042 --> 00:43:14,669
Charles: You could do with some.

545
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,761
Man in Black: Hank turned that
radar installation into a transmitter.

546
00:43:23,887 --> 00:43:26,014
It's designed to amplify brain waves,

547
00:43:26,139 --> 00:43:28,558
...so it could enhance your telepathic powers.

548
00:43:28,725 --> 00:43:31,144
Help us find other mutants for our division.

549
00:43:31,227 --> 00:43:33,271
What if they don't want to be found by you?

550
00:43:33,354 --> 00:43:34,856
Erik.

551
00:43:35,315 --> 00:43:36,858
You decided to stay.

552
00:43:39,402 --> 00:43:43,156
If a new species is being discovered,
it should be by its own kind.

553
00:43:43,448 --> 00:43:46,117
Charles and I find the mutants,
no suits.

554
00:43:46,284 --> 00:43:47,952
First of all, that's my machine out there.

555
00:43:48,077 --> 00:43:49,329
Second of all, and much more importantly,

556
00:43:49,454 --> 00:43:50,997
this is Charles' decision.

557
00:43:51,122 --> 00:43:54,000
Charles is fine with the CIA being involved.
Isn't that right?

558
00:43:55,752 --> 00:43:59,839
No, I'm sorry but, I'm with Erik.

559
00:43:59,923 --> 00:44:02,383
Charles: We'll find them alone.

560
00:44:03,885 --> 00:44:05,220
What if I say no?

561
00:44:06,387 --> 00:44:09,265
Then good luck using your installation without me.

562
00:44:21,653 --> 00:44:24,588
Hank: I call it, Cerebro.

563
00:44:25,573 --> 00:44:27,659
- Charles: Isn't that Spanish for "brain"?
- Hank: Yes.

564
00:44:28,201 --> 00:44:31,663
Okay so, the electrodes connect
Charles to the transmitter on the roof.

565
00:44:31,663 --> 00:44:33,540
And picks up a mutant.

566
00:44:33,665 --> 00:44:35,750
His brain sends a signal through a relay.

567
00:44:35,917 --> 00:44:38,461
And then the co-ordinates of their
location are printed out here.

568
00:44:38,795 --> 00:44:41,756
- You designed this?
- Yeah.

569
00:44:44,926 --> 00:44:48,429
- What an adorable lab rat you make, Charles.
- Don't spoil this for me, Erik.

570
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:51,558
I've been a lab rat, I know one when I see one.

571
00:44:51,683 --> 00:44:53,726
Okay, right...

572
00:44:54,227 --> 00:44:56,938
- Are you sure we can't shave your head?
- Don't touch my hair.

573
00:45:10,827 --> 00:45:11,870
(Computer clicking and whirling)

574
00:45:19,502 --> 00:45:20,545
(Gasps)

575
00:45:20,795 --> 00:45:21,838
(Pants)

576
00:45:32,348 --> 00:45:33,391
(Laughs)

577
00:45:41,441 --> 00:45:42,525
It's working!

578
00:45:43,484 --> 00:45:44,527
(Laughs with joy)

579
00:45:49,073 --> 00:45:52,493
# 60's dance music #

580
00:46:00,543 --> 00:46:03,379
With that Daddy-O, you get a private dance.

581
00:46:06,466 --> 00:46:09,510
(Glasses ring)
You cat's know it's double for both, right?

582
00:46:10,345 --> 00:46:12,680
No, that won't be necessary.
although I'm sure we...

583
00:46:12,805 --> 00:46:15,350
We were thinking, we'll show you ours,

584
00:46:15,558 --> 00:46:17,393
...if you show us yours.

585
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:19,854
Baby, that is not the way it works around here.

586
00:46:22,106 --> 00:46:25,485
- More tea, Vicar?
- Charles: Don't mind if I do.

587
00:46:27,946 --> 00:46:29,405
My turn.

588
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,209
(Wings fluttering)

589
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,801
How would you like a job, where you
get to keep your clothes on?

590
00:46:55,723 --> 00:46:58,017
- Where to fellas?
- Richmond, Virginia.

591
00:46:58,142 --> 00:47:01,145
Right, so you want the airport, the station, what?

592
00:47:01,229 --> 00:47:04,148
No we were rather hoping you would
take us all the way.

593
00:47:04,148 --> 00:47:05,900
That's a six hour drive.

594
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,694
That will give us plenty of time to talk.

595
00:47:12,365 --> 00:47:15,076
Warden: What the hell does the government
want with a guy like, Alex Summers?

596
00:47:15,243 --> 00:47:17,370
I hope you're not planning on putting him with others.

597
00:47:17,495 --> 00:47:21,124
First guy I ever met who actually
prefers solitary confinement.

598
00:47:31,259 --> 00:47:33,428
- Sean: Crazy, huh?
- Girl: What?

599
00:47:34,262 --> 00:47:36,472
Sean: You like fish, I like fish too.

600
00:47:36,472 --> 00:47:39,601
Maybe we should get a bite
some time and talk about it.

601
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:44,022
I'd rather go out with the fish.

602
00:47:50,195 --> 00:47:51,696
These fish?

603
00:48:10,715 --> 00:48:12,842
- Excuse me I'm Erik Lehnsherr.
- Charles Xavier.

604
00:48:12,926 --> 00:48:14,510
Go fuck yourselves.

605
00:48:34,531 --> 00:48:36,866
- There's nothing on radar?
- No.

606
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:38,618
- Sonar?
- Nyet.

607
00:48:39,869 --> 00:48:41,454
Then we have a problem.

608
00:48:50,338 --> 00:48:51,381
(Door sliding open)

609
00:49:00,431 --> 00:49:02,350
Beautiful, isn't it?

610
00:49:02,976 --> 00:49:07,689
The reason we exist.
We are the children of the atom, my love.

611
00:49:07,814 --> 00:49:09,482
We have a situation.

612
00:49:09,732 --> 00:49:11,526
The telepath...

613
00:49:11,609 --> 00:49:13,695
I shouldn't be able to feel him at this distance.

614
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,989
It's like his reach is...

615
00:49:16,364 --> 00:49:18,157
...amplified.

616
00:49:20,368 --> 00:49:22,412
They're recruiting.

617
00:49:22,871 --> 00:49:26,082
Shaw: You go on to Russia,
I'll handle him.

618
00:49:27,834 --> 00:49:29,902
Charles: I can't stop thinking
about the others out there.

619
00:49:29,902 --> 00:49:32,421
All those minds that I've touched.

620
00:49:32,881 --> 00:49:38,386
I could feel them, their isolation, their hopes,
their ambitions.

621
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:41,764
I tell you, we've started something
incredible, Erik.

622
00:49:42,307 --> 00:49:44,934
- We can help them.
- Can we?

623
00:49:46,102 --> 00:49:49,105
Identification, that's how it starts.

624
00:49:50,565 --> 00:49:54,402
Then ends with being rounded up.
Experimented on, eliminated.

625
00:49:54,402 --> 00:49:56,029
Not this time.

626
00:49:56,154 --> 00:49:59,991
We have common enemies, Shaw
and the Russians they need us.

627
00:49:59,991 --> 00:50:01,451
For now.

628
00:50:07,123 --> 00:50:08,791
Raven: We should think of code names.

629
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:11,085
We're government agents now,
we should have secret code names.

630
00:50:11,211 --> 00:50:15,256
- I want to be called, Mystique.
- Damn, I wanted to be called, Mystique.

631
00:50:15,381 --> 00:50:17,342
- Well tough, I called it.

632
00:50:18,843 --> 00:50:22,138
(Seans voice) Damn right,
I'm more mysterious than you.

633
00:50:24,516 --> 00:50:27,977
- Darwin, what about you?
- Well, uh, Darwin's already a nickname.

634
00:50:28,061 --> 00:50:32,106
And you know, sort of fits.
Adapt to survive and all.

635
00:50:32,524 --> 00:50:33,983
Check this out.

636
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:44,160
(Whooping and laughing)

637
00:50:46,371 --> 00:50:47,413
(Clapping)

638
00:50:47,664 --> 00:50:49,582
- Thank you, thank you.
- Bravo, bravo.

639
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:53,044
- What about you?
- I'm going to be...

640
00:50:54,254 --> 00:50:55,129
...Banshee.

641
00:50:55,255 --> 00:50:56,923
Why do you want to be named
after a wailing spirit?

642
00:50:57,006 --> 00:50:58,716
Sean: You might want to cover your ears.

643
00:51:02,262 --> 00:51:03,930
(Inhales)

644
00:51:07,392 --> 00:51:08,434
(High pitched whistle)

645
00:51:11,938 --> 00:51:12,981
(All laughing)

646
00:51:14,649 --> 00:51:15,441
Your turn.

647
00:51:15,608 --> 00:51:20,280
My uh, stage name is Angel.
Kind of fits.

648
00:51:20,405 --> 00:51:23,867
- You can fly?
-  Ah, hah. And uh...

649
00:51:28,037 --> 00:51:29,080
((Sizzles))

650
00:51:33,001 --> 00:51:36,462
- What's your name?
- How about Big Foot?

651
00:51:36,588 --> 00:51:39,048
Well you know what they say
about guys with big feet?

652
00:51:39,424 --> 00:51:41,593
And uh, yours are kind of small.

653
00:51:41,593 --> 00:51:43,303
Okay, now.

654
00:51:44,095 --> 00:51:46,222
Alex, what is your gift?
What can you do?

655
00:51:46,347 --> 00:51:50,185
Uh, it's not um, I just can't do it.

656
00:51:50,185 --> 00:51:52,854
- I can't do it in here.
- Can you do it out there?

657
00:51:52,854 --> 00:51:54,230
- Raven: Why don't you just do it out there.
- Angel: Come on.

658
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:56,608
- Raven: Come on, Alex.
- Alex! Alex!

659
00:51:56,608 --> 00:51:59,736
All chanting: Alex, Alex, Alex.

660
00:52:02,322 --> 00:52:03,781
That's the spirit.

661
00:52:03,907 --> 00:52:05,450
Get down when I tell you.

662
00:52:13,249 --> 00:52:14,542
Get back.

663
00:52:19,339 --> 00:52:20,798
Get back!

664
00:52:22,133 --> 00:52:23,426
Whatever...

665
00:52:33,436 --> 00:52:35,438
(Cheering, clapping)

666
00:52:37,232 --> 00:52:41,486
We've got Intel that Shaw is meeting with
the Russian defense chief in Moscow.

667
00:52:41,486 --> 00:52:43,363
So go ahead, say it.

668
00:52:43,655 --> 00:52:46,615
I'm not here to say "I told you so",
you know why I'm here.

669
00:52:46,616 --> 00:52:48,785
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Clearance to bring
along your mutants.

670
00:52:48,785 --> 00:52:50,662
Fight fire with fire.

671
00:52:51,371 --> 00:52:52,372
Makes sense.

672
00:52:52,497 --> 00:52:54,541
Wait, you're okay with this?

673
00:52:54,541 --> 00:52:57,460
Sending in a bunch of untrained
unauthorized freaks?

674
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:01,464
These "Freaks" are dedicated hard working people.

675
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,551
Plane leaves for Russia in an hour.

676
00:53:04,551 --> 00:53:06,511
I'm telling you these kids
are not ready for, Shaw.

677
00:53:06,594 --> 00:53:09,472
I think they're going to surprise you. They
are an exceptional bunch of young people.

678
00:53:09,556 --> 00:53:10,682
What the hell?

679
00:53:14,394 --> 00:53:16,729
# Chan Romero, The hippy hippy shake #

680
00:53:22,777 --> 00:53:24,654
Harder!

681
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,322
Darwin: Harder!

682
00:53:28,575 --> 00:53:30,827
What are you doing?

683
00:53:36,457 --> 00:53:39,643
- Who destroyed the statue?
- Hank: It was, Alex.

684
00:53:39,752 --> 00:53:43,214
No Havok! We have to call him, Havok.
That's his name now.

685
00:53:43,298 --> 00:53:46,467
And we were thinking, you should be, Professor X

686
00:53:46,634 --> 00:53:49,304
And you should be, Magneto.

687
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,098
Exceptional.

688
00:53:56,477 --> 00:53:58,313
I expect more from you.

689
00:54:01,482 --> 00:54:04,694
Russian Military Retreat

690
00:54:15,246 --> 00:54:16,956
(Knocking)

691
00:54:19,209 --> 00:54:20,210
Driver: We've got a problem.

692
00:54:20,335 --> 00:54:22,837
- What?
- I'm so sorry, this wasn't on the map.

693
00:54:29,427 --> 00:54:32,430
No matter what happens, act normally.
I'll take care of this, all right.

694
00:54:34,015 --> 00:54:35,225
All right, listen to me..

695
00:54:38,019 --> 00:54:39,062
Where are you going?

696
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:40,772
To our farm.

697
00:54:41,439 --> 00:54:42,482
(Dog growls and barks)

698
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:43,733
Open the back.

699
00:54:44,108 --> 00:54:45,652
As you wish, as you wish.

700
00:54:46,778 --> 00:54:49,113
(Dog barking in background)

701
00:54:50,573 --> 00:54:52,742
Oh, easy, easy.
Take it easy, chaps.

702
00:55:08,091 --> 00:55:10,802
- Guard: Anything back there?
- Nothing, it's empty.

703
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:15,807
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

704
00:55:18,726 --> 00:55:19,769
(Doors slam shut)

705
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,707
- Where's Shaw?
- I know her.

706
00:55:41,457 --> 00:55:44,586
She's the telepath, and I read her, she'll know we're here.

707
00:55:45,837 --> 00:55:47,839
Let me try something else.

708
00:56:05,523 --> 00:56:08,193
Shaw sends his apologies, but
he's indisposed.

709
00:56:08,193 --> 00:56:09,736
He asked me to come in his place.

710
00:56:10,695 --> 00:56:14,991
But between you and I honey,
I'm a lot better company.

711
00:56:15,783 --> 00:56:17,202
Please come in.

712
00:56:21,748 --> 00:56:23,041
He's not coming.

713
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:29,374
- So, what now, boss?
- Now, nothing. We're here for Shaw.

714
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:30,882
- Mission aborted
- The hell it is.

715
00:56:31,049 --> 00:56:33,384
- Erik.
- She's his right hand woman.

716
00:56:33,384 --> 00:56:34,886
That's good enough for me.

717
00:56:34,886 --> 00:56:37,597
The CIA invading the home of a senior
Soviet official.

718
00:56:37,722 --> 00:56:40,266
- Are you crazy?
- I'm not CIA.

719
00:56:41,226 --> 00:56:42,310
Erik!

720
00:56:44,312 --> 00:56:46,564
(Glasses clink)
To your health.

721
00:56:50,652 --> 00:56:52,612
Frost: So you must be busy
planning your next move.

722
00:56:52,737 --> 00:56:56,199
What with the American's refusing to remove
their missiles from Turkey.

723
00:56:57,450 --> 00:57:00,828
You know I can't talk about those things, Miss Frost.

724
00:57:01,246 --> 00:57:02,664
Emma.

725
00:57:05,667 --> 00:57:09,671
And don't worry, you don't have to say a word.

726
00:57:17,512 --> 00:57:20,473
(Soldiers shouting)

727
00:57:26,354 --> 00:57:27,981
Driver: He's going to start
world war III single handed.

728
00:57:28,064 --> 00:57:29,983
- We have to do something.
- Like what?

729
00:57:30,441 --> 00:57:32,151
- We're moving out.
- You can't.

730
00:57:47,667 --> 00:57:50,044
I'm sorry, I can't leave him.

731
00:57:50,545 --> 00:57:52,046
(Guards shouts warning)

732
00:58:02,098 --> 00:58:03,349
For goodness sake, Erik...

733
00:58:04,142 --> 00:58:04,726
Be calm.

734
00:58:05,185 --> 00:58:08,771
Be calm.
Forget my face. Yes.

735
00:58:13,693 --> 00:58:14,736
(Speaking Russian)

736
00:58:17,864 --> 00:58:22,035
You're beautiful, so beautiful...yes.

737
00:58:22,619 --> 00:58:24,078
Pathetic.

738
00:58:31,294 --> 00:58:32,337
You are.

739
00:58:36,049 --> 00:58:37,467
Nice trick.

740
00:58:39,677 --> 00:58:41,054
Who are  you?

741
00:58:45,016 --> 00:58:46,017
Go to sleep.

742
00:58:54,317 --> 00:58:56,778
You can stop trying to read my mind, sugar.

743
00:58:58,696 --> 00:59:01,616
You're never going to get anything
from me while I'm like this.

744
00:59:14,295 --> 00:59:16,047
So then you can just tell us.

745
00:59:18,466 --> 00:59:20,093
Where is Shaw?

746
00:59:26,558 --> 00:59:27,684
Erik.

747
00:59:34,274 --> 00:59:35,483
Erik, that's enough.

748
00:59:44,242 --> 00:59:45,910
Erik, that's enough!

749
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:48,496
(Diamond cracking)

750
00:59:55,545 --> 00:59:56,796
All yours.

751
00:59:58,089 --> 01:00:00,216
She won't be shifting into diamond form again.

752
01:00:01,176 --> 01:00:03,911
But if she does, just give her a gentle tap.

753
01:00:22,405 --> 01:00:25,867
(Explosions)

754
01:00:29,621 --> 01:00:32,248
Shaw: We are the children of the atom.

755
01:00:32,707 --> 01:00:35,293
Radiation gave birth to mutants.

756
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:39,631
What will kill the humans,
will only make us stronger.

757
01:00:44,385 --> 01:00:45,845
Beautiful, isn't it?

758
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:51,184
This is worse that we previously imagined.

759
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,188
We're taking you with us.

760
01:00:55,396 --> 01:00:59,025
- CIA will want to question you themselves.
- I doubt it.

761
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,736
Might be other things to worry about right now.

762
01:01:07,992 --> 01:01:09,827
Alex: Whoa, all right.

763
01:01:10,286 --> 01:01:12,724
Darwin: Jesus, man you are killing me.

764
01:01:12,726 --> 01:01:15,124
Don't beat yourself up, we got a lot of spare time.

765
01:01:20,213 --> 01:01:22,549
Oh, I didn't know the circus was in town.

766
01:01:22,632 --> 01:01:25,218
CIA Agent: Hey come on honey, give us a little, uh...

767
01:01:25,385 --> 01:01:29,981
No? Come on, let's see the foot.
There it is, come on Bigfoot let's go.

768
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:31,724
Hey, hey come on, hey.

769
01:01:36,396 --> 01:01:38,231
They're just guys being stupid.

770
01:01:38,523 --> 01:01:42,301
Guy's being stupid I can handle.
Okay, I've handled that my whole life.

771
01:01:42,306 --> 01:01:44,529
But I'd rather have a bunch of guys
stare at me with my clothes off,

772
01:01:44,529 --> 01:01:46,906
then the way these one's stare at me.

773
01:01:47,866 --> 01:01:49,200
At us.

774
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:53,621
(Distant explosion, whooshing sound)

775
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:57,166
(Explosion)

776
01:01:57,208 --> 01:01:58,418
What was that?

777
01:02:00,628 --> 01:02:02,922
Darwin: I don't know, but
something doesn't feel right.

778
01:02:06,217 --> 01:02:07,260
(Whooshing)

779
01:02:11,472 --> 01:02:13,610
Man in Black: No news of Shaw?

780
01:02:13,612 --> 01:02:15,810
Agent: Not a peep, nothing through that back channel.

781
01:02:16,686 --> 01:02:19,147
(Explosion, whooshing)

782
01:02:29,115 --> 01:02:30,325
What is that?

783
01:02:31,409 --> 01:02:32,452
(Screams in fear)

784
01:02:33,161 --> 01:02:34,204
(Screams)

785
01:02:38,666 --> 01:02:39,709
(Bodies thudding on ground)

786
01:02:39,834 --> 01:02:40,877
Agent: Ahhhh.
(Glass shatters)

787
01:02:48,051 --> 01:02:49,636
We have an intruder on the main atrium.

788
01:02:49,886 --> 01:02:50,514
Shaw: Where are the mutants?

789
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:52,514
You take another step, I'm going to put you down.

790
01:02:52,722 --> 01:02:55,266
Of course you will, but where do I find
the more evolved people?

791
01:02:57,018 --> 01:02:58,102
Send back-up now!

792
01:03:01,356 --> 01:03:03,900
Get back, get back, do not leave that room.
We're under attack.

793
01:03:04,234 --> 01:03:06,277
- Look out!
- Shoot it, shoot it!

794
01:03:06,444 --> 01:03:07,487
(Machine gun fire)

795
01:03:10,949 --> 01:03:11,991
(Glass shatters, bullets ricochet)

796
01:03:14,244 --> 01:03:16,496
(Tornado whistling)

797
01:03:20,166 --> 01:03:21,209
Shaw: Where are the mutants?

798
01:03:21,417 --> 01:03:23,461
Agent: Put that man down or we will open fire.

799
01:03:48,987 --> 01:03:51,531
Stay here my ass.
Let's go!

800
01:03:56,744 --> 01:03:58,580
- Get back!
- We can help, we can help!

801
01:04:38,119 --> 01:04:39,162
(Raven sobbing)

802
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,307
(Gun fires in hallway,
Raven screams)

803
01:04:59,724 --> 01:05:02,560
Agent: Wait, wait, you want the mutants?
They're right through that door.

804
01:05:02,602 --> 01:05:04,020
Just let us normal people go.

805
01:05:04,312 --> 01:05:05,605
We're no threa...
(Sound of body falling)

806
01:05:14,906 --> 01:05:15,823
Shaw: Where's the telepath?

807
01:05:16,658 --> 01:05:18,368
- Not here.
- To bad.

808
01:05:19,202 --> 01:05:20,912
Now I can take this silly thing off.

809
01:05:23,456 --> 01:05:26,251
Good evening
My name's, Sebastian Shaw.

810
01:05:28,503 --> 01:05:30,797
And I am not here to hurt you.

811
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:31,923
Agent: Freeze!

812
01:05:32,757 --> 01:05:33,633
Azazel...

813
01:05:37,554 --> 01:05:40,265
My friends, there's a revolution coming.

814
01:05:40,723 --> 01:05:44,018
When mankind discovers who we are,
what we can do.

815
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:45,895
Each of us will face a choice.

816
01:05:46,813 --> 01:05:51,276
Be enslaved, or rise up to rule.

817
01:05:52,277 --> 01:05:54,821
Choose freely, but know that if you are not with us,

818
01:05:54,821 --> 01:05:58,283
then by definition you are against us.

819
01:05:59,158 --> 01:06:05,164
So, you can stay, and fight for the
people who hate, and fear you.

820
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:10,211
Or you can join me.
And live like kings.

821
01:06:16,426 --> 01:06:17,760
And Queens.

822
01:06:29,564 --> 01:06:31,232
- Angel?
- Are you kidding me?

823
01:06:32,066 --> 01:06:35,236
Come on, we don't belong here.

824
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:38,072
And that's nothing to be ashamed of.

825
01:06:43,328 --> 01:06:44,662
We have to do something.

826
01:06:46,748 --> 01:06:47,790
(Broken glass jingles)

827
01:07:00,512 --> 01:07:03,515
Stop, I'm coming with you.

828
01:07:07,352 --> 01:07:08,436
Good choice.

829
01:07:10,104 --> 01:07:12,190
So tell me about your mutation.

830
01:07:12,941 --> 01:07:14,526
Well, I adapt to survive.

831
01:07:18,071 --> 01:07:21,157
- So I guess I'm coming with you.
- I like that.

832
01:07:28,081 --> 01:07:30,250
- Alex,...............do it!
- Get down!

833
01:07:36,047 --> 01:07:37,465
Protecting your fellow mutants?

834
01:07:38,925 --> 01:07:41,928
Shaw: It's a noble gesture.
Feels good.

835
01:07:48,268 --> 01:07:49,769
Adapt to this.

836
01:08:20,133 --> 01:08:24,137
Moscow, Russia

837
01:08:33,897 --> 01:08:34,939
Hello.

838
01:08:36,608 --> 01:08:44,866
Once again, my sympathies for your
treatment at the hands of the CIA.

839
01:08:45,491 --> 01:08:47,285
These Americans are ruthless.

840
01:08:48,244 --> 01:08:52,415
Now they have their missiles placed in Turkey.

841
01:08:53,583 --> 01:08:58,338
I expect you'll be planning
missile sites of your own.

842
01:08:58,463 --> 01:09:04,761
Somewhere you know the American
early-warning system won't help.

843
01:09:05,386 --> 01:09:09,641
I hear Cuba is lovely this time of year.

844
01:09:10,058 --> 01:09:12,852
And so close to Florida.

845
01:09:13,937 --> 01:09:15,605
Missiles in Cuba?

846
01:09:18,149 --> 01:09:19,526
You're serious?

847
01:09:20,527 --> 01:09:23,154
We may as well declare war.

848
01:09:24,364 --> 01:09:26,324
Maybe I wasn't clear enough.

849
01:09:28,826 --> 01:09:31,345
You will make this happen.

850
01:09:33,248 --> 01:09:34,290
Okay.

851
01:09:34,999 --> 01:09:38,260
Let's see what KGB think about this.

852
01:09:41,923 --> 01:09:45,051
Hello, General Armivolkoff.

853
01:09:48,304 --> 01:09:50,098
It's nothing.

854
01:09:59,899 --> 01:10:03,945
(Tires screech, doors slam)

855
01:10:06,656 --> 01:10:07,407
Raven.

856
01:10:13,746 --> 01:10:16,000
Charles: We've made arrangements for you to
be taken home immediately.

857
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,833
- Sean: We're not going home.
- What?

858
01:10:17,917 --> 01:10:21,296
- He's not going back to prison.
- They killed, Darwin.

859
01:10:21,296 --> 01:10:22,839
Charles: All the more reason for you to leave.

860
01:10:23,047 --> 01:10:23,965
This is over.

861
01:10:24,424 --> 01:10:28,511
Darwin's dead, Charles.
And we can't even bury him.

862
01:10:31,139 --> 01:10:32,640
We can avenge him.

863
01:10:36,144 --> 01:10:37,478
Erik, word please.

864
01:10:41,524 --> 01:10:44,152
- They're just kids.
- No, they were kids.

865
01:10:44,694 --> 01:10:46,863
Shaw has his army, we need ours.

866
01:10:52,952 --> 01:10:56,122
Charles: We'll have to train.
All of us.

867
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,791
- Yes?
- Yeah.

868
01:10:59,709 --> 01:11:01,002
Well we can't stay here.

869
01:11:01,461 --> 01:11:03,922
Even if they reopen the department,
it's not safe.

870
01:11:04,881 --> 01:11:06,883
We've got no where to go.

871
01:11:09,636 --> 01:11:10,845
Yes, we do.

872
01:11:11,471 --> 01:11:13,554
McCone: The law says we've got to turn her over.

873
01:11:13,556 --> 01:11:15,850
Stryker: The law applies to human beings.

874
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:19,229
The same laws don't apply to mutants.
They're to dangerous.

875
01:11:19,229 --> 01:11:22,899
Times like this, security is more
important than liberty.

876
01:11:23,441 --> 01:11:28,612
- There's a war coming, John.
- McCone: Yes, but a war with who?

877
01:11:35,787 --> 01:11:38,206
(Screech of glass cutting)

878
01:11:39,749 --> 01:11:40,792
(Tap)

879
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,545
Excellent question.

880
01:11:44,587 --> 01:11:46,981
Though I won't call it a war exactly.

881
01:11:47,423 --> 01:11:50,943
That suggests both sides stand an
equal chance of winning.

882
01:12:00,603 --> 01:12:02,564
Captain, no sign of any American Ships.

883
01:12:03,273 --> 01:12:05,733
Maintain course, full ahead.

884
01:12:06,317 --> 01:12:09,220
Man: The Russians have
sent their warheads to Cuba.

885
01:12:09,279 --> 01:12:11,614
We have a week before their ship hits the coast.

886
01:12:11,614 --> 01:12:16,243
Our fleet can be on this line,
when the Russian missile ship arrives.

887
01:12:16,452 --> 01:12:21,916
If that ship crosses the line, they will have
declared war against the United States.

888
01:12:22,458 --> 01:12:25,978
We will have no choice but to retaliate
with a full nuclear response.

889
01:12:26,379 --> 01:12:27,630
Do we agree?

890
01:12:32,802 --> 01:12:34,553
Man: Dispatch the Seventh fleet.

891
01:12:37,473 --> 01:12:40,977
- This is yours?
- No, it's ours.

892
01:12:47,483 --> 01:12:50,278
Honestly Charles, I don't know how you survived.

893
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:52,363
Living in such hardship.

894
01:12:52,655 --> 01:12:55,241
Well it was a hardship softened by me.

895
01:12:58,536 --> 01:13:01,080
Come on, time for the tour.

896
01:13:08,254 --> 01:13:12,133
Moscow, Russia

897
01:13:14,135 --> 01:13:15,845
Dear comrades.

898
01:13:15,845 --> 01:13:23,394
The United States have dispatched
war ships for Cuba.

899
01:13:23,978 --> 01:13:27,899
This leaves us with no choice.

900
01:13:29,234 --> 01:13:36,491
Comrade First Secretary.
We must send in our fleet.

901
01:13:39,244 --> 01:13:41,204
Dispatch the fleet!

902
01:13:42,872 --> 01:13:43,915
(Camera flash)

903
01:13:46,125 --> 01:13:48,962
TV announcer: President Kennedy has
signed a formal proclamation.

904
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:52,841
Setting up a blockade of all missiles,
armed for Cuba.

905
01:13:53,925 --> 01:13:56,939
The Soviet Union reacted by terming it
as step...

906
01:13:56,939 --> 01:14:00,139
along the road to unleashing a thermal nuclear war.

907
01:14:10,817 --> 01:14:13,236
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.

908
01:14:14,279 --> 01:14:14,988
All right.

909
01:14:22,328 --> 01:14:26,791
No, no I can't I'm sorry. I can't shoot
anybody point  blank, let alone my friend.

910
01:14:27,083 --> 01:14:28,960
Oh come on, you know I can deflect it.

911
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,503
You're always telling me I should push myself.

912
01:14:30,503 --> 01:14:33,673
If you know you can deflect it, then
you're not challenging yourself.

913
01:14:35,383 --> 01:14:38,011
What ever happened to the man
who was trying to raise a submarine?

914
01:14:39,095 --> 01:14:39,846
What, I can't.

915
01:14:41,055 --> 01:14:43,825
Something that big, I need the situation, the anger.

916
01:14:43,825 --> 01:14:45,101
No, the anger's not enough.

917
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:49,480
- Well it's gotten the job done all this time.
- It's nearly gotten you killed all this time.

918
01:14:50,982 --> 01:14:51,816
Hey, come here.

919
01:14:52,984 --> 01:14:55,028
Let's try something a little more challenging.

920
01:14:56,321 --> 01:15:00,575
My step-father took the possibility
of nuclear war quite seriously. This way.

921
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:03,177
That's why he had this bunker built down here.

922
01:15:03,177 --> 01:15:05,413
I thought we could use it as a practice range of sort.

923
01:15:05,622 --> 01:15:07,373
You don't think I'm going to blow though the walls?

924
01:15:07,373 --> 01:15:10,076
No, he had this place built to
with stand a nuclear bomb.

925
01:15:10,084 --> 01:15:11,834
I think it can handle you, Alex.

926
01:15:11,836 --> 01:15:14,522
You know when I do this,
bad things tend to happen.

927
01:15:14,964 --> 01:15:18,426
That's because you can't control it.
It controls you.

928
01:15:18,968 --> 01:15:21,679
That's why we're here, Alex.
It's part of your training.

929
01:15:22,388 --> 01:15:23,431
(Sonic whistle)
(Glass shatters)

930
01:15:24,807 --> 01:15:25,850
(Charles joyfully laughs)

931
01:15:26,768 --> 01:15:27,977
What you're doing is incredible.

932
01:15:28,228 --> 01:15:30,939
You're hitting a pitch with sound waves at
the same resonate frequency of the glass.

933
01:15:30,939 --> 01:15:32,023
That's why it shatters.

934
01:15:32,023 --> 01:15:34,651
But this, it's like any
other muscle in the body.

935
01:15:34,651 --> 01:15:35,693
You can control it.

936
01:15:37,612 --> 01:15:40,573
"In each of us, two natures are at war."

937
01:15:40,573 --> 01:15:43,476
- Robert Louis Stevenson, "Jekyll and Hyde".
- Top marks.

938
01:15:43,576 --> 01:15:45,620
Still it really wasn't really about good
and evil. Was it, Hank.

939
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:48,973
It was about man's animal nature,
and his struggle to control it.

940
01:15:48,973 --> 01:15:50,183
To conform.

941
01:15:50,183 --> 01:15:52,626
It is that struggle which is holding you back.

942
01:15:52,794 --> 01:15:55,505
Jekyll is afraid of what he could be capable of.

943
01:15:55,505 --> 01:15:56,864
You are too.

944
01:15:57,090 --> 01:15:59,784
If you're serious about me doing this,
you might want to get back.

945
01:15:59,843 --> 01:16:04,347
- Of course, should I shut the door?
- Yeah.

946
01:16:06,516 --> 01:16:07,892
Charles: Whenever you're ready.

947
01:16:10,228 --> 01:16:12,605
(Explosion, light beeping)

948
01:16:14,148 --> 01:16:16,234
(Fires roaring)
Oh my god.

949
01:16:20,029 --> 01:16:22,490
Charles: I will teach you to control this, Alex.

950
01:16:25,368 --> 01:16:27,328
Sean: You're sure that this will work.

951
01:16:27,537 --> 01:16:29,622
Anything is possible. I based the design...

952
01:16:29,622 --> 01:16:31,958
Hank, stop talking.
Come on.

953
01:16:32,125 --> 01:16:34,127
Now remember, scream as hard as you can.

954
01:16:34,127 --> 01:16:36,004
You need the sound waves to be supersonic.

955
01:16:36,004 --> 01:16:38,255
Catch them at the right angle,
and they should carry you.

956
01:16:38,506 --> 01:16:41,634
"They should carry me."
That's reassuring.

957
01:16:42,552 --> 01:16:43,386
Good luck.

958
01:16:44,137 --> 01:16:45,930
Charles: And don't forget to scream.

959
01:16:52,395 --> 01:16:53,438
Ahh.

960
01:16:55,398 --> 01:16:59,110
If you want to beat me this time,
you have to set the beast free.

961
01:17:00,278 --> 01:17:04,390
Charles: On your marks, get set...GO!

962
01:17:19,506 --> 01:17:21,215
Oh, congratulations my friend.

963
01:17:21,382 --> 01:17:23,726
Robert Louis Stevenson
would have been proud.

964
01:17:25,178 --> 01:17:26,863
Impressive, Hank.

965
01:17:26,863 --> 01:17:28,956
Feet like those, all you need is a red nose.

966
01:17:28,956 --> 01:17:29,849
Right, Bozo?

967
01:17:30,725 --> 01:17:33,185
- I'm done here.
- Thank you, Alex

968
01:17:33,895 --> 01:17:34,812
Charles: Come on, Hank.

969
01:17:46,032 --> 01:17:48,868
Erik: If you're using half the
concentration to look normal.

970
01:17:49,244 --> 01:17:52,151
Then you're only half paying attention to
whatever else you do.

971
01:17:52,163 --> 01:17:54,999
Just pointing out something that could save your life.

972
01:17:59,629 --> 01:18:01,922
You want society to accept you.

973
01:18:02,382 --> 01:18:04,175
But you can't even accept yourself.

974
01:18:10,932 --> 01:18:11,850
Alex: Sexy.

975
01:18:13,101 --> 01:18:14,435
This is just the prototype.

976
01:18:14,443 --> 01:18:16,746
The real one will look considerably better,
it'll be a whole suit.

977
01:18:16,746 --> 01:18:19,409
See these sensors measure
your energy output, this panel

978
01:18:19,409 --> 01:18:21,934
focuses it and the excess is absorbed.

979
01:18:21,934 --> 01:18:24,928
All right try hitting the one in the middle,
just the one in the middle, mind.

980
01:18:24,988 --> 01:18:25,697
Charles: Good luck.

981
01:18:27,866 --> 01:18:28,908
(Plasma beam blasts)

982
01:18:32,537 --> 01:18:33,580
Oomph!

983
01:18:36,165 --> 01:18:39,018
You ought to see this. Your genes are
extraordinary, you know that.

984
01:18:39,043 --> 01:18:41,187
Your cells age at half the rate of a normal human.

985
01:18:41,187 --> 01:18:43,847
When you're forty you will still
have the looks of a teenager.

986
01:18:43,847 --> 01:18:47,851
You have the most incredible cellular
structure I've ever seen.

987
01:18:52,557 --> 01:18:56,210
- Sean: You truly believe I'll fly this time?
- Charles: Unreservedly.

988
01:18:56,227 --> 01:18:57,978
- I trust you.
- I'm touched.

989
01:18:57,987 --> 01:18:59,563
- I don't trust him.
- Say nothing.

990
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:01,982
I'm going to die!

991
01:19:01,982 --> 01:19:04,277
All right, look we're not going to make
you do anything that your not so...

992
01:19:04,277 --> 01:19:05,528
Here, let me help him.

993
01:19:07,447 --> 01:19:08,489
Erik!

994
01:19:11,826 --> 01:19:12,869
(Screams)

995
01:19:20,043 --> 01:19:22,754
Whaoooo!
(Laughs)

996
01:19:27,592 --> 01:19:29,135
Wahhh hooo!

997
01:19:29,761 --> 01:19:30,803
What?

998
01:19:30,970 --> 01:19:33,364
You know you were thinking the same.

999
01:19:33,932 --> 01:19:37,810
Wonderful work Hank, thank you very much.
All right Alex, I want you to hit the X.

1000
01:19:38,061 --> 01:19:40,312
And try not to hit me, there's a good chap.

1001
01:19:40,647 --> 01:19:43,674
- You're serious?
- I'm very serious.

1002
01:19:43,691 --> 01:19:46,152
Charles: I have complete and utter faith in you.

1003
01:19:49,572 --> 01:19:50,615
(Plasma beam explodes)

1004
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:02,503
- Am I still a Bozo?
- Yes, Hank. You're still a Bozo.

1005
01:20:03,603 --> 01:20:04,754
But nice job.

1006
01:20:07,799 --> 01:20:08,758
See that?

1007
01:20:09,592 --> 01:20:11,510
Try turning it to face us.

1008
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:17,892
(Exhales)

1009
01:20:30,697 --> 01:20:36,577
You know, I believe the true focus lies
somewhere between rage and serenity.

1010
01:20:37,787 --> 01:20:40,456
Would you mind, if I...?

1011
01:21:14,032 --> 01:21:15,566
What did you just do to me?

1012
01:21:16,701 --> 01:21:20,788
I accessed the brightest corner
of your memory system.

1013
01:21:22,248 --> 01:21:24,626
It's a very beautiful memory Erik, thank you.

1014
01:21:25,752 --> 01:21:27,629
I didn't know I still had that.

1015
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,924
There's so much more to you than you know.

1016
01:21:31,633 --> 01:21:36,679
Not just pain, and anger.
There's good too, I felt it.

1017
01:21:37,722 --> 01:21:39,766
And when you can access all that.

1018
01:21:40,141 --> 01:21:42,769
You will possess a power no one can match.

1019
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:45,355
Not even me.

1020
01:21:47,232 --> 01:21:49,400
So, come on. Try again.

1021
01:22:05,792 --> 01:22:08,920
(Metal in Satellite dish creaking)

1022
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:31,809
- Moira: Hey!
- Well done.

1023
01:22:31,809 --> 01:22:34,486
The President is about to make his address.

1024
01:22:35,655 --> 01:22:40,242
TV announcer: It shall be the policy of
this nation to regard any nuclear missile,

1025
01:22:40,242 --> 01:22:43,704
...crossing the embargo line, that surrounds Cuba.

1026
01:22:43,704 --> 01:22:47,750
As an attack by the Soviet Union
on the United States.

1027
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:52,196
Requiring a full retaliatory response.
Upon the Soviet Union.

1028
01:22:52,196 --> 01:22:54,382
- Thatâ€™s' where we're going to find, Shaw'
- How do you know?

1029
01:22:54,382 --> 01:22:57,677
Charles: Two super powers facing off, and
he want's to start world war III.

1030
01:22:58,095 --> 01:23:00,013
He won't leave anything to chance.

1031
01:23:00,021 --> 01:23:04,184
So much for diplomacy.
I suggest you all get a good nights sleep.

1032
01:23:04,184 --> 01:23:06,978
Kennedy: ...ultimately leads to war.

1033
01:23:07,478 --> 01:23:11,357
TV announcer: Tensions mount as
the Soviet Missile ship nears Cuba.

1034
01:23:11,941 --> 01:23:16,279
All diplomatic efforts to avert
Nuclear war have thus far failed.

1035
01:23:16,821 --> 01:23:21,034
As the American people ready themselves,
for the likelihood of an atomic attack.

1036
01:23:21,034 --> 01:23:23,786
There are widespread reports of panic buying.

1037
01:23:24,579 --> 01:23:26,164
Supermarkets cleared.

1038
01:23:26,414 --> 01:23:31,461
As shelters unused since the second world
war, are stocked for what may lie ahead.

1039
01:23:31,878 --> 01:23:36,507
In all its history, America has never
faced a greater threat.

1040
01:23:36,549 --> 01:23:40,761
The world is primed for war.
And there's no one to stop me.

1041
01:23:45,016 --> 01:23:46,893
(Knock on door)
Come in.

1042
01:23:47,769 --> 01:23:48,770
Hank: Hey.

1043
01:23:50,104 --> 01:23:51,705
Got a surprise for you.

1044
01:24:00,532 --> 01:24:03,993
I isolated the right marker in your DNA sample.

1045
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:06,370
The serum works like an anti-biotic.

1046
01:24:06,370 --> 01:24:09,248
Attacking the cells that cause our physical mutation.

1047
01:24:09,374 --> 01:24:11,876
It won't affect our abilities,
just our appearance.

1048
01:24:14,879 --> 01:24:16,381
Do you still want to do this?

1049
01:24:17,799 --> 01:24:19,934
Should we have to hide?

1050
01:24:21,177 --> 01:24:22,720
You already do.

1051
01:24:23,179 --> 01:24:26,282
You're hiding right now.
Like I have my whole life.

1052
01:24:26,850 --> 01:24:29,752
I don't want to feel like a freak, all the time.

1053
01:24:29,752 --> 01:24:31,504
- I just want to look...
- ...normal.

1054
01:24:31,521 --> 01:24:32,397
Yeah.

1055
01:24:39,779 --> 01:24:41,197
Hank, don't.

1056
01:24:43,116 --> 01:24:47,703
You're beautiful, Hank.
Everything you are, you're perfect.

1057
01:24:50,039 --> 01:24:53,584
Raven: Look at all of us. Look at
all we've achieved this week.

1058
01:24:53,584 --> 01:24:55,086
All we will achieve.

1059
01:24:56,629 --> 01:25:02,093
We are different. But we shouldn't
be trying to fit into society.

1060
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:05,596
Raven: Society should aspire and be more like us.

1061
01:25:06,806 --> 01:25:09,809
Mutant, and proud.

1062
01:25:15,023 --> 01:25:18,776
It behooves me to tell you,
but even if we save the world tomorrow.

1063
01:25:18,943 --> 01:25:21,112
And mutants are accepted into society.

1064
01:25:22,071 --> 01:25:24,782
My feet and your natural blue form.

1065
01:25:25,867 --> 01:25:27,619
Will never be deemed beautiful.

1066
01:25:33,249 --> 01:25:34,667
You look beautiful now.

1067
01:25:36,628 --> 01:25:39,631
We need this cure.

1068
01:26:06,699 --> 01:26:11,663
Cuba, Russia, America makes no difference.

1069
01:26:12,622 --> 01:26:15,250
Shaw's declared war on mankind,
on all of us.

1070
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:17,214
He has to be stopped.

1071
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:21,714
I'm not going to stop Shaw, I'm going to kill him.

1072
01:26:24,968 --> 01:26:26,761
Do you have it in you to allow that?

1073
01:26:33,309 --> 01:26:35,603
You've known all along
why I was here, Charles.

1074
01:26:36,062 --> 01:26:37,313
But things have changed.

1075
01:26:38,398 --> 01:26:40,441
What started as a covert mission,

1076
01:26:40,692 --> 01:26:43,695
...tomorrow mankind will know that mutants exist.

1077
01:26:43,695 --> 01:26:45,905
Shaw, us... they won't differentiate.

1078
01:26:46,531 --> 01:26:49,993
They'll fear us, and that
fear will turn to hatred.

1079
01:26:50,451 --> 01:26:53,621
Not if we stop a war.
Not if we can prevent, Shaw.

1080
01:26:53,830 --> 01:26:55,665
Not if we risk our lives doing so.

1081
01:26:55,915 --> 01:26:57,000
Would they do the same for us?

1082
01:26:57,250 --> 01:26:58,751
We have it in us to be the better men.

1083
01:26:59,002 --> 01:27:00,545
We already are.

1084
01:27:00,962 --> 01:27:02,547
We're the next stage of human evolution.

1085
01:27:02,755 --> 01:27:04,257
- You said it yourself.
- Enough.

1086
01:27:04,883 --> 01:27:06,759
Are you really so naive?

1087
01:27:06,759 --> 01:27:09,429
As to think they won't battle their own extinction?

1088
01:27:10,972 --> 01:27:13,266
- Or is it arrogance?
- I'm sorry.

1089
01:27:14,517 --> 01:27:16,394
After tomorrow they're going to turn on us.

1090
01:27:16,519 --> 01:27:19,772
And you're blind to it, because you
believe they're all like Moira.

1091
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:21,900
And you believe they're all like, Shaw.

1092
01:27:24,402 --> 01:27:27,238
Listen to me, very carefully my friend.

1093
01:27:28,531 --> 01:27:31,576
Killing Shaw will not bring you peace.

1094
01:27:33,286 --> 01:27:35,205
Peace was never an option.

1095
01:28:20,875 --> 01:28:23,795
(Bones cracking)
No.

1096
01:28:25,505 --> 01:28:26,548
No.

1097
01:28:30,218 --> 01:28:32,720
(Clothes tearing, bones cracking)

1098
01:28:55,243 --> 01:28:56,286
Well...

1099
01:28:58,705 --> 01:29:00,039
This is a surprise.

1100
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:01,708
The nice kind?

1101
01:29:03,793 --> 01:29:06,171
No, Raven, I want to go to bed.

1102
01:29:07,422 --> 01:29:08,756
Maybe in a few years.

1103
01:29:13,761 --> 01:29:14,888
(Grown up voice) How about now?

1104
01:29:20,476 --> 01:29:22,020
I prefer the real, Raven.

1105
01:29:25,940 --> 01:29:28,443
I said the real, Raven.

1106
01:29:38,494 --> 01:29:39,871
Perfection.

1107
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:47,545
- Could you pass me my robe?
- You don't have to hide.

1108
01:29:52,550 --> 01:29:55,970
Have you ever looked at a tiger,
and thought you'd want to cover it up?

1109
01:29:58,473 --> 01:30:00,141
No, but...

1110
01:30:00,391 --> 01:30:02,101
You're an exquisite creature, Raven.

1111
01:30:04,062 --> 01:30:06,314
Only in life the world has tried to tame you.

1112
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:08,775
It's time for you to be free.

1113
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:31,422
Raven: You know sometimes I wonder
what my life would have been like.

1114
01:30:31,422 --> 01:30:33,424
If you hadn't found me here that night.

1115
01:30:34,008 --> 01:30:36,219
Fairable, E..gah...ah.

1116
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:39,513
For gods sake, Raven!

1117
01:30:39,597 --> 01:30:41,975
Where are you clothes?
Pu...put some, put some clothes on.

1118
01:30:42,141 --> 01:30:44,393
That's not what you said when you first saw me.

1119
01:30:44,644 --> 01:30:47,688
But I guess pets are always cuter
when they're little, right?

1120
01:30:48,314 --> 01:30:50,458
Raven, I don't know what's got into you lately.

1121
01:30:50,608 --> 01:30:51,734
I thought you'd be in a good mood.

1122
01:30:52,610 --> 01:30:57,490
Hank tells me that he's found the
answer to your cosmetic problem.

1123
01:30:59,784 --> 01:31:02,453
You going to tell me what's the matter?
Or will I have to read your mind?

1124
01:31:02,453 --> 01:31:04,472
You promised me you would never do that.

1125
01:31:04,472 --> 01:31:08,918
Until recently, I never had to use my powers
to know what you were thinking, Raven.

1126
01:31:08,918 --> 01:31:12,630
You know Charles, I used to think
it was gonna be you and me against the world.

1127
01:31:12,922 --> 01:31:16,467
But no matter how bad the world gets,
you don't want to be against it, do you?

1128
01:31:16,509 --> 01:31:17,594
You want to be a part of it.

1129
01:31:39,866 --> 01:31:41,792
What the hell happened here?

1130
01:31:49,667 --> 01:31:53,337
- Hank has been busy.
- Do we really have to wear these?

1131
01:31:53,755 --> 01:31:56,924
As none of us has mutated to endure extreme G force,

1132
01:31:56,933 --> 01:31:59,594
or being riddled by bullets, I suggest we suit up.

1133
01:32:24,536 --> 01:32:25,578
Where's Hank?

1134
01:32:27,747 --> 01:32:28,915
Hank: I'm here.

1135
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:39,676
Hank?

1136
01:32:45,682 --> 01:32:50,061
It didn't attack the cells.
It enhanced them.

1137
01:32:52,564 --> 01:32:53,690
It didn't work.

1138
01:32:54,357 --> 01:32:55,942
Yes it did, Hank.

1139
01:32:56,276 --> 01:33:00,071
Don't you see?
This is who you were meant to be.

1140
01:33:01,197 --> 01:33:02,740
This is you.

1141
01:33:04,576 --> 01:33:05,952
No more hiding.

1142
01:33:06,828 --> 01:33:07,871
Never looked better, man.

1143
01:33:08,413 --> 01:33:09,455
Hank!

1144
01:33:09,455 --> 01:33:10,790
Growls.
(Erik gags)

1145
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,334
Don't mock me.

1146
01:33:13,668 --> 01:33:15,253
Charles: Hank, put him down immediately, please.

1147
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:16,796
Hank...HANK!

1148
01:33:19,549 --> 01:33:21,092
I wasn't.

1149
01:33:21,384 --> 01:33:23,469
Even I got to admit, you look pretty bad ass.

1150
01:33:23,678 --> 01:33:26,890
I think I got a new name for you, Beast.

1151
01:33:26,973 --> 01:33:28,016
(Growls)

1152
01:33:29,267 --> 01:33:33,605
- You sure you can fly this thing?
- Of course I can, I designed it.

1153
01:33:36,149 --> 01:33:39,986
Cuba

1154
01:33:45,867 --> 01:33:47,118
Captain: Status of the cargo ship?

1155
01:33:47,785 --> 01:33:50,914
Lieutenant Commander: Bearing 1-8-0, 12 knots.

1156
01:33:53,124 --> 01:33:55,376
Three minutes to the embargo line, sir.

1157
01:33:56,586 --> 01:33:58,588
God help them if they cross it.

1158
01:34:01,007 --> 01:34:02,509
God help us all.

1159
01:34:03,009 --> 01:34:06,262
- Sound general quarters.
- Officers: General quarters, general quarters.

1160
01:34:06,554 --> 01:34:09,015
- All hands man battle stations!
- Yes sir.

1161
01:34:09,307 --> 01:34:11,100
Lieutenant Commander: Set conditions, zero.

1162
01:34:11,768 --> 01:34:13,978
Man on intercom: General quarters, battle stations.

1163
01:34:23,363 --> 01:34:28,701
Captain, we already have our orders.
Why so eager for new ones?

1164
01:34:29,702 --> 01:34:33,414
I lived through one war, Comrade.

1165
01:34:34,541 --> 01:34:36,626
I'd prefer not to start another.

1166
01:34:39,087 --> 01:34:41,130
Battle stations,
Now!

1167
01:34:44,175 --> 01:34:48,930
Captain: Gun boss, target
cargo ship, bearing 1-8-zero.

1168
01:34:51,015 --> 01:34:54,060
Fleet reports all weapons ready.

1169
01:34:54,227 --> 01:34:56,145
Communications officer: From the Kremlin, sir.

1170
01:34:56,563 --> 01:35:00,608
New orders. As of 1025 hours, the cargo
vessel Aral sea, is hereby ordered to...

1171
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:03,903
...reverse course and return to port in Odessa.

1172
01:35:03,903 --> 01:35:05,363
Communications officer: Aral Sea, come in.

1173
01:35:06,072 --> 01:35:07,740
Aral Sea, come in.

1174
01:35:08,741 --> 01:35:10,159
They are not responding.

1175
01:35:10,159 --> 01:35:11,744
Officer: She's not turning around.

1176
01:35:11,744 --> 01:35:14,372
Aral Sea, you are ordered to turn around.

1177
01:35:14,372 --> 01:35:16,082
Do not cross the line.

1178
01:35:17,041 --> 01:35:18,918
Target ready to be fired upon, sir.

1179
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:21,754
- Stand by to fire.
- Standing by, sir.

1180
01:35:34,392 --> 01:35:36,144
Looks pretty messy out there.

1181
01:35:46,988 --> 01:35:49,991
Russian Communications officer: Aral Sea,
you are ordered to turn around.

1182
01:35:50,825 --> 01:35:53,578
The crew of the Aral Sea are all dead.
Shaw's been there.

1183
01:35:53,578 --> 01:35:55,371
He's still here, somewhere.

1184
01:35:55,371 --> 01:35:56,915
He's set the ship on course for the embargo line.

1185
01:35:57,123 --> 01:35:59,459
That ship crosses the line, our
boys are going to blow it up.

1186
01:35:59,876 --> 01:36:01,294
Moria: And the war begins.

1187
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:04,047
Unless they're not on board.

1188
01:36:06,549 --> 01:36:08,718
USS Independence,
this is, Alexander Nevski.

1189
01:36:09,135 --> 01:36:11,346
Nevski: We have lost control of our cargo ship.

1190
01:36:11,346 --> 01:36:14,140
Nevski: She's been instructed to stop.
Do not fire.

1191
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:15,975
Repeat, do not fire.

1192
01:36:16,017 --> 01:36:17,810
They've signaled their
cargo ship to turn around, sir.

1193
01:36:19,312 --> 01:36:23,233
It's a ruse, pay no attention.
Stand by to fire.

1194
01:36:23,399 --> 01:36:25,610
- Standing by to fire, sir.
- On my count.

1195
01:36:26,152 --> 01:36:27,946
Five...four...

1196
01:36:51,052 --> 01:36:53,388
(Raven screams)
Hold on! Hold on!

1197
01:36:55,265 --> 01:36:56,307
((Roars))

1198
01:37:02,188 --> 01:37:03,022
No!

1199
01:37:07,735 --> 01:37:11,406
- What was that?     - The Russians,
they have fired on their own ship.

1200
01:37:11,948 --> 01:37:13,950
A little warning next time, professor.

1201
01:37:14,075 --> 01:37:14,868
Sorry about that.

1202
01:37:15,076 --> 01:37:16,661
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1203
01:37:17,453 --> 01:37:19,205
Captain: Son of a...

1204
01:37:19,205 --> 01:37:21,541
Give me Sin-clan on the horn, I want a new set of orders.

1205
01:37:25,295 --> 01:37:27,130
Congratulations, Commander.

1206
01:37:27,714 --> 01:37:31,593
You just averted a nuclear war.

1207
01:37:32,093 --> 01:37:33,136
What?

1208
01:37:33,553 --> 01:37:34,971
Take him to the brig.

1209
01:37:35,221 --> 01:37:37,056
What? What just happened?

1210
01:37:38,892 --> 01:37:42,353
They say the comrade lost his mind.
The Americans' are applauding.

1211
01:37:44,731 --> 01:37:45,607
They're here.

1212
01:37:45,857 --> 01:37:47,692
That telepath is powerful.

1213
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:51,863
We're moving to a back-up plan.

1214
01:37:55,283 --> 01:37:57,535
- That was inspired, Charles.
- Thank you very much.

1215
01:37:57,744 --> 01:37:58,995
But I still can't locate Shaw.

1216
01:37:59,245 --> 01:38:01,206
He's down there, we need to find him now.

1217
01:38:01,414 --> 01:38:02,290
Hank?

1218
01:38:02,332 --> 01:38:06,628
- Is there anything unusual on the
radar or scanners?    - No, nothing.

1219
01:38:07,337 --> 01:38:10,924
Well then he must be under water.
And obviously we don't have Sonar.

1220
01:38:12,592 --> 01:38:15,386
- Yes we do.
- Yes we do.

1221
01:38:20,058 --> 01:38:21,667
Shaw: They were ready for war.

1222
01:38:21,668 --> 01:38:24,103
We just need to strike another match
to light the fuse.

1223
01:38:24,354 --> 01:38:27,506
And we still have the most
powerful weapon of all.

1224
01:38:27,857 --> 01:38:28,858
Me.

1225
01:38:29,275 --> 01:38:34,614
Turn the nuclear reactor to 100% output
and make sure I'm not disturbed.

1226
01:38:37,742 --> 01:38:39,869
Hank, level the bloody plane!

1227
01:38:45,291 --> 01:38:47,377
Whoa, you back right off.

1228
01:38:48,336 --> 01:38:50,255
Beast, open the Bombay doors.

1229
01:38:58,513 --> 01:39:02,851
Charles: Remember, this is a muscle.
You control it.

1230
01:39:03,142 --> 01:39:07,188
You'll be in here the entire time.
We'll see you soon.

1231
01:39:07,522 --> 01:39:13,653
- On my mark. 3, 2, 1 GO!
- WHOA!!!

1232
01:39:15,488 --> 01:39:16,531
(Sonic blast hits water)

1233
01:39:29,627 --> 01:39:32,463
Alert the fleet, they may want to take their cams off.

1234
01:39:35,341 --> 01:39:36,384
(Sonic blast whistles through water)

1235
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:39,762
(High pitched feedback)

1236
01:39:45,143 --> 01:39:46,895
Banshee's got a location on Shaw.

1237
01:39:49,647 --> 01:39:50,565
You ready for this?

1238
01:39:51,274 --> 01:39:52,442
Let's find out.

1239
01:40:18,718 --> 01:40:19,761
(Pulsing with power)

1240
01:40:56,464 --> 01:41:00,760
**Remember, the point between rage and serenity.**

1241
01:41:50,852 --> 01:41:51,895
(Engines rev)

1242
01:42:17,086 --> 01:42:19,756
(Winds swirl)

1243
01:42:24,552 --> 01:42:26,137
Erik, take my hand!

1244
01:42:27,013 --> 01:42:30,558
Oh, hold on guys, it's going to get bumpy.

1245
01:42:45,949 --> 01:42:47,826
Erik, take my hand!

1246
01:42:50,870 --> 01:42:53,873
(Rumbling, ship groaning)

1247
01:43:14,769 --> 01:43:16,771
(Screaming, Hank growls)

1248
01:43:21,484 --> 01:43:22,819
Erik: Down.

1249
01:43:29,617 --> 01:43:33,872
(Fires crackling)

1250
01:43:38,251 --> 01:43:41,171
- Moira, Moira, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1251
01:43:46,050 --> 01:43:47,719
I read the teleporter's mind.

1252
01:43:47,969 --> 01:43:49,846
Shaw's drawing all of the power out of his sub.

1253
01:43:50,096 --> 01:43:52,098
He's turning himself into some kind of nuclear bomb.

1254
01:43:52,265 --> 01:43:54,350
We've got no time, the Geiger
counter's going out of control.

1255
01:43:54,517 --> 01:43:55,560
All right Moira, this is what we're going to do.

1256
01:43:55,810 --> 01:43:58,229
Get on the radio and tell them to
clear both fleet's out immediately.

1257
01:43:58,229 --> 01:43:58,980
I'm going in.

1258
01:43:59,230 --> 01:44:01,149
Charles: Beast, Havok, back him up.

1259
01:44:01,149 --> 01:44:03,376
Erik, I can guide you through once you're in.

1260
01:44:03,376 --> 01:44:05,904
Charles: But I need you to shut down
whatever it is that's blocking me.

1261
01:44:05,904 --> 01:44:07,739
Then we just hope to god it's
not to late for me to stop him.

1262
01:44:07,739 --> 01:44:08,948
- Got it.
- Good luck!

1263
01:44:09,741 --> 01:44:11,968
- Charles: Raven, stop!
- I'm going to help them.

1264
01:44:11,968 --> 01:44:12,911
We don't have time for this.

1265
01:44:12,911 --> 01:44:15,705
Anything comes in that entrance,
you're taking care of it, yes?

1266
01:44:16,122 --> 01:44:16,831
Fine.

1267
01:44:33,097 --> 01:44:34,140
Beeeeaast!

1268
01:44:37,936 --> 01:44:39,771
If we go, you go

1269
01:44:42,982 --> 01:44:45,276
We believe Shaw is trying to
detonate some kind of bomb.

1270
01:44:50,532 --> 01:44:55,161
Erik, make for the middle of the vessel.
That's the point my mind can't penetrate.

1271
01:44:55,161 --> 01:44:57,371
We have to assume that, that's where Shaw is.

1272
01:45:06,005 --> 01:45:07,549
Gang way, gang way.

1273
01:45:10,426 --> 01:45:11,469
(Sparks flying)

1274
01:45:14,931 --> 01:45:17,851
That's the nuclear reactor.
Disable it.

1275
01:45:29,988 --> 01:45:31,739
Navy officer: Stop, don't move.

1276
01:45:37,203 --> 01:45:38,246
((wings fluttering))

1277
01:45:39,664 --> 01:45:40,748
Get down!

1278
01:46:04,814 --> 01:46:06,357
Charles: **Erik you're there, you've reached the void.**

1279
01:46:06,441 --> 01:46:08,318
He's not here Charles,
Shaw is not here.

1280
01:46:08,401 --> 01:46:10,570
- He's left the sub.
- What? He's got to be there.

1281
01:46:10,820 --> 01:46:13,114
He has to be, there's no where
else he can be, keep looking.

1282
01:46:13,156 --> 01:46:15,742
And I'm telling you he's not,
there's no one here, god damn it!

1283
01:46:19,454 --> 01:46:23,249
Shaw: Erik, what a pleasant surprise.

1284
01:46:23,249 --> 01:46:25,001
Erik?
Erik!

1285
01:46:27,378 --> 01:46:28,755
So good to see you again.

1286
01:46:45,730 --> 01:46:47,315
Shaw: May I ask you something?

1287
01:46:48,942 --> 01:46:50,485
Why are you on their side?

1288
01:46:50,985 --> 01:46:52,228
- He's gone.
- What?

1289
01:46:52,228 --> 01:46:55,240
He's gone into the void. I can't
communicate with him there.

1290
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:58,309
Why fight for a doomed race
who will hunt us down,

1291
01:46:58,309 --> 01:47:00,662
...as soon as they realize
their reign is coming to an end.

1292
01:47:08,586 --> 01:47:11,047
(Alarm blaring)

1293
01:47:13,049 --> 01:47:14,092
(Sonic boom)

1294
01:47:27,856 --> 01:47:28,898
(Alex joyfully laughs)

1295
01:47:29,399 --> 01:47:30,775
Alex: Yeah!

1296
01:47:44,539 --> 01:47:46,624
I'm sorry for what happened in the camps.

1297
01:47:48,751 --> 01:47:50,170
I truly am.

1298
01:47:53,214 --> 01:47:54,257
(Glass shatters)

1299
01:47:58,678 --> 01:47:59,679
He's back.

1300
01:48:00,054 --> 01:48:03,724
**Erik, whatever you're doing keep
doing it, it's starting to work.**

1301
01:48:04,309 --> 01:48:07,562
But everything I did,
I did for you.

1302
01:48:07,645 --> 01:48:11,941
To unlock your power. To make
you...embrace it.

1303
01:48:15,111 --> 01:48:16,321
**It's working.**

1304
01:48:16,321 --> 01:48:19,240
I'm starting to see him, but I
can't yet touch his mind.

1305
01:48:19,365 --> 01:48:20,408
(Wings fluttering)

1306
01:48:25,079 --> 01:48:26,122
(Released Plasma blast)

1307
01:48:31,878 --> 01:48:32,921
(Laughs with relief)

1308
01:48:33,046 --> 01:48:35,632
You've come a long way from bending gates.

1309
01:48:36,132 --> 01:48:37,925
I'm so proud of you.

1310
01:48:45,725 --> 01:48:48,394
And you're just starting to scratch the surface.

1311
01:48:48,603 --> 01:48:52,941
Think how much further we could go, together.

1312
01:49:07,038 --> 01:49:08,081
Roars

1313
01:49:12,836 --> 01:49:15,088
Stop, Azazel!

1314
01:49:30,061 --> 01:49:32,939
I don't want to hurt you, Erik.
I never did.

1315
01:49:33,523 --> 01:49:34,691
I want to help you.

1316
01:49:34,941 --> 01:49:38,278
This is our time.
Our age.

1317
01:49:39,237 --> 01:49:42,532
We are the future of the human race.

1318
01:49:43,616 --> 01:49:47,996
You and me, son.
This world could be ours.

1319
01:49:50,331 --> 01:49:53,418
Everything you did, made me stronger.

1320
01:49:55,211 --> 01:49:57,172
Made me the weapon I am today.

1321
01:49:59,465 --> 01:50:00,675
That's the truth.

1322
01:50:02,302 --> 01:50:03,928
I've known it all along.

1323
01:50:10,435 --> 01:50:11,936
You are my creator.

1324
01:50:12,604 --> 01:50:14,314
- NOW, Charles!
- AHHH!

1325
01:50:15,815 --> 01:50:16,524
Are you okay?

1326
01:50:16,774 --> 01:50:20,127
Moira be quiet, I can only
control this man for so long.

1327
01:50:20,278 --> 01:50:21,321
(Metal clatters on floor)

1328
01:50:33,041 --> 01:50:34,792
Sorry, Charles.

1329
01:50:34,792 --> 01:50:37,336
**Erik please, be the better man.
You have it in...**

1330
01:50:37,336 --> 01:50:37,921
But I donâ€™t trust you.

1331
01:50:37,921 --> 01:50:39,922
** Erik, there will be no telling what...**

1332
01:50:41,090 --> 01:50:42,091
No.

1333
01:50:43,051 --> 01:50:44,969
- Moira: Charles?
- Don't do this, Erik!

1334
01:50:52,185 --> 01:50:57,448
If you're in there, I'd like you to know
that I agree with every word you've said.

1335
01:50:59,317 --> 01:51:01,069
We are the future.

1336
01:51:03,571 --> 01:51:04,948
But...

1337
01:51:06,407 --> 01:51:10,369
...unfortunately, you killed my mother.

1338
01:51:19,170 --> 01:51:21,088
This is what we're going to do.

1339
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:23,224
No, please Erik, no.

1340
01:51:23,258 --> 01:51:27,386
I'm going to count to three.
And I'm going to move the coin.

1341
01:51:28,930 --> 01:51:30,139
One...

1342
01:51:31,891 --> 01:51:33,518
Please, Erik.

1343
01:51:38,147 --> 01:51:39,190
(Panting)

1344
01:51:41,651 --> 01:51:42,861
Two...

1345
01:51:49,742 --> 01:51:50,869
Three.

1346
01:51:52,745 --> 01:51:54,664
Aaaaaaaah!

1347
01:52:12,724 --> 01:52:13,766
(Clatters on floor)

1348
01:52:20,106 --> 01:52:22,942
Stryker: The Russians share our concerns.

1349
01:52:23,193 --> 01:52:26,362
And will join a strike on all the mutants.

1350
01:52:26,362 --> 01:52:28,198
We can end this threat for good.

1351
01:52:28,406 --> 01:52:30,683
We'll never have another opportunity like this.

1352
01:52:30,683 --> 01:52:32,327
We have an agent on that beach.

1353
01:52:32,327 --> 01:52:35,455
- One agent.
- She's a good agent.

1354
01:52:35,705 --> 01:52:37,623
She's collateral damage.

1355
01:52:43,046 --> 01:52:45,215
Erik: Today our fighting stops.

1356
01:53:09,906 --> 01:53:12,742
Take off your blinders, brothers and sisters.

1357
01:53:13,117 --> 01:53:15,369
The real enemy is out there.

1358
01:53:16,663 --> 01:53:19,165
Erik: I feel their guns moving in the water.

1359
01:53:19,165 --> 01:53:21,776
Their metal targeting us.

1360
01:53:21,779 --> 01:53:25,505
Americans, Soviets, humans.

1361
01:53:26,673 --> 01:53:29,258
United in their fear of the unknown.

1362
01:53:30,176 --> 01:53:33,971
Erik: A Neanderthal is running scared,
my fellow mutants.

1363
01:53:36,266 --> 01:53:37,517
Go ahead, Charles.

1364
01:53:39,811 --> 01:53:41,271
Tell me I'm wrong.

1365
01:53:47,193 --> 01:53:49,362
(Turrets shifting, alarm blaring)

1366
01:54:01,541 --> 01:54:05,795
Fleet commander this is X-ray Bravo-7-zero.
Respond, over.

1367
01:54:07,005 --> 01:54:09,991
The beach is secure, call off the attack.

1368
01:54:09,991 --> 01:54:12,435
The beach is targeted and ready to
be fired upon, sir.

1369
01:54:12,435 --> 01:54:14,220
- Stand by.
- Officer: Standing by, sir.

1370
01:54:18,641 --> 01:54:19,684
Hello?

1371
01:54:21,811 --> 01:54:22,854
Hello!

1372
01:54:30,945 --> 01:54:33,656
- Fire.
- Fire.

1373
01:54:51,466 --> 01:54:52,509
(Missiles whistle in air)

1374
01:55:21,996 --> 01:55:23,998
Erik, you said yourself, we're the better men.

1375
01:55:24,874 --> 01:55:26,251
Charles: This is the time to prove it.

1376
01:55:30,296 --> 01:55:34,675
There are thousands of men on those ships.
getting orders, innocent men.

1377
01:55:34,759 --> 01:55:36,511
They're just following orders.

1378
01:55:38,721 --> 01:55:41,182
I've been at the mercy of men
just following orders.

1379
01:55:45,728 --> 01:55:47,105
Never again.

1380
01:55:51,734 --> 01:55:53,069
Erik, release them.

1381
01:55:59,993 --> 01:56:01,578
Noooo!

1382
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:09,752
Erik: I don't want to hurt you,
don't make me.

1383
01:56:10,837 --> 01:56:12,130
Stay back!

1384
01:56:14,841 --> 01:56:16,050
Charles, enough.

1385
01:56:21,014 --> 01:56:22,140
Erik, stop!

1386
01:56:32,609 --> 01:56:35,153
Gentlemen, it's been an honor serving with you.

1387
01:56:45,246 --> 01:56:46,289
(Bullet ricochets)

1388
01:57:24,744 --> 01:57:26,371
(Charles grunts with pain)
I'm so sorry.

1389
01:57:26,371 --> 01:57:27,872
I said back off!

1390
01:57:30,041 --> 01:57:32,460
You, you did this!

1391
01:57:36,631 --> 01:57:40,176
(Moria choking)
Charles: Please...

1392
01:57:41,261 --> 01:57:45,014
She didn't do this, Erik.
You did.

1393
01:57:52,981 --> 01:57:56,651
Us turning on each other,
it's what they want.

1394
01:57:57,026 --> 01:57:58,945
I tried to warn you, Charles.

1395
01:58:01,406 --> 01:58:05,577
I want you by my side.
We're brothers, you and I.

1396
01:58:06,327 --> 01:58:09,289
All of us, together. Protecting each other.

1397
01:58:11,416 --> 01:58:13,251
We want the same thing.

1398
01:58:14,669 --> 01:58:16,087
Oh, my friend.

1399
01:58:16,796 --> 01:58:20,049
I'm sorry, but we do not.

1400
01:58:36,316 --> 01:58:42,155
- Charles, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, Charles.
- Charles: It's all right, it's all right.

1401
01:58:43,323 --> 01:58:45,408
(Charles grunts with pain)

1402
01:58:46,284 --> 01:58:48,328
His society won't accept us.

1403
01:58:49,662 --> 01:58:51,289
We form our own.

1404
01:58:51,414 --> 01:58:53,458
The humans have played their hand.

1405
01:58:55,752 --> 01:58:58,087
Now we get ready to play ours.

1406
01:59:00,882 --> 01:59:02,258
Who's with me?

1407
01:59:13,895 --> 01:59:15,313
No more hiding.

1408
01:59:34,207 --> 01:59:35,250
(Charles groans)

1409
01:59:41,673 --> 01:59:46,219
You, you should go with him.
It's what you want.

1410
01:59:46,970 --> 01:59:49,180
You promised me you would never read my mind.

1411
01:59:49,722 --> 01:59:50,682
I know.

1412
01:59:51,307 --> 01:59:53,935
I promised you a great many things,
I'm afraid.

1413
01:59:54,686 --> 01:59:55,728
I'm sorry.

1414
02:00:01,109 --> 02:00:02,527
Take care of him.

1415
02:00:18,001 --> 02:00:20,628
And Beast, never forget.

1416
02:00:21,546 --> 02:00:24,591
Mutant and proud.

1417
02:00:33,057 --> 02:00:34,434
Help me out, help him.

1418
02:00:35,518 --> 02:00:40,798
- I'm going to get you to a hospital.
- Wait, don't, Charles, don't move, okay.

1419
02:00:40,798 --> 02:00:45,945
All right, actually I ca.....I...I...

1420
02:00:48,114 --> 02:00:50,091
I can't feel my legs

1421
02:00:51,618 --> 02:00:53,244
I can't feel my legs.

1422
02:00:55,288 --> 02:00:57,456
I can't feel my legs.

1423
02:01:08,801 --> 02:01:12,930
Kennedy: In this week of thanksgiving.
There is much for which we can be grateful.

1424
02:01:12,939 --> 02:01:16,434
As you look back to where we stood,
only four weeks ago.

1425
02:01:16,436 --> 02:01:19,521
The unity of this hemisphere,
the support of our allies.

1426
02:01:19,521 --> 02:01:22,523
And the calm determination of the American people.

1427
02:01:22,524 --> 02:01:27,194
These qualities may be tested many
more times. In this decade.

1428
02:01:29,906 --> 02:01:32,242
Moria: So how many students
do you think you'll have here?

1429
02:01:32,242 --> 02:01:34,785
Once you get the academy up and running.

1430
02:01:34,786 --> 02:01:38,665
As many as I can manage. Possibly more.

1431
02:01:41,709 --> 02:01:46,564
You know, one day the government is going
to realize how lucky they were,

1432
02:01:46,564 --> 02:01:48,774
...to have Professor X on their side.

1433
02:01:49,801 --> 02:01:52,178
I guess I've been on the
road to a professor now, aren't I.

1434
02:01:52,178 --> 02:01:53,805
Next thing I'll be going bald.

1435
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:57,809
We're still on the governmentâ€™s side, Moira.

1436
02:01:58,393 --> 02:02:01,062
Still a G-man, just without the G.

1437
02:02:01,437 --> 02:02:04,315
No, you're your own team now.

1438
02:02:05,108 --> 02:02:06,234
It's better.

1439
02:02:07,318 --> 02:02:10,071
You're, "X-Men".

1440
02:02:10,405 --> 02:02:11,447
(Laughing)

1441
02:02:12,282 --> 02:02:13,783
Yes, I like the sound of that.

1442
02:02:14,325 --> 02:02:20,290
Moira, for us anonymity will be the first line of defense.

1443
02:02:20,290 --> 02:02:21,583
I know.

1444
02:02:23,251 --> 02:02:26,963
They can threaten me all they want, Charles.

1445
02:02:27,797 --> 02:02:30,091
I'll never tell them where you are.

1446
02:02:30,675 --> 02:02:31,718
Ever.

1447
02:02:32,635 --> 02:02:37,765
I know you won't... My love.

1448
02:02:44,898 --> 02:02:47,192
I remember the attack on HQ.

1449
02:02:47,775 --> 02:02:49,527
Leaving to go somewhere else.

1450
02:02:50,195 --> 02:02:53,364
And then this morning, I woke up at home.

1451
02:02:54,240 --> 02:02:55,283
That's it.

1452
02:02:56,493 --> 02:02:59,003
McCone: All that time wiped clean from your mind.

1453
02:02:59,037 --> 02:03:00,205
Just gone.

1454
02:03:00,580 --> 02:03:02,582
He can do that.
You don't remember anything?

1455
02:03:03,166 --> 02:03:10,924
Sometimes I get fragments.
Like trees, sunlight.

1456
02:03:13,092 --> 02:03:15,929
- A kiss.
- Aw, Jesus.

1457
02:03:16,471 --> 02:03:19,974
Gentlemen, this is why the CIA
is no place for a woman.

1458
02:03:20,808 --> 02:03:21,851
(Loud explosion)

1459
02:03:25,021 --> 02:03:26,147
What the hell was that?

1460
02:03:33,780 --> 02:03:36,950
(Metal door creaking)

1461
02:03:42,872 --> 02:03:45,083
Erik: I know we've had our differences.

1462
02:03:47,710 --> 02:03:51,631
- Where's your telepath friend?
- Erik: Gone.

1463
02:03:52,674 --> 02:03:55,802
Left a bit of a gap in my life.
If I'm to be honest.

1464
02:03:55,802 --> 02:03:57,762
I was rather hoping you would fill it.

1465
02:04:03,142 --> 02:04:04,227
Erik: Join us.

1466
02:04:11,651 --> 02:04:13,069
Erik, I believe.

1467
02:04:16,447 --> 02:04:18,158
I prefer...

1468
02:04:20,160 --> 02:04:21,777
...Magneto.
