1
00:00:04,466 --> 00:00:07,383
(theatrical music)

2
00:01:38,785 --> 00:01:41,202
(laser fire)

3
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:47,604
(wall crumbling)

4
00:01:51,292 --> 00:01:54,096
(eerie music)

5
00:01:54,096 --> 00:01:55,572
- [Voiceover] Yeah
that's what he tells me.

6
00:01:55,572 --> 00:01:56,521
- [Voiceover] What is that?

7
00:01:56,521 --> 00:01:58,938
(explosions)

8
00:02:05,676 --> 00:02:06,676
- Avalanche.

9
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:10,479
(dramatic music)

10
00:02:38,948 --> 00:02:41,198
(growling)

11
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,125
(screeching)

12
00:02:47,187 --> 00:02:50,577
(dramatic music)

13
00:02:50,577 --> 00:02:52,530
(screeching)

14
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,780
(growling)

15
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,567
(screeching)

16
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:10,633
(dramatic music)

17
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:36,252
(crashing and glass breaking)

18
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:42,249
(dramatic music)

19
00:03:52,397 --> 00:03:54,647
(growling)

20
00:03:58,175 --> 00:04:00,758
(upbeat music)

21
00:04:26,942 --> 00:04:30,275
(light whimsical music)

22
00:04:33,505 --> 00:04:35,672
(snoring)

23
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:49,917
(upbeat cartoon music)

24
00:04:54,719 --> 00:04:57,386
(ominous music)

25
00:04:59,044 --> 00:05:01,965
- Tommy, we've got to talk.

26
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:02,798
- Uh.

27
00:05:07,153 --> 00:05:08,320
- Tommy hello.

28
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,194
- You can't be real.

29
00:05:13,724 --> 00:05:16,120
- I'm real but I'm not solid.

30
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,411
Actually I'm a mental
image being projected

31
00:05:18,411 --> 00:05:19,938
directly into the visual

32
00:05:19,938 --> 00:05:22,539
and auditory centers of your brain.

33
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:25,372
Nobody but you can see or hear me.

34
00:05:26,923 --> 00:05:27,756
Hey.

35
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,117
- Then why are you here?

36
00:05:33,117 --> 00:05:34,621
- You've been selected by a coalition

37
00:05:34,621 --> 00:05:35,758
of intelligent species

38
00:05:35,758 --> 00:05:37,846
in the galaxy to defend your planet

39
00:05:37,846 --> 00:05:39,464
against an invader.

40
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,559
If you fail,

41
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:43,620
you and your entire
civilization will be destroyed.

42
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,537
Understand?

43
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:48,250
- Okay.

44
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,210
(eerie music)

45
00:06:04,004 --> 00:06:05,645
And I'm supposed to believe this?

46
00:06:05,645 --> 00:06:06,728
- [Girl] Yup.

47
00:06:13,496 --> 00:06:16,863
- So you're from some extremely
advanced civilization,

48
00:06:16,863 --> 00:06:17,949
is that right?

49
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:19,199
- That's right.

50
00:06:21,096 --> 00:06:25,263
- Well how come you look like
a tiny teenage mall tramp?

51
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,048
- Well it's simply a
conventionalized projection

52
00:06:33,048 --> 00:06:36,715
designed to look familiar
and unthreatening.

53
00:06:40,548 --> 00:06:43,481
- So if you're from an
advanced civilization

54
00:06:43,481 --> 00:06:45,898
can I ask you some questions?

55
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,722
- Well some things I cannot tell you,

56
00:06:48,722 --> 00:06:50,321
but I'll do my best.

57
00:06:50,321 --> 00:06:51,502
- All right.

58
00:06:51,502 --> 00:06:54,060
All right what's the meaning of life?

59
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,576
- There is no meaning.

60
00:06:55,576 --> 00:06:57,317
It's just a coincidental outcome

61
00:06:57,317 --> 00:07:01,484
of the particular quanto
crystallization of our universe.

62
00:07:02,473 --> 00:07:04,742
- Is there life after death?

63
00:07:04,742 --> 00:07:05,575
- No.

64
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:08,978
- I mean does our spirit,

65
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:12,053
our consciousness continue
to exist even after the death

66
00:07:12,053 --> 00:07:14,326
of our physical bodies?

67
00:07:14,326 --> 00:07:15,159
- No.

68
00:07:17,476 --> 00:07:19,621
- Does Wendy Physcs really like me?

69
00:07:19,621 --> 00:07:23,001
- No, she's using you to
make Arnie Beckworth jealous.

70
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:25,076
She's also been sleeping
with George Winston

71
00:07:25,076 --> 00:07:27,204
on the side in order to get
better work assignments.

72
00:07:27,204 --> 00:07:29,037
- I knew it, damn her.

73
00:07:31,021 --> 00:07:32,569
Look this is completely ridiculous,

74
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:34,391
I'm sorry and pardon me for saying so

75
00:07:34,391 --> 00:07:37,180
but why in the world
would a galactic whatever

76
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,504
pick me to defend the earth?

77
00:07:39,504 --> 00:07:41,265
I mean there'd have to be a lot of people

78
00:07:41,265 --> 00:07:43,571
better suited for this particular job.

79
00:07:43,571 --> 00:07:44,904
- Oh sure, half.

80
00:07:47,622 --> 00:07:48,701
- I'm sorry.

81
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,386
- Exactly half of the people on the earth

82
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,695
are better suited to defeat
the invader than you.

83
00:07:52,695 --> 00:07:54,773
And exactly half are worse.

84
00:07:54,773 --> 00:07:56,177
You're dead in the center.

85
00:07:56,177 --> 00:07:58,427
That's why we selected you.

86
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:02,083
- So who's this invader?

87
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,834
- You mean you don't know.

88
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:05,877
- Why should I know?

89
00:08:05,877 --> 00:08:08,127
It's been on every channel.

90
00:08:10,138 --> 00:08:13,349
Except for the possible
exception of the cartoon network.

91
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:14,590
Go ahead and switch,

92
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,507
you'll see.

93
00:08:18,211 --> 00:08:19,273
- Stan Chambers here,

94
00:08:19,273 --> 00:08:21,620
reporting on the Aurora Mountain disaster,

95
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,075
we're having trouble with
our live transmission feed

96
00:08:24,075 --> 00:08:25,771
from Aurora Valley.

97
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,488
For you viewers who just tuned in

98
00:08:27,488 --> 00:08:31,511
we're in the middle of
a truly amazing story.

99
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,858
- Well amazing's the word Stan,

100
00:08:32,858 --> 00:08:34,294
a gigantic animal,

101
00:08:34,294 --> 00:08:37,358
of apparently prehistoric
origin has somehow emerged

102
00:08:37,358 --> 00:08:39,116
from the side of Mount Aurora,

103
00:08:39,116 --> 00:08:41,004
in Aurora County California.

104
00:08:41,004 --> 00:08:42,576
Now the animal of unknown species

105
00:08:42,576 --> 00:08:45,007
we understand is currently
making its way in

106
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:46,422
a north to north easterly direction

107
00:08:46,422 --> 00:08:48,954
but already it's caused massive damage

108
00:08:48,954 --> 00:08:52,104
even loss of life in
the Aurora Valley area.

109
00:08:52,104 --> 00:08:53,262
- Just one moment Elizabeth.

110
00:08:53,262 --> 00:08:54,769
We do have an update,

111
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:56,870
Governor Bill Wilkins has called out the

112
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,041
California national guard

113
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:02,121
and the forces are moving
into the Aurora Valley area.

114
00:09:02,121 --> 00:09:03,670
- Stan I'm getting word
now that we're getting back

115
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,827
to our live feed,

116
00:09:04,827 --> 00:09:06,907
so I think we should switch
live to Marty Carlson

117
00:09:06,907 --> 00:09:09,131
right in the Aurora Valley.

118
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,605
- Stan, Elizabeth,

119
00:09:10,605 --> 00:09:12,968
I am standing on main street in front

120
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:15,501
of the county court
house in what used to be

121
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:18,070
the heart of Aurora County.

122
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,329
It is now a virtual ghost town.

123
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:25,053
The entire Aurora Valley
has been ordered evacuated.

124
00:09:25,053 --> 00:09:28,748
This is due entirely to a
unprecedented natural disaster.

125
00:09:28,748 --> 00:09:32,831
The cause a single incredibly
destructive animal.

126
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,839
What you are hearing now from behind me

127
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,111
is the sound of that animal as it moves

128
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:41,768
through the center of town
literally knocking buildings down

129
00:09:41,768 --> 00:09:43,287
as it advances.

130
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:45,162
It appears to be heading
in this direction,

131
00:09:45,162 --> 00:09:46,039
I,

132
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:50,057
I don't know how much longer
we'll be able to (screaming).

133
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:53,352
- Oh, oh Stan something
appears to be so wrong.

134
00:09:53,352 --> 00:09:56,739
- We are apparently having
some transmission problems.

135
00:09:56,739 --> 00:10:00,378
We'll get back to Marty
just as soon as we can.

136
00:10:00,378 --> 00:10:01,669
- [Voiceover] Across
America starting at ...

137
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:04,130
- We'll be bringing you
that interview in full

138
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,072
in just a little while.

139
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,187
Once again this is Debbie Delverson

140
00:10:08,187 --> 00:10:11,542
coming to you from WRPT here in New Ark.

141
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:14,045
Bringing you the latest in that terrifying

142
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:15,568
story on the west coast.

143
00:10:15,568 --> 00:10:17,366
Right now we have Dr Stephanie Martin

144
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,150
from the university of Trenton.

145
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,677
She is a Crypto Zoologist,

146
00:10:20,677 --> 00:10:23,402
she's an expert in the study
of unknown animal life.

147
00:10:23,402 --> 00:10:25,703
Thank you Dr Martin for being with us.

148
00:10:25,703 --> 00:10:27,102
- It's my pleasure.

149
00:10:27,102 --> 00:10:28,835
- So what, is the deal here?

150
00:10:28,835 --> 00:10:31,039
Is this a dinosaur
that's come back to life?

151
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,045
- Well I know that it's being
referred to as a dinosaur

152
00:10:34,045 --> 00:10:36,735
by the popular media but in a word,

153
00:10:36,735 --> 00:10:37,568
no.

154
00:10:39,214 --> 00:10:42,241
As you can see there are a
number of characteristics

155
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:46,480
that make it very unlikely
that this animal is a dinosaur.

156
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,647
Well you'll notice the human like arms

157
00:10:50,588 --> 00:10:52,777
and the structure of the skull

158
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,783
and then of course the size of the animal

159
00:10:55,783 --> 00:10:58,042
which is far larger than any

160
00:10:58,042 --> 00:11:01,172
(mumbles) animal known to science.

161
00:11:01,172 --> 00:11:04,094
Or even really considered
to be possible by science.

162
00:11:04,094 --> 00:11:05,632
- But don't you think
this could be a species

163
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:07,546
that's not known by science?

164
00:11:07,546 --> 00:11:09,416
- Well no not really.

165
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:12,166
Well in fact it's impossible that

166
00:11:13,751 --> 00:11:16,641
a dinosaur could have been
living inside of Mount Aurora

167
00:11:16,641 --> 00:11:18,356
for 65 million years.

168
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:21,372
You see Mount Aurora is only
around 22 million years old.

169
00:11:21,372 --> 00:11:24,963
In fact Mount Aurora was
formed by alluvial deposits

170
00:11:24,963 --> 00:11:26,394
that were made--

171
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,227
- Thank you Dr Martin.

172
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:34,273
- Let's show you that footage again.

173
00:11:36,641 --> 00:11:39,391
(static hissing)

174
00:11:40,884 --> 00:11:43,040
- We'll be staying on the
air to keep you updated

175
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,688
on this amazing story.

176
00:11:44,688 --> 00:11:46,964
A terrible visitor from
some lost prehistoric world

177
00:11:46,964 --> 00:11:50,088
alive in Southern California.

178
00:11:50,088 --> 00:11:54,255
- Monster (speaking in
a foreign language).

179
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:02,804
- It is clearly well over 180 feet tall,

180
00:12:02,804 --> 00:12:06,834
which in fact would make
it by far the largest

181
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:07,871
animal in the world.

182
00:12:07,871 --> 00:12:11,413
Far more massive than even the blue whale.

183
00:12:11,413 --> 00:12:15,104
Well which would make it very unlikely

184
00:12:15,104 --> 00:12:18,758
that this is a dinosaur
or any creature evolved

185
00:12:18,758 --> 00:12:19,890
here on earth.

186
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:23,210
- [Voiceover] Thank you Dr
Martin so much that information.

187
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,877
- Could you turn the sound down?

188
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:28,757
- [Debbie] Once again
this is Debbie Dolverson

189
00:12:28,757 --> 00:12:30,174
coming to you ...

190
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,013
- Are you okay?

191
00:12:34,013 --> 00:12:35,503
(ominous music)

192
00:12:35,503 --> 00:12:37,070
- Yeah,

193
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,280
yeah great.

194
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,113
Swell.

195
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,791
- Are you functional now?

196
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,223
Can you listen to me?

197
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,473
- Yeah, yeah I'm listening.

198
00:12:48,964 --> 00:12:51,131
- Okay ground rules first.

199
00:12:52,524 --> 00:12:54,774
Zarkorr cannot be defeated.

200
00:12:56,756 --> 00:12:57,625
- Zarkorr,

201
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:58,690
who's Zarkorr?

202
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,571
- That's the invader.

203
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:00,404
Zarkorr.

204
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,988
Now Zarkorr cannot be
defeated by any earthly

205
00:13:03,988 --> 00:13:05,682
weapon utilized or,

206
00:13:05,682 --> 00:13:07,432
here write this down.

207
00:13:09,528 --> 00:13:11,058
I can only tell you this once,

208
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:12,867
so it's important that
you get it straight.

209
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:14,846
- I have a tape recorder.

210
00:13:14,846 --> 00:13:17,279
- I'm speaking directly
to your cerebral cortex.

211
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,825
What good is a tape recorder going the be?

212
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:20,658
- Okay.

213
00:13:21,882 --> 00:13:23,299
Okay, okay, okay.

214
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:26,402
Point one,

215
00:13:26,402 --> 00:13:29,754
Zarkorr cannot be defeated
by any earthly currently

216
00:13:29,754 --> 00:13:33,389
utilized or in development by
any armed force on the earth.

217
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:34,306
Understand?

218
00:13:37,126 --> 00:13:38,683
- What about nuclear weapons?

219
00:13:38,683 --> 00:13:40,184
- Nothing, nada.

220
00:13:40,184 --> 00:13:44,486
Not guns, tanks, A bombs,
H bombs, anthrax bombs,

221
00:13:44,486 --> 00:13:47,864
slingshots, swords, sharp sticks,

222
00:13:47,864 --> 00:13:51,101
poison gas nothing that
is currently utilized

223
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:54,336
or under development by any
armed force on the earth.

224
00:13:54,336 --> 00:13:55,586
- Right got it.

225
00:13:57,731 --> 00:14:01,884
- However the means do
exist to defeat the invader.

226
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,656
They exist here on earth,

227
00:14:03,656 --> 00:14:06,499
and they can be found and utilized by you,

228
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:09,299
within the limited time frame available.

229
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:11,792
- What do you mean limited time frame?

230
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:13,238
- That's the next point.

231
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:15,835
Zarkorr has been designed
to hone in on you

232
00:14:15,835 --> 00:14:17,334
and is currently making his way to you

233
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:18,984
by the shortest route possible.

234
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:21,821
So if you're thinking
about dodging the mission

235
00:14:21,821 --> 00:14:25,619
by running away, this would
be a very temporary solution.

236
00:14:25,619 --> 00:14:28,020
Zarkorr would track you down.

237
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,373
Where ever you ended up, he'd kill you.

238
00:14:30,373 --> 00:14:32,444
You cannot hide from Zarkorr.

239
00:14:32,444 --> 00:14:33,277
Got it?

240
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:35,441
- Got it.

241
00:14:37,856 --> 00:14:40,174
But how am I supposed to kill it?

242
00:14:40,174 --> 00:14:41,985
- Next point.

243
00:14:41,985 --> 00:14:45,319
Your course of action
is strictly up to you.

244
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:47,524
You can use whatever
resources you can find,

245
00:14:47,524 --> 00:14:50,070
technical resources, scientific resources,

246
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,779
human resources.

247
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:54,365
Other than what I'm telling you now

248
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:56,448
we can offer you no assistance whatever.

249
00:14:56,448 --> 00:14:57,615
Write it down.

250
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,615
- Yeah, no assistance whatever.

251
00:15:01,615 --> 00:15:03,115
Look I'm sorry but

252
00:15:04,327 --> 00:15:07,335
I thought superior beings were

253
00:15:07,335 --> 00:15:09,154
supposed to be morally superior.

254
00:15:09,154 --> 00:15:10,304
I need to tell you something there

255
00:15:10,304 --> 00:15:12,123
is nothing moral about this,

256
00:15:12,123 --> 00:15:13,385
this is totally immoral.

257
00:15:13,385 --> 00:15:14,864
You cannot do this to me,

258
00:15:14,864 --> 00:15:15,697
or us.

259
00:15:16,897 --> 00:15:18,147
The human race.

260
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,749
- We're superior beings,

261
00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:23,769
so our moral code allows us to do

262
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:26,269
whatever we want to do to you.

263
00:15:27,354 --> 00:15:28,854
- Great what else?

264
00:15:29,798 --> 00:15:33,542
- Well, um, that's really about it.

265
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:35,149
Oh one hint

266
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:39,149
Zarkorr contains the key
to his own destruction.

267
00:15:41,724 --> 00:15:43,141
So uh, good luck.

268
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:45,526
Bye.

269
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:49,937
Oh one other thing that
I'm allowed to tell you

270
00:15:49,937 --> 00:15:52,549
the faster you undertake positivity action

271
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:56,716
against the invader, the
greater the chances of success.

272
00:15:58,512 --> 00:15:59,345
Bye.

273
00:16:01,841 --> 00:16:02,936
- How in Gods name am I supposed

274
00:16:02,936 --> 00:16:05,353
to fight a 180 foot dinosaur?

275
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:10,849
(dramatic music)

276
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:13,927
(growling)

277
00:16:13,927 --> 00:16:16,677
(dramatic music)

278
00:16:37,514 --> 00:16:39,055
(explosions)

279
00:16:39,055 --> 00:16:41,010
(screeching)

280
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,760
(dramatic music)

281
00:17:30,808 --> 00:17:33,808
(crickets chirping)

282
00:18:16,151 --> 00:18:19,234
(incoherent talking)

283
00:18:33,257 --> 00:18:36,496
- Okay people we'll be
back in two minutes.

284
00:18:36,496 --> 00:18:37,857
- Oh god.

285
00:18:37,857 --> 00:18:39,342
Do we have any new footage

286
00:18:39,342 --> 00:18:40,600
or anything.

287
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,767
What am I supposed to say?

288
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:47,495
So where's the Crisco zoologist?

289
00:18:47,495 --> 00:18:48,676
Huh, huh.

290
00:18:48,676 --> 00:18:49,843
- In wardrobe.

291
00:18:56,454 --> 00:18:58,434
- Excuse me can you tell me where

292
00:18:58,434 --> 00:18:59,880
the wardrobe department is?

293
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,287
- It's in the corner over that way.

294
00:19:02,287 --> 00:19:03,120
- Thanks.

295
00:19:04,387 --> 00:19:06,387
- Is she a bore or what?

296
00:19:08,632 --> 00:19:10,285
And then I try to get her to shut up

297
00:19:10,285 --> 00:19:14,014
and she just keeps going on and on and on.

298
00:19:14,014 --> 00:19:16,442
(banging)

299
00:19:16,442 --> 00:19:17,942
- Oh, sorry.

300
00:19:17,942 --> 00:19:19,063
- Wait you're the expert, right?

301
00:19:19,063 --> 00:19:20,282
- Yeah I guess.

302
00:19:20,282 --> 00:19:21,223
- I need to talk to you.

303
00:19:21,223 --> 00:19:22,538
It's very important.

304
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:24,588
- Okay well look I got to be
back on the air in a couple

305
00:19:24,588 --> 00:19:25,715
of seconds maybe--

306
00:19:25,715 --> 00:19:26,673
- No it's very important.

307
00:19:26,673 --> 00:19:27,897
I mean extremely important.

308
00:19:27,897 --> 00:19:29,883
Unbelievably important.

309
00:19:29,883 --> 00:19:30,947
- Who are you exactly?

310
00:19:30,947 --> 00:19:32,277
Do you work here?

311
00:19:32,277 --> 00:19:33,681
- No I don't I saw you on TV

312
00:19:33,681 --> 00:19:35,710
so I came down here to find you.

313
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,553
- I don't think you're
supposed to be back here.

314
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:39,469
- No I'm not.

315
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,827
I know that but I need to talk to you.

316
00:19:41,827 --> 00:19:44,026
Look this is not easy for me,

317
00:19:44,026 --> 00:19:45,449
I don't know how to say this.

318
00:19:45,449 --> 00:19:46,763
- Are you a mail man?

319
00:19:46,763 --> 00:19:47,670
- No, I'm not a mail man,

320
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,816
i'm a postal employee

321
00:19:48,816 --> 00:19:50,490
there's a difference.

322
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,407
- Oh right.

323
00:19:54,614 --> 00:19:56,082
- No, no, no it's very urgent.

324
00:19:56,082 --> 00:19:57,625
You need to listen to me right now.

325
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:58,708
- Oh my god,

326
00:19:58,708 --> 00:19:59,541
if you touch me I will scream.

327
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:00,417
- I'm not going to touch you.

328
00:20:00,417 --> 00:20:01,363
I don't want to touch you,

329
00:20:01,363 --> 00:20:02,244
I just want to talk to you.

330
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:03,897
Listen I know what I'm about
to say is going to sound crazy,

331
00:20:03,897 --> 00:20:05,061
but I'm not crazy,

332
00:20:05,061 --> 00:20:05,955
really I'm not.

333
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,470
You've got to listen to me.

334
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,883
I was contacted by an alien

335
00:20:08,883 --> 00:20:10,679
a while ago,

336
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:12,816
actually she looked like
a tiny little mall tramp,

337
00:20:12,816 --> 00:20:14,410
but she said that was
just a mental projection.

338
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,240
She told me that I'm the
one who's been chosen

339
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,811
to defeat Zarkorr.

340
00:20:18,811 --> 00:20:19,708
- Zarkorr.

341
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:20,580
- Zarkorr right,

342
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,713
that's the name of the monster, Zarkorr.

343
00:20:22,713 --> 00:20:24,519
And I'm the one that's
been chosen to defeat him.

344
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:25,415
- Oh my god.

345
00:20:25,415 --> 00:20:26,325
- But I don't know how.

346
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,726
So I came down here to find you.

347
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,974
Listen can't we go somewhere and talk

348
00:20:29,974 --> 00:20:30,907
please.

349
00:20:30,907 --> 00:20:31,752
- Help.

350
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:32,833
- Security to stage eight.

351
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:33,666
- [Dr Martin] Help me.

352
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:34,499
- [Tommy] Please don't scream.

353
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:35,572
- There's a crazy post man over here.

354
00:20:35,572 --> 00:20:36,414
- What's the deal here,

355
00:20:36,414 --> 00:20:37,259
what's happening.

356
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:38,342
Oh are we on?

357
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,573
(screams)

358
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:45,012
- What the hell's going on there?

359
00:20:45,012 --> 00:20:47,878
- We've got a problem down here.

360
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:49,905
Can someone tell me what's happening?

361
00:20:49,905 --> 00:20:50,738
Please.

362
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:52,659
- Oh Christ.

363
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:54,896
- Over here,

364
00:20:54,896 --> 00:20:56,063
down that way.

365
00:20:58,377 --> 00:21:00,219
- Just stay away from me.

366
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:02,469
I just want to talk to her.

367
00:21:05,505 --> 00:21:07,838
- Okay everybody back off.

368
00:21:07,838 --> 00:21:10,862
- He's crazy, would
you get me out of here.

369
00:21:10,862 --> 00:21:12,839
- Okay back off everyone.

370
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:13,690
Clear a way.

371
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,514
Go on back off out of the way.

372
00:21:15,514 --> 00:21:17,539
- This isn't turning out like I expected.

373
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:21,617
- Okay mister we don't
want anyone to get hurt.

374
00:21:21,617 --> 00:21:23,303
- Listen I know this is hard to explain,

375
00:21:23,303 --> 00:21:24,564
but you just can't take me to jail

376
00:21:24,564 --> 00:21:26,381
it's impossible.

377
00:21:26,381 --> 00:21:29,246
- Oh we won't take you to jail.

378
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,814
- Yeah right we're only authorized

379
00:21:30,814 --> 00:21:33,814
to escort you off the property.

380
00:21:33,814 --> 00:21:35,924
So why don't you put down the C stand

381
00:21:35,924 --> 00:21:38,235
and just go on about your business.

382
00:21:38,235 --> 00:21:40,543
- Look I'm not crazy and
I'm not stupid either.

383
00:21:40,543 --> 00:21:41,376
- Okay I believe you,

384
00:21:41,376 --> 00:21:42,375
you're not stupid.

385
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:46,228
In that case I believe
you know what this is.

386
00:21:46,228 --> 00:21:48,139
This is a gun.

387
00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:49,610
Put down the C stand

388
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,878
or I will take this gun and shoot you

389
00:21:51,878 --> 00:21:53,711
and then you will die.

390
00:21:55,035 --> 00:21:56,478
- Shoot him.

391
00:21:56,478 --> 00:21:57,311
Just shoot him,

392
00:21:57,311 --> 00:21:58,166
just shoot him.

393
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,481
- Please excuse me lady I've got the

394
00:21:59,481 --> 00:22:01,335
situation under control here.

395
00:22:01,335 --> 00:22:04,287
(gasping)

396
00:22:04,287 --> 00:22:07,037
Okay fella what's it going to be?

397
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,547
- See, there you go.

398
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:15,605
No problem.

399
00:22:15,605 --> 00:22:16,837
Okay everybody.

400
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:17,670
- Drop it.

401
00:22:18,595 --> 00:22:19,678
Drop the gun,

402
00:22:20,623 --> 00:22:23,075
drop it and then back away.

403
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,216
- Don't do it,

404
00:22:24,216 --> 00:22:25,264
look it's all my fault.

405
00:22:25,264 --> 00:22:26,847
Joe just shoot him.

406
00:22:27,702 --> 00:22:29,043
Shoot through my body.

407
00:22:29,043 --> 00:22:30,350
- Don't try it,

408
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,910
you get back in the corner.

409
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,926
(ominous music)

410
00:22:34,926 --> 00:22:36,458
- What is going on here?

411
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:37,799
- Just get out of here.

412
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:40,648
- Right the police are out front.

413
00:22:40,648 --> 00:22:42,493
- Did you hear that mister?

414
00:22:42,493 --> 00:22:43,546
The police are here,

415
00:22:43,546 --> 00:22:44,932
what are you going to do now?

416
00:22:44,932 --> 00:22:46,589
- You listen to me drop
the gun on the floor

417
00:22:46,589 --> 00:22:47,579
and kick it over here.

418
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:48,412
Right now.

419
00:22:49,463 --> 00:22:52,671
- You're doing something really stupid.

420
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:53,887
- You do something smart
and give me that gun

421
00:22:53,887 --> 00:22:55,788
or I'll start shooting.

422
00:22:55,788 --> 00:22:57,866
I'm not kidding.

423
00:22:57,866 --> 00:22:58,699
- Okay.

424
00:23:00,141 --> 00:23:01,308
- Don't do it.

425
00:23:07,477 --> 00:23:08,310
- Get up.

426
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,584
Back off.

427
00:23:09,584 --> 00:23:11,142
Come on.

428
00:23:11,142 --> 00:23:12,832
I need you to help me.

429
00:23:12,832 --> 00:23:17,061
I won't hurt you, but I'm
not leaving here without you.

430
00:23:17,061 --> 00:23:17,894
Back off.

431
00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:20,095
Come on walk.

432
00:23:20,095 --> 00:23:20,946
Walk.

433
00:23:20,946 --> 00:23:22,260
You're going to be all right.

434
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,343
I'm not going to hurt you, I promise.

435
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,843
Back off.

436
00:23:27,843 --> 00:23:30,176
(screaming)

437
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:38,340
- [Dr Martin] Let go of me.

438
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,340
- I'm sorry.

439
00:23:40,854 --> 00:23:41,687
Stop it.

440
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:42,520
Stop it.

441
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,445
Stop it you just need to talk to me.

442
00:23:44,445 --> 00:23:45,957
I just need your help.

443
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:46,790
Stop it.

444
00:23:51,674 --> 00:23:53,841
(panting)

445
00:24:06,677 --> 00:24:08,260
This is a disaster.

446
00:24:09,743 --> 00:24:12,450
What the hell am I supposed to do now?

447
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:16,994
- Just stay calm everything
is going to be okay.

448
00:24:16,994 --> 00:24:18,777
- Everything's going to be okay?

449
00:24:18,777 --> 00:24:20,481
What are you nuts?

450
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:21,541
I told you that...

451
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:23,460
(police sirens)

452
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,293
Skip it, we're doomed.

453
00:24:27,356 --> 00:24:29,357
That's it I'm going to
end up in a nut house

454
00:24:29,357 --> 00:24:31,259
or in a jail somewhere
until Zarkorr comes along

455
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:35,426
and squashes me and then
destroys the whole world.

456
00:24:36,287 --> 00:24:39,456
- No, no, no I want the
building evacuated now.

457
00:24:39,456 --> 00:24:41,091
- Look all I'm asking for us

458
00:24:41,091 --> 00:24:43,589
is to keep one of our
guys with a minicam here,

459
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:45,155
I mean this is major news.

460
00:24:45,155 --> 00:24:48,070
- Excuse me, excuse me but does the

461
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,828
word no mean anything to you?

462
00:24:49,828 --> 00:24:50,671
- Look all I'm say--

463
00:24:50,671 --> 00:24:54,022
- Excuse me but does the word
now mean anything to you?

464
00:24:54,022 --> 00:24:58,145
- Okay, okay but this is
an abuse of authority.

465
00:24:58,145 --> 00:25:00,098
- Look I want this building emptied out

466
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,684
and I want it emptied out now.

467
00:25:02,684 --> 00:25:03,517
Thank you.

468
00:25:04,874 --> 00:25:07,796
(dramatic music)

469
00:25:07,796 --> 00:25:10,256
- This whole thing is my fault.

470
00:25:10,256 --> 00:25:13,224
Let me get in there and I'll tackle him.

471
00:25:13,224 --> 00:25:14,057
- No.

472
00:25:16,991 --> 00:25:20,658
- Hey you guys got a
swat team or something?

473
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,364
- Can you believe this?

474
00:25:23,364 --> 00:25:25,272
And all because you're
a reasonable person.

475
00:25:25,272 --> 00:25:28,122
And this whole thing
is totally ridiculous.

476
00:25:28,122 --> 00:25:30,707
I'm going to save the world.

477
00:25:30,707 --> 00:25:32,201
What a joke.

478
00:25:32,201 --> 00:25:35,036
- No, no, no, I believe you.

479
00:25:35,036 --> 00:25:39,203
I mean why shouldn't you be
the one to save the world?

480
00:25:41,233 --> 00:25:43,229
- You had your chance.

481
00:25:43,229 --> 00:25:45,072
If you're going to patronize
me at least do a better

482
00:25:45,072 --> 00:25:45,905
job of it.

483
00:25:50,284 --> 00:25:51,117
- All right don't you guys want to wait

484
00:25:51,117 --> 00:25:51,956
for some backup units?

485
00:25:51,956 --> 00:25:56,123
- Excuse me, but was that
advice you were offering me?

486
00:25:57,675 --> 00:25:58,544
- Sorry.

487
00:25:58,544 --> 00:25:59,983
- Look you planning on taking over

488
00:25:59,983 --> 00:26:01,476
or planing this operation?

489
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,368
- No, no I wasn't planning that.

490
00:26:03,368 --> 00:26:04,919
Sorry.

491
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:07,563
- You two guys get lost.

492
00:26:07,563 --> 00:26:09,744
Come on let's go check this guy out.

493
00:26:09,744 --> 00:26:12,494
(dramatic music)

494
00:26:13,879 --> 00:26:15,634
- Okay right look,

495
00:26:15,634 --> 00:26:17,919
the remote trucks are
being set up in the front.

496
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,181
- What about getting a camera in here?

497
00:26:20,181 --> 00:26:21,014
- Don't worry about it

498
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:23,077
our lawyers are taking
care of everything now.

499
00:26:23,077 --> 00:26:25,385
With any luck they'll
be doing this all day.

500
00:26:25,385 --> 00:26:26,426
- Oh please, please.

501
00:26:26,426 --> 00:26:27,426
Oh yes, yes.

502
00:26:29,145 --> 00:26:31,895
(dramatic music)

503
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:35,775
- [Voiceover] Police open up.

504
00:26:38,295 --> 00:26:39,128
- Go away.

505
00:26:39,994 --> 00:26:41,577
- Open up in there.

506
00:26:42,597 --> 00:26:44,031
- Don't try anything.

507
00:26:44,031 --> 00:26:46,614
I'm armed and I have a hostage.

508
00:26:47,681 --> 00:26:49,598
- He's a postal worker.

509
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:55,041
- Okay, look everything will be all right.

510
00:26:57,529 --> 00:26:59,112
- Another optimist.

511
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:04,081
Excuse me would you mind
coming over here a minute?

512
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:04,914
- Me, why?

513
00:27:06,467 --> 00:27:09,459
- Because I want to use
you as a human shield.

514
00:27:09,459 --> 00:27:12,068
And I'm armed and dangerous.

515
00:27:12,068 --> 00:27:13,985
Now do you mind please.

516
00:27:14,905 --> 00:27:15,738
Now.

517
00:27:26,429 --> 00:27:28,573
Now I want you to open up the door.

518
00:27:28,573 --> 00:27:29,855
Just a little bit,

519
00:27:29,855 --> 00:27:30,855
very slowly.

520
00:27:34,613 --> 00:27:35,780
That's enough.

521
00:27:36,678 --> 00:27:40,727
Okay guys listen up I
want you to back away.

522
00:27:40,727 --> 00:27:42,584
You're making me very nervous.

523
00:27:42,584 --> 00:27:43,984
- I'm backing up.

524
00:27:43,984 --> 00:27:45,734
Okay, now how's that?

525
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:49,396
- A little bit further.

526
00:27:49,396 --> 00:27:50,229
Please.

527
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,513
- There, now can we talk?

528
00:27:58,412 --> 00:28:00,412
- Guys, yeah I guess so.

529
00:28:02,241 --> 00:28:04,241
- So what's the problem?

530
00:28:06,572 --> 00:28:09,417
- Guys I know how bad this looks,

531
00:28:09,417 --> 00:28:11,599
but I'm not crazy.

532
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:12,883
I don't have any grudges,

533
00:28:12,883 --> 00:28:14,476
I don't want to hurt anybody.

534
00:28:14,476 --> 00:28:16,924
I'm just an average guy.

535
00:28:16,924 --> 00:28:20,258
But something happened to me this evening.

536
00:28:20,258 --> 00:28:21,463
I can't prove it,

537
00:28:21,463 --> 00:28:22,463
I know that.

538
00:28:23,386 --> 00:28:26,443
But you gotta listen to me please.

539
00:28:26,443 --> 00:28:27,459
This monster,

540
00:28:27,459 --> 00:28:28,885
this thing that appeared in California

541
00:28:28,885 --> 00:28:32,131
is not a dinosaur or a
mutation or anything like that.

542
00:28:32,131 --> 00:28:34,683
It's from outer space.

543
00:28:34,683 --> 00:28:35,988
It's a kind of test.

544
00:28:35,988 --> 00:28:38,724
It's a test of the human race.

545
00:28:38,724 --> 00:28:40,281
No army can stop it.

546
00:28:40,281 --> 00:28:42,849
No weapons, no H bombs, nothing.

547
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:45,366
I know, I've been told.

548
00:28:45,366 --> 00:28:46,533
I was visited.

549
00:28:48,438 --> 00:28:51,203
An alien being appeared
to me this evening.

550
00:28:51,203 --> 00:28:52,473
At first I didn't believe it

551
00:28:52,473 --> 00:28:55,418
but she told me about the
monster before I saw it on TV.

552
00:28:55,418 --> 00:28:58,508
So I knew it had to be real.

553
00:28:58,508 --> 00:29:02,675
And she told me that I've
been chosen to defeat Zarkorr.

554
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:08,127
That's the name of the monster.

555
00:29:08,127 --> 00:29:09,446
And she told me that I'm the only one

556
00:29:09,446 --> 00:29:10,279
who can do it.

557
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:14,089
So if you lock me up that
would be the end of everything.

558
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:16,604
This monster will home
in on me and kill me.

559
00:29:16,604 --> 00:29:19,957
And then destroy all human civilization.

560
00:29:19,957 --> 00:29:21,957
- Why is it exactly that

561
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,480
this alien picked you to defeat Zerkonian.

562
00:29:27,597 --> 00:29:28,430
- Zarkorr.

563
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,872
Because I'm the median human,

564
00:29:31,872 --> 00:29:33,289
I'm dead average.

565
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,630
Look I know how totally
unsuited I am for this job.

566
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,330
I mean I've only been
at it an hour and a half

567
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:41,361
and I'm already about to be shot.

568
00:29:41,361 --> 00:29:43,236
Or locked up in a nut house or jail

569
00:29:43,236 --> 00:29:46,403
but I didn't say I was any good at it.

570
00:29:48,234 --> 00:29:50,583
But I'm the one they picked.

571
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:51,833
Please, please.

572
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:56,897
- Larry I believe him.

573
00:29:56,897 --> 00:29:58,720
- Yeah right.

574
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,485
Yeah I believe him too.

575
00:30:00,485 --> 00:30:02,918
- No, no you don't understand
I'm not trying to fool him

576
00:30:02,918 --> 00:30:04,750
I really do believe him.

577
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,583
- What?

578
00:30:06,567 --> 00:30:09,764
- Don't you know what's been going on?

579
00:30:09,764 --> 00:30:10,681
With UFO's.

580
00:30:11,526 --> 00:30:13,959
They've been watching us for centuries.

581
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:15,422
I mean look at the evidence.

582
00:30:15,422 --> 00:30:17,342
Abductions, cattle mutilations.

583
00:30:17,342 --> 00:30:18,571
They're all around us.

584
00:30:18,571 --> 00:30:19,626
- George.

585
00:30:19,626 --> 00:30:21,528
- I mean you have to look at the evidence.

586
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,372
And if an alien civilization
can cross trillions

587
00:30:23,372 --> 00:30:27,295
of miles of space who says
they can't create a monster.

588
00:30:27,295 --> 00:30:28,721
- George just calm--

589
00:30:28,721 --> 00:30:30,203
- I mean what other explanation is there?

590
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,349
- George go to the patrol car now.

591
00:30:32,349 --> 00:30:33,952
- No Larry I'm serious.

592
00:30:33,952 --> 00:30:35,537
How else can you explain a
giant monster just appearing

593
00:30:35,537 --> 00:30:36,370
like this?

594
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:43,418
It makes sense that the other
civilizations in the galaxy

595
00:30:44,283 --> 00:30:45,950
would be testing us.

596
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,647
What if he's telling the truth?

597
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:54,172
If we lock him up it could
mean the end of civilization.

598
00:30:54,172 --> 00:30:56,609
- George can we talk about this later?

599
00:30:56,609 --> 00:30:59,192
- Larry you know I respect you.

600
00:31:00,556 --> 00:31:01,556
- Oh my god.

601
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:06,493
- But I'm afraid I'm going
to have to take your gun.

602
00:31:06,493 --> 00:31:09,488
- George have you gone
totally and completely

603
00:31:09,488 --> 00:31:11,785
and in every other way out of your mind?

604
00:31:11,785 --> 00:31:13,235
I'm not going to let you do this.

605
00:31:13,235 --> 00:31:16,445
- Larry I love you like an older brother

606
00:31:16,445 --> 00:31:18,722
but I've got to go with my gut.

607
00:31:18,722 --> 00:31:20,883
And if you don't give me that gun

608
00:31:20,883 --> 00:31:22,748
I'll be forced to shoot ya.

609
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:24,975
- George you're throwing away your career.

610
00:31:24,975 --> 00:31:28,589
- Dammit civilization is at stake.

611
00:31:28,589 --> 00:31:30,025
Okay I'm counting.

612
00:31:30,025 --> 00:31:30,866
Five--

613
00:31:30,866 --> 00:31:31,699
- Please let's talk about this George.

614
00:31:31,699 --> 00:31:33,002
- Four.

615
00:31:33,002 --> 00:31:34,081
Three.

616
00:31:34,081 --> 00:31:35,035
Two.

617
00:31:35,035 --> 00:31:36,785
- Okay, okay take it.

618
00:31:38,032 --> 00:31:39,865
- If I come out of this thing alive

619
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:41,825
so help me god I am going to sue

620
00:31:41,825 --> 00:31:46,222
the New Ark police department
and I will bankrupt you.

621
00:31:46,222 --> 00:31:47,869
- Lady that's really top
one on the list of my

622
00:31:47,869 --> 00:31:49,720
current problems right now.

623
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,416
- Larry get your hands up.

624
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:53,139
Assume the position against that wall.

625
00:31:53,139 --> 00:31:54,139
Now move it.

626
00:31:55,004 --> 00:31:56,421
- [Larry] George.

627
00:32:01,398 --> 00:32:02,635
- Look I'm sorry about this Larry

628
00:32:02,635 --> 00:32:04,717
but we're going to need
some get away time.

629
00:32:04,717 --> 00:32:06,840
(mumbling)

630
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,121
Larry cut it out.

631
00:32:08,121 --> 00:32:10,639
You're going to strain your throat.

632
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:12,481
Look we better get out of here.

633
00:32:12,481 --> 00:32:14,846
Backup should be coming any second.

634
00:32:14,846 --> 00:32:15,990
We taking her?

635
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,338
- Yes.

636
00:32:17,338 --> 00:32:18,276
- Right.

637
00:32:18,276 --> 00:32:19,793
- Well let's see if we can find a back way

638
00:32:19,793 --> 00:32:21,632
out of this place.

639
00:32:21,632 --> 00:32:23,134
Stay behind me.

640
00:32:23,134 --> 00:32:23,967
Anybody start shooting,

641
00:32:23,967 --> 00:32:25,520
get down.

642
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,049
- Okay.

643
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:28,472
Lets go.

644
00:32:28,472 --> 00:32:31,605
Don't scream or he'll shoot ya.

645
00:32:31,605 --> 00:32:33,458
- Where exactly are you taking me?

646
00:32:33,458 --> 00:32:34,436
- I don't know.

647
00:32:34,436 --> 00:32:37,240
I haven't figured that out yet.

648
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,509
(dramatic music)

649
00:32:39,509 --> 00:32:41,759
(mumbling)

650
00:32:42,892 --> 00:32:45,798
- [Dr Martins] Let go of me now.

651
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:48,572
I told you look there
is no way out of here.

652
00:32:48,572 --> 00:32:51,322
- Sorry lady that's my squad car.

653
00:32:55,681 --> 00:32:57,553
Put her in the back.

654
00:32:57,553 --> 00:32:58,854
- [Dr Martins] Let go.

655
00:32:58,854 --> 00:33:01,604
(dramatic music)

656
00:33:15,308 --> 00:33:18,641
(police sirens blaring)

657
00:33:20,848 --> 00:33:23,265
(screeching)

658
00:33:24,366 --> 00:33:26,783
(explosions)

659
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,370
(dramatic music)

660
00:33:45,827 --> 00:33:48,244
(screeching)

661
00:33:58,028 --> 00:33:59,345
- I'm sorry what's your name?

662
00:33:59,345 --> 00:34:00,178
- George.

663
00:34:00,178 --> 00:34:01,573
- George you got a radio or anything?

664
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:02,814
- Yeah here hold on.

665
00:34:02,814 --> 00:34:04,227
- We need to get some news on this thing.

666
00:34:04,227 --> 00:34:06,985
- Yeah it's right down there.

667
00:34:06,985 --> 00:34:09,637
- Be careful with that it's Larry's.

668
00:34:09,637 --> 00:34:10,470
- I will.

669
00:34:16,466 --> 00:34:17,787
- [Voiceover] And all national guard units

670
00:34:17,787 --> 00:34:19,031
have been completely wiped out.

671
00:34:19,031 --> 00:34:21,557
Reports indicate the Aurora
monster has proven invulnerable

672
00:34:21,557 --> 00:34:23,136
to attacks by bazooka teams,

673
00:34:23,136 --> 00:34:25,748
stinger missiles and heavy artillery.

674
00:34:25,748 --> 00:34:27,844
Hold on we're going remote.

675
00:34:27,844 --> 00:34:29,281
- [Voiceover] Hello this is Loyd Ink,

676
00:34:29,281 --> 00:34:31,391
I'm stationed with the
national guard command post

677
00:34:31,391 --> 00:34:32,978
on the side of Mount Tiko

678
00:34:32,978 --> 00:34:34,873
we can the monster
around a mile away moving

679
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:37,588
up the valley due east directly toward us.

680
00:34:37,588 --> 00:34:40,315
As we've reported before the
president has given special

681
00:34:40,315 --> 00:34:42,872
authorization for air force
bombers to undertake an assault

682
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:45,114
against the monster with Napalm bombs.

683
00:34:45,114 --> 00:34:47,981
We can hear the aircraft moving in now.

684
00:34:47,981 --> 00:34:49,536
Hold on, there they go.

685
00:34:49,536 --> 00:34:51,253
The valley is exploding in fire.

686
00:34:51,253 --> 00:34:53,806
God what a sight huge
balls of fire exploding

687
00:34:53,806 --> 00:34:55,007
one after the other.

688
00:34:55,007 --> 00:34:57,058
We can see the monster burning
in the middle of the flames.

689
00:34:57,058 --> 00:34:59,025
The whole forest is on fire all around it.

690
00:34:59,025 --> 00:35:01,249
I can't quite see anything
through the smoke right now

691
00:35:01,249 --> 00:35:02,890
I think the monster's gone down.

692
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,821
Jesus Christ no he's still coming

693
00:35:04,821 --> 00:35:06,671
it hasn't even been touched.

694
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:08,874
It's shooting lightning
bolts from its eyes.

695
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:12,254
The planes are being blown
from the skies one by one.

696
00:35:12,254 --> 00:35:15,004
(dramatic music)

697
00:35:17,389 --> 00:35:18,889
- Can we talk now?

698
00:35:20,894 --> 00:35:23,117
- This isn't possible.

699
00:35:23,117 --> 00:35:27,418
Nothing on earth could
survive something like that.

700
00:35:27,418 --> 00:35:29,999
- Look even if you don't
believe me you're here,

701
00:35:29,999 --> 00:35:31,082
you're stuck.

702
00:35:32,742 --> 00:35:36,673
Let's just pretend that
I'm telling the truth,

703
00:35:36,673 --> 00:35:39,176
now this alien told me certain things,

704
00:35:39,176 --> 00:35:40,009
hold on,

705
00:35:41,149 --> 00:35:43,889
let's assume for the sake of a argument

706
00:35:43,889 --> 00:35:46,820
that all this is true, okay.

707
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,653
Okay?

708
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:50,306
- Fine.

709
00:35:50,306 --> 00:35:52,033
- Now this is what she said.

710
00:35:52,033 --> 00:35:53,696
She said Zarkorr can't be defeated by

711
00:35:53,696 --> 00:35:55,700
any earthly weapon currently being used

712
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,799
or under development by
any armed force on earth.

713
00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:01,625
That includes nuclear weapons,

714
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:04,042
chemical weapons, everything.

715
00:36:07,953 --> 00:36:10,802
Look the way I see it is this,

716
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:13,785
this whole thing is layed out

717
00:36:13,785 --> 00:36:17,218
so that I'm the only one who
can figure this thing out

718
00:36:17,218 --> 00:36:19,158
and if it's not me,

719
00:36:19,158 --> 00:36:21,226
then it's nobody.

720
00:36:21,226 --> 00:36:22,596
Does that make sense?

721
00:36:22,596 --> 00:36:25,753
- Makes perfect sense to me.

722
00:36:25,753 --> 00:36:27,336
- Yeah okay me too.

723
00:36:29,932 --> 00:36:32,514
- I don't know what the
hell I'm supposed to do.

724
00:36:32,514 --> 00:36:36,076
The thing is the alien said
that it can be destroyed

725
00:36:36,076 --> 00:36:37,880
and there is a way for me to find out how.

726
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,484
But I just have to figure it out

727
00:36:40,484 --> 00:36:41,716
and that's why I came to get you,

728
00:36:41,716 --> 00:36:42,716
to find you.

729
00:36:43,637 --> 00:36:45,568
I need more information.

730
00:36:45,568 --> 00:36:48,735
I need to find out more about Zarkorr.

731
00:36:50,812 --> 00:36:52,431
I need your help.

732
00:36:52,431 --> 00:36:53,264
Please.

733
00:36:54,797 --> 00:36:57,380
I can't force you to cooperate.

734
00:36:58,317 --> 00:36:59,955
- Could probably force her.

735
00:36:59,955 --> 00:37:03,038
- No please, just think for a minute,

736
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:06,849
you said it yourself
it's not from this earth.

737
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:09,168
Now if this monster came from outer space

738
00:37:09,168 --> 00:37:11,098
and that much is true,

739
00:37:11,098 --> 00:37:13,244
then why not the rest?

740
00:37:13,244 --> 00:37:15,376
- He convinced me.

741
00:37:15,376 --> 00:37:17,990
- Oh god I got to think.

742
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:18,950
- [Voiceover] Any unit in the vicinity

743
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:21,540
we have a 417 in progress
one officer held hostage.

744
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,228
- Yeah we may have to think on foot,

745
00:37:23,228 --> 00:37:25,184
they just found Larry
they're looking for us.

746
00:37:25,184 --> 00:37:27,529
- What do we do now?

747
00:37:27,529 --> 00:37:30,118
- Well we're going to
have to take a chance

748
00:37:30,118 --> 00:37:31,881
that we don't get spotted for
another five minutes or so.

749
00:37:31,881 --> 00:37:34,894
Now I can hide the squad
car where it won't be found

750
00:37:34,894 --> 00:37:38,442
but after that we're
pretty much on our own.

751
00:37:38,442 --> 00:37:40,325
I mean I don't have any other wheels handy

752
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:43,075
we're just gonna have to hoof it.

753
00:37:45,798 --> 00:37:46,887
- Okay,

754
00:37:46,887 --> 00:37:48,259
(dramatic music)

755
00:37:48,259 --> 00:37:49,569
let's do it.

756
00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:52,319
(dramatic music)

757
00:38:39,477 --> 00:38:41,511
- Why do I get the feeling
that the rest of my life

758
00:38:41,511 --> 00:38:44,011
is going to be just like this?

759
00:38:45,621 --> 00:38:47,330
- Where can we go?

760
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:50,394
- Well I can think of three
places where we can't go.

761
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:53,311
Your place, my place and her place.

762
00:38:54,896 --> 00:38:57,011
Any other ideas.

763
00:38:57,011 --> 00:38:58,689
- Not that I can think of.

764
00:38:58,689 --> 00:38:59,688
You're the expert.

765
00:38:59,688 --> 00:39:01,489
- Uh huh, you are.

766
00:39:01,489 --> 00:39:05,975
Where we go kind of depends
on what you wanna do.

767
00:39:05,975 --> 00:39:06,808
- God.

768
00:39:08,271 --> 00:39:10,438
- Look you've been chosen,

769
00:39:12,037 --> 00:39:14,941
read the bible Moses
didn't like it either.

770
00:39:14,941 --> 00:39:15,941
That's life.

771
00:39:17,809 --> 00:39:19,634
- She said that Zarkorr contained the key

772
00:39:19,634 --> 00:39:21,894
to his own destruction.

773
00:39:21,894 --> 00:39:23,908
That was a hint.

774
00:39:23,908 --> 00:39:25,703
- No it's a tautology.

775
00:39:25,703 --> 00:39:28,244
Okay everything contains the
key to it's own destruction.

776
00:39:28,244 --> 00:39:29,819
- [Tommy] She said it was a hint.

777
00:39:29,819 --> 00:39:32,319
- What the hell's a tautology?

778
00:39:33,835 --> 00:39:36,181
- It can't be just that she
made a big point out of it.

779
00:39:36,181 --> 00:39:40,348
She said Zarkorr contains the
key to his own destruction.

780
00:39:41,594 --> 00:39:44,860
And whatever that key is it's
something that the government

781
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,966
can't find and the military
isn't going to find,

782
00:39:46,966 --> 00:39:48,549
only I can find it.

783
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:53,838
But what the hell could it be?

784
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:56,588
(dramatic music)

785
00:40:02,468 --> 00:40:03,301
Look,

786
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,697
look I need your help.

787
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:14,090
And if I can't have it
then there's no point in me

788
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:16,774
dragging you around with me.

789
00:40:16,774 --> 00:40:19,879
Either way I'm not going to hurt you.

790
00:40:19,879 --> 00:40:21,379
I'm not dangerous.

791
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:24,550
And I'm not crazy either.

792
00:40:30,867 --> 00:40:32,876
You tell me if Zarkorr
didn't come from outer space

793
00:40:32,876 --> 00:40:35,959
then where the hell did he come from?

794
00:40:39,053 --> 00:40:40,303
- I don't know.

795
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:44,938
No it is not from earth, it can't be.

796
00:40:44,938 --> 00:40:46,228
It's totally ridiculous,

797
00:40:46,228 --> 00:40:47,561
but it can't be.

798
00:40:51,181 --> 00:40:52,264
You're right.

799
00:40:54,496 --> 00:40:56,513
- I don't know if you can help me,

800
00:40:56,513 --> 00:40:59,693
but right now you're all I've got.

801
00:40:59,693 --> 00:41:02,328
- What am I supposed to do?

802
00:41:02,328 --> 00:41:07,241
There is no such thing as
an expert in alien life.

803
00:41:07,241 --> 00:41:10,074
- Are you going to help me or not?

804
00:41:12,959 --> 00:41:15,709
- Okay, I know a place we can go.

805
00:41:20,443 --> 00:41:21,276
Here.

806
00:41:29,818 --> 00:41:30,690
- Maybe I am crazy,

807
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,626
everyone seems to be
acting as if I'm crazy.

808
00:41:32,626 --> 00:41:34,139
It doesn't make much sense,

809
00:41:34,139 --> 00:41:35,428
I mean why'd they pick me?

810
00:41:35,428 --> 00:41:38,607
I don't know she said it's
because I'm the average guy

811
00:41:38,607 --> 00:41:40,440
but that sounds crazy.

812
00:41:42,695 --> 00:41:44,747
Then this little thing she just vanished

813
00:41:44,747 --> 00:41:47,000
and I had no idea what to do next

814
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,220
but she left me a list of
stuff that I was supposed

815
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,711
to keep in mind.

816
00:41:50,711 --> 00:41:52,153
And then I saw Stephanie on TV

817
00:41:52,153 --> 00:41:54,021
so I went down to the
station to try to talk to her

818
00:41:54,021 --> 00:41:55,649
because she's an expert

819
00:41:55,649 --> 00:41:59,767
but she wouldn't believe
me so I had to force her

820
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,149
to believe me and then
George finally did believe me

821
00:42:02,149 --> 00:42:03,725
but the police are looking for us.

822
00:42:03,725 --> 00:42:06,448
And we had to hide the patrol car

823
00:42:06,448 --> 00:42:07,450
so they wouldn't find us.

824
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:08,289
And we took a bus--

825
00:42:08,289 --> 00:42:09,897
- Hey man this isn't funny.

826
00:42:09,897 --> 00:42:11,323
- Noway don't pay attention to him okay,

827
00:42:11,323 --> 00:42:12,853
it's a nervous habit

828
00:42:12,853 --> 00:42:15,103
(laughing)

829
00:42:17,937 --> 00:42:20,356
- So you want me to help you destroy this,

830
00:42:20,356 --> 00:42:21,439
this Zarkorr?

831
00:42:26,546 --> 00:42:28,004
- [George] Christ let's get out of here.

832
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:29,345
- No, no, no, no.

833
00:42:29,345 --> 00:42:30,616
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

834
00:42:30,616 --> 00:42:32,029
It's cool, it's cool, it's cool.

835
00:42:32,029 --> 00:42:33,112
It's surreal.

836
00:42:35,922 --> 00:42:37,746
It's cosmic.

837
00:42:37,746 --> 00:42:38,579
I like it.

838
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:40,741
I like it, oh yeah.

839
00:42:40,741 --> 00:42:42,491
It's cool, it's cool.

840
00:42:45,598 --> 00:42:48,472
- So can you get us the
information we need?

841
00:42:48,472 --> 00:42:51,349
- Arthur can get anything he's a hacker.

842
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:52,336
Actually he'd be in jail right now

843
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:54,321
if he hadn't erased
his own indictment file

844
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:55,764
from the DA's database.

845
00:42:55,764 --> 00:42:58,522
- Excuse me Stephanie not hacker.

846
00:42:58,522 --> 00:43:00,748
Hacker is a demeaning term,

847
00:43:00,748 --> 00:43:03,196
I prefer cyber-naught.

848
00:43:03,196 --> 00:43:04,105
- Cyber naught.

849
00:43:04,105 --> 00:43:07,042
- As in a sailor through cyber space.

850
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,661
Okay hold on now.

851
00:43:08,661 --> 00:43:09,494
Hold on.

852
00:43:09,494 --> 00:43:10,327
Okay.

853
00:43:10,327 --> 00:43:11,204
Okay.

854
00:43:11,204 --> 00:43:12,156
I'm writing a little program here

855
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:14,220
which is going to search for
any references to Zarkorr

856
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,324
on the net.

857
00:43:15,324 --> 00:43:17,835
However we have to limit
ourselves a little bit

858
00:43:17,835 --> 00:43:19,251
because we don't care what any ordinary

859
00:43:19,251 --> 00:43:20,988
schmucks have to say,

860
00:43:20,988 --> 00:43:21,821
do we?

861
00:43:21,821 --> 00:43:22,662
No, no, no, no, no, no.

862
00:43:22,662 --> 00:43:26,245
We're looking for labs,
military data coms,

863
00:43:27,157 --> 00:43:30,240
pentagon feeds, university chit chat.

864
00:43:35,028 --> 00:43:38,898
Here let's try a little bit
of encrypted satellite info,

865
00:43:38,898 --> 00:43:41,815
that usually turns you the goodies.

866
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:45,473
So are you two going out?

867
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:51,820
Are you two?

868
00:43:56,874 --> 00:43:58,457
What about you two?

869
00:43:59,409 --> 00:44:03,299
Any combinations of (mumbles)?

870
00:44:03,299 --> 00:44:04,132
No, oh.

871
00:44:06,221 --> 00:44:09,221
So you work for the post office huh.

872
00:44:10,667 --> 00:44:11,816
- Yeah.

873
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:13,058
- Cool.

874
00:44:13,058 --> 00:44:14,175
Cool.

875
00:44:14,175 --> 00:44:16,425
(laughing)

876
00:44:17,928 --> 00:44:19,770
Okay we've got to let this
baby compile a little bit

877
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:22,591
and see what she comes up with.

878
00:44:22,591 --> 00:44:24,073
So you got a girlfriend?

879
00:44:24,073 --> 00:44:25,634
- No not really.

880
00:44:25,634 --> 00:44:26,634
- Oh so you,

881
00:44:27,694 --> 00:44:29,922
you go to prostitutes huh?

882
00:44:29,922 --> 00:44:30,755
- No.

883
00:44:31,662 --> 00:44:33,245
- I'll bet he does.

884
00:44:34,869 --> 00:44:36,821
- I see what you mean about social skills.

885
00:44:36,821 --> 00:44:38,933
- It only gets worse.

886
00:44:38,933 --> 00:44:41,651
- Stephanie here lost
here virginity to her

887
00:44:41,651 --> 00:44:43,366
literature professor.

888
00:44:43,366 --> 00:44:44,984
Barnard.

889
00:44:44,984 --> 00:44:48,739
When I was a kid I tapped
her home phone line

890
00:44:48,739 --> 00:44:51,748
and she called him up,
they talked all about it.

891
00:44:51,748 --> 00:44:52,581
- Shut up.

892
00:44:53,574 --> 00:44:55,552
- You wanna listen to the tape?

893
00:44:55,552 --> 00:44:56,969
- Arthur shut up.

894
00:44:58,785 --> 00:45:00,864
- How long's it going to
take for the data to come up?

895
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,398
- It'll take awhile.

896
00:45:02,398 --> 00:45:03,409
Yeah, yeah.

897
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:04,405
It'll take awhile.

898
00:45:04,405 --> 00:45:05,629
It'll take awhile, but it's cool,

899
00:45:05,629 --> 00:45:07,060
it's okay, you guys

900
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:08,988
you guys could hide out here.

901
00:45:08,988 --> 00:45:10,655
I could order lunch.

902
00:45:11,634 --> 00:45:12,922
But I'm not going to pay for yours.

903
00:45:12,922 --> 00:45:16,211
You got to pay for it yourself.

904
00:45:16,211 --> 00:45:18,378
Anybody feel like Mexican?

905
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:23,255
I live off of the disability and interest

906
00:45:23,255 --> 00:45:26,166
that I got from this
money I won in a law suit

907
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:29,582
from this kid, this kid from (mumbles)

908
00:45:29,582 --> 00:45:32,646
he hit me with his motor scooter,

909
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:33,896
he crippled me.

910
00:45:34,895 --> 00:45:36,645
Crippled me for life.

911
00:45:37,843 --> 00:45:39,676
But he was a rich kid.

912
00:45:41,456 --> 00:45:43,873
Lucky me, lucky me, lucky me.

913
00:45:47,997 --> 00:45:49,594
- [Voiceover] (mumbles) to
the federal court on behalf

914
00:45:49,594 --> 00:45:51,703
of the United Environmental defense fund

915
00:45:51,703 --> 00:45:53,957
to seek an injunction to
prevent further aggressive

916
00:45:53,957 --> 00:45:56,305
against the Aurora monster.

917
00:45:56,305 --> 00:45:58,598
- That's right all the
evidence we have indicates

918
00:45:58,598 --> 00:45:59,628
that this animal,

919
00:45:59,628 --> 00:46:01,206
and we don't like to call it a monster,

920
00:46:01,206 --> 00:46:02,946
is completely unique.

921
00:46:02,946 --> 00:46:04,801
It's one of a kind and it's our position

922
00:46:04,801 --> 00:46:06,399
that it falls under the protection

923
00:46:06,399 --> 00:46:07,831
of the endangered species act.

924
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:09,768
- But Mr Bergman this animal has caused

925
00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:11,652
hundreds of fatalities and caused millions

926
00:46:11,652 --> 00:46:13,585
of dollars of property damage.

927
00:46:13,585 --> 00:46:15,572
- That is not relevant to
the (mumbles) in question

928
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:17,612
they do not distinguish
between dangerous animals

929
00:46:17,612 --> 00:46:18,801
and benign ones.

930
00:46:18,801 --> 00:46:20,161
And let me jut add one more thing

931
00:46:20,161 --> 00:46:22,070
that the actions already
taken against this animal

932
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,921
including the use of napalm
in the Mount Tiko Valley,

933
00:46:24,921 --> 00:46:27,584
which is just unbelievable.

934
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:30,171
But not only my guess have
already fatally injured

935
00:46:30,171 --> 00:46:32,218
the Aurora animal but it
most certainly will have

936
00:46:32,218 --> 00:46:34,073
profound negative consequences
for the red tipped

937
00:46:34,073 --> 00:46:38,008
dwarf owl which lives only in that region.

938
00:46:38,008 --> 00:46:39,091
- Is that so.

939
00:46:41,189 --> 00:46:42,824
- Okay, okay, here I come.

940
00:46:42,824 --> 00:46:44,771
Here I come get ready.

941
00:46:44,771 --> 00:46:45,920
Okay, okay okay

942
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,968
these are the first stacks of hard copy,

943
00:46:49,968 --> 00:46:51,713
there's more on the way a lot more.

944
00:46:51,713 --> 00:46:53,318
More on the way.

945
00:46:53,318 --> 00:46:56,068
(dramatic music)

946
00:46:56,976 --> 00:46:59,357
- Okay let's start saving the world.

947
00:46:59,357 --> 00:47:02,107
(dramatic music)

948
00:47:08,227 --> 00:47:10,644
(screeching)

949
00:47:22,332 --> 00:47:24,749
(explosions)

950
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,860
- Energy, energy that's all it really is.

951
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:00,028
- [Voiceover] Laser light
doesn't leave footprints.

952
00:48:00,028 --> 00:48:02,015
- Well you see that's the problem.

953
00:48:02,015 --> 00:48:04,310
If this technology's so
far advanced of ours then

954
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:07,674
it's impossible to say what it could do.

955
00:48:07,674 --> 00:48:09,959
This thing doesn't eat,

956
00:48:09,959 --> 00:48:11,438
it doesn't bleed,

957
00:48:11,438 --> 00:48:13,483
it doesn't breathe.

958
00:48:13,483 --> 00:48:16,364
It can't be hurt by any
kind of material defense

959
00:48:16,364 --> 00:48:19,364
so how do you shoot a beam of light?

960
00:48:20,513 --> 00:48:21,596
- How do you?

961
00:48:22,904 --> 00:48:25,279
- You hit the off switch.

962
00:48:25,279 --> 00:48:28,029
- No, no, no no that makes sense.

963
00:48:29,116 --> 00:48:31,772
- Look there isn't going
to be any off switch okay,

964
00:48:31,772 --> 00:48:33,749
or whatever that means.

965
00:48:33,749 --> 00:48:35,141
If they could make this thing

966
00:48:35,141 --> 00:48:38,259
then they could certainly
make the switch inaccessible.

967
00:48:38,259 --> 00:48:39,447
- Of course that's the point.

968
00:48:39,447 --> 00:48:40,658
If they wanted to destroy the earth

969
00:48:40,658 --> 00:48:42,232
that's what they would have done.

970
00:48:42,232 --> 00:48:44,697
But they need to make the means
of destroying this monster

971
00:48:44,697 --> 00:48:46,469
accessible to me.

972
00:48:46,469 --> 00:48:48,074
- And not anybody else.

973
00:48:48,074 --> 00:48:50,053
- No no one else is going
to think of an off switch.

974
00:48:50,053 --> 00:48:51,907
They're not going to
bother to look for it.

975
00:48:51,907 --> 00:48:54,759
How can they know what we know?

976
00:48:54,759 --> 00:48:56,295
- But it could be anywhere.

977
00:48:56,295 --> 00:48:58,905
It could look like anything.

978
00:48:58,905 --> 00:49:03,155
- Look last night this monster
came out of that mountain

979
00:49:03,155 --> 00:49:06,403
and some time before that
it must have been turned on.

980
00:49:06,403 --> 00:49:09,755
Generated, brought to life, whatever.

981
00:49:09,755 --> 00:49:10,919
That's where we need to look,

982
00:49:10,919 --> 00:49:13,748
that's where the switch was flipped.

983
00:49:13,748 --> 00:49:16,323
We need to see what
happened in the mountain

984
00:49:16,323 --> 00:49:18,690
at the time that the monster appeared.

985
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:20,447
When they first turned it on.

986
00:49:20,447 --> 00:49:21,280
- Say no more,

987
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,151
say no more,

988
00:49:22,151 --> 00:49:22,984
say no more.

989
00:49:22,984 --> 00:49:23,817
I am on it.

990
00:49:23,817 --> 00:49:24,650
I am on it.

991
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:25,483
You want your weather data,

992
00:49:25,483 --> 00:49:26,770
you want your satellite photos.

993
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:28,638
You want your seismic reports.

994
00:49:28,638 --> 00:49:30,929
You want your radar anomalies.

995
00:49:30,929 --> 00:49:32,759
I got it, got it, got it.

996
00:49:32,759 --> 00:49:34,278
Warning, warning, warning.

997
00:49:34,278 --> 00:49:35,111
Come on get back.

998
00:49:35,111 --> 00:49:36,284
Get out of my way.

999
00:49:36,284 --> 00:49:37,746
Okay, okay.

1000
00:49:37,746 --> 00:49:41,413
This is cool okay we're
starting at eight pm

1001
00:49:43,899 --> 00:49:46,336
and we're wining our way
through the seismic data.

1002
00:49:46,336 --> 00:49:50,944
It will stop at the first
indication of seismic activity.

1003
00:49:50,944 --> 00:49:53,591
There it is at 8:18 pm.

1004
00:49:53,591 --> 00:49:54,508
You see it?

1005
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,963
It only gets progressively worse.

1006
00:49:58,963 --> 00:50:03,128
And there it is, there it
is at 10:03 pacific time.

1007
00:50:03,128 --> 00:50:04,439
- Go back to the beginning.

1008
00:50:04,439 --> 00:50:05,750
- Yeah what was that?

1009
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:06,750
That was it.

1010
00:50:07,903 --> 00:50:09,791
That's when it was turned on

1011
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:12,541
or implanted or whatever at 6:23.

1012
00:50:14,084 --> 00:50:16,644
It must have taken a few
hours for it to charge

1013
00:50:16,644 --> 00:50:19,986
or grow large enough to
appear again at 8:18.

1014
00:50:19,986 --> 00:50:21,042
- But what do we do with it?

1015
00:50:21,042 --> 00:50:22,971
- We have to look for
something else that happened

1016
00:50:22,971 --> 00:50:25,017
at the same time.

1017
00:50:25,017 --> 00:50:27,064
At the moment that spark
appeared in the mountains

1018
00:50:27,064 --> 00:50:29,164
something else must have happened.

1019
00:50:29,164 --> 00:50:30,594
If I'm right.

1020
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:31,427
- I'm checking,

1021
00:50:31,427 --> 00:50:32,604
I'm checking, checking, checking

1022
00:50:32,604 --> 00:50:34,719
clear the way, clear
the way, clear the way.

1023
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:36,386
Okay satellite data.

1024
00:50:37,899 --> 00:50:38,899
No, no 6:25.

1025
00:50:41,187 --> 00:50:43,743
High pressure center.

1026
00:50:43,743 --> 00:50:47,071
No no change, no change, nothing, nothing.

1027
00:50:47,071 --> 00:50:47,904
Wait.

1028
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:50,343
Military radar.

1029
00:50:50,343 --> 00:50:52,676
Top secret for my eyes only.

1030
00:50:55,258 --> 00:50:56,091
I'm just kidding.

1031
00:50:56,091 --> 00:50:56,933
Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait

1032
00:50:56,933 --> 00:50:59,100
I gotta break a few codes.

1033
00:51:01,092 --> 00:51:01,925
Um.

1034
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:02,758
- What?

1035
00:51:03,866 --> 00:51:06,805
- We're in violation of federal law.

1036
00:51:06,805 --> 00:51:08,303
- Big deal.

1037
00:51:08,303 --> 00:51:11,097
- Oh yeah, did you ever see
that movie with Linda Blair?

1038
00:51:11,097 --> 00:51:15,264
When she's in a women's
prison and they (mumbling).

1039
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:21,344
Bingo.

1040
00:51:22,275 --> 00:51:24,173
We got a glitch.

1041
00:51:24,173 --> 00:51:25,461
- Where?

1042
00:51:25,461 --> 00:51:27,063
- This is radar data from

1043
00:51:27,063 --> 00:51:28,689
from, from, from Grasso.

1044
00:51:28,689 --> 00:51:29,554
From Oak Shield,

1045
00:51:29,554 --> 00:51:30,822
from Red Watch.

1046
00:51:30,822 --> 00:51:32,905
From all over California.

1047
00:51:34,155 --> 00:51:35,290
Yep, quarter second.

1048
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:38,373
Quarter second radar failure at 6:24.

1049
00:51:41,089 --> 00:51:44,422
Hold on I'm checking control tower data.

1050
00:51:45,704 --> 00:51:47,251
You see, you see, you see

1051
00:51:47,251 --> 00:51:48,680
the same deal.

1052
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:49,513
6:24.

1053
00:51:51,837 --> 00:51:53,237
- Can you chart up,

1054
00:51:53,237 --> 00:51:57,524
show me all the stations
that had that glitch

1055
00:51:57,524 --> 00:51:59,106
all the ones that had it at the same time

1056
00:51:59,106 --> 00:52:00,201
6:24?

1057
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:01,160
- Sure, sure, sure, sure

1058
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,436
I can tap into anything
they can come up with

1059
00:52:02,436 --> 00:52:03,686
those bastards.

1060
00:52:06,094 --> 00:52:07,686
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1061
00:52:07,686 --> 00:52:10,231
Now I'm going to do a kind of a graphic

1062
00:52:10,231 --> 00:52:12,981
kind of chart thing for you here.

1063
00:52:14,335 --> 00:52:15,372
Okay, okay, okay.

1064
00:52:15,372 --> 00:52:17,723
Here we have two (mumbles)

1065
00:52:17,723 --> 00:52:20,140
and they create a little egg.

1066
00:52:21,082 --> 00:52:22,825
- [Stephanie] That's weird.

1067
00:52:22,825 --> 00:52:26,593
- So if Mount Aurora is
one of the two points...

1068
00:52:26,593 --> 00:52:30,240
- Well just have to do some
high powered calculating,

1069
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,073
won't we.

1070
00:52:33,896 --> 00:52:34,729
Yes, yes.

1071
00:52:37,878 --> 00:52:38,789
- What's up?

1072
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:42,004
- [Stephanie] We may have found something.

1073
00:52:42,004 --> 00:52:42,837
- Hey boo-boo,

1074
00:52:42,837 --> 00:52:47,004
we've got ourselves a great
big picnic basket for ya.

1075
00:52:50,136 --> 00:52:52,469
There we have the full size.

1076
00:52:53,658 --> 00:52:56,885
Major focus at your
favorite spot and mine.

1077
00:52:56,885 --> 00:52:58,885
Mount Aurora California.

1078
00:53:00,632 --> 00:53:04,150
And minor focuses at Yuma Arizona.

1079
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:05,855
- [Voiceover] Yuma Arizona.

1080
00:53:05,855 --> 00:53:07,836
- Actually about 50 miles north of Yuma

1081
00:53:07,836 --> 00:53:09,407
right on the California border.

1082
00:53:09,407 --> 00:53:10,853
Okay here we go,

1083
00:53:10,853 --> 00:53:11,773
here we go.

1084
00:53:11,773 --> 00:53:13,190
Williston Arizona

1085
00:53:14,103 --> 00:53:15,353
population 235.

1086
00:53:19,111 --> 00:53:24,059
Major industry Herman's
gas station on the corner.

1087
00:53:24,059 --> 00:53:26,180
- Gee I don't know about this.

1088
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:27,561
I mean it seems awfully thin

1089
00:53:27,561 --> 00:53:29,663
for us to just go running off to Arizona.

1090
00:53:29,663 --> 00:53:32,946
What are we supposed to
do when we get there?

1091
00:53:32,946 --> 00:53:36,019
- I didn't know you
were planing on coming.

1092
00:53:36,019 --> 00:53:37,503
- Oh um, well.

1093
00:53:37,503 --> 00:53:39,990
- Ah, it's a romance.

1094
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:41,524
It's a romance.

1095
00:53:41,524 --> 00:53:42,941
- Arthur shut up.

1096
00:53:44,103 --> 00:53:46,713
- Don't get me wrong you're welcome to.

1097
00:53:46,713 --> 00:53:50,361
- Well I guess I just
thought that I was onboard.

1098
00:53:50,361 --> 00:53:52,353
But I still don't know if we should

1099
00:53:52,353 --> 00:53:54,334
just go running off to Arizona.

1100
00:53:54,334 --> 00:53:55,167
- Here's something.

1101
00:53:55,167 --> 00:53:56,841
Look what we have here.

1102
00:53:56,841 --> 00:53:58,924
Seismic readings at 6:23.

1103
00:54:01,163 --> 00:54:02,543
Here, here, here.

1104
00:54:02,543 --> 00:54:07,124
In the totally unfault like
terrain of the scorpion state

1105
00:54:07,124 --> 00:54:08,188
see it?

1106
00:54:08,188 --> 00:54:09,555
Still thin huh?

1107
00:54:09,555 --> 00:54:10,471
Still thin,

1108
00:54:10,471 --> 00:54:11,787
ah it's very thin.

1109
00:54:11,787 --> 00:54:13,870
- Okay, okay Arthur okay.

1110
00:54:15,075 --> 00:54:17,472
Okay I'm convinced.

1111
00:54:17,472 --> 00:54:19,460
But what are we going
to do when we get there?

1112
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:22,727
- Why are we going to Arizona?

1113
00:54:22,727 --> 00:54:25,014
- To find Zarkorrs off switch.

1114
00:54:25,014 --> 00:54:27,754
- Zarkorrs off switch is in Arizona?

1115
00:54:27,754 --> 00:54:30,022
- Now say thank you.

1116
00:54:30,022 --> 00:54:30,855
- Why.

1117
00:54:32,476 --> 00:54:35,433
- Well first because I
didn't have you arrested

1118
00:54:35,433 --> 00:54:37,809
and more recently because I
just booked you on a flight

1119
00:54:37,809 --> 00:54:41,976
for Phoenix Arizona leaving
from New Ark at about 3:05.

1120
00:54:43,663 --> 00:54:46,170
From there you'll catch a commuter flight

1121
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:50,368
that'll put you down in hope
at the Tommy Marshal air field,

1122
00:54:50,368 --> 00:54:52,470
that's just outside of Yuma,

1123
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:55,459
it's about 40 miles from Williston.

1124
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:57,974
I've arranged for a rental
car to be delivered there

1125
00:54:57,974 --> 00:55:01,372
for your enjoyment and edification.

1126
00:55:01,372 --> 00:55:04,526
Stephanie you've got a
lot of work to do now.

1127
00:55:04,526 --> 00:55:07,161
You get these guys measurements,

1128
00:55:07,161 --> 00:55:10,070
take them into town and
buy then some clothes.

1129
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:11,946
Do you want to show up at the airport

1130
00:55:11,946 --> 00:55:14,029
with a cop and a mailman?

1131
00:55:18,501 --> 00:55:22,668
Tommy ol' boy this is a
global positioning receiver.

1132
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,784
The seismic and radar
data can only pinpoint

1133
00:55:26,784 --> 00:55:29,451
the location with in 1000 yards,

1134
00:55:30,974 --> 00:55:34,724
with this you know you're
in the right place.

1135
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,967
And then, then you're on your
own you sorry bastard you.

1136
00:55:42,875 --> 00:55:45,625
Okay guys, okay guys get to work.

1137
00:55:46,786 --> 00:55:47,786
Get to work.

1138
00:56:00,564 --> 00:56:04,659
- I can't get this global
positioning thing to work.

1139
00:56:04,659 --> 00:56:05,826
- Holy Christ.

1140
00:56:06,737 --> 00:56:09,395
The whole town is gone.

1141
00:56:09,395 --> 00:56:10,315
- [Stephanie] No it isn't.

1142
00:56:10,315 --> 00:56:11,728
Look up there.

1143
00:56:11,728 --> 00:56:12,938
- Where?

1144
00:56:12,938 --> 00:56:14,938
- Those lights up there.

1145
00:56:17,111 --> 00:56:19,041
- We got trouble.

1146
00:56:19,041 --> 00:56:21,289
- Okay let's get ready.

1147
00:56:21,289 --> 00:56:23,956
(ominous music)

1148
00:56:44,057 --> 00:56:46,307
- Wow this is really eerie.

1149
00:56:48,774 --> 00:56:52,325
- We've made a pilgrimage into the desert.

1150
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:54,366
The wilderness of sin,

1151
00:56:54,366 --> 00:56:58,533
it's all part of the mythic
journey to the god state.

1152
00:57:01,811 --> 00:57:03,948
I mean could be.

1153
00:57:03,948 --> 00:57:04,781
I guess.

1154
00:57:06,035 --> 00:57:07,436
- We've got company.

1155
00:57:07,436 --> 00:57:09,871
- Okay just hold your ground.

1156
00:57:09,871 --> 00:57:11,963
- Well you folks sure took your good

1157
00:57:11,963 --> 00:57:14,213
sweet time in getting here.

1158
00:57:16,862 --> 00:57:21,029
Well you are the government
people we sent for aren't you?

1159
00:57:24,477 --> 00:57:26,670
- That's right and you're marshal--

1160
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:27,514
- Sheriff.

1161
00:57:27,514 --> 00:57:28,551
Sheriff Rockard.

1162
00:57:28,551 --> 00:57:29,715
- Right sheriff

1163
00:57:29,715 --> 00:57:31,889
well I'm Dr Martin from
the state department.

1164
00:57:31,889 --> 00:57:33,024
- Howdy.

1165
00:57:33,024 --> 00:57:33,857
- Nice to meet you.

1166
00:57:33,857 --> 00:57:35,190
This is Dr Ward.

1167
00:57:36,127 --> 00:57:37,765
- Please to meet you.

1168
00:57:37,765 --> 00:57:38,640
- And Dr--

1169
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,550
- Dr Ray.

1170
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:40,570
You can call me George.

1171
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:41,556
- George.

1172
00:57:41,556 --> 00:57:44,344
Well this here's Ben Wells
he's our local geologist.

1173
00:57:44,344 --> 00:57:45,177
- Welcome doctor.

1174
00:57:45,177 --> 00:57:46,160
- Thank you, nice to meet you.

1175
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:46,993
- Nice to meet you.

1176
00:57:46,993 --> 00:57:48,087
- [Ben] Pleasure doctor.

1177
00:57:48,087 --> 00:57:49,006
Thank you for coming.

1178
00:57:49,006 --> 00:57:49,853
- [Tommy] Mr Wells.

1179
00:57:49,853 --> 00:57:52,213
- And this here's Quincy
he runs the dinner here.

1180
00:57:52,213 --> 00:57:53,369
- I'm Dr Ward.

1181
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:55,452
(grunts)

1182
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:00,776
So sheriff lets see what you got.

1183
00:58:00,776 --> 00:58:04,952
- Well no we were just kind
of hoping you'd tell us that.

1184
00:58:04,952 --> 00:58:05,785
Follow me.

1185
00:58:07,032 --> 00:58:09,782
(dramatic music)

1186
00:58:22,354 --> 00:58:23,916
- What you are seeing here are previously

1187
00:58:23,916 --> 00:58:26,212
recorded scenes of the aurora monster

1188
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:28,528
filmed along his destructive trek

1189
00:58:28,528 --> 00:58:30,851
originating at Mount Aurora California

1190
00:58:30,851 --> 00:58:33,453
and continuing east through Arizona.

1191
00:58:33,453 --> 00:58:35,977
Current reports indicate the
Aurora animal has changed

1192
00:58:35,977 --> 00:58:37,297
its course.

1193
00:58:37,297 --> 00:58:39,977
It is now on a heading that
will take it just north of Yuma,

1194
00:58:39,977 --> 00:58:42,141
provided military--

1195
00:58:42,141 --> 00:58:44,808
- Tommy it's changing direction.

1196
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,220
I think it's coming after you.

1197
00:58:49,385 --> 00:58:50,684
(dramatic music)

1198
00:58:50,684 --> 00:58:52,351
- That's comforting.

1199
00:58:53,421 --> 00:58:54,421
- Oh my god.

1200
00:58:55,368 --> 00:58:57,201
- Turn that thing off.

1201
00:59:01,734 --> 00:59:03,984
- [Quincy] It's okay buddy.

1202
00:59:10,489 --> 00:59:13,156
(ominous music)

1203
00:59:18,808 --> 00:59:20,533
- Did anybody see it hit?

1204
00:59:20,533 --> 00:59:24,581
- Hell yeah came down like a cannon shot.

1205
00:59:24,581 --> 00:59:27,582
- Yeah we've been calling around
for the last couple of days

1206
00:59:27,582 --> 00:59:29,283
trying to get somebody to come down here

1207
00:59:29,283 --> 00:59:31,474
and take a look at this thing.

1208
00:59:31,474 --> 00:59:33,667
Hell to my way of thinking

1209
00:59:33,667 --> 00:59:36,098
this just ain't natural.

1210
00:59:36,098 --> 00:59:38,076
- Let's get it cleared off.

1211
00:59:38,076 --> 00:59:40,243
(mumbles)

1212
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,516
(ominous music)

1213
00:59:43,516 --> 00:59:45,464
- So has it done anything
since it got in here?

1214
00:59:45,464 --> 00:59:47,776
- Nope just sort of sits around.

1215
00:59:47,776 --> 00:59:49,707
But I did find something interesting.

1216
00:59:49,707 --> 00:59:51,026
- [Stephanie] What's that?

1217
00:59:51,026 --> 00:59:53,973
- I tried to do a scratch test on it

1218
00:59:53,973 --> 00:59:56,318
to see what it was made out of.

1219
00:59:56,318 --> 00:59:57,996
Watch this.

1220
00:59:57,996 --> 01:00:00,263
This is a diamond.

1221
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,096
Watch.

1222
01:00:02,693 --> 01:00:05,360
(ominous music)

1223
01:00:08,106 --> 01:00:10,591
All right explain that?

1224
01:00:10,591 --> 01:00:12,562
- Hell buddy here tried
an arc welder on it.

1225
01:00:12,562 --> 01:00:14,509
Didn't do a damn thing.

1226
01:00:14,509 --> 01:00:17,429
- Tell you what if this
things harder than a diamond

1227
01:00:17,429 --> 01:00:18,935
there's nothing on this
earth that's going to open

1228
01:00:18,935 --> 01:00:19,768
this up.

1229
01:00:20,679 --> 01:00:23,193
Providing something's inside of it.

1230
01:00:23,193 --> 01:00:25,693
- God these look like windows.

1231
01:00:26,551 --> 01:00:28,137
Have you tried to open it?

1232
01:00:28,137 --> 01:00:30,527
- Doctor we've done
everything humanly possible

1233
01:00:30,527 --> 01:00:31,439
to try to penetrate this

1234
01:00:31,439 --> 01:00:33,538
and we can't do it.

1235
01:00:33,538 --> 01:00:36,205
(ominous music)

1236
01:00:37,829 --> 01:00:39,535
- Let's get it in the car.

1237
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:40,702
- Now hold on,

1238
01:00:41,564 --> 01:00:44,304
Doctor how do we know that
by you moving this thing

1239
01:00:44,304 --> 01:00:46,321
it's not going to explode?

1240
01:00:46,321 --> 01:00:47,452
- Yeah.

1241
01:00:47,452 --> 01:00:48,561
- We don't.

1242
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:51,027
And if I were you I'd get out of way.

1243
01:00:51,027 --> 01:00:53,777
(dramatic music)

1244
01:01:24,259 --> 01:01:28,468
- [Voiceover] Hey, hey you doctor, doctor.

1245
01:01:28,468 --> 01:01:29,722
Hey there.

1246
01:01:29,722 --> 01:01:31,686
I'd like to see some credentials.

1247
01:01:31,686 --> 01:01:33,285
Hey.

1248
01:01:33,285 --> 01:01:36,535
- Now you just wait a minute right now.

1249
01:01:37,708 --> 01:01:41,375
You, did you ever hear
of national security?

1250
01:01:42,766 --> 01:01:44,109
Did ya?

1251
01:01:44,109 --> 01:01:45,132
- Now you just wait a second.

1252
01:01:45,132 --> 01:01:47,215
- No you wait, all of ya.

1253
01:01:48,272 --> 01:01:51,772
Now are any of you aware that this country

1254
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:58,860
is in the midst of a
crisis of international

1255
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:00,718
and interplanetary importance?

1256
01:02:00,718 --> 01:02:01,872
Are ya?

1257
01:02:01,872 --> 01:02:03,284
- What are you talking about?

1258
01:02:03,284 --> 01:02:05,514
Oh you mean that monster?

1259
01:02:05,514 --> 01:02:09,681
- What are you some sort
of god damn question asker?

1260
01:02:11,073 --> 01:02:12,087
Well mister where I come from

1261
01:02:12,087 --> 01:02:13,142
we know when to ask
questions and we know when to

1262
01:02:13,142 --> 01:02:14,605
button our lips and follow orders.

1263
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:15,721
Am I getting through to you?

1264
01:02:15,721 --> 01:02:16,632
- Now you just hold on.

1265
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:17,799
- You hold on.
