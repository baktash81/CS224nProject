1
00:01:14,413 --> 00:01:21,056
50 years ago, an alien force known
as the Formics attacked Earth.

2
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:23,126
10 millions died.

3
00:01:24,962 --> 00:01:27,300
It was only through the sacrifice of our greatest commander

4
00:01:27,301 --> 00:01:30,437
that we avoided total annihilation.

5
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:48,532
We've been preparing for them to come back,
ever since.

6
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:50,234
The International Fleet decided

7
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,639
that the world's smartest children
are the planet's best hope.

8
00:01:53,906 --> 00:02:00,182
Raised on war-games, their decisions
are intuitive, decisive, fearless.

9
00:02:00,183 --> 00:02:03,720
I am one of those recruits.

10
00:02:05,056 --> 00:02:06,659
I've watched through his eyes,

11
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,263
I've listened through his ears

12
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:13,903
and I tell you, he's THE ONE!

13
00:02:13,904 --> 00:02:16,439
That's what you said about his brother.

14
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,110
Brother tested out impossible for other reasons

15
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:22,148
... nothing to do with his tactical abilities.

16
00:02:22,448 --> 00:02:24,852
- I gotcha! I gotcha!
- Try there... go back!

17
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:28,124
He's gonna crush 'em.

18
00:02:29,826 --> 00:02:31,078
God!!

19
00:02:32,463 --> 00:02:34,834
- You can't do that.
- You've got to use what is around you.

20
00:02:34,835 --> 00:02:36,870
No no,
I had you all the way through the belt!

21
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:40,009
You might have calculated your trajectory
wrong due to the incoming asteroids.

22
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,478
Don't.. lecture me. Wiggin.
You cheated!

23
00:02:44,148 --> 00:02:46,484
It was a good game...

24
00:02:47,186 --> 00:02:49,022
Thanks.

25
00:02:51,592 --> 00:02:53,362
HEY!

26
00:02:58,236 --> 00:02:59,839
Play again!

27
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,773
Sorry.

28
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,244
Tomorrow, maybe?

29
00:03:03,245 --> 00:03:06,248
You see, he's got a talent for strategy.

30
00:03:06,249 --> 00:03:08,251
His humility could be false,

31
00:03:08,252 --> 00:03:12,490
part of a strategy to avoid antagonizing
an ego-driven opponent.

32
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:14,326
Which makes him even smarter.

33
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,229
He may be a genius but we need someone

34
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,000
the others will follow . A leader.
He can't win on his own.

35
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:22,305
Well, let's see how he handles rejection.

36
00:03:23,274 --> 00:03:29,349
Andrew Wiggin! Andrew... Ender Wiggin...
Please report to the infirmary!

37
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,987
Ender Wiggin to the infirmary.

38
00:03:39,831 --> 00:03:42,035
- Hello Ender!
- Hello!

39
00:03:42,036 --> 00:03:44,038
That nasty monitor is coming out today.

40
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:46,308
Please, lie face down.

41
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,413
Am I off the program?

42
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,721
- Did I do something wrong?
- That's not really for me to say.

43
00:04:01,998 --> 00:04:03,567
Lie down.

44
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:06,705
The sooner we get this done,
the sooner you can move on.

45
00:04:19,057 --> 00:04:20,059
Ready?

46
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,895
This won't hurt a bit.

47
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:58,416
Where do you think you're going, Wiggin?

48
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:00,686
Washed out, huh?

49
00:05:00,687 --> 00:05:04,726
<i>- Come on!
- Come on! Get him in there!</i>

50
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:14,473
Come on, chief... one on one,
for real this time.

51
00:05:14,474 --> 00:05:18,279
- No games.
- He's got no monitor now.

52
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,284
No one wants you now, Wiggin.

53
00:05:21,285 --> 00:05:27,460
One-on-one,
then why are your boys holding me?

54
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:29,296
Let's go!

55
00:05:29,297 --> 00:05:31,399
Come on, man!

56
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:46,021
- Stay down.
- I'm gonna kill you, chief (???)

57
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:50,661
Take it easy, Ender.

58
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:59,842
You might be thinking of
ganging up on me...

59
00:05:59,843 --> 00:06:03,180
But just remember what I do to people
who try to hurt me.

60
00:06:16,934 --> 00:06:19,070
He said I was cheating...

61
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:22,676
he said that was why I was off the program.
And I kept on kicking him...

62
00:06:22,677 --> 00:06:25,347
- Doesn't matter.
- ...even after he was down.

63
00:06:25,348 --> 00:06:29,253
- He will never bully you again.
- All I could think was...

64
00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:32,223
...what would Peter do?

65
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:38,266
- I'm just like him, now.
- No. No, you're nothing like him Ender.

66
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:39,801
Nothing like whom?

67
00:06:39,802 --> 00:06:42,438
- I thought you had a game.
- Rained out...

68
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,642
- What's he crying about?
- I'm not crying!

69
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:48,181
My monitor's gone. Now I'm just like you.

70
00:06:48,182 --> 00:06:52,120
You mean Mom & Dad spent all that money on a Third
and now he's off the program, too?

71
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:54,757
Stop it, Peter. He made it farther than either of us.

72
00:06:54,758 --> 00:06:58,563
Hey, drop out!
Remember how to play formics and astronauts?

73
00:06:58,564 --> 00:07:01,767
- That's it. Where is mom?
- No. Don't.

74
00:07:01,768 --> 00:07:06,809
- I'll play.
- Put the mask on... you can be the bug.

75
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:11,649
<i>- Peter, you're sick!
- Stay out of this, Valentine.</i>

76
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:17,024
<i>- Okay bug. You started it. You attack first.
- Let me in.</i>

77
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,700
<i>- Come on, fight back. At last, we've got one of you alive.
- Peter, stop!</i>

78
00:07:23,701 --> 00:07:27,673
You know, I could kill you just like this.

79
00:07:28,808 --> 00:07:32,180
- Please!
- I should've been chosen!

80
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:48,271
Deep Space intel shows us that the
number of enemy ships already

81
00:07:48,272 --> 00:07:52,811
deployed is 10 times those
we faced during the first invasion.

82
00:07:52,812 --> 00:07:58,352
The Formics are rebuilding and strengthening
their fleet. We must conquer or die.

83
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,821
Turn it off please, John.

84
00:07:59,822 --> 00:08:01,992
Why? You'd rather not know
what's going on in the world?

85
00:08:01,993 --> 00:08:08,167
We must never again bear witness
to the slaughter of tens of millions of innocent people

86
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:09,769
I'd rather you talk to your son.

87
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:14,977
Our survival demands total commitment
to the destruction of the enemy...

88
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:18,316
If you want, I'll go away.
So you don't have to be embarrassed.

89
00:08:18,317 --> 00:08:21,387
Ender, no one is embarrassed.

90
00:08:21,687 --> 00:08:25,159
I am a Third.
I should never have been born.

91
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,530
No. We wanted you, Ender.
We just needed permission.

92
00:08:32,103 --> 00:08:36,276
John, please say something.

93
00:08:37,946 --> 00:08:40,249
It's a tough program, Ender.

94
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:46,592
When they brought me to this country,
there was less competition and still I didn't make it.

95
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:50,130
You have nothing to be ashamed of...

96
00:08:50,131 --> 00:08:51,967
...nothing.

97
00:08:53,302 --> 00:08:57,275
<i>#Sensor alert! Front door...
Please state your name.#</i>

98
00:08:57,276 --> 00:09:05,152
Colonel Hyrum Graff, Director of Training, International Fleet.
This is my colleague, Major Anderson. May we?

99
00:09:05,153 --> 00:09:07,790
Why'd you keep kicking him?
You had already won the fight.

100
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,227
- Did you enjoy it?
- No.

101
00:09:10,228 --> 00:09:13,465
Then why? Speak up, son.

102
00:09:15,468 --> 00:09:19,975
Knocking him down was the first fight.

103
00:09:20,475 --> 00:09:22,813
I wanted to win all the next ones, too.

104
00:09:22,814 --> 00:09:24,582
So they'd leave me alone.

105
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,852
Don't you think you should have
asked a grown up for help?

106
00:09:26,853 --> 00:09:32,393
Nonsense! He can fight his own battles.
Colonel, he was obviously being bullied and he defended himself.

107
00:09:32,394 --> 00:09:34,230
Son...

108
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:39,204
I'd like to offer you a place in our program.

109
00:09:44,512 --> 00:09:46,314
But you took away my monitor.

110
00:09:46,315 --> 00:09:51,256
The final step in our evaluation is always to
see what happens when the monitor is removed.

111
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,927
And he passed?
He put a child in the hospital.

112
00:09:54,928 --> 00:10:00,570
It's not what he did, it's why he did it.
It was tactical, a strategy to stop future attacks.

113
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:03,307
Andrew, you don't have to do this.

114
00:10:03,308 --> 00:10:06,612
Ender and I should have
a private conversation.

115
00:10:06,613 --> 00:10:13,189
- Absolutely not.
- With all respect sir, you really can't stop me.

116
00:10:14,924 --> 00:10:17,896
Formics might have wiped us
out the last time, you know.

117
00:10:20,132 --> 00:10:24,739
A brilliant commander is the
only thing that saved us.

118
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,809
Mazer Rackham?

119
00:10:27,243 --> 00:10:31,516
Mazer Rackham!
We need minds like yours, Ender.

120
00:10:31,517 --> 00:10:36,256
Young people integrate complex data more easily than adults.

121
00:10:37,892 --> 00:10:40,229
Will the monitor be reinstalled?

122
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,980
No.

123
00:10:41,697 --> 00:10:44,201
You graduated.

124
00:10:44,202 --> 00:10:47,273
To Battle School.

125
00:10:47,274 --> 00:10:51,612
Privacy rights are restored.

126
00:10:51,613 --> 00:11:00,259
If there's a chance, because of you, the Formics
might leave us alone forever...

127
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,233
then I have to ask you to come with me.

128
00:11:09,306 --> 00:11:12,410
It's what I was born for, right?

129
00:11:15,448 --> 00:11:18,152
Valentine was too compassionate for Battle School.

130
00:11:25,163 --> 00:11:28,502
My brother Peter washed out
because he was too quick to violence.

131
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:35,545
Colonel Graff said I needed to find a balance
between those emotions if I were to succeed.

132
00:11:42,689 --> 00:11:44,491
Join the others.

133
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,029
Go on!

134
00:12:02,052 --> 00:12:05,457
- You're late!
- Out of my control.

135
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,426
I'm Ender.

136
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:12,333
Ender?
What kind of name is that?

137
00:12:12,334 --> 00:12:14,971
What's your name?

138
00:12:15,672 --> 00:12:17,007
Name is Bean.

139
00:12:17,008 --> 00:12:21,982
- Bean?
- Grew up on the streets, not with a bean. (???)

140
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,497
- I'm gonna be...
- Bag! Give him the bag!

141
00:13:27,613 --> 00:13:29,850
Close the bag!

142
00:13:32,788 --> 00:13:34,957
- You alright?
- Yeah.

143
00:13:37,728 --> 00:13:39,498
What're you doing, Wiggin?

144
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:42,569
- Nothing, sir.
- Something funny?

145
00:13:43,404 --> 00:13:46,008
I asked you a question, launchy.

146
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:52,083
Sir, the way you're floating. Horizontally.
I thought that was funny.

147
00:13:52,084 --> 00:13:53,185
Really, why?

148
00:13:53,186 --> 00:13:56,857
Because in zero gravity, there is no right side up.

149
00:13:56,858 --> 00:14:00,429
You may think you're vertical and we may be horizontal.

150
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,400
- Is that funny?
- Sir, no sir!

151
00:14:04,068 --> 00:14:05,670
Yes, it is.

152
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:09,243
Alai, you know what he is talking about?

153
00:14:09,244 --> 00:14:11,612
- Yes, sir.
- No, you don't.

154
00:14:12,047 --> 00:14:17,154
There's only one kid on this launch
with any brains at all so far...

155
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:19,224
...and that's Ender Wiggin.

156
00:14:57,147 --> 00:15:02,088
<i>#All new arrivals follow the yellow lights
to your accommodation. The yellow lights.#</i>

157
00:15:08,565 --> 00:15:13,605
<i>#All new arrivals follow the yellow lights
to your accommodation. The yellow lights.#</i>

158
00:15:14,106 --> 00:15:15,808
So you made them hate me.

159
00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:17,879
I told them you were the best.

160
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,516
We need a Julius Caesar, a Napoleon.

161
00:15:20,517 --> 00:15:21,885
We hope that would be you.

162
00:15:21,886 --> 00:15:26,559
- Caesar was assassinated by the people he trusted.
- Napoleon lost in the end.

163
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:30,397
Not before he conquered the known world.

164
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:33,435
- Dismissed.
- Yes, sir.

165
00:15:38,342 --> 00:15:41,314
He has a complicated response to authority.

166
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:46,321
He wants to please the overbearing father figure
but resents the lack of reciprocated affection.

167
00:15:46,322 --> 00:15:48,024
His isolation can never be broken

168
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:52,030
and he must never believe anyone will help him.

169
00:15:52,397 --> 00:15:54,934
Oh look. It's the smartass.

170
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:05,149
Thanks!
Thought I'd have to ask to be by the door.

171
00:16:12,828 --> 00:16:17,568
<i>#State your name.#
- Ender Wiggin.</i>

172
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:27,149
- Don't freeze your balls, kid.
- Attention on deck.

173
00:16:27,683 --> 00:16:29,253
At ease.

174
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,756
Listen up, Launchies!

175
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:41,237
My name is Sergeant James Dap. Ask me a
legitimate question and I will give you a direct answer..

176
00:16:41,238 --> 00:16:45,743
but if you are looking for a shoulder
to cry on, use your pillow.

177
00:16:46,411 --> 00:16:50,785
- Do I look like I'm joking, snots?
- Sir! No, sir!

178
00:16:50,786 --> 00:16:54,256
Good.
You are to work as a team..

179
00:16:54,257 --> 00:16:59,164
You will all make this bunkroom, your home.
You will keep your home clean.

180
00:16:59,165 --> 00:17:01,201
There are separate showers for both sexes.

181
00:17:01,202 --> 00:17:05,207
If you are found in an area not designated to your gender,

182
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:10,080
I will personally neuter you.
- Am I clear?

183
00:17:14,921 --> 00:17:21,564
- Class is in five. Follow the yellow lights.
Yellow like your cowardly selves.

184
00:17:22,098 --> 00:17:24,101
Welcome to Battle School.

185
00:17:24,102 --> 00:17:27,173
A great responsibility rests on each of you.

186
00:17:27,174 --> 00:17:30,210
When the enemy first invaded, we were not ready.

187
00:17:30,211 --> 00:17:33,315
Millions of innocent lives were lost.

188
00:17:33,316 --> 00:17:36,554
That must never be allowed to happen again.

189
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:41,761
We threw everything we had at the invaders.
And in the midst of that decisive battle,

190
00:17:43,297 --> 00:17:46,268
a legendary hero emerged.

191
00:18:40,716 --> 00:18:43,988
We will never forget what the enemy did

192
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,058
but we defeated them.

193
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:49,729
and we will do so again.

194
00:18:50,097 --> 00:18:56,406
Let the courage of Mazer Rackham
be your inspiration.

195
00:18:56,674 --> 00:18:59,478
Wakey wakey.
Rise and shine.

196
00:18:59,479 --> 00:19:01,146
Put on your Battle Room suits

197
00:19:01,147 --> 00:19:04,686
That's the padded one with the helmet and the weapon.

198
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:07,523
Do not attempt to fire the weapon.

199
00:19:07,524 --> 00:19:13,799
Holster it! Let's move it launchies, you've got 10 minutes!

200
00:19:21,477 --> 00:19:23,747
At ease!

201
00:19:23,981 --> 00:19:25,383
This is the Battle Room.

202
00:19:25,384 --> 00:19:30,658
In here, the floor's been designed
to create an Earth-like gravitational pull.

203
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:35,933
Step through that gate
and you are in a zero-G environment.

204
00:19:41,842 --> 00:19:45,112
Wiggin!
Get up here.

205
00:20:13,189 --> 00:20:18,830
- What do I do now, sir?
- Go on in.

206
00:20:36,189 --> 00:20:40,095
Alright now, push off.

207
00:21:35,578 --> 00:21:36,814
Nicely done.

208
00:21:36,815 --> 00:21:39,852
These guys are still trying to
stay up the way they came in.

209
00:21:39,853 --> 00:21:43,257
But like you said in the shuttle,
there is no up or down in space.

210
00:21:43,258 --> 00:21:46,228
But we'll need some way
to orientate in here...

211
00:21:46,229 --> 00:21:48,898
...maybe the enemy's gate is down?

212
00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:56,043
- I get it, like they're a bug to be
crushed under our feet.

213
00:21:59,113 --> 00:22:03,454
- What do you think this does?
- Let's find out.

214
00:22:12,734 --> 00:22:15,272
Whoa! Won't acts harmless... (???)

215
00:22:15,273 --> 00:22:20,613
- What do you think it does when it hits the suit?
- Good question.

216
00:22:26,855 --> 00:22:31,662
- Shoot me in the leg.
- We shoot each other. Same time.

217
00:22:32,297 --> 00:22:34,000
Ready?

218
00:22:40,843 --> 00:22:45,350
- Whoa! My leg's frozen!
- Mine too.

219
00:22:45,683 --> 00:22:47,520
I can't bend my knee...

220
00:22:50,725 --> 00:22:56,099
Shoot me in the chest...
Come on! I'm getting away.

221
00:23:01,341 --> 00:23:07,716
- This is amazing...
I can't move at all now.

222
00:23:07,717 --> 00:23:09,719
That's enough.

223
00:23:24,441 --> 00:23:27,480
You're flapping around like
a bunch of drunken ducks.

224
00:23:27,481 --> 00:23:31,186
If you expect to compete with the
other teams in this School...

225
00:23:31,187 --> 00:23:36,093
... you've got a lot to learn.
Sergeant, explain the game!

226
00:23:37,295 --> 00:23:41,734
You will train to compete as a team
against other teams.

227
00:23:41,735 --> 00:23:45,173
You get 1 point for a hit to a limb,
six for a torso hit

228
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:47,844
- which will immobilize you completely -...

229
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:53,853
...but if either side gets one cadet
through the enemy's gate unharmed...

230
00:23:53,854 --> 00:23:56,990
...that army will win.
Regardless of points already scored.

231
00:23:56,991 --> 00:24:00,429
- Am I clear?
- Sir! Yes Sir!

232
00:24:00,896 --> 00:24:06,104
Dear Valentine, so this is Battle School...
Every day, hours of training...

233
00:24:06,105 --> 00:24:09,243
...and far more homework
than we ever had on Earth.

234
00:24:09,244 --> 00:24:12,748
We train in hand-to-hand combat...

235
00:24:12,749 --> 00:24:14,951
...it keeps us in shape...

236
00:24:14,952 --> 00:24:19,825
...and aggressive.
- And up! And one! Two!

237
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:24,832
- I feel Peter in me whenever I fight...
- Wiggin!

238
00:24:25,267 --> 00:24:26,602
... I wish I didn't.

239
00:24:26,603 --> 00:24:29,940
We've been studying Formic flight
patterns for three months now,...

240
00:24:29,941 --> 00:24:31,776
...they seem entirely random.

241
00:24:31,777 --> 00:24:34,914
The truth is
we really don't understand our enemy...

242
00:24:34,915 --> 00:24:40,856
...and no one ever adequately explains how Mazer Rackham
actually defeated the entire fleet.

243
00:24:41,524 --> 00:24:43,961
The Colonel said he expects me to lead

244
00:24:43,962 --> 00:24:46,865
But how? What makes a good leader?

245
00:24:46,866 --> 00:24:52,508
Everyone here is very different.
So many many things to learn,

246
00:24:52,509 --> 00:24:54,043
always very little sleep.

247
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:56,046
Please write back.

248
00:24:56,047 --> 00:24:58,583
I haven't heard from you...
How are you?

249
00:24:58,584 --> 00:25:02,355
Is Peter behaving?
Are you getting my e-mails? I miss...

250
00:25:02,756 --> 00:25:05,193
Attention on deck!

251
00:25:11,402 --> 00:25:14,841
Evening, launchies. At ease.

252
00:25:15,408 --> 00:25:18,513
I'm pleased to see that most
of you are performing well...

253
00:25:18,514 --> 00:25:21,952
...as you know, competition for
Command School is tough...

254
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:27,226
...some in the higher ranks have failed to
meet our standards and are being sent home.

255
00:25:27,227 --> 00:25:30,931
So... I may have the opportunity
to promote some of you.

256
00:25:30,932 --> 00:25:33,602
Look to your left.

257
00:25:34,671 --> 00:25:37,275
Look to your right.

258
00:25:37,641 --> 00:25:40,946
These are NOT your friends!

259
00:25:40,947 --> 00:25:43,784
They are competition!

260
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:47,857
- Keep up the hard work!
- Ten-shun!

261
00:25:47,858 --> 00:25:52,964
Sir!
Is our email being blocked?

262
00:25:52,965 --> 00:25:55,936
It's just that none of us
received any replies from home.

263
00:25:55,937 --> 00:25:59,007
All communication is being
temporarily held back.

264
00:25:59,008 --> 00:26:02,579
- Why sir?
- Launchy, it is not your place...

265
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:06,351
Your families will not understand
what we're doing here...

266
00:26:06,352 --> 00:26:11,091
...and none of you need the distraction
of their replies!

267
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:14,330
I thought our privacy rights
had been restored, sir.

268
00:26:14,331 --> 00:26:18,937
You have the right to privately
think whatever you wish, Wiggin!

269
00:26:20,873 --> 00:26:25,012
But there's too much at stake to allow your
unfiltered thoughts..

270
00:26:25,013 --> 00:26:28,151
...to leave this facility.

271
00:26:28,818 --> 00:26:29,900
Yes, sir!

272
00:26:38,733 --> 00:26:41,771
Keep it up snot, and you will
never make it to Command School!

273
00:26:41,772 --> 00:26:44,075
- I thought it was a legitimate question.
- What?

274
00:26:44,076 --> 00:26:48,815
- You said if we have a legitimate question...
- Drop and give me twenty!

275
00:26:58,563 --> 00:27:02,068
- You think you're the smartest kid in the School?
- No, sir!

276
00:27:02,069 --> 00:27:04,939
- You will never be a Commander!
I will never salute you!

277
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:09,313
- Yes you will, Sergeant.
- Give me twenty more!

278
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,401
Get up!

279
00:27:22,733 --> 00:27:27,773
You do not speak unless spoken to.
Am I clear?

280
00:27:27,774 --> 00:27:29,776
Sir! Yes, sir!

281
00:27:30,811 --> 00:27:36,453
- Even if I have a legitimate question?
- Shut it, Wiggin!

282
00:27:41,928 --> 00:27:45,066
Now go to sleep. All of you.

283
00:27:57,485 --> 00:28:02,292
You heard him.
Get some sleep.

284
00:28:13,675 --> 00:28:18,082
We've only 3 passing scores on
the Deep Space navigation test.

285
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:21,521
Alai, Bean and Ender!
What happened here?

286
00:28:21,522 --> 00:28:25,193
- They're probably cheating.
- Your mother cheated that's why you look like a plumber.

287
00:28:25,194 --> 00:28:30,535
- Zip it!(???) You think this is a game?
- No, ma'am.

288
00:28:30,935 --> 00:28:33,539
- We are preparing for war!
- Yes, ma'am.

289
00:28:34,073 --> 00:28:38,246
Now the problem was simple...
how do you slingshot your forces...

290
00:28:38,813 --> 00:28:41,885
...into an attack position
on the blind side of this moon...

291
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:46,124
...using the gravitational pull from this planet?
This is basic rocket science, people!

292
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:48,294
Ender! Get down here and explain.

293
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:53,602
Ma'am, I think Bean or Alai
have a better hang on this than I do.

294
00:28:53,603 --> 00:28:56,507
All right.
Alai, come and explain.

295
00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:04,418
Ma'am, we aim to approach the planet
in the direction it's moving...

296
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:09,359
- ...that way we benefit from it's energy of motion.
- Something..?

297
00:29:11,362 --> 00:29:16,469
- Go on, Alai.
- Of course, there's a moon we have to pass here.

298
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,605
That complicates things.

299
00:29:18,172 --> 00:29:20,843
Because the moon's moving in
the opposite direction to us,

300
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:22,646
we get a gravitational break in...

301
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:26,852
Who sent this?

302
00:29:26,853 --> 00:29:28,655
Who sent what, Bernard?

303
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:30,891
Nothing.

304
00:29:33,896 --> 00:29:34,931
Oh.

305
00:29:36,266 --> 00:29:43,810
- If you can't take it Bernard, don't dish it out.
- Yes, ma'am!

306
00:30:32,483 --> 00:30:35,889
Welcome to Games and Recreation.

307
00:30:36,557 --> 00:30:40,062
Cerebral control initiated.

308
00:31:09,138 --> 00:31:14,614
One is poison, one is not.
Choose right and you go to Fairyland.

309
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,950
He's found the mind game.

310
00:31:18,787 --> 00:31:20,790
Decide well, punch or hell!(???)

311
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:38,850
<i>- Ha ha
- Who authorized his access to this?</i>

312
00:31:38,851 --> 00:31:40,853
<i>- I did.
-Try again, Mickey Mouse.</i>

313
00:31:40,854 --> 00:31:44,859
- To what end?
- Not every battle can be won, Hyrum.

314
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,831
...reveals his state of mind. If you
won't let me assess him one-on-one,

315
00:31:47,832 --> 00:31:49,900
I need some other way to know
what he's feeling.

316
00:31:49,901 --> 00:31:54,440
I don't care how he's feeling.
I want him to toughen up, learn how to lead.

317
00:31:54,441 --> 00:31:57,946
But before we make him a leader,
let's see how he deals with frustration.

318
00:32:10,565 --> 00:32:12,568
<i>- Come on!
- Oh dear!</i>

319
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:16,740
-Whatchu doin?
- Playing a stupid game.

320
00:32:16,741 --> 00:32:18,242
No matter what I choose, I die.

321
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:22,516
- It's rigged.
- You're back. One more time.

322
00:32:22,517 --> 00:32:24,519
- Can I watch?
- Sure.

323
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:30,561
<i>One is poison, one is not. Choose
right and you go to Fairyland.</i>

324
00:32:30,562 --> 00:32:32,531
- Which you gonna choose?
- Neither.

325
00:32:34,066 --> 00:32:36,103
<i>Come on Mickey Mouse,
come on.......</i>

326
00:32:39,641 --> 00:32:40,362
<i>Aaah!!</i>

327
00:32:55,565 --> 00:33:01,106
- You killed him. Why?
- That's what they want from us.

328
00:33:02,108 --> 00:33:05,079
Follow the rules, you lose.
Choose violence, you win.

329
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:09,619
- I've never seen anyone do that.
- Perfect....

330
00:33:10,087 --> 00:33:12,123
He's perfect!

331
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:19,168
Ender Wiggin, you are assigned to Salamander army,
Commander Bonzo Madrid, effective immediately.

332
00:33:19,169 --> 00:33:24,175
Orders of Colonel Graff. Follow the green lights.
Take nothing with you. Go now.

333
00:33:26,144 --> 00:33:28,782
-What are they doing?
- They're promoting you.

334
00:33:39,965 --> 00:33:41,467
Ender!?

335
00:33:41,468 --> 00:33:42,719
Yeah?

336
00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:51,216
'As-salaam-aleykum'.
Peace to you.

337
00:33:59,428 --> 00:34:03,835
- C'mon!
- Ball ! Strike two! Play ball!

338
00:34:04,435 --> 00:34:07,373
- Alright, sir - strike two.
- Play ball!

339
00:34:11,212 --> 00:34:13,649
You lost, Launchy?

340
00:34:13,883 --> 00:34:15,953
I'm Ender Wiggin...

341
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:20,092
...supposed to report to Bonzo Madrid.

342
00:34:20,093 --> 00:34:21,727
So you're the replacement?

343
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:24,265
- Ender Wiggin.
- Petra Arkanian.

344
00:34:24,266 --> 00:34:28,104
Only girl in the Salamander army with more
balls than anybody else in this bunk room.

345
00:34:28,105 --> 00:34:31,108
Whoof! Mama Petra, she talking!

346
00:34:32,343 --> 00:34:36,650
- Wiggin!
- Sir! Yes Sir! Andrew Wiggin reassigned.

347
00:34:36,651 --> 00:34:40,122
I asked for a replacement for O'Reilley
and this is what I get!

348
00:34:40,123 --> 00:34:43,928
A useless, skinny, untrained snot.

349
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:45,763
- I'm a quick study.
- Let me be clear!

350
00:34:45,764 --> 00:34:48,802
I intend to trade you A.S.A.P.

351
00:34:48,803 --> 00:34:52,440
My army is undefeated in the last 21 battles...

352
00:34:52,441 --> 00:34:55,812
...I might try to make it to
Command School within 6 months...

353
00:34:55,813 --> 00:34:58,482
...you can get your training
at someone else's expense.

354
00:34:58,483 --> 00:35:01,221
- He's all heart.
- Shut it, nica (???)!

355
00:35:01,222 --> 00:35:03,157
Watch your mouth, Mick!

356
00:35:04,191 --> 00:35:05,560
Here's the deal, snot...

357
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:10,434
...when we go into battle, you will not pass
through the gates until all my soldiers are through...

358
00:35:10,435 --> 00:35:17,144
...then, you will remain just inside the gates,
with your weapon undrawn and unfired till the game ends.

359
00:35:17,145 --> 00:35:20,015
- So I must do nothing?
- You're to keep out of the way!

360
00:35:20,016 --> 00:35:22,185
You bunk in the back of the room.

361
00:35:42,115 --> 00:35:44,786
You know, Bonzo
doesn't like to lose...

362
00:35:44,787 --> 00:35:48,291
...he doesn't want an untrained Launchy
screwing up his perfect maneuvers...

363
00:35:48,292 --> 00:35:52,698
...but the Battle Room is open 24/7. During
free time, I could show you some moves.

364
00:36:15,598 --> 00:36:17,100
Ready?

365
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:23,177
...3... 2... 1!

366
00:37:02,002 --> 00:37:03,470
Impressive!

367
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,707
Your turn.

368
00:37:13,352 --> 00:37:17,558
Hey, you can't just keep your thumb on the trigger.
You need half a second to recharge.

369
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:20,730
- At least you don't have any bad habits.
- I don't have any good ones, either.

370
00:37:20,731 --> 00:37:23,567
I'll give you those.

371
00:37:28,341 --> 00:37:29,343
Relax!

372
00:37:29,344 --> 00:37:32,313
Further your target, the longer
you have to hold the beam.

373
00:37:32,314 --> 00:37:33,782
Fire.

374
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:40,726
Leave it longer.

375
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:45,400
...it's the difference between a tenth and a half second
but in battle, that's a long time...

376
00:37:45,401 --> 00:37:48,938
Aim. Fire. Hold. Recharge.

377
00:37:49,773 --> 00:37:51,108
That's it!

378
00:37:51,642 --> 00:37:55,648
Learn where your trigger actually
fires and ride the edge.

379
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:58,019
Now you're getting it!

380
00:37:58,352 --> 00:37:59,204
3... 2... 1...
Go!

381
00:38:03,026 --> 00:38:06,064
- Let's see if you can beat me. Once! Just beat me once!
- Come on! You can do it!

382
00:38:09,269 --> 00:38:12,741
- That's five in a row! Who's the boss?
- You the boss Bonzo.

383
00:38:12,742 --> 00:38:16,379
That's right, I'm the boss.
Let's go again! I'm gonna make this six.

384
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,518
<i>- Ready? What you guys doing? C'mon
- Yeah, let's do it again sometime.</i>

385
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:21,154
That'd be swell.

386
00:38:25,727 --> 00:38:27,663
- Where were you?
- Practicing.

387
00:38:27,664 --> 00:38:30,367
- In free time.
- You don't practice with her.

388
00:38:30,735 --> 00:38:33,539
In fact, you don't practice at all!

389
00:38:35,775 --> 00:38:39,281
May I speak to you privately, sir?

390
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:47,793
Wiggin!

391
00:38:47,794 --> 00:38:51,499
<i>Hey, pednico (???),
don't you ever turn your back on me!</i>

392
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,469
If I'm gonna be useful in this toon,
I have to practice.

393
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,740
- You will do what I tell you!
- I will follow all commands you are authorized to give...

394
00:38:56,741 --> 00:39:00,580
...but if you take away my free time
I will get you iced.

395
00:39:04,151 --> 00:39:06,922
Are you threatening me, snot?

396
00:39:07,656 --> 00:39:08,407
No.

397
00:39:10,327 --> 00:39:13,532
Listen. I know you wanna trade me...

398
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:16,469
...but no one will take me
if I don't know anything.

399
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,840
Let me practice,
you can get rid of me sooner.

400
00:39:18,841 --> 00:39:20,209
I already gave you an order!

401
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:22,078
I know, in front of everybody...

402
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,415
...and you don't want your soldiers
to think that you backed down...

403
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:27,520
so for tonight you can say
that you won this argument...

404
00:39:27,521 --> 00:39:30,525
...then tomorrow you can tell
everybody that you changed your mind.

405
00:39:30,526 --> 00:39:34,163
You'll look generous. I'll get to train.
We both win. Deal?

406
00:39:35,031 --> 00:39:38,503
You better watch your back, Wiggin!

407
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,558
Wake up!

408
00:39:53,192 --> 00:39:56,930
<i>Wake up nis spendeblos (???)!
Battle with Leopards in 10 minutes!</i>

409
00:39:56,931 --> 00:39:59,067
- Hey! Wiggin!
- Yes Sir!

410
00:39:59,068 --> 00:40:00,302
- I changed my mind.

411
00:40:02,338 --> 00:40:09,082
- Maybe by watching my toons you'll learn
something and I can trade you easier.

412
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:11,920
Move.
Everybody, let's move!

413
00:40:11,921 --> 00:40:17,361
>Salamanders all-for-one< x2

414
00:40:17,362 --> 00:40:22,936
>There's no one like us under the sun!<x2

415
00:40:22,937 --> 00:40:28,678
>Salamanders! We're on top<x2

416
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:34,020
>When it comes to winning, we never stop!<x2

417
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,389
Salamander halt!

418
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,527
At ease.

419
00:40:38,993 --> 00:40:40,262
What's the play?

420
00:40:40,263 --> 00:40:46,271
Four winds - Toon A, up.
B, left. C, right. D, down.

421
00:40:46,272 --> 00:40:47,941
You! Wiggin.

422
00:40:47,942 --> 00:40:49,409
You hang back, near the gate.

423
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:53,114
- Bonzo, my toon will be a man short...
- He knows nothing about our formation, Stink...

424
00:40:53,115 --> 00:40:54,517
...He'll only get in the way.

425
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:57,388
You come out last.
Hang back and observe.

426
00:40:57,389 --> 00:40:59,558
We don't need you.

427
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:01,661
Step aside.

428
00:41:03,931 --> 00:41:10,508
Go Salamander!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

429
00:41:42,923 --> 00:41:47,530
We gotta break 'em up!
Fly - you lock us in...

430
00:41:47,531 --> 00:41:49,065
- Got it!
- Ready?

431
00:41:49,066 --> 00:41:51,569
- Ready!
- In... 3... 2... 1

432
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:11,399
- I'm hit!
- Shoot! Keep shooting, Petra!

433
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,436
- (???) Go!
- I'm on it!

434
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:31,329
<i>Stay behind me!</i>

435
00:42:35,468 --> 00:42:36,469
<i>We need cover!</i>

436
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,471
Wiggin!

437
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:41,043
What are you doing?
I told you to stay back!

438
00:42:48,054 --> 00:42:51,058
- You ok?
- What are you doing here? Bonzo will kill you!

439
00:42:51,059 --> 00:42:55,064
- Can't go back now.
- Well then get in the game. We're losing!

440
00:42:55,065 --> 00:42:57,668
They got half their toon
back through their gate.

441
00:42:57,669 --> 00:43:00,272
Put your feet to mine.
Redirect me.

442
00:43:00,273 --> 00:43:05,447
- Play dead. Don't draw your weapon,
till you know you're hot.(???)

443
00:43:05,448 --> 00:43:09,519
3... 2... 1..

444
00:44:21,394 --> 00:44:23,464
Smart move! Holding Wiggin back.

445
00:44:48,935 --> 00:44:50,571
Where'd you learn all this?

446
00:44:50,572 --> 00:44:54,343
- I had a brother.
- Had?

447
00:44:54,977 --> 00:44:59,151
Come on, let's go again.
But use your arms, not your hips.

448
00:44:59,584 --> 00:45:04,358
Officer on deck!
Ten-hut!

449
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,831
I thought I told you
not to train with her.

450
00:45:12,838 --> 00:45:16,777
It thought we'd agreed that
free time was free, sir.

451
00:45:17,445 --> 00:45:18,406
At ease.

452
00:45:22,018 --> 00:45:25,390
Stop it, Bonzo!

453
00:45:25,391 --> 00:45:29,729
Try making me look like a fool again
and I'll kill you.

454
00:45:39,444 --> 00:45:40,980
You ok?

455
00:45:42,115 --> 00:45:43,116
Yeah.

456
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:49,616
What do you want me to do?

457
00:46:54,791 --> 00:46:56,627
Valentine?

458
00:46:59,865 --> 00:47:02,836
How can you be in my game?

459
00:48:38,279 --> 00:48:40,683
Well done.
You're a killer now.

460
00:48:43,988 --> 00:48:48,194
Nightmares, Launchy?
Keep 'em to yourself!

461
00:48:48,862 --> 00:48:53,034
You said the game would reveal
his state of mind, not grow with it.

462
00:48:53,269 --> 00:48:56,507
How did his psycho
brother end up in the game?

463
00:48:56,508 --> 00:49:00,746
- He's obviously feeling some psychological pressure...
- Of course he's feeling pressure, Anderson...

464
00:49:00,747 --> 00:49:05,320
...This is a boot camp, for kids who
are gonna have to face a real enemy!

465
00:49:05,321 --> 00:49:10,861
The game is a thought relationship between the child
and the computer. Together they create stories...

466
00:49:10,862 --> 00:49:13,199
Then change the story.

467
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,203
This story's written by the child's
emotional reality. I can't change that!

468
00:49:16,204 --> 00:49:18,507
I don't know how these images
got into the game!

469
00:49:21,076 --> 00:49:23,747
Erase the game.

470
00:49:50,054 --> 00:49:51,890
You've done well.

471
00:49:53,425 --> 00:49:54,761
Very well.

472
00:49:54,762 --> 00:49:58,800
Top test scores in class.
Highest Battle Room ratings.

473
00:49:58,801 --> 00:50:01,771
But you have a habit of
upsetting your commander.

474
00:50:01,772 --> 00:50:05,410
I find it hard to respect someone
just because they outrank me, sir.

475
00:50:05,411 --> 00:50:08,515
- Puts you in a difficult position,
doesn't it?

476
00:50:08,516 --> 00:50:11,519
You don't like taking orders from Bonzo.

477
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,654
No, sir.

478
00:50:12,655 --> 00:50:16,827
Perhaps you'd prefer to give them yourself?

479
00:50:16,828 --> 00:50:22,302
- Sir?
- How'd you like to lead

480
00:50:22,303 --> 00:50:24,672
Sir, I've never heard of a Dragon army.

481
00:50:24,673 --> 00:50:28,111
We discontinued the name four years ago.

482
00:50:28,112 --> 00:50:30,848
No Dragon army ever won a battle.

483
00:50:30,849 --> 00:50:35,688
- Then why not a new name, sir?
- Because we already have the uniforms.

484
00:50:35,689 --> 00:50:37,691
And who will be in this army, sir?

485
00:50:37,692 --> 00:50:39,862
Misfits, like you...

486
00:50:39,863 --> 00:50:44,201
...oddballs, who might just be brilliant,
with the right commander.

487
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,743
Your new quarters.

488
00:50:58,256 --> 00:51:01,394
Your soldiers are being notified now.
You'll address them in 15 minutes.

489
00:51:04,532 --> 00:51:07,069
Do you think they'll follow me?

490
00:51:48,364 --> 00:51:52,904
Atten-hut!
Officer on deck.

491
00:51:54,073 --> 00:51:55,608
At ease.

492
00:51:55,609 --> 00:51:57,778
Welcome to Dragon army.

493
00:51:57,779 --> 00:52:00,916
Bunking will be arranged with youngest
at the front and veterans at the back.

494
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:07,460
- Ender, every other commander has their seniors closest to the door.
- Well, I don't intend to be like every other commander.

495
00:52:07,461 --> 00:52:10,197
What am I doing here Ender?
You don't even like me.

496
00:52:10,198 --> 00:52:12,300
I didn't select this army, Bernard...

497
00:52:12,301 --> 00:52:14,370
...but I intend to make it the best
at this school.

498
00:52:15,004 --> 00:52:17,942
I think you can help make that happen.

499
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:21,414
Am I wrong?

500
00:52:21,781 --> 00:52:23,617
No, sir!

501
00:52:23,618 --> 00:52:25,653
You'll respect one another.

502
00:52:25,654 --> 00:52:29,626
If anybody has an idea they think
is better than mine... I wanna hear it.

503
00:52:29,627 --> 00:52:33,199
I can't be expected to do all the
thinking in this army, can I, Bean?

504
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,300
No, sir!

505
00:52:34,301 --> 00:52:36,203
Then let's get suited up.

506
00:52:36,204 --> 00:52:39,073
- Training starts now!
- Sir! Yes, sir!

507
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:54,196
He's pushing them hard.
Might even make something of Bernard.

508
00:52:54,197 --> 00:52:57,368
Command School's pressing for a decision.

509
00:52:57,735 --> 00:53:00,906
Tell them we need more time!

510
00:53:01,407 --> 00:53:04,211
We're out of time.

511
00:53:04,212 --> 00:53:09,753
- Lieutenant! Tomorrow's game will commence at 0300.
- Yes Sir!

512
00:53:24,141 --> 00:53:28,347
Wake up! Wake up!
Battle with Salamander AND Leopard in five!

513
00:53:28,348 --> 00:53:31,486
Two armies at once!
The Colonel's changing the rules!

514
00:53:31,487 --> 00:53:35,525
In a battle with the Formics,
there will be no rules!

515
00:53:36,126 --> 00:53:37,261
You alright?

516
00:53:37,262 --> 00:53:38,930
I twisted my ankle.

517
00:53:38,931 --> 00:53:40,465
How bad?

518
00:53:40,466 --> 00:53:42,836
- Not good.
- Dink, get him to the infirmary.

519
00:53:42,837 --> 00:53:45,240
The rest of you!
Let's move! C'mon! We're late!

520
00:53:45,241 --> 00:53:46,241
C'mon!

521
00:53:57,325 --> 00:53:59,428
They already opened the gate?

522
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:19,825
- Petra?
- Two armies weren't enough? They had to block your view too?

523
00:54:19,826 --> 00:54:21,060
What are you doing here?

524
00:54:21,061 --> 00:54:25,200
Colonel said you needed a sub. Guess he thought
your odds were zero with me on the other team.

525
00:54:25,201 --> 00:54:29,907
- Bonzo agreed to this?
- Colonel Graff's orders!

526
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,110
Dink. Kneel.

527
00:54:32,111 --> 00:54:35,248
- What?
- I have an idea... Kneel.

528
00:54:37,485 --> 00:54:38,587
Ready?
... 3... 2... 1!

529
00:54:58,149 --> 00:55:00,252
- Whoa, whoa whoa! Look out!
- Aah!

530
00:55:00,253 --> 00:55:02,088
12 men on the wall!

531
00:55:02,089 --> 00:55:03,590
12 down, 20 to go.

532
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:08,164
They could be right behind these forward
stars, or all the way back at their gate.

533
00:55:10,535 --> 00:55:13,071
- Ready?
- Ready!

534
00:55:32,868 --> 00:55:34,120
Pull!

535
00:55:48,525 --> 00:55:52,130
The (???) have a bunch of stars around
their gate, like a giant doughnut..

536
00:55:52,131 --> 00:55:53,665
they're just hanging behind 'em.

537
00:55:53,666 --> 00:55:56,003
- No one closer?
- Nah.

538
00:55:56,004 --> 00:55:57,605
Nice.

539
00:55:57,606 --> 00:55:59,608
Let's see how they handle a formation.

540
00:55:59,609 --> 00:56:02,713
- We've never done a formation.
- Then they won't expect one.

541
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:11,359
We still outnumber him.

542
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:15,598
- We storm him and crush him.
- Neh! We hold our positions. He has to come to us!

543
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:16,700
We can't lose!

544
00:56:25,347 --> 00:56:27,616
Open fire!

545
00:56:30,521 --> 00:56:31,857
They're drifting outward!

546
00:56:31,858 --> 00:56:40,302
On my count, spoon 2 split (???)
from 1 - changing direction, 30 degrees

547
00:56:40,303 --> 00:56:43,240
Spoon four, spoon 6 (???)
Now!

548
00:56:43,241 --> 00:56:45,577
Spoon 5 (???) now!

549
00:56:53,923 --> 00:56:55,024
- I'm hit!
- Hold on, Alai!

550
00:56:55,025 --> 00:56:57,929
- (???) Are we there yet?
- Almost.

551
00:57:00,766 --> 00:57:02,102
Keep shooting!

552
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:09,579
We did it!

553
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:12,183
Eat that! Dragons rule!

554
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:15,823
Yeah!
Who's gonna beat us now?

555
00:57:15,824 --> 00:57:18,159
Still think he's not ready?

556
00:57:19,328 --> 00:57:20,896
Don't be smug.

557
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,742
I'm tired of you, Wiggin.

558
00:57:51,743 --> 00:57:56,950
You know, your father would be proud. Come to
fight a boy in the showers. With your buddies.

559
00:57:59,989 --> 00:58:02,626
Go watch the door.

560
00:58:02,627 --> 00:58:03,377
GO!

561
00:58:15,145 --> 00:58:16,213
Look.

562
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,684
You can say you won...

563
00:58:19,685 --> 00:58:21,254
...I'll say you taught me a lesson...

564
00:58:21,255 --> 00:58:22,656
No, coward!

565
00:58:22,657 --> 00:58:24,726
Raise your fists.

566
00:58:25,493 --> 00:58:27,831
Come on, fight!
C'mon!

567
00:58:27,832 --> 00:58:30,868
C'mon fight! C'mon!

568
00:58:39,381 --> 00:58:41,717
I could break your arm!

569
00:58:53,068 --> 00:58:53,910
Bonzo!?

570
00:58:56,607 --> 00:58:59,578
Bonzo! Bonzo!

571
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:03,617
Help!
We need help in here!

572
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:16,637
Everybody knows he started it.

573
00:59:20,342 --> 00:59:21,477
Ender...

574
00:59:21,478 --> 00:59:22,813
...I'm so sorry.

575
00:59:22,814 --> 00:59:24,649
Major!

576
00:59:27,153 --> 00:59:31,359
- We should never have allowed you to be alone...
- Not now, Major!

577
00:59:31,827 --> 00:59:34,564
Leave us!

578
00:59:40,673 --> 00:59:44,445
Leave him...
Now!

579
00:59:45,112 --> 00:59:47,750
You too, cadet.

580
01:00:08,114 --> 01:00:10,818
He's gonna die, isn't he?

581
01:00:12,153 --> 01:00:15,024
No. He's not.

582
01:00:15,792 --> 01:00:17,695
Please don't lie to me.

583
01:00:18,296 --> 01:00:23,704
We're gonna send him home,
back to Earth,

584
01:00:24,772 --> 01:00:27,743
- I want to go with him.
- We can't let you go.

585
01:00:28,177 --> 01:00:31,749
- You've come so far...
- And I wanna talk to my sister!

586
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:34,987
The fleet owns you, Ender.

587
01:00:35,488 --> 01:00:38,593
Strategos would never allow it.

588
01:00:38,594 --> 01:00:43,534
Send me home Colonel,
or I will resign.

589
01:00:44,435 --> 01:00:48,742
Don't threaten me, boy,
I'm not the enemy.

590
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:57,889
I'm not so sure.

591
01:01:01,126 --> 01:01:04,131
I won't play this game anymore!

592
01:01:06,535 --> 01:01:07,376
I quit!

593
01:01:10,975 --> 01:01:13,245
What are you gonna do?

594
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:17,151
Waste millions on a loser?

595
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:25,029
You wanted to see me.

596
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:31,038
You can't resign.
You have an obligation to stay here

597
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:35,278
My father trained horses. I've raised
yearlings since I was 5 years old.

598
01:01:35,279 --> 01:01:38,683
I know a thoroughbred when I see one.
We can't lose him!

599
01:01:38,684 --> 01:01:42,523
My God! You really don't see
them as children, do you?

600
01:01:42,524 --> 01:01:45,693
It used to be a war crime to recruit anyone under the age of 15!

601
01:01:45,694 --> 01:01:50,200
When the war is over,
we can have the luxury of debating the

602
01:01:50,201 --> 01:01:52,237
When it's over,
what will be left of the boy?

603
01:01:52,238 --> 01:01:54,507
What does it matter
if there's nothing left at all?

604
01:01:54,508 --> 01:01:57,711
We're using these children to win the war.

605
01:01:58,112 --> 01:02:03,687
And if they come home, it's my job to put them back together again.

606
01:02:10,464 --> 01:02:12,568
Thanks for what you've done.

607
01:02:50,658 --> 01:02:51,827
Where's Ender?

608
01:02:51,828 --> 01:02:56,667
- Hello Valentine.
- Why are you here? Did something happen?

609
01:02:56,668 --> 01:02:59,905
I need you to take a ride with me.

610
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:09,954
He's gonna be happy to see you.

611
01:03:09,955 --> 01:03:12,691
C'mon, you just want him to re-enlist.

612
01:03:12,692 --> 01:03:14,661
I want him to save lives.

613
01:03:14,662 --> 01:03:18,032
What about his life?

614
01:03:53,719 --> 01:03:56,389
Been sitting by Bonzo's bed...

615
01:03:56,690 --> 01:03:59,060
...waiting for him to recover...

616
01:04:00,062 --> 01:04:02,265
...he may never wake up.

617
01:04:02,266 --> 01:04:07,706
- Ender, he attacked first.
- And I fought back.

618
01:04:08,842 --> 01:04:11,746
I've had a lot of fights, Val.

619
01:04:11,747 --> 01:04:16,053
I've won because I 've always
understood what my enemy thinks.

620
01:04:16,054 --> 01:04:20,392
- But when I truly understand them...
- you also love them.

621
01:04:22,195 --> 01:04:27,770
I think it's impossible to truly understand
someone and not love them the way they love themselves.

622
01:04:27,771 --> 01:04:28,838
But in that moment...

623
01:04:28,839 --> 01:04:31,342
- You beat them.
- I destroy them!

624
01:04:31,776 --> 01:04:34,981
I make it impossible for them
to ever hurt me again.

625
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:42,025
Ender, they want me
to talk you into going back.

626
01:04:42,026 --> 01:04:47,834
- I told them I won't cooperate.
- I don't think you are hiding here just because you care about Bonzo.

627
01:04:47,835 --> 01:04:51,739
I think you're hiding because you're afraid.

628
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:54,076
Afraid you don't know your enemy...

629
01:04:54,077 --> 01:04:55,645
...afraid you might lose, but...

630
01:04:55,646 --> 01:04:59,384
...but what if you are the
next Mazer Rackham?

631
01:04:59,385 --> 01:05:01,955
You can't hide here forever.

632
01:05:03,490 --> 01:05:06,562
If you sit here...

633
01:05:06,895 --> 01:05:12,103
...if you don't try... we will all be lost.

634
01:05:21,885 --> 01:05:24,989
I'll miss you.

635
01:05:26,124 --> 01:05:29,028
I'll miss you too.

636
01:05:47,957 --> 01:05:52,363
I need to know that you will
not block my e-mails again.

637
01:05:55,869 --> 01:06:02,679
Attention! Prepare for transporter
docking operations!

638
01:06:03,915 --> 01:06:06,218
I thought we were going
back to Battle School?

639
01:06:06,219 --> 01:06:08,722
- We're not.
- Where are we going?

640
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:13,595
Much further.

641
01:06:21,006 --> 01:06:22,576
"Dear Valentine...

642
01:06:22,577 --> 01:06:26,749
...I must now travel to our advance command base near the Formics home planet

643
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:29,085
where I'll begin final training.

644
01:06:29,086 --> 01:06:32,290
If successful, I'll command
the entire invasion fleet.

645
01:06:32,991 --> 01:06:34,927
I wish there was another way...

646
01:06:34,928 --> 01:06:37,531
...but war seems inevitable.

647
01:06:37,532 --> 01:06:39,100
Stay safe.

648
01:06:39,101 --> 01:06:41,504
Love,
Ender."

649
01:07:55,648 --> 01:07:57,618
Not very hospitable, is it?

650
01:07:57,619 --> 01:08:02,092
We took it from the Formics,
27 years after Rackham's victory.

651
01:08:02,093 --> 01:08:06,164
Flushed them out of these tunnels
like rats from a sewer...

652
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:08,535
...drove them all the way back to their home planet.

653
01:08:08,536 --> 01:08:10,871
- How long did they live here?
- We're not sure...

654
01:08:10,872 --> 01:08:13,709
...this was a forward staging post
for their invasion of Earth.

655
01:08:13,710 --> 01:08:16,747
Built our base here to be
closer to their home planet

656
01:08:16,748 --> 01:08:21,086
to allow instantaneous communication
by ansible with our attack fleet.

657
01:08:21,087 --> 01:08:23,590
If they're on their home planet,
do we have them contained?

658
01:08:23,591 --> 01:08:27,530
- For now.
- If we have them boxed in,

659
01:08:27,531 --> 01:08:33,239
For the same reason that you kept kicking
that bully before I recruited you.

660
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:37,745
The purpose of this war
is to prevent all future wars.

661
01:08:37,746 --> 01:08:41,451
Your training begins first thing
tomorrow morning.

662
01:08:41,452 --> 01:08:44,922
Sergeant Dap will show you
to your quarters.

663
01:08:46,024 --> 01:08:48,294
Yes, sir!

664
01:08:57,241 --> 01:08:59,010
We're still reseeding the atmosphere...

665
01:08:59,011 --> 01:09:01,013
...it's breathable, but thin.

666
01:09:01,014 --> 01:09:04,185
In the event of an evacuation,
two breaths every minute from one of these

667
01:09:04,186 --> 01:09:06,955
will compensate for lower levels
of surface oxygen.

668
01:09:06,956 --> 01:09:09,159
Lights out in five.

669
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:22,302
Who are you?

670
01:10:26,174 --> 01:10:30,648
Look this may be amusing to you,
but they'll come looking for me!

671
01:10:33,986 --> 01:10:39,428
You want to fight me? Is that the test?
To see if I'll attack an old man?

672
01:10:39,429 --> 01:10:41,564
Well, I won't.

673
01:10:45,403 --> 01:10:49,008
I'll just sit this one out.

674
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:57,956
- Okay, you win.
- Since when do you tell the enemy when he's won?

675
01:10:57,957 --> 01:11:01,895
I surprised you once. Why didn't you
destroy me immediately after?

676
01:11:01,896 --> 01:11:05,400
- I thought you were a teacher!
- There is no teacher but the enemy.

677
01:11:05,401 --> 01:11:13,245
Enemy will tell you where you're weak,
where he's strong. From now on, I am your enemy, got it?

678
01:11:13,246 --> 01:11:14,446
Yes.

679
01:11:14,747 --> 01:11:16,116
Good.

680
01:11:22,826 --> 01:11:25,864
During training, I will devise
the strategy of your enemy.

681
01:11:25,865 --> 01:11:29,937
Remember he is stronger than you. From
now on, you are always about to lose.

682
01:11:33,342 --> 01:11:34,343
Sir.

683
01:11:36,914 --> 01:11:39,651
Do you have a name?

684
01:11:39,652 --> 01:11:42,489
Mazer Rackham!

685
01:11:43,056 --> 01:11:45,760
What? You thought I was dead?

686
01:11:46,328 --> 01:11:47,496
Sir...

687
01:11:48,197 --> 01:11:52,704
...I've been building models of your plane
since I was six years old.

688
01:11:53,505 --> 01:11:56,043
I have a question, sir.

689
01:11:56,044 --> 01:12:01,952
On the vids... they always cut out right
after you destroy the one carrier.

690
01:12:01,953 --> 01:12:02,953
Why?

691
01:12:04,489 --> 01:12:06,625
Get dressed.

692
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:13,836
Sir, I've already seen this.
I wanna know what happens after.

693
01:12:13,837 --> 01:12:16,406
Just watch.

694
01:12:31,662 --> 01:12:34,834
After the explosion cleared...

695
01:12:34,835 --> 01:12:40,510
...everything was incredibly still.

696
01:12:42,178 --> 01:12:44,849
Their ships just stopped shooting.

697
01:12:44,850 --> 01:12:48,254
Then they started falling out of the sky.

698
01:12:55,999 --> 01:12:57,668
Scroll back, please.

699
01:12:57,669 --> 01:13:00,172
To just after you lost your wingman.

700
01:13:03,878 --> 01:13:05,881
There. Play back, please.

701
01:13:09,619 --> 01:13:11,990
You took cover in the cloud...

702
01:13:12,724 --> 01:13:14,694
...you couldn't see anything...

703
01:13:14,695 --> 01:13:16,597
...so you must have been using your HUD.

704
01:13:16,598 --> 01:13:19,234
There! Stop!

705
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:24,976
You saw something.
What did you see in your HUD?

706
01:13:24,977 --> 01:13:27,313
Very good, Ender.

707
01:13:32,453 --> 01:13:35,592
Thermal imaging from the satellite.
The enemy is in red.

708
01:13:35,593 --> 01:13:37,495
What pattern do you see?

709
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:41,701
It seems random...
But it's not.

710
01:13:42,536 --> 01:13:44,271
There's an epicenter.

711
01:13:44,272 --> 01:13:45,473
There!

712
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:47,576
Really?

713
01:13:47,577 --> 01:13:50,781
You took out that one particular ship,
and the rest just...

714
01:13:50,782 --> 01:13:52,984
...gave up?

715
01:13:52,985 --> 01:13:53,986
Why?

716
01:13:57,758 --> 01:14:01,063
To what animals are the Formics most often compared?

717
01:14:01,064 --> 01:14:03,200
- Ants.
- Which have..?

718
01:14:03,667 --> 01:14:05,703
A queen...

719
01:14:05,704 --> 01:14:08,942
...who directs the worker ants.

720
01:14:10,077 --> 01:14:12,748
What she thinks, they do.

721
01:14:12,749 --> 01:14:14,617
Without her, they can't think for themselves...

722
01:14:14,618 --> 01:14:16,186
and they die!

723
01:14:16,187 --> 01:14:19,090
- You destroyed the Queen's ship...
- I must have, yes.

724
01:14:19,091 --> 01:14:21,928
- But you can't be certain?
- No.

725
01:14:21,929 --> 01:14:25,066
The Soviet(???) Hegemon insisted
we keep it classified.

726
01:14:25,067 --> 01:14:27,336
That's why they never
showed the rest of the battle.

727
01:14:27,337 --> 01:14:30,007
Or my face.

728
01:14:30,008 --> 01:14:31,910
To the world, I'm dead.

729
01:14:31,911 --> 01:14:33,745
Colonel.

730
01:14:34,246 --> 01:14:35,682
Your face?

731
01:14:35,683 --> 01:14:39,020
You mean why is it marked?

732
01:14:40,289 --> 01:14:43,260
My father was a Maori...

733
01:14:43,261 --> 01:14:45,998
... Lost him in the war.

734
01:14:45,999 --> 01:14:51,372
'Tä moko'...
is a way to connect to my past,

735
01:14:52,407 --> 01:14:55,979
It's a way for me to speak for the dead.

736
01:15:02,756 --> 01:15:03,724
Sir!

737
01:15:03,991 --> 01:15:06,495
- Have you ever seen a Queen?
- No. No one has.

738
01:15:06,496 --> 01:15:10,400
But if the Formics have rebuilt their
fleet, there must be more than one Queen.

739
01:15:10,401 --> 01:15:12,337
Yes, of course. (???)

740
01:15:12,338 --> 01:15:14,440
What happened when you attacked here?

741
01:15:15,074 --> 01:15:17,511
- Did you find one?
- No.

742
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:19,381
Why did they come?

743
01:15:19,382 --> 01:15:20,102
Water.

744
01:15:40,813 --> 01:15:43,016
Attention!

745
01:15:44,619 --> 01:15:46,121
Officer on deck.

746
01:15:46,122 --> 01:15:48,792
- Hey Bean.
- Ho Commander.

747
01:15:49,326 --> 01:15:50,160
Petra.

748
01:15:50,161 --> 01:15:53,465
We thought you were iced. We were
gonna have to have Dink take over...

749
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:55,202
That was never gonna happen.

750
01:15:56,003 --> 01:15:58,272
- Salaam, Alai.
- Salaam, Commander.

751
01:15:58,273 --> 01:16:00,342
- Bernard.
- Good to see you, sir.

752
01:16:00,943 --> 01:16:02,846
At ease.

753
01:16:02,847 --> 01:16:06,485
While you've been skinny-dipping,
the colonel's been flogging us to death on the simulator.

754
01:16:06,486 --> 01:16:08,522
Alright, take your seats.

755
01:16:08,523 --> 01:16:14,564
In a matter of weeks, we may be called on to fight
a real battle. Let's bring your commander up to speed.

756
01:16:15,866 --> 01:16:20,372
Our latest probe images will give you an idea
of what's happening on the enemy planet.

757
01:16:27,783 --> 01:16:32,691
Like us, they appear to have a
population growth rate that's unsustainable.

758
01:16:32,692 --> 01:16:36,864
For now, they're contained on their planet.
But time is not on our side.

759
01:16:37,265 --> 01:16:38,867
Where are they?

760
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:44,175
High surface temperatures limit their
above-ground activity to just a few hours a day.

761
01:16:45,109 --> 01:16:47,246
What's most alarming,...

762
01:16:47,247 --> 01:16:51,118
...is the rate at which their military power is expanding.

763
01:17:10,915 --> 01:17:13,585
But they've not yet moved against us?

764
01:17:13,586 --> 01:17:14,336
No.

765
01:17:17,826 --> 01:17:21,932
They're planning to colonize another planet,
before they breed themselves into extinction.

766
01:17:21,933 --> 01:17:25,337
Our orders are to defeat them before
they pose an irreversible threat.

767
01:17:25,871 --> 01:17:30,911
Their very existence is a threat.
Is that clear, Commander?

768
01:17:31,346 --> 01:17:34,083
- Clear, sir!
- Good.

769
01:17:34,084 --> 01:17:36,286
Carry on, Colonel!

770
01:17:38,289 --> 01:17:43,297
We will begin with fighter-real(???) simulations
that best approximate real battles.

771
01:17:43,298 --> 01:17:45,132
You will command overall strategy.

772
01:17:45,134 --> 01:17:48,705
Your toon leaders will each command a battle group.

773
01:17:49,306 --> 01:17:51,910
You will issue orders to them...

774
01:17:52,410 --> 01:17:56,517
...they will issue orders to their squadron to drone pilots.

775
01:18:29,533 --> 01:18:35,742
Finally, your entire fleet must support &
protect your most important asset...

776
01:18:36,777 --> 01:18:41,050
...$70 billion of pure destruction...

777
01:18:41,051 --> 01:18:43,554
...the MD-500...

778
01:18:43,555 --> 01:18:46,725
...which Petra is trained to fire.

779
01:18:46,726 --> 01:18:49,930
- MD?
- Molecular Detachment device..

780
01:18:49,931 --> 01:18:51,732
...we call her the 'Little Doctor'.

781
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:55,071
Particle beams accelerate
from her twin barrels...

782
01:18:55,072 --> 01:18:57,575
...At the focus point, they
reach critical effective mass.

783
01:18:57,576 --> 01:19:01,414
Chain reaction spreads outwards,
shattering molecular bonds.

784
01:19:01,415 --> 01:19:02,616
Leaves nothing standing.

785
01:19:02,617 --> 01:19:05,119
That's the beauty of the 'Little Doctor'.

786
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:08,357
No need to identify the
specific ship of the Queen...

787
01:19:08,358 --> 01:19:11,162
...the chain reaction takes
out the entire swarm.

788
01:19:11,696 --> 01:19:14,667
But I'll only get one shot.

789
01:19:14,668 --> 01:19:18,439
Once the Formics see how she works,
they won't come together again.

790
01:19:20,075 --> 01:19:24,248
You will have to win this
war, one battle at a time.

791
01:19:24,249 --> 01:19:31,492
Once our battle fleet is detected entering the Formic solar
system, we will have no alternative but to engage...

792
01:19:31,493 --> 01:19:33,662
...I trust we have chosen our Commander well.

793
01:19:33,663 --> 01:19:36,867
- There's greatness in him, sir.
- A killer instinct, too, I hope.

794
01:19:36,868 --> 01:19:38,870
Absolutely.

795
01:19:39,504 --> 01:19:44,278
Let's hope he's all you claim him to be.
We'll be with you soon.

796
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:45,447
Good night.

797
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:47,616
Good night, sir.

798
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:49,954
"Dear Valentine,...

799
01:19:49,955 --> 01:19:52,924
...So this is Command School.
I'm finally here.

800
01:19:52,925 --> 01:19:56,163
Being a Third, I've always been so afraid I might fail...

801
01:19:56,164 --> 01:19:57,866
...that I might not measure up...

802
01:19:57,867 --> 01:19:59,501
They made me a leader.

803
01:19:59,502 --> 01:20:03,407
And I promise you that I'll do
everything I can to win this war.

804
01:20:03,408 --> 01:20:07,079
I know if anything ever happened to you,
I would never forgive myself."

805
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:08,615
What are they doing?

806
01:20:08,616 --> 01:20:10,184
Harvesting water.

807
01:20:10,185 --> 01:20:11,953
If you're gonna use me,
I need to be closer.

808
01:20:11,954 --> 01:20:15,458
Too risky. Let's not reveal our best weapon
on what should be an easy attack.

809
01:20:15,459 --> 01:20:18,329
Alai, Bean!
Your droids peel away.

810
01:20:18,330 --> 01:20:20,933
Track them from below the ice
and read their path. (???)

811
01:20:26,174 --> 01:20:27,977
They're swarming.
They see us.

812
01:20:27,978 --> 01:20:33,452
Deploy all drones! Give me four
isobaric formations with 90 degree offsets!

813
01:20:41,932 --> 01:20:43,167
Open fire!

814
01:20:43,168 --> 01:20:50,210
Alai! On my count, fire directly up into the ice!
Good strategem. (???)

815
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:58,022
...3... 2... 1.
Now!

816
01:21:14,681 --> 01:21:20,022
As our training progresses, the simulations
are becoming more and more complex, and real.

817
01:21:20,023 --> 01:21:23,928
The pressure to win, day after day...
month after month...is intense.

818
01:21:23,929 --> 01:21:25,630
We get very little sleep...

819
01:21:25,631 --> 01:21:27,300
...somedays it's hard to keep up.

820
01:21:27,301 --> 01:21:29,303
- I got the breakaway!
- Great work, Bean.

821
01:21:29,304 --> 01:21:33,910
Squadrons 43 through 57, switch to
quadrant Foxtrot 3889!

822
01:21:33,911 --> 01:21:36,146
Ender, watch our right flank.
We need backup for Bernard.

823
01:21:36,147 --> 01:21:36,647
I see it!

824
01:21:36,648 --> 01:21:39,484
- Bernard, you flank them.
- Copy that. Using 10 through 18.

825
01:21:39,485 --> 01:21:41,321
Alai! To your right!

826
01:21:41,322 --> 01:21:45,227
Dink, compensate for the pull of
planet G8 and go full throttle!

827
01:21:45,228 --> 01:21:47,330
Bean, pop up and sync to 'Sierra'!(???)

828
01:21:47,331 --> 01:21:49,032
I could (???) 'Lima'!

829
01:21:49,033 --> 01:21:52,237
Do 'Sierra' NOW!
Bernard, watch your speed!

830
01:21:52,238 --> 01:21:54,440
Dink, you're closing too fast!

831
01:21:54,441 --> 01:21:56,777
- You said full throttle!
- PULL BACK NOW, DINK!

832
01:22:03,787 --> 01:22:05,690
Gahh!

833
01:22:19,979 --> 01:22:24,318
You can't absorb these kind of losses! War isn't
a game where you get to reboot and start over!

834
01:22:24,319 --> 01:22:27,089
Sir, I can't win if I don't take any risks.

835
01:22:27,090 --> 01:22:28,492
Nobody's saying not to take risks...

836
01:22:28,493 --> 01:22:30,695
...just don't try and control everything.

837
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:33,833
Bean improvised on the mop-ups,
you focus on the big picture.

838
01:22:33,834 --> 01:22:35,836
Delegate more to your teams.

839
01:22:35,837 --> 01:22:37,271
My teams are burned out...

840
01:22:37,272 --> 01:22:39,608
...how can they be effective
if they don't get any sleep?

841
01:22:39,609 --> 01:22:43,580
Sleep deprivation is part of your training.
A battle with the Formics could last for days!

842
01:22:43,581 --> 01:22:48,454
If I'd been smarter, I could have annihilated Petra's
Little Doctor while you were micro-managing Bean.

843
01:22:48,455 --> 01:22:49,589
That can't happen, understand?

844
01:22:50,558 --> 01:22:52,861
- Yes, sir.
- Do you?

845
01:22:53,329 --> 01:22:59,371
Cause I've trained others. Each one SO hopeful.
Each one ultimately a failure.

846
01:23:01,541 --> 01:23:05,413
Alright, Colonel.
He understands.

847
01:23:10,755 --> 01:23:13,725
- So I am not the first?
- No.

848
01:23:14,226 --> 01:23:17,131
But you will be the last.

849
01:23:17,765 --> 01:23:21,103
There is no time to train anyone else.

850
01:23:22,438 --> 01:23:27,146
So tomorrow Colonel Rackham
will run your final simulation.

851
01:23:27,746 --> 01:23:30,751
What if I win tomorrow? What happens?

852
01:23:30,752 --> 01:23:33,489
You'll be ready. To face the real enemy.

853
01:23:36,827 --> 01:23:40,933
And you'll be the finest commander
we've ever trained.

854
01:23:48,111 --> 01:23:51,182
One more simulation,
then I may have to go to war.

855
01:23:51,183 --> 01:23:57,057
What happens when it's no longer a game?
Real war is different. I still know nothing about my enemy.

856
01:23:57,491 --> 01:23:59,261
What if they could talk to us?

857
01:23:59,262 --> 01:24:04,869
- They can't. Dissections show no vocal cords.
- There are other ways to communicate.

858
01:24:06,505 --> 01:24:09,543
Ender, this is not a conversation
we should be having at 1 a.m.

859
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:13,549
What if they could 'think' to one another?

860
01:24:17,054 --> 01:24:18,723
What if we could 'think' to them?

861
01:24:18,724 --> 01:24:22,496
You need to sleep.
We've a graduation battle tomorrow.

862
01:24:25,233 --> 01:24:25,954
Right.

863
01:24:28,304 --> 01:24:32,243
- We're gonna get crushed.
- We won't get crushed. We have you.

864
01:24:32,244 --> 01:24:38,152
- Goodnight Petra.
- Goodnight Ender.

865
01:24:40,289 --> 01:24:42,526
You still think he's the one?

866
01:24:42,527 --> 01:24:48,935
We're committed. This boy has the
empathy to think like a Formic...

867
01:24:50,871 --> 01:24:55,378
...understand them, and anticipate them.

868
01:25:01,086 --> 01:25:03,991
He's not ready.

869
01:25:04,992 --> 01:25:07,897
We're never ready.

870
01:25:10,034 --> 01:25:12,838
You know when you're ready enough.

871
01:25:19,915 --> 01:25:24,255
Easy, sir!
It's Graduation Day.

872
01:25:33,469 --> 01:25:35,738
Good luck, sir!

873
01:25:42,015 --> 01:25:43,217
Attention!

874
01:25:47,423 --> 01:25:49,326
At ease!

875
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:50,961
Sir?

876
01:25:51,462 --> 01:25:53,866
We have an audience.

877
01:25:54,667 --> 01:25:56,336
Commander Wiggin!

878
01:25:57,004 --> 01:26:01,043
The Strategos is here today to
witness your final simulation.

879
01:26:01,044 --> 01:26:07,954
If you are successful, he will endorse your
promotion to Battle Commander of the entire fleet!

880
01:26:07,955 --> 01:26:08,722
Yes, sir!

881
01:26:08,723 --> 01:26:11,526
This simulation is based around
the enemy's home planet.

882
01:26:11,527 --> 01:26:14,396
Good luck, Commander.

883
01:26:14,397 --> 01:26:16,099
Thank you, sir.

884
01:26:19,738 --> 01:26:21,374
Stay calm.

885
01:26:22,175 --> 01:26:23,911
Shoot straight.

886
01:26:25,613 --> 01:26:28,585
Here we go.

887
01:27:05,273 --> 01:27:09,246
- They're waiting.
- Maybe they think we come in peace.

888
01:27:09,247 --> 01:27:12,851
I don't think Mazer intends for
us to find a diplomatic solution.

889
01:27:18,159 --> 01:27:21,364
What's he waiting for?

890
01:27:21,365 --> 01:27:24,602
Just give him a minute.

891
01:27:25,703 --> 01:27:27,907
Ender, what do we do?

892
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:33,515
Ender!

893
01:27:33,516 --> 01:27:38,289
The enemy's gate.. is down.

894
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:59,421
Petra, you're up.

895
01:27:59,422 --> 01:28:01,691
They're spread too wide
for a chain reaction.

896
01:28:01,692 --> 01:28:04,328
- She's right.
- Just let him follow his instinct.

897
01:28:04,329 --> 01:28:07,533
All Battle Groups, deploy
drones. Protect your carriers.

898
01:28:07,534 --> 01:28:10,871
Alai, you're Squadron Five!
Engage!

899
01:28:21,587 --> 01:28:23,557
This is suicidal!

900
01:28:39,248 --> 01:28:42,619
Oh crap! They're swarming.

901
01:28:44,956 --> 01:28:46,324
Close enough for you now, Petra?

902
01:28:46,325 --> 01:28:48,662
Once I fire, I need time to recharge.

903
01:28:49,229 --> 01:28:51,232
Understood!

904
01:28:51,233 --> 01:28:53,169
Go for the center.

905
01:28:54,671 --> 01:28:56,306
Fire now!

906
01:29:19,674 --> 01:29:23,147
- Whoo! She did it!
- Yeah.

907
01:29:30,991 --> 01:29:33,695
Give me full scalar (???)

908
01:29:41,607 --> 01:29:43,210
We're not done yet.

909
01:29:43,211 --> 01:29:46,014
- But we are so screwed!
- No, we're not.

910
01:29:46,015 --> 01:29:48,217
- Charged, Petra?
- No. I need 2 minutes.

911
01:29:48,218 --> 01:29:51,422
- All fighters fall back and surround her ship.
- Copy that.

912
01:29:51,957 --> 01:29:56,063
I want rings within rings, layers
upon layer, every fighter we have.

913
01:30:01,404 --> 01:30:07,112
- Ender, you're gonna leave our transporters defenseless!
- If we're gonna win this battle, Dink,

914
01:30:07,113 --> 01:30:11,452
When the outer layer is hit, the rest will continue
to drift with us like a shield. Do it now!

915
01:30:11,453 --> 01:30:14,123
He's abandoning his entire fleet!

916
01:30:14,124 --> 01:30:16,927
He's in command.
There's no stopping him now!

917
01:30:16,928 --> 01:30:19,832
90 seconds, Ender!

918
01:30:29,413 --> 01:30:32,283
No, no, no! I'm losing my carriers!

919
01:30:32,284 --> 01:30:33,752
My dreadnoughts are out!

920
01:30:33,753 --> 01:30:35,788
I don't care about dreadnoughts!

921
01:30:35,789 --> 01:30:39,361
Just protect Petra!
Like we protected Alai when we fought Bonzo!

922
01:30:39,362 --> 01:30:40,496
I hope you know what you're doing.

923
01:30:40,497 --> 01:30:43,835
- Ready, Petra?
- 60 seconds! What am I aiming for?

924
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:49,409
The planet.

925
01:30:49,410 --> 01:30:50,444
What?

926
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:55,285
We destroy the planet,
we destroy the queens.

927
01:30:55,286 --> 01:30:56,286
Game Over.

928
01:30:56,287 --> 01:30:59,123
Ender, my targeting sensor needs a clear line of sight!

929
01:30:59,124 --> 01:31:00,760
We will clear a path.

930
01:31:00,761 --> 01:31:05,433
All fighters maintain a clockwise rotation.
Focus all firepower forward.

931
01:31:15,515 --> 01:31:18,620
- Ender, we're entering the atmosphere!
- We need to slow down!

932
01:31:18,621 --> 01:31:20,122
We can't! We're one unit now!

933
01:31:20,123 --> 01:31:22,826
We're not equipped to handle the heat
of passing through an atmosphere!

934
01:31:22,827 --> 01:31:27,633
Our drones are our heat shield!
Keep falling. Let gravity do the work!

935
01:31:38,316 --> 01:31:40,553
This shield won't hold forever!

936
01:31:40,554 --> 01:31:42,455
We don't NEED forever!

937
01:31:43,557 --> 01:31:46,529
30 seconds!
I still don't have a clear shot.

938
01:31:46,530 --> 01:31:47,396
We're burning up!

939
01:31:47,397 --> 01:31:52,403
Bean, on my count, accelerate the fighters from
the nose of the formation in a continuous stream.

940
01:31:52,404 --> 01:31:56,243
- Yes, sir!
- Like bullets from a rifle,

941
01:31:56,244 --> 01:31:58,246
We will drill a hole through the swarm.

942
01:31:58,247 --> 01:32:00,883
- Petra, you'll only get a second.
- That's all I need.

943
01:32:00,884 --> 01:32:05,056
... 3... 2... 1
Now, Bean!

944
01:32:24,285 --> 01:32:28,925
Shields have reached at 5%! (???)

945
01:32:28,926 --> 01:32:30,160
Now, Petra!
Now!

946
01:32:30,161 --> 01:32:32,631
- 10 seconds!
- They've broken the shield!

947
01:32:34,767 --> 01:32:37,305
Fire Petra!
We're out of time!

948
01:33:20,670 --> 01:33:23,574
We did it!

949
01:33:34,323 --> 01:33:36,694
How about that?

950
01:33:40,032 --> 01:33:42,536
Game over!

951
01:33:50,615 --> 01:33:53,752
What's he saying?

952
01:33:54,987 --> 01:33:58,927
Restoring the ansible connection.

953
01:34:33,913 --> 01:34:36,083
What is this?

954
01:34:37,084 --> 01:34:40,490
Why are we watching these images?

955
01:34:48,502 --> 01:34:49,223
Ender.

956
01:34:51,439 --> 01:34:53,542
Thank you!

957
01:34:53,543 --> 01:34:58,116
Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant!
Thank God for you, son!

958
01:34:58,517 --> 01:35:01,687
Why are these images
in the program?

959
01:35:01,688 --> 01:35:03,357
Ender...

960
01:35:03,358 --> 01:35:06,028
...we won!

961
01:35:07,363 --> 01:35:09,699
What do you mean, 'we won'?

962
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:12,671
I beat him!!

963
01:35:12,672 --> 01:35:16,209
He runs the simulations!
He said it was a game!

964
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:20,716
It was them or us, Ender.
There was no other way.

965
01:35:21,451 --> 01:35:24,221
With this victory...

966
01:35:24,222 --> 01:35:26,992
...you've won all future battles.

967
01:35:26,993 --> 01:35:32,601
You destroyed them...for all of us!

968
01:35:54,701 --> 01:35:58,540
<i>- Stand down.
- Move! Move! Please! Move!</i>

969
01:36:03,714 --> 01:36:05,683
- Ender...
- STAY AWAY FROM ME!

970
01:36:05,684 --> 01:36:06,785
You lied!

971
01:36:06,786 --> 01:36:10,525
- Son, we were afraid if we told you, you'd..
- What? Refuse to play?

972
01:36:10,526 --> 01:36:13,329
- They attacked us 1st... (???)
- NO! They waited!

973
01:36:13,330 --> 01:36:16,233
- What were they waiting for?
- Who.. CARES?!

974
01:36:16,234 --> 01:36:19,338
We lost a thousand men on the
transporters you abandoned.

975
01:36:19,339 --> 01:36:21,241
I abandoned them in order to win!

976
01:36:21,242 --> 01:36:27,250
- YES!.. And they died proudly for US!
- They might not have died at all!

977
01:36:33,525 --> 01:36:36,664
- If I'd known it was real, I would've...
- What? Called for a dialogue?

978
01:36:36,665 --> 01:36:39,134
- They can't even speak.
- ...watched them!

979
01:36:39,135 --> 01:36:43,073
What were they thinking? Were they building an army for a second invasion?

980
01:36:43,074 --> 01:36:47,079
- Or..or simply preparing to defend themselves...
- Ender, stop. -...from us!

981
01:36:48,748 --> 01:36:53,289
They came to Earth to establish a colony.
We chased them away.

982
01:36:53,290 --> 01:36:56,426
<i>- And in fifty years, they never returned!
- It makes no difference now.</i>

983
01:36:56,427 --> 01:36:59,331
I will bear the shame
of this genocide, forever!

984
01:36:59,332 --> 01:37:05,039
- No! You will be remembered as a hero.
- I WILL BE REMEMBERED AS A KILLER!

985
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:09,213
- It was us or them.
- And you're sure we've killed every last one of them?

986
01:37:09,214 --> 01:37:10,881
I saw their whole planet destroyed.

987
01:37:10,882 --> 01:37:14,020
How do you know there isn't another
colony or another Queen out there?

988
01:37:14,021 --> 01:37:18,893
- (???)We WON! That's all that matters.
- No!

989
01:37:20,395 --> 01:37:23,935
The way, we win, matters.

990
01:37:31,446 --> 01:37:33,515
Don't hurt him.

991
01:37:56,850 --> 01:37:59,454
- Go on. You need to let him rest.
- Can I stay with him?

992
01:38:02,826 --> 01:38:04,462
Just so he's not alone...

993
01:38:04,463 --> 01:38:05,931
Please...

994
01:38:07,133 --> 01:38:11,005
Yes, of course...

995
01:38:23,157 --> 01:38:27,563
C'mon! Let's let him rest.

996
01:38:43,354 --> 01:38:46,725
...What if they could talk to us...

997
01:38:49,964 --> 01:38:53,034
...what were they thinking...

998
01:38:57,909 --> 01:39:00,112
Valentine!

999
01:39:04,251 --> 01:39:06,822
...What if we could think to them...

1000
01:39:11,462 --> 01:39:14,333
- Valentine!
- Ender!

1001
01:39:14,334 --> 01:39:16,369
Ender, wait!

1002
01:39:16,370 --> 01:39:17,090
Ender!

1003
01:39:18,372 --> 01:39:21,344
What are you doing, Ender?

1004
01:39:21,345 --> 01:39:24,582
- I know what she wants!
- Ender?

1005
01:39:24,583 --> 01:39:27,753
<i>#Warning! You are leaving an oxygen - balanced environment!(???) #</i>

1006
01:39:27,754 --> 01:39:31,226
Ender, stop!

1007
01:39:31,227 --> 01:39:34,997
It's not safe!
Ender!

1008
01:39:41,274 --> 01:39:44,245
Breathe. Just breathe.

1009
01:39:54,260 --> 01:39:58,833
In my game, I saw this place.

1010
01:39:58,834 --> 01:40:00,269
What are you talking about?

1011
01:40:00,270 --> 01:40:03,841
The Formics accessed the game through me.

1012
01:40:03,842 --> 01:40:07,646
Their thoughts, my dreams,
all mixed together.

1013
01:40:10,751 --> 01:40:14,356
They were trying to communicate.

1014
01:40:14,657 --> 01:40:16,694
What are you doing?

1015
01:40:18,429 --> 01:40:19,999
Go back.

1016
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:21,701
No!

1017
01:40:21,702 --> 01:40:25,507
Please!
I have to do this.

1018
01:40:58,957 --> 01:41:00,392
"Dear Valentine,

1019
01:41:00,926 --> 01:41:04,065
...I now know my dreams
were never my own.

1020
01:41:04,066 --> 01:41:06,234
They came from her.

1021
01:41:06,235 --> 01:41:08,972
She was always trying
to communicate with me.

1022
01:41:09,539 --> 01:41:12,410
I know the Formics
better than any living soul.

1023
01:41:12,978 --> 01:41:16,316
I stole their future from them.

1024
01:41:16,317 --> 01:41:20,022
Now I must find a way to make amends."

1025
01:43:54,286 --> 01:43:56,356
You're dying.

1026
01:44:12,514 --> 01:44:15,785
Is it a Queen?

1027
01:44:36,083 --> 01:44:40,823
I'll find her a new home.

1028
01:44:45,363 --> 01:44:48,134
I promise.

1029
01:45:01,587 --> 01:45:03,891
"I miss you, Valentine.

1030
01:45:04,425 --> 01:45:07,330
You won't be hearing from me for a while.

1031
01:45:14,206 --> 01:45:18,913
I need to find out if I'm
as gifted at peace as I am at war.

1032
01:45:20,049 --> 01:45:24,221
They've rewarded me the rank of Admiral
and left me to my own devices...

1033
01:45:24,222 --> 01:45:26,459
...which suits me fine.

1034
01:45:26,792 --> 01:45:30,798
I'll travel the universe and
carry with me, a precious cargo.

1035
01:45:31,466 --> 01:45:34,537
Because I have a promise to keep."
