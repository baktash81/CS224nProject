- This is my town, remember?

219
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:36,339
- Have a seat, can we get you something? Cappuccino?
- What are you doing here, Dave?

220
00:29:36,427 --> 00:29:39,843
- We clean our own house.
- This is bigger than your house, John.

221
00:29:39,927 --> 00:29:45,239
You think I fly here and pull the string
so conducted this operation if it wasn't?

222
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:50,208
Alright well, and how about you clue me in...

223
00:29:50,295 --> 00:29:52,693
and said you own me at least that much!

224
00:29:52,781 --> 00:29:56,156
Yeah, now I'd take coffee, black, thank you!

225
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,964
Okay, John!

226
00:30:05,052 --> 00:30:10,697
We'd been investigating people receiving
financial tip via text in SMS.

227
00:30:10,784 --> 00:30:15,369
The recipients of all have been American,
other than that fixing random.

228
00:30:15,457 --> 00:30:19,343
The first was an executive expurgator, a major quid bureau.

229
00:30:19,427 --> 00:30:21,786
Next the realtor!

230
00:30:21,979 --> 00:30:26,140
They both receive tips to buy stocks, the stocks went up!

231
00:30:26,227 --> 00:30:28,744
Once a perosn gets hooked on making easy money...

232
00:30:28,832 --> 00:30:31,536
we think they start receiving instructions...

233
00:30:31,718 --> 00:30:37,239
last week we find another...
an IT Administrate at the Department of Defense.

234
00:30:38,076 --> 00:30:43,625
She makes a million dollars buying stocks before
co-worker knows that she was receiving unusual text messages!

235
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:49,915
And one night, she received the messages...and
shuts down the firewalls to the Pentagon servers.

236
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,780
Who's sending the messages?

237
00:30:51,864 --> 00:30:55,313
The sender's field on the text is always blank and untraceable.

238
00:30:55,401 --> 00:30:59,322
- Okay, did you interrogant the recipients?
- I would...!

239
00:31:00,213 --> 00:31:02,885
but they're all dead!

240
00:31:10,651 --> 00:31:12,505
Now you see why this guy is so important!

241
00:31:12,593 --> 00:31:14,633
You get tip to the woman, how did you find Peterson?

242
00:31:14,718 --> 00:31:19,927
We intersect this similar text in Bangkok,
ID him, show his sudden ticket to Prague!

243
00:31:20,015 --> 00:31:23,766
- I hoop into a next flight.
- Doesn't sound like FBI's technology?

244
00:31:23,854 --> 00:31:29,239
- I'm co-ordinating with Burke and NSA on this.
- Oh, Mr., total informations when it's up?

245
00:31:29,327 --> 00:31:32,363
Yeah, it shouldn't break that to the DOD incidents.

246
00:31:32,447 --> 00:31:37,770
They can trace the text with Mr. Peterson plays ball,
can I count on your help?

247
00:31:42,612 --> 00:31:47,047
- You have a good nap, sunshine?
- You're alright?!

248
00:31:48,567 --> 00:31:52,526
Option one, you can help us nail these bastards...

249
00:31:52,612 --> 00:31:56,099
Option two, you can go to prison for fraud.

250
00:31:56,296 --> 00:32:01,750
- So what would you be, one or two?
- Oh gee...let me think!

251
00:32:02,932 --> 00:32:08,041
- Good!
- Come on, let's me bring you right back to the hotel!

I'm sorry, Mr. Muller, I haven't get anything for you yet!

270

A man walks into my casino and nothing more than a foul...
and walks out with 3 million Euros...

271

If my casino is vulnerable, what about my banks?
what about my commodity operations?

272
00:34:12,955 --> 00:34:18,495
I need to know that some fool with
a foul can't bring down a multi-billion empire!

- I am sorry?

276
00:34:32,022 --> 00:34:33,835
Archery!

277
00:34:34,321 --> 00:34:37,273
I was quite an archery when I was young,
I was passionated about it.

278
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,004
Use to make my own arrows!

279
00:34:39,092 --> 00:34:43,468
Do you know the secret of making
an arrow that would fly to the tuck?

280
00:34:44,438 --> 00:34:49,061
You need strong feathers, so I bought myself a falcon.

281
00:34:49,145 --> 00:34:52,322
Call him 'Apollo' after the goddam archery!

282
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:57,870
Mildly creature, beautiful, proud...magnificent feathers...

283
00:34:59,826 --> 00:35:04,485
Yes, and one day, Apollo was flying
the grounds here, flying freely!

284
00:35:04,571 --> 00:35:11,125
I was watching him, admiring him,
and pick up my bow and shot him...

285
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:14,762
straight through the heart,
died instantly!

286
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:20,273
Do you know why I did that, John?

287
00:35:20,361 --> 00:35:22,446
To remind myself...

288
00:35:22,572 --> 00:35:25,665
It's the seemingly, harmless traces we leave behind...

289
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:29,387
and later can be used to destroy us!

290
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:34,550

Oh...I don't know, they are reliable,
they're always follow the programming.

- What is it, post people?
- Well, yeah!

332
00:39:45,663 --> 00:39:46,906
Second text.

333
00:39:46,992 --> 00:39:49,854
- Sending SMS messages...
- Locked, and tracking SMS messages...

334
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,770
System is finding source origin...

335
00:39:51,855 --> 00:39:55,918
- Messages are coming from inside US territory, sir!
- One more.

336
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:59,079
Bet, sir?

337

<i>That was your only warning,
no more interference.</i>

<i>Turing the phone off again,

341
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,684
- We get them!
- All logout!

342
00:41:10,864 --> 00:41:12,947
- Tranquilization completed.
- Call them and say come in!

343
00:41:13,032 --> 00:41:17,042
- We're finding co-ordinates...
- Latitude North which in 42 and East 29.

00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:26,763
- Tracking and finding final co-ordinates...
- North, 38 hours 57 minutes.

346
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:28,687
Shut it down!

347
00:41:28,835 --> 00:41:32,273
All tracking system off, now!

348
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:40,680
- Abort, I say again, abort!
- Yes, sir.

349
00:41:41,003 --> 00:41:43,464
<i>Source is Echelon.</i>

350
00:41:45,809 --> 00:41:49,500
- We have an abort, pull them off now!
- Woo...woo...what do you mean abort?

351
00:41:49,584 --> 00:41:52,072
<i>Ture the phone off again-
I'LL KILL YOU.</i>

352
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,750
- Let's go, Peterson.
- Hey, don't turn off the phone!

353
00:41:56,836 --> 00:41:58,699
Come on.

354
00:41:59,521 --> 00:42:01,938
This is bullshit, what am I suppose to tell my boss?

355
00:42:02,024 --> 00:42:03,923
I don't care, them him it's classfied.

356
00:42:04,009 --> 00:42:09,756
- Classfied, that's not gonna satisfied him.
- Well, it goes to your job, again!

357
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:16,729
- What's going on?
- The investigation has been terminated.

358
00:42:18,003 --> 00:42:20,718
It's about Echelon, isn't it?

359
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:26,822
You always have a big month, you should keep it shut!

360
00:42:27,486 --> 00:42:29,909
Both of you!

361
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:41,791
- What's Echelon?
- It's NSA central computer, filter off all global communication!

362
00:42:43,074 --> 00:42:47,491
We'd been sold, we'd been seeing messages,
it's using me and NSA?

363
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:49,623
Exactly.

364
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:54,253
Alright, Echelon's been compromised.
Find out what's the hell going on.

365
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:56,891
I don't show any unauthorised data access.

366
00:42:56,977 --> 00:42:59,898
Somebody get in, I need to know
how they did it, and who it was...

367
00:42:59,986 --> 00:43:04,086
Well, I can monitor the input if someone is
remotely manipulating, we'll see in real time.

368
00:43:04,177 --> 00:43:06,305
- Do it!
- It's gonna take us some time if we figure...

369
00:43:06,393 --> 00:43:08,918
Just do it now!

370
00:43:09,697 --> 00:43:13,783
<i>Prague, Czech Republic.</i>

371
00:43:20,044 --> 00:43:21,805
Well?

372
00:43:22,278 --> 00:43:25,951
Echelon is dracula, can access any
security system on the planet!

373
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:29,559
I know what's Echelon capable of,
I need to know who can hack into it.

374
00:43:29,645 --> 00:43:31,926
Well, someone with some serious know how...

375
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:36,929
my guess is...foreign power or may be even an insider!

376
00:43:37,346 --> 00:43:40,789
- What're their NSA's plans?
- We've get to keep a lead on this thing now...

377
00:43:40,875 --> 00:43:45,875
they get the phone, so they're trying to
trace the messages without Peterson!

378
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,569
You said there were others who receives messages...

379
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:53,377
Yes, but the...it looks like it seems random...

380
00:43:53,465 --> 00:43:56,489
Nothing's random!

381
00:43:58,416 --> 00:44:02,627
Track Peterson, he leads us to who's doing this!

382
00:44:02,715 --> 00:44:07,961
- What makes you think so certain about this person aldready?
- Because he hasn't dead yet!

383
00:44:10,896 --> 00:44:13,221
You said the NSA is not gonna tolerate any outside investigation...

384
00:44:13,309 --> 00:44:19,081
John, just keep him alive,
otherwise your're not worth the NSA to deal with!

385
00:44:21,051 --> 00:44:24,903
<i>- Who is it?
- Navy Seals, sir. We can handle themselves!</i>

386
00:44:24,989 --> 00:44:28,041
<i>- Not exactly, his twin!
- We'll do.</i>

387
00:44:28,126 --> 00:44:31,440
<i>There's a line aside we're doubt it'll be from a distance.</i>

388
00:44:31,528 --> 00:44:35,105
<i>What about Reed and Peterson?
Did they know?</i>

389
00:44:35,229 --> 00:44:38,607
- They will stay quiet, sir.
- Reed I trust, Peterson I doubt.

390
00:44:38,695 --> 00:44:42,752
<i>He's still scare to be a threat, I guarantee it!</i>

391
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:50,363
We are ready here, sir.

392
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:56,435
<i>Forgive me for asking, but are you sure
you don't want to use Peterson on this?</i>

393
00:44:56,572 --> 00:45:01,448
<i>Grant, you have your orders, now follow them!</i>

394
00:45:08,721 --> 00:45:13,650
<i>- Waiting for the order on Peterson, sir!
- Procced!</i>

395
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,555
- Whoo, this was...excellent and amazying!
- Thank you!

396
00:45:20,625 --> 00:45:24,011
- Oh...oh...let me help you...
- No, stay here...

397
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:34,032
- You take these photographs yourself?
- Yeah, you like them?

398
00:45:34,033 --> 00:45:35,814
Yeah, yeah, they're beautiful!

399
00:45:35,958 --> 00:45:39,148
That's always been my dream to live in Paris.

400
00:45:39,585 --> 00:45:43,316
- Woo, what's stopping you?
- Um...reality.

401
00:45:43,318 --> 00:45:46,139
It's not always look like the way you dreams.

402
00:45:46,215 --> 00:45:50,788
- Ah...I can't say...
- Come on, Max, you must talk something!

403
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:59,959
I guess...um...ah...all I really want this to be useful...

404
00:46:07,216 --> 00:46:12,513
And just once...you know...make a real difference.

405
00:46:13,294 --> 00:46:15,785
You'll get your chance!

406
00:46:28,803 --> 00:46:31,008
Ah...never been!

407
00:46:31,105 --> 00:46:36,569
Ou...you're missing out, everyone
has to disappear at least once!

408
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:41,145
- What's so special, then?
- Harder to describe, really!

409
00:46:42,672 --> 00:46:44,721
Tell me.

410
00:46:45,885 --> 00:46:50,413
It is...ah...the way the street look...

411
00:46:50,414 --> 00:46:54,437
and the life that people endears...

412
00:46:54,438 --> 00:46:57,070
and the rain...

413
00:46:57,281 --> 00:47:00,571
the way it takes into eye's direction...

414
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:03,686
makes everything a painting...

415
00:47:03,812 --> 00:47:08,070
And it just...

416
00:47:53,906 --> 00:47:57,142
- Yeah.
- Is he still there?

417
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:04,602
- Yeah!
- Good, keep him there. I'm on my way.

418
00:48:04,603 --> 00:48:06,652
- And Kamila?
- Yeah.

419
00:48:06,653 --> 00:48:09,444
Keep prepare for everything.

420
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:14,102
1 and a 4...could be...hm...

421
00:48:14,323 --> 00:48:17,166
Have fun, my ass!

422
00:48:20,206 --> 00:48:23,236
- Anything?
- Nothing.

423
00:48:27,461 --> 00:48:30,668
10 AM Kaprova & Kriz....

424
00:48:30,669 --> 00:48:32,669
- Krizovnicka.
- Come on, let's move it!

425
00:48:32,669 --> 00:48:36,815
Target seem this one is active,
system is finding co-ordinates.

426
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,981
Transit trunk now bubble 4 is active!

427
00:49:02,552 --> 00:49:05,354
Status...cannel 7 is active.
Negative logout.

428
00:49:05,455 --> 00:49:08,981
Intercept tracer active.
Negative block.

429
00:49:18,811 --> 00:49:21,662
<i>CROSS NOW.</i>

430
00:49:23,021 --> 00:49:27,627
- It seems target just active.
- The data stream is hacking.

431
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,677
Morning!

432
00:50:21,995 --> 00:50:25,308
- Whoa...you look beautiful.
- Hmm...

433
00:50:26,399 --> 00:50:28,597
- Ah...I hope you don't mind...
- No, not at all.

434
00:50:28,699 --> 00:50:33,253
- What are you reading?
- A little background on Echelon.

435
00:50:33,916 --> 00:50:35,986
NSA's filtering computer.

436
00:50:35,987 --> 00:50:40,729
Did you know that the NSA intercepts every
phone call we make, every e-mail and every text?

437
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:44,966
- You just said you assume that.
- Yeah, well, that was just exist now.

438
00:50:44,967 --> 00:50:48,664
The upgrade that fail, we'll put a
camera in every person's home.

439
00:50:48,781 --> 00:50:53,677
- Ha...okay...now you just sound paranoid.
- No, NSA actually admits it.

440
00:50:53,766 --> 00:50:55,460
Look, come on.

441
00:50:55,461 --> 00:51:00,202
See the upgrade would decentralise Echelon
to operate in every computer on the net.

442
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:03,207
This...would be Echelon.

443
00:51:03,208 --> 00:51:06,739
No matter what you download, reading or
what you type, watching you on your webcam.

444
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:09,892
- Jesus!
- Yeah...I wish there would be no stopping it...

445
00:51:09,893 --> 00:51:14,263
- unless you turn off all the computers in the world!
- A global police's sack!

446
00:51:14,264 --> 00:51:18,602
Exactly, and this only fail by one vote!

447
00:51:19,478 --> 00:51:23,799
I bet the vote work back in Omaha!

448
00:51:27,444 --> 00:51:29,564
What?

449
00:51:30,935 --> 00:51:34,089
I never said it was from Omaha.

450
00:51:38,231 --> 00:51:40,792
So how'd you know that?

451
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:48,322
Kamila, look at me!

452
00:51:55,236 --> 00:51:58,125
Then how do you work for?

453
00:52:04,451 --> 00:52:06,773
Get down!

454
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:09,584
Stay!

455
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:11,872
Now!

456
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:31,164
Bathroom!

457
00:52:32,771 --> 00:52:35,657
- Stay down.
- Ok?

458
00:52:41,147 --> 00:52:43,479
He's with the girl.

459
00:52:44,278 --> 00:52:46,639
Get in the back.

460
00:56:19,594 --> 00:56:21,792
Are you alright?

461
00:56:22,062 --> 00:56:25,841
Get him out of here. I'll be fine.

462
00:56:29,059 --> 00:56:31,250
Come on.

463
00:56:37,666 --> 00:56:39,937
Just go!

464
00:56:49,245 --> 00:56:51,243
Sir?

465
00:56:51,309 --> 00:56:54,205
- Give me some good news.
- I'm sorry, sir!

466
00:56:54,206 --> 00:56:59,225
We monitor every streams...but someone's
getting in and I honestly don't know how!

467
00:57:08,528 --> 00:57:12,700
<i>- Yeah?
- I'm afraid I had some bad news, sir!
Peterson get away!</i>

468
00:57:12,701 --> 00:57:15,353
<i>- What?
- It was a girl, she kills two of my men!</i>

469
00:57:15,354 --> 00:57:19,139
Stupid, son of the bitches!

470
00:57:30,257 --> 00:57:34,979
<i>I see you. I want Max or you die, Agent Grant.</i>

471
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:57,303
Are you alright?

472
00:57:57,304 --> 00:58:01,049
I told you not to turn off the phone, it says it's gonna kill me!

473
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:05,187
It wasn't them, alright...it's NSA.

474
00:58:05,269 --> 00:58:07,549
What do we do? Do we hide?

475
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:12,443
Hide? You don't hide from these guys.
All we get to do is to figure out who's behind this...

476
00:58:12,444 --> 00:58:15,364
and let's see if NSA would cut a deal.

477
00:58:15,476 --> 00:58:19,868
- How we suppose to do that?
- That...that I don't know.

478
00:58:24,035 --> 00:58:27,571
- Yuri...
- Woo...the cabie with the ear-piece?

479
00:58:27,572 --> 00:58:31,729
Yeah...he said with my SIM he can
find out who's sending messages.

480
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:34,426
Look, I think this is a little bit out of his league.

481
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:37,602
Besides he's already skip down...
hoop on a plane back to Moscow.

482
00:58:37,707 --> 00:58:40,805
- Oh I'll call.
- Hey, you're not calling anybody, alright!

483
00:58:40,806 --> 00:58:43,188
One call, we'll gonna pop up on the grid.

484
00:58:43,189 --> 00:58:46,708
- Fine, so we go to Moscow.
- Oh...just like that, being you, just go to Moscow.

485
00:58:46,709 --> 00:58:50,227
Oh...you get a better idea? Split it out!

486
00:58:51,684 --> 00:58:55,154
- I'll go myself, let me help!
- Look, you would not be alive right now...

487
00:58:55,155 --> 00:59:01,102
I could not be alive if I don't
get answers soon...so stop the car!

488
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:05,208
Stop the goddamn car.

489
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:07,678
Alright.

490
00:59:23,443 --> 00:59:25,746
Where the hell you think you gonna go?

491
00:59:25,747 --> 00:59:29,024
They get your phone, remember?

492
00:59:31,492 --> 00:59:34,669
I get your SIM card information.

493
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:37,660
Kamila clone it.

494
00:59:38,008 --> 00:59:42,361
That's great! She's really want
to bother me on, didn't she!

495
00:59:42,362 --> 00:59:46,122
Yeah, let's said she did.
She risks her life protecting you!

496
00:59:46,123 --> 00:59:49,428
You know a lot of woman would do that for you?

497
00:59:50,006 --> 00:59:52,093
Forget about Kamila.

498
00:59:52,093 --> 00:59:54,635
You get me to Moscow or not?

499
00:59:54,635 --> 00:59:58,236
Mueller can, but I don't know
how I can convince him to do that.

500
00:59:58,237 --> 01:00:00,457
Russian cabie can do with the NSA kit?

501
01:00:00,458 --> 01:00:03,247
Yuri says yes, equipment,
he's get connections...

502
01:00:03,248 --> 01:00:06,308
- That's not good enough!
- Listen, that's precausion...we bought

503
01:00:06,329 --> 01:00:08,468
photography modeller from the Russians.

504
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:12,149
And that the things that we don't have,
shitest Chinese and the rally don't have,

505
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:16,190
I don't know how they get it with they jive in!

506
01:00:17,353 --> 01:00:19,664
Alright, may be so!

507
01:00:19,885 --> 01:00:22,871
What makes you think we could trust this guy?

508
01:00:22,872 --> 01:00:27,018
We could trust my help a lot more than trust your buddy from NSA!

509
01:00:31,479 --> 01:00:37,991
Ok, I'll get us to Moscow.
You better be right about this.

510
01:00:40,045 --> 01:00:44,698
<i>Moscow, Russia</i>

511
01:01:14,945 --> 01:01:16,690
Sir...

512
01:01:16,691 --> 01:01:19,784
Official recognition get a pick.

513
01:01:20,007 --> 01:01:22,641
Moscow!

514
01:01:28,153 --> 01:01:30,485
So there we're going!

515
01:01:31,209 --> 01:01:34,897
Your seat belt broken, it won't fasten!

516
01:01:34,898 --> 01:01:38,340
- Why you need fasten?
- 'Cause it's the law.

517
01:01:38,341 --> 01:01:42,722
<i>.........russian.........</i>

518
01:01:42,724 --> 01:01:45,645
Welcome to Moscow.

519
01:01:53,047 --> 01:01:56,554
- Yes, sir?
- They're in Moscow.

520
01:02:16,696 --> 01:02:20,105
Is that a B or 6?

521
01:02:21,093 --> 01:02:24,002
Max GTZ650?

522
01:02:24,354 --> 01:02:27,183
You come to Moscow afterall.

523
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,991
Who this man?

524
01:02:29,992 --> 01:02:34,400
- He's cool.
- Don't look cool. What do you want?

525
01:02:34,402 --> 01:02:36,701
Answers.

526
01:02:36,843 --> 01:02:39,459
It's my SIM info.

527
01:02:40,810 --> 01:02:43,303
- It's been you all along, hasn't it?
- Reed...
- Shut up!

528
01:02:43,304 --> 01:02:48,274
It's just happen you pick Max up at the airport
knows all about his phone and offer to help him?

529
01:02:48,275 --> 01:02:51,275
- I don't send messages, I swear.
- Prove it!

530
01:02:51,277 --> 01:02:55,938
You'll see all this well and find
out who're sending the messages.

531
01:02:56,006 --> 01:03:00,285
Reed, listen to me. We get to trust somebody.

532
01:03:01,635 --> 01:03:04,045
Just give me 3 hours.

533
01:03:04,047 --> 01:03:08,251
You try to run, I wll hunt you down.

534
01:03:11,781 --> 01:03:13,979
Come on.

535
01:03:21,602 --> 01:03:24,146
You are offen quiet.

536
01:03:24,284 --> 01:03:26,770
It's just strange being here.

537
01:03:26,888 --> 01:03:30,405
It was 'Cold War' centralise started up the bureau.

538
01:03:30,406 --> 01:03:34,138
You and FBI with Grant?
Do you like it?

539
01:03:34,425 --> 01:03:38,316
- Yeah, I did.
- So why you're leaving?

540
01:03:38,379 --> 01:03:40,663
I had a big mouth.

541
01:03:40,916 --> 01:03:43,178
Patriot Act was awfully millow.

542
01:03:43,179 --> 01:03:48,655
Pushing straight with the safeguard with
Burke and NSA wanted the fast track for approval...

543
01:03:48,656 --> 01:03:52,778
I didn't appreciate that somebody
on the inside speaking at!

544
01:03:52,783 --> 01:03:55,302
So you're forced out!

545
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:58,510
Oh...he had Grant take care of that!

546
01:03:58,511 --> 01:04:01,926
That's it? You just left?

547
01:04:02,095 --> 01:04:06,033
- What's good at freedom of speech, we can't use it!
- You just can't leave!

548
01:04:06,034 --> 01:04:08,879
- Why not?
- Reed.

549
01:04:08,881 --> 01:04:12,761
Don't abstract me it's a kind of guy who
can had people's money or plot a casino!

550
01:04:12,762 --> 01:04:16,657
Hey look...I'm taking care of myself!

551
01:04:17,211 --> 01:04:20,771
- And what are you doing here?
- Getting paid to find out who's doing this!

552
01:04:20,772 --> 01:04:26,124
- And you don't care who is this or why?
- Not even a little!

553
01:04:27,833 --> 01:04:31,355
Just think you'll feel sorry for yourself.

554
01:04:35,097 --> 01:04:38,139
Let's just get back, okay?

555
01:04:51,533 --> 01:04:53,931
- Did you figure it out?
- Yeah!

556
01:04:53,933 --> 01:04:59,115
- So who had sent out the messages?
- You won't like answers.

557
01:05:05,417 --> 01:05:09,688
This is the inter input / output stream
for all the messages sent to SIM.

558
01:05:09,689 --> 01:05:12,113
Box is empty.

559
01:05:12,114 --> 01:05:15,594
Nobody use Echelon to send messages!

560
01:05:15,595 --> 01:05:17,860
Echelon sent them itself.

561
01:05:17,879 --> 01:05:21,059
You get to be kidding me? That's your explanation?

562
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:24,252
- Wait, are you saying that it's alive?
- No, just following its programming.

563
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:26,704
That's your explanation?

564
01:05:27,813 --> 01:05:30,645
- I knew you wouldn't believe me.
- Yeah, you are damn right I don't believe you!

565
01:05:30,646 --> 01:05:33,148
You tell me to figure to this!

566
01:05:35,876 --> 01:05:41,449
This list is all Echelon intercept calls
containing SIM information and name Max Peterson.

567
01:05:41,545 --> 01:05:45,149
First I sub-search for information
related to Flight 4400.

568
01:05:45,225 --> 01:05:50,800
Night before you used the phone.
Echelon intercept that few analysis that Savanna Pool airport and cab.

569
01:05:50,801 --> 01:05:57,629
That's result indicate fuel efficiency exceeds
maximum, but fuel provider reports normal as caused!

570
01:05:57,631 --> 01:06:03,756
- Echelon knew Flight 4400 would crush.
- Yes, with probability of 94.67%.

571
01:06:03,757 --> 01:06:06,181
Not buying it!

572
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:08,079
- No?
- No!

573
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:12,198
Ok, let's get better.
Their crush, Echelon intercept SMS,

574
01:06:12,199 --> 01:06:15,302
sender was Chairman of Board of their corporation.

575
01:06:15,302 --> 01:06:18,540
Recipient was Li Lin Chao, director of Syzor.

576
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:22,757
Message by the read:
"Congratulations, our board has ratified your bid."

577
01:06:22,758 --> 01:06:26,407
- So Echelon intercepts SMS for a little insider's trading.
- Precisely!

578
01:06:26,408 --> 01:06:29,616
Big deal? Anyone with access Echelon could have done that!

579
01:06:29,617 --> 01:06:36,178
May be so! But only computer could have known that
tip by casino and high pay slot could pay off in one night!

580
01:06:36,406 --> 01:06:39,643
- And the Blackjack tables?
- Simple card counting!

581
01:06:39,644 --> 01:06:46,084
It's just watch the table, and calculate
probability of Blackjack or...

582
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,832
No one can count that fast!

583
01:06:47,833 --> 01:06:50,787
Echelon could access any security cameras in the world...

584
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:53,922
Nobody to use Echelon to send messages!

585
01:06:53,923 --> 01:06:56,574
Echelon sent them itself!

586
01:06:56,718 --> 01:07:02,489
- So, if Max has phone, it has Max.
- But why me?

587
01:07:02,490 --> 01:07:06,565
What so special about me?
Shit!

588
01:07:07,051 --> 01:07:11,645
- How do we get out of here?
- This stairway, hurry!

589
01:07:18,001 --> 01:07:20,333
Stairway!

590
01:07:58,080 --> 01:07:59,978
No!

591
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:35,133
- FBI crash course?
- Brooklyn childhood.

592
01:09:58,337 --> 01:10:00,560
Fuck this!

593
01:10:26,799 --> 01:10:29,158
Look for map.

594
01:10:41,454 --> 01:10:44,082
Ah...it's in Cyrillisch.

595
01:10:44,184 --> 01:10:45,291
- Left or right?
- I don't know!

596
01:10:45,291 --> 01:10:49,284
- Left or right? Left or right?
- Left!

597
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:57,433
- I mean right.
- Great!

598
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:08,416
Hold on.

599
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:29,125
- Reed, let's talk.
- Alright, Grant, I'll start.

600
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:54,590
- Jackass, I wasn't trying to kill you!
- Grab his another gun, it's on his ankle.

601
01:11:56,006 --> 01:11:59,193
- I can prove.
- Easy.

602
01:12:02,873 --> 01:12:05,962
<i>I see you
I want Max
or you die
Agent Grant.</i>

603
01:12:06,355 --> 01:12:08,922
Shit, alright, on your feet, Grant.

604
01:12:08,923 --> 01:12:12,831
Let's go, move it! Come on!

605
01:12:19,788 --> 01:12:22,436
I see you, I want Max.

606
01:12:22,437 --> 01:12:23,512
I need you.

607
01:12:23,513 --> 01:12:26,797
It'll only deal with you,
not even Burke can touch you now!

608
01:12:26,798 --> 01:12:30,002
Yeah? Funny way of showing it!

609
01:12:30,003 --> 01:12:34,271
- Until resumes contact, we stuck on...
- What do mean, it?

610
01:12:34,386 --> 01:12:38,645
We believe that Echelon may be sending the messages itself.

611
01:12:39,083 --> 01:12:42,315
Will you help us, Peterson?

612
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:45,363
Will you help us?

613
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:48,120
- Can I trust you?
- Of course, you can trust me.

614
01:12:48,121 --> 01:12:52,103
- I said: "Can I trust you?"
- Whoo...Max, what are you doing?

615
01:12:52,104 --> 01:12:56,556
- Can I trust you?
- Quit fucking around, man!

616
01:12:56,833 --> 01:12:59,791
You can trust me.

617
01:12:59,791 --> 01:13:02,415
You know what?

618
01:13:02,416 --> 01:13:06,895
- I believe you, sunshine!
- Give me that gun, damn thing.

619
01:13:06,896 --> 01:13:10,157
That was loud.

620
01:13:18,016 --> 01:13:20,495
What does it say?

621
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:22,602
What the hell is that means?

622
01:13:22,603 --> 01:13:26,666
<i>"Welcome back, Mr. Peterson.
Go to 68113. Acct 2T9"
It's a zip code, it's just
a first installation I did.</i>

623
01:13:26,667 --> 01:13:29,611
In Omaha.

624
01:13:29,770 --> 01:13:34,445
<i>North Atlantic</i>

625
01:13:41,386 --> 01:13:44,476
Sir, the NSA had uploaded the
informations on the Omaha facility.

626
01:13:44,477 --> 01:13:47,332
- Are we set up?
- Yes, we are coordinating with local SWAT.

627
01:13:47,333 --> 01:13:50,147
Good!

628
01:13:50,918 --> 01:13:56,354
The facility is a converted hang aboard
by start-up planning release bandwidth.

629
01:13:56,410 --> 01:13:59,228
That ring a bell?

630
01:13:59,229 --> 01:14:02,381
I remember it's a strange building, house serverings.

631
01:14:02,382 --> 01:14:06,372
Eventually for potential clients.
The company will sold it for auction before it even open.

632
01:14:06,373 --> 01:14:11,003
The place hasn't been an entrance since time of sale.
We're still trying to locate the counter owner.

633
01:14:11,004 --> 01:14:14,657
- What you do there?
- Same thing I'll always do.

634
01:14:14,658 --> 01:14:19,389
- Install Bios level fail safe circuitrie!
- Bios what?

635
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:23,575
- Password protection!
- I'm impressed!

636
01:14:23,576 --> 01:14:27,016
Always thought you were a little stupid!

637
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:32,699
You means stupid like, build a computer
then, knows absolutely everything?

638
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:35,542
And lose control of it?

639
01:14:35,543 --> 01:14:39,466
<i>Omaha, Nebraska</i>

640
01:15:02,251 --> 01:15:07,632
- Special Agent Grant, FBI. Are you ready?
- It's about, sir!

641
01:16:01,005 --> 01:16:05,155
- All clear!
- We'll take over from here.

642
01:16:18,872 --> 01:16:22,278
- Activate the grip.
- Yes, sir!

643
01:16:30,003 --> 01:16:33,284
Ok, now what?

644
01:16:39,264 --> 01:16:44,650
- Authorize Bios? You know how to do that?
- Yeah!

645
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:55,716
- Sir, we get the next text message: 'Authorize Bios'.
- Hang on!

646
01:16:56,591 --> 01:16:58,748
What the hell is 'Authorize Bios'?

647
01:16:58,749 --> 01:17:01,937
It opens the server for access so outside data can get in.

648
01:17:01,937 --> 01:17:03,100
Why would they want that?

649
01:17:03,101 --> 01:17:06,083
I don't know, but it will allow to see what's on the servers.

650
01:17:06,083 --> 01:17:08,887
Are you sure you want to opening up a pan door box of virus?

651
01:17:08,888 --> 01:17:13,208
No sir. They can preventing any existing
files and drives from getting in.

652
01:17:16,663 --> 01:17:18,624
Grant...

653
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:21,750
- Do it.
- Yes, sir!

654
01:17:26,216 --> 01:17:29,082
Turn it on!

655
01:17:29,297 --> 01:17:31,880
Yeah!

656
01:17:34,251 --> 01:17:38,101
Yeah, try not to fuck it up, Max.

657
01:17:56,470 --> 01:17:59,830
So far so good!

670

We finally track down the guy who owned this place!

671
01:19:28,149 --> 01:19:29,456
Great, now get him on the line.

672
01:19:29,457 --> 01:19:32,057

- What?

673
01:19:32,058 --> 01:19:35,108

- He's a realtor.

677
01:19:51,959 --> 01:19:57,123
- His credit card bought your phone!
- One of the other recipients!

678

01:20:25,306 --> 01:20:29,064
- Where's it going?
- Looks like...

682
01:20:29,244 --> 01:20:32,134
Nebraska.

683
01:20:36,852 --> 01:20:39,167
- Do a goddamn reboot.
- We can't.

684
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:42,816

- It's no longer here, sir!

685
01:20:42,817 --> 01:20:45,249

690

Yes, but get out and pass NSA firewalls, what it needed...

691
01:21:07,401 --> 01:21:11,980
- Someone at the Pentagon.
- Right.

692
01:21:12,645 --> 01:21:15,793
Ok, why is it even needed to leave NSA at all,

693
01:21:15,794 --> 01:21:19,675

694

<i>Echelon Upgrade</i>

695
01:21:25,328 --> 01:21:28,818

- What is it?

696

Sir, come take a look at this.

697
01:21:35,587 --> 01:21:40,122
- Now what?
- It's...upgrading itself!

698
01:21:40,461 --> 01:21:42,409
The upgrade?

699
01:21:42,410 --> 01:21:46,249
The Congress went a long way,
so it's giving it to itself.

700
01:21:46,250 --> 01:21:50,667
- It couldn't do that in NSA, could it?
- No, it is a temporary house.

701
01:21:50,668 --> 01:21:55,298
Long enough to take bridge into every computers on the net.

702
01:21:56,005 --> 01:22:00,333
- How could we stop it?
- Shut it down!

703
01:22:06,346 --> 01:22:10,160
- Don't try it!
- What's that?

704
01:22:11,083 --> 01:22:14,536
Looks like...financial records.

705
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:17,166
Oh, my God!

706
01:22:17,167 --> 01:22:20,685
It's taking entire country's money as hostage.

707
01:22:21,162 --> 01:22:25,496
Of course, 4 recipients work the hacks on us...right...

708
01:22:25,497 --> 01:22:28,699
and launch credit data to the facility in the country...

709
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:32,935
- Make sense!
- So if we turn it off, or we blow this place...

710
01:22:33,005 --> 01:22:37,043
- will it lose everything?
- No...no...no...hold on, if I could get
around our security fail-safe, somehow...

711
01:22:37,044 --> 01:22:40,624
I might be able to stop the
upgrade without losing the money.

712
01:22:40,625 --> 01:22:43,751
- Get to it.
- Alright.

713

- Sir, it's get it by the ball, he's trying
to find a safe way to shut it down.

718
01:23:09,816 --> 01:23:14,464

the greatest security advance in my lifetime...

723

724
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:38,490
Sir, if we do this, we wouldn't have security, it will!

- Burke, this is Reed.
- Reed.

730
01:24:09,178 --> 01:24:14,254
- I am sorry you get caught in the crossfire on this one.
- Yeah, I'm sure you are!

this thing had killed 4 people already!

732
01:24:27,584 --> 01:24:31,235
Which is unfortunate.
But Spencer assures me its mulfunctioning...

733
01:24:31,236 --> 01:24:35,044
because it hasn't been permitted
to follow it's original programming.

734
01:24:35,045 --> 01:24:37,448
Getting up the upgrade will cure that!

735
01:24:37,449 --> 01:24:41,978
- Once it installed, you have no control of it.
- We are at war, Reed!

736
01:24:41,979 --> 01:24:45,932
It's the computer act to the liberation, as small price to pay!

737
01:24:45,933 --> 01:24:48,247
Anyway we programme it, it's on our side!

738
01:24:48,248 --> 01:24:50,612

01:35:58,854 --> 01:36:01,353
Captain?

828
01:36:01,354 --> 01:36:02,655
What?

829
01:36:02,657 --> 01:36:05,457
I congratulate you, Major!

830
01:36:05,458 --> 01:36:08,658
It was a real threat to the world,
but you took care of it.

831
01:36:08,659 --> 01:36:12,894
Soon they will restore it
or will invent something else.

832
01:36:12,895 --> 01:36:18,924
Of course... of course...
However, for this reason we exist.

833
01:36:19,826 --> 01:36:26,212
At least this time they made sure that not
everything that man creates is good for them.

834
01:36:26,213 --> 01:36:31,242
It seems that today we were able to convince
the Americans to take the right decision.

835
01:36:31,243 --> 01:36:33,926
Yes.

836
01:36:39,495 --> 01:36:42,659
I'd like to...believe in it.
