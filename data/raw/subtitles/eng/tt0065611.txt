1
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:17,571
Often I think

2
00:00:17,697 --> 00:00:21,292
this sad old world

3
00:00:21,417 --> 00:00:25,933
is whistling in the dark

4
00:00:28,617 --> 00:00:31,131
Just like a child

5
00:00:31,257 --> 00:00:34,772
who, late from school

6
00:00:34,897 --> 00:00:37,491
walks bravely home

7
00:00:37,617 --> 00:00:41,690
through the park

8
00:00:41,817 --> 00:00:48,086
To keep their spirits soaring

9
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:54,128
and keep the night at bay

10
00:00:55,017 --> 00:00:57,690
Neither quite knowing

11
00:00:57,817 --> 00:01:01,173
which way they are going

12
00:01:01,537 --> 00:01:07,214
they sing the shadows away

13
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,456
Often I think

14
00:01:13,577 --> 00:01:17,616
my poor old heart

15
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:20,695
has given up

16
00:01:21,017 --> 00:01:24,851
for good

17
00:01:25,017 --> 00:01:27,736
And then I see

18
00:01:27,857 --> 00:01:31,293
a brand new face

19
00:01:31,417 --> 00:01:32,850
I glimpse

20
00:01:32,977 --> 00:01:37,687
some new neighbourhood

21
00:01:38,257 --> 00:01:41,488
So walk me back home

22
00:01:41,617 --> 00:01:45,496
my darling

23
00:01:45,617 --> 00:01:50,737
tell me dreams really come true

24
00:01:54,297 --> 00:01:56,811
Whistling

25
00:01:59,057 --> 00:02:01,207
whistling

26
00:02:03,977 --> 00:02:05,968
here

27
00:02:06,097 --> 00:02:11,615
in the dark with you

28
00:02:42,457 --> 00:02:46,496
So walk me back home

29
00:02:46,617 --> 00:02:50,610
my darling

30
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:56,892
tell me dreams really come true

31
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:02,056
Whistling

32
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:07,334
whistling

33
00:03:09,777 --> 00:03:15,727
here in the dark

34
00:03:16,657 --> 00:03:21,128
with you

35
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,449
Play Pack Up Your Troubles.

36
00:04:41,697 --> 00:04:43,528
Don't go. Don't worry.

37
00:04:43,897 --> 00:04:47,128
Pack up your troubles
in your old kit bag

38
00:04:47,257 --> 00:04:51,569
And smile, smile, smile

39
00:04:51,697 --> 00:04:55,406
While you've a lucifer to light your fag

40
00:04:55,537 --> 00:04:59,132
Smile, boys, that's the style

41
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:00,885
What's the use of worrying?

42
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:03,087
Get back to your seats.

43
00:05:03,217 --> 00:05:06,493
It never was worthwhile

44
00:05:06,737 --> 00:05:11,128
So pack up your troubles
in your old kit bag

45
00:05:11,257 --> 00:05:12,326
And smile

46
00:05:12,457 --> 00:05:13,446
Come on.

47
00:05:13,577 --> 00:05:14,930
Smile, smile

48
00:05:15,057 --> 00:05:16,046
Again!

49
00:05:16,177 --> 00:05:19,169
Pack up your troubles
in your old kit bag

50
00:05:19,297 --> 00:05:22,926
And smile, smile, smile

51
00:05:23,697 --> 00:05:27,736
While you've a lucifer to light your fag

52
00:05:27,857 --> 00:05:31,247
Smile, boys, that's the style

53
00:05:31,857 --> 00:05:35,213
What's the use of worrying?

54
00:05:35,337 --> 00:05:38,773
It never was worthwhile

55
00:05:38,897 --> 00:05:40,012
So

56
00:05:40,137 --> 00:05:43,413
Pack up your troubles
in your old kit bag

57
00:05:43,537 --> 00:05:45,653
And smile, smile, smile

58
00:05:45,777 --> 00:05:47,495
Keep the Home Fires Burning.

59
00:05:48,177 --> 00:05:52,090
Keep the home fires burning

60
00:05:52,457 --> 00:05:56,336
While your hearts are yearning

61
00:05:56,817 --> 00:06:00,526
Though your lads are far away

62
00:06:00,657 --> 00:06:04,889
They dream of home

63
00:06:05,457 --> 00:06:09,211
There's a silver lining

64
00:06:09,857 --> 00:06:13,486
Through the dark cloud shining

65
00:06:14,137 --> 00:06:17,766
Turn the dark cloud inside out

66
00:06:17,897 --> 00:06:19,046
Till the boys

67
00:06:19,177 --> 00:06:20,735
Tipperary!

68
00:06:20,857 --> 00:06:22,210
Come home

69
00:06:22,337 --> 00:06:26,967
It's a long way to Tipperary

70
00:06:27,097 --> 00:06:31,409
It's a long way to go

71
00:06:31,537 --> 00:06:35,928
It's a long way to Tipperary

72
00:06:36,057 --> 00:06:40,130
To the sweetest girl I know

73
00:06:40,977 --> 00:06:45,368
Goodbye, Piccadilly

74
00:06:45,497 --> 00:06:49,331
Farewell, Leicester Square

75
00:06:49,457 --> 00:06:53,973
It's a long, long way to Tipperary

76
00:06:54,097 --> 00:06:59,535
But my heart's right there

77
00:07:02,017 --> 00:07:03,086
Bravo!

78
00:08:37,777 --> 00:08:40,291
- Good evening, Miss Lili.
- Hello, Emma.

79
00:08:42,537 --> 00:08:45,097
- The Colonel's in the study.
- Thank you.

80
00:08:47,057 --> 00:08:49,287
- Emma, I'd love some tea.
- Yes, miss.

81
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:52,092
Kurt.

82
00:08:52,537 --> 00:08:53,731
How nice.

83
00:08:54,777 --> 00:08:56,768
- How are you, my dear?
- Fine.

84
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:01,894
That's most important, Lili.

85
00:09:02,017 --> 00:09:04,247
We must know
exactly how the Allies are planning

86
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,254
to utilise the military aircraft.

87
00:09:07,737 --> 00:09:09,090
The war is changing.

88
00:09:09,217 --> 00:09:12,050
It is moving into the air,

89
00:09:12,857 --> 00:09:13,892
and, Lili,

90
00:09:14,017 --> 00:09:16,406
we cannot afford to minimise
this new potential.

91
00:09:16,537 --> 00:09:19,176
As each new squadron is formed,
the air war expands,

92
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:22,209
the ground war is altered,
forced to shift,

93
00:09:22,337 --> 00:09:24,293
and to, how would you say,

94
00:09:25,657 --> 00:09:28,888
- to accommodate on a day-to-day basis.
- It's hard to believe.

95
00:09:29,017 --> 00:09:32,646
What, that those ridiculous little
aircrafts could make such a difference?

96
00:09:32,777 --> 00:09:35,769
Yesterday Baron von Richthofen led
six of those ridiculous little aircraft...

97
00:09:35,897 --> 00:09:39,776
Thank you. In an attack
on the ammunition depot in Toulon.

98
00:09:39,897 --> 00:09:42,536
The explosion
shattered windows in Paris.

99
00:09:42,657 --> 00:09:46,616
It also stopped a well-planned
enemy attack in the Argonne sector.

100
00:09:47,977 --> 00:09:49,649
Incidentally, I understand

101
00:09:49,777 --> 00:09:51,972
you're to be decorated
by the French government.

102
00:09:52,097 --> 00:09:53,132
Yes.

103
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,326
When?

104
00:09:56,457 --> 00:10:00,973
- No date's been set, but soon, I expect.
- The sooner the better.

105
00:10:26,257 --> 00:10:28,817
- Good evening, Mr Bedford.
- Good evening, Sergeant.

106
00:10:28,937 --> 00:10:32,327
Sorry to disturb you at this late hour,
but we've reason to believe

107
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:35,608
- there's a German spy in the vicinity.
- Blimey.

108
00:10:36,057 --> 00:10:38,776
You haven't seen
or heard anything suspicious, have you?

109
00:10:38,897 --> 00:10:41,695
Not a thing,
but I'll certainly let you know if I do.

110
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:44,647
Is Miss Lili down for the weekend?

111
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:47,086
Yes, her uncle's staying with us.

112
00:10:47,217 --> 00:10:49,651
I believe you met Mr von Ruger
when he was here last summer.

113
00:10:49,777 --> 00:10:52,166
Yes, the distinguished
Swedish gentleman.

114
00:10:52,297 --> 00:10:55,175
- Swiss.
- Yes, that's right, Swiss.

115
00:10:55,737 --> 00:10:58,046
Give Miss Lili my regards,
and her uncle,

116
00:10:58,177 --> 00:11:00,213
and keep your eyes open, Mr Bedford.

117
00:11:00,337 --> 00:11:03,534
- I certainly will. Good night, Sergeant.
- Good night.

118
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:11,611
Trouble?

119
00:11:12,217 --> 00:11:13,809
Nothing we can't handle.

120
00:11:14,337 --> 00:11:16,168
We just have to be careful.

121
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:19,849
Your assignment
is the famous Major William Larrabee.

122
00:11:21,137 --> 00:11:24,652
Of the five men having access
to the day-to-day planning of the air war,

123
00:11:24,777 --> 00:11:27,416
he would seem to be the best prospect.

124
00:11:27,537 --> 00:11:30,574
He's young, attractive, unmarried.

125
00:11:30,697 --> 00:11:32,449
That's a change.

126
00:11:32,577 --> 00:11:35,967
I'm getting weary
of diplomats and old generals.

127
00:11:36,657 --> 00:11:39,535
The Major is considered
to be quite the ladies' man.

128
00:11:40,177 --> 00:11:41,849
If you're gonna spend any length of time
in France

129
00:11:41,977 --> 00:11:44,730
you should arrange some concerts,
maybe visit some of the hospitals.

130
00:11:44,857 --> 00:11:46,006
Yes.

131
00:11:46,977 --> 00:11:48,092
Success.

132
00:11:49,217 --> 00:11:50,491
Major Larrabee.

133
00:16:22,057 --> 00:16:23,206
Look out!

134
00:16:26,377 --> 00:16:27,651
What's he doing?

135
00:17:48,057 --> 00:17:50,207
Good morning, Colonel.

136
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:51,452
General.

137
00:17:52,457 --> 00:17:53,970
You know Kraus?

138
00:17:55,097 --> 00:17:56,086
Yes.

139
00:17:56,937 --> 00:18:00,816
I understand you've assigned
Project Sparrow to Lili Smith.

140
00:18:00,937 --> 00:18:02,336
Lili Schmidt.

141
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:05,255
But that, my dear Colonel,
is precisely the distinction

142
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:07,493
that separates our points of view.

143
00:18:07,617 --> 00:18:10,927
You say Schmidt, I say Smith.

144
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:12,775
Her father was German.

145
00:18:12,897 --> 00:18:17,493
Her mother is English.
Lili Smith is an English subject.

146
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:20,172
She left Germany when she was 10.

147
00:18:20,297 --> 00:18:24,006
Forgive me, General, but I am not going
to debate this issue with you again.

148
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,695
Her record speaks for itself.

149
00:18:25,817 --> 00:18:29,935
My dear Colonel, I'm almost as
impressed with her record as you are.

150
00:18:30,057 --> 00:18:31,615
Impressed,

151
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:33,090
not convinced.

152
00:18:33,617 --> 00:18:35,812
That is unfortunate, General,

153
00:18:35,937 --> 00:18:37,814
because until I am relieved
of my command,

154
00:18:37,937 --> 00:18:41,691
or you obtain the necessary authority
to countermand my orders,

155
00:18:41,817 --> 00:18:44,126
I will continue to assign to Lili Schmidt

156
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:47,090
whatever project
seems to me appropriate.

157
00:18:54,297 --> 00:18:56,492
You forget yourself, Colonel.

158
00:18:56,617 --> 00:18:59,654
I am still your superior officer,
and I will stop you

159
00:18:59,777 --> 00:19:02,052
if I have to go to the Kaiser to do it.

160
00:19:02,177 --> 00:19:04,133
I'll be happy
to make an appointment for you.

161
00:19:04,257 --> 00:19:06,896
I'm having lunch with him this afternoon.

162
00:19:07,417 --> 00:19:10,693
Von Ruger,
that woman is a security risk.

163
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,808
She's an emotional female
who, in my opinion,

164
00:19:12,937 --> 00:19:14,689
involved herself
for all the wrong reasons

165
00:19:14,817 --> 00:19:16,808
and because of your
personal relationship,

166
00:19:16,937 --> 00:19:19,576
you refuse to admit
the potential danger!

167
00:19:20,897 --> 00:19:24,526
Concerning my personal relationship
with the lady, General,

168
00:19:25,137 --> 00:19:28,049
it is, first, none of your business
and second,

169
00:19:28,217 --> 00:19:31,050
it in no way influences
her capabilities as an agent.

170
00:19:31,177 --> 00:19:34,294
Regardless of what you may think,
she is the perfect spy,

171
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:37,170
and the ideal person
to succeed with Project Sparrow.

172
00:19:37,297 --> 00:19:40,130
And now, if you'll forgive me,
I'll be late for lunch.

173
00:19:43,217 --> 00:19:44,286
Kraus.

174
00:19:46,457 --> 00:19:50,609
They tell a story back in London town

175
00:19:50,737 --> 00:19:55,174
That when you hear taps sound

176
00:19:55,297 --> 00:19:59,529
Then all you soldiers have a sweetheart

177
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:02,729
Who always comes

178
00:20:02,857 --> 00:20:06,133
around

179
00:20:09,657 --> 00:20:14,094
When night is falling

180
00:20:14,217 --> 00:20:16,173
She comes calling

181
00:20:16,297 --> 00:20:21,212
The girl in no man's land

182
00:20:22,017 --> 00:20:25,487
She comes to cheer them

183
00:20:25,617 --> 00:20:27,528
And be near them

184
00:20:27,657 --> 00:20:32,731
The dream they understand

185
00:20:34,577 --> 00:20:36,647
Doughboys

186
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,530
weary, cold, and lonely

187
00:20:39,657 --> 00:20:42,615
Know her

188
00:20:42,737 --> 00:20:45,570
as their one and only

189
00:20:45,697 --> 00:20:48,530
The angel who

190
00:20:48,657 --> 00:20:52,536
at close of day

191
00:20:52,657 --> 00:20:55,615
Comes 'round to kiss

192
00:20:55,737 --> 00:20:57,932
their cares

193
00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:01,732
away

194
00:21:01,857 --> 00:21:06,089
When this is over

195
00:21:06,217 --> 00:21:07,857
You'll discover

196
00:21:08,177 --> 00:21:09,576
The love

197
00:21:09,697 --> 00:21:13,849
you've always planned

198
00:21:14,217 --> 00:21:17,607
Until that time

199
00:21:17,937 --> 00:21:22,055
pretend that I'm

200
00:21:22,177 --> 00:21:24,247
The girl

201
00:21:24,377 --> 00:21:31,408
in no man's land

202
00:21:55,377 --> 00:21:59,450
Doughboys weary, cold, and lonely

203
00:21:59,577 --> 00:22:02,375
Know her

204
00:22:02,497 --> 00:22:05,216
as their one and only

205
00:22:05,337 --> 00:22:08,329
The angel who

206
00:22:08,457 --> 00:22:12,006
at close of day

207
00:22:12,137 --> 00:22:15,891
Comes 'round to kiss

208
00:22:16,017 --> 00:22:22,365
their cares away

209
00:22:22,497 --> 00:22:27,013
When this is over

210
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,128
You'll discover

211
00:22:29,257 --> 00:22:34,729
The love you've always planned

212
00:22:35,737 --> 00:22:39,286
Until that time

213
00:22:40,137 --> 00:22:44,892
pretend that I'm

214
00:22:45,337 --> 00:22:48,727
The girl

215
00:22:49,697 --> 00:22:55,090
in no man's

216
00:22:55,217 --> 00:22:59,654
land

217
00:23:04,337 --> 00:23:05,565
Very good.

218
00:23:06,537 --> 00:23:08,095
Very good, my dear.

219
00:23:08,737 --> 00:23:11,968
Damn good show, old girl.
Damn good show.

220
00:23:33,137 --> 00:23:35,014
Just seat me there.

221
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:40,412
Alors, jouons Rainy Day, d'accord?

222
00:23:47,457 --> 00:23:49,334
Smile away

223
00:23:49,457 --> 00:23:52,847
each rainy day

224
00:23:53,577 --> 00:23:59,049
And laugh away your blues

225
00:23:59,177 --> 00:24:02,772
Be like old Mr Noah

226
00:24:02,897 --> 00:24:06,856
When it starts to pour

227
00:24:06,977 --> 00:24:10,333
Make fun of trouble

228
00:24:10,457 --> 00:24:14,132
Although you're seein' double

229
00:24:14,257 --> 00:24:16,088
Keep in mind

230
00:24:16,217 --> 00:24:20,495
they're silver-lined

231
00:24:20,617 --> 00:24:26,374
Those gloomy clouds of grey

232
00:24:26,497 --> 00:24:30,775
Let love light the sky up

233
00:24:30,897 --> 00:24:33,411
Tell the clouds to dry up

234
00:24:33,537 --> 00:24:39,248
And smile away each rainy day

235
00:24:54,057 --> 00:24:55,456
Here he comes.

236
00:25:01,537 --> 00:25:04,290
I have to dine
with two generals this evening.

237
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:06,446
The unofficial headquarters

238
00:25:06,577 --> 00:25:09,171
of Major Larrabee's squadron
is the Cafe Cancan.

239
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:54,765
Excuse me, ma'am, General.

240
00:27:56,137 --> 00:27:59,652
'Cause I'm a little drunk,
but there's something I just got to say.

241
00:28:00,297 --> 00:28:03,448
- Ma'am, you are an inspiration.
- Thank you.

242
00:28:03,577 --> 00:28:05,693
I heard you sing in London,
and you sang

243
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:10,095
It's a long way to Tipperary

244
00:28:10,217 --> 00:28:13,095
And, ma'am, it was inspirational!

245
00:28:16,497 --> 00:28:17,486
What was that?

246
00:28:17,617 --> 00:28:20,256
I just told the General you heard me
sing It's a Long Way to Tipperary.

247
00:28:20,377 --> 00:28:23,096
Oh, yeah, you should've heard her,
General. You, too, General.

248
00:28:23,217 --> 00:28:25,777
It was purely, purely inspirational.

249
00:28:25,897 --> 00:28:27,649
- Thank you.
- Thank you, ma'am.

250
00:28:30,817 --> 00:28:31,886
What was that?

251
00:28:32,017 --> 00:28:33,215
He says you're
one of the famous Eagle Squadron.

252
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,414
He says you're
one of the famous Eagle Squadron.

253
00:28:34,537 --> 00:28:36,448
Yes, ma'am.

254
00:28:36,577 --> 00:28:39,375
Lieutenant George
"Youngblood" Carson.

255
00:28:39,497 --> 00:28:40,566
How do you do?

256
00:28:40,697 --> 00:28:43,416
My grandmother
was a full-blooded Cherokee Indian.

257
00:28:43,537 --> 00:28:46,688
- How exciting.
- It was for my granddaddy.

258
00:28:46,817 --> 00:28:49,889
Listen, if it wouldn't be
putting you to too much trouble,

259
00:28:50,017 --> 00:28:52,895
I've got some buddies over there
just dying to meet you.

260
00:28:53,017 --> 00:28:54,370
Hey, fellows!

261
00:28:56,937 --> 00:28:58,336
- What's happening?
- Come here.

262
00:28:58,977 --> 00:29:01,252
Don't get up, General,
it's just my squadron.

263
00:29:01,377 --> 00:29:04,813
- Meet Miss Lili Smith.
- How do you do, miss? I'm...

264
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:14,766
Come on, Long Way to Tipperary.

265
00:29:14,897 --> 00:29:17,365
You know it. Let's hear it.

266
00:29:17,497 --> 00:29:21,092
Yeah, jolly good, that's it. Yeah, that's it.

267
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,651
Hey, everyone. Come on, everyone.

268
00:29:23,777 --> 00:29:26,052
Pick it up.

269
00:29:26,177 --> 00:29:29,328
Sing it. Sing it for me. Let's hear it.

270
00:29:29,457 --> 00:29:33,211
Yes, sing it for me.
Now, sing it for me. Sing it.

271
00:29:33,337 --> 00:29:36,329
Hello. I should sing and dance it.

272
00:29:36,457 --> 00:29:39,813
That's it. Oh, yeah. Singing it.

273
00:29:40,977 --> 00:29:44,890
Everybody give it to me.

274
00:29:47,817 --> 00:29:51,412
It's a long way to Tipperary

275
00:29:51,537 --> 00:29:52,652
Thank you.

276
00:29:52,777 --> 00:29:56,167
It's a long way to go

277
00:29:56,297 --> 00:30:00,575
It's a long way to Tipperary

278
00:30:00,697 --> 00:30:05,452
To the sweetest girl I know

279
00:30:05,577 --> 00:30:09,695
Goodbye, Piccadilly

280
00:30:09,817 --> 00:30:13,048
Farewell, Leicester Square

281
00:30:13,177 --> 00:30:14,735
There it is.

282
00:30:14,857 --> 00:30:18,008
It's a long, long way to Tipperary

283
00:30:18,137 --> 00:30:23,769
But my heart's right there

284
00:30:27,337 --> 00:30:29,328
Hey, come on.

285
00:30:29,937 --> 00:30:33,486
Mademoiselle from Armentières
Parlez-vous

286
00:30:33,617 --> 00:30:37,496
Mademoiselle from Armentières
Hasn't been kissed in 40 years

287
00:30:37,617 --> 00:30:41,132
Hinky-dinky parlez-vous

288
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:44,886
Mademoiselle from Armentières
Parlez-vous

289

Mademoiselle from Armentières
Parlez-vous

290
00:30:48,657 --> 00:30:50,329
She got the Palm
and the Croix de Guerre

291
00:30:50,457 --> 00:30:52,209
For washin' soldiers' underwear

292
00:30:52,337 --> 00:30:55,170
Hinky-dinky parlez-vous

293
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:59,526
One night I had beaucoup jack
Parlez-vous

294
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:01,329
One night I had beaucoup jack

295
00:31:01,457 --> 00:31:05,211
Gentlemen, you are dears, and I would
love to kiss you all good night,

296
00:31:05,337 --> 00:31:06,816
but...

297
00:31:06,937 --> 00:31:10,247
But I'm only a tourist,
not a permanent resident.

298
00:31:10,377 --> 00:31:13,687
- Wait a minute, she's got a point.
- What point?

299
00:31:13,817 --> 00:31:17,696
You're beautiful,
but you're just too much.

300
00:31:17,817 --> 00:31:21,776
So, in the interest of saving time,
and as the senior Cherokee Indian,

301
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:25,208
I will say good night for us all.

302
00:31:27,737 --> 00:31:30,251
- Miss Lili.
- Lieutenant?

303
00:31:31,217 --> 00:31:32,855
Plant it right here.

304
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:48,454
Inspirational. Purely inspirational.

305
00:31:48,777 --> 00:31:50,768
- Good night.
- Good night.

306
00:31:56,497 --> 00:32:00,012
Mademoiselle from Armentières
Parlez-vous

307
00:32:00,137 --> 00:32:03,766
Mademoiselle from Armentières
Hasn't been kissed in 40 years

308
00:32:03,897 --> 00:32:07,333
Hinky-dinky parlez-vous

309
00:32:07,457 --> 00:32:10,927
The General got the Croix de Guerre
Parlez-vous

310
00:32:11,057 --> 00:32:14,493
The General got the Croix de Guerre
Parlez-vous

311
00:32:27,337 --> 00:32:28,406
Allô?

312
00:32:28,537 --> 00:32:30,892
- Hello, uncle.
- Hello, my dear.

313
00:32:31,017 --> 00:32:32,052
How was the evening?

314
00:32:32,177 --> 00:32:34,691
- You should know, you were there.
- You don't miss anything, do you?

315
00:32:34,817 --> 00:32:36,011
One of Major Larrabee's men said

316
00:32:36,137 --> 00:32:38,048
he was on some kind
of important mission.

317
00:32:38,177 --> 00:32:39,530
That's too bad.

318
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:41,613
I've no doubt you'll meet
the Major another time.

319
00:32:41,737 --> 00:32:44,934
I hope so. In the meantime,
should we get together?

320
00:32:45,057 --> 00:32:48,208
How about a late breakfast,
say around noon?

321
00:32:48,337 --> 00:32:50,805
- I look forward to seeing you.
- Bye, darling.

322
00:32:50,937 --> 00:32:52,211
Bye, uncle.

323
00:32:53,937 --> 00:32:55,734
- Any instructions?
- No.

324
00:33:28,177 --> 00:33:29,610
Thank you.

325
00:33:29,737 --> 00:33:33,252
- I'm Bill Larrabee.
- How do you do?

326
00:33:33,377 --> 00:33:35,845
I have champagne, caviar,
marinated truffles,

327
00:33:35,977 --> 00:33:39,014
brilliant foie gras, and half a dozen
assorted Hungarian Gypsies.

328
00:33:39,137 --> 00:33:40,172
Sounds delicious.

329
00:33:40,297 --> 00:33:43,528
- I thought we'd go on a picnic.
- At 3:00 in the morning?

330
00:33:43,657 --> 00:33:45,727
It's the best time. No ants.

331
00:35:31,977 --> 00:35:34,650
- That's my squadron, dawn patrol.
- Is it?

332
00:35:36,417 --> 00:35:39,295
- When do you have to report back?
- Friday.

333
00:35:39,417 --> 00:35:41,453
When do you have to
go back to England?

334
00:35:41,577 --> 00:35:42,646
Soon.

335
00:35:42,777 --> 00:35:44,608
Not too soon, I hope.

336
00:35:45,297 --> 00:35:48,130
- It depends.
- On what?

337
00:35:48,497 --> 00:35:52,490
I'm beginning to think, Major,
it might just possibly depend on you.

338
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,414
What's he like?

339
00:36:04,177 --> 00:36:06,327
Attractive, charming,

340
00:36:07,697 --> 00:36:09,016
conceited.

341
00:36:10,257 --> 00:36:11,636
- And when do you see him again?
- Tonight.

342
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:13,015
- And when do you see him again?
- Tonight.

343
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:15,856
He's on leave until Friday.

344
00:36:15,977 --> 00:36:18,491
You better get some sleep.

345
00:36:18,617 --> 00:36:20,175
I think you're right.

346
00:36:20,297 --> 00:36:23,050
No, relax.
Stay and finish your breakfast.

347
00:36:23,177 --> 00:36:25,611
I'll contact you the minute
I have something important.

348
00:36:25,737 --> 00:36:27,967
- Pleasant dreams.
- Thank you, darling.

349
00:36:29,337 --> 00:36:33,296
- A picnic at 3:00 in the morning.
- Best time. No ants.

350
00:38:21,057 --> 00:38:22,888
It's 11:00, Miss Lili.

351
00:41:16,777 --> 00:41:19,166
- Good night.
- Good night.

352
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:21,530
Good night?

353
00:41:22,457 --> 00:41:23,890
I fly at dawn.

354
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:27,769
Good night, darling.

355
00:41:38,977 --> 00:41:40,171
"I fly at dawn"?

356
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:42,253
- Quote, unquote.
- Amazing.

357
00:41:42,897 --> 00:41:46,333
Yes, makes a girl feel a bit insecure.

358
00:41:46,457 --> 00:41:48,015
You? Insecure?

359
00:41:48,137 --> 00:41:52,528
Not really, but, you must admit,
it is a bit unnatural.

360
00:41:52,657 --> 00:41:56,969
Yes, considering the provocation,
but that's really beside the point.

361
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,132
It is?

362
00:41:58,257 --> 00:42:00,373
The information you've extracted
from Major Larrabee

363
00:42:00,497 --> 00:42:04,968
has greatly exceeded our expectations,
and should the need

364
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:09,730
for more persuasive measures arise,
I'm sure that you'll be up to it.

365
00:42:10,257 --> 00:42:13,010
Yes, but will Major Larrabee?

366
00:42:28,897 --> 00:42:31,491
The gentlemen
are from French army intelligence.

367
00:42:31,617 --> 00:42:32,811
Are they?

368
00:42:39,377 --> 00:42:40,890
Mademoiselle Smith,
what a pleasure to meet you.

369
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:42,052
Good morning.

370
00:42:42,177 --> 00:42:44,850
- Please forgive us this intrusion.
- No intrusion at all.

371
00:42:44,977 --> 00:42:46,695
This is my colleague,
Lieutenant Liggett.

372
00:42:46,817 --> 00:42:47,932
Very...

373
00:42:48,057 --> 00:42:50,013
And I am Captain Duvalle.

374
00:42:50,137 --> 00:42:52,526
We are with army intelligence.

375
00:42:52,657 --> 00:42:54,010
Won't you sit down?

376
00:42:57,417 --> 00:42:58,736
Now, how can I help you?

377
00:42:58,857 --> 00:43:02,327
You are a friend
of Major William F. Larrabee.

378
00:43:03,457 --> 00:43:04,606
Yes.

379
00:43:06,697 --> 00:43:09,450
We have reason to believe
that Major Larrabee

380
00:43:09,577 --> 00:43:12,216
is passing military secrets to the enemy.

381
00:43:14,057 --> 00:43:15,809
You can't be serious.

382
00:43:15,937 --> 00:43:19,293
There is no question
that vital data is leaking out

383
00:43:19,417 --> 00:43:21,692
concerning allied air operations.

384
00:43:22,257 --> 00:43:25,488
And, mind, there are very few men
having access to this information.

385
00:43:25,617 --> 00:43:27,733
The foremost is Major Larrabee.

386
00:43:29,057 --> 00:43:31,935
We strongly suspect
that he is passing the information

387
00:43:32,057 --> 00:43:33,968
to a German secret agent.

388
00:43:34,097 --> 00:43:37,806
But this is preposterous, even to
suggest that Major Larrabee's a traitor.

389
00:43:37,937 --> 00:43:41,850
I hope I'm wrong
and that is why we are here.

390
00:43:41,977 --> 00:43:43,854
We need your cooperation.

391
00:43:45,297 --> 00:43:47,447
What sort of cooperation?

392
00:43:48,337 --> 00:43:52,296
Watch, listen,
report anything suspicious.

393
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:57,046
- You're asking me to be an informer.
- I'm asking you to help establish

394
00:43:57,177 --> 00:44:00,089
Major Larrabee's guilt or innocence.

395
00:44:01,017 --> 00:44:02,370
Mademoiselle Smith,

396
00:44:03,097 --> 00:44:06,373
we must discover
who this German agent is

397
00:44:06,497 --> 00:44:09,136
and apprehend her.

398
00:44:09,257 --> 00:44:12,533
It is a matter of national sécurité.

399
00:44:12,657 --> 00:44:14,887
It is a matter of self-respect.

400
00:44:15,017 --> 00:44:16,769
When you have some proof
of your allegations,

401
00:44:16,897 --> 00:44:19,127
then I might, perhaps, reconsider.

402
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:22,371
- Her?
- Pardon?

403
00:44:22,497 --> 00:44:24,886
- You said apprehend her.
- I...

404
00:44:25,417 --> 00:44:29,456
It's our opinion that Major Larrabee
is giving information to a woman.

405
00:44:29,577 --> 00:44:31,807
Of course, it's only an opinion.

406
00:44:32,857 --> 00:44:36,975
It seems reasonable
to assume that a man like the Major...

407
00:44:38,577 --> 00:44:40,647
I mean, with his record...

408
00:44:42,257 --> 00:44:43,815
Military record.

409
00:44:44,257 --> 00:44:48,967
If he is passing information
to the enemy, he is doing so unwillingly.

410
00:44:49,697 --> 00:44:53,167
I mean, unknowingly. He's being

411
00:44:54,377 --> 00:44:55,526
coerced.

412
00:44:56,257 --> 00:44:57,929
He's being seduced.

413
00:44:59,857 --> 00:45:00,972
Yes.

414
00:45:01,697 --> 00:45:03,369
As I've said before,
when you have some proof,

415
00:45:03,497 --> 00:45:05,089
then I might consider helping you,

416
00:45:05,217 --> 00:45:07,492
but until such time,
I'm afraid it's out of the question.

417
00:45:07,617 --> 00:45:08,811
Now, if you'll excuse me.

418
00:45:08,937 --> 00:45:11,849
Naturally, of course, we can count
on your discretion in this matter.

419
00:45:11,977 --> 00:45:13,649
- Naturally.
- Good day.

420
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:15,335
- Good day.
- Good day.

421
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,654
- You heard?
- Yes.

422
00:45:33,057 --> 00:45:35,935
If I continue with Major Larrabee,

423
00:45:36,057 --> 00:45:37,331
it could be just a matter of time

424
00:45:37,457 --> 00:45:40,369
before they discover
that I'm the one they want.

425
00:45:42,137 --> 00:45:44,173
On the other hand,
if I stop seeing the Major

426
00:45:44,297 --> 00:45:47,255
and the flow of information
stops at the same time,

427
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:49,493
they'll know immediately.

428
00:45:52,377 --> 00:45:54,129
Interesting situation.

429
00:46:03,097 --> 00:46:05,327
If you're good at riddle solving

430
00:46:05,457 --> 00:46:07,652
If you make the claim

431
00:46:07,777 --> 00:46:12,009
That no puzzle ever puzzles you

432
00:46:12,537 --> 00:46:15,097
Here is one that needs evolving

433
00:46:15,217 --> 00:46:17,492
Here's a guessing game

434
00:46:18,337 --> 00:46:23,206
That should be a snap for you to do

435
00:46:32,617 --> 00:46:36,132
I'll give you three guesses

436
00:46:36,257 --> 00:46:39,647
Who loves you

437
00:46:39,777 --> 00:46:45,534
Who's loved you
Right from the start

438
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:49,254
Not your mother

439
00:46:49,377 --> 00:46:53,655
Who likes to baby you so

440
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:57,133
And not the girl back home

441
00:46:57,257 --> 00:47:00,613
You used to know, oh, no

442
00:47:00,737 --> 00:47:07,176
There's somebody special
Who needs you

443
00:47:08,177 --> 00:47:13,774
Together or apart

444
00:47:14,577 --> 00:47:18,365
Bet you don't need three guesses

445
00:47:18,497 --> 00:47:21,887
And not even two

446
00:47:22,017 --> 00:47:27,728
To know that I'm the one
Sweetheart

447
00:48:28,017 --> 00:48:34,092
There's somebody special
Who needs you

448
00:48:35,057 --> 00:48:40,256
Together or apart

449
00:48:41,617 --> 00:48:45,769
Bet you don't need three guesses

450
00:48:45,897 --> 00:48:49,014
And not even two

451
00:48:49,497 --> 00:48:54,776
To know that I'm the one

452
00:48:55,737 --> 00:49:00,447
Sweetheart

453
00:49:15,657 --> 00:49:18,774
Miss Smith!
Miss Smith, your curtain call.

454
00:49:39,617 --> 00:49:41,448
Would it be indiscreet
to say that I missed you?

455
00:49:41,577 --> 00:49:42,612
No.

456
00:49:42,737 --> 00:49:44,853
- To say that I missed you terribly?
- Not quite.

457
00:49:44,977 --> 00:49:46,296
Desperately?

458
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:47,930
- Possibly.
- Passionately?

459
00:49:48,057 --> 00:49:50,207
- Definitely.
- Would you settle for desperately?

460
00:49:50,337 --> 00:49:52,407
I'll settle for passionately.

461
00:49:52,537 --> 00:49:55,813
- What about my reputation?
- I'll risk it.

462
00:49:57,217 --> 00:49:58,889
You look tired, darling.

463
00:49:59,337 --> 00:50:01,248
- I am, a little bit.
- Was it that bad?

464
00:50:01,377 --> 00:50:03,254
No, not that bad, but bad.

465
00:50:03,937 --> 00:50:05,848
- The Baron plays pretty rough.
- The Baron?

466
00:50:05,977 --> 00:50:07,330
Von Richthofen.

467
00:50:09,217 --> 00:50:11,447
He fights very well, that gentleman.

468
00:50:11,577 --> 00:50:13,693
- When do you have to be back?
- Sunday.

469
00:50:14,217 --> 00:50:17,573
- Not till Sunday night.
- Then you can get plenty of rest.

470
00:50:18,817 --> 00:50:20,694
I thought, if you have nothing to do,

471
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:22,694
we could ride
out to the country tomorrow.

472
00:50:22,817 --> 00:50:26,810
I know a lovely little spot.
Quiet, romantic,

473
00:50:28,017 --> 00:50:31,168
guaranteed to restore the body
and renovate the soul.

474
00:50:31,297 --> 00:50:32,730
Or is it the other way around?

475
00:50:32,857 --> 00:50:35,212
- Either way, it sounds marvellous.
- Marvellous it is.

476
00:50:35,337 --> 00:50:37,726
And tonight we eat, we drink,

477
00:50:37,857 --> 00:50:40,974
- we forget the Baron.
- It really was bad, wasn't it?

478
00:50:43,817 --> 00:50:45,170
It was hell.

479
00:51:19,337 --> 00:51:20,975
Army intelligence.

480
00:51:22,097 --> 00:51:23,928
We would like a table for two.

481
00:51:24,057 --> 00:51:29,768
And as near as possible, if you please,
to Major Larrabee's table.

482
00:51:29,897 --> 00:51:31,774
I don't understand.

483
00:51:31,897 --> 00:51:34,047
I'm aware that we have no reservations,

484
00:51:34,177 --> 00:51:37,374
but this is official government business.

485
00:51:37,497 --> 00:51:38,930
Allez. Allez.

486
00:51:39,057 --> 00:51:42,208
I am sorry, but I am not the head waiter.

487
00:51:42,337 --> 00:51:45,409
- Go find the head waiter.
- Oui.

488
00:51:45,537 --> 00:51:47,334
My apologies, monsieur.

489
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:54,805
Thank you.

490
00:51:56,417 --> 00:51:59,966
- Are they really that good?
- Yes, they're delicious. Will you try one?

491
00:52:00,097 --> 00:52:01,928
- No.
- Come on, try one.

492
00:52:02,057 --> 00:52:04,207
- Some other time.
- My foot!

493
00:52:04,657 --> 00:52:06,170
Your drink, my foot.

494
00:52:06,297 --> 00:52:08,606
Now, go on, there we are.
Sit down, old sport.

495
00:52:08,737 --> 00:52:12,525
There you are, you can sit down there.
Good girl. And I'll sit down...

496
00:52:12,657 --> 00:52:14,090
Excuse me, could we borrow this chair?

497
00:52:14,217 --> 00:52:15,252
Yes, of course.

498
00:52:15,377 --> 00:52:17,811
I have to put my leg up.
You see, I've got a plaster and...

499
00:52:17,937 --> 00:52:19,848
Good God.

500
00:52:20,417 --> 00:52:22,009
I thought you were in hospital.

501
00:52:22,137 --> 00:52:24,207
My goodness me.
They let you out, too, did they?

502
00:52:24,337 --> 00:52:27,010
- How are you? Any better?
- I'm fine, thank you.

503
00:52:27,137 --> 00:52:29,571
Yes, well, so am I.
I mean, with this thing here,

504
00:52:29,697 --> 00:52:32,450
and I'm over there with...
I don't know what her name is.

505
00:52:32,577 --> 00:52:35,171
- Anyway, who are you with?
- Major Larrabee.

506
00:52:35,297 --> 00:52:36,969
Major Larrabee?

507
00:52:37,097 --> 00:52:39,816
I know him very well.
We fly together everywhere.

508
00:52:39,937 --> 00:52:42,132
- Really?
- Yes, we do.

509
00:52:44,657 --> 00:52:46,966
- Hello, old cock.
- Hello.

510
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:49,406
- We've just been talking about you.
- Were you?

511
00:52:49,537 --> 00:52:52,813
Yes. Nice to see you
up and about again,

512
00:52:52,937 --> 00:52:57,453
even though you are sitting down.
Anyway, bye-bye, now.

513
00:52:57,577 --> 00:52:59,727
Very nice, dear. Off we go.

514
00:52:59,857 --> 00:53:01,495
And I'll see you...

515
00:53:01,617 --> 00:53:06,054
Incidentally, old cock,
how did you fare this weekend

516
00:53:06,177 --> 00:53:08,407
with Operation Crepe Suzette?

517
00:53:09,297 --> 00:53:12,687
Incidentally, old cock,
that mission was top-secret.

518
00:53:13,617 --> 00:53:14,766
Oh. Yes, yes.

519
00:53:15,497 --> 00:53:16,486
What?

520
00:53:17,577 --> 00:53:20,774
Just a minute.
Get that thing down, you fool.

521
00:53:21,897 --> 00:53:23,410
Back with that.

522
00:53:39,697 --> 00:53:41,415
Get these men off me!

523
00:53:45,937 --> 00:53:48,497
And it happens that he's drunk,
always is.

524
00:53:48,617 --> 00:53:50,175
- Even when he flies?
- Always is.

525
00:53:50,297 --> 00:53:51,491
I don't believe it.

526
00:53:51,617 --> 00:53:52,970
- Really?
- Yeah.

527
00:53:53,097 --> 00:53:56,248
- But then why does he drink?
- Because he's afraid to fly.

528
00:53:56,377 --> 00:53:59,528
- Then why does he fly?
- Because he likes to drink.

529
00:54:00,337 --> 00:54:02,646
Well, sooner or later,
he's bound to get himself killed.

530
00:54:02,777 --> 00:54:04,688
Sooner or later, he probably will.

531
00:54:04,817 --> 00:54:07,331
Meanwhile, he has seven planes
to his credit.

532
00:54:07,457 --> 00:54:10,290
- What? You're not serious.
- I certainly am.

533
00:54:12,017 --> 00:54:14,167
You mean
he shot down seven German planes?

534
00:54:14,297 --> 00:54:17,095
- No, he shot down seven French planes.
- What?

535
00:54:17,217 --> 00:54:19,936
Actually, he only shot down one.

536
00:54:20,057 --> 00:54:21,331
The rest he just wrecked.

537
00:54:21,457 --> 00:54:24,255
And when you consider he's only been
at the front for about six months,

538
00:54:24,377 --> 00:54:26,413
it's an incredible record.

539
00:54:26,537 --> 00:54:29,051
- And you're an incredible liar.
- My word of honour.

540
00:54:29,177 --> 00:54:30,166
As of last Friday,

541
00:54:30,297 --> 00:54:32,094
Lieutenant Twombly-Crouch
was tied with von Richthofen

542
00:54:32,217 --> 00:54:33,252
for the championship.

543
00:54:33,377 --> 00:54:35,527
- I still don't believe you.
- Neither does anybody else.

544
00:54:35,657 --> 00:54:39,969
That's what keeps old T.C. Flying,
or crashing, as the case may be.

545
00:54:40,097 --> 00:54:43,726
Nobody believes it,
including his squadron commander.

546
00:54:43,857 --> 00:54:45,688
- And who's that?
- Me.

547
00:54:56,017 --> 00:54:59,976
What was all that talk about
top-secret missions and Crepe Suzette?

548
00:55:00,977 --> 00:55:02,251
Just talk.

549
00:55:02,697 --> 00:55:04,653
You know,
I think you're some kind of a spy.

550
00:55:04,777 --> 00:55:06,335
If I told you I was?

551
00:55:06,737 --> 00:55:09,376
- I know lots of military secrets.
- Good.

552
00:55:10,457 --> 00:55:13,051
Back in a minute to pry them out of you.

553
00:55:25,577 --> 00:55:26,976
Crepe Suzette.

554
00:55:27,377 --> 00:55:28,366
What?

555
00:55:28,497 --> 00:55:30,886
That's exactly what he said.
Operation Crepe Suzette.

556
00:55:32,617 --> 00:55:35,450
- What else?
- That it's top-secret. So far, that's all.

557
00:55:35,577 --> 00:55:37,215
But he's planned a weekend
in the country

558
00:55:37,337 --> 00:55:39,771
and I'll contact you
as soon as I have the information.

559
00:55:58,577 --> 00:55:59,566
Bill?

560
00:56:02,497 --> 00:56:03,976
Major Larrabee?

561
00:57:44,257 --> 00:57:45,372
Look!

562
00:58:21,817 --> 00:58:23,045
Bonjour.

563
00:59:49,017 --> 00:59:50,166
Au revoir.

564
01:00:12,697 --> 01:00:13,812
To us.

565
01:00:17,497 --> 01:00:21,285
- Bill, do me a favour?
- Sure.

566
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:24,455
No lines, no campaign.

567
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:28,227
In the first place, it isn't necessary
and in the second place,

568
01:00:28,362 --> 01:00:31,162
I want whatever happens
this weekend to be honest.

569
01:00:32,175 --> 01:00:34,631
Since I have nothing to gain
by lying to you,

570
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:40,761
I think you're
the most provocative, exciting,

571
01:00:41,896 --> 01:00:43,503
and most desirable woman
I've ever met.

572
01:00:45,438 --> 01:00:46,467
I'll buy that.

573
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:37,961
Excuse me.

574
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:48,889
I have champagne.

575
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,413
Here. Compliments of the management.

576
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:10,949
- Will you be ordering dinner?
- No.

577
01:03:20,811 --> 01:03:21,662
I'm sorry, darling.

578
01:03:28,181 --> 01:03:28,609
Bill,

579
01:03:30,689 --> 01:03:32,557
would you excuse me just one minute?

580
01:03:33,523 --> 01:03:34,731
Be right back.

581
01:03:38,782 --> 01:03:39,442
Shan't be long.

582
01:03:50,377 --> 01:03:52,656
- Are you out of your mind?
- He lied to you.

583
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:55,437
- What?
- He didn't fly last weekend.

584
01:03:55,990 --> 01:03:57,608
There was no encounter
with von Richthofen.

585
01:03:57,783 --> 01:04:00,243
Larrabee's squadron was in the air,
but Larrabee was not.

586
01:04:00,627 --> 01:04:03,119
Moreover, we've checked every channel
and nothing at all has filtered down

587
01:04:03,236 --> 01:04:04,967
about any operation Crepe Suzette.

588
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:08,499
So, either it is even more important
than we imagined,

589
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:11,044
or it simply doesn't exist.

590
01:04:12,946 --> 01:04:15,159
- And if it doesn't?
- Then he's onto you.

591
01:04:16,771 --> 01:04:20,947
It's possible, I suppose,
but my every instinct says no.

592
01:04:21,595 --> 01:04:22,695
Then what's the alternative?

593
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:25,117
Another woman?

594
01:04:27,387 --> 01:04:31,300
It's our opinion that Major Larrabee
is giving information to a woman.

595
01:04:31,364 --> 01:04:32,701
I fly at dawn. Good night, darling.

596
01:04:32,937 --> 01:04:36,013
How did you fare
with Operation Crepe Suzette?

597
01:04:36,078 --> 01:04:37,286
He's being coerced.

598
01:04:38,306 --> 01:04:39,280
He's being seduced.

599
01:04:39,414 --> 01:04:40,542
Yes, I am a little tired.

600
01:04:40,672 --> 01:04:42,611
Operation Crepe Suzette.
Suzette. Suzette.

601
01:04:43,594 --> 01:04:44,349
Lili?

602
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:47,834
Lili?

603
01:04:59,816 --> 01:05:02,161
- Anything wrong?
- No.

604
01:05:05,481 --> 01:05:07,910
- Any more champagne?
- Plenty.

605
01:05:39,647 --> 01:05:40,332
What?

606
01:05:41,078 --> 01:05:44,748
- Darling, I'm sorry.- No, it's okay.
- It was an accident.- No, it's okay.

607
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:46,064
- I've ruined your shirt.
- Doesn't matter.

608
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:47,029
Shouldn't you change?

609
01:05:47,082 --> 01:05:48,896
What's the difference?
It's coming off in a minute anyway.

610
01:05:49,855 --> 01:05:50,355
Certainly

611
01:05:53,196 --> 01:05:53,798
What's wrong?

612
01:05:56,624 --> 01:05:57,777
I was just going to ask you.

613
01:05:58,130 --> 01:06:00,428
- Ask me what?
- What's wrong?

614
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,603
- With me?
- Yeah.

615
01:06:03,528 --> 01:06:06,781
Well nothing, darling,
but I do sense something about you.

616
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:10,298
- Me?
- It's really not important.

617
01:06:10,647 --> 01:06:12,277
Of course it's important.

618
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:16,344
The girl that went into that bedroom
is not the same girl who just walked out.

619
01:06:16,377 --> 01:06:18,233
- Rubbish.
- It's not rubbish.

620
01:06:18,267 --> 01:06:19,123
We're having our first fight.

621
01:06:19,419 --> 01:06:22,015
We are not fighting.
I'm simply trying to point out...

622
01:06:22,069 --> 01:06:22,319
Bill.

623
01:06:36,571 --> 01:06:38,687
- Carry me.
- What?

624
01:07:03,202 --> 01:07:06,249
My room.
.....My room.

625
01:07:51,032 --> 01:07:52,827
Wait a minute. I have a better idea.

626
01:08:31,584 --> 01:08:34,479
I'm sorry, darling. Really, I am.
I just can't help it.

627
01:08:38,431 --> 01:08:41,462
- Are you all right?
- What do you mean "all right"?

628
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:44,608
Come now, you've got to admit

629
01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:47,467
seduction can really be very funny
if you stop to think about it.

630
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:49,891
But you're not supposed to stop
to think about it.

631
01:08:50,020 --> 01:08:53,012
Oh, Bill, that's
a terribly naive point of view

632
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:56,291
for a man of your sophistication
and experience.

633
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:00,331
- Bill?
- Look,

634
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:03,452
- couldn't we talk about this tomorrow?
- Oh, my love.

635
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:17,130
- Damn it, Lili.
- Sorry. I really can't help it.

636
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:21,533
If you really wanted me,
it shouldn't matter anyway.

637
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:24,254
Come here.

638
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:25,654
My sweet.

639
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:28,732
My love.

640
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:33,053
What is it?

641
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:35,535
- What did you just call me?
- What?

642
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:37,213
- What did you just call me?
- When?

643
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:38,489
Think.

644
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:40,451
- What in the...
- Think! What did you just call me?

645
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:42,093
What do you mean?
How do I know what I called you?

646
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:43,289
You called me darling,

647
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:46,856
you called me your love,
and you called me something else.

648
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:48,534
I said you were wonderful.

649
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:50,651
You called me something else, a name.

650
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:52,259
A name?

651
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:53,733
- Suzette.
- What?

652
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:56,010
- You called me Suzette.
- The hell I did.

653
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:57,858
- The hell you didn't. You did.
- The hell I did.

654
01:09:57,980 --> 01:09:59,459
- Why would I call you Suzette?
- I don't know.

655
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:00,729
- Do you know a Suzette?
- No!

656
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:02,498
- You don't?
- No.

657
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:20,613
- Bill...
- Yeah?

658
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:22,214
I'm sorry.

659
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:25,135
I am.

660
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:27,699
- My pet.
- What?

661
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:30,175
"My pet. " That's what I called you.

662
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:32,018
- "My pet"?
- You're damn right.

663
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:35,132
My pet, sounds like Suzette.
Suzette, my pet. My pet, Suzette.

664
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:37,137
- That's what I called you.
- Oh.

665
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:42,694
- Now what's wrong?
- Nothing.

666
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:44,617
Don't tell me nothing.

667
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:48,619
- Did you really call me "my pet"?
- Yes.

668
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:50,776
I really called you "my pet. "

669
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:52,936
- What's the matter with that?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

670
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:54,175
Okay.

671
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:02,532
Oh, shoot.

672
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:09,608
Oh, Bill. Oh, darling.
Oh, sweet, forgive me.

673
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:13,130
I've been behaving like
an idiot schoolgirl and I'm sorry.

674
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:14,852
I adore you.

675
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:38,611
There have been others?

676
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:42,254
- Oh, my darling.
- Many?

677
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:47,699
- Bill.
- What?

678
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:50,539
- You're not being honest.
- What do you mean, not being honest?

679
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:52,935
- What about Suzette?
- Damn it to hell, Lili,

680
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:55,938
- I told you, there is no Suzette.
- Operation Crepe Suzette.

681
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:57,459
- That's not a woman.
- Then what is it?

682
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:59,491
For God's sake, Lili,
you heard T.C. The other night.

683
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:01,338
Operation Crepe Suzette
is a military secret.

684
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:02,529
That's what you said.

685
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:06,369
And that's what it is.
It's so important, I can't even tell you.

686
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:10,129
It isn't that I don't trust you.
It's just a matter of national security.

687
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:12,975
I wouldn't even tell my own mother.

688
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:19,729
All right.

689
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:21,612
You want to know
about Operation Crepe Suzette?

690
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:23,173
I'll tell you
about Operation Crepe Suzette.

691
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:24,335
I'd rather you didn't.

692
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:25,449
You're gonna hear about it anyway.

693
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:27,411
- I don't want you to break...
- The hell with security!

694
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:29,292
I want to get this straight
once and for all.

695
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:31,331
You want honesty,
you're going to get honesty,

696
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:32,973
and I could get shot for it.

697
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:36,297
I'm gonna give you every little detail
of the biggest military operation

698
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:37,819
since Battle of the Marne.

699
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:40,249
Last weekend, after I left you,

700
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:43,531
I reported to intelligence
for a top-secret briefing and it was big.

701
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:46,094
I mean, really big. Everybody was there.

702
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:49,132
D'Esperey, Hirschauer, Joffre,
all of them.

703
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:51,854
And the English brass, too.
Rawlinson, even Haig.

704
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:55,099
The Germans
were building a secret weapon so big,

705
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:58,849
so devastating, that it might have
ended the war tomorrow.

706
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:01,619
Every available squadron
was ordered into the air,

707
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:05,699
and I was to lead the attack.
The plan was to mass over Starnberg.

708
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:07,048
He lied to you.

709
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:08,374
He didn't fly last weekend.

710
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,058
There was no encounter
with von Richthofen.

711
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:12,978
It was the most concentrated bombing
effort of the war to this day.

712
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:15,330
And the code name
for the whole operation was

713
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:16,893
Crepe Suzette.

714
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:23,617
- And you led the attack?
- Yes.

715
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:28,490
Lili. Lili.

716
01:13:56,820 --> 01:13:58,890
What the hell did I do, Lili?

717
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:03,892
This is ridiculous.
At least tell me what I did wrong.

718
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:08,533
Lili!

719
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:13,009
Lili.

720
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:16,534
- Where are you going?
- I fly at dawn.

721
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:19,569
Lili!

722
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:43,375
Lili!

723
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:52,855
- Lili, now, stop it!
- I am going back to Paris.

724
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:54,572
You were going to take my car
and leave me here?

725
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:55,769
Damn right!

726
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:20,854
- Choke it.
- I'd be delighted.

727
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:45,212
Swine! Egomaniac!

728
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:49,335
Lili!

729
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:51,653
Open this door!

730
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:56,095
I'm warning you, Lili,
if you don't open this door,

731
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:57,938
I'm gonna break it down.

732
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:05,095
Lili!

733
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:09,178
- Where is she?
- I think she is in her room, sir.

734
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:16,650
Damn it, woman, we're going
to settle this once and for all.

735
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:18,778
- Get out of here!
- Not until we settle this.

736
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:20,731
- There's nothing to settle.
- The hell there isn't!

737
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:22,498
- Go settle it with Suzette.
- Suzette, my foot.

738
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:25,054
Suzette, my crepe.
Get out of my shower!

739
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:28,456
- What are you doing?
- Now, let's have it.

740
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:33,173
You bastard!

741
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:38,340
- You going to tell me?
- Yes.

742
01:17:42,020 --> 01:17:43,419
- Generals Haig and...
- Rawlinson?

743
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:44,859
What about Generals Haig
and Rawlinson?

744
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:46,129
They were having dinner with me

745
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:47,898
the night they were supposed
to be briefing you.

746
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:50,056
Why didn't you say so in the first place?

747
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:52,250
So I'm a liar.
What would you rather I be, a traitor?

748
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:54,257
- What?
- You heard me, I said traitor.

749
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:55,813
The lives of hundreds,
thousands of men

750
01:17:55,940 --> 01:17:57,771
depend upon Operation Crepe Suzette

751
01:17:57,900 --> 01:17:59,128
being kept a secret.

752
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:01,251
What in the name of hellish vanity
makes you think

753
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:04,417
I'd compromise that in the name
of your adolescent, narcissistic ego?

754
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:06,895
- My ego?
- Sure, I lied to you. I had to.

755
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:09,250
You know what?
I think you're glad you caught me lying.

756
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:10,654
- Rubbish.
- It is?

757
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:12,850
I think maybe you have
to come up with excuses

758
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:14,777
- just to avoid the moment of truth.
- What?

759
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:18,859
In a word, Miss Smith,
I think it's just possible you're a virgin.

760
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:36,492
- Bill?
- Yeah?

761
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:39,292
Turn on the warm water.

762
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:47,332
Get off! Boches!

763
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:16,688
Gentlemen.

764
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:18,613
Mademoiselle Smith.

765
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:21,333
Do sit down.

766
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:32,173
We have come to speak to you again
about Major Larrabee.

767
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:33,415
Yes?

768
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:37,658
Since last we met,
certain new evidence has come to light.

769
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:41,653
And now we believe
we know the identity of the person

770
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:45,090
to whom Major Larrabee
has been passing information.

771
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:49,852
She's a well-known entertainer.

772
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:53,093
Really?

773
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:55,780
Her name is Suzette Maldue.

774
01:23:58,140 --> 01:24:00,813
- Who?
- Perhaps you've heard of her.

775
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:03,170
She's known as Crepe Suzette.

776
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:18,013
Your Good-Will Ambassador

777
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:22,019
Would like to know
Are you doing okay

778
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:27,653
Your Good-Will Ambassador

779
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:32,336
Would like to feel
You're enjoying your stay

780
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:37,339
If you're calm and placid or

781
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:42,136
if you've a red hot desire to roam

782
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:46,936
I want to get you all to know Paree

783
01:24:47,060 --> 01:24:51,895
For there's a fast Paree
And there's a slow Paree

784
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:56,571
We'll do the whole big, sexy potpourri

785
01:24:56,700 --> 01:25:00,932
'Cause baby
I'm going to make you at home

786
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:44,575
We'll do the whole big, sexy potpourri

787
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:48,090
'Cause baby
I'm going to make you at home

788
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:53,010
Or on the Left Bank
I'm going to make you at home

789
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:55,176
Or on the Right Bank

790
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:58,975
I'm going to make you

791
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:02,092
at home

792
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:13,930
That filthy, scheming, cheating, faking,

793
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:17,530
lying, egotistic, self-indulgent,
hedonistic, son of a...

794
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:26,339
Think we can do it?

795
01:26:26,460 --> 01:26:29,577
Yes, but you had better fly,
'cause I haven't been drinking.

796
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:11,699
Halt!

797
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:14,973
Wait for me!

798
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:16,819
Wait a minute!

799
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:38,256
Just a minute. Where are you going?

800
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:16,696
I'll give you three guesses

801
01:29:16,820 --> 01:29:19,288
Who loves you

802
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:25,653
Who's loved you
Right from the start

803
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:29,811
Not your mother

804
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:34,092
Who likes to baby you so

805
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:37,496
And not the girl back home

806
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:41,693
You used to know

807
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:44,689
Oh, no

808
01:29:44,820 --> 01:29:48,779
There's somebody special

809
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:51,848
Who needs you

810
01:29:53,540 --> 01:29:56,373
Together

811
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:59,810
or apart

812
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:40,255
Bet you don't need three guesses

813
01:30:40,380 --> 01:30:44,339
And not even two

814
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:48,089
To know that I'm the one

815
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:55,011
Sweetheart

816
01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:06,211
Are you absolutely sure?

817
01:31:06,340 --> 01:31:09,138
You can see her any night at that place,
all of her.

818
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:13,139
- How fascinating. I'll look into it.
- Yes, I thought you'd want to do that.

819
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:15,694
You can take my word for it
that Operation Crepe Suzette

820
01:31:15,820 --> 01:31:20,530
has never existed, except in bed.
And no doubt he's operating right now.

821
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:22,093
You sound jealous.

822
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:24,613
Don't be an ass.

823
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:50,890
And how was everything at the front?

824
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:53,215
Fine.

825
01:31:54,020 --> 01:31:55,089
Fine.

826
01:32:00,620 --> 01:32:02,690
- Hurt yourself?
- No, it's nothing.

827
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:09,172
- Just a flesh wound.
- It's nothing serious.

828
01:32:10,260 --> 01:32:13,889
- Was it the Baron again?
- No.

829
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:16,409
This time, believe it or not,

830
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:19,250
I happened to be up in a German plane.

831
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:25,970
"Believe it or not. " Well, well.
Why don't you tell me all about it?

832
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:29,734
Lili...

833
01:32:30,780 --> 01:32:32,771
- What's up?
- Up?

834
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:37,416
- Funny you should mention that.
- What?

835
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:39,414
You were...

836
01:32:39,980 --> 01:32:43,495
You were up. In the air, so to speak.

837
01:32:43,820 --> 01:32:46,050
- Sort of a pun.
- A pun?

838
01:32:47,380 --> 01:32:49,894
Darling, I'm sorry. I'm not myself today.

839
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:51,373
I've been worried to death about you,

840
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:53,855
and then you come in
limping on that thing,

841
01:32:53,980 --> 01:32:56,016
and you must admit
that under the circumstances,

842
01:32:56,140 --> 01:33:00,019
it's a bit difficult to be reasonable
and calm.

843
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:02,409
You...

844
01:33:03,260 --> 01:33:05,615
You really worried about me?

845
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:08,698
Come on, now. Tell me all about it.

846
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:14,735
We did run into the Baron.

847
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:18,136
- T.C. Got shot down.
- No.

848
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:20,820
- He's all right.
- Thank God.

849
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:23,539
I managed to land nearby,

850
01:33:23,660 --> 01:33:26,936
but before I could find T. C.,
the Germans found me.

851
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:29,290
- You were behind enemy lines.
- Yeah.

852
01:33:29,420 --> 01:33:31,331
- How frightful.
- Yeah.

853
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:35,813
- I had to burn my plane.
- That sweet little plane?

854
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:40,098
I had no choice.
A lucky shot put my plane out of action.

855
01:33:40,220 --> 01:33:42,939
- I had to make a run for it.
- All the way to France?

856
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:45,213
No, I mean...

857
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:48,450
We did have to cover
quite a bit of territory.

858
01:33:48,580 --> 01:33:51,378
- We?
- T.C. And I.

859
01:33:51,780 --> 01:33:54,340
- You found him again.
- Yeah.

860
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:56,655
And yesterday morning
we stumbled on a German airfield

861
01:33:56,780 --> 01:33:58,896
and we stole von Richthofen's plane.

862
01:34:02,780 --> 01:34:05,897
You must be exhausted.

863
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:08,374
A little.

864
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:17,095
What?

865
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:21,615
Did you really steal
von Richthofen's plane?

866
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:22,889
Yes.

867
01:34:24,260 --> 01:34:26,933
In a pig's eye, you did.

868
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:29,936
Lili! Lili!

869
01:34:31,060 --> 01:34:32,732
Lili, open this door!

870
01:34:34,220 --> 01:34:35,335
Lili!

871
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:36,734
- Yes!
- Lili?

872
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:38,009
Yes.

873
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:41,894
Unfortunately, your friend, the Major,
has borrowed the Baron's plane.

874
01:34:42,020 --> 01:34:43,089
Lili!

875
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:47,890
You mean, he really did steal
von Richthofen's plane?

876
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:50,249
Lili?

877
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:55,698
- Bill! Bill!
- No.

878
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:58,732
- Darling, it must've been awful.
- Damn it to hell, Lili.

879
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:00,179
- Come on, lean on me.
- No, wait.

880
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:02,495
- Please don't scold.
- I'm not going to scold.

881
01:35:02,620 --> 01:35:04,497
- I just want to get things straight.
- But I believe you.

882
01:35:04,620 --> 01:35:05,894
- No, you don't.
- I do.

883
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:08,170
How do I know? You're not dependable
about these things.

884
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:10,291
I promise, I swear,
I'll never ever doubt you again.

885
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:11,694
- Yes, you will.
- I won't.

886
01:35:11,820 --> 01:35:13,776
- I don't trust you.
- But I believe, honestly.

887
01:35:13,900 --> 01:35:15,936
Come on, let's get you off your feet.
I'm sorry.

888
01:35:16,060 --> 01:35:17,209
No. No, Lili.

889
01:35:18,020 --> 01:35:20,011
- I can't stay.
- You can't?

890
01:35:20,140 --> 01:35:23,496
There's something important
I've got to take care of.

891
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:26,139
- Right now?
- Right now.

892
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:29,136
- This minute?
- It can't wait.

893
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:32,129
Lili,

894
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:35,699
- do you believe?
- Of course, I believe it.

895
01:35:35,820 --> 01:35:38,573
But what in the world
could be so important that...

896
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:41,179
Do you believe?

897
01:35:47,740 --> 01:35:49,890
- I believe.
- Okay.

898
01:35:50,020 --> 01:35:51,851
- See you soon.
- How soon?

899
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:54,576
Just as soon as I can make it.

900
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:03,768
I believe.

901
01:36:13,860 --> 01:36:16,328
Bedford, get the car!

902
01:36:33,180 --> 01:36:34,932
Should I follow them?

903
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:37,335
No.

904
01:36:39,740 --> 01:36:41,970
Take this and put it under her mattress.

905
01:36:43,740 --> 01:36:44,855
That's our codebook.

906
01:36:44,980 --> 01:36:47,096
When they've been arrested
we'll change the code, now move!

907
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:54,129
- Capitaine Duvalle.
- Captain Duvalle, this is Lili Smith.

908
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:55,852
Mademoiselle Smith.

909
01:36:55,980 --> 01:36:58,016
You know how I've resisted
your allegations

910
01:36:58,140 --> 01:36:59,858
concerning Major Larrabee.

911
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:03,817
Well, there is something
I now feel I must tell you.

912
01:37:05,980 --> 01:37:09,529
Major Larrabee has said several things
which make it absolutely clear

913
01:37:09,660 --> 01:37:12,891
that he is indeed passing
important military information

914
01:37:13,020 --> 01:37:17,138
to this... This Suzette.

915
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:46,730
- Major Larrabee?
- Yes.

916
01:37:46,860 --> 01:37:48,691
- Suzette Maldue?
- Oui.

917
01:37:48,820 --> 01:37:51,414
I am Captain Duvalle
of army intelligence.

918
01:37:51,540 --> 01:37:52,529
Yes.

919
01:37:52,660 --> 01:37:54,855
I must regrettably inform you,
and you, Miss Maldue,

920
01:37:54,980 --> 01:37:56,538
that you are both under arrest.

921
01:37:56,660 --> 01:37:57,729
- Under arrest?
- What for?

922
01:37:57,860 --> 01:37:59,612
High treason.

923
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:02,857
- What in the hell are you talking about?
- Please, Major.

924
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:07,692
"According to Captain Duvalle
of French army intelligence

925
01:38:07,820 --> 01:38:10,175
"a search of Miss Maldue's lodgings

926
01:38:10,300 --> 01:38:13,736
"turned up vital
and damaging evidence. "

927
01:38:19,220 --> 01:38:21,575
You realise what this means, Lili?

928
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:24,897
- You can change the code.
- It's been changed already.

929
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:26,772
It's not so easy
to replace Major Larrabee.

930
01:38:26,900 --> 01:38:29,255
Would it have been easier
to replace me?

931
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:31,937
Captain Duvalle
was suspicious of Suzette,

932
01:38:32,060 --> 01:38:34,415
but sooner or later,
he was bound to discover the truth,

933
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:36,417
unless he had positive evidence
against her.

934
01:38:36,540 --> 01:38:39,737
I decided to protect myself
by providing him with that evidence.

935
01:38:39,860 --> 01:38:43,011
- And eliminate a rival.
- Don't be an ass.

936
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:45,051
That's the second time
you've called me that.

937
01:38:45,180 --> 01:38:46,499
Really?

938
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:47,814
The first time was when I suggested

939
01:38:47,940 --> 01:38:51,012
that you might be becoming
emotionally involved.

940
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:53,297
Yes, I remember.

941
01:38:53,420 --> 01:38:56,059
And the second time
was when I suggested

942
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:58,740
that you might be becoming
emotionally involved.

943
01:38:59,380 --> 01:39:01,689
Lili, surely you must've known
that by implicating Suzette

944
01:39:01,820 --> 01:39:04,618
you could not help
but implicate the Major.

945
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:08,615
Do you really love him so much?

946
01:39:15,260 --> 01:39:18,491
Here we are.
Try to look reasonably happy.

947
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:20,975
After all,
it isn't every day that a German spy

948
01:39:21,100 --> 01:39:23,250
is awarded
the French Legion of Honour.

949
01:39:39,180 --> 01:39:42,138
Of course
I had an affair with Major Larrabee.

950
01:39:42,260 --> 01:39:45,491
But, he only took me out
to tell me it was finished

951
01:39:45,620 --> 01:39:48,214
and that he was in love with Lili Smith.

952
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:56,056
We would like to believe you, but...

953
01:40:00,580 --> 01:40:04,209
Until such time
as the court-martial is convened,

954
01:40:04,340 --> 01:40:08,458
you are under military arrest. And
you will be confined to your quarters.

955
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:09,808
Dismissed.

956
01:41:41,820 --> 01:41:45,574
My dear, don't worry.
Have a good journey. Enjoy your rest.

957
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:48,814
I'll probably pay you a visit
sometime next month

958
01:41:48,940 --> 01:41:51,215
to discuss the future.

959
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:52,739
Goodbye, Kurt.

960
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:22,615
Come in, and close the door.

961
01:42:22,740 --> 01:42:25,129
I have an important message for you

962
01:42:25,620 --> 01:42:27,815
from your friend, the Kaiser.

963
01:42:29,460 --> 01:42:32,452
I gather I'm no longer
in His Majesty's good graces.

964
01:42:32,580 --> 01:42:34,571
How did you guess?

965
01:42:34,700 --> 01:42:37,897
Because you would naturally choose
to deliver such a message yourself,

966
01:42:38,020 --> 01:42:40,898
and it's the first time
I've ever seen you look happy.

967
01:42:41,820 --> 01:42:46,530
I recall once when I was in Africa
watching a jackal devouring a kill,

968
01:42:47,020 --> 01:42:49,818
it had a similar look on its face.

969
01:42:52,540 --> 01:42:56,419
I'm under orders to take you back
to Germany to face a court-martial.

970
01:42:56,540 --> 01:42:57,893
But don't think for a moment

971
01:42:58,020 --> 01:43:02,013
that I wouldn't be just as pleased
to turn in a report that you refused to go.

972
01:43:02,420 --> 01:43:04,854
And were shot trying to escape.

973
01:43:04,980 --> 01:43:08,859
Shot by you, General,
or by your hatchet man, Kraus?

974
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:11,860
By the way, where is Kraus?

975
01:43:13,100 --> 01:43:16,137
Taking care
of some last-minute business.

976
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:44,769
- Tea, Miss Lili?
- Yes.

977
01:43:44,900 --> 01:43:47,095
And we'd better start packing.

978
01:43:48,860 --> 01:43:51,454
- Have you seen the evening paper?
- No.

979
01:43:56,700 --> 01:43:59,339
Don't let her see this.
If she asks, make an excuse.

980
01:43:59,460 --> 01:44:02,611
- But after all she's been through.
- She's been through too much.

981
01:44:02,740 --> 01:44:04,731
If she sees this,
there's no telling what'll happen.

982
01:44:04,860 --> 01:44:08,933
- But she loves him and she's miserable.
- And it's too late to do anything about it.

983
01:44:09,060 --> 01:44:11,494
We're only one step
ahead of a firing squad, as it is.

984
01:44:11,620 --> 01:44:14,692
Now don't you start getting sentimental
and muck things up.

985
01:44:48,140 --> 01:44:50,938
Would it make any difference
if he loved you?

986
01:44:54,020 --> 01:44:55,339
According to the evening paper,

987
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:58,691
Suzette Maldue claimed
she knew nothing about the codebook

988
01:44:58,820 --> 01:45:01,175
and that Major Larrabee
only took her out that afternoon

989
01:45:01,300 --> 01:45:04,133
to tell her
he was in love with another woman.

990
01:45:08,180 --> 01:45:10,057
According to the evening paper.

991
01:45:13,660 --> 01:45:16,254
- Where is it?
- Bedford didn't want you to see it.

992
01:45:16,380 --> 01:45:18,769
He was afraid
you might do something foolish.

993
01:45:52,820 --> 01:45:53,775
No.

994
01:45:57,220 --> 01:45:58,892
That should be Kraus.

995
01:46:02,780 --> 01:46:03,895
Hello?

996
01:46:07,660 --> 01:46:08,809
That wasn't the Colonel.

997
01:46:08,940 --> 01:46:10,771
- What should we do?
- Pack.

998
01:46:52,060 --> 01:46:53,049
Yes?

999
01:46:53,180 --> 01:46:55,410
I followed her
to the French Intelligence Headquarters.

1000
01:46:55,540 --> 01:46:57,178
Eliminate her.

1001
01:46:57,300 --> 01:47:01,054
The moment she sets foot
outside of that building,

1002
01:47:01,180 --> 01:47:02,295
get her.

1003
01:47:10,180 --> 01:47:11,408
Schnell.

1004
01:47:16,540 --> 01:47:19,259
- I have a taxi.
- No, we'll take my car.

1005
01:47:19,380 --> 01:47:20,699
Hey!

1006
01:47:21,980 --> 01:47:23,777
Hey, what are you trying to do?

1007
01:47:38,420 --> 01:47:39,899
Follow that car.

1008
01:47:43,100 --> 01:47:44,738
I am a German spy.

1009
01:47:49,460 --> 01:47:51,849
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Yes.

1010
01:47:51,980 --> 01:47:55,814
Yes, I understand what you are saying.
I also understand

1011
01:47:55,940 --> 01:47:57,692
why you are saying it.

1012
01:47:58,060 --> 01:47:59,539
Major Larrabee is innocent.

1013
01:47:59,660 --> 01:48:00,775
I was the one who had the codebook

1014
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:03,414
planted under
what's-her-name's mattress.

1015
01:48:03,540 --> 01:48:05,576
I have come to make a full confession.

1016
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:09,739
Mademoiselle Smith,
it's a wonderful, romantic gesture.

1017
01:48:09,860 --> 01:48:11,816
And as a Frenchman

1018
01:48:11,940 --> 01:48:14,818
I appreciate everything
that you are trying to do, but...

1019
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:17,979
Yes, what is it?

1020
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:23,769
How does she know that the codebook
was under the mattress?

1021
01:48:24,780 --> 01:48:28,329
How do I know how she knew that
the codebook was under the mattress?

1022
01:48:28,700 --> 01:48:30,372
You must forgive him.

1023
01:48:34,620 --> 01:48:37,498
How did you know that the codebook
was under the mattress?

1024
01:48:55,980 --> 01:48:58,255
Gentlemen. Lili, let's go.

1025
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:01,574
Let's run.

1026
01:49:15,580 --> 01:49:17,298
It's no good, Kurt.
I told them, I confessed.

1027
01:49:17,420 --> 01:49:19,934
I didn't implicate you or any of
the others but they know about me.

1028
01:49:20,060 --> 01:49:21,413
You're bleeding,
you should see a doctor.

1029
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:24,259
- Bedford, drive to Dr Rene's house.
- We are not going to Dr Rene's house.

1030
01:49:24,380 --> 01:49:27,019
- But you must get this seen to.
- We are going to the railway station.

1031
01:49:27,140 --> 01:49:29,131
- Railway station?
- And then we're going to Switzerland.

1032
01:49:29,260 --> 01:49:32,093
Switzerland? You can go to Switzerland,
but I can't go.

1033
01:49:32,220 --> 01:49:34,859
I told them, they know about me.
I wasn't joking. I told them.

1034
01:49:34,980 --> 01:49:36,698
- I'm sure you did.
- What if you're seen with me?

1035
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:37,855
- May I please say something?
- What?

1036
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:39,538
For someone who's always been
the personification

1037
01:49:39,660 --> 01:49:41,378
of quick-wittedness
and indefectible judgement,

1038
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:44,651
you're suddenly making decisions with
all the cunning of a headless chicken.

1039
01:49:44,780 --> 01:49:45,815
What do you mean?

1040
01:49:45,940 --> 01:49:47,896
Look, you confessed
in order to save Major Larrabee.

1041
01:49:48,020 --> 01:49:50,090
- Yes.
- Because he is innocent.

1042
01:49:50,220 --> 01:49:51,733
- Yes.
- Is he?

1043
01:49:51,860 --> 01:49:54,249
Don't be an ass.
He didn't tell that woman a thing.

1044
01:49:54,380 --> 01:49:56,575
- Which woman?
- Suzette. She's not a spy.

1045
01:49:56,700 --> 01:49:58,372
- But he told you.
- Of course he did.

1046
01:49:58,500 --> 01:50:02,254
And you are a spy.
And Suzette, who is not,

1047
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:04,132
has a good chance of proving
that she is not,

1048
01:50:04,260 --> 01:50:06,410
thereby exonerating the Major.
Because without the real spy

1049
01:50:06,540 --> 01:50:10,453
the government has no case.
But now, my dear, they have.

1050
01:50:10,580 --> 01:50:12,491
Oh, my God.

1051
01:50:13,780 --> 01:50:16,374
And so you have no alternative.
If you stay and are convicted,

1052
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:18,411
the Major will undoubtedly face
a court-martial,

1053
01:50:18,540 --> 01:50:20,974
but if you can escape to Switzerland
and remain there incommunicado

1054
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:24,092
until the appropriate time,
you might just save us all.

1055
01:50:25,700 --> 01:50:27,770
How could I have been such an idiot?

1056
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:17,655
Here.

1057
01:52:21,900 --> 01:52:23,777
I'm going to cover you up with this.

1058
01:52:23,900 --> 01:52:26,050
Try to sit quietly,
and don't move around too much.

1059
01:52:26,180 --> 01:52:28,330
- Yes, nurse.
- Don't be patronising.

1060
01:52:28,460 --> 01:52:29,973
Put your feet up.

1061
01:52:58,300 --> 01:53:00,256
The best thing for us will be to hide
at the farm for a few days

1062
01:53:00,380 --> 01:53:03,417
- before we try Switzerland.
- What about the Colonel and Miss Lili?

1063
01:53:03,540 --> 01:53:07,249
If there's no trouble,
they'll be across the border by morning.

1064
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:20,617
Don't be unhappy, darling,
because there's a good possibility

1065
01:53:20,740 --> 01:53:23,208
the fighting will be over
before too very long,

1066
01:53:23,340 --> 01:53:24,693
and then,

1067
01:53:24,820 --> 01:53:28,893
if he really loves you,
he'll find you, wherever you are.

1068
01:53:29,660 --> 01:53:33,858
He'd be better off if he didn't.
I always seem to mess things up.

1069
01:53:36,180 --> 01:53:38,853
I tried to put it all right,
and it all went wrong.

1070
01:53:42,580 --> 01:53:45,652
I wanted so to justify
your confidence in me.

1071
01:53:45,780 --> 01:53:48,977
I've always admired you and loved you

1072
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:51,455
and respected you, and what happens?

1073
01:53:51,580 --> 01:53:54,333
He gets court-martialled,
and you get shot,

1074
01:53:54,460 --> 01:53:57,497
and here I am on this wretched train
going to Switzerland.

1075
01:53:58,380 --> 01:54:01,019
Well, we have one consolation,

1076
01:54:01,140 --> 01:54:03,096
things can't get much worse.

1077
01:54:08,460 --> 01:54:10,257
You think it's funny?

1078
01:54:11,420 --> 01:54:14,537
Lili Smith tells you she's a German spy

1079
01:54:14,660 --> 01:54:16,935
and you don't think it's funny?

1080
01:54:17,740 --> 01:54:21,369
I admit that at first,
it did seem somewhat implausible.

1081
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:22,535
Implausible?

1082
01:54:22,660 --> 01:54:26,335
At first I thought it nothing more
than an attempt to exonerate you.

1083
01:54:26,460 --> 01:54:28,132
But she was in possession
of certain facts.

1084
01:54:28,260 --> 01:54:29,295
Gentlemen,

1085
01:54:29,420 --> 01:54:32,492
- Lili's an actress.
- Of course, I considered that,

1086
01:54:32,620 --> 01:54:35,771
- but when she was kidnapped...
- Kidnapped?

1087
01:54:35,900 --> 01:54:38,858
- Yes, it seemed...
- Did you say kidnapped?

1088
01:54:38,980 --> 01:54:42,177
Yes. We were bringing her to see you
to confront you with the evidence.

1089
01:54:42,300 --> 01:54:43,619
- Who kidnapped her?
- We've no idea.

1090
01:54:43,740 --> 01:54:45,093
- Major, please. I must insist.
- Shut up.

1091
01:54:45,220 --> 01:54:48,337
A man jumped out of the car,
there were some shots and poof!

1092
01:54:48,460 --> 01:54:50,257
- What do you mean "poof"?
- She was gone.

1093
01:54:50,380 --> 01:54:51,529
Captain Duvalle's best suit.

1094
01:54:51,660 --> 01:54:54,015
- What did you do about it?
- Why, we came to see you.

1095
01:54:54,140 --> 01:54:56,973
We thought perhaps you might
shed some light on the matter.

1096
01:55:21,540 --> 01:55:23,178
This is the bathroom.

1097
01:55:24,140 --> 01:55:25,209
Yep.

1098
01:55:34,340 --> 01:55:35,455
Major?

1099
01:56:00,620 --> 01:56:02,815
- Let's go, T.C.
- Just a moment.

1100
01:56:03,860 --> 01:56:05,737
No, do you speak English?

1101
01:56:05,860 --> 01:56:08,738
No, you don't speak English.
Don't worry about it.

1102
01:56:11,940 --> 01:56:14,010
- Sue. What's "sue"?
- Drunk.

1103
01:56:14,180 --> 01:56:17,695
Drunk. No, don't worry about it.

1104
01:56:17,820 --> 01:56:21,369
- Let's go, T.C.
- There you are, old cock.

1105
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:23,411
Just a minute, garçon.

1106
01:56:49,540 --> 01:56:51,770
- Why don't you shoot?
- He can't.

1107
01:56:52,140 --> 01:56:54,734
He doesn't have
the necessary authority.

1108
01:56:56,100 --> 01:56:59,092
He was doing pretty well
earlier this evening.

1109
01:56:59,220 --> 01:57:01,336
Herr Kraus is not trying to kill me.

1110
01:57:01,460 --> 01:57:05,339
He has orders only to eliminate you,
but he cannot do that now.

1111
01:57:06,780 --> 01:57:07,895
Why not?

1112
01:57:08,460 --> 01:57:13,170
Because he knows that if he shoots you,
he will most certainly have to kill me.

1113
01:57:15,820 --> 01:57:18,812
- Don't underestimate me, Colonel.
- I don't think I do.

1114
01:57:21,180 --> 01:57:24,695
Killing me without proper orders
could lead to a firing squad

1115
01:57:24,820 --> 01:57:27,653
or, at the very least,
a general court martial.

1116
01:57:28,220 --> 01:57:30,051
Shortly before we reach Switzerland,

1117
01:57:30,180 --> 01:57:32,489
I shall stop this train,
and we shall get off.

1118
01:57:32,620 --> 01:57:35,930
Then it is only a few hundred yards
from the German border.

1119
01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:38,895
Make yourself comfortable, my dear.

1120
01:57:39,340 --> 01:57:42,810
Try to relax.
We have several hours to go, yet.

1121
01:57:42,940 --> 01:57:45,329
- Unless I am provoked.
- Of course.

1122
01:57:51,900 --> 01:57:53,652
But why are we going to her house?

1123
01:57:53,780 --> 01:57:55,975
Because if she's a spy,
there is a very good chance

1124
01:57:56,100 --> 01:57:58,898
that the butler and the maid
are in league with her.

1125
01:57:59,020 --> 01:58:01,773
- But why are we taking this road?
- Don't be an idiot.

1126
01:58:01,900 --> 01:58:05,859
We must take them by surprise,
so we must enter by the back way.

1127
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:14,569
Hello!

1128
01:58:17,380 --> 01:58:18,779
Anybody here?

1129
01:58:24,020 --> 01:58:25,692
- Hello!
- Hello!

1130
01:58:30,780 --> 01:58:31,974
Hey!

1131
01:58:47,220 --> 01:58:49,017
I can't take you any place.

1132
01:58:50,340 --> 01:58:53,650
He forced me to order von Richthofen's
squadron to attack the train at dawn

1133
01:58:53,780 --> 01:58:57,250
before it reaches the Swiss border.
Then he wrecked the transmitter.

1134
02:00:55,900 --> 02:00:57,015
Look.

1135
02:05:25,180 --> 02:05:28,013
Often I think

1136
02:05:28,140 --> 02:05:31,177
this sad old world

1137
02:05:31,300 --> 02:05:36,977
is whistling in the dark

1138
02:05:38,740 --> 02:05:41,254
Just like a child

1139
02:05:41,380 --> 02:05:44,850
who, late from school

1140
02:05:44,980 --> 02:05:47,540
walks bravely home

1141
02:05:47,660 --> 02:05:51,369
through the park

1142
02:05:51,860 --> 02:05:56,615
To keep their spirits soaring

1143
02:05:58,580 --> 02:06:04,769
and keep the night at bay

1144
02:06:04,940 --> 02:06:07,898
Neither quite knowing

1145
02:06:08,020 --> 02:06:11,535
which way they are going

1146
02:06:11,660 --> 02:06:17,371
they sing the shadows away

1147
02:06:21,060 --> 02:06:23,938
Often I think

1148
02:06:24,060 --> 02:06:27,848
my poor old heart

1149
02:06:27,980 --> 02:06:30,739
has given up for good

1150
02:06:30,774 --> 02:06:33,498
has given up for good

1151
02:06:35,180 --> 02:06:37,933
And then I see

1152
02:06:38,060 --> 02:06:41,530
a brand new face

1153
02:06:41,660 --> 02:06:46,370
I glimpse some new neighbourhood

1154
02:06:48,300 --> 02:06:51,736
So walk me back home

1155
02:06:51,860 --> 02:06:55,694
my darling

1156
02:06:55,820 --> 02:07:01,531
tell me dreams really come true

1157
02:07:04,460 --> 02:07:07,179
Whistling

1158
02:07:09,100 --> 02:07:11,819
whistling

1159
02:07:14,100 --> 02:07:18,855
here in the dark

1160
02:07:19,340 --> 02:07:23,094
with you

1161
02:07:52,460 --> 02:07:56,533
So walk me back home

1162
02:07:56,660 --> 02:08:00,733
my darling

1163
02:08:00,860 --> 02:08:05,570
tell me dreams really come true

1164
02:08:09,740 --> 02:08:14,370
Whistling

1165
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:18,971
whistling

1166
02:08:19,860 --> 02:08:24,615
here in the dark

1167
02:08:26,820 --> 02:08:31,575
with you

1168
02:08:57,660 --> 02:09:00,970
It's a long way to Tipperary

1169
02:09:01,100 --> 02:09:05,571
It's a long way to go

1170
02:09:05,700 --> 02:09:10,137
It's a long way to Tipperary

1171
02:09:10,260 --> 02:09:15,015
To the sweetest girl I know

1172
02:09:15,140 --> 02:09:19,292
Goodbye, Piccadilly

1173
02:09:19,420 --> 02:09:23,254
Farewell, Leicester Square

1174
02:09:23,380 --> 02:09:27,692
It's a long, long way to Tipperary

1175

Subtitle by Arif chandio

1176
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:36,120
The End

1177
02:09:36,121 --> 02:09:37,321
The End

1178
02:09:27,820 --> 02:09:31,699
But my heart's right there
