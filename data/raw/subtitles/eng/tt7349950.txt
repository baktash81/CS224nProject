Stuff like that is

we can always
move back here.

I don't care.
New York, Derry, whatever. It's...

I don't have
to say anything.

91
00:04:14,127 --> 00:04:16,163
Take off that fucking hat.

92
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,098
- Oh, God.
- Come on, let's go.

93
00:04:18,165 --> 00:04:19,900
[Webby] Wouldn't want to
give people the impression

94
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:21,635

I'll take off the hat
for you.

98
00:04:27,474 --> 00:04:29,042
But why leave it there?

99
00:04:29,109 --> 00:04:30,510
Anything else

100
00:04:30,577 --> 00:04:32,246

00:09:27,137 --> 00:09:28,640
Hey, hey.
You a crewmember?

182
00:09:28,706 --> 00:09:30,307
I'm the writer.

183
00:09:30,374 --> 00:09:32,443
[construction noises]

184
00:09:39,884 --> 00:09:41,418
[assistant whispers]
Your husband's here.

185
00:09:41,486 --> 00:09:43,555
Hey!
Do you have the pages?

186
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:46,123
[woman] Everyone,
keep clear of the crane.

187
00:09:46,189 --> 00:09:49,894
My friend,
a film needs an ending.

188
00:09:49,961 --> 00:09:51,663
- You do know that, right?
- Oh, yeah.

189
00:09:51,729 --> 00:09:53,731
You said that
you needed another day

190
00:09:53,798 --> 00:09:55,165
to finish the pages,

191
00:09:55,232 --> 00:09:56,199
and we're shooting this thing.
It's tonight.

192
00:09:56,266 --> 00:09:57,301
That's, like, 17 hours...

193
00:09:57,367 --> 00:09:58,602
Everybody, calm down, okay?

194
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,737
I'm calm.

195
00:09:59,804 --> 00:10:01,572
I want you to be
happy with the movie.

196
00:10:01,638 --> 00:10:03,373
You understand?
I'm on your side.

197
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,242
That's great.
'Cause in my book, the ending...

198
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:06,811
Is terrible.

199
00:10:06,878 --> 00:10:09,646
All due respect,
people loved your book. Loved.

200
00:10:09,714 --> 00:10:11,181
They hated the ending.

201
00:10:11,248 --> 00:10:12,951
You said
you liked the ending.

202
00:10:13,017 --> 00:10:14,451
That was a lie.

203
00:10:14,518 --> 00:10:16,653
- We gotta do better, okay?
- Yeah.

204
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,656
Audra, you have my notes.
Would you...

205
00:10:19,723 --> 00:10:22,626
Okay, thank you very much.
Take me back to one, please.

206
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:23,928
Bye.

207
00:10:23,995 --> 00:10:25,997
You have his notes?

208
00:10:26,064 --> 00:10:27,999
He's not wrong.

209
00:10:28,066 --> 00:10:29,733
You hate my endings, too?

210
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,201
Not all your endings.

211
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:32,336
But this...

212
00:10:32,402 --> 00:10:34,404
- Okay.
- Just...

213
00:10:34,471 --> 00:10:36,740
What? Do you want me
to keep lying to you

214
00:10:36,807 --> 00:10:38,909
- just because I'm your wife?
- You're my wife?

215
00:10:38,977 --> 00:10:40,477
No. No.
But you know what?

216
00:10:40,544 --> 00:10:42,412
You've been blowing smoke
up my ass for eight years?

217
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:43,814
I guess I thought
you were someone else.

218
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,617
I have not been
blowing smoke up your ass.

219
00:10:46,683 --> 00:10:48,819
Everybody wants
a happy ending.

220
00:10:48,885 --> 00:10:50,220
Everybody wants closure.

221
00:10:50,287 --> 00:10:51,888
But that's not
the way life works out.

222
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:54,291
I think what Peter wants
and what the studio wants...

223
00:10:54,358 --> 00:10:56,793
The studio?
When'd you become a company man?

224
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,328
Jesus, you're an artist.

225
00:10:58,395 --> 00:10:59,796
Come on.
What's wrong with just doing it

226
00:10:59,863 --> 00:11:01,598
the way it's written?
The way I wanted.

227
00:11:01,665 --> 00:11:02,799
What's wrong with being
the woman I want you to be?

228
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,102
Fuck you, Bill.

229
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:08,238
[stammering] On the page.
The part, I mean. Not you.

230
00:11:08,305 --> 00:11:09,673
- [cell phone ringing]
- [sighs]

231
00:11:15,612 --> 00:11:16,580
Hello?

<i>Bill Denbrough?
It's Mike.</i>

233
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:20,550
Mike who?

234
00:11:21,618 --> 00:11:23,453
Mike Hanlon.

235
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,422
- <i>From Derry.</i>
- [groaning]

236
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:34,330
You need to come home.

[Myra on phone] <i>Eddie,
I keep telling you</i>

<i>not to scare me
like this.</i>

00:11:43,406 --> 00:11:44,641
<i>And you never
listen to me.</i>

242
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,143
All right. Myra, please.
Not now.

243
00:11:46,242 --> 00:11:48,444
You shouldn't be out there.

244
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:49,713
Eddie, it's not safe
to drive

245
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,180
when the roads
are slick like this.

246
00:11:51,247 --> 00:11:52,314
Sweetheart,
it stopped raining, like,

247
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:53,817
three hours ago.
All right?

248
00:11:53,884 --> 00:11:55,719
- Everything is gonna be fine.
- [horn honking]

249
00:11:55,786 --> 00:11:56,987
Hey, dickhead!
Flow of traffic mean anything to you?

250
00:11:57,054 --> 00:11:58,287
What if you hydroplane?

251
00:11:58,354 --> 00:12:00,057
I'm not gonna hydroplane.

252
00:12:00,123 --> 00:12:01,825
It is my job
to assess risk.

253
00:12:01,892 --> 00:12:03,559
So, please trust me
when I tell you

254
00:12:03,626 --> 00:12:04,928
that, statistically speaking,

255
00:12:04,995 --> 00:12:06,629
I am much more likely to
get into an accident

256
00:12:06,697 --> 00:12:08,865
because I am talking
to you on the phone!

257
00:12:08,932 --> 00:12:10,299
All right?
I have to go.

258
00:12:10,366 --> 00:12:12,069
I will talk to you soon.
Goodbye.

<i>You didn't say,
"Okay, bye, I love you,"</i>

262
00:12:17,174 --> 00:12:18,240
<i>like you usually do.</i>

263
00:12:18,307 --> 00:12:19,508
Listen to me. I can't!

264
00:12:19,575 --> 00:12:20,576
I'm going to be
late to this...

265
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:23,046
meeting.

266
00:12:23,113 --> 00:12:24,346
<i>Say "I love you," Eddie.</i>

Okay, I love you, Mommy.

- Myra. Bye.

<i>It's me. Mike.</i>

[Eddie] Yeah,
I'm pretty good.

Dude! Dude,
what the fuck?

277
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:50,673
You were fine, like,
five seconds ago.

278
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,975
- Who was it? Who called? Huh?
- [breathing heavily]

279
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:55,377
Rich? Rich?
Talk to me.

280
00:12:55,444 --> 00:12:57,147
You're on in two minutes.
You good?

281
00:12:57,214 --> 00:12:58,914
'Cause you look not good.

282
00:13:01,117 --> 00:13:02,284
- I'm fine.
- You're fine? Okay.

283
00:13:02,351 --> 00:13:03,853
And we're walking.
We're walking.

284
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,054
Sixty seconds.

285
00:13:05,121 --> 00:13:06,355
Even faster. All right.

286
00:13:06,422 --> 00:13:07,623
Can we get him
a bottle of water, maybe?

287
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,658
- Bourbon.
- Bourbon. Sure, sure.

288
00:13:09,725 --> 00:13:11,193
And a mint.

289
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,795
It is showtime.

290
00:13:12,862 --> 00:13:14,463
- I don't think I can do this.
- It's what you do.

291
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,198
- You kill. You're a killer.
- That was fast.

292
00:13:16,265 --> 00:13:17,967
Okay. We are
good to go, and...

293
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:19,635
Hey! Where we going?
Where we going?

294
00:13:19,702 --> 00:13:20,970
- No. This way. Attaboy.
- [bell ringing]

295
00:13:21,036 --> 00:13:22,538
Okay.

All right.
How do I look?

297
00:13:25,174 --> 00:13:26,942
Your hands are shaking, Rich.

298
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:28,309
Shit.

All right.
How are we doing tonight?

303
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:46,095
So, my girlfriend
caught me masturbating

304
00:13:46,162 --> 00:13:48,030
to her friend's Facebook page.

305
00:13:48,097 --> 00:13:50,532
[audience laughing]

306
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:52,467
And so now
I'm in Masturbators Anonymous.

307
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:55,370
And I stand up
at the first meeting

308
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:58,207
and I say, "My name
is Richie Trashmouth."

309
00:13:58,274 --> 00:14:00,176
- [boy 1] <i>Trashmouth.</i>
- [boy 2] <i>Shut up, Richie.</i>

310
00:14:00,242 --> 00:14:02,244
- [boy 3] <i>Fucking perv.</i>
- [boy 4] <i>Shut up, Richie.</i>

311
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,411
[boy 5 echoing] <i>Pussy!</i>

312
00:14:03,478 --> 00:14:05,380
Trashmouth. Uh...

313
00:14:07,983 --> 00:14:09,417
Forgot the joke.

314
00:14:09,484 --> 00:14:10,485
[scattered applause]

315
00:14:10,552 --> 00:14:11,553
[woman] You suck!

316
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:12,822
[chuckles awkwardly]

317
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,992
[man] Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen,

318
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:18,693
for letting us
present to you today.

319
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,298
Now, this will include
over a million square feet

320
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:25,433
of commercial
and residential space.

321
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,069
State-of-the-art
office towers.

322
00:14:27,136 --> 00:14:29,504
What I'm really looking for
is to understand

323
00:14:29,571 --> 00:14:32,473
how we create even more
retail opportunities.

324
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,810
If we put in walls here
and all along here...

And with all due respect to you,

I'm getting claustrophobic

just looking at this model.
Aren't you?

330
00:14:49,225 --> 00:14:52,727
Look. Throw up more walls,
it's gonna feel like a prison.

331
00:14:52,794 --> 00:14:54,296
You know what people
want to do in prison?

332
00:14:54,362 --> 00:14:56,165
Get out. Right?

333
00:14:56,232 --> 00:14:59,134
This should be a place
that brings people together.

334
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:01,069
A meeting ground.

335
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,378
A clubhouse.

336
00:15:11,313 --> 00:15:12,747
<i>And if,</i>

337
00:15:12,814 --> 00:15:14,682

00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,517
[Patty] Should I just book it?

343
00:15:50,585 --> 00:15:52,253
You're sure you can
get away from work?

344
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,821
It's summer, why not?

345
00:15:55,023 --> 00:15:57,358
Okay, we are
Buenos Aires-bound.

It's Mike.

[stammering] I don't
know why I didn't...

356
00:16:32,293 --> 00:16:34,195
How long's it been?
[chuckles]

357
00:16:34,262 --> 00:16:35,796
A long time.

358
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:38,865
<i>27 years.</i>

359
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:47,408
It's come back,
hasn't it?

360
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:48,675
<i>That's why
you're calling me?</i>

361
00:16:48,742 --> 00:16:50,877
It's starting again, Stan.

362
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:52,813
<i>Bad things are happening.</i>

363
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,014
[stammering]
Did you call the others?

364
00:16:54,082 --> 00:16:56,351
I mean,
what if they don't come?

365
00:16:56,417 --> 00:16:59,320
We made a promise,
remember?

366
00:16:59,387 --> 00:17:00,921
<i>How soon
can you get here?</i>

367
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:02,789
Um...

368
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,124
Well, I... [stammers]

369
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:06,394
Yeah, I would need to
do a few things...

370
00:17:06,461 --> 00:17:08,095
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

371
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:10,664
<i>We don't have much time.</i>

372
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:13,867
<i>I'll text you
everything you need.</i>

373
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:16,536
I'll see you soon,
Stan the Man.

374

[mouthing]
Do you swear?

377
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,618
I swear, Bill.

378

[Mike] <i>You made
a promise, Beverly.</i>

382
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:56,303
[Beverly] I'm so sorry, Mike.

383
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:58,938
I don't even really remember.

384
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,806
Haven't you ever wondered
why you can't seem

385
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,942
to remember the things
most people should

386
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:06,712
<i>about where they're from,
about who they are,</i>

387
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,714
<i>why you have that scar
on your hand?</i>

388
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,752
<i>No one else remembered,
either.</i>

389
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,223
<i>Eddie, Ben, Stan, Richie...</i>

390
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,358
<i>Bill.</i>

391
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:19,825
Bill.

392
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:22,628
You have to come back.

393
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,264
You all do.

394
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,868
When?

395
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:45,918
- [gasps]
- Whoa.

396
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:47,520
Are you okay?
What's going on?

397
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:51,724
It's the middle of the night.
You're packing?

398
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,225
I didn't want to wake
you, honey.

399
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,661
I know this week's
been really exhausting.

400
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:59,832
I just got a phone call from
an old friend from Derry.

401
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,236
I have to go back there.

402
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,205
It's really hard
to explain why.

403
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:07,273
It's okay.

404
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,944
You don't have to explain
yourself to me. Relax.

405
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,079
I trust you.

406
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,347
Thank you.

407
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:22,687
I just don't understand
why you'd lie to me.

408
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,360
I heard you.

409
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,164
You said the name Mike.

410
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,232
Yes, my friend.

411
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,100
See, there was
a group of us back then,

412
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,303
and we all made a promise to
each other when we were kids.

413
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:40,272
You know trust is everything
in a relationship.

414
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:43,676
You know
it's everything to me, right?

415
00:20:43,741 --> 00:20:45,710
- I know. This isn't...
- Right?

416
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,712
What?
Like the last time?

417
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,548
I never cheated on you.
[whimpers]

418
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,015
You're a bad fucking liar,

419

- Bev.
- [groaning]

420
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:54,819
You're not going anywhere,
okay?

421
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:57,523
I want you to stay right here,

422
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,957
and you're gonna show me

423
00:20:59,023 --> 00:21:01,360
what it is you're gonna
do with Mike. Okay?

424
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:02,961
You're hurting me, honey.

425
00:21:03,027 --> 00:21:05,096
No one else is
gonna love you like me.

426
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:06,398
- You know that, right?
- [grunts]

428
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,468

- [grunting]

430
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,141
Don't make this
fucking harder!

431
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,344
Don't.

432
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,078

You're nothing without me!
You know that, right?

439
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,007
Tell me I'm wrong!

440

Boys.

Little prick's got balls,
I'll give him that.

448

Far enough, Bowers!

449
00:23:10,688 --> 00:23:11,922
I'm not done yet.

450

I'm not done.
I'm not fucking done.

I gotta kill them all!
Fuck, fuck!

453
00:23:16,993 --> 00:23:18,563
Fucking kill them all!
Stop it!

Fuck you!

Henry Bowers,
I am placing you under arrest

457
00:23:25,235 --> 00:23:26,970
for the murder
of Oscar Bowers.

458
00:23:27,037 --> 00:23:29,206
Do you understand, dipshit?

459
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,075
You have the right
to an attorney.

460
00:23:32,142 --> 00:23:34,244
You have the right
to remain silent.

461

462
00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:21,024

Someone needs a little extra
clozapine today, don't they?

467
00:24:36,873 --> 00:24:38,708
Stay in your fucking room.

Thanks a lot.

Yup. Whoa.
Hey. How you doing?

Bill.

483
00:26:18,307 --> 00:26:19,441
I didn't know
if any of you would...

484
00:26:19,508 --> 00:26:20,576
I mean,
after all this time...

485
00:26:20,643 --> 00:26:21,912
- Yeah.
- But of course you came.

486
00:26:21,978 --> 00:26:24,046
You know,
an oath is an oath.

Losers

488
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:28,784
gotta stick together, right?

489
00:26:28,851 --> 00:26:29,986
The Losers.

490
00:26:30,052 --> 00:26:32,388
You remember that.
That's good.

491
00:26:33,489 --> 00:26:35,090
What else do you remember?

492
00:26:35,157 --> 00:26:36,458
I am allergic to soy,

493
00:26:36,525 --> 00:26:38,527
anything that has egg in
it, uh, gluten,

494
00:26:38,594 --> 00:26:42,531
and if I eat a cashew,
I could realistically die.

495
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:45,501
Holy shit.

496
00:27:00,649 --> 00:27:02,618
Is there a password
or something?

497
00:27:05,187 --> 00:27:06,388
I'm sorry.

So, wait, Eddie,
you got married?

521

Yeah, why's that so fucking
funny, dickwad?

522
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:06,547
What?
To, like, a woman?

523
00:28:06,614 --> 00:28:08,516
- Fuck you, bro.
- [Richie laughing]

524

Fuck you!

All right. What about you, Trashmouth?
You married?

526
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:13,187
There's no way
Richie's married.

527
00:28:13,254 --> 00:28:14,455
No, I got married.

528
00:28:14,522 --> 00:28:15,791
- Richie, I don't believe it.
- When?

529
00:28:15,858 --> 00:28:17,225
- Did you not hear this?
- [Eddie] No.

530
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:18,493
You didn't know
I got married?

531
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,694
- No.
- Yeah, no. Me and your mom

532
00:28:19,761 --> 00:28:21,729
are very, very happy
right now.

533
00:28:21,796 --> 00:28:23,331
- [all laughing]
- [Beverly] Yeah, very happy.

534
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:24,465
- [Bill] He totally fell for it!
- Thanks.

535
00:28:24,532 --> 00:28:25,934
[laughing continues]

536
00:28:26,001 --> 00:28:27,602
Fuck you.

537
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:29,771
She's very sweet.
Sometimes, she'll put her arm around me,

538
00:28:29,837 --> 00:28:31,873
and she'll whisper to me,
she'll go...

539
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:35,410
[imitates Jabba the Hutt
speaking alien language]

540
00:28:35,476 --> 00:28:37,745
We all get it.
My mom was a great, big, fat person.

541
00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:39,180
Shh.

542
00:28:39,247 --> 00:28:41,349
Hilarious. Hysterical.

543
00:28:41,416 --> 00:28:43,351
[laughing continues]

544
00:28:43,418 --> 00:28:45,054
[Richie] Yeah,
it's a nice watch.

545
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,555
Wait, let's talk about the
elephant not in the room...

546
00:28:47,622 --> 00:28:48,756
Ben.

547
00:28:48,823 --> 00:28:50,092
What the fuck, man?

548
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,026
Okay, okay.
Obviously, I lost a few pounds.

549
00:28:52,094 --> 00:28:53,828
- [Richie] Lost a few pounds?
- [Eddie] Yeah, no shit you lost

550
00:28:53,895 --> 00:28:55,329
- a few pounds.
- You're, like... You're hot!

551
00:28:55,396 --> 00:28:56,931
[Eddie] That's true.

552
00:28:56,998 --> 00:28:58,433
[Richie] No, you're like
every Brazilian soccer player

553
00:28:58,499 --> 00:28:59,667
wrapped up into one person.
Gorgeous.

554
00:28:59,734 --> 00:29:01,669
Leave him alone.
You're embarrassing him.

555
00:29:01,736 --> 00:29:03,504
Okay, okay, all right.
Please, come on.

556
00:29:03,571 --> 00:29:05,306
Is Stanley coming
or what?

557
00:29:05,373 --> 00:29:06,808
Someone save me.

558
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,311
Stan.

559
00:29:11,713 --> 00:29:13,181
Stan...

560
00:29:13,247 --> 00:29:15,450
Stan Uris.
Stan Urine.

561
00:29:15,516 --> 00:29:17,819
Stanley Urine.
No, no, he's a fucking pussy.

562
00:29:17,885 --> 00:29:18,786
He's not gonna show.

563
00:29:18,853 --> 00:29:20,788
Why would
Stanley save you, anyway?

564
00:29:20,855 --> 00:29:22,457
Was I not the one
who basically

565
00:29:22,523 --> 00:29:23,825
performed surgery on you

566
00:29:23,891 --> 00:29:25,225
- after Bowers cut you up?
- Yes!

567
00:29:25,292 --> 00:29:26,894
Holy shit!
That's right.

568
00:29:26,961 --> 00:29:28,463
Please tell me you ended
up becoming a doctor, Eds.

569
00:29:28,529 --> 00:29:31,866
No, I ended up becoming
a risk analyst.

570
00:29:31,933 --> 00:29:33,201
[Richie] Oh, that sounds
really interesting.

571
00:29:33,266 --> 00:29:34,702
What does that entail?

572
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:37,572
Yeah, so I work for
a big insurance firm and...

573
00:29:37,638 --> 00:29:39,306
[Richie imitates snoring]

574
00:29:41,308 --> 00:29:42,944
[all laughing]

575
00:29:46,379 --> 00:29:48,149
Fuck you, dude.
Fuck you.

576
00:29:48,216 --> 00:29:50,685
Was this job
invented before fun?

577
00:29:50,752 --> 00:29:53,453
- That's so not funny.
- [Richie] It is funny.

578
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,023
What the fuck
are you laughing at?

579
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:57,892
I propose a toast

580
00:29:59,493 --> 00:30:00,895
to the Losers.

581
00:30:03,931 --> 00:30:05,099
[all protest]

582
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:06,868
[lively chattering]

583
00:30:06,934 --> 00:30:08,703
Let's take our
shirts off and kiss!

584
00:30:09,302 --> 00:30:10,504
[all] Oh!

585
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,344
- Oh, here we go.
- [Eddie] Thank you.

586
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,980
Thank you.

587
00:30:19,046 --> 00:30:22,183
Like, Rogan-Marsh,
half my wife's closet Rogan-Marsh?

588
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:24,384
That's... [laughs]
That's huge.

589
00:30:24,451 --> 00:30:27,587
That's our line.
Me and my husband, Tom.

590
00:30:27,654 --> 00:30:28,990
How long have
you been married?

591
00:30:29,056 --> 00:30:30,557
Hey, we saw your movie,

592
00:30:30,624 --> 00:30:31,893
- by the way.
- [Bill] You did?

593
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:33,460
[Beverly] Oh, my God!
It was so good.

594
00:30:33,527 --> 00:30:35,462
- [Bill] Oh, my God.
- It was so scary.

595
00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:36,830
And the ending sucked?

596
00:30:36,897 --> 00:30:37,898
[chuckles]

597
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,867
Yeah, it did.
I'm sorry.

598
00:30:40,934 --> 00:30:42,036
That's all right.

599
00:30:48,109 --> 00:30:49,210
What?

600
00:30:49,277 --> 00:30:50,844
Nothing.
This is just weird.

601
00:30:50,911 --> 00:30:51,912
[Beverly] Yeah.

602
00:30:51,978 --> 00:30:53,647
Just all this,
all these memories,

603
00:30:53,713 --> 00:30:56,883
people that I don't even
remember forgetting.

604
00:30:59,187 --> 00:31:01,289
I mean, it's weird, right?

605
00:31:01,354 --> 00:31:03,123
Now that we're all here,

606
00:31:03,191 --> 00:31:06,126
everything just comes back
faster and faster.

607
00:31:06,194 --> 00:31:07,394
I mean, all of it.

608
00:31:08,461 --> 00:31:10,030
Yeah.

609
00:31:10,096 --> 00:31:11,531
Yeah, you know,
when Mike called me, I threw up.

610
00:31:12,566 --> 00:31:14,334
Isn't that weird?
Like, I got nervous.

611
00:31:14,401 --> 00:31:16,069
I got, like,
sick and I threw up.

612
00:31:16,136 --> 00:31:17,337
[Richie chuckles]

613
00:31:17,904 --> 00:31:19,105
I feel fine now.

614
00:31:19,172 --> 00:31:20,941
I feel very relieved to be
here with you guys.

615
00:31:21,007 --> 00:31:22,709
Why is everybody
looking at me like this?

616
00:31:22,776 --> 00:31:24,544
When Mike called me,
I crashed my car.

617
00:31:24,611 --> 00:31:25,679
- Seriously?
- [Eddie] Yeah.

618
00:31:25,745 --> 00:31:27,214
[Ben] Shit, man,
I hear you.

619
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,115
I mean, my heart
was literally

620
00:31:29,182 --> 00:31:31,785
pounding right
out of my chest.

621
00:31:31,852 --> 00:31:34,020
- I thought it was only me.
- [Bill] It was like pure...

622
00:31:34,087 --> 00:31:35,789
[Bill stuttering]

623
00:31:35,856 --> 00:31:36,857
Fear.

624
00:31:38,692 --> 00:31:41,695
It's fear.
What you felt.

625
00:31:41,761 --> 00:31:45,565
Why did we all
feel like that, Mike?

626
00:31:45,632 --> 00:31:48,702
You remember something
we don't, don't you, Mike?

627
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,340
Something happens to you
when you leave this town.

628
00:31:53,405 --> 00:31:55,609
The farther away,
the hazier it all gets.

629
00:31:55,675 --> 00:31:58,011
But me, I never left.

630
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:00,080
So, yeah.

631
00:32:01,848 --> 00:32:02,949
I remember.

632
00:32:04,284 --> 00:32:06,485
I remember all of it.

633
00:32:09,488 --> 00:32:10,724
Pennywise.

634
00:32:12,725 --> 00:32:14,794
Oh, the fucking clown.
[breathes heavily]

635
00:32:14,861 --> 00:32:17,097
- Oh, shit.
- [Richie] Pennywise.

636
00:32:17,163 --> 00:32:19,132
Mike, you said you wanted
our help with something.

637
00:32:19,199 --> 00:32:20,733
What was that?

638
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,369
There's an echo
here in Derry

639
00:32:22,434 --> 00:32:24,070
that bounces back
every 27 years.

640
00:32:24,137 --> 00:32:25,205
What are you talking about?

641
00:32:25,272 --> 00:32:26,739
Hold on.
Listen, listen.

642
00:32:26,805 --> 00:32:28,607
We thought
we stopped It back then.

643
00:32:28,674 --> 00:32:30,476
We thought It
was done, but...

644
00:32:31,577 --> 00:32:32,745
[Richie] Mike.

645
00:32:32,811 --> 00:32:34,847
- [whimpers]
- A week ago, a man,

646
00:32:34,914 --> 00:32:36,682
Adrian Mellon, slaughtered.

647
00:32:36,749 --> 00:32:39,185
A girl, Lisa Albrecht,
the other night, went missing.

648
00:32:39,252 --> 00:32:40,886
[Bill] All right.

649
00:32:40,953 --> 00:32:42,488
There've already been others,
and there will be more.

650
00:32:42,554 --> 00:32:43,789
[Richie] I don't want to
hear about this shit.

651
00:32:43,856 --> 00:32:46,059
- More death. More pain.
- Calm down.

652
00:32:46,126 --> 00:32:47,227
Let's get another drink.

653
00:32:47,294 --> 00:32:48,661
Let him explain.
Let him explain.

654
00:32:48,727 --> 00:32:50,429
Explain it to us, Mike.

655
00:32:50,496 --> 00:32:51,997
That echo,

656
00:32:53,233 --> 00:32:55,034
we might have changed It,

657
00:32:55,101 --> 00:32:56,336
just like It changed us.

658
00:32:56,403 --> 00:32:58,271
But we didn't stop It.

659
00:32:58,338 --> 00:33:00,439
Because It just bounced back.

660
00:33:02,441 --> 00:33:05,010
We made an oath.

661
00:33:05,077 --> 00:33:08,180
That's why I brought you back.
That's why you're here.

662
00:33:08,248 --> 00:33:10,049
To finish It.

663
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:11,617
For good.

664
00:33:13,652 --> 00:33:15,554
Well, that shit got dark fast.

665
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:16,822
Thanks, Mike.

666
00:33:20,393 --> 00:33:22,695
My fortune cookie
just says "Could."

667
00:33:24,229 --> 00:33:25,764
They don't know how to do
fortune cookies here.

668
00:33:25,831 --> 00:33:26,999
Mine just says "Guess."

669
00:33:27,066 --> 00:33:30,369
You wanna throw
that over here?

670
00:33:30,437 --> 00:33:31,637
[Bill exhales deeply]

671
00:33:32,805 --> 00:33:34,473
What you got, Mikey?

672
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,908
[inhales shakily]

673
00:33:39,778 --> 00:33:41,046
[Eddie] Wait, what?

674
00:33:41,113 --> 00:33:42,715
[Mike] This is
what I'm talking about.

675
00:33:42,781 --> 00:33:45,150
[Richie] "Guess. Cut.
Not. Could. It."

676
00:33:45,217 --> 00:33:46,685
It's a message.

677
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,620
[Richie] No,
"Guess it could not cut."

678
00:33:48,687 --> 00:33:50,956
[Eddie] Why would it guess
it could not cut?

679
00:33:51,023 --> 00:33:52,091
[Ben] Cut what?

680
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:53,558
[Richie] "Guess
it could not cut."

681
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:55,294
"It" goes in front.
There.

682
00:33:55,361 --> 00:33:56,729
"It could not guess."

683
00:33:56,795 --> 00:33:59,164
- It couldn't guess.
- [Richie] "Could it..."

684
00:33:59,231 --> 00:34:00,498
No. "Could it not cut."

685
00:34:00,565 --> 00:34:02,067
When it says "It,"
is it talking about It?

686
00:34:02,134 --> 00:34:03,969
- Yeah. All right.
- [Eddie] Is that what it means?

687
00:34:04,036 --> 00:34:05,371
- Is "It" It?
- Where does this go?

688
00:34:05,437 --> 00:34:06,472
That's what
I'm talking about.

689
00:34:06,537 --> 00:34:07,906
It... It could...

690
00:34:07,973 --> 00:34:09,274
[Richie] I don't know
what it fucking means!

691
00:34:09,341 --> 00:34:10,809
You fuck with
the fortune cookies, Mike?

692
00:34:10,876 --> 00:34:12,144
- No.
- Whoa. Let him speak, man.

693
00:34:12,211 --> 00:34:14,446
This is not me.
This is what It does.

694
00:34:14,512 --> 00:34:16,181
[Eddie]
I need my fucking inhaler!

695
00:34:16,248 --> 00:34:18,050
[Richie] What is wrong with you, man?
Why'd you call us?

696
00:34:18,117 --> 00:34:19,517
- This is not fucking funny!
- [Eddie] This is so not funny!

697
00:34:19,584 --> 00:34:20,919
- [Bill] Beverly?
- This is so not funny.

698
00:34:29,161 --> 00:34:30,262
[breathing shakily]

699
00:34:32,297 --> 00:34:33,966
[men gasp]

700
00:34:50,615 --> 00:34:51,916
[Eddie]
Why does it say Stanley?

701
00:34:53,051 --> 00:34:55,354
Someone else
fucking answer me!

702
00:34:55,421 --> 00:34:56,422
[fortune cookies rattling]

703
00:34:56,488 --> 00:34:57,789
Holy shit.

704
00:34:59,158 --> 00:35:00,325
Holy shit.

705
00:35:08,467 --> 00:35:10,735
What the fuck
is that, man?

706
00:35:10,802 --> 00:35:12,337
Oh, my God.

707
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:16,074
Whoa, whoa!

708
00:35:17,608 --> 00:35:18,810
[crying]

709
00:35:19,844 --> 00:35:21,879
- Whoa!
- [whimpering]

710
00:35:26,184 --> 00:35:27,185
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

711
00:35:28,319 --> 00:35:29,320
Shit.

712
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,723
Hey! Hey!

713
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:35,293
That fortune cookie's
looking at me! Shit!

714
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:36,360
[yelping]

715
00:35:38,663 --> 00:35:40,731
I don't want to be here.
I can't fucking do this.

716
00:35:40,798 --> 00:35:42,834
I wanna go home!
I don't wanna be here!

717
00:35:43,535 --> 00:35:44,735
I don't wanna be here!

718
00:35:44,802 --> 00:35:45,736
I wanna go home!
I don't wanna be here!

719
00:35:45,803 --> 00:35:47,071
Holy shit!

720
00:35:48,739 --> 00:35:49,907
Hey! God damn it.

721
00:35:49,974 --> 00:35:51,275
[panicked chattering]

722
00:35:52,477 --> 00:35:54,512
[both screaming]

723
00:35:54,579 --> 00:35:56,047
Hey, Eddie!

724
00:36:05,323 --> 00:36:06,656
[bleating]

725
00:36:07,525 --> 00:36:08,893

[yelps]

727
00:36:13,231 --> 00:36:14,698
Whoa! Fuck!

728
00:36:14,765 --> 00:36:16,134
It's not real!

729
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,068
[screeches]

730
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:19,137
This isn't real!
It's not real!

731
00:36:20,071 --> 00:36:22,206
It's not real!
It's not real!

732
00:36:22,273 --> 00:36:24,774
It's not real!
It's not real!

733
00:36:24,842 --> 00:36:28,179
It's not real!
It's not real!

734
00:36:28,246 --> 00:36:30,114
[waitress]
Is everything all right?

735
00:36:31,983 --> 00:36:34,651
Yeah, yeah.
Could we get the check?

736
00:36:39,856 --> 00:36:41,325
That's what
Pennywise does, right?

737
00:36:41,392 --> 00:36:43,027
He fucks with us.
So, Stanley's probably fine.

738
00:36:43,094 --> 00:36:44,595
Hey, Mike.
Do you have Stan's number?

739
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,197
Yeah.

740
00:36:46,264 --> 00:36:47,431
[boy] Hey, Richie.

741
00:36:49,766 --> 00:36:51,269
[Richie] How'd you...

742
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:52,669
How'd you know my name?

743
00:36:52,736 --> 00:36:54,804
The fun's just beginning.

744
00:36:55,573 --> 00:36:56,873
Right?

745
00:37:01,612 --> 00:37:03,514
What he said, is it...

746
00:37:03,581 --> 00:37:05,148
Listen.
You think this is funny?

747
00:37:05,216 --> 00:37:06,284
All right?

748
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,852
Think this is
some sort of game, huh?

749
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:10,120
Well, fuck you,
all right?

750
00:37:10,187 --> 00:37:11,489
[Bill] Rich,
be careful, dude.

751
00:37:11,556 --> 00:37:13,291
Fuck you!
I'm not afraid of you!

752
00:37:14,659 --> 00:37:16,092
"The fun's just beginning."

753
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:18,496
The line from your act, dude.
I'm a fan.

754
00:37:18,563 --> 00:37:21,164
- Are those your parents?
- Yeah.

755
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,934
You want a picture?

756
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,102
- You okay, Dean? Come on.
- I think I'm good.

757
00:37:26,169 --> 00:37:29,039
[Richie] Okay, cool.
He's a good kid.

758
00:37:29,105 --> 00:37:30,807
Jesus, Richie.
You don't remember a line

759
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:32,175
from your own show?

760
00:37:32,242 --> 00:37:34,344
I don't write
my own material.

761
00:37:34,411 --> 00:37:37,147
I fucking knew it!
I fucking knew it!

762
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:41,552
Hello, Mrs. Uris.
My name's Beverly Marsh.

763
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:42,852
I apologize for calling,

764
00:37:42,919 --> 00:37:44,721
but I'm an old friend
of your husband's.

765
00:37:44,788 --> 00:37:46,389
You lied to us.
That's not okay.

766
00:37:46,456 --> 00:37:48,258
Yeah, first words out of your
mouth should have been like,

767
00:37:48,325 --> 00:37:50,193
"Hey, man. You want to come
to Derry and get murdered?"

768
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,562
'Cause then
I would have said no.

769
00:37:51,629 --> 00:37:52,663
Guys.

770
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:54,431
[Richie]
Fucking entrapment, man.

771
00:37:54,497 --> 00:37:55,600
[Patty on phone] <i>Oh...</i>

772
00:37:55,666 --> 00:37:57,167
[Patty sighs tearfully]

773
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:59,069
<i>He passed.</i>

774
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:01,938
[Beverly] When did it happen?

775
00:38:02,606 --> 00:38:04,774
<i>Yesterday.</i>

776
00:38:04,841 --> 00:38:07,477
<i>It was horrible,
the way he died.</i>

777
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:10,080
<i>His wrists.</i>

778
00:38:10,146 --> 00:38:12,415
- In the bathtub.
- <i>In the bathtub.</i>

779
00:38:14,884 --> 00:38:18,255
<i>I'm sorry.
I have to go.</i>

780
00:38:18,321 --> 00:38:20,857
[Beverly] We're all very
sorry, Patty.

781
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:22,192
<i>Thank you.</i>

782
00:38:25,462 --> 00:38:26,529
Stanley.

783
00:38:28,198 --> 00:38:30,400
Pennywise knew.
He knew before we did.

784
00:38:30,467 --> 00:38:32,202
We have to stop him.
I have a plan.

785
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:33,937
[Richie] I got a plan.
Getting the fuck out of Dodge

786
00:38:34,004 --> 00:38:36,273
before this ends worse
than one of Bill's books.

787
00:38:36,339 --> 00:38:37,773
Who's with me?

788
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,042
We made a promise
to each other.

789
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:40,710
Let's un-make the promise.

790
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:42,078
Richie, other people
are gonna die.

791
00:38:42,145 --> 00:38:44,281
Other people
die every day, man!

792
00:38:44,347 --> 00:38:46,316
We don't owe
this town shit!

793
00:38:46,383 --> 00:38:49,018
Plus, I just remembered I grew up
here, like, two hours ago.

794
00:38:49,085 --> 00:38:51,854
So, I'm fucking leaving.
Fuck this.

795
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,257
[Eddie] I'm sorry, man,
I'm with Richie.

796
00:38:54,324 --> 00:38:55,824
- Eds, please.
- Listen.

797
00:38:55,891 --> 00:38:58,662
What? We stay,
we die, that's it?

798
00:38:58,728 --> 00:39:01,130
I'm gonna go back to the inn,
I'm gonna pack up my shit,

799
00:39:01,197 --> 00:39:02,699
and I'm gonna
drive to my home.

800
00:39:02,766 --> 00:39:04,133
- I'm sorry, man. Good luck.
- [car engine starting]

801
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,968
No, Eddie. Please.
Please, Eddie!

802
00:39:06,035 --> 00:39:07,570
Eddie, wait!

803
00:39:10,373 --> 00:39:11,474
You okay?

804
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:15,010
I'm gonna head back
to the Town House, too.

805
00:39:15,077 --> 00:39:16,845
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.

806
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:20,750
You should have told us,
Mikey.

807
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,985
Bill. Please, man.

808
00:39:23,052 --> 00:39:24,219
I'm begging you.
Please.

809
00:39:24,286 --> 00:39:25,755
Just listen to me, man.
Please.

810
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:27,424
What are you gonna say?

811
00:39:29,258 --> 00:39:30,527
What could you possibly say

812
00:39:30,593 --> 00:39:31,695
that would make
any kind of a difference?

813
00:39:31,761 --> 00:39:33,929
They're all gone.

814
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:36,265
Come on.
Let me show you something.

815
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:39,868
One thing. And if you want to
leave, you can leave.

816
00:39:39,935 --> 00:39:41,403
Just let me show you
this first. Please.

817

[spectators cheering]

818
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:50,780
[boy] Lapskew!
What kind of name is that, huh?

819
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,181
My mom swings
better than you!

820
00:39:52,247 --> 00:39:53,583
How many times
do I have to...

821
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:56,385
She doesn't even play
baseball! You suck!

822
00:39:59,823 --> 00:40:02,224
Mommy, how much longer?

823
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:05,127
Victoria,
we came to watch the game.

824
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,296
We're gonna
watch the game.

825
00:40:07,996 --> 00:40:09,465

[gasps]

827
00:41:05,821 --> 00:41:08,457
Hello, Vicky.

828
00:41:08,524 --> 00:41:10,793
Isn't that what
your friends call you?

829
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:12,059
Vicky?

830
00:41:13,161 --> 00:41:14,962
How did I know that?

831
00:41:15,029 --> 00:41:18,600
I guess I must be
your friend, too. [laughs]

832
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:21,603
If you're my friend,
why are you hiding in the dark?

833
00:41:24,172 --> 00:41:26,475
You're not my friend.
You're scary.

834
00:41:28,943 --> 00:41:31,045
[Pennywise crying]

835
00:41:35,818 --> 00:41:37,351
Why are you crying?

836
00:41:39,688 --> 00:41:43,157
People always make fun
'cause of the way I look.

837
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,162
I thought if you
couldn't see my face,

838
00:41:48,229 --> 00:41:51,633
then maybe you'd
want to be my friend.

839
00:41:52,835 --> 00:41:54,603
Never mind. [sobs]

840
00:41:54,670 --> 00:42:00,241
Oh, silly old Pennywise,
you'll never have no friends.

841
00:42:00,308 --> 00:42:02,143
People make fun
of me, too.

842
00:42:03,745 --> 00:42:05,012
They do?

843
00:42:06,682 --> 00:42:08,115
'Cause of this.

844
00:42:09,852 --> 00:42:11,419
Well, isn't that silly?

845
00:42:12,587 --> 00:42:14,689
That little thing?

846
00:42:14,756 --> 00:42:17,425
Why, I can blow
that thing right away.

847
00:42:18,794 --> 00:42:19,862
You could?

848
00:42:19,928 --> 00:42:21,262
Oh, yes!

849
00:42:21,329 --> 00:42:24,265
One poof and it'd be gone!
[giggles]

850
00:42:27,134 --> 00:42:30,705
You would have to get close
enough to see my face.

851
00:42:31,606 --> 00:42:32,740
I don't know, Vicky.

852
00:42:32,807 --> 00:42:35,543
No, it's okay.
I won't make fun. I promise.

853
00:42:37,478 --> 00:42:38,579
Promise promise?

854
00:42:40,281 --> 00:42:42,016
Well, okie-dokie!

855
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:43,684
Just come on in
a little closer,

856
00:42:43,751 --> 00:42:47,588
and we'll blow it away on
the count of three! [giggles]

two...

860
00:43:07,275 --> 00:43:08,609

Fuck yeah!

Hey, Hockstetter.

- Let's go! [whooping]
- [tires screeching]

Let's get our shit and
get the fuck out of here.

874
00:44:26,553 --> 00:44:27,955
Did you leave
your stuff here?

875

still in the car.

- Tell me.
- Tell you what?

Whatever it is you're
afraid to tell me right now.

00:44:55,615 --> 00:44:56,816
Back at the Jade when you were
on the phone with Stanley's...

881
00:44:56,883 --> 00:44:57,884
Stop.

882
00:44:59,719 --> 00:45:02,856
She told you that she
found him in the bathtub,

883
00:45:02,922 --> 00:45:04,457
but, Bev, I saw you.

884
00:45:04,524 --> 00:45:08,028
I heard it.
You said it first.

885
00:45:08,094 --> 00:45:09,596
Whatever you guys
are talking about,

886
00:45:09,663 --> 00:45:11,364
let's make it happen faster,
all right? We gotta go.

887
00:45:11,431 --> 00:45:13,566
<i>Eduardo, andale!</i>
Let's go!

888
00:45:13,633 --> 00:45:16,336
There's something
you're not telling us.

889
00:45:16,403 --> 00:45:18,605
You knew how Stanley died.
You knew.

890
00:45:19,939 --> 00:45:20,940
Wait, what?

891
00:45:21,975 --> 00:45:24,377
I can't do this.

892
00:45:24,444 --> 00:45:25,979
She knew how Stanley
was going to die,

893
00:45:26,046 --> 00:45:27,279
is that what
she just said?

894
00:45:27,346 --> 00:45:29,482
You can't just
walk away from this.

895
00:45:29,549 --> 00:45:30,850
- [bell dinging]
- How did you know

896
00:45:30,917 --> 00:45:31,918
where he killed himself?

897
00:45:31,985 --> 00:45:33,185
Bev.

898
00:45:34,154 --> 00:45:35,422
Talk to me.

899
00:45:35,488 --> 00:45:37,356
Just talk to me.
Like we used to.

900
00:45:37,423 --> 00:45:39,324
Come on,
how did you know?

901
00:45:39,993 --> 00:45:41,427
Because I saw it.

902
00:45:43,096 --> 00:45:45,397
I've seen all of us die.

903
00:45:45,464 --> 00:45:46,800
[bags thumping]

904
00:45:46,866 --> 00:45:48,168
Okay, I just got to
grab my toiletry bag,

905
00:45:48,233 --> 00:45:49,268
and then we can go.

906
00:45:49,334 --> 00:45:50,570
[bags thud]

907
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:52,672
What'd I miss?

908
00:46:06,886 --> 00:46:08,420
[Bill] The library?

909
00:46:08,487 --> 00:46:09,856
- [Mike] Mmm-hmm.
- [Bill gasps]

910
00:46:12,125 --> 00:46:13,625
Wow.

911
00:46:13,692 --> 00:46:16,295
Didn't this place
used to be bigger?

912
00:46:28,007 --> 00:46:30,709
Yo! [stutters]
Mike, where are you going?

913
00:46:56,001 --> 00:46:58,337
Mike, you live here?

914
00:46:58,403 --> 00:47:00,405
Yeah.
Make yourself at home.

915
00:47:00,472 --> 00:47:01,807
[fridge door opens]

916
00:47:01,874 --> 00:47:03,442
- You want some water?
- [Bill] Yeah, sure.

917
00:47:04,343 --> 00:47:05,544
[water pouring]

918
00:47:17,189 --> 00:47:19,491
You see, memory's the thing.

919
00:47:19,558 --> 00:47:21,093
It's the key.

920
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,661
It's the key
to everything.

921
00:47:22,728 --> 00:47:26,498
If It really does want
us [stutters] back here,

922
00:47:26,565 --> 00:47:27,766
don't you think the
smartest thing we can do

923
00:47:27,833 --> 00:47:29,234
is just get the hell
out of Derry?

924
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,870
No, no, no.
It does want us back.

925
00:47:31,937 --> 00:47:33,038
Of course It does!

926
00:47:33,105 --> 00:47:34,439
But It doesn't know
I know what I know.

927
00:47:34,506 --> 00:47:35,641
What do you know?

928
00:47:35,707 --> 00:47:37,009
How to kill the shit
out of It!

929
00:47:38,376 --> 00:47:39,978
I've read every book.

930
00:47:40,045 --> 00:47:42,581
I've talked to every person
in this godforsaken town,

931
00:47:42,648 --> 00:47:44,249
everybody that would talk to
me, anyway,

932
00:47:44,315 --> 00:47:46,450
and that's not a long list.

933
00:47:46,518 --> 00:47:47,753
But it wasn't enough.

934
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:50,055
I had to know
how this all started.

935
00:47:50,122 --> 00:47:52,825
How It started.

936
00:47:57,361 --> 00:47:59,064
And It started

937
00:48:01,233 --> 00:48:04,203
- here.
- Whoa.

938
00:48:04,269 --> 00:48:07,405
- What am I looking at, Mike?
- It's an artifact.

939
00:48:07,471 --> 00:48:09,808
Early 18th century Shokopiwah.

940
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:12,277
Shoko...
How'd you get it?

941
00:48:12,343 --> 00:48:13,846
I found it, in the...

942
00:48:13,912 --> 00:48:16,315
No, no,
they gave it to me.

943
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,448
I stole it.

944
00:48:17,515 --> 00:48:19,483
You stole it?

945
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:21,786
- From Native Americans?
- Uh...

946
00:48:21,854 --> 00:48:25,157
- It's complicated.
- Yeah, it is.

947
00:48:25,224 --> 00:48:26,557
They helped me
on my journey.

948
00:48:26,624 --> 00:48:28,392
So beautiful.

949
00:48:28,459 --> 00:48:31,629
They showed me things.
A vision.

950
00:48:31,696 --> 00:48:33,265
Ow.

951
00:48:33,332 --> 00:48:34,699
Holy fuck.

952
00:48:34,765 --> 00:48:36,801
I feel kind of funky.

953
00:48:36,868 --> 00:48:37,935
Hot.

954
00:48:38,003 --> 00:48:39,104
Am I sweating?

955
00:48:39,171 --> 00:48:41,306
I need you to see
what they showed me, Bill.

956
00:48:41,372 --> 00:48:42,707
[echoing] Bill.

957
00:48:46,278 --> 00:48:48,479
They live outside of Derry.

958
00:48:48,546 --> 00:48:50,615
<i>Beyond It's reach.</i>

959
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:52,884
<i>They moved there
many years ago.</i>

960
00:48:53,684 --> 00:48:55,553
<i>Their holy man,</i>

961
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,955
<i>their holy of holies,</i>

962
00:48:59,124 --> 00:49:00,325
<i>he took me in.</i>

963
00:49:00,391 --> 00:49:02,560
[speaking native language]

964
00:49:02,627 --> 00:49:04,128
[Mike in English]
<i>Fed me their sacred Maturin.</i>

965
00:49:05,429 --> 00:49:08,065
<i>I started to...
To react.</i>

966
00:49:08,132 --> 00:49:11,168
All living things
must abide by the laws

967
00:49:11,236 --> 00:49:12,803
of the shape they inhabit.

968
00:49:14,339 --> 00:49:15,773
[screaming]

969
00:49:18,377 --> 00:49:20,978
[Mike] <i>While I sat there,
looking out over the valley,</i>

970
00:49:21,045 --> 00:49:23,147
<i>I saw It arrive.</i>

971
00:49:27,318 --> 00:49:30,922
I knew that one day,
I would have to make you all see.

972
00:49:30,988 --> 00:49:31,989
Mike,

973
00:49:34,392 --> 00:49:36,127
did you put something
in my drink?

974
00:49:37,595 --> 00:49:39,130
It's, uh...

975
00:49:39,196 --> 00:49:40,364
It's a root.

976
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:41,766
You... [stutters]

977
00:49:41,832 --> 00:49:42,967
You drugged me?
You drugged me?

978
00:49:43,034 --> 00:49:44,869
No, it's a root
with properties.

979
00:49:44,936 --> 00:49:47,038
It's just a micro-dose of
what the Shokopiwah gave me...

980
00:49:47,104 --> 00:49:48,172
Why would you do that?

981
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:50,074
...to open my eyes.

982
00:49:50,141 --> 00:49:51,742
I don't feel real good.

983
00:49:51,809 --> 00:49:54,979
I need you to look,

984
00:49:55,046 --> 00:49:56,180
and you'll see.

985
00:49:56,247 --> 00:49:58,149
[Bill] I don't feel good.

986
00:49:58,215 --> 00:49:59,616
[Mike] Open your eyes.

987
00:49:59,684 --> 00:50:01,518
Open your eyes.

988
00:50:01,584 --> 00:50:03,788
<i>They showed me the past.</i>

989
00:50:04,554 --> 00:50:05,756
[yelps]

990
00:50:10,127 --> 00:50:13,097
<i>Showed me the way
It appeared to them.</i>

991
00:50:13,164 --> 00:50:14,165
[whimpering]

992
00:50:21,072 --> 00:50:22,073
[screams]

993
00:50:25,542 --> 00:50:27,411
<i>They showed me
their pain.</i>

994
00:50:27,477 --> 00:50:29,579
[both screaming]

995
00:50:31,015 --> 00:50:33,616
<i>They showed me
how to stop It!</i>

996
00:50:33,683 --> 00:50:35,819
[Native Americans chanting
in native language]

997
00:50:40,523 --> 00:50:42,159
[Bill breathing heavily]

998
00:50:43,526 --> 00:50:44,728
It's over.

999
00:50:44,794 --> 00:50:46,297
It's over.
You're okay.

1000
00:50:46,364 --> 00:50:49,400
You're okay.
Did you see it?

1001
00:50:49,467 --> 00:50:50,767
The ritual?

1002
00:50:50,834 --> 00:50:52,535
- The Ritual of Chud?
- Yeah, I knew you...

1003
00:50:52,602 --> 00:50:55,172
I knew you would see it.

1004
00:50:55,239 --> 00:50:58,376
I saw the whole fucking
thing, Mike.

1005
00:50:58,442 --> 00:51:00,744
That's how we kill It.

1006
00:51:06,916 --> 00:51:09,019
How are we going
to do it?

1007
00:51:09,085 --> 00:51:12,490
Everybody already
[stuttering] said no.

1008
00:51:12,555 --> 00:51:14,258
But with you,

1009
00:51:16,427 --> 00:51:18,728
they'll listen.

1010
00:51:18,795 --> 00:51:21,698
This won't work
without all of us.

1011
00:51:25,101 --> 00:51:27,904
Okay. So, what do you mean
that you've seen us all die?

1012
00:51:27,971 --> 00:51:29,373
Yeah,
'cause I gotta be honest.

1013
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,940
That's a fucked-up thing
to just drop on somebody.

1014
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:34,244
Every night since Derry,

1015
00:51:36,613 --> 00:51:38,081
I've been having
these nightmares.

1016
00:51:39,682 --> 00:51:42,786
People in pain.
People dying.

1017
00:51:43,253 --> 00:51:44,354
People...

1018
00:51:44,421 --> 00:51:45,789
[Eddie]
So, you have nightmares.

1019
00:51:45,855 --> 00:51:47,323
I have nightmares.
People, they have nightmares.

1020
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:50,060
But that doesn't mean
that your visions are true.

1021
00:51:52,629 --> 00:51:55,865
I've watched
every single one of us...

1022
00:51:55,932 --> 00:51:58,134
[Bill] You've seen
every single one of us what?

1023
00:52:02,939 --> 00:52:05,208
At the place that
Stanley wound up.

1024
00:52:07,277 --> 00:52:09,479
That's how we end.

1025
00:52:09,546 --> 00:52:12,248
Okay, how come the rest of
us aren't seeing that shit?

1026
00:52:12,315 --> 00:52:13,783
I mean,
what makes her so different?

1027
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:15,051
The Deadlights.

1028
00:52:16,286 --> 00:52:18,788
The Deadlights.

1029
00:52:31,968 --> 00:52:33,236
She was the only
one of us

1030
00:52:33,303 --> 00:52:35,637
that got caught in
the Deadlights that day.

1031
00:52:36,805 --> 00:52:38,308
We were all
touched by It.

1032
00:52:38,374 --> 00:52:39,808
Changed.

1033
00:52:39,875 --> 00:52:43,712
Deep down. Like an infection.
Or a virus.

1034
00:52:43,779 --> 00:52:46,116
A virus.
You understand.

1035
00:52:46,182 --> 00:52:47,450
Slowly growing.

1036
00:52:47,517 --> 00:52:50,786
That virus,
it's been growing for 27 years.

1037
00:52:50,853 --> 00:52:52,921
This whole time,
metastasizing.

1038
00:52:52,988 --> 00:52:54,390
It just got to Stan
first, because...

1039
00:52:54,457 --> 00:52:55,592
He was the weakest.

1040
00:52:55,657 --> 00:52:57,160
Jesus Christ, Rich.

1041
00:52:57,227 --> 00:52:59,061
Just saying what everyone
else is thinking, man.

1042
00:52:59,129 --> 00:53:00,563
I mean,
Rich, come on.

1043
00:53:00,629 --> 00:53:03,466
What Beverly sees,
it will come to pass.

1044
00:53:03,533 --> 00:53:05,401
It's what'll happen to
all of us, eventually,

1045
00:53:05,468 --> 00:53:06,768
unless we stop It.

1046
00:53:06,835 --> 00:53:08,338
How the hell are we
supposed to do that?

1047
00:53:09,372 --> 00:53:10,739
The Ritual of Chud.

1048
00:53:12,342 --> 00:53:13,909
The Shokopiwah.

1049
00:53:13,976 --> 00:53:17,179
The first ones who fought
It, they have a saying.

1050
00:53:17,246 --> 00:53:19,181
"All living things
must abide by

1051
00:53:19,248 --> 00:53:20,583
"the laws of the
shape they inhabit."

1052
00:53:20,649 --> 00:53:21,950
A tribal ritual?

1053
00:53:23,785 --> 00:53:25,154
Are you fucking kidding me, man?

1054
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:26,955
All right,
there's gotta be another way.

1055
00:53:27,022 --> 00:53:29,057
Okay? This thing comes
back, what, every 27 years?

1056
00:53:29,124 --> 00:53:31,093
Let's just kick the can down
the road and do it then.

1057
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,794
Wait, we'll be 70 years
old, asshole.

1058
00:53:32,861 --> 00:53:34,663
[Beverly] It doesn't
work that way.

1059
00:53:35,998 --> 00:53:37,799
None of us make it
another 20 years,

1060
00:53:38,734 --> 00:53:40,235
and the way it happens...

1061
00:53:42,539 --> 00:53:45,474
So, if we don't beat It
this cycle, then...

1062
00:53:45,542 --> 00:53:47,009
We die.

1063
00:53:47,075 --> 00:53:48,143
Horribly.

1064
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:49,945
Yeah, I don't need
the "horribly" part.

1065
00:53:50,012 --> 00:53:51,680
I didn't say it.
She said it. Not me.

1066
00:53:51,747 --> 00:53:53,081
[Bill] All right, guys.
Look.

1067
00:53:53,148 --> 00:53:55,951
I've seen [stuttering]
what he's talking about,

1068
00:53:57,286 --> 00:53:59,121
and it's all true.

1069
00:53:59,955 --> 00:54:01,857
It's the only way.

1070
00:54:03,258 --> 00:54:04,893
If we want
this ritual to work...

1071
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,295
We have to remember.

1072
00:54:07,696 --> 00:54:10,132
Remember what?

1073
00:54:10,199 --> 00:54:11,400
[wind blowing]

1074
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:16,805
[Mike] <i>It's better
if I show you.</i>

1075
00:54:18,073 --> 00:54:19,841
<i>We don't have
much time.</i>

1076
00:54:22,177 --> 00:54:23,778
<i>His cycle
will end soon.</i>

1077
00:54:25,647 --> 00:54:26,949
<i>And once it does...</i>

1078
00:54:27,015 --> 00:54:28,283
[Eddie] <i>We're fucked.</i>

1079
00:54:51,005 --> 00:54:52,807
[Beverly] The Barrens.

1080
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:54,509
This is where we came.

1081
00:54:55,544 --> 00:54:57,246
After the rock fight.

1082
00:54:58,580 --> 00:54:59,780
The clubhouse.

1083
00:55:00,582 --> 00:55:02,217
You built that for us.

1084
00:55:02,284 --> 00:55:03,719
Yeah, the hatch has got to
be around here someplace.

1085
00:55:03,784 --> 00:55:05,687
[Eddie] You did.
I do remember that!

1086
00:55:05,753 --> 00:55:07,322
- Oh!
- Whoa! Whoa!

1087
00:55:08,724 --> 00:55:10,091
You okay?

1088
00:55:11,627 --> 00:55:13,160
[Beverly laughs]

1089
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:14,829
- What?
- Nothing, it's just...

1090
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:17,366
You haven't changed.

1091
00:55:18,433 --> 00:55:19,635
It's a good thing.

1092
00:55:19,701 --> 00:55:20,935
[both chuckle]

1093
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:26,974
You know what?
I actually think the door was more like

1094
00:55:28,175 --> 00:55:29,277
around...

1095
00:55:29,844 --> 00:55:31,045
[crashing]

1096
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:36,784
Found it.

1097
00:55:37,486 --> 00:55:38,553
I'm okay!

1098
00:55:39,287 --> 00:55:40,354
Come down!

1099
00:55:57,538 --> 00:55:58,873
What the dick is this?

1100
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:00,308
How'd you build it?

1101
00:56:01,475 --> 00:56:03,277
When did you build it?

1102
00:56:03,344 --> 00:56:05,446
Here and there,
I guess.

1103
00:56:05,513 --> 00:56:06,947
It was already dug
out from something,

1104
00:56:07,014 --> 00:56:09,283
so I just had to
reinforce the walls

1105
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:10,985
and get some wood
for the roof door,

1106
00:56:11,052 --> 00:56:12,788
and that's pretty much it.

1107
00:56:12,853 --> 00:56:14,855
Pretty good for
my first time, huh?

1108
00:56:14,922 --> 00:56:17,224
[Young Stanley yelps]

1109
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:18,893
[Young Richie] Now,
that's a cool feature.

1110
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:20,094
What happens when
you put your hand

1111
00:56:20,161 --> 00:56:21,896
on the other pillar,
professor?

1112
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:24,098
Okay, you see, this is exactly
why there are safety codes,

1113
00:56:24,165 --> 00:56:25,633
why we have permits.

1114
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,301
This place is a death trap.
You understand that?

1115
00:56:27,368 --> 00:56:29,036
Well, it's a work in progress.
Okay, Eddie?

1116
00:56:29,103 --> 00:56:30,671
Just so you know, I get
hurt, you are liable.

1117
00:56:30,738 --> 00:56:32,673
And, also, what is this?
The switch of an iron maiden?

1118
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:33,840
That's a flashlight.

1119
00:56:33,907 --> 00:56:35,076
What is that,
a horse hitch?

1120
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:36,577
When do you have
horses down...

1121
00:56:36,644 --> 00:56:37,812
Oh, this is cool.

1122
00:56:37,877 --> 00:56:39,113
That was like,
three dollars,

1123
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:40,681
so be careful with that, please.

1124
00:56:40,748 --> 00:56:42,249
I have one of these.
Hey, Stan, you see this?

1125
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:43,950
Yeah, okay,
can you maybe not?

1126
00:56:44,018 --> 00:56:45,653
Maybe not what? Yeah, yeah, hold on.
Maybe not what?

1127
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,088
Be awesome and have fun

1128
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:48,988
and celebrate the magic
of the paddle-ball?

1129
00:56:49,856 --> 00:56:51,325
Wow.

1130
00:56:51,392 --> 00:56:53,127
Oh, good going, fucknut.
You broke his thing.

1131
00:56:53,194 --> 00:56:54,295
- I broke it?
- Yeah,

1132
00:56:54,362 --> 00:56:55,629
you broke it
with your face.

1133
00:56:55,696 --> 00:56:57,431
What?

1134
00:56:57,498 --> 00:56:59,032
[Young Eddie] I'm not putting
my fucking hand down there.

1135
00:57:03,437 --> 00:57:04,438
[blows]

1136
00:57:06,139 --> 00:57:07,575
[Eddie] Oh, man.
That's so cool.

1137
00:57:08,542 --> 00:57:10,578
[Bill] Oh, my God.

1138
00:57:10,644 --> 00:57:14,047
[Eddie] How do we all not
remember that this was here?

1139
00:57:14,114 --> 00:57:16,015
[Richie as Pennywise]
Hey, Losers.

1140
00:57:18,452 --> 00:57:20,321
Time to float.

1141
00:57:23,858 --> 00:57:25,058
[laughing]

1142
00:57:25,125 --> 00:57:27,093
- Ahh!
- Fuck, Richie.

1143
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,729
- Dude!
- Remember when he used to say

1144
00:57:28,796 --> 00:57:31,331
that shit?
And he'd do that little dance.

1145
00:57:31,399 --> 00:57:33,567
[vocalizing]

1146
00:57:33,634 --> 00:57:35,436
Am I the only one
who remembers this shit?

1147
00:57:35,503 --> 00:57:38,572
Are you gonna be like this
the entire time we're home?

1148
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:40,808
All right. Just trying to
add some levity to this shit.

1149
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:42,510
I'll go fuck myself.

1150
00:57:42,576 --> 00:57:44,578
[whistling]

1151
00:57:44,645 --> 00:57:46,379
It smells so fucking
terrible in here.

1152
00:57:49,983 --> 00:57:51,619
Hey, you guys?

1153
00:57:53,153 --> 00:57:56,489
[stuttering] This says "Stan."

1154
00:57:57,490 --> 00:57:59,526
"For the use
of Losers only."

1155
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,263
Bill.

1156
00:58:12,338 --> 00:58:14,107
- ['80s music playing]
- The fuck is this?

1157
00:58:14,174 --> 00:58:15,375
So you don't get
spiders stuck

1158
00:58:15,442 --> 00:58:16,976
in your hair
when you're down here.

1159
00:58:17,043 --> 00:58:18,111
Stanley, we're not afraid
of fucking spiders.

1160
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:23,082
I stand corrected.

1161
00:58:24,017 --> 00:58:25,218
[laughs] That's a first.

1162
00:58:25,718 --> 00:58:27,320
Touche.

1163
00:58:27,387 --> 00:58:28,988
Hey, Rich,
your ten minutes are up.

1164
00:58:29,055 --> 00:58:30,457
What are you talking about?

1165
00:58:30,523 --> 00:58:32,158
The hammock.
Ten minutes each was the rule.

1166
00:58:32,225 --> 00:58:33,626
- I don't see any sign.
- [Young Eddie] Are you

1167
00:58:33,693 --> 00:58:35,462
being this way right now?
Really? No, no, no.

1168
00:58:35,528 --> 00:58:37,263
Why would there be a sign if
it was a verbal agreement?

1169
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:40,166
And I remember you agreeing
on the fucking rule!

1170
00:58:40,233 --> 00:58:41,668
[both grunting]

1171
00:58:41,734 --> 00:58:43,036
[Young Richie]
I can see your vagina!

1172
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:44,671
[Young Eddie]
Ten minutes each.

1173
00:58:44,737 --> 00:58:46,406
[Young Richie] Go back in
your dumb little corner!

1174
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:48,641
I fucked your mom!

1175
00:58:48,708 --> 00:58:51,544
[Young Eddie] No, you didn't.
Take that back!

1176
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,613
You're awfully good at
this, new kid.

1177
00:58:54,714 --> 00:58:56,048
You really think so?

1178
00:58:57,417 --> 00:58:59,586
There's actually a summer
program in Bar Harbor.

1179
00:58:59,652 --> 00:59:01,421
Teaches you, like,
everything about architecture.

1180
00:59:01,488 --> 00:59:02,722
I was thinking about applying.

1181
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,257
[Young Richie] I'll do that.

1182
00:59:04,324 --> 00:59:07,125
I'll do anything to get
the hell out of Derry.

1183
00:59:07,193 --> 00:59:09,262
Man, when I graduate,
I'm going to Florida.

1184
00:59:09,329 --> 00:59:11,129
What's in Florida, Mike?

1185
00:59:12,197 --> 00:59:13,800
I don't know.

1186
00:59:13,867 --> 00:59:15,602
You know, I guess it's just a
place I always wanted to go.

1187
00:59:15,668 --> 00:59:17,737
Stan, you should go
with Mike to Florida.

1188
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,339
You already act 80.

1189
00:59:19,405 --> 00:59:20,940
You'd clean up with all the grandmas.
[imitates kissing]

1190
00:59:21,006 --> 00:59:22,207
[all laughing]

1191
00:59:24,511 --> 00:59:26,646
Do you guys think
we'll still be friends?

1192
00:59:28,915 --> 00:59:30,249
When we're older?

1193
00:59:30,315 --> 00:59:32,585
[Young Richie] What?

1194
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:35,020
Why wouldn't we be?

1195
00:59:35,087 --> 00:59:36,288
Do any of your parents
still hang out

1196
00:59:36,355 --> 00:59:37,590
with their friends
from middle school?

1197
00:59:39,157 --> 00:59:42,127
I mean, things might
be different then.

1198
00:59:43,262 --> 00:59:45,197
We all might be different.

1199
00:59:46,498 --> 00:59:49,869
We'll always still be friends.

1200
00:59:49,936 --> 00:59:52,204
I don't think that just,
you know,

1201
00:59:52,271 --> 00:59:54,406
[stuttering] goes away
because we get older.

1202
00:59:56,241 --> 00:59:57,677
[Young Beverly]
Yeah, Stan. Come on.

1203
01:00:00,145 --> 01:00:02,815
You don't have
to be so...

1204
01:00:02,882 --> 01:00:04,283
Sad.

1205
01:00:08,253 --> 01:00:10,556
He was old
before his time.

1206
01:00:10,622 --> 01:00:12,591
[Eddie] Yeah.

1207
01:00:12,658 --> 01:00:15,327
I wonder what he was
like all grown up.

1208
01:00:15,394 --> 01:00:17,329
Probably what he
was like as a kid.

1209
01:00:20,833 --> 01:00:21,834
The best.

1210
01:00:23,135 --> 01:00:24,369
Here.

1211
01:00:25,905 --> 01:00:28,273
All right, Mike.
What are we doing here?

1212
01:00:29,575 --> 01:00:30,709
The ritual.

1213
01:00:30,776 --> 01:00:33,211
To perform it
requires a sacrifice.

1214
01:00:33,278 --> 01:00:35,847
- Sacrifice? I nominate Eddie.
- Wait, what?

1215
01:00:35,914 --> 01:00:37,849
Because you're little.
You'll fit on a barbeque.

1216
01:00:37,916 --> 01:00:40,152
I'm 5'9". It's, like,
average height in most of the world.

1217
01:00:40,218 --> 01:00:42,721
It's not that kind of
a sacrifice, guys.

1218
01:00:43,689 --> 01:00:44,823
Mike?

1219
01:00:45,791 --> 01:00:47,526
The past is buried.

1220
01:00:47,593 --> 01:00:49,795
But you're gonna have
to dig it up.

1221
01:00:49,861 --> 01:00:51,863
Piece by piece.

1222
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:53,198
And these pieces,

1223
01:00:53,265 --> 01:00:54,866
these artifacts,

1224
01:00:55,968 --> 01:00:57,469
that's why we're here.

1225
01:00:59,371 --> 01:01:01,139
They are
what you'll sacrifice.

1226
01:01:02,474 --> 01:01:04,676
And since Stan
isn't here to find his...

1227
01:01:04,743 --> 01:01:06,745
I figured we should
all be here together

1228
01:01:06,812 --> 01:01:08,347
to find his artifact.

1229
01:01:10,949 --> 01:01:12,618
I think Bill just did that.

1230
01:01:17,623 --> 01:01:19,725
Okay, Mike, so where
do we find our tokens?

1231
01:01:19,791 --> 01:01:21,493
Yeah, I gotta be honest, man.
All due respect.

1232
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:23,729
This is fucking stupid,
all right?

1233
01:01:23,795 --> 01:01:25,364
Why do we need tokens?
All right?

1234
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:26,965
We already remember
everything.

1235
01:01:27,032 --> 01:01:28,265
Saving Bev,
defeating It...

1236
01:01:28,332 --> 01:01:30,234
I mean,
we're caught up!

1237
01:01:30,301 --> 01:01:31,637
It's not everything.

1238
01:01:33,237 --> 01:01:35,339
We fought.
But what happened after that?

1239
01:01:36,441 --> 01:01:38,376
Before the house
on Neibolt.

1240
01:01:39,678 --> 01:01:40,779
Think.

1241
01:01:42,814 --> 01:01:45,784
[stuttering] We can't
remember, can we?

1242
01:01:45,851 --> 01:01:47,886
See, there's more to our story.

1243
01:01:47,953 --> 01:01:49,320
What happened that summer.

1244
01:01:50,254 --> 01:01:51,957
And those blank spaces,

1245
01:01:52,024 --> 01:01:54,158
like pages torn out of a book.

1246
01:01:54,225 --> 01:01:56,695
That's what
you need to find.

1247
01:01:56,762 --> 01:01:58,462
We need to split up.

1248
01:01:58,529 --> 01:02:00,832
You each need to
find your artifact.

1249
01:02:00,899 --> 01:02:02,801
Alone.
That's important.

1250
01:02:02,868 --> 01:02:03,869
When you do,

1251
01:02:05,202 --> 01:02:06,671
meet me
at the library tonight.

1252
01:02:06,738 --> 01:02:08,606
[Eddie] Yeah,
I gotta say,

1253
01:02:08,673 --> 01:02:10,374
statistically speaking,
you look at survival scenarios,

1254
01:02:10,441 --> 01:02:12,110
we're gonna do much
better as a group.

1255
01:02:12,176 --> 01:02:13,912
Yeah, splitting up
would be dumb, man.

1256
01:02:13,979 --> 01:02:15,814
Okay, we gotta go together.
All right?

1257
01:02:15,881 --> 01:02:17,849
We were together that
summer, right?

1258
01:02:17,916 --> 01:02:20,351
[Bill] No.

1259
01:02:20,418 --> 01:02:24,156
Not that [stutters]
whole summer.

1260
01:02:24,221 --> 01:02:25,756
[Young Bill]
Take it back.

1261
01:02:25,823 --> 01:02:27,324
- [groans]
- [Young Beverly] Bill!

1262
01:02:28,759 --> 01:02:30,494
You're just
a bunch of losers.

1263
01:02:31,096 --> 01:02:32,196
Fuck off!

1264
01:02:32,263 --> 01:02:33,798
- Fucking...
- Stop!

1265
01:02:35,566 --> 01:02:38,269
We were all together
when we hurt It.

1266
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:40,504
That's why
we're still alive.

1267
01:02:40,571 --> 01:02:43,274
Yeah? Well,
I plan to keep it that way.

1268
01:02:52,383 --> 01:02:53,451
[Young Beverly]
I bet by tomorrow,

1269
01:02:53,517 --> 01:02:54,819
we'll all be
back together.

1270
01:02:57,354 --> 01:02:58,856
[stutters] I don't think so.

1271
01:02:58,923 --> 01:03:00,991
Well, if we're gonna stop
It, we better be.

1272
01:03:02,927 --> 01:03:04,428
Maybe Richie was right.

1273
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:09,767
Maybe we shouldn't do anything about
It, or maybe we can't.

1274
01:03:09,834 --> 01:03:12,169
Okay, don't let them
get to you.

1275
01:03:12,236 --> 01:03:13,938
It's a little late
for that.

1276
01:03:17,875 --> 01:03:19,310
You should go.

1277
01:03:20,911 --> 01:03:22,747
Before your dad sees.

1278
01:03:50,241 --> 01:03:51,441
[doorbell rings]

1279
01:03:57,313 --> 01:03:58,515
Yes?

1280
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:01,351
Sorry. I...

1281
01:04:02,887 --> 01:04:04,922
May I help you?

1282
01:04:04,989 --> 01:04:06,289
I thought I rang Marsh.

1283
01:04:06,356 --> 01:04:08,291
Marsh?

1284
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:10,426
Alvin Marsh?

1285
01:04:10,961 --> 01:04:12,428
My father.

1286
01:04:13,164 --> 01:04:14,865
I grew up here.

1287
01:04:21,337 --> 01:04:22,705
Dear,

1288
01:04:22,772 --> 01:04:26,243
it's not for me to
tell you this,

1289
01:04:26,309 --> 01:04:28,645
but your father
passed away.

1290
01:04:30,147 --> 01:04:33,416
I'm so sorry.
You didn't know?

1291
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:39,156
We hadn't spoken
in a while.

1292
01:04:39,223 --> 01:04:41,357
Well, won't you
come in?

1293
01:04:41,424 --> 01:04:43,459
Let me offer you
something to drink.

1294
01:04:43,526 --> 01:04:46,462
No, it's fine.
I have to go.

1295
01:04:46,529 --> 01:04:49,032
It's the least
I can do.

1296
01:04:51,568 --> 01:04:53,369
Sure. Okay.

1297
01:04:57,373 --> 01:04:58,575
[door closes]

1298
01:05:05,348 --> 01:05:07,884
Is it like you remember?

1299
01:05:07,951 --> 01:05:09,719
Cleaner.

1300
01:05:09,786 --> 01:05:11,955
Well, you feel free
to look around

1301
01:05:12,021 --> 01:05:13,857
while I get
the water boiling.

1302
01:05:13,923 --> 01:05:15,558
Oh, really, it's fine.
You don't need to do that.

1303
01:05:15,625 --> 01:05:18,428
Don't be so polite.

1304
01:05:46,689 --> 01:05:48,490
[Mr. Marsh]
Today is her birthday.

1305
01:05:52,662 --> 01:05:54,529
I can still smell
her perfume.

1306
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:00,136
And she'd still be alive
if it wasn't for you.

1307
01:06:02,205 --> 01:06:03,740
Mama was sick.

1308
01:06:03,806 --> 01:06:07,409
You know that's why
she did what she did.

1309
01:06:07,476 --> 01:06:09,645
She did what she did

1310
01:06:09,712 --> 01:06:13,816
because she was embarrassed
to be your mother.

1311
01:06:15,517 --> 01:06:16,986
You look like her.

1312
01:06:19,655 --> 01:06:22,125
But you are nothing
like her.

1313
01:06:24,961 --> 01:06:26,461
Come here.

1314
01:06:28,998 --> 01:06:30,934
I said come here!

1315
01:06:33,635 --> 01:06:35,038
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

1316
01:06:46,481 --> 01:06:47,683
[sniffing]

1317
01:06:50,719 --> 01:06:53,522
You know that I
would never hurt you.

1318
01:06:53,588 --> 01:06:54,856
You know that,
don't you?

1319
01:07:04,633 --> 01:07:07,135
[sobbing] I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1320
01:07:07,203 --> 01:07:10,505
You'll always be my little
girl, won't you?

1321
01:07:11,206 --> 01:07:12,674
Always.

1322
01:08:14,036 --> 01:08:15,037

- [music playing]
- There. I do apologize.

1327
01:08:51,173 --> 01:08:56,511
It gets so very hot
here this time of year.

1328
01:08:56,577 --> 01:08:58,045
It's fine.

1329
01:08:58,113 --> 01:09:01,949
Well, you feel like you
could just about die.

1330
01:09:02,016 --> 01:09:05,119
But you know what
they say about Derry.

1331
01:09:05,187 --> 01:09:09,324
"No one who dies here
ever really dies."

[clock ticking]

1333
01:09:21,902 --> 01:09:25,373
But tell me,
how is it being back in Derry?

1334
01:09:27,576 --> 01:09:29,544
It's good.
Strange.

1335
01:09:29,610 --> 01:09:31,480
Strange?

1336
01:09:31,546 --> 01:09:32,813
Oh, my.

1337
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,282
Strange, how?

1338
01:09:36,984 --> 01:09:39,053
- [oven timer dings]
- [Mrs. Kersh] Oh.

1339
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:42,223
I had some cookies in
the oven before you came.

1340
01:09:42,289 --> 01:09:43,624
You stay right there.

1341
01:09:43,691 --> 01:09:45,860
I really... I shouldn't impose...
I'm gonna...

1342
01:09:45,926 --> 01:09:48,696
No, no, no. I insist.

Mrs. Kersh,
are these your family?

1345
01:09:56,270 --> 01:09:57,738
Yes, dear.

1346
01:09:57,805 --> 01:10:01,809
My father came to this country
with $14 in his pocket.

1347
01:10:01,876 --> 01:10:04,111
And he didn't ask
for a handout

1348
01:10:04,178 --> 01:10:06,881
the way that people
come in here these days.

1349
01:10:06,947 --> 01:10:08,549
You know what he did?

1350
01:10:08,616 --> 01:10:10,718
What did he do,
Mrs. Kersh?

1351
01:10:10,784 --> 01:10:13,821
My father joined the circus.

1352

You haven't
changed their futures.

You... You haven't
saved any of them.

1369

1582
01:26:31,023 --> 01:26:33,625
Well, yeah,
of course, dummy.

1583
01:26:38,364 --> 01:26:39,698
You and me.

1584
01:26:45,371 --> 01:26:46,771
Oh, my God!

1585
01:26:48,608 --> 01:26:49,975
I meant as a friend.

1586
01:26:51,743 --> 01:26:53,246
You actually thought
I could like someone

1587
01:26:53,312 --> 01:26:57,316
as fat and gross and
disgusting like you?

1588
01:26:57,383 --> 01:26:58,850
[lighter clicking]

1589
01:26:58,917 --> 01:27:00,685
No matter
how many stupid poems

1590
01:27:00,752 --> 01:27:01,987
[demonic voice] you write.

1591
01:27:03,722 --> 01:27:04,923
[gasps]

1592
01:27:09,728 --> 01:27:11,863
"Your hair is winter fire.

1593
01:27:18,236 --> 01:27:19,804
"January embers.

1594
01:27:22,207 --> 01:27:24,843
"My heart
burns there, too."

1595
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:35,854
[panting]

1596
01:27:50,135 --> 01:27:52,103
That's not the real Beverly.

1597
01:27:52,170 --> 01:27:54,773
Beverly would never
say anything like that.

1598
01:27:54,839 --> 01:27:56,274
She'd never say that.

1599
01:28:11,122 --> 01:28:13,825
- [screams]
- Kiss me, fat boy.

1600
01:28:13,892 --> 01:28:15,393
- [yells]
- [screams]

01:28:19,264 --> 01:28:20,298
[grunting]

1603
01:28:23,902 --> 01:28:29,341
Oh, nobody wants to
kiss the fat boy.

1604
01:28:29,407 --> 01:28:30,709
Just leave me alone.

1605
01:28:30,774 --> 01:28:32,611
Alone?

1606
01:28:32,677 --> 01:28:36,715
Oh, you've always
been alone.

1607
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:39,950
That's not true.
I have real friends.

1608
01:28:40,018 --> 01:28:41,952
Bill. Eddie. Mike. Stanley.
Richie. Beverly.

1609
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:43,854
They're my real friends.

1610
01:28:43,921 --> 01:28:47,626
Kiss me as if it
were the last time.

1611
01:28:47,692 --> 01:28:49,227
[grunting]

1612
01:28:49,294 --> 01:28:50,462
[roars]

1613
01:28:54,999 --> 01:28:56,834
[janitor] What the hell
are you doing, kid?

1614
01:28:58,603 --> 01:28:59,903
[exhales]

1615
01:29:03,642 --> 01:29:05,075
[sniffling]

1616
01:29:08,812 --> 01:29:09,980
[door opens]

1617
01:29:13,385 --> 01:29:14,918
Guys?

1618
01:29:15,687 --> 01:29:16,887
[Beverly] Hey.

1619
01:29:18,490 --> 01:29:19,857
[Ben] Hey.

1620
01:29:21,326 --> 01:29:23,628
So, what did you see
out there?

1621
01:29:23,695 --> 01:29:25,796
Something I wish
I hadn't.

1622
01:29:29,434 --> 01:29:30,834
So, what, we just...

1623
01:29:33,738 --> 01:29:37,875
We kill It, and then we just
forget everything again?

1624
01:29:37,941 --> 01:29:40,244
I hope so.
Don't you?

1625
01:29:40,311 --> 01:29:42,547
I don't know.

1626
01:29:42,614 --> 01:29:45,482
I guess I want to hold on
to the good stuff, you know?

1627
01:29:45,550 --> 01:29:46,850
Mmm.

1628
01:29:46,917 --> 01:29:48,319
Come on.
There must be something from

1629
01:29:48,385 --> 01:29:50,454
the past that you don't
want to forget again.

1630
01:29:52,323 --> 01:29:54,525
I remember
being scared shitless.

1631
01:29:55,492 --> 01:29:57,928
Cold.

1632
01:29:57,995 --> 01:30:00,464
I remember you guys
in your tighty-whities.

1633
01:30:00,531 --> 01:30:03,434
Okay. Please forget
that moment.

1634
01:30:05,069 --> 01:30:07,271
I remember this.

1635
01:30:09,506 --> 01:30:12,276
I remember the boy
who wrote it for me.

1636
01:30:14,712 --> 01:30:16,513
Not him, so much,

1637
01:30:18,783 --> 01:30:20,984
but how he made me feel.

1638
01:30:23,921 --> 01:30:25,989
And a kiss.

1639
01:30:30,761 --> 01:30:34,631
It's still blurry,
but I think the longer we're here,

1640
01:30:34,698 --> 01:30:36,467
the more I can see it.

1641
01:30:36,533 --> 01:30:38,901
The more I can see that moment.

1642
01:30:38,969 --> 01:30:40,404
The more
I can see...

1643
01:30:41,438 --> 01:30:42,439
Bill.

1644
01:30:45,409 --> 01:30:46,543
I think.

1645
01:30:48,846 --> 01:30:51,548
I don't know.
Do you remember...

1646
01:30:53,384 --> 01:30:55,552
- [door opens]
- Bev, um...

1647
01:30:57,053 --> 01:30:59,021
- Move. Move.
- [Beverly] What's wrong?

1648
01:30:59,088 --> 01:31:01,158
I'm leaving.

1649
01:31:01,225 --> 01:31:02,760
[Ben] What?
You can't leave, man.

1650
01:31:02,826 --> 01:31:04,395
We split,
we all die.

1651
01:31:04,461 --> 01:31:06,497
Yeah, I'll take my chances.
We're gonna die, anyway.

1652
01:31:07,130 --> 01:31:09,366
Rich. Um...

1653
01:31:11,468 --> 01:31:13,035
Rich.

1654
01:31:14,538 --> 01:31:17,173
Hey, kids!
It's Burrow the Beaver!

1655
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:19,443
Come on down.
It's the last day

1656
01:31:19,510 --> 01:31:21,879
of the festival here
at Canal Days.

1657
01:31:21,978 --> 01:31:23,614
[upbeat music playing]

1658
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:24,681
Ahh!

1659
01:31:25,349 --> 01:31:26,450
Asshole!

1660
01:31:32,656 --> 01:31:34,591
[Muzak playing]

1661
01:31:40,129 --> 01:31:41,598
- [ripping]
- Hello?

1662
01:31:42,999 --> 01:31:44,200
[sniffing]

1663
01:31:53,777 --> 01:31:55,077
Can I help you?

1664
01:31:55,144 --> 01:31:56,579
Yeah, I called in...

1665
01:31:56,647 --> 01:31:58,314
I had prescription
called in for Kaspbrak.

1666
01:31:58,782 --> 01:31:59,982
Kaspbrak?

1667
01:32:00,049 --> 01:32:01,250
It's an inhaler.

1668
01:32:02,786 --> 01:32:05,889
Uh... Eddie Kaspbrak?

1669
01:32:05,955 --> 01:32:07,523
Mmm-hmm.
That's me.

1670
01:32:08,826 --> 01:32:10,026
I remember you.

1671
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:11,627
Yeah.

1672
01:32:11,694 --> 01:32:13,262
- Mmm-hmm.
- How's your mom?

1673
01:32:13,329 --> 01:32:15,097
Oh, uh...
Well, she died a few years ago.

1674
01:32:15,164 --> 01:32:16,532
It's very sad.
It was from liver cancer.

1675
01:32:16,599 --> 01:32:17,801
What's that?

1676
01:32:17,868 --> 01:32:19,969
- What's what?
- That.

1677
01:32:21,237 --> 01:32:23,005
- All right.
- Uh-huh.

1678
01:32:23,072 --> 01:32:24,307
- Okay.
- [grunts]

1679
01:32:24,373 --> 01:32:26,642
No, it's not gonna pop.
It's a mole.

1680
01:32:26,709 --> 01:32:28,845
It might not be cancer.

1681
01:32:28,912 --> 01:32:30,112
Cancer?

1682
01:32:32,482 --> 01:32:34,016
But it might be.

1683
01:32:34,083 --> 01:32:35,885
You just stay here.

1684
01:32:35,953 --> 01:32:37,920
I'll get you something.

1685
01:32:37,987 --> 01:32:39,255
[squeaking]

1686
01:32:39,722 --> 01:32:41,023
Okay.

1687
01:32:50,399 --> 01:32:52,668
You came here for your
stinky breath pills?

1688
01:32:54,170 --> 01:32:56,372
[stammers] My breath
is fine.

1689
01:32:56,439 --> 01:32:58,207
Thank you.

1690
01:32:58,274 --> 01:33:00,943
That's not
what my dad said.

1691
01:33:01,009 --> 01:33:03,011
He said you have a tumor.

1692
01:33:05,648 --> 01:33:06,949
On your dick.

1693
01:33:07,015 --> 01:33:08,116
[laughs]

1694
01:33:08,183 --> 01:33:10,486
But you don't
take pills for...

1695
01:33:12,455 --> 01:33:13,756
Wait, what did
your dad say?

1696
01:33:14,757 --> 01:33:16,024
There you go.

1697
01:33:17,326 --> 01:33:18,561
I hope your dick
feels better.

1698
01:33:20,796 --> 01:33:22,163
Thank you.

1699
01:33:23,533 --> 01:33:26,802
For the inhaler,
not for the penis thing.

1700
01:33:26,869 --> 01:33:29,070
[Mrs. Kaspbrak] Eddie!

1701
01:33:32,073 --> 01:33:34,175

[Mrs. Kaspbrak] Eddie?

1721
01:34:44,245 --> 01:34:45,914
[Young Eddie] The fuck
is she doing here?

1722
01:34:45,981 --> 01:34:47,315
What is taking you
so long?

1723
01:34:47,382 --> 01:34:49,451
I don't know.
Why are you here?

1724
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:00,428
Mommy!

1725
01:35:00,495 --> 01:35:02,197

01:47:17,025 --> 01:47:19,428
- Good morning, Mike.
- How you doing?

1936
01:47:19,495 --> 01:47:21,397
<i>...the whispers we wish
we could silence...</i>

1937
01:47:21,464 --> 01:47:24,933
His pa is the one.
The one that set that fire.

1938
01:47:27,001 --> 01:47:30,271
<i>...the nightmares we most
want to wake up from,</i>

1939
01:47:32,708 --> 01:47:35,611
<i>the memories we wish
we could change...</i>

1940
01:47:40,181 --> 01:47:43,151
<i>...the secrets we feel
like we have to keep</i>

1941
01:47:45,220 --> 01:47:47,989
<i>are the hardest to
walk away from.</i>

1942
01:47:51,861 --> 01:47:54,396
<i>The good stuff?</i>

1943
01:47:54,462 --> 01:47:58,667
<i>The pictures in our mind
that fade away the fastest?</i>

1944
01:47:58,734 --> 01:48:02,337
<i>Those pieces of you it
feels the easiest to lose.</i>

1945
01:48:04,038 --> 01:48:07,075
- <i>Maybe I don't want to forget.</i>
- [camera clicking]

1946
01:48:09,110 --> 01:48:12,414
Maybe if that's what
today is all about,

1947
01:48:14,682 --> 01:48:16,584
forget it, right?

1948
01:48:16,651 --> 01:48:18,286
- Thank you, Stanley.
- [stammering]

1949
01:48:18,353 --> 01:48:20,021
Today, I'm supposed
to become a man,

1950
01:48:20,088 --> 01:48:23,091
but I don't feel
any different.

1951
01:48:25,059 --> 01:48:27,162
I know I'm a loser.

1952
01:48:27,228 --> 01:48:29,431
And no matter what,

1953
01:48:29,497 --> 01:48:31,433
- I always fucking will be.
- [congregants gasp]

1954
01:48:51,820 --> 01:48:53,688
Thanks for showing up,
Stanley.

1955
01:49:35,229 --> 01:49:37,599
[Mrs. Hanlon] <i>Mike! Help!</i>

1956
01:49:37,665 --> 01:49:39,333
[Mrs. Hanlon screaming]

1957
01:49:39,399 --> 01:49:40,568
Help us!

1958
01:49:40,635 --> 01:49:43,838
- Please, Mikey, get help!
- [Mr. Hanlon] Help us!

1959
01:49:43,905 --> 01:49:46,975
Please, Mikey,
get help!

1960
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:48,342
- [Mrs. Hanlon] Mikey!
- [both scream]

1961
01:49:54,114 --> 01:49:55,617
[Henry yelling]

1962
01:50:05,526 --> 01:50:06,527
[groans]

1963
01:50:09,898 --> 01:50:11,164
[laughing]

1964
01:50:13,667 --> 01:50:16,470
You should
have burned, Mike.

1965
01:50:16,537 --> 01:50:17,538
[yelling]

1966
01:50:22,977 --> 01:50:24,545
Just like
your druggie parents.

1967
01:50:24,611 --> 01:50:27,347
- [grunting]
- Can you see them yet?

1968
01:50:27,414 --> 01:50:28,749
[laughing] Crisping?

1969
01:50:28,815 --> 01:50:30,250
[both grunting]

1970
01:50:30,317 --> 01:50:32,486
Like fried fucking...

1971
01:50:32,553 --> 01:50:33,554
[groans]

1972
01:50:41,228 --> 01:50:42,429
[thuds]

1973
01:50:44,498 --> 01:50:47,167
I guess you could say
that was long overdue.

1974
01:50:47,234 --> 01:50:49,069
Get it?
'Cause we're in a library.

1975
01:50:49,136 --> 01:50:50,704
[retches] No.

1976
01:50:51,972 --> 01:50:53,173
Oh...

1977
01:50:55,676 --> 01:50:56,910
[Beverly] Mike?

1978
01:50:56,977 --> 01:50:59,179
- [Ben] Hey.
- [Beverly] Hey. Oh, my God.

1979
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:01,481
[Beverly screams]

1980
01:51:03,250 --> 01:51:05,151
[Beverly panting]

1981
01:51:05,218 --> 01:51:06,820
Are you all right?

1982
01:51:06,887 --> 01:51:08,589
No, I'm not all right.
I just fucking killed a guy.

1983
01:51:09,756 --> 01:51:11,258
I was talking to Mike.

1984
01:51:13,327 --> 01:51:14,828
Where's Bill?

1985
01:51:16,195 --> 01:51:18,665
- [cell phone ringing]
- [clears throat]

1986
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:21,835
Bill, we're all
at the library.

1987
01:51:21,902 --> 01:51:23,337
Where are you at?

1988
01:51:23,403 --> 01:51:25,639
[stuttering] He took a little
kid, Mike.

1989
01:51:25,706 --> 01:51:29,275
He took a little kid right
in fucking front of me.

1990
01:51:29,342 --> 01:51:31,110
No, no, no, no, no.
Just, just...

1991
01:51:31,177 --> 01:51:32,546
Look, just come here
to the library.

1992
01:51:32,613 --> 01:51:34,113
We can talk about
the plan.

1993
01:51:34,180 --> 01:51:36,282
- I'm gonna go kill It.
- <i>No, no, no.</i>

1994
01:51:36,349 --> 01:51:40,152
I don't want any of you
to get killed with me.

1995
01:51:40,219 --> 01:51:41,588
<i>Bill! Bill!</i>

1996
01:51:46,359 --> 01:51:47,995
He's going
to fight It alone.

1997
01:51:48,061 --> 01:51:50,429
- What?
- [Mike] Alone.

1998
01:51:50,496 --> 01:51:51,765
It's about the group.

1999
01:51:51,832 --> 01:51:53,265
The ritual doesn't work
without the group.

2000
01:51:53,332 --> 01:51:54,901
Doing it together
is why it'd work.

2001
01:51:58,839 --> 01:52:01,273
Mike, did he tell you
where he was going?

2002
01:52:01,340 --> 01:52:03,175
If he really wanted
to kill Pennywise,

2003
01:52:03,242 --> 01:52:04,778
there's only one place
he'll go.

2004
01:52:04,845 --> 01:52:06,713
The same place the ritual
needs to be performed.

2005
01:52:06,780 --> 01:52:09,215
Oh, we're not gonna like
this, are we?

2006
01:52:10,182 --> 01:52:11,651
[sighs] Fuck.

2007
01:52:31,537 --> 01:52:33,339
[breathing heavily]

2008
01:52:41,114 --> 01:52:42,982
[Beverly] Bill!

2009
01:52:43,050 --> 01:52:45,085
No, no,
you guys, no!

2010
01:52:45,152 --> 01:52:47,154
[stuttering]
I started all this.

2011
01:52:47,219 --> 01:52:49,989
It's my fault that
you're all here.

2012
01:52:50,057 --> 01:52:53,492
This curse, this fucking
thing that's inside you all.

2013
01:52:53,559 --> 01:52:55,528
It started growing
the day

2014
01:52:55,594 --> 01:52:57,130
that I made you go
down to the Barrens

2015
01:52:57,196 --> 01:53:01,834
because all I cared about
was finding Georgie.

2016
01:53:03,269 --> 01:53:04,737
Now, I'm gonna
go in there,

2017
01:53:04,804 --> 01:53:06,472
and I don't know
what's gonna happen,

2018
01:53:06,539 --> 01:53:09,341
but I can't ask you
to do this.

2019
01:53:11,410 --> 01:53:12,745
[Beverly] Well,

2020
01:53:12,812 --> 01:53:14,980
we're not asking you,
either.

2021
01:53:15,047 --> 01:53:16,082
- Bev...
- We didn't

2022
01:53:16,148 --> 01:53:17,683
do it alone
then, Bill,

2023
01:53:17,750 --> 01:53:20,386
so we're not gonna
do this alone now.

2024
01:53:20,453 --> 01:53:22,688
Losers stick together.

2025
01:53:28,259 --> 01:53:30,930
So, does somebody
want to say something?

2026
01:53:32,765 --> 01:53:35,901
Richie said it best
when we were here last.

2027
01:53:35,968 --> 01:53:37,335
I did?

2028
01:53:38,904 --> 01:53:41,707
- "I don't want to die"?
- Not that.

2029
01:53:41,774 --> 01:53:43,542
"You're lucky we're
not measuring dicks"?

2030
01:53:45,010 --> 01:53:46,511
[Bill] No.

2031
01:53:48,547 --> 01:53:49,982
"Let's kill
this fucking clown"?

2032
01:53:53,919 --> 01:53:56,588
Let's kill this
fucking clown.

2033
01:54:21,412 --> 01:54:22,882
[Richie] Hmm.

2034
01:54:22,948 --> 01:54:24,549
Well, I love what he's
done with the place.

2035
01:54:25,283 --> 01:54:26,417
Beep-beep, Richie.

2036
01:54:26,484 --> 01:54:27,752
All right.

2037
01:54:46,771 --> 01:54:48,873
Hey, hey.
That's the basement, right?

2038
01:54:52,144 --> 01:54:53,411
[groaning]

2039
01:54:54,846 --> 01:54:56,581
[Beverly] Ben?

2040
01:54:56,648 --> 01:54:58,883
[Eddie] No, no!
Hey, hey! Ben!

2041
01:54:58,950 --> 01:55:00,051
[both] Ben!

2042
01:55:00,118 --> 01:55:01,119
Ben? What's wrong?

2043
01:55:01,187 --> 01:55:03,388
[continues groaning]

2044
01:55:03,454 --> 01:55:05,657
- Ben!
- Okay. All right.

2045
01:55:05,723 --> 01:55:07,358
- [Bill] Ben!
- [rattling]

2046
01:55:13,498 --> 01:55:15,500
Okay, that can't
be good, right?

2047
01:55:15,567 --> 01:55:16,868
- [Ben continues groaning]
- [Beverly gasping]

2048
01:55:16,935 --> 01:55:18,670
Help! Hey!

2049
01:55:19,470 --> 01:55:20,672
[whimpers]

2050
01:55:21,406 --> 01:55:22,774
[pounding on fridge door]

2051
01:55:25,310 --> 01:55:26,511
[both] Ugh!

2052
01:55:33,184 --> 01:55:34,384
It's Stan.

2053
01:55:36,554 --> 01:55:38,089
- [Ben screaming]
- [whimpering]

2054
01:55:38,156 --> 01:55:39,356
[Beverly] It can't
be real.

2055
01:55:40,992 --> 01:55:43,027
- [yelling]
- Oh!

2056
01:55:44,562 --> 01:55:45,997
- [all yelping]
- Oh, God.

2057
01:55:46,064 --> 01:55:47,131
Shit.

2058
01:55:52,337 --> 01:55:53,738
[hyperventilating]

2059
01:55:55,372 --> 01:55:57,809
I'd still be alive if
it wasn't for you, Bill.

2060
01:55:58,943 --> 01:55:59,944
No.

2061
01:56:04,349 --> 01:56:05,683
- Beverly!
- [screaming]

2062
01:56:07,118 --> 01:56:08,418
[Pennywise laughing]

2063
01:56:08,953 --> 01:56:10,420
[Ben whimpering]

2064
01:56:12,290 --> 01:56:13,490
[knife unsheathing]

2065
01:56:15,193 --> 01:56:16,294
[screaming]

2066
01:56:16,361 --> 01:56:17,561
[grunting]

2067
01:56:25,904 --> 01:56:27,537
[cracking]

2068
01:56:27,604 --> 01:56:29,806
Richie, what's happening to me?

2069
01:56:31,209 --> 01:56:32,409
[groaning]

2070
01:56:49,626 --> 01:56:52,196
You gotta be
fucking kidding.

2071
01:56:52,263 --> 01:56:53,830
[laughing]

2072
01:56:57,501 --> 01:56:59,803
[yelps] Fuck!

2073
01:57:01,239 --> 01:57:04,608
Oh, God damn it, get it away from me.
Oh, God!

2074
01:57:06,377 --> 01:57:07,511
[snarling]

2075
01:57:07,577 --> 01:57:09,613
Whoa, whoa!
[yelping]

2076
01:57:11,481 --> 01:57:13,183
[panting]

- [footsteps retreating]
- [Pennywise laughing]

2078
01:57:20,290 --> 01:57:21,426
Eddie.

2079
01:57:21,491 --> 01:57:23,627
Hey. Are you okay?

2080
01:57:24,127 --> 01:57:25,128
I'm...

2081
01:57:30,334 --> 01:57:31,568
Oh, there he is.

2082
01:57:32,202 --> 01:57:33,870
[screaming]

2083
01:57:35,305 --> 01:57:36,506
Get it off of me!

2084
01:57:36,573 --> 01:57:37,507
- [Bill grunting]
- [continues screaming]

2085
01:57:37,574 --> 01:57:39,176
Get it off of me!

2086
01:57:41,144 --> 01:57:42,079
[Ben] Richie!

2087
01:57:42,145 --> 01:57:44,448
- [Mike] Richie!
- Richie! Hey!

2088
01:57:44,514 --> 01:57:45,949
- [Bill grunting]
- [Richie screaming]

2089
01:57:47,117 --> 01:57:48,785
- [Richie] Get it off of me!
- I wanna go home.

2090
01:57:50,354 --> 01:57:51,855
Get the knife!

2091
01:57:51,922 --> 01:57:53,690
God damn it, Eddie,
get the knife!

2092
01:57:53,757 --> 01:57:56,259
Bill! Get it off of me, Bill!
Quick! [screaming]

2093
01:57:58,762 --> 01:58:00,529
- Eddie, get the knife!
- [grunts]

2094
01:58:01,164 --> 01:58:02,733
Ahh! Fuck!

2095
01:58:07,904 --> 01:58:09,538
- [grunting]
- [Young Stanley groaning]

2096

[panting]

2099
01:58:23,420 --> 01:58:24,421
[Beverly] What?

2100
01:58:24,488 --> 01:58:25,688
[grunts]

2101
01:58:29,359 --> 01:58:30,760

2103
01:58:36,299 --> 01:58:38,101
Is everybody okay?

2104
01:58:38,168 --> 01:58:40,971
- [coughing]
- [Bill] You all right?

2105
01:58:41,038 --> 01:58:43,340
[stuttering] He could have
fucking died, man.

2106
01:58:43,407 --> 01:58:44,540
You know that, right?

2107
01:58:44,607 --> 01:58:46,176
I can't see.

2108
01:58:46,243 --> 01:58:49,879
Georgie's dead. The kid's dead.
Stanley's dead.

2109
01:58:49,945 --> 01:58:52,482
You want Richie, too?
You want Richie, too?

2110
01:58:52,548 --> 01:58:54,817
I don't want Richie, too.
I don't. I don't.

2111
01:58:59,555 --> 01:59:01,557
Please don't
be mad, Bill.

2112
01:59:05,462 --> 01:59:07,330
I was just scared.
[crying]

2113
01:59:09,832 --> 01:59:12,768
That's what
he wants, right?

2114
01:59:15,237 --> 01:59:17,173
Don't give it to him.

2115
01:59:29,718 --> 01:59:31,320
A lot of memories, huh?

2116
01:59:33,589 --> 01:59:34,890
All bad.

2117
01:59:38,427 --> 01:59:40,196
[rats squeaking]

2118
01:59:47,603 --> 01:59:48,838
[Eddie] Oh, man.

2119
01:59:50,339 --> 01:59:52,308
Blech. Gray water.

2120
02:00:30,613 --> 02:00:32,047
Shit. This is it.

2121
02:00:34,016 --> 02:00:35,251
This is where
it happened.

2122
02:00:51,133 --> 02:00:52,700
No, no, no.

2123
02:00:52,767 --> 02:00:54,336
No. Ugh!

2124
02:01:02,911 --> 02:01:04,213
[Pennywise] Bevvie.

2125
02:01:13,622 --> 02:01:14,822
Bev, what is it?

2126
02:01:20,061 --> 02:01:21,664
I thought
I heard something.

2127
02:01:21,729 --> 02:01:23,264
- [screaming]
- [laughing]

2128
02:01:24,199 --> 02:01:25,568
Bev!

2129
02:01:25,634 --> 02:01:27,001
Time to sink!

2130
02:01:27,068 --> 02:01:28,269
- [laughs]
- [screams]

2131
02:01:30,705 --> 02:01:32,106
[Mike] Bev!

2132
02:01:34,008 --> 02:01:35,243
[echoing] Guys.

2133
02:01:38,447 --> 02:01:40,114
Okay, guys.
Come on.

2134
02:01:44,587 --> 02:01:46,354
Hey, guys.

2135
02:01:46,421 --> 02:01:48,523
Guys, come on.
[crying] Please, come on.

2136
02:01:48,591 --> 02:01:50,391
I don't want to walk
out of here alone.

2137
02:01:50,992 --> 02:01:52,293
[all gasping]

2138
02:01:54,229 --> 02:01:55,964
- You okay?
- [Beverly crying]

2139
02:01:56,030 --> 02:01:58,233
I feel like crying.

2140
02:01:58,299 --> 02:02:01,102
Mike. Where do we go from here?

2141
02:02:08,142 --> 02:02:09,877
[Mike] In the depths
is where It crept.

2142
02:02:09,944 --> 02:02:11,746
In the beneath,
to find belief.

2143
02:02:11,813 --> 02:02:13,114
In the depths
is where It crept.

2144
02:02:13,181 --> 02:02:14,649
In the beneath,
to find belief.

2145
02:02:14,716 --> 02:02:16,184
Is he okay?

2146
02:02:16,251 --> 02:02:18,119
I think at this point,
that's a relative question.

2147
02:02:18,186 --> 02:02:19,954
What's on
the other side?

2148
02:02:20,021 --> 02:02:22,390
I don't know.
No one does.

2149
02:02:25,226 --> 02:02:26,427
[Bill] Whoa,
whoa, whoa!

2150
02:02:27,262 --> 02:02:28,263
Mike.

2151
02:02:33,368 --> 02:02:35,403
- Mike, don't.
- All right.

2152
02:02:35,470 --> 02:02:36,770
- See you down there.
- [all] Mike!

2153
02:02:36,837 --> 02:02:38,072
Wait! [stammers]

2154
02:02:44,245 --> 02:02:46,514
- Stay together.
- Okay.

2155
02:02:49,617 --> 02:02:50,851
You guys,
I can't do it.

2156
02:02:52,953 --> 02:02:55,089
I can't.
You saw what happened up there.

2157
02:02:55,156 --> 02:02:57,225
I was gonna
let you die.

2158
02:02:57,292 --> 02:02:59,193
I just fucking
froze up.

2159
02:02:59,260 --> 02:03:01,296
If you let me go
down there with you,

2160
02:03:01,362 --> 02:03:02,896
I'm gonna get us all killed.
[inhales deeply]

2161
02:03:02,963 --> 02:03:04,064
Hey, hey, hey.
Give me that.

2162
02:03:04,131 --> 02:03:05,132
- Give me that.
- Richie.

2163
02:03:05,199 --> 02:03:06,833
Let go,
you little turd.

2164
02:03:06,900 --> 02:03:08,670
- Just let me get...
- [inhaler spraying]

2165
02:03:08,736 --> 02:03:10,003
[inhales deeply]

2166
02:03:10,070 --> 02:03:11,272
- I got it.
- Stop.

2167
02:03:12,005 --> 02:03:13,541
Listen to me.

2168
02:03:13,608 --> 02:03:15,175
You had a moment.
Fine.

2169
02:03:15,242 --> 02:03:18,045
But who killed a psychotic
clown before he was 14?

2170
02:03:19,580 --> 02:03:20,715
Me.

2171
02:03:20,782 --> 02:03:21,848
Who stabbed Bowers
with a knife

2172
02:03:21,915 --> 02:03:23,183
he pulled out
of his own face?

2173
02:03:23,250 --> 02:03:24,519
Also me.

2174
02:03:24,585 --> 02:03:26,286
Who married a woman 10
times his own body mass?

2175
02:03:28,855 --> 02:03:30,458
- Me.
- Yeah.

2176
02:03:33,494 --> 02:03:35,896
You're braver
than you think.

2177
02:03:35,962 --> 02:03:37,164
All right.
Thanks, Rich.

2178
02:03:38,098 --> 02:03:40,133
- Ow.
- Sorry.

2179
02:03:42,637 --> 02:03:43,771
[Beverly] Hey.
Here.

2180
02:03:43,837 --> 02:03:44,905
Take it.

2181
02:03:44,971 --> 02:03:46,873
It kills monsters.

2182
02:03:48,875 --> 02:03:51,111
- Does it?
- Yeah.

2183
02:03:51,178 --> 02:03:52,846
If you believe
it does.

2184
02:03:54,414 --> 02:03:55,482
Thanks, Bev.

2185
02:04:13,700 --> 02:04:14,836
[Mike echoing] You guys good?

2186
02:04:14,901 --> 02:04:16,169
[Bill] Yeah.

2187
02:04:20,707 --> 02:04:21,809
Can you get through that?

2188
02:04:21,875 --> 02:04:22,943
[Mike] It's the only way.
This way.

2189
02:04:23,009 --> 02:04:24,544
It's in here!

2190
02:04:28,482 --> 02:04:29,616
Through here.

2191
02:04:29,683 --> 02:04:31,585
It's tight,
but we can get through.

2192
02:04:47,134 --> 02:04:49,001
This is where It hid.

2193
02:05:09,589 --> 02:05:13,926
So, all this has been under
Derry, like, forever?

2194
02:05:13,993 --> 02:05:15,829
Not forever.

2195
02:05:15,896 --> 02:05:17,330
Just a few million years.

2196
02:05:53,265 --> 02:05:56,368
It can only be
attacked in its true form.

2197
02:05:56,435 --> 02:05:57,536
The ritual
will show us that.

2198
02:05:57,603 --> 02:05:59,205
And what is
It's true form?

2199
02:05:59,271 --> 02:06:01,106
I hope it's a puppy.

2200
02:06:01,173 --> 02:06:03,476
Like a Pomeranian or...

2201
02:06:03,542 --> 02:06:04,543
I'll shut up.

2202
02:06:05,544 --> 02:06:06,579
It's light.

2203
02:06:10,416 --> 02:06:12,485
A light that must be
snuffed out by darkness.

2204
02:06:25,664 --> 02:06:26,665
Your artifacts.

2205
02:06:28,267 --> 02:06:30,436
Place them in the fire.

2206
02:06:30,503 --> 02:06:32,571
The past must
burn with the present.

2207
02:06:41,013 --> 02:06:44,283
This is the boat
that I built

2208
02:06:46,719 --> 02:06:48,220
with Georgie.

2209
02:06:52,825 --> 02:06:55,094
[Eddie] It's my inhaler.

2210
02:06:58,029 --> 02:06:59,331
[inhales deeply]

2211
02:07:00,332 --> 02:07:01,500
Come on, dude.

2212
02:07:04,102 --> 02:07:06,338
Something that
I wish I had held on to.

2213
02:07:12,011 --> 02:07:14,914
This is a page
from my yearbook.

2214
02:07:14,980 --> 02:07:17,583
That only
one person signed.

2215
02:07:17,650 --> 02:07:20,986
I probably should
have forgotten it,

2216
02:07:21,052 --> 02:07:23,522
but I couldn't,
because I kept it in my wallet

2217
02:07:25,323 --> 02:07:26,825
for 27 years.

2218
02:07:33,131 --> 02:07:34,700
This is a token
from the Capitol Theater.

2219
02:07:34,767 --> 02:07:36,401
- You brought an actual token?
- [Richie] Yeah, man.

2220
02:07:36,468 --> 02:07:38,102
That's what we were supposed to
do, asshole.

2221
02:07:38,169 --> 02:07:39,772
Do you have any idea how long
that's gonna take to burn?

2222
02:07:39,838 --> 02:07:41,272
Yeah, but so is your
inhaler, dude.

2223
02:07:41,339 --> 02:07:42,975
Guys, come on.

2224
02:07:43,042 --> 02:07:44,843
All the toxic fumes and
the plastic and shit, so...

2225
02:07:47,780 --> 02:07:48,781
Look closely, Bev.

2226
02:07:50,248 --> 02:07:52,150
You see it?

2227
02:07:52,216 --> 02:07:53,652
That's where
you hit Bowers.

2228
02:07:55,654 --> 02:07:56,655
The rock fight.

2229
02:07:59,157 --> 02:08:01,092
The day these bonds were forged.

2230
02:08:02,061 --> 02:08:03,561
That's not
gonna burn, either.

2231
02:08:09,100 --> 02:08:10,301
Oh, wait.

2232
02:08:13,705 --> 02:08:15,206
Couldn't forget
about Stan,

2233
02:08:15,941 --> 02:08:17,208
again.

2234
02:08:22,180 --> 02:08:23,815
[Mike] Okay.

2235
02:08:23,882 --> 02:08:24,883
Grab hands.

2236
02:08:26,584 --> 02:08:27,619
Come on.

2237
02:08:35,226 --> 02:08:37,328
The Ritual of Chud.

2238
02:08:37,395 --> 02:08:40,198
It's a battle of wills.

2239
02:08:40,264 --> 02:08:42,734
The first step
was our reunion.

2240
02:08:42,800 --> 02:08:46,604
The second was
the gathering of tokens.

2241
02:08:48,473 --> 02:08:50,508
This is the final step.

2242
02:08:53,344 --> 02:08:54,545
What the...

2243
02:09:03,287 --> 02:09:04,922
Fuck is that?

2244
02:09:04,989 --> 02:09:06,357
- [Mike] Don't look at them!
- [Eddie] Are those

2245
02:09:06,424 --> 02:09:08,059
- the Deadlights?
- Don't look at it!

2246
02:09:08,126 --> 02:09:09,761
Okay.

2247
02:09:09,827 --> 02:09:11,462
Turn light into dark.
Turn light into dark. Say it!

2248
02:09:11,529 --> 02:09:13,131
- [Eddie] Say what?
- Say it!

2249
02:09:13,230 --> 02:09:14,666
[all] Turn light
into dark.

2250
02:09:14,732 --> 02:09:16,567
[Mike chanting
in native language]

2251
02:09:16,634 --> 02:09:18,268
[others in English]
Turn light into dark.

2252
02:09:18,336 --> 02:09:19,837
Turn light
into dark.

2253
02:09:19,904 --> 02:09:21,539
Turn light
into dark.

2254
02:09:21,606 --> 02:09:23,074
[continues chanting
in native language]

2255
02:09:23,141 --> 02:09:25,410
[others chanting in English]
Turn light into dark.

2256
02:09:37,989 --> 02:09:40,357
Turn light into dark.
Mike, what's happening, man?

2257
02:09:40,424 --> 02:09:42,060
Keep chanting!

2258
02:09:42,126 --> 02:09:43,326
Turn light
into dark.

2259
02:09:43,393 --> 02:09:44,996
[Mike chanting
in native language]

2260
02:09:45,063 --> 02:09:46,430
[others chanting in English]

2261
02:09:46,496 --> 02:09:48,966
Turn light
into dark!

2262
02:09:49,033 --> 02:09:50,902
Turn light
into dark!

2263
02:09:50,968 --> 02:09:53,705
Turn light into dark!
Turn light into dark!

2264
02:09:53,771 --> 02:09:55,405
- [Mike] Keep chanting!
- Turn light into dark!

2265
02:09:55,472 --> 02:09:57,108
- [Mike] Keep chanting!
- Turn light into dark!

2266
02:09:57,175 --> 02:09:58,943
[Mike chanting
in native language]

2267
02:10:01,079 --> 02:10:03,014
[Eddie] Turn light into dark!
Turn light into dark!

2268
02:10:03,081 --> 02:10:04,115
Is it working?
Did we do it?

2269
02:10:04,182 --> 02:10:05,717
[box creaking]

2270
02:10:05,783 --> 02:10:07,785
[Mike grunting]

2271
02:10:07,852 --> 02:10:09,286
What is this?
Is this part of it?

2272
02:10:09,352 --> 02:10:10,822
Mike, is this supposed
to be happening?

2273
02:10:10,888 --> 02:10:12,123
- [Eddie] What? No, no, no.
- Keep chanting!

2274
02:10:12,190 --> 02:10:13,657
- What?
- Keep chanting!

2275
02:10:13,724 --> 02:10:15,026
Turn light
into dark!

2276
02:10:15,093 --> 02:10:16,560
- Turn light into dark.
- Come on!

2277
02:10:16,626 --> 02:10:19,229
[all] Turn light into dark.
Turn light into dark.

2278
02:10:19,296 --> 02:10:20,597
- [whimpering]
- Whoa!

2279
02:10:22,299 --> 02:10:23,500
[gasps]

2280
02:10:25,069 --> 02:10:26,369
Hey! Hey!

2281
02:10:26,436 --> 02:10:27,771
[all yelping]

2282
02:10:30,841 --> 02:10:31,976
Shit!

2283
02:10:34,678 --> 02:10:37,714
Move, move!
Whoa!

[groans]

2285
02:10:42,452 --> 02:10:43,887

2286
02:10:45,889 --> 02:10:47,824
Bev. Bev.

2287
02:10:48,959 --> 02:10:51,495
- [Beverly] Richie.
- [Richie] Are you okay?

2288
02:10:51,561 --> 02:10:53,029
- I can't hear shit.
- He's okay.

2289
02:10:53,097 --> 02:10:54,631
- [Bill] Are you all right?
- [Ben] Yeah. No, no, no.

2290
02:10:54,698 --> 02:10:56,234
- [Eddie] Wait, where's Mike?
- [Ben] Mike!

2291
02:10:56,299 --> 02:10:57,501
[men] Mike!

2292
02:10:57,567 --> 02:10:59,569
- I'm here!
- [Richie] Hey, guys.

2293
02:10:59,636 --> 02:11:01,638
Did we do it? Did we do it?
Yeah? Did we do it?

2294
02:11:01,705 --> 02:11:03,273
[Richie] We put the
tokens in the thing.

2295
02:11:03,340 --> 02:11:04,407
That's good, right?

2296
02:11:04,474 --> 02:11:06,244
[Eddie] We did it, right?

2297
02:11:06,309 --> 02:11:08,178
[all exclaim in fear]

2298
02:11:08,246 --> 02:11:09,679
Shit! Shit!

2299
02:11:09,746 --> 02:11:12,816
Oh, did it work, Mikey?
Did it work?

2300
02:11:12,883 --> 02:11:14,818
[Pennywise laughing]

2301
02:11:14,885 --> 02:11:18,421
Tell them why your silly
little ritual didn't work.

2302
02:11:19,656 --> 02:11:21,424
Tell them
it's all just a...

2303
02:11:21,491 --> 02:11:23,292
What's the word, Eds?

2304
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:24,628
Gazebo?

2305
02:11:25,896 --> 02:11:27,531
Mike, what's
he talking about?

2306
02:11:27,597 --> 02:11:28,765
[stuttering] Mikey?

2307
02:11:30,299 --> 02:11:35,071
Oh, Mikey, you never showed
them the fourth side, did you?

2308
02:11:35,138 --> 02:11:36,540
[Pennywise laughing]

2309
02:11:36,606 --> 02:11:38,041
Didn't want them to know

2310
02:11:38,108 --> 02:11:41,044
what actually happened to
the poor Shokopiwah?

2311
02:11:41,111 --> 02:11:43,379
- <i>Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.</i>
- [rumbling]

2312

[Shokopiwah screaming]

2313
02:11:51,888 --> 02:11:54,157
Fuck, Mikey.
You lied to us, again?

2314
02:11:54,224 --> 02:11:57,359
[stammering] No,
but they didn't believe!

2315
02:11:57,426 --> 02:11:58,662
They didn't believe
they could kill It!

2316
02:11:58,728 --> 02:12:00,063
That's why it didn't
work back then!

2317
02:12:00,130 --> 02:12:01,397
Are you fucking kidding
me, Mike?

2318
02:12:01,463 --> 02:12:02,999
- We hurt him.
- Fuck!

2319
02:12:03,066 --> 02:12:04,600
[Bill] Fuck you, Mikey.

2320
02:12:04,668 --> 02:12:07,704
I needed something,
anything, for us to remember.

2321
02:12:07,771 --> 02:12:09,272
Anything for us
to believe!

2322
02:12:09,338 --> 02:12:10,439
- God damn it!
- Fuck!

2323
02:12:10,506 --> 02:12:11,875

[Beverly] The Deadlights!

2326
02:12:20,583 --> 02:12:21,952
Don't look at them!

2327
02:12:22,018 --> 02:12:23,019
[groans]

2328
02:12:26,990 --> 02:12:28,591
For 27 years,

2329
02:12:29,525 --> 02:12:32,996
I dreamt of you.
[laughing]

2330
02:12:34,231 --> 02:12:36,532
I craved you.

2331
02:12:36,599 --> 02:12:39,202
Oh, I've
missed you! [laughs]

2332
02:12:39,269 --> 02:12:41,204
Mike! Move back!

2333
02:12:41,271 --> 02:12:45,374
Waiting for
this very moment.

2334
02:12:45,441 --> 02:12:47,943
Mikey!
You gotta move, Mikey!

2335
02:12:48,010 --> 02:12:49,745
- Sorry. I'm sorry, guys.
- [Eddie] Mike, come on, man!

2336
02:12:49,812 --> 02:12:51,181
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

2337
02:12:51,248 --> 02:12:53,649
Time to float!

[all gasp]

2339
02:12:56,253 --> 02:12:57,786
- Oh, shit!
- Sorry.

2340
02:12:59,955 --> 02:13:01,657
[Eddie] Mike, come on, get up!
Get him up!

2341
02:13:01,724 --> 02:13:03,559
- [Bill] Go, go!
- [Eddie] Run!

2342
02:13:03,626 --> 02:13:05,961
- Oh, shit!
- [Bill] Run! Go, go, go!

Go!

2346
02:13:36,158 --> 02:13:37,660
[Ben] Go, go, go!

2347
02:13:41,997 --> 02:13:42,998
Where'd he go?

2348
02:13:43,065 --> 02:13:44,199
Don't worry.
We'll find a way out.

2349
02:13:57,512 --> 02:13:58,981
[gasps]

2350
02:13:59,048 --> 02:14:00,049

Oh, shit.

[Richie] Holy shit!
Holy shit! Run!

[both gasp]

2358
02:14:18,901 --> 02:14:20,501
[Richie] Shit.
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

2359
02:14:26,674 --> 02:14:27,876
We're trapped.

2360
02:14:27,943 --> 02:14:29,711
- Where do we go?
- [rumbling]

2361
02:14:34,216 --> 02:14:36,118

- [Eddie] God damn it!
- [Richie] Uh...

2368
02:15:00,775 --> 02:15:02,977
All right.
"Not Scary At All." All right?

2369
02:15:03,044 --> 02:15:03,911
No, no, no.

2370
02:15:03,978 --> 02:15:05,646
- [stammering]
- Wait. Why?

2371
02:15:05,713 --> 02:15:07,483
They're flipped.
He's fucking with us.

2372
02:15:07,548 --> 02:15:09,717
- Are you sure? Positive?
- Trust me.

2373
02:15:09,784 --> 02:15:11,085
- Yes!
- Okay.

2374
02:15:15,690 --> 02:15:16,924

What the fuck?
You told me to trust you!

[screaming continues]

2380
02:15:34,443 --> 02:15:35,610
He's not
fucking with us.

2381
02:15:35,676 --> 02:15:36,811
Let's go to
"Not Scary At All."

2382
02:15:36,878 --> 02:15:38,179
Okay. [breathing heavily]

2383
02:15:44,085 --> 02:15:46,087
It's all right.
Let's go.

[panting]

2385
02:15:48,356 --> 02:15:49,991
Oh, shit.

2386
02:15:52,160 --> 02:15:53,961
No way am I falling
for this shit again.

2387
02:15:54,028 --> 02:15:56,464
Oh, yeah.
That thing's a fucking monster.

2388
02:15:56,531 --> 02:15:57,765
Richie, make it sit.

2389
02:15:57,832 --> 02:16:00,334
I know your moves,
you little bitch.

2390
02:16:02,970 --> 02:16:03,971
Rich?

2391
02:16:04,672 --> 02:16:06,007
It's gone, man.

2392
02:16:06,074 --> 02:16:07,475
- Yeah. Wait.
- Oh. Okay.

2393
02:16:07,542 --> 02:16:08,810
Okay.

2394
02:16:10,311 --> 02:16:11,312
Sit.

2395
02:16:12,480 --> 02:16:13,981
[Eddie] He did it.

2396
02:16:14,048 --> 02:16:15,416
Oh, that's cute.

2397
02:16:15,483 --> 02:16:17,218
- That's a good boy.
- That's actually super cute.

2398
02:16:17,285 --> 02:16:18,585
That's a good boy.

2399
02:16:18,652 --> 02:16:20,021
- Are you a good boy?
- [Richie] Good boy.

2400

2401
02:16:25,059 --> 02:16:26,327
Shit!

2402
02:16:26,394 --> 02:16:28,296
Yo, next time,
we just go with regular "Scary."

2403
02:16:28,362 --> 02:16:29,696
Next time?

2404
02:16:42,210 --> 02:16:45,179
[Georgie] I lost it,
Billy.

2405
02:16:46,947 --> 02:16:49,217
It just floated off.

2406
02:16:51,885 --> 02:16:54,654
[stuttering]
I'm not mad at you.

2407
02:16:56,056 --> 02:16:58,792
It's your fault what
happened, isn't it?

2408
02:17:01,128 --> 02:17:05,165
You weren't really that
sick that morning, were you?

2409
02:17:06,534 --> 02:17:07,767
No.

2410
02:17:09,669 --> 02:17:12,672
I just pretended

2411
02:17:12,739 --> 02:17:15,142
because I didn't want to
play with you.

2412
02:17:18,579 --> 02:17:20,414
I just didn't want to.

2413
02:17:21,616 --> 02:17:24,217
You lied and I died.

2414
02:17:24,985 --> 02:17:28,589
You lied and I died.

2415
02:17:28,655 --> 02:17:31,626
You lied and I died!

2416
02:17:31,691 --> 02:17:34,495
You lied and I died!

2417
02:17:34,562 --> 02:17:36,464
You lied and I died!

2418
02:17:36,531 --> 02:17:38,798
It happened because of
me, Georgie. Me.

2419
02:17:38,865 --> 02:17:40,367
No, no, no.
It was...

2420
02:17:48,576 --> 02:17:49,644
Lied and died!

2421
02:17:49,709 --> 02:17:51,612
- [yelps]
- Lied and died!

2422
02:17:51,678 --> 02:17:53,446
Lied and died!

2423

You lied and I died!

2424
02:17:55,650 --> 02:17:57,184

[yelps]

2429
02:18:27,948 --> 02:18:30,884
You in there, you little shit?
I can smell you.

2430
02:18:30,951 --> 02:18:33,386
[sniffs] You smell
just like Lois Lane.

2431
02:18:34,421 --> 02:18:35,589
Here's Johnny!

2432
02:18:35,655 --> 02:18:37,090

[continues screaming]

2439
02:19:15,794 --> 02:19:17,464
All that success,

2440
02:19:17,530 --> 02:19:18,931
all those sit-ups,

2441
02:19:18,998 --> 02:19:20,833
but deep down,
still just

2442
02:19:20,899 --> 02:19:23,836
a little fat, fat,
fatty loser...

2443
02:19:23,902 --> 02:19:25,204
[Pennywise laughing]

2444
02:19:25,271 --> 02:19:28,874

Beverly!

02:19:42,454 --> 02:19:43,889
Bevvie.

2451
02:19:43,956 --> 02:19:46,760
Just open up the door for
me, okay?

2452
02:19:46,825 --> 02:19:48,762
Beverly,
can you hear me?

2453
02:19:48,827 --> 02:19:50,429
[grunting]

2454
02:19:50,496 --> 02:19:52,798
Come to Daddy, now.

2455
02:19:52,865 --> 02:19:54,133
Bev, don't listen!

Are you still

"My heart
burns there, too."

2481
02:21:10,476 --> 02:21:11,943
It was you.

[Pennywise whooping]

2483
02:21:26,891 --> 02:21:28,494
We deserve to die.

2484
02:21:28,560 --> 02:21:30,027
No.

2485
02:21:30,094 --> 02:21:34,232
You were the best big brother
there ever [stuttering] was.

2486
02:21:34,298 --> 02:21:37,068
No! We killed
our little brother!

[Bill shushing]

2488
02:21:38,604 --> 02:21:40,371
He loved you.

2489
02:21:40,438 --> 02:21:42,073
And just because
you didn't want to play

2490
02:21:42,140 --> 02:21:43,408
on a rainy day,

2491
02:21:44,576 --> 02:21:46,244
just one time,

2492
02:21:48,614 --> 02:21:50,616

[labored breathing]

2564

Come out
and play, Losers!

2565
02:26:13,043 --> 02:26:14,510
He's hurt.
He's hurt really bad.

2566
02:26:14,576 --> 02:26:15,879
We gotta
get him out of here.

2567
02:26:15,945 --> 02:26:17,312
How are we supposed
to do that, Richie?

2568
02:26:21,183 --> 02:26:22,785
I almost killed It.

2569
02:26:24,087 --> 02:26:25,287
The leper.

2570
02:26:26,188 --> 02:26:28,357
My hands
around his throat.

2571
02:26:28,424 --> 02:26:30,626
And I could feel
him choking.

2572
02:26:31,995 --> 02:26:33,796
I made him small.

2573
02:26:39,135 --> 02:26:40,369
He seemed so weak.

2574
02:26:43,205 --> 02:26:44,807
He seemed so weak.

The Shokopiwah.

2576
02:26:48,444 --> 02:26:49,745
All living things
must abide by

2577
02:26:49,812 --> 02:26:51,313
the laws of the shape
they inhabit.

2578

[Ben] Guys!

2579
02:26:53,916 --> 02:26:55,984
There's a passageway.
Through here.

2580
02:26:57,286 --> 02:26:59,388
The tunnel.

2581
02:26:59,455 --> 02:27:01,390
Pennywise has to
make himself small

2582
02:27:01,457 --> 02:27:04,560
to get through the entrance
of the cavern, right?

2583
02:27:04,626 --> 02:27:05,961
Okay, so, if we can get back
there, we can

2584
02:27:06,028 --> 02:27:08,163
- force him down to size.
- Yeah.

2585
02:27:08,230 --> 02:27:11,433
We make him small.
Small enough so we can kill him.

2586
02:27:13,602 --> 02:27:16,972
I can smell
the stink of your fear!

[Pennywise laughing]

2588
02:27:18,507 --> 02:27:20,509
- Let's go! Go!
- [Ben] Come on! Come on!

2589
02:27:20,576 --> 02:27:22,377
It's tight. It's tight.
Be careful!

2590
02:27:36,592 --> 02:27:39,895
I need a little rest.
Oh, thanks. [groaning]

2591
02:27:41,063 --> 02:27:42,664
Hey.

2592
02:27:42,731 --> 02:27:43,766
Hey, Richie?

2593
02:27:43,832 --> 02:27:45,100
I gotta
tell you something.

2594
02:27:45,167 --> 02:27:46,769
What?
What's up, buddy?

2595
02:27:49,938 --> 02:27:50,939
I fucked your mother.

2596
02:27:53,407 --> 02:27:55,476
[laughing]

2597
02:27:55,543 --> 02:27:57,378
[Pennywise] Losers out!
[laughing]

2598
02:28:00,182 --> 02:28:01,382
[Bill] Go. Go!

Gotcha!

2603
02:28:14,963 --> 02:28:16,531
Whoa!

2604
02:28:16,597 --> 02:28:19,935
You filthy little children.

2605
02:28:20,002 --> 02:28:21,602
[laughs]

2606
02:28:21,669 --> 02:28:23,105
You got a plan B, man?
What the hell do we do now?

2607
02:28:23,172 --> 02:28:24,840
You die.
That's what you do.

2608
02:28:25,874 --> 02:28:27,042
[Ben] Mike?

2609
02:28:29,644 --> 02:28:31,445
There's more than one way
to make someone small.

2610
02:28:33,714 --> 02:28:34,615
Oh!

2611
02:28:34,682 --> 02:28:36,818
Make him
believe that he is.

2612
02:28:36,884 --> 02:28:38,753
- [stutters] What?
- Make him believe that he is.

2613
02:28:38,820 --> 02:28:42,356
Oh? Me?
Small? [laughs]

2614
02:28:43,391 --> 02:28:46,460
I am
the Eater of Worlds.

2615
02:28:46,527 --> 02:28:47,728
Not to us,
you're not.

2616
02:28:50,464 --> 02:28:51,866
You're just a clown.

You're a weak old woman.

The Eater of Worlds.

2620
02:29:04,111 --> 02:29:05,479
A headless boy!

2621
02:29:07,381 --> 02:29:08,883
Impostor!

You're a mimic!

A mimic!

- [Pennywise groaning]

2640
02:29:46,654 --> 02:29:48,990
- [Mike] Clown!
- Clown!

2641
02:29:49,056 --> 02:29:51,225
You're a fucking clown!

2642
02:29:51,292 --> 02:29:52,660
[Beverly] You're a clown!

2643
02:29:52,727 --> 02:29:54,862
- [Ben] A stupid mummy!
- Clown!

2644
02:29:56,230 --> 02:29:57,564
[Ben] Clown, motherfucker!

2645
02:29:57,632 --> 02:30:00,902
I am the Eater of Worlds!

2646
02:30:05,472 --> 02:30:07,474
[Ben] Clown!

2647
02:30:07,540 --> 02:30:10,144
- Clown!
- You're just a clown! Clown!

2648
02:30:10,211 --> 02:30:12,914
- I am the Eater of Worlds!
- [Ben and Bill] A clown!

2649
02:30:12,980 --> 02:30:14,447
- [Pennywise snarls]
- [Bill] Whoa!

2650
02:30:14,514 --> 02:30:16,616
[losers chanting]
A clown! A clown!

2651
02:30:17,218 --> 02:30:18,618
[screaming]

2652
02:30:18,685 --> 02:30:21,022
[Mike] No one's
afraid of you.

2653
02:30:21,088 --> 02:30:22,522
No one's scared of you.

2654
02:30:24,125 --> 02:30:26,426
[losers] Clown! Clown!

2655
02:30:27,427 --> 02:30:31,132
Clown. Clown. Clown.

2656
02:30:31,198 --> 02:30:32,799
[moaning]

2657
02:30:33,566 --> 02:30:35,735
- Clown.
- Clown.

2658
02:30:37,938 --> 02:30:39,873
A clown.

2659
02:30:39,940 --> 02:30:41,976
With a scared,
beating heart.

2660
02:30:42,043 --> 02:30:43,643
[whimpering]

2661
02:30:46,113 --> 02:30:47,747
[heart beating]

2662
02:30:52,253 --> 02:30:53,453
- [snarls]
- [yelps]

2663
02:30:57,490 --> 02:30:59,160
- [whining]
- [heart continues beating]

2664
02:31:04,464 --> 02:31:06,233
[screaming]

2665
02:31:29,556 --> 02:31:31,925
Look at you.

2666
02:31:33,326 --> 02:31:38,164
You're all grown up.

2667
02:31:40,400 --> 02:31:41,768
[laughing]

2668
02:31:45,305 --> 02:31:46,806
[wheezing]

2669
02:32:02,722 --> 02:32:04,656
[dying breath]

2670
02:32:41,528 --> 02:32:42,761
Eddie. Eddie.

2671
02:32:46,433 --> 02:32:48,600
Eddie.
We got Pennywise, man.

2672
02:32:50,702 --> 02:32:51,904
Eddie?

2673
02:33:02,382 --> 02:33:03,749
- [crying]
- [rumbling]

2674
02:33:04,716 --> 02:33:05,918
[Beverly] Richie.

2675
02:33:06,553 --> 02:33:07,786
He's gone.

2676
02:33:07,853 --> 02:33:09,289
He's all right.
No, he's just hurt.

2677
02:33:09,355 --> 02:33:11,690
We gotta get him outta here.
He's hurt. Ben.

2678
02:33:11,757 --> 02:33:13,092
Bill, he's okay.
We gotta get him outta here.

2679
02:33:13,158 --> 02:33:14,159
Bev.

2680
02:33:15,261 --> 02:33:16,728
Richie. [sniffles]

2681
02:33:19,466 --> 02:33:20,766
What?

2682
02:33:20,833 --> 02:33:22,768
Honey, he's dead.

2683
02:33:26,138 --> 02:33:28,374
We have to go. Come on.
Come on, Richie.

2684
02:33:28,441 --> 02:33:30,008
We gotta go.

2685
02:33:30,075 --> 02:33:31,777
- Come on, buddy. Come on.
- [rumbling intensifies]

2686
02:33:35,647 --> 02:33:36,882
[Ben] Let him go, man.
Let him go.

2687
02:33:36,949 --> 02:33:38,884
- [Bill] Got it.
- [all urging]

2688
02:33:38,951 --> 02:33:41,687
We can still help him, guys!
We can still help him!

2689
02:33:42,688 --> 02:33:43,856
[Ben] Go! Go! Get up!

2690
02:33:43,922 --> 02:33:46,125
Guys, we can
still help him!

2691
02:33:57,836 --> 02:33:59,905
[Richie] No! Eddie!

2692
02:34:00,339 --> 02:34:01,807
Eddie!

2693
02:34:06,111 --> 02:34:07,312
[Mike] Come on!
Let's go!

2694
02:34:12,351 --> 02:34:13,352
Come on! Let's go!

2695
02:34:16,288 --> 02:34:17,289
Move, move!

2696
02:34:23,661 --> 02:34:25,497
- Move, move!
- [Beverly] Run!

2697
02:34:25,564 --> 02:34:26,764
[Mike] Run!

2698
02:34:35,407 --> 02:34:36,841
[all yelping]

2699
02:34:40,745 --> 02:34:42,181
- Eddie!
- No, no, no!

2700
02:34:42,247 --> 02:34:43,248
Eddie!

2701
02:34:44,982 --> 02:34:47,352
We gotta get in there
and get him!

2702
02:34:47,419 --> 02:34:49,087
He's still in there!

2703
02:34:59,730 --> 02:35:01,098
Eddie!

2704
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:02,900
Eddie!

2705
02:36:02,560 --> 02:36:03,995
[Ben] You know what?

2706
02:36:04,061 --> 02:36:07,231
Eddie would have
hated this, guys.

2707
02:36:07,298 --> 02:36:10,401
What? Cleaning ourselves
in dirty water?

2708
02:36:10,468 --> 02:36:11,936
Yeah.

2709
02:36:12,003 --> 02:36:14,739
He'd be telling us we'd get
streptococcal something.

2710
02:36:14,805 --> 02:36:16,974
- [chuckles]
- Yeah.

2711
02:36:17,041 --> 02:36:18,476
But he would have
made us laugh, though.

2712
02:36:18,542 --> 02:36:20,077
Oh, yeah.

2713
02:36:20,144 --> 02:36:22,113
He'd be
looking out for us.

2714
02:36:23,848 --> 02:36:25,883
The way he always was.

2715
02:36:29,754 --> 02:36:31,555
Ain't that right, Richie?

2716
02:36:31,622 --> 02:36:32,822
[sobbing]

2717
02:36:34,125 --> 02:36:35,126
Hey.

2718
02:37:05,822 --> 02:37:07,023
Oh.

2719
02:37:07,758 --> 02:37:08,858
Thank you.

2720
02:37:08,925 --> 02:37:10,528
I don't have
my glasses on,

2721
02:37:10,594 --> 02:37:11,762
so I don't know who you people
are, but thank you.

2722
02:37:11,828 --> 02:37:13,096
[all laughing]

2723
02:37:14,831 --> 02:37:16,467
I legit
can't find my glasses.

2724
02:37:16,534 --> 02:37:17,768
You're serious?

2725
02:37:17,834 --> 02:37:19,169
- Glasses?
- Go that way.

2726
02:37:19,235 --> 02:37:20,837
Around here somewhere?

2727
02:37:26,644 --> 02:37:28,278
- I can't see them.
- Oh, I see them. Right there.

2728
02:37:28,345 --> 02:37:30,681
- Where?
- Look. Right...

2729
02:37:30,748 --> 02:37:32,148
If you just go, like...

2730
02:37:32,916 --> 02:37:34,351
Anybody have any luck?

2731
02:38:36,479 --> 02:38:37,480
Hey, guys.

2732
02:38:39,349 --> 02:38:40,417
Look.

2733
02:38:50,025 --> 02:38:51,561
Nothing lasts forever.

2734
02:39:11,980 --> 02:39:13,683
I can't go home
like this, guys.

2735
02:39:14,551 --> 02:39:15,718
My mom will kill me.

2736
02:39:15,785 --> 02:39:18,153
Dude, you've been gone
for 24 straight hours.

2737
02:39:18,220 --> 02:39:20,423
Your face is definitely
on a milk carton by now.

2738
02:39:20,490 --> 02:39:23,058
Also, that puke smells worse
than your mom's slippers.

2739
02:39:23,125 --> 02:39:24,326
[Young Beverly]
Oh, shut up, Richie.

2740
02:39:24,394 --> 02:39:25,829
Okay, first of all,
my mom's slippers

2741
02:39:25,895 --> 02:39:27,797
smell like potpourri, asshole.

2742
02:39:27,864 --> 02:39:29,331
No, they don't.

2743
02:39:29,399 --> 02:39:30,700
Yes, they do.
And, also, how would you know

2744
02:39:30,767 --> 02:39:32,367
what they smell like
in the first place?

2745
02:39:32,435 --> 02:39:33,503
[Young Mike] Can we
just keep it quiet,

2746
02:39:33,570 --> 02:39:35,237
please,
until we get home?

2747
02:39:35,304 --> 02:39:36,673
[Young Ben] "Potpourri" is
literally a French word

2748
02:39:36,739 --> 02:39:38,407
meaning "rotten pot."

2749
02:39:38,475 --> 02:39:39,374
[Young Richie] I knew there
was something rotten about it.

2750
02:39:53,088 --> 02:39:57,159
- [cell phone ringing]
- [Bill sighs]

2751
02:40:01,129 --> 02:40:03,398
- Mike?
- <i>Hey.</i> [chuckles]

2752
02:40:03,465 --> 02:40:05,667
I just thought
I'd check up on you.

2753
02:40:05,735 --> 02:40:07,035
You know,
just to see if you learned

2754
02:40:07,102 --> 02:40:08,403
how to finish
a book for once.

2755
02:40:08,470 --> 02:40:10,572
[chuckling]

2756
02:40:10,639 --> 02:40:12,441
I just finished
the first chapter.

2757
02:40:14,176 --> 02:40:17,713
And I think I actually know
where I'm going this time.

2758
02:40:18,447 --> 02:40:19,381
Good.

2759
02:40:19,448 --> 02:40:21,450
Say, can I ask
you a question?

2760
02:40:21,517 --> 02:40:22,684
<i>Sure.</i>

2761
02:40:24,219 --> 02:40:26,121
Why do you think
we're not forgetting?

2762
02:40:27,022 --> 02:40:28,925
You know, like last time?

2763
02:40:28,992 --> 02:40:30,726
Maybe 'cause It's dead.

2764
02:40:33,930 --> 02:40:35,297
Or maybe 'cause
we have more

2765
02:40:35,364 --> 02:40:37,833
we want to remember
than we want to forget.

2766
02:40:37,900 --> 02:40:39,434
I like that one.

2767
02:40:43,305 --> 02:40:44,373
You decide
what you want to do?

2768
02:40:44,439 --> 02:40:45,774
<i>About leaving Derry?</i>

2769
02:40:45,841 --> 02:40:48,210
Man, I've been in this cell
for 27 years.

2770
02:40:49,578 --> 02:40:51,146
Just seeing
what It wanted me to.

2771
02:40:54,917 --> 02:40:57,653
I think it's time I saw
the sky for a change.

2772
02:40:58,787 --> 02:41:00,956
<i>Go get it, Mikey.</i>

2773
02:41:01,023 --> 02:41:02,591
Oh, did you get the letter?

2774
02:41:02,658 --> 02:41:03,759
[stammers]

2775
02:41:03,825 --> 02:41:05,126
What letter?

2776
02:41:05,193 --> 02:41:07,963
You'll know
when you see it.

2777
02:41:08,030 --> 02:41:10,097
Well, hold on.
I just got the mail.

2778
02:41:10,164 --> 02:41:11,667
<i>We all got one.</i>

2779
02:41:14,269 --> 02:41:15,504
[Bill] Patricia Uris?

2780
02:41:16,471 --> 02:41:17,472
<i>Just...</i>

2781
02:41:18,640 --> 02:41:19,975
Just read it.

2782
02:41:20,042 --> 02:41:21,142
Okay.

2783
02:41:21,208 --> 02:41:23,445
<i>And call me.
Anytime.</i>

2784
02:41:24,211 --> 02:41:25,514
I will.

2785
02:41:25,581 --> 02:41:26,648
<i>And, Bill,</i>

2786
02:41:32,286 --> 02:41:34,556
I love you, man.

2787
02:41:34,623 --> 02:41:36,357
I love you, too.

2788
02:41:36,424 --> 02:41:38,794
<i>All right.
See you around.</i>

2789
02:42:05,954 --> 02:42:08,322
[Stanley] <i>Dear Losers,</i>

2790
02:42:08,389 --> 02:42:10,358
<i>I know what this must seem like,</i>

2791
02:42:10,424 --> 02:42:12,226
<i>but this isn't
a suicide note.</i>

2792
02:42:13,996 --> 02:42:17,698
<i>You're probably wondering
why I did what I did.</i>

2793
02:42:17,765 --> 02:42:20,802
<i>It's because I knew I was
too scared to go back.</i>

2794
02:42:20,869 --> 02:42:22,871
<i>And if
we weren't together,</i>

2795
02:42:22,938 --> 02:42:26,307
<i>if all of us alive
weren't united,</i>

2796
02:42:26,374 --> 02:42:28,609
<i>I knew we'd all die.</i>

2797
02:42:28,676 --> 02:42:33,048
<i>So, I made
the only logical move.</i>

2798
02:42:33,115 --> 02:42:34,815
<i>I took myself
off the board.</i>

2799
02:42:37,085 --> 02:42:38,686
<i>Did it work?</i>

2800
02:42:38,753 --> 02:42:40,287
[Stanley sighs]

2801
02:42:40,354 --> 02:42:42,390
<i>Well, if you're reading
this, you know the answer.</i>

2802
02:42:44,725 --> 02:42:46,694
<i>I lived
my whole life afraid.</i>

2803
02:42:48,562 --> 02:42:52,633
<i>Afraid of
what would come next.</i>

2804
02:42:52,700 --> 02:42:54,769
<i>Afraid of what
I might leave behind.</i>

2805
02:42:57,738 --> 02:42:58,773
<i>Don't.</i>

2806
02:43:00,808 --> 02:43:02,910
<i>Be who you want to be.</i>

2807
02:43:04,178 --> 02:43:05,746
<i>Be proud.</i>

2808
02:43:06,480 --> 02:43:08,115
You sleep okay?

2809
02:43:08,181 --> 02:43:09,517
Yeah.

2810
02:43:10,451 --> 02:43:12,486
I had a beautiful dream.

2811
02:43:12,553 --> 02:43:15,389
[Stanley] <i>And if you find
someone worth holding on to,</i>

2812
02:43:16,590 --> 02:43:19,460
<i>never ever let them go.</i>
