00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:01,973
[Seq] Bugs,
this is a direct violation

is happening here.

00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,983

You're thinking this Modal
is a loop? Or a treadmill?

I don't know.

Do you know this is a Modal?

108
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,477
What's a Modal?

109
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,854
It's a simulation

112
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,948
I know what I am.

113
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:12,283
Just like I know my job

114
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,451
is to hunt down
and destroy synthients.

115
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,786

116
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,500

119
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,842

don't know about this room?

120
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:32,970
How'd you find it?

121
00:08:33,053 --> 00:08:35,556
No one was ever
in the key shop,

122
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:36,849
so I started looking.

123
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,102

the more you found.

00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,730

125
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:50,863

00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,669
Holy shit.

128
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,506

00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,843
You mean Thomas Anderson's?

131
00:09:12,926 --> 00:09:14,887
I searched everywhere.
He doesn't exist.

132
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,222
He stopped being Thomas
a long time ago,

133
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,683
but maybe you know him
by his real name.

134
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,518
Neo.

135
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:24,229
You do.

136
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,899
Oh, okay.

137
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:28,859
Uh...

138
00:09:28,942 --> 00:09:31,570
I can't believe this,
after all these years.

139
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:35,324
You see, most people
think that Neo is dead.

140
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,077
But I know he's not.

141
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,788
Because I've seen him.

142
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,833
Where?

143
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,461
It's not something
I can explain easily, but...

144
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:55,094
<i>But the moment
he looked at me,</i>

145
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,804
I felt something...

146
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,850
unlock my mind.

147
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,479
Okay.

148
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,733
Something like that
happened to me.

149
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,323
<i>I saw this pattern...</i>

150
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:19,034
<i>and it was everywhere.</i>

151
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,038
We can't see it,
but we're all trapped inside

152
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,666
these strange,
repeating loops.

153
00:10:25,749 --> 00:10:29,002
Somehow I saw it
in the mirror.

154
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,839
Just a flicker,
but it was like you said.

155
00:10:37,344 --> 00:10:39,722
And suddenly I understood.

156
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,266
This is not the real world.

157
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:48,063
[agent] <i>For the first time,
I felt real purpose.</i>

158
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,691
I knew who I was

159
00:10:50,774 --> 00:10:52,693
and what I had to do.

160
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,778
Who are you?

161
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,823
What do you have to do?

162
00:11:00,784 --> 00:11:02,077
I am...

163
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,246
Morpheus.

164
00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:07,666
And I have to find Neo.

00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,760
Okay. Okay.

168
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:18,927
Oh, my God!

169
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,304
I have to get you out of here.

170
00:11:20,387 --> 00:11:22,806
I need to figure out
who built this Modal.

171
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,475
Okay, come with me.

172
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,685
You have to be ready to leave.
You have to be really ready.

173
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,061
And if you're not,

174
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,146
if you think that
this is where you belong...

175
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:34,067
You call this a choice?

176
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,652
Oh, honestly, when somebody
offered me these things,

177
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,237
I went off on binary
conceptions of the world

178
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,906
and said there was no way
I was swallowing

179
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,866
some symbolic reduction
of my life.

180
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:42,284

with the pills laughed

181
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:43,535
'cause I was
missing the point.

182
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,162
What point?

183
00:11:45,245 --> 00:11:48,165
The choice is an illusion.

184
00:11:48,248 --> 00:11:50,459
You already know
what you have to do.

185
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,300
Truth.

186
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,016
Okay.

187
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:07,309
There's an old building

188
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:08,977
with a skylight
and lots of stairs.

189
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,270
The Lafayette.

190
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,897
One of the four back doors
leads there.

191
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:13,857
[Morpheus] Oh.

192
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,442
- Don't fight it.
- Whoa, what's happening?

193
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,610
Keep breathing.

194
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:18,070
Extraction works
pretty much the same

195
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:20,072
for humans and programs.

196
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:23,909
Ouch.

197
00:12:23,992 --> 00:12:25,035
Ah.

198
00:12:26,453 --> 00:12:27,746
Okay.

199
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,708
- Hey.
- Hey.

200
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,585
I've never worn
different glasses before.

201
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:36,421
Yeah, looks good.
Which door?

202
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,298
- It's gotta be...
- Okay.

203
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,055
Agent White.

204
00:12:45,138 --> 00:12:46,348
Agent Smith?

205
00:12:46,431 --> 00:12:47,683
[laughs]

206
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:49,977
[Bugs grunts]

207
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,522
- [Bugs] Go!
- [grunts]

208
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,361
[men grunting]

209
00:13:00,737 --> 00:13:02,406
Seq! Can you hear me?

210
00:13:02,489 --> 00:13:03,740
Bugs! I thought I lost you.

211
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,075
Can you get us
to the window pane?

212
00:13:05,158 --> 00:13:07,119
Bugs! Bugs! He's an agent!

213
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,707
[Morpheus exclaims, grunts]

214
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,548
That window! Go hard!

215
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,225
[both screaming]

216
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,691
[screaming fades]

217
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,244
[keyboard clacking]

218
00:14:00,797 --> 00:14:02,716
[fast-paced music
playing on speakers]

219
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,221
- [computer buzzing]
- What the...

220
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,480
What the hell?

221
00:14:16,563 --> 00:14:18,815
[suspenseful music playing]

222
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,665
Something wrong?

223
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:37,501
Uh... Just a little crash.

224
00:14:37,584 --> 00:14:39,962
Morning, Bobbi. Morning, dude.

225
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:43,840
What a beautiful day
to be alive. Am I right?

226
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,926
- Problemo?
- He lost something.

227
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,553
Is this old <i>Matrix</i> code?

228
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:52,140
A little Modal experiment.

229
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,185
- For <i>Binary?</i>
- [cell phone chimes]

230
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:57,896
- I need a coffee.
- Coffee. Yes, stat!

231
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,106
I'm buying.

232
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,860
[man] I'm not trying to blow
smoke up your ass,

233
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:08,365
but the first time I played
the trilogy, I was shook.

234
00:15:08,448 --> 00:15:11,034
The paradox
between free will and destiny.

235
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,285
Are we all just algorithms

236
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,578
doing what we're
supposed to do

237
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,372
or can we escape
our programming?

238
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:19,376
Genius, inside the context
of the game, BT dubs.

239
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:21,545
Hey, did I tell you
it took over my life?

240
00:15:21,628 --> 00:15:24,381
Yeah. I failed
the seventh grade. [chuckles]

241
00:15:24,464 --> 00:15:26,633
Your game almost ruined me.

242
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,219
- So you've said.
- Yet here we are.

243
00:15:29,302 --> 00:15:32,139
- [cups clink]
- You tell me, Mr. Anderson,

244
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,265
is it free will

245
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,143
or destiny?

246
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,733
Oh, yeah.

247
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,735
There she is.

248
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,319
Total f-ing MILF.

249
00:15:47,195 --> 00:15:49,281
Daggers. Look, I'm sorry.

250
00:15:49,364 --> 00:15:51,658
I'm a geek.
I was raised by machines.

251
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,993
Maybe you should go.

252
00:15:53,076 --> 00:15:56,121
No, please.
I... I promise, best self.

253
00:15:56,204 --> 00:15:57,456
Best self.

254
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:02,627
Sure.

255
00:16:03,503 --> 00:16:04,921
You ever talk to her?

256
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,467
Tell you what.

257
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,929
For all you've done for me,
let me do this for you.

258
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,766
Jude, no. Stop.

259
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,559
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Thanks.

260
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:19,061
Hi. Um...

261
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,729
I know this is all
a bit extemporaneous.

262
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:22,439
I'm Jude Gallagher.

263
00:16:22,522 --> 00:16:25,108
I work for a game company
called Deus Machina.

264
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,443
Hi, Jude, I'm Tiffany.

265
00:16:26,526 --> 00:16:29,446
Tiffany. Wow.
Didn't see that coming.

266
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:31,448
- Mom loved Audrey Hepburn.
- Jude.

267
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:35,452
Oh, and this is my very
good friend, Thomas Anderson.

268
00:16:35,535 --> 00:16:37,454
He is a bona fide
famous person

269
00:16:37,537 --> 00:16:38,914
and considered by most to be

270
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:40,999
the greatest game designer
of our generation.

271
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,292
I'm sorry about this.

272
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,585
- Jude...
- [softly] Just talk to her.

273
00:16:43,668 --> 00:16:46,171
Hi, Thomas.
Everyone calls me "Tiff."

274
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,256
Hi.

275
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,556
Have we met?

276
00:16:58,016 --> 00:17:00,143
Uh, we both come here.

277
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,645
- Can I have your morning bun?
- [boy] Hey!

278
00:17:01,728 --> 00:17:03,146
Are you trying
to ball my mom or what?

279
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,523
- Brandon!
- [chuckles]

280
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,483
[boy 2] Can I have one bite?

281
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:09,569
Babe! What's going on?
We're gonna be late.

282
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,571
This is my husband, Chad.

283
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,448
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey.

284
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,160
Babe, we gotta get
Callie to practice.

285
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,329
Right. Sorry. [chuckles]

286
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,039
Come on, kids. Let's move out.

287
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,545
[soft music playing]

288
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,398
What?

289
00:17:46,481 --> 00:17:48,400
[keyboard clacking]

290
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,819
[ominous music playing]

291
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,199
Sorry. Uh, it's the boss.

292
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:05,208
"Billions of people
just living out their lives...

293
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,253
oblivious."

294
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:12,591
I always loved that line.

295
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,134
You wrote that one, yeah?

296
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,014
Every time I stand here,

297
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:22,350
I mean, O-M-G.

298
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,477
It's so perfect,
it's gotta be fake.

299
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,938
- Right?
- [chuckles softly]

300
00:18:28,815 --> 00:18:30,066
Yeah.

301
00:18:30,817 --> 00:18:32,068
Sure.

302
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,987
Have a seat.

303
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:36,907
[man sighs]

304
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,200
Smoke?

305
00:18:39,492 --> 00:18:40,535
I thought you quit.

306
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,788
I quit calling it a habit.

307
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,790
Now it's just
a guilty pleasure.

308
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:51,546
Oh. Maybe I can make this
easy for you.

309
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,673
I know <i>Binary</i> is over budget.

310
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,051
This is not about <i>Binary,</i> Tom.
It's bigger than that.

311
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:57,469
This is about our future,

312
00:18:57,552 --> 00:19:00,513
which is a sticky subject,
given our past.

313
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,806
What do you mean?

314
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,518
How's the therapy?

315
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:05,894
Good.

316
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,063
Any...

317
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,357
episodes?

318
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,235
No.

319
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,654
That's terrific.

320
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,867
Look, Tom, I know we've
always had our differences.

321
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,786
What did you say
about our first meeting?

322
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:26,122
We had all the chemistry
of an FBI interrogation.

323
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,249
[muffled yell]

324
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:28,750
[scoffs]

325
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,252
But look at this place.

326
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,671
We did this.

327
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,257
Together.

328
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,093
Yeah.

329
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:40,136
Now what?

330
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,807
Things have changed.
The market's tough.

331
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,184
I'm sure you can understand
why our beloved

332
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,644
parent company, Warner Bros.,

333
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:50,146
has decided to make
a sequel to the trilogy.

334
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,648
What?

335
00:19:51,731 --> 00:19:53,650
They informed me they're gonna
do it with or without us.

336
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:55,568
I thought
they couldn't do that.

337
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,695
[exhales]

338
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,154
Oh, they can.

339
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,572
And they made it clear

340
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,825
they'll kill our contract
if we don't cooperate.

341
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:03,618
Really?

342
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:07,580
I know you said the story
was over for you,

343
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,833
but that's the thing
about stories.

344
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:13,545
They never really end,
do they?

345
00:20:13,628 --> 00:20:16,172
We're still telling the same
stories we've always told,

346
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:20,552
just with different names,
different faces

347
00:20:22,178 --> 00:20:25,265
and I have to say
I'm kind of excited.

348
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,269
After all these years,

349
00:20:29,352 --> 00:20:32,355
to be going back
to where it all started.

350
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,774
Back to <i>The Matrix.</i>

351
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,610
I've spoken to Marketing...

352
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:41,865
- [sinister music playing]
- [distorted voice]

353
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,118
[in normal voice] Tom?

354
00:20:45,201 --> 00:20:46,745
Yeah.

355
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:47,871
Are you all right?

356
00:20:47,954 --> 00:20:49,372
[exhales nervously]

357
00:20:50,206 --> 00:20:51,333
Yeah.

358
00:20:56,254 --> 00:20:58,465
[analyst] What were you feeling
at that point?

359
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,345
What was I feeling?

360
00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:11,394
I felt either I'm having
a mental breakdown again

361
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:15,732
or I'm living inside
a computer-generated reality

362
00:21:15,815 --> 00:21:17,359
that has imprisoned me...

363
00:21:17,984 --> 00:21:19,152
again.

364
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,112
[laughs]

365
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,240
[chuckles softly]

366
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:31,331
Not much of a choice.

367
00:21:31,414 --> 00:21:32,624
No.

368
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:34,292
Maybe it's not
as binary as that.

369
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,670
Maybe there are other ways
to understand what happened.

370
00:21:38,254 --> 00:21:39,339
Yeah.

371
00:21:39,422 --> 00:21:41,591
Thomas, you are
a suicide survivor

372
00:21:41,674 --> 00:21:44,552
gifted with
a powerful imagination.

373
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,388
Those facts have combined

374
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,973
to create dangerous fictions
in your life.

375
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,600
Yesterday,
you walked into a meeting

376
00:21:50,683 --> 00:21:51,810
with your business partner

377
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,353
and he ambushed you,

378
00:21:53,436 --> 00:21:55,855
demanding you make a game
you said you would never make.

379
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:59,275
This attack effectively
took away your voice.

380
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,112
His violence triggered you
and your mind fought back.

381
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,072
You did to him
what he was doing to you.

382
00:22:05,573 --> 00:22:06,950
We've talked about the value

383
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:10,578
of adaptive anger
in healing trauma.

384
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:14,040
Far from suggesting a repeat
of your initial breakdown,

385
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,333
I believe this episode

386
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,210
demonstrates healthy
self-protection.

387
00:22:18,753 --> 00:22:20,964
And more importantly,
I remember how hard

388
00:22:21,047 --> 00:22:24,092
it was for you
to share something like this.

389
00:22:24,175 --> 00:22:26,886
Which tells me
just how far we've come.

390
00:22:28,304 --> 00:22:29,764
[chuckles softly]

391
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:34,269
Do you need a refill
on your prescription?

392
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,062
[sighs]

393
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,313
Yeah.

394
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,570
[pills rattle]

395
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,535

396
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,668
[grunts softly]

397
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,130
First of all, I know
I speak for everyone

398
00:23:02,213 --> 00:23:04,507
when I say that
I'm so, so excited

399
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,676
to be working on a game
that was such a...

400
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:08,845
well, game changer.

401
00:23:08,928 --> 00:23:10,513
Now, the packet
in front of you

402
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:13,391
has our focus group research.

403
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,934
Inside, you'll find
the breakdown

404
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,854
including keyword association
with the brand.

405
00:23:17,937 --> 00:23:21,024
The top two being
"originality" and "fresh,"

406
00:23:21,107 --> 00:23:23,151
which I think are great things
to keep in mind

407
00:23:23,234 --> 00:23:25,445
as you begin
working on <i>Matrix 4.</i>

408
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,573
And who knows how many more?

409
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,493
[alarm buzzing, stops]

410
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,458
[singing indistinctly]

411
00:23:44,088 --> 00:23:47,509
What made <i>Matrix</i> different?
It effed with your head.

412
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,885
On point.

413
00:23:48,968 --> 00:23:50,970
People want us
up in their grey space,

414
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:54,098
switching their synaptic
"WTF" light on.

415

[man laughing]

417
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:06,569
What made <i>Matrix</i> different?
It effed with your head.

418
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,488
People want us
up in their grey space,

419

switching their synaptic

420
00:24:09,989 --> 00:24:12,617
"What the hell
is going on here?" light on.

00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,627
[shower running]

423
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:26,923
I didn't love the first one,
like some of you.

424
00:24:27,006 --> 00:24:29,425
And, frankly,
I've got zero tolerance

425
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,928
for anything that requires
a syllabus and a highlighter.

426
00:24:32,011 --> 00:24:33,888
I like my games big,
loud and dumb.

427
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,932
We need guns! Lots of guns.

428
00:24:36,015 --> 00:24:38,601
<i>Matrix</i> means mayhem.

429
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:41,312
[grunting]

430
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,441
Mindless action
is not on-brand.

431
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,943
[man] She's right.

432
00:24:47,026 --> 00:24:50,071
<i>Matrix</i> is mind-porn.
Philosophy in shiny...

433
00:24:50,154 --> 00:24:51,823
- tight PVC.
- Yeah.

434
00:24:51,906 --> 00:24:53,783
Ideas are the new "sexy."

["White Rabbit"

436
00:25:07,922 --> 00:25:09,632
Obviously
<i>The Matrix</i> is about...

437
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,968
- ...trans-politics.
- Crypto-fascism.

438
00:25:12,051 --> 00:25:12,969
It's a metaphor...

439
00:25:13,052 --> 00:25:14,721
...of capitalist exploitation.

440
00:25:27,191 --> 00:25:31,571
This cannot be another reboot,
retread, regurgitated...

441
00:25:31,654 --> 00:25:33,740
Why not? Reboots sell.

442
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,870
We are so far down the wrong
rabbit hole, here, people.

443
00:25:38,953 --> 00:25:42,790
You say <i>Matrix</i> to anyone...
You say <i>Matrix...</i>

444
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,835
[echoing] Matrix...
Matrix... Matrix...

445
00:25:45,918 --> 00:25:47,754
...this is what they see.

Allow me to sum up our goal
in a single word.

449
00:25:56,804 --> 00:25:58,973
Bullet time! Bullet time!

450
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,683
That's two words.

451
00:26:04,687 --> 00:26:07,857
We need
a new "bullet time." [echoing]

452
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,360
[laughs maniacally]

453
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:14,364
We need to revolutionize
gaming again.

454
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:18,242
Revolutionize gaming
again! [echoing]

You know what, Skroce?
I'm going wild.

459
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,984
I'll have a cortado today.

460

Fly that freak flag.

461
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,447
Mind if I get that?

462
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,573
Oh, hi.

463
00:26:58,574 --> 00:27:00,576
Hi.

464
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,162
[Tiffany] I remember
wanting a family,

465
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,539
but was that because

466
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:07,291
that's what women
are supposed to want?

467
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,085
How do you know
if you want something yourself

468
00:27:09,168 --> 00:27:12,296
or if your upbringing
programmed you to want it?

469
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,381
Mmm.

470
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,384
I pay my analyst
a lot of money

471
00:27:16,467 --> 00:27:19,053
to answer
such questions for me.

472
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,346
Smart.

473
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,639
I should get more therapy

474
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,142
but honestly,
I'm too goddamn tired.

475
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,977
Kids are exhausting, you know?

476
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,814
No. Never had kids.

477
00:27:29,897 --> 00:27:32,650
Oh, right, I knew that.

478
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,194
- Sorry. I googled you.
- [chuckles]

479
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,741
So, what's it like being
a world-famous game designer?

480
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,368
- Must be amazing.
- Uh...

481
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,953
A lot of hours.

482
00:27:44,036 --> 00:27:46,080
Sometimes it is amazing.

483
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,665
Most times...

484
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,168
I don't know.

485
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,754
But you made <i>The Matrix.</i>
Even I've heard of that.

486
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:56,632
Yeah. We kept
some kids entertained.

487
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,843
- So, worth it?
- [chuckles]

488
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,769
Can I ask something
about your game?

489
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,103
Sure.

490
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,439
Did you base your
main character on yourself?

491
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,571
There is a lot of me in him.

492
00:28:18,654 --> 00:28:20,990
[indistinct shouting]

493
00:28:21,073 --> 00:28:24,243
Maybe a little too much.

494
00:28:26,245 --> 00:28:27,997
Can I ask you something else?

495
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,290
Please.

496
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,294
There's a woman in your game.

497
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:35,505
Trinity.

498
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,092
Which is a weird
coincidence also, right?

499
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:42,762
God, yeah.

500
00:28:44,138 --> 00:28:45,389
I like her.

501
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,893
- I like Trinity.
- Ah.

502
00:28:48,976 --> 00:28:50,228
And I dig her Ducati.

503
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:53,314
Another coincidence.
I love motorcycles.

[engine revs]

actually build them.

506

Really?

507
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,991
You have your analyst,
I have my bikes.

508
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:08,704
So, I was looking at images
from your game. At Trinity.

509
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:11,999
Well, I showed Chad a scene,

510
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,126
and I was like,
"So, what do you think?"

511
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,713
He didn't get it until I said,

512
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:19,799
"Don't you think
she looks like me?"

513
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:23,344
You know what he did?

514
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:25,930
He laughed.

515
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:33,521
And I laughed too,
like it was a joke.

516
00:29:33,604 --> 00:29:35,147
How could it not be, right?

517
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,985
Made me so angry.

518
00:29:40,486 --> 00:29:42,822
I hated myself for laughing.

519
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:47,577
I wanted to kick him so hard.

520
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,162
Not too hard.

521
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:53,457
Maybe just hard enough
to break his jaw off.

522
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,709
[chuckles]

523
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,504
And right now,
you're probably regretting

524
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,089
sitting down with me.

525
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:06,137
This is the best thing
I've done in a long time.

00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,472

Hi, this is Tiff.

530
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,107
Oh, God, no.

532
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,153
I'll be right there.

stuck a Lego up his nose.

534
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,241
Oh.

535
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:29,702
I gotta go.

536
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:34,498

00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,658
Please move to the exits.
Building's being evacuated.

547
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,076
[cell phone buzzes]

548
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:26,550
[suspenseful music playing]

549
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,597
[security guard] Sir, this way.

550
00:31:37,436 --> 00:31:38,604
Jude?

551
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,190
Jude!

552
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,615
At last.

553
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,702
[chuckles] Ah.

554
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,245
I wasn't too sure
about the callback,

555
00:31:54,328 --> 00:31:56,330
but, you know,
it was hard to resist.

556
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,540
What?

557
00:31:57,623 --> 00:31:59,041
Morpheus Uno.
Reveal at the window.

558
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,585
Lightning,
thunder and theater.

559
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,546
At last.

560
00:32:03,629 --> 00:32:06,048
All these years later,
here's me,

561
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,384
strolling out
of a toilet stall.

562
00:32:08,467 --> 00:32:09,593
Tragedy or farce?

563
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,303
I know you.

564
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,389
Not every day
you meet your maker.

565
00:32:13,472 --> 00:32:14,640
This can't be happening.

566
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,392
Oh, most definitely is.

567
00:32:16,475 --> 00:32:18,936
You can't be
a character I coded.

568
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,063
100% natural.

569
00:32:26,652 --> 00:32:27,903
[gasps softly]

570
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:29,739
How?

571
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:31,991
All the explanation you need.

572
00:32:35,202 --> 00:32:36,829
Oh.

573
00:32:36,912 --> 00:32:38,080
No.

574
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,915
No, no, no.

575
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,792
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What do you mean, "no"?

576
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:44,503
You wanted this, you did this.
This was your idea.

577
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:48,924
[hesitating]
It was a test. An experiment.

578
00:32:50,217 --> 00:32:51,427
An experiment?

579
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,930
You put me
in a tiny-ass Modal,

580
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,390
left me to bang my head till

581
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,726
I nearly lost my shit
searching for you

582
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:00,311
as an experiment.

583
00:33:00,394 --> 00:33:02,396
- The exit's breaking down.
- He hasn't taken the pill.

584
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,814
What? There's no time.

585
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,941
I know, I know.
He's having a moment.

586
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,486
Does he know how hard it was
to hack that mirror?

587
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,738
[tense music playing]

588
00:33:10,821 --> 00:33:12,448
Still open.

589
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:15,951
This... This can't be real.

590
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,870
[SWAT officer] Target acquired.
We got him.

591
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,377
[grunting]

592
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:26,796
This isn't happening.

593
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:29,340
It's in my mind.
It's in my mind.

594
00:33:29,423 --> 00:33:30,633
[SWAT officer 2] Hey, you!
Stop! Hold it!

595
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,845
[all screaming]

596
00:33:38,557 --> 00:33:40,309
[groaning]

597
00:33:46,732 --> 00:33:48,275
This can't be happening.

598
00:33:50,152 --> 00:33:51,320
- [gunshots]
- [gasps]

599
00:33:51,403 --> 00:33:53,155
[SWAT officer 3]
Freeze! Don't move!

600
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:56,826
[gun firing]

601
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,249
Neo!

602
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:11,465
[tense music playing]

603
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,761
[gun firing]

604
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,557
Oh, my God!

605
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,394
[distorted gunfire]

606
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,777
[men groaning]

607
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:34,905
[grunting]

608
00:34:40,911 --> 00:34:42,204
[tense music continues]

609
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,384
Neo!

610
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,181
[tense music builds]

611
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,474
[shouts] Mr. Anderson!

612
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,560
No!

613
00:35:04,643 --> 00:35:05,686
It can't be.

614
00:35:14,486 --> 00:35:16,322
I've missed you.

615
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,079
[cat meows]

616
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,709
[bell tinkling]

617
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,255
It's in my mind.

618
00:35:34,381 --> 00:35:35,758
It's in my mind.

619
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,849
[cup clinking]

620
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,434
[analyst]
Can you hear me, Thomas?

621
00:35:46,685 --> 00:35:49,480
Follow my voice.

622
00:35:49,563 --> 00:35:53,275
Feel the tips of your fingers.
What are they touching?

623
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,735
[bell tinkling]

624
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,695
The bell.

625
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,616
Do you hear the bell?

626
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:07,081
Do you remember what happened?
How you got here?

627
00:36:08,707 --> 00:36:10,000
You must have walked.

628
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,293
I heard Deja Vu outside,

629
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,628
opened my door,
and there you were.

630
00:36:16,423 --> 00:36:17,883
[Thomas Anderson exhales]

631
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:20,803
You feel like
you can talk about it?

632
00:36:20,886 --> 00:36:22,137
When we started
working together,

633
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,973
you had lost your capacity

634
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:26,600
to discern reality
from fiction.

635
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,853
You came to me after
trying to jump off a building.

636
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:32,231
You said you wanted
to fly away.

637
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:37,194
[indistinct chatter]

638
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,866
[people shouting]

639
00:36:45,577 --> 00:36:48,330
We have made
a lot of progress since then,

640
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,749
but you seem particularly
triggered right now.

641
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,293
Can you tell me
how it started?

642
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,005
He texted me.

643
00:36:57,172 --> 00:36:58,507
Who?

644
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,050
Morpheus.

645
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,218
Ah.

646
00:37:02,928 --> 00:37:04,305
So, he's back.

647
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,557
It wasn't actually him.

648
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:11,020
It was a program
I coded for a Modal.

649
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,272
And this "Modal," Morpheus,

650
00:37:13,355 --> 00:37:15,357
came to help you escape

651
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:19,069
from a virtual reality
called <i>The Matrix.</i>

652
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:31,165
Am I crazy?

653
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:33,709
We don't use that word
in here.

654
00:37:33,792 --> 00:37:36,712
What word should I use?

655
00:37:36,795 --> 00:37:40,132
What word explains
what is happening to me?

656
00:37:40,215 --> 00:37:41,884
Can I see the texts?

657
00:37:42,801 --> 00:37:44,261
[exhales]

658
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,888
They were erased.

659
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:54,480
If we got in my car
and drove to your office,

660
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,523
what do you think
we'd find there?

661
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,649
Nothing.

662
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,446
Because there was no attack.

663
00:38:03,655 --> 00:38:05,240
No one was killed.

664
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,285
No one texted.

665
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,412
My mind made it all up.

666
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,500
Is that what
I'm supposed to say?

667
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,085
Is that what you believe?

668
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,754
It felt real.

669
00:38:18,837 --> 00:38:20,589
Of course.

670
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:23,592
It was your great ambition
to make a game

671
00:38:23,675 --> 00:38:26,053
that was indistinguishable
from reality.

672
00:38:26,136 --> 00:38:27,596
To achieve this goal,

673
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:30,140
you converted elements
of your life into narrative.

674
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,476
Your sublimated anger
toward your business partner

675
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:34,770
cast him as your nemesis.

676
00:38:34,853 --> 00:38:36,480
A married woman named Tiffany

677
00:38:36,563 --> 00:38:39,900
became the "Trinity"
of a doomed romance.

678
00:38:39,983 --> 00:38:44,154
Even your dislike of my cat
made it into your <i>Matrix.</i>

679
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,031
There's nothing wrong
with that.

680
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,574
It's what artists do.

681
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:51,036
But it becomes a problem
when fantasies

682
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,455
endanger us or other people.

683
00:38:55,707 --> 00:38:58,085
We don't want anyone
to get hurt,

684
00:38:58,168 --> 00:38:59,545
do we, Thomas?

685
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,763
Hi, Thomas.
Everyone calls me "Tiff."

686
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,266
- Who are you?
- My name is Trinity.

you're in love.</i>

You just know it,

Balls to bones.

690
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,024
[Trinity whispers]
<i>You feel this?</i>

691
00:39:22,734 --> 00:39:24,445
I'm never letting go.

[Morpheus] <i>You have
to let it all go, Neo.</i>

695
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:36,623
Free your mind.

[pigeon cooing]

699
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,852
Huh.

700
00:39:56,935 --> 00:39:58,937
Looks easy enough.

702
00:40:05,777 --> 00:40:08,405
"Free my mind." Shit.

[suspenseful music playing]

704
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,621
Okay.

705
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:17,122
Free my mind.

[grunts]

707
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:34,890
I fly...

708
00:40:35,807 --> 00:40:37,726
or I fall.

Who the hell are you?

713
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:49,738
You won't remember me,

714
00:40:49,821 --> 00:40:53,075
but a long time ago,
you changed my life

715
00:40:53,158 --> 00:40:55,536
when you leapt off
another roof.

716
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,539
<i>Back then, I was just like
any other coppertop,</i>

00:41:00,415 --> 00:41:04,545
until I looked up
and I saw you.

the real you,

00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,552
just a second before...

722
00:41:13,011 --> 00:41:14,096
you leapt.

[people shouting]

724
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:20,644
And you never fell.

Are you the one
that hacked my Modal?

726
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:29,695
Yeah.

00:41:31,196 --> 00:41:32,739
That'll be Jude.

He's not your friend.

730
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,701
He's a handle,
a program used to control you.

731
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:36,827
He's on his way here,

732
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,745
and he's bringing
Agents with him.

of a sexy question, dude.</i>

[Bugs] They don't look like
typical Agents.

739
00:41:55,887 --> 00:41:57,306
They use bots now,
skinned as normal people,

740
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:58,515
which means they're everywhere

741
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,851
and you never know
who to trust.

742
00:42:00,934 --> 00:42:02,686
Why should I trust you?

743
00:42:04,771 --> 00:42:07,858
Because if they open
that door, we lose our hack.

744
00:42:07,941 --> 00:42:09,651
I will be caught and killed

745
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:10,944
and you will be put right back

746

they designed for you,

747
00:42:12,362 --> 00:42:13,488

the last time

00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:14,740

your way out.

I know why you left
your Modal open.

750
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:21,038
You needed someone else
to free Morpheus.

751
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:23,165
And it's because of him that
we were able to get to you.

752
00:42:23,248 --> 00:42:25,125
I know these things
the same way

753
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:27,961
that I knew one day
I would find you.

754
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,672
And that when I did,
you would be ready for this.

If you want the truth, Neo,

756
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,890
you're going
to have to follow me.

00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:42,434

does that mean

then we died.

Obviously not.

794
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,238
Why the Machines
kept you alive

795

and why they went
to such lengths to hide you

796
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:05,118

we don't have answers to.

798
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:11,166
I've been at a company making

Doesn't seem like they were
trying to hide anything.

We've been tracking

We screened every
Thomas Anderson we found.

What we didn't understand

803
00:45:20,091 --> 00:45:22,594
was that they could
alter your DSI.

804
00:45:22,677 --> 00:45:24,429
Pods generate
your digital self-image

to alter your DSI loop.

Why did it take 20 years

It took a lot longer
than that.

It's been over 60 years

There's so much we don't know.

817
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,014
Like why you've barely aged,

818
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,308
or how many times
they've altered your DSI.

819

[Morpheus] But based on
what we do know,

820
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,144
it appears no one found you

821
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:15,063
because you didn't
want to be found.

822
00:46:15,146 --> 00:46:17,899
- That's not true.
- [Morpheus] Maybe it isn't.

Maybe there's no foundation

to the rumors
that you disappeared,

from the beginning.

All I'm saying is
this is the moment

where you belong,

As to my role in all this,
my best guess

1094
01:04:48,717 --> 01:04:50,552
Cybebe and Octacles
risked their lives

1095
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:51,804
to help get you out.

1096
01:04:53,263 --> 01:04:54,264
Thank you.

1097
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:56,850
But why?

1098
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:59,478
[Morpheus]
Not all seek to control.

1099
01:04:59,561 --> 01:05:01,563
Just as not all
wish to be free.

1100
01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:04,608
What is that?

1101
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:06,986
An exomorphic-particle codex.
It's pretty new.

1102
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:09,196
It gives programs
access to this world.

1103
01:05:09,279 --> 01:05:10,489
Within limits.

1104
01:05:10,572 --> 01:05:13,575
Limits are the domain
of the limited.

1105
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:15,202
Morpheus.

1106
01:05:15,285 --> 01:05:16,328
Thank you.

1107
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:17,830
It was my honor.

1108
01:05:19,623 --> 01:05:20,874
[chuckles] Wow.

1109
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:22,126
- [crew chuckles]
- How does it work?

1110
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:23,711
Paramagnetic oscillation.

1111
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:24,962
If you want,

1112
01:05:25,045 --> 01:05:26,296
I can download
the codex manual for you.

1113
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,799
- Sure.
- Downloading used to be fun.

1114
01:05:28,882 --> 01:05:31,260
Now it's all manuals
and diagnostics.

1115
01:05:31,343 --> 01:05:33,053
Can I ask them something?

1116
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:39,226
When you unplugged me,
there was another pod?

1117
01:05:39,309 --> 01:05:40,477
[warbling softly]

1118
01:05:40,561 --> 01:05:43,439
Yes. We've analyzed the data.

1119
01:05:44,648 --> 01:05:45,983
It could be Trinity.

1120
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:48,402
It's her.

1121
01:05:48,485 --> 01:05:51,572
I figured we were going
to have this conversation.

1122
01:05:51,655 --> 01:05:54,575
Look, you were not
a typical flush-and-grab.

1123
01:05:54,658 --> 01:05:56,326
You were in this weird tower
that Cybebe

1124
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:58,495
had never accessed,
and she's now exiled.

1125
01:05:58,579 --> 01:06:00,956
We burned
our one shot for you.

1126
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,083
Even if it were Trinity
and she wanted to be free,

1127
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:05,210
we have no idea how to do it.

1128
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:06,295
Yet.

1129
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:11,592
Nobody believed
we'd ever find him,

1130
01:06:11,675 --> 01:06:12,718
but we did.

1131
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:17,056
Okay.

1132
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:20,267
We don't know
how to get her out... yet.

1133
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:24,980
Captain, we're approaching
security clearance.

1134
01:06:26,273 --> 01:06:27,441
We're here.

1135
01:06:27,524 --> 01:06:28,567
Zion?

1136
01:06:36,658 --> 01:06:38,118
Have a seat.

1137
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:40,954
This is Hanno.
Best pilot in our fleet.

1138
01:06:41,038 --> 01:06:41,997
Quite a few synthients

1139
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:43,540
deserve that title before me.

1140
01:06:43,624 --> 01:06:44,792
[Control on radio]
Mnemosyne, <i>you are cleared</i>

1141
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:46,251
<i>for landing. Welcome home.</i>

1142
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,003
[Hanno] Thank you, Control.

1143
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:49,671
Um, we're about to crash.

1144
01:06:50,672 --> 01:06:52,591
[dramatic music playing]

1145
01:06:55,385 --> 01:06:56,512
[chuckles]

1146
01:06:56,595 --> 01:06:57,846
General realized we were

1147
01:06:57,930 --> 01:06:59,973
never going to beat
the Sentinels, so...

1148
01:07:00,057 --> 01:07:02,184
we just got better
at hiding from them.

1149
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:08,357
Welcome to Io.

1150
01:07:09,983 --> 01:07:11,401
Io.

1151
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:13,278
[sweeping music playing]

1152
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:20,577
Wow. That looks real.

1153
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:22,663
Bio-sky.

1154
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,585
Works kind of like
grow lights.

1155
01:07:28,669 --> 01:07:30,337
It's way more complex
than that.

1156
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:32,881
It pulls water from the crust,
hydronating the air.

1157
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:36,301
It balances the ECO
and our SRI cycles.

1158
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:38,720
Plus... [sighs]

1159
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:41,348
it is pretty to look at.

1160
01:07:41,431 --> 01:07:43,225
As opposed to that.

1161
01:07:44,518 --> 01:07:47,104
I guess the general sent us
a welcome party.

1162
01:08:05,372 --> 01:08:06,790
God damn.

1163
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:09,084
It is you.

1164
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,128
Niobe?

1165
01:08:12,963 --> 01:08:16,550
A few more wrinkles
and a few less teeth,

1166
01:08:16,633 --> 01:08:20,304
but wise enough to know
I don't know anything.

1167
01:08:20,387 --> 01:08:23,056
I sure as shit
never saw this coming.

1168
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:25,058
Neither did I.

1169
01:08:25,142 --> 01:08:26,476
I told you he was alive.

1170
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,520
Captain, you and your crew
have been grounded.

1171
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:30,230
General,
if you'd just let me explain.

1172
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:32,941
The protocols are put in place
for everyone's protection.

1173
01:08:33,025 --> 01:08:34,902
I'm sorry.
I saw an opportunity

1174
01:08:34,985 --> 01:08:36,445
and I was afraid
we'd lose him.

1175
01:08:36,528 --> 01:08:39,198
But, General, people have been
waiting for so long.

1176
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:42,117
We found The One.

1177
01:08:43,952 --> 01:08:45,662
I don't believe in The One.

1178
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:49,041
I never did.

1179
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:50,792
No?

1180
01:08:51,877 --> 01:08:53,420
Me neither.

1181
01:08:53,503 --> 01:08:55,881
But there was a time

1182
01:08:55,964 --> 01:08:58,634
when you trusted me
with your ship,

1183
01:08:58,717 --> 01:09:00,510
against the Council's orders.

1184
01:09:00,594 --> 01:09:02,679
The world was different then.

1185
01:09:04,514 --> 01:09:06,141
We were different.

1186
01:09:08,185 --> 01:09:09,603
Report to the docks.

1187
01:09:09,686 --> 01:09:11,396
Scrub down the <i>Mnemosyne.</i>

1188
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,774
Transfer your access codes.

1189
01:09:13,857 --> 01:09:15,275
You are done, Captain.

1190
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:16,401
[gasps softly]

1191
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:26,787
We need to talk.

1192
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,670
[Niobe] When word first came

1193
01:09:34,753 --> 01:09:37,005
that it actually
might be you...

1194
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:44,554
I didn't know how I would feel
in this moment.

1195
01:09:52,437 --> 01:09:54,398
It is nice to see you.

1196
01:09:54,481 --> 01:09:57,192
- It's good to see you too.
- [glasses clink]

1197
01:10:03,073 --> 01:10:05,826
A long way
from Dozer's paint stripper.

1198
01:10:05,909 --> 01:10:08,870
[chuckles] Yes.

1199
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:10,706
A lot has changed.

1200
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:14,167
Except maybe you.

1201
01:10:16,962 --> 01:10:18,505
You remember this?

1202
01:10:25,595 --> 01:10:28,348
It's so easy to forget
how much noise

1203
01:10:28,432 --> 01:10:30,350
the Matrix pumps
into your head

1204
01:10:30,434 --> 01:10:32,227
until you unplug.

1205
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:33,603
[Neo sighs]

1206
01:10:33,687 --> 01:10:35,063
Yeah.

1207
01:10:35,147 --> 01:10:38,066
Something else
makes the same kind of noise.

1208
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:40,360
Takes over every damn thing,

1209
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:42,154
just like the Matrix.

1210
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:44,823
War.

1211
01:10:46,533 --> 01:10:49,161
I stood at the barricade
of the Temple.

1212
01:10:50,954 --> 01:10:53,248
Staring
at the army of Sentinels,

1213
01:10:54,374 --> 01:10:57,002
waiting for them
to kill every one of us.

1214
01:10:58,462 --> 01:11:01,548
But then, they left.

1215
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:05,218
They said you saved us.

1216
01:11:05,302 --> 01:11:06,470
I didn't believe it.

1217
01:11:06,553 --> 01:11:09,890
Every night I would dream
of attack sirens.

1218
01:11:10,557 --> 01:11:11,808
But then,

1219
01:11:14,394 --> 01:11:16,605
I would wake up to this...

1220
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:22,069
silence.

1221
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:27,074
I'm ashamed of it now.

1222
01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:31,161
My pessimism of how long
it took me to believe

1223
01:11:31,244 --> 01:11:34,498
a world without war
was possible.

1224
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:37,918
You gave me that.

1225
01:11:38,001 --> 01:11:40,879
You gave that gift to us all.

1226
01:11:40,962 --> 01:11:44,633
And it is the gift
that continues to bear fruit.

1227
01:11:47,344 --> 01:11:49,096
Come help me get up.

1228
01:11:49,179 --> 01:11:50,931
Let's take a walk.

1229
01:11:51,014 --> 01:11:54,226
[mysterious music playing]

[elevator door opens]

1231
01:12:15,038 --> 01:12:17,040
Oh! Beautiful.

1232
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:21,086
This is Freya, head of botany.

1233
01:12:21,169 --> 01:12:24,464
And this is Quillion,
our lead digitologist.

1234
01:12:24,548 --> 01:12:28,552
I presume our guest
needs no introduction.

1235
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:31,304
Nothing travels
faster than light,

1236
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:32,639
except gossip.

1237
01:12:32,722 --> 01:12:33,765
[Freya chuckles]

1238
01:12:35,016 --> 01:12:36,435
Welcome to the Garden, Neo.

1239
01:12:38,478 --> 01:12:39,646
A strawberry?

1240
01:12:39,729 --> 01:12:41,440
Using digital code
from the Matrix,

1241
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:43,942
we retro-convert it
into DNA sequences.

1242
01:12:44,025 --> 01:12:45,444
And they grow here?

1243
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:47,154
It's not easy
augmenting the genome

1244
01:12:47,237 --> 01:12:49,781
to photosynthesize
Bio-sky, but...

1245
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:51,616
- We're getting there.
- [chuckles]

1246
01:12:52,367 --> 01:12:54,077
Go ahead. Try it.

1247
01:13:00,208 --> 01:13:01,501
[Niobe chuckles]

1248
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:03,795
We're quite excited
about the blueberries.

1249
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:05,797
You remember that shit
we used to eat?

1250
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:08,258
That slop
that tasted like rust.

1251
01:13:09,843 --> 01:13:13,472
Zion could have never
made something like this.

1252
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:15,182
Why?

1253
01:13:15,265 --> 01:13:17,851
Because we needed synthients

1254
01:13:17,934 --> 01:13:19,895
and DI like him.

1255
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:23,356
Zion was stuck in the past.
Stuck in war.

1256
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,817
Stuck in a Matrix of its own.

1257
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:29,779
They believed
that it had to be us or them.

1258
01:13:29,863 --> 01:13:32,866
This city was built by us

1259
01:13:32,949 --> 01:13:34,618
and them.

1260
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:41,833
What happened to Zion?

1261
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:45,337
I've been waiting
for you to ask that question.

1262
01:13:47,297 --> 01:13:50,759
All of the troubles
started in the Machine Cities.

1263
01:13:50,842 --> 01:13:54,554
Power plants were unable
to produce enough energy.

1264
01:13:54,638 --> 01:13:58,391
Nothing can breed violence
like scarcity.

1265
01:14:00,143 --> 01:14:01,728
For the first time,

1266
01:14:01,811 --> 01:14:05,023
<i>we saw machines at war
with one other.</i>

1267
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:12,030
We got word from the Oracle
of a new power rising.

1268
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:16,660
That was the last
we heard from her.

1269
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:21,706
Morpheus.

1270
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:26,169
[Niobe] After the siege,
he was elected unanimously.

1271
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:29,130
High Chair of the Council.

1272
01:14:29,214 --> 01:14:32,634
Oh, how he loved that. [scoffs]

1273
01:14:32,717 --> 01:14:36,930
But as rumors
of this new power spread,

1274
01:14:37,013 --> 01:14:38,431
he ignored them.

1275
01:14:38,515 --> 01:14:43,144
He was certain what you had
done could not be undone.

1276
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:47,190
All of these people never
stopped believing in miracles,

1277
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:49,651
believing in you.

1278
01:15:01,705 --> 01:15:03,081
I'm sorry.

1279
01:15:04,916 --> 01:15:07,335
How could I know
this would happen?

1280
01:15:07,419 --> 01:15:09,713
We didn't understand
all of it back then.

1281
01:15:09,796 --> 01:15:11,631
No more than we do now.

1282
01:15:11,715 --> 01:15:15,010
I didn't come here
to cause you problems, Niobe,

1283
01:15:16,052 --> 01:15:17,804
but I need your help.

1284
01:15:19,472 --> 01:15:20,932
Trinity is alive.

1285
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:22,767
Then there is
another question.

1286
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:24,644
Why did they keep her alive?

1287
01:15:24,728 --> 01:15:25,979
I can't answer that.

1288
01:15:26,062 --> 01:15:29,399
But if there's a chance
I can free her,

1289
01:15:29,482 --> 01:15:31,026
I have to try.

1290
01:15:31,109 --> 01:15:35,030
Even if it means endangering
everyone in this city?

1291
01:15:39,284 --> 01:15:40,994
I'm sorry, Neo.

1292
01:15:41,077 --> 01:15:44,748
I won't let what happened
to Zion happen to Io.

1293
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:47,917
I hope you'll forgive
an old woman

1294
01:15:48,001 --> 01:15:51,087
for asking you to go
with Sheperd, here,

1295
01:15:51,171 --> 01:15:52,672
till we have
better understanding

1296
01:15:52,756 --> 01:15:54,174
of what's going on.

1297
01:15:54,257 --> 01:15:57,302
You're going to imprison me
after I just got free?

1298
01:15:57,385 --> 01:16:01,181
I know it doesn't seem fair,

1299
01:16:01,264 --> 01:16:04,059
but neither does growing old.

1300
01:16:04,142 --> 01:16:06,269
But you don't
hear me complaining.

1301
01:16:09,022 --> 01:16:10,565
[elevator whirring]

1302
01:16:18,281 --> 01:16:20,116
Sorry.

1303
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,243
I've never met
a legend before.

1304
01:16:25,622 --> 01:16:26,706
Neo.

1305
01:16:27,999 --> 01:16:29,751
Sheperd. [breathes shakily]

1306
01:16:29,834 --> 01:16:31,044
[chuckles in disbelief]

1307
01:16:31,127 --> 01:16:32,962
Crazy. You're real.

1308
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:36,049
"Real."

1309
01:16:37,133 --> 01:16:39,135
There's that word again.

1310
01:16:44,641 --> 01:16:47,018
[Sheperd] People talk a lot
about the old days.

1311
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:49,354
About you, the viral Agent.

1312
01:16:49,437 --> 01:16:52,065
The siege of Zion.

1313
01:16:52,148 --> 01:16:54,150
Everything was simpler
back then.

1314
01:16:55,151 --> 01:16:56,736
People wanted to be free.

1315
01:16:58,822 --> 01:17:00,740
It's different now.

1316
01:17:00,824 --> 01:17:04,285
Sometimes it feels like
people gave up.

1317
01:17:05,537 --> 01:17:07,247
Like the Matrix won.

1318
01:17:07,330 --> 01:17:08,623
[unlocks door]

1319
01:17:10,041 --> 01:17:11,459
This is you.

1320
01:17:15,463 --> 01:17:17,757
And I gotta ask you one thing.

1321
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:21,511
Is it true you could fly?

1322
01:17:26,349 --> 01:17:27,350
Cool.

1323
01:17:32,355 --> 01:17:33,606
[locks door]

1324
01:17:47,036 --> 01:17:48,413
[trickling]

1325
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:57,797
[Morpheus grunts]

1326
01:17:57,881 --> 01:17:59,174
Morpheus.

1327
01:17:59,257 --> 01:18:02,177
Oh. General stuck you
in the Rapunzel tower.

1328
01:18:03,511 --> 01:18:04,554
[Morpheus exhales]

1329
01:18:04,637 --> 01:18:06,139
On the upside,
it's a nice view.

1330
01:18:06,222 --> 01:18:08,308
What happened to Bugs
and the others?

1331
01:18:08,391 --> 01:18:10,101
They're supposed to be
sterilizing the <i>Mnemosyne</i>

1332
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:12,312
- with a toothbrush.
- "Supposed to be"?

1333
01:18:12,395 --> 01:18:13,730
Well, I could tell you
that they're standing by,

1334
01:18:13,813 --> 01:18:15,064
waiting for you
to make the choice

1335
01:18:15,148 --> 01:18:16,983
to remain meekly incarcerated

1336
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:19,402
or bust the hell out of here
and go and find Trinity.

1337
01:18:20,987 --> 01:18:22,072
But that ain't a choice.

1338
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:26,409
[dramatic music playing]

1339
01:18:34,709 --> 01:18:36,836
[Sheperd] General,
what should we do?

1340
01:18:40,256 --> 01:18:42,842
[Freya] Bugs has the same
independence of mind

1341
01:18:42,926 --> 01:18:44,385
she had the day you freed her.

1342
01:18:44,469 --> 01:18:47,472
This is not
independence of mind.

1343
01:18:47,555 --> 01:18:48,598
It's mutiny.

1344
01:18:49,933 --> 01:18:51,184
[Freya] Come on, 'Be.

1345
01:18:51,267 --> 01:18:54,270
I know how much
you hated locking him up.

1346
01:18:54,354 --> 01:18:57,065
Just like I know
there's a part of you

1347
01:18:57,148 --> 01:19:00,193
that's relieved now
that he's gone.

1348
01:19:01,653 --> 01:19:05,490
We've worked so hard
to keep Io safe.

1349
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:09,869
This scares me.

1350
01:19:20,421 --> 01:19:21,714
That's her.

1351
01:19:21,798 --> 01:19:22,924
[Seq] On the bridge.

1352
01:19:23,466 --> 01:19:24,467
Got her.

1353
01:19:31,224 --> 01:19:33,059
[engine revving]

1354
01:19:33,143 --> 01:19:35,395
It's sick
how the Semblance works.

1355
01:19:35,478 --> 01:19:38,231
You see flashes
of the real her, but...

1356
01:19:38,314 --> 01:19:39,941
the way she reads...

1357
01:19:41,651 --> 01:19:44,279
Code-wise,
she's pure bluepill.

1358
01:19:46,155 --> 01:19:49,242
This is a tough question, Neo,
but it has to be asked.

1359
01:19:50,368 --> 01:19:52,537
What if she's happy
where she is?

1360
01:19:53,997 --> 01:19:55,248
How did I read?

1361
01:19:57,333 --> 01:19:59,252
Exactly like her.

1362
01:20:03,006 --> 01:20:05,258
Take us to broadcast depth.

1363
01:20:05,341 --> 01:20:07,760
[suspenseful music playing]

1364
01:20:16,561 --> 01:20:18,021
Thank you for helping me.

1365
01:20:19,647 --> 01:20:21,649
Most of us are here
because of you.

1366
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:25,445
I also admit our only chance

1367
01:20:25,528 --> 01:20:26,946
to get out
of the general's doghouse

1368
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:28,656
is for you to find your mojo.

1369
01:20:30,366 --> 01:20:32,952
What if I can't be
what I once was?

1370
01:20:34,495 --> 01:20:36,122
- Then we're all fucked.
- [signal beeps]

1371
01:20:36,205 --> 01:20:37,582
[Hanno] Two minutes.

1372
01:20:37,665 --> 01:20:39,042
Two minutes to broadcast.

1373
01:20:48,217 --> 01:20:49,552
[Seq] I slipped you in
through a hotel room.

1374
01:20:49,636 --> 01:20:51,304
[Seq chuckles]

1375
01:20:51,387 --> 01:20:52,847
Should be safe.

1376
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:05,151
Portal's open.

1377
01:21:05,234 --> 01:21:07,362
Closest I could get you is
the warehouse near her garage.

1378
01:21:07,445 --> 01:21:08,988
Whole zone's
crawling with bots.

1379
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:11,908
Let's go.

1380
01:21:39,143 --> 01:21:42,271
So, what do you think of him?

1381
01:21:42,355 --> 01:21:45,149
I was kinda worried at first
because he's so much older.

1382
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:47,735
The beard, the hair... Oh.

1383
01:21:47,819 --> 01:21:51,239
- No, totally works for me.
- [scoffs] You idiot.

1384
01:21:51,322 --> 01:21:52,699
I mean "The One" thing.

1385
01:21:54,367 --> 01:21:57,328
You know, everyone that
shipped with him died.

1386
01:21:57,412 --> 01:22:00,206
Oh, yeah. He's gonna
get us all killed, for sure.

1387
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:04,752
[guns cocking]

1388
01:22:05,586 --> 01:22:07,130
Predictable as ever.

1389
01:22:09,382 --> 01:22:11,134
Smith.

1390
01:22:11,217 --> 01:22:13,553
Smith? As in, "the" Smith?

1391
01:22:13,636 --> 01:22:14,637
[chuckles]

1392
01:22:21,686 --> 01:22:22,979
This is so insane.

1393
01:22:23,062 --> 01:22:24,313
There's so many theories
about the two of them

1394
01:22:24,397 --> 01:22:26,065
and they're standing
right there.

1395
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:27,734
This code is freaky!

1396
01:22:27,817 --> 01:22:30,695
He's like an Agent, but not.

1397
01:22:34,866 --> 01:22:36,451
An appeal to reason.

1398
01:22:40,663 --> 01:22:42,165
How did you find us?

1399
01:22:42,248 --> 01:22:45,168
You never appreciated
our relationship.

1400
01:22:45,251 --> 01:22:46,627
Not like The Analyst.

1401
01:22:46,711 --> 01:22:48,629
- The what?
- My doctor.

1402
01:22:48,713 --> 01:22:52,425
He used our bond
and turned it into a chain.

1403
01:22:52,508 --> 01:22:54,177
It's so obvious
once you see it, right?

1404
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:57,680
But this whole altered-code
update really blew my mind.

1405
01:22:57,764 --> 01:22:59,766
I still don't know
how he did it.

1406
01:22:59,849 --> 01:23:02,643
You, as a balding nerd.

1407
01:23:02,727 --> 01:23:04,479
Hilarious.

1408
01:23:04,562 --> 01:23:06,939
And me... [sighs]

1409
01:23:07,023 --> 01:23:09,692
even more perfect.

1410
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:11,778
Maybe a little too far
on the piercing blue eyes.

1411
01:23:11,861 --> 01:23:13,780
What do you think?

1412
01:23:13,863 --> 01:23:15,823
What do you want, Smith?

1413
01:23:17,992 --> 01:23:20,286
I have such dreams, Tom.

1414
01:23:20,369 --> 01:23:22,080
Big dreams.

1415
01:23:22,163 --> 01:23:24,916
Well, mostly just extremely
violent revenge fantasies,

1416
01:23:24,999 --> 01:23:26,417
but in order for me
to pursue mine,

1417
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:28,544
I need to dissuade you
from pursuing yours.

1418
01:23:28,628 --> 01:23:32,256
Hmm. Sounds like conflict.

1419
01:23:33,966 --> 01:23:35,510
Inevitable?

1420
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:38,054
Doesn't have to be.

1421
01:23:38,137 --> 01:23:40,306
All you have to do
is stay out of the Matrix,

1422
01:23:40,389 --> 01:23:41,891
and leave
the good doctor to me.

1423
01:23:41,974 --> 01:23:44,310
You can have him.
I'm here for Trinity.

1424
01:23:44,393 --> 01:23:45,895
That's the trouble, Tom.

1425
01:23:45,978 --> 01:23:48,648
He knew you'd come,
just like I did.

1426
01:23:48,731 --> 01:23:50,316
[scoffs]

1427
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:51,609
Trust me.

1428
01:23:52,568 --> 01:23:54,112
You're not ready for him.

1429
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:56,989
Captain, I'm reading portals
from the lower frequencies.

1430
01:24:02,286 --> 01:24:05,456
I won't have his leash
on my neck again.

1431
01:24:12,922 --> 01:24:15,174
I found some
old acquaintances of yours.

1432
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:19,595
- Bugs!

[snarls]

1435
01:24:33,276 --> 01:24:34,318
Exiles.

1436
01:24:34,402 --> 01:24:35,570
I thought
they were all purged.

1437
01:24:35,653 --> 01:24:37,155
[man] You?

1438
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:38,364
[excitedly] Oh!

1439
01:24:38,447 --> 01:24:40,783
It is you!

1440
01:24:40,867 --> 01:24:42,034
[man speaking French]

1441
01:24:42,118 --> 01:24:45,705
All these years.
I can't believe it.

1442
01:24:46,372 --> 01:24:48,040
Oh, God.

1443
01:24:48,124 --> 01:24:52,086
You stole my life!

1444

1445
01:24:56,841 --> 01:24:58,384
[in English] What the Merv
is trying to say,

01:36:56,935 --> 01:36:58,353
It's all about fiction.

1627
01:36:58,437 --> 01:37:03,108
The only world that matters
is the one in here.

1628
01:37:03,192 --> 01:37:06,194
And you people
believe the craziest shit.

1629
01:37:06,737 --> 01:37:07,988
Why?

1630
01:37:08,071 --> 01:37:10,657
What validates
and makes your fictions real?

1631
01:37:11,617 --> 01:37:12,701
Feelings.

1632
01:37:13,869 --> 01:37:15,329
Allow me.

1633
01:37:16,705 --> 01:37:18,373
Kush, here,
is one of my handlers.

1634
01:37:18,457 --> 01:37:19,791
They're everywhere.

1635
01:37:19,875 --> 01:37:22,461
Such a pain, cloning Agents
over a coppertop.

1636
01:37:22,544 --> 01:37:25,005
Far more effective
just to saturate a population.

1637
01:37:26,924 --> 01:37:29,801
And, bonus,
swarm mode is sick fun.

1638
01:37:29,885 --> 01:37:31,094

[gun fires in slow motion]

1640
01:37:42,230 --> 01:37:45,359
Ooh! Nicely done.

1641
01:37:46,818 --> 01:37:50,072
You ever wonder
why you have nightmares?

1642
01:37:50,155 --> 01:37:53,116
Why your own brain
tortures you?

1643
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:56,703
It's actually us,
maximizing your output.

1644
01:37:56,787 --> 01:37:57,955
It works just like this.

1645
01:37:58,038 --> 01:38:00,666
Oh, no!
Can you stop the bullet?

1646
01:38:00,749 --> 01:38:03,669
If only you could move faster.

1647
01:38:03,752 --> 01:38:06,296
[chuckles] Here's the thing
about feelings.

1648
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:08,674
They're so much easier
to control than facts.

1649
01:38:09,633 --> 01:38:11,510
Turns out, in my Matrix,

1650
01:38:11,593 --> 01:38:15,055
the worse we treat you,
the more we manipulate you,

1651
01:38:15,138 --> 01:38:17,599
the more energy you produce.

1652
01:38:17,683 --> 01:38:19,893
It's nuts. [chomps]

1653

1654

every year since I took over.

1655
01:38:23,021 --> 01:38:25,857
And, the best part,
zero resistance.

1656
01:38:25,941 --> 01:38:27,317
People stay in their pods,

1657
01:38:27,401 --> 01:38:30,487
happier than pigs in shit.

1658
01:38:30,570 --> 01:38:31,780
The key to it all?

1659
01:38:31,863 --> 01:38:33,198
You.

1660
01:38:33,281 --> 01:38:34,449
And her.

1661
01:38:34,533 --> 01:38:36,743
Quietly yearning
for what you don't have,

1662

while dreading
losing what you do.

1663
01:38:39,329 --> 01:38:40,998
For 99.9% of your race,

1664
01:38:41,081 --> 01:38:43,750
that is the definition
of reality.

1665

Desire and fear, baby.

1666
01:38:46,795 --> 01:38:49,756
Just give the people
what they want, right?

[squelches]

you have, Thomas.

1669

- You shouldn't call me that.
- I'm sorry.

1677
01:39:28,045 --> 01:39:29,296
I have to go.

1678
01:39:29,379 --> 01:39:30,547
But I'll be back.

1679
01:39:31,673 --> 01:39:33,967

[Sheperd on radio]
<i>General ordered me</i>

1683
01:39:40,807 --> 01:39:41,808
<i>to look after the ship.</i>

1684
01:39:41,892 --> 01:39:43,769
So you shadowed us?

1685
01:39:43,852 --> 01:39:45,437
Check your long-range scans.

1687
01:39:47,606 --> 01:39:49,066
He's right.

1688
01:39:49,149 --> 01:39:50,317
You can stay here and die,

1689
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,778
or come back
and face a court-martial.

1690
01:39:52,861 --> 01:39:54,863
And you call that a choice?

1691
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:04,206
[Niobe] Sheperd should have
left you to the Squids.

1692
01:40:04,289 --> 01:40:07,667
I'm too damn old to sit
through some boring-ass trial.

1693
01:40:07,751 --> 01:40:08,960
Niobe, don't blame Bugs.

1694
01:40:09,044 --> 01:40:10,962
Do shut your mouth.

1695
01:40:11,046 --> 01:40:13,340
Do address me as General.

1696
01:40:13,423 --> 01:40:17,677
And do not rob
my ex-captain of her agency,

1697
01:40:17,761 --> 01:40:19,763
which she exercised
with her own

1698

particular brand
of shortsighted stupidity.

1699
01:40:24,601 --> 01:40:25,685
Shortsighted?

1700
01:40:27,354 --> 01:40:31,316
You care more about growing
fruit than freeing minds.

1701

We are not going
to have this argument again.

1702

It's not an argument.
It's a fact.

1703
01:40:36,404 --> 01:40:37,614
You gave up on people.

1704
01:40:39,074 --> 01:40:41,409
I tell you
what I'm going to give up on

1705
01:40:41,493 --> 01:40:42,577
and it's you!

1706

01:41:15,819 --> 01:41:17,112
Thank you for seeing me.

1717
01:41:17,195 --> 01:41:18,989
I figured if there was anyone

1718
01:41:19,072 --> 01:41:21,366
who could make sense
of this mess,

1719
01:41:21,449 --> 01:41:23,243
it would be you.

I know you.

My father knew
we'd meet again,

1729
01:41:44,139 --> 01:41:47,100
though he would have wished
for happier circumstances.

1730
01:41:47,184 --> 01:41:48,977
His inadvertent role
in what happened to you

1731
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:51,313
was the greatest regret
of his life.

1732
01:41:51,396 --> 01:41:53,273
I don't understand.

1733
01:41:54,649 --> 01:41:56,318
My father
was the chief engineer

1734
01:41:56,401 --> 01:41:57,652
at the Anomaleum.

1735
01:41:57,736 --> 01:41:59,112
[Niobe] The what?

1736
01:41:59,196 --> 01:42:02,282

the resurrection pods

where Neo and Trinity
were imprisoned.

1738
01:42:06,328 --> 01:42:07,579
[Niobe] I'm sorry.

1739
01:42:07,662 --> 01:42:09,164
You knew what happened to him?

1740
01:42:09,247 --> 01:42:12,459
You knew that he and Trinity
both were alive...

1741
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:14,753
and you didn't tell me?

1742
01:42:14,836 --> 01:42:17,756
There were times
I doubted my decision, Niobe.

1743
01:42:17,839 --> 01:42:19,466
But Io needed you.

1744
01:42:19,549 --> 01:42:20,884
This city needed to be built

1745
01:42:20,967 --> 01:42:23,011
for your people
as well as mine.

1746
01:42:24,179 --> 01:42:25,931
If I would have
told you everything,

1747
01:42:26,014 --> 01:42:28,183
you would have had a very
difficult choice to make.

1749
01:42:31,186 --> 01:42:33,688

01:42:33,772 --> 01:42:35,690
If it was a mistake,

1751
01:42:35,774 --> 01:42:37,859
you have my deepest apologies.

1752
01:42:39,945 --> 01:42:41,279
Why are you here now?

1753
01:42:41,363 --> 01:42:43,865

destabilized the Matrix.

draws its current

1755
01:42:45,283 --> 01:42:46,618
from Trinity alone now.

1756
01:42:46,701 --> 01:42:48,870
A fail-safe has been
triggered to reset

1757

the Matrix back
to the previous version.

1758
01:42:51,039 --> 01:42:52,832
But The Analyst
halted the reset.

1759
01:42:52,916 --> 01:42:54,209
He's convinced the authorities

1760
01:42:54,292 --> 01:42:56,253
that you will soon
return voluntarily.

1761
01:42:57,379 --> 01:42:59,297
And why would he say that?

1762
01:42:59,381 --> 01:43:02,467
Because if I don't go back,
he'll kill Trinity.

1763

to your pod

1764

01:43:10,558 --> 01:43:11,851
What would you choose, Neo?

1766
01:43:12,936 --> 01:43:14,229
I'll go back.

1767
01:43:15,939 --> 01:43:18,149
Well, The Analyst
knows you well,

1768
01:43:18,233 --> 01:43:20,986
but that knowledge
has made him incautious.

1769
01:43:21,069 --> 01:43:22,737
After you escaped,

1770
01:43:22,821 --> 01:43:25,657
he should have accepted his
losses and devacuated Trinity.

1771
01:43:25,740 --> 01:43:28,618
But that would have prevented
this extraordinary opportunity

1772
01:43:28,702 --> 01:43:30,620
that now exists before us.

1773
01:43:31,288 --> 01:43:34,207
A few hours ago,

1774
01:43:34,291 --> 01:43:37,585
no one would have been able
to convince me

1775
01:43:37,669 --> 01:43:41,965
that I would be standing here,
trying to explain a mission

1776

- Volunteering.
- Oh, no.

You are the one captain
that I am ordering to go.

have to order me, General,

You don't even know
what it is.

01:44:13,413 --> 01:44:16,333
General, we know you.

1786
01:44:16,416 --> 01:44:17,625
If you say this is important,

1787
01:44:17,709 --> 01:44:19,753
none of us is
choosing to stay home.

1788
01:44:25,133 --> 01:44:26,217
Thank you.

1789
01:44:31,306 --> 01:44:33,308

1796

So, stealth will be paramount.

As long as we raise no alarms,

1798
01:45:15,350 --> 01:45:17,435

should be the easiest.

guarded by thousands
of Sentinels?

1803
01:45:24,109 --> 01:45:25,276
That's the easy part?

1804
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:27,028
Exactly so.

1805
01:45:27,112 --> 01:45:29,447
Because all we have to do
is convince someone

1806
01:45:29,531 --> 01:45:31,199
who does this every day

1807
01:45:31,282 --> 01:45:32,700
to take one of us along.

1809
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:58,059
Fifty meters
below the Anomaleum

1810
01:45:58,143 --> 01:45:59,644
is a stratum
of amniotic filters.

1811
01:45:59,727 --> 01:46:03,148
Hidden along this edge
is a small hexagonal vent.

1812
01:46:03,231 --> 01:46:06,401
<i>This vent feeds the air intake
into the corpuscular modifier,</i>

1813
01:46:06,484 --> 01:46:09,571
<i>which oxygenates
the bio-gel used in Neo's pod.</i>

1814
01:46:10,238 --> 01:46:11,448
I get it.

1815
01:46:11,531 --> 01:46:14,409
The exomorph slinkies up
Neo's old umbilicus.

1816
01:46:15,660 --> 01:46:16,786
What could go wrong?

In order to unplug
Trinity's body,

1825
01:47:15,136 --> 01:47:17,347
while her mind still remains
connected to the Matrix,

1826
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:19,057
I'm gonna need
a second human brain

1827
01:47:19,140 --> 01:47:20,350
to implement the bypass.

1828
01:47:20,433 --> 01:47:22,060
And since Neo
must be with The Analyst,

1829
01:47:22,143 --> 01:47:25,313
the only available mind
that's a near-enough match

1830
01:47:25,396 --> 01:47:26,439
is yours.

1831
01:47:27,982 --> 01:47:28,900
Figures.

1832
01:47:28,983 --> 01:47:30,568
[tense music playing]

1833
01:47:46,417 --> 01:47:47,544

[grunts]

1835
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:57,762
Does Trinity still have
to take the red pill?

1836
01:47:57,845 --> 01:47:59,264
Since Kujaku and I
are transferring

1837
01:47:59,347 --> 01:48:00,640
her consciousness
onto the ship,

1838
01:48:00,723 --> 01:48:02,392
it's not strictly necessary.

1839
01:48:02,475 --> 01:48:06,396
But what matters is that
this is her choice.

1840
01:48:06,479 --> 01:48:09,774
Extracting a confused
or an uncertain mind will,

1841
01:48:09,857 --> 01:48:11,234
in all probability, kill her.

1842
01:48:11,317 --> 01:48:13,861
But even if it is
what she wants,

1843
01:48:13,945 --> 01:48:17,615
won't The Analyst just order
the Sentinels to stop you?

1844
01:48:17,699 --> 01:48:19,200
He will.

1845
01:48:19,284 --> 01:48:21,744
But if my plan works,
it won't matter.

1846
01:48:21,828 --> 01:48:22,787
Why?

1847
01:48:22,870 --> 01:48:24,497
Because we'll already be gone.

1848
01:48:26,207 --> 01:48:28,126
Somebody thinks
this hard about a plan,

1849
01:48:28,209 --> 01:48:29,627
there has to be a reason why.

1850
01:48:31,838 --> 01:48:33,047
When my father realized

1851
01:48:33,131 --> 01:48:35,383
how the Anomaleum
was going to be used,

1852
01:48:35,466 --> 01:48:38,928
he covertly transferred
the designs to me.

1853
01:48:39,012 --> 01:48:41,514
The Analyst
discovered his betrayal

1854
01:48:41,598 --> 01:48:43,474
and had my parents purged.

1855
01:48:44,642 --> 01:48:46,019
[inhales sharply]

1856
01:48:46,102 --> 01:48:49,105
I would have been murdered too
if it wasn't for Kujaku.

1857
01:48:52,150 --> 01:48:56,154
Not a day goes by
that I don't grieve them.

1858
01:48:56,237 --> 01:48:59,365
I've been praying for this day
for a very long time.

I thought you should know
that I'm here because of her.

1862

All I ever wanted was to be
as fearless as Trinity.

1863

But I saw how she reacted
in the garage, and I...

1864
01:49:27,185 --> 01:49:29,812
You're wondering if I'm wrong.

1865
01:49:29,896 --> 01:49:31,439
What if we're too late?

1866
01:49:33,232 --> 01:49:34,942
What if she's not
Trinity anymore?

[sighs]

1868
01:49:40,365 --> 01:49:43,117
I never believed
I was The One.

1869
01:49:43,993 --> 01:49:45,411
But she did.

1870
01:49:46,454 --> 01:49:48,081
She believed in me.

1871
01:49:50,750 --> 01:49:52,960
It's my turn
to believe in her.

[suspenseful music continues]

1880
01:51:15,918 --> 01:51:17,837
Welcome home.

1881
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:20,298
All I want is to talk to her.

1882
01:51:20,381 --> 01:51:22,008
Do you mean Tiff?

1883
01:51:22,091 --> 01:51:24,844
Come back, and you can talk
to her as often as you like.

1884
01:51:24,927 --> 01:51:26,304
I mean, handsome Chad

1885
01:51:26,387 --> 01:51:27,847
may have something
to say about it.

1886
01:51:27,930 --> 01:51:31,225
If she tells me
this is what she wants,

1887
01:51:32,435 --> 01:51:33,603
you win.

1888
01:51:33,686 --> 01:51:34,812
Really?

1889
01:51:34,896 --> 01:51:37,648
But if she wants me,

1890
01:51:37,732 --> 01:51:39,567
then you'll let us go free.

1891
01:51:39,650 --> 01:51:42,403
And why would I do something
as stupid as that?

1892
01:51:42,487 --> 01:51:45,281
Right now, I'm on a ship full
of people who will unplug me

1893
01:51:45,364 --> 01:51:48,367
before they'll let you
take me back.

1894
01:51:48,451 --> 01:51:50,495
If you want this Matrix,

1895
01:51:50,578 --> 01:51:52,121
this is your only chance.

1896
01:51:52,205 --> 01:51:55,166
But how do I know
they won't unplug you anyway?

1897
01:51:55,249 --> 01:51:58,586
Same way I know you'll let us
walk out of here.

Okay.

1900
01:52:25,947 --> 01:52:27,448
I like tests.

1901
01:52:28,324 --> 01:52:30,117
We'll let Tiff decide.

That's it.

1905

Bypass is ready.

1906
01:52:51,472 --> 01:52:53,182
Now what?

1907
01:52:53,266 --> 01:52:54,517
We wait.

1908
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:56,561
Doesn't it seem crazy
to come all this way

1909
01:52:56,644 --> 01:52:58,229
and leave her here?

1910
01:52:58,312 --> 01:53:00,982
We must abide by her decision.

1911
01:53:01,065 --> 01:53:02,650
And if she says no,

1912
01:53:03,484 --> 01:53:04,944
what happens to Neo?

1913
01:53:05,027 --> 01:53:06,237
At this time,

1914
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:09,156
the most important choice
of Neo's life

1915
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:10,741
is not his to make.

[slow suspenseful
music playing]

If I was the Oracle,
maybe I could explain it.

1919
01:53:49,155 --> 01:53:50,740
The Oracle.

1920
01:53:50,823 --> 01:53:52,491
From your game?

1921
01:53:54,368 --> 01:53:56,621
It's not a game.

1922
01:53:58,748 --> 01:53:59,957
Oh, God.

[Tiffany sighs]

1924
01:54:07,423 --> 01:54:10,843
After you left, I went home

1925
01:54:10,927 --> 01:54:12,637
and I played it.

1926
01:54:15,014 --> 01:54:17,475
I kept thinking,

1927
01:54:17,558 --> 01:54:20,895
why does this story
feel like a memory?

1928
01:54:28,069 --> 01:54:29,820
There's a part of me

1929
01:54:32,406 --> 01:54:35,618
that feels like I have been
waiting my whole life for you.

1930
01:54:38,579 --> 01:54:40,831
And that part is like,

1931
01:54:40,915 --> 01:54:44,627
"What the hell
took you so long?" [sniffles]

1932
01:54:44,710 --> 01:54:46,754
I don't have an easy answer.

1933
01:54:48,923 --> 01:54:51,092
Maybe I was afraid of this.

1934
01:54:52,551 --> 01:54:54,428
Afraid of what might happen.

1935
01:54:55,930 --> 01:54:58,933
Afraid of hurting
the only person I ever loved.

1936
01:55:00,643 --> 01:55:04,188
I wish I was
who you think I am.

1937
01:55:05,564 --> 01:55:07,149
But look at me.

1938
01:55:08,442 --> 01:55:10,611
I can't be her.

1939
01:55:10,695 --> 01:55:12,822
- [Donnie] Mom!
- [Brandon] Mom! Come on.

1940
01:55:12,905 --> 01:55:14,156
- Mom!
- It's Callie.

1941
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:15,241
Is this real?

1942
01:55:15,324 --> 01:55:16,492

You have to come with us.

[Brandon] Come on,
we gotta go.

Tiff, hey. Don't know
what's going on here,

1945
01:55:19,620 --> 01:55:20,955
but I'm glad we found you.

1946
01:55:21,038 --> 01:55:22,331
- She got hit by a car!
- I know, it's crazy.

1947
01:55:22,415 --> 01:55:23,541

It's too late.

1952
01:55:29,547 --> 01:55:30,756
I understand.

1953
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:32,675
- Tiff, come on, let's go.
- [Donnie] Come on.

1954
01:55:39,181 --> 01:55:40,266
What's happening?

1955
01:55:42,351 --> 01:55:43,477
Neo was wrong.

to come with us.

I wish you would
fucking stop calling me that.

I hate that name.

1962
01:56:36,197 --> 01:56:37,740
My name is Trinity

1963
01:56:37,823 --> 01:56:40,201
and you better
take your hands off of me.

Aye-yi-yi, what a mess.

I own that mistake.
Shouldn't have pressed.

Women used to be
so easy to control.

1973

You know there's no way
I can let you two go free.

1974
01:57:24,537 --> 01:57:25,996
Cannot happen.

1975
01:57:29,166 --> 01:57:32,002
So, I guess it's deja vu
all over again.

02:15:31,289 --> 02:15:34,209
They don't want
this sentimentality.

2160
02:15:34,292 --> 02:15:36,211
They don't want
freedom or empowerment.

2161
02:15:36,294 --> 02:15:38,713
They want to be controlled.

2162
02:15:38,796 --> 02:15:40,757
They crave
the comfort of certainty.

2163
02:15:40,840 --> 02:15:43,593
And that means you two,
back in your pods,

2164
02:15:43,676 --> 02:15:47,222
unconscious and alone,
just like them.

2165
02:15:49,140 --> 02:15:51,392
[both chuckle]

2166
02:15:51,476 --> 02:15:54,187
We're not here
to negotiate anything.

2167
02:15:54,270 --> 02:15:56,522
We were on our way
to remake your world.

2168
02:15:56,606 --> 02:15:58,149
Change a few things.

2169
02:15:58,233 --> 02:15:59,442
I kind of like

2170
02:15:59,525 --> 02:16:00,860
the "paint the sky
with rainbows" idea.

2171
02:16:00,944 --> 02:16:02,862
Just remind people
what a free mind can do.

2172
02:16:02,946 --> 02:16:04,447
I forgot. It's easy to forget.

2173
02:16:04,530 --> 02:16:06,950
- He makes it easy.
- That, he does.

2174
02:16:07,033 --> 02:16:09,244
Something he should
think about.

2175
02:16:10,245 --> 02:16:11,454
Before we got started,

2176
02:16:11,537 --> 02:16:14,374
we decided to stop by
to say thank you.

2177
02:16:14,457 --> 02:16:17,543
You gave us something
we never thought we could have.

2178
02:16:17,627 --> 02:16:19,003
And what is that?

2179
02:16:19,879 --> 02:16:21,673
Another chance.

2180
02:16:21,756 --> 02:16:23,675
[punk rock music playing]

2181
02:27:24,919 --> 02:27:27,713
Face reality, people.
Movies are dead.

2182
02:27:27,796 --> 02:27:29,715
Games are dead.

2183
02:27:29,798 --> 02:27:31,550
Narrative? Dead.

2184
02:27:31,634 --> 02:27:33,594
Media is nothing
but neuro-trigger response

2185
02:27:33,677 --> 02:27:34,887
and viral conditioning.

2186
02:27:34,970 --> 02:27:36,472
Wait, what are you two
talking about?

2187
02:27:38,724 --> 02:27:40,559
Cat videos.

2188
02:27:40,643 --> 02:27:44,396
What we need is
a series of videos

2189
02:27:44,480 --> 02:27:46,815
that we call "The Catrix."
