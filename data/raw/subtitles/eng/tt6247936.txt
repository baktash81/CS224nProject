2
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:25,981
He has not come yet.

3
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,507
You're going to drive me crazy.

4
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,227
Let's start without him.

5
00:03:29,294 --> 00:03:30,629
As in Charleroi.

6
00:03:30,654 --> 00:03:31,987
Shut up.

7
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,848
But in Paris, they want Django.

8
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:02,619
Django, what are you doing?
You have to come!

9
00:04:05,872 --> 00:04:08,082
What are you doing?
We are waiting for you.

10
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:09,694
Look what I got.

11
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,026
Have you seen one of these?

12
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:12,795
A catfish.

13
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:15,381
Come on, quick!

14
00:04:15,548 --> 00:04:17,592
I'm hurrying, see.

15
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,060
Do not.

16
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:23,264
You can be sure...

17
00:04:23,473 --> 00:04:25,642
I'll cook them for you.
You will see.

18
00:04:27,193 --> 00:04:28,577
Are not they beautiful?

19
00:04:28,645 --> 00:04:30,477
Catfish is not pretty.

20
00:04:30,502 --> 00:04:32,506
Do not talk bad about your mustache.

21
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:35,109
Mr. Django's car is on the way.

22
00:04:41,908 --> 00:04:43,576
- Hey, take it easy...
- Come on!

23
00:04:44,786 --> 00:04:46,263
There you are, we're late.

24
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:47,587
Wear your suit.

25
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:49,215
You, on the track.
Two fishes.

26
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:51,484
- Magnificent.
- Get out.

27
00:04:51,586 --> 00:04:53,659
I'll cook them.
With a little salsa.

28
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:55,130
- Charles!
- Yes?

29
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:56,596
Can I get you a drink?

30
00:04:56,673 --> 00:04:58,007
Wear your brother.

31
00:04:58,174 --> 00:04:59,509
Yes, let's go.

32
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,055
Drop that glass!

33
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:06,432
It's time for you to go.

34
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:09,769
Oh, Mommy.

35
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:20,113
Sorry for the delay, we
had a technical incident.

36
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,281
Ladies and gentlemen,

37
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:24,742
in some moments,

38
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:26,285
Django Reinhardt

39
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:28,913
and the French Hot Club.

40
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,790
Very good night.

41
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:42,660
Stop, you're strangling me.
You hurt me!

42
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:44,028
- You got fat.
- Stop!

43
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:45,645
- Move it!
- It's fine.

44
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:47,640
- Your rape!
- Ready.

45
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,234
Let's go!

46
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:05,199
All right, everybody.
Shit.

47
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,207
On here.
It is tuned.

48
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:14,966
I hope it is.

49
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,296
Jean "Django" Reinhardt

50
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,466
was one of the greatest
guitarists of all time.

51
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,137
A gypsy who played
American black music

52
00:06:25,138 --> 00:06:27,466
in full Paris occupied
by the German Reich.

53
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,066
He wore only two fingers
of his left hand.

54
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,866
Another translation project
from the group's war films:

55
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:38,866
sU-Boots - submerged in wars -

56
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,166
Subtitles:
Fred Cipriano

57
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,766
Join our Facebook group

58
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,166
and follow our projects.

59
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,056
Good night madam.

60
00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:29,427
"Do you want a place?"
- No, thank you.

61
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:34,473
Forbidden to dance

62
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:07,439
You look great tonight.

63
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,717
You can do better.
But it is more expensive.

64
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,661
Lu Plume will go
blind in his ears.

65
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,800
Mam Ã£ e.

66
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,003
It went very well, my son.

67
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:57,778
Good evening, Mrs. Negros.

68
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,049
- Bravo, Django.
- Thank you.

69
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:04,326
You set the theater
on fire tonight.

70
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:07,163
You are a genius.
No shadow of lives.

71
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:09,548
Do you know Captain Effmann?

72
00:13:09,615 --> 00:13:12,526
He who organized the tour
in Germany we talked about.

73
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,244
We have the agreement of the embassy.

74
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,839
- Good evening, Mr. Effmann.
- Good evening.

75
00:13:17,006 --> 00:13:18,306
Congratulations.

76
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:20,551
It was a very
"diversified" show.

77
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,268
Funny.

78
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,965
Yes, but it will still
be necessary...

79
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,775
that you have a
little discipline.

80
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:31,645
Here in Paris, you
do what you want.

81
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,440
Because he is the great
animator of our army.

82
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:36,775
But in Germany, it's
something else.

83
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:39,278
We should tone down a bit.

84
00:13:39,445 --> 00:13:42,865
No more black people.

85
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:46,035
These bouncy rhythms,
breaks, blues...

86
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:48,454
People dancing in the living room.

87
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:50,171
You got it?

88
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:53,382
Louise?

89
00:13:56,429 --> 00:13:58,506
What are you doing here?
I'll introduce you.

90
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:02,051
- Werner Effmann.
- Madame.

91
00:14:02,218 --> 00:14:03,518
Lieutenant Von Schulz

92
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:06,013
who worked at
Deutsche Gramophone.

93
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,308
- He's our Doctor Jazz.
- I know who you are.

94
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,228
You recorded a record
with Grappelli.

95
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,063
Ah yes, it's true.

96
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,795
"Who are you, ma'am?"
- Sorry.

97
00:14:16,797 --> 00:14:19,361
Louise De Klerk, queen of
the Montparnasse nights.

98
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:21,286
What do you know
about my nights?

99
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,306
I have to leave you.

100
00:14:24,308 --> 00:14:26,826
Take this to prepare your trip.

101
00:14:27,243 --> 00:14:28,884
These are our instructions.

102
00:14:28,886 --> 00:14:31,872
If you have any life, check
with Lieutenant Kh n.

103
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:34,583
Our dear friend.
Gentlemen...

104
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:37,927
I'll take you to the exit.

105
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:41,048
Montparnasse, good times.

106
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:43,384
Louis Armstrong, La Coupole...

107
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:45,594
How is he, old Grappelli?

108
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:48,138
He's been in London for 3
years, loving the weather.

109
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:51,433
I will not leave Pigalle.

110
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:53,693
Excuse me...

111
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,034
So?

112
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:05,105
He's an artist, you
know how it is...

113
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:07,408
I know him, I'll talk to him.

114
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:09,535
Do not underestimate me.

115
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:12,162
Why do you want to take him there?

116
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:14,957
Many stars come to Germany.

117
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:18,544
The French who work there
need a distraction.

118
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:20,212
Even Edith Piaf and I will go.

119
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:21,730
They are not gypsies.

120
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:25,484
You're like Java, back
and forth, then some...

121
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:27,803
I returned to Belgium.
Paris lost me.

122
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:30,222
I miss Belgium.

123
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:32,016
At this beautiful concert.

124
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,482
- Come on!
- Come on!

125
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:36,186
- Come on!
- To you, Django!

126
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,358
Hey, listen.

127
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,242
Listen to this.

128
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:46,071
This is Effmann's letter.

129
00:15:47,156 --> 00:15:49,950
The swing parts called swing

130
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:53,162
shall not exceed 20%
of the repertoire.

131
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:54,629
20%!

132
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:56,248
Let's play what, then?

133
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,791
We will not play waltzes.

134
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,258
You will set the pace.

135
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,420
I swear...
And it's not over.

136
00:16:02,046 --> 00:16:04,423
Kick the foot during a solo...

137
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:09,428
Kicking the foot during a
solo is strictly prohibited.

138
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:11,395
It is a provocation.

139
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:15,100
If you are not on this tour,
we will have problems.

140
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:17,102
All non-Aryan instruments,

141
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:19,146
like cow kina...

142
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:22,316
- I'm not joking. Listen.
"He said no, Charles.

143
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:25,576
Cineta de vaca...

144
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:27,613
Wait, there is one for you...

145
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,980
I read that now.

146
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:31,617
The double bass must
be played with the bow

147
00:16:31,784 --> 00:16:33,452
in jazz musics.

148
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:37,790
Read this:
"The cow bell is for..."

149
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:40,959
Give it here, I want to see it.

150
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,882
Oh yes, that's right...

151
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:49,051
very interesting.

152
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,143
Charlie.

153
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:53,521
Stop the jokes...

154
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:55,224
I'm serious.

155
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,726
I'll leave you.

156
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,687
Come on, Charles.

157
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:01,278
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

158
00:17:01,814 --> 00:17:03,415
At the bottom of the pillar to the left.

159
00:17:03,782 --> 00:17:05,125
Good evening.

160
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:06,610
- Good evening, Lucas.
- Django.

161
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:37,433
Are you married?

162
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,899
Do not.

163
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:41,152
Is that you?

164
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:50,411
Are you happy?

165
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:52,238
I have nothing to complain about.

166
00:17:52,581 --> 00:17:55,567
Your German friends are
stretching you the red carpet,

167
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:57,635
is getting involved
with obscure things...

168
00:17:58,412 --> 00:17:59,913
This war is not mine.

169
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:03,667
It's not gypsy war.
We never made a war.

170
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,377
Simple like that, is not it?

171
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:09,263
I'm a musician.
Jazz musician.

172
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:10,883
It's what I do best.

173
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,349
Who will come to hear me,

174
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:14,011
It's not my problem.

175
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:16,096
Is it a hint to me?

176
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,603
As there is no more American jazz,
I became the King of Swing.

177
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,106
People want me and I get them.

178
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,693
You make your monkey
number trained.

179
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,160
Do you think so?

180
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:37,826
Perhaps. But the public
likes and I feed my family.

181
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:42,247
Do not you hear another
song at night in Paris?

182
00:19:19,777 --> 00:19:21,128
Django.

183
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:23,580
You have to see it.
He is dying to laugh.

184
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:26,291
- Come and see.
- Just arrived.

185
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:56,704
Who is this clown?

186
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:58,122
It's Hitler.

187
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:00,033
Oh good...

188
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:03,620
- What a ridiculous mustache.
- Nazi mustache.

189
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,497
Just like yours.

190
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,562
That's the alarm!

191
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:31,398
Naguire, chord.

192
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:33,233
- It's okay.
- Get yourself together.

193
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,444
- I'm coming, Django.
- Get Joko.

194
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:38,238
Comes.
Comes.

195
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:43,792
Lu Plume!
Mommy!

196
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:46,455
Quick.
The alarm rang, we have to leave.

197
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:47,963
Mommy!

198
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,244
We're going to the subway.
You have to wake up.

199
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:55,263
The alarm is ringing, there
will be a plane bomber.

200
00:20:55,271 --> 00:20:57,424
I'm not afraid of bombs.

201
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:59,009
Hurry up.
Let's go.

202
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:00,476
Mam, it's dangerous.

203
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:04,598
Let's go! You do not need a shoe.
Come barefoot.

204
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,106
Calm down, it's okay.

205
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:09,193
Let's go, let's go.

206
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,020
See, Django...

207
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:48,767
- I received from my parents yesterday.
- What is it?

208
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:50,534
- That's a CCO.
- What is it?

209
00:21:50,568 --> 00:21:52,679
Convocation of
compulsory attendance.

210
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:57,234
I have to go to Mr Werner at
the Champs Elysees, number 52

211
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,910
We'll be shipped to Germany.

212
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:01,662
Germany?

213
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,658
We got nothing.

214
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:27,764
A song of love

215
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:31,494
Night

216
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:37,065
Gently in the wind

217
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:39,109
Walking

218
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:42,946
Stop, stop!

219
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:45,657
My ear is not pinico.

220
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,135
You, this is a violin,
not a bagpipe.

221
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:51,747
I touch what is written.
- It does not matter!

222
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:54,499
"Do you have shit in your ears?"
"Not at all.

223
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:55,966
No excuses.

224
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,338
It has to be sweet.

225
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:02,507
Like a beautiful velvet.

226
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:06,386
Do you understand my son?

227
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:11,482
We'll get back to the beginning.

228
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:33,246
Not bad, is it?

229
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,880
Can we record?

230
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,917
Very good idea, is not Django?

231
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:46,968
I have good news.

232
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,305
During his tour in Germany,

233
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:54,017
Goebbels wants to
see you in Berlin.

234
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:58,664
Various concerts on
the biggest stages

235
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:01,608
to keep the morale of the troops
returning from the front.

236
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:04,159
A cache...

237
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:06,988
A very good cache.

238
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:11,493
"Do you know Delphi Palast?"
- Do not.

239
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,960
What about the olfactory state?

240
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:14,545
Neither do they.

241
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,130
Can you imagine?

242
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:19,751
Django Heinardt, the
Gypsy and his Quintet,

243
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:22,546
playing for thousands
of German soldiers.

244
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:26,424
For Goebbels and maybe
even for the FÃ¼hrer.

245
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:47,077
In between.

246
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:50,824
This cousin's house
is so beautiful.

247
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:27,427
Why did you leave?

248
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:31,716
Imitate Clark Gable to me.

249
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:33,433
- No, no.
- Please.

250
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,762
- Stop.
- Please.

251
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:49,150
I am the nightingale who
cries in the night.

252
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:51,361
I am...

253
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:53,947
The gentle breeze in the morning

254
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:56,366
who caresses his charming face.

255
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:58,868
You have a name, do not you?

256
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:00,996
Yes I have a name!

257
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,373
My name is...

258
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:05,583
Django!

259
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:07,919
- I did not like him...
- Oh really?

260
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:09,504
I loved!

261
00:27:23,184 --> 00:27:24,935
Do you know Raymond Weiss?

262
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:27,522
The blind man?
I did not know him.

263
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:30,984
He was shot like a
dog in the Ardennes.

264
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:34,654
- How do you know that?
- I heard.

265
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:38,842
His family was massacred or
sent to where no one knows.

266
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,087
I remember as a child

267
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:53,882
I could hear him sing for hours.

268
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:00,138
In Belgium and the north, people
disappeared without a trace.

269
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:02,189
Django, you must run away.

270
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:04,893
While there is time.

271
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:08,730
I'm safe here.
Doctor Jazz protects me.

272
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:12,067
You are a part that can be
forwarded to the front.

273
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:14,652
Above him is Effmann
and Goebbels.

274
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:16,653
What they are preparing
is abominable.

275
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:18,123
They love me.

276
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:21,618
They want me to go
to give concerts.

277
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,661
Have not you changed your mind?

278
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:27,374
This is crazy.
Will never let you go back.

279
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:43,932
Let's go to the movies
to distract a little?

280
00:29:26,024 --> 00:29:27,324
Oh, Django.

281
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,650
"Are you okay, my dear?"
- Yes and you?

282
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:31,737
Charlie, is he here?

283
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:33,522
Yes, on the phone.
Do you want me to let you know?

284
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:34,934
No, no.

285
00:29:34,936 --> 00:29:37,319
Can you autograph
your last album?

286
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:40,321
I do not know how to write.

287
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:48,371
The rehearsals for Berlin
should be planned.

288
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:50,748
You have never touched
these conditions.

289
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:53,626
The rooms are gigantic.

290
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:56,921
The Folies Bergeres, next door...
Charlie.

291
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,424
The Effmann service
offers 80,000.

292
00:29:59,591 --> 00:30:02,010
It goes no further, but it's good.

293
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:04,971
With Doctor Jazz, we want
2 recording sessions

294
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:07,140
with Deutsche Gramophone.

295
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:10,609
What was this?

296
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:16,774
I was sharpening my razor.
I made a deep cut.

297
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:22,822
I had to immobilize her to heal.

298
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:25,724
Are you kidding me?

299
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:28,126
Do not.

300
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:31,372
It is not possible.

301
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:35,919
It's too late.
Everything is organized.

302
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:38,129
Everything is signed.

303
00:30:48,957 --> 00:30:50,907
"You want my noise?"
- Charlie...

304
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:52,609
I'll be with the
Gestapo on my foot.

305
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:55,079
"It's nothing against you."
- Django, do not do that.

306
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:57,857
If we lose Doctor Jazz's
support, we're dead.

307
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:01,034
The Hot Club is over.

308
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,071
Everything we did
together is over.

309
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,740
I do not like being forced.
I will not go.

310
00:31:06,324 --> 00:31:08,243
What will I tell them?

311
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:11,871
Say that Django wants the
same cache as Clark Gable.

312
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:16,251
Joko, get your violin.

313
00:31:34,694 --> 00:31:36,512
We're looking for Mr. Reinhardt.

314
00:31:36,563 --> 00:31:37,863
Yes, why?

315
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:40,066
"We'd like to see him."
- I am myself.

316
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,910
Django, it's the police.

317
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:09,345
OK.

318
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:12,223
Stand up please.

319
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:15,727
From the front, now.

320
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:23,985
Mr. Reinhardt Jean.

321
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:26,571
Born on January 23, 1910

322
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:28,072
in Liberchies.

323
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:31,034
- Where is this?
- In Belgium.

324
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,500
Are you a nomad?

325
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:35,288
I'm a gypsy.

326
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:36,873
M sico, sir.

327
00:32:42,503 --> 00:32:44,547
17.3

328
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:49,052
Open your mouth.

329
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:51,304
Open more.

330
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:57,275
Yes.

331
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:04,067
6.9

332
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,654
7.4

333
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:12,724
Doctor, can you come
here to see this?

334
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:14,661
Put your hand on the table.

335
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:22,835
It is a congenital degeneration

336
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:24,403
of breeding of inbreeding.

337
00:33:24,504 --> 00:33:25,838
Turn.

338
00:33:28,424 --> 00:33:30,468
This type of relationship
is not natural

339
00:33:30,635 --> 00:33:33,236
generates more fetal formations
with muscular atrophies.

340
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,865
You have a typical case
of Schynzen phocomelias.

341
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:38,726
None of this.

342
00:33:38,893 --> 00:33:40,193
This is a burn.

343
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:44,899
I burned mine in a trailer
with celluloid flowers.

344
00:33:47,485 --> 00:33:48,820
Everybody knows it.

345
00:33:50,105 --> 00:33:51,464
It's all right.

346
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:54,158
You have made your
disability a surpassing one.

347
00:33:55,243 --> 00:33:56,993
You are a virtuous man.

348
00:33:57,286 --> 00:33:58,586
Everybody knows it.

349
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:02,500
Good trip to Germany, Mr.
Reinhardt.

350
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,881
You have two minutes, hurry up.

351
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:19,158
Hello, Black.
I want to talk to the Naguine.

352
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:22,353
She is not here, you miser.
Go away!

353
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,820
Open the door!

354
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:26,065
I have nothing to talk to you.
Go away!

355
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:28,783
Black.

356
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:30,702
Can you hear me?

357
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:33,990
Do not open this door.

358
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:35,891
She has nothing to do here.

359
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,537
- What you want?
- Naguine.

360
00:34:41,205 --> 00:34:43,916
There were many prisoners of gypsies.

361
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:45,918
They are trapped like animals,

362
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:47,962
and if they disobey they
end up being killed

363
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:49,839
or deported to Germany.

364
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:53,134
Women are separated from their
children and sterilized.

365
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:55,762
Babies serve as guinea
pigs for experiments...

366
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:58,055
The Germans love my son.

367
00:34:58,222 --> 00:35:01,309
He will use it as a puppet
to amuse Nazi officials.

368
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:03,102
See how she refers to him.

369
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:04,604
Let her talk.

370
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:06,921
I've spoken to Django,
but he can not hear me.

371
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:08,983
He trusts only you.

372
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,153
You have to persuade him
to go to Switzerland.

373
00:35:13,196 --> 00:35:16,032
- What is it?
- I'll call Thonon fast.

374
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:18,117
There are documents for your family.

375
00:35:18,284 --> 00:35:20,077
and instructions for travel.

376
00:35:20,244 --> 00:35:22,830
My contact name is Rossignol.
He is trustworthy.

377
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:25,124
Why are you helping us?

378
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:28,211
Django is a unique physicist.

379
00:35:28,419 --> 00:35:30,213
He can make beautiful things.

380
00:35:34,383 --> 00:35:36,794
Now you already know everything.
Do whatever you want.

381
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:38,554
Now it's you who will listen to me.

382
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:40,973
Yes, Django is unique.
And he's my man.

383
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:42,565
Forget him.

384
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:46,020
A woman like you can
not make you happy.

385
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:51,658
Good luck.

386
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:57,240
We're in a small
restaurant, me and Django.

387
00:35:57,406 --> 00:36:01,911
The waiter came and
brought a small pot.

388
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,170
With a good niglo.

389
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,630
What is it?

390
00:36:05,832 --> 00:36:07,792
- It's a hedgehog dish.
- Ah...

391
00:36:08,918 --> 00:36:11,796
There was a table with 2
soldiers and 2 Parisians.

392
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:14,298
One of the soldiers stood up.

393
00:36:15,466 --> 00:36:17,426
Sir!
With that accent.

394
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:18,893
Ah, the accent!

395
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:21,764
What are you eating?

396
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:23,641
You look like a mouse.

397
00:36:26,477 --> 00:36:27,777
Django turned and said:

398
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:32,608
Yes sir.
It's a mouse from the Parisian subway.

399
00:36:34,652 --> 00:36:36,237
Do you eat hedgehog?

400
00:36:36,404 --> 00:36:38,489
Yes ma'am.
And it's delicious.

401
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:41,742
"Have you eaten yet?"
- Yes!

402
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,829
- Thank you.
- Naguine.

403
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:47,547
Naguine.

404
00:36:55,298 --> 00:36:57,174
I raise to 100.

405
00:36:58,509 --> 00:37:00,094
150.

406
00:37:04,432 --> 00:37:05,732
300.

407
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:08,818
I'll go to bed.

408
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:11,647
I cover the 300.

409
00:37:12,565 --> 00:37:13,900
Django, you do not have 300.

410
00:37:13,908 --> 00:37:16,408
Lets play roll, I bring
in pr xima round.

411
00:37:16,409 --> 00:37:19,078
We play with the
money on the table.

412
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:22,957
Excuse me.

413
00:37:28,706 --> 00:37:30,541
We're not going to start lending.

414
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,260
Come on, Joko.

415
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,610
Naguine...

416
00:37:53,022 --> 00:37:54,772
What's happening?

417
00:37:56,943 --> 00:37:58,569
We have to leave, Django.

418
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:03,581
I do not like this woman,

419
00:38:03,741 --> 00:38:05,041
but she is right.

420
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:08,454
Why did not you tell
me she came here?

421
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:12,083
And why did not you
tell me she came back?

422
00:38:22,885 --> 00:38:24,428
They gave us a wash.

423
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:28,474
The Feather Snoring...

424
00:38:29,976 --> 00:38:31,811
You have something to tell me.

425
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:36,531
I...

426
00:38:36,816 --> 00:38:38,651
I'm not going with you to Thonon.

427
00:38:40,194 --> 00:38:41,494
Because?

428
00:38:41,696 --> 00:38:42,996
I do not know...

429
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:44,789
There is no way.

430
00:38:45,992 --> 00:38:47,426
You know, I have a wife.

431
00:38:48,077 --> 00:38:49,377
And a boy.

432
00:38:49,495 --> 00:38:51,330
I always followed
where you went.

433
00:38:51,998 --> 00:38:53,298
Ever.

434
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:00,471
How are you going to do it?

435
00:39:00,472 --> 00:39:02,390
I turn around, do not worry.

436
00:39:02,967 --> 00:39:04,385
It's not the end of the world.

437
00:39:05,094 --> 00:39:06,694
I have some things that I wrote.

438
00:39:08,347 --> 00:39:10,349
They offered me a recording.

439
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,650
Concerts.

440
00:39:13,394 --> 00:39:14,694
This is my chance.

441
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:19,191
Mister Soloist wants his light.

442
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,610
Hey, I got my stuff.

443
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:33,838
Nin-nin.

444
00:39:43,758 --> 00:39:45,217
Do not dream too much.

445
00:39:45,468 --> 00:39:46,768
Ah, my brother...

446
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:02,086
"Who is this Rossignol?"
- A painter.

447
00:41:02,253 --> 00:41:04,004
He went to America.

448
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:06,298
Lu's house is empty,
but it has beds.

449
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:08,968
The rooms are upstairs
if you want to see them.

450
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,225
The travel was good?

451
00:41:17,852 --> 00:41:19,152
Do not.

452
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:24,198
Is it Switzerland?

453
00:41:24,233 --> 00:41:25,533
Yes.

454
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:29,864
Why do not we go through?
Some paddles and we're there.

455
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,866
By the lake, it's very risky.

456
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:33,492
It's 13 kilometers.

457
00:41:35,244 --> 00:41:37,496
The Germans took over the
posts of the Italians.

458
00:41:37,663 --> 00:41:39,123
The coast is heavily guarded.

459
00:41:40,124 --> 00:41:42,009
Smugglers are not trustworthy.

460
00:41:42,293 --> 00:41:45,546
They double the combo in the
middle of the crossing.

461
00:41:45,713 --> 00:41:48,140
If they do not have money,
they take him out of the boat.

462
00:41:49,425 --> 00:41:51,575
We find people
drowning every day.

463
00:41:52,386 --> 00:41:53,929
We are lucky,

464
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:55,890
there is a family nearby.

465
00:42:43,229 --> 00:42:45,314
Here's your cousin.

466
00:42:59,161 --> 00:43:00,788
Michto?

467
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,998
Django!

468
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:08,629
Hi, Django.

469
00:43:11,924 --> 00:43:14,093
- Django!
- Oh, no!

470
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:18,180
Oh no, no, no!

471
00:43:27,064 --> 00:43:28,732
I'm happy to see you.

472
00:43:29,858 --> 00:43:31,610
Is your family well?

473
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:29,937
For now, we are waiting
for the Draka family.

474
00:45:30,104 --> 00:45:32,064
They know a safer place,

475
00:45:32,773 --> 00:45:34,441
in the south.

476
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:35,991
When they arrive?

477
00:45:36,026 --> 00:45:37,611
Who knows...

478
00:45:38,153 --> 00:45:40,155
We've been waiting for a month.

479
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:43,200
The problem here

480
00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:45,828
is that we have to pay
for the city hall.

481
00:45:45,994 --> 00:45:47,871
Every week.

482
00:45:48,455 --> 00:45:51,500
The worst is not the
Germans, but the military.

483
00:45:52,626 --> 00:45:54,586
We're not doing more business...

484
00:45:55,087 --> 00:45:57,756
We have no right to
sell the horses.

485
00:45:57,923 --> 00:45:59,223
What do you do then?

486
00:45:59,341 --> 00:46:03,345
At least we can play in a bar.

487
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:05,389
We played some songs.

488
00:46:06,557 --> 00:46:09,143
Would not you like
to play with us?

489
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:11,937
You know, we're just
passing through!

490
00:46:18,694 --> 00:46:19,994
Thank you.

491
00:46:20,863 --> 00:46:22,163
Its sa of.

492
00:46:22,322 --> 00:46:23,824
Sa of.

493
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:32,923
Django!

494
00:46:33,801 --> 00:46:35,143
Here you are.

495
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:36,510
Try it.

496
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,631
Thank you.
So what's the news?

497
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:42,176
We'll have to wait.

498
00:46:45,554 --> 00:46:46,854
It's complicated.

499
00:46:47,055 --> 00:46:48,355
What is complicated?

500
00:46:48,807 --> 00:46:52,611
The leader of the Resistance said
that you are not a priority.

501
00:46:52,703 --> 00:46:54,971
To cross, you have
to wait for Louise.

502
00:46:54,996 --> 00:46:56,338
Do you know where she is?

503
00:46:56,557 --> 00:46:57,916
Not really.

504
00:46:57,983 --> 00:46:59,985
Does that mean no?

505
00:47:03,572 --> 00:47:05,657
There were prisons in Paris.

506
00:47:07,242 --> 00:47:08,542
She was arrested?

507
00:47:08,827 --> 00:47:11,079
I do not know.

508
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:18,086
Did you do a duet
with Louis Armstrong?

509
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:20,380
Does he really have
cracked lipids?

510
00:47:23,383 --> 00:47:25,527
Was it good to play with
Coleman Hawkins on sax?

511
00:47:25,594 --> 00:47:26,894
It was very good, yes.

512
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:28,847
"The Falcon" is his
nickname, is not it?

513
00:47:29,515 --> 00:47:32,326
Before you met, he
won all the duels,

514
00:47:32,392 --> 00:47:34,394
except one, against
Lester Young.

515
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:37,189
"The Kansas City Terror".

516
00:47:38,065 --> 00:47:39,608
How do you know these things?

517
00:47:39,942 --> 00:47:41,242
Are you psychic?

518
00:48:06,176 --> 00:48:08,644
You need to shave your mustache.

519
00:48:08,845 --> 00:48:10,145
How is it?

520
00:48:10,472 --> 00:48:12,558
Not to be recognized.

521
00:48:12,566 --> 00:48:13,992
You're not in your head.

522
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:16,436
- As well? I'm right.
- Stop.

523
00:48:19,231 --> 00:48:20,981
Duke Ellington, how was he?

524
00:48:23,277 --> 00:48:24,577
It was black.

525
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:42,177
Here, my son.

526
00:48:42,671 --> 00:48:43,971
Put them on.

527
00:48:44,715 --> 00:48:46,315
That's all I found.

528
00:48:47,217 --> 00:48:48,918
Without a ticket, everything is very expensive.

529
00:48:49,011 --> 00:48:50,470
- That is all?
- Yes.

530
00:48:53,223 --> 00:48:54,725
We should have stayed in Paris.

531
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:56,435
We had everything there.

532
00:48:56,602 --> 00:48:58,478
And what do we have here?
Anything.

533
00:48:59,479 --> 00:49:02,983
There are evil spirits here.
I am out of here.

534
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:32,471
Do not be so proud.

535
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:42,022
You should play
that bar with them.

536
00:49:49,905 --> 00:49:53,367
We have waited a long time,
and we have nothing to eat.

537
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:04,711
Do not worry about our baby.

538
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:16,181
Do not be afraid.
As long as you have the viol...

539
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:18,684
will be a snake charmer.

540
00:50:21,603 --> 00:50:23,438
No one will dare
touching n s.

541
00:50:25,023 --> 00:50:27,192
I love it, Naguine.

542
00:51:18,702 --> 00:51:20,002
It's not bad, but...

543
00:51:20,162 --> 00:51:22,205
Play faster, it will get better.

544
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:27,127
One two three four.

545
00:51:30,547 --> 00:51:31,847
You will go forward.

546
00:51:45,437 --> 00:51:48,732
Do not look at your fingers.

547
00:51:49,191 --> 00:51:50,692
Come on, play faster.

548
00:51:56,323 --> 00:51:57,824
Sit down, go on.

549
00:51:57,991 --> 00:51:59,291
Come on, go on.

550
00:51:59,292 --> 00:52:00,752
Do not move, stay like this.

551
00:52:00,911 --> 00:52:02,871
That's okay.

552
00:52:04,331 --> 00:52:06,208
Keep playing, Gagar.

553
00:52:06,792 --> 00:52:08,835
So you will forget your fingers.

554
00:52:12,214 --> 00:52:13,514
Do not!

555
00:52:29,815 --> 00:52:31,691
This is my favorite piece.

556
00:52:34,277 --> 00:52:36,279
I like it when it's faster.

557
00:52:45,797 --> 00:52:47,123
Is this me?

558
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:49,000
Yes, you are our hero.

559
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:50,467
No,

560
00:52:51,044 --> 00:52:53,797
I'm a gypsy, like you.

561
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,384
My son is not anyone.

562
00:52:57,551 --> 00:52:59,027
He has already done many concerts.

563
00:52:59,094 --> 00:53:02,430
It has been everywhere.
England, Italy, Spain...

564
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:03,897
It is known everywhere.

565
00:53:03,974 --> 00:53:06,117
Payment proportional to
the clients that come.

566
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:08,436
Are not you Mr. Hoffman?

567
00:53:08,437 --> 00:53:09,972
You're the only ones, not me.

568
00:53:10,188 --> 00:53:12,566
You'll see her crowded
bar, believe me.

569
00:53:12,816 --> 00:53:15,068
You can not buy a
lion with a foot.

570
00:53:15,452 --> 00:53:16,752
We will see.

571
00:53:16,753 --> 00:53:19,089
Make an effort, you
will not regret it.

572
00:53:19,155 --> 00:53:20,740
I can not do more than that.

573
00:53:20,991 --> 00:53:22,291
Mama.

574
00:53:22,617 --> 00:53:24,202
Stop. That does not help.

575
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:26,746
Show him, for this sausage.

576
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:31,793
- What did you say?
"That's a secret between us.

577
00:54:03,742 --> 00:54:05,042
So?

578
00:54:05,702 --> 00:54:07,002
What do you think?

579
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:08,670
We can fit it.

580
00:54:08,705 --> 00:54:10,005
You will not regret it.

581
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:11,750
But first, sign here.

582
00:54:11,917 --> 00:54:13,217
What is it?

583
00:54:13,251 --> 00:54:16,087
- That's the law.
- I can not read or write.

584
00:54:16,254 --> 00:54:18,304
That certifies that
you are not Jews.

585
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,560
How much will you pay?

586
00:54:23,803 --> 00:54:25,103
50 francs.

587
00:54:25,847 --> 00:54:28,148
The rest will be paid
with the tickets.

588
00:54:28,934 --> 00:54:30,684
Give me something to drink.

589
00:54:34,564 --> 00:54:35,864
Is he of good heart?

590
00:54:35,982 --> 00:54:37,283
She's terrible!

591
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:39,377
Come on, come on, music!

592
00:56:25,675 --> 00:56:27,010
Joko!

593
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:38,070
Joko!

594
00:57:33,618 --> 00:57:36,204
What are you doing here?
Let's go!

595
00:57:36,371 --> 00:57:38,081
What's happening?

596
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:42,669
The house was ordered.
You go away.

597
00:57:44,379 --> 00:57:45,679
Get out of here!

598
00:57:50,426 --> 00:57:52,679
We did not do anything!

599
00:57:54,097 --> 00:57:56,724
Get down!
Faster, please.

600
00:58:24,294 --> 00:58:25,594
Your documents.

601
00:58:35,096 --> 00:58:36,396
Lieutenant.

602
00:59:17,222 --> 00:59:19,564
Thanks.
I'll do it myself.

603
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,445
Did you feel it?

604
00:59:35,073 --> 00:59:36,866
Our son will be a tiger.

605
00:59:37,492 --> 00:59:39,327
Or a tigress!

606
01:00:47,145 --> 01:00:48,445
Good Morning.

607
01:00:52,358 --> 01:00:53,658
Good Morning.

608
01:00:54,819 --> 01:00:56,119
Are you okay?

609
01:01:01,242 --> 01:01:02,542
Do you like to fish?

610
01:01:08,124 --> 01:01:09,542
It is well, my son.

611
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:13,720
Yes, my father.

612
01:01:34,776 --> 01:01:37,362
The radar was repaired
shortly before the war.

613
01:01:38,654 --> 01:01:40,073
The sound is magnificent.

614
01:01:47,622 --> 01:01:50,708
You do not think I'm going
to play during your sermons.

615
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:53,009
I do not believe it at all.

616
01:01:53,086 --> 01:01:54,636
They are superstitions.

617
01:01:54,796 --> 01:01:56,096
That's not it.

618
01:01:56,798 --> 01:02:00,134
I thought you'd be at
peace here to write.

619
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:06,557
Who told you I was writing?

620
01:02:51,769 --> 01:02:53,604
Oh, there's you, the sparrow.

621
01:02:55,773 --> 01:02:58,276
I told you to be
discreet, with...

622
01:02:58,443 --> 01:02:59,902
Where is she in Switzerland?

623
01:03:00,069 --> 01:03:01,904
- But...
- Where is she?

624
01:03:03,531 --> 01:03:05,241
I depend on you to cross.

625
01:04:59,814 --> 01:05:01,774
Do you wanna Dance?

626
01:05:01,941 --> 01:05:03,651
- No, thank you.
- Get out of here.

627
01:05:03,776 --> 01:05:05,076
Get out!

628
01:05:50,531 --> 01:05:51,831
Are you still here?

629
01:05:52,867 --> 01:05:54,167
The documents.

630
01:05:58,581 --> 01:05:59,881
Take the.

631
01:06:23,356 --> 01:06:24,857
Where are we going?

632
01:06:56,472 --> 01:06:59,642
Mr. Reinhardt.
Come in, please.

633
01:07:03,104 --> 01:07:07,108
Your talent is precious, but
if you are in the wrong hands,

634
01:07:07,274 --> 01:07:08,859
can sow violence

635
01:07:09,026 --> 01:07:10,361
and clutter.

636
01:07:11,821 --> 01:07:15,032
- I just play music.
"Do not be innocent.

637
01:07:15,241 --> 01:07:16,617
You are not.

638
01:07:18,536 --> 01:07:20,413
Ah, Mrs De Klerk.

639
01:07:20,913 --> 01:07:22,665
Come in, please.

640
01:07:25,251 --> 01:07:27,995
I think it's unnecessary to make
the presentations, is not it?

641
01:07:27,996 --> 01:07:29,748
It is not necessary.

642
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,180
Hi, Django.

643
01:07:32,049 --> 01:07:34,009
You are being
awaited in Germany.

644
01:07:34,176 --> 01:07:36,178
Did you forget that?

645
01:07:36,387 --> 01:07:39,348
The Staffel Propaganda
and the Embassy in Paris

646
01:07:39,515 --> 01:07:41,842
they reported me
their disappearance

647
01:07:41,844 --> 01:07:43,937
when everything was
ready for the tour.

648
01:07:46,355 --> 01:07:47,982
What are you doing in Thonon?

649
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:52,486
Do not tell me you want
to cross to Switzerland?

650
01:07:53,279 --> 01:07:54,579
Do not.

651
01:07:57,074 --> 01:07:58,374
AND...

652
01:07:58,576 --> 01:08:00,578
Prior to his departure for Berlin,

653
01:08:00,745 --> 01:08:03,998
I would like you to
do a show for us.

654
01:08:06,542 --> 01:08:10,045
In the next week,
officials from the region

655
01:08:10,212 --> 01:08:12,757
will meet in the Amphion village.

656
01:08:12,923 --> 01:08:17,261
A beautiful place where Mrs.
De Klerk and I live.

657
01:08:17,636 --> 01:08:20,222
Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz
are our guests.

658
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:23,158
Our officers are far
from their families.

659
01:08:23,159 --> 01:08:25,209
and this is the
opportunity to offer them

660
01:08:25,227 --> 01:08:26,979
a moment of relaxation.

661
01:08:27,772 --> 01:08:30,941
We also appreciate your music,

662
01:08:31,108 --> 01:08:33,903
provided they do not pass the measure.

663
01:08:34,069 --> 01:08:37,198
Django knows the rules
of advertising.

664
01:08:37,364 --> 01:08:39,617
He had already applied them in Paris.

665
01:08:40,409 --> 01:08:44,413
Lucky for you being
such a devotee.

666
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:46,540
Louise insisted

667
01:08:46,707 --> 01:08:48,709
to invite him to be among us.

668
01:08:50,211 --> 01:08:53,339
This is an opportunity to redeem
yourself from your conduct.

669
01:08:53,506 --> 01:08:55,299
But it will be on the ground.

670
01:08:55,633 --> 01:08:57,593
At the slightest slip,

671
01:08:57,885 --> 01:09:00,805
we will be forced to break
your other fingers.

672
01:09:01,931 --> 01:09:03,231
Hammerstein!

673
01:09:09,063 --> 01:09:11,148
Take this gentleman.

674
01:09:11,357 --> 01:09:12,657
Come here.

675
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:14,450
Lieutenant.

676
01:09:14,819 --> 01:09:16,445
In Amphion, you will be

677
01:09:16,612 --> 01:09:19,406
the person responsible
for artistic purity.

678
01:09:19,573 --> 01:09:21,367
No false note will be tolerated.

679
01:09:25,496 --> 01:09:28,290
Come on.
"I have one last favor to ask."

680
01:09:29,467 --> 01:09:31,228
Let him join your family.

681
01:09:31,252 --> 01:09:34,713
A dungeon is not the most
appropriate place to rehearse.

682
01:09:36,549 --> 01:09:37,849
Louise...

683
01:09:38,926 --> 01:09:41,095
Who will ensure that your

684
01:09:41,262 --> 01:09:44,598
protected will not you run away?

685
01:09:46,308 --> 01:09:47,768
I guarantee.

686
01:09:49,854 --> 01:09:51,154
Django!

687
01:09:52,064 --> 01:09:53,364
Django!

688
01:09:57,052 --> 01:09:58,352
Django, wait!

689
01:09:58,362 --> 01:10:00,212
"What circus is that?"
- Calm down.

690
01:10:00,322 --> 01:10:02,424
You should take us
to Switzerland.

691
01:10:02,426 --> 01:10:05,035
Do not yell.
Do not yell.

692
01:10:05,202 --> 01:10:07,746
It's been two months
I've been hiding here.

693
01:10:07,913 --> 01:10:11,166
Did you tell me about the Germans
so I could make a concert?

694
01:10:12,668 --> 01:10:14,420
You're still a ego.

695
01:10:14,587 --> 01:10:17,022
You did not worry about
what happened to me.

696
01:10:17,089 --> 01:10:18,790
You should be happy to see me.

697
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:22,261
You're the only person that
the war has not changed.

698
01:10:24,013 --> 01:10:25,313
Louise!

699
01:11:05,554 --> 01:11:07,973
I was arrested soon
after you left Paris.

700
01:11:09,016 --> 01:11:11,016
They interrogated me for a week.

701
01:11:13,395 --> 01:11:15,439
They were not kind to me.

702
01:11:19,902 --> 01:11:21,202
What they did?

703
01:11:21,278 --> 01:11:22,578
I can not tell you more.

704
01:11:22,579 --> 01:11:23,879
- Say it.
- No, no.

705
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:26,341
- Tell me.
"Believe me, it will be better this way.

706
01:11:30,913 --> 01:11:32,331
Are you with them now?

707
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:37,760
What question!

708
01:11:43,509 --> 01:11:46,971
Huns Biber allowed me
to bring his musicians.

709
01:11:47,137 --> 01:11:48,737
You have to do this concert.

710
01:11:48,738 --> 01:11:50,606
- This is important.
- Because?

711
01:11:51,725 --> 01:11:54,351
- We must obey.
"I'll never play for them."

712
01:11:54,386 --> 01:11:55,721
You have no choice!

713
01:11:58,232 --> 01:11:59,532
They killed my monkey.

714
01:12:01,193 --> 01:12:02,653
Is that serious?

715
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:17,918
Please silence.

716
01:12:19,628 --> 01:12:20,928
Silence!

717
01:12:21,005 --> 01:12:22,923
Notice from Feldkommandanfur.

718
01:12:23,507 --> 01:12:26,385
Thonon-les-Bains,
November 9, 1943.

719
01:12:27,428 --> 01:12:28,887
Since today,

720
01:12:29,513 --> 01:12:31,473
the nomads of the Field of the Crest

721
01:12:31,765 --> 01:12:34,852
are prohibited from
leaving your facility

722
01:12:35,019 --> 01:12:38,147
and travel on public roads
and make campfires.

723
01:12:38,313 --> 01:12:39,998
You are under house arrest.

724
01:12:40,065 --> 01:12:42,192
The violation of this decree

725
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:44,403
will result in imprisonment.

726
01:12:44,903 --> 01:12:47,114
Ladr is!

727
01:13:04,423 --> 01:13:06,884
I'll break the
first one's mouth!

728
01:13:07,051 --> 01:13:08,427
I'll split the head!

729
01:13:14,349 --> 01:13:15,893
Come on, Mommy.

730
01:14:50,529 --> 01:14:52,239
"Are not you coming with us?"
- Do not.

731
01:15:39,494 --> 01:15:41,288
- Django.
"How are you?"

732
01:15:41,355 --> 01:15:42,655
I am fine.

733
01:15:42,689 --> 01:15:44,490
I missed you, you thugs.

734
01:15:45,259 --> 01:15:47,294
"Where is Joseph?"
"You did not know?"

735
01:15:48,295 --> 01:15:50,255
He fled to hide in Toulon.

736
01:15:50,422 --> 01:15:51,722
Since when?

737
01:15:51,882 --> 01:15:53,182
There will be a month.

738
01:15:54,718 --> 01:15:56,386
He is smart.

739
01:15:56,929 --> 01:15:58,229
He found his place in the sun.

740
01:16:03,435 --> 01:16:05,729
Did Louise tell you
Charles was arrested?

741
01:16:07,022 --> 01:16:08,472
- Do not.
- They arrested him.

742
01:16:08,607 --> 01:16:10,108
Doctor Jazz released him.

743
01:16:10,275 --> 01:16:12,236
But we never saw his
secretary again.

744
01:16:12,402 --> 01:16:14,503
Beware of Louise.
It is not clean.

745
01:16:14,696 --> 01:16:16,196
Made us play for them.

746
01:16:17,157 --> 01:16:19,326
She said she denounced Charles.

747
01:16:49,606 --> 01:16:51,191
It's the ropes.

748
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:01,827
And then the choir comes in.

749
01:17:04,788 --> 01:17:06,581
How many micos are you imagining?

750
01:17:07,708 --> 01:17:09,459
Write down, Plume, write down.

751
01:17:24,558 --> 01:17:27,436
My whole family
had been removed.

752
01:17:28,854 --> 01:17:32,399
My son and I escaped.

753
01:17:32,774 --> 01:17:36,028
And my nephew Bakro

754
01:17:36,445 --> 01:17:39,698
was killed by the German guards.

755
01:17:39,948 --> 01:17:41,366
It's Renardo.

756
01:17:41,533 --> 01:17:43,660
One of the children of the Draka family.

757
01:17:44,661 --> 01:17:47,681
His family was trapped in
a camp in Arc-et-Senans.

758
01:17:47,873 --> 01:17:51,209
They separated the families in the countryside.

759
01:17:52,336 --> 01:17:54,254
It was terrifying.

760
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:56,882
A lot of suffering.

761
01:17:58,467 --> 01:18:03,055
The men's field is
surrounded with barbed wire.

762
01:18:03,638 --> 01:18:06,308
There was death every day.

763
01:18:07,517 --> 01:18:09,519
We were treated like animals.

764
01:18:10,312 --> 01:18:12,689
Even by the French gendarmes.

765
01:18:14,483 --> 01:18:17,569
I came back to warn them.

766
01:18:18,403 --> 01:18:22,866
Everyone who got on the
trains disappeared.

767
01:18:23,325 --> 01:18:26,161
They are the real demons.

768
01:18:27,245 --> 01:18:28,545
I beg of you,

769
01:18:29,164 --> 01:18:30,499
save yourself all !.

770
01:18:30,916 --> 01:18:32,216
Do not stay here.

771
01:18:32,584 --> 01:18:34,669
He is tired, he has to rest.

772
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:37,172
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

773
01:19:18,046 --> 01:19:19,382
It's all up to you.

774
01:19:19,384 --> 01:19:21,442
Their ability to distract them.

775
01:19:23,385 --> 01:19:26,513
- Who will it be?
"Les Boches, at Villa Amphion.

776
01:19:26,763 --> 01:19:29,850
"Louise spoke to you?"
- I need an airman.

777
01:19:30,016 --> 01:19:33,019
He is wounded and can
not cross the mountain.

778
01:19:33,645 --> 01:19:35,845
We will cross the lake
during your concert.

779
01:19:38,108 --> 01:19:40,610
You've been fooling me for months.

780
01:19:41,862 --> 01:19:44,213
I'm waiting, waiting
with my family.

781
01:19:44,215 --> 01:19:45,992
And the time of departure never comes.

782
01:19:46,158 --> 01:19:48,577
When we were brutalized
at the camp,

783
01:19:48,743 --> 01:19:50,805
stole carts, horses...

784
01:19:50,829 --> 01:19:52,289
And you did not do anything.

785
01:19:52,622 --> 01:19:55,717
And do I have to touch so that
someone runs in my place?

786
01:19:55,718 --> 01:19:57,668
You are guaranteed your
passage to Switzerland.

787
01:19:57,669 --> 01:19:59,838
I do not want to know more
about your guarantees!

788
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:01,798
I do not believe your
promises anymore!

789
01:20:02,883 --> 01:20:04,826
I can not touch, my hands hurt.

790
01:20:04,993 --> 01:20:06,353
Are you hurt?

791
01:20:06,355 --> 01:20:08,214
I have barbs under
my fingernails.

792
01:20:08,388 --> 01:20:09,688
Give it your way.

793
01:20:21,526 --> 01:20:23,445
I will play with a condition.

794
01:20:25,071 --> 01:20:27,432
You must protect the
families of the camp.

795
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:31,953
"We will do what we can.
- No, look me in the eyes.

796
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:33,420
I want your word.

797
01:20:35,207 --> 01:20:36,507
For you,

798
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:39,085
his wife, mother and his parents.

799
01:20:39,586 --> 01:20:40,886
You did it.

800
01:20:40,887 --> 01:20:43,181
As for the others, I can
not promise you anything.

801
01:20:43,189 --> 01:20:46,092
We can take care of those who
are linked to the Resistance.

802
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:50,680
- It's fine.
"What about the others?"

803
01:20:51,973 --> 01:20:53,850
Women, children and the elderly?

804
01:21:00,982 --> 01:21:02,484
Son of a bitch!

805
01:21:50,657 --> 01:21:51,957
Django!

806
01:21:52,367 --> 01:21:53,667
Come on!

807
01:21:57,998 --> 01:22:00,340
"Is that settled?"
- Yes, Django.

808
01:22:00,801 --> 01:22:02,451
It will bring the members
of the Resistance.

809
01:22:02,552 --> 01:22:03,852
They are young.

810
01:22:03,853 --> 01:22:05,153
Son of a bitch.

811
01:22:06,381 --> 01:22:08,341
Wherever we go, we
do not need it.

812
01:22:08,508 --> 01:22:11,511
You're crazy, stay with him.
That will give you luck.

813
01:22:12,053 --> 01:22:13,353
Thank you.

814
01:22:41,583 --> 01:22:43,126
We have to go.

815
01:23:21,206 --> 01:23:24,417
Do not worry dear

816
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:46,840
Good morning gentlemen.

817
01:24:50,670 --> 01:24:51,970
You must change.

818
01:24:52,964 --> 01:24:55,258
You will be here waiting.

819
01:25:41,930 --> 01:25:43,723
What are you going to play?

820
01:25:46,935 --> 01:25:48,978
Well, we do not plan

821
01:25:49,562 --> 01:25:52,232
"Manoir de mes rÃªves".
"Nuages".

822
01:25:52,398 --> 01:25:54,901
You guys should play
bass during dinner.

823
01:25:56,277 --> 01:25:58,363
so as not to disturb
the conversations.

824
01:25:59,906 --> 01:26:02,158
Preferably the big harmonies.

825
01:26:02,909 --> 01:26:04,327
Nothing Blues.

826
01:26:05,328 --> 01:26:07,330
Breaks are forbidden.

827
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:11,292
And avoid the most
joyful and fast rhythms.

828
01:26:12,126 --> 01:26:14,546
Not more than 5% of scope.

829
01:26:16,256 --> 01:26:18,842
Soils should not last
longer than 5 seconds.

830
01:26:19,008 --> 01:26:20,308
Ah yes.

831
01:26:37,569 --> 01:26:38,969
Do you know music?

832
01:26:40,530 --> 01:26:41,830
Do not.

833
01:26:42,866 --> 01:26:44,284
But she knows me.

834
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:47,460
Where are you going?

835
01:26:47,495 --> 01:26:50,088
In three minutes, be on stage.

836
01:26:52,959 --> 01:26:54,259
Was I clear?

837
01:27:56,648 --> 01:27:57,974
Have you tuned it?

838
01:27:57,975 --> 01:27:59,275
Yes.

839
01:28:13,081 --> 01:28:15,083
Tonight, ring for me, please.

840
01:28:16,834 --> 01:28:19,837
- On here?
- No, far from here.

841
01:29:01,963 --> 01:29:03,339
Stop, stop.

842
01:29:03,965 --> 01:29:05,675
Dear friends

843
01:29:05,842 --> 01:29:09,262
I am very pleased to
welcome you here today.

844
01:29:09,429 --> 01:29:11,014
Would like to thank

845
01:29:11,222 --> 01:29:13,433
General of the Huber Division,

846
01:29:14,225 --> 01:29:15,935
who came from Annemasse.

847
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:18,589
I would like to thank
Mr and Mrs Schwartz

848
01:29:18,591 --> 01:29:21,358
for their hospitality.

849
01:29:22,275 --> 01:29:26,029
I confess that this
landscape, this lake

850
01:29:26,195 --> 01:29:29,991
much reminds me of our
beloved Chiemsee.

851
01:29:30,283 --> 01:29:34,287
We do not deserve a bit of fun.

852
01:29:34,454 --> 01:29:37,248
As the poet Friedrich
RÃ¼ckert says:

853
01:29:37,415 --> 01:29:39,751
"Do not ask what fate

854
01:29:40,501 --> 01:29:42,795
I'll book you for tomorrow,

855
01:29:43,212 --> 01:29:44,964
the gift belongs to us

856
01:29:45,131 --> 01:29:47,091
to taste it "

857
01:29:47,550 --> 01:29:49,260
For a free Europe!

858
01:29:49,427 --> 01:29:50,727
A German Europe!

859
01:29:50,887 --> 01:29:52,346
Long live the FÃ¼hrer!

860
01:30:26,005 --> 01:30:28,132
Now tell me everything.

861
01:30:28,883 --> 01:30:30,301
About what matter?

862
01:30:31,135 --> 01:30:33,638
You and that... degenerate.

863
01:30:34,138 --> 01:30:35,890
How was it possible?

864
01:30:46,818 --> 01:30:49,070
My first love was a
Russian painter.

865
01:30:50,029 --> 01:30:53,116
A great melancholy who
found life unbearable.

866
01:30:54,367 --> 01:30:56,077
My support was of no use.

867
01:30:58,079 --> 01:31:00,623
He committed suicide shortly
after our engagement.

868
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:05,586
I went out every night

869
01:31:06,337 --> 01:31:07,922
to get drunk on music.

870
01:31:08,214 --> 01:31:09,514
And dance.

871
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:13,302
It was at that time
that I met Django.

872
01:31:14,053 --> 01:31:15,429
He was gorgeous.

873
01:31:17,890 --> 01:31:19,684
With him, I forgot my suffering.

874
01:31:24,188 --> 01:31:25,488
Listen how beautiful it is.

875
01:31:51,507 --> 01:31:53,551
- That's a Blues.
- Do not.

876
01:31:59,557 --> 01:32:00,857
Are you bored?

877
01:32:00,858 --> 01:32:02,818
Do not. Not with you.
Never.

878
01:32:07,023 --> 01:32:09,275
- I want to dance.
- Ah yes?

879
01:32:09,442 --> 01:32:11,485
- I can...
"You'll be next."

880
01:32:18,534 --> 01:32:20,369
Official!

881
01:32:20,703 --> 01:32:22,003
- No...
- Please.

882
01:32:22,096 --> 01:32:23,396
No, but...

883
01:32:54,487 --> 01:32:56,948
We have to stop them.

884
01:32:58,366 --> 01:33:01,953
We must put an end to their actions.

885
01:33:22,556 --> 01:33:24,225
- Do you allow me?
- With pleasure.

886
01:33:24,392 --> 01:33:25,692
I wanted to dance.

887
01:36:25,573 --> 01:36:27,867
This monkey monkey
makes people crazy!

888
01:36:29,285 --> 01:36:31,537
Stop this concert right now!

889
01:36:33,372 --> 01:36:34,672
Stop the music.

890
01:36:38,085 --> 01:36:39,385
Stop the music!

891
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:42,680
Hammerstein!

892
01:36:43,132 --> 01:36:44,432
Get them out of here!

893
01:36:48,846 --> 01:36:50,146
Quick!

894
01:37:02,985 --> 01:37:04,285
Come here.

895
01:37:08,824 --> 01:37:10,409
Thanks, Django.

896
01:37:11,243 --> 01:37:12,543
Thank you.

897
01:37:17,208 --> 01:37:18,918
- I'm afraid.
- Do not.

898
01:37:19,543 --> 01:37:20,843
Do not worry.

899
01:37:20,878 --> 01:37:22,630
Rossignol has the instructions.

900
01:37:23,214 --> 01:37:24,514
I fear for you.

901
01:37:27,301 --> 01:37:29,261
You changed, yes,
I was mistaken.

902
01:37:32,306 --> 01:37:33,641
Let's see each other again?

903
01:37:33,807 --> 01:37:35,559
Yes for sure.

904
01:37:35,726 --> 01:37:38,011
I juice, then I come
back, I juice again...

905
01:37:38,395 --> 01:37:39,695
Like Java.

906
01:37:41,982 --> 01:37:43,282
Open it!

907
01:37:46,946 --> 01:37:48,246
Get out!

908
01:37:51,825 --> 01:37:54,495
Django, I'll see you in Pigalle.

909
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:16,350
Colonel, your phone
line was cut off.

910
01:38:22,273 --> 01:38:23,573
What's happening?

911
01:38:23,649 --> 01:38:26,569
Members of the Resistance
detonated a German train.

912
01:38:26,735 --> 01:38:28,035
What?

913
01:38:29,488 --> 01:38:31,581
- When was that?
- It's 40 minutes.

914
01:38:31,699 --> 01:38:34,868
Trains derailed.
The damage was heavy.

915
01:38:38,831 --> 01:38:40,131
Where were you, darling?

916
01:38:42,876 --> 01:38:44,177
Let me go!

917
01:38:44,244 --> 01:38:45,544
Let me go!

918
01:38:45,546 --> 01:38:46,846
Let me go.

919
01:38:50,718 --> 01:38:52,018
It's a shame.

920
01:38:53,095 --> 01:38:54,930
You danced very well.

921
01:39:32,176 --> 01:39:33,844
Get away from Django!

922
01:39:45,814 --> 01:39:47,566
Burn it all!

923
01:39:59,328 --> 01:40:00,628
Reinhardt!

924
01:40:16,679 --> 01:40:18,129
What are you doing?

925
01:40:18,597 --> 01:40:20,099
Come on, quick!

926
01:40:20,307 --> 01:40:21,607
Come on!

927
01:41:21,702 --> 01:41:23,502
Switzerland is behind the mountain.

928
01:41:29,418 --> 01:41:31,219
I have no more strength.

929
01:41:31,336 --> 01:41:32,921
I will never get there until l.

930
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:46,435
Come here and help me.

931
01:41:53,358 --> 01:41:56,111
"They're going up, they will not."
- Some problem?

932
01:41:56,820 --> 01:41:58,155
She is not wrong.

933
01:41:58,322 --> 01:41:59,656
They will not.

934
01:41:59,823 --> 01:42:01,617
I'm very tired.

935
01:42:01,784 --> 01:42:03,285
Negros is exhausted.

936
01:42:06,580 --> 01:42:08,123
Can you hide them?

937
01:42:08,332 --> 01:42:09,917
We can not.

938
01:42:10,083 --> 01:42:11,383
You're almost there.

939
01:42:11,502 --> 01:42:13,295
If they catch you,
they'll kill you.

940
01:42:13,962 --> 01:42:15,631
Rossignol will take care of us.

941
01:42:15,798 --> 01:42:17,758
Let's find Joseph in Toulon.

942
01:42:19,218 --> 01:42:20,518
Are you sure?

943
01:42:28,852 --> 01:42:30,229
Forgive me.

944
01:42:34,858 --> 01:42:36,276
Come on, Django!

945
01:43:21,638 --> 01:43:22,938
Hang on!

946
01:43:22,990 --> 01:43:24,533
- What?
- Listen!

947
01:43:29,913 --> 01:43:31,623
They are c Ã£ s!

948
01:43:36,628 --> 01:43:37,928
It's a patrol.

949
01:43:42,175 --> 01:43:44,361
- We have to separate.
- Wait a minute.

950
01:43:44,887 --> 01:43:46,237
It's our only chance.

951
01:43:47,006 --> 01:43:48,706
"You keep going up."
- Hang on.

952
01:43:48,724 --> 01:43:50,392
Cross the forest.

953
01:43:50,559 --> 01:43:52,510
When you reach the end, you
will be in Switzerland.

954
01:43:52,511 --> 01:43:55,063
- Good luck.
- Hang on!

955
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:31,500
The "Gypsy Brothers Requiem"

956
01:51:31,501 --> 01:51:34,466
was carried out only once
during the Liberation of France

957
01:51:34,467 --> 01:51:37,066
in the chapel of the National
Institute of the Blind in Paris.

958
01:51:37,067 --> 01:51:39,788
Django Heinardt dedicated
his piece to all Gypsies

959
01:51:39,790 --> 01:51:42,668
persecuted during the 2nd
World War in Europe.

960
01:51:42,669 --> 01:51:45,496
The score was lost.
There are only a few excerpts.
