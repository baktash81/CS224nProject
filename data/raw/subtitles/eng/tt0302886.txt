Real Estate Query Engine

3
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,200
is a virtual rubicon of information,

4
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,600
putting the lawyer himself
at the controls.

5
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,000
Listen, I'm going to take off, okay?
I'm gonna try and catch the 2:00 back.

6
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,400
You're leaving the seminar now?
It's not even intermission.

7
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,000
- I don't think you can do that.
- No, it's fine. Just cover for me, okay?

8
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,400
- Get it all.
- I guess.

9
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,200
- Listen, could we have your badge?
- Yeah.

10
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,200
It's worth two free drinks
at the Meet and Greet.

11
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,400
Hello.

12
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,600
I'm going to the airport.
I'm kind of in a hurry, too.

13
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,100
Sir, your seat belt
seems to be broken.

14
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,900
What do you recommend I do?

15
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,500
I recommend you stop being such a faggot.

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You're in the back seat.

17
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,800
Jesus.

18
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,900
See?

19
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,700
Hello?

20
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,100
Hey, boy.

21
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,900
Good boy, Orson.
Where's Mommy?

22
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,600
Honey?

23
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,200
Heidi?

24
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,200
Heidi?

25
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,900
Mitch!

26
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,900
What are you doing home?
You totally scared me!

27
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,500
I scared you?
Because for a second, I thought...

28
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,200
I don't even want to say it.

29
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,500
Wow.

30
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,600
That's, like, pretty hard-core.

31
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,400
Yeah, I know.

32
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,900
No, I'm not judging.
Don't be embarrassed.

33
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,100
This is a major turn-on.
Let's go with this.

34
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,500
- Is this what you do when I'm gone?
- Mitch, wait.

35
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,500
No, I mean, I do it myself every once
in a while, but to magazines.

36
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,500
Okay, Mitch, we need to talk.

37
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,100
- Hello!
- Aah!

38
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,200
Be honest.

39
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,300
Please tell me this is the first time
this has happened.

40
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,400
Well, do you want me to be honest, or you
want me to tell you this is the first time?

41
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,400
- Jesus, what is wrong with you?
- Nothing is wrong with me!

42
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,400
I've tried to tell you about this.

43
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,400
What? When?

44
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,700
- All the time!
- Like when?

45
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,900
- Like, when we're in bed and stuff.
- In bed?

46
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,500
I thought you were just talking dirty.

47
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,800
I was, but I was being serious.

48
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,000
You've said some really sick stuff.

49
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,400
You have to admit it,

50
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,000
we haven't exactly been living the most
exciting lives in the world.

51
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,600
This is a totally different kind
of satisfaction for me.

52
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,300
It's purely sexual.

53
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,400
Ooh!

54
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,400
I'm really sorry.

55
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,000
Hello.

56
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,500
Yeah?

57
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,600
I'm here for the gang bang.

58
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,900
You look a little pale, Mitch.
You need to breathe.

59
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,200
Let a little blood up in your face there,
will ya?

60
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,300
- I don't want to breathe.
- You should be proud of yourself.

61
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,100
Do you have any idea how hard it is to land
a girl as sexually enlightened as Heidi is?

62
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,000
A girl like that comes around, what,
once every hundred years?

63
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,300
I wasn't looking for a girl like that.

64
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,500
Columbus wasn't looking for America,
but that seemed to work out for everybody.

65
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,400
You're here.
You know what I mean?

66
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,000
Hey, I just want to thank you
one last time for being here.

67
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,700
It's the best day ever.

68
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,400
Don't even start with me, Franklin, okay?
You need to walk away from this ASAP.

69
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,100
- What?
- You need to get out, Frankie.

70
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,600
This is it. It's now or never. You need
to get out of here while you're still single.

71
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,700
- I'm not single.
- She's 30 yards away, you're single now.

72
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,600
Come on, Marissa's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

73
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,200
Why don't you give that six months.
You don't think that'll change?

74
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,300
I got a wife, kids.

75
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,200
Do I seem like a happy guy to you,
Frankie?

76
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,200
There's my wife. See that?

77
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,300
Always smiling? Hi, honey.
Judging, watching, "Look at the baby."

78
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,000
She's coming down the aisle, Beanie.
Let it go.

79
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,800
Let me be the first to say
congratulations to you then.

80
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,700
You get one vagina the rest of your life.
Real smart. Way to work it through.

81
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,200
- Don't listen to him.
- I need my inhaler.

82
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,000
It takes a man to give away an angel.
You're a sweetheart.

83
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,100
You look beautiful.

84
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,500
Great.

85
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,200
Dearly beloved,

86
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,400
we are gathered here together

87
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,100
to join Franklin and Marissa...

88
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,500
Don't do it!

89
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,500
My throat is dry.
I'm sorry.

90
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,400
I'm a smoker.

91
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,300
Okay.

92
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,000
Mitch Martin?

93
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah.

94
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,400
Nicole!

95
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,200
My God!

96
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,500
This is crazy!

97
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,900
I can't believe it's you!

98
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,500
God.

99
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,200
- What are you doing here?
- I was invited.

100
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:29,000
The last time that I had heard,
you had moved to...

101
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,900
- What do you call it?
- Denver.

102
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
The Sunshine State.

103
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,800
Denver!

104
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,300
Gorgeous!
Gorgeous!

105
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,500
Oh, boy.

106
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,000
Are you okay?

107
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,400
No, I'm...

108
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,100
Yeah, I just feel a little...

109
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,700
fucked up.

110
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,700
Yeah, Marissa told me about your
girlfriend. I'm very sorry.

111
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,100
The thing about that one is,
is it's not just that.

112
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,500
It's a combination of things.

113
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,300
We had a dog,
we had a great place,

114
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,300
but all just...

115
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,600
You know what?
I think you should have some of this.

116
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,200
- What's in this one?
- Coffee.

117
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,800
Ow! Oww! Jesus!

118
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,500
- I am so sorry! Please, just...
- No, don't touch!

119
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,100
- I can fix it. Just...
- Mitch, really.

120
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,800
- No, Mitch!
- What are you doing to this poor girl?

121
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,300
Mitch, stop it!
I got it.

122
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,900
No. lnappropriate.
Stop it right now.

123
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
- Sweetie, there's a bathroom over here.
- Thank you.

124
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,400
Mitch, honey? Hon?

125
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
Why don't you go get some air, okay?
Walk it off.

126
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,400
No, wait a second.

127
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,000
Yeah?

128
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,100
- Put in a good word for me.
- Yeah, okay.

129
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,500
Hey, Marissa!

130
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,500
You're the lady.

131
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,500
Can't hear you!

132
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,700
Excuse me.

133
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,800
I'd like to say I'm really glad
and proud to be here tonight.

134
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,300
I'm glad to see Frank's dad made it out.
I haven't seen him in eight years.

135
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,200
That's great.
Congratulations.

136
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,300
I love you, Dad!

137
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,000
True love is hard to find.

138
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,200
Sometimes you think you have true love,

139
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,600
and then you catch the early flight
home from San Diego,

140
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,900
and a couple of nude people
jump out of your bathroom blindfolded

141
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,100
like a goddamn magic show,
ready to double- team your girlfriend...

142
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,900
It stops right there
and it continues right here,

143
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,400
because I think what Mitch is trying to say
is that true love is blind.

144
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,600
Let's raise our glasses,
whatever we got in front of us.

145
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,700
Salute. Health and happiness.

146
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,600
Cheers, everybody.

147
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,200
I love you so much, Frankie.
I love you.

148
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,100
I'm not a talker.

149
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,500
I love you.
Congratulations.

150
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,900
I thought you said near campus.
This is practically on-campus. It's sick.

151
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,200
- This is great.
- How did you land this place?

152
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,200
I don't know, it was pretty easy, actually.

153
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,900
A professor lived here for, like,
30 years, and then he died.

154
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,300
That's awesome!

155
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,800
That's awesome.

156
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,100
A little housewarming.

157
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,100
To new beginnings.

158
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,600
Thanks.

159
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,100
Actually, I gave this to you
for your wedding.

160
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,400
This model?

161
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,800
No, this exact one.

162
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,600
I'm sorry.

163
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
I'm embarrassed.
I'm sorry.

164
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,900
It's okay.

165
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,800
I hope you like it.

166
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,800
I love it.
Thank you.

167
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,900
This place is unbelievable.

168
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
- You like it?
- How could you still be depressed?

169
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,500
This is the probably the best thing
that's ever happened to us.

170
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,200
- Us?
- Yeah, us.

171
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,100
Do not get selfish on me here, okay?
Now stay with me.

172
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,100
You put a bar in over there, right?

173
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,400
Couple La-Z-Boys to fill it out, a smarter
couch. You could put a hot tub anywhere.

174
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,200
Max, can you earmuff it for me?

175
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,200
We're gonna get so much ass here,
it's gonna be sick.

176
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,400
I'm talking crazy, boy-band ass.

177
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,800
That sounds like a lot of fun, but

178
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,800
I need a little time to get
my life back together.

179
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,800
We need to throw a big
kick-ass party to start things off.

180
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,100
Absolutely.
Break it in a little, meet the neighbors.

181
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,100
Come on, Mitch.
You know what I'm talking about.

182
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,400
Break it in.

183
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,000
The real estate guy was really
adamant about not having...

184
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,900
I don't think you realize what
a huge opportunity this is for you.

185
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,700
Girls love a guy who's in your
particular situation.

186
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,900
What situation?

187
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,100
Mitch, you're on the rebound.

188
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,500
You're like an injured fawn
nursed back to health,

189
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,400
who's finally gonna be rereleased
into the wilderness.

190
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,000
Sorry.

191
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,700
Please be careful.

192
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,500
- I'm sorry. You okay?
- Don't say sorry to me, say it to the baby.

193
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,100
- You upset him.
- Sorry, baby.

194
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,100
It's okay. It happens.

195
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,500
We should go tropical with this thing.

196
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,800
Like sand from wall to wall. I know a great
sand guy, we'll get it at price.

197
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,900
Sand in here?

198
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,600
Or foam, whatever.
Something in here.

199
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,300
- You understand what I'm talking about?
- Absolutely.

200
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm good either way.
Just need to run it by Marissa.

201
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,600
I'm messing with you guys!
It's a joke!

202
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,000
It's not funny.
And now the baby is upset.

203
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,500
Hey!

204
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,100
Hey!

205
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,300
Hey, honey!

206
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,400
I brought you an iced tea!

207
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,700
No, thanks. I got a fresh beer.

208
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,900
Can you turn that off for a second?

209
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,900
Wow. That's really loud.

210
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,300
Yeah. Thanks.

211
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,500
I took the restrictor plate off,
give the Red Dragon a little more juice.

212
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,800
But let's keep that on the down low.
She's not exactly street legal.

213
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,100
Hey, Mike!

214
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,300
Right.

215
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,400
- So, what's up?
- Nothing much.

216
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,300
I was hoping we might get to those
thank you notes tomorrow night.

217
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,900
Honey, I got Mitch's thing tomorrow night.

218
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,300
Oh, that's right.
I totally forgot.

219
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,100
But I can skip it.

220
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,200
Oh! No.

221
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,800
Don't be silly.

222
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,700
I mean, I wouldn't want you changing
your whole life just for me.

223
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,500
I'll give Lara a call
and we'll plan a girls' night.

224
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,900
- It'll be fun.
- Thanks.

225
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,700
You're the best.

226
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,600
Just as long as you promise to take it easy,
you know.

227
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,900
- What do you mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.

228
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,000
You've come a long way since Frank the
Tank, and we don't want him coming back.

229
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,700
Honey, Frank the Tank
is not coming back, okay?

230
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,900
That part of me is over.
It's water under the bridge.

231
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,500
I promise.

232
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,500
Nice, right?

233
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
This is incredible.
How did you do this?

234
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,100
With all the people here,
and the speakers.

235
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,700
I thought we were having
a small get-together.

236
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,400
It's one of many
small get- togethers.

237
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,400
That's why you got the house, brother.

238
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,000
You're having fun?

239
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,600
- I'm having a great time.
- Good.

240
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,600
What else have you got planned?
A student band or something?

241
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,000
Yeah, that's it.

242
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,500
I got a student alt rock band
coming on stage next.

243
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,200
I own six Speaker Cities.

244
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,200
I'm worth $3.5 million,
that the government knows about.

245
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,200
I got more electronics up there
than a damn KlSS concert.

246
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,600
You think I'd roll out that kind of red
carpet for a fuckin' marching band?

247
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,200
Just make sure you can see the stage.

248
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,600
Excuse me. Pardon me.

249
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,900
I just want to get through this door,
if you don't mind.

250
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,100
Thank you.

251
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,900
This is the guy I was talking about.
This is his house.

252
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,400
- What's up, man?
- No, that's my friend, Mitch.

253
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,000
My friend Mitch, he owns the house.

254
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,700
Anyway, come hit this right here.
You need to hit this.

255
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,400
No, I appreciate it, but I told my wife
I wouldn't drink tonight.

256
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,300
Besides, I've got a big day tomorrow.
But you guys have a great time.

257
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,800
A big day? Doing what?

258
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,800
Well, actually,
pretty nice little Saturday.

259
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,500
We're going to Home Depot.

260
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,000
Buy some wallpaper,
maybe get some flooring.

261
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,100
Stuff like that. Maybe Bed, Bath
and Beyond, I don't know.

262
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,600
I don't know if we'll have enough time.

263
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,100
You know what? Give me that thing.
I'll do one.

264
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,400
He gonna do one!
He gonna do one!

265
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,200
That's a talented man right there.

266
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,400
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Fill it up again!

267
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,700
God, that's good.
It's so good!

268
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,400
Once it hits your lips,
it's so good.

269
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,000
Thank you very much, guys. This will be
happening at this house all year.

270
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,200
So just get ready,
don't burn yourselves out tonight.

271
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,100
I wanna thank you very much for coming to
the official Mitch Martin Freedom Festival.

272
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,500
For those who don't know
who Mitch Martin is,

273
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,700
he's the very successful,

274
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,800
very disease-free gentleman
standing by the mini-bar.

275
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,700
Now, courtesy of Speaker City,

276
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,600
which is slashing prices on everything
from beepers to DVD players,

277
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:15,000
give a warm Harrison University
welcome to my pal

278
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,600
and your favorite,
Mister Snoop Dogg.

279
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,200
Frank! Frank!

280
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,800
Whoo!

281
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:00,400
Frank the Tank!

282
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,500
You know it!

283
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,100
You're that guy.

284
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,100
What?

285
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,100
Mitch-a-Palooza, from the poster.

286
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,600
Yeah, that's me.

287
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,100
This party is great.
Nice work.

288
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,600
My friends put it on for me.

289
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,200
They're kind of rereleasing me
out into the wild.

290
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,500
What are you talking about?

291
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,100
Nothing. Sorry.

292
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,500
We're going streaking!

293
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,100
I'm sorry.

294
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,400
We're going streaking through the quad
and into the gymnasium.

295
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,800
Come on, everybody!

296
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,400
Come on, Snoop!

297
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,200
Snoop-a-loop!

298
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,300
Snoop!

299
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,700
No, it's cool. I'm cool.

300
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,700
Bring your green hat. Let's go.

301
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,200
Come on, everybody, we're going!

302
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,800
Here we go!

303
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,600
Man, man.
Man, put the music back on.

304
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,200
Let's get
the party back cracking up in here.

305
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,800
Whoo! Come on!

306
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,100
We're streaking.
Come on!

307
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,900
Come on, every...
We're... come on!

308
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,700
Whoo! Whoo!

309
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,200
We're streaking.
We're streaking!

310
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,300
Whooo!

311
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,000
Come on!

312
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,500
Oh, tell her!

313
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,400
Marissa, I totally forgot.

314
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,800
I know it's a little belated, but we got you
the perfect wedding present!

315
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,000
Come on, you guys, I told you,
you don't have to get me anything.

316
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Our friend Ashley had this guy come over
and teach a blow job class.

317
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,700
- It was incredible.
- A class?

318
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,600
And he's really good,
so we had to book him way in advance.

319
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,300
Why should I go to a class?

320
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,200
Bernard should be the one going to class.
I swear, the man is orally challenged.

321
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,600
- Wait a second, is that guy...

322
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,500
Oh, my God.

323
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,000
That's disgusting!

324
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,800
Why am I looking at that?

325
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,400
Why are you slowing down?

326
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,300
Just drive. Go.

327
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Frank?

328
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,500
No way.

329
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,600
Frank!

330
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,900
Hey, honey.

331
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,100
What the hell are you doing?

332
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,300
We're streaking. We're going up
through the quad to the gymnasium.

333
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,000
Who's streaking?

334
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,900
There's more coming.

335
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,600
Frank, get in the car.

336
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,500
- Everybody's doing it.
- Now!

337
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,600
Okay.

338
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,500
Whoa! Scooch over.

339
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,400
Hey, ladies.

340
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,100
Hey, Frank.
Looks like it's a little cold out there, huh?

341
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,700
Please, guys.

342
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,000
Honey, do you think KFC is still open?

343
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,700
Oh, shit.

344
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,400
Good morning.

345
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,900
Now, that was a party.

346
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,900
Since when are you so shy?

347
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,700
No, I'm not.
I just...

348
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,300
Did I snore last night?
Sometimes I snore when I'm drunk.

349
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,700
I don't remember.

350
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,800
I don't think so.

351
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,600
Listen, about last night.

352
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,800
I just got out of a very serious
and traumatic relationship.

353
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,800
I'm kind of in a weird place right now.

354
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,100
What?

355
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,500
Relax, Rich, it's not a big deal.

356
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,200
Mitch, with an "M."

357
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,500
Right. Look.

358
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,800
Whatever. We were just having a little fun.
You have nothing to worry about.

359
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,100
No.

360
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,700
Yeah, you're right.
I'm okay with it.

361
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,000
It's casual. I was just...

362
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,800
I got to go to class, so...

363
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,100
So, how do we do this? Shall I...

364
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,300
You want to leave me your number?

365
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,000
You don't even have to worry about it.

366
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,800
See you around.

367
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,500
Bye.

368
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,800
I love you.

369
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,700
At Speaker City, we're slashing prices
on everything from DVD players

370
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,900
to camcorders,
and everything in between.

371
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,200
Our courteous staff will educate you
on a wide selection of state-of-the-art

372
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,300
home theater equipment and accessories.

373
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,900
Show us a competitor's price.
We'll beat it.

374
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,800
If we can't beat it, I'll give you
the keys to the store. Literally.

375
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,200
Figuratively, I mean.

376
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,500
The only thing that sounds better
than our speakers are our prices!

377
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,900
Hi, silly kid.

378
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,800
What do you think? Honestly.
Shoot me straight.

379
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,100
Really good.

380
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,200
- You look great.
- Really?

381
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,200
God, I went a little bit...

382
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,600
Got crazy last night.

383
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,800
Yeah, I still haven't heard from Frank.
I'm a little worried.

384
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,800
Hello?

385
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,400
Come on in. Jesus!

386
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Is this one of your guys here?

387
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,200
- About three fire hazards over here.
- What are you doing, man?

388
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,800
Cheese, is that you?

389
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,600
Hello, Mitch, Bernard.
I see you guys haven't changed much.

390
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,600
Who is this?

391
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,900
Remember Cheese,
Rodney's kid brother?

392
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,900
Actually, my name isn't Cheese anymore.
It's Gordon Pritchard.

393
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,200
Oh, yeah!

394
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,200
Cheese!

395
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,800
Didn't we lock you in a dumpster one time?

396
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,400
I got out.

397
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,500
Cool, man.
I'm glad you did.

398
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,100
- You had a good time last night?
- Yeah.

399
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,600
There might be some whippits
lying around if you want them.

400
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,200
- No, thanks. I'm working.
- Working what?

401
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,500
Campus patrol?

402
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,800
- Try again.
- You a Jehovah's Witness?

403
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,600
- I'm the dean.

404
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,700
Dean Pritchard. Yeah.

405
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,900
And as of this morning,
this house has been rezoned.

406
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,100
It is now exclusively
for campus use only.

407
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,700
What are you talking about?

408
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,300
You can't just do that. I've already paid
the first and last month's rent!

409
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,600
Take a look at that.

410
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,500
You have a week to vacate the premises,
and I thank you for your cooperation.

411
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,900
Great.

412
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,100
- Can I ask you a question?
- Absolutely not.

413
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,700
It's been good seeing you guys.
It looks like you're doing great.

414
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,700
Frank, this is a safe place.

415
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,700
It's a place where we can feel free
sharing our feelings.

416
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,200
Think of my office as a nest
in a tree of trust and understanding.

417
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,800
We can say anything here.

418
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,800
Anything?

419
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,300
It's okay, honey.
That's why we came.

420
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:04,300
Well, I guess I...
Deep down I'm feeling a little confused.

421
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,500
I mean, suddenly you get married

422
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,100
and you're supposed
to be this entirely different guy.

423
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,000
I don't feel different.

424
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,900
Take yesterday, for example.

425
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,000
We were out at the Olive Garden
for dinner, which was lovely.

426
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,800
And...

427
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:26,800
I happened to look over during the meal
and see a waitress taking an order,

428
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:32,100
and I found myself wondering
what color her underpants might be.

429
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,500
Her panties.

430
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,900
Odds are they're probably
basic white, cotton underpants.

431
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,600
But I started thinking,
"Well, maybe they're silk panties."

432
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,400
"Maybe it's a thong."

433
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:53,900
"Maybe it's something really cool
that I don't even know about."

434
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,400
You know? And I started feeling...

435
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,800
What?

436
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,600
I thought we were in the trust tree,
in the nest. Are we not?

437
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,400
- We are. It's okay.
- Okay?

438
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,600
It's okay. Please continue.

439
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,600
I don't know
where I was going with that.

440
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,200
I guess what I'm trying to say
is that now that I'm married,

441
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,100
I'm definitely feeling
a little freaked out about the fact

442
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,300
that I'm gonna have sex
with only one person

443
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,100
for the rest of my life.

444
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,500
Walsh tells me
your San Diego trip was a blast!

445
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,900
Yeah.

446
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,400
How was Hooters?

447
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,600
I actually didn't go to Hooters.

448
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,200
Yeah, right.

449
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,800
Skittles?

450
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,200
No, thanks.

451
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,800
Listen. I got a call from Manetti.

452
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,900
He tells me that your Sunshine Square
proposal is totally fucked.

453
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,500
What's wrong with it?

454
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,100
Well, for one thing, it violates
the zoning restrictions set forth

455
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,800
in the National Historical
Preservation Act of 1966.

456
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,600
Most notably, clause four.

457
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,900
Shall I continue?

458
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,500
- Actually, I'm familiar with that item...
- Honey.

459
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,600
- Hi, Dad, am I interrupting?
- No, come in.

460
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,400
I don't think you've met my daughter.
Darcie, this is Mitch Martin.

461
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,500
Nice to meet you, Mitch.

462
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,600
Hi. Nice to meet you.

463
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,000
- How was the slumber party?
- Great. You know,

464
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,200
movies and popcorn.

465
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,200
She's an angel.

466
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,500
It makes me sound an old man, but I can't
believe how fast she's growing up.

467
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,400
- Dad, stop.
- I'm sorry honey, but it's true.

468
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,900
To think that in just seven months
you'll be graduating from high school!

469
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,600
You okay?

470
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,600
I thought you said high school.

471
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,700
Yeah.
Shocking, isn't it?

472
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,600
Yes, it is.

473
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,100
Give me a break.

474
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,800
Hey, Mitch.

475
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,900
Hey, man. Did you have a good day?

476
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,800
Not too bad.

477
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,500
What's going on?

478
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,700
I thought maybe I could crash here
tonight, if that's all right.

479
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,700
Marissa is going through
some personal stuff.

480
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,600
Personal stuff like you running through
the neighborhood drunk and naked?

481
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,300
That and some other stuff.

482
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,700
No problem.
Make yourself at home.

483
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,000
Thanks.

484
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,500
Gentlemen, we're discussing
a brand-new way to look at a fraternity.

485
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:45,100
In other words, forget all the normal rules
that apply to both college and society,

486
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,900
because this is a very big idea,
my friends.

487
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,200
We are talking about a non-exclusive,
egalitarian brotherhood

488
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,200
where community status
and more importantly, age,

489
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,500
have no bearing whatsoever.

490
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,800
Yeah? From the guy who probably
won't get in.

491
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,500
- I go to school here.
- Okay.

492
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,600
I was curious, what association
will you have with the actual university?

493
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,800
- Who are these people?
- I don't know.

494
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,200
Legally speaking,
there will be a loose affiliation,

495
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,600
but we will give nothing back
to the academic community.

496
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,600
As well as provide no public service
of any kind. This much I promise.

497
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,000
What the hell is going on here?

498
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,500
Guys, this is a very special occasion.

499
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,600
The Godfather himself has been kind
enough to grace us with his presence.

500
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,000
- The Godfather!

501
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,400
This is his damn house.
He lives here, he sleeps 20 feet away.

502
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,600
We need to talk.

503
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,900
Kitchen.

504
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,300
Sit good for me. I'm gonna talk
to Uncle Mitch for a second.

505
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,200
There you go, buddy.

506
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,400
- How long have these people been here?
- All day.

507
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,100
That party we had last night
has given us all kinds of street cred.

508
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,000
What are you talking about?

509
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,500
This is called "rush."
We're officially starting a fraternity.

510
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,500
I like it. It's genius!

511
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,200
You've got to be kidding me.

512
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,400
You heard Pritchard, all right?
We're obligated to do this.

513
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,600
This house, he says, is zoned specifically
for social services and student housing.

514
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,500
Fraternity solves both of those.

515
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,200
But this is my house.
I live here, Beanie.

516
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,600
I'm 30 years old.
None of us are enrolled in the college.

517
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,400
I understand that. You're focused
on all the wrong sort of details.

518
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,400
Did you or did you not
have a good time at the party?

519
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,300
I had an awesome time.

520
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,700
I know you had an awesome time.

521
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,300
The entire town knows
you had an awesome time.

522
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,900
I'm trying to ask Mitch whether
he had an awesome time.

523
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,700
- I had a good time.
- Okay, that's good.

524
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,800
Wouldn't you want those good times
to keep going?

525
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,200
- More good...
- God. I mean...

526
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:42,000
I don't understand. I don't know why it's
so hard for you to admit you want this.

527
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,500
We got 40 guys that want this.
There must be a reason for it.

528
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,800
Look, I appreciate your enthusiasm.

529
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,800
I know you guys are trying to help,
but the truth of the matter is,

530
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,700
I've had a hell of a day,
an even worse month.

531
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,800
And the fact is,
I've got 40 strangers out in my living room

532
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,600
and all I want to do is
get some fuckin' sleep.

533
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:07,000
So, I'm sorry, but we're not
starting a fraternity.

534
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,200
I don't know why you got to do it
in front of the kid, with the "F'ing."

535
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,400
All you got to do is
say "earmuffs" to him.

536
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,500
Then you can say,
"fuck, shit, bitch," whatever you want.

537
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,900
Cock. Balls.

538
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,800
I'm just proving a point.
You don't have to celebrate it, Frank.

539
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,200
- Sorry.
- Don't say sorry to me.

540
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,900
You let down Frank, you let down me,
you let down Max, most importantly.

541
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,200
And right about now, I'm
having a real hard time trying

542
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,800
to figure out why I take my time out of
my schedule to try to help you get over...

543
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,900
Earmuffs. That whore that you dated.

544
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,900
Wanna go out and see the other guys?
Uncle Mitch is sorry.

545
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,000
Say "yes."

546
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,200
Yes.

547
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,200
Here's the deal.
Listen up!

548
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,100
All together, we've picked
14 pledges.

549
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,100
Wait, who's this guy?

550
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,600
That's Blue.

551
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,000
He's an old Navy vet
who hangs around my store a lot.

552
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,800
But don't worry about it.
He's legit.

553
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,400
He looks like he's 100 years old.
He wants to pledge?

554
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,100
Are you kidding me?
The Old Man River won't shut up about it.

555
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,200
Go time!

556
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,300
Don't make this any harder
on yourself!

557
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,800
What's going on?

558
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,400
You tell anyone about this,
I'll fuckin' kill you!

559
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,400
I'm kidding. We'll have him back tonight.
Okay, sweetie?

560
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,800
Let's go!

561
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,000
Come on, let's go.
There we go, Blue.

562
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,200
Congratulations, gentlemen.

563
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,300
You should all be
very proud of yourselves.

564
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,400
Each and every one of you
has been hand-picked

565
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,900
to represent our inaugural
pledge class.

566
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,600
Over the next 21 days,

567
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:31,200
you're all going to experience intense
mental and physical strain.

568
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,100
D-ahhh!

569
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,900
Frank, just pace yourself.

570
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,800
Copy that. Just got
a little overexcited. Sorry.

571
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:45,100
At this point
you may be asking yourself,

572
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:50,000
"Why am I holding
this 30-pound cinderblock in my hands?"

573
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,000
You might also ask yourself,

574
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,400
"Why does this cinderblock
have a long piece of string

575
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,900
tied to it?"

576
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,800
And finally,

577
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:11,700
"Why's the other end of this string
tied securely

578
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,200
to your penis?"

579
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,700
And the answer, ladies, is trust.

580
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,000
This is your first test.

581
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,100
Spanish!

582
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,800
Do you trust we've provided you
with enough slack

583
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,400
so your block will land safely
on the lawn?

584
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,000
Sir, yes, sir.

585
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,900
- And Blue!
- Yes, sir?

586
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,300
Do you trust that I do not want
to see you die here tonight?

587
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,700
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Blue, you're my boy!

588
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,100
Thank you, sir.

589
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,100
About face.

590
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,200
Step to the edge!

591
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,600
Pledges, prepare to release!

592
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,400
One...

593
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,000
two...

594
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,700
three! Release!

595
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,800
Aahh!

596
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,300
Oh...!

597
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,000
Wasn't meant to happen
like that, Weensie!

598
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,700
Walk it off, big guy.
We're coming down.

599
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:33,100
One two three four

600
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,600
One more lap and I'll be dead

601
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,600
- Faster!

602
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,200
Jesus. Who are these people?

603
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,700
Patricia, get security
to the South Lawn.

604
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,500
We have an illegal off-road vehicle
operating without a permit.

605
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,700
They've already been called, sir.

606
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,000
Call them again.

607
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:06,300
It's been two weeks.
How are these guys still a fraternity?

608
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,200
They're not a fraternity, sir.

609
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,200
They've been approved for temporary
status by the student council.

610
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,600
Half these guys don't even
go to the school.

611
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,600
You see the one guy, he's like 90.

612
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,500
Technically, that doesn't matter.
They found a loophole.

613
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,000
- A loophole?
- Yes.

614
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,700
Well, it's interesting, sir.

615
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:25,100
As stupid as they appear,
they're actually very good at paperwork.

616
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,900
It's quite an anomaly.

617
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,300
I'm sorry, is that funny?
Are you a standup comic?

618
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,800
Is that what you do now?

619
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,000
This is me leaving. This is me leaving.

620
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,500
There he is.

621
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,100
What's going on, brother?

622
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,400
Nothing.
Just making some copies.

623
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,200
See you later.

624
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,400
Hey, Mitch, hang on a second.

625
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,300
I heard you guys are
starting up a fraternity.

626
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,800
Who told you that?

627
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,900
Nobody. Is it true?

628
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,500
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Right.

629
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,000
It sounds cool, man.
I want in.

630
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,400
Listen to me.
There is no fraternity.

631
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,800
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

632
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,600
You listen to me.
I need this, okay?

633
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,900
My wife, my job, my kids.
Every day is exactly the same.

634
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,300
I go golfing on Sundays.

635
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,400
I hate golf.

636
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,800
Don't blackball me, Mitch.
Please.

637
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,500
I am not blackballing you.
We work together, Walsh.

638
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,800
And I don't want to mix work
with whatever it is I do at home.

639
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,200
Trust me, you're not
missing anything, anyways.

640
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,500
Really?

641
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,000
Heard you hooked up
with Goldberg's daughter.

642
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,000
Sorry. Sorry.

643
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,100
That is untrue!

644
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,600
Hey, Mitch, all I'm saying is
think about it, okay?

645
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,200
Think about it!

646
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,400
So what?
Who cares if you work with the guy?

647
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,900
I do. I mean, I have a career
to worry about.

648
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:10,000
You're killing me. You really need
to start embracing this whole thing here.

649
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,000
The frustrating thing is I don't think
you appreciate everything I did for you.

650
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,000
- For me?
- Yeah, for you.

651
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:18,400
You think I like avoiding my wife and kids
to hang out with 19-year-old girls all day?

652
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,100
- Yeah, I do.
- Well, I don't, man.

653
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,400
- I'm doing this whole thing for you.
- Hello.

654
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,700
Nicole, how's it going?
Who's this?

655
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,000
This is my daughter, Amanda.
Say hi, sweetie.

656
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,400
Hi, Amanda.
You remember Nicole, right?

657
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:34,000
Yeah, we did a little chicken dancing
at the wedding, actually.

658
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,200
- How you been?
- Fine, thanks.

659
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,100
Good.

660
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:40,100
I actually wanted
to apologize to you about the wedding.

661
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,000
I hope I didn't embarrass you.

662
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,000
It's okay.
You just embarrassed yourself.

663
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,700
- I brought you a housewarming gift.
- That is really nice.

664
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,600
It's just a CD holder, you know, for your
desk or whatever. I thought it was...

665
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,200
No, that thing's a piece of crap.
Awful.

666
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,300
- I stopped selling it six months ago.
- Please, hey, Beanie.

667
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,000
- Thanks.
- A lot of complaints.

668
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,300
- But it's a nice gesture, I think.
- No, this is cool.

669
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,900
Hey, Godfather!

670
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,400
- What's up?
- Yo, you the man, dog!

671
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,900
See you around, homey!

672
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,900
Did that guy just call you
the Godfather?

673
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,700
Must be joking around or something.

674
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,400
Where are you guys living now?

675
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,600
We're staying with my dad for awhile,
until I find something better.

676
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,600
The move's been a little rough on Amanda.

677
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:25,400
My son Max is turning six on Sunday.
We're having a birthday party for him.

678
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,800
Just like, petting zoo and clowns,
stuff like that.

679
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,800
But you guys are welcome to come,
if you like.

680
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,000
- Great idea! You should definitely come.
- Okay.

681
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,600
What do you guys like better?
Nurse or cheerleader?

682
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,900
Hi, Nicole.

683
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,900
Hi, Frank.

684
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,400
It's a nice doll you have there.

685
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,600
Yeah, thanks.
She's okay.

686
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,100
Did you have fun at the wedding?

687
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,800
Yeah, it was fun.

688
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:55,000
I'm just staying here, for right now.

689
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,800
Anyways, we'll see you Sunday then.

690
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,800
Sunday, right. Okay.

691
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,700
- Bye. Say bye.
- Bye.

692
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,100
Bye.

693
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,400
- Hi, you've reached Marissa.
- And Frank!

694
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,900
We're not here,
so leave us a message.

695
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,600
Hey, honey, it's me.

696
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:20,300
Listen, just was calling to check in.

697
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:24,000
I been kind of busy lately.
A lot of paperwork, stuff like that.

698
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,100
Damn it.

699
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,700
If you are satisfied, press "1. "
To rerecord, press "2. "

700
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,700
Hey, Marissa, it's me.
Listen.

701
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,100
Gonna be in the neighborhood
a little bit later.

702
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,000
Didn't know if you wanted to
get together for frozen yogurt sometime,

703
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,400
or maybe even a whole meal of food.

704
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,000
If that'd be agreeable...
Stupid.

705
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:49,200
If you are satisfied, press "1. "
To rerecord, press "2. "

706
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,800
Hey, Marissa, it's Frank Ricard...

707
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,300
Okay, ladies.

708
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,400
The secret to a good B.J. is focus.

709
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,700
I don't care
if it's your husband of 10 years

710
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,800
or some hot sailor you met
at TGl Friday's a couple months ago.

711
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,400
Who never did call me back

712
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,900
but did leave me with a
little something called herpes.

713
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,900
Which I then gave to the dog.

714
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,100
But that's neither here nor there.

715
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,800
Grab your vegetables.

716
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:28,000
Who's hungry? Who's hungry?

717
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,200
Come on.
Is this guy for real?

718
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,400
Yeah, he's fine.
He's the best there is.

719
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,600
Ladies, our thumbs are down,
our wrists are flexed,

720
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,100
and we're gonna position
ourselves for insertion.

721
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,000
Ready? Do it.

722
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,600
Um hmm.
Good, Marissa.

723
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,500
You can use a little teeth
but don't be a biter.

724
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,100
Now you're going to do
the work, ladies.

725
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,900
These carrots are not going
to ejaculate themselves.

726
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,400
Get into it.
Very good.

727
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,200
Very good.

728
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,800
Good, good, good.
Not so good.

729
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,700
Please, what are you doing?

730
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,900
You're not Romulus sucking on
the teats of the mother wolf.

731
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,900
If you know your Greek mythology.

732
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,900
Ladies, we are giving head here.

733
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
We're not breast feeding
from a mythological beast.

734
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,200
Oh, that's funny to you?
'Cause you won't be laughing

735
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,200
when somebody prematurely
pops in your face.

736
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,700
It stings, and that is now
why I have a lazy eye.

737
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,600
Thank you very much.
Continue, please, continue.

738
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:31,200
Up and in.

739
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,700
And mind the stepchildren.

740
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,900
Mind the stepchildren.

741
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,900
Marissa, come on.
That's it.

742
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,400
I like what I see.
Don't be afraid to arch it.

743
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,500
Marissa, come on.
That's it.

744
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:14,500
Everybody can learn from Marissa.
I'm gonna take a quick five.

745
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,500
You guys continue.

746
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,700
Nice work, Marissa.

747
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,700
Way to give a hundred and ten percent.

748
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,300
When I get back there,
I'm gonna show you something I call

749
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Penis."

750
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,100
Did you see that movie?

751
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,900
I really like it 'cause of
the flying and the magic.

752
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:39,300
Bastard!

753
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,800
Someone just make a bad mistake!

754
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,100
Jesus Christ, Frank!
What the hell are you doing here?

755
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,000
You know this person?

756
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,100
I am so sorry.
Are you hurt?

757
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,200
- Yes, I'm hurt.

758
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,300
Bob's not here. They're on the rocks.

759
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,200
You've outdone yourself once again.

760
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,200
It's nice, right?
Spanish, what the hell are you doing?

761
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,900
Man, I'm just getting some water, yo.
This suit is crazy hot.

762
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,800
Put your head on. Are you nuts?
That can be very traumatic for these kids.

763
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,300
- You're right, I'm sorry, sir.
- Don't "sorry" me.

764
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,800
Shake the tail when you walk, man.
You're better than that.

765
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,000
Take it easy.

766
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,700
You don't see me breaking
the fourth wall.

767
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,800
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

768
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,700
- Nice costume.
- Thanks a lot.

769
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,000
- This is a great party.
- When'd you get here?

770
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:41,000
Just a few minutes ago.
This is my boyfriend, Mark.

771
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:44,500
Flew over from Colorado yesterday.
This is Mitch and Beanie.

772
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,200
How's it hanging, boys?

773
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,300
Pleasure to meet you.

774
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,900
So, listen, somebody told me

775
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,500
you guys are in a fraternity,
is that right?

776
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,000
- No.
- A fraternity. Is that true?

777
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,700
Not really. I mean, no.
It's more kind of like a social club.

778
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,200
We just kinda watch football
and hang out.

779
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,800
Hang out and spank each other, I bet.

780
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,000
It's not like that.
We don't take it too seriously...

781
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:10,200
Blue! How come there's no ice
in my lemonade?

782
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,700
Sorry, sir!

783
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,200
You drop down
and you give me ten!

784
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,700
- Now!
- Yes, sir.

785
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,500
Let's go!

786
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,700
That's Frank.

787
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,800
I'm gonna go ahead and give you these.
It's my work phone. Call me.

788
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,400
Speaker City. I own all six locations.

789
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,700
Max wants to open up his gifts,
but I thought maybe one would be all right?

790
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,700
Come on in here, Maxy.
You guys mind giving me a minute?

791
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,500
We'll talk surround sound and
everything else later. I'll cut you a deal.

792
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,600
I'm not gonna hold you over
the coals for it.

793
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,300
How you doing, bud?
What a day!

794
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,200
We can open Uncle Frank's,
but we got to wait for the others.

795
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,900
I don't know who's more excited,
Frank or Max.

796
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,700
Rip it up! Go at there. What is it?

797
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:50,000
Could it be a space ship?
Let's see what we got!

798
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,200
Yay!

799
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,700
What do you think, Max, huh?
It's got three speeds.

800
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,500
Damn it.

801
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,500
Excuse me.
I'll have one of those.

802
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,900
I'm Mark. What's your name?

803
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,100
Tracy.

804
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,200
Nice meeting you, Tracy.

805
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:23,300
- Right on there.
- There we go.

806
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,900
Okay, you can go back out
and play now.

807
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,200
Come on.

808
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,800
There. Take your doll. Okay.

809
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,600
I think she likes you.
She ignores most people.

810
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,200
I feel honored.

811
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:43,600
So, Mark, he seems like
an interesting guy.

812
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,200
He's harmless.

813
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,800
- How long have you two been together?
- Two years now.

814
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:52,400
I told him I had a crush on you
in high school and I think I got him jealous.

815
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,400
You had a crush on me?

816
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,700
You got to be kidding me.
I was obsessed with you.

817
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:02,300
Not in a dangerous way, you know.
I just watched you a lot, from a distance.

818
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,600
How come you never
asked me out then?

819
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:07,200
You were pretty intimidating back then.

820
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:11,800
You were always with older guys.
You had that Whitesnake jean jacket.

821
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:15,000
You smoked Marlboro Reds.
You were way out of my league.

822
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,800
I still have the Whitesnake
jean jacket.

823
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,800
I'm still pretty intimidated by you.

824
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:31,300
You're bad.

825
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,100
You're right. I am bad.

826
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,900
I'm sorry...

827
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,300
- I guess we're not knocking?
- Excuse me.

828
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,600
Excuse me, I've got to get
back to work.

829
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,200
...just returning these Band-Aids.

830
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,500
What are you gonna do?
Tell on me?

831
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:53,500
You know you can't, buddy.
It's guy code. Okay?

832
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,800
Guys don't tell on other guys.
That's, uh...

833
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,600
something chicks do.

834
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,300
You're not a chick, are you?

835
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,800
All right. Good talk.
I'll see you out there.

836
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:19,900
Hey there, buddy.

837
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,700
Need a friend?

838
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,200
Yeah, me, too.

839
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,500
Hey.

840
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,600
Wow.

841
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:42,300
- She's a beauty, ain't she?
- Yeah.

842
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,500
What kind of gun is this?

843
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,500
That's a tranquilizer gun.

844
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,900
If any of these little fuckers decide to
freak out on the kids,

845
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,400
I get to take them down.

846
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,900
Ain't that right, mother?
What?

847
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,100
That's what I thought. Shut up.

848
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,700
Hey, be careful with that.

849
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,500
That's the most powerful
tranq gun on the market.

850
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,200
Got her in Mexico.

851
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,600
- Cool.
- Yeah, it is cool.

852
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,600
They say it could puncture
the skin of a rhino from a hundred...

853
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,800
Oww! Oh...

854
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,300
Yes!

855
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,900
That's awesome!

856
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,100
What?

857
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,200
You just took one
in the jugular, man!

858
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:28,500
Ha! Whoa.

859
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,100
Yes!

860
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,500
Oh, my God.

861
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,000
Oh, my God, I did.
Is this bad?

862
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,100
Is this bad?

863
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,900
You should pull that out.
That shit is not cool.

864
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,000
Wait.

865
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,600
Wait. Pull what out?

866
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:52,200
The dart, man.
You got a fuckin' dart in your neck.

867
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,200
You're craz... You're crazy, man.

868
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,100
You're crazy.

869
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,900
I like you.

870
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:04,400
But you're crazy.

871
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:07,800
I feel tired.

872
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
No!

873
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,600
My old friend

874
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,900
With you again

875
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,200
This is the most beautiful day.

876
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,800
Yes.

877
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,300
It really is.

878
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,500
I've missed you, Frank.

879
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,000
I'm so glad you're back.

880
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,900
I've missed you too, honey.

881
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,100
You look gorgeous.

882
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,400
You're sweet.

883
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:49,000
To the cold and damp

884
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:00,100
- He just French kissed me!

885
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,800
This better work.

886
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:10,800
The board members are beginning to ask
questions about this "civilian fraternity."

887
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:13,200
Don't worry, it'll work.

888
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,300
Here she comes.
Her name is Megan Huang.

889
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:19,800
She's student council president,

890
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:23,600
prelaw, star of the tennis team,
a very promising young woman.

891
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,500
A young woman with a lot to lose.

892
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,200
- Megan, hello.
- Hi.

893
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,800
Have a seat.

894
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,700
I'm sure you know Dean Pritchard.

895
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,300
Don't turn around.

896
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:45,700
Megan, this little fraternity
over on Brook Street

897
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:49,600
has become quite an inconvenience
for us, okay?

898
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:53,800
And as student body president,
you approved their temporary status.

899
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:57,900
Unfortunately, you alone
have the ability to revoke it.

900
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,400
So, we're gonna need you to
go ahead and do that.

901
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,800
Revoke it? Why?
Everybody loves those guys.

902
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:08,100
They throw the sickest parties.
I met my boyfriend at their casino night.

903
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,100
Uh-huh, that's great.

904
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,600
It says here you are applying
to Columbia Law School.

905
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,400
Wow, that's a tough school
to get into.

906
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:20,400
You know, Dean Pritchard has
some serious connections at Columbia.

907
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,800
Are you bribing me?

908
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,100
Don't make life
harder on yourself, Chang.

909
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:29,700
It's Huang.

910
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:33,400
Whatever.
How's the tennis season going?

911
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:37,600
I made some minor changes,
but overall it's okay.

912
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,400
- It's a pretty standard lease.
- Okay, great.

913
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:44,500
Thank you for taking a look at it for me.
This stuff always confuses me.

914
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,800
Anytime.

915
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,700
So, you and Mark are
moving in together?

916
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:54,500
Yeah.
Well, financially it makes sense, so...

917
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,600
You know, there's something
I think you should know...

918
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,300
about Mark.

919
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,900
What is it?

920
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:07,600
Well...

921
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,100
Relationships are a lot of work.

922
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:15,200
And, I guess what I'm saying is...

923
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,600
Good luck.

924
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:25,100
Oh, okay.
Well, thank you.

925
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,000
Yeah. Listen.

926
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:31,500
I was thinking maybe sometime
we could get some dinner or something?

927
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,500
- Yeah.
- If that's okay with you.

928
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,400
- I'd like that.
- Yeah.

929
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:40,100
Of course, leave it to me to wait until
you've got a boyfriend

930
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,000
to finally ask you out.

931
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,800
Timing was never your thing.

932
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,200
No.

933
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:49,200
Okay, so, thank you.

934
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,400
And, call me about dinner.

935
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,600
- I will.
- Excuse me, sir!

936
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,700
We have a situation, sir!

937
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,000
What are you guys doing here?
I said never at work.

938
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,500
But it's an emergency.

939
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,100
We can only buy KY Jelly
in the 4-ounce tubes.

940
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:09,200
Industrial size cans will take up to
3 to 4 business days, so we're screwed.

941
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,400
What's all that for?

942
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,600
It's Blue's birthday.
We're having a KY wrestling match.

943
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:16,000
You know what?
Can we talk about this later, please?

944
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,800
I'm going again, baby!

945
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,700
- Whoo-hoo!

946
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,400
Yeah! Yeah!

947
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:37,500
This doesn't seem fair!
I'm on a roll!

948
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:52,900
Rip his head off!

949
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:07,200
I like your room.

950
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,800
Thanks a lot. It's kind of
a home away from home for me.

951
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,000
All the posters are mine.

952
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:16,700
I don't usually like fraternity guys.
They're such losers.

953
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:20,900
But, you're like... mature.

954
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,700
Mature?

955
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,000
Yeah.

956
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,400
So, where do you sleep, anyway?

957
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,200
Usually, I sleep at home.

958
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,600
Sometimes I do crash here.

959
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:36,100
This is a futon, actually.
It pulls out, you know.

960
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,700
Cool, I didn't realize.

961
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:40,000
Can I see it?

962
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,000
The futon?

963
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,800
Yeah.

964
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,100
Wow.

965
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,500
Amy, I'm sorry.

966
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,300
I'm married.
And I can't do this.

967
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,300
I don't want this to get weird, but...

968
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,000
Right. I see.

969
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,500
But why don't you
leave me your number?

970
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,700
This way, if something happens to my wife,
I can give you a call.

971
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,500
- I don't think so.
- Okay, that was a bad idea.

972
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,500
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to tonight's main event!

973
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:25,200
In this corner,
weighing in at 110 pounds,

974
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:28,200
and pushing 89 years of age,

975
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:31,400
the recent recipient of a brand-new
plastic hip,

976
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,800
Joseph "Blue" Pulasky!

977
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,700
And in the opposite corner,
with a combined weight of 210 pounds,

978
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,500
hailing from Hayden dormitory,

979
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,600
Jenny and Jeanie!

980
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,500
Fighters, are you ready?

981
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,900
Blue, you sure
you're okay with this?

982
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:03,800
Just ring the fucking bell, you pansy.

983
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,200
Let's get it on!

984
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:14,500
- Come on.
- Come on, grandpa, let's go.

985
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:16,900
Let's go, birthday boy!

986
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,800
What's the matter, you scared?

987
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:21,200
Hello?

988
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:46,500
And the moment's gone

989
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:56,600
In curiosity

990
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:03,900
Looks like we better put the KY wrestling
on hold for a while.

991
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,100
Good idea.

992
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:10,500
Please don't beat yourself up
over this thing. It's not your fault.

993
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,900
Damn it, Blue was old.

994
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,800
That's what old people do.
They die.

995
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,500
I'm sorry.

996
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:22,700
Dust in the wind

997
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,000
You're my boy, Blue!

998
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,400
You're my boy.

999
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:41,400
It's been a weird month, huh?

1000
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:42,900
Yeah.

1001
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:48,200
Listen, I'm sorry I didn't call you
on your birthday.

1002
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:50,300
My birthday, what do you mean?

1003
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,200
Yeah, last Thursday.

1004
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,500
- You forgot your birthday, didn't you?
- Damn it!

1005
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,600
I'm such an idiot.

1006
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:04,900
- What have you been doing?
- I've been keeping busy.

1007
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,400
I... tried to join a new gym.

1008
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,100
That was one thing.

1009
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:17,600
And there's other stuff.
I can't remember, but, keeping busy.

1010
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:21,400
You know, I've missed you.
You know?

1011
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,100
I want you to know that.

1012
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,800
I was even thinking maybe tonight
we could get together back at home,

1013
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:29,700
and, I don't know,
maybe put on the Sisqo CD...

1014
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,400
I don't think that's such a good idea.

1015
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:35,100
Really? You don't?

1016
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,100
I don't know.

1017
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:40,300
Maybe we rushed into this,
you know?

1018
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:45,400
I mean, it just doesn't
feel right, does it?

1019
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,800
Being married?

1020
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,200
What do you mean?

1021
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,400
I mean, I think we should
get a divorce.

1022
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,100
Like a real divorce?

1023
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:02,500
Yeah.

1024
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,400
Gotcha.

1025
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:07,700
Okay, well...

1026
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,600
I'm sorry.

1027
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:13,400
No. Actually, I got to run.

1028
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:18,500
But, if I don't talk to you,

1029
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:21,100
keep on, keep trucking, you know?

1030
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:26,100
Okay, good stuff.

1031
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:40,000
Well, what do you think?

1032
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,200
Yeah, it's okay.

1033
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,500
- Just okay?
- Yeah.

1034
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:49,600
I had Mitch take a look at the lease.
He thinks it sounds like a good deal.

1035
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:52,500
You had Mitch look at the lease?
When?

1036
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:55,000
Last week,
I stopped by his office.

1037
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,300
- Oh, God.
- What?

1038
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:00,000
I don't know.

1039
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,400
I'm not so sure about that guy.

1040
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,700
Mitch? Why? He's so sweet.

1041
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:08,500
Something I saw last week,
at the birthday party.

1042
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,200
What did you see?

1043
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:13,100
I didn't want to get into this, but...

1044
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:17,600
I walked in on him, and he was
harassing one of the caterers.

1045
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,000
A young girl.

1046
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:21,000
- Really?
- Yeah.

1047
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,800
He was being aggressive
and grabbing her and stuff.

1048
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:26,600
It was disgusting.
I didn't want to say anything

1049
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:28,200
'cause he's your friend.

1050
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,600
- Hello?
- Hey Nicole, it's Mitch.

1051
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:32,200
Hi, Mitch.

1052
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:35,200
I was thinking, if you're not too busy,

1053
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,500
maybe I'd take you up
on that cup of coffee.

1054
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:41,200
- Now's not really a good time.
- Look.

1055
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:46,200
I'm really sorry about the other day.
I want the chance to explain everything.

1056
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:49,100
- I don't think so.
- It's...

1057
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,100
It's been kind of a tough day,

1058
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,600
and it'd really mean a lot.

1059
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:01,100
Listen, there are a few things
I wanted to clear up,

1060
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:05,700
because I get the feeling you have
an entirely distorted view of who I am.

1061
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:08,500
Really? What would
ever give you that idea?

1062
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:11,500
Okay, that's one pecan pie
and two coffees.

1063
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:15,200
And don't worry. For the Godfather,
it's always on the house.

1064
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,000
- Not here.
- I know who you are.

1065
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,300
I am Avi. I'm a big supporter
of what you guys are doing.

1066
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,300
Thank you.

1067
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:24,900
You are beautiful.
No offense, though. He is the king.

1068
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,500
You are taking coffee and pie
with a living legend.

1069
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:30,000
That's very kind,
but I insist, I'll pay.

1070
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,000
Your money, it's not good here.

1071
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:34,500
- Okay.
- I look forward to pledging next semester.

1072
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:39,700
Okay, now don't you think
this is going a little far?

1073
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:42,900
I heard one of your pledges died.
Is that true?

1074
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,600
Well, yes.
But he was really old.

1075
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:49,500
And I feel pretty confident that
when we get the autopsy back,

1076
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,800
it'll show that it was probably
of natural causes.

1077
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:56,100
Look, to be honest, you're really not
the person I thought you were.

1078
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,600
But it's okay. It's not a big deal.

1079
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:01,000
I think that I am that person.

1080
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:04,700
And I feel more like myself now
than I have in a really long time.

1081
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:07,900
So, that's why you go around
harassing young women?

1082
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,700
- Doing what?
- The caterer.

1083
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:12,800
At the birthday party.
Mark told me about her.

1084
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:16,200
Wait a second.
I didn't want to say anything,

1085
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:19,500
but Mark is the one
who was acting inappropriate.

1086
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,800
- You are unbelievable.
- It's true.

1087
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:23,700
Hey, look who it is.

1088
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,400
Hey, Mitch.

1089
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:26,900
Darcie, hey.

1090
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:29,900
Hi. I've been meaning to call you.

1091
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,300
I just didn't want you
to worry about my dad.

1092
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:35,200
He doesn't know anything,
so it's totally cool.

1093
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,400
Her dad?

1094
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:38,300
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1095
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,800
You know, it's nothing, really.
I mean, they actually work together.

1096
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:49,800
We gotta run, 'cause we got this prom
committee thing, so I'll see you around.

1097
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:50,800
Sorry.

1098
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,400
Bye.

1099
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,300
Prom committee thing?

1100
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,800
That I actually can explain.

1101
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:00,000
Right, I'm sure you can.

1102
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:02,600
- I have to go.
- Please wait a second.

1103
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:05,600
No, really. I have to go.

1104
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,500
Hey. Chicks.

1105
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,500
Don't worry for her.

1106
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:17,700
Love, it's a motherfucker.

1107
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:53,500
Dear Mitch, if you're holding this letter,
you already know.

1108
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:57,900
The house has been boarded up.
The windows, the doors, everything.

1109
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,800
We're at the Comfort Inn,
room 112.

1110
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:02,900
I love you. Frank.

1111
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:07,600
Due to these infractions,
not only will your house be repossessed,

1112
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:11,200
but those of you who are students
will be expelled from the university

1113
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:14,400
for your participation in
a non-sanctioned fraternity.

1114
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:18,200
Please take a moment to
allow this information to sink in.

1115
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,700
Good. Believe me,

1116
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:30,800
the actions taken by the student council
have come as a great shock to me.

1117
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:34,000
But unfortunately, there's nothing
I can do about it.

1118
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:38,000
Thank you for your time.
Good luck, and God bless America.

1119
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,300
He can't do that.

1120
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:47,400
This guy's playing hardball.

1121
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:51,500
I got to say,
I'm kind of impressed by him.

1122
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:52,900
Well, we're expelled.

1123
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,500
My life is over and I'm gonna wind up
working at Red Lobster.

1124
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:59,300
- You already work in Red Lobster.
- Yeah, but it's part time, dick.

1125
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:02,000
- Guys.
- Hey, listen.

1126
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,500
This is a serious situation.
I mean, I'm kicked out of school.

1127
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,400
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
My mom's gonna kill me.

1128
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:12,700
Come on, she's not gonna kill you.

1129
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:16,100
Yes, she is. I'm the first one
to go to college in my family.

1130
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:21,400
When I left, she said, "Weensie,
if you screw this up, I'll kill you."

1131
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,800
She showed me the knife.

1132
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,300
- Shhh.

1133
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:32,000
Mitch is a lawyer, buddy.
He's gonna take care of this thing, okay?

1134
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:33,700
It's gonna be all right.

1135
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:39,000
He was supposed to be Luke Skywalker.

1136
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:41,700
Guys, still want to be in the fraternity?

1137
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,800
We've been waiting all semester
for you to ask us that.

1138
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:49,100
Good. I need your help with something.

1139
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,800
Off the record.
You do this, you're in.

1140
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:53,300
Sir, yes, sir.

1141
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:57,300
Okay. Walsh, I need you to track down
a copy of University Code 7- A,

1142
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,400
- then fax it to this number immediately.
- Got it.

1143
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:01,800
- I need to talk to you.
- Give me five minutes.

1144
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:04,700
Booker, make two copies of this petition,
have it notarized,

1145
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,400
and then messenger it over
to 34 Langley, and then I need-

1146
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:10,800
Listen, Donald tells me you got these guys
working prep for the arbitration.

1147
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:14,100
I told you five times, I want them working
the Sunshine Square deal.

1148
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,800
Well, I locked
the Sunshine Square deal yesterday,

1149
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:19,100
so now I have them helping
with the arbitration,

1150
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,800
and I'd appreciate it if you let me
handle my own team,

1151
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:25,000
and don't get on my ass
every time I'm trying to do something.

1152
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,000
All right.

1153
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Wanna make sure
you're on top of it.

1154
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:31,500
Well, I am.

1155
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,800
Well, good. Carry on.

1156
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:36,900
See? That's why they call him
the Godfather.

1157
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:37,800
Hey.

1158
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,200
Just take care of it.

1159
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:48,100
Gentlemen, I got some good news
and I got some bad news.

1160
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:50,100
Did a little research.

1161
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:53,500
What Pritchard did, technically,
is illegal.

1162
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,600
We have the right to a formal evaluation

1163
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,300
before they can deny
our official application.

1164
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:02,300
However, we're now subject to
a charter certification review

1165
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,800
given by the board of trustees.

1166
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:05,300
Damn it.

1167
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:09,000
Wait. Wait, what does
that mean exactly?

1168
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,900
According to university bylaws,
it's a thorough inspection of the fraternity,

1169
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
and our contribution to the community.

1170
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:17,300
Focus is on five categories:

1171
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:20,700
Academics, athletics, community service,

1172
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,400
debate, and school spirit.

1173
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,700
Good luck to everybody.
It was nice to know you all.

1174
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,700
And I'll see you around campus.

1175
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:31,700
Actually, all of us are
being tested. Yeah.

1176
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:34,700
What are you talking about?
I'm not even in school.

1177
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,400
It's in the bylaws. Every member
of the fraternity is subject to review

1178
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:40,900
in every category,
including academics.

1179
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,900
Mitch, can you come here a second?
I don't mind popping for breakfast.

1180
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,600
I do speakers. I don't do tests.

1181
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:48,800
This is unbelievable.

1182
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:52,700
What happened to, "needing brotherhood
now more than ever?" They need us.

1183
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,800
Come on, college is
overrated anyway.

1184
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:58,200
I built Speaker City from the ground up.
I can barely read. Truth.

1185
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:02,300
This damn thing was your idea,
and you convinced me to do it,

1186
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:04,300
and now people's lives are ruined.

1187
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,800
Ruined? Like, whose life is ruined?

1188
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:09,000
Well, let's see.

1189
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,800
Blue's dead.

1190
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,800
Frank's divorced.

1191
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:16,700
I've lost my house.
Nicole thinks I'm a total jackass.

1192
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:21,100
And now we got nine kids who are gonna
get expelled from school,

1193
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:23,300
and you're not even gonna
help 'em out.

1194
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:41,300
Is this thing gonna go down smooth or
what? I'm missing 18 holes of golf here.

1195
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,200
One hundred percent.
I got creative with some of their tests.

1196
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:45,800
It should make for
a very entertaining day.

1197
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:48,500
I'm going to enjoy kicking
these assholes off campus.

1198
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,400
Ditto.

1199
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:54,800
Welcome, everyone, to the official
debate section of the charter review.

1200
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,400
Unfortunately,

1201
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:02,700
the captain of the university debate
team had a scheduling conflict. Yeah.

1202
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,500
So, we had to bring someone else in
to fill in for this event.

1203
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,800
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
the co-host of CNN's Crossfire,

1204
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:15,300
famed political consultant,
the Raging Cajun,

1205
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,100
Mr. James Carville.

1206
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:23,700
- Thank you.
- Don't clap.

1207
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:26,900
Thank you, Dean Pritchard.
It's an honor and pleasure to be here, sir.

1208
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,100
Topic number one.

1209
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:33,900
What is your position
on the role of government

1210
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,900
in supporting innovation
in the field of biotechnology?

1211
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:41,100
Well, Dean, I'm glad you
asked that question...

1212
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:44,300
I'd like to jump in and take that one,
Jimmy, if you don't mind.

1213
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,800
Have at it, hoss.

1214
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,800
Why doesn't he wait for an easy one?

1215
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,700
Recent research has shown
the empirical evidence

1216
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:02,400
for globalization of
corporate innovation is very limited.

1217
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:05,600
And as a corollary, the market
for technologies is shrinking.

1218
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:08,200
As a world leader,
it is important for America to provide

1219
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:10,400
systematic research grants
for our scientists.

1220
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:14,500
I believe there will always be a need for us
to have a well-articulated innovation policy

1221
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:17,800
with emphasis on
human resource development. Thank you.

1222
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:23,600
Where'd that come from?

1223
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,300
What happened? I blacked out.

1224
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:26,900
It was awesome.

1225
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,800
That was interesting.
Thank you very much.

1226
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:33,100
And your rebuttal,
Mr. Carville?

1227
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:37,200
We have no response.

1228
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,500
That was perfect.

1229
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:46,100
That's the way you do it!
That's the way you debate.

1230
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,000
Number 12.

1231
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:03,200
Which of the following is
a generally accepted graphical technique

1232
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:06,700
for determining first order
system parameters?

1233
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:11,800
Is it, A, Harriot's method
of solving cubics?

1234
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:15,200
B, Pythagorean triplets?

1235
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:19,400
Or C, the migration method of graphing
quadratic functions?

1236
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,400
Harriot's method of solving cubics.

1237
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:27,500
The answer is A, Harriot's method
of solving cubics.

1238
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,400
Good test.

1239
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,900
All right, Frank. Let's do this.

1240
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,400
Go Harrison!

1241
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:30,900
- Yes!
- Wow.

1242
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Go, Cougars!

1243
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,200
Oh, no!

1244
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:50,900
Help me! Help me!

1245
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:57,100
Dean Pritchard,
can I talk to you for a second?

1246
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:58,800
Megan, I'm a little busy.

1247
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:01,500
I didn't get into
Columbia Law School.

1248
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:03,100
How awful.

1249
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:06,300
You said if I revoked their charter,
you'd get me into Columbia.

1250
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,500
You're right, I did say that.

1251
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:09,600
No one at Columbia
has even heard of you.

1252
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:11,000
Oh, Megan.

1253
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:14,600
Look, I did my part.
Now you have to do yours.

1254
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:17,000
- That's how bribes work.
- I know how bribes work.

1255
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,500
I bribe people all the time,
but I changed my mind. It's a free country.

1256
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,700
Lesson learned.

1257
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:26,900
Damn it!

1258
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:31,800
Sorry, guys, I lost my composure out there.
I'm an idiot.

1259
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:35,200
Frankie, don't worry about it.
We'll make those points up, I promise you.

1260
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:37,500
- Your skin's gonna grow back, too.

1261
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,000
I'm sorry.

1262
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:41,300
Okay, how many events
do we actually have left here?

1263
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:45,000
One. Frank's accident
definitely set us back.

1264
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:49,000
But if we pass...
If we pass athletics, we're in.

1265
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:52,000
All right, everybody!
That's what I'm talking about, guys.

1266
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,500
We've made a great effort so far.
Let's just keep it up!

1267
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:58,400
That's right! We can't have anyone
freak out out there, okay?

1268
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:01,800
We've got to keep our composure!
We've come too far.

1269
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:05,100
There's too much to lose!
We've got to just keep our composure!

1270
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:09,400
For your final test, I've chosen the men's
gymnastics team's all- around competition.

1271
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:13,400
And participants in the three events
will be chosen at random by me,

1272
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:14,600
right now.

1273
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:17,000
Let's see, rings.

1274
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:18,500
Bernard.

1275
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:21,400
Okay, great.
Floor exercise.

1276
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:24,000
How about Frank? Great.

1277
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:29,400
And for the vault competition,
oh, I don't know...

1278
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:31,100
How about...

1279
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:34,500
- You.
- Me?

1280
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:37,200
Yeah. Is there a problem with that?

1281
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:20,300
I'm still holding.

1282
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,400
Still holding!

1283
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:28,700
It's physically impossible.

1284
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:32,100
Don't worry.
Abdul is there to spot you.

1285
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:37,900
We're waiting, gentlemen.

1286
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,800
Just hit the board as hard
as you can and shut your eyes.

1287
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:42,600
- You ready?
- Have fun with it.

1288
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:45,300
Go! Come on!

1289
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:53,300
Come on!

1290
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:09,700
Oh, my God! Yes!

1291
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:23,900
Hey, I did good.

1292
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:29,500
Congratulations, gentlemen.
You put forth quite an effort.

1293
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,800
You really did.

1294
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:34,000
But, I'm afraid
I have some bad news for you.

1295
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
You didn't pass your review.

1296
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:47,900
but unfortunately, another pledge of yours
scored a "0" in every category.

1297
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
What pledge?

1298
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:52,600
A Joseph "Blue" Pulasky.

1299
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:59,500
Hey, man, Blue's dead.
He passed away two weeks ago.

1300
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:02,000
He's listed right here
on your official chapter roster,

1301
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:08,500
Come on, you got to be kidding me.

1302
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:10,600
It's been quite a journey.

1303
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:14,400
You're gonna be all right.
You'll be all right, Frank.

1304
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:18,200
- Come on, now, big cat.
- I have no reason to live.

1305
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:20,500
We're gonna find you
a one-bedroom apartment,

1306
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:23,500
get you back on your feet,
maybe move you in over at Beanie's...

1307
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,200
It's not gonna be the same.

1308
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:27,800
Didn't quite work out
for you fellas, did it?

1309
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:30,700
You know what? I recommend
you drive off immediately,

1310
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:33,100
before something
extremely bad happens.

1311
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:34,900
- I'm scared.
- Excuse me, Mitch?

1312
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,200
Am I interrupting?

1313
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:39,600
Megan, you are. If you could leave,
it would be tremendous for all of us.

1314
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:42,200
I thought you guys might
find this interesting.

1315
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:45,800
You said if I revoked their charter,
you'd get me into Columbia.

1316
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:47,700
- I did say that.
- Look...

1317
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:51,200
I did my part, now you have to do yours.
That's how bribes work.

1318
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,900
I know how bribes work...

1319
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
You know what?
Just, let me...

1320
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,900
Bird-dog him, Frankie!

1321
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:02,000
Coming through!

1322
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:05,600
- Go that way!
- Slow down, man!

1323
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:12,900
Pritchard, hey, it's over.

1324
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:17,200
Hand over the tape. It's over.
It's over, okay?

1325
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:18,500
You know where the rest
of the guys are?

1326
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:21,500
I don't know, we all spread out...
Ow!

1327
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,100
What are you doing?
What are you...

1328
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,900
Time out. Time out.

1329
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,500
Excuse me! Excuse me!

1330
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,300
Gentlemen...
Oh, God!

1331
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:46,600
Wait, wait, my shoulder.

1332
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,500
This man accosted me!

1333
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:56,500
You are all witnesses!
He accosted me!

1334
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:58,500
- Frank!

1335
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:04,600
Frank, are you okay?

1336
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:08,200
Mitch, I'm so cold.

1337
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:12,700
Come on, big cat.

1338
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:14,700
I think I see Blue.

1339
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,600
He looks glorious.

1340
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:20,100
- Stay with me.
- Okay.

1341
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:22,700
I did good.

1342
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:26,000
You did great.

1343
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,100
Hi.

1344
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:02,300
Hey! Wow...

1345
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:04,700
How are you?

1346
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,100
I'm okay.

1347
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:08,200
You know, I got that apartment.

1348
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:10,500
Good for you. That's great.

1349
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:13,100
And you were right about Mark.

1350
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:14,500
What happened?

1351
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:19,000
Let's just say I caught him red-handed
and it wasn't pretty.

1352
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:22,600
I guess I thought he could change,
you know?

1353
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,000
I don't know.

1354
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,700
So, you're moving out?

1355
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,700
Yeah, I'm moving into a new place,

1356
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:33,700
far, far away from here.

1357
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,800
What about your little fraternity?

1358
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:39,600
Well, they're upgrading,
moving into a new facility.

1359
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:42,100
And to tell you the truth,

1360
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:45,400
they don't have much use for
the Godfather anymore.

1361
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:50,900
I hope you'll still think I'm cool
even without all this.

1362
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
I think I can deal with it.

1363
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:54,700
I appreciate it.

1364
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:57,700
Although, you know,
I have to say,

1365
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:02,400
I have always been a little curious
about what goes on inside these places.

1366
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,000
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1367
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:09,900
I do have another 12 hours
on my lease.

1368
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:13,800
I'd be more than happy to
show you around.

1369
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:15,100
Really?

1370
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,400
Yeah.

1371
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:18,900
Maybe for a minute.

1372
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,000
Great.

1373
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,400
Happy Tuesday to you out there.

1374
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:27,100
It's "Frank the Tank" here at
Harrison Cougar Radio, 88.6.

1375
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:30,000
Wanna give a shout-out
to the Godfather.

1376
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:33,000
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't be here today, Mitch.

1377
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:34,900
I'd probably be dead.

1378
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,300
Face down in
a drained pool somewhere.

1379
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,900
A quick note to all you
future brothers out there,

1380
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:46,300
brand-new house on campus, located
at Dean Pritchard's former residence.

1381
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:49,000
You all remember that crazy bastard.

1382
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:53,600
We'd love for you to join us
this Saturday at our open house

1383
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:57,700
for some chips, soda,
and some late-night streaking.

1384
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:00,300
Little right. Little more.

1385
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,000
Yeah, that's good enough.
That's good enough.

1386
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,700
- Welcome aboard, Booker.
- Thank you, sir.

1387
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:08,200
- Walsh. Well done.
- Frank the Tank.

1388
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:10,100
Why don't you get me
a fresh beer?

1389
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:11,400
You serious?

1390
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:12,600
Now!

1391
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,300
Now! Hurry, you sorry son-of-a-bitch!

1392
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:21,800
I've ever known

1393
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:27,400
To walk alone

1394
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:48,500
Aahh!

1395
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:51,800
Oh, shit.

1396
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:12,300
And the moment's gone

1397
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:22,000
A curiosity

1398
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:30,800
Dust in the wind

1399
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:33,100
Stay in the goal.

1400
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:35,600
We gotta stay in the goal.
You can't be walking around.

1401
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,900
You're killing me.
Can we stay between the posts?

1402
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,500
I want focus, I want intensity,
and I want "1,2,3"!

1403
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:42,700
Woofers!

1404
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:46,700
Go, go, go, eat 'em up!
Hungry! Eat 'em up!

1405
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:50,800
Caleb, you know what to do in the box.
We talked about it, in the box!

1406
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:52,900
Chill out, we're up by six.

1407
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:57,700
That ref'ss a real prick out there.
That's right, you heard me, my man!

1408
01:28:57,700 --> 01:29:01,500
Number four's been throwing elbows,
and someone's kid's gonna get hurt.

1409
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:03,000
What?

1410
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:04,900
Let's make it official then, jackass!

1411
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,800
Let's make it official!

1412
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:10,700
Get the clipboard.
I'll be in the car, all right?

1413
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:12,800
- Have some respect for yourself.
- Thank you.

1414
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:16,500
Is that Frank the Tank?

1415
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:18,700
Hey. Heidi.

1416
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:22,500
- How you doing?
- I'm doing really good.

1417
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:25,400
I got into body painting.

1418
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:27,300
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

1419
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:28,400
That's great.

1420
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:31,200
Well, you're looking
very healthy.

1421
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:34,500
Oh, thanks.
Yeah, so are you.

1422
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:36,600
Oh, thank you.

1423
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:40,000
So, I heard you and Marissa
split up. Is that true?

1424
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:41,900
Yeah, we did.

1425
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:44,600
You poor baby.

1426
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:47,000
You know, I'm having
this get-together

1427
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,600
at my place
tomorrow night.

1428
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:52,500
Like a few Internet friends.
You should swing by.

1429
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,600
- Really?
- Totally.

1430
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:56,900
- Okay.
- All right.

1431
01:29:56,900 --> 01:30:00,100
- That sounds awesome.
- See you tomorrow night.

1432
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:04,300
Awesome.

1433
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:05,800
Yes!

1434
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:10,600
I am back!
