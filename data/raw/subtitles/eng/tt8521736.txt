1
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,038
The Silver Surfer.

2
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:43,085
He first appeared with the Fantastic Four
and can travel at the speed of light.

3
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:47,923
And, somehow, nobody seems
to notice that he is completely naked.

4
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:53,428
Wolverine, a mutant
with superhuman strength

5
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:57,474
who can heal himself
and take down any villain.

6
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,434
He just shouldn't pick his nose.

7
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,565
And Incandesto, my dad's perfect creation.

8
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:07,901
He can shine
with the light of a thousand suns

9
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:12,155
and rescue any soul
from the darkness of despair.

10
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:17,369
However different they are,
all superheroes come to us with a purpose,

11
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,663
to save those in need.

12
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,958
To stand watch when danger closes in.

13
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,252
But they have one thing in common.

14
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,798
They never show up in the real world.

15
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,844
Oh, boy. What now, Flora?

16
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,555
They're in mint condition.

17
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:40,475
I keep them in protective sleeves
and try not to breathe when reading them.

18
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,020
Sellin' your whole collection?

19
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,985
If you ask me,
great art belongs to the world.

20
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,155
I didn't. 'Cause I own a comic book store.
And you're eight.

21
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,240
- Ten.
- What, inches tall?

22
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:58,160
Look, I can take these
to the store down the street.

23
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:02,497
Yeah, all right.

24
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,459
Let's see here, what do we got?

25
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:08,545
Wait.

26
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:10,506
Not that one.

27
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:14,343
All right, I'll give you
30 bucks for everything.

28
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:18,680
- Thirty? You barely even looked at them.
- Yeah, because I got a tournament to host.

29
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:21,141
You think these guys
have been sittin' here for 16 hours

30
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:23,435
so that I can sit here
talkin' to Flora the Explorer?

31
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:24,978
Some of these are worth that alone.

32
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,480
Can you just go back through them?

33
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,066
- I'll wait.
- I know you will.

34
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,319
Hey, watch it. Oh! Hey... Oh, come on!

35
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,286
Epic fail.

36
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,038
Uh...

37
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:44,957
Thirty sounds good.

38
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,792
Yeah, 30 sounds great.

39
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,880
Some would still believe
life is a comic book

40
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,341
filled with wonder,

41
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,802
where miraculous things happen.

42
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,055
Where families stay together.

43
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:03,976
But I am a cynic,

44
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:09,439
and a cynic knows
that superheroes are only in your head.

45
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:11,400
Looks like fun.

46
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,195
Not for me.
I've more serious matters to attend to.

47
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:18,198
Oh, right. Me, too.
The righteous never rest.

48
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,077
The danger is what's real.

49
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,745
Heads up!

50
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,582
That girl just ate it.

51
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,377
Not that
it's easy to let go of hope.

52
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,630
Flora, are you reading
the books I bought you?

53
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:34,756
Yep!

54
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,510
Remember our contract.

55
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,055
Cynics live in defiance of contracts.

56
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,641
What? Cynics invented contracts.

57
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,859
- See? So much better than comic books.
- Mmm-hmm.

58
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,403
Come downstairs,
I wanna show you something.

59
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,534
So what do you think
about the new addition?

60
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,828
Nothing in here looks new.

61
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,581
Old is the new new.
I keep telling you that.

62
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,499
I thought you were talking about being 40.

63
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,709
I'm 36.

64
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,461
- Sure.
- So what do you think?

65
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:15,422
About you being 36? Skeptical.

66
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:16,673
About this.

67
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,427
Wow, you replaced
your computer with a typewriter?

68
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:21,553
Yeah.

69
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:23,388
It's gonna be hard to get on the Internet.

70
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,307
Exactly. That's the whole point.

71
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,268
My next novel is set in the 1920s,

72
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:32,105
so this is gonna get me
to tap into the language.

73
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,566
Except for the "J" key,
'cause the "J" key doesn't work.

74
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,696
My mother is a romance novelist.

75
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,991
She said her books
were about superheroes too.

76
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:47,621
But their superpower was something
I wasn't old enough to know about yet.

77
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,546
She wrote about love because she had love.

78
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:58,382
We all did.

79
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,596
But ever since Dad moved out,
she couldn't write anything.

80
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:07,808
I think maybe Dad was her "J" key.

81
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,646
You know what? I'll just write in the "J."

82
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,650
Heel! Heel! Heel!

83
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,653
- Heel! Oh, no!
- Searching.

84
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,321
Help! Help!

85
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,407
Runaway vacuum! Stop.

86
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,950
- Bad robot. Stop!
- Searching.

87
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,702
Holy Bagumba.

88
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:28,829
I know. It's good, right?

89
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,539
Sit! You sit!

90
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,250
No, it's terrible.

91
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,752
Boundary. Boundary.

92
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,963
- I can help!
- Helping.

93
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,214
You got nowhere to go.

94
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:41,091
You're surrounded by boundaries.

95
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,552
Evolving.

96
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,972
- It's evolving.
- I got it!

97
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,348
Evolving.

98
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:49,766
- Come on.
- Evolving.

99
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,064
I got it. I got it. No, I don't.

100
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,483
Archie, look out!

101
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,623
Trash.

102
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,002
- Trash. Trash.
- No!

103
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,671
Oh!

104
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:23,008
Canister full.

105
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:49,409
No...

106
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,793
If you're wondering
how a squirrel's mouth tastes,

107
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,754
it's exactly how you'd think.

108
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:03,882
Fuzzy, damp, and slightly nutty.

109
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:09,221
But Incandesto fights for the weak,
no matter how they taste.

110
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:12,599
And so would I.

111
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:16,520
Come on. Breathe.

112
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,323
Hello.

113
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,412
Why's he staring at us?

114
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,665
Maybe he's wondering
why we're staring at him.

115
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:38,834
Because he was just dead?

116
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,171
Tootie?
Did you turn on the Ulysses?

117
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:43,881
I spilled my Froot Loops again.

118
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,966
Ulysses.

119
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:12,284
My dad drew heroes
with powers you couldn't always see

120
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:18,165
until you needed help and realized
they were the only ones there.

121
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,834
Like the Mighty Condor.

122
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:25,631
Shobo the Homeless Warrior.

123
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:30,177
And, of course, the Amazing Incandesto.

124
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:34,765
They all had power and
purpose and courage.

125
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,772
But when my dad couldn't
get any of them published,

126
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,901
he lost his.

127
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:56,870
And even though my mom tried
to help him get his courage back,

128
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,334
there was nobody who could save him.

129
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:07,756
Hey, maybe the Mighty Condor
needs to be more hero-y.

130
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:09,716
How 'bout a cape?

131
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,845
Who am I kidding? I can't keep doin' this.

132
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:15,138
George,
capes could pay the mortgage.

133
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,686
There was nobody
who could save him.

134
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,440
And nobody who could save us.

135
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:31,655
Most kids would've hoped
for things to work out differently.

136
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,324
But cynics don't hope.

137
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:36,577
They see what's real.

138
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,750
You have to stay in here, okay?

139
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:47,212
If my mom finds you, she might think
you're a rat and hit you with a pan.

140
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:49,631
That's how I lost my hamster.

141
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,258
- Flora?
- I'm coming.

142
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,057
Ladies and gentlemen,

143
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:00,893
fax machines, calculators,

144
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:05,355
and all other outdated
technology is now 50 % off.

145
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:09,318
Outdated technology, 50 % off.

146
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:11,153
Pause.

147
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,654
Hey, Chad.

148
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:16,074
Quick thing. I'm gonna put on
my manager hat here for just one second.

149
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:19,244
I'm gonna need you to push
those extended warranties on the printers.

150
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:20,579
I always offer it to people,

151
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,207
but they ask if the printers break,
and they usually don't.

152
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,083
I'm gonna fast-forward this
to the end here.

153
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,836
Sell the warranties.

154
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,422
Yeah. I understand
the selling warranties part.

155
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:33,133
I don't quite understand
how you're controlling time

156
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:35,469
- with an invisible remote.
- Excuse me, sir?

157
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,055
You helped me so much
the last time I was here.

158
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,140
- I remember.
- I was wondering if...

159
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:41,600
I know you're his daughter.

160
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,310
Oh...

161
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,103
Back to work.

162
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:46,855
Is everything okay?

163
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:49,024
- Yeah. I saved a squirrel.
- What?

164
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,651
Do you remember how they explained

165
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,778
infant CPR
in Terrible Things Can Happen To You?

166
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,321
Chapter 12, Grave Mistakes.

167
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,950
Exactly. I just pretended
the squirrel was a furry little baby,

168
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:01,703
and it worked.
I named him Ulysses. This is for him.

169
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,497
Did you put your mouth on the squirrel?

170
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,082
- I had to.
- Was he clean?

171
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,166
Probably not.

172
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,543
Probably not or definitely not?

173
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:10,128
- Definitely not. But I had to.
- Correct. Right.

174
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:11,380
Can I just take these?

175
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,674
I'll take care of it.
Employees get 3 % off.

176
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:16,593
- Nice.
- Yeah, it's way better than healthcare.

177
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:19,346
So, I found a new publisher.

178
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,181
They mostly do online stuff,

179
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:24,059
but I think Incandesto
would be better on a computer.

180
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,602
'Cause he can light up.

181
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:27,646
You know, don't worry about it, okay?

182
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:30,190
I could submit it for you.

183
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:32,985
I just don't think
the world is ready for Incandesto.

184
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,447
- This thing broken?
- No. It's functioning.

185
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:40,909
'Kay, I'll see you tomorrow. 'Kay?

186
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:42,703
- Okay.
- Okay.

187
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:59,678
What's another word for "steamy"?
I've already used that three times.

188
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,306
Juicy.

189
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,557
Yeah, that's good.

190
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,186
What's another one?

191
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:09,146
Joyful.

192
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,106
Ha-ha, very funny.

193
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,650
"Steamy..."

194
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:20,449
I saw Dad.

195
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,076
Yeah?

196
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,912
He's really letting the beard go.

197
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,539
Like the guy in Electric Love.

198
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,671
Will you point the Jack and Rose at me?

199
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,089
I... I need their strength.

200
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:38,884
The Jack and Rose.

201
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:43,138
It was a prestigious award
from Romantic Living Magazine.

202
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:46,850
Because nothing says
"living" like the Titanic.

203
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:05,661
Ulysses, you have to be careful.

204
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,958
A body can only take so much trauma.

205
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:14,795
Unless you're Incandesto's alter-ego,
Alfred T. Slipper.

206
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,173
His trauma gave him power.

207
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:21,802
He was once an unassuming janitor

208
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:25,514
until he fell into a vat
of industrial cleaning solution.

209
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,183
Then he transformed.

210
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,688
Hey, you got sucked up by a vacuum.

211
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,857
Maybe you're a superhero.

212
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:54,459
Nah. You're just a nice squirrel.

213
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:56,587
Flora Belle,
can you come down for dinner?

214
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,838
It's from the microwave,

215
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,591
but I made it look
like it's from the oven.

216
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,467
I'm turning the oven on, so it feels real.

217
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:03,844
All right, Mom.

218
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,514
Be right down.

219
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:10,851
Want me to microwave the rolls,
so they're fresh from the oven?

220
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:14,479
Okay, I have to go. I'm gonna try
and bring you up some more food.

221
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:18,150
I can't promise you it'll be good
because I know it won't be.

222
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:56,271
Saving some for later. Looks so good.

223
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,315
So, I have some big news.

224
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,568
The Herald is doing
a piece on my next book!

225
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:03,153
Wow!

226
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:05,405
Yeah. In publishing,
they call that "trending."

227
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:06,740
People still read the newspaper?

228
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:09,826
Yes. You should, too.

229
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,745
It's not in my contract.

230
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,789
You live in defiance of contracts.

231
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:15,624
Right.

232
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:19,086
Hey, do you wanna go to the mall tomorrow?

233
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:22,714
We can get our hair done
at that place where they act all snooty,

234
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:25,217
even though they're right
next to the food court.

235
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,385
No, I'm good.

236
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,887
Flora, you can't spend
another summer alone.

237
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:30,347
You need friends.

238
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,557
Do you have friends?

239
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:35,686
I'm an artist. I suffer for my art.

240
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,737
The ghost babies were weird.

241
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:47,656
Mmm-hmm.

242
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,827
Flora!

243
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:19,206
What is this?

244
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:21,333
Your typewriter?

245
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:25,879
I know it's my typewriter.
I mean the paper in it.

246
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,006
"Squirtel.

247
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,426
"I am Ulysses. Born anew."

248
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:37,724
Holy unanticipated occurrences!

249
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:41,562
Flora, this isn't a joke.
This typewriter is for my work.

250
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:42,771
But I didn't...

251
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:46,066
And my cheese balls? The whole bag? God.

252
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,735
Now I can't eat my way out of sadness.

253
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:50,904
Unless I wanna lick
the cheese off the keys,

254
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:52,739
which, honestly, I'm considering doing.

255
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:55,617
God, think about that! How sad that is.

256
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,537
That is really sad.

257
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,998
- Can I keep this?
- No, I'm gonna publish it.

258
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,760
Did you type this?

259
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:21,602
"Do not hope. Observe."

260
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:23,979
Terrible Things Can Happen To You

261
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:28,233
made it very clear that hope
can get in the way of action.

262
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:33,280
A true cynic has no luxury for hope,
only observation.

263
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:37,451
Ulysses, can you understand me?

264
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:41,288
Holy Bagumba!

265
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:42,956
Can you talk?

266
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:48,754
Okay, that's not really talking,
but still.

267
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:53,300
I knew it.
The vacuum made you a superhero.

268
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:57,679
It sucked up an unassuming squirrel
and spit out a Ulysses.

269
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:02,267
I'm so glad I saved these
for an emergency.

270
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:06,188
Though, I told Mom I'd use them
to line the cage when I got a new hamster.

271
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:16,365
Now, the important thing
is to find your purpose.

272
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:20,702
Every superhero has
one true and unwavering purpose.

273
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,955
Usually it's liberty or freedom,

274
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:25,415
but it can also be revenge,
which is darker.

275
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:28,502
And you have to kill people,
and then regret it afterwards.

276
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,963
Usually by screaming at the sky.

277
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:32,881
Do you have any enemies?

278
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:42,391
Don't worry. It's usually a person.

279
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:46,311
Or a monster.
Or a monster that started as a person.

280
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:49,481
Superheroes can handle anything.

281
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:51,984
I can be your sidekick.

282
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:54,695
Incandesto has a parakeet named Dolores,

283
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:58,615
but you can have me.
I will help you find your purpose.

284
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:02,870
Flora, I think your dad is here.

285
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,914
Don't worry. Dad is one of us.

286
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:17,217
I wanna lick these keys.

287
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:22,764
Hello!

288
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:23,891
Mrs. Tickham?

289
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:26,059
And some Tootie Turnovers.

290
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:30,647
Hello! Friendly neighbor here.

291
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:34,151
Tootie. What a nice surprise.

292
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:38,071
Well, the world is full
of lots o' surprises these days.

293
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:40,616
William?

294
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:44,828
Sorry. So many wonderful smells outside.

295
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:46,830
Jasmine, I think.

296
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:48,457
We don't have any jasmine.

297
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,209
It could be up to a mile away.

298
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,461
This is my nephew, William Spiver.

299
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:54,171
He's spending the summer with us.

300
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:55,839
Pleased to meet you both.

301
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:57,925
Well, I assume there are two of you.

302
00:20:58,008 --> 00:21:01,678
Although, there could be
a third who hasn't talked.

303
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:04,223
A baby, perhaps.
I think I smell a baby.

304
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:05,474
There's no baby.

305
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:07,017
Could be up to a mile away.

306
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,186
William is suffering
from temporary blindness.

307
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,230
It's caused by stress.

308
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:12,898
Hysterical blindness, actually.

309
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:15,484
I've read about that
in Terrible Things Can Happen To You.

310
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,402
It's supposed to go away if you relax.

311
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:20,322
Squirrel!

312
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:21,657
There's a squirrel in here?

313
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,326
Where's my tennis racket?
I can get a clean shot!

314
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:26,036
- What?
- Gah! Come with me.

315
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,455
Ah! Yes, I'm getting him now.

316
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:31,416
Ulysses, you have to be more careful.

317
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,293
Danger lurks everywhere.

318
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:35,379
Especially where there's tennis rackets.

319
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:37,923
Are you talking to that squirrel?

320
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:39,675
Go away, you're trespassing.

321
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:42,344
It's only trespassing if a sign is posted

322
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:45,138
with letters measuring
no less than two inches in height.

323
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:48,100
Yep. There's one right here.

324
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:53,772
If you don't mind,
I have important things to do.

325
00:21:53,856 --> 00:21:55,774
Well, I don't have anything to do.

326
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,861
So, maybe I could be of assistance?

327
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:03,073
Do you mind if I feel your face?

328
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,408
So I know what you look like.

329
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:05,868
I guess.

330
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:11,790
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

331
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:17,421
Doesn't really work.
Just feels like a face.

332
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,674
Are your hands clean?

333
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:24,136
What happened to make you blind?

334
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:27,764
Why're you talking to a squirrel?

335
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:33,854
He's a superhero.

336
00:22:34,605 --> 00:22:36,023
What?

337
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:41,278
"I..."

338
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:42,696
It's just one letter.

339
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:47,659
"L, O, V..."

340
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:51,038
Uh, okay. He's going squirrel speed now.

341
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,711
"I love your round head.

342
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:01,173
"The brilliant green, the sky so new.

343
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:05,219
"These letters, this world, you.

344
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:07,596
"I am very, very hungry."

345
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:11,433
I told you. He types poetry.

346
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:13,143
Not great poetry, though.

347
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:14,353
He's a squirrel.

348
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:16,396
Fine. He's a poetry-typing squirrel.

349
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,689
Do you doubt him?

350
00:23:17,773 --> 00:23:20,609
Of course I doubt him.
What kind of superhero types poetry?

351
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:23,654
My dad's here! He'll know what to do.

352
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:25,739
Find your way out, William.

353
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:32,704
You don't have to ring the bell.

354
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:36,291
- But you do have to fix it.
- But I don't live here anymore.

355
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,377
- Which thing are you responding to?
- Ringing it.

356
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,837
So, you'll fix it.

357
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,007
Oh, I did fix it.
That's why it sounds that way.

358
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:47,553
- Hi. Oh!
- Hi.

359
00:23:47,636 --> 00:23:51,265
So, I was gonna give you a hug.
Yeah, just like an adult hug.

360
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,351
- Yeah.
- Great.

361
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:56,812
Where's Flora?

362
00:23:56,895 --> 00:23:58,856
Well, she ran off with a squirrel.

363
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:00,649
Hi, Dad. I just gotta run upstairs.

364
00:24:00,732 --> 00:24:02,693
- 'Kay.
- What's under your sweatshirt?

365
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:04,736
- Nothing.
- It's moving.

366
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:06,613
I'm pregnant?

367
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:09,741
- Is it the squirrel?
- Yes.

368
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:11,577
Flora. Flora!

369
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,497
Did you see that?
She's totally ignoring me.

370
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:17,291
She's never done that before.

371
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:18,792
I'm afraid it's drugs.

372
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:20,961
She's ten.

373
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:23,297
Will you just please help her?

374
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,508
I really need to focus on my book.
We need the income.

375
00:24:26,592 --> 00:24:30,095
I can't pay the mortgage
with your paperclip commissions.

376
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:31,388
Oh, we don't get commissions.

377
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:32,764
Yeah, it's a metaphor.

378
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:34,349
I don't think that's a metaphor.

379
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:36,101
Okay, you know what? I'm a novelist.

380
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:37,895
- I know what a metaphor is.
- Right.

381
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:41,773
Will you just put the squirrel in that
and just get rid of it?

382
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:46,987
He's probably diseased, honey.

383
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,823
Squirrels are the most diseased
of any rodent.

384
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:50,949
I think that's rats.

385
00:24:52,576 --> 00:24:54,995
I wrote all of these books,
George. All of them.

386
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:56,163
Mmm-hmm.

387
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:05,339
I guess
we need to find another yard.

388
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:06,590
Yeah.

389
00:25:11,803 --> 00:25:15,390
He's not just a squirrel, Dad.
He's got powers.

390
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:18,727
He's been transformed
like Alfred T. Slipper.

391
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:22,022
Okay.

392
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:24,816
That's it?

393
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,193
That's what?

394
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:27,945
This squirrel is a superhero.

395
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:30,364
The universe sent him for a reason.

396
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:33,992
Stop it. Stop it.

397
00:25:34,535 --> 00:25:37,955
He's just exploring his powers.
All superheroes do.

398
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:40,791
Flora, I used to think
that life was a comic book, too.

399
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:44,419
Full of magic and wonder, but it's not.

400
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:46,421
There is no magic.

401
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:50,342
We just want there to be
so the world doesn't feel so hopeless.

402
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:53,053
But Incandesto says...

403
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:54,972
Incandesto's a drawing, honey.

404
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:57,349
All superheroes are.

405
00:26:00,978 --> 00:26:03,730
Our lives used to be full of magic.

406
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:29,089
Are you getting divorced?

407
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,845
No, we're just tryin'
to figure things out.

408
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:39,308
Yeah.

409
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:50,277
Hey, who's hungry?

410
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,528
Oh, donuts.

411
00:26:58,327 --> 00:27:01,788
You know, I don't think you're supposed
to bring a squirrel to a restaurant.

412
00:27:03,749 --> 00:27:06,501
Unless it's like a seeing-eye squirrel
or something like that.

413
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:08,670
He'll stay in the box.

414
00:27:08,754 --> 00:27:10,797
- He's trained?
- He's a superhero.

415
00:27:10,881 --> 00:27:14,092
- Right.
- Hi. I'm Rita. You ready to order?

416
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:15,260
I'm not hungry.

417
00:27:15,344 --> 00:27:19,806
Okay, well, I am. I'm starving.
I will have an omelet...

418
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,308
I'll have a donut.

419
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:22,726
- One donut.
- I will have an...

420
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,686
- Two donuts.
- Two donuts?

421
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:25,771
Two donuts.

422
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:28,607
- I'll have an omelet, please, with...
- Uh, three donuts.

423
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:32,402
- I'd like an omelet, please, with bacon...
- Six donuts? Please.

424
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:34,738
Is your mom feeding you?

425
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:38,408
Hey. What do you have in there?
Is it a little kitty or something?

426
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:40,244
No. It's just a box.

427
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:43,205
Come on. Just a little kitty, right?
Can I just...

428
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:45,791
I just wanna see the little fuzzball.
Is it cute?

429
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:47,125
- Here, kitty...
- No!

430
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:53,465
There's always that moment
in any origin story

431
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:58,470
where the hero awakens,
embraces his identity,

432
00:27:58,554 --> 00:28:01,265
and unleashes the full breadth of his...

433
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:04,768
That moment was not now.

434
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:06,645
Not another infestation.

435
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,481
Ulysses, forget the donuts!

436
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:22,286
Squirrel! Aah! Get it off!

437
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:23,829
Just stay calm, he's friendly!

438
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:28,041
Squirrel! Squirrel!

439
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:31,378
Look out!

440
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:33,881
Ulysses! No!

441
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:37,509
Remember who you are, Ulysses!

442
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:58,113
Is he...

443
00:28:58,864 --> 00:28:59,865
He is.

444
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:05,037
Oh...

445
00:29:27,184 --> 00:29:29,811
- Flora! Flora! Hey, hey, hey!
- Ulysses, get out of there!

446
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:36,151
Ulysses.

447
00:29:36,235 --> 00:29:37,319
No, no, get back.

448
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,413
We should leave.

449
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:49,581
Yup.

450
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:52,918
Here we go.

451
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:01,552
Holy Bagumba.

452
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:08,392
Holy, holy Bagumba. He flew!

453
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:10,143
Yes. Across the whole restaurant.

454
00:30:10,227 --> 00:30:12,729
- Yes!
- I told you he's a superhero.

455
00:30:12,813 --> 00:30:14,690
And he's not floating. He's actually...

456
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:16,859
- He's flying.
- He's picking a destination

457
00:30:16,942 --> 00:30:18,277
- and he's landing there.
- Yes.

458
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,154
All right, because I have
a light bulb in my apartment

459
00:30:21,238 --> 00:30:23,156
that I can't quite get,
'cause it's too high.

460
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,825
Do you think he can twist it out?

461
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:26,118
- Yeah.
- Okay.

462
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:27,828
I have always wanted to fly like that.

463
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:33,625
Oh, boy!

464
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:34,877
Is he okay?

465
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,545
I think he might need a doctor.

466
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:38,839
Okay, there's a doctor in Apartment Six.

467
00:30:38,922 --> 00:30:42,092
We had to find a place
to keep Ulysses safe.

468
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:45,095
Dad's apartment
wasn't a typical superhero lair,

469
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:48,432
since it wasn't built into a mountain
or in a frozen tundra

470
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:50,559
where your ghost father gave you advice.

471
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:52,269
But it did have a pool.

472
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:54,605
I think he might have a concussion.

473
00:30:54,688 --> 00:30:57,983
Keep your voice down. It's watching us.

474
00:30:58,066 --> 00:31:02,487
It also has a psychotic cat
named Mr. Klaus.

475
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,533
Very slowly.

476
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:16,919
Here we go. Here we go,
here we go, here we go. We're safe.

477
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:26,261
Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go!

478
00:31:26,345 --> 00:31:28,096
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

479
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,556
Dad! Hurry! Come on!

480
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,683
I can't get it to work!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

481
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:33,101
Get in, get in, get in!

482
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:41,193
Okay. We survived.

483
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:45,656
What was wrong with that thing?

484
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:47,324
I don't think cats like to be groomed.

485
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:50,244
They're self-groomers, you take
that away from 'em, they got nothin'.

486
00:31:50,327 --> 00:31:52,704
- It looked like a furry dumbbell.
- It did.

487
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:55,666
Go, go, go! It's the cat! It's the cat!

488
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,018
I'm here about the squirrel.

489
00:32:15,936 --> 00:32:16,937
Oh.

490
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,656
Uh...

491
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,910
Mr. Buckman, how nice to see you. Come in.

492
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:35,205
He looks good, right?

493
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:47,593
In my philosophical opinion,
this squirrel is just fine.

494
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:51,597
You feel okay, Ulysses?

495
00:32:53,891 --> 00:32:55,475
He has the power to understand?

496
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:00,105
And we can't return him to the wild.

497
00:33:00,189 --> 00:33:03,358
He's here for a reason,
and we're going to help him find it.

498
00:33:03,442 --> 00:33:05,110
I thought a squirrel

499
00:33:05,194 --> 00:33:07,112
stealing from
my bird feeder was impressive.

500
00:33:07,196 --> 00:33:08,447
Hey, look!

501
00:33:10,032 --> 00:33:12,326
Okay, it feels superhero-y.

502
00:33:14,578 --> 00:33:18,123
"Forever and wanting is stomach"?

503
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:21,293
It's poetry. He's a great poet.

504
00:33:22,252 --> 00:33:23,837
Or he's hungry.

505
00:33:27,716 --> 00:33:29,676
And then it just, whoosh, took off.

506
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,720
Squirrels don't fly.
They leap great distances.

507
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:32,971
Not this one.

508
00:33:33,055 --> 00:33:34,806
So, it was with a little girl?

509
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,767
Yeah, and her dad. It was her pet.

510
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,477
Squirrels can't be domesticated.

511
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,854
They can be docile enough
to handle if they're diseased.

512
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:42,189
- Rabies?
- I didn't say that.

513
00:33:42,272 --> 00:33:44,107
- But it's rabies? Oh, its rabies.
- It might be.

514
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:46,610
Definitely. But don't worry about it.
I trained for this.

515
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:49,947
I think like a squirrel,
and it's my job to keep this town safe.

516
00:33:56,662 --> 00:33:58,330
He's asleep.

517
00:33:58,413 --> 00:34:00,832
Long day. Even for a superhero.

518
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:02,334
Flora?

519
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:04,378
Hey. That's William Spiver.

520
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:05,879
George Buckman. How do you do?

521
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:10,384
Don't worry. Nothing broken.

522
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:12,094
He's hysterically blind.

523
00:34:12,177 --> 00:34:13,262
He's what?

524
00:34:13,345 --> 00:34:14,888
Nice to meet you, sir.

525
00:34:14,972 --> 00:34:16,348
Nice to meet you.

526
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:18,642
Yeah, I'll come to you. Sure.

527
00:34:19,393 --> 00:34:20,477
- How are ya?
- Good.

528
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:22,771
- Do you still have the squirrel?
- For now.

529
00:34:22,855 --> 00:34:25,899
Okay. We need to hide him in a place
that your mom will never look.

530
00:34:25,983 --> 00:34:29,069
What about my tree house?
She always says she can't look at that.

531
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:31,738
Yes, Terrible Things says
that best way to avoid detection

532
00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:33,198
is by using an alternate route,

533
00:34:33,282 --> 00:34:35,367
or by curling into a ball
and just screaming.

534
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,785
That's for mountain lions.

535
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:39,079
- It applies here, too.
- George!

536
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:40,914
No. Okay, all right,
everybody act natural.

537
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:42,708
Very natural and calm. And here we go.

538
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:45,002
There you are.

539
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:46,587
Didn't know you guys were back.

540
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,796
We're not.

541
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:49,715
What?

542
00:34:50,299 --> 00:34:52,217
I'm so sorry. I'm not good under pressure.

543
00:34:52,301 --> 00:34:53,510
Did you get rid of the...

544
00:34:53,594 --> 00:34:54,887
Wasps? Oh, you got it.

545
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:56,305
Wait, we have wasps?

546
00:34:56,388 --> 00:34:59,308
Right, she's, um, talking about the...

547
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:01,977
The squirrel. He's gone.

548
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:06,064
Exactly. So, I guess we're all set,
and there's nothin' to worry about.

549
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:09,568
You're so weird.

550
00:35:13,322 --> 00:35:15,032
We nailed that.

551
00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:17,868
We absolutely nailed that.

552
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:19,703
Anything she threw at us, we nailed it.

553
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:22,873
All right, okay. I gotta go to work.
Got the restocking shift tonight.

554
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:25,834
- Okay. I'll keep him safe.
- Yeah, I know you will.

555
00:35:27,169 --> 00:35:28,337
Dad?

556
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:33,258
You know how in Terrible Things
it says, "Do not hope, only observe"?

557
00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:37,304
Maybe it's okay to hope.

558
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:49,233
There was a superhero in our midst.

559
00:35:50,484 --> 00:35:53,278
We had yet to learn his purpose,

560
00:35:53,946 --> 00:35:55,572
or his style.

561
00:35:55,656 --> 00:35:58,075
But we knew how he made us feel.

562
00:35:58,158 --> 00:36:00,869
Last time on
our squirrels of Beverly Hills...

563
00:36:00,953 --> 00:36:03,580
That maybe
there was light in the darkness...

564
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:04,831
You look like a chipmunk!

565
00:36:04,915 --> 00:36:08,627
...and maybe the best part
of having a superhero around

566
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,171
is how you start to feel like one, too.

567
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:39,611
Squirrels.

568
00:38:42,406 --> 00:38:44,032
Hmm.

569
00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:52,124
I'm better than a squirrel.

570
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:26,325
It's called a Pop-Tart.

571
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,162
It's kinda like a donut
that got run over by a car.

572
00:39:30,245 --> 00:39:31,288
Flora?

573
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:33,248
Ever heard of knocking?

574
00:39:34,082 --> 00:39:37,336
Sorry. I heard your voice from my yard.

575
00:39:37,419 --> 00:39:39,963
My blindness gives me
a more advanced sense of hearing.

576
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:41,215
I'm over here.

577
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:43,133
Oh...

578
00:39:43,217 --> 00:39:46,512
And, by the way, you almost
knocked down Ulysses' Pop-Tart.

579
00:39:49,014 --> 00:39:50,182
Make yourself at home.

580
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:53,060
Thank you. I'm sent here
for the entire summer,

581
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:55,562
but nobody really planned
anything for me to do.

582
00:39:56,855 --> 00:39:58,315
Why were you sent away?

583
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:00,442
Uh...

584
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:03,987
Anyway, I, um, brought him this.

585
00:40:04,071 --> 00:40:07,449
It's Rilke.
My father would read this to me.

586
00:40:08,325 --> 00:40:11,453
"You,
sent out beyond your recall.

587
00:40:11,537 --> 00:40:15,290
"Flare up like a flame
and make big shadows I can move in."

588
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,709
"Flare up like a flame."

589
00:40:18,377 --> 00:40:20,170
Hear that, Ulysses?

590
00:40:20,254 --> 00:40:22,589
Flare up like a flame
and find your purpose.

591
00:40:23,757 --> 00:40:24,800
He has a purpose?

592
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:27,094
Every superhero has a purpose.

593
00:40:29,221 --> 00:40:33,642
I'm sorry, but I don't think
your squirrel is a superhero.

594
00:40:33,725 --> 00:40:35,561
He may be very special,

595
00:40:35,644 --> 00:40:38,063
and he knows how to type. But if you...

596
00:40:38,146 --> 00:40:39,773
William!

597
00:40:42,651 --> 00:40:43,944
Holy Bagumba.

598
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,321
"Flare up like a flame."

599
00:40:49,992 --> 00:40:51,451
Hello?

600
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:58,625
Nothing broken. Is the Pop-Tart okay?

601
00:41:02,337 --> 00:41:07,176
The universe was expanding,
but it didn't feel any scarier.

602
00:41:07,843 --> 00:41:10,387
It felt like it was just making room.

603
00:41:18,937 --> 00:41:21,023
Uh, we called George in, sir.

604
00:41:21,106 --> 00:41:23,775
This is comin' out of his check,
I can tell you that.

605
00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:25,777
How many boxes of pushpins is this?

606
00:41:27,279 --> 00:41:28,655
Probably 15.

607
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:29,948
And how much is a box?

608
00:41:30,032 --> 00:41:31,533
On sale for 39ยข.

609
00:41:32,034 --> 00:41:33,368
That's...

610
00:41:34,703 --> 00:41:36,371
Definitely comin' out of his check.

611
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:40,209
Five dollars out of his check.

612
00:41:41,043 --> 00:41:42,794
Just pretend you're in a tree.

613
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,216
- Let's go, William.
- Where are we?

614
00:41:48,258 --> 00:41:53,096
Comic Cave. We have to prepare Ulysses
for a more dangerous world.

615
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,933
Good plan,
but it doesn't seem that dangerous.

616
00:41:58,769 --> 00:42:00,145
Look who it is.

617
00:42:00,896 --> 00:42:03,482
You know, the gamers
named a monster after ya.

618
00:42:03,565 --> 00:42:05,442
Its specialty is making grown men cry.

619
00:42:05,526 --> 00:42:07,736
I'm here on superhero-related business.

620
00:42:07,819 --> 00:42:09,696
If you're gonna
bad-mouth Spider-Man again,

621
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,657
I'm not havin' it.
I'll close this place down.

622
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,909
All I said
was that Incandesto can beat him.

623
00:42:13,992 --> 00:42:16,036
With light? Are you crazy?

624
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:17,788
The light of a thousand suns.

625
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:20,415
Throw Spider-Man into the sun
and see how he feels.

626
00:42:20,499 --> 00:42:23,168
The sun is 27 million degrees.

627
00:42:23,835 --> 00:42:25,462
It's pretty hot for a guy in jammies.

628
00:42:25,546 --> 00:42:27,214
That's true. Didn't think of that.

629
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:30,467
Hey. What's his deal?

630
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:32,094
I'm hysterically blind.

631
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:33,846
Would you mind if I felt your face?

632
00:42:33,929 --> 00:42:34,930
Yes.

633
00:42:35,013 --> 00:42:39,017
Fair enough. I will attempt to read
your features using echolocation.

634
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:47,401
What do you guys want?

635
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:49,736
Do you have anything
on superhero training?

636
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,572
Specifically, small furry mammals?

637
00:42:51,655 --> 00:42:53,657
- No.
- Then just regular superheroes?

638
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,742
- No.
- Superhero purpose discovery?

639
00:42:55,826 --> 00:42:58,161
- Nope.
- Being a Superhero for Dummies?

640
00:42:58,412 --> 00:42:59,997
Not really a self-help genre.

641
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,123
Flora, over here.

642
00:43:01,206 --> 00:43:03,959
Animal Control
is on the scene investigating.

643
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:06,628
But, Rita, what did they tell you
about the attack?

644
00:43:06,712 --> 00:43:08,714
They said
it was definitely rabies.

645
00:43:08,797 --> 00:43:10,841
And it was in my hair,
trying to give me rabies.

646
00:43:10,924 --> 00:43:12,259
And did it look diseased?

647
00:43:12,342 --> 00:43:14,553
Yes, it was covered in rabies.

648
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:17,598
Wow. Well, let's hope
they capture this squirrel

649
00:43:17,681 --> 00:43:20,976
before the disease spreads
to our pets and our children.

650
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:22,853
Oh, no.

651
00:43:22,936 --> 00:43:24,188
He's a fugitive.

652
00:43:24,271 --> 00:43:26,607
- We've gotta get to Dad!
- Oh!

653
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,233
What are those? Pushpins?

654
00:43:28,734 --> 00:43:31,570
I love it. I want him
to do that in all my stores.

655
00:43:31,653 --> 00:43:32,863
Really?

656
00:43:32,946 --> 00:43:34,948
You know how many people
have Instagrammed this?

657
00:43:35,032 --> 00:43:37,367
That's free advertising, Chad.
Hashtag, money.

658
00:43:37,451 --> 00:43:39,286
You know, that's exactly what I said.

659
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:41,747
Hashtag, my idea.

660
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:44,416
Oh, hey, there he is.
George. George. My man.

661
00:43:44,499 --> 00:43:45,584
- Your man?
- Yeah.

662
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:46,919
Listen, I need you to make me

663
00:43:47,002 --> 00:43:48,879
- another one of those signs, like now.
- Dad!

664
00:43:48,962 --> 00:43:51,173
- What's wrong?
- They're after Ulysses.

665
00:43:51,256 --> 00:43:52,841
- We gotta go. Come on.
- Whoa, pause.

666
00:43:52,925 --> 00:43:54,843
You're still on the schedule.
I need your help.

667
00:43:54,927 --> 00:43:56,261
- You got...
- I can't. Okay?

668
00:43:56,345 --> 00:43:58,597
You have to. You're scheduled.
That means that you...

669
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,098
Then I quit!

670
00:44:03,852 --> 00:44:04,853
Nice!

671
00:44:05,604 --> 00:44:06,897
Yeah. I quit.

672
00:44:07,731 --> 00:44:09,858
Oh, it feels so good!

673
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:17,950
- You know...
- Pause.

674
00:44:19,284 --> 00:44:20,369
You're fired.

675
00:44:20,953 --> 00:44:21,954
Yes.

676
00:44:22,538 --> 00:44:24,164
Here we go,
here we go, here we go!

677
00:44:24,248 --> 00:44:25,707
- Hurry.
- Seat belts.

678
00:44:28,627 --> 00:44:30,003
Okay, here we go.

679
00:44:32,172 --> 00:44:34,258
- That's my bad. I popped the clutch.
- Dad?

680
00:44:34,341 --> 00:44:36,927
Give me a second.
Here I go, and I'm goin' in first now.

681
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:39,054
- I'm goin'...
- I have sensitive hearing!

682
00:44:39,137 --> 00:44:40,848
- Go!
- It is my first stick-shift.

683
00:44:40,931 --> 00:44:42,224
- Hurry!
- Get ready.

684
00:44:42,307 --> 00:44:43,392
- Yes.
- Finally!

685
00:44:43,475 --> 00:44:45,060
And, baby, here we vroom!

686
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:47,479
Well?

687
00:44:47,563 --> 00:44:48,856
Loving the Victrola.

688
00:44:48,939 --> 00:44:53,443
Right? And then, I'm gonna tell
the reporter that romance is timeless,

689
00:44:53,527 --> 00:44:56,405
and I'm gonna move around the room
with my eyes closed...

690
00:44:56,488 --> 00:44:58,490
- That's really good.
- Yeah.

691
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:02,744
Oh, sorry, it's on shuffle.

692
00:45:06,915 --> 00:45:07,916
Dang it!

693
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:14,006
I'm also gonna put out some Hickory Farms.

694
00:45:14,756 --> 00:45:15,757
Are you okay?

695
00:45:15,841 --> 00:45:16,842
Yes.

696
00:45:16,925 --> 00:45:18,343
No.

697
00:45:18,427 --> 00:45:21,305
This interview
is so important for us.

698
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:24,433
But I am circling
failure's neighborhood...

699
00:45:24,516 --> 00:45:28,020
- Can I talk to you as a friend?
- Yeah. An editor would've left by now.

700
00:45:28,103 --> 00:45:30,564
- You're about to be a failure.
- Really?

701
00:45:30,647 --> 00:45:32,274
I'm talking to you as an editor now.

702
00:45:32,357 --> 00:45:34,401
Oh, yeah, a friend would've left by now.

703
00:45:34,484 --> 00:45:37,321
Phyllis, you've blocked
everyone out to succeed,

704
00:45:37,404 --> 00:45:39,114
but you blocked yourself out, too.

705
00:45:39,198 --> 00:45:41,992
Writing used to
come easy for you, remember?

706
00:45:42,075 --> 00:45:43,827
Let people back in.

707
00:45:43,911 --> 00:45:46,121
Because then maybe
something will go right.

708
00:45:47,122 --> 00:45:48,749
And you need this to go right.

709
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:52,085
You can't sell a book without good press.

710
00:45:53,921 --> 00:45:55,380
I need good press.

711
00:45:55,464 --> 00:45:57,424
Hmm?

712
00:46:01,845 --> 00:46:02,846
No.

713
00:46:03,514 --> 00:46:04,515
No.

714
00:46:06,016 --> 00:46:07,476
Stupid squirrels.

715
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:09,770
It's on the house.

716
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:12,731
You're the only one around here
trying' to crack this case.

717
00:46:13,774 --> 00:46:15,609
- Wait. Is that the one?
- Yep.

718
00:46:15,692 --> 00:46:19,738
They broke our donut and then tore
outta here, shouting, "Enjoy your rabies."

719
00:46:20,948 --> 00:46:22,699
Wait. Gotcha!

720
00:46:28,872 --> 00:46:30,874
All right,
we know he has super-strength,

721
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:33,293
but he can't go invisible, can he?

722
00:46:34,837 --> 00:46:36,171
George Buckman?

723
00:46:36,255 --> 00:46:38,006
Miruna County Animal Control.

724
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:39,299
Go, get outta here.

725
00:46:39,383 --> 00:46:41,802
Go, go. Now, now! Go, go. Now!

726
00:46:41,885 --> 00:46:43,053
Mr. Buckman.

727
00:46:45,722 --> 00:46:47,432
We got this. We're in the big leagues now.

728
00:46:47,516 --> 00:46:49,685
This is what we've gotta do.
We gotta act natural.

729
00:46:49,768 --> 00:46:51,645
There's a bike there. Okay? Here we go.

730
00:46:51,728 --> 00:46:55,148
Closer. You're not even close to the door.
Okay. You can do this. Hands down.

731
00:46:56,358 --> 00:46:57,359
Okay.

732
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:02,865
- Mr. Buckman?
- Yes. Hey. Hi.

733
00:47:02,948 --> 00:47:05,576
- Is that your Nissan out front?
- No, I drive a Nissan.

734
00:47:06,076 --> 00:47:07,077
Seriously?

735
00:47:12,291 --> 00:47:15,168
- Flora.
- We need a place to lay low.

736
00:47:15,252 --> 00:47:17,296
The sofa will do. In, in. In.

737
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:18,380
Come on, come on.

738
00:47:18,463 --> 00:47:21,508
If you are indeed
the owner of that Nissan...

739
00:47:21,592 --> 00:47:22,593
What squirrel?

740
00:47:22,676 --> 00:47:24,178
He didn't ask about a squirrel.

741
00:47:24,261 --> 00:47:26,972
- You have a squirrel?
- No.

742
00:47:27,055 --> 00:47:30,684
No. You know what's funny? We did.
But then we cooked it.

743
00:47:30,767 --> 00:47:32,394
- Set it free.
- Set its soul free.

744
00:47:32,477 --> 00:47:34,396
- By cooking it.
- We... By cooking it.

745
00:47:34,479 --> 00:47:35,814
- Yes.
- So, it's dead?

746
00:47:35,898 --> 00:47:36,899
- No.
- Yes.

747
00:47:36,982 --> 00:47:38,692
Yes. Yes. Yes.

748
00:47:38,775 --> 00:47:40,777
- Its body is dead.
- Yeah.

749
00:47:41,612 --> 00:47:43,697
- But its heart...
- Its heart is also dead.

750
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,866
There is no part
of the squirrel alive.

751
00:47:45,949 --> 00:47:48,410
- It's super dead. Super dead.
- Yeah. It's super dead.

752
00:47:48,493 --> 00:47:50,412
So, if you like live squirrels,
get outta here.

753
00:47:50,495 --> 00:47:51,872
Get outta here, mister.

754
00:47:51,955 --> 00:47:53,707
Okay. Anyway...

755
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:55,626
Any chance that you left
the entry door open?

756
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:57,252
Yeah. Why?

757
00:48:10,474 --> 00:48:11,975
That was pretty slick.

758
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:15,229
We were, uh, pretty slick.

759
00:48:17,648 --> 00:48:18,649
Pretty slick.

760
00:48:37,334 --> 00:48:39,127
No!

761
00:48:58,939 --> 00:49:00,190
How did you do that?

762
00:49:04,611 --> 00:49:06,405
Who's got the cat-like reflexes now?

763
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:08,448
Huh? Me.

764
00:49:11,451 --> 00:49:13,245
You messed with the wrong guy, kitty.

765
00:49:20,085 --> 00:49:21,128
He got bone.

766
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:22,212
He got bone.

767
00:49:22,296 --> 00:49:23,297
Hurry!

768
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,007
Okay, we're safe now. Here we go.

769
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:26,592
- Very gently, okay?
- Flora?

770
00:49:32,931 --> 00:49:34,516
- What?
- I locked my keys in the car.

771
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,684
- Dad!
- I know. I'm sorry.

772
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:37,936
I've never been on the run
with a fugitive squirrel.

773
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:39,313
- You see 'em?
- No.

774
00:49:39,396 --> 00:49:41,273
Is that it? Right there. Is that them?

775
00:49:41,356 --> 00:49:43,400
- No, that's not them.
- That's not them.

776
00:49:43,483 --> 00:49:45,235
- There! Nailed it.
- No. I can't see them.

777
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:46,320
Okay, fine.

778
00:49:47,696 --> 00:49:48,697
This is down a little.

779
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:51,825
Ulysses.

780
00:50:09,718 --> 00:50:11,512
See, I told you it was a superpower.

781
00:50:12,888 --> 00:50:15,015
No, Ulysses, you only have to hit it once.

782
00:50:15,724 --> 00:50:17,559
Go. Oh, and now!

783
00:50:18,393 --> 00:50:19,645
Now!

784
00:50:19,728 --> 00:50:21,146
Now, now, now! Now!

785
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:23,607
Now! Now. Now. Now.

786
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:24,900
Ulysses, stop it!

787
00:50:24,983 --> 00:50:27,069
Now. Stop it. Now. Now.

788
00:50:27,152 --> 00:50:28,946
Wait, wait. Don't, don't.
Give it a second.

789
00:50:29,029 --> 00:50:30,030
Pull it now.

790
00:50:30,113 --> 00:50:32,824
Come on! Ulysses! Ulysses!

791
00:50:32,908 --> 00:50:34,993
Got it. Good job, Ulysses.

792
00:50:37,663 --> 00:50:39,122
- Holy Bagumba!
- Holy Bagumba!

793
00:50:39,206 --> 00:50:41,208
Hand over the squirrel!

794
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:43,502
No, no, no! Watch out, watch out! No!

795
00:50:44,711 --> 00:50:47,256
- Get in the car!
- Where's the car? Okay.

796
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:53,554
Everybody, hold on! I got this!

797
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:02,938
- I hadn't shut my door.
- Yep.

798
00:51:17,286 --> 00:51:19,830
Dad, he's right there.
We need to lose him!

799
00:51:19,913 --> 00:51:21,456
We will. This is the sports model.

800
00:51:22,583 --> 00:51:24,501
Something... What's happening?

801
00:51:24,585 --> 00:51:25,961
Dad, your hand's tranquilized.

802
00:51:26,044 --> 00:51:27,379
Shift it for me.

803
00:51:27,462 --> 00:51:29,423
I don't know how to drive a stick.

804
00:51:29,506 --> 00:51:30,632
- William?
- I'm blind!

805
00:51:30,716 --> 00:51:33,427
- Okay, okay, okay!
- Why didn't you just buy an automatic?

806
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:36,054
Because I wanted the sports model!
I wanted to be cool, okay?

807
00:51:36,138 --> 00:51:39,057
It's fine. We can do this. Toss it.
Toss my hand like a pancake.

808
00:51:39,141 --> 00:51:41,935
Like a pancake! Flora, like a pancake!
Through the hole.

809
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:43,812
Yeah, yeah. Yes, yes, yes.

810
00:51:43,896 --> 00:51:45,814
Here we go. Now we're rollin'.

811
00:51:50,027 --> 00:51:51,028
It's stuck.

812
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:52,404
- What?
- My hand's stuck.

813
00:51:52,487 --> 00:51:54,489
- What's going on?
- My hand is stuck.

814
00:51:55,574 --> 00:51:56,575
- Dad!
- Oh, no!

815
00:51:56,658 --> 00:51:57,951
What's happening?

816
00:51:59,411 --> 00:52:02,289
I got a cramp, too.
I got a cramp in my leg at the same time.

817
00:52:18,722 --> 00:52:19,973
You know what?

818
00:52:20,057 --> 00:52:21,391
Maybe I will drive.

819
00:52:25,312 --> 00:52:27,397
Butts, butts, butts, butts

820
00:52:27,481 --> 00:52:29,149
Butts, butts, butts, butts

821
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:31,193
And big ol' butts
And butts and butts and...

822
00:52:31,276 --> 00:52:33,820
I don't know if we were great
in the superhero world,

823
00:52:33,904 --> 00:52:37,407
since we were missing a door
and William fell out at a stoplight,

824
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:42,538
but injustice was being defeated,
and we were part of it.

825
00:52:43,497 --> 00:52:44,581
See you tomorrow.

826
00:52:44,665 --> 00:52:48,252
I will not see you,
but I will hear and smell you tomorrow.

827
00:52:48,335 --> 00:52:49,920
Thanks for keeping it weird.

828
00:52:55,759 --> 00:52:58,262
Hey, guys. Just in time for dinner.

829
00:52:58,345 --> 00:53:01,223
Okay, Phyllis. Open up. You got this.

830
00:53:06,144 --> 00:53:07,688
Go wait in the tree house.

831
00:53:11,316 --> 00:53:15,445
Dad always said the best trap
for a superhero was a feast.

832
00:53:16,238 --> 00:53:20,075
If there was soup cooking,
you were probably next.

833
00:53:21,076 --> 00:53:24,246
But Incandesto always knew
what to look for.

834
00:53:24,997 --> 00:53:29,251
Carrots.
The main ingredient in people's soup.

835
00:53:30,627 --> 00:53:31,920
Mmm-mmm.

836
00:53:48,645 --> 00:53:51,064
So, anything goin' on?

837
00:53:51,773 --> 00:53:53,817
You can tell me. I'm letting things in.

838
00:53:55,527 --> 00:53:56,737
I don't love this soup.

839
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:57,946
Well, you make it.

840
00:53:58,030 --> 00:53:59,239
Oh?

841
00:53:59,323 --> 00:54:02,367
I mean, thank you for your feedback.

842
00:54:02,451 --> 00:54:04,203
Um, so...

843
00:54:04,286 --> 00:54:06,830
- Your big interview's tomorrow, right?
- Yeah.

844
00:54:06,914 --> 00:54:08,332
- You nervous?
- No.

845
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:12,920
Marissa says it'll just be
basic questions, fluff piece.

846
00:54:14,713 --> 00:54:16,715
Yes. I'm terrified.

847
00:54:17,674 --> 00:54:19,676
Because what if I fail?

848
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,262
And this book won't sell
without good press.

849
00:54:23,263 --> 00:54:24,264
You know what?

850
00:54:25,015 --> 00:54:27,142
If you want any backup,
I'm happy to come along.

851
00:54:29,186 --> 00:54:30,187
You would do that?

852
00:54:31,396 --> 00:54:32,397
Even though we're...

853
00:54:33,315 --> 00:54:35,192
- Separated?
- Yeah.

854
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:38,612
I still want you
to do well, Phyllis.

855
00:54:38,695 --> 00:54:40,072
That'll never change.

856
00:54:42,366 --> 00:54:43,367
Thanks.

857
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:48,497
I do have one condition, though.

858
00:54:53,585 --> 00:54:55,170
You gotta let the squirrel back in.

859
00:54:55,254 --> 00:54:56,672
What's that now?

860
00:54:56,755 --> 00:54:59,424
He is a special creature
with a lot to offer the world.

861
00:54:59,508 --> 00:55:02,261
And we need to protect special creatures,
not be afraid of them.

862
00:55:03,053 --> 00:55:04,847
So, he's been livin' in the tree house.

863
00:55:05,305 --> 00:55:06,306
Oh.

864
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,101
George!

865
00:55:20,821 --> 00:55:21,822
Here he is.

866
00:55:29,788 --> 00:55:31,039
Also, I quit my job.

867
00:55:35,586 --> 00:55:37,504
Mom was inspired again.

868
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:41,216
Something was changing in all of us.

869
00:55:42,342 --> 00:55:44,553
And hopefully,
it wasn't the mashed potatoes

870
00:55:44,636 --> 00:55:46,305
we had just eaten off the floor.

871
00:56:01,111 --> 00:56:03,238
Mom said you could sleep out here tonight.

872
00:56:05,115 --> 00:56:08,202
I told her that your apartment
was under construction,

873
00:56:08,785 --> 00:56:11,914
not that Animal Control is waiting there
to shoot you with a dart.

874
00:56:13,665 --> 00:56:15,000
Thank you, sweetie.

875
00:56:18,879 --> 00:56:21,757
Why can't you just tell her
that you don't want to get divorced?

876
00:56:27,095 --> 00:56:30,516
Sometimes it's easier
to draw a superhero than to act like one.

877
00:56:38,732 --> 00:56:39,775
I love you.

878
00:56:39,858 --> 00:56:41,276
I love you 3000.

879
00:56:46,782 --> 00:56:51,370
I'm just so proud that I could bring
more beauty into the world.

880
00:56:54,289 --> 00:56:56,917
And you two have been married for...

881
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,043
Fifteen years.

882
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:00,337
- Wow!
- Yeah, 15 good ones.

883
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:03,423
Hmm. Is it weird
being married to a romance writer?

884
00:57:03,507 --> 00:57:07,469
I mean, you have to compete
with all those guys she writes about.

885
00:57:07,553 --> 00:57:09,054
How do you still sweep her away?

886
00:57:09,847 --> 00:57:12,474
I was never good at any of that. No.

887
00:57:12,558 --> 00:57:14,142
- Anyway...
- She swept me away.

888
00:57:14,643 --> 00:57:18,522
Not with a white horse or anything,
but with... With a laugh.

889
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:24,695
She has this amazing laugh
that just lights up a room.

890
00:57:28,365 --> 00:57:29,908
And this is your next book?

891
00:57:30,617 --> 00:57:32,911
Yeah. Yeah. But, hey, no peeking.

892
00:57:33,871 --> 00:57:35,706
It's actually a departure for me.

893
00:57:35,789 --> 00:57:36,999
It's basically, it's...

894
00:57:37,082 --> 00:57:38,083
Poetry.

895
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:39,167
Huh?

896
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:42,129
Oh, uh...

897
00:57:42,713 --> 00:57:44,923
Yeah. But it's garbage.

898
00:57:45,007 --> 00:57:47,718
It's just something
I do to warm up the keys.

899
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:49,386
- Mmm-hmm.
- Huh...

900
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:52,097
- But anyway, the book, it's...
- "I like it inside.

901
00:57:52,181 --> 00:57:54,725
"Blankets. Food. Flora breathing.

902
00:57:54,808 --> 00:57:58,020
"I am hungry no more. I broke the table."

903
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:03,817
Based in the roaring '20s,
when romance was...

904
00:58:06,403 --> 00:58:08,322
Have you written anything?

905
00:58:10,866 --> 00:58:12,034
I think I have enough.

906
00:58:12,826 --> 00:58:13,827
Good luck.

907
00:58:15,746 --> 00:58:17,247
Oh, no. No.

908
00:58:17,331 --> 00:58:18,957
Wait. Wait.

909
00:58:30,677 --> 00:58:32,054
I thought you did terrific.

910
00:58:33,222 --> 00:58:34,806
I should get back to work.

911
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:39,311
Okay.

912
00:58:44,858 --> 00:58:48,987
It turns out, the hardest thing
about having hope

913
00:58:49,071 --> 00:58:51,031
is watching the people who don't.

914
00:59:04,044 --> 00:59:06,046
And the only thing harder than that

915
00:59:07,172 --> 00:59:09,633
is watching the people who once did.

916
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:50,841
Hey.

917
00:59:53,051 --> 00:59:54,720
The window is busy this week.

918
00:59:54,803 --> 00:59:57,055
My apartment's being watched.
They want the squirrel.

919
00:59:57,139 --> 01:00:00,184
It's good that I skipped bowling tonight.
In, in, in.

920
01:00:01,435 --> 01:00:03,812
And even in the darkest of times,

921
01:00:05,105 --> 01:00:11,320
a true hero will risk everything
to save the world he loves.

922
01:00:58,992 --> 01:00:59,993
I'm in trouble.

923
01:01:00,619 --> 01:01:02,788
I feel like everything
is just slipping away.

924
01:01:08,377 --> 01:01:11,922
When I met the other Dr. Meescham,

925
01:01:13,507 --> 01:01:17,386
our country was at war,
each day was uncertain.

926
01:01:17,469 --> 01:01:20,305
But we always said goodbye to each other
the best way we could.

927
01:01:20,389 --> 01:01:21,390
We said,

928
01:01:22,099 --> 01:01:24,351
"I promise to always turn back to you."

929
01:01:25,102 --> 01:01:26,311
And why did you do that?

930
01:01:27,187 --> 01:01:30,357
'Cause when you turn back, you see
that the person you love is still there.

931
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:34,820
And when you don't turn back,
that is when they slip away.

932
01:01:35,612 --> 01:01:38,532
For that's the moment
that they need you the most.

933
01:01:39,157 --> 01:01:40,158
Phyllis?

934
01:01:40,242 --> 01:01:41,618
Yeah.

935
01:02:06,852 --> 01:02:08,187
Ulysses?

936
01:02:09,104 --> 01:02:10,689
Ulysses?

937
01:02:17,988 --> 01:02:19,031
"Dear Flora,

938
01:02:19,114 --> 01:02:21,533
"I am very fond of you,

939
01:02:21,617 --> 01:02:26,622
"but I hear my call to the wild,
and I must return to my natural habitat.

940
01:02:27,164 --> 01:02:29,499
"Yours, Mr. Squirrel."

941
01:02:36,757 --> 01:02:38,800
William? William Spiver?

942
01:02:40,469 --> 01:02:41,970
- Flora?
- He's gone!

943
01:02:42,054 --> 01:02:43,722
- Who is?
- Ulysses.

944
01:02:43,805 --> 01:02:45,849
I think my mom kidnapped him.

945
01:02:45,933 --> 01:02:47,059
Are you crying?

946
01:02:47,893 --> 01:02:49,019
No.

947
01:02:49,645 --> 01:02:52,189
I have her Jack and Rose.
I'm holding them hostage.

948
01:02:52,272 --> 01:02:54,441
- Makes sense.
- Are you gonna help me or not?

949
01:02:54,525 --> 01:02:55,526
Of course.

950
01:02:55,609 --> 01:02:58,654
I just have to take off my bathrobe
and run a comb through...

951
01:02:58,737 --> 01:03:00,489
Hurry! We have a hostage!

952
01:03:00,572 --> 01:03:01,657
I am!

953
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,367
Shoo! Shoo!

954
01:03:03,825 --> 01:03:04,868
Just go!

955
01:03:04,952 --> 01:03:07,204
You're making things so much harder.

956
01:03:07,996 --> 01:03:09,498
Do you understand that?

957
01:03:10,582 --> 01:03:12,918
We all needed that interview to go well.

958
01:03:13,001 --> 01:03:14,837
Nothing is going right for me.

959
01:03:15,629 --> 01:03:19,383
And it's all on me to fix it.

960
01:03:21,301 --> 01:03:22,427
Nobody cares.

961
01:03:43,073 --> 01:03:44,074
That's...

962
01:03:45,701 --> 01:03:46,743
That's for me?

963
01:04:16,982 --> 01:04:19,818
And so, your plan is to offer an exchange.

964
01:04:20,444 --> 01:04:23,113
- The Jack and Rose for the squirrel?
- Yes.

965
01:04:23,655 --> 01:04:25,824
But you have no idea where your mother is?

966
01:04:26,575 --> 01:04:28,785
I didn't say it was a perfect plan.

967
01:04:29,536 --> 01:04:30,537
I suppose.

968
01:04:32,289 --> 01:04:33,332
At least it's a plan.

969
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:37,419
I've found that when you act
without any thought or reason,

970
01:04:38,378 --> 01:04:40,297
much worse things can happen.

971
01:04:44,426 --> 01:04:45,427
Oh, boy!

972
01:04:45,511 --> 01:04:48,305
If I could see,
would I be freaking out right now?

973
01:04:48,388 --> 01:04:50,682
You'd probably say
that we need to find shelter.

974
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,726
Rather quickly.

975
01:04:57,105 --> 01:04:58,106
Come on!

976
01:05:05,239 --> 01:05:06,448
What is this place?

977
01:05:09,284 --> 01:05:10,869
Splash Rapids.

978
01:05:10,953 --> 01:05:13,830
Me and my family used to
ride our bikes here every Saturday.

979
01:05:15,374 --> 01:05:17,042
Dad would bring a second swimsuit

980
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:19,503
and let it float next to him
in the lazy river,

981
01:05:19,586 --> 01:05:21,547
just to watch the lifeguards freak out.

982
01:05:27,261 --> 01:05:28,345
And then it closed.

983
01:05:38,814 --> 01:05:40,440
I pushed a car into a lake.

984
01:05:42,234 --> 01:05:43,235
What?

985
01:05:43,861 --> 01:05:45,571
That's why my mother sent me away.

986
01:05:47,322 --> 01:05:50,868
I was taking revenge on Jacob,
her new husband.

987
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:53,078
Where's your father?

988
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:55,080
He died.

989
01:05:57,374 --> 01:05:58,375
Oh.

990
01:06:00,711 --> 01:06:02,588
Jacob wouldn't stop calling me "Billy."

991
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:04,631
Billy's not my name.

992
01:06:04,715 --> 01:06:07,092
My name is William. William Spiver.

993
01:06:08,552 --> 01:06:10,012
But he kept calling me Billy.

994
01:06:11,972 --> 01:06:13,140
I just couldn't take it.

995
01:06:17,978 --> 01:06:20,189
"William" was my father's name.

996
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:23,817
He was a man
of great humanity and intelligence.

997
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,112
He played the piano,

998
01:06:27,196 --> 01:06:30,616
and he knew about
astronomy and the universe.

999
01:06:33,076 --> 01:06:35,037
Jacob doesn't know there even are stars.

1000
01:06:36,121 --> 01:06:37,706
He just knows about his car.

1001
01:06:57,935 --> 01:06:58,936
Hello?

1002
01:07:07,402 --> 01:07:09,863
The journalist
was wrong about his poetry.

1003
01:07:13,867 --> 01:07:15,285
A squirrel sees it.

1004
01:07:16,495 --> 01:07:18,664
He sees all the beauty in the world.

1005
01:07:19,414 --> 01:07:20,874
He sees Flora.

1006
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:23,794
I can't believe
I'm losing my family

1007
01:07:23,877 --> 01:07:26,004
because I can't view the world
like a squirrel.

1008
01:07:28,131 --> 01:07:30,676
It's definitely not how I thought
the week was gonna turn out.

1009
01:07:30,759 --> 01:07:33,303
Do you know how much
it costs to get a new car door?

1010
01:07:33,387 --> 01:07:34,638
More than the actual car.

1011
01:07:37,516 --> 01:07:38,767
You haven't lost anybody.

1012
01:07:40,811 --> 01:07:42,646
I just forgot to turn back.

1013
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:53,991
Where's Flora?

1014
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:57,452
What are you thinking about?

1015
01:07:57,536 --> 01:08:00,956
The Illuminated Adventures
Of The Amazing Incandesto.

1016
01:08:02,249 --> 01:08:05,961
There's this picture of Alfred T. Slipper
looking out at the world,

1017
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:10,048
and Dolores is on his shoulder,
and he turns to her and says,

1018
01:08:11,258 --> 01:08:13,510
"I'm alone in the world, Dolores.

1019
01:08:14,553 --> 01:08:16,805
"And I'm homesick for my own kind."

1020
01:08:19,474 --> 01:08:20,517
I'm homesick.

1021
01:08:22,144 --> 01:08:23,520
I miss my family.

1022
01:08:24,938 --> 01:08:26,273
I miss what we used to be.

1023
01:08:26,982 --> 01:08:28,400
But you're not alone.

1024
01:08:31,445 --> 01:08:33,238
Flora!

1025
01:08:33,322 --> 01:08:35,073
Don't take another step!

1026
01:08:35,157 --> 01:08:38,285
Show me Ulysses,
or Jack and Rose are dead.

1027
01:08:38,785 --> 01:08:40,913
The figurine,
I know the ones in the movie are dead.

1028
01:08:40,996 --> 01:08:44,583
It's okay. He's right here.

1029
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:46,376
Good.

1030
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:49,463
Now, slowly hand him to William,
and I will slowly...

1031
01:08:51,298 --> 01:08:52,466
Oh, dang it.

1032
01:08:55,344 --> 01:08:57,554
Jack and Rose have the worst luck.

1033
01:08:59,431 --> 01:09:00,974
That was just a decoy?

1034
01:09:01,058 --> 01:09:03,644
No, it wasn't.

1035
01:09:15,572 --> 01:09:17,616
I was gonna take him away, Flora.

1036
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:19,701
And then...

1037
01:09:21,578 --> 01:09:22,579
I saw this.

1038
01:09:25,582 --> 01:09:27,793
Okay. You don't have to do that anymore.
It's okay.

1039
01:09:27,876 --> 01:09:29,253
"Words for Flora.

1040
01:09:30,212 --> 01:09:34,424
"Nothing would be easier without you
because you are everything.

1041
01:09:35,175 --> 01:09:36,176
"All of it.

1042
01:09:36,802 --> 01:09:40,722
"Cheese puffs, corks, giant donuts...

1043
01:09:41,431 --> 01:09:44,351
"You are the ever-expanding
universe to me."

1044
01:09:47,563 --> 01:09:49,064
You are everything.

1045
01:09:51,191 --> 01:09:55,445
My life is screwed up, but you aren't.

1046
01:09:57,614 --> 01:09:59,867
You're what I did right.

1047
01:10:02,202 --> 01:10:04,872
How could I ever forget
that there's magic in the world

1048
01:10:04,955 --> 01:10:08,041
when you're standing right in front of me?

1049
01:10:21,638 --> 01:10:22,639
Yeah!

1050
01:10:22,723 --> 01:10:24,600
- Ulysses!
- Nobody move!

1051
01:10:24,683 --> 01:10:25,934
- Don't hurt him!
- Stand down!

1052
01:10:26,018 --> 01:10:27,352
- George!
- Get him, get him!

1053
01:10:27,436 --> 01:10:28,770
George!

1054
01:10:34,234 --> 01:10:35,694
Dad!

1055
01:10:37,821 --> 01:10:38,822
Got him!

1056
01:10:38,906 --> 01:10:41,074
Stop! He doesn't have rabies!

1057
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:46,205
That's not somethin' we can risk.

1058
01:10:47,206 --> 01:10:50,125
And the only way
to do that is to test his brain tissue.

1059
01:10:52,127 --> 01:10:55,130
Look, I'm sorry.
He'll be euthanized this afternoon.

1060
01:10:55,214 --> 01:10:56,632
No!

1061
01:10:58,467 --> 01:11:00,969
Flare up like a flame, Ulysses!

1062
01:11:01,053 --> 01:11:02,804
Flare up like a flame!

1063
01:11:06,433 --> 01:11:08,977
Oh, baby. It's okay. It's okay.

1064
01:11:15,567 --> 01:11:16,610
Okay. Flora,

1065
01:11:17,236 --> 01:11:19,238
do you remember
how Incandesto overcame the odds

1066
01:11:19,321 --> 01:11:21,365
and defeated the darkness
of a thousand hands?

1067
01:11:23,116 --> 01:11:24,493
He teamed up with Dolores.

1068
01:11:24,576 --> 01:11:25,953
Yes. And?

1069
01:11:28,664 --> 01:11:30,582
And the thorny blowfish.

1070
01:11:32,084 --> 01:11:33,085
Really?

1071
01:11:35,587 --> 01:11:36,588
Okay.

1072
01:11:37,631 --> 01:11:40,467
For you,
I'll be the thorny blowfish any day.

1073
01:11:40,968 --> 01:11:43,345
Good. 'Cause I feel like
you're the only one of us

1074
01:11:43,428 --> 01:11:45,389
who will actually
punch somebody in the face.

1075
01:11:45,472 --> 01:11:47,850
- Oh, you got that right.
- Hey!

1076
01:11:47,933 --> 01:11:49,518
Is there a fourth weird character?

1077
01:11:49,601 --> 01:11:51,311
There was a talking chair.

1078
01:11:52,729 --> 01:11:53,730
I'll take it.

1079
01:11:54,857 --> 01:11:55,858
Okay.

1080
01:11:55,941 --> 01:11:57,401
All right. All right.

1081
01:11:59,027 --> 01:12:00,070
Let's finish this.

1082
01:12:04,074 --> 01:12:08,203
You don't come into our water park
unless you're ready to make some waves.

1083
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:24,303
Do you want me to slow down?

1084
01:12:24,386 --> 01:12:25,387
Nope.

1085
01:12:26,972 --> 01:12:28,140
I like the sport model.

1086
01:12:36,815 --> 01:12:37,816
We've got this.

1087
01:12:42,821 --> 01:12:44,573
Wait,
won't they know we're coming?

1088
01:12:44,656 --> 01:12:47,117
Yeah, but they won't know
who's not coming.

1089
01:12:47,201 --> 01:12:48,202
What?

1090
01:12:51,079 --> 01:12:52,080
Hello!

1091
01:12:52,748 --> 01:12:54,416
Just lookin' to adopt a pet.

1092
01:13:04,885 --> 01:13:07,137
What a wonderful adventure.

1093
01:13:07,763 --> 01:13:11,058
I haven't driven the other Dr. Meescham's
car since my license was revoked.

1094
01:13:13,936 --> 01:13:14,937
Yeah.

1095
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:17,356
We should get inside
before somebody sees us.

1096
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:18,690
Okay. I'm comin'.

1097
01:13:21,527 --> 01:13:22,819
You remembered to turn back.

1098
01:13:23,403 --> 01:13:24,404
I did.

1099
01:13:32,871 --> 01:13:34,456
...over. Stand by.

1100
01:13:35,415 --> 01:13:36,416
Come on, boy.

1101
01:13:39,002 --> 01:13:40,087
He'll be in that lab.

1102
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,011
It's locked, it's locked.

1103
01:13:50,097 --> 01:13:53,308
I could squeeze through that vent
and open the door from the inside.

1104
01:13:53,392 --> 01:13:54,560
No. I'll do it.

1105
01:13:55,269 --> 01:13:57,437
I seem to have a knack
for absorbing short falls.

1106
01:14:00,732 --> 01:14:01,775
You okay?

1107
01:14:01,859 --> 01:14:02,860
Nothing broken!

1108
01:14:12,202 --> 01:14:13,453
I can't see anything.

1109
01:14:14,204 --> 01:14:16,456
It's okay, I'll use echolocation.

1110
01:14:20,335 --> 01:14:21,336
All clear.

1111
01:14:27,259 --> 01:14:29,261
I thought you said it was all clear.

1112
01:14:29,344 --> 01:14:32,598
I meant for me.
Your position would have a different echo.

1113
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:35,225
Now everything has an echo.

1114
01:14:42,232 --> 01:14:44,860
You know what? The lab must be
on the other side of those doors.

1115
01:14:44,943 --> 01:14:45,944
Okay.

1116
01:14:50,449 --> 01:14:52,659
Let's go. We've got this.

1117
01:14:53,577 --> 01:14:55,078
You don't have to do this.

1118
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:00,792
When I asked my father
about the expanding universe,

1119
01:15:02,711 --> 01:15:06,215
he said, "Maybe it's just putting things
where they're supposed to be."

1120
01:15:08,050 --> 01:15:10,135
I think this is where I'm supposed to be.

1121
01:15:13,096 --> 01:15:14,264
I think so, too.

1122
01:15:27,444 --> 01:15:28,445
William?

1123
01:15:33,158 --> 01:15:34,159
Skunk!

1124
01:15:34,243 --> 01:15:35,953
I saw it!

1125
01:15:36,036 --> 01:15:37,412
- What's going on?
- I can see!

1126
01:15:37,496 --> 01:15:39,957
- There's still a skunk right there!
- That was my fault!

1127
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:42,084
- I saw a skunk!
- Wait a second, you can see?

1128
01:15:42,167 --> 01:15:44,169
Yeah! I guess I'm less hysterical.

1129
01:15:44,253 --> 01:15:46,213
- Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go!
- Go!

1130
01:15:55,389 --> 01:15:58,100
Excuse me, this is a hazardous area.
You can't be in here.

1131
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:01,061
Okay, I got this one. I got this.

1132
01:16:01,144 --> 01:16:02,271
Oh, boy.

1133
01:16:03,063 --> 01:16:04,439
Hey. How are ya?

1134
01:16:04,523 --> 01:16:07,109
We're actually here to adopt a puppy.

1135
01:16:08,193 --> 01:16:09,194
Nice.

1136
01:16:09,862 --> 01:16:12,573
Oh, um, well, actually,
you need to go to the lobby.

1137
01:16:12,656 --> 01:16:13,657
This way?

1138
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:15,784
Hey! They're after the rabid squirrel!

1139
01:16:15,868 --> 01:16:18,161
- Go, go, go!
- Come on! This ain't a drill.

1140
01:16:18,245 --> 01:16:19,830
- Hey!
- Call security!

1141
01:16:19,913 --> 01:16:20,914
It's this way!

1142
01:16:20,998 --> 01:16:22,541
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em!

1143
01:16:23,166 --> 01:16:24,918
Somebody do something!

1144
01:16:25,002 --> 01:16:26,503
Find Ulysses and get outta here!

1145
01:16:27,838 --> 01:16:28,839
This way!

1146
01:16:30,257 --> 01:16:32,384
Not in my house!
Tasers up! Let's go, let's go!

1147
01:16:32,885 --> 01:16:35,637
- Does anyone see him?
- Not yet, keep looking!

1148
01:16:35,721 --> 01:16:37,014
Come on, chop-chop!

1149
01:16:37,097 --> 01:16:38,098
Look!

1150
01:16:44,730 --> 01:16:45,731
Wait, wait, no, no, no!

1151
01:16:47,608 --> 01:16:49,026
Oh, no. Wait!

1152
01:16:49,109 --> 01:16:50,819
All right, just grab an animal.

1153
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:53,071
Contain 'em!

1154
01:16:55,657 --> 01:16:56,742
Poppins...

1155
01:16:56,825 --> 01:16:58,285
Get... Find Poppins! Come on!

1156
01:16:58,368 --> 01:16:59,369
Squirrels!

1157
01:16:59,453 --> 01:17:01,163
Open the cages! Come on!

1158
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:02,831
Ulysses!

1159
01:17:04,791 --> 01:17:06,460
- I don't see him!
- Ulysses!

1160
01:17:06,543 --> 01:17:07,544
Keep looking!

1161
01:17:09,546 --> 01:17:11,965
Ulysses!

1162
01:17:12,049 --> 01:17:13,967
- I found him!
- Hey, buddy!

1163
01:17:14,051 --> 01:17:16,678
Don't worry, Ulysses.
We're going to save you.

1164
01:17:16,762 --> 01:17:18,347
Aw, he's cuter than I thought.

1165
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:19,431
I need a knife!

1166
01:17:19,515 --> 01:17:20,891
I have nail clippers.

1167
01:17:20,974 --> 01:17:21,975
- What?
- Stop...

1168
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:24,561
Right there.

1169
01:17:26,104 --> 01:17:27,189
Do you like M&M'S?

1170
01:17:27,272 --> 01:17:28,815
No, I care about my teeth. Why?

1171
01:17:29,399 --> 01:17:30,400
Squirrels do.

1172
01:17:36,073 --> 01:17:37,449
No, no, no!

1173
01:17:39,826 --> 01:17:40,827
Go wait in the lobby.

1174
01:17:40,911 --> 01:17:42,246
- Tiny claws.
- Big claws.

1175
01:17:42,329 --> 01:17:43,330
Let's go, come on!

1176
01:17:44,414 --> 01:17:46,124
You're not goin' anywhere!

1177
01:17:46,208 --> 01:17:47,251
What...

1178
01:17:47,334 --> 01:17:49,378
Do not mess with the thorny blowfish!

1179
01:17:51,171 --> 01:17:52,172
My teeth...

1180
01:17:52,881 --> 01:17:54,049
He doesn't belong here.

1181
01:17:57,636 --> 01:17:58,637
Step away from the cage.

1182
01:17:58,720 --> 01:17:59,805
You really wanna do this?

1183
01:18:00,389 --> 01:18:02,933
Because I have spent
the better part of my life

1184
01:18:03,016 --> 01:18:06,019
dreaming of ways
to take down villains like you.

1185
01:18:06,103 --> 01:18:07,104
This is my jam.

1186
01:18:08,772 --> 01:18:09,773
Cool speech.

1187
01:18:10,274 --> 01:18:11,400
Get away from the squirrel.

1188
01:18:11,483 --> 01:18:12,693
What squirrel?

1189
01:18:12,776 --> 01:18:13,777
The...

1190
01:18:14,987 --> 01:18:16,363
No, no, no, no, no!

1191
01:18:19,157 --> 01:18:21,368
Bull's-eye! No, no!

1192
01:18:23,203 --> 01:18:24,872
Hey, you!

1193
01:18:25,914 --> 01:18:26,915
Forgive me.

1194
01:18:30,085 --> 01:18:31,128
Ulysses!

1195
01:18:36,633 --> 01:18:39,303
Okay. Come on, come on, come on.
We gotta go. Go.

1196
01:18:44,892 --> 01:18:47,019
No! Get off!

1197
01:18:47,769 --> 01:18:48,812
Ow!

1198
01:18:53,192 --> 01:18:54,193
That's not good.

1199
01:18:57,779 --> 01:18:59,990
He's gonna make it.

1200
01:19:00,073 --> 01:19:01,783
That guy had him cornered.

1201
01:19:01,867 --> 01:19:03,243
He's going to make it.

1202
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:10,918
Son of a...

1203
01:19:16,215 --> 01:19:17,216
Don't move!

1204
01:19:17,925 --> 01:19:18,926
Dad!

1205
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:23,931
- You're not leaving with the squirrel!
- George!

1206
01:19:24,014 --> 01:19:25,098
Hey!

1207
01:19:25,182 --> 01:19:26,558
Oh, no!

1208
01:19:26,642 --> 01:19:27,684
Oh, no!

1209
01:19:27,768 --> 01:19:29,436
Ulysses!

1210
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,729
Okay, I can't feel my legs.

1211
01:19:30,812 --> 01:19:32,272
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1212
01:19:32,356 --> 01:19:34,733
Stand down. I can't look!

1213
01:19:35,442 --> 01:19:36,735
George!

1214
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:43,242
- George!
- Dad!

1215
01:19:52,876 --> 01:19:55,003
I'm flying!

1216
01:19:55,087 --> 01:19:58,423
Every superhero
comes to us with a purpose.

1217
01:20:01,718 --> 01:20:03,804
We don't always see it at first.

1218
01:20:04,888 --> 01:20:07,474
Because we don't
always know where to look.

1219
01:20:07,558 --> 01:20:09,059
This is amazing!

1220
01:20:09,142 --> 01:20:11,186
But Ulysses showed us...

1221
01:20:15,607 --> 01:20:18,610
...the world is filled
with wonder and magic.

1222
01:20:23,073 --> 01:20:24,116
Huh?

1223
01:20:25,742 --> 01:20:27,077
Ulysses!

1224
01:20:27,703 --> 01:20:31,206
And we found it in the people we love.

1225
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:38,422
I can't even feel my leg.

1226
01:20:40,299 --> 01:20:41,300
Here.

1227
01:20:46,263 --> 01:20:47,264
You're not coming?

1228
01:20:47,347 --> 01:20:49,057
This is not my adventure, dear.

1229
01:21:02,487 --> 01:21:05,616
Did we just break a magical squirrel
out of animal jail?

1230
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:06,825
We did.

1231
01:21:06,909 --> 01:21:08,035
Thanks, Ulysses.

1232
01:21:08,702 --> 01:21:10,329
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah.

1233
01:21:13,707 --> 01:21:14,958
Oh...

1234
01:21:15,042 --> 01:21:16,043
Oh, gee...

1235
01:21:18,962 --> 01:21:21,590
The world is full of injustice.

1236
01:21:23,884 --> 01:21:26,970
And there are always
other people who need saving.

1237
01:21:30,349 --> 01:21:34,061
Which meant that
the most heroic thing we could do

1238
01:21:37,523 --> 01:21:39,149
was to say goodbye.

1239
01:21:48,742 --> 01:21:49,743
Don't give up.

1240
01:21:53,163 --> 01:21:54,164
On my comics?

1241
01:21:55,499 --> 01:21:56,500
On me.

1242
01:21:57,876 --> 01:21:58,877
Never.

1243
01:22:13,892 --> 01:22:15,477
Thank you, Ulysses.

1244
01:22:21,483 --> 01:22:22,484
Go on, now.

1245
01:22:23,986 --> 01:22:25,362
Flare up like a flame.

1246
01:22:39,084 --> 01:22:40,544
Hey! Buckmans!

1247
01:22:41,795 --> 01:22:43,130
You're not gettin' rid o' me.

1248
01:22:45,382 --> 01:22:46,383
Turn him over.

1249
01:22:47,217 --> 01:22:48,760
He's all yours.

1250
01:22:52,264 --> 01:22:53,390
Oh...

1251
01:22:53,473 --> 01:22:54,683
So much rabies.

1252
01:22:58,562 --> 01:23:00,772
The world was as it should be.

1253
01:23:02,649 --> 01:23:05,861
Ulysses could stay hidden from
those who would do him harm.

1254
01:23:07,988 --> 01:23:10,949
And be ready to defend those in need.

1255
01:23:21,585 --> 01:23:22,794
We had love,

1256
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:25,297
and we had comic books.

1257
01:23:26,256 --> 01:23:28,675
Not just the ones we got to read,

1258
01:23:29,676 --> 01:23:31,261
but the ones we got to live.

1259
01:23:35,516 --> 01:23:39,394
People will say it didn't happen,
that squirrels can't write poetry,

1260
01:23:40,145 --> 01:23:42,773
and that the world
isn't full of superheroes.

1261
01:23:45,275 --> 01:23:47,277
But like any natural-born cynic...

1262
01:23:48,695 --> 01:23:52,032
...I say, "Do not hope. Observe."

1263
01:23:54,201 --> 01:23:55,369
Because when you do,

1264
01:23:56,745 --> 01:24:00,582
you'll see how much wonder
the world actually has,

1265
01:24:09,633 --> 01:24:12,302
and you won't be a cynic anymore.

1266
01:24:42,833 --> 01:24:44,585
Even after he bit me in the face,

1267
01:24:46,169 --> 01:24:50,007
that rattlesnake knew,
I wasn't leavin' the hole until he did.

1268
01:24:50,799 --> 01:24:51,967
Wow!

1269
01:24:52,050 --> 01:24:53,969
You're not afraid of anything.

1270
01:24:57,306 --> 01:24:59,349
I am afraid of some things.

1271
01:25:00,934 --> 01:25:01,935
Oh.

1272
01:25:09,318 --> 01:25:11,570
Is that a cat?

1273
01:25:11,653 --> 01:25:13,739
Yeah. That's Mr. Klaus.

1274
01:25:13,822 --> 01:25:15,449
He's my best friend.

1275
01:25:18,994 --> 01:25:20,329
Hello, Mr. Klaus.
