- Yeah, sure.
- [man] Then what?

7
00:02:55,668 --> 00:02:57,502
We can get tickets
for something to see?

8
00:02:58,603 --> 00:03:00,539
- We can see the symphony.
- Huh?

9
00:03:00,907 --> 00:03:02,074
It'll finish really late.

10
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:04,076
We can catch the last train,
huh?

Excuse me.
Could you give me a light?

16
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,614
Yeah, sure.

17
00:04:16,782 --> 00:04:18,184
You're Americans, yes?

18
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:20,119
Yes, sir.
We're on a summer trip.

19
00:04:22,688 --> 00:04:25,858
Please,
take this to your embassy.

20
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,761
It is vital.
I have no other way.

21
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:30,062
Come on. Let's get out of here.

22
00:04:30,096 --> 00:04:32,765
Do not go back to your hotel,
straight to the embassy.

23
00:04:33,032 --> 00:04:35,134
Give this only
to Deputy Chief of Mission.

24
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:36,936
Understand?

[indistinct chatter]

27
00:05:28,154 --> 00:05:29,587
- [Emily] Thank you.
- [James] Mm.

28
00:05:30,256 --> 00:05:32,692
- Emily. Lovely as ever.
- Ah!

29
00:05:32,892 --> 00:05:34,526
You do brighten up
the old place.

30
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:35,493
Oh, thank you.

31
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:36,796
- Emily?
- Sir.

32
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:37,964
- Please sit down.
- Ah.

33
00:05:39,597 --> 00:05:41,968
I've brought you boys a present.

34
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,712
Ah, thank you.

35
00:05:54,847 --> 00:05:56,115
Rachel, step out.

36
00:05:59,584 --> 00:06:00,720
[door opens]

37
00:06:01,954 --> 00:06:04,790
- [door closes]
- I fear a nuclear war is coming

38
00:06:05,124 --> 00:06:06,859
and I want to help you
prevent it.

39
00:06:08,027 --> 00:06:09,261
It's got my attention.

40
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:11,964
[Emily] He's smart.

41
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:14,000
Gave us a photo
only we'd have copies of

42
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,802
from a few years ago
in our embassy in Turkey.

43
00:06:17,303 --> 00:06:22,742
Say hello to Colonel Oleg
Vladimirovich Penkovsky.

44
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,744
Code name "Ironbark".

45
00:06:24,777 --> 00:06:26,645
Artillery officer
during the war,

46
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:28,546
decorated 13 times.

47
00:06:28,814 --> 00:06:29,547
Now he's back in Moscow

48
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:31,917
running the State Committee
for Scientific Research.

49
00:06:32,251 --> 00:06:33,618
But that's just a cover.

50
00:06:35,154 --> 00:06:36,655
He's GRU.

51
00:06:41,894 --> 00:06:43,095
Why they toss him?

52
00:06:43,796 --> 00:06:45,898
Hand like this
I keep place to my chest.

53
00:06:45,931 --> 00:06:47,867
[James] Because they have
no way to make contact.

54
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:50,803
The CIA is weak in Moscow
after that...

55
00:06:51,237 --> 00:06:54,040
disaster with Popov. Am I right?

56
00:06:54,974 --> 00:06:58,244
We're thin on the ground.
We need your help.

57
00:07:00,646 --> 00:07:01,347
Let's get him out.

58
00:07:01,814 --> 00:07:03,849
We've got a number of
good officers in our embassy.

59
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:05,985
I'll have one make contact
with Penkovsky,

60
00:07:06,018 --> 00:07:08,120
- get this sorted out.
- [Emily] I did have a thought.

61
00:07:09,321 --> 00:07:12,758
This is a GRU Colonel.
He's so visible.

62
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:14,026
I'm worried
we could blow Penkovsky

63
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,294
just by making an approach.

64
00:07:15,795 --> 00:07:19,198
That's always a risk. What would
the CIA have us do instead?

65
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,200
I don't know.

66
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,071
Maybe use someone
outside the embassy

67
00:07:25,538 --> 00:07:28,007
who the KGB won't suspect?

68
00:07:28,474 --> 00:07:31,877
Say a businessman who travels
to that part of the world.

69
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:35,948
Do we know of someone
who could fit the bill?

70
00:07:36,482 --> 00:07:37,383
[Greville] I have to warn you,

71
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,853
I have a pretty good feeling
about this.

72
00:07:43,155 --> 00:07:44,190
Oh, hell.

73
00:07:44,223 --> 00:07:45,958
- [man 1 laughs]
- [man 2 laughs]

74
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:47,993
[man 1] And Greville,
that is the saddest thing

75
00:07:48,194 --> 00:07:49,695
I've ever seen.

76
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:51,864
[Greville grunts]
Well, serves me right,

77
00:07:51,897 --> 00:07:53,966
- I should keep my mouth shut.
- [man 1 laughs]

78
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:56,235
[man 2]
Now we have to make it up.

79
00:07:57,736 --> 00:07:59,705
We probably have some brochures.

80
00:07:59,905 --> 00:08:00,840
[man 1] Of what?

81
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,374
[Greville]
A drink first, I think.

82
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:07,213
You know my reputation.

83
00:08:07,513 --> 00:08:09,348
Parts I want you to know anyway.
[chuckles]

84
00:08:09,815 --> 00:08:12,084
I represent
the top manufacturers

85
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:14,186
who sell the best products
on the market.

86
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,389
So in combination with you
gentlemen knowing your business,

87
00:08:17,423 --> 00:08:18,791
I think it'd be much better if

88
00:08:18,824 --> 00:08:20,159
instead of my usual song
and dance.

89
00:08:20,593 --> 00:08:23,162
I just listen. You tell me what
your problems are,

90
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:26,298
and if I think I have a client
that may have a solution,

91
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:30,136
let's talk it through.
If not, let's keep drinking.

92
00:08:31,103 --> 00:08:32,905
So tell me, what do you need?

93
00:08:33,772 --> 00:08:35,741
- [man] Thanks, Greville.
- [Greville] Bye.

94
00:08:45,985 --> 00:08:47,286
[thunder rumbling]

95
00:09:06,906 --> 00:09:08,941
It still doesn't add up.

96
00:09:08,974 --> 00:09:11,243
Well, did you miss something
maybe?

97
00:09:11,277 --> 00:09:12,278
[door bangs]

98
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,980
- Like carrying the four?
- Oh, yes.

99
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:16,782
- Oh, yes.
- [Greville] How are you?

100
00:09:17,016 --> 00:09:19,852
Oh, very well. Except our son
keeps confusing me

101
00:09:19,885 --> 00:09:22,087
helping with his homework
with me doing it for him.

102
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:22,821
[Greville] Oh.

103
00:09:23,155 --> 00:09:25,090
- How was your day?
- [Greville] Oh, the usual.

104
00:09:25,124 --> 00:09:27,459
Some empty flatteries
and blatant sucking up.

105
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,128
No, really,
you should have seen me.

106
00:09:29,328 --> 00:09:32,031
I sold a dozen lace by throwing
the easiest putt

107
00:09:32,064 --> 00:09:33,332
in the history of putting.

108
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,167
- I feel filthy.
- No. No.

109
00:09:35,201 --> 00:09:36,702
You have to play golf badly.

110
00:09:37,236 --> 00:09:39,104
- But aren't you used to that?
- [Greville] Uh-huh!

111
00:09:39,471 --> 00:09:41,440
Well, just think
another 23 years of this

112
00:09:41,473 --> 00:09:42,942
and then we're off
to the good life.

113
00:09:43,475 --> 00:09:45,211
Or I could retire early.

114
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:47,880
Andrew, you don't want
to go to university, do you?

115
00:09:47,913 --> 00:09:49,315
- [telephone ringing]
- [Andrew] Not really.

116
00:09:49,348 --> 00:09:50,849
- [Greville] Perfect.
- Well, I'm not feeding

117
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:52,051
either of you.

118
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:53,485
Then what you're smiling at?

119
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,454
Be at least 50 years
until you can retire.

120
00:09:55,487 --> 00:09:57,990
- [James] <i>Greville Wynne, please?</i>
- Yeah. Let me see if he's home.

121
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:02,194
- Sounds like work.
- No. Tell them I'm in my chair.

122
00:10:02,828 --> 00:10:04,830
Yes. He's just walked in.

123
00:10:11,103 --> 00:10:14,440
- Greville Wynne.
- <i>Greville, this is James Dobie</i>

124
00:10:14,473 --> 00:10:16,809
<i>from the Board of Trade.
We met last year.</i>

125
00:10:16,842 --> 00:10:18,777
Yes. Yes. At the reception
of Whitehall.

126
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:20,846
James.
How good to hear from you.

127
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,948
- James, hello.
- [James] Greville.

128
00:10:24,116 --> 00:10:24,850
I hope you don't mind.

129
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:27,886
My friend Helen is a consultant
in from the States.

130
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,255
I thought, "Why not?"

131
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:31,457
Greville Wynne. A real pleasure.

132
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,259
Helen Talbot, likewise.

133
00:10:35,828 --> 00:10:38,030
James tells me you've been
working in Eastern Europe.

134
00:10:38,063 --> 00:10:40,833
Hmm. More and more,
tremendous opportunities.

135
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,102
Plenty of demand,
no local supplies.

136
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:46,238
Czechoslovakia, Hungary.

137
00:10:46,805 --> 00:10:49,108
- Ghastly food. [chuckles]
- [chuckles]

138
00:10:49,676 --> 00:10:51,277
What about the Soviet Union?

139
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,945
[Greville]
Oh, not just yet. Someday.

140
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,281
I'd like to see temperatures
cool off a bit first.

141
00:10:55,314 --> 00:10:57,049
Actually now might be
the perfect time.

142
00:10:57,249 --> 00:10:59,018
Oh, really? Why?
What did you hear?

143
00:10:59,385 --> 00:11:01,053
Well,
Helen and I have associates

144
00:11:01,086 --> 00:11:03,289
who would be interested
to see what might come of it.

145
00:11:05,524 --> 00:11:07,493
It would be a real service
to Great Britain.

146
00:11:08,527 --> 00:11:09,862
And the world.

147
00:11:10,262 --> 00:11:13,299
[indistinct chatter]

148
00:11:26,512 --> 00:11:28,080
Forgive me. I'm just a bit...

149
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,185
Sorry. James,
I know you said you had

150
00:11:33,218 --> 00:11:35,054
an office in Board of Trade.

151
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:37,189
But...

152
00:11:38,023 --> 00:11:39,958
Is it possible
that you actually work...

153
00:11:40,592 --> 00:11:43,329
at a different branch
of Her Majesty's government?

154
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:48,534
Oh, my.

155
00:11:51,403 --> 00:11:52,838
This is unexpected.

156
00:11:54,206 --> 00:11:56,975
[stammers]
Sorry, I... I don't understand.

157
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:59,945
Why, I'm... I'm...
I'm just a salesman.

158
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:02,581
Exactly. An ordinary salesman

159
00:12:02,614 --> 00:12:04,450
with no connection
to the government.

160
00:12:04,483 --> 00:12:06,585
Look, this is all fascinating.
I mean, I really can't believe

161
00:12:06,618 --> 00:12:10,122
I'm actually having lunch
with spies. [chuckles]

162
00:12:11,156 --> 00:12:12,224
But... [chuckles]

163
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:16,161
[clears throat]
...I couldn't possibly...

164
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:24,103
- What would you want me to do?
- Nothing dodgy, nothing illegal,

165
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,871
just what you would
naturally do.

166
00:12:26,105 --> 00:12:27,373
[Greville]
I'm sorry. I don't follow.

167
00:12:27,841 --> 00:12:29,174
Someone in your field

168
00:12:29,508 --> 00:12:31,644
hoping to do business
in the Soviet Union,

169
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:33,379
how would you get started?

170
00:12:35,114 --> 00:12:36,148
Well, I suppose I'd set up

171
00:12:36,181 --> 00:12:37,950
a meeting
with the State Committee

172
00:12:37,983 --> 00:12:40,018
for Scientific Research
in Moscow.

173
00:12:40,653 --> 00:12:42,054
That sounds fine.

174
00:12:42,521 --> 00:12:46,325
So you want me to go to Moscow

let me put this delicately,

184
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:08,347

and isn't exactly in top shape.

you were a private,

My point is, if this mission
was the least bit dangerous,

189

you really are the last man
we'd send.

But that won't worry
the Politburo.

349
00:28:07,781 --> 00:28:10,282
Do you think in the end
that'll keep Khrushchev

350
00:28:10,316 --> 00:28:11,850
from going too far?

351
00:28:14,553 --> 00:28:16,322
You have to be up
in a few hours.

352
00:28:16,355 --> 00:28:18,590
- I'm fine.
- No, he's right.

353
00:28:18,792 --> 00:28:20,459
We can finish this up
tomorrow night.

354
00:28:22,629 --> 00:28:24,129
And one last thing...

355
00:28:25,431 --> 00:28:26,999
we need to talk about Greville.

356
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:30,102
Don't worry. You won't have
to deal with him anymore.

357
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:37,343
- No.
- It was Penkovsky's idea.

358
00:28:37,376 --> 00:28:38,911
You're perfect,
you're a civilian,

359
00:28:38,944 --> 00:28:39,813
so the KGB
won't be watching you.

360
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:42,948
You'll be in and out of Moscow
anyway to setup contracts.

361
00:28:43,449 --> 00:28:45,117
You still won't know
any specifics,

362
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,185
you'll just be a courier.

363
00:28:46,218 --> 00:28:48,220
Just a courier
for Russian sea...

364
00:28:51,323 --> 00:28:53,359
My God, I can't believe
you're bloody serious.

365
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:55,427
We've gone over it
with Penkovsky.

366
00:28:55,461 --> 00:28:57,496
We believe the risk
to you is minimal.

367
00:28:57,731 --> 00:28:59,064
And we'll pay you.

368
00:28:59,098 --> 00:29:01,266
I make my own money,
thank you very much.

369
00:29:01,634 --> 00:29:04,036
I have a wife and a child.

370
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:06,238
Either of you have a family?

371
00:29:08,006 --> 00:29:08,974
Oh, no.

372
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:10,643
Don't suppose you could tell me
about that,

373
00:29:10,677 --> 00:29:14,279
not a lot you can tell me about,
is there? Helen, James.

374
00:29:14,313 --> 00:29:16,949
I can tell you we'd both
put ourselves in harm's way

375
00:29:16,982 --> 00:29:20,219
when necessary and this
is terribly necessary, Greville.

376
00:29:20,252 --> 00:29:22,054
Then might I suggest you
find someone

377
00:29:22,087 --> 00:29:23,489
who's suited for it.

378
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:26,392
Sorry. I really have done
all I can for you.

379
00:29:26,425 --> 00:29:27,493
[Helen] Greville, listen.

380
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,263
The four-minute warning,
it won't do you any good.

381
00:29:31,296 --> 00:29:33,098
- What?
- [Helen] The four-minute warning

382
00:29:33,132 --> 00:29:35,668
before a Soviet nuclear missile
hits the UK.

383
00:29:35,702 --> 00:29:38,270
No, I know what that...
what are you talking about?

384
00:29:38,303 --> 00:29:40,105
That... that's what this has
all been about?

385
00:29:40,139 --> 00:29:42,141
Nuclear war? Come on.

386
00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:47,579
See, here's the problem for you.

387
00:29:49,148 --> 00:29:51,450
Your house is a 12-minute drive
from your office,

388
00:29:51,483 --> 00:29:53,552
ten minutes if you really push,
right?

389
00:29:53,986 --> 00:29:55,521
And you're usually out
on a sales call anyway,

390
00:29:55,554 --> 00:29:58,056
so you're not getting back
to Sheila in time.

391
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,125
And Andrew's school,
that's nine minutes

392
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,661
from your house,
15 from your office,

393
00:30:01,694 --> 00:30:03,128
and no one's
getting to him either.

394
00:30:03,162 --> 00:30:05,030
He'll get herded
into the school basement.

395
00:30:06,165 --> 00:30:07,667
I looked up the building plans.

396
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,003
That's a sorry excuse
for a fallout shelter.

397
00:30:11,036 --> 00:30:12,705
Same with your basement,
actually.

398
00:30:12,739 --> 00:30:15,240
Only the government
has decent shelters.

399
00:30:18,444 --> 00:30:19,646
What do you do?

400
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,548
Hmm?

401
00:30:22,948 --> 00:30:24,983
You can spend those four minutes

402
00:30:25,017 --> 00:30:26,118
trying to get Sheila
on the phone

403
00:30:26,151 --> 00:30:27,553
but you won't be able
to get through.

404
00:30:30,255 --> 00:30:32,291
Or you can think about
how you might have helped

405
00:30:32,324 --> 00:30:34,059
stop this from happening...

406
00:30:35,327 --> 00:30:36,629
but you didn't.

407
00:30:40,032 --> 00:30:41,266
And then, that's it.

408
00:30:44,704 --> 00:30:46,038
How dare you.

409
00:30:59,585 --> 00:31:02,187
Truly, we'll be better off
if he doesn't do it.

410
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:04,122
He'll do it.

411
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,525
[doorbell rings]

412
00:31:06,826 --> 00:31:08,260
[Greville] No, I got it.

413
00:31:08,828 --> 00:31:10,028
[Sheila] All right.

414
00:31:12,765 --> 00:31:14,533
- [Alex] Hello.
- Welcome. Do come in.

415
00:31:14,566 --> 00:31:16,368
- Oh! Hello.
- [Alex] Hello.

416
00:31:16,703 --> 00:31:18,638
Oh, vodka, lovely.

417
00:31:18,972 --> 00:31:20,506
I was just saying to Greville
we didn't drink

418
00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:22,140
nearly enough last night.

419
00:31:22,675 --> 00:31:25,778
- Thank you. Uh, do come in.
- [Alex] Thank you.

420
00:31:27,246 --> 00:31:28,380
This is for Andrew.

421
00:31:30,282 --> 00:31:31,617
Very kind, thank you.

422
00:31:32,251 --> 00:31:33,385
This way.

423
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:50,803
Dad told me about Moscow.

424
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:53,372
What's it like in the rest
of Russia?

425
00:31:54,641 --> 00:31:56,141
It is very beautiful.

426
00:31:56,608 --> 00:31:58,143
Especially where I come from.

427
00:31:58,544 --> 00:32:01,681
A lot of trees, a lot of sky.

428
00:32:02,815 --> 00:32:04,116
You feel...

429
00:32:05,551 --> 00:32:08,120
very alone but in a good way.

430
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,822
[Greville] I'd like to see that.

431
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:11,658
But then of course
your government

432
00:32:11,691 --> 00:32:13,392
isn't all that keen
on foreigners

433
00:32:13,425 --> 00:32:15,227
just wandering around.

434
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,832
Do the Russians really hate us
that much?

435
00:32:20,165 --> 00:32:22,568
I think they'd like our children
to be a little more polite,

436
00:32:22,769 --> 00:32:23,836
Andrew.

437
00:32:24,603 --> 00:32:27,272
Our politicians
hate your politicians.

438
00:32:27,306 --> 00:32:29,709
And yours hate ours,
do not forget that.

439
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:34,446
But the people, your father
and I, we do business.

440
00:32:34,948 --> 00:32:38,183
We spend time together,
I meet his family.

441
00:32:39,786 --> 00:32:41,654
Maybe we're only two people...

442
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:44,356
but this is how things change.

443
00:32:46,525 --> 00:32:47,492
[Andrew] Hmm.

444
00:32:51,163 --> 00:32:53,298
- What if I get caught?
- You won't.

445
00:32:53,565 --> 00:32:55,100
You don't know that.

446
00:32:56,736 --> 00:32:58,437
They'd execute me, correct?

447
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:01,340
Not if they thought you're just
a courier that you took packages

448
00:33:01,373 --> 00:33:02,875
but didn't know
what was in them.

449
00:33:02,909 --> 00:33:04,677
They would hold you to trade
for one of theirs.

450
00:33:04,711 --> 00:33:06,144
For how long?

451
00:33:06,612 --> 00:33:08,480
- A couple of years.
- Oh, just a couple of years

452
00:33:08,513 --> 00:33:10,215
rotting in some Russian Gulag.

453
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:14,286
They will not catch us.
The KGB will have no idea.

454
00:33:14,887 --> 00:33:17,657
Listen, I'm better at this
than they are.

455
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,759
Fine. But I'm not.

456
00:33:20,392 --> 00:33:22,494
[Alex] Look, your work...

457
00:33:22,962 --> 00:33:26,699
it is only deception.
Controlling your emotion.

458
00:33:27,265 --> 00:33:29,836
I watched you do it in Moscow,
you did it tonight.

459
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:31,603
It's really not the same thing.

460
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:34,373
If we're caught, they would
definitely execute me.

461
00:33:34,406 --> 00:33:36,241
Well, I'm very sorry
but that's your choice.

462
00:33:36,274 --> 00:33:38,377
[Alex] That is how sure I am
that you can do this.

463
00:33:38,878 --> 00:33:40,647
I'm betting my life on it.

464
00:33:44,249 --> 00:33:45,818
[Greville] How can I explain
this to Sheila?

465
00:33:45,852 --> 00:33:47,386
[Alex]
She cannot know the truth.

466
00:33:48,353 --> 00:33:49,756
For her own safety, for yours.

467
00:33:49,789 --> 00:33:51,490
[Greville]
I can't tell her any of it?

468
00:33:51,523 --> 00:33:52,524
[Alex] No.

469
00:33:52,725 --> 00:33:54,393
Well, what have you told
your wife?

470
00:33:56,929 --> 00:33:59,564
Because you know what she'd say,
"Don't do it."

471
00:33:59,598 --> 00:34:00,733
I'm right, aren't I?

472
00:34:02,467 --> 00:34:05,170
Sheila's no fool.
And in the past, I've...

473
00:34:05,738 --> 00:34:08,540
given her reason
not to trust me dully.

474
00:34:11,276 --> 00:34:12,611
Then you have to lie better.

475
00:34:14,446 --> 00:34:15,547
There are good lies.

476
00:34:16,415 --> 00:34:18,583
Sometimes a lie is gift...

477
00:34:19,551 --> 00:34:20,853
an act of love.

478
00:34:22,287 --> 00:34:23,823
I'm sorry it has to be you.

479
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:27,694
But, Greville...

480
00:34:28,961 --> 00:34:30,395
it has to be you.

481
00:34:35,735 --> 00:34:38,270
<i>In Moscow, you must
at all times</i>

482
00:34:38,303 --> 00:34:39,906
<i>follow the rules of the art.</i>

483
00:34:39,939 --> 00:34:41,606
In English, there's a word.

484
00:34:41,974 --> 00:34:43,710
- Tradecraft.
- [Alex] Yes.

485
00:34:43,976 --> 00:34:45,845
You must follow tradecraft.

486
00:34:46,045 --> 00:34:48,547
<i>Everyone you meet,
assume they are KGB,</i>

487
00:34:48,848 --> 00:34:51,651
<i>waiters, hotel staff,
my driver, everyone.</i>

488
00:34:52,284 --> 00:34:54,586
<i>Even if they are
not actual KGB officers,</i>

489
00:34:54,987 --> 00:34:56,856
<i>they still make reports
to KGB.</i>

490
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:57,622
[Greville] Ooh!

491
00:34:58,024 --> 00:35:00,860
[Alex] <i>Every Russian is an eye
of the state.</i>

492
00:35:01,293 --> 00:35:04,296
<i>Every room you're in,
assume it is bugged.</i>

493
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:05,698
[James] <i>Even inside our embassy.</i>

494
00:35:05,732 --> 00:35:07,734
[Alex]
<i>Especially inside your embassy.</i>

495
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,970
Still, our embassy will be
a good fail-safe

496
00:35:11,003 --> 00:35:12,270
in the event of any...

497
00:35:12,805 --> 00:35:13,840
complication.

498
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,609
[Alex]
<i>The KGB also uses lip readers.</i>

499
00:35:17,643 --> 00:35:19,578
<i>You won't be able to tell
who they are.</i>

500
00:35:19,812 --> 00:35:20,747
- <i>So never discuss...</i>
- [groans]

501
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,281
<i>...anything sensitive
unless I do first.</i>

502
00:35:23,515 --> 00:35:24,549
How's your family?

503
00:35:25,283 --> 00:35:27,619
Very well, thank you.
How's yours?

504
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:30,890
[Alex] <i>We will be seeing
each other often.</i>

505
00:35:32,058 --> 00:35:32,925
<i>To throw off suspicion,</i>

506
00:35:33,325 --> 00:35:36,261
<i>I will tell my colleagues
I recruited you as a source.</i>

507
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,832
[James] <i>You'll keep
Colonel Penkovsky supplied</i>

508
00:35:39,866 --> 00:35:41,968
<i>with material
on steel manufacturing,</i>

509
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:43,836
<i>industrial production
and so on.</i>

510
00:35:44,503 --> 00:35:47,372
<i>Unclassified,
but hard to come by.</i>

511
00:35:47,774 --> 00:35:49,541
[Greville] <i>They'll believe
I would do that?</i>

512
00:35:50,676 --> 00:35:51,677
[Alex] <i>Of course.</i>

513
00:35:52,344 --> 00:35:54,379
<i>You are a greedy capitalist.</i>

514
00:35:54,781 --> 00:35:56,783
<i>You want to keep
the contracts coming.</i>

515
00:35:57,549 --> 00:36:00,887
<i>And from now on, every moment
you're in Moscow,</i>

516
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,955
<i>you will be selling one thing.</i>

517
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:07,425
<i>The idea that you are
an ordinary businessman</i>

518
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:09,896
<i>and nothing more
than an ordinary businessman.</i>

519

Well, gentlemen, I hope

this is the first of many.
Thank you all very, very much.

of dealing with the Brits.
How is it with those assholes?

548
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,871

I told you to pack
the raincoats,

it doesn't mean
he's having an affair now.

646
00:45:05,597 --> 00:45:07,433

[Greville] Darling, I told you,
it's very important.

654
00:45:23,148 --> 00:45:24,249
- We need the money.
- [Sheila] The money?

655
00:45:24,283 --> 00:45:26,418
- [Greville] Money, yes.
- I thought you needed the club?

656
00:45:26,452 --> 00:45:27,886
And you haven't caught
any expenses

657
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,455

to a smart restaurant.

how I'm supposed

659

We cannot invite you for dinner.

673
00:46:15,033 --> 00:46:18,070
To bring a foreigner
into one's home, it is not done.

674
00:46:18,671 --> 00:46:21,273
It's all right. I'd understand.

when do you think
you'll be ready to defect?

680

[Alex] It is best if we
do not talk about that.

681
00:46:44,363 --> 00:46:45,497
Is something the matter?

682
00:46:47,433 --> 00:46:48,967
Just a bit of trouble at home.

684
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:52,604
One day, you will be able
to tell Sheila

685
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:55,007
what you have done
and she'll be very proud of you.

686
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,442
That might be a bit too late.

687
00:46:56,942 --> 00:47:00,412
Sometimes Vera,
she also struggles with my work.

688
00:47:00,446 --> 00:47:01,748
Yes, but your wife married
a soldier,

my government will not let you

They want to hide the suffering.

692
00:47:14,794 --> 00:47:16,528
In the city life is all right,

693
00:47:16,562 --> 00:47:18,330
but in the country
where I'm from...

694
00:47:18,798 --> 00:47:21,166
I do not want this life
for Nina.

695
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,535
I want her to be free
from the State.

696
00:47:24,704 --> 00:47:28,741
Someday, if our work succeeds,
when I feel the danger is over,

697
00:47:29,141 --> 00:47:30,576
then I will defect.

698
00:47:31,276 --> 00:47:33,345
I will bring my family
to Montana.

699
00:47:34,012 --> 00:47:36,381
- Montana?
- Yeah. I've seen some pictures,

700
00:47:36,415 --> 00:47:38,751
it is beautiful
like where I grew up.

701
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,387
Perhaps, I will become a cowboy.

702
00:47:42,889 --> 00:47:45,090

703
00:47:45,624 --> 00:47:48,427

- Yes.

705
00:47:52,397 --> 00:47:53,766

706
00:47:54,634 --> 00:47:56,168

No. It's all way above

- [Greville] Yes.

01:03:10,582 --> 01:03:13,585
[Greville] And if they
won't let them leave, then what?

865
01:03:15,521 --> 01:03:17,456
[James] It was my idea
to bring you into all this.

866
01:03:17,489 --> 01:03:19,525
I never should have done that
to you. I'm sorry.

867
01:03:24,096 --> 01:03:25,431
Well then, that's it?

868
01:03:29,301 --> 01:03:31,336
We're just going to abandon him
and let the KGB murder him

869
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:32,504
whenever they get round to it?

870
01:03:32,705 --> 01:03:34,339
This is a hard truth.

871
01:03:34,741 --> 01:03:37,009
But if things were
the other way around,

872
01:03:37,042 --> 01:03:39,578
- Penkovsky would abandon you.
- No. No, he would not.

873
01:03:39,611 --> 01:03:41,313
He's a professional.
We use people.

874
01:03:41,346 --> 01:03:43,348
He would do
just what I'm doing now.

875
01:03:43,582 --> 01:03:45,617
Move on. Go home.

876
01:03:47,319 --> 01:03:48,954
Go home to your family.

877
01:03:57,129 --> 01:03:58,297
You're wrong.

878
01:03:59,699 --> 01:04:00,700
What?

879
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:06,739
You're the experts on spying
and tradecraft and all of that,

880
01:04:06,773 --> 01:04:09,475
but not Penkovsky.
You've met him once, I know him.

881
01:04:10,142 --> 01:04:12,611
He would never leave me to die.

882
01:04:12,946 --> 01:04:13,847
And I'm not leaving him.

883
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:14,881
[James] I'm afraid
it's not your decision.

884
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:18,183
You said the problem was,
there's no way to coordinate

885
01:04:18,217 --> 01:04:20,085
to let Penkovsky know about
the escape plan

886
01:04:20,118 --> 01:04:21,453
but there is a way.

887
01:04:22,254 --> 01:04:23,255
Me.

888
01:04:24,223 --> 01:04:25,357
I can tell him...

889
01:04:26,659 --> 01:04:28,227
if I go back to Moscow.

890
01:04:29,161 --> 01:04:30,395
- You would do that?
- Yes.

891
01:04:30,429 --> 01:04:31,163
[James] No, he wouldn't.

892
01:04:31,396 --> 01:04:33,198
Because he hasn't entirely
lost his mind.

893
01:04:33,232 --> 01:04:34,533
James, be a bloody professional.

894
01:04:34,566 --> 01:04:36,435

the best source

are on the brink of nuclear war.

You talk about using people,
for God's sake use me.

898
01:04:49,749 --> 01:04:51,651
If you go back to Moscow,
I'll go with you.

899
01:04:51,684 --> 01:04:54,586
At no risk to herself.
She'll have diplomatic immunity.

900
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:56,588
- She thinks you're a fool.
- [Helen] I will do everything

901
01:04:56,622 --> 01:04:58,390
in my power to get both of you

902
01:04:58,423 --> 01:04:59,826
- out of there.
- [James] But I am telling you,

903
01:04:59,859 --> 01:05:01,360
don't do it.

staying tonight?

1039
01:23:12,484 --> 01:23:13,552
in some sort of...

1040
01:23:14,754 --> 01:23:16,154
well, espionage.

1041
01:23:17,657 --> 01:23:19,458
The Foreign Office will be
in touch soon.

1042
01:23:19,491 --> 01:23:21,193
And while
this is all being resolved,

1043
01:23:21,226 --> 01:23:23,362
The Crown will provide
for you and your son.

1044
01:23:23,395 --> 01:23:25,865
- It's true, isn't it?
- What's true?

1045
01:23:25,898 --> 01:23:28,333
Greville was working
with Penkovsky like they say?

1046
01:23:28,367 --> 01:23:29,102
[James] No, no. Of course not.

1047
01:23:29,368 --> 01:23:30,435
Can I call Greville,
I need to speak to him.

1048
01:23:30,469 --> 01:23:32,639
- I don't think that's...
- No, I have to... I have to...

1049
01:23:32,672 --> 01:23:34,473
I have to tell him that
I'm sorry.

1050
01:23:35,207 --> 01:23:37,744
[breathing heavily]
I thought he was...

1051
01:23:39,211 --> 01:23:41,313
- My God, I've been so stupid.
- [door opens]

1052
01:23:41,648 --> 01:23:43,415
- [Andrew] Mommy?
- Andrew, go to your room.

1053
01:23:43,650 --> 01:23:45,617
- [Andrew] Who are...
- Andrew, go to your room!

1054
01:23:45,652 --> 01:23:46,686
[James]
I'm a friend of your father's.

1055
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:49,621
He told me you have
quite the trophy collection.

1056
01:23:49,656 --> 01:23:50,923
Could you show me?

1057
01:23:53,625 --> 01:23:55,260
Andrew please, it's all right.

1058
01:24:02,702 --> 01:24:03,770
[door closes]

1059
01:24:03,803 --> 01:24:05,404
Don't tell me it's not true.

1060
01:24:06,571 --> 01:24:07,940
I know my husband.

1061
01:24:09,508 --> 01:24:10,777
I know he's been acting.

1062
01:24:12,912 --> 01:24:14,546
Don't tell me it's not true.

1063
01:24:18,017 --> 01:24:19,952
There are things
I can't say to you.

1064
01:24:31,998 --> 01:24:37,235
I can tell you that your husband
is an incredibly brave man.

1065
01:24:38,603 --> 01:24:40,640
And he needs you now.

1066
01:24:41,674 --> 01:24:43,710
He needs your help, Mrs. Wynne.

1067
01:24:44,509 --> 01:24:48,580
You see, once the Russians
realize Greville is innocent,

1068
01:24:48,881 --> 01:24:51,450
your government will be able
to get him home safe.

1069
01:24:52,051 --> 01:24:53,251
In time.

1070
01:24:54,687 --> 01:24:56,856
But if the Russians do decide...

1071
01:24:57,456 --> 01:25:00,760
that Greville actually
is some kind of spy...

1072
01:25:03,863 --> 01:25:04,997
I'm so sorry.

1073
01:25:06,498 --> 01:25:07,466
[scoffs]

1074
01:25:08,333 --> 01:25:09,969
[Helen]
So when you talk to anybody...

1075
01:25:11,403 --> 01:25:13,305
that means your family...

1076
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:17,009
your friends, Andrew,
and especially the press...

1077
01:25:19,746 --> 01:25:21,346
you have to tell them
that none of this

1078
01:25:21,379 --> 01:25:22,682
could possibly be true.

1079
01:25:23,015 --> 01:25:25,283
And you have to be
very convincing.

1080
01:25:29,055 --> 01:25:30,355
Can you do that?

1081
01:25:35,762 --> 01:25:37,496
Can you do that for Greville?

1082
01:25:44,603 --> 01:25:47,907
I can't imagine what Penkovsky
could've confessed to.

1083
01:25:56,849 --> 01:25:59,384
I... I'm sorry,
I don't know what this is.

1084
01:26:00,418 --> 01:26:01,687
We know everything,

1085
01:26:01,721 --> 01:26:05,357
we know that Penkovsky gave you
packages to take to the West.

1086
01:26:05,624 --> 01:26:08,493
- Well, yes, a few times.
- Then you admit it.

1087
01:26:09,929 --> 01:26:13,598
Admit what? I didn't know
that I was doing anything wrong?

1088
01:26:13,633 --> 01:26:15,668
You think stealing
Soviet intelligence

1089
01:26:15,701 --> 01:26:16,401
wasn't wrong?

1090
01:26:16,936 --> 01:26:19,906
[Greville] If that is what
was happening, I didn't know it.

1091
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:22,909
I never asked him
what was in the packages,

1092
01:26:22,942 --> 01:26:24,376
I didn't think
it was my business.

1093
01:26:24,409 --> 01:26:26,411
Who did you give these
packages to?

1094
01:26:26,444 --> 01:26:27,780
[Greville]
Well, I dropped them off

1095
01:26:27,814 --> 01:26:29,649
in various addresses
around London,

1096
01:26:29,682 --> 01:26:31,583
I never thought anything of it.

1097
01:26:34,687 --> 01:26:35,822
Mr. Wynne...

1098
01:26:36,856 --> 01:26:40,592
you were asking me to believe
that you are very, very stupid.

1099
01:26:40,893 --> 01:26:43,395
[Greville] Oh, well, yes.

1100
01:26:43,428 --> 01:26:47,432
I suppose in your world I am,
but, look, I'm just a salesman.

1101
01:26:48,567 --> 01:26:52,805
I want my clients to like me,
so if that meant doing...

1102
01:26:53,371 --> 01:26:55,675
a favor for Penkovsky
every now and then,

1103
01:26:55,708 --> 01:26:57,977
I really didn't see the harm.

1104
01:27:16,128 --> 01:27:17,697
[exhales]

1105
01:27:45,658 --> 01:27:47,093
[groans]

1106
01:29:04,203 --> 01:29:05,204
Hi.

1107
01:29:07,139 --> 01:29:10,009
- Ah! That is so sweet of you.
- [chuckles]

1108
01:29:10,042 --> 01:29:12,510
Oh, but I wish I could
invite you in, I'm just...

1109
01:29:12,878 --> 01:29:13,779
I'm in the middle of 20 things.

1110
01:29:14,046 --> 01:29:17,783
Oh, no, no. That's fine.
I'm so glad to see you're well.

1111
01:29:17,817 --> 01:29:19,885
It's been ages,
we've all been worried.

1112
01:29:19,919 --> 01:29:21,821
Yes, well, do say hello for me.

1113
01:29:21,854 --> 01:29:25,191
Of course. I saw that ridiculous
piece in the <i>Mail.</i>

1114
01:29:25,391 --> 01:29:26,759
It's so absurd.

1115
01:29:27,793 --> 01:29:30,628
You don't think there could be
any truth to it, do you?

1116
01:29:30,830 --> 01:29:32,530
What they're saying
about Greville?

1117
01:29:32,564 --> 01:29:34,000
Don't be ridiculous.

1118
01:29:34,467 --> 01:29:36,702
How could Greville ever spy
on Soviets,

1119
01:29:36,736 --> 01:29:38,536
he couldn't even hide
his affair for me.

1120
01:29:38,738 --> 01:29:40,039
- Right.
- Thank you again for dropping by

1121
01:29:40,072 --> 01:29:41,807
- and this was so sweet of you.
- Oh.

1122
01:29:41,841 --> 01:29:42,942
We should have tea.

1123
01:29:42,975 --> 01:29:44,576
- I'll be in touch. Thank you.
- Yes!

1124
01:29:44,609 --> 01:29:48,014
Oh, all right. Bye.
[clears throat]

1125
01:29:51,283 --> 01:29:56,789
- [bulb buzzing]
- [breathing heavily]

1126
01:30:07,833 --> 01:30:11,804
[Oleg] For years the Americans
have had the nuclear missiles

1127
01:30:11,837 --> 01:30:13,205
in Turkey...

1128
01:30:14,106 --> 01:30:17,009
aimed right at us.

1129
01:30:19,011 --> 01:30:23,049
Oh, but how dare
we put missiles in Cuba...

1130
01:30:24,616 --> 01:30:25,785
is that fair?

1131
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:29,188
- I don't know.
- Mm.

1132
01:30:29,822 --> 01:30:33,625
Do you realize your country
has left you here to die?

1133
01:30:35,327 --> 01:30:37,797
No, sir,
I don't believe that's true.

1134
01:30:41,834 --> 01:30:43,202
[indistinct]

1135
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:54,313
Why?

1136
01:30:55,681 --> 01:30:56,682
Why?

1137
01:30:57,349 --> 01:31:02,321
Why? For God sake.
What have I done? [banging]

1138
01:31:02,521 --> 01:31:05,091
I didn't do anything.

1139
01:31:06,292 --> 01:31:11,363
I didn't do it, you...
you fucking animals!

1140
01:31:54,707 --> 01:31:57,309
[sobs]

1141
01:32:10,723 --> 01:32:12,791
[cell door opens]

1142
01:32:23,269 --> 01:32:24,236
[Greville gasps]

1143
01:32:27,306 --> 01:32:29,275
[officer]
You will not touch. Sit down.

1144
01:32:31,277 --> 01:32:32,444
Sit down.

1145
01:32:40,219 --> 01:32:41,854
Oh, my God, darling.

1146
01:32:43,222 --> 01:32:46,258
I know I've been ill,
but I'm on the mend now...

1147
01:32:49,094 --> 01:32:50,362
and this will help.

1148
01:32:52,064 --> 01:32:53,098
This will help.

1149
01:32:53,933 --> 01:32:55,734
- Very much.
- What are they doing?

1150
01:32:55,768 --> 01:32:57,069
What the hell are you people
doing to him?

1151
01:32:57,102 --> 01:32:58,437
[Greville] It's not like that.

1152
01:32:58,737 --> 01:33:02,241
They've been quite respectful
given the circumstance.

1153
01:33:04,176 --> 01:33:05,411
You mustn't fault them.

1154
01:33:06,946 --> 01:33:08,480
Really. You mustn't.

1155
01:33:11,217 --> 01:33:12,484
What you're going through...

1156
01:33:14,119 --> 01:33:15,387
it's all so unfair.

1157
01:33:16,288 --> 01:33:17,957
I'm sorry for what happened.

1158
01:33:19,825 --> 01:33:21,260
I feel wretched
for doubting you.

1159
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:24,330
No, no. Couldn't be helped.

1160
01:33:29,802 --> 01:33:33,138
I'm really so glad you're here.
I missed you both...

1161
01:33:34,506 --> 01:33:35,841
very much.

1162
01:33:36,375 --> 01:33:38,177
The foreign office said,
that's a very good sign

1163
01:33:38,210 --> 01:33:39,845
I'm being allowed to visit you.

1164
01:33:40,512 --> 01:33:43,315
- Hmm.
- [Sheila] They said it might...

1165
01:33:43,349 --> 01:33:46,852
it might still take a while yet
to get you home

1166
01:33:47,654 --> 01:33:49,488
since the Russians backed down
in Cuba

1167
01:33:49,521 --> 01:33:50,889
they're being very stubborn
right now.

1168
01:33:50,923 --> 01:33:52,358
What happened in Cuba?

1169
01:33:52,391 --> 01:33:55,127
Well, they removed the missiles.
It's... It's all fine now.

1170
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:56,395
No more about this.

1171
01:34:13,579 --> 01:34:15,347
[Sheila]
And we're trying very hard.

1172
01:34:17,549 --> 01:34:18,817
It might take another...

1173
01:34:20,052 --> 01:34:21,320
it might take another year...

1174
01:34:22,321 --> 01:34:23,422
or two.

1175
01:34:31,597 --> 01:34:33,299
Tell me something about home.

1176
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:36,135
Tell me what I have
to look forward to.

1177
01:34:39,505 --> 01:34:41,473
Well, the garden's cooperating
a bit.

1178
01:34:41,974 --> 01:34:43,809
Finally. [chuckles]

1179
01:34:44,644 --> 01:34:47,112
And we have tomatoes this year.

1180
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:51,050
And Andrew, he...

1181
01:34:51,950 --> 01:34:53,319
he passed his Maths exam

1182
01:34:53,585 --> 01:34:55,154
- somehow. [chuckles]
- [chuckles]

1183
01:34:57,156 --> 01:34:58,190
You'd be proud.

1184
01:35:04,496 --> 01:35:05,898
How are you?

1185
01:35:07,333 --> 01:35:08,334
I'm...

1186
01:35:09,535 --> 01:35:10,569
I'm all right.

1187
01:35:12,071 --> 01:35:13,138
Really.

1188
01:35:15,474 --> 01:35:17,343
If you can be strong enough
for this...

1189
01:35:22,682 --> 01:35:24,116
when you come home...

1190
01:35:26,552 --> 01:35:28,354
I hope we can start again.

1191
01:35:36,528 --> 01:35:38,597
And I was very foolish.

1192
01:35:40,299 --> 01:35:41,300
I'm sorry.

1193
01:35:44,002 --> 01:35:48,073
But I just want you to know that
every moment I've been here,

1194
01:35:48,273 --> 01:35:50,342
I have done nothing
but think about

1195
01:35:50,376 --> 01:35:52,878
how I'm going to get home
to you.

1196
01:35:57,616 --> 01:35:58,617
Really.

1197
01:36:03,589 --> 01:36:04,590
I will.

1198
01:36:07,459 --> 01:36:09,495
I will. [snivels]

1199
01:36:17,704 --> 01:36:19,405
[man] <i>It's a matter of who.</i>

1200
01:36:20,572 --> 01:36:23,008
We can't send someone
of real value.

1201
01:36:30,015 --> 01:36:31,016
Not for Wynne.

1202
01:36:31,718 --> 01:36:33,285
Wynne wasn't valuable?

1203
01:36:33,653 --> 01:36:35,421
We're all alive, aren't we?

1204
01:36:35,755 --> 01:36:38,056
He's not an officer,
is the point.

1205
01:36:38,323 --> 01:36:41,360
If we propose an officer
of theirs that sends a message

1206
01:36:41,393 --> 01:36:44,062
about how we perceive Wynne
the wrong message.

1207
01:36:44,997 --> 01:36:48,701
If you let Wynne die over there,
and he will die,

1208
01:36:48,902 --> 01:36:50,703
a lot sooner than you think.

1209
01:36:51,069 --> 01:36:54,306
No one will ever trust MI6
to protect them.

1210
01:36:54,707 --> 01:36:55,941
Ever again.

1211
01:36:57,710 --> 01:36:58,711
[James sighs]

1212
01:36:59,445 --> 01:37:00,579
You feel guilty.

1213
01:37:02,047 --> 01:37:03,048
I know.

1214
01:37:03,783 --> 01:37:05,517
But you were doing your job
and Wynne

1215
01:37:05,551 --> 01:37:07,519
is our countryman, Emily.
I promise...

1216
01:37:09,054 --> 01:37:10,322
we'll get him home.

1217
01:37:19,766 --> 01:37:22,434
[Oleg] If you think Penkovsky
will protect you...

1218
01:37:23,101 --> 01:37:25,437
you think too highly of him.

1219
01:37:27,372 --> 01:37:29,141
He betrayed his country...

1220
01:37:31,043 --> 01:37:32,077
his family...

1221
01:37:33,512 --> 01:37:34,647
why not you?

1222
01:37:39,485 --> 01:37:42,488
It is every man for himself.
Yes?

1223
01:38:00,272 --> 01:38:01,273
Hi.

1224
01:38:04,376 --> 01:38:07,145
I have not seen a mirror
for a long time.

1225
01:38:10,717 --> 01:38:13,185
I like to think
I'm still quite worth...

1226
01:38:14,854 --> 01:38:16,388
for the time.

1227
01:38:18,490 --> 01:38:21,093
I wasn't sure
I'd ever see you again.

1228
01:38:23,128 --> 01:38:25,163
I'm so sorry
you're here Greville.

1229
01:38:28,133 --> 01:38:31,537
I hope you can forgive me
for this...

1230
01:38:34,139 --> 01:38:35,675
and for what I had to do.

1231
01:38:37,543 --> 01:38:39,812
What you mean,
what you had to do?

1232
01:38:45,517 --> 01:38:46,686
I held back...

1233
01:38:49,187 --> 01:38:50,723
<i>for as long as I could.</i>

1234
01:38:52,157 --> 01:38:54,426
<i>I have to protect
my family, Greville.</i>

1235
01:38:56,161 --> 01:38:59,431
To save them, I had to tell
the KGB the truth.

1236
01:39:01,300 --> 01:39:02,702
All of the truth.

1237
01:39:08,206 --> 01:39:09,308
I told them...

1238
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:13,312
I gave you pictures that...

1239
01:39:13,913 --> 01:39:17,082
helped Americans
find missiles in Cuba.

1240
01:39:28,226 --> 01:39:29,729
And of course I told them...

1241
01:39:31,330 --> 01:39:33,766
you didn't know what was
in the packages I gave you.

1242
01:39:52,852 --> 01:39:53,786
Greville...

1243
01:39:57,322 --> 01:40:00,793
I thought I could make
the world a safer place...

1244
01:40:04,529 --> 01:40:05,632
but I failed.

1245
01:40:07,299 --> 01:40:08,300
All this...

1246
01:40:11,236 --> 01:40:12,672
betraying my country,

1247
01:40:13,305 --> 01:40:16,743
my people, all for nothing.

1248
01:40:19,544 --> 01:40:20,647
Alex...

1249
01:40:28,253 --> 01:40:29,922
of course I forgive you.

1250
01:40:32,290 --> 01:40:34,761
I have to look
after my family, too.

1251
01:40:36,495 --> 01:40:38,563
Easier now I know
there's not gonna be

1252
01:40:38,597 --> 01:40:39,932
a nuclear war...

1253
01:40:41,366 --> 01:40:43,636
because Khrushchev
withdrew his missiles...

1254
01:40:43,836 --> 01:40:46,673
- [cell door opens]
- ...because of you.

1255
01:40:47,073 --> 01:40:48,407
Because of you.

1256
01:40:49,474 --> 01:40:50,475
You.

1257
01:40:51,044 --> 01:40:54,279
You did it, Alex. You did it.

1258
01:40:54,781 --> 01:40:56,816
You. You did it.

1259
01:40:57,784 --> 01:40:59,819
Because of you, Alex.

1260
01:41:00,585 --> 01:41:01,688
<i>You did it.</i>

1261
01:41:58,811 --> 01:42:01,814
[indistinct chatter]

1262
01:42:38,818 --> 01:42:40,653
[Alex]
<i>Maybe we're only two people...</i>

1263
01:42:45,758 --> 01:42:47,392
but this is how things change.

1264
01:42:59,404 --> 01:43:01,974
[Andrew] Daddy, where are you?

1265
01:44:11,043 --> 01:44:12,712
[man] <i>Mr. Wynne, you've just
spoken to your wife,</i>

1266
01:44:12,745 --> 01:44:14,013
<i>what were your first words
to her</i>

1267
01:44:14,046 --> 01:44:15,580
and what were her first
words to you?

1268
01:44:15,614 --> 01:44:17,650
Frankly,
we're both rather speechless.

1269
01:44:17,683 --> 01:44:18,985
There were no words
for a moment.

1270
01:44:19,218 --> 01:44:21,120
[man] Do you have any idea
of what you're going to do

1271
01:44:21,153 --> 01:44:22,587
in the future?

1272
01:44:22,889 --> 01:44:26,659
Oh, I want to get back
to my normal business activities

1273
01:44:26,692 --> 01:44:28,761
as soon as I possibly can.

1274
01:44:28,794 --> 01:44:30,428
[man] Well, is that
to the same company?

1275
01:44:31,964 --> 01:44:33,565
With my own company.

1276
01:44:33,598 --> 01:44:35,433
[man 2] Will you travel
in East Europe again?

1277
01:44:35,635 --> 01:44:37,069
Oh, now,
that is quite a question

1278
01:44:37,103 --> 01:44:39,537
which I can't answer today.

1279
01:44:39,571 --> 01:44:43,075
