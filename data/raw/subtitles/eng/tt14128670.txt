<i>Tell our viewers what the
main difference is, in your mind</i>

3
00:00:23,271 --> 00:00:26,941
<i>between Kimi and products
like Siri or Alexa.</i>

4
00:00:27,024 --> 00:00:31,237
<i>Well, Sharon, I will tell you
the difference between Kimi and those</i>

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,822
<i>other products you mention
by name. People.</i>

6
00:00:33,906 --> 00:00:37,660
<i>It's our people and their level
of excellence that sets us apart.</i>

7
00:00:37,743 --> 00:00:40,621
<i>The voice interpolation on Kimi
is a perfect example.</i>

8
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:44,707
We don't have an algorithm trying to
figure out what you said or what you meant.

9
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:47,794
We have actual people
analyzing Kimi requests

10
00:00:47,877 --> 00:00:51,798
so we can continually update our
understanding of how you communicate,

11
00:00:51,881 --> 00:00:53,967
who you are, what you want.

12
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,885
<i>So you're listening
to everything?</i>

13
00:00:55,969 --> 00:01:01,640
No. Not at all. We are flagging miscommunication
so Kimi can better understand you.

14
00:01:01,723 --> 00:01:03,558
And we do this every day.

15
00:01:03,642 --> 00:01:07,020
Think of it this way. Kimi understands
you better today than it did yesterday

16
00:01:07,104 --> 00:01:08,563
because of our people.

17
00:01:08,647 --> 00:01:10,315
<i>Is that efficient?</i>

18
00:01:10,399 --> 00:01:13,944
It's actually the fastest way to get
better fast, if that makes any sense.

19
00:01:14,027 --> 00:01:16,738
The bottom line is,
it's working.

20
00:01:16,822 --> 00:01:19,782
<i>You pushed for the Amygdala
Corporation to go public,</i>

21
00:01:19,865 --> 00:01:23,786
<i>the idea, the timing, mostly yours.
How are you feeling?</i>

22
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:25,162
I feel great.

23
00:01:25,246 --> 00:01:27,290
I've been saying since I was
brought in two years ago,

24
00:01:27,373 --> 00:01:29,292
Kimi is the future
of this company.

25
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:31,877
It just seemed obvious to me,
and the board agrees.

26
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:35,338
But talk to me in a week, after the
IPO, if you'll give me the time.

27
00:01:35,422 --> 00:01:37,340
<i>I absolutely will.</i>

28
00:01:37,424 --> 00:01:40,844
<i>Bradley Hasling, CEO of the Amygdala
Corporation, thank you for joining us.</i>

29
00:01:40,927 --> 00:01:42,679
<i>We know it's early
there in Seattle.</i>

30
00:01:52,938 --> 00:01:54,398
Oh, Jess.

31
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,150
I was up.

32
00:01:59,778 --> 00:02:01,488
I forgot you had Sharon.

33
00:02:02,531 --> 00:02:04,325
- Is he awake?
- No.

34
00:02:04,408 --> 00:02:06,285
I'll do it.

35
00:02:06,368 --> 00:02:07,786
Did she ask you how much
you would pocket?

36
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,371
Oh, she knows
I wouldn't answer that.

37
00:02:10,455 --> 00:02:13,124
Where'd they set
the share price? Twenty-eight?

38
00:02:15,418 --> 00:02:16,419
Thirty-one.

39
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:20,590
Which would put us
north of...

40
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:22,300
I can't count that high.

41
00:02:36,188 --> 00:02:37,647
Yes?

42
00:02:37,731 --> 00:02:40,150
<i>You can
transfer the second payment now.</i>

43
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:43,819
Jesus.

44
00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:46,739
Okay.

45
00:02:47,865 --> 00:02:50,117
And no chance of discovery?

46
00:02:50,826 --> 00:02:52,453
<i>Of her? No.</i>

47
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,834
<i>You there?</i>

48
00:02:58,918 --> 00:03:01,086
You'll have it within the hour.

49
00:04:30,295 --> 00:04:32,839
- Kimi.
- <i>I'm here!</i>

50
00:04:32,922 --> 00:04:34,007
What time is it?

51
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,677
<i>It's 7:26 a.m.,
Pacific Daylight Time.</i>

52
00:04:38,553 --> 00:04:40,054
You're gonna be late.

53
00:05:06,454 --> 00:05:10,625
<i>Well, today will be the sixth consecutive
day of protests over the city's</i>

54
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,418
<i>so-called Homeless Safe Zones.</i>

55
00:05:12,502 --> 00:05:14,879
<i>The demonstrations
and counter-demonstrations</i>

56
00:05:14,962 --> 00:05:18,006
<i>were centered in the downtown
area near official buildings...</i>

57
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:20,467
- Kimi.
- <i>I'm here!</i>

58
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,553
Mute TV, play "Oxytocin."

59
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:15,828
- Kimi?
- <i>I'm here!</i>

60
00:10:15,912 --> 00:10:18,539
Open yesterday's stream
on desktop.

61
00:10:36,097 --> 00:10:37,974
Oh, no.

62
00:10:38,058 --> 00:10:42,686
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

63
00:10:47,608 --> 00:10:48,818
<i>Hello?</i>

64
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:51,028
Marcos, it's Angela.
I thought we had an agreement.

65
00:10:51,111 --> 00:10:55,074
I know, but I got the carpet guy coming,
and the tackless strip went down all wrong.

66
00:10:55,157 --> 00:10:56,534
I just need
a couple of hours.

67
00:10:56,617 --> 00:10:58,077
I get it,
I have deadlines too,

68
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,204
which is why we agreed 9:00 a.m.
to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays,

69
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:03,790
10:00 to 5:00 on Saturdays,
and never on Sundays.

70
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:06,543
- Please don't do that.
- <i>Do what?</i>

71
00:11:06,626 --> 00:11:11,589
Say the same thing over and over again until
I can't take it anymore and I give up.

72
00:11:11,673 --> 00:11:14,592
All I'm doing
is reminding you

73
00:11:14,676 --> 00:11:18,220
that you said 9:00 a.m.
to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays,

74
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:21,265
- <i>10:00 to 5:00 on Saturdays, and never on...</i>
- Okay! Okay, okay.

75
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,894
Hold the work, guys.

76
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:28,146
Try a wide putty knife
to get the strips up,

77
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,357
and don't use
a nail gun next time.

78
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,734
<i>Whoa,
what are you, in the business?</i>

79
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,904
My dad was.

80
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,239
He did my place.

81
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,200
<i>Maybe I should talk to him.</i>

82
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,911
You can't.

83
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:47,373
Just let me know whenever
you're gonna go out, will you?

84
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,041
Yep. Thanks. Bye.

85
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:58,550
- <i>Kimi.</i>
- <i>I'm here!</i>

86
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:02,470
<i>Put more kitchen paper
in the cart for next time.</i>

87
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:06,474
<i>One possibility is Green
Kitchen, on Decatur Street.</i>

88
00:12:06,558 --> 00:12:09,810
<i>No!
I need more kitchen paper.</i>

89
00:12:21,113 --> 00:12:23,574
- <i>Kimi.</i>
- <i>I'm here!</i>

90
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:26,034
<i>Play "Me,"
Taylor Swift.</i>

91
00:12:26,117 --> 00:12:29,412
<i>Creating personalized
station of Taylor Swift songs.</i>

92
00:12:29,495 --> 00:12:32,498
<i>No! I just
want to hear "Me!"</i>

93
00:12:32,582 --> 00:12:34,167
<i>I'm listening.</i>

94
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,045
- <i>Play...</i>
- <i>Tell me what's on your mind.</i>

95
00:12:45,969 --> 00:12:48,555
- <i>Hey, Kimi.</i>
- <i>I'm here!</i>

96
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,307
<i>You're a peckerwood.</i>

97
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:54,019
<i>I don't know what you
mean by "You're a peckerwood."</i>

98
00:12:54,102 --> 00:12:57,439
<i>It means
you're a big wooden dick.</i>

99
00:13:25,173 --> 00:13:28,510
- <i>Hi, sweetie.</i>
- Hi. Do you have time to talk?

100
00:13:28,593 --> 00:13:31,680
<i>Um, a little. What's wrong?</i>

101
00:13:31,763 --> 00:13:35,015
What? Nothing.
I don't know, nothing. I...

102
00:13:37,142 --> 00:13:39,311
<i>Is there something specific?</i>

103
00:13:40,312 --> 00:13:42,272
No.

104
00:13:42,356 --> 00:13:44,775
I'm sorry I bothered you. God.

105
00:13:45,734 --> 00:13:48,028
<i>Okay. Can we start over?</i>

106
00:13:48,112 --> 00:13:49,655
<i>Good morning, my darling.</i>

107
00:13:51,781 --> 00:13:54,534
So, you know the guy
from across the street?

108
00:13:56,285 --> 00:13:58,287
<i>Yes.</i>

109
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:02,792
<i>I'm not sure I approve of you waving in
the window like a hooker in Amsterdam,</i>

110
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,169
<i>but, uh, I know who you mean.</i>

111
00:14:05,253 --> 00:14:09,047
Mom, it was lockdown.
Everyone was in the window.

112
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,633
<i>What about the guy?</i>

113
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:16,346
I asked him to meet me
for breakfast.

114
00:14:18,473 --> 00:14:19,933
<i>Out?</i>

115
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:22,519
- <i>Good!</i>
- No.

116
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,771
I didn't... I didn't go,

117
00:14:24,854 --> 00:14:27,565
but I tried.

118
00:14:30,568 --> 00:14:35,197
<i>I don't know what you want me to say,
other than the things I always say.</i>

119
00:14:35,281 --> 00:14:37,408
I don't want you
to say anything. I don't...

120
00:14:38,451 --> 00:14:40,494
<i>Did you try that Turn2Me group?</i>

121
00:14:42,871 --> 00:14:44,372
Okay.

122
00:14:44,456 --> 00:14:46,207
- <i>The Zoom one?</i>
- Yes.

123
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:49,544
- <i>Roman read about.</i>
- I know the one. Please stop.

124
00:14:50,462 --> 00:14:53,465
<i>Oh, God. I would love to.</i>

125
00:14:54,632 --> 00:14:55,717
Okay. Bye, Mom.

126
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,007
<i>Angela?</i>

127
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:42,677
<i>Angela? Hello?</i>

128
00:15:44,221 --> 00:15:46,389
<i>Do you hear me, Angela?</i>

129
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:48,767
Yeah.

130
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,310
- <i>Did you find it?</i>
- Yeah!

131
00:15:51,393 --> 00:15:54,980
<i>The black sigma repeater
with the six inputs! Yeah?</i>

132
00:15:55,064 --> 00:15:59,068
No, yeah, I know,
but I think I had a bad cable too.

133
00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:00,528
<i>Ah, okay.</i>

134
00:16:02,655 --> 00:16:05,407
- All right, rebooting now.
- <i>Okay.</i>

135
00:16:08,743 --> 00:16:10,161
Thanks, Darius.

136
00:16:10,245 --> 00:16:12,205
<i>Anything
for you, Hotness.</i>

137
00:16:12,288 --> 00:16:14,499
You can't say
that shit anymore, Darius.

138
00:16:14,582 --> 00:16:18,253
<i>Ah, this is Romania.
MeToo is like 50 years away.</i>

139
00:16:18,336 --> 00:16:19,712
<i>Stay on, let's have a drink.</i>

140
00:16:19,796 --> 00:16:21,840
Isn't it like 6:00
in the morning for you?

141
00:16:21,923 --> 00:16:24,425
<i>Oh, is it? I didn't notice.</i>

142
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:25,926
Thanks for the help.

143
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:27,219
<i>Please don't leave me.
No! Don't...</i>

144
00:18:15,613 --> 00:18:17,156
I'm here to install the cable.

145
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,658
You didn't buzz downstairs.

146
00:18:18,741 --> 00:18:21,994
- Somebody was coming out.
- You're still supposed to buzz.

147
00:18:22,078 --> 00:18:24,121
But if somebody's coming out and
you know I'm on my way, then why...

148
00:18:24,205 --> 00:18:27,249
- You have to buzz.
- Okay. Okay. Sorry.

149
00:18:31,002 --> 00:18:32,212
Now what?

150
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:39,511
Yeah.

151
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:52,523
- Yes.
- Oof.

152
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:56,735
I lied.

153
00:18:58,028 --> 00:18:59,654
I actually don't work
for the cable company.

154
00:18:59,737 --> 00:19:03,157
- Oh, great.
- Sorry.

155
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:05,743
As long as you don't work
in the D.A.'s office.

156
00:19:05,827 --> 00:19:07,537
Um...

157
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,414
Or for the...

158
00:19:09,497 --> 00:19:12,792
Oh, go on with that shit.

159
00:19:18,922 --> 00:19:21,008
When were you
at the waterfront?

160
00:19:21,091 --> 00:19:22,342
What are you
looking at?

161
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,845
Your Instagram.

162
00:19:24,928 --> 00:19:26,722
You ate at The Pink Door?

163
00:19:27,222 --> 00:19:28,307
No.

164
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,017
You wrote here you did.

165
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,019
I just liked the picture.

166
00:19:32,102 --> 00:19:35,271
Why would you write,
"Oh, my God, so delicious,"

167
00:19:35,354 --> 00:19:37,106
if you've never
been there before?

168
00:19:45,906 --> 00:19:48,576
You know that spot
used to be Arturo's?

169
00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:51,286
- No.
- With the red awning.

170
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:54,080
It's just right across the
street from the old guitar store.

171
00:19:55,332 --> 00:19:56,750
Vaguely. Yeah.

172
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,294
- It's a Thai place now.
- Is it good?

173
00:19:59,377 --> 00:20:01,504
I don't know,
they don't do takeout.

174
00:20:02,047 --> 00:20:03,548
Sickos.

175
00:20:03,631 --> 00:20:06,343
The guy in the lobby said it's
the best Thai food he ever had.

176
00:20:06,426 --> 00:20:09,428
Why can't things just be good? Why do
things always have to be "the best."

177
00:20:11,805 --> 00:20:13,432
I thought I'd try it.

178
00:20:13,515 --> 00:20:14,892
"This is the best
Mobil QuickMart

179
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:18,228
on the entire West Coast
of the United States."

180
00:20:18,312 --> 00:20:20,564
I'm just throwing it
out there.

181
00:20:20,647 --> 00:20:23,776
Look, we could go right at
6:00, as soon as they open,

182
00:20:25,151 --> 00:20:26,486
before anybody's there.

183
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:29,739
It would just be me and you.

184
00:20:29,822 --> 00:20:31,949
The server
ain't even came in yet.

185
00:20:33,284 --> 00:20:35,536
We could yell our order
straight to the cook.

186
00:20:39,123 --> 00:20:40,625
Never mind.

187
00:20:55,514 --> 00:20:57,349
I'm sorry.

188
00:20:57,432 --> 00:20:59,433
You promised
you wouldn't do that.

189
00:20:59,517 --> 00:21:02,603
I know, but you were trying this
morning with the food truck.

190
00:21:05,189 --> 00:21:09,110
I brought that up,
that was my suggestion, on my terms.

191
00:21:09,193 --> 00:21:12,363
Okay, okay.

192
00:21:12,446 --> 00:21:14,281
Look, I don't know
how much longer I can...

193
00:21:14,365 --> 00:21:16,574
I didn't get through my streams.
I have work tonight.

194
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:22,997
Exhausting.

195
00:22:23,597 --> 00:22:25,723
- Kimi.
- <i>I'm here!</i>

196
00:22:26,932 --> 00:22:28,934
Open next stream
on desktop.

197
00:22:43,948 --> 00:22:45,366
<i>Stop it.</i>

198
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:10,390
<i>Stop it.</i>

199
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,708
<i>Stop it.</i>

200
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:30,841
<i>Stop it.</i>

201
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:29,021
<i>Stop it.</i>

202
00:25:55,879 --> 00:25:58,590
- <i>Stop it.</i>
- <i>Shut your mouth, bitch.</i>

203
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:48,277
Oh...

204
00:27:49,403 --> 00:27:50,236
Ah!

205
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:53,364
Fuck.

206
00:27:57,952 --> 00:28:00,789
<i>Can you turn a little
left, please? Toward the light?</i>

207
00:28:00,872 --> 00:28:01,831
Mmm-hmm.

208
00:28:01,915 --> 00:28:03,374
<i>Okay, using your pinky finger,</i>

209
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:06,252
<i>can you feel along the
outer ridge of the gum line?</i>

210
00:28:07,336 --> 00:28:09,087
Yeah.

211
00:28:09,171 --> 00:28:12,299
<i>Okay, now feel that same ridge, but on
the other side, for the right molar.</i>

212
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:14,468
Okay.

213
00:28:14,551 --> 00:28:16,136
<i>Do you notice any difference?</i>

214
00:28:17,971 --> 00:28:20,140
Yeah, the left one's swollen.

215
00:28:20,224 --> 00:28:22,059
<i>Soft or hard tissue?</i>

216
00:28:23,143 --> 00:28:24,268
Hard.

217
00:28:25,102 --> 00:28:26,813
<i>You need to come in.</i>

218
00:28:26,896 --> 00:28:30,483
<i>Angela, your gum is swollen
and inflamed with red streaks.</i>

219
00:28:30,566 --> 00:28:31,526
You may have an abscess.

220
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,528
Can't you just call in
an antibiotic?

221
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:36,531
<i>I could, but it'll come back.
We need to do a root canal.</i>

222
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:39,867
I take perfect care
of my teeth.

223
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:43,703
<i>You grind. You cracked it.
It happens.</i>

224
00:28:43,787 --> 00:28:48,041
I take perfect care of my teeth
so that I don't need to come in.

225
00:28:48,124 --> 00:28:52,420
<i>I understand. I thought things had
improved for you in this... in this area.</i>

226
00:28:52,504 --> 00:28:55,715
Yeah. Well, COVID was a
little bit of a setback. So...

227
00:28:56,633 --> 00:28:58,134
<i>I... I understand that.</i>

228
00:28:58,218 --> 00:28:59,969
<i>And I know
this is difficult for you.</i>

229
00:29:00,052 --> 00:29:01,178
You don't know.

230
00:29:02,721 --> 00:29:04,139
<i>No, I guess I don't know.</i>

231
00:29:04,223 --> 00:29:06,058
<i>What I do know
is that an abscessed tooth</i>

232
00:29:06,141 --> 00:29:09,144
<i>is a magic carpet for bacteria to enter
the bloodstream and go to your brain.</i>

233
00:29:09,228 --> 00:29:11,564
Please just call in the
prescription to the regular place.

234
00:29:11,647 --> 00:29:13,232
And maybe
some painkillers, okay?

235
00:29:13,315 --> 00:29:15,650
<i>I'm not prescribing opiates
for a toothache</i>

236
00:29:15,733 --> 00:29:17,235
<i>you're perfectly capable
of treating.</i>

237
00:29:17,318 --> 00:29:22,073
I am not capable of treating it
and you know it.

238
00:29:24,784 --> 00:29:27,370
<i>I can't come to you. I would
need too much equipment.</i>

239
00:29:27,453 --> 00:29:29,330
Please just call it in.

240
00:29:29,414 --> 00:29:31,291
<i>The antibiotic only.</i>

241
00:29:31,374 --> 00:29:32,500
<i>But you're making a mistake.</i>

242
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:34,293
Yeah, okay. Thanks.

243
00:30:28,052 --> 00:30:29,595
<i>Why would you
send me that stream?</i>

244
00:30:29,678 --> 00:30:32,389
<i>I have told everybody not
to send me things like that.</i>

245
00:30:32,473 --> 00:30:34,391
<i>And especially
a week before the IPO.</i>

246
00:30:34,475 --> 00:30:36,477
I thought it might
have been a crime.

247
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:38,437
<i>Delete it.</i>

248
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,314
Did you hear me?
I thought it might have been a crime.

249
00:30:40,397 --> 00:30:43,024
<i>Yeah, the devices
pick up things. Lots of things.</i>

250
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,360
<i>And our policy
is it's not our business.</i>

251
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:49,656
Aren't we legally obligated?
Because of the Amazon Arkansas thing?

252
00:30:49,739 --> 00:30:52,367
<i>Do you know how long that court case was?
That was two years.</i>

253
00:30:54,327 --> 00:30:57,038
<i>And that was a murder. Trust me,
Angela, we do not want our own Arkansas.</i>

254
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:59,081
I think this might
have been sexual assault.

255
00:30:59,164 --> 00:31:03,502
<i>Don't... No. Don't say that.
You don't know that. It was an argument.</i>

256
00:31:03,585 --> 00:31:05,295
I have a very strong feeling.

257
00:31:05,921 --> 00:31:07,089
<i>Based on what?</i>

258
00:31:08,256 --> 00:31:10,550
Based on my
very strong feeling.

259
00:31:11,468 --> 00:31:14,179
<i>Okay. Just skip this one.</i>

260
00:31:14,262 --> 00:31:17,223
I can't do that. I clear my list.
I always clear my list.

261
00:31:17,306 --> 00:31:20,559
<i>Yes, I know that, and it's one of the
things that I like best about you.</i>

262
00:31:20,643 --> 00:31:23,479
<i>So here's what you do.
You just mark this degraded audio</i>

263
00:31:23,562 --> 00:31:25,481
<i>and delete it, and then you'll be clear.</i>

264
00:31:25,564 --> 00:31:28,526
<i>Will you please,
please shut up?</i>

265
00:31:28,609 --> 00:31:30,319
<i>I am trying to work!</i>

266
00:31:31,445 --> 00:31:32,946
What if this woman
needs help?

267
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:35,323
<i>We have
no idea who she is.</i>

268
00:31:35,407 --> 00:31:36,783
I have the stream number.

269
00:31:36,866 --> 00:31:38,618
<i>Yeah, but those
are randomly assigned.</i>

270
00:31:38,702 --> 00:31:40,954
<i>She's totally anonymous,
that's the whole point.</i>

271
00:31:41,871 --> 00:31:43,748
Why did I only get a partial?

272
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:47,335
There was no wake word.
How did the Kimi unit turn on?

273
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:48,545
<i>I'm here!</i>

274
00:31:48,628 --> 00:31:50,045
Kimi, turn off.

275
00:31:51,422 --> 00:31:53,340
Okay, what about
the device number?

276
00:31:53,424 --> 00:31:55,592
Can we access
the user account from that?

277
00:31:55,676 --> 00:31:58,012
<i>No. I don't have access
to those accounts.</i>

278
00:31:58,637 --> 00:31:59,763
Who does?

279
00:32:01,724 --> 00:32:04,101
- <i>Mrs. Chowdhury might.</i>
- Who?

280
00:32:04,184 --> 00:32:07,145
<i>Natalie Chowdhury,
she's the head of Organic Interpolation.</i>

281
00:32:07,228 --> 00:32:10,356
<i>She's in Seattle,
in a, uh, tech hub someplace.</i>

282
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,108
Okay. What's her email?

283
00:32:12,191 --> 00:32:15,778
<i>Don't email, you infant.
Call her.</i>

284
00:32:16,696 --> 00:32:18,197
Okay, what's her number?

285
00:32:18,281 --> 00:32:21,159
<i>Listen, don't email
anybody about this.</i>

286
00:32:21,242 --> 00:32:23,494
<i>I'm telling you, you do not
want the aggravation.</i>

287
00:32:23,578 --> 00:32:24,786
<i>They hate
this kind of thing.</i>

288
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,246
What is her number?

289
00:32:26,329 --> 00:32:28,373
<i>I don't know. Look it up
in the company directory.</i>

290
00:32:28,457 --> 00:32:32,627
<i>And, hey, don't send me anything
like this ever again. Please.</i>

291
00:32:32,711 --> 00:32:36,631
<i>Hey, you guys, I swear to God!
You are driving me insane!</i>

292
00:32:36,715 --> 00:32:40,926
<i>I am going to take everything you
love and put it in a garbage bag!</i>

293
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:43,554
- <i>Organics.</i>
- Hi, may I sp...

294
00:32:43,637 --> 00:32:46,265
Is this the number
for Ms. Chowdhury?

295
00:32:46,348 --> 00:32:49,310
<i>Ms. Chowdhury's not in
just now. May I take a message?</i>

296
00:32:49,393 --> 00:32:53,272
Yes, my name is Angela Childs.
I'm a voice stream interpreter.

297
00:32:53,355 --> 00:32:57,109
And I believe I may have heard
a crime on one of the streams.

298
00:32:57,193 --> 00:33:02,280
<i>I see. Amygdala takes evidence of
wrongdoing very seriously, Ms. Childs.</i>

299
00:33:02,363 --> 00:33:05,992
<i>If you could please write a detailed
summary and email it to Ms. Chowdhury,</i>

300
00:33:06,076 --> 00:33:08,369
<i>she will return your call
by the end of day.</i>

301
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:15,209
Uh, I'd rather
just tell her about it.

302
00:33:15,292 --> 00:33:17,669
<i>Amygdala takes this
very seriously, Ms. Childs,</i>

303
00:33:17,753 --> 00:33:20,339
<i>and we do ask that you start
with a written report.</i>

304
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,221
- <i>Organics.</i>
- Hello, this is Angela Childs.

305
00:33:27,304 --> 00:33:30,557
I was just wondering
if Ms. Chowdhury was in yet?

306
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:34,310
<i>Ms. Chowdhury's not in just now.
Did you send the report?</i>

307
00:33:34,393 --> 00:33:38,106
No, not yet, but I will. Do you have
any sense of when she'll be back?

308
00:33:38,189 --> 00:33:40,149
Hello again, this is Angela Childs calling.
I was wondering...

309
00:33:40,233 --> 00:33:43,027
<i>Yes, Ms.
Childs, I recognized the number.</i>

310
00:33:43,111 --> 00:33:45,530
<i>I'm afraid
she's still not free.</i>

311
00:33:45,613 --> 00:33:50,117
<i>It might be easier if you just came in.
You're in Seattle, I see?</i>

312
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,785
Yes.

313
00:33:51,868 --> 00:33:54,746
<i>Fine, just come down to the
office in about an hour.</i>

314
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,998
Bring the recording, and if
she isn't available, I'll...

315
00:33:57,082 --> 00:33:58,375
I can't come there.

316
00:33:59,459 --> 00:34:01,002
<i>May I ask why not?</i>

317
00:34:02,295 --> 00:34:05,173
Yes, because
it's not convenient.

318
00:34:06,632 --> 00:34:10,010
But you can tell her
that I will be

319
00:34:10,094 --> 00:34:12,805
available all day. Okay?

320
00:34:12,888 --> 00:34:15,057
<i>Okay, Ms. Childs, I will do.</i>

321
00:34:16,475 --> 00:34:17,643
Thank you.

322
00:34:38,371 --> 00:34:39,831
<i>Hey.</i>

323
00:34:39,914 --> 00:34:42,207
Hey, Prosecutor,
what you doing?

324
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:44,168
<i>I can't really talk right now.</i>

325
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:45,961
<i>Make it fast. What's up?</i>

326
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:48,755
Okay, sorry. Um,
I just had a quick question.

327
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:52,759
Um, if I heard a crime
on one of the streams,

328
00:34:53,427 --> 00:34:54,511
who do I tell?

329
00:34:54,595 --> 00:34:56,054
<i>FBI.</i>

330
00:34:56,138 --> 00:34:59,807
<i>The Internet is interstate.
What'd you hear?</i>

331
00:34:59,891 --> 00:35:02,602
I'll, um,
I'll tell you later...

332
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:04,478
When you come over?

333
00:35:06,898 --> 00:35:10,276
Maybe around 8:00-ish?

334
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:13,571
<i>I don't know.</i>

335
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:17,407
<i>I'll text you.</i>

336
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:18,909
Okay.

337
00:35:44,683 --> 00:35:47,144
<i>Hey, Hotness!</i>

338
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,520
Seriously, Darius,
they will fire you for that.

339
00:35:49,604 --> 00:35:52,565
<i>I invite them to fuck off!</i>

340
00:35:52,649 --> 00:35:55,318
- Are you drunk?
- <i>Yes. What do you want?</i>

341
00:35:56,486 --> 00:35:59,197
What's a freq tab D 26,
26 request?

342
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,782
<i>Why?</i>

343
00:36:00,865 --> 00:36:02,575
It was on a stream yesterday.

344
00:36:03,243 --> 00:36:04,327
<i>Ah!</i>

345
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,453
<i>A freq tab means a Kimi unit's
been tabbed...</i>

346
00:36:06,536 --> 00:36:08,705
- <i>I'm here!</i>
- <i>Kimi, turn off!</i>

347
00:36:08,789 --> 00:36:11,917
<i>for frequent interpolation
and interpretation.</i>

348
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,462
<i>D 26, 26 means it's not
the algorithm picking it,</i>

349
00:36:15,545 --> 00:36:19,466
<i>it's the code of the person
requesting it. Why?</i>

350
00:36:19,549 --> 00:36:22,261
- How do I find out who requested it?
- <i>You can't.</i>

351
00:36:22,344 --> 00:36:23,719
- Can you?
- <i>Maybe.</i>

352
00:36:23,803 --> 00:36:26,889
<i>I don't know. I've never tried.
I'd need the device number.</i>

353
00:36:30,643 --> 00:36:34,397
Just sent it to you. But you can't access
the user data with the device number.

354
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,942
<i>Of course you can.
Who says you can't?</i>

355
00:36:38,025 --> 00:36:39,610
- Someone at corporate.
- <i>Well, they lied.</i>

356
00:36:39,694 --> 00:36:41,570
<i>If you have the device number
and the admin code,</i>

357
00:36:41,653 --> 00:36:43,613
<i>you can hear every recording
that Kimi's ever made...</i>

358
00:36:43,697 --> 00:36:45,073
- <i>I'm here!</i>
- <i>...if you want.</i>

359
00:36:45,156 --> 00:36:47,867
<i>Kimi, turn the fuck off!</i>

360
00:36:47,951 --> 00:36:50,203
Do you have an admin code?

361
00:36:50,287 --> 00:36:54,499
<i>Yes, but I'm not gonna give you mine.
You'd need a dummy code.</i>

362
00:36:54,582 --> 00:36:57,669
- Will you make me one?
- <i>Why the fuck would I do that?</i>

363
00:36:57,752 --> 00:37:00,004
<i>You know, you only ever call me
when you need a favor.</i>

364
00:37:00,087 --> 00:37:04,341
<i>And your Instagram is bullshit,
by the way. I data scraped.</i>

365
00:37:04,425 --> 00:37:09,054
<i>It's full of reposts and lies.
I don't even know who you are, really.</i>

366
00:37:10,931 --> 00:37:11,890
<i>Ah!</i>

367
00:37:11,974 --> 00:37:14,101
<i>Who makes
fake life online, huh?</i>

368
00:37:14,184 --> 00:37:17,520
Literally everyone. Can you make
me a dummy admin code, please?

369
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:19,397
<i>Why should I?</i>

370
00:37:21,107 --> 00:37:24,402
- Because I heard something bad.
- <i>You hear lots bad.</i>

371
00:37:24,485 --> 00:37:25,987
No, not like this.

372
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,156
And, trust me, I know bad.
I used to moderate for Facebook.

373
00:37:32,743 --> 00:37:34,369
Shit. I gotta go.
Send me the code?

374
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:38,290
<i>This is last favor, fake Hotness.
You're too weird, even for me.</i>

375
00:37:38,373 --> 00:37:39,249
Thanks. Bye.

376
00:37:41,043 --> 00:37:42,836
Hi.

377
00:37:42,919 --> 00:37:45,672
<i>Where are you? We had a session
starting 20 minutes ago.</i>

378
00:37:45,756 --> 00:37:48,717
I am... Something came up at work that I, uh...

379
00:37:51,635 --> 00:37:53,220
<i>Angela?</i>

380
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:56,140
Yeah. That I, uh, just got
a little wrapped up in.

381
00:37:56,223 --> 00:37:59,560
<i>"Wrapped up?" What do you mean, wrapped up?</i>

382
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:03,939
I just, um, couldn't stop
thinking about it.

383
00:38:04,023 --> 00:38:07,192
<i>Angela? What are you doing?
This is rude.</i>

384
00:38:08,193 --> 00:38:09,903
Yeah, sorry. I'm sorry.

385
00:38:09,986 --> 00:38:13,406
Uh, I was just looking at the... the thing.

386
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:15,450
Some new data
has come to light.

387
00:38:15,533 --> 00:38:19,829
<i>Okay. This is the sort of thing we've
wanted to leave behind, isn't it?</i>

388
00:38:19,913 --> 00:38:23,375
<i>Thinking about something
to the exclusion of all else,</i>

389
00:38:23,457 --> 00:38:25,334
<i>even when you've been
asked to stop?</i>

390
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:28,587
<i>Like the virus,
like Evergreen...</i>

391
00:38:28,671 --> 00:38:32,925
Wow! Wow, just leaping in
with both feet today, huh?

392
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:37,763
<i>What is this work thing?
Why pursue this?</i>

393
00:38:37,846 --> 00:38:39,890
I heard something and I...

394
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,725
I think a woman
might need help.

395
00:38:45,019 --> 00:38:46,521
<i>Maybe she does.</i>

396
00:38:46,604 --> 00:38:50,441
<i>Or maybe you've just replaced
your real stresses with this.</i>

397
00:38:51,776 --> 00:38:53,361
<i>Do you think
it's time to talk about it?</i>

398
00:38:53,444 --> 00:38:56,447
- About what?
- <i>What happened to you at Evergreen.</i>

399
00:38:56,531 --> 00:38:59,991
<i>How long you're going to let it
color the rest of your life.</i>

400
00:39:00,075 --> 00:39:02,202
Yeah.

401
00:39:03,078 --> 00:39:05,789
Yeah. I think you're right.

402
00:39:05,872 --> 00:39:10,961
<i>And at what point are you going to
say "Enough. My life starts now?"</i>

403
00:39:11,044 --> 00:39:14,797
Yep. Yep. You are...

404
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,174
You're 100% right, Dr. Burns.

405
00:39:17,258 --> 00:39:18,968
Thank you. Thank you.

406
00:39:19,051 --> 00:39:22,847
And I'm realizing the thing that I
really want to be able to do is, like...

407
00:40:30,452 --> 00:40:32,746
- <i>Kimi.</i>
- <i>I'm here!</i>

408
00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:34,164
<i>Call Brad mobile.</i>

409
00:40:36,124 --> 00:40:38,543
- <i>Kimi.</i>
- <i>I'm here!</i>

410
00:40:38,627 --> 00:40:41,545
<i>Play "Oxytocin"
by Billie Eilish.</i>

411
00:40:44,965 --> 00:40:47,343
- <i>Kimi.</i>
- <i>I'm here!</i>

412
00:40:47,426 --> 00:40:48,928
<i>Call Brad mobile.</i>

413
00:40:57,977 --> 00:40:59,395
- <i>Kimi.</i>
- <i>I'm here!</i>

414
00:40:59,479 --> 00:41:00,980
<i>Open recording.</i>

415
00:41:09,489 --> 00:41:12,408
<i>You have
to fucking stop this.</i>

416
00:41:12,492 --> 00:41:13,785
<i>You know
what you did.</i>

417
00:41:13,868 --> 00:41:15,744
<i>You don't know
what you're talking about.</i>

418
00:41:15,827 --> 00:41:17,579
<i>I don't know
what I'm talking about?</i>

419
00:41:17,663 --> 00:41:20,958
- <i>It wasn't like that.</i>
- <i>Admit what you did.</i>

420
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:23,168
<i>I thought
it was a fucking game.</i>

421
00:41:23,252 --> 00:41:25,254
<i>Bullshit!</i>

422
00:41:25,337 --> 00:41:26,755
<i>You raped me.</i>

423
00:41:26,838 --> 00:41:28,757
<i>You're insane. I...
I don't know what you want.</i>

424
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,468
<i>I want people
to know who you really are.</i>

425
00:41:31,552 --> 00:41:34,095
<i>I want them to know
you're a rapist!</i>

426
00:41:34,178 --> 00:41:36,556
<i>Stop it!
And stop calling my house.</i>

427
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:40,226
<i>No, Brad.
No. I won't be discarded.</i>

428
00:41:40,309 --> 00:41:41,435
<i>This is over.</i>

429
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:43,688
<i>Oh, no, it isn't.</i>

430
00:41:43,771 --> 00:41:46,816
<i>I know things, Brad.</i>

431
00:41:46,899 --> 00:41:48,776
<i>You should
stop talking right now.</i>

432
00:41:48,859 --> 00:41:51,611
<i>People need to know
about your shitty product.</i>

433
00:41:51,695 --> 00:41:56,283
<i>They should know anybody can
hack into it any time they want.</i>

434
00:41:56,366 --> 00:41:59,452
<i>Say goodbye
to your $100 million.</i>

435
00:41:59,536 --> 00:42:01,413
<i>You're sick.
Get some help.</i>

436
00:42:01,496 --> 00:42:05,000
- <i>Admit what you did!</i>
- <i>Don't you fucking touch me! You...</i>

437
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:06,917
<i>You ever come
to my house again, I'll...</i>

438
00:42:07,001 --> 00:42:08,961
What?
What are you gonna do?

439
00:42:09,044 --> 00:42:12,798
I'm not fucking around anymore!
Stop it! Stop it now.

440
00:42:12,881 --> 00:42:15,134
<i>No, Brad! No, Brad!</i>

441
00:42:15,217 --> 00:42:18,596
No, Brad! No, Brad!

442
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:20,139
No!

443
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:28,229
- Kimi.
- <i>I'm here!</i>

444
00:42:28,313 --> 00:42:29,314
Turn off.

445
00:42:55,589 --> 00:42:57,174
- <i>Kimi.</i>
- <i>I'm here!</i>

446
00:42:57,257 --> 00:42:58,758
<i>Open recording.</i>

447
00:43:05,598 --> 00:43:08,225
What... Oh, my... No!

448
00:43:09,685 --> 00:43:12,063
<i>Over there. Over there.</i>

449
00:43:12,146 --> 00:43:14,357
Lay her down.

450
00:43:16,941 --> 00:43:19,361
That's it.
Over there. On the ground.

451
00:43:22,447 --> 00:43:24,240
- Watch the spray.
- Yep.

452
00:43:27,535 --> 00:43:28,578
That's it.

453
00:44:43,648 --> 00:44:45,066
Hello?

454
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:47,819
<i>May I
speak to Ms. Childs, please?</i>

455
00:44:52,532 --> 00:44:54,367
This is she.

456
00:44:54,451 --> 00:44:57,287
<i>It's Natalie Chowdhury,
returning your call.</i>

457
00:45:01,415 --> 00:45:02,916
<i>Are you there?</i>

458
00:45:05,043 --> 00:45:08,255
Yes. Yes, I'm here.

459
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:11,633
<i>As I said, it's Natalie
Chowdhury, from Amygdala.</i>

460
00:45:11,717 --> 00:45:15,470
<i>You called me earlier
about, uh, a data stream?</i>

461
00:45:15,553 --> 00:45:17,889
- <i>Several times, I see.</i>
- Yes.

462
00:45:17,972 --> 00:45:21,517
Yes,
I've heard something.

463
00:45:21,601 --> 00:45:23,853
I've heard
something disturbing.

464
00:45:25,605 --> 00:45:28,649
<i>I see. Well, um...</i>

465
00:45:28,733 --> 00:45:32,778
<i>I am sorry to say that this
does come up from time to time.</i>

466
00:45:32,861 --> 00:45:35,530
<i>And it is not something
I take lightly.</i>

467
00:45:35,614 --> 00:45:38,617
<i>You've called exactly the right person.</i>

468
00:45:39,743 --> 00:45:42,496
<i>I... I'll tell you
what let's do.</i>

469
00:45:42,579 --> 00:45:46,833
<i>Let's definitely call the FBI
as soon as possible.</i>

470
00:45:46,917 --> 00:45:49,835
<i>I'm clearing my schedule
for the rest of the day.</i>

471
00:45:49,919 --> 00:45:51,504
<i>Close your files,
come to my office,</i>

472
00:45:51,587 --> 00:45:54,548
<i>and we'll listen
to the recordings together.</i>

473
00:45:54,632 --> 00:45:56,217
<i>We can be joined
by a third party</i>

474
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:59,178
<i>and you can select
from anyone on my staff.</i>

475
00:45:59,261 --> 00:46:02,056
<i>Then we'll notify
the authorities officially.</i>

476
00:46:02,139 --> 00:46:03,599
<i>Together.</i>

477
00:46:03,682 --> 00:46:07,477
<i>When they come,
we'll play everything for them here.</i>

478
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,145
<i>Does that sound good?</i>

479
00:46:10,563 --> 00:46:12,065
I'm leaving now.

480
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,462
Hey. Hey! 4F? Angela?

481
00:49:13,361 --> 00:49:15,570
Yeah, that's lateral thinking.

482
00:49:19,408 --> 00:49:21,284
No, that's Caracas.

483
00:49:23,328 --> 00:49:24,579
Mmm-hmm.

484
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:26,707
Blocked.

485
00:49:27,624 --> 00:49:28,917
Mmm-hmm.

486
00:49:29,001 --> 00:49:30,377
September.

487
00:49:35,214 --> 00:49:37,508
Everybody keep going.
I'll jump back on in five.

488
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,767
This was not our agreement.

489
00:49:46,851 --> 00:49:48,227
<i>No choice.</i>

490
00:49:48,935 --> 00:49:50,353
Why not?

491
00:49:50,437 --> 00:49:52,647
<i>Your friend...</i>

492
00:49:52,731 --> 00:49:54,274
<i>Did you give her a Kimi?</i>

493
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:56,651
Holy shit.

494
00:50:00,196 --> 00:50:02,949
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

495
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:08,120
She got unpredictable. Threatening.
I was just keeping an eye on things.

496
00:50:09,371 --> 00:50:11,331
<i>Well, so was she.</i>

497
00:50:11,415 --> 00:50:13,083
I don't understand how...

498
00:50:13,167 --> 00:50:15,252
<i>Tech worker got an algo prompt.</i>

499
00:50:15,335 --> 00:50:17,379
<i>She's on her way
to see Chowdhury.</i>

500
00:50:20,591 --> 00:50:21,675
What now?

501
00:50:23,676 --> 00:50:26,179
<i>How much more cash
can you get?</i>

502
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:08,552
<i>Remove
eyeglasses and lean into scanner.</i>

503
00:51:09,261 --> 00:51:11,263
Oh, I never, um...

504
00:51:11,347 --> 00:51:15,642
<i>Remove
eye glasses and lean into scanner.</i>

505
00:51:15,725 --> 00:51:17,018
Hello?

506
00:51:17,894 --> 00:51:19,187
Hello?

507
00:51:30,198 --> 00:51:33,534
<i>Please
use this card to access floor three.</i>

508
00:52:13,905 --> 00:52:15,991
Excuse me.
Ms. Chowdhury's office?

509
00:52:16,074 --> 00:52:18,827
- Um, at the end of the hall to the left.
- Thanks.

510
00:52:35,676 --> 00:52:39,180
Hi. I'm here
to see Ms. Chowdhury.

511
00:52:39,263 --> 00:52:41,890
Ms. Childs.
Yes, she's expecting you.

512
00:52:41,973 --> 00:52:44,058
Can I get you anything?
Are you all right?

513
00:52:44,142 --> 00:52:46,686
- Everything's good. Ms. Childs.
- Hi.

514
00:52:46,769 --> 00:52:49,063
- Hey, come on in.
- I'm fine.

515
00:52:51,482 --> 00:52:53,109
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

516
00:52:55,278 --> 00:52:58,697
Wow,
that is one hell of a story.

517
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:00,157
I just...

518
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,534
- Oh!
- Yeah, I thought so too.

519
00:53:02,618 --> 00:53:03,869
Oh!

520
00:53:05,037 --> 00:53:06,788
I'm with you, you know.

521
00:53:08,957 --> 00:53:10,709
- Okay.
- Okay.

522
00:53:11,877 --> 00:53:14,045
Can I hear the streams, then?

523
00:53:19,175 --> 00:53:20,426
Oh...

524
00:53:21,844 --> 00:53:23,095
Right now?

525
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:25,681
Well, yes.

526
00:53:27,975 --> 00:53:29,769
Oh. I...

527
00:53:31,186 --> 00:53:33,438
I, um...

528
00:53:33,521 --> 00:53:36,942
Sorry, I thought... I thought that
you said we would do it in the...

529
00:53:37,025 --> 00:53:39,236
In the presence of the FBI?

530
00:53:39,319 --> 00:53:42,030
That's not exactly
what I said,

531
00:53:42,113 --> 00:53:45,283
but I have to know
what we're dealing with.

532
00:53:45,367 --> 00:53:49,119
We're dealing with what sounds
like a premeditated murder.

533
00:53:49,203 --> 00:53:50,496
How do I know that?

534
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:52,915
Because I just told you.

535
00:53:54,541 --> 00:53:55,626
Twice now.

536
00:53:58,712 --> 00:54:00,839
- Okay, Angela.
- Yeah?

537
00:54:00,923 --> 00:54:04,468
How about you give me the device and
number, and I can pull the data myself?

538
00:54:04,551 --> 00:54:09,555
Can we please
just call the FBI first?

539
00:54:12,058 --> 00:54:14,727
- Angela.
- Yeah?

540
00:54:17,897 --> 00:54:22,360
I understand that you have taken
some mental health leave in the past.

541
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:29,241
W...
why is that in my file?

542
00:54:29,324 --> 00:54:32,661
Well, it's just to say
that I understand that...

543
00:54:32,744 --> 00:54:33,787
You understand what?

544
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:35,956
Well, not the specifics
of your case.

545
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:38,375
- I mean, I would never...
- I was assaulted. I...

546
00:54:40,418 --> 00:54:42,169
I was assaulted...

547
00:54:43,254 --> 00:54:44,463
And...

548
00:54:46,173 --> 00:54:48,509
and the police put me
on trial instead of him.

549
00:54:50,094 --> 00:54:53,681
Wow. That's awful.

550
00:54:55,891 --> 00:54:58,518
And under
those circumstances,

551
00:54:58,601 --> 00:55:01,187
I certainly understand
your reluctance.

552
00:55:03,857 --> 00:55:06,026
Are your parents
with us, Angela?

553
00:55:11,114 --> 00:55:12,741
My mother is.

554
00:55:14,033 --> 00:55:16,410
My father died
not long before the incident.

555
00:55:18,454 --> 00:55:19,455
I cannot imagine how that...

556
00:55:19,538 --> 00:55:21,749
I never gave you guys
a retinal scan.

557
00:55:22,875 --> 00:55:24,126
Sorry?

558
00:55:24,209 --> 00:55:25,753
Downstairs. There was
a retinal scanner at the door

559
00:55:25,836 --> 00:55:27,921
and it let me in,
but I never sat for a scan.

560
00:55:28,005 --> 00:55:31,090
Well, we take them off the
video conferences. It's faster.

561
00:55:31,174 --> 00:55:33,426
- But I didn't give permission.
- Sure you did.

562
00:55:33,509 --> 00:55:36,637
It's in the terms and conditions
of the conference software.

563
00:55:36,721 --> 00:55:38,306
Nobody reads those.

564
00:55:40,725 --> 00:55:41,893
Angela...

565
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:45,271
What are we doing here?

566
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:50,734
We're waiting for you
to call the FBI?

567
00:55:53,862 --> 00:55:56,406
You're right.

568
00:55:56,490 --> 00:56:01,578
You're right.
It'll take me two minutes. I...

569
00:56:01,661 --> 00:56:03,622
Okay, I have to get
Mr. Cole on the line.

570
00:56:03,705 --> 00:56:06,999
Um...
Make yourself comfortable.

571
00:56:09,085 --> 00:56:10,795
And, Angela...

572
00:56:13,005 --> 00:56:16,175
You're a very strong,
brave woman.

573
00:56:18,511 --> 00:56:20,930
No one's ever accused me
of that before.

574
00:56:21,555 --> 00:56:23,306
Well, it's true.

575
00:56:24,182 --> 00:56:25,517
You hang tight.

576
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:30,313
Hey, I am gonna get Cole
on the line...

577
00:56:31,564 --> 00:56:34,317
If he calls me
before I find him, just...

578
00:56:57,672 --> 00:57:00,967
Excuse me. Do you have
a bathroom I can use?

579
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:03,594
It's in the hallway.
Past the elevators.

580
00:57:14,521 --> 00:57:16,606
Phew.

581
00:57:37,751 --> 00:57:39,044
Shit.

582
01:00:57,731 --> 01:00:58,940
That way.

583
01:01:45,276 --> 01:01:46,695
<i>Hey, you've reached Terry Hughes.</i>

584
01:01:46,778 --> 01:01:49,113
<i>Sorry, I can't come
to the phone right now.</i>

585
01:01:58,789 --> 01:02:00,416
<i>This is Dr. Sarah Burns.</i>

586
01:02:00,499 --> 01:02:03,335
<i>I'm away from the phone
or in a session right now.</i>

587
01:03:01,973 --> 01:03:03,641
That envelope looks thin.

588
01:03:05,101 --> 01:03:07,187
It's a Coinbase login.

589
01:03:08,271 --> 01:03:09,564
Better be enough.

590
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,025
It's everything I have left.

591
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:16,069
We are contained and clean
at a corporate level.

592
01:03:16,153 --> 01:03:17,821
But the tech worker's
in the open.

593
01:03:20,073 --> 01:03:22,326
You said you had her.

594
01:03:22,409 --> 01:03:24,745
They did.
But now they don't.

595
01:03:24,828 --> 01:03:26,288
What the fuck, Rivas?

596
01:03:26,371 --> 01:03:27,790
I can handle it.

597
01:03:28,707 --> 01:03:30,583
I'll use Yuri.

598
01:03:30,666 --> 01:03:32,710
But Yuri's expensive. So...

599
01:03:34,754 --> 01:03:36,923
This is...
This is happening too fast.

600
01:03:37,006 --> 01:03:38,424
I know, right?

601
01:03:38,508 --> 01:03:40,968
Crazy times.
The world these days.

602
01:03:41,052 --> 01:03:44,096
I mean, it bums me out,
to be honest.

603
01:03:47,891 --> 01:03:50,852
Relax. In a week
you'll be rich.

604
01:03:50,936 --> 01:03:52,312
Don't ever contact me again.

605
01:04:04,449 --> 01:04:06,534
Forget how to use
a rerouter?

606
01:04:06,617 --> 01:04:09,912
<i>I need a moving
packet location in real-time.</i>

607
01:04:09,995 --> 01:04:12,873
- Just use Spyic.
- <i>Didn't work.</i>

608
01:04:12,957 --> 01:04:16,126
- This an amateur?
- <i>She works in tech.</i>

609
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:17,378
So she has TrakBlok.

610
01:04:17,461 --> 01:04:19,171
<i>Why do you think
I called you?</i>

611
01:04:20,214 --> 01:04:21,881
I like her.

612
01:04:21,965 --> 01:04:24,050
$50,000 if I'm always live.

613
01:04:24,133 --> 01:04:25,677
<i>That's usurious.</i>

614
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,971
No, it is not.
I'm not charging interest.

615
01:04:28,054 --> 01:04:30,014
It's excessive,
is what you mean.

616
01:04:30,682 --> 01:04:32,058
<i>Fine. Fifty.</i>

617
01:04:35,478 --> 01:04:36,688
Number?

618
01:04:36,771 --> 01:04:41,316
<i>U.S. 206-134-0970.</i>

619
01:04:47,114 --> 01:04:48,448
Don't go anywhere.

620
01:05:31,989 --> 01:05:33,282
You still there?

621
01:05:33,365 --> 01:05:35,200
<i>Where the fuck else
would I be, Yuri?</i>

622
01:05:35,284 --> 01:05:39,163
She's moving south on Fifth,
towards Union.

623
01:05:40,372 --> 01:05:42,416
You better hurry.
She's walking fast.

624
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:00,433
What the hell?

625
01:06:04,228 --> 01:06:05,437
Oh, fuck me.

626
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:25,706
No, no, no, fuck you.

627
01:06:29,585 --> 01:06:32,672
Stop the sweep!
Stop the sweep!

628
01:07:09,415 --> 01:07:12,001
- Charlie! Charlie!
- Go! Go! Go!

629
01:07:12,084 --> 01:07:14,377
- No perimeter!
- Go!

630
01:07:28,641 --> 01:07:31,560
Help! Help!

631
01:07:44,781 --> 01:07:48,492
Homes, not jails!
Homes, not jails!

632
01:07:50,536 --> 01:07:53,581
<i>God damn it,
she's gone. Fucking gone.</i>

633
01:07:53,664 --> 01:07:55,041
Relax.

634
01:08:02,757 --> 01:08:05,717
<i>Yuri? You still there?
Where the fuck is she, Yuri?</i>

635
01:08:06,634 --> 01:08:08,803
Question is not where she is.

636
01:08:10,013 --> 01:08:12,098
It's where she's going.

637
01:08:12,182 --> 01:08:15,769
<i>I don't know. I couldn't see. Maybe she
went north. It's a fucking mob of people.</i>

638
01:08:15,852 --> 01:08:18,188
<i>Fucking assholes, man.
They've got nothing better to do.</i>

639
01:08:18,271 --> 01:08:20,273
<i>What the fuck
is wrong with people?</i>

640
01:08:20,356 --> 01:08:22,816
<i>Everybody in everybody
else's business.</i>

641
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,318
Que molestia.

642
01:08:54,389 --> 01:08:58,100
Are we going to go for at
least martinis? Who's buying this time?

643
01:09:02,729 --> 01:09:04,147
- No, you.
- Oh, why?

644
01:09:04,231 --> 01:09:05,982
You got the bonus.

645
01:09:06,066 --> 01:09:08,652
You got the bonus.
From, uh... from work.

646
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:57,948
There you are!

647
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:02,369
Ow!

648
01:10:02,452 --> 01:10:05,204
I told you
to wait for us.

649
01:10:11,294 --> 01:10:14,422
- Oh! Don't fall.
- Don't worry, I got you!

650
01:10:14,505 --> 01:10:15,882
- What...
- Shut up.

651
01:10:28,268 --> 01:10:29,644
She's still out.

652
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:32,564
Where else
can we do it?

653
01:10:32,647 --> 01:10:34,608
What? Like, in public?

654
01:10:34,691 --> 01:10:36,359
Sure.

655
01:10:36,443 --> 01:10:39,195
She never goes out,
now they're gonna find her on the street?

656
01:10:39,278 --> 01:10:41,572
Mugging. Bleeds out.
Happens all the time.

657
01:10:41,655 --> 01:10:43,407
He said at home.

658
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:45,201
What? A break-in?

659
01:10:45,284 --> 01:10:48,746
- Why not?
- I just don't like it.

660
01:10:48,829 --> 01:10:50,664
You don't have to.

661
01:10:57,003 --> 01:10:58,421
What did she do?

662
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:01,007
- Don't start.
- What, you never wonder?

663
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,051
- Please.
- Yeah...

664
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:06,221
This is it. Pull over.

665
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,564
Got her keys?

666
01:11:19,483 --> 01:11:20,525
Set?

667
01:11:22,527 --> 01:11:23,862
Wait for these two.

668
01:11:43,339 --> 01:11:44,924
Come on.

669
01:11:48,051 --> 01:11:49,344
Get her arm.

670
01:11:49,427 --> 01:11:50,637
You got her?

671
01:11:52,889 --> 01:11:54,099
Fuck.

672
01:12:01,398 --> 01:12:03,024
- You got her?
- I got her. Hurry up.

673
01:12:03,108 --> 01:12:04,984
Jesus, it's like
a fucking janitor's keys.

674
01:12:05,067 --> 01:12:06,569
Come on. It'll be great.

675
01:12:06,652 --> 01:12:09,071
- Angela!
- Incoming.

676
01:12:09,154 --> 01:12:13,158
Angela! Hey!
How's it going?

677
01:12:13,242 --> 01:12:17,162
Oh! You don't look
so good, girl.

678
01:12:17,246 --> 01:12:19,123
What's she been doing,
you guys?

679
01:12:19,206 --> 01:12:21,000
She had a little relapse.
But we got her.

680
01:12:21,083 --> 01:12:23,376
- Oh, yeah? That's it, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah.

681
01:12:23,459 --> 01:12:25,336
- Yeah, is that right? Good.
- Yeah, yeah. He's got her.

682
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:27,338
- Dude, what's going on?
- Help.

683
01:12:29,882 --> 01:12:31,467
Run! Run!

684
01:13:37,863 --> 01:13:40,491
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

685
01:13:40,574 --> 01:13:43,369
Not a sound.

686
01:14:02,095 --> 01:14:04,304
The couch.

687
01:14:23,197 --> 01:14:24,949
Here.

688
01:14:25,032 --> 01:14:26,742
Hold that there tight, okay?

689
01:14:27,743 --> 01:14:28,953
Thank you.

690
01:14:31,372 --> 01:14:33,791
I've seen you.

691
01:14:35,876 --> 01:14:39,295
Yeah. Yeah, I... I...

692
01:14:39,379 --> 01:14:41,089
I live over there.

693
01:14:43,967 --> 01:14:45,510
How did you know my name?

694
01:14:47,303 --> 01:14:48,972
It's, um...

695
01:14:49,055 --> 01:14:51,850
You know. It's... it's on your...
it's on your buzzer.

696
01:14:51,933 --> 01:14:53,351
Not my first name.

697
01:14:56,437 --> 01:15:00,232
I searched
your address records.

698
01:15:01,483 --> 01:15:03,193
It wasn't hard.

699
01:15:05,863 --> 01:15:07,448
You're like me.

700
01:15:08,323 --> 01:15:09,950
You never go out.

701
01:15:11,076 --> 01:15:13,244
That's how I knew
that you were in trouble.

702
01:15:16,622 --> 01:15:17,748
Serves me right.

703
01:15:28,134 --> 01:15:29,677
Is this the only copy?

704
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:32,262
- Well, I...
- No.

705
01:15:36,850 --> 01:15:38,685
Okay.

706
01:15:46,901 --> 01:15:51,113
The files on there
were dumped from somewhere.

707
01:15:52,448 --> 01:15:54,533
Where did you get them from?

708
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:58,370
Doesn't matter.

709
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:02,333
I emailed it to everyone
I know this morning.

710
01:16:02,416 --> 01:16:05,752
You sent it to exactly no one.
I went through your email.

711
01:16:07,212 --> 01:16:08,755
Where did you get them from?

712
01:16:09,631 --> 01:16:11,257
Who is it on the recording?

713
01:16:12,091 --> 01:16:13,426
Does it matter?

714
01:16:14,969 --> 01:16:17,388
Where did you copy that from?

715
01:16:21,975 --> 01:16:24,520
Toothache? Ooh.

716
01:16:36,031 --> 01:16:37,866
Where did you get it from?

717
01:16:49,919 --> 01:16:51,504
No. No.

718
01:16:51,587 --> 01:16:53,798
No.

719
01:16:54,674 --> 01:16:55,757
No.

720
01:17:02,931 --> 01:17:04,474
No, no, no, stop.

721
01:17:04,558 --> 01:17:06,768
Why would you? Don't.

722
01:17:09,271 --> 01:17:11,523
Get your fucking hands
away from there.

723
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:19,071
Laptop.

724
01:17:22,241 --> 01:17:23,617
Do you hear her? What?

725
01:17:23,701 --> 01:17:26,036
What? Say what now?

726
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:27,538
Laptop.

727
01:17:28,163 --> 01:17:29,164
Huh.

728
01:17:29,789 --> 01:17:30,748
Watch them.

729
01:17:42,093 --> 01:17:43,970
You'll need
the password.

730
01:17:44,053 --> 01:17:45,680
Oh, thank you.
We have all that.

731
01:17:51,893 --> 01:17:53,103
Thank you.

732
01:17:56,023 --> 01:17:57,858
- That's it?
- Yeah.

733
01:17:59,735 --> 01:18:01,236
Check her downloads.

734
01:18:02,237 --> 01:18:04,238
- Got it.
- Okay.

735
01:18:14,165 --> 01:18:15,666
Leave it.
Leave it. Leave it.

736
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:18,753
- Kimi!
- <i>I'm here!</i>

737
01:18:18,836 --> 01:18:20,254
Answer FaceTime on laptop.

738
01:18:23,256 --> 01:18:25,926
<i>Angela? What the...</i>

739
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:28,803
Kimi! Bedtime lights!

740
01:18:32,474 --> 01:18:34,184
Kimi! Play "Sabotage"!

741
01:18:38,646 --> 01:18:39,938
Kimi! Max volume!

742
01:21:28,723 --> 01:21:31,391
Forget about her.
I got the drive. Let's just go.

743
01:21:40,609 --> 01:21:41,527
What the...

744
01:21:44,029 --> 01:21:45,113
Ah.

745
01:21:52,078 --> 01:21:54,038
What the fuck's going on?

746
01:21:54,121 --> 01:21:56,624
I just got stabbed, asshole!

747
01:22:19,271 --> 01:22:20,605
Ah...

748
01:22:53,678 --> 01:22:55,721
- Kimi.
- <i>I'm here!</i>

749
01:22:58,181 --> 01:22:59,975
Turn the lights on, please.

750
01:23:14,822 --> 01:23:18,326
Hmm. Ooh.

751
01:23:18,409 --> 01:23:20,494
- Can you hold that there tight?
- Mmm.

752
01:23:23,039 --> 01:23:24,248
Coming!

753
01:23:32,172 --> 01:23:34,216
Hey, what's your name?

754
01:23:34,299 --> 01:23:36,468
I'm Kevin.

755
01:23:39,137 --> 01:23:40,388
Thanks, Kevin.

756
01:23:41,765 --> 01:23:43,141
Any...

757
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:45,101
Any time.

758
01:23:50,481 --> 01:23:52,233
- Kimi.
- <i>I'm here!</i>

759
01:23:53,025 --> 01:23:54,485
Call 9-1-1.

760
01:24:00,908 --> 01:24:03,534
I know. Sorry,
but somebody was coming up...

761
01:24:05,078 --> 01:24:07,038
<i>9-1-1, what's your emergency?</i>

762
01:24:07,121 --> 01:24:08,706
My name is Angela Childs.

763
01:24:08,790 --> 01:24:13,419
I'd like to report a break-in at
1-8-5-5 Stacy Street, apartment 4F.

764
01:24:13,503 --> 01:24:16,798
There's a person here who's been
stabbed and needs medical attention,

765
01:24:16,881 --> 01:24:18,800
and there's also, um...

766
01:24:20,759 --> 01:24:22,052
Three dead bodies.

767
01:24:22,135 --> 01:24:23,136
Hi.

768
01:24:23,637 --> 01:24:25,347
Hey...

769
01:26:15,368 --> 01:26:16,327
<i>I'm here!</i>
