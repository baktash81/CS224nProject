1
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,900
You know, after last year's corporate,
my wife was always encouraging me.

2
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,200
You know, she said: you did fine,
you did fine in the corporate.

3
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,300
I was a bit nervous. This
little guy... hello. Sorry.

4
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,800
That's nice, eh? Nice background
with the people there...

5
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,200
We are here at the... must I look..?
- Just look straight at the lens.

6
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,100
We are here at the... MNU head office,

7
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,400
Department of Alien Affairs.
My name is Wikus Van De Merwe.

8
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,800
And behind me you can see
the Alien Affairs' workers.

9
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,900
And what we do here at
this department is...

10
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,700
we try to engage with the Prawn

11
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,200
on behalf of MNU and
on behalf of humans.

12
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,200
To everyone's surprise, the
ship didn't come to a stop

13
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,200
over Manhattan or Washington or Chicago,

14
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,200
but instead it costed to a halt
directly over the city of Johannesburg.

15
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,200
The doors didn't open for 3 months. It
just hovered there. Nobody could get in.

16
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,900
And they eventually decided,
after much deliberation,

17
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:53,900
that the best thing to do would
be to physically cut their way in.

18
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,500
We were on the verge of first contact.

19
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,200
The whole world was watching.

20
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,600
Expecting, I don't know...

21
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,600
...music from heaven and
bright shining lights.

22
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,400
Oh my God!

23
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,400
The creatures were
extremely malnourished,

24
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,900
they were very unhealthy,
they seemed to be aimless.

25
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,900
There was a lot of international
pressure on us at the time.

26
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,400
The entire world was
looking at Johannesburg,

27
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,600
so we had to do the right thing.

28
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,700
The government then established
an aid group that started to

29
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,600
ferry the aliens to a temporary
camp set up just beneath the ship.

30
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,000
We didn't have a plan.
There was a million of them.

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,100
So, what was a temporary
holding zone soon became fenced,

32
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,500
became militarized. And before
we knew it, it was a slum.

33
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,800
But the truth is, nobody
really knew what this place was.

34
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,000
There's a lot of secrets in District 9.

35
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,100
At first, a lot of
attention was given to...

36
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,700
giving the aliens a proper
status and protection.

37
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,500
They're spending so much
money to keep them here.

38
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,600
When they could be spending
it on other things, but...

39
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,000
...at least they're keeping
them separate from us.

40
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,800
l want to be realistic with everyone.
The aliens will not be able to go home.

41
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,800
The aliens are here to stay.

42
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,100
There were literally
thousands of different theories

43
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,200
as to why the ship seemed inoperable,
and what was speculated was that

44
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,200
the command module had detached
itself from the main ship,

45
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,800
and then somehow
mysteriously became lost.

46
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,000
Did it fall by itself or was
it programmed? I don't know.

47
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,000
Examination of the old video footage

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,600
shows very clearly that a
piece falls from the ship.

49
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,400
We look for it. We look everywhere.

50
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,000
This piece that's falling
caused us bloody problems.

51
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,400
More energy weapon caches found.

52
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,200
The Special task force
conducted raids in District 9.

53
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,600
Where there's a weapon, there's
crime. Tensions rose, and rose.

54
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,300
People became more and more fed up,
and eventually the rioting started.

55
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,900
Residents in Tembisa rioted
for the third consecutive night

56
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:38,900
in an attempt to remove all
the aliens from their township.

57
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,800
I think they must fix
that ship and they must go.

58
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,800
A virus, a selective virus.
Release it near the aliens.

59
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,700
They must just go. I
don't know where, just go.

60
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,100
If they was from another
country we might understand.

61
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,200
But they are not even from this planet.

62
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,800
The government have
enforced a nationwide curfew.

63
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,000
The aliens, prawns,
they take my wife away.

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,600
The derogatory term Prawn is used for
the alien, and obviously it implies

65
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,600
something that is a bottom feeder,
that scavenges the leftovers.

66
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,900
I mean, you can't say
they don't look like that.

67
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,200
That's what they look like,
right? They look like prawns.

68
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,700
The aliens made off with an undisclosed
amount of cash. One bystander was hurt.

69
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,000
What for an alien might be
seen as something recreational,

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,100
setting fire to a
truck, derailing a train,

71
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,600
is for us obviously an
extremely destructive act.

72
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,000
They can take the sneakers
you are wearing off you.

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,400
They take whatever you have on
you. Your cell phone or anything.

74
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,100
After that they kill you.

75
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,900
And now, after 20 years, public
pressure had forced the government

76
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,000
to shift the aliens out of Johannesburg.

77
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,600
They had had enough and they
wanted District 9 to be moved,

78
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,000
and more intensively
policed and controlled.

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,700
So, to enforce this mass eviction,
the government turned to MNU.

80
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,100
Welcome all and thank you for coming.

81
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,000
Please listen very
closely to this briefing.

82
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:06,300
Today we start a very complex
and delicate operation.

83
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,400
This is the largest operation
that MNU has ever undertaken,

84
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,600
and we believe that it is going
to be undertaken successfully.

85
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,900
It is to move 1.8 million prawns

86
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,500
from their present home in District
9 to a safer and better location

87
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,400
200 kilometers outside
of Johannesburg City.

88
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,200
We built a nice new facility
where the prawn can go,

89
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,200
he can be comfortable,
he can stay there...

90
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,000
The people of Johannesburg and
of South Africa are going to live

91
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,500
happily and safely, knowing
that that prawn is very far away.

92
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,400
UIO protocol dictates
that we give the aliens

93
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,100
24 hours notice of our right to evict.

94
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:53,600
Today, you will serve these notices
getting the aliens to sign I-27 form.

95
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,400
The legality that MNU is using to
evict the aliens is simply a whitewash.

96
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,600
I'm going to appoint a field
officer to take direct command.

97
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,600
Wikus Van De Merwe.

98
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,200
Everybody always said that
Wikus was not a very smart boy,

99
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:15,000
but he was a wonderful son.
That was my Wikus, just...

100
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,800
Feels like life on the big
stage. Thank you Piet... Mr Smith.

101
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,300
l had to put aside the fact that
my daughter was married to Wikus.

102
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,300
That didn't affect my
decision to promote him.

103
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,200
It's almost as big as my wedding
day. You know... not as big.

104
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,500
Wikus was always making me things.

105
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,500
He said that way they
just mean so much more.

106
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,500
He left this paper-mache
bowl on the sofa one day

107
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,000
and I didn't see it and I sat
down, and I... kinda squashed it.

108
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,800
They took all his stuff away
for the investigation, and...

109
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,400
I made them bring it all back.

110
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,000
Hey, congratulations,
man! -Thanks, man.

111
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,400
Okay, you're gonna go to P7.
- Wikus! -How is it going, man?

112
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,100
Here's the shake. P9 for you. -Thanks.

113
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,900
I'm not saying what he
did was right, but...

114
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,800
he took the choices
that were given to him.

115
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,700
This is Trent. Fundiswa, Trent. -Hi.

116
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,600
Fundiswa is the guy that
I've selected to replace me.

117
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,600
If he can make it
today, eh? -I'll make it.

118
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,700
I just want everyone
watching this right now

119
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,200
to learn from what has
happened. -You would think...

120
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,500
things like this would happen
to somebody else, not to me.

121
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,200
How is it going, man? Long time,
mate. Have you got my stuff?

122
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,800
Hey, boss! -How is it
going? -I'm all right, boss.

123
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,500
Good, good, this is Fundiswa.
He is training with us today.

124
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,300
I think I was disgusted
with the way he worked.

125
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,200
There was always just a hint
of something not quite kosher

126
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,000
with mr Van De Merwe.
- Nobody saw it coming at all.

127
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,800
None of us had any idea
of what he was doing.

128
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,300
l think it is a great
thing to see that...

129
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,500
it's not the military
guys in charge this time.

130
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,700
Not to say that Koobus and
his cowboys are not wanted.

131
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,900
You guys are always wanted.

132
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,700
You see now, these are the cowboys.

133
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,200
They shoot first, and then
they answer the questions.

134
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,200
Sorry, is this above the
allocated amount of ammunition?

135
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,400
Because I see your
pouches are full but...

136
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,800
I think maybe you should
speak to the colonel.

137
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,500
F.A.G. over here says that
we got too much ammunition.

138
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,000
No, all I'm saying,
Koobus, is that, you know...

139
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,000
you should find ways of making
you guys more efficient...

140
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,200
Listen to me, you fuck!

141
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,600
Get him outta my face.

142
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,800
There are rules, we're all
living by rules in this world.

143
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,100
Well, l don't think he can
be forgiven for what he did,

144
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,100
cause it's like a betrayal.
- I've gotta get going, Les.

145
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:43,100
I think we're gonna have to cut this
interview, cause we're gonna go...

146
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,400
12 KILOMETERS FROM DISTRICT 9

147
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,500
Take your magazines,
people. Come on, lets go.

148
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,700
The Prawn doesn't really understand
the concept of ownership of property.

149
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,200
So, we have to come there and
say: listen, this is our land.

150
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,800
Please, will you go?

151
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,200
It's difficult to put
the vest on by yourself.

152
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,300
Thomas, can you help
me? -All right, boss.

153
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,900
They told me I was gonna get
the vest inside the Casper.

154
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,700
Thomas, just look on the
side if there's a vest there?

155
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,900
I'm just concerned about my family.
- Don't worry about the vest, it'll be fine.

156
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,000
Rights groups have demanded
that mercenaries should comply

157
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,400
with all UYO regulations in District 9.

158
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,600
We're coming to you from
the entrance of District 9

159
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,300
as today, Multi National
United sets out to relocate

160
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,200
approximately 1.8 million alien
residents from their homes.

161
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,200
Human rights groups are
keeping a watchful eye,

162
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,800
as many suspect abuses might occur.

163
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,200
We're seeing heavily armed
private security forces

164
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,700
being deployed into District 9.

165
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,600
Backed up by significant air support.

166
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,400
We'll go shack to shack and
get them to sign the form.

167
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,100
First one EX 247.

168
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,800
We're seeing the convoy stop.
The operation is about to begin.

169
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,700
Just stay focused.

170
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,700
Are you ready,
Thomas? -Yeah. -Okay.

171
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,300
Is that a signal? Okay, fellows.

172
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,100
You stay behind us. Good luck, boy.

173
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,000
Stay low! Where is he going? What is it?

174
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,400
It's clear that security is very high.

175
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,800
This is only the beginning
of a total clamp down.

176
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:30,600
This is MNU agents. Open
the door please! -Open up!

177
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,200
Hello! Hello, hello...

178
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,800
This is Wikus Van De Merwe from MNU.

179
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,200
We are here to serve
you an eviction notice.

180
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,000
You just put your
scrawl there. -Fuck off!

181
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,400
All right! Thomas, hold it!
We've got his scrawl there.

182
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,000
Because as he hit it,
it counts as a scrawl.

183
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,600
First time we come in, there
will always be a little bit

184
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,200
of tension happening
between us and them.

185
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,800
Hey, you can't eat that, man!

186
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,800
The prawn likes to eat the rubber.
To him it's like a marshmallow.

187
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,600
No, no! Guard! Don't
confront him like that!

188
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,200
Did you see that? Right
in the roost. Stay calm!

189
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,800
This is gonna be a problem cause
now all prawns are coming out,

190
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,600
they wanna see what's
going on. Stop it! Stop it!

191
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,200
Bring my kit. See,
everybody is gathering now.

192
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,100
Don't shoot or you're gonna
turn it into a warzone!

193
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,100
What is that? Is that a
tear gas? -No, it's cat food.

194
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,900
It is cat food. I just distract them.

195
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:37,700
One of them attacked the
prawn and he's lost his arm.

196
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,200
No it's not my house. I don't live here.

197
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,100
Well, that's a pity
because, you know, this...

198
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,100
This is a nice cat food, you know.
But of course, it's not your house.

199
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,100
So, we'll just have to go and give it
to someone else. -Yes! It's my house!

200
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,500
We need you to sign here.
Now you can take that...

201
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,700
All right. Stop it!

202
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,200
The creatures became incredibly
obsessed with cat food.

203
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:07,200
Something about it, like catnip
for cats. Only a lot more intense.

204
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,100
Hello? MNU. We are here
to serve eviction notices.

205
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,600
What is eviction?

206
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,200
What we have stranded
on Earth in this colony,

207
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,500
is basically the workers that are
unable to think for themselves.

208
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,200
They will take commands,
they have no initiative.

209
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,600
They've lost all the apt of leadership

210
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,200
through whatever cause.
We presume illness.

211
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:40,100
I'm holding steady over
Nigerian compound area.

212
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,300
Where there's a slum, there's crime.
And District 9 was no exception.

213
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:57,400
The nigerians had various scams going.
One of them was the cat food scam.

214
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,400
Where they sold cat food to the
aliens for exorbitant prices.

215
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:07,400
You put the money here first. You
don't get anything until you pay.

216
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,800
What are you trying to do?
I'll chop your balls off.

217
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,500
Not to mention
interspecies prostitution,

218
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,200
and they also dealt in alien weaponry.

219
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,700
You have a car hijacking,
there's a chop shop there,

220
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,900
you can see that, that's
somebody's car in there.

221
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:25,300
The nigerians in District 9 are
headed by a man called Obesandjo.

222
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,600
He's a very powerful underground
figure in Johannesburg.

223
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,600
You don't want to play with these boys.

224
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,800
They will cut you into pieces.

225
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,600
That's the boss there. OK, no problem.

226
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,800
Don't look at him! This
is gonna cause problems.

227
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,400
All right, next. 766, all right.

228
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,600
MNU agents. Open the door please!

229
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,400
Whoa! Jesus! What is it?

230
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,100
Check the other side!

231
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,500
Control, this is Wikus Van De Merwe.

232
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,500
I need a population control team
at JV 766 immediately, please.

233
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,100
Check the other side, Thomas!
There is 40 to 50 eggs in here.

234
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,300
Is this normal? -This
is an amazing find.

235
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,500
l can just show you a
little bit how it works.

236
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,500
Basically, a cow is hung from
the ceiling, you can see here.

237
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,500
Very little of it left, of
course, because all these pipes

238
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,700
supply the nutrition to
the little prawn eggs.

239
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,300
You can do one, I can show
you, want to see? -No, I'm fine.

240
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,900
There we go. Okay, no
more nutrition to the guy.

241
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,700
Then finally we take air back.

242
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,900
The little guy is gone to
a nice little sleep now.

243
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,200
You pop him out, there
we go. Pop him out here.

244
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,100
You can take that. You wanna keep it
as a souvenir of your first abortion.

245
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,900
You can feel like you did one
of these here. -Thanks, boss.

246
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:52,100
Okay, here it comes,
guys. This is the snake.

247
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,700
If we were going to abort
each egg one at the time,

248
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,400
it'd take a very long time.
So, this makes a lot of sense.

249
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,800
You hear that? That's a popping
sound that you're hearing.

250
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
It's almost like a popcorn.

251
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,400
What the egg does, it pops up.

252
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,400
The little guy, what's
left of him, pops out there.

253
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,600
So that's the sound that
you're hearing with the popping.

254
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,300
You don't need that, man.
Only sissies wear that.

255
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,800
Been drinking a little bit here, eh?

256
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,100
What are you doing with this
television set, sir? What's this?

257
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,400
Hey, smile for the cameras here.

258
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,800
That's a first day
find. -That's a big find.

259
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,700
You see this? Trent, look at this!
There's weapons all over here.

260
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,000
CK 5, 7572...

261
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,300
Some of the guns are small

262
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,700
but if it shoot you, it make a big mess.

263
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,800
MNU is trying to move the
aliens for humanitarian reasons.

264
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,000
But the real focus, just as it has been

265
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,800
right from the beginning, is weapons.

266
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,800
MNU is the second largest
weapons manufacturer in the world.

267
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,800
We assumed that we'd be able
to pick up the alien laser gun

268
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,600
and just be able to shoot,
but it didn't work like that.

269
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,200
Because, as we discovered,
their technology is actually

270
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,800
engineered in a biological manner to
interact exclusively with their DNA.

271
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,200
It just doesn't work with humans.
And it's as simple as that.

272
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,100
This is basically a guy,
and there's 3 humans here.

273
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,900
Basically trying to
make a warning, you know.

274
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,200
He's saying "I kill 3
humans, watch out for me."

275
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,500
Hey, don't urinate on your own
bloody... get back, get back.

276
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:34,100
This is Wikus, requesting
First Battalion escort, please.

277
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,600
You want to talk to them
or you want to talk to me?

278
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,100
No, not them!

279
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:52,100
Okay, guys, thanks very much.
Yeah I know, he had a spade.

280
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,900
Look-I find some!

281
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,400
I tell you before... this is
human technology, it is useless.

282
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,600
Only our technology contains the fluid.

283
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,400
This is not our
technology? -No, it's junk.

284
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,400
Keep looking.

285
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,800
I find something.

286
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,700
Yes. This is what we need.

287
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,200
Good, little one.

288
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,500
Get down!

289
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,500
Careful... wait...

290
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,800
...there.

291
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,400
Why must it take so long?

292
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,800
Because it is very difficult...

293
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,600
...so much can go wrong.

294
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,800
Twenty years of work.

295
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,500
Our plan is ready now?
- Quiet... listen...

296
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,500
...they are coming.

297
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,600
You must hide this.
They must not find it.

298
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,700
Answer the door and be polite.

299
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,000
No! You take it.

300
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,100
You see, this is the problem.
This is the gang sign.

301
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,700
You see this? So again,
looks like we have

302
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,100
more and more gang members.

303
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,900
Fundiswa, you just stay
back. You stay behind Thomas.

304
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,300
This place is swarming with
MNU. I will be searched.

305
00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:00,000
I must get back to my son.
Don't make them angry - be polite!

306
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,800
MNU agents, open the door please.

307
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,200
Hello? We would like you
to... -Nobody is here.

308
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,800
Okay, that's unexceptable.
That is totally unexceptable!

309
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,900
Get out! Get out! You stupid prawn!

310
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,500
- Get outside!
- C'mon! Move! Move!

311
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,600
On your knees! -I'm gonna have a look.

312
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,700
Just stay there! Right there!

313
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,600
Sir, we have to serve
you an eviction notice.

314
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,600
Do you understand it? -No.

315
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,800
This is a classic kind of
gangsta shack, I can tell you.

316
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,800
We're gonna find weapons here.
Watch your head, don't hit the cows.

317
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,900
Just checking for
panels. Ah, you hear that?

318
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,500
Yeah, it's hollow there.

319
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,400
See? Look at that!

320
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,400
I haven't see this type of
setup. It's almost like a...

321
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,000
chemistry type of a set.

322
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,100
It's gotta be something.

323
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,000
l don't know, this has got
the markings there of...

324
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,000
...so it is definitely alien.

325
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:23,000
But it's not a weapon.
But I don't trust it.

326
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:29,300
Are you all right?
Wikus, are you all right?

327
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,100
Switch it off, please. Just turn it off.

328
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,600
Are you gonna cut that part
out, Trent, where it sprays me?

329
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,800
- Yeah, don't worry.
- You cut that.

330
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,300
We just found a dangerous object here.

331
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,700
It has a fuel in and I suspect it
might leak onto people or cause damage.

332
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,400
So we just check that in and we
take that down nicely to the lab.

333
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,700
It's not a weapon but it's dangerous.

334
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,100
He's got weapons somewhere here,
my sense is telling me that.

335
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,800
Lets check the other side
here. Thomas! -Yes sir?

336
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,200
Thomas, keep the gun on
him. -OK, I got it sir!

337
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,800
Keep the gun on him,
Thomas, there's weapons here!

338
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,200
Oh, this is Christmas! This
is Christmas, my friends.

339
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,700
This is the biggest
find that I've ever seen.

340
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,000
Control, come in. Wikus Van De Merwe,

341
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,600
requesting First Reaction Battalion.

342
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,200
Stand by, guys!

343
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,500
This gun I've never
seen. Have you seen this?

344
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,900
This is amazing! Look at
this gun. What gun is this?

345
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,900
This is absolutely amazing!

346
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,300
- What are you doing?
- I wanna show this to Thomas.

347
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,300
But I thought you said
you can't handle it.

348
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,300
No, I am not handling it,
I'm just gonna show it.

349
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,300
I'm not gonna use it, man. It
doesn't even work with humans.

350
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,000
Thomas, look at this gun!

351
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:51,800
- That's not mine.
- You're a dealer, eh? -No.

352
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,500
You hear this, sir? You
see what's happening?

353
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,100
First Battalion, my friend.
You know what that means?

354
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,700
That means that your days of
flaunting the law are over.

355
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,100
Have a look, you see that? What's that?

356
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,400
That's a firing team.

357
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,100
Come here!

358
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,400
Wikus! Are you all right?

359
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,900
Where do you think you're going, eh?

360
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,900
You don't run away from
the chopper. -No, no...

361
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:46,900
Where do you think you're
going? You wanna piss me off?

362
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,900
Koobus to base, come in!

363
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,500
I've got two people down.
MNU guard, MNU agent.

364
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,500
It's the Foxtrot
Yankee 5-3-0... copy?

365
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,200
And we need a Med Evac ASAP.

366
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,100
No, that's fine, Koobus.
I don't need a Med Evac.

367
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,500
Wikus, you burned your
arm, you need to...

368
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,000
I'll just treat it here, Koobus.

369
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,700
Sir, I really think you must go to
a doctor, a hospital or something.

370
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,200
- No, no.
- You should just get it checked out.

371
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,800
I'll just have it treated
by the medics. Help me up.

372
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,000
Did you see how fast
that prawn was, Trent?

373
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,200
- Yeah, he was fast.
- He was fast, I promise you.

374
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:41,000
Look, I fix it. I make it work.

375
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,200
I told you not to touch that.

376
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,400
What is wrong?

377
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,300
Nothing. Go outside
and watch for humans.

378
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,700
Where is your friend?

379
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,100
He's gone.

380
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,900
Are you okay? -Yeah,
I'm just a bit hot.

381
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,400
Are you guys hot? Are
you hot, Trent? -No.

382
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,600
Yeah, if you can't stand the
heat get out of the kitchen.

383
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,500
Now you see. There's kids everywhere.

384
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,600
This is what I mean. That's
why we get rid of them.

385
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,000
- The little ones.
- Yeah, that's why we abort.

386
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,700
Lets just shoot the little bastard.
- No, no, don't shoot it now.

387
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,100
MNU agents! Come out!

388
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,800
Hello, little guy.
MNU has sweets for you.

389
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,400
There you go, eat your sweety.

390
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,200
You know, eaty sweety. Works
like a charm every time.

391
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,100
Oh fuck, man!

392
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,800
You almost poked my eye out
with the fokkin' lollypop.

393
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,400
I tried to be fokkin' nice to you, man!

394
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,000
Is this your fokkin' little brat here?

395
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,100
Inside, go! I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

396
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,600
Teach him some manners.
Thomas, get him out.

397
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,800
Come! Get down! I've had
enough of your stupid games.

398
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,200
What do you want?

399
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,800
We're from MNU. -I know.

400
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,700
We require your scrawl on
this eviction notification.

401
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,700
- Why am I being evicted?
- Yes, it's an eviction notice.

402
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,100
Put your scrawl on the bottom.
See? There's your name at the top.

403
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,100
- Yes! - Christopher Johnson? So, put
your name in the bottom.

404
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,500
It says you must give
me 24 hours notice.

405
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,600
You're going to another place. A nice
new city built especially for prawns.

406
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,600
- A special place! - And we are not
even going to charge you, okay?

407
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,600
This isn't legal. -Sign
the fokkin' paper! -No!

408
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,000
This guy is obviously...
he's a little sharper.

409
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,100
So we are gonna have
to try something else.

410
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,300
All right. Hello... okay.

411
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,700
Seems like we didn't understand
each other there properly, eh?

412
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,100
So, you've got a little one there.

413
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,700
Do you have a licence
for that little one? -Yes.

414
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,200
There's a litter out here. This is
dangerous conditions for your child.

415
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,400
Article 75 says that because
your child is living in dangerous

416
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,200
conditions, I'm gonna take
him down to Child Services.

417
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,400
I'm gonna go and have a
little chat with your son.

418
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,500
You keep away from my child!

419
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,000
Don't point your
fokkin' tentacles at me!

420
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
You said you want to stay?

421
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,800
Your boy is coming down
with me to Child Services.

422
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,900
He's gonna spend the rest of
his life in 1 by 1 meter box.

423
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:18,000
Hello, little guy! It's
the sweety man coming!

424
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,800
Fuck, look at this, Trent! Fuck it!

425
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,300
Thomas, keep the gun on him.
He is definitely a criminal!

426
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,600
He's got a whole
computer shop here, man!

427
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,600
You know, this is amazing.
I mean, this is obviously...

428
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,100
you can see stolen computers now
that he's decorating his place with.

429
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,900
Definitely he doesn't
have the permit for this.

430
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,500
Where is that fokkin' little brat?

431
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,400
Hello! It's the sweety man...

432
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,800
It's the sweety... Hey, I've got this...

433
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,900
- Wikus!
- Trent, turn it off!

434
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,700
Are you okay, boss?
- Fuck off, man! Fuck off!

435
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:15,100
Shall I leave him? -Just
fuckin' leave him, yeah.

436
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:19,000
I'll see you tomorrow,
Christopher Johnson.

437
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
<i>When dealing with aliens,
try to be polite, but firm.</i>

438
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,400
<i>And always remember that a
smile is cheaper than a bullet.</i>

439
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,400
Are you feeling better?
- What? -How are you feeling?

440
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,800
I'm fine, I'm alright. I'm
just a little bit dizzy.

441
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,400
Can you just pull up there on the side?

442
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,900
I just want to get
something to eat here.

443
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,600
Are you sure you should be having that?

444
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,800
After your whole puking episode?

445
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:51,200
I feel a lot better... I think I
just needed the fillings, you know.

446
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,400
Boss! Boss!

447
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:58,800
There's black stuff
coming out of your nose.

448
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,500
Jesus!

449
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,700
It's a silver cylinder. I can't find it.

450
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,900
We must find it. It contains the fluid.

451
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,600
It's not here.

452
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,600
It has to be. Keep looking.

453
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,000
We trade for ten thousand cans.

454
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,600
Certain factions of nigerian gangs

455
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,100
want to try and extract
weaponry from District 9.

456
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,800
And have been trying
to for many many years.

457
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,400
Give them one hundred cans.
- Hundred. -One hundred!

458
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,000
Yes, yes, but we take them all now.

459
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Alright, boys! Get them the catfood
- hurry up.

460
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,300
And they amassed
thousands of these weapons.

461
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,200
Without the ability to use them.

462
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,300
Fuck off! Go! Hey friend,
not you. You stay here.

463
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:06,400
- What do you want from me?
- I just want to talk.

464
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,700
Talk about what?

465
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,700
Stupid prawn. They'll believe anything.

466
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,500
Muti is a South African word.

467
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,100
Today it's synonymous with
witchdoctory and magic.

468
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:22,100
You cut it here. This is their heart.

469
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,900
Cures high blood when you boil it,

470
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,600
cures sugar, diabetes, all diseases.

471
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,400
The nigerians were
consuming alien body parts.

472
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,500
They believed that by doing so,
they were ingesting their power

473
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,200
to use alien weaponry.

474
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,900
You must eat them.

475
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,300
And their power will live in you.

476
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:57,300
Just give me a fucking chance
to go in front of you, man!

477
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,300
Oh, baby! -Hi baby, come in! -I
need to get to the toilet, quickly!

478
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,600
Why? What's the matter?

479
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:14,700
Baby, listen. I might have
crapped in my pants. -Surprise!

480
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:20,200
What's this for? -Your promotion.
- All right, my promotion!

481
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,700
Hello, dad. How is it going?
Hi mom. -Good to see you.

482
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,400
What a surprise, man!
- Congratulations. -Thanks.

483
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,200
Congratulations, boss. -Thank you.

484
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,400
- Wikus, what happened?
- I had a small incident, baby.

485
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,800
I'm just gonna go to the toilet,
and then I'll talk to people, okay?

486
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,600
I need to talk to you. Come with
me. -Okay, but I just gotta...

487
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,100
Guys, can you give us a moment, please?

488
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,500
What happened out there?

489
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,500
This prawn wouldn't listen to
me, one really unruly prawn...

490
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,800
and I just had to...
get him in my grasp.

491
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,800
Listen to me, too many
aliens died out there today.

492
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,400
UYO is all over my backside.

493
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,800
Focus! you're not going
to fuck this up for me!

494
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:06,400
If you can't do the job,
I'll find someone who can!

495
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,500
Hi there! -Nice to see you again.

496
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,200
Does this mean he's in
charge of this new operation?

497
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,400
- Yes.
- That's nice.

498
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,500
Wikus! Baby are you okay?

499
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,400
Okay, let's cut some cake.

500
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:07,300
<i>Doctor Smith, please come
to room 405, doctor Smith.</i>

501
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:14,600
Is it badly infected?
- There's a lot of suppuration.

502
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,500
Also you should know on my right hand
some fingernails were coming loose.

503
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:24,500
And I had a black fluid coming out
of my nose, and sort of a black vomit.

504
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,800
What is happening to my arm, doctor?

505
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,000
What is this thing?

506
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,200
Just breathe deeply.
Calm down. Stay calm.

507
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,100
Sir, please tell my wife.

508
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:46,900
<i>Attention all medical
containment evacuate ward 11.</i>

509
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,900
Stop right there, madam.

510
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,500
What's going on? What
are you doing to him?

511
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,100
Let me through!

512
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,100
Wikus! Wikus! Where are you taking him?

513
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:37,500
Okay, got him? Are you ready? -Got him.

514
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,400
We decided not to use the anesthetic,

515
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,400
the reason being we can't know
how the subject will react.

516
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:04,000
Doctor Fester! -Yes? -I
think you should see this.

517
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:09,500
I found it in his jacket.
You think this is alien?

518
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,700
Stop, it's freezing! Fuck!

519
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,700
16 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

520
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,700
Where is this?

521
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,100
What?

522
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,500
What are they doing to these prawns?

523
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,600
Pain threshold, test one, DBX 7.

524
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:55,400
That's a strong pain reaction.
That means the nerves have fused.

525
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,600
I mean, it's almost
completely integrated.

526
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,800
Okay, do it.

527
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,800
B5. Testing AMR-B5.

528
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,700
Clear the range. Now, quickly!

529
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,100
Swing it around.

530
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,100
What are you doing?
- The door is locked.

531
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,500
Can you grip that? -What is this?

532
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,200
- Put it through.
- Why are you doing this?

533
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,300
- Standby for fire. Standby.
- You want me to shoot that?

534
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,900
Stand back... and fire!

535
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,700
That's good!

536
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,000
It worked!

537
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,200
All right, thanks very much.

538
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,800
Do you know where my wife is?

539
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,800
Do you know if my wife
knows where I am, sir?

540
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,500
Pull! Pull!

541
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,700
No sir, I will not pull.

542
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:55,100
What did you say about
your wife? Fuck your wife!

543
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,700
Pull! -I will not pull.

544
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,400
Fire!

545
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:09,000
B7. -I can pull it.
- He says he can pull it.

546
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,600
I said I could pull it! You fuckin'...!

547
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,600
B21.

548
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,000
Move, hurry up. Move!

549
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Right, we want him in the center
by the chain. -Get this off me.

550
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,200
Come on! Time, time!

551
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:33,100
Leave that fucking prawn, man, I
will shoot at pig. I'll shoot, sir!

552
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,300
Listen, I'll shoot at pig again
for you. I'll pull the trigger.

553
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,800
But I'm not shooting at prawn,
you hear me? Untie the fucking gun.

554
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,700
B21 in human hand.
That's good. It worked.

555
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,200
Just untie the gun, sir. -Stand by.

556
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,700
Listen, you can't use the real
guy, he didn't do anything to you.

557
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:56,300
I want to try this.
Everybody standing by.

558
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:00,000
Ready to go? Three, two, one, go!

559
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,600
Amazing!

560
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:13,800
All right! I think that's all we need.

561
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,500
Gentlemen, we are running out of time.

562
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,700
This is the key stage
in the metamorphosis.

563
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,200
His DNA is in perfect balance
between alien and human.

564
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,200
And a problem is, as
the infection spreads,

565
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,200
the transition becomes
permanent and less active.

566
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,000
He's going to turn into
one of them. A prawn!

567
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,100
What happens to him isn't important.

568
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:39,300
What's important is that we harvest
from him what we can right now.

569
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,500
This body represents
hundreds of millions,

570
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,000
maybe billions of dollars
worth of biotechnology.

571
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,300
There are people out there,
governments, corporations,

572
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,200
who'd kill for this chance.

573
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,800
Will he survive the
procedure? -No, of course not.

574
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,600
We need everything.
Tissue, bone marrow, blood.

575
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,300
The procedure is gonna basically
strip him down to nothing. -Please...

576
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,600
What about next of kin?

577
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,400
Please help me. Don't let them do it.

578
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,700
I'll handle that.

579
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:15,900
Okay, I say let's go. -Good, thank you.

580
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,000
I don't understand.

581
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:34,200
None of this makes any sense.
He just hurt his arm, dad.

582
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,000
The doctors are trying, sweetheart.

583
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,200
Doing their best to save him.

584
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,900
We're starting to harvest
material from the specimen.

585
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,800
We'll start with the soft tissue
first. Cut through the chest cavern.

586
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,800
We need to get the heart
out as quickly as possible.

587
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,300
Once it set the
sinuosity, it just spread.

588
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,600
You know Wikus. He
never was very strong.

589
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,500
I'll go through the chest,
go straight into the heart.

590
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,800
Be quiet, please. -Fuck you!

591
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,100
Can I see him?

592
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,100
Not a good idea.

593
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,400
Fuck off! Fuck you!

594
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,400
Fuck you!

595
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,100
Drop the knife!

596
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,200
Move or I'll fuckin' cut his throat!

597
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,300
Okay. All right!

598
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,200
I'll fuckin' kill him!

599
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,100
You need to let go of him now.

600
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:09,200
It's okay, Tania.
Everything will be okay.

601
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,700
Smith.

602
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,700
When?

603
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,100
Get Koobus.

604
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,400
<i>...Wikus Van De Merwe.</i>

605
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,100
<i>White male, mid thirties. Is
considered highly dangerous.</i>

606
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:11,300
- Hey baby.
- Wikus, is that you?

607
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,600
- Mrs. Smith?
- How dare you phone us!

608
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,600
What are all these people doing in
my house? -It's none of your business.

609
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,700
I need to speak to Tania straight
away, please. It's my house.

610
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,000
This is my phone that you're
using, mam. I'm fokkin'... what?

611
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,200
He tried calling me.

612
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:28,300
Anton, it's me! It's
me! Accept the call!

613
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:32,000
I've been friends with you
for fokkin' 13 years, man!

614
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,900
Fuck off! What are
you watching? Fuck off!

615
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,900
We all thought it was for the
best because he needed help.

616
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,900
A special medical help.

617
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:44,600
And he wasn't gonna
get that as a fugitive.

618
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:53,900
He became the most valuable
business artifact on Earth.

619
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,100
He was the only human who had ever...

620
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:01,300
successfully been combined with
alien genetics and remained alive.

621
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:07,300
But his real value was that he
could operate alien weaponry.

622
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,500
Hello.

623
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,400
Can I get some cheese burgers
and one large sauerkraut, please.

624
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,100
<i>We interrupt this program

627

628
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:34,700
This is nonsense. -I

629
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:37,100
That is totally untrue. You

31 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

639
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,600
Hi, this is Tania. -And Wikus.

640
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,200
We can't come to the phone right now.

641
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,200
Please leave a message. Bye. -Bye bye.

642
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:33,400
<i>Control, there's no
sign of mr Van De Merwe.</i>

643
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:00,800
The entire world was watching him.

644
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:05,300
He was on every radio station,
every image on television,

645
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:08,300
anything you could
find had his face on it.

646
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:12,200
So he had nowhere else to go. He
ended up hiding in the one place

647
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:17,400
he knew no one would
ever come looking for him.
