1
00:01:21,007 --> 00:01:23,282
From the day we arrive

2
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:26,325
On the planet

3
00:01:26,407 --> 00:01:29,956
And, blinking, step into the sun

4
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:34,237
There's more to see

5
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:37,125
Than can ever be seen

6
00:01:37,207 --> 00:01:39,038
More to do

7
00:01:39,127 --> 00:01:42,005
Than can ever be done

8
00:01:43,607 --> 00:01:45,245
There's far too much

9
00:01:45,327 --> 00:01:48,000
To take in here

10
00:01:48,087 --> 00:01:49,600
More to find

11
00:01:49,687 --> 00:01:51,996
Than can ever be found

12
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,239
But the sun rolling high

13
00:01:56,327 --> 00:01:58,795
Through the sapphire sky

14
00:01:58,887 --> 00:02:00,798
Keeps great and small

15
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:03,685
On the endless round

16
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:08,761
It's the circle of life

17
00:02:08,847 --> 00:02:14,558
And it moves us all

18
00:02:14,647 --> 00:02:18,765
Through despair and hope

19
00:02:20,247 --> 00:02:25,605
Through faith and love

20
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:30,397
Till we find our place

21
00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:36,244
On the path unwinding

22
00:02:37,527 --> 00:02:42,078
In the circle

23
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:46,957
The circle of life

24
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:34,886
It's the circle of life

25
00:03:36,847 --> 00:03:39,441
And it moves us all

26
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:46,399
Through despair and hope

27
00:03:47,847 --> 00:03:53,160
Through faith and love

28
00:03:53,247 --> 00:03:58,446
Till we find our place

29
00:03:58,527 --> 00:04:04,762
On the path unwinding

30
00:04:04,847 --> 00:04:09,682
In the circle

31
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:15,797
The circle of life

32
00:04:36,327 --> 00:04:39,125
Life's not fair, is it?

33
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:40,606
You see, I...

34
00:04:40,687 --> 00:04:43,201
Well, I shall never be king.

35
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,326
And you...

36
00:04:46,407 --> 00:04:48,637
shall never see
the light of another day.

37
00:04:49,807 --> 00:04:51,240
Adieu.

38
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,364
Didn't your mother ever tell you
not to play with your food?

39
00:04:54,447 --> 00:04:56,278
What do you want?

40
00:04:56,367 --> 00:04:59,598
I'm here to announce that
King Mufasa's on his way,

41
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:03,123
so you'd better have a good excuse
for missing this morning's ceremony.

42
00:05:03,207 --> 00:05:04,720
Oh, look, Zazu.

43
00:05:04,807 --> 00:05:06,035
You've made me lose my lunch.

44
00:05:06,127 --> 00:05:08,925
You'll lose more than that
when the king gets through with you.

45
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:11,567
He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia.

46
00:05:12,047 --> 00:05:14,959
I quiver with fear!

47
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:17,481
Now, Scar, don't look at me that way.

48
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,443
Help!

49
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:21,041
Scar?

50
00:05:21,127 --> 00:05:22,162
Drop him.

51
00:05:22,247 --> 00:05:25,319
Impeccable timing, Your Majesty.

52
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:32,326
Why, if it isn't my big brother
descending from on high

53
00:05:32,407 --> 00:05:34,363
to mingle with the commoners.

54
00:05:34,447 --> 00:05:37,359
Sarabi and I didn't see you
at the presentation of Simba.

55
00:05:37,447 --> 00:05:39,483
That was today?

56
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:41,639
I feel simply awful!

57
00:05:43,647 --> 00:05:45,683
Must've slipped my mind.

58
00:05:45,767 --> 00:05:48,884
Yes, well, as slippery
as your mind is,

59
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:51,527
as the king's brother,
you should've been first in line!

60
00:05:52,927 --> 00:05:56,556
Well, I was first in line,
until the little hairball was born.

61
00:05:56,647 --> 00:06:01,357
That hairball is my son
and your future king.

62
00:06:01,447 --> 00:06:04,086
I shall practice my curtsy!

63
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:06,476
Don't turn your back on me, Scar.

64
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,000
Oh, no, Mufasa.

65
00:06:08,087 --> 00:06:10,726
Perhaps you shouldn't
turn your back on me.

66
00:06:12,007 --> 00:06:13,520
Is that a challenge?

67
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:15,165
Temper, temper.

68
00:06:15,247 --> 00:06:18,284
I wouldn't dream of challenging you.

69
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,244
Pity. Why not?

70
00:06:20,327 --> 00:06:23,524
Well, as far as brains go,
I got the lion's share.

71
00:06:23,607 --> 00:06:26,804
But when it comes
to brute strength...

72
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:30,880
I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end
of the gene pool.

73
00:06:33,487 --> 00:06:36,001
There's one in every family, sire.

74
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:37,566
Two in mine, actually -

75
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,639
and they always manage to
ruin special occasions.

76
00:06:40,727 --> 00:06:42,638
What am I going to do with him?

77
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:44,399
He'd make a very
handsome throw rug.

78
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,522
Zazu!

79
00:06:45,607 --> 00:06:47,916
And just think,
whenever he gets dirty,

80
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,998
you could take him out and beat him.

81
00:07:33,647 --> 00:07:35,239
Simba.

82
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:49,519
Dad!

83
00:07:49,607 --> 00:07:51,882
Come on, dad, we gotta go! Wake up!

84
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:54,599
Sorry.

85
00:07:55,247 --> 00:07:57,158
Dad!

86
00:07:57,247 --> 00:08:00,319
Your son is awake.

87
00:08:00,407 --> 00:08:03,319
Before sunrise, he's your son.

88
00:08:03,407 --> 00:08:05,443
Come on, dad.

89
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:11,165
You promised.

90
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,198
OK. I'm up.

91
00:08:30,647 --> 00:08:31,841
Look, Simba.

92
00:08:31,927 --> 00:08:35,966
Everything the light
touches is our kingdom.

93
00:08:37,807 --> 00:08:42,517
A king's time as ruler
rises and falls like the sun.

94
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:46,395
One day, Simba,
the sun will set on my time here

95
00:08:46,487 --> 00:08:49,445
and will rise with you
as the new king.

96
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:51,040
And this'll all be mine?

97
00:08:51,127 --> 00:08:52,037
Everything.

98
00:08:52,127 --> 00:08:55,244
Everything the light touches.

99
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,238
What about that shadowy place?

100
00:08:57,327 --> 00:08:58,999
That's beyond our borders.

101
00:08:59,087 --> 00:09:00,679
You must never go there, Simba.

102
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:02,644
I thought a king
can do whatever he wants.

103
00:09:02,727 --> 00:09:06,117
Oh, there's more to being king
than getting your way all the time.

104
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:08,277
- There's more?
- Simba...!

105
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:15,725
Everything you see exists together
in a delicate balance.

106
00:09:15,807 --> 00:09:18,640
As king, you need to
understand that balance

107
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:20,365
and respect all the creatures,

108
00:09:20,447 --> 00:09:23,439
from the crawling ant
to the leaping antelope.

109
00:09:23,527 --> 00:09:25,358
But, dad, don't we eat the antelope?

110
00:09:25,447 --> 00:09:27,881
Yes, Simba, but let me explain.

111
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,686
When we die, our bodies
become the grass,

112
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:33,156
and the antelope eat the grass.

113
00:09:33,247 --> 00:09:38,605
And so we are all connected
in the great circle of life.

114
00:09:38,687 --> 00:09:39,722
Good morning, sire!

115
00:09:39,807 --> 00:09:40,796
Good morning, Zazu.

116
00:09:40,887 --> 00:09:42,605
Checking in with the morning report.

117
00:09:42,687 --> 00:09:43,756
Fire away.

118
00:09:43,847 --> 00:09:45,075
Chimps are going ape

119
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,759
Giraffe remain above it all

120
00:09:46,847 --> 00:09:48,121
Elephants remember

121
00:09:48,207 --> 00:09:49,640
Though just what, I can't recall

122
00:09:49,727 --> 00:09:50,955
Crocodiles are snapping up

123
00:09:51,047 --> 00:09:52,560
Fresh offers from the banks

124
00:09:52,647 --> 00:09:54,000
Shown interest in my nest egg

125
00:09:54,087 --> 00:09:55,839
But I quickly said no thanks

126
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:57,326
We haven't paid the hornbills

127
00:09:57,407 --> 00:09:58,726
And the vultures have a hunch

128
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,035
Not everyone invited

129
00:10:00,127 --> 00:10:02,766
Will be coming back from lunch

130
00:10:04,447 --> 00:10:07,245
This is the morning report

131
00:10:07,327 --> 00:10:09,682
Gives you the long and the short

132
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,519
It's every grunt, roar, and snort

133
00:10:13,607 --> 00:10:16,485
It's not a tale I distort

134
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:20,640
On the morning report

135
00:10:20,727 --> 00:10:22,206
What are you doing, son?

136
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:23,163
Pouncing.

137
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,636
Let an old pro show you
how it's done.

138
00:10:25,727 --> 00:10:27,558
Oh, the buffalo have got a beef

139
00:10:27,647 --> 00:10:31,117
Stay low to the ground.

140
00:10:31,207 --> 00:10:33,641
OK. Stay low to the ground.

141
00:10:34,007 --> 00:10:35,645
Not a sound.

142
00:10:35,727 --> 00:10:38,480
Saffron is this season's colour
Seen in all the herds

143
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:39,636
Take it slow.

144
00:10:39,727 --> 00:10:42,241
One more step...

145
00:10:42,327 --> 00:10:43,282
then...

146
00:10:46,207 --> 00:10:49,199
This is the morning report

147
00:10:49,287 --> 00:10:51,721
Gives you the long and the short

148
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:54,762
Every grunt, roar, and snort

149
00:10:55,527 --> 00:10:57,916
Not a tale I distort

150
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:02,076
On the morning report

151
00:11:08,745 --> 00:11:09,734
That's very good.

152
00:11:09,825 --> 00:11:11,053
- Zazu!
- Yes!

153
00:11:11,145 --> 00:11:12,737
Sir! News from the underground.

154
00:11:12,825 --> 00:11:13,940
Now, this time...

155
00:11:14,025 --> 00:11:17,461
Sire! Hyenas in the pride lands!

156
00:11:17,545 --> 00:11:18,739
Zazu, take Simba home.

157
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:20,178
Can't I come?

158
00:11:20,265 --> 00:11:21,983
No, son.

159
00:11:22,505 --> 00:11:24,541
I never get to go anywhere.

160
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:28,174
Oh, young master,
one day you will be king.

161
00:11:28,265 --> 00:11:32,338
Then you can chase those
slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers

162
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,381
from dawn until dusk.

163
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:43,463
Hey, Uncle Scar! Guess what?

164
00:11:43,545 --> 00:11:46,582
I despise guessing games.

165
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,656
I'm gonna be King of Pride Rock.

166
00:11:48,745 --> 00:11:50,656
Oh, goody!

167
00:11:50,745 --> 00:11:52,656
My dad just showed me
the whole kingdom,

168
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,384
and I'm gonna rule it all!

169
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:59,014
Yes. Well, forgive me
for not leaping for joy.

170
00:11:59,105 --> 00:12:01,300
Bad back, you know.

171
00:12:02,345 --> 00:12:05,621
Hey, Uncle Scar. When I'm king,
what'll that make you?

172
00:12:05,705 --> 00:12:08,014
A monkey's uncle.

173
00:12:08,105 --> 00:12:11,381
- You're so weird.
- You have no idea.

174
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:14,901
So, your father showed you
the whole kingdom, did he?

175
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:15,974
Everything.

176
00:12:16,065 --> 00:12:19,057
He didn't show you what's beyond
that rise at the northern border?

177
00:12:19,145 --> 00:12:22,501
Well, no. He said I can't go there.

178
00:12:22,585 --> 00:12:24,496
And he's absolutely right.

179
00:12:24,585 --> 00:12:25,813
It's far too dangerous.

180
00:12:25,905 --> 00:12:28,260
Only the bravest lions go there.

181
00:12:28,345 --> 00:12:30,939
Well, I'm brave. What's out there?

182
00:12:31,025 --> 00:12:33,095
I'm sorry, Simba,
I just can't tell you.

183
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,220
Why not?

184
00:12:34,305 --> 00:12:38,742
I'm only looking out for the
well-being of my favourite nephew.

185
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,544
Yeah, right! I'm your only nephew.

186
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,014
All the more reason
for me to be protective.

187
00:12:44,105 --> 00:12:48,178
An elephant graveyard is no place
for a young prince. Oops!

188
00:12:48,265 --> 00:12:50,620
An elephant what?

189
00:12:50,705 --> 00:12:53,663
Oh, dear, I've said too much.

190
00:12:53,745 --> 00:12:56,578
Well, I suppose you'd have
found out sooner or later,

191
00:12:56,665 --> 00:12:59,418
you being so clever and all.

192
00:12:59,505 --> 00:13:01,143
Just do me one favour.

193
00:13:01,225 --> 00:13:05,616
Promise me you'll never visit
that dreadful place.

194
00:13:05,705 --> 00:13:07,058
No problem.

195
00:13:07,145 --> 00:13:08,703
There's a good lad.

196
00:13:08,785 --> 00:13:11,424
You run along now and have fun.

197
00:13:11,505 --> 00:13:12,938
And remember,

198
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,414
it's our little secret.

199
00:13:22,065 --> 00:13:24,181
- Hey, Nala.
- Hi, Simba.

200
00:13:24,265 --> 00:13:26,415
Come on. I just heard
about this great place.

201
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:28,814
Simba! I'm kind of
in the middle of a bath.

202
00:13:28,905 --> 00:13:30,861
And it's time for yours.

203
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,340
Mom!

204
00:13:34,425 --> 00:13:36,814
Mom, you're messing up my mane!

205
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:40,619
OK, I'm clean. Can we go now?

206
00:13:40,705 --> 00:13:41,933
So, where are we going?

207
00:13:42,025 --> 00:13:43,538
It better not be anyplace dumb.

208
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,297
No, it's really cool.

209
00:13:45,385 --> 00:13:47,853
So, where is this really cool place?

210
00:13:49,145 --> 00:13:51,705
- Around the water hole.
- The water hole?

211
00:13:51,785 --> 00:13:53,662
What's so great about the water hole?

212
00:13:53,745 --> 00:13:55,815
I'll show you when we get there.

213
00:13:57,145 --> 00:13:58,897
Mom, can I go with Simba?

214
00:13:58,985 --> 00:14:00,976
What do you think, Sarabi?

215
00:14:01,065 --> 00:14:02,134
Well...

216
00:14:02,225 --> 00:14:03,578
Please?

217
00:14:03,665 --> 00:14:04,734
It's all right with me.

218
00:14:04,825 --> 00:14:05,860
- Yeah!
- All right!

219
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,697
As long as Zazu goes with you.

220
00:14:07,745 --> 00:14:09,656
No, not Zazu.

221
00:14:09,785 --> 00:14:10,740
Step lively.

222
00:14:10,825 --> 00:14:14,659
The sooner we get to the water hole,
the sooner we can leave.

223
00:14:14,745 --> 00:14:16,542
So, where are we really going?

224
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,978
An elephant graveyard.

225
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,020
Wow!

226
00:14:19,905 --> 00:14:20,701
Zazu.

227
00:14:20,785 --> 00:14:23,379
Right. So, how are we
gonna ditch the dodo?

228
00:14:23,465 --> 00:14:26,263
Oh, just look at you two.

229
00:14:26,345 --> 00:14:29,337
Little seeds of romance
blossoming in the savanna.

230
00:14:29,425 --> 00:14:31,541
Your parents will be thrilled,

231
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,855
what with your being
betrothed and all.

232
00:14:33,945 --> 00:14:34,821
Be-what?

233
00:14:34,905 --> 00:14:36,657
Betrothed. Intended.

234
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:38,542
Affianced.

235
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,660
Meaning...?

236
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,703
One day, you two are
going to be married.

237
00:14:43,745 --> 00:14:45,861
I can't marry her. She's my friend.

238
00:14:45,945 --> 00:14:48,061
Yeah, it'd be so weird.

239
00:14:48,145 --> 00:14:50,022
Sorry to bust your bubble,

240
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:52,619
but you two turtle doves
have no choice.

241
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:55,060
It's a tradition
going back generations.

242
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:57,613
When I'm king,
that'll be the first thing to go.

243
00:14:57,705 --> 00:14:58,933
Not so long as I'm around.

244
00:14:59,025 --> 00:15:00,424
In that case, you're fired.

245
00:15:00,505 --> 00:15:02,814
Nice try,
but only the king can do that.

246
00:15:02,905 --> 00:15:04,418
Well, he's the future king.

247
00:15:04,505 --> 00:15:06,735
Yeah, so you have to
do what I tell you.

248
00:15:06,825 --> 00:15:08,178
Not yet, I don't.

249
00:15:08,265 --> 00:15:09,618
And with an attitude like that,

250
00:15:09,705 --> 00:15:13,334
I'm afraid you're shaping up to be
a pretty pathetic king, indeed.

251
00:15:13,425 --> 00:15:14,938
Not the way I see it.

252
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:18,181
I'm gonna be a mighty king

253
00:15:18,265 --> 00:15:20,017
So enemies beware

254
00:15:20,105 --> 00:15:22,619
Well, I've never seen
a king of beasts

255
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:24,775
With quite so little hair

256
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:27,217
I'm gonna be the main event

257
00:15:27,305 --> 00:15:29,455
Like no king was before

258
00:15:29,545 --> 00:15:31,900
I'm brushin' up on lookin' down

259
00:15:31,985 --> 00:15:34,340
I'm workin' on my roar

260
00:15:34,425 --> 00:15:37,895
Thus far, a rather
uninspiring thing

261
00:15:38,785 --> 00:15:42,334
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

262
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:45,576
You've rather a long way to go,
young master, if you think...

263
00:15:45,665 --> 00:15:48,054
- No one sayin', "do this"
- Now, when I said that...

264
00:15:48,145 --> 00:15:50,454
- No one saying, "be there"
- What I meant was...

265
00:15:50,545 --> 00:15:53,503
- No one sayin', "stop that"
- But what you don't realise...

266
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:55,815
- No one sayin', "see here"
- Now, see here!

267
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:58,135
Free to run around all day

268
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:00,102
Well, that's definitely out.

269
00:16:00,185 --> 00:16:04,019
Free to do it all my way

270
00:16:07,185 --> 00:16:09,141
I think it's time that you and I

271
00:16:09,225 --> 00:16:11,181
Arranged a heart-to-heart

272
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:13,184
Kings don't need advice

273
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:15,495
From little hornbills for a start

274
00:16:16,345 --> 00:16:19,018
If this is where
the monarchy is headed

275
00:16:19,105 --> 00:16:20,333
Count me out

276
00:16:20,425 --> 00:16:22,814
Out of service, out of Africa

277
00:16:22,905 --> 00:16:25,294
I wouldn't hang about

278
00:16:25,945 --> 00:16:29,540
This child is getting
wildly out of wing

279
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:33,903
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

280
00:16:45,945 --> 00:16:47,424
Everybody, look left

281
00:16:48,505 --> 00:16:50,382
Everybody, look right

282
00:16:50,465 --> 00:16:52,854
Everywhere you look, I'm

283
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,503
Standing in the spotlight

284
00:16:54,585 --> 00:16:56,223
Not yet!

285
00:16:56,305 --> 00:16:59,900
Let every creature
go for broke and sing

286
00:17:00,425 --> 00:17:03,701
Let's hear it in the herd
and on the wing

287
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:09,184
It's gonna be
King Simba's finest fling

288
00:17:09,265 --> 00:17:13,975
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

289
00:17:14,065 --> 00:17:18,695
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

290
00:17:18,785 --> 00:17:23,415
Oh, I just can't wait

291
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,616
To be king

292
00:17:32,305 --> 00:17:35,183
I beg your pardon, madam, but...

293
00:17:35,265 --> 00:17:37,176
Get off!

294
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:38,778
Simba?

295
00:17:38,865 --> 00:17:40,617
Nala!

296
00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:44,664
All right! It worked!

297
00:17:44,745 --> 00:17:45,780
We lost him.

298
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:47,139
I am a genius.

299
00:17:47,225 --> 00:17:49,056
Hey, genius, it was my idea.

300
00:17:49,145 --> 00:17:51,181
Yeah, but I pulled it off.

301
00:17:51,265 --> 00:17:53,221
- With me!
- Oh, yeah?

302
00:17:56,185 --> 00:17:59,177
- Pinned ya.
- Hey, let me up!

303
00:18:03,945 --> 00:18:05,936
Pinned ya again.

304
00:18:17,185 --> 00:18:19,494
This is it. We made it.

305
00:18:27,825 --> 00:18:29,861
It's really creepy.

306
00:18:29,945 --> 00:18:30,980
Yeah.

307
00:18:31,065 --> 00:18:32,259
Isn't it great?

308
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:33,903
We could get in big trouble.

309
00:18:33,985 --> 00:18:35,179
I know!

310
00:18:35,265 --> 00:18:38,302
I wonder if its brains
are still in there.

311
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:40,216
There's only one way to know.

312
00:18:40,305 --> 00:18:42,023
Come on, let's go check it out.

313
00:18:42,105 --> 00:18:44,460
Wrong! The only
checking out you will do

314
00:18:44,545 --> 00:18:46,900
- will be to check out of here.
- Oh, man!

315
00:18:46,985 --> 00:18:49,340
We're way beyond the boundary
of the pride lands.

316
00:18:49,425 --> 00:18:50,938
Look, banana beak is scared.

317
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:53,744
It's Mr banana beak to you, fuzzy,

318
00:18:53,825 --> 00:18:57,022
and right now we are all
in very real danger.

319
00:18:57,105 --> 00:18:58,504
Danger? Ha!

320
00:18:58,585 --> 00:19:00,576
I walk on the wide side.

321
00:19:00,665 --> 00:19:02,815
I laugh in the face of danger.

322
00:19:11,345 --> 00:19:14,462
Well, well, well, Banzai,
what have we got here?

323
00:19:14,545 --> 00:19:16,376
I don't know, Shenzi.

324
00:19:16,465 --> 00:19:17,978
What do you think, Ed?

325
00:19:20,065 --> 00:19:22,533
Just what I was thinking.

326
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,536
A trio of trespassers!

327
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,775
And quite by accident,
let me assure you.

328
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,617
A simple navigational error.

329
00:19:28,705 --> 00:19:30,582
Whoa, wait.

330
00:19:30,665 --> 00:19:34,374
I know you.
You're Mufasa's little stooge.

331
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,695
I, madam, am
the king's major-domo.

332
00:19:36,785 --> 00:19:38,377
And that would make you...

333
00:19:38,465 --> 00:19:39,693
The future king.

334
00:19:39,785 --> 00:19:43,141
Do you know what we do to kings
who step out of their kingdom?

335
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:45,944
Huh! You can't do anything to me.

336
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:48,175
Technically, they can.
We are on their land.

337
00:19:48,265 --> 00:19:52,304
But you told me they're nothing but
slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers.

338
00:19:52,385 --> 00:19:53,864
Lx-nay on the upid-stay.

339
00:19:53,945 --> 00:19:55,697
Who are you callin' upid-stay?

340
00:19:55,785 --> 00:19:56,934
Oh, look at the sun!

341
00:19:57,025 --> 00:19:59,016
- It's time to go!
- What's the hurry?

342
00:19:59,105 --> 00:20:00,936
We'd love you to
stick around for dinner.

343
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:04,301
Yeah, we could have
whatever's lion around!

344
00:20:04,385 --> 00:20:06,216
Wait, wait, wait,
I got one, I got one!

345
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:09,024
Make mine a cub sandwich!
Whaddaya think?

346
00:20:10,985 --> 00:20:13,340
What, Ed? What is it?

347
00:20:13,425 --> 00:20:15,143
Hey, did we order this dinner to go?

348
00:20:15,225 --> 00:20:16,260
No, why?

349
00:20:16,345 --> 00:20:18,301
Cos there it goes!

350
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,859
- Did we lose 'em?
- I think so.

351
00:20:26,945 --> 00:20:28,298
Where's Zazu?

352
00:20:28,385 --> 00:20:30,421
The little major-domo bird
hippety-hopped

353
00:20:30,505 --> 00:20:32,461
all the way to the birdie-boiler.

354
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:35,105
Oh, no! Not the birdie-boiler!

355
00:20:38,665 --> 00:20:41,782
Hey, why don't you pick
on somebody your own size?

356
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:44,015
Like you?

357
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:22,055
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

358
00:21:25,825 --> 00:21:27,144
That was it?

359
00:21:28,425 --> 00:21:30,017
Do it again. Come on.

360
00:21:41,505 --> 00:21:44,019
- Oh, please! Uncle!
- Silence!

361
00:21:44,105 --> 00:21:46,983
- We're gonna shut up right now!
- We're really sorry.

362
00:21:47,065 --> 00:21:50,262
If you ever come near my son again...

363
00:21:50,345 --> 00:21:51,937
Oh, this is... this is your son?

364
00:21:52,025 --> 00:21:54,095
- Oh, your son?
- Did you know that?

365
00:21:54,185 --> 00:21:56,494
No. Me? I didn't know... No, did you?

366
00:21:56,585 --> 00:21:58,382
- No, of course not.
- No.

367
00:21:58,465 --> 00:22:00,979
Ed?

368
00:22:02,705 --> 00:22:03,979
Toodles.

369
00:22:10,945 --> 00:22:13,584
- Dad, I...
- You deliberately disobeyed me.

370
00:22:14,865 --> 00:22:17,698
- Dad, I'm... I'm sorry.
- Let's go home.

371
00:22:20,225 --> 00:22:22,693
I thought you were very brave.

372
00:22:38,785 --> 00:22:40,218
Zazu.

373
00:22:42,185 --> 00:22:43,664
Yes, sire?

374
00:22:43,745 --> 00:22:47,863
Take Nala home.
I've got to teach my son a lesson.

375
00:22:51,905 --> 00:22:53,736
Come, Nala.

376
00:22:53,825 --> 00:22:57,101
Simba... good luck.

377
00:23:30,985 --> 00:23:32,816
Simba, I'm very disappointed in you.

378
00:23:32,905 --> 00:23:35,214
- I know.
- You could've been killed.

379
00:23:35,305 --> 00:23:37,182
You deliberately disobeyed me,

380
00:23:37,265 --> 00:23:40,814
and what's worse,
you put Nala in danger.

381
00:23:40,905 --> 00:23:43,373
I was just trying
to be brave, like you.

382
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:46,696
I'm only brave when I have to be.

383
00:23:49,145 --> 00:23:50,294
Being brave

384
00:23:50,385 --> 00:23:52,615
doesn't mean you go
looking for trouble.

385
00:23:52,705 --> 00:23:54,616
But you're not scared of anything.

386
00:23:55,745 --> 00:23:56,860
I was today.

387
00:23:56,945 --> 00:23:59,015
- You were?
- Yes.

388
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:01,141
I thought I might lose you.

389
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:05,059
I guess even kings get scared.

390
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:08,495
- But you know what?
- What?

391
00:24:08,585 --> 00:24:11,019
I think those hyenas
were even scareder.

392
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:15,577
Cos nobody messes with your dad.

393
00:24:15,665 --> 00:24:17,974
- Come here, you.
- Oh, no!

394
00:24:23,865 --> 00:24:24,980
Gotcha!

395
00:24:30,025 --> 00:24:31,504
Dad?

396
00:24:31,585 --> 00:24:34,224
- We're pals, right?
- Right.

397
00:24:34,305 --> 00:24:36,944
And we'll always be together, right?

398
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:40,898
Simba, let me tell you something

399
00:24:40,985 --> 00:24:43,658
that my father told me.

400
00:24:43,745 --> 00:24:45,576
Look at the stars.

401
00:24:45,665 --> 00:24:47,940
The great kings of the past

402
00:24:48,025 --> 00:24:50,493
look down on us from those stars.

403
00:24:50,585 --> 00:24:52,780
- Really?
- Yes.

404
00:24:52,865 --> 00:24:55,095
So whenever you feel alone,

405
00:24:55,185 --> 00:24:57,335
just remember that those kings

406
00:24:57,425 --> 00:25:01,100
will always be there to guide you.

407
00:25:01,185 --> 00:25:02,903
And so will I.

408
00:25:09,065 --> 00:25:12,535
Man, that lousy Mufasa.
I won't be able to sit for a week.

409
00:25:15,985 --> 00:25:19,455
It's not funny, Ed.

410
00:25:21,185 --> 00:25:23,301
Shut up!

411
00:25:25,785 --> 00:25:27,343
Will you knock it off?

412
00:25:28,705 --> 00:25:31,617
- Well, he started it.
- Look at you guys.

413
00:25:31,705 --> 00:25:34,060
No wonder we're dangling
at the bottom of the food chain.

414
00:25:34,145 --> 00:25:35,544
Man, I hate dangling.

415
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:39,334
Yeah? If it weren't for those lions,
we'd be runnin' the joint.

416
00:25:39,425 --> 00:25:40,778
Man, I hate lions.

417
00:25:40,865 --> 00:25:42,423
- So pushy.
- And hairy.

418
00:25:42,505 --> 00:25:44,541
- And stinky.
- And, man, are they...

419
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:46,536
Ugly!

420
00:25:48,745 --> 00:25:51,498
Surely we lions
are not all that bad.

421
00:25:52,705 --> 00:25:54,297
Oh, Scar. It's just you.

422
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:56,376
We were afraid it was
somebody important.

423
00:25:56,465 --> 00:25:57,818
Yeah, you know, like Mufasa.

424
00:25:57,905 --> 00:25:59,418
- Yeah.
- I see.

425
00:25:59,505 --> 00:26:01,621
- Now that's power!
- Tell me about it.

426
00:26:01,705 --> 00:26:03,855
I just hear that name and I shudder.

427
00:26:05,745 --> 00:26:07,736
Do it again.

428
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,657
It tingles me.

429
00:26:11,745 --> 00:26:14,498
I'm surrounded by idiots.

430
00:26:14,585 --> 00:26:17,577
Now, you, Scar, I mean, you're
one of us. I mean, you're our pal.

431
00:26:17,665 --> 00:26:18,734
Charmed.

432
00:26:18,825 --> 00:26:22,704
Oh, I like that. He's not king,
but he's still so proper.

433
00:26:22,785 --> 00:26:24,537
Hey, did you
bring us anything to eat,

434
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,775
Scar, old buddy, old pal? Did ya?

435
00:26:26,865 --> 00:26:29,095
I don't think
you really deserve this.

436
00:26:29,185 --> 00:26:32,143
I practically gift-wrapped
those cubs for you,

437
00:26:32,225 --> 00:26:35,501
and you couldn't even
dispose of them.

438
00:26:38,025 --> 00:26:39,140
Well, you know...

439
00:26:39,225 --> 00:26:41,944
it wasn't exactly like
they was alone, Scar.

440
00:26:42,025 --> 00:26:44,141
Yeah. What were we supposed to do?

441
00:26:44,225 --> 00:26:45,943
Kill Mufasa?

442
00:26:47,385 --> 00:26:49,455
Precisely.

443
00:26:59,545 --> 00:27:03,333
I know that your powers
of retention

444
00:27:03,425 --> 00:27:07,020
Are as wet
as a warthog's backside

445
00:27:07,105 --> 00:27:11,098
But thick as you are, pay attention

446
00:27:11,185 --> 00:27:14,780
My words are a matter of pride

447
00:27:14,865 --> 00:27:18,380
It's clear from
your vacant expressions

448
00:27:18,465 --> 00:27:22,219
The lights are not all on upstairs

449
00:27:22,305 --> 00:27:25,581
But we're talking kings
and successions

450
00:27:25,665 --> 00:27:28,304
Even you can't be caught unawares

451
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:33,061
So prepare for
the chance of a lifetime

452
00:27:33,145 --> 00:27:37,343
Be prepared for sensational news

453
00:27:37,425 --> 00:27:41,100
A shiny new era is tiptoeing nearer

454
00:27:41,185 --> 00:27:42,698
And where do we feature?

455
00:27:42,785 --> 00:27:44,901
Just listen to teacher

456
00:27:44,985 --> 00:27:46,782
I know it sounds sordid

457
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,662
But you'll be rewarded

458
00:27:48,745 --> 00:27:52,135
When at last I am given my dues

459
00:27:52,225 --> 00:27:55,615
And injustice deliciously squared

460
00:27:55,705 --> 00:27:58,777
Be prepared

461
00:27:58,865 --> 00:28:02,619
Yeah, be prepared.
We'll be prepared. For what?

462
00:28:02,705 --> 00:28:03,933
For the death of the king.

463
00:28:04,025 --> 00:28:06,539
- Why, is he sick?
- No, fool, we're going to kill him.

464
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:09,617
- And Simba, too.
- Great idea. Who needs a king?

465
00:28:09,705 --> 00:28:12,378
No king, no king

466
00:28:12,465 --> 00:28:15,423
- Idiots! There will be a king!
- But you said...

467
00:28:15,505 --> 00:28:17,416
I will be king!

468
00:28:17,505 --> 00:28:19,143
Stick with me,

469
00:28:19,225 --> 00:28:22,934
and you'll never go hungry again.

470
00:28:23,025 --> 00:28:25,255
- Yeah! All right!
- Long live the king!

471
00:28:25,345 --> 00:28:28,621
Long live the king!

472
00:28:30,425 --> 00:28:33,542
It's great that
we'll soon be connected

473
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:37,743
With a king who'll be
all-time adored

474
00:28:37,825 --> 00:28:41,181
Of course, quid pro quo,
you're expected

475
00:28:41,265 --> 00:28:45,099
To take certain duties on board

476
00:28:45,185 --> 00:28:48,780
The future is littered with prizes

477
00:28:48,865 --> 00:28:53,063
And though I'm the main addressee

478
00:28:53,145 --> 00:28:56,342
The point that I must emphasise is

479
00:28:56,425 --> 00:28:59,223
You won't get a sniff without me!

480
00:29:00,145 --> 00:29:03,581
So prepare for
the coup of the century

481
00:29:03,665 --> 00:29:07,817
Be prepared for the murkiest scam

482
00:29:07,905 --> 00:29:09,497
Meticulous planning

483
00:29:09,585 --> 00:29:11,416
Tenacity spanning

484
00:29:11,505 --> 00:29:13,496
Decades of denial

485
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:17,055
Is simply why
I'll be king undisputed

486
00:29:17,145 --> 00:29:19,022
Respected, saluted

487
00:29:19,105 --> 00:29:22,381
And seen for the wonder I am

488
00:29:22,465 --> 00:29:26,060
Yes, my teeth
and ambitions are bared

489
00:29:26,145 --> 00:29:30,297
Be prepared

490
00:29:30,385 --> 00:29:33,536
Yes, our teeth
and ambitions are bared

491
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:37,379
Be prepared

492
00:29:49,185 --> 00:29:53,656
You wait here. Your father has
a marvellous surprise for you.

493
00:29:53,745 --> 00:29:54,939
What is it?

494
00:29:55,025 --> 00:29:58,062
If I told you, it wouldn't be
a surprise now, would it?

495
00:29:58,145 --> 00:30:01,342
If you tell me,
I'll still act surprised.

496
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,814
You are such a naughty boy.

497
00:30:03,905 --> 00:30:06,942
- Come on, Uncle Scar.
- No, no, no, no, no.

498
00:30:07,025 --> 00:30:09,255
This is just for you
and your daddy.

499
00:30:09,345 --> 00:30:13,816
You know, a sort of
father-son... thing.

500
00:30:13,905 --> 00:30:16,578
Well, I'd better go get him.

501
00:30:16,665 --> 00:30:19,737
- I'll go with you.
- No.

502
00:30:19,825 --> 00:30:23,420
No. Just stay on this rock.

503
00:30:23,505 --> 00:30:25,416
You wouldn't want to end up
in another mess

504
00:30:25,505 --> 00:30:27,143
like you did with the hyenas.

505
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:30,934
- You know about that?
- Simba, everybody knows about that.

506
00:30:31,025 --> 00:30:33,493
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

507
00:30:33,585 --> 00:30:37,134
Lucky daddy was there
to save you, eh?

508
00:30:37,225 --> 00:30:39,819
Oh, and just between us,

509
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:43,341
you might want to work on
that little roar of yours.

510
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,744
OK.

511
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:51,094
Hey, Uncle Scar,
will I like this surprise?

512
00:30:51,185 --> 00:30:55,258
Simba, it's to die for.

513
00:31:15,465 --> 00:31:17,057
Shut up.

514
00:31:17,145 --> 00:31:20,421
I can't help it. I'm so hungry.
I got to have a wildebeest.

515
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:21,904
Stay put.

516
00:31:21,985 --> 00:31:24,101
Can't I just pick off
one of the little sick ones?

517
00:31:24,185 --> 00:31:27,973
No. We wait for the signal from Scar.

518
00:31:29,665 --> 00:31:33,214
There he is. Let's go.

519
00:31:33,305 --> 00:31:35,296
"Little roar"!

520
00:32:35,385 --> 00:32:37,262
Look, sire, the herd is on the move.

521
00:32:37,345 --> 00:32:39,575
- Odd.
- Mufasa, quick.

522
00:32:39,665 --> 00:32:41,337
Stampede in the gorge.

523
00:32:41,425 --> 00:32:44,019
Simba's down there.

524
00:33:05,225 --> 00:33:06,704
Zazu, help me!

525
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:08,741
Your father is on the way! Hold on!

526
00:33:08,825 --> 00:33:09,940
Hurry!

527
00:33:13,265 --> 00:33:15,859
There! There on that tree!

528
00:33:15,945 --> 00:33:17,094
Hold on, Simba!

529
00:33:23,865 --> 00:33:25,821
Oh, Scar, this is awful!

530
00:33:25,905 --> 00:33:28,339
What'll we do?

531
00:33:28,425 --> 00:33:30,461
I'll go back for help,
that's what I'll do.

532
00:34:04,465 --> 00:34:05,898
Dad!

533
00:34:27,905 --> 00:34:29,543
Scar!

534
00:34:30,825 --> 00:34:32,941
Brother! Help me!

535
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:44,055
Long live the king.

536
00:34:49,225 --> 00:34:50,817
No!

537
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,608
Dad!

538
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:59,322
Dad, come on.

539
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:02,163
You got to get up.

540
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:06,087
We got to go home.

541
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,327
Help!

542
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:23,045
Somebody!

543
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,722
Anybody.

544
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,365
Help.

545
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:00,719
Simba. What have you done?

546
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:04,962
There were wildebeests,
and he tried to save me.

547
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:08,167
It was an accident.
I didn't mean for it to happen.

548
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:12,289
Of course. Of course you didn't.

549
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:17,080
No one ever means for
these things to happen.

550
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:19,400
But the king is dead.

551
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:23,768
And if it weren't for you,
he'd still be alive.

552
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:32,122
What will your mother think?

553
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:35,839
- What am I going to do?
- Run away, Simba.

554
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:40,845
Run. Run away and never return.

555
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,689
Kill him.

556
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,327
Hey, there he goes.

557
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,241
So go get him.

558
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:45,286
There ain't no way
I'm going in there.

559
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:48,601
What, you want me to come out
looking like you, cactus butt?

560
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:50,924
But we got to finish the job.

561
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:53,922
Well, he's as good as
dead out there anyway.

562
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:56,160
And if he comes back, we'll kill him.

563
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,241
Yeah! You hear that?

564
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:01,879
If you ever come back,
we'll kill you!

565
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:14,042
Mufasa's death is a terrible tragedy.

566
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:18,282
But to lose Simba,
who had barely begun to live...

567
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,167
For me,

568
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:23,959
it is a deep, personal loss.

569
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:27,838
So it is with a heavy heart
that I assume the throne.

570
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:31,969
Yet out of the ashes of this tragedy
we shall rise

571
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,883
to greet the dawning of a new era

572
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:38,599
in which lion and hyena
come together

573
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:42,808
in a great and glorious future.

574
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:30,246
Get out of here!

575
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,560
I love this! Bowling for buzzards.

576
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:35,323
Gets 'em every time.

577
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:40,048
Hey, Timon, you better come look.

578
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:42,086
I think it's still alive.

579
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:46,567
All righty, what have we got here?

580
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:55,567
Jeez, it's a lion!
Run, Pumbaa, move it!

581
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:58,767
Hey, Timon, it's just a little lion.

582
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:03,241
Look at him.
He's so cute and all alone.

583
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,639
- Can we keep him?
- Pumbaa, are you nuts?

584
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:08,847
You're talking about a lion.
Lions eat guys like us.

585
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:11,285
- But he's so little.
- He's going to get bigger.

586
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:13,565
Maybe he'll be on our side.

587
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:15,242
That's the stupidest thing I ever
heard.

588
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:16,399
Maybe he'II...

589
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:19,687
Hey, I've got it.
What if he's on our side?

590
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:22,921
You know, having a lion around
might not be such a bad idea.

591
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:24,045
So we're keeping him?

592
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:26,280
Of course.
Who's the brains of this outfit?

593
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:27,929
My point exactly.

594
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:31,161
Jeez, I'm fried. Let's get out
of here and find some shade.

595
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:41,520
- You OK, kid?
- I guess so.

596
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:42,804
You nearly died.

597
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:43,879
I saved you.

598
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:46,609
Well, Pumbaa helped. A little.

599
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,442
Thanks for your help.

600
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:50,798
Hey, where you going?

601
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:53,006
Nowhere.

602
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:54,364
Gee, he looks blue.

603
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:58,523
- I'd say brownish gold.
- No. I mean he's depressed.

604
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,165
What's eating you?

605
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:03,127
Nothing. He's at the top
of the food chain.

606
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:07,929
The food chain!

607
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:13,242
So, where you from?

608
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,241
Who cares? I can't go back.

609
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:18,686
You're an outcast.
That's great. So are we.

610
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:21,000
- What'd you do, kid?
- Something terrible.

611
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:23,968
- But I don't want to talk about it.
- We don't want to hear about it.

612
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:26,120
Come on, Timon. Anything we can do?

613
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,724
Not unless you can change the past.

614
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:31,961
You know, kid, in times like this,
my buddy Timon here says

615
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,439
you got to put your
behind in your past.

616
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:36,248
No, no, no.

617
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:37,206
- I mean...
- Amateur.

618
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:39,929
Lie down before you hurt yourself.

619
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:42,604
It's you got to put
your past behind you.

620
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:46,319
Look, kid, bad things happen, and you
can't do anything about it, right?

621
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:47,604
- Right.
- Wrong!

622
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,204
When the world
turns its back on you,

623
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:52,884
you turn your back on the world.

624
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,767
Well, that's not what I was taught.

625
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:56,920
Then maybe you need a new lesson.

626
00:42:57,010 --> 00:43:00,480
Repeat after me: hakuna matata.

627
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:01,719
What?

628
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:05,159
It means "no worries".

629
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,083
Hakuna matata

630
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:11,207
What a wonderful phrase

631
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:13,520
Hakuna matata

632
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:16,807
Ain't no passing craze

633
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:19,085
It means no worries

634
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:23,083
For the rest of your days

635
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:27,925
It's our problem-free philosophy

636
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:30,399
Hakuna matata

637
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:32,208
Hakuna matata?

638
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:34,724
- Yeah. It's our motto.
- What's a motto?

639
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:36,766
Nothing. What's a motto with you?

640
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:41,809
Kid, these two words
will solve all your problems.

641
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:43,926
That's right.
Take Pumbaa, for example.

642
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:47,798
Why... when he was a young warthog

643
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:51,519
When I was a young warthog

644
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:53,441
- Very nice.
- Thanks.

645
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:56,283
He found his aroma
lacked a certain appeal

646
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:58,440
He could clear the savanna
after every meal

647
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:00,521
I'm a sensitive soul

648
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:02,999
Though I seem thick-skinned

649
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:09,119
And it hurt that my friends
never stood downwind

650
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:12,646
- And, oh, the shame
- He was ashamed

651
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:15,119
- Thought of changing my name
- Oh, what's in a name?

652
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:16,643
And I got downhearted

653
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:18,607
- How did you feel?
- Every time that I...

654
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:20,203
Pumbaa, not in front of the kids.

655
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,042
Oh, sorry.

656
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:24,201
Hakuna matata

657
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:27,407
What a wonderful phrase

658
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:29,208
Hakuna matata

659
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:32,362
Ain't no passing craze

660
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:34,566
It means no worries

661
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:36,447
For the rest of your days

662
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:38,122
Yeah, sing it, kid.

663
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:41,008
It's our problem-free

664
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:43,558
Philosophy

665
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:46,801
Hakuna matata

666
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:49,404
Welcome to our humble home.

667
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:51,958
- You live here?
- We live wherever we want.

668
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:54,359
Yep. Home is where your rump rests.

669
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:56,088
It's beautiful.

670
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:58,206
I'm starved.

671
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:01,441
I'm so hungry
I could eat a whole zebra.

672
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:03,168
We're fresh out of zebra.

673
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:04,888
Any antelope?

674
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:06,483
- Hippo?
- Nope.

675
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:09,562
Listen, kid, if you live with us,
you have to eat like us.

676
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:12,084
Hey, this looks like a good spot
to rustle up some grub.

677
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:14,564
Eugh, what's that?

678
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:16,368
A grub. What's it look like?

679
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:18,281
Gross.

680
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:20,838
Tastes like chicken.

681
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:24,398
Slimy yet satisfying.

682
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:27,050
These are rare delicacies.

683
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:30,923
Piquant, with a very pleasant crunch.

684
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:32,489
You'll learn to love them.

685
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:34,606
I'm telling you, kid,
this is the great life -

686
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:37,124
no rules, no responsibilities.

687
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:39,770
The little cream-filled kind.

688
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:42,284
And best of all, no worries.

689
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:44,326
Well, kid?

690
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:47,129
Oh, well. Hakuna matata.

691
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:54,244
Slimy, yet satisfying.

692
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:55,763
That's it.

693
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:08,805
Hakuna matata

694
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:10,209
Hakuna matata

695
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:12,008
Hakuna matata, hakuna

696
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:14,320
It means no worries

697
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:17,402
For the rest of your days

698
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:20,482
It's our problem-free

699
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:22,765
Philosophy

700
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:24,881
Hakuna matata

701
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:27,489
Hakuna matata

702
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:30,801
Hakuna matata

703
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:33,761
Hakuna matata

704
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:36,410
- Hakuna matata
- Ooh ooh ooh

705
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:38,082
Hakuna matata

706
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,683
Brrrrrr!

707
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:43,683
Hakuna matata

708
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:47,319
Hakuna matata

709
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:48,923
Yeah

710
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:50,523
Ta-ta!

711
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:52,487
Ha ha ha!

712
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:01,121
Nobody knows

713
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:04,520
The trouble I've seen

714
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:08,285
Nobody knows

715
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:10,088
My sorrow

716
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:12,161
Oh, Zazu, do lighten up.

717
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:15,287
Sing something with
a little bounce in it.

718
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:19,039
It's a small world after all

719
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:22,202
No, no! Anything but that.

720
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:27,325
I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts

721
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:29,799
There they are a-standing in a row

722
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:33,722
Big ones, small ones,
some as big as your head

723
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:36,608
I would never have had
to do this with Mufasa.

724
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,646
What? What did you say?

725
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,846
- Nothing.
- You know the law.

726
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:45,162
Never ever mention that name
in my presence. I am the king!

727
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:47,639
Yes, sire, you are the king.

728
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:50,642
I... only mentioned it
to illustrate the differences

729
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:53,039
in your royal managerial approaches.

730
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:56,247
- Hey, boss.
- Oh, what is it this time?

731
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:58,480
- We got a bone to pick with you.
- I'll handle this.

732
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:00,925
Scar, there's no food, no water.

733
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:04,764
Yeah. It's dinnertime,
and we ain't got no stinking entrées.

734
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:09,082
It's the lionesses' job
to do the hunting.

735
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:11,968
- Yeah, but they won't go hunt.
- Oh, eat Zazu.

736
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:14,086
Oh, you wouldn't want me.

737
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:16,843
I'd be so tough and gamy and...

738
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:20,240
Oh, Zazu, don't be ridiculous.
All you need is a little garlic.

739
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,241
I thought things
were bad under Mufasa.

740
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:23,888
- What did you say?
- I said Muf...

741
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:26,359
I said... Qué pasa?

742
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:28,725
Good. Now get out.

743
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:31,762
But we're still hungry.

744
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:33,727
Out!

745
00:48:41,607 --> 00:48:43,802
- Nice one, Simba.
- Thanks.

746
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:46,720
- Man, I'm stuffed.
- Me, too.

747
00:48:46,807 --> 00:48:48,923
I ate like a pig.

748
00:48:49,007 --> 00:48:50,998
Pumbaa, you are a pig.

749
00:48:51,087 --> 00:48:52,998
Oh. Right.

750
00:49:03,567 --> 00:49:06,240
- Timon?
- Yeah?

751
00:49:06,327 --> 00:49:10,320
Ever wonder what those
sparkling dots are up there?

752
00:49:10,407 --> 00:49:13,240
Pumbaa, I don't wonder, I know.

753
00:49:13,327 --> 00:49:16,319
Oh? What are they?

754
00:49:16,407 --> 00:49:17,886
They're fireflies.

755
00:49:17,967 --> 00:49:22,438
Fireflies that got stuck
up in that big blueish-black thing.

756
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:24,442
Gee.

757
00:49:24,527 --> 00:49:27,325
I always thought
they were balls of gas

758
00:49:27,407 --> 00:49:31,002
burning billions of miles away.

759
00:49:31,087 --> 00:49:34,523
Pumbaa, with you, everything's gas.

760
00:49:34,607 --> 00:49:36,518
Simba, what do you think?

761
00:49:36,607 --> 00:49:38,518
Well, I don't know.

762
00:49:38,607 --> 00:49:40,563
Oh, come on. Give.

763
00:49:40,647 --> 00:49:43,525
Come on. We told you ours. Please?

764
00:49:43,607 --> 00:49:44,960
Well...

765
00:49:45,047 --> 00:49:47,561
somebody once told me

766
00:49:47,647 --> 00:49:52,004
that the great kings of the past
are up there watching over us.

767
00:49:52,087 --> 00:49:52,917
Really?

768
00:49:53,007 --> 00:49:56,204
You mean a bunch of royal dead guys
are watching us?

769
00:50:01,527 --> 00:50:04,280
Who told you something like that?

770
00:50:04,367 --> 00:50:08,918
- What mook made that up?
- Yeah, pretty dumb, huh?

771
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:10,998
You're killing me.

772
00:50:21,167 --> 00:50:23,522
Was it something I said?

773
00:51:15,767 --> 00:51:17,883
He's alive?

774
00:51:32,807 --> 00:51:34,240
It is time.

775
00:51:43,087 --> 00:51:46,841
In the jungle, the mighty jungle

776
00:51:46,927 --> 00:51:50,920
The lion sleeps tonight

777
00:51:56,687 --> 00:51:58,996
I can't hear you, buddy. Back me up.

778
00:52:06,007 --> 00:52:08,077
Pumbaa?

779
00:52:23,087 --> 00:52:25,043
Timon?

780
00:52:55,327 --> 00:52:58,125
- Hey, what's going on?
- She's going to eat me!

781
00:53:01,207 --> 00:53:04,040
Jeez, why do I always
have to save your...

782
00:53:10,247 --> 00:53:12,522
Don't worry, buddy.
I'm here for you.

783
00:53:12,607 --> 00:53:14,120
Everything's going to be OK.

784
00:53:14,207 --> 00:53:17,279
Get her! Bite her head!

785
00:53:17,367 --> 00:53:20,086
Go for the jugular! The jugular!

786
00:53:20,167 --> 00:53:23,045
See, I told you he'd come in handy.

787
00:53:26,447 --> 00:53:28,005
Nala?

788
00:53:31,327 --> 00:53:33,124
Is it really you?

789
00:53:33,207 --> 00:53:36,836
- Who are you?
- It's me. Simba.

790
00:53:43,727 --> 00:53:45,763
How did you...?

791
00:53:46,567 --> 00:53:48,637
Where did you come from?

792
00:53:48,727 --> 00:53:50,399
It's great to see you!

793
00:53:50,487 --> 00:53:52,955
- What's goin' on here?
- What are you doing here?

794
00:53:53,047 --> 00:53:55,277
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

795
00:53:55,367 --> 00:53:57,722
Hey! What's goin' on here?!

796
00:53:57,807 --> 00:54:00,719
Timon, this is Nala.
She's my best friend.

797
00:54:00,807 --> 00:54:04,561
- Friend?
- Yeah. Hey, Pumbaa, come over here.

798
00:54:05,847 --> 00:54:08,077
Nala, this is Pumbaa. Pumbaa, Nala.

799
00:54:08,167 --> 00:54:10,727
- Pleased to meet you.
- The pleasure is all mine.

800
00:54:10,807 --> 00:54:14,766
How do you do? Time out!
Let me get this straight.

801
00:54:14,847 --> 00:54:16,678
You know her, she knows you.

802
00:54:16,767 --> 00:54:21,204
But she wants to eat him,
and everybody's OK with this?

803
00:54:21,287 --> 00:54:23,801
- Did I miss something?!
- Relax, Timon.

804
00:54:23,887 --> 00:54:26,685
Wait till everyone finds out
you've been here all this time.

805
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:30,123
And your mother -
what will she think?

806
00:54:30,207 --> 00:54:33,438
She doesn't have to know.
Nobody has to know.

807
00:54:33,527 --> 00:54:35,677
Of course they do.
Everyone thinks you're dead.

808
00:54:35,767 --> 00:54:36,882
They do?

809
00:54:36,967 --> 00:54:40,039
Yeah. Scar told us
about the stampede.

810
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:43,483
He did? What else did he tell you?

811
00:54:43,567 --> 00:54:48,687
What else matters? You're alive.
And that means... you're the king.

812
00:54:48,767 --> 00:54:53,795
King? Lady, have you got
your lions crossed.

813
00:54:53,887 --> 00:54:55,002
King?

814
00:54:55,087 --> 00:54:59,080
Your Majesty, I gravel at your feet.

815
00:54:59,167 --> 00:55:01,886
- Stop it.
- It's not gravel, it's grovel.

816
00:55:01,967 --> 00:55:05,357
And don't! He's not the king.
Are you?

817
00:55:05,447 --> 00:55:06,926
- No.
- Simba!

818
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:09,396
No, I'm not the king.
Maybe I was gonna be,

819
00:55:09,487 --> 00:55:11,682
but that was a long time ago.

820
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:15,362
Let me get this straight. You're
the king? And you never told us?

821
00:55:15,447 --> 00:55:18,086
- Look, I'm still the same guy.
- But with power.

822
00:55:18,167 --> 00:55:20,920
Could you guys excuse us
for a few minutes?

823
00:55:21,007 --> 00:55:22,804
Whatever she has to say,

824
00:55:22,887 --> 00:55:24,957
she can say in front of us,
right, Simba?

825
00:55:27,247 --> 00:55:29,602
Maybe you'd better go.

826
00:55:29,687 --> 00:55:32,759
It starts.
You think you know a guy...

827
00:55:36,047 --> 00:55:37,526
Timon and Pumbaa -

828
00:55:37,607 --> 00:55:39,325
you learn to love 'em.

829
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:45,526
What? What is it?

830
00:55:45,607 --> 00:55:48,917
It's like you're back from the dead.

831
00:55:49,007 --> 00:55:52,795
You don't know how much
this will mean to everyone.

832
00:55:52,887 --> 00:55:54,684
What it means to me.

833
00:55:54,767 --> 00:55:58,396
- Hey, it's OK.
- I've really missed you.

834
00:55:58,487 --> 00:56:01,001
I've missed you, too.

835
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:06,080
I tell you, Pumbaa. This stinks.

836
00:56:06,167 --> 00:56:07,805
Oh, sorry.

837
00:56:07,887 --> 00:56:09,957
Not you! Them!

838
00:56:10,047 --> 00:56:13,562
Him, her, alone.

839
00:56:13,647 --> 00:56:15,046
What's wrong with that?

840
00:56:15,127 --> 00:56:17,561
- I can see what's happening
- What?

841
00:56:17,647 --> 00:56:20,115
- And they don't have a clue
- Who?

842
00:56:20,207 --> 00:56:23,358
They'll fall in love
and here's the bottom line

843
00:56:23,447 --> 00:56:26,200
Our trio's down to two

844
00:56:26,287 --> 00:56:29,199
The sweet caress of twilight

845
00:56:29,287 --> 00:56:32,120
There's magic everywhere

846
00:56:32,207 --> 00:56:37,486
And with all this
romantic atmosphere

847
00:56:37,567 --> 00:56:41,196
Disaster's in the air

848
00:56:46,287 --> 00:56:52,522
Can you feel the love tonight?

849
00:56:52,607 --> 00:56:57,886
The peace the evening brings

850
00:56:57,967 --> 00:57:00,925
The world, for once

851
00:57:01,007 --> 00:57:04,044
In perfect harmony

852
00:57:04,127 --> 00:57:09,155
With all its living things

853
00:57:10,607 --> 00:57:13,075
So many things to tell her

854
00:57:13,167 --> 00:57:16,159
But how to make her see

855
00:57:16,247 --> 00:57:18,715
The truth about my past...

856
00:57:18,807 --> 00:57:22,277
Impossible, she'd turn away from me

857
00:57:22,367 --> 00:57:25,325
He's holding back, he's hiding

858
00:57:25,407 --> 00:57:28,604
But what, I can't decide

859
00:57:28,687 --> 00:57:31,838
Why won't he be
the king I know he is?

860
00:57:31,927 --> 00:57:35,556
The king I see inside?

861
00:57:36,487 --> 00:57:42,039
Can you feel the love tonight?

862
00:57:42,127 --> 00:57:46,996
The peace the evening brings

863
00:57:48,367 --> 00:57:51,040
The world, for once

864
00:57:51,127 --> 00:57:54,119
In perfect harmony

865
00:57:54,207 --> 00:57:59,759
With all its living things

866
00:58:00,887 --> 00:58:07,201
Can you feel the love tonight?

867
00:58:07,287 --> 00:58:11,917
You needn't look too far

868
00:58:13,247 --> 00:58:15,477
Stealing through

869
00:58:15,567 --> 00:58:18,684
The night's uncertainties

870
00:58:18,767 --> 00:58:23,443
Love is where they are

871
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:30,319
And if he falls in love tonight

872
00:58:31,687 --> 00:58:37,284
It can be assumed

873
00:58:37,367 --> 00:58:39,835
His carefree days

874
00:58:39,927 --> 00:58:43,158
With us are history

875
00:58:43,247 --> 00:58:47,126
In short, our pal

876
00:58:47,207 --> 00:58:54,636
Is doomed

877
00:59:00,687 --> 00:59:02,678
Isn't this a great place?

878
00:59:02,767 --> 00:59:04,678
It is beautiful.

879
00:59:04,767 --> 00:59:07,520
But I don't understand something.

880
00:59:07,607 --> 00:59:09,882
You've been alive all this time.

881
00:59:09,967 --> 00:59:12,197
Why didn't you come
back to Pride Rock?

882
00:59:12,287 --> 00:59:16,758
Well, I just needed to get out
on my own, live my own life.

883
00:59:16,847 --> 00:59:18,644
And I did, and it's great.

884
00:59:18,727 --> 00:59:20,718
We've really needed you at home.

885
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:24,846
- No one needs me.
- Yes, we do. You're the king.

886
00:59:24,927 --> 00:59:27,885
Nala, we've been through this.
I'm not the king. Scar is.

887
00:59:28,807 --> 00:59:31,640
Simba, he let the hyenas
take over the pride lands.

888
00:59:31,727 --> 00:59:33,638
- What?
- Everything's destroyed.

889
00:59:33,727 --> 00:59:35,319
There's no food, no water.

890
00:59:35,407 --> 00:59:37,967
If you don't do something
soon, everyone will starve.

891
00:59:38,047 --> 00:59:39,275
- I can't go back.
- Why?

892
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:41,437
- You wouldn't understand.
- What?

893
00:59:41,527 --> 00:59:44,087
No, no, no. It doesn't matter.
Hakuna matata.

894
00:59:44,167 --> 00:59:45,805
- What?
- Hakuna matata.

895
00:59:45,887 --> 00:59:50,278
It's something I learned out here.
Sometimes bad things happen

896
00:59:50,367 --> 00:59:53,643
and there's nothing you can do
about it. So why worry?

897
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:58,039
- Because it's your responsibility.
- Well, what about you? You left.

898
00:59:58,127 --> 01:00:00,880
I left to find help, and I found you.

899
01:00:00,967 --> 01:00:05,245
Don't you understand?
You're our only hope.

900
01:00:05,327 --> 01:00:08,046
- Sorry.
- What's happened to you?

901
01:00:08,127 --> 01:00:11,881
- You're not the Simba I remember.
- You're right. I'm not.

902
01:00:11,967 --> 01:00:15,323
- Now are you satisfied?
- No. Just disappointed.

903
01:00:15,407 --> 01:00:18,205
You know, you're starting
to sound like my father.

904
01:00:18,287 --> 01:00:20,164
Good. At least one of us does.

905
01:00:21,287 --> 01:00:24,359
You think you can just show
up and tell me how to live my life?

906
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:26,403
You don't even know
what I've been through.

907
01:00:26,487 --> 01:00:28,045
I would if you'd just tell me.

908
01:00:28,127 --> 01:00:29,879
- Forget it!
- Fine!

909
01:00:32,927 --> 01:00:35,999
She's wrong. I can't go back.

910
01:00:36,087 --> 01:00:39,636
What would it prove, anyway?
It won't change anything.

911
01:00:39,727 --> 01:00:41,957
You can't change the past.

912
01:00:44,687 --> 01:00:47,918
You said you'd always
be there for me!

913
01:00:48,007 --> 01:00:49,998
But you're not.

914
01:00:51,927 --> 01:00:54,361
And it's because of me.

915
01:00:54,447 --> 01:00:57,359
It's my fault.

916
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:05,204
Asante sana, squash banana

917
01:01:42,687 --> 01:01:44,200
Come on, will you cut it out?

918
01:01:44,287 --> 01:01:47,085
Can't cut it out.
It'll grow right back.

919
01:01:47,167 --> 01:01:50,125
Creepy little monkey.
Will you stop following me?

920
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:53,677
- Who are you?
- The question is, who... are you?

921
01:01:56,007 --> 01:01:59,682
I thought I knew.
Now I'm not so sure.

922
01:01:59,767 --> 01:02:03,237
Well, I know who you are.
Come here. It's a secret.

923
01:02:04,247 --> 01:02:07,239
Asante sana, squash banana

924
01:02:07,327 --> 01:02:09,283
What is that
supposed to mean, anyway?

925
01:02:09,367 --> 01:02:12,518
It means you are a baboon,
and I'm not.

926
01:02:14,247 --> 01:02:16,397
I think you're a little confused.

927
01:02:16,487 --> 01:02:19,240
Wrong!
I'm not the one who's confused.

928
01:02:19,327 --> 01:02:22,637
- You don't even know who you are.
- Oh, and I suppose you know.

929
01:02:22,727 --> 01:02:24,957
Sure do. You're Mufasa's boy.

930
01:02:27,047 --> 01:02:29,561
- Bye.
- Hey, wait!

931
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:39,281
You knew my father?

932
01:02:39,367 --> 01:02:42,404
Correction - I know your father.

933
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:46,277
I hate to tell you this,

934
01:02:46,367 --> 01:02:49,359
but he died... a long time ago.

935
01:02:49,447 --> 01:02:51,403
Nope. Wrong again!

936
01:02:52,847 --> 01:02:55,566
He's alive, and I'll show him to you.

937
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:58,320
You follow old Rafiki.
He knows the way. Come on!

938
01:03:07,687 --> 01:03:09,917
Don't dawdle. Hurry up!

939
01:03:10,567 --> 01:03:13,127
- Wait.
- Come on.

940
01:03:15,207 --> 01:03:16,925
Would you slow down?

941
01:03:27,927 --> 01:03:29,076
Stop!

942
01:03:34,127 --> 01:03:35,924
Look down there.

943
01:03:59,607 --> 01:04:02,838
That's not my father.
That's just my reflection.

944
01:04:02,927 --> 01:04:03,837
No.

945
01:04:05,407 --> 01:04:08,126
Look harder.

946
01:04:14,367 --> 01:04:15,516
You see?

947
01:04:16,847 --> 01:04:19,236
He lives in you.

948
01:04:25,847 --> 01:04:27,405
Father?

949
01:04:35,047 --> 01:04:37,641
Simba, you have forgotten me.

950
01:04:37,727 --> 01:04:39,763
No. How could I?

951
01:04:39,847 --> 01:04:44,398
You have forgotten who you are,
and so have forgotten me.

952
01:04:44,487 --> 01:04:46,637
Look inside yourself, Simba.

953
01:04:46,727 --> 01:04:50,640
You are more than
what you have become.

954
01:04:50,727 --> 01:04:53,924
You must take your place
in the circle of life.

955
01:04:54,007 --> 01:04:57,761
How can I go back?
I'm not who I used to be.

956
01:04:57,847 --> 01:05:01,522
Remember who you are.

957
01:05:01,607 --> 01:05:05,361
You are my son
and the one true king.

958
01:05:07,167 --> 01:05:10,682
Remember who you are.

959
01:05:10,767 --> 01:05:13,327
No! Please, don't leave me!

960
01:05:13,407 --> 01:05:14,760
Remember.

961
01:05:14,847 --> 01:05:16,246
Father!

962
01:05:16,327 --> 01:05:18,204
Don't leave me.

963
01:05:28,127 --> 01:05:30,322
What was that?

964
01:05:30,407 --> 01:05:32,045
The weather.

965
01:05:32,127 --> 01:05:35,642
- Very peculiar, don't you think?
- Yeah.

966
01:05:36,447 --> 01:05:38,802
Looks like the winds are changing.

967
01:05:38,887 --> 01:05:40,161
Change is good.

968
01:05:40,247 --> 01:05:42,317
Yeah, but it's not easy.

969
01:05:42,407 --> 01:05:47,197
I know what I have to do but going
back means I'll have to face my past.

970
01:05:47,287 --> 01:05:50,199
I've been running from it
for so long.

971
01:05:52,007 --> 01:05:53,520
What was that for?

972
01:05:53,607 --> 01:05:56,201
It doesn't matter. It's in the past.

973
01:05:56,287 --> 01:05:58,198
Yeah, but it still hurts.

974
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:00,482
Oh, yes, the past can hurt.

975
01:06:00,567 --> 01:06:04,003
But the way I see it
you can either run from it

976
01:06:04,087 --> 01:06:06,806
or... learn from it.

977
01:06:06,887 --> 01:06:09,560
You see?
So what are you going to do?

978
01:06:09,647 --> 01:06:12,115
First, I'm gonna take your stick.

979
01:06:12,207 --> 01:06:14,357
No! Not the stick!

980
01:06:15,647 --> 01:06:18,320
- Where are you going?
- I'm going back!

981
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:20,682
Good! Go on! Get out of here!

982
01:06:36,807 --> 01:06:38,126
Grubs!

983
01:06:44,207 --> 01:06:45,686
Hey, wake up.

984
01:06:49,127 --> 01:06:52,324
It's OK! It's OK! It's me!

985
01:06:53,447 --> 01:06:55,802
Don't ever do that again.

986
01:06:55,887 --> 01:06:57,718
Carnivores!

987
01:06:57,807 --> 01:07:00,275
- Have you guys seen Simba?
- I thought he was with you.

988
01:07:00,367 --> 01:07:02,961
He was, but now I can't find him.
Where is he?

989
01:07:03,047 --> 01:07:05,038
You won't find him here!

990
01:07:06,047 --> 01:07:08,163
The king has returned.

991
01:07:08,247 --> 01:07:11,284
I can't believe it. He's gone back!

992
01:07:11,367 --> 01:07:13,119
Gone back? What do you mean?

993
01:07:13,207 --> 01:07:16,005
Hey, what's goin' on here?

994
01:07:16,087 --> 01:07:18,555
- Who's the monkey?
- Simba's gone to challenge Scar.

995
01:07:18,647 --> 01:07:19,477
- Who?
- Scar.

996
01:07:19,567 --> 01:07:21,319
- Who's got a scar?
- No, it's his uncle.

997
01:07:21,407 --> 01:07:23,602
- The monkey's his uncle?
- No! Simba's gone back

998
01:07:23,687 --> 01:07:27,202
to challenge his uncle,
to take his place as king.

999
01:08:22,887 --> 01:08:24,684
Simba, wait up!

1000
01:08:28,047 --> 01:08:32,165
- It's awful, isn't it?
- I didn't want to believe you.

1001
01:08:32,247 --> 01:08:34,203
What made you come back?

1002
01:08:34,287 --> 01:08:37,085
I finally got some sense
knocked into me,

1003
01:08:37,167 --> 01:08:39,362
and I've got the bump to prove it.

1004
01:08:39,447 --> 01:08:41,722
Besides, this is my kingdom.

1005
01:08:41,807 --> 01:08:45,004
If I don't fight for it, who will?

1006
01:08:45,087 --> 01:08:47,920
- I will.
- It's gonna be dangerous.

1007
01:08:48,007 --> 01:08:52,285
Danger?
I laugh in the face of danger.

1008
01:08:52,367 --> 01:08:54,085
I see nothing funny about this.

1009
01:08:54,167 --> 01:08:57,045
Timon, Pumbaa,
what are you doing here?

1010
01:08:57,127 --> 01:08:59,197
At your service, my liege.

1011
01:08:59,287 --> 01:09:02,757
We're gonna fight your uncle...
for this?

1012
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:06,044
Yes, Timon. This is my home.

1013
01:09:07,007 --> 01:09:08,679
Talk about your fixer-upper.

1014
01:09:08,767 --> 01:09:13,045
Well, Simba, if it's important to
you, we're with you to the end.

1015
01:09:30,887 --> 01:09:35,438
- Hyenas. I hate hyenas.
- So what's your plan

1016
01:09:35,527 --> 01:09:37,245
for getting past those guys?

1017
01:09:37,327 --> 01:09:39,966
- Live bait.
- Good idea.

1018
01:09:40,647 --> 01:09:43,320
Come on, Timon. You guys
have to create a diversion.

1019
01:09:43,407 --> 01:09:45,921
Do you want me to
dress in drag and do the hula?

1020
01:09:48,047 --> 01:09:49,685
If you're hungry for juicy meat

1021
01:09:49,767 --> 01:09:51,439
Eat Pumbaa because he is a treat

1022
01:09:51,527 --> 01:09:53,404
Come on down and dine
on this tasty swine

1023
01:09:53,487 --> 01:09:54,840
All you have to do is get in line

1024
01:09:54,927 --> 01:09:57,236
Are you achin'

1025
01:09:57,327 --> 01:09:59,318
For some bacon?

1026
01:09:59,407 --> 01:10:00,840
He's a big pig

1027
01:10:00,927 --> 01:10:02,724
You could be a big pig, too!

1028
01:10:07,647 --> 01:10:10,798
Nala, you find my mother
and rally the lionesses.

1029
01:10:10,887 --> 01:10:12,878
I'll look for Scar.

1030
01:10:16,007 --> 01:10:17,645
Sarabi!

1031
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:32,876
Yes, Scar?

1032
01:10:32,967 --> 01:10:36,277
Where is your hunting party?
They're not doing their job.

1033
01:10:36,367 --> 01:10:39,120
Scar, there is no food.
The herds have moved on.

1034
01:10:39,207 --> 01:10:41,767
No, you're just not
looking hard enough.

1035
01:10:41,847 --> 01:10:45,681
It's over. There is nothing left.

1036
01:10:45,767 --> 01:10:49,476
We have only one choice.
We must leave Pride Rock.

1037
01:10:49,567 --> 01:10:52,877
- We're not going anywhere.
- You have sentenced us to death.

1038
01:10:52,967 --> 01:10:55,003
- Then so be it.
- You can't do that.

1039
01:10:55,087 --> 01:10:57,282
I am the king.
I can do whatever I want.

1040
01:10:57,367 --> 01:10:59,676
If you were half
the king Mufasa was...

1041
01:10:59,767 --> 01:11:02,235
I'm ten times the king Mufasa was!

1042
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:07,436
Mufasa? No, you're dead.

1043
01:11:14,127 --> 01:11:16,118
Mufasa?

1044
01:11:17,367 --> 01:11:19,323
No. It's me.

1045
01:11:20,007 --> 01:11:24,762
Simba! You're alive?
How can that be?

1046
01:11:24,847 --> 01:11:28,476
It doesn't matter. I'm home.

1047
01:11:32,007 --> 01:11:34,316
I'm a little surprised to see you...

1048
01:11:34,407 --> 01:11:35,806
alive.

1049
01:11:37,367 --> 01:11:40,757
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't rip you apart.

1050
01:11:40,847 --> 01:11:42,724
Oh, Simba, you must understand.

1051
01:11:42,807 --> 01:11:45,082
The pressures of ruling a kingdom...

1052
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:48,318
Are no longer yours. Step down, Scar.

1053
01:11:48,407 --> 01:11:50,716
Oh, well, I would, naturally.

1054
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:53,605
However, there is one little problem.

1055
01:11:53,687 --> 01:11:55,484
You see them?

1056
01:11:57,047 --> 01:11:59,242
They think I'm king.

1057
01:11:59,327 --> 01:12:02,922
Well, we don't.
Simba's the rightful king.

1058
01:12:03,007 --> 01:12:04,838
The choice is yours, Scar.

1059
01:12:04,927 --> 01:12:07,202
Either step down or fight.

1060
01:12:07,287 --> 01:12:09,721
Oh, must this all end in violence?

1061
01:12:09,807 --> 01:12:13,925
I'd hate to be responsible
for the death of a family member.

1062
01:12:14,007 --> 01:12:17,124
- Wouldn't you agree, Simba?
- That's not gonna work, Scar.

1063
01:12:17,207 --> 01:12:18,526
I've put it behind me.

1064
01:12:18,607 --> 01:12:20,438
But what about
your faithful subjects?

1065
01:12:20,527 --> 01:12:22,324
Have they put it behind them?

1066
01:12:22,407 --> 01:12:24,398
Simba, what is he talking about?

1067
01:12:25,727 --> 01:12:28,639
So you haven't told them
your little secret.

1068
01:12:28,727 --> 01:12:31,958
Well, Simba,
now's your chance to tell them.

1069
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:36,677
Tell them who is responsible
for Mufasa's death.

1070
01:12:38,967 --> 01:12:41,003
I am.

1071
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:46,721
It's not true.

1072
01:12:46,807 --> 01:12:49,241
Tell me it's not true.

1073
01:12:50,647 --> 01:12:53,878
- It's true.
- You see? He admits it!

1074
01:12:53,967 --> 01:12:56,845
- Murderer!
- No! It was an accident.

1075
01:12:56,927 --> 01:13:00,476
If it weren't for you, Mufasa would
be alive. It's your fault he's dead!

1076
01:13:00,567 --> 01:13:02,000
- Do you deny it?
- No.

1077
01:13:02,087 --> 01:13:06,205
- Then you're guilty.
- No, I'm not a murderer!

1078
01:13:06,287 --> 01:13:08,323
Oh, Simba, you're in trouble again,

1079
01:13:08,407 --> 01:13:11,285
but this time
daddy isn't here to save you,

1080
01:13:11,367 --> 01:13:14,439
and now everyone knows why!

1081
01:13:22,087 --> 01:13:25,477
Now, this looks familiar.

1082
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:29,644
Where have I seen this before?
Let me think.

1083
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:32,961
Oh, yes. I remember.

1084
01:13:33,047 --> 01:13:36,722
This is just the way
your father looked before he died.

1085
01:13:38,807 --> 01:13:42,402
And here's my little secret.

1086
01:13:42,487 --> 01:13:45,445
I killed Mufasa.

1087
01:13:49,207 --> 01:13:50,879
Murderer!

1088
01:13:50,967 --> 01:13:53,322
- No, Simba, please.
- Tell them the truth.

1089
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:56,956
Truth? But truth is in
the eye of the behold...

1090
01:13:57,727 --> 01:13:59,160
All right.

1091
01:13:59,247 --> 01:14:01,522
All right!

1092
01:14:01,607 --> 01:14:03,040
I did it.

1093
01:14:03,127 --> 01:14:05,118
So they can hear you.

1094
01:14:06,047 --> 01:14:08,925
I killed Mufasa!

1095
01:14:21,167 --> 01:14:23,840
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Comin' through. Hot stuff.

1096
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:54,196
- Let me out!
- Let me in!

1097
01:14:55,287 --> 01:14:57,847
Please, don't eat me.

1098
01:14:57,927 --> 01:14:59,360
Drop 'em!

1099
01:14:59,447 --> 01:15:01,677
- Hey, who's the pig?
- Are you talkin' to me?

1100
01:15:01,767 --> 01:15:03,723
- He called him a pig!
- Are you talking to me?

1101
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:06,605
- Shouldn't have done that.
- Are you talking to me?!

1102
01:15:06,687 --> 01:15:11,078
They call me... Mr Pig!

1103
01:15:14,767 --> 01:15:16,758
Take that, you stupid...

1104
01:15:16,847 --> 01:15:18,758
Take that and that!

1105
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:24,161
Run, you yellow-belly!

1106
01:15:43,447 --> 01:15:46,166
- Murderer.
- Simba, please.

1107
01:15:46,247 --> 01:15:49,956
- Please, have mercy. I beg you.
- You don't deserve to live.

1108
01:15:50,047 --> 01:15:55,246
But, Simba, I am... family.

1109
01:15:55,327 --> 01:15:58,444
It's the hyenas
who are the real enemy.

1110
01:15:58,527 --> 01:16:01,121
It was their fault.
It was their idea.

1111
01:16:01,207 --> 01:16:03,243
Why should I believe you?

1112
01:16:03,327 --> 01:16:06,285
Everything you ever
told me was a lie.

1113
01:16:06,367 --> 01:16:08,198
What are you going to do?

1114
01:16:08,287 --> 01:16:11,723
You wouldn't kill your own uncle.

1115
01:16:11,807 --> 01:16:14,116
No, Scar.

1116
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:16,004
I'm not like you.

1117
01:16:16,087 --> 01:16:19,159
Oh, Simba, thank you.
You are truly noble.

1118
01:16:19,247 --> 01:16:22,876
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
And how can I prove myself to you?

1119
01:16:22,967 --> 01:16:24,525
Tell me. I mean, anything.

1120
01:16:25,167 --> 01:16:26,680
Run.

1121
01:16:26,767 --> 01:16:28,598
Run away, Scar,

1122
01:16:28,687 --> 01:16:30,757
and never return.

1123
01:16:32,047 --> 01:16:33,605
Yes.

1124
01:16:33,687 --> 01:16:35,757
Of course.

1125
01:16:35,847 --> 01:16:38,407
As you wish...

1126
01:16:38,487 --> 01:16:40,443
Your Majesty!

1127
01:17:32,487 --> 01:17:34,717
My friends.

1128
01:17:34,807 --> 01:17:38,277
Friends? I thought he said
we were the enemy.

1129
01:17:38,367 --> 01:17:41,325
Yeah. That's what I heard.

1130
01:17:41,407 --> 01:17:42,681
Ed?

1131
01:17:46,607 --> 01:17:50,964
No. Let me explain.
No, you don't understand!

1132
01:17:51,047 --> 01:17:53,356
No, I didn't mean... No!

1133
01:18:57,087 --> 01:18:58,679
It is time.

1134
01:19:22,567 --> 01:19:24,558
Remember.

1135
01:20:05,487 --> 01:20:10,117
Till we find our place

1136
01:20:10,207 --> 01:20:14,803
On the path unwinding

1137
01:20:16,167 --> 01:20:20,922
In the circle

1138
01:20:21,007 --> 01:20:25,956
The circle of life

1139
01:20:26,047 --> 01:20:27,685
Circle of

1140
01:20:27,767 --> 01:20:29,885
Life
