1
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:22,650
Whoa.

2
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:49,635
Coigne?

3
00:02:53,523 --> 00:02:55,266
Whoa.

4
00:03:02,407 --> 00:03:04,233
Hey, Leland!

5
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,082
Who's gonna unpack this mule?
I'm tired as hell!

6
00:03:27,557 --> 00:03:29,341
Damn.

7
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:47,603
"Leland Drum.

8
00:03:47,703 --> 00:03:50,230
A good friend shot dead...

9
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,940
by I don't know what...

10
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,944
and buried in this spot by Coley
Boyard, his good friend...

11
00:03:56,044 --> 00:03:57,828
in April."

12
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,991
Coley!

13
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:25,105
Who is that down there?

14
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,477
Willett!

15
00:04:28,577 --> 00:04:30,361
That you, Coley?

16
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,273
Willett who?

17
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,275
Gashade! Gashade!

18
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,277
What's the matter with you?

19
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:40,829
You step out so's I can
see you, if it's you.

20
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:50,207
You look! That over there's the pack
mule, and that's Frazer, ain't it?

21
00:04:50,307 --> 00:04:52,508
Well, so who could I be?

22
00:04:53,935 --> 00:04:56,463
- Willett?
- He's crazy.

23
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,555
That's right! It's me!

24
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,100
Hi, Will!

25
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,599
Been sittin' up in the
mine for two days.

26
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:09,434
Spooked near crazy.

27
00:05:09,534 --> 00:05:12,145
Would've shot anything
on two legs moving, Will.

28
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,523
'Ceptin' you. If I knowed it
was you, I sure wouldn't have...

29
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,733
Never mind. Just tell me
what you're telling me.

30
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,318
You should've been here, Willett!

31
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,738
Lettin' me go on thinkin'
everyone's dead and me next.

32
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:23,824
I pulled up fever-sick,
I said, Coley.

33
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:26,660
Now, become calm and tell me
in a way I can understand.

34
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,161
Where is Coigne?

35
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:32,958
Well, like I said, after you was gone Leland
and Coigne decided to run into Winslow.

36
00:05:33,058 --> 00:05:34,793
For the pleasure, Coigne says.

37
00:05:34,893 --> 00:05:36,795
"Can I go?" He says no.

38
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,965
"Someone's gotta watch over stores
and things, so you stay, Coley."

39
00:05:40,065 --> 00:05:42,259
Well, then they go off.

40
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:44,852
Not comin' back till
next morning, early.

41
00:05:45,362 --> 00:05:48,390
I get waked by them
pounding in like hell-bent.

42
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,602
Then I hear 'em talking mad and arguing,
so as I conclude they're drunk.

43
00:05:52,702 --> 00:05:55,897
I mean to go back to sleep when your
brother Coigne tears inside here...

44
00:05:55,997 --> 00:05:58,692
and grabs up his roll
mad as I ever seen.

45
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,694
I said, "What are you doing, Coigne?"

46
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:03,780
"Shut up," he says.
"I am taking your horse."

47
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,532
And he tears back out.

48
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,869
Sure enough, I see him throw
onto my Shorty and dig out fast.

49
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:12,080
And there stands Leland,
spittin' in the dust, disgusted.

50
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,750
"How come Coigne rode off
that-a-way, Leland?"

51
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,462
"He rode a man and a little person
down in the streets of Winslow.

52
00:06:18,562 --> 00:06:20,881
Maybe it was a child," Leland says.

53
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:23,425
"But did he kill 'em?" I ask.

54
00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:27,144
"He's not for sure, but he ain't waitin'
to find out, and now he's runnin'."

55
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:30,057
"Oh, I hate to hear it," I says.

56
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:34,234
Then I crawls back in to sleep,
assuming Leland done the same.

57
00:06:34,786 --> 00:06:36,688
But damned if I don't
get waked again.

58
00:06:36,788 --> 00:06:39,232
Leland's voice I hear,
and I don't know whose.

59
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:43,528
Thinking it's your brother, I open up the
flap and look out at Leland drinking coffee.

60
00:06:43,628 --> 00:06:47,240
I can't see nothing else, so I ask,
"Who you talking to, Leland?"

61
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,619
He looks like he's makin' to answer
or to take a mouth of coffee...

62
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:53,663
when just like that...

63
00:06:53,763 --> 00:06:56,166
his face all spitters out...

64
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:59,169
spilling in his coffee
and all over hisself...

65
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:02,172
with none of his
face left on with it.

66
00:07:02,272 --> 00:07:05,801
I reckon someone come to settle with Coigne
on account of what happened in Winslow...

67
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:07,469
and got Leland instead.

68
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:10,771
Figurin' I'm next, I jumped
back inside, scared white.

69
00:07:13,992 --> 00:07:16,645
Give me the whips and
jingles so bad, Will, I...

70
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:18,779
I can't yet catch hold of myself.

71
00:07:20,624 --> 00:07:22,901
Is that the whole way of it, Coley?

72
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:24,402
I believe.

73
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:28,539
My mind's all unsatisfied with it.

74
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:32,452
Seem to me like if Leland had been
involved with the event in Winslow...

75
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:35,747
he'd have rode off too, wouldn't he,
like the way you told me Coigne done.

76
00:07:35,847 --> 00:07:41,211
Run a man and a little person down.
That's all Leland said. Maybe it was a child.

77
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,005
He's just a-sittin' there,
gettin' killed that-a-way?

78
00:07:44,105 --> 00:07:46,299
I got no understanding of it at all.

79
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,352
It's a terrible thing.

80
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:51,304
- Give me hold of your gun, Coley.
- What you want it for?

81
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,723
I might be gonna need it,
so just give it to me.

82
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:57,602
No. I might be just a-needin' it too.
How do I know? All these happenings.

83
00:07:57,702 --> 00:08:00,147
I hate to tell ya,
all riled up like you are...

84
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:03,567
but I been trailed most of the
way here by I don't know who.

85
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:06,820
Where's your own gun?
Go on and use your own gun.

86
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,156
Well, it plainly ain't there,
or I wouldn't be asking you.

87
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:11,825
No, sir. No. Not with
trouble on the way.

88
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,542
I'm tired, Coley.

89
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,913
And I can't get me no sleep
without you give it to me.

90
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:18,797
What about me?

91
00:08:19,891 --> 00:08:21,633
It's all right.

92
00:08:24,312 --> 00:08:26,513
You'll be dependin' on me.

93
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:38,692
Whereas it wouldn't have worked
out the other way around.

94
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:47,451
Well, here I sit.

95
00:08:51,214 --> 00:08:52,824
Just keep an ear, Coley.

96
00:08:52,924 --> 00:08:55,702
Sure. Them with the gun can sleep.

97
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:59,206
Ain't as though I ain't been hawkin' night
sounds till I can't tell a twit from a twig.

98
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:02,508
Shoot, I'm as tired as you.
Every bit.

99
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,387
Willett?

100
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:22,903
Hey, Will?

101
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,899
I'm depending on you.

102
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,741
Okay?

103
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:36,243
Lord A'mighty.

104
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:39,127
I'm so hungry I could
chaw off my own arm.

105
00:09:44,976 --> 00:09:46,927
I wouldn't sit there, Will.

106
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,756
That's right where he was at.

107
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:53,426
And right like you're sittin',
drinkin' coffee.

108
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:56,353
Go on and stow them stores
in the tent, Coley.

109
00:10:02,744 --> 00:10:06,648
Maybe... Maybe could
have been your imagination.

110
00:10:06,748 --> 00:10:08,400
Huh, Will? Y-You think?

111
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,242
Do like I say.

112
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,661
Aw, shoot.

113
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,498
How come I always
gotta be the one to...

114
00:10:20,428 --> 00:10:22,998
Sure gonna be a bunch
of ugly work, I'll tell ya...

115
00:10:23,098 --> 00:10:25,299
with just the one hand.

116
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:31,638
One more thing ain't to my likin'.

117
00:10:59,217 --> 00:11:02,662
<i>Aw, Bill, you can have my saddle</i>

118
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:05,255
<i>George, you can take my bed</i>

119
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,877
<i>Jack can have my pistol, boys</i>

120
00:11:08,977 --> 00:11:11,838
<i>After I am dead</i>

121
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:14,514
- Something's comin'.
- <i>Boys...</i>

122
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:19,679
Hey, remember, Willett,
how Leland used to sing that song?

123
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,806
'Member?

124
00:11:21,906 --> 00:11:25,150
<i>Oh, boys, think upon me kindly</i>

125
00:11:25,743 --> 00:11:28,737
<i>As you gaze upon my grave</i>

126
00:11:59,444 --> 00:12:01,436
Yes, sir.

127
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:04,599
Hey!

128
00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:06,226
You crazy?

129
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:08,694
You crazy? Don't stand there! Git!

130
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,697
Lord A'mighty, what's comin'?

131
00:12:15,585 --> 00:12:18,071
Go on then, Willett! Cover yourself!

132
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:19,823
I ain't got no gun! Remember?

133
00:12:19,923 --> 00:12:23,284
How am I gonna be dependin' on you,
starin' out into the sky like that?

134
00:12:23,384 --> 00:12:25,703
Shut up!

135
00:12:25,803 --> 00:12:27,497
I see somethin'!

136
00:12:27,597 --> 00:12:29,916
- Something's comin'!
- From where?

137
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:32,884
Straight ahead. A bit to the right.

138
00:12:33,436 --> 00:12:35,422
Get up here, Willett,
while there's still time!

139
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:38,724
- Just one?
- I can't see.

140
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:41,010
Yeah. Yeah, one.

141
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,395
All right, Coley, get quiet now.

142
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:47,016
Duck back down.
Don't say nothin' at all.

143
00:12:47,116 --> 00:12:49,401
I'm gonna... get down.

144
00:12:51,496 --> 00:12:53,029
Will!

145
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:26,062
It's a woman.

146
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:58,505
Will ya look.
Will ya just look at that.

147
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:02,217
I'd be grateful if you'd
sell me one of your horses.

148
00:14:02,317 --> 00:14:04,851
You didn't arrive all to here afoot.

149
00:14:05,486 --> 00:14:09,015
My horse stumbled and
broke a leg. I shot him.

150
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:13,186
I'll pay you well for a good
horse and for some shelter.

151
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:18,358
And if you would help me, please,
I need to get my things off my horse.

152
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,527
Well, I'd sure be glad to, ma'am.

153
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:22,195
Wouldn't we, Will?

154
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:24,120
No trouble at all.

155
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:29,577
I'd like the brown one.

156
00:14:29,677 --> 00:14:31,162
The bay?

157
00:14:31,262 --> 00:14:33,623
Oh, well, that bay there is Will's.

158
00:14:33,723 --> 00:14:35,375
His, I mean, ma'am.

159
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,126
I like that one.

160
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:40,547
Well, main thing is,
I believe Will, he does too.

161
00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:46,386
I like the brown one!

162
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,222
I'm gon' give you that
black over there, miss.

163
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:52,767
He belonged to a dead man,
so's you don't have to pay for him.

164
00:14:52,867 --> 00:14:57,028
Coley, fetch Leland's pony
out with just a bridle on her.

165
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,195
What about Coigne's, Will?

166
00:15:04,295 --> 00:15:06,246
Well, he looks stove up.

167
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,624
Then I don't wanna be stuck with him.

168
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,745
Are you looking at me, Mr. Gashade?

169
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,747
How do you come by that name?

170
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,250
I hear you're a bounty
hunter, Mr. Gashade.

171
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,003
- I wouldn't name myself as that.
- No?

172
00:15:20,103 --> 00:15:22,589
It was just a way of
making wages once.

173
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:26,224
- And now?
- Mining suits me just.

174
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,186
Well, you look less
than prosperous at it.

175
00:15:37,495 --> 00:15:41,357
How much would you ask to take me
across the Supuecio to Kingsley?

176
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:43,109
I ain't askin'.

177
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:46,828
I told you I'd pay you very well.

178
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:49,956
And I said I'm doing just fine.

179
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,085
Look at me, Mr. Gashade.

180
00:15:54,762 --> 00:15:57,123
Without perishing from the
tricks of my own mind...

181
00:15:57,223 --> 00:16:00,133
how could I possibly get
to Kingsley on my own?

182
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:03,838
Well, I ain't the only one
knows the way, ma'am.

183
00:16:03,938 --> 00:16:06,139
But it's you I'm asking.

184
00:16:12,196 --> 00:16:14,356
Please think about it.

185
00:16:16,534 --> 00:16:18,735
That's just what I'm doing.

186
00:16:21,873 --> 00:16:24,282
Really nice pony you had here, miss.

187
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,620
Looks to me like you run
him to death though.

188
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:34,751
Good pony like this hard to come by.

189
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:40,340
What'd you shoot him for?

190
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,427
There ain't a broke or
unsound bone in his body.

191
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:55,021
I'll give you 500 now and
500 when we get there.

192
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:59,394
How long would it take?
Two weeks? Three?

193
00:16:59,494 --> 00:17:03,773
How much gold could you dig out of
this mine in three weeks, Mr. Gashade?

194
00:17:03,873 --> 00:17:05,692
Three weeks?

195
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:07,527
Let me figure.

196
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,828
Oh, I'd say, bein' it's a...

197
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:13,999
pretty dead hole, why...

198
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,703
Well, it wouldn't be
a hell of a much.

199
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,371
Would you say, Will?

200
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,915
Yeah, I done the best
I could for ol' Lee.

201
00:17:21,015 --> 00:17:25,294
By the time I got out my gun to help,
why, he was already dead.

202
00:17:25,394 --> 00:17:27,714
And what with Will's
brother run off...

203
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:32,218
well, there was only me to
do the best I know how...

204
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:34,060
for ol' Leland Drum.

205
00:17:34,737 --> 00:17:36,688
It isn't April.

206
00:17:37,448 --> 00:17:40,191
- What's that?
- It's March.

207
00:17:41,869 --> 00:17:43,563
Oh.

208
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:47,866
"His good friend in... March?"

209
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:56,451
She don't like me much.

210
00:17:56,551 --> 00:17:58,494
I don't know.

211
00:17:58,594 --> 00:18:01,122
Sure holds out good wages though.

212
00:18:01,222 --> 00:18:03,374
Yep.

213
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:05,293
But for what she don't say.

214
00:18:05,393 --> 00:18:07,594
Take her to Kingsley, she say.

215
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,965
We'll see.

216
00:18:11,065 --> 00:18:12,849
We're goin'?

217
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:15,351
I don't know.

218
00:18:16,404 --> 00:18:18,188
What, Will?

219
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:21,100
Well, if Coigne got in bad...

220
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,103
He went and harmed someone
or killed someone...

221
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,855
A man and a little person.

222
00:18:25,955 --> 00:18:29,157
I'm wondering why nobody's
come out here a-lookin' after him.

223
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:33,536
Maybe it was a child.

224
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:41,162
- Well, ma'am, I gotta...
- This water is not clean.

225
00:18:41,262 --> 00:18:42,705
In fact, it's stagnant!

226
00:18:44,105 --> 00:18:46,633
- Please!
- H-Hold on.

227
00:18:47,268 --> 00:18:49,295
Do frogs breed in this water?

228
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:50,838
Not frogs.

229
00:18:50,938 --> 00:18:53,800
- Well, what then?
- Oh, other things.

230
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,600
Here!

231
00:18:56,852 --> 00:18:58,453
Oh, I'm sorry!

232
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:01,474
What is that?

233
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:02,934
Well, it's all I could find.

234
00:19:03,034 --> 00:19:06,145
There's some type of snakes knowed
to take a romp in that water.

235
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,147
- In this water?
- Oh, yeah.

236
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,817
And people been knowed to swallow
one of their little eggs...

237
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,778
and it'll hatch out inside 'em without
they's knowing it till it's too late.

238
00:19:13,878 --> 00:19:15,905
What do you mean, too late?

239
00:19:16,005 --> 00:19:19,700
Well, suppose it was a poison snake
and it hatch out hungry, as they do.

240
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,120
Well, what's it gonna eat but the
nearest thing to it? And that's you.

241
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,832
Not me, because I didn't
swallow any of it.

242
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:27,875
Well, you're lucky then.

243
00:19:27,975 --> 00:19:30,510
Say, ma'am. Ma'am?

244
00:19:31,187 --> 00:19:34,889
I been considerin', and,
I got an offer to make.

245
00:19:35,566 --> 00:19:37,885
- Say, ma'am?
- Yes?

246
00:19:37,985 --> 00:19:39,801
I'll take you up to
Kingsley like you asked,

247
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:42,931
but Coley here's gonna
have to go along with me.

248
00:19:43,032 --> 00:19:46,401
And that's why I'm askin'
a thousand dollars...

249
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,320
so's I can pay him too.

250
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:52,907
Then there's that five you
mentioned when I get you there.

251
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:56,904
That's it.

252
00:19:57,004 --> 00:19:58,788
That's my offer.

253
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,371
All right.

254
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,672
Not fine, but all right.

255
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:09,959
Let's get started.

256
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:11,961
- Take it, Coley.
- No!

257
00:20:12,061 --> 00:20:14,262
You take it, Mr. Gashade.

258
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,719
I'm ready to go.

259
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,596
We'll go tomorrow.

260
00:20:21,696 --> 00:20:23,097
Now.

261
00:20:23,197 --> 00:20:25,641
Morning always makes a good start.

262
00:20:25,741 --> 00:20:28,352
Would you like to go with me now?

263
00:20:28,452 --> 00:20:29,937
Me?

264
00:20:30,037 --> 00:20:31,821
- Why, sure.
- Coley.

265
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,033
Take up the money then.

266
00:20:35,376 --> 00:20:37,535
- Coley...
- Go on!

267
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,282
- Coley!
- What, Will?

268
00:20:41,382 --> 00:20:43,242
Pack the mule.

269
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:44,785
No mule.

270
00:20:44,885 --> 00:20:48,414
I do not intend to be
held back by any mule.

271
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:51,417
Ain't nothin' will hold you
back like no vittles, ma'am.

272
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:53,343
No mule!

273
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:03,220
Gashade! Do you know Cross Tree?

274
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,065
- I do.
- Well, head for there, please.

275
00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:10,603
Cross Tree ain't Kingsley.

276
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:13,321
Never mind. First, Cross Tree!

277
00:21:14,165 --> 00:21:16,776
- It's out of the way.
- By how much?

278
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,653
Twenty, 25 miles.

279
00:21:18,753 --> 00:21:20,453
Which way?

280
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,959
Well, we'll have to go faster then.

281
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:28,329
Yes, sir.

282
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:31,631
You run on four now,
you walk on two later.

283
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:34,384
Haul freight, Coley!

284
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,519
Come on!

285
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,124
Look at that splay-legged,
plantered, spavined...

286
00:22:13,224 --> 00:22:16,127
wind-broke, damned droop-naped,
galled stumbler...

287
00:22:16,227 --> 00:22:18,170
Coigne went and stuck me with.

288
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,007
And takin' Shorty,
who was as sound as a nickel.

289
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:22,566
Hell!

290
00:22:24,235 --> 00:22:28,806
You can't haul no pale-pink, ratty,
walleyed devil mule behind no horse...

291
00:22:28,906 --> 00:22:31,017
that ain't got the
sense to switch flies!

292
00:22:31,117 --> 00:22:33,860
No kiddin'.

293
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:36,863
This ain't no fun.

294
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,785
Howdy, miss.

295
00:22:45,756 --> 00:22:47,498
We're stoppin', I guess.

296
00:22:56,851 --> 00:22:58,843
She stalled again?

297
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,597
Unpack the grub out of
those mules and let's eat.

298
00:23:17,746 --> 00:23:20,948
You could try and be
a little more pleasant.

299
00:23:21,876 --> 00:23:23,903
Is that mule tethered, Coley?

300
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:26,280
You sure have a pretty way.

301
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,867
I surely don't ask that
you be fond of me.

302
00:23:29,967 --> 00:23:31,410
Tend the mule.

303
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,080
"Fond of me."

304
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,214
Surely fond of me.

305
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:38,751
Hold the talk.

306
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:43,346
Not even snake water could be
more poisonous than this coffee.

307
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:46,550
Ma'am?

308
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,764
Do you think that maybe I could
call you by your name or somethin'?

309
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:55,267
I mean, of course,
"Miss" this or that. You know.

310
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,853
And respectful,
till you knew me better.

311
00:23:57,953 --> 00:24:02,525
All right. You just tell me,
what is your most favorite name?

312
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:04,409
Well...

313
00:24:05,336 --> 00:24:07,578
My most favorite name?

314
00:24:08,631 --> 00:24:10,116
Let's see.

315
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:12,993
My most favorite name...

316
00:24:13,093 --> 00:24:14,877
is...

317
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:20,042
Glory, sure is hard to
think of a lady-type name.

318
00:24:20,142 --> 00:24:22,593
Let's see. Well...

319
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:28,134
Yeah. There's my mama's name.
I know that one.

320
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:30,386
But now, I never did
call her that though.

321
00:24:30,486 --> 00:24:32,096
Well, just "Mama."

322
00:24:32,196 --> 00:24:35,391
That's all right, Coley.
You just tell me. What was it?

323
00:24:35,491 --> 00:24:38,727
Well, let's see.
My daddy called her by...

324
00:24:38,827 --> 00:24:40,646
Hortensia.

325
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:43,948
Well, don't ever call me that.

326
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,986
Well, ma'am...

327
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:49,155
just could you tell me what though?

328
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:52,158
Hush! She's been japin' you.
Can't you sense?

329
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:54,785
Now quit her,
'fore you get tromped on.

330
00:24:54,885 --> 00:24:56,669
Aw!

331
00:24:58,097 --> 00:25:00,833
Didn't you hear what she say, Will?

332
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:03,502
She called me by Coley.

333
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,504
She say...

334
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:08,507
"That's all right, Coley."

335
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:11,684
"Boyard, his good friend and-"

336
00:25:12,653 --> 00:25:15,438
I don't know.
Something's been scratched off.

337
00:25:16,323 --> 00:25:19,018
Looks to me like somebody
settled with one of 'em.

338
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:21,896
- Yeah, look like.
- You gonna want to find out?

339
00:25:21,996 --> 00:25:25,399
- Well, it don't matter.
- What about the other one?

340
00:25:25,499 --> 00:25:27,693
Could be anywheres.

341
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:31,697
Well, might be they're just tryin' to
throw us off with this here grave.

342
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:34,950
Well, then I'm throwed.

343
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,952
You mean we ain't followin' 'em?

344
00:25:37,052 --> 00:25:39,420
Hell, I got my duties.

345
00:25:45,853 --> 00:25:48,971
- It's so satisfying!
- Ma'am, you ain't sleepy?

346
00:25:50,107 --> 00:25:51,717
Come on. Let's get started.

347
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:53,518
Where's the mule?

348
00:25:54,236 --> 00:25:56,138
I told you to tether the mule!

349
00:25:56,238 --> 00:25:58,682
I did, Will. Ain't he there?

350
00:25:58,782 --> 00:26:00,684
I did, Will! I hobbled 'im.

351
00:26:00,784 --> 00:26:02,693
Right over here. I swear.

352
00:26:03,871 --> 00:26:06,739
You see? This here's
what I attached on 'im.

353
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:11,702
Well, somebody just went
and unattached him.

354
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:15,540
Will you please help me?

355
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:29,922
I wouldn't do that
if I was you, ma'am.

356
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:33,683
Frazer's layin' back his ears.
He's just likely to let fly.

357
00:26:38,113 --> 00:26:39,647
Exquisite.

358
00:26:43,452 --> 00:26:45,604
Cursed, hellish sun!

359
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:49,073
- Well, blow on your wrists.
- Oh, shut up!

360
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:54,154
You mind telling me why
we're goin' to Cross Tree?

361
00:26:54,254 --> 00:26:56,490
We're goin' to Cross Tree?

362
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,242
What for, Willett?

363
00:26:58,342 --> 00:27:00,293
For fresh horses?

364
00:27:01,095 --> 00:27:03,205
That's right. Fresh horses.

365
00:27:04,305 --> 00:27:05,890
So long, ol' Funeral.

366
00:27:07,184 --> 00:27:09,302
March!

367
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,390
Coley?

368
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:21,307
Get two horses and as much store as you
can pack on behind the three of 'em.

369
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:24,143
- No mule?
- No mule.

370
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:26,562
Only two ponies, Will?
How 'bout ol' Frazer?

371
00:27:26,662 --> 00:27:29,481
- He's sound. Only two.
- Wait, Will.

372
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:32,151
Say, could I have me a little
of that money for myself?

373
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:34,320
- What for?
- Aw, shoot. Nothin'.

374
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,989
Just so I could, you know, get me
some do-funnies. Hell, somethin'.

375
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:39,874
You just get them horses
packed and...

376
00:27:40,426 --> 00:27:42,627
get yourself a gun.

377
00:27:55,649 --> 00:27:57,760
You just come from over there...

378
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,012
and seen this friend of mine.

379
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:02,306
Did you? A woman?

380
00:28:02,406 --> 00:28:05,976
Well, that's all right.
I'm traveling right along with her.

381
00:28:06,076 --> 00:28:07,936
What's her name?

382
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,691
Huh?

383
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,533
Hold on here.

384
00:28:17,713 --> 00:28:22,124
Listen, you tell me who she is and what she's
doing over there, or I'll break you in half.

385
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:24,543
Have the paper?

386
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,631
What do you mean, a paper?

387
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:32,218
Writing? A letter?

388
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:34,887
Do you read?

389
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:39,218
Who give it to you?

390
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:41,053
Beard.

391
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:43,972
- Bear?
- Beard man.

392
00:28:44,072 --> 00:28:46,683
You mean a bearded man?

393
00:28:46,783 --> 00:28:48,317
That's all? No name?

394
00:28:48,785 --> 00:28:50,569
Beard man.

395
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,023
Where'd he go?

396
00:28:53,123 --> 00:28:54,824
Far.

397
00:28:55,584 --> 00:28:58,028
- North.
- Far.

398
00:29:34,164 --> 00:29:36,525
Poor, sorry sight you are.

399
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:39,910
Hey. Want a piece of candy, Shorty?

400
00:29:40,921 --> 00:29:42,413
Is that Shorty?

401
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,666
Hi, Will. Look who this is.

402
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,877
My ol' Shorty.

403
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:50,456
All done...

404
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:52,757
with a real bad cracked foot.

405
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,676
Coigne's been here.

406
00:29:56,436 --> 00:29:58,839
- Where's he at? Did you ask?
- He ruined 'im.

407
00:29:58,939 --> 00:30:00,966
Traded him off.

408
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:04,636
The man's gonna get rid of him,
he says, 'cause he ain't no use.

409
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,638
What'd he tell you of Coigne?

410
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,689
Just nothin'.

411
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:12,227
Coigne come here a while back.

412
00:30:12,327 --> 00:30:14,730
Then he just left. Couple days ago.

413
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,483
The man don't know wheres neither,
'cause I asked him all them kind of things.

414
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:20,777
He don't know nothin' about it.
Just sold him a horse.

415
00:30:20,877 --> 00:30:23,078
Give him poor ol' Shorty.

416
00:30:28,719 --> 00:30:30,336
Hey, Will.

417
00:30:31,638 --> 00:30:33,207
What's he runnin' from?

418
00:30:33,307 --> 00:30:36,509
He wasn't runnin'. The man
didn't say he was. Hey, Will.

419
00:30:37,686 --> 00:30:40,756
Could you give me... $50?

420
00:30:40,856 --> 00:30:42,591
I want this one!

421
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:45,093
Change my saddle over to this one.

422
00:30:45,193 --> 00:30:46,936
Right off.

423
00:30:47,988 --> 00:30:50,015
What do you want the 50 for?

424
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:52,024
Oh, you know.

425
00:30:52,826 --> 00:30:54,527
So's he won't...

426
00:30:55,579 --> 00:30:58,565
- Sooner or later, Coley...
- What's $50, Will?

427
00:30:58,665 --> 00:31:01,527
So let him stand and
eat till I get back.

428
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:05,037
I'd like to be asked
my preference first.

429
00:31:07,215 --> 00:31:09,451
Mr. Gashade!

430
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:11,752
You want a piece of candy, Will?

431
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:18,835
Now you begin to earn your pay.

432
00:31:18,935 --> 00:31:20,427
Kingsley?

433
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:22,888
We'll see.

434
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,641
Plan to shoot a bit?

435
00:31:27,736 --> 00:31:31,897
What if I was just to up and
pull out, keep the money?

436
00:31:32,199 --> 00:31:35,102
Unless I know right here
and now what you're after.

437
00:31:35,202 --> 00:31:37,862
You're not the only one
who knows the way.

438
00:32:19,788 --> 00:32:21,773
Looking for something in there?

439
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:25,075
Day and a half, near two days old.

440
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,471
Come on.

441
00:32:52,028 --> 00:32:53,930
You sure are gettin'
good at that, ma'am.

442
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,599
- So are you, Coley.
- Me?

443
00:32:55,699 --> 00:32:57,900
So is Mr. Gashade.

444
00:32:58,827 --> 00:33:00,646
We're making time.

445
00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:04,232
Why are we all the time hurrying?
What's the pleasure?

446
00:33:04,332 --> 00:33:06,575
I'm the one gettin' all the dust!

447
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:14,326
<i>Oh, up in the mornin'</i>

448
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:16,328
<i>Toward daylight</i>

449
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:18,205
<i>Before I sleep</i>

450
00:33:18,305 --> 00:33:20,791
<i>The moon shines bright</i>

451
00:33:20,891 --> 00:33:23,168
<i>And my horse tossed me off</i>

452
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:25,879
<i>In a freezin' cold brook</i>

453
00:33:25,979 --> 00:33:29,098
<i>And my horse tossed me off</i>

454
00:33:30,901 --> 00:33:34,680
<i>Oh, I jump in the saddle
Grab hold of the horn</i>

455
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,349
If I heard your name, I wouldn't know it.

456
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:39,601
<i>Come a-ti-yi
yippy-yippy-yay, yippy-yay</i>

457
00:33:39,701 --> 00:33:42,020
<i>Come a-ti-yi, yippy-yippy-yay</i>

458
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:46,024
- Would I?
- No.

459
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,360
<i>Give a little yell</i>

460
00:33:53,213 --> 00:33:57,119
- I don't see no point to it.
- There isn't any.

461
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,009
What's that?

462
00:34:06,102 --> 00:34:08,797
<i>Oh, I heard it in the holler</i>
I'm just singin'.

463
00:34:08,897 --> 00:34:10,298
It's all right, Coley.

464
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:11,633
<i>And I done real well</i>

465
00:34:11,733 --> 00:34:13,885
<i>Till the boss said,
"Boy, go and give 'em hell"</i>

466
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:16,471
<i>Come a-ti-yi
yippy-yippy-yay, yippy-yay</i>

467
00:34:16,571 --> 00:34:18,223
<i>Come a-ti-yi yippy-yippy-yay</i>

468
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:22,369
- You sure you don't wanna light down?
- How's the trail?

469
00:34:27,624 --> 00:34:29,067
Pretty cold.

470
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,944
But you'll pick it up, won't you?

471
00:34:31,044 --> 00:34:32,946
<i>Best damn cowboy ever was born</i>

472
00:34:33,046 --> 00:34:34,948
That's what I was
supposed to do, ain't it?

473
00:34:35,048 --> 00:34:38,000
Not if you're a gold miner,
Mr. Gashade.

474
00:34:41,847 --> 00:34:43,665
<i>Come a-ti-yi
yippy-yippy-yay, yippy-yay</i>

475
00:34:43,765 --> 00:34:46,216
<i>Come a-ti-yi yippy-yippy-yay</i>

476
00:34:51,481 --> 00:34:54,134
<i>Oh, stray in the herd
and the boss says kill it</i>

477
00:34:54,234 --> 00:34:57,978
<i>So I shot him in the rump
with the handle of a...</i>

478
00:34:59,489 --> 00:35:01,224
Willett!

479
00:35:01,324 --> 00:35:03,192
Look over yonderly.

480
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:10,692
Yes, sir.

481
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:12,618
Damn.

482
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,238
Might be some folk?

483
00:35:15,338 --> 00:35:19,416
Maybe so.

484
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,711
He see us too, you think?

485
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,756
Oh, yeah, he see us.

486
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:57,621
What is it?

487
00:35:59,132 --> 00:36:01,333
Tracks is freshening a bit.

488
00:36:10,477 --> 00:36:13,679
Trail breaks off here
and heads that way.

489
00:36:15,023 --> 00:36:18,642
- Too bad.
- Wait. Where are you going?

490
00:36:20,195 --> 00:36:21,895
Kingsley.

491
00:36:22,489 --> 00:36:24,481
No! Follow that!

492
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:29,437
Well, looks to me like this 'un's
headed dead into the Supuecio?

493
00:36:29,537 --> 00:36:33,115
It's bad enough we gotta cross
part of it to get to Kingsley.

494
00:36:36,336 --> 00:36:38,954
You won't get there that way at all.

495
00:36:41,591 --> 00:36:44,334
Then why would someone
want to go this way?

496
00:36:44,886 --> 00:36:49,541
To get theirselves lost is the only reason
outside of ignorance that I can give.

497
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:52,259
We'll follow it, Mr. Gashade.

498
00:36:59,943 --> 00:37:02,137
Hell, I don't see nothin'.

499
00:37:02,237 --> 00:37:04,438
What are we followin' anyhow?

500
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,734
You think you know who laid down
this trail better than I do, miss.

501
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:19,112
How do you know it's gonna
show up what you after?

502
00:37:19,212 --> 00:37:22,073
I just can see you, you know...

503
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:24,868
all up in them goldurned pretty flax.

504
00:37:24,968 --> 00:37:26,543
Hold your horse.

505
00:37:33,518 --> 00:37:35,754
What's this shootin' all the time?

506
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:38,256
You're tryin' to tell someone
where we at. Ain't that so?

507
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:40,682
You're so stupid.

508
00:37:42,986 --> 00:37:44,888
You gon' tell me what
this is all about.

509
00:37:44,988 --> 00:37:47,981
- I hate you.
- She's just practicin', Will.

510
00:37:49,117 --> 00:37:51,895
What's the matter with you, miss?
You got somethin' wrong?

511
00:37:51,995 --> 00:37:54,272
- She look like sick, Will.
- Don't touch me!

512
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,441
That rider back there. Who is he?

513
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:59,819
- He's a-followin' after us.
- Light up on her, Will. Can't you see?

514
00:37:59,919 --> 00:38:02,030
Oh, now look what you done. Miss?

515
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:05,116
- She's waltzin'.
- Let me help you down off.

516
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,953
- Stop groping at me!
- Well, you was slippin'.

517
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:09,621
I'm not!

518
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:13,006
It's just an excuse to touch me.

519
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:17,379
Will you stop staring at me!

520
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:20,799
Get back up on
your horse, Mr. Gashade.

521
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:23,677
You're feeling that bad, miss,
maybe you oughta light down.

522
00:38:23,777 --> 00:38:25,845
How much sun is left?

523
00:38:25,945 --> 00:38:27,729
An hour, maybe.

524
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:32,317
Well, we're keepin'
on till dark, I guess.

525
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:43,203
You don't like her much, Will, do ya?

526
00:38:45,673 --> 00:38:48,326
She ain't showing me nothin' to like.

527
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:51,329
But you're goin' along with
her then 'cause she's pretty.

528
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:54,756
Hell, pretty ain't nothin'.

529
00:38:55,517 --> 00:38:58,211
It'll pleasure you
nothin' but the eye.

530
00:38:58,311 --> 00:39:00,714
Why, a coral snake, its ring's
prettier than a rainbow...

531
00:39:00,814 --> 00:39:04,509
but it's got a real mean way
of pain in it, is the fact.

532
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:07,352
Well, I'm glad then you
ain't crazy after her.

533
00:39:08,404 --> 00:39:10,098
No.

534
00:39:10,198 --> 00:39:13,435
It's just a... a feeling
I got to see through.

535
00:39:13,535 --> 00:39:14,853
Just that.

536
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:17,147
The reason bein' 'cause I am.

537
00:39:17,247 --> 00:39:20,449
And I wouldn't want us
gettin' touchy over Miss...

538
00:39:21,251 --> 00:39:22,993
Her.

539
00:39:27,132 --> 00:39:30,167
Well, you just try and
forget about her, Coley.

540
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:33,795
Because she's got other
interests than you.

541
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,465
Sayin' what, Will?

542
00:39:42,063 --> 00:39:45,383
Sayin' I pretty much believe
she means to kill someone.

543
00:39:58,246 --> 00:40:00,989
Will you please help me?

544
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:08,656
Would it be too much to expect
that you might have some tea?

545
00:40:08,756 --> 00:40:11,291
Tea? I got tea!

546
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,249
Tea? How 'bout that?

547
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,960
Ask her if she want a cold
wash to her and a spoon.

548
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:24,388
I seen and got it special.
Tea. Special tea.

549
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,800
"Tea."

550
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,683
Look!

551
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:33,098
"Lei Ling's Cut Black Comfort Tea.

552
00:40:33,198 --> 00:40:35,524
Forsythe, R.I."

553
00:40:37,577 --> 00:40:39,277
How sweet.

554
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:01,167
What are you workin' on him for?

555
00:41:01,267 --> 00:41:03,135
He's easier than you.

556
00:41:03,811 --> 00:41:05,929
He don't see what I see.

557
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,810
Maybe he's the more useful to me.

558
00:41:12,111 --> 00:41:14,013
You think that he's gonna be able...

559
00:41:14,113 --> 00:41:16,808
to lead you on this trail
to the Supuecio?

560
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:18,351
If you won't, maybe.

561
00:41:18,451 --> 00:41:19,978
Maybe nothin', miss.

562
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:23,864
He may go pantin' after you like a little
doggie, but he can't lead you nowhere.

563
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:28,535
Well, he can't stop me either.

564
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:31,580
Now leave me alone and let me sleep.

565
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:38,955
- You see that how I done?
- Give me that!

566
00:41:39,055 --> 00:41:41,381
You disgustingly stupid...

567
00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:51,308
What's the matter? He wouldn't give
the wrong signal for you this time?

568
00:42:22,682 --> 00:42:24,792
Which it'd mean?

569
00:42:24,892 --> 00:42:27,093
Come in or stay off?

570
00:42:32,233 --> 00:42:33,934
Who's out there?

571
00:42:37,238 --> 00:42:38,757
Who is it?

572
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:42,560
No, please! Don't put your
hand anywhere near your gun.

573
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,528
He can see you.

574
00:43:00,595 --> 00:43:02,796
Who the hell is out there?

575
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:06,501
Billy Spear?

576
00:43:41,886 --> 00:43:43,288
What's your trouble?

577
00:43:43,388 --> 00:43:45,130
Nothing, Billy.

578
00:43:45,973 --> 00:43:47,674
It was a mistake.

579
00:43:50,812 --> 00:43:52,512
A mistake?

580
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:33,428
He that one we seen
way back, ain't he?

581
00:44:36,524 --> 00:44:38,558
What she want with him?

582
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,227
You did somethin'.

583
00:44:41,654 --> 00:44:43,855
See how she look like him?

584
00:44:44,657 --> 00:44:46,642
Hell, I don't see that.

585
00:44:46,742 --> 00:44:49,361
He's about as unfriend-like
a thing as I ever seen.

586
00:44:50,329 --> 00:44:51,981
No, sir, I don't like him.

587
00:44:52,081 --> 00:44:55,109
Well, I hope you're gonna
keep that to yourself, Coley.

588
00:44:55,209 --> 00:44:57,487
Why should I? What do I care?

589
00:44:57,587 --> 00:45:00,997
For the reason bein' that there's
a hired gun if ever I seen one.

590
00:45:01,924 --> 00:45:05,126
I don't want you to do nothin' to put
yourself in the way of it. Okay?

591
00:45:06,971 --> 00:45:09,506
Well, if you say, okay.

592
00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:15,845
Shoot. Real strong on the pretty,
ain't he, way he got himself up?

593
00:45:33,289 --> 00:45:34,982
What's that you got there?

594
00:45:35,082 --> 00:45:36,984
Aw, just a game.

595
00:45:37,084 --> 00:45:39,070
You're supposed to get
them little buckshot...

596
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:40,988
in the feller's eyes, see?

597
00:45:41,088 --> 00:45:42,824
The same into his mouth.

598
00:45:42,924 --> 00:45:45,291
It's real hard to do.
I ain't been able to yet.

599
00:46:07,365 --> 00:46:09,065
This is Billy Spear.

600
00:46:11,452 --> 00:46:15,613
He wasn't to join us until later,
but now it doesn't matter. He's here.

601
00:46:16,207 --> 00:46:17,991
He'll be going on with us.

602
00:46:18,584 --> 00:46:20,285
That figures.

603
00:46:22,088 --> 00:46:23,573
Mr. Gashade...

604
00:46:23,673 --> 00:46:26,367
but does that figure us
now as three or as four?

605
00:46:26,467 --> 00:46:28,168
Well, let me see.

606
00:46:28,803 --> 00:46:32,547
Whatever you brought him along for,
one thing it ain't is for followin' sign...

607
00:46:33,099 --> 00:46:36,384
or you wouldn't have had to shoot up
half the countryside to get him here.

608
00:46:37,853 --> 00:46:39,763
So figurin' it that-a-way...

609
00:46:40,147 --> 00:46:42,967
I ain't displaced and I'm
still earnin' my pay.

610
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:45,595
Well, hey. You got 'em in,
every one of 'em.

611
00:46:45,695 --> 00:46:47,395
How 'bout that?

612
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:50,141
Hey, I got another one too...

613
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:52,776
but with a nigra's face,
you wanna try.

614
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:58,281
Good then. I hope we'll make an
effort now to all try and get along.

615
00:47:02,253 --> 00:47:04,996
So we'll get started,
say, in three hours.

616
00:47:05,464 --> 00:47:07,332
Say sunup.

617
00:47:19,103 --> 00:47:22,340
Hey, look, miss. There's one of
them pretty little blue jay birds.

618
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,308
Make a wish. It's a
true sign of good luck.

619
00:47:30,031 --> 00:47:31,682
How's that, Billy Spear?

620
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:35,068
Real sharp. Poor draw.

621
00:47:41,459 --> 00:47:44,529
These are the last trees
you gonna see for a while.

622
00:47:44,629 --> 00:47:47,163
So if you're plannin' to shoot
anything else up, then...

623
00:47:54,513 --> 00:47:56,214
Yes, sir.

624
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:07,179
These here appear to be as
fresh as yesterday's, miss,

625
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,202
and there ain't no hurry to 'em.

626
00:48:09,904 --> 00:48:12,807
Like they don't think they're bein'
followed and they don't care.

627
00:48:12,907 --> 00:48:16,143
It shouldn't take us too much longer
to catch up to him, should it?

628
00:48:16,243 --> 00:48:18,736
"Him," miss? I say "they."

629
00:48:19,288 --> 00:48:22,191
The one we been followin' got joined
a little ways back by another.

630
00:48:22,291 --> 00:48:23,985
These tracks is made by two horses.

631
00:48:24,085 --> 00:48:25,528
Two men?

632
00:48:25,628 --> 00:48:27,328
Well, let's go.

633
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,993
- Hold on, miss.
- Leave me alone, Gashade.

634
00:48:32,093 --> 00:48:35,295
I can see the trail easily.
I don't even need you.

635
00:48:36,931 --> 00:48:38,631
Billy!

636
00:49:19,974 --> 00:49:23,009
Ain't you got no wipes?
Here. You can use mine.

637
00:49:24,145 --> 00:49:25,845
Move along.

638
00:49:57,643 --> 00:49:59,278
Hold up!

639
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:06,552
You can feel that, can't ya,
that horse goin' lame?

640
00:50:08,022 --> 00:50:11,683
No, no. That ain't gonna make
no difference to the horse.

641
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:13,969
Gonna make a difference
to you, that's all...

642
00:50:14,069 --> 00:50:16,396
bein' it's your grub you're
tossin' off, not mine.

643
00:50:17,364 --> 00:50:21,067
You're willin' to destruct
everything, even yourself.

644
00:50:28,876 --> 00:50:30,118
Quit with that.

645
00:50:35,633 --> 00:50:37,667
I say somethin' to you?

646
00:50:44,725 --> 00:50:49,303
I don't give a curly-hair, yellow-beard,
double-dog damn if you did.

647
00:50:57,279 --> 00:50:59,856
I'm gonna blow your face off.

648
00:51:25,307 --> 00:51:27,042
Two up on old Frazier?

649
00:51:27,142 --> 00:51:29,420
Sure gonna be pretty nasty for him.

650
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,422
- You wanna walk?
- Nah, but hell.

651
00:51:31,522 --> 00:51:33,674
Why wouldn't she get on behind me?

652
00:51:33,774 --> 00:51:37,511
If you don't shake your mind loose of her,
I got no respect for you, damn it.

653
00:51:37,611 --> 00:51:39,930
You don't remember her near
shootin' your head off?

654
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:49,190
- Will?
- What?

655
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:53,319
I got a funny feelin'. I don't
even know if to say or not.

656
00:51:53,419 --> 00:51:56,363
Well, don't then.
Just try shuttin' up, damn it!

657
00:51:56,463 --> 00:51:58,783
- I don't wanna lose this horse.
- Okay, okay, Willett.

658
00:51:58,883 --> 00:52:00,618
I'm likely just
spookin' again anyhow.

659
00:52:00,718 --> 00:52:03,704
Triple them wages and triple 'em again.
I ain't goin' that far.

660
00:52:03,804 --> 00:52:05,706
You moo to me one more
time 'bout her...

661
00:52:05,806 --> 00:52:07,458
and I'm gon' knock you
down without a word.

662
00:52:07,558 --> 00:52:09,376
I wasn't talkin' about her.

663
00:52:09,476 --> 00:52:13,130
Well, you went and give up your horse
to her so easy it makes me sick.

664
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,883
- And here you are now a burden to mine.
- I'm sorry, Willett.

665
00:52:15,983 --> 00:52:20,137
Well, just shut up. I can't
take no more of ya. No, sir.

666
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:22,515
For all the dirty rotten
gall and hate of a thing...

667
00:52:22,615 --> 00:52:25,392
that ought never above the
ground be called a woman.

668
00:52:25,492 --> 00:52:27,102
No, sir.

669
00:52:27,202 --> 00:52:29,104
I've lost it.

670
00:52:29,204 --> 00:52:30,815
Will you please go ahead now?

671
00:52:30,915 --> 00:52:32,782
Take on Coley then.

672
00:52:34,043 --> 00:52:36,244
Light down and change the damn packs.

673
00:52:38,881 --> 00:52:41,374
No! You take him.

674
00:52:42,635 --> 00:52:45,253
You wanna ride with me, boy?

675
00:52:48,766 --> 00:52:50,216
Leave him.

676
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:52,802
You better be japin'.

677
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,672
I ain't.

678
00:52:54,772 --> 00:52:57,849
Mr. Gashade, it's not a bad idea.

679
00:52:58,943 --> 00:53:02,019
We'll make better time,
and then we can come back for him.

680
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,856
You'll need this pack, Coley.

681
00:53:05,324 --> 00:53:07,024
Take it off.

682
00:53:07,826 --> 00:53:08,853
Will?

683
00:53:08,953 --> 00:53:11,112
It's all right. You ain't stayin'.

684
00:53:11,747 --> 00:53:15,449
You see? You see, just this minute,
he's taking up time.

685
00:53:16,085 --> 00:53:17,695
I have to insist that he stays.

686
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:21,956
Come on. Get back up here, Coley.
He'll ride ya just fine.

687
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,509
You see the way of it, Coley?

688
00:53:35,479 --> 00:53:39,098
You'll be all right here.
You just bide it easy.

689
00:53:39,984 --> 00:53:41,851
I'll come back for you.

690
00:53:42,778 --> 00:53:45,222
How long you think that'll be, Will?

691
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:47,732
Bring me over the guns, boy.

692
00:54:00,004 --> 00:54:01,704
Not long.

693
00:54:05,259 --> 00:54:07,877
They ain't got left
but one sack of grub.

694
00:54:08,846 --> 00:54:11,756
And no way of knowin' it I ain't
gonna lead 'em straight into hell.

695
00:54:16,103 --> 00:54:17,803
Move on.

696
00:54:19,982 --> 00:54:21,349
Coley?

697
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:38,574
Find some shade.

698
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:51,671
Oh, wait, miss.

699
00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:58,511
Can I get my things out of there?

700
00:55:10,741 --> 00:55:12,441
Oh, I almost forgot.

701
00:55:19,666 --> 00:55:21,951
- Thank you, Coley.
- It's all right.

702
00:55:24,546 --> 00:55:26,414
See y'all later, I guess.

703
00:55:30,552 --> 00:55:33,004
You wanna ride with me, boy?

704
00:55:36,558 --> 00:55:41,053
Okay. I'd soon not get left
behind here like this.

705
00:55:42,606 --> 00:55:45,300
How'd you like the way
I done Leland Drum?

706
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,178
Like I say, I'll blow it
off the first word out.

707
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:50,146
Go sit down over there.

708
00:56:04,253 --> 00:56:06,203
And think on this:

709
00:56:06,713 --> 00:56:08,615
Far as your voice gonna carry...

710
00:56:08,715 --> 00:56:12,960
ain't too far for me to turn right
round and hit you in the eye.

711
00:56:18,892 --> 00:56:22,428
Your brain gonna fry out here.
You know that?

712
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:38,110
Oh, Willett.

713
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:45,868
It's easier to stay behind.

714
00:56:48,755 --> 00:56:51,290
If I let you go too, would you go?

715
00:56:53,844 --> 00:56:55,829
Do you hear what I'm saying?

716
00:56:55,929 --> 00:56:57,498
I could've left anytime.

717
00:56:57,598 --> 00:56:59,715
I'm talking about now.

718
00:57:01,935 --> 00:57:03,969
I got my reasons for stayin'.

719
00:57:04,771 --> 00:57:06,256
Reasons?

720
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:08,557
There ain't gonna be no kill.

721
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:13,979
The reason, Mr. Gashade,
for a hunt is the kill.

722
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:23,273
Are you talkin' to me?

723
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:25,074
No, Billy.

724
00:57:27,211 --> 00:57:29,286
Feel like you was.

725
00:57:29,922 --> 00:57:32,123
It was just to myself.

726
00:57:34,218 --> 00:57:36,912
I've read a person's thoughts.

727
00:57:37,012 --> 00:57:39,046
Many times.

728
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,634
You never take those off, do you?

729
00:57:46,438 --> 00:57:47,923
He talkin' to me?

730
00:57:48,023 --> 00:57:50,092
Not even with a woman.

731
00:57:50,192 --> 00:57:52,268
What'd he have to say?

732
00:58:01,036 --> 00:58:03,237
He knows why you're here.

733
00:58:10,754 --> 00:58:13,456
I wouldn't worry after
your friend, you know.

734
00:58:14,091 --> 00:58:17,418
He's got a real relaxin'
time compared to us.

735
00:58:18,637 --> 00:58:21,922
No, that's right. No worries.

736
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:26,886
He's where I want him, back there.
Clear and safe of you.

737
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,381
Look at that.

738
00:59:07,811 --> 00:59:11,089
Wait! I'll go first now.

739
00:59:11,189 --> 00:59:13,390
Billy, keep him back a way.

740
00:59:44,056 --> 00:59:45,756
Who is he?

741
00:59:48,143 --> 00:59:49,885
Ask her.

742
00:59:53,774 --> 00:59:55,474
You know him?

743
00:59:58,612 --> 01:00:00,479
She payin' you good for this?

744
01:00:02,698 --> 01:00:04,399
Good as you.

745
01:00:07,412 --> 01:00:09,697
Twice as much wouldn't buy you off.

746
01:00:12,125 --> 01:00:14,451
Yeah, I figured you'd
likely do it for nothin'.

747
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:19,999
- Nearly nothin'.
- What for?

748
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,421
For her?

749
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:28,757
What does she mean to you?

750
01:00:31,019 --> 01:00:32,720
She liked me.

751
01:00:43,031 --> 01:00:45,232
You know anything about her?

752
01:00:45,909 --> 01:00:47,610
Her name even?

753
01:00:51,498 --> 01:00:53,198
Ask her.

754
01:00:59,005 --> 01:01:00,831
What lies in that direction?

755
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:05,628
- More of the same.
- No, but beyond that.

756
01:01:08,306 --> 01:01:10,083
- Kingsley.
- You're right.

757
01:01:10,183 --> 01:01:12,551
Kingsley, Gashade, not hell.

758
01:01:13,145 --> 01:01:16,013
What about him?
He don't interest you?

759
01:01:16,273 --> 01:01:19,009
No, not now. His leg's broken.

760
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:21,928
- Who is he?
- Just a friend.

761
01:01:22,028 --> 01:01:23,430
Friend?

762
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:28,016
- Like me and him.
- Yes, like you and Billy.

763
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:33,982
Where's his horse?
I don't see no horse.

764
01:01:34,082 --> 01:01:37,569
He must have wandered away.
You thinking of Coley?

765
01:01:37,669 --> 01:01:40,704
Yeah. He could've used it.

766
01:01:41,339 --> 01:01:44,917
Bein' as you're leavin' that poor jay
a-layin' out there starin' up at the sun.

767
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:47,621
I left him some water.

768
01:01:47,721 --> 01:01:49,421
Well, ain't that somethin'?

769
01:01:51,224 --> 01:01:52,876
Why didn't you just shoot him?

770
01:01:54,476 --> 01:01:57,046
Billy, did you ever
leave behind a friend?

771
01:01:57,898 --> 01:01:59,807
I never did have one.

772
01:02:01,485 --> 01:02:03,644
How about you, Willett?

773
01:02:04,196 --> 01:02:05,896
It's different.

774
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:08,857
He's better off where he's at.

775
01:03:42,252 --> 01:03:43,952
When?

776
01:03:45,422 --> 01:03:47,122
This mornin'.

777
01:03:55,265 --> 01:03:57,466
- Let's eat him.
- No, Billy.

778
01:03:58,435 --> 01:04:00,128
You don't want any?

779
01:04:00,228 --> 01:04:01,553
It's candy.

780
01:04:02,564 --> 01:04:04,890
It's all I got to give. I'm sorry.

781
01:04:06,693 --> 01:04:08,678
Don't mention it.

782
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:11,480
And I'm real sorry too I
can't help you none...

783
01:04:12,115 --> 01:04:14,650
bein' as I gotta catch
'em as fast as I can.

784
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:17,110
Yonderly?

785
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:19,488
That way, you say.

786
01:04:23,877 --> 01:04:25,577
What?

787
01:04:26,129 --> 01:04:29,998
Oh, oh, sure. I-I'll be back for ya.
Me and Will.

788
01:04:30,634 --> 01:04:32,835
I hate to leave ya layin', you know.

789
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:36,373
Oh, say.

790
01:04:36,473 --> 01:04:38,215
Here now.

791
01:04:39,934 --> 01:04:43,595
You take one of these too.
Which one'd you like?

792
01:04:45,065 --> 01:04:46,550
That 'un?

793
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:49,935
I'm surprised. Most people
wouldn't have chose that 'un.

794
01:04:53,197 --> 01:04:56,560
- What?
- Water. W...

795
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:59,236
I said it's all gone.

796
01:06:20,744 --> 01:06:24,738
Quit with that. I don't
like that, what you're doin'.

797
01:06:27,125 --> 01:06:29,076
This horse is goin'!

798
01:06:29,711 --> 01:06:31,411
So's his!

799
01:06:38,428 --> 01:06:40,914
How long to catch up?

800
01:06:41,014 --> 01:06:44,216
That depends on who's gonna last.

801
01:06:44,642 --> 01:06:46,343
Him or you?

802
01:07:58,550 --> 01:08:00,250
Will!

803
01:08:05,348 --> 01:08:07,174
Come back!

804
01:09:00,528 --> 01:09:03,021
Coley, don't do it!

805
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:44,479
Why did you do that?

806
01:09:45,823 --> 01:09:49,901
He draw on me first.
He was gonna shoot. Ask him.

807
01:09:52,705 --> 01:09:54,816
It's too bad.

808
01:09:54,916 --> 01:09:57,117
But he should've stayed behind.

809
01:09:58,544 --> 01:10:01,037
He didn't like me, that's why.

810
01:10:01,965 --> 01:10:04,875
He should've knowed
to not draw on me.

811
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:08,378
What are you doing?

812
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:45,493
I know that feeling, Gashade.

813
01:12:47,213 --> 01:12:49,456
I've carried the burden
of it longer than you.

814
01:12:53,386 --> 01:12:56,171
That would be your final
foolishness, you know.

815
01:13:00,977 --> 01:13:02,844
You hate me too?

816
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:54,104
Get down.

817
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:05,891
She's fallin'. She's fallin'!

818
01:14:08,628 --> 01:14:10,745
Can you see him?

819
01:14:11,047 --> 01:14:12,914
Makin' for that rise.

820
01:14:53,339 --> 01:14:55,324
Shoot him!

821
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:57,410
Come back and shoot him!

822
01:15:15,194 --> 01:15:17,395
Slow up, damn it!

823
01:15:20,533 --> 01:15:23,818
Remember, I got the water!
Don't forget!

824
01:20:15,578 --> 01:20:17,278
Coigne.
