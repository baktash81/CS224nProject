1
00:02:51,336 --> 00:02:53,293
Come for me!

2
00:03:25,575 --> 00:03:28,462
You're gaining on it, Johnny.

3
00:03:28,497 --> 00:03:31,333
Am I, father? Am I really?

4
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:34,375
Off you go now.
Run along and practice.

5
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,622
He'll make a good king.
He'll be ready.

6
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,387
That's the way.
Come on, my son!

7
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,289
Have you found religion, Henry?

8
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,329
Will you look down from heaven and
see who's sitting on your throne?

9
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:22,288
I must know before I die.

10
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:27,228
There's a legend of a king called
Lear, with whom I have a lot in common.

11
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:30,328
Both of us have kingdoms
and three children we adore,

12
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:33,088
and both of us are old,
but there it ends.

13
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:36,287
He cuts his kingdom into bits.
I can't do that.

14
00:04:36,328 --> 00:04:39,328
I've built an empire, and
I must know it's going to last.

15
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,287
All of Britain,
half of France...

16
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:45,287
I'm the greatest power in a thousand
years, and after me comes John.

17
00:04:52,244 --> 00:04:55,244
I'm going to lose you,
Henry, aren't I?

18
00:04:56,244 --> 00:04:59,202
Alais, in my time I've known...

19
00:04:59,244 --> 00:05:02,244
contessas, milkmaids,
courtesans...

20
00:05:02,286 --> 00:05:05,243
and novices,
whores, gypsies, jades...

21
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:08,201
and little boys,

22
00:05:08,243 --> 00:05:13,243
but nowhere in God's western world
have I found anyone to love but you.

23
00:05:14,243 --> 00:05:16,201
And Rosamund?

24
00:05:16,243 --> 00:05:19,742
- She's dead.
- And Eleanor.

25
00:05:19,784 --> 00:05:23,242
The new Medusa, my good wife?

26
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:27,242
How is your queen?
Decaying, I suppose.

27
00:05:27,284 --> 00:05:30,284
No, don't be jealous
of the Gorgon.

28
00:05:30,325 --> 00:05:33,240
She is not
among the things I love.

29
00:05:33,241 --> 00:05:37,240
How many husbands do you know
who dungeon up their wives?

30
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:43,241
I haven't kept the great bitch in the keep
for ten years out of passionate attachment.

31
00:05:43,283 --> 00:05:48,240
- There's Captain Marshal.
William!

32
00:05:50,198 --> 00:05:52,698
We will be holding
Christmas court at Chinon.

33
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,157
We have asked the king of France
to join us.

34
00:05:55,198 --> 00:06:00,198
I want Richard there and Geoffrey.
Go find my boys and tell them.

35
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,197
Then go fetch the queen
from Salisbury tower.

36
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:06,156
If the queen refuses?
Eleanor?

37
00:06:06,197 --> 00:06:09,197
She wouldn't miss this
for the world.

38
00:07:10,152 --> 00:07:12,110
Richard.

39
00:07:12,152 --> 00:07:14,110
Richard!

40
00:07:20,151 --> 00:07:24,109
Hello, Richard.

41
00:08:35,271 --> 00:08:37,062
Forward!

42
00:09:14,018 --> 00:09:15,351
Forward!

43
00:10:01,515 --> 00:10:03,515
Geoffrey?

44
00:10:05,015 --> 00:10:06,515
Geoffrey.

45
00:10:08,556 --> 00:10:10,972
Geoffrey!

46
00:10:11,014 --> 00:10:13,014
Father wants to see me.

47
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:40,013
Your majesty.

48
00:10:43,012 --> 00:10:46,012
There's to be
a Christmas court.

49
00:10:46,053 --> 00:10:48,095
Yes, madam.

50
00:10:48,137 --> 00:10:51,053
Where?
At Chinon.

51
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:59,215
Henry, what if, just for once,
I didn't do as I was told?

52
00:11:59,257 --> 00:12:01,881
It's going to be
a jungle of a day.

53
00:12:01,882 --> 00:12:04,215
If I start growling now,
I'll never last.

54
00:12:04,882 --> 00:12:06,257
You'll last.

55
00:12:06,882 --> 00:12:09,881
You're like the rocks at
stonehenge... nothing knocks you down.

56
00:12:15,256 --> 00:12:19,297
In these rooms, Alais, on this
Christmas, I have all the enemies I need.

57
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:23,296
You have more than you think.
Are you one?

58
00:12:23,338 --> 00:12:26,338
Has my willow
turned to poison oak?

59
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,880
If I decided to be trouble,
Henry, how much trouble could I be?

60
00:12:29,921 --> 00:12:32,338
Not much.

61
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:35,630
I could give away your plans.
You don't know what they are.

62
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,379
I know you want to disinherit
Richard. So does Eleanor.

63
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,337
She knows young Henry's dead.

64
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,379
The young king died in summer, and I haven't
named an heir. She knows I want John...

65
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,919
on the throne, and I know she wants
Richard... we are very frank about it.

66
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,837
Henry, I can't be your mistress
if I'm married to your son.

67
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:52,836
Why can't you?
Johnny wouldn't mind.

68
00:12:53,336 --> 00:12:55,586
I do not like your Johnny.
He's a good boy.

69
00:12:55,628 --> 00:12:57,711
He's got pimples,
and he smells of compost.

70
00:12:57,753 --> 00:12:59,836
He's just 16!
He can't help the pimples.

71
00:12:59,878 --> 00:13:03,378
He could have a bath!

72
00:13:03,836 --> 00:13:06,419
It isn't such a dreadful thing
to be queen of England.

73
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:08,418
Not all eyes will weep for you.

74
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,127
Will yours?
I don't know.

75
00:13:11,168 --> 00:13:13,793
Very likely.

76
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:17,627
All I want is not to lose you.
Can't you hide me?

77
00:13:17,668 --> 00:13:21,217
Can't I simply disappear?
You know you can't.

78
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:26,459
Your little brother Philip's king of France now,
and he wants your wedding or your dowry back.

79
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:29,792
I only took you for your
dowry. You were seven...

80
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:34,834
two big knees and two big eyes,
and that's all.

81
00:13:34,876 --> 00:13:36,833
How was I to know?

82
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,833
Hey. What's the matter, lad? Nothing.

83
00:14:05,498 --> 00:14:09,498
- Geoff!
- Johnny!

84
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:12,539
Is that for me?
I love Christmas.

85
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:20,747
What difference does
my dowry make?

86
00:14:20,788 --> 00:14:24,580
Let Philip have it back.
It isn't much. I can't.

87
00:14:24,788 --> 00:14:29,622
The vexin is a little county,
but it's vital to me. And I'm not.

88
00:14:29,788 --> 00:14:32,788
It's been my luck to fall
in love with landed women.

89
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,746
When I married Eleanor
I thought, "you lucky man.

90
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:38,662
"The richest woman in the
world... she owns the Aquitaine,

91
00:14:38,787 --> 00:14:42,662
the greatest province in the
continent, and beautiful as well."

92
00:14:43,787 --> 00:14:47,661
She was, you know.
And you adored her.

93
00:14:47,662 --> 00:14:52,620
Memory fails. There may
have been an era when I did.

94
00:14:52,703 --> 00:14:57,703
Let's have one strand askew. Nothing
in life has any business being perfect.

95
00:15:00,661 --> 00:15:04,660
If I say you and I are done,
we're done.

96
00:15:04,702 --> 00:15:08,702
If I say marry John, it's John.

97
00:15:08,744 --> 00:15:11,660
I'll have you by me,

98
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,660
and I'll use you as I like.

99
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:28,701
Ah, Christmas...
warm and rosy time.

100
00:15:28,743 --> 00:15:31,243
The hot wine steams,
the yule log roars,

101
00:15:31,284 --> 00:15:33,699
and we're the fat
that's in the fire.

102
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,699
She'll be here soon,
you know. Who? Mother.

103
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:40,741
She still want you to be king? We
are not as friendly as we used to be.

104
00:15:40,742 --> 00:15:42,700
If I'm supposed to make a fuss
and kiss her hairy cheek, I won't.

105
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,700
What you kiss,
little prince, is up to you.

106
00:15:46,742 --> 00:15:48,699
I'm father's favorite.
That's what counts.

107
00:15:48,741 --> 00:15:52,699
You hardly know me, Johnny, so I
beg you to believe my reputation.

108
00:15:52,741 --> 00:15:56,657
I am a constant soldier, a
sometime poet, and I will be king.

109
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:59,657
Just you remember...
father loves me best.

110
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:02,656
Why John? John doesn't
care for you at all.

111
00:16:03,656 --> 00:16:06,656
We love each other deeply. None
of them has any love for you.

112
00:16:06,698 --> 00:16:09,615
Because we fight?

113
00:16:09,656 --> 00:16:14,656
Tell me all three want the crown. I'll
tell you it's a feeble prince that doesn't.

114
00:16:14,698 --> 00:16:19,655
They may snap at me and plot, and that
makes them the kind of sons I want.

115
00:16:19,697 --> 00:16:22,614
I've snapped and plotted
all my life.

116
00:16:22,655 --> 00:16:26,655
There's no other way to be a
king, alive and 50 all at once.

117
00:16:26,697 --> 00:16:29,655
I'm going to fight for you.
Oh, fine.

118
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:43,520
How was your crossing?
Did the channel part for you?

119
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,520
It went flat when I told it to.

120
00:18:47,562 --> 00:18:50,479
I didn't think to ask for more.

121
00:18:57,562 --> 00:19:02,519
How dear of you to let me out of
jail. It's only for the holidays.

122
00:19:02,978 --> 00:19:08,478
Like school, you keep me young.
Here's gentle Alais.

123
00:19:09,561 --> 00:19:13,477
No, greet me as you used to.

124
00:19:14,477 --> 00:19:16,559
Fragile I am not.

125
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,477
Affection is a pressure
I can bear.

126
00:19:21,477 --> 00:19:25,477
Oh, but I do have
handsome children.

127
00:19:25,518 --> 00:19:29,434
John, you're so clean and neat.

128
00:19:29,476 --> 00:19:32,434
Henry takes good care of you.
And Richard.

129
00:19:32,476 --> 00:19:35,642
Don't look sullen, dear. It makes
your eyes go small and piggy...

130
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:38,684
and your chin look weak.

131
00:19:38,726 --> 00:19:41,434
Geoffrey.

132
00:19:41,476 --> 00:19:43,475
Is Philip here yet?
Not yet.

133
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,475
Let's hope he's
grown up like his father...

134
00:19:45,683 --> 00:19:48,683
Simon pure and Simon simple...
good, good, Louis.

135
00:19:48,725 --> 00:19:52,475
If I had managed sons for him
instead of all those little girls,

136
00:19:52,516 --> 00:19:54,725
I'd still be stuck
with being queen of France,

137
00:19:54,766 --> 00:19:57,432
and we should not have
known each other.

138
00:19:57,474 --> 00:20:00,765
Such, my angels,
is the role of sex in history.

139
00:20:02,765 --> 00:20:05,474
That will be Philip.

140
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:09,764
Where's Henry?
Upstairs with the family whore.

141
00:20:09,765 --> 00:20:13,473
That's a mean and tawdry way
to talk about your fiancee.

142
00:20:13,514 --> 00:20:15,763
My fiancee.
Whose ever fiancee.

143
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:18,306
I brought her up, and she
is dear to me and gentle.

144
00:20:18,348 --> 00:20:20,764
He still plans to make John
king. Of course he does.

145
00:20:20,806 --> 00:20:25,431
My, what a greedy little trinity
you are... king, king, king.

146
00:20:25,473 --> 00:20:28,472
Two of you must learn to live with
disappointment. Ah, but which two?

147
00:20:28,847 --> 00:20:30,805
Let's deny them all
and live forever.

148
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,847
Tusk to tusk
through all eternity.

149
00:20:35,472 --> 00:20:37,472
Ah, my boys.

150
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:40,887
The king of France and I will
shortly have a tactile conversation,

151
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:42,846
like two surgeons
looking for a lump.

152
00:20:42,887 --> 00:20:46,471
We'll state positions, and I'll make the first
of many offers. He'll refuse it, naturally.

153
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:49,429
I'll make a better one, and so on
through the holidays until I win.

154
00:20:49,846 --> 00:20:54,429
For the duration of this joyous ritual
you will give to your father your support.

155
00:21:44,425 --> 00:21:47,425
- My lord!
- Your grace!

156
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:50,967
Welcome to Chinon.

157
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:03,341
Ah, that's better.

158
00:22:07,382 --> 00:22:11,340
I was told you were impressive
for a boy of 17.

159
00:22:11,381 --> 00:22:15,048
- I'm Eleanor, who might have been your mother.
- Queen Eleanor.

160
00:22:15,381 --> 00:22:17,340
All the others here you know.

161
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:20,340
I gather you're disturbed
about your sister and her dowry.

162
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:23,339
Sixteen years ago
you made a treaty with us.

163
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,339
- It is time its terms were executed.
- I should think so.

164
00:22:26,714 --> 00:22:29,089
Our position comes to this:

165
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:32,630
That you will either hold the
marriage or return the vexin.

166
00:22:32,672 --> 00:22:36,130
Alais marries Richard, or we'll
have the county back at once.

167
00:22:36,172 --> 00:22:38,379
That's clear, concise
and well presented.

168
00:22:38,421 --> 00:22:41,129
My position...

169
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:43,338
well, frankly, Philip,
it's a tangle.

170
00:22:43,379 --> 00:22:46,379
Two years ago, the queen and I...
for reasons passing understanding...

171
00:22:46,421 --> 00:22:48,754
gave the Aquitaine to Richard.

172
00:22:48,796 --> 00:22:51,129
That makes Richard
very powerful.

173
00:22:51,296 --> 00:22:53,253
How can I give him Alais too?

174
00:22:53,295 --> 00:22:56,087
The man she marries
has you for an ally.

175
00:22:56,128 --> 00:23:00,170
It's their wedding or the vexin back.
Those are the terms you made with Louis.

176
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:03,128
True, but academic, lad.
The vexin's mine.

177
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:06,295
By what authority? It's got my troops
all over it. That makes it mine.

178
00:23:08,211 --> 00:23:10,169
Now, hear me, boy.

179
00:23:10,211 --> 00:23:14,252
I am a king. I am no man's boy. A king?

180
00:23:14,294 --> 00:23:17,211
Because you put your ass
on purple cushions?

181
00:23:17,294 --> 00:23:21,252
- Sir.
- Philip.

182
00:23:21,293 --> 00:23:24,293
You haven't got
the feel of this at all, lad.

183
00:23:24,335 --> 00:23:27,293
Use all your voices.
When I bellow, bellow back.

184
00:23:28,293 --> 00:23:33,292
I'll mark that down.
This too:

185
00:23:33,293 --> 00:23:35,251
We are the world in small.

186
00:23:35,293 --> 00:23:38,292
A nation is a human thing. It
does what we do, for our reasons.

187
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,292
Surely if we're civilized,
we can put away the knives.

188
00:23:41,334 --> 00:23:45,291
We can make peace.
We have it in our hands.

189
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:49,209
I've tutors of my own.
Will that be all? Oh, think.

190
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,170
You came here for a reason. Don't you
want to ask me if I've got an offer?

191
00:23:52,249 --> 00:23:54,369
Have you got an offer? Not
yet, but I'll think of one.

192
00:23:55,249 --> 00:23:57,249
Oh, by the way,

193
00:23:58,249 --> 00:24:01,249
you're better at this
than I thought you'd be.

194
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:04,249
I wasn't sure you'd noticed.

195
00:24:08,248 --> 00:24:12,207
Well, what shall we hang...
the holly or each other?

196
00:24:12,248 --> 00:24:17,248
Would you say, father, that I have
the makings of a king? A splendid king.

197
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,248
And would you expect me, father,
to give up without a fight?

198
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:22,206
Of course you'll fight.
I raised you to.

199
00:24:22,247 --> 00:24:25,247
I don't care what you offer Philip,
I don't care what plans you make.

200
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:28,247
I'll have the Aquitaine
and Alais and the crown.

201
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:30,206
I'll not give up one
to get the other.

202
00:24:30,247 --> 00:24:34,247
I won't trade off Alais or the
Aquitaine to that walking pustule!

203
00:24:36,246 --> 00:24:38,205
No, your loving son will not.

204
00:24:38,246 --> 00:24:41,205
Did you hear what he
called me? Clearly, dear.

205
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:45,246
Now, run along. It's nearly dinnertime.
I only do what father tells me.

206
00:24:45,288 --> 00:24:48,205
Go and eat.
Did I say something wrong?

207
00:24:48,246 --> 00:24:50,161
I'm always saying something
wrong. And don't pout.

208
00:24:50,162 --> 00:24:53,002
I'm not pouting. And stand up straight!
How often do I have to tell you?

209
00:24:55,162 --> 00:25:00,162
And that's to be the king.
And I'm to be his chancellor.

210
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,162
Has he told you?

211
00:25:03,037 --> 00:25:05,202
John will rule the country
while I run it, that is to say,

212
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,161
he gets to spend
the taxes that I raise.

213
00:25:07,203 --> 00:25:11,161
How nice for you. It's
not as nice as being king.

214
00:25:11,828 --> 00:25:13,828
We've made you duke of
brittany. Is that so little?

215
00:25:13,911 --> 00:25:19,201
No one ever thinks of crown
and mentions Geoff. Why is that?

216
00:25:19,202 --> 00:25:21,160
Isn't being chancellor
power enough?

217
00:25:21,202 --> 00:25:24,201
It's not the power I feel deprived
of. It's the mention I miss.

218
00:25:24,202 --> 00:25:27,160
There's no affection
for me here.

219
00:25:27,202 --> 00:25:29,160
You wouldn't think
I'd want that, would you?

220
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:38,159
Henry?
Hmm?

221
00:25:38,201 --> 00:25:40,159
I have a confession.
Yeah?

222
00:25:40,742 --> 00:25:45,159
- I don't much like
our children.

223
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:50,116
Only you... the child I raised but
didn't bear. You never cared for me.

224
00:25:50,158 --> 00:25:53,116
I did and do, believe me.
Henry's bed is Henry's province.

225
00:25:54,116 --> 00:25:57,116
He can people it with sheep
for all I care,

226
00:25:57,158 --> 00:25:59,075
which, on occasion,
he has done.

227
00:25:59,116 --> 00:26:02,075
Rosamund's been dead
for seven years.

228
00:26:02,116 --> 00:26:05,907
Two months and 18 days.
I never liked her much.

229
00:26:06,115 --> 00:26:09,115
- You count the days?
- I made the numbers up.

230
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,949
He found miss clifford
in the mists of wales...

231
00:26:12,115 --> 00:26:14,074
and brought her home
for closer observation.

232
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:17,572
Liking what he found,
he scrutinized her many years.

233
00:26:17,573 --> 00:26:20,948
He loved her deeply, and
she, him. And yet, my dear,

234
00:26:20,989 --> 00:26:25,114
when Henry had to choose
between his lady and my lands...

235
00:26:25,156 --> 00:26:30,031
there is no sport in
hurting me. It's so easy.

236
00:26:30,073 --> 00:26:32,988
After all the years
of loving care,

237
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:36,030
do you think I could
bring myself to hurt you?

238
00:26:36,113 --> 00:26:39,113
Eleanor, with both hands
tied behind you.

239
00:26:45,072 --> 00:26:47,112
She is lovely, isn't she?

240
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:54,071
Yes, very.

241
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:58,071
Who could I have chosen
to love...

242
00:26:58,112 --> 00:27:00,029
to gall you more?

243
00:27:00,071 --> 00:27:03,028
There's no one.

244
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:05,028
Time hasn't done a thing
but wrinkle you.

245
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:08,070
It hasn't even done that. I've
borne six girls, five boys...

246
00:27:08,111 --> 00:27:10,070
and 31 connubial years of you.

247
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:14,570
How am I possible? There
are moments when I miss you.

248
00:27:14,611 --> 00:27:18,069
Many? That's my wooly
sheepdog. Do you doubt it?

249
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:21,027
So, wee Johnny gets the crown.

250
00:27:21,069 --> 00:27:23,569
I've heard it rumored,
but I don't believe it.

251
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:26,819
Losing Alais will be hard,
for you do love her.

252
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,069
It's an old man's last
attachment, nothing more.

253
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:37,026
How hard do you find
living in your castle?

254
00:27:37,068 --> 00:27:40,568
It was difficult in the
beginning, but that's past.

255
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:44,068
I find I've seen
the world enough.

256
00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:46,067
I'll never let you loose.

257
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:48,982
You led too many
civil wars against me.

258
00:27:48,983 --> 00:27:53,983
And I damn near won the last one.
Still, as long as I get trotted out...

259
00:27:54,025 --> 00:27:56,983
for Christmas courts and
state occasions now and then...

260
00:27:58,983 --> 00:28:01,982
for I do like to see you...

261
00:28:02,024 --> 00:28:03,982
it's enough.

262
00:28:06,982 --> 00:28:08,982
I'm famished.
Let's go in to dinner.

263
00:28:09,024 --> 00:28:11,982
Arm in arm.
And hand in hand.

264
00:28:14,024 --> 00:28:18,022
You're still a marvel of a man.

265
00:28:18,023 --> 00:28:19,981
And you're my lady.

266
00:28:32,022 --> 00:28:33,980
It's an odd thing, Eleanor.

267
00:28:34,022 --> 00:28:36,980
I've fought and bargained
all these years...

268
00:28:37,022 --> 00:28:42,021
as if the only thing I had to live
for was what happened after I was dead.

269
00:28:42,022 --> 00:28:44,020
I've something else
to live for now.

270
00:28:44,021 --> 00:28:46,979
I've blundered onto peace.

271
00:28:48,021 --> 00:28:49,896
On Christmas eve.

272
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:54,938
Since Louis died, while Philip
grew, I've had no France to fight.

273
00:28:54,979 --> 00:28:57,938
In that lull, I've found how
good it is to write a law...

274
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:01,937
or make a tax more fair
or sit in judgment to decide...

275
00:29:02,937 --> 00:29:04,937
which peasant gets a cow.

276
00:29:05,937 --> 00:29:09,937
I tell you, there is nothing
more important in the world.

277
00:29:09,978 --> 00:29:13,936
Now the french boy's big enough,
and I'm sick of war.

278
00:29:18,936 --> 00:29:22,894
Do you still need
the vexin, Henry?

279
00:29:22,936 --> 00:29:25,936
It's as vital as it ever was. My troops
there are one day away from paris.

280
00:29:25,977 --> 00:29:28,935
That's a march of 20 miles.
I must keep it.

281
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,893
Henry, dear,

282
00:29:31,935 --> 00:29:35,935
if Alais does not marry Richard,
I will see you lose the vexin.

283
00:29:35,976 --> 00:29:38,935
Well, I thought
you'd never say it.

284
00:29:38,976 --> 00:29:41,975
I can do it.

285
00:29:42,017 --> 00:29:44,892
You can try.

286
00:29:44,934 --> 00:29:48,934
We have a pack of barons we
should look the loving couple for.

287
00:29:48,975 --> 00:29:51,934
Can you read love in that?

288
00:29:52,934 --> 00:29:55,934
And permanent affection.

289
00:30:14,932 --> 00:30:18,931
My Richard is the next king,
not your John.

290
00:30:18,932 --> 00:30:21,932
I know you, Henry. I know
every twist and bend you've got,

291
00:30:21,973 --> 00:30:24,932
and I'll be waiting
round each corner for you.

292
00:30:24,973 --> 00:30:27,472
Do you truly care who's king?

293
00:30:27,514 --> 00:30:29,931
I care because
you care so much.

294
00:30:29,972 --> 00:30:34,971
Don't fight me, Eleanor. What would you
have me do... give out, give up, give in?

295
00:30:34,972 --> 00:30:37,931
Give me a little peace.
A little?

296
00:30:37,972 --> 00:30:42,970
Why so modest? How about eternal
peace? Now, there's a thought.

297
00:30:42,971 --> 00:30:47,971
If you oppose me,
I'll strike you any way I can.

298
00:31:02,887 --> 00:31:05,845
Henry?
Madam?

299
00:31:05,887 --> 00:31:08,887
Did you ever love me?

300
00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:10,886
No.

301
00:31:11,886 --> 00:31:15,886
Good. That will
make this pleasanter.

302
00:32:28,214 --> 00:32:30,839
Well, I've come.
I'm here.

303
00:32:31,256 --> 00:32:35,214
What was it you wanted?
Just to talk.

304
00:32:35,256 --> 00:32:38,255
We haven't been alone,
the two of us, in...

305
00:32:38,297 --> 00:32:41,297
how long is it, lamb...
two years?

306
00:32:41,838 --> 00:32:43,797
You look fit.
War agrees with you.

307
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:47,838
I keep informed. I follow all
your slaughters from a distance.

308
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,713
Do sit down.

309
00:32:49,755 --> 00:32:53,254
Is this an audience, a good-night
hug with kisses or an ambush?

310
00:32:54,254 --> 00:32:56,504
Let's hope it's a reunion.

311
00:32:56,546 --> 00:32:58,712
Must you look so stern?

312
00:32:58,754 --> 00:33:01,296
I sent for you to say
I want your love again,

313
00:33:01,337 --> 00:33:03,712
but I can't say it
to a face like that.

314
00:33:03,754 --> 00:33:06,754
My love, of all things.
What would you want it for?

315
00:33:07,295 --> 00:33:10,753
Why, for itself. What
other purpose could I have?

316
00:33:10,795 --> 00:33:14,295
You will tell me
when you're ready to.

317
00:33:14,336 --> 00:33:17,753
I scheme a lot, I know.
I plot and plan.

318
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:22,377
That's how a queen
in prison spends her time.

319
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:24,751
But there is more to me
than that.

320
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:28,377
Can't I say I love a son
and be believed?

321
00:33:31,419 --> 00:33:34,377
If I were you,
I'd try another tack.

322
00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:38,418
I've no dammed up floods of passion for
you. There's no chance I'll overflow.

323
00:33:38,459 --> 00:33:42,751
You're a dull boy, dull as plainsong.
La-la-la, forever on one note.

324
00:33:43,001 --> 00:33:47,458
I gave the church up out of
boredom. I can do as much for you.

325
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:50,668
You'll never give me up,
not while I hold the Aquitaine.

326
00:33:50,708 --> 00:33:55,708
You think I'm motivated by love of hills
and dales? I think you want it back.

327
00:33:56,417 --> 00:33:59,708
You're so deceitful, you can't
ask for water when you're thirsty.

328
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:03,708
We could tangle spiders
in the webs you weave.

329
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,623
If I'm so devious,
why don't you go?

330
00:34:06,624 --> 00:34:09,457
Don't stand there
quivering in limbo.

331
00:34:09,707 --> 00:34:13,457
Love me, little lamb,
or leave me.

332
00:34:14,707 --> 00:34:17,123
Leave you, madam?

333
00:34:17,124 --> 00:34:19,499
With pure joy.

334
00:34:21,706 --> 00:34:26,498
Departure's a simple act. You put the
left foot down, and then the right.

335
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,498
Mother! Hush, dear. Mother's fighting.

336
00:34:28,706 --> 00:34:32,540
Father's finished working out
the treaty terms.

337
00:34:32,581 --> 00:34:36,539
How nice.
Where is your father?

338
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:41,664
Ah, there you are.

339
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:43,664
Well, have you
put the terms to Philip?

340
00:34:43,705 --> 00:34:47,705
Not yet, but we're shortly granting him
an audience. I hope you'll all attend.

341
00:34:49,663 --> 00:34:52,621
Are we to know the terms,
or would you rather tease us?

342
00:34:52,663 --> 00:34:56,162
Not at all. The terms are... what are
you giving to Philip, what of mine?

343
00:34:56,163 --> 00:34:59,662
Whatever you've got goes to me. And
what's the nothing Geoffrey gets?

344
00:34:59,663 --> 00:35:02,663
My God, boys,
you can't all three be king.

345
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:05,662
All three of us can try.
That's pointless now.

346
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:08,620
I want you to succeed me,
Richard.

347
00:35:08,662 --> 00:35:11,620
Alais and the crown...
I give you both.

348
00:35:12,662 --> 00:35:14,662
I've no sense of humor.
If I did, I'd laugh.

349
00:35:14,703 --> 00:35:18,619
- I mean to do it.
- What about me?

350
00:35:18,661 --> 00:35:20,660
I'm your favorite.
I'm the one you love.

351
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:22,619
I'm sorry, John.
I can't help myself.

352
00:35:22,911 --> 00:35:26,661
Could you keep anything I gave you?
Could you beat him in the field?

353
00:35:26,702 --> 00:35:28,619
You could.
John, I won't be there.

354
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:32,661
I'm losing too.
All my dreams for you are lost.

355
00:35:32,702 --> 00:35:34,618
You've led me on.
I never meant to.

356
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,660
You're a failure as a father.
You know that? I'm sorry, Johnny.

357
00:35:37,701 --> 00:35:40,660
Not yet, but I'll do something
terrible, and you'll be sorry then.

358
00:35:40,701 --> 00:35:45,660
Did you rehearse all this,
or are you improvising?

359
00:35:45,701 --> 00:35:47,618
Good God, woman,
face the facts.

360
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,575
Which ones?
We have so many.

361
00:35:50,117 --> 00:35:52,534
Power is the only fact.

362
00:35:52,575 --> 00:35:55,534
How could I keep him
from the throne?

363
00:35:55,575 --> 00:35:57,575
He'd only take it
if I didn't give it to him.

364
00:35:57,617 --> 00:35:59,534
No, you'd make me fight for it.

365
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:02,574
I know you. You'd never give me
anything. True, and I haven't.

366
00:36:02,616 --> 00:36:05,574
You get Alais and the kingdom,
but I get the thing I want most:

367
00:36:05,616 --> 00:36:08,574
If you're king, England
stays intact. I get that.

368
00:36:09,449 --> 00:36:12,574
It's all yours now... the crown,
the girl, the whole black business.

369
00:36:12,616 --> 00:36:14,574
Isn't that enough?

370
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:19,572
I don't know
who's to be congratulated.

371
00:36:19,573 --> 00:36:23,573
Kings, Queens, knights everywhere
you look, and I'm the only pawn.

372
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:28,573
I haven't got a thing to lose.
That makes me dangerous.

373
00:36:30,573 --> 00:36:32,571
- Poor child.
- Poor John.

374
00:36:32,572 --> 00:36:37,571
Who says, "poor John"?
Don't everybody sob at once.

375
00:36:37,572 --> 00:36:39,932
My God, if I went up in flames,
there's not a living soul...

376
00:36:40,572 --> 00:36:42,572
who'd pee on me
to put the fire out.

377
00:36:42,614 --> 00:36:46,571
Let's strike a flint and see.

378
00:36:46,613 --> 00:36:50,070
You're everything a little
brother dreams of, you know that?

379
00:36:50,071 --> 00:36:53,530
- I used to dream about you all the time.
- Ah, Johnny.

380
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:58,530
I'll show you, Eleanor.
I've not lost yet.

381
00:37:04,529 --> 00:37:08,529
Well, mummy,
if you want me, here I am.

382
00:37:10,529 --> 00:37:15,529
John's lost his chancellor,
has he? And you've gained one.

383
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:19,486
It's a bitter thing
your mummy has to say.

384
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:23,528
She doesn't trust me. You must
know Henry isn't through with John.

385
00:37:23,569 --> 00:37:27,486
He'll keep the vexin till
the moon goes blue from cold.

386
00:37:27,528 --> 00:37:31,527
And as for Richard's wedding day...
we'll see the second coming first.

387
00:37:31,568 --> 00:37:34,527
The needlework alone can
last for years.

388
00:37:34,568 --> 00:37:36,485
I know.

389
00:37:36,527 --> 00:37:38,485
You know I know.

390
00:37:38,527 --> 00:37:41,485
I know you know I know.

391
00:37:41,527 --> 00:37:46,526
We know Henry knows,
and Henry knows we know it.

392
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:48,442
We're a knowledgeable family.

393
00:37:48,484 --> 00:37:51,442
Will Richard take me
for his chancellor or won't he?

394
00:37:53,484 --> 00:37:55,442
Why are you dropping John?

395
00:37:55,484 --> 00:38:00,482
Because you're going to win. You will,
with me to help you. I haven't yet.

396
00:38:00,483 --> 00:38:03,441
I can handle John. He'll
swallow anything I tell him.

397
00:38:03,483 --> 00:38:06,482
I'll take him by the hand and
walk him into the trap you set.

398
00:38:06,483 --> 00:38:08,441
You're good.
You're first class, Geoff.

399
00:38:08,483 --> 00:38:11,441
You'd sell John out to me,
or me to John, or...

400
00:38:11,483 --> 00:38:16,482
you can tell me... have you found some
way of selling everyone to everybody?

401
00:38:16,524 --> 00:38:18,482
Not yet, mummy,
but I'm working on it.

402
00:38:19,482 --> 00:38:23,440
I don't care who's king,
but you and Henry do.

403
00:38:23,482 --> 00:38:26,482
I want to watch the two of you
go picnicking on one another.

404
00:38:27,524 --> 00:38:30,439
You have a gift for hating.

405
00:38:30,481 --> 00:38:33,439
You're the expert.
You should know.

406
00:38:33,523 --> 00:38:36,439
Dear lord.

407
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:39,439
You've loved me
all these years.

408
00:38:39,481 --> 00:38:44,563
Oh, God forgive me. I've upset
the queen. We need you. Help us.

409
00:38:44,605 --> 00:38:46,563
What... and miss the fun
of selling you?

410
00:38:46,605 --> 00:38:49,397
Be Richard's chancellor.

411
00:38:52,397 --> 00:38:54,397
Rot.

412
00:39:00,396 --> 00:39:03,396
Well, that's how
deals are made.

413
00:39:04,396 --> 00:39:07,020
We've got him if we want him.

414
00:39:07,021 --> 00:39:09,604
He'll sell us all, you know,

415
00:39:10,396 --> 00:39:12,604
but only if he thinks
we think he won't.

416
00:39:14,395 --> 00:39:18,395
Why did I have to have
such clever children?

417
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:27,394
What's the matter, Richard? Nothing.

418
00:39:27,435 --> 00:39:30,393
It's a heavy thing,
your nothing.

419
00:39:30,394 --> 00:39:33,394
When I write or send for you
or speak or reach,

420
00:39:33,435 --> 00:39:37,394
your nothings come,
like stones.

421
00:39:37,435 --> 00:39:39,685
Don't play a scene with me.

422
00:39:39,727 --> 00:39:43,393
I wouldn't if I could.
I'm simpler than I used to be.

423
00:39:43,726 --> 00:39:45,393
I had, at one time,
many appetites.

424
00:39:45,726 --> 00:39:49,393
I wanted poetry and power and the
young men who create them both.

425
00:39:49,726 --> 00:39:52,726
I even wanted Henry, too,
in those days.

426
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:57,391
Now I've only one desire left...
to see you king.

427
00:39:57,392 --> 00:40:00,432
The only thing you want to see is
father's vitals on a bed of lettuce.

428
00:40:00,433 --> 00:40:03,432
You don't care who wins, as long
as Henry loses. You'd do anything.

429
00:40:03,433 --> 00:40:05,392
You are Medea to the teeth,

430
00:40:05,433 --> 00:40:09,392
only this is one son you won't use
for vengeance against your husband.

431
00:40:11,432 --> 00:40:13,391
How my captivity has
changed you.

432
00:40:14,807 --> 00:40:19,391
Henry meant to hurt me.
He's hacked you up instead.

433
00:40:21,849 --> 00:40:24,849
Men coveted this talon once.

434
00:40:25,432 --> 00:40:28,848
Henry was 18 when we met,
and I was queen of France.

435
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:32,430
He came down from the north to
Paris with a mind like Aristotle's...

436
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:36,390
and a form like mortal sin.

437
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:39,890
We shattered the commandments
on the spot.

438
00:40:39,931 --> 00:40:43,930
I spent three months annulling
Louis, then in may, in spring,

439
00:40:43,972 --> 00:40:46,639
not far from here,
we married...

440
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,347
young count Henry
and his countess.

441
00:40:49,889 --> 00:40:55,346
But in three years' time I was his
queen, and he was king of England.

442
00:40:55,388 --> 00:41:01,304
Done at 21... five years
your junior, general.

443
00:41:01,346 --> 00:41:06,346
I can count. There was no Thomas
Beckett then, or Rosamund...

444
00:41:06,388 --> 00:41:09,928
no rivals, only me.

445
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:14,137
And then young Henry came,
and you...

446
00:41:14,178 --> 00:41:18,303
and all the other blossoms
in my garden.

447
00:41:18,345 --> 00:41:23,345
Yes. Had I been sterile,
darling, I'd be happier today.

448
00:41:23,387 --> 00:41:25,969
Is that designed to hurt me?
What a waste.

449
00:41:26,344 --> 00:41:29,011
I've fought with Henry over who
comes next, whose dawn it is...

450
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:32,344
and which son gets the sunset,
and we'll never live to see it.

451
00:41:34,011 --> 00:41:36,011
Look at you.

452
00:41:36,344 --> 00:41:39,342
I loved you more than Henry,

453
00:41:39,343 --> 00:41:42,051
and it's cost me everything.
What do you want?

454
00:41:43,343 --> 00:41:47,343
I want us back the way we
were. No, that's not it.

455
00:41:47,385 --> 00:41:50,301
All right, then.
I want the Aquitaine.

456
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:55,259
That's the mother I remember.
We can win. I can get you Alais.

457
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:59,050
I can make the marriage happen, but
I've got to have the Aquitaine to do it.

458
00:41:59,092 --> 00:42:01,967
I must have it back. It's
mine, and I'll never give it up.

459
00:42:02,217 --> 00:42:06,009
Shall I write my will,
"to Richard... everything"?

460
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:10,091
Would you believe me then?
Where's paper? Paper burns.

461
00:42:12,299 --> 00:42:14,258
I love you.

462
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:16,966
You love nothing.

463
00:42:17,008 --> 00:42:20,966
You're incomplete. The human
parts of you are missing.

464
00:42:21,299 --> 00:42:25,047
You're as dead
as you are deadly.

465
00:42:25,048 --> 00:42:27,298
Don't leave me.

466
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,172
You were lovely once.

467
00:42:33,173 --> 00:42:35,298
I've seen the pictures.

468
00:42:36,048 --> 00:42:38,881
Don't you remember
how you loved me?

469
00:42:39,172 --> 00:42:42,256
We were always hand in hand.

470
00:42:42,297 --> 00:42:46,672
Here's how it felt.
As hot and coarse as that?

471
00:42:46,714 --> 00:42:51,047
This won't burn.
I'll scratch a will on this.

472
00:42:51,214 --> 00:42:53,213
"To Richard... everything."

473
00:42:53,255 --> 00:42:55,213
Mother!

474
00:42:58,213 --> 00:43:01,046
Remember how I
taught you numbers...

475
00:43:01,088 --> 00:43:04,088
and the lute and poetry?

476
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:07,045
See? You do remember.

477
00:43:07,087 --> 00:43:10,212
I taught you dancing, too,
and languages...

478
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:14,212
and all the music I knew and
how to love what's beautiful.

479
00:43:15,129 --> 00:43:20,212
The sun was warmer then,
and we were every day together.

480
00:43:48,168 --> 00:43:53,167
William, tell the french king
I'll see him in the parlor.

481
00:43:53,209 --> 00:43:55,167
Yes, my lord.
In half an hour.

482
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:58,167
Half an hour. Good.

483
00:44:04,167 --> 00:44:08,166
Of course, you know there's not
a word of truth to Henry's terms.

484
00:44:09,166 --> 00:44:11,166
If that's a warning, thank you.

485
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:14,166
What if it's an offer?

486
00:44:15,166 --> 00:44:17,666
"What if" is
a game for scholars.

487
00:44:17,708 --> 00:44:20,165
What if angels sat on pinheads?

488
00:44:23,165 --> 00:44:25,665
What if I were king?

489
00:44:25,707 --> 00:44:28,165
It's your game, Geoff.

490
00:44:29,165 --> 00:44:31,165
You play it.

491
00:44:46,164 --> 00:44:48,123
John.

492
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:54,080
I made this for father.
All the pieces work.

493
00:44:54,122 --> 00:44:57,122
It took months. I'm not a fool.
I know. Now, here's my plan.

494
00:44:57,163 --> 00:45:01,122
I read three languages.
I've studied law.

495
00:45:01,163 --> 00:45:03,080
What plan?

496
00:45:03,122 --> 00:45:05,121
We've got to make a
deal with Philip. Why?

497
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:09,079
Because you're out, and Richard's
in. And what kind of deal?

498
00:45:09,121 --> 00:45:14,121
A war. If we three join and fight
now, we can finish Richard off.

499
00:45:14,162 --> 00:45:17,121
You mean destroy him?
Hmm.

500
00:45:18,121 --> 00:45:20,120
And mother too?

501
00:45:20,161 --> 00:45:22,078
And mother too.

502
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:25,620
Now, do we do it? Is it
on? I've got to think.

503
00:45:25,661 --> 00:45:29,120
You haven't time.
We are extra princes now.

504
00:45:29,161 --> 00:45:31,120
You know where
extra princes go?

505
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:36,119
Down.

506
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,119
Well, does John want a war
or doesn't he?

507
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:45,119
Do you? If John asks for your
soldiers, will he get them?

508
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,033
If John wants a war,
he's got one.

509
00:45:48,034 --> 00:45:51,033
John, you hear that?
I'm still thinking.

510
00:45:51,034 --> 00:45:55,034
Let me help. It's either
Richard on the throne or you.

511
00:45:57,034 --> 00:46:00,034
Do you think we'd win?

512
00:46:02,034 --> 00:46:04,033
I know it.

513
00:46:18,074 --> 00:46:21,032
Henry!

514
00:46:21,741 --> 00:46:26,406
But you don't understand. I would
appreciate a little quiet confidence.

515
00:46:26,407 --> 00:46:31,073
I've enough nits picking at me.
But you've promised me to Richard!

516
00:46:31,074 --> 00:46:34,031
Good God,
you don't think I meant it?

517
00:46:34,073 --> 00:46:37,031
So that whole scene,
all you said to John...

518
00:46:37,073 --> 00:46:41,072
you think I'd ever give him up when I've
mothered him and fathered him and babied him?

519
00:46:41,073 --> 00:46:45,072
He's all I've got! How often do you
people have to hear it... every supper?

520
00:46:45,073 --> 00:46:47,071
Should we start the soup with
who we love and who we don't?

521
00:46:47,072 --> 00:46:48,989
I think you like passing me
from hand to hand.

522
00:46:49,989 --> 00:46:51,989
What am I to you...
a collection plate?

523
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:53,947
Or am I all you've got,
like John?

524
00:46:53,989 --> 00:46:56,947
I've got to get
the Aquitaine for John.

525
00:46:56,989 --> 00:47:01,946
- I talk people, and you answer back in provinces!
- They get mixed up.

526
00:47:01,988 --> 00:47:03,988
What's the Aquitaine to Eleanor? It's
not a province. It's a way to torture me.

527
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:08,488
That's why she spent the evening
wooing Richard, wheezing on the coals.

528
00:47:08,529 --> 00:47:11,988
She'll squeeze it out of him. My
God, I'd have loved to eavesdrop.

529
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:16,028
"I taught you prancing, lamb,
and lute and flute..."

530
00:47:16,987 --> 00:47:20,028
That's marvelous.

531
00:47:20,987 --> 00:47:22,070
It's absolutely me.

532
00:47:22,987 --> 00:47:25,987
I thought as long as I was
coming down, I'd bring them.

533
00:47:26,028 --> 00:47:28,028
Whatever are you giving me?

534
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:30,070
You're such a child.
You always ask.

535
00:47:30,986 --> 00:47:32,986
"To Henry."

536
00:47:33,027 --> 00:47:34,944
Heavy.

537
00:47:34,986 --> 00:47:37,986
It's my tombstone!
Eleanor, you spoil me.

538
00:47:38,027 --> 00:47:39,986
I never could
deny you anything.

539
00:47:40,111 --> 00:47:44,569
Don't go. It nettles her
to see how much I need you.

540
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:49,068
You need me, Henry, like a
tailor needs a tinker's dam.

541
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:52,901
Oh, I know that look.

542
00:47:52,943 --> 00:47:54,943
He's going to say he loves me.

543
00:47:54,985 --> 00:47:57,110
Like my life.

544
00:48:01,942 --> 00:48:04,900
I talk that way
to keep her spirits up.

545
00:48:04,942 --> 00:48:08,942
Well, how'd you do with
Richard? Did you break his heart?

546
00:48:08,984 --> 00:48:11,900
You think he ought to
give me back the Aquitaine?

547
00:48:11,942 --> 00:48:15,149
I can't see why he shouldn't. After
all, I've promised him the throne.

548
00:48:15,941 --> 00:48:20,148
The boy keeps wondering
if your promises are any good.

549
00:48:20,149 --> 00:48:24,191
There's no sense asking if the air's
good when there's nothing else to breathe.

550
00:48:24,233 --> 00:48:26,941
Exactly what I told him.

551
00:48:27,191 --> 00:48:31,940
Have you got it?
Will he give it back?

552
00:48:31,982 --> 00:48:34,940
No Aquitaine for John.

553
00:48:41,232 --> 00:48:45,897
I have to give him something.
Isn't some agreement possible?

554
00:48:45,939 --> 00:48:50,189
Love, in a world where carpenters
get resurrected, anything is possible.

555
00:48:50,231 --> 00:48:53,564
You bore him, damn it.
He's your son!

556
00:48:53,606 --> 00:48:56,856
Oh, heavens, yes.
280 days I bore him.

557
00:48:56,897 --> 00:48:59,188
I recall them all.

558
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:01,854
You'd only just found Rosamund.

559
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:05,855
Why her so damn particularly?
I've found other women.

560
00:49:07,271 --> 00:49:09,271
Countless others.

561
00:49:09,855 --> 00:49:11,271
What's your count?

562
00:49:11,855 --> 00:49:15,312
Let's have a tally of the
bedspreads you've spread out on.

563
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:20,854
Thomas Beckett's.
That's a lie.

564
00:49:21,895 --> 00:49:27,312
I know.
You still care what I do.

565
00:49:27,354 --> 00:49:30,353
I want the Aquitaine for John!
I want it, and I'll have it.

566
00:49:30,394 --> 00:49:33,353
Is that menace you're
conveying? Is it to be torture?

567
00:49:33,894 --> 00:49:37,893
Will you boil me or stretch me...
which? Or am I to be perforated?

568
00:49:37,894 --> 00:49:40,353
I have the documents,
and you will sign.

569
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:44,393
How will you force me to... threats?
"Sign or I refuse to feed you."

570
00:49:44,435 --> 00:49:49,852
Tears? "Oh, sign before
my heart goes crack."

571
00:49:49,893 --> 00:49:53,852
I'm like the earth, old man...
there isn't any way around me.

572
00:49:54,435 --> 00:49:55,893
I adore you.

573
00:49:56,435 --> 00:49:59,434
Save your aching arches.
That road's closed.

574
00:50:00,892 --> 00:50:02,892
I have an offer for you,
my dear.

575
00:50:02,934 --> 00:50:05,434
A deal? A deal?

576
00:50:05,476 --> 00:50:10,476
I give the richest province on
the continent to John for what?

577
00:50:10,892 --> 00:50:14,516
You tell me,
mastermind, for what.

578
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:19,850
Your freedom.

579
00:50:26,557 --> 00:50:28,890
Oh.

580
00:50:29,557 --> 00:50:31,997
Once Johnny gets the Aquitaine,
you're free. I'll let you out.

581
00:50:32,015 --> 00:50:35,849
Think: On the loose in london,
winters in provence,

582
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:38,890
impromptu trips to visit Richard
anywhere he's killing people...

583
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:43,848
all that for a signature.

584
00:50:43,889 --> 00:50:48,806
- You're good.
- I thought it might appeal. You always fancied traveling.

585
00:50:48,848 --> 00:50:50,764
Yes.

586
00:50:50,806 --> 00:50:54,806
I even made poor Louis
take me on crusade.

587
00:50:54,848 --> 00:50:57,555
How's that for blasphemy?

588
00:50:57,597 --> 00:51:02,805
I dressed my maids as amazons and
rode bare-breasted halfway to damascus.

589
00:51:02,847 --> 00:51:05,805
Louis had a seizure, and I
damn near died of windburn,

590
00:51:10,804 --> 00:51:13,637
but the troops were dazzled.

591
00:51:18,637 --> 00:51:20,804
Henry, I'm against the wall.

592
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:25,678
To be a prisoner...

593
00:51:26,678 --> 00:51:28,803
to be bricked in...

594
00:51:29,803 --> 00:51:31,803
when you've known the world...

595
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,803
I'll never know how I survived.

596
00:51:39,719 --> 00:51:44,760
These ten years, Henry,
have been unimaginable.

597
00:51:46,844 --> 00:51:48,760
And now,

598
00:51:51,677 --> 00:51:54,759
you offer me
the only thing I want...

599
00:51:54,801 --> 00:51:57,676
if I give up...

600
00:51:57,718 --> 00:51:59,759
the only thing I treasure.

601
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:04,718
Sign the paper, and we'll
break the happy news.

602
00:52:04,759 --> 00:52:08,758
The queen is free, John gets the
Aquitaine, and Richard marries Alais.

603
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,758
Yes, let's have it done.

604
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,758
I'll sign.

605
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:19,717
On one condition.
Name it.

606
00:52:19,758 --> 00:52:23,716
Have the wedding now.
What's that?

607
00:52:23,757 --> 00:52:27,716
Why, I've surprised you.
Surely it's not sudden.

608
00:52:27,757 --> 00:52:31,757
They've been marching down the aisle
for 16 years, and that's a long walk.

609
00:52:31,799 --> 00:52:35,716
John can be best man.
That's a laugh.

610
00:52:35,757 --> 00:52:39,756
And you can give the bride
away. I want to watch you do it.

611
00:52:39,798 --> 00:52:44,715
Alais...
I can live without her.

612
00:52:44,756 --> 00:52:46,715
And I thought you loved her. So I do.

613
00:52:46,756 --> 00:52:50,714
Thank God. You frightened me.
I was afraid this wouldn't hurt.

614
00:52:50,715 --> 00:52:53,672
What a tragedy you are.

615
00:52:55,714 --> 00:53:00,672
I wonder...
do you ever wonder...

616
00:53:01,714 --> 00:53:04,672
if I slept with your father?

617
00:53:08,713 --> 00:53:12,212
My father?
It's a lie.

618
00:53:12,213 --> 00:53:15,671
But there are rumors.

619
00:53:16,713 --> 00:53:18,671
Don't you ever wonder?

620
00:53:18,713 --> 00:53:21,670
Is it rich, despising
me? Is it rewarding? No.

621
00:53:22,212 --> 00:53:24,670
Then stop!
How?

622
00:53:24,712 --> 00:53:26,670
It's what I live for.
I'll show you.

623
00:53:27,503 --> 00:53:29,670
By christ, I will.
I'll do it.

624
00:53:29,712 --> 00:53:33,420
Where's a priest?
Somebody dig me up a priest!

625
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:37,669
You!
Fetch me a bishop!

626
00:53:37,711 --> 00:53:40,669
Get old Durham.
He's just down the hall.

627
00:53:40,711 --> 00:53:44,711
Ask him to meet us in the
chapel. John, Richard, Geoffrey!

628
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:20,624
What's wrong? What's happened?
Richard's getting married.

629
00:54:20,666 --> 00:54:25,623
Getting married? Now?
He's getting married now?

630
00:54:25,624 --> 00:54:27,624
I never cease to marvel at
the quickness of your mind.

631
00:54:27,666 --> 00:54:30,623
You can't hurt me,
you bag of bile.

632
00:54:30,624 --> 00:54:32,623
But you can, father.
Why? Because I say so.

633
00:54:32,624 --> 00:54:36,623
My lord, the bishop's waiting in the
chapel. Good. Let's get this over with.

634
00:54:36,665 --> 00:54:39,622
You'll make a lovely bride.
I wonder if I'll cry.

635
00:54:39,623 --> 00:54:42,622
You sound as if you think
it's going to happen. I do.

636
00:54:42,623 --> 00:54:44,864
He's only plotting. Can't you
tell when Henry's plotting?

637
00:54:45,623 --> 00:54:47,622
Not this time.
He'll never give me up.

638
00:54:47,623 --> 00:54:49,539
You think I won't?
Because you told me so.

639
00:54:49,581 --> 00:54:52,581
You're not my helen. I won't fight
a war to save a face. We're done.

640
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,581
I don't believe you!
Wait ten minutes!

641
00:54:58,581 --> 00:55:02,581
Please! Richard, Richard,
we're not...

642
00:55:02,622 --> 00:55:04,580
honestly, we're not!

643
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:10,580
Please!
We love each other.

644
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:18,580
Come on! It's lunacy!
I won't do it! I won't!

645
00:55:19,579 --> 00:55:23,579
- Lunacy! Let me go, Henry. Richard, no!
- Come on!

646
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:26,579
I won't say the words!
Not one of them!

647
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:29,579
It makes no sense!
Why give me up?

648
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:32,579
What do you get?
What are you gaining?

649
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:35,619
Why, the Aquitaine, of course.

650
00:55:35,661 --> 00:55:37,578
What's that again?

651
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:40,578
Your mother gets her freedom,
and I get the Aquitaine.

652
00:55:40,619 --> 00:55:42,578
That is the proposition,
isn't it? You did agree.

653
00:55:42,619 --> 00:55:45,619
Of course she did. I knew it. It
was all pretense. I believed it all.

654
00:55:46,328 --> 00:55:49,534
I meant it all. No wedding.
There'll be no wedding.

655
00:55:49,535 --> 00:55:52,493
But, my boy, look.
Durham's waiting.

656
00:55:52,535 --> 00:55:55,577
Marry her, for my sake. It
isn't much to ask. Never!

657
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:58,577
But I promised it to Philip.
Think of my position.

658
00:55:58,618 --> 00:56:01,618
Damn the wedding and to hell with
your position. You don't dare defy me.

659
00:56:02,535 --> 00:56:04,492
Don't I?

660
00:56:04,659 --> 00:56:08,533
You're the king of France, for
God's sake. Speak up. Do something.

661
00:56:08,534 --> 00:56:10,659
Make a threat. Come on,
frighten me. Am I? Dunce!

662
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:14,492
He never meant
to have the wedding.

663
00:56:14,534 --> 00:56:18,532
Come again. You're good at
rage. I like the way you play it.

664
00:56:18,533 --> 00:56:21,491
Boy, don't ever call a king
a liar to his face.

665
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:25,699
I'm not a boy...
to you or anyone!

666
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:28,533
Boy, you came here asking
for a wedding or the vexin back.

667
00:56:28,741 --> 00:56:32,699
By God, you don't get either. It's no
to both. You have a pact with France!

668
00:56:33,115 --> 00:56:36,532
Then damn the pact and damn France.
She never marries, not while I'm alive.

669
00:56:36,574 --> 00:56:39,490
Your life and never
are two different times.

670
00:56:39,532 --> 00:56:44,490
Not on my clock, boy!
Listen to the lion!

671
00:56:44,532 --> 00:56:48,448
Come on, frighten me. Don't spoil it,
Richard. Take it like a good sport.

672
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:50,406
How's your bad leg?
Better, thank you.

673
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:53,738
Your bad back? You're getting
old. You'll have me once too often.

674
00:56:53,739 --> 00:56:57,448
When? I'm 50 now. My God,
boy, I'm the oldest man I know.

675
00:56:57,489 --> 00:56:59,448
I've got a decade on the pope.

676
00:57:02,738 --> 00:57:05,738
What's it to be? The
broadsword when I'm 85?

677
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:09,447
I'm not a second son now. Your
Henry's lies in the vault, you know.

678
00:57:09,488 --> 00:57:13,405
I know.
I've seen him there.

679
00:57:13,447 --> 00:57:15,822
I'll have the crown. You'll
have what daddy gives you.

680
00:57:15,862 --> 00:57:19,445
I am next in line!
To nothing!

681
00:57:19,446 --> 00:57:21,446
Then we'll only have the
broadswords now. This minute?

682
00:57:21,487 --> 00:57:23,445
No, on the battlefield!
So we're at war?

683
00:57:23,446 --> 00:57:26,154
Yes, we're at war. I have 2,000
men at Poitiers. Can they hear you?

684
00:57:26,196 --> 00:57:28,877
Call and see who answers. You're
as close to Poitiers as you'll get.

685
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:33,945
You don't dare hold me prisoner. Until we're
all agreed John comes next, I can and will.

686
00:57:33,986 --> 00:57:38,445
You're a king's son, so I treat you with respect.
You have the freedom of the castle.

687
00:57:38,486 --> 00:57:40,903
The castle doesn't stand that
holds me. Post your guards.

688
00:57:42,903 --> 00:57:46,444
My God, I'm king again.
Fantastic.

689
00:57:46,694 --> 00:57:50,402
Are you happy for me, Geoff?
I'm happy for us both.

690
00:58:03,193 --> 00:58:05,943
You played it nicely.
You were good.

691
00:58:06,401 --> 00:58:11,193
Yes, I was.
I fooled you, didn't I?

692
00:58:11,234 --> 00:58:15,982
Oh, God, but I do love
being king.

693
00:58:15,983 --> 00:58:17,942
Well, Henry,

694
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,191
liege and lord,

695
00:58:21,192 --> 00:58:23,942
what happens now?

696
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,983
I've no idea.

697
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,399
I know I'm winning, and I know I'll
win, but what the next move is...

698
00:58:35,024 --> 00:58:37,399
you were scared, weren't you?

699
00:58:39,024 --> 00:58:41,399
No.

700
00:58:44,023 --> 00:58:45,398
I think you were.

701
00:58:46,065 --> 00:58:50,981
I was. You mustn't play with
feelings, Henry. Not with mine.

702
00:58:52,356 --> 00:58:56,022
It wasn't possible to lose you.

703
00:58:56,023 --> 00:58:58,314
I must hold you dearer
than I thought.

704
00:59:01,355 --> 00:59:06,314
You've got your enigmatic face
on. What's your mood, I wonder?

705
00:59:08,064 --> 00:59:10,314
Pure delight.

706
00:59:10,355 --> 00:59:14,313
I'm locked up with my sons.

707
00:59:15,104 --> 00:59:18,104
What mother does not
dream of that?

708
00:59:25,146 --> 00:59:27,354
One thing.
Yes?

709
00:59:28,353 --> 00:59:31,145
May I watch you kiss her?

710
00:59:31,353 --> 00:59:34,269
Can't you ever stop?

711
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:37,187
I watch you every night.

712
00:59:37,353 --> 00:59:40,312
I conjure it before I sleep.

713
00:59:41,187 --> 00:59:43,311
Leave it there.

714
00:59:43,352 --> 00:59:46,769
My curiosity is intellectual.

715
00:59:46,811 --> 00:59:50,186
I want to see
how accurate I am.

716
00:59:54,352 --> 00:59:58,226
Forget the dragon
in the doorway. Come.

717
01:00:01,351 --> 01:00:04,226
Believe I love you, for I do.

718
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:08,268
Believe I'm yours forever,
for I am.

719
01:00:09,351 --> 01:00:14,267
Believe in my contentment
and the joy you give me.

720
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:17,350
And believe...

721
01:00:22,309 --> 01:00:24,350
you want more?

722
01:00:30,349 --> 01:00:34,349
I'm an old man
in an empty place.

723
01:00:36,349 --> 01:00:38,349
Be with me.

724
01:01:30,304 --> 01:01:34,262
How beautiful you make me.

725
01:01:37,304 --> 01:01:43,261
What might solomon have sung
had he seen this.

726
01:01:45,303 --> 01:01:47,178
I can't.

727
01:01:47,219 --> 01:01:49,219
I'd turn to salt.

728
01:01:52,219 --> 01:01:54,218
I've lost again.

729
01:01:56,218 --> 01:01:59,218
I'm done for this time.

730
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:07,218
Well, there'll be
other Christmases.

731
01:02:09,217 --> 01:02:13,217
I'd hang you from the nipples,
but you'd shock the children.

732
01:02:20,717 --> 01:02:23,716
They kissed sweetly,
didn't they?

733
01:02:26,258 --> 01:02:30,258
I'll have him next time.
I can wait.

734
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:33,258
Ah, there you are!

735
01:02:34,258 --> 01:02:39,257
My comfort and my company.

736
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:44,257
We're locked in
for another year.

737
01:02:47,215 --> 01:02:49,174
Four seasons more.

738
01:02:52,215 --> 01:02:54,173
What a desolation.

739
01:02:57,214 --> 01:03:00,173
What a life's work.

740
01:03:07,006 --> 01:03:09,172
Is it too much?

741
01:03:09,213 --> 01:03:12,213
Be sure to squint
as you approach.

742
01:03:12,255 --> 01:03:15,213
You may be blinded
by my beauty.

743
01:03:15,255 --> 01:03:18,172
Merry Christmas.

744
01:03:18,213 --> 01:03:21,213
Is that why you're here...
to tell me that?

745
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:24,212
I thought you might be lonely.

746
01:03:24,254 --> 01:03:26,712
Here, chancellor.

747
01:03:26,754 --> 01:03:29,212
Try it on for size.

748
01:03:30,212 --> 01:03:32,171
It's puzzling.

749
01:03:32,212 --> 01:03:35,171
I remember my third birthday.

750
01:03:35,212 --> 01:03:38,211
Not just pictures
of the garden or the gifts,

751
01:03:38,253 --> 01:03:41,211
but who did what to whom
and how it felt.

752
01:03:42,211 --> 01:03:44,211
My memory stretches that far back,
but never once can I remember...

753
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:47,128
anything from you or father
warmer than indifference.

754
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:49,128
Why is that?

755
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:54,085
I don't know.

756
01:03:54,127 --> 01:03:58,169
That was not an easy question from me,
and I don't deserve and easy answer.

757
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:05,210
There are times I think we
loved none of our children.

758
01:04:05,252 --> 01:04:08,168
Still too easy,
don't you think?

759
01:04:08,209 --> 01:04:12,126
I'm weary, and you want
a simple answer,

760
01:04:12,168 --> 01:04:14,168
and I haven't one.

761
01:04:14,209 --> 01:04:18,126
I'm so sick of all of you.

762
01:04:18,251 --> 01:04:21,124
I thought I'd come
and gloat a little.

763
01:04:21,125 --> 01:04:24,125
Mother's tired. Come stick
pins tomorrow morning.

764
01:04:24,167 --> 01:04:26,124
I'll be more responsive then.

765
01:04:26,125 --> 01:04:29,250
It's no fun goading anyone
tonight. Bastard's boxed us up.

766
01:04:30,125 --> 01:04:33,292
What's that, dear? We're his
prisoners, if that interests you.

767
01:04:33,333 --> 01:04:36,124
Why should it?
I'm his prisoner anyway?

768
01:04:36,332 --> 01:04:38,291
It was... correct me
if I'm wrong...

769
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:41,291
but it was my impression that
you wanted Henry's throne for me.

770
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:45,332
We can't win, Richard.
We've lost it this time.

771
01:04:45,374 --> 01:04:48,041
You think I'm finished, do you? So I do.

772
01:04:48,082 --> 01:04:50,290
I've suffered more defeats
than you have teeth.

773
01:04:51,081 --> 01:04:53,040
I know one
when it happens to me.

774
01:04:53,081 --> 01:04:56,290
Take your wormwood like a good
boy. Swallow it and go to bed.

775
01:04:57,081 --> 01:04:59,330
I will be king. So you
will, but not this year!

776
01:04:59,331 --> 01:05:03,290
Oh, leave it, Richard!
Let it go for now.

777
01:05:04,081 --> 01:05:06,039
I can't.
It's not so hard.

778
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:09,330
Try saying after me:
John wins, I lose.

779
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:13,039
And what if John died?

780
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,372
You wouldn't dare! A
knife. Why wouldn't I?

781
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,080
He's got a knife! Of course he
has a knife. He always has a knife.

782
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:21,329
We all have knives. It's
1183, and we're barbarians.

783
01:05:21,371 --> 01:05:27,038
How clear we make it. Oh, my
piglets, we are the origins of war.

784
01:05:27,079 --> 01:05:30,413
Not history's forces, nor the times,
nor justice, nor the lack of it,

785
01:05:30,454 --> 01:05:33,371
nor causes, nor religions,
nor ideas,

786
01:05:33,413 --> 01:05:36,287
nor kinds of government,
nor any other thing.

787
01:05:36,537 --> 01:05:39,495
We are the killers.
We breed wars.

788
01:05:39,537 --> 01:05:42,412
We carry it,
like syphilis, inside.

789
01:05:42,453 --> 01:05:46,078
Dead bodies rot in field and stream
because the living ones are rotten.

790
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:49,036
For the love of God, can't we
love one another just a little?

791
01:05:49,411 --> 01:05:51,994
That's how peace begins.

792
01:05:53,036 --> 01:05:56,244
We have so much
to love each other for.

793
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:59,452
We have such possibilities,
my children.

794
01:06:00,036 --> 01:06:01,452
We could change the world.

795
01:06:02,036 --> 01:06:04,451
And while we hugged each other,
what would Philip do?

796
01:06:05,035 --> 01:06:07,493
Oh, good God, Philip!

797
01:06:08,035 --> 01:06:11,035
We're supposed to start a war. If
father finds out, I'll be ruined.

798
01:06:11,076 --> 01:06:14,326
Steady, John. Don't panic.
Some adviser you are.

799
01:06:14,618 --> 01:06:17,658
Don't do anything without me. Let me
handle it. He's made a pact with Philip.

800
01:06:18,034 --> 01:06:20,034
You advised John into making
war. That fearless boy...

801
01:06:20,075 --> 01:06:21,992
he's disinherited himself.

802
01:06:22,034 --> 01:06:24,992
When Henry finds out... when
I tell him what John's done...

803
01:06:25,034 --> 01:06:28,284
I need a little time. Can you keep
John from Philip till I say so?

804
01:06:28,325 --> 01:06:31,574
Anything you say. Richard, I want
you out of here before this breaks.

805
01:06:31,575 --> 01:06:33,573
And that means Philip.
Go to him, be desperate.

806
01:06:33,574 --> 01:06:35,573
Promise anything...
the vexin, brittany.

807
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:39,323
Once you're free and John is out
of favor, we'll make further plans.

808
01:06:39,324 --> 01:06:43,033
You see Philip. You're the diplomat.
You see him, you talk to him.

809
01:06:43,074 --> 01:06:45,616
You're a friend.
You know him, I don't.

810
01:06:48,948 --> 01:06:50,948
And Richard!

811
01:06:51,948 --> 01:06:54,948
Promise anything.

812
01:07:00,698 --> 01:07:02,906
I've got the old boy this time.

813
01:07:02,947 --> 01:07:05,947
The damn fool thinks he
loves John. He believes it.

814
01:07:05,989 --> 01:07:08,614
That's where the knife
goes in...

815
01:07:12,614 --> 01:07:14,614
knives.

816
01:07:15,947 --> 01:07:17,946
Knives.

817
01:07:20,655 --> 01:07:23,655
Where is that mirror? I'm Eleanor,
and I can look at anything.

818
01:07:25,946 --> 01:07:28,945
My, what a lovely girl.

819
01:07:28,946 --> 01:07:32,695
How could her king
have left her?

820
01:07:46,903 --> 01:07:48,903
Philip?

821
01:07:49,153 --> 01:07:51,903
Philip!

822
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:56,152
It's working out. By morning,
I can be the chosen son.

823
01:07:56,153 --> 01:08:01,152
The crown can come to me. Are you still
with me? We'll have to fight them all.

824
01:08:01,193 --> 01:08:03,633
They'll band together once this
happens. Have I got your word?

825
01:08:03,902 --> 01:08:06,902
Do I have yours? All England's
land in France if I support you?

826
01:08:06,943 --> 01:08:11,152
Are we allies then?
We were born to be.

827
01:08:11,193 --> 01:08:13,860
I should say something solemn,
but I haven't the time.

828
01:08:13,902 --> 01:08:16,901
I'm off to father with news that
John's a traitor. After that...

829
01:08:16,942 --> 01:08:21,151
you stink! You know that?
You're a stinker, and you stink.

830
01:08:22,526 --> 01:08:24,901
I'll kill you!
Ah!

831
01:08:24,942 --> 01:08:26,276
Lump.

832
01:08:26,901 --> 01:08:30,150
If you're a prince, there's
hope for every ape in africa.

833
01:08:30,441 --> 01:08:33,275
I had you saved. I wasn't on
my way to father, but he was.

834
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:36,900
He would have gone to Henry and
betrayed you. Look, it's in his face.

835
01:08:37,025 --> 01:08:40,900
It's true. I don't know
who my friends are.

836
01:08:43,037 --> 01:08:45,731
Philip?

837
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:50,815
- May we?
- That's what tapestries are for.

838
01:08:52,274 --> 01:08:54,815
I'll never learn.
I'll ruin everything.

839
01:09:00,856 --> 01:09:04,314
Richard?
Hello, Richard.

840
01:09:04,856 --> 01:09:08,355
You're halfway to bed. I'll
wait for morning. Come in.

841
01:09:08,356 --> 01:09:11,314
Mother sent me.
Come in anyway.

842
01:09:18,355 --> 01:09:20,855
Our alchemists have stumbled
on the art of boiling burgundy.

843
01:09:21,397 --> 01:09:25,855
It turns to steam, and when it
cools, we call it brandy-wine.

844
01:09:25,897 --> 01:09:29,396
I'm Henry's prisoner.
You find that charming?

845
01:09:29,854 --> 01:09:31,854
No. Then why the charming smile?

846
01:09:31,896 --> 01:09:33,854
I thought, I can't think why,

847
01:09:33,896 --> 01:09:35,854
of when you were in paris last.

848
01:09:36,437 --> 01:09:39,437
Can it be two whole years
ago? It can. I need an army.

849
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:41,437
It'll take the cold away.
I must have soldiers.

850
01:09:41,479 --> 01:09:44,811
Have I aged?
Do I seem older to you?

851
01:09:44,853 --> 01:09:48,853
They've been two fierce years. I've
studied, and I've trained to be a king.

852
01:09:49,478 --> 01:09:53,478
I'll have your answer... yes or
no? You'll have it when I give it.

853
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,478
You see?
I've changed.

854
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,852
I'm not the boy you taught to
hunt two years ago. Remember?

855
01:09:58,894 --> 01:10:01,519
Racing after boar,
you flying first,

856
01:10:01,852 --> 01:10:05,852
me scrambling after,
all day into dusk.

857
01:10:05,894 --> 01:10:09,852
Don't go. I must know. Will you help me?

858
01:10:09,894 --> 01:10:12,851
Sit and we'll discuss it.

859
01:10:22,851 --> 01:10:25,600
You never write.
To anyone.

860
01:10:25,601 --> 01:10:27,850
Why should I make you
king of England?

861
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,808
Aren't I better off
with John or Geoffrey?

862
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:33,850
Why have you to fight when I
could have the cretin or the fiend?

863
01:10:33,892 --> 01:10:37,642
Would we fight? We're
fighting now. Good night.

864
01:10:39,558 --> 01:10:41,807
You're still a boy.

865
01:10:41,849 --> 01:10:45,682
In some ways.
Which way did you have in mind?

866
01:10:45,849 --> 01:10:49,766
You haven't asked how much your
help is worth. You'll tell me.

867
01:10:49,807 --> 01:10:51,766
You can have the vexin back.
And what else?

868
01:10:51,807 --> 01:10:54,516
All of brittany. Does that
matter? That's Geoffrey's.

869
01:10:54,807 --> 01:10:57,640
Possibly to Geoffrey. And what
else? That's all your help is worth.

870
01:10:57,681 --> 01:10:59,640
And in return,
what do you want from me?

871
01:10:59,806 --> 01:11:01,640
Two thousand soldiers.

872
01:11:01,806 --> 01:11:03,726
- And what else?
- Five hundred knights on horse.

873
01:11:03,806 --> 01:11:05,765
- And what else?
- Arms and siege equipment.

874
01:11:05,806 --> 01:11:10,680
- And what else?
- I never wrote because I thought you'd never answer.

875
01:11:14,722 --> 01:11:16,764
You got married.

876
01:11:16,805 --> 01:11:20,764
Does that make a difference? Doesn't it?

877
01:11:23,722 --> 01:11:27,763
I've spent two years
on every street in hell.

878
01:11:31,763 --> 01:11:33,763
That's odd.
I never saw you there.

879
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:02,719
You haven't said you loved me.

880
01:12:09,718 --> 01:12:11,718
When the time comes.

881
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:28,717
Shh.

882
01:12:43,716 --> 01:12:45,716
It's not too late at night?

883
01:12:47,674 --> 01:12:50,633
I'd hoped you'd come.
Good!

884
01:12:50,674 --> 01:12:53,673
We couldn't leave negotiations
where they were.

885
01:12:56,673 --> 01:12:59,632
Ah!

886
01:12:59,673 --> 01:13:03,673
I keep looking for your
father in you. He's not there.

887
01:13:03,715 --> 01:13:05,673
I'll miss him.

888
01:13:06,673 --> 01:13:09,672
Has Richard or the queen
been here to see you?

889
01:13:09,714 --> 01:13:12,631
Does it matter? If they
haven't yet, they will.

890
01:13:12,672 --> 01:13:16,672
I want to reach a settlement. I
left you with too little earlier.

891
01:13:16,714 --> 01:13:19,631
Yes.
Nothing is too little.

892
01:13:19,672 --> 01:13:21,631
I'm sorry
you're not fonder of me, lad.

893
01:13:21,672 --> 01:13:25,671
Your father always said,
"be fond of stronger men."

894
01:13:25,713 --> 01:13:27,671
No wonder he loved everyone.

895
01:13:28,671 --> 01:13:32,671
I've come to you
to offer peace.

896
01:13:32,713 --> 01:13:35,671
Piss on your peace.

897
01:13:36,670 --> 01:13:39,670
Your father would have wept.

898
01:13:39,712 --> 01:13:41,670
My father was a weeper.

899
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:45,670
Fight me, and you'll lose.

900
01:13:46,587 --> 01:13:48,587
I can't lose, Henry.

901
01:13:49,587 --> 01:13:52,585
I have time.
Why, just look at you.

902
01:13:52,586 --> 01:13:56,586
Great heavy arms. But each
year they get a little heavier.

903
01:13:56,628 --> 01:14:00,628
The sand goes pit-pat
in the glass.

904
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:04,586
I'm in no hurry, Henry.
I've got time.

905
01:14:04,628 --> 01:14:08,626
Suppose I hurry things along. Suppose I
say that England is at war with France.

906
01:14:08,627 --> 01:14:13,585
Then France surrenders. I
don't have to fight to win.

907
01:14:13,627 --> 01:14:17,585
Take all you want... this county,
that one. You won't keep it long.

908
01:14:18,627 --> 01:14:21,584
What kind of courage
have you got?

909
01:14:22,626 --> 01:14:24,584
The tidal kind...

910
01:14:27,626 --> 01:14:29,584
it comes and goes.

911
01:14:30,626 --> 01:14:33,584
By God, I'd love to turn you
loose on Eleanor. More brandy-wine?

912
01:14:33,626 --> 01:14:38,624
You recognize it? They were boiling
it in ireland before the snakes left.

913
01:14:38,625 --> 01:14:43,583
Well, things look a little bleak
for Henry, don't they?

914
01:14:43,625 --> 01:14:48,541
You'll say yes to Richard when he
comes... arms, soldiers, anything he asks.

915
01:14:48,583 --> 01:14:50,540
I'd be foolish not to.
Yeah.

916
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:55,540
And withdraw it all before the battle
ever started. Wouldn't you, in my place?

917
01:14:56,540 --> 01:14:58,540
Why fight Henry when his sons
will do it for you?

918
01:14:58,582 --> 01:15:01,499
Yes, exactly.

919
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:05,539
- You've got promise, lad. That's
first-class thinking. - Thank you, sir.

920
01:15:19,538 --> 01:15:23,497
Good night. Good night? You're
going? We haven't settled anything.

921
01:15:23,538 --> 01:15:26,578
We open Christmas presents at noon.
Till then. You can't be finished with me.

922
01:15:27,538 --> 01:15:30,538
Oh, but I am. It's been most
satisfactory. What's so satisfactory?

923
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:35,578
Winning is. I did just
win. Surely you noticed.

924
01:15:35,579 --> 01:15:40,537
Not a thing. You
haven't won a damn thing.

925
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:44,536
Hmm.

926
01:15:44,537 --> 01:15:48,495
I found out the way your mind
works and the kind of man you are.

927
01:15:48,536 --> 01:15:50,453
I know your plans
and expectations.

928
01:15:50,495 --> 01:15:52,453
You've burbled every bit
of strategy you've got.

929
01:15:52,495 --> 01:15:55,495
I know exactly what you will do
and exactly what you won't.

930
01:15:55,536 --> 01:15:57,453
And I've told you
exactly nothing!

931
01:15:57,495 --> 01:16:01,495
To these aged eyes, boy, that's
what winning looks like! Dormez bien.

932
01:16:01,536 --> 01:16:03,494
You...

933
01:16:05,994 --> 01:16:09,494
you made my father nothing.

934
01:16:11,494 --> 01:16:13,494
You were always better.

935
01:16:14,494 --> 01:16:16,494
You bullied him,

936
01:16:17,494 --> 01:16:19,451
you bellied with his wife,

937
01:16:19,493 --> 01:16:22,493
you beat him down in every war,

938
01:16:22,534 --> 01:16:24,993
you twisted every treaty,

939
01:16:25,034 --> 01:16:27,493
you played mock the monk,

940
01:16:28,493 --> 01:16:31,493
and then you made him
love you for it.

941
01:16:31,534 --> 01:16:34,450
I was there.

942
01:16:34,492 --> 01:16:37,450
His last words went to you.

943
01:16:37,492 --> 01:16:40,492
He was a loving man, and you've
learned nothing of it.

944
01:16:40,533 --> 01:16:45,450
I learned how much fathers
live in sons.

945
01:16:45,492 --> 01:16:49,407
A king like you has policy
prepared on everything.

946
01:16:50,407 --> 01:16:53,407
What's the official line
on sodomy?

947
01:16:53,699 --> 01:16:58,407
How stands the crown
on boys who do with boys?

948
01:17:03,406 --> 01:17:06,406
Richard finds his way
into so many legends.

949
01:17:06,448 --> 01:17:09,406
Let's hear yours
and see how it compares.

950
01:17:09,448 --> 01:17:11,448
He found me first
when I was 15.

951
01:17:11,490 --> 01:17:13,447
We were hunting.
It was nearly dark.

952
01:17:13,448 --> 01:17:16,447
My horse fell, I was thrown.

953
01:17:16,489 --> 01:17:19,405
I woke to Richard touching me.

954
01:17:21,447 --> 01:17:24,405
He asked me if I loved him.

955
01:17:24,447 --> 01:17:27,405
"Philip, do you love me?"

956
01:17:29,447 --> 01:17:31,404
And I told him, "yes."

957
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:35,404
Do you know why I told him yes?

958
01:17:36,446 --> 01:17:40,445
So that one day I could
tell you all about it.

959
01:17:40,446 --> 01:17:44,904
You cannot imagine
what that "yes" cost.

960
01:17:44,946 --> 01:17:49,320
Imagine snuggling
to a chancred whore...

961
01:17:49,362 --> 01:17:53,362
and bending back your lips into
something like a smile, saying,

962
01:17:53,403 --> 01:17:55,362
"yes,

963
01:17:56,403 --> 01:18:00,361
"I love you,

964
01:18:00,402 --> 01:18:03,444
"and I find you...

965
01:18:03,486 --> 01:18:05,402
beautiful."

966
01:18:08,444 --> 01:18:10,402
I don't know how I did it.

967
01:18:11,277 --> 01:18:15,443
- No! It wasn't like that!
- But it was.

968
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,443
You loved me.

969
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:29,359
Never.

970
01:18:38,525 --> 01:18:41,567
Get out. Please.

971
01:18:42,359 --> 01:18:43,567
I don't want you here.

972
01:18:44,358 --> 01:18:46,483
It's no great pleasure
to be here.

973
01:18:46,524 --> 01:18:49,483
So the royal corkscrew
finds me twisted, does he?

974
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:53,316
I'll go tell your mother. She'll
be pleased. She knows. She sent me.

975
01:18:53,358 --> 01:18:56,274
How completely hers you are.

976
01:18:56,316 --> 01:18:59,523
You've had four sons.
Who do you claim?

977
01:18:59,565 --> 01:19:01,523
Not Henry.
Not my buried brother.

978
01:19:01,565 --> 01:19:05,565
Not that monument to muck,
that epic idiot.

979
01:19:05,607 --> 01:19:08,440
Why him? Why always him and never me?

980
01:19:08,482 --> 01:19:11,315
He was the eldest.
He came first.

981
01:19:13,314 --> 01:19:16,314
Christ, Henry, is that all?

982
01:19:16,356 --> 01:19:18,606
You went with Eleanor.

983
01:19:18,897 --> 01:19:22,647
You never called me.
You never said my name.

984
01:19:24,314 --> 01:19:28,313
I'd have walked. I'd have
crawled. I'd have done anything.

985
01:19:29,646 --> 01:19:33,646
It's not my fault.
I won't be blamed.

986
01:19:35,313 --> 01:19:37,313
I only wanted you.

987
01:19:37,688 --> 01:19:41,729
No, my crown. You want my
kingdom. You keep your kingdom.

988
01:19:41,730 --> 01:19:43,687
That I will.
I hope it kills you.

989
01:19:45,729 --> 01:19:49,687
Thank God I have another son.
Thank God for John.

990
01:19:50,312 --> 01:19:53,729
And who shall we thank for
Geoffrey? You don't think much of me.

991
01:19:57,311 --> 01:20:00,311
"Much"? I don't think
of you at all.

992
01:20:00,353 --> 01:20:03,269
Nurse used to say
I had your hands.

993
01:20:03,311 --> 01:20:06,769
I might have had more of you.
Try seeing me.

994
01:20:07,061 --> 01:20:10,269
I haven't Richard's military skill,
but he was here betraying you, not I.

995
01:20:10,311 --> 01:20:16,310
I haven't John's... God knows what you
see in John... and he's betrayed you too.

996
01:20:16,352 --> 01:20:18,310
You think I'd ever
make you king?

997
01:20:18,810 --> 01:20:21,310
You'll make me king
because I'm all you've got.

998
01:20:21,435 --> 01:20:25,310
I was to be his chancellor.
Ask him why. I've heard enough.

999
01:20:25,852 --> 01:20:27,309
For moving John to treason.

1000
01:20:28,851 --> 01:20:31,892
I don't doubt he offered,
I don't doubt you tried,

1001
01:20:31,934 --> 01:20:34,851
and I don't doubt
John loves me.

1002
01:20:35,309 --> 01:20:37,309
Like a glutton loves his lunch.

1003
01:20:41,308 --> 01:20:43,308
You turd.

1004
01:20:51,891 --> 01:20:53,891
Well, John?

1005
01:20:55,266 --> 01:20:58,849
It isn't what you think.
What do I think?

1006
01:20:58,890 --> 01:21:02,932
What Geoffrey said. I wouldn't
plot against you, ever.

1007
01:21:02,974 --> 01:21:05,890
I know.
You're a good boy.

1008
01:21:05,932 --> 01:21:09,807
Can I go now, please? It's
late. I ought to be in bed.

1009
01:21:17,973 --> 01:21:21,973
Couldn't you wait? Couldn't
you trust me? It was all yours.

1010
01:21:22,264 --> 01:21:24,264
Couldn't you believe that?
Will you listen to the grief?

1011
01:21:24,306 --> 01:21:27,263
Who do you think I built
this kingdom for? Me!

1012
01:21:27,972 --> 01:21:29,971
Daddy did it all for me.

1013
01:21:29,972 --> 01:21:33,263
When can I have it, daddy?
Not until we bury you?

1014
01:21:33,347 --> 01:21:38,013
- I loved you.
- You're a cold and bloody bastard, you are.

1015
01:21:38,055 --> 01:21:41,012
And you don't love anything.

1016
01:21:44,054 --> 01:21:48,053
I'm it.
I'm all that's left.

1017
01:21:48,054 --> 01:21:52,012
Here, father.
Here I am.

1018
01:22:14,094 --> 01:22:18,177
My life, when it is written,
will read better than it lived.

1019
01:22:19,177 --> 01:22:23,135
Henry fitz-empress, first
plantagenet, a king at 21,

1020
01:22:23,177 --> 01:22:25,176
the ablest soldier
of an able time.

1021
01:22:27,134 --> 01:22:29,175
He led men well, he cared
for justice when he could...

1022
01:22:29,176 --> 01:22:33,134
and ruled, for 30 years, a state
as great as Charlemagne's.

1023
01:22:34,176 --> 01:22:39,133
He married out of love
a woman out of legend.

1024
01:22:39,175 --> 01:22:43,175
Not in alexandria or rome or
camelot has there been such a queen.

1025
01:22:45,217 --> 01:22:49,133
She bore him many children,

1026
01:22:49,175 --> 01:22:51,092
but no sons.

1027
01:22:51,133 --> 01:22:54,132
King Henry had no sons.

1028
01:22:56,132 --> 01:23:01,132
He had three whiskered things,
but he disowned them.

1029
01:23:01,174 --> 01:23:06,132
You're not mine!
We're not connected!

1030
01:23:06,174 --> 01:23:09,090
I deny you!

1031
01:23:09,131 --> 01:23:11,090
None of you will get my kingdom.
I leave you nothing!

1032
01:23:11,131 --> 01:23:16,131
And I wish you plague! May all
your children breech and die!

1033
01:23:23,130 --> 01:23:25,130
My boys are gone.

1034
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:32,130
I've lost my boys.

1035
01:23:52,087 --> 01:23:54,586
You dare to damn me, do you?

1036
01:23:54,587 --> 01:23:57,086
Well, I'll damn you back.

1037
01:23:57,087 --> 01:24:00,045
Goddamn you!

1038
01:24:06,086 --> 01:24:08,044
My boys are gone.

1039
01:24:10,086 --> 01:24:12,044
I've lost my boys.

1040
01:24:15,086 --> 01:24:19,044
Oh, jesus.

1041
01:24:21,085 --> 01:24:23,043
All my boys.

1042
01:25:35,996 --> 01:25:37,996
Henry?

1043
01:27:32,072 --> 01:27:37,905
<i>The Christmas wine
is in the pot</i>

1044
01:27:39,905 --> 01:27:44,072
<i>The Christmas coals are red</i>

1045
01:27:45,072 --> 01:27:49,571
<i>I'll spend my day
the lover's way</i>

1046
01:27:49,612 --> 01:27:54,071
<i>Unwrapping all my gifts</i>

1047
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:57,071
<i>In bed</i>

1048
01:27:59,112 --> 01:28:02,111
<i>The Christmas mass</i>

1049
01:28:02,153 --> 01:28:05,110
<i>Is over now</i>

1050
01:28:05,111 --> 01:28:10,820
<i>The Christmas prayers are done</i>

1051
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:17,818
No one else is caroling.
It might as well be lent.

1052
01:28:17,819 --> 01:28:22,152
When I was little, Christmas was
a time of great confusion to me.

1053
01:28:22,194 --> 01:28:25,819
The holy land had two kings...
God and uncle raymond.

1054
01:28:26,194 --> 01:28:29,152
I never knew whose birthday
we were celebrating.

1055
01:28:29,194 --> 01:28:32,193
Henry isn't here. Good, we
can talk behind his back.

1056
01:28:32,818 --> 01:28:34,818
What happened?
Don't you know?

1057
01:28:35,234 --> 01:28:38,818
There was a scene with beds and
tapestries, and many things got said.

1058
01:28:39,234 --> 01:28:41,193
Spiced wine.

1059
01:28:41,234 --> 01:28:45,150
I'd forgotten Henry liked it.
May I stay?

1060
01:28:45,192 --> 01:28:48,775
It's your room just as much as
mine. We're both in residence.

1061
01:28:48,817 --> 01:28:51,192
Packed in like the poor,
three to a bed.

1062
01:28:52,775 --> 01:28:54,733
Did you love Henry...
ever?

1063
01:28:54,775 --> 01:28:59,191
Ever? Back before the flood?
As long ago as rosamund.

1064
01:28:59,232 --> 01:29:03,774
Ah, that's prehistory, lamb. There
are no written records or survivors.

1065
01:29:03,816 --> 01:29:07,232
There are pictures. She was
prettier than you. Oh, much.

1066
01:29:07,274 --> 01:29:11,274
Her eyes, in certain light, were
violet, and all her teeth were even.

1067
01:29:11,316 --> 01:29:13,232
That's a rare, fair feature...
even teeth.

1068
01:29:13,274 --> 01:29:17,773
She smiled to excess, but she
chewed with real distinction.

1069
01:29:17,815 --> 01:29:19,773
And you hate her even now.

1070
01:29:19,815 --> 01:29:22,273
No, but I did.

1071
01:29:22,315 --> 01:29:27,523
He put her in my place, you see,
and that was very hard.

1072
01:29:27,565 --> 01:29:32,772
Like you, she headed Henry's
table. That's my chair.

1073
01:29:34,355 --> 01:29:36,855
And so you had her poisoned.

1074
01:29:36,897 --> 01:29:39,354
No, I never poisoned rosamund.

1075
01:29:39,355 --> 01:29:41,355
Oh, I prayed for her to drop...

1076
01:29:41,772 --> 01:29:45,396
and smiled a little
when she did.

1077
01:29:45,438 --> 01:29:47,729
Why aren't you happy?

1078
01:29:47,771 --> 01:29:52,396
Henry's keeping you. You
must be cleverer than I am.

1079
01:29:52,438 --> 01:29:54,395
I've tried feeling pity
for you,

1080
01:29:54,396 --> 01:29:56,771
but it keeps on turning
into something else.

1081
01:29:57,437 --> 01:29:59,395
Why pity?

1082
01:29:59,437 --> 01:30:03,770
You love Henry, but you
love his kingdom too.

1083
01:30:03,812 --> 01:30:06,478
You look at him,
and you see cities,

1084
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:10,478
acreage, coastline, taxes.

1085
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:12,769
All I see is Henry.

1086
01:30:14,477 --> 01:30:16,769
Leave him to me, can't you?

1087
01:30:18,519 --> 01:30:20,769
I left him years ago.

1088
01:30:22,519 --> 01:30:24,769
And I thought I could move you.

1089
01:30:24,811 --> 01:30:27,518
Were you always like this?

1090
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:30,518
When I was young and worshipped
you, is this what you were like?

1091
01:30:30,768 --> 01:30:33,518
Most likely.

1092
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:38,560
Child, I'm finished, and I've come
to give him anything he asks for.

1093
01:30:40,601 --> 01:30:44,599
Do you know what I
should like for Christmas?

1094
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:46,725
I should like
to see you suffer.

1095
01:30:49,725 --> 01:30:53,559
Alais, just for you.

1096
01:30:57,724 --> 01:31:01,724
Alors, ma petite.

1097
01:31:03,599 --> 01:31:06,599
J'ai peur, maman.
No, no.

1098
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:22,640
The sky is pocked with stars.

1099
01:31:27,722 --> 01:31:32,681
What eyes the wise men must have
had to see a new one in so many.

1100
01:31:32,722 --> 01:31:35,722
You look cold. I've mulled some wine.

1101
01:31:35,764 --> 01:31:38,681
I wonder...
were there fewer stars then?

1102
01:31:38,722 --> 01:31:42,721
I don't know. I fancy
there's a mystery in it.

1103
01:31:42,763 --> 01:31:45,638
What's this?
Warm wine.

1104
01:31:46,638 --> 01:31:48,638
Why, so it is.

1105
01:31:51,638 --> 01:31:54,637
You are as beautiful
as I remembered.

1106
01:31:56,637 --> 01:31:58,077
Off you go.
My widow wants to see me.

1107
01:31:58,637 --> 01:32:00,637
She came to find out what
your plans are. I know.

1108
01:32:01,554 --> 01:32:04,637
She wants you back.
Go to your room.

1109
01:32:10,678 --> 01:32:13,636
So, you want me back.

1110
01:32:15,678 --> 01:32:17,636
She thinks I do.

1111
01:32:17,678 --> 01:32:20,677
She thinks the need
for loving never stops.

1112
01:32:20,678 --> 01:32:22,636
She has a point.

1113
01:32:23,677 --> 01:32:25,635
I marvel at you.
After all these years,

1114
01:32:25,677 --> 01:32:28,676
still like a democratic drawbridge,
going down for everybody.

1115
01:32:28,677 --> 01:32:32,635
At my age, there's not
much traffic anymore.

1116
01:32:34,677 --> 01:32:36,635
To your interminable health.

1117
01:32:39,842 --> 01:32:44,676
- Well, wife, what's on your mind?
- I've just seen Richard.

1118
01:32:44,717 --> 01:32:47,842
Splendid boy.
He says you fought.

1119
01:32:48,592 --> 01:32:50,551
We always do.

1120
01:32:50,592 --> 01:32:53,841
It's his impression that
you mean to disinherit them.

1121
01:32:53,883 --> 01:32:55,800
I fancy I'll relent.

1122
01:32:56,383 --> 01:32:58,841
Don't you?
I don't much care.

1123
01:32:58,883 --> 01:33:01,591
In fact, I wonder, Henry,
if I care for anything.

1124
01:33:01,633 --> 01:33:03,591
I wonder if I'm hungry
out of habit.

1125
01:33:03,883 --> 01:33:07,383
I could listen to you lie
for hours.

1126
01:33:07,425 --> 01:33:10,882
So your lust is rusty.
Gorgeous.

1127
01:33:12,882 --> 01:33:14,882
Henry, I'm so tired.

1128
01:33:15,382 --> 01:33:18,590
Sleep then. Sleep and
dream of me with croutons.

1129
01:33:18,632 --> 01:33:20,549
Henri a la mode.

1130
01:33:20,590 --> 01:33:23,881
- Henry, stop it.
- Eleanor, I haven't started.

1131
01:33:23,923 --> 01:33:26,964
What do you want? You want my
name on paper? I'll sign anything.

1132
01:33:27,006 --> 01:33:28,923
You want the Aquitaine
for John? It's John's.

1133
01:33:28,964 --> 01:33:32,964
It's his, it's yours, it's
anybody's. In exchange for what?

1134
01:33:33,006 --> 01:33:35,006
For nothing.
For a little quiet.

1135
01:33:35,048 --> 01:33:37,005
For an end to this,
for God's sake.

1136
01:33:37,047 --> 01:33:39,005
Sail me back to England,
lock me up...

1137
01:33:39,588 --> 01:33:42,005
and lose the key
and let me be alone.

1138
01:33:47,547 --> 01:33:49,505
You have my oath.

1139
01:33:51,962 --> 01:33:55,546
I give my word.
Oh, well.

1140
01:33:57,254 --> 01:33:59,546
Well, well.

1141
01:34:02,004 --> 01:34:06,545
Would you like a pillow?
Footstool? How about a shawl?

1142
01:34:06,753 --> 01:34:11,545
Your oaths are all profanities, your words a
curse, your name on paper is a waste of pulp!

1143
01:34:11,586 --> 01:34:15,045
I'm vilifying you, for
God's sake! Pay attention!

1144
01:34:17,086 --> 01:34:19,045
How,

1145
01:34:19,545 --> 01:34:21,544
from where we started,

1146
01:34:23,085 --> 01:34:26,544
did we ever reach
this Christmas?

1147
01:34:29,544 --> 01:34:31,544
Step by step.

1148
01:34:34,544 --> 01:34:36,501
What happens to me now?

1149
01:34:36,543 --> 01:34:40,543
That's lively curiosity
from such a dead cat.

1150
01:34:40,584 --> 01:34:44,501
If you want to know
my plans, just ask me.

1151
01:34:44,543 --> 01:34:47,084
Conquer china, sack the
vatican, or take the veil.

1152
01:34:47,459 --> 01:34:50,457
I'm not among the ones
who give a damn.

1153
01:34:50,458 --> 01:34:55,124
Just let me sign my lands
to John and go to bed.

1154
01:34:55,125 --> 01:34:57,457
No, you're too kind.
I can't accept.

1155
01:34:57,458 --> 01:35:01,458
Come on, man, I'll sign the thing
in blood or spit or bright blue ink.

1156
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:04,124
Let's have it done.
Let's not.

1157
01:35:04,125 --> 01:35:08,166
No, I don't think I want
your signature on anything.

1158
01:35:10,457 --> 01:35:13,166
You don't?
Dear God,

1159
01:35:13,457 --> 01:35:17,166
the pleasure I still get
from goading you.

1160
01:35:17,207 --> 01:35:21,331
You don't want John to have
my provinces? Bull's-eye.

1161
01:35:21,373 --> 01:35:25,456
I can't bear you when
you're smug. I know, I know.

1162
01:35:25,498 --> 01:35:30,248
You don't want Richard, and you
don't want John. You've grasped it.

1163
01:35:30,290 --> 01:35:33,456
All right, then, shatter me!

1164
01:35:33,498 --> 01:35:38,289
Let me have it.
What do you want?

1165
01:35:40,497 --> 01:35:42,455
A new wife.

1166
01:35:50,413 --> 01:35:52,413
Oh.

1167
01:35:55,413 --> 01:35:58,371
So,

1168
01:35:58,413 --> 01:36:01,413
I'm to be annulled.

1169
01:36:05,287 --> 01:36:09,287
Well, will the pope annul me,

1170
01:36:09,412 --> 01:36:11,287
do you think?

1171
01:36:11,328 --> 01:36:15,203
The pontiff owes me one
pontificate. I think he will.

1172
01:36:16,412 --> 01:36:18,869
Out Eleanor,

1173
01:36:18,911 --> 01:36:21,327
in alais.

1174
01:36:24,369 --> 01:36:29,411
- Why?
- A new wife, wife, will bear me sons.

1175
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:34,410
That is the single thing...

1176
01:36:35,368 --> 01:36:39,410
of which I would have thought
you had enough.

1177
01:36:39,451 --> 01:36:42,368
I want a son.
We could populate...

1178
01:36:42,410 --> 01:36:47,367
a country town with country
girls who've borne you sons.

1179
01:36:47,409 --> 01:36:50,367
How many is it?
Help me count the bastards.

1180
01:36:50,409 --> 01:36:52,325
All my sons are bastards.

1181
01:37:00,367 --> 01:37:04,366
You really mean to do it.
Lady love, with all my heart.

1182
01:37:05,366 --> 01:37:07,324
Your sons are part of you.

1183
01:37:07,366 --> 01:37:10,366
Like warts and goiters,
and I'm having them removed.

1184
01:37:10,408 --> 01:37:13,366
We've made them.
They're our boys.

1185
01:37:13,408 --> 01:37:15,866
I know, and good God,
look at them.

1186
01:37:15,908 --> 01:37:18,323
Geoffrey...
there's a masterpiece.

1187
01:37:18,365 --> 01:37:22,365
He isn't flesh, he's a device.
He's wheels and gears.

1188
01:37:22,907 --> 01:37:26,323
And johnny...

1189
01:37:26,365 --> 01:37:29,365
was his latest treason
your idea?

1190
01:37:31,364 --> 01:37:35,322
I caught him lying,
and I've said, "he's young."

1191
01:37:35,364 --> 01:37:38,322
I found him cheating, and
I've said, "he's just a boy."

1192
01:37:38,364 --> 01:37:43,364
I've watched him steal and whore and
whip his servants, and he's not a child.

1193
01:37:43,406 --> 01:37:46,362
He's the man we made him.

1194
01:37:46,363 --> 01:37:49,279
Don't share John with me.

1195
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:53,280
He's your accomplishment.
And Richard's yours.

1196
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:58,280
How could you send him off
to deal with Philip?

1197
01:38:00,279 --> 01:38:02,279
I was tired.

1198
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:04,279
I was busy.

1199
01:38:05,279 --> 01:38:07,278
They were friends.

1200
01:38:07,279 --> 01:38:10,279
Eleanor, he was the best.

1201
01:38:12,279 --> 01:38:16,278
From the cradle on, you cradled
him. I never had a chance.

1202
01:38:16,319 --> 01:38:19,278
You never wanted one. How
do you know? You took him.

1203
01:38:20,278 --> 01:38:23,318
Separation from your husband
you could bear, but not your son.

1204
01:38:23,319 --> 01:38:26,319
Whatever I have done,
you made me do.

1205
01:38:26,361 --> 01:38:28,819
You threw me out of bed
for Richard.

1206
01:38:28,861 --> 01:38:31,277
Not until you threw me out
for rosamund.

1207
01:38:31,318 --> 01:38:37,317
It's not that simple. I won't
have it to be that simple.

1208
01:38:37,318 --> 01:38:41,317
I adored you.
Never.

1209
01:38:41,318 --> 01:38:44,276
I still do.

1210
01:38:44,317 --> 01:38:47,234
Of all the lies,
that one is the most terrible.

1211
01:38:47,276 --> 01:38:52,234
I know. That's why
I saved it up for now.

1212
01:39:04,233 --> 01:39:09,233
Oh, Henry, we've mangled
everything we've touched.

1213
01:39:10,233 --> 01:39:14,232
Deny us what you will,
we have done that.

1214
01:39:17,232 --> 01:39:21,190
Do you remember when we met?

1215
01:39:21,232 --> 01:39:25,232
Down to the hour
and color of your stockings.

1216
01:39:30,231 --> 01:39:34,231
I could hardly see you
for the sunlight.

1217
01:39:34,273 --> 01:39:37,231
It was raining, but no matter.

1218
01:39:41,231 --> 01:39:45,230
There was very little talk,
as I recall.

1219
01:39:45,272 --> 01:39:47,188
Very little.

1220
01:39:47,230 --> 01:39:50,730
I had never seen such beauty.

1221
01:39:50,772 --> 01:39:54,230
I walked right up
and touched it.

1222
01:39:56,230 --> 01:39:59,229
God, where did I find
the gall to do that?

1223
01:39:59,271 --> 01:40:02,229
In my eyes.

1224
01:40:03,229 --> 01:40:05,229
I loved you.

1225
01:40:18,228 --> 01:40:21,227
No annulment.

1226
01:40:21,228 --> 01:40:25,228
What? There will be no annulment.

1227
01:40:25,311 --> 01:40:29,227
Will there not? No, I'm afraid
you'll have to do without.

1228
01:40:29,269 --> 01:40:32,310
Well, it was just a whim.

1229
01:40:32,352 --> 01:40:36,352
I'm so relieved.
I didn't want to lose you.

1230
01:40:38,394 --> 01:40:43,351
Out of curiosity, as
intellectual to intellectual,

1231
01:40:44,268 --> 01:40:47,184
how in the name of bleeding
jesus can you lose me?

1232
01:40:49,184 --> 01:40:50,985
Do we ever see each other?
Am I ever near you?

1233
01:40:51,184 --> 01:40:53,351
Ever with you? Am I ever
anywhere but somewhere else?

1234
01:40:54,184 --> 01:40:56,142
Do I write?
Do we send messages?

1235
01:40:56,183 --> 01:41:00,183
Do dinghies bearing gifts float up
the thames to you? Are you remembered?

1236
01:41:00,225 --> 01:41:02,142
You are.

1237
01:41:02,183 --> 01:41:06,183
You're no part of me. We
do not touch at any point.

1238
01:41:06,225 --> 01:41:09,683
How can you lose me?
Can't you feel the chains?

1239
01:41:09,725 --> 01:41:13,182
You know me well enough
to know I can't be stopped.

1240
01:41:13,432 --> 01:41:17,141
I don't have to stop you.
I have only to delay you.

1241
01:41:17,182 --> 01:41:22,432
Every enemy you have has friends
in rome. We'll cost you time.

1242
01:41:22,474 --> 01:41:26,140
What is this?
I'm not moldering.

1243
01:41:26,181 --> 01:41:30,473
My paint's not peeling. I'm
good for years. How many years?

1244
01:41:30,765 --> 01:41:35,473
Suppose I hold you back for one.
I can. It's possible.

1245
01:41:35,515 --> 01:41:40,180
Suppose your first son dies.
Ours did. It's possible.

1246
01:41:40,222 --> 01:41:43,514
Suppose you're daughtered next.
We were.

1247
01:41:43,555 --> 01:41:46,847
That, too, is possible.

1248
01:41:46,889 --> 01:41:50,013
How old is daddy then?

1249
01:41:50,014 --> 01:41:53,097
What kind of spindly,

1250
01:41:53,139 --> 01:41:57,096
rickett-ridden, milky,
wizened, dim-eyed,

1251
01:41:57,138 --> 01:42:03,137
gammy-handed, limpy line
of things will you beget?

1252
01:42:03,138 --> 01:42:05,096
It's sweet of you to care.

1253
01:42:05,138 --> 01:42:10,137
And when you die, which is
regrettable but necessary,

1254
01:42:10,178 --> 01:42:15,095
what will happen to frail Alais
and her pruney prince?

1255
01:42:15,137 --> 01:42:20,095
You can't think Richard's going
to wait for your grotesque to grow.

1256
01:42:21,137 --> 01:42:24,094
You wouldn't let him
do a thing like that?

1257
01:42:24,136 --> 01:42:28,094
Let him? I'd push him
through the nursery door.

1258
01:42:29,136 --> 01:42:32,094
You're not that cruel.

1259
01:42:32,136 --> 01:42:36,136
Don't fret. We'll wait
until you're dead to do it.

1260
01:42:36,177 --> 01:42:40,093
Eleanor, what do you want?

1261
01:42:40,135 --> 01:42:42,093
Just what you want...
a king for a son.

1262
01:42:42,135 --> 01:42:46,010
You can make more, I can't.
You think I want to disappear?

1263
01:42:46,051 --> 01:42:51,051
One son is all I've got, and you
can blot him out and call me cruel?

1264
01:42:51,885 --> 01:42:55,050
For these ten years, you've
lived with everything I've lost...

1265
01:42:55,092 --> 01:42:59,050
and loved another woman
through it all, and I am cruel?

1266
01:42:59,092 --> 01:43:01,050
I could peel you like a pear,

1267
01:43:01,092 --> 01:43:05,134
and God himself
would call it justice.

1268
01:43:08,049 --> 01:43:10,133
I will die sometime soon.

1269
01:43:11,133 --> 01:43:14,008
One day I'll duck too slow,
and at westminster,

1270
01:43:14,049 --> 01:43:16,210
they'll sing out "long live
the king" for someone else.

1271
01:43:16,216 --> 01:43:19,049
I beg you, let it be
a son of mine.

1272
01:43:19,091 --> 01:43:24,047
I am not moved to tears.

1273
01:43:24,048 --> 01:43:29,048
I have no sons. You have too
many sons. You don't need more.

1274
01:43:34,048 --> 01:43:36,047
Well, wish me luck.
I'm off.

1275
01:43:36,048 --> 01:43:39,047
To rome? That's where
they keep the pope.

1276
01:43:39,214 --> 01:43:42,046
You don't dare go!

1277
01:43:42,047 --> 01:43:44,964
Say that again at noon.
You'll say it to my horse's ass.

1278
01:43:45,006 --> 01:43:49,006
Lamb, I'll be rid of you by easter!
You can count your reigning days!

1279
01:43:49,047 --> 01:43:50,964
You go to rome,
we'll rise against you!

1280
01:43:51,006 --> 01:43:53,326
Who will? Richard, Geoffrey,
John and Eleanor of Aquitaine.

1281
01:43:54,005 --> 01:43:57,213
The day those stout hearts band
together is the day that pigs get wings!

1282
01:43:58,005 --> 01:44:01,005
There'll be pork in the treetops
come morning!

1283
01:44:02,255 --> 01:44:05,255
Don't you see you've given them
a common cause: New sons?

1284
01:44:06,005 --> 01:44:08,004
You leave the country,
and you've lost it.

1285
01:44:11,004 --> 01:44:15,004
- All of you at once?
- And Philip too. He'd join us.

1286
01:44:16,295 --> 01:44:18,295
Yes, he would.

1287
01:44:20,004 --> 01:44:24,003
Now how's your trip to rome?

1288
01:44:24,336 --> 01:44:28,961
Oh, I've got you,
got you, got you.

1289
01:44:29,003 --> 01:44:33,003
Should I take a thousand
men-at-arms, or is that showy?

1290
01:44:33,044 --> 01:44:35,336
Bluff away.

1291
01:44:35,378 --> 01:44:40,002
Ah, poor thing. How can I break
the news? You've just miscalculated.

1292
01:44:40,377 --> 01:44:42,377
Have I? How?

1293
01:44:43,002 --> 01:44:47,168
You should have lied. You should have
promised to be good while I was gone.

1294
01:44:47,210 --> 01:44:51,334
I would have let your three boys
loose. They could have fought me then.

1295
01:44:51,376 --> 01:44:53,376
You wouldn't keep your sons
locked up here.

1296
01:44:53,417 --> 01:44:55,334
Why the devil wouldn't I?
You wouldn't dare.

1297
01:44:55,376 --> 01:44:58,376
Why not? Let them sit in
Chinon for a while. I forbid it.

1298
01:44:58,626 --> 01:45:02,917
She forbids it. Did your father
sleep with me, or didn't he?

1299
01:45:04,958 --> 01:45:09,166
No doubt you're going to tell me
that he did. Would it upset you?

1300
01:45:09,208 --> 01:45:13,375
What about the thousand men? I
say be gaudy and to hell with it.

1301
01:45:13,416 --> 01:45:17,458
Don't leave me, Henry. I'm at rock
bottom. I'll do anything to keep you.

1302
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:20,915
I think you think you
mean it. Ask for something.

1303
01:45:20,957 --> 01:45:24,457
Eleanor, we're passed it, years
passed. Test me. Name an act.

1304
01:45:24,957 --> 01:45:28,457
There isn't one! About my
fornication with your father.

1305
01:45:28,499 --> 01:45:31,740
Yes, there is. You can expire. You first,
old man. I only hope I'm there to watch.

1306
01:45:31,957 --> 01:45:37,498
You're so afraid of dying. You're
so scared of it. Ah, poor Eleanor.

1307
01:45:37,956 --> 01:45:43,498
If only she'd lied. She did. She
said she never loved your father.

1308
01:45:43,539 --> 01:45:45,456
I can always count on you.

1309
01:45:45,498 --> 01:45:48,456
I never touched you without
thinking, "Geoffrey, Geoffrey."

1310
01:45:48,872 --> 01:45:51,830
The day you hurt me,
I'll cry out.

1311
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:54,830
I've put more horns on you
than Louis ever wore.

1312
01:45:54,872 --> 01:45:57,497
Am I supposed to care?
I'll kill you if you leave me.

1313
01:45:57,872 --> 01:46:03,495
You can try. I loved your
father's body. He was beautiful.

1314
01:46:03,496 --> 01:46:07,537
It never happened. I can see his
body now. Shall I describe it?

1315
01:46:07,579 --> 01:46:09,537
Eleanor, I hope you die!
His arms were rough,

1316
01:46:09,871 --> 01:46:11,496
with scars here.
No!

1317
01:46:11,537 --> 01:46:14,579
I can feel his arms!
I feel them!

1318
01:46:16,871 --> 01:46:20,828
I feel it!

1319
01:46:20,870 --> 01:46:23,578
What?
Have I hurt you?

1320
01:46:24,870 --> 01:46:26,828
Let me finish!

1321
01:46:26,870 --> 01:46:29,870
You were in the next room
when he did it!

1322
01:46:47,618 --> 01:46:49,576
Well,

1323
01:46:49,618 --> 01:46:53,826
what family doesn't have
its ups and downs?

1324
01:46:58,826 --> 01:47:00,659
I'm cold.

1325
01:47:01,825 --> 01:47:04,700
I can't feel anything.

1326
01:47:05,825 --> 01:47:07,825
Not anything at all.

1327
01:47:10,825 --> 01:47:15,742
We couldn't go back,
could we, Henry?

1328
01:47:20,824 --> 01:47:23,741
William!

1329
01:47:28,199 --> 01:47:32,198
Up! Up!

1330
01:47:39,948 --> 01:47:43,823
When the king is off his ass,
nobody sleeps!

1331
01:49:54,564 --> 01:49:56,689
Up! Up!

1332
01:49:57,563 --> 01:49:58,688
Up! Up!

1333
01:50:06,730 --> 01:50:09,688
Tell her to pack. She
leaves when it's light.

1334
01:50:29,728 --> 01:50:31,686
Up, up!

1335
01:52:31,595 --> 01:52:34,553
- Henry?
- We're packing up and moving out.

1336
01:52:34,595 --> 01:52:38,594
Is there a war? What's happened?
Henry, what's the matter?

1337
01:52:38,635 --> 01:52:40,594
Nothing, for a change.
Would you believe it?

1338
01:52:40,719 --> 01:52:44,510
Where have you been all night?
What for? Making us an entourage.

1339
01:52:44,552 --> 01:52:46,510
We're off to rome
to see the pope.

1340
01:52:47,510 --> 01:52:48,710
He's excommunicated you again.

1341
01:52:49,510 --> 01:52:53,508
No, he's going to set me free.
I'm having Eleanor annulled.

1342
01:52:53,509 --> 01:52:56,509
The nation will be shocked to learn
our marriage wasn't consummated.

1343
01:52:56,551 --> 01:52:58,508
Oh, be serious.
I am.

1344
01:52:58,509 --> 01:53:01,509
It seems that you and I
are getting married.

1345
01:53:03,509 --> 01:53:05,509
By the pope himself.

1346
01:53:09,508 --> 01:53:12,008
You mean it?

1347
01:53:12,050 --> 01:53:14,508
Shall I kneel?

1348
01:53:15,550 --> 01:53:21,508
It's not another trick? The bridal
party's drilling on the cobblestones.

1349
01:53:38,548 --> 01:53:42,506
- She'll find a way to stop us.
- How? She won't be here.

1350
01:53:42,548 --> 01:53:44,465
We're launching her for salisbury
tower when the winds change.

1351
01:53:44,506 --> 01:53:46,465
She'll be barging down
the river by lunchtime.

1352
01:53:46,506 --> 01:53:48,423
If she doesn't stop us,
Richard will.

1353
01:53:48,465 --> 01:53:52,464
Not anymore, I've corked him up. He's in
the cellar with his brothers and the wine.

1354
01:53:52,505 --> 01:53:56,464
The royal boys are aging with the
royal port. You haven't said yes.

1355
01:53:56,505 --> 01:53:58,422
Would you like
a formal declaration?

1356
01:53:58,464 --> 01:54:02,464
There, my finest angle.
It's on all the coins.

1357
01:54:03,505 --> 01:54:07,463
Sad alais, will you marry me?

1358
01:54:08,504 --> 01:54:11,421
Be my queen.

1359
01:54:11,463 --> 01:54:13,546
We'll love each other,
and you'll give me sons.

1360
01:54:14,463 --> 01:54:17,004
Let's have six. We'll
do Eleanor one better.

1361
01:54:17,046 --> 01:54:19,504
We'll call the first one
Louis, if you like.

1362
01:54:19,546 --> 01:54:23,462
Louis le premier. How's
that for a king of England?

1363
01:54:31,587 --> 01:54:34,462
Henry, you can't ever
let them out.

1364
01:54:35,462 --> 01:54:39,419
You've lost me. Let who out? Your sons.

1365
01:54:39,461 --> 01:54:44,544
You've put them in the dungeon, and
you've got to keep them there forever.

1366
01:54:45,586 --> 01:54:48,501
Do I now? If they're free when you die,

1367
01:54:48,502 --> 01:54:51,418
it's the dungeon
or the nunnery for me.

1368
01:54:52,418 --> 01:54:54,585
But, Henry,
what about the child?

1369
01:54:55,418 --> 01:54:57,418
Don't bother me about the child.
The damn thing isn't born yet.

1370
01:54:57,460 --> 01:54:59,376
If they're free,
they'll kill it.

1371
01:54:59,418 --> 01:55:04,626
And I will not live to see
our children murdered.

1372
01:55:09,417 --> 01:55:11,417
Henry!

1373
01:55:14,417 --> 01:55:16,667
Are you going down?

1374
01:55:20,416 --> 01:55:24,416
To let them out
or to keep them in?

1375
01:55:29,708 --> 01:55:33,708
Could you say
to a child of yours,

1376
01:55:33,749 --> 01:55:37,415
"you've seen the sunlight
for the last time"?

1377
01:55:39,748 --> 01:55:43,415
Can you do it, Henry?

1378
01:55:44,332 --> 01:55:47,707
I shall have to,

1379
01:55:47,748 --> 01:55:49,706
shan't I?

1380
01:58:38,236 --> 01:58:40,236
He's here.

1381
01:58:42,236 --> 01:58:46,694
He'll get no satisfaction out of
me. He isn't going to see me beg.

1382
01:58:46,735 --> 01:58:51,152
Why, you chivalric fool, as if
the way one fell down mattered.

1383
01:58:51,194 --> 01:58:54,152
When the fall is all there is,
it matters.

1384
01:59:14,150 --> 01:59:16,149
My barge is sailing
with the tide.

1385
01:59:16,150 --> 01:59:18,470
- I've come to say good-bye.
- Does Henry know you're here?

1386
01:59:19,150 --> 01:59:21,150
I've brought you each a little
something. What's he planning?

1387
01:59:21,525 --> 01:59:24,686
Is he going to keep us here? For God's
sake, mother. I picked it out especially.

1388
01:59:31,191 --> 01:59:33,149
- How heavy is the outside guard?
- That's taken care of.

1389
01:59:33,191 --> 01:59:36,190
The courtyard, the gates? They're putting
Henry's train together, and it's chaos.

1390
01:59:36,191 --> 01:59:38,149
You can walk right out. We'll go
to Poitiers. He'll expect that.

1391
01:59:38,191 --> 01:59:40,691
But we'll meet him with an army
when he comes. You stick close to me.

1392
01:59:40,732 --> 01:59:43,189
When you run, run hard. Why run
at all? I think we ought to stay.

1393
01:59:43,190 --> 01:59:46,189
Stay here? Till Henry comes.
He will come, won't he?

1394
01:59:46,190 --> 01:59:49,148
And he'll come alone.

1395
01:59:49,190 --> 01:59:51,689
I count three knives to
one. You think we could?

1396
01:59:51,690 --> 01:59:54,189
I'd only do it wrong.
You kill him, I'll watch.

1397
01:59:54,190 --> 01:59:56,231
- Where are you going?
- Up for air.

1398
01:59:56,273 --> 02:00:00,230
Don't stop her. You don't
think I'm gonna let this happen.

1399
02:00:00,272 --> 02:00:04,188
If you tell, there'll be a rash of
executions, and you don't want that.

1400
02:00:04,189 --> 02:00:06,314
No, you don't want to lose
one of us, not even me.

1401
02:00:07,189 --> 02:00:09,272
You're clever, but I
wonder if you're right.

1402
02:00:09,314 --> 02:00:13,188
Warn him, it's the end of us. You
warn him not, it's the end of him.

1403
02:00:13,229 --> 02:00:17,188
It's that clear.
Take the knives and run.

1404
02:00:17,229 --> 02:00:19,688
No, Geoffrey's right.

1405
02:00:19,729 --> 02:00:22,438
You're not an assassin.

1406
02:00:22,479 --> 02:00:25,146
Look again.
Richard.

1407
02:00:25,188 --> 02:00:28,394
Spare me that. You brought these
things. You want him dead? You do it.

1408
02:00:28,395 --> 02:00:31,353
You unnatural animal.

1409
02:00:31,395 --> 02:00:34,353
Unnatural, mummy? You tell
me, what's nature's way?

1410
02:00:34,395 --> 02:00:38,187
If poison mushrooms grow and
babies come with crooked backs,

1411
02:00:38,228 --> 02:00:40,145
if goiters thrive
and dogs go mad...

1412
02:00:40,187 --> 02:00:43,311
and wives kill husbands,
what's unnatural?

1413
02:00:43,352 --> 02:00:46,352
Come, here stands your lamb. Come
cover him in kisses. He's all yours.

1414
02:00:47,102 --> 02:00:52,061
No, you're not mine.
I'm not responsible.

1415
02:00:52,102 --> 02:00:55,102
Where do you think I learned this
from? Who do you think I studied under?

1416
02:00:55,144 --> 02:00:58,060
How old was I when you fought with
Henry first? Young. I don't know.

1417
02:00:58,101 --> 02:01:02,060
How many battles did I watch? But those
were battles, not a knife behind a door.

1418
02:01:02,101 --> 02:01:05,661
I never heard a corpse ask how it got so cold.
What were you thinking when you fought him?

1419
02:01:06,101 --> 02:01:08,435
You. I did it all for you!
Of your unnatural animal?

1420
02:01:08,476 --> 02:01:11,059
You wanted father dead.
No, never that.

1421
02:01:11,100 --> 02:01:15,100
You tried to kill him.
Why? What did you want? Yes!

1422
02:01:15,142 --> 02:01:18,475
I wanted Henry back.

1423
02:01:20,475 --> 02:01:22,475
Liar!

1424
02:01:24,100 --> 02:01:27,516
I wanted Henry.

1425
02:01:28,099 --> 02:01:31,516
Don't trust her. She'll
warn him if she gets a chance.

1426
02:01:36,099 --> 02:01:40,557
Dear, dear, whatever
shall we do with mother?

1427
02:02:18,138 --> 02:02:20,638
It wants light.

1428
02:02:25,637 --> 02:02:30,637
What we do in dungeons
needs the shades of day.

1429
02:02:33,054 --> 02:02:35,012
I stole the candles
from the chapel.

1430
02:02:35,054 --> 02:02:40,053
Jesus won't begrudge them,
and the chaplain works for me.

1431
02:02:40,094 --> 02:02:43,594
You look dreadful.
So do you.

1432
02:02:45,011 --> 02:02:47,636
I underslept a little.

1433
02:02:50,011 --> 02:02:52,969
We can all rest
in a little while.

1434
02:02:58,010 --> 02:03:01,677
There, that's better.

1435
02:03:02,010 --> 02:03:05,968
Bright and clear,
just like the morning.

1436
02:03:06,718 --> 02:03:08,967
Fine looking boy.

1437
02:03:12,717 --> 02:03:15,967
What do you want from us?
You must be mad.

1438
02:03:16,009 --> 02:03:19,967
Why did you have to come here?
Damn it, why did you come?

1439
02:03:20,759 --> 02:03:23,258
You were the best.

1440
02:03:23,300 --> 02:03:25,800
I told her so.

1441
02:03:26,008 --> 02:03:27,966
You, I loved.

1442
02:03:28,008 --> 02:03:30,966
You're going to keep us here.

1443
02:03:31,800 --> 02:03:35,841
You can't ever let me out.
You know you can't.

1444
02:03:35,883 --> 02:03:37,799
I'll never stop.

1445
02:03:38,840 --> 02:03:41,007
I can't stop either.

1446
02:04:11,297 --> 02:04:12,922
Brave boys...

1447
02:04:13,922 --> 02:04:15,922
that's what I have.

1448
02:04:22,462 --> 02:04:24,921
Come for me.

1449
02:04:47,878 --> 02:04:50,877
What's wrong?
You're Richard, aren't you?

1450
02:04:50,919 --> 02:04:52,835
But you're Henry.

1451
02:04:52,877 --> 02:04:57,877
Please, take me back.
Can't we try again?

1452
02:04:57,919 --> 02:04:59,877
Again?
We always have before.

1453
02:05:00,419 --> 02:05:04,877
Oh, yes, we always have.

1454
02:05:09,918 --> 02:05:12,876
Go on!

1455
02:05:21,958 --> 02:05:23,917
Execute him.

1456
02:05:26,875 --> 02:05:28,917
They're assassins, aren't they?

1457
02:05:29,958 --> 02:05:32,958
This was treason, wasn't it?

1458
02:05:33,875 --> 02:05:38,874
You gave them life.
You take it.

1459
02:05:45,791 --> 02:05:49,956
Who's to say it's monstrous?
I'm the king. I call it just.

1460
02:05:57,831 --> 02:05:59,998
Therefore, I, Henry,
by the grace of God,

1461
02:06:00,831 --> 02:06:04,789
King of the English, Lord of
Scotland, Ireland and Wales,

1462
02:06:04,997 --> 02:06:07,789
count of Anjou, Brittany,
Poutou and Normandy,

1463
02:06:07,997 --> 02:06:10,039
Maine, Gascony and Aquitaine,

1464
02:06:11,830 --> 02:06:14,789
do sentence you to death.

1465
02:06:14,830 --> 02:06:19,038
Done this Christmas day
in Chinon in God's year 1183.

1466
02:07:06,160 --> 02:07:08,743
Surely that's not
what I intended.

1467
02:07:12,201 --> 02:07:14,160
Children.

1468
02:07:15,743 --> 02:07:17,742
Children.

1469
02:07:21,742 --> 02:07:23,742
They're all we have.

1470
02:07:26,742 --> 02:07:28,742
Go on.

1471
02:07:30,242 --> 02:07:32,241
I'm done.

1472
02:07:34,741 --> 02:07:36,741
I'm finished with you.

1473
02:07:38,241 --> 02:07:40,283
You and I are finished.

1474
02:08:08,281 --> 02:08:12,697
You spare the rod,
you'll spoil those boys.

1475
02:08:18,696 --> 02:08:21,363
I couldn't do it, Eleanor.

1476
02:08:22,863 --> 02:08:25,696
Nobody thought you could.

1477
02:08:33,104 --> 02:08:35,404
Come rest.

1478
02:08:36,204 --> 02:08:41,404
I want no women in
my life. You're tired.

1479
02:08:41,595 --> 02:08:44,961
I could have conquered europe,
all of it,

1480
02:08:45,003 --> 02:08:47,611
but I had women in my life.

1481
02:08:49,611 --> 02:08:52,403
Go on, get out.
Go on.

1482
02:09:01,243 --> 02:09:04,702
I should have
killed you years ago.

1483
02:09:04,852 --> 02:09:09,443
You put me here. You made me
do mad things. You've bled me.

1484
02:09:09,652 --> 02:09:12,567
Shoulder it yourself.

1485
02:09:12,568 --> 02:09:15,184
Don't put it on my back.

1486
02:09:15,351 --> 02:09:18,609
Pick it up and carry it.
I can.

1487
02:09:19,284 --> 02:09:22,650
My losses are my work.

1488
02:09:22,651 --> 02:09:24,609
What losses?

1489
02:09:24,651 --> 02:09:27,484
I'm the one with nothing.

1490
02:09:27,651 --> 02:09:30,525
Lost your life's work,
have you?

1491
02:09:31,650 --> 02:09:34,649
Provinces are nothing.

1492
02:09:34,650 --> 02:09:37,608
Land is dirt.

1493
02:09:37,650 --> 02:09:42,865
I could take defeats like
yours and laugh. I've done it.

1494
02:09:42,907 --> 02:09:46,607
If you're broken,
it's because you're brittle.

1495
02:09:48,649 --> 02:09:51,607
I've lost.

1496
02:09:51,649 --> 02:09:54,407
You won.

1497
02:09:54,449 --> 02:09:58,606
And I can't ever
have you back again.

1498
02:10:00,648 --> 02:10:04,648
You're all
that I have ever loved.

1499
02:10:05,848 --> 02:10:10,470
Christ, you don't know
what nothing is.

1500
02:10:11,648 --> 02:10:14,547
- I want to die.
- No, you don't.

1501
02:10:14,588 --> 02:10:17,247
- I want to die.
- I'll hold you.

1502
02:10:17,288 --> 02:10:20,897
Henry, I want to die.
Eleanor.

1503
02:10:20,938 --> 02:10:23,547
I want to die.
Let me hold you.

1504
02:10:23,588 --> 02:10:26,347
I want to die.

1505
02:10:26,546 --> 02:10:29,604
You will, you know, someday.

1506
02:10:29,746 --> 02:10:32,029
Just wait long enough,
and it'll happen.

1507
02:10:37,146 --> 02:10:38,727
So it will.

1508
02:10:44,561 --> 02:10:47,906
We're in the cellar,
you're going back to prison,

1509
02:10:48,003 --> 02:10:51,516
my life is wasted,
we've lost each other,

1510
02:10:52,603 --> 02:10:54,411
and you're smiling.

1511
02:10:56,760 --> 02:11:00,870
It's the way
I register despair.

1512
02:11:03,560 --> 02:11:07,482
There's everything in life
but hope.

1513
02:11:09,960 --> 02:11:11,570
We're both alive.

1514
02:11:14,159 --> 02:11:16,447
And for all I know,
that's what hope is.

1515
02:11:25,600 --> 02:11:28,558
We're jungle creatures, Henry,

1516
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:34,558
and the dark is all around us.

1517
02:11:36,100 --> 02:11:40,398
See them...
in the corners?

1518
02:11:40,399 --> 02:11:42,235
You can see the eyes.

1519
02:11:51,016 --> 02:11:53,516
And they can see ours.

1520
02:12:03,415 --> 02:12:05,515
I'm a match for anything.

1521
02:12:06,615 --> 02:12:07,799
Aren't you?

1522
02:12:09,214 --> 02:12:12,843
I should have been
a great fool...

1523
02:12:12,955 --> 02:12:14,641
not to love you.

1524
02:12:32,813 --> 02:12:35,153
You'll let me out for easter?

1525
02:12:35,513 --> 02:12:39,112
Come the resurrection,
you can strike me down again.

1526
02:12:39,153 --> 02:12:41,012
Perhaps next time I'll do it.

1527
02:12:41,053 --> 02:12:42,512
And perhaps you won't.

1528
02:12:53,469 --> 02:12:57,369
You know, I hope we never die!

1529
02:12:57,411 --> 02:12:59,427
So do I.

1530
02:12:59,677 --> 02:13:02,469
You think there's
any chance of it?
