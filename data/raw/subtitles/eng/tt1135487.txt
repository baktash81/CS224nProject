were you gonna keep me waiting?

-I'm dying over there.
-Where?

There, by the Ben Franklin
potato salad pavilion.

00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,280
I'm sorry.
Are we supposed to know each other?

7
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:16,242
Definitely. I mean, we're supposed to.
We don't, but we should.

-Happy Independence Day.
-And to you.

00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,927
Look, I'm sorry. I don't know if it's the knee
or something, but I'm a little confused.

12
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,513
I thought we were checking each other out.

13
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,975
No. Sorry. Maybe you're drunk.

14
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,811
No, no, no.
If I was drunk, I'd be coming on to you.

That's a relief.

16
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:48,107
If I was drunk,
I'd be saying how amazing you look

17
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:50,735
and how crazy it is
that you're standing here on your own.

18
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,988
Wow. Are you always like this?

19
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:58,117
No. I sometimes sound like this,
but this is definitely different.

-What's so different?
-I don't know.

the Syrians or the Russians.

-Red, white and blue margaritas.
-Stay away from me.

-...I was waiting for them

I spent with you, the better.

-Oh, Jesus.
-How did you get on this project?

-And who the hell hired you anyway?

-I can't believe it.
-How did you get this job?

125
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,187
I got news for you, okay? The day I left MI6,

126
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,856
I had 1 5 major companies
begging for my services.

127
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,233
Well, I guess you picked wrong.
But you must be used to that.

128
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:41,778
-You know, I've got a meeting in 1 2 minutes.
-Where's the drop? Hand it over.

129

-Excuse me?

be my contact officer?

-This is way over your head.
-Over my head?

132
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,831
Lady, I worked Yemen, Athens and Cairo.

133
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,292
I've been promoted and decorated
every place I served.

134
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:56,835
Tell Duke to send someone else.

135
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,296
Listen. I'm sure you know your way
around a shoe store,

136
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:00,964
but I did 1 2 years in the field.

137
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,799
And how long have you been working
for Equikrom?

138
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,760
-Long enough.
-How long?

139
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,888
Three weeks.

140
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:12,935
Three whole weeks? Like every day?

141
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:17,189
Well, I've spent the last 1 4 months
undercover inside Burkett & Randle.

142
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:21,109
I'm an Assistant Director
of Counterintelligence. I am all the way in.

143
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:24,863
So let's get this straight.
I'm the asset here. You're a delivery boy.

144
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:26,949
And the only thing I'm gonna give you
is a message.

145
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:30,077
Tell Duke I don't ever wanna see you again.

146
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:34,206
I run field agents for a living.
There's only two ways to do it.

147
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,332
Either you bring them flowers

148
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,501
or you hang them by their heels
out of the window.

149
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:40,879
Now, maybe you're so used to having
your legs in the air you don't realize it,

150
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:43,549
but you're upside down, sister.

151
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:44,883
I own you.

152
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:50,097
-You've 1 0 seconds to get your hand off me.
-Or what? You won't be my friend anymore?

153
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:54,101
I like this gig.
I like the money. I like the hours.

154
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,478
So I'm not going anywhere,
and you're gonna get over it

155
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,273
because if you ever mention again
that you don't wanna work with me

156
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:02,901
or that we've met before or that you think
someone else might do a better job,

157
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:05,696
if I get replaced for any reason at all,

158
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,031
I'm gonna call those suckers
over at Burkett & Randle

159
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:12,703
and tell them they have an Equikrom spy
in the heart of their security team.

160
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:18,375
Be a shame to let the last 1 4 months
go down the drain, wouldn't it?

161
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,839
So where's my package?

162
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:33,265
Tell Duke this is the one
he's been waiting for.

163
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:37,894
-You screw this up, I'll ruin your life.
-I thought you tried that already.

164
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,902
RAY: You wanna take one last shot
at that apology?

165
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,096
Okay. Thank you.

166
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,578
What'd she say exactly?
I mean, her exact words.

167
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:40,707
She said, "Tell Duke
this is the one he's been waiting for."

168
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,589
-PAM: Do you wanna do it?
-Go ahead.

169
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,761
DUKE: Easy. Just...
Just, you know, pull it out.

170
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,680
-Slowly. Slowly, slowly.
-Duke.

171
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,556
All right, go ahead.

172
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,232
Pam, Pam, easy, don't tear it.
Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, just... Careful.

173
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,942
-For Christ's sake, Duke, keep your shirt on.
-Just...

174
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,278
Do something useful.
Punch up Tully's fingerprints.

175
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:13,281
Wow. Look at this.

176
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,118
So is this the big one?

177
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:21,915
-I gotta call Garsik right away.
-PAM: Yeah.

178
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,627
DUKE: Come on.
I need a secure line at Equikrom.

179
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,941
-How are you?
-Good. How are you?

180
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,833
CLAlRE: Houston.
This was over the weekend.

181
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,001
NED: Who are they?

182
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:10,839
Researchers at the fragrance lab down there,
when they're not dealing ecstasy.

183
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,674
Track it.

184
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:18,430
West Coast Market Coordinator
of the Floor Wax Division.

185
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:22,100
Came back from lunch on Friday,
handed in his resignation.

186
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:23,935
-Unexpected?
-Very.

187
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,605
Three kids in private school,
he just remortgaged his house,

188
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,607
-and the wife has a heart condition.
-All right.

189
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:33,028
Well, get his financials, phone, e-mail,
and get the wife's prognosis.

190

CLAIRE: Senior V.P., Medical Disposables.
He called in Sunday,

191
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,285
lost his laptop in the Denver Airport.

192
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,870
Why does this guy look familiar?

193
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:45,832
He had a briefcase
full of sales projections stolen last year.

194
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:49,336
-Is this the guy who bought the boat?
-Same guy.

195
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:53,632
-All right. Get a team up his ass tonight.
-I sent them this morning.

(PHONE RINGING)

197
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,552
We're in a meeting.

198
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,389
Now? Everyone?

199
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,477
Well, did they say why?

200
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:12,567
It's Tully. Mr. Tully's coming down.

201
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,904
He wants the entire floor gathered
in five minutes.

202
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,692
AIDE: Dick, it's just that you have
a very busy scheduIe today.

203
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,110
RICHARD: Yeah, well, something's come up.

204
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,363
AIDE: There's the dandruff shampoo
marketing presentation at 3:00.

205
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,866
-Cancel.
-They're in the building.

206
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,950
Make it tomorrow.

207
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:05,370
The nail polish R&D group from Germany
is at 3:45.

208
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,538
Reschedule.

209
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,540
You've got a premium diaper teleconference

210
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,208
-at 4: 1 5.
-Tape it.

211
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:12,794
The nasal decongestant
rebranding numbers are in.

212
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,046
-They wanted 1 5 minutes at around...
-Cancel!

213
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:18,967
And the toothpaste. And the car wax dinner.
Cancel it all.

214
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,933
RICHARD: All right, let's have a look at me.

215
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,565
There should be another vehicle.

216
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,567
Yeah. Change of plans.
You're going with them.

217
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:39,821
Everybody's going. Let's go, come on.
Get out there and sell it, folks!

218
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,949
Go, go, go! Come on!
Get the hell out of here!

(TIRES SCREECHING)

220
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,627
Get out! Leave it running.
Leave it running. I'm driving.

221
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,265
DALE: This is starting to look pretty good.

222
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,768
DUKE: I can't even tell them apart.
Which one is the new one?

223
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,186
Right here.

224
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:14,189
-This is 1 6.
-That's a match.

225

Boris, handwriting?

226
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:23,031
Hundred percent. It's Howard Tully.

227
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:26,117
DUKE: All right.
Burkett & Randle, here we come!

228
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,285
Guys?

229
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:33,291
RICHARD: Duke? I'm locked out. Again.

230
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,420
Yeah, I'm standing right outside.

231
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:41,841
Of course it's me!
Who the hell else has this number?

232
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:45,345
Yeah, okay. Duke, you know,
for all the money that I'm spending on this,

233
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:48,181
you could've given me a code
that I can remember.

234
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,307
Sir!

235
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,194
What the hell is this?

236
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,912
Why are we here?

237
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,709
We are here today
because the ruIes have changed.

238
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:21,840
We're here because the fabric of integrity
has been so abused and mangIed

239
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:25,051
that it is little more
than a threadbare memory.

240
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:30,265
We're here because it's no Ionger enough
to have the best ideas,

241
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:35,228
or the best manufacturing,
or the best pipeIine to deIiver your product.

"We're here today because we find ourselves
in a world where duplicity and theft

"are tested daily as replacements
for innovation and perseverance."

(LAUGHING)

245
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,785
"Tested daily." What a bunch of crap.
Can you believe this?

246
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:55,290
This from a guy who bought a dump
so he could go through our garbage.

247
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,792
I beIieve the history
of all successful endeavors

248
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:02,422
can be reduced to a series
of decisive moments.

249
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,050
"There are moments in the history
of all things

250
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:07,635
"where the placement of a single..."

251
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:11,056
...where the pIacement of a singIe moIecuIe
can make the difference

252
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,641
between triumph and catastrophe.

253
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:16,144
I mean, who the hell writes
with a fountain pen anymore?

254
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,064
For Christ's sake.
How fricking pretentious is that?

255
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,816
This room we're in now,
this entire program,

256
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:25,737
was created in anticipation
ofjust such a moment.

257
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:29,157
You peopIe are the very best at what you do.

258
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:35,622
You were chosen by that standard.
You've been paid and treated accordingIy.

259
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:42,170
And you have never been tested
as you are about to be tested.

260
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:46,508
"Burkett & Randle will be rolling out
a new product

261
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:51,513
"in the very near future."

262
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,141
And while l cannot reveal
the nature of this product,

263
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:59,562
beIieve me when I teII you that simpIy
by announcing its deveIopment...

264
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:05,860
"...B&R will be dramatically repositioned
at the summit of the global marketplace."

265
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:09,239
I don't need to expIain to anybody
in this room

266
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:12,909
why the scope, the detaiIs,
the very existence of this project

267
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:15,328
must be so carefuIIy protected.

268
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,748
I expect your best in days to come,

269
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:23,711
and I promise you,
if we stay focused and vigiIant,

270
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:26,089
we will, all of us...

00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:28,842
"...prosper."

Dick? Dick? Don't go dark on me now.

274
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,229
Dick!

275
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:46,609
We gotta stay positive. Hey, look around.

276
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:48,361
This is why we're here.

277
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:52,073
When you came to me,
that first conversation, this is it.

278
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,576
This is why we built the unit.

279
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:57,871
-I know what he's doing.
-Dick. Dick!

280
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,999
Look at me.
This is a great team we've got here.

281

RICHARD: Mmm-hmm.

282
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:05,295
Yeah. We are so prepped.
We are so ready to deploy.

283
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:08,464
You say the word,
you unleash the beast, Dick.

284
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:11,968
-We will tear this thing apart.
-He's just timing the blow, Duke.

285
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:17,056
-No. Wrong. We caught a break here.
-We caught a break? You call this a break?

286
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,852
I got a shareholders' convention
in nine days.

287
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,145
Hey, man, he's not thinking about that.

288
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,521
Oh!

289
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:27,775
Are you out of your fricking mind?
That is all that he thinks about.

290
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,322
And believe you me, if he has got a knife,
that is when he's gonna use it,

291
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:35,325
because that's what I'd do! Yeah.

292
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:39,454
No, I would wait till he is right in the middle
of a big old standing ovation.

293
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:44,542
I would wait till he is just so overwhelmed
with beloved waves of adoration,

294
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:47,170
he couldn't even hear the sound
of his own cojones

295
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:49,464
as they hit the goddamn floor!

296
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,136
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

297
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,809
Oh, my God, he is gonna crush me.

298
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,105
Tell your people not to make vacation plans.

299
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,399
-They're gonna wanna know why.
-Then they're in the wrong business.

300
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,944
How are we supposed to work it up
if we don't know what we're protecting?

301
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:13,988
Look, I don't know. Assume it's everything.

302
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:19,953
B&R's mainframe network is a beast.

303
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:23,539
I mean, we've spent
the last 1 0 months probing.

304
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:24,832
We got nowhere.

305
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,876
I mean, the encryption
and system awareness codes

306
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:30,797
are tactically equivalent
to anything we had at the Pentagon.

307
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:37,053
The good news is 200 photocopiers
that B&R purchased last month.

308
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:39,180
We paid a little visit down to the vendor,

309
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:43,393
and we made a few adjustments
to one of the units before it shipped.

310
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:46,437
Call this the Ghost.

311
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:49,440
It's not fast, it's not easy,
but this device right here

312
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,526
allows us to hijack signal traffic

313
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:54,654
without leaving
any electronic residue behind.

314
00:26:55,030 --> 00:27:01,035
Here. Right now we're hacking a photocopier
in their Human Resources Department.

315
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:06,040
I mean, we're still mapping, but look,
we're tapped into 1 2 units already.

316
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,876
PAM: The B&R Research
and Development Unit in Westchester

317
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:12,547
hasn't brought a major new product
to market since 1 997.

318
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:16,092
In spite of that,
we made it a surveillance priority.

319
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:18,428
Number one, we graph the volume of traffic

320
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:20,930
and the quality of vehicles
in that parking lot.

321
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:24,058
Number two, we track the stock portfolios
and mortgage payments

322
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,393
of everybody on site.

323
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:28,438
And, number three, we monitor
the frequency of Internet shopping

324
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,481
and pornography searches
from inside that lab.

325
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:34,986
Stocks are down, porn is up
and there's plenty of free parking.

326
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,113
There's nothing going on here.

327
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,782
We're confident
that whatever this new product is,

328
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,701
it comes from outside the company.

329
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,161
The moment this meeting breaks up,

330
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:47,040
we'll be going over every acquisition
B&R has made in the past 1 8 months.

331
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:48,583
We'll find it.

332
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:52,086
FETYOV: This B&R building is very strong
with security.

333
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,631
Is the same for us like the computer.

334
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:57,967
We are all the time feeling our way
around this building,

335
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,094
but not getting anywhere.

336
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:04,599
Then we make a big discovery.
Travel Department is not in the big building.

337
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:10,146
Travel Department is four blocks away
and this building is very different.

338
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:14,734
-(CHUCKLES) Very simple and very basic.
-Yeah, it's a gold mine, Dick.

339
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,819
They basically handle
all of B&R's commercial travel,

340
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:21,866
so every private jet, car, boat, hotel,
housing, everything goes through them.

341
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,995
The boys have got some great ideas
on how to get us on the inside.

342
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:29,290
Very simple and very basic.

No, I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.

Don't start that again. Translate that?

348

-You're always kidding.
-I'm not. I'm a very serious guy.

00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,534

353
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,478
Hi. Remember me?

354
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,274
-Yes, I...
-Gotcha.

355
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:45,194
-I'm sorry, I just...
-Just what?

356
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:47,989
-I'm drawing a blank.
-Don't even try it.

357
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,699
-Excuse me?
-Can I make a suggestion?

358
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:52,410
A little professional courtesy
would make this a lot less awkward.

359
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:56,038
-How do I know you?
-How do you know me?

360
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,624
Wow. That's a strong play.

361
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:00,710
Believe me, I've spent a lot of time
thinking what this would be like,

362
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:03,337
where we'd be, what I'd say, what you'd say,

363
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,006
-but I never thought that you'd...
-I'm sorry. I just...

You really wanna go this way?

365
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,217
Look, you clearly have me confused
with someone else.

366
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,261
I don't know, I'm not great on names.
I should be. I try.

367
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,597
Faces, I'm definitely better.

00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:22,189
You talk me up, seduce me, screw me,

372
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,401
then you drug me and ransack
my hotel room.

373
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,653
And how sick is this? The last thing
I remember before I passed out

374
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:28,821
was how much I liked you.

375
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,740

-I... No, I...

-It's...

-This is unacceptable.
-No, you're right. You're right.

00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,552
It's not funny. Seriously. Completely.

-And it's not you. It's not you.
-What the hell does that mean?

00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:59,352
It's tension. Nerves.
Nervous laughter, obviously.

00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:03,064
Your knee. Wow. All better, huh?

387
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:07,818
Yeah, with that brace and everything,
you really looked like you were hurting.

was hanging out because of you?

393
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:22,875
It's... I don't know. The laughter.
I don't know what that's about. It's about...

Remorse. Just a lot of things.

396
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:35,680
I mean, I'm assuming you know
by now that I was

397
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:39,850
working for the Agency,
so, yeah, there's that.

398
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:42,019
-This sucks.
-Yeah.

399
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:43,562

00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:45,940

00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:50,695

Oh, Jesus! This can't be happening.
This is not the day to not get a wake-up call.

420
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:33,440
Oh, God!
I can't believe I didn't get my wake-up call.

00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:35,734

I'm supposed to be landing
in Geneva right now.

423
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:41,198
You probably told me all this.
I just don't remember it.

00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:44,326
No. I couldn't. It's classified.

425
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,955
Yeah, I was supposed to be in Cairo
two days ago.

426
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:51,000
-You told me London.
-The point is, I blew it off.

427
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:52,918
And nobody called this morning?

00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:55,588
-You were here.
-I'm a heavy sleeper.

I took the call and didn't tell you?

430
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,301
When did you set this up, anyway?

431
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:01,969
CLAIRE: Last night.
RAY: Where was I?

432
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:03,596

-When I went for the ice.

00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,646
You snuck out of the tub
to leave a wake-up call!

CLAIRE: This is a five-star hotel.
How does that happen?

438
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:19,278
Welcome to Italy.

439
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:26,160

I shouldn't have to explain this to you.

Well, this beats the hell out of Dubai.

441
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,624

-I'm still standing, right?

442
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,044
There. See? There it is.

-See, I knew it.

445

You'll never get over that, will you?
You couldn't.

446
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,010
I'm afraid that's classified.

447
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:46,013
-You actually think, what, I'm playing you?
-That's crazy, right?

448
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:48,557
This felt like an assignment to you?
Three days? All this?

449
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,809
What was the objective? Rug burn?

450
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:54,355
Who knows, maybe you didn't want me
in Cairo yesterday.

451
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:57,650
God, that's so sad.

452
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,570
Because that's exactly
what I was just thinking.

453
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,073
That maybe you're playing me,
that you canceled my call.

454
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:07,910
That this was just some revenge
to get back at me for Dubai.

455
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:12,498
Then I'm thinking how terrible it is
that I think that way.

456
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:15,376
Then I realize we both think that way.

457
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:19,546
Then I'm thinking,

458
00:38:20,674 --> 00:38:23,217
is that what makes this so worth it?

459
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,053
Is that it?

460
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:31,392
That I know you're thinking
exactly what I'm thinking?

461
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:36,438
Because then I'm thinking, do we both
think like that because of what we do?

462
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,566
Are we good at what we do
because we think like that?

463
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:41,986
Everybody thinks like that.
They just don't say it.

464
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:45,114
-Civilians don't think like that.
-Bullshit.

465
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:49,952
-Nobody trusts anybody. We just cop to it.
-Okay. So cop to it.

466
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,997
-Me? I think you better go first.
-Why? What am I hiding?

467
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:55,416
This wasn't an accident, was it?

468
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,627
Being here. Meeting like this.

469
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,464
You came looking for me, didn't you?

470
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,843
-You'd like that, wouldn't you?
-I'm right, though, aren't I?

471
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:08,137
Because you went looking for me, right?

472
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,389
But why? Just for this?

473
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,808
-Isn't that enough?
-Not for you.

474
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:16,228
What are we into, Claire?

475
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:21,108
Can you imagine living like this?

476
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:25,446
-How much fun we could have?
-Aren't we in enough trouble?

477
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:27,823
I mean, having the money.

478
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,952
-Keep going.
-How much do you think we'd need?

479
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:37,124
-$20 million?
-I was thinking 40.

480
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:43,297
So what do you have to do
to get $40 million?

481
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:46,800
Go private.

482
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,677
Be smart.

483
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,554
Get lucky.

484
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,097
How smart?

485
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:55,809
Smart enough to pick the right partner.

486
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:59,271
-Private, you mean...
-Corporate.

487
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,689
And lucky?

488
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,027
Be someplace when something's happening.

489

-They must have tried to talk you out of it.
-Not really, no.

656
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:33,089
Well, they can't be happy to see you go.
It couldn't have been that easy.

657
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:35,508
What are you trying to tell me?

658
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:39,304
-You didn't do it, did you?
-Hang on.

659
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:41,681
There's no way
that they just let you just walk out.

660
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:44,809
-Wait.
-You just punched out? Just walked out?

661
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:46,102
No, no, no, no, no. Hang on.

662
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:48,104
-Answer the question.
-Did they ask you to stay?

663
00:51:48,189 --> 00:51:49,939
-You're ducking the question.
-They did, didn't they?

664
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:52,108
-This is classic.
-They asked you to stay.

665
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:54,235
-I know this drill, okay.
-Did you quit or not?

666
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,029
Deny everything. Admit nothing.

667
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,281
-Make counter-accusations.
-That's what you're doing.

668
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,492
I asked you how it went and you evaded!

669
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:04,454
How it went?
I just terminated a 1 2-year career with MI6.

670
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,247
I spent an hour
signing non-disclosure forms,

671
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,625
I did a quick outplacement polygraph,
I turned in my credentials

672
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:10,543
and I walked out
on the only job I've ever really had,

673
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:13,505
and now, right now,
I'm getting the very distinct impression

674
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:18,051
that you changed your mind,
kept your job, and left me out in the cold.

675
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:20,512
They kind of begged me to stay.

676
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:23,765
And you don't call
to tell me that this morning?

677
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:25,600
I couldn't risk it.

678
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:27,977
You're unbelievable.

679
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:31,397
-I was completely surprised.
-I don't believe this.

680
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,859
I hope you kept your passports.

681
00:52:34,944 --> 00:52:36,653
What am I supposed to do? I can't go back.

682
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:38,822
You have to turn in a couple
to make it look good, but...

683
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:40,406
I am totally cooked.

684
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:42,784
...we're gonna need decent passports.

685
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:45,078
What are you talking about?

686
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:48,540
I took everything I could get my hands on.

687
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:50,500
After they begged me.

688
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,796
You bitch.

689
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,515
(WHISPERS) Admit it.
You don't trust me, either.

690
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:28,288
So, the total footprint.

691
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:32,333
That's if you're interested in both buildings,
'cause they're both available right now.

692
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:37,463
It's about 22,000 square feet.
The ventilation, it's zoned.

693
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:42,969
And you've got separate filtration systems
for the lab, office, storage and loading.

694
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,722
-It's lovely and clean.
-Yes, indeed.

695
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:49,017
The last tenants left the place
in terrific shape. It's just spotless.

696
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:50,685
What kind of business were they in?

697
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:55,189
REALTOR: Formavale? Damned if I know.
Some kind of biotech.

698
00:53:55,316 --> 00:53:58,318
They took the place, loaded in their gear
and that's about the last we saw of them.

699
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:01,487
Hell, they used to truck out their own trash.

700
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:07,660
Cronin Partiz. Ronnie Partiz.

701
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:10,204
Dr. Ronald Partiz.

702
00:54:10,331 --> 00:54:12,874
This is 1 0 years ago up in Albany.

703
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:17,045
He's graduating high school,
1 5 years old in that picture,

704
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:18,963
but he's a smart kid.

705
00:54:19,048 --> 00:54:21,299
He gets a free ride to Cornell.

706
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,468
He finds his way
into the biochemistry department.

707
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:25,136
Two years later, he's in med school.

708
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:27,931
PAM: He's 1 8, he's doing research
with some heavy hitters,

709
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:30,892
he's getting good evaIuations,
he's roIIing aIong.

710
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:36,189
1 999, he publishes an article in a magazine
called American DermatoIogist.

711
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:39,025
-About?
-Something about a fungus.

712
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:41,194
What kind of fungus?

713
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,445
DUKE: lt doesn't matter.

714
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,197
RlCHARD: Doesn't matter?
Everything matters.

715
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:48,117
He plagiarized it. He stole it.
He got caught immediately.

716
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:52,163
PAM: They bounced him out of Cornell.
He set up shop in his parents' garage,

717
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:55,333
started working on some kind of skin cream.

718
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:57,043
DUKE: Yeah, something called...

719
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,544
-What?
-PAM: Spring Skin.

720
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:01,547
He tried to sell it to health food stores
in the area up there.

721
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:04,384
Now, you're sure this is a cream
or was it a lotion?

722
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:07,595
-Because a lot of people confuse the two.
-I don't know.

723
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:12,433
Well, for Christ's sake, Duke, let's have that!
Let's have that! I mean, if...

724
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,895
If there is even a chance that this guy
is Tully's secret weapon,

725
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:18,856
we're gonna need a hell of a lot more
than his goddamn grade point average!

726
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:22,443
You gotta get me his cream!
Show me the cream!

727
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:26,280
Dick, he went bankrupt overnight.
It was a bust, okay.

728
00:55:26,407 --> 00:55:30,159
We don't think the cream
is the answer here.

729
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:33,246
So, Ronnie Partiz
now goes deep underground.

730
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:36,582
2002, 2003, nothing.

731
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:40,336
It's as if he doesn't exist.
No taxes, no bank records, nothing.

732
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:44,132
Then, two years ago,
he walks into a bank in Atlanta

733
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:50,847
and produces a $500,000 letter of credit
and a business card from Formavale.

734
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,099
DUKE: Now, we've been working hard,
we've been working fast

735
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,934
and yet we can't find anything
about Formavale.

736
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:57,353
We don't have a vendor,
we don't have an insurance company,

737
00:55:57,438 --> 00:55:58,771
we don't have anybody down there

738
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:01,524
who knows anything about
what the hell Formavale does.

739
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,985
PAM: We're working these
New York travel records.

740
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:06,821
Howard Tully bouncing down to Dunwoody
like a busboy.

741
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:11,325
DUKE: Yeah, and two days after RonaId Partiz
sells Formavale Labs to B&R,

742
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:13,453
three armored trucks
puII up outside the buiIding.

743
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:16,664
PAM: Not only that,
B&R sends a security detail down there

744
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,125
to guard the Ioad out,
which takes pIace at night.

745
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:22,420
And consider that B&R has yet to disclose
their financial statements

746
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:23,755
showing the acquisition.

747
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:28,509
And then add the fact that Ronnie Partiz
has been living for the last six months

748
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:34,932
in a $10,000-a-day penthouse suite
at the Atlantis Hotel in the Bahamas.

749
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:38,519
And the coup de grâce,
toss in the fact that he is playing baccarat

750
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,980
whenever he's sober enough
to make his way down to the tabIes

751
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:43,566
to the tune of $300,000 a week.

752
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,944
Duke, God damn it,
you gotta stop waltzing around,

753
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:49,572
and you have got to get on this guy.

754
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,610
You can forget his room.

755
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:31,531
It's like Fort Knox up there.
It'd be a major operation.

756
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:34,700
-I told you.
-So what do you wanna do?

757
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,371
Have a drink.

758
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,697

760
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:22,850
This is a waste of time.
You wanna just sit here all night?

761
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:26,979
Look at him, he's paralyzed.
He couldn't leave if he wanted to.

762
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:32,109
Why don't you give me the credit card,
let me get in the game.

763
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:34,278
It's a $5,000 table.

764
00:59:34,363 --> 00:59:37,031
That's okay. I'll share my winnings.

765
00:59:37,658 --> 00:59:38,991

00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:59,095
Maybe tonight he goes nowhere.

768
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,555
What we do?

769
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:04,725
Tonight we watch like this, and tomorrow...

770
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:09,522
Tomorrow, we'll find somebody
who works upstairs in those rooms, okay?

-SECURITY: Glad to hear it.

-By who?

I was probably just being paranoid.

Well, that's crazy. Nobody knows we're here.

what else to do. I had to run it out.

01:03:26,428 --> 01:03:29,430
We get involved, we lead the charge.
When the price is right, we ditch.

817
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:31,348
All we gotta do is find an angle.

818
01:03:31,433 --> 01:03:34,226
Maybe we flip sides,
maybe we shop the intel,

819
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:38,147
buy stock, sell it, whatever.
There's a hundred ways to go.

820
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:40,191
There's this company
called Butter Mills, okay.

821
01:03:40,275 --> 01:03:41,609
Now, about two months ago,

822
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:45,779
the CEO, Mr. Butter Mills, sitting at home,
watching TV with his granddaughter.

823
01:03:45,906 --> 01:03:47,448
There's this ad
comes on in the morning cartoons

824
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:49,950
for something called Double Crust Pizza.

825
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,536
This guy's been working on
double-crust pizza for five years,

826
01:03:52,621 --> 01:03:56,165
got $50 million invested,
major new product for him.

827
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:59,084
Trouble is, he hasn't rolled it out yet.

828
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:03,339
The ad he's watching
is for Flakey Fresh Double Crust.

829
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:08,010
They stole his concept, his formula,
his packaging and his ad campaign.

830
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:09,637
So Mr. Butter Mills is out for blood.

831
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:12,014
They're taking off the gloves.
They're bringing out the check book.

832
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:13,724
Here's the best part...

833
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:17,269
Guess who they like
for Director of Intel Operations?

834
01:04:17,646 --> 01:04:19,605
I took a job yesterday.

835
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:23,526
-What?
-That's why I was paranoid.

836
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:28,072
What do you mean, you took a job?

837
01:04:28,156 --> 01:04:30,950
It's not like I could call and tell you.

838
01:04:31,326 --> 01:04:33,202
I don't believe this.

839
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:36,288
What happened to doing it together?

840
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:38,916
-Well, it was just too good...
-No, we had a plan.

841
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,960
You know, we agreed.
We said we'd go over everything.

842
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:44,672
We go over it. We do it together.
We said nobody moves alone.

843
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:47,174
-Ray, please.
-Well, can you get out of it?

844
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:51,428
Well, of course you can.
You haven't even started yet. Claire...

845
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:53,556
Claire, look, I know that we said
that we're gonna go out there,

846
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,266
get two jobs
and see which one comes up best,

847
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,768
but with this, the pizza,

848
01:04:57,852 --> 01:05:00,854
I mean, we can push up the whole timetable.
It's perfect.

849
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:02,856
And we can be together.

850
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,860
Look, I take the job,
you start working out the exit strategy.

851
01:05:06,987 --> 01:05:10,239
You know, you build up our ID, you set up
the banks, offshore trading accounts.

852
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:13,576
Whatever we need, you get it
up and running and then I bring you in, see.

853
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,536
I'm gonna need to staff up.
You'll apply, we'll meet.

854
01:05:15,662 --> 01:05:19,498
We'll like each other, hate each other,
whatever works best.

855
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:23,252
Who'd you take the job with?

856
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:25,087
Equikrom.

857
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:28,007
-Local?
-New York.

858
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:31,427
It's two jobs actually.

859
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:34,179
Equikrom wants to hire me under the table,

860
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:36,724
and then get me a job
on the counterintelligence desk

861
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:38,767
for Burkett & Randle.

862
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:41,061
They want you to be a mole?

863
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,355
Equikrom?

864
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:45,899
In New York?

865
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,904
Where's the pizza thing?

866
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:54,074
Cleveland.

867
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:58,412
You said they offered you the job.

868
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,999
Of course they did. They love me.

869
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:05,044
-You took it on the spot.
-What, like you?

870
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:09,214
Nothing was formalized.

871
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:15,888
CLAIRE: Look, seriously,
I don't have to take it.

872
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:18,223
Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

873
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:21,060
CLAIRE: How are we ever
gonna see each other?

874
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:23,145
RAY: Very, very carefully.

875
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:28,400
CLAIRE: This is what we wanted, right?

876
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:31,236
RAY: I think so.

877
01:06:33,573 --> 01:06:34,907
CLAIRE: Come here.

878
01:06:53,218 --> 01:06:54,718
Ms. Stenwick?

879
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:02,434
HOWARD: Someone made fire.

880
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:06,105
Someone was first.

881
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:10,859
I don't mean the idiot who found
a burning stick and kept it going.

882
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:13,612
I mean the fellow who could make fire.

883
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:18,534
And until that knowledge was stolen,

884
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:23,455
that fellow was the most powerful person
on the planet.

885
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:29,044
And it means something to be first.

886
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:31,755
To be most.

887
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,801
It means a great deal.

888
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:41,306
It means you have an opportunity
to reproduce with the highest frequency

889
01:07:41,433 --> 01:07:44,143
and with the most desirable partners.

890
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:48,063
It means your offspring
have the greatest chance of survival

891
01:07:48,148 --> 01:07:51,400
and a better opportunity
to make their own fire.

892
01:07:52,152 --> 01:07:55,738
I personally believe that human evolution
has run its course.

893
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:58,240
We live in a world where the people
who can make fire

894
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:00,159
have a tendency to wear condoms,

895
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:03,495
sit in casinos
and drink themselves into a stupor.

896
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:08,500
I believe that individual evolution
has been replaced by something else.

897
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:11,503
By a shared evolution.

898
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:15,132
A communal contest, if you will.

899
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:19,178
I believe, Ms. Stenwick,
in corporate evolution.

900
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:24,683
I believe that the corporation that is first,
that is the most,

901
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:27,936
has an opportunity to manufacture
with the highest frequency

902
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:30,189
and in the most desirable markets,

903
01:08:30,315 --> 01:08:32,441
and that its shareholders, by extension,

904
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:36,361
have the greatest chance of survival
and reinvestment.

905
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:42,534
I don't imagine you're quite aware
of the service

906
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:46,622
you and Mr. Bauer
provided this corporation last night.

907
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:49,124
We were just doing our job, sir.

908
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:52,044
Mr. Partiz may appear a fool,

909
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:53,796
(LAUGHING)

910
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,881
but he is anything but.

911
01:08:56,007 --> 01:09:00,302
He has given Burkett & Randle a gift
that will change our business,

912
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:02,888
our lives, forever.

913
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:06,892
So the question, Ms. Stenwick,

914
01:09:07,018 --> 01:09:11,897
is whether you can continue to do the job
we so desperately need you to do

915
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:15,484
without knowing the stakes involved.

916
01:09:16,027 --> 01:09:20,823
Can you really do your job without knowing
what it is that you're protecting?

917
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:28,747
What I need to know is,

918
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:35,003
can I share my fire with you?

919
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:42,261
DUKE: Little trouble out there
in the field, Ray?

920
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:43,345
RAY: What do you mean?

921
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:46,098
DUKE: Well, I just got
a back channel message from Claire,

922
01:09:46,224 --> 01:09:47,766
she wants to meet Garsik.

923
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:49,101
RAY: That's a terrible idea.

924
01:09:49,227 --> 01:09:52,771
DUKE: Yeah, that's what I told him.
But now he wants direct contact.

925
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:54,231
RAY: Forget it.

926
01:09:57,277 --> 01:10:00,279
-It's his dime.
-Yeah, and she's my agent.

927
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:03,532
I told you when I came on board.
Once she's mine, I run her my way.

928
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:08,245
Yeah, well the question's been raised, Ray,
is it just her you're running?

929
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:13,792
You'd better explain that to me.

930
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:19,131
RAY OVER PHONE: American Consulate,
Dubai, you and me, Fourth of JuIy, 2003.

931
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:20,465
CLAlRE OVER PHONE:
Find someone else to bother.

932
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:22,718
RAY: Red, white and bIue margaritas.
CLAlRE: Stay away from me.

933
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:27,639
RAY: I had a knee brace, you had toe rings.
First toe ring I ever saw, by the way.

934
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:32,477
Well, I'll give her this.
She is one cold, nasty piece of work.

935
01:10:33,605 --> 01:10:37,649
-When did she send this to you?
-She didn't tape it. You did.

936
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:41,570
We had a bug in your phone.
We had the whole thing wired.

937
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:45,824
Hey, we had to. New guy on the team?
This late in the game?

938
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:49,745
What can I tell you?
The bitch put me through the wringer.

939
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,414
Look, if I'd have known it was her,
I would never have taken the job.

940
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:56,960
-No, no. You didn't tell us the truth, Ray.
-Are you firing me, Duke?

941
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,046
Why didn't you do it then?
Why not fire me that day?

942
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:01,214
-Why keep me around?
-DUKE: Why?

943
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:09,389
Because you're the biggest swinging dick
I've ever seen.

944
01:11:10,934 --> 01:11:12,309
(BOTH LAUGHING)

945
01:11:16,064 --> 01:11:19,066
Come on! We thought we were losing her.

946
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:22,277
We thought we'd had her out there too long
and she'd gone off the rails.

947
01:11:22,362 --> 01:11:24,112
And that's why we brought you in.

948
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:27,407
But this?
This is more than we ever expected.

949
01:11:27,492 --> 01:11:31,036
When you drop the hammer on her,
when you take her to the bar...

950
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,955
CLAlRE OVER PHONE:
You've 10 seconds to get your hand off me.

951
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:34,498
RAY OVER PHONE:
Or what? You won't be my friend anymore?

952
01:11:34,582 --> 01:11:37,751
No, no, no, no, no.
Do the other one. Do the other one.

953
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:39,753
-Okay. Here.
-Right.

954
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:43,090
RAY: Now, maybe you're so used to having
your Iegs in the air you don't reaIize it,

955
01:11:43,174 --> 01:11:45,300
but you're upside down, sister.

956
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:47,469
I own you.

957
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:50,806
Damn! Man, I wish I had video on this!

958
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:52,683
"I own you."

959
01:11:53,977 --> 01:11:57,312
-Who else knows about this?
-Just me, just me and Dale.

960
01:11:57,397 --> 01:11:59,439
So you were just kidding
about the meet with Garsik, right?

961
01:11:59,524 --> 01:12:01,692
No, no. That's for real.
But don't worry about her.

962
01:12:01,776 --> 01:12:04,569
I mean, obviously, she doesn't need to know
that we know what's going on,

963
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:07,197
so you just keep...
You know, just play it straight.

964
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:08,448
Of course.

965
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:11,535
RAY: l don't know. l mean,
I'm not great on names. I shouId be. I try.

966
01:12:11,619 --> 01:12:14,621
Faces, I'm definiteIy better.
Faces, l'm like a B, B minus.

967
01:12:14,706 --> 01:12:18,542
Where I'm good, where I reaIIy exceI,
peopIe I've sIept with.

968
01:12:18,626 --> 01:12:19,710
(BOTH LAUGHING)

969
01:12:19,794 --> 01:12:21,670
-"I own you."
-"I own you."

970
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:23,797
-"I own you."
-DALE: "I own you."

971
01:12:24,257 --> 01:12:26,258
(BOTH LAUGHING)

972
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:19,895
You should have called.

973
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:23,023
I could have been home hours ago.

974
01:13:27,528 --> 01:13:29,905
-Where's your bag?
-I'm on the red-eye.

975
01:13:29,989 --> 01:13:31,740
-No.
-I'm supposed to be in Houston.

976
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:34,659
I had to blow my connection. It was
the only way I'd steal a couple of hours.

977
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:35,827
You should have paged me.

978
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:39,039
I've been sitting in the office
doing field reports, for Christ's sake.

979
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:40,624
I couldn't risk it.

980
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:43,376
-From a pay phone?
-Not from anywhere.

981
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:46,630
Why? What's going on?

982
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:51,218
-Nigel Bingham.
-Nigel Bingham?

983
01:13:51,302 --> 01:13:54,346
-You were together in Athens.
-He was my station chief.

984
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:57,057
-You still on good terms?
-Great. Why?

985
01:13:57,558 --> 01:13:59,976
Equikrom, the special unit, they're hiring.

986
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:03,522
Duke needs a field agent.
I figured out a way to get you in.

987
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:06,108
It's happening, Ray. It's war.

988
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:09,778
-What do you mean, war?
-I mean like a total corporate death match.

989
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:12,948
We're on. B&R is about to make a move.

990
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:16,409
-What kind of move?
-Some new product. Something big.

991
01:14:16,494 --> 01:14:18,245
What do you mean, "big"?

992
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:22,666
Big, big like we've had four top-down
tech sweeps in the last two weeks.

993
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:27,003
Big like three days ago
we started auditing passwords hourly.

994
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:29,756
This morning I got a message from Duke.

995
01:14:29,841 --> 01:14:32,717
He wants me to go active.
I'm gonna get word to him tomorrow

996
01:14:32,802 --> 01:14:36,638
that unless he gets me a great field officer
to work with he can forget it.

997
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:39,141
You're gonna get that job.

998
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:40,976
Without knowing what the product is?

999
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,395
Well, that's the point. Nobody knows.

1000
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,355
All we have to do is get there first.

1001
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:48,608
You on one side, me on the other.
It's perfect.

1002
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:52,362
What does all this have to do
with Nigel Bingham?

1003
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:55,073
He's Duke's drinking buddy.
They play cards twice a week.

1004
01:14:55,158 --> 01:14:56,199
You call Nigel.

1005
01:14:56,284 --> 01:14:58,368
You're just checking in,
you're stuck in Cleveland,

1006
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:00,579
you're going crazy,
you're calling everybody.

1007
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:03,415
Tell him you're desperate to get to New York.

1008
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:06,209
Aren't you desperate to get to New York?

1009
01:15:06,294 --> 01:15:10,589
-Well, yeah, of course I am, but it's just...
-Just what?

1010
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:13,466
Well, the pizza thing's really heating up.

1011
01:15:13,551 --> 01:15:16,595
We're launching Frozen Hawaiian
next month, pineapple and ham.

1012
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:19,264
First time anyone's ever done that.

1013
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:21,683
Congratulations.

1014
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:23,101
Well, it's not the first first time

1015
01:15:23,186 --> 01:15:26,146
'cause those weasels at Flakey Fresh
stole the idea from Butter Mills,

1016
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:28,023
and then, you'll love this,

1017
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:31,735
we find out that the Vice President of
Marketing has this 22-year-old assistant

1018
01:15:31,819 --> 01:15:36,114
who's $60,000 in debt
to a TV shopping network. Bingo.

1019
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:38,033
Really.

1020
01:15:39,869 --> 01:15:41,453
Are these hers?

1021
01:15:42,747 --> 01:15:43,997
What is that?

1022
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:46,750
It's a thong. It was in your closet.

1023
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:51,379
That's not possible.

1024
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:53,757
Well, whose are they?

1025
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:58,136
-Nobody's because it's impossible.
-Impossible what?

1026
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:02,515
That someone would leave them,
or you'd forget or that I'd find them?

1027
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,518
Impossible because I've been faithful.
Which closet?

1028
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:08,146
-Which closet?
-This is insane.

1029
01:16:08,231 --> 01:16:10,523
-You're denying this?
-Absolutely.

1030
01:16:10,608 --> 01:16:13,276
The only woman who's been in this place
since I moved in is the landlady

1031
01:16:13,361 --> 01:16:15,403
and she couldn't wear that as a wristband.

1032
01:16:15,488 --> 01:16:17,364
So where did they come from?

1033
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:20,242
Look, I swear to you.

1034
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:22,786
Claire, I swear,
I swear on all things good and true,

1035
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:25,705
I have no idea who they belong to.
And the fact that you don't believe me,

1036
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:28,083
the fact that we've been through
everything that we've been through

1037
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:32,754
and that you still don't trust me on this,
is, quite frankly, disturbing.

1038
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:36,508
Well, in that case, I'll put them back on.

1039
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:38,718
They're yours?

1040
01:16:38,803 --> 01:16:40,512
You passed.

1041
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,305
You're gaming me?

1042
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:44,891
I just needed to hear you say it.

1043
01:16:48,646 --> 01:16:51,356
-You're that upset?
-Yeah, I think so.

1044
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:02,117
But kind of turned on, too, right?

1045
01:17:04,203 --> 01:17:08,999
The drag is I've only got 55 minutes
to make it up to you.

1046
01:17:51,042 --> 01:17:52,459
RICHARD: Forget it.

1047
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:57,213
I never liked this game.

1048
01:17:57,298 --> 01:18:01,843
Any sport that puts a limit on your score
is a complete waste of time.

1049
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,846
Three hundred, that's it?

1050
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:08,892
What, are you gonna bust your nut to do
something 9 million other jokers might do?

1051
01:18:08,976 --> 01:18:10,769
Stupidest damn thing I ever heard of.

1052
01:18:10,853 --> 01:18:14,147
Okay, so don't turn around,
but she just came in.

1053
01:18:15,232 --> 01:18:18,234
-We're cool though, right? She see us?
-Oh, yeah.

1054
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:21,029
-I look natural, right?
-Super natural.

1055
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:27,327
Who picked this place?

1056
01:18:27,411 --> 01:18:30,413
-You have a problem?
-It's a little bright.

1057
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:34,376
-So this gentleman here is...
-I know who he is.

1058
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:37,796
You do? Even with the hat?

1059
01:18:38,672 --> 01:18:40,882
She's a trained professional.

1060
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:43,426
Yeah, yeah, I can see that.

1061
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:46,388
I can definitely...

1062
01:18:47,306 --> 01:18:49,641
Would you...
You know what, we got beers here.

1063
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:51,142
-Would you care for something?
-She's fine.

1064
01:18:51,227 --> 01:18:54,396
-I'm starving.
-Well, hell, then we should feed you.

1065
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,606
I'd love some pizza.
Do you think they have pizza?

1066
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:58,400
I'll just bet that they do, yeah.

1067
01:18:58,484 --> 01:19:00,026
-Or even frozen pizza.
-Okay.

1068
01:19:00,111 --> 01:19:02,654
-I don't think so.
-Why don't you go take a look-see?

1069
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:04,197
You'd smell it if they did.

1070
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:08,868
I don't give a damn if you have to go
to Sicily, get the lady some pizza!

1071
01:19:11,872 --> 01:19:13,790
Any particular topping you'd like?

1072
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:15,333
Surprise me.

1073
01:19:20,256 --> 01:19:21,423
BOY: Pepperoni.

1074
01:19:22,633 --> 01:19:24,884
Super Cheese-a-peno.

1075
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:27,345
Mushroom.

1076
01:19:28,139 --> 01:19:29,931
Mushroom and onion.

1077
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:33,101
Plain.

1078
01:19:33,811 --> 01:19:35,770
-Hawaiian.
-Plain.

1079
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:43,736
-Do you like it hot or...
-Yeah, hot. Very hot.

1080
01:19:44,822 --> 01:19:46,364
Extremely hot.

1081
01:19:50,578 --> 01:19:52,495
You want something to drink?

1082
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:54,622
Yeah, sure, whatever.

1083
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,632
What's going on? What just happened?

1084
01:20:05,092 --> 01:20:06,551
You...

1085
01:20:07,261 --> 01:20:09,095
You gotta get Duke. You gotta get Duke.

1086
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:12,640
And you've gotta tell him
to get me a secure line

1087
01:20:12,725 --> 01:20:14,142
because he's gotta call me right away.

1088
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:16,728
-What did she say?
-Secure line.

1089
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:19,439
Do you understand me?
And only if he is sure.

1090
01:20:19,523 --> 01:20:21,983
I gotta get on the plane,
and he's gotta call me,

1091
01:20:22,067 --> 01:20:24,486
but it has gotta be safe.

1092
01:20:39,752 --> 01:20:42,629
Yeah, it's me. I need Duke. Now.

1093
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:46,883
Yeah. Well, tell him to hurry up.

1094
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:12,677
What are you doing?

1095
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:14,512
Me?

1096
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:17,307
-How did you get here so fast?
-Not fast enough though, right?

1097
01:22:17,391 --> 01:22:19,475
-You're leaving?
-I didn't think you were coming.

1098
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:20,768
I left the signal, didn't I?

1099
01:22:20,853 --> 01:22:22,979
You also took your passports
and the travel money.

1100
01:22:23,063 --> 01:22:24,981
Half the money. My half.

1101
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:28,443
We took a vow. No one touches
the mayday pouch until it's time to bail.

1102
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:29,611
I trusted you.

1103
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:32,405
Which explains
why you were in there checking it.

1104
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:34,073
-When did you do this?
-When?

1105
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:39,037
About five or six hours after I got done
with Barbara Bofferd from B&R Travel.

1106
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:41,414
You're kidding.

1107
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:44,959
-That's what this is about?
-That?

1108
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:47,920
We're in play, for Christ's sake.
We don't have time for this.

1109
01:22:48,005 --> 01:22:50,298
Why? Is it a long explanation?

1110
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:52,342
Walk.

1111
01:22:52,843 --> 01:22:54,385
What the hell did you just tell Garsik?

1112
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:56,179
-You're unbelievable.
-What's the secret?

1113
01:22:56,263 --> 01:22:58,765
-You screwed her!
-Yeah. For us. For the project.

1114
01:22:58,849 --> 01:23:02,018
-I can't believe you screwed her!
-It was an assignment. It was nothing.

1115
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:03,436
Well, you should see the pictures.

1116
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,355
Well, you're the last person
I need to explain this to.

1117
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:07,065
The only difference
between this and our first date

1118
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:09,359
is that no one was drugged into a coma
and left for dead.

1119
01:23:09,443 --> 01:23:12,153
Left for dead? You were asleep in bed
with a smile on your face!

1120
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:14,322
-Yeah, for 1 8 bloody hours!
-See, there it is.

1121
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:16,574
-You can't get past Dubai, can you?
-What's the product, Claire?

1122
01:23:16,659 --> 01:23:18,618
-You say that you can, but you can't.
-What is the product?

1123
01:23:18,702 --> 01:23:22,163
All right, you know what,
I did come back here to clear out my stuff.

1124
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:24,499
All right, I was gone. I was ready to bail.

1125
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:27,168
I got the pouch out, I'm halfway there,
and I suddenly realize,

1126
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:31,506
"Oh, my God! What are you doing?
This is good. This could work. It's payback.

1127
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:35,176
"We take Dubai, the travel tramp, call it even,
move on, never mention it again."

1128
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:36,844
So, there I am, I'm loading it all back in,

1129
01:23:36,929 --> 01:23:38,388
I'm putting everything away,
like it never happened,

1130
01:23:38,472 --> 01:23:41,933
and I suddenly realize
there's something missing.

1131
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:44,352
-Where's Ray's Canadian passport?
-Okay, slow down.

1132
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:46,354
Which I know for a fact
is supposed to be in there

1133
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:48,690
because I'm the one
who taped the whole thing together!

1134
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:51,109
Yes, okay?
Yes, I took the Canadian passport.

1135
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:53,486
One passport. Why?
Because I was paranoid.

1136
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:55,822
All this probing and testing
and not trusting me, it gets to you.

1137
01:23:55,906 --> 01:23:57,824
I thought, what's the harm
in having one little parachute

1138
01:23:57,908 --> 01:23:59,075
in case the plane goes down?

1139
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:01,661
I wanted a hole card. That's it.
That's all it was.

1140
01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:05,498
And the travel lady, did I have to go
that far? Maybe not. But it worked.

1141
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:09,043
And you know what, that's my cover.
That's always been my cover.

1142
01:24:09,128 --> 01:24:12,714
I'm a mess. I'm a horndog. I'm a slob.
But that's my edge.

1143
01:24:12,798 --> 01:24:14,424
I mean, we're here trying to run a triple game

1144
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:16,968
on some very smart
and very motivated players.

1145
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:19,303
What do you want me to do,
play with one hand behind my back?

1146
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:22,056
It wasn't your hand I was talking about.

1147
01:24:22,141 --> 01:24:24,434
You know what? Get over it.

1148
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:26,894
You know what? I'm there.

1149
01:24:29,231 --> 01:24:30,398
So what are you saying?

1150
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:33,568
Same split, new rules.
You keep your parachute. I'll keep mine.

1151
01:24:33,652 --> 01:24:35,820
-You're that jealous?
-No, I'm that focused.

1152
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:37,655
I've got two years invested in this,

1153
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:41,576
and the last thing I'm gonna do is let some
stupid, immature personal baggage

1154
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:44,162
compromise an otherwise
successful operation.

1155
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:46,247
-So we're strictly business now.
-Deal with it.

1156
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:48,916
Well, it might help if I knew
what kind of business we were in.

1157
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:51,878
Hair. They can grow hair.

1158
01:24:52,379 --> 01:24:54,088
Where it belongs.

1159
01:24:55,215 --> 01:24:56,340
You mean what? Like...

1160
01:24:56,425 --> 01:25:00,344
Like, from now on, Ronnie Partiz
will be the patron saint to all bald men.

1161
01:25:00,429 --> 01:25:03,806
-Except there won't be any bald men.
-A cure for baldness?

1162
01:25:03,891 --> 01:25:09,312
Burkett & Randle Wash and Grow Shampoo,
enriched with activated Partizonol.

1163
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:14,066
-Hair? That's like...
-It's huge.

1164
01:25:14,735 --> 01:25:18,154
Huge? It's beyond huge.
It makes huge look bloody microscopic.

1165
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:21,991
Do you have any idea what this is worth?
I mean, hair.

1166
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:27,121
To grow hair, to own that,
that's the all-time Holy Grail.

1167
01:25:27,206 --> 01:25:29,415
No wonder they've been so crazy.

1168
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:32,084
I mean, we're sitting here
on a cure for baldness

1169
01:25:32,169 --> 01:25:34,879
and you're getting worked up
about some meaningless incident.

1170
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:39,217
-We don't have it.
-We don't? But it's a formula though, right?

1171
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:43,221
It has to be. It has to be a formula
with a patent application.

1172
01:25:43,305 --> 01:25:45,848
-So who's got it? Where is it?
-I don't know.

1173
01:25:45,933 --> 01:25:47,642
If you did,
you'd be sharing that, though, right?

1174
01:25:47,726 --> 01:25:51,020
If I were holding out on you,
what would I be doing here now?

1175
01:25:51,104 --> 01:25:52,772
How about pretending
to be pissed off and jealous

1176
01:25:52,898 --> 01:25:54,649
just to keep me from thinking
what was really going on.

1177
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:56,067
That's sick, even for you.

1178
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:58,069
Yeah, and that's not the answer
I was looking for.

1179
01:25:58,153 --> 01:25:59,487

Hello.

01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:04,408
Claire? It's Ned.

1183
01:26:04,952 --> 01:26:08,746
I need you back at the office.
Now. Like immediately.

1184

I'll be downstairs in 1 0 minutes.

1185
01:26:14,753 --> 01:26:17,088
I have to go. That was Guston.
I have to get back to the office.

1186
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,257
We don't have any partners
I don't know about, do we?

1187
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:21,509
Yeah, that's what I want. More partners.

1188
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:24,262
It would be so stupid to burn me now.

1189
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:27,265
I have to go.

1190
01:26:28,475 --> 01:26:30,810
-We're not gonna talk about this?
-You said it. We're in play.

1191
01:26:30,936 --> 01:26:33,604
-We don't have time.
-Claire...

1192
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:47,743
PHYSEC 1 : We had a motion detector
go off on 31 , near Mr. Tully's office.

1193
01:26:47,828 --> 01:26:49,453
There's some document rooms up there.

1194
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:51,414
We found one of the security cages
wide open,

1195
01:26:51,498 --> 01:26:53,124
and we started turning on the lights.

1196
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:55,334
We heard some scurrying around,
had a little foot race.

1197
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:57,044
It took a couple minutes,
but we found him down here

1198
01:26:57,129 --> 01:26:58,504
-hiding under the desk.
-Jesus.

1199
01:26:58,630 --> 01:26:59,714
-PHYSEC 1 : We get to running his ID...
-Ned!

1200
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:02,216
...he starts trying to tell us the whole thing
was some kind of security test.

1201
01:27:02,301 --> 01:27:03,718
Hey, Ned, get these things off me!

1202
01:27:03,802 --> 01:27:06,721
We said, "Hey, that's great,
but we still gotta call your boss."

1203
01:27:06,805 --> 01:27:08,431
That's when he started sweating.

1204
01:27:08,515 --> 01:27:10,808
-Where's the thing?
-PHYSEC 2: Yeah, he had this.

1205
01:27:10,893 --> 01:27:14,645
-"Partizonol 6. 1 ."
-JEFF: Ned, I can explain this!

1206
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:18,065
NED: Shut up, Jeff. Did you open this?
PHYSEC 1 : No.

1207
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:21,110
-Did anybody else touch this?
-No, sir, just us and the suspect.

1208
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:25,823
Suspect? Well, that's no suspect.
You're not a suspect, are you, Jeff?

1209
01:27:25,908 --> 01:27:28,910
You're a backstabbing little weasel,
and you're gonna burn, asshole.

1210
01:27:28,994 --> 01:27:30,786
Okay. Okay, I want a lawyer!

1211
01:27:30,871 --> 01:27:32,872
Forget the lawyer, weasel.
What you need is a net

1212
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:35,666
'cause I'm gonna throw
your backstabbing ass out the window!

1213
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:37,335
Is the area upstairs secure now?

1214
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:39,170
Yeah, are you sure
there's no one else upstairs?

1215
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:41,213
It's gotta be cleared out before it's re-armed.

1216
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:44,926
-How long does that take?
-All three floors? 20 minutes.

Hey, get back here!

1221
01:27:57,689 --> 01:28:01,108
Don't leave me here with him!
You heard what he said!

1222
01:28:01,193 --> 01:28:04,111
Hey, I mean it! Ned, come on. Claire!

1223
01:28:08,784 --> 01:28:10,660
Okay, you stay here with Jeff.

1224
01:28:10,744 --> 01:28:12,787
I'm gonna run downstairs
and toss his office.

1225
01:28:12,871 --> 01:28:14,830
-You don't wanna call it in?
-No.

1226
01:28:14,915 --> 01:28:18,918
All right, we gotta take the lead
so no one else gets involved.

1227
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:20,878
What about that?

1228
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:26,926
Leave it. Don't move it. Don't touch it.
Just leave it. All right?

1229
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:30,721
And relax, okay. I'm gonna call it in.

his original state, his virility.

-Don't laugh. Excuse me.
-Duke, I think you really...

I think you need to relax.

-Hey, Ray, so where the hell you been?

-No, I'm good.

-All right.
-Cool.

1242
01:29:05,465 --> 01:29:07,591
So what is it, guys?

01:29:07,968 --> 01:29:10,344
-What's the secret?
-The secret?

1244
01:29:12,681 --> 01:29:13,931
Hair.

1245
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:22,773
All right, listen to me, Claire. Forget Ned.
Okay? Forget Tully.

Do you have any idea what this is worth?
They can grow hair!

1247
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:29,030
Okay? They can restore hair.

1248
01:29:29,114 --> 01:29:31,365
Do you have any idea
what we could sell this for?

It's an open technology.

1251

Now, there it is. I can see it. It's a fortune.
It's just... All right.

1252
01:29:40,042 --> 01:29:44,295
Claire! All right, just wait. Wait.
Claire, listen. Listen to me.

You know that!

Beside the name.
Match the name to the numbers.

-Is it going to work?
-Get the phone out of here, Ray!

would it make any difference?

1613
01:55:10,988 --> 01:55:14,865
we've logged
about 200 false-flag travel orders.

1614
01:55:15,325 --> 01:55:18,452
Formavale? Damned if l know.
Some kind of biotech.

1615
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:23,833
PAM: Cars, planes, hotels, everything.
Then we buried them in the actual files.

1616
01:55:24,167 --> 01:55:27,044
-And when they start digging?
-They find Ronnie.

1617
01:55:27,129 --> 01:55:29,714
Yes. And there's a plane waiting
to take me back to the Bahamas

1618
01:55:29,798 --> 01:55:30,965
once we're done here tonight.

1619
01:55:33,260 --> 01:55:34,302
(SIGHS)

1620
01:55:34,386 --> 01:55:36,304
RONNIE: This is my high school yearbook.

1621
01:55:37,180 --> 01:55:38,973
And the transcripts.

1622
01:55:39,057 --> 01:55:40,558
RlCHARD: You gotta stop waltzing around,

1623
01:55:40,642 --> 01:55:42,768
and you have got to get on this guy.

1624
01:55:42,853 --> 01:55:45,605
So we take Ronnie's reality
until two years ago

1625
01:55:45,689 --> 01:55:47,231
and we lay in our story on top.

1626
01:55:47,316 --> 01:55:48,482
PHYSEC 1 : We started turning on the lights.

1627
01:55:48,567 --> 01:55:50,735
We heard some scurrying around,
we had a little foot race.

1628
01:55:50,819 --> 01:55:52,486
It took a coupIe of minutes,
but we found him down here

1629
01:55:52,571 --> 01:55:53,613
hiding under the desk.

1630
01:55:53,947 --> 01:55:55,031
The trips to Dunwoody,

1631
01:55:55,115 --> 01:55:57,617
the background
on the Formavale acquisitions,

1632
01:55:57,701 --> 01:56:01,287
the midnight load-outs,
it's all in place and ready to go.

1633
01:56:02,789 --> 01:56:06,334
Great work. Inspiring. Incredible.

1634
01:56:08,337 --> 01:56:11,172
This is more fun than if we really had it.

1635
01:56:11,590 --> 01:56:14,300
Ten days, that's the deadline.

1636
01:56:14,384 --> 01:56:17,345
Garsik has his shareholder meeting
in 1 0 days.

1637
01:56:18,347 --> 01:56:21,057
Light the fuse. Put it in play.

1638
01:56:28,482 --> 01:56:31,192
CLAIRE: Don't.
RAY: Don't what?

1639
01:56:31,777 --> 01:56:34,695
CLAIRE: Don't say it.
RAY: Say what?

1640
01:56:35,364 --> 01:56:37,573
CLAIRE: I know what you're thinking.

1641
01:56:37,658 --> 01:56:40,701
You're wondering
if I gave you a bogus formula.

1642
01:56:41,203 --> 01:56:45,331
You're thinking maybe I've got the real one
stashed someplace else.

1643
01:56:45,415 --> 01:56:48,125
That's sick, even for you.

1644
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:50,961
But it crossed your mind.

1645
01:56:51,546 --> 01:56:55,549
-That's why I get the big bucks.
-Because I would never do that.

1646
01:56:56,968 --> 01:57:00,554
-Because you love me.
-Exactly.

1647
01:57:06,603 --> 01:57:10,314
Mr. Koval and Miss Stenwick?

1648
01:57:22,452 --> 01:57:30,501
Read it.

1649
01:57:31,795 --> 01:57:34,004
RAY: "Compliments of Howard Tully."

1650
01:58:16,047 --> 01:58:20,634
-We got totally played, didn't we?
-Yep.

1651
01:58:22,429 --> 01:58:25,097
Must go pretty far back.

1652
01:58:26,725 --> 01:58:28,434
-Like...
-Way back.

1653
01:58:32,272 --> 01:58:34,815
I guess on a strictly professional level, it's...

1654
01:58:34,900 --> 01:58:36,275
Impressive.

1655
01:58:36,985 --> 01:58:38,611
-I mean...
-Yeah.

1656
01:58:49,414 --> 01:58:51,540
At least we have each other.

1657
01:58:52,209 --> 01:58:55,878
-It really is that bad, isn't it?
-Kind of, yeah.

1658
01:58:56,254 --> 01:58:58,297
-I didn't mean...
-I know.

1659
01:59:02,344 --> 01:59:05,513
-I can't breathe.
-You'll be okay.

1660
01:59:06,473 --> 01:59:10,518
-When?
-After we wake up in Rome.

1661
01:59:13,063 --> 01:59:17,316
CLAIRE: I might have to wake up in Rome
for a long time.

1662
01:59:19,569 --> 01:59:21,278
RAY: Sounds like a plan.

1663
01:59:39,756 --> 01:59:43,425
-CROWD: Dick! Dick! Dick! Dick!
-Dick! Dick! Dick! Dick!

1664
01:59:44,177 --> 01:59:48,430
-Dick! Dick! Dick! Dick!
-Dick! Dick! Dick! Dick!

1665
01:59:51,226 --> 01:59:54,728
I won't begin to understand

1666
01:59:54,813 --> 01:59:58,232
How I just found the perfect man

1667
01:59:58,316 --> 02:00:00,985
Where have you been hiding out?

1668
02:00:01,069 --> 02:00:03,320
You're deadIy

1669
02:00:05,574 --> 02:00:08,909
You turn me on
You spun me out

1670
02:00:08,994 --> 02:00:12,913
You know just what I'm aII about

1671
02:00:12,998 --> 02:00:17,376
I've got my eyes aII over you
You're tricky

1672
02:00:19,671 --> 02:00:22,756
Now l see

1673
02:00:22,841 --> 02:00:29,763
How life could be
A scent so sweet

1674
02:00:30,265 --> 02:00:34,268
You've got me faIIing

1675
02:00:34,352 --> 02:00:41,150
Being bad never feIt so good

1676
02:00:41,234 --> 02:00:45,946
Being bad never feIt so good, my dear

1677

A perfect match
A naughty game

1681
02:01:06,134 --> 02:01:10,137
Please, l never want
to be the same

1682
02:01:10,221 --> 02:01:17,061
A perfect sin you've got me in
