Sarah, I... love you.

33
00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:26,233
Think about the fact that we've been together now for almost a year...

34
00:02:26,276 --> 00:02:29,105
and we still haven't really discussed our future.

35
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,238
I love you.I love you too.

36
00:02:33,022 --> 00:02:35,633
That'll be my date.

37
00:02:35,677 --> 00:02:39,420
I really hate this.I know.

38
00:02:39,463 --> 00:02:42,510
I'm sorry.
It's just for tonight.

39
00:02:42,553 --> 00:02:45,600
I've gotta finish
getting dressed.

40
00:02:45,643 --> 00:02:48,211
Do you mind
getting that for me?

41
00:02:48,255 --> 00:02:50,257
I hate this a lot.

42
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,963
H-Hi. Is
Miss Sarah Goldman--

43
00:03:01,006 --> 00:03:03,313
Yeah, come on in.Thank you.

44
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,801
I'm Robert Schroeder.Chris Kringle.

45
00:03:14,716 --> 00:03:16,631
I'm sorry?

46
00:03:16,674 --> 00:03:18,981
Yeah, it's like
Santa Claus.

47
00:03:19,024 --> 00:03:21,070
Gonna know whether
I'm naughty or nice?

48
00:03:22,724 --> 00:03:24,465
Yes, I will.

49
00:03:29,557 --> 00:03:31,254
Is Miss Gold--She's getting dressed.

50
00:03:31,298 --> 00:03:33,387
Thank you.

51
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,433
Is this even legal
what you do? Absolutely.

52
00:03:36,477 --> 00:03:39,306
We're licensed by the state.
This isn't like picking up
a phone book...

53
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:41,308
and dialing a 24-hour service.

54
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:44,528
No, no, no, no, no.
Most of our clientele
are elderly women...

55
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:47,618
who just want a hand to hold
on to when they go to the opera
or the ballet or something.

56
00:03:47,662 --> 00:03:49,707
In fact, I went to
the opera last night.

57
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:52,188
Tristan und Isolde.
It was great!

58
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,104
Have you seen it?No, I can't say
that I have.

59
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:58,499
Well, it was great.

60
00:04:00,588 --> 00:04:02,198
It was long,

61
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,244
but great.

62
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:10,075
You do this a lot?

63
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:14,384
Well, let's see.
Counting last night,
this would be my second job.

64
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:18,301
The only requirements are:
"Do you speak good English?"
And "Do you own a tux?"

65
00:04:18,345 --> 00:04:20,477
Beats waiting tables.

66
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,395
- So you're an actor.
- Yes! Yes.

67
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,397
I'm an actor, yes.Okay.

68
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:32,576
- What do you do?
- I'm in advertising.

69
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,449
Do you write copy?

70
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:39,061
No. I'm an account
supervisor.

71
00:04:39,104 --> 00:04:41,629
Well, great.

72
00:04:43,544 --> 00:04:45,502
Hi. Sorry to keep
you waiting.

73
00:04:45,546 --> 00:04:48,766
Hi. I'm Sarah.

74
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,421
I'm Bob.I'm outta here.

75
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:53,902
I'll call you later.

76
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:55,904
You sure you wanna
do this?

77
00:04:55,947 --> 00:04:58,167
I'll call you as soon
as the coast is clear.

78
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,213
You sure you don't
want me to--No.

79
00:05:01,257 --> 00:05:05,305
I love you.I know.

80
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:08,003
I really hate this.I'm sorry.
I'll talk to you later.

81
00:05:08,046 --> 00:05:11,136
All right, I'm going.
Good-bye.It was nice meeting you.

82
00:05:13,182 --> 00:05:15,924
Bye. Bye.

83
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:21,364
So, hi.Hi. You have
a wonderful apartment here.

84
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:24,149
Thanks. We have to go.Okay.

85
00:05:24,193 --> 00:05:26,238
Where we going?My parents' house.

86
00:05:26,282 --> 00:05:28,632
- What's the occasion?
- It's my father's birthday.

87
00:05:28,676 --> 00:05:32,157
Geez. I wish I would
have known. I would have brought
him a present or something.

88
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:35,639
- I got him something
from both of us.
- Okay.

89
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:40,514
I'm just really behind
schedule, so let's go.

90
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:44,953
Sorry.

91
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,658
Can I ask you
a question?Sure. What?

92
00:05:54,702 --> 00:05:58,358
Well, I was just wondering, why
did you hire an escort service?
You and Chris seem pretty--

93
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:01,839
We are.
We are, basically.
But, um--

94
00:06:01,883 --> 00:06:04,407
Well, my family doesn't
know about it. I mean,
they did at first,

95
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:07,236
but my parents
were so unhappy
about it, it just--

96
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:09,412
Why? He seems like
a nice guy.He is! He is!

97
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:12,415
But, 
he isn't Jewish.

98
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:18,595
Hop in.Would you like me to drive?
You seem a little--

99
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,902
No, thank you.
I'm fine.

100
00:06:22,338 --> 00:06:24,949
Wait a second.

101
00:06:26,864 --> 00:06:29,171
So, what, are your parents,
like, Orthodox?No.

102
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:32,304
No. They just--
They want what's best
for their children,

103
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:36,483
which translated means I should
only date someone Jewish.

104
00:06:36,526 --> 00:06:39,486
Which, you know, Chris
obviously is not. So--

105
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:46,144
We've been seeing
each other on the sly
for the past six months.

106
00:06:46,188 --> 00:06:48,451
Wow.I know.

107
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,370
Sure you don't want me
to drive?No, no, no, no, no.

108
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,372
I'm fine.

109
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,527
I really don't mind driving.That's okay. I just have to
pick up a bottle of wine.

110
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:26,576
This whole thing
is so stupid,
but my parents--

111
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,231
Well, you know.
They're my parents.

112
00:07:29,274 --> 00:07:31,712
My father--
He was sick last year.

113
00:07:31,755 --> 00:07:35,455
My mother has been so tense.
I just-- I can't give them
any grief right now.

114
00:07:35,498 --> 00:07:39,110
The worst of it
was after I told them that
I'd stopped seeing Chris,

115
00:07:39,154 --> 00:07:41,722
they assumed I wasn't seeing
anybody, so my mother kept
trying to fix me up...

116
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:45,160
with all these sons
of friends and relatives--

117
00:07:45,203 --> 00:07:47,641
and I don't know--
strangers she'd meet
on the street.

118
00:07:47,684 --> 00:07:50,905
I don't know where she found
these guys, but my mother is
determined to make me happy...

119
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:53,168
whether I like it or not.

120
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:57,215
So, anyway, a few months ago,
just so they'd feel better,
I told them--

121
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:59,217
I said, "I've started
seeing someone."

122
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:02,525
I just invented
a boyfriend.

123
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:05,876
And that's--

124
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,965
Yeah, right.

125
00:08:10,228 --> 00:08:11,795
Wow.

126
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:18,933
I thought about asking
a friend of mine to be my
stand-in beau for the evening,

127
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:21,544
but frankly, I'm too embarrassed
for anyone I know
to know about it.

128
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:25,548
So, I called your agency.

129
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:29,073
You must think this is
extremely weird.

130
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:34,470
Well, I must admit, I expected
you to be a little old lady
who needed a dinner companion.

131
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,646
But this would have been
my second guess.

132
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,431
Let's go.I really don't mind
driving.

133
00:08:47,962 --> 00:08:51,139
La--

134
00:08:51,182 --> 00:08:53,707
Listen, 
my father's name is Abe.

135
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,318
He owns a couple
of men's clothing stores.

136
00:08:56,361 --> 00:08:59,974
My mother's name is Miriam.
But I think you should just
call them Mr. and Mrs. Goldman.

137
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:02,585
My brother
will be there too.
He's a psychologist.

138
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:06,371
He has two children.
He's divorced. -

139
00:09:06,415 --> 00:09:09,549
You and I have been dating
since January. We met at
the wedding of my best friend--

140
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:11,420
Marilyn Dittenfass.

141
00:09:11,463 --> 00:09:14,249
You think you can
remember that?

142
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:15,990
Y-Yeah, I guess.

143
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:18,645
Only-- Wow.

144
00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:21,517
Um--What?

145
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,998
Well, you know,
I think I can handle it.

146
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:28,002
It's just,
I was thinking, you know,
with your parents and all,

147
00:09:28,045 --> 00:09:31,919
maybe it'd be better
if you hired somebody
that... is Jewish.

148
00:09:31,962 --> 00:09:33,921
You're Jewish.

149
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:36,227
No, I'm not.

150
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:39,666
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Your last name's Schroeder.
That's a Jewish name.

151
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:42,669
Not to me.
My father's Polish
and my mother's Italian.

152
00:09:42,712 --> 00:09:47,064
No, no. I'm sorry.
I specifically asked
the agency...

153
00:09:47,108 --> 00:09:49,153
for somebody Jewish.

154
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:51,286
Well, maybe
they thought Schroeder
was a Jewish name too.

155
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:53,331
Honest mistake.

156
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:57,945
No!
I'm gonna die!

157
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,253
No!
I'm gonna die!

158
00:10:02,297 --> 00:10:04,995
Maybe we could call
the agency, see if they could
find somebody else.

159
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,346
No, no.
No, there's no time.
We have to get in there!

160
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:13,482
No, I'm gonna die.Look, it's gonna be
all right.

161
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:17,007
No, no, I'm gonna die.
They'll find the body.
You explain it.

162
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:20,532
No, no, Sarah, listen.
I'm a good actor. I was gonna
have to do some acting anyway.

163
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:24,449
- No. They-They'll know.
- No, no, they won't. Look.

164
00:10:24,493 --> 00:10:28,628
I once did a six-month tour of Fiddler on the Roof.
Theodore
Bikel thought I was Jewish.

165
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:30,804
No, no! They'll know.
They'll know.

166
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:32,806
No, they won't know.They'll know.

167
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:35,199
They can spot a Jew
a mile away.
It's like radar.

168
00:10:35,243 --> 00:10:37,680
Sarah, take a breath.

169
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:39,551
Come on.

170
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:42,250
Deep breath in.

171
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:45,253
And let it out.

172
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:48,343
One more time.
Cleansing breath in.

173
00:10:48,386 --> 00:10:51,041
And let it out.

174
00:10:53,391 --> 00:10:55,393
Okay, okay.

175
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:07,579
Let's do it.

176
00:11:09,756 --> 00:11:12,410
Okay.All right.

177
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:14,456
Okay.Get in there.

178
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:18,939
We need--

179
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,823
Mom? Dad? We're here.

180
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:35,346
Hello.

181
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:39,873
Your name is
David Steinberg.

182
00:11:45,182 --> 00:11:47,532
Hi, Daddy.Hello, baby.

183
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,799
This is?What?

184
00:11:52,842 --> 00:11:55,410
Him?

00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:59,327
Daddy,

186
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,677

188
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:08,553

00:12:10,642 --> 00:12:13,384
Hi.Hi.

190
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:16,997
Joel, this is David.
David, Joel.

191
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,086
Let me take your coats.Sure.

192
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:26,484
Come on in. Sit down.

193
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:28,748
It's nice to meet you.

194
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:32,795
Nice to meet you
too, Doctor,Thank you.

195
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:35,755
Doctor?I forgot
to tell you.

196
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:44,154
Sit down.

197
00:12:47,157 --> 00:12:49,159
Sit down.

198
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:04,044
Well--Well--

199
00:13:04,087 --> 00:13:06,786
I've heard a lot about you.I've heard a lot
about you too, Doctor.

200
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:09,832
Well, please,
call me, David.

201
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:13,053
David.So how are
your children?

202
00:13:13,096 --> 00:13:15,795
They're fine. Thank you.

203
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:20,321
You know, I don't get to see
them as much as I'd like to.

204
00:13:20,364 --> 00:13:22,279
It's a boy and girl,
right?

205
00:13:22,323 --> 00:13:25,065
Two boys? Two girls? Two boys.

206
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:27,154
Two boys.Two boys. Right.

207
00:13:27,197 --> 00:13:29,852
And their names are?Daniel and Benjamin.

208
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:32,420
Daniel and Benjamin.
Right.

209
00:13:32,463 --> 00:13:35,684
Sarah talks about them
all the time.She does?

210
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:39,688
- So, where's Mom?
- Where's Mom?

211
00:13:39,731 --> 00:13:42,473
She's in the kitchen. She's in the kitchen.

212
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:44,649
She's been in there
for days.

213
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:47,000
I'll go get her.

214
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:51,656
Did you hear about Dad?No. What?

215
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,398
He's closing
the South Side store.Why?

216
00:13:54,442 --> 00:13:56,487
He got held up again.

217
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:59,273
What happened?Is he all right?

218
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:04,191
He's fine. But with the increase
in insurance premiums,
it's just not worth it anymore.

219
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:07,455
Did they catch the guy?They did. Turns out
he was out on parole.

220
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:09,370
He's gonna be serving
some serious time.

221
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:12,503
And Dad's all right?Dad is Dad.

222
00:14:12,547 --> 00:14:16,333
I wish they would
tell me these things.

223
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:18,683
Well--
You got him a present.

224
00:14:20,816 --> 00:14:24,907
A tie.A tie. You know,
we shopped and shopped.

225
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:27,518
And that's the best
you could come up with,
was a tie?

226
00:14:27,562 --> 00:14:29,303
What did you get him?

227
00:14:29,346 --> 00:14:31,696
I gave it a lot of thought.

228
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:35,135
And you got him?

229
00:14:35,178 --> 00:14:37,180
A tie.

230
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:42,142
Hello! I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

231
00:14:42,185 --> 00:14:43,926
Hi, Mom.Hi, honey.

232
00:14:45,493 --> 00:14:47,843
So, where is he?

233
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,976
Hi, Mrs. Goldman.
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

234
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:52,892
My goodness.

235
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:55,633
So handsome!

236
00:14:55,677 --> 00:14:57,984
Well, what are you,
Sephardic?

237
00:14:58,027 --> 00:15:00,160
No, no. I'm Jewish.

238
00:15:00,203 --> 00:15:04,164
I know what you mean.

239
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:06,775
So, why doesn't
everyone sit down.

240
00:15:06,818 --> 00:15:08,908
Let's sit.

241
00:15:10,822 --> 00:15:12,781
Sit down.Thank you, sweetheart.

242
00:15:12,824 --> 00:15:15,610
Listen to how
he calls her "sweetheart."

243
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:18,613
Well, you know, ever since
we met at Madeline's wedding--Marilyn.

244
00:15:18,656 --> 00:15:22,965
Marilyn's wedding. I have felt
like the luckiest man alive.

245
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:27,709
David, sweetheart,
let's not go overboard.

246
00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:31,974
Sarah, tonight I made you
all your favorite foods.

247
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:35,021
You know, I even got you
a challah from
Katzman's Deli.

248
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:37,632
Katzman's is still surviving?They'll be there
forever.

249
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:40,156
What happened to Katzman's?You know Katzman's?

250
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,334
Well, it's a long time ago,
but they had this thing
with the--

251
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:46,423
with the salmonella.

252
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:49,557
Right. Yeah, yeah.
How could I forget?

253
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,820
So, you, you're a doctor?

254
00:15:51,863 --> 00:15:55,955
You know about these things.
What causes that--
that salmonella?

255
00:15:57,869 --> 00:16:03,310
Well, um,
that's very interesting
actually.

256
00:16:03,353 --> 00:16:05,312
A lot of people
don't know this,

257
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:10,839
but salmonella is caused
by a rare bacteria
that gets in the, um, salmon.

258
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,327
Sarah, your father made sure
I made my special
luchen kugel for you.

259
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,198
Right.

260
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:24,200
Happy birthday,
Mr. Goldman.

261
00:16:24,244 --> 00:16:26,768
No. Pooh!

262
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:30,293
This special occasion
is meeting you, David.

263
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:34,950
David, do you like
luchen kugel?

264
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,518
Every chance I get.

265
00:16:37,561 --> 00:16:42,044
Because you've never
tasted luchen kugel
like my luchen kugel.

266
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:44,916
I'm sure of that.

267
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,050
- Well, are we gonna talk about
it, or are we gonna eat it?
- Let's eat.

268
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:49,921
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

269
00:16:49,965 --> 00:16:52,272
Let's eat.

270
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:55,797
Joel.
You're in for it.

271
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,714
What, you couldn't
bring the boys?It's not my weekend, Ma.

272
00:16:59,757 --> 00:17:02,847
For a special occasion,
you could bring the boys.

273
00:17:02,891 --> 00:17:06,242
It's not my weekend.Yeah, I hope you'll
bring them to my funeral.

274
00:17:06,286 --> 00:17:09,202
God willing, it should be
on your weekend.

275
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:11,334
Yeah, if we're lucky.

276
00:17:11,378 --> 00:17:13,771
I know.

277
00:17:13,815 --> 00:17:16,078
Joel, you wanna
open the wine?I'll do it.

278
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:18,080
No, no,
Joel will do it.I don't mind.

279
00:17:18,124 --> 00:17:19,734
Joel will do it.Joel will do it.

280
00:17:19,777 --> 00:17:23,042
You have to save
your beautiful hands
for surgery.

281
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:26,610
Surgery?
I'm a surgeon,
aren't I?

282
00:17:26,654 --> 00:17:29,309
Well, you never know
when you're gonna have
to operate?

283
00:17:29,352 --> 00:17:32,616
Do you wanna light
the Shabbes candles?Yes, let's light the candles.

284
00:17:34,357 --> 00:17:37,447
So, David,
you're at what hospital?

285
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:40,276
Didn't you
tell them, sweetheart?

286
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,063
Yes, I did, sweetheart.
I told you, Mother. David's
at Northwestern Memorial.

287
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:50,591
Do you know Dr. Frankel?
My friend went to him
for her hypertension.

288
00:17:50,634 --> 00:17:52,854
Dr. Frankel?Yeah.

289
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:57,163
- Dr. Frankel?
He's an older man, yes?
- Yeah.

290
00:17:57,206 --> 00:18:00,731
Yeah, if you're tense,
especially if you're
hypertense,

291
00:18:00,775 --> 00:18:03,386
then there's no one better
than Dr. Frankel.

292
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,432
I know.

293
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:09,479
Shall we?

294
00:18:27,802 --> 00:18:31,806
- Amein.
- Joel, please say the hamotzi.

295
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:54,568
Amein.

296
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:00,965
David, would you like
to say the Baruch
over the wine?

297
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:03,968
No! David
doesn't wanna do it.

298
00:19:05,492 --> 00:19:07,146
You-- You do it,
Daddy.

299
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:10,323
You know, I don't mind.
It would be my pleasure.

300
00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:18,983
- Amein.

00:19:22,378 --> 00:19:24,380
♪ To life, to life

302
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,865
Let's eat.

303
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:40,788
David, we'd love to hear
more about your work.

304
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:43,965
Mother, that's enough already.No, that's all right.
I don't mind.

305
00:19:44,008 --> 00:19:48,578
Yeah, I'd like to hear more about David's medical practice.

306
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:52,408
What kind of surgery
do you do, David?Surgery?

307
00:19:52,452 --> 00:19:55,890
Well, you know,
um, whatever comes up.

308
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:58,849
Hearts, brains.

309
00:19:58,893 --> 00:20:03,550
Well, I hope you weren't
that doctor who operated
on my neighbor Sylvia Klein.

310
00:20:03,593 --> 00:20:06,379
I don't believe so.That's good.

311
00:20:06,422 --> 00:20:08,163
Because she died.

312
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,991
Who died?Sylvia Klein.

313
00:20:10,034 --> 00:20:12,385
She didn't die.

314
00:20:12,428 --> 00:20:15,083
Of course she died.

315
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:17,346
I don't think she died. What, have you talked to her lately?

316
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,392
I never talk to her.
You talk to her.

317
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:21,742
Not anymore.
She died!

318
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:24,614
- She didn't die.
- You don't know what
you're talking about.

319
00:20:24,658 --> 00:20:27,661
Now I don't know
what I'm talking about?

320
00:20:27,704 --> 00:20:30,838
We made a condolence call, remember? When?

321
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:34,189
Last summer. We went
to her daughter's house.

322
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:39,499
Remember the one
with the mouth?
She lives in Buffalo Grove.

323
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:42,241
- That was for Sylvia Klein?
- Yes.

324
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:45,156
- What happened?
- She died.

325
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,158
Can I have
some more cake?Stop that!

326
00:20:47,202 --> 00:20:51,293
Your-Your-Your veins
are all clogged up.

327
00:20:51,337 --> 00:20:55,906
It's my birthday!You're gonna kill yourself
eating all that chazerai.

328
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,519
I'm not gonna kill myself. You wanna listen to my heart?

329
00:20:59,562 --> 00:21:01,869
You know,
I-I-I don't have my--

330
00:21:01,912 --> 00:21:04,915
I left my black bag
and stuff. So, sorry.

331
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:08,615
120 over 80.
Perfect every time.

332
00:21:08,658 --> 00:21:10,921
That's wonderful.Yes, it's wonderful now.

333
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:15,099
Last summer, he had a T.I.A.
It wasn't so "wonderful."

334
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:17,537
You had a T.I.A.?

335
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,104
What is a T.I.A.?

336
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:22,890
T.I.A. stands for
"transient ischemic attack."

337
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:26,154
And, what causes that?

338
00:21:26,197 --> 00:21:28,939
It's usually
caused by a blockage
in the carotid artery...

339
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:31,333
that supplies blood
to the brain.

340
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:36,207
Studies have shown that
an aspirin can help reduce
the chance of a reoccurrence.

341
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:39,080
Did your doctor prescribe aspirin for you?One a day.

342
00:21:39,123 --> 00:21:43,345
- That should be all right.
What's your doctor's name?
- Dr. Hayden. Highland Park.

343
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:46,435
Good man.

344
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:49,960
So, David, do you
and Sarah have plans
for the weekend?

345
00:21:50,004 --> 00:21:53,355
You know, we hadn't
really thought about it.--

346
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:56,184
Sarah,
on the radio tomorrow,

347
00:21:56,227 --> 00:21:59,405
they're playing La Traviata
with Renee Fleming.

348
00:21:59,448 --> 00:22:02,625
I love La Traviata.You like the opera?

349
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:04,758
I love the opera.
I went to the opera
last night.

350
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:07,848
You didn't tell me
you went to the opera
last night.

351
00:22:07,891 --> 00:22:12,026
No, I didn't go
with Sarah. I went
with my-- my aunt.

352
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:14,942
Well, who
is your aunt?

353
00:22:14,985 --> 00:22:17,640
You don't know her.Well, what's her name?

354
00:22:17,684 --> 00:22:22,732
Her name?
Her name is, 
Sylvia Klein.

355
00:22:22,776 --> 00:22:26,997
Another Sylvia Klein.
The lightning strikes twice.

356
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,913
It's amazing, isn't it?

357
00:22:29,957 --> 00:22:33,787
You know,
I love the opera.

358
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:37,399
For 40 years,
every Saturday afternoon,

359
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:39,793
I listened to opera
from the Met.

360
00:22:39,836 --> 00:22:42,665
But you never go?No.

361
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:45,451
Well, Abe wouldn't
sit through it.

362
00:22:45,494 --> 00:22:47,148
Well, I'll tell you what.Yeah?

363
00:22:47,191 --> 00:22:51,195
It would be my honor
to escort you to the opera
sometime.

364
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:54,111
Really?I'll tell you what.
I have a card right here--

365
00:22:54,155 --> 00:22:57,376
Bob! Dave!

366
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:59,769
Dave Bob.Dave Bob.

367
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:01,641
It's a nickname.

368
00:23:01,684 --> 00:23:04,731
My full name is David
Robert Steinberg.

369
00:23:04,774 --> 00:23:07,821
David Robert Steinberg.I go by either one.

370
00:23:07,864 --> 00:23:11,433
Will you look at the time?
It's-- It's late.
We should get going.

371
00:23:11,477 --> 00:23:13,174
Well, it's not
that late, honey.

372
00:23:13,217 --> 00:23:16,917
Daddy, you have to go
to work tomorrow.
You need your rest.

373
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,921
Well, let's take a picture
before you go.
I'll get the camera.

374
00:23:20,964 --> 00:23:23,402
Mom, you always have to
take pictures?Yes, I do.

375
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:26,100
When my children are together, it's special.

376
00:23:26,143 --> 00:23:29,277
Come on, shorty. Now, David, you join her.

377
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,411
Really?Yes. Come on.
Smush together.

378
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:34,325
Get over there. Smush together, both of you.Kids, kids.

379
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:36,502
All right, smile. That's it.

380
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:41,463
Okay, now one
of the whole Goldman family.

381
00:23:41,507 --> 00:23:44,292
- I hate to have
my picture taken.
- Come on, Ma.

382
00:23:44,335 --> 00:23:46,860
Mrs. Goldman, get in there.
You look beautiful.I don't like pictures.

383
00:23:46,903 --> 00:23:49,906
Okay.

384
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:52,213
- Okay, everybody get in there.
Get in there.
- All right.

385
00:23:52,256 --> 00:23:55,085
Give a smile.

386
00:23:55,129 --> 00:23:58,001
One, two, three.

387
00:23:58,045 --> 00:23:59,612
Perfect.

388
00:23:59,655 --> 00:24:01,918
Now one of David and Sarah.
Come on.

389
00:24:01,962 --> 00:24:04,051
Mom, that's enough pictures.No!

390
00:24:04,094 --> 00:24:07,750
Mom, that's enough pictures. Come on, honey. Just one picture.

391
00:24:07,794 --> 00:24:12,102
Come on, sweetheart. We hardly have any pictures of the two of us together.

392
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:14,191
Okay, get in close.

393
00:24:14,235 --> 00:24:16,672
How close do you want us?

394
00:24:16,716 --> 00:24:19,588
Depends what you mean
by close. You want a pose.

395
00:24:19,632 --> 00:24:21,851
Sure. Why not?

396
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,902
Beautiful!

397
00:24:28,945 --> 00:24:32,732
I'd like a copy
of that one, please.

398
00:24:34,951 --> 00:24:38,520
Now, David, we want to see
a lot more of you,
so don't be a stranger.

399
00:24:38,564 --> 00:24:42,176
Well, we'll see
what we can do. It was very nice
meeting you, Mrs. Goldman.

400
00:24:42,219 --> 00:24:44,308
It was my extreme pleasure.

401
00:24:44,352 --> 00:24:46,615
Mr. Goldman.Nice to meet you.

402
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:49,096
Joel, see you again.I will look
forward to it.

403
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:50,837
All right. Good-bye.Good night.

404
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,535
You call me tomorrow.
Sarah, you call me.Yes.

405
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:56,407
Good-bye.Good night. Drive safely!

406
00:25:07,418 --> 00:25:09,986
You could have told me
I was a doctor.

407
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,253
I can't believe I did that.I couldn't believe it.
I almost lost it right there.

408
00:25:16,297 --> 00:25:19,909
I'm so sorry.
You were amazing.

409
00:25:19,953 --> 00:25:22,042
I don't know.
I don't think Joel
was buying it.

410
00:25:22,085 --> 00:25:24,784
No, he was. He was.He kept watching me.

411
00:25:24,827 --> 00:25:27,569
He's a therapist.
He does that to everybody.

412
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:31,486
You were just amazing.I just thought of all the
doctor stuff I could think of.

413
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,923
How did you know
what a T.I.A. is?

414
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:37,274
My father had a T.I.A.
It was the only thing
I would have known.

415
00:25:37,318 --> 00:25:40,626
If they would have asked me
how to stop a nosebleed,
I would have been screwed.

416
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:43,759
- You were perfect. I was
the one who almost lost it.
- No, you were great.

417
00:25:43,803 --> 00:25:47,458
The way you said
the blessing over the wine,
I-- I couldn't believe it.

418
00:25:47,502 --> 00:25:51,071
I heard it doin'Fiddler. It was like an old song lyric comin' back to me.

419
00:25:51,114 --> 00:25:52,942
I mean, you were
absolutely brilliant.

420
00:25:52,986 --> 00:25:56,859
I'll tell you one thing,
this is definitely
going in my diary.

421
00:26:17,532 --> 00:26:19,447
Well--

422
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:23,582
Well, quite a night?

423
00:26:25,366 --> 00:26:28,761
Let me just, um--

424
00:26:28,804 --> 00:26:31,938
Hey, listen.
Don't worry about it.
This one's on me.

425
00:26:31,981 --> 00:26:34,636
No, don't be silly.
You earned it.

426
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,682
Well, the pleasure
was all mine.

427
00:26:36,725 --> 00:26:40,337
The pleasure was mine...
and my parents.

428
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:42,339
How should I make it out?

429
00:26:42,383 --> 00:26:45,647
The Heaven-Sent
Escort Agency.

430
00:26:48,911 --> 00:26:51,044
I don't know how I'm gonna
log this one in the books.

431
00:26:51,087 --> 00:26:54,221
Can you get arrested
for impersonating a Jew
in this state?

432
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,747
Hey, whoa.
No, this is too much.

433
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:02,925
No, I insist.
You earned it.

434
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:05,885
I just-- I wish I could
give you an Academy Award
to go with it.

435
00:27:07,582 --> 00:27:09,279
I don't think there's
a category for that.

436
00:27:14,328 --> 00:27:16,852
You really saved
my life tonight.

437
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:21,465
Glad to be of service.

438
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:26,688
Well--

439
00:27:28,168 --> 00:27:29,735
Well--

440
00:27:40,615 --> 00:27:44,358
Hey, listen, 
if you know anyone that
ever needs an escort service--

441
00:27:44,401 --> 00:27:46,665
You will be
highly recommended.

442
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:48,362
Thanks.

443
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:52,235
And don't forget.
Tomorrow afternoon,

444
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:54,368
La Traviatafrom the Met.

445
00:27:54,411 --> 00:27:56,413
Got it.

446
00:27:58,938 --> 00:28:01,592
Well, it was nice
meeting you.It was very nice meeting you.

447
00:28:01,636 --> 00:28:05,118
Okay, um, good-bye.

448
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:07,076
Good-bye.

449
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:14,867
And thank you.

00:28:31,231 --> 00:28:33,668
Hi.

Hi.

454
00:28:40,936 --> 00:28:42,764
Share with Tom.

455
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:46,986
That's it.It's your mom.

456
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:48,770
What?

457
00:28:48,814 --> 00:28:50,990
Why? Hello?

458
00:28:51,033 --> 00:28:54,210
Sarah, he's so tall.

459
00:28:54,254 --> 00:28:58,954
Why didn't you tell me
he's so tall? He could be
the Jewish Wilt Chamberlain.

460
00:29:34,947 --> 00:29:37,210
I called Joel.
He called the caterer...

461
00:29:37,253 --> 00:29:39,038
and they set
an extra place for David.

462
00:29:39,081 --> 00:29:41,301
No.

463
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:44,608
How could you come
to the bar mitzvah
and not bring David?

464
00:29:44,652 --> 00:29:46,393
Call me.

465

Hi!

467
00:30:48,411 --> 00:30:50,544
How are you?Fine. How are you?

468
00:30:50,587 --> 00:30:52,981
Fine, fine.

469
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:54,722
What are you doing
on Saturday?

470
00:30:56,289 --> 00:30:59,945
Sarah, listen.
I already told
the escort service...

471
00:30:59,988 --> 00:31:02,469
that I've got
another commitment.

472
00:31:02,512 --> 00:31:05,080
I'll pay you double.
Whatever else you're doing,
I will pay you double.

473
00:31:05,124 --> 00:31:07,126
That's not the point.No, off the books.

474
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:10,259
I'll pay you off the books.
You won't even have
to pay your commission.

475
00:31:10,303 --> 00:31:12,218
Sarah, listen,
I don't really have
another commitment.

476
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:14,437
You lied?

477
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:16,787
Y-Yes.That's terrible.

478
00:31:16,831 --> 00:31:18,659
How could you do that?

479
00:31:18,702 --> 00:31:21,270
I-I don't like to lie.
That's why I can't help you.

480
00:31:21,314 --> 00:31:23,446
I don't wanna be
Dr. David Steinberg again.

481
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:26,275
But you were so great.I don't know.

482
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:28,799
We pulled it off once. I don't
think we can do it again.Sure, we can.

483
00:31:28,843 --> 00:31:32,107
Of course we can.I don't know.

484
00:31:32,151 --> 00:31:35,502
We can. We can.

485
00:31:35,545 --> 00:31:37,983
Sarah, listen.
I have an audition.I know.

486
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:41,508
I arranged it.

487
00:31:41,551 --> 00:31:43,510
What?

488
00:31:45,338 --> 00:31:47,601
I didn't know how to get
in touch with you.

489
00:31:47,644 --> 00:31:51,387
I have a friend who's
a casting director here.
She works with Chris.

490
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:56,001
I asked her if she had anything
coming up that you'd be
right for, and she did.

491
00:31:56,044 --> 00:31:59,656
So I had her call your agent,
so your agent would call you...

492
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,659
and... tell you
to be here now.

493
00:32:05,488 --> 00:32:08,187
This is crazy.Well, what do they say?

494
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:12,278
Desperation is
the mother of invention.

495
00:32:12,321 --> 00:32:16,456
But I thought the plan was
for your parents to meet
Dr. David Steinberg once,

496
00:32:16,499 --> 00:32:18,458
and then they wouldn't
ask to meet him again.

497
00:32:18,501 --> 00:32:20,939
That was the plan.What happened?

498
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:23,115
Well, I was wrong.

499
00:32:24,681 --> 00:32:26,814
Bob-- I mean,

500
00:32:26,857 --> 00:32:29,425
you don't know what
I've been through
this past week.

501
00:32:29,469 --> 00:32:31,688
My mother--
She talks about you...

502
00:32:31,732 --> 00:32:35,866
like, you're a combination
of Albert Schweitzer...

503
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:38,086
and Alan Alda.

504
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,349
Is Alan Alda Jewish?

505
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:43,178
Part Jewish I think.
I-I-- I don't know.

506
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:47,095
So did you really
get me this audition?

507
00:32:48,749 --> 00:32:50,969
Yes.

508
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:54,494
It's for a national spot.Well, that's good, right?

509
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:57,627
It's great, if I book it. I'm sure you will.

510
00:32:57,671 --> 00:33:00,500
You're a--
You're a brilliant actor.
You have so much talent.

511
00:33:00,543 --> 00:33:04,025
You are.
You are so talented.All right, all right.

512
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:06,027
You really think
I'm brilliant?

513
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:10,336
Brando, Pacino, Schroeder.

514
00:33:12,686 --> 00:33:14,775
All right.

515
00:33:14,818 --> 00:33:17,038
What's happening
this Saturday?

516
00:33:17,082 --> 00:33:19,301
My nephew's bar mitzvah.

517
00:33:19,345 --> 00:33:21,303
Do we have to go to synagogue?Just for a couple of hours.

518
00:33:21,347 --> 00:33:23,653
And we'll be in services,
so you won't have to
talk to anybody.

519
00:33:23,697 --> 00:33:25,699
Do I have to do
anything special?No, no, not at all.

520
00:33:25,742 --> 00:33:27,875
The rabbi tells you
when to stand up
and when to sit down.

521
00:33:27,918 --> 00:33:30,921
Just when you stand up,
you can bob up and down
a little bit...

522
00:33:30,965 --> 00:33:33,489
to make it look like
you're praying.

523
00:33:33,533 --> 00:33:37,102
What time?I'll pick you up
about 9:00.

524
00:33:37,145 --> 00:33:39,756
Are you allowed
to drive on Saturday?

525
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,150
We're Jew-ish.
We're not that Jewish.

526
00:33:42,194 --> 00:33:44,979
This is the last time,
right?

527
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:48,374
Bob, this is the last time.
I promise.

528
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:53,944
Good Shabbes.Good Shabbes.

529
00:34:07,697 --> 00:34:11,832
You know, the service
is just about to begin.

530

Good Shabbes.Good Shabbes.

531
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:17,055
Good Shabbes.
It's so good to see you.Good to see you too.

532
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:19,231
Baby.Good Shabbes.

533
00:34:19,274 --> 00:34:21,320
Good Shabbes.We are so happy
you're here.

534
00:34:21,363 --> 00:34:23,931
You were able to take off
from the hospital.

535
00:34:23,974 --> 00:34:27,500
Yeah. I just told them
to make sure nobody was
sick while I was gone.

536
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:31,895
Good Shabbes.Good Shabbes.

537
00:34:31,939 --> 00:34:34,724
Sarah, this is
the dress you wore?

538
00:34:34,768 --> 00:34:37,118
You bought me
this dress.Ten years ago.

539
00:34:37,162 --> 00:34:40,730
It wasn't ten years ago.
I thought you liked
this dress.

540
00:34:40,774 --> 00:34:43,864
For Danny's bar mitzvah,
you could buy a new dress.

541
00:34:43,907 --> 00:34:47,563
Mom, I don't need a new dress.Sarah, you need
a new dress.

542
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:51,480
I got new shoes.Those are new shoes?

543

That is a portable

575

Covers all of North America,
including Alaska
and Hawaii.

576
00:37:45,045 --> 00:37:47,656
Plus, it's an MP3 player.

577
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:51,486
I've already programmed all
the songs, so all you do is plug
it into your car stereo system,

578
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,793
and it'll play
Simon and Garfunkel's Greatest Hits--

579
00:37:53,836 --> 00:37:58,188

for how to get from here--
your place-- to my place.

Thank you.
Thanks.Yeah? Right?

I'm sorry I didn't
get you anything.

00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:06,936
All I want
for our anniversary
is for us to be together.

Chris, please.

584
00:38:10,549 --> 00:38:12,812
I'm gonna call you
every day from L.A.

585
00:38:12,855 --> 00:38:16,598
You don't have to call me
every day.Do you know what I wish?

586
00:38:16,642 --> 00:38:19,688
What?Do you really wanna know
what I wish?

587
00:38:19,732 --> 00:38:22,343
What?

588
00:38:22,387 --> 00:38:26,739
I wish we could go somewhere
together, just to like
a tropical location somewhere.

589
00:38:26,782 --> 00:38:31,961
Somewhere exotic and just eat
coconuts and sea anemones
or something.

590
00:38:32,005 --> 00:38:33,963
Just like that?Just like that.

591
00:38:34,007 --> 00:38:36,270
Just leave work?Leave work!

592
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,969
Give up your accounts,
sell your car?

593
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:46,236
You know what else
we could do? You could just
tell your parents about us.

594
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,370
You could say, "Parents,
Chris and I love each other
and wanna be together forever.

595
00:38:49,414 --> 00:38:52,895
And if you don't like it,
you can just lump it."

596
00:38:52,939 --> 00:38:55,028
Or don't say "lump it"
'cause they're your parents.

597
00:38:55,071 --> 00:38:58,161
But I can have Bruce
or somebody help you
with the copy.

598
00:38:58,205 --> 00:39:01,687
You're pressuring me, Chris.
Don't pressure me.
I'm under enough pressure.

599
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:04,733
I have to do the seder
tonight, and my whole
family's coming over. It's--

600
00:39:04,777 --> 00:39:07,345
And Bob?

601
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:09,999
And-And Bob.Aha!

602
00:39:10,043 --> 00:39:11,827
Don't say "aha."I knew it!

603
00:39:11,871 --> 00:39:14,743
No, don't say "aha."
There's no reason
to say "aha."

604
00:39:17,442 --> 00:39:20,401
I really hate this.I know.

605
00:39:20,445 --> 00:39:22,882
Look, Chris, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

606
00:39:22,925 --> 00:39:25,145
You have to go!Yeah, I know I have to go.

607
00:39:25,188 --> 00:39:29,584
I have to leave town and work
while my stand-in gets to do
all the fun bits.

608
00:39:29,628 --> 00:39:32,631
The fu--
Chris, come on.
This is not fun.

609
00:39:36,504 --> 00:39:38,288
I love you.

610
00:39:39,942 --> 00:39:41,422
Go. Go.

611
00:40:04,184 --> 00:40:07,274
I don't think
we should do this.What are you talking about?

612
00:40:07,317 --> 00:40:09,711
I just don't think we can
get away with it again.

613
00:40:09,755 --> 00:40:12,018
They're gonna be here
in a minute!I know. Look.

614
00:40:12,061 --> 00:40:14,716
Can't you just tell them
I had a medical emergency
come up?

615
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,066
I told them that
last night.

616
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,723
I told them
that you had heart
and brain surgery to do.

617
00:40:21,767 --> 00:40:23,769
See, that's what
I'm talking about.

618
00:40:23,812 --> 00:40:25,553
Bob, please.

619
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,515
I just don't think we can
get away with this again.

620
00:40:30,558 --> 00:40:33,431
We can! We can!
Just this one more time.

621
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:35,955
You should have seen
my mother last night.

622
00:40:35,998 --> 00:40:38,914
She was so heartbroken
when I told her you couldn't
come to her seder,

623
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:40,916
she set a place
for you anyway.

624
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,918
It was so pitiful.

625
00:40:42,962 --> 00:40:45,312
I mean, there was
a cup of wine for
the prophet Elijah,

626
00:40:45,355 --> 00:40:47,357
and gefilte fish
for you.

627
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:52,450
Well, I guess...

628
00:40:52,493 --> 00:40:55,714
at least one of us
should show up
for dinner tonight.

629
00:40:55,757 --> 00:40:58,020
Thank you.

630
00:40:58,064 --> 00:41:00,283

631

- Thanks for messaging
over that Haggadah.
- You're welcome.

632
00:41:09,554 --> 00:41:13,819
Um, did you have a chance
to look at it?I-- I did.

633
00:41:13,862 --> 00:41:17,997
- I'm not too clear on the order
of what happens when.
- Just watch me.

634
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,999
Everything's announced
before we do it anyway.

635
00:41:20,042 --> 00:41:22,262
Do you guys really drink
four glasses of wine?--

636
00:41:22,305 --> 00:41:26,048
Depending on how closely
my father decides
to follow the scripts.

637
00:41:26,092 --> 00:41:28,616
You guys must get
really wasted then.

638
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:32,751
Well, it's one
of our festive holidays.
Don't I look festive?

639

649

How are ya?How'd that heart
and brain surgery go?

650
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,022
Well, that was something.

651
00:42:27,066 --> 00:42:29,851
They-They brought this guy in.
There was blood everywhere.

652
00:42:29,895 --> 00:42:32,854
And they had the surgeons
and-- You ever seen E.R.?

653
00:42:32,898 --> 00:42:35,901
Yeah.It was just like that.

654
00:42:35,944 --> 00:42:38,251
Everybody wanna
sit down?

655
00:42:38,294 --> 00:42:40,079
We'll start.

656

a beautiful table.Thanks, Mom.

657

Joel, you couldn't
bring the boys?

658
00:42:52,221 --> 00:42:54,267
I brought them
to your house
last night,

659
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:56,704
and Barbara has them
at her parents' tonight.

660
00:42:56,748 --> 00:42:59,489
What, they make
a seder?I don't know.

661
00:42:59,533 --> 00:43:01,970
Joel, the boys need to be
at a seder tonight.

662
00:43:02,014 --> 00:43:05,321
I don't know
if they're doing a seder.Well, call and ask.

663
00:43:05,365 --> 00:43:08,716
I'm not gonna call them.Joel.

664

They're doing a seder
there tonight. All right?

665
00:43:12,938 --> 00:43:14,896
All right. All right.

666

Abe, why don't you start?

667
00:43:40,269 --> 00:43:43,011
Open the Haggadah.
First we'll do a kiddush.

668
00:43:50,715 --> 00:43:52,368
Amein. Amein.

669
00:44:02,814 --> 00:44:05,207
Next we do thekarpas. Parsley. Everybody take some parsley.

670
00:44:15,217 --> 00:44:17,219
Amein. Amein.

671
00:44:20,353 --> 00:44:23,922
Next, theafikoman.
Give me the matzo.

672
00:44:23,965 --> 00:44:27,490
David, would you and Sarah
steal the afikoman?

673
00:44:27,534 --> 00:44:30,580
Maybe.

674
00:44:30,624 --> 00:44:32,713
Next--

675
00:44:32,757 --> 00:44:35,542
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
That's my pager.

676
00:44:35,585 --> 00:44:37,675
I'm on call.On Pesach?

677
00:44:37,718 --> 00:44:40,634
I'm sorry. I hope
it's not too serious.

678
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:44,464
I'm gonna have to call in.
Please, go on without me.

679
00:44:44,507 --> 00:44:48,250
No, no, no. We'll wait.
We'll wait. Make your call.
We'll wait for the doctor.

680
00:44:48,294 --> 00:44:51,253
- Excuse me.
- We'll wait.

681
00:44:54,474 --> 00:44:56,432
This is Dr. David Steinberg.
Did somebody page me?

682
00:44:56,476 --> 00:44:58,304
This is when you wanted me
to call you, right?

683
00:45:02,177 --> 00:45:04,614
Dear.
Just give me a sec.

684
00:45:04,658 --> 00:45:07,226
I'm sorry.

685
00:45:07,269 --> 00:45:11,186
It is serious.You don't have to go,
do you?

686
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:15,364
David, please.
Don't have to go.

687
00:45:24,243 --> 00:45:27,289
This is Dr. Steinberg.You can get out
of there now, right?

688
00:45:27,333 --> 00:45:32,294
- I'd really rather not commit.
- You are one nutty kind of guy.

689
00:45:32,338 --> 00:45:34,949
Well, who's the resident
that's on call?

690
00:45:34,993 --> 00:45:38,779
That should be fine.
If you have any problems,
feel free to call me.

691
00:45:38,823 --> 00:45:42,391
Rhubarb, rhubarb,
peas and carrots--

692
00:45:42,435 --> 00:45:45,003
Now, look! I told you
that the resident on call
is fine.

693
00:45:45,046 --> 00:45:47,440
This is a very sacred holiday
for my people.

694
00:45:47,483 --> 00:45:50,225
And I'm gonna celebrate it
with my loved ones.

695
00:45:50,269 --> 00:45:53,272
It's all right.
It's all right.

696
00:45:53,315 --> 00:45:55,796
It's all right.
Okay. Good-bye.

697
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,059
Toodles.

698
00:46:00,409 --> 00:46:03,978
So, are we gonna
take it from the top,

699
00:46:04,022 --> 00:46:06,676
or are we gonna pick up
where we left off?

700
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,071
No, we can--
we can pick up
where we are. Daddy?

701
00:46:10,115 --> 00:46:13,466
- Next, the four questions.
Who does the four questions?
- Sarah.

702
00:46:13,509 --> 00:46:17,252
Can we skip
the four questions? Skip the four questions.

703
00:46:17,296 --> 00:46:21,343
David, when Sarah was
a little girl, she loved
to ask the four questions.

704
00:46:21,387 --> 00:46:23,345
Mother. No.

705
00:46:23,389 --> 00:46:26,087
Even when she was so little
she couldn't even say
the words.

706
00:46:26,131 --> 00:46:29,047
But she knew it was
something important.

707
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:32,528
Her little eyes
would be wide open,
taking it all in.

708
00:46:32,572 --> 00:46:36,010
She was always
so helpful.

709
00:46:36,054 --> 00:46:38,665
And we'd say, "Sarah,
ask the four questions."

710
00:46:38,708 --> 00:46:42,147
And she'd sing
"Happy Birthday" instead.

711
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:44,671
She was so adorable.

712
00:46:44,714 --> 00:46:47,717
That's a great story.

713
00:46:47,761 --> 00:46:51,678
Don't encourage her.
She'll bring out
baby pictures.

714
00:46:51,721 --> 00:46:54,855
That reminds me of a story
of when I was a kid
growing up.

715
00:46:54,899 --> 00:46:58,467
- Does it?
- When I was a little boy,

716
00:46:58,511 --> 00:47:02,123
I grew up in a neighborhood
with a couple
of gentile families.

717
00:47:02,167 --> 00:47:06,127
I remember my little gentile
friends talking about Santa
Claus bringing 'em presents.

718
00:47:06,171 --> 00:47:09,087
And one Passover,
I asked my father,

719
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:13,874
"If Elijah comes,
will he bring presents
like Santa Claus?"

720
00:47:13,918 --> 00:47:18,487
And my father said,
"If Elijah comes, he'll bring
the greatest present of all--

721
00:47:18,531 --> 00:47:21,664
peace."

722
00:47:21,708 --> 00:47:26,017
And I said, "If Santa Claus
brings presents every year
for my friends,

723
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:29,281
when will Elijah
bring his present?"

724
00:47:29,324 --> 00:47:32,240
And my father said,
"We don't know,

725
00:47:32,284 --> 00:47:34,634
"but we hope
he'll come soon.

726
00:47:34,677 --> 00:47:38,638
That's what we Jews do.
We hope."

727
00:47:41,336 --> 00:47:43,861
That's beautiful.

728
00:47:43,904 --> 00:47:47,386
- That's a beautiful story.
- That is so beautiful!

729
00:47:50,955 --> 00:47:54,872
You know, I heard a story
just like that
on the radio today.

730
00:47:54,915 --> 00:47:57,918
No! I did.

731
00:48:01,574 --> 00:48:04,490
David, would you do
the four questions?

732
00:48:04,533 --> 00:48:07,188
Why, yes.

733
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,541
"Why is this night different
from all other nights?"

734
00:48:12,585 --> 00:48:14,456
Need we ask?

735
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,546
"For on all other nights,
we eat either leavened
or unleavened bread.

736
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:20,158
"Why on this night
only unleavened bread?

737
00:48:20,201 --> 00:48:22,769
"On all other nights,
we eat all kinds of herbs.

738
00:48:22,812 --> 00:48:25,206
"Why on this night
only bitter herbs?

739
00:48:27,165 --> 00:48:30,690
"On all other nights,
we need not dip
our herbs even once.

740
00:48:30,733 --> 00:48:33,823
"Why on this night must we dip them twice?

741
00:48:33,867 --> 00:48:38,480
"On all other nights,
we eat either sitting up
or reclining.

742
00:48:38,524 --> 00:48:41,657
Why on this night
do we all recline?"

743
00:48:41,701 --> 00:48:43,659
Good questions.

744
00:48:43,703 --> 00:48:47,141
"We were slaves.

745
00:48:47,185 --> 00:48:49,056
Then we were free."
Let's eat.

746
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,972
Abe, read a little more.
Come on.

747
00:48:52,016 --> 00:48:55,236
Next, the matzo.
Give me the matzo.

748
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,456
Thank you.

749
00:48:57,499 --> 00:49:02,591
"This matzo which we eat--
What is the reason for it?

750
00:49:02,635 --> 00:49:07,031
"Because the dough
of our fathers
had not yet leaven,

751
00:49:07,074 --> 00:49:09,598
"When the king over all kings,
the holy one,

752
00:49:09,642 --> 00:49:11,600
"blessed be he,

753
00:49:11,644 --> 00:49:14,995
"revealed himself to them and redeemed them.

754
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:17,476
"As it is said:

755
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:19,434
"And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough,

756
00:49:19,478 --> 00:49:22,220
"which they brought forth out of Egypt,

757
00:49:22,263 --> 00:49:24,874
"for it was not leavened.

758
00:49:24,918 --> 00:49:28,748
"Because they were
thrust out of Egypt
and could not tarry,

759
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:33,231
neither had they
prepared for themselves
any victuals."

760
00:49:33,274 --> 00:49:36,538
Joel, will you read?

761
00:49:36,582 --> 00:49:40,455
"These bitter herbs we eat-- What is the reason
for them?

762
00:49:40,499 --> 00:49:44,677
"Because the Egyptians made
the lives of our forefathers
bitter in Egypt.

763
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,940
"As it is said:

764
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:50,857
"And they made their life
bitter with hard service
in mortar and in brick,

765
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:54,426
"and in all manner of service
in the fields
in all their service,

766
00:49:54,469 --> 00:49:58,604
wherein they made them serve
with rigor."

767
00:49:58,647 --> 00:50:01,607
David?

768
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:04,523
"In every generation, let each man look on himself...

769
00:50:04,566 --> 00:50:07,004
"as if he came forth
out of Egypt.

770
00:50:07,047 --> 00:50:08,875
"As it is said:

771
00:50:08,918 --> 00:50:11,008
"And thou shalt tell thy son in that day...

772
00:50:11,051 --> 00:50:14,533
"saying, '‘It is because
of that which the lord
did for me...

773
00:50:14,576 --> 00:50:17,536
"when I came forth
out of Egypt.'

774
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:20,539
"Therefore, we are bound
to thank,

775
00:50:20,582 --> 00:50:23,455
"praise, laud, glorify,

776
00:50:23,498 --> 00:50:27,111
"exalt, honor,
bless, extol...

777
00:50:27,154 --> 00:50:29,722
"and adore him
who performed
all these miracles...

778
00:50:29,765 --> 00:50:32,551
"for our fathers
and for us.

779
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,905
"He has brought us
from slavery to freedom,

780
00:50:38,948 --> 00:50:41,081
"from sorrow to joy,

781
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:44,041
"from mourning to holiday,

782
00:50:44,084 --> 00:50:46,565
"from darkness
to great light...

783
00:50:46,608 --> 00:50:49,611
and from bondage
to redemption."

784
00:50:51,396 --> 00:50:54,442
Wow.

785
00:50:54,486 --> 00:50:57,358
"Let us then recite before him
a new psalm.

786
00:50:57,402 --> 00:50:59,447
Hallelujah."

787
00:51:01,884 --> 00:51:03,843
Good night.

788
00:51:03,886 --> 00:51:05,540
Night.Drive safely.

789
00:51:12,982 --> 00:51:15,246
I'm exhausted.

790
00:51:15,289 --> 00:51:18,249
We made it. Relax.

791
00:51:18,292 --> 00:51:21,208
"Relax." What a concept.

792
00:51:21,252 --> 00:51:23,254
Tense times?

793
00:51:24,255 --> 00:51:27,606
No. No, no.
I've always been tense.

794
00:51:27,649 --> 00:51:30,478
When I was in high school,
I went out for
the swim team,

795
00:51:30,522 --> 00:51:33,568
and they used me
for the diving board.

796
00:51:33,612 --> 00:51:35,657
That's funny.

797
00:51:36,919 --> 00:51:38,878
Well, you were brilliant---

798
00:51:38,921 --> 00:51:41,489
Again.It was so funny...

799
00:51:41,533 --> 00:51:43,317
the way your dad
whipped through
the Haggadah.

800
00:51:43,361 --> 00:51:45,624
Yeah.

801
00:51:45,667 --> 00:51:49,018
My father has
a very particular
view of life.

802
00:51:49,062 --> 00:51:52,935
You know, he treats
business matters
religiously,

803
00:51:52,979 --> 00:51:56,113
and religious matters
like business.

804
00:51:58,593 --> 00:52:02,249
I-- Can I get you
anything?No, I'm fine.

805
00:52:02,293 --> 00:52:05,165
Something to express
my appreciation?

806
00:52:05,209 --> 00:52:07,167
Can I buy you a drink?

807
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:10,039
Can I--
Can I buy you a car?

808
00:52:10,083 --> 00:52:14,261
Actually,
when I was a kid,

809
00:52:15,871 --> 00:52:18,700
after a school performance
or something like that,

810
00:52:18,744 --> 00:52:22,008
my mother would take me
to get ice cream.

811
00:52:24,271 --> 00:52:28,057
Well, I'd--
I'd be delighted
to buy you some ice cream.

812
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:30,973
Are you allowed
to have ice cream on Passover?

813
00:52:33,411 --> 00:52:37,806
If I'm not mistaken,
both Ben and Jerry
are Jewish.

814
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:40,157
Perfect.

815
00:52:42,028 --> 00:52:45,205
- What can I get for you?
- I'll have a cup
of Cherry Garcia...

816
00:52:45,249 --> 00:52:47,729
- with lots of cherries, please.
- And for you?

817
00:52:47,773 --> 00:52:50,167
I'll have a scoop of chocolate
with chocolate syrup.

818
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:52,386
Can I get sprinkles?

819
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:54,171
Yes. You can get sprinkles.

820
00:52:54,214 --> 00:52:55,911
And sprinkles.You got it.

821
00:53:01,482 --> 00:53:04,398
So where'd you get
that beeper?
That was pretty clever.

822
00:53:04,442 --> 00:53:06,270
Yeah, I borrowed it
from a buddy of mine...

823
00:53:06,313 --> 00:53:08,533
that does a lot
of commercial work,

824
00:53:08,576 --> 00:53:12,493
and I had a friend call me
in case I needed an excuse
to leave early.

825
00:53:12,537 --> 00:53:16,018
Well, thank you
for not leaving.

826
00:53:16,062 --> 00:53:19,587
I'm glad I stayed.Me too.

827
00:53:19,631 --> 00:53:21,154
Here you go.

828
00:53:22,634 --> 00:53:24,636
So, is there a blessing
for the ice cream?

829
00:53:26,681 --> 00:53:28,683
Cheers.

830
00:53:28,727 --> 00:53:31,033
L'chaim.

831
00:53:31,077 --> 00:53:33,819
So, have you always
wanted to be an actor?

832
00:53:33,862 --> 00:53:36,343
It's all I've ever
wanted to do.

833
00:53:36,387 --> 00:53:39,390
What do you do?I teach kindergarten.

834
00:53:39,433 --> 00:53:41,653
Kindergarten!

835
00:53:41,696 --> 00:53:45,047
I remember kindergarten.
I used to get straight A's
in sandbox.

836
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:47,049
Really?-

837
00:53:47,093 --> 00:53:50,096
I have one
little boy who loves
to play in the sandbox.

838
00:53:50,139 --> 00:53:52,272
His father
is an architect.

839
00:53:52,316 --> 00:53:54,840
He hires the other children
to build sand castles
for him.

840
00:53:54,883 --> 00:53:57,408
Let me take that for you.

841
00:53:59,845 --> 00:54:02,587
So, kindergarten?

842
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:05,372
Do you like it?Do I like it?

843
00:54:05,416 --> 00:54:08,419
You sound like my mother--
She always says,

844
00:54:08,462 --> 00:54:11,857
"Sarah is so smart,
they should let her
teach a higher grade."

845
00:54:14,163 --> 00:54:15,861
Do you want to sit down?Sure.

846
00:54:15,904 --> 00:54:18,080
Great.

847
00:54:18,124 --> 00:54:20,387
Anyway--

848
00:54:20,431 --> 00:54:24,391
But yes. Kindergarten
is my preference.-

849
00:54:24,435 --> 00:54:27,002
I don't have to spend
all my time on academics.

850
00:54:27,046 --> 00:54:30,963
I can give the children
more individual attention.

851
00:54:31,006 --> 00:54:33,835
Work on their
emotional development,

852
00:54:33,879 --> 00:54:37,491
so maybe they won't
end up as screwed up
as the rest of us.

853
00:54:39,145 --> 00:54:43,236
Think we're all screwed up?I don't know.

854
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,066
I look at the children
in my classroom,
and they're so open.

855
00:54:47,109 --> 00:54:50,199
They're so free.

856
00:54:50,243 --> 00:54:52,376
I don't remember
ever being that free.

857
00:54:54,726 --> 00:54:56,771
Well, what would
make you feel free?

858
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:03,822
If I could do one thing
that was just for me,

859
00:55:03,865 --> 00:55:07,173
without worrying
how my parents
will feel about it,

860
00:55:08,827 --> 00:55:10,742
that would be--

861
00:55:13,397 --> 00:55:15,137
Wow.

862
00:55:16,617 --> 00:55:18,837
I think your parents
are great.I do too.

863
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,492
I love my parents.

864
00:55:21,535 --> 00:55:24,277
They've sacrificed
their whole life for me,

865
00:55:26,061 --> 00:55:30,109
and they expect me
to sacrifice
my whole life for them.

866
00:55:34,592 --> 00:55:36,985
Remember that story I told?

867
00:55:37,029 --> 00:55:39,640
The one that was
on the radio?Yeah.

868
00:55:39,684 --> 00:55:42,991
Yeah. I wish
my father was like that.

869
00:55:43,035 --> 00:55:47,169
We never really got along.
He hated the idea
that I wanted to be an actor.

870
00:55:47,213 --> 00:55:50,085
We used to have these awful
drag-down, beat-out
arguments.

871
00:55:52,131 --> 00:55:55,395
You wanna hear
something wild?

872
00:55:55,439 --> 00:55:57,789
After each one
of these arguments,

873
00:55:57,832 --> 00:55:59,921
the very next time I saw him...

874
00:55:59,965 --> 00:56:02,750
he'd have bought me
a new pair of shoes.

875
00:56:02,794 --> 00:56:05,884
Just like that.
He'd go, "Here you go.
Here's some shoes."

876
00:56:05,927 --> 00:56:09,017
It used to drive me crazy.

877
00:56:09,061 --> 00:56:12,064
I could never figure it out.
Why shoes?

878
00:56:12,107 --> 00:56:14,675
Then it occurred to me...

879
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:16,895
that that was his way
of saying,

880
00:56:16,938 --> 00:56:20,246
no matter what,
that he loved me,

881
00:56:20,289 --> 00:56:23,205
and everything
was gonna be okay.

882
00:56:23,249 --> 00:56:25,251
But, boy,
you should have seen my closet.

883
00:56:25,294 --> 00:56:27,253
I had one suit
and 21 pairs of wing tips.

884
00:56:30,604 --> 00:56:32,563
So where's your father?

885
00:56:32,606 --> 00:56:34,782
Both my parents are dead.

886
00:56:36,131 --> 00:56:39,178
Um, I-I--
I'm so sorry.

887
00:56:39,221 --> 00:56:41,746
And, um, that's why
I envy you.

888
00:56:41,789 --> 00:56:43,835
The only family I really have...

889
00:56:43,878 --> 00:56:46,794
are the people I'm working with
on a show at any given time.

890
00:56:46,838 --> 00:56:49,406
My life is very transitory.

891
00:56:53,366 --> 00:56:56,238
Um, you know,
I was gonna tell you,

892
00:56:56,282 --> 00:57:00,242
a woman I went to school with
is a director with
the Milwaukee Rep.

893
00:57:00,286 --> 00:57:03,376
Have you ever
worked there?No, but I'd like to.

894
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,944
I'll tell her
to look out for you.

895
00:57:05,987 --> 00:57:08,033
I appreciate it.

896
00:57:08,076 --> 00:57:10,557
It's my pleasure.

897
00:57:10,601 --> 00:57:12,646
I'd-- I'd like
to see you perform.

898
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:14,561
You already have.

899
00:57:14,605 --> 00:57:16,824
In a show.

900
00:57:16,868 --> 00:57:20,132
I'm in between engagements
right now.

901
00:57:22,221 --> 00:57:26,181
Will you let me know
when you're in something?Definitely.

902
00:57:26,225 --> 00:57:28,357
I-I'd really love
to come see you.

903
00:57:28,401 --> 00:57:31,622
I'm very good.I-I'm sure you are.

904
00:57:31,665 --> 00:57:34,102
I'm sure you are.

905
00:57:36,583 --> 00:57:39,499
Well, um--

906
00:57:39,543 --> 00:57:43,024
We should, 
probably go.

907
00:57:44,765 --> 00:57:48,160
Yeah. Let's-- Sure.

908
00:57:48,203 --> 00:57:50,510
Let's, head back
to my apartment.

909
00:57:50,554 --> 00:57:52,904
I just have to grab
my checkbook.No, no, no.

910
00:57:52,947 --> 00:57:54,906
Sarah, seriously, I can't.

911
00:57:54,949 --> 00:57:57,996
No, I have to pay you.No, you don't.

912
00:57:58,039 --> 00:58:01,303
You allowed me
to spend Passover
with you and your family,

913
00:58:01,347 --> 00:58:03,871
and it was wonderful.

914
00:58:03,915 --> 00:58:06,221
Are you sure?Absolutely.

915
00:58:09,398 --> 00:58:11,357
Well, thank you.
Thank you...

916
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,447
for the dinner
and the ice cream.

917
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,231
I don't think
I'm gonna be hungry
till next Tuesday.

918
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,063
Well, um--

919
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:29,810
One thing
I wanted to ask you--What?

920
00:58:29,854 --> 00:58:32,204
That first night--

921
00:58:32,247 --> 00:58:34,380
when we were
at my parents'...

922
00:58:34,423 --> 00:58:37,557
and my father
took our picture,

923
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:40,081
and you kissed me--

924
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:43,171
Yeah?

925
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:48,307
Was that a David kiss,

926
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:51,702
or... a Bob kiss?

927
00:58:53,138 --> 00:58:55,314
That was a David kiss.

928
00:58:59,753 --> 00:59:01,755
This is a Bob kiss.

929
00:59:20,034 --> 00:59:24,212
Listen, I escorted
a nice elderly lady...

930
00:59:24,256 --> 00:59:26,432
to the theater last night.

931
00:59:26,475 --> 00:59:29,435
May I...

932
00:59:29,478 --> 00:59:31,829
sometime...

933
00:59:31,872 --> 00:59:33,918
escort you to the theater?

934
00:59:35,789 --> 00:59:37,617
I would like that.

935
00:59:37,661 --> 00:59:39,880
Great.

936
00:59:39,924 --> 00:59:44,276
Well, then, um,
I'll call you next week.

937
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:46,017
Okay.Okay.

938
00:59:57,028 --> 00:59:58,769
Why don't I call you
tomorrow?

939
01:00:00,466 --> 01:00:02,163
Okay.

940
01:00:14,785 --> 01:00:16,569
Why don't I call you
when I get home?

941
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,571
Okay.

942
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,972
Why don't we just
talk about it right now?

943
01:00:28,015 --> 01:00:31,149
Why don't we just
hang out for a while?

944
01:00:31,192 --> 01:00:33,151
Yeah.

945
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,162

What are these for?

987
01:02:54,161 --> 01:02:57,948
I'm breaking a cardinal rule.
I never assume I'm gonna
get a show before I get it.

988
01:02:57,991 --> 01:02:59,906
You're gonna be in a show?Not for sure.
I have an audition.

989
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:02,996
For what?But, thanks to you,

990
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,477
I really feel like
I'm gonna get this show.

991
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:09,481
What? What's the show?It's just
a little production called...

992
01:03:09,524 --> 01:03:11,439
Fiddler on the Roof.

993
01:03:11,483 --> 01:03:14,878

995
01:03:17,706 --> 01:03:21,145
I can't believe it.My agent called
and says, "Can you be Jewish?"

996
01:03:21,188 --> 01:03:24,496
And I said, "It's one
of the things I do best."You're gonna get it.

997
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:26,715
I feel really
prepared for it.When's the audition?

998
01:03:26,759 --> 01:03:29,370

"break a leg."

1008
01:04:33,957 --> 01:04:36,481
Congratulations.Thank you.

1009
01:04:36,524 --> 01:04:39,484
I-Is it okay
to say congratulations
to an actor?

1010
01:04:39,527 --> 01:04:43,531
Yes, could say
congratulations.That is great news.

1011
01:04:43,575 --> 01:04:46,883
Thank you.
I have some big news too.

1012
01:04:46,926 --> 01:04:49,233
Yeah?
What's your news?

1013
01:04:49,276 --> 01:04:51,496
My parents are coming over.

1014
01:04:51,539 --> 01:04:54,412
They'll be here pretty soon.
I was just getting ready.

1015
01:04:54,455 --> 01:04:56,544
Am-Am I allowed to be here?

1016
01:04:56,588 --> 01:04:58,459
Yeah. Yeah, I'd like you to be.

1017
01:04:58,503 --> 01:05:00,461
Great.

1018
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:05,597
So what's your big news? What's my big news?

1019
01:05:07,773 --> 01:05:10,341
- We're engaged.
- What?

1020
01:05:11,429 --> 01:05:14,214
Sorry.

1021
01:05:14,258 --> 01:05:16,738
Sarah, I take by "engaged"
you mean...

1022
01:05:16,782 --> 01:05:20,003
that you and Dr. Steinberg
are engaged? -

1023
01:05:20,046 --> 01:05:21,874
I'm sorry.
It just happened.

1024
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:24,659
I-- We're on the phone,

1025
01:05:24,703 --> 01:05:26,966
and she's giving me
the "you're not getting
any younger" speech,

1026
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:29,186
and I just blurted it out.

1027
01:05:31,536 --> 01:05:34,800
Well, I guess
congratulations is in order.

1028
01:05:34,843 --> 01:05:37,020
When's the big date?

1029
01:05:37,063 --> 01:05:39,631
I promise you
it won't go that far.

1030
01:05:41,111 --> 01:05:43,200
I've been trying to think ahead for a change.

1031
01:05:43,243 --> 01:05:45,767
What do you think about this--

1032
01:05:45,811 --> 01:05:49,206
Next week I'll announce that
you have to go to a medical
convention in San Francisco.

1033
01:05:49,249 --> 01:05:51,208
While there, you'll meet
an old girlfriend...

1034
01:05:51,251 --> 01:05:53,253
who's now an OB-GYN
at the Mayo Clinic.

1035
01:05:53,297 --> 01:05:55,603
You'll come back.
We'll fight.

1036
01:05:55,647 --> 01:05:58,650
You'll move to Minnesota,
send me a "dear Jane" letter,

1037
01:05:58,693 --> 01:06:03,350
and that'll be the end
of David Steinberg.-

1038
01:06:03,394 --> 01:06:06,353
So fade out
on Sarah and David,

1039
01:06:06,397 --> 01:06:08,921
but what about
Sarah and Bob?

1040
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,141
We can keep
seeing each other.

1041
01:06:11,184 --> 01:06:13,447
I mean, do you want to?Very much.

1042
01:06:14,535 --> 01:06:16,711
So do I.

1043
01:06:16,755 --> 01:06:19,801
But we can't
tell your parents?

1044
01:06:19,845 --> 01:06:23,675
Not right away. Okay?So we're right back
to the beginning,

1045
01:06:23,718 --> 01:06:26,025
only this time
with a shift in casting,

1046
01:06:26,069 --> 01:06:28,245
and I'm the odd man out.

1047
01:06:28,288 --> 01:06:30,247
I don't think I like
that arrangement.

1048
01:06:31,944 --> 01:06:34,512
Just give me some time,
okay?

1049
01:06:38,907 --> 01:06:41,084
Aren't you gonna
get that?Let the machine answer it.

1050
01:06:41,127 --> 01:06:44,739
What if it's your mother?Then definitely
let the machine answer it.

1051
01:06:44,783 --> 01:06:48,047
Hi. It's Sarah. Please leave a message.

1052
01:06:48,091 --> 01:06:50,049
Sarah, are you there?

1053
01:06:51,616 --> 01:06:55,663
Look, 
I don't want to be a pest.

1054
01:06:55,707 --> 01:06:58,057
I know you're going
through a difficult
time right now,

1055
01:06:58,101 --> 01:07:00,668
and, I want you
to know that,

1056
01:07:00,712 --> 01:07:03,845
I love you,
and,

1057
01:07:03,889 --> 01:07:07,110
you know, I'm-I'm here.

1058
01:07:07,153 --> 01:07:10,722
I wish we could keep
seeing each other. -

1059
01:07:10,765 --> 01:07:13,029
So, anyway--

1060
01:07:15,814 --> 01:07:18,991
I'm here, and,

1061
01:07:20,253 --> 01:07:22,168
I love you.

1062
01:07:23,474 --> 01:07:25,432
Okay, bye.

1063
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:32,352
You didn't tell him
about us?

1064
01:07:34,006 --> 01:07:36,008
No.

1065
01:07:38,315 --> 01:07:41,796
I didn't want him to think
that I broke up with him
because of you.

1066
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,408
- I don't want to hurt him.
- Sarah, by the time
this whole thing ends,

1067
01:07:44,451 --> 01:07:46,845
somebody's gonna get hurt.

1068
01:07:46,888 --> 01:07:50,283
I'm sorry I got you
into this.

1069
01:07:50,327 --> 01:07:52,372
I'm not.

1070
01:07:52,416 --> 01:07:55,723
Look, why don't we
introduce me--

1071
01:07:55,767 --> 01:07:58,335
the real me--
to your family?

1072
01:07:58,378 --> 01:08:02,948
I wish we could,
but this monster
I've created--

1073
01:08:02,991 --> 01:08:05,429
I don't know how
to get around it. All right, look.

1074
01:08:05,472 --> 01:08:07,213
The problems you have
with Chris--

1075
01:08:07,257 --> 01:08:10,173
Is exactly the same problem
I have with you.

1076
01:08:13,785 --> 01:08:19,138
Sarah, in my own quiet way,

1077
01:08:19,182 --> 01:08:21,184
I've been falling
in love with you.

1078
01:08:21,227 --> 01:08:23,142
You know that.

1079
01:08:24,274 --> 01:08:26,493
Yes.

1080
01:08:26,537 --> 01:08:28,495
All right. Okay.

1081
01:08:30,758 --> 01:08:32,717
Well, look, then. Okay?

1082
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:36,155
I've been doing some thinking.What are you thinking?

1083
01:08:36,199 --> 01:08:39,941
Well, your family's
crazy about me, you know.

1084
01:08:39,985 --> 01:08:42,640
They're crazy
about Dr. Steinberg.

1085
01:08:42,683 --> 01:08:44,642
What's in a name?

1086
01:08:44,685 --> 01:08:46,861
What's in a name?

1087
01:08:46,905 --> 01:08:49,690
Let's not forget
what happened
to Romeo and Juliet.

1088
01:08:49,734 --> 01:08:52,302
Romeo and Juliet
concealed their love.

1089
01:08:52,345 --> 01:08:55,087
That was there mistake.
Let's not do that.

1090
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:58,134
I just need
a little time, okay?

1091
01:08:58,177 --> 01:09:01,049
Over time I can break
the whole thing
to them gently.

1092
01:09:01,093 --> 01:09:03,051
How about that?

1093
01:09:03,095 --> 01:09:05,924
Well, look--

1094
01:09:05,967 --> 01:09:09,275
I don't want this
to sound like a threat
or an ultimatum or anything,

1095
01:09:09,319 --> 01:09:13,453
but... I'm not gonna do that.

1096
01:09:16,108 --> 01:09:17,849
That sounds like
a threat and an ultimatum.

1097
01:09:17,892 --> 01:09:20,025
All right, I suppose it is.

1098
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:24,856
What do you want me to do?Sarah--

1099
01:09:26,684 --> 01:09:30,253
Write this in ink.
Chisel it in stone.
Embroider it in a doily.

1100
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:35,127
There's the truth,
and then there's
everything else.

1101
01:09:44,528 --> 01:09:46,225
I don't know.

1102
01:09:50,969 --> 01:09:52,884
Well--

1103
01:09:57,758 --> 01:10:01,588
An actor should
never give up the chance
to play a role,

1104
01:10:01,632 --> 01:10:03,547
but,

1105
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:08,856
I'm through
with playing Dr. Steinberg.

1106
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:11,076
Bob?Yeah--

1107
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:14,253
That's my name.
Robert Schroeder.

1108
01:10:14,297 --> 01:10:17,517
If you ever want
to introduce your family
to Robert Schroeder,

1109
01:10:17,561 --> 01:10:19,302
give me a call.

1110
01:10:29,137 --> 01:10:32,489
Bob--

1111
01:10:32,532 --> 01:10:35,318
Bob? No, no, no.

1112
01:10:35,361 --> 01:10:38,930
No, my parents are coming over.
They wanna take us out
for a nice dinner.

1113
01:10:38,973 --> 01:10:41,149
You-You don't
wanna miss that, do you?

1114
01:10:41,193 --> 01:10:43,151
You gonna tell 'em
about us?Yes! Yes.

1115
01:10:43,195 --> 01:10:45,153
Eventually I will.

1116
01:10:45,197 --> 01:10:47,286
Sarah--Bob,

1117
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:51,464
I have messed up
everything else in my life.

1118
01:10:51,508 --> 01:10:54,032
I don't want
to mess this up.

1119
01:10:54,075 --> 01:10:56,295
You have become
a part of my life.

1120
01:10:56,339 --> 01:10:59,559
You are already
a part of my family.

1121
01:10:59,603 --> 01:11:01,648
I don't want to lose that.

1122
01:11:01,692 --> 01:11:04,521
Then tell them about us.

1123
01:11:04,564 --> 01:11:08,568
I don't want to hurt them.You don't want to hurt them?

1124
01:11:08,612 --> 01:11:10,962
You don't want to hurt Chris.
You don't want to hurt me.

1125
01:11:12,572 --> 01:11:14,574
All you're doing
is hurting yourself.

1126
01:11:24,018 --> 01:11:28,632
A man has
got to stake his claim.
It's what he's gotta do.

1127
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:34,115
Well, maybe he had a medical emergency.

1128
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:36,117
No, I used that one already.

1129
01:11:36,161 --> 01:11:39,120
Maybe he had to go
to San Francisco.

1130
01:11:39,164 --> 01:11:41,122
No, I'm gonna have
to use that one later.

1131
01:11:41,166 --> 01:11:43,037
Besides, why didn't I tell them
he went to San Francisco...

1132
01:11:43,081 --> 01:11:45,301
if he already
went to San Francisco?

1133
01:11:45,344 --> 01:11:47,477
Maybe he had
a medical emergency
inSan Francisco.

1134
01:11:50,393 --> 01:11:53,309
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

1135
01:11:53,352 --> 01:11:56,007
- Sarah.
- Joel. What's going on?

1136
01:11:56,050 --> 01:11:58,357
Mom called.
She says you're engaged.

1137
01:11:58,401 --> 01:12:00,751
Yup.

1138
01:12:00,794 --> 01:12:03,754
It's official.
You're gaining a brother.

1139
01:12:03,797 --> 01:12:06,234
You, wanna tell me
what's going on?

1140
01:12:06,278 --> 01:12:08,280
What do you mean?

1141
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:12,023
Well, I called
Northwestern Memorial.

1142
01:12:12,066 --> 01:12:15,287
I spoke to Dr. David Steinberg.

1143
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,507
Yeah.

1144
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:21,902
Only he's 80 years old,
and in orthopedics.

1145
01:12:21,946 --> 01:12:24,252
So what's going on?

1146
01:12:28,866 --> 01:12:30,824
Do you remember Chris?

1147
01:12:31,912 --> 01:12:33,610
Chris? Yeah.

1148
01:12:33,653 --> 01:12:38,615
I told everyone
that I stopped seeing him,
but I didn't.

1149
01:12:38,658 --> 01:12:41,095
I didn't stop seeing him.

1150
01:12:41,139 --> 01:12:44,316
I invented Dr. David Steinberg
to tell Mother about...

1151
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,753
so she would quit trying
to fix me up all the time.

1152
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:49,974
Dave--

1153
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:53,586
Bob--

1154
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:56,110
Bob is an actor...

1155
01:12:56,154 --> 01:12:58,678
I hired to play the part
for you all.

1156
01:12:58,722 --> 01:13:01,899
So you made
all of this up...

1157
01:13:01,942 --> 01:13:06,425
because you didn't like
the guys that Mom was trying
to fix you up with?

1158
01:13:06,469 --> 01:13:08,427
She wanted to see me
with the perfect boyfriend.

1159
01:13:08,471 --> 01:13:10,429
I gave her
the perfect boyfriend.

1160
01:13:10,473 --> 01:13:13,389
And you're still
seeing Chris?

1161
01:13:13,432 --> 01:13:16,392
Well, no, actually.
Not anymore.

1162
01:13:16,435 --> 01:13:19,264
So how long is this...

1163
01:13:19,307 --> 01:13:22,920
Bob thing going to go on?

1164
01:13:22,963 --> 01:13:26,140
Well, now it gets
kind of complicated.

1165
01:13:26,184 --> 01:13:28,926
Now
it gets complicated.

1166
01:13:28,969 --> 01:13:31,363
Just let me handle it,
all right?

1167
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:33,452
You're gonna handle it?
How are you gonna
handle it?

1168
01:13:33,496 --> 01:13:35,715
I'm-- I'm working on it.

1169
01:13:35,759 --> 01:13:39,502
I don't suppose honesty
has occurred to you
as an option, has it?

1170
01:13:39,545 --> 01:13:42,026
Well, I can't tell them
about Bob now,

1171
01:13:42,069 --> 01:13:44,376
any more than I could tell them
about Chris.

1172
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:46,639
Well, I don't see how--Bob isn't Jewish either.

1173
01:13:46,683 --> 01:13:48,859
He's not Jewish?

1174
01:13:48,902 --> 01:13:51,252
Not officially, no.

1175
01:13:51,296 --> 01:13:53,472
Well, no wonder
I was confused.

1176
01:13:53,516 --> 01:13:56,475
I knew there was something phony
about "Dr. Steinberg."

1177
01:13:56,519 --> 01:14:01,219
It just never occurred to me
that everything was phony
about Dr. Steinberg.

1178
01:14:01,262 --> 01:14:03,221
If Mom and Dad weren't
so bent out of shape...

1179
01:14:03,264 --> 01:14:05,876
about me dating someone
who isn't Jewish,

1180
01:14:05,919 --> 01:14:08,052
none of this
would have happened.

1181
01:14:08,095 --> 01:14:11,055
Sarah, there are other
issues here besides...

1182
01:14:11,098 --> 01:14:13,318
who you decide to date.

1183
01:14:13,361 --> 01:14:16,887
Please, don't-don't do that.
Don't be a therapist.

1184
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:19,716
- Do not start psychoanalyzing.
- I'm not psychoanalyzing.

1185
01:14:19,759 --> 01:14:22,632
I-I will support you 100%.

1186
01:14:22,675 --> 01:14:26,200
Just tell me what it is that you want me to support.

1187
01:14:26,244 --> 01:14:29,508
Now, what is it that
you want the most right now?

1188
01:14:31,641 --> 01:14:35,035
I-I-- I wanna be with Bob.

1189
01:14:35,079 --> 01:14:37,081
Okay.

1190
01:14:38,386 --> 01:14:40,911
I have your permission now?
Thank you very much.

1191
01:14:40,954 --> 01:14:42,913
Why do you need someone's permission?

1192
01:14:42,956 --> 01:14:44,915
Because that's the way
I was raised, okay?

1193
01:14:44,958 --> 01:14:47,178
We always have to be nice.
Everything has to be nice.

1194
01:14:47,221 --> 01:14:48,919
God forbid somebody's feelings
should be hurt.

1195
01:14:48,962 --> 01:14:51,356
What about your feelings?

1196
01:14:51,399 --> 01:14:53,445
I have no time
to consider my feelings.

1197
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:56,187
I spend my whole life worrying about their feelings.

1198
01:14:56,230 --> 01:14:58,885
- I just wanna live
my own life.
- So who's stopping you?

1199
01:14:58,929 --> 01:15:00,583
They are! They are?

1200
01:15:00,626 --> 01:15:03,020
- Yes.
- Let me say one thing
about that.

1201
01:15:03,063 --> 01:15:05,805
- Baloney!
- I don't need this right now.

1202
01:15:05,849 --> 01:15:08,286
Look, Mom and Dad
are Mom and Dad.

1203
01:15:08,329 --> 01:15:10,767
They're your parents.
They're not gonna change.

1204
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:13,334
If you want your
relationship with them
to be different,

1205
01:15:13,378 --> 01:15:15,206
you have to change it.But they won't let me.

1206
01:15:15,249 --> 01:15:17,251
Well, then
it's all their fault,

1207
01:15:17,295 --> 01:15:19,253
and you can blame them
for all your problems.

1208
01:15:19,297 --> 01:15:21,908
Every day clients
are sitting in my office,

1209
01:15:21,952 --> 01:15:24,737
going on and on
about how their parents...

1210
01:15:24,781 --> 01:15:26,652
have screwed up
their whole lives.Well, what do you say to them?

1211
01:15:26,696 --> 01:15:29,350
Get over it!

1212
01:15:29,394 --> 01:15:32,179
They're here.

1213
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:35,443
- Are you gonna tell them?
- Don't you tell them.

1214
01:15:35,487 --> 01:15:37,968
I'm not gonna tell them.
Are you gonna tell them?

1215
01:15:38,011 --> 01:15:40,579
I swear, Joel.
Don't you say anything.

1216
01:15:40,623 --> 01:15:43,060
I'm not gonna say anything.
Open the door.

1217
01:15:49,632 --> 01:15:52,025
Sarah. Mazel tov!

1218
01:15:53,113 --> 01:15:55,376
Joel, you're here.

1219
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:57,117
Apparently.

1220
01:15:59,903 --> 01:16:02,862
- You coming for dinner?
- We'll see how it goes.

1221
01:16:02,906 --> 01:16:05,735
Sarah, we have
so much to talk about.

1222
01:16:05,778 --> 01:16:08,085
Have you decided
on a date?

1223
01:16:08,128 --> 01:16:11,610
Where do you want the wedding?
Whatever you want.
You decide.

1224
01:16:11,654 --> 01:16:14,482
Oy. This is gonna cost me.

1225
01:16:14,526 --> 01:16:17,398
Maybe not so much.

1226
01:16:17,442 --> 01:16:20,532
We have to get a hall,
and we have to call
a caterer.

1227
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:23,448
You know, I wanna
find out who catered
the Silverman wedding,

1228
01:16:23,491 --> 01:16:25,798
because him
I wouldn't call.

1229
01:16:25,842 --> 01:16:27,887
Just a second.

1230
01:16:32,544 --> 01:16:35,416
I liked it when you said
I was part of your family.

1231
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:38,115
Thank you.

1232
01:16:47,254 --> 01:16:49,779
Welcome to the family.Thank you, Mr. Goldman.

1233
01:16:49,822 --> 01:16:52,651
David, come here.

1234
01:16:52,695 --> 01:16:55,045
Mazel tov!Thank you.

1235
01:16:56,176 --> 01:16:58,352
Mom--
Dad,

1236
01:17:00,354 --> 01:17:03,575
there's something
I have to tell you.I know. We have so much to plan.

1237
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:05,359
No, there's something
else that we have
to talk about first.

1238
01:17:05,403 --> 01:17:08,798
Well, talk.
Have you two decided
on a date?

1239
01:17:08,841 --> 01:17:12,410
No. No.
There's something
that you have to know.

1240
01:17:12,453 --> 01:17:15,152
What is it?
Whatever you want, we'll do.

1241
01:17:15,195 --> 01:17:17,676
No, I'm not--
I'm not talking
about the wedding.

1242
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:21,027
What are you talking about?
What else is there to talk
about besides the wedding?

1243
01:17:21,071 --> 01:17:23,551
Will you let me talk,
and I'll tell you?Excuse me.

1244
01:17:26,076 --> 01:17:28,774
I know-- I know
you're not gonna
be happy about this.

1245
01:17:28,818 --> 01:17:31,255
Well, what is it?

1246
01:17:31,298 --> 01:17:32,952
The truth of the matter
is that--

1247
01:17:39,263 --> 01:17:42,440
- David has to go to a medical
convention in San Francisco.
- Sarah.

1248
01:17:42,483 --> 01:17:45,356
- Sarah!
- It's not worth it. Let's
just do what we're gonna do.

1249
01:17:45,399 --> 01:17:47,488
What are you gonna do?We're getting married.

1250
01:17:47,532 --> 01:17:49,752
- You're not getting married.
- You're not getting married?

1251
01:17:49,795 --> 01:17:52,232
We're not getting married the way you think we're getting married.

1252
01:17:52,276 --> 01:17:54,452
How many ways are there
to get married?

1253
01:17:54,495 --> 01:17:57,890
We'll get married whatever way
you want us to get married.

1254
01:17:57,934 --> 01:18:01,198
What are you talking about?That's what I was trying
to tell you before.

1255
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,854
Abe, what are they
talking about?I don't know.

1256
01:18:04,897 --> 01:18:06,856
What areyou talking about?

1257
01:18:06,899 --> 01:18:08,945
Now what?

1258
01:18:08,988 --> 01:18:11,077
What, you invited
somebody else?No.

1259
01:18:11,121 --> 01:18:12,992
I don't know!

1260
01:18:14,907 --> 01:18:17,214
Sarah, may I speak to you
for a second, please?

1261
01:18:18,563 --> 01:18:20,739
Th-This is not a good time.

1262
01:18:20,783 --> 01:18:22,915
I promise I will call you
tomorrow.No.

1263
01:18:22,959 --> 01:18:25,744
You know what?
I cannot put this off
any longer.

1264
01:18:29,792 --> 01:18:32,055
Forgive me
for barging in.

1265
01:18:34,318 --> 01:18:38,496
Perhaps it's...
good that you're
all here anyway.

1266
01:18:38,539 --> 01:18:42,761
Sarah, there comes a time
when a man needs
to stake his claim.

1267
01:18:42,805 --> 01:18:44,850
Mr. Goldman, Mrs. Goldman,

1268
01:18:44,894 --> 01:18:46,852
I'm fully cognizant
of the fact...

1269
01:18:46,896 --> 01:18:49,420
that you don't
approve of me,

1270
01:18:49,463 --> 01:18:52,771
but I think if you got
to know me better,

1271
01:18:52,815 --> 01:18:55,643
you'd discover that in spite
of the fact that I work
in advertising,

1272
01:18:55,687 --> 01:18:58,734
I'm a very decent human being,
and I love your daughter
very much.

1273
01:18:58,777 --> 01:19:00,997
And while it might be
a source of conflict
for her,

1274
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:03,695
I believe
she also loves me.

1275
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:06,524
I wanna dedicate my life
to making her happy,

1276
01:19:06,567 --> 01:19:10,310
and to provide for her
in every way that
I possibly can.

1277
01:19:10,354 --> 01:19:12,922
So with your permission,
hopefully your blessing,

1278
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,970
I would like to
ask your daughter
for her hand in marriage.

1279
01:19:20,581 --> 01:19:22,714
Who is this?

1280
01:19:23,802 --> 01:19:26,109
You remember Chris?Chris?

1281
01:19:28,241 --> 01:19:31,027
The man that I was seeing,
who I told you I wasn't
seeing anymore.

1282
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,987
Santa Claus.

1283
01:19:35,031 --> 01:19:37,250
It's an unfortunate
sobriquet,

1284
01:19:37,294 --> 01:19:39,731
but I will not
let it dissuade me
from my purpose.

1285
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,820
You didn't like him
because he isn't Jewish.

1286
01:19:41,864 --> 01:19:43,822
Chris, I-- No.

1287
01:19:43,866 --> 01:19:46,216
I didn't not like him
because he wasn't Jewish.

1288
01:19:46,259 --> 01:19:49,654
I didn't like him
because he reminded me
of my cousin Norman.

1289
01:19:49,697 --> 01:19:52,222
- Him I never liked.
- Sarah?

1290
01:19:52,265 --> 01:19:54,267
Will you marry me? Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1291
01:19:54,311 --> 01:19:56,356
Wait a minute.
Excuse me. Sorry. Please.

1292
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,489
You know, we're all
very moved by your efforts here,

1293
01:19:58,532 --> 01:20:01,318
but we're here to discuss
wedding plans for
Sarah and me.

1294
01:20:01,361 --> 01:20:03,973
I just haven't done
my part.

1295
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:08,804
Sarah, when it's right,
you know it.

1296
01:20:12,459 --> 01:20:14,200
Will you please marry me?

1297
01:20:15,854 --> 01:20:18,335
What?He already
asked her.

1298
01:20:18,378 --> 01:20:20,859
Didn't you already ask her?

1299
01:20:20,903 --> 01:20:23,427
Abe, jump in.

1300
01:20:23,470 --> 01:20:26,996
Is this your boyfriend,
or is this your boyfriend?

1301
01:20:27,039 --> 01:20:29,259
Well, that is yet
to be determined, sir.

1302
01:20:29,302 --> 01:20:32,349
Sarah, you have two offers
on the table.

1303
01:20:32,392 --> 01:20:36,266
- She's marrying David.
- I'm not marrying David.

1304
01:20:36,309 --> 01:20:38,746
What, he's not
good enough for you? No.

1305
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:41,532
I mean yes. He's good enough.

1306
01:20:41,575 --> 01:20:44,883
- Well, then, it's settled.
- It's not settled.
Nothing is settled.

1307
01:20:46,624 --> 01:20:49,453
All right, look.

1308
01:20:49,496 --> 01:20:53,849
Th-This isn't easy to explain,
so just bear with me on this.

1309
01:20:53,892 --> 01:20:57,026
Mom, Dad,
this whole thing...

1310
01:20:57,069 --> 01:20:59,376
is because I care
about how you two feel.

1311
01:20:59,419 --> 01:21:01,987
What are you talking about?
What thing?

1312
01:21:02,031 --> 01:21:04,990
This thing.
This whole thing here.

1313
01:21:05,034 --> 01:21:08,341
Abe, what is this thing?How do I know?

1314
01:21:08,385 --> 01:21:11,127
It's her thing.
What is this thing?

1315
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:15,914
This is--
This is Bob Schroeder.

1316
01:21:18,438 --> 01:21:22,181
After I told you
that I had stopped
seeing Chris,

1317
01:21:22,225 --> 01:21:24,183
I kept on seeing him,

1318
01:21:24,227 --> 01:21:27,447
and made up David...

1319
01:21:27,491 --> 01:21:29,841
to be my boyfriend.

1320
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:32,191
Made up?
What do you mean,
made up?

1321
01:21:32,235 --> 01:21:34,933
I mean he doesn't exist.

1322
01:21:34,977 --> 01:21:37,936
There is no Dr. David Steinberg.

1323
01:21:40,286 --> 01:21:42,767
I made him up
because I wanted you to think...

1324
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:45,813
that I had a boyfriend
that you would be happy about.

1325
01:21:45,857 --> 01:21:48,512
I--

1326
01:21:48,555 --> 01:21:51,297
I hired Bob...

1327
01:21:51,341 --> 01:21:53,691
to portray David--

1328
01:21:53,734 --> 01:21:57,042
To portray the boyfriend
you thought I had.

1329
01:21:57,086 --> 01:21:59,697
Portray? Like an actor?

1330
01:22:00,959 --> 01:22:04,702
Exactly like an... actor.

1331
01:22:04,745 --> 01:22:06,922
Sarah,

1332
01:22:08,836 --> 01:22:10,621
how can you do
such a thing?

1333
01:22:10,664 --> 01:22:12,971
I'm sorry.

1334
01:22:13,015 --> 01:22:15,191
I didn't want to hurt you.

1335
01:22:15,234 --> 01:22:19,499
So you make up a story? You lie?
You don't lie to your parents.

1336
01:22:19,543 --> 01:22:22,894
- I did it to make you happy.
- Lying makes us happy?

1337
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:25,114
Well, you didn't seem crazy
about the truth.

1338
01:22:25,157 --> 01:22:28,334
You want me to be happy, but
I'm only supposed to be happy
with what makes you happy.

1339
01:22:28,378 --> 01:22:30,815
I have to live
my own life.

1340
01:22:30,858 --> 01:22:34,427
So whose life are you
living, Sarah, mine?

1341
01:22:34,471 --> 01:22:38,040
Yes, in a way.Don't do me any favors.

1342
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:42,000
Mr. Goldman, please.
I'm partially responsible
for what's going on here.

1343
01:22:42,044 --> 01:22:45,699
So I'm not really a doctor,
and I'm not really Jewish.

1344
01:22:45,743 --> 01:22:48,398
You're not Jewish?

1345
01:22:48,441 --> 01:22:50,530
Abe, it's another lie.

1346
01:22:50,574 --> 01:22:52,793
Miriam, let's go.

1347
01:22:52,837 --> 01:22:55,100
Mrs. Goldman, please.

1348
01:22:55,144 --> 01:22:58,451
From Sarah and me,
you and Mr. Goldman
will have Jewish grandchildren,

1349
01:22:58,495 --> 01:23:00,453
not just because
the mother's Jewish.

1350
01:23:00,497 --> 01:23:04,022
I'm prepared to convert.Me too.

1351
01:23:04,066 --> 01:23:06,677
I was gonna
say that earlier.We'll talk about it later.

1352
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:09,375
It's all right.
You live your own life.

1353
01:23:09,419 --> 01:23:11,508
You work out
your own problems.

1354
01:23:11,551 --> 01:23:13,858
But if you'd listened to your mother and me,

1355
01:23:13,901 --> 01:23:15,773
you wouldn't have
these problems.

1356
01:23:15,816 --> 01:23:18,428
Dad, you're not helping
the situation. I'm helping.

1357
01:23:18,471 --> 01:23:21,822
Leaving is helping. Mr. Goldman, please.

1358
01:23:21,866 --> 01:23:24,216
I don't stay anywhere
I don't wanna stay.

1359
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:26,740
- Will you just talk to me?
- You don't lie
to your parents.

1360
01:23:26,784 --> 01:23:29,917
I'm sorry.You wanna know
about lying?

1361
01:23:32,442 --> 01:23:35,053
You lie to the guy
who says you can't
come into this country...

1362
01:23:35,097 --> 01:23:38,056
because you don't
have a sponsor.

1363
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:41,190
You lie to the man
who says you can't go
to his school...

1364
01:23:41,233 --> 01:23:43,453
because your name
sounds funny.

1365
01:23:43,496 --> 01:23:45,846
And you lie to the kid
that comes into your store,

1366
01:23:45,890 --> 01:23:49,720
puts a gun to your head
and threatens to take
your life away.

1367
01:23:49,763 --> 01:23:54,116
But, baby, you never,
never, ever lie to your parents.

1368
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:57,032
- Abe.
- Daddy.

1369
01:23:57,075 --> 01:24:00,035
- I'm not staying.
- Dad!

1370
01:24:00,078 --> 01:24:01,471
Abe.Daddy!

1371
01:24:01,514 --> 01:24:03,603
Abe.Dad!

1372
01:24:03,647 --> 01:24:04,952
You all right?Dad?

1373
01:24:04,996 --> 01:24:07,564
I'm all right.
It's-It's nothing.Shh, shh, shh.

1374
01:24:07,607 --> 01:24:10,219
Mom?Call 911.

1375
01:24:10,262 --> 01:24:12,743
No, don't call 911.Yes, Sarah,
call 911 now.

1376
01:24:12,786 --> 01:24:14,745
No, don't.
I'm all right.
It's nothing.

1377
01:24:14,788 --> 01:24:17,356
Joel, loosen his collar.What are we
supposed to do?

1378
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:20,098
You couldn't be
a real doctor now,
could you?

1379
01:24:20,142 --> 01:24:22,100
You're more doctor
than I am.I'm a therapist.

1380
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:24,189
Do you want me to
ask him how he feels
about being sick?

1381
01:24:24,233 --> 01:24:27,149
- They're on their way.
- Don't call 911.

1382
01:24:27,192 --> 01:24:29,586
Just get him some water.I'll be all right.

1383
01:24:29,629 --> 01:24:31,588
What else can we do?Water.

1384
01:24:31,631 --> 01:24:34,678
Pop, is there anything else
we can do for you?

1385
01:24:34,721 --> 01:24:36,810
Maybe you could all
crowd in a little more,

1386
01:24:36,854 --> 01:24:39,335
so I don't get
too much air.

1387
01:25:05,187 --> 01:25:07,450
What did the doctor say?

1388
01:25:07,493 --> 01:25:09,713
They want Dad
to take it easy.

1389
01:25:09,756 --> 01:25:11,715
I'll believe that
when I see it.

1390
01:25:11,758 --> 01:25:13,282
Is your father
gonna be all right?

1391
01:25:13,325 --> 01:25:15,675
All things considered,
it could be a lot worse.

1392
01:25:15,719 --> 01:25:17,808
They were able
to rule out an M.I.

1393
01:25:17,851 --> 01:25:21,333
- A what?
- Myocardial infarction.

1394
01:25:23,379 --> 01:25:25,816
What's that?Come on, man.

1395
01:25:25,859 --> 01:25:29,167
I gave up
my medical practice.It's a heart attack.

1396
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:33,737
Um, they're gonna
release him.

1397
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:35,739
So I'm gonna take
Mom and Dad home,

1398
01:25:35,782 --> 01:25:38,002
and I'll call you later.

1399
01:25:39,090 --> 01:25:41,353
I wanna talk to him.

1400
01:25:41,397 --> 01:25:45,531
I don't think he wants
to talk to you
right now.

1401
01:25:45,575 --> 01:25:47,794
All the more reason.

1402
01:25:47,838 --> 01:25:51,146
I'll go see if he's ready.

1403
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:00,503
I'm so afraid
of losing them.

1404
01:26:01,852 --> 01:26:04,202
Sarah, your dad's
gonna be okay.

1405
01:26:04,246 --> 01:26:06,770
I look at my parents,
and all I see are parents.

1406
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:13,559
I've never seen them
as two individuals,

1407
01:26:13,603 --> 01:26:16,954
as two people who I love
and I care for...

1408
01:26:16,997 --> 01:26:18,912
so much.

1409
01:26:21,828 --> 01:26:23,569
Sarah?

1410
01:26:23,613 --> 01:26:25,571
Mom.

1411
01:26:30,010 --> 01:26:32,448
Are you all right?Yeah. I'm all right.

1412
01:26:33,449 --> 01:26:35,451
I'm all right.

1413
01:26:42,284 --> 01:26:45,243
Sarah,

1414
01:26:45,287 --> 01:26:47,941
whatever we did
to make you so unhappy,

1415
01:26:49,378 --> 01:26:51,380
we apologize.

1416
01:26:52,729 --> 01:26:54,774
You don't have
to apologize.

1417
01:26:54,818 --> 01:26:57,037
I want you to treat me
like an adult,

1418
01:26:57,081 --> 01:26:59,736
but I haven't
been acting like one.

1419
01:26:59,779 --> 01:27:02,260
Whatever you want to do,

1420
01:27:02,304 --> 01:27:05,002
you do, okay?You know what
I'd like to do?

1421
01:27:05,045 --> 01:27:07,439
What?I'd like for us
to get to know each other.

1422
01:27:07,483 --> 01:27:10,747
We don't know each other?
We talk on the phone
every day.

1423
01:27:10,790 --> 01:27:13,576
We talk every day,
but what do we talk about?

1424
01:27:13,619 --> 01:27:16,274
We talk like a mother
and a child.

1425
01:27:16,318 --> 01:27:19,843
Mom, I wanna know
about your life.

1426
01:27:19,886 --> 01:27:22,715
And, Mom, there are things
I could tell you
about my life...

1427
01:27:22,759 --> 01:27:24,891
that you would not believe.

1428
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,202
How about having lunch
with me tomorrow?

1429
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:34,249
I can't tomorrow.

1430
01:27:34,292 --> 01:27:36,294
I have to go
to the cemetery.

1431
01:27:36,338 --> 01:27:38,209
It's yartzeitfor Papa.

1432
01:27:41,734 --> 01:27:44,171
May I go with you?No, you don't wanna go.

1433
01:27:44,215 --> 01:27:46,739
You don't wanna go.Yes, Mom.

1434
01:27:46,783 --> 01:27:49,960
I would.
I would like to go.

1435
01:27:57,054 --> 01:27:59,883
Dad, I need to talk to you.

1436
01:27:59,926 --> 01:28:03,016
Abe, she needs to talk to you.

1437
01:28:05,802 --> 01:28:07,804
What do you want
to talk about?

1438
01:28:12,983 --> 01:28:14,985
Dad, I love you.

1439
01:28:17,161 --> 01:28:20,556
Sometimes I've been so afraid
of losing your love,

1440
01:28:20,599 --> 01:28:22,906
that I've acted stupidly...

1441
01:28:22,949 --> 01:28:25,169
and thoughtlessly,

1442
01:28:25,212 --> 01:28:28,346
and I didn't treat your love with the respect that it deserves.

1443
01:28:30,653 --> 01:28:34,134
You know, I sat here
all night, thinking--

1444
01:28:34,178 --> 01:28:37,964
Thinking to myself,
"What is the best way--

1445
01:28:38,008 --> 01:28:40,532
What is the best way
to express my love for you?"

1446
01:28:45,189 --> 01:28:47,104
From now on,

1447
01:28:49,802 --> 01:28:51,848
I wanna be honest with you,

1448
01:28:53,197 --> 01:28:55,286
and I want you
to be honest with me.

1449
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:57,332
I'm honest.

1450
01:28:57,375 --> 01:28:59,029
Not always.

1451
01:29:00,987 --> 01:29:03,512
You didn't tell me
about your being held up.

1452
01:29:03,555 --> 01:29:05,862
We didn't want to worry you.

1453
01:29:05,905 --> 01:29:09,735
Exactly. Exactly.

1454
01:29:09,779 --> 01:29:13,565
We're always so worried
about having someone
worry about us.

1455
01:29:13,609 --> 01:29:16,655
You can trust me,
all right?

1456
01:29:16,699 --> 01:29:19,354
Let me decide whether or not
I should worry,

1457
01:29:19,397 --> 01:29:21,443
and I promise--

1458
01:29:21,486 --> 01:29:25,185
I promise, Dad,

1459
01:29:25,229 --> 01:29:28,319
that I will let you know
what is going on in my life.

1460
01:29:36,675 --> 01:29:39,330
What isgoing on
in your life?

1461
01:29:46,555 --> 01:29:48,557
Excuse me.

1462
01:29:49,514 --> 01:29:52,299
Chris--

1463
01:29:56,303 --> 01:30:00,612
Chris, you are
the kindest,

1464
01:30:00,656 --> 01:30:04,007
sweetest man
I have ever known.

1465
01:30:05,008 --> 01:30:07,619
You have given me
more support...

1466
01:30:07,663 --> 01:30:11,362
and understanding
than I deserve,

1467
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:13,886
and I will always
love you for that.

1468
01:30:15,975 --> 01:30:17,803
But I'm not
gonna marry you.

1469
01:30:20,371 --> 01:30:23,026
I see.

1470
01:30:24,810 --> 01:30:26,812
Well, I'm gonna--

1471
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:31,295
My stuff--

1472
01:30:33,993 --> 01:30:36,343
Mrs. Goldman.

1473
01:30:36,387 --> 01:30:40,609
Mr. Goldman. Joel.

1474
01:30:40,652 --> 01:30:43,394
You be good to her.Count on it.

1475
01:30:44,787 --> 01:30:46,658
Thank you.

1476
01:30:49,922 --> 01:30:51,924
Sarah.

1477
01:30:54,666 --> 01:30:56,538
Bob?

1478
01:30:59,932 --> 01:31:02,326
I'm not gonna
marry you either.

1479
01:31:02,369 --> 01:31:04,502
Okay.

1480
01:31:04,546 --> 01:31:06,852
Not right now.

1481
01:31:08,245 --> 01:31:10,465
Okay.

1482
01:31:10,508 --> 01:31:12,858
I don't know why
you came into my life
at this particular time.

1483
01:31:12,902 --> 01:31:15,034
You called.

1484
01:31:18,908 --> 01:31:21,650
I'm really glad I did.Me too.

1485
01:31:24,783 --> 01:31:28,700
And I would like you to be
my official and...

1486
01:31:30,441 --> 01:31:33,488
very conspicuous boyfriend.

1487
01:31:33,531 --> 01:31:35,359
I can do that.

1488
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:46,892
Mom, Dad, Joel--

1489
01:31:46,936 --> 01:31:50,548
I'd like you
to meet my boyfriend.

1490
01:31:50,592 --> 01:31:54,204
This is Bob Schroeder.Hi.

1491
01:31:54,247 --> 01:31:59,252
- Schroeder?
- It's not. I checked.

1492
01:31:59,296 --> 01:32:01,907
Well,

1493
01:32:01,951 --> 01:32:03,996
if you'll excuse me,
I'll get going.

1494
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:06,129
- Abe?
- David?

1495
01:32:06,172 --> 01:32:08,610
- Bob.
- Whatever.

1496
01:32:10,263 --> 01:32:13,223
- From acting
you make a living?
- Sometimes.

1497
01:32:14,572 --> 01:32:16,705
Oy.

1498
01:32:16,748 --> 01:32:19,969
- Are you out of town a lot?
- Not if I have a reason
to stay home.

1499
01:32:21,623 --> 01:32:24,930
Is there anything
we've heard about you
that is true?

1500
01:32:26,628 --> 01:32:29,544
Yes. Two things.

1501
01:32:29,587 --> 01:32:31,763
I really love the opera--

1502
01:32:33,112 --> 01:32:34,940
and I really love Sarah.

1503
01:32:41,164 --> 01:32:43,862
- Come home with us.
- Thank you.

1504
01:32:46,691 --> 01:32:48,824
Let's go home.

1505
01:32:55,308 --> 01:32:58,224
So, bubbe,what kind
of acting do you do?

1506
01:32:58,268 --> 01:33:00,792
You know,
whatever comes up--
Stage, screen.

1507
01:33:00,836 --> 01:33:02,794
Are you in anything
right now?

1508
01:33:02,838 --> 01:33:05,318
Not right now,
but I got a production
coming up.

1509
01:33:05,362 --> 01:33:08,974
I just got cast
in Fiddler on the Roof.Ooh!

1510
01:33:09,018 --> 01:33:11,150
I love Fiddler on the Roof.

1511
01:33:11,194 --> 01:33:14,023

are you playing?

1512
01:33:14,066 --> 01:33:16,068
Perchik.

1513
01:33:16,112 --> 01:33:18,070
Who'd believe that?Right.

1514
01:33:18,114 --> 01:33:20,377

a couple of tickets.

1515
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:22,858
Mother.What?
We'll pay for them.

1516

I can get you guys
some tickets.

1517
01:33:24,903 --> 01:33:27,950
Last time we saw Fiddler
was at the old
Candlelight Theater.

1518
01:33:27,993 --> 01:33:30,343
It was the Drury Lane.

1519
01:33:30,387 --> 01:33:32,389
It was the old
Candlelight Theater.We saw Fiddler...

1520
01:33:32,432 --> 01:33:36,654
at the Drury Lane.I don't think
it was the Drury Lane.

1521
01:33:36,698 --> 01:33:39,526

at the Candlelight,

1522
01:33:39,570 --> 01:33:42,051

at the Garden,

1523
01:33:42,094 --> 01:33:45,358
