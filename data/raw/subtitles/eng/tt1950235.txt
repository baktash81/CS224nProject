I could call 911.

it's pinging off the cell towers

Tobin, should we play "Sound and Vision"?

889
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:50,083
No, I'm... I'm all good.

890
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:52,125
- Oh, come on, man. One more.
- What?

891
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:54,583
No, I think I'm gonna go check on Carla.

892
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:57,684
- The guys are probably gone by now, so...
- Wait, wait, wait, we can all go.

893
00:41:57,708 --> 00:41:58,708
I'm gonna go alone.

894
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,750
Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?

895
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,708
- Hey.
- What?

896
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,166
What? What do you mean "What?"

897
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:10,625
You're being weird.

898
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:12,750
- Leaving suddenly and...
- How is that weird?

899
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:15,375
- Tobin.
- Angie.

900
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:17,708
Why are you calling me Angie?

901
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:20,125
Well isn't that
what you like to be called? Mm?

902
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,291
God, since when did you get so sensitive?

903
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:25,583
OK, are you mad about JP?

904
00:42:25,958 --> 00:42:27,625
Why would I be mad about JP?

905
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:32,041
Are you jealous?

906
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,500
Yeah. Yeah, Angie.

907
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:36,625
I'm jealous of... of JP.

908
00:42:37,208 --> 00:42:40,791
I'm jealous of the enlightened,
broomball-playing, meditating college boy.

909
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,250
Fine.

910
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:48,125
Be that way.

911
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:00,916
[mutters] Oh, shit.

912
00:43:01,833 --> 00:43:03,166
Shit.

913
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:05,750
You a wise man?

914
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:09,125
Are you one of our three wise men?

915
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:10,541
Yes, I'm a wise man.

916
00:43:10,958 --> 00:43:11,958
Great.

918
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:24,375
No fair!

919
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:28,250
Um... We didn't order that.

920
00:43:28,416 --> 00:43:31,125
- Oh, I know. It's...
- Also, what is that?

921
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:32,451
I call it a "Quaffle Waffle."

922
00:43:32,583 --> 00:43:34,750
Best enjoyed
with a tall glass of Butterbeer.

923
00:43:38,041 --> 00:43:39,250
It's from <i>Harry Potter!</i>

924
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:40,708
Isn't that, like, for children?

925
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:43,875
I'm pretty sure it's universally beloved.

926
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:51,958
Also, I'm supposed to tell you guys

927
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:54,291
that there's gonna be
a party here later, so...

928
00:43:55,083 --> 00:43:56,083
you should stay.

929
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:01,041
Can I get another iced tea?

930
00:44:06,666 --> 00:44:08,541
- [sighs]
- Are they leaving?

931
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:11,723
Because Tempest just texted me
and he said he's gonna roll through.

932
00:44:12,791 --> 00:44:13,875
This is so messed up.

[church bells ringing]

934
00:44:16,708 --> 00:44:18,348
[Julie] Thanks again for walking me here.

935
00:44:18,541 --> 00:44:19,541
It's nothing.

936
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:23,083
[stammers] Hey, I didn't...

937
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,041
tell my mom about Colombia,
so when you meet her,

938
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:28,708
- just don't mention anything.
- Why didn't you tell your mom?

939
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,458
Because I didn't want her to worry,

940
00:44:30,541 --> 00:44:32,791
and also, try to convince me to go, so...

941
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:34,500
[Debbie] Hi, Sweetie.

942
00:44:34,833 --> 00:44:35,833
Hey.

Here are the clothes you asked for.

945
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Thank you.

946
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:41,750
Why did you need Grandpa's?

947
00:44:43,416 --> 00:44:44,416
Oh.

948
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:48,208

Hey.

950
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:51,083
Are you at school with Julie?

951
00:44:52,666 --> 00:44:53,708
No. [chuckles]

952
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:55,750
Are you kidding me?

953
00:44:56,583 --> 00:44:57,750
You met him on a train.

954
00:44:58,041 --> 00:44:59,416
- He could be a...
- He's not.

955
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:00,983
[Stuart] I don't mean to interrupt.

956
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:04,875
I... I would just like to say, you know,
I'm pretty responsible.

957
00:45:04,958 --> 00:45:07,458
You know, you look like that singer.

958
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:10,750

you know?

Oh, god.

964
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:25,791
I... I'm sorry.

965
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:27,416
I'll let my publicist know that one.

966
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:30,333
It's not all the time, you know?

967

Only from certain angles.

968
00:45:32,791 --> 00:45:34,583
OK, Stuart, here's some new clothes.

969
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:37,875
Mom, you should sit.
[inhales] I'm gonna go change.

I thought we were gonna meet up later.

Why?

00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:06,000
Did you not want me to know you were here?

976
00:46:07,458 --> 00:46:09,250
No, I, you know, just thought...

977
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:12,458
What, you just happened not to mention
that you were coming here?

978
00:46:14,416 --> 00:46:16,375
That's why you didn't answer
any of my texts?

979
00:46:18,958 --> 00:46:20,458
Are you rolling your eyes at me?

980
00:46:20,791 --> 00:46:21,791
No.

I called you a psycho.

984

Oh, she did not just call
that girl a psycho.

985
00:46:29,833 --> 00:46:31,101

'Cause as captain of the debate team,

I know words are super important to you,

so technically, if I were psycho,

992
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:43,458
I'd probably do this.

Excuse me?

OK? I don't have to see you
every second of every day.

to give a shit about you.

If Jeb breaks up with you,
you'll just find someone else

to chase after and freak out about
and I'll still be here,

same as always,
waiting to do this all over again,
