No! Hey!
What the fuck, dude?!

That's weird.

341
00:21:04,234 --> 00:21:07,234
It must only open
if the coffin's closed.

Well, I guess there's only
one way to find out.

speak highly of me.

I hated it at the same time.

604
00:39:57,408 --> 00:40:01,669
It's where my dad
would read to me...

605
00:40:04,408 --> 00:40:06,799
...where he taught me
how to ride a bike.

606
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:14,799
It's where he hurt my mom.

607
00:40:19,886 --> 00:40:21,539
I would go upstairs to my room,

608
00:40:21,712 --> 00:40:23,496
and I would hide under the bed.

609
00:40:26,017 --> 00:40:28,408
And one day,
while I was hiding, he...

610
00:40:32,843 --> 00:40:34,930
...threw my mom
across the floor

611

gonna answer.
