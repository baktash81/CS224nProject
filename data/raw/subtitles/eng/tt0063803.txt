I'm not annoyed.

41
00:06:56,796 --> 00:07:00,311
I just noticed the picture
of what's his name over there.

42
00:07:00,476 --> 00:07:03,149
- Wayne. You know, John Wayne.
WOMAN: Oh, yes.

43
00:07:03,316 --> 00:07:05,910
Yeah, but that isn't
an American magazine...

44
00:07:06,076 --> 00:07:08,954

You know what I mean?

Yes.

- What kind of magazine is that?
- French.

Ah? That doesn't look French.

They should have
an English version, though.

52
00:07:26,396 --> 00:07:29,513
Yeah, like the Italian movies,
when they dub it.

No, it just threw me, because I've seen
foreign magazines before...

tell right away what kind they are.

his name is Cicatrice, Spanish for "scar."

"You talk good English.
Somebody teach you?" But real nasty.

not Comanche, but Comanche...

99
00:09:48,996 --> 00:09:51,191
...to Scar, Scar says:

100
00:09:51,356 --> 00:09:53,995
"You talk good Comanche.
Somebody teach you?" But...

101
00:09:54,156 --> 00:09:57,068

J. R: Who?

102

- The man with the... The Indian.
- Cicatrice, Spanish for "scar." Yeah.

103
00:10:01,716 --> 00:10:03,866
He was more nasty
than Wayne could ever get.

104
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,231
- But then again, he was a bad guy.
- Oh.

105
00:10:06,676 --> 00:10:09,270
There were a lot of nasty Comanches
in that picture.

106

- Nasty picture.
- Well, then again...

107

nasty too, when he wanted to be.

Hunter is supposed to be trading rugs...

109

No, don't answer me,
I'll tell you why I can't.

of every block to get me when I walk.

So I may have to go to China

from Chinese people, okay? Good.
