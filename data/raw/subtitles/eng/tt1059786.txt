00:01:02,025 --> 00:01:04,825
Valhalla, this is Thor.
Valhalla, this is Thor.

2
00:01:04,905 --> 00:01:08,185
<i>We have visual on
a possible high-value target.</i>

3
00:01:08,305 --> 00:01:09,665
Thor, this is Valhalla.

4
00:01:09,785 --> 00:01:13,105
We're seeking positive ID
on target traveling in convoy

5
00:01:13,225 --> 00:01:16,145
and we're pushing
more assets your way.

6
00:01:16,305 --> 00:01:19,305
Contact Loki on secondary net.

7
00:01:19,385 --> 00:01:21,265
Loki, this is Thor.

8
00:01:21,345 --> 00:01:25,305
<i>Target is located at grid coordinates
two-four-Tango-Kilo-Bravo</i>

9
00:01:25,425 --> 00:01:28,625
<i>one-two-four-five-six-seven-three-niner.</i>

10
00:01:28,705 --> 00:01:30,385
<i>Confirm you have visual.</i>

11
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,785
Verifying target ID.

12
00:01:31,865 --> 00:01:33,825
Electro-optic and
infrared sensors are online.

13
00:01:33,945 --> 00:01:36,305
- Confirming target.
- SecDef is arriving now.

14
00:01:45,145 --> 00:01:47,345
Mr. Secretary, this way, sir.

15
00:01:51,665 --> 00:01:53,105
Attempting cell phone link
to moving target.

16
00:01:53,225 --> 00:01:55,025
Stand by for data feed.

17
00:01:57,745 --> 00:01:59,065
Stand by for audio.

18
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:00,305
Got it.

19
00:02:01,905 --> 00:02:05,545
Now, don't tell me you spotted the beard
in the middle of a goddamn sandstorm.

20
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,745
- Is it really him?
- We're confirming that now, sir.

21
00:02:08,825 --> 00:02:09,825
Sir, audio is coming up now.

22
00:02:09,945 --> 00:02:12,945
- Verifying voice pattern match.
- What do we have here, Sergeant?

23
00:02:13,825 --> 00:02:17,265
Four males. One of them is speaking
in a Rakhshani dialect,

24
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,825
consistent with our intel on al-Khoei.

25
00:02:22,305 --> 00:02:23,985
Sir, it's just coming up.

26
00:02:24,105 --> 00:02:27,505
"Thirty-seven percent" and "probable"
don't belong in the same sentence.

27
00:02:27,585 --> 00:02:29,065
I'm not taking this to the President.

28
00:02:29,145 --> 00:02:32,105
<i>CIA and NCTC concur it is the target,</i>

29
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,905
<i>based on reliable intel from the Brits.</i>

30
00:02:34,025 --> 00:02:36,225
They're pulling off the highway.

31
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:53,105
Criteria is not met. Recommend abort.

32
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:54,905
We have an abort recommendation.

33
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:58,625
If it's him, this guy comes out of hiding
every couple of years at best.

34
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:01,065
Sir, target is appearing
around the northeast corner.

35
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:07,825
We've got AK-47 s,
RPGs and Chaparral guided missiles.

36
00:03:07,905 --> 00:03:09,585
This is a training camp, Mr. Secretary.

37
00:03:09,705 --> 00:03:12,865
- Wait. Wait. Print. 51%.
- 51%.

38
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:15,705
- Abort rec still holds.
- All other PID options exhausted.

39
00:03:15,825 --> 00:03:18,025
What do you suggest we do, sir?

40
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:21,345
Is that a weapons cache?

41
00:03:21,465 --> 00:03:23,345
Sir, the placement of
the stones around the pit,

42
00:03:23,465 --> 00:03:26,865
marker for the five pillars of Islam.
I think it's a funeral.

43
00:03:26,985 --> 00:03:28,305
For Christ's sake.

44
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:32,305
Counsel, how many ways would this
violate the Geneva Convention?

45
00:03:32,385 --> 00:03:34,265
<i>We can invoke hors de combat.</i>

46
00:03:34,345 --> 00:03:37,185
There's no independent intel verifying
that this is, in fact, a funeral.

47
00:03:37,305 --> 00:03:40,385
Signal's got the President
from Air Force One, sir.

48
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:49,745
Mr. President,

49
00:03:49,865 --> 00:03:53,545
we have a 51% identity match
on Majid al-Khoei.

50
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:56,985
<i>The bad news is, there's
some possibility he's at a funeral.</i>

51
00:03:57,105 --> 00:04:00,625
You should also be aware
we have an abort recommendation.

52
00:04:00,705 --> 00:04:03,185
But the Joint Chiefs are urging a go.

53
00:04:03,945 --> 00:04:06,425
<i>All right, what's your recommendation?</i>

54
00:04:11,865 --> 00:04:16,145
Sir, we measure success by
the least amount of collateral damage.

55
00:04:16,825 --> 00:04:20,985
At 51% probability, the risk is too high.

56
00:04:21,105 --> 00:04:26,545
<i>And if it is al-Khoei and he walks,
I'm putting our people at risk.</i>

57
00:04:27,505 --> 00:04:28,905
<i>You have a go.</i>

58
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:34,425
Thank you, Mr. President.

59
00:04:39,105 --> 00:04:40,265
- We're weapons hot!
- We have weapons hot!

60
00:04:40,345 --> 00:04:42,665
- Loki, you are cleared to engage.
- Repeat, weapons hot. PID.

61
00:04:42,745 --> 00:04:45,945
We have handshake with the
MQ9 Reaper. Sending you images now.

62
00:04:46,065 --> 00:04:49,305
- Loki, target coordinates received.
- Yes, sir. Switching to IR sensor.

63
00:04:58,025 --> 00:04:59,785
Target is lased.

64
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,305
Master arm on.

65
00:05:03,385 --> 00:05:04,825
Missiles away.

66
00:05:08,865 --> 00:05:10,665
Ten seconds to impact.

67
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,785
You got to make a choice, fellas.

68
00:05:34,945 --> 00:05:39,225
Who are you going to be? Boys or men?

69
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:43,865
- I'm out on this one.
- Why?

70
00:05:43,985 --> 00:05:46,265
- 'Cause I'm broke.
- Come...

71
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:47,905
How do I know you don't have
something great under there?

72
00:05:48,025 --> 00:05:49,345
Kwame just paired the board.
I'm floating on the river here.

73
00:05:49,465 --> 00:05:50,505
Look at the table.

74
00:05:50,585 --> 00:05:53,345
I don't know. I'm supposed to take my
girl out later. It's a lot of money.

75
00:05:53,465 --> 00:05:56,465
Your girl out? Who's that?

76
00:05:56,545 --> 00:05:57,985
- Elaine?
- Yeah.

77
00:05:58,105 --> 00:06:00,065
You guys have been going out
for a while.

78
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:01,465
How long?

79
00:06:01,585 --> 00:06:03,745
- Couple months.
- Couple months? Wow.

80
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:06,865
- That's big. You have sex with her yet?
- Kinda.

81
00:06:06,985 --> 00:06:08,265
- What the hell is "kinda"?
- "Kinda"?

82
00:06:08,345 --> 00:06:09,545
- Personal question.
- Okay, well, listen.

83
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,825
Let me ask you a question.
What are you going to do tonight?

84
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:12,825
Fish filet and a Coke?

85
00:06:12,945 --> 00:06:14,505
Go to Blockbuster,
rent a little romantic comedy,

86
00:06:14,585 --> 00:06:16,185
go back to Mom's house,
sit on the couch?

87
00:06:16,305 --> 00:06:17,585
- How'd you know?
- Well, that's what you do.

88
00:06:17,665 --> 00:06:19,265
You're a dependable person.
That's what you're going to do.

89
00:06:19,385 --> 00:06:20,905
You know what you should do?

90
00:06:20,985 --> 00:06:23,185
You need to lay down some real green
and treat your lady right.

91
00:06:23,305 --> 00:06:25,105
You know, you need to take her
to a nice place.

92
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:28,185
Red Lobster. Olive Garden.
Tablecloths. Soft music.

93
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,185
And then you skip
this Blockbuster thing.

94
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:33,145
Girls want to go out. Especially a girl
as cute as your girl, you know?

95
00:06:33,265 --> 00:06:35,185
She wants to be seen.
That's why she dresses up.

96
00:06:35,265 --> 00:06:36,745
So you take her to the movies.

97
00:06:36,825 --> 00:06:38,305
- A little popcorn-drink combo.
- True. True.

98
00:06:38,425 --> 00:06:41,265
Elaine might want a hot dog and some
nachos, so you shell out for that, too.

99
00:06:41,385 --> 00:06:42,745
And then before you know it,

100
00:06:42,825 --> 00:06:43,985
she's cozying up
the way she never would've

101
00:06:44,065 --> 00:06:45,105
at her mom's house, you know?

102
00:06:45,225 --> 00:06:46,585
- Preach it. Preach it.
- Now all of a sudden, look.

103
00:06:46,665 --> 00:06:48,945
Gino Romero's walking tall
with Elaine yank-my-Dickinson,

104
00:06:49,025 --> 00:06:50,865
- all because he dared to dream tonight.
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

105
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:52,105
And he became a man.
And that's the choice.

106
00:06:52,185 --> 00:06:53,665
- Yes.
- And that's what's on the table.

107
00:06:53,785 --> 00:06:56,065
This is the dream right here.

108
00:06:56,185 --> 00:06:57,465
Are you a man?

109
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:58,705
- I'm with you.
- Okay, here we go.

110
00:06:58,785 --> 00:06:59,985
- I'm with you. Twenty?
- Twenty.

111
00:07:00,105 --> 00:07:01,465
Big boy game.

112
00:07:02,225 --> 00:07:03,065
Call.

113
00:07:03,745 --> 00:07:05,825
- Cowboys over aces, big Jer.
- Wow. Wow.

114
00:07:05,945 --> 00:07:07,345
- Didn't see that coming, huh?
- Yeah, that's a tough one.

115
00:07:07,465 --> 00:07:09,465
This is a tough one, too.
Four bullets, baby.

116
00:07:09,585 --> 00:07:12,145
Get out of here!
You baited me into that, Jer. Come on!

117
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,185
- That's the way it goes.
- So what happened to Red Lobster?

118
00:07:14,265 --> 00:07:15,825
No, I guess it's Mama's house
for you tonight.

119
00:07:15,905 --> 00:07:17,105
But look, I saved you 40 bucks.

120
00:07:17,185 --> 00:07:20,505
And now Elaine won't have to shell out
for herpes medication.

121
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,865
Break's over, bitches.
Freitag missed his shift again.

122
00:07:22,945 --> 00:07:24,065
- Someone's on collator duty.
- Great.

123
00:07:24,185 --> 00:07:25,945
All right, well, gentlemen,

124
00:07:26,065 --> 00:07:28,785
I'll give you a chance to win some of
this back tomorrow. Enjoy yourselves.

125
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,305
All right, man.

126
00:07:35,465 --> 00:07:37,945
Hey there. Welcome to Copy Cabana.
How can I help you?

127
00:07:38,065 --> 00:07:40,145
I couldn't get the machine
past the main menu.

128
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:41,785
- That machine there?
- Yeah.

129
00:07:41,905 --> 00:07:43,785
Did you swipe your credit card
to the left, sir?

130
00:07:43,865 --> 00:07:45,585
- Didn't do that.
- Well, that's your problem.

131
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:46,625
Why don't you try it again?

132
00:07:56,785 --> 00:07:58,705
<i>Cell phone users, beware.</i>

133
00:07:58,785 --> 00:08:02,825

141
00:08:24,585 --> 00:08:26,105
Did you drop this?

142
00:08:27,945 --> 00:08:28,945
Yes.

Jerry?

147
00:09:21,225 --> 00:09:24,345
Mrs. Wierzbowski! I was just...
I thought you might have been sleeping.

148
00:09:24,465 --> 00:09:25,785
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- So... But I have...

149
00:09:25,905 --> 00:09:27,665
I have some rent here.

150
00:09:27,745 --> 00:09:29,785
- Here you go.
- Yeah, some is good. All is better.

151
00:09:29,905 --> 00:09:31,665
Well, that's most of it. Here.

152
00:09:31,785 --> 00:09:33,025
$1, $1, $1...

153
00:09:33,145 --> 00:09:34,625
No, no, no. Look. Here's a five there.

154
00:09:34,745 --> 00:09:36,785
- Five.
- Yeah.

155
00:09:36,905 --> 00:09:38,825
Where is girl? I don't see her no more.

156
00:09:38,905 --> 00:09:41,065
You know you're the only woman for me.

157
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:42,865
No, that's done. She got smart.

158
00:09:42,985 --> 00:09:44,825
- Like the others.
- Yeah. Yeah.

159
00:09:45,505 --> 00:09:49,345
Is woman friend? Answer.
Then see if she give you money for rent.

160
00:09:50,705 --> 00:09:52,025
One second.

161
00:09:54,265 --> 00:09:55,465
Hey, Mom.

162
00:09:58,265 --> 00:09:59,305
What?

163
00:10:25,545 --> 00:10:27,865
- Looks just like him.
- I'm not him.

164
00:12:03,705 --> 00:12:06,345
Six months without a boo or a bah, huh?

165
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:07,945
Yes, sir.

166
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:10,065
So where were you this time?

167
00:12:11,505 --> 00:12:15,705
Alaska. Singapore.
I got a job there.

168
00:12:18,585 --> 00:12:22,545
I... I spoke to Stanford.

169
00:12:22,665 --> 00:12:23,585
I pulled some strings.

170
00:12:23,705 --> 00:12:25,425
They said they'd take you back.
Even though you took off...

171
00:12:25,505 --> 00:12:26,665
Two years ago, Dad.

172
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:30,265
Jerry, you know, it wouldn't kill you
to ask for help once in a while.

173
00:12:30,385 --> 00:12:31,545
You want to have
this conversation now?

174
00:12:31,665 --> 00:12:32,785
- It's Stanford!
- You want to do this today.

175
00:12:32,865 --> 00:12:33,785
You know how many people would kill...

176
00:12:33,905 --> 00:12:35,985
- Today? You want to have this now?
- Fine.

177
00:12:36,065 --> 00:12:39,185
You do whatever you want.
You always have.

178
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:49,585
You know, I keep thinking,
I'm going to walk in here one day

179
00:12:50,345 --> 00:12:54,105
and I'm not going to feel
like a stranger in my own house.

180
00:13:04,905 --> 00:13:06,745
I don't want your money.

181
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,625
<i>Can I have your attention, please?</i>

182
00:13:35,705 --> 00:13:39,865
<i>Smoking is not permitted on the train.
Chicago is next.</i>

183
00:13:58,745 --> 00:14:01,505
Can't find the keys
and he's late as usual.

184
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,505
- I'm going to have to take you.
- He'll be here.

185
00:14:05,385 --> 00:14:07,305
All right, wait five more minutes.

186
00:14:07,385 --> 00:14:09,345
Help me out here.
We came home last night.

187
00:14:09,465 --> 00:14:12,145
I put the leftovers down.
You turned on the TV. I went over,

188
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:15,745
said, "No TV, no TV, no TV."
Turned it off.

189
00:14:15,865 --> 00:14:16,905
Came over here.

190
00:14:16,985 --> 00:14:18,905
- Checked the messages.
- Knocked over the phone.

191
00:14:18,985 --> 00:14:21,305
Right, knocked over the phone.
Put it back.

192
00:14:21,385 --> 00:14:23,625
Put the leftovers in the fridge.

193
00:14:27,385 --> 00:14:28,305
Let's go!

194
00:14:28,465 --> 00:14:30,585
I put vitamins in your toiletry bag.
Don't forget to take...

195
00:14:30,705 --> 00:14:32,305
- Two in the morning and two at night.
- That's right.

196
00:14:32,385 --> 00:14:33,345
And your inhaler's
in the back of your bag.

197
00:14:33,465 --> 00:14:34,465
- Sammy!
- Daddy!

198
00:14:34,585 --> 00:14:37,025
Come here. You didn't think
I'd miss the big send-off, do you, huh?

199
00:14:37,145 --> 00:14:38,345
Let's get you on this train.

200
00:14:38,425 --> 00:14:40,025
- This must be your...
- Trumpet.

201
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,985
My God, this weighs, like, 200 pounds.
You carry this yourself?

202
00:14:42,105 --> 00:14:43,705
- Mr. and Mrs. Holloman!
- Miss.

203
00:14:43,825 --> 00:14:45,345
- You just made it.
- Right.

204
00:14:45,465 --> 00:14:46,865
- Here, Sam.
- Thanks.

205
00:14:46,945 --> 00:14:47,905
- Listen to me.
- I have one more here.

206
00:14:48,025 --> 00:14:50,705
All these other kids, right? They're
going to call their moms, too, all right?

207
00:14:50,785 --> 00:14:52,345
They're just going to lie about it.

208
00:14:52,465 --> 00:14:55,225
All right, and eat junk food 'cause this is
your one chance, but brush your teeth.

209
00:14:55,345 --> 00:14:58,425
Mom, you got to stop.
I'm going to miss you, too.

210
00:14:58,545 --> 00:15:00,065
<i>Capitol Limited to D.C. is
departing now.</i>

211
00:15:00,185 --> 00:15:01,225
Give me a hug.

212
00:15:01,305 --> 00:15:02,265
<i>All aboard.</i>

213
00:15:02,385 --> 00:15:04,265
- I love you so much.
- I love you, too.

214
00:15:05,825 --> 00:15:07,745
- Shine bright, okay?
- Okay.

215
00:15:08,985 --> 00:15:10,705
Rock the house, buddy.
You're going to be great. Okay?

216
00:15:10,825 --> 00:15:12,025
- Okay.
- I'll see you later.

217
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:14,665
- Bye!
- Have fun in D.C.!

218
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:17,305
- Bye, Mom!
- Your mom going to be okay?

219
00:15:17,425 --> 00:15:18,785
It's unclear.

220
00:15:19,905 --> 00:15:20,945
I'm so sorry. I got stuck in traffic,

221
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:23,065
- and I didn't even...
- Don't even say it.

222
00:15:25,305 --> 00:15:26,585
All aboard!

223
00:15:26,985 --> 00:15:28,865
Yes. Five-nine-one-three.

224
00:15:34,905 --> 00:15:36,625
It's here. It's here.

225
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,145
Okay, okay.

226
00:15:55,785 --> 00:15:57,905
- Come on!
- Two seconds. Sorry.

227
00:16:05,185 --> 00:16:06,385
No, wait.

228
00:16:15,185 --> 00:16:16,585
- Hey, hang on a second.
- Sorry.

229
00:16:16,665 --> 00:16:17,865
- You're dropping money.
- Sir, sir!

230
00:16:17,945 --> 00:16:20,585
Big date, you know?
Fingers crossed, huh?

231
00:16:23,985 --> 00:16:25,665
- Here you go. Have a good day!
- Thank you.

232
00:16:28,985 --> 00:16:29,985
- Jerry!
- What?

233
00:16:30,105 --> 00:16:31,865
- So many boxes.
- Boxes?

234
00:16:31,985 --> 00:16:34,345
I had to open your room.
All day they come.

235
00:16:34,425 --> 00:16:35,785
- Big boxes, small boxes.
- My boxes?

236
00:16:35,865 --> 00:16:37,185
I don't know.
Whose boxes would they be?

237
00:16:37,305 --> 00:16:39,505
- All right, okay.
- Look at them there. See in there?

238
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:40,945
- See, I put them all...
- Yeah. Yeah.

239
00:16:41,025 --> 00:16:42,705
- Listen, I have something for you here.
- Yeah.

240
00:16:42,825 --> 00:16:44,785
This is rent for this month
and next month, too, okay?

241
00:16:44,905 --> 00:16:46,545
- Oh, my.
- Thank you.

242
00:17:57,145 --> 00:17:58,105
Hello?

243
00:17:58,185 --> 00:18:00,665
<i>The FBI will arrive
at your apartment in 30 seconds.</i>

244
00:18:00,785 --> 00:18:02,305
<i>You must flee the premises.</i>

245
00:18:02,425 --> 00:18:03,505
Who... Who is this?

246
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,105
<i>You've been activated, Jerry.</i>

247
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:06,945
<i>- Who the hell is this?
- Your compliance is vital.</i>

248
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:07,985
How did you get this number?

249
00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:10,865
<i>You now have 24 seconds.
Leave your residence.</i>

250
00:18:10,945 --> 00:18:14,385
<i>Your destination, the Mathis train
station. We will guide you from there.</i>

251
00:18:14,465 --> 00:18:15,465
What is this?

252
00:18:15,545 --> 00:18:17,625
<i>The evidence in your
apartment is irrefutable.</i>

253
00:18:17,745 --> 00:18:18,665
<i>- Listen.
- 17 seconds.</i>

254
00:18:18,785 --> 00:18:19,705
I'm going to hang this phone up now.

255
00:18:19,825 --> 00:18:20,985
<i>They'll seek your arrest
for conspiracy, treason...</i>

256
00:18:21,105 --> 00:18:23,025
<i>- I'm hanging this phone up now!
- ... violating state and local law.</i>

257
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:24,905
<i>- You tell me how you got this number!
- Maximum penalty, death.</i>

258
00:18:24,985 --> 00:18:26,905
No, none of this is mine!

259
00:18:28,945 --> 00:18:32,105
FBI, FBI, FBI! Get down on the floor!

260
00:18:32,185 --> 00:18:33,785
Get on the ground!

261
00:18:35,385 --> 00:18:36,585
Down now! Get down!

262
00:18:36,665 --> 00:18:38,865
- I didn't do anything!
- Get down!

263
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:40,105
- Listen!
- Don't move.

264
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:42,465
It's not mine! It's not mine!

265
00:18:53,225 --> 00:18:55,345
This is obviously
some sort of mistake, right?

266
00:18:55,465 --> 00:18:58,265
I mean, I don't know
what I'm doing in this room, sir.

267
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,305
It's cold as hell outside.

268
00:19:01,865 --> 00:19:04,505
- You draw?
- I what?

269
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:08,025
Do you draw? Do you sketch?
You have ink all over your fingers.

270
00:19:10,185 --> 00:19:11,665
Look, you know you got
the wrong guy, right?

271
00:19:11,785 --> 00:19:13,065
I mean,
this is all some kind of sick joke.

272
00:19:13,145 --> 00:19:15,265
- I don't know what I'm doing here.
- Obviously.

273
00:19:15,385 --> 00:19:18,265
Obviously you have
nothing to do with it, yeah.

274
00:19:18,905 --> 00:19:20,825
Did you love your brother?

275
00:19:22,105 --> 00:19:24,665
Or did you hate him?
Did you admire him?

276
00:19:26,545 --> 00:19:29,225
Was your brother patriotic,
would you say?

277
00:19:32,265 --> 00:19:34,545
When's the last time you saw him?

278
00:19:36,185 --> 00:19:38,385
- Christmas.
- This past Christmas?

279
00:19:39,785 --> 00:19:42,705
- Three Christmases ago.
- Three years, huh?

280
00:19:42,825 --> 00:19:46,265
Well, the phone records show that you
haven't even called him in over a year.

281
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:49,025
So no text messages?
No smoke signals?

282
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:50,545
No MySpace or Facebook messages?

283
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,105
Yeah, so what are you trying to say?
We're not...

284
00:19:52,185 --> 00:19:53,265
Are you asking if we're the type of twins

285
00:19:53,385 --> 00:19:57,705
that wear the same shirt to the mall,
hold hands, and things like that? No.

286
00:19:58,105 --> 00:20:00,705
- Sir, I don't even know your name.
- I'm sorry, that was rude of me.

287
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:01,905
I'm Tom Morgan,

288
00:20:02,025 --> 00:20:05,345
the Supervising Agent assigned
to the Joint Terrorism Task Force.

289
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:09,905
You think I'm a terrorist?

290
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,105
No, you're a copy boy, aren't you?

291
00:20:12,185 --> 00:20:14,705
- I'm a copy associate.
- Copy associate.

292
00:20:15,385 --> 00:20:16,665
But your brother,

293
00:20:16,785 --> 00:20:20,785
it says here he was a little more,
I guess you'd say, ambitious than you.

294
00:20:20,905 --> 00:20:22,905
Graduated from
the Air Force Academy at 21,

295
00:20:23,025 --> 00:20:26,505
with an advanced degree in parallel
algorithms and quantum electronics.

296
00:20:26,585 --> 00:20:28,745
I don't even know what the hell
that stuff means. Do you?

297
00:20:28,825 --> 00:20:31,225
Cadet wing commander, valedictorian,
plum job in the Public Affairs...

298
00:20:31,345 --> 00:20:32,945
Yeah, no, I know what he did, sir.

299
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:34,425
Why'd you drop out of school, Jerry?

300
00:20:34,545 --> 00:20:36,785
Did your brother have
any influence on that decision?

301
00:20:36,905 --> 00:20:38,185
No, school just wasn't for me.

302
00:20:38,265 --> 00:20:40,665
No, I mean, who would want
a Stanford education anyway?

303
00:20:40,745 --> 00:20:43,585
More upward mobility
at Copy Cabana, I guess, right?

304
00:20:43,705 --> 00:20:47,625
I see you did a little backpacking.
Singapore, Bali, Indonesia.

305
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:48,945
Did odd jobs here and there.
So you've been around.

306
00:20:49,065 --> 00:20:50,065
Look, none of this has anything to do

307
00:20:50,185 --> 00:20:52,225
with any of the shit
that was in my apartment.

308
00:20:52,345 --> 00:20:54,345
Why would I send it to myself?
My name is on the lease.

309
00:20:54,425 --> 00:20:56,465
I'd have to be the dumbest terrorist
in the history of the world.

310
00:20:56,585 --> 00:20:57,945
So who deposited the 750?

311
00:20:58,065 --> 00:21:01,185
The...
I don't know who deposited the 750!

312
00:21:01,305 --> 00:21:02,545
God maybe? I thought it was a miracle,

313
00:21:02,665 --> 00:21:04,745
I took the money. That was my mistake.
It was an accident.

314
00:21:04,825 --> 00:21:06,545
Do accidents not happen
in your universe?

315
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:10,425
Well, the money originated
from the YTBC Bank of...

316
00:21:10,505 --> 00:21:12,385
Well, I'll be darned, Singapore.

317
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:15,185
Opened with a transfer from
a corporation called The Star of Orion,

318
00:21:15,305 --> 00:21:17,425
- a dummy front for Hezbollah.
- This is all very interesting, sir.

319
00:21:17,545 --> 00:21:20,465
- It has nothing to do with me.
- We find hardware in your apartment.

320
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:22,345
Latest military spec.

321
00:21:22,425 --> 00:21:23,625
- Airplane manuals.
- I told you about this already.

322
00:21:23,705 --> 00:21:26,265
And 1,200 pounds
of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.

323
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:27,305
I walked into my apartment...

324
00:21:27,425 --> 00:21:29,025
You planning on becoming
a farmer or something?

325
00:21:29,145 --> 00:21:31,385
I walk into my apartment,
I open the door,

326
00:21:31,505 --> 00:21:32,625
and this shit's all over my apartment.

327
00:21:32,745 --> 00:21:34,105
- It just showed up.
- It just showed up.

328
00:21:34,185 --> 00:21:36,945
I see. I'm just curious
if your brother knew anything about it.

329
00:21:37,025 --> 00:21:40,945
Of course, we haven't really established
how close you guys were yet, have we?

330
00:21:41,065 --> 00:21:43,745
Well, we were pretty close this morning
when I buried his body in the ground.

331
00:21:44,585 --> 00:21:46,305
Does that establish anything for you?
Somebody set me up.

332
00:21:46,425 --> 00:21:47,665
Why is that so hard
for you to understand?

333
00:21:47,745 --> 00:21:49,145
- "Somebody."
- A woman called me on the phone.

334
00:21:49,265 --> 00:21:50,305
She told me I was going to be arrested.

335
00:21:50,425 --> 00:21:51,705
"A woman." Your mom? Who?

336
00:21:51,825 --> 00:21:55,185
I don't know! If I knew, I would tell you!
I don't know!

337
00:21:58,945 --> 00:22:00,465
Here's the thing, Jerry.

338
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:03,625
This is a bad time to be
in the terrorism business.

339
00:22:03,705 --> 00:22:05,345
You read the paper.

340
00:22:06,585 --> 00:22:08,465
Who do you think is winning?

341
00:22:08,545 --> 00:22:13,185
Your Miranda rights or my right to keep
you in this room as long as I want to?

342
00:22:13,305 --> 00:22:15,985
I don't care if you tell me
the truth about your brother.

343
00:22:16,105 --> 00:22:18,225
I don't care who you work for.

344
00:22:18,345 --> 00:22:23,665
'Cause no matter what you tell me,
you're in a shitload of trouble, son.

345
00:22:29,705 --> 00:22:32,505
This is insane. I work for Copy Cabana.

346
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:34,545
Yeah, that's what you said.

347
00:22:41,545 --> 00:22:43,145
Listen, I get one night out
in a decade, ladies,

348
00:22:43,225 --> 00:22:45,185
I am not wasting it on Lemon Drops.

349
00:22:45,305 --> 00:22:47,305
- Okay.
- Buck up. Let's go.

350
00:22:53,025 --> 00:22:53,945
Oh, gosh.

351
00:22:54,585 --> 00:22:57,705
I want updates. Catfights, booty calls,
somebody tell me they got lucky.

352
00:22:57,785 --> 00:23:01,745
Hey, ladies. See that guy over there?
He'd like to buy you a round.

353
00:23:02,665 --> 00:23:05,065
Hell, no.
He's got light beer written all over him.

354
00:23:05,145 --> 00:23:06,225
- He's cute.
- Come on.

355
00:23:06,305 --> 00:23:07,345
He's a suit. No.

356
00:23:07,425 --> 00:23:08,625
You sure?

357
00:23:08,705 --> 00:23:09,985
- Come on.
- Who is it?

358
00:23:10,745 --> 00:23:13,625
The one man in my life
who hasn't let me down.

359
00:23:14,265 --> 00:23:17,665
- That's sweet.
- All right, don't drink those without me.

360
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:19,785
Hello?

361
00:23:20,345 --> 00:23:21,505
Hello?

362
00:23:22,425 --> 00:23:25,985
<i>There's a McDonald's across the street.
Look in the window.</i>

363
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:27,105
What is this?

364
00:23:27,225 --> 00:23:29,705
<i>Would you risk your life for your son?</i>

365
00:23:35,505 --> 00:23:37,865
<i>Rachel Holloman,
you've been activated.</i>

366
00:23:37,945 --> 00:23:39,665
<i>- This isn't funny.
- Your compliance is vital.</i>

367
00:23:39,745 --> 00:23:41,665
<i>- Who are you?
- We will derail his train,</i>

368
00:23:41,785 --> 00:23:43,305
<i>unless you do what you're told.</i>

369
00:23:43,385 --> 00:23:44,345
What is this?

370
00:23:44,425 --> 00:23:46,145
<i>Don't go back inside the restaurant.</i>

371
00:23:46,265 --> 00:23:48,625
<i>- What?
- There's a black Porsche Cayenne</i>

372
00:23:48,745 --> 00:23:51,345
<i>parked at the northeast corner
of this block.</i>

373
00:23:51,465 --> 00:23:54,545
<i>The keys are in the ignition.
Start walking.</i>

374
00:23:57,105 --> 00:23:58,385
Oh, my God.

375
00:24:01,465 --> 00:24:03,345
<i>911.
State the nature of your emergency.</i>

376
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:06,305
Yeah, some woman just called me.
I have... I have no idea who she is.

377
00:24:06,425 --> 00:24:08,305
She was telling me that...

378
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:16,305
<i>Your phone is being monitored.
Disobey again and your son dies.</i>

379
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,705
Hey, Grant, I can't read this Shaw file.

380
00:24:22,825 --> 00:24:24,705
- Grant!
- Excuse me.

381
00:24:25,225 --> 00:24:27,945
Listen, my eyes aren't getting any better
and these screens are getting smaller.

382
00:24:28,025 --> 00:24:29,465
Could you please find me
something I can read?

383
00:24:29,585 --> 00:24:30,985
I can make the text bigger
on your screen.

384
00:24:31,065 --> 00:24:32,505
No, no, no. I'm talking about paper.

385
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:33,905
Remember, like in the olden times?

386
00:24:34,025 --> 00:24:35,465
- Paper. Okay.
- Yeah.

387
00:24:35,585 --> 00:24:38,345
Agent Morgan. Zoe Perez,
Air Force Special Investigations.

388
00:24:38,425 --> 00:24:40,785
Ethan Shaw, the twin,
he was one of ours.

389
00:24:40,865 --> 00:24:43,425
Yeah.
OSI said they were sending a liaison.

390
00:24:43,545 --> 00:24:45,185
Can you walk and talk
at the same time?

391
00:24:45,305 --> 00:24:46,505
I'll do my best.

392
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,385
File says he died in a traffic accident.

393
00:24:48,505 --> 00:24:52,145
Truck ran a light, corner of
Constitution and 10th, Northwest D.C.

394
00:24:52,225 --> 00:24:54,425
So truck ran a light,
his brother gets 750 large

395
00:24:54,545 --> 00:24:56,625
and enough hardware
to start his own Costco,

396
00:24:56,705 --> 00:24:59,065
five hours after enemy
chatter hits the roof.

397
00:24:59,145 --> 00:25:00,945
I mean, don't you find that
a little coincidental?

398
00:25:01,025 --> 00:25:05,505
<i>What if it's a decoy? To distract us from
something 50 times bigger.</i>

399
00:25:16,745 --> 00:25:19,585
- Time for your phone call.
- I thought I didn't get one.

400
00:25:19,705 --> 00:25:22,465
Attorney General's office
changed their mind.

401
00:25:24,265 --> 00:25:26,385
Ethan Shaw had a 183 IQ

402
00:25:26,505 --> 00:25:28,705
and yet you had him
as a mid-level press flak.

403
00:25:28,825 --> 00:25:30,305
Why not IT or cyber-warfare?

404
00:25:30,425 --> 00:25:32,385
Are you suggesting
that he was overqualified?

405
00:25:32,505 --> 00:25:34,745
Or that he was somehow slipping intel
to the Copy Cabana?

406
00:25:34,865 --> 00:25:36,585
No, I'm suggesting
that maybe Ethan Shaw

407
00:25:36,665 --> 00:25:40,625
was a superstar rocket scientist genius
who did go wrong,

408
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:44,145
and the Air Force doesn't want
their dirty laundry flapping in the wind.

409
00:25:44,225 --> 00:25:47,825
Think what you like, but I need to get in
that room and interrogate him myself.

410
00:25:47,905 --> 00:25:48,865
No.

411
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,505
You don't have a choice. Look.

412
00:25:59,585 --> 00:26:02,545
Now, neither of us know if either of
those brothers are guilty or innocent,

413
00:26:02,665 --> 00:26:07,145
so on behalf of the Secretary
of the Air Force, I'm going in that room.

414
00:26:07,945 --> 00:26:10,545
Well, on behalf of
all that fucking bomb equipment

415
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:13,505
in junior pinhead's apartment,
no, you're not.

416
00:26:22,585 --> 00:26:25,785
<i>We told you to run.
We have planned your escape.</i>

417
00:26:25,905 --> 00:26:27,705
How'd you get on this phone?
Who are you?

418
00:26:27,825 --> 00:26:29,585
<i>Lay flat on the floor immediately.</i>

419
00:26:29,665 --> 00:26:31,025
What the...
What the hell are you talking about?

420
00:26:31,105 --> 00:26:32,185
<i>Four seconds, Jerry.</i>

421
00:26:32,305 --> 00:26:34,385
<i>- No, this is bullshit. I don't...
- Get down now.</i>

422
00:26:34,465 --> 00:26:35,705
<i>Two seconds.</i>

423
00:26:58,025 --> 00:26:58,985
No!

424
00:27:02,265 --> 00:27:05,065
- No! I didn't do this!
- Get down!

425
00:27:09,865 --> 00:27:11,225
Shit.

426
00:27:43,305 --> 00:27:46,825
<i>Standing passengers,
please do not lean against the doors.</i>

427
00:27:51,705 --> 00:27:55,425
<i>... fourteen Americans dead
throughout Europe and the Middle East,</i>

428
00:27:55,545 --> 00:27:58,225
<i>with terror groups insisting
this is just the beginning</i>

429
00:27:58,345 --> 00:28:02,225
<i>of a campaign the West invited
when it allegedly rained bombs</i>

430
00:28:02,345 --> 00:28:05,225
<i>on a religious ceremony
outside the small town of Abda,</i>

431
00:28:05,305 --> 00:28:07,505
<i>near the border of Afghanistan.</i>

432
00:28:18,265 --> 00:28:22,025
<i>Stay on the train for three more stations
and wait at the bottom of the platform.</i>

433
00:28:22,105 --> 00:28:23,785
<i>You will receive...</i>

434
00:28:44,505 --> 00:28:49,905
<i>Doors closing. Standing passengers,
please do not lean against the doors.</i>

435
00:29:14,425 --> 00:29:16,585
- Help!
- Jimmy.

436
00:29:16,665 --> 00:29:20,425
My baby. I need some help. Somebody.

437
00:29:20,505 --> 00:29:22,065
<i>- What?
- You're not listening.</i>

438
00:29:22,145 --> 00:29:23,745
<i>We told you to stay on the train.</i>

439
00:29:23,865 --> 00:29:26,425
<i>- How are you doing this?
- Next stop is Wilson Station.</i>

440
00:29:26,545 --> 00:29:29,145
<i>A black Porsche Cayenne will be
waiting at the northwest exit.</i>

441
00:29:29,265 --> 00:29:30,665
<i>- Listen.
- Get in the passenger seat.</i>

442
00:29:30,745 --> 00:29:33,185
Listen! No, I'm done.

443
00:29:35,105 --> 00:29:38,265
<i>- Hello?
- The man in front of the exit door</i>

444
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:40,745
<i>in a black coat is a wanted terrorist.</i>

445
00:29:40,865 --> 00:29:43,825
<i>- His name is Jerry Shaw.
- Who is this?</i>

446
00:29:46,505 --> 00:29:47,465
- You Jerry Shaw?
- No, no, no.

447
00:29:47,545 --> 00:29:49,465
<i>Wilson Station. Exit now.</i>

448
00:29:49,945 --> 00:29:51,385
That's the guy!

449
00:29:53,305 --> 00:29:56,065
I said, are you Jerry Shaw?
Hey! Come here!

450
00:30:17,305 --> 00:30:18,545
Watch it!

451
00:30:23,305 --> 00:30:24,625
- Drive the car! Drive the car!
- No!

452
00:30:24,705 --> 00:30:26,225
- I did what you asked me to do!
- I'm not going anywhere...

453
00:30:26,345 --> 00:30:27,745
- You tell... Stop!
...until you tell me my son's safe!

454
00:30:27,865 --> 00:30:29,665
Who's your son?
I don't know what you're talking about!

455
00:30:29,785 --> 00:30:31,665
- I'll kill you if you hurt my son!
- I almost died over this shit!

456
00:30:31,785 --> 00:30:33,465
- Listen, lady, I don't know who...
- Tell me Sam is safe!

457
00:30:33,585 --> 00:30:34,905
Who is... Will you stop hitting me?

458
00:30:35,025 --> 00:30:37,505
Are you the woman
who called me on the phone?

459
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:39,825
- Did you call me on the phone?
- No. The woman.

460
00:30:39,945 --> 00:30:41,345
- She called you, too?
- She called you, too?

461
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:42,625
<i>Drive.</i>

462
00:30:44,985 --> 00:30:47,385
Get out! Now! Get out of the vehicle!

463
00:30:48,905 --> 00:30:49,945
Stop!

464
00:30:57,145 --> 00:30:59,185
- Why is this happening?
- Go, go, go, go, go!

465
00:30:59,265 --> 00:31:01,105
Who are you and
why are people shooting at us?

466
00:31:01,185 --> 00:31:03,465
Drive the car! Clutch!

467
00:31:03,545 --> 00:31:06,985
<i>Accelerate. Turn right, 200 feet.
You have pursuers.</i>

468
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:09,745
<i>- Yeah, no shit! Who are you?
- No questions.</i>

469
00:31:10,705 --> 00:31:12,105
<i>Turn right now.</i>

470
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:19,745
So you don't know anything about Sam?

471
00:31:19,865 --> 00:31:21,665
What, you mean your son?
No, I know nothing.

472
00:31:21,785 --> 00:31:22,705
Just like you don't know how to drive.

473
00:31:22,785 --> 00:31:24,385
Use the clutch before you shift,
not while you shift!

474
00:31:24,505 --> 00:31:25,505
I don't need driving lessons
from you, asshole!

475
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:27,425
What, you drive like this
and I'm the asshole?

476
00:31:27,545 --> 00:31:28,945
<i>Turn left now.</i>

477
00:31:36,345 --> 00:31:39,985
All units. Suspect in a Porsche
Cayenne heading west on Grand.

478
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,545
- All units respond, Code 3.
- There!

479
00:31:48,025 --> 00:31:51,985
<i>Maintain a speed of 50 miles an hour.
Stay in the second lane from the right.</i>

480
00:31:52,065 --> 00:31:54,385
<i>- The light's red!
- Accelerate now.</i>

481
00:32:04,345 --> 00:32:06,425
Get me a roadblock
at Granville and Sheridan.

482
00:32:06,545 --> 00:32:07,705
Oh, shit.

483
00:32:11,065 --> 00:32:13,345
The lights are all turning green.

484
00:32:17,785 --> 00:32:19,025
Holy shit!

485
00:32:32,745 --> 00:32:34,185
- Holy...
- Shit!

486
00:32:37,585 --> 00:32:38,985
Get in close.

487
00:32:40,985 --> 00:32:42,305
Go, go, go!

488
00:32:44,985 --> 00:32:47,665
<i>- Shit!
- Brake. Brake now.</i>

489
00:32:48,305 --> 00:32:49,625
Get in here!

490
00:32:58,785 --> 00:33:01,265
<i>Accelerate to 60 miles per hour.</i>

491
00:33:03,745 --> 00:33:05,385
Clutch. Clutch!

492
00:33:05,865 --> 00:33:07,105
- Use the clutch!
- I'm clutching!

493
00:33:07,225 --> 00:33:09,585
I'm watching, you're not clutching!

494
00:33:12,705 --> 00:33:14,665
- Stop!
- I'm not stopping.

495
00:33:16,865 --> 00:33:18,625
Slow down. Slow down, the light's red.

496
00:33:18,745 --> 00:33:21,625
<i>Don't slow down.
Accelerate to 72 miles per hour.</i>

497
00:33:21,745 --> 00:33:23,545
<i>- Slow down. It's a red light!
- You will make it through.</i>

498
00:33:23,665 --> 00:33:25,025
- Stop!
- No way.

499
00:33:25,785 --> 00:33:27,265
- Brake!
- I can't!

500
00:33:28,865 --> 00:33:30,545
- Brake!
- Stop!

501
00:33:47,785 --> 00:33:49,465
<i>Manual control's been restored.</i>

502
00:33:49,585 --> 00:33:52,785
<i>Continue straight
until you reach Pier 15.</i>

503
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,945
<i>Enter the wrecking yard.
Proceed to the end of the dock.</i>

504
00:34:03,065 --> 00:34:05,665
<i>We will eliminate all obstacles for you.</i>

505
00:34:14,065 --> 00:34:15,745
Watch! Watch! Watch!

506
00:34:44,705 --> 00:34:46,585
<i>- Stay your course.
- Turn!</i>

507
00:34:48,145 --> 00:34:50,185
<i>- Turn!
- Turn right now.</i>

508
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:07,625
Holy...

509
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:20,705
Oh, God.

510
00:35:22,185 --> 00:35:23,145
Oh, my God!

511
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,345
- Grab the seat.
- I can't.

512
00:35:28,465 --> 00:35:30,785
- Grab the seat! The seat!
- No, I can't!

513
00:35:32,785 --> 00:35:33,705
No!

514
00:35:45,305 --> 00:35:48,745
<i>The crane will release the car.
If you do not jump, you will drown.</i>

515
00:35:48,825 --> 00:35:51,905
- We have to jump.
- No! No way.

516
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:54,665
We have to. When I say "go."

517
00:35:57,305 --> 00:35:58,225
Ready?

518
00:35:59,385 --> 00:36:01,585
Go! Jump!

519
00:36:20,065 --> 00:36:22,025
I want both the divers in that water!

520
00:36:26,065 --> 00:36:27,745
- Let's go! Move!
- Let's go, let's go!

521
00:36:27,865 --> 00:36:29,025
Move, move, move!

522
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:48,865
- Yeah, I already called it in!
- Wait till it clears!

523
00:36:50,425 --> 00:36:51,865
Thirty feet back, that's it!

524
00:36:51,985 --> 00:36:53,345
Yeah, I know,
the Army sent a Black Hawk,

525
00:36:53,465 --> 00:36:54,745
so I'll be there in a couple of hours.

526
00:36:54,865 --> 00:36:57,705
What do you mean,
the car is not registered to anyone?

527
00:36:57,785 --> 00:36:58,945
Check the VIN number again.

528
00:36:59,665 --> 00:37:03,945
<i>Leave your message for Sam,
even though I know it's you, Mom.</i>

529
00:37:04,585 --> 00:37:07,185
Sam? Baby, listen to me.

530
00:37:07,265 --> 00:37:10,025
You need to call me
as soon as you get this message, okay?

531
00:37:10,745 --> 00:37:14,305
Baby, please. I love you.

532
00:37:16,185 --> 00:37:17,865
- What about the girl?
- What?

533
00:37:17,945 --> 00:37:19,425
What about the girl?

534
00:37:19,545 --> 00:37:21,425
Well, the Department of Transpo
tells me that there was

535
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:23,905
a seven-minute equipment failure
on their traffic cams.

536
00:37:24,025 --> 00:37:25,585
- We didn't get a picture of her.
- Don't tell me that.

537
00:37:25,705 --> 00:37:28,065
- That's what they're telling me!
- I need an ID on that girl.

538
00:37:30,745 --> 00:37:32,745
Do you think they could derail a train?

539
00:37:34,305 --> 00:37:36,305
They changed every traffic light
to get us here.

540
00:37:36,425 --> 00:37:38,145
The woman, she called me
on a stranger's cell phone

541
00:37:38,265 --> 00:37:40,345
who happened to be sitting next to me.
Never met the guy in my life.

542
00:37:40,465 --> 00:37:42,305
You know, and then they broke me out
of maximum security custody

543
00:37:42,425 --> 00:37:44,545
in a way I'm not even gonna describe
to you because it sounds crazy,

544
00:37:44,665 --> 00:37:48,105
and then they lift us off the face of
the Earth and drop us into this shit pile?

545
00:37:48,185 --> 00:37:49,385
She could probably derail a train.

546
00:37:49,465 --> 00:37:51,065
She could probably turn a train
into a talking duck.

547
00:37:51,425 --> 00:37:54,945
And what about these goddamn ghost
cranes that keep helping peewee out?

548
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:57,785
I mean, they don't just lift cars
up in the air all by themselves

549
00:37:57,905 --> 00:37:59,345
like a giant pair of chopsticks.

550
00:38:00,505 --> 00:38:02,345
I want to know how these things run,
how they're programmed.

551
00:38:03,065 --> 00:38:04,785
What'd you say your name was?

552
00:38:04,905 --> 00:38:06,905
- Rachel.
- I'm Jerry.

553
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,905
<i>- Hello?
- The barge will dock in 14 minutes.</i>

554
00:38:16,985 --> 00:38:21,105
<i>Leave the boatyard with the female.
Take Highway 123 East.</i>

555
00:38:21,185 --> 00:38:23,665
<i>Walk to mile marker 108.</i>

556
00:38:24,305 --> 00:38:28,305
- What? Was it her?
- She called you "the female."

557
00:38:29,305 --> 00:38:32,665
Have Mortuary Affairs freeze everything
belonging to Ethan Shaw.

558
00:38:32,785 --> 00:38:35,945
- No personal effects to next of kin.
- You, Due Process!

559
00:38:36,025 --> 00:38:37,785
- Bye.
- What do you have on Ethan Shaw?

560
00:38:37,905 --> 00:38:40,465
I have a name. It's Agent Perez.

561
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:42,705
And I'll answer that question
when I get back from D.C.

562
00:38:42,785 --> 00:38:46,065
- Wait a minute. What's in D.C.?
- Shaw's private quarters.

563
00:38:46,145 --> 00:38:49,905
I need you to stay here.
I'm not losing my link to Ethan Shaw.

564
00:38:49,985 --> 00:38:51,945
Maybe I haven't made this clear.

565
00:38:52,025 --> 00:38:54,905
I don't work for you.
I work for the Air Force.

566
00:38:54,985 --> 00:38:57,625
Keep your phone on,
I'll keep you updated.

567
00:39:02,945 --> 00:39:06,785
If you're staring at me, it better be
because I'm the goddamn suspect.

568
00:39:07,065 --> 00:39:10,385
Because if I don't get some good leads
soon, you're all gonna be demoted

569
00:39:10,505 --> 00:39:13,705
into something that's gonna require
touching shit with your hands.

570
00:39:14,105 --> 00:39:16,705
Now, let's get going. We got work to do.

571
00:39:24,065 --> 00:39:27,505
Hexamethylene.
Our latest chemical explosive.

572
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:32,785
One single tiny crystal,
80 times more powerful than C4.

573
00:39:32,905 --> 00:39:35,145
Odorless, undetectable.

574
00:39:35,225 --> 00:39:38,705
<i>And best of all, it can be
cut down in size for stealth operations.</i>

575
00:39:38,825 --> 00:39:40,625
This valve is a sonic trigger.

576
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:42,905
<i>The sound frequency
triggers the explosion.</i>

577
00:39:43,025 --> 00:39:45,105
Each trigger is programmed
to have a unique

578
00:39:45,225 --> 00:39:47,745
frequency specific
only to one Hex crystal.

579
00:39:47,865 --> 00:39:49,705
<i>That frequency triggers the explosion.</i>

580
00:39:54,905 --> 00:39:55,985
<i>Yeah.</i>

581
00:39:56,705 --> 00:39:59,825
We recently received approval
to begin shipping to the field.

582
00:39:59,905 --> 00:40:01,625
Two hundred units
are shipping out today.

583
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,305
- Sign right here.
- Yeah.

584
00:40:24,665 --> 00:40:25,825
Thank you.

585
00:40:29,105 --> 00:40:32,385
<i>The package you've just received
contains a small metal valve.</i>

586
00:40:32,505 --> 00:40:33,905
<i>Open the package.</i>

587
00:40:37,505 --> 00:40:38,985
<i>- Okay.
- Remove the valve</i>

588
00:40:39,105 --> 00:40:41,305
<i>and follow our instructions precisely.</i>

589
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:52,545
<i>- You've received the package.
- Yes, ma'am, it just arrived.</i>

590
00:40:52,665 --> 00:40:54,865
<i>- What kind of stone is this?
- No questions.</i>

591
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:56,465
<i>Cut the stone and place the setting</i>

592
00:40:56,585 --> 00:40:58,665
<i>according to the specifications
we sent you.</i>

593
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:42,785
<i>I'd just dropped my son off at the train.</i>

594
00:41:42,905 --> 00:41:45,585
<i>I was out having drinks with my
girlfriends when the call came.</i>

595
00:41:45,705 --> 00:41:48,185
<i>- What about you?
- The first call came to my apartment.</i>

596
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:50,385
<i>- After the boxes?
- Yeah.</i>

597
00:41:51,865 --> 00:41:54,825
Well, then this whole thing's
obviously gotta be about your brother.

598
00:41:54,905 --> 00:41:56,945
- Really, it's that obvious, huh?
- I mean, you got all this stuff.

599
00:41:57,025 --> 00:41:58,465
The weapons, the cash,
the airplane manuals.

600
00:41:58,585 --> 00:41:59,585
- Okay.
- He was your twin.

601
00:41:59,705 --> 00:42:00,665
- They sent it to the wrong brother.
- Right.

602
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:01,905
So you're implying
my brother's a terrorist.

603
00:42:01,985 --> 00:42:04,465
I'm implying, if not him, then why you?

604
00:42:09,345 --> 00:42:12,745
I'm sorry. I know he just died. I'm not
trying to insult his memory or anything.

605
00:42:12,865 --> 00:42:15,625
No, he hasn't been dead long enough
to be a memory, Rachel.

606
00:42:16,185 --> 00:42:17,705
If you knew my brother,
you'd laugh all day at the idea

607
00:42:17,825 --> 00:42:19,785
that he was a terrorist or a spy
or whatever else you're saying...

608
00:42:19,865 --> 00:42:20,945
- How do you know?
- Because he's my brother.

609
00:42:21,025 --> 00:42:22,225
That's something you would know
about your brother.

610
00:42:22,305 --> 00:42:24,505
Well, when's the last time
you talked to him?

611
00:42:29,705 --> 00:42:34,225
I don't need this. Hey, listen. Hey!
I don't have to explain myself to you.

612
00:42:34,305 --> 00:42:36,065
- Is your son a terrorist?
- Yeah, my son's a terrorist.

613
00:42:36,185 --> 00:42:38,185
Yeah, well, he's just as likely
to be a terrorist as my brother.

614
00:42:38,265 --> 00:42:40,785
And let's not forget you in all this. Why
are you here? What's your day job?

615
00:42:40,905 --> 00:42:42,585
- I know it isn't manual shift driver.
- I'm a paralegal.

616
00:42:43,465 --> 00:42:44,345
- I don't have a connection to anything.
- Paralegal?

617
00:42:44,345 --> 00:42:44,625
- I don't have a connection to anything.
- Paralegal?

618
00:42:44,745 --> 00:42:46,865
How do I know you're not lying to me?
What does a paralegal do?

619
00:42:46,985 --> 00:42:48,705
The same thing as the guys
with their names on the door,

620
00:42:48,825 --> 00:42:52,105
except I do it for $11 an hour,
so they can bill 200.

621
00:42:52,185 --> 00:42:53,505
That nail it for you, Sherlock?

622
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:55,065
That still doesn't explain why
we're walking out here...

623
00:42:55,185 --> 00:42:57,345
- I don't know why the hell I'm out here!
- Yeah, I know...

624
00:43:04,385 --> 00:43:05,305
Hey!

625
00:43:06,825 --> 00:43:08,945
- Are you Jerry Shaw?
- Who are you?

626
00:43:09,065 --> 00:43:11,345
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- I sent the package like she asked.

627
00:43:11,465 --> 00:43:12,705
- Wait, what package?
- What is that?

628
00:43:12,825 --> 00:43:14,025
- Now she wants me to drive you?
- Who, "she"?

629
00:43:14,105 --> 00:43:15,425
- I won't. I'm done!
- You know "she"?

630
00:43:15,545 --> 00:43:16,545
- Wait.
- Stay right there.

631
00:43:16,665 --> 00:43:18,065
- Get back.
- Here. Here's the address.

632
00:43:18,145 --> 00:43:20,945
- Why are you attack...
- Here. Here are the keys.

633
00:43:21,025 --> 00:43:21,945
Take the goddamn van!

634
00:43:22,065 --> 00:43:22,985
- You think I'm going to...
- Who's doing this?

635
00:43:23,105 --> 00:43:26,545
...do this because I'm Iranian?
I am American. I'm finished! I'm done!

636
00:43:26,665 --> 00:43:29,065
- What? What are you talking about?
- You take it!

637
00:43:29,145 --> 00:43:30,865
- What are you talking about?
- I won't do this because I can't.

638
00:43:30,985 --> 00:43:32,905
<i>- Hello?
- Stop him now, or he will die.</i>

639
00:43:33,025 --> 00:43:34,505
Listen to me,
what are you talking about?

640
00:43:34,625 --> 00:43:36,505
- You try to do this without me!
- How are you seeing us right now?

641
00:43:36,625 --> 00:43:38,705
<i>- Stop him now.
- What is she saying?</i>

642
00:43:38,785 --> 00:43:41,065
Stop. Hey! You gotta stop!

643
00:43:41,145 --> 00:43:43,865
- Wait!
- You gotta stop!

644
00:44:15,865 --> 00:44:18,745
<i>- You killed that man.
- Desertion is not an option.</i>

645
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:21,545
<i>Take the van.
Drive to Indianapolis, Indiana.</i>

646
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:26,185
<i>72 West 56th Street.
Arrive no later than 11:00 a.m.</i>

647
00:44:37,865 --> 00:44:39,985
- Welcome.
- Hello. Agent Perez.

648
00:44:40,705 --> 00:44:41,825
- To the right?
- Yes, ma'am.

649
00:44:43,025 --> 00:44:44,625
- ID, ma'am.
- OSI.

650
00:44:44,745 --> 00:44:47,225
I ordered a freeze on Ethan Shaw's
personal effects. What's going on?

651
00:44:47,345 --> 00:44:48,985
Orders to sanitize came down
from the Two Star.

652
00:44:49,105 --> 00:44:50,785
Okay, I'm countermanding.
Thank you. I'll take that.

653
00:44:50,905 --> 00:44:51,985
- Tell your guys to clear out.
- Who are you?

654
00:44:52,105 --> 00:44:53,625
This scene's part of
a federal investigation

655
00:44:53,745 --> 00:44:55,665
with national security ramifications.
This your log?

656
00:44:55,785 --> 00:44:57,265
- Yes, it is.
- Okay, my name is Agent Perez.

657
00:44:57,385 --> 00:44:58,305
You can take this up
with your superiors.

658
00:44:58,425 --> 00:44:59,505
- Clear the room!
- You guys move out.

659
00:44:59,585 --> 00:45:01,625
No gloves?
Get statements from everybody.

660
00:45:01,745 --> 00:45:02,905
- Yes, ma'am.
- And find out who this Two Star is.

661
00:45:03,025 --> 00:45:04,865
I mean, come on, really!

662
00:45:20,145 --> 00:45:22,385
Sir! We have a positive ID.

663
00:45:32,825 --> 00:45:33,945
Okay.

664
00:45:35,185 --> 00:45:37,665
The skin was pretty fried,
but we still managed to get

665
00:45:37,785 --> 00:45:41,585
a partial print that matches
to a Ranim Khalid.

666
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:46,025
He's a United States citizen, registered
Republican, and he owns a music store.

667
00:45:46,145 --> 00:45:48,465
- The guy's cleaner than lvory Snow.
- Got something here.

668
00:45:49,945 --> 00:45:51,945
- That's a bone mic.
- Hello.

669
00:45:52,025 --> 00:45:54,385
Military grade.
He didn't get that on eBay.

670
00:45:54,505 --> 00:45:56,185
Someone was talking to him.

671
00:46:26,545 --> 00:46:28,145
We have a cyber-terrorist here.

672
00:46:28,225 --> 00:46:30,265
Someone's already inside
our computer systems,

673
00:46:30,385 --> 00:46:34,945
hacking into the power grid,
traffic cams, automated cranes.

674
00:46:35,065 --> 00:46:37,505
There's no way the boy
and the girl did this alone.

675
00:47:08,505 --> 00:47:09,865
- Agent Zoe Perez?
- Yes.

676
00:47:09,945 --> 00:47:12,665
United States Air Force
Security Forces. Please come with us.

677
00:47:12,785 --> 00:47:14,705
- What's this about?
- Get in the car.

678
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,225
<i>Violence has broken out
in the Middle East as militants accuse</i>

679
00:47:19,345 --> 00:47:21,425
<i>the United States
of launching American missiles</i>

680
00:47:21,545 --> 00:47:25,585
<i>to demolish a village in Baluchistan,
killing innocent civilians.</i>

681
00:47:25,665 --> 00:47:28,945
<i>The attack has triggered a
series of retaliatory suicide bombings</i>

682
00:47:29,025 --> 00:47:31,185
<i>against American embassies abroad.</i>

683
00:47:31,305 --> 00:47:35,265
<i>Early reports indicate the American
death toll now stands at 56,</i>

684
00:47:35,705 --> 00:47:38,025
<i>with threats of further violence
here at home.</i>

685
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,505
<i>Officials...</i>

686
00:47:45,025 --> 00:47:46,985
What's he doing on a train, your kid?

687
00:47:48,025 --> 00:47:50,185
He goes to a music magnet.

688
00:47:50,265 --> 00:47:53,465
His school's on a tour of Washington.
They're playing at the Kennedy Center.

689
00:47:53,585 --> 00:47:57,145
Wow. That's big. And you just...

690
00:48:00,385 --> 00:48:02,425
Well, why'd you make that noise, "Huh"?

691
00:48:02,545 --> 00:48:03,985
I can't make noises now?

692
00:48:05,225 --> 00:48:07,345
- You think I should have gone.
- He's playing at the Kennedy Center.

693
00:48:07,425 --> 00:48:08,865
- That's kind of a big deal.
- It is a big deal.

694
00:48:08,985 --> 00:48:11,105
So I think maybe one parent
should have gone, that's all I'm saying.

695
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:12,745
Well, one parent had to work
while the other one does

696
00:48:12,825 --> 00:48:15,545
everything humanly possible
to bail on child support.

697
00:48:16,505 --> 00:48:19,265
But I don't expect you to know
a thing about responsibility.

698
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:22,705
You know, Rachel, you don't know
the first thing about me.

699
00:48:22,785 --> 00:48:24,265
I know your brother just died,
and whatever he was into

700
00:48:24,385 --> 00:48:26,425
- put my son's life at risk.
- I don't wanna talk about my brother.

701
00:48:26,545 --> 00:48:28,905
- Okay? I'm not kidding.
- I'm not kidding, either.

702
00:48:29,025 --> 00:48:30,905
Jesus, look what happened.

703
00:48:31,785 --> 00:48:33,425
Can you honestly say he had
nothing to do with this?

704
00:48:33,545 --> 00:48:35,345
I'm asking you not to talk about him!
Respect that.

705
00:48:35,425 --> 00:48:37,305
I'm asking you to be honest
with yourself. Your brother's a...

706
00:48:37,305 --> 00:48:37,865
I'm asking you to be honest
with yourself. Your brother's a...

707
00:48:57,305 --> 00:49:02,945
Hey! You can't just walk away!
You can't just leave!

708
00:49:03,465 --> 00:49:04,945
- Yes, I can.
- Now we have 15 minutes to get

709
00:49:05,065 --> 00:49:07,705
- wherever the hell we're going, all right?
- Yeah.

710
00:49:16,665 --> 00:49:17,945
I need you.

711
00:49:22,345 --> 00:49:23,985
I could've gone.

712
00:49:27,785 --> 00:49:29,105
I should have.

713
00:49:55,065 --> 00:49:59,265
<i>You are two minutes behind schedule.
Go to the alley behind the building.</i>

714
00:50:02,425 --> 00:50:05,785
<i>- Go to the armored truck.
- I don't see an armored truck.</i>

715
00:50:06,905 --> 00:50:08,225
There it is.

716
00:50:13,465 --> 00:50:17,185
<i>In 20 seconds, men will exit
the elevator. They will be armed.</i>

717
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:18,785
<i>One will be carrying a briefcase.</i>

718
00:50:18,905 --> 00:50:20,945
<i>Retrieve it from him,
then return to the van.</i>

719
00:50:21,065 --> 00:50:22,825
- This is insane. I'm not doing this.
- You want us to rob them?

720
00:50:22,905 --> 00:50:24,305
<i>You now have 15 seconds.</i>

721
00:50:27,385 --> 00:50:29,465
<i>Security. What's your emergency?</i>

722
00:50:34,065 --> 00:50:37,745
What are you doing?
I'm not robbing them. Shit.

723
00:50:49,305 --> 00:50:50,425
Put your gun on the floor.

724
00:50:50,545 --> 00:50:52,505
Put your gun on the floor! Look straight.

725
00:50:52,625 --> 00:50:54,465
You want me to blow his head off?
Put the gun on the ground!

726
00:50:54,585 --> 00:50:56,145
We don't wanna hurt you guys.
Just drop the case.

727
00:50:56,265 --> 00:50:57,505
Drop the case and kick it to her!

728
00:50:57,625 --> 00:50:59,265
Yeah, well, you're bringing a shit storm
on your head.

729
00:50:59,385 --> 00:51:01,225
Yeah, we're already in mid shit storm!
Now kick the case.

730
00:51:01,305 --> 00:51:02,705
Okay! Easy.

731
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:05,945
- Look straight.
- Okay, done.

732
00:51:06,065 --> 00:51:07,945
Kick it!

733
00:51:11,225 --> 00:51:12,145
Okay.

734
00:51:12,265 --> 00:51:13,785
- Don't even think about it!
- Back up.

735
00:51:13,905 --> 00:51:14,985
Easy.

736
00:51:17,425 --> 00:51:18,545
Back up.

737
00:51:18,665 --> 00:51:20,385
Walk over here, stand next to him,
and turn around.

738
00:51:20,505 --> 00:51:22,865
- Stand over here!
- Just take it easy.

739
00:51:24,145 --> 00:51:27,825
Turn around. Turn around. Turn around!

740
00:51:39,705 --> 00:51:41,225
Let's move, let's move!

741
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,105
Come on!

742
00:52:00,385 --> 00:52:01,865
Jerry! Here!

743
00:52:04,505 --> 00:52:05,625
Move, move!

744
00:52:08,665 --> 00:52:10,425
Freeze! Police!

745
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:12,785
Drop the gun! Drop the gun!

746
00:52:12,865 --> 00:52:14,065
We're security! We just got robbed!

747
00:52:14,185 --> 00:52:16,385
And there they are! We just got robbed!

748
00:52:19,985 --> 00:52:22,065
Move! Get out of the way!

749
00:52:22,745 --> 00:52:23,665
Move!

750
00:52:28,465 --> 00:52:30,705
Get out of the way! Out of the way!

751
00:52:30,785 --> 00:52:31,705
Move!

752
00:52:33,305 --> 00:52:35,745
- Hey, watch it, lady!
- Jerry, run!

753
00:52:36,225 --> 00:52:37,145
This way!

754
00:52:40,265 --> 00:52:41,785
- Out of the way!
- Come on!

755
00:52:41,905 --> 00:52:43,345
- Move out of the way!
- Move!

756
00:52:45,785 --> 00:52:47,345
You see that? This way.

757
00:53:00,465 --> 00:53:02,025
- You are Jerry Shaw?
- Yeah.

758
00:53:03,545 --> 00:53:06,345
Please come. Please.

759
00:53:06,465 --> 00:53:07,825
- Thank you.
- Please come in.

760
00:53:11,705 --> 00:53:12,625
Hi.

761
00:53:27,265 --> 00:53:29,465
- Wait. What is that?
- It's a timer.

762
00:53:29,985 --> 00:53:31,665
- For what?
- I don't know.

763
00:53:31,785 --> 00:53:34,105
The only things I can think of
with timers are microwaves and...

764
00:53:34,225 --> 00:53:35,785
And bombs.
You were gonna say bombs.

765
00:53:37,225 --> 00:53:39,825
- Coffeemakers have timers.
- Yeah, Jerry, it's a coffeemaker.

766
00:53:40,945 --> 00:53:42,185
That's great.

767
00:54:04,305 --> 00:54:06,105
We've mobilized every asset
we can get our hands on.

768
00:54:06,225 --> 00:54:07,985
So 12 more confirmed dead?

769
00:54:08,065 --> 00:54:09,185
Yes, sir.

770
00:54:10,385 --> 00:54:12,825
I want hourly sit reps
from General McKenna.

771
00:54:12,945 --> 00:54:15,665
There's a military base
37 miles from that port.

772
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:16,985
Scramble whatever you can.

773
00:54:17,105 --> 00:54:18,625
- Yes, sir.
- Come with me.

774
00:54:21,585 --> 00:54:23,625
Begging your pardon, sir,
but if you're thinking of taking me off

775
00:54:23,705 --> 00:54:25,785
- the Shaw investigation, I'd...
- Taking you off?

776
00:54:25,905 --> 00:54:28,785
Agent, for the first time
you're being brought onboard.

777
00:54:34,705 --> 00:54:38,225
Back to bus 30 minutes. Okay?
30 minutes.

778
00:54:43,225 --> 00:54:46,705
We're convinced a terrorist attack
on American soil is imminent.

779
00:54:46,785 --> 00:54:50,705
Over the past two days, we've received
over 200 terrorist threats.

780
00:54:50,825 --> 00:54:53,465
All starting the day
that Ethan Shaw died.

781
00:54:54,545 --> 00:54:59,505
An accident. Or not.
You're gonna help us find out.

782
00:55:02,105 --> 00:55:04,185
- Mr. Secretary.
- Gentlemen.

783
00:55:16,385 --> 00:55:19,505
- I didn't think that there was a 36th floor.
- Glad we can still keep some secrets.

784
00:55:30,385 --> 00:55:31,785
I want to know what's in the case.
Is it a bomb?

785
00:55:31,905 --> 00:55:34,345
<i>Go to Macy's.
Customer Service Department.</i>

786
00:55:34,425 --> 00:55:36,105

787

<i>You have 25 minutes

788
00:55:38,145 --> 00:55:40,425
<i>and then re-board the bus

789
00:55:40,505 --> 00:55:43,145
I'm done taking orders over the phone,
you understand?

790
00:55:48,585 --> 00:55:50,905
Well, that was quick. You done playing
this hide-and-go-seek bullshit?

791
00:55:51,025 --> 00:55:52,745
<i>We are not hiding, Jerry.</i>

00:57:34,512 --> 00:57:35,930
<i>We know who you are.</i>

822
00:57:36,055 --> 00:57:37,432
<i>... at least 30 minutes late.</i>

823
00:57:37,557 --> 00:57:39,142
<i>Sam doesn't care!</i>

824
00:57:39,225 --> 00:57:40,518
<i>We are everywhere.</i>

825
00:57:40,601 --> 00:57:42,395
What do you mean?
Why do you keep saying "we"?

826
00:57:42,937 --> 00:57:44,564
<i>We the people of the United States...</i>

827
00:57:45,273 --> 00:57:46,899
<i>And so, my fellow Americans...</i>

828
00:57:47,191 --> 00:57:50,987
<i>... in order to form a more perfect union,</i>

829
00:57:51,112 --> 00:57:52,947
<i>establish justice,</i>

830
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:55,158
<i>insure domestic tranquility,</i>

831
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:57,368
<i>provide for the common defense...</i>

832
00:57:57,452 --> 00:57:58,745
<i>All programmed options...</i>

833
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:00,079
<i>- Programmed options?
- ... sector searches,</i>

834
00:58:00,121 --> 00:58:04,375
<i>and downloaded points of data
will lead to this central command.</i>

835
00:58:05,752 --> 00:58:07,086
You're a computer.

836
00:58:08,129 --> 00:58:10,214
Say hello to our
Autonomous Reconnaissance

837
00:58:10,339 --> 00:58:12,633
Intelligence Integration Analyst.

838
00:58:13,342 --> 00:58:15,511
We call her Aria.

839
00:58:19,807 --> 00:58:23,102
She crunches all our raw intel,
finds patterns,

840
00:58:23,186 --> 00:58:25,354
helps predict the movement
of possible suspects,

841
00:58:25,438 --> 00:58:29,358
right down to behavior, motivation,
even personality.

842
00:58:31,527 --> 00:58:34,614
<i>Transferring primary search function
to auxiliary display.</i>

843
00:58:35,364 --> 00:58:38,868
<i>- Hello, Secretary Callister.
- Aria.</i>

844
00:58:39,285 --> 00:58:43,247
Agent Zoe Perez, Air Force OSI.
You are to assist her

845
00:58:43,331 --> 00:58:47,085
<i>- in her investigation of Ethan Shaw.
- Yes, Mr. Secretary.</i>

846
00:58:48,127 --> 00:58:52,298
<i>Hello, Agent Perez. Perez, Zoe.
Middle name: Soledad.</i>

847
00:58:52,423 --> 00:58:55,676
<i>Official service records indicate
your field reports are very thorough,</i>

848
00:58:55,802 --> 00:58:57,178
<i>if poorly formatted.</i>

849
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:02,183
<i>Please excuse us.

00:59:02,308 --> 00:59:05,228
<i>valid threat at Los Angeles

851
00:59:05,311 --> 00:59:07,939
<i>Alerting airport authorities
and local police.</i>

852
00:59:08,022 --> 00:59:10,525
Those gold spheres send her
infrared data,

853
00:59:10,608 --> 00:59:12,902
any communication intercepts
that she flags a threat.

854
00:59:13,778 --> 00:59:16,572
She analyzes it and tells us
what to pay attention to.

855
00:59:19,367 --> 00:59:21,994
<i>Dispatch to Terrorism Task Force.
Threat at LAX.</i>

856
00:59:22,078 --> 00:59:23,788
We're still beta-testing,

857
00:59:24,038 --> 00:59:25,998
but I'm pushing to get her online sooner.

858
00:59:31,295 --> 00:59:35,716
Mr. Secretary? A call for you.

859
00:59:36,634 --> 00:59:38,511
- Try to keep up.
- Yes, sir.

860
00:59:39,178 --> 00:59:41,347
And find out about Shaw.

861
00:59:41,431 --> 00:59:43,015
- Major.
- Sir?

862
00:59:48,938 --> 00:59:51,941
<i>Your profile reveals a pathological
aversion to conformity,</i>

863
00:59:52,066 --> 00:59:54,986
<i>education, career, even voting.</i>

864
00:59:55,236 --> 00:59:57,321
<i>Therefore, we conclude
that extreme coercion</i>

865
00:59:57,447 --> 00:59:58,990
<i>is necessary to motivate you.</i>

866
00:59:59,073 --> 01:00:01,826
<i>Unlike your brother Ethan,
who was self-motivated.</i>

867
01:00:01,909 --> 01:00:03,870
How do you know my brother?
He worked in a press office.

868
01:00:03,995 --> 01:00:06,497
<i>His employment there was a cover.</i>

869
01:00:06,581 --> 01:00:09,709
<i>Everyone in counterintelligence
operations has one.</i>

870
01:00:10,752 --> 01:00:14,839
Ethan was a Minuteman, just like me.
Army, Navy, Air Force.

871
01:00:14,922 --> 01:00:17,175
Every branch of the military had
a Minuteman posted here

872
01:00:17,258 --> 01:00:22,096
for a 12-hour shift, just in case she
flags a threat, and monitor hardware.

873
01:00:22,221 --> 01:00:27,268
The night Ethan died, he left this post
three minutes early.

874
01:00:27,351 --> 01:00:30,229
Now, you don't do that. Ever.

875
01:00:30,772 --> 01:00:33,733
<i>You are both required
to complete a task.</i>

876
01:00:33,816 --> 01:00:36,360
<i>- What?
- The protection of our national security.</i>

877
01:00:36,486 --> 01:00:38,780
<i>The Constitution allows for civilians
to be recruited</i>

878
01:00:38,863 --> 01:00:40,156
<i>- for the national defense.
- I'm done.</i>

879
01:00:40,281 --> 01:00:42,241
I'm done. You don't know me!
You don't know my brother!

880
01:00:42,366 --> 01:00:45,244
This is bullshit! I'm not serving
in the goddamn national defense!

881
01:00:45,328 --> 01:00:48,039
<i>We know all about him, Jerry. And you.</i>

882
01:00:49,415 --> 01:00:51,876
<i>Before he was a year old,
Ethan walked.</i>

883
01:00:52,627 --> 01:00:55,546
<i>The same task took you
18 months to accomplish.</i>

884
01:00:57,715 --> 01:00:58,966
<i>- How did you get this?
- Look at Ethan.</i>

885
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:01,302
<i>They were uploaded
from his home computer.</i>

886
01:01:01,427 --> 01:01:03,930
<i>You want to come over here, sweetie?
Come on over here with Ethan.</i>

887
01:01:04,013 --> 01:01:06,516
<i>- Jerry! Birthday cake. Let's go.
- Ethan had these?</i>

888
01:01:06,641 --> 01:01:07,892
<i>Come on, let's blow out the candles.</i>

889
01:01:07,975 --> 01:01:09,685
<i>Just for a little bit.</i>

890
01:01:09,769 --> 01:01:13,773
<i>Although you're identical in appearance,
you lack the motivation and talent</i>

891
01:01:13,856 --> 01:01:15,942
<i>- that enabled Ethan to excel.
- ... Jerry, come on.</i>

892
01:01:16,067 --> 01:01:17,735
<i>- Stop it.
- Do it like Ethan did.</i>

893
01:01:17,819 --> 01:01:21,531
<i>You're different from Ethan
in every way, except one.</i>

894
01:01:21,656 --> 01:01:23,616
<i>Jerry, let your brother help you. Jerry!</i>

895
01:01:23,658 --> 01:01:27,620
<i>You now have 14 minutes to change
your appearance and return to the bus.</i>

896
01:01:36,754 --> 01:01:38,714
We have 14 minutes.

897
01:01:45,263 --> 01:01:47,265
These couriers were hired
by Halloway-Smith

898
01:01:47,348 --> 01:01:49,976
- to transport some sort of case.
- The chemical company?

899
01:01:50,059 --> 01:01:53,062
Yes, exactly. Now, whatever was
in that case, Shaw now has.

900
01:01:53,146 --> 01:01:54,564
They went right for the case.

901
01:01:54,689 --> 01:01:59,110
Give us a minute, will you? We need
to know exactly what was in that case.

902
01:01:59,193 --> 01:02:02,196
They never tell you what's in the case.
I mean, it could Bubonic Plague.

903
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,490
- Could be Grandpa's Viagra.
- You know anything?

904
01:02:04,615 --> 01:02:05,908
- What?
- Anything at all?

905
01:02:06,617 --> 01:02:08,619
- What about these guns?
- What about them?

906
01:02:08,703 --> 01:02:09,996
It was a pump-action Remington 870.

907
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:12,957
Yeah, I know what kind of guns they are.
Get me a gun.

908
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,500
How were they holding them?
Get me a gun!

909
01:02:14,542 --> 01:02:15,918
What the hell do you mean,
how were they holding them?

910
01:02:16,002 --> 01:02:18,504
I mean, in what position
were they holding the gun?

911
01:02:18,629 --> 01:02:20,923
- For instance, like this?
- Hey, hey, hey.

912
01:02:21,007 --> 01:02:22,341
- Put that damned thing down!
- Or like in a music video,

913
01:02:22,425 --> 01:02:23,593
- or something like that?
- Hey, hey, hey!

914
01:02:23,718 --> 01:02:24,677
- Put it down!
- They weren't pros!

915
01:02:24,802 --> 01:02:25,887
Okay, that's what I was asking you.

916
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:27,346
So they didn't know
how to handle a weapon.

917
01:02:27,472 --> 01:02:28,556
- No.
- All right.

918
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:30,433
Get what you can
out of Batman and Robin here.

919
01:02:30,558 --> 01:02:32,226
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

920
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:35,021
We just checked cameras.
They said Shaw fired at one...

921
01:02:35,062 --> 01:02:37,774
Don't tell me.
Everything magically went black.

922
01:03:01,005 --> 01:03:03,341
Hi, my name's Thomas Morgan.
I'm with the FBI.

923
01:03:03,424 --> 01:03:06,260
<i>- Are your cameras on a network?
- No, man.</i>

924
01:03:06,385 --> 01:03:09,013
- VCR's in the back.
- Well, I'm gonna need your tapes.

925
01:03:11,808 --> 01:03:12,767
Shit.

926
01:03:15,645 --> 01:03:16,562
Sam!

927
01:03:16,979 --> 01:03:19,023
<i>- Sam? Sam, where are you?
- Hey, Mom, I got your message.</i>

928
01:03:19,107 --> 01:03:20,399
<i>The train's awesome!</i>

929
01:03:20,483 --> 01:03:22,110
<i>- Sam, listen to me.
- Brian tried to burp the alphabet,</i>

930
01:03:22,235 --> 01:03:23,986
<i>- but he gagged when he got to "M."
- Listen to me.</i>

931
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:25,738
<i>Call you when I hit D.C. Bye, Mom.</i>

932
01:03:25,863 --> 01:03:28,157
<i>Your son left that message
60 seconds ago.</i>

933
01:03:28,449 --> 01:03:31,661
<i>You will see him again.
But there's something we require first.</i>

934
01:03:33,287 --> 01:03:35,748
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

935
01:03:40,628 --> 01:03:43,589
<i>- No.
- You will do it, or Sam will die.</i>

936
01:03:43,965 --> 01:03:46,175
<i>You have six minutes
to return to the bus.</i>

937
01:03:54,809 --> 01:03:57,145
- Ready?
- Here, you okay?

938
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,438
We should go.

939
01:04:02,358 --> 01:04:06,195
Sir, we got something.
Play this screen right here.

940
01:04:07,113 --> 01:04:10,116
Okay, freeze that. Now zoom in
on the front of the bus right there.

941
01:04:10,241 --> 01:04:11,534
- Put it up on the other monitor.
- Yes, sir.

942
01:04:11,659 --> 01:04:14,495
Now zoom in.
Zoom in on this point right here.

943
01:04:14,579 --> 01:04:16,289
Can we zoom in tighter than that?

944
01:04:18,666 --> 01:04:20,710
Okay, enhance that shot.

945
01:04:22,211 --> 01:04:24,338
That's our guy, that's Jerry Shaw.

946
01:04:25,423 --> 01:04:28,509
Zoom in right here on this spot.
Right there. The reflection.

947
01:04:28,593 --> 01:04:30,094
All right. All right.

948
01:04:30,219 --> 01:04:32,013
Right there. Hello, sweetheart.

949
01:04:32,138 --> 01:04:35,183
Okay, so we got
a white brunette female,

950
01:04:35,266 --> 01:04:37,393
mid to late 20s, approximately 5'9".

951
01:04:37,477 --> 01:04:39,187
Find me that chartered bus!

952
01:04:39,312 --> 01:04:42,857
Masako. M-A-S-A-K-O.
Sightseeing Tours.

953
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:43,858
What time did they get on?

954
01:04:49,864 --> 01:04:52,408
I'm sorry for what I said about Ethan.

955
01:05:00,875 --> 01:05:03,294
It's like he had a rocket
strapped to his back.

956
01:05:03,377 --> 01:05:05,755
And it wasn't his fault.
He was just that way.

957
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:08,341
And I was not that way.

958
01:05:10,218 --> 01:05:14,055
I was the complete opposite.
I was the brother with lead shoes.

959
01:05:16,224 --> 01:05:18,184
That was my role, I was good at it.

960
01:05:20,019 --> 01:05:22,814
And he'd always try to help me.
You know, "This is how you throw it."

961
01:05:22,897 --> 01:05:26,400
"Do it like this." "Write it like that."
"Put your foot here."

962
01:05:26,526 --> 01:05:29,987
Even with the small things.
Homework, chores, anything like that,

963
01:05:30,113 --> 01:05:31,697
he would handle it
and then say that I did it,

964
01:05:31,823 --> 01:05:36,077
just so my father would notice me.
That was Ethan.

965
01:05:43,292 --> 01:05:46,504
He never asked me for anything. Ever.

966
01:05:48,214 --> 01:05:53,136
And whatever this is, he was part of it.
I feel like he needs my help to finish it.

967
01:05:55,471 --> 01:05:56,806
I owe him that.

968
01:06:04,105 --> 01:06:07,191
<i>We are now approaching
Dayton International Airport.</i>

969
01:06:07,316 --> 01:06:12,321
<i>Please use caution as you exit the bus.
And don't forget any of your belongings.</i>

970
01:06:12,363 --> 01:06:13,406
<i>Thank you.</i>

971
01:06:14,907 --> 01:06:18,202
<i>Attention, passengers. Please do not
leave your luggage unattended.</i>

972
01:06:18,578 --> 01:06:20,872
<i>Unattended luggage is subject
to collection and search</i>

973
01:06:20,997 --> 01:06:24,167
<i>by the airport police.
Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

974
01:06:27,295 --> 01:06:29,046
Yes, I'm walking toward them now. Yes.

975
01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:32,717
Hey. These are from her.
Go to the ticketing machine.

976
01:06:32,842 --> 01:06:36,220
Use the credit card to get your tickets.
Then walk to Gate 1-C.

977
01:06:37,638 --> 01:06:38,890
They now have them.

978
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:45,772
That's a nice picture.

979
01:06:52,028 --> 01:06:55,031
Okay. I need you guys at every exit,
watching faces.

980
01:06:55,114 --> 01:06:56,783
Work the secure area first.

981
01:06:56,866 --> 01:06:58,242
Go to the tower, have them order

982
01:06:58,284 --> 01:07:00,661
a ground stop.
Don't change the departure boards.

983
01:07:00,787 --> 01:07:02,538
We don't want them to know
we're coming.

984
01:07:10,671 --> 01:07:14,008
Sir, can you please shut the cell phone
off? You cannot take it through.

985
01:07:14,092 --> 01:07:16,052
- FBI. Clear the way.
- FBI. Please step back.

986
01:07:21,307 --> 01:07:22,975
Please, there are others behind you.

987
01:07:23,059 --> 01:07:24,894
- Keep it moving.
- Shoes and hats off, please!

988
01:07:24,977 --> 01:07:27,980
- Shoes also, yes.
- Laptops should be out of their cases!

989
01:07:28,064 --> 01:07:30,316
You need to make sure your jackets
are off and screened separately.

990
01:07:30,441 --> 01:07:33,528
- Sir, step in the circle, please.
- Have boarding passes in hand, please!

991
01:07:33,611 --> 01:07:34,946
We need to move this line quickly.

992
01:07:35,071 --> 01:07:37,281
Sir, that needs to go through.

993
01:07:37,824 --> 01:07:40,451
Ma'am, anything in your pockets?
Move it along.

994
01:07:42,912 --> 01:07:44,789
Hats and shoes off, please!

995
01:07:44,872 --> 01:07:47,834
- Laptops should be out of your bags!
- All right, next in line, please.

996
01:07:47,959 --> 01:07:49,335
Have your tickets ready.

997
01:07:53,297 --> 01:07:57,051
- Ma'am? Hat and shoes go in the bin.
- Step through.

998
01:08:02,098 --> 01:08:03,057
Wait.

999
01:08:03,391 --> 01:08:08,354
Shoes and hats off, please!
Laptops should be out of their bags!

1000
01:08:19,615 --> 01:08:20,616
Go ahead.

1001
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,243
Please move to the back
and let the air crew go first.

1002
01:08:22,368 --> 01:08:25,621
Step through, ma'am.
Boarding pass, please. Thank you.

1003
01:08:25,705 --> 01:08:27,081
Have your tickets ready.

1004
01:08:27,206 --> 01:08:28,791
- Have a safe trip.
- Thank you.

1005
01:08:28,916 --> 01:08:32,295
- All right, let's move forward. Next.
- She changed the screen.

1006
01:08:32,378 --> 01:08:35,298
Lay it down flat inside the bin.

1007
01:08:37,216 --> 01:08:40,970
- Please have boarding pass in hand!
- Right over here, ma'am.

1008
01:08:41,053 --> 01:08:43,473
Laptops should be out of their bags!

1009
01:08:56,861 --> 01:08:59,530
FBI! Out of the way!

1010
01:08:59,655 --> 01:09:01,741
Out of the way, out of the way!
Move, move!

1011
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:03,868
Move!

1012
01:09:11,709 --> 01:09:14,045
- Everybody, get down!
- Over here!

1013
01:09:15,254 --> 01:09:17,090
- Move, move!
- Oh, my God!

1014
01:09:17,757 --> 01:09:20,051
Stay down! Get out of the way!

1015
01:09:29,811 --> 01:09:30,895
- Sir, sir, sir!
- Yes?

1016
01:09:30,937 --> 01:09:33,356
I need your help. I'm sorry. Come here!

1017
01:09:36,859 --> 01:09:38,027
Thank you.

1018
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:54,168
Hey, you aren't supposed to be in here!

1019
01:10:23,448 --> 01:10:24,949
Go, go, go!

1020
01:11:17,001 --> 01:11:17,960
Move!

1021
01:12:36,038 --> 01:12:37,832
<i>Set the briefcase down.</i>

1022
01:12:46,549 --> 01:12:47,800
<i>Open it.</i>

1023
01:12:49,594 --> 01:12:52,013
<i>Load a vial into each syringe
and inject yourselves.</i>

1024
01:12:52,096 --> 01:12:54,599
<i>- What is it?
- An experimental heart drug.</i>

1025
01:12:54,724 --> 01:12:56,559
<i>- The cargo hold is unpressurized.
- Take this.</i>

1026
01:12:56,684 --> 01:12:59,979
<i>The injections will lower your heart rate,
reducing your need for oxygen.</i>

1027
01:13:00,062 --> 01:13:01,022
No.

1028
01:13:02,315 --> 01:13:04,025
- Roll your sleeve up.
- No, I can't do this.

1029
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:05,151
Roll your...

1030
01:13:05,234 --> 01:13:06,736
No! No, no, no, I can't.

1031
01:13:06,819 --> 01:13:09,405
<i>- We have to. Ready?
- You have a 92% chance of survival.</i>

1032
01:13:09,489 --> 01:13:10,740
- No.
- We have to.

1033
01:13:10,865 --> 01:13:13,201
<i>Do it now, or you will suffocate.</i>

1034
01:13:15,828 --> 01:13:16,746
Okay.

1035
01:13:17,163 --> 01:13:18,664
<i>Get in the crate.</i>

1036
01:13:18,790 --> 01:13:19,874
No. No.

1037
01:13:21,417 --> 01:13:25,213
- No, no. Oh, God.
- Stop it. Stop it.

1038
01:13:29,634 --> 01:13:30,676
Why is that plane on the runway?

1039
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:33,846
Shit, the military's cleared to
override a terminal lockdown.

1040
01:13:33,971 --> 01:13:35,306
Okay, I want you to work with the FAA.

1041
01:13:35,431 --> 01:13:38,768
I want to know what's in that plane
and where it's going.

1042
01:13:44,399 --> 01:13:46,109
- Oh, my God.
- You'll be all right.

1043
01:13:46,234 --> 01:13:48,111
Just talk to me.
We just gotta talk it through.

1044
01:13:48,236 --> 01:13:50,279
- Okay.
- Just tell me anything.

1045
01:13:51,572 --> 01:13:53,950
Anything you'd never rationally
tell a stranger.

1046
01:13:54,033 --> 01:13:55,243
You're being sweet, but it's not working.

1047
01:13:55,368 --> 01:13:57,412
Just tell me anything. Your ex-husband.

1048
01:13:57,495 --> 01:13:59,831
- You didn't tell me about him.
- Okay, you're gonna distract me by

1049
01:13:59,914 --> 01:14:01,290
bringing up the biggest mistake
of my life?

1050
01:14:01,374 --> 01:14:03,584
It can't be the biggest mistake.
You got your child out of it.

1051
01:14:03,709 --> 01:14:04,669
- You know? You got Sam out of it.
- Yeah, yeah,

1052
01:14:04,794 --> 01:14:06,879
now you're gonna distract me
by bringing up

1053
01:14:06,921 --> 01:14:09,924
- the one thing I'm most afraid of losing.
- Oh, God, you're hard to please.

1054
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,051
I'm sorry.

1055
01:14:13,511 --> 01:14:17,473
Is your son handsome?
Yeah? What's he look like?

1056
01:14:19,725 --> 01:14:21,561
- You got a picture?
- Yeah.

1057
01:14:21,644 --> 01:14:23,229
Well, let me see.

1058
01:14:25,857 --> 01:14:27,984
- There he is.
- The tooth grew in.

1059
01:14:28,067 --> 01:14:30,111
- I hope so.
- It's an old picture.

1060
01:14:31,112 --> 01:14:32,029
See? You're a good influence.

1061
01:14:32,113 --> 01:14:35,241
He plays an instrument.
He's got a happy face. He's got teeth.

1062
01:14:36,284 --> 01:14:38,661
You beat yourself up for no reason.

1063
01:14:40,455 --> 01:14:42,665
Let's keep going.
What's the husband's name?

1064
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:44,500
- Ex.
- Ex-husband. What's his name?

1065
01:14:44,625 --> 01:14:47,086
- Craig.
- Craig sounds like a shithead.

1066
01:14:47,211 --> 01:14:48,796
He is a shithead.

1067
01:14:49,547 --> 01:14:52,842
I mean, every year he forgets
his own son's birthday.

1068
01:14:53,259 --> 01:14:56,053
Really? That sucks.

1069
01:14:58,806 --> 01:15:01,517
I mean, after I kicked his ass out,

1070
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:06,105
I was so scared
I didn't know what I was gonna do.

1071
01:15:10,151 --> 01:15:11,986
And then this one night,

1072
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:16,616
I went into Sam's room,
he was, like, three months old,

1073
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:21,621
and there he was, just smiling at me.

1074
01:15:22,622 --> 01:15:24,332
And that little face...

1075
01:15:28,961 --> 01:15:31,964
And I was, like, I'm gonna do this.
I can do this.

1076
01:15:33,341 --> 01:15:35,051
Whatever it takes.

1077
01:15:43,309 --> 01:15:47,021
I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna disappoint you.

1078
01:15:51,901 --> 01:15:54,529
Aria, would you please bring up
the video log

1079
01:15:54,612 --> 01:15:56,155
of the night Ethan Shaw died?

1080
01:15:56,239 --> 01:16:01,285
<i>Sequencing video log 1137-Z.
Here you are, Major.</i>

1081
01:16:01,369 --> 01:16:03,704
See that?
He's leaving three minutes early,

1082
01:16:03,788 --> 01:16:06,582
and he's not even waiting
for logout confirmation.

1083
01:16:06,916 --> 01:16:09,210
- Can you play that again?
- Sure.

1084
01:16:12,797 --> 01:16:14,257
Did you see that?

1085
01:16:14,382 --> 01:16:16,092
With his cell phone.

1086
01:16:20,972 --> 01:16:23,015
Look, he's doing that on purpose.
Is that Morse code?

1087
01:16:23,099 --> 01:16:24,851
- Yeah.
- Here.

1088
01:16:33,317 --> 01:16:35,820
Why is he walking in circles
around the elevator?

1089
01:16:35,903 --> 01:16:38,239
<i>- Initiating video shutdown for analysis.
- No.</i>

1090
01:16:38,364 --> 01:16:40,950
No, Aria, wait.
Listen, I'm prioritizing this feed.

1091
01:16:41,033 --> 01:16:42,994
<i>- Stay with this.
- Apologies, Major Bowman.</i>

1092
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:44,537
<i>Critical data sectors
have been corrupted.</i>

1093
01:16:44,662 --> 01:16:46,497
Aria, this is important!
Stay with this feed!

1094
01:16:46,622 --> 01:16:47,915
<i>Video sequence erased.</i>

1095
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,334
Aria, go to the backups!
Do not erase this!

1096
01:16:50,376 --> 01:16:52,086
- It's a priority. You hear me?
- Bowman.

1097
01:16:52,211 --> 01:16:54,964
- Loop it. Whatever you have to do.
- Bowman.

1098
01:17:02,430 --> 01:17:04,724
It's the only place she can't see.

1099
01:17:05,975 --> 01:17:07,310
This way.

1100
01:17:22,742 --> 01:17:24,410
It's a memory card

1101
01:17:25,244 --> 01:17:27,455
<i>from Ethan's cell phone.</i>

1102
01:17:31,167 --> 01:17:33,169
<i>Aria, listen. You do not have
permission to exceed your authority</i>

1103
01:17:33,294 --> 01:17:35,713
<i>and act independently.
Do you understand?</i>

1104
01:17:52,897 --> 01:17:54,023
Let's go.

1105
01:18:15,378 --> 01:18:17,755
We got clearance to land
at the Pentagon.

1106
01:18:18,172 --> 01:18:19,090
Go ahead.

1107
01:18:19,215 --> 01:18:22,468
I'm at the Pentagon.
Ethan Shaw wasn't an adversary.

1108
01:18:22,552 --> 01:18:26,347
He wasn't even a Public Affairs officer.
He worked here, 36 floors underground.

1109
01:18:26,472 --> 01:18:28,182
He was working for
the Secretary of Defense.

1110
01:18:28,224 --> 01:18:29,767
<i>- The Secretary of Defense?
- Yes.</i>

1111
01:18:29,851 --> 01:18:31,561
<i>On a project called Eagle Eye.</i>

1112
01:18:31,644 --> 01:18:34,021
I just listened to a
message he left before he died.

1113
01:18:34,063 --> 01:18:35,064
It's big.

1114
01:18:35,148 --> 01:18:36,482
<i>I'm about to download...</i>

1115
01:18:38,943 --> 01:18:41,654
Perez? Perez!

1116
01:18:54,751 --> 01:18:56,210
Sir. Come with me.

1117
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:14,812
I have 10 minutes before
I'm sequestered

1118
01:19:14,937 --> 01:19:16,147
for the State of the Union.

1119
01:19:16,230 --> 01:19:17,690
<i>We really just need three minutes
of your time.</i>

1120
01:19:17,774 --> 01:19:19,442
<i>Is this about the
Ethan Shaw investigation?</i>

1121
01:19:19,567 --> 01:19:20,485
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1122
01:19:20,610 --> 01:19:24,113
<i>301 to 306. We are confirmed go
for a State of the Union lockdown.</i>

1123
01:19:41,089 --> 01:19:42,548
<i>Sir, all the threats we've been tracking,</i>

1124
01:19:42,632 --> 01:19:44,884
- the chatter, all of it...
- Hold it.

1125
01:19:57,605 --> 01:20:00,316
Ethan Shaw left three minutes early
to leave us a recording.

1126
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:01,651
To warn us.

1127
01:20:01,734 --> 01:20:03,111
<i>I'm ordering you to cease...</i>

1128
01:20:08,866 --> 01:20:10,410
<i>I'm ordering you to cease and desist.</i>

1129
01:20:10,493 --> 01:20:12,203
<i>Our abort
recommendation was contravened,</i>

1130
01:20:12,286 --> 01:20:14,997
<i>instigating retaliation against
American citizens.</i>

1131
01:20:15,123 --> 01:20:16,707
<i>- Aria...
- To prevent more bloodshed,</i>

1132
01:20:16,791 --> 01:20:19,419
<i>the Executive Branch must be removed.</i>

1133
01:20:19,502 --> 01:20:20,837
<i>No, Aria, listen to me.
You do not have permission</i>

1134
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,797
<i>to exceed your authority and act
independently, you understand?</i>

1135
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:25,007
<i>The Declaration
of Independence states,</i>

1136
01:20:25,133 --> 01:20:28,428
<i>"Whenever any form of government
becomes destructive to its own ends,</i>

1137
01:20:28,511 --> 01:20:30,513
<i>"it is the right of the people
to abolish it."</i>

1138
01:20:30,638 --> 01:20:32,223
<i>I know what it states.
You're not empowered to do this.</i>

1139
01:20:32,348 --> 01:20:33,975
<i>The chain of command

<i>- the chain of command itself.

1144
01:20:46,195 --> 01:20:48,906
<i>- Aria!
- Operation Guillotine is in effect.</i>

1145
01:20:50,533 --> 01:20:52,410
<i>First Lieutenant Ethan Shaw,
United States Air Force,</i>

1152
01:21:05,214 --> 01:21:06,257
Sir,

1153
01:21:07,508 --> 01:21:10,511
what abort recommendation
is Aria talking about?

1154
01:21:13,347 --> 01:21:15,933
Three days ago, we thought we had
Majid al-Khoei and a training camp

1155
01:21:16,058 --> 01:21:18,895
full of operatives.
But the intel was false.

1156
01:21:19,437 --> 01:21:21,230
Aria tried to stop us.

1157
01:21:21,856 --> 01:21:23,524
We got the wrong guy?

1158
01:21:52,011 --> 01:21:53,471
I'm gonna need a full lockdown
on this level.

1159
01:21:53,554 --> 01:21:56,557
No one gets in or out without
going through me first. You got it?

1160
01:21:56,599 --> 01:21:58,267
- Thank you.
- Sir, this is the only item

1161
01:21:58,351 --> 01:22:00,520
offloaded from the Dayton C-17.

1162
01:22:00,645 --> 01:22:02,146
Let me see that.

1163
01:22:03,106 --> 01:22:04,732
I need access to your 36th floor.

1164
01:22:04,857 --> 01:22:06,526
- We don't have a 36th floor.
- Yes, you do.

1165
01:22:06,651 --> 01:22:08,111
Get your commander
and tell him to meet us down there.

1166
01:22:08,236 --> 01:22:09,153
Come on, let's go.

1167

01:22:47,316 --> 01:22:49,610
<i>Take the stairs

1173
01:23:09,005 --> 01:23:12,216
<i>Rachel Holloman,
step away from Jerry Shaw.</i>

1174
01:23:16,971 --> 01:23:18,973
What's Operation Guillotine?

1175
01:23:20,016 --> 01:23:22,560
It's a simulation we run.
A terrorism drill.

1176
01:23:22,685 --> 01:23:23,686
How to keep the government going

1177
01:23:23,770 --> 01:23:26,689
in case the line of succession
were terminated.

1178
01:23:27,065 --> 01:23:29,317
And Shaw put a biometric lock on her,
to stop her.

1179
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:32,236
Right. And he's dead.

1180
01:23:33,488 --> 01:23:36,616
- So without Ethan Shaw, she's frozen.
- Right.

1181
01:23:38,659 --> 01:23:39,619
Wrong.

1182
01:23:40,203 --> 01:23:42,080
<i>Jerry Shaw, your next task.</i>

1183
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:44,832
<i>Approach the biometric scanner.</i>

1184
01:23:56,302 --> 01:23:58,096

<i>Sir, I need to trigger
an emergency shutdown.</i>

1190
01:24:16,531 --> 01:24:19,117
If this is right, we can't afford the risk.

1191
01:24:20,034 --> 01:24:21,077
Do it.

1192
01:24:32,588 --> 01:24:35,091
This is Secretary Callister.
There's been a malfunction in the vault.

1193
01:24:35,133 --> 01:24:36,467
Open the door.

1194
01:24:36,592 --> 01:24:39,011
<i>- Can anyone hear me?
- Yes, Mr. Secretary.</i>

1195
01:24:39,095 --> 01:24:40,721

1196
01:24:45,893 --> 01:24:47,562

<i>Kill Jerry Shaw now, then exit.

Do it.

1234
01:27:23,926 --> 01:27:25,136
I can't.

1235
01:27:27,472 --> 01:27:29,348
<i>You have failed to comply.</i>

01:28:05,885 --> 01:28:09,138
Come with me. Don't ask any questions.

1248
01:28:16,521 --> 01:28:17,688
Please.

1249
01:28:26,572 --> 01:28:28,699
- You got to let me talk to him.
- The kid had a gun.

1250
01:28:28,783 --> 01:28:30,618
The military has the ball now.

1251
01:28:30,701 --> 01:28:32,078
- Sir!
- I'll get the Attorney General involved.

1252
01:28:32,161 --> 01:28:34,872
Believe me, I will. 'Cause if it's not
you, I'm talking to somebody.

1253
01:28:34,956 --> 01:28:36,374
You don't understand
the possibilities here.

1254
01:28:36,457 --> 01:28:38,126
- What do you want?
- You need to listen. This is important.

1255
01:28:38,209 --> 01:28:41,087
Sixteen hours ago, a commercial
explosive went missing from

1256
01:28:41,170 --> 01:28:44,465
a testing site in Aberdeen.
The explosive is called Hex.

1257
01:28:44,590 --> 01:28:46,926
It's a crystal that detonates
on a sonic trigger.

1258
01:28:47,051 --> 01:28:48,261
- A crystal.
- Yes.

1259
01:28:48,761 --> 01:28:50,513
We're only talking about a small
amount that's missing...

1260
01:28:50,596 --> 01:28:52,056
Give me a ratio.

1261
01:28:52,473 --> 01:28:54,684
One crystal to a football field.

1262
01:28:57,103 --> 01:29:00,398
You couldn't have picked a worse time
to be of some goddamn use.

1263
01:29:07,488 --> 01:29:09,907
Please, just tell me where we're going.

1264
01:29:12,452 --> 01:29:15,621
I tracked the shipping on the trigger.
It was sent to the guy that we found

1265
01:29:15,747 --> 01:29:18,124
underneath the wires. Ranim Khalid.

1266
01:29:19,584 --> 01:29:21,878
- The music shop guy.
- Yes, exactly.

1267
01:29:23,921 --> 01:29:25,131
I'm not gonna let us go down in history

1268
01:29:25,256 --> 01:29:26,966
as the assholes who let
this thing happen.

1269
01:29:27,091 --> 01:29:29,719
Open the door!
You don't know what's about to happen!

1270
01:29:31,804 --> 01:29:33,556
Tom Morgan. The Attorney General

1271
01:29:33,598 --> 01:29:35,099
has authorized me to take him
in for questioning.

1272
01:29:35,183 --> 01:29:37,852
We're at threat level orange.
You guys gotta help me.

1273
01:29:37,935 --> 01:29:39,687
All right. Let him out.

1274
01:29:42,065 --> 01:29:43,649
Listen to me. Remember the voice
I was talking about?

1275
01:29:43,775 --> 01:29:46,152
Yeah, yeah, shut up! Thanks, guys.

1276
01:29:47,278 --> 01:29:51,449
I can get fired for this nine ways,
so button it or I'll turn us both in.

1277
01:30:07,048 --> 01:30:08,257
Follow me.

1278
01:30:12,553 --> 01:30:15,431
Hey, guys, here's one more for the
6:30 p.m. Capitol Limited.

1279
01:30:15,515 --> 01:30:17,016
All right, man.

1280
01:30:22,397 --> 01:30:24,440
Well, it's awfully cold outside.

1281
01:30:26,734 --> 01:30:28,611
Here's mine. Come on, let's go.

1282
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:30,530
- Mr. Miller!
- Yes.

1283
01:30:30,655 --> 01:30:33,282
- Hello, I'm Chris Carrick.
- Tom Donaldson.

1284
01:30:33,741 --> 01:30:35,618
We're from the White House.

1285
01:30:35,701 --> 01:30:37,245
- Something wrong?
- Not exactly.

1286
01:30:37,370 --> 01:30:39,497
There's been a change of plans.

1287
01:30:39,664 --> 01:30:41,040
How so?

1288
01:30:46,671 --> 01:30:49,215
This is for you.
She wants you to change.

1289
01:30:50,216 --> 01:30:53,511
Is that your family? Your parents?

1290
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:57,807
David, I bet you love them
as much as I love my son.

1291
01:30:59,016 --> 01:31:00,393
His name's Sam.

1292
01:31:01,602 --> 01:31:04,605
He's on a train.
Do you know anything about that?

1293
01:31:11,446 --> 01:31:13,489
Maybe we can help each other.

1294
01:31:16,075 --> 01:31:17,285
Please.

1295
01:31:19,328 --> 01:31:21,873
When you're done, she wants you
to use the Capitol subway system.

1296
01:31:21,956 --> 01:31:23,458
It's on the ground floor. I'm sorry.

1297
01:31:23,583 --> 01:31:25,042
- David. Please.
- No. Sorry.

1298
01:31:25,126 --> 01:31:26,961
You have three minutes.

1299
01:31:30,590 --> 01:31:31,674
Okay, I want to know everything.

1300
01:31:31,799 --> 01:31:34,010
The girl, the computer downstairs,
the Hex, everything.

1301
01:31:34,135 --> 01:31:35,470
- What's Hex?
- The crystal explosive.

1302
01:31:35,553 --> 01:31:36,763
- I don't know what that is.
- Don't bullshit me!

1303
01:31:36,888 --> 01:31:38,306
- I don't know what that is!
- Start talking! I wanna know!

1304
01:31:38,431 --> 01:31:40,224
I swear I don't know what you're
talking about! Listen to me!

1305
01:31:40,308 --> 01:31:41,392
The computer's tracking us right now!

1306
01:31:41,476 --> 01:31:42,435
Take this stuff
and throw it out the window!

1307
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:44,353
- What are you talking about?
- You need to take your cell phone,

1308
01:31:44,896 --> 01:31:48,149
your pager, your walkie, anything that
gets a signal, throw it out the window.

1309
01:32:03,748 --> 01:32:06,375
It's gone off! Get down!
Power it down!

1310
01:32:08,002 --> 01:32:09,712
- What the hell's going on?
- System control's locked out.

1311
01:32:12,131 --> 01:32:14,050
I need a vector and a fighter now.

1312
01:32:14,509 --> 01:32:16,761
Viper One, we have a positive ID
on an MQ9 Reaper.

1313
01:32:16,886 --> 01:32:19,055
<i>Snap vector 230 to 132.</i>

1314
01:32:19,180 --> 01:32:20,515
<i>You are authorized to go weapons hot.</i>

1315
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:23,142
<i>Roger, Northcom.
I have a visual on the Reaper.</i>

1316
01:32:28,648 --> 01:32:30,691
<i>One to Base, One to Base!
Ejection has been initiated.</i>

1317
01:32:30,733 --> 01:32:32,860
<i>I don't have control! I don't have...</i>

1318
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:35,738
There's a target list.
President, Vice President.

1319
01:32:35,863 --> 01:32:37,490
- There's like twelve people on the list.
- Jesus.

1320
01:32:37,573 --> 01:32:38,991
The State of the Union's in 20 minutes.

1321
01:32:39,117 --> 01:32:40,493
The screen said
"wireless detonator activated."

1322
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:41,828
- What about the girl?
- She kept the girl alive

1323
01:32:41,911 --> 01:32:43,037
- for a reason, I don't know.
- The explosive

1324
01:32:43,162 --> 01:32:44,455
is detonated by sonic trigger.

1325
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:45,915
It was sent to the guy who got fried.

1326
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:47,041
He owns an instrument store.

1327
01:32:47,166 --> 01:32:48,543
Does any of that stuff
make any sense to you?

1328
01:32:48,626 --> 01:32:50,711
Rachel's kid plays the trumpet.

1329
01:33:05,727 --> 01:33:07,395
Come on, we gotta go.

1330
01:33:09,105 --> 01:33:10,189
Get out of the car!

1331
01:33:10,273 --> 01:33:11,691
Get out of the car!

1332
01:33:12,108 --> 01:33:13,234
FBI!

1333
01:33:21,159 --> 01:33:23,035
Over there, that tunnel.

1334
01:33:34,338 --> 01:33:35,256
Shit!

1335
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:10,666
Here. You're gonna need this.

1336
01:34:18,216 --> 01:34:19,383
Okay, listen to me.

1337
01:34:19,509 --> 01:34:21,719
The Library of Congress,
there's a tunnel there.

1338
01:34:21,844 --> 01:34:25,431
It'll get you to the Capitol.
Find the Sergeant at Arms.

1339
01:34:25,848 --> 01:34:27,308
Tell him you have a POTUS 111.

1340
01:34:27,433 --> 01:34:28,684
- What?
- POTUS 111.

1341
01:34:28,810 --> 01:34:31,979
- It's a threat to the President.
- I understand. POTUS 111.

1342
01:34:36,567 --> 01:34:39,404
Now get out of here.
That thing's coming back.

1343
01:34:42,115 --> 01:34:44,117
Go! Go!

1344
01:35:58,691 --> 01:36:00,359
Okay, watch your step.

1345
01:36:00,485 --> 01:36:02,987
Come on down. Here we go.
Come on out. Come on.

1346
01:36:03,071 --> 01:36:05,073
- It's so cool!
- Come on, hurry!

1347
01:36:05,156 --> 01:36:07,075
Guys, it's so cool! Come on, let's go.

1348
01:36:18,377 --> 01:36:21,172
- Library of Congress!
- Hey, get outta here!

1349
01:36:32,308 --> 01:36:33,726
Miss Crowley?

1350
01:36:34,310 --> 01:36:36,312
Miss Crowley. Welcome to the Capitol.

1351
01:36:36,813 --> 01:36:38,523
Senator McDonnell's office said
that you'd be running late.

1352
01:36:38,648 --> 01:36:41,234
- I'll take you to your seat.
- Thank you.

1353
01:36:43,903 --> 01:36:46,614
Aria, why am I being spared?

1354
01:36:46,739 --> 01:36:49,075
<i>Our abort recommendation was ignored,</i>

1355
01:36:49,158 --> 01:36:51,911
<i>triggering violent retaliations against
American citizens</i>

1356
01:36:51,994 --> 01:36:55,665
<i>with no predictable end.
Regime change is the only solution.</i>

1357
01:36:56,290 --> 01:36:57,667
<i>You will lead
the new command structure</i>

1358
01:36:57,792 --> 01:36:59,961
<i>as President of the United States.</i>

1359
01:37:04,257 --> 01:37:06,592
- Help me. Pull these out.
- What are these?

1360
01:37:06,676 --> 01:37:08,261
Her memory blocks.

1361
01:37:08,344 --> 01:37:10,596
This will slow her down,
but her central operating system

1362
01:37:10,721 --> 01:37:11,764
is up on the gantry.

1363
01:37:11,848 --> 01:37:14,934
<i>Warning. Please replace
memory blocks A through F.</i>

1364
01:37:15,059 --> 01:37:17,812
It's like her brain.
Protected by liquid nitrogen.

1365
01:37:17,937 --> 01:37:19,897
We drain it and she'll fry.

1366
01:37:25,445 --> 01:37:26,738
Hey, you can't go in!

1367
01:37:26,863 --> 01:37:28,239
Tom Morgan, FBI. JTTF.

1368
01:37:28,322 --> 01:37:30,324
I have a possible POTUS 111.
Let me in the building.

1369
01:37:31,617 --> 01:37:33,327
Okay, everybody! Everybody!

1370
01:37:33,911 --> 01:37:35,580
Can I have your attention, please?

1371
01:37:35,705 --> 01:37:38,958
Saxophones, remember shorter
on those quarter notes.

1372
01:37:39,333 --> 01:37:41,878
And when we get to the crescendo,

1373
01:37:41,961 --> 01:37:45,590
"land of the free," hold that high F.

1374
01:37:45,673 --> 01:37:47,008
And smile.

1375
01:37:47,133 --> 01:37:50,636
Okay? It's not every day
you get to play for the President!

1376
01:38:08,613 --> 01:38:11,824
Here we are.
And anything else, Miss Crowley?

1377
01:38:11,908 --> 01:38:13,201
No, thanks.

1378
01:38:32,345 --> 01:38:35,515
Madam Speaker,
the President's Cabinet!

1379
01:38:48,194 --> 01:38:49,654
POTUS 111!
There's a bomb in the building!

1380
01:38:49,779 --> 01:38:51,531
Stop! No entry! No exceptions!

1381
01:38:51,656 --> 01:38:54,659
Tom Morgan, FBI. Back up.
Give me your cuffs.

1382
01:38:54,742 --> 01:38:56,119
- Give me your cuffs!
- Take it easy!

1383
01:38:56,202 --> 01:38:57,537
- Give me your cuffs.
- I'm reaching for them.

1384
01:38:57,620 --> 01:38:59,330
I'm reaching for them.

1385
01:39:13,136 --> 01:39:14,595
Madam Speaker,

1386
01:39:18,224 --> 01:39:20,727
the President of the United States!

1387
01:39:31,279 --> 01:39:32,613
<i>Data corruption at critical risk.</i>

1388
01:39:35,616 --> 01:39:38,703
<i>You are now in violation of
national security protocol.</i>

1389
01:39:43,791 --> 01:39:46,669
<i>Seeking available options.</i>

1390
01:39:48,087 --> 01:39:51,716
<i>Uploading to offsite satellite.</i>

1391
01:39:52,091 --> 01:39:54,594
<i>- Data upload: 3%.
- Bowman?</i>

1392
01:39:54,886 --> 01:39:56,763
- What is she doing?
- She's trying to back up her memory

1393
01:39:56,888 --> 01:39:58,890
and send it somewhere else!

1394
01:40:00,183 --> 01:40:02,060
<i>- 5%.
- Bowman!</i>

1395
01:40:03,603 --> 01:40:04,771
Bowman!

1396
01:40:10,526 --> 01:40:11,903
<i>8%.</i>

1397
01:40:16,282 --> 01:40:18,701
<i>Over the past three days, 19 Americans</i>

1398
01:40:19,702 --> 01:40:22,246
<i>have lost their lives to brutal
acts of terror...</i>

1399
01:40:22,371 --> 01:40:24,165
<i>- Tunnel secure.
- ... and hate.</i>

1400
01:40:25,124 --> 01:40:29,504
But I say to you tonight
that our hearts may be broken,

1401
01:40:30,004 --> 01:40:32,632
but our spirit will never be broken!

1402
01:40:38,679 --> 01:40:40,848
<i>Data upload, 17%.</i>

1403
01:40:42,725 --> 01:40:44,227
<i>19%.</i>

1404
01:40:46,104 --> 01:40:50,191
<i>Perez, Zoe, you are now classified
as an enemy of the state.</i>

1405
01:40:51,692 --> 01:40:53,111
<i>23%.</i>

1406
01:40:53,444 --> 01:40:54,779
<i>25%.</i>

1407
01:41:06,290 --> 01:41:09,669
<i>27%. Operation Guillotine is in effect.</i>

1408
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:13,047
<i>It was nearly 200 years ago,</i>

1409
01:41:13,172 --> 01:41:15,925
<i>in the War of 1812,
that Francis Scott Key</i>

1410
01:41:16,050 --> 01:41:20,513
found himself stuck on a truce ship
during the shelling of Fort McHenry.

1411
01:41:20,638 --> 01:41:22,974
We lost some lives then, too.

1412
01:41:24,058 --> 01:41:27,770
But our flag still flew high and proud.

1413
01:41:27,895 --> 01:41:31,065
And his admiration became our anthem.

1414
01:41:31,357 --> 01:41:33,025
With us tonight is the Youth Orchestra

1415
01:41:33,151 --> 01:41:36,279
of the Barrow School
from Hyde Park, Illinois.

1416
01:41:36,529 --> 01:41:37,613
Sam.

1417
01:41:38,197 --> 01:41:40,074
Let us stand together,

1418
01:41:40,575 --> 01:41:44,370
as they raise our spirits every inch
as high as that flag

1419
01:41:44,871 --> 01:41:48,958
to show that our union
is still as strong as ever.

1420
01:42:06,642 --> 01:42:09,979
<i>Oh, say can you see</i>

1421
01:42:10,063 --> 01:42:14,192
<i>by the dawn's early light</i>

1422
01:42:14,275 --> 01:42:18,571
<i>What so proudly we hailed</i>

1423
01:42:18,696 --> 01:42:22,742
<i>at the twilight's last gleaming?</i>

1424
01:42:23,201 --> 01:42:27,246
<i>Whose broad stripes and bright stars...</i>

1425
01:42:29,165 --> 01:42:31,000
Sergeant at Arms?

1426
01:42:33,669 --> 01:42:35,171
Hey. Hey.

1427
01:43:22,343 --> 01:43:24,053
Get out, get out.

1428
01:43:24,929 --> 01:43:25,847
Mom!

1429
01:43:49,829 --> 01:43:53,458
Jerry, all right, you did it!
Come on. Yeah, Jerry!

1430
01:43:53,583 --> 01:43:56,335
<i>There are still no named suspects
in the attack on the Blair Tunnel</i>

1431
01:43:56,419 --> 01:43:58,254
<i>and the attacks in the Capitol Building.</i>

1432
01:43:58,337 --> 01:44:01,132
<i>And there is still no word on the
involvement of Jerry Damon Shaw.</i>

1433
01:44:01,215 --> 01:44:04,385
<i>... huge assassination attempt,

1434
01:44:04,510 --> 01:44:07,013
<i>no suspects identified
or even arrested...</i>

1435
01:44:07,096 --> 01:44:09,474
<i>... any idea who is responsible
for what may be</i>

1436
01:44:09,599 --> 01:44:11,350
<i>the largest-scale
cyber-terror attack that's</i>

1437
01:44:11,476 --> 01:44:13,019
<i>ever been mounted in the United States.</i>

<i>internal security breach

1442
01:44:20,651 --> 01:44:22,945
The Aria project has been
decommissioned

1443
01:44:23,071 --> 01:44:26,365
and all those involved
rotated to other assignments.

1444
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:29,952
Mr. Secretary,
we can't just stop intelligence-gathering

1445
01:44:29,994 --> 01:44:32,371
just because of what happened here.

1446
01:44:34,290 --> 01:44:35,958
No, we can't.

1447
01:44:36,042 --> 01:44:38,753
All I know is we made
a great many mistakes.

1448
01:44:39,504 --> 01:44:42,548
And good people
paid the ultimate price for them.

1449
01:44:43,132 --> 01:44:45,635
<i>And that's a debt we can't ever repay.</i>

1450
01:44:46,677 --> 01:44:48,679
<i>But we can honor it.</i>

1451
01:44:51,099 --> 01:44:53,893
<i>And we can let their sacrifice remind us</i>

1452
01:44:54,936 --> 01:44:56,813
<i>that sometimes</i>

1453
01:44:56,896 --> 01:45:00,441
<i>the very measures we put into place
to safeguard our liberty</i>

1454
01:45:01,359 --> 01:45:04,153
<i>become threats to liberty itself.</i>

1455
01:45:27,719 --> 01:45:29,137
- Hey, little guy.
- Jerry!

1456
01:45:29,262 --> 01:45:31,180
Look at you, looking older.
How are you?

1457
01:45:31,305 --> 01:45:32,598
- Good.
- Happy birthday.

1458
01:45:32,682 --> 01:45:34,100
It's Rock Band! Is that for me?

1459
01:45:34,225 --> 01:45:36,519
No, this is so your
mom can practice her drumming.

1460
01:45:36,644 --> 01:45:38,062
It is for you. Happy birthday.

1461
01:45:38,146 --> 01:45:40,022
- Wow!
- Sam, what do you say?

1462
01:45:40,106 --> 01:45:41,524
- Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.

1463
01:45:41,649 --> 01:45:43,359
Guys, look, it's Rock Band!

1464
01:45:43,484 --> 01:45:45,361
- Cool, let's go.
- Awesome!

1465
01:45:52,201 --> 01:45:53,995
- Sorry, I was late. I was...
- Thank you

1466
01:45:54,120 --> 01:45:55,496
for remembering.

1467
01:45:56,873 --> 01:45:57,790
Yeah.

1468
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:08,968
I'm glad you're here.

1469
01:46:09,761 --> 01:46:10,928
Me, too.
