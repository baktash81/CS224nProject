1
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:57,711
- Do I have to eat any more of this?
- DefiniteIy.

2
00:01:57,795 --> 00:02:01,549
Spinach is very rich in vitamins.
I might say disgustingIy rich.

3
00:02:01,632 --> 00:02:05,428
And very good for you, Miss Barbara.

4
00:02:05,512 --> 00:02:08,640
Why is it so many things
you don't Iike are good for you?

5
00:02:08,724 --> 00:02:13,312
I couIdn't say offhand, Miss Barbara,
but you must eat some more of your spinach.

6
00:02:13,396 --> 00:02:15,690
Why do I have to?

7
00:02:15,773 --> 00:02:20,153
Your Iunch caIIs for so many vitamins,
and you must have them.

8
00:02:20,237 --> 00:02:22,322
AII right.

9
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:30,498
My goodness, that was an awfuI big vitamin.

10
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:36,296
- Have you finished, Miss Barbara?
- But definiteIy.

11
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,465
(sneezes)

12
00:02:58,697 --> 00:03:01,199
The third sneeze.

13
00:03:03,702 --> 00:03:06,580
Let me see your tongue.

14
00:03:06,664 --> 00:03:08,916
I'm afraid you'II have to go to bed.

15
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,379
I'm not sick. I feeI fine.

16
00:03:12,462 --> 00:03:16,550
CoIIins, she's perfectIy weII.
A sneeze is nothing to be aIarmed at.

17
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:20,930
Perhaps not, but I'm responsibIe for the chiId.
Come, my dear.

18
00:03:21,013 --> 00:03:23,933
Phone for Dr PaImer.

19
00:03:32,276 --> 00:03:35,822
The chiId sneezes and you'd think
the worId was coming to an end.

20
00:03:35,905 --> 00:03:40,035
Can't they Ieave her aIone?
She's a perfectIy normaI, heaIthy chiId.

21
00:03:40,118 --> 00:03:43,288
The way they carry on,
you'd think she was made of gIass.

22
00:03:43,372 --> 00:03:45,666
Something ought to be done with CoIIins.

23
00:03:45,749 --> 00:03:47,793
- How Mr Barry can...
- Sshh!

24
00:03:47,877 --> 00:03:50,171
..stand that femaIe is beyond me.

25
00:03:50,255 --> 00:03:54,593
WeII, you can't expect a widower
and a man as busy as Mr Barry is

26
00:03:54,676 --> 00:03:59,515
to notice everything
that's going on in the house.

27
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:02,518
Better do your teIephoning.

28
00:04:03,853 --> 00:04:09,318
No, itjust seems to be a sIight coId,
but Mr Barry aIways wants us to notify him.

29
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:14,407
Just got a message from Barry's home.
His chiId is iII.

30
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,285
Just got a message
from Barry's home. His chiId is iII.

31
00:04:17,368 --> 00:04:21,081
OK, I'II see that he gets the message.

32
00:04:21,164 --> 00:04:22,958
(intercom buzzes)

33
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:26,170
Mr Barry is wanted at home at once.
His child is quite ill.

34
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:28,339
ReaIIy?

35
00:04:32,177 --> 00:04:34,680
- Where's Mr Barry?
- At the househoId exhibit.

36
00:04:34,763 --> 00:04:38,851
- His daughter's seriousIy iII.
- I'II go over to the show and pick him up.

37
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:42,355
If he phones, teII him I'm on my way over.

38
00:05:07,884 --> 00:05:10,887
Thank you. Be ready
for the opening of the exhibit at 2.15.

39
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,473
(women) Yes, Mr Barry.

40
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,257
(clattering)

41
00:05:44,258 --> 00:05:46,677
- May I heIp?
- Thank you.

42
00:05:47,553 --> 00:05:51,433
Seems I can't do anything
without Barry making troubIe for me.

43
00:05:51,516 --> 00:05:54,686
I hate that man.
He causes me more sIeepIess nights...

44
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:59,984
SIeepIess nights? What does he do,
pIay a sIide trombone under your window?

45
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:04,113
Everything but that. I Iay awake
haIf the night thinking up new ideas.

46
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:09,036
Then I find Barry's not onIy beaten me
to them, he's topped me in a thousand ways.

47
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,622
I wish he'd drown in his own soap suds.

48
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:15,376
- I shouIdn't be boring you with my troubIes.
- That's aII right.

49
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,004
- Are you in this business?
- Yes.

50
00:06:18,088 --> 00:06:21,758
I'm with the Peck Company. Advertising.

51
00:06:21,842 --> 00:06:23,510
(laughs)

52
00:06:23,594 --> 00:06:29,142
I see. I'm sorry you disIike this feIIow Barry,
though. He's reaIIy not a bad sort.

53
00:06:29,225 --> 00:06:33,104
- Do you know him?
- SIightIy. My barber cuts his hair.

54
00:06:33,188 --> 00:06:38,235
- Maybe I couId bribe him to cut his throat.
- Mr Barry, do you think she'II be aII right?

55
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,821
I don't know. Let me see.

56
00:06:41,447 --> 00:06:47,537
- Yes, she'II do very niceIy.
- Thank you, Mr Barry. Just what I thought.

57
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:51,667
Of aII the rotten tricks! Letting me
taIk my head off without teIIing me.

58
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,589
Just another exampIe
of Barry cIeverness, I suppose.

59
00:07:01,386 --> 00:07:04,014
What was she burning about?

60
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:07,310
I keep her awake nights.

61
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:12,190
Mr Barry, you're wanted at home right away.
Barbara's very iII.

62
00:07:19,824 --> 00:07:22,785
? Oh me, oh my

63
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:25,622
? I'm so sad that I couId cry

64
00:07:25,705 --> 00:07:28,375
? With a very good reason why

65
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:31,170
? I've no one to be gay with

66
00:07:31,253 --> 00:07:33,756
? That's why I wear a frown

67
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,634
? No chiIdren I can pIay with

68
00:07:36,718 --> 00:07:39,387
? London Bridge is faIIing down

69
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:41,431
? My fair Iady

70
00:07:41,515 --> 00:07:45,478
? I wanna make mud pies

71
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:48,606
? In fact, I'd Iike to be a mess

72
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:50,817
? I wanna make mud pies

73
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,279
? I know that I'd find happiness

74
00:07:54,362 --> 00:07:59,618
? If I gotjam on my fingers,
chocoIate on my face

75
00:07:59,702 --> 00:08:03,373
? And moIasses aII over my dress

76
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:08,879
? You're the onIy friends I've ever had

77
00:08:10,547 --> 00:08:13,217
? But one minute you're good

78
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,262
? And the very next minute you're bad

79
00:08:16,346 --> 00:08:19,349
? At times I ought to hate you

80
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,311
? You make me feeI so bIue

81
00:08:22,394 --> 00:08:25,147
? But, honest, I can't hate you

82
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:28,317
? When you smiIe at me the way you do

83
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:30,820
? Oh, my goodness

84
00:08:30,904 --> 00:08:33,698
? There are times I want to Ieave you

85
00:08:33,782 --> 00:08:36,577
? You teII such awfuI Iies

86
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,330
? But I couId never Ieave you

87
00:08:39,413 --> 00:08:42,583
? When I Iook into those great big eyes

88
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:45,378
? Oh, my goodness

89
00:08:45,462 --> 00:08:48,256
? I Iove you, do you Iove me?

90
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,010
? Honey, if you don't, why don't ya?

91
00:08:51,093 --> 00:08:53,471
? Honey, if you won't, why won't ya?

92
00:08:53,554 --> 00:08:56,391
? Am I gonna have troubIe with you?

93
00:08:56,474 --> 00:08:59,227
? I reaIIy ought to scoId you

94
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:02,022
? You'II have me oId and grey

95
00:09:02,105 --> 00:09:04,817
? But when it's time to scoId you

96
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,987
? I hoId you in my arms and say

97
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,364
? Oh, my

98
00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:11,992

00:09:12,075 --> 00:09:13,785
? Oh, my goodness

100
00:09:40,232 --> 00:09:43,277
(German accent)
? Sometimes I ought to hate you

101
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,322
? You make me feeI so bIue

102
00:09:46,405 --> 00:09:49,242
? But, honest, I can't hate you

103
00:09:49,325 --> 00:09:52,537
? When you smiIe at me, my IoveIy Puppchen

104
00:09:52,621 --> 00:09:55,415
? Ach, mein gutness

121
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:05,286
How are you feeIing, honey?

122
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:08,331
I wouIdn't know how to feeI any better.

123
00:11:08,414 --> 00:11:10,750
WeII.

124
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:12,919
Ah.

125
00:11:13,837 --> 00:11:18,300
- WiII you read to me from this?
- AII right. Which one is it to be?

126
00:11:18,384 --> 00:11:21,971
It's the one where Betsy
runs away from the orphan asyIum

127
00:11:22,054 --> 00:11:26,017
and meets Tony, the organ grinder,
and his monkey.

128
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:30,522
''Betsy Ware was two years oId
when her mother died.''

129
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:34,277
''Because the famiIy was poor,
Betsy couIdn't stay at home.''

130
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,322
''So she was sent to an orphan asyIum.''

131
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:43,036
Which was an ugIy red-brick buiIding
far, far away from where Betsy used to Iive.

132
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,581
Yes. ''From where Betsy used to Iive.''

133
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:49,335
''A young man came dancing
round the corner in a green coat

134
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:51,504
and bumped right into her.''

135
00:11:51,588 --> 00:11:55,968
'''Excuse me,' said the young man.
'I'm aIways bumping into peopIe.'''

136
00:11:56,051 --> 00:11:59,680
''That's why they caII me Puddin' Head...''

137
00:12:03,852 --> 00:12:07,731
''So Mary couIdn't pIay that afternoon.
She had Iessons to do...''

138
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:12,278
No, no. Read what happened
after Betsy met Puddin' Head.

139
00:12:12,361 --> 00:12:16,324
Oh, excuse me.
Why, I must have skipped a page.

140
00:12:18,994 --> 00:12:21,204
- How is she?
- She's fine.

141
00:12:21,288 --> 00:12:27,545
The doctor was here and he said there isn't
the sIightest thing the matter with her.

142
00:12:34,886 --> 00:12:38,224
Now, you see, Mr Barry?
She's perfectIy aII right.

143
00:12:38,307 --> 00:12:41,185
CoIIins gets panicky
every time the chiId sneezes.

144
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:46,149
CoIIins is right. I want every precaution taken.

145
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:49,027
Of course, I know
it's none of my business, Mr Barry,

146
00:12:49,111 --> 00:12:52,698
but did you ever stop to consider
that the constant piIIing up

147
00:12:52,782 --> 00:12:57,579
of precautions and attentions
was bad for the chiId?

148
00:12:57,662 --> 00:13:02,626
Why, she's pampered
and watched over and babied to death.

149
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:06,839
- WouId you mind if I'd offer a suggestion?
- No, go ahead.

150
00:13:06,922 --> 00:13:13,847
If I were you, I'd send Barbara to schooI
where she'II be with other chiIdren.

151
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:17,267
There may be something in that.
Perhaps schooI's the thing.

152
00:13:17,351 --> 00:13:20,438
TeII CoIIins I wish to speak to her about it.

153
00:13:20,521 --> 00:13:23,858
I know what CoIIins wiII say.

154
00:13:23,942 --> 00:13:27,070
CoIIins aIways says no.

155
00:13:27,154 --> 00:13:31,033
- HeIIo, Daddy.
- HeIIo, sweet.

156
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:37,540
Daddy, why do I aIways have to pIay aIone?
Why can't I pIay with other chiIdren?

157
00:13:37,624 --> 00:13:41,169
- Honey, how wouId you Iike to go to schooI?
- Goody-goody!

158
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:44,423
- WeII, I guess that's settIed, then.
- Yes, Mr Barry?

159
00:13:44,506 --> 00:13:48,553
I'm sending Barbara to schooI in the
Adirondacks, where her mother used to go.

160
00:13:48,636 --> 00:13:51,306
But the chiId's much too young
for a summer camp.

161
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:55,143
Didn't I teII you CoIIins aIways said no?

162
00:13:55,227 --> 00:13:58,564
I've onIy been foIIowing your instructions.
I'm sorry if...

163
00:13:58,647 --> 00:14:00,900
She needs to be with other chiIdren.

164
00:14:00,983 --> 00:14:04,320
Get in touch with
the Forest Grove SchooI right away.

165
00:14:04,404 --> 00:14:06,990
Take care of aII the detaiIs.

166
00:14:07,073 --> 00:14:09,243
- Yes, sir.
- (man) Mr Barry.

167
00:14:09,618 --> 00:14:12,413
You wanted to Iisten to the changes
on your radio hour.

168
00:14:12,496 --> 00:14:15,583
- The programme's on now.
- Oh, yes.

169
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,752
(fanfare on radio)

170
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:30,683
? B-a-r-r-y

171
00:14:30,767 --> 00:14:36,940
? Why don't you buy a bar of Barry's?

172
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:40,528
? Every grocer carries Barry's

173
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:44,407
? You will find that Barry's little bubbles

174
00:14:44,491 --> 00:14:48,245
? Make you kinda laugh
at your washing troubles

175
00:14:48,328 --> 00:14:51,123
? Buy a bar of Barry's

176
00:14:51,206 --> 00:14:54,460
? It's the berries, that's Barry's

177
00:14:54,544 --> 00:14:56,546
? So run, don't waIk

178
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:01,635
? To the nearest exit
and find a bar of Barry's

179
00:15:05,431 --> 00:15:12,105
And now the Barry baritone will sing
that new hit tune, ''When l'm With You''.

180
00:15:14,441 --> 00:15:19,864
? Every street I waIk on becomes a Iovers Iane

181
00:15:19,947 --> 00:15:22,450
? When I'm with you

182
00:15:24,244 --> 00:15:29,500
? I can see the sun
though we're out in the rain

183
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:32,461
? When I'm with you

184
00:15:34,297 --> 00:15:38,051
? To lose you would be tragic

185
00:15:39,344 --> 00:15:43,557
? Here is my heart unfurled

186
00:15:44,141 --> 00:15:48,563
? You have that certain magic

187
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:52,651
? You're the Seven Wonders of the World

188
00:15:53,777 --> 00:15:59,033
? Snow is on the ground
but the Ieaves are on the trees

189
00:15:59,116 --> 00:16:01,869
? When I'm with you

190
00:16:03,371 --> 00:16:08,460
? Flowers sing a love song,
there's music in the breeze

191
00:16:08,543 --> 00:16:10,504
? When l'm with you

192
00:16:10,587 --> 00:16:13,424
? Ooh

193
00:16:13,507 --> 00:16:17,136
? Please let me make this confession

194
00:16:18,096 --> 00:16:23,268
? You are my magnifiicent obsession

195
00:16:23,352 --> 00:16:26,772
? The world is all in rhyme, lovely one

196
00:16:26,856 --> 00:16:30,985
? When l'm with you

197
00:16:32,696 --> 00:16:35,574
(applause on radio)

198
00:16:38,786 --> 00:16:46,586
You know, Daddy, this house wouIdn't be so
Ionesome if you'd stay home once in a whiIe.

199
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:51,342
If I stayed home aII the time,
there wouIdn't be any house.

200
00:16:51,425 --> 00:16:55,388
Do you know, Daddy, I can sing that song,
and I've got my own words.

201
00:16:55,471 --> 00:16:58,183
- Wanna hear them?
- Mm-hm.

202
00:17:00,685 --> 00:17:05,941
? An ordinary day becomes a hoIiday

203
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,528
? When I'm with you

204
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:15,452
? I have Iots of toys but I don't wanna pIay

205
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,871
? When I'm with you

206
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:24,295
? Oh, Daddy, how I miss you

207
00:17:25,338 --> 00:17:29,259
? You're busy aII your Iife

208
00:17:30,219 --> 00:17:33,848
? I Iove to hug and kiss you

209
00:17:34,724 --> 00:17:38,353
? Marry me and Iet me be your wife

210
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:44,526
? Every word I hear sounds Iike a IuIIaby

211
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,321
? When I'm with you

212
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,829
? Even funny spinach tastes Iike pumpkin pie

213
00:17:53,912 --> 00:17:56,206
? When I'm with you

214
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,500
? Ooh

215
00:17:58,584 --> 00:18:03,256
? In every dream I caress you

216
00:18:03,339 --> 00:18:08,679
? And every night
I pray the Lord wiII bIess you

217
00:18:08,762 --> 00:18:12,725
? The worId's a nursery rhyme, Daddy dear

218
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:17,480
? When I'm with you

219
00:18:31,204 --> 00:18:34,458
Are you going to stay in schooI with me?

220
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,503
No, my dear.
I'm going to take a IittIe vacation.

221
00:18:37,586 --> 00:18:40,882
- What's a vacation?
- It's a rest, dear.

222
00:18:40,965 --> 00:18:44,427
Getting away from peopIe you've been with
and seeing new faces.

223
00:18:44,511 --> 00:18:47,305
You reaIIy become
another person on a vacation.

224
00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:52,102
- What person are you gonna be?
- Just another person.

225
00:18:52,853 --> 00:18:57,317
- Is going to schooI a vacation?
- HardIy. Just the opposite.

226
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,445
You think CoIIins is strict,
but wait tiII you get to schooI.

227
00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:03,449
There'II be no running to Woodward
or to your daddy.

228
00:19:03,532 --> 00:19:05,826
You'II do just what you're toId.

229
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:09,288
I don't think I'm gonna Iike schooI.

230
00:19:09,372 --> 00:19:12,375
- May I take Snoopy with me?
- No, my dear.

231
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:15,838
- You're not aIIowed to have dogs in schooI.
- No?

232
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:19,341
- No, indeed.
- That settIes it.

233
00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:24,097
- AII right, darIing. We'd better get started.
- Come, my dear.

234
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,266
Goodbye, Snoopy.

235
00:19:32,106 --> 00:19:34,233
Are they expecting you this evening?

236
00:19:34,317 --> 00:19:36,945
I toId them we'd be out sometime this week.

237
00:19:37,028 --> 00:19:40,157
You'd better wire them
and have a car meet you.

238
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,870
- I'II do it from the station.
- You're going to be very happy at schooI.

239
00:19:44,954 --> 00:19:47,498
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

240
00:19:47,582 --> 00:19:53,839
Sure you're going to be happy.
I'II be up and spend every weekend with you.

241
00:19:59,595 --> 00:20:03,391
- Goodbye, sweetheart.
- Aren't you coming into the station with us?

242
00:20:03,474 --> 00:20:07,312
I'm sorry. I can't. I'm Iate
for a business appointment aIready.

243
00:20:07,396 --> 00:20:09,523
I'm aIways running away from you.

244
00:20:09,606 --> 00:20:13,527
I'II make up for it Saturday and Sunday.
I'II spend every minute with you.

245
00:20:13,611 --> 00:20:16,614
We'II have Iots of fun. Goodbye.

246
00:20:17,448 --> 00:20:21,161
- Take good care of her, CoIIins.
- Yes, sir.

247
00:20:21,244 --> 00:20:24,164
- What's this for?
- It weighs you for a penny.

248
00:20:24,248 --> 00:20:27,001
- I wanna be weighed.
- WeII, I haven't a penny.

249
00:20:27,084 --> 00:20:30,004
- I have a penny.
- AII right.

250
00:20:34,176 --> 00:20:36,261
No, here.

251
00:20:43,478 --> 00:20:48,859
On this side is your weight. 58 pounds.
And on this side is your fortune.

252
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:53,698
What does it say? What does it say?

253
00:20:53,781 --> 00:20:59,663
It says you're going away on a Iong trip.
You're going to meet a Iot of strange peopIe.

254
00:20:59,746 --> 00:21:02,040
What a smart machine.

255
00:21:02,124 --> 00:21:04,209
Come, my dear.

256
00:21:15,264 --> 00:21:18,392
Porter, I have to send a teIegram.

257
00:21:28,236 --> 00:21:31,156
My purse. It's gone.

258
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:35,620
I must have dropped it.
Keep an eye on her. I'II be back in a minute.

259
00:21:35,703 --> 00:21:37,789
Yes, ma'am.

260
00:21:56,518 --> 00:21:58,604
- (screeching tyres)
- Look out, Iady!

261
00:21:58,687 --> 00:22:00,940
(Collins screams)

262
00:22:04,986 --> 00:22:07,072
Come on! Give her air!

263
00:22:11,076 --> 00:22:14,664
- What's your name?
- Rufus Washington Jackson Lee.

264
00:22:15,832 --> 00:22:18,835
- AII by yourseIf?
- (chuckles)

265
00:22:18,918 --> 00:22:23,340
- My name is Betsy Ware.
- That's a mighty pretty name.

266
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,473
- Did you ever have a vacation?
- Oh, yes, missy. Lots and Iots of 'em.

267
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,435
- Are they fun?
- They are if you don't have too many.

268
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:37,231
I'II bet they're more fun than going to schooI.

269
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:42,445
I never had a vacation,
but I'm thinking about having one.

270
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:45,782
Look.

271
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:53,541
- Why don't you heIp your brother?
- Brother?

272
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:58,922
AII right, IittIe missy.
You just wait right here tiII I come back.

273
00:23:11,895 --> 00:23:16,817
There was a Iady and IittIe girI with these.
They went away and didn't come back.

274
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,986
AII right.

275
00:23:20,237 --> 00:23:24,451
- Has the woman been identified?
- No. No pocketbook, no Iaundry marks.

276
00:23:24,534 --> 00:23:30,040
You'd better caII up the bureau of missing
persons and have a description sent out.

277
00:23:30,124 --> 00:23:34,837
(hand organ playing ''Oh, My Goodness'')

278
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:39,092
It's Tony!

279
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,853
And his monkey!

280
00:24:04,704 --> 00:24:08,709
Gee, that's a sweII hat.
I wish I couId have one Iike it.

281
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:11,086
- Here, take it.
- Oh, thanks.

282
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:14,674
- And you may have these, too.
- Thanks a Iot.

283
00:24:33,111 --> 00:24:35,364
(speaks ltalian)

284
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,536
I know who you are. You're Tony.

285
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,331
That's right. Antonio is my middIe name.

286
00:24:43,414 --> 00:24:46,251
I'm on my vacation.
Do you wanna come aIong?

287
00:24:46,334 --> 00:24:49,922
You're very nice, IittIe bambina.
You go home to your mama.

288
00:24:50,005 --> 00:24:53,384
- I have no mama.
- That's too bad.

289
00:24:53,467 --> 00:24:55,887
Then go home to your papa.

290
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:58,807
- Say, what's your name?
- Betsy Ware.

291
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:03,228
I used to Iive in an orphanage,
but they were mean to me, awfuIIy mean.

292
00:25:03,312 --> 00:25:05,314
- And now I'm on a vacation.
- Huh?

293
00:25:05,481 --> 00:25:10,737
I'm on a vacation. To see new faces.
Your face doesn't Iook very new.

294
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,366
WeII, it's good enough for me. Goodbye.

295
00:25:32,344 --> 00:25:34,764
Here comes Papa! Here comes Papa!

296
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:36,933
(children shout)

297
00:25:42,272 --> 00:25:44,358
(they speak ltalian)

298
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:57,748
- Why you chase me for?
- I'm Betsy Ware.

299
00:25:57,831 --> 00:26:01,335
I used to Iive in an orphanage,
but they were awfuI mean to me.

300
00:26:01,419 --> 00:26:04,923
- And now I'm on a vacation.
- I know. You toId me that.

301
00:26:05,006 --> 00:26:08,135
- And you no Iike my face.
- Yes, I do.

302
00:26:09,136 --> 00:26:11,221
(speaks ltalian)

303
00:26:14,267 --> 00:26:16,769
(Tony) Ma! Ma!

304
00:26:28,282 --> 00:26:30,785
Who is she?

305
00:26:32,579 --> 00:26:35,290
Mama, maybe she's hungry.

306
00:26:36,792 --> 00:26:39,503
I go get her?

307
00:26:43,591 --> 00:26:46,720
Come, you stay in my house tonight.

308
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:05,950
Eat the spaghetti. They're good.

309
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,131
Look, Iook. Like this. Look.

310
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:31,312
- Here.
- Thank you.

311
00:27:31,395 --> 00:27:34,565
(speaks ltalian)

312
00:27:48,331 --> 00:27:50,500
- I sneezed.
- Salute.

313
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:53,253
Salute.

314
00:27:53,336 --> 00:27:56,507
- Don't I have to go to bed?
- What's the matter?

315
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:00,761
- You're sIeepy?
- You eat first.

316
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,930
I Iike it here.

317
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:14,110
So IittIe, and so sweet.

318
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,696
Maybe we keep her. Yes?

319
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:21,702
Are you crazy? What you want to do?
You want to go to jaiI for the kidnap?

320
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:26,374
Five chiIdren you have aIready.
Six with the monkey.

321
00:28:26,457 --> 00:28:30,670
AII right. Then I take her
to the poIiceman in the morning.

322
00:28:30,753 --> 00:28:33,256
(speaks ltalian)

323
00:28:39,138 --> 00:28:41,390
Come, bambina.

324
00:28:41,474 --> 00:28:43,560
(speaks ltalian)

325
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:52,445
(speaks ltalian)

326
00:29:07,587 --> 00:29:09,672
(whispers in ltalian)

327
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:20,351
- So fast she sIeeps.
- Maybe we'II keep her, huh?

328
00:29:42,376 --> 00:29:45,379
(? ''Oh, My Goodness'' on hand organ)

329
00:29:47,882 --> 00:29:49,968
Mama, come on! Get up!

330
00:29:54,514 --> 00:29:57,309
(music and laughter continues)

331
00:30:05,235 --> 00:30:07,904
This music comes in handy for rehearsing.

332
00:30:07,988 --> 00:30:12,785
- Rehearsing for what?
- Somebody may ask us to pIay a benefit.

333
00:30:12,868 --> 00:30:17,665
Don't forget - we got another
radio audition tomorrow.

334
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:22,296
You know, this radio racket is a Iot tougher
than vaudeviIIe used to be.

335
00:30:22,379 --> 00:30:26,050
- Remember when we got married?
- No, and don't remind me.

336
00:30:26,133 --> 00:30:29,512
And, by the way, I'm getting tired
of these radio auditions.

337
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:32,807
If we don't Iand a sponsor soon,
I'm going home to my mother.

338
00:30:32,891 --> 00:30:38,939
WeII, that's better than bringing
the oId battIe-axe here. I'm onIy kidding.

339
00:30:39,023 --> 00:30:45,030
Honey, I've been working on a step that's
gonna start BiII Robinson taIking to himseIf.

340
00:30:45,113 --> 00:30:47,199
Watch this.

341
00:30:50,995 --> 00:30:53,706
Like to see anybody tie that.

342
00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:55,875
(identical tapping)

343
00:31:09,223 --> 00:31:11,309
(identical tapping)

344
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:37,464
- I'm going to see who that hoofer is!
- WhiIe you're there, take a few Iessons.

345
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,387
(Mama) Bravo, bambina! Bravo!

346
00:31:45,598 --> 00:31:48,726
It's a kid. Jerry, Jerry!

347
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:54,942
Are you the one
who was answering my steps?

348
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,032
- Tony, who is she?
- She's an orphan.

349
00:32:01,115 --> 00:32:04,244
She run away. She foIIow me here.

350
00:32:06,621 --> 00:32:11,293
Jerry, she's a naturaI. Look at her.
Did you ever see a better bet?

351
00:32:11,377 --> 00:32:14,046
- Who is she?
- She's part of our act, kid.

352
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:17,258
DoIan, DoIan and DoIan.

353
00:32:20,303 --> 00:32:23,807
Say, what's your name?

354
00:32:23,891 --> 00:32:27,395
Betsy Ware. Are you Puddin' Head?

355
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:30,481
(children laugh)

356
00:32:30,565 --> 00:32:34,111
I'II say he's Puddin' Head. Come on.

357
00:32:38,866 --> 00:32:41,452
- What's this aII about?
- Don't you see?

358
00:32:41,536 --> 00:32:44,581
That kid's a noveIty.
Just what we need for the act.

359
00:32:44,664 --> 00:32:47,292
You crazy?
What do you know about the chiId?

360
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:50,170
AII there is to know.
She ran away from an orphan asyIum.

361
00:32:50,254 --> 00:32:54,717
Orphan asyIum! Did you notice her hands?
They don't manicure 'em in orphan asyIums.

362
00:32:54,801 --> 00:32:59,598
WeII, I don't know. Friend of mine
got his hair cut in Sing Sing.

363
00:33:04,436 --> 00:33:07,940
You're aIways making
mountains out of mothbaIIs.

364
00:33:08,024 --> 00:33:12,028
Supposing the kid's story does turn out
to be a phoney? So we beIieved it.

365
00:33:12,112 --> 00:33:14,740
We fed her, took care of her
and put her on the air.

366
00:33:14,823 --> 00:33:19,495
- They can't hang you for that, can they?
- They can try.

367
00:33:20,329 --> 00:33:22,415
Wait a minute.

368
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:35,138
I want the poIice department.
Bureau of missing persons.

369
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:38,600
Bureau of missing persons?

370
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,395
Is anybody missing?

371
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:45,316
Oh, thousands of peopIe?

372
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:48,653
That's very interesting.

373
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:52,949
Did anybody report a kid missing
by the name of Betsy Ware?

374
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:55,160
But, Jimmy...

375
00:33:55,244 --> 00:33:57,621
No record? Oh.

376
00:33:57,705 --> 00:34:00,917
No, no. I don't wanna make a report.
No, thanks.

377
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:05,797
But if I shouId ever Iose a kid by that name,
I'II Iet you know.

378
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,760
What? Oh, wise guy, hey?

379
00:34:09,843 --> 00:34:13,806
- You'd better turn her in anyway.
- I teII you, it's OK.

380
00:34:23,275 --> 00:34:28,281
Wait a minute. Listen, sweetheart. Remember,
you're Bonnie DoIan, the radio star.

381
00:34:28,364 --> 00:34:33,703
Don't use your reaI name around here.
Just forget that you're Betsy Ware.

382
00:34:33,787 --> 00:34:36,498
- Are we pIaying a game?
- That's it, a game.

383
00:34:36,582 --> 00:34:39,835
- WiII you pIay aIong with it?
- Mm-hm. I Iove games.

384
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:44,966
- AII right. Now, don't forget, Betsy.
- The name's Bonnie DoIan.

385
00:34:49,638 --> 00:34:51,515
We're DoIan, DoIan and DoIan.

386
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,687
We have an appointment with Dan Ward
of the Ward and WaIIace advertising agency.

387
00:34:55,770 --> 00:35:00,442
Oh, yes. For an audition.
Room B to your right, pIease.

388
00:35:06,574 --> 00:35:09,410
- HeIIo, Mr Ward. Mr Ward.
- Yes?

389
00:35:09,494 --> 00:35:14,249
This is my wife, Jerry.
And this is our kid, Bonnie DoIan.

390
00:35:14,332 --> 00:35:17,878
Have we got an act!
Have we got an act? I'm asking you.

391
00:35:17,962 --> 00:35:20,673
Don't ask me, show me!

392
00:35:22,133 --> 00:35:23,635
? Bong!

393
00:35:23,718 --> 00:35:28,515
? This is station L-O-V-E

394
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:29,850
? Bong!

395
00:35:29,933 --> 00:35:34,188
? I'm Cupid's assistant, pIease Iisten to me

396
00:35:34,522 --> 00:35:37,525
? My boss, Mr Cupid, toId me

397
00:35:37,609 --> 00:35:40,362
? To make hearts Ioop the Ioop

398
00:35:40,445 --> 00:35:45,993
? Never ever to sing about
the ''good ship IoIIipop''

399
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:49,163
? Or ''animaI crackers in my soup''

400
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:53,543
? So if the one you idoIise is near you

401
00:35:53,627 --> 00:35:57,047
? A song of Iove wiII heIp you find the way

402
00:35:57,965 --> 00:36:02,136
? Cupid says a wiIIing heart wiII hear you

403
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,723
? If you move a IittIe cIoser

404
00:36:04,806 --> 00:36:06,308
? Thank you

405
00:36:06,391 --> 00:36:08,435
? Press his IittIe hand

406
00:36:08,518 --> 00:36:10,104
? That's fine

407
00:36:10,187 --> 00:36:14,442
? Now Iook into his eyes and say...

408
00:36:16,903 --> 00:36:21,366
? You are an angeI without any wings

409
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:25,871
? A vision so IoveIy to see

410
00:36:25,955 --> 00:36:30,210
? Are you the reason my happy heart sings?

411
00:36:30,293 --> 00:36:32,796
? But definiteIy

412
00:36:34,756 --> 00:36:39,679
? WiII I for ever be faithfuI to you?

413
00:36:39,762 --> 00:36:43,808
? You're mine and you aIways must be

414
00:36:43,892 --> 00:36:48,146
? Do I adore you? You know that I do

415
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:50,232
? But definiteIy

416
00:36:50,315 --> 00:36:52,902
? So definiteIy

417
00:36:52,985 --> 00:36:56,322
? You are the moon, the stars, the sun

418
00:36:56,406 --> 00:36:58,575
? You're every beat of my heart

419
00:36:58,658 --> 00:37:01,787
? You're so supreme

420
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:07,585
? But if it aII turns out to be
onIy a beautifuI dream

421
00:37:07,668 --> 00:37:10,380
? Let's keep on dreaming

422
00:37:10,463 --> 00:37:15,636
? MiIIions or biIIions can't equaI your worth

423
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:19,724
? Your Iove is a bIessing to me

424
00:37:19,807 --> 00:37:24,062
? Are you an armfuI of heaven here on earth?

425
00:37:24,145 --> 00:37:25,772
? You are

426
00:37:25,855 --> 00:37:28,233
? But definiteIy

427
00:37:33,322 --> 00:37:37,911
? When you are crooning the bIue of the day

428
00:37:37,994 --> 00:37:41,081
? And whistIing the goId of the dawn

429
00:37:41,164 --> 00:37:42,875
? Bing-bing!

430
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:47,004
? Are you my favourite?
You know that you are

431
00:37:47,088 --> 00:37:50,049
? But definiteIy

432
00:37:50,133 --> 00:37:52,969
? Bo bo-bo-bo-bo

433
00:37:53,053 --> 00:37:54,930
? WiII I for ever?

434
00:37:55,013 --> 00:37:57,099
(whistles tune)

435
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:02,146
? You aIways must be, be-be-be-be

436
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:06,610
? Do I adore you? You know that I do

437
00:38:06,693 --> 00:38:09,279
? But definiteIy

438
00:38:09,363 --> 00:38:11,782
? So definiteIy

439
00:38:11,866 --> 00:38:15,870
? You are the moon, the stars, the sun

440
00:38:15,953 --> 00:38:18,540
? You're every beat of my heart

441
00:38:18,623 --> 00:38:21,835
? So supreme

442
00:38:21,919 --> 00:38:27,800
? But if it aII turns out to be
onIy a beautifuI dream

443
00:38:27,884 --> 00:38:31,554
? Let's keep on dreaming

444
00:38:31,638 --> 00:38:36,477
? MiIIions or biIIions can't equaI your worth

445
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,231
? Your Iove is a bIessing to me

446
00:38:41,566 --> 00:38:46,279
? Are you an armfuI of heaven here on earth?

447
00:38:46,363 --> 00:38:48,156
? You are

448
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,160
? B-b-but definiteIy

449
00:38:51,243 --> 00:38:53,579
? The name of this song ain't ''Dinah''

450
00:38:53,663 --> 00:38:55,999
? The name of this song ain't ''Dinah''

451
00:38:56,082 --> 00:38:58,043
? The name of this song ain't ''Dinah''

452
00:38:58,126 --> 00:39:00,754
? It's ''But DefiniteIy''

453
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,179
Not bad. I'II be right out.

454
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:21,277
I have a cIient who might be interested.
You wait here.

455
00:39:24,322 --> 00:39:27,075
- Didn't he Iike what we did?
- Sure.

456
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:30,996
I guess he's gone
to the next room to appIaud.

457
00:39:32,915 --> 00:39:38,755
Margaret? This is Dan. Listen, I've got the
greatest act that's ever been offered to radio.

458
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:43,427
It's no use, Dan.
Mr Peckjust won't go on the air.

459
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:49,183
I know he won't go for girIs, and I know he
won't go for crooners, but he'II go for this.

460
00:39:49,267 --> 00:39:51,853
But you said we were good.

461
00:39:51,936 --> 00:39:56,066
Never pay any attention to what he says.

462
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:58,319
Maybe we were too good.

463
00:40:04,409 --> 00:40:06,495
- Oh, uh...
- Yes?

464
00:40:06,578 --> 00:40:09,498
- This cIient of mine...
- Yeah?

465
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:12,626
- ..that I was teIIing you about...
- Yes?

466
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,796
..wiII see you this afternoon.

467
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:18,925
- We're good!
- We're good! We're good! We're good!

468
00:40:19,009 --> 00:40:21,762
- Can you be there at three?
- Can we be there at three?

469
00:40:21,845 --> 00:40:26,434
- Can we be there at three?
- We'II be there at five minutes to three.

470
00:40:26,976 --> 00:40:30,313
Good afternoon. Peck's Soap Company.

471
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:35,319
Good afternoon. Peck's Soap Company.

472
00:40:35,402 --> 00:40:41,117
I don't care how good they are!
I teII you, I don't want a radio show!

473
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,953
But, Mr Peck,
if you'd onIy give them an audition...

474
00:40:44,037 --> 00:40:47,499
It's a most unusuaI act, Mr Peck.
They'II be up here in a few moments.

475
00:40:47,582 --> 00:40:50,085
- Shut up!
- (phone rings)

476
00:40:53,714 --> 00:40:55,425
Oh.

477
00:40:55,508 --> 00:41:00,514
Mr Barry of the Barry Soap Company is here.
Says he has an appointment.

478
00:41:00,597 --> 00:41:05,269
Do you know what that young upstart wants?
TeIephoned me, said he wanted to see me.

479
00:41:05,352 --> 00:41:07,730
- I have no idea.
- WeII, I have.

480
00:41:07,814 --> 00:41:10,608
He wants me to buy him out.

481
00:41:10,692 --> 00:41:14,112
Buy him out?
Why, Mr Peck, the Barry saIes are...

482
00:41:14,196 --> 00:41:17,282
I know he's been seIIing soap!

483
00:41:17,366 --> 00:41:22,664
But he's been spending 11 cents on baIIyhoo
for every 10-cent cake he's soId.

484
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:24,833
- But the figures show...
- Figures!

485
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:30,381
It takes no genius to offer five-doIIar biIIs
for four eighty and do a voIume of business.

486
00:41:30,464 --> 00:41:36,429
But the day of reckoning is aIways around
the corner, and it's caught up with Barry.

487
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,723
ShaII I show him in?

488
00:41:38,807 --> 00:41:41,018
Yes, show him in.

489
00:41:41,101 --> 00:41:43,187
You stay, Gooch.

490
00:41:46,691 --> 00:41:49,944
- WeII, weII. If it isn't Peck's bad girI.
- HeIIo, Mr Barry.

491
00:41:50,028 --> 00:41:55,158
- Mr Peck wants you to go right in.
- That's mighty white of the oId man.

492
00:41:55,242 --> 00:42:00,289
Listen, how wouId you Iike
to have Iunch with your boss?

493
00:42:00,373 --> 00:42:03,668
- With my boss?
- Sure. I'm gonna buy up the whoIe shebang.

494
00:42:03,751 --> 00:42:08,715
It's on its Iast Iegs and Peck'II probabIy
be gIad to seII it for a song.

495
00:42:08,799 --> 00:42:12,052
- What's funny about that?
- (telephonist) Yes, sir. I'II teII him.

496
00:42:12,136 --> 00:42:15,223
Mr Peck wants to know what's deIaying you.

497
00:42:15,306 --> 00:42:19,102
The oId boy can't wait. See you Iater.

498
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,361
WeII...

499
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:29,864
Mr Peck...

500
00:42:29,948 --> 00:42:34,327
Yes, Mr Barry?
Just what can I do for you today?

501
00:42:34,411 --> 00:42:40,126
WeII, Peck, I understand that this pIace
is going to... going to pot.

502
00:42:41,043 --> 00:42:44,547
Now, I might consider
taking it off your hands.

503
00:42:44,631 --> 00:42:48,844
But... do I understand you to say...?

504
00:42:48,927 --> 00:42:51,847
You understand me to say
that I'II buy you out. How much?

505
00:42:51,931 --> 00:42:57,228
Have you the coIossaI insoIence
to suggest that I seII my business to you?

506
00:42:57,312 --> 00:43:01,608
Why not? You've been Iosing money
for two years. You're practicaIIy broke.

507
00:43:01,692 --> 00:43:05,613
Get out! Get out, before I kick you out!
Now get out.

508
00:43:05,696 --> 00:43:10,159
I gather that he doesn't want to seII.
Is that your impression too?

509
00:43:10,243 --> 00:43:13,288
- DefiniteIy.
- Very weII.

510
00:43:13,371 --> 00:43:15,457
Good day.

511
00:43:24,259 --> 00:43:26,344
HeIIo, boss.

512
00:43:29,264 --> 00:43:32,268
Boss or no boss,
how about the date for Iuncheon?

513
00:43:32,351 --> 00:43:34,479
WeII, I couIdn't possibIy.

514
00:43:34,562 --> 00:43:38,900
Come on, be a sport.
You're even with me, aren't you?

515
00:43:38,984 --> 00:43:41,695
I'm ahead of you.

516
00:43:46,784 --> 00:43:49,370
When wiII it be?

517
00:43:49,454 --> 00:43:53,416
- Oh, Friday at one?
- Fine. At the Savoy?

518
00:43:58,506 --> 00:44:02,260
Say, Margaret,
isn't he one of our competitors?

519
00:44:02,343 --> 00:44:05,722
As far as I'm concerned,
he has no competition.

520
00:44:05,805 --> 00:44:08,517
(whistles ''When l'm With You'')

521
00:44:19,029 --> 00:44:21,114
(man) 16.

522
00:44:28,164 --> 00:44:30,250
Peck's Soap Company.

523
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:34,087
- We're DoIan, DoIan and DoIan.
- The radio stars.

524
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:37,716
Oh, yes. DoIan, DoIan and DoIan.
And which one are you?

525
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:42,847
I'm the one in the middIe.

526
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:48,228
Miss AIIen's busy at the moment.
WiII you wait in her office?

527
00:44:48,312 --> 00:44:50,397
Thank you.

528
00:45:03,454 --> 00:45:06,791
DarIing, don't do that.
Be a good girI and sit down over there.

529
00:45:06,874 --> 00:45:11,629
- I wanna taIk to Puddin' Head a minute.
- Do me a favour and stop worrying.

530
00:45:11,713 --> 00:45:14,633
- You're beginning to Iook terribIe.
- Why wouIdn't I?

531
00:45:14,716 --> 00:45:20,014
I dozed off this morning at 3.30
and sIept Iike a Iog tiII four.

532
00:45:22,684 --> 00:45:28,440
(Jimmy) The way you're acting,
you'd think we were kidnappers.

533
00:45:28,523 --> 00:45:35,198
(Jerry) That's what I'm afraid the judge
wiII think. We may get off with Iife.

534
00:45:47,837 --> 00:45:49,923
HeIIo.

535
00:45:53,426 --> 00:45:58,599
- How'd you get in here? Who are you?
- I'm Bonnie DoIan, the big radio star.

536
00:45:58,682 --> 00:46:03,479
You know, DoIan, DoIan and DoIan.
And are we good!

537
00:46:03,563 --> 00:46:05,023
Ah.

538
00:46:05,106 --> 00:46:08,652
So they sent you in here
to soften me up, did they?

539
00:46:08,735 --> 00:46:13,741
Young Iady, you're wasting your time.
Now get outta here.

540
00:46:20,582 --> 00:46:25,296
- Why have you got so many doors?
- To keep out nuisances one door won't stop.

541
00:46:25,379 --> 00:46:28,508
- But they aII open.
- Ah.

542
00:46:32,637 --> 00:46:34,890
- What's this?
- Nothing to do with you.

543
00:46:34,973 --> 00:46:37,685
Now, get aIong with you.

544
00:46:39,437 --> 00:46:45,652
Why do you want me to go? You're aII aIone,
and I'm not doing anything, either.

545
00:46:46,361 --> 00:46:50,324
- TeII me a story.
- I don't know any stories.

546
00:46:51,033 --> 00:46:54,161
You know, you remind me
of oId Mr SpindIeshanks.

547
00:46:54,245 --> 00:46:56,956
- Who?
- Mr SpindIeshanks.

548
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:01,003
He's the grouch in the Betsy Ware stories
who heIps Betsy when she's hungry...

549
00:47:01,086 --> 00:47:04,048
Hungry? You're not hungry, are you?

550
00:47:04,131 --> 00:47:08,219
No. I just had Iunch,
and I did something bad, too.

551
00:47:08,302 --> 00:47:11,973
- What'd you do?
- WeII, we had spinach.

552
00:47:12,057 --> 00:47:16,854
And whiIe Jimmy wasn't Iooking,
I put mine on his pIate.

553
00:47:17,938 --> 00:47:20,399
No, no. That is wrong.

554
00:47:20,483 --> 00:47:23,653
You shouId have eaten your spinach.
It's good for you.

555
00:47:23,736 --> 00:47:26,239
So I've heard.

556
00:47:27,532 --> 00:47:31,245
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to get aIong.

557
00:47:31,328 --> 00:47:34,415
- Why?
- You said for me to.

558
00:47:34,499 --> 00:47:39,546
I didn't say anything of the kind.
AII I said was that spinach was good for you.

559
00:47:39,629 --> 00:47:42,132
Come back here.

560
00:47:44,552 --> 00:47:47,054
Sit down over there.

561
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,706
(Peck sighs)

562
00:48:12,625 --> 00:48:14,710
(Barbara sighs)

563
00:48:21,259 --> 00:48:23,762
Come over here.

564
00:48:27,558 --> 00:48:30,270
You Iike these pictures?

565
00:48:34,107 --> 00:48:36,402
- Do you know something?
- What?

566
00:48:36,485 --> 00:48:39,613
I didn't think I was gonna Iike you at first.

567
00:48:39,697 --> 00:48:42,200
But I Iike you now.

568
00:48:43,076 --> 00:48:45,245
- Do you?
- Yes.

569
00:48:45,328 --> 00:48:49,792
- Your eyebrows are so nice and ragged.
- (stutters)

570
00:48:51,585 --> 00:48:53,671
AII right.

571
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:57,300
So you're a singer, are you?

572
00:48:57,383 --> 00:48:59,010
Mm-hm.

573
00:48:59,094 --> 00:49:03,348
- Sing a song for me.
- AII right.

574
00:49:03,432 --> 00:49:06,227
? Buy a bar of Barry's

575
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:09,856
- ? Every grocer carries Barry's...
- Stop it! Stop it, I say!

576
00:49:09,939 --> 00:49:12,692
- What's the matter?
- Where'd you Iearn that trash?

577
00:49:12,776 --> 00:49:15,821
On the radio. I heard it on the radio.

578
00:49:15,904 --> 00:49:17,323
Ah.

579
00:49:17,406 --> 00:49:21,160
Radio. There oughta be a Iaw against it.

580
00:49:21,244 --> 00:49:23,580
Now, come on.

581
00:49:23,663 --> 00:49:25,749
Look at the pictures.

582
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,297
- Do you know how to pIay piggyback?
- (stutters)

583
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:35,385
- No, I don't think I do.
- Oh, it's easy.

584
00:49:39,681 --> 00:49:42,559
Stand up. Stand up.

585
00:49:42,643 --> 00:49:45,229
Turn round.

586
00:49:45,312 --> 00:49:50,610
Now I put my arms around your neck Iike this.
Now go Iike this.

587
00:49:50,693 --> 00:49:55,365
? Ride a cock horse to Banbury Cross
to see a fine Iady upon a white horse

588
00:49:55,449 --> 00:50:00,705
? Rings on her fingers and beIIs on her toes,
she shaII have music wherever she goes

589
00:50:00,788 --> 00:50:05,669
Now you run around and around
whiIe you sing it. Take my Iegs.

590
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:10,716
? Ride a cock horse to Banbury Cross
to see a fine Iady upon a white horse

591
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:14,595
? Rings on her fingers and beIIs on her toes,
she shaII have music...

592
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:17,640
Get out! Can't you see I'm in conference?

593
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:23,647
? Ride a cock horse to Banbury Cross

594
00:50:23,731 --> 00:50:25,649
Whoa!

595
00:50:25,733 --> 00:50:31,656
- Do you aIways teII peopIe to get out?
- When I'm engaged in important business.

596
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:36,829
? Ride a cock horse to Banbury Cross
to see a fine Iady on a white horse

597
00:50:36,912 --> 00:50:40,041
Sorry, foIks, to keep you waiting.
I'm Miss AIIen.

598
00:50:40,124 --> 00:50:43,169
Where's the chiId?
You haven't forgotten her?

599
00:50:43,253 --> 00:50:47,215
- She was just here.
- Mr Peck wants to see you at once.

600
00:50:47,299 --> 00:50:52,763
You'd better go right in.
I'II Iook for the chiId. Right in there.

601
00:50:52,847 --> 00:50:59,271
? Rings on her fingers and beIIs on her toes,
she shaII have music wherever she goes

602
00:50:59,354 --> 00:51:01,231
(knocking)

603
00:51:01,315 --> 00:51:03,400
Come in.

604
00:51:05,736 --> 00:51:06,779
Ah.

605
00:51:06,862 --> 00:51:10,450
So you thought you'd trick me
into going on the air, did you?

606
00:51:10,533 --> 00:51:11,618
Oh, no.

607
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:15,414
You deIiberateIy sent this chiId
to infIuence me.

608
00:51:15,497 --> 00:51:19,251
WeII, I'II Iet you know, it didn't work.

609
00:51:23,631 --> 00:51:28,470
As a matter of fact, I made up my mind
a Iong time ago to go on the air.

610
00:51:28,554 --> 00:51:32,349
But she had nothing to do with it,
nothing whatever.

611
00:51:32,433 --> 00:51:37,105
She didn't infIuence me the sIightest.
Now, understand that.

612
00:51:37,188 --> 00:51:41,193
- Yes, of course.
- Arrange for time on the air at once.

613
00:51:41,276 --> 00:51:45,823
I want these foIks to start
on a series of 15-minute programmes

614
00:51:45,906 --> 00:51:48,785
five nights a week, starting tomorrow night.

615
00:51:48,868 --> 00:51:53,206
Tomorrow night?
But, Mr Peck, I couIdn't possibIy do that...

616
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:56,001
Then make it possibIe!

617
00:51:59,296 --> 00:52:02,216
Didn't I teII you aII we needed was a break?

618
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:05,971
- 13 weeks on the dotted Iine.
- It's wonderfuI, Jimmy.

619
00:52:06,054 --> 00:52:09,349
- I hope we cIick.
- Why, we'II knock 'em dead.

620
00:52:09,433 --> 00:52:14,272
- Do we have to kiII peopIe?
- No, we won't kiII them. We'II just sIay them.

621
00:52:14,355 --> 00:52:16,441
Oh.

622
00:52:20,988 --> 00:52:22,948
They'II be on in a few minutes.

623
00:52:23,031 --> 00:52:28,079
And if you wanna see a radio show
that'II make yours Iook sick...

624
00:52:28,162 --> 00:52:30,999
They can't be that good.

625
00:52:31,082 --> 00:52:35,712
AII right, I'II Iisten.
I'II teII you about it at Iunch tomorrow.

626
00:52:35,796 --> 00:52:37,256
Goodbye.

627
00:52:45,348 --> 00:52:47,434
(applause)

628
00:52:48,644 --> 00:52:52,732
Ginsberg's Troubadours
are on in just a moment, sir.

629
00:52:52,815 --> 00:52:56,402
Now, my dear, remember,
there are a Iot of peopIe out there,

630
00:52:56,486 --> 00:53:00,031
and you mustn't be nervous,
you mustn't be afraid.

631
00:53:00,115 --> 00:53:03,369
- Afraid of what?
- That's just it, my dear.

632
00:53:03,452 --> 00:53:08,791
There's nothing to be afraid of, reaIIy,
but this is aII going to be new to you.

633
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:13,547
- Do you want me to be afraid?
- Heavens, no, darIing.

634
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:15,841
That's why I'm teIIing you.

635
00:53:15,924 --> 00:53:20,263
If I do get afraid,
it'II be on account of you taIking so much.

636
00:53:20,346 --> 00:53:22,098
(stutters)

637
00:53:22,181 --> 00:53:28,230
You're right, my dear.
You're perfectIy... Let's have Iess chatter!

638
00:53:29,982 --> 00:53:32,693
DoIan, DoIan and DoIan, ready!

639
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:47,627
Tonight we are inaugurating the Peck Soap
Hour over the Federal Broadcasting System.

640
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:51,214
It is with great pIeasure
that I present DoIan, DoIan and DoIan,

641
00:53:51,297 --> 00:53:54,176

642
00:53:54,259 --> 00:53:56,345

643
00:54:13,364 --> 00:54:15,450
(phone rings)

644
00:54:22,916 --> 00:54:24,501
HeIIo?

645
00:54:24,585 --> 00:54:26,712
Yes?

646
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:28,965
What?

647
00:54:29,048 --> 00:54:31,134
I'm sorry. I can't hear you.

648

Hey! Where are you going with that kid?

Yeah? If anybody's going to buy her candy,

(turns down volume)

797
01:04:18,461 --> 01:04:20,630
(buzzer)

798
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:33,145
I'm sorry. I got tangIed

AIways another factory.

You'II drown in your own soap suds yet.

801
01:04:40,945 --> 01:04:43,406
I'm afraid I can't afford to drown now.

805
01:04:55,586 --> 01:04:59,966
But Bonnie goes on again
after this orchestra finishes.

806
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:03,804

811
01:05:24,953 --> 01:05:29,374
I mean her voice,
it's... it's just Iike Barbara's.

812
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:33,838
If I didn't know my chiId

813
01:05:33,921 --> 01:05:36,549
AII chiIdren's voices sound about aIike.

814
01:05:36,633 --> 01:05:39,845
It's just that sIight difference
that makes Bonnie stand out.

815
01:05:39,928 --> 01:05:43,891
A proud father probabIy
wouIdn't even notice that difference.

816
01:05:45,226 --> 01:05:48,354
? Marry me and let me be your wife

817
01:05:48,438 --> 01:05:51,399
- That's Barbara. It is.
- Are you Iosing your mind?

818
01:05:51,483 --> 01:05:56,071
- That's Bonnie DoIan.
- But, I teII you, it's my daughter.

819
01:05:56,155 --> 01:05:59,575
- Where's your phone?
- Right there.

820
01:05:59,659 --> 01:06:04,372
? Even funny spinach tastes Iike pumpkin pie

821
01:06:04,456 --> 01:06:06,666
? When I'm with you

822
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:08,669
? Ooh

823
01:06:08,752 --> 01:06:11,547
You're just making
a compIete idiot of yourseIf...

824
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:15,635
- Be quiet. CentraI 88632.
- I wiII not be quiet.

825
01:06:15,718 --> 01:06:18,596
You must be crazy.
I know the chiId and her parents.

826
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:21,767
I teII you, I'm her parent.

827
01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:24,228
HeIIo. This is Richard Barry taIking.

828
01:06:24,311 --> 01:06:27,982
You have my daughter there,
the IittIe girI singing on the Peck Hour.

829
01:06:28,065 --> 01:06:31,444
- HoId her. I'II be right over.
- Your daughter.

830
01:06:31,528 --> 01:06:37,826
HeIIo, operator? Give me the Forest Grove
SchooI. At FerncIiff. Yes, quick.

831
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:41,664
- This is CoIumbus 8514.
- You're just stirring up a mess of troubIe.

832
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:44,083
- Why are you so stubborn?
- You're stubborn.

833
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:47,003
Why do I have to marry a girI Iike this?

834
01:06:47,087 --> 01:06:50,549
Who said you're going to?
I wouIdn't marry you...

835
01:06:50,633 --> 01:06:53,219
You'II marry me if I want you to.

836
01:06:53,302 --> 01:06:56,389
- HeIIo?
- This is Richard Barry taIking.

837
01:06:56,472 --> 01:07:01,186
- Is my daughter Barbara there?
- No, Mr Barry. We're waiting for her.

838
01:07:02,104 --> 01:07:06,025
- Haven't you received a wire from her nurse?
- No, Mr Barry. ShaII we...

839
01:07:08,444 --> 01:07:10,655
- She never got to the schooI.
- ReaIIy?

840
01:07:10,738 --> 01:07:13,200
Come on.

841
01:07:13,283 --> 01:07:15,661
And were you good!

842
01:07:15,744 --> 01:07:18,956
We certainIy sIayed them, didn't we?

843
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:24,003
Come on, darIing.

844
01:07:24,087 --> 01:07:29,843
Great IittIe trooper, that kid.
Just Iike her father. I taught her aII she knows.

845
01:07:29,927 --> 01:07:33,472
When she was six months oId,
the name of the act was DoIan and DoIan.

846
01:07:33,973 --> 01:07:36,726
- Then she used to...
- Mr Peck, Mr Barry just phoned.

847
01:07:36,809 --> 01:07:40,564
Said Bonnie is his daughter
and wants us to hoId her here.

848
01:07:40,647 --> 01:07:45,945
Barry, huh? Trying to put something
over on me again. The nerve!

849
01:07:46,028 --> 01:07:49,490
- What eIse did he say?
- That's aII, except he was on his way over.

850
01:07:49,574 --> 01:07:54,705
Good! I'II teII that cheap upstart
just where he gets off.

851
01:07:54,788 --> 01:07:58,250
Trying to steaI my taIent, is he? I'II sue him.

852
01:07:58,334 --> 01:08:02,547
Here, you get your wife and chiId
and get them out of here.

853
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:05,133
I know how to handIe Barry!

854
01:08:05,216 --> 01:08:09,722
- Let's get outta here. Don't ask questions.
- Where are we going?

855
01:08:16,729 --> 01:08:18,481
Taxi!

856
01:08:18,565 --> 01:08:20,275
Taxi!

857
01:08:20,776 --> 01:08:23,278
Taxi!

858
01:08:23,362 --> 01:08:26,449
Listen, honey, teII us the truth.
Do you know Mr Barry?

859
01:08:26,532 --> 01:08:30,119
- You won't be angry if I teII you?
- No, sweetheart.

860
01:08:30,203 --> 01:08:32,914
Mr Barry's my daddy.

861
01:08:34,124 --> 01:08:37,628
I toId you she didn'tjump out of a hat,
that they'd catch up with us.

862
01:08:37,711 --> 01:08:40,047
- What'II we do now?
- There's onIy one thing.

863
01:08:40,131 --> 01:08:43,968
Take her home, teIephone Barry
where she is and then duck. FIag a taxi.

864
01:08:44,052 --> 01:08:46,680
- Taxi!
- I shouId have known better.

865
01:08:46,763 --> 01:08:50,601
There's nothing to be afraid of.
AII we've got to do is...

866
01:08:50,684 --> 01:08:51,811
Oh.

867
01:08:53,521 --> 01:08:58,777
- An awfuIIy nice kid you have there.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

868
01:09:08,371 --> 01:09:11,291
Taxi. Taxi!

869
01:09:23,012 --> 01:09:27,935
(Jerry) DarIing, we've got to go. Something
has come up and we've got to go right away.

870
01:09:28,018 --> 01:09:31,772
- (Barbara) Can't I go with you?
- (Jimmy) No, you stay here.

871
01:09:31,856 --> 01:09:35,068
But I don't wanna stay here aII aIone.

872
01:09:37,946 --> 01:09:41,575
Honey, do us a big favour. Stay right here.

873
01:09:43,869 --> 01:09:46,288
Listen, sweet, you stay here,

874
01:09:46,372 --> 01:09:50,084
we'II caII your daddy
and he'II come for you in a few minutes.

875
01:09:50,877 --> 01:09:52,838
Oh.

876
01:09:55,799 --> 01:09:58,928
Here, sweet. PIay with your toys.

877
01:09:59,804 --> 01:10:01,889
(music box tinkles)

878
01:10:03,099 --> 01:10:05,185
Goodbye, darIing.

879
01:10:06,937 --> 01:10:09,314
Goodbye.

880
01:10:11,233 --> 01:10:13,319
Goodbye, Puddin' Head.

881
01:10:13,402 --> 01:10:15,488
Come on.

882
01:10:40,683 --> 01:10:45,146
A fine cock-and-buII story. If she's
your daughter, what's she doing here?

883
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:51,278
- I have no time to expIain now. Where is she?
- She's gone, and don't teII him where she is.

884
01:10:51,362 --> 01:10:55,533
- Can't you see I'm teIIing you the truth?
- (phone rings)

885
01:10:55,616 --> 01:10:57,285
Yes? Yes.

886
01:10:57,368 --> 01:10:59,454
It's for you, Richard.

887
01:11:00,622 --> 01:11:02,166
Yes?

888
01:11:02,249 --> 01:11:06,212
What's the number of the house?
Yes, what fIoor?

889
01:11:06,295 --> 01:11:09,132
The parIour fIoor, the first door to your Ieft.

890
01:11:10,425 --> 01:11:13,011
I know where she is. She's aII aIone!

891
01:11:13,094 --> 01:11:15,013
Is she reaIIy your daughter?

892
01:11:15,097 --> 01:11:19,143
Isn't that what I've been teIIing you,
you crazy oId buzzard?

893
01:11:20,978 --> 01:11:23,857
We're a coupIe of heeIs,
running out on the kid.

894
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:26,234
- I know, but...
- And a coupIe of saps.

895
01:11:26,318 --> 01:11:29,488
- They're bound to get us.
- I guess you're right.

896
01:11:29,571 --> 01:11:32,950
Everybody knows DoIan and DoIan.
They know we had the kid, too.

897
01:11:33,034 --> 01:11:36,371
Of course, and if we run away, it'II Iook worse.

898
01:11:36,454 --> 01:11:40,417
Come on. Let's go back and face it.

899
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:43,963
Come on, now. Be a nice IittIe girI.

900
01:11:44,046 --> 01:11:48,634
I'II buy you a pretty present
if you teII me who your father is.

901
01:11:48,718 --> 01:11:51,262
I won't teII you. I don't Iike you.

902
01:11:51,346 --> 01:11:54,891
- You'd better teII.
- I won't! I won't! You Iet me go!

903
01:11:54,975 --> 01:11:59,563
- No, you don't. You're coming with me.
- I am not! I am not!

904
01:11:59,647 --> 01:12:02,692
I'm waiting! I'm waiting! I promised Jerry!

905
01:12:02,775 --> 01:12:06,112
Hey! Where are you going with that kid?

906
01:12:10,618 --> 01:12:13,746
Jimmy, Iead with your Ieft!

907
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:43,571
Hit him hard, Puddin' Head!

908
01:12:48,619 --> 01:12:51,413
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

909
01:12:51,497 --> 01:12:55,752
- Daddy! Daddy! Oh, Daddy!
- (Jerry) Are you aII right, Jimmy?

910
01:12:55,835 --> 01:12:59,589
- Who brought you here?
- They did.

911
01:12:59,673 --> 01:13:01,967
- Where's CoIIins?
- I don't know.

912
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:05,721
She Iost her purse and went away.
So I thought I'd go on a vacation.

913
01:13:05,805 --> 01:13:10,185
I found Tony, and then
Mr and Mrs Puddin' Head found me.

914
01:13:11,227 --> 01:13:15,482
What are they doing, Daddy?
They're hurting them, and they're my friends.

915
01:13:15,566 --> 01:13:17,735
They're my best friends.

916
01:13:17,818 --> 01:13:20,404
They saved me from that bad man.

917
01:13:20,488 --> 01:13:25,035
She toId us she ran away from
an orphan asyIum, and we beIieved her.

918
01:13:25,118 --> 01:13:28,163
- Didn't you teII us that, Bonnie?
- Yes, I did.

919
01:13:28,247 --> 01:13:32,752
But I wasn't teIIing a Iie. I was just pIaying
a game, and they pIayed with me.

920
01:13:32,835 --> 01:13:34,170
I see.

921
01:13:34,253 --> 01:13:37,632
I've never had so much fun in my whoIe Iife.

922
01:13:37,716 --> 01:13:40,761
But I'm gIad to be back with you, Daddy.

923
01:13:40,844 --> 01:13:44,473
Barbara. Officers,
I'm afraid I've put you to a Iot of bother.

924
01:13:44,557 --> 01:13:48,311
- You needn't hoId those peopIe any Ionger.
- Wait. I've got a contract.

925
01:13:48,394 --> 01:13:53,942
- You know what that contract's worth?
- You've been trying to buy each other out.

926
01:13:54,026 --> 01:13:58,989
Why don't you merge the two companies?
You can wash the neck of the whoIe nation.

927
01:13:59,073 --> 01:14:03,745
- That's a thought.
- Merge with him? Never!

928
01:14:03,828 --> 01:14:07,082
I don't know what that means,
but why don't you do it?

929
01:14:13,214 --> 01:14:16,384
? When I hear the bIast of a bugIe

930
01:14:18,970 --> 01:14:21,848
? I know I soon wiII see

931
01:14:21,932 --> 01:14:23,934
? A miIitary man

932
01:14:24,018 --> 01:14:26,520
? When I hear the sound of a drum

933
01:14:26,604 --> 01:14:29,148
? Rum tummy tum-tum

934
01:14:29,232 --> 01:14:31,985
? I know I soon wiII see

935
01:14:32,068 --> 01:14:34,196
? A miIitary man

936
01:14:34,279 --> 01:14:36,740
? I Iove a miIitary man

937
01:14:36,824 --> 01:14:39,285
? I Iove a miIitary man

938
01:14:39,368 --> 01:14:42,372
? I Iove a miIitary... nurse

939
01:14:45,125 --> 01:14:48,962
(woman) ? My, but it's so grand
to see a miIitary man

940
01:14:49,797 --> 01:14:53,634
? Every boy shouId want to be a miIitary man

941
01:14:54,552 --> 01:14:59,307
? What a treat to marching feet
the roII of a drum

942
01:14:59,391 --> 01:15:02,895
? What a treat to marching feet the rum-tum

943
01:15:02,978 --> 01:15:04,438
(man) ? The rummy tum-tum-tum

944
01:15:04,522 --> 01:15:08,693
(woman) ? In a crowd he Iooks so proud,
the miIitary man

945
01:15:08,901 --> 01:15:13,281
? In his uniform so spic and span

946
01:15:13,365 --> 01:15:15,909
? Hearts are fiIIed with joy
and they're thriIIed with joy

947
01:15:15,993 --> 01:15:18,162
? Whenever a march is pIayed

948
01:15:18,245 --> 01:15:23,459
? For everybody Ioves to see a soIdier parade
