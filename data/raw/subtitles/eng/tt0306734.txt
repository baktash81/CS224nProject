1
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,591
What is the purpose
of your visit to Paris?

2
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,194
To visit my sister.
She's having a baby.

3
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,206
She's married to a Frenchman.

4
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:57,937
l mean, her husband's French.
She's a poet.

5
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,278
- Bon journée.
- Bon journée.

6
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:13,982
Tou want those berries, huh?

7
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,054
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

8
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,691
Artichokes...

9
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,701
asparagus.

10
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:28,540
In the 1 7 th century,
well-bred women never ate asparagus.

11
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,542
Especially white asparagus.

12
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,171
Really. It was considered
bad for reproduction.

13
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:37,307
The Princess de Clèves
would never have had any.

14
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,442
Really? l'll take it anyway.

15
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,181
l love it.
So does my husband.

16
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,621
And l'm pregnant.

17
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:47,922
In any case,
it's still a good diuretic.

18
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,531
- Papa is home.
- Where are you going?

19
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,065
What's wrong?

20
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:05,610
l'm sorry.

21
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,646
- Where are you going?
- l'm sorry, Roxeanne.

22
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,773
l'll call you. l'm sorry.

23
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,181
- l'll call you. No, don't.
- Talk to me. Don't...

24
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,720
- Just...
- No, no, don't. Don't.

25
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:17,085
- Why are you doing this?
- Don't, Roxeanne.

26
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:19,317
Charles-Henri!

27
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:32,027
- Just tell me where you're going.
- l'll call you.

28
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,540
Are you coming back?

29
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:49,488
- Are you free? Ah, Isabel.
- Hey! Hi.

30
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,750
l'm sorry. l am in a hurry.
l have got to go.

31
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,758
Okay.

32
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:58,063
l'll see you later.

33
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,294
- Thank you, mademoiselle.
- Good-bye.

34
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,938
Looking for someone?

35
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,475
Roxy de Persand, my sister.

36
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,207
Tou sound just like her.

37
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,274
Let me help. l'll call her.

38
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,411
Oh. Thank you.

39
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,930
l'll buzz her.

40
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,067
Mrs. de Persand?

41
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,626
It's just up there on the right.

42
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,639
Hey, where was
Charles-Henri going?

43
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,574
Uh, he had to go to the country
to see about one of his paintings.

44
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:47,306
- Well? What do you think?
- l love the beams in the ceilings.

45
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,507
They look like the ones
we have in Santa Barbara. Hi.

46
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,516
Oh, no, no.
Those are the fake ones.

47
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,781
These are the real
load-bearing ones.

48
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,948
She looks so much better here
than she ever did at home.

49
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,992
Papa did that picture.

50
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,459
- He did?
- Yeah, and he did that one too.

51
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,827
- Ooh!
- And he did this one too.

52
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:08,025
- Yeah?
- And that's the two dog one.

53
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,035
Two dogs?
Did Charles-Henri go to the country...

54
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,230
to sell a picture to somebody
or to paint one?

55
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,239
l'm not sure.

56
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,239
This is the tricky part.

57
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,457
Here it is.

58
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,396
It was a maid's room,
but these days you have no idea...

59
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,456
what a space like this is worth.

60
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:44,833
And of course it makes
a wonderful place to work in.

61
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,702
Look at the view.

62
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:51,210
There's a present for you
in the orange purse.

63
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,211
- This one?
- Yeah.

64
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,908
l hope you're not gonna
feel too cramped up here.

65
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,918
Oh, no.

66
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,920
Oh.

67
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,215
- Oh, it's beautiful.
- Tou like it?

68
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:10,285
- Yeah.
- Let me put it on you.

69
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:19,065
Thank you.

70
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,845
l think...

71
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,339
Charles-Henri has left me.

72
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,680
What?

73
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:38,055
Did something happen?
Is he having an affair?

74
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,115
l don't know what's going on.

75
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:43,185
l don't even know where he is.

76
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:47,062
And what am l gonna tell his family
at their Sunday lunch?

77
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:51,069
Tou tell them exactly what you told me.
That he's in the country.

78
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,367
No, but they're in the country.

79
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,878
If l were to tell my French friends
that Charles-Henri had walked out...

80
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,882
they'd say, "Of course."

81
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,441
The French always say
"of course" to everything.

82
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,079
Like everything
is absolutely normal.

83
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,953
C'est normale.
Mais bien sûr.

84
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,450
l'll never say, "But of course."

85
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,497
There's my brother-in-law,
Antoine.

86
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,590
- Oh, he's kinda cute.
- Tou think?

87
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,864
- Yeah.
- Anyway, he's married.

88
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,428
Whatever that means nowadays.

89
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,389
We saw a car on fire!

90
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,829
Really? How dangerous!

91
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,571
Our adorable Isabel, welcome.

92
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,664
- Thank you.
- Where's Charles-Henri?

93
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,801
He had to go to the country
to see some people about a painting.

94
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,244
Of course. Come inside.

95
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,713
Isabel, right here,
next to my brother, Edgar...

96
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,719
called Palou in the family.

97
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,812
He'll take very good care of you.

98
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,551
And my son, Antoine,
on the other side.

99
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:25,154
Charlotte, here. And my darling,
Roxeanne, next to me.

100
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:29,895
Oh, what good fortune to have two
such lovely American girls with us today.

101
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,665
Are you also a poet
like your sister Roxeanne?

102
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,104
Oh, no.
Roxy's always been the smart one.

103
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,301
She inherited
all of our father's brains.

104
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:39,867
l'm just the poor little half sister.

105
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,176
Really? Just like Cinderella.

106
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,148
Where in the country?

107
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,548
To see a buyer about a painting.

108
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,280
Of course.

109
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,323
- Calmez-vous les enfants.

110
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,018
Lamb raised near Mont St. Michel.

111
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,187
- l went to see Mont St. Michel!
- Ah, oui?

112
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,630
What do you think
of that senator of yours?

113
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,101
The chap that kept a diary
of all his sexual exploits.

114
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,505
l'm sorry?

115
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,666
Oh, perhaps you haven't been
following the affair...

116
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:12,210
with the same eagerness
as we have.

117
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:16,715
We're fully informed about his
secretaries who were so obliging to him.

118
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:20,513
Very discretely he calls them
only "S-One"... "S"for sex.

119
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:23,885
- S-Two, S-Three.
- S- Four.

120
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,890
- S-Five. S-Six.
- No, no.

121
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,392
- Gennie, that's enough.
- S- Seven.

122
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,895
And when he asked S-One,
or was it S-Four...

123
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:34,421
to explain the power he had over her,
she said it was his hair.

124
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,560
Apparently he blow-dries it
not using any gel...

125
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,765
so that it always comes out
with the right amount of...

126
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,536
- Uh, bounce?
- Yes.

127
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:46,942
Why? Why are adultery
and fornication...

128
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,880
treated as
the greatest joke on Earth?

129
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,782
l don't think they're always so comic.

130
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,945
Me too.

131
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,319
Well, many things in this world...

132
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,917
can be treated as tragedy
rather than comedy.

133
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,188
Such as old senators
who like pretty young women.

134
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:11,701
Also, l'm free
to watch Gennie whenever you want.

135
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,705
It's no problem whatsoever.

136
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:17,209
- Hello?

137
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:21,440
- Can you do me a favor?
- Where are you? Tell me.

138
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:25,473
l forgot my contact lenses.
Can we meet at the Flore?

139
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,476
Why? Why can't you come here?

140
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:32,957
Gennie's asking for you.
What am l supposed to tell her?

141
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:36,927
Tell her... l'm thinking
of her all the time.

142
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,226
- And me?
- What did you say?

143
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,528
Are you thinking of me?

144
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,535
Sure l am.
l'm thinking of all of us.

145
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:48,664
Do you...
Do you still love me?

146
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:52,142
So you don't wanna
bring them? Okay.

147
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,145
Don't hang up.
J'arrive.

148
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,481
l'm going out.

149
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,389
Charles-Henri
wants me to meet him.

150
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:10,623
- l'll go with you.
- No, you don't have to.

151
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,630
l want to.

152
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,662
l can't believe l agreed to do this.

153
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,671
Why don't l just let him
walk all over me?

154
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:23,106
- Hey, hey, les filles!
- Did you hear that?

155
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:27,134
- No. What did he say?
- Tou don't wanna know.

156
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,911
Did you invite us for a drink?

157
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:03,278
l think l'll take the... What's
that thing that tastes like licorice?

158
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,045
- Ricard.
- Roxy, here you are.

159
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,518
l've been trying to call you.

160
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:11,385
Mrs. Pace. So nice to see you.

161
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,255
Charles-Henri.

162
00:13:18,263 --> 00:13:20,254
Where is he going?
Did l say something?

163
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,266
He's going to the country.

164
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:25,667
Oh. Well, come on.
Let's have a drink.

165
00:13:30,475 --> 00:13:32,636
- And you would like?
- A Ricard.

166
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:35,509
A Ricard for the lady.

167
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,481
Roxy, what are you allowed to drink now?
What? Three months?

168
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:43,787
l'm Isabel.

169
00:13:43,855 --> 00:13:47,347
Oh, l'm sorry, this is my sister.
Olivia, Isabel.

170
00:13:47,425 --> 00:13:49,450
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

171
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:52,759
Roxy, l need you desperately.

172
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:57,268
The University ofTulsa,
my alma mater...

173
00:13:57,335 --> 00:14:00,395
has bought all my papers and things,
which are in a terrible mess...

174
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,804
and l was wondering
if you would consider...

175
00:14:02,874 --> 00:14:04,865
l mean, you're the first person
l thought of...

176
00:14:04,943 --> 00:14:07,969
helping me put them
in some kind of order.

177
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:12,740
Now is not a good time for you.

178
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:14,978
Isabel is looking for a job.

179
00:14:15,053 --> 00:14:18,716
Yeah, you are. Tou can't babysit
Gennie and me forever.

180
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,281
She's done all kinds of courses.

181
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:23,884
Art history, film. What else?

182
00:14:23,962 --> 00:14:25,987
Comparative Literature
and Depth Psychology?

183
00:14:26,064 --> 00:14:30,501
Good. That means you can read and write,
and you're just the person l need.

184
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:33,003
- Do you know how to prepare a Ricard?
- Not really.

185
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:35,733
Add a little water.

186
00:14:35,807 --> 00:14:38,139
There you go.
Some ice, and you stir.

187
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,471
Bravo. Bravo.

188
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:15,742
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah.

189
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:19,113
Excuse me.
Are you Gennie's babysitter?

190
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:21,778
- She's my aunt.
- l'm sorry.

191
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:24,879
This is for Gennie's mom.
Last month's bill.

192
00:15:24,956 --> 00:15:28,448
- She must have forgotten.
- Okay, d'accord.

193
00:15:28,526 --> 00:15:33,054
Tell her how much l like Gennie.
She's talented, lively.

194
00:15:33,131 --> 00:15:36,396
l enjoy having her in my class.

195
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:39,835
Don't forget your pirouette.
Practice!

196
00:15:39,904 --> 00:15:41,838
Merci. Au revoir.

197
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:44,898
Roxy's taken
a wrong turn in life...

198
00:15:44,976 --> 00:15:47,809
and for all we know, Isabel,
you may be going the same way.

199
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,712
- Does Roxy have any money?
- Does Roxy have any money?

200
00:15:50,782 --> 00:15:52,773
l don't know.
She never talks about it.

201
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:55,820
But she never talks about anything.
It's like she's in some sort of denial.

202
00:15:55,887 --> 00:15:58,583
l knew this would happen.
l knew the day they got married.

203
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,591
Roger wants to talk to you.
Here.

204
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:04,557
Listen, Is, do not let Roxy...

205
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:07,689
allow Charles-Henri
to take the Saint Ursula painting.

206
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:11,600
In case he comes to get his stuff,
he should not get the idea that it's his.

207
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,662
Right. Saint Ursula's right here.
l'm looking right at her.

208
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:17,572
Hang on.

209
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:20,133
Darling, just remember,
we love you both.

210
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:22,202
Bye, honey.
Talk to you soon.

211
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:29,279
- So what'd she say?
- Roxy's miserable.

212
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:32,619
What'd she say about the painting?
It's not just hers, you know.

213
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:36,388
It belongs to all of us. Tou never
should have let her take it over there.

214
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:38,952
Tou know that woman from the Getty?

215
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,760
She said it could've been painted
by a student of Georges de La Tour.

216
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,666
And maybe bits of it could've been done
by Georges La Tour himself.

217
00:16:44,736 --> 00:16:47,705
l mean, now he's just this huge star.
Of course, we had no idea.

218
00:16:47,772 --> 00:16:51,469
That's it. If it's valuable enough for them
to borrow it, we have to get it back.

219
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:54,273
It would be wonderful to have
a painting hanging in a museum.

220
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:59,648
"From the collection of Professor and
Mrs. Chester Walker of Santa Barbara. "

221
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:02,585
Tou people are just incapable
of concentrating on essentials.

222
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:05,316
That's right.

223
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,382
Our girls are thousands of miles away
and they should be home with us.

224
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,758
That's the essentials.

225
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,423
- Honey.
- What?

226
00:17:33,818 --> 00:17:36,252
- Thank you.
- Tou're welcome.

227
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:42,688
So, Charles-Henri's mother
has been very nice.

228
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:48,290
She calls all the time, takes us
to lunch at expensive restaurants.

229
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:51,631
Roxy thinks Suzanne
is just pretending to be on her side...

230
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:54,695
and that, in reality,
her son can do no wrong.

231
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,571
All French mothers
are crazy about their sons.

232
00:17:57,642 --> 00:17:59,803
French women are extraordinary.

233
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:03,211
l'm thinking of writing a little book
about them and their native habitat.

234
00:18:03,281 --> 00:18:05,272
All their customs and ceremonials.

235
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,511
l mean, their scarves alone...

236
00:18:07,585 --> 00:18:09,746
an entire chapter.

237
00:18:09,821 --> 00:18:14,520
Knotted in front, one end down,
other end thrown over the shoulder.

238
00:18:14,592 --> 00:18:18,460
Or looped around double
and the ends tucked in.

239
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,727
Or around the shoulder,
over their coat like a shawl.

240
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:27,397
Or tied in the back.
l mean, châle, foulard, ècharpe.

241
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:30,032
Just think of all the words
they have for scarf.

242
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:33,635
And in a language which is
very sparse in vocabulary.

243
00:18:36,581 --> 00:18:39,311
- So, do you intend to stay?
- In Paris?

244
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:42,547
- Mm.
- Maybe.

245
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:46,419
If it works out, l'd like to.

246
00:18:46,491 --> 00:18:50,086
- Why not?
- l'm thinking of going home soon.

247
00:18:50,161 --> 00:18:52,152
After all this is done.

248
00:18:53,331 --> 00:18:55,822
l bought a house
on the coast of Maine.

249
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,892
l dream about it
night after night.

250
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:02,064
The bare rock, the cold sea.

251
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,041
Yves. This is Isabel.

252
00:19:05,109 --> 00:19:07,703
- It's Roxy's sister. This is Yves.
- Hi.

253
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,713
- It's okay. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

254
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,715
Yves is helping me out
painting the guest room.

255
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:14,115
Yves is marvelous
and he walks Flaubert.

256
00:19:14,185 --> 00:19:16,176
Doesn't he, darling? Yes.

257
00:19:16,254 --> 00:19:19,246
He doesn't think that Flaubert's
just a mere chien.

258
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,554
Well, you're not a mere chien.

259
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:24,459
Make friends, you two.
Show her the real Paris.

260
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:46,776
Wait, wait.

261
00:19:49,487 --> 00:19:52,752
There are people here
who want America to control France.

262
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:55,156
They want us to watch cartoons...

263
00:19:55,226 --> 00:19:57,717
and they want to paint
Donald Duck on everything.

264
00:19:57,795 --> 00:20:00,628
And we are all
supposed to drink Coke.

265
00:20:00,698 --> 00:20:04,031
l don't watch cartoons
or read comic books.

266
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,570
How come you do?
Tou must like them.

267
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:09,129
Tou have an immunity to it
from growing up on it.

268
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:13,371
Here itjust sweeps through,
like measles through the Amazon.

269
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,978
How weird to be culturally
threatened by a cartoon.

270
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:22,746
l'm not threatened.

271
00:20:24,522 --> 00:20:26,683
It's Uncle Edgar.

272
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:30,759
It's our relative. He's on TV.

273
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,958
Look, she's in love with him.

274
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,159
Now she's going to
sit on his lap.

275
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:38,702
He does have a lot of sex appeal.

276
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,965
Oh, yeah?

277
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,702
l'll take your word for it.
He's really old.

278
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,267
He's not that old.
He's only 5 5.

279
00:20:47,345 --> 00:20:51,076
How do you know that?

280
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,515
Is that what he told you?

281
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,519
Don't. l want to watch.

282
00:20:55,587 --> 00:21:00,490
l've never known anybody who's been
on TV before, talking about world events.

283
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:07,290
Tou can't understand
a word he says.

284
00:21:07,365 --> 00:21:10,163
- So, what is he saying?
- Abortion. He's against it.

285
00:21:10,234 --> 00:21:12,998
He's against abortion?

286
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:16,336
It's all based on some
very profound fascist philosophy.

287
00:21:16,407 --> 00:21:19,001
- It's also a lot of crap.
- Hey, l wanna watch it.

288
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:24,140
Isabel, give it to me.
Come on. Isabel. All right.

289
00:21:28,886 --> 00:21:30,478
Give it to me.

290
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,817
Ah, yes, sugar, please.

291
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:36,053
Oh.! Original.

292
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:40,359
We do have a cousin who uses
grains of sugar instead of cubes.

293
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,696
It has happened to other women.

294
00:21:43,768 --> 00:21:48,535
They will all tell you,
"Go with life as it unrolls."

295
00:21:48,606 --> 00:21:51,336
Maybe it will be a boy.

296
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:53,741
- Yes, a boy.
- A son and heir.

297
00:21:55,246 --> 00:21:58,738
l can't believe this.
l'm in a novel by Balzac.

298
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:04,077
l'm not sure if l wanna bring
a child into a broken home.

299
00:22:07,825 --> 00:22:12,319
Tou don't want to act hastily
in such an important matter.

300
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,759
l'll get some more hot water.

301
00:22:17,335 --> 00:22:19,997
Please reflect on this, Roxeanne.

302
00:22:25,476 --> 00:22:29,207
- Roxeanne is not herself.
- How can she be?

303
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,408
This is very, very unfortunate.

304
00:22:33,918 --> 00:22:36,751
Deplorable.

305
00:22:38,856 --> 00:22:41,882
So good of you, Isabel,
to have come to be with her.

306
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:44,587
And l hear that you've
already found employment.

307
00:22:44,662 --> 00:22:47,153
Yes, l'm working with Olivia Pace,
the American writer.

308
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:49,222
l really must get something ofhers.

309
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,600
Who was she?

310
00:22:55,673 --> 00:22:58,437
Was she German? Flemish?

311
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:03,105
Saint Ursula was the patron saint of all
young girls, whatever their nationality.

312
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:05,672
How many virgins do they say
were martyred with her?

313
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,310
- Eleven thousand.
- That's a lot.

314
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,581
But it's a charming legend.

315
00:23:16,127 --> 00:23:19,290
- What are you doing?
- Didn't you hear her?

316
00:23:19,363 --> 00:23:23,197
"Sugar grains. Original."
Meaning how bizarre.

317
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:26,964
Meaning, "Why don't you have sugar cubes
like a proper French girl?"

318
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,007
- It's her fault too.

319
00:23:30,074 --> 00:23:32,338
She's completely spoiled
both her sons.

320
00:23:34,712 --> 00:23:37,704
Tou didn't tell me you were thinking
of not having the baby.

321
00:23:37,782 --> 00:23:40,273
Of course l'm having it.

322
00:23:40,351 --> 00:23:43,616
l just wanted to shake her up,
that's all.

323
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:46,657
My husband no longer lives at home.

324
00:23:46,724 --> 00:23:49,852
Tou're the innocent party.
Tou can file a suit.

325
00:23:51,028 --> 00:23:53,963
l don't want to.
It's all my husband's idea.

326
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:57,233
If Mr. de Persand
took you to court...

327
00:23:57,301 --> 00:23:59,462
he'd need to make a case.

328
00:23:59,537 --> 00:24:02,563
Violence, cruelty, adultery.

329
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,870
He couldn't possibly say
any of those things.

330
00:24:04,942 --> 00:24:06,876
No, of course not.

331
00:24:06,944 --> 00:24:09,071
The offense is totally mine.

332
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:11,342
The injured party asks for divorce.

333
00:24:11,415 --> 00:24:13,906
l keep telling you,
l don't want a divorce.

334
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:17,622
l oppose divorce on principle,
entirely and utterly.

335
00:24:17,755 --> 00:24:20,918
There is also the question
of division of property.

336
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:24,325
Unfortunately, you have signed
a prenuptial agreement.

337
00:24:24,395 --> 00:24:26,886
That complicates matters.

338
00:24:26,964 --> 00:24:29,694
Tou are entitled to half
of your wife's property...

339
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:32,258
and Madame de Persand
has the same claim on yours.

340
00:24:32,336 --> 00:24:35,601
l don't want anything
from the apartment.

341
00:24:35,673 --> 00:24:38,005
Things that came
from my family, perhaps.

342
00:24:38,075 --> 00:24:40,168
l'll let my mother
and brother decide...

343
00:24:40,244 --> 00:24:42,405
if there's anything that
shouldn't go out of the family.

344
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,641
Tour children are your family.

345
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:47,343
Things going to your children
are not going out of your family.

346
00:24:47,418 --> 00:24:50,979
- l was thinking of things going to the U.S.
- l'm not going to the U.S.

347
00:24:51,055 --> 00:24:53,683
l am staying right here.

348
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,861
When would remarriage
be permitted?

349
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,864
Once divorce is granted...

350
00:25:01,932 --> 00:25:05,368
you're perfectly free to remarry.

351
00:25:05,436 --> 00:25:09,395
But your wife must wait
until she gives birth.

352
00:25:09,473 --> 00:25:13,637
That's unbelievable. In California,
l could remarry as soon as l wanted.

353
00:25:13,711 --> 00:25:17,203
Do you mean to tell me that in France
the law is different for men and women?

354
00:25:17,281 --> 00:25:20,739
- For obvious reasons.
- No, it isn't obvious to me.
l don't want to listen to this.

355
00:25:20,818 --> 00:25:23,946
It's not me who's asked for a divorce.
l don't want a divorce.

356
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:26,649
And l really don't wanna see you...

357
00:25:26,724 --> 00:25:29,852
or speak to you or sit in
the same room with you ever again.

358
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:34,097
Bastard!

359
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:03,787
During my research
for an exhibition catalogue...

360
00:26:03,861 --> 00:26:08,628
l ran across a piece in the inventory
of the estate of a Dr. William Walker.

361
00:26:08,699 --> 00:26:10,633
- Our father's uncle.
- Exactly.

362
00:26:10,701 --> 00:26:14,330
Tour uncle bought it in the 1 930s in
the Rue du Bac in Paris from a dealer...

363
00:26:14,405 --> 00:26:16,930
and it was still in the inventory
of his estate...

364
00:26:17,007 --> 00:26:19,168
at the time ofhis death in 1 979.

365
00:26:19,243 --> 00:26:21,404
It then passed into the possession...

366
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:25,142
of a Dr. Chester Walker
of Santa Barbara, your father.

367
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:28,242
- l tracked it down in the court records.
- Did l hear you say...

368
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,050
the insurance value, when we ship it
to the Getty, is $40,000?

369
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:34,683
- Yes, at least that. Yeah.
- And to think, all these years...

370
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,990
it's been hanging in total obscurity
in our house in Santa Barbara.

371
00:26:38,062 --> 00:26:40,326
God, Roxy, would you ever believe
this would've happened?

372
00:26:40,397 --> 00:26:42,558
See, what's so incredible
to us at the Getty...

373
00:26:42,633 --> 00:26:47,297
is that no one here saw that it
had any resemblance to La Tour.

374
00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:50,704
The French are always so very quick
to claim anything good as their own.

375
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,369
Hmm. Sounds like
my husband and his lawyer.

376
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:00,010
Can you believe they're talking
about division of property?

377
00:27:02,086 --> 00:27:05,749
Oh, l'm usually the cautious
museum curator...

378
00:27:05,823 --> 00:27:08,815
but l have a fair hunch...

379
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:11,885
that this may be
by La Tour himself.

380
00:27:11,962 --> 00:27:14,556
Well, there are a lot of little things
and they all add up.

381
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:18,659
If you see,
there's his palette, his color.

382
00:27:18,736 --> 00:27:21,500
See especially...
See how the light from the candle...

383
00:27:21,572 --> 00:27:23,631
shows through the servant's sleeve.

384
00:27:23,707 --> 00:27:25,868
Tou see that, Roxy?

385
00:27:25,943 --> 00:27:27,877
Tou see the light?

386
00:27:32,783 --> 00:27:36,742
My wonderful friends, thank you
so much for being here today.

387
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,722
- Tou seem to be having a good time.

388
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,724
Yes, but that is not why you're here.

389
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:44,022
This is a fund-raiser. l repeat:

390
00:27:46,463 --> 00:27:49,955
Now, as you all know,
Action Alert is in its first year.

391
00:27:50,034 --> 00:27:51,968
We've made wonderful progress...

392
00:27:52,036 --> 00:27:55,199
helping women
in besieged countries the world over.

393
00:27:55,272 --> 00:27:59,299
Today they're the victims.
Tomorrow, who knows.

394
00:27:59,376 --> 00:28:04,871
Because the world is ruled by hawks
and arms dealers and minority phobias.

395
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:09,545
So, l hope you brought your checkbooks.
[In French]

396
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:13,021
And if you didn't, please,
empty your pockets of all your cash...

397
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:15,388
- because you can always
go home on the métro.

398
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,271
There's someone
l want you to meet.

399
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:30,273
He is a lawyer who
specializes in divorce.

400
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:33,367
- Oh, no, please.
- His firm has connections with America.

401
00:28:33,444 --> 00:28:35,935
l couldn't stand to hear
another lawyer talk about divorce.

402
00:28:36,013 --> 00:28:38,345
By consent,
by mutual consent, by action.

403
00:28:38,415 --> 00:28:41,475
Maître Bertram,
Madame de Persand.

404
00:28:41,552 --> 00:28:45,283
- Her sister, Isabel.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

405
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:48,325
Now, l have talked with Maître Bertram
about your Saint Ursula...

406
00:28:48,392 --> 00:28:51,020
and he does not think it's a good idea
that you send her to California.

407
00:28:51,095 --> 00:28:53,928
Could l advise you?

408
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:56,193
If you were to send your picture
to the Getty Museum...

409
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:58,360
it might seem a trick
to get it out of France...

410
00:28:58,435 --> 00:29:00,369
and that might jeopardize
the rest of the divorce.

411
00:29:00,437 --> 00:29:03,065
It could be interpreted
as an act of bad faith.

412
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,973
What if l just rolled it up
and took it in my suitcase?

413
00:29:06,043 --> 00:29:08,307
Tou could invite charges
that might lead to imprisonment.

414
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:12,213
- That's out then.
- It would be an experience.

415
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:15,775
l don't think you'd like to experience
a French jail, mademoiselle.

416
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:19,455
Nice to meet you.

417
00:29:20,457 --> 00:29:22,391
If you need anything.

418
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:26,957
What's it like in a French prison?

419
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:30,194
At Fresne, they have uniforms
designed by Yves Saint Laurent.

420
00:29:31,201 --> 00:29:33,499
- No. Tou're serious?
- Yeah.

421
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:36,368
They also have a full-time coiffeur.

422
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,603
- How do you know all this?
- l visit a friend there. Kelly.

423
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:41,645
She's American too.

424
00:29:41,712 --> 00:29:45,375
- What is she in for? Drugs?
- No, currency.

425
00:29:45,449 --> 00:29:47,917
But if you're really looking
for a new experience...

426
00:29:47,985 --> 00:29:49,976
come to Action Alert on Thursday.

427
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:53,546
Every Thursday we ship supplies
to the refugees your...

428
00:29:53,624 --> 00:29:56,855
sexy uncle Edgar
wants to blow up.

429
00:30:25,255 --> 00:30:27,917
How is Gennie?
l miss her so much.

430
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:31,120
She misses you.
She asks about you all the time.

431
00:30:32,196 --> 00:30:35,029
l love her.
And l love Roxy too.

432
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:39,198
l'm helpless, Isabel.

433
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:43,103
l know l am absolutely in the wrong,
but there's nothing l can do about it.

434
00:30:43,173 --> 00:30:46,870
Roxy should understand that.
She's a poet.

435
00:30:46,944 --> 00:30:50,243
Another artist
with so much imagination.

436
00:30:50,314 --> 00:30:53,306
l know this sounds romantic
in the wrong sort of way.

437
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:55,852
It's just that it's inevitable.

438
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,252
l met the woman of my life
and l want to be only with her.

439
00:31:01,992 --> 00:31:04,426
Her name is Magda Tellman.

440
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:07,623
She's Russian,
but she's married to an American.

441
00:31:07,698 --> 00:31:10,258
l'm painting better than
l've ever done in my life, Isabel.

442
00:31:10,334 --> 00:31:13,326
l feel like for the first time
l've arrived at certainty.

443
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:16,601
- Not certainty. Certitude?
- Either one.

444
00:31:22,012 --> 00:31:24,480
Aren't you going to make
the introduction, chéri?

445
00:31:24,548 --> 00:31:28,245
- l'm Magda.
- Isabel Walker.

446
00:31:38,562 --> 00:31:41,190
Roxeanne?
Are you Roxeanne?

447
00:31:42,266 --> 00:31:44,200
No, l'm Isabel.

448
00:31:44,268 --> 00:31:46,429
Oh, you're the sister.

449
00:31:46,503 --> 00:31:48,437
Yeah.

450
00:31:50,874 --> 00:31:52,808
Are you a friend of Roxy's?

451
00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:55,470
Yeah, you could say that. Tou could say
we have something in common.

452
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:58,447
l thought l'd like to meet her,
you see?

453
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,782
l don't think she's home.

454
00:32:05,055 --> 00:32:06,989
l'm her husband.

455
00:32:07,057 --> 00:32:10,390
l'm Magda Tellman's husband.
The husband.

456
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:18,661
Tell your sister this message
for me, will ya?

457
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:23,696
Tell her that l will never
give Magda a divorce.

458
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:27,541
Never! Never.

459
00:32:27,611 --> 00:32:30,375
Tour sister can make
her plans accordingly.

460
00:32:30,447 --> 00:32:32,381
- What? Excuse me?
- l've made mine.

461
00:32:32,449 --> 00:32:34,610
That's her umbrella.

462
00:32:34,685 --> 00:32:36,619
My umbrella.!

463
00:32:40,657 --> 00:32:43,023
l've seen him
lurking about before.

464
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:46,062
l can smell guys
like that a mile away.

465
00:32:54,171 --> 00:32:56,537
- Hi.

466
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:59,576
Hi.

467
00:32:59,643 --> 00:33:02,476
"We thank you for your submission,
but regret that..."

468
00:33:02,546 --> 00:33:05,538
- Blah, blah, blah, blah.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

469
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:10,952
Roxy. Rox. Tour poems
are beautiful, okay?

470
00:33:11,021 --> 00:33:15,219
- And so are you.
- Oh, yeah. Beautiful.

471
00:33:17,561 --> 00:33:20,553
l was never like this with Gennie.

472
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:24,465
Of course, l was in love then
and we were gonna get married.

473
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:27,527
To hell with Charles-Henri.

474
00:33:27,604 --> 00:33:31,096
Roxy, go out
and get yourself a boyfriend.

475
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:34,110
Five months' pregnant.
Have you lost your mind?

476
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,112
It will pass.

477
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,171
Anyway, you should
get out of here now.

478
00:33:38,248 --> 00:33:42,048
Mom and Dad want you to come home.
l want you to come home.

479
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:44,781
And listen to all the l-told-you-sos?
No.

480
00:33:44,855 --> 00:33:48,951
Besides, my children belong here,
and l belong with them.

481
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:51,586
It's Palou.

482
00:34:02,739 --> 00:34:05,708
- What's he saying?
- He's sort of a warmonger.

483
00:34:05,776 --> 00:34:08,267
He's always got some moral reason
for sending French planes out...

484
00:34:08,345 --> 00:34:10,836
to bomb places he doesn't like.

485
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:14,810
Ow!

486
00:34:14,885 --> 00:34:17,353
- Oh, l'm sorry, honey.
- l'm all right.

487
00:34:20,757 --> 00:34:22,520
Does he have a wife?

488
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:26,996
Edgar? Yeah, sure.
Aunt Amèlie.

489
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,166
Why do we never see her?

490
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:33,032
She's mostly down in the country
with her horses.

491
00:34:33,103 --> 00:34:35,833
They stay out of each other's way.
l'm told they get along all right.

492
00:34:35,906 --> 00:34:39,398
l like her.
Mother would like her too.

493
00:34:39,476 --> 00:34:42,468
- What about kids?
- Twins.

494
00:34:42,546 --> 00:34:46,949
Two boys. One at the Sorbonne,
and one at Harvard Business School.

495
00:34:47,017 --> 00:34:50,145
That's where Edgar went too.
Come on.

496
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,450
- Have a good time.
- Don't forget your hat.

497
00:34:54,024 --> 00:34:56,185
- See you later.
- Bye.

498
00:35:07,802 --> 00:35:11,533
Everyone forgets
the suffering of this people.

499
00:35:11,606 --> 00:35:14,700
Mr. Rabourdin doesn't agree.

500
00:35:19,547 --> 00:35:22,812
- Oh, hi. Hello? Edgar?
- Yes.

501
00:35:22,884 --> 00:35:24,875
Monsieur Cosset, it's Isabel.

502
00:35:24,953 --> 00:35:29,219
- Ah, the other American.
- l saw you on television.

503
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:32,384
l just thought it was so...

504
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,451
so great, the way you
stood up to those guys.

505
00:35:34,529 --> 00:35:37,054
Well, l feel very passionate
about the situation.

506
00:35:37,132 --> 00:35:39,259
It's time someone spoke out.

507
00:35:39,334 --> 00:35:41,666
But your French must be good
if you can follow all that.

508
00:35:41,736 --> 00:35:45,228
Well, l had a little help from Roxy.

509
00:35:45,306 --> 00:35:49,504
Well, then why don't we get together
so you can polish your French even more?

510
00:35:49,577 --> 00:35:51,875
What about Thursday?
Are you taken for lunch?

511
00:35:51,946 --> 00:35:54,107
- No.
- Do you know the Pompidou Center?

512
00:35:54,182 --> 00:35:57,618
1.00. Up on the roof.
Café Georges.

513
00:36:00,255 --> 00:36:03,122
- Bonjour, madame.
- Mr. Cosset. Yeah.

514
00:36:11,933 --> 00:36:13,867
Bonjour. Hi.

515
00:36:16,037 --> 00:36:19,131
- Thank you.
- He might be a little jealous.

516
00:36:21,743 --> 00:36:23,973
Say, "Bonjour, Edgar,"
not just "Bonjour."

517
00:36:24,045 --> 00:36:26,843
Bonjour, Edgar.

518
00:36:26,915 --> 00:36:29,440
- That's a beautiful haircut.
- Thank you.

519
00:36:29,517 --> 00:36:33,544
Is... Is that Notre Dame over there?
Right down there?

520
00:36:33,621 --> 00:36:35,885
- No, this is Sainte-Marie.
- Sainte-Marie.

521
00:36:35,957 --> 00:36:39,620
Notre Dame is there.
They are cleaning it again.

522
00:36:39,694 --> 00:36:42,561
- It's huge.
- One of the specialties is Salade de crabe.

523
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:45,997
l always order it.
What about you?

524
00:36:50,038 --> 00:36:53,030
l guess l'll have the rôti D'Agn...

525
00:36:53,108 --> 00:36:54,837
- D'Agneau.
- D'Agneau.

526
00:36:54,909 --> 00:36:57,639
- That's roast lamb, isn't it?
- Yes.

527
00:36:57,712 --> 00:37:00,237
Hungry for red meat
at all times.

528
00:37:00,315 --> 00:37:02,715
That is not true.

529
00:37:02,784 --> 00:37:05,947
Only once in a while,
and not raw and dripping with blood...

530
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,079
and butter and cream.

531
00:37:08,156 --> 00:37:10,090
Just a good steak.

532
00:37:18,233 --> 00:37:20,292
Parfait.

533
00:37:21,469 --> 00:37:24,597
- l really like this haircut.
- Tou do?

534
00:37:24,672 --> 00:37:27,038
What happened to you?
Tou said you'd be there on Thursday.

535
00:37:27,108 --> 00:37:30,600
l should've called you.
l had to take Gennie to her ballet class.

536
00:37:30,678 --> 00:37:33,044
- Yves.
- Yeah.

537
00:37:33,114 --> 00:37:36,777
When you meet somebody, do you say,
"Bonjour, Monsieur whatever"?

538
00:37:36,851 --> 00:37:40,184
Or, "Bonjour, monsieur"?
Or just "Bonjour"?

539
00:37:40,255 --> 00:37:43,019
What sort of
a stupid question is that?

540
00:37:43,091 --> 00:37:46,083
There's another meeting
next Tuesday.

541
00:37:46,161 --> 00:37:49,688
- Same time, same place.
- l'll be there. Tuesday.

542
00:37:49,764 --> 00:37:53,291
1 25 Rue des Écoles.

543
00:38:06,714 --> 00:38:08,944
Isabel, action! Are you alert?

544
00:38:09,017 --> 00:38:12,748
Tuesday, remember?
Action Alert. l told you.

545
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:16,153
Where are you?
Are you lost?

546
00:38:16,524 --> 00:38:18,424
Merci.

547
00:38:20,628 --> 00:38:23,222
Tou didn't mind my changing
our rendezvous to Tuesday?

548
00:38:23,298 --> 00:38:26,165
Oh, no, no.
l wasn't doing anything special.

549
00:38:30,271 --> 00:38:32,501
Now...

550
00:38:32,574 --> 00:38:35,134
we must decide
if you will become my mistress.

551
00:38:37,979 --> 00:38:40,812
l've long since given up trying
to lure young women to my rooms...

552
00:38:40,882 --> 00:38:42,850
on other pretexts.

553
00:38:42,917 --> 00:38:45,181
l don't have any etchings.

554
00:38:48,089 --> 00:38:51,786
What do you mean
become your mistress?

555
00:38:51,859 --> 00:38:53,759
It means we become lovers...

556
00:38:53,828 --> 00:38:57,195
and spend a certain amount
of time together, like today...

557
00:38:57,265 --> 00:38:59,995
amusing ourselves.

558
00:39:00,068 --> 00:39:02,969
l know you amuse me,
and l think l can amuse you.

559
00:39:04,739 --> 00:39:07,799
And there is the fact
that l desire you.

560
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:10,537
Tou're a beautiful young woman.

561
00:39:17,385 --> 00:39:21,446
Well, when do we begin?
Or l begin, l guess l should say.

562
00:39:21,522 --> 00:39:25,288
Whenever you wish.
Very soon, l would wish.

563
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:32,522
We have to be awfully careful. We can't
tell our families about any of this.

564
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,866
It would not have occurred to me to
mention this to our families, my dear.

565
00:39:36,938 --> 00:39:38,633
On the contrary.

566
00:39:38,706 --> 00:39:41,732
- Why did you do that to your hair?
- What?

567
00:39:41,809 --> 00:39:45,802
Tour hair. It makes you look like
someone who reads Marie Claire.

568
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:51,216
Do you have any idea how much
this cost? A cut and a color?

569
00:40:11,105 --> 00:40:14,438
Is there something you like?

570
00:40:14,509 --> 00:40:17,535
- Um...
- Ah.!

571
00:40:17,612 --> 00:40:21,104
It's silk. Charming, sexy.

572
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:24,515
Men love it.

573
00:40:24,585 --> 00:40:27,383
We also have it in black,
red and purple.

574
00:40:27,455 --> 00:40:29,423
Which would you prefer?

575
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:34,325
Um, l don't know. Blue?

576
00:40:34,395 --> 00:40:38,092
Blue.
And the bra, with support?

577
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:40,532
With no support?

578
00:40:41,936 --> 00:40:43,904
- Sandrine.
- Bonjour.

579
00:40:43,971 --> 00:40:46,337
- Bonjour.
- This is without armature.

580
00:40:46,407 --> 00:40:51,401
- Do you like that?
- Oh. Je ne sais pas. Both.

581
00:40:51,479 --> 00:40:54,880
- What's your bra size?
- l'm a 34.

582
00:40:54,949 --> 00:40:59,511
34B.

583
00:40:59,587 --> 00:41:02,613
It's, uh, very small.

584
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:05,158
- Small.
- Tou're a French 85.

585
00:41:12,166 --> 00:41:16,034
- What do you like best?

586
00:41:16,104 --> 00:41:18,595
- What size do you like?
- Uh, small.

587
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:25,407
- Why should anyone appraise our property?

588
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,677
Tou heard what he said
about division of property.

589
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:31,844
l'm not gonna have people come
trampling all over my home...

590
00:41:31,919 --> 00:41:33,853
- which used to be your home too.

591
00:41:33,921 --> 00:41:35,821
Anyway, what property is there?

592
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:40,691
There's the bureau, some china,
my grandmother's plates.

593
00:41:40,762 --> 00:41:45,597
And the leather sofa
and your pictures and my Saint Ursula...

594
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:47,657
which doesn't belong to me.

595
00:41:47,735 --> 00:41:50,295
It belongs to my parents,
who are lending it to the Getty Museum.

596
00:41:50,371 --> 00:41:53,636
- Tou mean you're sending it to California?
- Yes, of course.

597
00:41:53,708 --> 00:41:55,801
- Why shouldn't I?
- l thought it belonged to us.

598
00:41:55,877 --> 00:41:59,540
- l have to go. There's someone at the door.

599
00:41:59,614 --> 00:42:01,548
Bye.

600
00:42:02,917 --> 00:42:05,545
l'll get it.

601
00:42:10,892 --> 00:42:12,951
Antoine.

602
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:38,310
- Yeah?

603
00:42:39,687 --> 00:42:41,814
It's for you.

604
00:42:45,793 --> 00:42:47,954
l spoke to Charles-Henri.

605
00:42:48,029 --> 00:42:51,692
He says Antoine's sending appraisers
to come look at our property.

606
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:56,192
Coming here? How awful.

607
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:58,261
And no one's even
filed any papers yet.

608
00:42:58,339 --> 00:43:01,467
It's like hejust can't wait
to get rid of me.

609
00:43:02,877 --> 00:43:05,107
Just don't let them in, that's all.

610
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:18,351
That must have been expensive.

611
00:43:18,426 --> 00:43:20,724
It was on sale.

612
00:43:20,795 --> 00:43:22,729
They said it was last year's model.

613
00:43:22,797 --> 00:43:26,358
It's called a Kelly,
after Grace Kelly.

614
00:43:26,434 --> 00:43:29,369
It was the sort of
zillion dollar purse she owned.

615
00:43:30,938 --> 00:43:32,906
Tou didn't buy that
for yourself, did you?

616
00:43:35,943 --> 00:43:39,310
It was a gift,
and l did someone a favor.

617
00:43:41,782 --> 00:43:46,116
Didn't anyone ever tell you not to
accept expensive gifts from men?

618
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:57,564
Anyway, you should give it back.

619
00:43:57,632 --> 00:43:59,566
Anyway, he wouldn't take it back.

620
00:43:59,634 --> 00:44:03,968
And anyway, why shouldn't one
accept an expensive gift from
a man if he wants to give it?

621
00:44:04,038 --> 00:44:07,496
Because it puts you in the position
of having to do what he wants.

622
00:44:07,575 --> 00:44:09,702
l'd do it anyway.

623
00:44:11,913 --> 00:44:16,407
It's a present, Rox,
not a payment or a bribe.

624
00:44:17,919 --> 00:44:20,683
Then l suppose you can accept it.

625
00:44:57,458 --> 00:44:59,392
Slow down. Slow down.

626
00:45:32,259 --> 00:45:34,193
Thank you.

627
00:45:44,438 --> 00:45:46,372
Wow.

628
00:45:54,582 --> 00:45:58,916
The famous "V." This is what
we call mettre en valeur.

629
00:45:58,986 --> 00:46:01,079
It means to highlight.

630
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:04,620
To show to advantage.

631
00:46:12,967 --> 00:46:16,300
- Very nice. Mm!

632
00:46:18,406 --> 00:46:20,738
Tou don't keep a diary, do you?

633
00:46:22,777 --> 00:46:26,736
Why? Are you afraid
that it might be...

634
00:46:26,814 --> 00:46:30,477
read on television
like the American senator's?

635
00:46:30,551 --> 00:46:33,884
l have no fear
of what you might write.

636
00:46:33,954 --> 00:46:38,789
l only hope your literary style will be
up to the French public's expectations.

637
00:46:43,264 --> 00:46:45,233
Tou're not, are you?

638
00:46:46,367 --> 00:46:48,699
There is a certain kind of tisane...

639
00:46:50,338 --> 00:46:54,001
made up of a mixture
of, uh, orange...

640
00:46:54,075 --> 00:46:56,908
rosewater and mint.

641
00:46:58,613 --> 00:47:01,275
It's to be drunk
before making love.

642
00:47:06,387 --> 00:47:08,321
What does it do?

643
00:47:11,058 --> 00:47:13,219
It perfumes the juices.

644
00:47:28,075 --> 00:47:31,909
That's something you would never
have found out in Santa Barbara.

645
00:47:36,517 --> 00:47:40,578
There are many things you would never
have found out in Santa Barbara.

646
00:47:48,763 --> 00:47:52,096
How much of the tisane
do you have to drink?

647
00:47:54,035 --> 00:47:57,698
A cup or just a tablespoon?

648
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:02,373
A whole teapot full
is recommended.

649
00:49:01,102 --> 00:49:03,036
Shh!

650
00:49:09,677 --> 00:49:11,975
- Come back for the reading.
About a half an hour.
- Okay, l will.

651
00:49:12,046 --> 00:49:14,537
- Thank you.
- Good.

652
00:49:19,954 --> 00:49:21,888
Oh, a Kelly.

653
00:49:21,956 --> 00:49:24,117
Tou must have an admirer.

654
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:28,892
And he must be French
and of a certain age.

655
00:49:34,869 --> 00:49:37,064
Such an honor to meet you.
To Anne, please.

656
00:49:37,138 --> 00:49:40,130
-Anne?
- That's not yours. Tou didn't buy that.

657
00:49:40,207 --> 00:49:42,198
Tou snatched it
from some rich old lady.

658
00:49:42,276 --> 00:49:44,267
- There you are.
- So, what if l did?

659
00:49:44,345 --> 00:49:46,677
l've read every word
you have ever written.

660
00:49:46,747 --> 00:49:50,148
Oh, my. To whom?

661
00:49:50,217 --> 00:49:52,412
- Mary-Louise.
- To Mary-Louise.

662
00:49:53,487 --> 00:49:55,421
- Thank you so much.
- Tou're welcome.

663
00:49:55,489 --> 00:49:57,616
Do you use a computer?

664
00:49:57,691 --> 00:50:02,060
No, l feel a computer intrudes
between me and the naked experience.

665
00:50:03,097 --> 00:50:05,065
- There you are.
- Thank you.

666
00:50:05,132 --> 00:50:07,191
Tou're welcome.

667
00:50:07,268 --> 00:50:11,864
l think l've heard you make that remark
before in a different context.

668
00:50:11,939 --> 00:50:15,773
Ah. And you're still
giving Kelly bags.

669
00:50:16,977 --> 00:50:20,140
Do you still have yours?

670
00:50:20,214 --> 00:50:22,512
Oh, l lost it long ago.

671
00:50:22,583 --> 00:50:24,881
Tears ago.

672
00:50:27,888 --> 00:50:30,914
- To whom?
- To my mother, Monica.

673
00:50:32,359 --> 00:50:36,295
- Hey.
- Hi. Aren't you staying for Roxy's reading?

674
00:50:36,363 --> 00:50:38,854
No, l have to be
at the Luxembourg at 8:00.

675
00:50:40,468 --> 00:50:43,733
Is a purse of this kind really suitable
to carry around a bookshop?

676
00:50:43,804 --> 00:50:47,262
But it's so perfectly convenient.

677
00:50:47,341 --> 00:50:50,538
It's so beautiful,
why wouldn't l wanna wear it?

678
00:50:50,611 --> 00:50:53,546
- See you later.
- Okay. Bye.

679
00:50:57,518 --> 00:50:59,509
Fine. Thank you very much.

680
00:51:04,892 --> 00:51:07,360
- Do you live in Paris?
- Yes.

681
00:51:07,428 --> 00:51:11,228
l'm still committed,
but not to the point that l'd say...

682
00:51:14,168 --> 00:51:16,102
Something like that.

683
00:51:17,605 --> 00:51:20,096
-Are you staying for the reading?
- Oh, yes.

684
00:51:24,211 --> 00:51:26,611
Is this where the poetry reading is?

685
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:31,014
Yes, my sister's reading from a new
anthology of American women poets.

686
00:51:32,786 --> 00:51:35,118
Tou don't remember me.

687
00:51:35,189 --> 00:51:37,953
l'm Tellman. We met.

688
00:51:39,026 --> 00:51:41,620
Oh, you're Magda's husband.

689
00:51:48,235 --> 00:51:52,137
Thank you. Are you an admirer
of American poetry?

690
00:51:52,206 --> 00:51:54,197
No, l'm an entertainment lawyer.

691
00:51:57,177 --> 00:51:59,805
- Excuse me.
- Tou're a very beautiful woman.

692
00:52:00,881 --> 00:52:02,815
Are you married?

693
00:52:03,884 --> 00:52:06,216
- No.
- Are you in love?

694
00:52:10,224 --> 00:52:12,385
Have you ever had a puppy?

695
00:52:14,328 --> 00:52:16,660
- Yes.
- Did you love your puppy?

696
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:18,664
- Yeah.
- What would you do if someone...

697
00:52:18,732 --> 00:52:21,496
tried to take your puppy
away from you?

698
00:52:21,569 --> 00:52:26,268
Tou know, l have a lot of things
l have to take care of.

699
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:30,367
And thank you for your help.
It was great.

700
00:52:31,946 --> 00:52:34,346
What would you do?

701
00:52:34,415 --> 00:52:38,351
- Oh, my God.
- What was he saying to you? Who is he?

702
00:52:38,419 --> 00:52:42,913
He's somehow connected to Roxy
and Charles-Henri in a weird way.

703
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:45,458
He's weird.

704
00:52:45,526 --> 00:52:48,324
Tou are smiling too much.
Don't do that.

705
00:52:48,395 --> 00:52:50,727
Too much smiling
gets a girl in trouble.

706
00:52:54,168 --> 00:52:59,073
But most of all, let me thank Olivia Pace,
who is here tonight.

707
00:53:05,245 --> 00:53:09,341
Ladies and gentlemen, bienvenue,
welcome. Thank you for coming tonight.

708
00:53:09,416 --> 00:53:12,817
We are very, very lucky
to have as our reader...

709
00:53:12,886 --> 00:53:16,219
Roxeanne de Persand,
who, as you know...

710
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:19,316
is a very fine poet
in her own right.

711
00:53:19,393 --> 00:53:22,726
And of course it takes a poet
to dojustice to the work of other poets.

712
00:53:22,796 --> 00:53:27,062
Tou also probably know, and if you don't,
you can read it in my introduction...

713
00:53:27,134 --> 00:53:29,295
Buy the book!

714
00:53:29,369 --> 00:53:34,500
that for these last decades, our women
poets have really come into their own.

715
00:53:34,575 --> 00:53:37,669
But they have been always with us.

716
00:53:37,744 --> 00:53:42,681
Right from Anne Bradstreet
in the 1 7th century, whose
beautiful poem of marital love...

717
00:53:42,749 --> 00:53:44,808
is one of those that Roxeanne
is going to read today.

718
00:53:44,885 --> 00:53:47,285
l have a question.

719
00:53:47,354 --> 00:53:50,380
l think it's probably better to have
questions after the poetry reading.

720
00:53:50,457 --> 00:53:53,324
- Come on. Let's go outside.
- We are planning to do that.

721
00:53:53,393 --> 00:53:57,523
It's very important that
l speak to her. It's urgent!

722
00:53:58,732 --> 00:54:01,098
l have as much right
to be here as anyone else.

723
00:54:01,168 --> 00:54:03,830
- Come on.
- More of a right.

724
00:54:03,904 --> 00:54:06,498
This one's by Anne Bradstreet...

725
00:54:06,573 --> 00:54:08,564
and it's called...

726
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:12,938
"To My Dear and Loving Husband."

727
00:54:15,082 --> 00:54:19,746
"If ever two were one,
then surely we.

728
00:54:22,256 --> 00:54:26,716
"If ever man were loved by wife...

729
00:54:26,793 --> 00:54:28,727
"then thee.

730
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:32,763
"If ever wife was happy in a man...

731
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:35,358
"compare with me...

732
00:54:35,435 --> 00:54:39,098
"ye women if you can.

733
00:54:40,274 --> 00:54:42,208
"Thy love is such...

734
00:54:45,045 --> 00:54:47,570
"l can no way repay.

735
00:54:50,584 --> 00:54:52,882
"The heavens reward the manifold...

736
00:54:54,354 --> 00:54:56,982
- "l pray.

737
00:54:57,057 --> 00:55:02,859
"Then while we live,
in love let's so persevere.

738
00:55:06,733 --> 00:55:09,725
"That when we live no more...

739
00:55:10,804 --> 00:55:12,965
we may live ever."

740
00:55:19,213 --> 00:55:24,708
l have something to bring up
that is a little delicate.

741
00:55:24,785 --> 00:55:28,619
My son Antoine
has surprised us all...

742
00:55:28,689 --> 00:55:31,522
by suggesting that it
would be improper...

743
00:55:31,592 --> 00:55:36,427
to send the painting of Saint Ursula
to that Getty Museum in California.

744
00:55:36,496 --> 00:55:39,465
Not until the lawyers
have decided on its ownership.

745
00:55:41,235 --> 00:55:43,328
Its ownership?

746
00:55:43,403 --> 00:55:45,928
Saint Ursula belongs to our family.
We inherited her.

747
00:55:46,006 --> 00:55:48,941
My dear, we shouldn't
even be discussing this.

748
00:55:49,009 --> 00:55:52,035
It's entirely up to the lawyers.

749
00:55:53,947 --> 00:55:55,938
But it is a French painting
after all.

750
00:55:58,118 --> 00:56:03,454
Poor Charles. Oh, my son has
a league of troubles ofhis own.

751
00:56:03,523 --> 00:56:05,855
Roxeanne's lawyer
is very determined.

752
00:56:05,926 --> 00:56:09,953
And the husband of his petite amie
is very unpleasant.

753
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:13,124
Well, shall we say,
these are the wages of sin.

754
00:56:31,752 --> 00:56:35,313
She had a Hermès bag.
Red crocodile.

755
00:56:35,389 --> 00:56:38,756
- A Kelly bag?
- It's obvious where it came from.

756
00:56:38,825 --> 00:56:41,419
l know my brother.
Faithful only to Hermès.

757
00:56:41,495 --> 00:56:44,931
If ever he was faithful.
And l know his type.

758
00:56:44,998 --> 00:56:49,492
Permanent smile, little white suit,
fancy undergarments.

759
00:56:49,569 --> 00:56:53,096
- He adores that.
- Tour imagination is carrying you away.

760
00:56:53,173 --> 00:56:58,304
At his age!
Doesn't he get tired of this?

761
00:56:58,378 --> 00:57:01,279
Charlotte, honey,
call Amèlie, for once.

762
00:57:01,348 --> 00:57:04,875
No, Mother.
Call Aunt Amèlie yourself.

763
00:57:04,951 --> 00:57:09,217
- She'll think l'm angry.
- Mother? It's me.

764
00:57:09,289 --> 00:57:12,952
We'll both call her,
as representatives of the family.

765
00:57:13,026 --> 00:57:15,961
But we should call Edgar first,
shouldn't we?

766
00:57:16,029 --> 00:57:19,988
Remind him that a member
of our family has acted...

767
00:57:20,067 --> 00:57:23,798
- Badly.
- Towards a member of her family.

768
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:26,862
With this divorce on our hands...

769
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:30,398
- if he gets involved, we all suffer.
- l'll tell him.

770
00:57:44,224 --> 00:57:46,158
- Oui?
- Edgar?

771
00:57:46,226 --> 00:57:48,592
- Are you alone?
- Yes, l am. Why?

772
00:57:48,662 --> 00:57:51,290
- Is the American there?
- Tou mean Roxy?

773
00:57:51,365 --> 00:57:55,927
- Tou must mean the other American.
- Yes, Isabel.

774
00:57:56,002 --> 00:57:59,631
Mother said she's showing off
an expensive Hermès bag.

775
00:57:59,706 --> 00:58:05,303
Uh, a bag you gave her.
Tou know, with Charles-Henri's divorce...

776
00:58:05,379 --> 00:58:10,612
- What are you getting at?
- It's unseemly. That's what Mother says.

777
00:58:10,684 --> 00:58:13,175
Tell your mother to call me herself.

778
00:58:13,253 --> 00:58:16,916
If you prefer.

779
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:18,924
- Are you alone?
- Yes. Why?

780
00:58:18,992 --> 00:58:21,358
- Is the American with you?
- l said l'm alone.

781
00:58:21,428 --> 00:58:23,760
Good, then listen to me.

782
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:26,264
Seducing the daughter-in-law's
sister now.

783
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:28,699
Why not now?

784
00:58:28,769 --> 00:58:32,967
Tour nephew has acted
like a lout with her sister.

785
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:37,738
- How is that my fault?
- l'm thinking of the family.

786
00:58:37,811 --> 00:58:41,178
Custody, division of property,
alimony payments.

787
00:58:41,248 --> 00:58:44,217
Consider what you're doing.

788
00:58:44,284 --> 00:58:49,449
We'll see you on Sunday, l trust.
Good-bye.

789
00:58:49,523 --> 00:58:51,457
Voilà.

790
00:59:00,467 --> 00:59:02,731
Saint Ursula belonged
to our great-uncle...

791
00:59:02,803 --> 00:59:07,240
who left it to our father, and
your family has absolutely no say in it.

792
00:59:07,307 --> 00:59:10,140
Who is Saint Ursula?
The patron saint of schoolgirls.

793
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:12,974
The painting doesn't mean
a thing to your family...

794
00:59:13,046 --> 00:59:15,606
except to be split 50-50
in a divorce.

795
00:59:15,682 --> 00:59:18,549
We're not going to quarrel, you and I,
about Roxeanne's ugly saint.

796
00:59:25,759 --> 00:59:30,594
l've told you a purse of this kind
is not suitable for every occasion.

797
00:59:30,664 --> 00:59:33,292
l'd suggest a small,
black evening bag.

798
00:59:33,366 --> 00:59:36,767
Tou can talk about everything else.
My evening bag?

799
00:59:38,138 --> 00:59:41,767
Then go on TV,
talk about religion...

800
00:59:41,842 --> 00:59:44,538
- morality, sex.

801
00:59:45,779 --> 00:59:48,247
Why not about money?

802
00:59:56,256 --> 00:59:58,690
Is money an unmentionable subject
with you?

803
00:59:58,758 --> 01:00:01,420
Shh.

804
01:00:40,333 --> 01:00:42,995
No, it's not a La Tour.
It's obvious.

805
01:00:44,304 --> 01:00:47,432
"In the manner of'
at the very best.

806
01:00:47,507 --> 01:00:49,441
Of no interest to us.

807
01:00:49,509 --> 01:00:52,910
l may not be a specialist,
but it's not obvious to me.

808
01:00:52,979 --> 01:00:58,383
If the Getty Museum sees the resemblance
to La Tour, how can you be so sure?

809
01:00:58,451 --> 01:01:01,978
Why would we supplement
our collection of French paintings...

810
01:01:02,055 --> 01:01:07,425
with family heirlooms
from an American attic?

811
01:01:07,494 --> 01:01:12,158
It's of no interest
to the Louvre... at all.

812
01:01:14,434 --> 01:01:17,597
It's just so tacky.
Charles-Henri taking Roxy's painting.

813
01:01:17,671 --> 01:01:20,640
l would never try to take something
from him that he grew up with.

814
01:01:22,576 --> 01:01:25,443
Oh, sorry. l'm very sorry.

815
01:01:25,512 --> 01:01:27,446
- l didn't mean it.
- l'll get it.

816
01:01:30,083 --> 01:01:32,017
Why are you doing this now?

817
01:01:32,085 --> 01:01:34,280
Couldn't you have at least waited
till her baby's born?

818
01:01:34,354 --> 01:01:38,688
Well, there has to be a valuation
before there can be a division and sale.

819
01:01:38,758 --> 01:01:41,124
Tou'd think Charles-Henri
would wanna have his kids...

820
01:01:41,194 --> 01:01:44,891
have the furniture and the painting,
not some strangers buying them.

821
01:01:44,965 --> 01:01:47,160
He's just being a terrible shit.

822
01:01:47,233 --> 01:01:49,167
Or he's getting bad advice.

823
01:01:49,235 --> 01:01:51,635
Charles-Henri has left this up to me.

824
01:01:52,973 --> 01:01:55,134
Tou then are being a terrible shit.

825
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:07,713
And if it really were a La Tour?

826
01:02:07,787 --> 01:02:09,721
That would be a different matter.

827
01:02:09,789 --> 01:02:14,954
But you have a nice commode,
Louis XV-XVI.

828
01:02:15,028 --> 01:02:18,020
- How much is it worth?
- About 50,000.

829
01:02:18,098 --> 01:02:22,000
- More if it's stamped.
- Let's pull it out and check.
