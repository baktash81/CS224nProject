1
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,581
Eat up!

2
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,508
One day you'll never see me again.

3
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:39,678
That's right, Charlie.

4
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:44,307
The farm life may be it for you,
but it sure ain't for me.

5
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,437
I'm special.

6
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,023
Mama's gonna feel real stupid
when she finds out, won't she?

7
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:04,745
One day, the whole world's
gonna know my name.

8
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,705
You agree, don't you, Mary?

9
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,251
Oh. Why, thank you.

10
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,847
I do love a good audience.

11
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,022
Y'all see me for who I really am.

12
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,209
What are you doing in here, Mr. Goose?

13
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,299
Theda!

14
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,889
Go on, girl.

15
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,149
Take it.

16
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:29,055
You aren't to indulge
in any more such foolishness.

17
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,266
It's just dancing, Mama.

18
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,560
It's selfish is what it is.

19
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:37,272
With all the farmhands gone,
I can't do everything around here myself.

20
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,652
I help.

21
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,086
Anything for me in the post today?

22
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,296
No.

23
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,971
It says the Allies have
taken control of France.

24
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,890
You can read it after supper.

25
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,850
But, Mama, this could mean
the end of the war!

26
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,518
Do as I ask, Pearl.

27
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:19,230
I don't want to hear about
any more dead Germans tonight.

28
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,868
Supper's ready, Daddy.

29
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,669
<i>Bless us, O' Lord, and these thy gifts</i>

30
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,421
which we are about to receive
from thy bounty

31
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:46,800
through Christ our Lord. Amen.

32
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:47,968
Amen.

33
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,135
"My precious Pearl,

34
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,930
it feels as if it has been
an eternity without you.

35
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,016
All we do is walk, it seems.

36
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,394
I never know if we'll get
to where they say we're going.

37
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,855
They have us chew on bouillon cubes

38
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,857
so we don't notice the pains in our feet.

39
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,485
I find it most frightening
at night in the trenches.

40
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,029
<i>The mortar shells are deafening.</i>

41
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:52,157
<i>Many soldiers have gone mad with the fear.</i>

42
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,577
<i>Carnage from the gas has shown me things
I won't soon forget,</i>

43
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,829
<i>and thinking of you
has been my only reprieve.</i>

44
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,540
I will always be proud
to serve my country,

45
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,126
<i>but one thing this war has made clear</i>

46
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,336
<i>is that I cannot wait to return home</i>

47
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,796
and begin our life together.

48
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,507
I never want to be away from you again.

49
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,342
Till death do us part.

50
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:14,345
Your loving husband, Howard."

51
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,279
I'll go to town tomorrow.

52
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,033
Pick up more medicine.

53
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,249
Which means I get to stop by the pictures.

54
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:48,088
Just don't tell Mama.

55
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:51,091
They show all the best dancers
at the pictures.

56
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,307
I could be on the line
with those girls one day.

57
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,852
I know I could.

58
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,367
Pearl.

59
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:21,246
I didn't want to waste the hot water.

60
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:27,210
The money for his medicine
is on the kitchen table.

61
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,592
Remember to cover your face.

62
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,845
And don't linger close to anyone.

63
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:40,390
Papers are warning of a lethal resurgence.

64
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,476
God forbid sickness returns to our home.

65
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,339
The time is now...

66
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,097
Two-bits, please.

67
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:17,862
<i>Poor Johnny's heart</i>

68
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,030
<i>Went pitty, pitty pat</i>

69
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,366
<i>Somewhere in sunny France</i>

70
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,576
<i>He met a girl by chance</i>

71
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,954
<i>With ze naughty, naughty glance</i>

72
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:28,248
<i>She looked just like a kitty, kitty cat</i>

73
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,500
<i>She loved to dance and play</i>

74
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,002
<i>Tho' he learned no French
When he left the trench</i>

75
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,421
<i>He knew well enough to say</i>

76
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:40,343
<i>Oui, oui, Marie</i>

77
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,428
<i>Will you do zis for me?</i>

78
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,514
<i>Oui, oui, Marie...</i>

79
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,406
Did you enjoy the picture?

80
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,496
Cigarette?

81
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,375
Oh, go on. I don't have the bug.

82
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,008
You like the movies?

83
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,509
I like dancing.

84
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,761
Oh, a future Tiller Girl.

85
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,096
I can see it now.

86
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,098
I wish.

87
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,558
Why not? You're pretty enough.

88
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,440
On account of a husband, I gather?

89
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,818
He's overseas,

90
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,654
but my father's infirmed,
so I have to help at home.

91
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:42,822
I'm sorry to hear that.

92
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,242
You want to come watch the second show?

93
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,911
Free admission.

94
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,124
I'm the projectionist.

95
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,588
I need to get going.

96
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,091
Mama's expecting me,
but I appreciate the...

97
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,926
Stay there for just one minute, would you?

98
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:06,971
Okay.

99
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,785
From what you just saw.

100
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,495
Aren't you showing it again?

101
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,080
Ah, sure, but it's only one frame.

102
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,891
Nobody will notice
once I splice it back together.

103
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,626
You know, caring for your family
during these times is admirable.

104
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,546
You ought to take pride in that,
but don't forget to live your life, too.

105
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,633
I wouldn't mind seeing you
up on that screen one day, Missus...

106
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,135
Pearl.

107
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,808
Well, if you come back,
knock on this door.

108
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,436
I'm always here, and, well, I can
run the pictures as much as I like.

109
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,314
Thank you. I will.

110
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,173
May I have this dance?

111
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,136
I'm married!

112
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,683
What took you so long?

113
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,601
It's a far ride, Mama.

114
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,313
What is on your head?

115
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,817
Found it along the road.

116
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:39,822
Do not bring it inside.
It may be covered in germs.

117
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:46,829
Wash your hair.
If you're lucky, it's only full of lice.

118
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,250
When you finish,
your father needs changing.

119
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,753
Don't let him sit in his mess.

120
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,802
I saw a new picture today.

121
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:05,055
You'd have liked it.
The girls were all flawless.

122
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:10,186
There's no room for even the tiniest
lack of precision in a troupe like that.

123
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,521
It takes absolute perfection.

124
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:16,400
What a charmed life it must be
to star in the movies.

125
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,247
Are you still in there?

126
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,992
Bless us, O' Lord, and these thy gifts

127
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:51,078
which we are about to receive
from thy bounty

128
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:54,206
through Christ our Lord. Amen.

129
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,374
Amen.

130
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:11,390
Where is the rest of the money I lent you?

131
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:16,312
- There was none.
- I can count, Pearl.

132
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:20,024
There are eight cents missing.

133
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,902
I may have gotten some hard candy
for the trip home.

134
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:32,119
That is enough, then.
You ate the candy, that was your supper.

135
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:36,206
The food I worked hard
to prepare alone is not.

136
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:40,252
But, Mama, I rode all that way.
I'm starving.

137
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,504
You may have what's left of it
in the morning.

138
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,261
- Where are you going?
- To bed!

139
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:52,139
I did not excuse you from the table.

140
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:33,514
I know that. And I am careful.

141
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,076
Good.

142
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,263
Please, Lord,

143
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:18,142
make me the biggest star
the world has ever known,

144
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:21,854
so that I may get far, far away
from this place.

145
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,151
Amen.

146
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:39,973
Afternoon, Pearl!

147
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:43,477
Hi, Mitsy! I like your dress.

148
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,687
Oh, thank you.

149
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:49,608
It feels wonderful to finally be able
to don something pretty again.

150
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,652
It's the first time
we've left home in weeks.

151
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,904
Mother is so afraid of getting ill.

152
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,280
Mama, too.

153
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:58,867
Well, we were a bit worried about
the both of you being out here all alone,

154
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,953
so we brought some food.

155
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,956
- That's very kind.
- How have you been getting on?

156
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,917
Any new letters from Howard?

157
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,544
Oh, well,

158
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,255
Mother has been riddled with worry.

159
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:14,007
They say no news is good news, though.

160
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:17,845
If only his pride hadn't gotten him
involved in this dreadful war.

161
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:21,014
You know we had a doctor
willing to declare him ineligible?

162
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,725
Anyone would've taken that opportunity.
Not Howard!

163
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,812
First, he runs off to become a farmer.

164
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,397
Now, the army.

165
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,276
The lengths my brother will go
to just to spite his father.

166
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,069
All this isolation has been enough

167
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,339
to make one mad, hasn't it?

168
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,365
It really has.

169
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,659
No, we don't accept charity.

170
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,078
Oh, for God's sake, Ruth. It's just a pig.

171
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:50,419
Can I share a secret with you, Pearl?

172
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:57,342
Mother would throttle me if she knew
I was planning on attending.

173
00:27:57,426 --> 00:28:02,306
But there's a dance audition this Saturday
at our church for a Christmas chorus line

174
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:05,475
to bring merriment to folks
throughout the state during the holidays.

175
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:08,437
Word is, they're putting together a troupe

176
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,815
and will be touring seven different cities
before the year ends.

177
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:13,692
Don't that sound exciting?

178
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:17,446
- I would love so much to be a part of it.
- So would I.

179
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,448
We should go together then.

180
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,201
But you can't tell a soul.

181
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:23,535
I would never.

182
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,871
Splendid. It'll be our secret.

183
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,164
Mitsy!

184
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:32,085
I better skedaddle. We got three more pigs
to drop off this afternoon.

185
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:37,257
- Saturday at 11:00.
- Okay.

186
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:39,426
Sister-in-laws have
to stick together, right?

187
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,678
Mitsy!

188
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:44,223
- Time to go!
- See you later, Pearl.

189
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:47,434
Bye, Mitsy!

190
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,983
Charlie, this could be it.

191
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,143
Pearl?

192
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,029
Pearl!

193
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,004
Well,

194
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,090
I didn't expect
to see you again this soon.

195
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,278
Have a seat.

196
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,500
I can't believe you get to see
the pictures every day for free.

197
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:42,419
Yeah, not a bad gig, huh?

198
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,342
Thank you.

199
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:52,804
So, to what do I owe this pleasure?

200
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,809
I've been thinking a lot about
what you said to me the other day,

201
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:01,980
about not forgetting
to live my life, and, well,

202
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,900
there's a dance audition
coming up at the church.

203
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,152
Oh, I like the sound of that.

204
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,612
So do I.

205
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:12,365
But I've never really danced
in front of anyone before.

206
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,203
What if I'm not perfect?

207
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:18,705
You can do anything
if you want it bad enough.

208
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,833
I want it.

209
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:24,544
Then don't let anything stand in your way.

210
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,006
What would you like to see?

211
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,634
<i>Palace Follies.</i>

212
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:33,094
Oh, come on. You saw that already.

213
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,847
How about something different tonight?
How about...

214
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:42,646
How about a film nobody else has seen?

215
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:43,897
Okay.

216
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:49,528
I picked this one up
while I was in the service in France.

217
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,284
Do you live in here?

218
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,581
I lay my head on that pillow
from time to time,

219
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:04,376
but I wouldn't say
I live anywhere in particular.

220
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,879
I'm what more civilized people
refer to as bohemian.

221
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:10,966
I don't know what that is.

222
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,052
It means I can pack up and leave
whenever I want to.

223
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,805
Sounds like a dream.

224
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,641
Just as long as I can keep from waking up.

225
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,503
- What is this?
- Just watch.

226
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,788
Never seen anything like that
before now, have you?

227
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,752
There are all kinds of underground
stag films like this out there.

228
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:34,341
- Is it legal?
- Doing it, yeah.

229
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:37,052
Filming it, no.

230
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:41,473
Not here, anyway. It will be eventually.

231
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,975
People would pay an arm and a leg
to see this.

232
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:47,646
Pictures like this are going
to revolutionize the industry

233
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:51,191
and I, for one, plan
on capitalizing early.

234
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,319
It's reality.

235
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,364
There's no denying
we all share a fascination

236
00:35:57,447 --> 00:36:00,283
in seeing people as they truly are.

237
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,703
I don't like reality.

238
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,250
Where I live, I mean.

239
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,585
So, leave.

240
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,220
It's not that easy.

241
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,365
Well, sure it is.
There's a road right out front there

242
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,391
that'll take you
all the way to New York City.

243
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,812
One day my mother and father will be gone.

244
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:34,025
- I can do what I want then.
- What if that's too late?

245
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:40,448
The fact of the matter is, Pearl,
you only get one take at this life.

246
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,118
And if you don't make the most of it
when you're young,

247
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,036
you don't get a second chance.

248
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:50,709
If only they would just die...

249
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:55,672
Pardon?

250
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:00,343
Nothing.

251
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:08,101
It's real nice to be able to talk
to someone for a change.

252
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,520
Been cooped up on that farm for so long,

253
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:15,191
sometimes I worry that maybe
I'm not the same as other people.

254
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:19,320
Why would you ever want to be
like everybody else?

255
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,866
I don't know.

256
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:28,788
Sometimes it just seems
more peaceful, I guess.

257
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,967
Did you mean what you said?

258
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,636
About wanting to see me up on that screen?

259
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:46,097
Sure, I did.

260
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,100
I'd do anything to be up there.

261
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,855
Well, then you ought to go overseas
when this pandemic ends.

262
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,398
That's what I'm doing.

263
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:57,859
The arts are so much more alive in Europe.

264
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,986
You can be whoever you want to be there.

265
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,322
Really?

266
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,199
You could even be in pictures like this.

267
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,993
I know I'd watch you.

268
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,667
I should go now.

269
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,381
Thank you.

270
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:21,674
What for?

271
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:24,177
For seeing me tonight.

272
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:50,555
What are you staring at?

273
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:34,891
Theda!

274
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,611
I'm leaving soon.

275
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:54,202
I can't stay here any longer.

276
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:58,373
Howard was supposed to take me away.

277
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:04,379
It'd be easier for me if I didn't feel
like I was abandoning you.

278
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:08,383
You understand that?

279
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:17,016
I love you, Daddy,
but this is no way to live.

280
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:22,063
Pearl?

281
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,025
What are you doing?

282
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,112
Talking with Daddy.

283
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:34,909
We need to get him back to the house.

284
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:39,706
Why do you hate me, Mama?

285
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:45,086
I only want what's best.

286
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,298
When do I get what I want?

287
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:57,056
One day you'll understand that getting
what you want isn't what's important.

288
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,769
Making the most of what you have is.

289
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,898
Life rarely turns out how you expect.

290
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:08,818
You need to be prepared for that
if you ever want to be happy.

291
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,321
Come back inside.

292
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:31,841
Where are you?

293
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:48,417
Stop staring at me.

294
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:51,856
How'd you find that?

295
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,192
I am not blind
to what goes on around here.

296
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,570
Take your dinner. Stay in the bunkhouse.

297
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,155
But it's freezing out there!

298
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:01,866
You should've thought of that
before putting me at risk.

299
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,368
Isolate yourself
until we know you're not ill.

300
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:06,412
That is what's right.

301
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:13,127
There's a dance audition in town tomorrow.

302
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:19,508
- I'm going to it.
- No, you're not.

303
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:22,428
- Yes, I am.
- Why?

304
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,556
Find out if I'm good enough.

305
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,100
Good enough for what, Pearl?

306
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:35,107
Something more than this.

307
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,780
Where does all this ungratefulness
stem from?

308
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,992
How is it you find our life
so beneath you?

309
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:49,163
You've always had a roof over your head,
food in your belly.

310
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:53,334
Do you not think that came
at great sacrifice from your father and I?

311
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:56,128
Or do you think we are beneath you, too?

312
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:57,421
If I'm meant to live out

313
00:45:57,505 --> 00:45:59,966
the rest of my days with you
and Daddy on this farm,

314
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:03,552
then so be it, but I'm only young once.

315
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:06,722
If I go to this audition
and I don't get picked,

316
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:10,726
then I'll come home
and I'll never speak of it again, I swear.

317
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:14,855
But I have to know that I tried
or I'm gonna regret it my whole life.

318
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:17,692
Please, Mama!
You have no idea what I'm capable of!

319
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:20,945
Oh, yes, I do.

320
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:26,575
I've seen the things
you've done in private,

321
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:28,202
when you believe no one is watching.

322
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:32,331
You think others won't notice?

323
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:35,042
You can't keep your true self
hidden forever, Pearl.

324
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:37,837
They will notice eventually,

325
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,549
and they will be frightened, just as I am.

326
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:46,470
- You're wrong.
- Am I?

327
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:50,474
Then what a fine woman you hope to become,

328
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:52,101
leaving your mother alone to rot

329
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:55,187
so you can dance
with a bunch of city whores.

330
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:58,024
Let alone the illness
you may contract and spread.

331
00:46:58,107 --> 00:46:59,942
You've seen what it does to your father.

332
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:01,986
That's what you want
for yourself and others?

333
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,655
And maybe that is what you wish for me.

334
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:07,241
- Of course not.
- Stop lying!

335
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:09,368
I can't stand the sound of it anymore!

336
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:12,913
It's almost as abhorrent
as your sinful behavior!

337
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:16,208
You are not well, Pearl!

338
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:18,794
It's only a matter of time
before you hurt someone else.

339
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:23,174
Malevolence is festering in you, I see it.

340
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:27,428
And I will not, in good conscience,
let you leave this farm again.

341
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:31,807
- You can't stop me.
- Oh, yes, I can.

342
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:34,352
You don't want to know
what I could do to you.

343
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:38,731
I shoulder a burden
you will never understand,

344
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:42,818
spend my days feeding and wiping the snot
off the face of the man I married.

345
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:46,238
You dare sit there
and talk to me about regret?

346
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:49,367
I was supposed to be his wife,
not his mother!

347
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:53,454
Don't you ever speak that way to me again!
Do you hear me?

348
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:56,457
- I'm sorry.
- No! You're not!

349
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,292
Or you would stop all this!

350
00:47:58,376 --> 00:47:59,835
Here! Take it!

351
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:02,963
That's what you really desire, isn't it?

352
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:05,674
Perhaps I should kill him for you?

353
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:08,052
That way you don't have
to care for him any longer.

354
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,513
Would that suit
your selfish dreams better?

355
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:13,265
Then we can both go to the dance audition!

356
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:15,768
Your husband is gone. So is mine.

357
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:19,063
Why should we be saddled with caring
for them or the work of this farm?

358
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,982
What about us getting what we want?

359
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,867
I won't suffer for you any longer.

360
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:34,578
You want to leave? Go.

361
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,997
But when you fail,

362
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:40,543
and you will fail,

363
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:44,964
I want you to remember what it feels like

364
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:49,593
because that's how I feel
every time I look at you.

365
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:54,098
Nearly everything I ever had
has been taken from me, Pearl.

366
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:57,852
What more do you want?

367
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:01,814
I just don't want
to end up like you, is all.

368
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:16,704
I hate you!

369
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,665
You harlot!

370
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:22,460
I won't let you flaunt
your arrogance in my face!

371
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:25,588
- You are not better than me!
- Yes, I am!

372
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,798
I'm going to be a star!

373
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:30,509
The whole world is going to know my name!

374
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:10,085
Where are you going?
It's not even 6:00 a.m. yet.

375
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:11,879
I have to practice my routine.

376
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,798
I need to be perfect
for my audition today.

377
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:19,553
You still think I'm pretty enough?

378
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:21,972
Oh, not much has changed
in the last 24 hours.

379
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:23,474
Yes, it has.

380
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:26,560
Oh. You forgot this last time.

381
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:29,688
I'm glad you came back.

382
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:34,193
So am I.

383
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:41,784
Let me at least drive you home.

384
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:56,507
Somebody you know?

385
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:02,054
I'm not really sure.

386
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,138
Well,

387
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:07,893
it's hard to know who anyone is nowadays
with all these masks people are wearing.

388
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:40,092
Wait here a minute.

389
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:04,867
Daddy, I'm so sorry.

390
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:29,600
I'm going to get you cleaned up, okay?
I just have a guest right now.

391
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:01,340
Okay, come in!

392
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:20,984
This is my father.

393
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,573
Pleased to meet you, sir.

394
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:36,500
Want to go up to my bedroom now?

395
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,551
I want off this farm forever.

396
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:49,054
I don't know. It doesn't seem so bad.

397
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:51,890
It is.

398
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:56,186
What was that?

399
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:57,479
Nothing.

400
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:00,941
Tell me more about Europe.

401
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:03,193
When can we go?

402
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:09,032
- Don't you think you should go check?
- No.

403
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:15,372
All right, I'm sorry.
Whatever that is, we can't just ignore it.

404
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,976
It could be your father,
for Christ's sake.

405
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,460
It's not my father.

406
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:22,629
Please don't go.

407
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:25,424
What's the matter with you?

408
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:28,510
Nothing.

409
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,104
It's our dog.

410
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:24,388
She made a mess while I was away,
so I put her in the root cellar.

411
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:28,487
I want to show you something.

412
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:36,870
That's Charlie!

413
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:40,123
She's always hungry.

414
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:42,542
We can't afford to feed her
like we used to.

415
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:45,629
And over here, this is Mary.

416
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:47,172
Ain't she a dish?

417
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:51,301
This is Francis.

418
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,262
They're my best audience.

419
00:57:54,346 --> 00:57:58,141
I named each of them
after my favorite picture stars.

420
00:57:58,225 --> 00:58:01,645
I've put on so many shows
for them over the years.

421
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,730
It'll be sad to say goodbye,
but like they say,

422
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:07,401
"If you're not moving forward in business,
you're moving backwards."

423
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:11,697
We used to have many more animals,
but they all died.

424
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:14,366
What about your dog?

425
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:18,829
- What's its name?
- We don't have a dog.

426
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:23,917
I thought you said you did? In the cellar?

427
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:31,133
Right. Yeah.

428
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:35,262
Yeah, well...

429
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:39,391
Oh, boy.

430
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:42,477
Oh, I better be getting back, you know?

431
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,523
- What?
- I've got to go and screen the matinee,

432
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,608
you know,
but you gotta practice, remember?

433
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:50,292
You gotta get those dance moves perfect.

434
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:54,156
Now's not the time to be
resting on your laurels, is it?

435
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:57,993
Nice seeing you, Pearl.

436
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:03,331
Did I do something wrong?

437
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,589
Then why did you just go cold on me?

438
00:59:13,008 --> 00:59:14,259
I don't know what you mean.

439
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,887
What did you see?

440
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:19,514
I didn't see anything.

441
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,226
You're lying.

442
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:26,021
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

443
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:30,859
I know because I feel things very deeply.

444
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,695
Look, I've got to get back
to work, all right?

445
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:35,238
- I'll see you later.
- When?

446
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:37,240
- What?
- When will I see you?

447
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:39,084
I don't know, Pearl.
It's just an expression.

448
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:41,717
You're not going to take me to Europe.
Tell me the truth.

449
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:44,831
What did I do wrong?

450
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:46,500
- Nothing. Calm down.
- No!

451
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,086
Why are you leaving me
if I didn't do anything wrong?

452
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:51,171
I don't understand!
I thought you liked me!

453
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:54,341
- I do like you, I just...
- Tell me the truth!

454
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,927
Why are you leaving me?
What did you see? Why did you change?

455
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,887
You're scaring me, Pearl.

456
00:59:59,888 --> 01:00:01,139
Okay?

457
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:05,769
I wish you the best of luck
with your audition.

458
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,104
Sincerely.

459
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:32,003
You're not gonna leave me here!

460
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:34,756
I'm not staying on this farm!

461
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:40,428
Nothing's going to keep me here!

462
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:52,524
You hear me?

463
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,609
Nothing!

464
01:00:58,113 --> 01:01:00,490
Not you! Not Howard!

465
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:03,285
Not Nama! Nobody!

466
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:14,588
No. No.

467
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:36,193
I want you to remember what it feels like.

468
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:41,531
'Cause that's how I felt
every time you looked at me.

469
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:50,749
Okay, Daddy. Let's get you cleaned up.

470
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:24,199
I wish you wouldn't look at me like that.

471
01:02:58,233 --> 01:02:59,734
What do you think?

472
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:31,933
Thank you for everything.

473
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:36,479
I know you'll look down on me proudly.

474
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:45,780
You are loved.

475
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:09,012
<i>Au revoir,</i> poor Johnny!

476
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:53,264
Oh, thank goodness you came.

477
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:55,242
I was beginning to think
you weren't going to show.

478
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:59,104
Sorry. I had some chores to do
around the house.

479
01:04:59,187 --> 01:05:01,773
Well, I've been in such a flap
all by myself.

480
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:05,693
I feel worse than I imagine I would
had I contracted that awful flu.

481
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:08,780
What's in the suitcases?

482
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:11,366
All my things I need
for going on the road.

483
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:13,660
Wow. You're confident.

484
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:19,249
Rumor has it they may only be
taking one gal per town.

485
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:23,378
It has to be me.

486
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:29,092
I don't think you meant
to say that out loud, Pearl.

487
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:32,762
Well, if it's not me,
then I hope it's you, right?

488
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:34,264
It has to be me.

489
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:40,562
Next.

490
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:55,368
That's Dorothy Collins.

491
01:05:58,163 --> 01:06:00,415
Can't say I'm too saddened for her.

492
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:03,918
Some people just think
they're God's gift, you know?

493
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:06,629
But they always get
what's coming to them eventually.

494
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:13,303
I feel bad saying that, actually.
She's a nurse.

495
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,389
I don't know how to do
something like that.

496
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:19,058
Oh, Pearl. I'm so nervous.

497
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:22,854
What if they laugh me right off stage?
I don't think I could handle that.

498
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:26,649
How are you not scared?

499
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:31,779
I guess I'm just more used to the feeling.

500
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:38,536
Next.

501
01:06:54,636 --> 01:06:56,262
Oh, Lord.

502
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:06,940
Switch places with me.

503
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:09,108
I don't think I can do this.
I'm too frightened.

504
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:11,027
- What?
- Come on, Pearl.

505
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:13,655
Switch, before they open the doors again.

506
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:16,866
Come on. Move.

507
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:24,332
Thank you.

508
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:25,833
You're a good friend.

509
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:32,340
Am I?

510
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:36,177
Of course you are.

511
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:45,270
Sister-in-laws have
to stick together, right?

512
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:14,173
Next.

513
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:19,512
Your turn, Pearl.
Time to show them what you can do.

514
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:21,097
I'm gonna show them all.

515
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:23,433
Break a leg.

516
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:27,997
Ready, miss?

517
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:27,450
Thank you.

518
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:31,496
But it's gonna be a no.

519
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:47,929
Pardon?

520
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:51,808
Sorry, you're just not
what we had in mind.

521
01:12:01,108 --> 01:12:03,319
Well, that was the best dancing
I've ever done.

522
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:07,990
Yes, it was very nice.

523
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:11,619
But we already have plenty
of gals like you in the troupe.

524
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:14,580
We're looking for something
different today.

525
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:20,586
You know? More all-American,
younger and blonde.

526
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:24,465
Someone with X factor.

527
01:12:27,969 --> 01:12:29,178
What?

528
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,057
Next!

529
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:41,023
Come on.

530
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:43,317
Come on.

531
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:45,278
I'm afraid so.

532
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:48,614
Come on, miss. Time to go.

533
01:12:53,661 --> 01:12:55,788
Please.

534
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:57,957
You don't understand. I need this.

535
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,376
Next in line, please.

536
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:02,980
I can make it better.

537
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:07,008
Come on now, darling. You don't want
to make a scene and spoil everything.

538
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:09,927
Please! Just give me one more chance.

539
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:13,848
- Come on, now.
- No.

540
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:15,558
I'm a star.

541
01:13:16,684 --> 01:13:19,437
Come on. Come on, miss. I'm sorry.

542
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,772
- It's time to go.
- No, I'm a star!

543
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:22,857
Come on.

544
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:27,236
Please! I'm a star!

545
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:31,115
I'm sorry. It's time to go.

546
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:33,409
Please, somebody help me!

547
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:37,330
Please! Help me! Help me!

548
01:14:18,245 --> 01:14:19,330
Pearl?

549
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:23,000
Pearl?

550
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:29,799
How about I take you home?

551
01:14:59,286 --> 01:15:01,288
Is that our pig?

552
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:21,058
Should I go and fetch your mother?

553
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:32,987
How about I get you
something nice to drink?

554
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:37,867
Mama was right.

555
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:41,620
I'm never getting off this farm.

556
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:44,081
And where would you want to go?

557
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:47,209
- Europe.
- Europe?

558
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:48,544
What on earth for?

559
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:53,215
It'll be in ruins and you'll never get
Howard back there, I'll tell you.

560
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:56,844
Oh, come on, now.

561
01:15:56,927 --> 01:16:00,723
I know you're disappointed,
but there's no sense taking it this hard.

562
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:03,100
It's just a lousy old church group.

563
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:05,519
Those old dolts,

564
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:09,607
they don't know the first thing
about quality dancing.

565
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:12,818
You don't understand.

566
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:14,570
What don't I?

567
01:16:14,653 --> 01:16:15,946
Come on, Pearl.

568
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:18,365
What's really the matter?

569
01:16:21,452 --> 01:16:23,037
I don't feel well.

570
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:30,382
You're not coming down
with something, are you?

571
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:33,172
No. It's nothing like that.

572
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:34,673
Oh, thank goodness.

573
01:16:34,757 --> 01:16:38,969
If I snuck out of the house and ended up
bringing home nothing but the germ,

574
01:16:39,053 --> 01:16:41,889
my mother and father would just kill me.

575
01:16:43,891 --> 01:16:47,728
I'm worried there may be something
real wrong with me, Mitsy.

576
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:52,149
How do you mean?

577
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:56,654
Seems like there's something missing in me
that the rest of the world has.

578
01:16:58,364 --> 01:17:00,157
Have you told Howard?

579
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:04,537
I've never spoken about it
out loud to anyone.

580
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:08,374
So afraid of what people might think.

581
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:09,834
Pearl,

582
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:13,087
Howard's your husband.

583
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:16,132
He adores you.

584
01:17:16,215 --> 01:17:18,926
You shouldn't be afraid
to tell him how you feel.

585
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:21,637
I'm scared of what I might say.

586
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:25,266
Well, practice on me first, then.

587
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:29,270
Pretend I'm Howard,
and you just say whatever's on your mind.

588
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:32,106
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

589
01:17:33,107 --> 01:17:34,900
Go on. Get it all out.

590
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:38,362
- Really?
- Yes.

591
01:17:38,445 --> 01:17:40,072
Trust me.

592
01:17:52,626 --> 01:17:53,961
Howard...

593
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:01,760
Go ahead, Pearl.

594
01:18:08,309 --> 01:18:12,521
I hate you so much for leaving me here,
sometimes I hope you die.

595
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:17,276
I'm sorry.

596
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:21,447
I feel awful admitting that,
but it's the truth.

597
01:18:24,491 --> 01:18:26,076
I was curious

598
01:18:27,077 --> 01:18:28,913
about other men.

599
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:33,459
I'm sure you don't want to hear
about a stranger satisfying your wife,

600
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:36,962
and I swear it was only once.
It was a mistake.

601
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:40,883
It wasn't him that I wanted.
I know that now.

602
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:44,136
And I wish things could just go back
to the way they were before,

603
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:45,846
but I don't see how they could,

604
01:18:47,932 --> 01:18:49,934
not after the things I've done.

605
01:18:53,646 --> 01:18:58,108
- What else have you done, Pearl?
- Oh, Howard.

606
01:18:58,192 --> 01:19:00,611
I realize how this all must sound.

607
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:03,989
Honestly, there was a time I was flattered

608
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:06,659
to have someone as handsome as you
pine over me.

609
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:09,370
You're such a good person. I know that.

610
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:13,499
I made sure to always be mindful
with your heart.

611
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:16,210
I never wanted you to feel jealous.

612
01:19:17,378 --> 01:19:18,671
It's an awful feeling,

613
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:23,425
like a rot, the way it just twists
and turns at your insides.

614
01:19:23,509 --> 01:19:25,636
I know that aching so well.

615
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:27,429
I feel it

616
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:30,975
whenever I see others
whose lives come easy,

617
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:36,063
because the truth is,
I'm not really a good person.

618
01:19:37,564 --> 01:19:38,857
Pearl, I think I should just...

619
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:41,402
The reason I kept my eyes
to the ground around other men

620
01:19:41,485 --> 01:19:43,487
was never to avoid hurting you.

621
01:19:45,322 --> 01:19:48,909
It's because I understood
how lucky I was to have your attention.

622
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:53,455
I may be a poor farm girl, Howard,
but I'm not stupid.

623
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:57,084
I spotted you the moment
you came to live with us.

624
01:19:57,167 --> 01:20:00,921
You worked hard like the other farmhands,
but you were different.

625
01:20:01,005 --> 01:20:03,048
You're from somewhere.

626
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:07,136
A nice, comfortable place that you could
return to whenever you wanted.

627
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:11,849
I'm so desperate to have that.

628
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:17,771
All my life, I've wanted off this farm
and you were my ticket out.

629
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:24,278
So I made sure to never let you see
who I really was.

630
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:26,697
It worked like a charm, too.

631
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:31,035
Then, when you finally brought me back
to your home to meet your family,

632
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:32,745
it was just as I hoped.

633
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:36,749
A life straight out of the pictures.

634
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:40,461
At least that's what it felt like to me.

635
01:20:42,963 --> 01:20:44,590
And you didn't want it.

636
01:20:47,593 --> 01:20:51,180
You just wanted to stay here on our farm,
and that made me so angry.

637
01:20:52,306 --> 01:20:56,727
How could you? I'm certain
you knew I hated it, you must've.

638
01:20:56,810 --> 01:21:00,939
How could you be so selfish and cruel
after all I've done to make you happy?

639
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:08,989
I was even pregnant with your baby.

640
01:21:13,827 --> 01:21:16,246
I never wanted to be a mother.

641
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:20,834
I loathed the feeling of it
growing inside me.

642
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:22,920
It felt like sickness.

643
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:28,550
Pulling and sucking on me
like some needy animal in a barn.

644
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:33,514
How could I be responsible
for another life?

645
01:21:33,597 --> 01:21:35,432
Life terrifies me.

646
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:38,227
It's harsh, and bleak, and draining.

647
01:21:40,646 --> 01:21:42,940
I was so relieved when it died.

648
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:44,900
It was one less weight
keeping me trapped here,

649
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:48,445
but then the war came
and you left me, too.

650
01:21:48,529 --> 01:21:50,948
Why did you leave me, Howard?

651
01:21:57,162 --> 01:22:00,916
I hate feeling like this. So pathetic.

652
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:05,003
Do people like you ever feel this way?

653
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:08,424
I figure you don't.
You seem so perfect all the time.

654
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:11,009
Lord must've been generous to you.

655
01:22:11,093 --> 01:22:13,554
He never answers any of my prayers.

656
01:22:13,637 --> 01:22:18,100
I don't know why, what did I do?
What is wrong with me?

657
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:20,394
Please, just tell me
so maybe I can get better.

658
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:21,895
I don't want to end up like Mama.

659
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:25,858
I want to be dancing up on the screen
like the pretty gals in the pictures.

660
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:29,862
I want what they have so badly,

661
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:31,572
to be perfect,

662
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:34,199
to be loved from as many people
as possible,

663
01:22:34,283 --> 01:22:37,119
to make up for all my time
spent suffering.

664
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:43,250
I wake in the middle of the night
and the fear washes over me,

665
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:44,835
'cause what if this is it?

666
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:48,964
What if this is right where I belong?

667
01:22:54,428 --> 01:22:55,846
I'm a failure.

668
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:58,140
I'm not pretty

669
01:22:59,725 --> 01:23:02,686
or naturally pleasant, or friendly.

670
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:06,607
I'm not smart, or funny, or confident.

671
01:23:08,942 --> 01:23:11,570
I'm exactly what Mama said I was, weak.

672
01:23:12,863 --> 01:23:16,909
I don't know why. What did I do?
Why wasn't my family like yours?

673
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:19,995
I hate what it feels like to be me
and not you.

674
01:23:20,078 --> 01:23:21,955
I'm so scared
that when you finally come home,

675
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:25,042
you'll see me and be frightened
like everyone else is.

676
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:30,422
I know what I've done,

677
01:23:30,506 --> 01:23:32,716
the bad things,

678
01:23:32,799 --> 01:23:35,844
terrible, awful, murderous things.

679
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:39,598
I regret them now,
but I liked how they felt.

680
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:41,683
I wish I didn't, but I did.

681
01:23:43,227 --> 01:23:46,230
At first, it was only animals
smaller than myself.

682
01:23:47,314 --> 01:23:49,733
Nothing with feelings,
nothing that could hurt me back.

683
01:23:51,235 --> 01:23:53,362
It felt good.

684
01:23:53,445 --> 01:23:56,615
Killing's easier than you think,

685
01:23:56,698 --> 01:23:59,493
till recently with Mama
and the boy from the picture house.

686
01:23:59,576 --> 01:24:03,163
They were different.
They were more meaningful.

687
01:24:03,247 --> 01:24:06,166
I hurt them, so they, too, might know
what it feels like to suffer,

688
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:09,878
but poor Daddy didn't deserve that.
I wish I hadn't done what I did.

689
01:24:12,756 --> 01:24:14,174
Mama meant well.

690
01:24:15,342 --> 01:24:17,636
She had a hard life.

691
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:20,472
She only wanted a home to feel safe in,
I can see that.

692
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:24,309
I thought I hated her,
but I just want to feel safe, too.

693
01:24:31,692 --> 01:24:34,778
I made such a mess of things.

694
01:24:35,779 --> 01:24:37,781
I don't know how much more I can take.

695
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:41,201
I need to clean this up.

696
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:43,495
All of it.

697
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:47,207
I need to make things right
before you see me again.

698
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:52,588
Maybe if I can turn this farm
into a home for us like you wanted,

699
01:24:52,671 --> 01:24:54,423
things will finally be different.

700
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:57,968
I can forgive.

701
01:24:58,051 --> 01:25:02,264
I can be who you want me to be
if you'll just stay with me.

702
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:05,809
Would you do that, please?

703
01:25:08,312 --> 01:25:11,148
I can't be all by myself anymore.
It's too hard.

704
01:25:15,986 --> 01:25:17,738
We can love each other.

705
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:19,698
I'll do that for you

706
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:22,993
if you really meant all that
"till death do us part."

707
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:26,496
It'd be enough,

708
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:31,209
just you and me here on this farm.

709
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:40,385
All I really want is to be loved.

710
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:46,516
I'm having such a hard time
without it lately.

711
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:26,181
I should probably get going now.

712
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:29,226
Mother will be wondering where I am
if I'm not home soon.

713
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:40,028
Are you frightened of me?

714
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:47,452
Of course not, Pearl.

715
01:26:50,914 --> 01:26:52,541
Do you think I'm sick?

716
01:26:57,838 --> 01:26:59,089
Thank you.

717
01:27:02,718 --> 01:27:04,344
I'm happy for you.

718
01:27:07,681 --> 01:27:09,141
What?

719
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:11,059
For getting the part.

720
01:27:11,143 --> 01:27:13,812
In the dance troupe. You deserved it.

721
01:27:15,856 --> 01:27:18,775
- I didn't get the part.
- It's okay.

722
01:27:19,776 --> 01:27:22,946
You don't have to pretend anymore.
My feelings won't be hurt.

723
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:26,450
If it wasn't me,
I'm glad it was you, right?

724
01:27:29,411 --> 01:27:31,538
- But, Pearl, I...
- Please.

725
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:34,499
Don't lie to me.

726
01:27:41,173 --> 01:27:44,009
Well, yes.

727
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:47,846
Thank you.

728
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:55,270
It's going to be real swell,
dancing around the state.

729
01:27:58,857 --> 01:28:02,277
I hope you can come see the show sometime.

730
01:28:06,156 --> 01:28:08,366
You always get everything you want.

731
01:28:10,744 --> 01:28:12,746
You're younger and more blonde.

732
01:28:15,081 --> 01:28:17,709
I have to go now.

733
01:28:21,588 --> 01:28:24,007
You're not gonna say anything, are you?

734
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:35,977
I really do love Howard.

735
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:39,731
I know.

736
01:28:40,941 --> 01:28:43,360
Nobody has to know.

737
01:28:43,443 --> 01:28:45,070
I can fix things.

738
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:48,740
It can be our secret, Mitsy.

739
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:41,001
Help!

740
01:29:42,168 --> 01:29:43,295
Help me!

741
01:29:44,296 --> 01:29:46,548
Somebody, please help!

742
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:50,468
No! No, please.

743
01:29:50,552 --> 01:29:52,762
Help! Help!

744
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:06,276
Help!

745
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:10,739
Help me, please!

746
01:30:10,822 --> 01:30:13,241
Help!

747
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:24,377
Please, no! No!

748
01:30:24,461 --> 01:30:25,795
I won't tell anyone!

749
01:30:25,879 --> 01:30:27,714
Please, I swear!

750
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:33,094
Please! I'll do anything you want.

751
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:35,931
It's not about what I want anymore, Mitsy.

752
01:30:36,014 --> 01:30:37,015
Please.

753
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:39,851
It's about making the best of what I have.

754
01:30:39,935 --> 01:30:42,562
No! No!

755
01:30:43,939 --> 01:30:44,940
No!

756
01:33:51,459 --> 01:33:53,294
Bless us, O' Lord,

757
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:56,131
and these thy gifts

758
01:33:56,214 --> 01:34:00,218
which we are about to receive
from thy bounty

759
01:34:02,011 --> 01:34:03,930
through Christ our Lord.

760
01:34:05,348 --> 01:34:06,516
Amen.

761
01:34:42,468 --> 01:34:43,678
Home, sweet home!

762
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:48,057
So long, y'all.

763
01:35:06,117 --> 01:35:07,202
Pearl?

764
01:35:13,583 --> 01:35:14,667
Pearl?

765
01:35:36,856 --> 01:35:38,024
Howard?

766
01:35:41,152 --> 01:35:43,571
I'm so happy you're home.
