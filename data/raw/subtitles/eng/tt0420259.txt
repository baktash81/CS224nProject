1
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:32,947
What happened, are you okay?
What's wrong?

2
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:34,962
I stepped on something.

3
00:00:35,087 --> 00:00:37,923
It crackled when I stepped on it.
Then it sort of smooshed.

4
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,382
Then there was this tiny pop.
What is it?

5
00:00:41,173 --> 00:00:43,139
- What is it?
- You mean what was it?

6
00:00:43,265 --> 00:00:45,273
- Do something. Do something!
- All right.

7
00:00:45,398 --> 00:00:47,382
I'm taking off your shoe,
I'll wipe it off.

8
00:00:47,507 --> 00:00:50,256
- No, just throw it away.
- I'm not going to throw it away.

9
00:00:50,443 --> 00:00:51,601
Throw it.

10
00:00:52,725 --> 00:00:54,384
- Did you see that?
- See what?

11
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:56,846
- God, are you okay?
- What are you doing, Natalie?

12
00:00:57,016 --> 00:01:00,440
- Well, he might need help.
- No, he's fine. I can see it from here.

13
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:05,165
None of our business.
Okay, come back here. I command you.

14
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,886
- Are you okay?
- What about me?

15
00:01:07,011 --> 00:01:09,566
- I must've hit a pothole.
- What about me?

16
00:01:09,924 --> 00:01:12,483
Are those yours?
Are those yours?

17
00:01:13,594 --> 00:01:15,754
That's my bolt cutters.
I just came from work.

18
00:01:15,882 --> 00:01:17,194
- They're nice.
- Here.

19
00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:22,638
Hate this chain. They always fall off.
Here, you just snap it back on.

20
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,954
- Thanks a lot.
- There you go.

21
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:27,192
- Glad I could help.
- I'm lucky you came along.

22
00:01:27,317 --> 00:01:28,861
Be careful of the potholes.

23
00:01:29,076 --> 00:01:31,757
Hey, somebody stop that guy!

24
00:01:32,257 --> 00:01:34,954
Don't let him go!
Lady, don't let him go!

25
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:39,623
- What did you do?
- I...

26
00:01:40,165 --> 00:01:43,601
Hey, somebody stop that guy!
He stole my bike!

27
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,282
I feel terrible about what happened.
I didn't know he was stealing the bike.

28
00:02:52,418 --> 00:02:54,772
Nobody got hurt, that's the main thing.

29
00:02:55,894 --> 00:02:58,381
- What is all this?
- It's a research lab.

30
00:02:58,506 --> 00:03:00,135
Agricultural engineering.

31
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:04,146
Dean, Dean Berry founded
betavegatech five years ago.

32
00:03:04,281 --> 00:03:07,503
- So what exactly do you do?
- We're saving the world.

33
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:10,437
Good for you. I was getting
a little worried about the world.

34
00:03:12,538 --> 00:03:14,233
Is that a square tomato?!

35
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:17,548
Yes, it is.
It's a pet project of Dean's.

36
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:21,852
The square shape means that farmers
can pack 35% more tomatoes per carton.

37
00:03:22,193 --> 00:03:25,569
- It's cheaper. More efficient.
- So that means

38
00:03:26,308 --> 00:03:29,391
every slice is exactly the same size?

39
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:32,687
- How does it taste?
- Who cares? It's a square tomato!

40
00:03:33,901 --> 00:03:36,660
- You're doing the lord's work.
- Literally.

41
00:03:39,316 --> 00:03:40,124
Dean?

42
00:03:40,249 --> 00:03:43,550
Mr. Berry, I just wanted
to say I'm sorry about the bike.

43
00:03:44,494 --> 00:03:47,064
We're testing new corn seed.
Their genetically engineered

44
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:49,151
- to sprout in 20 min.
- More or less.

45
00:03:49,276 --> 00:03:51,347
What you're seeing is going
to revolutionize

46
00:03:51,472 --> 00:03:54,982
- the agriculture industry as you know
- Congratulations on the square tomato.

47
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,580
Do you want one?
You could take one home.

48
00:03:58,107 --> 00:04:00,033
- What's our time?
- 17:30.

49
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,839
Germination complete.
That is our best time yet.

50
00:04:03,964 --> 00:04:07,812
And that, boys and girls,
is how you feed 4 billion people.

51
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:11,637
We're in business. Call our investors.
Tell them to bring their checkbooks.

52
00:04:11,762 --> 00:04:14,500
I'll set it up for friday.
Dean, this is Adrian Monk.

53
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,624
And, you remember Natalie Teeger?

54
00:04:16,749 --> 00:04:19,341
Yes, of course.
The woman who stole my bike.

55
00:04:19,597 --> 00:04:22,287
- No, I didn't steal your bike.
- No, you're right.

56
00:04:22,432 --> 00:04:26,420
Aided and abetted.
I believe that that is the term.

57
00:04:26,545 --> 00:04:29,156
I'm sorry, I have to lock these up.
Do you mind turning around?

58
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:31,562
It's just that if somebody
else sees this combination,

59
00:04:31,697 --> 00:04:34,717
I have to memorize a new one. And
I don't want to waste the gray cells.

60
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,891
Mr. Berry,
look, I want to buy you a new bike.

61
00:04:38,035 --> 00:04:41,082
So if you just tell me the make and
the model number, i'm happy to do that.

62
00:04:41,207 --> 00:04:44,256
That's very kind of you, ms. Teeger.
But that's not a bike that can be replaced.

63
00:04:44,391 --> 00:04:46,638
It was a gift from a non-profit
environmental group,

64
00:04:46,763 --> 00:04:50,026
in recognition of my work here.
Had my name engraved on it,

65
00:04:50,151 --> 00:04:53,155
custom seat, cool lock,
eco-friendly hemp basket...

66
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,046
Okay. Then we'll track it down for you.

67
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:58,249
I promise you. I give you my word
that I will find that bike.

68
00:04:58,394 --> 00:05:01,288
Mr. Monk here is probably
the best detective on the planet.

69
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:02,581
- He is?
- Yes, sir.

70
00:05:02,706 --> 00:05:04,712
And I know lots of other detectives too.

71
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,465
San Francisco Police Department.
What's going on? You all right?

72
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,623
Yeah, we're fine.

73
00:05:08,748 --> 00:05:11,429
- You said it was an emergency.
- Somebody stole his bike.

74
00:05:12,244 --> 00:05:14,096
- And?
- Rode away.

75
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,224
- And?
- Didn't come back.

76
00:05:20,646 --> 00:05:21,514
And?

77
00:05:22,707 --> 00:05:26,303
- Okay, we're all cued up.
- Hey, when you have a second...

78
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:28,685
I have an idea for a new vegetable.

79
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,850
We don't really solicit ideas.

80
00:05:30,975 --> 00:05:33,965
It's a hollowed out cumber,
with french dressing already inside.

81
00:05:34,346 --> 00:05:36,553
- You want to know what I call it?
- No, I don't.

82
00:05:36,688 --> 00:05:38,473
Okay, there he is. And that's me.

83
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,546
And this is where
she didn't listen to me.

84
00:05:41,677 --> 00:05:45,657
- What are you saying right there?
- I said, "nice bolt cutters."

85
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:48,665
- "Nice bolt cutters."
- So what do you think?

86
00:05:49,442 --> 00:05:51,911
Well, I think it's clearly
a job for the bike squad.

87
00:05:52,223 --> 00:05:55,966
- I'll radio that in. It's a 487.
- I didn't know there was a bike squad.

88
00:05:56,114 --> 00:06:00,110
Yeah, we got helicopters. About 800
guys will fan out all around the city.

89
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:03,398
Fine.
I'll just do it myself.

90
00:06:05,647 --> 00:06:08,638
I can't find it myself, mr. Monk.
I don't even know where to begin.

91
00:06:08,763 --> 00:06:12,563
Natalie, look at this thing.
We've got nature on the run.

92
00:06:13,045 --> 00:06:15,360
Finally.
Look at that.

93
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,165
Look!

94
00:06:18,184 --> 00:06:22,177
It's the perfect sandwich!
Perfect! There's no overlap.

95
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,411
There's no waste. Four 90 degree angles.

96
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:28,983
This will virtually
eliminate indigestion.

97
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:31,404
Are you going to help me, or not?

98
00:06:34,097 --> 00:06:36,738
- You can taste the symmetry!
- Please!

99
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,921
I can't run around looking
for a stolen bicycle.

100
00:06:41,355 --> 00:06:44,075
I still have some pride left. Not much.

101
00:06:45,184 --> 00:06:47,892
But my dignity tank
isn't completely empty.

102
00:06:48,017 --> 00:06:49,376
Please, Mr. Monk.

103
00:06:49,516 --> 00:06:53,258
You are so brilliant. It wouldn't
take you more than a couple of hours.

104
00:06:53,386 --> 00:06:54,930
Look, I promised him.

105
00:06:55,606 --> 00:06:57,378
It can count as my birthday gift.

106
00:06:58,367 --> 00:07:00,625
I didn't plan on buying
you a birthday gift.

107
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,311
All right. I'm cashing in my chips.

108
00:07:07,696 --> 00:07:09,432
- What chips?
- My karma chips.

109
00:07:09,565 --> 00:07:12,370
I've been collecting karma
chips every week, every day,

110
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,987
every time I do
something stupid for you.

111
00:07:15,612 --> 00:07:19,419
It's your job.
You're paid. Semi-regularly.

112
00:07:19,544 --> 00:07:22,510
Yeah, I'm not talking about my job.
I'm talking about all the other stuff.

113
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:26,166
I've been babysitting you
for five years. I've collected, like,

114
00:07:26,392 --> 00:07:29,522
a thousand chips.
And I'm cashing them all in. I'm all in.

115
00:07:29,647 --> 00:07:31,653
You have to help me find the bike.

116
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,612
You'll love this.
You'll love it.

117
00:07:38,572 --> 00:07:40,231
- Yeah, what about him?
- No.

118
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,592
See he's too tall.
You're guy was only 5'71/2"

119
00:07:43,781 --> 00:07:45,728
- How do you know?
- You're 5'5".

120
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:48,897
You were wearing 11/2" heels.
And he was one inch taller than you.

121
00:07:49,022 --> 00:07:51,071
See. See, you're brilliant.

122
00:07:52,178 --> 00:07:54,633
What are you doing here?
Triple homicide on a pier?

123
00:07:55,212 --> 00:07:58,043
- Not exactly.
- We're looking for a stolen bicycle.

124
00:07:58,482 --> 00:08:01,059
- Kidding, right?
- Natalie had chips.

125
00:08:02,285 --> 00:08:03,308
What about him?

126
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:11,620
You're right.

127
00:08:12,306 --> 00:08:16,300
John kuramoto. Two convictions.
Auto theft?

128
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,266
Why is he stealing bikes?

129
00:08:35,607 --> 00:08:37,382
Please tell me this isn't it.

130
00:08:38,914 --> 00:08:40,996
Yeah, 322. This is it.

131
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:45,088
Am I going to need
a tetanus shot after this?

132
00:08:45,403 --> 00:08:46,599
Probably not.

133
00:08:51,461 --> 00:08:53,615
Mr. Monk, look, the bolt cutters.

134
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,908
Yeah, you're right. Those are nice.

135
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:58,309
Maybe he's riding his bike.
I don't see it.

136
00:08:59,355 --> 00:09:01,142
He's right in there. I can see him.

137
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:03,737
Playing video games, eating junk food.

138
00:09:03,872 --> 00:09:06,062
- What are we doing here?
- The right thing.

139
00:09:12,013 --> 00:09:15,621
Open up...
It's encyclopedia brown.

140
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:18,917
Sally and I want our blue bike back,

141
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,583
and the name of your decorator.

142
00:09:23,283 --> 00:09:26,194
You're not in trouble.
Nobody's going to press charges.

143
00:09:26,338 --> 00:09:27,799
We just want the bike.

144
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,249
All right, just do it again.

145
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:38,027
Oh, my god, mr. Monk!
Oh, my god, mr. Monk!

146
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:41,050
Help!
Help!

147
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:01,695
Mr. Monk, it's me. It's Natalie.
How are you feeling?

148
00:10:02,249 --> 00:10:03,522
My leg!

149
00:10:05,526 --> 00:10:06,992
My legs!

150
00:10:09,737 --> 00:10:11,878
- They don't match!
- I know.

151
00:10:12,013 --> 00:10:14,492
I know they don't, mr. Monk.
I am so sorry.

152
00:10:14,617 --> 00:10:18,344
I am so sorry.
I feel just terrible.

153
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,358
- Good.
- I talked to the surgeon.

154
00:10:22,483 --> 00:10:25,035
And guess what?
You have 100 stitches.

155
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,888
An even 100.
I thought that was nice of him.

156
00:10:28,635 --> 00:10:32,493
And, I brought you some new clothes,
so you don't have to worry about that.

157
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:37,288
Daisies.
100 daisies.

158
00:10:38,261 --> 00:10:41,939
Thank you.
I can watch them die.

159
00:10:43,281 --> 00:10:45,666
And they can do the same for me.

160
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,419
Mr. Monk, don't talk like that.
You're going to be just fine.

161
00:10:49,056 --> 00:10:52,471
Somebody's up. Hello,
good evening. I'm doctor Levinson.

162
00:10:52,596 --> 00:10:55,133
And you are a very lucky man. Yeah.

163
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,676
Is she talking to me?

164
00:10:59,054 --> 00:11:02,034
A few inches over, the bullet
would have severed your femoral artery.

165
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:05,630
- I'd say that's lucky.
- You know who I think is lucky?

166
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,878
Everybody else in this room.

167
00:11:10,195 --> 00:11:12,548
The unshot people.

168
00:11:12,953 --> 00:11:14,979
The great unshot.

169
00:11:16,171 --> 00:11:17,869
The lead-free.

170
00:11:19,113 --> 00:11:21,485
- Bulletless.
- When can I take him home?

171
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:25,583
Maybe tomorrow if he's up to it.
Are you a fighter, mr. Monk?

172
00:11:29,349 --> 00:11:32,408
The kid. Kuramoto...
did they get him?

173
00:11:32,849 --> 00:11:35,009
No, he got away.
He went out the back door.

174
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:37,903
Looks like he took the bike.
It wasn't in the house.

175
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:41,161
The bike. Oh, my god!
That stupid bike.

176
00:11:41,286 --> 00:11:42,267
What bike?

177
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:45,151
That's why we were there.
We were looking for a stolen bike.

178
00:11:45,286 --> 00:11:49,191
Shooting someone over a bicycle?
What's the world coming to?

179
00:11:50,136 --> 00:11:52,282
Mr. Monk, they're going to get him.
The captain,

180
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:55,668
and Randy, and every cop
in the city are looking for this guy.

181
00:11:55,803 --> 00:11:59,323
And the captain, I've never seen
him so mad. And that's saying a lot.

182
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,120
I'm sorry.

183
00:12:07,588 --> 00:12:09,142
You don't know where he is?

184
00:12:09,988 --> 00:12:12,072
You were staying at his house, Vince.

185
00:12:12,407 --> 00:12:14,897
I'm just crashing at
his place for a couple days.

186
00:12:15,241 --> 00:12:18,192
He's just my cousin.
You know where all your cousins are?

187
00:12:20,101 --> 00:12:21,799
Where do you think he is, Vince?

188
00:12:23,386 --> 00:12:25,121
I don't know.

189
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,588
Tough guy.

190
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,839
Look at this. See that? That's a bullet.

191
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,266
That's a bullet that got dug out
of our very dear friend's leg tonight.

192
00:12:43,702 --> 00:12:45,930
That makes your cousin
a former cop shooter.

193
00:12:46,943 --> 00:12:49,248
- Former what?
- Former cop shooter.

194
00:12:49,592 --> 00:12:51,213
You mean he used to shoot cops?

195
00:12:52,027 --> 00:12:54,709
No, he shot someone
who used to be a cop.

196
00:12:54,834 --> 00:12:57,268
- Why didn't you say that?
- D I did. It's the same thing.

197
00:12:57,393 --> 00:12:59,172
It's not the same thing.

198
00:12:59,297 --> 00:13:01,397
For god's sake,
what are you two married, or what?

199
00:13:01,522 --> 00:13:03,686
I mean look,
it's not complicated, Vince.

200
00:13:03,821 --> 00:13:06,445
If you know where your cousin is,
and you're not telling us,

201
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,437
that makes you
an accessory after the fact.

202
00:13:08,562 --> 00:13:10,496
- Aiding and abetting.
- For attempted murder.

203
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:12,879
Which is a very, very long good-bye.

204
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:17,070
Let me put it this way, your parole
officer... he hasn't been born yet.

205
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,252
Look...

206
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,759
You don't know John.
You know, he's not a bad guy.

207
00:13:28,466 --> 00:13:31,704
Somebody offered him,
you know, money to steal a bicycle.

208
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:32,754
Who?

209
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:35,563
I don't know. He met someone
at a bar. That's all I know.

210
00:13:36,635 --> 00:13:39,877
- Someone paid him to steal that bike?
- Yeah, $3,000.

211
00:13:41,723 --> 00:13:42,996
For a bicycle?

212
00:13:49,824 --> 00:13:50,672
Wipe.

213
00:14:00,813 --> 00:14:01,777
Wipe.

214
00:14:11,144 --> 00:14:12,088
Wipe.

215
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:15,947
- Wipe!
- Why don't I push?

216
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,123
Where do you want to go?

217
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:20,862
Over by that wall.

218
00:14:21,858 --> 00:14:24,598
Just planning on staring
at it for a couple of weeks.

219
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:28,812
You know what?
How about right here?

220
00:14:28,937 --> 00:14:31,693
Right in front of this bright,
sunny window.

221
00:14:33,182 --> 00:14:37,175
Told you to forget about that
stupid bike. You never listen to me.

222
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:39,284
Mr. Monk, you're right.
I'm so sorry.

223
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:41,335
This is one of
the worst weeks of my life.

224
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:44,131
Not exactly a banner week for me either.

225
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,525
- Let's look on the bright side.
- Okay. You go first.

226
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,533
The doctor said it was only going to be
three weeks. That's not bad. And...

227
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,472
Your shoes won't get dirty or wet.

228
00:14:54,986 --> 00:14:58,979
That's your bright side?
My shoes won't get wet?

229
00:14:59,778 --> 00:15:02,585
That's not exactly
blindingly bright, is it?

230
00:15:02,795 --> 00:15:05,727
It's more like a little
25 watt bright side.

231
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:08,624
I bet you're hungry.
How about some lunch?

232
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,770
How about a BLT?

233
00:15:10,895 --> 00:15:13,075
And not just any ol'BLT.

234
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,556
I'm going to make you a bl-square-t.

235
00:15:16,681 --> 00:15:19,133
No, thank you.
You know what I am in the mood for?

236
00:15:19,268 --> 00:15:20,863
What? Just tell me. Anything.

237
00:15:21,582 --> 00:15:23,868
- Some chips.
- Chips.

238
00:15:24,253 --> 00:15:26,201
Karma chips.

239
00:15:27,764 --> 00:15:29,288
I love them.

240
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:33,514
Just a big bowl of karma chips.

241
00:15:34,662 --> 00:15:36,204
And guacamole.

242
00:15:37,377 --> 00:15:39,976
Mr. Monk, believe me.
You have all the chips.

243
00:15:40,101 --> 00:15:42,125
You have the whole bank, okay?

244
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:45,327
I talked to Julie. I told her i'm going
to be staying here with you tonight,

245
00:15:45,452 --> 00:15:48,775
maybe all weekend. And you can
forget about paying me overtime.

246
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,711
- I'll just take the regular salary.
- That's right. It's payday, isn't it?

247
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,746
I wasn't bringing it
up because it's payday.

248
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:58,010
- I'm saying you don't have to pay...
- I'm sorry.

249
00:15:58,135 --> 00:16:01,819
My checkbook is up there.
On the top shelf.

250
00:16:02,473 --> 00:16:04,373
I can't seem to reach it.

251
00:16:07,028 --> 00:16:09,406
Hey, How's our patient?
You look great.

252
00:16:09,613 --> 00:16:12,075
Nice wheels.
Does that thing have a motor?

253
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:15,790
I'm the motor. I just feel terrible.
This is all my fault.

254
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,705
Hey, don't beat yourself up.

255
00:16:18,338 --> 00:16:20,281
Let her finish.
What were you saying?

256
00:16:20,652 --> 00:16:21,887
How sorry I was.

257
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,126
- That it?
- How bad I feel.

258
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,745
We got the forensics back
on that bullet. It was a 22 caliber.

259
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,845
And get this. We picked up Kuramoto's
cousin. He says it wasn't random.

260
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:36,440
Kuramoto was after that particular bike.

261
00:16:36,835 --> 00:16:37,798
You're kidding.

262
00:16:37,923 --> 00:16:40,394
Somebody paid him
three grand to boost it.

263
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:42,075
$3,000?

264
00:16:42,942 --> 00:16:46,542
Natalie, you got a good look at it. Was
there anything unusual about that bike?

265
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:49,046
- Like what?
- Solid gold basket?

266
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:51,918
No, I don't think it
had a solid gold basket.

267
00:16:52,103 --> 00:16:55,151
Maybe the frame was hollow
and had something inside it.

268
00:16:55,664 --> 00:16:56,773
Drugs or cash.

269
00:16:56,898 --> 00:16:59,556
That's what I was thinking. I think
we need to go talk to Dr. Berry again.

270
00:16:59,681 --> 00:17:02,215
We're on our way to his house
right now. You want to come?

271
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,369
I don't think so.

272
00:17:03,494 --> 00:17:05,762
You're going to hang out here
feeling sorry for yourself?

273
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,722
- And complain to Natalie?
- That's the plan.

274
00:17:11,294 --> 00:17:13,713
- Hey, What are you doing?!
- Change of plans.

275
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:15,868
Change of plans?
What happened to my plan?

276
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,086
New plan.

277
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:38,169
- Are your hands clean?
- Yes, my hands are clean.

278
00:17:38,294 --> 00:17:40,351
- Come on. Upsy-daisy.
- All right, easy now.

279
00:17:40,653 --> 00:17:42,539
That's too fast. You're going too fast.

280
00:17:42,664 --> 00:17:44,313
- This is too fast?
- Easy.

281
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:49,578
Okay... just... step away.
I can do it myself.

282
00:17:49,817 --> 00:17:51,759
- Step away. I can do it.
- All right.

283
00:17:51,884 --> 00:17:53,165
- All right.
- I'll do it.

284
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,723
I can't do it myself. I can't.

285
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:13,972
- Come on. Up you come.
- All right, easy now. Okay, one...

286
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:17,224
- Ready.
- Okay! What, what?

287
00:18:18,862 --> 00:18:21,776
I can do it! I'll do it.
Let me do it.

288
00:18:22,525 --> 00:18:23,682
I'll do it.

289
00:18:33,974 --> 00:18:37,273
I can't do it.
I can't do it myself. Help m...

290
00:18:38,771 --> 00:18:41,188
Come here.
There you go.

291
00:18:41,313 --> 00:18:43,185
I can't find the release on this thing.

292
00:18:43,315 --> 00:18:46,295
- It's the red latch on the handle.
- This one?

293
00:18:46,783 --> 00:18:49,507
- On the handle. The other one.
- The red handle.

294
00:18:49,632 --> 00:18:51,021
Okay, see?

295
00:18:52,735 --> 00:18:54,953
- Pull it, pull it.
- Just step on the thing.

296
00:18:56,695 --> 00:18:58,238
You got to unlock it.

297
00:19:08,677 --> 00:19:11,187
Grab that side.
Pull. Pull.

298
00:19:11,321 --> 00:19:13,440
- Just push it down. There you go.
- All right.

299
00:19:15,744 --> 00:19:17,540
I got you. I got you.

300
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,217
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

301
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:31,201
- Easy.
- The solar panel.

302
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:36,042
- Must be "off the grid."
- Go slow.

303
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,673
Slow.
Easy, easy.

304
00:19:40,294 --> 00:19:41,143
Slow.

305
00:19:44,134 --> 00:19:46,518
- Okay, and... up.
- Easy.

306
00:19:46,842 --> 00:19:49,554
I'll get it. Here we go.
On three.

307
00:19:49,901 --> 00:19:51,811
- Easy.
- One, two, three.

308
00:19:54,014 --> 00:19:55,036
Hang on.

309
00:19:57,309 --> 00:19:59,181
God! God, that...

310
00:20:06,013 --> 00:20:09,185
- All right.
- Nobody's home.

311
00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:12,007
Sorry.

312
00:20:13,342 --> 00:20:15,899
I do have one suggestion.
Just a thought.

313
00:20:16,411 --> 00:20:18,283
Next time we go somewhere...

314
00:20:19,745 --> 00:20:21,306
Call ahead first.

315
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:24,555
Easy, easy.

316
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,800
- Go easy.
- Easy!

317
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,820
I thought you guys were
joking about the bike squad.

318
00:20:32,945 --> 00:20:34,831
- I like that car.
- Look at that.

319
00:20:34,956 --> 00:20:36,528
- Who is it?
- Look at that thing.

320
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,539
What kind of gas mileage
do you get with this?

321
00:20:38,664 --> 00:20:40,887
Mileage? I haven't worried
about mileage in years.

322
00:20:41,012 --> 00:20:44,570
This is aerodynamically perfect.
100% fossil-free.

323
00:20:44,695 --> 00:20:47,711
Built-in solar panels.
This is the future on wheels.

324
00:20:48,783 --> 00:20:50,056
What happened to you?

325
00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:53,289
Had chips.

326
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:56,838
We were looking for your stolen bike,
and Mr. Monk got shot.

327
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,417
Man. What is happening to us?

328
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,933
The family of man, we're hurting each
other, we're stealing from each other.

329
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,555
Family of man's starting
to sound like a real family.

330
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:10,437
You know what I'm going to do for you?
I am going to adopt ten acres

331
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:13,505
- of Brazilian rain forest in your name.
- Thank you.

332
00:21:14,287 --> 00:21:16,127
I don't have to visit it, do i? Or...

333
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,502
or water it? Or think about it?

334
00:21:20,316 --> 00:21:21,454
Professor Berry...

335
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,428
Somebody paid that young
man to steal your bicycle.

336
00:21:24,553 --> 00:21:26,224
Apparently they paid him a lot of money.

337
00:21:26,349 --> 00:21:29,177
- You're kidding.
- We were hoping you could tell us why.

338
00:21:29,302 --> 00:21:31,285
Was there anything
unusual about your bike?

339
00:21:31,455 --> 00:21:33,009
- Like what?
- A gold basket.

340
00:21:33,362 --> 00:21:34,250
Or...

341
00:21:35,376 --> 00:21:37,611
- Or what?
- Or anything else.

342
00:21:37,736 --> 00:21:41,077
Could some... could somethin
have been hidden inside the frame?

343
00:21:41,298 --> 00:21:42,566
I can't imagine it.

344
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:45,903
The frame was filled with polycarbonate
honeycomb for better stability.

345
00:21:46,303 --> 00:21:48,103
I understand the bike was a gift?

346
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:52,338
- It was. From the visionary project.
- I've never heard of them.

347
00:21:52,463 --> 00:21:54,180
Neither had I until the bike arrived.

348
00:21:54,467 --> 00:21:57,592
Sarah Longson, my assistant, wheeled
it in with a big bow, and a very,

349
00:21:57,723 --> 00:21:59,225
very complimentary letter.

350
00:21:59,456 --> 00:22:01,559
- Do you still have the letter?
- I shredded it.

351
00:22:01,684 --> 00:22:03,643
- Repulped it. Recycled it.
- Of course you did.

352
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,227
That's okay, we can figure
out who they are if they do exist.

353
00:22:07,352 --> 00:22:09,349
I don't understand.
It doesn't make any sense.

354
00:22:09,474 --> 00:22:12,368
Well, one thing's for sure,
it makes a lot of sense to somebody.

355
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:25,158
- Over here.
- You scared me.

356
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,122
Were you followed?

357
00:22:27,495 --> 00:22:30,047
It's cool, it's cool.
I did what you said. I took two buses.

358
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:32,951
Sorry about that cop.
Okay, I... I didn't have a choice.

359
00:22:33,076 --> 00:22:35,996
I got two strikes against me already.
I couldn't take another hit.

360
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:38,923
Of course, it couldn't be helped.
It was him or you, right?

361
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,005
It's payday.

362
00:22:41,957 --> 00:22:44,349
There's a little extra in there.
Travel expenses.

363
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:46,975
You shot a cop. You're going
to have to disappear for a while.

364
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,583
I don't see a problem with that.
If you're ever in Mexico, look me up.

365
00:22:51,313 --> 00:22:53,034
You have something for me?

366
00:22:56,298 --> 00:22:57,244
Right here.

367
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:04,384
And the gun you shot Adrian Monk with?
You better give it to me.

368
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:07,336
It's the only evidence they have
against us. I'll get rid of it.

369
00:23:15,504 --> 00:23:17,588
- Thanks.
- So I guess this is good-bye.

370
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,394
Couldn't have said it better myself.

371
00:23:35,635 --> 00:23:38,683
- Sorry, sorry.
- Wait, wait, wait.

372
00:23:39,014 --> 00:23:40,471
- Careful!
- Sorry.

373
00:23:40,596 --> 00:23:43,065
Well, what are you...
It's over there. What are you doing?

374
00:23:44,613 --> 00:23:47,834
Just... easy, would you?
Please slow down.

375
00:23:48,055 --> 00:23:49,230
I'm sorry.

376
00:23:50,526 --> 00:23:52,194
Sorry Mrs. Corren.

377
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:55,788
What are you apologizing to her for?
Did you get her shot too?

378
00:23:55,913 --> 00:23:57,030
Oh, god.

379
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:03,188
I'm sorry, I'm just... you know what?
Hold... I'm just tired, mr. Monk.

380
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:06,060
I was up all night building
that ramp for your back door.

381
00:24:06,185 --> 00:24:09,161
- Well the ramp was your idea.
- I know, and I'm happy to do it.

382
00:24:09,286 --> 00:24:11,679
It's just that I haven't
been home in three days.

383
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,570
And I haven't seen my daughter.

384
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:16,747
I understand. Why don't you take
the rest of the day off?

385
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:20,105
- Really?
- Sure. I can make my own dinner.

386
00:24:20,351 --> 00:24:23,763
I'll just eat whatever's on the bottom
shelf. You know, whatever I can reach.

387
00:24:23,888 --> 00:24:25,418
Whatever's in the crisper.

388
00:24:25,634 --> 00:24:28,374
Then I'll just hop around for a while,
and drag myself into bed.

389
00:24:28,517 --> 00:24:30,119
- You go have fun.
- I'll stay.

390
00:24:30,244 --> 00:24:32,278
- It's up to you.
- How are you? Are you okay?

391
00:24:32,403 --> 00:24:34,641
- I've been better.
- Not you. How are you?

392
00:24:35,716 --> 00:24:39,559
I'm fine. We're fine.
Just getting a workout with my arms.

393
00:24:40,384 --> 00:24:41,978
- Is it the guy?
- Yes, sir.

394
00:24:42,103 --> 00:24:44,207
John Kuramoto, the mystery bike thief.

395
00:24:44,593 --> 00:24:47,200
Couple cemetery workers
found him about an hour ago.

396
00:24:47,775 --> 00:24:49,480
Pretty convenient place to catch it.

397
00:24:49,785 --> 00:24:53,760
We found the shell. 32 caliber. Probably
from the same gun they used on you.

398
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,985
I can't believe he's dead.
What is it about that bike?

399
00:24:57,115 --> 00:24:59,372
We talked to the visionary project too.

400
00:24:59,527 --> 00:25:02,532
They never heard of dean berry.
And they never sent anyone a bike.

401
00:25:05,352 --> 00:25:06,542
To the left.

402
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,441
A little more slowly.
Slowly. A little more.

403
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,758
That's too far. Back to the right.

404
00:25:14,985 --> 00:25:18,426
Slowly, slowly, slowly...
that's too much! Too much!

405
00:25:18,553 --> 00:25:21,766
- Why don't you just turn your neck?
- Because this the way I want to do it.

406
00:25:22,245 --> 00:25:23,813
Keep going to the right.

407
00:25:25,037 --> 00:25:28,355
Wait, wait. Okay, wait,
Right there.

408
00:25:31,923 --> 00:25:35,000
- It's a tire track.
- Is that from the bike?

409
00:25:37,142 --> 00:25:40,185
- No, it's not a bike. It was wider.
- Was it a car?

410
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:43,531
I can't tell.
There's more over there.

411
00:25:44,756 --> 00:25:48,701
And some over there.
It keeps changing direction. You know?

412
00:25:49,277 --> 00:25:50,794
I don't know if I can... maybe.

413
00:25:51,511 --> 00:25:53,672
I don't... is that...
Is that one right there?

414
00:25:56,011 --> 00:25:59,238
- Oh, my god, Mr. Monk are you okay?
- What did you do?

415
00:25:59,431 --> 00:26:02,974
- I didn't do anything.
- Help me up! Wait, wait.

416
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,913
No, wait. I have a better idea.

417
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:08,537
As long I'm down here, would just shovel
some dirt over me. Get it over with.

418
00:26:08,672 --> 00:26:10,532
- Natalie, take a break.
- Are you sure?

419
00:26:10,673 --> 00:26:13,036
I got him.
We'll meet you back at the car.

420
00:26:13,161 --> 00:26:14,859
Come here. Come on.

421
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,222
There we go.
All right.

422
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:24,015
Yeah, we'll take a photograph.
Do you got a minute?

423
00:26:25,797 --> 00:26:28,065
- Do I have a min? I'm in a wheelchair.
- Look...

424
00:26:28,293 --> 00:26:30,913
I know that this is tough,
but this is tough on Natalie too.

425
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:34,596
You see this guy here? That's the guy
that shot you. The guy in the body bag.

426
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,247
And you're madder
at her than you are at him.

427
00:26:38,075 --> 00:26:41,225
- She hasn't said anything.
- Of course she hasn't said anything.

428
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:44,034
She blames herself for what happened.
She...

429
00:26:45,797 --> 00:26:48,517
Look, I know you caught a bad break.
I'm sorry you're in pain.

430
00:26:48,642 --> 00:26:50,866
Sorry you're miserable. Sorry, sorry.

431
00:26:50,991 --> 00:26:53,822
But you can't keep taking
everything out on her.

432
00:26:54,437 --> 00:26:55,776
Listen, detective Monk...

433
00:26:57,043 --> 00:27:00,276
Be very careful, because you're
that close from losing that girl.

434
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:01,895
Ask me how I know.

435
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,785
- How do you know?
- Because you're acting like me.

436
00:27:37,807 --> 00:27:38,945
Oh, god.

437
00:27:46,403 --> 00:27:47,966
Natalie, do you resent me?

438
00:27:48,773 --> 00:27:52,449
Don't be silly. You were shot
in the leg. You're seriously injured.

439
00:27:53,686 --> 00:27:55,056
That's what I thought.

440
00:27:55,796 --> 00:27:58,338
The captain is concerned about you.

441
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:02,626
He doesn't understand our relationship.
Pothole!

442
00:28:02,846 --> 00:28:04,646
- Pothole.
- Sorry. Sorry.

443
00:28:05,405 --> 00:28:07,817
- Where to next?
- Let me see.

444
00:28:09,493 --> 00:28:12,234
Okay, we have to go up
to the mountain view deli.

445
00:28:12,363 --> 00:28:14,981
And back down to the valley pharmacy.

446
00:28:15,191 --> 00:28:17,834
And then back up to
the hilltop dry cleaner.

447
00:28:18,695 --> 00:28:21,456
Do you think we could combine
the mountain view deli and

448
00:28:21,615 --> 00:28:23,303
the hilltop cleaners? Just

449
00:28:23,693 --> 00:28:26,207
before we do the valley thing,
so we're not going

450
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:29,495
- up, and down, and...
- I know.

451
00:28:31,124 --> 00:28:33,343
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

452
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:41,518
I can't go on. I can't go on like this.
I can't keep on apologizing.

453
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:45,716
I'm sorry, I haven't slept
in three days. I'm going broke.

454
00:28:45,841 --> 00:28:49,365
Your insurance wouldn't cover
the wheelchair. I had to rent it myself.

455
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,642
Just let me finish, okay?
I didn't shoot you, Mr. Monk.

456
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:58,588
You have to forgive people.
Say you forgive me.

457
00:28:58,713 --> 00:29:01,809
Three little words, that's all I need.
Just three little words and it'll just

458
00:29:01,934 --> 00:29:03,802
- release me.
- Natalie, we're braked.

459
00:29:03,927 --> 00:29:06,773
You're right, I just got to pick it up.
I don't need a break.

460
00:29:09,078 --> 00:29:10,283
I don't need a break.

461
00:29:16,257 --> 00:29:18,021
- Is that it?
- Yes, sir.

462
00:29:18,151 --> 00:29:20,751
"For professor Dean Berry
in deepest appreciation."

463
00:29:20,876 --> 00:29:22,832
That's the bike.
And it was in the dumpster?

464
00:29:22,957 --> 00:29:25,209
Yes, sir. We downloaded this unit

465
00:29:25,446 --> 00:29:28,070
at approximately 14:30 this afternoon.

466
00:29:28,215 --> 00:29:31,065
I read about the stolen bike
in the paper, and the officer

467
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,161
that was shot over it.
I like to read the police blotter.

468
00:29:34,286 --> 00:29:36,724
- Is that a fact?
- I think it's my civic duty. You see,

469
00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:38,771
I like to think
of the sanitation department

470
00:29:38,915 --> 00:29:40,905
as being the eyes
and the ears of the city.

471
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:44,187
Captain, this is Ronnie O'dell.
He's been...

472
00:29:44,396 --> 00:29:45,988
- very helpful.
- Sounds like it.

473
00:29:46,113 --> 00:29:48,151
So the bike was just
sitting there on top?

474
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:51,628
No sir. It was buried. It was on or
beneath, what we like to call

475
00:29:51,753 --> 00:29:53,987
the "nadir," see,
which is very important to us.

476
00:29:54,112 --> 00:29:56,416
Because we know when
this unit was last emptied.

477
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:58,605
Which means
that we can pinpoint the day,

478
00:29:58,742 --> 00:30:01,860
and even approximate
the time when the bike was discarded.

479
00:30:02,004 --> 00:30:04,563
- Which was...?
- 3:30. Monday afternoon.

480
00:30:04,727 --> 00:30:06,926
About 20 minutes after it was stolen.

481
00:30:08,316 --> 00:30:12,138
The bike rack is about a 1/2 mile
away. So what, the guy steals the bike,

482
00:30:12,263 --> 00:30:14,919
he rides a couple of blocks,
and then throws it away?

483
00:30:15,044 --> 00:30:16,540
- Yes, sir.
- Apparently.

484
00:30:16,955 --> 00:30:19,573
He didn't want the bike.
After all of this.

485
00:30:20,816 --> 00:30:23,535
- What the hell's going on?
- We don't know, sir.

486
00:30:23,758 --> 00:30:26,459
Frankly, the lieutenant and I...
We're stymied.

487
00:30:28,221 --> 00:30:29,398
We found the basket.

488
00:30:30,892 --> 00:30:34,124
Randy, get it over with. Tell me now.
Is the basket made of gold?

489
00:30:34,801 --> 00:30:38,640
No, it's a basic basket. The...
he've been through this whole truck,

490
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:42,436
only thing we can't find...
Is the bell, the cable, and the lock.

491
00:30:42,561 --> 00:30:43,700
Wait a second.

492
00:30:45,406 --> 00:30:46,622
What do you got?

493
00:30:48,186 --> 00:30:50,848
Good, you found the bell.
Thank you.

494
00:30:52,773 --> 00:30:54,779
You can stop ringing the bell now.

495
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:04,979
- 52.30.
- I don't understand.

496
00:31:07,358 --> 00:31:09,787
I do not understand.

497
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:13,350
It's not working.

498
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:17,121
I don't understand.

499
00:31:25,828 --> 00:31:26,928
Oh, god.

500
00:31:34,098 --> 00:31:36,514
- Does this look green?
- Sorry.

501
00:31:36,826 --> 00:31:39,524
What happened? What went wrong?

502
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:43,325
What is missing? These compounds
are identical. I checked them twice.

503
00:31:44,281 --> 00:31:46,352
I wish I could stay and help,
but I'm leaving

504
00:31:46,477 --> 00:31:48,827
in ten minutes. My china trip, rember?

505
00:31:50,138 --> 00:31:52,855
I forgot.
The yangtze river awaits.

506
00:31:53,739 --> 00:31:56,135
I'm being so selfish. Of course.
I want you to go.

507
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:59,057
And I want you to have fun.
Don't worry about me.

508
00:32:01,381 --> 00:32:03,114
Oh, my god. You found it!

509
00:32:03,335 --> 00:32:06,051
Mr. Berry, I've been waiting
all week all week to say this.

510
00:32:06,942 --> 00:32:07,858
Where was it?

511
00:32:07,983 --> 00:32:11,004
It was in some dumpster up the street.
I tried to clean it as best as I could.

512
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:14,649
You didn't need to do that.
I owe you an apology.

513
00:32:14,921 --> 00:32:17,950
In fact, I owe an apology
to the entire family of man.

514
00:32:18,183 --> 00:32:19,847
This is just what the doctor ordered.

515
00:32:19,974 --> 00:32:21,609
- Good.
- Especially after today.

516
00:32:21,734 --> 00:32:25,027
We had some investors here,
and, the seeds didn't work.

517
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:26,889
I'm so sorry.

518
00:32:28,351 --> 00:32:30,589
- It's still a little dirty right there.
- That's okay.

519
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:33,150
- But i, you know...
- God, it's in good shape.

520
00:32:33,436 --> 00:32:36,131
It looks like i'm not
the only one with a new set of wheels!

521
00:32:36,266 --> 00:32:39,658
We had a... little accident.
With the other wheelchair.

522
00:32:39,783 --> 00:32:41,885
- She tried to kill me.
- So we upgraded.

523
00:32:47,014 --> 00:32:49,753
This dang thing is stuck now.

524
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:53,037
- Here.
- All right. I can do it.

525
00:32:53,215 --> 00:32:55,742
Let me do it. I am not a...

526
00:32:57,295 --> 00:32:59,829
- Let me do it.
- All right.

527
00:33:06,955 --> 00:33:10,155
Natalie, now...
Look what you made me do.

528
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,022
Mr. Monk.
Is there a kill switch on that?

529
00:33:13,147 --> 00:33:15,192
Stop it! Help, help.

530
00:33:21,163 --> 00:33:22,536
Stop it! God.

531
00:33:23,856 --> 00:33:27,166
- Oh, god. Here you go.
- You're okay. You're okay.

532
00:33:30,644 --> 00:33:34,219
God. Watch it, watch it.
You're hurting me.

533
00:33:34,521 --> 00:33:36,884
Do something, no...
She's fainted down.

534
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,893
This goes... on.

535
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:51,202
Look what you've done. This

536
00:33:51,555 --> 00:33:54,352
death trap is worse
than the other death trap.

537
00:33:55,976 --> 00:33:57,171
Sorry, Mr. Monk.

538
00:34:00,124 --> 00:34:01,474
Are you all right?

539
00:34:03,295 --> 00:34:04,742
Is Mr. Monk okay?

540
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,993
This girl is dehydrated.

541
00:34:10,087 --> 00:34:12,634
Has she not had
a steady intake of fluids?

542
00:34:14,769 --> 00:34:17,258
- I don't know.
- Has she been sleeping?

543
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:22,438
- I don't know.
- Does she eat?

544
00:34:24,672 --> 00:34:26,923
Well, I think... I don't know.

545
00:34:28,998 --> 00:34:30,174
Stay right here.

546
00:34:31,052 --> 00:34:33,791
I'm going to get you
some juice and some vitamins.

547
00:34:34,593 --> 00:34:36,792
- Okay, thanks.
- You're going to be fine.

548
00:34:43,784 --> 00:34:45,308
Dear god. What have I done?

549
00:34:59,872 --> 00:35:00,740
Wipe?

550
00:35:12,606 --> 00:35:15,414
I've been a fool.
I've been a Jerk. I'm so sorry.

551
00:35:17,612 --> 00:35:18,795
Here, go like this.

552
00:35:20,378 --> 00:35:21,592
Go like this.

553
00:35:24,502 --> 00:35:25,774
What are you doing?

554
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:28,911
Those are chips.
I'm giving them all back to you.

555
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:32,831
I'm sorry. Leland was right. I have been

556
00:35:33,326 --> 00:35:35,120
taking everything out on you.

557
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:40,209
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you, Mr. Monk.

558
00:35:40,718 --> 00:35:44,018
- See, was that so hard?
- It was pretty hard.

559
00:35:45,523 --> 00:35:46,835
Here, drink this.

560
00:35:47,248 --> 00:35:50,650
I want you to take three of these, twice
a day. It's my personal formula.

561
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,966
- You're going to be fine.
- Thank you.

562
00:35:53,091 --> 00:35:55,409
Mr. Monk, we should go.
They've had a bad day.

563
00:35:55,788 --> 00:35:57,660
Their super seed didn't sprout.

564
00:35:58,437 --> 00:36:00,936
We'll be fine.
It's back to the drawing board.

565
00:36:01,061 --> 00:36:04,290
Back To the gene splicer.
Thank you again, for the bike.

566
00:36:04,415 --> 00:36:06,726
- Just don't leave it unlocked.
- It was locked.

567
00:36:10,652 --> 00:36:13,584
- They never found the lock.
- Pardon me?

568
00:36:17,571 --> 00:36:19,655
The lock that came with your bike...

569
00:36:19,918 --> 00:36:22,211
They found the basket, and the bell,

570
00:36:23,011 --> 00:36:24,587
but they never found the lock.

571
00:36:25,612 --> 00:36:27,706
- What did it look like?
- The lock?

572
00:36:27,831 --> 00:36:31,362
It was kind of a high-tech thing,
with a... a keypad.

573
00:36:33,227 --> 00:36:36,106
- Like that one?
- Yeah, as a matter of fact.

574
00:36:36,604 --> 00:36:40,058
And you could set your own combination?

575
00:36:40,445 --> 00:36:42,149
That's right. Eight digits.

576
00:36:44,386 --> 00:36:45,948
Are you going somewhere?

577
00:36:48,453 --> 00:36:52,039
As a matter of fact, I am.
China.
For three weeks.

578
00:36:53,506 --> 00:36:54,642
Professor berry,

579
00:36:54,915 --> 00:36:58,522
I can tell you why your experiment
failed today, it was sabotaged.

580
00:36:59,714 --> 00:37:00,712
And she did it.

581
00:37:01,661 --> 00:37:02,989
You must be joking!

582
00:37:03,114 --> 00:37:06,404
You hired John Kuramoto
to steal that bike.

583
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,540
But it was never really about the bike,
was it? You wanted the lock.

584
00:37:11,485 --> 00:37:12,816
Here's what happened...

585
00:37:13,112 --> 00:37:15,850
Those genetically altered
seeds were worth a fortune.

586
00:37:15,975 --> 00:37:17,769
You could sell them to anyone.

587
00:37:17,994 --> 00:37:20,097
Your friends in China, for instance.

588
00:37:20,225 --> 00:37:23,610
All you need was the combination.
Your plan was simple.

589
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:27,051
You showed up with a new bike,
you said it was a gift.

590
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:30,910
It was an ordinary bike,
but the lock was something special.

591
00:37:31,195 --> 00:37:35,127
You had designed it yourself.
It had an eight digit combination.

592
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,389
You knew your boss.

593
00:37:36,523 --> 00:37:39,439
You knew he'd never memorize
a whole new set of numbers.

594
00:37:39,564 --> 00:37:41,332
If somebody else sees this combination,

595
00:37:41,457 --> 00:37:44,289
I have to memorize a new one, and
I don't want to waste the grey cells.

596
00:37:44,414 --> 00:37:45,457
She was right.

597
00:37:46,151 --> 00:37:48,554
- I used the same combination.
- Most people do.

598
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:51,373
It's human nature.
I use the same password for everything.

599
00:37:52,202 --> 00:37:55,694
Kuramoto stole the bike,
and more importantly, the lock.

600
00:37:55,826 --> 00:37:57,310
That night, you went to work.

601
00:37:57,769 --> 00:38:01,627
All you had to do was
retrieve the new combination.

602
00:38:05,948 --> 00:38:09,749
As you predicted, he had use
the same numbers for both.

603
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:15,414
You replaced the genetically
altered seeds with a few ordinary ones.

604
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:19,393
You knew you'd be long gone
by the time anybody suspected anything.

605
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:23,447
Dean, who is this guy?
I don't have to listen to this.

606
00:38:23,578 --> 00:38:25,588
- You can't prove any of it.
- It's true.

607
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:29,463
We'll never find those seeds now.
You had five days to hide them.

608
00:38:29,923 --> 00:38:32,685
But we can prove that you killed
Mr. Kuramoto.

609
00:38:36,048 --> 00:38:39,424
Are those your sandals?
They're quite unusual.

610
00:38:39,647 --> 00:38:42,689
They're made from recycled tires.
They're eco-friendly.

611
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:45,153
They may be eco,
but they're not friendly.

612
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:51,849
I've seen those tread marks before.

613
00:38:52,709 --> 00:38:55,449
In the cemetery, near Kuramoto's body.

614
00:38:56,295 --> 00:38:57,894
I thought they were tire tracks.

615
00:38:58,019 --> 00:39:00,064
Sarah, tell me the truth.
Did you do this?

616
00:39:02,586 --> 00:39:04,795
My eyes!
I'm fine. Get her!

617
00:39:05,131 --> 00:39:07,628
Get her, don't let her get away.
I'm fine.

618
00:39:33,389 --> 00:39:36,628
Hold on! Don't move. Just stop!
Put it down. Put it down.

619
00:39:36,784 --> 00:39:39,331
Don't move, I swear to god.
I swear to god i'll shoot.

620
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:43,541
- Hang on!
- It's okay, Mr. Monk.

621
00:39:43,723 --> 00:39:45,460
It's all over. I did it!

622
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,837
For the love of god.

623
00:39:53,658 --> 00:39:54,507
Wipe.

624
00:40:01,727 --> 00:40:02,844
You're awake.

625
00:40:05,372 --> 00:40:06,915
Yes, Mr. Monk. I'm right here.

626
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:15,297
- Chips.
- I know, Mr. Monk.

627
00:40:16,869 --> 00:40:20,178
- Chips.
- Mr. Monk, you have all the chips.

628
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,173
- Chips.
- Yes.

629
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:29,054
Mr Monk, I understand
every chip there is.

630
00:40:32,128 --> 00:40:36,103
Look, on the bright side,
these two legs match.
