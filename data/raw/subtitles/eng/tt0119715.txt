00:01:06,616 --> 00:01:10,347
- Hold your end up higher.
You're not holding it.
- I am too.

2
00:01:10,386 --> 00:01:13,719
- You are not.
- Don't worry about me.

3
00:01:13,757 --> 00:01:16,225
Mm.

4
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,719
- Hey, isn't that suit charcoal?
- No.

5
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:24,757
Looks charcoal gray to me.
Some gray polyester blend.

6
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:28,396
You'd think you could find a black suit
for your own father's funeral.

7
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:30,769
- It's black.
- No. I'm sure it's gray.

8
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,774
- It's black. Black.
- Gray. Gray!

9
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:35,970
- Black!
- Fine, it's black.

10
00:01:36,045 --> 00:01:38,172
It's the grayest black
I've ever seen.

11
00:01:38,248 --> 00:01:40,682
- It doesn't matter what color it is!
- Oww!

12
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,683
I'm sorry, Pop.
I'm sorry!

[Thunks, Splashes]

14
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,698
- Quick! Get him out of there!
- He's halfway to the harbor by now, bub.

15
00:02:04,774 --> 00:02:06,708
Ah, well.

not just a model factory...

17

more valuable.

"And thus it is
my dying wish...

21
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:41,757
that my two sons run
Smuntz String together."

22
00:04:41,831 --> 00:04:45,096
Great. Let's stick a "For Sale" sign
on the lawn and see what we can get.

23
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:49,127
Ernie, we're not supposed to sell it.
We're supposed to run it together.

24
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:53,733
Either way, this godforsaken museum
piece is not worth a dime,
now is it, Lars?

25
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,042
Some things are more important
than money, Ernie.

26
00:04:58,114 --> 00:05:01,140
Notice it's always the
financially challenged who say that?

27
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:04,186

[Ernie] My goodness,
what a treasure. What a legacy.

34
00:05:29,712 --> 00:05:32,647
Spoons! Spoons!

35
00:05:32,715 --> 00:05:35,809
So many spoons,
so little time.

36
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:39,150
Oh! And, of course, something
no household should be without.

37
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:41,986
The ceramic egg!
Ooh-hoo-hoo.

38
00:05:42,058 --> 00:05:44,993
Can I have the egg?
Can I? Huh? Huh? No.

39
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:48,519
- I want you to have it.
- Fine, I'll take it!

00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:52,466
If you find any real estate
on that desk, let me know.

41
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:54,662
It seems there
is also a house.

42
00:05:54,737 --> 00:05:57,672
- [Together] A house?
- Yes, "5120 Nortondale."

[Chuckles] Your father acquired it
many years ago as payment of a debt.

44
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:07,611
He-He never lived there,
but i-i-it's interesting.

45
00:06:07,683 --> 00:06:12,552
It seems the previous owner was found
locked in a trunk in the attic.

46
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,056
Wait a minute.
Is it worth anything?

47
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:18,287
Well, he was able to borrow
$50,000 against it to pay his workers.

48
00:06:18,361 --> 00:06:22,092
Really? So, what
is its value today?

49
00:06:22,165 --> 00:06:24,099
$50,000.

50
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:28,797
Great. A worthless house and
a broken-down string factory.

51
00:06:28,871 --> 00:06:32,773
Oh, well. At least the day
wasn't a total loss.

52
00:06:32,842 --> 00:06:35,572
Thanks for
the stogies, Pop.

00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:39,513
Wait. You can't go. Ernie, we-we
have to go through all these papers.

to excuse me.

Mr. Mayor, do you think your
recent triple heart bypass will
affect your campaign strategy?

Now, Leslie,
I'm just here to eat.

Ah, monsieur le maire, Madame

it is to have you in my humble bistro.

Bonjour!

before I hit it big.

[Man] Smuntz String
is a relic of history.

96
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:45,228
You don't make string by twining
two strands together anymore.

97
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:49,567
No. You make it simple,
singular, strong, with nylon.

98
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:52,767
Bu-But that's not string.
Tha-That's cord.

- Exactly.
- Twine is yesterday.

- Single-strand cord is today.
- Zeppco International...

years, but your father refused to sell.

to buy you out...

104

and bring this museum
into the 21st century.

on as a string consultant,

- Ernie!
- Yeah. Just a sec.

00:10:48,964 --> 00:10:53,298
I want you...
to have... something.

112
00:10:53,369 --> 00:10:56,770
My most prized possession.

113
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:00,639
[Sighs] Oh, it's
a piece of st-string.

114
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:05,272
Not just any string.
The string.

115
00:11:05,348 --> 00:11:10,718
I found it
my first day in America.

116
00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:14,085
- What's with the string?
- It's been in my pocket for 60 years.

117
00:11:14,156 --> 00:11:17,614
Here! I want you two
to share it.

118
00:11:17,693 --> 00:11:21,561
Maybe it'll bring you
closer together.

119
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,191
- You haven't talked much lately.
- Yeah. [Grunts]

120
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,930
- Ah! What are you doing?
- I'm breaking it in half.

121
00:11:29,004 --> 00:11:31,996
- No! I want you to share it.
- No?

122
00:11:32,074 --> 00:11:35,100
- Forever.
- Sure, Pop, sure.

123
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:37,771
Here, uh, you carry it the first
50 years, I'll take it the next.

124
00:11:37,847 --> 00:11:41,078
- Sure.
- And, uh, turn up
the morphine drip a little.

125
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,311
I heard that.

126
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:50,317
Promise me...
that you will never sell...

127
00:11:50,393 --> 00:11:53,658

00:11:53,729 --> 00:11:56,857
to one of those
big conglomerates.

Keep it between you.

131
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,908
- Promise.
- I promise, Pop.

132
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,742
- [Lars's Voice] I promise.
- So, you were sayin'?

133
00:12:11,947 --> 00:12:13,881
I'll have to pass.

134
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:15,974
What?

135
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,884
"A world without string
is chaos."

136
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,186
For once the Smuntz name
was worth something!

137
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,197
- No, no! Don't!
- Oh!

138
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:33,531
You... You used
to love string!

139
00:12:33,602 --> 00:12:35,593
That was before,
when I was dating...

the son of a wealthy
string magnate!

141
00:12:38,073 --> 00:12:40,974
Not now, when I am married
to the half-owner...

142
00:12:41,043 --> 00:12:43,136
of a worthless
deathtrap!

143
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:49,139
I thought you'd be happy!
I stood up for myself today!

144
00:12:49,218 --> 00:12:51,345
April, I've got new ideas
for the factory.

145
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,547
You know,
I've got big plans!

146
00:12:53,622 --> 00:12:57,718
Don't you see, Lars?
That's all you've ever had are plans.

147
00:12:57,793 --> 00:13:02,594
But my life is passing me by,
and l... I need more!

148
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:07,568
There's no air in the middle class,
Lars. I can't breathe here.

149
00:13:07,636 --> 00:13:10,537
- Please, April, don't go.
- [Sighs]

150
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:12,574
I'm not going anywhere.

151
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,824
In a few brief moments, the joy
of the holidays was shattered...

152
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,489
and the world changed
for many people.

153
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:40,501
Mayor McKrinkle died
this afternoon at 4:30 p.m.,
at Our Lady of Sorrows Hospital.

154
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,629
Doctors here say
the official cause of death is...

155
00:13:43,706 --> 00:13:47,472
heart failure due to
the mayor's recent culinary disaster.

156
00:13:47,543 --> 00:13:50,307
And once the hottest restaurant
on the wharf, Chez Ernie...

157
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:54,179
has been condemned
and scheduled for demolition.

158
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,310
I-I don't think I ordered
my cheese sandwich with capers.

159
00:13:57,386 --> 00:14:00,446
- We go live to Leslie Reinhart
for an update.
- I'm sorry.

160
00:14:00,523 --> 00:14:03,583
If there is a villain
in this tragedy, it is Ernie Smuntz.

161
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:06,423
- Once the whiz kid of the
local restaurant scene...
- Ernie, you're on TV again!

162
00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:09,089
What? Oh.

163
00:14:09,164 --> 00:14:11,598
You know what this is?
I'll tell ya.

164
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:14,329
- Guilt by accusation.
- No capers.

165
00:14:14,403 --> 00:14:17,702
No capers? But that's just
grilled cheese. What's the point?

166
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,037
Why don't they eat
out of a trough?

167
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:24,375
Which one of you palateless
sheep sent my sandwich back?

168
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,380
Hi, Ernie!

169
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,679
- Lars?
- [Sighs]

170
00:14:29,752 --> 00:14:31,845
[Ernie]
When I'm in the kitchen, I cook.

171
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:35,254
I can't control every
single thing that goes on in there.

172
00:14:35,324 --> 00:14:38,418
[Lars] You know, it really
isn't fair for everybody to blame you.

173
00:14:38,494 --> 00:14:43,761
- You didn't do anything wrong.
- Yes, but society always needs
someone to persecute.

174
00:14:43,832 --> 00:14:48,360
A scapegoat, someone to demonize.
The same thing happened to Galileo.

175
00:14:48,437 --> 00:14:51,406
Really?
That's unbelievable.

176
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,771
With a cockroach
and everything?

177
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:58,211
No. The point is, I put
everything I had into that restaurant.

178
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,748
It was my livelihood
and my home.

179
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:04,115
In one fatal bite,
it was all taken away from me.

180
00:15:04,186 --> 00:15:06,313
If only we could sell
the factory.

181
00:15:06,388 --> 00:15:08,879
Uh... I'd let you stay with me,
you know, but, uh,

182
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,927
April threw me out.

183
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:16,055
- Oh, that's too bad.
- Yeah, well, don't worry
about me, though, Ernie.

184
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:19,066
Th-This is temporary. April's been
like this since high school.

185
00:15:19,134 --> 00:15:22,399
- She'll be back. L...
- Would you look at them?

186
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:26,430
Sleeping in the street.
Pitiful.

187
00:15:28,444 --> 00:15:31,242
If I had a house,
I'd sleep in it!

188
00:15:31,313 --> 00:15:36,774
- Ernie, do you remember
how close we were as kids?
- No.

189
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:40,481
Hey!
Merry Christmas!

190
00:15:40,556 --> 00:15:42,683
Yeah, I was
on top once too.

191
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:47,695
But there's only one way to go from
there, and that's down, baby, down!

192
00:15:47,763 --> 00:15:50,357
- Oh, ho!
- [Coins Clattering]

193
00:15:50,432 --> 00:15:52,366
Ernie.

194
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:56,461
Ernie! Ernie, there was
a quarter in there.

195
00:15:56,538 --> 00:16:01,373
- (music) Christmas Eve will find me (music)
- A quarter? You think so small, Lars.

196
00:16:01,443 --> 00:16:06,312
Look at the bigger picture.
You have no home, you have
no wife, you have no money.

197
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:10,182
You have no discernible talents.
How can you ignore that?

198
00:16:10,252 --> 00:16:14,416
- (music) I'll be home for Christmas (music)
- Ernie, it's Christmas.

199
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:18,153
Instead of dwelling on
what we don't have, we should
be thankful for what we do have.

200
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:24,962
(music) If only in my dreams (music)(music)

201
00:16:25,034 --> 00:16:26,968
[Woman]
That was very good.

202
00:17:12,147 --> 00:17:14,342
[Ernie]
What a dump.

203
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:17,351
[Creaking]

204
00:17:23,192 --> 00:17:26,958
Wow! I can't believe Pops never
told us about this house.

205
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,788
It's huge.

206
00:17:30,866 --> 00:17:33,562
[Ernie] This is just the kind
of house I'd expect him to have.

207
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:36,661
It's just like him.
Cold and spooky.

208
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,874
[Rustling]

209
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:45,175
- Wow! Did you feel that?
- What?

210
00:17:45,247 --> 00:17:48,580
I got a chill. You shouldn't
talk about Pop like that.

211
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,483
Really?
What's this do for you?

212
00:17:51,553 --> 00:17:56,388
Thanks for nothing,
you string-sucking old loon!

213
00:17:59,027 --> 00:18:01,461
He didn't mean it, Pop.

214
00:18:03,732 --> 00:18:06,166
Ernie! Ernie!

215
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:17,540
Only one bed.
I'll flip you for it.

216
00:18:19,782 --> 00:18:22,046
Heads.

217
00:18:22,117 --> 00:18:24,051
[Ringing]

218
00:18:40,302 --> 00:18:42,497
- [Scratching]
- E-Ernie?

219
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:48,006
- Ernie. Ernie.
- [Groaning]

220
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:51,045
- You asleep?
- I was.

221
00:18:51,113 --> 00:18:54,241
- [Scratching Continues]
- How can you sleep through that?

222
00:18:54,316 --> 00:18:57,683
- What? I don't hear anything.
- Shh-shh-shh-shh. That.

223
00:18:57,753 --> 00:19:01,382
Listen. Hear it?
It's coming from upstairs.

224
00:19:01,456 --> 00:19:04,550
[Scratching Continues]

225
00:19:05,994 --> 00:19:07,928
[Creaking]

226
00:19:22,144 --> 00:19:24,339
Mothballs.

227
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,641
[Screaming]

228
00:19:28,717 --> 00:19:32,016
He-Hey, stop it!
Hey! Ow!

229
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,021
[Grunting]

230
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,523
[Whispering]
Ernie! Ernie!

[Groaning]

232
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,036
[Exhales]

233
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:52,039
[Rattling]

234
00:19:53,475 --> 00:19:55,409
[Grunts]

235
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,794
- [Thunderclap]
- [Screaming]

236
00:20:23,438 --> 00:20:25,565
Wait. Wait a minute.
Stop. Stop!

237
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:29,634
Look. Look, look, look.
It's only a toy.

238
00:20:29,711 --> 00:20:32,805
[Panting]

239
00:20:34,449 --> 00:20:36,883
[Screaming]

240
00:20:36,952 --> 00:20:39,580
Ah, shut up!

241
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:43,622
[Scratching]

242
00:20:45,694 --> 00:20:47,889
It's coming
from up there!

243
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:54,399
- One, two, three!
- [Grunting]

244
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,938
Ooh!
[Panting]

245
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,502
- It's just a mouse.
- What?

246
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,708
It's just a mouse.
Never mind.

247
00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:11,617
- [Grunting, Groaning]
- Hey, there are some posters up here.

248
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:16,454
Oh!
Stand still!

249
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,459
- [Smashing]
- Ah!

250
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:24,522
[Screaming]

251
00:21:26,468 --> 00:21:28,493
[Spitting]

252
00:21:29,604 --> 00:21:32,402
- They're blueprints.
- Wow!

253
00:21:32,474 --> 00:21:36,069
Wait a minute.
Look at this date. 1876.

254
00:21:36,144 --> 00:21:39,875
A centennial house could actually
be worth something.

255
00:21:39,948 --> 00:21:42,644
Look, this must be the architect.
Here, look.

256
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:46,119
"Charles Lyle LaRue."

257
00:21:47,456 --> 00:21:49,754
Charles Lyle Larue.

258
00:21:49,825 --> 00:21:52,760
Charles Lyle LaRue?

259
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,455
[Thumps]

260
00:21:56,531 --> 00:21:59,329
Charles Lyle LaRue.

261
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,736
Charles Lyle LaRue!

262
00:22:04,806 --> 00:22:07,866
Charles Lyle LaRue!

263
00:22:07,943 --> 00:22:12,971
I'm actually standing
in the missing LaRue!

264
00:22:13,048 --> 00:22:16,779
- It's bold yet subtle.
- Classical yet nontraditional.

265
00:22:16,852 --> 00:22:19,082
The missing LaRue.

266
00:22:19,154 --> 00:22:23,250
The rumored design completed shortly
before his committal is a rumor no more.

267
00:22:23,325 --> 00:22:25,259
Before his committal?

268
00:22:25,327 --> 00:22:27,261
[Chuckles] Well, I'm just glad
he finished the place...

269
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:29,559
before they carted him off
to the laughing academy.

270
00:22:29,631 --> 00:22:32,623
[Guffaws]

271
00:22:32,701 --> 00:22:37,365
So, what do you think a magnificent
edifice like this is worth?

272
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,498
Properly restored,
of course.

273
00:22:39,574 --> 00:22:43,374
Well, his Parma Charnel
House went for six...

274
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:47,279
But that was ten years ago, and it
didn't have this exquisite molding.

275
00:22:47,349 --> 00:22:49,681
I see. I can't get enough
of good molding.

276
00:22:52,587 --> 00:22:56,353
- Did you hear that? $600,000.
- [Exhales] Ernie.

277
00:22:56,425 --> 00:22:58,723
Alexander Falko!

278
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,728
Back!

279
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,356
Gentlemen,
congratulations.

280
00:23:03,432 --> 00:23:07,630
Congratulations on your find.
I'm a great admirer of LaRue.

281
00:23:07,702 --> 00:23:11,968
- Glass of rainwater, please.
- Yes, Mr. Falko is the world's
leading collector of LaRues.

282
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:16,374
- Ah.
- Sort of like collecting stamps,
but they're bigger, right?

283
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:21,041
I'll get to the point. LaRue.
I have his books. I have his letters.

284
00:23:21,116 --> 00:23:23,243
You see these shoes?

285
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,809
- [Together] LaRues?
- No, but I'm sure
he would have loved them.

286
00:23:25,887 --> 00:23:29,653
Vegetarian snack. I own...
[Chewing]

287
00:23:29,724 --> 00:23:33,820
Forty-two LaRue houses. Forty-two.
I want to make it 43.

288
00:23:33,895 --> 00:23:36,125
You tell me how
I'm going to do this.

289
00:23:36,198 --> 00:23:39,690
Tell me how I will do this.
You help me. How will I do this?

290
00:23:39,768 --> 00:23:41,702
Well, I'm, uh,
glad you asked.

291
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:44,238
His, uh, Parma Charnel House
went for six,

292
00:23:44,306 --> 00:23:47,503
but that was ten years ago,
and it didn't have this molding.

293
00:23:47,576 --> 00:23:50,602
A find like this in today's market
is worth twice as much.

294
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,206
- He's a LaRue connoisseur.
- Guilty as charged.

295
00:23:54,282 --> 00:23:57,410
Gentlemen, I'm going
to make you an offer.

296
00:23:57,486 --> 00:24:01,013
No, no, no, no, no, I couldn't possibly
be so crass as to allow you to do that.

297
00:24:01,089 --> 00:24:03,785
But you are welcome
to come to the auction.

298
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,793
- Auction?
- Auction?
- Auction, yes.

299
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:10,525
It would be grossly unfair of us
to deprive others of the chance
to bid on the missing LaRue.

300
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:13,067
Um...

301
00:24:13,135 --> 00:24:16,332
May I have just one moment
with my brother, please?

302
00:24:16,404 --> 00:24:18,565
- Sure. Of course.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

303
00:24:20,142 --> 00:24:22,133
- What is this?
- It's the first...

304
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,940
- What is this? No. No.
- It's the first I've heard of...

305
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:30,840
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?
I'm answering your prayers.

306
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:32,853
These pigeons are ripe
for the plucking.

307
00:24:32,921 --> 00:24:35,185
Put them in a room together.
Try and outbid each other?

308
00:24:35,257 --> 00:24:39,091
- We can make $700,000, $800,000 easy.
- [Sighs] Oh, man, smart!

309
00:24:39,161 --> 00:24:41,254
- [Bangs]
- Ooh!

310
00:24:41,329 --> 00:24:43,729
- You're going to get this one. You...
- Don't talk to me! Shh!

311
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:46,995
Um, um, so, when is the, uh,
earliest we can set the auction?

312
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:51,300
Well, I suppose all arrangements
could be completed within the week.

313
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:53,307
- A week it is.
- Great!

314
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:57,641
- You're smarter than you look.
- [Together] Thank you.

315
00:24:58,713 --> 00:25:00,647
But know this.

316
00:25:00,715 --> 00:25:05,118
I have never paid more than $10 million
for a house in my life!

317
00:25:19,534 --> 00:25:21,627
Okay, see you then.

318
00:25:21,703 --> 00:25:24,399
Yeah.
Thanks for stopping by.

Ten million
linen napkins.

321

Five million bales
of top-grade cotton fiber.

322
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:41,647
Forty thousand hot lamps complete
with rotating plate-warming trays.

323
00:25:41,723 --> 00:25:45,591
Two thousand twine threaders,
gleaming under real lights.

- [Feet Pattering]
- [Ernie] My own chain
of five-star gourmet restaurants.

00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:52,599
[Lars, Echoing] April can have
anything she's ever wanted!

326
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:56,364
[Lars] Cars, coats, china.
She loves china.

[Fan Blades Whooshing]

328
00:25:58,673 --> 00:26:00,868
[Ernie] I'm gonna build
an Olympic-sized swimming pool...

329
00:26:00,942 --> 00:26:03,877
and fill it with pina coladas
and a college sorority.

330
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,978
[Lars] If only Pop were here
to see this house!

331
00:26:11,052 --> 00:26:14,078
He did. He just wasn't
smart enough to sell it.

332
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:17,215
Lars, we've turned a corner.
Our future is staring us in the face.

333
00:26:17,292 --> 00:26:23,060
All we have to do is grab it,
baste it, and scarf it down!

334
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,574
Aha! We've finally found
our friend's home!

335
00:26:35,644 --> 00:26:38,340
Well, I bought
a little present for ya, buddy.

336
00:26:38,413 --> 00:26:43,612
Ernie, i-it's just a little mouse.
Do we really have to kill it?

337
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:47,553
Yes. Listen to me.
A single vermin can bring you down.

338
00:26:47,622 --> 00:26:50,853
Believe me, I know.
[Snapping] Ah!

339
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,966
[Snoring]

340
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,140
[Snoring]

341
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:26,150
- [Snapping]
- [Gasping]

342
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:28,855
[Sighs]

343
00:27:36,438 --> 00:27:41,273
- I trust you slept well.
- Oh! Like a baby.

344
00:27:41,343 --> 00:27:43,607
[Sniffs, Grunts]

345
00:27:49,818 --> 00:27:52,582
Hey, last night, did you
happen to hear the, uh...

346
00:27:52,654 --> 00:27:56,488
- Oh, yeah. Let's see.
- Yeah.

347
00:28:03,998 --> 00:28:07,798
- Well, where'd he go?
- I don't know.
Maybe it snapped by itself.

348
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:12,129
I don't believe it.

349
00:28:12,207 --> 00:28:17,975
He snapped the trap, ate the olive,
and left the pit just to mock us.

350
00:28:18,046 --> 00:28:20,344
I think you're giving him
a little too much credit.

351
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:25,377
Mice don't mock. They don't have
a sense of humor or irony.

352
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:28,684
He's not sitting in his hole in
a smoking jacket sipping cognac,

353
00:28:28,757 --> 00:28:31,783
and giggling to himself,
"I left the pit."

354
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:35,125
The trap snapped itself,
the olive flew off, and he ate it.

355
00:28:35,196 --> 00:28:39,724
It's that simple. But now that
he knows we're here, he won't
come within a mile of us.

356
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,996
I don't think we'll be seeing
any more of that... Mouse!

357
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,231
[Both Shrieking]

358
00:28:45,573 --> 00:28:48,007
Aha! Ow!

00:28:48,076 --> 00:28:50,203
[Screams]

360
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:53,145
What are you doing,
ya stupid nitwit?

361
00:28:55,216 --> 00:28:57,150
Don't! Give me that!
Don't let him get away!

362
00:29:00,121 --> 00:29:03,579
[Panting] Yeah!
[Laughs]

363
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,393
Aah-ha-ha!

364
00:29:07,462 --> 00:29:09,828
Y-aah!

00:29:09,898 --> 00:29:13,595

367
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,661
Ow!

368
00:29:20,975 --> 00:29:22,909
Ow!

369
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,246
Are you trying
to kill me?

370
00:29:30,151 --> 00:29:33,780
- [Lars] Ah, the mouse!
- [Ernie Grunting]

371
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,255
[Ernie]
Let me see. Let me see!

372
00:29:36,324 --> 00:29:38,258
Can you see him?

373
00:29:39,727 --> 00:29:42,457
Get me my Gouda.

374
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:49,197
- Careful, careful!
- Don't. Don't touch me. You'll snap it.

375
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,363
- You're not doin' it right.
- Please, let me concentrate, will you?

376
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:54,169
- [Lars] Put it on carefully.
- [Ernie] I'm putting it
on carefully. I'm not...

377
00:29:54,242 --> 00:29:57,268
[Ernie]
Oh, relax. It's cheese.

378
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,614
Bon appetit.

379
00:30:00,682 --> 00:30:02,616
[Claps Hands]

380
00:30:02,684 --> 00:30:05,915
[Sighs]
That takes care of that. Huh?

381
00:30:10,124 --> 00:30:12,058
[Hammering]

382
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:21,067
- Oh!
- Oh!

383
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:30,403
Hey!

384
00:30:30,478 --> 00:30:32,503
Hey!
What are you doin'?

385
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,582
[Squeaking]

386

[Squeaking]

388
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:53,315
Lars!
Gimme a hand with this.

389
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,758
[Lars] Are you sure this tub
fits in with the rest of the house?

390
00:33:01,829 --> 00:33:04,696
Jacuzzi tub, Lars.
It's a Jacuzzi tub.

391
00:33:04,766 --> 00:33:07,200
And this isn't just
a house. It's a LaRue.

392
00:33:07,268 --> 00:33:09,236
Of course it fits
in with the decor.

393
00:33:09,303 --> 00:33:12,500
- Luxury is timeless.
- How much, Ernie?

394
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:15,667
[Sighs]
It was a steal at $1,200.

395
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,711
[Lars]
Twelve hundred dollars?

396
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:20,270
You spent
our last money on a tub!

397
00:33:20,348 --> 00:33:22,282
[Ernie]
A Jacuzzi tub!

398
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,511
You have to spend money
to make money.

399
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:27,679
And they threw in the cardboard lady
just to sweeten the deal.

400
00:33:30,224 --> 00:33:32,488
[Screaming]

401
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:36,321

- [Sighing]
- Well...

406
00:34:17,672 --> 00:34:21,472
[Lars Sighing]
Don't you think this is a little much?

407
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:25,638
Never underestimate
your opponent.

408
00:34:25,713 --> 00:34:31,310
Let's say he has mastered a way to empty
a mousetrap without getting caught.

409
00:34:31,385 --> 00:34:33,819
If he snaps
one of these babies,

410
00:34:33,888 --> 00:34:37,119
a chain reaction will
start snapping them all.

411
00:34:37,191 --> 00:34:40,490
He'll panic, and the law of averages
says one of them has to nab him.

412
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,522
[Sighs]
Not bad.

413
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:48,330
Yes. Well, I like
to use both sides of my brain.

414
00:34:48,402 --> 00:34:50,336
Come on.
Let's hit the sack. [Grunts]

415

[Sighing]

418
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,037
- Have you figured it out yet?
- Shut up.

419
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:33,410
I'm thinking.
I'm thinking!

420
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,661
Ernie. Ernie!

421
00:35:53,334 --> 00:35:58,135
Keep perfectly still.
This is it.

422
00:36:16,991 --> 00:36:19,357
- What's he doing?
- I dunno.

423
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,040
That was good.

424
00:36:54,929 --> 00:36:56,863
Shh! He's goin'
for the cherries!

425
00:37:00,868 --> 00:37:02,733
I thought you said
mice like Gouda.

426
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:06,000
Not in the morning! Cheese tires
them out. They need fruit for energy.

427
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,073
[Screaming]

428

There he goes!

- Oh...

- Whoa! Uh! I felt something.

Ooh, ooh, ooh.

445
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,668
Keep sucking!

- Yeah. Dead animals always do.

this'll get him!

[Squirting]

454
00:39:35,689 --> 00:39:39,056
- What's this?
- We're foreclosing on your house.

455
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:41,094
You've quit paying
your mortgage.

456
00:39:41,162 --> 00:39:45,997
Oh, wait a minute. I think there's been
some mistake. This house is paid for.

457
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:48,467
No, it was paid for,
but you borrowed against it.

458
00:39:48,536 --> 00:39:51,994
If you don't pay the $1,200 overdue,
we repossess it.

459
00:39:52,073 --> 00:39:55,907
- Twelve hundred dollars?
- Well, how long do we have?

460
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:00,144
One week from, uh,
five days ago.

461
00:40:00,214 --> 00:40:04,674
[Panting] But, uh,
that's two days!

462
00:40:04,752 --> 00:40:07,744
We don't have the time or energy
to deal with these petty problems now.

463
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,052
We're in the midst of
an extensive renovation.

464
00:40:10,124 --> 00:40:13,355
Looks like you're off
to a great start.

465
00:40:14,895 --> 00:40:17,022
You could ask your boss
at Rimpy's for an advance.

466
00:40:17,098 --> 00:40:19,032
- You can pay him back after the auction.
- Couldn't you ask...

467
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,591
your workers to forfeit
their salaries for a few weeks?

468
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,603
You are the boss.

469
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:27,072
If you hadn't spent all our
money on that tub, we might be
able to pay the mortgage.

470
00:40:27,141 --> 00:40:30,542
- It doesn't help to start crying now.
- [Shrieking]

471
00:40:30,611 --> 00:40:33,512
No, Fluffy! No!

472
00:40:33,581 --> 00:40:36,379
No! I want my kitty!

473
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:40,944
No, no, no!

- That one's cute.

00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:59,571
- He doesn't have that killer instinct.

Morning, gentlemen. I'm Maury.
Anything I can help you with?

481
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:23,886
Uh, hi, Maury.
W-We need a cat.

482
00:41:23,964 --> 00:41:26,990
- [Cats Yowling]
- Find the one you want,

483
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:30,093
and I'll spay
or neuter it myself.

484
00:41:30,171 --> 00:41:32,969
Well, these
are all kittens.

485
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,703
We were hoping for an older cat.
One with experience.

486
00:41:36,777 --> 00:41:39,371
That's a switch. Most people
like the cute little ones.

487
00:41:39,446 --> 00:41:41,471
- Experience with what?
- Mouse hunting.

488
00:41:41,549 --> 00:41:44,916
- Oh, all cats are good mousers.
- Yes, but you see, we have huge rats...

489
00:41:44,985 --> 00:41:47,146
the size of sumo wrestlers,
and lots of them.

490
00:41:47,221 --> 00:41:52,158
So, we really need a ferocious
feline, preferably with
a history of mental illness.

491
00:41:52,226 --> 00:41:54,421
I'm talkin'...
one mean pussy.

492
00:41:54,495 --> 00:41:57,623
Yeah! A vicious cat,
difficult to love.

493
00:41:57,698 --> 00:42:00,599
Do you have any of those
knocking around your cages?

494
00:42:00,668 --> 00:42:05,833
Funny you should ask. I had all but
given up on anyone wanting him.

495
00:42:05,906 --> 00:42:09,137
We were about
to gas him again.

496
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:11,269
- Again?
- Again?

497
00:42:11,345 --> 00:42:14,872
He's spent most of his whole life
in that box, I expect.

498
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,816
- [Growling]
- "Catzilla"?

499
00:42:17,885 --> 00:42:19,978
The guys who clean up
call him that.

500
00:42:20,054 --> 00:42:23,046
But, uh, you can call him
anything you want.

501
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:25,387
I'd say he looks
like a "Fluffy."

502
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:28,189
[Snarling]

503
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:33,628
Ah, poor little
Catzilla.

504
00:42:33,701 --> 00:42:37,637
You want a home, don't you?
You wanna get out of here.

505
00:42:37,705 --> 00:42:40,640
Well, you're gonna have
to kill, kill, kill for it.

506
00:42:40,708 --> 00:42:42,903
- [Yowling]
- You're a stupid cat, aren't you?

507
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:45,912
- [Growling]
- [Chuckles]
Yes, you are. And you're ugly.

508
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,744
- Extremely ugly!
- [Yowling]

509
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,807
[Electricity Crackling]

510
00:42:50,884 --> 00:42:56,584
- Oh! Oh, you little bastard.
- We'll take him.

511
00:42:58,626 --> 00:43:00,685
- [Grunting]
- [Cat Screeching]

512
00:43:00,761 --> 00:43:02,752
Here, boy.

513
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,764
[Growling]

514
00:43:08,302 --> 00:43:10,236
[Squeaking]

515
00:43:10,304 --> 00:43:12,602
[Yowling]

516
00:43:15,075 --> 00:43:17,009
Ooh... He's got
the scent now.

517
00:43:17,077 --> 00:43:19,011
Yeah, uh,
go get 'im, boy.

518
00:43:21,615 --> 00:43:24,209
Oh, easy, easy,
easy, easy!

519
00:43:24,285 --> 00:43:26,219
- [Smashing]
- Oh!

520
00:43:32,059 --> 00:43:36,428
Wow. I almost feel sorry
for the little fella.

521
00:43:36,497 --> 00:43:39,398
[Together] Almost!
[Laughing]

522
00:43:40,801 --> 00:43:42,735
[Growling]

523
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:08,951
[Growling]

524
00:44:09,029 --> 00:44:10,963
[Roaring]

525
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,835
[Meowing]

526
00:44:34,521 --> 00:44:36,955
[Notes Playing]

527
00:44:41,862 --> 00:44:43,796
[Cat Yowling]

528
00:44:46,166 --> 00:44:48,157
It's time to stop
worrying about that mouse...

529
00:44:48,235 --> 00:44:51,068
and start thinking about how
we're going to locate $1,200.

530
00:44:51,138 --> 00:44:54,266
Don't worry, Ernie.
The workers will help us out.

531
00:44:54,341 --> 00:44:59,779
[Panting] You see, the truth is,
we don't actually have any money.

532
00:44:59,847 --> 00:45:02,509
Aww!

533
00:45:10,891 --> 00:45:14,725
We may have to defer
your next paycheck or-or two.

534
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:18,458
- [Moaning, Shouting]
- So my brother and I can pay
the mortgage on the house.

535
00:45:18,532 --> 00:45:20,466
It's the missing LaRue!

536
00:45:20,534 --> 00:45:23,128
[Lars] I mean, there's no need
for violence, you know.

537
00:45:25,906 --> 00:45:27,840
[Lars]
Put that thing down. Whoa!

538
00:45:38,385 --> 00:45:40,319
[Banging]

539
00:45:49,062 --> 00:45:51,895
Ernie!
[Panting]

540
00:45:51,965 --> 00:45:54,365
- What's the matter?
- Well, the, uh, the workers.

541
00:45:54,435 --> 00:45:57,336
They didn't react
as positively as I had hoped.

542
00:45:57,404 --> 00:46:00,202
[Shouting]

543
00:46:00,274 --> 00:46:04,074
No? Uh, what
are you doing?

544
00:46:04,144 --> 00:46:07,841
- Uh, you could fit through
this window, right?
- What? Wh... I guess so.

545
00:46:07,915 --> 00:46:10,008
Come on.
[Screaming]

546
00:46:12,286 --> 00:46:14,618
Aah!

547
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:17,987
Oh, but, Lars,
that was our last resort!

548
00:46:18,058 --> 00:46:20,288
Well, we're gonna have to
find the money someplace else.

549
00:46:38,479 --> 00:46:42,210
Gosh, it's a shame nobody's interested
in buying the factory.

550
00:46:42,282 --> 00:46:44,546
Yeah, yeah,
it's a shame.

551
00:46:44,618 --> 00:46:46,779
But who'd be stupid enough
to buy the factory, right?

552
00:46:46,854 --> 00:46:49,482
[Chuckling]
Yeah.

553
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,829
[Growling]

554
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,020

[Surprised Meowing]

00:48:09,369 --> 00:48:11,997
[Sad Meowing]

559
00:48:33,727 --> 00:48:37,493
Ah, you must be
Caesar.

560
00:48:37,564 --> 00:48:40,158
Well, Mr. Caesar, uh, glad you could
get here so quickly...

561
00:48:40,233 --> 00:48:42,167
Shh!

562
00:48:56,984 --> 00:48:59,111
[Tapping Echoes]

563
00:49:08,128 --> 00:49:10,062
[Sniffing]

564
00:49:13,667 --> 00:49:15,635
You have mice.

565
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:18,604
He's good.

566
00:49:18,672 --> 00:49:21,539
[Whispering]
5120 Nortondale.

567
00:49:21,608 --> 00:49:24,634
January 4. 0800 hours.

568
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:26,804
Don't forget to get
toothpaste and Saran Wrap.

569
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,907
We're in sort of a hurry. Uh, I just
want to warn you about this mouse.

570
00:49:30,984 --> 00:49:35,182
[Shouting]
Yeah. You got asbestos, all right.

571
00:49:35,255 --> 00:49:37,553
I'll bet it's up
in the ceiling, mostly.

572
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:43,853
Shouldn't take me more
than a day or two to remove it.

573
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:46,922
[Mouthing Words]

574
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,700
[Shouting] Okay, then.
Um, uh, so, we're gonna go upstairs.

575
00:49:52,773 --> 00:49:55,139
[Shouting]
All right, well, we'll all go upstairs.

576
00:49:55,208 --> 00:49:58,541
- Yeah.
- [Stomping]

577
00:49:58,612 --> 00:50:01,046
Okay, then.
Yeah.

578
00:50:05,852 --> 00:50:07,945
What are you doing?

579
00:50:09,156 --> 00:50:12,751
- He's not listening anymore.
- Oh.

580
00:50:12,826 --> 00:50:15,192
Good. Well,
you're the expert.

581
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,594
I just hope you can take care
of this, whatever it takes.

582
00:50:17,664 --> 00:50:21,122
We've been trying to catch
this little menace all week.

583
00:50:21,201 --> 00:50:23,135
Here's your problem.

584
00:50:23,203 --> 00:50:25,467
Normal people are not...

585
00:50:25,539 --> 00:50:28,997
psychologically equipped
to catch mice.

586
00:50:29,076 --> 00:50:32,568
You have to get
inside their mind.

587
00:50:32,646 --> 00:50:35,706
You have to know what
they want... need.

588
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:38,683
You have to think
like a mouse.

589
00:50:38,752 --> 00:50:42,279
If you can do that...
if you can think like a mouse...

590
00:50:42,355 --> 00:50:45,222
you can anticipate
their moves.

591
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:49,490
Then, boom!
Sayonara, mouse.

592
00:50:49,563 --> 00:50:53,055
- [Sighs]
- Well, got some great stuff...

593
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:57,194
- Whoa! Never touch that!
- [Screaming] Whoa! Ah!

594
00:50:57,270 --> 00:51:00,205
- All right!
- What is it?

595
00:51:02,876 --> 00:51:06,175
- [Panting] The big one.
- It's a flea bomb!

596
00:51:06,246 --> 00:51:09,409
Works on mice too.

597
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:13,214
Yeah? Well, it better. Because
we can't handle any more intrusions.

598
00:51:13,286 --> 00:51:17,052
Sure. That's how
you perceive it.

599
00:51:17,124 --> 00:51:20,150
But to that mouse,

600
00:51:20,227 --> 00:51:22,889
you are the intruder.

601
00:51:24,131 --> 00:51:26,065
[Shouting]

602
00:51:34,608 --> 00:51:37,736
If we work fast, we can make
enough string to meet our orders.

603
00:51:37,811 --> 00:51:40,075
That's the spirit. Just a few cases,
so we can keep the LaRue.

604
00:51:40,147 --> 00:51:42,479
- Good luck.
- Wait! Where are you going?

605
00:51:42,549 --> 00:51:44,483
- Aren't you gonna help?
- I have to run a little errand.

606
00:51:44,551 --> 00:51:47,452
All you have to do is make $1,200 worth.
How long can that take?

607
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:49,580
Light a match.
They're frightened by fire.

608
00:51:49,656 --> 00:51:51,590
[Shouting]

609
00:51:54,394 --> 00:51:56,453
[Grunting, Groaning]

610
00:53:35,095 --> 00:53:37,029
[Screams]

611
00:53:56,016 --> 00:53:57,950
Unsanitary creature.

612
00:54:00,253 --> 00:54:04,246
Defecating
in the dining room.

613
00:54:08,228 --> 00:54:11,197
0915. Evidence found.

614
00:54:15,135 --> 00:54:19,003
Mus communis.
Ugh. Male.

615
00:54:23,443 --> 00:54:28,278
Ten to, uh, twelve
centimeters long,

616
00:54:30,383 --> 00:54:33,477
with a... hmm...

617
00:54:36,156 --> 00:54:38,090
What's this?

618
00:54:38,158 --> 00:54:40,251
A slight calcium
deficiency.

619
00:54:40,327 --> 00:54:42,261
That's interesting.

620
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:52,598
Uh, hi. This is Ernest Smuntz
of Smuntz String.

621
00:54:52,672 --> 00:54:55,163
Is this the business representative
for Zeppco International?

622
00:54:55,241 --> 00:54:59,177
Vinny? Hi, Vinny. Oh, I'm glad
I can call you Vinny.

623
00:54:59,245 --> 00:55:03,341
Uh, my brother and I have decided
to reconsider your generous offer.

624
00:55:03,416 --> 00:55:06,214
I'd love to discuss
selling our factory to you.

625
00:55:06,286 --> 00:55:11,656
Oh, no, not at the office.
How about Ellman Square
under the big clock at noon?

626
00:56:19,159 --> 00:56:22,094
[Horn Honking]

627
00:56:22,162 --> 00:56:25,256
- [Thud]
- [Chiming]

628
00:56:37,277 --> 00:56:41,475
Uh, you, you must be
Mrs. Lars Smuntz?

629
00:56:41,548 --> 00:56:46,451
- I'm afraid that status
is in transition.
- Oh, well, is Lars in?

630
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:51,479
- I'd like to discuss
preparations for the auction.
- The auction?

631
00:56:57,964 --> 00:57:00,626
[Panting]

632
00:57:07,407 --> 00:57:10,205
Careful, Lars.
You might catch a cold.

633
00:57:11,978 --> 00:57:14,503
April!

634
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:18,913
You look like you could use
some warming up.

635
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:30,091
1300 hours. I've activated
the Squeak Seeker 2000.

636
00:57:30,163 --> 00:57:32,461
I'm about to join
with the prey.

637
00:57:48,948 --> 00:57:52,850
I'm experiencing malfunction
with the plasma screen. Stand by.

638
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:05,163
Junk.

639
00:58:14,841 --> 00:58:17,674
Nothing works.

640
00:58:53,813 --> 00:58:55,804
Ah, nuts!

641
00:58:56,749 --> 00:58:59,081
[Yelling]

642
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:07,218
[Continues Yelling]

643
00:59:41,394 --> 00:59:45,330
EKG, a C-spine, a chest X ray
and pelvis. Now move!

644
00:59:45,398 --> 00:59:49,334
- Twelve hundred dollars.
- Lie still, Mr. Smuntz.
You've just been hit by a bus.

645
00:59:49,402 --> 00:59:52,132
I feel fine.
What time is it?

646
00:59:52,205 --> 00:59:54,833
You may have had a concussion.
We're gonna do a series of X rays.

647
00:59:54,907 --> 00:59:58,707
You don't understand, Doc.
I have to get out of here.
I might still have a chance.

648
00:59:58,778 --> 01:00:01,008
We saved your hat.

649
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,571
- I'm sorry. Are you family?
- Yes, we are sisters.

650
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:06,619
Great. There's some paperwork
I need for you to fill out.
Is he an organ donor?

651
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,745
Don't let them fill anything
out. I don't even know them.

652
01:00:08,821 --> 01:00:12,018
Oh, I'm Hilde,
and this is Ingrid.

653
01:00:12,091 --> 01:00:15,788
- We are hair models from Belgium.
- Belgian hair models. How exotic.

654
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:20,629
Listen to me, Doc. I need to
find a phone before I miss out
on the deal of my life.

655
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,692
- I think your brother's
a little delirious.
- I am not their brother!

656
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:27,763
- I don't have any sisters!
- Ernie, are you okay?
I came as soon as I heard.

657
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,274
Why are you wearing
a pink overcoat?

658
01:00:31,844 --> 01:00:35,143
Because April gave us
the twelve hundred dollars!

659
01:00:39,452 --> 01:00:43,183
She gave you the money? You don't think
she heard about the auction?

660
01:00:43,256 --> 01:00:48,250
No. I didn't even tell her about the

661
01:00:48,328 --> 01:00:53,630
She just showed up at the factory, took
off her coat and begged me to take her.

[Sighs] We made love in a way
I've only ever seen in nature films.

Wow. I almost
can't believe it.

664
01:01:00,673 --> 01:01:04,234
I'll be able to open up another
restaurant, you're back with April,

665
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:07,643
and you'll even be able to keep
that worthless factory.

You know it's funny that
you call the factory worthless,

probably should have mentioned before...

I have something to confess too.

- Caesar! What happened?

671
01:01:38,344 --> 01:01:41,905
- Please, sir. He's not well.
- Try to think. Did you kill the mouse?

01:01:41,981 --> 01:01:44,347
What's that? Horse?

We could hear screaming
in the background.

678
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:03,261
He was locked in a trunk
in the attic.

to make himself a sandwich.

[Ernie]
Pickles, arugula and capers.

691
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:24,577
He toasted the side
with the cheese...

692
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:29,212
but not the other side,
so the arugula doesn't wilt.

We do not appreciate
being treated this way,

I have to check on my crepes.

825
01:15:37,516 --> 01:15:41,247
Keep the champagne coming, boys. The
more they drink, the higher they bid.

826
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:44,619
Hey, you boys put on
quite a shindig here, huh?

- Thank you so much, Mr. Falko.

You know, it would be
very, very sad...

829
01:16:02,274 --> 01:16:05,801
if you boys put on this auction
and nobody bid.

830
01:16:05,877 --> 01:16:09,313
That would put a real crimp
in our evening, but...

831
01:16:09,381 --> 01:16:11,440
I don't think there's
any danger of that happening.

832

of Eurotrash out there
scarfin' up the shrimps.

but ultimately rewarding.

the bidding at $1 million?

01:31:45,383 --> 01:31:47,715
The entire factory
has been retrofitted...

989
01:31:47,785 --> 01:31:50,845
to facilitate the manufacturing
of cheese-based products.

990
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:55,689
- I see.
- And over here we're developing
our new lactose-free line.

991
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:57,921
- What is that?
- Oh, that's quality control.

992
01:31:59,430 --> 01:32:01,364
Here you go.
Knock yourself out.

993
01:32:02,934 --> 01:32:06,426
Oh. No good, huh?
Otis, more curry.

994
01:32:06,504 --> 01:32:08,438
Okay. Try this one.

995
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:13,232
Huh? It's mozzarella
and herring.

996
01:32:13,311 --> 01:32:15,245
You can taste
the herring, right?

997
01:32:15,313 --> 01:32:18,305
I've also got a great idea
for a caviar-brie swirl,

998
01:32:18,382 --> 01:32:20,816
and a peanut butter and jelly
provolone for the kids.

999
01:32:20,885 --> 01:32:23,718
But what I really want to talk to you
about is expansion and marketing.

1000
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:25,722
I think you should be
our spokesperson.

1001
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:30,124
I know some people who've used
a mouse as a spokesperson,
and it seemed to work out well.

1002
01:32:30,194 --> 01:32:35,894
You see, I want to turn this
into the string cheese factory
of tomorrow today...

1003
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,894
