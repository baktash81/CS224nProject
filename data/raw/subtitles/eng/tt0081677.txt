00:00:24,982 --> 00:00:28,652
♫ Everyone vouching trying to get there

3
00:00:28,652 --> 00:00:31,756
♫ Taking the hard road, got to be so cool

4
00:00:31,756 --> 00:00:35,638
♫ Knocking myself out,
you've got to watch out

5
00:00:35,638 --> 00:00:39,240
♫ You can't turn away

6
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,555
♫ Using my knowhow if only I can now

7
00:00:42,555 --> 00:00:45,774
♫ Stepping much faster
to get what I'm after

8
00:00:45,774 --> 00:00:49,462
♫ Moving around town, shaking it on down

9
00:00:49,462 --> 00:00:52,629
♫ Time and time again

10
00:00:55,311 --> 00:00:58,464
♫ How do I get there spinning my number

11
00:00:58,464 --> 00:01:01,915
♫ You're taking over spinning for so long

12
00:01:01,915 --> 00:01:04,017
♫ A piece of the action

13
00:01:04,017 --> 00:01:05,914
♫ You've got what they're asking

14
00:01:05,914 --> 00:01:09,164
♫ Turn across your day

15
00:01:11,355 --> 00:01:14,375
♫ Maybe a cupcake driving you insane

16
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:18,223
♫ When you affix them,
you know who you are

17
00:01:18,223 --> 00:01:21,951
♫ Nobody's caring, everyone's sharing

18
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:24,701
♫ You're the one

19
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:34,060
♫ Might will turn you upside down

20
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,288
♫ You must keep moving

21
00:01:36,288 --> 00:01:40,205
♫ Take the best of all you get

22
00:01:43,717 --> 00:01:45,411
♫ Paving the way, paving the way

23
00:01:45,411 --> 00:01:47,077
♫ Show me the way, show me the way

24
00:01:47,077 --> 00:01:51,244
♫ I know it's time to settle down

25
00:01:52,198 --> 00:01:54,438
♫ I must keep moving

26
00:01:54,438 --> 00:01:58,625
♫ All I want is just right now

27
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,028
♫ Paving the way, paving the way

28
00:02:00,028 --> 00:02:01,619
♫ Holding me back, holding me back

29
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,786
♫ Making a path, making
a path, making a path

30
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,022
♫ This is the good life

00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,527
♫ How do I get there

40
00:02:44,527 --> 00:02:47,810
♫ Spending my number,
you're making your plan

41
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,758
- Coming up on eight in the
a.m. here at South Bay's

42
00:02:50,758 --> 00:02:51,925
very own WSGA.

43
00:02:53,613 --> 00:02:55,250
Bill Hoyt with you hoping it's gonna be

44
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,072
just another perfect day, sun, surf,

45
00:02:58,072 --> 00:03:01,242
whatever it takes to
make you feel just right.

46
00:03:01,242 --> 00:03:02,908
Time for all you windsurfers out there

47
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:06,384
to roll out of those
racks and into the sea.

48
00:03:06,384 --> 00:03:08,307
There's just two days left to get in shape

49
00:03:08,307 --> 00:03:11,064
for the South Bay Centennial
Regatta on Saturday.

50
00:03:11,064 --> 00:03:13,488
Of course we all know that
our own local surf sailor,

51
00:03:13,488 --> 00:03:16,214
Mike Patterson's pretty sure
that he's got that trophy

52
00:03:16,214 --> 00:03:17,233
wrapped up.

53
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:19,797
And, just to make sure, he's
been putting in eight hours

54
00:03:19,797 --> 00:03:22,592
a day for the last couple of weeks.

55
00:03:22,592 --> 00:03:24,274
- Where'd you get input Hoyt?

56
00:03:24,274 --> 00:03:27,241
Mike's just about sleeping
on his board these days.

57
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:28,853
- Of course, Billy Joe Wells figures

58
00:03:28,853 --> 00:03:30,550
he's got a chance too.

59
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,258
Don't you Billy Joe?

60
00:03:32,258 --> 00:03:33,913
- Here we go again.

61
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:37,138
Cub reporter's gotta have
his morning shot at dad.

62
00:03:37,138 --> 00:03:42,092
- Well who knows maybe his
daddy will buy that trophy.

63
00:03:42,092 --> 00:03:45,123
Oh Billy Joe, that's now
way to talk to a pal.

64
00:03:45,123 --> 00:03:47,636
I'll tell you what I'll play
a record for you anyway.

65
00:03:47,636 --> 00:03:49,665
I was gonna play it to
Mike, but I don't think

66
00:03:49,665 --> 00:03:50,915
he can hear it.

67
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,279
(slapping)

68
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,297
- Good morning to you too.

69
00:04:09,558 --> 00:04:13,058
- I thought you were coming to pick me up.

70
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:23,944
I see Mike's early as usual.

71
00:04:23,944 --> 00:04:25,987
- He's been out almost an hour already.

72
00:04:25,987 --> 00:04:28,654
(R and B music)

73
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:36,684
- He's really out to win, huh?

74
00:04:36,684 --> 00:04:37,761
- He will too.

75
00:04:37,761 --> 00:04:39,652
There's nobody around
here who can touch him

76
00:04:39,652 --> 00:04:41,260
unless he gets careless.

77
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,593
He'll have to forget to put his flag up

78
00:04:42,593 --> 00:04:44,083
to lose that cup.

79
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,393
- WSGA wants to remind one and all

80
00:04:46,393 --> 00:04:49,195
that Saturday marks the
beginning of the Centennial Week

81
00:04:49,195 --> 00:04:50,028
festivities.

82
00:04:50,028 --> 00:04:52,343
After the wind surfing
event, committee chairman

83
00:04:52,343 --> 00:04:54,636
William Wells senior
has graciously provided

84
00:04:54,636 --> 00:04:57,815
the grounds of the state
for an open house barbecue.

85
00:04:57,815 --> 00:05:00,119
Now I'm sure that now one will think

86
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:02,618
for a moment that Mr. Wells generosity

87
00:05:02,618 --> 00:05:04,238
has anything to do with the fact

88
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:07,856
that he's running for governor
in the November elections.

89
00:05:07,856 --> 00:05:09,661
- What's he got against my old man?

90
00:05:09,661 --> 00:05:11,320
- Makes no difference, Billy Joe.

91
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,789
WSGA listeners don't vote anyways,

92
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:15,622
and your dad knows it.

93
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:08,164
(tense music)

94
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:19,616
(splashing)

95
00:06:19,616 --> 00:06:22,116
(tense music)

96
00:06:28,783 --> 00:06:30,283
(yelling)

97
00:06:30,283 --> 00:06:32,783
(tense music)

98
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:33,056
(orchestral music)

99
00:07:45,392 --> 00:07:48,559
(typewriter clacking)

100
00:07:57,499 --> 00:08:00,416
(orchestral music)

101
00:08:05,538 --> 00:08:07,647
- [Gloria] Hi honey.

102
00:08:07,647 --> 00:08:09,766
I assume it was a flash of literary genius

103
00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:13,933
that kept you from making
the coffee while I was out.

104
00:08:17,453 --> 00:08:20,120
- Some flash of literary genius.

105
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,930
I'd have probably made just as bad coffee.

106
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:29,916
How's the ocean this morning?

107
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,999
- Now there's a little chop but nice.

108
00:08:37,214 --> 00:08:38,047
Where's Jenny?

109
00:08:38,047 --> 00:08:39,347
Still asleep?

110
00:08:39,347 --> 00:08:41,648
- No, she left just after you did.

111
00:08:41,648 --> 00:08:45,152
She's gone surfing with the boys.

112
00:08:45,152 --> 00:08:47,563
- Oh by the way, you haven't
forgotten the committee

113
00:08:47,563 --> 00:08:48,961
meeting have you?

114
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:51,960
I promised you'd be there with me today.

115
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,793
- Oh yeah.

116
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:56,374
Okay.

117
00:08:57,613 --> 00:08:59,904
I guess I've used up all
the excuses I can think of.

118
00:08:59,904 --> 00:09:01,655
- Yes, you have.

119
00:09:01,655 --> 00:09:02,488
- Daddy?

120
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,480
Daddy, we need your help.

121
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,421
- Why, what's the matter?

122
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,026
- Mike, he disappeared.

123
00:09:08,026 --> 00:09:09,007
- Disappeared, what do you mean?

124
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,428
- He was out surfing about 200 yards out

125
00:09:11,428 --> 00:09:13,417
when all of sudden, we
didn't see him anymore.

126
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:14,462
- We were watching him.

127
00:09:14,462 --> 00:09:15,915
It looked like he was doing fine,

128
00:09:15,915 --> 00:09:17,220
and then like Jenny said, he was gone.

129
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,811
No sign of him or anything.

130
00:09:18,811 --> 00:09:20,894
- We need your boat, dad.

131
00:09:40,303 --> 00:09:43,221
- Okay I'll see you guys inside.

132
00:09:43,221 --> 00:09:44,419
Peter didn't show, huh?

133
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:45,889
That doesn't surprise me.

134
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:48,348
- He has his own reasons, Ned.

135
00:09:48,348 --> 00:09:49,253
- I bet.

136
00:09:49,253 --> 00:09:51,182
The artist can't be
bothered with little things

137
00:09:51,182 --> 00:09:53,682
like his hometown celebration.

138
00:09:54,717 --> 00:09:57,353
- He doesn't owe you any explanations

139
00:09:57,353 --> 00:09:58,770
and neither do I.

140
00:10:00,386 --> 00:10:01,507
- [Man In Gray Jacket]
Excuse me, Mr. Rosen.

141
00:10:01,507 --> 00:10:02,340
- Later.

142
00:10:06,877 --> 00:10:09,627
(dramatic music)

143
00:10:56,254 --> 00:10:57,087
- Peter!

144
00:11:05,982 --> 00:11:06,863
- Hey John.

145
00:11:06,863 --> 00:11:08,076
- Hello Mrs. Benton.

146
00:11:08,076 --> 00:11:10,130
What a pleasure to see you here.

147
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,130
Do you Georgie Ferguson.

148
00:11:13,445 --> 00:11:15,607
- You've got to keep
everyone under control.

149
00:11:15,607 --> 00:11:19,177
This is an opportunity you
can't afford to screw up.

150
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:21,435
- [Gloria] Good morning, Mr. Wells.

151
00:11:21,435 --> 00:11:23,435
- Gloira, where's Peter?

152
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:27,219
- He couldn't come.

153
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,040
- I thought you said
he'd be joining us today.

154
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,064
- Yes, I know.

155
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,808
- You know temperamental
writers, Mr. Wells.

156
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:35,333
They're excused from every responsibility.

157
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,734
You can't interrupt inspiration.

158
00:11:37,734 --> 00:11:40,813
- Gloria, we're depending
on Peter to help us

159
00:11:40,813 --> 00:11:41,911
with the regatta.

160
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:44,142
- Of course, I know and so does Peter.

161
00:11:44,142 --> 00:11:47,975
But, we had a bit of a
problem this morning.

162
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:49,004
- A problem?

163
00:11:49,004 --> 00:11:50,034
What kind of problem?

164
00:11:50,034 --> 00:11:51,010
- One of Jenny's--

165
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,525
- Mr. Wells, Washington
on the phone for you.

166
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:56,207
- Okay you guys, move ahead.

167
00:11:56,207 --> 00:11:58,253
Slow, that's good.

168
00:11:58,253 --> 00:12:00,162
Follow the hats.

169
00:12:00,162 --> 00:12:01,086
Jim, okay good.

170
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:01,947
- [Jim] You want me to hold?

171
00:12:01,947 --> 00:12:06,723
- No, we stay on them, we
lead them, and end up here,

172
00:12:06,723 --> 00:12:09,262
and zoom in for a tight
shot on the big man.

173
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:13,497
Oh Mr. Wells, we're laying
out the shooting schedule.

174
00:12:13,497 --> 00:12:16,283
- Fine, when do I get to see it?

175
00:12:16,283 --> 00:12:18,731
- Would tomorrow morning be convenient?

176
00:12:18,731 --> 00:12:21,462
- I need it in about a
half an hour in my office.

177
00:12:21,462 --> 00:12:22,376
- Half an hour?

178
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:23,281
Sorry, Mr. Wells--

179
00:12:23,281 --> 00:12:25,448
- Bob, I'm relying on you.

180
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:42,102
- One thing's for sure, it
wasn't a floating chainsaw.

181
00:12:42,102 --> 00:12:45,393
I've lived here 30 years,
never been a reported

182
00:12:45,393 --> 00:12:47,028
shark sighting of anything big enough

183
00:12:47,028 --> 00:12:49,086
to have done this since I've been here.

184
00:12:49,086 --> 00:12:51,753
(ominous music)

185
00:12:53,186 --> 00:12:56,400
It had to be one hell of a specimen too.

186
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,346
- Well the trouble is
once they get a free meal,

187
00:12:58,346 --> 00:13:02,132
once they get a taste,
they tend to hang around

188
00:13:02,132 --> 00:13:03,709
looking for more.

189
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:06,376
(ominous music)

190
00:13:08,862 --> 00:13:11,347
- Well there's still a missing
half of Mike's surf board.

191
00:13:11,347 --> 00:13:15,064
Maybe Mike's on it
drifting around out there.

192
00:13:15,064 --> 00:13:16,154
- Maybe.

193
00:13:16,154 --> 00:13:18,821
(ominous music)

194
00:13:20,975 --> 00:13:21,808
- Jesus.

195
00:13:23,685 --> 00:13:24,589
- What?

196
00:13:24,589 --> 00:13:27,579
- They got a wind surf
regatta on Saturday.

197
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:29,496
- I wouldn't bet on it.

198
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,475
(ominous music)

199
00:13:33,475 --> 00:13:35,740
I'll radio in the Coast Guard,

200
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,761
have 'em start the search for the boy.

201
00:13:37,761 --> 00:13:38,594
- Okay.

202
00:13:38,594 --> 00:13:41,261
(ominous music)

203
00:13:44,373 --> 00:13:46,540
(banging)

204
00:13:53,182 --> 00:13:55,563
- Oh darn it, Dave.

205
00:13:55,563 --> 00:13:56,921
I'm a boat.

206
00:13:56,921 --> 00:13:59,588
(ominous music)

207
00:14:15,016 --> 00:14:16,169
What's wrong with you guys?

208
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:18,420
You almost scrapped my side off.

209
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,753
- Sorry kiddo, just didn't
want you drifting out

210
00:14:20,753 --> 00:14:22,253
to sea that's all.

211
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:26,089
(dramatic music)

212
00:14:30,647 --> 00:14:32,521
- What makes you so sure it's a shark,

213
00:14:32,521 --> 00:14:33,645
could've been a prop, couldn't it?

214
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:35,712
- Come on Bill, look at that board.

215
00:14:35,712 --> 00:14:37,832
You seriously think a
propeller made those cuts?

216
00:14:37,832 --> 00:14:40,729
- Yes, but how do we know
this was Mike's board.

217
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:44,757
Could've drifted up from
Florida probably or anywhere.

218
00:14:44,757 --> 00:14:46,094
I don't buy it.

219
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:47,058
- Come on Matt.

220
00:14:47,058 --> 00:14:48,666
It's not a question of
buying it or not buying it.

221
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:49,946
There's a kid missing.

222
00:14:49,946 --> 00:14:51,166
That's all that matters.

223
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,165
Coast Guard's already out looking.

224
00:14:53,165 --> 00:14:54,496
Ed Glover's out there on patrol.

225
00:14:54,496 --> 00:14:58,118
Maybe he's come up with something.

226
00:14:58,118 --> 00:15:00,181
- This is where we found the surf board.

227
00:15:00,181 --> 00:15:02,377
The current here runs
off toward Eagle Rock.

228
00:15:02,377 --> 00:15:03,623
Mike would know that.

229
00:15:03,623 --> 00:15:06,550
He'd be smart enough not
to try and swim against it.

230
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,419
Coast Guard's out there
looking for him now.

231
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:10,922
So with any luck.

232
00:15:10,922 --> 00:15:13,102
(phone ringing)

233
00:15:13,102 --> 00:15:13,935
Excuse me.

234
00:15:15,126 --> 00:15:17,873
(phone ringing)

235
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:18,777
Hello?

236
00:15:18,777 --> 00:15:20,560
- What if he's been hurt?

237
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,744
What about the boat that
ran across the board?

238
00:15:22,744 --> 00:15:25,077
Why didn't they pick him up?

239
00:15:30,191 --> 00:15:31,326
- That was Jenny.

240
00:15:31,326 --> 00:15:33,147
The Coast Guard radioed in.

241
00:15:33,147 --> 00:15:34,897
They found something.

242
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:15,992
- Look at the way it's listing.

243
00:16:15,992 --> 00:16:17,478
It's a wonder it didn't sink.

244
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:19,254
- Maybe they have some news about Mike.

245
00:16:19,254 --> 00:16:21,392
- I don't seen anyone onboard.

246
00:16:21,392 --> 00:16:22,693
- There's something fishy here.

247
00:16:22,693 --> 00:16:24,026
I don't like it.

248
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,592
- Hi.

249
00:16:41,592 --> 00:16:44,342
- They just got here this moment.

250
00:16:52,785 --> 00:16:53,618
- Chris.

251
00:16:54,497 --> 00:16:55,468
Whose boat's that?

252
00:16:55,468 --> 00:16:56,635
- Ed Glover's.

253
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,809
- John, what happened?

254
00:17:02,192 --> 00:17:03,475
- Found it swamped.

255
00:17:03,475 --> 00:17:05,826
Must've gone up on the
rocks out near Eagle.

256
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:07,733
- [Peter] Where's Ed?

257
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:09,424
- There was nobody on the boat.

258
00:17:09,424 --> 00:17:12,174
(dramatic music)

259
00:17:19,595 --> 00:17:22,007
- Ed Glover's the last sailor around here

260
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:24,909
who would get himself caught
in Eagle Rock current.

261
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:27,659
- Unless he got caught in a haze.

262
00:17:30,335 --> 00:17:33,098
- That's Ed Glover's boat.

263
00:17:33,098 --> 00:17:35,397
- [John] All set, chief.

264
00:17:35,397 --> 00:17:38,147
(dramatic music)

265
00:17:44,996 --> 00:17:46,554
- Well Peter, I suppose
you're gonna tell me

266
00:17:46,554 --> 00:17:48,501
your shark did this too.

267
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,276
- I'm not here to tell you anything, Matt.

268
00:17:50,276 --> 00:17:53,564
Two people disappearing
in one day bothers me.

269
00:17:53,564 --> 00:17:56,045
- [John] Chief, chief, chief.

270
00:17:56,045 --> 00:17:58,795
(dramatic music)

271
00:18:09,966 --> 00:18:11,534
- [Bill] Good God.

272
00:18:11,534 --> 00:18:14,620
- You better start thinking
about that regatta, Bill.

273
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,406
- Couldn't have been something else?

274
00:18:16,406 --> 00:18:18,206
Couldn't it have been an explosion?

275
00:18:18,206 --> 00:18:20,175
I'm sure we all know that
when Ed goes fishing,

276
00:18:20,175 --> 00:18:21,223
he uses grenades.

277
00:18:21,223 --> 00:18:23,629
- Don't know what you're talking about.

278
00:18:23,629 --> 00:18:25,450
No explosion did this.

279
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,228
You see any powder marks here?

280
00:18:27,228 --> 00:18:28,131
Look at it!

281
00:18:28,131 --> 00:18:31,072
Look at it and tell me a grenade did this.

282
00:18:31,072 --> 00:18:33,528
- I don't care what did it.

283
00:18:33,528 --> 00:18:36,152
I've never been known to quit.

284
00:18:36,152 --> 00:18:38,819
South Bay's having it's regatta.

285
00:18:39,984 --> 00:18:41,218
You can't do it, Bill.

286
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:42,051
- I can't?

287
00:18:42,051 --> 00:18:43,007
Of course I can.

288
00:18:43,007 --> 00:18:43,913
In fact I have to.

289
00:18:43,913 --> 00:18:46,447
There's too much at stake now.

290
00:18:46,447 --> 00:18:48,779
(ominous music)

291
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:49,612
- Peter!

292
00:18:50,932 --> 00:18:51,765
Look!

293
00:18:52,897 --> 00:18:55,564
(ominous music)

294
00:18:58,442 --> 00:19:01,346
- That would be the other
half of Mike's surf board.

295
00:19:01,346 --> 00:19:03,256
Anymore doubts?

296
00:19:03,256 --> 00:19:05,339
(crying)

297
00:19:08,501 --> 00:19:10,569
- No damn shark's gonna
screw up a whole year's work

298
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:11,652
and planning.

299
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,150
We're going ahead with the
regatta, and there won't be

300
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:15,983
any risks.

301
00:19:23,015 --> 00:19:24,432
It wasn't a mako.

302
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,840
It wasn't a tiger.

303
00:19:27,735 --> 00:19:29,492
There's only one shark in this whole world

304
00:19:29,492 --> 00:19:33,325
big enough to have caused
that kind of damage.

305
00:19:46,035 --> 00:19:49,035
(metallic clanging)

306
00:19:51,141 --> 00:19:54,155
- Gentlemen, there is absolutely no need

307
00:19:54,155 --> 00:19:56,978
for you to worry about me
allowing anything to happen

308
00:19:56,978 --> 00:19:58,521
to my town.

309
00:19:58,521 --> 00:20:00,735
More than ample security
measures have been taken

310
00:20:00,735 --> 00:20:03,386
to protect the wind surfers.

311
00:20:03,386 --> 00:20:07,375
This section of the bay has
been completely closed off

312
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,242
by special shark proof
netting which extends

313
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,742
from here to here.

314
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:18,074
Spotters will be placed
along these strategic points.

315
00:20:18,074 --> 00:20:19,804
And, boats with our men aboard

316
00:20:19,804 --> 00:20:23,182
will be anchored outside
the netting here, here,

317
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:24,015
and here.

318
00:20:25,486 --> 00:20:28,353
So the actual triangle
in which the regatta

319
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:31,270
takes place will be 100% safe.

320
00:20:32,905 --> 00:20:36,988
Gentlemen, absolutely
nothing is going to happen.

321
00:20:39,349 --> 00:20:40,392
- You like it?

322
00:20:40,392 --> 00:20:41,876
- Yeah.

323
00:20:41,876 --> 00:20:43,450
Cover as much as you can.

324
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,952
When you're through,
you'll have enough material

325
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,757
to put together a pretty good documentary

326
00:20:46,757 --> 00:20:49,424
on Wells' water sports security.

327
00:20:50,594 --> 00:20:54,353
By the way, I don't want
people getting the wrong idea.

328
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,688
I'm not saying they
will, but just in case,

329
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,612
don't air that stuff till I give the word.

330
00:20:59,612 --> 00:21:01,439
Right now we have to keep the lid on it.

331
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:03,465
Or, we'll have a lot more on
our hands than a rogue shark

332
00:21:03,465 --> 00:21:04,509
to worry about.

333
00:21:04,509 --> 00:21:06,119
- Hey wait a minute.

334
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,619
People will panic.

335
00:21:10,111 --> 00:21:13,445
- Yeah we have to avoid that at all costs.

336
00:21:13,445 --> 00:21:14,381
Is that clear?

337
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:15,491
- Yeah it's clear.

338
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:18,527
It puts me in a rather
precarious position.

339
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,357
What do I tell the station?

340
00:21:20,357 --> 00:21:21,190
- Nothing.

341
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,866
Don't worry, I'll take care of you.

342
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,550
- Mr. Wells.

343
00:21:40,853 --> 00:21:44,270
- How many boats do you think we'll need?

344
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:50,343
- I'd say about eight including yours.

345
00:21:50,343 --> 00:21:51,962
- Well we better make it 10.

346
00:21:51,962 --> 00:21:55,285
My office has instructions
to give you whatever you need

347
00:21:55,285 --> 00:21:56,241
just call.

348
00:21:56,241 --> 00:21:58,195
- That's very nice, but
there's only one thing

349
00:21:58,195 --> 00:22:00,529
that I'd be needing.

350
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:01,362
- Name it.

351
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:06,363
- The head of the great white,
Mr. Wells, just the head.

352
00:22:09,645 --> 00:22:12,395
(dramatic music)

353
00:22:16,595 --> 00:22:17,762
Just the head.

354
00:22:22,956 --> 00:22:26,373
- Great white shark, affectionately known

355
00:22:27,565 --> 00:22:30,690
in the tropics as white death.

356
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,673
That's what we're dealing with here.

357
00:22:32,673 --> 00:22:33,958
There's nothing else that could've caused

358
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:36,404
the kind of damage we've seen.

359
00:22:36,404 --> 00:22:38,631
Now I know the great white isn't supposed

360
00:22:38,631 --> 00:22:41,664
to be in our waters
here, but maybe it's old

361
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:45,414
or crazed or for some
reason it can't compete

362
00:22:46,723 --> 00:22:49,218
for the food where it normally feeds.

363
00:22:49,218 --> 00:22:52,276
Whatever the reason here it is.

364
00:22:52,276 --> 00:22:56,276
Well the record length
is a little over 28 feet,

365
00:22:58,523 --> 00:23:01,440
and the only vulnerable points are,

366
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:07,800
hell Ron, come on you do this, will you?

367
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:14,139
- All right his weak points
are the base of the head,

368
00:23:16,322 --> 00:23:18,601
and below the dorsal.

369
00:23:18,601 --> 00:23:21,665
You have to aim for one or the other

370
00:23:21,665 --> 00:23:25,582
of the two areas because
the great white shark,

371
00:23:27,056 --> 00:23:29,137
you cannot scare off.

372
00:23:29,137 --> 00:23:33,209
Not this animal especially
because he's had

373
00:23:33,209 --> 00:23:36,876
his taste of human
flesh, and he's developed

374
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:40,409
a craving kind of madness.

375
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:46,217
Because it's not his hunger
that he wants to satisfy.

376
00:23:48,857 --> 00:23:50,274
He wants to kill.

377
00:23:54,221 --> 00:23:55,113
So you have two choices.

378
00:23:55,113 --> 00:23:57,113
One, get out of his way.

379
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:02,707
The other

380
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,727
is to hold your ground, and
fire, and try to kill him

381
00:24:14,338 --> 00:24:18,054
because you do not have another choice.

382
00:24:18,054 --> 00:24:19,221
Any questions?

383
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:24,393
(ominous music)

384
00:24:26,443 --> 00:24:28,943
(funky music)

385
00:25:25,338 --> 00:25:28,005
(ominous music)

386
00:25:31,003 --> 00:25:32,248
- I'm going for a swim.

387
00:25:32,248 --> 00:25:33,534
Who's coming?

388
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:36,201
(ominous music)

389
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:19,616
(banging)

390
00:26:19,616 --> 00:26:22,283
(ominous music)

391
00:26:28,155 --> 00:26:30,195
(banging)

392
00:26:30,195 --> 00:26:32,862
(ominous music)

393
00:26:36,984 --> 00:26:39,151
(banging)

394
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,727
(ominous music)

395
00:27:03,267 --> 00:27:06,009
(banging)

396
00:27:06,009 --> 00:27:08,676
(ominous music)

397
00:27:23,078 --> 00:27:25,411
(splashing)

398
00:27:28,062 --> 00:27:30,562
(tense music)

399
00:27:59,214 --> 00:28:01,881
(ominous music)

400
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:09,024
- [Man With Long Hair] Dave
came in second in his last race.

401
00:28:09,024 --> 00:28:10,004
He's got a good chance

402
00:28:10,004 --> 00:28:11,316
- [Man With Short Hair] So does Billy Joe.

403
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:13,816
Come on let's go in the water.

404
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:28,984
- [Man] Hey Jenny get some
light stuff from the car.

405
00:28:28,984 --> 00:28:30,576
No, no, not that one.

406
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:32,743
The one with snoopy on it.

407
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,147
(folk music)

408
00:28:39,639 --> 00:28:43,084
♫ Oh little Caroline,
I'm feeling so lonely

409
00:28:43,084 --> 00:28:47,321
♫ I see that the sun is going down

410
00:28:47,321 --> 00:28:50,728
♫ Oh little Caroline
riding across the prairie

411
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:55,284
♫ Please be waiting
there when I ride to town

412
00:28:55,284 --> 00:28:56,948
♫ I'll bring you butterflies

413
00:28:56,948 --> 00:28:59,158
♫ I'll make your morning coffee

414
00:28:59,158 --> 00:29:02,873
♫ All you gotta say is you'll be mine

415
00:29:02,873 --> 00:29:04,659
♫ I'll build you a little home

416
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,967
♫ Where we can love each other

417
00:29:06,967 --> 00:29:10,373
♫ We'll live together
till the end of the time

418
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:14,391
♫ I can't believe it's you sweet Caroline

419
00:29:14,391 --> 00:29:18,612
♫ I hope that someday
soon you'll be all mine

420
00:29:18,612 --> 00:29:22,232
♫ As I sit here by my flag
and feel a warm desire

421
00:29:22,232 --> 00:29:26,236
♫ Tonight I dream of you my Caroline

422
00:29:26,236 --> 00:29:28,653
(folk music)

423
00:29:33,631 --> 00:29:35,331
- [Cheerleaders] One, two, three, four.

424
00:29:35,331 --> 00:29:37,664
W, E, L, L, S is number one.

425
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:48,808
(cheering)

426
00:30:03,186 --> 00:30:05,203
- [Reporter] Mr. Wells,
can I ask you a question?

427
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:06,453
- Maybe later.

428
00:30:13,184 --> 00:30:15,448
Gloria, you look lovely today.

429
00:30:15,448 --> 00:30:16,384
- Don't I always?

430
00:30:16,384 --> 00:30:17,632
- Yes of course.

431
00:30:17,632 --> 00:30:19,273
- Glad to see Peter could make it.

432
00:30:19,273 --> 00:30:20,787
- So am I.

433
00:30:20,787 --> 00:30:23,204
(folk music)

434
00:30:33,924 --> 00:30:35,443
- You sure your men know enough to keep

435
00:30:35,443 --> 00:30:37,206
their hardware out of sight?

436
00:30:37,206 --> 00:30:38,765
- Now we've gone over all that one.

437
00:30:38,765 --> 00:30:39,933
They'll just stay out of sight.

438
00:30:39,933 --> 00:30:42,854
- Unless of course they have to use them.

439
00:30:42,854 --> 00:30:43,687
- Fine.

440
00:30:43,687 --> 00:30:44,823
- We'll go ahead with the press conference

441
00:30:44,823 --> 00:30:46,358
whenever you're ready, Mr. Well.

442
00:30:46,358 --> 00:30:49,525
- All right I'll be ready in a minute.

443
00:30:52,265 --> 00:30:53,098
Gentlemen.

444
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:55,902
- [Announcer] Ladies and Gentlemen,

445
00:30:55,902 --> 00:30:58,440
this is the start of the first event

446
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,501
of South Bay's Annual Regatta.

447
00:31:00,501 --> 00:31:03,298
This year coincides with
our town's bicentennial

448
00:31:03,298 --> 00:31:04,639
celebration.

449
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:07,186
It's all sponsored by Mayor Bill Wells

450
00:31:07,186 --> 00:31:11,833
who as everybody knows is
running for state government.

451
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:14,192
- Well get 'em started, Matt,
and keep your fingers crossed.

452
00:31:14,192 --> 00:31:15,587
- Nothing's gonna happen.

453
00:31:15,587 --> 00:31:17,109
- Hope so.

454
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:19,078
- Are you ready?

455
00:31:19,078 --> 00:31:20,219
- [Jenny] Hi Dad.

456
00:31:20,219 --> 00:31:21,136
- Hi kiddo.

457
00:31:23,505 --> 00:31:24,922
You guys all set?

458
00:31:26,668 --> 00:31:28,717
- Going to get a trophy
in the South Bay, are you?

459
00:31:28,717 --> 00:31:29,550
- Hope so.

460
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,392
There's a band load of West Coast jocks

461
00:31:31,392 --> 00:31:32,893
who I guess will give us a run for it.

462
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:34,145
- I think they're wearing those plates

463
00:31:34,145 --> 00:31:35,263
just to scare you guys.

464
00:31:35,263 --> 00:31:38,631
They're probably from up North
Philadelphia or something.

465
00:31:38,631 --> 00:31:40,458
- Hell there ain't nothing
to worry about Jenny.

466
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:42,201
I mean we can stand up
to the best of them.

467
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:43,119
Let's go.

468
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:43,952
So long, Mr. Benton.

469
00:31:43,952 --> 00:31:44,785
- So long.

470
00:31:44,785 --> 00:31:46,047
- Dave, please be careful.

471
00:31:46,047 --> 00:31:47,125
- Come on Jenny.

472
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:49,149
Don't worry, your father and
Mr. Hammer have taken care

473
00:31:49,149 --> 00:31:50,600
of everything.

474
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,183
- [Matt] Competitors
to the starting point.

475
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,410
Get into the water Kids!

476
00:32:04,232 --> 00:32:05,899
Come on hurry it up!

477
00:32:08,656 --> 00:32:11,573
Right up behind the starting point.

478
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:16,899
- Yeah that's right.

479
00:32:16,899 --> 00:32:19,232
Camera three, start rolling.

480
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:23,646
That's good, hold that.

481
00:32:23,646 --> 00:32:26,729
(announcer speaking)

482
00:32:30,642 --> 00:32:32,513
- Don't bunch together.

483
00:32:32,513 --> 00:32:34,852
- Jimmy, get over to the judges platform

484
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:36,062
for a shot of the start.

485
00:32:36,062 --> 00:32:37,829
- All right Bob, on my way.

486
00:32:37,829 --> 00:32:42,456
- [Announcer] They're lining
up behind the starting line.

487
00:32:42,456 --> 00:32:44,858
- Dave's staying pretty far out.

488
00:32:44,858 --> 00:32:46,902
- That's good strategy, kiddo.

489
00:32:46,902 --> 00:32:49,819
He won't have to tack at the start.

490
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,629
- [Matt] One minute.

491
00:32:52,629 --> 00:32:54,502
- [Announcer] Dave Seder's
our local champion.

492
00:32:54,502 --> 00:32:56,987
Let's not forget that Dave
was the East Coast rookie

493
00:32:56,987 --> 00:32:57,820
champion.

494
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,416
- [Bill] I'd like to see that
shark get through those nets.

495
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,788
- You two cost us a pretty penny

496
00:33:01,788 --> 00:33:03,861
with all these particular
measures of yours.

497
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:06,528
(ominous music)

498
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,713

503
00:33:36,171 --> 00:33:37,931
- Come on Dave, go for it.

504
00:33:37,931 --> 00:33:40,558
- [Announcer] Just over
a mile and a half to go.

505
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:43,141
- Oh the pink demon, Billy Joe.

506
00:33:44,067 --> 00:33:46,317

00:34:00,055 --> 00:34:00,888
Come on!

510
00:34:01,802 --> 00:34:03,374

00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,113
are hanging in there.

512
00:34:05,113 --> 00:34:06,780
Now it's Tom Kellog.

513
00:34:10,055 --> 00:34:11,138
- Bank right.

514
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,639

- Let me have the glasses.

521
00:34:39,163 --> 00:34:41,830
- [Jenny] Come on Dave, come on.

522
00:34:43,053 --> 00:34:45,062

523
00:34:45,062 --> 00:34:46,145
Get them out.

00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:52,115

525
00:34:52,115 --> 00:34:54,865
- [Announcer] Here comes another.

526
00:34:56,912 --> 00:35:00,390
- Everyone get out of the water now.

527
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,785
(ominous music)

528
00:35:03,785 --> 00:35:07,285
- What the hell's going on with that buoy?

529
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,773
(cheering)

530
00:35:12,102 --> 00:35:14,435

(ominous music)

532
00:35:18,122 --> 00:35:21,743
- [Bill] What the hell's happening?

533
00:35:21,743 --> 00:35:23,883
- Everybody out of the
water and onto the boat.

534
00:35:23,883 --> 00:35:26,509
Everyone out of the
water and onto the boat.

535
00:35:26,509 --> 00:35:28,847

538
00:35:36,329 --> 00:35:37,184

539
00:35:37,184 --> 00:35:38,751
Everyone out of the water.

540
00:35:38,751 --> 00:35:39,584
- Out of the water.

541
00:35:39,584 --> 00:35:40,417
Hurry it up.

542
00:35:40,417 --> 00:35:42,238
- There's something over there.

543
00:35:42,238 --> 00:35:44,869
- Leave your board and get onto the boat.

544
00:35:44,869 --> 00:35:47,261
Get out of the water now!

545
00:35:47,261 --> 00:35:48,094
- Grab the line.

546
00:35:48,094 --> 00:35:49,882
Get on the boat.

547
00:35:49,882 --> 00:35:52,382
Come on, get on the boat here.

548
00:35:53,589 --> 00:35:56,547
- Wow that's it, fantastic.

549
00:35:56,547 --> 00:35:59,214
(ominous music)

550
00:36:02,033 --> 00:36:04,533
(tense music)

551
00:36:07,855 --> 00:36:10,129
- Get out, Dave, get out!

552
00:36:10,129 --> 00:36:12,296
(yelling)

553
00:36:13,144 --> 00:36:14,136
- Don't panic!

554
00:36:14,136 --> 00:36:16,636
(tense music)

555
00:36:31,133 --> 00:36:32,620
- [Ron] Go on, help the others.

556
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,787
- Don't panic.

557
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:37,394
(yelling)

558
00:36:40,938 --> 00:36:43,716
- [Ron] Leave your board
and get on the boat.

559
00:36:43,716 --> 00:36:46,216
(tense music)

560
00:36:50,493 --> 00:36:52,331
- Don't panic.

561
00:36:52,331 --> 00:36:56,136
Get on the boat or back to the beach.

562
00:36:56,136 --> 00:36:58,636
(tense music)

563
00:37:04,544 --> 00:37:06,526
Get back to the beach.

564
00:37:06,526 --> 00:37:07,598
Hurray up.

565
00:37:07,598 --> 00:37:08,681
Hurray it up!

566
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:13,013
What the...

567
00:37:13,013 --> 00:37:14,866
(splashing)

568
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:17,033
(yelling)

569
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:21,118
- Lovely, come on, zoom in.

570
00:37:21,118 --> 00:37:23,951
(crowd screaming)

571
00:37:30,688 --> 00:37:32,855
(yelling)

572
00:37:39,616 --> 00:37:41,592
- There's no one to blame now.

573
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,041
- [Man In Gray Suit] Mr.
Wells, now do you want to call

574
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:45,785
that shark a rumor?

575
00:37:45,785 --> 00:37:47,535
- I'm sorry gentlemen, I
can't make a statement now.

576
00:37:47,535 --> 00:37:49,374
- But, didn't you take the
proper security precautions.

577
00:37:49,374 --> 00:37:51,033
- Now just hold it there.

578
00:37:51,033 --> 00:37:52,676
I said hold it!

579
00:37:52,676 --> 00:37:55,952
Security measures were taken
but nor for a great white

580
00:37:55,952 --> 00:37:57,244
of this size.

581
00:37:57,244 --> 00:38:00,047
I've never seen anything
like it in my whole life,

582
00:38:00,047 --> 00:38:02,522
and I've hunted shark all over the world.

583
00:38:02,522 --> 00:38:04,269
So put that in your paper.

584
00:38:04,269 --> 00:38:07,602
But, security measures, they were taken.

585
00:38:10,657 --> 00:38:15,206
- [Man In Crowd] The shark,
the shark, it's coming back!

586
00:38:15,206 --> 00:38:17,983
(crowd screaming)

587
00:38:17,983 --> 00:38:20,650
(ominous music)

588
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:25,844
(screaming)

589
00:38:33,871 --> 00:38:36,538
(ominous music)

590
00:39:20,002 --> 00:39:22,896
- Bill, you're the one
who made the decision

591
00:39:22,896 --> 00:39:24,646
to go ahead and race.

592
00:39:26,412 --> 00:39:28,912
Politics is decisions, period.

593
00:39:31,097 --> 00:39:33,662
- Politics is decisions?

594
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:37,085
Paul, suppose we save that
bullshit for the voters.

595
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:40,037
All right, so I made the wrong decision,

596
00:39:40,037 --> 00:39:42,619
but I bent over backwards on security.

597
00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:45,089
Benton and Hamer are the best there is.

598
00:39:45,089 --> 00:39:46,081
- [Paul] But, they're
not running for governor.

599
00:39:46,081 --> 00:39:47,871
- Which means you don't
think I should either, right?

600
00:39:47,871 --> 00:39:50,221
- Look the other side's having a field day

601
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,478
in the press, and we haven't
got much of an answer.

602
00:39:53,478 --> 00:39:54,547
- [Bill] What do you want
me to do go down there

603
00:39:54,547 --> 00:39:56,827
and kill the God damn thing myself?

604
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:59,498
- [Paul] No, but it will
take something spectacular

605
00:39:59,498 --> 00:40:02,903
for me to keep our key people aboard.

606
00:40:02,903 --> 00:40:05,736
- I got a feeling, just a feeling,

607
00:40:06,589 --> 00:40:09,006
that you're passing the buck.

608
00:40:09,923 --> 00:40:13,394
I think you're the one that
wants to back out of this.

609
00:40:13,394 --> 00:40:16,127
- If that's the way
you want to look at it.

610
00:40:16,127 --> 00:40:18,914
Bill, I'm in this to
win, so I want to be sure

611
00:40:18,914 --> 00:40:20,831
I'm backing the winner.

612
00:40:22,498 --> 00:40:24,814
Bottom line is that you've
got to be responsible

613
00:40:24,814 --> 00:40:27,564
for the destruction of that shark

614
00:40:30,988 --> 00:40:33,155
and not by next week, now.

615
00:40:35,296 --> 00:40:36,936
- I've gotten out of worse spots.

616
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:39,239
I'll get out of this one.

617
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:40,156
- I hope so

618
00:40:46,409 --> 00:40:47,576
for your sake.

619
00:40:57,412 --> 00:40:59,829
- Don't worry, we'll make it.

620
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,270
We always have.

621
00:41:18,716 --> 00:41:21,299
- Well I got the dynamite here.

622
00:41:22,292 --> 00:41:24,577
- What are you gonna do
blow yourself up again

623
00:41:24,577 --> 00:41:26,193
like Aruba?

624
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:28,972
- Now wait a minute that was
a bad charge and you know it.

625
00:41:28,972 --> 00:41:31,417
It just went off a
little early that's all.

626
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:34,108
- Put you out of commission for 18 months.

627
00:41:34,108 --> 00:41:35,413
That's your warning
your lungs wouldn't take

628
00:41:35,413 --> 00:41:37,209
any deeper than 30 feet.

629
00:41:37,209 --> 00:41:39,015
Let's talk about the dynamite.

630
00:41:39,015 --> 00:41:41,067
- [Ron] All right let's talk about it.

631
00:41:41,067 --> 00:41:42,448
Just gonna be used as a back up.

632
00:41:42,448 --> 00:41:45,573
You know there's libel to be
a mighty big fish down there,

633
00:41:45,573 --> 00:41:49,070
and then even power heads
wouldn't do the trick.

634
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:52,616
- Okay commander, so long as it's backup.

635
00:41:52,616 --> 00:41:53,772
It could get mighty lonesome down there,

636
00:41:53,772 --> 00:41:56,085
you know you all blown
up into little pieces,

637
00:41:56,085 --> 00:41:58,767
and I'll be staring at that
damn big shark all by myself.

638
00:41:58,767 --> 00:42:00,134
- I thank you for your concern,

639
00:42:00,134 --> 00:42:02,995
but it's just possible
he's nowhere in the area.

640
00:42:02,995 --> 00:42:04,303
- True.

641
00:42:04,303 --> 00:42:07,062
On the other hand, it could
be he's right under the boat.

642
00:42:07,062 --> 00:42:08,426
(laughing)

643
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:10,260
- It could be.

644
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,156
I'll tell you one thing.

645
00:42:12,156 --> 00:42:15,393
He gets a whiff at that blood out there,

646
00:42:15,393 --> 00:42:18,310
he's gonna come around in a hurray.

647
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:22,292
Now Gloria, in the locker
there's some tie ropes

648
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:23,720
and clips.

649
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,465
Now if we need them, we're
gonna need them fast.

650
00:42:26,465 --> 00:42:29,614
- Just say the word, skipper.

651
00:42:29,614 --> 00:42:31,031
- Yeah I hope so.

652
00:42:31,918 --> 00:42:34,297
You know Peter, we're
libel to see something

653
00:42:34,297 --> 00:42:36,738
the size of which we haven't seen before.

654
00:42:36,738 --> 00:42:38,988
It's bound to be dangerous.

655
00:42:39,854 --> 00:42:41,021
- Bound to be.

656
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:44,447
- What if your old man
comes looking for his boat?

657
00:42:44,447 --> 00:42:47,506
- No way he's too busy to go cruising.

658
00:42:47,506 --> 00:42:50,018
Besides when we haul
that monster into port,

659
00:42:50,018 --> 00:42:52,435
he's gonna be one proud papa.

660
00:42:53,701 --> 00:42:56,007
- Local kids avenge friend's death,

661
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:57,507
kill killer shark.

662
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:01,706
I can see it on the network news already.

663
00:43:01,706 --> 00:43:03,842
- And, what if we don't find it?

664
00:43:03,842 --> 00:43:05,755
- You know what I say?

665
00:43:05,755 --> 00:43:08,473
We oughta make a pact not
to come home without it.

666
00:43:08,473 --> 00:43:09,306
- [Dave] I'm in.

667
00:43:09,306 --> 00:43:10,139
- Me too.

668
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:12,203
- Hey.

669
00:43:15,425 --> 00:43:16,695
This is all I could find.

670
00:43:16,695 --> 00:43:18,175
I don't know what he did with Ron.

671
00:43:18,175 --> 00:43:19,290
- You did just fine.

672
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:20,623
- Yeah I'll say.

673
00:43:22,813 --> 00:43:23,646
Let's see.

674
00:43:24,912 --> 00:43:26,011
A 12 gauge.

675
00:43:26,011 --> 00:43:27,563
- Okay you guys, the hunt is on.

676
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:30,563
(mimicking trumpet)

677
00:43:35,007 --> 00:43:37,007
- [Ron] Can you read me?

678
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:39,565
- Yeah I got you fine.

679
00:43:39,565 --> 00:43:40,756
- Me too.

680
00:43:40,756 --> 00:43:43,082
- [Ron] All right now it's just the sonar.

681
00:43:43,082 --> 00:43:44,665
- Okay coming down.

682
00:43:47,722 --> 00:43:50,055
(splashing)

683
00:43:55,623 --> 00:43:58,623
Gloria would you lower this on down?

684
00:44:08,335 --> 00:44:10,668
(splashing)

685
00:44:35,504 --> 00:44:38,921
- [Mr. Olafsen] Back it up, straight out.

686
00:44:44,187 --> 00:44:45,466
- [Tom] Hi Mr. Olafsen.

687
00:44:45,466 --> 00:44:46,681
- Hi Tom.

688
00:44:46,681 --> 00:44:49,389
- We're going out to shoot
some blues off Eagle.

689
00:44:49,389 --> 00:44:51,013
- But, where's your dad?

690
00:44:51,013 --> 00:44:52,773
- He couldn't make it.

691
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,761
- Does he know you're taking his boat?

692
00:44:54,761 --> 00:44:55,664
- Sure does.

693
00:44:55,664 --> 00:44:56,597
He told me I could.

694
00:44:56,597 --> 00:44:57,564
- Okay.

695
00:44:57,564 --> 00:45:00,934
You come back in if the wind
carries off Easterly, you hear?

696
00:45:00,934 --> 00:45:01,767
- You bet.

697
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:04,767
Nothing to worry about, Mr. Olafsen.

698
00:45:08,071 --> 00:45:09,654
- Be careful there.

699
00:45:15,847 --> 00:45:19,544
- Damn I can hardly make the shark out.

700
00:45:19,544 --> 00:45:21,246
- Use some stock footage.

701
00:45:21,246 --> 00:45:22,474
Nobody'd know the difference.

702
00:45:22,474 --> 00:45:25,472
- Hell no, I promised
Harry a network pickup.

703
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:27,096
I've gotta have some action footage.

704
00:45:27,096 --> 00:45:28,509
You might have to dive Jimmy.

705
00:45:28,509 --> 00:45:30,646
- [Jimmy] The things I
do for show business.

706
00:45:30,646 --> 00:45:31,965
- [Bob] Look at that.

707
00:45:31,965 --> 00:45:34,247
I wanna have that baby swim
right across the screen

708
00:45:34,247 --> 00:45:35,476
in living color.

709
00:45:35,476 --> 00:45:36,777
And, if you can get it
to jump through a hoop,

710
00:45:36,777 --> 00:45:38,112
all the better.

711
00:45:38,112 --> 00:45:40,779
(ominous music)

712
00:46:54,238 --> 00:46:56,520
- [Ron] Gloria, ready
to head back to shore.

713
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,270
- Why, what happened?

714
00:47:08,207 --> 00:47:09,820
- [Jenny] Take the pole up to the bow

715
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,653
while I coil the line.

716
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,341
(gun racking)

717
00:47:30,204 --> 00:47:32,871
(ominous music)

718
00:47:53,521 --> 00:47:56,021
(tense music)

719
00:48:09,285 --> 00:48:12,005
(cracking)

720
00:48:12,005 --> 00:48:14,505
(tense music)

721
00:48:20,552 --> 00:48:22,898
(exploding)

722
00:48:22,898 --> 00:48:25,398
(tense music)

723
00:48:31,804 --> 00:48:34,753
(banging)

724
00:48:34,753 --> 00:48:37,253
(tense music)

725
00:48:40,916 --> 00:48:43,083
(banging)

726
00:48:44,898 --> 00:48:47,398
(tense music)

727
00:48:48,961 --> 00:48:51,641
(banging)

728
00:48:51,641 --> 00:48:54,141
(tense music)

729
00:49:02,027 --> 00:49:04,889
(banging)

730
00:49:04,889 --> 00:49:07,389
(tense music)

731
00:49:09,436 --> 00:49:11,603
(banging)

732
00:49:12,804 --> 00:49:15,304
(tense music)

733
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:22,306
(ominous music)

734
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,693
(exploding)

735
00:50:44,097 --> 00:50:46,764
(ominous music)

736
00:50:51,614 --> 00:50:53,864
(bubbling)

737
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,147
(ominous music)

738
00:51:02,701 --> 00:51:06,702
- Peter, you're down
to three minutes, air.

739
00:51:06,702 --> 00:51:07,655
- Okay it's ready.

740
00:51:07,655 --> 00:51:08,822
Throw it over.

741
00:51:16,908 --> 00:51:20,658
- Hey Billy Joe, slow
down to trolling speed!

742
00:51:23,606 --> 00:51:25,939
(breathing)

743
00:51:38,675 --> 00:51:40,175
- Can you hear me?

744
00:51:54,496 --> 00:51:56,829
(splashing)

745
00:52:12,888 --> 00:52:14,765
- Jenny, yell me the spot.

746
00:52:14,765 --> 00:52:16,265
- Are you kidding?

747
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:22,386
(coughing)

748
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:26,729
- Okay, he's all right.

749
00:52:26,729 --> 00:52:28,146
Head us back now.

750
00:52:33,156 --> 00:52:35,368
- Did we get him?

751
00:52:35,368 --> 00:52:37,201
- He damn near go you.

752
00:52:38,174 --> 00:52:41,341
I never saw anything like that.

753
00:52:41,341 --> 00:52:43,676
- But, did we get him?

754
00:52:43,676 --> 00:52:45,759
- No, we did not get him.

755
00:52:48,512 --> 00:52:52,513
Wells' boat where was
he when we needed him?

756
00:52:52,513 --> 00:52:55,930
- He's probably out buying up some boats.

757
00:53:18,856 --> 00:53:21,235
- I'd say he was at least 30 feet long,

758
00:53:21,235 --> 00:53:22,978
and that's a conservative estimate.

759
00:53:22,978 --> 00:53:23,811
Would you say that, Peter?

760
00:53:23,811 --> 00:53:24,753
- Yep.

761
00:53:24,753 --> 00:53:26,800
Hit him with two power heads.

762
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,451
He just kept coming.

763
00:53:28,451 --> 00:53:30,351
- Did you get a look at him?

764
00:53:30,351 --> 00:53:32,370
- Got a look at him, Mr. Wells?

765
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:34,068
It was eye to eye.

766
00:53:34,068 --> 00:53:35,542
- [Peter] How'd you get back in so quick?

767
00:53:35,542 --> 00:53:36,573
- Back?

768
00:53:36,573 --> 00:53:37,554
Back from where?

769
00:53:37,554 --> 00:53:39,750
- We just crossed you on your way out.

770
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:40,641
- What are you talking about?

771
00:53:40,641 --> 00:53:42,334
I haven't been on my boat all week.

772
00:53:42,334 --> 00:53:45,097
- [Mr. Olafsen] Your boy took
your boat out, Mr. Wells.

773
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:46,443
He said he had your okay.

774
00:53:46,443 --> 00:53:47,719
There were four of 'em.

775
00:53:47,719 --> 00:53:49,370
Your Jenny too, Mr. Benton.

776
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:51,428
Said they were going off to Eagle Rock.

777
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:54,095
(ominous music)

778
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:09,291
- There!

779
00:54:10,509 --> 00:54:12,319
There, over there!

780
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,381
Look, there, look!

781
00:54:14,381 --> 00:54:15,629
- Look at the size of that mother!

782
00:54:15,629 --> 00:54:16,693
Come on!

783
00:54:16,693 --> 00:54:18,943
- Come on, let's get to it.

784
00:54:19,983 --> 00:54:22,816
- [Dave] Get closer for me, shark!

785
00:54:24,133 --> 00:54:26,047
- We might not get another
chance at this, guys.

786
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:27,034
Faster!

787
00:54:27,034 --> 00:54:28,750
- It's bigger than the boat!

788
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:31,167
(gun firing)

789
00:54:39,024 --> 00:54:39,857
(gun racking)

790
00:54:39,857 --> 00:54:42,523
(gun firing)

791
00:54:42,523 --> 00:54:43,426
(gun racking)

792
00:54:43,426 --> 00:54:46,495
(gun firing)

793
00:54:46,495 --> 00:54:48,404
- It's coming right at us.

794
00:54:48,404 --> 00:54:49,722
(banging)

795
00:54:49,722 --> 00:54:52,870
- It has to be underneath the boat!

796
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:53,870
- Watch out!

797
00:54:57,241 --> 00:54:58,863
- Come on Billy Joe, get going.

798
00:54:58,863 --> 00:55:01,530
(ominous music)

799
00:55:03,637 --> 00:55:07,035
- Something's jamming the throttle.

800
00:55:07,035 --> 00:55:09,702
(ominous music)

801
00:55:29,767 --> 00:55:32,267
- Why don't we lower the bait?

802
00:55:50,506 --> 00:55:53,006
(tense music)

803
00:55:57,601 --> 00:56:00,703
(splashing)

804
00:56:00,703 --> 00:56:03,203
(tense music)

805
00:56:04,112 --> 00:56:06,583
(screaming)

806
00:56:06,583 --> 00:56:09,237
(tense music)

807
00:56:09,237 --> 00:56:11,570
(splashing)

808
00:56:15,467 --> 00:56:16,627
- Let go!

809
00:56:16,627 --> 00:56:19,855
(tense music)

810
00:56:19,855 --> 00:56:21,933
(screaming)

811
00:56:21,933 --> 00:56:24,433
(tense music)

812
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:31,354
Pull her out!

813
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:33,187
- [Jenny] Pull me out.

814
00:56:36,062 --> 00:56:36,895
Dave!

815
00:56:43,884 --> 00:56:45,620
- [Dave] Jenny, Jenny.

816
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:48,287
(ominous music)

817
00:56:50,291 --> 00:56:52,923
- Dave, Dave, here comes help.

818
00:56:52,923 --> 00:56:55,057
Come on, pull her out.

819
00:56:55,057 --> 00:56:57,724
(siren blaring)

820
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:11,173
- Get her to room one.

821
00:57:26,502 --> 00:57:27,819
- [Public Address] Miss
Davis, please report

822
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:30,652
to the emergency room immediately.

823
00:57:34,586 --> 00:57:38,169
Dr. Shields please call
the emergency room.

824
00:57:57,448 --> 00:58:01,217
- Excuse me, how much longer
before I hear something?

825
00:58:01,217 --> 00:58:02,733
- [Nurse] We don't know
exactly when surgery

826
00:58:02,733 --> 00:58:04,535
will be finished.

827
00:58:04,535 --> 00:58:05,535
- Thank you.

828
00:58:06,836 --> 00:58:08,419
- Peter, I'm sorry.

829
00:58:09,522 --> 00:58:11,341
- It's not your fault.

830
00:58:11,341 --> 00:58:12,402
If it hadn't been for your helicopter,

831
00:58:12,402 --> 00:58:14,711
we'd have lost her for sure.

832
00:58:14,711 --> 00:58:16,128
- It is my fault.

833
00:58:17,501 --> 00:58:18,635
- No, you had no way of knowing

834
00:58:18,635 --> 00:58:21,104
they were gonna take your boat.

835
00:58:21,104 --> 00:58:23,604
- Yeah, but I should've known.

836
00:58:29,013 --> 00:58:32,164
- Please nurse, it's
been more than an hour.

837
00:58:32,164 --> 00:58:33,926
Can't you tell me something.

838
00:58:33,926 --> 00:58:34,829
- [Nurse] I'm sorry.

839
00:58:34,829 --> 00:58:38,685
When the doctor's finished,
you'll be able to go in.

840
00:58:38,685 --> 00:58:41,737
- Dad, I only wanted to help you.

841
00:58:41,737 --> 00:58:43,987
(smacking)

842
00:58:46,393 --> 00:58:50,560
- [Public Address] Miss Davis,
please call the operator.

843
00:58:53,987 --> 00:58:56,487
(funky music)

844
00:59:16,193 --> 00:59:17,943
- Hang in there, kid.

845
00:59:18,829 --> 00:59:20,912
(crying)

846
00:59:22,379 --> 00:59:24,796
- Oh God, it just isn't fair.

847
00:59:28,261 --> 00:59:30,761
(funky music)

848
00:59:46,298 --> 00:59:48,024
- [Public Address] If there's
a surgeon in the house,

849
00:59:48,024 --> 00:59:51,102
please call the emergency room.

850
00:59:51,102 --> 00:59:55,452
- Mr. Benton, she's awake
now if you'd like to see her

851
00:59:55,452 --> 00:59:56,952
for a few minutes.

852
00:59:58,453 --> 00:59:59,798
- Does she know?

853
00:59:59,798 --> 01:00:02,628
- No, she's still pretty
groggy from the anesthetic.

854
01:00:02,628 --> 01:00:04,466
- She'll feel her missing leg for months

855
01:00:04,466 --> 01:00:06,049
perhaps for a year.

856
01:00:09,803 --> 01:00:11,148
- Well there's no need
to say anything now.

857
01:00:11,148 --> 01:00:13,148
She'll know soon enough.

858
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:18,053
- You go.

859
01:00:19,137 --> 01:00:19,970
I can't.

860
01:00:21,654 --> 01:00:22,571
I'm afraid.

861
01:01:01,417 --> 01:01:03,700
- [Peter] You were just lying there,

862
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:06,700
blood all over your leg, not moving.

863
01:01:10,058 --> 01:01:14,176
I ran over to you, and I
started to pick you up.

864
01:01:14,176 --> 01:01:16,386
You were so little then.

865
01:01:16,386 --> 01:01:20,469
All of a sudden, you looked
up at me, and I knew.

866
01:01:23,225 --> 01:01:26,392
I knew you didn't want me to help you.

867
01:01:27,336 --> 01:01:30,970
You wanted to do this one yourself,

868
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:34,553
so I backed off, and
I watched you wipe off

869
01:01:35,943 --> 01:01:39,193
the blood and the gravel from your leg.

870
01:01:40,917 --> 01:01:44,551
And, you got up and you
stared down at that great

871
01:01:44,551 --> 01:01:48,551
big bicycle like it was
some kind of wild animal

872
01:01:50,335 --> 01:01:51,668
challenging you.

873
01:01:54,357 --> 01:01:56,059
And, you picked it up.

874
01:01:56,059 --> 01:01:58,301
It must've been twice as big as you,

875
01:01:58,301 --> 01:01:59,551
kinda shook it.

876
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:04,788
You got back on, and down
the road you went again.

877
01:02:04,788 --> 01:02:08,538
I remember my heart
skipped a couple of beats

878
01:02:10,765 --> 01:02:14,848
partly out of concern,
but I was so proud of you.

879
01:02:19,927 --> 01:02:21,716
Only this time, you
won't have to do it alone

880
01:02:21,716 --> 01:02:23,538
because I'm here, and your mom's here.

881
01:02:23,538 --> 01:02:26,788
And, we've got a whole lot of strength.

882
01:02:27,883 --> 01:02:29,133
It's all yours.

883
01:02:32,372 --> 01:02:35,872
You're going to walk out of this hospital.

884
01:02:37,619 --> 01:02:41,702
Walk with that great big
grin on your face again,

885
01:02:47,046 --> 01:02:48,213
I promise you.

886
01:02:50,984 --> 01:02:54,440
I know sometimes life seems unfair.

887
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,607
(moaning)

888
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:58,673
- Help me.

889
01:03:02,466 --> 01:03:03,299
Help me.

890
01:03:03,299 --> 01:03:04,165
- It's all right.

891
01:03:04,165 --> 01:03:05,415
- Daddy please.

892
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:08,415
Kill it.

893
01:03:08,415 --> 01:03:09,248
Kill it!

894
01:03:10,152 --> 01:03:12,319
(yelling)

895
01:03:37,325 --> 01:03:38,701
- There it is.

896
01:03:38,701 --> 01:03:40,284
Take us down to 20.

897
01:03:46,996 --> 01:03:48,996
Okay take us down lower.

898
01:04:27,879 --> 01:04:30,212
(splashing)

899
01:04:56,054 --> 01:04:56,971
Up, up, up.

900
01:04:59,376 --> 01:05:01,709
(splashing)

901
01:05:18,607 --> 01:05:19,440
Stop.

902
01:05:22,155 --> 01:05:23,488
Pull up, Bernie.

903
01:05:31,353 --> 01:05:32,186
Bernie!

904
01:05:34,357 --> 01:05:35,190
- [Bernie] Hang on.

905
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:36,179
- Bernie!

906
01:05:36,179 --> 01:05:37,012
Bernie!

907
01:05:39,928 --> 01:05:40,761
Bernie!

908
01:05:41,712 --> 01:05:44,449
(yelling)

909
01:05:44,449 --> 01:05:45,685
Bernie!

910
01:05:45,685 --> 01:05:48,185
(tense music)

911
01:05:54,388 --> 01:05:55,221
Pull up.

912
01:05:56,448 --> 01:05:57,781
Bernie, pull up.

913
01:06:01,952 --> 01:06:04,111
(yelling)

914
01:06:04,111 --> 01:06:06,611
(tense music)

915
01:06:10,987 --> 01:06:11,820
Bernie!

916
01:06:13,308 --> 01:06:14,141
Lower.

917
01:06:15,217 --> 01:06:17,717
(tense music)

918
01:06:20,902 --> 01:06:21,735
Up, up!

919
01:06:28,437 --> 01:06:30,604
(yelling)

920
01:06:34,476 --> 01:06:36,809
(splashing)

921
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:41,795
(tense music)

922
01:06:56,398 --> 01:06:59,065
(ominous music)

923
01:07:06,153 --> 01:07:09,404
- Ron, see if you can
contact Wells' chopper.

924
01:07:09,404 --> 01:07:11,087
They can help with the spotting.

925
01:07:11,087 --> 01:07:12,087
- All right.

926
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:17,348
This is Hamer to the
Brooks' Point heliport.

927
01:07:17,348 --> 01:07:19,098
Do you read me, over?

928
01:07:25,008 --> 01:07:26,087
- Done the shopping?

929
01:07:26,087 --> 01:07:27,948
- [Jimmy] You bet, 20 pounds.

930
01:07:27,948 --> 01:07:30,115
- Let's have a look at it.

931
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:34,638
Let's hope he hasn't gone elsewhere.

932
01:07:34,638 --> 01:07:37,569
I want to entice him right down the lens.

933
01:07:37,569 --> 01:07:38,992
- [Jimmy] With me behind it, you ain't.

934
01:07:38,992 --> 01:07:40,500
- Is that spare ribs?

935
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:43,689
- You might say, horse spare ribs.

936
01:07:43,689 --> 01:07:45,004
- Okay.

937
01:07:45,004 --> 01:07:47,004
We'll get that Emmy yet.

938
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:04,406
- Ron, there's some debris
floating off to starboard.

939
01:08:06,896 --> 01:08:09,146
- We'll take a closer look.

940
01:08:22,402 --> 01:08:25,152
(dramatic music)

941
01:08:27,017 --> 01:08:28,434
Eagle Rock again.

942
01:08:29,295 --> 01:08:31,957
He's made this his place.

943
01:08:31,957 --> 01:08:34,079
- He's down there now.

944
01:08:34,079 --> 01:08:35,853
I can feel it.

945
01:08:35,853 --> 01:08:38,603
(dramatic music)

946
01:09:15,648 --> 01:09:16,489
- See anything?

947
01:09:16,489 --> 01:09:19,153
- Just a shark, said he'd be back.

948
01:09:19,153 --> 01:09:21,003
- That's funny.

949
01:09:21,003 --> 01:09:23,774
Okay let's get to work on the camera.

950
01:09:23,774 --> 01:09:26,027
- Do you think this thing's gonna work?

951
01:09:26,027 --> 01:09:27,660
- It's sure worth a try.

952
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:29,183
Gonna bring that king size killer shark

953
01:09:29,183 --> 01:09:30,865
into millions of living rooms.

954
01:09:30,865 --> 01:09:33,160
- And, you'll be on
your way to the network.

955
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,243
- With my star cameraman.

956
01:09:36,609 --> 01:09:38,462
- The answer is no.

957
01:09:38,462 --> 01:09:39,377
This is my boat.

958
01:09:39,377 --> 01:09:40,480
Those are my orders.

959
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:41,647
- No, damn it!

960
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:43,798
That's my shark, Ron.

961
01:09:43,798 --> 01:09:45,227
It has to be.

962
01:09:45,227 --> 01:09:47,328
- The hell it is!

963
01:09:47,328 --> 01:09:50,739
Not just your shark,
but your daughter's leg.

964
01:09:50,739 --> 01:09:52,179
There are bodies out
there and more to come

965
01:09:52,179 --> 01:09:54,097
if we don't end this thing.

966
01:09:54,097 --> 01:09:55,180
Jesus, Peter.

967
01:09:57,035 --> 01:10:00,503
Don't you think I know the
pain you're going through?

968
01:10:00,503 --> 01:10:01,970
But, he's down there.

969
01:10:01,970 --> 01:10:05,095
He's down there now,
he's waiting to attack.

970
01:10:05,095 --> 01:10:09,171
It's been his pattern just
before he makes an attack.

971
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:11,612
And, this is the only
thing we have to stop him,

972
01:10:11,612 --> 01:10:13,097
and there's only one dynamite belt.

973
01:10:13,097 --> 01:10:16,930
So what's the sense in
risking both our necks?

974
01:10:18,724 --> 01:10:21,683
I been killing shark most of my life

975
01:10:21,683 --> 01:10:24,218
while you've been writing
most of your life.

976
01:10:24,218 --> 01:10:27,508
So I'm the expert here, and
that's what it's gonna take

977
01:10:27,508 --> 01:10:29,175
to kill the bastard.

978
01:10:30,798 --> 01:10:33,134
Peter, I need your help.

979
01:10:33,134 --> 01:10:34,192
I need you on this ship.

980
01:10:34,192 --> 01:10:36,024
If I'm in trouble down
there, you're the only one

981
01:10:36,024 --> 01:10:38,308
that can bail me out.

982
01:10:38,308 --> 01:10:42,225
Now is what I'm saying
making any sense to you?

983
01:10:48,654 --> 01:10:51,409
- All right, all right,
let's stop arguing about it

984
01:10:51,409 --> 01:10:55,576
like a bunch of damn fools
and get on with it, Jesus.

985
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:59,553
Sometimes you can be a
real pain in the ass,

986
01:10:59,553 --> 01:11:00,720
you know that?

987
01:11:05,244 --> 01:11:06,161
- This one.

988
01:11:08,851 --> 01:11:10,434
Other one, come on.

989
01:11:22,404 --> 01:11:24,737
(splashing)

990
01:11:42,644 --> 01:11:45,144
(gun racking)

991
01:11:50,763 --> 01:11:53,430
(ominous music)

992
01:12:42,622 --> 01:12:45,122
(tense music)

993
01:13:08,802 --> 01:13:10,969
(banging)

994
01:13:14,371 --> 01:13:16,871
(tense music)

995
01:13:47,913 --> 01:13:49,990
(splashing)

996
01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:52,490
(tense music)

997
01:14:28,505 --> 01:14:31,172
(ominous music)

998
01:14:42,514 --> 01:14:44,847
(splashing)

999
01:15:28,767 --> 01:15:30,107
- [Bob] You Riley?

1000
01:15:30,107 --> 01:15:30,940
- Martin?

1001
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:34,422
- Yeah Bob Martin, good to see you.

1002
01:15:34,422 --> 01:15:35,422
- All right.

1003
01:15:36,801 --> 01:15:37,876
This is where I set up?

1004
01:15:37,876 --> 01:15:39,304
- Uh huh, there.

1005
01:15:39,304 --> 01:15:41,303
We put the bait at the end of the pier.

1006
01:15:41,303 --> 01:15:42,987
We'll have a remote camera
covering the action.

1007
01:15:42,987 --> 01:15:43,981
- [Riley] Well, if your shark shows up,

1008
01:15:43,981 --> 01:15:45,889
it'll be over real fast.

1009
01:15:45,889 --> 01:15:48,726
(ominous music)

1010
01:15:48,726 --> 01:15:50,571
(Gloria speaking)

1011
01:15:50,571 --> 01:15:51,691
How was she when you left?

1012
01:15:51,691 --> 01:15:52,524
- She's much better.

1013
01:15:52,524 --> 01:15:53,571
They gave her a sedative.

1014
01:15:53,571 --> 01:15:54,733
She's asleep now.

1015
01:15:54,733 --> 01:15:57,400
(ominous music)

1016
01:15:59,464 --> 01:16:02,631
- [Gloria] She's gonna need everybody.

1017
01:16:03,737 --> 01:16:05,837
- What's the television here for?

1018
01:16:05,837 --> 01:16:08,170
- Something, fish, and blood as usual.

1019
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:09,147
- Don't even mention it.

1020
01:16:09,147 --> 01:16:10,495
I get seasick looking at the ocean.

1021
01:16:10,495 --> 01:16:13,111
Sight of blood will put
me out like a light.

1022
01:16:13,111 --> 01:16:15,166
- This little baby's special.

1023
01:16:15,166 --> 01:16:16,583
See these shells?

1024
01:16:19,224 --> 01:16:20,817
Second and a half detonation.

1025
01:16:20,817 --> 01:16:22,592
Enough of a charge to open up a tank.

1026
01:16:22,592 --> 01:16:24,903
- Hey what'll that do to my camera?

1027
01:16:24,903 --> 01:16:26,873
- You just keep him out
of the line of fire.

1028
01:16:26,873 --> 01:16:27,706
- You bet.

1029
01:16:35,386 --> 01:16:38,053
(ominous music)

1030
01:16:41,894 --> 01:16:43,987
Now you have a chance to
live up to your reputation.

1031
01:16:43,987 --> 01:16:45,822
- Don't worry it's just a fish.

1032
01:16:45,822 --> 01:16:48,298
The camera jockey better be fast.

1033
01:16:48,298 --> 01:16:50,965
(ominous music)

1034
01:17:12,262 --> 01:17:13,962
- Who's the guy with the gun?

1035
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:16,629
(ominous music)

1036
01:17:26,259 --> 01:17:28,592
(crunching)

1037
01:17:37,492 --> 01:17:39,659
(yelling)

1038
01:17:43,935 --> 01:17:45,838
- Keep your camera rolling.

1039
01:17:45,838 --> 01:17:46,964
You get me some good shots of that shark,

1040
01:17:46,964 --> 01:17:48,572
and I'll buy you a lobster dinner.

1041
01:17:48,572 --> 01:17:50,023
I'm going back to the van.

1042
01:17:50,023 --> 01:17:52,190
(yelling)

1043
01:17:59,237 --> 01:18:00,843
Joe, we're in business at last.

1044
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:01,893
Get down to the pier quick.

1045
01:18:01,893 --> 01:18:03,393
Come on hurray up.

1046
01:18:05,654 --> 01:18:07,821
(yelling)

1047
01:18:11,697 --> 01:18:12,757
- Damn it.

1048
01:18:12,757 --> 01:18:14,293
I lost my frigging rifle.

1049
01:18:14,293 --> 01:18:16,460
(yelling)

1050
01:18:22,783 --> 01:18:24,041
- Jimmy can you here me?

1051
01:18:24,041 --> 01:18:24,875
- Yeah sure, man.

1052
01:18:24,875 --> 01:18:26,036
Somebody get us some help down here

1053
01:18:26,036 --> 01:18:27,675
before this shark has us for lunch.

1054
01:18:27,675 --> 01:18:28,799
Call the Coast Guard.

1055
01:18:28,799 --> 01:18:31,882
- Sure I'll contact them immediately.

1056
01:18:35,466 --> 01:18:37,633
(yelling)

1057
01:18:39,571 --> 01:18:40,404
- There's a Shark.

1058
01:18:40,404 --> 01:18:42,821
- [Dave] Don't leave us here.

1059
01:18:44,058 --> 01:18:45,871
- Hey come on hurray up!

1060
01:18:45,871 --> 01:18:47,288
Get a boat to us.

1061
01:18:48,712 --> 01:18:50,795
- Don't just stand there.

1062
01:18:52,951 --> 01:18:54,567
- Oh Jack, hold me.

1063
01:18:54,567 --> 01:18:57,486
(yelling)

1064
01:18:57,486 --> 01:19:00,153
(ominous music)

1065
01:19:11,394 --> 01:19:12,227
- [Billy] Screw it.

1066
01:19:12,227 --> 01:19:13,213
- He's playing with us.

1067
01:19:13,213 --> 01:19:14,227
He must've gone.

1068
01:19:14,227 --> 01:19:16,239
He's not moving anymore.

1069
01:19:16,239 --> 01:19:18,067
If he doesn't come
back, we'll swim ashore.

1070
01:19:18,067 --> 01:19:20,811
- [Dave] Wait are you kidding?

1071
01:19:20,811 --> 01:19:23,144
(splashing)

1072
01:19:24,412 --> 01:19:25,412
- It's back!

1073
01:19:27,302 --> 01:19:28,806
It's back!

1074
01:19:28,806 --> 01:19:29,639
It's back!

1075
01:19:31,413 --> 01:19:33,580
(yelling)

1076
01:19:35,946 --> 01:19:38,113
(yelling)

1077
01:19:40,509 --> 01:19:42,342
It's going to kill us.

1078
01:19:50,161 --> 01:19:51,006
- [Jimmy] Where's Bob?

1079
01:19:51,006 --> 01:19:53,287
For God's sake where are you?

1080
01:19:53,287 --> 01:19:54,333
Can you hear me?

1081
01:19:54,333 --> 01:19:55,270
Come on, Bob.

1082
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:56,603

At last our waters are free of danger.

our town has finally been

01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:35,153
destroyed.

spot with the story.

Benton who made it all possible.

How does it feel to be a hero?

1133
01:26:02,334 --> 01:26:05,827

gotta say something.

1134
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:06,660
Please.

1135
01:26:08,088 --> 01:26:10,338
