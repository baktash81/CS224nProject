I'd like to report fire.

He didn't take no chances.

35

[man 1] Piece of shit waited
'till they were asleep.

40
00:04:05,157 --> 00:04:07,595
So, he pours the accelerant
here.

41
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:12,687
-And it flashes over.
-It goes straight out the door.

42
00:04:13,644 --> 00:04:15,777
-Right along that baseboard.
-Yup.

43
00:04:16,908 --> 00:04:18,170
Onto the porch.

44
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:21,086
Son of a bitch.

45
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:22,827

47
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:29,356
Thank you for coming down,
folks.

-I know how hard this must be.
-[phone continues ringing]

49
00:04:32,184 --> 00:04:35,797
This is Mr. Fogg, Mr. Vasquez.
They're investigating the fire.

50
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:38,887
[Fogg] Our condolences.

51
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,976
Y'all find out anything?

52
00:04:41,237 --> 00:04:42,760
We're still trying to find
our way.

53
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,894
Think you might be able to help
us figure out a couple things.

54
00:04:46,155 --> 00:04:47,156
Of course.

55
00:04:48,984 --> 00:04:50,290
It's Stacy, right?

56
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:54,468
Now, you weren't in the house
at the time of the fire.

57
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:55,512
That's right.

58
00:04:56,687 --> 00:04:58,298
She works nights sometimes,

59
00:04:58,341 --> 00:04:59,995
stopped on the way home
from work.

60
00:05:02,911 --> 00:05:04,565
Whereabouts was it you stopped,
darling?

61
00:05:09,744 --> 00:05:13,095
I stopped at the Salvation Army
to get the babies some presents.

62
00:05:16,707 --> 00:05:19,319
-At 9:00 in the morning?
-Well, Christmas is coming

63
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:21,669
-and we're broke, so...
-Of course.

64
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:24,324
How about the day before?

65
00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:27,370
Anything unusual happen?

66
00:05:29,677 --> 00:05:30,678
No, sir.

00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:46,389
Hey, there.

70
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:48,870
How are my precious ladies?

71
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:51,176
Ooh, why are you crying?

72
00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:54,136
They've been crying all fucking
morning.

73
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:55,355
You girls are lucky.

74
00:05:56,965 --> 00:05:58,401
If your mama wasn't so pretty,
you three wouldn't be here.

75
00:05:58,445 --> 00:05:59,968
Oh, you fucking stink.

76
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:01,970
What, do you think you can
just stay out all night

77
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:03,275
and then come home
and sweet-talk me?

78
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,755
Honey, I had a couple o' drinks.

79
00:06:05,277 --> 00:06:07,715
I already got one DUI,
so I stopped at Mikey's.

80
00:06:08,063 --> 00:06:10,587
[kids continue screaming]

81
00:06:10,631 --> 00:06:12,415
-What?
-Nothing.

82
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:16,985
Have at it.

83
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:22,338
So, that night,
you went to work?

84
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,560
Yeah, I work nights.
We need the money.

85
00:06:26,951 --> 00:06:28,605
And you stayed at home
with the kids?

86
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:30,564
-You do that a lot?
-That's right.

87
00:06:31,913 --> 00:06:34,132
I guess I'm one of them
stay-at-home dads

88
00:06:34,176 --> 00:06:35,569
everybody's talking about.

89
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:42,402
There's another dinner in the
oven if you're hungry.

90
00:06:44,273 --> 00:06:45,448
Who is it this time, Todd?

91
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:46,406
Who was who?

92
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,452
I already told you

93
00:06:49,496 --> 00:06:51,541
-where I was last night.
-You ain't told me shit.

94
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:53,500
You think I'm stupid?
What the fuck is this?

95
00:06:53,935 --> 00:06:55,240
Baby, you're the one that said

96
00:06:55,284 --> 00:06:56,633
you don't wanna have
no more children.

97
00:06:56,677 --> 00:06:58,896
Then what's it doing in your
wallet, you bastard?

98
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,810
I don't know.

99
00:07:01,377 --> 00:07:02,987
-I thought maybe surprise sex--
-You're such a fucking liar.

100
00:07:03,031 --> 00:07:05,207
I could smell the bitch on you
when you walked in this morning.

101
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,210
-I'm not lying to you, honey.
-Mm-hmm. You ain't worth shit

102
00:07:08,253 --> 00:07:09,820
-for a husband.
-Bitch!

103
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:13,041
I'm here every goddamn day
taking care of these kids.

104
00:07:13,084 --> 00:07:14,346
Oh, yeah? And why's that?

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,393
Why are you here every goddamn
day taking care of these kids?

106
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,222
Because you don't have
a fucking job, that's why.

107
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:21,963
Because you are a fucking loser.

108
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:23,747
Better shut the fuck up
that shit right now--

109
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,140
Or what?

110
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,750
-I swear to God, woman.
-You hit me again? Go on.

111
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,100
Oh, yeah, that's right. You
can't hit me.

112
00:07:29,144 --> 00:07:30,885
Because if you do,
then I can't go to work,

113
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:33,235
and I can't make you money
to go out drinking and fucking

114
00:07:33,278 --> 00:07:34,802
whatever the fuck else you do.

115
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:41,678
So, Stacy went to work that
night and you just, uh,

116
00:07:41,983 --> 00:07:42,984
stayed in bed?

117
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:44,464
[bottles clinking]

118
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:48,250
Yes, sir.

119
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:49,904
Had a few beers, maybe?

120
00:07:52,863 --> 00:07:53,864
No.

121
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,214
[Fogg] Reckon your kids
sleep pretty sound?

122
00:07:57,389 --> 00:07:58,347
[Cameron Todd Willingham]
Usually.

123
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:02,438
And then that night?

124
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,745
It was morning.

125
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:08,270
I was asleep, so I thought I
was dreaming at first.

126
00:08:08,313 --> 00:08:09,576
-[girl] Daddy!
-But then I realized

127
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:12,013
I could hear Amber screaming,
"Daddy! Daddy!"

128
00:08:13,318 --> 00:08:14,581
[Amber] Daddy!

129
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:19,368
Everything was full of smoke.

130
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:21,413
I couldn't see nothing
but black.

131
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:22,676
It smelled like it did

132
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:24,504
when the microwave
blowed up last month.

133
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:26,549
-Fires, lights popping.
-[Amber] Daddy!

134
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:27,637
Girls!

135
00:08:27,985 --> 00:08:29,900
So, I made it to their room
and...

136
00:08:29,944 --> 00:08:31,772
[Todd grunting, gasping]

137
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:33,774
I had to kick through
the child-proof thing.

138
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:36,298
-[grunting]
-[smashing, crackling]

139
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,562
I never felt anything
so hot in my life.

140
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:41,477
[coughing]

141
00:08:42,217 --> 00:08:44,654
I thought I'd found Amber,
but she was gone.

142
00:08:44,698 --> 00:08:45,742
Amber.

143
00:08:48,658 --> 00:08:49,659
Girls.

144
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:51,922
Amber!

145
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:53,750
Girls!

146
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:56,448
I couldn't take the heat, so...

147
00:08:57,275 --> 00:08:59,582
I had to get outside, catch my
breath.

148
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:02,890
-[crackling]
-[spluttering, choking]

149
00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:05,022
That's when I hollered out

150
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:07,024
for my neighbor
to call emergency.

151
00:09:16,425 --> 00:09:18,645
Can you think of why anyone
would wanna hurt your family?

152
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:19,950
No, sir.

153
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:27,697
We had three
of the prettiest babies

154
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:29,220
anybody could've asked for.

155
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:33,398
Off and on, we'd fight
and break up for a while,

156
00:09:33,442 --> 00:09:36,010
but it was always the babies
that brought us back together.

157
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:39,056
Neither of us could've lived
without them kids.

158
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:44,932
Sometimes, I wish Amber
had never woke me up.

159
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:51,852
You know, Todd,
you've been in trouble before.

160
00:09:53,201 --> 00:09:54,942
-Yes, sir.
-A couple of those times

161
00:09:54,985 --> 00:09:56,596
when we asked you what happened,

162
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,250
you didn't exactly tell the
truth, isn't that so?

163
00:10:00,556 --> 00:10:01,601
No, sir.

164
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:04,734
But you're telling the truth
now?

165
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:05,692
Yes, sir.

166
00:10:10,784 --> 00:10:14,178
Just as Jesus, the Lamb of God,
was taken too soon,

167
00:10:14,222 --> 00:10:16,528
so too were these three
innocents,

168
00:10:16,572 --> 00:10:18,705
taken back to the bosom
of the Lord.

169
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,708
How else are we to understand

170
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:25,537
the loss of Amber, Karmen,
and Kameron.

171
00:10:31,282 --> 00:10:34,111
Do you wanna stop somewhere
and maybe get...

172
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:36,766
-something to eat?
-Cameron Todd Willingham,

173
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,638
I don't wanna hear your voice.

174
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:40,509
And maybe never again.

175
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:45,209
-I'm hurting, too, baby--
-Did you hear a word I said?

176
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:47,168
Oh, if you're gonna start
demonizing me,

177
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:48,560
-speak to me like--
-I'll speak to you

178
00:10:48,604 --> 00:10:50,475
-however I please.
-You will not either.

179
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:52,390
Baby, if we're ever gonna get
through this,

180
00:10:52,434 --> 00:10:54,349
-we gotta work together on--
-Stop the car.

181
00:10:54,784 --> 00:10:56,438
Stop the car,
let me out of the car.

182
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:58,701
-Why? Why, what's the matter--
-Stop the car!

183
00:10:58,745 --> 00:11:01,269
-I won't stop the car--
-Stop the fucking car, Todd!

184
00:11:01,312 --> 00:11:03,663
-Tell me why.
-Let me out of the car!

185
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:06,100
Stop the fucking car, Todd!

186
00:11:06,143 --> 00:11:08,450
-[tires screeching]
-Let me out of the car!

187
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:10,017
-Stop the fucking car!
-[car horns blaring]

188
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,671
Those were my babies!

189
00:11:11,888 --> 00:11:15,196
Those were my babies
and you didn't save them!

190
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:17,328
They were my babies!

191
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:19,417
My babies, Todd!

192
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,117
[police sirens wailing]

193
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:33,780
[police officer] Driver!

194
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:36,870
Exit the vehicle, put your hands
up where I can see them.

195
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:38,001
Do it now!

196
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,311
Turn around, face away from me.

197
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:45,356
Interlace your hands
behind your head.

198
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:48,098
Do not look back.

199
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:55,497
Cameron Todd Willingham...

200
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:58,630
you're under arrest for murder.

201
00:11:58,674 --> 00:12:00,241
-Murder?
-[officer] You come with me.

202
00:12:00,284 --> 00:12:02,025
-Who did I kill?
-Come on.

203
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:03,679
We'll talk about it
at the station.

204
00:12:05,812 --> 00:12:07,596
[Marty] Let's go, Todd.
You know the way.

205
00:12:08,902 --> 00:12:10,773
I only just buried them, Marty.

206
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,603
This is some fucked up bullshit.

207
00:12:15,473 --> 00:12:16,561
Stand right there.

208
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:25,353
Let's go.

209
00:12:32,882 --> 00:12:35,058
You're a real piece of shit,
you know that?

210
00:12:35,102 --> 00:12:36,407
Your own kids?

211
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,193
-Jesus, man.
-I didn't do it, Marty.

212
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:40,542
Fuck you!

213
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:42,022
Hey, fuck you!

214
00:12:46,026 --> 00:12:47,984
[cellmate] Man, would you get
the fuck down from there?

215
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:49,290
This ain't no fucking zoo!

216
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:51,945
Jesus fucking Christ.

217
00:12:52,597 --> 00:12:54,991
You want a banana?
That'll make you calm down?

218
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:57,515
They ain't gonna throw you no
fucking peanuts,

219
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,647
you know that, right?
[chuckles]

220
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,823
Who're you talking to, boy?

221
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:03,347
I was just talking
to that mullet,

222
00:13:03,391 --> 00:13:04,479
you know,
she's real cute.

223
00:13:04,522 --> 00:13:06,176
She gave me a little wink,
you know.

224
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,659
-This yours?
-Hey.

225
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:16,143
Yours?

226
00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:30,940
Get up.

227
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:33,551
Look, I'm good, man.
I was just fucking around.

228
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:37,120
You ain't gotta take shit
so personal.

229
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,863
You smell like you wanna be left
alone.

230
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:48,871
If you plead guilty,
you might live.

231
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:51,091
I'm not confessing
to something I didn't do.

232
00:13:52,092 --> 00:13:53,745
I'll say any goddamn thing
you like,

233
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:55,660
but I will not say
I killed my own kids.

234
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:56,923
With the evidence they got,

235
00:13:56,966 --> 00:13:58,533
-they're gonna--
-I'm going to take the stand

236
00:13:58,576 --> 00:14:00,665
and I'm gonna talk to the judge
about it.

237
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:02,450
Idiot, they will tear you up
on the stand.

238
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:03,407
Oh, they better.

239
00:14:04,582 --> 00:14:05,670
Boy, you're about as
dumb as you look--

240
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:06,802
What the fuck is wrong
with you, huh?

241
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,021
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Todd, calm down.

242
00:14:08,064 --> 00:14:09,457
Oh, listen to him!

243
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:14,157
They wanna kill me? Good.

244
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,638
They better start
digging my grave now,

245
00:14:16,681 --> 00:14:19,467
because I'll die before I say
I killed my own kids.

246
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:23,558
Boy, I am the only thing between
you and the needle right now.

247
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:26,213
No way in hell
I'm putting you on that stand.

248
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:31,827
[radio presenter] Good morning,
Texas. This is KZYZ.

249
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,569
The phone lines are burning up.
Let's hear from you.

250
00:14:34,612 --> 00:14:36,527
[woman] I never liked him.
I always thought there was

251
00:14:36,571 --> 00:14:37,833
something kind of
off about him,

252
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,182
and it doesn't surprise me
a little bit.

253
00:14:39,226 --> 00:14:40,880
[man] They should fry him.

254
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:42,098
-He needs to burn in hell.
-[woman 2] What kind of daddy

255
00:14:42,142 --> 00:14:43,578
would kill his own babies
like that?

256
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:44,666
[woman 3] Things like this
don't happen here.

257
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:45,667
[man 2]
Hey, I'll shoot him myself.

258
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,886
Boy took three innocent lives.

259
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,322
The only thing I regret is,

260
00:14:48,365 --> 00:14:50,324
we can't kill him
three times over.

261
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,108
[Mr. Jackson]
Members of the jury,

262
00:14:52,152 --> 00:14:54,023
I'd like you to take a look

263
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:57,461
at the sweet faces
of these beautiful babies...

264
00:14:58,114 --> 00:15:00,682
Karmen and Kameron,
barely a year old

265
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:03,598
and already brimming with life.

266
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:08,168
Little Amber, eagerly waiting
for Santa's visit

267
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:10,126
in only two days.

268
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,305
Now, I want you to imagine
these little angels...

269
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:17,829
-[jury gasps]
-...burning in their beds.

270
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:20,920
This was no arson.

271
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,748
This was murder.

272
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:28,449
Well, I barely poked my head
out the door when...

273
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,584
he just stood there with
a strange look in his eyes--

274
00:15:33,628 --> 00:15:35,847
-That's total bullshit.
-[whispers] Shut up.

275
00:15:36,587 --> 00:15:39,503
To the best of your knowledge,
did Todd Willingham

276
00:15:39,547 --> 00:15:42,942
ever make an attempt
to get back in that house?

277
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:46,510
He was too worried about that
car of his.

278
00:15:47,555 --> 00:15:50,514
He didn't try to save those kids
till the cops showed up.

279
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:54,518
And it was like he was...
putting on a show.

280
00:15:55,563 --> 00:15:58,740
Fire talks to you,
it does not lie.

281
00:15:58,783 --> 00:16:00,785
Then what did that fire
tell you?

282
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:04,050
That it was deliberately set
by human hands.

283
00:16:06,226 --> 00:16:07,531
[Mr. Jackson]
Can you be more specific?

284
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:11,144
Someone poured gasoline
through those children's room,

285
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:14,408
even under their bed
in the shape of a pentagram,

286
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:15,844
the symbol of the devil.

287
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:18,934
He kept pouring down the hallway
to the front door,

288
00:16:19,152 --> 00:16:21,981
creating a fire barrier,
preventing any escape.

289
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:27,160
That fire was hotter
than the hinges of hell.

290
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:30,250
We found evidence
of what we call crazed glass,

291
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:32,904
another indication it was goosed
by liquid additive.

292
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:36,734
Worst of all, the refrigerator
was moved to block the backdoor.

293
00:16:37,387 --> 00:16:39,302
Someone made that house
into a death trap.

294
00:16:39,694 --> 00:16:43,872
Inspector Vasquez, how many
arson cases have you worked on?

295
00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:45,917
I reckon more than 1,200 fires.

296
00:16:45,961 --> 00:16:47,484
And to the best
of your knowledge,

297
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,747
have you ever been
mistaken?

298
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:53,012
Sir, fire does not destroy
evidence, it creates it.

299
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:55,884
If I've ever been wrong,
it's never been pointed out.

300
00:16:57,886 --> 00:16:59,148
Mr. Horton?

301
00:16:59,844 --> 00:17:00,976
No questions, Your Honor.

302
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:07,939
Mr. Webb, you shared a cell
with Todd Willingham

303
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:11,030
at the Navarro County Jail,
is that correct?

304
00:17:11,595 --> 00:17:12,640
Yes, sir.

305
00:17:12,944 --> 00:17:15,817
And what did he tell you
at that time?

306
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:18,820
Well, he...

307
00:17:19,647 --> 00:17:20,952
He said that...

308
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:26,132
he came home
and that one of his children

309
00:17:26,175 --> 00:17:29,135
was hurt or even dead
or whatever.

310
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:31,789
-What?
-And then so, he started--

311
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:35,141
He decided that he was gonna
cover it up by starting a fire.

312
00:17:35,184 --> 00:17:36,533
Hell no.

313
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:40,537
Did he tell you who it was
that injured that child?

314
00:17:41,408 --> 00:17:43,018
He did. He said it was his wife.

315
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:44,498
-What?
-Yeah.

316
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,326
He said she was crying,
yeah,

317
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:48,197
and carrying on
with such emotion.

318
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:52,201
He just decided to take some
paper and wad it up,

319
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:55,204
and then he burnt it in a way
that made it look like

320
00:17:55,248 --> 00:17:57,163
them children was playing
with it and such.

321
00:17:57,206 --> 00:18:00,862
And did Willingham ever threaten
you about telling anybody

322
00:18:00,905 --> 00:18:02,907
-what he had told you?
-Yeah.

323
00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:05,910
He pointed his finger at me
and did like this.

324
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:07,086
I'll kill you.

325
00:18:08,565 --> 00:18:09,827
-Thank you, Mr. Webb.
-Y'all need to start speaking

326
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:11,307
some fucking truth around here!

327
00:18:11,351 --> 00:18:12,743
-Calm down. You just sit down.
-I am!

328
00:18:12,787 --> 00:18:13,875
No, no, this is corrupt.

329
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:15,137
Don't believe that shit.

330
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:16,530
That shit never happened, Judge.

331
00:18:16,573 --> 00:18:17,792
Control your client.

332
00:18:17,835 --> 00:18:19,054
-Counselor.
-[Todd] That shit didn't happen.

333
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,926
-Counselor.
-You took an oath, didn't you?

334
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,711
Start speaking some
fucking truth then, boy.

335
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:26,409
-This is my courtroom, sir.
-[gavel bangs]

336
00:18:26,453 --> 00:18:28,933
[judge] Mr. Jackson,
call your next witness.

337
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:33,068
[Mr. Jackson] Mr. Evans,
you have firsthand knowledge

338
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,898
of Todd Willingham's history
of violent behavior, don't you?

339
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:38,029
Yes, sir.

340
00:18:38,073 --> 00:18:39,161
Would you explain to us

341
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:40,815
what transpired
between the two of you?

342
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:44,819
I mean, maybe me and Stacy
was flirting a little,

343
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:46,429
but it ain't mean nothing.

344
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:51,391
Hell, Stacy, she's like that,
and Todd sort of liked it.

345
00:18:51,782 --> 00:18:54,307
Wasn't no reason
to beat the crap outta me.

346
00:18:54,698 --> 00:18:55,830
Sorry, Your Honor.

347
00:18:57,048 --> 00:18:58,702
Beat me half to death.

348
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:01,923
[Mr. Jackson]
But Mr. Willingham's propensity

349
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:04,926
for violence also found its way
into his home.

350
00:19:05,231 --> 00:19:07,537
Busted lip, black eyes...

351
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:10,497
bruises all over her legs.

352
00:19:12,673 --> 00:19:15,458
Oh, and a red mark on her
stomach where he kicked her.

353
00:19:15,502 --> 00:19:17,112
[Mr. Jackson] Now, Mrs. King...

354
00:19:18,244 --> 00:19:20,333
did she say what she believed

355
00:19:20,376 --> 00:19:23,466
the cause of those beatings
to be?

356
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,511
Yes, sir.

357
00:19:25,512 --> 00:19:26,861
Stacy was pregnant

358
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:28,863
and Todd wanted to make her
have a miscarriage.

359
00:19:28,906 --> 00:19:30,865
[gasps and groans]

360
00:19:39,482 --> 00:19:42,050
Is Cathy King's testimony
correct?

361
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:45,358
-No, sir.
-So, Todd didn't beat you up

362
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:47,229
when he found out
you were pregnant

363
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:48,491
and tried to force you
to abort?

364
00:19:48,883 --> 00:19:49,971
No, sir.

365
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:51,929
He even came with me
to the doctor

366
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:53,366
when I was pregnant
with them twins.

367
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:55,194
He was excited
it might be a boy.

368
00:19:56,151 --> 00:19:59,981
So, the testimony we've heard
about the beatings,

369
00:20:00,024 --> 00:20:00,895
the obscenities?

370
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:03,506
I'm not saying Todd and I
didn't fight,

371
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,204
but I gave him just as many
bruises as he gave me.

372
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,509
[chuckling]

373
00:20:08,642 --> 00:20:10,252
Is it true that the police

374
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:13,299
were called to your home
to control a situation

375
00:20:13,342 --> 00:20:16,345
where Todd Willingham was
intoxicated

376
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:21,524
and calling you a, quote,
"Whore, bitch, and slut?"

377
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:25,267
Yeah. We was always arguing,
it didn't mean nothing.

378
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:26,355
People argue.

379
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,793
Despite the many occasions

380
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:32,796
that he behaved
in such a violent manner,

381
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,624
how can you be so sure

382
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:36,539
that he didn't commit this
crime?

383
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,846
Because he loved those babies.

384
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:41,544
And he loves me.

385
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:43,242
Mrs. Willingham,

386
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:48,072
are you telling us
that all of these witnesses

387
00:20:48,116 --> 00:20:52,251
who have testified to your
husband's violent abuse of you

388
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:54,340
are just lying?

389
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,169
I don't know.

390
00:20:58,431 --> 00:21:00,955
Do you have any idea why
they would lie?

391
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,393
No.

392
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,833
Now, you were raised
by your grandmother.

393
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:15,274
Your mother was a victim
of family violence, wasn't she?

394
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:24,283
Mm-hmm.

395
00:21:25,414 --> 00:21:26,285
Can you tell us
what happened to her?

396
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:27,634
[defense] Objection.

397
00:21:27,677 --> 00:21:29,853
-Irrelevant, Your Honor.
-Overruled.

398
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:31,855
The witness will
answer the question.

399
00:21:32,508 --> 00:21:33,770
Mrs. Willingham?

400
00:21:35,816 --> 00:21:36,904
[mumbles] She was...

401
00:21:38,645 --> 00:21:40,516
[Mr. Jackson] I'm sorry.
Can you speak up, please?

402
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:47,218
She was killed.

403
00:21:47,915 --> 00:21:49,003
By your father?

404
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,617
Yes.

405
00:22:01,102 --> 00:22:02,408
No further questions.

406
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:05,715
You don't understand,
Todd is not like that.

407
00:22:06,237 --> 00:22:08,718
Todd would never do anything
to hurt those babies.

408
00:22:08,762 --> 00:22:10,677
He loved those babies
with all his heart.

409
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,983
He treated those babies
better than anybody else did.

410
00:22:13,027 --> 00:22:15,334
He would feed them
and change their diapers,

411
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:18,467
and he potty-trained them,
and you are not listening.

412
00:22:18,511 --> 00:22:20,382
-The witness will step down.
-Everybody in here

413
00:22:20,426 --> 00:22:22,515
making up lies, no one's paying
attention to the fact,

414
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:24,386
no one's telling the fucking
truth!

415
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,388
-The witness is excused.
-No one accepts the truth

416
00:22:26,432 --> 00:22:27,955
or listening to anything
we're saying.

417
00:22:27,998 --> 00:22:29,565
-[judge] Young lady--
-When do we get a chance

418
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:30,479
to say the truth?

419
00:22:32,046 --> 00:22:33,264
-[judge] You will step down.
-I'm sorry, Todd. I'm sorry.

420
00:22:33,526 --> 00:22:34,440
[crying]

421
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:39,662
Mr. Horton,
call your next witness.

422
00:22:39,706 --> 00:22:42,622
-Your Honor, the defense rests.
-Are we all clear

423
00:22:42,665 --> 00:22:44,319
-on what was just said then?
-Todd.

424
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,538
[Todd] Now, hold on a minute.

425
00:22:45,581 --> 00:22:47,017
Before they started
digging up her past,

426
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:48,976
-y'all were clear on that.
-[indistinct arguing]

427
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:51,500
This is the worst kind of crime
there is.

428
00:22:51,544 --> 00:22:53,589
And there's been people
called up to this stand

429
00:22:53,633 --> 00:22:56,505
to lie about me, people who
just don't like me anyway.

430
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:58,725
I just wanna make sure
I get a fair trial, Judge.

431
00:22:58,768 --> 00:23:00,509
I wash my hands of this,
Your Honor.

432
00:23:00,553 --> 00:23:02,381
Ain't that how this shit works?

433
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:04,861
Now, I've sat here and stayed
quiet while y'all paint

434
00:23:04,905 --> 00:23:06,472
the worst possible
picture of me.

435
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:08,604
Ain't I got a right to respond,
Judge?

436
00:23:08,648 --> 00:23:10,084
Well done, son. Well done.

437
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:11,564
-Sit down. Sit down.
-Where are my friends?

438
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:13,435
-[judge] Mr. Jackson....
-[Todd] Where are my family?

439
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:15,872
-...call your next witness.
-People who can vouch for me.

440
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,352
Sir, you need to calm down, sir.

441
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:21,182
The jury will disregard
what they just saw and heard.

442
00:23:21,225 --> 00:23:23,880
Mr. Jackson,
proceed with your summation.

443
00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:36,763
"Whosoever shall harm
one of my children,

444
00:23:37,938 --> 00:23:42,421
it is better for a millstone to
be hung around his neck

445
00:23:43,117 --> 00:23:45,859
and for him to be cast
into the sea."

446
00:23:48,296 --> 00:23:49,645
Members of the jury,

447
00:23:50,603 --> 00:23:54,476
I ask that the words
of Mark 9:42

448
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,174
remind you
of your responsibility...

449
00:23:58,262 --> 00:24:00,047
as they remind me of mine.

450
00:24:01,091 --> 00:24:03,093
[Mr. Jackson]
Two days before Christmas,

451
00:24:04,007 --> 00:24:06,532
Willingham committed the
ultimate crime.

452
00:24:08,403 --> 00:24:11,232
Can there be a more
righteous case

453
00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:14,583
for the imposition
of the ultimate penalty?

454
00:24:17,281 --> 00:24:20,459
Now, whether capital punishment,

455
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:23,244
in this case, will deter others,
I don't know,

456
00:24:23,287 --> 00:24:28,075
but I do know it will deter
Cameron Todd Willingham.

457
00:24:28,336 --> 00:24:30,033
And that is what
the State of Texas

458
00:24:30,077 --> 00:24:32,122
is asking you to do today.

459
00:24:33,036 --> 00:24:34,864
Willingham wrote his own
death sentence

460
00:24:34,908 --> 00:24:36,562
when he killed those children.

461
00:24:39,086 --> 00:24:42,785
It is your duty to carry it out.

462
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:56,582
Sit down, boy.

463
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,236
Only been 40 minutes.

464
00:25:00,281 --> 00:25:02,196
Liberation could take days.

465
00:25:07,027 --> 00:25:08,507
Jury is coming in.

466
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:16,515
[judge] Has the jury panel
reached a verdict?

467
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:18,952
Yes, sir.

468
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:20,606
[judge] Would you pass it
to the bailiff?

469
00:25:32,835 --> 00:25:34,445
Will the defendant rise?

470
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:44,412
By your verdict in this case,
you, the jury,

471
00:25:44,455 --> 00:25:48,547
have found the defendant,
Cameron Todd Willingham,

472
00:25:49,156 --> 00:25:51,941
guilty of the offense of
capital murder,

473
00:25:51,985 --> 00:25:54,422
as charged in the indictment.

474
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,383
Cameron Todd Willingham,

475
00:25:59,993 --> 00:26:02,299
by order of the State of Texas,

476
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:06,390
-you are sentenced to death.
-[gavel thuds]

477
00:26:09,742 --> 00:26:13,093
This is Tower 4. I got eyes on
our boy on the dog run.

478
00:26:18,272 --> 00:26:19,839
[man 1]
Hey, hey, what's up, homie?

479
00:26:20,143 --> 00:26:22,668
[men jeering]

480
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:35,419
-[man 2] Fuck you, get inside
-[man 3] All right, baby killer.

481
00:26:46,996 --> 00:26:49,912
[indistinct chatter]

482
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,002
Now, this here is general
population.

483
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:54,656
Get yourself a good hard look

484
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,745
because you ain't never
gonna see a crowd again, boy.

485
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:58,181
[man] Hey, baby killer.

486
00:26:58,529 --> 00:27:01,489
Like killing babies?
Little bitch. You--

487
00:27:01,532 --> 00:27:02,621
Back up!

488
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,710
[man] Oh, you're a sweet one.

489
00:27:04,753 --> 00:27:06,450
You're gonna get yours,
baby killer.

490
00:27:11,717 --> 00:27:12,935
[officer] That's it, all right.

491
00:27:13,544 --> 00:27:15,764
The long walk to
the death chamber.

492
00:27:17,287 --> 00:27:19,725
The condemned, that's you,
baby killer,

493
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,814
can have his family there,

494
00:27:22,162 --> 00:27:23,685
at least what's left of them
in your case.

495
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:25,426
Ha-ha. [chuckles]

496
00:27:25,469 --> 00:27:27,080
You're gonna see it again,
I promise.

497
00:27:27,428 --> 00:27:30,561
-[door buzzer sounds]
-Welcome to death row.

498
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:32,651
Yeah, I know you're listening,
baby killer.

499
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:34,957
You wanna know what's coming,
you all do.

500
00:27:35,871 --> 00:27:37,046
It could be days.

501
00:27:37,612 --> 00:27:39,309
Shit, it could be years,
but somehow you guys

502
00:27:39,353 --> 00:27:41,007
-are always so surprised.
-[inmate] Your move.

503
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,270
[officer] It happens
just after your last meal.

504
00:27:43,313 --> 00:27:44,837
You can order any damn thing
you want.

505
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,795
I've seen one poor guy
ask for candy.

506
00:27:47,361 --> 00:27:50,364
[chuckles] What about you,
baby killer? What's your poison?

507
00:27:50,407 --> 00:27:53,497
Oh, poison! Injection.

508
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:55,369
You get it? Get your ass
in there.

509
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,589
-Unhook him.
-[officer 2] Let's go.

510
00:27:59,025 --> 00:28:01,288
First, we strap your ass
to that table,

511
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:04,204
and then one of us
puts in the IV.

512
00:28:04,247 --> 00:28:05,727
Of course,
we don't always get it right.

513
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:06,815
Sometimes the fella lays there

514
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:09,035
just screaming in agony
for hours,

515
00:28:09,078 --> 00:28:10,601
begging to be put out of
his misery.

516
00:28:10,645 --> 00:28:11,690
What if I'm innocent?

517
00:28:11,907 --> 00:28:13,692
[chuckles]

518
00:28:13,996 --> 00:28:15,345
Nobody ever done it,
baby killer.

519
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,870
No, it was their best friend
who done it, or...

520
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:20,786
he didn't know the gun was
loaded, or...

521
00:28:21,525 --> 00:28:23,005
he was just trying to scare 'em.

522
00:28:23,876 --> 00:28:26,400
But, damn, you,
you just stood there

523
00:28:26,443 --> 00:28:28,054
and watched them babies burn.

524
00:28:28,097 --> 00:28:29,795
Now, that's cold.

525
00:28:35,235 --> 00:28:37,193
That's what I'm gonna do
for you, baby killer.

526
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,282
I'm gonna stay there and watch.

527
00:28:40,675 --> 00:28:42,808
And when they pump that shit
inside of you...

528
00:28:44,897 --> 00:28:47,595
you are gonna burn
from the inside out.

529
00:28:47,987 --> 00:28:49,031
A-107.

530
00:29:02,436 --> 00:29:04,873
[door buzzer sounds]

531
00:29:08,921 --> 00:29:09,878
[man through vent] Hey!

532
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:11,924
You that Willingham fella?

533
00:29:14,578 --> 00:29:17,190
You the boy that
burned them babies?

534
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:19,583
[man cackling]

535
00:29:20,323 --> 00:29:23,326
Hey, we got something special
for you.

537
00:29:33,554 --> 00:29:34,555
Up through there.

538
00:29:36,557 --> 00:29:38,428
[man] Hey, it's the baby killer.

539
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,128
-What's up, bitch?
-[laughing]

540
00:29:42,171 --> 00:29:43,433
Stop, face the wall.

541
00:29:44,957 --> 00:29:46,828
You get one shower every two
days, that's it.

542
00:29:49,744 --> 00:29:52,225
[grunting, groaning]

543
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,662
We got a fight
in the shower block.

544
00:29:54,705 --> 00:29:58,840
-[alarm sounds]
-[all grunting]

545
00:29:58,884 --> 00:30:01,800
-[man] Hey, come here, boy.
-[man 2] Get him.

546
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,499
[indistinct shouting]

547
00:30:06,717 --> 00:30:09,155
[alarm continues]

548
00:30:09,198 --> 00:30:10,547
Don't you fucking move.

549
00:30:10,591 --> 00:30:11,897
You got him?
Are we good?

550
00:30:15,726 --> 00:30:17,816
[officer 1] Let's see how
you like some alone time, boy.

551
00:30:19,252 --> 00:30:20,601
Son of a bitch can bleed.

552
00:30:20,906 --> 00:30:22,603
[officer 2]
Ain't too pretty anymore.

553
00:30:24,518 --> 00:30:27,129
-Make him your bitch.
-[grunts]

554
00:30:28,478 --> 00:30:29,610
Pick his ass up.

555
00:30:30,741 --> 00:30:32,961
-Piece of shit.
-Come on, get up.

556
00:30:34,136 --> 00:30:36,051
"I'm sorry, boss", say it.

557
00:30:37,052 --> 00:30:37,966
Say it.

558
00:30:38,358 --> 00:30:40,708
[grunts, chokes]

559
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:44,190
[gasping, coughing]

560
00:30:47,584 --> 00:30:48,847
"I'm sorry, boss."

561
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:52,241
Say it.

562
00:30:53,677 --> 00:30:55,418
[wheezing]

563
00:31:08,431 --> 00:31:09,389
[door slams]

[groaning, sighing]

565
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:43,727
[cries]

566
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:47,470
What the fuck for?

567
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,006
[baby cooing]

568
00:32:01,658 --> 00:32:04,270
[shouting]

569
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:08,578
Y'all are treating me worse
than a damn animal!

570
00:32:09,014 --> 00:32:11,712
I wouldn't even treat my dog
like this.

571
00:32:13,105 --> 00:32:14,541
[Stacy]
Get the fuck out of here, Todd.

572
00:32:14,584 --> 00:32:15,890
Go back to the bar and find

573
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:16,847
some girl to suck on your dick.

574
00:32:16,891 --> 00:32:18,110
Get the fuck out of here.

575
00:32:18,588 --> 00:32:20,329
Get the fuck out of here, Todd.

576
00:32:20,677 --> 00:32:22,766
[Todd] Who are you
cheating on me with, bitch?

577
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:25,073
Everybody in the fucking town.
[grunts]

578
00:32:25,378 --> 00:32:27,206
-What's his name?
-The fuck up.

579
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:28,729
You fucking whore.

580
00:32:28,772 --> 00:32:30,339
Come on, Todd, that's enough.

581
00:32:31,297 --> 00:32:34,126
Come on, baby. I love you
so much, you know that.

582
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:37,825
See, you're not so bad.

583
00:32:38,347 --> 00:32:40,871
-Come on, baby, it's okay.
-Don't you move.

584
00:32:49,706 --> 00:32:52,535
Come over here, baby.
Come on.

585
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:56,322
[Todd]
We both fucked up and...

586
00:32:57,149 --> 00:32:58,672
you fucked up too.

587
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:03,633
[Amber] Daddy!

588
00:33:08,334 --> 00:33:10,205
Daddy!

-[fire whooshing]
-[shouting]

590
00:33:19,171 --> 00:33:21,303
Help! Help me!

591
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,061
Y'all, take me out of here.

592
00:33:44,674 --> 00:33:47,590
[sobs] I promise
I won't do anything bad again.

593
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,117
I promise I'll be good.

594
00:34:30,285 --> 00:34:33,375
Mr. Daniels, may I have a pen
and paper?

595
00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:34,507
Say please.

596
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,162
May I have a pen and paper,
please?

597
00:34:40,643 --> 00:34:42,776
May I have a pen and paper,
please, sir?

598
00:35:02,187 --> 00:35:06,582
Dear Stacy, I don't understand
why you won't come visit me.

599
00:35:07,235 --> 00:35:09,977
I've had a lot of time to think
about our life together.

600
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,241
"It already feels like
so long ago."

601
00:35:13,937 --> 00:35:15,765
Him again.
What's he want now?

602
00:35:15,809 --> 00:35:16,897
Grandma, lay off.

603
00:35:19,595 --> 00:35:20,466
[clears throat]

604
00:35:21,771 --> 00:35:23,599
"I have not been good.

605
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:26,994
I suppose I'm paying for that
now.

606
00:35:28,735 --> 00:35:29,736
But why sh...

607
00:35:31,085 --> 00:35:33,609
Why should I be punished
for a thing I did not do?

608
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:38,179
You know I would never hurt
those babies."

609
00:35:38,223 --> 00:35:39,920
You tell him to leave you be.

610
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:43,271
He was a wicked child
that became a wicked man.

611
00:35:43,315 --> 00:35:45,099
And if you'd figured that out
a little sooner,

612
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,840
I might still be a grandmother.

613
00:35:46,883 --> 00:35:48,537
If he killed anybody,
it would have been me.

614
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,149
You know what,

615
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:53,890
I'm gonna write a letter
to Governor Anne Richards

616
00:35:53,934 --> 00:35:55,022
and tell her how much he loved
his little girls.

617
00:35:55,065 --> 00:35:57,155
Well, that's just great, Stacy.

618
00:35:57,851 --> 00:35:59,505
I'm gonna go write a letter
to Santa.

619
00:36:13,214 --> 00:36:14,955
That's my favorite, Stacy.

620
00:36:15,434 --> 00:36:17,305
Oh, yeah? What a surprise.

621
00:36:20,743 --> 00:36:21,918
Who was that?

622
00:36:23,398 --> 00:36:25,879
You just look real nice
this time of day.

623
00:36:26,706 --> 00:36:27,968
Thank you, Todd.

624
00:36:29,361 --> 00:36:30,536
Wrote you a song.

625
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:32,625
Oh, yeah?
How does it go?

626
00:36:32,668 --> 00:36:35,497

-Sure, why not?

and sweet--

What are you doing, Todd?

639
00:37:12,491 --> 00:37:13,927
Come on,
you're just trying to show off.

640
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:15,276
One more time, come on.

-Come on.

You're like a 12-year-old boy.

643

[Stacy] I give in.

644
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,561
[Todd] Dear Stacy,

645
00:37:41,128 --> 00:37:42,912
I don't understand why you
won't answer my letters.

646
00:37:44,087 --> 00:37:46,002
I know you can never get over
what happened,

647
00:37:46,046 --> 00:37:47,874
but I lost everything, too.

648
00:37:48,483 --> 00:37:52,618
Not just the kids
and you and our home,

649
00:37:52,966 --> 00:37:55,055
but pretty soon now, my life.

650

-They have given the needle

We'll be praying for you.

[rhythmic banging]

657
00:38:19,122 --> 00:38:20,036
[Todd] I'd like to believe

658
00:38:21,386 --> 00:38:22,212
that even in a terrible place
like this

659
00:38:22,256 --> 00:38:23,170
there may be some good.

660
00:38:24,476 --> 00:38:26,521
But all I see is cruelty
and suffering.

661
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:28,915
Everybody pretty much hates it
the same.

662
00:38:30,395 --> 00:38:33,615
[man] ...And we will be raised
in pairs.

663
00:38:33,876 --> 00:38:36,314
And death will be swallowed
in victory.

-[officer] Come here.
-[man] Where's your victory?

665
00:38:39,404 --> 00:38:42,494
Death, where is--
will you let me fucking walk?

666
00:38:42,755 --> 00:38:44,800
-Will you let me fucking walk?
-Chill the fuck out.

Hey, white boy.

Yo, asshole!

What's your problem, man?
I'm talking to you.

You think I'm stupid
or something, boy?

676
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:10,391
Boy?

677
00:39:11,566 --> 00:39:13,089
-Come again?
-If I say anything to you,

678
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:14,961
you're gonna start saying
I confess some shit,

679
00:39:15,004 --> 00:39:16,963
get a reduced sentence,
fuck that!

680
00:39:17,006 --> 00:39:18,660
Hey, listen good, sugar.

681
00:39:20,053 --> 00:39:24,144
They get you here,
they got you good.

Huh, sweet thing?

684
00:39:30,455 --> 00:39:31,456
All right.

685
00:39:33,545 --> 00:39:35,285
I knocked over a jewelry store.

686
00:39:36,939 --> 00:39:38,288
Kind of hit a leak.

687
00:39:38,811 --> 00:39:41,161
Oh, God. He reached under
the counter for a piece

688
00:39:41,204 --> 00:39:43,772
and I shot him in the head.

689
00:39:46,906 --> 00:39:47,994
I was high.

690
00:39:49,735 --> 00:39:53,216
And I am guilty, but murder one,

691
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:56,568
shit, that is manslaughter
at the most.

692
00:39:57,264 --> 00:39:58,526
But this is Texas.

693
00:40:00,136 --> 00:40:03,052
[laughs] You know why they call
it capital punishment? Huh?

694
00:40:03,705 --> 00:40:06,273
Hey, you ain't got no capital,
you get punished.

695
00:40:06,316 --> 00:40:08,057
-That's right.
-[inmate] Shit.

696
00:40:08,536 --> 00:40:10,320
Now, don't tell me
that ain't your story too,

697
00:40:10,364 --> 00:40:13,323
because I know that sorry ass,
state-appointed lawyer of yours.

698
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:14,281
Huh?

699
00:40:15,674 --> 00:40:16,849
[inmate] Plumbers
ain't no different from lawyers.

700
00:40:16,892 --> 00:40:18,328
There's good ones
and there's bad ones.

701
00:40:18,372 --> 00:40:21,680
But you know what, poor folks
always get the bad ones.

702
00:40:22,376 --> 00:40:23,856
Just like my granddaddy
always said,

703
00:40:23,899 --> 00:40:26,554
everybody gets the same
amount of ice,

704
00:40:26,598 --> 00:40:28,774
except rich folks get it
in the summer.

705
00:40:29,078 --> 00:40:32,342
Of course, you could try to
become a cause célèbre

706
00:40:32,386 --> 00:40:33,343
or some such shit.

707
00:40:33,561 --> 00:40:35,911
Might even be worth some
publicity.

708
00:40:35,955 --> 00:40:38,566
You can get you one of them
fancy pants, white shoe boys

709
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:39,828
willing to do it for free.

710
00:40:39,872 --> 00:40:40,742
By the end,

711
00:40:42,265 --> 00:40:43,092
who knows if you got enough time
left to make a difference.

712
00:40:43,136 --> 00:40:44,790
-Hold up.
-[inmate] What?

713
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:47,314
You saying I can get me
a new lawyer with no money?

714
00:40:47,357 --> 00:40:50,317
Yeah, boy.
Now, you just write up a letter

715
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:54,321
about your situation and send it
to the Texas Equal Justice

716
00:40:54,364 --> 00:40:56,802
and that should do it.
That's initiative.

717
00:40:56,845 --> 00:41:01,110
I-N-I-T-I-A-T-I-V to the E.

718
00:41:01,154 --> 00:41:03,461
T-I-V to the E.

719
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,334
So, you say your previous
counsel,

720
00:41:07,377 --> 00:41:10,250
failed to capitalize
on numerous opportunities

721
00:41:10,293 --> 00:41:12,208
to reach the prosecutions'
witnesses?

722
00:41:12,861 --> 00:41:15,385
Or to present any viable
alternative

723
00:41:15,908 --> 00:41:17,997
to their theories of your
culpability?

724
00:41:20,608 --> 00:41:21,914
He did a shit sorry job.

725
00:41:22,654 --> 00:41:23,698
Sold you down the river.

726
00:41:25,744 --> 00:41:27,354
This is your trial transcript.

727
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:31,619
And just a few books,
might be helpful.

728
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:33,403
Homework.

729
00:41:34,666 --> 00:41:36,363
I'm preparing
a writ of habeas corpus,

730
00:41:36,406 --> 00:41:38,060
also known as "The great writ."

731
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:40,585
We're allowed to present
new evidence,

732
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:42,369
if we can find some, that is.

733
00:41:43,022 --> 00:41:46,939
Do you have any, you know,
resources to help us?

734
00:41:47,374 --> 00:41:49,637
Someone who'll pay
for a private investigator?

735
00:41:49,681 --> 00:41:52,118
Your wife or family?

736
00:41:52,161 --> 00:41:53,989
-No, sir.
-All right.

737
00:41:54,816 --> 00:41:56,252
Well, we'll figure something
out.

738
00:41:57,906 --> 00:41:59,560
We need to find something
in your trial

739
00:41:59,604 --> 00:42:00,953
that demonstrates negligence.

740
00:42:01,431 --> 00:42:03,303
That's harder to do
once you've been convicted.

741
00:42:03,912 --> 00:42:05,523
I need you to go through
the transcript

742
00:42:06,001 --> 00:42:07,525
and find anything questionable.

743
00:42:07,786 --> 00:42:09,091
Okay, can you do that?

744
00:42:10,571 --> 00:42:12,921
I think I'll squeeze it
into my very hectic schedule.

745
00:42:14,706 --> 00:42:17,535
This writ could be your last
chance.

746
00:42:18,231 --> 00:42:19,580
And a slim one at that.

747
00:42:26,631 --> 00:42:30,548
Hey, Metallica. I can
practically hear you reading.

748
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,812
Give that a rest,
let me beat you at Crazy Eights.

749
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,465
This is making my head hurt.

750
00:42:35,509 --> 00:42:36,858
They make it that way
on purpose.

751
00:42:36,902 --> 00:42:38,251
Keep out dummies
like us.

752
00:42:38,294 --> 00:42:40,079
There's some crazy ass words
in here, bro.

753
00:42:40,601 --> 00:42:43,909
-Contemptuous, colloquially.
-[laughs] Spell that shit

754
00:42:43,952 --> 00:42:45,519
-without looking.
-Analogous.

755
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,695
-Did I even say it right?
-[chuckles]

756
00:42:48,087 --> 00:42:49,784
-Meticulous.
-Uh-huh.

757
00:42:49,828 --> 00:42:50,916
Interwoven.

758
00:42:52,178 --> 00:42:53,005
Now, I'm gonna drop
some knowledge for you.

759
00:42:54,223 --> 00:42:56,704
That first appeal,
it might not go nowhere.

760
00:42:57,096 --> 00:42:58,184
They ain't gonna overturn

761
00:42:58,227 --> 00:42:59,620
their hunting buddy's
conviction.

762
00:42:59,664 --> 00:43:01,840
You might have a chance
with the Fifth Circuit.

763
00:43:01,883 --> 00:43:03,624
What about this Supreme Court
shit?

764
00:43:03,668 --> 00:43:05,887
You kidding? If it leans
any more to the right

765
00:43:05,931 --> 00:43:06,932
it'll tip over.

766
00:43:08,107 --> 00:43:09,108
These books
keep talking about justice

767
00:43:09,151 --> 00:43:10,239
like it's something real.

768
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:12,198
[inmate] Man, there ain't
no justice in the system.

769
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,027
And there ain't none in this
life, either.

770
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:19,118
You know, why was I born black?

771
00:43:20,206 --> 00:43:21,076
Hmm?

772
00:43:21,729 --> 00:43:23,078
Yeah, black as hell.

773
00:43:23,644 --> 00:43:25,777
And why was y'all born poor
and stupid?

774
00:43:26,038 --> 00:43:27,648
Can't I be born poor and smart?

775
00:43:27,692 --> 00:43:29,607
[inmate] No, man,
it's a lie, bro.

776
00:43:30,695 --> 00:43:32,522
What if somebody
really is innocent?

777
00:43:32,566 --> 00:43:34,002
It ain't got nothing to do
with it.

778
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:37,963
Death penalty's good politics.

779
00:43:39,181 --> 00:43:40,922
As a matter of fact,
in an election year,

780
00:43:40,966 --> 00:43:42,794
they always kill
twice as many of us.

781
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:44,839
That's politics for your ass.

782
00:43:44,883 --> 00:43:46,449
-For real?
-Yeah.

783
00:43:46,493 --> 00:43:49,888
Your candy ass politicians feel
like real men killing folks.

784
00:43:49,931 --> 00:43:51,280
Take your hand, bro.

867
00:48:59,632 --> 00:49:00,633
Hey.

868
00:49:01,895 --> 00:49:03,114
You need some help?

869
00:49:05,551 --> 00:49:06,987
So, are you from around here?

870
00:49:11,078 --> 00:49:12,558
Why'd you stop back there?

871
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,518
Oh, I didn't think you were
dangerous.

872
00:49:17,128 --> 00:49:19,260
Figured I could take you
one on one.

873
00:49:22,002 --> 00:49:23,221
You weren't scared?

874
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:26,137
-What?
-You weren't scared?

875
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:28,791
Of you? Why?

876
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,141
Why not?

877
00:49:32,665 --> 00:49:34,536
I guess I just didn't think
about it.

878
00:49:35,668 --> 00:49:37,104
[waitress] Thank you so much.

879
00:49:37,148 --> 00:49:38,584
Oh, thank you.

880
00:49:38,627 --> 00:49:40,107
Can't you stay a moment more?

881
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:43,545
You might be just the kind
of person we're looking for.

882
00:49:44,503 --> 00:49:47,549
Oh, you're scared now?

883
00:49:48,942 --> 00:49:52,859
Well, I'm a little weirded out,
to tell you the truth.

884
00:49:53,773 --> 00:49:55,775
-What you want from me?
-Your address.

885
00:49:56,471 --> 00:49:58,821
-What for?
-I wanna send you something.

886
00:49:58,865 --> 00:50:00,562
Oh, you don't need to
send me anything.

887
00:50:00,606 --> 00:50:02,347
Well, I wanna return the favor.

888
00:50:02,825 --> 00:50:05,002
I think you and I were intended
to meet.

889
00:50:06,264 --> 00:50:09,049
So, was she, like,
a crazy person or--

890
00:50:09,093 --> 00:50:10,964
Why did she want
your address?

891
00:50:11,312 --> 00:50:15,447
Well, she said somebody might
wanna write me a letter.

892
00:50:15,708 --> 00:50:17,362
-Who?
-A prisoner.

893
00:50:18,798 --> 00:50:20,495
-What?
-Nothing.

894
00:50:20,539 --> 00:50:23,063
-[Elizabeth] What?
-Just classic Liz.

895
00:50:23,107 --> 00:50:25,805
-Oh, here we go.
-The abandoned kittens,

896
00:50:26,066 --> 00:50:28,155
the homeless family
at the truck stop.

897
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:29,504
[Elizabeth] Oh, my God.
[chuckles]

898
00:50:29,548 --> 00:50:31,419
The starving African kids
on TV.

899
00:50:31,463 --> 00:50:34,422
-Okay. Gullible, bleeding heart.
-Oh, I'm not saying that.

900
00:50:34,466 --> 00:50:35,858
You called me St. Liz
for a decade.

901
00:50:35,902 --> 00:50:37,730
Well, that's not what I think.

902
00:50:39,123 --> 00:50:41,603
We're well past lying, George,
aren't we?

903
00:50:43,605 --> 00:50:46,565
So, yesterday, I got a letter.

904
00:50:46,608 --> 00:50:49,307
-Hey, Mom.
-Hey, girl, how was school?

905
00:50:50,569 --> 00:50:51,918
Earth to Julie.

906
00:50:52,788 --> 00:50:55,052
-Sorry?
-Never mind.

907
00:50:55,095 --> 00:50:56,618
-Love you.
-Love you, too.

908
00:50:58,359 --> 00:51:04,061
And it said, "Dear Ms. Gilbert,
I got your address from TCADP.

909
00:51:04,104 --> 00:51:07,803
I was told that you might be
willing to correspond

910
00:51:08,369 --> 00:51:10,458
with someone such as myself."

911
00:51:10,502 --> 00:51:12,808
What is that, the TAD,
whatever?

912
00:51:12,852 --> 00:51:13,983
[Elizabeth] TCADP.

913
00:51:15,289 --> 00:51:17,030
Texas Coalition
to Abolish the Death Penalty.

914
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,292
How'd you get involved in that?

915
00:51:18,336 --> 00:51:20,729
The lady who asked
for my address.

916
00:51:21,382 --> 00:51:23,689
-You don't listen to me.
-No, I was listening.

917
00:51:23,732 --> 00:51:25,430
-What did he do?
-Never mind.

918
00:51:25,473 --> 00:51:27,649
Oh, come on, Liz
Come on.

919
00:51:27,693 --> 00:51:29,086
Why is he on death row?

920
00:51:29,477 --> 00:51:30,609
He...

921
00:51:32,045 --> 00:51:34,265
He burned down his house
with his kids inside.

922
00:51:34,308 --> 00:51:36,136
-That's charming.
-[scoffs]

923
00:51:36,702 --> 00:51:39,270
-All right. Here.
-[coughing]

924
00:51:45,145 --> 00:51:47,669
So, why exactly
are you doing this?

925
00:51:47,713 --> 00:51:49,280
I didn't say I was doing it.

926
00:51:49,323 --> 00:51:50,803
But you're thinking about it.

927
00:51:51,195 --> 00:51:55,286
Well, can't I just not know?
I don't know.

928
00:51:55,329 --> 00:51:58,593
Isn't looking after one person
with a death sentence enough?

929
00:52:02,293 --> 00:52:04,251
-[sighs]
-I'm sorry.

930
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:10,605
So, are you and the kids okay?
Money and everything.

931
00:52:11,606 --> 00:52:13,086
-Yeah.
-Well, if you need anything,

932
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,393
-just...
-Your check comes on time.

933
00:52:16,916 --> 00:52:18,570
And we talked all that out.

934
00:52:20,789 --> 00:52:22,748
-[sighs]
-I failed you, Liz.

935
00:52:23,836 --> 00:52:25,359
And yet, you're here for me.

936
00:52:26,578 --> 00:52:28,449
If thing's were the other way
around,

937
00:52:29,102 --> 00:52:30,625
would I be there for you?

938
00:52:32,845 --> 00:52:34,803
Do we get off that sow
or just admit the truth?

939
00:52:38,851 --> 00:52:39,895
How are you...

940
00:52:41,332 --> 00:52:42,246
really?

941
00:52:49,557 --> 00:52:51,559
-Mama, you forgot the milk.
-[sighs]

942
00:52:51,603 --> 00:52:53,692
-I'm going to the market later.
-Okay.

943
00:52:53,735 --> 00:52:55,998
-Mom, what are reading there?
-Letter from a guy in jail

944
00:52:56,042 --> 00:52:57,174
-who kills babies.
-Julie.

945
00:52:58,653 --> 00:52:59,915
What, are you writing
a play about him or something?

946
00:52:59,959 --> 00:53:02,527
No, sweetie, there's a man
who is in prison--

947
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:04,616
-He wants Mama to visit him.
-Seriously?

948
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:07,793
A lot of people visit inmates,
and I'm not saying that I'm--

949
00:53:07,836 --> 00:53:09,925
You know they're gonna poison
him to death, right?

950
00:53:09,969 --> 00:53:12,058
-He deserves it.
-You got somewhere to be,

951
00:53:12,101 --> 00:53:13,886
like, school, and maybe
clean your mess up?

952
00:53:13,929 --> 00:53:15,322
Mama, I know
what the death penalty is--

953
00:53:15,366 --> 00:53:16,976
I can't believe you're actually
thinking about

954
00:53:17,019 --> 00:53:18,020
visiting a murderer.

955
00:53:18,064 --> 00:53:19,152
-I didn't say--
-That is so gross.

956
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,153
I didn't say he was innocent.

957
00:53:21,589 --> 00:53:22,634
-Okay, then what are you saying?
-He's a human being.

958
00:53:23,852 --> 00:53:25,463
Okay, I'm late.
Dave's gonna drop me.

959
00:53:25,506 --> 00:53:27,029
So, are you seeing your dad,
later?

960
00:53:27,378 --> 00:53:28,553
No, the Gremlins will be there.

961
00:53:28,596 --> 00:53:30,772
Well, they are your
brother and sister.

962
00:53:32,296 --> 00:53:33,253
What?

963
00:53:33,775 --> 00:53:34,994
Fine. I'll go.

964
00:53:35,429 --> 00:53:36,822
All right.
Am I getting you later?

965
00:53:36,865 --> 00:53:38,258
[Julie] No,
Dave's gonna drive me.

966
00:53:38,302 --> 00:53:39,868
Well, will you call me,
please, miss?

967
00:53:39,912 --> 00:53:41,174
Mom, I got soccer practice
till 6:00

968
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,784
-and I'm taking the bus.
-Okay, well I thought

969
00:53:42,828 --> 00:53:44,003
-I was getting you.
-[Andrew] Bye.

970
00:53:44,046 --> 00:53:45,222
What about oatmeal?

971
00:53:48,921 --> 00:53:51,489
[Todd] Death row inmates
aren't allowed to associate

972
00:53:51,532 --> 00:53:53,142
with the general population.

973
00:53:54,056 --> 00:53:56,798
We have no contact at all
with the outside.

974
00:53:56,842 --> 00:53:59,236
No one in the whole world knows
I exist.

975
00:53:59,801 --> 00:54:02,239
I feel like I'm slowly being
erased.

976
00:54:04,284 --> 00:54:05,677
Please excuse my writing,

977
00:54:06,678 --> 00:54:08,723
I'm learning to express myself
better.

978
00:54:09,898 --> 00:54:11,900
I've added your name
to my visitor's list

979
00:54:11,944 --> 00:54:13,467
in case you
decide to come.

980
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,992
Meantime, I hope your
life turns forever forward.

981
00:54:17,602 --> 00:54:19,647
Yours, Cameron Todd Willingham.

982
00:54:33,792 --> 00:54:35,750
[indistinct chatter]

983
00:54:36,011 --> 00:54:37,926
[scanner buzzing]

984
00:54:40,233 --> 00:54:42,975
Hello, sir, I'm here to see
Cameron Todd Willingham.

985
00:54:49,895 --> 00:54:50,983
Come, miss.

986
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,226
Thank you for coming,
Mrs. Gilbert.

987
00:55:17,879 --> 00:55:19,098
It's really nice to meet you.

988
00:55:19,141 --> 00:55:21,013
Oh, nice to meet you too,
Cameron.

989
00:55:21,405 --> 00:55:22,754
Folks call me Todd.

990
00:55:23,494 --> 00:55:25,365
Oh, yeah? Todd.

991
00:55:25,713 --> 00:55:28,063
I really appreciate you
coming all this way.

992
00:55:29,935 --> 00:55:31,893
-You're in Houston, right?
-Yeah.

993
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,157
-How was the drive?
-Oh, it was fine.

994
00:55:35,201 --> 00:55:39,510
Well, some traffic, you know,
Houston Freeway has become...

995
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:42,730
crazy.

996
00:55:44,732 --> 00:55:48,170
You know, you're my first
visitor in a long time.

997
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:49,781
Am I?

998
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:52,218
Well, good.

999
00:55:53,132 --> 00:55:55,917
I guess. And why is that?

1000
00:55:58,137 --> 00:56:02,489
-I...
-I mean, your wife comes?

1001
00:56:03,272 --> 00:56:05,187
No, Stacy and me
ain't together no more.

1002
00:56:05,231 --> 00:56:06,232
Oh...

1003
00:56:07,015 --> 00:56:09,148
I guess I understand,
it's just...

1004
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:13,370
I miss her, is all.

1005
00:56:15,023 --> 00:56:16,111
Sorry.

1006
00:56:17,635 --> 00:56:19,114
How about your folks?

1007
00:56:20,028 --> 00:56:21,465
They're in Oklahoma, ma'am.

1008
00:56:22,727 --> 00:56:24,206
It's 200 miles each way.

1009
00:56:26,426 --> 00:56:27,775
And my folks is old.

1010
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,821
And my mom's ailing, so...

1011
00:56:31,997 --> 00:56:33,259
They come when they can.

1012
00:56:35,479 --> 00:56:38,177
Well, how about you tell me
about...

1013
00:56:39,483 --> 00:56:42,311
your life here,
what it's like or...

1014
00:56:42,355 --> 00:56:45,358
-Not much to tell, really.
-Mm, right.

1015
00:56:47,142 --> 00:56:49,797
Any comforts or, I don't know?

1016
00:56:50,537 --> 00:56:51,582
In jail?

1017
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:53,758
No, ma'am.

1018
00:56:56,848 --> 00:57:00,417
I'm sorry, Todd.
I don't know-- I don't know...

1019
00:57:01,113 --> 00:57:03,376
what to ask or how to...

1020
00:57:04,986 --> 00:57:10,078
If I-- If I--
If I make it harder to talk.

1021
00:57:10,122 --> 00:57:15,127
No, ma'am. How about you?
Tell me about the outside world.

1022
00:57:16,563 --> 00:57:18,609
Maybe I can get out
of this place for a while.

1023
00:57:19,261 --> 00:57:22,482
Oh, all right, sure.

1024
00:57:22,526 --> 00:57:25,790
But maybe you call me Elizabeth,
because when you say ma'am,

1025
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:28,096
it makes me feel like
you're talking to my mama.

1026
00:57:31,012 --> 00:57:32,536
-Elizabeth.
-Okay.

1027
00:57:33,014 --> 00:57:36,583
Well, um... let's see.

1028
00:57:37,628 --> 00:57:40,761
-You married?
-Me? Divorced, actually.

1029
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,676
-Kids?
-Two.

1030
00:57:43,851 --> 00:57:45,331
Andrew and Julie.

1031
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:47,507
-Boy and a girl.
-Yeah.

1032
00:57:47,551 --> 00:57:49,988
-That's nice.
-Yeah, yeah.

1033
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:55,384
My big girl, Amber,
she'd be 11 by now.

1034
00:57:58,562 --> 00:58:00,868
And Karmen and Kameron,
they'd be nine.

1035
00:58:01,565 --> 00:58:02,783
They was twins.

1036
00:58:04,306 --> 00:58:06,395
Twins? Oof!

1037
00:58:06,831 --> 00:58:09,181
-That's something, huh?
-Yes, ma'am.

1038
00:58:09,224 --> 00:58:10,225
Elizabeth.

1039
00:58:11,444 --> 00:58:14,012
Oh, you ever tried
diapering two at once?

1040
00:58:14,055 --> 00:58:15,230
-No.
-Oo-ee.

1041
00:58:15,883 --> 00:58:17,929
Stacy used to say it was like
trying to

1042
00:58:17,972 --> 00:58:19,931
grab a hold of two little
greased piggies

1043
00:58:19,974 --> 00:58:21,454
at the state fair.

1044
00:58:31,072 --> 00:58:33,771
Oh, they was the most beautiful
babies in the whole world.

1045
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:42,954
They're all different,
but cut from the same cloth.

1046
00:58:44,956 --> 00:58:46,958
Now, Kameron, she was smart.

1047
00:58:47,001 --> 00:58:49,526
She had, like,
a routine that she stuck to.

1048
00:58:50,439 --> 00:58:52,877
And if anybody disturbed it,
and she didn't like it,

1049
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,879
she would let the whole of Texas
know about it.

1050
00:58:54,922 --> 00:58:57,403
Karmen, she was--
She was more like me.

1051
00:58:57,969 --> 00:59:00,319
And Amber, she was a great
big sister.

1052
00:59:00,362 --> 00:59:03,714
She went from redecorating
her sister's room to...

1053
00:59:04,932 --> 00:59:07,456
turning around to me one time,
and saying, "Daddy,

1054
00:59:07,718 --> 00:59:11,112
I love the new babies, but when
are they going home now?"

1055
00:59:11,156 --> 00:59:12,287
[Elizabeth chuckles]

1056
00:59:22,907 --> 00:59:25,039
Gosh, I tell you
I wanna hear about the world

1057
00:59:25,083 --> 00:59:26,737
and I end up doing
all the talking.

1058
00:59:27,128 --> 00:59:28,477
Oh, that's fine.

1059
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:32,307
Well, I'm sorry.
I guess, it's just been a while.

1060
00:59:33,352 --> 00:59:34,832
How long has it been?

1061
00:59:35,528 --> 00:59:38,749
-Eight years.
-Hey.

1062
00:59:41,316 --> 00:59:43,362
We're pretty much
at the end of the line now.

1063
00:59:46,234 --> 00:59:47,540
You scared, Todd?

1064
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:50,717
I did not kill my own children,
Elizabeth.

1065
00:59:52,414 --> 00:59:53,459
I swear.

1066
00:59:54,765 --> 00:59:57,115
I love them more
than I love life itself.

1067
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,465
-[door rattles]
-[officer] Time's up.

1068
01:00:20,181 --> 01:00:23,750
It was weird.
He was gentle and soft spoken.

1069
01:00:23,794 --> 01:00:25,970
Oh, that's because he wants to
get in your pants.

1070
01:00:26,013 --> 01:00:27,754
-You know that's true.
-That's rude.

1071
01:00:27,798 --> 01:00:30,539
And he was a devil worshiper
to boot!

1072
01:00:30,583 --> 01:00:31,671
No!

1073
01:00:31,715 --> 01:00:34,369
-No.
-No, I heard it right on the TV.

1074
01:00:34,761 --> 01:00:38,765
He burned up those babies
as a sacrifice to Satan himself.

1075
01:00:39,113 --> 01:00:41,202
[Elizabeth] Seriously? Girls,
you're getting out of control.

1076
01:00:41,246 --> 01:00:43,291
If anybody were to come near
my babies,

1077
01:00:43,335 --> 01:00:46,033
I got a .38 Colt by my bedside
with their name on it.

1078
01:00:46,077 --> 01:00:48,340
The idea of you
with your loaded .38

1079
01:00:48,383 --> 01:00:50,255
makes me wanna move out
of the neighborhood.

1080
01:00:50,298 --> 01:00:51,952
[chuckling, indistinct chatter]

1081
01:00:51,996 --> 01:00:53,301
Let's get started.

1082
01:00:54,912 --> 01:00:56,435
Are you gonna use some of this
for your new play, as if...

1083
01:00:56,478 --> 01:00:58,698
-Oh, I don't know.
-Fascinating.

1084
01:00:58,742 --> 01:01:02,528
Liz, wha-- What if somebody
was trying to hurt your babies?

1085
01:01:02,571 --> 01:01:03,747
I'd do anything.

1086
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:05,400
-See?
-That's not the point.

1087
01:01:05,444 --> 01:01:07,968
-Of course, it is.
-It's still taking a life.

1088
01:01:08,012 --> 01:01:09,970
A monster
who don't deserve to live.

1089
01:01:10,231 --> 01:01:11,842
It's just revenge.

1090
01:01:11,885 --> 01:01:15,236
I mean, are we still there?
Isn't that a primitive idea?

1091
01:01:15,541 --> 01:01:18,457
No. It's called restitution.

1092
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,067
Let the punishment
fit the crime.

1093
01:01:20,415 --> 01:01:22,679
Okay, well, you better kill
your ex-husband.

1094
01:01:22,722 --> 01:01:24,332
Oh, wouldn't that be great?

1095
01:01:26,204 --> 01:01:29,642
Liz, don't become one of those
sad women we hear about,

1096
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,689
-who falls in love with--
-Me?

1097
01:01:32,732 --> 01:01:33,777
I'm just saying.

1098
01:01:35,256 --> 01:01:37,824
Thank you so much for
your interest in my love life.

1099
01:01:38,085 --> 01:01:40,435
But don't worry,
even someone as desperate as me

1100
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:42,916
knows that a death row romance
doesn't have a future.

1101
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,963
[chuckling, chattering]

1102
01:01:47,747 --> 01:01:48,748
Hey.

1103
01:02:02,109 --> 01:02:03,197
Dad died.

1104
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:14,208
[crickets chirping]

1105
01:02:22,434 --> 01:02:23,652
[Todd] Dear Elizabeth,

1106
01:02:25,176 --> 01:02:26,525
I didn't get a chance to
express my deep gratitude

1107
01:02:26,568 --> 01:02:27,569
for your visit.

1108
01:02:28,266 --> 01:02:30,398
It lifted my spirits for days.

1109
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:36,709
Sir?

1110
01:02:49,983 --> 01:02:51,550
I used to be full of hate.

1111
01:02:51,898 --> 01:02:54,292
Hate for the judge,
hate for the jury.

1112
01:02:54,596 --> 01:02:56,076
Hate for everyone
who mistreated

1113
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:57,556
me and wanted me dead.

1114
01:02:58,731 --> 01:03:00,298
I guess after all this time,

1115
01:03:00,341 --> 01:03:02,604
the hate just kinda
burned out of me.

1116
01:03:03,388 --> 01:03:06,478
I've been working hard
on my case and...

1117
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:08,132
it's funny,

1118
01:03:08,175 --> 01:03:10,438
I'm no longer the same dumb
24-year-old

1119
01:03:10,482 --> 01:03:12,223
who lost his place
in the world...

1120
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,880
and have achieved more learning
within these walls

1121
01:03:16,923 --> 01:03:18,403
than I ever did in school.

1122
01:03:22,015 --> 01:03:24,452
I can remember every word
of our conversation.

1123
01:03:25,366 --> 01:03:27,804
You're the kind of person
I never had the chance to meet.

1124
01:03:28,282 --> 01:03:29,327
An artist,

1125
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:33,026
filled with intellectual ideas,
and worldly wisdom.

1126
01:03:34,027 --> 01:03:37,378
"For me, it was more than
a connection to a world.

1127
01:03:37,422 --> 01:03:38,989
It brought my heart to laugh,

1128
01:03:39,032 --> 01:03:42,427
and created an omni-potent glow
around my being."

1129
01:03:43,341 --> 01:03:45,169
Sounds like he's prepping
for the SATs.

1130
01:03:45,212 --> 01:03:47,606
Mm-hmm. Well, first of all,
it's omnipotent.

1131
01:03:48,041 --> 01:03:51,131
And secondly, maybe he's just
trying to improve himself.

1132
01:03:52,045 --> 01:03:55,048
I mean, there's other people we
know who might wanna, like,

1133
01:03:55,353 --> 01:03:58,095
-study for the SATs.
-I'm studying!

1134
01:04:02,447 --> 01:04:03,796
You wanna visit him again?

1135
01:04:04,797 --> 01:04:07,234
Is this like a... a thing?

1136
01:04:08,757 --> 01:04:09,758
I might.

1137
01:04:10,585 --> 01:04:11,456
Why?

1138
01:04:13,806 --> 01:04:15,068
I don't know, honey.

1139
01:04:18,419 --> 01:04:21,858
You know, when you just wanna
do something...

1140
01:04:25,644 --> 01:04:26,645
help...

1141
01:04:28,212 --> 01:04:29,996
somebody who's feeling...

1142
01:04:31,737 --> 01:04:33,347
so much, you know?

1143
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:39,005
I don't know what I'm saying.
Am I making any sense?

1144
01:04:39,049 --> 01:04:40,050
Honestly...

1145
01:04:41,442 --> 01:04:42,400
not really.

1146
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,993
I cannot believe you came back.

1147
01:05:10,036 --> 01:05:11,081
I sure did.

1148
01:05:12,082 --> 01:05:13,257
Look at you.

1149
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,041
So pretty.

1150
01:05:15,302 --> 01:05:17,000
You don't have to say that,
Todd.

1151
01:05:17,043 --> 01:05:18,175
Are you kidding me?

1152
01:05:19,828 --> 01:05:21,352
Look at your hair, your eyes,
your dress, everything's just...

1153
01:05:21,395 --> 01:05:23,702
mm-mm, singin' to me.

1154
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:25,051
Okay.

1155
01:05:26,052 --> 01:05:28,576
Stand up for me.
Just give me a twirl.

1156
01:05:28,881 --> 01:05:30,927
-What?
-Come on, now. Just once.

1157
01:05:32,189 --> 01:05:33,277
Now, come on.

1158
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:34,626
No.

1159
01:05:37,194 --> 01:05:38,238
How you been?

1160
01:05:39,022 --> 01:05:41,894
Liz, last time you came,

1161
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,678
I was the one
who did all the talking.

1162
01:05:43,983 --> 01:05:46,116
How are the kids?
Julie and Andrew, right?

1163
01:05:46,159 --> 01:05:47,160
Yeah.

1164
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,162
They're okay.

1165
01:05:49,858 --> 01:05:51,469
Hmm. I told you their ages?

1166
01:05:51,512 --> 01:05:52,557
No.

1167
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,689
-Um, Julie is 17.
-Uh-oh.

1168
01:05:54,733 --> 01:05:55,734
Super smart.

1169
01:05:56,039 --> 01:05:58,258
She's a great kid, but...

1170
01:05:58,867 --> 01:06:00,782
she's a pain in my butt
sometimes.

1171
01:06:00,826 --> 01:06:03,263
-[chuckles]
-Oh, my Lord.

1172
01:06:03,655 --> 01:06:06,049
Well, you wouldn't wanna know me
when I was 17.

1173
01:06:06,092 --> 01:06:08,660
-Believe me. Uh-uh.
-Oh, no kidding?

1174
01:06:10,183 --> 01:06:12,838
-And Andrew?
-Best freckles known to man.

1175
01:06:12,881 --> 01:06:14,927
-Is he breaking hearts?
-On the cusp.

1176
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,146
They get to see their daddy
much?

1177
01:06:19,584 --> 01:06:20,628
What's wrong?

1178
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:23,675
Their dad died
a couple of weeks ago.

1179
01:06:24,328 --> 01:06:25,503
Oh, I'm sorry.

1180
01:06:26,808 --> 01:06:28,810
I'm sorry to hear
about your loss.

1181
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:33,076
I guess, we both know what it is
to lose something now.

1182
01:06:38,472 --> 01:06:40,953
I wrote a poem about my babies.
It's pretty bad.

1183
01:06:41,171 --> 01:06:42,476
You wanna hear it?

1184
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:43,651
Sure, of course.

1185
01:06:47,394 --> 01:06:48,395
It's bad.

1186
01:06:50,832 --> 01:06:53,705
"I know their beauty flows
deep within.

1187
01:06:54,836 --> 01:06:57,404
And all that's broken
their love will mend.

1188
01:06:58,188 --> 01:07:00,668
This beauty of theirs
is so unique.

1189
01:07:01,495 --> 01:07:04,324
It's much more valuable
than priceless antiques."

1190
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:06,631
Nice.

1191
01:07:07,849 --> 01:07:10,896
-Fucking terrible, huh?
-[laughs]

1192
01:07:11,201 --> 01:07:14,117
It's terrible. [laughs]

1193
01:07:16,858 --> 01:07:19,383
[man over PA] All sections,
call count, five minutes,

1194
01:07:19,426 --> 01:07:20,949
clear your ranks,
clear the cages.

1195
01:07:20,993 --> 01:07:21,994
[buzzer sounds]

1196
01:07:25,606 --> 01:07:27,260
You're a Cowboys fan, right?

1197
01:07:28,087 --> 01:07:29,045
Yeah.

1198
01:07:30,394 --> 01:07:32,265
You think Aikman and Irving
have still got it?

1199
01:07:32,787 --> 01:07:34,920
You almost done?
It's fucking freezing out here.

1200
01:07:35,529 --> 01:07:37,444
Figured out why
you're always pissed.

1201
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:39,272
Yeah, why's that?

1202
01:07:39,316 --> 01:07:41,666
Because you're a prisoner here,
too, like me.

1203
01:07:41,709 --> 01:07:43,320
You ain't bottom of the pile.

1204
01:07:43,972 --> 01:07:45,713
You ain't top of the pile,
neither.

1205
01:07:46,366 --> 01:07:47,672
You're just kinda
middle of the pile.

1206
01:07:47,715 --> 01:07:50,501
-[laughs]
-Now, in order to feel like

1207
01:07:50,544 --> 01:07:51,893
you're going somewhere
in the world,

1208
01:07:51,937 --> 01:07:53,939
you got to stand on
the likes of me.

1209
01:07:55,897 --> 01:07:57,203
But don't really get you
anywhere,

1210
01:07:57,247 --> 01:07:58,683
you just kinda stay
in the middle.

1211
01:07:58,726 --> 01:07:59,814
Yeah?

1212
01:07:59,858 --> 01:08:01,338
You my fucking therapist now?

1213
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,299
I just got a lot of time
on my hands is all.

1214
01:08:10,042 --> 01:08:12,871
You ever read
Man's Search for Meaning?

1215
01:08:14,612 --> 01:08:15,874
I was absent that day.

1216
01:08:16,309 --> 01:08:17,876
It's by Viktor E. Frankl.

1217
01:08:20,183 --> 01:08:22,446
-Okay.
-Yeah, the guy basically says...

1218
01:08:23,186 --> 01:08:25,536
"To live is to suffer.

1219
01:08:27,451 --> 01:08:30,193
And to survive, you got to find
meaning in the suffering."

1220
01:08:33,544 --> 01:08:35,198
I made a promise to my daughter.

1221
01:08:37,069 --> 01:08:38,636
She visits me sometimes.

1222
01:08:41,987 --> 01:08:43,467
You got a daughter too, right?

1223
01:08:46,644 --> 01:08:47,862
What's her name again?

1224
01:08:49,037 --> 01:08:50,038
Becky.

1225
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:52,128
Let's go inside.

1226
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:58,699
No need to cuff your bitch ass.

1227
01:08:58,743 --> 01:09:00,484
Are you sure?
I'm feeling dangerous, brother.

1228
01:09:00,527 --> 01:09:02,529
-Yeah, you ain't got shit.
-[Todd laughs]

1229
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,271
[Todd] How you been?

1230
01:09:07,926 --> 01:09:08,927
Yeah?

1231
01:09:11,364 --> 01:09:12,713
Been doing much?

1232
01:09:17,196 --> 01:09:18,328
This is you.

1233
01:09:20,939 --> 01:09:22,854
Don't really look like you,
though, huh?

1234
01:09:25,291 --> 01:09:27,119
I might have to give her
a haircut.

1235
01:09:28,338 --> 01:09:29,730
Are you seeing your sisters?

1236
01:09:30,688 --> 01:09:31,689
They good?

1237
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:34,735
Are you mad at me?

1238
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:38,522
Are you mad at me?

1239
01:09:43,527 --> 01:09:44,658
You still see them?

1240
01:09:45,833 --> 01:09:47,487
Yeah, you taking care of them?

1241
01:09:48,314 --> 01:09:49,315
Yeah?

1242
01:09:51,099 --> 01:09:52,753
You gonna tell them
you saw Daddy?

1243
01:09:54,233 --> 01:09:55,756
You gonna tell them I'm sorry?

1244
01:10:02,981 --> 01:10:04,983
You know I didn't do it,
don't you?

1245
01:10:14,688 --> 01:10:16,081
[Elizabeth] Well, Todd,

1246
01:10:16,124 --> 01:10:18,431
you want to hear
about my life, so here goes.

1247
01:10:19,127 --> 01:10:20,868
You probably didn't want this
much detail,

1248
01:10:20,912 --> 01:10:23,306
but you did say
you wanted to know everything.

1249
01:10:25,873 --> 01:10:27,005
Mornings are tough.

1250
01:10:27,701 --> 01:10:28,702
Morning.

1251
01:10:30,138 --> 01:10:30,878
Teenagers think
they can stay up all night.

1252
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:32,619
Then they seemed

1253
01:10:32,663 --> 01:10:34,012
surprised when they have
to wake up for school.

1254
01:10:37,015 --> 01:10:38,843
I probably coddle
them too much,

1255
01:10:38,886 --> 01:10:41,149
but that's my
right as a mother.

1256
01:10:42,847 --> 01:10:44,240
Well, it's just me now.

1257
01:10:44,675 --> 01:10:46,764
I guess I want them to know
I'm there for them.

1258
01:10:48,722 --> 01:10:52,422
Hey, hey, didn't you need me
to sign

1259
01:10:52,465 --> 01:10:54,511
that signature page
for you?

1260
01:10:54,772 --> 01:10:55,903
But I tell you...

1261
01:10:56,469 --> 01:10:58,558
sometimes that hour between

1262
01:10:58,602 --> 01:11:00,647
6:00 and 7:00 in the morning

1263
01:11:01,039 --> 01:11:02,649
feels about five minutes long.

1264
01:11:02,954 --> 01:11:05,304
-Lunch. Is that enough, though?
-Yeah.

1265
01:11:05,348 --> 01:11:07,306
-Give me a hug.
-Bye, Mama. Love you.

1266
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:08,394
Love you.

1267
01:11:08,438 --> 01:11:10,004
-Love you.
-Bye, now. Eat today.

1268
01:11:10,048 --> 01:11:13,443
Most days I try to write.
Recently, not so much.

1269
01:11:20,058 --> 01:11:21,929
As good as my life is...

1270
01:11:22,626 --> 01:11:24,323
I can't help think
of all the plans I had

1271
01:11:24,367 --> 01:11:25,716
that never happened.

1272
01:11:27,892 --> 01:11:30,895
I know that sounds spoiled
to someone in your situation.

1273
01:11:31,374 --> 01:11:33,854
But you said
you want the truth.

1274
01:11:34,986 --> 01:11:37,684
[Todd] Dear Elizabeth,
I cannot thank you enough

1275
01:11:37,728 --> 01:11:40,296
for sharing your thoughts
and feelings with me.

1276
01:11:40,818 --> 01:11:42,602
I never really looked deeply
into myself

1277
01:11:42,646 --> 01:11:43,995
before we started writing...

1278
01:11:44,038 --> 01:11:45,301
[Elizabeth] Dear Todd,
I got your drawing.

1279
01:11:46,127 --> 01:11:47,651
That is so beautiful.

1280
01:11:47,694 --> 01:11:49,217
[Todd] You say you wanna know
what my life is like.

1281
01:11:49,261 --> 01:11:53,134
Well, try staying in your
kitchen for an entire day.

1282
01:11:53,831 --> 01:11:55,833
Then think about
what it'd be like

1283
01:11:55,876 --> 01:11:57,574
to be there
for the rest of your life.

1284
01:11:59,924 --> 01:12:01,969
Regular prisoners talk
about doing time,

1285
01:12:02,013 --> 01:12:04,320
but on the row,
there is no time.

1286
01:12:06,017 --> 01:12:08,672
The clock stopped moving
the minute we were sentenced.

1287
01:12:23,991 --> 01:12:25,602
People say
we should all live life

1288
01:12:25,645 --> 01:12:27,908
like it could be taken away
at any moment.

1289
01:12:29,693 --> 01:12:32,086
Death catches most people
unawares.

1290
01:12:32,435 --> 01:12:34,393
You're asleep, or your body
shuts down,

1291
01:12:34,437 --> 01:12:35,873
or an accident happens,

1292
01:12:35,916 --> 01:12:38,789
but to live every moment,
waiting,

1293
01:12:38,832 --> 01:12:41,922
knowing that they could decide
to kill you at any moment...

1294
01:12:43,446 --> 01:12:45,317
can't help picturing
the dents on the door

1295
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,841
where others have kicked
and fought as they went in.

1296
01:12:59,853 --> 01:13:01,377
[man]
Are you sure you want this one?

1297
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:03,988
It's kind of a snooze, and jury
was only out for an hour.

1298
01:13:04,031 --> 01:13:05,076
I got some better ones.

1299
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:06,599
-Just this one, please.
-All right.

1300
01:13:06,643 --> 01:13:09,080
-Thanks, sir.
-You're welcome. Next.

1301
01:13:09,907 --> 01:13:10,821
[woman] Hey.

1302
01:13:15,956 --> 01:13:17,393
He wanted to get in so bad,

1303
01:13:17,436 --> 01:13:19,786
he broke the windows
with a tire iron,

1304
01:13:20,091 --> 01:13:22,572
but the fire just blew that
glass back at him.

1305
01:13:24,487 --> 01:13:26,184
I've never seen a man
cry so hard.

1306
01:13:30,493 --> 01:13:33,104
He didn't try to save those
kids until the cops showed up.

1307
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:36,455
And it was like
he was putting on a show.

1308
01:13:38,892 --> 01:13:41,199
Don't surprise me,
he started that fire.

1309
01:13:42,853 --> 01:13:44,898
[Mr. Jackson]
This so-called art

1310
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:47,727
hung above
Todd Willingham's bed.

1311
01:13:47,988 --> 01:13:50,382
Dr. Grigson,
what can you tell us about it?

1312
01:13:51,339 --> 01:13:54,691
In my experience, such images
of death and violence

1313
01:13:54,734 --> 01:13:57,781
are often associated
with cultive type activities.

1314
01:13:58,129 --> 01:14:00,740
It is my conclusion
that Todd Willingham

1315
01:14:00,784 --> 01:14:04,265
is a severe sociopath
with violent tendencies.

1316
01:14:05,049 --> 01:14:07,225
[Mr. Jackson] Is it true
that the police were called

1317
01:14:07,268 --> 01:14:09,575
to your home
to control a situation

1318
01:14:09,619 --> 01:14:12,317
where Todd Willingham was
intoxicated,

1319
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:16,234
and calling you a
"whore, bitch, and slut"?

1320
01:14:16,539 --> 01:14:19,150
Todd would do never do anything
to hurt those babies.

1321
01:14:19,193 --> 01:14:21,108
He loved those babies
with all his heart.

1322
01:14:21,152 --> 01:14:23,067
He treated those babies
better than anybody else did.

1323
01:14:23,415 --> 01:14:24,416
Mr. Horton?

1324
01:14:24,721 --> 01:14:26,200
No questions, Your Honor.

1325
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:38,996
Thank you for seeing me,
Mr. Horton.

1326
01:14:39,039 --> 01:14:40,780
Well, you can thank my girl,
Ronda.

1327
01:14:40,824 --> 01:14:42,565
-Yeah?
-She told me I had to see you,

1328
01:14:42,608 --> 01:14:44,131
so you would stop pestering her.

1329
01:14:44,175 --> 01:14:46,525
Oh, well, I just wanted to get
your thoughts

1330
01:14:46,569 --> 01:14:47,961
on Todd Willingham.

1331
01:14:48,005 --> 01:14:49,572
So, you knew him before?

1332
01:14:50,181 --> 01:14:51,182
Oh, yeah.

1333
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,315
I guess everybody in town
knew him, huh?

1334
01:14:54,707 --> 01:14:56,579
Cross the street to stay out
of the way is more like it.

1335
01:14:57,014 --> 01:14:58,537
Nothing but trouble, that boy.

1336
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:00,539
Tell you a little story.

1337
01:15:01,845 --> 01:15:03,890
Night after
Todd's children died,

1338
01:15:04,848 --> 01:15:07,024
the whole town had a gathering
to raise money

1339
01:15:07,415 --> 01:15:08,329
for their funeral.

1340
01:15:09,592 --> 01:15:11,071
He acted like
he'd just won the lottery.

1341
01:15:11,115 --> 01:15:13,378
-[cheering]
-Drinking, playing darts.

1342
01:15:13,421 --> 01:15:15,075
Playing and whooping it up.

1343
01:15:15,119 --> 01:15:17,556
And just because someone acts
inappropriately

1344
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,124
doesn't mean they're a murderer,
though, right?

1345
01:15:21,604 --> 01:15:22,605
You're right.

1346
01:15:24,258 --> 01:15:27,044
What's inappropriate
is taking his part.

1347
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:29,916
Now, you seem like an educated
woman.

1348
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:34,312
He had the motive, he had the
means, the science backed it up.

1349
01:15:34,878 --> 01:15:37,184
What makes you so cock-sure
he's innocent?

1350
01:15:38,621 --> 01:15:40,971
Honestly, I don't know
if he's innocent or not.

1351
01:15:41,406 --> 01:15:43,626
The question is,
did he get a fair trial?

1352
01:15:43,669 --> 01:15:44,931
Let me guess.

1353
01:15:44,975 --> 01:15:46,367
You've seen Todd
and he charmed you.

1354
01:15:47,194 --> 01:15:49,588
He was quite the ladies' man
back in Corsicana.

1355
01:15:49,632 --> 01:15:51,111
I wouldn't know anything
about that.

1356
01:15:51,938 --> 01:15:54,288
But what I do know,
is that you failed

1357
01:15:54,332 --> 01:15:56,769
to challenge witnesses
that changed their story.

1358
01:15:56,813 --> 01:15:58,815
You failed to reach out
to Todd's friends.

1359
01:15:58,858 --> 01:16:01,774
You failed to find
a single scientific expert.

1360
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:05,430
I am sorry, sir, but...
it seems like you barely tried

1361
01:16:05,473 --> 01:16:07,432
to create reasonable doubt
in the jury's minds.

1362
01:16:07,475 --> 01:16:08,781
Where did you get your law
degree, missy?

1363
01:16:09,216 --> 01:16:10,609
State didn't give me
enough money

1364
01:16:10,653 --> 01:16:12,263
to feed these horses
to defend that boy.

1365
01:16:12,306 --> 01:16:13,873
-But I did the best I could.
-Yeah?

1366
01:16:13,917 --> 01:16:16,006
Yeah. And regardless
of your estimation

1367
01:16:16,049 --> 01:16:17,660
of my professional abilities,

1368
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:19,792
the fact remains,

1369
01:16:20,837 --> 01:16:23,796
that boy is a monster,
and he will die.

1370
01:16:27,539 --> 01:16:29,019
Worry about the living,
Ms. Gilbert.

1371
01:16:29,367 --> 01:16:31,325
Yeah, well, maybe,
you should do the same.

1372
01:16:33,937 --> 01:16:35,112
We clearly have enough

1373
01:16:35,155 --> 01:16:36,592
to file an appeal
with the Fifth Circuit.

1374
01:16:36,635 --> 01:16:37,897
Now, I'm sorry, sir,

1375
01:16:37,941 --> 01:16:40,160
but this Horton seems like
a complete loser.

1376
01:16:40,204 --> 01:16:43,424
I mean, he decided
Todd was guilty from the get-go.

1377
01:16:43,468 --> 01:16:45,296
Yeah, granted Todd's trial
was a horror show,

1378
01:16:45,339 --> 01:16:47,037
but it doesn't mean
he's innocent.

1379
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:48,995
But, then,
what about his appeal?

1380
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:52,216
Ms. Gilbert,
I appreciate your zeal.

1381
01:16:52,477 --> 01:16:54,653
I worked this case for six
years, and got nowhere.

1382
01:16:54,697 --> 01:16:57,090
There's so many others that
needed my help who I can help.

1383
01:16:57,395 --> 01:17:00,703
-But, then, what if--
-They denied him habeas corpus.

1384
01:17:00,746 --> 01:17:02,792
You're asking the state
to reopen a case

1385
01:17:02,835 --> 01:17:03,967
based on character witnesses,

1386
01:17:04,315 --> 01:17:06,360
when the primary factor
in this conviction

1387
01:17:06,404 --> 01:17:07,971
was the arson investigation.

1388
01:17:08,885 --> 01:17:12,192
Now, I have to agree with
the experts here, Ms. Gilbert.

1389
01:17:12,845 --> 01:17:13,933
Fire does not lie.

1390
01:17:15,326 --> 01:17:18,590
Look, you've been kind to him,
and I admire that.

1391
01:17:19,112 --> 01:17:21,506
A personal involvement
can blind you to the truth.

1392
01:17:21,767 --> 01:17:22,899
I've been there.

1393
01:17:24,335 --> 01:17:25,771
Just don't let your emotions
get the better of you.

1394
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:29,949
My emotions? What?
'Cause I'm a woman?

1395
01:17:30,428 --> 01:17:32,865
[sighs] That's not what I meant.

1396
01:17:32,909 --> 01:17:34,519
Well, then,
why don't you enlighten me?

1397
01:17:36,521 --> 01:17:38,305
Have sympathy for the man
he's become,

1398
01:17:38,741 --> 01:17:40,743
don't forget about
the man he was.

1399
01:17:40,786 --> 01:17:42,919
Great. I'mma go
finish your job for you.

1400
01:17:43,354 --> 01:17:44,485
Hold on a sec.

1401
01:17:47,227 --> 01:17:48,968
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be rude,

1402
01:17:49,012 --> 01:17:51,101
but it's just, it's been a long
road for me on this one,

1403
01:17:51,144 --> 01:17:52,406
and I got to let it
go at some point.

1404
01:17:52,450 --> 01:17:53,494
But you know what?

1405
01:17:53,538 --> 01:17:54,974
I've been reading this one file.

1406
01:17:55,018 --> 01:17:57,281
This Johnny Webb character,
and his testimony

1407
01:17:57,324 --> 01:17:58,978
seems like a complete lie.

1408
01:17:59,022 --> 01:18:00,850
I mean, is there a way we can
get to him?

1409
01:18:07,726 --> 01:18:10,990
[machine buzzing]

1410
01:18:14,951 --> 01:18:15,952
Hey!

1411
01:18:17,562 --> 01:18:18,563
Hey!

1412
01:18:20,652 --> 01:18:23,089
[machine whirring, stops]

1413
01:18:23,568 --> 01:18:25,048
Hey, how's it going?

1414
01:18:25,396 --> 01:18:27,137
Are you from one of those
church groups?

1415
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:30,009
No, uh, Judge Powell called you,
right?

1416
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:32,011
Yeah.

1417
01:18:32,403 --> 01:18:33,709
Yeah, I've been...

1418
01:18:34,405 --> 01:18:37,495
talking to some people
about Todd Willingham.

1419
01:18:39,062 --> 01:18:40,063
Sounds familiar.

1420
01:18:40,411 --> 01:18:43,022
Yeah, you, talked to the court

1421
01:18:43,501 --> 01:18:45,808
about how he confessed to you...

1422
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:49,115
about starting a fire
that killed his daughters.

1423
01:18:51,814 --> 01:18:54,817
Right. Yeah, now I remember.

1424
01:18:55,078 --> 01:18:57,602
It was sad. Real sad.

1425
01:18:58,342 --> 01:19:01,649
Yeah, I've been reading
your testimony, carefully.

1426
01:19:02,259 --> 01:19:04,174
Just wondering how all that
happened.

1427
01:19:04,696 --> 01:19:06,263
It's a long time ago, you know.

1428
01:19:07,133 --> 01:19:09,222
Yeah, I can't remember
last week.

1429
01:19:11,050 --> 01:19:12,138
But it sure would help

1430
01:19:13,009 --> 01:19:15,098
if there's anything
you could tell me.

1431
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:18,579
Well... Uh...

1432
01:19:19,667 --> 01:19:21,191
I was just sitting in my cell.

1433
01:19:21,887 --> 01:19:25,543
You know? And... And this guy
gets put in with me.

1434
01:19:27,284 --> 01:19:29,852
He's talking for a while and...

1435
01:19:30,722 --> 01:19:32,419
he confessed to me right there.

1436
01:19:33,159 --> 01:19:35,118
-That's about it.
-Just like that?

1437
01:19:38,686 --> 01:19:41,864
You felt like you knew
Todd well, or...

1438
01:19:42,168 --> 01:19:44,692
Like I said,
we shared a cell, so, you know.

1439
01:19:47,913 --> 01:19:49,654
Why do you think
he confessed to you?

1440
01:19:52,613 --> 01:19:54,833
I guess he just needed to tell
somebody.

1441
01:19:55,312 --> 01:19:57,836
You know? Sometimes
a stranger's good for that.

1442
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:59,229
How's that work?

1443
01:20:00,883 --> 01:20:03,755
When you testify
in somebody else's case,

1444
01:20:04,451 --> 01:20:08,151
they, um... give you
a reduced sentence or...

1445
01:20:09,108 --> 01:20:10,327
did things change?

1446
01:20:11,894 --> 01:20:13,243
You're a welder, huh?

1447
01:20:14,157 --> 01:20:16,333
-Guess so.
-My dad, too.

1448
01:20:17,247 --> 01:20:18,422
Is that what you wanted to do?

1449
01:20:21,077 --> 01:20:22,818
Underwater welder, actually.

1450
01:20:22,861 --> 01:20:24,645
-The coolest job.
-[laughs]

1451
01:20:25,777 --> 01:20:27,953
-Is that what you are now?
-I wish.

1452
01:20:28,998 --> 01:20:31,261
I took a course, though,
been studying and shit,

1453
01:20:31,304 --> 01:20:32,871
you know, I took it down in--

1454
01:20:32,915 --> 01:20:34,046
Don't tell me, Houston?

1455
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:37,920
-Houston. Yeah.
-At The Ocean Corporation?

1456
01:20:37,963 --> 01:20:40,313
Yeah, damn right.
They got everything in there.

1457
01:20:40,357 --> 01:20:42,446
-It's expensive.
-Yeah, you ain't kidding.

1458
01:20:42,707 --> 01:20:45,362
-That's far from here, too.
-Yeah, you know.

1459
01:20:45,666 --> 01:20:47,407
-Drove my truck, though.
-This one?

1460
01:20:47,451 --> 01:20:50,236
-Yeah, yeah, that's my baby.
-Now, that is-- That's sweet.

1461
01:20:50,628 --> 01:20:52,064
Almost got it new, too.

1462
01:20:52,456 --> 01:20:54,371
Why are you asking me about all
this?

1463
01:20:54,414 --> 01:20:55,807
How did you pay for this?

1464
01:20:57,940 --> 01:20:59,811
Oh! I know what I wanted to
ask you.

1465
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:02,814
Did Jackson,
the district attorney...

1466
01:21:03,946 --> 01:21:06,165
did he promise you
a reduced sentence

1467
01:21:06,209 --> 01:21:07,427
for that little story
you told?

1468
01:21:07,471 --> 01:21:09,821
-I don't know. I--
-Did he do that to you?

1469
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:10,996
-I don't know.
-Like promise

1470
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,302
to take care of you?

1471
01:21:12,345 --> 01:21:13,303
They do that?

1472
01:21:14,565 --> 01:21:15,827
You know, I don't wanna
talk no more, so...

1473
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:17,916
I'm sorry, Johnny, but...
was that the deal?

1474
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:19,918
Yeah, but I ain't supposed
to talk about this stuff, so--

1475
01:21:19,962 --> 01:21:21,920
Who told you not to talk about
it, the district attorney

1476
01:21:21,964 --> 01:21:24,401
is asking you not to talk,
and they're using you--

1477
01:21:24,444 --> 01:21:25,881
It's time for you to leave,
lady--

1478
01:21:25,924 --> 01:21:27,926
Listen to me, they are gonna
kill an innocent person.

1479
01:21:27,970 --> 01:21:29,580
And then you have to
live with it?

1480
01:21:29,623 --> 01:21:30,886
-I'm done here!
-They're gonna kill

1481
01:21:30,929 --> 01:21:32,539
an innocent man
and you have to live with it?

1482
01:21:32,583 --> 01:21:34,150
You know, I got a gun.

1483
01:21:38,284 --> 01:21:41,722
-All right. We're just talking.
-I'm done talking.

1484
01:21:41,766 --> 01:21:43,681
Okay. All right, I'm not a cop.

1485
01:21:46,597 --> 01:21:48,381
-Get the fuck outta here then!
-Okay.

1486
01:21:54,257 --> 01:21:55,388
You could help.

1487
01:21:56,737 --> 01:21:57,825
Please.

1488
01:22:03,309 --> 01:22:04,528
[Todd] He threatened you?

1489
01:22:04,745 --> 01:22:06,660
That stupid motherfucker,
he threatened you?

1490
01:22:06,704 --> 01:22:09,925
Mm-hmm. Listen to me,
his story stinks. You know why?

1491
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:12,231
That guy's a snitch.

1492
01:22:13,232 --> 01:22:15,974
I think the DA paid somebody
to pay him off.

1493
01:22:16,018 --> 01:22:17,715
-He took a bribe?
-Mm-hmm.

1494
01:22:18,107 --> 01:22:19,760
Oh, he's a spineless
piece of shit.

1495
01:22:19,804 --> 01:22:21,849
But do you understand
what that means?

1496
01:22:22,241 --> 01:22:25,853
We got a snitch,
a gas can that was never found

1497
01:22:26,115 --> 01:22:28,247
-and Stacy's testimony.
-Yeah.

1498
01:22:28,291 --> 01:22:29,509
Look at all this evidence.

1499
01:22:30,989 --> 01:22:32,948
Reeve says there's no problem.
We've got plenty to go.

1500
01:22:32,991 --> 01:22:34,688
File an appeal
with the Fifth Circuit.

1501
01:22:34,732 --> 01:22:37,865
Fifth Circuit. I already spent
five of my appeals, Liz.

1502
01:22:38,475 --> 01:22:40,956
-I only got one more left.
-But you got one more left.

1503
01:22:40,999 --> 01:22:42,914
It's gonna go the same way
as all the others.

1504
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:45,525
Todd, you've got one more.

1505
01:22:53,925 --> 01:22:55,535
Do you think life is fair, Liz?

1506
01:22:58,060 --> 01:22:59,104
Hell no.

1507
01:23:01,628 --> 01:23:03,326
Do you think God
is all right with that?

1508
01:23:03,587 --> 01:23:05,502
I don't think we know what His
plan is.

1509
01:23:05,545 --> 01:23:07,939
I don't even try
to begin to imagine.

1510
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:14,990
I wanna live.

1511
01:23:16,382 --> 01:23:18,471
That's why we're not gonna give
up for one second.

1512
01:23:19,646 --> 01:23:20,865
Okay?

1513
01:23:23,302 --> 01:23:24,738
So, life isn't fair.

1514
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:28,916
What are we gonna do with that?

1515
01:23:34,705 --> 01:23:38,187
I mean, maybe this, right now...

1516
01:23:40,493 --> 01:23:42,147
is the best we get.

1517
01:23:43,975 --> 01:23:45,716
Us being here for each other.

1518
01:23:47,848 --> 01:23:49,720
Knowing how wrong it all this.

1519
01:23:53,332 --> 01:23:54,812
Maybe this is the God part.

1520
01:23:58,816 --> 01:24:02,907
All of us down here
trying to figure it all out.

1521
01:24:21,969 --> 01:24:23,580
That's beautiful, baby.

1522
01:24:26,583 --> 01:24:27,888
Is this our house?

1523
01:24:31,631 --> 01:24:34,025
Is that Mommy? Is she crying?

1524
01:24:36,114 --> 01:24:37,898
She crying because I was
mean to her?

1525
01:24:42,947 --> 01:24:44,079
Is this Daddy?

1526
01:24:46,733 --> 01:24:48,213
Daddy was bad, huh?

1527
01:24:54,045 --> 01:24:55,438
I'm sorry, baby.

1528
01:24:59,877 --> 01:25:03,620
The doctor who testified that
Todd was a sociopath

1529
01:25:03,663 --> 01:25:05,317
never even met him.

1530
01:25:06,057 --> 01:25:07,406
[Andrew] That seems unfair.

1531
01:25:07,711 --> 01:25:08,886
Exactly.

1532
01:25:10,366 --> 01:25:11,454
Yeah.

1533
01:25:11,497 --> 01:25:14,021
They bring him in
whenever they want

1534
01:25:14,065 --> 01:25:15,719
a guaranteed death penalty.

1535
01:25:16,633 --> 01:25:19,114
His nickname is Dr. Death.

1536
01:25:19,462 --> 01:25:20,985
-Dr. Death?
-He...

1537
01:25:21,333 --> 01:25:22,508
He was expelled

1538
01:25:22,552 --> 01:25:24,771
from the American
Psychiatric Association

1539
01:25:24,815 --> 01:25:28,906
"for making diagnosis
without meeting defendants."

1540
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:31,387
This is why you read everything.

1541
01:25:33,650 --> 01:25:35,913
I swear I'm gonna cook for you
tomorrow night.

1542
01:25:35,956 --> 01:25:38,002
-That is just pitiful.
-I like cold pizza.

1543
01:25:38,394 --> 01:25:40,570
I do, too, but at least
put it on a plate.

1544
01:25:42,049 --> 01:25:45,749
Hey, you. Juls, did a Dr. Hurst
call when I was out?

1545
01:25:45,792 --> 01:25:47,142
Nope. Bye.

1546
01:25:47,185 --> 01:25:48,882
-Where you headed?
-Studying.

1547
01:25:48,926 --> 01:25:50,145
[Elizabeth] With Dave?

1548
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:54,627
You mean you actually know
his name?

1549
01:25:57,195 --> 01:25:58,153
What?

1550
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:02,157
Look...

1551
01:26:03,984 --> 01:26:04,985
What?

1552
01:26:05,856 --> 01:26:07,510
I know how amazing it must be

1553
01:26:07,553 --> 01:26:09,555
being pen pals
with a murderer...

1554
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:12,254
but it's like you think

1555
01:26:12,297 --> 01:26:13,603
you're some kind of hero
or something.

1556
01:26:14,778 --> 01:26:16,214
Do you even know that Andrew

1557
01:26:16,258 --> 01:26:17,694
is crying himself to sleep
at night

1558
01:26:17,737 --> 01:26:19,043
because he misses Daddy?

1559
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:23,569
You have no idea
what's going on around here.

1560
01:26:26,703 --> 01:26:27,878
I do.

1561
01:26:28,270 --> 01:26:29,271
You don't.

1562
01:26:29,923 --> 01:26:31,316
That's just not true.

1563
01:26:36,495 --> 01:26:37,844
I'm sorry.

1564
01:26:41,935 --> 01:26:43,633
I'm sorry, sweet pea.

1565
01:26:46,375 --> 01:26:47,941
[man on radio]
Dallas is now inside the field

1566
01:26:47,985 --> 01:26:49,987
goal range on the Arizona 37,

1567
01:26:50,030 --> 01:26:51,249
second down and eight.

1568
01:26:51,293 --> 01:26:52,859
Cowboys come
out of the shotgun.

1569
01:26:52,903 --> 01:26:54,121
There's a snap.

1570
01:26:54,165 --> 01:26:55,253
Cardinals coming
with the blitz,

1571
01:26:55,297 --> 01:26:56,776
Huntington scrambling left.

1572
01:26:56,820 --> 01:26:58,996
-It's picked off again.
-Come on.

1573
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:00,606
This time by Adrian Wilson.

1574
01:27:01,128 --> 01:27:03,087
What kind of lame-ass excuse
for a quarterback

1575
01:27:03,130 --> 01:27:05,089
throws three interceptions
in the first quarter?

1576
01:27:05,132 --> 01:27:07,657
[laughs] Hey, Willingham?
Cowboys suck.

1577
01:27:07,700 --> 01:27:09,659
-Hey, shut the fuck up.
-Whoever thought the Cowboys

1578
01:27:09,702 --> 01:27:10,790
wouldn't make the playoffs

1579
01:27:10,834 --> 01:27:12,227
-three years in a goddamn row.
-Yeah.

1580
01:27:12,879 --> 01:27:14,185
It sucks.

1581
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:15,099
Unbelievable.

1582
01:27:16,535 --> 01:27:17,275
[Elizabeth] Well, first of all,
we are talking

1583
01:27:17,319 --> 01:27:18,450
about a man's life.

1584
01:27:18,494 --> 01:27:19,538
So, now, you're spearheading
an effort

1585
01:27:19,582 --> 01:27:21,105
to prove Todd's innocence?

1586
01:27:21,148 --> 01:27:23,063
Well, I wouldn't say
spearheading,

1587
01:27:23,107 --> 01:27:24,630
but I am helping
his lawyer.

1588
01:27:25,152 --> 01:27:27,329
Todd's trial was
a complete travesty.

1589
01:27:27,372 --> 01:27:28,808
[man on radio]
What a great ball game...

1590
01:27:28,852 --> 01:27:31,855
Hey, Willingham. They're talking
about you on the radio.

1591
01:27:31,898 --> 01:27:34,249
Hey, Todd,
change the station, man.

1592
01:27:35,815 --> 01:27:37,469
Which frequency are we on?

1593
01:27:37,513 --> 01:27:38,514
It's 1060.

1594
01:27:40,472 --> 01:27:41,908
[Elizabeth]
...knew that I was going to

1595
01:27:42,213 --> 01:27:44,911
supposedly meet
a killer, but...

1596
01:27:45,999 --> 01:27:49,960
I found myself talking
to a vulnerable, sensitive man.

1597
01:27:50,395 --> 01:27:52,179
He was very easy to talk to.

1598
01:27:52,223 --> 01:27:53,877
How do you expect to change
people's minds

1599
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:56,053
who know of Todd's past,

1600
01:27:56,096 --> 01:27:59,883
that he beat his wife in front
of multiple witnesses but--

1601
01:27:59,926 --> 01:28:01,798
[Elizabeth] I mean, have you
ever been cruel to someone

1602
01:28:01,841 --> 01:28:03,843
in your life?
That make you a murderer?

1603
01:28:04,148 --> 01:28:05,018
No.

1604
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:09,719
Uh, it was very clear
that witness testimony

1605
01:28:09,762 --> 01:28:11,895
changed from the time
they talked to the police,

1606
01:28:11,938 --> 01:28:13,766
to the time they were
in a courtroom.

1607
01:28:13,810 --> 01:28:15,768
There's new DNA
evidence in this case.

1608
01:28:15,812 --> 01:28:17,727
There may be new fire evidence.

1609
01:28:17,770 --> 01:28:20,425
There are more questions
to answer here.

1610
01:28:20,469 --> 01:28:22,122
[radio presenter] So,
what you're telling me is

1611
01:28:22,166 --> 01:28:24,821
you believe that
Todd is innocent?

1612
01:28:27,563 --> 01:28:28,651
Yes, I am.

1613
01:28:29,782 --> 01:28:31,001
I believe the State of Texas

1614
01:28:31,044 --> 01:28:32,916
is about to kill
an innocent man.

1615
01:28:34,526 --> 01:28:36,398
Would you wanna
kill an innocent man?

1616
01:28:37,355 --> 01:28:39,923
There is more than enough
evidence

1617
01:28:39,966 --> 01:28:42,099
for Todd to be
granted an appeal.

1618
01:28:42,142 --> 01:28:43,796
If there's any question...

1619
01:28:45,058 --> 01:28:47,365
-Hey.
-...evidence or any...

1620
01:28:47,409 --> 01:28:48,714
Your date's been set.

1621
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:51,413
February 17th.

1622
01:29:18,483 --> 01:29:19,702
Now I feel excited.

1623
01:29:21,268 --> 01:29:23,314
I read something on somebody
who's supposed to be, like,

1624
01:29:23,358 --> 01:29:26,404
the world expert on fires.
His name's Hurst.

1625
01:29:26,970 --> 01:29:28,145
I've got a message to him

1626
01:29:28,188 --> 01:29:30,103
and found out
he lives in Austin.

1627
01:29:30,582 --> 01:29:32,584
And I just feel like
that's what we need.

1628
01:29:32,628 --> 01:29:35,152
You know, we need an expert
who can come in

1629
01:29:35,195 --> 01:29:37,807
and challenge this absurdity.

1630
01:29:37,850 --> 01:29:39,548
Liz, I'm not here to be saved.

1631
01:29:40,810 --> 01:29:42,551
-Well, I'm not--
-I'm not a character

1632
01:29:42,594 --> 01:29:45,510
in one of your fucking plays
or a pretend boyfriend,

1633
01:29:45,554 --> 01:29:48,861
or someone here to percolate
some excitement

1634
01:29:48,905 --> 01:29:52,082
in your otherwise boring,
ex-fucking housewife life.

1635
01:29:54,214 --> 01:29:55,781
I am here to die.

1636
01:30:01,874 --> 01:30:05,356
These are my last days, Liz,
not yours.

1637
01:30:07,010 --> 01:30:09,621
And I don't need them filled up
with your false hope.

1638
01:30:11,667 --> 01:30:15,410
Now, I am grateful for all
the faith you've had in me.

1639
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:18,891
All the work, everything,

1640
01:30:18,935 --> 01:30:21,416
but it don't matter
what truth you find now.

1641
01:30:21,459 --> 01:30:23,069
It ain't gonna make
no difference.

1642
01:30:30,729 --> 01:30:31,730
I lied, Liz.

1643
01:30:34,341 --> 01:30:35,473
I lied to you.

1644
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:41,392
I lied to everybody.

1645
01:30:47,529 --> 01:30:50,227
I said I went in straight
to the girls' room, which I did.

1646
01:30:51,054 --> 01:30:53,926
Crawled over to them,
burning shit falling on me

1647
01:30:53,970 --> 01:30:56,363
and smoke everywhere,
everything was on fire.

1648
01:30:56,799 --> 01:30:58,627
[Todd coughing]

1649
01:30:59,541 --> 01:31:01,281
I tried to get in,
but I couldn't

1650
01:31:01,325 --> 01:31:02,500
'cause it was too hot.

1651
01:31:04,328 --> 01:31:05,416
[Todd] Amber!

1652
01:31:11,944 --> 01:31:13,468
I already knew that they...

1653
01:31:16,122 --> 01:31:17,863
[Todd coughing]

1654
01:31:31,616 --> 01:31:33,226
[sirens wailing]

1655
01:31:54,552 --> 01:31:56,685
[sobbing] I was too afraid to...

1656
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:03,343
I was too afraid to see my own
kids burning to death.

1657
01:32:12,396 --> 01:32:14,441
I wanted to go back in,
but I couldn't

1658
01:32:14,485 --> 01:32:15,704
'cause I was too afraid.

1659
01:32:20,796 --> 01:32:22,275
So I am guilty.

1660
01:32:29,979 --> 01:32:32,982
Any man who can't save his own
kids don't deserve to live.

1661
01:32:51,348 --> 01:32:52,828
He wants to stop.

1662
01:32:55,744 --> 01:32:59,138
Maybe he's right.
Maybe we're just torturing him.

1663
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:03,578
I mean, what chance have we got
honestly?

1664
01:33:06,668 --> 01:33:09,671
Doesn't matter. How many
think...

1665
01:33:10,846 --> 01:33:12,587
You think this is just about
Todd?

1666
01:33:14,023 --> 01:33:16,373
System doesn't work,
it's broken.

1667
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:20,377
How many others out there
you think been fucked over?

1668
01:33:26,252 --> 01:33:27,297
[Stacy] Yeah.

1669
01:33:28,515 --> 01:33:30,909
For a while there,
we was crazy in love.

1670
01:33:32,824 --> 01:33:35,871
And then we got married
after the twins was born and...

1671
01:33:37,524 --> 01:33:40,745
I thought that meant
he really loved me, but...

1672
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:44,923
now I think he was just doing it
for them.

1673
01:33:45,228 --> 01:33:48,013
Well, Stacy, if there's anything
you can remember

1674
01:33:48,057 --> 01:33:49,667
that we could use to save him...

1675
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:52,235
this is it.

1676
01:33:53,323 --> 01:33:54,672
They're about to kill him.

1677
01:33:58,110 --> 01:33:59,329
I know that, yeah.

1678
01:33:59,634 --> 01:34:01,070
Please help us.

1679
01:34:06,379 --> 01:34:09,252
My brother, he's police.

1680
01:34:12,342 --> 01:34:15,911
He says, Todd gets off,
they're gonna come after me

1681
01:34:15,954 --> 01:34:18,000
and persecute me and Todd's
gonna help them do it.

1682
01:34:18,043 --> 01:34:19,915
I don't wanna go to jail
instead of him.

1683
01:34:21,699 --> 01:34:23,005
That's crazy.

1684
01:34:25,355 --> 01:34:26,878
Todd loves you.

1685
01:34:27,749 --> 01:34:31,230
He talks about you all the time.
You need to go see him.

1686
01:34:34,016 --> 01:34:35,670
Mm-mm. I can't do that.

1687
01:34:35,931 --> 01:34:40,152
Stacy, he was the father
of your babies.

1688
01:34:41,110 --> 01:34:46,028
And he's changed.
Please, just go see him.

1689
01:34:56,516 --> 01:34:57,909
-Hey, honey.
-Oh, hey, Mom.

1690
01:34:58,214 --> 01:34:59,955
Hey, a doctor left you
a message.

1691
01:34:59,998 --> 01:35:01,608
-Doctor Hu--
-Hurst?

1692
01:35:01,652 --> 01:35:02,784
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God.

1693
01:35:02,827 --> 01:35:04,133
Wait. Mom, is everything okay?

1694
01:35:05,134 --> 01:35:06,831
Yeah, buddy,
not that kind of doctor.

1695
01:35:06,875 --> 01:35:08,224
-All right.
-Have a great day.

1696
01:35:08,267 --> 01:35:09,660
-All right.
-Okay.

1697
01:35:15,927 --> 01:35:16,972
[sighs]

1698
01:35:18,974 --> 01:35:20,062
[Dr. Hurst humming]

1699
01:35:23,848 --> 01:35:26,851
We're so grateful
that you're willing to dive in

1700
01:35:26,895 --> 01:35:28,287
like this. I mean--

1701
01:35:28,331 --> 01:35:30,725
What's your sign?

1702
01:35:32,204 --> 01:35:34,641
-Excuse me?
-Under what sign

1703
01:35:34,685 --> 01:35:36,905
of the zodiac were you born?

1704
01:35:38,341 --> 01:35:40,125
-Aries.
-And your horoscope,

1705
01:35:40,169 --> 01:35:41,213
do you read it?

1706
01:35:42,475 --> 01:35:44,434
-Sometimes, I guess.
-Sometimes it's right

1707
01:35:44,477 --> 01:35:47,437
-and sometimes it's wrong.
-Well, all that stuff is just...

1708
01:35:47,829 --> 01:35:51,658
People have always been
fascinated

1709
01:35:52,050 --> 01:35:55,271
by the stars, they chartered
their movements.

1710
01:35:55,314 --> 01:35:59,492
They could tell you
when Mercury was retrograde

1711
01:35:59,536 --> 01:36:02,539
or when Mars was aligned
with Venus.

1712
01:36:03,496 --> 01:36:08,806
They made predictions
based on these observations.

1713
01:36:08,850 --> 01:36:11,896
These people were called
astrologers.

1714
01:36:12,941 --> 01:36:15,770
They were the experts
on the solar system.

1715
01:36:16,335 --> 01:36:18,903
Until the science of astronomy
came along

1716
01:36:18,947 --> 01:36:22,037
and proved their ideas
to be nothing but bullpucky.

1717
01:36:22,341 --> 01:36:27,303
I've studied the report
their experts wrote.

1718
01:36:39,141 --> 01:36:40,142
Follow me.

1719
01:36:42,187 --> 01:36:44,624
-Move your feet.
-Oh!

1720
01:37:06,168 --> 01:37:07,256
What do you see?

1721
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:09,171
Oh...

1722
01:37:10,346 --> 01:37:12,827
-nothing?
-Exactly. No burn signature.

1723
01:37:13,915 --> 01:37:18,267
And no such thing
as crazed glass either.

1724
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:26,144
The spider pattern happens...

1725
01:37:27,711 --> 01:37:30,453
when it's hit by cold water
from the fire hoses.

1726
01:37:31,454 --> 01:37:33,325
-[glass crackles]
-Ah!

1727
01:37:35,066 --> 01:37:39,984
I spent two days going over
every detail of this case.

1728
01:37:40,419 --> 01:37:42,769
Thing about investigators
is they tend to find

1729
01:37:42,813 --> 01:37:46,121
what they're looking for,
even if it isn't there.

1730
01:37:47,252 --> 01:37:49,776
They'd already decided
Todd was guilty

1731
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:51,822
before they walked
into that house.

1732
01:37:52,997 --> 01:37:55,217
They were so sure it was arson,

1733
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:57,784
they didn't even bother to
check the space heater.

1734
01:37:59,612 --> 01:38:01,919
Whoever installed
the electrical wiring

1735
01:38:01,963 --> 01:38:04,313
had never even heard
of a Safety Code.

1736
01:38:06,619 --> 01:38:08,012
-[Todd] Girls?
-[Dr. Hurst] Those flames

1737
01:38:08,056 --> 01:38:09,579
ran up the ceiling

1738
01:38:09,622 --> 01:38:12,538
burning the walls,
before moving their way down.

1739
01:38:12,582 --> 01:38:13,626
[Amber] Daddy!

1740
01:38:15,193 --> 01:38:16,194
[Dr. Hurst] The fire was
what we call a flashover.

1741
01:38:17,674 --> 01:38:19,328
Instant combustion
of everything flammable.

1742
01:38:19,371 --> 01:38:22,070
The V pattern the experts
found...

1743
01:38:22,374 --> 01:38:24,550
also a signature of a
flashover.

1744
01:38:28,728 --> 01:38:30,513
The accelerant on the porch.

1745
01:38:31,340 --> 01:38:33,516
[Dr. Hurst] Charcoal grill
and lighter fluid

1746
01:38:33,559 --> 01:38:35,997
the expert somehow neglected
to mention.

1747
01:38:38,434 --> 01:38:40,915
My babies are burning up!

1748
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:43,918
And the refrigerator
that blocked the back door?

1749
01:38:46,007 --> 01:38:48,487
Linoleum underneath is
untouched.

1750
01:38:48,531 --> 01:38:50,402
It was always there,
never been moved.

1751
01:38:50,837 --> 01:38:51,926
[sighs]

1752
01:38:53,405 --> 01:38:55,973
My report is based on hundreds
of hours of experiments

1753
01:38:56,017 --> 01:38:57,975
by the most rigorous scientists
in the field,

1754
01:38:58,019 --> 01:38:59,934
these so-called experts
of theirs

1755
01:38:59,977 --> 01:39:01,370
may have seen lots of fires,

1756
01:39:01,413 --> 01:39:03,938
but in the end,
they're just astrologers.

1757
01:39:06,331 --> 01:39:09,421
-Thank you, Mr. Hurst.
-Thank you so much.

1758
01:39:09,465 --> 01:39:11,293
There's also just one more thing

1759
01:39:11,336 --> 01:39:14,513
-that we have to...
-What we owe you.

1760
01:39:14,557 --> 01:39:16,994
I don't believe in astrology,
Ms. Gilbert,

1761
01:39:18,039 --> 01:39:19,736
but I do believe in karma.

1762
01:39:20,171 --> 01:39:23,044
Mine can use all the help it can
get. The pleasure's mine.

1763
01:39:25,307 --> 01:39:27,526
Todd, we got Hurst.
Listen to me.

1764
01:39:27,918 --> 01:39:30,965
We got to Hurst.
We got to him.

1765
01:39:31,008 --> 01:39:33,097
He said there's no way
that fire was arson.

1766
01:39:33,141 --> 01:39:34,272
You know what that means?

1767
01:39:34,316 --> 01:39:35,926
If there's no arson,
there's no crime.

1768
01:39:36,144 --> 01:39:38,537
-Can you believe it?
-No, I can't.

1769
01:39:38,581 --> 01:39:40,496
-Oh, my God.
-It's just like

1770
01:39:40,539 --> 01:39:41,976
I've been saying the whole time.

1771
01:39:42,019 --> 01:39:44,108
Well, Reeves is on his way
to Parole Board right now.

1772
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:46,110
He said there's no way
they won't regard this

1773
01:39:46,154 --> 01:39:47,242
as exculpatory evidence.

1774
01:39:49,635 --> 01:39:52,421
Todd, we have a real chance.

1775
01:39:55,163 --> 01:39:57,121
Oh, I don't know, Liz.

1776
01:39:59,428 --> 01:40:01,473
I'm not fixing to start
hoping again.

1777
01:40:02,431 --> 01:40:03,519
Hope is bad.

1778
01:40:03,867 --> 01:40:05,608
I got 10 days left.

1779
01:40:05,651 --> 01:40:07,784
If I start hoping again,
them 10 days is gonna go by

1780
01:40:07,827 --> 01:40:11,788
-just like that.
-I understand, but I'm hoping.

1781
01:40:19,535 --> 01:40:21,058
You know what I was ruminating
on just now

1782
01:40:21,102 --> 01:40:22,538
while I was waiting
for you?

1783
01:40:22,581 --> 01:40:26,194
-What?
-After all them terrible things

1784
01:40:26,237 --> 01:40:28,239
I said to you,
I thought you'd given up on me.

1785
01:40:30,894 --> 01:40:31,764
Never.

1786
01:40:47,302 --> 01:40:48,390
Never.

1787
01:40:57,790 --> 01:40:59,923
-Irene?
-Yes?

1788
01:40:59,966 --> 01:41:01,577
I need to get this copy
of Hurst's report

1789
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:03,709
over to the Board
of Pardons and Paroles.

1790
01:41:03,753 --> 01:41:04,754
All right?

1791
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:08,062
Second thought, got this.
Thank you. Sorry.

1792
01:41:11,239 --> 01:41:12,849
-Hi, Cindy.
-Hi, Skip.

1793
01:41:12,892 --> 01:41:15,286
I was wondering
if you can get this out ASAP?

1794
01:41:15,330 --> 01:41:17,158
-Sure thing.
-Thanks so much.

1795
01:41:17,201 --> 01:41:19,029
-You have a good one.
-You too.

1796
01:41:26,993 --> 01:41:28,995
[fax machine whirring]

1797
01:41:36,655 --> 01:41:39,702
[woman] This fax just came in
from the Parole Board, sir.

1798
01:41:45,142 --> 01:41:46,883
How can they deny it without
reading it?

1799
01:41:48,102 --> 01:41:49,712
No need-- No, no, no.

1800
01:41:49,755 --> 01:41:51,888
It's a new interpretation
of existing evidence

1801
01:41:51,931 --> 01:41:54,456
using scientific methods
that weren't available then.

1802
01:41:55,239 --> 01:41:57,415
That constitutes new evidence.

1803
01:41:59,330 --> 01:42:01,289
How could they not even meet?

1804
01:42:01,724 --> 01:42:03,900
It-- Hello? Hello?

1805
01:42:08,122 --> 01:42:10,602
Irene, I want a--
I want a draft in appeal

1806
01:42:10,646 --> 01:42:12,561
for a 30-day stay of execution.

1807
01:42:13,083 --> 01:42:15,564
[Irene] You don't have to shout.
There's an intercom, you know.

1808
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:24,007
And find out how late
the governor's office is open.

1809
01:42:33,234 --> 01:42:34,148
Hi.

1810
01:42:35,279 --> 01:42:36,237
Hi.

1811
01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:39,153
Thanks for coming.

1812
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:42,852
How you been?

1813
01:42:46,072 --> 01:42:47,335
-Good.
-Good.

1814
01:42:49,032 --> 01:42:50,120
You look good.

1815
01:42:51,252 --> 01:42:52,949
-No, I don't.
-Yeah, you do.

1816
01:42:53,602 --> 01:42:54,907
Them eyes, now.

1817
01:43:00,783 --> 01:43:02,785
You been wanting me to come here
all these years,

1818
01:43:02,828 --> 01:43:04,178
what's on your mind?

1819
01:43:06,789 --> 01:43:09,139
Ms. Gilbert says my only chance
now

1820
01:43:09,183 --> 01:43:11,010
is stay of execution
from the Governor.

1821
01:43:12,316 --> 01:43:13,970
I just need a statement
from you.

1822
01:43:15,493 --> 01:43:16,799
I don't think that

1823
01:43:16,842 --> 01:43:18,496
-I can do that, Todd.
-Why not?

1824
01:43:18,540 --> 01:43:19,758
You know I already wrote
a letter

1825
01:43:19,802 --> 01:43:21,020
to Governor Ann Richards

1826
01:43:21,064 --> 01:43:22,326
trying to defend you,
she didn't respond.

1827
01:43:22,370 --> 01:43:23,632
You just gotta go
to Governor Perry.

1828
01:43:23,675 --> 01:43:24,807
Otherwise,
I don't get my pardon.

1829
01:43:24,850 --> 01:43:26,330
I've been the only one
defending you

1830
01:43:26,374 --> 01:43:28,245
-this whole time.
-What's stopping you now then?

1831
01:43:28,289 --> 01:43:30,247
A lot of things.
Grandma. Do you have any idea

1832
01:43:30,291 --> 01:43:31,727
how many people
don't want me to do that?

1833
01:43:31,770 --> 01:43:33,032
Well, there's only you.

1834
01:43:35,948 --> 01:43:37,689
I just don't think that
I can do that.

1835
01:43:37,733 --> 01:43:39,735
-Why'd you come here then?
-We were married,

1836
01:43:39,778 --> 01:43:41,780
-weren't we? I figured I should.
-That ain't the reason.

1837
01:43:42,041 --> 01:43:44,392
I think you feel guilty you
never helped me with my case.

1838
01:43:44,435 --> 01:43:47,177
-Hold on a second.
-Where'd all that money go, huh?

1839
01:43:47,395 --> 01:43:48,657
-What?
-All the insurance money

1840
01:43:48,700 --> 01:43:50,049
I could've used
to get me a lawyer?

1841
01:43:50,093 --> 01:43:51,355
To me trying to survive

1842
01:43:51,399 --> 01:43:52,617
-and rebuild my life.
-To you?

1843
01:43:52,661 --> 01:43:53,662
Making your hair look nice?

1844
01:43:55,229 --> 01:43:57,274
-Them nails look expensive.
-Yeah. That's where it went.

1845
01:43:57,318 --> 01:43:58,710
Making yourself look pretty
around town.

1846
01:43:58,754 --> 01:44:00,669
-Wow.
-While you cut me off.

1847
01:44:00,712 --> 01:44:03,367
-Fucked all kinds of idiots.
-Oh, you should talk.

1848
01:44:03,411 --> 01:44:05,021
Do you have any idea
the stories I have to sit

1849
01:44:05,064 --> 01:44:06,718
and listen to, all the girls
wanna brag about

1850
01:44:06,762 --> 01:44:08,111
fucking a guy
on death row?

1851
01:44:08,154 --> 01:44:09,286
It's all true.

1852
01:44:09,330 --> 01:44:10,940
-It's all true.
-Yeah, I know.

1853
01:44:10,983 --> 01:44:14,335
-They all fuck the baby killer.
-Wow. You haven't changed a bit.

1854
01:44:14,378 --> 01:44:16,206
How the fuck would you know?

1855
01:44:17,076 --> 01:44:18,861
How the fuck would you know,
huh?

1856
01:44:18,904 --> 01:44:20,602
Because I know you,
Todd Willingham.

1857
01:44:20,645 --> 01:44:22,038
Twelve years, bitch.

1858
01:44:22,081 --> 01:44:24,083
Twelve years it's taken you
to pluck up the courage

1859
01:44:24,127 --> 01:44:25,084
to come see me.

1860
01:44:25,346 --> 01:44:26,651
Why didn't you
come see me once?

1861
01:44:26,695 --> 01:44:29,132
Because they told me
that you killed my babies!

1862
01:44:29,175 --> 01:44:31,308
[officer] Hey, that's enough.

1863
01:44:42,406 --> 01:44:43,799
But you know I didn't.

1864
01:44:45,322 --> 01:44:48,369
You know I wouldn't hurt them
kids, Stacy. You know.

1865
01:44:50,458 --> 01:44:53,983
I spent 12 years thinking about
it now. I remember everything.

1866
01:44:54,766 --> 01:44:58,030
I remember everything, Stacy.
And I'm sorry, I apologize

1867
01:44:58,074 --> 01:45:00,946
if I ever hurt you,
but I loved you, Stacy.

1868
01:45:00,990 --> 01:45:02,731
-Todd, please, stop it.
-I loved you.

1869
01:45:02,774 --> 01:45:04,646
Now, we made three beautiful
children.

1870
01:45:04,689 --> 01:45:05,908
-They're gone--
-No, please stop.

1871
01:45:05,951 --> 01:45:07,344
...and I am paying for it now.

1872
01:45:07,388 --> 01:45:09,390
But I'm just asking this one
thing now, please.

1873
01:45:09,433 --> 01:45:10,739
No. [sobbing]

1874
01:45:10,782 --> 01:45:12,218
-I'm begging you.
-Oh, God.

1875
01:45:12,262 --> 01:45:14,482
-Just this one thing, please.
-I'm sorry, I got to go.

1876
01:45:36,721 --> 01:45:37,722
Hey.

1877
01:45:38,419 --> 01:45:39,376
They're...

1878
01:45:41,335 --> 01:45:42,988
They're moving you closer
to the chamber.

1879
01:45:51,954 --> 01:45:55,087
-You're done, fucker.
-Mind the wind, brother.

1880
01:45:56,088 --> 01:45:59,135
[all banging, rattling]

1881
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:00,745
[inmate 1] Go gently, my friend.

1882
01:46:06,055 --> 01:46:07,578
[inmate 2]
Keep your head up, Todd.

1883
01:46:08,884 --> 01:46:11,016
-[inmate 3] Be strong, brother.
-[inmate 4] Be strong.

1884
01:46:11,887 --> 01:46:14,542
Hey, you remember that
Hail Mary?

1885
01:46:14,585 --> 01:46:17,414
Roger Staubach through
in the playoffs

1886
01:46:17,458 --> 01:46:19,416
against the Vikings
in '75?

1887
01:46:19,460 --> 01:46:20,461
Yes, sir.

1888
01:46:22,941 --> 01:46:23,942
Come on.

1889
01:46:27,772 --> 01:46:29,600
Down 14-10...

1890
01:46:31,559 --> 01:46:33,474
24 seconds left.

1891
01:46:34,170 --> 01:46:36,041
He just rears back...

1892
01:46:36,694 --> 01:46:38,435
and lets that baby fly.

1893
01:46:40,959 --> 01:46:45,224
And somehow, it bounces off
the defensive halfback...

1894
01:46:46,922 --> 01:46:50,882
and right into the hand
of Drew Pearson...

1895
01:46:52,623 --> 01:46:54,277
touchdown Cowboys.

1896
01:46:55,234 --> 01:46:56,671
Unbelievable.

1897
01:47:01,284 --> 01:47:02,590
It's what you need, brother.

1898
01:47:04,722 --> 01:47:05,854
A Hail Mary.

1899
01:47:10,772 --> 01:47:12,251
I wish I could throw it for you.

1900
01:47:20,738 --> 01:47:22,392
[Todd] ...thy womb, Jesus.

1901
01:47:23,219 --> 01:47:25,047
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

1902
01:47:26,657 --> 01:47:28,224
pray for us sinners, now...

1903
01:47:29,747 --> 01:47:32,750
and at the hour of our death.
Amen.

1904
01:47:32,794 --> 01:47:35,840
For Todd Willingham scheduled
to be executed

1905
01:47:35,884 --> 01:47:36,928
in just five days.

1906
01:47:38,321 --> 01:47:41,063
This marks the end
of a 12-year-old...

1907
01:47:41,106 --> 01:47:44,806
Hey, you got a pen and paper,
or something?

1908
01:47:46,547 --> 01:47:47,635
[barman] Here you go.

1909
01:47:49,071 --> 01:47:50,028
[news reporter on TV]
...Todd Willingham's fate.

1910
01:47:51,421 --> 01:47:53,554
This is a town of good
and simple people.

1911
01:47:55,904 --> 01:47:57,688
[Johnny] To whom it may concern.

1912
01:47:58,559 --> 01:48:01,475
My name is Johnny Webb.

1913
01:48:02,476 --> 01:48:06,088
I was forced to testify against
Mr. Willingham by

1914
01:48:06,131 --> 01:48:09,787
the district attorney's office
and other officials.

1915
01:48:10,179 --> 01:48:11,963
I'm given no other choice,

1916
01:48:12,311 --> 01:48:15,314
but to recant my testimony
at this time.

1917
01:48:16,185 --> 01:48:19,754
Mr. Willingham is innocent
of all charges.

1918
01:48:31,026 --> 01:48:33,202
They're gonna take Daddy
away now, honey.

1919
01:48:38,207 --> 01:48:40,339
I don't know.
They just say it's my time.

1920
01:48:47,085 --> 01:48:48,783
I'm gonna miss you too.

1921
01:48:50,654 --> 01:48:52,264
I'm gonna really miss you.

1922
01:48:59,141 --> 01:49:01,012
That day in the fire, if I...

1923
01:49:03,493 --> 01:49:05,103
If I could've just saved you.

1924
01:49:11,370 --> 01:49:12,371
Amber.

1925
01:49:22,207 --> 01:49:23,513
Come on, honey.

1926
01:49:23,557 --> 01:49:24,558
It'll be okay.

1927
01:49:25,254 --> 01:49:27,125
Just let your brother do
all the talking.

1928
01:49:30,607 --> 01:49:32,870
Ms. Kuykendall, what do you have
to share with us?

1929
01:49:32,914 --> 01:49:34,698
Can you tell us what happened?

1930
01:49:34,742 --> 01:49:36,570
Can you tell us
what happened, please?

1931
01:49:36,613 --> 01:49:37,788
What would you like to share?

1932
01:49:39,877 --> 01:49:42,140
Regardless of what's been said
in the past,

1933
01:49:42,663 --> 01:49:44,578
I have here my affidavit.

1934
01:49:46,667 --> 01:49:49,017
It says Todd confessed to her
when she visited him in prison.

1935
01:49:49,974 --> 01:49:51,628
Texas is doing the right thing

1936
01:49:51,672 --> 01:49:53,325
making that monster pay for
what he did.

1937
01:49:53,369 --> 01:49:55,458
Come on.
That's all we have to say.

1938
01:49:55,501 --> 01:49:58,592
[indistinct clamoring]

1939
01:50:06,687 --> 01:50:10,299
You know her granddaddy took out
an insurance policy on the kids?

1940
01:50:12,518 --> 01:50:14,433
Cashed it right after the fire.

1941
01:50:17,523 --> 01:50:18,612
She's terrified.

1942
01:50:21,005 --> 01:50:23,573
They're all running scared
after this Hurst report.

1943
01:50:28,360 --> 01:50:30,449
I asked my mom and dad
not to come.

1944
01:50:31,450 --> 01:50:33,191
It would be too much for them.

1945
01:50:34,671 --> 01:50:35,629
Yeah.

1946
01:50:39,284 --> 01:50:42,418
You know, the report's on
the Governor's desk right now.

1947
01:50:42,461 --> 01:50:43,637
Governor Perry?

1948
01:50:45,029 --> 01:50:46,030
Yeah.

1949
01:51:01,263 --> 01:51:03,047
I'm getting scared now, Liz.

1950
01:51:06,747 --> 01:51:08,139
Not about dying.

1951
01:51:09,271 --> 01:51:12,404
They said it's gonna hurt,
they say it hurts so much.

1952
01:51:22,066 --> 01:51:23,589
You're gonna be there, right?

1953
01:51:27,637 --> 01:51:28,507
Promise.

1954
01:51:30,248 --> 01:51:31,119
Good.

1955
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:36,341
I don't wanna die alone.

1956
01:51:42,434 --> 01:51:45,568
[Julie] Mama, are you okay?

1957
01:51:50,399 --> 01:51:52,140
They're gonna kill him tomorrow.

1958
01:51:57,623 --> 01:51:58,712
I failed.

1959
01:51:59,669 --> 01:52:00,670
No.

1960
01:52:06,458 --> 01:52:10,071
I let him down.
If I had found Hurst sooner...

1961
01:52:10,767 --> 01:52:13,204
No, Mama.
No, Mama, you didn't.

1962
01:52:14,510 --> 01:52:16,164
You did so much for him.

1963
01:52:18,470 --> 01:52:20,690
I guess I thought
the right thing would win.

1964
01:52:23,258 --> 01:52:25,651
I thought the right thing
would win.

1965
01:52:29,655 --> 01:52:30,613
I'm sorry.

1966
01:52:32,006 --> 01:52:35,531
-I'm so, so sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.

1967
01:52:36,445 --> 01:52:39,622
That you had to learn such
a shitty truth about the world.

1968
01:52:41,842 --> 01:52:42,756
[Julie] No.

1969
01:53:05,387 --> 01:53:08,433
Paul, I am telling you
the Governor has not read this.

1970
01:53:10,261 --> 01:53:12,698
Because it's proof.

1971
01:53:13,569 --> 01:53:16,790
Just please find somebody
who will make him read it.

1972
01:53:17,616 --> 01:53:20,489
-[horn blaring]
-[crashing]

1973
01:53:20,532 --> 01:53:22,665
[glass smashing]

1974
01:53:29,411 --> 01:53:30,978
-[Todd] Yo!
-[Marty] Yeah?

1975
01:53:31,021 --> 01:53:32,066
[Todd] How long?

1976
01:53:32,109 --> 01:53:33,545
[Marty]
Hour and a half maybe.

1977
01:53:34,895 --> 01:53:36,244
Ain't nobody called?

1978
01:53:37,462 --> 01:53:38,681
I'm sorry, brother.

1979
01:53:38,986 --> 01:53:41,162
I'm definitely expecting
a phone call, boss.

1980
01:53:41,205 --> 01:53:43,164
-I know.
-Elizabeth Gilbert,

1981
01:53:43,207 --> 01:53:45,122
you let me know
the second she calls, right?

1982
01:53:45,166 --> 01:53:46,167
I promise.

1983
01:53:53,304 --> 01:53:54,392
You all right?

1984
01:53:57,787 --> 01:53:58,875
Yeah, I know.

1985
01:54:03,053 --> 01:54:04,098
Fuck.

1986
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:10,931
She's critical, but stable.

1987
01:54:10,974 --> 01:54:12,628
We're confident
she'll pull through.

1988
01:54:13,498 --> 01:54:15,631
Unfortunately,
her neck is broken.

1989
01:54:16,066 --> 01:54:18,286
We're not sure if she'll ever be
able to walk again.

1990
01:54:21,245 --> 01:54:23,204
They're taking her into surgery
now.

1991
01:54:56,672 --> 01:54:57,673
[Todd] Shit.

1992
01:55:03,592 --> 01:55:04,593
It's time.

1993
01:55:07,074 --> 01:55:08,510
Come on, now, get up.

1994
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:12,993
All right. Let's do it.

1995
01:55:18,215 --> 01:55:20,870
[Marty]
Are you ready? One, two, three.

1996
01:55:20,914 --> 01:55:22,480
[Todd screaming] No!

1997
01:55:23,742 --> 01:55:24,743
No!

1998
01:55:25,527 --> 01:55:26,528
No!

1999
01:55:27,616 --> 01:55:28,878
No!

2000
01:56:04,261 --> 01:56:05,915
She don't have to be here,
does she?

2001
01:56:05,959 --> 01:56:07,569
-It doesn't matter, brother.
-My ex-wife.

2002
01:56:07,612 --> 01:56:08,613
I can't do that.

2003
01:56:13,705 --> 01:56:15,969
I hope you rot in hell,
you bitch!

2004
01:56:18,449 --> 01:56:20,234
You have any final words, son?

2005
01:56:20,538 --> 01:56:21,670
Yes, sir.

2006
01:56:26,980 --> 01:56:28,764
I am an innocent man.

2007
01:56:30,374 --> 01:56:33,987
Convicted of unspeakably heinous
crime, which I did not commit.

2008
01:56:35,858 --> 01:56:38,382
Twelve years
I've been wrongly persecuted...

2009
01:56:41,081 --> 01:56:43,605
despite me
maintaining my innocence.

2010
01:56:47,217 --> 01:56:50,046
It is my dying wish
that my body be cremated.

2011
01:56:53,441 --> 01:56:56,922
And then my ashes spread across
my daughter's graves. [sniffs]

2012
01:57:03,799 --> 01:57:05,583
From God's dust I came...

2013
01:57:08,064 --> 01:57:11,589
now, to God's dust
I judiciously return.

2014
01:57:16,551 --> 01:57:18,683
Then the earth shall be
my throne.

2015
01:57:23,123 --> 01:57:24,385
All right then, y'all.

2016
01:57:30,130 --> 01:57:31,653
[Todd exhaling heavily]

2017
01:57:42,011 --> 01:57:42,968
[exhaling heavily]

2018
01:57:47,756 --> 01:57:50,759
[breathing nervously]

2019
01:58:02,988 --> 01:58:04,599
[Todd breathing shakily]

2020
01:58:34,107 --> 01:58:36,718
[sniffling]

2021
01:58:41,810 --> 01:58:45,292
[breathing shakily, exhaling]

2022
01:58:55,780 --> 01:58:59,828
[grunting in pain]

2023
01:59:07,531 --> 01:59:10,099
[grunting continues]

2024
01:59:53,055 --> 01:59:54,056
Thank you.

2025
02:00:12,161 --> 02:00:13,293
[Todd] Hey, groovy lady.

2026
02:00:13,858 --> 02:00:15,643
I'm wondering where you are.

2027
02:00:16,905 --> 02:00:19,037
I guess something big
must have come up.

2028
02:00:20,952 --> 02:00:22,954
When you read this,
I'll be gone,

2029
02:00:23,825 --> 02:00:26,436
but I wanted to tell you
about this dream I had.

2030
02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:28,786
[birds chirping]

2031
02:00:28,830 --> 02:00:31,485
Me and my girls are out
for a walk or some such.

2032
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:34,052
-Can you get me one?
-No, not that one.

2033
02:00:34,096 --> 02:00:35,967
I don't want that one.
Get me-- Get me this one.

2034
02:00:36,751 --> 02:00:38,492
-Good.
-I got two.

2035
02:00:38,535 --> 02:00:40,755
It was one of those cool,
fall days.

2036
02:00:41,930 --> 02:00:43,975
Football weather
my daddy used to call it.

2037
02:00:44,019 --> 02:00:45,020
You got that for me?

2038
02:00:46,630 --> 02:00:48,023
[Amber] Today was the last day,
yesterday was the last day,

2039
02:00:48,066 --> 02:00:50,243
today we're doing it, this week,
next week...

2040
02:00:50,286 --> 02:00:52,419
Funny thing is,
you were there too.

2041
02:00:53,637 --> 02:00:55,465
Out for a walk, I guess.

2042
02:00:58,599 --> 02:01:03,125
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

2043
02:01:25,016 --> 02:01:25,930
Okay.

2044
02:01:35,592 --> 02:01:37,333
[Todd] I suppose there's lots
of reasons

2045
02:01:37,377 --> 02:01:38,682
to feel sorry for myself.

2046
02:01:40,118 --> 02:01:41,903
My greatest regret
is not being allowed

2047
02:01:41,946 --> 02:01:43,557
to be buried beside my girls.

2048
02:01:45,254 --> 02:01:49,389
But thanks to you,
I have tried to make my peace.

2049
02:01:57,222 --> 02:01:59,573
You showed me that love
is always there

2050
02:01:59,616 --> 02:02:01,314
if you just
open yourself to it.

2051
02:02:02,010 --> 02:02:04,926
You helped me to learn to enjoy
the simple blessings

2052
02:02:04,969 --> 02:02:05,883
of being alive.

2053
02:02:07,407 --> 02:02:09,583
I only wish I had something
to give you in return.

2054
02:02:10,453 --> 02:02:12,890
Besides my love, always.

2055
02:02:14,283 --> 02:02:16,894
Yours truly, Todd.

2056
02:02:18,722 --> 02:02:20,245
Okay. Let's go.

2057
02:03:12,472 --> 02:03:14,474
[presenter] Governor Perry,
question about Texas.

2058
02:03:15,344 --> 02:03:19,217
Your State has executed
234 death row inmates,

2059
02:03:19,261 --> 02:03:21,611
more than any other governor
in modern times.

2060
02:03:22,090 --> 02:03:24,222
-Have you--
-[cheering and applause]

2061
02:03:24,266 --> 02:03:26,747
Have you struggled
to sleep at night

2062
02:03:26,790 --> 02:03:30,141
with the idea that
any one of those

2063
02:03:30,185 --> 02:03:32,317
might have been innocent?

2064
02:03:32,361 --> 02:03:34,581
No, sir, I've never struggled
with that at all.

2065
02:03:34,885 --> 02:03:39,499
The State of Texas
has a very thoughtful,

2066
02:03:40,238 --> 02:03:42,632
a very clear...

2067
02:03:44,199 --> 02:03:46,854
process in place
of which when someone commits

2068
02:03:46,897 --> 02:03:49,683
the most heinous of crimes
against our citizens,

2069
02:03:50,074 --> 02:03:53,774
they get a fair hearing, they go
through an appellate process.

2070
02:03:54,252 --> 02:03:56,820
They go up to the Supreme Court
of United States

2071
02:03:56,864 --> 02:03:58,343
if that's required,

2072
02:03:58,387 --> 02:04:02,217
but in the State of Texas,
if you come in to our state,

2073
02:04:02,652 --> 02:04:04,306
and you kill
one of our children,

2074
02:04:04,698 --> 02:04:06,221
you kill a police officer,

2075
02:04:06,264 --> 02:04:08,049
you're involved with
another crime

2076
02:04:08,092 --> 02:04:09,746
and you kill
one of our citizens,

2077
02:04:10,617 --> 02:04:14,925
you will face the ultimate
justice in the State of Texas.

2078
02:04:14,969 --> 02:04:17,145
And that is
you will be executed.

2079
02:04:17,188 --> 02:04:18,842
[presenter]
What do you make of--

2080
02:04:18,886 --> 02:04:24,239
[cheering and applause]
