00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:48,957
<i>Paradise is where I am.</i>

3
00:00:48,957 --> 00:00:52,282
<i>Paradise is where you are.</i>

4
00:00:52,941 --> 00:00:57,542
<i>Call those whom you love
and invite them to where you are.</i>

5
00:00:57,542 --> 00:01:01,075
<i>This is the second easiest way
to invite your lovers to paradise</i>

6
00:01:01,075 --> 00:01:03,268
<i>who are bored with everyday routines.</i>

7
00:01:03,268 --> 00:01:06,532
<i>Then what is the easiest way?</i>

8
00:01:06,532 --> 00:01:09,131
<i>You going to where your lover is.</i>

9
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:12,627
<i>If you go, then that place
will become paradise</i>

10
00:01:12,627 --> 00:01:15,954
<i>because you will make it so.</i>

11
00:01:16,424 --> 00:01:20,619
<i>Today is August 6th, and we still have
three more hours until it’s over.</i>

12
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:25,002
<i>It is enough time to turn tonight
into something special. Isn't it?</i>

13
00:01:37,002 --> 00:01:38,789
Don’t follow me to nag.

14
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,207
Let’s just play music
without any talking today.

15
00:01:42,313 --> 00:01:43,987
Our listeners like music.

16
00:01:44,694 --> 00:01:46,193
Are you sure it’s not you
who likes music?

17
00:01:48,562 --> 00:01:51,597
I noticed you like to play music
when you don’t want to read the script.

18
00:01:51,597 --> 00:01:54,785
This is a music show that plays music,
not an entertainment show.

19
00:01:54,785 --> 00:01:56,783
Since you ignore the script

20
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,381
and abruptly change the music selection
during the live show

21
00:01:59,381 --> 00:02:03,481
we missed advertisements and our ratings
are hitting rock bottom daily.

22
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:05,117
What is this about?

23
00:02:05,574 --> 00:02:06,972
- Hey!
- Yeah.

24
00:02:06,972 --> 00:02:08,970
The microphone inside didn’t sound good.

25
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,944
- Should we go check?
- Sure! Let's see.

26
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:28,043
"Two men looked out from prison bars."

27
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:32,248
"The same prison uniforms,
the same prison"

28
00:02:32,248 --> 00:02:36,292
"and the same air."

29
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:50,029
"But one of them is looking down
to see wet mud"

30
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:57,376
"and the other one is looking up to
see the stars shining in the night sky."

31
00:02:58,222 --> 00:02:59,631
How about you?

32
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:07,298
Do you see the wet mud?
Or do you see the shining stars?

33
00:03:07,298 --> 00:03:11,407
Oh, wow. How come he’s reading
every single word out today?

34
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:14,671
We have received a special package today.

35
00:03:15,205 --> 00:03:17,324
Is there such a romantic person still?

36
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,198
Let me read the story.

37
00:03:23,275 --> 00:03:25,999
"The face that it feels like
I just saw yesterday"

38
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:28,726
"no matter how much time has passed."

39
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:33,022
"Today I really miss my old friend."

40
00:03:34,585 --> 00:03:37,881
"I request the song that we listened to
together while looking at the stars"

41
00:03:37,881 --> 00:03:39,573
"on the day we saw each other
for the last time."

42
00:03:40,893 --> 00:03:42,709
"Jung Soo Ok from Goheung."

43
00:03:47,104 --> 00:03:48,172
What happened?

44
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:49,969
Hyung Joon!

45
00:03:57,662 --> 00:04:00,488
Jung Soo Ok has requested this song.

46
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,621
A song by Kansas.

47
00:04:07,138 --> 00:04:08,492
"Dust in the Wind."

48
00:04:11,512 --> 00:04:23,836
<i>[Pure Love]</i>

49
00:04:28,531 --> 00:04:35,820
<i>[1991, Goheung, summer vacation]</i>

50
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:49,847
- Soo Ok!
- Gil Ja!

51
00:04:49,847 --> 00:04:58,498
- Soo Ok! Jung Soo Ok!
- Gil Ja!

52
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:02,749
- Bum Sil!
- Soo Ok! Jung Soo Ok!

53
00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:05,504
Soo Ok!

54
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,054
- Soo Ok!
- Soo Ok!

55
00:05:13,054 --> 00:05:17,910
<i>- Bum Sil!
- Soo Ok!</i>

56
00:05:19,728 --> 00:05:21,778
<i>I'm wearing my bracelet.</i>

57
00:05:21,778 --> 00:05:22,777
Me too!

58
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,157
Dang. You guys started swimming already?

59
00:05:26,157 --> 00:05:27,994
Gae Duk!

60
00:05:29,847 --> 00:05:32,100
How have you been?

61
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,324
Today...

62
00:05:43,324 --> 00:05:45,387
<i>Focus!</i>

63
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:50,259
Ah, yes. Actually I tried to
follow the script today

64
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:53,057
<i>[Mr. Park, find me the package
sent by this person.]</i>

65
00:05:53,057 --> 00:05:55,593
and it feels nice and awkward.

66
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:01,837
The person who sent the story
seemed very familiar

67
00:06:01,837 --> 00:06:04,500
so I was a little flustered.

68
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,334
Because she was a really
good friend of mine.

69
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,817
Hey, San Dol can’t come
this summer at all?

70
00:06:21,817 --> 00:06:23,916
He’s a marathoner, you know.

71
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,788
So he’s busy with off-season training
every summer.

72
00:06:26,788 --> 00:06:29,264
He's about to cross the country barefoot.

73
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:34,818
Running like that isn't too easy.
I'm so proud of him.

74
00:06:34,818 --> 00:06:37,702
San Dol must be good-looking.

75
00:06:37,702 --> 00:06:43,129
All the girls who see San Dol start
drooling and their eyes lose focus.

76
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:46,506
Really? What about Bum Sil?
Isn’t he also popular?

77
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,883
He is known as a mute at school.

78
00:06:49,883 --> 00:06:54,796
He doesn’t respond when girls
talk to him. Why do you do that?

79
00:06:54,796 --> 00:06:56,583
Maybe he has a girl hidden somewhere.

80
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,293
Hey! Why are you going through his bag?

81
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:02,949
Look at this! This is the only
thing you are giving her?

82
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:05,605
This is A-Ha.

83
00:07:06,373 --> 00:07:08,371
I liked the music.

84
00:07:08,371 --> 00:07:11,979
I was waiting for the radio to play.

85
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:17,672
Hey! Wait for more. Surprise!

86
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,127
What is this?

87
00:07:21,127 --> 00:07:23,004
Why do you guys look so surprised?

88
00:07:23,004 --> 00:07:26,500
I saw the magazines that you guys read
with white girls showing their breasts.

89
00:07:26,952 --> 00:07:30,231
Soo Ok. We should check
to see if these fit.

90
00:07:30,231 --> 00:07:31,814
Yeah, let me see.

91
00:07:31,814 --> 00:07:34,559
- He looks sexy, right?
- No, don't.

92
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:36,843
What the heck are you doing?
Don't do it to me!

93
00:07:36,843 --> 00:07:38,355
He looks sexy.

94
00:07:38,355 --> 00:07:41,638
He looks like he's on fire.
Did you put fire there?

95
00:07:41,638 --> 00:07:43,268
Stop!

96
00:07:45,747 --> 00:07:46,785
Stop! Stop!

97
00:07:47,332 --> 00:07:50,692
- What? We are almost there.
- You are sweating too much.

98
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:59,421
- Look at this weak guy.
- I'm fine. We are almost there.

99
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:00,817
Just let me off!

100
00:08:00,817 --> 00:08:03,414
Yeah, your face is on fire.
You look like you are going to die.

101
00:08:03,414 --> 00:08:04,488
I told you I’m okay!

102
00:08:04,488 --> 00:08:07,026
Why are you guys fighting to
carry her on your backs?

103
00:08:07,026 --> 00:08:08,301
It’s my turn now.

104
00:08:14,555 --> 00:08:17,487
- Come on now.
- Let me go.

105
00:08:29,586 --> 00:08:31,488
Wow, you are so strong.

106
00:08:31,488 --> 00:08:34,605
Do you even eat anything?
Why are you so light?

107
00:08:36,901 --> 00:08:38,696
Stop! Don’t! What are you doing?

108
00:08:38,696 --> 00:08:42,231
Are you going to do it again or not?
Don't do that again.

109
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:47,665
Are they enjoying it or not?

110
00:08:58,561 --> 00:09:01,631
- Hey! Wait for me.
- Hurry up!

111
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,902
Am I embarrassing you?

112
00:09:44,214 --> 00:09:49,379
Do you dream of a passionate love
as hot as a summer night?

113
00:09:52,595 --> 00:09:55,989
I play this song for
all those who dream of

114
00:09:55,989 --> 00:09:58,637
having a special love on a summer night.

115
00:09:58,637 --> 00:10:03,083
"Take on Me" by A-Ha.

116
00:11:02,543 --> 00:11:06,299
Hey, be quiet! The chickens are
all running away because of you.

117
00:11:10,434 --> 00:11:12,988
- So what do I do now with this thing?
- Just twist the neck!

118
00:11:13,968 --> 00:11:15,923
What are you doing? Just twist the neck!

119
00:11:15,923 --> 00:11:17,604
You think that’s easy as it sounds?

120
00:11:17,604 --> 00:11:19,521
You just have to twist the neck.

121
00:11:50,588 --> 00:11:52,227
- It's delicious.
- Give me some.

122
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:58,633
- How is it?
- It's really hot.

123
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,773
It's fun going to school, huh?

124
00:12:07,472 --> 00:12:08,612
Not really.

125
00:12:09,869 --> 00:12:12,387
- Liar!
- No, really.

126
00:12:14,465 --> 00:12:16,962
Did you watch "Terminator 2"?

127
00:12:16,962 --> 00:12:21,724
I saw people talking about it on TV.
I heard that it looks quite real.

128
00:12:21,724 --> 00:12:23,174
No, I didn't watch it.

129
00:12:24,054 --> 00:12:27,674
Why would I pay to watch
the bullshit story

130
00:12:27,674 --> 00:12:29,668
of a cyber thing dying and then
coming back to life again?

131
00:12:31,448 --> 00:12:33,384
How do you know the story so well
if you didn’t watch it?

132
00:12:33,384 --> 00:12:35,743
I don’t even know where the theater is.

133
00:12:37,846 --> 00:12:41,803
Oh yeah, is the kid from the movie
"Home Alone" really cute?

134
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:46,212
What do you mean cute? It's all
about putting two adults through trouble.

135
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:49,724
For someone who doesn't even
know where the theater is

136
00:12:49,724 --> 00:12:50,926
you're quite the movie expert.

137
00:12:54,584 --> 00:12:59,017
I don’t have to watch a movie.
I just want to listen to music out loud.

138
00:13:02,593 --> 00:13:07,725
Let’s go to Yeosu sometime soon!
I will take you there.

139
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,361
Thanks. That's sweet.

140
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:15,803
- But I’m not going.
- Why?

141
00:13:15,803 --> 00:13:19,552
- I want to go later. Later.
- When is later?

142
00:13:20,898 --> 00:13:24,588
When I can do anything.
I want to go then.

143
00:13:28,387 --> 00:13:30,362
I promise I will take you there.

144
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,854
Eat! Eat!
This meat will give you energy.

145
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:42,076
Right! We put so much effort
to catch the chicken to feed you.

146
00:13:42,076 --> 00:13:44,242
You didn’t do anything.
She is the one who caught it.

147
00:13:44,242 --> 00:13:47,238
Let's eat! It looks good.

148
00:13:47,238 --> 00:13:48,536
I did it. I did it.

149
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,705
Are you eating without me?

150
00:13:52,302 --> 00:13:54,736
San Dol! How come you are here?

151
00:13:55,264 --> 00:13:57,596
- In the morning...
- What happened to your leg?

152
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:02,372
What happened to your leg?
Is it broken?

153
00:14:02,372 --> 00:14:06,806
No, I just twisted it, but they just put
the cast so that I can recover quickly.

154
00:14:06,806 --> 00:14:08,526
Are you hurt?

155
00:14:11,061 --> 00:14:14,674
What do you mean?
It doesn't hurt at all.

156
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:20,094
Whatever. Whatever. Whatever.

157
00:14:20,094 --> 00:14:23,177
Look at him! He's crawling
and he says he's not hurt.

158
00:14:23,735 --> 00:14:26,205
I'm hurt because of him.

159
00:14:26,963 --> 00:14:29,015
<i>Peaceful times as if we just saw
each other yesterday</i>

160
00:14:29,015 --> 00:14:32,894
<i>although we actually hadn't
seen each other for a long time.</i>

161
00:14:33,725 --> 00:14:38,489
<i>That summer, we were especially happy.</i>

162
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:46,342
<i>It was probably because we met again.</i>

163
00:14:47,898 --> 00:14:56,965
<i>The water is wide. I can't cross over.</i>

164
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:07,234
<i>And neither I have wings to fly.</i>

165
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:18,581
<i>Give me a boat that can carry two.</i>

166
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:28,770
<i>And both shall row, my love and I.</i>

167
00:15:30,588 --> 00:15:36,044
Oh, goodness. The song is a bit sad.
What is the title?

168
00:15:41,937 --> 00:15:48,547
Well, it is... T...

169
00:15:53,896 --> 00:15:56,453
Hey, Soo Ok! Where are you going?

170
00:15:56,453 --> 00:16:01,124
Leave her alone.

171
00:16:01,537 --> 00:16:06,143
With her swimming skills,
she can swim everywhere around here.

172
00:16:23,544 --> 00:16:25,402
It was like that back then.

173
00:16:29,808 --> 00:16:32,672
I wonder if these kids
are listening to this.

174
00:16:45,098 --> 00:16:46,136
Manager.

175
00:16:47,553 --> 00:16:48,890
I don't think he can hear us.

176
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:52,566
He always listens to the radio
around this time. Let's just go!

177
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:04,033
San Dol. Gae Duk.

178
00:17:06,011 --> 00:17:08,707
- It's a nickname.
- What?

179
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:13,641
- I mean a nickname.
- Really?

180
00:17:14,664 --> 00:17:20,392
We called him Gae Duk because
he acted as cute as a dog.

181
00:17:21,057 --> 00:17:25,187
We called him San Dol because
he could run so fast.

182
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:33,355
People in the village used nicknames
instead of real names back then.

183
00:17:33,355 --> 00:17:36,632
Then what was your nickname?

184
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,527
I didn't have anything special.

185
00:17:39,939 --> 00:17:43,361
Is there a special nickname
for a boring person like you?

186
00:17:44,234 --> 00:17:46,519
It was when we were all very young.

187
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:51,494
Right? They were all friends back then,
but you don't keep in touch.

188
00:17:52,427 --> 00:17:55,330
- Do you have a cigarette?
- I thought you quit.

189
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:18,665
Hey there! You always wanted to see him
when you were alive.

190
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:23,240
He's here for you. Look at that!

191
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:30,313
Our eldest son is finally
discharged from the military.

192
00:18:30,888 --> 00:18:38,383
Two sons are saying hello to you.

193
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:42,947
- You should just go into that family.
- How can I get married to a friend?

194
00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:45,773
Why? My father was a friend
of my mom's too.

195
00:18:45,773 --> 00:18:49,001
Bum Sil, weren't your parents
also friends?

196
00:18:49,668 --> 00:18:52,067
Friends can get married. Why not?

197
00:18:52,067 --> 00:18:54,750
Then you should do that, Gil Ja.

198
00:18:56,226 --> 00:19:01,557
Gae Duk is not my style.
I like smart guys.

199
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,875
You have Yong Soo too.

200
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:08,746
Hey, am I crazy? Why would I get
married to that kind of crazy guy?

201
00:19:12,765 --> 00:19:14,760
The island over there
is Gaedo Island, right?

202
00:19:15,642 --> 00:19:21,737
Yeah, that's right. Sometimes you
can't see it depending on the fog.

203
00:19:21,737 --> 00:19:23,729
When could I ever go there?

204
00:19:24,633 --> 00:19:27,765
I think I'm the only one
who hasn't been there yet.

205
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,126
I heard your wish comes true
if you make it behind the lighthouse.

206
00:19:32,126 --> 00:19:34,679
Hey, eat!

207
00:20:02,305 --> 00:20:09,798
Why? It's overflowing. The drinks
taste good today. Let's drink!

208
00:21:16,321 --> 00:21:18,620
Oh, goodness! You scared me.

209
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,285
You look pretty today.

210
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,719
I'm going to take a picture, you know.

211
00:21:26,212 --> 00:21:30,561
Can I take a shower first? Come in.

212
00:21:45,656 --> 00:21:46,740
What are you doing?

213
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:48,910
What about you?

214
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,888
Where were you this late?

215
00:21:50,888 --> 00:21:56,281
What do you mean? It was too hot
to stay inside the house.

216
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:57,280
I just wanted to take a walk--

217
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,896
If you are taking a walk,
what is that in your hair?

218
00:22:03,473 --> 00:22:06,169
Oh... I just wanted to try it once.

219
00:22:07,571 --> 00:22:10,377
Why do you care about
my business so much?

220
00:22:13,464 --> 00:22:14,775
Hey!

221
00:22:24,123 --> 00:22:25,736
I will carry you.

222
00:22:27,652 --> 00:22:30,228
What the hell was that?
Where are you going?

223
00:22:30,228 --> 00:22:32,024
Just get on.

224
00:22:46,133 --> 00:22:47,564
Gae Duk!

225
00:22:49,462 --> 00:22:51,258
You guys came? Get on!

226
00:22:53,518 --> 00:22:55,722
I have a favor to ask you.

227
00:22:56,421 --> 00:22:57,920
What now?

228
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:02,316
Can we drive to Gaedo over there?

229
00:23:02,316 --> 00:23:06,483
If you go at night, your mother
and brother wouldn't notice at all.

230
00:23:07,112 --> 00:23:09,609
What the hell are you saying?

231
00:23:10,158 --> 00:23:13,673
Bum Sil wanted to go, so I thought
we were going there already.

232
00:23:14,105 --> 00:23:17,550
Are you doing that because
you think I got scared?

233
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,627
What?

234
00:23:20,197 --> 00:23:21,203
Look! They are coming over there.

235
00:23:24,258 --> 00:23:28,270
- Gae Duk! San Dol!
- Don't run! It's too loud.

236
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:33,184
Come slowly. Yes, like that.

237
00:23:33,184 --> 00:23:36,427
I thought you were bringing Gil Ja.
What happened? Did you miss her?

238
00:23:36,427 --> 00:23:39,752
San Dol! I was going to call for you

239
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:43,182
so I was walking around
your house for so long.

240
00:23:43,182 --> 00:23:46,157
Oh, man! I was whispering,
barking, and all kinds of crazy stuff.

241
00:23:46,157 --> 00:23:51,112
- Soo Ok. We are going to Gaedo.
- What? Really?

242
00:23:51,112 --> 00:23:57,660
You said you wanted to go there.
So I asked Gae Duk to go.

243
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,995
Bum Sil.

244
00:23:58,995 --> 00:24:01,453
What the hell... Stop! Stop! Stop!

245
00:24:01,453 --> 00:24:05,693
Why are you looking at Bum Sil like that?
I'm the one who is taking all the risks.

246
00:24:07,749 --> 00:24:09,365
Gae Duk.

247
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:12,446
He said he would get
beaten up by his brother.

248
00:24:12,446 --> 00:24:17,140
- So he said no, but I insisted--
- That's not true.

249
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,653
It's what Soo Ok wants to do.
Why wouldn't her husband do it for her?

250
00:24:27,101 --> 00:24:29,929
Hey! Let's go faster!

251
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:32,336
Right. Bring up the engine more.

252
00:24:32,336 --> 00:24:35,214
You can hear the engine sound
from my house.

253
00:24:35,214 --> 00:24:40,548
Oh, goodness. We came so far,
so just pull it off. Just do it!

254
00:24:40,548 --> 00:24:44,533
- Just do it!
- No way!

255
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:52,598
<i>- Let's go!
- They can hear us!</i>

256
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:41,662
Please let us meet again
when we become adults.

257
00:25:43,054 --> 00:25:45,752
We are not going anywhere.
We will stay here.

258
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:48,754
I think Gil Ja wants to get married
and go live in America.

259
00:25:48,754 --> 00:25:52,346
By the way, how old do you need
to be to become an adult?

260
00:25:52,346 --> 00:25:54,469
You become an adult
when you are 20 years old.

261
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:55,942
You even get your ID.

262
00:25:55,942 --> 00:25:59,538
You don't become an adult with an ID.
You need to behave like an adult.

263
00:25:59,538 --> 00:26:01,022
Behave like an adult?

264
00:26:01,022 --> 00:26:04,797
Yeah, then you would need to be 30...

265
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:05,924
40 years old.

266
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,130
40?

267
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:13,325
40 years old is a grandfather.
A really old grandfather.

268
00:26:13,325 --> 00:26:15,761
My uncle had a grandchild
when he was 40 years old.

269
00:26:15,761 --> 00:26:17,520
Let's make it 40 years old.

270
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,778
And we should be still hanging out
together even then.

271
00:26:21,016 --> 00:26:24,152
We should be together until then
if we're true friends.

272
00:26:25,768 --> 00:26:27,603
- Right.
- That's right.

273
00:26:31,407 --> 00:26:35,915
Yong Soo! Yong Soo!

274
00:26:36,501 --> 00:26:39,099
- Yong Soo!
- Yes, this is Lee Young Soo.

275
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:42,868
How much longer are you going to think
this is the army? You are home, son!

276
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:46,524
Oh, gosh. You scared me.
What is the matter this morning?

277
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:53,173
We are so screwed. Our boat is gone.

278
00:26:53,173 --> 00:26:55,406
Why would our boat be missing?

279
00:26:57,008 --> 00:27:00,224
Our boat? What do you mean
our boat is gone?

280
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,541
What is going on?

281
00:27:02,541 --> 00:27:06,086
Our boat! My baby is dying.

282
00:27:07,771 --> 00:27:09,369
What do you mean your baby?

283
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:14,787
The dude who stole the boat
also took your little brother!

284
00:27:14,787 --> 00:27:16,183
What will we do?

285
00:27:16,646 --> 00:27:19,858
Why would he take Gae Duk?
He's useless.

286
00:27:19,858 --> 00:27:21,557
He's probably trying to sell Gae Duk.

287
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:25,353
He would cost more
because he eats so much.

288
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:31,411
You bastard! Aren't you worried
about your little brother?

289
00:27:31,411 --> 00:27:35,467
What's wrong?
Is he your only son? Gosh!

290
00:27:35,467 --> 00:27:37,023
I'm going to kill you, Gae Duk.

291
00:27:37,023 --> 00:27:40,039
This way and that way.

292
00:27:41,237 --> 00:27:44,232
San Dol, you are obviously
good at running. Right?

293
00:27:44,232 --> 00:27:45,410
Of course!

294
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:50,026
Poor Gae Duk! What is he good at?

295
00:27:55,001 --> 00:27:58,915
Of course, I'm going to work with
my older brother to earn money.

296
00:28:00,754 --> 00:28:04,629
So that I can feed my Soo Ok well.

297
00:28:06,212 --> 00:28:08,042
What do you want to be, Soo Ok?

298
00:28:08,609 --> 00:28:12,277
I'm going to become a DJ.
You know, a radio DJ for a music show.

299
00:28:12,277 --> 00:28:15,901
- Just like Lee Moon Sae.
- That's awesome!

300
00:28:15,901 --> 00:28:19,648
You have a pretty voice
and you can sing well.

301
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,696
You know music doesn't have feet.

302
00:28:22,696 --> 00:28:26,591
It is really strange. Even though music
doesn't even have feet

303
00:28:26,591 --> 00:28:32,269
it travels and gets delivered from
one place to another place.

304
00:28:33,984 --> 00:28:36,682
So if I become a DJ

305
00:28:36,682 --> 00:28:42,343
my voice will be here and there.
Wouldn't it?

306
00:28:47,277 --> 00:28:49,068
What about you, Gil Ja?

307
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:54,464
Me? I will first find someone I love.

308
00:28:54,464 --> 00:28:59,441
Then have you ever kissed anyone?

309
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:03,638
Of course I have!

310
00:29:03,638 --> 00:29:07,374
Oh, gosh. Stop lying.

311
00:29:14,465 --> 00:29:16,522
You know what Gil Ja would do?

312
00:29:17,141 --> 00:29:20,537
She would first scan for a guy and then
choose one and say, "Hey, you!"

313
00:29:20,537 --> 00:29:22,911
then the guy would say, "What?"
and she would say, "Come here!"

314
00:29:22,911 --> 00:29:24,310
"I'm going to kiss you!"

315
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:27,926
Hey, you want to die?

316
00:29:27,926 --> 00:29:36,338
Seducing a guy is the easiest
thing to do in the world.

317
00:29:37,538 --> 00:29:39,619
How do you do it then?

318
00:29:39,619 --> 00:29:42,715
Guys are sensitive to stimulation.

319
00:29:42,715 --> 00:29:47,710
Soo Ok, listen to me very carefully
and learn. Okay?

320
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:51,831
To turn a guy on, you just grab
his waist and earlobe.

321
00:29:53,777 --> 00:29:55,834
- Isn't that right?
- What are you doing?

322
00:29:55,834 --> 00:29:58,891
See! He's all embarrassed.

323
00:30:00,246 --> 00:30:01,404
Is that right?

324
00:30:04,341 --> 00:30:06,998
Oh my god, look! He's pitching
a tent inside his pants.

325
00:30:06,998 --> 00:30:09,535
What are you talking about? Don't look!

326
00:30:15,709 --> 00:30:17,306
By the way, what is a tent?

327
00:30:24,473 --> 00:30:32,569
Gae Duk! Gae Duk! You crazy kid.
Why are you doing this to me?

328
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:37,543
It's okay. Get inside.
I will take care of him. Bye!

329
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,857
It's okay. Come here. Are you okay?

330
00:30:40,857 --> 00:30:41,856
Yes.

331
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:49,325
Goodness. Are you guys okay?

332
00:30:50,847 --> 00:30:53,478
- You didn't get hurt, right?
- No, brother.

333
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:56,997
- Come here!
- Hey, hey, hey.

334
00:30:56,997 --> 00:30:59,433
- Come here!
- Brother, the boat is safe.

335
00:30:59,433 --> 00:31:02,136
You little bastard!

336
00:31:02,136 --> 00:31:07,326
You little kids drank alcohol?
Where is the wooden stick?

337
00:31:08,611 --> 00:31:13,079
Come here! You guys are so dead.
I'm going to break this wood today.

338
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,479
Get in line one by one.

339
00:31:16,509 --> 00:31:17,747
Did you just laugh?

340
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:22,204
- You are so good-looking.
- What?

341
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:25,044
My Yong Soo.

342
00:31:32,704 --> 00:31:36,801
Are you crazy? Come here!

343
00:31:36,801 --> 00:31:41,617
Well, I'm going to undress you all
and beat the hell out of you.

344
00:31:41,617 --> 00:31:42,874
Raise your hands higher.

345
00:31:44,195 --> 00:31:48,490
Gil Ja! What are you going to do?

346
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,387
I'm not going to say it twice.

347
00:31:50,387 --> 00:31:54,584
Shit! You are just full of spirit!
You are such a man!

348
00:31:54,584 --> 00:31:56,732
We will see how much longer
you can be like that.

349
00:31:57,369 --> 00:32:00,943
Please don't! Don't!
I was wrong. I'm so sorry!

350
00:32:02,874 --> 00:32:06,871
Brother! This is not right. Yong Soo!

351
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:19,958
Get out!

352
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:22,335
Get up.

353
00:32:26,424 --> 00:32:30,174
Hey, Gil Ja! Here you go!

354
00:32:40,216 --> 00:32:42,248
I told you to stay out of this!

355
00:32:42,248 --> 00:32:44,803
Shut the hell up! You bastard!

356
00:32:44,803 --> 00:32:48,230
This girl is insane. Are you guys
dating or something?

357
00:32:49,328 --> 00:32:53,025
- Gil Ja! You wanted this, right?
- Yes!

358
00:32:53,025 --> 00:32:55,704
This is your day. All right!

359
00:32:55,704 --> 00:33:01,440
Yong Soo! Yong Soo!
I asked him to take me there.

360
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,858
Okay! Okay! Just stay out of this!

361
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:07,232
It's not their fault. It's all my fault.

362
00:33:07,232 --> 00:33:09,989
She said she wants to be treated equally.
Damn it! Here you go!

363
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:13,902
I will get hit! I will do whatever
you tell me to do, hit or undress.

364
00:33:13,902 --> 00:33:18,099
What do you mean undress?
Did I tell you to undress?

365
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:20,596
You said you will take off
our clothes and beat us up.

366
00:33:20,596 --> 00:33:24,293
Yes, you said you will get us
undressed and beat us up.

367
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,992
I know, we all heard that.

368
00:33:25,992 --> 00:33:29,389
- So undress me and beat me up.
- No, I won't do that.

369
00:33:29,389 --> 00:33:32,431
Just undress me and beat me up!

370
00:33:32,431 --> 00:33:33,942
I'm not going to beat you up.

371
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,019
Soo Ok!

372
00:33:42,668 --> 00:33:44,099
I'll carry her. Hurry!

373
00:33:46,655 --> 00:33:48,250
Soo Ok!

374
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,597
It's done. I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

375
00:34:04,597 --> 00:34:07,549
What are you saying?
We escaped because of you.

376
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:12,745
That's what I'm saying.
How can you act so well?

377
00:34:12,745 --> 00:34:16,204
I really thought you fainted,
so I was worried.

378
00:34:16,204 --> 00:34:19,938
I was also shocked when you fainted.

379
00:34:19,938 --> 00:34:23,174
I figured that it was all an act.

380
00:34:23,174 --> 00:34:29,329
When Soo Ok said, "Yong Soo!
Please undress me and beat me up!"

381
00:34:29,329 --> 00:34:32,481
I realized we were going to live.

382
00:34:33,724 --> 00:34:35,162
We are lucky that it ended there.

383
00:34:36,322 --> 00:34:38,451
It feels fine now.

384
00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:40,195
- Really?
- Yes.

385
00:34:44,795 --> 00:34:46,731
I put on medicine there.

386
00:34:52,105 --> 00:34:54,172
Sir, where is the auction house here?

387
00:34:55,058 --> 00:34:56,500
Isn't that it?

388
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,998
Over there. Why?

389
00:34:58,998 --> 00:35:00,449
Thank you.

390
00:35:06,192 --> 00:35:07,790
<i>Ma'am!</i>

391
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,688
Can I make a reservation
for our team dinner tomorrow?

392
00:35:09,688 --> 00:35:13,690
I had a sign up for a month saying
that we will be closed tomorrow.

393
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,588
Didn't you see?

394
00:35:24,894 --> 00:35:26,071
<i>[My wife]</i>

395
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,569
Yes.

396
00:35:27,569 --> 00:35:31,051
<i>Honey! Don't work too late today.</i>

397
00:35:32,645 --> 00:35:34,582
Sorry, I had stuff to do.

398
00:35:34,582 --> 00:35:36,659
<i>Did you not pay
the utility bill this month?</i>

399
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,795
<i>I got a call from the management office
when I was in a meeting. So embarrassing.</i>

400
00:35:41,455 --> 00:35:43,293
<i>I will talk to you later at home.</i>

401
00:35:43,293 --> 00:35:44,753
Okay.

402
00:35:45,449 --> 00:35:49,106
<i>Did you have dinner?</i>

403
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,639
Hi, Dad!

404
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:02,335
Where were you all day?

405
00:36:02,335 --> 00:36:05,625
My friends are in town.
It is their summer break.

406
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,801
You must be hungry.
I will get you something.

407
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:12,119
Don't worry about it.

408
00:36:14,393 --> 00:36:17,649
Hey, Dad.

409
00:36:18,764 --> 00:36:21,141
You know tomorrow is
the anniversary of Mom's death?

410
00:36:21,141 --> 00:36:22,802
Hey!

411
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,496
Your mom is not dead!

412
00:36:25,496 --> 00:36:28,809
She is the best female diver
in this town.

413
00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:31,387
She cannot die from the waves.

414
00:36:32,968 --> 00:36:35,602
If she were really dead,
we should have found something.

415
00:36:35,602 --> 00:36:38,420
They never found a body.
People are just talking bullshit.

416
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:42,236
It's not right to consider
someone alive as dead.

417
00:37:25,353 --> 00:37:27,191
You are having a nightmare.

418
00:37:32,944 --> 00:37:34,460
That was annoying.

419
00:38:12,605 --> 00:38:13,854
Mom!

420
00:38:15,401 --> 00:38:20,680
Dad is sick. That's why he is like that.

421
00:38:22,794 --> 00:38:26,555
He's sick, so he can't let you go.

422
00:38:29,885 --> 00:38:38,496
If he lets you go, then he feels
that you will just fly away.

423
00:38:41,037 --> 00:38:43,233
So he is scared.

424
00:38:46,904 --> 00:38:48,021
That's it.

425
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:10,514
Mom!

426
00:39:11,946 --> 00:39:14,615
I'm doing well.

427
00:39:15,841 --> 00:39:16,840
Mom!

428
00:39:20,736 --> 00:39:22,653
Mom!

429
00:39:24,034 --> 00:39:26,323
Are you doing well too?

430
00:39:28,124 --> 00:39:30,115
Mom!

431
00:39:31,526 --> 00:39:34,307
I miss you.

432
00:39:55,473 --> 00:39:59,364
Love is like a marathon.

433
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:04,593
Even though it feels like I'm behind

434
00:40:04,593 --> 00:40:09,374
if I don't give up,
I will eventually get to the end.

435
00:40:52,004 --> 00:40:53,582
Good night.

436
00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:10,702
People in the village, listen to me!

437
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:13,478
At 6:00 p.m. today, we are going to
be holding a singing contest

438
00:41:13,478 --> 00:41:16,256
<i>at Oma Elementary School playground.</i>

439
00:41:16,256 --> 00:41:19,353
That's so childish. Who goes there?

440
00:41:19,353 --> 00:41:27,799
<i>Everyone, eat your dinner early
and come to the place by 6:00 p.m.</i>

441
00:41:32,104 --> 00:41:33,804
I think they are doing
something fun today.

442
00:41:34,202 --> 00:41:37,284
They are holding a singing contest
in the village.

443
00:41:37,284 --> 00:41:39,144
Really? That seems fun.

444
00:41:40,681 --> 00:41:44,027
- Doctor, here.
- Oh, thank you!

445
00:41:46,409 --> 00:41:48,046
I liked the last one too.

446
00:41:49,464 --> 00:41:52,483
I really put in a lot of effort
and recorded it on a brand-new tape.

447
00:41:56,606 --> 00:41:57,639
Wait a minute.

448
00:42:03,035 --> 00:42:07,227
I told you this is really good.
You have always given me things.

449
00:42:12,064 --> 00:42:14,919
- You don't have to give me anything.
- Try it.

450
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:32,352
It tastes good.

451
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,198
Soo Ok, why are you here
bothering the doctor?

452
00:42:41,198 --> 00:42:42,634
Hi, sir!

453
00:42:42,634 --> 00:42:45,393
- Thank you for all your hard work.
- It is my pleasure.

454
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:49,748
- Take those with you.
- Thank you always for your generosity.

455
00:42:49,748 --> 00:42:58,540
You came all the way here to take
care of us so that we stay healthy.

456
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:03,133
I don't know what we are going to do
after you get discharged.

457
00:43:05,511 --> 00:43:07,310
After he gets discharged...

458
00:43:08,108 --> 00:43:10,506
He's going to Seoul.

459
00:43:10,506 --> 00:43:12,859
He can become a doctor
at a big hospital.

460
00:43:12,859 --> 00:43:16,000
No, that's not true.
I still have to learn more.

461
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,131
And I still have 10 more days
until I leave.

462
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:23,647
Three years is not a short time.

463
00:43:24,293 --> 00:43:27,089
If they say that it's fate even if
you briefly pass by one another.

464
00:43:27,089 --> 00:43:29,819
Doctor and our village are...

465
00:43:48,068 --> 00:43:51,297
Soo Ok. What is wrong?

466
00:44:00,248 --> 00:44:03,901
I think I am sick from the heat.
It's all good.

467
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:09,454
- But earlier you looked...
- It seems so empty here.

468
00:44:13,231 --> 00:44:17,385
I know. It feels like it's just
you and me in the whole world.

469
00:44:19,225 --> 00:44:21,435
Do you think the kids went there too?

470
00:44:21,435 --> 00:44:24,873
I don't think so. Gil Ja said
she has to babysit her little siblings.

471
00:44:24,873 --> 00:44:28,893
Gae Duk is still grounded and

472
00:44:28,893 --> 00:44:32,988
San Dol is not coming out from his room.

473
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:37,934
Me too. I wanted to go to
the singing contest.

474
00:44:39,772 --> 00:44:41,547
Why do you want to go?

475
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,663
I really wanted one of the prizes.

476
00:44:47,009 --> 00:44:48,540
What is it?

477
00:44:50,517 --> 00:44:53,492
If I tell you, then are you
going to win the prize for me?

478
00:44:54,203 --> 00:44:58,199
What is it? Why didn't you
tell me before?

479
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:01,444
Why the hell are you
getting mad all of a sudden?

480
00:45:02,494 --> 00:45:03,741
Get on me!

481
00:45:04,991 --> 00:45:08,015
It's too late. It's too far
from here to school.

482
00:45:08,887 --> 00:45:10,386
It will take too long
if I carry you, huh?

483
00:45:11,186 --> 00:45:13,383
I think so.

484
00:45:13,403 --> 00:45:16,355
Gae Duk! Gae Duk!

485
00:45:18,327 --> 00:45:20,476
What is that? Why are we running?

486
00:45:20,476 --> 00:45:24,015
We don't have a lot of time. Get kids.
We are going to the singing contest.

487
00:45:26,969 --> 00:45:28,889
Gil Ja!

488
00:45:51,606 --> 00:45:53,262
The singing contest is going to be over.

489
00:45:59,836 --> 00:46:01,932
This is not going to work.

490
00:46:03,534 --> 00:46:06,829
Hey, hey! San Dol!
What are you doing right now?

491
00:46:06,829 --> 00:46:09,124
Are you trying to break your leg?

492
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:31,343
I will go first and won't
let it end until you guys come.

493
00:46:32,005 --> 00:46:33,160
Okay.

494
00:47:27,949 --> 00:47:32,199
So that concludes
today's singing contest.

495
00:48:00,316 --> 00:48:04,341
Here! Here is one more person.

496
00:48:43,273 --> 00:48:44,776
Soo Ok!

497
00:48:48,168 --> 00:48:50,137
Don't be nervous.

498
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:59,837
<i>Your figure...</i>

499
00:49:01,056 --> 00:49:04,930
<i>like violets...</i>

500
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:11,702
<i>gently approached me.</i>

501
00:49:15,141 --> 00:49:19,636
<i>Two pretty eyes</i>

502
00:49:19,636 --> 00:49:23,543
<i>were filled with scent</i>

503
00:49:25,131 --> 00:49:30,478
<i>and that’s impossible to forget.</i>

504
00:49:32,824 --> 00:49:39,268
<i>The fact that we were able
to laugh whenever we liked</i>

505
00:49:40,516 --> 00:49:47,893
<i>Let's make beautiful stories together.</i>

506
00:49:47,893 --> 00:49:52,231
<i>Even if loneliness comes...</i>

507
00:49:52,231 --> 00:49:56,019
<i>don’t be sad</i>

508
00:49:56,019 --> 00:50:02,306
<i>because it brings more pain
for my anxious heart.</i>

509
00:50:03,628 --> 00:50:11,214
<i>Of the many people
I encountered on the street</i>

510
00:50:11,214 --> 00:50:14,559
<i>you are</i>

511
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:20,591
<i>the person who loved me.</i>

512
00:50:47,011 --> 00:50:49,787
It looks like it's going to be
a very hot day today.

513
00:50:51,255 --> 00:50:57,340
I made a soybean stew with potatoes
and zucchinis. Eat it for breakfast.

514
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:58,613
Okay.

515
00:50:58,613 --> 00:51:01,666
What should we eat for dinner today?

516
00:51:02,834 --> 00:51:07,561
We should just eat
a rice wrap with kimchi.

517
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:12,209
Mom! Mom!

518
00:51:12,209 --> 00:51:16,245
- Why are you yelling?
- Isn't that Soo Ok's prize?

519
00:51:16,245 --> 00:51:18,364
It is the first place prize
from yesterday.

520
00:51:18,364 --> 00:51:21,543
- It is.
- Why is that here?

521
00:51:21,543 --> 00:51:23,969
Soo Ok came earlier in the morning

522
00:51:23,969 --> 00:51:26,396
and asked me to swap
my second place prize with hers.

523
00:51:26,396 --> 00:51:28,455
She insisted she wanted
the second place prize.

524
00:51:29,807 --> 00:51:30,806
Why?

525
00:52:04,971 --> 00:52:06,734
Hold hands.

526
00:52:12,885 --> 00:52:15,661
Why do you make such
a big deal out of this picture?

527
00:52:17,059 --> 00:52:20,295
There is no photo studio in our village.

528
00:52:21,773 --> 00:52:24,451
We can ask someone going downtown.

529
00:52:24,451 --> 00:52:26,864
I'm going to make
a photo album with this.

530
00:52:27,749 --> 00:52:30,945
So when you guys all leave for school

531
00:52:30,945 --> 00:52:33,144
I will be looking at this picture
waiting for you to come back.

532
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:59,133
This looks awesome.

533
00:53:04,712 --> 00:53:05,711
Okay.

534
00:53:14,103 --> 00:53:15,810
Where are you going?

535
00:53:16,868 --> 00:53:18,745
The health center.

536
00:53:20,296 --> 00:53:21,740
For what?

537
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,961
Why would I go to the health center?

538
00:53:30,385 --> 00:53:33,884
- Hey, where are you going?
- The health center.

539
00:53:34,782 --> 00:53:38,143
- Why?
- Why would I go to the health center?

540
00:53:41,974 --> 00:53:45,510
- Did you eat?
- Yes.

541
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:48,829
- And did you sleep well?
- Yes.

542
00:53:55,701 --> 00:53:58,457
It doesn't look like you are sick.

543
00:53:58,457 --> 00:54:04,451
It's very hot and I lost my appetite.
I feel very weak.

544
00:54:04,451 --> 00:54:08,405
I am also very hot and don't have an
appetite, so I don't have energy either.

545
00:54:09,148 --> 00:54:10,405
Because it's summer.

546
00:54:11,545 --> 00:54:13,554
But I will prescribe you
medicine just in case.

547
00:54:13,554 --> 00:54:16,917
You should take it today and tomorrow,
and you will feel much better.

548
00:54:22,391 --> 00:54:25,783
- What about you, Soo Ok?
- Yes?

549
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:27,230
Oh...

550
00:54:31,725 --> 00:54:33,173
- Well... Last time...
- Wait a minute.

551
00:54:35,329 --> 00:54:37,847
Do you want to leave since you're done?

552
00:54:52,604 --> 00:54:58,164
I know that my surgery will not
change even if you leave here.

553
00:54:58,164 --> 00:55:01,557
- They will take care of it.
- Soo Ok.

554
00:55:01,995 --> 00:55:05,591
Do you want to take a look at
the picture you took last time?

555
00:55:06,289 --> 00:55:11,585
This is the difference between
the lengths of your left and right legs.

556
00:55:11,585 --> 00:55:19,399
So if you get surgery, then these
two spots need to be operated on.

557
00:55:25,171 --> 00:55:30,403
What do I know? I just trust you.

558
00:55:31,764 --> 00:55:34,890
If it wasn't for you,
I would never have known

559
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:39,376
that there are free surgeries
for kids like me in the country.

560
00:55:40,556 --> 00:55:42,554
How would I have found out otherwise?

561
00:55:44,452 --> 00:55:46,347
Let's take a look at your leg.

562
00:55:48,419 --> 00:55:51,632
Don't you want to go outside?

563
00:55:53,044 --> 00:55:56,783
I want to go outside.
But I'm going to wait.

564
00:55:56,783 --> 00:56:00,878
Why? You can take the boat
and be back shortly.

565
00:56:03,419 --> 00:56:06,677
I can't go far by myself like this.

566
00:56:06,677 --> 00:56:10,626
If I walk for a long time,
then this leg starts to hurt a lot.

567
00:56:10,626 --> 00:56:15,022
Because of the hurt leg,
the other leg is suffering, huh?
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

568
00:56:15,022 --> 00:56:20,202
It is the same as my dad and friends,
who are suffering because of my illness.

569
00:56:21,115 --> 00:56:24,657
So I try not to eat a lot
since my dad and friends

570
00:56:24,657 --> 00:56:28,307
have to carry me everywhere.

571
00:56:28,307 --> 00:56:31,248
If I get heavy,
then they will suffer more.

572
00:56:33,403 --> 00:56:35,533
When I go to Seoul
after I get discharged

573
00:56:35,533 --> 00:56:37,950
I will contact you through
the head of the village.

574
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:41,486
So don't worry too much and wait.
Why don't you get a blood test today?

575
00:56:41,486 --> 00:56:45,301
- We need your blood to test things.
- Yes, Doctor.

576
00:57:04,102 --> 00:57:07,346
- Do you want me to carry you?
- No, it's fine.

577
00:57:08,885 --> 00:57:10,066
Bum Sil.

578
00:57:10,587 --> 00:57:17,120
Just wait a little. I will carry you
as many times as you have carried me.

579
00:57:18,558 --> 00:57:20,994
Okay. Sure.

580
00:57:30,245 --> 00:57:34,324
- Oh yeah! I forgot to ask for plasters!
- No, stay.

581
00:57:35,541 --> 00:57:39,598
Just wait here a little.
I will go get it for you.

582
00:57:49,126 --> 00:57:54,235
She was just here again.
We can't operate on the girl with a limp.

583
00:57:55,321 --> 00:57:57,191
It has also started
developing in the other leg

584
00:57:57,191 --> 00:58:00,148
so operating only on
that one leg wouldn't help.

585
00:58:01,714 --> 00:58:04,484
I know. I have never seen
a case like this.

586
00:58:04,912 --> 00:58:12,235
So just tell my adviser that
I'm working really hard here.

587
00:58:12,235 --> 00:58:15,691
Hey! I want to go to America too.

588
00:58:19,196 --> 00:58:21,384
I will call you back later.

589
00:58:30,915 --> 00:58:36,608
So... she can never walk?

590
00:58:48,468 --> 00:58:49,631
Hurry up!

591
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:14,445
Hey, are you not feeling well?

592
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:21,096
I will row. You can take a break.

593
00:59:22,033 --> 00:59:24,134
- Bum Sil!
- I told you I'm sick.

594
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:33,491
So don't talk to me
and let's just go quietly.

595
00:59:58,996 --> 01:00:05,115
One, two! One, two, three!
That's enough, guys.

596
01:00:05,691 --> 01:00:08,349
Is Bum Sil still sick? How is he?

597
01:00:08,349 --> 01:00:12,248
I don't know. He wouldn't come out
of his room for a few days.

598
01:00:12,248 --> 01:00:14,586
Then we will just take him
if he's not sleeping.

599
01:00:14,586 --> 01:00:18,077
Oh, the doctor from
the health center is here today.

600
01:00:18,077 --> 01:00:19,476
Is that right?

601
01:00:20,276 --> 01:00:24,632
Bum Sil! Are you sleeping?

602
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:31,125
- I think he's sleeping.
- Then there is nothing we can do.

603
01:00:32,664 --> 01:00:34,403
Are you guys going home now?

604
01:00:34,403 --> 01:00:38,155
Soo Ok is helping out the doctor,
so we are going to pick her up there.

605
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:42,453
Bum Sil, you were not sleeping?

606
01:00:42,453 --> 01:00:46,788
Hey, are you okay? Hey!

607
01:00:46,788 --> 01:00:50,079
You guys should follow him.
He might pass out on the way.

608
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:52,418
Yes, we will. Take care!

609
01:00:55,141 --> 01:00:56,390
Thank you!

610
01:01:04,831 --> 01:01:07,976
- What is wrong?
- He has a stomachache.

611
01:01:15,121 --> 01:01:17,431
- Take care.
- Thank you.

612
01:01:28,039 --> 01:01:29,867
I will prescribe you medicine.

613
01:01:29,867 --> 01:01:32,833
If that doesn't work, come back
and I'll give you a shot.

614
01:01:51,784 --> 01:01:54,350
I can't trust your words,
so what should I do?

615
01:01:58,446 --> 01:02:00,402
He is not feeling well.

616
01:02:00,402 --> 01:02:03,619
How am I supposed to know whether
you are giving me medicine for a cold

617
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:04,977
or rat poison to kill me?

618
01:02:04,977 --> 01:02:08,895
How can an ignorant kid like me
just take whatever is given to him?

619
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:11,665
Bum Sil! Why are you being
so rude to the doctor?

620
01:02:11,665 --> 01:02:13,444
What is wrong with him today?

621
01:02:17,819 --> 01:02:20,754
- What is wrong with you?
- Look at me!

622
01:02:23,053 --> 01:02:26,150
You told me I would be okay
if I took the medicine last time.

623
01:02:27,448 --> 01:02:35,076
But what happened? How come
I'm more sick than last time?

624
01:02:35,076 --> 01:02:37,239
Why are you talking
like that to Doctor?

625
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:40,529
He cures sick people.
Why would he try to kill you?

626
01:02:40,529 --> 01:02:45,064
You don't know anything.
Who told you that he is a doctor?

627
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:48,958
Are you sure you are a doctor?
You could be deceiving us.

628
01:02:51,625 --> 01:02:52,833
What is wrong with you?

629
01:02:52,833 --> 01:03:00,449
Why is you not recovering
even after taking medicine his fault?

630
01:03:01,215 --> 01:03:02,645
Why are you going nuts here?

631
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:06,808
Soo Ok! Why are you getting so upset?

632
01:03:06,808 --> 01:03:12,004
Right. Bum Sil is sick right now.

633
01:03:12,004 --> 01:03:16,497
It's because he's sick
and mentally weak. So let's not fight.

634
01:03:16,497 --> 01:03:21,642
Guys, stop. Let's leave.
Soo Ok, we will leave first. Okay?

635
01:03:21,642 --> 01:03:23,604
Soo Ok, why are you like that?

636
01:03:34,791 --> 01:03:37,177
Hey, Bum Sil!

637
01:03:38,525 --> 01:03:40,176
Get off me!

638
01:03:40,176 --> 01:03:42,201
Are you really going insane?

639
01:03:42,673 --> 01:03:45,670
What is wrong? What is the matter?

640
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:51,391
You are an idiot too.
You are an idiot too!

641
01:03:53,662 --> 01:03:55,660
Stop!

642
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:58,404
What are you two doing?
You are about to get into a fight.

643
01:03:58,404 --> 01:04:00,738
- Stop!
- Everything is useless.

644
01:04:02,852 --> 01:04:07,549
Both you and I are idiots.

645
01:04:07,549 --> 01:04:09,647
What are you talking about?

646
01:04:10,606 --> 01:04:12,504
We are all fools.

647
01:04:18,138 --> 01:04:20,692
- What the hell...
- What just happened?

648
01:04:20,692 --> 01:04:23,413
- He might go do something.
- Just let him go.

649
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:26,764
What do you mean just let him go?

650
01:04:26,764 --> 01:04:30,526
Friends can fight. We can't
just let him go because of this.

651
01:04:30,526 --> 01:04:33,821
Was he hurt when he got slapped? Huh?

652
01:04:33,821 --> 01:04:39,690
Do you think it is because he's sick?
It's all because of Soo Ok.

653
01:04:40,915 --> 01:04:45,666
Hey. Why are you bringing up
Soo Ok here? Huh?

654
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,907
Why are you bringing up her name here?
What did she do to him?

655
01:04:48,907 --> 01:04:53,403
Why is this dude getting so upset
every time Soo Ok is mentioned?

656
01:04:53,403 --> 01:04:54,800
That's what you just said.

657
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:58,796
You are talking as if we are
falling out because of her.

658
01:04:58,796 --> 01:05:01,317
I'm not saying we are falling out
because of her.

659
01:05:01,317 --> 01:05:03,292
I'm saying Bum Sil feels hurt
because of her.

660
01:05:03,292 --> 01:05:05,205
They are the same thing.

661
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:08,786
There must be a reason
why Soo Ok hit him.

662
01:05:08,786 --> 01:05:11,378
So as friends, we should
listen to the reason.

663
01:05:12,084 --> 01:05:14,413
You shouldn't get jealous of your friend.

664
01:05:15,931 --> 01:05:17,028
What?

665
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:22,596
Did you say I'm jealous?

666
01:05:22,596 --> 01:05:26,269
You guys stop! You two
will get into a fight too!

667
01:05:26,269 --> 01:05:28,755
Gae Duk, why are you yelling at Gil Ja?

668
01:05:28,755 --> 01:05:30,366
Gil Ja, you shouldn't talk like that

669
01:05:30,366 --> 01:05:32,509
- when you don't know.
- What do I not know?

670
01:05:34,561 --> 01:05:38,058
I'm jealous? Huh?

671
01:05:38,058 --> 01:05:41,138
Why do you think she has been
going to the health center so often?

672
01:05:41,138 --> 01:05:45,413
Why do you think she was running
errands and helping out the doctor?

673
01:05:45,413 --> 01:05:48,171
That's all because she likes him.

674
01:05:48,171 --> 01:05:52,044
Didn't you see her hitting Bum Sil?
She was acting like his wife.

675
01:05:52,044 --> 01:05:54,803
They've been involved behind
closed doors! Can't you see?

676
01:05:57,319 --> 01:06:00,801
Do what? Like what?

677
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:06,073
Soo Ok...

678
01:06:10,988 --> 01:06:15,211
Are you asking because
you don't really know?

679
01:06:15,211 --> 01:06:16,642
Know what?

680
01:06:17,818 --> 01:06:23,714
That's what you told me.
You said he sucked stuff off your lips.

681
01:06:26,011 --> 01:06:29,285
That.. That was because...

682
01:06:39,096 --> 01:06:45,190
Hey! I didn't make anything up.
They need to know these things.

683
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:47,036
Everyone in the village knows that

684
01:06:47,036 --> 01:06:49,023
you've been going to
the health center so often.

685
01:06:49,023 --> 01:06:51,683
Are you trying to keep Bum Sil
and these guys for fun?

686
01:06:51,683 --> 01:06:54,957
You think these guys are yours? Huh?

687
01:07:03,148 --> 01:07:05,863
What do people say about me?

688
01:07:07,168 --> 01:07:10,615
Have you also heard
what people are saying?

689
01:07:18,708 --> 01:07:24,118
So this is how you thought of me.

690
01:07:40,601 --> 01:07:46,156
<i>The feelings that we showed
at the time were not ours.</i>

691
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:57,620
<i>The words that we unintentionally
spit out were not really from our hearts.</i>

692
01:08:02,894 --> 01:08:04,352
What are you doing?

693
01:08:04,811 --> 01:08:06,550
These ones are all bad.

694
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:13,042
Bad? What the hell...
You are the bad one.

695
01:08:14,177 --> 01:08:16,196
This useless bastard.

696
01:08:21,995 --> 01:08:23,392
Okay. I'm the bad one.

697
01:08:24,790 --> 01:08:30,427
I'm just rotten and stupid.
I'm an idiot. Okay?

698
01:08:31,385 --> 01:08:39,997
I'm stupid. And I'm your little brother.
I'm just a worthless piece of shit!

699
01:08:43,472 --> 01:08:48,659
<i>We berated ourselves
for being so worthless.</i>

700
01:08:55,460 --> 01:09:00,050
<i>We were anxious for not being
able to keep the promise.</i>

701
01:09:04,144 --> 01:09:09,339
<i>We felt heavy for not being courageous.</i>

702
01:09:13,143 --> 01:09:17,545
<i>And we were sad about not being honest.</i>

703
01:09:29,226 --> 01:09:41,339
<i>These were the true feelings
that we did not say.</i>

704
01:09:58,496 --> 01:10:03,192
What did the potatoes do to you?
They are all getting broken.

705
01:10:03,192 --> 01:10:06,589
Hello, sir and madam.
How are you?

706
01:10:06,589 --> 01:10:11,049
- Soo Ok!
- Why are you carrying so much?

707
01:10:11,483 --> 01:10:15,085
Bum Sil! Help Soo Ok
carry that to her home.

708
01:10:15,085 --> 01:10:20,459
The poor little girl is carrying so much.
Why don't you go help her?

709
01:10:32,784 --> 01:10:37,558
Why is he acting like that?
Look at him.

710
01:10:37,558 --> 01:10:41,394
Soo Ok! Just go after him
and hit his head!

711
01:10:42,753 --> 01:10:48,209
It's okay. I'm fine.
I can carry it on my own.

712
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:10,347
I...have something to say.

713
01:11:16,519 --> 01:11:20,583
You know Doctor is not
the type of person you would think.

714
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:25,694
I did not change because of him, either.

715
01:11:28,312 --> 01:11:35,384
Actually, I'm getting surgery
in Seoul because of him.

716
01:11:35,384 --> 01:11:37,502
I heard there is a program that sponsors

717
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:39,679
the operating cost for
poor kids like me.

718
01:11:40,394 --> 01:11:42,914
So he was helping me
with getting surgery.

719
01:11:43,792 --> 01:11:45,251
So I was very grateful for that.

720
01:11:45,251 --> 01:11:48,765
- You can't get surgery.
- What?

721
01:11:48,765 --> 01:11:54,180
From the beginning, the doctor had
no intention of getting you surgery.

722
01:11:56,279 --> 01:11:57,278
What?

723
01:12:00,093 --> 01:12:02,550
I heard that your other leg is also bad.

724
01:12:05,747 --> 01:12:09,103
The other leg would also turn bad soon.

725
01:12:28,782 --> 01:12:30,978
Soo Ok! Soo Ok!

726
01:12:50,478 --> 01:12:51,835
Soo Ok!

727
01:12:56,665 --> 01:13:01,459
Doctor, would I be able to walk or not?

728
01:13:01,914 --> 01:13:03,212
What?

729
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:08,311
I don't care about other things.
Would I be able to walk straight or not?

730
01:13:19,596 --> 01:13:24,935
That is... not certain
even after the surgery.

731
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:34,702
Also, even if we operate on the left leg,
the right leg is also in progress.

732
01:13:36,379 --> 01:13:40,959
Besides, you need consent from
your father, but he's been against it.

733
01:13:42,472 --> 01:13:43,526
So...

734
01:13:46,268 --> 01:13:47,811
I think it would be difficult.

735
01:13:47,811 --> 01:13:54,790
So if my father approves,
then I can walk, right?

736
01:13:55,959 --> 01:13:58,897
- Your father is not the only problem.
- So I just need my father's consent.

737
01:14:09,582 --> 01:14:12,497
Let's get on the boat first. Get on!

738
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:18,236
- Soo Ok!
- I have to get my father's consent.

739
01:14:18,236 --> 01:14:20,535
- That's all I have to do.
- Stop doing this.

740
01:14:20,535 --> 01:14:23,784
You heard it too.
I have to go, Bum Sil.

741
01:14:24,331 --> 01:14:26,598
I have to go.

742
01:14:28,832 --> 01:14:32,988
Let me go. Let me go.

743
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:38,247
I will take you. I will take you.

744
01:15:03,364 --> 01:15:04,729
Get on.

745
01:15:24,894 --> 01:15:27,202
- Let's go.
- Bum Sil!

746
01:15:30,015 --> 01:15:31,373
I want to be able to walk.

747
01:15:35,724 --> 01:15:37,402
Why is that so important?

748
01:15:39,355 --> 01:15:41,153
I will carry you on my back forever.

749
01:15:43,368 --> 01:15:49,478
Right now, you and other kids
are just playing with me as friends.

750
01:15:53,337 --> 01:15:59,436
If you go to college
and see other pretty girls

751
01:15:59,436 --> 01:16:00,935
then you will soon forget about me.

752
01:16:02,533 --> 01:16:05,929
What are you saying? Why would I...

753
01:16:05,929 --> 01:16:11,524
Whenever I think that
you won't be there for me

754
01:16:11,524 --> 01:16:14,811
it hurts here.

755
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:22,677
Just the thought hurts this much.
If it really happens, then I...

756
01:17:48,846 --> 01:17:51,643
I will be here for you.

757
01:17:53,122 --> 01:17:59,875
I will be here for you forever.

758
01:18:54,061 --> 01:18:57,355
Why are you trying to
put your body under a knife?

759
01:18:58,357 --> 01:19:00,253
I heard your other leg is hurt too.

760
01:19:00,953 --> 01:19:03,252
You don't know what will
happen to the other leg.

761
01:19:03,252 --> 01:19:07,748
What if something happens to
the leg during the operation?

762
01:19:07,748 --> 01:19:09,961
What do you mean something would happen?

763
01:19:11,044 --> 01:19:14,840
And who cares if something happens?

764
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:17,871
It would be much better
than living like this.

765
01:19:18,636 --> 01:19:20,048
Is this living like a human?

766
01:19:20,834 --> 01:19:24,584
I can't even go anywhere I want
and I am just a burden on people.

767
01:19:26,529 --> 01:19:30,118
I'd rather die than live like this.

768
01:19:30,525 --> 01:19:31,872
What did you just say?

769
01:19:32,723 --> 01:19:33,825
What is going on with you?

770
01:19:33,825 --> 01:19:38,217
Do you really have something going on
with the doctor like people say?

771
01:19:38,217 --> 01:19:42,103
You've been like this all your life.

772
01:19:42,103 --> 01:19:45,510
Why are you all of a sudden this way
when the doctor is about to leave?

773
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:46,509
That's not true.

774
01:19:46,509 --> 01:19:51,932
You should behave well. How are
you going to get married like this?

775
01:19:51,932 --> 01:19:54,225
Oh, jeez.

776
01:20:11,288 --> 01:20:12,287
Mom...

777
01:20:16,778 --> 01:20:22,173
I want to walk.

778
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:44,470
Soo Ok!

779
01:20:48,746 --> 01:20:50,044
Soo Ok, are you there?

780
01:20:54,141 --> 01:20:57,159
Soo Ok, this is yours.

781
01:21:23,163 --> 01:21:24,162
Soo Ok!

782
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:41,583
Jung Soo Ok!

783
01:21:49,096 --> 01:21:50,113
Soo Ok!

784
01:21:54,979 --> 01:21:56,861
Soo Ok!

785
01:22:00,095 --> 01:22:01,873
What is going on this morning?

786
01:22:01,873 --> 01:22:07,000
I don't think she could be found here.

787
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:19,798
- Bum Sil!
- Mr. Jung!

788
01:22:20,254 --> 01:22:21,554
Mr. Jung!

789
01:22:22,607 --> 01:22:27,963
What are you doing? Why are you
looking for Soo Ok in the water?

790
01:22:28,745 --> 01:22:30,444
Just go away.

791
01:22:30,444 --> 01:22:35,765
Let's go find Soo Ok.
What is everyone doing here?

792
01:22:36,638 --> 01:22:37,703
Mr. Jung!

793
01:23:07,706 --> 01:23:11,004
Fortunately, the body was caught
by something so we found it.

794
01:23:11,004 --> 01:23:12,723
But the body wouldn't move.

795
01:23:15,917 --> 01:23:19,314
- Maybe she is waiting for someone.
- Oh, be quiet.

796
01:23:19,314 --> 01:23:26,446
So I tied the body to hold it still,
but the rope won't last long.

797
01:23:30,883 --> 01:23:32,846
Oh my gosh!

798
01:23:34,642 --> 01:23:38,315
Bum Sil!
Where are you going? No way!

799
01:23:38,315 --> 01:23:44,093
Mom, I have to bring her.
She's waiting for me.

800
01:24:10,523 --> 01:24:14,638
<i>Soo Ok. I'm here.</i>

801
01:24:31,559 --> 01:24:35,734
<i>Let's go now.</i>

802
01:25:14,779 --> 01:25:16,648
Soo Ok.

803
01:25:16,648 --> 01:25:23,222
Jung Soo Ok!
Are you acting again or what?

804
01:25:25,269 --> 01:25:30,955
Why do you have a swollen face?
Did you cry? Huh?

805
01:25:31,863 --> 01:25:33,861
Why did you cry?

806
01:25:36,258 --> 01:25:40,966
Her acting is so good.
Everyone believes her.

807
01:25:42,352 --> 01:25:47,618
She is mad at me, that's why.
I'm sorry.

808
01:25:51,043 --> 01:25:53,428
I'm sorry, I was in the wrong.

809
01:25:53,841 --> 01:26:00,346
I'm sorry, so get up. Get up!

810
01:26:00,346 --> 01:26:04,841
<i>You can't leave like this.
What am I supposed to do? </i>

811
01:26:37,597 --> 01:26:40,295
Producer Choi, the director is here.

812
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:45,216
Producer Choi, what are you doing?
Do you know how many ads you missed?

813
01:26:58,277 --> 01:27:00,374
What are you doing?

814
01:27:01,373 --> 01:27:05,272
The girls under 20 years old
who were not married

815
01:27:05,272 --> 01:27:09,365
must be buried at that grave.

816
01:27:09,365 --> 01:27:11,547
That's the way it is.

817
01:27:11,547 --> 01:27:14,123
No way! I won't let you.

818
01:27:14,123 --> 01:27:17,757
You little kids don't know anything.
Stop bullying!

819
01:27:17,757 --> 01:27:20,953
You wouldn't even do this
to a dead dog. Right?

820
01:27:20,953 --> 01:27:28,746
What if our village gets a disaster
after ignoring the rules? Huh?

821
01:27:28,746 --> 01:27:33,841
What if we can't get any fish
or people die while fishing?

822
01:27:33,841 --> 01:27:39,678
What are you going to do then?

823
01:27:39,678 --> 01:27:41,017
Still, this is not acceptable.

824
01:27:43,642 --> 01:27:45,628
I'm not allowing this.

825
01:27:45,628 --> 01:27:48,482
We don't need to talk to you. Let's go!

826
01:27:49,624 --> 01:27:51,473
Why are you guys doing this?

827
01:28:00,514 --> 01:28:05,977
If you are not going to,
then we will have the funeral for her.

828
01:28:16,998 --> 01:28:24,416
Please let us send Soo Ok
to a good place.

829
01:28:25,489 --> 01:28:26,712
Father!

830
01:28:45,669 --> 01:28:50,889
Here... is the death certificate.

831
01:28:56,084 --> 01:28:58,056
Wow, so hardworking.

832
01:28:59,055 --> 01:29:02,136
You people from Seoul
are so hardworking, huh?

833
01:29:02,136 --> 01:29:07,229
This bastard! Let me go!

834
01:29:07,447 --> 01:29:12,642
Why do you think this happened to her?
It's all because of this doctor!

835
01:29:12,642 --> 01:29:13,741
That bastard!

836
01:29:20,890 --> 01:29:22,187
Go away.

837
01:30:56,937 --> 01:30:58,291
I have a gift.

838
01:31:02,565 --> 01:31:03,623
Take them.

839
01:31:17,223 --> 01:31:20,600
Come here. What are you? Gangsters?

840
01:31:21,513 --> 01:31:23,246
The chief mourners
are supposed to stand here.

841
01:31:23,246 --> 01:31:24,373
What do you little guys know?

842
01:31:24,909 --> 01:31:25,953
Come here!

843
01:31:27,507 --> 01:31:30,686
- Gil Ja, go put those over there.
- Yong Soo.

844
01:31:32,143 --> 01:31:36,098
I'm not so sure whether you should
do this. You are also a fisherman.

845
01:31:36,098 --> 01:31:40,991
What? What if I am
a fisherman? Huh?

846
01:31:42,092 --> 01:31:45,023
If a human doesn't do his duty,
then he really deserves punishment.

847
01:31:49,985 --> 01:31:51,654
Don't worry about that.

848
01:31:52,282 --> 01:31:54,132
Everyone bow once.

849
01:32:45,429 --> 01:32:50,424
You already sang that.
What's up with your tone?

850
01:32:50,424 --> 01:32:54,025
Can't you do it better?
You have no soul.

851
01:32:58,016 --> 01:33:00,756
This is my first time too.

852
01:33:01,713 --> 01:33:03,209
After I get practice this time

853
01:33:03,209 --> 01:33:07,508
I will do well when your mother
passes away next year. So don't worry.

854
01:33:08,507 --> 01:33:11,241
How dare you talk like that?

855
01:33:11,241 --> 01:33:14,138
That's what I wanted to say.

856
01:33:16,316 --> 01:33:18,671
Why do you think we are
doing this right now?

857
01:33:19,794 --> 01:33:28,886
Soo Ok is there because
of the way you talked!

858
01:33:28,886 --> 01:33:31,160
Because you dared to talk like that!

859
01:33:31,782 --> 01:33:32,959
Stop it right now.

860
01:33:33,381 --> 01:33:38,770
Then why didn't you say
it wasn't true? Huh?

861
01:33:38,770 --> 01:33:42,566
Why didn't you answer anything
when Soo Ok asked you?

862
01:33:43,471 --> 01:33:47,962
When I was going nuts,
why didn't you stay by her side?

863
01:33:47,962 --> 01:33:50,660
- I don't know. You damn bitch!
- What? You bastard!

864
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:55,058
If you don't know,
then I don't know either!

865
01:33:55,058 --> 01:33:58,225
- I don't know either, you bitch!
- Stop it!

866
01:33:59,975 --> 01:34:01,453
Stop it!

867
01:34:01,453 --> 01:34:04,236
You crazy bitch! You are insane.

868
01:34:04,236 --> 01:34:06,493
What are you doing in front of Soo Ok?

869
01:34:07,147 --> 01:34:11,446
Soo Ok would be so happy to see us
fighting like this, you bastards.

870
01:34:14,881 --> 01:34:20,394
It's all my fault.
It's my fault that Soo Ok...

871
01:34:21,592 --> 01:34:23,155
What is going on here?

872
01:34:33,321 --> 01:34:36,847
- What is wrong?
- It's all my fault!

873
01:34:41,182 --> 01:34:42,296
Eat everything.

874
01:34:44,949 --> 01:34:45,948
Hurry up and eat.

875
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:55,491
Don't leave anything.

876
01:37:59,508 --> 01:38:09,436
Because I wouldn't let you go,
you must have taken Soo Ok with you.

877
01:38:11,431 --> 01:38:19,462
I will let both you and Soo Ok go now.

878
01:38:21,897 --> 01:38:26,050
Don't limp there.

879
01:39:46,008 --> 01:39:48,145
Excuse me.

880
01:40:05,788 --> 01:40:09,824
I thought you didn't
decide on the last song.

881
01:40:30,163 --> 01:40:35,978
Soo Ok had recorded this for you.

882
01:41:01,271 --> 01:41:03,829
- San Dol!
- Yes, Father.

883
01:41:04,628 --> 01:41:08,120
Here. What does it say?

884
01:41:08,824 --> 01:41:13,917
I think she wanted to give it to someone.
Find out and give to the person.

885
01:41:13,917 --> 01:41:14,956
Yes, I will.

886
01:42:27,202 --> 01:42:30,577
<i>The water is wide.</i>

887
01:42:32,615 --> 01:42:35,951
<i>I can't cross over.</i>

888
01:42:37,891 --> 01:42:46,241
<i>And neither have I wings to fly.</i>

889
01:42:48,858 --> 01:42:57,286
<i>Give me a boat that can carry two.</i>

890
01:42:59,663 --> 01:43:02,679
<i>And both shall row.</i>

891
01:43:05,236 --> 01:43:07,950
<i>My love and I.</i>

892
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:22,971
Producer Choi, he needs to do
the last lead-in. What should we do?

893
01:43:27,627 --> 01:43:31,283
- The last lead-in...
- <i>The day I was hurt the most</i>

894
01:43:31,283 --> 01:43:34,559
<i>but on which I shone the most.</i>

895
01:43:35,878 --> 01:43:39,548
And so I miss it the most.

896
01:43:42,571 --> 01:43:46,580
<i>Wouldn't that be today for all of us?</i>

897
01:43:49,497 --> 01:43:53,672
You are prettier today than tomorrow
and younger today than tomorrow.

898
01:43:54,759 --> 01:44:01,023
<i>So you can be more courageous
today than tomorrow.</i>

899
01:44:02,601 --> 01:44:06,536
If there is something you didn't say,
why don't you do it?

900
01:44:08,345 --> 01:44:15,437
<i>I also am going to be courageous
to say how thankful I am</i>

901
01:44:15,437 --> 01:44:17,063
and how much I miss them.

902
01:44:19,919 --> 01:44:26,391
To my dear friends and to you.

903
01:44:30,524 --> 01:44:39,697
Gil Ja, Gae Duk, San Dol.

904
01:44:44,781 --> 01:44:45,997
And Bum Sil.

905
01:44:51,702 --> 01:44:52,925
Let's meet tomorrow.

906
01:46:00,523 --> 01:46:01,523
Long time no see!

907
01:46:02,530 --> 01:46:04,180
Oh, yes.

908
01:46:04,180 --> 01:46:06,227
How about Gil Ja?

909
01:46:06,227 --> 01:46:10,822
Why are you guys so damn slow?

910
01:46:10,822 --> 01:46:13,930
Oh, that girl.
Do you still talk in dialect?

911
01:46:14,318 --> 01:46:16,426
Look at the way you talk to
your sister-in-law.

912
01:46:16,426 --> 01:46:18,615
Sister-in-law? Is she talking
about Yong Soo?

913
01:46:18,615 --> 01:46:21,412
That's what I'm saying. It's mysterious.

914
01:46:21,412 --> 01:46:23,936
- What the hell?
- What the hell are you?

915
01:46:24,508 --> 01:46:26,550
Get on quickly!

916
01:47:38,934 --> 01:47:42,951
Finally, we are all here.

917
01:47:43,729 --> 01:47:46,846
Did you guys all plan this?

918
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:50,797
Every time I traveled, I wanted
to show Soo Ok those places.

919
01:47:51,822 --> 01:47:53,473
So I carried it with me.

920
01:47:54,493 --> 01:47:58,427
I guess you probably traveled
the most among us.

921
01:48:11,206 --> 01:48:12,303
Soo Ok!

922
01:48:16,996 --> 01:48:18,576
Soo Ok!

923
01:48:21,691 --> 01:48:26,306
Soo Ok! My friend!

924
01:48:27,385 --> 01:48:29,724
I'm a married woman now.

925
01:48:32,260 --> 01:48:38,032
Soo Ok! Gil Ja got married to
the crazy dog in my house.

926
01:48:38,032 --> 01:48:43,289
What did you just say? Did you just
call your older brother a crazy dog?

927

928
01:50:20,272 --> 01:50:21,548
Does this work now?

929
01:50:28,764 --> 01:50:30,663
One, two, three!

930
01:50:30,663 --> 01:50:32,291
One, two, three!

931
01:50:32,291 --> 01:50:33,812
One, two, three!

932
01:50:37,356 --> 01:50:39,948
One, two, three!

933
01:50:46,246 --> 01:50:48,373
One, two, three!

934
01:50:50,843 --> 01:50:54,643
One, two, three!

935
01:51:05,014 --> 01:51:06,013
Let's go!
