1
00:00:43,342 --> 00:00:45,078
Hey.

2
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,315
- Good morning.
- ( dog whining )

3
00:00:50,087 --> 00:00:52,191
( groans )

4
00:00:55,398 --> 00:00:57,967
My early morning
wake-up call, huh?

5
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:02,309
I'm up, I'm up.
( laughs )

6
00:01:05,248 --> 00:01:07,853
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Okay okay okay.

7
00:01:11,361 --> 00:01:13,262
This is for you.

8
00:01:13,263 --> 00:01:16,102
Yeah?
How's that?

9
00:01:16,103 --> 00:01:18,239
Hmm?

10
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,744
You like that?

11
00:01:20,745 --> 00:01:22,178
Good.

12
00:01:31,163 --> 00:01:34,034
<i>Sorry to keep you.</i>
<i>You coming?</i>

13
00:01:34,035 --> 00:01:35,771
<i>Or are you staying?</i>

14
00:01:35,772 --> 00:01:38,409
Oh good.
Come on, let's go.

15
00:01:39,812 --> 00:01:41,848
Red, let's go.

16
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:43,352
Let's get out of here.

17
00:01:45,956 --> 00:01:48,226
- We're going, we're going.
- ( whines )

18
00:01:49,497 --> 00:01:51,634
Okay, come on.

19
00:01:51,635 --> 00:01:53,838
There you go.
There you go.

20
00:02:06,862 --> 00:02:09,333
Come on, old boy.
Come on.

21
00:02:09,334 --> 00:02:10,635
Up you go.

22
00:02:10,636 --> 00:02:13,072
There you go.

23
00:02:15,245 --> 00:02:17,013
That's it.
You hunker down.

24
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,155
Read my mind, Emma.

25
00:02:39,156 --> 00:02:41,959
<i>Well...</i>

26
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,995
Read his too.

27
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,503
Thanks for taking care
of things today, em.

28
00:02:50,342 --> 00:02:52,045
Now get
before they stop biting.

29
00:03:16,157 --> 00:03:18,125
( sniffs )

30
00:03:29,448 --> 00:03:31,751
Amateurs.

31
00:03:36,361 --> 00:03:38,831
<i>( boys chatting )</i>

32
00:03:38,832 --> 00:03:41,035
- What's the look for?
- ( boy laughing )

33
00:03:41,036 --> 00:03:43,873
- What are you laughing at?
- Of course you didn't.

34
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:46,646
Hey, old timer.
You getting any bites?

35
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,553
A couple in the cooler.

36
00:03:50,554 --> 00:03:52,857
Check it out if you like.

37
00:03:55,663 --> 00:03:57,966
It took some convincing
to get them there.

38
00:04:05,715 --> 00:04:07,585
Yeah, not bad.

39
00:04:07,586 --> 00:04:09,153
Good size.

40
00:04:09,154 --> 00:04:12,392
You can pull 'em five pounds
or more out here now and again.

41
00:04:12,393 --> 00:04:15,265
These'll do me
just fine though.

42
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:17,168
Yeah?

43
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:18,670
We've been walking
around all morning,

44
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:21,009
haven't seen
a single deer.

45
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,046
Wish we had
your luck, huh?

46
00:04:23,047 --> 00:04:24,781
It's not luck.

47
00:04:24,782 --> 00:04:26,485
It's your gun oil.

48
00:04:26,486 --> 00:04:29,291
I smelled you
long before I heard you.

49
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:31,027
<i>Which isn't</i>
<i>difficult, either.</i>

50
00:04:31,028 --> 00:04:33,331
<i>You should swab it down</i>
<i>a whole lot better.</i>

51
00:04:33,332 --> 00:04:35,903
<i>Anything you're aiming to</i>
<i>shoot can smell you coming</i>

52
00:04:35,904 --> 00:04:37,372
<i>for over a mile.</i>

53
00:04:41,513 --> 00:04:42,982
This your dog?

54
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:45,687
Mmm-hmm.

55
00:04:45,688 --> 00:04:47,724
Kind of old, isn't he?

56
00:04:47,725 --> 00:04:50,496
Oh yeah.
We both go back aways.

57
00:04:50,497 --> 00:04:53,335
<i>Yeah, raggedy old fella.</i>

58
00:04:54,405 --> 00:04:56,374
What is he, 10?
11?

59
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,209
14.

60
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,113
14 years old.

61
00:05:00,114 --> 00:05:01,784
That is an old dog.

62
00:05:03,989 --> 00:05:06,258
What kind of bait
are you using?

63
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:07,928
Worm.

64
00:05:07,929 --> 00:05:09,164
Really?
Like a live worm?

65
00:05:09,165 --> 00:05:11,535
<i>Plastic.</i>

66
00:05:11,536 --> 00:05:13,940
Giving it a try.

67
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:15,609
So far so good.

68
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,813
Yeah, I like buzzbait.
Ever use the buzzbait?

69
00:05:17,814 --> 00:05:19,850
So we've been
walking around

70
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:22,556
a long time.
Kind of tired.

71
00:05:22,557 --> 00:05:25,093
Real hungry.
Are you hungry, Pete?

72
00:05:25,094 --> 00:05:27,063
- Man, I'm famished.
- Famished.

73
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,236
( coughs )

74
00:05:30,237 --> 00:05:32,006
Sit around for a few.

75
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:33,943
I'm sure I'll have
enough for four.

76
00:05:33,944 --> 00:05:35,445
( scoffs )

77
00:05:35,446 --> 00:05:36,982
Well, thank you.

78
00:05:36,983 --> 00:05:38,886
I think we'll eat
in town.

79
00:05:40,355 --> 00:05:42,158
Have you got
any money, Pete?

80
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:44,329
Nope.
Flat broke.

81
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,566
How about you, Harold?

82
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:49,705
Yeah, man.
I got like 10 bucks.

83
00:05:49,706 --> 00:05:51,776
10 bucks? I don't feel like
eating shitty fast food.

84
00:05:51,777 --> 00:05:53,746
I want a sit-down meal.

85
00:05:53,747 --> 00:05:55,917
- Thank you, though.
- Mm-hmm.

86
00:05:57,854 --> 00:06:01,026
- <i>How about you, old man?</i>
- Red.

87
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:01,895
You got any money?

88
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:06,536
How much money you need?

89
00:06:06,537 --> 00:06:08,840
Whatever's in your wallet
will work fine.

90
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:12,448
My wallet's in my pickup
in the glove compartment.

91
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:14,784
You passed it
on the way down here.

92
00:06:14,785 --> 00:06:16,822
That's bullshit.

93
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,162
I don't have much use
for money down here, do I?

94
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,570
There's $20,
$30 in it.

95
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,076
I won't say
you're welcome to it,

96
00:06:28,077 --> 00:06:30,413
but I'm not gonna argue
with a shotgun either.

97
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:34,588
- You got any credit cards?
- Never use them.

98
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:38,461
Harold, check his rig.

99
00:06:38,462 --> 00:06:40,399
Come on, man,
it's just--

100
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,903
<i>Check his rig.</i>

101
00:06:42,904 --> 00:06:45,342
God, you're so
fucking stupid.

102
00:06:46,844 --> 00:06:49,849
- It worth anything or what?
- <i>No.</i>

103
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,120
It's just old flies and shit.
There's nothing worth taking.

104
00:06:54,726 --> 00:06:57,363
Fuck, all right.
Put your rig down, old man.

105
00:06:57,364 --> 00:06:59,902
( barking )

106
00:06:59,903 --> 00:07:02,340
- Easy there.
- Yeah, he better take it easy.

107
00:07:03,976 --> 00:07:06,113
Put your goddamn rig down.

108
00:07:06,114 --> 00:07:08,651
I set it down,
I could lose it.

109
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:14,227
I could get
a strike out there.

110
00:07:14,228 --> 00:07:17,200
<i>They're biting</i>
<i>pretty good today.</i>

111
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:20,205
All right, reel it in

112
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,209
and then set it down.

113
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,181
( quietly )
What the fuck are you doing?

114
00:07:31,894 --> 00:07:33,397
What do you got, huh?

115
00:07:35,568 --> 00:07:37,604
<i>You got a beat up pickup,</i>

116
00:07:37,605 --> 00:07:40,075
<i>a wallet</i>
<i>with 20 bucks in it</i>

117
00:07:40,076 --> 00:07:42,514
<i>and a rig that ain't</i>
<i>worth jack shit.</i>

118
00:07:44,084 --> 00:07:45,819
<i>A couple of fish,</i>
<i>though,</i>

119
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,790
and a goddamn dog.

120
00:07:49,226 --> 00:07:50,561
You got nothing.

121
00:07:54,736 --> 00:07:56,772
Here.

122
00:07:56,773 --> 00:07:59,311
The smallest
opens the dash.

123
00:08:08,896 --> 00:08:10,665
Red?

124
00:08:12,068 --> 00:08:14,038
That's his name?

125
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:15,842
Uh-huh.

126
00:08:15,843 --> 00:08:18,980
Though he's lost most of his
color now he's getting older.

127
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:20,851
- ( gunshot )
- ( Red whines )

128
00:08:22,989 --> 00:08:24,992
Oh!

129
00:08:24,993 --> 00:08:28,231
Holy shit!

130
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:30,335
( laughs )

131
00:08:30,336 --> 00:08:32,572
He's red.

132
00:08:32,573 --> 00:08:35,076
<i>Look at that,</i>
<i>he's red.</i>

133
00:08:36,914 --> 00:08:39,217
<i>He's fucking red now,</i>
<i>isn't he?</i>

134
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:42,857
You should remember to keep a
little more cash around, old man.

135
00:08:42,858 --> 00:08:45,028
<i>( Red whining )</i>

136
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:47,801
Maybe stuff like this
won't happen to you.

137
00:09:00,156 --> 00:09:01,625
( spits )

138
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:03,195
Let's get out of here.

139
00:09:03,196 --> 00:09:05,700
- Have a nice fucking day.
- <i>( Pete laughs )</i>

140
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:08,905
Sit! Sit!
Good boy.

141
00:09:08,906 --> 00:09:10,676
Shit, man.

142
00:09:10,677 --> 00:09:12,913
You crazy son of a bitch.

143
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,854
Harold, come on.

144
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:18,656
Pete:
<i>Holy shit, man.</i>

145
00:09:18,657 --> 00:09:20,995
<i>Holy shit.</i>

146
00:09:20,996 --> 00:09:22,965
<i>This fucking thing</i>

Oh, Jesus.

00:09:30,313 --> 00:09:32,883
Hold on, boy.
Hold on.

Hold on.
Hold on, Red.

00:12:23,098 --> 00:12:24,432
<i>Got a question for you.</i>

162
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:25,802
Hey there, Ave.
Shoot.

163
00:12:25,803 --> 00:12:28,439
Do you ever carry

164
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,710
Browning Auto-5?

165
00:12:30,711 --> 00:12:33,249
Don't stock the auto-5.
Never have.

166
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,820
You might want to try
Just Guns down on 95.

167
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,657
Just Guns.

168
00:12:39,595 --> 00:12:41,665
All right, then.

169
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,568
How's that mangy cur
of yours holding up?

170

( chuckles )

171
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:47,876
He got himself
into a skunk last night.

172
00:12:47,877 --> 00:12:49,278
Got any deals
on tomato juice?

173
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,049
I'll call Emma,

174
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,986
Tell her to set a case
aside for you.

175
00:12:52,987 --> 00:12:55,323
Charge you wholesale
for it, okay?

176
00:12:55,324 --> 00:12:57,927
Our noses
thank you both.

I'd like to know if you
sold a Browning Auto-5

00:13:21,405 --> 00:13:25,278
to a boy about 17, 18
years old maybe recently.

182
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,851
about yea high.

183
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:32,358
Thin, short blond hair,

184
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:34,462
Spiky.

185
00:13:34,463 --> 00:13:36,999
You police?

186
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,836
No.

187
00:13:38,837 --> 00:13:41,174
Lawyer?
P.I.?

188
00:13:41,175 --> 00:13:42,844
Nuh-uh.

189
00:13:42,845 --> 00:13:44,914
Then why are you asking?

190
00:13:44,915 --> 00:13:48,020
Let's just say
it's a private matter.

191
00:13:48,021 --> 00:13:49,456
<i>It's a private matter?</i>

192
00:13:51,361 --> 00:13:53,730
Sorry, we can't be dealing
in private matters here, friend.

193
00:14:02,414 --> 00:14:04,784
The boy I'm looking for...

194
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:08,991
he used the Browning
against my dog.

195
00:14:11,464 --> 00:14:13,868
He had no reason to.

196
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:15,972
I'm sorry to hear
that, mister.

197
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,478
But like I said.

198
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:22,584
Your dog...

199
00:14:22,585 --> 00:14:24,588
<i>He dead?</i>

200
00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:27,493
The boy shot him
in the head.

201
00:14:27,494 --> 00:14:29,229
Check the ledger, Jimmy.

202
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,133
- Yeah, but--
- <i>Check it.</i>

203
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:36,676
Suppose he goes and shoots the kid.
What then, Clarence?

204
00:14:39,784 --> 00:14:42,653
He ain't gonna do that.

205
00:14:50,536 --> 00:14:52,104
You a hunting man?

206
00:14:52,105 --> 00:14:54,543
Sometimes.
You?

207
00:14:54,544 --> 00:14:56,580
All my life

208
00:14:56,581 --> 00:14:58,416
since I was 10 years old.

209
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:00,119
Uh-huh.

210
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:05,196
Couple years back I did
something damn foolish.

211
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:09,770
Forgot the safety.
First time in 30-some years.

212
00:15:09,771 --> 00:15:13,211
Tripped over a bush,
finger on the trigger...

213
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:19,288
- blew it clear off.
- ( thuds )

214
00:15:22,128 --> 00:15:25,165
Hurt like I never imagined.

215
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,302
Used my jacket
for a tourniquet,

216
00:15:27,303 --> 00:15:29,708
but the blood just kept
pumping out of me.

217
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:31,510
I was losing it.

218
00:15:31,511 --> 00:15:34,382
Couldn't even remember
which way the road was.

219
00:15:34,383 --> 00:15:37,455
<i>Fading fast.</i>

220
00:15:37,456 --> 00:15:40,627
And this fella
starts barking.

221
00:15:40,628 --> 00:15:43,533
<i>Runs a few paces,</i>
<i>keeps barking</i>

222
00:15:43,534 --> 00:15:45,904
<i>like he's encouraging me.</i>

223
00:15:47,508 --> 00:15:52,048
<i>I'd pass out and he'd come</i>
<i>bark right in my ear.</i>

224
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:54,787
I pulled myself
almost a mile

225
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,690
before I blacked out.

226
00:15:59,864 --> 00:16:01,767
That was his last day
on Alpo.

227
00:16:01,768 --> 00:16:03,470
( laughs )

228
00:16:03,471 --> 00:16:05,639
It's been top sirloin
ever since.

229
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,983
Here it is.

230
00:16:10,984 --> 00:16:13,020
Boy came in
with his father.

231
00:16:13,021 --> 00:16:15,425
Real snappy dresser,
his father.

232
00:16:15,426 --> 00:16:17,596
Said he had short hair?

233
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:21,903
Danny C. McCormack.

234
00:16:21,904 --> 00:16:23,072
Just turned
18 years of age.

235
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,848
<i>( dog barking )</i>

236
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:36,230
<i>( vacuum humming )</i>

237
00:16:36,231 --> 00:16:38,567
( knocks )

238
00:16:38,568 --> 00:16:40,938
<i>( vacuum stops )</i>

239
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:47,082
The name's
Avery Ludlow, ma'am.

240
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,519
Is Mr. McCormack in?

241
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:58,204
Danny would not do that.

242
00:16:58,205 --> 00:17:01,243
Avery:
<i>I'm afraid he did, Mr. McCormack.</i>

243
00:17:01,244 --> 00:17:03,013
Daniel was the one
that did the shooting.

244
00:17:03,014 --> 00:17:04,982
The other two
just stood by and watched

245
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:07,888
and then laughed
when it was over.

246
00:17:09,893 --> 00:17:11,962
- They laughed?
- That's right.

247
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,503
They seemed to think
shooting a dog to death

248
00:17:15,504 --> 00:17:17,305
was a pretty funny thing.

249
00:17:20,478 --> 00:17:23,918
Does Daniel own a T-shirt
that says

250
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,189
"Stolen from May's
Whorehouse"?

251
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,292
( laughs )

252
00:17:28,293 --> 00:17:30,663
What is it, Ludlow?

253
00:17:30,664 --> 00:17:32,500
You want money?

254
00:17:32,501 --> 00:17:34,571
<i>You want money?</i>

255
00:17:34,572 --> 00:17:36,542
No, sir.

256
00:17:36,543 --> 00:17:39,178
I'm after whatever
justice I can see

257
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:41,717
coming out of this thing.

258
00:17:41,718 --> 00:17:45,023
What I want to know is that
the boy admits to what he's done

259
00:17:45,024 --> 00:17:47,494
and he's made to feel damn
sorry for what he did.

260
00:17:47,495 --> 00:17:50,733
That's where you come in,
Mr. McCormack.

261
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:53,471
He's your boy.

262
00:17:56,979 --> 00:17:59,617
How do I know what
you're telling me here

263
00:17:59,618 --> 00:18:02,889
is the truth, Ludlow?
Huh?

264
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,492
What proof have you got?

265
00:18:04,493 --> 00:18:07,197
I've got a spent
shell casing

266
00:18:07,198 --> 00:18:10,102
that the Sheriff's office could
probably match to the Browning

267
00:18:10,103 --> 00:18:12,440
if it needs come to that.

268
00:18:12,441 --> 00:18:14,410
<i>But why don't we</i>
<i>just ask him?</i>

269
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:26,166
Hey, Hon.
Is Danny upstairs?

270
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:28,503
Yeah?
Could you go on up there

271
00:18:28,504 --> 00:18:30,841
<i>and tell him come on</i>
<i>downstairs to the study?</i>

272
00:18:30,842 --> 00:18:32,778
Tell them I said
right now.

273
00:18:48,374 --> 00:18:50,711
<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

274
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:56,355
- <i>( knocking )</i>
- <i>( door opens )</i>

275
00:18:56,356 --> 00:18:59,361
Danny:
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

276
00:19:02,801 --> 00:19:04,804
Hey.

277
00:19:04,805 --> 00:19:07,375
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>this man here?</i>

278
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:10,647
No. Why?

279
00:19:10,648 --> 00:19:12,751
You're absolutely sure?

280
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:14,421
Uh-huh.

281
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:21,000
- What?
- This is Mr. Ludlow, Danny.

282
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:22,637
Okay?

283
00:19:22,638 --> 00:19:24,907
He's been telling me
a pretty amazing story.

284
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:31,085
Told me you tried to
rob him yesterday.

285
00:19:36,529 --> 00:19:38,332
That you shot his dog.

286
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,303
What?
Us?

287
00:19:41,506 --> 00:19:42,907
Are you kidding?

288
00:19:42,908 --> 00:19:45,712
<i>Mr. Ludlow is not</i>
<i>kidding, no.</i>

289
00:19:45,713 --> 00:19:47,549
Did you take the Browning
out yesterday, Danny?

290
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,953
No. No no.
We drove to Jenny Lind.

291
00:19:49,954 --> 00:19:52,057
Ask mom.
She saw us take the car.

292
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:53,427
- <i>With who?</i>
- Us and Pete.

293
00:19:53,428 --> 00:19:56,031
- You go anyplace else?
- <i>No.</i>

294
00:19:56,032 --> 00:19:57,768
You go up to Miller's Bend?

295
00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:00,272
Why would we want to go
to Miller's Bend, Dad?

296
00:20:08,923 --> 00:20:11,193
Oh...

297
00:20:11,194 --> 00:20:13,897
Do you own a T-shirt
that says "Property of"--

298
00:20:13,898 --> 00:20:16,702
- Stolen from.
- <i>Stolen from--</i>

299
00:20:16,703 --> 00:20:18,840
"Stolen from May's Whorehouse"?
You own a shirt like that?

300
00:20:18,841 --> 00:20:21,445
If I did
I'd probably wear it.

301
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,690
<i>But you don't</i>
<i>own a shirt like that?</i>

302
00:20:27,691 --> 00:20:30,128
No.
No, sir.

303
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:34,435
I got to tell you,
I thought the whole story

304
00:20:34,436 --> 00:20:37,474
sounded far-fetched from
the very beginning, Ludlow.

305
00:20:37,475 --> 00:20:40,179
I got a couple of
good boys right here

306
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,817
that would not
be involved in

307
00:20:42,818 --> 00:20:45,523
something like what you
were describing to me.

308
00:20:46,993 --> 00:20:50,264
I'm sorry
about your dog.

309
00:20:50,265 --> 00:20:52,334
Truly am.

310
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,773
But, um...

311
00:20:54,774 --> 00:20:57,544
You got the wrong pair
of kids and that's all.

312
00:21:11,872 --> 00:21:13,308
It's Harold, right?

313
00:21:15,277 --> 00:21:17,147
<i>Danny said</i>
<i>your name yesterday.</i>

314
00:21:18,752 --> 00:21:22,356
I want to thank you for lying
to your brother about my rig.

315
00:21:22,357 --> 00:21:25,362
Could've brought a couple hundred
dollars or so and you knew that.

316
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:29,504
<i>Nice of you not to mention</i>
<i>that to your brother.</i>

317
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:34,579
Now suppose
you tell your dad

318
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,650
<i>about my dog.</i>

319
00:21:36,651 --> 00:21:38,853
I don't know anything
about your dog, mister.

320
00:21:38,854 --> 00:21:41,759
The truth would swallow
a whole lot easier, son.

321
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,430
Yeah, well I--

322
00:21:43,431 --> 00:21:46,068
Mr. McCormack:
<i>That's just about enough, Ludlow.</i>

323
00:21:46,069 --> 00:21:48,137
<i>They said</i>
<i>they didn't do it.</i>

324
00:21:48,138 --> 00:21:50,008
And if they said they
didn't do it,

325
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:51,812
they didn't do it
and that's that.

326
00:21:51,813 --> 00:21:54,416
I guess you're
just mistaken.

327
00:21:56,787 --> 00:21:58,090
Well, I asked you.

328
00:21:58,091 --> 00:21:59,960
Excuse me?

329
00:21:59,961 --> 00:22:02,331
I said I asked you.

330
00:22:02,332 --> 00:22:05,803
- Asked me what, sir?
- <i>To do the right thing here.</i>

331
00:22:05,804 --> 00:22:07,807
It could have been
the right thing maybe,

332
00:22:07,808 --> 00:22:09,143
if it had been
the right boys.

333
00:22:09,144 --> 00:22:11,548
Oh, I've got the right boys,
Mr. McCormack.

334
00:22:13,051 --> 00:22:15,387
It's you who've got
the wrong boys.

335
00:22:15,388 --> 00:22:18,695
<i>And I think</i>
<i>you probably know that.</i>

336
00:22:18,696 --> 00:22:21,198
Thank you for your time.

337
00:22:45,645 --> 00:22:47,848
Yeah.

338
00:22:49,685 --> 00:22:52,323
10 days, $100.

339
00:22:52,324 --> 00:22:54,193
What?

340
00:22:54,194 --> 00:22:56,864
You can't prove
attempted robbery.

341
00:22:56,865 --> 00:22:58,835
It's just your word
against theirs.

342
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:02,207
So what you've got is a case
of cruelty to animals.

343
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:04,545
Maybe reckless conduct
with a firearm.

344
00:23:04,546 --> 00:23:07,317
- Misdemeanors.
- Misdemeanors? Jesus.

345
00:23:07,318 --> 00:23:10,522
Under the law an animal
is just property.

346
00:23:10,523 --> 00:23:12,727
They have a mandatory
$100 fine.

347
00:23:15,066 --> 00:23:18,071
He didn't just give
the dog a kick, Sam.

348
00:23:18,072 --> 00:23:19,672
He killed it.

349
00:23:19,673 --> 00:23:22,278
It's still just cruelty
to animals, Ave.

350
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:25,049
That's all the law
has to say about it.

351
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:29,658
You can ask for up to
364 days in prison,

352
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:31,629
but practically speaking,

353
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:35,135
no prosecutor in his right mind
is going to request more than 30.

354
00:23:35,136 --> 00:23:37,038
And he wouldn't get
more than 10.

355
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,442
The Sheriff could
at least arrest him,

356
00:23:39,443 --> 00:23:41,613
put the fear of God into
the little son of a bitch.

357
00:23:41,614 --> 00:23:43,851
To arrest the little
son of a bitch,

358
00:23:43,852 --> 00:23:46,189
the Sheriff would've had to
have seen him pull the trigger.

359
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,595
I'm sorry, Ave.
It's no good.

360
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:51,898
I still have to try.

361
00:23:54,137 --> 00:23:57,008
All of this time,
work and expense

362
00:23:57,009 --> 00:23:59,279
for an old mongrel dog
you already buried?

363
00:24:02,018 --> 00:24:04,590
That really what you want?

364
00:24:04,591 --> 00:24:06,794
That old mongrel dog

365
00:24:06,795 --> 00:24:10,166
was Mary's gift to me
for my 50th birthday, Sam.

366
00:24:12,004 --> 00:24:15,476
And they made a joke
about killing him.

367
00:24:15,477 --> 00:24:17,880
<i>( radio playing )</i>

368
00:24:24,895 --> 00:24:27,097
There he is.

369
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:28,901
Hey.

370
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:37,851
Where's the old mutt?

371
00:24:42,459 --> 00:24:44,462
He's gone, Emma.

372
00:24:44,463 --> 00:24:46,300
Gone?

373
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:52,711
A boy shot him

374
00:24:52,712 --> 00:24:55,349
Back by Miller's Bend

375
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,451
On Sunday.

376
00:25:04,767 --> 00:25:07,638
Oh My Lord.

377
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:10,711
- Why would--
- There wasn't any sense to it.

378
00:25:10,712 --> 00:25:13,550
Just meanness.

379
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:25,605
<i>( creaking )</i>

380
00:25:34,188 --> 00:25:37,027
<i>( car engine starts )</i>

381
00:25:37,028 --> 00:25:38,896
<i>( tires squeal )</i>

382
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:20,272
Sam: <i>You know, Ave, last time</i>
<i>we talked it got me thinking.</i>

383
00:26:20,273 --> 00:26:23,611
<i>I know how much that dog</i>
<i>meant to you,</i>

384
00:26:23,612 --> 00:26:26,550
<i>especially after what happened
with Mary and the boys.</i>

385
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:28,655
Will they prosecute?

386
00:26:28,656 --> 00:26:31,459
All I could get out of them
was a "we'll see."

387
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,465
Which I guess is better
than a "no way."

388
00:26:34,466 --> 00:26:37,037
I'll be over as soon as
I check with Emma.

389
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:38,773
<i>Fine.</i>

390
00:26:38,774 --> 00:26:41,077
<i>I found out a few things</i>
<i>about McCormack.</i>

391
00:26:41,078 --> 00:26:43,582
- Uh-huh.
- <i>Yeah, he made his</i> money in trucking

392
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:45,085
<i>just like his daddy.</i>

393
00:26:45,086 --> 00:26:47,488
<i>He had some run-ins with</i>
<i>the law when he was younger.</i>

394
00:26:47,489 --> 00:26:50,194
<i>There was some talk</i>
<i>about government payoffs.</i>

395
00:26:50,195 --> 00:26:53,233
<i>Oh, married a beauty queen.</i>
<i>You see her out there?</i>

396
00:26:53,234 --> 00:26:54,870
Sure did.

397
00:26:54,871 --> 00:26:56,806
<i>Yeah, he married</i>
<i>pretty well,</i>

398
00:26:56,807 --> 00:26:59,011
<i>But I'm not sure he</i>
<i>treats her that good.</i>

399
00:26:59,012 --> 00:27:01,682
<i>Anyway, all in all,</i>
<i>there's plenty of money</i>

400
00:27:01,683 --> 00:27:03,419
<i>and political clout there.</i>

401
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,223
<i>But underneath, McCormack
is nothing but a redneck</i>

402
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:07,760
<i>one generation removed.</i>

403
00:27:07,761 --> 00:27:10,432
Oh, I also think

404
00:27:10,433 --> 00:27:12,802
I've found out
who your third boy is.

405
00:27:12,803 --> 00:27:15,173
<i>Word is Danny</i>
<i>and Harold hang out</i>

406
00:27:15,174 --> 00:27:17,144
<i>with a kid</i>
<i>named Pete Doust.</i>

407
00:27:21,052 --> 00:27:22,888
Man:
<i>Don't move shit around.</i>

408
00:27:22,889 --> 00:27:25,092
<i>With your sewing crap</i>
<i>in the way</i>

409
00:27:25,093 --> 00:27:27,196
<i>I can't find</i>
<i>the remote control.</i>

410
00:27:27,197 --> 00:27:29,633
Woman:
<i>Hey, open the door.</i>

411
00:27:33,141 --> 00:27:34,142
Mr. Doust?

412
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,550
- I'm Avery Ludlow.
- I know who you are, sir.

413
00:27:40,722 --> 00:27:42,892
I guess you talked
to Mr. McCormack then.

414
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:49,770
Mr. McCormack don't talk to
no out-of-work carpenter.

415
00:27:49,771 --> 00:27:53,078
His boy called my boy.

416
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,579
And?

417
00:27:56,284 --> 00:27:59,021
And what?

418
00:27:59,022 --> 00:28:01,893
<i>Oh, Mr. Ludlow...</i>

419
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:06,434
Petey says they drove
out to Jenny Lind,

420
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,205
They hung out there,

421
00:28:08,206 --> 00:28:11,043
even bought
a couple CDs there.

422
00:28:11,044 --> 00:28:13,915
Goddamn expensive
couple CDs.

423
00:28:13,916 --> 00:28:17,455
Didn't say nothing
about no shotgun

424
00:28:17,456 --> 00:28:19,525
or no old dog.

425
00:28:21,997 --> 00:28:25,537
Maybe they did drive to
Jenny Lind before or after,

426
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:27,740
but at about 4:00
in the afternoon

427
00:28:27,741 --> 00:28:29,511
they were
at Miller's Bend.

428
00:28:29,512 --> 00:28:32,450
And when they didn't get
the money they wanted from me

429
00:28:32,451 --> 00:28:36,289
Danny McCormack
shot my dog.

430
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,326
And your son stood there
with him

431
00:28:38,327 --> 00:28:40,697
laughing about it.

432
00:28:42,602 --> 00:28:46,074
- Look--
- No, hey, Mr. Lud-- Ludlow.

433
00:28:46,075 --> 00:28:49,648
I heard every word of this

434
00:28:49,649 --> 00:28:51,785
and I want to know

435
00:28:51,786 --> 00:28:54,690
just what you think you're
doing coming out here like this?

436
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,128
I mean, if you have a
complaint with the McCormacks

437
00:28:57,129 --> 00:29:00,101
why don't you just
take it up with them?

438
00:29:00,102 --> 00:29:03,841
You heard that your boy was
party to attempted robbery?

439
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:07,314
That he thought it was funny
that his friend

440
00:29:07,315 --> 00:29:09,217
<i>shot my animal?</i>

441
00:29:09,218 --> 00:29:10,987
He didn't shoot your dog.

442
00:29:10,988 --> 00:29:14,727
He was there.
He saw the boy who did.

443
00:29:14,728 --> 00:29:17,632
<i>I want him to say that.</i>

444
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:20,271
Maybe he's sorry.

445
00:29:20,272 --> 00:29:22,575
You ever think of that?

446
00:29:22,576 --> 00:29:25,180
How can he be sorry

447
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:26,983
if he denies it happened?

448
00:29:33,997 --> 00:29:35,900
You're right.

449
00:29:37,703 --> 00:29:40,241
It wasn't your boy
who fired the weapon.

450
00:29:41,745 --> 00:29:43,580
And I'd be willing
to forgive him

451
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:47,555
if he'd only show
some nerve and decency

452
00:29:47,556 --> 00:29:49,659
and own up
to his part in it

453
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,229
and tell the Sheriff

454
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,501
what Danny McCormack did.

455
00:29:59,176 --> 00:30:01,012
This is my phone number.

456
00:30:03,618 --> 00:30:06,556
I know a boy can be hard
in his heart sometimes

457
00:30:06,557 --> 00:30:09,061
and regret it later on.

458
00:30:09,062 --> 00:30:11,432
<i>I only want</i>
<i>the truth from him.</i>

459
00:30:12,768 --> 00:30:14,438
Tell him to do what's right.

460
00:30:17,444 --> 00:30:18,478
That's all I'm asking.

461
00:30:26,026 --> 00:30:29,198
<i>( car horn blaring )</i>

462
00:30:36,312 --> 00:30:38,682
Got a pie cooling
in the back, Ave.

463
00:30:38,683 --> 00:30:41,119
Might make this go down
a lot easier.

464
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,689
That'll be nice, Gloria.
Thank you.

465
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,568
- Evening, Sam.
- Gloria.

466
00:30:48,569 --> 00:30:51,639
Ave, this is
Carrie Donnel

467
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,609
from KPZS News over
in Portland.

468
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:56,748
- Mrs. Donnel.
- Carrie will be just fine, thank you.

469
00:30:56,749 --> 00:30:58,986
I'm sorry to hear about Red.

470
00:31:01,258 --> 00:31:03,528
I've got an idea
I want to run past you--

471
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,898
A modified course
of action.

472
00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:07,802
What about the present
course of action?

473
00:31:07,803 --> 00:31:10,574
Well, Jack Wentz declined
to prosecute

474
00:31:10,575 --> 00:31:13,312
<i>and McCormack's already</i>
<i>got himself a lawyer.</i>

475
00:31:13,313 --> 00:31:15,650
<i>A fella by the name of Cummings.</i>
<i>He's good.</i>

476
00:31:15,651 --> 00:31:18,288
<i>Did you--</i>

477
00:31:18,289 --> 00:31:21,261
did you ever throw Danny
McCormack out of your store?

478
00:31:21,262 --> 00:31:23,631
I never laid eyes
on him before Sunday.

479
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,835
<i>What they're saying</i>
<i>is you did.</i>

480
00:31:25,836 --> 00:31:29,009
That you threw him out for
trying to steal a penknife

481
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:31,445
a few months back
or some damn thing.

482
00:31:31,446 --> 00:31:33,583
<i>They're trying to make out</i>
<i>like you're some kind of crank</i>

483
00:31:33,584 --> 00:31:35,320
<i>who's got a grudge</i>
<i>against Danny.</i>

484
00:31:35,321 --> 00:31:36,722
What about their father?

485
00:31:36,723 --> 00:31:38,892
<i>He's backing them up,</i>
<i>lying all the way.</i>

486
00:31:38,893 --> 00:31:40,562
<i>They've closed ranks, Ave.</i>

487
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,102
So they got an anonymous
phone call

488
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:46,307
in the Sheriff's office,

489
00:31:46,308 --> 00:31:49,011
went down
to investigate it.

490
00:31:49,012 --> 00:31:52,919
They found two dogs
barely alive

491
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,722
chained outside
in the yard.

492
00:31:54,723 --> 00:31:56,058
It was the dead
of winter,

493
00:31:56,059 --> 00:31:57,894
no food, no water.

494
00:31:57,895 --> 00:32:01,301
The owner had been on vacation
in Florida for a week.

495
00:32:01,302 --> 00:32:04,707
Now the D.A. wasn't going
to prosecute the case

496
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:07,479
until the local papers
got hold of it.

497
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,450
Then she changed her mind.

498
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,222
How are you guys
doing over here?

499
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:14,926
That pie's still waiting
on you in the back, Ave.

500
00:32:14,927 --> 00:32:16,796
<i>Oh, sure, Gloria.</i>
<i>Sure.</i>

501
00:32:16,797 --> 00:32:18,934
<i>Maybe in a minute, huh?</i>

502
00:32:18,935 --> 00:32:22,006
Are you saying you want to
report all this

503
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:23,608
<i>on television?</i>

504
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:26,781
I want you to report it,
Mr. Ludlow.

505
00:32:26,782 --> 00:32:29,919
I want to take a film crew
down to where it happened.

506
00:32:33,127 --> 00:32:35,564
Well, what about slander?

507
00:32:35,565 --> 00:32:37,501
You won't name any names.

508
00:32:37,502 --> 00:32:40,306
You're just going to tell
your story.

509
00:32:40,307 --> 00:32:42,643
What those boys did

510
00:32:42,644 --> 00:32:45,316
and what the D.A.'s Office
isn't willing to do,

511
00:32:45,317 --> 00:32:47,085
I want to piss people off
about it.

512
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:56,636
I don't suppose you have

513
00:32:56,637 --> 00:33:00,410
a dog, do you, Carrie?

514
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:02,379
Cats.

515
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,218
- Cats?
- Cats, Mr. Ludlow. Three of them.

516
00:33:08,693 --> 00:33:10,627
Ave will do
just fine, Carrie.

517
00:33:13,067 --> 00:33:15,771
- I was sitting down here.
- Oh, is that right?

518
00:33:15,772 --> 00:33:19,211
That's where we usually
get the best catch.

519
00:33:19,212 --> 00:33:20,880
So this is where you were?

520
00:33:20,881 --> 00:33:23,285
Dave, I think you can
just set up over here.

521
00:33:23,286 --> 00:33:27,326
Red, he knew this lake
like his front paws.

522
00:33:27,327 --> 00:33:31,701
And he was sitting
just here.

523
00:33:31,702 --> 00:33:34,205
That's where he sat.

524
00:33:35,876 --> 00:33:37,644
And the boys...

525
00:34:01,322 --> 00:34:04,027
Sam said you didn't have a T.V. and
I wouldn't want you to miss the show.

526
00:34:07,668 --> 00:34:10,605
This thing's heavy.
You want to get the door for me?

527
00:34:10,606 --> 00:34:11,841
Oh, let me help you
with that.

528
00:34:11,842 --> 00:34:13,811
Oh no, I appreciate
the chivalry, Ave,

529
00:34:13,812 --> 00:34:16,283
But the door
will be just fine.

530
00:34:16,284 --> 00:34:18,220
- Okay.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

531
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,495
( sighs )

532
00:34:25,801 --> 00:34:28,706
So the report ran a few hours
ago, but they're gonna replay it.

533
00:34:28,707 --> 00:34:30,676
- Oh.
- So where's your cable connection?

534
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,984
Right, no T.V.

535
00:34:34,985 --> 00:34:37,922
Uh, do you have
any wire hangers?

536
00:34:37,923 --> 00:34:40,895
- Wire hangers?
- Yeah.

537
00:34:40,896 --> 00:34:43,733
Uh, yes.
Try the closet.

538
00:35:15,693 --> 00:35:18,431
Found one.

539
00:35:18,432 --> 00:35:20,300
You were a soldier?

540
00:35:20,301 --> 00:35:22,304
Mmm-hmm.

541
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:32,623
Carrie: <i>And the dog was a
birthday gift from your wife?</i>

542
00:35:32,624 --> 00:35:34,693
Avery:
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

543
00:35:34,694 --> 00:35:38,401
<i>About 13 years ago.</i>

544
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:41,773
And your wife Mary,
she's gone now, isn't she?

545
00:35:41,774 --> 00:35:45,146
Avery:
<i>Uh-huh, a couple years after that.</i>

546
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:52,460
She never did get to see
Red fully grown.

547
00:35:54,097 --> 00:35:55,599
Carrie:
<i>So far the District Attorney</i>

548
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,769
<i>has refused</i>
<i>to prosecute the case.</i>

549
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:01,343
<i>Nationwide for the killing</i>
<i>and violent abuse of animals,</i>

550
00:36:01,344 --> 00:36:03,514
<i>offenders are fined</i>
<i>on average</i>

551
00:36:03,515 --> 00:36:07,053
<i>only 32%</i>
<i>of the maximum fine possible</i>

552
00:36:07,054 --> 00:36:11,027
<i>and have spent a mere 14%</i>
<i>of the maximum jail time.</i>

553
00:36:11,028 --> 00:36:13,800
<i>Most offenders never</i>
<i>even come to trial.</i>

554
00:36:15,704 --> 00:36:18,775
It has been said that
the greatness of a nation

555
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:21,413
and its moral progress
can be measured

556
00:36:21,414 --> 00:36:24,585
<i>by the way it treats</i>
<i>its animals.</i>

557
00:36:24,586 --> 00:36:27,024
Here in York County
it might also be measured

558
00:36:27,025 --> 00:36:28,760
by the justice it seeks

559
00:36:28,761 --> 00:36:32,167
<i>for Avery Alan Ludlow</i>
<i>and his dog Red.</i>

560
00:36:32,168 --> 00:36:35,138
<i>This is Carrie Donnel</i>
<i>reporting for KPZS...</i>

561
00:36:36,576 --> 00:36:38,913
So what do you think?

562
00:36:38,914 --> 00:36:42,786
Well, I don't know
if it'll do any good,

563
00:36:42,787 --> 00:36:45,692
but what you said,

564
00:36:45,693 --> 00:36:48,496
you certainly said it well.

565
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:51,168
And that means a lot to me.

566
00:36:55,211 --> 00:36:56,711
<i>( man coughs )</i>

567
00:36:56,712 --> 00:36:58,715
( Carrie screams )

568
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,652
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

569
00:37:00,653 --> 00:37:02,990
( car engine revs )

570
00:37:16,649 --> 00:37:19,888
Well, we certainly got
their attention.

571
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,565
Carrie:
<i>Well.</i>

572
00:37:25,566 --> 00:37:29,505
This McCormack son of a bitch
has got one long reach.

573
00:37:29,506 --> 00:37:32,143
The D.A. is still declining
to prosecute.

574
00:37:32,144 --> 00:37:34,047
After last night?

575
00:37:34,048 --> 00:37:36,586
Well, there are no prints
on the rock or the note.

576
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,388
Anybody could have
done it.

577
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:41,027
- Nobody else had reason to.
- You know that and I know that.

578
00:37:41,028 --> 00:37:42,964
The court's
a different story.

579
00:37:42,965 --> 00:37:46,436
But that note implied a threat.
Maybe that'll help, Sam.

580
00:37:46,437 --> 00:37:48,874
Not necessarily.
But what it could mean

581
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:51,680
is that Carrie had better
call into work ASAP.

582
00:37:53,384 --> 00:37:55,018
Right.

583
00:37:57,057 --> 00:37:59,394
( dialing )

584
00:37:59,395 --> 00:38:01,465
So that's it?

585
00:38:01,466 --> 00:38:04,069
No, we could still sue--

586
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:06,808
hire our own forensics man,
subpoena the shotgun.

587
00:38:06,809 --> 00:38:08,611
Maybe they'd even settle.

588
00:38:08,612 --> 00:38:10,514
But that's just money.

589
00:38:10,515 --> 00:38:11,883
Yeah, just money.

590
00:38:16,426 --> 00:38:18,162
So, uh, you want to
go ahead with this?

591
00:38:18,163 --> 00:38:19,998
Of course I do!

592
00:38:19,999 --> 00:38:22,202
You know I can't do this
for free, Ave.

593
00:38:22,203 --> 00:38:23,772
But I'll try to keep
the cost down.

594
00:38:23,773 --> 00:38:27,045
Thanks, Sam.
I appreciate it.

595
00:38:31,287 --> 00:38:34,258
Oh come on, Barry.
We can't just lay down and let--

596
00:38:36,195 --> 00:38:38,132
Yeah, but we're the only
division that has the freedom

597
00:38:38,133 --> 00:38:41,571
to go after stories like this.
If we give into them now we're just--

598
00:38:41,572 --> 00:38:43,976
( sighs )
Yes, yes.

599
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,653
No no, I understand.

600
00:38:51,792 --> 00:38:53,894
Yeah.

601
00:38:53,895 --> 00:38:56,499
Okay.

602
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,302
<i>That was my editor.</i>

603
00:38:58,303 --> 00:39:01,107
Wants me to cover an apartment
building fire instead.

604
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:04,213
A goddamn fire that nobody
was injured in.

605
00:39:04,214 --> 00:39:06,784
He got ordered off.

606
00:39:06,785 --> 00:39:08,054
Yeah, damn right he did.

607
00:39:10,092 --> 00:39:12,328
It's okay, Carrie.
It's not your fault.

608
00:39:12,329 --> 00:39:14,232
I just can't
walk away from this.

609
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,938
But you have to.

610
00:39:23,216 --> 00:39:25,252
I'm so sorry, Ave.

611
00:39:33,168 --> 00:39:34,735
Okay.

612
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,310
Oh boy.

613
00:39:38,311 --> 00:39:41,416
When I drink
I get so hungry.

614
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:43,184
You know what I could use?

615
00:39:43,185 --> 00:39:45,323
I could use a piece of that
cherry pie right about now.

616
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,662
and speaking
of sweet things,

617
00:39:48,663 --> 00:39:50,432
You know, I think that
waitress was sweet on you.

618
00:39:52,202 --> 00:39:54,238
Who?

619
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:55,507
Gloria?

620
00:39:55,508 --> 00:39:57,678
It's those eyes.

621
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:04,358
And of course now you've
been on television.

622
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:06,662
- You better look out.
- You're crazy.

623
00:40:06,663 --> 00:40:08,999
Maybe you should have
some cherry pie,

624
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,471
soak up some
of that alcohol.

625
00:40:11,472 --> 00:40:13,308
Thank you.

626
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:22,124
<i>You know, Ave,</i>
<i>I'm just so disappointed.</i>

627
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:24,627
I swore that I would
never let--

628
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:30,239
I've been suited for this job
from the very beginning

629
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,109
and I'm good at it.

630
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,844
I know what I want.

631
00:40:40,526 --> 00:40:43,463
What about you, Ave?

632
00:40:43,464 --> 00:40:46,134
What do you want
out of this life?

633
00:40:46,135 --> 00:40:47,905
There must be something.

634
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:56,487
The truth?

635
00:40:58,224 --> 00:41:01,028
The truth about what?

636
00:41:03,901 --> 00:41:05,871
When I lost Mary...

637
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:10,078
all I had left of her was

638
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,884
a house, our store

639
00:41:12,885 --> 00:41:15,087
and Red.

640
00:41:16,624 --> 00:41:18,795
Those boys nearly took
all that away from me

641
00:41:18,796 --> 00:41:20,398
and I...

642
00:41:22,602 --> 00:41:24,738
I just need to make
some sense of it.

643
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:29,481
What if you can't find the
answers that you're looking for?

644
00:41:29,482 --> 00:41:31,451
What if there's no answer?

645
00:41:31,452 --> 00:41:33,355
How do you know when
to stop trying?

646
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:37,963
I learned one thing
during the war:

647
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,171
That you fight with
whatever you've got,

648
00:41:42,172 --> 00:41:44,208
Whatever you can
lay your hands on...

649
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:48,215
and you never stop.

650
00:41:48,216 --> 00:41:50,219
The minute you do,

651
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:53,792
that's the minute the world
rolls right over you.

652
00:42:02,577 --> 00:42:05,547
This is Mary?

653
00:42:05,548 --> 00:42:07,885
She was 53 there.

654
00:42:07,886 --> 00:42:10,556
She was beautiful.

655
00:42:10,557 --> 00:42:13,528
<i>She never thought so.</i>

656
00:42:13,529 --> 00:42:16,300
Carrie:
<i>Well, she was wrong.</i>

657
00:42:16,301 --> 00:42:18,571
<i>She looked so young</i>
<i>for her age.</i>

658
00:42:20,443 --> 00:42:21,810
How old are you, Ave?

659
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:26,419
I ever ask you that?

660
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,922
- <i>No.</i>
- Well, then.

661
00:42:27,923 --> 00:42:30,994
How come you don't have
any pictures of your sons?

662
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,507
I don't have any sons.

663
00:42:38,508 --> 00:42:40,813
Yes you do,
Sam told me.

664
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:45,788
He shouldn't have.

665
00:43:21,255 --> 00:43:24,225
We had Timmy late.

666
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:26,931
I was 48,
Mary was 42.

667
00:43:26,932 --> 00:43:30,738
<i>So it was a kind of surprise</i>
<i>to both of us.</i>

668
00:43:30,739 --> 00:43:34,511
We had to fix up the attic in
order to give him a bedroom.

669
00:43:34,512 --> 00:43:36,781
He was a good boy.

670
00:43:36,782 --> 00:43:39,187
An easy boy.

671
00:43:39,188 --> 00:43:40,189
Favored Mary that way.

672
00:43:42,127 --> 00:43:45,198
<i>But the older boy, Billy,</i>

673
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:48,470
had been different
right from the start.

674
00:43:50,141 --> 00:43:53,078
He always had a way of turning
a good thing sour on himself.

675
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:55,449
He always had
a problem with lying,

676
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:57,688
here at home
and to other people.

677
00:43:59,726 --> 00:44:02,329
He dropped out of school when
they kept him back Junior year.

678
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:06,070
<i>Went to work for Clover's</i>
<i>Hardware here in town.</i>

679
00:44:06,071 --> 00:44:07,873
Got to work late
half the time.

680
00:44:07,874 --> 00:44:09,876
Stayed out nights,
made up lies about why.

681
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:15,520
<i>He always had</i>
<i>this way with him,</i>

682
00:44:15,521 --> 00:44:17,524
<i>Like he couldn't</i>
<i>help himself.</i>

683
00:44:20,029 --> 00:44:21,865
I got this idea in my head

684
00:44:21,866 --> 00:44:24,971
that he might work it out
for himself in the service.

685
00:44:24,972 --> 00:44:28,143
Get some discipline in his life.
It had worked for me.

686
00:44:28,144 --> 00:44:30,748
Maybe he wanted to leave
the house by then anyway,

687
00:44:30,749 --> 00:44:32,552
because it was one of the few
times he listened to me

688
00:44:32,553 --> 00:44:34,655
and did what I told him to.

689
00:44:34,656 --> 00:44:36,859
He joined the Navy.

690
00:44:38,463 --> 00:44:40,433
Nine months later
he was out

691
00:44:40,434 --> 00:44:43,137
on a section 8.

692
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:46,343
- Do you know what that is?
- Mentally unstable.

693
00:44:46,344 --> 00:44:49,215
<i>Unfit is the word</i>
<i>they use.</i>

694
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:55,260
The night it happened...

695
00:44:57,432 --> 00:44:59,434
I was with Emma
down at the store

696
00:44:59,435 --> 00:45:01,371
taking the six-month
inventory.

697
00:45:01,372 --> 00:45:02,974
It was the dead of winter.

698
00:45:02,975 --> 00:45:05,179
Tim was asleep
in the bedroom upstairs,

699
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:07,216
Mary was reading
in the kitchen.

700
00:45:09,387 --> 00:45:11,155
<i>It was about 11:30</i>
<i>by the time</i>

701
00:45:11,156 --> 00:45:13,394
<i>we finished the inventory.</i>

702
00:45:13,395 --> 00:45:16,331
When he told

703
00:45:16,332 --> 00:45:18,469
the story later

704
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:22,377
to the police,
to the detectives,

705
00:45:22,378 --> 00:45:24,713
to the lawyers,
Billy lied.

706
00:45:26,685 --> 00:45:28,688
But it was confused lying.

707
00:45:28,689 --> 00:45:31,794
It was as if he couldn't actually
remember what had happened.

708
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:33,297
He'd lie about one thing

709
00:45:33,298 --> 00:45:35,367
and then tell the truth about
whatever the hell that was

710
00:45:35,368 --> 00:45:38,205
and then go back and lie
about the first thing again.

711
00:45:38,206 --> 00:45:40,243
Or something
completely different.

712
00:45:40,244 --> 00:45:42,346
It just went on that way.

713
00:45:42,347 --> 00:45:45,085
But how we pieced it
together was...

714
00:45:49,828 --> 00:45:52,365
<i>Billy had come around the house</i>
<i>earlier that evening</i>

715
00:45:52,366 --> 00:45:54,102
<i>looking for some money.</i>

716
00:45:54,103 --> 00:45:56,440
<i>Mary told him no.</i>
<i>Told him if he wanted money</i>

717
00:45:56,441 --> 00:45:58,309
<i>he'd have to come down to</i>
<i>the store and talk to me.</i>

718
00:46:00,147 --> 00:46:03,185
<i>Well, he knew he wasn't</i>
<i>going to do that.</i>

719
00:46:05,056 --> 00:46:07,225
<i>I'd had it by then.</i>

720
00:46:07,226 --> 00:46:10,198
<i>So they argued</i>
<i>and eventually he left.</i>

721
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:12,803
<i>Then just before 11:00</i>

722
00:46:12,804 --> 00:46:16,109
<i>He came back to the house
again still looking for money.</i>

723
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:18,279
<i>And Mary still told</i>
<i>him no again.</i>

724
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,656
I don't know why,
but he...

725
00:46:23,657 --> 00:46:26,461
locked Red here,

726
00:46:26,462 --> 00:46:28,666
up here in the bedroom.

727
00:46:28,667 --> 00:46:31,637
Maybe he was barking,
I don't know.

728
00:46:33,074 --> 00:46:35,478
Then he went back out
to the kitchen

729
00:46:35,479 --> 00:46:37,849
and started hitting her.

730
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:39,686
Beating her.

731
00:46:42,525 --> 00:46:44,227
Maybe he thought he'd get
money from her that way.

732
00:46:44,228 --> 00:46:46,065
Maybe it was just one
of his crazy rages.

733
00:46:46,066 --> 00:46:48,335
But he hurt her.

734
00:46:48,336 --> 00:46:50,806
He hurt her so bad

735
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:53,712
I guess he thought
he'd killed her.

736
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:03,630
Because then he decided--

737
00:47:03,631 --> 00:47:07,203
he decided he'd have to
cover up what he did.

738
00:47:09,709 --> 00:47:12,380
So he went out
to the tool shed

739
00:47:12,381 --> 00:47:15,986
and got the can of kerosene
I used to keep out there...

740
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:21,130
went up to the attic bedroom
and threw it all over Tim.

741
00:47:22,665 --> 00:47:24,735
All over my son

742
00:47:24,736 --> 00:47:27,408
who was lying asleep.

743
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,382
He burned him to death...

744
00:47:34,187 --> 00:47:36,057
up there in his room.

745
00:47:38,762 --> 00:47:41,533
But kerosene doesn't burn
as hot as gasoline.

746
00:47:43,304 --> 00:47:44,872
I mean,
he killed Tim all right,

747
00:47:44,873 --> 00:47:46,675
the boy was saturated
with the stuff.

748
00:47:46,676 --> 00:47:49,648
But all that burned
up there was my son

749
00:47:49,649 --> 00:47:51,218
and the mattress he lay on.

750
00:47:53,824 --> 00:47:56,026
Not even the drapes
caught fire.

751
00:47:58,866 --> 00:48:00,969
He...

752
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:03,539
closed the bedroom door,

753
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:06,378
locked it behind him,

754
00:48:06,379 --> 00:48:09,885
stood outside and waited

755
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:11,788
till my son
stopped screaming.

756
00:48:13,226 --> 00:48:15,729
Until it was quiet.

757
00:48:17,133 --> 00:48:20,003
Then he came back down
and threw the kerosene over Mary

758
00:48:20,004 --> 00:48:23,109
lying on the kitchen floor, lit
another match and threw that on her.

759
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:25,380
Then got into his car
and drove away.

760
00:48:28,019 --> 00:48:29,789
But she...

761
00:48:33,329 --> 00:48:35,867
my wife

762
00:48:35,868 --> 00:48:37,469
wasn't dead.

763
00:48:40,176 --> 00:48:42,179
Oh, he'd hurt her,

764
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:44,715
but he hadn't killed her.

765
00:48:44,716 --> 00:48:46,786
She was still alive.

766
00:48:49,125 --> 00:48:51,128
He'd got it wrong.

767
00:48:51,129 --> 00:48:53,364
Wrong about that just like
he was wrong

768
00:48:53,365 --> 00:48:55,670
about the kerosene
burning the house down.

769
00:48:55,671 --> 00:48:58,341
He was wrong about
everything always.

770
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:02,715
It was all for nothing.

771
00:49:08,294 --> 00:49:10,497
I guess the pain woke her.

772
00:49:13,637 --> 00:49:15,740
<i>She managed to get</i>
<i>herself outside</i>

773
00:49:15,741 --> 00:49:17,910
<i>And roll across the ground</i>
<i>on the dirt and the grass</i>

774
00:49:17,911 --> 00:49:20,181
<i>until the flames were out.</i>

775
00:49:20,182 --> 00:49:23,120
<i>Then she still had</i>
<i>enough left in her</i>

776
00:49:23,121 --> 00:49:26,026
to crawl back into the house
and dial 911.

777
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:33,640
<i>They found her on the stairs</i>
<i>halfway up to Tim's bedroom.</i>

778
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:42,255
She lived
for another five days.

779
00:49:42,256 --> 00:49:44,593
Never did come out
of the coma.

780
00:49:45,796 --> 00:49:47,499
I think that was
a blessing.

781
00:49:50,038 --> 00:49:51,806
Her burns were so bad

782
00:49:51,807 --> 00:49:53,609
they wouldn't let me
hold her.

783
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:56,582
In the end

784
00:49:56,583 --> 00:49:59,087
I did anyway.

785
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:13,179
<i>( dog barking )</i>

786
00:50:18,322 --> 00:50:20,359
Thank you.

787
00:50:28,441 --> 00:50:30,545
<i>( car starts )</i>

788
00:50:45,774 --> 00:50:49,112
- Danny: Pete!
- Pete: I'm leaving right now.

789
00:50:49,113 --> 00:50:51,015
I don't care.

790
00:50:51,016 --> 00:50:53,286
- No!
- Leave a little bit!

791
00:50:53,287 --> 00:50:55,824
Pete:
<i>I didn't fucking take it!</i>

792
00:50:55,825 --> 00:50:57,428
Don't you lie.

793
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,631
Go back in the house,
you crazy bitch.

794
00:50:59,632 --> 00:51:01,602
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me?

795
00:51:01,603 --> 00:51:03,037
( spits )

796
00:51:04,809 --> 00:51:06,944
Fuck you!

797
00:51:13,993 --> 00:51:15,226
<i>( engine starts )</i>

798
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:30,455
That is disgusting, man.

799
00:52:02,549 --> 00:52:06,020
<i>( girl giggling )</i>

800
00:52:06,021 --> 00:52:09,660
You're touching me but
you're not looking at me.

801
00:52:09,661 --> 00:52:11,898
<i>Ow!</i>

802
00:52:11,899 --> 00:52:15,170
- I'm going.
- Are you going?

803
00:52:15,171 --> 00:52:17,007
- I want to go home.
- Danny: <i>I had a nice time.</i>

804
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,777
- <i>( Danny laughing )</i>
- I'll tell you in the car.

805
00:52:18,778 --> 00:52:22,284
He's such a dick.
I hate him.

806
00:52:22,285 --> 00:52:25,890
<i>( Pete laughing )</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>

807
00:52:25,891 --> 00:52:27,761
Danny:
<i>I don't know.</i>

808
00:52:27,762 --> 00:52:30,031
She's the most irritating
girl I've ever met.

809
00:52:30,032 --> 00:52:32,268
( laughing )

810
00:52:55,111 --> 00:52:57,247
I saw you parked here.

811
00:52:58,585 --> 00:53:00,187
Danny didn't.

812
00:53:01,725 --> 00:53:03,392
Where is he?

813
00:53:03,393 --> 00:53:05,596
He's down the street
at Bowman's Auto.

814
00:53:05,597 --> 00:53:07,667
Does he know you're here?

815
00:53:07,668 --> 00:53:09,471
No.

816
00:53:11,209 --> 00:53:14,246
No, I told him
I needed cigarettes.

817
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:19,423
You know, he'd be pretty damn mad
if he knew I was talking to you.

818
00:53:19,424 --> 00:53:21,926
- Would he?
- Yeah.

819
00:53:21,927 --> 00:53:25,133
You and him argue a lot,
your brother?

820
00:53:25,134 --> 00:53:27,337
Look, Mr. Ludlow,

821
00:53:27,338 --> 00:53:29,941
I'm not gonna pretend that
things are all buddy-buddy

822
00:53:29,942 --> 00:53:32,279
between Danny and me.
That's not why I'm here.

823
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,782
That's not my point.

824
00:53:33,783 --> 00:53:35,886
What is your point then?

825
00:53:38,825 --> 00:53:40,695
That, um...

826
00:53:41,898 --> 00:53:44,536
That I just wanted
to say sorry.

827
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:49,143
You know, for what we did.

828
00:53:49,144 --> 00:53:51,214
About your dog.
That's why I'm here.

829
00:53:51,215 --> 00:53:52,818
I'm here to say that.

830
00:53:54,554 --> 00:53:56,256
I'm glad to hear it.

831
00:53:58,495 --> 00:54:00,732
Though the one I need
to hear it from most

832
00:54:00,733 --> 00:54:02,936
is your brother.

833
00:54:02,937 --> 00:54:05,574
I'm still glad to hear
it from you though.

834
00:54:07,312 --> 00:54:09,582
Question is, what now?

835
00:54:11,619 --> 00:54:13,087
What do you--
what do you--

836
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,730
Are you gonna keep on
lying for him?

837
00:54:17,731 --> 00:54:20,769
God, I mean what do you
expect me to do?

838
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:23,808
I mean, first you come and you
ask me in front of my father.

839
00:54:23,809 --> 00:54:25,979
Then you go
and you get it on T.V.

840
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,984
I expect you
to tell the truth.

841
00:54:28,985 --> 00:54:30,753
I expect you
to tell your father.

842
00:54:30,754 --> 00:54:33,259
I expect you to tell the
Police if it comes to that.

843
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:35,094
You don't get it.

844
00:54:35,095 --> 00:54:38,301
You don't understand.
That's just not gonna happen.

845
00:54:38,302 --> 00:54:40,672
Suppose you
make me understand.

846
00:54:42,309 --> 00:54:44,211
Look, I gotta go,
all right?

847
00:54:44,212 --> 00:54:45,514
If Danny sees me here--

848
00:54:48,253 --> 00:54:50,356
Who are you
afraid of, Harold?

849
00:54:50,357 --> 00:54:54,030
Your brother?
Your father?

850
00:54:56,769 --> 00:54:59,740
You were man enough to come down
here and say what you just said to me.

851
00:54:59,741 --> 00:55:02,312
I figure that already
makes you a bigger man

852
00:55:02,313 --> 00:55:04,349
than your brother

853
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:06,052
and maybe even
your father.

854
00:55:09,426 --> 00:55:11,128
I don't think
you've got all that much

855
00:55:11,129 --> 00:55:13,098
to worry about
from either of them.

856
00:55:13,099 --> 00:55:14,735
Do you?

857
00:55:17,708 --> 00:55:20,111
Believe me, Mr. Ludlow,
you don't have a clue.

858
00:55:45,659 --> 00:55:47,662
Mr. McCormack:
<i>Hon, what is it?</i>

859
00:55:47,663 --> 00:55:50,133
I was going to vacuum.

860
00:55:50,134 --> 00:55:52,571
And?

861
00:55:55,578 --> 00:55:57,614
<i>So I hear</i>
<i>you're suing me.</i>

862
00:55:57,615 --> 00:55:59,917
- I'd rather not.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

863
00:55:59,918 --> 00:56:02,088
I don't know why
you bother.

864
00:56:02,089 --> 00:56:04,460
It's not gonna be worth either
your time or your money.

865
00:56:06,331 --> 00:56:09,803
I'm wondering if you're proud
of Daniel, Mr. McCormack.

866
00:56:09,804 --> 00:56:13,243
<i>Because if not,</i>

867
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,412
then there's gonna be trouble
between you and the boy.

868
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:19,220
<i>And that's something you may</i>
<i>care to do something about</i>

869
00:56:19,221 --> 00:56:21,658
<i>while you still have time,</i>

870
00:56:21,659 --> 00:56:23,995
<i>instead of using your money</i>
<i>to cover up for him.</i>

871
00:56:23,996 --> 00:56:26,199
You know, I don't need
any lectures from you.

872
00:56:31,511 --> 00:56:34,080
<i>My boys are my boys.</i>

873
00:56:34,081 --> 00:56:37,020
And I'll handle them any way
I see fit, okay?

874
00:56:39,091 --> 00:56:41,160
If you're gonna sue me,
just go ahead and do it.

875
00:56:41,161 --> 00:56:43,431
It'll cause me
some embarrassment

876
00:56:43,432 --> 00:56:46,504
in some places,

877
00:56:46,505 --> 00:56:48,740
but it won't
hurt me very--

878
00:56:48,741 --> 00:56:49,876
very much.

879
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:54,986
So do it.

880
00:56:54,987 --> 00:56:57,924
And if you could win, what
are you gonna get out of it?

881
00:56:57,925 --> 00:57:00,597
<i>The value of a dog?</i>

882
00:57:00,598 --> 00:57:03,034
A goddamn dog from
a goddamn dog pound?

883
00:57:03,035 --> 00:57:04,403
Huh?

884
00:57:07,243 --> 00:57:10,147
<i>Huh?</i>

885
00:57:10,148 --> 00:57:12,352
Really I could
care less either way.

886
00:57:12,353 --> 00:57:14,922
Do you understand?
Do you understand, Ave?

887
00:57:14,923 --> 00:57:17,327
Mm-hmm.

888
00:57:17,328 --> 00:57:19,163
I guess I do.

889
00:57:19,165 --> 00:57:20,800
<i>You guess you do?</i>
<i>Good.</i>

890
00:57:20,801 --> 00:57:22,168
<i>Do not come back here.</i>

891
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:27,379
<i>And do not go</i>
<i>snooping around</i>

892
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:30,150
<i>my boys anymore.</i>

893
00:57:30,151 --> 00:57:32,722
<i>or I'll have the Sheriff</i>

894
00:57:32,723 --> 00:57:35,627
<i>up your ass before</i>
<i>you know what hit you.</i>

895
00:57:35,628 --> 00:57:37,197
<i>Okay?</i>

896
00:57:41,706 --> 00:57:43,609
<i>( bat cracking )</i>

897
00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:45,680
Pete:
<i>I got it, I got it!</i>

898
00:57:45,681 --> 00:57:47,282
Shit!

899
00:57:53,495 --> 00:57:56,031
<i>Come on, you guys.</i>
<i>Let's kick some ass.</i>

900
00:57:58,403 --> 00:58:02,010
Here we go. Batter
batter batter. Swing!

901
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:05,349
- Good eye, Danny.
- Why don't you pitch over the plate?

902
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:07,820
<i>Come on, Danny, you're
playing like my grandmother.</i>

903
00:58:07,821 --> 00:58:10,392
- Come on!
- <i>Listen, it's all good.</i>

904
00:58:10,393 --> 00:58:12,362
<i>Hit the next one.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

905
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:15,635
- <i>Outside.</i>
- Bitch!

906
00:58:15,636 --> 00:58:17,872
Pete:
<i>Hey, take it easy, Danny.</i>

907
00:58:17,873 --> 00:58:21,111
- <i>Danny, it's okay, man.</i>
- Danny: <i>What was that, huh?</i>

908
00:58:21,112 --> 00:58:23,950
Pete: <i>Yo, Danny. Danny, we
got a game going on here, man.</i>

909
00:58:23,951 --> 00:58:26,321
<i>We have two outs.</i>
<i>Danny, hey!</i>

910
00:58:26,322 --> 00:58:29,326
- <i>Danny, please, man.</i>
- Harold: <i>Danny!</i>

911
00:58:29,327 --> 00:58:31,898
Shut the fuck up, Harold.
Get in the car

912
00:58:31,899 --> 00:58:33,668
or you're walking
your ass home.

913
00:58:33,669 --> 00:58:36,140
- Pete: <i>Danny, come on.</i>
- Fuck! Fuck!

914
00:58:36,141 --> 00:58:39,679
<i>Calm down, man.</i>
<i>What are you doing? Danny!</i>

915
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,849
- <i>We'll see you guys later.</i>
- Harold: <i>Sorry.</i>

916
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:43,787
Pete:
<i>Danny, wait up.</i>

917
00:58:43,788 --> 00:58:45,656
Danny, come on, man.

918
00:58:47,093 --> 00:58:49,764
Harold: <i>Danny, could you wait?
Danny, wait!</i>

919
00:58:49,765 --> 00:58:52,737
- <i>( engine sputtering )</i>
- Fuck!

920
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:54,873
Just get in the car.
Danny, wait.

921
00:58:54,874 --> 00:58:57,980
<i>( engine revving )</i>

922
00:58:59,617 --> 00:59:01,086
Real nice.

923
00:59:13,643 --> 00:59:16,113
Catch a fucking ball, huh?

924
00:59:16,114 --> 00:59:18,416
Leave me to do
all the fucking work.

925
00:59:22,993 --> 00:59:25,463
<i>( baby crying )</i>

926
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,237
<i>Hey.</i>

927
00:59:29,238 --> 00:59:31,041
It's the goddamn
old man again.

928
00:59:31,042 --> 00:59:32,977
You've been following us,
haven't you?

929
00:59:32,978 --> 00:59:35,315
Why would I want
to do that?

930
00:59:35,316 --> 00:59:36,850
I've seen your truck.

931
00:59:36,851 --> 00:59:40,425
It's a small town.
I suppose you would now and then.

932
00:59:40,426 --> 00:59:41,827
Saw you in Jenny Lind.

933
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:44,765
That's possible too.

934
00:59:47,271 --> 00:59:48,873
Cut it out.

935
00:59:55,052 --> 00:59:56,287
Cut it out?

936
00:59:56,288 --> 00:59:58,458
You know what
I'm talking about.

937
00:59:58,459 --> 01:00:00,928
I'm telling you right now,
cut it out.

938
01:00:00,929 --> 01:00:02,865
Are you threatening
me, son?

939
01:00:02,866 --> 01:00:04,769
I'm telling you.

940
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:07,441
I wouldn't be threatening
anyone if I were you.

941
01:00:07,442 --> 01:00:10,045
Not unless you can fight
a whole lot better

942
01:00:10,046 --> 01:00:12,416
than you can swing
those things.

943
01:00:12,417 --> 01:00:14,553
You stupid son of a bitch.

944
01:00:14,554 --> 01:00:16,290
What are you doing
following us around, huh?

945
01:00:16,291 --> 01:00:18,527
Spying on us?
Who the hell do you--

946
01:00:18,528 --> 01:00:19,897
No, Danny! Danny, chill! Danny!

947
01:00:19,898 --> 01:00:21,633
- Just chill.
- All right.

948
01:00:21,634 --> 01:00:22,702
- Chill.
- Fuck this jerk.

949
01:00:26,276 --> 01:00:28,646
You got a nice swing, Pete.

950
01:00:28,647 --> 01:00:30,550
Good eye too.

951
01:00:32,287 --> 01:00:34,256
Not like
Miss McCormack here.

952
01:00:34,257 --> 01:00:37,062
You stupid fuck.
Come here.

953
01:00:37,063 --> 01:00:38,965
Don't walk away from me.

954
01:00:38,966 --> 01:00:41,170
I'll leave your fucking
dentures on the sidewalk.

955
01:00:43,441 --> 01:00:46,245
( groans, gasps )

956
01:00:49,886 --> 01:00:51,955
You've just been
suckered, boy.

957
01:00:51,956 --> 01:00:54,194
I got witnesses
all over the street

958
01:00:54,195 --> 01:00:56,465
Who saw you come at me
first with a weapon.

959
01:00:56,466 --> 01:00:58,434
Some of them
are old friends of mine.

960
01:00:58,435 --> 01:01:00,505
So don't you try
and make a fuss of this.

961
01:01:00,506 --> 01:01:03,410
I just gave you what your father
should've given you and wouldn't.

962
01:01:03,411 --> 01:01:06,082
But you damn well had to have
that one way or another.

963
01:01:06,083 --> 01:01:08,687
It won't bring my dog back,

964
01:01:08,688 --> 01:01:10,656
but maybe you'll think twice.

965
01:01:10,657 --> 01:01:13,529
And maybe you'll think of me and Red
before you let that mean streak out again.

966
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:16,567
( coughing )

967
01:01:27,389 --> 01:01:30,160
- ( gasping )
- You all right?

968
01:01:30,161 --> 01:01:32,864
Don't even worry about it.

969
01:01:36,338 --> 01:01:38,776
<i>( horn honks )</i>

970
01:01:57,110 --> 01:01:58,444
On the house, Ave.

971
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:06,759
<i>( rock music playing )</i>

972
01:02:17,181 --> 01:02:18,649
Bartender:
<i>Last one's on me, Ave.</i>

973
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:22,321
Call it a contribution.
Good night, jack.

974
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:24,794
( phone ringing )

975
01:02:28,168 --> 01:02:29,770
Joe's.

976
01:02:29,771 --> 01:02:31,305
Yeah, he's here.
He's just leaving.

977
01:02:31,306 --> 01:02:33,576
<i>Ave!</i>

978
01:02:35,214 --> 01:02:36,849
<i>What?</i>

979
01:02:42,427 --> 01:02:43,962
I'll tell him.

980
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:52,010
<i>( fire roaring )</i>

981
01:02:53,347 --> 01:02:55,282
<i>( sirens blaring )</i>

982

( groaning )

983
01:03:14,353 --> 01:03:15,988
Cup of joe?

984
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:20,428
Hmm?

985
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:22,199
- Doughnut?
- No thank you.

986
01:03:24,672 --> 01:03:26,574
Somebody torched it,
all right.

987
01:03:26,575 --> 01:03:28,544
Didn't even try
to cover it up.

988
01:03:28,545 --> 01:03:30,581
Have them run it
for prints.

989
01:03:30,582 --> 01:03:32,118
Weren't any on the rock.

990
01:03:32,119 --> 01:03:34,222
Ave, I'm sorry.

991
01:03:37,628 --> 01:03:40,466
Ave. I want you
to leave town, Ave.

992
01:03:40,467 --> 01:03:42,069
Go on up to the lake,

993
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:44,474
have a couple of
quiet days fishing.

994
01:03:44,475 --> 01:03:46,978
Heck, I might
even join you.

995
01:03:53,892 --> 01:03:56,897
We both know who did this.
Everybody knows.

996
01:03:56,898 --> 01:03:58,700
We've been out on this
all night, Ave.

997
01:03:58,701 --> 01:04:00,604
Nobody saw anything.

998
01:04:00,605 --> 01:04:03,308
You don't always need
to see the truth to know it.

999
01:04:03,309 --> 01:04:05,312
Listen, Ave,
they weren't even in town.

1000
01:04:05,313 --> 01:04:08,117
The Sheriff checked.
They were all out at their house

1001
01:04:08,118 --> 01:04:11,891
up at St. Elizabeth throwing
a big 17th birthday party

1002
01:04:11,892 --> 01:04:13,694
for their boy Harold.

1003
01:04:13,695 --> 01:04:16,867
Couple of dozen witnesses,
every one of them reliable.

1004
01:04:16,868 --> 01:04:19,037
nobody left there
all night long.

1005
01:04:19,038 --> 01:04:19,906
Pete Doust too?

1006
01:04:22,678 --> 01:04:24,014
<i>( hammering )</i>

1007
01:04:25,517 --> 01:04:26,985
<i>You again.</i>

1008
01:04:26,986 --> 01:04:28,922
Mr. Ludlow's here, Hon.

1009
01:04:31,361 --> 01:04:34,500
Is Peter around,
Mr. Doust?

1010
01:04:34,501 --> 01:04:38,039
Uh, no. He's up
to St. Elizabeth.

1011
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,943
Why?

1012
01:04:39,944 --> 01:04:43,115
Went up for the party
last night, did he?

1013
01:04:43,116 --> 01:04:44,818
For the party, yeah.

1014
01:04:44,819 --> 01:04:46,956
Why?

1015
01:04:46,957 --> 01:04:50,362
Well, I guess
you all didn't hear.

1016
01:04:50,363 --> 01:04:53,534
My store burned down
last night.

1017
01:04:53,535 --> 01:04:56,540
<i>Somebody set fire to it.</i>

1018
01:04:58,411 --> 01:05:00,614
I hope you're not saying
what I think you're saying.

1019
01:05:00,615 --> 01:05:03,620
'Cause Pete was up there,
you know, with the McCormacks

1020
01:05:03,621 --> 01:05:05,991
<i>all night long with dozens</i>
<i>of other people.</i>

1021
01:05:05,992 --> 01:05:08,295
So he had nothing to do
with that fire.

1022
01:05:12,436 --> 01:05:15,174
I see you all have been making
a few home improvements.

1023
01:05:15,175 --> 01:05:17,444
Oh, yeah.

1024
01:05:17,445 --> 01:05:19,950
Yeah, about time,
you know?

1025
01:05:19,951 --> 01:05:22,421
Yeah, about time.

1026
01:05:22,422 --> 01:05:23,456
Sure, I know.

1027
01:05:25,494 --> 01:05:27,730
<i>I was wondering,</i>

1028
01:05:27,731 --> 01:05:30,603
Good help like this
doesn't come cheap.

1029
01:05:30,604 --> 01:05:32,707
And what I heard was

1030
01:05:32,708 --> 01:05:34,610
<i>you're out of work</i>
<i>these days.</i>

1031
01:05:37,049 --> 01:05:39,419
Fuck you, Ludlow.

1032
01:06:43,638 --> 01:06:46,008
<i>They're not gonna use</i>
<i>this story either, are they?</i>

1033
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:51,385
<i>No, they're not.</i>

1034
01:06:51,386 --> 01:06:54,123
Nobody died, am I right?

1035
01:06:54,124 --> 01:06:55,893
<i>That's right.</i>

1036
01:06:55,894 --> 01:06:56,994
<i>Nobody died.</i>

1037
01:07:02,306 --> 01:07:04,810
I wanted to go to
the McCormack house today...

1038
01:07:06,513 --> 01:07:09,986
get the father on camera
saying, "no comment,"

1039
01:07:09,987 --> 01:07:12,491
show everyone
what he's like--

1040
01:07:12,492 --> 01:07:14,360
that nothing
means nothing to him.

1041
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:19,570
<i>I pushed them, Ave.</i>

1042
01:07:19,571 --> 01:07:21,741
I wouldn't let off it.

1043
01:07:21,742 --> 01:07:23,511
I didn't think--

1044
01:07:26,651 --> 01:07:30,157
They transferred me
to another affiliate--

1045
01:07:32,528 --> 01:07:34,431
In Boise.

1046
01:07:37,204 --> 01:07:39,273
I lost, Ave.

1047
01:07:42,045 --> 01:07:43,214
And I let you down.

1048
01:07:56,973 --> 01:07:58,876
<i>( truck starts )</i>

1049
01:08:34,709 --> 01:08:36,712
<i>( crows cawing )</i>

1050
01:08:52,977 --> 01:08:54,778
Oh my God.

1051
01:08:58,753 --> 01:09:01,758
I need to speak
with your husband, ma'am.

1052
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:04,062
Oh my God.

1053
01:09:04,063 --> 01:09:05,866
I'm sorry.

1054
01:09:05,867 --> 01:09:08,237
It's your husband who needs
to see this, ma'am, not you.

1055
01:09:10,509 --> 01:09:12,277
Why are you
doing this to us?

1056
01:09:13,848 --> 01:09:15,718
I don't mean
any disrespect,

1057
01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:17,889
but I'm afraid you've got
that wrong, ma'am,

1058
01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:21,227
about who's done
what to who.

1059
01:09:21,228 --> 01:09:24,534
Can't you please
just leave us alone?

1060
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:27,105
Where is he,
Mrs. McCormack?

1061
01:09:27,106 --> 01:09:29,342
Right here.

1062
01:09:35,521 --> 01:09:38,025
Goddamn lunatic
coming here.

1063
01:09:38,026 --> 01:09:41,097
Sometimes the only way
to know a thing, Mr. McCormack,

1064
01:09:41,098 --> 01:09:43,202
is to know it first hand.

1065
01:09:43,203 --> 01:09:45,906
- You're trespassing.
- <i>See it,</i>

1066
01:09:45,907 --> 01:09:48,979
taste it,
touch it.

1067
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:50,782
And then you'll know it.

1068
01:09:52,352 --> 01:09:54,388
Somebody burned my store
down last night.

1069
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:57,595
<i>A few nights back,</i>

1070
01:09:57,596 --> 01:10:00,466
somebody threw a rock
through my window.

1071
01:10:00,467 --> 01:10:03,505
But I'm not here
about any of that.

1072
01:10:05,409 --> 01:10:07,179
I'm here...

1073
01:10:12,155 --> 01:10:14,325
about this.

1074
01:10:19,168 --> 01:10:21,739
Get that goddamn thing
out of here.

1075
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:23,709
Now, Ludlow!

1076
01:10:23,710 --> 01:10:25,512
In a minute

1077
01:10:25,513 --> 01:10:28,485
when you tell me what
you're gonna do about it.

1078
01:10:28,486 --> 01:10:30,956
I'm not gonna do
shit about it.

1079
01:10:30,957 --> 01:10:33,327
You stupid old fuck!
You just don't fucking listen.

1080
01:10:33,328 --> 01:10:35,330
- No, Danny, don't!
- ( gunshot )

1081
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:37,835
( all shouting )

1082
01:10:37,836 --> 01:10:41,075
Dad!

1083
01:10:41,076 --> 01:10:43,545
Let my boy go!
God damn it, let him go!

1084
01:10:43,546 --> 01:10:46,017
Put it down.
Put it down.

1085
01:10:48,456 --> 01:10:50,426
That's simple.
Put it down.

1086
01:10:54,132 --> 01:10:56,470
- Okay...
- ( sobs )

1087
01:10:56,471 --> 01:10:59,442
...Now we're
gonna get up

1088
01:10:59,443 --> 01:11:02,380
- real slowly.
- It's okay, Danny.

1089
01:11:02,381 --> 01:11:04,117
Knees first.

1090
01:11:05,955 --> 01:11:08,591
<i>Then all the way.</i>

1091
01:11:08,592 --> 01:11:12,232
Ma'am, I'd be
obliged

1092
01:11:12,233 --> 01:11:14,203
If you'd throw me that
hand towel you have there.

1093
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,389
Much obliged.

1094
01:11:25,390 --> 01:11:27,393
<i>( Danny grunts )</i>

1095
01:11:31,001 --> 01:11:33,170
I'm taking him into town.

1096
01:11:33,171 --> 01:11:35,107
Trespassing's one thing,

1097
01:11:35,108 --> 01:11:37,345
and I guess
I'm guilty there,

1098
01:11:37,346 --> 01:11:39,282
but weapon
assault's another.

1099
01:11:42,155 --> 01:11:44,124
And I never knew anyone

1100
01:11:44,125 --> 01:11:46,162
who'd shoot a suspected
intruder in the ear

1101
01:11:46,163 --> 01:11:48,800
at point-blank range
in broad daylight.

1102
01:11:48,801 --> 01:11:50,869
And I don't think
the police will either.

1103
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:55,178
And who knows,
Mr. McCormack?

1104
01:11:55,179 --> 01:11:58,083
We might make the
papers this time. Huh?

1105
01:12:00,288 --> 01:12:01,857
<i>I'd appreciate it</i>
<i>very much</i>

1106
01:12:01,858 --> 01:12:04,362
if you'd cover up my dog
for me again, ma'am.

1107
01:12:04,363 --> 01:12:05,763
I'll be back for him.

1108
01:12:05,764 --> 01:12:08,235
Danny, it's okay.

1109
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:17,919
You're driving.

1110
01:12:33,149 --> 01:12:34,350
( winces )

1111
01:12:37,791 --> 01:12:41,229
Go on.
Go easy.

1112
01:12:41,230 --> 01:12:43,032
It's a damn bumpy road.

1113
01:12:43,033 --> 01:12:44,301
You're fucking crazy.

1114
01:12:46,006 --> 01:12:49,477
In that case, you better do
as I tell you, hadn't you?

1115
01:12:52,517 --> 01:12:54,855
( engine starts )

1116
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:14,791
Would it help if I said
I was sorry about the dog?

1117
01:13:17,397 --> 01:13:20,568
I think you're a tad late
with your apology, son.

1118
01:13:27,282 --> 01:13:29,317
( tires squealing )

1119
01:13:34,094 --> 01:13:35,463
Oh, shit!

1120
01:13:36,866 --> 01:13:38,601
Danny:
<i>He's not gonna stop.</i>

1121
01:13:38,602 --> 01:13:40,906
I'm telling you,
we got to stop the truck.

1122
01:13:40,907 --> 01:13:43,110
I know him, okay?
He's not gonna stop.

1123
01:13:43,111 --> 01:13:44,647
Just keep on driving.

<i>( crashes )</i>

1125
01:14:10,261 --> 01:14:12,530
You hit him just like
we said, son.

1126
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:14,835
Okay?

1127
01:14:24,254 --> 01:14:25,755

My god, what the hell
are you doing here?

What?

1146
01:16:31,756 --> 01:16:33,824
I left him here
up on the porch.

<i>They will fucking</i>
<i>kill you.</i>

1148

Jesus Christ, they think they
already fucking killed you.

I only want my dog,
that's all.

1150

<i>It's around the back.</i>

1152
01:16:48,085 --> 01:16:50,221
They threw your dog
in the woods.

1153
01:16:50,222 --> 01:16:52,024
Why?

1154
01:16:53,829 --> 01:16:55,564
Because it's evidence.

1155
01:16:55,565 --> 01:16:58,837
Mr. Ludlow, it is fucking
evidence of what they did to you.

1156
01:16:58,838 --> 01:17:00,673
Take me there.

Look at you,
you're fucking hurt.

1158
01:17:02,578 --> 01:17:04,081
You don't know what
you're talking about.

1159
01:17:04,082 --> 01:17:06,284

01:21:04,524 --> 01:21:06,527
You had yourself
quite a day.

1225
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:09,465
Quite a day.

1226
01:21:33,677 --> 01:21:35,480
<i>( digging )</i>

1227
01:22:23,202 --> 01:22:25,338
( sighs )

1228
01:23:43,785 --> 01:23:46,287
<i>( car door opens, closes )</i>

1229
01:23:46,288 --> 01:23:48,258
Today's the day, huh?

1230
01:23:50,363 --> 01:23:54,303
Be sure to drop me a line
when you get to Boise

1231
01:23:54,304 --> 01:23:56,072
so I know how to find you.

1232
01:23:57,443 --> 01:23:59,746
Carrie:
<i>I'm not going to Boise, Ave.</i>

1233
01:24:01,317 --> 01:24:03,519
The editor from
a New York paper called.

1234
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:04,989
<i>He read the article.</i>

1235
01:24:04,990 --> 01:24:07,426
Said it was the best
human interest story

1236
01:24:07,427 --> 01:24:09,698
he'd read in a decade.
That he wanted more

1237
01:24:09,699 --> 01:24:12,068
<i>so he offered me</i>
<i>a staff job.</i>

1238
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:16,277
They even said they'd pay
for the lawyers

1239
01:24:16,278 --> 01:24:17,712
if McCormack follows through
on his lawsuit.

1240
01:24:20,285 --> 01:24:22,020
<i>Good for you.</i>

1241
01:24:26,830 --> 01:24:29,367
Jesus, Ave. How long
you gonna make me wait?

1242
01:24:29,368 --> 01:24:31,905
Wait?
What for?

1243
01:24:31,906 --> 01:24:34,376
The article.
What did you think?

1244
01:24:34,377 --> 01:24:36,814
Well, it was

1245
01:24:36,815 --> 01:24:38,785
certainly well written.

1246
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:43,627
- But?
- But...

1247
01:24:43,628 --> 01:24:44,861
it wasn't true.

1248
01:24:48,904 --> 01:24:50,306
I don't understand you.

1249
01:24:50,307 --> 01:24:52,577
Carrie,

1250
01:24:52,578 --> 01:24:55,315
two boys died.

1251
01:24:55,316 --> 01:24:57,920
It was self defense, Ave.

1252
01:24:57,921 --> 01:25:00,826
I just couldn't let it go.

1253
01:25:02,763 --> 01:25:04,733
I couldn't.

1254
01:25:06,069 --> 01:25:08,106
Like it or not.

1255
01:25:17,224 --> 01:25:18,891
What?

1256
01:25:20,963 --> 01:25:23,166
<i>What?</i>

1257
01:25:29,746 --> 01:25:31,749
Emma gave her to me.

1258
01:25:33,988 --> 01:25:36,090
Evangeline had herself
a litter of four.

1259
01:25:36,091 --> 01:25:37,994
Ah.

1260
01:25:37,995 --> 01:25:40,598
Two of them black
and two of them red.

1261
01:25:46,477 --> 01:25:48,647
Oh no, Carrie.
I don't think I can--

1262
01:25:48,648 --> 01:25:50,484
What do you mean?
You don't think you can what?

1263
01:25:50,485 --> 01:25:52,587
Carrie, I'm old.

1264
01:25:52,588 --> 01:25:54,156
I-- she's just--

1265
01:25:54,157 --> 01:25:56,461
Don't think
of things that way

1266
01:25:56,462 --> 01:25:58,565
or else there's nothing
in life that you can have

1267
01:25:58,566 --> 01:26:00,034
that's anywhere
near worth having.

1268
01:26:00,035 --> 01:26:02,138
I can't do this.

1269
01:26:02,139 --> 01:26:03,273
I--

1270
01:26:05,479 --> 01:26:06,880
You give her
what time you can.

1271
01:26:08,984 --> 01:26:10,353
She'll do the same.

1272
01:26:10,354 --> 01:26:11,956
Carrie, take the dog.

1273
01:26:11,957 --> 01:26:13,860
You'll both do just fine.

1274
01:26:13,861 --> 01:26:16,064
<i>Carrie, take the dog.</i>

1275
01:26:16,065 --> 01:26:18,468
Take the dog, Carrie!

1276
01:26:21,742 --> 01:26:23,679
Carrie.
Carrie!

1277
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:25,280
The dog!

1278
01:26:25,281 --> 01:26:26,950
<i>( starts engine )</i>

1279
01:27:03,152 --> 01:27:05,054
<i>( paws pattering )</i>

1280
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:14,972
( whines )

1281
01:28:34,887 --> 01:28:37,157
So...

1282
01:28:39,563 --> 01:28:42,007
What do I
call you?

1283
01:29:36,533 --> 01:29:38,703
<i>( orchestral music playing )</i>
