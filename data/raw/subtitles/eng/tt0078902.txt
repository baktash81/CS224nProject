going to shave your legs?

the Italians do it.

24

don't shave theirs.

00:01:28,068 --> 00:01:29,501
Eh, huh?

26
00:01:34,074 --> 00:01:35,507
Stop!

27
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:44,016
It was somewhere right along here
that I lost all interest in life.

28
00:01:44,084 --> 00:01:46,518
Aha! It was
right here.

29
00:01:46,586 --> 00:01:50,022
This is where I saw
Dolores Reineke...

30
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,024
and fat Marvin!

31
00:01:54,594 --> 00:01:56,528
Why, Dolores?

32
00:01:56,596 --> 00:01:58,029
Why?

33
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:00,532
They're
married now.

34
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:03,466
See what I
saved you from?

35
00:02:03,537 --> 00:02:07,473
If I hadn't told you, you never
would have followed them out here.

36
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:11,341
You made me lose
all interest in life,

37
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:12,936
and I'm grateful.

38
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:22,986
My brother said he saw
you and Nancy, Moocher.

39
00:02:23,056 --> 00:02:24,489
When?

40
00:02:24,558 --> 00:02:25,991
Uh... last Friday.

41
00:02:26,059 --> 00:02:27,492
Well, it wasn't me.

42
00:02:27,561 --> 00:02:29,995
I'm not seeing
her anymore.

43
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:40,505
I kind of
miss school.

44
00:02:40,574 --> 00:02:42,508
This will be
the fýrst time

45
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:45,511
no one will ask us
to write a theme

46
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:47,513
- About how we spent our summer.
- Yeah.

47
00:02:50,484 --> 00:02:52,975
When you're 16,
they call it sweet 16.

48
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:56,021
At 18, you can drink,
vote, and see dirty movies.

49
00:02:56,089 --> 00:02:59,718
What the hell do you get to do
when you're 19?

50
00:03:01,495 --> 00:03:03,292
You leave home.

51
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:05,331
My dad said

52
00:03:05,432 --> 00:03:08,765
Jesus never went further
than 50 miles from his home.

53
00:03:08,835 --> 00:03:11,303
Look what
happened to him.

54
00:03:11,371 --> 00:03:12,804
Whoo!

55
00:03:17,544 --> 00:03:19,239

58
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:27,452
I read where
this Italian coach said

59
00:03:27,554 --> 00:03:30,455
it's no good to swim
right after a race.

60
00:03:30,557 --> 00:03:33,253

and now look at him.

81
00:04:35,322 --> 00:04:37,688
His poor parents.

82
00:04:39,693 --> 00:04:41,661
It's that cologne
he wears.

83
00:04:41,761 --> 00:04:43,991
It's called...

84
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:46,032
Neapolitan
Sunset.

85
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:49,034
Yeah? Well, the flies
seem to like it.

86
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:50,535
There.

87
00:04:53,607 --> 00:04:55,541
This is it?

88
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:58,544
Well, you know what
the doctor said.

89
00:04:58,612 --> 00:05:00,045
At your age...

90
00:05:00,113 --> 00:05:03,480
What the hell
do you mean "at my age"?

91
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,484
Damn see-through coffee.

92
00:05:05,552 --> 00:05:07,986
He says you have
a bad heart.

93
00:05:08,054 --> 00:05:10,488
That's got nothing
to do with my age.

94
00:05:10,557 --> 00:05:12,491
Our son's
ruining my health, Evelyn.

95
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:14,493
What's he going to do?

96
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:18,497
He wanted a year off,
so I give him a year.

97
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:20,499
It hasn't
been a year yet.

98
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:25,004
But, Evelyn, look what's happened
to him. He's turned into an "Ity."

99
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:28,507
"Ciao, Papa. Ciao, mama.
'Arrivederci. '"

100
00:05:28,575 --> 00:05:30,008
That's "Ity" talk.

101
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:33,011
I used to think
it was funny at fýrst.

102
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,512
Not funny anymore.

103
00:05:34,581 --> 00:05:36,515
He was very sickly

104
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,518
until he started riding
around on that bike.

105
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:44,148
Well, now his body's fýne,
but his mind is going.

106
00:05:44,257 --> 00:05:46,521
He used to be
a smart kid.

107
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:49,824
I thought he'd
go to college.

108
00:05:49,896 --> 00:05:52,160
You didn't want him to.

109
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:54,530
Why should he?
I never went.

110
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:58,002
At 19, I worked
in the quarry ten hours a day.

111
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:00,938
Most of the quarries
have closed.

112
00:06:01,007 --> 00:06:03,237
Let him fýnd
another job.

113
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:05,777
Jobs are not
that easy to fýnd.

114
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:08,109
Let him look at least.

115
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:10,411
Let him come home
tired from looking.

116
00:06:10,483 --> 00:06:11,916
He's never tired.

117
00:06:11,985 --> 00:06:13,418
He's never
miserable.

118
00:06:13,486 --> 00:06:14,544
He's young.

119
00:06:14,621 --> 00:06:18,421
When I was young,
I was tired and miserable.

120
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:21,927
I had
my own place at 17.

121
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:25,362
He says Italian families
stay together.

122
00:06:25,432 --> 00:06:27,900
Evelyn,
we are not Italian.

123
00:06:28,001 --> 00:06:29,935
I know, I know.

124
00:06:30,003 --> 00:06:34,440
It's just that I come
from a big family myself,

125
00:06:34,507 --> 00:06:37,442
and it was
kind of nice.

126
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,946
He thinks we should
have another child.

127
00:06:41,014 --> 00:06:41,946
What?

128
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:45,907

00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:48,453

133
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,420
The victory,
she was easy,

134
00:06:56,529 --> 00:06:58,463
but the promoter
tells me

135
00:06:58,531 --> 00:07:01,967
that the Italians
will be here soon.

136
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:05,402
I will race
with the best... <i>Italianos. </i>

137
00:07:05,472 --> 00:07:07,406

they sing.

139
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:12,912
Speaking of flies,
you brought some in.

140
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:15,413
Fly in Italian
is <i>mosca. </i>

141
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:16,915
In English
it's "pest."

142
00:07:16,983 --> 00:07:18,416

143
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:20,919

146
00:07:24,491 --> 00:07:28,427

I never got a trophy.

got a trophy?

148
00:07:30,497 --> 00:07:31,930
Nope, never got one.

540
00:36:32,337 --> 00:36:33,770
I was just wondering

541
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:38,104
if you knew there was a guy
over here serenading Kath.

Good night
and thank you!

00:37:42,473 --> 00:37:43,963
Whoa!

558
00:37:53,618 --> 00:37:55,586
I have to go in.

559
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,997
I haven't
ridden double

560
00:38:07,065 --> 00:38:08,794
since I was
a little girl.

561
00:38:08,866 --> 00:38:11,994
And I've never
been serenaded.

562
00:38:13,638 --> 00:38:15,071
So...

563
00:38:15,139 --> 00:38:17,266
it was
a lovely evening.

564
00:38:19,344 --> 00:38:21,437
<i>Molto grazie. </i>

565
00:38:21,546 --> 00:38:23,104
Right?

566
00:38:30,622 --> 00:38:33,182
<i>Buona notte, Catherina. </i>

567
00:38:37,562 --> 00:38:39,029
I'm fýne!

568
00:38:39,097 --> 00:38:42,032
He won't tell me
who did it.

569
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,034
It was dark!

570
00:38:44,102 --> 00:38:48,539
I only know they
all wore Brut aftershave

571
00:38:48,573 --> 00:38:51,041
and reeked
of Lavoris.

572
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:54,044
Why were you
there by yourself?

573
00:38:54,112 --> 00:38:57,172
I was just
walking.

574
00:38:59,117 --> 00:39:01,984
Well, what kind of car
did they drive?

575
00:39:02,053 --> 00:39:05,989
It was a Mercedes
convertible.

576
00:39:06,057 --> 00:39:08,992
Was it blue?

577
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,220
Yes.

578
00:39:10,328 --> 00:39:13,422
I've seen that car.

579
00:39:13,531 --> 00:39:17,763
They want a fýght,
we'll give them a fýght.

580
00:39:17,835 --> 00:39:19,268
We rednecks are few.

581
00:39:19,337 --> 00:39:23,103
College paleface
students are many.

582
00:39:23,174 --> 00:39:24,664
I counsel peace.

583
00:39:24,776 --> 00:39:27,108
Come on. Let's go fýnd
those bastards.

584
00:39:27,178 --> 00:39:29,009
I have to go
somewhere.

585
00:39:34,285 --> 00:39:36,219
You haven't pledged
any sorority?

586
00:39:36,287 --> 00:39:37,379
No.

587
00:39:37,488 --> 00:39:40,218
You should. Most frat guys
won't date dormies.

588
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:41,724
I'm the exception.

589
00:39:41,793 --> 00:39:46,059
So, you're on
the swimming team, huh?

590
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,757
Yep.

591
00:39:47,865 --> 00:39:49,025
Breaststroke.

595
00:40:07,618 --> 00:40:09,210
I guess.

596
00:40:14,292 --> 00:40:15,418
Who are they?

597
00:40:15,526 --> 00:40:16,959
A bunch of cutters.

598
00:40:17,028 --> 00:40:18,461
What are cutters?

599
00:40:18,529 --> 00:40:20,588
Townies.

600
00:40:25,236 --> 00:40:27,932
There it is.
There's his Mercedes.

601
00:40:28,005 --> 00:40:31,634
Mike, I don't think
we can go in there.

602
00:40:31,743 --> 00:40:34,303
Oh, yeah?
Watch this.

603
00:40:39,751 --> 00:40:41,013
Shit.

604
00:40:41,085 --> 00:40:43,519
<i>Uh, due cappaccino. </i>

605
00:40:43,588 --> 00:40:47,285
Oh, that's
the wrong guy.

606
00:41:01,939 --> 00:41:04,840
A bunch of cutter kids.

607
00:41:14,452 --> 00:41:15,885
There he is.

608
00:41:32,236 --> 00:41:33,168
Hi there.

609
00:41:33,237 --> 00:41:35,671
Would you like
to roll some balls?

610
00:41:44,115 --> 00:41:45,673
Come on, Cyril!

611
00:41:50,621 --> 00:41:52,714
I can't get it out.

612
00:41:55,693 --> 00:41:58,457
My fýnger's stuck.

613
00:42:04,836 --> 00:42:06,770
My papa,
he tells me,

614
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:07,770
<i>"Figlio mio, </i>

615
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,773
"we are fýshermen
in our family

616
00:42:09,841 --> 00:42:13,572
"for as far back
as I can see.

617
00:42:13,644 --> 00:42:16,078
"You... you can do
what you want.

618
00:42:16,147 --> 00:42:17,637
"You go to America.

619
00:42:17,748 --> 00:42:20,546
Say hello
to the new world for me."

620
00:42:20,618 --> 00:42:22,108
My papa.

621
00:42:23,654 --> 00:42:25,588
It's nice you
miss your parents.

622
00:42:25,656 --> 00:42:27,521
<i>Certo, </i> I miss.

623
00:42:27,592 --> 00:42:30,220
Just like you miss
your mama and papa.

624
00:42:30,328 --> 00:42:32,796
I... I don't miss them.

625
00:42:32,864 --> 00:42:36,800
I went as far as I could
to get away from them.

626
00:42:36,868 --> 00:42:38,301
They miss you.

627
00:42:38,369 --> 00:42:41,770
At home, they sit,
and they look at your photo,

628
00:42:41,806 --> 00:42:43,296
and they say,

629
00:42:43,407 --> 00:42:46,672
"Ah, how we miss
our Catherina,

630
00:42:46,744 --> 00:42:48,735
our bambina."

631
00:42:57,555 --> 00:42:59,523
You shouldn't smoke.

632
00:43:01,158 --> 00:43:03,126
What's your major?

633
00:43:03,194 --> 00:43:04,252
Sosh.

634
00:43:04,362 --> 00:43:06,762
Oh, sosh.
That's a nice major.

635
00:43:06,831 --> 00:43:08,765
Would you mind if I...

636
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:11,063
What are you
cutters doing here?

637
00:43:12,837 --> 00:43:14,771
Did you get lost?

638
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:16,431
No.

639
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:19,031
Then why don't you
get lost now?

640
00:43:22,613 --> 00:43:23,671
Is that him?

641
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:29,484
Uh... no.
No, I don't think it is.

642
00:43:31,122 --> 00:43:33,113
Let's get
out of here.

643
00:43:33,224 --> 00:43:34,350
Smart move, shorty.

644
00:44:20,638 --> 00:44:22,868
All right!
Break it up!

645
00:44:24,175 --> 00:44:25,767
Oh, shit.

646
00:44:28,312 --> 00:44:29,404
Break it up!

647
00:44:29,513 --> 00:44:30,980
We gotta go now.

648
00:44:31,082 --> 00:44:32,606
Come on.

649
00:44:37,088 --> 00:44:39,022
Cutters started it!

650
00:44:41,993 --> 00:44:44,928
Break it up, everybody.
Get out of there.

651
00:44:45,029 --> 00:44:46,394
Move it!
Let's go!

652
00:44:49,633 --> 00:44:52,625
Most of you will only spend
four years here,

653
00:44:52,737 --> 00:44:56,537
but to a lot of us,
Bloomington is our home.

654
00:44:56,607 --> 00:44:59,633
I don't like how you've
been behaving in my home.

655
00:44:59,744 --> 00:45:03,942
If you feel compelled to compete
with the kids from the town,

656
00:45:04,015 --> 00:45:06,643
you will do it in
a different arena.

657
00:45:06,751 --> 00:45:11,654
We're expanding this year's
Little 500 bicycle race

658
00:45:11,722 --> 00:45:14,384
to include
a team from the town.

659
00:45:14,492 --> 00:45:16,119
But they're not
good enough.

660
00:45:17,962 --> 00:45:22,331
I don't want to be
in the Little 500.

661
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,391
Oh, Christ.

662
00:45:24,502 --> 00:45:27,437
I thought you'd jump
at the chance.

663
00:45:27,505 --> 00:45:31,464
I don't want to be seen
with all those college kids.

664
00:45:31,575 --> 00:45:33,509
That's the point!

665
00:45:33,577 --> 00:45:36,512
Don't you want to beat
those shitheads

666
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,377
in front
of everybody?

667
00:45:38,482 --> 00:45:40,882
Doesn't it take four
to have a team?

668
00:45:40,951 --> 00:45:42,384
Well, we got four...

669
00:45:42,453 --> 00:45:44,387
I mean, don't we?

670
00:45:46,323 --> 00:45:49,292
We all enter,
Dave rides the whole thing,

671
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,793
and we win!

672
00:45:50,861 --> 00:45:52,158
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

673
00:45:52,263 --> 00:45:53,195
Uh...

674
00:45:53,264 --> 00:45:54,526
Iook, Mike.

675
00:45:54,632 --> 00:45:57,100
I'm going to be working
that day, O.K.?

676
00:45:57,201 --> 00:45:58,190
Working?

677
00:45:58,302 --> 00:46:01,135
Yeah, I'm getting a job.

678
00:46:01,205 --> 00:46:02,433
By yourself?

679
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:06,009
Yeah!
I need the money.

680
00:46:06,077 --> 00:46:08,011
Thanks, Dave.
That's really great.

681
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:09,740
You're a real pal!

682
00:46:09,847 --> 00:46:11,280
You won't be working

683
00:46:11,348 --> 00:46:13,145
the day of
the Italian race.

684
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:17,277
The time comes
when we all have to go our own ways.

685
00:46:17,388 --> 00:46:19,856
You're a real adult,
aren't you?

686
00:46:19,924 --> 00:46:22,484
B-town boy grows up.

687
00:46:22,593 --> 00:46:24,993
It's going to happen
sometime.

688
00:46:25,029 --> 00:46:26,462
Oh, yeah.

689
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:28,464
Is that what
Nancy says?

690
00:46:28,532 --> 00:46:30,659
Just leave her
out of this.

691
00:46:30,768 --> 00:46:33,703
Shut up, would you?
I wasn't talking to you.

692
00:46:33,771 --> 00:46:37,468
Hey, well,
I don't give a damn!

693
00:46:37,575 --> 00:46:40,009
You're not
the quarterback here, Mike!

694
00:46:40,044 --> 00:46:42,012
At least I was once!

695
00:46:42,046 --> 00:46:45,072
Which is better than being
a midget all my life!

696
00:46:45,182 --> 00:46:47,980
Cut it out!
Just cut it out!

697
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:58,992
Hey, <i>bambino, </i>
<i>che cosa? </i>

698
00:46:59,063 --> 00:47:01,031
Just drop that Italian,
all right?

699
00:47:01,065 --> 00:47:03,499
I'm really sick
of that crap.

700
00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:07,599
Oh, shit!

701
00:47:07,705 --> 00:47:11,141
You're just afraid
of those college guys.

702
00:47:11,208 --> 00:47:13,699
And you're not,
right, Mike?

703
00:47:13,811 --> 00:47:15,745
The only thing
I'm afraid of

704
00:47:15,813 --> 00:47:18,281
is wasting my life
with you guys!

705
00:47:18,382 --> 00:47:20,441
I thought that was
the whole plan,

706
00:47:20,551 --> 00:47:23,452
that we were going
to waste our lives together.

707
00:48:03,928 --> 00:48:05,418
What's he doing?
That guy...

708
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:23,476
Come on, Rod!

709
00:48:25,149 --> 00:48:26,810
Come on, Mike!

710
00:48:39,763 --> 00:48:41,230
Yay, Rod! Whoo!

711
00:48:41,298 --> 00:48:42,765
[Cheering]

712
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:49,900
Come on, Rod!

713
00:48:51,775 --> 00:48:54,175
You can do it!
Come on, Mike!

714
00:49:18,502 --> 00:49:19,833
Yay, Rod!

715
00:49:27,878 --> 00:49:28,936

Come on!

896
01:03:36,659 --> 01:03:38,126
Hey!

897
01:03:53,443 --> 01:03:54,967
Hey!

898
01:04:37,086 --> 01:04:38,553
<i>Buon giorno! </i>

899
01:04:40,056 --> 01:04:41,216
<i>Come'sta? </i>

900
01:04:44,894 --> 01:04:48,762
<i>Oggi e molto umido, </i>
<i>non e vero? </i>

901
01:04:48,865 --> 01:04:50,059
<i>Niento vero. </i>

902
01:05:01,844 --> 01:05:04,074
<i>Grazie! Grazie! </i>

903
01:05:04,147 --> 01:05:05,136
<i>Grazie! </i>

904
01:06:04,107 --> 01:06:07,599
<i>Che tempo</i>
<i>fara piovera! </i>

905
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:08,734
<i>Filare! </i>

906
01:06:34,771 --> 01:06:36,398
Bravo! Bravo!

907
01:06:59,028 --> 01:07:02,156
I feel like one
of those dwarfs,

908
01:07:02,231 --> 01:07:05,257
like, when they think
that Snow White's dead.

909
01:07:09,505 --> 01:07:11,973
Well, I guess you're
a cutter again, huh?

910
01:07:12,041 --> 01:07:14,066
Just like the rest of us?

911
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:18,172
I guess so.

912
01:07:24,487 --> 01:07:25,715
Hey, cheer up, Dave.

913
01:07:25,788 --> 01:07:27,722
You still got the 500.

914
01:07:32,295 --> 01:07:33,489
Thanks a lot.

915
01:07:38,368 --> 01:07:40,802
No, I don't feel lucky
to be alive.

916
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:42,804
I feel lucky
I'm not dead.

917
01:07:42,872 --> 01:07:44,305
There's a difference.

918
01:07:46,275 --> 01:07:49,574
Oh! What
happened to you?

919
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,313
Oh, it's nothing, Ma.

920
01:07:52,382 --> 01:07:55,613
How do you feel, Dad?

921
01:07:55,685 --> 01:07:57,050
" Dad"?

922
01:07:58,154 --> 01:08:01,749
I'll tell you how
I'm feeling, son.

923
01:08:01,824 --> 01:08:04,292
I had nightmares
all night

924
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:07,158
that every customer
I ever had

925
01:08:07,230 --> 01:08:09,323
came in to ask
for a refund.

926
01:08:09,432 --> 01:08:11,400
You were there
handing out checks.

927
01:08:11,467 --> 01:08:13,765
"One for you,
one for you..."

928
01:08:13,836 --> 01:08:16,999
I'm sorry I gave him
back his money.

929
01:08:17,073 --> 01:08:19,200
I really am.

930
01:08:21,978 --> 01:08:23,878
Everybody cheats.

931
01:08:25,681 --> 01:08:27,876
I just didn't know.

932
01:08:29,986 --> 01:08:31,749
Well, now you know.

933
01:08:36,726 --> 01:08:38,091
Where's your trophy?

934
01:08:42,598 --> 01:08:43,565
Daddy!

935
01:08:45,635 --> 01:08:47,364
What's the matter?

936
01:08:47,437 --> 01:08:49,371
What are you
crying for?

937
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:51,873
It's not like you
lost your wallet.

938
01:08:51,941 --> 01:08:54,375
I didn't want you
to be this miserable.

939
01:08:54,444 --> 01:08:58,039
A little bit's
all I asked for.

940
01:08:59,782 --> 01:09:01,306
Come on now.

941
01:09:05,721 --> 01:09:07,655
Talk to him, Evelyn.

942
01:09:09,459 --> 01:09:11,484
What are you doing?

943
01:09:22,104 --> 01:09:24,470
Hi, Kathy.

944
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:26,838
What did you do
to yourself?

945
01:09:26,909 --> 01:09:28,843
Oh, I liked you
better before.

946
01:09:28,911 --> 01:09:31,402
What happened
to your <i>cornocello? </i>

947
01:09:34,617 --> 01:09:37,552
Now you look like
everybody else.

948
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:39,485
I am everybody else.

949
01:09:39,555 --> 01:09:40,988
I mean...

950
01:09:41,057 --> 01:09:42,615
Listen, Kathy...

951
01:09:42,692 --> 01:09:43,784
Catherina!

952
01:09:47,864 --> 01:09:50,025
I feel terrible.

953
01:09:51,501 --> 01:09:53,696
You sound funny.

954
01:09:55,204 --> 01:09:56,637
<i>Che cosa, Enrico? </i>

955
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:02,143
Tell me.

956
01:10:04,714 --> 01:10:06,045
Look...

957
01:10:06,115 --> 01:10:07,548
Kathy, I...

958
01:10:07,617 --> 01:10:08,982
My name is
Dave Stohler.

959
01:10:09,051 --> 01:10:12,282
I made all
that other stuff up.

960
01:10:12,355 --> 01:10:14,220
I was born in Bloomington.

961
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:16,724
I went to
Bloomington high.

962
01:10:16,792 --> 01:10:20,228
I was treasurer
of the Latin Club...

963
01:10:20,296 --> 01:10:21,729
Stop kidding
around.

964
01:10:21,797 --> 01:10:23,731
I'm not
kidding around!

965
01:10:27,737 --> 01:10:28,829
See...

966
01:10:31,374 --> 01:10:34,468
I'm what you
call a cutter.

967
01:10:39,682 --> 01:10:41,115
Oh, and Napoli?

968
01:10:43,019 --> 01:10:44,953
And the
big family?

969
01:10:49,659 --> 01:10:53,117
Well, it was
a good act.

970
01:10:53,195 --> 01:10:54,787
You...

971
01:10:54,864 --> 01:10:57,094
You certainly
fooled me.

972
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:10,644
You know
what you are?

973
01:11:10,713 --> 01:11:12,647
I got a clue.

974
01:11:12,715 --> 01:11:15,650
I'll tell you
what you are.

975
01:11:22,391 --> 01:11:24,484
Oh, God!

976
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:25,492
You...

977
01:11:51,253 --> 01:11:52,413
Dave.

978
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:55,918
Yes, Dad?

979
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:06,134
I cut the stone
for this building.

980
01:12:06,202 --> 01:12:08,136
You did?

981
01:12:08,204 --> 01:12:11,640
Yeah. I was one
fýne stonecutter.

982
01:12:11,707 --> 01:12:14,938
Mike's dad,
Moocher's, Cyril's...

983
01:12:15,011 --> 01:12:16,638
all of us.

984
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:20,080
Well, Cyril's dad...

985
01:12:20,149 --> 01:12:21,138
never mind.

986
01:12:25,721 --> 01:12:29,157
Thing of it was,
I loved it.

987
01:12:30,726 --> 01:12:35,322
I was young
and slim and strong.

988
01:12:35,398 --> 01:12:38,834
I was damn
proud of my work.

989
01:12:38,901 --> 01:12:41,335
And the buildings
went up.

990
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:48,676
When they were fýnished,
the damnedest thing happened.

991
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:51,512
It was like...

992
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:55,016
the buildings
was too good for us.

993
01:12:55,084 --> 01:12:57,018
Nobody told us that.

994
01:12:58,254 --> 01:12:59,346
Just...

995
01:13:00,923 --> 01:13:03,357
Just felt uncomfortable,
that's all.

996
01:13:05,594 --> 01:13:07,027
Even now, I...

997
01:13:07,096 --> 01:13:11,533
I'd like to be able
to stroll through the campus

998
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,034
and look
at the limestone,

999
01:13:14,103 --> 01:13:17,539
but I just feel
out of place.

1000
01:13:20,276 --> 01:13:23,712
You guys still go swimming
in the quarries?

1001
01:13:23,779 --> 01:13:24,871
Sure.

1002
01:13:25,948 --> 01:13:28,382
All you got to show

1003
01:13:28,451 --> 01:13:31,386
for my 20 years of work

1004
01:13:31,454 --> 01:13:34,389
is the holes
we left behind.

1005
01:13:35,791 --> 01:13:37,725
I don't mind.

1006
01:13:39,395 --> 01:13:41,488
I do.

1007
01:13:41,564 --> 01:13:47,002
Cyril's dad says he took
that college exam.

1008
01:13:47,069 --> 01:13:49,663
We both took it.

1009
01:13:49,739 --> 01:13:52,674
How did
both of us do?

1010
01:13:53,743 --> 01:13:55,677
Well,
I don't know.

1011
01:13:57,113 --> 01:14:00,082
One of us
did O.K.

1012
01:14:00,149 --> 01:14:02,310
But neither...

1013
01:14:02,384 --> 01:14:03,316
of us...

1014
01:14:03,385 --> 01:14:04,352
Hell, I...

1015
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:08,220
don't want to go
to college, Dad!

1016
01:14:08,290 --> 01:14:10,224
To hell with them!

1017
01:14:10,292 --> 01:14:12,783
I'm proud
of being a cutter.

1018
01:14:14,296 --> 01:14:16,230
You're not a cutter.

1019
01:14:16,298 --> 01:14:17,731
I'm a cutter.

1020
01:14:19,135 --> 01:14:21,035
What,
are you afraid?

1021
01:14:22,304 --> 01:14:23,396
Yeah.

1022
01:14:24,607 --> 01:14:26,040
A little bit.

1023
01:14:28,744 --> 01:14:32,578
And then there's
the rest of the guys.

1024
01:14:37,586 --> 01:14:40,851
Well, you
took the exam.

1025
01:14:40,923 --> 01:14:43,357
Did all right,
didn't you?

1026
01:14:45,928 --> 01:14:47,520
Yes.

1027
01:14:47,596 --> 01:14:49,029
Well, that's...

1028
01:14:50,099 --> 01:14:51,532
That's good.

1029
01:14:53,435 --> 01:14:54,868
Well, your mom...

1030
01:14:58,941 --> 01:15:02,377
Your mom will be
expecting us home.

1031
01:15:09,118 --> 01:15:10,551
Come on.

1032
01:15:22,298 --> 01:15:24,664
I'm supposed to
ride this thing?

1033
01:15:24,733 --> 01:15:26,667
Well, that's
the offýcial issue.

1034
01:15:26,735 --> 01:15:28,669
You can't add or
change anything.

1035
01:15:28,737 --> 01:15:32,833
Well, it's a
piece of junk!

1036
01:15:32,908 --> 01:15:36,674
Hey, it's got a lot
of personality to it.

1037
01:15:36,745 --> 01:15:39,680
It doesn't look
that bad to me.

1038
01:15:39,748 --> 01:15:42,683
That's 'cause
you don't have to ride it.

1039
01:15:44,753 --> 01:15:46,345
You don't have to ride.

1040
01:15:46,422 --> 01:15:48,356
We're not going to beg you.

1041
01:15:48,424 --> 01:15:50,756
We'll plead,
but never beg.

1042
01:15:50,826 --> 01:15:52,851
The hell with it!

1043
01:15:52,928 --> 01:15:54,361
Get off, Cyril.

1044
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:56,796
At least
we got invited.

1045
01:15:59,268 --> 01:16:02,032
I'll just
take it back.

1046
01:16:02,104 --> 01:16:04,538
You seem
relieved, Mike.

1047
01:16:04,607 --> 01:16:08,099
Don't you think
we can win anymore?

1048
01:16:10,546 --> 01:16:12,878
Why not?

1049
01:16:12,948 --> 01:16:16,406
Maybe those guys
<i>are</i> better than us.

1050
01:16:18,787 --> 01:16:22,780
That's the fýrst
time you ever said that!

1051
01:16:22,858 --> 01:16:27,124
That's the fýrst time
I ever felt that.

1052
01:16:32,134 --> 01:16:33,567
All right.

1053
01:18:18,707 --> 01:18:20,174
Hello.

1054
01:18:23,812 --> 01:18:25,746
What are you
doing here?

1055
01:18:27,816 --> 01:18:29,477
I'm leaving soon.

1056
01:18:30,886 --> 01:18:32,683
Where are you going?

1057
01:18:32,755 --> 01:18:34,882
I got a job
in Chicago.

1058
01:18:34,957 --> 01:18:37,391
Moocher's dad got
a job in Chicago.

1059
01:18:37,459 --> 01:18:38,323
He's, uh...

1060
01:18:43,966 --> 01:18:49,063
I'm going to Italy
after all with my parents.

1061
01:18:49,138 --> 01:18:50,901
Great, Kath.

1062
01:18:50,973 --> 01:18:53,908
I wish you
a nice trip.

1063
01:18:53,976 --> 01:18:55,500
You, too.

1064
01:18:55,577 --> 01:18:57,511
I'm not going
anywhere.

1065
01:18:59,815 --> 01:19:02,477
I don't know
about that.

1066
01:19:10,059 --> 01:19:10,991
Thank you.

1067
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:12,152
You're welcome.

1068
01:19:12,227 --> 01:19:16,163
If you eat so much,
how come you're small?

1069
01:19:16,231 --> 01:19:17,664
Oh, it's my
metabolism.

1070
01:19:17,733 --> 01:19:20,327
I eat three
times a day.

1071
01:19:20,402 --> 01:19:23,337
My metabolism
eats fýve times a day.

1072
01:19:24,406 --> 01:19:26,840
Well, I go back
to work tomorrow.

1073
01:19:26,909 --> 01:19:28,843
You won't
watch us race?

1074
01:19:28,911 --> 01:19:31,846
He thought he might
bring you bad luck.

1075
01:19:31,914 --> 01:19:35,179
Well, I just have
work to do, that's all.

1076
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:39,778
Besides, there might be
another metabolism to feed here.

1077
01:19:39,855 --> 01:19:41,914
We might be
a father?

1078
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:44,788
No, <i>I</i> might be a father.
Your mom might be a mother.

1079
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:47,124
You might be a brother.

1080
01:19:47,196 --> 01:19:50,723
That way, I keep it
all in the family.

1081
01:19:50,799 --> 01:19:53,859
I didn't think
people your age...

1082
01:19:53,936 --> 01:19:57,633
The next word
may be your last.

1083
01:19:57,706 --> 01:20:00,197
You must
be very happy.

1084
01:20:00,275 --> 01:20:02,869
Do I have
any choice?

1085
01:20:02,945 --> 01:20:06,813
You were going
to give a pep talk.

1086
01:20:06,882 --> 01:20:08,816
They don't need pep.

1087
01:20:08,884 --> 01:20:10,317
I need pep.

1088
01:20:10,385 --> 01:20:13,320
Go on,
give it to them.

1089
01:20:20,729 --> 01:20:22,162
Uh, we thought...

1090
01:20:22,231 --> 01:20:24,165
As long as
you're out there,

1091
01:20:24,233 --> 01:20:27,327
you might as well
tell them who you are.

1092
01:20:27,402 --> 01:20:28,494
Right.

1093
01:20:30,072 --> 01:20:33,166

1111
01:22:00,162 --> 01:22:02,960
Gentlemen,
thank you very much.

1112
01:22:03,031 --> 01:22:08,435
I want to point out three flags
you'll have to obey.

1113
01:22:08,503 --> 01:22:12,940
First, the green flag
means the race is on.

1114
01:22:13,008 --> 01:22:16,444
The green flag means
you are racing.

1115
01:22:16,511 --> 01:22:20,311
The yellow flag means
there's been an accident

1116
01:22:20,382 --> 01:22:26,287
or someone has a problem
that will slow down the track.

1117
01:22:26,355 --> 01:22:28,289
Please follow
your leader.

1118
01:22:28,357 --> 01:22:33,522
The third flag is
the checkered flag.

1119
01:22:33,595 --> 01:22:35,825
This needs
no explanation.

1120
01:22:49,144 --> 01:22:54,673
This is a 200-lap,
50-mile bicycle race.

1121
01:22:56,485 --> 01:23:00,251
It will consist of 33
4-man teams.

1122
01:23:00,322 --> 01:23:02,256
For the fýrst year,

1123
01:23:02,324 --> 01:23:07,387
an out-of-town team has
been invited to participate.

1124
01:23:07,462 --> 01:23:11,762
I'm sure they'll give
their best effort.

1125
01:23:11,833 --> 01:23:14,267
The Cutters,
ladies and gentlemen.

1126
01:23:15,570 --> 01:23:21,270
Any team members may exchange
to another team member

1127
01:23:21,343 --> 01:23:25,575
whenever they feel exhausted
or in need of help.

1128
01:23:27,249 --> 01:23:28,477
Gentlemen...

1129
01:23:30,319 --> 01:23:33,686
mount your
Roadmaster bicycle.

01:23:33,755 --> 01:23:35,689

The green flag is up!

The Little 500

1154
01:25:18,894 --> 01:25:21,829
And here they come,
rounding the corner

1155
01:25:21,897 --> 01:25:26,061
for the completion of
the fýrst of 200 laps today.

1156
01:25:56,565 --> 01:25:57,998
<i>So after 25 laps, </i>

<i>The Sigma Tau Omega team</i>
<i>and the Acacia team. </i>

1160
01:26:04,072 --> 01:26:05,505
<i>I should point out</i>

1161
01:26:05,574 --> 01:26:08,008
<i>what a remarkable job</i>
<i>the Cutter team is doing. </i>

1162
01:26:08,076 --> 01:26:10,010
<i>They started in</i>
<i>34th position</i>

1163
01:26:10,078 --> 01:26:12,672
<i>and are moving up</i>
<i>through the field. </i>

1164
01:26:12,747 --> 01:26:13,941
Oh...

1165
01:26:15,417 --> 01:26:19,513
<i>The Acacia team just signaled</i>
<i>for an exchange. </i>

1166
01:26:19,588 --> 01:26:22,887
<i>The single rider is</i>
<i>accelerating away, </i>

1167
01:26:22,958 --> 01:26:26,359
<i>getting a lead</i>
<i>so the receiver</i>

1168
01:26:26,428 --> 01:26:30,159
<i>will not be behind</i>
<i>when the pack comes by. </i>

1169
01:26:30,232 --> 01:26:31,529
<i>Beautiful exchange! </i>

1170
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,034
<i>The other team is exchanging</i>
<i>right behind them. </i>

1171
01:26:35,837 --> 01:26:37,270
<i>Sigma Tau Omega team. </i>

1172
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:41,975
<i>Another team is moving in</i>
<i>on the outside. </i>

1173
01:26:42,043 --> 01:26:44,913
<i>It's team 34,</i>
<i>the Cutter team. </i>

1174
01:26:45,046 --> 01:26:47,981
<i>He is fighting hard</i>
<i>to take the lead. </i>

1175
01:26:48,049 --> 01:26:50,483
<i>He has taken the lead! </i>

1176
01:26:50,552 --> 01:26:52,986

1191
01:27:59,654 --> 01:28:01,019
He won't last.

1192
01:28:02,991 --> 01:28:04,424
<i>It's utterly amazing. </i>

1193
01:28:04,492 --> 01:28:08,861
<i>After 25 miles</i>...

1194
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:11,990
the rider for the Cutters
is still out front.

1195
01:28:12,067 --> 01:28:15,400
<i>He has yet to</i>
<i>come in for an exchange. </i>

1196
01:28:18,273 --> 01:28:19,968
We're
number one!

1197
01:28:27,315 --> 01:28:30,011
<i>Someone's down. </i>
<i>There's an accident. </i>

1198

<i>I can't see who. </i>

1199
01:28:31,486 --> 01:28:32,919
<i>Just a second. </i>

1200
01:28:32,988 --> 01:28:36,424
<i>It's Dave Stohler</i>
<i>from the Cutter team. </i>

1201
01:28:36,491 --> 01:28:39,358
<i>He had a 3/4</i>-<i>lap lead. </i>

1202
01:28:39,427 --> 01:28:42,191
<i>I can't see</i>
<i>if he's hurt. </i>

1203
01:28:42,263 --> 01:28:45,027
<i>He's getting back</i>
<i>on the bike, </i>

1204
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:47,534
<i>but he's obviously</i>
<i>in agony. </i>

Come on, Dave!

1206
01:28:50,438 --> 01:28:52,372
No way.
He wants off, man.

1207
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:53,873
That's the signal.

1208
01:28:53,942 --> 01:28:55,466

Here you go.

1210
01:29:00,682 --> 01:29:03,674

1215
01:29:17,999 --> 01:29:19,432
No one is going.

1216
01:29:19,501 --> 01:29:21,867

01:29:33,882 --> 01:29:34,814

happened?

Well, Ev, he tried.

1230
01:30:15,190 --> 01:30:18,125

<i>like the wind. </i>

1239
01:31:35,270 --> 01:31:37,738
Stay on
this side.

1240
01:31:40,208 --> 01:31:41,641
Bring it in!

1241
01:31:50,618 --> 01:31:53,178
Go, you Cutter, go!

1242
01:32:05,166 --> 01:32:09,262
<i>The Cutters now have</i>
<i>a new man on the bike. </i>

1243
01:32:09,337 --> 01:32:12,363
<i>He's doing a good job. </i>

1244
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:16,206
<i>He has moved the Cutters</i>
<i>into fourth position. </i>

1245
01:32:16,277 --> 01:32:20,543
<i>He might make a serious</i>
<i>challenge for third position. </i>

1246
01:32:20,615 --> 01:32:23,948
<i>We'll wait to see</i>
<i>if this happens. </i>

1247
01:32:24,018 --> 01:32:26,919
We're not
doing too bad.

1248
01:32:29,958 --> 01:32:32,449
<i>This once again points out</i>

1249
01:32:32,527 --> 01:32:35,325
<i>the fact that this</i>
<i>is a team effort. </i>

1250
01:32:35,396 --> 01:32:39,833
<i>One man may fall back, </i>
<i>another may be exceptional... </i>

1251
01:32:58,386 --> 01:33:00,047
We showed them.

1252
01:33:00,121 --> 01:33:01,554
Showed them what?

1253
01:33:04,792 --> 01:33:07,886
Come on, Mike!
Bring it in!

1254
01:33:07,962 --> 01:33:09,429
Come on!

1255
01:33:22,210 --> 01:33:24,405
<i>Stohler is on the bike, </i>

1256
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:28,916
<i>his teammates are taping</i>
<i>his feet to the pedals. </i>

1257
01:33:28,983 --> 01:33:33,420
<i>This means he won't be able</i>
<i>to exchange riders. </i>

1258
01:33:33,488 --> 01:33:37,083
<i>He must ride</i>
<i>15 laps by himself. </i>

1259
01:33:37,158 --> 01:33:38,523
Pick it up!

1260
01:33:38,593 --> 01:33:40,527
Pick it up!

1261
01:33:40,595 --> 01:33:42,028
Pick it up!

1262
01:33:42,096 --> 01:33:44,530
He's back in
the race!

1263
01:33:44,599 --> 01:33:49,036
<i>He has dropped from fourth</i>
<i>into sixth position. </i>

1264
01:33:49,103 --> 01:33:51,128
<i>There are only</i>
<i>15 laps remaining. </i>

1265
01:33:51,205 --> 01:33:54,538
Go, son!
Go, damn you!

1266
01:34:31,145 --> 01:34:34,080
Stay behind him
till the third turn.

1267
01:35:02,977 --> 01:35:05,411
<i>The Cutters, </i>
<i>team number 34,</i>

1268
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:06,913
<i>now in second place. </i>

1269
01:35:06,981 --> 01:35:11,543
<i>They have completed</i>
<i>198 laps. </i>

1270
01:35:11,619 --> 01:35:13,519
<i>198 laps! </i>

1271
01:35:14,956 --> 01:35:18,892
<i>Still leading, Sigma Tau Omega, </i>
<i>team number 1.</i>

1272
01:35:36,811 --> 01:35:40,178
<i>And here comes your leader</i>
<i>through turn number four. </i>

1273
01:35:40,248 --> 01:35:43,684
<i>Coming down</i>
<i>to take the white flag! </i>

1274
01:35:43,751 --> 01:35:45,685
<i>One lap to go! </i>

1275
01:35:45,753 --> 01:35:50,019
<i>It's a duel between</i>
<i>Sigma Tau Omega and Cutters, </i>

1276
01:35:50,091 --> 01:35:52,025
<i>teams number 1 and 34,</i>

1277
01:35:52,093 --> 01:35:55,028
<i>as they battle out</i>
<i>through the last lap. </i>

1278
01:35:57,098 --> 01:36:01,535
<i>Teams number 1 and 34</i>
<i>battling neck</i>-<i>and</i>-<i>neck</i>

1279
01:36:01,602 --> 01:36:04,867
<i>as they come down</i>
<i>the short stretch. </i>

1280
01:36:04,939 --> 01:36:07,203
<i>Half a lap to go. </i>

1281
01:36:07,275 --> 01:36:10,039
<i>They're going into</i>
<i>turn number three. </i>

1282
01:36:10,111 --> 01:36:12,045
<i>Number 1,</i>
<i>still leading. </i>

1283
01:36:12,113 --> 01:36:15,378
<i>34 coming up very close</i>
<i>on the inside! </i>

1284
01:36:15,450 --> 01:36:17,884
<i>They're going</i>
<i>for the checkered flag! </i>

1285
01:36:17,952 --> 01:36:19,520
<i>And 34 wins! </i>

1286
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:20,418
<i>And 34 wins! </i>

1287
01:37:23,184 --> 01:37:26,711
And now, this is what
you have been waiting for.

1288
01:37:26,787 --> 01:37:28,379
The winning team,

1289
01:37:28,456 --> 01:37:30,390
from Bloomington,
Indiana,

1290
01:37:30,458 --> 01:37:33,393
the winner of
the Little 500...

1291
01:37:33,461 --> 01:37:34,826
The Cutters!

1292
01:38:17,705 --> 01:38:18,763
Bye.

1293
01:38:29,617 --> 01:38:30,743
Pardon.

1294
01:38:30,818 --> 01:38:33,252
Do you know where
is the Offýce of the Purser?

1295
01:38:35,790 --> 01:38:38,156
You must mean
the Bursar's Offýce.

1296
01:38:38,226 --> 01:38:39,284
Uh...

1297
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:40,987
<i>oui, </i> Bursar.

1298
01:38:42,964 --> 01:38:44,898
I was thinking
of taking French,

1299
01:38:44,966 --> 01:38:46,399
but it's
my fýrst year.

1300
01:38:46,467 --> 01:38:49,664
Have you seen
<i>Le Tour de France? </i>

1301
01:38:49,737 --> 01:38:50,669
No.

1302
01:38:50,738 --> 01:38:52,672
No? <i>Mon dieu! </i>

1303
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:56,267
The French riders,
they're the best!

1304
01:38:56,344 --> 01:38:57,777
Hiya, big shot!

1305
01:38:57,845 --> 01:38:59,278
