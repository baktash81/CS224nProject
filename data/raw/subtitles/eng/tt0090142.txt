1
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,516
Time.

2
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,717
You guys suck.

3
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,670
No, really?

4
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,150
You're looking good.
Nothing to worry about. It's fine.

5
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,073
Hot, isn't it?
Shouldn't have gotten in his way, Scottie.

6
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,516
- Looking good out there, babe.
- How would you know, Stiles?

7
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,992
- You want to forfeit the game?
- Yeah, what's wrong with that?

8
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,309
- No.
- No?

9
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,711
My players have
league scoring records at stake.

10
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,235
If we quit now you can beat the traffic.

11
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,520
- There's a lot to learn from losing.
- We'll play if it's that big a deal to you.

12
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,750
Over here, over here!

13
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,592
Push it up.

14
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,392
- It's not going too well, is it?
- Look at their sneakers.

15
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,950
If our guys had sneakers like that
who knows what they could do.

16
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,917
Shoot.

17
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,679
We're all open.

18
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,910
That fat kid's got a great arm.

19
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,638
Over here. Pass it.

20
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,791
Forget it, dork.

21
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,233
Nice try.

22
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,911
I wanna get out of here.

23
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,270
It's not that bad. First game
of the season, 11 more to go.

24
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,078
It's just a game.

25
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,277
You better shape up.
I can't do this all by myself.

26
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,955
- What is that? Liverwurst?
- What?

27
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,513
- I thought you were on a diet, Chub.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

28
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,319
Chub, look at this.

29
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,992
Give me that.
Stop snooping around in my locker.

30
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,755
Look, I can smell
that liverwurst from over there.

31
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,832
Oh, yeah, right. Underneath these?

32
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,039
All right. Great game, guys.
We showed them.

33
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,034
- We lost, Stiles.
- The umpire needed glasses.

34
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,112
- Remember that seven buck s?
- You owe me.

35
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,636
Without a keg,
they won't let me into the party.

36
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,837
- Where would you buy it anyway?
- Lend me five.

37
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,592
- Later.
- Two.

38
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:48,677
Hey, Chub, how's the diet?
Lemonade, you were terrific.

39
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,876
What the hell is that?

40
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,712
Lemonade, my man. What it is?

41
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,510
I'm raising some cash
for the Afro-American festival...

42
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,829
Can we talk?

43
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,277
Hey, Scottie, come on in.

44
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,673
- Great game. Want a thigh or a wing?
- That's not necessary, coach.

45
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:29,075
You said that if we had problems,
we should come to you.

46
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:35,554
- That's what I'm here for.
- Great, because I got a problem.

47
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,350
What kind of problem?
As you can see, I'm a very busy man.

48
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,435
- It's kind of complicated.
- Oh, those kinds of problems.

49
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,833
What is it? Drugs? Girls?
I'd like to help, but I'm tapped out.

50
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,437
The IRS is breathing down my neck
like it's a personal vendetta.

51
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,230
No, coach. How can I put this?

52
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,550
I'm going through changes.

53
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,269
Don't worry about that.
We all go through that.

54
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,317
Some a bit later than others.

55
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,995
Sorry I didn't notice.
I haven't been in the locker room much.

56
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:19,191
I don't think it's gonna be possible
for me to play on the team anymore.

57
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,559
Oh, yeah? Well look,
I know what you're going through.

58
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,474
A couple years back
a kid came to me the same way.

59
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,234
Saying to me
the same thing you're saying.

60
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,516
He wanted to drop off the team.

61
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,798
His mother was a widow, all crippled up.
She was scrubbing floors.

62
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:43,353
She had a pin in her hip.
He wanted to drop basketball and get a job.

63
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,752
Now these were poor people.
Hungry people with real problems.

64
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,070
Understand what I'm saying?

65
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,633
What happened to the kid?

66
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,190
I don't know. He quit.
Third stringer, I didn't need him.

67
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,310
- I'm a first stringer.
- And you work for your old man.

68
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,439
I should be coming to you
when I need money.

69
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,233
Fine. Thank s a lot, coach.

70
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,678
Don't mention it.
Like I said before <i>Mi casa su casa</i>.

71
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,751
Thank s.

72
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,868
Are you going to work?
Will you walk with me?

73
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,158
- Catch you later, Boof.
- Bye, Tina... Sheena..?

74
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,710
I had the strangest dream.
It was bizarre.

75
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,396
- Was I in this one?
- You, Pamela and a bunch of chickens.

76
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,596
- How the hell are you?
- Say no.

77
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,512
- Great talking to you.
- Chickens?

78
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,877
Yeah, big chickens. Giant chickens.
Like fryers.

79
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,794
- That guy was right. We do suck.
- No news there.

80
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,589
71-12. I don't even know
what I'm doing out there.

81
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,515
I'm sick of it, Boof.
I'm sick of being so average.

82
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,993
And it's not just basketball.
It's school, this town, everything.

83
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,276
I like Beacontown.

84
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,468
I'd like my life to change. I don't
wanna end up working for my dad.

85
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,397
- You're father is a terrific guy.
- Boof, look at me.

86
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,790
Now try and be objective.

87
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,112
Am I all right?
Is there anything wrong with me?

88
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,590
- You should shower after basketball.
- I do.

89
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,320
Then there's nothing wrong with you.

90
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,870
Then why won't Pamela Wells
say two words to me?

91
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,635
- You can do a lot better than her.
- Like who?

92
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,588
- Don't you have to be at work?
- Did I say something wrong?

93
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,990
No, no. See you at the party.

94
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,759
- Hey, Angela.
- What was the score?

95
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,876
Very funny.

96
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,429
What was the score?
Don't tell me, I'll lose my count.

97
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,272
Down to our last waffle iron.

98
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,910
How am I expected to compete
with wrenches made in India?

99
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,799
I'm not Sears and Roebuck.

100
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,397
You look a little tired today.
The coach isn't giving you steroids, is he?

101
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,236
Not likely. Maybe he should.
We lost 71-12.

102
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,791
Beacontown hasn't won a game in...
It must be three years.

103
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,234
Ow!

104
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,791
Don't take it personally.
It's all part of growing up.

105
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,032
Yeah, I guess so.

106
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,352
- Any deliveries?
- Down at the high school.

107
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,991
Some strange sounding guy called.
Sounded like he was in a hurry.

108
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,551
I'm not sure what I wrote down.
That's what the clipboard is for.

109
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,631
Well, it is.

110
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,030
It's broken.

111
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,317
A dog whistle?

112
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,555
Hi, Mr. Thorne. How are you, sir?

113
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,074
Thank s.

114
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,355
What an arm.
Thank s, Mr. Thorne. I appreciate it.

115
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,710
I knew he was out there.

116
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,873
I didn't actually hear him,
but I knew he was there.

117
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,068
I could only see a thin white crack
of light which set my bedroom apart...

118
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,233
More sensual. We need to
feel you, want to smell you. Hurt me.

119
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,470
...from the dense and heavy darkness.

120
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,315
But surely I could feel him.
It was Nick.

121
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,354
What was that?

122
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,750
Sorry, sir. That was me.

123
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,074
What do you want from me?
What do people want from me?

124
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,109
- I am merely trying to rehearse.
- I'm sorry.

125
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,999
I've got the stuff that you ordered.

126
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,517
- Are you from the hardware store?
- Yeah.

127
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,868
Pamela? Excuse me.
Are you going to the party tonight?

128
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,158
- I'd like to give you a ride.
- The paint. My paint.

129
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,754
A can of cocoa, a can of mauve.
Am I right?

130
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,559
Right.

131
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,712
- Kirk, how was my reading?
- Beautiful, darling.

132
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,633
Very sensual. I'm still in pain.
Thank you.

133
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:18,035
You're welcome. Listen, about tonight...
I'm serious. I'd like to take you.

134
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,430
I've got a van.

135
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,592
Hope your acting's better
than your hook shot, boy.

136
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,193
I already have a ride.

137
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,591
Or maybe you were just acting
like a basketball player.

138
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,637
He just delivers hardware, Mick.

139
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,951
Maybe he should get back
to delivering it. Come on.

140
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,751
I said mauve. Not turquoise!

141
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,354
Mr. Lolley?

142
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,308
- The boss says I'm to pick up a keg.
- Is that right?

143
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,074
- The boss called you, right?
- Can't say he did.

144
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,236
Hot damn. The boss is throwing a bash
for one of the boys at the gravel pit.

145
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,470
He just got paroled.

146
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,309
Well, I've got plenty of bread.

147
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,193
Here. There's a little extra for you.

148
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,432
Got to see your ID... sport.

149
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,914
- I don't even like beer.
- Never... say... die.

150
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,632
Dad?

151
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,869
What would you say
if I wanted to quit the team?

152
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,190
- Quit the team?
- Yeah.

153
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,670
That's pretty drastic.
You're not the worst player they've got.

154
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:26,356
Your mother always said
you could do anything you wanted to.

155
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,513
- I was thinking of doing something else.
- Like what?

156
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,511
School play.

157
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,990
Theatre has its place, I suppose,

158
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,549
but what about
your commitment to the team?

159
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:45,512
Dad, has anything ever happened to you
that was so weird...

160
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,514
- Maybe we should have a chat.
- How's the king of nuts and bolts?

161
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,389
- Stiles, nice shirt.
- Thank s. Come on, we're late.

162
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,917
- Boof going with you?
- I don't know how she's getting there.

163
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,719
- Is this OK?
- Don't worry, I'll get it.

164
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,996
Have a good time. Be careful.

165
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,798
- Come on.
- Hey, listen. Stiles.

166
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,350
- Is there a rash going around?
- Why, you wanna catch one?

167
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,751
- I'm serious.
- No...

168
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,549
...but I heard Mr. Murphy,
the shop teacher...

169
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,598
...got his dick caught
in a vacuum cleaner.

170
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,077
Forget I asked.

171
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,318
- Stiles, you're crazy.
- No, not crazy. It's perfect.

172
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,472
Now you just stick this in your pocket like this.

173
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,837
You don't say anything except
"Give me a keg, buddy. "

174
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,037
Pay for it so he can't say you robbed him.

175
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:55,354
You know I'd do this myself,
but that old guy already kicked me out.

176
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,915
Give me the gun.
Give me the money.

177
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,677
- I'm gonna try and buy it. That's it.
- He's a ball buster and it won't work.

178
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,035
- It won't work.
- That's it.

179
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,558
Damn...

180
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,509
Never say...

181
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,159
...die.

182
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:30,954
No, not that. No, I think I'll leave it.
No, thanks a lot anyway. Bye.

183
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:37,275
Do you have any more of that liqueur?
My sister really liked that.

184
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,476
Yes, thank you.

185
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,355
Hey, Debbie, are you coming?

186
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,793
Hi.

187
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,954
Hi.

188
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:58,558
- I'd like a keg of beer, please.
- You don't say.

189
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,952
- Yeah, how much is that?
- Do you have any ID, sonny?

190
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,953
You little bastards
just won't give up, will you?

191
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,908
No ID, no goddamn beer. Can't you
get that through your thick skull?

192
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,394
Give me a keg of beer.

193
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,038
And these.

194
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,872
# Finding my way

195
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,112
# Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah

196
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:49,398
- What did you say to that guy?
- Just, "Give me a keg. "

197
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,438
- That's it?
- Yeah, that's it.

198
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,278
Well, Lewis. This is it.
Tonight's the night.

199
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,910
- Pamela is gonna be there and so am I.
- So is Mick.

200
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,548
- He won't be there.
- They're going together.

201
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,474
- They're not going together.
- Mick is like 20 years old.

202
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,430
He's still in high school
because he did time in jail.

203
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,750
- Forget Pamela Wells.
- They're not going together.

204
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,751
He's a total psycho.

205
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,639
Why don't you go for Boof?
She likes you.

206
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,954
- You sound like my dad.
- Pull over.

207
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,156
Trust me. We've got to stick together.

208
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,108
I'm not even listening anymore.

209
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,431
- Once and for all they're not going out.
- Yeah, they are.

210
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,875
- Not. You're mistaken.
- You're crazy.

211
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,759
- Lewis, take my wheels.
- I don't have my license yet.

212
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,478
Just do it.

213
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,871
Let's just go to the party.
This isn't a good idea.

214
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,598
Surf's up.

215
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,790
- Drive in front of us.
- Not too close.

216
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,839
- What are you gonna do?
- Will you just do it?

217
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,438
Kids.

218
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,478
- I'm gonna go slow, all right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

219
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,235
Don't worry.
We've got everything under control.

220
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,599
You do your thing and I will do mine.
Cowabunga!

221
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,515
What?

222
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,430
Whoa!

223
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,113
Ahh!

224
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,872
Wow!

225
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,396
- Wipe-out!
- You all right up there?

226
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,439
Yeah, no sweat.
But just watch those waves.

227
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,639
Hello, everybody. I have arrived.

228
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,112
You look great.

229
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,792
Yeah, nice hit, baby.

230
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,838
- You are a cheese ball.
- That's my middle name.

231
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,231
- You'd never catch me up there.
- You'd be the king of urban surfing.

232
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,676
No way, Louie. That's my baby.
Give me that.

233
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,399
Hi.

234
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,758
- Looking for someone in particular?
- Not you.

235
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,515
There you go.
She said two words to you.

236
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,673
Just like I said. No dry throats tonight.
Did I come through or what?

237
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,197
OK, put it down over there.
If we don't get to it, take it home.

238
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:33,909
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24,

239
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,950
25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30!

240
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,196
That's it.

241
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,155
You got some kind of rash?

242
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,878
Matchmaker lady, the hat. All right.

243
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,552
Next up is... Whoa, help me Rhonda!

244
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:16,274
- What do I have to do?
- Read the name on the paper.

245
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,317
It says, "Chubby".

246
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,469
Matchmaker lady.

247
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,879
All right.

248
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,468
All right, Chubby, baby.

249
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,270
You have to eat
this whole bowl of Jell-O.

250
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,558
- What do I have to do?
- Hold the Jell-O.

251
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,949
All right, next up is...

252
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,033
...Boof!

253
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,475
It's... Scott.

254
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,229
- Booferino gets the Howard boy.
- I don't know if this is a good idea.

255
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,030
You're gonna love it.
In fact, it's the grand prize.

256
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:47,629
Two minutes. Anything goes, baby.
And don't disappoint us.

257
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,389
- It's kinda funny that you got me.
- I lied. I got Malcolm.

258
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,391
Malcolm's a good guy.

259
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,989
You can come a little closer.
I promise I won't bite.

260
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,878
Go, go, go...

261
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,516
Take this cup to Thorne's house,
tell him you're from the Board of Health

262
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,877
and you want to check his... blood sugar.

263
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:53,757
- Boof, I feel kind of weird.
- How do I feel?

264
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,109
- What is this?
- You gotta see this.

265
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,669
See what? I don't see anything.
Come on.

266
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,953
Aren't you getting a little bit rough?

267
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,638
Hey, your fingernails!

268
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,030
It's awful quiet in there.

269
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,156
Oooh!

270
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:47,118
Do you guys think they're dead?
There's only one way to find out.

271
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,235
So, tell us.
What's it like coming out of the closet?

272
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,633
It was unexpected.

273
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,833
Scott?

274
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,917
Scott?

275
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,516
Ahh!

276
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,990
Jeez Louise.

277
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:09,278
- Scott? Can I come in?
- No, Dad.

278
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,595
No, I'm doing something in here. I'll say.

279
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,311
You may be surprised. Whatever it is,
you can tell me. I'll understand.

280
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,230
No, Dad. No, not this time.

281
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:31,876
Scott Howard, this is your father.
Now open this door right this minute.

282
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,837
OK, Dad.

283
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,391
You asked for it.

284
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,112
An explanation is probably long overdue.

285
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:04,628
An explanation? Jesus Christ, Dad!
An explanation? Look at me.

286
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,916
- Look at you.
- It's not as bad as it look s.

287
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,275
Wait a minute, Dad.

288
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,275
You mean you knew about this
and you didn't tell me?

289
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,991
I was hoping I wouldn't have to.
Sometimes it skips a generation.

290
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:23,438
- I was hoping it would pass you by.
- Well, it didn't pass me by.

291
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,515
It landed on my face.
What the hell am I gonna do?

292
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:40,589
- We really need to talk about this.
- Forget it. I don't wanna talk. Go away.

293
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,996
- Tough night, huh?
- Yeah, you could say that.

294
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,436
And there was a full moon last night.

295
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:24,277
I meant to talk to you about that last evening,
but you were kind of upset.

296
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:30,591
Here's a nice hot cup of cocoa.
Look s like you can use it.

297
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,876
That'll help.

298
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:38,637
Look Scott, being what we are
is not without its problems,

299
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,712
- but it's not all bad either.
- Tell me about it.

300
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,599
You can do things the other guys can't.

301
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,639
Oh, like chase cars and bite the mail man?

302
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,554
When you want it,
you're gonna have great power.

303
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,996
And with great power
goes a greater responsibility.

304
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,472
- Your mom and I learned to live with it.
- And what if can't?

305
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,633
I can look forward to stealing babies
in the middle of the night.

306
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,234
And killing chickens.

307
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,234
Fearing full moons, dodging
silver bullets. Well, no thank s.

308
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:16,599
Don't believe all that stuff.
With certain obvious exceptions

309
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,035
werewolves are people like anyone else.

310
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,276
What I'm trying to say is

311
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,274
the werewolf is a part of you,
but that doesn't change the inside.

312
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,115
Look, I've got a bad outside hook shot.
I'm allergic to eggs.

313
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,909
I've got a six dollar haircut.
I mean, I have problems.

314
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,798
I don't need this one.

315
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,076
I gotta get to school.

316
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,272
That went well.

317
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,798
- Hello.
- Hi.

318
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,271
- There's something different about you.
- That's nice.

319
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,590
Did you change your hair?

320
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,235
Missed you at lunch today, Scott.

321
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,439
Oh, yeah. Hi, Boof. Sorry, I forgot.

322
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:29,630
Well, I have to go study my lines.
Kirk... Mr. Lolley... he's so demanding.

323
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,877
- Bye.
- Bye.

324
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,315
How's it going, Stiles?

325
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:53,479
The twins surely would have died
if they hadn't been saved by a... what?

326
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,029
- A miracle?
- Yes, I suppose.

327
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:01,752
But what form did this particular
miracle take? Scott Howard?

328
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,750
Very amusing Scott, but you are correct.

329
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,469
The infants were saved
and suckled by a wolf.

330
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,030
A she wolf. Wolf, wolf, wolf.

331
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,235
Wolfe!

332
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,312
Ahh!... tishoo.

333
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,677
Thomas Wolfe. Don't you people
read what I assign you?

334
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:36,109
"Look Homeward Angel".
Scott, it's a book. By Thomas Wolfe.

335
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,193
- Wolfe. Wolfe.
- Scott.

336
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,872
Come on, Scott.
It's a lot simpler than it look s.

337
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,150
OK.

338
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,795
Just try, Scott.

339
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,950
It's wet. You can't go in.

340
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,316
That's wet, too!

341
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:18,069
Don't change, don't change.
Stay calm, stay calm.

342
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,751
- Little far from you side, aren't you?
- No.

343
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,595
I mean, yes, sir, but the halls were wet.

344
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,830
- Let me see your hands.
- Sir.

345
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,072
Let me see your hands now.

346
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,234
You don't have a marker on you,
do you?

347
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,357
No. No, sir.

348
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,830
I've got my eyes on you
and if you ever get out of line...

349
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,152
Yeah, I gotta go.

350
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:28,071
- What are you doing?
- Big brother keeps an emergency stash.

351
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:33,439
I got to talk to you about something,
because it's making me nuts.

352
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,559
If it's that intense,
I'll need a solid buzz to think clearly.

353
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:45,479
Look, I wouldn't even mention it to you,
but I got to talk to someone.

354
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:51,397
If you're gonna tell me you're a fag,
I don't think I can handle it.

355
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,120
I'm not a fag.

356
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,316
I'm... a werewolf.

357
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,633
Where would that scumbag keep it?

358
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,039
Scott.

359
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,238
- Scottie?
- Stiles, it's me.

360
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,752
What do you think?

361
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,916
Can you do that any time you want?

362
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,514
I guess so. I mean, I just did.

363
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,229
But sometimes it happens
when I don't want it to.

364
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,277
What can I say?

365
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,634
You're beautiful.

366
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:01,875
Hey, what can a teen wolf do?

367
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:07,114
- I can smell what you're looking for.
- The stash?

368
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,517
Oh no, I checked there.

369
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:25,358
Stiles, this is just between you and me, OK?

370
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,431
Yeah, yeah. TW.

371
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,633
Look at you.

372
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,793
You're gonna be glad you came to me,
because with the right angles

373
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,078
we're gonna turn this into something...
monstrous.

374
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:44,471
Stiles. Stiles.

375
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,391
Go ahead. Shoot it, shoot it.

376
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,679
No way, no way.
Don't foul me now. Here we go.

377
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,153
Yeah!

378
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,918
- Hi, Scott.
- Hi.

379
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:09,073
Boof came over for a little one on one.
She's killing me.

380
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,549
What? What's so funny?

381
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,397
- We were just chatting. Do you mind?
- No, why should I mind?

382
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:23,031
Well, I gotta get going.
Would you like to walk me home?

383
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:28,276
- Boof, I just got here.
- Scott.

384
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,955
- Yeah.
- Thank s for everything.

385
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:35,157
- You better work on that jumpshot.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

386
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,676
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.

387
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,113
Ha!

388
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,592
Get in!

389
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:59,033
So, you guys were chatting.
Harold Howard and his famous chats.

390
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,553
What did he say?

391
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,429
He mentioned you were thinking
of quitting basketball

392
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,672
- to work on a school play.
- Yeah.

393
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,753
I can see why. She's very pretty, Scott.

394
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:17,153
But she has a boyfriend.
A very large boyfriend.

395
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:21,836
The way things are going now
I should just stay away from everyone.

396
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,275
Even me?

397
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,715
I couldn't get rid of you if I tried.

398
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,868
- What?
- Do you remember?

399
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,190
- How old were we? Six?
- Five.

400
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,670
I wanted to run away,
but you wouldn't let me go alone.

401
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,196
- I thought you'd get lost.
- We just walked around the block

402
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,033
because our parents
wouldn't let us cross the street.

403
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:49,115
- I thought they were gonna kill us.
- But nobody even knew we were gone.

404
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,511
Did you ever tell anybody?
Me neither.

405
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,558
Scott, if you ever
need someone to talk to,

406
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,474
if something is bothering you,
I'll understand.

407
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,913
Not this time, Boof.
You won't understand.

408
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:18,198
- I've gotta go.
- Yeah, bye.

409
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,159
OK, now here's the drill.
Play 'em man for man.

410
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,756
- You know who you've got.
- Hey baby, ten hut. Nice haircut.

411
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:51,074
"Be all that you can be. " What is this?
Is the president here or something?

412
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:56,148
- Good luck, Scott.
- Thank s. Thank you.

413
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,113
It'll all be over in less than an hour.

414
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,475
Any strategy against Meechum, coach?

415
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,791
You guys are great.
You got nothing to be ashamed of.

416
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,872
Go out there and give 'em hell.

417
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,279
That's a foul. Let's go.

418
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,870
Come on, set it up.

419
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,759
Up to the line, Scottie. You can do it.

420
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,799
Ahh!

421
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,476
Go and get me some salt. Salt.

422
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,111
Flick the ball back to him.

423
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,238
Go, Scottie.

424
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,672
Easy, easy.

425
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,558
Come on. Let's go.

426
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,635
Come on.

427
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,916
- All right, guys.
- Let's play a little ball here.

428
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,239
- Hey Scott, did the coach know?
- Hey, I didn't know.

429
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:32,594
- How do you feel?
- He feels... like a winner!

430
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,757
- Boof, did you know?
- Are you kidding?

431
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,510
On the house, sonny.

432
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,234
Hey, Lewis.

433
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:54,391
- Whoa, Mr. T.
- You may think you're special,

434
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,836
but let me remind you
that I'm still the vice-principal.

435
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,470
Hey, I'm no different than anyone else.

436
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,952
That's nice. You look good in that.

437
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:56,232
- Well, Scott Howard.
- Hey, Boof.

438
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,470
Aren't you afraid you'll
disappoint your fans?

439
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,359
I can't help
that the town is wolf crazy.

440
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,034
This wasn't my idea.

441
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,395
- There are some advantages.
- None.

442
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,757
All sizes. No waiting, everybody.
Check it out. Right here.

443
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,037
Hey Scotto, tip of the iceberg, baby.
We are cleaning up.

444
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,555
Boof, I've got something for you.

445
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,757
Here we go. Check it out.
All sizes. No waiting.

446
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,753
- Elegant.
- Scott.

447
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,311
Listen to this.
Kirk wants you to be in the play.

448
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,313
He does? Wait a minute.
What about basketball?

449
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:33,758
It won't interfere.
It's a small part. Just for you.

450
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,993
Here, Pamela. This is for you.
It's too big for me.

451
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,118
There are some advantages, Scott.
Admit it.

452
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,870
You can murder my family.
You can ravish my body.

453
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:57,352
But I beg you
with all that is decent and holy,

454
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,318
don't destroy my plantation.

455
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,117
Sergeant, burn the fields.

456
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,795
And when you're done with that,
burn the house.

457
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,275
Yeah...

458
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,989
Wolf... wolf... wolf person.
Whatever your name is.

459
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,232
- That was really...
- Thank s, babe, I love you.

460
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,230
...something.

461
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,431
Come in.

462
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:32,272
- Hi.
- Close the door, please.

463
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,158
Yeah.

464
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:46,312
Relax. We're just
one big happy family in the theatre.

465
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,158
Yeah.

466
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,870
What happened to the wolf?

467
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:00,670
Can you just change back and forth
whenever you feel like it?

468
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:06,836
Sure. Sometimes I have to get
kind of worked up to be the wolf,

469
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,673
but it's not too hard.

470
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:13,071
What do you think about
to get worked up?

471
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:16,994
Different things.

472
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:24,518
Wolves aren't supposed to be shy.

473
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:31,474
Pamela, what are you doing?

474
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,717
You are an animal.

475
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,035
Strike.

476
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,509
Five in a row.

477
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,552
OK...

478
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,440
Did you know he was gonna be here?

479
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:24,672
We had such a nice day today.
Don't spoil it.

480
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,315
OK, you got it.

481
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:35,678
Nice. Good. OK.
Good form. Nice approach.

482
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:45,159
- Oh, poo.
- Boy, that was nice and warm.

483
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:52,115
OK, address the ball.

484
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:57,912
Tuck in your tummy.
That's good. OK.

485
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,150
Here we go. Are you ready?

486
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,949
Hey, that's my girl.
Don't touch her again.

487
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:08,591
- She's my date tonight, pal.
- You don't scare me, freak.

488
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:12,679
Underneath all that hair
you're still a dork, Scott.

489
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:18,078
I've handled your kind before.
Your mom used to steal chickens.

490
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,357
Till I blew her head off with a shotgun.
Right, Scott?

491
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:40,192
So, does Mick always act like that?

492
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:43,352
You can hardly blame him.
He is my boyfriend.

493
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,195
- You mean was your boyfriend.
- Is my boyfriend.

494
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:52,309
- But what about us?
- What about us?

495
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:58,919
- This afternoon in your dressing room.
- Yeah?

496
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,834
Yeah... Well, you see
the spring dance is coming up...

497
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,073
And I already told you
I'm going to the dance with Mick.

498
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,357
- Hey, Chubaroo, nice game, guy.
- Yeah.

499
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:57,673
- At least we're winning.
- He is. When do we get the ball?

500
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,877
What good is the championship
if we don't get to play?

501
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,032
It's not how you play,
it's whether you win or lose.

502
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:08,113
- And even that's not important.
- How about a celebration?

503
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:12,068
- Chubby, ice cream sundae?
- I'm on a diet, remember?

504
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,838
Brad, glass of milk?

505
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,188
I don't get it. What's their problem?

506
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:22,591
Let me give you some advice.
I have three rules

507
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:27,675
Get 12 hours of sleep, don't play cards
with a guy whose name is also a city

508
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:31,150
and avoid ladies with dagger tattoos.

509
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:34,949
Stick with that
and everything else is cream cheese.

510
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,350
Great game there, Scottie.

511
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:41,357
Thank s, coach.

512
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,150
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

513
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,792
Stiles?

514
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:59,188
- Where did you get this?
- We traded in the Nova. Even swap.

515
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:03,876
- How much extra did you pay for this?
- Even swap.

516
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:09,672
For certain considerations.
Lookey here!

517
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,479
- Stiles.
- Hey, surf's up?

518
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:17,156
Yeah, surf is definitely up.
Let's go pick up Lewis, OK?

519
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:23,156
What? What is it with Lewis?
He's avoiding me, right?

520
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,276
He's scared of me.

521
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:33,752
We've got fine wheels, good tunes
and a total disregard for public safety.

522
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,115
You're right. OK, let's go. Surf's up.

523
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,998
Wait a minute.

524
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,355
These waves are mine.

525
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,396
Unbelievable!

526
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,476
You know what?
You look great up there!

527
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,959
Missed you at the hardware store.

528
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:03,719
- Sorry. I was with Stiles this afternoon.
- I know.

529
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,233
- You saw?
- Yeah, I saw.

530
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:13,997
Unless that was another werewolf
doing a handstand on Stiles' wolfmobile.

531
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,515
Look, Dad.

532
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:21,717
I'm trying to get a grip on this. I really am.

533
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:26,829
- Is Thorne still on your back?
- Yeah, Thorne...

534
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,390
...some Neanderthal named Mick
and the entire basketball team.

535
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,597
You've dug your own hole
with those fellows, but...

536
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,796
...this Thorne business is my fault.

537
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:39,878
What do you mean your fault?

538
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:41,917
It goes back a few years.

539
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:45,789
As you know, I loved your mother
since we were kids.

540
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:48,190
We were meant for each other.

541
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:51,670
But for some reason Rusty
Thorne set his cap for her too.

542
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,877
No matter what we tried,
he wouldn't go away.

543
01:01:55,040 --> 01:02:00,068
- One night, things got physical and...
- And you turned into the werewolf.

544
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:05,030
Out of anger, Scott.
I turned into the werewolf out of anger.

545
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:08,715
- In front of his beady, little eyes.
- Was he scared?

546
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,348
Scared?

547
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:16,548
- He lost control of his bodily functions.
- I wish I could have seen that.

548
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:20,872
It wasn't a very nice thing to do.
But it worked.

549
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:23,634
After that he never
bothered your mother or me.

550
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:29,670
But to this day, I don't know
who was the most frightened that night.

551
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:33,116
Old Rusty Thorne... or me.

552
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,760
You gotta get a hold of it, son.

553
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,348
- Morning, Daisy.
- Morning.

554
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:01,550
- Boof. What's up?
- Nothing.

555
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:07,511
Why does anything have to be up?
I thought I'd walk to school with you.

556
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:20,869
- Got any plans for the spring dance?
- Hadn't given it much thought.

557
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:25,352
I'm surprised they haven't decided
to call it "Teen Wolf Ball".

558
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:33,671
- Will you... go with me to the dance?
- I'll think about it.

559
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:39,073
- Is that a yes?
- Yes. On one condition.

560
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:42,471
- You take me to the dance.
- I thought we just established...

561
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:46,792
You, Scott Howard. Not the wolf.

562
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:53,672
No. Look, I've got to be the wolf.
That's what everyone expects.

563
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:56,798
- Is that what you want?
- Everybody likes the wolf.

564
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,111
All right, almost everybody.

565
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:05,354
You said it yourself. If I go as
Scott Howard, I'm gonna be average.

566
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,512
Why do I have to be like everybody else?

567
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:11,240
That's not a problem for you anymore.

568
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,631
And I guess
I don't have a date for the dance.

569
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:19,874
Look, Boof, I'm sorry. I can't.

570
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:26,797
Hey, listen.
You'll still dance with me, won't you?

571
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,670
Even if I'm a werewolf?

572
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:34,749
Yeah, I'll still dance with you.

573
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,275
- And feed me grapes?
- Don't push it.

574
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,668
Tickle my paws?

575
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:11,674
She's right. You are an animal.

576
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,915
There he is!

577
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,273
Oh, my God!

578
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:52,631
You look fabulous.
Absolutely gorgeous!

579
01:05:56,120 --> 01:06:00,796
Nice to see you.
Thank you, thank you... How are you doing?

580
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,111
- Hey, save me a dance?
- You'll have to ask my escort.

581
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,635
Stay away from her tonight.
I'm warning you.

582
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:09,149
Hey, Stiles.

583
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:13,108
Thank you. Thank s.

584
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,238
Hi, how are you doing?

585
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,119
Wolf, Wolf, Wolf...

586
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,033
You still wanna dance with the wolf?

587
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:32,990
- Your public wants you.
- Do you mind?

588
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:05,275
- What?
- What am I gonna do about you?

589
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:08,750
Hey, Boof, I am what I am.

590
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:14,990
All I said was
I might wanna dance with him.

591
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:20,109
You can't possibly take it seriously.
Not unless you want to have his puppies.

592
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:31,632
I want Scott for just a half hour.
I really missed him.

593
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:17,117
Stay away from Pamela. She's mine.
Stick with your own kind, freak.

594
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:19,794
Like that little tramp.

595
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,155
Mick, watch out!

596
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,597
What are you all laughing at?

597
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:35,833
- Get back here.
- You're just some kind of animal.

598
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:41,518
Come on, freak. Get back here.
Let go of me. Let go.

599
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:46,231
Get back. I'll rip your head right off.
Come on, freak.

600
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:49,597
I'm not through with you yet.
Come back, freak.

601
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:54,436
This isn't done by a long shot.
Get back in here, freak.

602
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:59,358
Come back here, freak.
We haven't settled this yet!

603
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,153
Hold it.

604
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:18,358
Now you've done it.

605
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:25,756
You don't know how long I have waited
to get you right where I have you.

606
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:33,031
You're never going to play
basketball again. You know why?

607
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:36,636
Because you're not going
to be here anymore, that's why.

608
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,439
You're out of here, Mr. Howard.
And don't you...

609
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:44,435
Thorne. Go on home, son. Go ahead.

610
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,670
I'll handle this.

611
01:10:56,080 --> 01:11:00,915
- You never learn, do you, Rusty?
- You stay away from me.

612
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:05,710
I want you to leave my son alone.

613
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:11,955
He's a good kid. He's just having
a tough time right now. OK?

614
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:27,118
I knew I could count on you, Rusty.

615
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:36,119
You can murder my family.
You can ravish my body.

616
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:40,273
But I beg you
with all that is decent and holy,

617
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:43,796
don't destroy my plantation.

618
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:50,870
- Sergeant, burn the fields...
- Hold it. Hold it, baby.

619
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,350
...down the house.
- Hold it right there, babe.

620
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,954
Listen...

621
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:01,432
...this is a full dress rehearsal.
We need to see the wolf.

622
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:05,513
So wolf out, wolf up, wolf it.
Whatever you do. <i>Pronto amigo</i>

623
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:11,277
Mr. Lolley. I've been doing
some thinking and I decided

624
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,476
I'd rather play the part as me.

625
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:18,953
- Well, play it. Play it as myself.
- That wouldn't be theatre, would it?

626
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:22,510
See, no one wants to see you.

627
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:27,839
Well, like I said, I'd rather play it like this.

628
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,120
OK, I see. How am I gonna put this to you?

629
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:37,114
Look at it this way no wolf...

630
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,714
...no part. What do you think?

631
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,790
Wow. Bummer, huh?

632
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,112
Hey, Scottie.

633
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:03,393
- I'll have Friday nights free.
- Even if you won't be the wolf,

634
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:06,597
- do you have to quit the team?
- Are you kidding?

635
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:12,392
You've seen me play basketball. I suck.
They want the wolf. I can't do it.

636
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:17,714
Wait a minute. What's going on?
What are you guys talking about?

637
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:23,079
We're talking about the wolf, Stiles. I can't
do it anymore. You saw what happened.

638
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,992
- Are you crazy?
- Maybe.

639
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:28,630
The championship is coming up
in less than four hours.

640
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:32,793
Everyone's depending on you.
Are you gonna let down your team?

641
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,076
Your school? This whole town?

642
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:39,472
What about me?
I've got a large investment going on over here.

643
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:41,198
Hey, Scott, do it for me.

644
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:45,517
I gotta go, man.

645
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:49,798
Scott, help me out. Do the right thing.

646
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:55,598
That's all I wanna do, Stiles.
That's all I wanna do.

647
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:26,235
Boo!

648
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:35,948
Chubby, get time. Come here.

649
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:37,997
See that?

650
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:41,198
Come on.

651
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:48,555
That's a purple heart, kid.

652
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:55,670
Smart basketball, Brad,
taking a charge like that.

653
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:10,352
Oh, man.

654
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:42,719
- So where's the wolf?
- Not today, coach. No wolf.

655
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:45,792
Wait until the second half.
Build up their confidence.

656
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:51,273
Look, coach, no wolf.
Not now, not ever.

657
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:55,718
I wanna play, but I gotta be myself.

658
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:59,873
OK, but we're gonna get
our brains beat in, you know.

659
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,159
- Sure you won't change your mind?
- I've had it.

660
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:12,233
- This is all your fault, Howard.
- I think we can take these guys.

661
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:18,635
- Terrific, now where's the wolf?
- No, I mean it. I think we can win.

662
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:24,272
This is the championship. It doesn't
matter how we got here. We're here.

663
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:28,718
If we're gonna win, we gotta do it
ourselves. We don't need the wolf.

664
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,910
Harold, your boy let us down.

665
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,399
You're dead.

666
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:52,314
Shoot. Shoot it.

667
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:57,995
Shoot it!

668
01:16:58,160 --> 01:16:59,798
Shoot it, fat boy.

669
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:05,388
Yeah!

670
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:20,033
- How much more can you take, freak?
- As much as you can dish out.

671
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:20,155
What's so funny, dork?

672
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:25,193
That's four fouls.
One more and you're out of there.

673
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:56,433
Come on. Make your move.

674
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,955
Come on, fat boy. Try it.

675
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,228
You gotta get back. Get back.

676
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:45,392
You got two shots.
Get back. Off the court.

677
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:07,430
- Let's blow out of here.
- Drop dead.
