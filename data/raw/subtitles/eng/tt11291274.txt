1
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:30,504
I meant to get a haircut.

2
00:00:35,812 --> 00:00:38,179
I got a present for ya', Casey.

3
00:00:46,187 --> 00:00:47,556
<i>Casey, sweetie,</i>

4
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,911
<i>you take your
daddy's present now.</i>

5
00:00:51,325 --> 00:00:52,729
Whoa.

6
00:00:59,702 --> 00:01:01,837
<i>I got a picture of you, too.</i>

7
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:10,144
Maria!

8
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,481
No! No, no! No!

9
00:01:13,514 --> 00:01:15,216
<i>Happy birthday, darlin'.</i>

10
00:01:27,461 --> 00:01:28,495
No!

11
00:01:44,845 --> 00:01:47,783
Whoa!

12
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:07,935
Thank you.

13
00:02:07,968 --> 00:02:09,379
<i>Obviously, you've seen
mankiewicz's</i> house of strangers.

14
00:02:09,403 --> 00:02:10,814
It's one of my all-time
favorite movies.

15
00:02:10,838 --> 00:02:12,679
That's exactly what your
script reminded me of.

16
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:13,842
The power struggle,

17
00:02:13,874 --> 00:02:15,576
the fight for
relevance. Yeah. Yeah.

18
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,286
And you're gonna think
this sounds a little crazy,

19
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,412
but in some ways,
it's <i>king lear.</i>

20
00:02:19,446 --> 00:02:20,682
It's <i>king lear.</i> Yeah, exactly.

21
00:02:20,715 --> 00:02:22,315
See, I knew you'd understand

22
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:23,493
what I'm trying
to do with this film.

23
00:02:23,517 --> 00:02:24,986
Right.

24
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,521
David, I don't know
what to say exactly,

25
00:02:27,554 --> 00:02:29,390
except this is the
role of a lifetime

26
00:02:29,422 --> 00:02:31,792
and I'd really love
to be a part of this.

27
00:02:31,826 --> 00:02:33,604
Cool, man. I'll just give you
a shout in a couple of days.

28
00:02:33,628 --> 00:02:35,763
Oh. If you're worried
about the Boston accent,

29
00:02:35,797 --> 00:02:37,297
I can do the Boston accent.

30
00:02:37,331 --> 00:02:38,542
I've been working
on it all week.

31
00:02:38,565 --> 00:02:39,968
I'm not worried, Nick.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,545
Okay, well, if you have
any other questions

33
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:43,804
or you just wanna
talk, give me a call.

34
00:02:43,838 --> 00:02:47,042
Or if you'd like me
to, uh... to read...

35
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:48,441
You don't need to read for me.

36
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:50,376
Of course not.

37
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,813
And obviously, I'm not going to.

38
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:53,682
Obviously.

39
00:02:53,714 --> 00:02:55,425
But I bet a part of you would
love to hear me read, right?

40
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:56,549
I mean, why wouldn't you?

41
00:02:56,584 --> 00:02:58,285
If I were you, I'd
want to hear it.

42
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,960
Seriously, I don't
want you to read. Okay.

43
00:02:59,987 --> 00:03:01,723
Anyway, this is
me, so I'm gonna...

44
00:03:01,756 --> 00:03:04,424
Well, you know
what? I'm gonna read.

45
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,761
"It's a foregone
conclusion, Jimmy."

46
00:03:06,795 --> 00:03:09,064
"It takes 13 milliseconds
for the human brain"

47
00:03:09,096 --> 00:03:10,898
"to send a message to the body."

48
00:03:10,932 --> 00:03:13,735
"So, by the time your bullets
hit me, my cerebral cortex"

49
00:03:13,768 --> 00:03:14,946
"will have transmitted a signal"

50
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,403
"to the 17 healthy muscles"

51
00:03:16,436 --> 00:03:18,773
"that operate
my trigger finger."

52
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:22,076
"And before your asshole
has had a chance to pucker up,"

53
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,979
"your medulla oblongata"

54
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:26,946
"will be splattered on a
fucking wall behind ya."

55
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:28,849
"And if that's the last
thing I accomplish"

56
00:03:28,883 --> 00:03:30,651
"on this beautiful green earth,"

57
00:03:30,683 --> 00:03:35,054
"well, then, ha, I say, ha,
what a way to fucking go."

58
00:03:37,758 --> 00:03:39,325
Holy shit.

59
00:03:42,462 --> 00:03:44,631
I can do another if you want.

60
00:03:49,434 --> 00:03:52,505
Damn, man!

61
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:54,741
That was good, right? Felt good.

62
00:03:54,774 --> 00:03:57,343
Mankiewicz?
Whoo-hoo! Incredible pull.

63
00:03:57,377 --> 00:03:59,411
I know. It just
popped into my head.

64
00:03:59,445 --> 00:04:01,380
Well, good. I'm happy for you.

65
00:04:01,414 --> 00:04:05,485
Because, honestly,
man, you really need this.

66
00:04:05,517 --> 00:04:07,452
What? What is that
supposed to mean?

67
00:04:07,486 --> 00:04:09,957
You get it. This could
be a game changer.

68
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,002
I don't need a game changer.
If it happens, it happens.

69
00:04:12,026 --> 00:04:13,770
If it doesn't, I'll just keep
working. That's what I do.

70
00:04:13,794 --> 00:04:16,763
I'm just saying, you could
be a little more strategic.

71
00:04:16,796 --> 00:04:18,565
Make more movie star choices.

72
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:20,532
It's like miles Davis told me...

73
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:21,611
"Sometimes, it's the notes"

74
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:22,837
"you don't play."

75
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,404
Miles Davis was a heroin addict.

76
00:04:24,436 --> 00:04:25,681
I mean, I love him,
he was a maestro,

77
00:04:25,705 --> 00:04:27,106
but I'm happy,

78
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,551
I'm healthy when I'm
working. I'm an actor.

79
00:04:28,575 --> 00:04:30,010
No, you're a fucking movie star!

80
00:04:30,044 --> 00:04:31,476
And don't you ever forget that!

81
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,089
Okay, I don't need
this. I don't need this.

82
00:04:33,113 --> 00:04:35,048
Get out of my car.
Nicky, get out of my car.

83
00:04:35,082 --> 00:04:36,717
I don't need this.

84
00:04:45,424 --> 00:04:47,426
I need this.

85
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,428
This could be a game changer.

86
00:04:49,462 --> 00:04:51,140
So, you're not happy with
how your career is going

87
00:04:51,164 --> 00:04:53,801
because you seem to
be working all the time.

88
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:57,503
Well, I never viewed it
as a career, only as work.

89
00:04:57,536 --> 00:04:58,582
And what's wrong with that?

90
00:04:58,606 --> 00:05:00,173
I mean, in any other job,

91
00:05:00,207 --> 00:05:01,674
hard work is
something to behold,

92
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:03,077
but with film performance,

93
00:05:03,109 --> 00:05:04,520
"you're making too
many movies, Nick."

94
00:05:04,544 --> 00:05:05,880
"You're working too hard, Nick."

95
00:05:05,912 --> 00:05:07,423
"Have the audience
miss you more, Nick."

96
00:05:07,447 --> 00:05:08,681
I mean, "hello, it's my job."

97
00:05:08,716 --> 00:05:09,984
"I pay my bills."

98
00:05:10,017 --> 00:05:11,685
"I feed my family.
You're annoying."

99
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:12,986
My gosh!

100
00:05:13,988 --> 00:05:15,856
Yeah.

101
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,657
So, what's the worry here, Nick?

102
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,524
You've lost some
of your ability,

103
00:05:19,558 --> 00:05:21,492
your talent as an actor?

104
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:23,663
No.

105
00:05:24,197 --> 00:05:25,564
Uh...

106
00:05:25,598 --> 00:05:27,466
No, it's just that
I really want this.

107
00:05:27,499 --> 00:05:28,800
This is the role of a lifetime.

108
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:30,737
It's a great part.

109
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:33,639
Well, how do you think your
relationship with your work

110
00:05:33,672 --> 00:05:36,042
affects your relationship
with your daughter?

111
00:05:36,074 --> 00:05:38,076
Let's bring addy
into this, shall we?

112
00:05:39,978 --> 00:05:42,215
What? Oh, you
don't have to do that.

113
00:05:42,247 --> 00:05:43,682
You guys can keep talking.

114
00:05:43,716 --> 00:05:45,018
Well, I'll just finish with,

115
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,526
a role like this doesn't
come along every day.

116
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,720
And now, I'm gonna zip it.

117
00:05:47,754 --> 00:05:48,864
- I zipped it good.
- Addy.

118
00:05:48,888 --> 00:05:51,023
How do you think
your dad's anxiety

119
00:05:51,057 --> 00:05:52,725
over his career
has affected you?

120
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,226
Well, his career is pretty much

121
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:55,795
the only thing we talk about.

122
00:05:55,827 --> 00:05:57,663
That or he makes
me watch old movies,

123
00:05:57,697 --> 00:05:59,231
and then discuss them.

124
00:05:59,264 --> 00:06:01,800
Which is really just him
lecturing me for two hours.

125
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:04,569
It's a conversation. It's
more of a conversation.

126
00:06:04,603 --> 00:06:07,538
He made me watch
this bizarre old movie.

127
00:06:07,572 --> 00:06:10,209
What was it called? The
island of Dr. Calamari?

128
00:06:10,242 --> 00:06:13,211
<i>The cabinet of Dr. Caligari.</i>
And did you like it, addy?

129
00:06:13,245 --> 00:06:15,547
It's one of my favorite
films. Have you seen it?

130
00:06:15,581 --> 00:06:16,749
No, I have not.

131
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:19,218
It's about this
insane old doctor

132
00:06:19,252 --> 00:06:22,487
who has a sleepwalker
completely under his spell.

133
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:24,857
This crazy old loon.

134
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:28,795
Can you imagine how
horrifying that would be?

135
00:06:28,827 --> 00:06:30,004
To be completely
under someone's spell?

136
00:06:30,028 --> 00:06:31,898
And you liked it, right?

137
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,709
I mean, you like the painted
sets, and the makeup...

138
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:35,000
No, I did not.

139
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:36,201
Sounds to me like

140
00:06:36,235 --> 00:06:38,170
maybe she didn't
want to see the movie.

141
00:06:38,204 --> 00:06:39,605
Did you think about that, Nick?

142
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,973
About what she wants?

143
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:42,942
Cheryl, come on. Is
that a real question?

144
00:06:42,975 --> 00:06:45,110
What do you think
he's gonna say?

145
00:06:45,144 --> 00:06:49,014
She has an amazing visual
sensibility. Always has.

146
00:06:49,047 --> 00:06:50,692
We're very close, and
within that closeness,

147
00:06:50,716 --> 00:06:52,617
I was able to ascertain...

148
00:06:57,223 --> 00:06:58,257
Hey, honey. Hi, mom.

149
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,593
Bye, addy. I love you.

150
00:07:02,894 --> 00:07:04,297
Oh, no, what happened?

151
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:06,298
Oh, she's mad at me
because we watched.

152
00:07:06,331 --> 00:07:08,834
<i>Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</i>
together and she hated it,

153
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:11,803
which I find odd, given how
mature her taste normally is.

154
00:07:11,838 --> 00:07:13,605
Wait, you're surprised
your teenage daughter

155
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,807
didn't wanna watch an insane

156
00:07:15,841 --> 00:07:17,676
100-year-old
German film with you?

157
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,744
Yes. Oh, my god. Okay.

158
00:07:19,777 --> 00:07:21,113
Well, it's not just that.

159
00:07:21,145 --> 00:07:22,590
You know, she's never
read Mary shelley,

160
00:07:22,614 --> 00:07:24,749
or Jane Austen, or even twain.

161
00:07:24,782 --> 00:07:27,885
What a little philistine.
Should we disown her?

162
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,022
She thought Humphrey
bogart was a porn star.

163
00:07:30,054 --> 00:07:31,323
Yeah...

164
00:07:31,356 --> 00:07:33,859
What, really? Yeah.

165
00:07:33,892 --> 00:07:36,061
That's disappointing.

166
00:07:36,094 --> 00:07:38,662
Unless there is a porn star
called Humphrey bogart.

167
00:07:38,696 --> 00:07:40,931
That would work, wouldn't
it? Humphrey. Hump.

168
00:07:41,732 --> 00:07:43,602
No?

169
00:07:43,635 --> 00:07:45,102
Look, you're just...

170
00:07:45,137 --> 00:07:47,004
You're at a tricky
stage right now

171
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,306
with her, okay?

172
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,775
And if you don't
learn to connect,

173
00:07:49,808 --> 00:07:51,042
it's gonna stay broken for...

174
00:07:51,075 --> 00:07:53,210
What the fuck are
you smiling at? Huh?

175
00:07:53,244 --> 00:07:54,613
Why are you smiling? I'm not.

176
00:07:54,645 --> 00:07:55,980
You are. Okay.

177
00:07:56,013 --> 00:07:57,058
Olivia, I'm up for a
very exciting movie.

178
00:07:57,082 --> 00:07:58,849
And I think it's gonna happen.

179
00:07:58,883 --> 00:08:00,328
Oh, my god. Look, will
you do me a favor? Yes.

180
00:08:00,352 --> 00:08:01,820
Turn up for her birthday party.

181
00:08:01,852 --> 00:08:03,621
Of course. Of course.

182
00:08:03,655 --> 00:08:04,989
Gosh!

183
00:08:05,022 --> 00:08:07,159
Hey, fink, let's meet up.
I have some questions.

184
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:09,027
I don't know. I just
really want this.

185
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:11,763
I mean, this is the role of a
lifetime, and as my agent...

186
00:08:11,796 --> 00:08:15,099
Nick, I've got a
good feeling, okay?

187
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:16,934
Okay. Now, come on.

188
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:18,970
I know how tense you get.

189
00:08:19,003 --> 00:08:21,172
This is going to help you relax.

190
00:08:21,907 --> 00:08:23,140
Fuck!

191
00:08:23,174 --> 00:08:25,210
Oh, my! Fuck, I
love this so much.

192
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:29,381
Is this supposed to
hurt this much? Fuck!

193
00:08:29,414 --> 00:08:31,316
It is. The more pain the better.

194
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:32,917
Fuckin'...

195
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,387
Why? It's good for circulation.

196
00:08:43,728 --> 00:08:45,897
So, Nick, we got another offer.

197
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:46,972
Just came in this morning.

198
00:08:46,998 --> 00:08:48,834
Excellent. What's it about?

199
00:08:48,867 --> 00:08:51,268
It's about a million bucks.

200
00:08:51,302 --> 00:08:53,839
What is it?

201
00:08:53,872 --> 00:08:55,272
A birthday party, fink?

202
00:08:55,306 --> 00:08:57,175
What are you even talking about?

203
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:58,676
You go, and I don't know,

204
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,987
tell some stories,
make 'em laugh.

205
00:09:00,011 --> 00:09:02,114
Make 'em laugh? Like...
Like a circus clown?

206
00:09:02,147 --> 00:09:03,647
A trained seal?

207
00:09:07,952 --> 00:09:10,254
Nick, I got a call from your
business manager, Kenny.

208
00:09:10,287 --> 00:09:12,399
You've been living at the
sunset tower for over a year.

209
00:09:12,423 --> 00:09:14,925
And so? They love
having me there.

210
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,695
You owe them $600,000.

211
00:09:17,728 --> 00:09:19,195
They sent the bills to Kenny.

212
00:09:20,231 --> 00:09:21,831
I'll take care of it.

213
00:09:21,866 --> 00:09:24,135
Kenny says you still
have substantial debts.

214
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:26,871
And now, the divorce,
and your spending habits

215
00:09:26,903 --> 00:09:28,939
and, and, and...
Okay, I'm gonna deal

216
00:09:28,973 --> 00:09:30,741
with all that, fink.

217
00:09:30,773 --> 00:09:33,042
You know I will.

218
00:09:33,076 --> 00:09:35,179
But I'm gonna get this next role

219
00:09:35,212 --> 00:09:38,214
and when I do,
all of that changes.

220
00:09:38,983 --> 00:09:41,385
Then, I'm back.

221
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:44,688
And, by the way, not
that I went anywhere.

222
00:09:44,722 --> 00:09:46,223
Not that you went anywhere.

223
00:09:46,257 --> 00:09:47,690
You never shit on yourself.

224
00:09:47,724 --> 00:09:50,393
Come on! Never shit on yourself.

225
00:10:04,074 --> 00:10:06,810
Fink, hold on a second.
Let me get somewhere quiet.

226
00:10:08,344 --> 00:10:10,446
Fink, you still there?
I can hear you now.

227
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,224
Did you talk to him?
<i>I talked to David.</i>

228
00:10:12,248 --> 00:10:14,350
Oh, you're here. Great. Hold on.

229
00:10:14,385 --> 00:10:15,953
Right, we're doing cake.

230
00:10:15,986 --> 00:10:17,720
Uh... oh, my
god, you're doing...

231
00:10:17,754 --> 00:10:18,955
I have to finish this call.

232
00:10:18,988 --> 00:10:21,858
Oh, my god! Jesus Christ!

233
00:10:21,892 --> 00:10:22,926
Come on!

234
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,728
Fink, did you talk to him?

235
00:10:25,762 --> 00:10:27,031
<i>Nick, can you hear me?</i>

236
00:10:27,064 --> 00:10:29,767
Yes, I can hear you.
What did he say?

237
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,435
<i>He said he loves you,</i>

238
00:10:31,468 --> 00:10:33,938
<i>but he ultimately went
in a different direction</i>

239
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,439
<i>for the role.</i>

240
00:10:35,472 --> 00:10:36,906
<i>Sorry, dude.</i>

241
00:10:58,262 --> 00:10:59,762
I hate it.

242
00:11:01,565 --> 00:11:02,900
Thank you, mom.

243
00:11:07,871 --> 00:11:08,906
Thank you.

244
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:14,077
Thank you.

245
00:11:15,111 --> 00:11:17,079
Blow, blow. Make a wish.

246
00:11:19,314 --> 00:11:22,285
Happy birthday, addy!
All right, everybody!

247
00:11:22,318 --> 00:11:26,155
Gather round the piano.
It's showtime, folks.

248
00:11:26,189 --> 00:11:27,366
- What's he doing?
- What?

249
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,992
Nick? Nick?

250
00:11:29,025 --> 00:11:30,760
Uh, step away
from the piano, Nick.

251
00:11:31,461 --> 00:11:33,295
Hi, Lewis.

252
00:11:33,328 --> 00:11:35,330
You're all grown up now.

253
00:11:35,365 --> 00:11:37,165
What, are you...
What, are you 15?

254
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:38,233
Dad, don't talk to Lewis.

255
00:11:38,267 --> 00:11:39,836
Okay.

256
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:41,838
When she was nine years old,

257
00:11:41,871 --> 00:11:45,107
my daughter and I took
our first trip together.

258
00:11:45,141 --> 00:11:47,276
We drove overnight,

259
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:50,012
across the desert,
to the Grand Canyon.

260
00:11:50,045 --> 00:11:51,347
You remember that, sweetheart?

261
00:11:51,381 --> 00:11:53,016
I do remember that.

262
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:56,218
And when the sun came up,

263
00:11:56,251 --> 00:11:57,853
I pulled over to
the side of the road

264
00:11:57,886 --> 00:12:01,391
as she rested her little
head on my shoulder

265
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:03,192
and we just watched...

266
00:12:05,461 --> 00:12:07,096
Watched the sun come up.

267
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,968
That was the happiest
moment of my life.

268
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:14,304
And in that moment,

269
00:12:14,337 --> 00:12:17,406
I composed a little tune
for her 16th birthday.

270
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:19,876
I've been working
on it ever since.

271
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:24,146
And, uh, happy birthday,
sweetheart. Here goes.

272
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:45,300
Oh, fucking Jesus!

273
00:12:45,334 --> 00:12:48,170
I'm so excited to see what
you do with your life, honey.

274
00:12:48,203 --> 00:12:50,607
And I'll support
whatever you choose.

275
00:12:50,641 --> 00:12:53,876
Only, I wouldn't
recommend a life in the arts.

276
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,913
Especially, with how real
talent goes unappreciated

277
00:12:56,945 --> 00:12:58,582
in this shithole town.

278
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:11,226
I don't know, Olivia.

279
00:13:12,193 --> 00:13:13,194
I don't know.

280
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:25,273
Do you remember
when the three of us

281
00:13:25,307 --> 00:13:27,109
used to lie on the
living room floor

282
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:28,678
in the New York apartment,

283
00:13:28,711 --> 00:13:31,413
and you and I would
watch her for hours on end?

284
00:13:31,446 --> 00:13:32,947
Remember?

285
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:35,951
It was so much easier then.

286
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,085
Yeah.

287
00:13:45,193 --> 00:13:46,962
Listen.

288
00:13:46,995 --> 00:13:49,164
I'm gonna say something,
and I'm not sure I should.

289
00:13:49,197 --> 00:13:50,465
Say it.

290
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:53,501
Okay.

291
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:55,035
I need you.

292
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:56,471
You need me?

293
00:13:56,505 --> 00:14:00,008
I need you to get
your shit together, Nick.

294
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,244
Okay? She's not two
years old anymore.

295
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:05,313
She is a smart girl
who needs her dad.

296
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:06,414
She doesn't need...

297
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:09,351
She doesn't need this guy.

298
00:14:20,495 --> 00:14:21,495
Yeah.

299
00:14:51,226 --> 00:14:53,629
No, no. Come on.

300
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:16,350
<i>Nick.</i> fink.

301
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,052
The majorca thing...

302
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:19,720
<i>What? The birthday
party? So depressing.</i>

303
00:15:19,754 --> 00:15:22,288
<i>I am honestly sorry
for even bringing it up.</i>

304
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:23,389
I'll take it.

305
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,658
<i>It's gonna be great.</i>

306
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:27,260
It better be because

307
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:30,563
when it's over, I'm done.

308
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:33,267
Like hot dogs on a grill.

309
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,536
I'm quitting acting.

310
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:39,273
So, you can call the
trades, and tell them I said

311
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:42,509
it was a tremendous...

312
00:15:43,711 --> 00:15:45,580
Honor...

313
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:50,350
To be a small part

314
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:53,721
of one of the oldest
of human traditions,

315
00:15:55,456 --> 00:16:00,360
storytelling and mythmaking.

316
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:01,663
<i>Ah, fuck, man, I'm sorry.</i>

317
00:16:01,696 --> 00:16:03,406
<i>I'm driving through the
hills. One more time.</i>

318
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,566
I said I'm quitting...

319
00:16:08,536 --> 00:16:10,403
<i>Back to our main news story</i>

320
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:12,239

<i>You almost got me killed twice.</i>

329
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:26,821
Okay.

330
00:16:49,143 --> 00:16:50,744
I'm in position.

331
00:16:50,778 --> 00:16:52,446
<i>All right, as
soon as I have eyes</i>

332
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,758
<i>on baldassari, you
move in and take him.</i>

333
00:16:53,782 --> 00:16:54,783
Copy that.

334
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:00,754
Wait, wait, wait.
It's not baldassari.

335
00:17:00,788 --> 00:17:02,488
What the fuck is
happening right now?

336
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,458
Martin, talk to me.
Who's on the plane?

337
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:08,494
I don't know if
I'm losing my goddamn mind,

338
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,396
but I'm pretty sure that's
the actor Nick cage.

339
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:13,165
That motherfucker
from <i>moonstruck?</i>

340
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,767
<i>Moonstruck?</i> no. From <i>face/off.</i>

341
00:17:14,802 --> 00:17:16,569
Wait, wait, wait.

342
00:17:16,604 --> 00:17:19,137
Why the fuck is Nick
cage on this plane?

343
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:22,809
You know what?
We're pulling out.

344
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:23,887
<i>I don't like this.
Get out of there.</i>

345
00:17:23,911 --> 00:17:25,344
Martin.

346
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,646
<i>No, get out of there. Now.</i>

347
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:33,318
<i>Vivian, do you copy?
I said, do you copy?</i>

348
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:34,420
You know what?

349
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,489
No.

350
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:37,567
What do you mean,
no? No, no, no.

351
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:39,432
What are you doing?
Vivian, what are you doing?

352
00:17:39,593 --> 00:17:41,761
Thank you.

353
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:44,529
This is our shot. <i>No, get out.</i>

354
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,431
Vivian, get the fuck
out of there right...

355
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:50,903
Nicolas cage! Oh, my god!
You're so fucking awesome!

356
00:17:50,938 --> 00:17:52,773
I love you! Oh, thank you.

357
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:56,441
Oh, me and my nephew
Raymond just watched <i>croods 2.</i>

358
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:59,344
<i>Dude! Cracked us up.</i>

359
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:00,881
Can I get a selfie? Sure.

360
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,391
Oh, shit. Oh, my god.
No, I like that movie, too.

361
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,459
You did so good
in that movie, man.

362
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:04,718
Thank you. My goodness.

363
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,184
I made that movie
with Emma stone.

364
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:07,621
You did? She's
one of my favorites.

365
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:08,832
But you were the best.
Well, thank you.

366
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:10,288
We look good.

367
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:11,367
Well, say hi to
your nephew for me.

368
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:12,692
Okay. Yeah. Raymond. Okay.

369
00:18:12,726 --> 00:18:14,627
Thank you. All right, bye.

370
00:18:16,461 --> 00:18:17,964
Dropped that GPS on him.

371
00:18:17,998 --> 00:18:20,466
Are you out of your mind?
He's a fucking civilian.

372
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,869
<i>He's an actor.</i>

373
00:18:21,902 --> 00:18:23,445
Do you remember what
went down in Lisbon?

374
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,805
Fuck Lisbon, man!

375
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:27,440
That was kind of loud.

376
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:29,910
But fuck Lisbon.
That wasn't my fault.

377
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,411
And by the way,

378
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,613
have you seen <i>croods 2? No.</i>

379
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:34,212
I'm 44 years old.

380
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:35,848
Why the fuck would
I see <i>croods 2?</i>

381
00:18:35,883 --> 00:18:36,950
I'm picking you up.

382
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,701
Yeah, fink, can you hold on?

383
00:18:54,735 --> 00:18:56,646
Excuse me, it's Los Angeles
calling. I need to take this.

384
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,303
Just two minutes. Of course.

385
00:18:58,335 --> 00:19:00,372
Can you hold one second?
I'm getting on a boat.

386
00:19:00,404 --> 00:19:02,407
Thank you. Yeah.

387
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,410
I mean, what do we know
about this guy anyway?

388
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:10,347
Is he a Spanish Dr. No? Is
he into something strange?

389
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:11,759
<i>Allan did some
research. Hold on.</i>

390
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,351
<i>Allan, what does this guy do?</i>

391
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:14,953
<i>He owns olive groves apparently.</i>

392
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,889
Also, he wrote this screenplay,

393
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,791
and he wants Nick to star in it.

394
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,459
Throw that in the fucking trash.

395
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:21,861
<i>Nick, you're fine.</i>

396
00:19:21,893 --> 00:19:23,572
It's not like he's gonna
want you to suck his dick

397
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:24,730
or fuck his wife,

398
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:25,941
or watch you watch
him fuck his wife.

399
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:27,799
I wouldn't think so. <i>Relax.</i>

400
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,602
<i>Have fun and give me
a call when it's done.</i>

401
00:19:29,634 --> 00:19:30,795
You can tell me all about it.

402
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,411
Nice place.

403
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,480
Maybe I ought to get
into the olive business.

404
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,516
Mr. Cage, I... yeah,
excuse me. Real quick.

405
00:19:44,548 --> 00:19:45,861
The guy that owns this
house, what's his name?

406
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:48,286
Javi. Yeah, Javi.

407
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,023
Is Javi going to want
me to, uh, you know...

408
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,959
I'm not sure I understand.

409
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,704
Look, if Javi wants me to
suck his dick, or fuck his wife,

410
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:57,429
or watch me watch
him fuck his wife,

411
00:19:57,461 --> 00:19:58,874
that's a no-go. You
understand? It's <i>no bueno.</i>

412
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:00,732
I think so. Okay, and if Javi...

413
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:01,834
I am Javi.

414
00:20:09,674 --> 00:20:10,776
Nick cage.

415
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,581
So, how was it?

416
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:18,549
It was fine,
normal. No big deal.

417
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,719
Come on. Tell me
the truth. Okay, okay.

418
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:22,654
He was incredible. Was he?

419
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,055
But also, like, super cool.

420
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,857
He was a little taller
than I had imagined

421
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,770
because you know they
say actors are pretty short.

422
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:28,827
So, was he short?

423
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:29,996
No. No?

424
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,029
He was...

425
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,033
Just right.

426
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:36,106
Okay, but did he say anything
about your screenplay?

427
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:37,946
No. He didn't bring it
up, I didn't bring it up.

428
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:40,337
It wasn't the right time.

429
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:41,707
Just think about
how would it feel

430
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,676
to say in front of
everyone at the party

431
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:47,846
that Nicolas cage is starring
in a movie that you wrote.

432
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,047
I don't know, Gabriela,

433
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,522
maybe I am living
in a fantasy world.

434
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:51,482
I mean, look who
we're talking about here.

435
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:52,718
The man is a legend!

436
00:21:03,093 --> 00:21:04,094
Hi.

437
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,600
Hey.

438
00:21:16,106 --> 00:21:17,108
Cheers.

439
00:21:27,484 --> 00:21:28,552
Huh?

440
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:30,487
What?

441
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:31,632
Oh, no, I'm sorry,
I thought that...

442
00:21:31,656 --> 00:21:32,456
Did you say... no, I did...

443
00:21:32,488 --> 00:21:34,058
Oh, never mind.

444
00:21:37,728 --> 00:21:39,574
Yeah, so along those same
lines, I was wondering...

445
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:40,708
And it's totally
okay if you haven't,

446
00:21:40,731 --> 00:21:42,100
but I was just wondering

447
00:21:42,132 --> 00:21:43,644
if you had a chance
to read my screenplay?

448
00:21:43,668 --> 00:21:45,070
Javi!

449
00:21:45,102 --> 00:21:49,640
Can I come or it's only for vip?

450
00:21:49,673 --> 00:21:52,442
Uh, Mr. Cage, this is
Ms. Gabriela lucchesi. Hi.

451
00:21:52,476 --> 00:21:55,013
She runs all of our
agricultural operations.

452
00:21:55,045 --> 00:21:57,047
And this is my cousin.

453
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,883
Lucas Gutierrez.

454
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:02,687
Mr. Cage, we obviously are
very excited to have you here.

455
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,955
What are you working on next?

456
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:06,123
Well, that's a tough question

457
00:22:06,157 --> 00:22:08,492
for an actor to
get, but it's fine.

458
00:22:08,525 --> 00:22:11,495
Oh. 'Cause
I'm no longer an actor.

459
00:22:11,527 --> 00:22:12,863
I've retired.

460
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:16,000
What? What do you mean, retired?

461
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:18,737
So, what are you
going to do now?

462
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,007
Live the life of a house cat.

463
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,209
Because it's just
a matter of time

464
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:28,746
before the great power plant
upstairs turns off the juice

465
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:32,083
and we retreat to the
black pit of nothingness

466
00:22:32,116 --> 00:22:33,685
from whence we came.

467
00:22:37,855 --> 00:22:39,757
So, tell us about
making <i>the rock.</i>

468
00:22:41,191 --> 00:22:43,027
Bet you wish you
were still making movies

469
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:45,029
like that, huh, Mr. Cage?

470
00:22:47,098 --> 00:22:49,633
Must have been nice
to have been a star.

471
00:22:50,701 --> 00:22:51,736
And now...

472
00:23:17,861 --> 00:23:19,729
Mr. Cage? Wake up.

473
00:23:19,763 --> 00:23:21,197
Jesus Christ!

474
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,801
So, Mr. Gutierrez has been

475
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,534
waiting all day
for you to get up.

476
00:23:25,569 --> 00:23:26,903
He really wants to show you

477
00:23:26,937 --> 00:23:28,281
one of his favorite
places of all Spain.

478
00:23:28,304 --> 00:23:30,274
It's called the cliffs
of cap de for mentor.

479
00:23:30,306 --> 00:23:32,709
Yeah, see, well,
I'm very jet lagged,

480
00:23:32,743 --> 00:23:35,611
so I won't be
attending that, okay?

481
00:23:35,646 --> 00:23:36,679
Thank you.

482
00:23:39,783 --> 00:23:41,651
Oh, my god! Mr. Cage.

483
00:23:41,685 --> 00:23:43,620
If Mr. Gutierrez is asking you

484
00:23:43,653 --> 00:23:45,054
to go with him
and see the cliffs,

485
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:46,700
you're gonna go with
him and see the cliffs.

486
00:23:46,724 --> 00:23:48,057
And you're gonna
love the cliffs.

487
00:23:48,091 --> 00:23:49,626
Even if you hate the cliffs!

488
00:23:50,293 --> 00:23:51,695
Are we clear?

489
00:23:54,063 --> 00:23:56,632
Gabriela said you are
really excited about the cliffs.

490
00:23:56,667 --> 00:24:00,670
Yeah, very much so. It's just...

491
00:24:00,704 --> 00:24:03,006
I'm not feeling
tip-top right now,

492
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,807
so if you wanna
go out there alone,

493
00:24:04,841 --> 00:24:07,578
I could go back to
the room... oh, shit!

494
00:24:07,611 --> 00:24:09,045
Shit! What?

495
00:24:12,082 --> 00:24:14,217
We must go now.

496
00:24:14,251 --> 00:24:15,686
Hey!

497
00:24:17,321 --> 00:24:18,521
Javi!

498
00:24:21,824 --> 00:24:22,993
Javi!

499
00:24:23,026 --> 00:24:24,594
What is going on?

500
00:24:24,628 --> 00:24:25,763
Faster!

501
00:24:25,795 --> 00:24:27,598
What are we running from?

502
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,899
The general!

503
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,668
Javi!

504
00:24:33,704 --> 00:24:35,304
Hey!

505
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:37,083
You need to tell me right
now what the hell is going on,

506
00:24:37,107 --> 00:24:38,341
or I'm getting my shit,

507
00:24:38,374 --> 00:24:39,686
and I'm going back
to Los Angeles.

508
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:40,710
The general!

509
00:24:42,211 --> 00:24:45,149
The general forbade me
to see his daughter Matilda.

510
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,850
But we defied his orders!

511
00:24:48,885 --> 00:24:53,055
And now, he
wants to end my life.

512
00:24:53,089 --> 00:24:54,590
Can't you see him?

513
00:25:00,129 --> 00:25:02,098
All right, all right, I get it.

514
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,299
You're making this up?

515
00:25:03,331 --> 00:25:04,867
What is this?

516
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,170
Like a little stanislavski
improv thing?

517
00:25:08,204 --> 00:25:09,671
Well, you can stop.

518
00:25:09,705 --> 00:25:11,640
Stanislavski? Is he
part of the resistance?

519
00:25:11,674 --> 00:25:14,709
Stop! I am your guest!

520
00:25:14,744 --> 00:25:17,146
Gabriela ripped the
bedspread off me this morning.

521
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:20,183
Now you're sending me
on, like, a wild goose chase!

522
00:25:20,215 --> 00:25:22,717
I'm sorry, but you can't
quit acting! You can't!

523
00:25:22,752 --> 00:25:24,253
That's none of your business.

524
00:25:24,286 --> 00:25:27,657
Whether you like it
or not, you have a gift.

525
00:25:27,689 --> 00:25:32,160
And that gift brings light
and joy to an increasingly

526
00:25:33,196 --> 00:25:35,931
dark and broken world!

527
00:25:35,965 --> 00:25:39,401
And to turn your
back on that gift

528
00:25:39,435 --> 00:25:43,638
is to turn your back on
the entire human race.

529
00:25:44,806 --> 00:25:46,141
The human race?

530
00:25:46,175 --> 00:25:48,244
I'm afraid so.

531
00:25:48,276 --> 00:25:50,213
What am I gonna do?

532
00:25:50,245 --> 00:25:51,714
Oh, wow. If we don't go now,

533
00:25:51,746 --> 00:25:54,183
they will fucking kill us!

534
00:25:54,216 --> 00:25:55,717
These people smell blood

535
00:25:55,751 --> 00:25:56,962
and they come running.
What am I gonna do?

536
00:25:56,985 --> 00:25:58,430
They're almost to
the edge of the forest.

537
00:25:58,454 --> 00:25:59,921
I can hear them.

538
00:25:59,956 --> 00:26:01,890
And Matilda, she is
waiting down the coast.

539
00:26:01,924 --> 00:26:04,627
We have to go now!
We have to jump!

540
00:26:13,168 --> 00:26:16,038
You're in an
untenable situation.

541
00:26:16,071 --> 00:26:17,139
You know that, right?

542
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:20,176
So tell me one thing.

543
00:26:21,878 --> 00:26:23,379
Do you love her?

544
00:26:23,411 --> 00:26:25,447
I've always loved her.

545
00:26:25,481 --> 00:26:29,752
Then let's get you
out of here alive.

546
00:26:36,892 --> 00:26:39,427
Oh, shit!

547
00:26:43,331 --> 00:26:45,399
Fuck!

548
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:46,834
Oh, god!

549
00:26:46,868 --> 00:26:48,146
I didn't know there was a cliff!

550
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:49,870
I didn't know it was that high!

551
00:26:49,905 --> 00:26:51,138
We could have died!

552
00:26:54,074 --> 00:26:55,209
You're a wild man.

553
00:26:57,878 --> 00:26:59,159
I prefer bourbon, but thank you.

554
00:27:01,849 --> 00:27:03,685
God, this place is stunning.

555
00:27:04,953 --> 00:27:06,420
I bet my daughter

556
00:27:06,454 --> 00:27:08,389
would like it out here.
It'd be good for her.

557
00:27:08,423 --> 00:27:10,058
Are you two close?

558
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:13,128
Well, it's impossible to
be close with a 16-year-old.

559
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,362
But I've tried to be
there for her. It's just...

560
00:27:15,397 --> 00:27:17,831
There's no script for parenting.

561
00:27:17,866 --> 00:27:20,801
Thank god for my ex, Olivia.

562
00:27:20,834 --> 00:27:22,337
How did you meet Olivia?

563
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:25,740
She was a make-up artist
on <i>captain corelli's mandolin.</i>

564
00:27:25,773 --> 00:27:27,208
Beautiful film. Thank you.

565
00:27:27,242 --> 00:27:29,043
Underrated for sure.

566
00:27:29,077 --> 00:27:30,244
We just hit it off, you know.

567
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:32,880
She was funny, smart, beautiful.

568
00:27:32,914 --> 00:27:34,148
So, what happened?

569
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:37,118
What happened?

570
00:27:41,255 --> 00:27:44,091
What about you? Ever
been married? Kids?

571
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:45,126
No.

572
00:27:46,828 --> 00:27:49,731
There is one woman, but, uh,

573
00:27:51,532 --> 00:27:55,537
sometimes circumstances
get in the way of love

574
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,304
and that's just the way it is.

575
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:05,246
Anyway, Mr. Cage,

576
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,115
what is your favorite movie?

577
00:28:07,147 --> 00:28:10,551
Oh... favorite movie?

578
00:28:10,586 --> 00:28:15,490
Oh, wow! I mean,
that... that is, uh...

579
00:28:15,522 --> 00:28:18,959
That's one of those questions
that's impossible to answer.

580
00:28:18,993 --> 00:28:23,397
Because, you see,
100-plus years of rich cinema.

581
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,266
You can't just limit it to one.

582
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,369
It depends upon your
mood, the seasons.

583
00:28:28,403 --> 00:28:30,972
All right, let's do
top three. You start.

584
00:28:31,005 --> 00:28:33,073
Number one, <i>face/off.</i>

585
00:28:33,108 --> 00:28:34,242
Oh, thank you.

586
00:28:35,843 --> 00:28:37,544
Woo is a maestro. Thank you.

587
00:28:39,214 --> 00:28:40,948
Number two, let me think...

588
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,884
<i>The cabinet of Dr. Caligari.</i>

589
00:28:43,916 --> 00:28:46,252
You love
<i>caligari?</i> I love <i>caligari.</i>

590
00:28:46,287 --> 00:28:49,556
Wow! I was beginning to
think I was the only one.

591
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,457
You gonna run
the table here, jav?

592
00:28:51,492 --> 00:28:55,896
It's hard. It's like you said,
100-plus years of rich cinema.

593
00:28:56,929 --> 00:28:58,965
Thank you.

594
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:01,435
Look, can you just stop stalling

595
00:29:01,467 --> 00:29:03,102
and answer the question?

596
00:29:03,136 --> 00:29:05,204
What is your third
favorite movie of all time?

597
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:10,578
<i>Paddington 2.</i>

598
00:29:10,611 --> 00:29:12,879
What?

599
00:29:12,913 --> 00:29:14,616
<i>Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,
Paddington 2.</i>

600
00:29:14,648 --> 00:29:16,015
Connect those dots.

601
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,427
I mean, I don't wanna
be a snob, but...

602
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:19,019
I cried through
the entire thing.

603
00:29:19,052 --> 00:29:20,486
It made me want
to be a better man.

604
00:29:20,521 --> 00:29:23,089
Bullshit, man!

605
00:29:30,196 --> 00:29:32,098
<i>Paddington 2</i> is incredible.

606
00:29:33,635 --> 00:29:35,469
I fucking told you.

607
00:29:40,973 --> 00:29:42,408
Truth or dare, Nick?

608
00:29:43,277 --> 00:29:44,345
Truth.

609
00:29:49,983 --> 00:29:53,087
Did you hate my
screenplay? It's okay if you did.

610
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:54,387
I just need to know.

611
00:29:54,421 --> 00:29:56,255
You wrote a script?

612
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:59,059
I sent it to your agent.

613
00:29:59,092 --> 00:30:00,337
He was supposed
to give it to you.

614
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,663
Well, he didn't.

615
00:30:01,695 --> 00:30:03,963
I guess I can
understand why he didn't,

616
00:30:03,996 --> 00:30:05,599
but where is it?
I'll read it right now.

617
00:30:05,633 --> 00:30:07,467
Now? Like, right now? Right now.

618
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:08,502
Send it.

619
00:30:19,512 --> 00:30:21,582
I sent it. Fantastic.

620
00:30:21,616 --> 00:30:25,219
Let's go into town,
have a celebratory drink.

621
00:30:25,252 --> 00:30:27,087
You can watch me read it.

622
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,056
See where it
drags. It'll be fun.

623
00:30:29,088 --> 00:30:30,190
No.

624
00:30:31,258 --> 00:30:33,193
Honestly, I'm too nervous.

625
00:30:33,226 --> 00:30:34,596
My heart is beating so fast.

626
00:30:37,665 --> 00:30:39,298
I think I need to go to bed.

627
00:30:40,098 --> 00:30:44,069
Listen, Javi, truth.

628
00:30:44,103 --> 00:30:46,506
I wasn't that thrilled
about coming out here,

629
00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:49,576
but tonight has
been the most fun

630
00:30:49,609 --> 00:30:52,944
I've had in a long, long time.

631
00:30:52,979 --> 00:30:55,181
So, thank you.

632
00:31:12,498 --> 00:31:14,635
Oh. Hey, Nicky.

633
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:16,301
So, you're unretired then?

634
00:31:16,335 --> 00:31:18,136
That's the idea.

635
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:22,474
Javi inspired you, did
he? You like this guy?

636
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:24,578
He has good taste in movies.

637
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,613
Plus, it could be
good for me to do

638
00:31:26,646 --> 00:31:30,584
some smaller roles
with great directors.

639
00:31:30,616 --> 00:31:33,019
Some challenging character work.

640
00:31:33,051 --> 00:31:35,221
Huh. So, like, um... like what?

641
00:31:35,253 --> 00:31:36,757
The gay uncle

642
00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:39,090
in the next duplass
brothers movie kind of thing?

643
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:40,393
Exactly.

644
00:31:40,425 --> 00:31:43,029
What the fuck are
you talking about?

645
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:45,030
We haven't worked
since you were 15...

646
00:31:45,064 --> 00:31:47,500
Forty-one years to
be number seven

647
00:31:47,532 --> 00:31:50,502
on a call sheet of a
goddamn student film.

648
00:31:50,536 --> 00:31:52,104
I think it's a good idea.

649
00:31:52,137 --> 00:31:53,405
You listen to me.

650
00:31:53,439 --> 00:31:56,142
You're Nick fucking...

651
00:32:05,818 --> 00:32:08,520
Cage!

652
00:32:08,553 --> 00:32:10,790
Addy doesn't need a
struggling artist for a father.

653
00:32:10,824 --> 00:32:13,459
She needs you to be a star.

654
00:32:13,492 --> 00:32:16,395
Now you get the next
one, baby, and we're back.

655
00:32:16,428 --> 00:32:18,030
Not that we went anywhere.

656
00:32:18,064 --> 00:32:21,667
Not that we went anywhere.

657
00:32:21,702 --> 00:32:23,001
Come here.

658
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:35,514
Yeah, Nick cage smooches good.

659
00:32:35,548 --> 00:32:39,483
You tell 'em! Nick
cage smooches good!

660
00:32:40,484 --> 00:32:41,753
I'll have another one.

661
00:32:55,299 --> 00:32:56,334
Jesus!

662
00:32:58,235 --> 00:33:00,171
What do you guys
want? You want money?

663
00:33:00,204 --> 00:33:02,507
Here, take my watch.
It's not a copy, it's real.

664
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,577
Mr. Cage, we're with the U.S.
government. We need your help.

665
00:33:05,611 --> 00:33:07,479
The man you're
staying with is the head

666
00:33:07,511 --> 00:33:09,481
of a violent
international arms cartel.

667
00:33:09,513 --> 00:33:11,750
Wait, wait, wait. Javi?

668
00:33:11,784 --> 00:33:13,618
He's a ruthless motherfucker.

669
00:33:13,653 --> 00:33:15,621
He started small, coastal Spain.

670
00:33:15,654 --> 00:33:17,288
But then, he got greedy.

671
00:33:17,321 --> 00:33:20,291
Trying to expand his
operations east, west.

672
00:33:20,325 --> 00:33:22,160
Trail of dead
bodies in his wake.

673
00:33:22,192 --> 00:33:23,260
Javi Gutierrez?

674
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:24,763
Yes, Javi.

675
00:33:24,797 --> 00:33:26,407
I don't think we're talking
about the same Javi.

676
00:33:26,431 --> 00:33:27,643
We're definitely talking
about the same fucking Javi.

677
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:28,677
It's the same fucking guy, man.

678
00:33:28,701 --> 00:33:30,702
Okay, okay. So, you're CIA,

679
00:33:30,736 --> 00:33:32,470
some kind of
intelligence, right?

680
00:33:32,503 --> 00:33:34,372
And your job is to
read people, yeah?

681
00:33:34,405 --> 00:33:36,540
Well, as a thespian,
that is also my job.

682
00:33:36,576 --> 00:33:37,786
To understand
people's characters,

683
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:39,376
to feel what they're feeling.

684
00:33:39,411 --> 00:33:42,581
Which is how I know that
Javi is not a gun dealer.

685
00:33:42,615 --> 00:33:44,281
You're saying
your acting ability

686
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:45,884
trumps five years of hard data

687
00:33:45,917 --> 00:33:48,420
collected by the world's
finest intelligence agency?

688
00:33:48,452 --> 00:33:50,789
My nouveau
shamanic acting ability?

689
00:33:50,823 --> 00:33:52,156
You better fucking believe it.

690
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,459
Oh! Hey, guys, this sucks.

691
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:57,563
Uh, Nicolas cage's nouveau
shamanic acting ability

692
00:33:57,596 --> 00:33:59,632
has determined that
we got the wrong guy.

693
00:33:59,664 --> 00:34:02,200
So, let's pack up our
shit and fucking go home.

694
00:34:02,232 --> 00:34:04,636
Hey, man, don't mind him.
He's all messed up inside.

695
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:07,172
He just found out his
wife's been fucking his dad.

696
00:34:07,204 --> 00:34:09,875
That's not all the way true.

697
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:12,277
Look, do you
recognize this girl?

698
00:34:14,378 --> 00:34:15,413
No.

699
00:34:15,447 --> 00:34:17,215
It's Maria delgado.

700
00:34:17,248 --> 00:34:19,351
President of
catalonia's daughter.

701
00:34:19,384 --> 00:34:20,920
Javi's men kidnapped
her two days ago

702
00:34:20,952 --> 00:34:22,463
to force her father
out of the election

703
00:34:22,487 --> 00:34:24,355
and make way for
someone more cartel-friendly.

704
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:25,824
Yeah, the U.S.
doesn't like that.

705
00:34:25,858 --> 00:34:27,324
Yeah, look, hey.

706
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:29,661
We need to access
Javi's security cameras.

707
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:31,172
We can't get anywhere
near that compound

708
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:32,396
because it's too fortified.

709
00:34:33,397 --> 00:34:34,665
And then, you show up.

710
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:36,366
So, you want me to, what?

711
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,701
Spy on Javi?

712
00:34:37,736 --> 00:34:39,203
Bingo.

713
00:34:39,236 --> 00:34:40,772
Yeah, I'm not doing that.

714
00:34:40,805 --> 00:34:42,439
You have a daughter
about her age, right?

715
00:34:43,774 --> 00:34:45,375
This came in yesterday.

716
00:34:47,946 --> 00:34:50,513
How do you think
you would feel, huh?

717
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,515
Knowing you could have helped?

718
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:54,218
<i>But you chose not to.</i>

719
00:34:55,687 --> 00:34:58,622
<i>Be a lot of guilt to
carry, wouldn't it?</i>

720
00:34:58,656 --> 00:35:01,759
<i>Because every time
you look at your daughter,</i>

721
00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:03,359
<i>believe me,</i>

722
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,763
<i>you are gonna
see that little girl</i>

723
00:35:05,796 --> 00:35:08,364
<i>buried in a ditch somewhere.</i>

724
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:10,433
<i>And that will haunt you</i>

725
00:35:10,466 --> 00:35:13,738
<i>for the rest of your life.</i>

726
00:35:22,881 --> 00:35:24,515
<i>All right, here we go, Nick.</i>

727
00:35:24,547 --> 00:35:26,259
<i>We're going to create
a power blip big enough</i>

728
00:35:26,283 --> 00:35:27,986
<i>to reboot all the
security cameras.</i>

729
00:35:28,018 --> 00:35:29,754
<i>Once that happens,</i>

730
00:35:29,788 --> 00:35:31,656
<i>you got exactly four
minutes and ten seconds</i>

731
00:35:31,689 --> 00:35:33,692
<i>to get in and get out before
they come back online.</i>

732
00:36:35,885 --> 00:36:37,621
<i>Don't forget. Set the cameras,</i>

733
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,789
<i>and then grab them
when you leave.</i>

734
00:36:49,032 --> 00:36:50,800
Uh-oh. Oh, shit, we
got a guy coming.

735
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,334
<i>Nick, guard on the way.</i>

736
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:53,579
<i>All right, Nick, stay calm.</i>

737
00:36:53,603 --> 00:36:55,072
<i>Just like we talked about.</i>

738
00:36:55,104 --> 00:36:57,840
Take the incapacitating
agent out of the pouch.

739
00:36:57,874 --> 00:36:58,976
<i>Put it in your hand.</i>

740
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,610
<i>Remove the outer layer.</i>

741
00:37:00,644 --> 00:37:02,646
<i>The inner layer has
the chemical on it.</i>

742
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,023
<i>Now, if you touch
that to someone's skin,</i>

743
00:37:04,046 --> 00:37:05,581
<i>they'll be out in seconds.</i>

744
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:08,751
<i>Now, find a place to hide.</i>

745
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:11,588
There's nowhere to hide in here.

746
00:37:12,588 --> 00:37:13,624
Hold on.

747
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,061
I think I can hide under the...

748
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:21,697
I touched my forehead.

749
00:37:21,731 --> 00:37:23,099
You touched your forehead?

750
00:37:23,133 --> 00:37:24,802
I think so. I'm not 100% sure.

751
00:37:24,834 --> 00:37:26,334
Did you or didn't you?

752
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,730
You know what?
I don't think I did.

753
00:37:31,574 --> 00:37:33,644
I did. I did.

754
00:37:33,677 --> 00:37:35,478
<i>Nick, listen to me right now.</i>

755
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,123
You have 30 seconds until
you're drooling on the floor.

756
00:37:37,146 --> 00:37:39,983
<i>Go back into the pouch
and get the antidote asap.</i>

757
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,353
It's locked.

758
00:37:45,387 --> 00:37:46,699
<i>Where's the
key that we gave you?</i>

759
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:49,025
Inside with the antidote.

760
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:52,360
Oh, fuck this shit!
Okay. Oh, shit. Okay.

761
00:37:55,865 --> 00:37:57,967
<i>Okay, Nick,
there's a window to your left.</i>

762
00:37:58,001 --> 00:38:00,037
Go out that window, get outside,

763
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,537
go across the ledge, okay?

764
00:38:01,572 --> 00:38:03,139
Scoot across the ledge,

765
00:38:03,173 --> 00:38:04,934
<i>and then climb into the
security room window.</i>

766
00:38:06,441 --> 00:38:07,653
What the fuck is wrong with
you? He's three stories up.

767
00:38:07,677 --> 00:38:08,798
He's stoned out of his mind.

768
00:38:12,983 --> 00:38:13,983
<i>Hola.</i>

769
00:38:15,818 --> 00:38:18,554
<i>Do it now, Nick!
Now! He's getting closer.</i>

770
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,488
He's fucking dead. He's dead.

771
00:38:20,523 --> 00:38:23,092
Martin, I can hear you.

772
00:38:34,669 --> 00:38:36,471
Come on, Nick. You
can do this, okay?

773
00:38:36,504 --> 00:38:38,506
Keep moving. Keep moving.

774
00:38:40,507 --> 00:38:41,509
<i>Hola?</i>

775
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:49,719
I can't feel my legs.

776
00:38:49,752 --> 00:38:51,754
You know, I really
enjoyed working for the CIA.

777
00:38:51,786 --> 00:38:54,156
Can't wait to move back
home and work at fucking Sonic.

778
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:55,891
Shit!

779
00:38:57,458 --> 00:38:59,460
Like rubber.

780
00:38:59,493 --> 00:39:01,998
Come on, Nick, you got
this. Keep moving, okay?

781
00:39:06,868 --> 00:39:08,870
<i>Hold on. We got a
guard in the room.</i>

782
00:39:12,174 --> 00:39:13,540
<i>Wake up, Nick.</i>

783
00:39:15,678 --> 00:39:17,680
<i>Okay, go, go, go, Nick.</i>

784
00:39:17,712 --> 00:39:19,781
I love you.

785
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:22,051
<i>Stay with me. Stay awake.</i>

786
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:24,152
<i>Keep moving. You can do this.</i>

787
00:39:24,185 --> 00:39:25,654
<i>Pull your legs in now.</i>

788
00:39:25,687 --> 00:39:26,989
<i>Pull your legs in.</i>

789
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:34,163
I can't move.

790
00:39:34,196 --> 00:39:36,098
Then you're gonna die.
Do you wanna die tonight?

791
00:39:36,132 --> 00:39:37,832
This is not how you die.

792
00:39:37,866 --> 00:39:39,634
I think it is.

793
00:39:49,245 --> 00:39:50,712
Come on.

794
00:39:50,745 --> 00:39:52,248
Come on, you did
it. You're in there.

795
00:39:52,281 --> 00:39:53,882
Do it, do it! Stay awake!

796
00:39:53,915 --> 00:39:55,685
<i>Come on! Come on, Nick!</i>

797
00:39:56,819 --> 00:39:58,120
Come on. Come on.

798
00:39:58,154 --> 00:39:59,486
Come on. You got it.

799
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,022
You got it. You got it.

800
00:40:01,056 --> 00:40:02,190
You got it. You got it.

801
00:40:04,759 --> 00:40:06,995
Oh, for fuck's sake,
man! Wake up!

802
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:08,140
<i>Wake up. Wake up.</i>

803
00:40:08,163 --> 00:40:09,864
<i>Get up, Nick. Get up.</i>

804
00:40:09,899 --> 00:40:11,000
<i>Get up.</i>

805
00:40:11,933 --> 00:40:12,969
Come on, Nick.

806
00:40:13,002 --> 00:40:15,136
Come on! Get up!

807
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,538
<i>Get up, Nick.</i>

808
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,743
Action!

809
00:40:26,648 --> 00:40:28,048
Oh, my god!

810
00:40:28,082 --> 00:40:29,684
Yes!

811
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,753
How is he up? Trained actor.

812
00:40:31,785 --> 00:40:33,287
All right, man, we in.

813
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:36,925
You know, it didn't feel
great betraying Javi like that.

814
00:40:36,957 --> 00:40:39,894
Especially, since I'm still
not convinced he's your guy.

815
00:40:39,927 --> 00:40:41,762
But the strange thing is...

816
00:40:41,796 --> 00:40:42,939
I can see myself
doing more of this stuff.

817
00:40:42,963 --> 00:40:44,698
You know, spy craft.

818
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,901
Subterfuge. What have you.

819
00:40:46,934 --> 00:40:48,669
I think I might
have a real gift for it.

820
00:40:48,702 --> 00:40:50,637
Good, 'cause we got
another mission for you.

821
00:40:50,671 --> 00:40:53,108
No, no, no! Fuck that!

822
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,876
It was terrifying.

823
00:40:54,909 --> 00:40:56,988
I'm about to leave for the
airport after the party, so...

824
00:40:57,012 --> 00:41:00,581
Nick, our intel suggests that
Javi is holding Maria delgado

825
00:41:00,615 --> 00:41:02,584
on the compound right now.

826
00:41:02,617 --> 00:41:04,084
On the compound? <i>Yeah.</i>

827
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:05,787
We need you to help us find her.

828
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,088
Which means we need you

829
00:41:07,122 --> 00:41:08,990
to figure out a way
to stay a little longer.

830
00:41:09,023 --> 00:41:12,927
Vivian, I can't do this.

831
00:41:12,961 --> 00:41:14,963
Yes, you can. We
just saw you do it.

832
00:41:15,896 --> 00:41:17,298
That little girl, Nick?

833
00:41:17,331 --> 00:41:18,900
She doesn't have anybody else.

834
00:41:20,834 --> 00:41:21,836
<i>Just you.</i>

835
00:41:23,171 --> 00:41:25,240
<i>And if you leave,</i>

836
00:41:25,273 --> 00:41:27,642
<i>I don't know what's
gonna happen to her.</i>

837
00:41:43,258 --> 00:41:45,994
I just want to thank you
all for coming tonight.

838
00:41:46,026 --> 00:41:48,095
It means more to me
than you can know.

839
00:41:48,128 --> 00:41:50,264
And I would like
to tell a story.

840
00:41:51,198 --> 00:41:53,168
A few years ago,

841
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,102
my relationship with my father

842
00:41:55,135 --> 00:41:57,171
had deteriorated to the point

843
00:41:57,204 --> 00:42:00,041
where we were
no longer speaking.

844
00:42:00,075 --> 00:42:01,218
He could be extremely difficult,

845
00:42:01,242 --> 00:42:02,843
my father.

846
00:42:02,876 --> 00:42:04,746
And to be fair, maybe
I am not much better.

847
00:42:07,215 --> 00:42:08,749
But when he got sick,

848
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,885
I realized

849
00:42:11,919 --> 00:42:13,655
I didn't want to lose him

850
00:42:13,688 --> 00:42:16,825
before we could repair
our broken relationship.

851
00:42:17,925 --> 00:42:19,226
But I didn't know how.

852
00:42:20,194 --> 00:42:21,728
And then, one day,

853
00:42:21,761 --> 00:42:24,897
about a week before
he died, it happened.

854
00:42:24,931 --> 00:42:26,033
A miracle.

855
00:42:26,933 --> 00:42:28,000
I looked up...

856
00:42:30,437 --> 00:42:33,873
And I saw on a tiny
little hospital TV...

857
00:42:33,906 --> 00:42:36,710
<i>Guarding Tess.</i>

858
00:42:36,743 --> 00:42:40,848
We disagreed about literally
everything, my father and I.

859
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,149
Except for this movie.

860
00:42:43,449 --> 00:42:45,319
We both loved it.

861
00:42:45,351 --> 00:42:48,288
We would quote
it back and forth.

862
00:42:48,321 --> 00:42:51,424
In a way, my father was Tess.

863
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:52,926
The former first lady.

864
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,895
And I was Doug chesnic.

865
00:42:55,929 --> 00:42:57,130
The secret service agent

866
00:42:57,163 --> 00:42:58,799
charged with taking care of him.

867
00:43:00,868 --> 00:43:04,837
That movie brought us together.

868
00:43:06,772 --> 00:43:10,911
So, on behalf of my
late father and myself,

869
00:43:12,946 --> 00:43:14,313
I want to thank you.

870
00:43:19,386 --> 00:43:21,388
I bet you didn't know
Doug chesnic could have

871
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,322
such an impact on someone.

872
00:43:23,357 --> 00:43:26,859
Well, Doug was
a complicated guy.

873
00:43:26,893 --> 00:43:28,328
He had, um,

874
00:43:29,462 --> 00:43:30,998
competing allegiances

875
00:43:31,031 --> 00:43:32,366
and sometimes,

876
00:43:32,399 --> 00:43:35,835
being in the skin of
a character like that

877
00:43:36,937 --> 00:43:38,404
can take its toll.

878
00:43:38,438 --> 00:43:39,940
Well, thank you
for your sacrifice.

879
00:43:39,973 --> 00:43:41,275
It was extraordinary.

880
00:43:41,308 --> 00:43:43,009
Thank you for having me.

881
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,746
And I'm...

882
00:43:48,748 --> 00:43:49,850
I'm...

883
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:53,453
Excited to announce that

884
00:43:53,487 --> 00:43:58,424
Javi has finally allowed
me to read his screenplay

885
00:43:58,458 --> 00:44:00,761
which is fantastic.

886
00:44:00,793 --> 00:44:02,795
It's truly a masterclass.

887
00:44:02,828 --> 00:44:05,399
It's easily one of the best
things I've read in years.

888
00:44:05,431 --> 00:44:07,400
So, does that mean
that you want to be in it?

889
00:44:07,433 --> 00:44:08,467
I don't.

890
00:44:08,502 --> 00:44:11,938
But what I would like is to

891
00:44:11,971 --> 00:44:14,241
spend a little more time here

892
00:44:14,274 --> 00:44:17,443
on the compound with you.

893
00:44:17,475 --> 00:44:19,412
Coming up with our own...

894
00:44:20,345 --> 00:44:21,479
Movie.

895
00:44:22,247 --> 00:44:23,316
What do you say?

896
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:27,352
I say yes.

897
00:44:29,555 --> 00:44:30,756
Yes.

898
00:44:36,329 --> 00:44:38,164
<i>I fired Earl.</i>

899
00:44:38,196 --> 00:44:39,374
<i>- This has happened twice now.
- No.</i>

900
00:44:39,398 --> 00:44:40,865
<i>He is a driver</i>

901
00:44:40,899 --> 00:44:43,302
<i>in the employ of
the secret service.</i>

902
00:44:43,336 --> 00:44:44,780
<i>I can't do anything about
the cook or the nurse.</i>

903
00:44:44,803 --> 00:44:46,271
<i>No, they work for you.</i>

904
00:44:46,305 --> 00:44:48,039
<i>But this guy works
for us and he's gone!</i>

905
00:44:52,345 --> 00:44:54,180
<i>Nick.</i>

906
00:44:54,213 --> 00:44:56,390
The security cameras gave
us a probable location for Maria.

907
00:44:56,414 --> 00:44:59,084
I'm sending it to you now.

908
00:44:59,117 --> 00:45:00,753
<i>Find a way to get
into that room, Nick.</i>

909
00:45:05,258 --> 00:45:06,258
Mr. Cage.

910
00:45:07,325 --> 00:45:09,394
Oh, hey, Javi. Nick.

911
00:45:09,428 --> 00:45:11,430
I realized

912
00:45:11,463 --> 00:45:15,468
that if we are going
to create a work of art,

913
00:45:15,501 --> 00:45:17,436
we can't just sit and
stare at a screen.

914
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:19,573
We have to open our minds

915
00:45:19,606 --> 00:45:21,106
to the infinite possibilities

916
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,541
of what the cosmos has to offer.

917
00:45:24,443 --> 00:45:25,910
What have you got there?

918
00:45:25,945 --> 00:45:27,445
Divine inspiration.

919
00:45:35,954 --> 00:45:37,957
Fuck it!

920
00:45:57,276 --> 00:45:59,378
So, I was thinking
that maybe our movie

921
00:45:59,412 --> 00:46:01,113
would be character-driven.

922
00:46:01,146 --> 00:46:02,914
Yeah.

923
00:46:02,948 --> 00:46:06,519
Something that doesn't
rely on corny special effects.

924
00:46:06,553 --> 00:46:09,021
Right. Or like big explosions.

925
00:46:09,055 --> 00:46:10,557
It has to be nuanced.

926
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:12,524
And work on multiple levels.

927
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:15,326
It should be completely
about performance.

928
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,395
And maybe it's just
the drugs talking,

929
00:46:18,429 --> 00:46:21,165
but what if we had
like a big drug scene?

930
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:24,302
Oh, wow!

931
00:46:25,936 --> 00:46:28,005
It's gonna be so fucking good.

932
00:46:30,308 --> 00:46:31,308
But, like,

933
00:46:32,476 --> 00:46:33,578
what's it about?

934
00:46:42,152 --> 00:46:44,355
<i>In terms of
genre, I like comedies.</i>

935
00:46:44,389 --> 00:46:47,525
But not when it's just two
people sitting around talking.

936
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:51,261
Oh, man, I can't
stand talkie comedies.

937
00:46:51,295 --> 00:46:53,632
You gotta have some
plot to drive it forward.

938
00:47:01,005 --> 00:47:02,005
It's my daughter.

939
00:47:02,407 --> 00:47:03,440
Oh.

940
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:19,891
Nick, listen.

941
00:47:21,192 --> 00:47:23,427
You know what I was thinking?

942
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:26,531
Maybe we could have, like,
a paranoid thriller-y angle.

943
00:47:26,565 --> 00:47:30,168
Ooh. Paranoid angle. Excellent.

944
00:47:30,201 --> 00:47:31,602
Like, see those
two guys over there?

945
00:47:33,505 --> 00:47:34,639
They've been watching us.

946
00:47:34,672 --> 00:47:36,107
Right. Right.

947
00:47:38,308 --> 00:47:40,145
Wait, have they
been watching us?

948
00:47:40,177 --> 00:47:42,147
I don't know. Have they?

949
00:47:44,549 --> 00:47:47,384
Fuck!

950
00:47:47,418 --> 00:47:49,386
Did you see that? They
just looked over at us.

951
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,422
Oh, shit!

952
00:47:51,456 --> 00:47:54,025
Oh, shit! What's going on?

953
00:47:54,058 --> 00:47:55,469
No, no, no. Maybe it
was just a coincidence.

954
00:47:55,493 --> 00:47:56,960
I will look again.
Are you ready?

955
00:47:56,994 --> 00:47:58,195
No! Don't make eye contact.

956
00:47:58,228 --> 00:47:59,665
That's how you spook them.

957
00:47:59,697 --> 00:48:01,733
No, that's how you spook a bear.

958
00:48:01,766 --> 00:48:04,034
That's right. That is
how you spook a bear.

959
00:48:04,067 --> 00:48:05,637
I apologize.

960
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:09,040
But if you are gonna look,
maybe do like a fake laugh.

961
00:48:09,072 --> 00:48:10,707
A fake laugh? Okay, good. Yeah.

962
00:48:18,783 --> 00:48:20,216
Oh, no.

963
00:48:20,249 --> 00:48:23,019
Okay, okay. Let's...

964
00:48:23,053 --> 00:48:25,421
Let's just get up slowly

965
00:48:25,455 --> 00:48:27,156
on the count of three

966
00:48:27,191 --> 00:48:28,593
and run.

967
00:48:28,626 --> 00:48:30,160
Okay?

968
00:48:30,193 --> 00:48:31,227
One...

969
00:48:32,261 --> 00:48:33,263
Oh, fuck!

970
00:48:38,635 --> 00:48:40,037
Go, go, go!

971
00:48:41,104 --> 00:48:42,205
Faster!

972
00:48:43,807 --> 00:48:45,309
This is fucking crazy.

973
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:47,611
Oh, shit!

974
00:48:47,644 --> 00:48:48,713
It's too high.

975
00:48:48,745 --> 00:48:50,247
Here.

976
00:48:51,515 --> 00:48:53,517
Use me as a human stool.

977
00:48:54,517 --> 00:48:55,620
Do it!

978
00:49:04,327 --> 00:49:05,328
Grab my hand.

979
00:49:06,162 --> 00:49:07,164
Grab it.

980
00:49:11,133 --> 00:49:12,401
You're heavier than you look.

981
00:49:16,472 --> 00:49:17,675
I have a very big head.

982
00:49:17,709 --> 00:49:20,077
Enormous. An enormous head.

983
00:49:22,379 --> 00:49:24,682
I'm not gonna make it, am I?

984
00:49:24,716 --> 00:49:26,584
Will you tell Gabriela
I will miss her?

985
00:49:26,618 --> 00:49:28,484
You can tell her yourself. No.

986
00:49:28,519 --> 00:49:31,153
It's okay. You
go live a good life.

987
00:49:31,187 --> 00:49:32,533
I'm not going
anywhere without you!

988
00:49:32,557 --> 00:49:35,225
Now, grab my hand, soldier!

989
00:49:41,298 --> 00:49:43,165
But then, we will both die

990
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,135
and I could never live
with myself after that.

991
00:49:45,167 --> 00:49:46,403
So you let go.

992
00:49:47,504 --> 00:49:48,504
You let go!

993
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,180
Goodbye, Nicolas cage.

994
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:02,084
I'll never forget you, javs.

995
00:50:02,118 --> 00:50:03,555
I'll never forget you.

996
00:50:05,222 --> 00:50:07,389
Now, you get the
hell out of here.

997
00:50:09,324 --> 00:50:11,059
You go!

998
00:50:23,139 --> 00:50:24,273
Mr. Cage?

999
00:50:26,242 --> 00:50:27,242
Javi?

1000
00:50:28,344 --> 00:50:29,679
Buddy! Hey.

1001
00:50:30,581 --> 00:50:31,847
Where'd you come from?

1002
00:50:33,148 --> 00:50:34,150
Oh.

1003
00:50:35,317 --> 00:50:36,351
Yeah...

1004
00:50:38,154 --> 00:50:39,666
Turns out we could
have just walked around.

1005
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:41,757
Yeah, I guess so, huh? Whatever.

1006
00:50:43,759 --> 00:50:44,860
There they are.

1007
00:50:46,529 --> 00:50:48,864
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Run!

1008
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:52,568
Do you see 'em?

1009
00:50:52,603 --> 00:50:54,771
Oh, fuck! Oh!

1010
00:50:54,804 --> 00:50:56,137
Shit!

1011
00:50:57,405 --> 00:50:58,407
Ow, ow.

1012
00:51:01,945 --> 00:51:04,447
No, no. I can't drive on
acid. I can't drive on acid.

1013
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,681
You have to drive on acid.

1014
00:51:05,715 --> 00:51:07,248
You are a better driver than me.

1015
00:51:07,282 --> 00:51:08,918
How do you know that?

1016
00:51:08,951 --> 00:51:10,228
Because I read that you did
all of your own driving stunts

1017
00:51:10,251 --> 00:51:11,688
in <i>gone in 60 seconds.</i>

1018
00:51:11,721 --> 00:51:14,289
Well, that's true. I popped
some good wheelies, right?

1019
00:51:14,322 --> 00:51:16,626
The wheelies are
amazing. Now drive the car!

1020
00:51:16,659 --> 00:51:18,527
They're coming! Let's go!

1021
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,844
Oh. Holy shit! What?

1022
00:51:33,876 --> 00:51:35,277
Holy shit!

1023
00:51:35,311 --> 00:51:36,344
What? Do you see 'em?

1024
00:51:36,378 --> 00:51:39,215
No, Nick, I have an idea.

1025
00:51:39,248 --> 00:51:41,918
Maybe this movie,
maybe it's about this.

1026
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,587
About us.

1027
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:45,454
Our relationship.

1028
00:51:47,556 --> 00:51:48,625
That's good.

1029
00:51:50,326 --> 00:51:51,427
That's good.

1030
00:52:28,997 --> 00:52:30,633
Is anyone in there?

1031
00:52:30,665 --> 00:52:31,801
<i>Hola?</i>

1032
00:52:31,834 --> 00:52:32,834
Hello?

1033
00:52:34,502 --> 00:52:35,537
Hello?

1034
00:52:39,374 --> 00:52:41,408
You want me to let
you in there, huh?

1035
00:52:42,912 --> 00:52:43,912
I do.

1036
00:52:44,979 --> 00:52:46,549
I wanna know what's inside.

1037
00:52:46,582 --> 00:52:48,750
Regardless of what
the consequences are?

1038
00:52:58,060 --> 00:52:59,928
Because once you go in there,

1039
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:03,765
it could change the
way you feel about me.

1040
00:53:10,004 --> 00:53:12,841
Our entire relationship
could change, Nick cage.

1041
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:17,312
I need to go in, jav.

1042
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,982
Open the door.

1043
00:53:50,044 --> 00:53:51,546
Is it too much?

1044
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:53,582
Trippy.

1045
00:53:54,816 --> 00:53:56,350
Trippy.

1046
00:53:56,383 --> 00:53:58,854
I know. I am
sorry if it is weird.

1047
00:53:58,888 --> 00:54:00,854
Well, it's a good collection.

1048
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:04,925
It's very thorough.

1049
00:54:04,958 --> 00:54:08,028
"A really elegant string
of pearls configuration."

1050
00:54:09,097 --> 00:54:10,364
<i>The rock.</i>

1051
00:54:10,396 --> 00:54:13,034
"Put the bunny back in the box."

1052
00:54:13,066 --> 00:54:14,501
<i>Con air.</i>

1053
00:54:16,536 --> 00:54:19,574
Well, that's just really creepy.

1054
00:54:19,606 --> 00:54:21,074
No, it's not creepy.

1055
00:54:21,108 --> 00:54:22,543
Oh.

1056
00:54:22,577 --> 00:54:23,978
Is that the chainsaw from <i>Mandy?</i>

1057
00:54:24,012 --> 00:54:25,079
<i>Mandy</i> is a masterpiece.

1058
00:54:27,081 --> 00:54:28,882
You know those
are real guns, right?

1059
00:54:28,916 --> 00:54:30,585
Of course they are real.

1060
00:54:33,021 --> 00:54:35,956
Custom Springfield armory.

1061
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:38,960
Made specifically for the film.

1062
00:54:38,992 --> 00:54:40,862
Is this supposed to be me?

1063
00:54:41,595 --> 00:54:42,729
It's...

1064
00:54:43,396 --> 00:54:44,632
Grotesque.

1065
00:54:44,666 --> 00:54:46,867
Just look at the guns.

1066
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,802
If you don't mind me asking,

1067
00:54:48,836 --> 00:54:51,039
how much did you pay for this

1068
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,874
disturbing statue?

1069
00:54:53,907 --> 00:54:56,110
Hmm. About $6,000.

1070
00:54:57,811 --> 00:54:59,646
I'll give you $20,000 for it.

1071
00:55:00,981 --> 00:55:02,749
I'm sorry, Mr. Cage,

1072
00:55:04,586 --> 00:55:06,019
but this is not for sale.

1073
00:55:13,795 --> 00:55:15,528
<i>Bad news. Girl's not there.</i>

1074
00:55:15,563 --> 00:55:18,632
Good news. Script's cooking.

1075
00:55:18,666 --> 00:55:20,934
Feels like cassavetes
meets inarritu

1076
00:55:20,969 --> 00:55:22,469
with a dash of Von trier.

1077
00:55:22,501 --> 00:55:24,838
Nick, but... I know
what you're gonna say.

1078
00:55:24,873 --> 00:55:27,175
Javi has his issues but, my god,

1079
00:55:27,208 --> 00:55:30,409
he has an unbelievably
intuitive sense for story.

1080
00:55:30,443 --> 00:55:32,045
He kidnapped a young girl.

1081
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,581
And every day that passes,
the likelihood goes up

1082
00:55:34,615 --> 00:55:37,619
that she's gonna be murdered
by Javi or one of his men.

1083
00:55:38,887 --> 00:55:40,519
What do you want me to do now?

1084
00:55:40,554 --> 00:55:41,722
I don't know.

1085
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,791
I'm still figuring that out.

1086
00:55:43,824 --> 00:55:46,661
But for now, why don't you
add a plotline to your movie

1087
00:55:46,693 --> 00:55:48,095
where someone gets kidnapped?

1088
00:55:48,128 --> 00:55:49,764
That way you can see

1089
00:55:49,797 --> 00:55:51,965
where he might,
theoretically, hide a hostage.

1090
00:55:51,999 --> 00:55:53,867
I'm working two jobs here.

1091
00:55:54,668 --> 00:55:55,702
Okay.

1092
00:55:57,703 --> 00:55:59,672
Vivian,

1093
00:55:59,705 --> 00:56:02,142
this is a grounded, adult drama

1094
00:56:02,174 --> 00:56:04,442
about two tough, sensitive men

1095
00:56:04,477 --> 00:56:05,879
and their unlikely friendship.

1096
00:56:05,913 --> 00:56:07,623
They're kind of like
dueling Christ figures.

1097
00:56:07,647 --> 00:56:11,183
Which is obviously a pretty
revolutionary idea in itself.

1098
00:56:11,218 --> 00:56:13,687
But what is not

1099
00:56:13,719 --> 00:56:16,689
a revolutionary
idea is a kidnapping.

1100
00:56:16,723 --> 00:56:18,558
And if I bring
that into the mix,

1101
00:56:18,591 --> 00:56:19,802
Javi's gonna know
something's up.

1102
00:56:19,826 --> 00:56:20,993
He's a hardliner for tone,

1103
00:56:21,027 --> 00:56:23,096
and this mission
will be blown. Okay?

1104
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,864
Jesus fucking Christ!

1105
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:28,835
You know, Nick,

1106
00:56:28,868 --> 00:56:30,203
I think a kidnapping

1107
00:56:30,236 --> 00:56:33,006
could give this
movie a wider appeal.

1108
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,607
I mean, it's pretty hard

1109
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,542
to find an audience
these days, right?

1110
00:56:36,576 --> 00:56:38,911
Unless you're a marvel movie,
<i>star wars,</i> whatever, yeah.

1111
00:56:38,946 --> 00:56:40,256
Yeah, doesn't
sound like this is that.

1112
00:56:40,279 --> 00:56:41,748
No, Vivian, it isn't.

1113
00:56:41,781 --> 00:56:43,917
This is an intelligent
film for grown-ups.

1114
00:56:43,951 --> 00:56:45,585
Now, personally,

1115
00:56:45,618 --> 00:56:49,589
I want a smart,
character-driven, adult drama

1116
00:56:49,623 --> 00:56:52,158
about real life, real people.

1117
00:56:52,192 --> 00:56:53,794
But the reality is,

1118
00:56:53,826 --> 00:56:56,562
most people need a bit of a hook

1119
00:56:56,596 --> 00:56:57,931
to get 'em into the theater.

1120
00:56:57,964 --> 00:56:59,632
Okay, now you're
talking about marketing.

1121
00:56:59,665 --> 00:57:01,201
And if you're talking
about marketing,

1122
00:57:01,234 --> 00:57:03,971
then, yes, you do need a
hook to get them into the theater.

1123
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:06,038
Well, get 'em into
the theater. Come on.

1124
00:57:06,073 --> 00:57:08,473
All you need is
a trailer moment.

1125
00:57:09,209 --> 00:57:10,475
Pull!

1126
00:57:13,879 --> 00:57:16,616
Hold on, hold on. Your
daughter gets kidnapped?

1127
00:57:16,649 --> 00:57:18,051
Yeah, it's a big trailer moment.

1128
00:57:18,085 --> 00:57:19,585
Hey, am I doing this right?

1129
00:57:19,618 --> 00:57:20,997
'Cause I had that
thing in my sights.

1130
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,089
But who kidnaps her?

1131
00:57:22,122 --> 00:57:23,589
Uh, maybe the barrel's warped.

1132
00:57:23,623 --> 00:57:24,634
The barrel is
definitely not warped.

1133
00:57:24,658 --> 00:57:25,658
Who kidnaps her?

1134
00:57:26,292 --> 00:57:27,660
Bad guys.

1135
00:57:28,661 --> 00:57:29,863
We both put our lives

1136
00:57:29,895 --> 00:57:31,007
on the line to save the daughter

1137
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:32,174
and become better men for it.

1138
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:33,767
It's classic.

1139
00:57:33,799 --> 00:57:34,844
It feels like a completely
different movie.

1140
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,203
Javi, please.

1141
00:57:36,236 --> 00:57:37,971
Just walk down the
road with me on this.

1142
00:57:38,004 --> 00:57:39,672
And then what?

1143
00:57:39,705 --> 00:57:42,776
The finale is about
two men saving the girl?

1144
00:57:42,808 --> 00:57:44,143
That's terrible.

1145
00:57:44,176 --> 00:57:45,645
Give me the gun.

1146
00:57:47,748 --> 00:57:49,515
You know the key
to shooting well?

1147
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:52,585
Controlling your breath.

1148
00:57:54,253 --> 00:57:56,188
And you know how to
control your breath, Nick?

1149
00:57:57,222 --> 00:57:58,624
Your heart.

1150
00:57:58,657 --> 00:58:01,260
Your heart must be still.

1151
00:58:01,293 --> 00:58:02,628
At peace.

1152
00:58:03,963 --> 00:58:05,664
My heart

1153
00:58:05,697 --> 00:58:07,099
is not still.

1154
00:58:07,133 --> 00:58:08,901
My heart

1155
00:58:08,934 --> 00:58:09,934
is not at peace.

1156
00:58:13,706 --> 00:58:14,874
Do you know why?

1157
00:58:14,907 --> 00:58:16,242
Hey, Javi.

1158
00:58:16,275 --> 00:58:18,778
If you're not gonna shoot,
maybe hand me the gun?

1159
00:58:18,811 --> 00:58:20,278
Because you're lying to me.

1160
00:58:20,311 --> 00:58:21,347
What?

1161
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:24,849
Don't fucking lie to me.

1162
00:58:24,883 --> 00:58:25,950
I'm not!

1163
00:58:25,985 --> 00:58:28,686
Don't fucking lie to me!

1164
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,322
Oh, my god, I'm not! I swear!

1165
00:58:30,356 --> 00:58:32,858
I know why you keep on
talking about this kidnapped girl.

1166
00:58:34,325 --> 00:58:35,927
You feel guilty about
your relationship

1167
00:58:35,961 --> 00:58:37,095
to your own daughter.

1168
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:41,267
Oh, my god, yes.

1169
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:43,869
A thousand times,
yes. You are blocked.

1170
00:58:43,903 --> 00:58:45,805
Creatively.

1171
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:47,173
Because you feel guilty

1172
00:58:47,206 --> 00:58:49,008
about what kind of
father you have been.

1173
00:58:49,041 --> 00:58:51,110
You're right. Yep.

1174
00:58:51,142 --> 00:58:52,177
You're 100% right.

1175
00:58:52,211 --> 00:58:53,278
Pull!

1176
00:59:13,331 --> 00:59:15,267
Vivian, what's going on?

1177
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,670
Nick, you need to get out
of that house immediately.

1178
00:59:17,702 --> 00:59:19,671
<i>The agency caught a
wiretap on our phones.</i>

1179
00:59:19,704 --> 00:59:21,340
<i>Then I picked up
a guy tailing me.</i>

1180
00:59:21,372 --> 00:59:23,943
If they've made me,
they've likely made you.

1181
00:59:23,976 --> 00:59:25,376
All right. Shit.

1182
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:27,646
<i>Nick, we can no longer
guarantee your safety.</i>

1183
00:59:29,715 --> 00:59:30,749
Jesus Christ!

1184
00:59:30,782 --> 00:59:32,050
You scared the hell out of me.

1185
00:59:32,084 --> 00:59:33,818
Nick,

1186
00:59:33,852 --> 00:59:35,253
I need you to come with me.

1187
00:59:37,755 --> 00:59:38,823
Right now?

1188
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:44,363
I'm sorry to have to
take this step, Nick.

1189
00:59:45,865 --> 00:59:48,300
You don't,
though. You really don't.

1190
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:50,034
No, it is the only option.

1191
00:59:51,469 --> 00:59:54,239
Can I just call
my family quickly?

1192
00:59:54,272 --> 00:59:55,806
Tell them I love them.

1193
00:59:56,341 --> 00:59:57,775
What?

1194
00:59:57,808 --> 00:59:59,777
There's no need to call them.

1195
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:00,844
They are here.

1196
01:00:02,112 --> 01:00:03,181
Dad. Nick.

1197
01:00:03,214 --> 01:00:04,281
Are you okay? What...

1198
01:00:04,315 --> 01:00:06,083
What the hell is going on?

1199
01:00:06,116 --> 01:00:07,217
Your friend called to say

1200
01:00:07,252 --> 01:00:09,053
you were so sick
you couldn't talk.

1201
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:10,955
We're worried about you. Yeah.

1202
01:00:10,989 --> 01:00:12,857
You wanna deal with me,
Javi? You deal with me.

1203
01:00:12,891 --> 01:00:14,292
But I'm begging you, please,

1204
01:00:14,324 --> 01:00:15,859
please leave my
family out of this.

1205
01:00:15,893 --> 01:00:17,103
Unfortunately, I can't do that.

1206
01:00:17,127 --> 01:00:18,228
You've left me no choice.

1207
01:00:18,263 --> 01:00:20,431
Are you dying, dad? Yes.

1208
01:00:20,464 --> 01:00:21,732
Oh, my god. What?

1209
01:00:21,766 --> 01:00:23,368
Creatively. Oh, come on.

1210
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,969
No, physically,
he is tremendous.

1211
01:00:25,002 --> 01:00:27,804
I mean, he will
probably outlive us all.

1212
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:29,440
So, you're not even sick?

1213
01:00:29,473 --> 01:00:30,875
I'm okay, honey.

1214
01:00:30,908 --> 01:00:32,710
I'm fine. I'm okay. Fuck you.

1215
01:00:32,743 --> 01:00:35,379
Look, I have grown to care
very deeply about your father.

1216
01:00:35,413 --> 01:00:36,980
And ex-husband.

1217
01:00:37,015 --> 01:00:38,382
We are working
on a movie together.

1218
01:00:38,415 --> 01:00:42,754
A beautiful
character-driven, adult drama.

1219
01:00:42,786 --> 01:00:46,891
But he has so many
unresolved issues with you

1220
01:00:46,924 --> 01:00:49,027
that it is beginning
to bleed into the work

1221
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:50,127
in a negative way.

1222
01:00:50,161 --> 01:00:51,328
Isn't that right, Nick?

1223
01:00:51,362 --> 01:00:53,897
Are you both out of
your fucking minds?

1224
01:00:53,931 --> 01:00:55,799
Well, you see, he
has so many regrets.

1225
01:00:55,833 --> 01:00:58,435
Yeah. Well, here is
another one to add to the list.

1226
01:00:58,469 --> 01:01:00,004
We've been on a plane.

1227
01:01:00,404 --> 01:01:02,040
All day!

1228
01:01:02,072 --> 01:01:03,241
I had to cancel clients.

1229
01:01:03,274 --> 01:01:04,942
We were panicking

1230
01:01:04,975 --> 01:01:05,909
because we couldn't find
anyone to feed the cats.

1231
01:01:05,944 --> 01:01:07,212
You know, they could be dead

1232
01:01:07,245 --> 01:01:09,013
by the time we get
home after this bullshit.

1233
01:01:09,047 --> 01:01:11,015
House smelling like a
dead cat. That's great.

1234
01:01:11,049 --> 01:01:12,417
That's fun.

1235
01:01:12,449 --> 01:01:14,252
Well, I had a cat die
in the kitchen once.

1236
01:01:15,453 --> 01:01:16,853
And my grandmother
was never able

1237
01:01:16,888 --> 01:01:18,188
to get rid of the smell.

1238
01:01:18,223 --> 01:01:19,857
I am very sorry for
the inconvenience,

1239
01:01:19,891 --> 01:01:21,359
but this is an emergency.

1240
01:01:21,391 --> 01:01:23,527
Have lunch with us.

1241
01:01:23,562 --> 01:01:25,263
And let him say
what he has to say.

1242
01:01:25,295 --> 01:01:27,031
Don't you think that's
a good idea, Nick?

1243
01:01:30,167 --> 01:01:33,504
Lunch is a wonderful idea, Javi.

1244
01:01:33,538 --> 01:01:36,873
And then, afterwards,
they can go home, right?

1245
01:01:39,009 --> 01:01:40,210
Great.

1246
01:01:40,245 --> 01:01:41,946
Let's have some fucking tapas.

1247
01:01:43,549 --> 01:01:45,049
This is so weird.

1248
01:01:45,083 --> 01:01:46,417
Yeah, well... that's...

1249
01:01:47,483 --> 01:01:48,852
What'd you expect?

1250
01:01:50,153 --> 01:01:52,956
I wanna apologize
to both of you.

1251
01:01:54,524 --> 01:01:56,892
I think I should have
been more present

1252
01:01:56,927 --> 01:01:59,028
while I was at home.

1253
01:01:59,061 --> 01:02:03,399
I didn't always need to
be focused on my work.

1254
01:02:03,432 --> 01:02:05,936
My face in a script.

1255
01:02:07,903 --> 01:02:11,108
But here's what I
keep coming back to.

1256
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:14,378
Would either of you
have wanted to prevent me

1257
01:02:14,410 --> 01:02:16,113
from living my artistic dreams?

1258
01:02:16,146 --> 01:02:18,881
Because I sure know I
wouldn't have wanted that

1259
01:02:18,914 --> 01:02:20,349
for either of you.

1260
01:02:24,153 --> 01:02:26,222
We flew to majorca for that?

1261
01:02:26,256 --> 01:02:27,858
Wow.

1262
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:29,425
That was fucking pathetic.

1263
01:02:29,459 --> 01:02:31,128
God, it really was, wasn't it?

1264
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,601
No, no, no. I am
honestly speechless.

1265
01:02:32,629 --> 01:02:35,332
Really? Because this
shit, you get used to it.

1266
01:02:35,365 --> 01:02:37,166
Yeah, that's pretty
much par for the course.

1267
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,235
Mmm-hmm.

1268
01:02:40,236 --> 01:02:42,472
Can't we just focus

1269
01:02:42,506 --> 01:02:45,309
on the good times
we did have together?

1270
01:02:45,341 --> 01:02:48,845
Addy, that trip we
took across the desert.

1271
01:02:48,878 --> 01:02:50,548
I never showed you this before,

1272
01:02:50,581 --> 01:02:52,550
but I keep this little
photo in my wallet

1273
01:02:52,582 --> 01:02:55,553
to remind me of
all the fun we had.

1274
01:02:56,352 --> 01:02:57,622
And, uh,

1275
01:02:57,655 --> 01:03:00,222
I know it wasn't great,

1276
01:03:00,256 --> 01:03:01,892
but that song...

1277
01:03:01,925 --> 01:03:04,595
I meant that moment
that I wrote in that song.

1278
01:03:04,628 --> 01:03:06,062
I meant it.

1279
01:03:06,095 --> 01:03:07,963
You didn't write it.

1280
01:03:07,997 --> 01:03:09,332
You got drunk
and you made it up,

1281
01:03:09,365 --> 01:03:10,635
because you couldn't stand

1282
01:03:10,668 --> 01:03:12,202
not being the
center of attention

1283
01:03:12,235 --> 01:03:13,336
for two fucking seconds.

1284
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:14,870
Addy.

1285
01:03:14,905 --> 01:03:17,474
Because everything
always has to be about you.

1286
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:20,209
What you like.

1287
01:03:20,242 --> 01:03:21,477
What books you've read.

1288
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:23,113
What movies you're into.

1289
01:03:23,146 --> 01:03:25,916
It's fucked up, you know?

1290
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:28,385
Like, I'm your daughter

1291
01:03:29,285 --> 01:03:31,387
and I get nervous.

1292
01:03:31,421 --> 01:03:33,624
Like, debilitating
fucking anxiety

1293
01:03:33,657 --> 01:03:35,425
that if I don't
like what you like,

1294
01:03:35,459 --> 01:03:37,526
you won't like me.

1295
01:03:37,561 --> 01:03:41,666
Addy, I was sharing the things
that were meaningful to me.

1296
01:03:41,698 --> 01:03:42,965
That were important to me.

1297
01:03:42,999 --> 01:03:45,167
No, you weren't. You weren't.

1298
01:03:45,201 --> 01:03:46,402
You were trying to mold me

1299
01:03:46,435 --> 01:03:48,069
into this little version of you.

1300
01:03:48,503 --> 01:03:50,005
Mold you?

1301
01:03:50,038 --> 01:03:52,340
Guide you. Addy, I love you.

1302
01:03:52,375 --> 01:03:55,545
I love you more than
anything in the world.

1303
01:03:55,578 --> 01:03:59,114
And I want you to
know I was trying.

1304
01:03:59,148 --> 01:04:00,982
I know. I know you were trying.

1305
01:04:01,685 --> 01:04:04,119
You're always trying.

1306
01:04:04,152 --> 01:04:06,389
Fuck, that's actually
the saddest part.

1307
01:04:12,527 --> 01:04:14,397
Shit.

1308
01:04:14,429 --> 01:04:16,790
I think we have more work
than I realized, but this is good.

1309
01:04:18,199 --> 01:04:19,603
This is very good.

1310
01:04:19,636 --> 01:04:21,503
This is a good first step.

1311
01:04:24,038 --> 01:04:25,974
Sorry to interrupt,
Mr. Gutierrez,

1312
01:04:26,007 --> 01:04:27,677
but you have a visitor.

1313
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:28,944
<i>Gracias.</i>

1314
01:04:33,415 --> 01:04:37,721
Oh! Hollywood Javi. There he is.

1315
01:04:42,324 --> 01:04:44,560
I have some news for you.

1316
01:04:44,594 --> 01:04:46,295
Javi Ford coppola.

1317
01:04:46,328 --> 01:04:48,096
Sit.

1318
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:49,297
Eat with me.

1319
01:05:02,411 --> 01:05:03,945
Froot Loops?

1320
01:05:05,581 --> 01:05:06,616
Delicious.

1321
01:05:08,083 --> 01:05:09,250
Taste it.

1322
01:05:13,522 --> 01:05:14,657
I love Froot Loops.

1323
01:05:24,299 --> 01:05:26,368
Sergio baldassari? Huh?

1324
01:05:57,298 --> 01:05:58,298
Hmm.

1325
01:06:09,611 --> 01:06:10,613
Yeah.

1326
01:06:14,816 --> 01:06:17,586
But I can't do a
deal with the Italians

1327
01:06:18,553 --> 01:06:20,220
if I am being betrayed.

1328
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:27,095
He flew my wife and daughter

1329
01:06:27,127 --> 01:06:28,172
all the way out to majorca.

1330
01:06:28,196 --> 01:06:29,229
My family!

1331
01:06:29,263 --> 01:06:30,330
Shit!

1332
01:06:30,365 --> 01:06:31,834
No, don't say "shit"!

1333
01:06:31,867 --> 01:06:33,769
You got us into this.
You get us out of this.

1334
01:06:33,801 --> 01:06:35,303
<i>There's no way</i>

1335
01:06:35,336 --> 01:06:37,171
we can mobilize
an extraction in time.

1336
01:06:37,205 --> 01:06:38,740
Then, what am I supposed to do?

1337
01:06:38,774 --> 01:06:41,441
If you can get Javi alone,
and then take him out,

1338
01:06:41,475 --> 01:06:43,778
<i>it'll buy the agency time
to get you all out of there.</i>

1339
01:06:43,812 --> 01:06:45,580
Do you have access to a firearm?

1340
01:06:46,814 --> 01:06:48,149
I might.

1341
01:06:48,182 --> 01:06:49,818
<i>Nick, I'm sorry,</i>

1342
01:06:49,852 --> 01:06:51,813
<i>but this is the best way
to safeguard your family.</i>

1343
01:06:56,658 --> 01:06:58,861
Listen, I need you
to be honest with me.

1344
01:06:58,894 --> 01:07:00,160
What the fuck is happening?

1345
01:07:00,193 --> 01:07:01,495
Okay.

1346
01:07:01,528 --> 01:07:03,131
I'm going to tell you something,

1347
01:07:03,164 --> 01:07:04,432
but please don't freak out.

1348
01:07:05,901 --> 01:07:08,102
I'm working for the CIA.

1349
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:13,852
Are you having a
nervous breakdown?

1350
01:07:13,876 --> 01:07:16,443
Probably. But I'm
telling you the truth.

1351
01:07:16,477 --> 01:07:18,557
They wanted some information
on Javi's business dealings

1352
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:20,180
so I've been helping them.

1353
01:07:20,213 --> 01:07:21,660
And the strange thing is,
it does kind of make sense

1354
01:07:21,684 --> 01:07:24,419
given that so much
of acting is like spying.

1355
01:07:24,452 --> 01:07:25,864
Do you have any
idea how this sounds?

1356
01:07:25,888 --> 01:07:28,122
'Cause I mean, it's
not... it's not good.

1357
01:07:28,155 --> 01:07:31,359
Okay, I need an hour to
do one final thing for them

1358
01:07:31,392 --> 01:07:32,861
and when I get back,

1359
01:07:32,894 --> 01:07:36,229
the three of us will fly to
Los Angeles together, okay?

1360
01:07:36,263 --> 01:07:38,197
I don't know what to say.

1361
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:40,867
Don't say anything. Just
take addy back to my room.

1362
01:07:40,902 --> 01:07:42,837
Don't talk to anyone.
Don't go anywhere.

1363
01:07:42,869 --> 01:07:44,706
I'll be back to get
you. I promise.

1364
01:07:44,739 --> 01:07:45,739
I love you.

1365
01:07:58,886 --> 01:08:01,521
Your friend, Nicolas cage,

1366
01:08:01,556 --> 01:08:03,422
the fucking star of Hollywood

1367
01:08:03,456 --> 01:08:05,592
is working for the
U.S. government.

1368
01:08:22,408 --> 01:08:23,911
Oh, bullshit!

1369
01:08:23,944 --> 01:08:25,311
Bullshit!

1370
01:08:25,345 --> 01:08:26,581
Bullshit!

1371
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:30,585
Bullshit!

1372
01:08:30,618 --> 01:08:31,719
Listen.

1373
01:08:34,788 --> 01:08:36,355
<i>I see myself doing more</i>

1374
01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:37,635
<i>of this stuff. You
know, spy craft.</i>

1375
01:08:37,658 --> 01:08:39,860
<i>Subterfuge. What have you.</i>

1376
01:08:39,894 --> 01:08:41,762
<i>I think I might
have a real gift for it.</i>

1377
01:08:41,796 --> 01:08:43,864
<i>Good, 'cause we
got another mission for you.</i>

1378
01:08:51,639 --> 01:08:52,873
No.

1379
01:08:52,907 --> 01:08:54,373
Lucas, no.

1380
01:09:03,016 --> 01:09:04,216
Lucas.

1381
01:09:17,899 --> 01:09:19,934
No! No, no, no!

1382
01:09:31,011 --> 01:09:33,747
I would love to
believe you, <i>primo.</i>

1383
01:09:34,947 --> 01:09:37,684
But either I kill you,

1384
01:09:37,718 --> 01:09:40,886
or you kill Nicolas cage.

1385
01:09:46,826 --> 01:09:48,227
Your choice.

1386
01:10:57,563 --> 01:10:58,564
Hi.

1387
01:10:59,532 --> 01:11:00,800
Hey.

1388
01:11:00,834 --> 01:11:03,603
I'm sorry.

1389
01:11:03,636 --> 01:11:06,505
I should have asked you
before bringing them down.

1390
01:11:07,406 --> 01:11:08,942
Yeah.

1391
01:11:08,974 --> 01:11:10,911
And I was thinking

1392
01:11:10,943 --> 01:11:13,679
maybe a kidnapping would work.

1393
01:11:13,712 --> 01:11:16,582
Our movie would start out
as a beautiful character piece

1394
01:11:16,616 --> 01:11:18,919
and then, slowly change
into a more thrilling...

1395
01:11:18,951 --> 01:11:21,086
Hollywood blockbuster.

1396
01:11:21,121 --> 01:11:24,691
Then there's
something for everyone.

1397
01:11:24,724 --> 01:11:26,792
Would you like to
drive out to the cliffs?

1398
01:11:29,094 --> 01:11:31,830
Clear our heads, and
think through the third act?

1399
01:11:32,998 --> 01:11:35,099
Perfect.

1400
01:11:54,085 --> 01:11:55,086
So...

1401
01:11:57,857 --> 01:11:58,891
We should go.

1402
01:11:59,758 --> 01:12:00,825
Yeah.

1403
01:12:08,666 --> 01:12:09,869
Are those new shoes?

1404
01:12:09,901 --> 01:12:10,936
These?

1405
01:12:10,969 --> 01:12:12,804
No, I've had these.

1406
01:12:12,838 --> 01:12:14,607
Oh.

1407
01:12:14,639 --> 01:12:16,040
I haven't seen them before.

1408
01:12:16,075 --> 01:12:17,474
I don't wear them very much.

1409
01:12:17,508 --> 01:12:18,753
I don't think they're really me.

1410
01:12:18,776 --> 01:12:20,012
What?

1411
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:22,147
They're great. They
look incredible on you.

1412
01:12:22,181 --> 01:12:24,616
They're totally you. Love 'em.

1413
01:12:24,650 --> 01:12:25,985
Do you wanna try them on?

1414
01:12:26,017 --> 01:12:27,553
I think they would
look amazing on you.

1415
01:12:30,155 --> 01:12:31,156
Oh, wow!

1416
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:34,893
Those look incredible on you.

1417
01:12:34,927 --> 01:12:36,861
I like how those
look on you. Yeah.

1418
01:12:39,865 --> 01:12:41,432
You wanna trade?

1419
01:12:41,465 --> 01:12:42,467
Like, permanently?

1420
01:12:44,501 --> 01:12:45,503
Okay.

1421
01:12:55,947 --> 01:12:57,148
Cool.

1422
01:13:01,586 --> 01:13:04,556
I'm really glad I
got to meet you.

1423
01:13:05,824 --> 01:13:07,860
You're the kind
of friend I could

1424
01:13:09,661 --> 01:13:13,065
not see for years, and
not even really talk to

1425
01:13:13,098 --> 01:13:15,465
and just pick up
right where we left off.

1426
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:16,735
I totally agree.

1427
01:13:17,635 --> 01:13:19,204
It's just...

1428
01:13:19,237 --> 01:13:20,539
Easy.

1429
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:34,185
Well...

1430
01:13:37,555 --> 01:13:38,856
I guess it's time to figure out

1431
01:13:38,890 --> 01:13:40,158
how this thing ends.

1432
01:13:56,908 --> 01:13:58,909
Nick...

1433
01:13:58,942 --> 01:14:00,912
I meant what I said back there.

1434
01:14:01,846 --> 01:14:02,946
Me, too.

1435
01:14:04,214 --> 01:14:06,116
Which is why this really hurts.

1436
01:14:08,151 --> 01:14:09,820
Javi.

1437
01:14:09,854 --> 01:14:12,056
You brought me out
here to kill me, man?

1438
01:14:12,089 --> 01:14:13,156
I'm sorry, Nick.

1439
01:14:13,191 --> 01:14:14,726
So am I.

1440
01:14:14,758 --> 01:14:16,761
'Cause you pull that
trigger and we're both dead.

1441
01:14:16,793 --> 01:14:19,864
Wait. You were gonna kill me?

1442
01:14:19,896 --> 01:14:21,699
And are those my golden guns?

1443
01:14:21,732 --> 01:14:24,302
They're my golden guns.

1444
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:26,547
And it looks like we both
had a little secret, doesn't it?

1445
01:14:26,570 --> 01:14:27,972
Why the fuck would you kill me?

1446
01:14:28,006 --> 01:14:29,807
You're the head of a
criminal organization.

1447
01:14:29,841 --> 01:14:32,744
My cousin Lucas is the
head of the organization.

1448
01:14:32,776 --> 01:14:34,712
CIA said you ran it.

1449
01:14:34,745 --> 01:14:36,981
The whole world thinks I run it.

1450
01:14:37,015 --> 01:14:39,583
When my father
died, Lucas took over.

1451
01:14:39,616 --> 01:14:41,218
He forced me to
be the figurehead.

1452
01:14:41,252 --> 01:14:42,619
You take his money.

1453
01:14:42,652 --> 01:14:44,888
You don't just leave
this world, Nick.

1454
01:14:44,922 --> 01:14:47,891
You and everyone you care
about is in constant danger.

1455
01:14:47,924 --> 01:14:49,694
Why do you think I
cannot be with Gabriela?

1456
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:52,629
You... you're into Gabriela?

1457
01:14:52,663 --> 01:14:53,964
Are you fucking kidding me?

1458
01:14:53,998 --> 01:14:55,600
I can't be with Gabriella,

1459
01:14:55,632 --> 01:14:56,877
because that would
put a target on her back.

1460
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:57,869
Wait, you seriously
didn't realize

1461
01:14:57,901 --> 01:14:58,835
that we liked each other?

1462
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:00,038
You're in the CIA!

1463
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:01,338
I'm not in the CIA.

1464
01:15:01,372 --> 01:15:04,775
I'm a goddamn
actor. You know that.

1465
01:15:04,808 --> 01:15:06,209
The only organization
I'm a part of

1466
01:15:06,244 --> 01:15:08,713
is the screen actors
guild of america.

1467
01:15:08,745 --> 01:15:10,257
And aftra. But I don't
even know what that is.

1468
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:12,226
I think it's a radio thing.
Just put down the gun.

1469
01:15:12,249 --> 01:15:14,118
No way. You go first.

1470
01:15:14,151 --> 01:15:15,729
I'm not going first. You
brought my family out here.

1471
01:15:15,753 --> 01:15:17,364
This is so fucked! I
don't wanna kill you.

1472
01:15:17,387 --> 01:15:18,890
You're the last
person I wanna kill.

1473
01:15:18,923 --> 01:15:20,891
I fucking love you! I love you!

1474
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:28,030
It's my cousin.

1475
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:29,175
He must have known
I wouldn't kill you.

1476
01:15:29,198 --> 01:15:30,633
I thought so.

1477
01:15:30,667 --> 01:15:32,034
Which is why I
should always trust

1478
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:34,070
my shamanic
instincts as a thespian.

1479
01:15:35,639 --> 01:15:37,774
Fuck!

1480
01:15:44,146 --> 01:15:46,248
Faster! I'm trying.

1481
01:15:46,283 --> 01:15:48,185
Your shoes don't
offer any ankle support.

1482
01:15:53,722 --> 01:15:55,225
Ah, fuck!

1483
01:16:00,163 --> 01:16:02,631
Okay. You just run out
there. You get the truck.

1484
01:16:02,666 --> 01:16:04,343
You come back and get
me. I will keep a lookout.

1485
01:16:04,367 --> 01:16:07,304
Uh-huh. Love it. Love the plan.

1486
01:16:07,337 --> 01:16:09,072
But given that you've saddled me

1487
01:16:09,105 --> 01:16:11,373
with what basically amounts
to fucking penny loafers

1488
01:16:11,408 --> 01:16:13,243
maybe you should
go, and I'll stay here.

1489
01:16:13,275 --> 01:16:14,978
I love that plan, I do.

1490
01:16:15,011 --> 01:16:17,079
But you are a faster
runner than me,

1491
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:18,782
even with subpar footwear.

1492
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:20,193
I saw how fast you were
in <i>national treasure.</i>

1493
01:16:20,216 --> 01:16:21,984
No, that'd be the
stunt department.

1494
01:16:22,017 --> 01:16:23,987
Not according to the
<i>making of</i> featurette.

1495
01:16:25,087 --> 01:16:27,791
Fine, I'll go. Wait!

1496
01:16:27,823 --> 01:16:29,725
So, you're gonna
go? I'm going with you.

1497
01:16:39,069 --> 01:16:40,069
There they are!

1498
01:16:53,115 --> 01:16:54,383
Ah, shit!

1499
01:16:57,953 --> 01:16:59,221
He's coming up on us.

1500
01:17:03,792 --> 01:17:05,028
On your left! On your left!

1501
01:17:08,097 --> 01:17:09,733
Holy shit!

1502
01:17:13,936 --> 01:17:15,438
Hit the brakes! What?

1503
01:17:15,471 --> 01:17:17,082
Hit the brakes. He will
hit the back of the truck.

1504
01:17:17,106 --> 01:17:18,317
That won't work.
Yes, it will. Yes, it will.

1505
01:17:18,341 --> 01:17:19,809
Just do it. Do it! Do it! Do it!

1506
01:17:24,212 --> 01:17:25,947
Don't worry, he's
totally passed out.

1507
01:17:27,148 --> 01:17:28,850
Fuck!

1508
01:17:32,453 --> 01:17:34,756
I'm okay. Are you okay?

1509
01:17:47,336 --> 01:17:48,836
Liv.

1510
01:17:48,871 --> 01:17:50,312
They took addy,
Nick. They took addy?

1511
01:17:50,339 --> 01:17:51,950
She went outside to find
you and they just grabbed her.

1512
01:17:51,974 --> 01:17:53,841
There are more soldiers
coming. We have to go.

1513
01:17:54,342 --> 01:17:55,344
Fuck!

1514
01:18:01,483 --> 01:18:03,318
Vivian? Hello.

1515
01:18:03,352 --> 01:18:04,153
<i>Nick, I've sent you the address.</i>

1516
01:18:04,185 --> 01:18:05,254
<i>You on the way?</i>

1517
01:18:05,287 --> 01:18:07,156
What? They have my daughter.

1518
01:18:07,189 --> 01:18:08,489
What do they want with her?

1519
01:18:08,523 --> 01:18:10,024
<i>Unfortunately, she's being used</i>

1520
01:18:10,059 --> 01:18:11,827
<i>to put pressure on
the U.S. government</i>

1521
01:18:11,859 --> 01:18:13,438
<i>so they'll back off their
support of delgado.</i>

1522
01:18:13,461 --> 01:18:16,264
<i>And unless delgado
drops out of the election...</i>

1523
01:18:16,297 --> 01:18:17,899
<i>Nick, I'm sorry,</i>

1524
01:18:17,933 --> 01:18:20,102
<i>but they said they're
gonna kill both girls.</i>

1525
01:18:21,103 --> 01:18:22,438
What? What? What?

1526
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:24,072
You're gonna get
him to drop out, right?

1527
01:18:24,105 --> 01:18:25,541
You're gonna get
him to drop out!

1528
01:18:25,574 --> 01:18:28,042
Just come directly here.

1529
01:19:24,365 --> 01:19:25,866
Oh, fucking...

1530
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:30,914
His people
could still be in the area.

1531
01:19:30,938 --> 01:19:32,406
We have to go. Where?

1532
01:19:32,439 --> 01:19:34,241
I have a place. Let's go.

1533
01:19:34,274 --> 01:19:35,714
Come, come. Come now.

1534
01:19:38,979 --> 01:19:40,616
So, what's the plan here?

1535
01:19:40,648 --> 01:19:44,352
You gonna be a big
hero? Save addy yourself?

1536
01:19:44,384 --> 01:19:46,521
You'll end up dead like her.

1537
01:19:46,554 --> 01:19:49,223
Leave it to the professionals.

1538
01:19:49,256 --> 01:19:51,058
Local police. Whomever.

1539
01:19:51,091 --> 01:19:52,492
There is no one else.

1540
01:19:55,996 --> 01:19:57,331
I love you.

1541
01:19:57,365 --> 01:19:59,366
And I have always
looked out for you.

1542
01:19:59,399 --> 01:20:01,201
Get off of me!

1543
01:20:01,235 --> 01:20:02,603
I have to go in there.

1544
01:20:02,638 --> 01:20:05,138
Because addy has to
know I fought for her.

1545
01:20:07,341 --> 01:20:10,077
I'm trying to help you,
and you won't listen!

1546
01:20:10,111 --> 01:20:11,879
How are you helping me, huh?

1547
01:20:11,912 --> 01:20:13,348
How are you ever helping me?

1548
01:20:15,282 --> 01:20:17,652
You need to know
who you are, Nick.

1549
01:20:17,686 --> 01:20:19,187
This isn't a role.

1550
01:20:19,219 --> 01:20:21,054
You're not a hero.

1551
01:20:21,089 --> 01:20:22,466
<i>You're just some guy
who's about to get us killed.</i>

1552
01:20:22,490 --> 01:20:24,192
<i>You fucking idiot!</i>

1553
01:20:37,606 --> 01:20:39,406
I bought this house 20 years ago

1554
01:20:39,439 --> 01:20:41,643
for a situation just like this.

1555
01:20:41,677 --> 01:20:44,077
It has everything we
need. Food, passports,

1556
01:20:44,112 --> 01:20:45,613
materials for disguise.

1557
01:20:46,714 --> 01:20:48,081
We'll be safe for the night.

1558
01:20:52,286 --> 01:20:53,655
Olivia,

1559
01:20:53,688 --> 01:20:55,490
I promise you will get
your daughter back.

1560
01:21:07,034 --> 01:21:08,369
The girls are likely being held

1561
01:21:08,402 --> 01:21:10,004
in my cousin's compound.

1562
01:21:10,036 --> 01:21:12,072
It is a monastery that
they use as a cover,

1563
01:21:12,106 --> 01:21:13,608
but it is a fortress.

1564
01:21:13,642 --> 01:21:15,642
It is impenetrable. There
are walls on every side.

1565
01:21:15,676 --> 01:21:17,009
Any escape routes?

1566
01:21:17,043 --> 01:21:18,945
Tunnels. But with metal doors

1567
01:21:18,978 --> 01:21:20,548
that only open from the inside.

1568
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:22,057
Even if it weren't for
all of the armed guards,

1569
01:21:22,081 --> 01:21:24,017
it is impossible to get in.

1570
01:21:24,049 --> 01:21:26,419
I mean, this psychopath
is gonna kill our daughter

1571
01:21:26,453 --> 01:21:27,588
in 12 hours.

1572
01:21:27,621 --> 01:21:29,557
So, what the fuck
are we gonna do?

1573
01:21:37,664 --> 01:21:41,133
We are going to walk straight
in through the front gate.

1574
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:46,106
Okay, cool. Very
dramatic answer.

1575
01:21:46,138 --> 01:21:48,275
How's that supposed to work?

1576
01:21:48,307 --> 01:21:49,385
Lucas is trying
to form an alliance

1577
01:21:49,409 --> 01:21:50,710
with Sergio baldassari,

1578
01:21:50,745 --> 01:21:52,579
the head of the
calabero crime family.

1579
01:21:52,612 --> 01:21:55,650
Baldassari, I mean, no one
has seen him for 15 years.

1580
01:21:55,682 --> 01:21:59,518
Exactly. And since
no one has seen him

1581
01:21:59,553 --> 01:22:02,289
no one knows exactly
what he looks like.

1582
01:22:02,321 --> 01:22:03,624
Olivia.

1583
01:22:03,658 --> 01:22:04,701
Nick says that you
were an incredible

1584
01:22:04,725 --> 01:22:06,392
makeup artist when you met.

1585
01:22:06,426 --> 01:22:09,428
So, with some prosthetics
and a little makeup...

1586
01:22:09,463 --> 01:22:11,397
Then I could play Sergio.

1587
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:28,347
Lucas Gutierrez!

1588
01:22:33,085 --> 01:22:34,789
I'd like to introduce
my wife Barbara.

1589
01:22:34,821 --> 01:22:38,424
Why for? She was born in
Santa Barbara, California.

1590
01:22:41,728 --> 01:22:44,664
You think I'm fucking
stupid, Sergio, hmm?

1591
01:22:44,699 --> 01:22:47,267
You think you're just gonna
walk in here after 15 years

1592
01:22:47,299 --> 01:22:48,736
and kill me,

1593
01:22:48,768 --> 01:22:50,402
you motherfucker, hmm?

1594
01:22:50,437 --> 01:22:51,615
He's cutting my fucking ear off!

1595
01:22:51,638 --> 01:22:53,440
Who are you working
for? Three seconds.

1596
01:22:53,472 --> 01:22:55,241
It's just me! Two!

1597
01:22:55,275 --> 01:22:56,308
I promise!

1598
01:23:00,513 --> 01:23:03,182
You think she can
help you, Sergio, hmm?

1599
01:23:04,785 --> 01:23:06,587
Go ahead.

1600
01:23:06,620 --> 01:23:09,321
You kill him, I'll
still make the deal.

1601
01:23:09,356 --> 01:23:11,057
But I don't think
you're gonna kill him.

1602
01:23:12,758 --> 01:23:14,561
You don't think I'll kill him?

1603
01:23:14,593 --> 01:23:16,071
No, I think if you
were gonna kill him,

1604
01:23:16,095 --> 01:23:17,631
you would have done it by now.

1605
01:23:17,663 --> 01:23:19,364
So, no, I don't
think you'll do it.

1606
01:23:21,568 --> 01:23:23,770
Although, I am wondering

1607
01:23:23,802 --> 01:23:26,404
why the fuck you think
you can intimidate me?

1608
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:31,142
Okay, Barbara
from Santa Barbara.

1609
01:23:31,176 --> 01:23:32,244
Okay, Barbara.

1610
01:23:33,812 --> 01:23:35,782
It is good to see you, Sergio.

1611
01:23:35,815 --> 01:23:37,315
Been far too long.

1612
01:23:37,349 --> 01:23:38,584
You okay?

1613
01:23:38,618 --> 01:23:40,686
My people will
show you to a room.

1614
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:44,189
Freshen up, and
then, we'll talk.

1615
01:23:44,222 --> 01:23:47,627
God, how does my ear
look? He almost cut off my ear.

1616
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:49,203
Shit! We've only got
about 15 minutes, Nick.

1617
01:23:49,227 --> 01:23:50,596
We've gotta go find addy.

1618
01:23:50,629 --> 01:23:52,407
I know. I know.
According to Javi's map,

1619
01:23:52,431 --> 01:23:53,833
they're probably holding her

1620
01:23:53,867 --> 01:23:55,548
in the basement of
the building right here.

1621
01:24:05,276 --> 01:24:06,278
You ready?

1622
01:24:23,261 --> 01:24:24,262
What do we do?

1623
01:24:30,502 --> 01:24:31,502
Oh, good one.

1624
01:24:36,342 --> 01:24:37,342
Get his gun.

1625
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:42,381
Drop the gun, Sergio.

1626
01:24:46,552 --> 01:24:48,486
Neither of you are
supposed to be here.

1627
01:24:49,454 --> 01:24:50,521
Come with me.

1628
01:24:57,763 --> 01:24:58,765
Lucas.

1629
01:25:07,873 --> 01:25:08,907
A gun?

1630
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:10,375
Okay, Sergio.

1631
01:25:10,408 --> 01:25:12,310
What's the deal, my man?

1632
01:25:12,342 --> 01:25:13,746
You got a fucking problem

1633
01:25:13,778 --> 01:25:15,948
you'd like to tell
me about or...

1634
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:18,617
I was beginning to think
you don't have the girl

1635
01:25:18,650 --> 01:25:22,755
and since our deal was based
on delgado dropping out...

1636
01:25:22,787 --> 01:25:24,188
- He'll drop out.
- Fuck.

1637
01:25:24,221 --> 01:25:25,523
But he hasn't done it yet.

1638
01:25:25,556 --> 01:25:27,257
Lucas.

1639
01:25:33,732 --> 01:25:35,198
- Lucas!
- Now!

1640
01:25:36,835 --> 01:25:37,836
Okay.

1641
01:25:41,006 --> 01:25:42,808
You know,

1642
01:25:42,841 --> 01:25:47,211
if you and I are gonna be
in business together, Sergio,

1643
01:25:47,244 --> 01:25:48,913
you're gonna need to trust me.

1644
01:25:49,547 --> 01:25:50,549
Hmm?

1645
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:57,320
What the fuck?

1646
01:25:57,354 --> 01:25:58,488
What the fuck, what?

1647
01:25:58,523 --> 01:25:59,658
Oh, shit.

1648
01:25:59,692 --> 01:26:01,659
Your face...

1649
01:26:01,693 --> 01:26:04,261
Oh, shit! I'll blow
his fucking head off, man!

1650
01:26:04,295 --> 01:26:06,665
Don't fucking move!

1651
01:26:06,698 --> 01:26:08,000
Olivia, take the girls and go.

1652
01:26:08,033 --> 01:26:09,500
What's the plan here, Nick?

1653
01:26:09,534 --> 01:26:11,903
You get the girls
out of here alive!

1654
01:26:11,936 --> 01:26:13,906
No, we can't just
leave him here.

1655
01:26:13,939 --> 01:26:15,406
Addy, go with your mom!

1656
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:16,474
Hey! Just go. Go!

1657
01:26:16,506 --> 01:26:17,943
Come on.

1658
01:26:17,975 --> 01:26:19,912
Just run, addy.

1659
01:26:21,412 --> 01:26:23,480
You like that? Huh?

1660
01:26:23,514 --> 01:26:25,016
Oh, my god. Nick fucking cage.

1661
01:26:25,050 --> 01:26:26,885
Nick motherfucking cage!

1662
01:26:26,918 --> 01:26:28,753
Don't even think about it!

1663
01:26:32,355 --> 01:26:33,658
Okay, this way. Come on.

1664
01:26:35,326 --> 01:26:36,327
Come on.

1665
01:26:38,997 --> 01:26:40,565
Now, go!

1666
01:26:40,599 --> 01:26:41,867
Wait!

1667
01:26:41,899 --> 01:26:42,935
Where's Nick?

1668
01:26:42,967 --> 01:26:45,002
He's got a gun on Lucas.

1669
01:26:45,037 --> 01:26:46,872
He bought us some
time, but there's others.

1670
01:26:46,904 --> 01:26:48,940
He will never make
it out of there alive.

1671
01:26:53,845 --> 01:26:55,913
Here's what I know, Nick cage.

1672
01:26:55,948 --> 01:27:00,818
I've got four guys with guns
pointed directly at your head.

1673
01:27:00,853 --> 01:27:04,387
Yeah, that's true. But
here's what I know.

1674
01:27:04,421 --> 01:27:05,990
My family's safe.

1675
01:27:06,023 --> 01:27:07,224
And that's all that matters.

1676
01:27:10,827 --> 01:27:12,528
Hey!

1677
01:27:12,563 --> 01:27:13,997
There he is.

1678
01:27:14,031 --> 01:27:15,767
There he fucking is!

1679
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,535
The American hero.

1680
01:27:17,934 --> 01:27:19,435
Oh!

1681
01:27:19,469 --> 01:27:22,505
The fucking star
of Hollywood, eh?

1682
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:26,076
Ooh, whoa. Come
on. What is this?

1683
01:27:26,109 --> 01:27:28,679
And this nose, yeah?

1684
01:27:28,712 --> 01:27:30,014
Don't fucking move!

1685
01:27:30,046 --> 01:27:32,415
Jesus Christ! This
fucking guy again.

1686
01:27:32,448 --> 01:27:33,483
Carlos.

1687
01:27:35,051 --> 01:27:37,087
Carlos, please. You
don't wanna do this to me.

1688
01:27:37,121 --> 01:27:38,790
You don't wanna do this to Javi.

1689
01:27:38,822 --> 01:27:41,591
He's been nothing
but good to you.

1690
01:27:41,625 --> 01:27:42,759
Javi is about to die.

1691
01:27:43,527 --> 01:27:45,495
As are you.

1692
01:27:45,528 --> 01:27:46,997
Shit!

1693
01:27:47,031 --> 01:27:49,567
Anything you'd like
to say before you die?

1694
01:27:51,401 --> 01:27:54,437
"It takes 13 milliseconds
for the human brain"

1695
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:55,749
"to send a message to the body."

1696
01:27:55,773 --> 01:27:57,774
"So, by the time
your bullets hit me,"

1697
01:27:57,809 --> 01:28:00,710
"my cerebral cortex will
be transmittin' a signal"

1698
01:28:00,745 --> 01:28:02,612
"to the 17 healthy muscles"

1699
01:28:02,647 --> 01:28:05,582
"that operate
my trigger finger."

1700
01:28:05,616 --> 01:28:08,920
"And before your asshole
has a chance to pucker up,"

1701
01:28:08,952 --> 01:28:11,388
"your medulla oblongata
will be splattered"

1702
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:14,523
"all over the fucking
wall behind ya!"

1703
01:28:14,559 --> 01:28:16,993
"And if that's the last
thing I accomplish"

1704
01:28:17,027 --> 01:28:18,962
"on this beautiful green earth,"

1705
01:28:18,996 --> 01:28:21,933
"well, then, ha, I say, ha..."

1706
01:28:21,965 --> 01:28:24,535
"What a way to fucking go."

1707
01:28:27,604 --> 01:28:28,673
Hey!

1708
01:28:31,608 --> 01:28:33,611
Shit, come on! Nick, go! Go!

1709
01:28:39,116 --> 01:28:40,483
Did we kill him?

1710
01:28:45,656 --> 01:28:47,389
Shit!

1711
01:28:47,424 --> 01:28:49,660
You're dead.

1712
01:28:49,693 --> 01:28:51,027
All of you!

1713
01:29:00,537 --> 01:29:01,973
Nicolas cage?

1714
01:29:04,607 --> 01:29:06,610
That's fucking cool.

1715
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:13,116
Addy... addy, did
he... did he hurt you?

1716
01:29:13,148 --> 01:29:14,750
Better not have. No.

1717
01:29:14,784 --> 01:29:16,186
Are you hungry? No.

1718
01:29:16,218 --> 01:29:18,855
Javi has apples. You want
a McIntosh? Honey crisp?

1719
01:29:18,888 --> 01:29:20,455
No apples, Nick.

1720
01:29:20,489 --> 01:29:21,456
Dad, just please,
watch the road. Please!

1721
01:29:21,490 --> 01:29:22,758
Oh, shit!

1722
01:29:28,665 --> 01:29:29,999
Oh, shit!

1723
01:29:31,034 --> 01:29:32,035
Oh.

1724
01:29:38,008 --> 01:29:39,819
Olivia, hand me the
guns. They're right in there.

1725
01:29:39,843 --> 01:29:41,076
What are you doing?

1726
01:29:41,777 --> 01:29:43,178
No.

1727
01:29:43,213 --> 01:29:44,489
Okay, stop the truck.
I will slow them down.

1728
01:29:44,513 --> 01:29:45,848
No way! Yes.

1729
01:29:45,882 --> 01:29:47,516
You are two kilometers
from the embassy.

1730
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:48,694
If I slow them down,
then you will all make it.

1731
01:29:48,718 --> 01:29:49,762
- Javi, I can get us there.
- No!

1732
01:29:49,785 --> 01:29:50,946
Just stay in the truck! Javs!

1733
01:29:54,790 --> 01:29:55,825
No!

1734
01:29:55,858 --> 01:29:57,526
Just get in the car, Javi!

1735
01:30:01,130 --> 01:30:02,665
I'm never gonna
have any kind of a life

1736
01:30:02,699 --> 01:30:04,867
unless I stand up to my cousin!

1737
01:30:06,769 --> 01:30:07,836
I need this.

1738
01:30:09,004 --> 01:30:10,072
Now, go.

1739
01:30:11,607 --> 01:30:12,608
Go!

1740
01:30:21,151 --> 01:30:22,151
You stayed.

1741
01:30:22,885 --> 01:30:24,019
Of course.

1742
01:31:01,256 --> 01:31:03,624
Don't worry, addy.
Everyone's gonna be okay.

1743
01:31:03,659 --> 01:31:05,093
How's Maria doing? She's okay.

1744
01:31:05,127 --> 01:31:06,294
Dad, please go faster.

1745
01:31:06,328 --> 01:31:07,529
Yeah. Take this left here.

1746
01:31:23,645 --> 01:31:24,812
Shit!

1747
01:31:32,021 --> 01:31:34,155
Oh!

1748
01:31:36,891 --> 01:31:38,694
Oh!

1749
01:31:48,369 --> 01:31:51,606
Did we lose 'em?
I think we lost 'em.

1750
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:53,208
Dad, watch out! Olivia: Oh!

1751
01:31:59,248 --> 01:32:01,549
- Oh!
- Oh, my god.

1752
01:32:23,806 --> 01:32:26,074
I'm gonna kill you,
Nick fucking cage!

1753
01:32:28,910 --> 01:32:30,646
Get down! Everybody get down!

1754
01:32:35,116 --> 01:32:36,150
Hold on!

1755
01:32:53,668 --> 01:32:54,837
What just happened?

1756
01:32:55,735 --> 01:32:57,171
Addy?

1757
01:32:57,204 --> 01:32:58,372
Come out! Gun!

1758
01:32:58,405 --> 01:32:59,640
Come on!

1759
01:33:04,145 --> 01:33:05,746
Don't you move!

1760
01:33:07,814 --> 01:33:11,152
Get back! Get back!

1761
01:33:11,185 --> 01:33:12,653
Come near me and
I'm gonna kill him.

1762
01:33:12,686 --> 01:33:13,887
Addy?

1763
01:33:16,056 --> 01:33:17,124
Dad!

1764
01:33:29,837 --> 01:33:31,271
We made it, Nick.

1765
01:33:34,841 --> 01:33:36,109
We made it.

1766
01:33:37,845 --> 01:33:38,980
All of us.

1767
01:33:42,149 --> 01:33:43,950
I love you, daddy.

1768
01:34:35,336 --> 01:34:37,471
"I love you, daddy"?

1769
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:39,140
Javi wrote that. Okay.

1770
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:41,508
Congratulations.

1771
01:34:41,542 --> 01:34:42,877
Thanks, Olivia.

1772
01:34:46,447 --> 01:34:47,480
We're back.

1773
01:34:47,515 --> 01:34:49,115
Not that we went anywhere.

1774
01:34:49,149 --> 01:34:50,417
Not that we went anywhere.

1775
01:35:01,528 --> 01:35:03,129
Thanks. Oh, thanks.

1776
01:35:06,398 --> 01:35:08,068
Nick.

1777
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:09,501
Javi, I've been looking for you.

1778
01:35:09,537 --> 01:35:11,071
I was wondering where you went.

1779
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:13,340
Oh, no, I couldn't
watch. I was, uh...

1780
01:35:13,372 --> 01:35:15,242
I was too nervous.

1781
01:35:15,274 --> 01:35:16,443
How did it play?

1782
01:35:16,475 --> 01:35:19,045
They loved it. Congratulations.

1783
01:35:19,078 --> 01:35:20,412
Really? Yeah.

1784
01:35:20,447 --> 01:35:21,947
Oh, wow!

1785
01:35:23,015 --> 01:35:24,350
This is...

1786
01:35:24,384 --> 01:35:25,385
Nick...

1787
01:35:26,252 --> 01:35:27,555
Thank you.

1788
01:35:27,587 --> 01:35:29,989
Javi, we did this
together. Thank you.

1789
01:35:30,023 --> 01:35:32,024
Do you wanna ride
to the party with me?

1790
01:35:32,058 --> 01:35:34,928
They want to interview
us. Uh, <i>vanity fair.</i>

1791
01:35:37,897 --> 01:35:40,000
Yeah, no, I can't
tonight. But you go.

1792
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:42,402
Have fun. Enjoy this.

1793
01:35:42,434 --> 01:35:44,270
And give Gabriela my love.

1794
01:35:49,876 --> 01:35:51,545
Addy wants to borrow your belt.

1795
01:35:51,578 --> 01:35:53,046
Oh, yeah, I do.

1796
01:35:53,078 --> 01:35:55,081
It looks like it's
got some weight.

1797
01:35:55,114 --> 01:35:57,416
Well, yeah, it's a
big, fat tarantula.

1798
01:35:57,449 --> 01:35:59,085
You know my dresser, Jeff.

1799
01:35:59,118 --> 01:36:00,287
Mr. Neiman Marcus? Yes.

1800
01:36:00,319 --> 01:36:01,955
He wanted me to wear a bee.

1801
01:36:01,988 --> 01:36:03,857
And I said, "Jeff, not
the bees. Not the bees".

1802
01:36:03,889 --> 01:36:05,401
So, he said, "well, how
about a scorpion?" I said,

1803
01:36:05,425 --> 01:36:06,936
"I think a scorpion is a
little aggressive, Jeff."

1804
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:08,094
"What about a tarantula?"

1805
01:36:08,127 --> 01:36:09,395
He goes, "well, I don't think"

1806
01:36:09,429 --> 01:36:10,607
"that's any less
aggressive, Nick."

1807
01:36:10,630 --> 01:36:11,871
And I say, "well, it is to me."

1808
01:36:11,898 --> 01:36:12,942
They're cute and fuzzy, right?

1809
01:36:12,965 --> 01:36:14,076
Well, addy wants to borrow it.

1810
01:36:14,099 --> 01:36:15,603
Not at all.

1811
01:36:15,635 --> 01:36:17,370
You can have it. It's yours.

1812
01:36:17,403 --> 01:36:19,906
Are you sure you didn't
need to stay at the premiere?

1813
01:36:19,938 --> 01:36:22,007
Hundred percent. Yeah?

1814
01:36:22,041 --> 01:36:23,184
Who chose Demi
Moore to play mom?

1815
01:36:23,208 --> 01:36:24,978
Studio.

1816
01:36:25,010 --> 01:36:27,246
But it doesn't really do
your mother justice, does it?

1817
01:36:27,279 --> 01:36:28,447
Oh, come on.

1818
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:29,582
She's gorgeous.

1819
01:36:29,617 --> 01:36:30,983
So are you, Olivia.

1820
01:36:31,016 --> 01:36:33,252
Ew, dad, stop hitting on mom.

1821
01:36:33,286 --> 01:36:34,953
I'm not hitting on her.

1822
01:36:34,988 --> 01:36:37,389
Oh, gross. I don't wanna
listen to this anymore.

1823
01:36:37,424 --> 01:36:39,458
You know what? What do
you say we watch a movie?

1824
01:36:39,492 --> 01:36:41,461
Yeah, whatever you want, dad.

1825
01:36:41,493 --> 01:36:42,961
No, really. You choose.

1826
01:36:44,264 --> 01:36:45,497
Really?

1827
01:36:45,532 --> 01:36:47,535
Yeah, show us
something you like.

1828
01:36:47,568 --> 01:36:49,169
This is...

1829
01:36:49,202 --> 01:36:51,370
Have you ever seen <i>Paddington 2?</i>

1830
01:37:37,650 --> 01:37:39,084
<i>You're Nick</i>

1831
01:37:39,117 --> 01:37:41,387
<i>fucking...</i>

1832
01:37:47,626 --> 01:37:49,428
<i>Whoa! Cage!</i>
