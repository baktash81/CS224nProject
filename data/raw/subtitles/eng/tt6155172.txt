So that kid

Then an army jeep drove by,

34
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,269
the kid throws a balloon at it,
the solider gets mad,

35
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,813
he gets out, and shoots him.

36
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,315

37
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,859
He shot him in the head. He's dead.

180
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,778
I owe my life to martial arts.

181
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,406
I grew up with nothing.

182
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:20,996
My mother died when I was a kid.

183
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,210
I moved with my aunt to the slums.

184
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:29,379
There, my cousins beat me.

185
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,590
And I met the wrong crowd.

186
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,510
And I started drinking, and then huffing.

187
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,386
I was dying.

188
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,600
But then I discovered martial arts.

189
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,938
And everything came into...

190
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,525
focus.

191
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,405
Just like when you look at me.

192
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,782
Borras.

193
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:38,550
<i>♪ [ Kitty, kitty, sleepy kitty cat ] ♪</i>

197
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,276
Good morning, my princess.

198
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,528
Morning, Cleo.

199
00:28:58,612 --> 00:28:59,863
Time to wake up.

200
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,326
- I need to pee.
- Okay.

201
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,375
- Good morning, Sofi.
- Good morning, Grandma.

202
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:21,885
Paco.

203
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,179
Wake up, my angel.

204
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:26,556
Come on.

205
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:29,226
Paco.

206
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,520
It's time.

207
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:48,662
Let's see.

208
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:22,195
- I want one!
- They're mine.

209
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:26,116
- I got them for everyone.
- But I put them in the freezer.

210
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:29,995
Give Sofi one and I'll get you a box.

211
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,962
Hurry up, kids. It's 7:20.

212
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:40,797
Nah-uh, it's 7:17.

213
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:46,053
Here. Get fatter.

214
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:47,763
- Turn that off!
- No!

215
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:50,015
- Turn it off!
- Okay, I'll turn it off.

216
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:53,018
- Cleo, hold the dog.
- Yes, ma'am.

217
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,479
- Get out of my way!
- You get out of my way!

218
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,897
Shotgun!

219
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:05,155
- Put on Radio Exitos!
- I'm up front. I choose.

220
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,120
- Be careful.
- Move over.

221
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:16,124
- Change the station!
- No, it's Creedence vs. Beatles.

222
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:20,379
- Move!
- Calm down, for God's sake!

223
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:25,300
You choose when it's your turn.

224
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:27,803
- Settle down.
- Shut up.

225
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,806
- I'm not going to shut up.
- You too, quiet!

226
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,358
Come.

227
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:59,126
When I was old, you were there,
but you were someone else.

228
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,254
When you were old?

229
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,296
Yes.

230
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:06,216
Or when you get old?

231
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,051
No, when I was old.

232
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:11,805
And when was that?

233
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,141
Before I was born.

234
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,144
And what did you do then?

235
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:20,063
I was a pilot.

236
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,817
- A pilot?
- Yes, a fighter pilot.

237
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,569
Did you like it?

238
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,320
No, it was scary.

239
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:32,325
Was it? I'll be right back.

240
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,709
- [ Good evening. ]
- [ Why didn't you wake me? ]

241
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,795
God forbid you'll get tired.

242
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:46,548
- Prepare Dr. Antonio's oatmeal.
- Ah.

243
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:47,966
My love.

244
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:54,389
- Mom!
- Good morning!

245
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,518
You're almost done.

246
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:01,980
Your juice.

247
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:05,400
Pepe will wait to say goodbye to Daddy.

248
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,570
- It's fine if he's late.
- Yes, ma'am.

249
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,698
- I'll take the bags, Doctor.
- Thanks.

250
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,992
- Hi, Daddy!
- Your oatmeal is ready, Doctor.

251
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,953
Pepe waited to say goodbye.

252
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,663
Morning, Pepón!

253
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,790
Yuck! Cigarette!

254
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:49,528
- Damn...
- Mom, Daddy stepped on dog poo.

255
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:52,113
- Let me help you, Cleo.
- Thank you, Doctor.

256
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,916
- Bye, Pepón!
- Bye, Daddy.

257
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,460
- Take care.
- You too.

258
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,171
- Go with Cleo.
- Yes, Mom.

259
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,229
We'll be here.

260
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,439
It's just a few weeks.

261
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,884
Goddammit! I told you
to clean up the dog shit!

262
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:39,638
I'll take him. Come on.

263
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,765
- Bye, Cleo!
- Bye.

264
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,432
Hey, I have to...

265
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,867
It's just that, I'm late.

266
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:41,926
I think I'm pregnant.

267
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:47,766
Ah, well...

268
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,436
That's good, right?

269
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,354
Yes?

270
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:58,401
Yeah.

271
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:23,676
I need the bathroom.

272
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,971
But it's almost over.

273
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,432
Yes, but I have to go now.
I won't be long.

274
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,434
- Want an ice cream?
- No.

275
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:42,523
No strings! No tricks!

276
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:55,703
Boom! Bones is dead!

277
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:10,635
<i>♪ It's raining, it's pouring</i>
<i>The old man is snoring ♪</i>

278
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:51,801
[ Manita. You take it. ]

279
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,178
[ Don't be afraid. ]

280
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,562
And when they ask about their dad?

281
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,981
Say he's on a business trip.

282
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,357
Right.

283
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,448
Thank you, Cleo.

284
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:15,825
Thank you, Cleo.

285
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:21,831
Mrs. Sofi? When you have a minute,
can we talk?

286
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:26,794
Sure, but just call the kids first.

287
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,171
Okay.

288
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:34,802
- Stay calm.
- Paco, Toño, your mom is calling you!

289
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:39,098
You have to be strong
for the children.

290
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:40,391
Okay, Mom.

291
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:47,231
Sofi, Pepe,
your mother is calling you.

292
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:50,651
Sofi!

293
00:42:54,739 --> 00:43:00,119
Come, sweetie. We'll come back after.

294
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,345
Oh, wet hair!

295
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,432
- I got more hail than Sofi!
- I got more than Pepe!

296
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:24,102
- No, I got more.
- You both have the same.

297
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:27,480
- I'm going to the stationer's.
- You can go later.

298
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:28,731
Sit down, Cleo.

299
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,399
I have news.

300
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:33,236
- We're going to Disneyland!
- Yeah, Disneyland!

301
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:36,864
No. We're spending Christmas
at your uncle's.

302
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:42,120
- It's so boring there!
- No it isn't, my cousins are there!

303
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:44,789
And New Year's we'll go
to the Bárcenas' hacienda.

304
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,958
- Are the Richards going?
- Yes.

305
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:50,920
- And the Matos family, and the Larssons.
- When's Dad coming?

306
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:56,634
His research is keeping him in Quebec
a little longer.

307
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,845
- Until January?
- He doesn't know.

308
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:03,766
But I brought paper
so you can write him a letter. Mmm?

309
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,434
Write him-- Hey!

310
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:09,438
Tell him that you love him
and to please come home soon.

311
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:10,857
I'm going to the store.

312
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,776
You're not going anywhere
until you're done with your letter.

313
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:16,737
- Where are you going?
- Can't I write it in my room?

314
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:17,655
No!

315
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,409
Sure. Go to your room.

316
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,994
Then I'm going up, too.

317
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:34,714
Sofi, help Pepe write his letter
at the table.

318
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,674
I need to talk with Cleo.

319
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:40,052
Help him write, ''I miss you a lot, Dad."

320
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:43,389
- Make lots of pretty drawings.
- Let's go, Pepe.

321
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:44,807
Let's go, Pepe.

322
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,646
Wait, Sofi!

323
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,734
Come, Cleo.

324
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:00,698
What's up?

325
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:04,285
What is it?

326
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:06,871
Are you all right?

327
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:11,292
- Yes.
- Sure? What's wrong?

328
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,295
Is your mom all right?

329
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:16,839
- Yes.
- Yes?

330
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:19,508
Oh, Mrs. Sofi...

331
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:21,844
What's wrong?

332
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:26,098
It's just that I think I'm pregnant.

333
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,853
What do you mean you ''think''?

334
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:33,773
I haven't gotten my period.

335
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:36,609
Since when?

336
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:38,694
I don't know...

337
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,115
Who's the father?

338
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:46,494
Fermín. The cousin of Adela's boyfriend.

339
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:48,496
Does he know?

340
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,499
He's gone.

341
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:55,419
Silly.

342
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:57,838
Are you going to fire me?

343
00:45:57,922 --> 00:45:59,173
Fire you?

344
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:01,926
Of course not!

345
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:07,056
We have to take you to get checked.

346
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,558
Look, Mom! I drew a plane.

347
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,102
Let's see.

348
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:15,106
Why is Cleo crying?

349
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,483
She has a tummy ache.

350
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:26,284
<i>Pain, pain, go away,</i>
<i>I don't want this pain to stay.</i>

351
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:29,870
Sofi! I told you to help Pepe write,
"I miss you a lot, Dad."

352
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:31,580
He wouldn't let me help!

353
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:14,832
Sorry.

354
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:12,932
- Hello.
- Hi, how can I help you?

355
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,683
We have an appointment with Doctor Vélez.

356
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:18,020
- Under what name?
- Cleodegaria Gutiérrez.

357
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:21,482
Here she comes.

358
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:25,194
- Sofía!
- Margarita! How are you?

359
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:27,905
Thank you for seeing us. Remember Cleo?

360
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:30,991
- Hi, Cleo. How are you?
- Fine, thank you, Doctor.

361
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:34,995
I'm going to check her
and we'll see you later.

362
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:36,997
Okay. I'll go say hi to Dr. Zavala.

363
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:39,708
It'll take about 40 minutes.

364
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:42,962
Cleo, come with me.

365
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:46,924
When was your last period?

366
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:49,635
About when?

367
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,557
- Three months.
- Three months.

368
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,060
Are you sexually active?

369
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:02,189
You are.

370
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,361
When did you start?

371
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:11,991
Has it been long?

372
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:16,996
Not long.

373
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:19,039
One or two years?

374
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:20,666
Less?

375
00:49:22,168 --> 00:49:23,294
Less.

376
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,255
But more than three months?

377
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:30,259
How many sexual partners have you had?

378
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,097
Just one?

379
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:37,516
Very well.

380
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,312
Don't worry. This is common.

381
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:46,400
We'll examine you from the waist down.

382
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:51,155
She'll get you in position.

383
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,407
Lie down, carefully.

384
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,583
Put one leg here.

385
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:05,711
And the other here.

386
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:15,221
I'll see you in a month. Any questions?

387
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:21,268
There she is. I'll go with you.

388
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:25,606
He hasn't even called the kids.

389
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,650
- Mario!
- Doctor.

390
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,112
How's Cleo?

391
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:33,822
Cleo is fine.

392
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:38,369
She's three to four months pregnant.

393
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:41,789
With some rest, she'll be fine.

394
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,040
When's she due?

395
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:46,710
Around the end of June.

396
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:51,382
- Thanks for seeing her.
- It's nothing!

397
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:53,175
- Take care.
- You too.

398
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:54,176
- Mario.
- Doctor.

399
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,303
- Take care.
- Thanks.

400
00:50:56,762 --> 00:51:00,891
Cleo, why don't you go to see the newborns
while I finish up with Dr. Zavala?

401
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:05,604
You have to talk to Antonio.

402
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:13,779
Look at your little sister, Azucena.

403
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:16,782
I'm glad she's a girl.

404
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:20,411
Yes. So you can play with her.

405
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:27,334
I'll do her hair, and bathe her...

406
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:33,841
Soon we'll take her home
so you can play with her.

407
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:36,760
Earthquake!

408
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,722
Kneel.

409
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:42,141
Get the babies out!

410
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:45,394
- Don't run!
- Use the stairs!

411
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,479
Our Father, Who art in Heaven...

412
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,984
Hurry, the babies!

413
00:52:57,758 --> 00:53:00,052
Are they gonna be
talking in English the whole time?

414
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:03,347
Yes. And Ricky isn't even a gringo,
he was born in Mexico.

415
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,182
Yeah, but his mom is a gringa.

416
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:08,477
Leslie scares me.
She makes me feel like I stink.

417
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,354
Because you do stink, fatty.

418
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,356
You smell even more, idiot.

419
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:14,858
Stinky.

420
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:17,820
Shut up, idiot.

421
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,869
Benita,
help them with the suitcases.

422
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:30,958
Hi! So nice to see you!

423
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:36,380
- <i>Comadre,</i> welcome!
- Hi, "commy."

424
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:38,841
That belly of yours?

425
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,176
I'll tell you later.

426
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:43,679
Yes, you will.

427
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:48,308
Sure, but give me a hand.

428
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:52,896
You sure you can carry it all?

429
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:56,442
I'm pregnant, not sick.
Why, are you tired?

430
00:53:56,525 --> 00:54:00,195
- As if!
- You've gotten so old since last year.

431
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:03,615
Mountains are old,
but they're still green.

432
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:05,200
Here!

433
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,619
You're pregnant and forgetful?

434
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:10,831
That's one bed.

435
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,833
This goes here.

436
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:15,919
And there's the other one.

437
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:18,547
This one's for Paco.

438
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,636
They were in storage.

439
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:27,806
They're all the dogs that lived here.

440
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:31,643
Look. That there was Pirata.

441
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,897
He died in 1911.

442
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,401
Do you remember Canela?

443
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:40,652
Yes, where is she?

444
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:44,114
Look at her. She died last summer.

445
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:46,950
They say she ate a poisoned rat.

446
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:51,789
But I'm sure it was the villagers
angry with Don José over the land.

447
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:55,709
Come on.

448
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:10,265
Hi.

449
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:03,151
What do you think
of these city folks, Celso?

450
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:06,822
- Should we send for more bullets?
- There's plenty, Doctor José.

451
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:11,535
- Paco! Don't go there! Cleo, get him.
- Hey Ricky, try this one.

452
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:15,038
Paco, I'm telling you. Stay there!

453
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:17,583
- What? Women don't shoot?
- Oh, no.

454
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:20,878
No, no, no, no. Not that.
Leslie is our representative.

455
00:56:20,961 --> 00:56:22,462
Doesn't count, she's a gringa.

456
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,047
Okay, I'll go.

457
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:25,090
Yes, go!

458
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:27,467
Leslie, can you please help Claudia?

459
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:28,385
Come!

460
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:31,305
Now darling, this is a loaded weapon.
You have to be very careful with it.

461
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,598
Point the gun down.

462
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:34,892
Point the gun down
when you're not using it.

463
00:56:36,018 --> 00:56:39,313
Come on, Lola! You're really going to wear
a mini skirt and platform shoes?

464
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:40,856
Honey, we're in the woods!

465
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:43,191
- You look great, Lola.
- That's fine.

466
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:45,903
Okay, honey, just put your feet
in the "T" position,

467
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:47,905
pull the trigger way back, and shoot.

468
00:56:49,615 --> 00:56:50,824
Okay, one more time.

469
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,410
- Oh!
- Yes!

470
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:56,413
Watch out, Pepe!
Your wife is going to join the guerrilla!

471
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,873
Come away. You might get hurt.

472
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:00,834
- She's gonna expropriate your hacienda!
- Nah, I'll whack her first.

473
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:03,670
Okay, come on. Do one more.

474
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,108
- Come with me.
- Where?

475
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,277
- Just come.
- What about him?

476
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,529
Is the boogeyman coming?

477
00:58:58,285 --> 00:58:59,619
Where are we going?

478
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:01,830
Don't ask.

479
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:06,251
The city's made you distrustful.

480
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:07,878
No, Benita.

481
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:10,213
Look at the dogs.

482
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:12,632
They're tired.

483
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:16,344
The kids won't leave them alone.

484
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:24,311
Be careful, don't roll down
with that belly of yours.

485
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,229
No, Benita.

486
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,412
There's a lot of music.

487
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:44,581
It's New Year's!

488
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,500
Should I call Lupe and Yola?

489
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,086
No, we don't want
those city nannies here.

490
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:51,922
They feel fancier than their bosses. Come.

491
00:59:57,636 --> 01:00:00,305
- They allowed you out?
- Move aside.

492
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:02,390
Sit here.

493
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:06,937
What are you drinking?

494
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,355
Nothing, thank you.

495
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:11,858
You're not going to toast
the New Year with us?

496
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:13,819
It's not good for the baby.

497
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,862
A little won't hurt.

498
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,531
Celebrate while you can!

499
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:21,159
See that man over there?

500
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:25,622
They killed his son in August
over the land dispute.

501
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:28,959
- You're carrying life, right?
- Yes.

502
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:31,419
So then? Mezcal?

503
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:33,672
No, just a little pulque.

504
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,132
That's the spirit!

505
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,138
Here.

506
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:48,562
To a beautiful 1971
and your baby's health!

507
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:54,192
- Sorry, manita...
- Go dance, Gloria!

508
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:56,319
Don't worry. Don't worry.

509
01:00:58,155 --> 01:00:59,990
I'll pour you some more.

510
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:03,702
Here it is. Clean yourself up.

511
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,370
<i>Salud! Salud!</i>

512
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:06,663
Cheer up!

513
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:09,499
[dance music plays in the distance,
people chatting]

514
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:35,817
What's wrong with you?

515
01:01:35,901 --> 01:01:37,819
I know you need it.

516
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:39,571
Billy, no!

517
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:42,324
I just wanted to comfort you.

518
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,533
You're drunk.

519
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,287
You're not even that hot, <i>comadre.</i>

520
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:03,655
Fire! Fire!

521
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:06,324
Fire! Fire! Fire!

522
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:08,702
Fire! The woods are burning!

523
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:14,499
Everybody come! Quick!
Fire in the woods!

524
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:19,754
Come on! Move! This way, everyone!

525
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:33,059
Careful! Cover that side!

526
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:38,982
- Come here. Now!
- We need water!

527
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:45,322
Make a chain!

528
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:50,952
We need water! Pass the buckets!

529
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:54,122
Kids! Stay back!

530
01:03:55,707 --> 01:03:59,377
Kids! Don't step on the flames!

531
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:05,925
- Cleo, help the little ones get water.
- Yes, ma'am.

532
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:10,847
Just the little fires.

533
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:18,521
That's it, Andy!
Gerardo, Cleo will help you.

534
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:23,318
Eleven, ten...

535
01:04:23,902 --> 01:04:25,904
- Not too close to the fire!
- Nine...

536
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:28,740
Eight, seven...

537
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:32,577
six, five...

538
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:36,164
four, three,

539
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:38,416
two, one.

540
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,168
Happy New Year!

541
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:26,441
- Ricky!
- Toño!

542
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:30,028
It ran away! Ah!

543
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:32,155
Catch it! Catch it!

544
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:35,992
Got it!

545
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:37,202
Pass it!

546
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:41,956
Go, go, go, go, go, Toño!

547
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,166
Hey, Toño!

548
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:54,511
We'll reach the hill skirt
and come back!

549
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:55,470
Skirt?

550
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:57,514
The hillside.

551
01:06:57,597 --> 01:06:59,516
The hill has a skirt?

552
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:02,810
The slope then!

553
01:07:02,894 --> 01:07:05,104
Alex! The hill has a skirt!

554
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:08,316
If we peek under, we can see its panties.

555
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:11,319
- What are you doing?
- Looking at the hill's panties.

556
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:14,072
Hills don't have panties.

557
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:16,574
- Neither do you!
- Asshole!

558
01:07:16,658 --> 01:07:19,786
I'm going to tell your parents!

559
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:38,513
This feels like my village.

560
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:42,684
It's drier there. But it feels like it...

561
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:48,314
The animals do that too.

562
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:55,071
It sounds like this.

563
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:02,078
And smells the same.

564
01:08:29,564 --> 01:08:32,358
- Come, Beto!
- They repaired the Galaxy.

565
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:33,651
It looks like new!

566
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:42,702
The Cowboys won
because Baltimore got cocky.

567
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:45,413
We won anyway!

568
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:48,166
Baltimore got cocky.
Who likes the Cowboys?

569
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:51,794
And Cruz Azul champions forever!

570
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:53,671
- Hello, Beto.
- Afternoon,<i> Señora.</i>

571
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:55,840
- Can we go to the movies?
- To see what?

572
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:58,176
- <i>Marooned.</i>
- I wanna see it too.

573
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:01,679
- Only Beto and me.
- Why?

574
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:03,848
- I wanna go too!
- No!

575
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:06,017
- Everyone can go!
- Not fair!

576
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,394
- I'm going.
- You're not.

577
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:11,105
- Everyone goes!
- That's not fair!

578
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:13,191
If you don't like it, go live elsewhere!

579
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,444
Mrs. Molly is on the phone.

580
01:09:17,028 --> 01:09:18,696
- I'll get it upstairs.
- I'll take them.

581
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,657
No! You won't like it.

582
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:24,243
- I like movies.
- Not this one.

583
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:25,453
Eat poo!

584
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:27,830
Is it a cartoon?

585
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:32,001
No, it's not.

586
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:35,630
- You don't know what <i>Marooned</i> is.
- Yes I do!

587
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:39,300
Borras, Borras.

588
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:42,303
Borras.

589
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:54,273
We're late!

590
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,526
Are you coming?

591
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:59,237
- Grandma, we need to go.
- Toño, let's go.

592
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:01,531
We're leaving!

593
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:04,909
- Wait! I'm coming.
- Let's go.

594
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:18,464
Borras, Borras!

595
01:10:21,676 --> 01:10:25,680
- Catch him!
- Hurry up!

596
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:28,015
Come on, we're late!

597
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:36,983
What are you waiting for?

598
01:10:37,817 --> 01:10:38,860
Toño!

599
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:40,987
Toño, Beto!

600
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:43,114
Don't run!

601
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:45,742
Kids!

602
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:47,785
Toño!

603
01:11:01,632 --> 01:11:02,967
- Toño!
- Run!

604
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:05,303
- Cleo, get them!
- I'll see you at the movies!

605
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:08,014
- Control your children!
- Toño!

606
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:11,476
Toño!

607
01:11:15,062 --> 01:11:16,063
Toño!

608
01:12:31,389 --> 01:12:34,392
- Check her out!
- Look at her!

609
01:12:36,394 --> 01:12:37,353
Antonio.

610
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:40,439
Hey, watch out!

611
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:43,442
- Look, your dad!
- Run, Antonio, run!

612
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:46,863
- No, it wasn't my dad.
- Yes, it was your dad.

613
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:48,030
I said no!

614
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:53,661
Put the magazine away!

615
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:56,330
Let's go.

616
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:01,878
Your grandma is worried.

617
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:08,634
Come on, let's get the tickets.

618
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:29,006
...following
our illustrious governor's instructions...

619
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:37,223
...to improve the infrastructure,
I've come here today

620
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:40,017
to respond to your demand for water.

621
01:14:41,268 --> 01:14:44,605
This can only happen

622
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:48,943
by uniting the will of the people

623
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:51,696
with the leadership

624
01:14:51,779 --> 01:14:56,575
of our illustrious
President Luis Echeverría Álvarez.

625
01:14:57,618 --> 01:15:00,496
Excuse me, do you know
where this address is?

626
01:15:01,372 --> 01:15:03,207
- That way.
- Thank you.

627
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:07,169
We will move... above and beyond!

628
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:12,359
Ramón!

629
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:18,699
Ramón!

630
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:24,121
Ramón!

631
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:28,959
Hold up. Wait.

632
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:31,879
- What's up, Cleo?
- Hi.

633
01:16:32,213 --> 01:16:34,965
I just came to give Fermín his jacket.

634
01:16:35,049 --> 01:16:36,258
I'll give it to him.

635
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,385
But I need to talk to him.

636
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:40,012
He's not here.

637
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:42,014
It's important.

638
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:44,058
But we're rehearsing.

639
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:47,770
Adela said you would help.

640
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:50,898
One sec.

641
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:54,693
Hold on to this.

642
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:58,280
Can you give me a ride?

643
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:00,366
Let's go.

644
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:02,159
Hold on, let me put on some pants.

645
01:17:21,512 --> 01:17:23,139
Here is where he trains.

646
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:25,975
Thank you, Ramón.

647
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:30,563
Don't tell him I brought you.

648
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:32,523
No. Thank you.

649
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:06,200
Right flank!

650
01:19:23,926 --> 01:19:25,219
It's Zovek.

651
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:26,595
No! Really?

652
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:28,430
Yes! Look at him.

653
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:30,474
The Professor Zovek?

654
01:19:30,557 --> 01:19:31,558
Yes!

655
01:19:32,059 --> 01:19:33,560
Does he always come here?

656
01:19:33,644 --> 01:19:36,313
No. But sometimes he trains them.

657
01:19:52,579 --> 01:19:53,622
Welcome!

658
01:19:55,374 --> 01:19:59,295
May the energy dwell in you.

659
01:20:02,423 --> 01:20:03,340
You.

660
01:20:04,008 --> 01:20:05,009
You.

661
01:20:05,092 --> 01:20:06,176
And you as well!

662
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:08,637
You can become a warrior!

663
01:20:09,346 --> 01:20:11,724
Every human has a great potential...

664
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:15,394
that can be developed
through physical training.

665
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:16,645
Yes!

666
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:22,443
But most importantly,
through the evolution of the mind...

667
01:20:23,444 --> 01:20:24,695
and the spirit.

668
01:20:25,863 --> 01:20:28,198
You can develop this potential.

669
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:30,242
But don't expect a miracle!

670
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:36,373
The only miracle resides
within your own will.

671
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:39,918
Remember, the mind...

672
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:42,296
is the motor...

673
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:45,341
for the physical.

674
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:50,554
And up next...

675
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:56,226
an act.

676
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:05,027
This act requires
total physical and mental focus.

677
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:12,284
Only the Lamas, martial arts masters,

678
01:21:12,743 --> 01:21:14,620
and a few great athletes...

679
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:18,290
have been able to master it.

680
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:22,920
You.

681
01:21:23,629 --> 01:21:24,963
Yes, you. Come here.

682
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:30,552
Please cover my eyes.

683
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:38,519
Make sure they are properly covered.

684
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:43,399
Thank you. You may return to your place.

685
01:22:24,064 --> 01:22:26,066
What? Disappointed?

686
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:31,822
What did you expect?
For me to levitate or lift a jet?

687
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:34,950
You are witnessing an incredible feat!

688
01:22:35,576 --> 01:22:36,827
If you don't believe me,

689
01:22:37,703 --> 01:22:38,996
then try it.

690
01:22:39,913 --> 01:22:42,124
But with your eyes closed.

691
01:23:43,185 --> 01:23:44,186
Hey, Lobo!

692
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:46,396
- How are you, Fermín?
- Good.

693
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,982
- How did you feel about the training?
- It's tough.

694
01:23:49,483 --> 01:23:50,943
What about the new trainers?

695
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:53,111
The Korean coach is good.

696
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:55,405
Yes, but tough.

697
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:04,248
Fermín.

698
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,001
Do you have a minute?

699
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:12,673
Piss off!

700
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:17,261
Hi, Cleo.

701
01:24:17,636 --> 01:24:18,637
Hi, Fermín.

702
01:24:19,429 --> 01:24:20,722
What brings you around?

703
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:25,686
I've left you messages,
but I couldn't find you.

704
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:29,690
I'm sorry, training has been intense.

705
01:24:30,649 --> 01:24:32,943
They even brought a gringo coach
and a Korean.

706
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:36,321
Well, the American was already here,
but the Korean is new.

707
01:24:37,197 --> 01:24:38,991
Is it for the Olympics?

708
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:40,701
Something like that.

709
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:42,869
Who told you I was here?

710
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:51,545
A neighbor's brother-in-law
trains here with you.

711
01:24:52,045 --> 01:24:53,005
It was Ramón.

712
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:54,006
No.

713
01:24:55,007 --> 01:25:01,847
I'm gonna kick that fat fucker's ass.

714
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:05,183
It's just that I'm pregnant.

715
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:07,352
What's it to me?

716
01:25:08,061 --> 01:25:11,023
- It's just that, the little one's yours.
- No fucking way.

717
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:12,482
I swear it is.

718
01:25:13,483 --> 01:25:15,569
I told you, no fucking way.

719
01:25:15,652 --> 01:25:18,530
And if you don't want me to beat the shit
out of you and your "little one,"

720
01:25:18,614 --> 01:25:21,283
don't ever say it again,
and don't ever come looking for me again.

721
01:25:27,581 --> 01:25:28,749
Fucking servant!

722
01:25:33,587 --> 01:25:35,380
Hurry up, Fermín!

723
01:25:58,779 --> 01:26:03,033
He went with his mistress
to Acapulco.

724
01:26:04,284 --> 01:26:08,246
He hasn't sent a dime,
and it's been six months.

725
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:11,333
He says he's short on money
and doesn't have any to send.

726
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:14,920
But now he likes diving
and is buying all the gear.

727
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:17,589
You know how much that costs?

728
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:25,681
He sends letters to the kids
pretending he's in Quebec.

729
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:32,145
Such bullshit he invents.

730
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:36,108
- Paco! Come here!
- That the landscape is beautiful...

731
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:37,025
Paco!

732
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:41,613
That he misses them
but his research is delayed.

733
01:26:41,697 --> 01:26:44,324
- Lies!
- Paco!

734
01:26:46,785 --> 01:26:51,456
- Paco, come here.
- Okay, don't worry, I'll call you later.

735
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:54,126
Are you spying on me?

736
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:59,131
I'm sorry, my love. I'm sorry!

737
01:27:01,842 --> 01:27:03,885
And you!
Why did you let him? Why?

738
01:27:07,806 --> 01:27:10,517
Why are you still there?
Don't you have anything to do?

739
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:12,269
Get out!

740
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:17,649
Please don't tell your siblings.

741
01:27:24,614 --> 01:27:28,326
You're winning by two laps!

742
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:32,414
Ah! He's passing you, Paco!

743
01:27:33,415 --> 01:27:35,709
But I'm still winning.

744
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:39,379
I want to play!

745
01:27:39,671 --> 01:27:41,465
No. Move!

746
01:27:43,049 --> 01:27:44,968
- Move, Pepe.
- No.

747
01:27:45,051 --> 01:27:46,052
Move!

748
01:27:46,636 --> 01:27:47,804
No.

749
01:27:47,888 --> 01:27:50,223
- I said move!
- No!

750
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:53,894
- That's mine, Paco!
- No, it's mine.

751
01:28:34,518 --> 01:28:35,435
Cleo!

752
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:38,438
- They're fighting.
- I'm coming.

753
01:28:41,775 --> 01:28:43,485
Let go, please!

754
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:48,365
Paco, Toño, stop!
You're going to get hurt!

755
01:28:48,657 --> 01:28:50,033
You're not animals!

756
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:51,284
Toño!

757
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:55,580
Toño! Let him go!

758
01:28:57,749 --> 01:29:00,001
Paco, drop that!

759
01:29:00,085 --> 01:29:02,170
What are you doing? Drop that!

760
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:06,091
Don't be an idiot!

761
01:29:06,424 --> 01:29:11,638
Are you stupid? You could've killed him!

762
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:14,891
It's very dangerous.

763
01:29:22,232 --> 01:29:23,275
[ Hey, manita. ]

764
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:27,654
[ I heard the government
came to the village... ]

765
01:29:28,071 --> 01:29:30,907
[ to seize land,
and they've taken your mom's. ]

766
01:29:31,825 --> 01:29:33,827
[ How can I help her? ]

767
01:29:34,244 --> 01:29:36,413
[ You could go see her. ]

768
01:29:38,832 --> 01:29:40,417
[ Like this? ]

769
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:41,835
[ Don't worry. ]

770
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:49,843
[ Go rest. I'll open the gate. ]

771
01:31:15,095 --> 01:31:17,013
We are alone.

772
01:31:17,514 --> 01:31:23,395
No matter what they tell you,
we women are always alone.

773
01:32:10,316 --> 01:32:13,778
We'll have to park here.
The students are protesting.

774
01:32:13,862 --> 01:32:17,407
Oh, God.
I hope they don't beat them again.

775
01:32:17,490 --> 01:32:18,700
Look. Someone's leaving.

776
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:37,510
Go ahead.

777
01:33:43,034 --> 01:33:44,911
Good afternoon, <i>Señora.</i>

778
01:33:44,994 --> 01:33:48,581
My maid needs a crib.
Can you show them to us?

779
01:33:49,415 --> 01:33:54,671
- She'll show them to you.
- Thank you.

780
01:33:54,754 --> 01:33:56,172
This way, please.

781
01:34:06,266 --> 01:34:07,475
How about this one?

782
01:34:08,184 --> 01:34:10,228
Do you like it, Cleo?

783
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:11,896
It's very pretty.

784
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,982
How much is it?

785
01:34:15,608 --> 01:34:18,153
No, but with a long-standing
client discount.

786
01:34:18,236 --> 01:34:20,530
Let me ask the manager.

787
01:34:21,531 --> 01:34:24,617
We bought the furniture
for the boys' room here.

788
01:34:24,701 --> 01:34:27,495
Which is now in Sofi and Pepe's room.

789
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:29,581
- The blue set?
- Yes.

790
01:34:34,085 --> 01:34:36,379
[gunshots fire,
shoppers chatter nervously]

791
01:35:04,032 --> 01:35:06,242
Please help me! They're killing us!

792
01:35:13,124 --> 01:35:15,752
Where is he?

793
01:35:17,503 --> 01:35:20,131
Get in! Leave him alone!

794
01:35:20,215 --> 01:35:21,716
Move!

795
01:35:21,799 --> 01:35:23,593
- Shut up!
- Come here!

796
01:35:26,304 --> 01:35:28,681
I said shut up!

797
01:35:29,766 --> 01:35:32,185
Fermín! Let's go!

798
01:35:37,774 --> 01:35:39,442
Fermín, let's go! Now!

799
01:35:40,985 --> 01:35:41,861
Fermín!

800
01:35:42,195 --> 01:35:45,740
Help me! Help!

801
01:35:49,619 --> 01:35:52,372
Help! Help!

802
01:35:54,874 --> 01:35:58,378
Be calm, Cleo.

803
01:35:59,045 --> 01:36:00,255
Ignacio!

804
01:36:23,444 --> 01:36:24,696
Help me!

805
01:36:25,071 --> 01:36:26,948
Help me! Help me!

806
01:36:28,825 --> 01:36:31,202
Jorge, please, let's go!

807
01:36:34,372 --> 01:36:35,456
Why?

808
01:36:37,667 --> 01:36:38,835
Help!

809
01:36:39,335 --> 01:36:40,670
Help me!

810
01:36:41,129 --> 01:36:43,339
Help me! Help me!

811
01:37:08,614 --> 01:37:14,078
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace.</i>
<i>The Lord is with thee...</i>

812
01:38:21,104 --> 01:38:23,314
Dr. Vélez!

813
01:38:24,816 --> 01:38:26,484
- With Dr. Vélez.
- Get in line!

814
01:38:26,567 --> 01:38:28,986
- You have an appointment?
- Her water broke.

815
01:38:29,070 --> 01:38:34,117
- Find Dr. Vélez.
- Here she comes.

816
01:38:34,992 --> 01:38:36,619
Doctor, your patient is here.

817
01:38:37,161 --> 01:38:40,706
Orderly, please. Sofía just called me.

818
01:38:41,457 --> 01:38:45,169
Hello ma'am.
Cleo, you're having contractions.

819
01:38:45,253 --> 01:38:49,549
Let's get her to delivery.
You'll have to fill out some forms.

820
01:38:50,091 --> 01:38:52,635
Paty, take their information.
We're going to delivery.

821
01:38:52,718 --> 01:38:56,347
Yes, Doctor. Please come this way.

822
01:38:56,931 --> 01:39:00,977
- What's her full name?
- Cleodegaria Gutiérrez.

823
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:02,645
Her middle name?

824
01:39:03,104 --> 01:39:04,272
I don't know.

825
01:39:04,355 --> 01:39:07,024
- How old is she?
- I don't know.

826
01:39:07,525 --> 01:39:09,444
Her date of birth?

827
01:39:10,403 --> 01:39:13,030
What's your relationship with the patient?

828
01:39:13,114 --> 01:39:14,115
I'm her employer.

829
01:39:14,198 --> 01:39:17,785
- Is there any family member here?
- No. No.

830
01:39:17,869 --> 01:39:19,704
That's fine.

831
01:39:20,037 --> 01:39:23,249
One last question.
Is your patient insured?

832
01:39:31,174 --> 01:39:32,091
Good evening.

833
01:39:34,886 --> 01:39:37,305
Careful. Let's go.

834
01:39:41,267 --> 01:39:42,393
One moment, please.

835
01:39:43,561 --> 01:39:44,520
Excuse me.

836
01:39:44,896 --> 01:39:46,189
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

837
01:39:46,898 --> 01:39:48,608
Hello, Cleo. How are you feeling?

838
01:39:49,192 --> 01:39:51,235
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

839
01:39:51,319 --> 01:39:54,113
Isn't it, Dr. Vélez?
How many babies have you delivered?

840
01:39:54,238 --> 01:39:55,656
Hundreds, Doctor.

841
01:39:57,366 --> 01:39:59,243
Give me your hand. Give me your hand.

842
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:00,870
And breathe.

843
01:40:02,955 --> 01:40:04,665
- We must hurry.
- Yes, Doctor.

844
01:40:04,749 --> 01:40:05,791
Breathe.

845
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:06,834
Breathe.

846
01:40:11,172 --> 01:40:12,840
Excuse me. Over here.

847
01:40:14,342 --> 01:40:16,344
This way.

848
01:40:16,427 --> 01:40:19,805
Dr. Vélez won't let me go in.
You'll do great, Cleo.

849
01:40:19,889 --> 01:40:22,016
Feel free to come if you like.

850
01:40:22,475 --> 01:40:24,101
I can't. I have an appointment.

851
01:40:24,185 --> 01:40:25,978
Come on, let's go.

852
01:40:28,022 --> 01:40:33,069
I'm taking a patient to delivery.
Ask admissions for her file.

853
01:40:36,113 --> 01:40:38,324
Please assist me.

854
01:40:38,407 --> 01:40:42,537
Pass me the partogram. Let's examine her.

855
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:43,496
Yes, Doctor.

856
01:40:43,579 --> 01:40:47,750
She is in labor. Her water broke.

857
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:50,836
Cleo, when was your last period?

858
01:40:52,171 --> 01:40:54,048
- September.
- September.

859
01:40:54,507 --> 01:40:57,760
I'm removing your underwear and shoes.

860
01:40:57,843 --> 01:40:59,595
We're moving you into position.

861
01:40:59,887 --> 01:41:04,809
- I'm going to listen to your baby.
- When did your water break?

862
01:41:06,185 --> 01:41:10,231
- Around two hours ago?
- We couldn't get here quicker.

863
01:41:10,314 --> 01:41:13,985
- Don't worry. Breathe.
- I'm uncovering your belly.

864
01:41:14,569 --> 01:41:17,989
- Easy, Cleo. Breathe deep.
- Breathe.

865
01:41:18,072 --> 01:41:20,866
How is the heart rate?

866
01:41:20,950 --> 01:41:23,035
- I can't hear anything, Doctor.
- Okay.

867
01:41:23,494 --> 01:41:26,247
- A glove, please.
- Glove, Doctor.

868
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:30,418
I need you to breathe deeply.

869
01:41:30,501 --> 01:41:33,337
I'm going to inspect you.
It'll bother a bit.

870
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:37,508
- Relax. Easy, please.
- Breathe.

871
01:41:37,592 --> 01:41:41,304
- How is it?
- Complete. Direct. Third plane.

872
01:41:41,721 --> 01:41:46,058
- Meconium liquid, Doctor.
- We need to canalize.

873
01:41:46,142 --> 01:41:49,729
- Moving patient to surgery.
- Let me listen to your baby.

874
01:41:49,812 --> 01:41:52,106
Easy.

875
01:41:52,898 --> 01:41:55,443
- I'm not hearing anything, Doctor.
- Let's move.

876
01:41:55,776 --> 01:41:57,111
Get the stretcher.

877
01:41:58,738 --> 01:42:02,283
Cleo, breathe deeply.
We're taking you to surgery. Okay. One...

878
01:42:02,366 --> 01:42:04,660
One, two, three.

879
01:42:04,744 --> 01:42:07,204
- Let's go!
- Easy.

880
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:09,707
Patient coming through, please.

881
01:42:11,417 --> 01:42:12,793
Call Pediatrics!

882
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:48,704
- Call Pediatrics.
- No scrubs. It's an emergency.

883
01:42:49,914 --> 01:42:50,956
Turning on lamp.

884
01:42:55,378 --> 01:42:59,131
Everyone ready? One, two, three.

885
01:43:00,257 --> 01:43:02,301
Pediatrics to surgery!

886
01:43:05,137 --> 01:43:07,014
Move your waist further down, please.

887
01:43:10,893 --> 01:43:12,478
Doctor, she's crowning.

888
01:43:12,561 --> 01:43:14,730
- No time for your scrubs.
- Okay.

889
01:43:15,231 --> 01:43:19,527
- Pediatrician to the room!
- He's in the room, Doctor.

890
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:24,115
- Doctor, she's crowning.
- I'm checking.

891
01:43:24,198 --> 01:43:28,619
Where is the pediatrician?

892
01:43:28,703 --> 01:43:30,454
I'm here, Doctor.

893
01:43:30,538 --> 01:43:31,664
Breathe.

894
01:43:31,747 --> 01:43:34,166
Patient ready to deliver.

895
01:43:34,250 --> 01:43:36,043
The head is out.

896
01:43:36,127 --> 01:43:37,503
Easy. Good.

897
01:43:37,586 --> 01:43:38,671
Edwin, please.

898
01:43:40,131 --> 01:43:41,173
Cut the cord.

899
01:43:41,757 --> 01:43:42,675
Tongs.

900
01:43:43,884 --> 01:43:45,010
Cut the cord, please.

901
01:43:46,095 --> 01:43:47,054
Cutting.

902
01:43:49,682 --> 01:43:52,727
We couldn't hear a heart rate, Doctor.

903
01:43:52,810 --> 01:43:55,396
Your stethoscope.

904
01:43:55,479 --> 01:43:57,773
We're going to give you a few stitches.

905
01:43:57,857 --> 01:43:59,525
I can't hear a heartbeat.

906
01:44:00,568 --> 01:44:02,027
Listening.

907
01:44:02,611 --> 01:44:03,487
Easy.

908
01:44:03,571 --> 01:44:05,948
It's in arrest.
Begin resuscitation.

909
01:44:06,699 --> 01:44:08,534
Your placenta is coming out.

910
01:44:08,617 --> 01:44:09,952
- One, two, three.
- Ventilating.

911
01:44:10,035 --> 01:44:11,412
- One, two, three.
- Ventilating.

912
01:44:11,495 --> 01:44:13,247
- One, two, three.
- Ventilating.

913
01:44:13,330 --> 01:44:14,290
Listening.

914
01:44:14,665 --> 01:44:16,542
Your placenta is coming out.

915
01:44:17,460 --> 01:44:19,795
Ma'am, I can't hear a heartbeat.

916
01:44:21,672 --> 01:44:23,632
Placenta coming out.

917
01:44:23,716 --> 01:44:25,092
- One, two, three.
- Ventilating.

918
01:44:25,176 --> 01:44:26,469
- One, two, three.
- Ventilating.

919
01:44:26,552 --> 01:44:27,928
- One, two, three.
- Ventilating.

920
01:44:28,012 --> 01:44:29,013
Listening.

921
01:44:30,264 --> 01:44:31,557
There's no response.

922
01:44:32,975 --> 01:44:34,143
Another cycle, Doctor?

923
01:44:34,226 --> 01:44:35,311
Let's continue.

924
01:44:35,394 --> 01:44:36,812
- One, two, three.
- Ventilating.

925
01:44:36,896 --> 01:44:38,189
- One, two, three.
- Ventilating.

926
01:44:38,272 --> 01:44:40,608
- One, two, three.
- Ventilating.

927
01:44:40,691 --> 01:44:42,359
- Here it is, Doctor.
- Listening.

928
01:44:45,029 --> 01:44:46,113
No response.

929
01:44:47,448 --> 01:44:48,991
We're suspending CPR.

930
01:44:57,458 --> 01:45:00,419
Doctor, what's the patient's name?

931
01:45:00,503 --> 01:45:01,962
Cleo, Doctor.

932
01:45:02,797 --> 01:45:03,714
Cutting...

933
01:45:06,383 --> 01:45:10,846
Cleo, I'm very sorry.
Your baby was born dead.

934
01:45:12,556 --> 01:45:15,851
We did all we could,
but there was no response.

935
01:45:16,727 --> 01:45:18,103
Would you like to hold it?

936
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:19,980
Yes.

937
01:45:24,276 --> 01:45:26,779
Here is your baby. It's a girl.

938
01:45:35,204 --> 01:45:36,997
Say goodbye to her.

939
01:45:40,876 --> 01:45:44,088
I need to take her now, Cleo.
Say goodbye to her.

940
01:45:51,262 --> 01:45:53,639
Let me have her, please.
I need to prepare her.

941
01:46:02,189 --> 01:46:03,190
Allow me...

942
01:46:06,193 --> 01:46:08,320
- Prepare her, please.
- Yes, Doctor.

943
01:46:08,821 --> 01:46:10,114
Gutiérrez, Cleodegaria.

944
01:46:10,197 --> 01:46:12,950
- Here's the file, Doctor.
- Thank you.

945
01:46:21,876 --> 01:46:23,961
There's a bit of bleeding.

946
01:46:24,587 --> 01:46:28,382
We gave you a few stitches.

947
01:46:29,592 --> 01:46:31,010
We're very sorry, Cleo.

948
01:48:21,161 --> 01:48:24,415
Cleo! The knife sharpener.
[ Shake yourself off. ]

949
01:49:17,551 --> 01:49:18,635
Borras.

950
01:49:20,596 --> 01:49:22,347
Borras. Come, Borras.

951
01:49:23,265 --> 01:49:24,224
Borras.

952
01:49:25,434 --> 01:49:26,643
Come, Borras.

953
01:50:02,054 --> 01:50:05,808
- Toño! Sofi! Come!
- Mom bought a new car!

954
01:50:06,308 --> 01:50:07,351
You like it?

955
01:50:07,851 --> 01:50:09,019
How fast does it go?

956
01:50:09,978 --> 01:50:11,480
Why not a Maverick?

957
01:50:11,563 --> 01:50:14,399
Too expensive. I wanted a smaller car.

958
01:50:14,858 --> 01:50:17,069
I've had it with that Galaxy.

959
01:50:17,611 --> 01:50:19,488
I like it, Mommy.

960
01:50:21,198 --> 01:50:23,075
- What about the Galaxy?
- I sold it.

961
01:50:23,158 --> 01:50:25,369
- It goes next week.
- Does Dad know?

962
01:50:25,452 --> 01:50:27,037
No, it's a surprise.

963
01:50:27,996 --> 01:50:30,916
- Do you like the new car, Cleo?
- Yes.

964
01:50:31,708 --> 01:50:33,293
And speaking of surprises,

965
01:50:33,377 --> 01:50:36,672
we're taking the Galaxy
for a goodbye trip.

966
01:50:36,755 --> 01:50:38,257
- Where to?
- Tuxpan.

967
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:39,383
Where's that?

968
01:50:39,466 --> 01:50:41,301
- I've got a match.
- Skip it.

969
01:50:41,385 --> 01:50:42,761
Tuxpan is near Veracruz.

970
01:50:42,845 --> 01:50:44,221
- Is there a beach?
- Yes.

971
01:50:44,304 --> 01:50:46,181
The beaches in Veracruz are ugly.

972
01:50:46,640 --> 01:50:49,017
And we're going
to invite Cleo along, right?

973
01:50:49,101 --> 01:50:50,519
Yes!

974
01:50:50,602 --> 01:50:51,937
Will you come?

975
01:50:52,563 --> 01:50:54,189
Come on. It'll do you good.

976
01:50:54,273 --> 01:50:55,983
- Right, Adela?
- Yes, ma'am.

977
01:50:56,066 --> 01:50:58,193
Besides, the kids will miss you
if you don't come.

978
01:50:58,277 --> 01:50:59,111
Yes!

979
01:50:59,194 --> 01:51:01,530
But she'll be on vacation,
you can't make her work.

980
01:51:01,613 --> 01:51:02,614
Yes.

981
01:51:02,698 --> 01:51:03,866
Are you coming?

982
01:51:03,949 --> 01:51:06,160
[ Go, manita.
I'll take care of the house. ]

983
01:51:07,494 --> 01:51:08,704
So, you're coming?

984
01:51:09,663 --> 01:51:10,914
Yes!

985
01:51:10,998 --> 01:51:13,000
Perfect! Would you help me pack?

986
01:51:13,083 --> 01:51:14,626
- Yes, ma'am.
- Let's go pack.

987
01:51:15,586 --> 01:51:17,963
[ Go. It'll lift your spirits. ]

988
01:51:18,046 --> 01:51:20,632
- I'm gonna help her pack.
- Pepe, bring the guns.

989
01:51:53,165 --> 01:51:54,750
Stop changing it.

990
01:51:58,086 --> 01:51:59,796
La Pantera doesn't reach this far.

991
01:52:00,589 --> 01:52:02,424
I just heard it.

992
01:52:02,507 --> 01:52:04,426
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

993
01:52:04,509 --> 01:52:06,678
No, it's not!
It's only in the city.

994
01:52:08,805 --> 01:52:10,140
Look! The sea!

995
01:52:10,224 --> 01:52:11,767
Mom, stop, stop!

996
01:52:11,850 --> 01:52:16,605
- Let's go to the hotel first.
- No. It'll be dark by then.

997
01:52:16,688 --> 01:52:19,524
Beach! Beach!

998
01:52:19,608 --> 01:52:22,361
Beach! Beach!

999
01:52:22,444 --> 01:52:24,821
Beach! Beach!

1000
01:52:24,905 --> 01:52:27,282
All right.
But just for a little bit!

1001
01:52:27,366 --> 01:52:28,659
Yeah!

1002
01:52:39,378 --> 01:52:41,505
[Mrs. Sofía and children
exclaim excitedly]

1003
01:52:43,215 --> 01:52:44,424
Let's go!

1004
01:52:45,759 --> 01:52:46,718
Come on!

1005
01:53:05,112 --> 01:53:06,154
Come.

1006
01:53:06,238 --> 01:53:07,823
No, I don't know how to swim.

1007
01:53:07,906 --> 01:53:09,116
Come on.

1008
01:53:09,616 --> 01:53:11,535
You go. I'll watch you from here.

1009
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:34,308
- Which way?
- Follow me.

1010
01:53:36,435 --> 01:53:39,563
- Can we go back again?
- Yes, of course.

1011
01:53:39,646 --> 01:53:42,190
- But now a hot bath.
- Yes.

1012
01:53:44,401 --> 01:53:47,362
I want to go back.

1013
01:53:47,446 --> 01:53:52,826
- It was amazing!
- I jumped over a huge wave!

1014
01:53:52,909 --> 01:53:55,912
- When are we going to go back?
- Tomorrow!

1015
01:54:04,129 --> 01:54:07,174
Ow! Mom. Ow! Don't!

1016
01:54:14,097 --> 01:54:17,642
Ow! It burns!

1017
01:54:20,270 --> 01:54:22,522
Did you like the waves?

1018
01:54:24,024 --> 01:54:26,026
I did.

1019
01:54:27,444 --> 01:54:30,989
Do you know how to dive under them?

1020
01:54:33,367 --> 01:54:35,452
Have you gone mute?

1021
01:54:36,370 --> 01:54:37,621
No. Let's go.

1022
01:54:38,914 --> 01:54:41,041
I told you
to put on a t-shirt!

1023
01:54:41,124 --> 01:54:44,419
- But it was cloudy!
- The glare burns the most.

1024
01:54:48,131 --> 01:54:49,841
Dressed already?

1025
01:54:50,050 --> 01:54:52,886
Yes, but Cleo's gone mute.

1026
01:54:53,220 --> 01:54:55,347
- Thank you, Cleo.
- You're welcome, ma'am.

1027
01:54:56,098 --> 01:54:58,642
You two smell like salad.

1028
01:54:58,767 --> 01:55:00,769
[Paco and Sofi
continue groaning in pain]

1029
01:55:22,707 --> 01:55:23,834
Children!

1030
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:25,836
Children!

1031
01:55:26,670 --> 01:55:28,755
Kids! Listen!

1032
01:55:29,464 --> 01:55:30,924
I have something to tell you.

1033
01:55:34,261 --> 01:55:35,679
Your dad isn't in Ottawa.

1034
01:55:36,596 --> 01:55:37,889
Is he back?

1035
01:55:37,973 --> 01:55:38,849
No.

1036
01:55:39,433 --> 01:55:40,892
Your dad never went away.

1037
01:55:42,394 --> 01:55:44,104
Well, he did, but only for a week.

1038
01:55:46,773 --> 01:55:48,442
Your dad isn't coming back home.

1039
01:55:52,612 --> 01:55:54,865
We came here so he can take his things.

1040
01:55:55,365 --> 01:55:56,450
What things?

1041
01:55:56,908 --> 01:56:00,162
What he says are his things.

1042
01:56:01,455 --> 01:56:04,624
His clothes, his books,
his bookcases...

1043
01:56:05,959 --> 01:56:07,502
Are you getting a divorce?

1044
01:56:10,172 --> 01:56:11,339
He doesn't know.

1045
01:56:11,882 --> 01:56:13,758
He doesn't love us anymore?

1046
01:56:14,092 --> 01:56:16,970
Of course he loves you, a lot.

1047
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:20,932
- He says he wants to see you.
- When?

1048
01:56:21,766 --> 01:56:23,101
He doesn't know.

1049
01:56:24,811 --> 01:56:25,770
But soon.

1050
01:56:28,607 --> 01:56:32,444
There's going to be changes.
But we're together!

1051
01:56:32,527 --> 01:56:34,321
And it's going to be an adventure!

1052
01:56:34,404 --> 01:56:37,491
I'm starting a full-time job
at a publishing house.

1053
01:56:37,574 --> 01:56:40,535
But you're a chemist.

1054
01:56:40,619 --> 01:56:42,871
I know, but your dad
hasn't sent us any money.

1055
01:56:43,288 --> 01:56:44,873
And teaching isn't enough.

1056
01:56:45,790 --> 01:56:49,127
And I love books!
And I never really liked chemistry.

1057
01:56:51,129 --> 01:56:52,547
It'll be another adventure.

1058
01:56:54,132 --> 01:56:56,635
And we must stay together, really close.

1059
01:56:57,844 --> 01:56:58,803
Right, Cleo?

1060
01:56:59,304 --> 01:57:00,222
Yes.

1061
01:57:00,305 --> 01:57:02,098
Very, very close.

1062
01:57:02,182 --> 01:57:03,058
Hmm?

1063
01:57:04,309 --> 01:57:05,227
Darling?

1064
01:57:08,730 --> 01:57:09,856
Very close.

1065
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:11,566
Are you finished?

1066
01:57:12,359 --> 01:57:14,402
For dessert, we have ice cream.

1067
01:57:15,028 --> 01:57:17,364
Coconut, strawberry,

1068
01:57:17,447 --> 01:57:19,241
vanilla, banana,

1069
01:57:19,324 --> 01:57:20,367
and flan.

1070
01:57:33,547 --> 01:57:35,006
Ready for the picture.

1071
01:58:40,655 --> 01:58:41,948
Are you coming in?

1072
01:58:42,032 --> 01:58:44,284
No, I have to go check the tires.

1073
01:58:44,367 --> 01:58:46,786
We're leaving early tomorrow.
Want to come?

1074
01:58:46,870 --> 01:58:49,456
- No, it's our last day.
- I want to stay too.

1075
01:58:49,539 --> 01:58:52,876
Okay, but no swimming. Cleo can't swim.

1076
01:58:52,959 --> 01:58:56,421
- But it's really calm.
- If you want to stay, that's the rule.

1077
01:58:56,838 --> 01:58:59,883
- Near the shore?
- Okay. But only near the shore.

1078
01:58:59,966 --> 01:59:02,135
- Yes!
- Can I swim too, Mom?

1079
01:59:02,218 --> 01:59:04,638
- Yes, but only near the shore.
- Yeah!

1080
01:59:04,721 --> 01:59:07,015
Can you watch over them?
I won't be long.

1081
01:59:10,352 --> 01:59:12,062
Stay close to the shore!

1082
01:59:18,443 --> 01:59:20,153
Come, I'll clean you up.

1083
01:59:22,030 --> 01:59:24,032
Paco! You heard your mom.

1084
01:59:24,366 --> 01:59:25,992
Otherwise, you're getting out.

1085
01:59:32,832 --> 01:59:35,251
Sofi! Paco! Closer to the shore!

1086
01:59:50,141 --> 01:59:51,309
Paco!

1087
01:59:52,102 --> 01:59:55,939
When I was older, I used to be a sailor.

1088
01:59:56,022 --> 01:59:57,065
Uh-huh.

1089
01:59:57,148 --> 02:00:00,985
But I drowned in a storm.

1090
02:00:01,069 --> 02:00:02,028
Mm-hmm.

1091
02:00:02,612 --> 02:00:05,990
The waves were huge!

1092
02:00:07,283 --> 02:00:09,953
Sofi! Paco! Near the shore!

1093
02:00:10,995 --> 02:00:12,789
It was dark,

1094
02:00:13,373 --> 02:00:17,293
and there was lightning,
and I didn't know how to swim.

1095
02:00:17,377 --> 02:00:18,628
Wait here.

1096
02:00:22,424 --> 02:00:24,509
Paco! Come closer!

1097
02:00:29,639 --> 02:00:30,890
Sofi!

1098
02:00:34,185 --> 02:00:35,937
Paco, help your sister!

1099
02:00:55,832 --> 02:00:56,958
Sofi!

1100
02:01:07,177 --> 02:01:08,219
Paco!

1101
02:01:13,767 --> 02:01:14,851
Paco!

1102
02:01:19,063 --> 02:01:20,023
Paco!

1103
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:25,320
Sofi!

1104
02:01:28,156 --> 02:01:29,157
Sofi!

1105
02:01:40,001 --> 02:01:41,127
Sofi!

1106
02:01:45,089 --> 02:01:46,049
Sofi.

1107
02:02:43,314 --> 02:02:47,151
What happened? Are you okay, my love?

1108
02:02:48,152 --> 02:02:49,529
Cleo saved us.

1109
02:02:50,405 --> 02:02:52,198
Thank you... Thank you.

1110
02:02:53,241 --> 02:02:54,284
Are you okay?

1111
02:02:57,453 --> 02:03:00,290
- I didn't want her.
- What?

1112
02:03:02,709 --> 02:03:05,545
- I didn't want her.
- They're okay.

1113
02:03:09,132 --> 02:03:11,509
I didn't want her to be born.

1114
02:03:16,598 --> 02:03:18,224
We love you so much, Cleo.

1115
02:03:19,225 --> 02:03:21,019
- Right?
- Poor little thing.

1116
02:03:25,481 --> 02:03:27,525
We love you so, so much.

1117
02:04:31,839 --> 02:04:33,299
I love you, Cleo.

1118
02:04:33,925 --> 02:04:35,593
I love you too, darling.

1119
02:05:31,190 --> 02:05:34,944
Hey, Toño, Sofi, Paco, come help.
Don't play dumb.

1120
02:05:38,781 --> 02:05:39,991
Hi, Borras.

1121
02:05:45,997 --> 02:05:47,498
- Hi, Adela.
- Hi.

1122
02:05:48,124 --> 02:05:50,001
- Hi, Adela.
- Hello, kids.

1123
02:05:50,084 --> 02:05:51,836
- Hi, Adela.
- Welcome back.

1124
02:05:53,629 --> 02:05:55,256
- Hi, Adela.
- Welcome, ma'am.

1125
02:05:55,339 --> 02:05:57,300
- Can I leave this with you?
- Yes, ma'am.

1126
02:06:03,097 --> 02:06:04,390
It looks awful.

1127
02:06:05,349 --> 02:06:07,727
Without the bookshelves, it's awful.

1128
02:06:08,603 --> 02:06:10,271
I like it like this.

1129
02:06:11,606 --> 02:06:12,690
It's awful.

1130
02:06:13,399 --> 02:06:16,360
- What's awful, Mommy?
- He misses the bookshelves.

1131
02:06:16,944 --> 02:06:19,405
- Which bookshelves?
- The ones that were there.

1132
02:06:19,489 --> 02:06:21,365
[ I'm going to make dinner. ]

1133
02:06:21,449 --> 02:06:24,327
[ I have so much to tell you. ]

1134
02:06:25,870 --> 02:06:28,039
- Hello, how was it?
- Good.

1135
02:06:28,122 --> 02:06:29,624
They've switched the rooms!

1136
02:06:29,707 --> 02:06:31,709
- Where's mine?
- Over here, love.

1137
02:06:31,793 --> 02:06:34,587
- Why change them?
- It's better this way.

1138
02:06:34,670 --> 02:06:37,381
- I liked the old way better.
- Go check yours.

1139
02:06:37,465 --> 02:06:39,425
- How did it go?
- Hi, ma'am.

1140
02:06:39,509 --> 02:06:41,803
- Sofi and Paco almost drowned.
- Oh, no!

1141
02:06:41,886 --> 02:06:44,680
Hi, Cleo. Mrs. Sofi's room is there.

1142
02:06:44,764 --> 02:06:45,681
Thank you.

1143
02:06:46,015 --> 02:06:49,769
It's bigger.

1144
02:06:50,770 --> 02:06:54,273
- Cleo, check out my room!
- In a bit, okay?

1145
02:06:54,357 --> 02:06:57,193
Wow, it's much bigger!

1146
02:06:58,194 --> 02:07:00,238
I love it, Mom!

1147
02:07:00,321 --> 02:07:03,449
And we'll have
more adventures! We'll travel a lot.

1148
02:07:06,410 --> 02:07:07,703
- Hello?
- Disneyland!

1149
02:07:07,787 --> 02:07:12,416
We can't afford Disney,
but we can go to Oaxaca.

1150
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:16,337
- Yes, and visit Cleo's village.
- Great idea!

1151
02:07:16,420 --> 02:07:19,507
Sure, whenever you like.
Mrs. Molly is on the phone.

1152
02:07:19,590 --> 02:07:20,633
Ah, thank you.

1153
02:07:21,217 --> 02:07:23,094
Tell me, you almost drowned?

1154
02:07:23,177 --> 02:07:24,720
Yes, the current pulled us.

1155
02:07:24,804 --> 02:07:29,392
- The waves were 15 meters tall.
- No, they were only two meters.

1156
02:07:29,475 --> 02:07:33,062
- No, they were taller!
- And Cleo saved us. Right, Cleo?

1157
02:07:33,729 --> 02:07:36,023
- Cleo, can I have a banana smoothie?
- Yes.

1158
02:07:36,107 --> 02:07:37,692
- Me too.
- Are there any Twinkies?

1159
02:07:37,775 --> 02:07:41,320
- Let me check.
- Yes, I got a box.

1160
02:07:55,918 --> 02:07:57,587
[ Wait. ] Where are you going?

1161
02:07:57,670 --> 02:08:01,340
- [ We need ham. ]
- [ I have so much to tell you. ]

1162
02:08:01,424 --> 02:08:04,385
- [ Did you have a good time? ]
- [ Yes, it was very nice. ]

1163
02:08:04,468 --> 02:08:05,887
[ I'll be back soon. ]

1164
02:08:05,970 --> 02:08:08,639
[ But just get the ham. No flirting. ]

1165
02:08:44,508 --> 02:08:49,847
For Libo
