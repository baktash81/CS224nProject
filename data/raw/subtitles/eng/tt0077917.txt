181
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,640
So to speak, I've come
on a matter of business.

182
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,080
Allow me to introduce myself.

183
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,640
Billy Baker,

184
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,320
known at home and abroad
as "the Burmazi Kid."

185
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,760
- I'm pleased to meet you, Mr.
Baker,

186
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,960
but you see, I've got
nothing to do with boxing.

187
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,560
I just book acts.

188
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,640
- But I have an act, sir.

189
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,720
Me and Matilda.

190
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,560
- Matilda?

191
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,320
What kind of act do you do?

192
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,200
- We've got the greatest
boxing act in the world, sir.

193
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,680
- You box a lady?

194
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,680
- Oh no, Matilda isn't a lady.

195
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,560
He's a "he."

196
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,400
He's the greatest boxing
roo in the world.

197
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,400
- A what?

198
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,280
- A roo.

199
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,240
A kangaroo.

200
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,040
- Oh.

201
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,880
- A roo!

202
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,600
A boxing kangaroo, governor.

203
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,120
[laughing]

204
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,320
- I had a pair of slippers
once made out of kangaroo.

205
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,000
- Nobody's buying
animal acts today.

206
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,680
Maybe six months from now.

207
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,800
- Well it's not just an act,
sir.

208
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,200
Matilda is the greatest
boxer in the world.

209
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,840
Well, no fighter has ever gone
more than two round with him.

210
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,360
- Sign him, buddy.

211
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,720
He's the first guy I ever met

212
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,960
who's even a bigger
loser than you.

213
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,360
I can't stand it anymore.

214
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,240
Come on, Champ.

215
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,800
[laughing]

216
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,720
A roo.

217
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,240
A boxing kangaroo.

218
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,760
- Look at those sad, lonely eyes

219
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,280
full of expressions of love.

220
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,080
He's in a dog jail now,
just at this minute.

221
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,520
He's like a son to me, Mr.
Bonnelli.

222
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,760
He's all I've got in the world.

223
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,000
- Look, Mr. Baker,

224
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,040
I'm sorry, I wish I could
help you but, you see,

225
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,600
the fact is, I can barely
help myself nowadays.

226
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,960
I'm sorry.

227
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,560
[somber music]

228
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,720
- No.

229
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,600
No.

230
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,040
I couldn't eat knowing

231
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,360
Matilda's starving in a
prison somewhere.

232
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,480
[somber music]

233
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,480
[tires screeching]

234
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,320
- Hey!

235
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,440
You wanna pay?

236
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,680
- Keep it running, we'll
be out in a minute.

237
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,560
Excuse me, lady.

238
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,360
- You won't be sorry for this,
Mr. Bernie.

239
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,840
I promise you that, I promise.

240
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,880
- Hello, I'd like to...

241
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,920
Sir?

242
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,200
Sir?

243
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,400
Hello, could you help us,
please?

244
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,280
Mister, sir?

245
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,120
Hello?

246
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,880
- Mister, officer, officer,

247
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,520
I've come for my kangaroo,
Matilda.

248
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,920
- Did you now?

249
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,440
We get a lot of kangaroos here,
hundreds.

250
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,480
- Mister,

251
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,280
would you look at it, please?

252
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,720
Please, please, will
you look at it?

253
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,960
- Which one's yours?

254
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,480
- Well, he's about as...

255
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,240
Well, he's about as
big as you are.

256
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,280
But he's got the most
beautiful grayish fur.

257
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,960
- Look, bub, we got
enough weird animals

258
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,440
around here already.

259
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,680
Maybe you two better
be moving on

260
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,000
before I run you in for
disturbing the peace!

261
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,080
- Eddie!

262
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,840
Eddie, these people are serious.

263
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,520
They love their pet as well
as you love your children.

264
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,240
- I hate my children, Smith.

265
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,720
What's with that kangaroo?

266
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,600
- You're right, ma'am, that
kangaroo is like a son to him

267
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,360
and me.

268
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,800
- They're checking to
see who got gassed today.

269
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,160
- Gassed?

270
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,040
- Gassed?

271
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,800
- If anything happened to
this man's son,

272
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,760
we'll sue everybody!

273
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,880
The city, the state!

274
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,800
- No, no, the worst that
could've happened

275
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,520
is they've taken him to the zoo.

276
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,760
- A zoo?

277
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,720
But...

278
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,440
But Matilda isn't a wild animal.

279
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,960
- You guys think you
can take an innocent kid

280
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,760
and throw him behind bars?

281
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,120
No way!

282
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,960
- Eddie, you see, that's
exactly what I'm talking about.

283
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,160
You're not only totally

284
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,880
insensitive to animals
but people,

285
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,800
these are people
and they have feelings.

286
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,240
- Yeah, we have feelings.

287
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,760
By the way, my name is Bonnelli,

288
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,040
Bernie Bonnelli.

289
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,960
I'm a theatrical agent.

290
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,160
- Why, I'm Kathleen
Smith and I've worked for

291
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,440
the Association For the

292
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,240
Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals.

293
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,480
- Oh.

294
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,520
- [Billy] That's him!

295
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,360
That's Matilda.

296
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,320
They found him!

297
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,400
- Okay, wise guys.

298
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,760
Come and get that
kangaroo out of here

299
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,600
and get him out of here
but quick or we'll gas him.

300
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,960
He just boxed one of out
guys in there.

301
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,920
You better hope he ain't dead.

302
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,040
- He knocked him out?

303
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,840
- Zap, one punch and
poor Stanley,

304
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,680
he awfully had a pounding and
laying on his back smiling.

305
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,760
Out like a light.

306
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,280
- Matilda wouldn't hurt anybody.

307
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,600
He was just playing.

308
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
He loves to box.

309
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,120
- [Billy Voiceover] Things
were looking up

310
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,160
until Bernie invited Miss
Smith to watch Matilda box,

311
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,360
then she nearly went bonkers.

312
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,800
- Well I'm very sorry
but I cannot allow this.

313
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,200
- I can't believe this woman.

314
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,640
- I said, I will not
permit this!

315
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,880
- Listen, lady,

316
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,960
I have always suspected
people like you

317
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,520
who do goody-good things
for animals and whatever.

318
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,680
There's something inside
of them, in their lives,

319
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,400
that ain't working.

320
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,800
Something empty.

321
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,280
So fill yourself up with
something besides my marsupial.

322
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,840
[silly music]

323
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,200
- What the hell is that?

324
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,160
- My first wife, come in.

325
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,440
- Look, just forget about it.

326
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,760
Just give me my money
and I'll get out of here.

327
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,840
- Here's an extra 50, come on.

328
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,120
- Hey, what're you guys, a joke?

329
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,440
I've got my meter running
for over an hour now.

330
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,560
- What're you complaining
about, making money?

331
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,320
Here, see?

332
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,960
That's just the tip, okay?

333
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,480
[silly music]

334
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,280
- All right, whatever
she does in that cab,

335
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,880
you guys have to clean up.

336
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,960
- Listen, mister,

337
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,480
that kangaroo is as
clean as you are.

338
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,480
And he can hold his
water like a camel.

339
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,840
[silly music]

340
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,360
- Would I ever lie to you, Mr.
Donohue?

341
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,000
- Don't talk to me like
we met five minutes ago.

342
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,400
I can't remember the last
time you told me the truth.

343
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,280
- Oh, I was just trying
to help Pinky, you know?

344
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,360
Lying to family doesn't count.

345
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,520
But now I'm telling you
for real, Mr. Donohue.

346
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,760
This is the greatest
fighter that ever walked.

347
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,640
Hopped.

348
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,880
- Look,

349
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,760
cut the bologna, Bonnelli,
it ain't necessary.

350
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,280
The only reason I let this
misguided creature in here

351
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,560
is because I like you.

352
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,440
- Thanks, Mr. Donohue.

353
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,720
Okay, let's do it!
[clapping]

354
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,240
- What's happening?

355
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,520
What's going on?

356
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,200
- [Man] He's putting a
little class in the joint.

357
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,080
[bell ringing]

358
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,880

I'm telling you, Dockerty
is gonna be here tonight.

00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,920
Fighting.

539
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,600

[crowd commotion]

541
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,880

00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,200
Just like I told you, huh, Mr.
Parkhurst?

557
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,960

So, if you wanna fight...
[booing]

574
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,360
If you wanna fight, you
gotta come up into the ring

575
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,560
and sign a release!

576
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,960
- This must be a fake.

577
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,920
Tell 'em champ, they'll
listen to you, tell 'em!

578
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,440

579
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:03,320
- Do I gather that you
are challenging Matilda?!

580
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,000
- You bet your sweet
patootie I am!

581
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,400
- I don't believe it.

582
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,760
He's signing to fight
that kangaroo

583
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,000
and he wouldn't fight
Cyclone Roberts.

584
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,520
[crowd applauding]

585
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,320

a man to do.

[laughing]

587
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,920
- The last one to get
knocked down

588
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,440
must go to the farthest
corner, remain there until--

589
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,920
- That's the Heavyweight
Champion of the world.

590
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,040
You didn't tell me Matilda
would have to fight him.

591
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,080
- Relax, kid, everything's
gonna be all right.

592
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,600
- But he's all I've got.

593
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,720
- All right, shake hands!

594
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,960

him get hurt.

[crowd cheering]

608
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,080
- [Billy Voiceover] Nobody
in the boxing world knew

609
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,600
that a big underworld
boss called Uncle Nono

610
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,960
owned the champ, Lee Dockerty.

611
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,160
He didn't like what
had happened.

612
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,320
- "Don't kiss me again!

- Listen, boss.

637
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,840
- Why did you let Dockerty
out of your sight?

638
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,440
That's what you're
being paid for.

To see that Parkhurst does
not get another chance

640

to write this kind of junk!

[snapping]

642

was desperate for a girl.

Where were you?!

He works in the same
office with Bernie.

650
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,320
- I work for the same office?

651
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,800
That idiot is my brother-in-law,

652
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,480
otherwise I would've
thrown him out years ago!

You see, he was an orphan.

life and I was gonna give--

00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,480
Your sister's brother
is an orphan

659

00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,360
Why is this?!

out of my office!

You, Bernie Bonnelli,
are a Judas!

Would you mind explaining
the meaning of this?

675
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,480
- The meaning is simple.

676
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,520
I'm gonna kill you.

677
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,080
- Wait, the boss don't
want no one hit.

678
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,320
- Shut up, you nitwit!

679

me with your numbers.

can't put this stuff

out here in the hallway
and just leave it!

you on the top!

you a rematch.

There was never a match.

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,840
It was only some dopey
publicity stunt you dreamed up!

- Yeah!

wrong peoples mad.

- What's Parkhurst
wanna see me about?

695

- I don't know but when
Parkhurst wants to see you,

696
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,920
you go, not later, not
tomorrow but now.

697
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,920
- If it's important, it's
gotta be something good, right?

698
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,120
- Hello, Betty.

699
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,000
This is Bernie Bonnelli.

700
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,320
Mr. Parkhurst wants to see him.

701
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,520
- He's waiting, please go in.

702
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,080
Gordon, Mr. Parkhurst wants
to see him in private.

703

- Sit down.

- I'm Bernie Bonnelli.

705
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,280
Matilda's manager.

706
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,480
- Yeah, I know who you are,
that's why you're here.

707
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,800
- Okay, what do you want?

708
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,240
- Do you know who owns Dockerty?

709
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,800
- Pinky Schwab and a
couple other guys.

710
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,600
- Pink Schwab is just one
step below of being a moron.

711
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,800
Uncle Nono owns Dockerty, kid.

712
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,800
He's the biggest gangster
in the United States

713
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,200
and I'm going to put him
put of boxing for good.

714

715
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,400
- You and Billy Baker
have a good thing going

716
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,680
with Matilda right now but so
far it's just a circus act.

717
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,520
But I'm going to make it better.

718
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,360
You do what I tell you,

719
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,520
you'll make money and I'll
get Uncle Nono.

720
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,720
- I got a feeling you
get Nono, I get buried.

721
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,520
- That's the gamble
you're gonna have to take

722
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,600
if you wanna make a
million bucks.

723
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,520
- A million bucks?!

724
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,640
- That's what it's worth

725
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,520
to get Dockerty in the
ring with Matilda.

726
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,680
You interested?

727
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,400
- Is Rolls interested in Royce?

728
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,240
- Okay.

729
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,480
Now you arrange the fights,

730
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,720
I write about them.

731
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,040
Nobody knows about our deal.

732
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,560
So when Nono comes down on you,

733
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,280
you keep your mouth
shut, you don't call me.

734
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,400
We understand each other?

735
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,640
- You got yourself a deal, Mr.
Parkhurst.

736
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,920
- Oh, incidentally,
very important,

737
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,800
you take care of Kathleen
Smith and the ASPCA first.

738
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,320
I hear on the grape vine that
she's taking you to court.

739
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,720
- She is being taken care
of immediately.

740
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,040
- [Gordon] Are you sure
this is the place?

741
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,280
- [Bernie] Sure I'm sure,
can't you read English?

742
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,440
- [Gordon] Don't get mad,
I'm only asking.

743
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,320

745
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,560
- Come on, come on, good dogs.

746
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,480
Come on, come on, come on.

747
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,440
Come on, sweetie.

748
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,400
Hey.

749
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,400
Come on, come one,
what a nice dog.

750
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,040
[dogs barking]

751
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,480
- Come on, Charlie.

752
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,320
[dogs barking]

753
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,160
- Hi!

754
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,200
Fancy meeting you out here.

755
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,360
Do you live here?

756
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,440
I walk down this
street every day.

757
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,200
Hello.

758
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,640
- How nice, Mr. Bonnelli.

759
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,520
- This is the part of the
day I always look forward to,

760
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,000
to be with my animals.

761
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,400
They're mostly strays
I picked up.

762
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,240
I can't stand to see an
animal suffer.

763
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,840
- Mr. Bonnelli, why do I
get this feeling

764
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,120
there's something you're
trying so hard to tell me?

765
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,680
- Miss Smith, you've
got me wrong.

766
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,080
When I wanna tell
somebody something,

767
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,120
I tell them straight out.

768
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,480
Like the whole Matilda thing.

769
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,560
Do you really think
that I would ever, ever

770
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,800
let anybody hurt him?

771
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840
I mean, that kangaroo's
like family to me.

772
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,840
- Family?

773
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,720
People don't exploit
their family.

774
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,080
- But who's exploiting anybody?

775
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,200
Do you think anyone can
teach a kangaroo to fight?

776
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,800
No way, it's a natural thing.

777
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,000
It's their sex drive.

778
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,040
God gave it to them just
like He gave it to us.

779
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,400
They fight and we...

780
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,200
How tall are you?

781
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,360
- What?

782
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,880
- I mean, you sure got long
legs for a lady your size,

783
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,080
you know that?

784
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,680
[dogs barking]

785
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,800
- My injunction is
going to stand.

786
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,640
Matilda is not going
to fight again.

787
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,640
Will you excuse me, please?

788
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,760
- Miss Smith, listen to me!

789
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,840
[dogs barking]

790
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,760
Ow, ow, ow!

791
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,520
Oh, you bit me, ow!

792
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,000
[Gordon laughing]

793
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,840
- Sit down.

794
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,760
Come on, sit.

795
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,240
Here, hold Charlie.

796
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,400
Let's take the shoe off.

797
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,240
No, we must take the shoe off

798
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,320
to see if the skin is broke.

799
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,600
- No, it's nothing, really.

800
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,880
[dogs barking]

801
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,840
- My goodness.

802
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,960
Why am I so disappointed

803
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,280
that you are not bleeding, Mr.
Bonnelli?

804
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,720
- What?

805
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,840
- You know, it's just amazing
that for a man your size,

806
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,000
your legs are so ugly.

807
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,560
That must do terrible
things for your ego.

808
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,880
Can I have Charlie, please?

809
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,240
- What are you, some
kind of sadist working

810
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,200
for the Prevention of
Cruelty for Animals?

811
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,400
- I can tell you this,
I've never been so inspired

812
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,760
to stop anyone as I am now, Mr.
Bonnelli.

813
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,880
[dog whimpering]

814
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,240
Oh,

815
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,760
here boys.

816
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,640
Here, fellas.

817
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,880
Fetch!

818

[dogs barking]

819
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,520
- What're you doing?

820
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,480
What're you, crazy?!

821
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,040
- Fetch, Bonnelli.

822
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,440
Fetch.

- You know what that was
all about, don't you?

826
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,280
- Yeah, guess she didn't
go for it, huh?

827
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,280
- You think she really cares
about stopping a fight?

828
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,680
That's her way to
sticking it to my life

829
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,160
and you know something?

830
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,880
I don't think she can fight
it, what do you think of that?

831

- Who?

834
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,480
- Well Miss Smith is gonna
have to learn the hard way.

835
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,160
No more Mr. Nice Guy!

836
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,000
We'll be gone, fighting
around the country,

while my long-legged
friend spends her life

injunction against us

839

Gordon, partner,

841
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,680
you ever think of
selling this cab?

[upbeat music]

843
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,480
- [Billy Voiceover] For
the next six months,

844
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,240
we crisscrossed the
United States taking on

845
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,160
every contender for the title.

00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,160
Slowly working our way
to a championship fight.

847
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,560
We went to some very
strange places.

Tuskaloosa, Chattanooga.

Minneapolis.

853
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,440
We had seven fights

854
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,520
and Matilda killed 'em
all in the first round.

855
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,680
It was very tiring but
it was all happy

856
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,840
being one family, so to speak.

857
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,240
Bernie, bless his heart,

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,080
was saving some money for us all

859
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,240
but he always insisted, even
though we didn't spend a lot,

860
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,760
we always ate good.

861
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,600
- Thanks.

862
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,640
- Oh, just a minute, sir.

863
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,000
- Oh.

864
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,480
That's a sundae for Matilda.

865
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,600

- Hello.

871
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,320
What're you doing?

872
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,840
What are you doing?

873
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,800
- Do you really think you could
stop me by leaving New York?

874
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,680
- I tried calling to say
goodbye but your phone was busy.

875
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,680
- Oh, well why didn't
you write me a letter?

876
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,840
I got the bill for your shoes.

877
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,680
- Well, those were
Bally loafers.

878
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,600
- Oh, well, they only ate one.

879
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,480
- I'm sorry.

880

Eat one, you gotta pay for two.

881
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,880
Did you follow me to Oklahoma?

- Oh.

886
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,680
- [Kathleen] They
wouldn't grant it.

- Oh.

888
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,520

where your next fight is
in Los Angeles.

- Oh, my brother's the
boxing commissioner

892
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,400

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,040
Come in!

896
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,120
Just leave it there in
the front room, please.

897
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,920
[pleasant music]

898
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,600
Get out!

899
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,760
- Listen, I want to be friends.

900
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,960
Can we be friends?

901
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,560
- No, get out!

902
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,640
- Most women, when they
come out of the shower

903
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,960
and they're in a bathrobe
and their hair's like that

904
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,240
are supposed to look
pretty but they never do.

905
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,320
You

906
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,200
do.

907
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,360
It's not great but
it's friendly.

908
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,240
Here.

909
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,560
[splashing]

910
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,160
[lips smacking]

911
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,720
It's not great but
it's friendly.

912
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,000
- I never thought that it
was possible to hate anybody

913
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,520
as much as I hate you but I
have achieved the impossible.

914
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,080
When are you gonna give it up?!

915
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,840
- It's great but it's
not friendly.

916
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,560
- I have this curious notion
that you have come up here

917
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,760
to try and tell me something

918
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,880
and you just don't know
quite how to say it.

919
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,920
- I'm not kidding, I
wanna be friends.

920
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,440
- Oh, is it my
irresistible beauty

921
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,880
or does it have something
to do with the fact

922
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,120
that my brother is the head of

923
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,200
the boxing commission
of California?

924
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,360
- The honest answer to that
is "yes to both," why not?

925
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,440
I'm fighting for the life
of a man and a marsupial

926
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,000
that I give a damn about.

927
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,680
Someday, if we really get
to be friends,

928
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,120
I'll tell you about what
I think of the

929
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,240
prevention of cruelty to people.

930
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,640
You keep talking
about marsupials.

931
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,720
Did you happen to see my
English friend

932
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,520
who was once Welterweight
Champion of England?

933
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,760
That's important, lady!

934
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,760
I don't think you understand
how important that is,

935
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,920
that a man who was
Welterweight Champion

936
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,560
is suddenly walking on his
knees starving to death

937
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,120
and has nothing but a one-way
ticket to the poor house.

938
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,240
That might not mean
anything to you

939
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,200
but it means something to me!

940
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,440
Here.

941
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,840
Have a shoe.

942
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,440
I'll send you a bill
in the morning.

943
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,520
[door slamming]

944
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,040
[silly music]

945
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,360
- [Bernardo] Okay, we
throw a net over the beast

946
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,880
and this time we kidnap him!

947
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,120
- [Macante] Even if we
kidnap the kangaroo,

948
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,480
how're we gonna get them
in this trunk?

949
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,960
- He's no bigger than a body.

950
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,120
You, are you sure it's gonna
be here, this kangaroo?

951
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,200
- I told you for the last time,

952
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,320
he comes up and down this trail.

953
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,000
- Well I'm just checking, I
don't want no more trouble!

954
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,400
[men grumbling]

955
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,840
Now go!
- Come on.

956
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,080
- [Bernardo] I hope this
works because if it doesn't,

957
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,040
the boss finds out, it's
concrete Keds for us.

958
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,000
[men arguing]

959
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,720
- Come on, would you
please hurry up?!

960
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,560
- [Bernardo] All right,
all right, all right!

961
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,520
- When I give the signal,
drop it right here!

962
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,480
- All right, we hear you!

963
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,160
Only a moron would try
to kidnap this beast.

964
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,440
This is ridiculous!

965
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,120
[ominous music]

966
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,360
[Matilda cooing]

967
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,320
[thudding]

968
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,200
- Throw it!

969
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,760
What is this beast?

970
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,800
He's killin', he choking me!

971
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,080
Help, he's choke!

972
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,200
[gagging]

973
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,400
- We gotta get Macante out!

974
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,520
- What's the problem?

975
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,360
Simple!

976
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,280
[thudding]
- [Macante] Ow!

977
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,120
Get me out of this!

978
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,440
Ow, you idiot,
what're you doing?!

979
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,160
- Stupid, hit the one
with the big ears!

980
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,560
- I'll hit you in your big ears!

981
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,960
[gagging]

982
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,040
- I'm gonna feel around,

983
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,840
when I don't feel no fur,

984
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,520
Tito's gonna lift up the net
and we're gonna let you out!

985
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,560
Capeesh?!

986
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,000
- All right, get out, get out!

987
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,000
[thudding]

988
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,080
- [Macante] Hey, I'm
still in here!

989
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,040
Hey, you!

990
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,000
- [Bernardo] Move! Move!

991
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:41,840
Let's get out of here!

992
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,120
Go! Go! Go! Go!

993
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,920
[tires screeching]

994
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,720
[pleasant music]

995
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,960
- Ladies and gentleman,
your attention please,

996
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,480
this is the main event
of the evening.

997
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,440
[crowd cheering]

998
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,160
10 rounds of heavyweight boxing.

999
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,760
Introducing to you first,

1000
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,240
at a hundred and 87 pounds,

1001
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,160
from Sydney, Australia,
the great Matilda!

1002
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,960
[crowd cheering]

1003
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,560
And in this corner,

1004
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,360
wearing blue trunks with
the gold stripes,

1005
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,160
one hundred and 96 and
a half pounds,

1006
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,200
from Stillwater, Oklahoma,

1007
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,360
the number two champion
in the world,

1008
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,320
Cowboy Joe!

1009
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,880
[crowd cheering]

1010
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,680
[crowd shouting]

1011
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,520
[bell ringing]

1012
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,880
[thudding]

1013
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,760
[crowd cheering]

1014
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,360
[upbeat music]

1015
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,280
- [Billy] Bernie, I hope
you don't mind,

1016
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,560
but when you see Miss Kathleen's
brother, don't upset him.

1017
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,360
If we don't get the
license for the fight,

1018
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,240
we've come all this way
to California for nothing.

1019
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,840
[upbeat music]

1020
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,600
- You propose to stage a
ten round fight

1021
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,160
between a former
Middleweight Champion,

1022
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,440
Cyclone Roberts of Peoria,

1023
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,760
and a kangaroo?

1024
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,520
- [Bernie] That's right.

1025
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,600
- And you're asking us to
issue a license for this?

1026
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,120
What do you take us for, Mr.
Bonnelli?

1027
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,240
- I'm not talking
anybody for anything.

1028
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,800
My fighter, Matilda, ain't
no ordinary kangaroo.

1029
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,920
Knocked out Lee Dockerty
and 11 other guys.

1030
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,200
He's licensed in 10 states
and is a serious contender

1031
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,360
for the championship.

1032
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,640
- You won't get a license
in California.

1033
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,120
- Why not?

1034
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:18,680
- We'll not allow that kind
of a freak show in this state.

1035
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,680
Take your circus and
get out of town.

1036
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,640
- I told your sister
and now I'm telling you,

1037
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,080
you don't run this world
because you don't own it!

1038
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,880
[pleasant music]

1039
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,520
Who do those people
think they are?

1040
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,480
"Freak show."

1041
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,600
I ain't been around
all these years

1042
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,680
to have that brother and
sister act stop us now.

1043
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,960
Nothing, nothing stops Bonnelli!

1044
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,280
Take me to Herman Caplin.

1045
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,480
- [Billy] Who's Herman Caplin?

1046
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,480
- [Bernie] A friend.

1047
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,280
- [Billy] What does he do,
Bernie?

1048
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,080
- He runs a big
advertising agency.

1049
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,560
[upbeat music]

1050
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,240
I did it, I did it, I did it!

1051
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,760
We are gonna be on TV.

1052
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,920
I sold the television show to
my old friend, Herman Caplin!

1053
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:18,800
- A television show?

1054
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,800
- Right!

1055
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,400
Matilda boxes Cyclone
on the show.

1056
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,120
It's a phony story but
everybody knows

1057
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,320
the fight's for real
in the studio

1058
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,440
and they get into the ring.

1059
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,480
- Oh, Bernie, you're
infinitely special.

1060
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,720
- Do you know something?
- What?

1061
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,000
- I should've been a
genius or something.

1062
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,280
[laughing]

1063
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,560
- [Gordon] You mean a TV show

1064
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,800
that has the real fight in it,
huh?

1065
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,240
That's terrific!

1066
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,760
[Gordon laughing]

1067
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,480
- All right.

1068
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,400
I'm gonna teach you the
advantages of an education.

1069
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,680
Come on.

1070
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,040
All right.

1071
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,400
Now,

1072
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,520
here we have our champ,
Dockerty.

1073
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,040
Observe.

1074
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,960
He is a human being.

1075
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,840
He has two legs, huh?

1076
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,280
See the dots?

1077
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,480
One.

1078
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,360
Two.

1079
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,320
Repeat.

1080
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,640
- [Men] One.

1081
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,480
Two.

1082
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,160
- All right, now here
we have our kangaroo.

1083
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,640
Now, can you tell me
the difference, Macante?

1084
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,520
Huh?

1085
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,400
- He's got a tail.

1086
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,120
[laughing]

1087
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,440
- That's beautiful, Macante!

1088
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,400
That's beautiful, beautiful!

1089
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,080
All right!

1090
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,960
But not just a tail,
not just a tail!

1091
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,360
Bernardo, what else do you see?

1092
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,400
- Yeah,

1093
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,920
he's got a long tail.

1094
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,640
- No, you stupid...

1095
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,080
What else do you see?

1096
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,760
- Oh.

1097
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,120
He's got skinny legs.

1098
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,320
- No, you idiot!

1099
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,240
He's got an extra dot!

1100
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,680
He's got three dots!

1101
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,040
This kangaroo's been
fighting with three dots!

1102
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,640
One, two, three!

1103
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,760
- [Men] One, two, three.

1104
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,560
- While Dockerty's only
fighting with two dots.

1105
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,600
One, two.

1106
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,480
- [Men] One, two.

1107
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,640
- That ain't fair, I'm
gonna call the commissioner.

1108
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,640
- And what're you gonna
tell the commissioner?

1109
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,400
- About the extra dot.

1110
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,880
- No, you stupid!

1111
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,440
You cut off the head of a
snake and the body dies.

1112
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,240
[thunder rumbling]

1113
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,760
You cut off the tail
of a kangaroo

1114
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,600
and what happens?

1115
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,800
Well, come on, what happens?!

1116
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:44,680
Huh?

1117
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,920
He looses his dot.

1118
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,640
His extra dot!

1119
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,840
He falls down, he can't
fight anymore.

1120
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,920
You understand?

1121
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,120
Do you understand or am
I talking to myself?!

1122
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,880
- Oh yeah, no, we
understand, he falls down!

1123
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,680
- Oh!

1124
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,360
[ominous music]

1125
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,040
[speaking foreign language]

1126
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,480
- Boss,

1127
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,520
are we really gonna put
out a contract

1128
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,240
to cut off the kangaroo's tail?

1129
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:20,560
- Boss.

1130
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,240
Please, no disrespect intended.

1131
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,440
Who am I gonna get to do this?

1132
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,080
A butcher?

1133
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:28,960
- No.

1134
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,200
Two of my best men.

1135
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,000
Both of you are gonna go
to Los Angeles

1136
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,000
and you're gonna chop it off!

1137
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,680
[ominous music]

1138
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,480
- [Bernie] Miss Smith
thought she was gonna get

1139
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,000
her little brother to stop
Bernie Bonnelli, ha, ha!

1140
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,440
Well, would you like to
see their faces

1141
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:51,400
when they see Matilda fight
Cyclone on TV, nationwide?!

1142
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,600
- [Kathleen
Voiceover] Dear Bernie,

1143
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,120
I'm sorry the fight
was called off.

1144
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,080
Can I buy you dinner?

1145
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,200
Can we be friends?

1146
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,920
[pleasant music]

1147
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,680
[phone ringing]

1148
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,320
- Hello?

1149
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,360
- Hello, Billy,

1150
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,480
listen, Billy, we
don't eat tonight.

1151
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,080
- We don't?

1152
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,360
- Together.

1153
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,800
I've been invited upstairs
to eat by Miss Smith.

1154
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,000
She's feeling guilty and
I'm going to her room now

1155
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,760
to make her meal
even more guilty

1156
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,080
because she things she
ruined our chances.

1157
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,680
Sweet dreams to you, Gordon
and Matilda, goodnight.

1158
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,840
[pleasant music]

1159
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,840
Forgive me but if the
shoes fits...

1160
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,160
[doorbell ringing]

1161
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,960
[somber music]

1162
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,760
- Come in.

1163
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,120
Please, come in.

1164
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,840
Are you all right?

1165
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,960
Would you like something to eat?

1166
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
- I don't wanna eat.

1167
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,440
- Drink?

1168
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,280
Maybe you'd like
something to drink.

1169
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,880
- What difference does it make?

1170
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,720
- I've never seen you like this.

1171
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,240
Your voice is even different.

1172
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,640
Here.

1173
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,520
Here.

1174
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,280
I'll take the shoe.

1175
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,160
No, it's all right,
I'll give it back later

1176
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,960
and you can take it home.

1177
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:40,840
It's okay.

1178
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,080
- I'm a bum again.

1179
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:51,760
I'm on the outside looking in.

1180
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,000
I'm nothing.

1181
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,320
I'm a loser.

1182
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,240
- Oh,

1183
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,920
Lord,

1184
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,880
Bernie, you're
anything but a loser.

1185
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,720
You are the most amazing man
I have ever met in my life.

1186
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,120
Oh, Bernie.

1187
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:15,160
I've never seen a man
with such energy.

1188
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,840
And I've never seen a man
who tried with all his might

1189
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,280
to obtain the impossible.

1190
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,520
And, you know,

1191
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,240
you know, you almost succeeded.

1192
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,760
Don't you realize how
truly great you are?

1193
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,560
- I'm not thinking too clearly.

1194
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,680
I have a terrible headache.

1195
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,720
- Oh, a headache.

1196
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,000
[pleasant music]

1197
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,920
- As a matter of fact,
my whole neck.

1198
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,200
- Oh, your neck?

1199
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,080
- And my whole back.

1200
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,840
- Your back too?

1201
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:50,680
- Oh yes.

1202
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:51,600
Ah.

1203
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:52,480
Oh.

1204
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:54,360
Oh.

1205
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,520
Oh, I'll tell you something,
Miss Smith.

1206
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,360
- Yes?

1207
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,600
- You're in another world.

1208
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,480
You don't understand, I
get a chance like this

1209
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,720
once in a lifetime.

1210
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:09,880
It's gone, you don't get two
chances at something like this.

1211
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:11,760
Oh.

1212
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,360
Ah.

1213
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,360
[pleasant music]

1214
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,640
Can I have another drink,
please?

1215
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,000
- Sure.

1216
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:29,880
[pleasant instrumental music]

1217
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,920
Bernie, I think
you've had enough.

1218
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,200
- God, if you only knew
what I have to go though.

1219
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,280
I mean, I don't have any money

1220
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,360
and Billy's ruined and
Matilda's ruined

1221
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,440
and it's all my fault.

1222
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,320
- Oh, no.

1223
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,240
Bernie, no.

1224
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:59,720
It's the opposite,
absolutely the opposite.

1225
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,400
Here, sit up.

1226
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,120
Oh, Bernie, it's because
of you that they existed,

1227
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,240
that they even had the chance.

1228
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,680
They even had the chance.

1229
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,440
- But they don't have any
chance anymore, don't you see?

1230
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,640
- Oh, no, no.

1231
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:13,760
[shushing]

1232
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,320
I think you should just relax.

1233
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,600
Just relax for a little while.

1234
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,960
Okay?

1235
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,400
[pleasant music]

1236
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,280
Oh.

1237
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,080
That's it.

1238
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,040
Just relax.

1239
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,160
Relax.

1240
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:43,360
[ominous music]

1241
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,560
- Here they come.

1242
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,960
Now remember,

1243
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,520
when I ask the animal for
his autograph,

1244
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,760
you got just enough time
to do what you gotta do.

1245
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,920
Think, we get in the car,
we're gone

1246
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,320
and the dot's gone.

1247
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,560
Capeesh?

1248
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,520
- I know what I'm
supposed to do.

1249
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,840
[speaking foreign language]

1250
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:01,960
- I'm just checking.

1251
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,280
Why you always get upset
about everything?

1252
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,200
- When I'm through,

1253
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,800
the kangaroo's too.

1254
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:09,960
- I love you.

1255
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:17,760
Excuse me.

1256
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,440
Gentlemen?

1257
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,640
Excuse me, please, somebody?

1258
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:28,280
I'd like to get his autograph,
please?

1259
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,440
It's for my kid.

1260
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:30,600
- [Billy] Oh, oh.

1261
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,680
- [Bernardo] I really
would appreciate it.

1262
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,120
- Sign here.

1263
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,920
[Matilda cooing]

1264
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:39,800
- [Bernardo] Thanks a lot,
really.

1265
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,320
I really appreciated that.

1266
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,240
- Ah, look at you.

1267
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,800
[whooshing]

1268
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,280

[Matilda giggling]

1271
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,360
- [Billy Voiceover] Bernie's
idea of doing a show

1272
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,400
where Matilda fights
Cyclone Roberts

1273
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,600
was my debut as an actor.

1274
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,760
And if I must say so myself,

1275
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,120
it was a milestone in
television history.

1276
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,200
- Oh!

1277
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,200
- [Both] He's our Matilda

1278
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:13,440
that we saved in the desert
when he was just a little roo.

1279
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,280
- [Old Woman] Maybe
he'll pay us back

1280
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:20,720
by fighting that mean
Cyclone Roberts.

1281
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,560
- Do you believe this?

1282
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:23,960
Do you believe this?

1283
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,560
- Pardon me, ma'am, you
saved his life...

1284
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,680
Too.

1285
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,880
- [TV Narrator] Dear Matilda
agreed to fight Cyclone Roberts

1286
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,400
and give his share of the purse.

1287
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,600
- [Announcer] Okay, switch
cameras to the ring.

1288
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:39,160
[crowd shouting]

1289
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,120
And here we are, live,
from Olympia Auditorium

1290
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,200
where the boxing event
you've all been waiting for

1291
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,280
is about to begin!

1292
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,480
Matilda vs. Cyclone Roberts!

1293
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,560
[bell ringing]

1294
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,080
[crowd cheering]

1295
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,480
He knows Matilda can hit.

1296
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,400
He throws a jab.

1297
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,440
Way short.

1298
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:56,040
Cyclone dancing around now.

1299
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,160
Cyclone steps up.

1300
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,480
Pulls a jab, Matilda comes back.

1301
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,560
What a devastating
hook to the head!

1302
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,720
Cyclone is down!

1303
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:01,840
The referee is counting

1304
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,840
but it's a waste of time.

1305
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,520
Cyclone is out cold!

1306
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,040
That's it, it's all over.

1307
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,240
Once again, Matilda has
stopped his opponent

1308
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,320
in the first round!

1309
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,280
Listen to that crowd,
they love it!

1310
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:15,240

[phone ringing]

1316
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,040
- Ah, the great Bernie Bonnelli.

1317
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,480
The rope burner, the world
beater, the impresario!

1318
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,800
- This is Billy Baker,
the Burmazi Kid.

1319
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,080
- Glad to know you.

1320
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,240
You know, I used to think
you were just a hustler,

1321
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,920
but I guess I was wrong.

1322
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,880
- Coming from you, that
scares me, what's up?

1323
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,160
Why did you have us fly back?

1324
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,280
- Good news and bad news.

1325
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,960
The championship fight
is on in Reno.

1326
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:58,600
Congratulations.

1327
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,640
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

1328
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,200
- We've done it, Bernie,
we've done it!

1329
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,680
- Bad news is, you're
all working for free.

1330
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:07,960
- [Both] Free?

1331
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,880
- You heard me, for free.

1332
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,240
Nobody gets anything except

1333
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,880
the Free Food Fund for
Hungry Children in New York.

1334
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,320
- [Bernie] But what about
hungry trainer

1335
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,800
and a hungry manager?

1336
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,320
- Listen,

1337
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,280
I've been waiting for five years

1338
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,480
for the chance to
nail Uncle Nono

1339
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:25,640
and this is the only way
I could make it work.

1340
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,560
Give the entire gate to charity.

1341
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,720
He had to agree to the
match or else he'd be bared

1342
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,800
from ever promoting another
match anywhere in this country.

1343
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,320
- Well when did all this happen?

1344
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,640
- Just a little while ago.

1345
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,480
I figure when things got tough,

1346
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,600
the thought of a million
bucks would keep you going.

1347
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,480
- Well thank you, we finally
make it over the rainbow

1348
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:43,920
to find out that the
pot's empty!

1349
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,000
- Bonnelli, look,

1350
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,600
after this fight,
everything is yours.

1351
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,920
But for now,

1352
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,800
I'm gonna give you a chance
for once in your life

1353
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,320
to do the right thing.

1354
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,480
Help somebody else.

1355
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,960
- What did you ever give away,
Duke?

1356
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,280
A few funny lines to some guy
who got his head handed to him

1357
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,400
in the loosing end of a fight

1358
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,280
so you could sell
some more papers?

1359
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,440
Billy, Mr. Parkhurst,
here, knew all the time

1360
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,960
that I would go along with it.

1361
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,960
He could spot a sucker like me
a mile away, chasing a dream,

1362
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,080
but I ain't talking for
you or Matilda.

1363
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,520
- Well...

1364
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:17,360
Well, it's whatever you say,
Bernie.

1365
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,920
You're the only one that's ever
been nice to Matilda and me.

1366
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,680
- It's gonna be Matilda's
toughest fight.

1367
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,480
But the man's right about
cleaning up the sport

1368
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:29,440
and helping the kids.

1369
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:31,840
- Well it's all right by
Matilda and me

1370
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,280
if you say so, Bernie.

1371
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,040
You'd never do
anything wrong to us.

1372
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:40,960
- Mr. Parkhurst,

1373
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,320
you've got yourself the fight
of the century to write about.

1374

[upbeat music]

1375
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,200
- [Billy Voiceover] We trained
hard from early morning

1376
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,320
till late every day.

1377
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,920
But the champ was
training hard too.

1378
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,560
He was determined Matilda
wouldn't win this fight.

1379
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,720
It was gonna be the fight
of Lee Dockerty's life.

1380
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,720
Tanya felt badly after what
had happened to Dockerty

1381
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,800
at the carnival and she
became Lee's greatest fan.

[Matilda grunting]

1383
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:22,400
- [Pinky] Great, champ!

1384
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,000
You're looking great.

1390
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,520
Everything okay, Harry?

1391
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,720
- Fine, Mr. Bonnelli, all
peace and quiet.

1392
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,720
- Look, I just came in here

1393
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,560
to see if you were all right,
champ.

1394
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,320
You funny beast.

1395
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,160
Matilda.

1396
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,800
Matilda, where are you
coming from, Matilda?

1397
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,440
Who made you?

1398
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,360
And why?

1399
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:21,720
Why?

1400
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,880
Why should you, the most
funny-looking put together

1401
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,080
animal in the world,
have this great talent?

1402
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:32,560
Has the spirit of Dempsey and
Sugar Ray entered your body?

1403
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:36,320
But why you, Matilda?

1404
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:40,680
Other kangaroos are in circuses
and zoos and carnivals,

1405
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,920
but never, no one, no
one like you.

1406
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,760
You're going along with
what started out as a gag

1407
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,320
and now laughing your head off?

1408
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,680
But whatever it is, there's
something I wanna say.

1409
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:57,960
No matter how we make out,

1410
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
you and Billy are winners

1411
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,720
and for the first
time in my life,

1412
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,160
you've made me a winner too.

1413
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,240
Thanks.

Happy to see you.

- Oh, I've been fine,
how are you?

1426
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,120
- Yeah, get in.

1427
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,240
- [Bernie] Ha, ha, ha.

1428
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,320
- Come on, Bern, in the car.

1429
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:14,640
- [Bernie] This is a nice car.

1430
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,480
Are we going for a ride?

1431
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,440
- [Bernardo] Hey, paesano,
relax.

1432
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:21,960
You want a drink?

1433
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,120
- [Macante] Yeah,
turn on the TV.

1434
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,880
[pleasant music]

1435
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:34,080
- Now look, kid, this could be
a short night if you're smart

1436
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,240
or it could be a longer
one if you're not.

1437
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:38,680
Come here.

1438
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:57,280
You, Bonnelli, you've
caused me a lot of grief.

1439
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,080
You've taken apart an
organization

1440
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,760
that's taken me
years to develop.

1441
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,400
My men, they're morons.

1442
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:09,240
So, Uncle Nono has to take
care of business himself.

1443
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,400
This is for you.

1444
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:15,720
I've already signed it.

1445
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,560
You are now the owner
of Lee Dockerty

1446
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,160
after the fight tomorrow night.

1447
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,640
This one, here, you sign.

1448
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,480
And I own Matilda at
the same time.

1449
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,080
You wanna sign?

1450
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:45,560
[snapping]

1451
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,720
[guns clicking]

1452
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,160
- You ain't thinking clear.

1453
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,280
Kill me and Billy makes
Matilda fight anyways.

1454
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,160
You can't win.

1455
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,360
- When we get through with you,

1456
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:54,880
we're going back to that camp

1457
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:58,040
and we whack out of the
Englishman and the kangaroo.

1458
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,200
- Even you couldn't
take the heat

1459
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:00,520
that would come down after that.

1460
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:01,040
Uh-uh.

1461
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:02,320
Uh-uh.

1462
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,760
You didn't get to the top
doing stuff like that.

1463
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,480
Them, maybe, but not you.

1464
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,040
[laughing]

1465
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,600
- You're all right, kid.

1466
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,840
I like you, like your style.

1467
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,680
If you ever decide to get
out of the boxing racket,

1468
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,520
you got a position with
me and my organization.

1469
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:23,800
- Uh-uh.

1470
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,840
- No, no, no, I mean it,
strictly legit.

1471
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:26,720
Straight.

1472
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:30,240
I own 45 different businesses

1473
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,720
between manufacturing and

1474
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:35,720
leisure time activities.

1475
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,560
- Are they your board
of directors?

1476
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,640
- You gotta
understand one thing,

1477
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,160
business is business

1478
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,040
but that does not
include boxing.

1479
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,920
Boxing is my hobby.

1480
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,560
- You're really just a
sportsman at heart.

1481
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:48,680
- Yeah.

1482
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,480
I mean, what's wrong with
wanting to own

1483
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:51,960
a heavyweight champ?

1484
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,040
Tell me.

1485
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,240
Vanderbilt would like to own

1486
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:56,440
a winning horse in the Derby,
right?

1487
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,480
Why not?

1488
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,360
- They work it another way.

1489
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:00,880
- Work?

1490
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:03,960
Come on, they never worked
an honest day in their life.

1491
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,720
They bought the best
their money could buy.

1492
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,600
It's the American way.

1493
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,640
That's what our parents
came here for.

1494
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,480
And don't you forget it.

1495
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:15,320
All right, take Mr.
Bonnelli back.

1496
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,120
No hard feelings, kid.

1497
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:20,800
- No.

1498
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,480
I'll see you.

1499
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:27,080
[somber music]

1500
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:34,840
- Hey, Macante.

1501
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,040
I want you to call Reno
and tell them

1502
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,920
I want to lay a million dollars
on the kangaroo tomorrow.

1503
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:50,800
- Boss,

1504
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:51,920
that's a lot of money.

1505
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,400
- Would you do what I tell you?

1506
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:02,640
[airplane whooshing]

1507
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,040
[exciting music]

1508
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,200
- [Announcer] American
Airlines flight 42

1509
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:14,520
from Mexico City and Acapulco
arriving at gate six.

1510
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:17,120
Flight 19 from Sydney,
Melbourne and Tokyo,

1511
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,320
arriving at gate nine.

1512
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:22,080
[exciting music]

1513
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,440
- Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen!

1514
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:28,840
I'm John Dunphy, your
ringside commentator,

1515
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,320
welcoming you from Paris
Hotel in Reno,

1516
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:33,080
on a cool, crisp evening for

1517
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:36,800
the Lee Dockerty/Matilda fight
for the Heavyweight crown.

1518
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,000
They're all here!

1519
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,360
The wealthy, the near wealthy,

1520
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:42,320
the politicians, the
stage and screen stars

1521
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:43,640
and of course, the sportsmen!

1522
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:46,440
A cross section of the
rich and powerful

1523
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:47,360
from all over the globe.

1524
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:49,840
They've traveled
thousands of miles

1525
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,760
to see this little
square above me,

1526
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,120
where, here in a few moments,

1527
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:56,320
probably the two finest
fighting machine of all time

1528
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:58,120
are going to meet each other.

1529
01:08:58,160 --> 01:08:59,480
But ladies and gentlemen,

1530
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,880
never have the championship
fights been so clouded

1531
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,360
by rumors.

1532
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:06,920
There's a report that both camps
have bought off the judges,

1533
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,520
that Dockerty is terrified

1534
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,440
and plans to take a dive
right after the opening bell.

1535
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,320
There's a report that
somebody's been doping

1536
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:15,000
Matilda's breakfast food!

1537
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,240
And another has it
that Lee Dockerty

1538
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:19,160
has hurt his left
hand in sparing

1539
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:22,960
and is going to take a dive
right after the opening bell.

1540
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,120
- Hey, Duke, how are you?

1541
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,320
Who do you like?

1542
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,320
- I don't guess you
read my column.

1543
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:32,040
Matilda in two.

1544
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,480
- Could be.

1545
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:36,800
I saw the rerun of the last
fight in Chicago on TV.

1546
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,120
- Are you betting?

1547
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:40,120
- No, I don't bet fights.

1548
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:41,080
Congratulations.

1549
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:43,840
- [John] And here
comes the champion

1550
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,880
from the far corner of
the Colosseum.

1551
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,000
Lee Dockerty, the Heavyweight
Champion of the World

1552
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,160
is on his way to the ring!

1553
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,760
And there's a mixed
reaction from the crowd.

1554
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,120
A lot of them were for him.

1555
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,240
- Billy, what's wrong?

1556
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,080
I don't know how to tell you.

1557
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,680
I know I should've
told you before.

1558
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:05,200
- Well come on, nothing
could be that bad.

1559
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,560
We made it to the top,
didn't we?

1560
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:07,440
- Yeah!

1561
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:10,760
- Bernie,

1562
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,960
if a kangaroo is hit,
he won't fight anymore.

1563
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:21,320
- You told me they box
natural in their wild state,

1564
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:24,520
that he was merely using what
they did natural for the act.

1565
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,240
- That's right, they do.

1566
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:30,680
But it's not boxing
as we know it.

1567
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,360
When kangaroos box,

1568
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,440
they don't do it to
hurt each other.

1569
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,680
The one that gets the
first wallop wins.

1570
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,560
The other one stops right
there and then

1571
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,280
and he'll never fight again.

1572
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,640
- Matilda flattened the champ,
didn't he?

1573
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:48,120
- Dockerty had had a
few drinks that night.

1574
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:51,040
Matilda nailed him,
you know that.

1575
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,720
Cyclone and Cowboy Jones?

1576
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,320
- I knew they were washed up.

1577
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,320
We were all lucky.

1578
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,280
Dockerty is not drunk tonight.

1579
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,240
And unless Matilda
gets him first,

1580
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:12,840
Dockerty's gonna take him apart.

1581
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:14,840
[crowd booing]

1582
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:18,000
- I've never seen Lee Dockerty
in such wonderful condition.

1583
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,520
He's taking this
fight seriously.

1584
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,200
Mentally and physically.

1585
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:24,160
He's ready for the
fight of his life!

1586
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,960
And he better be!

1587
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,680
[crowd cheering]

1588
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,880
And here comes the challenger!

1589
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,160
The challenger is greeted by

1590
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,280
a tremendous voice
from the crowd!

1591
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,600
Matilda!

1592
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:37,280
The challenger for the
Heavyweight crown

1593
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,000
is on his way into the ring!

1594
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,760
This is the most unusual

1595
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,360
Heavyweight Championship
fight in history!

1596
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,800
Man against beast!

1597
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,400
Who is going to win?

1598
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:50,360
[exciting marching band music]

1599
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:57,400
But nevertheless, the fact is

1600
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:00,440
that the odds are six to
five on winning

1601
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,320
and three to one on a knockout.

1602
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,040
And that's what it's all about

1603
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,840
as we approach the
moment of truth.

1604
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:08,800

- I love that animal.

1616
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:47,000
The perfect fighting machine.

01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,600

[crowd booing]

1623
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:04,040
Dockerty!

1624
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:06,520
[bell ringing]

1625
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,880
The referee, George Latke.

1626
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:11,320
[applauding]

1627
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,680
- Now let me take a look
at your gloves.

1628
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:16,560
Keep your punches up
at all times.

1629
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,040
Now I don't want any
kidney punches

1630
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,280
and I don't want any rapid
punches, is that clear?

1631
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,680
Now, does he
understand all this?

1632
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:23,200
- Oh, yes, yes.

1633
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:25,920
He's been train according to
the mark of the Queen's boxers.

1634
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,480
Just tap him on the shoulder,
he'll break.

1635
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:28,680
He's got ring manners.

1636
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:29,920
- He really does understand?

1637
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:30,600
- Yes, sir.

1638
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:31,640
- All right, okay.

1639
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:32,840
Shake hands now, come
out fighting.

1640
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,040
[crowd cheering]

1641
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,560
- [John] Waiting now
for the greatest moment

1642
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,720
in Heavyweight
Championship history,

1643
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,080
Matilda the fighting,
boxing kangaroo.

1644
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:44,320
Lee Dockerty is the Heavyweight
Champion of the World.

1645
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:46,480
Here's Matilda, ready
to come out to battle.

1646
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:48,560
Our battle instructions
for the champion.

1647
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:51,440
[crowd cheering]

1648
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:52,960
Ready for the bell
for round one.

1649
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:53,760
[bell ringing]

1650
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,200
There's the bell!

1651
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:56,320
[crowd cheering]

1652
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:57,920
Matilda bounds out there.

1653
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:59,440
The champion waits for him,
sticks out his left hand,

1654
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:00,120
it's short!

1655
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,440
Another one is short!

1656
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:04,280
Apparently, Matilda's a fine
boxer and a good hitter.

1657
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:05,600
The champion misses
over the head,

1658
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,240
takes a right to the
jaw and back.

1659
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,920
Both hands to the
body by Matilda.

1660
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:11,000
Matilda fakes the left hand.

1661
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,760
Drives another left,
it's wide over the mark.

1662
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,040
The champion is short.

1663
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,640
He's not landed a punch yet.

1664
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:17,840
The champion tries another
left hand and misses.

1665
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:18,960
And he ducks away.

1666
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,600
Misses a left hand
over the head,

1667
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:23,080
is driven back by a right
to the jaw by Matilda.

1668
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,760
The challenger is in
control of the fight

1669
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:25,840
here in round one.

1670
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:26,640
[crowd booing]

1671
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:27,400
- Get off his feet!

1672
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:28,720
Break!

1673
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:30,840
- [John] The referee, George
Latke, gets them apart.

1674
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,040
At long range again.

1675
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,200
Matilda bounds in, the
champion steps away,

1676
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:36,160
almost trips over
Matilda's feet.

1677
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:37,320
But he does not go down!

1678
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,600
A left in the head by
the champion,

1679
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:41,400
he takes a counter in right
in the left of the jaw,

1680
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,720
thrown by Matilda!

1681
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:45,640
The champion is
strong on the left.

1682
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:49,240
[crowd cheering]

1683
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:54,400
The champion may be out,
I don't know.

1684
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,280
The referee is counting numbers.

1685
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,520
He has two outs and he's
trying to get up now

1686
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,600
as the crowd reaches six,

1687
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:01,280
seven,

1688
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:02,120
eight.

1689
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,360
He is up at the count of eight

1690
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:04,640
and the referee wipes
off his gloves.

1691
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,320
- You can do it, come on, champ!

1692
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:07,800
- [John] In real trouble!

1693
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,920
This is amazing tonight, folks!

1694
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:11,080
The challenger bounds in.

1695
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:12,520
Matilda comes at him.

1696
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,160
The champion is
stalling for time.

1697
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,680
He's combing around the ring.

1698
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,040
And he comes back with a left.

1699
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:19,480
[crowd cheering]

1700
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,320
- One.

1701
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:21,320
Two.

1702
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,120
Three.

1703
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:22,960
[bell ringing]

1704
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:23,920
- [John] And that's the bell!

1705
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:25,320
- God, that second punch!

1706
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,760
Dockerty doesn't even
know where he is.

1707
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,280
It might be over.

1708
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,600
- [John] The bell has
saved the champion.

1709
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:33,280
[Matilda whimpering]

1710
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,000
A beaten champion gets
back to his corner.

1711
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:38,720
His helpers are worried
and working over it.

1712
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:39,760
- Keep it with you.

1713
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:42,520
Stay away from him,
even to box him!

1714
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:43,400
- You're doing fine.

1715
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,640
They're gonna keep it going.

1716
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:46,320
- Remember that!

1717
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:47,400
Box him!

1718
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,200
- [John] The fighting kangaroo,
Matilda!

1719
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,960
[crowd cheering]

1720
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,400
They're a very happy
group in Matilda's corner.

1721
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:55,120
[bell ringing]

1722
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:56,080
We're ready now.

1723
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:57,960
Dockerty comes out
for round two.

1724
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,040
[crowd cheering]

1725
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,840
The champion bicycles
a little bit.

1726
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:03,840
Moves away from the challenger.

1727
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:05,720
The challenger just
stands there.

1728
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,440
Watch the punch,
watch another one.

1729
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,720
[crowd cheering]

1730
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:13,760
Matilda blocks another left
hand, thrown by the champion.

1731
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:14,880
He still hasn't landed.

1732
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,880
Matilda in with a left
hand to the body.

1733
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,240
- Come on, champ!

1734
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,480
- [John] He's wild with
his left hand!

1735
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:24,760
Matilda is a fine
defensive boxer.

1736
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,280
He drives a left and
right to the jaw.

1737
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:27,920
[crowd cheering]

1738
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,680
Again, the champion is
driven under the ropes.

1739
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:33,160
He bounds off and Matilda
throws him down to the canvas.

1740
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,400
And he referee has him get up,

1741
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:35,800
this time without a count.

1742
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:38,160
The champion trips over
Matilda's feet.

1743
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,720
Matilda on him again.

1744
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,680
A jab, a left and a
right to the jaw!

1745
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,560
And the champion is
driven out of the ring.

1746
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,080
He rose up off the ring!

1747
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,200
The champion out of the ring!

1748
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:48,320
They're very happy in
Matilda's corner.

1749
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:50,720
Matilda waiting for the
champ to get back in.

1750
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:52,600
The champion is trying
to get back in.

1751
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,080
He does beat the count.

1752
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:55,320
[bell ringing]

1753
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,600
And there's the bell.

1754
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,720
[crowd applauding]

1755
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:01,200
[Matilda cooing]

1756
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:02,640
The kangaroo back in his corner

1757
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:04,440
and there's the champion,
Lee Dockery.

1758
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:05,720
- You're doing great,
they love you.

1759
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:06,840
- Let me talk to him!

1760
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,160
All right, take it easy.

1761
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,120
- Well, Dockerty's
accomplished one thing.

1762
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:10,920
- What?

1763
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,000
- He made it to round three.

1764
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,320
No other opponent's
ever done that.

1765
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,320
- [John] The first round
took so much out of him.

1766
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,880
The referee goes over
and asks him how he is.

1767
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:20,040
He is not in good shape
but he is game

1768
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:22,480
and he is going to
keep on fighting.

1769
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:23,480
[bell ringing]

1770
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,200
And there's the bell
for round three!

1771
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:27,320
The kangaroo is across
the ring so fast!

1772
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:29,040
Dockerty isn't even out
of his corner!

1773
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,680
He's caught by a
right to the jaw!

1774
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:32,720
And the referee is
counting over him again.

1775
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:35,000
Dockerty on one knee is
taking the count.

1776
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:37,560
He's back on his feet and
ready to fight.

1777
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:38,600
And Matilda comes at him.

1778
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,480
Dockerty misses a
left and a right.

1779
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,920
He's trying hard but he's
not landing any punches.

1780
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:44,760
He takes another
right to the jaw.

1781
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,720
[crowd cheering]

1782
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,640
He almost goes out of
the ring but he does not.

1783
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:49,840
The ropes hold him up.

1784
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:52,320
He grabs hold of Matilda
to keep from going down.

1785
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:54,360
Dockerty is wobbly in there.

1786
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,400
He's on very rubbery feet.

1787
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,720
He moves to the left and
Matilda comes up behind him

1788
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:00,080
and drives the right
hand to the head!

1789
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:02,200
Matilda moves away from
Dockerty again.

1790
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:04,400
Dockerty is reeling
around the ring.

1791
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,680
He is in bad shape!

1792
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:07,280
If he were not a
Heavyweight Champion,

1793
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,040
it probably would stop him!

1794
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:12,320
Matilda is on him again,
reigning punches to the body!

1795
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:13,440
And then to the head.

1796
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:14,840
This kangaroo can fight!

1797
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:15,720
He messes him up good.

1798
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:16,800
A good jab!

1799
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:18,080
Two more, three more
jabs to the chest!

1800
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:19,320
[booing]

1801
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,280
Wobbly Dockerty fires
a meaningless left hand

1802
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:22,920
and he goes down again.

1803
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,080
But he bounds up quickly

1804
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:27,240
and the referee goes
around them.

1805
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,200
- What is keeping him up?

1806
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:29,280
- [John] Dockerty misses a left.

1807
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:31,040
Counter to the left,
right to the head.

1808
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:33,040
A left hand to the
body by Matilda!

1809
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:35,520
Dockerty is taking an
awful beating in there!

1810
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:36,920
He still has not landed a punch

1811
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,600
and we're near the end
of round three!

1812
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:41,120
Dockerty is battered, puts
both hands to the body

1813
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:45,520
and none to the head as
Matilda give him no rest.

1814
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:47,360
The champion is taking a
terrible beating.

1815
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,520
A left hook to the jaw!

1816
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:49,360
[thudding]

1817
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:50,640
[crowd cheering]

1818
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:52,080
Dockerty is down again!

1819
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:53,600
I don't know if he's
going to make it.

1820
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:55,440
Matilda bounds across him!

1821
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,880
The referee is counting
over the champion.

1822
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:58,760
- Four!

1823
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,320
Five!

1824
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:02,800
Six!

1825
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,080
- [John] Seven.

1826
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:06,200
He's trying to get up, eight!

1827
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:07,040
Nine.
[bell ringing]

1828
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:10,080
And the bell saves him again.

1829
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,320
Dockerty's back in his corner.

1830
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,240
He has taken some
beating tonight.

1831
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:15,600
There's the doctor!

1832
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:16,640
- It's all over.

1833
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,320
He can't come out
from the fourth.

1834
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,000
I'm almost sorry.

1835
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,560
- [John] Dockerty
won't let them!

1836
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:23,840
He wants to go on!

1837
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:25,400
He has fought courageously!

1838
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:26,480
He still wants to fight.

1839
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:28,160
- How are you, champ?

1840
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:29,640
- [John] Lee Dockerty,

1841
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:33,320
and believe it or not, something
definite has happened here.

1842
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:34,400
I don't believe it.

1843
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:35,880
The crowd started
rooting for Matilda

1844
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:37,200
at the start of the fight.

1845
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:38,720
They have now changed.

1846
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:41,240
[crowd applauding]

1847
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,760
[bell ringing]

1848
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,960
- [John] There's the bell for
round four of the most amazing

1849
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,400
Heavyweight Championship
fight in all history!

1850
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:49,480
And the crowd is now for the
champion, believe it or not.

1851
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,360
But he is still taking
punishment in there.

1852
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,800
Punches all over to the body,
to the head.

1853
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,120
Matilda bangs and
staggers him again.

1854
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:59,080
I don't even know what's
hold the champion up.

1855
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,680
He is reeling around the ring.

1856
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:01,920
I don't think he
knows where he is.

1857
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:05,000
The crowd is now with him
because of game.

1858
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,760
He is a gallant
fighter in there.

1859
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,240
He just will not quit.

1860
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,360
He is a true champion,
win or lose, tonight!

1861
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,120
But he takes two, three,
four more jabs to the chin

1862
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:15,240
and still he has not
landed a punch.

1863
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,440
A pounding right to the
jaw by Matilda.

1864
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:18,840
He is staggered back
into the ropes.

1865
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,080
The champion is wobbly in there.

1866
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:22,200
His legs are rubbery!

1867
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:24,000
Matilda can't figure him out.

1868
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:25,800
The champion goes in
and holds on.

1869
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,760
Dockerty is still holding on.

1870
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,080
The challenger is lifted!

- Matilda's been hit!

1874
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:35,760
- [John] And the
challenger is hurt!

1875
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:38,040
That's the first time
he's been hit tonight.

1876
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,480
The tide is turned.

1877
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,080
The challenger is hurt!

Nobody seems to know
what is happening.

1882
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,200
This is amazing!

1883
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:52,160
- The referee waves
the champion in.

1884
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:53,800
He's moving in on Matilda.

1885
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:55,520
But wait!

The fight is over.

1889
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:03,360
Lee Dockerty is still
the heavyweight champion!

1890
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,040

and then they want him to lose.

1899
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:26,040
- [Duke] Well, sure, they
loved Matilda up to a point.

1900
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,960
Then they saw themselves in
that ring, the human race.

1901
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,480
Suddenly they felt threatened.

1902
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,480
Man doesn't just survive, Al,

1903
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,200
