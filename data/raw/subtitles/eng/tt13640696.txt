1
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,815
{\an8}<i>Agatha Christie's</i> The Mousetrap.

2
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:09,570
{\an8}<i>In my opinion, a
second-rate murder mystery.</i>

3
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,532
{\an8}<i>Not that I've seen
it, you understand.</i>

4
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,367
<i>But it's a whodunit.</i>

5
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:17,578
<i>You've seen one,
you've seen 'em all.</i>

6
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,582
<i>You know the drill.</i>

7
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:26,044
<i>An interminable prologue in which
all the key players are introduced.</i>

8
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,130
<i>You get a sense of the
world they inhabit...</i>

9
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:32,509
<i>and then the most unlikable
character gets bumped off.</i>

10
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,261
There's been a murder?

11
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:37,139
<i>Cue the entrance of a
world-weary detective...</i>

12
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,726
<i>who comes in and
pokes his nose around.</i>

13
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:45,147
<i>Talks to witnesses. Takes
a couple of wrong turns.</i>

14
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,650
<i>And then gathers all the
suspects in the drawing room...</i>

15
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:53,363
<i>and points the finger at the least likely
chump because of the way the guy...</i>

16
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,990
<i>I don't know...</i>

17
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:56,783
<i>ties his shoelaces.</i>

18
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,996
Now you've seen our play,
you're an accomplice to murder.

19
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:04,750
And so, we ask
you to remember...

20
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,628
that it is very much
in your interests...

21
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,923
not to tell a soul
outside of this theater...

22
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,633
who done it.

23
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,511
<i>But what do I know?</i>

24
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,763
<i>The Limeys, they just lap it up.</i>

25
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,893
<i>The play's a smash hit.
Not to mention a cash cow.</i>

26
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,439
<i>Right there is the milkmaid
in chief, Petula Spencer.</i>

27
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:50,838
<i>This lavish affair is a party to
celebrate the 100th performance.</i>

28
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:56,176
<i>No wonder film producer John Woolf wants to
turn the play into a major motion picture.</i>

29
00:02:56,343 --> 00:03:00,347
<i>Here he is now in the arms of
his slightly paranoid wife.</i>

30
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:03,475
I sense that death
is close at hand.

31
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:04,935
It's probably just a draft.

32
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,604
<i>This is where I come in.</i>

33
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,398
<i>Leo Kopernick's the name.</i>

34
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,442
<i>Big-shot Hollywood director.</i>

35
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:17,030
<i>Hired to make the film adaptation
marginally less boring than the play.</i>

36
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:22,578
<i>Easier said than done when the
writer's a giant pompous ass.</i>

37
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,122
<i>Mervyn Cocker-Norris.</i>

38
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,082
I say, you're rather tall.

39
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,501
Am I? Haven't really thought
about it, to be honest.

40
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:30,961
Is that what happened here?

41
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,922
Sort of. I had a bit of
an accident backstage.

42
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:37,885
<i>Sure, he's educated and he
knows a lot of $10 words...</i>

43
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,013
<i>but it's like he's never
seen a film before...</i>

44
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,598
<i>let alone try to write one.</i>

45
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:49,396
No one important.

46
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:55,485
You know, at times you do rather
overdo the temperamental Neapolitan.

47
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:57,946
That's a nice jacket.

48
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,911
Say, why don't you scare me up
a real drink, will you, kid?

49
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,539
Like a pint of rye or bourbon...

50
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:10,375
or motor oil, if you have to.

51
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,336
Yeah. Hop to it, now.

52
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:15,547
<i>In England, that actually
counts as good service.</i>

53
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,548
<i>I was stationed here
during the war...</i>

54
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,636
<i>and, if anything, the locals
are more uptight now...</i>

55
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,096
<i>than when they had the
Luftwaffe overhead.</i>

56
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,431
Mervyn?

57
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,933
Shouldn't you be home? I
thought we had a deadline.

58
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,645
I thought so too.

59
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,231
But then our esteemed director
tore up the screenplay...

60
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,650
and told me to start
all over again.

61
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,653
He's of the opinion that a modern
audience will walk out in protest...

62
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,863
if they're not served at
least one violent death...

63
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,573
in the opening frames.

64
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,743
Suffice to say, we are no
longer on speaking terms.

65
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,495
Merv!

66
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,373
London's most sensitive writer.

67
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,417
How is <i>The Mousetrap,</i> huh?

68
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:53,986
Did they catch the
guy who did it?

69
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,296
I will not stand
here and be insulted.

70
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:00,542
Well, I guess he's gonna go
over there and be insulted.

71
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,013
<i>What passes for
glamour in these parts.</i>

72
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,100
<i>Sheila Sim and
Dickie Attenborough.</i>

73
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:11,311
<i>Kid likes the sound
of his own voice.</i>

74
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,397
<i>Even money, he makes a speech.</i>

75
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:15,524
I suppose I ought
to say a few words.

76
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:16,692
Not too many.

77
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:19,361
- When have I ever?
- Our wedding, remember?

78
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,088
- We almost missed the honeymoon.
- Yes.

79
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,866
Darlings, you're ever so kind.

80
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:27,870
I'd like to ask you all to
raise a metaphorical bat...

81
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,580
to the old pavilion.

82
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,499
<i>The Mousetrap</i> is 100, not out.

83
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,917
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

84
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,838
<i>I tell you what
else is 100 not out.</i>

85
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:40,007
<i>Petula's mother.</i>

86
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:43,427
<i>The old kook's just
crazy about seafood.</i>

87
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:45,679
They just brought out
more langoustines.

88
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,726
Excuse me, I just need
to deal with that.

89
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,645
- Mother! Please, you've had quite enough.
- Hi.

90
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,482
<i>Now, I'm not one to tell
tales out of school...</i>

91
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:01,153
<i>but the girls over here, they go
wild for an American accent...</i>

92
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,323
<i>and the promise of
a pair of nylons.</i>

93
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,490
<i>But the husbands...</i>

94
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:08,118
Right. I think it's time
someone taught you a lesson.

95
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:09,912
<i>They're not so easily won over.</i>

96
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,915
It's only fair to warn you that
I learned to box in the RAF.

97
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:16,126
Yeah? Well, I learned to fly
a plane in Gleason's Gym.

98
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,258
<i>All of which explains...</i>

99
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,719
<i>in an admittedly
roundabout fashion...</i>

100
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:31,266
<i>how I come to be in the theater's backstage
area in need of a change of clothes.</i>

101
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,113
Hello?

102
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,605
Hello?

103
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:18,457
Aw, jeez.

104
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,587
<i>I guess I should have
seen this coming.</i>

105
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:26,715
<i>It's always the most unlikable
character who gets bumped off.</i>

106
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,178
<i>It's a whodunit.</i>

107
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:34,014
<i>You've seen one,
you've seen 'em all.</i>

108
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,135
We're closed.

109
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,139
Clear off.

110
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,561
Honestly.

111
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:27,317
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.
Inspector Stoppard, sir.

112
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:29,987
Sorry, I was under strict
instructions not to let anyone in.

113
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,154
Just open the door.

114
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,424
Yes, sir. Of course. Sorry,
I didn't recognize you, sir.

115
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,576
I've actually just been
transferred myself.

116
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,902
Thought it was Leeke and
Priestley on rotation tonight.

117
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,372
Careful, sir.

118
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:41,832
In you come.

119
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,716
- Constable.
- Stalker, sir.

120
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:53,844
God, you're all
wet through, sir.

121
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:55,846
Hope you don't catch
a cold after that.

122
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,139
Yep, after you, sir.

123
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:03,770
Victim's name is Leo Kopernick,
sir. The film director.

124
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,231
Suspected Communist,
blacklisted in Hollywood...

125
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,775
so he came out here to work
on a picture for John Woolf.

126
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:11,695
You know John Woolf,
the film producer.

127
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:14,072
He made <i>The African Queen</i>
with Humphrey Bogart.

128
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:18,118
"Nature, Mr. Allnut, is what we are
put in this world to rise above."

129
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:20,954
That didn't sound
anything like Bogart.

130
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,666
No, that was Katharine Hepburn, sir.
She's in it too. Wonderful actress.

131
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,127
I go to the pictures
quite a lot, actually.

132
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:28,504
It's the escape, I suppose.

133
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,982
- The romance of the silver screen.
- Yes, thank you, Constable.

134
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:32,132
Yes, sir.

135
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:57,449
Signs of a struggle.

136
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:01,328
Actually, sir, I believe that
happened when Mrs. Boyle was killed.

137
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:02,913
Mrs. Boyle? Who's...

138
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,416
Yes, sir. She's that woman
in the front row there.

139
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,046
Well, she seems to
have bounced back.

140
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:16,385
Sorry, sir. No, she was killed
in the play. Also strangled.

141
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:18,432
Not that I've seen it,
although I would like to.

142
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:21,723
It's an Agatha Christie,
and I do like a good murder.

143
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,809
Yes, thank you, Constable.

144
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:24,976
Yes, sir.

145
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,737
A ski did that, sir.

146
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:38,198
They use it in the
play, apparently.

147
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:39,867
As I said, I haven't seen it.

148
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:44,121
And then the large dent in the
cranium is a sewing machine.

149
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,623
Seems he was killed in the
costume store initially...

150
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,458
and then he was deposited here.

151
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,379
Staged, so to speak.

152
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:55,716
Sorry, sir.

153
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,351
Yeah, that's the ski that
he took in the face, sir.

154
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:09,021
And I'm afraid it was
downhill from there.

155
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:13,734
Sorry, sir. That one
just came out on its own.

156
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,994
Seems he came down here
for a change of clothes.

157
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,414
Why?

158
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,715
It was a party to celebrate
the 100th performance, sir.

159
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:40,844
The other nought must have...
When the victim upset the sponge.

160
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,557
And he then proceeded to sit in
the assortment of crustaceans.

161
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:54,733
I'm told he was
intoxicated, sir, as a newt.

162
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:58,820
This was actually a lot more
fun than I thought it would be.

163
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:08,121
Then he left. No one saw him again
until the body was discovered.

164
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,331
That's correct, sir.

165
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,085
Perhaps they were all
in on it together, sir?

166
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:32,980
Looks like the killer tried to
pull out the victim's tongue.

167
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,315
Why would anyone do
a thing like that?

168
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:38,569
Excuse me, Chief Inspector.

169
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:39,694
It's just "Inspector."

170
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,822
Yes. Of course. Inspector.

171
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,324
I hate to interrupt, I do.
There really is nothing worse...

172
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:47,578
Petula Spencer, sir.
Prominent theater impresario.

173
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:48,787
Yes, thank you, Constable.

174
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:52,958
Tell me, how much longer do you
intend to keep us all hostage here?

175
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:56,003
Or is that the idea? "Let
the galled jade wince."

176
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:58,602
Gather all the suspects
under one roof...

177
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,352
and then interrogate each of us in
turn until the mystery is solved?

178
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:03,343
Mervyn Cocker-Norris,
overrated playwright.

179
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,095
Celebrated playwright.

180
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:08,932
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir. I
can't read me own handwriting.

181
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,310
Not that we are
suspects, necessarily.

182
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:14,938
Are we suspects?

183
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:20,611
It was just a reference to Agatha Christie
and her penchant for denouement...

184
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,863
in which the detective
gathers the...

185
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:25,365
I dare say, that's not...

186
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:28,368
- Please continue.
- Yes, thank you, Mervyn.

187
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:33,207
Inspector, I want you to know that I
have nothing but the utmost respect...

188
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,917
for the Metropolitan Police.

189
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:37,544
But, well, do you think you
might be finished in time...

190
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,992
- for curtain up tomorrow night?
- Oh, for goodness' sake.

191
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,090
John Woolf, esteemed
film producer.

192
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:43,467
Yes, thank you, Constable.

193
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:47,554
This is a murder investigation.
Surely that takes precedence...

194
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:48,972
sold out or not.

195
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,284
Yes, it's all going to plan
for you, isn't it, Woolfie?

196
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:52,601
You want the run to end.

197
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,728
I want nothing of the sort.

198
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:59,274
It's the decent thing to do, that's all.
Close the theater out of respect for Leo.

199
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:00,651
Such a tragic loss.

200
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:04,988
Inspector, I implore
you not to overreact.

201
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:08,450
I would hate to have to
go over your head and...

202
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,620
talk directly to your superiors.

203
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,590
We wouldn't want that,
now would we, madam?

204
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:16,625
But I'm afraid that under the
circumstances, as a precaution...

205
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:17,793
Precaution?

206
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:19,920
He's already dead.

207
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,338
He is, madam.

208
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:24,132
But until we have an idea
as to a likely motive...

209
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,260
who's to say this
is the end of it?

210
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,886
What is that supposed to mean?

211
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,556
We are no longer
merely suspects.

212
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,976
We are also potential victims.

213
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:41,567
Oh, God, I wasn't in that,
was I? I must look dreadful.

214
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:08,217
Excuse me, sir.

215
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:19,062
Stoppard!

216
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:20,606
My office.

217
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:23,233
Hello, sir.

218
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,445
What in God's name possessed you
to close down the Ambassadors?

219
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:27,988
Protocol, sir.
It's a crime scene.

220
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:31,450
No, it's a public relations
disaster, is what it is.

221
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:32,617
Public what, sir?

222
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:33,785
- Stalker!
- Sir.

223
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:35,913
Not to put too
fine a point on...

224
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,122
- Yes, please.
- Here.

225
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:39,046
Not to put too fine a
point on it, Inspector...

226
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:42,169
but your latest blunder
is front page news.

227
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:45,380
{\an8}Fleet Street is all over this,
like hot jam on a Devonshire scone.

228
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:48,717
You are slap-bang
in the crosshairs.

229
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:50,986
{\an8}Now, we need to do
everything we can...

230
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:53,722
{\an8}to make sure the bullet
doesn't miss you and hit me.

231
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:55,682
- Yeah, of course, sir. Yes.
- Good.

232
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:57,559
Then you'll inform
the theater at once.

233
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,311
Well, I thought as
a precaution, I...

234
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,690
The Home Secretary is a close,
personal friend of Agatha Christie.

235
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,983
His brother-in-law
is Rex Harrison.

236
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,587
- Wonderful actor.
- Yes, thank you, Constable.

237
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:08,444
Sir.

238
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:11,409
It's actually worked in our favor to
have the press distracted like this.

239
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:14,910
It means we can keep a lid on
the Rillington Place murders.

240
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,996
Rillington Place murders.
Yes. What's that?

241
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,957
Blimey.

242
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:23,669
Haven't you heard? We have a
serial killer on the loose.

243
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:26,171
You didn't think all of this
was for you, now, did you?

244
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,424
- No, of course...
- No.

245
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:31,551
Of course not.

246
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:35,347
Well, have all the resources been
allocated to this other investigation?

247
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:37,140
No, not all of them, no.

248
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,894
I understand you met
WPC Stalker last night?

249
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:42,187
I did, yes.

250
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:44,064
- Constable.
- Inspector.

251
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:46,859
A very capable officer.

252
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,612
Or at least she will be once
she gets the proper instruction.

253
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:54,157
Sorry, sir, I'm not sure I...
You don't mean you want me to...

254
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:55,158
Yes, I do.

255
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:56,952
I'd like you to
show her the ropes.

256
00:17:57,327 --> 00:18:00,127
I'm hoping some of her enthusiasm
for police work might rub off on you.

257
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:03,083
But the bullet,
sir. Is that why...

258
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,502
This is not a debate, Stoppard.

259
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:10,632
I have a reputation as a modernizer.
I have to be seen to keep it up.

260
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,385
I have said in public...

261
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:16,638
that I think women are
the future of the force.

262
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,183
Absolutely, sir, I agree.

263
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,144
- But we're not looking for stolen sweets...
- Sweets.

264
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:23,896
Or a lost bleeding bicycle.

265
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:25,206
This is a murder
investigation...

266
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,690
and she is inexperienced.

267
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:30,152
They were inexperienced
in the war.

268
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,779
Ask Jerry how that turned out.

269
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,198
Yes, sir. But...

270
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:38,702
- That will be all.
- Thank you.

271
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:40,746
- Commissioner.
- Inspector.

272
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:42,915
Constable.

273
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,333
Inspector.

274
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,919
- Commissioner.
- Constable.

275
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,421
Sorry again about
last night, sir.

276
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:51,441
- With the rain and everything...
- Water under the bridge, Constable.

277
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:52,508
No harm done.

278
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:00,724
You all right?

279
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:04,853
Yeah. Do we have an
address for the victim?

280
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:09,149
Yep. It is "Laurel
Canyon, Hollywood, USA."

281
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:13,195
Where was he staying
in England, Constable?

282
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:17,991
Right.

283
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:42,975
If I am honest, <i>Monsieur</i> Kopernick,
he was not a very good guest.

284
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,268
In arrears, was he?

285
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:47,437
<i>Non,</i> but he did not
pay for his room.

286
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,231
<i>Monsieur</i> Woolf did.

287
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,569
What part of France
are you from, sir?

288
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,570
Belgium.

289
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:57,197
Ah, right.

290
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:05,914
Oh, my, my.

291
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,835
What a bloody pigsty.

292
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,963
They don't clean the
rooms at the Savoy?

293
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:15,132
<i>Hélas,</i> not this one.

294
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,385
The maids, they refuse.

295
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:23,056
We offer them more money,
but still they say <i>non.</i>

296
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:27,311
There was an incident.

297
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:30,647
Always <i>avec Monsieur</i>
Kopernick...

298
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:32,065
there was an incident.

299
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:54,880
Thank you, Constable.

300
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:56,840
Sorry, sir.

301
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:59,468
Did one of these incidents
ever turn violent?

302
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:02,346
<i>Oui. Une fois.</i>

303
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:05,933
How dare you call
me a bad writer!

304
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:07,577
I didn't say that. I
said it's bad writing.

305
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,937
I did the best I could within
the confines of the genre...

306
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,480
and Woolf loved it!

307
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:14,167
Woolf wouldn't know a good script if
it came up and bit him on the ass.

308
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:16,652
- It's horseshit!
- No, it isn't! Not all of it!

309
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:18,258
All right, what I
read is horseshit!

310
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:21,031
You mean you didn't
even finish it?

311
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:23,968
I read enough, pal, to know that nobody
gets killed in the first 10 pages!

312
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:25,953
You charlatan! Give it back!

313
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,597
- Listen. Listen to me. Listen!
- Give...

314
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:29,581
We need to go in a completely
different direction!

315
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:40,259
I'll kill you for this,
Kopernick, you bastard!

316
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:46,223
That's that then, sir. It's
as good as a confession.

317
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,226
Let's not jump to
conclusions, Constable.

318
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,061
No, sir.

319
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:53,564
The least we can do is
talk to this other party.

320
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,524
Yes, sir. Cocker-Norris, sir.

321
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:01,238
Tell me, do you write everything
down in that little notebook?

322
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:03,866
Only if it's important, sir.

323
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,659
How do you know
if it's important?

324
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:11,006
Well, I'll just sort
of put everything in...

325
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:15,002
as we go, and then down the line
when we know what's important...

326
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:17,045
we'll know that it's
already in the notebook.

327
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:21,425
So you do write everything down.

328
00:22:21,592 --> 00:22:22,593
Yeah, everything.

329
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:24,553
That's what I thought.

330
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:40,903
Make yourself comfortable. You're
just in time for elevenses.

331
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:23,820
You must excuse the <i>désordre...</i>

332
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:26,281
it's research for
the film adaptation.

333
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:29,326
Police statements, court
reports, newspaper cuttings.

334
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,371
<i>The Mousetrap</i> is actually
based on a real-life case.

335
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:34,039
Nettle tea?

336
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:37,417
I appreciate you've not yet
had time to come to terms...

337
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:38,978
with the death of
Mr. Kopernick, but...

338
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:40,754
Is it true his tongue
was pulled out?

339
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:43,757
I'm afraid I can't divulge details
of an ongoing investigation.

340
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:45,092
It was disgusting.

341
00:23:48,387 --> 00:23:49,387
What?

342
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:02,818
That's Gio. Nephew of
mine. Very hotheaded.

343
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:05,362
I wonder if it
isn't all the fumes.

344
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:06,738
You know, from the chemicals.

345
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:08,574
He's an amateur taxidermist.

346
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:11,618
He has a fascination
with the macabre.

347
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:14,454
I call it his
Stymphalian Bird series.

348
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:19,710
Macabre in a strictly
"ornithological" sense, that is.

349
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:24,464
You wanted to ask me about Leo?

350
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:26,884
We heard there was an
argument at the Savoy...

351
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,850
and I noticed you had
the other half of this.

352
00:24:34,725 --> 00:24:37,561
Inspector, that was a
<i>contretemps,</i> nothing more.

353
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:40,022
Read that part. Yeah.

354
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,567
"I'll kill you for this,
Kopernick, you bastard."

355
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:48,071
Well, obviously, I...

356
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:49,740
Taken out of context, I...

357
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:54,036
Those words were spoken in anger
and under extreme provocation.

358
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:57,247
We had creative
differences, that's all.

359
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:01,210
How did you like <i>The Mousetrap?</i>

360
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:03,587
Oh, yeah, the play?

361
00:25:03,754 --> 00:25:05,672
Yeah, I didn't see it yet.

362
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,984
- Well, if you'd like, I can précis this...
- No, no, no.

363
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:10,511
I got the basics. It's
a whodunit, right?

364
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:14,306
So, you got a dead
body, a detective...

365
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:17,309
and then all the suspects
rather conveniently...

366
00:25:17,476 --> 00:25:19,561
end up in a remote
country house together.

367
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:21,146
In a nutshell.

368
00:25:21,313 --> 00:25:24,566
Our task will be to present this
improbable series of events...

369
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:26,413
to an audience of
moderate intelligence...

370
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:28,946
in a manner that does not
cause too much offense.

371
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:30,447
Easy.

372
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:31,823
Flashbacks.

373
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:33,742
No.

374
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:35,452
No what?

375
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:36,912
No flashbacks.

376
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:40,582
They are crass, lazy, and they
interrupt the flow of the story.

377
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:44,294
In my opinion, they are the last
refuge of a moribund imagination.

378
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:48,215
Whatever next? A caption that
says, "Three weeks later"?

379
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:54,263
Merv. Merv, will you come on?

380
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:55,824
This is crazy. Will
you open the door?

381
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:57,558
I'm not coming out
until Woolf gets here.

382
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,228
What is it this time?

383
00:26:01,395 --> 00:26:02,521
I'll tell you what it is.

384
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:04,064
I pitched a new ending...

385
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:06,942
Cockamamie-Novice over here
locks himself in the bathroom.

386
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:08,735
Is this instead
of the car chase?

387
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:13,490
As well as. I think he thinks
"denouement" is French for "shootout."

388
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:17,160
Will you at least hear me out first,
and then tell me you don't like it?

389
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:21,456
Come on, I storyboarded it
for you. Come on, have a seat.

390
00:26:21,957 --> 00:26:24,960
Why can't we just have the detective
gather everyone in the drawing room...

391
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:27,462
and then reveal to
them who did it?

392
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:30,507
Why? 'Cause it's
old, it's tired.

393
00:26:30,716 --> 00:26:31,996
It's been done a thousand times.

394
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:35,345
So then who explains to the
audience what on Earth's going on?

395
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:36,346
No one.

396
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:37,931
I don't know. The killer.

397
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:40,033
Now you see what I
have to put up with?

398
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:41,393
Will you please have a seat?

399
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:44,563
So, a remote country house.

400
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:48,025
We got all the suspects gathered
in the drawing room, right?

401
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,110
So far, soporific.

402
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:53,030
Suddenly, the lights go out.

403
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:58,035
Our hero grips his Colt
Special, edges into the hall.

404
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:01,997
The killer's got a hostage,
can't get a clear shot.

405
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:04,333
Suddenly, kaboom!

406
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:06,126
The place goes up in flames.

407
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:08,295
Blam! Blam!

408
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:09,922
Our hero plugs the killer.

409
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:11,256
One in the gut!

410
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:12,424
One in the knee!

411
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:14,301
{\an8}Then, all of a sudden...

412
00:27:16,512 --> 00:27:17,930
{\an8}His goddamned gun jams.

413
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:19,473
He's a sittin' duck.

414
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:22,309
Sorry, not that one.

415
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,478
I'm sorry about this.

416
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:26,563
He's a sittin' duck.

417
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:30,484
Our killer, dying
but not dead...

418
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:32,611
takes aim.

419
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,905
Boom! He fires.

420
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,240
Out of nowhere...

421
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:39,326
our hero cop's partner
dives in slow motion!

422
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:40,577
Takes a bullet!

423
00:27:42,621 --> 00:27:48,293
Our hero cradles his partner
like a father would his child.

424
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:51,296
His face a gumbo of emotions.

425
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,384
We hold on the inferno...

426
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:59,596
and we pan left,
to a dead butler.

427
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,851
Hank Williams plays us out.

428
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:06,019
"I Saw The Light."

429
00:28:13,986 --> 00:28:14,820
You hate it.

430
00:28:14,987 --> 00:28:16,405
No, no, I don't hate it.

431
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:17,613
But you don't love it.

432
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:18,699
Of course he doesn't!

433
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:20,075
It's preposterous...

434
00:28:20,242 --> 00:28:22,322
and totally out of keeping
with the rest of the film.

435
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:23,620
Oh, who cares?

436
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:25,807
The audience only ever
remembers the last 20 minutes.

437
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:27,124
Oh, poppycock.

438
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:28,709
Hitchcock, actually.

439
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:30,377
How does he get the gun?

440
00:28:30,836 --> 00:28:31,837
He's a cop!

441
00:28:32,004 --> 00:28:33,881
Police are not armed in England.

442
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:36,383
What? How do they
kill the bad guys?

443
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:40,679
They don't. They ask them to
stop in the name of the law.

444
00:28:42,306 --> 00:28:45,642
Well, he fought in the war, so
he kept his service revolver.

445
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:48,937
God damn it, we're gonna have
to pick this up another time.

446
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:52,482
Say, Merv.

447
00:28:53,317 --> 00:28:56,111
You wouldn't want to lend
me this pad, would you?

448
00:28:56,278 --> 00:28:57,279
Just for the night.

449
00:28:57,988 --> 00:29:00,824
Only I got this dame parked
outside I wanna impress.

450
00:29:01,158 --> 00:29:03,202
As in, she actually is a dame.

451
00:29:04,286 --> 00:29:05,954
And, well, you know.

452
00:29:06,914 --> 00:29:09,458
My place ain't
exactly the Savoy.

453
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:12,002
I thought his place
exactly was the Savoy.

454
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:14,671
No, he didn't take up residence
there till a month later.

455
00:29:15,172 --> 00:29:17,508
And the production company
footed the bill when he did.

456
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:21,178
How he finagled that,
I'll never know.

457
00:29:21,345 --> 00:29:24,056
Either I need a new agent,
or he had dirt on Woolf.

458
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,146
Did you ever meet these women?

459
00:29:32,231 --> 00:29:33,232
Who were they?

460
00:29:33,732 --> 00:29:35,984
Girls he met during the war
who had low standards...

461
00:29:36,193 --> 00:29:37,486
and even lower self-esteem.

462
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:38,987
I never had the pleasure.

463
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:42,407
Oh, wait.

464
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:44,867
Tell a lie.

465
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:48,664
Merv! Come on.

466
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,750
When I said we should tear up the
script, I didn't mean literally!

467
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:57,130
Hello, Leo.

468
00:29:57,297 --> 00:29:58,423
What is that doing here?

469
00:29:59,675 --> 00:30:01,051
He was Kopernick's son!

470
00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:02,469
Peas in a pod.

471
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:04,054
And the mother?

472
00:30:04,221 --> 00:30:07,683
I didn't get a good look. A
plain girl, rather homely.

473
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:09,935
<i>Dark hair, glasses...</i>

474
00:30:10,102 --> 00:30:11,144
thick lenses.

475
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:14,082
So there we have it,
sir. <i>Cherchez la femme.</i>

476
00:30:14,106 --> 00:30:15,106
What?

477
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:16,751
It's Belgian, sir. It
means, "Look for the woman."

478
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:19,111
I know what it means,
Constable. What woman?

479
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:21,405
The mother of Kopernick's
illegitimate son.

480
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:25,075
Cocker-Norris couldn't remember her name,
but I bet it's in that little black book.

481
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:27,428
You know, the one that you
found in the hotel room, sir.

482
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:28,954
If we find her, we
have our answer.

483
00:30:29,121 --> 00:30:31,099
We need to get a police sketch
artist down here at once...

484
00:30:31,123 --> 00:30:32,416
before he forgets anything.

485
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:37,379
I'm doing it again,
aren't I, sir?

486
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,757
- Jumping to conclusions.
- Conclusions, yeah. Little bit.

487
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:41,925
Sorry.

488
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:43,510
Constable.

489
00:30:45,804 --> 00:30:47,681
I have a very important
mission for you.

490
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:51,310
I need you to find
a telephone box.

491
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:52,477
Call the station.

492
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:55,439
Get an address for John
Woolf, the film producer.

493
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:56,899
And I'll wait for you here.

494
00:30:57,316 --> 00:30:59,484
"Romulus Films, Soho,"
sir. I wrote it down.

495
00:31:00,569 --> 00:31:01,987
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

496
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:06,241
Right.

497
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:08,035
Well done. Thank you.

498
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:10,453
Shall we?

499
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:23,467
Telegram came for you.

500
00:31:26,637 --> 00:31:27,638
Bad news?

501
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:28,804
It's the studio.

502
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:30,909
Grace Kelly's doing a
Hitchcock picture for Warner...

503
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:32,601
so it's Dial M for
Maybe Next Time.

504
00:31:32,768 --> 00:31:34,228
- Grace Kelly?
- Yes.

505
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:35,663
For the part you
promised Sheila?

506
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:36,897
Yes, that's right.

507
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:40,150
Which is why this
is such good news.

508
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:43,694
Ann?

509
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:44,947
Darling, what's the matter?

510
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:47,449
You do know a promise is only
a promise if you keep it.

511
00:31:47,616 --> 00:31:48,616
What do you mean?

512
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:49,969
I mean you promised me
a night out months ago.

513
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:51,119
I have been so busy lately.

514
00:31:51,286 --> 00:31:52,514
Yes, I know. I am
your assistant.

515
00:31:52,538 --> 00:31:54,307
I promise, as soon as I
have a moment to spare...

516
00:31:54,331 --> 00:31:55,707
Well, you're free on Wednesday.

517
00:31:55,874 --> 00:31:57,376
- Am I? Are you sure?
- Yes.

518
00:31:57,543 --> 00:31:59,086
- I thought I was...
- No.

519
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:00,712
No, well, you should know.

520
00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:02,548
You are my assistant, after all.

521
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:04,383
Well, that's settled,
then. It's a date.

522
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,926
I promise I will take you out.

523
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:07,445
I'm afraid, Mr. Woolf, you
really must be going now...

524
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:08,554
otherwise you'll be late.

525
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,763
Right. Thank you.

526
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:13,827
No, I'm serious. You do actually
need to get back to Romulus.

527
00:32:13,851 --> 00:32:14,852
- Right. Okay. Yes.
- Yes.

528
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:26,947
This is exciting, isn't it, sir?

529
00:32:27,114 --> 00:32:28,174
I'd say this is the
type of thing...

530
00:32:28,198 --> 00:32:30,450
that made you want to become
a police officer, was it?

531
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:38,375
Me? I just sort of
fell into it, really.

532
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:41,753
They needed people after the war,
and I needed the money, so...

533
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:46,300
No, it's true. The hours
can be unsociable...

534
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:48,278
but I can't type or stand
the sight of blood...

535
00:32:48,302 --> 00:32:50,596
so that ruled out
secretary for me.

536
00:32:57,102 --> 00:32:58,830
You don't mind if I pick
your brains, do you, sir?

537
00:32:58,854 --> 00:33:00,772
Only I have sergeants'
exams in a month...

538
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:03,459
and I just have one or two questions
that I'd love to run by you.

539
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:06,403
Actually, Constable, I've just
remembered that I have a...

540
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:08,614
dentist appointment.

541
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:11,366
Sorry, sir. I didn't
know you were suffering.

542
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:12,618
Just a routine checkup.

543
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:14,286
- What shall I do, sir?
- Wait here.

544
00:33:14,453 --> 00:33:16,371
But what if Woolf turns up, sir?

545
00:33:16,955 --> 00:33:19,541
Won't be long. And
you have your...

546
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:20,708
notebook.

547
00:33:23,253 --> 00:33:24,379
Keep your eyes peeled.

548
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:25,546
Yes, sir.

549
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:56,620
- Gin.
- Gin?

550
00:33:56,787 --> 00:33:58,121
Yeah, please.

551
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:11,385
You're joking.

552
00:34:14,096 --> 00:34:15,222
Oh, no.

553
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:22,353
Oh, God.

554
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:42,666
Follow this up with
another, please.

555
00:35:25,918 --> 00:35:27,294
There you are, Constable.

556
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:30,964
I've been looking
all over for you.

557
00:35:33,926 --> 00:35:35,636
So, I gather it was you...

558
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:40,182
that paid for Mr. Kopernick's
rather extravagant hotel suite.

559
00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:42,017
Nothing unusual in
that, Inspector.

560
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:47,189
I'm afraid a producer is expected
to indulge the whims of the talent.

561
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:50,150
Especially when
they're American.

562
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:53,070
But still, a pretty penny,
a room at the Savoy.

563
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:54,238
Par for the course.

564
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:56,365
When I was in the Congo...

565
00:35:56,532 --> 00:35:57,574
for <i>The African Queen...</i>

566
00:35:57,741 --> 00:36:01,620
Huston and Bogart refused
to drink the water.

567
00:36:01,787 --> 00:36:03,455
Insisted on bourbon...

568
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:04,873
even to brush their teeth.

569
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,584
Not so easy to get hold of in
the jungle, I can assure you.

570
00:36:09,086 --> 00:36:11,839
You know, Constable Stalker here
is a great admirer of that film.

571
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:13,173
Aren't you, Constable?

572
00:36:15,634 --> 00:36:17,135
It's a marvelous film, sir.

573
00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:19,179
Why, thank you, Constable.

574
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:20,931
Encyclopedia.

575
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:22,808
Cinematic encyclopedia up there.

576
00:36:22,975 --> 00:36:24,476
- I wouldn't say that.
- Yeah.

577
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:25,811
Right.

578
00:36:25,978 --> 00:36:27,271
Being humble.

579
00:36:27,437 --> 00:36:28,772
I'm not.

580
00:36:28,939 --> 00:36:31,275
So, it's not true that
Kopernick had dirt on you?

581
00:36:37,281 --> 00:36:38,782
Who told you that?

582
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:02,472
Well, now what do we have here?

583
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:06,393
Woolfie?

584
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,105
Sittin' in a quiet corner,
all very nice and intimate.

585
00:37:12,274 --> 00:37:14,568
Say, you wouldn't mind if
I joined you, would you?

586
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,403
Not at all, old boy.

587
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:21,408
And you must be Mrs. Woolf, huh?

588
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:23,493
Swell to make your acquaintance.

589
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:26,580
No, no. Leo, this is Ann.

590
00:37:26,747 --> 00:37:27,915
She's my assistant.

591
00:37:30,501 --> 00:37:31,752
Workin' late, huh?

592
00:37:33,879 --> 00:37:34,963
If you'll excuse me...

593
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:36,840
I'm sorry.

594
00:37:39,384 --> 00:37:40,719
You have a nice night, now.

595
00:37:44,348 --> 00:37:45,349
Well, now.

596
00:37:47,643 --> 00:37:49,353
This puts me in a tough spot.

597
00:37:51,813 --> 00:37:54,274
That I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to take advantage of.

598
00:37:56,902 --> 00:38:00,113
<i>He asked to be put up at
the Savoy, and I agreed.</i>

599
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,616
I knew it wouldn't be for long.

600
00:38:02,783 --> 00:38:05,536
That is, just until I found
the right moment to...

601
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,163
tell my wife.

602
00:38:10,582 --> 00:38:12,960
I see. Well...

603
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:15,045
we'll be in touch if
there's anything else.

604
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,174
Constable.

605
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,634
Shall we?

606
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:31,937
But, sir, Woolf killed Kopernick
to hush up the affair. Case closed.

607
00:38:32,104 --> 00:38:35,064
I think if that was the case, he wouldn't
have volunteered the information.

608
00:38:36,233 --> 00:38:38,318
So, then he's in the clear?

609
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:39,319
No, not necessarily.

610
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:41,806
He might have killed Kopernick
for another reason entirely.

611
00:38:43,782 --> 00:38:44,782
I tell you...

612
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:47,828
I'll never get the hang of this
in time for sergeants' exams.

613
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:55,169
Constable, about earlier.

614
00:38:55,377 --> 00:38:57,880
I know it looked like I'd
just come out of the pub.

615
00:38:58,046 --> 00:38:59,882
You had just come
out of the pub.

616
00:39:00,048 --> 00:39:01,675
That's right.

617
00:39:01,842 --> 00:39:04,761
But I'd only gone in there to get
rid of the taste of the mouthwash.

618
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:06,680
So you had a gin, sir.

619
00:39:08,098 --> 00:39:09,933
It's an antiseptic.
I had a filling.

620
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,977
I thought you said it
was a routine checkup.

621
00:39:13,854 --> 00:39:17,024
I see we've read the chapter
on interrogation techniques.

622
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,651
Sir...

623
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:22,112
I know I haven't done
anything yet to impress you...

624
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:26,575
or to inspire any
confidence, and...

625
00:39:26,742 --> 00:39:28,902
I know you'd probably rather
that I wasn't on the case.

626
00:39:28,994 --> 00:39:32,289
But I didn't ask to be put
on this case either, sir.

627
00:39:32,456 --> 00:39:34,666
I was nervous, and I still am...

628
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:36,752
and I'm probably
trying a bit too hard.

629
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:39,421
But, you know, even if
I do make mistakes...

630
00:39:39,588 --> 00:39:40,839
or if I jump to conclusions...

631
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:43,800
or talk a little bit too
much, that has been said...

632
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:48,805
I just want you to know
that you can trust me.

633
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:49,973
Sir.

634
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:55,062
Okay. Good.

635
00:41:17,352 --> 00:41:18,604
You're joking.

636
00:41:20,272 --> 00:41:22,232
- Constable.
- Commissioner.

637
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:23,400
Stoppard about?

638
00:41:24,026 --> 00:41:25,826
No, sir. He's not yet
made it in this morning.

639
00:41:25,861 --> 00:41:26,945
It's almost eleven o'clock.

640
00:41:27,696 --> 00:41:29,781
He had a dentist
appointment, sir.

641
00:41:29,948 --> 00:41:32,428
A filling, I think he said it
was. A molar, it might have been?

642
00:41:32,576 --> 00:41:35,454
I have been summoned
to the Home Secretary.

643
00:41:35,621 --> 00:41:36,914
He wants a debrief.

644
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,373
I said I had good news.

645
00:41:45,714 --> 00:41:47,841
Have you seen the play, sir?

646
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:51,220
Yes.

647
00:41:51,386 --> 00:41:53,305
I'm afraid I took the
wife for her birthday.

648
00:41:54,264 --> 00:41:57,392
Of course, it didn't fool me for a
moment. I knew who did it right away.

649
00:41:59,311 --> 00:42:01,104
She was baffled, though.

650
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:03,649
Even after the chap
explained everything.

651
00:42:03,815 --> 00:42:06,944
It was a trying night
for all concerned.

652
00:42:08,445 --> 00:42:09,738
I'll stick to flowers in future.

653
00:42:09,947 --> 00:42:11,782
Yes, always a safe bet, sir.

654
00:42:14,451 --> 00:42:15,494
Sorry.

655
00:42:15,661 --> 00:42:16,662
Police.

656
00:42:16,828 --> 00:42:18,705
Please try to be
more careful, sir.

657
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,756
Good morning.

658
00:42:28,507 --> 00:42:30,133
- Commissioner.
- Inspector.

659
00:42:31,927 --> 00:42:33,387
Is it wise to eat so many mints?

660
00:42:33,554 --> 00:42:34,554
How do you mean, sir?

661
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:36,515
Well...

662
00:42:36,682 --> 00:42:38,162
haven't you just
been to the dentist?

663
00:42:40,102 --> 00:42:41,228
Yes, that's right, sir.

664
00:42:41,395 --> 00:42:42,938
Yeah. It was just a checkup.

665
00:42:45,107 --> 00:42:47,317
Although I did have
a filling as well.

666
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:49,862
Since I was there.

667
00:42:50,028 --> 00:42:51,828
I've come down here for
an update, Inspector.

668
00:42:51,947 --> 00:42:53,907
- We have good news, sir.
- We do?

669
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:56,719
Yes, sir. Isn't that what
you told the Home Secretary?

670
00:42:56,743 --> 00:43:00,789
Yes, that's what I told the
Home Secretary on the telephone.

671
00:43:00,956 --> 00:43:02,457
I came down here to get it.

672
00:43:03,584 --> 00:43:05,210
So we don't have good news?

673
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:06,420
We do have a witness, sir.

674
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:07,629
To the murder?

675
00:43:07,796 --> 00:43:09,965
Yeah, that would be
nice, wouldn't it?

676
00:43:10,132 --> 00:43:12,551
No. One of the ushers saw
a suspicious character.

677
00:43:13,135 --> 00:43:14,720
He's waiting for us inside.

678
00:43:15,512 --> 00:43:16,889
Very well.

679
00:43:17,055 --> 00:43:20,267
I'll tell the Home Secretary
we have a promising lead.

680
00:43:20,434 --> 00:43:22,853
And I'll rely on you not
to make a liar out of me.

681
00:43:23,812 --> 00:43:25,272
- Constable.
- Commissioner.

682
00:43:25,439 --> 00:43:26,940
Inspector.

683
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:28,108
Commissioner.

684
00:43:30,736 --> 00:43:31,737
Constable.

685
00:43:31,904 --> 00:43:32,905
Inspector.

686
00:43:36,283 --> 00:43:37,868
<i>So, Dennis...</i>

687
00:43:38,035 --> 00:43:40,162
I understand that you saw
something the other night.

688
00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:42,206
- Yeah.
- What'd you see?

689
00:43:42,372 --> 00:43:45,167
Well, I'd gone to get a bottle
of Scotch for the dead man.

690
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:49,713
This was before,
you know, he died.

691
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,881
And then you came back...

692
00:43:51,089 --> 00:43:52,901
and that's when you saw
the suspicious character?

693
00:43:52,925 --> 00:43:53,926
Exactly.

694
00:43:54,092 --> 00:43:56,053
Well, sort of.

695
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,889
I didn't get a very good
look, if I'm honest.

696
00:43:59,056 --> 00:44:02,434
He had on, like, a
darkish overcoat.

697
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:04,686
I see. Anything else?

698
00:44:06,939 --> 00:44:08,690
A pair of trousers.

699
00:44:08,857 --> 00:44:10,526
And a hat.

700
00:44:10,692 --> 00:44:12,486
It was on his head.

701
00:44:13,237 --> 00:44:14,738
Right. Yeah.

702
00:44:14,947 --> 00:44:17,407
Yeah. A soft, felt hat.

703
00:44:19,034 --> 00:44:20,386
What about a
physical description?

704
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:23,163
Was he a tall man?
Short? Thick set?

705
00:44:24,248 --> 00:44:25,415
Just average, I'd say.

706
00:44:25,582 --> 00:44:27,584
Average height or average build?

707
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:30,921
Both?

708
00:44:31,797 --> 00:44:32,923
No, don't ask me.

709
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:35,092
I don't know. I'm asking you.

710
00:44:36,635 --> 00:44:38,887
Average height...

711
00:44:39,054 --> 00:44:40,180
medium build.

712
00:44:40,389 --> 00:44:42,558
Would you say like
the Inspector?

713
00:44:42,724 --> 00:44:43,724
Yeah.

714
00:44:43,809 --> 00:44:44,893
Suppose so. Pretty much.

715
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,604
So what did he do that
made you suspicious?

716
00:44:48,438 --> 00:44:50,440
It wasn't so much what he did...

717
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:53,569
it was more, you know,
the way he did it.

718
00:44:54,528 --> 00:44:56,196
Right. How'd he do it?

719
00:44:56,613 --> 00:44:58,907
Well, sort of...

720
00:44:59,992 --> 00:45:01,577
suspiciously.

721
00:45:05,706 --> 00:45:07,624
This has been great.

722
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:09,376
Off you go.

723
00:45:10,043 --> 00:45:11,211
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

724
00:45:11,378 --> 00:45:12,379
Thank you.

725
00:45:14,214 --> 00:45:15,215
That was good.

726
00:45:15,382 --> 00:45:17,801
Do you think that went well?

727
00:45:19,261 --> 00:45:21,906
I think it's time we talk to that
actor who had a fight with Kopernick.

728
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:23,223
Mr. Attenborough, sir?

729
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:25,309
That's the one. Famous, is he?

730
00:45:25,475 --> 00:45:28,478
You're pulling my leg, sir.
You've never heard of Dickie?

731
00:45:28,645 --> 00:45:32,649
Richard Attenborough? Pinkie Brown?
<i>Brighton Rock?</i> You must have.

732
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:35,110
"You wanted a recording of
my voice. Well, here it is.

733
00:45:35,277 --> 00:45:37,070
"What you want me to
say is 'I love you.'"

734
00:45:37,237 --> 00:45:38,572
Keep in mind...

735
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:41,739
that we're here to conduct an interview
as part of a murder investigation...

736
00:45:41,825 --> 00:45:44,536
not an article for <i>Sight
& Sound</i> magazine, yes?

737
00:45:44,745 --> 00:45:45,746
Yes, sir.

738
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:48,916
Come in, darling.

739
00:45:51,376 --> 00:45:52,794
Inspector Stoppard.

740
00:45:52,961 --> 00:45:55,839
I say, a real-life detective.

741
00:45:56,006 --> 00:45:57,966
Scotland Yard and everything.

742
00:45:58,133 --> 00:45:59,218
And you are?

743
00:46:03,347 --> 00:46:05,265
This is...

744
00:46:05,432 --> 00:46:07,059
- Constable Stalker.
- Stalker.

745
00:46:09,353 --> 00:46:11,021
I like the way you did that.

746
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:12,231
Very natural.

747
00:46:12,898 --> 00:46:16,193
I hope you don't mind, sir,
but I just want to say bravo.

748
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,445
And encore.

749
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:20,590
All right, thank you, Constable.

750
00:46:20,614 --> 00:46:21,865
Yes, thank you, Constable.

751
00:46:22,032 --> 00:46:24,868
Are you a lover of theater? I
can get you tickets if you like.

752
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:28,163
I would like, sir.
Yes. Very much.

753
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:31,124
It would be good to get a
professional take on it.

754
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:33,794
Yeah. I have so many questions.

755
00:46:33,961 --> 00:46:35,337
I have one or two of my own.

756
00:46:35,671 --> 00:46:37,339
I dare say that you do.

757
00:46:38,257 --> 00:46:42,970
I understand that you and Kopernick
came to blows the night in question.

758
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:46,014
Was there a particular
reason for the ill feeling?

759
00:46:46,181 --> 00:46:48,725
Tell me, Inspector, did you
get your limp during the war?

760
00:46:51,562 --> 00:46:52,563
It's very slight.

761
00:46:52,729 --> 00:46:56,233
I noticed it the other night
when you were on stage. I...

762
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,069
Well, I thought I might
borrow it, if you don't mind.

763
00:46:59,236 --> 00:47:02,364
It's always good for the lead
character to have a physical defect.

764
00:47:02,531 --> 00:47:05,117
Speaks to a troubled soul.

765
00:47:05,617 --> 00:47:08,704
It was me, Inspector.
You need look no further.

766
00:47:08,871 --> 00:47:11,164
- I arrest you for the murder of Leo...
- No, no, no.

767
00:47:11,331 --> 00:47:12,541
No. Not yet.

768
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:13,709
Sorry, sir.

769
00:47:13,876 --> 00:47:16,628
I was the particular
reason for the ill feeling.

770
00:47:16,795 --> 00:47:20,299
Yes, well, Leo had his eye on Sheila,
you see. And I took exception.

771
00:47:20,465 --> 00:47:22,301
He was a real hound, Inspector.

772
00:47:26,138 --> 00:47:27,848
Come on, play nice.

773
00:47:28,056 --> 00:47:29,057
Maybe I can help you.

774
00:47:29,892 --> 00:47:30,934
Help me?

775
00:47:31,101 --> 00:47:32,102
To do what?

776
00:47:32,728 --> 00:47:35,063
Bag the lead role in the
film of <i>The Mousetrap.</i>

777
00:47:36,648 --> 00:47:37,900
Top billing.

778
00:47:38,066 --> 00:47:39,066
Make you a star.

779
00:47:39,193 --> 00:47:41,528
But I have bagged the lead role.

780
00:47:41,737 --> 00:47:43,071
Yeah, who told
you that, Woolfie?

781
00:47:43,238 --> 00:47:44,990
He is the producer.

782
00:47:45,157 --> 00:47:46,491
Honey, he just cuts the checks.

783
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:47,951
I'm the director.

784
00:47:48,243 --> 00:47:50,704
Without me, there is no
movie. You understand?

785
00:47:50,871 --> 00:47:52,831
You got a problem, buddy?

786
00:47:53,999 --> 00:47:55,876
Keep the change. And the glass.

787
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:58,587
And the studio, don't
they have a say in it?

788
00:47:58,754 --> 00:48:01,965
Rumor is they want to put
a name in the picture...

789
00:48:02,132 --> 00:48:04,343
that people have heard of.

790
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:06,803
Bona fide Hollywood star.

791
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:09,556
They like Grace Kelly.
You ever heard of her?

792
00:48:13,185 --> 00:48:14,478
Don't worry.

793
00:48:15,521 --> 00:48:17,022
They can be talked round.

794
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:21,443
I've got a very silver tongue.

795
00:48:26,657 --> 00:48:27,658
<i>I won't lie, Inspector.</i>

796
00:48:27,824 --> 00:48:31,745
I was not entirely sorry to learn of
his demise, but I had no part in it.

797
00:48:31,912 --> 00:48:34,352
Much like the film adaptation
of <i>The Mousetrap,</i> it would seem.

798
00:48:34,414 --> 00:48:35,974
Come now, darling,
you don't know that.

799
00:48:35,999 --> 00:48:37,626
Woolf promised you the role.

800
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,045
He's a man of his
word. He went to Eton.

801
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:41,713
Wake up, Dickie.

802
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,858
He's a man of whatever word
will get his film made.

803
00:48:43,882 --> 00:48:47,553
And that contract business with
Choo is coming apart at the seams.

804
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:49,096
- Choo?
- Bless you, sir.

805
00:48:49,263 --> 00:48:51,390
No, as in Petula Spencer.

806
00:48:51,723 --> 00:48:53,809
She sold Woolf the film rights.

807
00:48:53,976 --> 00:48:56,937
Well, about those tickets. Is
there a day that suits you better?

808
00:48:57,104 --> 00:48:59,857
I'm generally free on
Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

809
00:49:00,023 --> 00:49:00,858
And Thursdays.

810
00:49:01,024 --> 00:49:02,985
Well, thank you, sir.
Thank you, madam.

811
00:49:03,151 --> 00:49:04,754
No, no, not at all. We'll
be sure to let you know...

812
00:49:04,778 --> 00:49:06,780
if anything else
springs to mind.

813
00:49:06,947 --> 00:49:09,408
I'm sure it's always the
insignificant detail...

814
00:49:09,575 --> 00:49:12,953
that catches the killer in the
end. Isn't that so, Inspector?

815
00:49:16,456 --> 00:49:20,127
I don't usually have a
lot on on weekends either.

816
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:22,713
Or Mondays. For the tickets.

817
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,256
- Constable.
- Sir.

818
00:49:24,339 --> 00:49:25,339
Right.

819
00:49:59,374 --> 00:50:00,667
She'll see you now.

820
00:50:02,294 --> 00:50:04,379
So, you own this theater?

821
00:50:04,546 --> 00:50:06,840
Yes. Humble beginnings.

822
00:50:07,758 --> 00:50:09,092
You'll have to excuse Mother.

823
00:50:09,259 --> 00:50:13,430
She's not been herself since Father
died, in the first Great War.

824
00:50:14,014 --> 00:50:16,141
It's been a long 30 years.

825
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,976
It's nice that you
gave her a job.

826
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:20,604
Well, how else is she
gonna pay the rent?

827
00:50:21,063 --> 00:50:23,143
I let her have the spare
room at a discount as it is.

828
00:50:23,857 --> 00:50:25,943
Yes, no. You can stop there.

829
00:50:26,193 --> 00:50:28,862
We get the idea. Bravo.

830
00:50:29,279 --> 00:50:33,075
I understand that you handled the sale of
<i>The Mousetrap</i> film rights to John Woolf?

831
00:50:33,283 --> 00:50:35,744
Yes, that's right.
I did. Wait... Why?

832
00:50:36,662 --> 00:50:37,829
What's he been saying?

833
00:50:38,664 --> 00:50:40,165
Oh, he's such a crybaby.

834
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:44,211
Honestly, he acts as though
I put a gun to his head.

835
00:50:48,382 --> 00:50:50,175
Hang on a minute.
Is this important?

836
00:50:50,342 --> 00:50:51,502
I doubt it. What does it say?

837
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:54,304
"No motion picture based on
the stage play <i>The Mousetrap...</i>

838
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:57,933
"is to enter into production until a
minimum of six months have elapsed...

839
00:50:58,141 --> 00:50:59,901
"since the end of its
first theatrical run."

840
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,770
Oh, you don't need
to worry about that.

841
00:51:01,937 --> 00:51:04,218
It's a whodunit. As soon as
word gets out who did do it...

842
00:51:04,314 --> 00:51:05,941
audiences are bound to drop off.

843
00:51:06,108 --> 00:51:09,945
Come on, sign on the dotted
line, and I'll make a toast.

844
00:51:14,241 --> 00:51:18,787
Ann, darling, the next contract I
sign will be our marriage certificate.

845
00:51:18,996 --> 00:51:23,458
Well, first it'll be the divorce papers.
But then our marriage certificate.

846
00:51:26,253 --> 00:51:27,337
Edana, darling.

847
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:29,381
What a pleasant surprise.

848
00:51:29,548 --> 00:51:31,925
You know Choo and Ann.

849
00:51:32,384 --> 00:51:33,218
I do.

850
00:51:33,385 --> 00:51:35,071
Dear girl, what on Earth
are you doing down there?

851
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:37,472
I just fell over. Excuse me.

852
00:51:38,348 --> 00:51:41,101
Honestly, it's like having
Buster Keaton for an assistant.

853
00:51:41,268 --> 00:51:42,978
Now, I've just come
from Madame Zena...

854
00:51:43,353 --> 00:51:45,123
Darling, I really wish
you wouldn't see that...

855
00:51:45,147 --> 00:51:46,416
Please don't call
her a charlatan.

856
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,640
I was going to say "crackpot."

857
00:51:51,361 --> 00:51:53,071
- What's this?
- It's a Tarot card.

858
00:51:53,363 --> 00:51:55,032
I can see that.
What does it mean?

859
00:51:55,824 --> 00:51:56,825
Betrayal.

860
00:52:03,874 --> 00:52:05,876
Betrayal as in his
affair, not the contract.

861
00:52:06,293 --> 00:52:08,462
That was above board.
Is above board.

862
00:52:08,837 --> 00:52:11,215
Agatha insisted on
that clause, not me.

863
00:52:11,381 --> 00:52:14,718
No, she's fiercely protective of
her own work, you see, because...

864
00:52:14,885 --> 00:52:16,428
Well, she has to be.

865
00:52:16,803 --> 00:52:18,555
People get so riled up.

866
00:52:18,722 --> 00:52:20,390
She's had death
threats, you know.

867
00:52:20,557 --> 00:52:23,435
Poor girl can't write so much
as a letter to <i>The Times...</i>

868
00:52:23,602 --> 00:52:25,270
without a deluge
of legal action...

869
00:52:25,437 --> 00:52:28,607
and spurious claims she stole
this plot or that character.

870
00:52:28,899 --> 00:52:30,734
Isn't that what
happened here, though?

871
00:52:30,901 --> 00:52:33,320
Isn't <i>The Mousetrap</i>
based on a true story?

872
00:52:34,404 --> 00:52:37,699
Yes. Well, originally.
I mean, tangentially.

873
00:52:38,242 --> 00:52:40,118
In any case, that's
the reason...

874
00:52:40,285 --> 00:52:42,829
Woolf was so keen to shut
the theater the other night.

875
00:52:42,996 --> 00:52:47,000
He can't make his film until the
play ends its run in the West End.

876
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:50,295
As it is, what with the play
being such a phenomenal success...

877
00:52:50,462 --> 00:52:53,215
he's stuck in
theatrical purgatory.

878
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:56,218
He's a ruthless
customer, is Woolf.

879
00:52:57,177 --> 00:52:59,721
He'll stop at nothing
to get his film made.

880
00:53:05,936 --> 00:53:07,437
<i>It's definitely Woolf, sir.</i>

881
00:53:08,272 --> 00:53:10,315
Well, not 100%.

882
00:53:10,482 --> 00:53:14,069
More like 73-74%, I'd say.

883
00:53:14,862 --> 00:53:18,490
He killed Kopernick in the theater
to force it to close down...

884
00:53:18,657 --> 00:53:20,367
so that he could make his film.

885
00:53:20,534 --> 00:53:22,452
He could marry his mistress.

886
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:24,379
And then he could get
shot of a blackmailer.

887
00:53:24,496 --> 00:53:26,123
It's not Woolf.
It's too elaborate.

888
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:28,208
Burn the place down, if
that's what you want.

889
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:30,794
Besides, doesn't he need
a director to make a film?

890
00:53:31,753 --> 00:53:34,506
Well, then it's back to
Cocker-Norris. Process of elimination.

891
00:53:35,465 --> 00:53:36,842
No, it's not Mervyn.

892
00:53:37,009 --> 00:53:38,760
Yeah, but the tongue business.

893
00:53:39,553 --> 00:53:41,346
And he clearly didn't
like Leo, did he?

894
00:53:44,349 --> 00:53:47,349
People don't rip out other people's
tongues because of creative differences.

895
00:53:47,394 --> 00:53:48,896
They do it out of revenge...

896
00:53:49,897 --> 00:53:51,537
or rage because they've
lost a loved one.

897
00:53:51,648 --> 00:53:52,792
They can't forgive or forget...

898
00:53:52,816 --> 00:53:55,277
so they just stew and
fester alone in the dark...

899
00:53:55,444 --> 00:53:59,114
until finally it all comes out in
a sudden, frenzied act of violence.

900
00:54:04,703 --> 00:54:07,664
How did you get the limp, sir?
If you don't mind me asking.

901
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:11,376
In the war. Got shot
in the Italian Alps.

902
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:14,880
Sounds painful.

903
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,341
What do you...

904
00:54:19,718 --> 00:54:20,719
Sorry, sir.

905
00:54:20,886 --> 00:54:23,055
No, that's very funny.

906
00:54:24,681 --> 00:54:26,808
Is there a Mr. Stalker, Stalker?

907
00:54:27,601 --> 00:54:29,686
I'm afraid he died
in the war, sir.

908
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:32,731
Children?

909
00:54:32,898 --> 00:54:33,899
A boy and a girl.

910
00:54:34,399 --> 00:54:35,442
Can't be easy.

911
00:54:36,527 --> 00:54:38,946
What about you? Do you
have any family, sir?

912
00:54:40,489 --> 00:54:43,825
I came close, once. Yeah,
I had an unfaithful wife.

913
00:54:45,702 --> 00:54:48,789
She was eight months pregnant when
she told me I wasn't the father.

914
00:54:50,749 --> 00:54:52,751
I'd made a cot and everything.

915
00:54:53,877 --> 00:54:56,088
That's awful, sir. I'm sorry.

916
00:54:59,383 --> 00:55:01,218
- Landlord.
- Yes, sir?

917
00:55:01,385 --> 00:55:02,385
Another round.

918
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:03,636
Oh, I don't know.

919
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:07,474
Should we maybe get going,
sir? Got work tomorrow.

920
00:55:10,185 --> 00:55:12,813
Go on, steer off before
I call the police!

921
00:55:14,773 --> 00:55:16,441
Sorry again. Thank you.

922
00:55:17,317 --> 00:55:19,152
Are you sure you're all
right to drive, sir?

923
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:20,445
Absolutely.

924
00:55:21,613 --> 00:55:23,699
I could run you
home if you like.

925
00:55:37,713 --> 00:55:40,757
Now. Just gonna pop you there.

926
00:55:41,675 --> 00:55:43,552
I can take it from
here, Constable.

927
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:49,600
Sir.

928
00:55:56,231 --> 00:55:57,232
There we go.

929
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:14,518
Morning, sir.

930
00:57:15,644 --> 00:57:16,645
What do you want?

931
00:57:18,355 --> 00:57:20,774
The other night,
sir. The dead Yank.

932
00:57:20,941 --> 00:57:23,986
Inspector Stoppard got the call
and not Leeke or Priestley.

933
00:57:24,903 --> 00:57:25,904
So?

934
00:57:35,664 --> 00:57:40,043
Leeke was in Skegness on his honeymoon, and
Priestley took the Rillington Place call.

935
00:57:42,296 --> 00:57:43,297
What time?

936
00:57:44,923 --> 00:57:48,051
Half-past 11:00. <i>Book
at Bedtime</i> was on.

937
00:57:53,891 --> 00:57:56,101
Did you ever meet
Stoppard's wife, sir?

938
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:58,061
I did.

939
00:57:58,228 --> 00:58:00,105
You don't happen to
remember her name, do you?

940
00:58:07,279 --> 00:58:08,405
It was...

941
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:11,992
Mrs. Stoppard.

942
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:15,871
Brilliant.

943
00:58:33,388 --> 00:58:34,932
Hello, is this Abigale?

944
00:58:37,059 --> 00:58:38,185
Hello, is this Beryl?

945
00:58:38,352 --> 00:58:40,521
I am a friend of
Leo Kopernick's.

946
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:42,981
Beryl?

947
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:46,485
Is Geraldine there
by any chance?

948
00:59:13,846 --> 00:59:14,972
- Oh, Constable.
- Sir.

949
00:59:15,848 --> 00:59:18,100
Did Dickie ever come through
on those theater tickets?

950
00:59:18,267 --> 00:59:20,936
I thought of going, and
maybe the play's the thing.

951
00:59:21,728 --> 00:59:24,940
Ties this all together.
Would you like to tag along?

952
00:59:25,274 --> 00:59:26,316
Yes, sir.

953
00:59:28,777 --> 00:59:29,777
What is it, Constable?

954
00:59:30,654 --> 00:59:31,738
Nothing, sir.

955
00:59:32,906 --> 00:59:35,158
Do you want a cup of tea?

956
00:59:36,827 --> 00:59:37,995
Listen to me, Stalker.

957
00:59:38,537 --> 00:59:42,457
No one is ever going to take you
seriously as a police officer...

958
00:59:42,624 --> 00:59:44,269
if you act like a
tea-lady, do you hear me?

959
00:59:44,293 --> 00:59:45,627
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

960
00:59:45,794 --> 00:59:47,296
Milk and two sugars.

961
00:59:51,842 --> 00:59:52,843
Commissioner.

962
01:00:00,392 --> 01:00:04,563
I said, "Who do you want? Agatha
Christie or Mervyn Cocker-Norris?

963
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:07,482
"Anyone can do her,
but only I can do me."

964
01:00:09,818 --> 01:00:13,447
<i>The Mousetrap</i> in the
house style, as it were.

965
01:00:13,614 --> 01:00:17,743
I'll take the bare bones of the story,
a rather mundane tale of child abuse...

966
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:19,203
and make it my own.

967
01:00:23,081 --> 01:00:24,082
Here we are.

968
01:00:25,751 --> 01:00:27,211
These aren't together, sir.

969
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:30,464
Well, we can cover
more ground that way.

970
01:00:30,631 --> 01:00:31,673
Keep your eyes peeled.

971
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:32,841
Yes, sir.

972
01:00:43,352 --> 01:00:44,353
Cheers.

973
01:00:57,241 --> 01:00:58,242
Hello?

974
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:02,621
Hello?

975
01:01:03,372 --> 01:01:04,831
Is anyone there?

976
01:01:05,791 --> 01:01:08,043
Who's calling at this late hour?

977
01:01:09,253 --> 01:01:10,254
Yes?

978
01:01:10,838 --> 01:01:11,839
All right then.

979
01:01:12,923 --> 01:01:16,635
That was Scotland Yard. They're
sending out an inspector.

980
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:21,265
In this unseasonable
blizzard? What on Earth for?

981
01:01:22,641 --> 01:01:23,642
Good Lord.

982
01:01:25,894 --> 01:01:27,896
- Inspector.
- Thank you.

983
01:01:29,398 --> 01:01:30,399
Good evening.

984
01:01:32,609 --> 01:01:34,945
I am Detective Sergeant Trotter.

985
01:01:35,779 --> 01:01:37,155
Please excuse the limp.

986
01:01:37,322 --> 01:01:40,117
An old war wound
playing up in the cold.

987
01:01:40,284 --> 01:01:42,828
I'm assuming you were
warned of my arrival?

988
01:01:44,288 --> 01:01:47,499
Apropos of nothing,
I'm a magistrate.

989
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:50,419
Also, he looks too young
to be an inspector.

990
01:01:50,586 --> 01:01:53,630
Well, I'm old enough to
remember the Corrigan Case.

991
01:01:53,797 --> 01:01:57,217
Yes, a dreadful business.

992
01:01:57,759 --> 01:02:01,305
Two brothers who put their faith
in the British social services.

993
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:05,017
A sorry tale of abuse
that ended in tragedy.

994
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,103
Yes, it was in
all of the papers.

995
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:09,664
Gio, I can't sit
through this again.

996
01:02:09,688 --> 01:02:11,815
I'm sorry. Will you excuse me?

997
01:02:11,982 --> 01:02:15,402
One died, the other
left traumatized.

998
01:02:16,904 --> 01:02:21,200
I shudder to think what an ordeal like
that might do to a vulnerable mind.

999
01:02:21,408 --> 01:02:23,785
Won't be a moment. I'm just
going to try and catch Mervyn.

1000
01:02:23,952 --> 01:02:25,662
Oh, bother. I forgot the tea.

1001
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:28,916
By God, that has to be
the worst cup of tea...

1002
01:02:29,082 --> 01:02:30,542
I've ever had.

1003
01:02:32,044 --> 01:02:33,629
I agree.

1004
01:02:34,379 --> 01:02:37,799
Did you make it in a
teapot or a plant pot?

1005
01:02:38,133 --> 01:02:40,213
- Pardon me. Excuse me. Thank you. Sorry.
- Oh, dear.

1006
01:02:40,427 --> 01:02:42,572
- Pardon me. Excuse me. Sorry.
- I've already had another disaster...

1007
01:02:42,596 --> 01:02:44,014
in the kitchen.

1008
01:02:44,765 --> 01:02:48,101
I left out the steak pieces
in my steak and kidney pie.

1009
01:02:49,478 --> 01:02:50,479
Gloves.

1010
01:02:51,021 --> 01:02:52,665
Kidney pie just doesn't
have the same ring to it.

1011
01:02:52,689 --> 01:02:54,274
Sorry. Excuse me. Pardon me.

1012
01:02:54,441 --> 01:02:55,692
Excuse me. Terribly sorry.

1013
01:02:56,777 --> 01:02:58,487
Bleeding gloves. I'm so sorry.

1014
01:02:58,654 --> 01:03:02,324
There they are. Thank you.
Sorry. Sorry. Terribly sorry.

1015
01:03:02,491 --> 01:03:03,968
I'm beginning to think it was a
dreadful mistake to skip lunch.

1016
01:03:03,992 --> 01:03:05,452
Excuse me.

1017
01:03:06,787 --> 01:03:08,622
I'll open a tin of peas.

1018
01:03:45,242 --> 01:03:47,160
<i>We interrupt</i> Book at Bedtime...

1019
01:03:47,703 --> 01:03:51,415
<i>to warn residents in the
Colney Hatch area of London...</i>

1020
01:03:51,582 --> 01:03:55,002
<i>to be on the lookout
for an escaped lunatic.</i>

1021
01:04:12,853 --> 01:04:13,854
You startled me.

1022
01:04:15,564 --> 01:04:16,732
You startled me.

1023
01:04:52,643 --> 01:04:53,977
Turn the lights on.

1024
01:05:19,336 --> 01:05:21,463
Stop in the name of the law!

1025
01:05:32,182 --> 01:05:33,267
Bollocks!

1026
01:05:37,771 --> 01:05:39,851
Well, that's a good thing.
The limp, was it too much?

1027
01:05:42,609 --> 01:05:43,610
Oh, God.

1028
01:05:43,777 --> 01:05:45,737
Oh, sorry, sir. I thought
you were somebody else.

1029
01:05:45,904 --> 01:05:47,072
No, no, it's all right.

1030
01:05:47,364 --> 01:05:48,657
And thank you for the tickets.

1031
01:05:48,824 --> 01:05:49,908
Very welcome.

1032
01:06:39,958 --> 01:06:41,084
There ya go.

1033
01:06:41,376 --> 01:06:42,503
Bottoms up.

1034
01:06:42,669 --> 01:06:43,670
Cheers.

1035
01:06:48,842 --> 01:06:50,511
What brings you to
this neck of the woods?

1036
01:06:50,677 --> 01:06:52,513
Oh, a murder investigation.

1037
01:06:52,679 --> 01:06:54,890
Yeah? Anyone I know?

1038
01:06:56,225 --> 01:06:57,226
You.

1039
01:07:00,896 --> 01:07:02,147
I'm sorry, I thought...

1040
01:07:02,314 --> 01:07:04,399
No, no, no. It's all
right. It's all right.

1041
01:07:05,984 --> 01:07:07,736
Say, Inspector.

1042
01:07:09,112 --> 01:07:11,657
Tell me, was anyone...

1043
01:07:13,408 --> 01:07:15,827
you know, sad to see me go?

1044
01:07:22,459 --> 01:07:23,459
Figures.

1045
01:07:31,593 --> 01:07:33,387
I'm sorry, sir, you
can't go in there.

1046
01:07:34,513 --> 01:07:36,113
You can only go in
if you have a ticket.

1047
01:07:36,181 --> 01:07:37,975
I had a ticket. It
was in my pocket.

1048
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,812
That's... I could have sworn
I had on a pair of trousers.

1049
01:07:42,312 --> 01:07:43,564
I had trousers on.

1050
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:46,440
Where's my ticket?

1051
01:07:46,942 --> 01:07:49,403
I'm sorry, sir. I can't let you
in unless you have a ticket.

1052
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:51,864
I had a ticket. I just
don't have it on me.

1053
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:53,991
Let me in! Stop mucking about.

1054
01:07:54,157 --> 01:07:55,637
- I've gotta go in.
- No, please, sir.

1055
01:07:58,662 --> 01:07:59,955
You. I know you.

1056
01:08:01,665 --> 01:08:02,666
What are you doing?

1057
01:08:04,376 --> 01:08:06,086
<i>Sir. Sir.</i>

1058
01:08:06,253 --> 01:08:07,253
I've got a ticket!

1059
01:08:12,759 --> 01:08:14,136
The hell is going on?

1060
01:08:17,805 --> 01:08:19,015
What am I doing here?

1061
01:08:19,975 --> 01:08:21,475
What happened to my trousers?

1062
01:08:21,643 --> 01:08:22,935
You asked me to press them, sir.

1063
01:08:23,103 --> 01:08:24,104
I did?

1064
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:25,564
Yes, sir. You were adamant.

1065
01:08:28,483 --> 01:08:29,902
How long have I been here?

1066
01:08:30,444 --> 01:08:31,528
Eighteen hours.

1067
01:08:35,741 --> 01:08:37,533
My head is killing me.

1068
01:08:37,701 --> 01:08:39,368
It's bloody freezing in here.

1069
01:08:41,455 --> 01:08:42,622
Did you make an arrest?

1070
01:08:44,166 --> 01:08:45,167
We did.

1071
01:08:45,876 --> 01:08:47,586
Who was it? Was it Gio?

1072
01:08:47,752 --> 01:08:48,754
Gio?

1073
01:08:49,421 --> 01:08:52,716
Yeah, Gio. The Italian
chap, the killer.

1074
01:08:52,883 --> 01:08:55,636
The man in a darkish
overcoat, soft felt hat...

1075
01:08:55,801 --> 01:08:57,304
I chased out the theater.

1076
01:08:57,470 --> 01:08:59,305
Inspector, that man was you.

1077
01:08:59,848 --> 01:09:00,848
What?

1078
01:09:01,099 --> 01:09:04,019
You are the man in the
darkish overcoat...

1079
01:09:04,228 --> 01:09:07,356
and the soft felt hat that
Constable Stalker here...

1080
01:09:08,023 --> 01:09:09,566
chased from the theater.

1081
01:09:10,817 --> 01:09:13,569
I'm sorry, I'm not following.

1082
01:09:13,737 --> 01:09:15,488
I think I might
have a concussion.

1083
01:09:15,697 --> 01:09:16,823
Or the shakes?

1084
01:09:21,995 --> 01:09:23,538
No, this is ridiculous.

1085
01:09:23,705 --> 01:09:27,709
What possible reason could I
have for strangling a playwright?

1086
01:09:27,876 --> 01:09:30,170
I haven't seen
anything he's done.

1087
01:09:30,337 --> 01:09:34,049
No, but Mervyn saw the woman who
visited Kopernick at the Savoy.

1088
01:09:35,008 --> 01:09:36,009
So?

1089
01:09:36,718 --> 01:09:37,719
Inspector...

1090
01:09:38,136 --> 01:09:40,639
have you spoken to Joyce lately?

1091
01:09:41,265 --> 01:09:42,390
Joyce?

1092
01:09:42,558 --> 01:09:43,559
Your wife.

1093
01:09:43,725 --> 01:09:44,725
Ex-wife.

1094
01:09:44,893 --> 01:09:47,020
Yes. I met her once
at a police social.

1095
01:09:47,229 --> 01:09:49,898
A plain girl.

1096
01:09:50,064 --> 01:09:51,066
Very homely.

1097
01:09:51,274 --> 01:09:53,527
What does Joyce have
to do with anything?

1098
01:09:53,694 --> 01:09:56,530
Her name was in Leo's
little black book, sir.

1099
01:09:56,989 --> 01:10:00,117
Oh, come on. You don't
seriously think that Leo and...

1100
01:10:00,284 --> 01:10:02,536
Didn't your wife
leave you for a Yank?

1101
01:10:02,953 --> 01:10:05,247
Leo was an American G.I.

1102
01:10:05,789 --> 01:10:08,500
Will you listen to yourselves?
You hear what you're sayin'?

1103
01:10:09,835 --> 01:10:10,836
Constable.

1104
01:10:16,508 --> 01:10:18,719
"They do it out of
revenge or rage...

1105
01:10:18,969 --> 01:10:20,721
"because they have
lost a loved one...

1106
01:10:20,888 --> 01:10:22,931
"and can't forgive or forget.

1107
01:10:23,473 --> 01:10:25,767
"So they just stew and fester...

1108
01:10:25,934 --> 01:10:29,605
"until it all comes out in a
sudden, frenzied act of violence."

1109
01:10:32,357 --> 01:10:34,151
You wrote that down.

1110
01:10:37,237 --> 01:10:39,406
That was a private conversation.

1111
01:10:40,657 --> 01:10:42,576
Well, I thought it
could be important, sir.

1112
01:10:44,161 --> 01:10:45,537
Unbelievable.

1113
01:10:48,207 --> 01:10:49,374
We found her.

1114
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:50,876
- Who?
- Joyce.

1115
01:10:51,043 --> 01:10:52,794
Joyce. Joyce is here?

1116
01:10:52,961 --> 01:10:53,961
Constable.

1117
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:13,857
That's not my wife.

1118
01:11:14,942 --> 01:11:15,942
I'm sorry?

1119
01:11:16,068 --> 01:11:17,569
I said that's not my wife.

1120
01:11:17,945 --> 01:11:19,738
But it is your ex-wife.

1121
01:11:20,447 --> 01:11:22,950
Never seen that woman
before in my life.

1122
01:11:25,077 --> 01:11:26,328
But your name is Joyce?

1123
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,540
Well, it's a common name.

1124
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:32,793
- 'Course it is.
- Yeah.

1125
01:11:34,545 --> 01:11:35,546
'Course it is.

1126
01:11:38,048 --> 01:11:40,384
Well, Inspector, in
that case, I believe...

1127
01:11:40,926 --> 01:11:42,511
you are owed an apology.

1128
01:11:45,806 --> 01:11:46,807
Constable.

1129
01:11:49,601 --> 01:11:50,894
Yes, sir. O' course.

1130
01:11:51,103 --> 01:11:53,063
I'm so sorry, sir.

1131
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:57,150
I just got the wrong end of the
stick, and I have no excuse. I just...

1132
01:11:57,317 --> 01:11:59,862
I jumped to conclusions
again. I'm so sorry.

1133
01:12:05,325 --> 01:12:08,245
Commissioner, why don't you
run along back to the office...

1134
01:12:08,412 --> 01:12:09,872
look over the
quarterly accounts.

1135
01:12:10,038 --> 01:12:11,999
Let me handle the
murder investigation.

1136
01:12:12,165 --> 01:12:13,333
Inspector.

1137
01:12:16,753 --> 01:12:17,754
Sorry.

1138
01:12:52,581 --> 01:12:53,957
It's Dickie and Sheila.

1139
01:12:54,208 --> 01:12:57,211
Hello, Woolf. Didn't
expect to see you here.

1140
01:13:01,924 --> 01:13:03,217
Perhaps, it is...

1141
01:13:03,383 --> 01:13:05,552
Miss Rams... bottom.

1142
01:13:06,053 --> 01:13:08,013
Get that...

1143
01:13:15,187 --> 01:13:19,566
If you have broken down, there is
a garage not 15 miles from here.

1144
01:13:19,858 --> 01:13:21,527
No, we're here for dinner.

1145
01:13:21,693 --> 01:13:23,237
I don't think so, sir.

1146
01:13:23,862 --> 01:13:26,156
This is Winterbrook House?

1147
01:13:26,573 --> 01:13:27,866
The Christie residence?

1148
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:29,701
It is.

1149
01:13:29,868 --> 01:13:30,868
We have an invitation.

1150
01:13:30,911 --> 01:13:31,954
We do, yes.

1151
01:13:33,956 --> 01:13:36,166
Richard Attenborough.
Friends call me "Dickie."

1152
01:13:44,007 --> 01:13:46,218
I do hope you
haven't traveled far.

1153
01:13:50,222 --> 01:13:52,140
Fellowes! Who is it?

1154
01:13:52,307 --> 01:13:54,893
No one, sir. Tinkers.

1155
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:58,981
What, in this unseasonable
blizzard? Come on, man. Open sesame.

1156
01:13:59,815 --> 01:14:01,655
Richard Attenborough.
Friends call me "Dickie."

1157
01:14:01,775 --> 01:14:03,777
Max Mallowan, eminent
archaeologist.

1158
01:14:03,944 --> 01:14:05,338
Good God, man,
you're frozen solid.

1159
01:14:05,362 --> 01:14:06,881
- It's cold. It's cold, yes.
- Come in.

1160
01:14:06,905 --> 01:14:08,532
- Hello, Sheila Sim.
- Hello.

1161
01:14:08,907 --> 01:14:10,242
- John Woolf.
- How do you do?

1162
01:14:10,492 --> 01:14:11,493
Ann Saville.

1163
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:13,328
We're friends of
Petula. Spencer.

1164
01:14:13,579 --> 01:14:15,289
Oh, yes. I know Choo.

1165
01:14:16,039 --> 01:14:18,542
We thought we'd been
invited for dinner.

1166
01:14:18,709 --> 01:14:20,627
Yes, we received this...

1167
01:14:21,253 --> 01:14:23,380
but apparently, not from you.

1168
01:14:23,547 --> 01:14:24,673
Extraordinary.

1169
01:14:25,507 --> 01:14:28,135
You know who's going
to love this? Agatha.

1170
01:14:28,302 --> 01:14:30,095
It's just like one
of her confections.

1171
01:14:30,262 --> 01:14:33,140
She's in the kitchen now trying
to figure out some new ending.

1172
01:14:34,016 --> 01:14:36,059
It helps to do the
dishes, apparently.

1173
01:14:40,063 --> 01:14:42,983
Hello. Who else didn't
we invite to dinner?

1174
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:44,401
Ah, it's Petula.

1175
01:14:44,568 --> 01:14:45,819
Why, so it is.

1176
01:14:46,695 --> 01:14:48,155
Come in out of the cold, Choo!

1177
01:14:48,322 --> 01:14:49,948
What on Earth have
you got there?

1178
01:14:51,074 --> 01:14:52,159
It's not Mother, is it?

1179
01:14:52,326 --> 01:14:53,660
'Fraid so.

1180
01:14:54,036 --> 01:14:55,037
Oh, God.

1181
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,682
Better make that eight for dinner,
Fellowes, and let Agatha know.

1182
01:14:57,706 --> 01:14:58,706
Yes, sir.

1183
01:14:58,832 --> 01:15:00,059
And get a shovel
to clear the path.

1184
01:15:00,083 --> 01:15:01,083
Yes, sir.

1185
01:15:01,168 --> 01:15:02,248
And do we have enough coal?

1186
01:15:02,336 --> 01:15:03,879
Yes, sir. Three bags full, sir.

1187
01:15:04,046 --> 01:15:05,923
- Hello, Maxie.
- Hello, darling.

1188
01:15:06,590 --> 01:15:08,467
Oh, it's a full house.

1189
01:15:08,926 --> 01:15:09,927
Yes.

1190
01:15:10,093 --> 01:15:11,093
Mother.

1191
01:15:11,136 --> 01:15:13,096
Come on in. Straight
through to the drawing room.

1192
01:15:13,263 --> 01:15:14,473
- Here.
- Now...

1193
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:17,893
I have a rather potent
Mesopotamian aperitif...

1194
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:19,895
that'll have you
thawed out in a jiffy.

1195
01:15:45,587 --> 01:15:48,090
I'm sorry again that you
had to find out like this.

1196
01:15:48,257 --> 01:15:50,592
Oh, I can't say it
came as a surprise.

1197
01:15:51,677 --> 01:15:53,428
Leo was a bad seed.

1198
01:15:54,388 --> 01:15:55,889
Always in trouble, he was.

1199
01:15:56,974 --> 01:15:58,851
He picked a fight the
night he took us out.

1200
01:15:59,268 --> 01:16:01,144
Mervyn Cocker-Norris
at the hotel.

1201
01:16:01,937 --> 01:16:03,772
No. At the pictures.

1202
01:16:13,448 --> 01:16:17,494
He turned on this tall fella who
came in after us and shouted...

1203
01:16:17,661 --> 01:16:19,580
"What are you following
me for, buddy?"

1204
01:16:20,330 --> 01:16:24,960
And... Did he know a good dentist, 'cause
he was about to lose a lot of teeth.

1205
01:16:27,838 --> 01:16:30,174
Right, who's ready for a top-up?

1206
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:31,175
No.

1207
01:16:31,341 --> 01:16:34,636
Where's the old girl? Not gonna
play the recluse card, is she?

1208
01:16:34,803 --> 01:16:36,972
Oh, no, no, no. She'll
be down soon enough.

1209
01:16:39,349 --> 01:16:40,767
That will be Fellowes.

1210
01:16:40,934 --> 01:16:42,436
The man's an oaf.

1211
01:16:46,899 --> 01:16:48,567
A tall fella, you say?

1212
01:16:49,902 --> 01:16:51,486
Had a funny accent.

1213
01:16:53,322 --> 01:16:54,323
Italian?

1214
01:16:54,489 --> 01:16:55,699
No, not that funny.

1215
01:16:55,866 --> 01:16:57,117
More like...

1216
01:16:59,077 --> 01:17:00,495
a village idiot.

1217
01:17:04,917 --> 01:17:07,044
I'm sorry, but you
have to get out.

1218
01:17:09,755 --> 01:17:11,673
No. Good heavens. No.

1219
01:17:22,309 --> 01:17:24,436
Scotland Yard, Sergeant
Bakewell speaking.

1220
01:17:24,603 --> 01:17:25,729
Yes, Stoppard here.

1221
01:17:31,151 --> 01:17:32,444
Police, stand back.

1222
01:17:32,778 --> 01:17:33,779
He keeps a key...

1223
01:17:34,696 --> 01:17:35,822
under the mat.

1224
01:17:40,452 --> 01:17:42,204
<i>Let me guess, Inspector.</i>

1225
01:17:42,371 --> 01:17:43,622
<i>You're after an address.</i>

1226
01:17:44,248 --> 01:17:45,249
How did you know that?

1227
01:17:45,415 --> 01:17:48,585
Constable Stalker, sir. She called
just now for the same information.

1228
01:17:49,837 --> 01:17:50,921
Stalker?

1229
01:17:59,888 --> 01:18:00,889
Agatha?

1230
01:18:01,098 --> 01:18:02,391
Gosh, is she all right?

1231
01:18:35,132 --> 01:18:37,259
Where's Agatha? What
have you done with her?

1232
01:18:45,058 --> 01:18:46,602
- It was the usher, sir.
- I know.

1233
01:18:46,768 --> 01:18:48,270
He was under our
noses all this time.

1234
01:18:48,437 --> 01:18:50,480
- Is he in?
- No, sir. But I found this.

1235
01:18:50,689 --> 01:18:53,418
- If we get going now, sir, we can...
- I can take it from here, Constable.

1236
01:18:53,442 --> 01:18:54,860
Oh, right. And me, sir?

1237
01:18:55,027 --> 01:18:56,236
Go back to the station.

1238
01:18:57,487 --> 01:18:58,530
Yes, sir.

1239
01:18:58,697 --> 01:18:59,698
Oh, and, Constable?

1240
01:18:59,865 --> 01:19:00,866
Yes, sir?

1241
01:19:01,366 --> 01:19:03,118
Make a start on the paperwork.

1242
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,121
Yes, sir.

1243
01:19:19,384 --> 01:19:22,054
Is it me, or does he
look awfully familiar?

1244
01:19:22,596 --> 01:19:25,807
It's Dennis. He's an usher
from the Ambassadors.

1245
01:19:26,683 --> 01:19:28,227
Oh, Dennis!

1246
01:19:28,393 --> 01:19:29,686
So nice to see you.

1247
01:19:29,853 --> 01:19:32,606
This is a strange coincidence.
What are you doing here?

1248
01:19:33,607 --> 01:19:34,775
Well, I invited you.

1249
01:19:35,692 --> 01:19:36,693
Oh, my God.

1250
01:19:37,528 --> 01:19:39,154
You killed Leo and Mervyn!

1251
01:19:39,905 --> 01:19:40,906
I did.

1252
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:43,867
I wanted to stop the
film and the play.

1253
01:19:43,951 --> 01:19:45,410
What film? What play?

1254
01:19:45,494 --> 01:19:46,494
<i>The Mousetrap!</i>

1255
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:48,163
Now, look here, Dennis.

1256
01:19:48,330 --> 01:19:50,999
We all have strong
opinions on the theater.

1257
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:54,461
In a sense, that's what it's
there for, to provoke emotion.

1258
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:57,464
And I appreciate you don't
care for <i>The Mousetrap.</i>

1259
01:19:57,714 --> 01:20:00,884
I'll be the first to admit
it's not exactly <i>Hamlet.</i>

1260
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:03,470
But you must see...

1261
01:20:04,012 --> 01:20:05,848
that this is a bit
of an overreaction.

1262
01:20:06,014 --> 01:20:07,724
That's not what this is.

1263
01:20:07,891 --> 01:20:10,310
Then, what is this?

1264
01:20:10,769 --> 01:20:13,188
It's not your story to
tell, is it? It's mine.

1265
01:20:13,355 --> 01:20:14,606
Oh, I might have known.

1266
01:20:14,773 --> 01:20:18,443
A disgruntled writer. Don't
tell me, you had the idea first?

1267
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:20,737
No. It happened to me.

1268
01:20:20,904 --> 01:20:23,665
I'm sorry, I am completely lost. I
don't have a theatrical background.

1269
01:20:23,991 --> 01:20:26,368
You're not Dennis
Corrigan, are you?

1270
01:20:30,539 --> 01:20:32,082
Oh, you poor boy.

1271
01:20:32,875 --> 01:20:33,875
How do you mean?

1272
01:20:33,959 --> 01:20:36,295
He lost his brother
in real life.

1273
01:20:36,503 --> 01:20:38,338
Dreadful business, it was.

1274
01:20:38,505 --> 01:20:40,716
It was years ago, now.
I told you about it.

1275
01:20:40,883 --> 01:20:43,010
It was the case <i>The
Mousetrap</i> was based on.

1276
01:20:43,177 --> 01:20:45,470
Inspired by,
Mother. And loosely.

1277
01:20:46,096 --> 01:20:47,764
Oh, but you're an usher.

1278
01:20:47,931 --> 01:20:50,058
You had to watch that
play night after night.

1279
01:20:50,601 --> 01:20:52,144
It must've been torture.

1280
01:20:53,228 --> 01:20:54,855
I thought it would help.

1281
01:20:55,939 --> 01:20:58,192
<i>He was only six when
he died, my brother.</i>

1282
01:20:58,358 --> 01:21:00,694
<i>The Mousetrap</i> is actually
based on a real-life case.

1283
01:21:00,861 --> 01:21:04,907
<i>Neglected and left for dead by the people
who were supposed to look after us.</i>

1284
01:21:06,033 --> 01:21:09,411
<i>It sold a lot of newspapers,
but no one cared about us.</i>

1285
01:21:11,663 --> 01:21:14,124
<i>I thought the play
would be different.</i>

1286
01:21:14,291 --> 01:21:16,543
<i>A famous writer was
going to tell our story.</i>

1287
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:20,130
Two brothers who put their faith
in the British social services.

1288
01:21:20,297 --> 01:21:23,091
<i>But when I saw what Agatha
Christie had done...</i>

1289
01:21:23,258 --> 01:21:27,012
<i>used our pain and suffering as a
motive for a deranged killer...</i>

1290
01:21:28,055 --> 01:21:30,849
<i>my brother's death reduced
to a cheap sideshow...</i>

1291
01:21:31,016 --> 01:21:32,476
There's been a murder?

1292
01:21:32,643 --> 01:21:35,771
<i>I knew he wouldn't be able to rest
in peace until the play ended.</i>

1293
01:21:36,438 --> 01:21:38,857
But it didn't.

1294
01:21:39,024 --> 01:21:42,027
It just went on, and on, and on.

1295
01:21:42,194 --> 01:21:44,446
<i>The Mousetrap</i> is 100, not out.

1296
01:21:44,613 --> 01:21:47,574
<i>When I heard about the film
adaptation, I just snapped.</i>

1297
01:21:48,492 --> 01:21:51,119
Without me, there is no
movie. You understand?

1298
01:21:51,286 --> 01:21:52,329
You got a problem, buddy?

1299
01:21:52,496 --> 01:21:54,289
<i>I killed the director
to stop the film...</i>

1300
01:21:55,290 --> 01:21:58,377
<i>and thought a corpse on the stage
would put an end to the play.</i>

1301
01:22:00,295 --> 01:22:02,256
<i>But they didn't even
close the theater.</i>

1302
01:22:02,422 --> 01:22:05,302
Do you think you might be finished in
time for curtain up tomorrow night?

1303
01:22:05,425 --> 01:22:08,428
<i>And Mervyn's new ideas for the
film made me sick to my stomach.</i>

1304
01:22:08,971 --> 01:22:12,975
I'll take the bare bones of the story,
a rather mundane tale of child abuse...

1305
01:22:13,141 --> 01:22:14,518
and make it my own.

1306
01:22:14,893 --> 01:22:16,103
<i>He left me no choice.</i>

1307
01:22:18,063 --> 01:22:19,106
You startled me.

1308
01:22:19,273 --> 01:22:20,691
<i>I had to kill him, too.</i>

1309
01:22:23,443 --> 01:22:25,279
<i>I thought that would
be the end of it.</i>

1310
01:22:25,863 --> 01:22:28,282
But you all just carried on
like nothing had happened.

1311
01:22:29,908 --> 01:22:31,368
Shame on you.

1312
01:22:33,161 --> 01:22:36,623
Well, maybe you'll take notice if
I kill Agatha Christie herself.

1313
01:22:40,836 --> 01:22:42,313
Oh, I think she's
tryin' to say something.

1314
01:22:42,337 --> 01:22:44,673
Oh, for God's sake, let her
out. I'll stop the film.

1315
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:46,717
And the play. This is barbaric.

1316
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:48,051
Fine.

1317
01:22:55,434 --> 01:22:56,435
Edana?

1318
01:22:57,352 --> 01:22:59,396
Darling, what are
you doing here?

1319
01:22:59,563 --> 01:23:03,317
I followed you. I suppose I
was going to make a scene.

1320
01:23:03,525 --> 01:23:04,693
Hello, Ann.

1321
01:23:05,444 --> 01:23:08,822
Then this beanpole assaulted
me, and I woke up in a carpet.

1322
01:23:08,989 --> 01:23:11,617
If you're not Agatha Christie,
where the hell is she?

1323
01:23:11,783 --> 01:23:13,410
Good God, man. You
mean you don't know?

1324
01:23:13,577 --> 01:23:16,163
What kind of a bumbling,
half-witted psychopath are you?

1325
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:18,498
Will you be quiet! Please!

1326
01:23:18,957 --> 01:23:20,501
Let me think!

1327
01:23:20,667 --> 01:23:21,667
Yes, of course!

1328
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:24,713
Of course. Why don't you
come in and sit down, Dennis?

1329
01:23:25,547 --> 01:23:27,132
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1330
01:23:27,299 --> 01:23:29,676
Have a little
moment to yourself.

1331
01:24:39,913 --> 01:24:40,914
What?

1332
01:25:03,145 --> 01:25:04,146
Well...

1333
01:25:05,564 --> 01:25:07,858
I, for one, believe that...

1334
01:25:08,650 --> 01:25:10,694
Dennis here is owed an apology.

1335
01:25:11,486 --> 01:25:14,323
- Yes.
- He's right, of course.

1336
01:25:14,489 --> 01:25:15,699
The truth is the truth.

1337
01:25:15,866 --> 01:25:18,911
It is not to be manipulated
or played with...

1338
01:25:19,077 --> 01:25:20,621
and certainly not
for entertainment.

1339
01:25:20,787 --> 01:25:22,206
- No, no.
- No, no.

1340
01:25:22,372 --> 01:25:25,334
- Art is supposed to reveal the truth...
- Yes.

1341
01:25:25,501 --> 01:25:27,085
- Yeah.
- Not pervert it.

1342
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:31,840
How would Agatha Christie like it if
someone took one of her stories...

1343
01:25:32,007 --> 01:25:36,303
and twisted it and corrupted
it just for the hell of it?

1344
01:25:37,262 --> 01:25:38,680
She wouldn't.

1345
01:25:38,847 --> 01:25:42,809
I think that we should all feel
thoroughly ashamed of ourselves.

1346
01:25:42,976 --> 01:25:44,228
Oh, here we are.

1347
01:25:44,394 --> 01:25:45,394
Tea for everyone.

1348
01:25:45,437 --> 01:25:46,522
There you are, my dear.

1349
01:25:46,730 --> 01:25:48,398
Sorry to have kept you.

1350
01:25:48,565 --> 01:25:50,609
No, no, please don't get
up, not on my account.

1351
01:25:51,318 --> 01:25:52,318
There, there.

1352
01:25:52,402 --> 01:25:54,613
- No, no, no, it's fine.
- Be careful.

1353
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:58,242
Just as it was. I
think it was that way.

1354
01:25:58,408 --> 01:26:01,537
It is so nice to see you again,
Agatha, in spite of the circumstances.

1355
01:26:01,703 --> 01:26:04,331
No, no, no, not that one.
No, that's for Dennis.

1356
01:26:08,168 --> 01:26:09,545
It is Dennis, isn't it?

1357
01:26:10,963 --> 01:26:11,964
There we are.

1358
01:26:12,506 --> 01:26:14,341
I put an extra lump in.

1359
01:26:15,217 --> 01:26:16,468
Thank you.

1360
01:26:16,635 --> 01:26:18,303
Everyone else, help themselves.

1361
01:26:20,556 --> 01:26:22,391
Now, Dennis.

1362
01:26:22,558 --> 01:26:25,435
How can I help? Why don't we
sit here and drink our tea...

1363
01:26:25,602 --> 01:26:28,188
and discuss the matter
like civilized people?

1364
01:26:30,190 --> 01:26:32,067
I want you to stop
<i>The Mousetrap.</i>

1365
01:26:32,234 --> 01:26:34,987
Oh, I am sorry, but
that I cannot do. No.

1366
01:26:35,445 --> 01:26:38,365
I'm afraid it goes against
everything I hold dear in life.

1367
01:26:38,991 --> 01:26:41,201
Yes. I'm a writer, you see.

1368
01:26:41,368 --> 01:26:44,538
I can't be told what to
write or what not to write.

1369
01:26:44,705 --> 01:26:47,583
It would be a denial
of one's freedom.

1370
01:26:48,709 --> 01:26:52,546
Do you see, Dennis? Do drink up.

1371
01:27:18,030 --> 01:27:19,281
Good God, Fellowes.

1372
01:27:20,949 --> 01:27:22,159
Get up. Get up.

1373
01:27:22,367 --> 01:27:23,911
Now, look here, young man, I...

1374
01:27:24,912 --> 01:27:25,912
Max!

1375
01:27:47,059 --> 01:27:48,101
- Yes, good idea...
- Yes.

1376
01:27:48,727 --> 01:27:50,854
Oh, my God. Now what's happened?

1377
01:28:09,623 --> 01:28:10,624
Dennis.

1378
01:28:12,793 --> 01:28:15,128
Put the popular author
down, please, Dennis.

1379
01:28:15,671 --> 01:28:16,964
No.

1380
01:28:21,093 --> 01:28:23,512
Sheila, darling,
now's hardly the time.

1381
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:25,597
Dickie, I need a light.

1382
01:28:25,764 --> 01:28:27,099
But you don't smoke.

1383
01:28:27,891 --> 01:28:29,226
Dickie.

1384
01:29:04,511 --> 01:29:05,511
Look out!

1385
01:29:07,014 --> 01:29:08,015
No, Dennis!

1386
01:29:08,932 --> 01:29:10,475
Don't do it, please!

1387
01:29:16,523 --> 01:29:17,566
Darling!

1388
01:29:19,276 --> 01:29:22,905
It's all right. He's
dead. It's over.

1389
01:29:26,491 --> 01:29:27,492
Sir...

1390
01:29:28,827 --> 01:29:29,953
I'm bleedin'.

1391
01:29:33,165 --> 01:29:36,877
Hang in there, Constable.
Sergeant's exam's in a month.

1392
01:29:37,544 --> 01:29:39,624
It's funny, sir. I actually...
I don't feel anything.

1393
01:29:39,755 --> 01:29:41,155
I think it mighta
just been a nick.

1394
01:29:41,256 --> 01:29:43,675
Yeah. Just the nick
of time, I'd say.

1395
01:29:44,051 --> 01:29:45,052
Very good.

1396
01:29:46,261 --> 01:29:47,387
I'm sorry, Constable.

1397
01:29:48,472 --> 01:29:52,976
I haven't been altogether honest or open
or loyal or fair to you as a partner.

1398
01:29:53,477 --> 01:29:56,855
Truth be told, I haven't been
a partner at all, you know.

1399
01:29:57,689 --> 01:29:58,833
Sir, you don't have to say that.

1400
01:29:58,857 --> 01:30:00,692
No, I want you to know...

1401
01:30:00,859 --> 01:30:02,110
I do trust you.

1402
01:30:02,277 --> 01:30:04,988
Thank you, sir. That
does mean a lot.

1403
01:30:05,155 --> 01:30:08,784
But when I say that I can't feel
anything, I think what I mean is that...

1404
01:30:09,618 --> 01:30:11,954
I don't think the
bullet hit me, sir.

1405
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:13,163
What do you mean?

1406
01:30:14,206 --> 01:30:15,415
Did you...

1407
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:18,710
- Oh, I see.
- Oh, no. Yeah.

1408
01:30:18,877 --> 01:30:20,754
Oh. Well, you're right
again, Constable.

1409
01:30:20,921 --> 01:30:21,922
Are you all right, sir?

1410
01:30:22,089 --> 01:30:23,441
I think you better
call an ambulance.

1411
01:30:23,465 --> 01:30:24,466
Yep.

1412
01:30:25,968 --> 01:30:27,970
Yes, I don't feel so good.

1413
01:30:29,847 --> 01:30:31,640
A shoot-out and a big explosion.

1414
01:30:32,266 --> 01:30:35,310
Perhaps it's for the best that
Mervyn wasn't alive to see it.

1415
01:30:36,436 --> 01:30:37,437
Quite.

1416
01:31:08,385 --> 01:31:11,138
It's okay, everyone, I'm fine.

1417
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:20,397
<i>Now that's what I call
a Leo Kopernick ending.</i>

1418
01:31:22,274 --> 01:31:24,693
<i>But before we go
our separate ways...</i>

1419
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:28,655
<i>you'll be wanting to know what
became of the heroes of this tale.</i>

1420
01:31:31,491 --> 01:31:37,497
<i>Constable Stalker, as advertised, sat her
sergeant's exams in the spring of 1953.</i>

1421
01:31:40,334 --> 01:31:42,169
<i>She aced them.</i>

1422
01:31:44,129 --> 01:31:47,049
Detective Inspector
George Stoppard.

1423
01:31:47,508 --> 01:31:53,180
<i>Inspector Stoppard was awarded the
King's Police and Fire Services Medal.</i>

1424
01:31:54,348 --> 01:31:57,100
<i>Harrold Scott
received a Knighthood.</i>

1425
01:32:00,854 --> 01:32:06,652
<i>The play, if you can believe it, is
still going strong in London's West End.</i>

1426
01:32:08,028 --> 01:32:11,907
<i>Over 10 million people have
sat through</i> The Mousetrap.

1427
01:32:12,115 --> 01:32:15,452
Two brothers who put their faith
in the British social services.

1428
01:32:16,662 --> 01:32:19,998
A sorry tale of abuse
that ended in tragedy.

1429
01:32:22,501 --> 01:32:24,503
Well, now that you've
seen our film...

1430
01:32:24,753 --> 01:32:27,297
you are an accomplice to murder.

1431
01:32:27,464 --> 01:32:30,342
And so we ask you to remember that
it is very much in your interest...

1432
01:32:30,509 --> 01:32:32,219
not to tell a soul
outside of this...

1433
01:32:32,886 --> 01:32:34,179
Sir. Sorry.

1434
01:32:34,346 --> 01:32:36,807
But I've missed the endin' once.

1435
01:32:36,974 --> 01:32:38,350
I don't wanna miss it again.

1436
01:32:38,517 --> 01:32:41,061
No, of course not.
I'm sorry. Sorry.
