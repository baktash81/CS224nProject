the Superhero Relocation Program.

from responsibility for past actions,

175

to never again resume hero work.

- Look, I know it's you!

Now, go on. Your new suit will be
finished before your next assignment.

663
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,699
You know I'm retired from hero work.

664
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:48,036
As am I, Robert.
Yet, here we are.

665
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:52,499
E, I only need a patch job.
For sentimental reasons.

666
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:56,670
(SIGHS) Fine.
I will also fix the hobo suit.

667
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:01,341
- You're the best of the best, E.
- Yes, I know, darling. I know.

BOB: Don't answer it, honey, I got it!

670
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:19,484
- Hello?
- We have a new assignment for you.

671
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,408

BOB: I'll leave tomorrow morning.

672

- Goodbye.

673
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,790
Who was that, honey? The, uh, office?

674
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,793
Another conference.
Short notice, but, you know,

675
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,712
duty calls. (NERVOUS LAUGH)

676
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,555
- HELEN: Bob?
- Yeah, what's up, honey?

677
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,143
- Ha... Have a great trip.
- Thanks, sweetie.

678
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,812
- I'll call you when I get there.
- I love you.

679
00:46:55,896 --> 00:47:00,066
- So much.
- I love you, too.

SHIP'S COMPUTER:
This is your automated Captain.

681
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:18,418
Would you care for more mimosa?

682
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,671
- BOB: Don't mind if I do. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

683
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:27,969
Currently 78 degrees in Nomanisan.
Perfect weather for flying.

684
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:37,687
Please fasten your seat belt.
We're beginning our descent.

685
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:05,715

Nice suit.

686
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,091
Thanks.

687
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:09,928
Nice to be back, Mirage.

688
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:39,457
You'll be briefed on your assignment
in the conference room at 2:00.

689
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:42,961
- D Wing, room A-113.
- 2:00. Got it.

690
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,546
See you there.

691
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,496
(GASPS) Edna.

692
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,457
- I'd like to speak to Edna, please.
- E: This is Edna.

693
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:24,252
- E? This is Helen.
- Helen who?

694
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:27,589
Helen Parr? You know...

695
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:29,799
Elastigirl?

696
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:34,137
Darling! It's been such a long time
after all these years! So long!

697
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,972
(STAMMERING) It's been a while.

698
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,515
There's only one person
Bob would trust

699
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,309
to patch his supersuit. That's you.

700
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,352
Yes, yes, yes. Marvelous, isn't it?

701
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:44,606
Much better than those
horrible pajamas he used to wear.

702
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,191
They are finished.
When are you coming to see?

703
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:49,360
- HELEN: I'm calling about...
- Don't make me beg.

704
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:50,945
- I won't do it, you know.
- Beg?

705
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:53,656
No, I'm calling about suit.

706
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:56,492
(STAMMERING) Bob's suit!
I'm calling about Bob's suit.

707
00:49:56,577 --> 00:50:00,371
You come in one hour, darling.
I insist, okay? Okay. Goodbye.

708
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:14,886
Hmm.

709
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:20,808
(CREAKING)

710
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,112
SYNDROME: It's bigger!

711
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:36,491
It's badder!

712
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:43,081
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's too much for Mr. Incredible!

713
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:46,876
It's finally ready.

714
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:51,339
You know, I went through quite a few
supers to get it worthy to fight you,

715
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:54,884
but, man, it wasn't good enough!

716
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:58,972
After you trashed the last one, I had
to make some major modifications.

717
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:02,141
Sure it was difficult, but you are worth it.

718
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:06,396
I mean, after all, I am your biggest fan.

719
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:10,984
- Buddy?
- My name is not Buddy!

720
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,820
And it's not IncrediBoy either!

721
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:17,365
That ship has sailed.
All I wanted was to help you.

722
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:20,702
I only wanted to help!
And what did you say to me?

723
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:23,454
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

724
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:27,291
SYNDROME: It tore me apart.
But I learned an important lesson.

725
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:29,335
You can't count on anyone.

726
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,337
Especially your heroes.

727
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:34,716
I was wrong to treat you that way.
I'm sorry.

728
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,219
See? Now you respect me,
because I'm a threat.

729
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,762
That's the way it works.

730
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:42,598
There's a lot of people,
whole countries who want respect.

731
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:45,268
And they will pay
through the nose to get it.

732
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:47,937
How do you think I got rich?
I invented weapons.

733
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:52,066
Now I have a weapon only I can defeat.
And when I unleash it, I'll get...

734
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,946
(LAUGHING) You sly dog!
You got me monologuing.

735
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:58,865
I can't believe it.

736
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:06,080
It's cool, huh? Zero-point energy.
I save the best inventions for myself.

737
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,708
Am I good enough now?

738
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,794
Who's super now?

739
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:14,380
I'm Syndrome! Your nemesis and...

740
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,633
Oh, brilliant!

741
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:24,557

742
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:38,071

745
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,621
BOB: Kronos?

746
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:58,651
SCANNER: Life reading negative.
Mr. Incredible terminated.

747
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:06,367
E: This project has completely
confiscated my life, darling.

748
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:10,705
Consumed me as only hero work can.
My best work, I must admit.

749
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:15,084
Simple, elegant, yet bold. You will die.

750
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:17,003
- E, I just...
- I did Robert's suit,

751
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:20,631
and it turned out so beautiful,
I had to continue.

752
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:24,510
It's great to see you, but I have
no idea what you're talking about.

753
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,888
- I just...
- Yes, words are useless.

754
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:29,891
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Too much of it, darling. Too much!

755
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,059
That is why I show you my work.

756
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,853
That is why you are here.

757
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:42,695
Edna Mode.

758
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,448
And guest.

759
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,091
Come. Sit.

760
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:10,806
- Cream and sugar?
- Thanks.

761
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,643
- I started with the baby.
- Started?

762
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:17,730
E: Shh! Darling! I cut it a little
roomy for the free movement.

763
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:20,733
The fabric is comfortable
for sensitive skin,

764
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:25,738
E: And can also withstand
a temperature of over 1000 degrees.

765
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,909
Completely bulletproof.

766
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,872
And machine washable, darling.
That's a new feature.

767
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:37,875
What on earth do you think
the baby will be doing?

768
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:42,088
Well, I'm sure I don't know, darling.
Luck favors the prepared.

769
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:45,341
I didn't know the baby's powers,
so I covered the basics.

770
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,969
- Jack-Jack doesn't have any powers.
- No?

771
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,845
Well, he'll look fabulous anyway.

772
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:55,893
Your boy's suit I designed
to withstand enormous friction

773
00:55:55,978 --> 00:55:59,563
without heating up or wearing out.
A useful feature.

774
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,984
Your daughter's suit was tricky.

775
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:08,447
I finally created a sturdy material that
will disappear completely as she does.

776
00:56:11,994 --> 00:56:16,372
Your suit can stretch as far as you can,
without injuring yourself,

777
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,499
and still retain its shape.

778
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:21,544
Virtually indestructible,

779
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:25,298
yet it breathes like Egyptian cotton.

780
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:28,968
As an extra feature,
each suit contains a homing device,

781
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:33,306
giving you the precise global location
of the wearer at the touch of a button.

782
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:37,435
Well, darling? What do you think?

783
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:42,064
What do I think? Bob is retired!
I'm retired!

784
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:43,649
Our family is underground.

785
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:46,902
You helped my husband resume
secret hero work behind my back?

786
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:49,530
Well, I assumed you knew, darling.

787
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:52,491
Why would he keep secrets from you?

788
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:55,202
He wouldn't. Didn't. Doesn't.

789
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:59,206
Men at Robert's age are often unstable.

790
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,752
- Prone to weakness.
- What are you saying?

791
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,379
Do you know where he is?

792
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:08,382
- Of course.
- Do you know where he is?

I was wondering if you could give me
the number of the hotel he's staying at?

803

- The number I have is no good.
- Mr. Parr no longer works here.

804

What do you mean? He's on
a business trip. A company retreat.

that he is Mr. Incredible,

and you will remind him who you are!

01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:48,490
Nothing. Just a little trouble with Daddy.

828
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:52,870
You mean Dad's in trouble,
or Dad is the trouble?

829
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:56,790
I mean either he's in trouble,
or he's going to be.

830
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:05,966
What's that?
Where'd you get that, Mom?

831
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:08,177
You made a cool outfit?
Hey, are those for us?

832
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:09,678
We all get cool outfits?

833
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:12,764
Dash!
You come back here this moment!

834
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:13,891
(PHONE RINGS)

835
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:17,686
Hey, Snug. Thanks for getting back.

836
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:20,564
I know this is short notice,
but I was hoping that I could...

837
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:23,609
- What are these?
- Look, I'm The Dash!

838
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:26,445
- The Dash likes.
- HELEN: Just a second.

839
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:30,699
- Take that off before somebody sees.
- You're packing one just like it.

840
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:33,577
- Are you hiding something?
- Please. I'm on the phone...

841
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:35,871
- Dash!
- This is yours. It's specially made.

842
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:39,291
- What's going on?
- You're not coming! I gotta pack!

843
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:43,837
What makes you think it's special?

844
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:46,673
I don't know. Why'd Mom try to hide it?

845
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:58,602
Snug, I'm calling in a solid you owe me.

846
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:02,314
- (OVER PHONE) What do you need?
- A jet. What do you got that's fast?

847
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:04,483
Let me think.

848
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:16,286
Island approach.
India Golf niner-niner checking in.

849
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:18,080
VFR on top. Over.

850

(RADIO STATIC)

851
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:23,794
Island tower,
this is India Golf niner-niner

852
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:26,213
requesting vectors to the initial.

(RADIO STATIC)

854
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:39,142
Easy, Helen. Easy. Easy, girl.

855
01:05:39,227 --> 01:05:43,480
You're overreacting. Everything's fine.
They're just all getting coffee.

856
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:48,610
At the same time. Yeah.

857
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:07,379
You, sir, truly are "Mr. Incredible."
I was right to idolize you.

858
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:10,299
I always knew you were tough,
but tricking the probe

859
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:14,344
by hiding under the bones
of another super? Oh, man!

860
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:16,847
I'm still geeking out about it!

861
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:18,098
(SIGHS)

862
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:21,685
And then you had
to just go and ruin the ride.

863
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:26,690
I mean, Mr. Incredible calling for help?
(MOCKING) "Help me, help me."

864
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:29,234
Lame, lame, lame.

865
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:30,736
All right, who did you contact?

866
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,655
Contact? What are you talking about?

867
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,576
(GROANING)

868
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:41,830
I am referring to last night
at 23:07 hours

869
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:45,042
while you were snooping around.
You sent out a homing signal.

870
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:48,086
I didn't know about the homing device.

871
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:56,637
And now a government plane
is requesting permission to land here.

872
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:57,679
Who did you contact?

873
01:06:57,764 --> 01:06:59,848
I didn't send for a plane.

874
01:06:59,932 --> 01:07:01,850
Play the transmission.

875
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:06,480
- HELEN: India Golf checking in.
- Helen!

876
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:09,650
So you do know these people.

877
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:12,861
Well, then,
I'll send them a little greeting.

878
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:17,366
- VIOLET: Ow!
- Violet!

879
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:18,909
It's not my fault.

880
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:21,036
Dash ran away,
I knew I'd get blamed for it.

881
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,954
That's not true!

882
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,415
You said, "Something's up with Mom.
We have to find out what."

883
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:29,378
...and it's not my fault!
- Hundred percent all-yours idea!

884
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:32,297
Wait a minute.
You left Jack-Jack alone?

885
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:35,509
- Of course we got a sitter.
- We got someone, Mom.

886
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:37,886
- We wouldn't do that.
- Thanks a lot!

887
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:40,764
All right, well, who'd you get?

888
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:43,225
You don't have to worry
about one thing.

889
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:46,603
I've got baby-sitting wired.
I've taken courses, learned CPR,

890
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:50,273
- excellent marks and certificates.
- Kari.

891
01:07:50,358 --> 01:07:52,567
I brought Mozart to play while he sleeps

892
01:07:52,652 --> 01:07:55,529
because leading experts say
Mozart makes babies smarter.

893
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:56,780
- Kari...
- The beauty is

894
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:59,574
they don't have to listen
'cause they're asleep!

895
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:01,743
I wish my parents played Mozart

896
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:04,830
because half the time I don't know
what anyone's talking about.

897
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:08,542
Kari, I really don't feel
comfortable with this.

898
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:11,545
I'll pay you for your trouble,
but I'd rather call a service.

899
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:13,588
There's really no need, Mrs. Parr.

900
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:16,383
I can totally handle anything
this baby can dish out.

901
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:19,219
(COOING) Can't I, little baby?
I can handle it.

- Friendlies...
- No!

907
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,643
Call off the missiles. I'll do anything.

908
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:12,063
Too late. Fifteen years too late.

909

Vi! Put a force field around the plane.

912
01:09:22,033 --> 01:09:23,783
You said not to use our powers.

- No!

- Oh, my God! Whose idea was this?
- What are we gonna do?

We're dead! We're dead!

- It blew up!
- We survived but we're dead!

Both of you will get a grip.

I will ground you for a month!

you prefer to "work alone."

I'll crush her.

Well, go ahead.

- Do you expect us to swim there?

we're not doing so hot either.

Put these on. Your identity
is your most valuable possession.

Protect it.

use your powers.

Well, these guys
are not like those guys.

They won't exercise restraint
because you're children.

Behold the Underminer!

1331
01:47:14,678 --> 01:47:17,138
UNDERMINER:
I am always beneath you,

1332
01:47:17,222 --> 01:47:20,183
but nothing is beneath me!

1333
01:47:20,601 --> 01:47:26,230
UNDERMINER: I hereby declare war
on peace and happiness!

1334
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:49,378
Soon all will tremble before me!
