"Get me a doctor now."

we should wait until we're quorate.

then we got a good doctor,

then we didn't, but he won't know.

You want factionalism?

521
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,597
What about those two, fucking
Abbott and Costello over there?

522
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:06,238
Christ.

523
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,597
When I piss, I try to make
eye contact with an officer.

524
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:10,839
Ruins their day.

525
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,720
When I piss, I try to piss
on an officer. Also ruins their day.

526
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:17,918
We should keep an eye
on Kaganovich.

527
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,317
Yeah, Khrushchev too,
his talking goat.

528
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:23,757
Khrushchev. I spend my life
making people talk.

529
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:26,279
I can't shut that gabbling idiot up.

530
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:30,678
We need to assert our authority,
increase security in Moscow.

531
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,638
We should get
Stalin's children here.

532
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,998
Vasily will be lying face down
in a ditch full of vodka.

533
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,638
But Svetlana...
The people love her.

534
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,998
I'm gonna get her in.
Comrade ministers!

535
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,077
Svetlana is here!
I'm here. I'm over here!

536
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:47,277
Svetlana!
Svetlana!

537
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,077
Shit. The race has started.

538
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:52,718
All right, we need to start putting
together a plan. We need change.

539
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,998
Put a halt to the arrests,
prison releases,

540
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,517
maybe even reform the Church.

541
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:58,638
How can you run and plot
at the same time?

542
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,918
Hello! Svetlana!

543
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,638
They're trying to cut you off.
Where?

544
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,398
It's obvious. Svetlana!

545
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,918
Svetlana!
Svetlana!

546
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,077
Oh, my darling.
Where is he?

547
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:09,317
Where's my father? I would like...
Oh, my dear.

548
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:12,238
I'm so sorry.
I would like to see him.

549
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,357
Yes, of course.
Where is he?

550
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:16,597
(EVERYONE TALKING)
We'll take you inside. He's in bed.

551
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:18,837
God Almighty!
Look at that herb garden.

552
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:20,037
Does nobody tend it any more?

553
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:22,517
Do people no longer
eat herbs any more?

554
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:24,077
Do they only eat weeds?

555
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:26,277
Come on, we'll take you to see him.
Where is Vasily?

556
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:28,277
I will get your brother here.
Most helpful.

557
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,238
All right.
She wants Vasily.

558
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,837
If Vasily is coming, granted,
we should probably have tea and buns.

559
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:36,119
We'll get some buns and some tea.
Soak up the vodka.

560
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,478
What?

561
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,077
I saw you and Big Boy
out in the woods earlier.

562
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:45,079
Yeah.
There's bears in there.

563
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,198
You'd better watch your step, son.

564
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,559
Well, there's bears in here too.
Hm?

565
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,878
Come on, play! Play better!

566
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,277
Urgh!

567
00:32:58,279 --> 00:32:59,839
Oh, Jesus.

568
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,837
When we play Hungary,
are we allowed to use guns?

569
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:05,198
These are the best
I could find since the plane crash.

570
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,438
What plane crash?
There was never a plane crash.

571
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,037
Was there a plane crash?
Soviet planes do not crash.

572
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:12,440
And Stalin's son
does not fuck up.

573
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,878
Christ!

574
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,478
We have Bobrov.
He wasn't on the plane.

575
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,519
What plane?

576
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,079
Bobrov!

577
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,000
Go on. Hit it.
No!

578
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:26,517
He's terrified, practically leaving
a trail of yellow ice!

579
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:29,357
You're the coach. Coach them so
they're as good as the dead team was.

580
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:32,317
Or I'll have you killed, okay?
Apologies. And agreed.

581
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:34,119
Or I'll just do it myself.

582
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,320
Come on! Play on!

583
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,198
Play through! Ignore me!

584
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,600
Get it. Give it. Hit it.

585
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,238
Vasily.

586
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,678
Play better, you clattering fannies!

587
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,998
Come.

588
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,878
Oh, fuck!
Do they know about the crash?

589
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,517
Give me a drink. I've got time
for a drink. Give me the flask.

590
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,559
(OFFICER SOFTLY)
No, no.

591
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,837
You are to come
to your father's dacha.

592
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,277
The plane should never have taken off.

593
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:02,357
Do you suppose
that just because I am who I am

594
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:03,998
that I can predict an ice storm?

595
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,837
Ice storm? Are you saying something's
happened to our national team?

596
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:09,077
Nothing's happened.
What the fuck are you doing?

597
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:11,517
My father will have you saddled
and ridden to Siberia,

598
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:13,079
you rude fucking pies.

599
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,398
KHRUSHCHEV: These are good doctors,
my dear. They're the best.

600
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,200
They look like mental patients.

601
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:22,279
Are they going to sing for us?
Why are they standing in a line?

602
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,400
Let's have it.

603
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,998
Following a group assessment
of Comrade Stalin,

604
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,517
we've arrived
at the unanimous conclusion,

605
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:41,237
based on a collective finding...

606
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,679
Please put him out of his misery.

607
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,597
Comrade Stalin has had
a cerebral haemorrhage.

608
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:48,677
The right side of his body
is paralyzed.

609
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,759
SVETLANA: Oh, God.

610
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:53,318
(SIGHS)
What is the chance of recovery?

611
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,720
It is hard to say.

612
00:34:57,239 --> 00:35:01,719
Relax. I'm not gonna kiss you.
Will he recover, yes or no?

613
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,358
(WHISPERS)
No.

614
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,720
No?
No.

615
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,000
It's over.

616
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,398
It's over!

617
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,838
I want a second opinion.
I don't trust these creatures to...

618
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,597
I mean, how old are you?
I'm 29.

619
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:22,438
That's a lie. How old are you?

620
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,599
You look dead.

621
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:27,077
I know people in Stalingrad.
I know people in Moscow.

622
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:31,517
No, no, no. We have all the doctors.
There is no other opinion.

623
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:33,878
Oh, God.
And so it begins.

624
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,998
Oh, God! (SOBS)

625
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,717
I cry for Stalin.
I cry for all the people.

626
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:40,000
I cry for the...
Courage.

627
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:43,838
Courage, little bird.
We're here for you.

628
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,318
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

629
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,278
Most of all, we cry for you,

630
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,758
little... bird.

631
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,320
We offer our tears,
though not as a gift, of course.

632
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:58,559
Oh, God.

633
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,798
I want Moscow cauterized, now.

634
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,998
<i>Cut off the city.</i>

635
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,318
Moscow's closed. No-one gets in.
Especially you.

636
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,039
NKVD to displace army officers
at every station.

637
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,760
Army back to barracks.
We're taking over.

638
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,440
Remove Molotov from that last list.

639
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,480
Implement our lists.

640
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,480
New lists.

641
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,438
New lists.

642
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,079
Ladies and gentlemen,
reset your watches.

643
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,237
New lists.
New lists.

644
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,597
New lists.
New lists.

645
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,239
New lists.
(GUNSHOT)

646
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,918
Trophy hunting, comrade?

647
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,318
Oh, Svetlana. No, no. I was...

648
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,557
We were just about to make a toast
to your father's health

649
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:11,077
and I know he kept
some fine vodka here somewhere.

650
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:13,597
Well, better you find it
than my brother.

651
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,519
Ah, yes. Vasily.

652
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:18,159
I got a hold of him
and he's on his way.

653
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:21,037
Oh...
Svetlana, I wanted to...

654
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:24,920
There was one day when my brother
just rode a pig through here.

655
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:28,597
That must have been messy.
It was terribly messy.

656
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:30,998
(LAUGHS)
And my father was so cross.

657
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,398
Papa just chased him
around the room in a circle.

658
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,717
Right here around this sofa,
just there, look.

659
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:40,318
Yes, I wanted to let you know
that no matter what happens,

660
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,157
I will never ever let any harm
come to you or your brother.

661
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:48,117
Who said anything about harm?
No, that's what I'm saying.

662
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:49,838
You know somebody
wants to harm us?

663
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,637
Tell me. I demand to know.
If someone...

664
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:53,557
No. I should not have used
the word "harm".

665
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:55,440
Yes. But you keep mentioning
the word "harm". Why?

666
00:37:56,199 --> 00:38:02,199
If anyone tries to... you,
they'll have to get through me first.

667
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,599
(LAUGHS WHEEZILY)

668
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,037
My father's going to die.

669
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:11,000
I'm going to have you
to look after me.

670
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,080
I mean, I may as well
just shoot myself like Mother.

671
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,480
Svetlana, we need to be strong.
Who would put a lamp on a chair?

We need to be strong
and never afraid.

674

I wasn't afraid. Now I am afraid.
Don't be, because if any harm...

676
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,517
can't believe you said that again.

back to the salt mine.

What's happening?
This is impossible...

and... and... and wonderful.

684
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,358
He's pointing...
What is it, Chief?

685
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,237
Maybe he's appointing his successor.

687
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:02,478
No.
Maybe not.

00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:05,037
What's he...
It's the painting.

No, Nicky. False narrative.

the evidence was flimsy.

I thank Comrade Khrushchev
for his concern,

967

of doing two things at once.

What about Comrade Khrushchev?
Where's this coming from?

979
00:55:35,559 --> 00:55:37,438
be given the honour
of organizing the funeral.

I don't have any time to do that.

you can at least do two.

were authorized by Stalin.

But Stalin was also loyal
to the collective leadership,

1045
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:40,237
Whatever. I don't care.
Not ruched?

1046
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:42,719
That's good. That's...
Ruched? Not ruched?

1047
00:59:43,239 --> 00:59:45,239
Ruched?
Would you stop with this?

1048
00:59:45,679 --> 00:59:47,879
Why do you think I care?
Ah, excuse me.

1049
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:51,717

00:59:57,519 --> 00:59:59,318
Yes, the ruched, please. Thank you.

1058
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,918
We couldn't find the actual girl, Sir.

1059
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,717
These are some possible alternatives.

1060
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:12,037

Excuse me.

the girl in the photograph.

Where's the girl in the photograph?

was to know everyone's whereabouts.

those precious fingers.

01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,077
Yes. One moment, General.

1093
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:56,478
I will properly catch up with you
this evening.

1094
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,838
I'm looking forward to it.
You never kiss my hand any more.

Yes, you did.

been confined to barracks?

supported by Comrade Malenkov.

1238
01:09:18,199 --> 01:09:20,518
There are programmatic complications.

No, no. You both called
the blameless Polina Molotova

01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:38,558
a traitor and a parasite
in her own apartment. I heard you.

You found her guilty.

That was what Stalin demanded.

01:10:58,199 --> 01:10:59,397
Correct, Comrade Molotov?

1281
01:10:59,399 --> 01:11:02,558
Um, allegiance to the party line? Yes.

1282
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,558
And defiance of the party line,

1283
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,560
that would mark you out
as a traitor, wouldn't it?

for my selfish deceitfulness,

Oh, don't be hysterical.

his bit-on-the-side whore pianist

1298
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:49,317
to play at the funeral,
even though she swore to kill Stalin,

1299
01:11:49,319 --> 01:11:50,437

are you talking about?

and she knows your family.

to play, remember?

Yes, Uncle Nicky's going to be dead

1528
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,918
if he doesn't get a move on, isn't he?

1529
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,239
Yes, he is.

BERIA: How's my guest?

1531
01:23:00,479 --> 01:23:02,639
Yes, I'm working on my speech.
It's good.

1532
01:23:03,119 --> 01:23:04,279
I've brought you something.

1533
01:23:06,279 --> 01:23:07,598
No.

1534
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,558
I'm not drinking.
I'm using water.

1535
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:11,477
It's just to calm your nerves.

1536
01:23:11,479 --> 01:23:12,878
Yes, actually,
I will need some of that.

1537
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,400
No. He's not drinking.
No, I'm not drinking.

1538
01:23:16,279 --> 01:23:18,998
How's the speech?
Um... Ba-dum-Ba-dum...

1539
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,119
My father...

1540
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,240
was a warm and mighty bear,

1541
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:29,598
and we are his 170 million
orphaned cubs.

1542
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:33,558
Russian cubs, Georgian cubs,
Armenian cubs, Lithuanian...

1543
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,798
We'll leave you to it. Come on.

1544
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,718
So, Lithuanian cubs,

Attempted escape from Kolyma
with 12 others.

1550

Executed. I'm sorry.

1551
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,918
But you said you would get him back.

1552
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:05,197
Listen, it was outside my direct
control. It just wasn't possible.

1553
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:07,918
Yes, but you said that
you would attempt the impossible.

1554
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:11,840
I hate being sober. It's a terrible,
terrible mood to be in.

1555
01:24:13,119 --> 01:24:14,397
Why don't we go through that speech

1556
01:24:14,399 --> 01:24:15,798
one more time?
Sit down.

1557
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,237
Get off me.
I can see what you're doing.

1558
01:24:17,239 --> 01:24:18,639
I don't want to sit down.
Sit down.

(SCREAMS)
I don't want to sit down!

1560
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:29,277
Right, many terrible things were done
in the service of the Union.

1561
01:24:29,279 --> 01:24:31,237
Evidence was fabricated.

1562
01:24:31,239 --> 01:24:33,838
Those who are responsible
will be found...

1563
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,397
And what will you do to them?
Question them to death?

1564
01:24:36,399 --> 01:24:37,518
You know what I'm doing?

1565
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:39,798
I'm offering you and
that bloated soak my protection.

We are not children!
You are a real listener. Thank you.

I am not a child.
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

or you will both be beaten inside out

Because I'm the only one
who's telling you.

Yes, 100 percent.

So you're on board, then, Molotov?
Yeah.

Action? What action?

1647
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:47,240
Is this why everyone is treating me
like they wanna fuck my sister?

1648
01:28:48,439 --> 01:28:50,878
Zhukov has everybody on board
against Beria.

1649
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:52,558
When I heard that, I agreed too.
Yes, yes.

1650
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:57,317
But Zhukov...
is not governing the Soviet Union.

1651
01:28:57,319 --> 01:29:00,477
I am governing the Soviet Union.

1652

Do you understand that?
Yes.

Now, I like him and I'll be happy
to listen to what he has to say.

You'll definitely have a chance
to talk to him.

1655
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:11,197
Perhaps what we can do
is give Beria a slight demotion,

Item one, the unfortunate events
of yesterday evening.

I would like to propose a new agenda.

the conduct of Comrade Beria.

within his Ministry

What button?
