1
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,860
Hang on, hang on.

2
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:20,198
Where are you, Charlie?
More importantly, where is my money?

3
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:23,632
- You're into me for 30 grand.
- Alright,Jack..Jack..Jack, I'm going to pay you.

4
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:26,102
This ain't Jack! Lt's Bill Panner.

5
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:29,732
You owe Jack money, too?
You pay me first!

6
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:34,609
Bill. We're good, buddy. I got your
money. It's right here in my hand.

7
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,614
Why don't we meet up on the?

8
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:44,156
- Your phone's going all screwy. Hello?
- I'm losing you.

9
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,748
I can't hear what you're say...

10
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,993
Hey, mister. Is that Ambush?

11
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:55,894
- Yeah.
- Can we see him?

12
00:03:57,236 --> 00:03:59,636
- You want to see him?
- Yeah.

13
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,003
Give me a minute.

14
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,306
This...

15
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,779
...is Ambush. Wakey, wakey.

16
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:37,072
- What robot is he fighting?
- Actually he's going to fight...

17
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:38,734
Whoa, little lady. What are you doing?

18
00:04:38,844 --> 00:04:40,141
Can we get a picture with him?

19
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:41,907
Sure. For five dollars.

20
00:04:42,014 --> 00:04:44,107
You want five dollars? Seriously?

21
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:46,844
No, I want five dollars immediately.

22
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,648
Come on, guys.

23
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:53,422
- All right, I'm kidding. Three bucks.
- Whatever.

24
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,354
- How about $2.50?
- You suck!

25
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:01,997
It's going to be one
of those towns, huh?

26
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:07,838
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.

27
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,398
Please take your seats. We're almost
ready to get this thing started.

28
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,147
I was told my bot
was fighting an 800-pound steer.

29
00:05:16,248 --> 00:05:18,978
That is not 800 pounds, knucklehead.

30
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:24,045
Charlie "the Can Do Kid" Kenton. Time
has not been good to you, my friend.

31
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:28,786
- Ricky, we got a big problem here.
- Slow down there, hoss.

32
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:33,388
Last time I saw you, you were staring
at the ceiling at the Sam Houston Center

33
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:35,997
with the taste of my right cross
all over your face.

34
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,935
- Are we good to go here?
- Yeah.

35
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:43,907
We agreed that my boxer would fight
an 800-pound steer for three grand.

36
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,739
- Am I right?
- Yes, sir. We did.

37
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,870
That bull is like 2,000 pounds.

38
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,470
I'll tell you something.

39
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:53,980
Your bot don't fight,
you don't get paid! How about that?

40
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,413
Get the hell out of here.

41
00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:05,092
Why don't we make this more interesting.
My bot against your bull, straight up.

42
00:06:05,197 --> 00:06:07,256
- How much?
- Twenty grand, winner takes all.

43
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:10,028
- Twenty grand. You got 20 grand?
- In a safe in my truck.

44
00:06:13,472 --> 00:06:14,996
All right, Charlie.

45
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:19,237
Twenty grand it is,
but if you lose and you welch,

46
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,836
I'll come after you and beat you
to within an inch of your life.

47
00:06:21,947 --> 00:06:24,108
You know that I can do that
because I already done done it!

48
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:28,050
In life you get too close, in the ring
you stand back like a girl. Just shake.

49
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:33,257
All right. Shake and pow! Just like that
once again. You want to dance again?

50
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:36,817
Cheer for this guy. Give him some luck.
He needs some luck, y'all.

51
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:39,923
Don't touch that bull.

52
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:43,126
Ladies and gentlemen, I got to ask,

53
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:45,795
do we have any fans
of robot boxing here today?

54
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:50,466
Now, listen, friends, I understand

55
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:54,371
we can't all afford to go
all the way over there to Dallas

56
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,417
and pay $300 for one of those
World Robot Boxing League fights.

57
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:02,817
So, I decided that I would bring
a robot boxing match

58
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,289
right here to our little fair
here in San Leandro.

59
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:07,825
How about that?

60
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:15,022
Ladies and gentlemen,
I introduce to you,

61
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:17,796
Ambush!

62
00:07:17,903 --> 00:07:19,200
Let's do it!

63
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:23,204
All right, big fella.

64
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,509
He's a big fella, ain't he?

65
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:34,252
Take a turn.
Let them see how beautiful you are.

66
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:40,116
Show them some power.

67
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,093
Look at that.
He's getting all kung fu-y on us.

68
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:46,526
Yeah, big fella.

69
00:07:46,832 --> 00:07:49,892
Ambush's opponent today,
he's last year's runner-up

70
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:52,061
in the baddest of the bulls competition,

71
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:55,004
ladies and gentlemen,

72
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,871
Black Thunder!

73
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:02,008
- Let's get it on!
- Let's get this thing started.

74
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:07,213
Is that all you got?

75
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:11,187
Yeah, brother. Bring it on.

76
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,532
Take him, take him.

77
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:27,470
Ambush lays the smackdown
on that prime beef.

78
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,405
I got more for you, big fella.
We're just getting started.

79
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:40,374
OK. Jump, now!

80
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,054
Ambush, decks Black Thunder,

81
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:53,461
but when you mess with the bull,
you're going to get the horns.

82
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,600
You like that. I can tell.
You like that.

83
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:01,632
Turn around!

84
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:08,072
Ricky! Ricky, stop this thing!

85
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:21,124
Come on. We're still in this thing.
Just hop. Hop.

86
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:23,554
That's it. Come on.

87
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,226
Ricky, enough! Enough!

88
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:33,499
I can't hear you over the sound
of your robot being destroyed.

89
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,100
Kill! Kill! Kill!

90
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:39,637
Come on, get up.

91
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,080
Get up! Come on!

92
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:46,642
No!

93
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:53,487
Come on, no. No, no, no!

94
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:03,293
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it
for our warriors out here today

95
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:06,098
at the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.

96
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,139
Thank you for coming out,

97
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,971
and we'll see you next time,
because there will be one.

98
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,036
Give me that leg.

99
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:16,046
Sure. For five dollars.

100
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,740
Boo-yah!

101
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:24,419
All right! That was ridonculous fun,
now wasn't it, ladies and gentlemen?

102
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:29,016
I'm going to come by for my money,
Charlie boy. You best have it.

103
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,187
- Everybody say "hey!"
- Hey!

104
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:35,097
- Everybody say "ho!"
- Ho!

105
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,397
How about that?
How you doing there, little robot?

106
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,712
My keys, damn it.

107
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:59,614
One more step
and I'll drop you like your girlfriend.

108
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,124
Charlie, relax.

109
00:11:01,226 --> 00:11:04,127
I'm not paying you. That was a bogus
fight. It cost me my last robot.

110
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:07,096
- Just listen to us.
- Do you recall Caroline Fallon?

111
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,669
She's my ex-girlfriend. I haven't seen
her in ten years. What does she want?

112
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:12,498
Nothing. She died.

113
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:14,738
Do you recall Max Kenton?

114
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:18,373
He's my son. He's got to be nine.

115
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:20,206
- Eleven.
- Eleven. OK.

116
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,204
Is he dead, too?

117
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,148
No, he's fine. That's why we're here.

118
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:56,144
This court is convened
to address the custodial status

119
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,512
of one Max Kenton, age 11.

120
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:03,247
Mother, Caroline Fallon, deceased.
Father, Charles Kenton.

121
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:05,380
Debra Fallon Barnes,
you're the boy's aunt.

122
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:10,793
Yes. As I've already told you,
my husband, Marvin, is wealthy,

123
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:14,463
and we can more than provide for Max.

124
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:18,093
I appreciate that, but per Texas
state law, without a written will

125
00:12:18,203 --> 00:12:20,137
next of kin retains custody.

126
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,402
Charles Kenton,
who is aware of this custody hearing,

127
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,806
and we are expecting him...

128
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,544
I need a new robot now.

129
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:30,137
I had a big fight
for Ambush next Saturday.

130
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,546
I got to show up with something.

131
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:36,553
Noisy Boy is for sale?
In his day, Noisy Boy was a killer.

132
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:39,351
How much? That's a good deal.
What's wrong with him?

133
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,721
I can live with that.

134
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,527
I don't have it.

135
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,691
Charles Kenton waived all of his rights
to custody right after the boy was born.

136
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,429
I can more than provide for Max.

137
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:54,866
Please be Charles Kenton.

138
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,507
Charlie, yeah.

139
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:03,247
I'm here to sign some paper
that releases my rights

140
00:13:03,348 --> 00:13:05,316
to the custody of my son.

141
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,351
That's why I'm here.
Do I need to be here?

142
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,715
Charlie.

143
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,245
Do you even remember me?

144
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,557
- Debra, Caroline's sister.
- Yeah, Debra. How are you?

145
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,594
Mr. Kenton. Please take a seat.

146
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,192
Your Honor, may I please go
and see my nephew now?

147
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,326
Yes, you may.

148
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,233
- How about you, Mr. Kenton?
- What?

149
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,772
You can spend some time
with him, if you'd like.

150
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:30,603
- With the kid?
- Yeah, the kid.

151
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,609
- Max. Your son?
- All right.

152
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:35,509
You've been working with those robots
for so long, you've become one.

153
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,284
Honey, you wait right here.
I'm going to be back.

154
00:13:39,384 --> 00:13:41,784
You take all the time you need,
sweetheart.

155
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:50,389
Your Honor, I'd like to,
at this juncture,

156
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,192
step out and call my attorney,
if that's all right.

157
00:13:53,298 --> 00:13:54,322
Please.

158
00:13:57,936 --> 00:14:02,305
Come on. Come on. There you are.

159
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,937
He'll be in a foster home.

160
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:10,341
No, they find good families.
Young. Energetic. Yeah.

161
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:14,975
Thanks, Michael. I will. OK.

162
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:21,350
- Marvin Barnes. I'm Debra's husband.
- Right, yeah.

163
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,429
Debra really wants to adopt Max.

164
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:29,800
- I'm up for it. But...
- Seventy-five grand.

165
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,994
$75,000? You're serious?

166
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,335
The thing is...

167
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:41,539
...we're supposed to go
to Italy this summer

168
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,410
with my oldest friend and his wife.

169
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,574
Two months in Tuscany and all over.

170
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,015
Just the four of you. Sounds nice.

171
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,549
We'll be back in New York
by the end of August.

172
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,517
In August. A hundred.

173
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,559
- $100,000?
- You heard me.

174
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,891
- You're crazy.
- Not nearly as crazy as your wife

175
00:14:57,996 --> 00:15:01,488
if you tell her I just signed over
that kid to the state of Texas.

176
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,263
There's a real way everyone gets
what they want here.

177
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,497
So here's what you're going to do.

178
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:10,666
You're going to tell your wife
I'll only sign over custody to her

179
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,903
if I get to spend the summer
with the kid first.

180
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:15,571
Just tell her how guilty
she made me feel

181
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:17,876
for being such
a terrible absentee dad,

182
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:22,283
how I want to make good with junior,
a little fatherly bonding, whatnot.

183
00:15:22,387 --> 00:15:26,323
She'll buy it, you get to be the hero
and everybody wins.

184
00:15:29,294 --> 00:15:32,957
OK. But not a word about the money
to Debra, you understand?

185
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,593
I understand.

186
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,896
I'll give you 50 grand tonight
when we drop off Max

187
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,471
and the other 50
when we get back in August

188
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,472
and you deliver him to us in New York.

189
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,738
Pleasure doing business with you.

190
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,843
Your Honor,
I'm happy we all took the time

191
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:51,575
to make the best decision for everyone.

192
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,614
- Happy?
- Yeah, it's me.

193
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,953
I'm buying Noisy Boy. I got the money.

194
00:16:00,058 --> 00:16:02,720
Take him to Tallet's Gym
and I'll meet you there.

195
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:18,967
Hello?

196
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,574
Bailey?

197
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,409
Some guy is here
with the robot you're buying,

198
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,779
and it smells like disaster to me.

199
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,374
Nice to see you, too.

200
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,387
- Might I also say how cute you look.
- Give it up.

201
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,925
God, I need a shower.
You want to take a shower? Come on.

202
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,857
Let me make something clear.

203
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:38,862
A creepy dude with a robot in a box

204
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:41,398
has been sitting outside my gym
for two hours.

205
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,400
Putting aside the fact
that you're doing

206
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,130
what I'm guessing is
a black market deal on my doorstep,

207
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,406
how will you pay him
when Ambush just got destroyed?

208
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,407
The money is on its way.
Just distract him.

209
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,840
I have been. It's exhausting.

210
00:16:51,943 --> 00:16:53,877
- You're the best.
- Yeah? Really?

211
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:57,005
Is that why you're buying a $45,000
robot when you owe me six grand in rent?

212
00:16:57,115 --> 00:16:58,605
- Because I'm the best?
- Three.

213
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:03,950
Six. There is a guy with real money
who wants to buy this place.

214
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,422
Come on. Like you're really
going to sell your dad's gym.

215
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,585
If you don't make rent, I can't make
payments and I won't have a choice.

216
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,629
Your father would climb out of his grave
and kick your ass

217
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,561
- if you sold this place.
- My father would climb out of his grave

218
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:14,962
and kick your ass.

219
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:18,693
Bailey?

220
00:17:24,776 --> 00:17:25,800
- Don't.
- Don't what?

221
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,469
Don't do that.

222
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,573
- Don't what?
- Don't do that thing.

223
00:17:34,152 --> 00:17:35,949
- No, you like that thing.
- No.

224
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:38,147
- Yeah.
- No, I don't like that thing.

225
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:42,416
I used to. Once. Briefly.
Now I like money more.

226
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:46,121
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.

227
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:49,691
Marvin.

228
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,761
Your money has arrived.

229
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:56,097
Marv.

230
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,805
Fifty grand, as promised.

231
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:08,881
Here are all our numbers
and contact info over in Europe.

232
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,716
So that's everything there.

233
00:18:13,658 --> 00:18:16,491
So Marvin tells me
you want this time with Max.

234
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,792
- Yeah.
- You did the right thing,

235
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,023
giving me custody.

236
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,622
Caroline would have wanted that.

237
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,563
Now, have him back in New York
on August 27th.

238
00:18:26,838 --> 00:18:28,032
That's a deal.

239
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,733
OK, let's go get Max.
OK? Let's get Max.

240
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:39,711
It's OK. You want to go around
the other side here and I'll get Max?

241
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:44,645
Hey. Max. See you, pal.

242
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,158
Max, we'll see you
at the end of the summer, honey.

243
00:18:58,069 --> 00:18:59,559
I'm Charlie.

244
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:06,069
It's been a long time.
You know, I'm your...

245
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,237
- You screwed me.
- Nice mouth.

246
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:09,605
Do you know where they're going?

247
00:19:09,714 --> 00:19:11,648
- Italy?
- Yeah, Italy.

248
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,047
So how did I get stuck here with you?

249
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:16,052
Relax, kid. You got a whole life
of fine living ahead of you.

250
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:17,178
Charlie!

251
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,887
Dude's pissed. He's going to take off.

252
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,094
- Did Marvin give you that money?
- Here, just close the deal.

253
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:25,823
I'll be right there, OK?

254
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,937
- I'm Bailey.
- Max.

255
00:19:34,739 --> 00:19:36,001
Max Kenton.

256
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,268
- So this is your...
- Yeah, it's him.

257
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:40,875
Don't worry about it, OK?

258
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,576
I'm looking at you two and...

259
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,946
Just go and put Noisy
in the shop, please? Thank you.

260
00:19:52,924 --> 00:19:54,858
You're going to stay here with her
while I'm on the road.

261
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,827
- How much did he give you?
- You're coming at this the wrong way.

262
00:19:57,929 --> 00:19:59,692
No, tell me. I want to know.

263
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,997
Fifty thousand, OK?

264
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:05,592
He gave me $50,000
to sign you over to her.

265
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,103
Will you shut up now?

266
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:08,932
You sold me?

267
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,732
Sounds worse than it is.

268
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:14,607
- Really.
- It's to take care of you.

269
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,044
Give me half the money
and you won't have to.

270
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:18,911
- Where are you going to go?
- Give me the money. I'll be fine.

271
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,281
I told your aunt I'll get you
to New York at the end of the summer.

272
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:23,019
Now you're concerned for Aunt Debra?

273
00:20:23,788 --> 00:20:26,279
You sold me for 50 grand.
You owe me half!

274
00:20:26,591 --> 00:20:30,857
I don't have it! I spent the money
on a robot. It's gone! OK? Gone!

275
00:20:30,962 --> 00:20:32,259
I'm through here.

276
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,974
What do we got?

277
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:44,837
Noisy Boy has arrived.

278
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,306
That's a lot of airline stickers
and customs tags.

279
00:20:48,613 --> 00:20:52,049
- He's been all over the world.
- London, Japan, Brazil, São Paulo...

280
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,778
Hasn't seen North American soil
in over two years.

281
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:57,013
Maybe that's why you got
such a good price, genius.

282
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:01,681
Decided to stay?

283
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:05,319
This is Bailey. She'll be looking
after you for a few weeks.

284
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,190
I need you to look after the kid
for a few weeks.

285
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,098
- I want half that money.
- Are we back to this again?

286
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,871
Is there a real robot boxer in there?

287
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,668
Noisy Boy's in there.
You ever heard of him?

288
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:20,267
Of course. He fought Rubicon
for the WRB belt in 2016.

289
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:28,676
Holy crap, he looks amazing.

290
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:34,352
His composite armor has been replaced.
Let's see if the insides look as good.

291
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:38,186
I've watched that fight
with Rubicon like 20 times.

292
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:40,093
He should have had him
in the third round,

293
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,962
but Rubicon got lucky
with a huge right and ended it.

294
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,973
Relax, kid, he's on our side.

295
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,075
- Not funny.
- Kind of funny.

296
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:02,778
You know he has voice recognition,
right?

297
00:22:02,887 --> 00:22:04,684
- No, he doesn't.
- He didn't in the League.

298
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:06,723
When Noisy fought in Brazil,
they must have put it in.

299
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,316
Brazilians are crazy
about that talk-to-your-robot crap.

300
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,993
Right, left, uppercut!

301
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:21,133
Doesn't work. Right, left, uppercut!

302
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:23,434
I knew that price was too good
to be true. We got screwed.

303
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:26,176
- Let me see if I can fix it.
- Look how good he looks, too.

304
00:22:26,277 --> 00:22:28,268
Give me two seconds.
Let me look at something!

305
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,746
- Why didn't you ask to look at it?
- Relax!

306
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,751
Was that Japanese?

307
00:22:42,827 --> 00:22:44,351
Let me see if I can reset him
to English.

308
00:22:44,462 --> 00:22:46,054
How do you know Japanese?

309
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:47,756
Video games.

310
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,361
You play video games in Japanese?

311
00:22:50,468 --> 00:22:52,197
Japanese bootlegs are always better.

312
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,407
Give me that.

313
00:23:00,478 --> 00:23:02,912
He's reset to English,
and I found his command matrix.

314
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:05,244
They have pre-Ioaded
a bunch of combinations.

315
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,841
They should be listed here.

316
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,179
Top salvo!

317
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,418
What did I tell you?

318
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,319
Gravity One Downtown!

319
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:24,798
I was due for some good luck!

320
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,370
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

321
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:29,406
Bailey, help me put him in the truck.
I am going to go and get your money.

322
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:45,281
- Give me the keys.
- I'm coming with you.

323
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,119
- No, you're not.
- Why not?

324
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:49,090
Because I don't want you with me, OK?

325
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:53,062
I'm either coming with you, or you're
fishing for your keys in the sewer.

326
00:23:53,164 --> 00:23:55,997
Your choice.
What's it going to be, old man?

327
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:59,832
Oh, my God. That was close, wasn't it?

328
00:24:01,372 --> 00:24:04,239
- Don't do that again.
- That's scaring you, isn't it?

329
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:06,037
Don't do this again?

330
00:24:06,544 --> 00:24:09,012
Get in. Just get in.
Give me the keys first.

331
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,810
Wait till I get in the truck.
Thanks, Big Pops.

332
00:24:18,389 --> 00:24:19,549
Sweet ride.

333
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:22,418
Put on your seatbelt and don't talk.

334
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:46,075
I'm taking all bets!

335
00:25:11,442 --> 00:25:13,307
Keep up. Stay close.

336
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:19,416
Charlie Kenton is in the house!

337
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:22,042
- All right, all right.
- Come on, man!

338
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:26,152
- Is that Noisy Boy?
- The one and only.

339
00:25:26,257 --> 00:25:28,248
That's Noisy Boy!

340
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,158
Noisy's been in Japan.
Softer bots over there.

341
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:37,461
- Sure you want to fight him tonight?
- What do you got?

342
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,935
He can take any bot in this place.
You know it.

343
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:43,069
You can have any undercard you want.

344
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:44,471
Five thousand guaranteed.

345
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:47,511
A thousand every round
your bot survives.

346
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,512
Fight till the death!

347
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:54,615
No. Give me the main event.

348
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:57,080
- Come on.
- This is Noisy Boy.

349
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:58,621
An original Tak Mashido bot.

350
00:25:58,923 --> 00:26:01,483
He was a World Robot League boxer.
Come on!

351
00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:06,195
You want to fight Midas?

352
00:26:06,297 --> 00:26:09,425
Fifty thousand guaranteed,
winner takes all.

353
00:26:10,935 --> 00:26:13,995
Fifty? Really, 50? Now you're talking.

354
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,005
Listen, listen. No, look.

355
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,631
- Listen!
- Give me a sec.

356
00:26:17,942 --> 00:26:21,139
We should take an undercard fight,
make a little cash and get out of here!

357
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,508
First, there is no "we."

358
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:25,981
Second, he's going to crush Midas,
and I'm going to make real cash!

359
00:26:26,951 --> 00:26:28,646
We'll take Midas!

360
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,000
Tonight, our main event

361
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:49,096
features the gold-blooded killer!

362
00:26:50,441 --> 00:26:53,035
This pimped-out punk

363
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:56,739
is programmed for pain!

364
00:26:57,548 --> 00:27:02,576
I give to you the mighty Midas!

365
00:27:43,494 --> 00:27:46,395
Against a bot

366
00:27:46,497 --> 00:27:51,332
who ran with the big boys in the WRB!

367
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:57,334
He's been on an exile tour overseas,
but now he's back home,

368
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,740
and he's ready to make some noise!

369
00:28:00,044 --> 00:28:03,605
Take your first look in a long time

370
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:08,482
at Noisy Boy!

371
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,251
Crash Palace,

372
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:53,262
who's ready for some destruction?!

373
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:57,857
Let's make some money! Come on!

374
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:00,865
We have Midas against Noisy Boy.

375
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:03,140
Noisy Boy against Midas.

376
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:06,472
You've been waiting all night
for this matchup, Crash Palace!

377
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:14,116
Scimitar right!

378
00:29:17,221 --> 00:29:18,745
Did you see that?

379
00:29:18,856 --> 00:29:22,155
Easy money, easy money all night.
All night long!

380
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,423
Come on! It's not over yet. Let's go!

381
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:27,563
Skull salvo! Firefight!

382
00:29:30,334 --> 00:29:33,326
- Yeah! Go, Noisy!
- Undercard, huh?

383
00:29:35,873 --> 00:29:37,170
Shockfist!

384
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:42,208
Get in there. Shogun Trinity!

385
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:45,911
Let's finish him. Gravity Slam, Uptown!

386
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,910
This son-of-a-bitch is crazy!

387
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,653
Full Metal Feud! Bring it!

388
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,855
Southpaw! Pain Revolution!

389
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,491
I got something for you.

390
00:30:04,735 --> 00:30:07,727
Don't you run from me!
You can't run from me!

391
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:10,900
Get up!

392
00:30:14,178 --> 00:30:15,304
That's illegal!

393
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:17,506
This is the underworld.
There are no rules!

394
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:19,882
Now we're seeing the Midas touch.

395
00:30:20,184 --> 00:30:21,378
No. Hands up!

396
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,546
Get back in that corner, bitch,
and take this whooping like a man!

397
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,222
He's getting killed in there!

398
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:36,863
It's a headset! You talk into it
and you tell him what to do!

399
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,430
Panic Shield!

400
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,430
That's it. One-Two Overlord!

401
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:48,239
No, no. Shatter Punch!

402
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,247
- Five Recall!
- Get some!

403
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,425
Jab, jab!

404
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:09,858
Right roundhouse!

405
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:13,459
Did he just spit his juice
in Midas's face?

406
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:16,233
No, you did not spit in Midas's face!

407
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,672
It's party time now, Crash Palace!

408
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:19,868
Use your left!

409
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,676
Noisy's trying to do something
with his one arm!

410
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,943
But Midas pins him,
and Daddy goes to work!

411
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:33,717
No, no! Get up!

412
00:31:35,459 --> 00:31:36,517
Get some!

413
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,330
Move! Get out of the corner!

414
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:43,798
Midas! Midas! Midas!

415
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:49,028
Somebody's ready
to serve up a decappuccino!

416
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,365
I got something for you! You ready?

417
00:31:53,277 --> 00:31:56,713
Good night! That's a home run for Midas.

418
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:59,647
And so long to Noisy Boy.

419
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,513
That sucked. You hungry?

420
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:37,386
I saved what's left
of Noisy's voice recognition board.

421
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:40,355
Other than that, he's trash.
I got to get a new robot together.

422
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,086
I need to find a mainframe. What?

423
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,624
- I hate hamburgers.
- What kid hates burgers?

424
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,029
Fine. More for me. Here, drink this.

425
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:50,891
You never should have taken that fight.

426
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:53,368
Really? Really? Thanks, genius.

427
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,770
Do you even think about the stuff you do
before you do it?

428
00:32:56,874 --> 00:32:59,069
You had no idea how to fight that fight.

429
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:02,676
Those combination codes, you didn't
know what half of them even meant.

430
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,510
You threw them in there cocky
and half-assed.

431
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:08,050
- You never gave him a chance.
- He wasn't that good.

432
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,785
Noisy Boy was a great robot.

433
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:12,685
Was. Was a great robot
back in the League, back in the day.

434
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:16,783
But look around you. This place is
where once great robots go to die.

435
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:18,452
So throw him away.

436
00:33:18,562 --> 00:33:21,656
That's what you do, right?
Anything you don't need you throw away.

437
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:24,860
Wow.

438
00:33:27,371 --> 00:33:28,668
It's been a long night.

439
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,968
If you want to sleep indoors tonight,
shut up and get in the truck.

440
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,940
Don't look at me like that way.
Get in the truck!

441
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,402
They gave me 400 for his head.

442
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:24,584
You stay put.
I'm going to look for parts.

443
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:27,721
I'm coming with you.
That drink has my heart pounding.

444
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,959
If I sit in this truck by myself,
my head will explode.

445
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:31,659
Whatever. Just keep up.

446
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,677
Crap.

447
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:46,079
Stay back.

448
00:34:57,928 --> 00:34:59,589
All right, keep up.

449
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:03,726
These searchlights are automated,
but you got to time them right,

450
00:35:03,834 --> 00:35:04,892
so stay close.

451
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,764
It's all right.

452
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,172
Come on, come on.

453
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,679
- We're going to get caught.
- Come on.

454
00:35:17,114 --> 00:35:19,514
Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

455
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,814
Quick, quick. Down in here! Go, go, go!

456
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:28,656
Robots are on the east side.
We got to be quick in here.

457
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:33,920
Once we're through here,
there's no more searchlights. Quick! Go!

458
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,780
- Here it is.
- What are we looking for?

459
00:35:52,883 --> 00:35:55,511
Anything I could use
to put a fighting bot together.

460
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:57,644
- Hey, look.
- What?

461
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,781
It's so small.

462
00:36:01,892 --> 00:36:03,621
Yeah. That's before your time.

463
00:36:03,727 --> 00:36:06,821
That's a Generation One,
the very first fighting bot.

464
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:10,128
They wanted them to look like us.
The more human, the better.

465
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:13,032
Crazy how quick everything changed.
Put that in the cart.

466
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:16,265
- What changed?
- A good question. Human boxing.

467
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:18,542
- It just faded.
- Why?

468
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:23,874
Because the money moved on.
People wanted more carnage, more show.

469
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:27,075
You had the whole Brazilian underground,
the Gracies, the Machados,

470
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:30,551
jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai,
and a thousand styles in between.

471
00:36:30,654 --> 00:36:31,985
Full-on ground-and-pound.

472
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:33,317
- Look at this.
- What's that?

473
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:34,784
I don't know.

474
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:36,154
Not bad. Good spot.

475
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:39,291
You still had human fighters,
human bodies,

476
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,827
so you couldn't give the people
what they really wanted:

477
00:36:41,932 --> 00:36:44,196
True, no-holds-barred violence.

478
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:49,031
The next logical step,

479
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:52,267
get the humans out of there
and let the machines kill each other.

480
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:54,767
Do you miss it?

481
00:36:57,214 --> 00:36:59,774
- Boxing. Do you miss it?
- Careful.

482
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,317
What? I want to know.

483
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,179
Careful, you're on a cliff.

484
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:10,893
That's a long way down.
If you fell, you'd definitely...

485
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:22,662
Charlie, help me!

486
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:48,264
Charlie!

487
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,330
- Charlie!
- Max! Max!

488
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:55,295
Max!

489
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:01,837
- Try not to move!
- I'm on some sort of robot arm.

490
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:05,973
Wait! Just easy, easy.
Give me your hand. Nice and easy.

491
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:10,417
Very slowly. Good. Don't look down.
Look at me. Look at me.

492
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:14,418
That's it! I've got you!
You don't have to be scared. I got you!

493
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:17,023
- It's so far!
- It's OK. I got you.

494
00:38:17,127 --> 00:38:19,425
Give me your other hand. Nice and slow.

495
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:25,090
Just give me your other hand very
slowly. Reach back. Come on. Reach!

496
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:27,830
Look at me.
We're going to do this together.

497
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:31,135
You and me. Just look at me. That's it.

498
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:35,701
One... two... three!

499
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:43,015
That's it. I got you!
I got you. I got you. I got you.

500
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,922
You're safe. You're safe.

501
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,130
All right, I got you.

502
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:58,792
- You all right?
- Yeah.

503
00:38:58,902 --> 00:39:01,302
Come here. Easy. Easy.

504
00:39:03,073 --> 00:39:04,438
You all right?

505
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,073
- You all right?
- Yeah.

506
00:39:06,176 --> 00:39:08,110
I told you it was dangerous.

507
00:39:08,912 --> 00:39:10,436
Careful. We're still on the edge here.

508
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,454
Charlie, I think
there's a whole robot in there.

509
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,026
So what? Let's go. Come on.

510
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,766
I'm taking him with me.
He saved my life.

511
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:34,201
He did not save your life.
I saved your life. Let's go.

512
00:39:34,304 --> 00:39:37,296
Just bring the cart to the edge.
I'll use the winch to get him out.

513
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:40,935
You want that piece of junk? You get
the cart yourself. I'm through here.

514
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,541
This is what's left of Noisy Boy?

515
00:41:27,851 --> 00:41:28,875
That's it.

516
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,546
His head does make a nice addition
to the front of the Crash Palace.

517
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:35,919
- It's not funny.
- Let's get a robot, you and me.

518
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:39,154
Good idea. You're broke.
I'm almost there myself.

519
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:42,130
- You destroyed the best shot you had.
- We'll put one together.

520
00:41:42,232 --> 00:41:43,460
You're brilliant at this.
There's good stuff here.

521
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,899
- There's nothing here.
- There is. Look.

522
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,972
All your junk is... it's junk.

523
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:53,168
You're not even in the game anymore.

524
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:55,211
- It's all garbage.
- I heard you. It's garbage.

525
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:57,075
Don't get loud with me.

526
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,081
- You're your problem.
- What's that supposed to mean?

527
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:02,084
I have been here for you a long time.

528
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:05,952
In the ring, out of the ring, and the
whole ugly spiral down, and I'm tired.

529
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:10,117
My father invested everything he had
in your fight career. We loved...

530
00:42:11,628 --> 00:42:16,463
He loved you like family.
And this is his home.

531
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:19,931
I'm just trying not to let it die.
That's my plan.

532
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,502
What's yours?

533
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:36,046
You're done, right?

534
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:40,988
You're finally done?
Because I sure as hell am, Charlie.

535
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:43,525
I got nothing left.

536
00:42:45,562 --> 00:42:46,586
All right.

537
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:50,929
Maybe there's something here.

538
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:56,071
This robot the kid brought in last
night. Would you look at it for me?

539
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:57,631
Please?

540
00:43:06,516 --> 00:43:11,249
I've never seen anything like it before.
He's Generation Two, but barely.

541
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:16,019
I found a power cell that fits him, and
I hooked him up to this old G-2 remote.

542
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:18,253
You can move him around, but he's crap.

543
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:21,297
Maybe I can get a sparring gig for him,
make a few hundred bucks.

544
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:22,592
Stop.

545
00:43:22,699 --> 00:43:24,394
It's my robot!

546
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:28,198
It took me half the night
dragging him out of there. He's mine.

547
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:31,968
He's yours? Yeah. But the parts
we're putting in him are mine!

548
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:36,542
You idiots should see if he powers up
before you fight over him.

549
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,114
What happened to you?

550
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,467
Watch out. Stay back.

551
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:20,054
Looks like he's got a shadow function.
That's pretty rare.

552
00:44:20,757 --> 00:44:23,225
He can mime your movements
and store them in memory.

553
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,194
- Is there anything here we could use?
- Not much.

554
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:27,354
There's a bucket...

555
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:30,725
There's a bucket
I use to wash the truck.

556
00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:33,730
Use it and clean him up.
He smells like crap.

557
00:44:34,037 --> 00:44:36,733
Wash yourself off, too,
while you're at it. You stink.

558
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,203
I switched him to remote.
It's pretty basic.

559
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:42,608
Just use the toggles here
to steer him and walk him.

560
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:46,214
- You play video games, right?
- Of course.

561
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:49,149
Same idea, only this one's
a thousand-pound robot.

562
00:44:49,686 --> 00:44:50,710
Cool.

563
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,519
"Atom."

564
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:37,266
His name is Atom.
Can we get him a fight?

565
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:38,664
I don't think he was
ever a boxing robot.

566
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:42,796
He's a G-2, built in early 2014.
He was a sparring bot.

567
00:45:43,106 --> 00:45:44,368
They must have built robots
like this one

568
00:45:44,474 --> 00:45:46,533
that could mirror the fighting style
of any other robot.

569
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:48,804
OK, so can we get him a fight?

570
00:45:49,112 --> 00:45:51,603
Are you not listening?
He's a sparring bot.

571
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:54,411
Built to take a lot of hits, but never
dishing out any real punishment.

572
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:56,179
You could always sell him off for parts.

573
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:59,653
- Can't you get him a fight?
- "Why can't you get him a fight?"

574
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:01,553
God, you don't quit, do you?

575
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:04,593
You want me to put him in some
bottom-rung scrap-fest to the death?

576
00:46:04,694 --> 00:46:07,629
I saw how scared you were
at Crash Palace.

577
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:11,895
The places that would let you fight this
robot would make you pee your pants.

578
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:14,466
Excellent. Get him a fight.

579
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:21,601
Stubborn kid.

580
00:46:21,711 --> 00:46:23,611
Surprise, surprise.

581
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:06,345
Let's take a walk.

582
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:17,450
Can you understand me?

583
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:28,565
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

584
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:55,426
You've known Charlie a long time.

585
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:59,765
Too long.
We both kind of grew up in this gym.

586
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:03,002
My dad, he trained him.

587
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:06,874
That's them. That's Charlie.

588
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,437
- What was he like?
- As a boxer?

589
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:13,743
- As anything.
- He was something.

590
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:17,581
He was lean, tough.

591
00:49:17,687 --> 00:49:19,587
No quit, no fear.

592
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:26,019
Come here. I want to show you something.

593
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:31,895
I have this newspaper article
from Phoenix 2007

594
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:35,768
when Charlie fought Nico Tandy,
the top contender.

595
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:37,396
You were at the Nico Tandy fight?

596
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:41,500
I was. Charlie was supposed to be
a warm-up fight, an easy win.

597
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:44,910
Nico wasn't even supposed
to break a sweat, but...

598
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:50,551
...nobody told Charlie that, so he
just kept coming and coming at him.

599
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:51,951
Check this out.

600
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:56,117
That's Charlie.

601
00:49:58,028 --> 00:50:00,724
First, Nico couldn't believe
the balls on this nobody.

602
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:05,529
But Charlie kept coming,
and that's when Nico looked scared.

603
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:07,466
- Really?
- Really.

604
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:09,128
He was toying with Nico.

605
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:11,930
The top contender,
number two in the world,

606
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:14,101
and Charlie was dancing with him.

607
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:18,939
Charlie was floating
inches off the canvas that night.

608
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:21,950
He was like a ghost.
Nico couldn't even see him.

609
00:50:23,386 --> 00:50:24,751
I could.

610
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:28,754
He was beautiful.

611
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:31,123
He was beautiful.

612
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:36,831
So what happened?
Did Charlie beat Nico Tandy?

613
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:40,699
No, Nico Tandy put me on my ass
in the 12th round. Twice.

614
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:42,669
Second time for good. Lights out.

615
00:50:42,772 --> 00:50:44,069
You were ahead on the scorecards

616
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:46,501
- going into the 12th round.
- Nico Tandy rung my bell

617
00:50:46,609 --> 00:50:49,510
and went on to be the undefeated
world champ for the next three years.

618
00:50:49,612 --> 00:50:51,637
- He knocked you out?
- Yeah. So did a lot of guys.

619
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:53,045
You knocked a lot of guys out, too.

620
00:50:53,149 --> 00:50:57,609
- 24 and 19. It's not exactly a career.
- But every fight a knockout.

621
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,120
- Yeah.
- Win or lose, fight's not over

622
00:50:59,422 --> 00:51:00,889
- till someone's on the mat.
- Till someone's on the mat.

623
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:03,515
- Your old man taught me that.
- Damn straight he taught you that.

624
00:51:03,626 --> 00:51:05,753
- Who else did you fight?
- Go get your stuff together.

625
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:07,796
I don't need to.
Did you fight for the title?

626
00:51:07,897 --> 00:51:11,458
Yeah, you do. We leave in an hour. Go.

627
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,126
Wow. Here.

628
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:16,597
Keep it.

629
00:51:17,807 --> 00:51:20,435
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

630
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:26,745
I like that kid.

631
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:28,947
He likes you.

632
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:37,484
- What I said yesterday was...
- No, nothing more to say.

633
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:40,720
I'm heading off to Atlanta tonight

634
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:44,027
to see if I can get a partner
or raise money to get a new bot.

635
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:49,071
That's what you wanted, right? Me gone?

636
00:51:53,209 --> 00:51:55,677
Yeah, that's what I wanted.

637
00:52:04,053 --> 00:52:05,077
OK.

638
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:42,250
Look.

639
00:52:49,532 --> 00:52:52,160
The champ is here. Zeus is here.

640
00:52:52,268 --> 00:52:53,895
Yeah.

641
00:52:55,939 --> 00:53:01,377
Zeus! No one has ever gone two rounds
with this monster. Two rounds!

642
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:04,739
The champ puts his Real Steel world
championship belt on the line tonight.

643
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,839
He just may have a real fight
on his hands.

644
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:12,252
Zeus, greatest robot boxer of all time.
Ever. End of story. Good night!

645
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:15,717
- So cool. It's so cool.
- What?

646
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:19,852
Come on.

647
00:53:22,765 --> 00:53:24,824
Listen up. I got to go find Finn.

648
00:53:24,934 --> 00:53:26,731
I want you to stay in this area.

649
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:30,872
Out of the way. Champ coming through.
Zeus coming through.

650
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:32,601
Move, move. Champ coming through.

651
00:53:44,787 --> 00:53:47,915
Farra Lemkova, daughter behind
the father/daughter Zeus team.

652
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:51,687
They say your father's the money
and you are the mind behind Zeus.

653
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:53,685
You're very kind,

654
00:53:53,796 --> 00:53:57,732
but I assure you, the mind behind Zeus
belongs to the great Tak Mashido.

655
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:02,335
What did it take to lure
the reclusive genius, former boy wonder

656
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:05,802
and arguably the most important
bot designer in the history of the sport

657
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,342
out of retirement?

658
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:10,769
Why don't you ask him yourself?

659
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:18,177
Is this Tak Mashido's greatest creation?

660
00:54:19,822 --> 00:54:23,883
Zeus is autonomous
and constantly evolving during a fight.

661
00:54:23,993 --> 00:54:26,018
With his adaptive operating system,

662
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:31,089
he recognizes patterns and rewrites
his fight code instantaneously.

663
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:35,797
For myself and Joe Sixpack out there,
are you saying that Zeus?

664
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:40,171
I'm saying that no matter
what happens in that ring...

665
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:44,377
...the result of any fight is inevitable.

666
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:47,172
What Zeus sees...

667
00:54:48,751 --> 00:54:50,048
...he kills.

668
00:54:51,654 --> 00:54:53,212
Sweet.

669
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:23,785
I'm never going into business with you.

670
00:55:23,886 --> 00:55:25,114
I just need a break here.

671
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:27,985
You got that old bot truck out there.
You always got something in there.

672
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:30,685
I got an old sparring bot,
ain't worth the paint left on it.

673
00:55:30,793 --> 00:55:32,260
What am I supposed to do with that?

674
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:35,126
The Zoo. Take him to the Zoo.
They fight there tomorrow.

675
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:37,256
Even I wouldn't be caught dead
at the Zoo.

676
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:39,267
I just need a little loan.

677
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:41,930
What?

678
00:55:42,905 --> 00:55:44,805
- You're serious, Charlie?
- A loan.

679
00:55:44,907 --> 00:55:47,068
Couple hundred. Few hundred.
Whatever you got.

680
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:49,703
You know I'm good for it.

681
00:55:49,812 --> 00:55:53,441
I know you, and as much
as I like you, dude...

682
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,311
...you're a bad bet, brother.

683
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:01,315
Right, yeah.

684
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:23,902
Did you see that?
That's what's left of Axelrod.

685
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:25,878
Where you been? I told you to stay put.

686
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:28,212
You should have seen him.
Zeus was, like, amazing!

687
00:56:28,317 --> 00:56:30,308
- Amazing, huh?
- Unbelievable, yeah.

688
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:34,754
He was just peppering Axelrod with
punches, but so fast. It was incredible.

689
00:56:34,857 --> 00:56:38,315
Axelrod didn't even land a punch.
He didn't even survive the first round.

690
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:39,520
Is that what you think boxing is?

691
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:41,854
Zeus beating up some piece of steel
that they feed him?

692
00:56:41,964 --> 00:56:44,865
Axelrod's not just some piece of steel.
And that is what boxing is now.

693
00:56:44,967 --> 00:56:47,435
Deal with it.
And I love it, and I'm in it now.

694
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:50,763
You're in it now, are you?
You and your G-2 sparring bot?

695
00:56:50,873 --> 00:56:54,206
He's more than that.
If you'd get us a fight, you'd see.

696
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:57,336
You're in luck, kid.
There's a lovely place called the Zoo.

697
00:56:57,447 --> 00:56:59,210
Tomorrow afternoon,
you'll get your fight.

698
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:01,783
- Great.
- And it will be the end.

699
00:57:02,852 --> 00:57:05,116
I told you I hate hamburgers!

700
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:10,118
It's a burrito!

701
00:57:19,168 --> 00:57:20,795
Right uppercut.

702
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:25,170
Left uppercut.

703
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:31,812
Bend your knees.
Rise up with both hands.

704
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:38,044
Again. Bend your knees.
Rise up with both hands.

705
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:40,384
You been up all night?

706
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:42,014
Yeah. I cleaned him up.

707
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:45,424
I'm using shadow mode to program some
fight moves and sync them to the remote.

708
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:48,964
Yeah. I saw that double-up punch
you were showing him.

709
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:51,260
That's lethal stuff.

710
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:52,527
Let's do this.

711
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:55,828
Let's do breakfast first.

712
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:35,043
You know you're bringing him
home in pieces, right?

713
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:38,339
We'll see.

714
00:58:46,522 --> 00:58:49,457
- Let me deal with this.
- Charlie Kenton. This is Max.

715
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:51,390
Kingpin. Call me Kingpin.

716
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:54,088
- All right, Kingpin, so...
- How much a round?

717
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,892
We on a field trip?

718
00:58:58,067 --> 00:59:00,467
All right. He can fight my robot Metro.

719
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:02,367
I'll give you a hundred bucks
for one two-minute round.

720
00:59:02,471 --> 00:59:03,904
- Take it.
- Three hundred.

721
00:59:04,006 --> 00:59:07,498
One hundred. Baby boy, I'm going to
give you $100 just to get in with Metro.

722
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:10,275
How about 500 for two rounds?

723
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:14,946
Two rounds. Son, he ain't
going to survive one round.

724
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:17,485
- What if he does?
- He ain't.

725
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:20,212
Let's just say he does.

726
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:25,389
If he's still standing after one round...

727
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:28,090
...I'll give you a thousand bucks.

728
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:29,289
Shut it!

729
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:36,635
But if he dies in there,
which he will, junior...

730
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:41,009
...I get to keep what's left.

731
00:59:42,578 --> 00:59:44,011
Take the hundred.

732
00:59:44,513 --> 00:59:45,571
Deal.

733
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:49,246
We're on. We on!

734
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:53,545
Let's go!

735
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:56,022
- You should have taken the hundred.
- I got us a thousand.

736
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:57,422
Yeah, if he wins.

737
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:24,685
You want me to drive?

738
01:00:24,987 --> 01:00:26,420
He's my bot. I got this!

739
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:29,719
This ain't a video game.
This is for real. Right here.

740
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:33,189
You said he's coming home in pieces.
What difference does it make?

741
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,456
All right.

742
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:37,524
I got this.

743
01:00:37,633 --> 01:00:40,033
Let's get it on! Let's get it on!

744
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:43,697
Let's get it on like
Ping-Pong in Hong Kong!

745
01:00:44,006 --> 01:00:46,566
Give me a bell! Give me a bell!

746
01:00:58,621 --> 01:01:01,146
Don't watch Atom. Watch your opponent.

747
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:03,487
Watch out for that foot.
He's looking to pin you.

748
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:07,455
I told you to watch for that foot plant.
Come on.

749
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:11,027
Here comes the sledgehammer.

750
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:17,232
Did you see that?

751
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,605
- Come on! Get him!
- Don't yell at him, control him.

752
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:22,610
Slip right. Back step.

753
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:24,505
Duck.

754
01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:27,081
- You're welcome.
- Shut up! You're not helping!

755
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:28,207
Actually, I think I am.

756
01:01:29,618 --> 01:01:34,453
Backhand. You got speed on this guy.
Just keep moving. Bob.

757
01:01:40,262 --> 01:01:43,095
Slip out of that corner.
Keep moving! Bob and weave!

758
01:01:44,066 --> 01:01:47,229
That's it! Now you're listening to me.

759
01:01:57,279 --> 01:02:00,476
He can take a hit. I'll give you this.
Your bot can take a hit.

760
01:02:03,085 --> 01:02:05,383
You better slip that headlock.
This ain't gonna end well for you.

761
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:06,512
I'm trying!

762
01:02:13,295 --> 01:02:15,456
Thirty seconds!

763
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,596
Thirty... Half a minute.

764
01:02:19,668 --> 01:02:22,330
Half a minute! Keep moving! Just move!

765
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:27,237
You've got 20 seconds!

766
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:31,274
That's a thousand bucks.
Twenty seconds. Let me take over!

767
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:33,139
Move, then. Move!

768
01:02:40,222 --> 01:02:41,553
Come on.

769
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:43,591
Get up, Atom. Get up, Atom.

770
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:48,263
Count with me! Count with me! One!

771
01:02:48,364 --> 01:02:51,561
- Get up!
- You know you're talking to a machine?

772
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:54,192
Four! Five! Six!

773
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:55,702
Get up, Atom!

774
01:02:55,805 --> 01:02:58,330
All the way up! All the way up!

775
01:03:00,876 --> 01:03:02,776
Yes! Yes!

776
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:09,181
I'm going to fix it!

777
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:13,186
I'm going to fix it! Come on, now.

778
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:14,688
- This thousand bucks...
- Yeah, thousand.

779
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:16,621
...double or nothing
he can't make another round.

780
01:03:16,725 --> 01:03:18,420
- Yeah, thanks anyway.
- Deal. Double or nothing.

781
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:20,859
Baby boy said it! We're back on! We on!

782
01:03:21,163 --> 01:03:23,461
Are you crazy?
You threw away a thousand bucks!

783
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:25,591
He can barely stand up in there.

784
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:28,397
Look. I really need the money.

785
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:31,739
I know. Let's work.

786
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:34,500
Jesus.

787
01:03:40,182 --> 01:03:42,275
- Watch that. Watch that.
- I got that.

788
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:57,922
- I got it.
- That's a system failure!

789
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:01,365
- I don't got it.
- He's going down.

790
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:07,968
- Yes!
- No!

791
01:04:10,212 --> 01:04:11,736
Start the count!

792
01:04:11,847 --> 01:04:13,246
Start the count!

793
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:16,785
One! Two! Three!

794
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:20,913
Four! Five! Six! Seven!

795
01:04:21,223 --> 01:04:22,918
Eight! Nine!

796
01:04:23,225 --> 01:04:24,249
Ten!

797
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:28,594
You did it! We did it! Wow!

798
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:36,498
Time to go. Come on. Grab your robot.

799
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:41,265
I know, I know! I know! I know!

800
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:42,901
Kingpin, pay up.

801
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:46,272
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know, I know, I know.

802
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:48,748
- We owned!
- Let's go. Come on, come on.

803
01:04:49,985 --> 01:04:51,816
- Yeah?
- Have I got a fight for you.

804
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:56,517
Saturday night. Guaranteed four grand.
Seven if he wins.

805
01:04:56,625 --> 01:04:58,559
Four grand? You're on. Let's go!

806
01:05:07,836 --> 01:05:11,033
Bailey, it's me. He won.

807
01:05:12,274 --> 01:05:14,435
Can you believe that?
The kid's robot actually won.

808
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:17,539
I know.

809
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:22,275
Happy? Oh, my God. Yeah.

810
01:05:22,384 --> 01:05:24,750
He's been bit. He's been bit real bad.

811
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:29,581
Anyway...

812
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:33,590
I just wanted you to know.

813
01:06:07,563 --> 01:06:09,463
Jab, jab, hook.

814
01:06:12,968 --> 01:06:14,663
Jab, jab, hook.

815
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:19,369
I think you have to move your feet.

816
01:06:21,877 --> 01:06:25,904
Your feet. Feet.

817
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:47,193
Nice moves, kid.

818
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:50,862
How long you been out here?

819
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,427
Check it out.

820
01:07:53,535 --> 01:07:55,833
I just spent the night
doing something I think is amazing.

821
01:07:55,938 --> 01:07:57,872
Incredibly amazing.
If it works, you know?

822
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:00,937
- You know his remote was spotty?
- Yeah.

823
01:08:01,043 --> 01:08:04,137
I killed it. Got rid of it.
We don't need it anymore.

824
01:08:04,446 --> 01:08:05,606
How did you?

825
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:07,979
I had to start over.

826
01:08:08,083 --> 01:08:10,779
But I was able to use
the spin frame from Ambush

827
01:08:10,886 --> 01:08:13,548
and take the circuitry sleeve
out of Noisy Boy,

828
01:08:13,655 --> 01:08:14,713
and it works.

829
01:08:14,823 --> 01:08:17,917
He knows nothing, but it works.
It really, really works.

830
01:08:18,026 --> 01:08:19,118
What works?

831
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:22,026
I got to turn it on.

832
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:26,133
Left jab, right uppercut!

833
01:08:28,203 --> 01:08:29,227
Japan!

834
01:08:29,538 --> 01:08:32,006
You put Noisy's voice recognition
into Atom?

835
01:08:32,107 --> 01:08:34,200
- Pretty smart, kid.
- Smart?

836
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:35,772
It could be genius!

837
01:08:35,878 --> 01:08:38,642
It could be the most incredible thing
in the history of the entire world!

838
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:41,773
Easy there, chief.
Did you drink all these sodas?

839
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:44,944
I might have had a few.
I need you to teach him to box.

840
01:08:45,053 --> 01:08:49,080
Are you kidding me? He's not advanced
enough to handle Noisy's voice command.

841
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:51,489
So he needs your moves. Your commands.

842
01:08:51,593 --> 01:08:54,027
- Start over from the ground up.
- Forget it.

843
01:08:54,129 --> 01:08:55,926
You were a boxer.

844
01:08:56,031 --> 01:09:00,627
Yesterday at the Zoo, you could see
things happen before they even happened.

845
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:02,966
I haven't boxed in a long time.
I'm not starting now.

846
01:09:03,071 --> 01:09:05,631
- Who's going to teach him to fight?
- You're doing fine.

847
01:09:05,741 --> 01:09:07,641
You don't need me. Sorry.

848
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:13,939
That was really cool,
though, that dance.

849
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:17,047
You should do that on Saturday night.

850
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,947
- Don't make fun of me.
- I'm serious.

851
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:22,888
Before the fight, when you guys
take the ring, you should do it.

852
01:09:22,991 --> 01:09:26,222
There's no way I'm dancing with a robot
in front of a boxing crowd.

853
01:09:26,528 --> 01:09:29,725
Are you kidding me? This is just a show.

854
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:31,993
People want to see something
they've never seen.

855
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:34,796
Look. You think of all the greats.

856
01:09:34,903 --> 01:09:37,701
Think Ali, Sugar Ray,
Prince Rakim, Gammer,

857
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:39,603
they all had their nicknames.

858
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:42,734
They had their personas.
They all had flair.

859
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:47,248
Now you? You might not have much robot,
but with that dance, you got flair.

860
01:09:47,549 --> 01:09:50,814
Plus, you're a kid.
People love that kid thing.

861
01:09:50,919 --> 01:09:53,717
- What are you? Like nine? Ten?
- I'm 11.

862
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:55,585
Are you sure you're 11?

863
01:09:56,558 --> 01:09:58,822
Yes. I'm sure I'm 11.

864
01:09:59,962 --> 01:10:03,125
Anyway, the point
is people want to see that.

865
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:08,732
You're really not messing with me?

866
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:11,169
I am not messing with you.
They're going to love it.

867
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:16,170
- Cool.
- But...

868
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:19,304
- What?
- I won't do it unless you help me.

869
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:23,581
I can't dance. You're on your own there.

870
01:10:23,685 --> 01:10:25,277
No. Boxing.

871
01:10:25,587 --> 01:10:26,884
- Oh, I see.
- I program the robot.

872
01:10:26,989 --> 01:10:29,150
- You teach him to box.
- And you dance.

873
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:30,748
And you dance.

874
01:10:32,995 --> 01:10:34,155
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

875
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:35,287
Deal.

876
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:38,624
Deal.

877
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:43,067
It's going to be cool.

878
01:11:37,993 --> 01:11:39,324
Nice.

879
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:44,063
You're going to be punching guys bigger.
You're going to have to punch up.

880
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:45,958
That's it.

881
01:11:47,035 --> 01:11:48,059
Nice.

882
01:11:53,742 --> 01:11:55,107
You, too, old man?

883
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:58,112
Come on. Let's get to work.

884
01:12:00,882 --> 01:12:02,975
Nice! Let's do that again.

885
01:12:04,753 --> 01:12:06,846
Nice. Three-punch combo.

886
01:12:08,223 --> 01:12:09,247
Combo.

887
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:12,059
Again. Again.

888
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:16,690
Faster. Faster. Nice.

889
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:20,294
You're not even out of breath.
I like it.

890
01:12:21,069 --> 01:12:22,366
Let's see how you move.

891
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:30,402
That's good.

892
01:13:06,314 --> 01:13:08,874
Step around! Left hook! Left hook!

893
01:13:25,233 --> 01:13:27,201
That's it. Every time.

894
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:37,770
Upper cut!

895
01:13:45,253 --> 01:13:46,550
Great fight, fellas.

896
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:58,126
105.5, WRUT,
the satellite home of robot boxing.

897
01:13:58,233 --> 01:13:59,996
Caller two, what do you got for me?

898
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:02,229
Have you heard about this little bot
out there, his name is Atom?

899
01:14:02,337 --> 01:14:03,361
Oh, yeah.

900
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:06,100
My buddies and I saw him
the other night, and he dances.

901
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:08,176
- Did you say "dances"?
- You heard me.

902
01:14:08,276 --> 01:14:10,403
He dances pre-fight
with this little kid,

903
01:14:10,512 --> 01:14:12,070
and the crowd went nuts for these two.

904
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:15,013
You put the gimmick aside
for a second,

905
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,585
and I'm holding here a list
of the bots he's beaten.

906
01:14:17,886 --> 01:14:22,380
Chaos. Wall Street. One-Eyed Jack.
No slouches on that list, right?

907
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:24,322
Atom's fought them all, beat them all.

908
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:28,556
This bot is fast! He escapes shots
from these bigger bots, it's insane!

909
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:31,856
No doubt. I'm telling you, listeners,
remember this name:

910
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:36,836
Atom. That's right, A-T-O-M.
This bot is one to watch.

911
01:14:42,077 --> 01:14:44,375
- Awesome fight, sir.
- Thanks, thanks.

912
01:14:44,479 --> 01:14:46,276
Great fight.

913
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:48,008
- You guys put on a good show.
- Thanks.

914
01:14:48,116 --> 01:14:50,050
We'd like to invite you
to fight on our card,

915
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:52,211
Virgin America Spectrum Detroit,
Friday night.

916
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:55,881
Right. That's a WRB...
That's a League fight.

917
01:14:55,991 --> 01:15:00,052
Damn right it is. What do you say,
fellas? You ready for the show?

918
01:15:01,596 --> 01:15:03,063
Heck, yeah.

919
01:15:11,573 --> 01:15:14,565
It's the undercard,
but it's still a League fight.

920
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:18,570
I just want you to be relaxed.
I want you to be relaxed.

921
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:21,576
No freaking out.
Don't get all freaky-deaky on me.

922
01:15:21,883 --> 01:15:24,078
You go freaky-deaky,
this whole thing can go south.

923
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:28,054
Whatever you do, have fun, have fun.
You got to have fun, you understand me?

924
01:15:28,156 --> 01:15:32,183
We've come too far to get out there
and freak out and blow this whole thing.

925
01:15:32,294 --> 01:15:35,593
We're going to have fun,
and we're going to not freak out!

926
01:15:35,897 --> 01:15:39,230
We're going to stay loose,
and we're just going to bam him.

927
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:42,599
I've spent my whole life waiting
to get here. We're going to...

928
01:15:43,538 --> 01:15:47,269
I tell you what. Trust me when
I say no freaking out. You got it?

929
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:50,201
- I got it.
- Good.

930
01:15:50,912 --> 01:15:55,178
You have been invited to Lemkova Suite.
Follow me, please.

931
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:57,913
What was that? One more time.

932
01:15:58,019 --> 01:16:00,453
Lemkova Suite. Zeus Suite.

933
01:16:01,156 --> 01:16:04,057
Sure. Yeah. Let's head up
to the champ's suite. Sure.

934
01:16:33,521 --> 01:16:34,613
Wow.

935
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:38,723
- Gentlemen, I'm Farra Lemkova.
- Yeah. I'm Charlie Kenton, and...

936
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:41,018
And this, of course, is Tak Mashido.

937
01:16:41,129 --> 01:16:43,393
Holy shit. It's Tak Mashido.

938
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:47,630
I know you have a very important fight
tonight, so I'll get right to it.

939
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:51,372
It's a little far from the action for
my liking. It's nice. I like it, though.

940
01:16:51,473 --> 01:16:55,409
Very nicely... Wow. That's a great shot.

941
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:57,671
Look at that. You want an autograph?
Would you mind?

942
01:16:57,979 --> 01:16:59,708
I'd like to buy your robot.

943
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:06,350
He'd be useful sparring bot for Zeus.
And for that I'm willing to pay.

944
01:17:07,389 --> 01:17:10,483
$200,000.

945
01:17:10,592 --> 01:17:12,150
- Done.
- He's not for sale.

946
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:14,990
- Of course he is. We can definitely...
- He's not for sale.

947
01:17:15,597 --> 01:17:20,591
You are 15 minutes away from getting
in the ring with Twin Cities,

948
01:17:20,702 --> 01:17:22,636
a vicious League bot.

949
01:17:22,737 --> 01:17:28,175
So, to be clear, my offer stands
until the starting bell.

950
01:17:28,276 --> 01:17:32,440
OK. And just to be clear,
he's not for sale!

951
01:17:32,547 --> 01:17:34,674
Not now, not ever.

952
01:17:36,017 --> 01:17:38,178
Give me a minute to clear this up, OK?

953
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:41,178
Tak, how are you? Max!

954
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:45,616
Be smart. I know you love him,

955
01:17:45,727 --> 01:17:48,321
but in 20 minutes
there may be nothing left to love.

956
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:51,524
- Think about it. Take the offer.
- You think about it.

957
01:17:52,267 --> 01:17:55,759
Why does she want Atom?
Because he's different from other bots!

958
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:58,039
Yeah, he's different.
He's smaller, weaker,

959
01:17:58,139 --> 01:18:00,266
- and he's going to get his ass kicked.
- He's a boxer.

960
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:02,672
We taught him to box.
You taught him to box!

961
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:05,379
- That's worth something.
- I think it is, too.

962
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:09,143
I think it's worth 200 grand.
Two hundred grand.

963
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:12,219
We can go round and round this
all night long.

964
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,617
Look at me.

965
01:18:15,023 --> 01:18:16,320
But it's not going to happen.

966
01:18:17,459 --> 01:18:18,756
I got a fight to get to.

967
01:18:33,408 --> 01:18:37,310
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight,

968
01:18:37,412 --> 01:18:42,179
the march towards
the Real Steel Championship

969
01:18:42,283 --> 01:18:45,343
makes its way through Detroit's

970
01:18:45,453 --> 01:18:49,514
Virgin America Spectrum!

971
01:18:53,495 --> 01:18:57,829
Kicking off the evening,
in our first undercard,

972
01:18:58,133 --> 01:19:00,863
the two-headed tyrant,

973
01:19:01,169 --> 01:19:05,401
Twin Cities!

974
01:19:35,804 --> 01:19:41,140
Opposing Twin Cities,
in his first professional fight,

975
01:19:41,242 --> 01:19:44,700
hailing from parts unknown,

976
01:19:44,813 --> 01:19:46,576
Atom!

977
01:20:42,303 --> 01:20:43,702
- Nice work, boss.
- Thanks.

978
01:20:43,805 --> 01:20:45,670
- Did you switch him to fight mode?
- Of course.

979
01:20:45,773 --> 01:20:48,537
- This bot is tough to put down.
- Atom can do it.

980
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:52,537
Look over there. You see those geeks
with the joysticks and consoles?

981
01:20:52,647 --> 01:20:54,444
They're controlling
everything their bot does.

982
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:55,709
They're monitoring his systems,

983
01:20:55,817 --> 01:20:58,411
seeing what he sees,
stadium feeds of the fights.

984
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,579
This is not like the underground
handheld remote bots

985
01:21:00,688 --> 01:21:02,588
we've been fighting.
This is the League. Stand on that.

986
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:04,658
So what do we do?

987
01:21:05,426 --> 01:21:08,918
We fight smart, we be patient. And pray.

988
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:12,295
Seriously, pray.

989
01:21:14,769 --> 01:21:15,793
Ready!

990
01:21:16,938 --> 01:21:18,803
- Ready!
- Hands up.

991
01:21:18,907 --> 01:21:21,341
Fighters ready! Fight!

992
01:21:24,913 --> 01:21:26,278
Engage.

993
01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:32,646
Slip! Right! Lean back.
Right, left! Cover up!

994
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:37,280
Duck! Left roundhouse!

995
01:21:39,928 --> 01:21:41,395
Damn it.

996
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:52,401
Lean left! Lean right!
Cover up! Cover up!

997
01:21:52,507 --> 01:21:55,442
- What's going on in there?
- He's taking too many hits.

998
01:22:01,349 --> 01:22:02,577
Get your hands up!

999
01:22:05,453 --> 01:22:07,318
Get out of that corner! Move!

1000
01:22:10,358 --> 01:22:12,724
He's getting killed in there!
Tell him what to do!

1001
01:22:12,827 --> 01:22:15,660
That guy's got two heads, a foot
of reach on us, and no blind spot.

1002
01:22:15,763 --> 01:22:17,628
He's got to have a weakness. Find it!

1003
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:24,833
Wait, wait, wait.

1004
01:22:25,573 --> 01:22:28,474
Right shoulder, right shoulder,
right shoulder! He's got a tell!

1005
01:22:28,576 --> 01:22:31,010
He's got a hitch in his shoulder
every time he throws that right bomb!

1006
01:22:31,312 --> 01:22:33,473
We got him!
See? Here it comes again!

1007
01:22:33,581 --> 01:22:36,345
Duck! Spin!
Slide left! Roundhouse! One, two!

1008
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:39,648
Backstep. Backstep.
Backstep. Lean right.

1009
01:22:39,754 --> 01:22:41,779
Come on, Charlie! Get in there!

1010
01:22:41,889 --> 01:22:44,483
Got to get in close where
he can't use that size and reach on us!

1011
01:22:44,592 --> 01:22:47,755
Left to the body! Right to the body!
Left to the body!

1012
01:22:47,862 --> 01:22:49,352
Yeah, it's working!

1013
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:51,364
Stay downstairs! Left, right, left!

1014
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,667
- These program modes aren't working.
- Left! Right hook, slip!

1015
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:59,433
Right uppercut! Left uppercut!
Duck left. Counter right!

1016
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:02,100
- Get him, Atom!
- Here comes the Charlie Special.

1017
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:05,379
Three-punch combo to the body!
Out! In! Counter!

1018
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,380
- Two-one-two!
- Two-one-two.

1019
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:08,915
Stay on him! Lunging right!

1020
01:23:11,786 --> 01:23:14,516
Don't let him go. Right to the body!
Straight right to the head!

1021
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:20,961
We got a systems crash!

1022
01:23:21,062 --> 01:23:22,586
Get him, Atom!

1023
01:23:25,767 --> 01:23:27,064
This is not happening, man.

1024
01:23:27,368 --> 01:23:29,563
- Put him away, Charlie!
- Spin left!

1025
01:23:30,571 --> 01:23:31,833
Spin right!

1026
01:23:34,042 --> 01:23:35,066
Finish him!

1027
01:23:35,376 --> 01:23:37,401
- Do it!
- Right uppercut!

1028
01:23:47,622 --> 01:23:48,714
He's down!

1029
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:52,990
One! Two! Three!

1030
01:23:53,094 --> 01:23:55,995
Four! Five! Six!

1031
01:23:56,097 --> 01:23:58,088
We got him. Stay down!

1032
01:24:00,601 --> 01:24:02,000
He's out! He's out!

1033
01:24:07,975 --> 01:24:09,067
Yeah!

1034
01:24:12,046 --> 01:24:13,877
Corner!

1035
01:24:13,981 --> 01:24:16,973
Corner! Corner.

1036
01:24:18,686 --> 01:24:19,880
Victory!

1037
01:24:21,089 --> 01:24:25,423
In a time of one minute, 47 seconds

1038
01:24:25,526 --> 01:24:27,892
of the first round,

1039
01:24:27,995 --> 01:24:29,724
Atom has defeat...

1040
01:24:30,832 --> 01:24:33,630
I want to thank everyone
for coming out tonight!

1041
01:24:36,170 --> 01:24:40,470
Our little bot from the junkyard
got a shot at a League fight.

1042
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:41,872
How about that?

1043
01:24:43,077 --> 01:24:47,741
And the last thing I want to say
to a special girl who won't be named,

1044
01:24:47,849 --> 01:24:49,749
Farra Lemkova.

1045
01:24:54,055 --> 01:24:57,821
That instead of buying my robot, using
your money to control this sport...

1046
01:24:57,925 --> 01:24:59,756
- That's it!
- I'm not done.

1047
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:02,489
Why not give the littlest guy
the biggest shot?

1048
01:25:02,997 --> 01:25:06,899
Because I bet if you give him a shot,
he'll surprise you!

1049
01:25:07,001 --> 01:25:08,593
Wouldn't you like to see a little guy

1050
01:25:08,703 --> 01:25:10,728
get a shot at the
Real Steel Championship?

1051
01:25:14,742 --> 01:25:18,178
I challenge Zeus to a fight.

1052
01:25:20,214 --> 01:25:24,207
Any time, any place, anywhere!

1053
01:25:24,519 --> 01:25:27,511
You name it! We will be there!

1054
01:25:35,163 --> 01:25:37,131
I'm going to get us that fight!

1055
01:25:41,035 --> 01:25:44,061
Atom, Atom, Atom...

1056
01:25:56,951 --> 01:25:59,215
That was a ballsy move,
you challenging Zeus like that.

1057
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:00,885
That's one thing to call it.

1058
01:26:00,988 --> 01:26:02,250
A lot of people would like to see that.

1059
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:05,253
- You're damn right they would.
- You listening to this kid? Jeez!

1060
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:07,255
- Good fight, fellas.
- Thanks, man.

1061
01:26:07,562 --> 01:26:09,223
- Look at this. Let's celebrate.
- Yeah.

1062
01:26:09,530 --> 01:26:12,658
- All right, 70-30, right?
- Yeah, 70 for me and 30 for you.

1063
01:26:12,767 --> 01:26:14,257
- That's so right.
- That's very funny.

1064
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:18,630
- I told you we shouldn't have sold him.
- OK. No, no, no.

1065
01:26:18,739 --> 01:26:22,903
I remember now. Who's right?
Say who's right. Say "Max is right."

1066
01:26:23,010 --> 01:26:24,978
All right, all right. All right.

1067
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:28,674
- We're a good team.
- No, no. Max is right.

1068
01:26:28,916 --> 01:26:31,214
That was unbelievable.
Thank you, Twin Cities.

1069
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:35,121
- We set?
- Yeah.

1070
01:26:35,223 --> 01:26:37,589
- Let's do it.
- Charlie boy.

1071
01:26:38,559 --> 01:26:41,858
- Ricky, I was just going to call you.
- Oh, yeah.

1072
01:26:41,963 --> 01:26:44,830
I actually really was going to call you.

1073
01:26:44,966 --> 01:26:46,763
Don't worry about that.

1074
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:48,893
That was a heck of a fight.

1075
01:26:49,003 --> 01:26:51,267
Congratulations to both of you.
That was good.

1076
01:26:51,572 --> 01:26:54,268
It was an amazing fight.
That was a great job, young man.

1077
01:26:55,243 --> 01:26:56,733
- Come on, man.
- What?

1078
01:26:56,844 --> 01:27:00,974
- You serious?
- You thought I was joking

1079
01:27:01,082 --> 01:27:02,879
when I said I'd beat you
within an inch of your life?

1080
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:06,078
He thought that was a joke.
It wasn't a joke.

1081
01:27:06,187 --> 01:27:10,351
I got a kid here. And I have your money.
We don't have a problem.

1082
01:27:10,658 --> 01:27:13,183
I'm sure you do,

1083
01:27:13,294 --> 01:27:16,320
but I think we know it's about
much more than money, don't we?

1084
01:27:16,631 --> 01:27:21,796
All right. What do you want?
You want 25, 30? You want 30 grand?

1085
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:23,666
- I got the money in cash here.
- Yeah, right.

1086
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:26,899
Let's go! Max, go! Go, go! Run!

1087
01:27:27,008 --> 01:27:30,307
- Run! Come on. Keep up, keep up!
- Get him now!

1088
01:27:30,611 --> 01:27:31,873
Run! Come on!

1089
01:27:33,748 --> 01:27:35,375
Get off him! Get off him!

1090
01:27:38,819 --> 01:27:39,843
Come here!

1091
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:45,250
Hey, Ricky.

1092
01:27:45,359 --> 01:27:47,020
That's his money!
Leave him out of this!

1093
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:01,331
Stop!

1094
01:28:03,844 --> 01:28:05,106
Stop!

1095
01:28:05,212 --> 01:28:08,841
Take all his money. Take it all.

1096
01:28:11,352 --> 01:28:13,912
Your friend's a real dirtbag, kid.

1097
01:28:14,021 --> 01:28:15,682
He's my father!

1098
01:28:17,825 --> 01:28:22,660
Well. Looks like a little less
than an inch of your life.

1099
01:28:22,763 --> 01:28:25,425
Well, buddy, that will teach him.

1100
01:28:31,072 --> 01:28:34,007
Just like old times, Charlie boy!

1101
01:28:34,108 --> 01:28:35,370
Let's go, boys.

1102
01:29:01,302 --> 01:29:05,432
I'm sorry, Max. I'm sorry. Sorry.

1103
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:47,911
- What are we doing here?
- Max, just...

1104
01:29:48,015 --> 01:29:51,109
Is it Farra? She called you, didn't she?
We're going to get the Zeus fight.

1105
01:29:51,218 --> 01:29:55,382
It's not the Zeus people. I've been
thinking about all this, and...

1106
01:29:57,425 --> 01:29:58,517
Max!

1107
01:30:08,235 --> 01:30:10,066
It's so good to see you.

1108
01:30:10,171 --> 01:30:12,765
- What is she doing here?
- It's better if you go with her now.

1109
01:30:12,873 --> 01:30:14,932
We get beat up,
so you call her to come and get me?

1110
01:30:15,042 --> 01:30:16,942
He's been beat up. I told you
he couldn't take care of him!

1111
01:30:17,044 --> 01:30:19,842
Yeah. I called her.
Look at us. We're a mess.

1112
01:30:19,947 --> 01:30:21,972
We're fine. She can leave!

1113
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:25,109
Atom's fighting good.
We can make the money back.

1114
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,820
Charlie, please.

1115
01:30:28,856 --> 01:30:29,948
Just...

1116
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:35,328
Charlie, we're doing so good.

1117
01:30:37,264 --> 01:30:39,232
Charlie, please, no.

1118
01:30:40,501 --> 01:30:43,163
Don't. Don't. Don't.

1119
01:30:44,171 --> 01:30:47,106
Please. Please.

1120
01:30:51,779 --> 01:30:54,873
Trust me, kid.
It's better this way, all right?

1121
01:30:55,516 --> 01:30:58,383
I know you think you know
what's right, but you don't.

1122
01:30:58,486 --> 01:31:00,147
You're too young. You don't know.

1123
01:31:00,254 --> 01:31:01,915
Look at me, trust me.

1124
01:31:02,022 --> 01:31:05,253
And legally she has custody,
so what can I do?

1125
01:31:06,227 --> 01:31:08,058
What can I do?

1126
01:31:23,310 --> 01:31:25,005
I don't want your money, Marvin.

1127
01:31:26,113 --> 01:31:28,206
Max, we have our own swimming pool

1128
01:31:28,315 --> 01:31:33,014
and we have a hot tub and a lot
of super fun toys to play with.

1129
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,884
Do you want to play with them?
It's going to be fun.

1130
01:31:36,590 --> 01:31:38,080
What's going on?

1131
01:31:38,192 --> 01:31:40,956
He won't even talk to me,
so thanks for that, Charlie.

1132
01:31:41,996 --> 01:31:43,429
I'm going to wait in the car.

1133
01:31:46,133 --> 01:31:48,601
You don't want to talk, fine. I'll talk.

1134
01:31:48,903 --> 01:31:50,871
What do you want me to say? I'm sorry?

1135
01:31:50,971 --> 01:31:54,031
You knew from day one what this was.

1136
01:31:54,141 --> 01:31:56,006
You decided to take the ride.

1137
01:31:56,510 --> 01:32:00,378
You thought me, you,
and a little robot from the junk heap

1138
01:32:00,548 --> 01:32:03,039
were going to ride off into the sunset?

1139
01:32:05,085 --> 01:32:07,485
No, you forgot who I was!

1140
01:32:13,561 --> 01:32:15,051
You deserve better...

1141
01:32:16,463 --> 01:32:17,555
...than me.

1142
01:32:22,136 --> 01:32:23,933
Will you say something, please?

1143
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:26,472
I tried. What do you want from me?

1144
01:32:26,574 --> 01:32:28,337
I want you to fight for me.

1145
01:32:29,543 --> 01:32:31,408
That's all I ever wanted.

1146
01:34:36,570 --> 01:34:38,060
Don't ask.

1147
01:34:40,174 --> 01:34:41,607
So no Max.

1148
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:46,605
It's better this way.
Marv and Debra have money. Max is set.

1149
01:34:46,714 --> 01:34:48,545
Did you not see the way
he looked at you?

1150
01:34:49,717 --> 01:34:52,049
That's the way I looked at my dad.

1151
01:34:52,152 --> 01:34:54,347
Even now I would give anything
to have that back.

1152
01:34:54,455 --> 01:34:58,516
Your dad was special.
He was in your corner from day one.

1153
01:34:59,493 --> 01:35:01,290
Me, come on. I blew it.

1154
01:35:03,197 --> 01:35:04,562
I blew it.

1155
01:35:05,466 --> 01:35:07,400
When Max was born I just...

1156
01:35:08,102 --> 01:35:09,501
...freaked out.

1157
01:35:09,603 --> 01:35:11,798
But something
would have been better than nothing.

1158
01:35:12,106 --> 01:35:13,368
I wouldn't know where to start.

1159
01:35:13,474 --> 01:35:14,498
- Yeah, you do.
- I don't.

1160
01:35:14,608 --> 01:35:16,235
- You do.
- No.

1161
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:18,303
You do.

1162
01:35:51,245 --> 01:35:52,337
I got to go.

1163
01:35:55,382 --> 01:35:56,849
Twelve hundred miles for a kiss.

1164
01:35:58,452 --> 01:36:00,852
Worth it. Worth it.

1165
01:36:12,299 --> 01:36:13,789
Go get him, Charlie.

1166
01:36:17,271 --> 01:36:18,636
You sound like your dad.

1167
01:36:46,867 --> 01:36:50,701
Look, I know you think I abandoned you,

1168
01:36:50,804 --> 01:36:53,671
and I guess I did originally.

1169
01:36:53,774 --> 01:36:54,798
Then you sold me.

1170
01:36:55,509 --> 01:36:56,635
Charlie.

1171
01:36:57,711 --> 01:36:59,679
You have no business being here.

1172
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:02,340
That's true.
You've got full custody. He's yours.

1173
01:37:02,449 --> 01:37:06,385
And I know I've done all kinds of wrong
by this kid, but if you'll let me...

1174
01:37:08,455 --> 01:37:10,480
...I'd just like to do one thing right.

1175
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:14,518
Right.

1176
01:37:16,196 --> 01:37:17,823
- Where were we?
- You sold me.

1177
01:37:17,931 --> 01:37:20,229
Right, yeah, that happened.

1178
01:37:20,334 --> 01:37:22,529
- Wait, what?
- Then we had our asses kicked.

1179
01:37:22,636 --> 01:37:24,797
And you slept on a shelf in a truck,
and it was awful.

1180
01:37:24,905 --> 01:37:26,634
- And dangerous.
- Really dangerous.

1181
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:30,608
I mean, I know. God. I'm sorry.

1182
01:37:31,678 --> 01:37:34,670
That's why you came?
To say you're sorry?

1183
01:37:34,781 --> 01:37:37,272
No. I mean, yes. Yes.

1184
01:37:40,287 --> 01:37:43,848
But no. No, I came to tell you
that I heard you.

1185
01:37:44,825 --> 01:37:48,317
I got it.
I'm a little slow, but I got it.

1186
01:37:49,763 --> 01:37:53,358
I know you had a bum ride, and I
wasn't there and I should have been.

1187
01:37:54,601 --> 01:37:55,659
I should have been.

1188
01:37:56,870 --> 01:37:58,394
Your mom was...

1189
01:37:58,906 --> 01:38:00,771
She was cool, wasn't she?

1190
01:38:02,342 --> 01:38:03,400
She was.

1191
01:38:04,278 --> 01:38:05,575
She was the coolest.

1192
01:38:06,413 --> 01:38:08,938
Yeah, she was.

1193
01:38:11,818 --> 01:38:16,812
And I'm sorry about...
what happened with her.

1194
01:38:20,227 --> 01:38:22,855
And I can't get those years back, Max,

1195
01:38:22,963 --> 01:38:26,262
but I'm here right now...

1196
01:38:27,634 --> 01:38:30,899
...and if you're up for it,
I'm ready to fight.

1197
01:38:44,851 --> 01:38:46,580
We got the Zeus fight.

1198
01:38:46,687 --> 01:38:47,847
What?

1199
01:38:47,955 --> 01:38:49,855
No, no, we didn't.

1200
01:38:50,757 --> 01:38:52,782
You got the Zeus fight.

1201
01:38:56,697 --> 01:38:58,631
So what do you say, Debra?

1202
01:38:58,732 --> 01:39:00,290
Can we do this one last thing?

1203
01:39:03,670 --> 01:39:06,298
- One night.
- It's all we need. Thank you.

1204
01:39:11,345 --> 01:39:14,974
We'll probably get our asses kicked,
but at least we'll go down swinging.

1205
01:39:15,849 --> 01:39:17,976
Yeah? What do you say?

1206
01:39:20,287 --> 01:39:24,621
Welcome to New York's Bing Arena
and the Real Steel Championship Bout.

1207
01:39:24,725 --> 01:39:27,023
Tim, it's the fight
we never thought we'd see.

1208
01:39:27,327 --> 01:39:29,522
Zeus, the undefeated WRB champion,

1209
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:32,895
against the underdog, rising star Atom.

1210
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,900
The champ's handlers
have agreed to fight

1211
01:39:35,002 --> 01:39:37,664
outside the circle
of well-known League bots,

1212
01:39:37,771 --> 01:39:41,901
and have decided to give the people
a true David versus Goliath spectacle.

1213
01:39:42,009 --> 01:39:45,536
Now, Tim, help me out on this.
Has the Zeus camp lost their mind?

1214
01:39:45,646 --> 01:39:47,409
The greatest robot boxer of all time

1215
01:39:47,514 --> 01:39:50,506
gives a shot at the belt
to a G-2 named Atom?

1216
01:39:50,617 --> 01:39:54,553
Well, Herb, if you ask Tak Mashido,
Team Zeus has lost their minds.

1217
01:39:54,655 --> 01:39:56,919
Now, he may look cool
as he enters the arena,

1218
01:39:57,024 --> 01:40:00,050
but he has made no bones
about his disdain for this matchup.

1219
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:02,988
Our cameras tried to catch up
with him earlier this week.

1220
01:40:03,096 --> 01:40:06,088
Look at this clip. Mashido wouldn't
even stop to talk to the press,

1221
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,563
referring only to this fight
as an insult to his creation.

1222
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:13,538
Now, Max Kenton, Atom's trainer,
did more than just challenge Zeus.

1223
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:14,868
He did so publicly.

1224
01:40:14,975 --> 01:40:18,672
The challenge went viral and created
a PR nightmare for the champ.

1225
01:40:18,779 --> 01:40:22,442
No argument there. And I think the Zeus
camp knows exactly what they're doing.

1226
01:40:22,549 --> 01:40:23,982
That they do. Come on.

1227
01:40:24,084 --> 01:40:27,110
Giving a shot at the belt
to a nobody from nowhere.

1228
01:40:27,421 --> 01:40:30,515
This "junkyard dog," if you will.
That's a marketing stunt.

1229
01:40:30,624 --> 01:40:33,422
And judging from this crowd,
that stunt is working.

1230
01:40:47,674 --> 01:40:49,039
We can't win, can we?

1231
01:40:50,077 --> 01:40:51,169
We'll see.

1232
01:40:55,549 --> 01:40:57,744
As the challenger
makes his way into the arena,

1233
01:40:57,851 --> 01:41:00,046
you can hear the surge of excitement.

1234
01:41:11,565 --> 01:41:14,864
Atom has arrived
onto the WRB scene with a vengeance,

1235
01:41:14,968 --> 01:41:17,766
using a style,
some would call it human-like,

1236
01:41:17,871 --> 01:41:20,465
that bot fighting has rarely seen.

1237
01:41:20,574 --> 01:41:22,769
Atom and his pint-size trainer
step into the ring

1238
01:41:22,876 --> 01:41:25,743
and the look on
Farra Lemkova's face says it all.

1239
01:41:25,846 --> 01:41:28,007
Welcome to the bigs, junior!

1240
01:41:28,115 --> 01:41:30,948
I'm giving one-to-five odds that Atom
don't make it out the first round.

1241
01:41:31,051 --> 01:41:32,541
Who wants some?

1242
01:41:33,186 --> 01:41:34,881
I'll take some of that action.

1243
01:41:34,988 --> 01:41:38,151
Hey, there!
I'll take some of that action.

1244
01:41:39,493 --> 01:41:42,553
How's it going... partner?

1245
01:41:42,662 --> 01:41:44,027
Partner?

1246
01:41:44,598 --> 01:41:47,761
That's great. How about a hundred K?
Is that funny?

1247
01:41:47,868 --> 01:41:50,530
Hundred K says Atom
doesn't see round two.

1248
01:41:50,637 --> 01:41:52,468
You carrying around
that kind of scratch?

1249
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:55,970
- Yeah.
- Hundred K?

1250
01:41:56,676 --> 01:42:00,908
Tell you what.
Remember section 101, row C,

1251
01:42:01,014 --> 01:42:03,710
and you can bring me
my money right to my seat.

1252
01:42:03,817 --> 01:42:07,184
101, row C? Hundred K?

1253
01:42:07,954 --> 01:42:09,216
You heard me, homey.

1254
01:42:09,523 --> 01:42:11,184
- Homey?
- Right?

1255
01:42:11,491 --> 01:42:12,651
Homeboy!

1256
01:42:13,827 --> 01:42:16,159
All right. Peace out, posse.

1257
01:42:16,463 --> 01:42:17,760
Come on, sugar. Let's go.

1258
01:42:41,555 --> 01:42:44,183
- Never beaten.
- It's showtime!

1259
01:42:44,491 --> 01:42:46,584
Never threatened.

1260
01:42:46,693 --> 01:42:49,856
The king of the ring,

1261
01:42:49,963 --> 01:42:52,090
the ruler of robots!

1262
01:42:53,266 --> 01:42:58,602
Bow down to the mighty Zeus!

1263
01:43:24,231 --> 01:43:25,255
Oh, shit!

1264
01:43:31,838 --> 01:43:33,135
That was awesome.

1265
01:43:39,813 --> 01:43:40,973
Come on, let's go.

1266
01:43:47,754 --> 01:43:50,314
Ladies and gentlemen,

1267
01:43:50,624 --> 01:43:53,149
in a bout scheduled for five rounds

1268
01:43:53,260 --> 01:43:56,696
for the World Robot
Boxing Championship,

1269
01:43:56,796 --> 01:44:01,324
in the corner to my right,
the challenger, Atom!

1270
01:44:01,568 --> 01:44:02,694
Showboat!

1271
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:09,040
And in the corner to my left,

1272
01:44:09,142 --> 01:44:12,168
the undeniable champion
of this universe

1273
01:44:12,279 --> 01:44:15,874
and any other universe known
or unknown,

1274
01:44:15,982 --> 01:44:20,214
the mighty Zeus!

1275
01:44:24,791 --> 01:44:28,989
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready

1276
01:44:29,095 --> 01:44:34,089
for Real Steel!

1277
01:44:37,037 --> 01:44:38,197
This is what it's all about!

1278
01:44:38,305 --> 01:44:42,298
There's the starting bell
and we are underway.

1279
01:44:42,609 --> 01:44:44,338
The bots emerge from their corners.

1280
01:44:45,245 --> 01:44:48,305
Zeus decks Atom, and he is already down.

1281
01:44:48,615 --> 01:44:49,741
On your feet!

1282
01:44:49,849 --> 01:44:52,317
Looks like we are in
for another Zeus clinic.

1283
01:44:54,788 --> 01:44:57,188
Referee Matt Geiger
coming in the ring to start the count.

1284
01:44:58,258 --> 01:44:59,316
Get up!

1285
01:45:00,994 --> 01:45:03,155
Push up! Stand up!

1286
01:45:04,197 --> 01:45:06,791
But look at this.
The little bot's back on his feet

1287
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:09,368
to get a second blistering attack
from Zeus!

1288
01:45:09,669 --> 01:45:12,661
Atom is down for the second time
in less than ten seconds.

1289
01:45:12,772 --> 01:45:16,731
- He's too strong!
- That's my boy right there!

1290
01:45:18,745 --> 01:45:20,269
Get up and get in the game!

1291
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:23,406
Come on! No, please Atom, get up!
Please!

1292
01:45:23,717 --> 01:45:26,242
Get up! Get up! Get up!

1293
01:45:27,887 --> 01:45:31,288
Once again,
the challenger finds his feet!

1294
01:45:31,891 --> 01:45:32,915
Lean back!

1295
01:45:33,026 --> 01:45:35,324
Atom's getting pummeled into the corner!

1296
01:45:35,428 --> 01:45:37,794
- Get out of there!
- Move!

1297
01:45:40,066 --> 01:45:42,125
A demolishing inside shot.

1298
01:45:42,235 --> 01:45:43,361
Get your hands up!

1299
01:45:45,372 --> 01:45:46,930
Hands up!

1300
01:45:47,874 --> 01:45:49,307
Crush that little can!

1301
01:45:49,409 --> 01:45:50,899
Get out of the corner!

1302
01:45:51,011 --> 01:45:54,310
Kenton desperately trying to command
his robot out of that suicide corner.

1303
01:45:59,252 --> 01:46:00,310
Get your feet under you!

1304
01:46:01,988 --> 01:46:04,047
Good night, sparring bot!

1305
01:46:04,157 --> 01:46:06,887
It might have taken Zeus a bit longer,
but he's done it again!

1306
01:46:06,993 --> 01:46:10,326
Atom is down for the third
and possibly final time tonight.

1307
01:46:10,430 --> 01:46:12,796
- Stand up!
- Two!

1308
01:46:12,899 --> 01:46:14,298
Three!

1309
01:46:14,401 --> 01:46:15,766
Atom, get up!

1310
01:46:15,869 --> 01:46:17,928
- Get up, Atom.
- Get up, Atom.

1311
01:46:18,438 --> 01:46:21,305
- Six! Seven!
- Get up!

1312
01:46:21,408 --> 01:46:23,308
Eight! Nine!

1313
01:46:24,344 --> 01:46:28,872
I don't believe this! Against all odds,
this little bot is on his feet again.

1314
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:31,142
Come on, Atom!

1315
01:46:34,287 --> 01:46:35,447
He can't survive this!

1316
01:46:39,259 --> 01:46:41,454
- Come on, Charlie!
- Right uppercut!

1317
01:46:42,896 --> 01:46:45,490
Atom has landed a punch!

1318
01:46:45,799 --> 01:46:50,827
Zeus is stunned as he reels back from
an uppercut that he never saw coming!

1319
01:46:50,937 --> 01:46:52,370
Advance!

1320
01:46:52,472 --> 01:46:53,962
Fade back, counter right!

1321
01:46:54,774 --> 01:46:55,934
Fade back, counter right!

1322
01:46:56,776 --> 01:47:01,213
Right cross! Right cross!
Right cross! Left hook!

1323
01:47:01,314 --> 01:47:04,181
- Let's go! Come on!
- Take him down!

1324
01:47:04,851 --> 01:47:06,910
For the first time in his dominant run,

1325
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:10,888
Zeus has met a bot
who simply won't back down!

1326
01:47:12,525 --> 01:47:15,358
The crowd is going nuts!
Zeus gives it everything he's got

1327
01:47:15,462 --> 01:47:18,431
as we reach the last 15 seconds
of round one!

1328
01:47:18,531 --> 01:47:22,490
Zeus corners Atom,
going double duty with both fists!

1329
01:47:22,802 --> 01:47:25,794
Downtown, uptown,
as the clock winds down!

1330
01:47:25,905 --> 01:47:28,965
- Hands up, chin down.
- Stay low, stay low!

1331
01:47:32,479 --> 01:47:37,542
Only five seconds left, as here comes
that piston-packed right of the champ!

1332
01:47:39,085 --> 01:47:43,249
There's the bell! I don't believe it.
Somehow Atom has survived.

1333
01:47:43,356 --> 01:47:48,419
We will have a second round.
And the crowd here is thrilled!

1334
01:47:51,531 --> 01:47:54,864
He made it! Yeah! Corner!

1335
01:47:56,336 --> 01:48:00,170
We got to get out of here.
We got to get out of here now!

1336
01:48:02,976 --> 01:48:05,274
We got to go this way. Come on!

1337
01:48:10,850 --> 01:48:12,147
OK, you sit down.

1338
01:48:15,321 --> 01:48:18,017
- Let's go, homey.
- All right.

1339
01:48:18,124 --> 01:48:19,557
I'll be back for you, baby.

1340
01:48:20,527 --> 01:48:22,859
Get your hands off me!

1341
01:48:25,265 --> 01:48:28,200
Both corners furiously working
on their bots.

1342
01:48:28,301 --> 01:48:31,634
This crowd came here tonight
expecting a massacre,

1343
01:48:31,938 --> 01:48:33,929
but instead they're getting a war!

1344
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:35,371
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1345
01:48:35,475 --> 01:48:36,499
All right. Here we go.

1346
01:48:36,609 --> 01:48:38,907
What is happening?

1347
01:48:39,012 --> 01:48:44,006
He is fully prepared for all possible
contingencies. He will be fine.

1348
01:48:44,117 --> 01:48:45,414
What next?

1349
01:48:46,286 --> 01:48:47,583
Round two.

1350
01:48:55,895 --> 01:48:59,194
Round two kicks off,
and incredibly the challenger, Atom,

1351
01:48:59,299 --> 01:49:01,324
is giving the champ a run for his money.

1352
01:49:03,069 --> 01:49:06,664
Zeus tosses the smaller bot
across the ring like a tin can!

1353
01:49:10,443 --> 01:49:15,437
Kenton working his bot with a trifecta
of straight rights to the champ's dome!

1354
01:49:20,486 --> 01:49:24,479
Toe-to-toe they stand,
trading deafening blows!

1355
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:31,326
Whatever strategy either corner
had cooked up has been destroyed!

1356
01:49:34,167 --> 01:49:37,500
Metal bashing metal.
Steel smashing steel.

1357
01:49:37,604 --> 01:49:40,004
This is a brawl!

1358
01:49:42,609 --> 01:49:47,512
The crowd is on their feet, watching two
machines driven to kill each other!

1359
01:49:47,614 --> 01:49:50,310
Something has to give, and it does!

1360
01:49:50,416 --> 01:49:52,247
Atom goes down again!

1361
01:49:52,352 --> 01:49:56,482
Lights out for the junkyard dog who put
on a heck of a show here tonight!

1362
01:49:58,591 --> 01:50:01,253
And yet again, Atom rises up.

1363
01:50:01,361 --> 01:50:05,957
Kenton must have hardwired
this bot with the will to go on!

1364
01:50:12,272 --> 01:50:17,300
Midway through round four, and Zeus
is looking to end this thing right now.

1365
01:50:17,410 --> 01:50:21,744
The champ is holding nothing back
as he cracks open the hurt locker!

1366
01:50:32,025 --> 01:50:35,722
Atom is stumbling around the ring,
apparently disoriented and dazed!

1367
01:50:36,029 --> 01:50:37,428
- Hands up!
- What's going on?

1368
01:50:37,530 --> 01:50:40,465
I think the voice recog is shot!
He's not responding!

1369
01:50:43,703 --> 01:50:48,470
Zeus has found yet another gear of
violence, drilling Atom's midsection.

1370
01:50:48,574 --> 01:50:51,771
No! Stop! Do something!

1371
01:50:52,078 --> 01:50:53,102
He can't hear me!

1372
01:50:54,447 --> 01:51:00,079
But the bell sounds, and once again
this little robot has stunned the world!

1373
01:51:02,188 --> 01:51:06,591
We're done, Max! He can't hear me.
This is murder. We've had enough.

1374
01:51:06,693 --> 01:51:09,253
- I'm disabling the voice recognition.
- He can't hear me!

1375
01:51:09,362 --> 01:51:11,694
- Yes, but he can see you!
- What?

1376
01:51:13,166 --> 01:51:16,067
I'm putting him in shadow mode.
Show him what to do.

1377
01:51:16,169 --> 01:51:18,535
Without the voice recognition,
he'll move even faster!

1378
01:51:18,638 --> 01:51:19,798
No way. No way!

1379
01:51:20,106 --> 01:51:22,074
Look at them. They are freaking out!

1380
01:51:22,575 --> 01:51:24,634
Rich girl is ripping him
a new one over there!

1381
01:51:24,744 --> 01:51:26,769
Do you know why?
Because they're scared.

1382
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:29,241
Because Atom can do things
no other bot has ever done.

1383
01:51:29,349 --> 01:51:31,214
- But I can't do it!
- Yes, you can.

1384
01:51:31,317 --> 01:51:34,115
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1385
01:51:35,254 --> 01:51:38,712
Show him what to do.
You have to fight the last round.

1386
01:51:39,025 --> 01:51:40,390
Don't ask me. Don't.

1387
01:51:40,493 --> 01:51:45,089
Charlie... please. I beg you.

1388
01:51:53,740 --> 01:51:55,230
Are you kidding me with those eyes?

1389
01:51:57,110 --> 01:51:58,577
Damn it!

1390
01:51:58,678 --> 01:51:59,736
Yes!

1391
01:52:00,546 --> 01:52:02,138
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1392
01:52:03,216 --> 01:52:05,582
I know you're in there! I'm not sure
if you're getting this or what,

1393
01:52:05,685 --> 01:52:07,118
but I know you're in there!

1394
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:09,484
- Kenton. In or out?
- In. Give me a minute.

1395
01:52:13,092 --> 01:52:17,654
I know you can't hear me,
but you can see me, so watch me!

1396
01:52:17,764 --> 01:52:20,426
Watch... me.

1397
01:52:20,533 --> 01:52:24,196
- You know you're talking to a robot.
- I know. Shut up.

1398
01:52:25,304 --> 01:52:26,862
Watch me.

1399
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:29,331
An epic battle being waged here tonight,

1400
01:52:29,442 --> 01:52:31,535
as the fifth and final round
gets underway.

1401
01:52:31,644 --> 01:52:33,271
Come on, Atom!

1402
01:52:42,789 --> 01:52:45,189
Wait a second. Are you seeing this?

1403
01:52:45,291 --> 01:52:48,419
Charlie Kenton is shadowboxing
just outside the ring!

1404
01:52:48,528 --> 01:52:50,723
It looks like Atom
has a shadow function.

1405
01:52:50,830 --> 01:52:53,697
So, basically,
that means Charlie Kenton

1406
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:56,667
is fighting the last round
of this fight against Zeus.

1407
01:52:56,769 --> 01:53:01,365
It doesn't seem to help, because Atom
is backed up against the ropes again.

1408
01:53:03,409 --> 01:53:05,309
Help him! Fight back!

1409
01:53:05,411 --> 01:53:06,503
Not yet.

1410
01:53:10,116 --> 01:53:13,847
Tak Mashido supervising personally
as Zeus hammers down,

1411
01:53:14,153 --> 01:53:16,883
furiously trying to end this thing
once and for all.

1412
01:53:17,890 --> 01:53:20,916
I got to tell you, folks,
the champ looks tired.

1413
01:53:21,227 --> 01:53:23,457
This robot seems to be running on empty.

1414
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:29,632
I don't believe it.
Atom is taunting Zeus.

1415
01:53:29,735 --> 01:53:33,364
- Switch to turbo!
- He's actually asking for more.

1416
01:53:35,341 --> 01:53:36,865
Please do something!

1417
01:53:37,176 --> 01:53:39,406
- Not yet.
- That's right, Charlie. Not yet.

1418
01:53:42,181 --> 01:53:43,546
Nitrous pistons, now!

1419
01:53:46,686 --> 01:53:48,654
He's not going to last much longer!

1420
01:53:48,754 --> 01:53:50,688
- Fight back!
- Not yet.

1421
01:53:51,457 --> 01:53:52,719
Hang in there!

1422
01:53:52,825 --> 01:53:58,286
Atom is riddled with the nitrous-fueled
Gatling guns of Zeus's blows!

1423
01:53:59,465 --> 01:54:03,299
Atom! Atom! Atom! Atom!

1424
01:54:06,606 --> 01:54:08,733
Wait him out, wait him out! Not yet!

1425
01:54:11,344 --> 01:54:13,437
Zeus is slowing down!

1426
01:54:13,546 --> 01:54:16,413
The champ's power core
is clearly depleted.

1427
01:54:16,516 --> 01:54:17,574
Charlie, please!

1428
01:54:19,819 --> 01:54:20,911
Hey, kid.

1429
01:54:21,787 --> 01:54:23,379
- Now.
- Now!

1430
01:54:28,661 --> 01:54:29,719
Get in there!

1431
01:54:32,298 --> 01:54:34,562
Knock that little bitch! Bust him open!

1432
01:54:43,509 --> 01:54:44,874
Yeah! That's right!

1433
01:54:46,445 --> 01:54:47,673
Do something!

1434
01:54:48,548 --> 01:54:49,606
Move!

1435
01:54:50,983 --> 01:54:53,474
Override. Switching to manual.

1436
01:54:55,521 --> 01:55:00,356
In a shocking move, Tak Mashido is
manually operating his robot personally!

1437
01:55:10,803 --> 01:55:13,499
- Work the body! Get inside him!
- Get him, Atom!

1438
01:55:15,274 --> 01:55:19,768
Look at this! The champ is trying
desperately to stay on his feet,

1439
01:55:19,879 --> 01:55:25,044
but Kenton is relentless, landing
blow after blow after blow to the body!

1440
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:09,621
Left! Right! Left! Right!

1441
01:56:09,729 --> 01:56:14,894
A huge uppercut by Atom! Zeus is down!

1442
01:56:19,605 --> 01:56:22,768
This little bot has
dug deep here tonight

1443
01:56:22,875 --> 01:56:25,605
and shown something damn near heart!

1444
01:56:25,711 --> 01:56:29,909
One, two, three,

1445
01:56:30,016 --> 01:56:34,953
four, five, six, seven...

1446
01:56:35,054 --> 01:56:36,078
He's good!

1447
01:56:36,389 --> 01:56:39,722
Zeus gets to his feet,
but Kenton has Atom on him again,

1448
01:56:39,825 --> 01:56:41,588
landing punch after punch!

1449
01:56:41,694 --> 01:56:44,060
Tak Mashido and his super bot
have no answer.

1450
01:56:44,363 --> 01:56:47,457
Zeus pins Atom's left arm,
but Kenton is undaunted!

1451
01:56:47,566 --> 01:56:50,535
It all comes down to this, folks!

1452
01:56:50,636 --> 01:56:52,536
Drop him, Charlie! Now!

1453
01:56:52,638 --> 01:56:55,630
- Kenton is about to drop the champ...
- No! There's the bell!

1454
01:56:56,676 --> 01:56:58,871
Zeus is saved by the bell!

1455
01:57:05,785 --> 01:57:08,686
Amazingly, we will go
to the judges' cards!

1456
01:57:22,368 --> 01:57:26,134
Ladies and gentlemen,
after five rounds,

1457
01:57:26,439 --> 01:57:28,999
we go to the judges' scorecards.

1458
01:57:32,945 --> 01:57:37,507
Judge Number One scores the fight 47-48.

1459
01:57:37,616 --> 01:57:42,576
Judge Number Two scores the fight 48-46.

1460
01:57:42,688 --> 01:57:47,421
And Judge Number Three
scores the fight 47-46,

1461
01:57:47,526 --> 01:57:52,725
for the winner
and still World Robot Boxing champion,

1462
01:57:52,832 --> 01:57:55,130
Zeus!

1463
01:58:02,575 --> 01:58:04,736
Farra Lemkova,

1464
01:58:04,844 --> 01:58:07,142
you got way more
than you bargained for tonight.

1465
01:58:07,446 --> 01:58:10,813
Some would say that your bot
won the decision but lost the fight.

1466
01:58:11,584 --> 01:58:12,846
She looks pissed.

1467
01:58:13,552 --> 01:58:15,782
It took a little longer
than we thought,

1468
01:58:15,888 --> 01:58:19,085
but the result is as expected.

1469
01:58:20,526 --> 01:58:24,895
We won. Zeus is still undefeated.

1470
01:58:30,169 --> 01:58:33,502
Any comment on the absolutely
humiliating near loss

1471
01:58:33,606 --> 01:58:34,868
your bot suffered tonight?

1472
01:58:37,877 --> 01:58:40,505
- Nothing.
- No comment.

1473
01:58:40,613 --> 01:58:41,944
Max. Where's Max?

1474
01:58:45,618 --> 01:58:46,778
There he is. Max.

1475
01:58:48,554 --> 01:58:51,955
They're already calling your bot
"the people's champion."

1476
01:58:55,494 --> 01:58:57,257
What do you say to that?

1477
01:58:58,230 --> 01:58:59,720
People's champion?

1478
01:59:02,168 --> 01:59:03,692
Sounds pretty good to me.

1479
01:59:09,608 --> 01:59:11,667
Dad? Dad!

1480
01:59:15,648 --> 01:59:16,808
Dad!

1481
01:59:27,726 --> 01:59:29,250
I really want you to know...

1482
01:59:29,562 --> 01:59:31,621
No, I need you to know.

1483
01:59:33,732 --> 01:59:34,960
Don't worry.

1484
01:59:35,968 --> 01:59:37,731
Your secret's safe with me.

1485
01:59:44,777 --> 01:59:46,540
Wait here. Wait here.

1486
02:00:31,223 --> 02:00:32,918
Yes!
