00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:45,066
So I'm Miss Granada,
director of the Heroics program.

183
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,902
You'll be staying
in our underground stronghold

184
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,112
where children of superheroes
are kept safe

185
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,240
while their parents fight enemy forces.

186
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:55,409
We can't afford to have even one of you
fall into enemy hands.

187
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,494
This way.

188
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,288
Do I really have to go in?

189
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,623
Because I won't fit in.

190
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,583
I just don't belong.

191
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,086
I mean, I'm different from all of them.

192
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,256
Besides, my dad doesn't fight anymore.

193
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,800
And after my mom died, he promised that...

194
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,678
Yes, well, you know what they say
about promises?

195
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,765
You should always keep them
or you're a liar who can never be trusted?

196
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,727
Are you going to be a problem, Missy?

197
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:23,980
Shall we?

198
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:36,783
Everyone…

199
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,411
this is Missy.

200
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,454
She will be joining you today.

201
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:44,125
Missy, I'd appreciate it
if you would take a seat right there

202
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,087
and quietly continue your studies
along with the other children.

203
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,632
Children…

204
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,427
thank you for respecting my rules.

205
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,221
Your parents will be very proud
when I tell them

206
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,848
of your exceptional behavior.

207
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,392
Well done. [chuckles softly]

208
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,874
[whispers] She's gone!

209
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,042
[cheering]

210
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:35,676
[boy] Yeah!

211
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,678
[girl squeals, laughs]

212
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:47,188
- [indistinct chattering]
- [mystical warbling]

213
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,235
[sloshing]

214
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,701
[gasps]

215
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,120
[tires peel out]

216
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:07,791
[tires screech]

217
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,419
Hey, I'm Wheels.

218
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,963
Yes, they call me that
on account of the wheelchair.

219
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:16,050
It's a little on the nose,
but I like it because it's cool.

220
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,094
Okay.

221
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,930
You may think I'm in the chair
'cause my legs are weak,

222
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,431
but it's the opposite.

223
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,351
My muscles are so strong
my bones can't support 'em.

224
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,187
But lucky for me,
my brain's the same way.

225
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:29,730
It's supercharged,

226
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:30,856
so I'm good.

227
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,650
So, Wheels, who's your new friend?

228
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,276
Missy, this is Noodles.

229
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,445
We call him that because, well…

230
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,739
He stretches and twists around
like a noodle?

231
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:39,865
Yeah, basically.

232
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:41,992
And that's Ojo.

233
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,161
Her power is she's a genius drawer.

234
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:47,915
Like Van Gogh mixed with Monet
with just a sprinkle of Salvador Dali.

235
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:48,999
Can I see that?

236
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,130
A kid standing on top of floating chairs?

237
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,677
An exploding exercise ball?

238
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,429
Nothing she draws makes sense.

239
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,430
[Missy] That me?

240
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,685
- Why'd you draw me in front of the class?
- Oh, she won't answer.

241
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,770
She only speaks through her drawings.

242
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:13,941
♪ Don't speak
I know just what you're saying ♪

243
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,110
No, you don't. You have no clue.

244
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,611
And this is A Capella.

245
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,281
- It me.
- That's your superpower? You can sing?

246
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,658
Yep, but I have an unusual range.

247
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,619
I can go low… [sings very low]

248
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:29,457
or I can go high! [sings very high]

249
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,292
I can even go really…

250
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,375
[inaudible]

251
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,211
I don't hear anything.

252
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,088
It's beyond human hearing.

253
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,089
[feedback]

254
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,841
[Granada] Miss A Capella Vox,

255
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,135
please refrain from using your high voice.

256
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:45,181
Every dog in the neighborhood
has surrounded our building.

257
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,849
[laughter]

258
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:50,186
And she can sing so low
that she moves objects.

259
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,229
Show her how you make things float!

260
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,690
[sings very low]

00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,708
[gasps]

262
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,725
All righty, let's see who's left.

263
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,228
That's Blinding Fast's kid, Slo-Mo.

264
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,650
[Wheels] He's actually moving very fast,

265
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,528
but somehow,
his powers have him stuck in a time warp.

266
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,072
[slowly] Hi.

267
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,991
That kid over there…

268
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,786
Two packs of candy for crossing our eyes.

269
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,037
…is Facemaker.

270
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:51,746
Okay.

271
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,668
Beat that.

272
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,003
He makes the craziest faces.

273
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,468
It's impossible!

274
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,096
I can even change my face
to look like you.

275
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,682
[crunching]

276
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,143
He's cheating! I can't compete with that!

277
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,106
Oh, dude!

278
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,483
Rewind, clean up on aisle two.

279
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:23,821
That's Rewind.
He can rewind time but just a few seconds.

00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,789
[Facemaker screams]

282
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,337
They're twins. It's crazy, right?

283
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,965
What twins? What are you talking about?

284
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,634
Fast Forward, are you at it again?

285
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,346
You were taking so long, I skipped you
forward a bit. Sorry, not sorry.

286
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,223
She and Rewind are twins.

287
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,683
Opposite powers.

288
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,769
The only thing they agree on
is they don't like each other.

289
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,229
- At all.
- At all.

290
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,315
They're twins. It's crazy, right?

291
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,943
And then,
there's our fearless leader, Wild Card.

292
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:06,196
There's not a power
in the world he doesn't have.

293
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,656
True.

294
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,992
Sure, he has every power imaginable,

295
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,579
but since he can't focus his energy,
they show up randomly.

296
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,662
Also true…

297
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,624

Guppy.

How are you making that?

303
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,807
My mommy is Lavagirl,
but my daddy is Sharkboy.

304
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,727
So instead of lava, I move water.

Yeah, uh, so with the whole powers thing...

00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,297
Wait a second.

312
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,674
I remember you.

313
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,425
You're Marcus Moreno's kid.

314
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,178
Yeah, my dad hasn't gone
on any missions for a while,

315
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,556
so I've been chilling
with the normal kids.

316
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,227
Why would they put a kid with superpowers
in with normal kids?

317
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,270
Oh, I get it.

318
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:23,065
You don't have any powers.

319
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:24,984
You're powerless?

320
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,695
Whatever. Can we put on the TV?

You know this is
an epic Heroic smackdown event

324
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,915
when they've called in Sharkboy!

325

- [cheering]
- Yeah!

326
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:45,796
[male anchor] Earlier today,
Sharkboy appeared from the ocean depths,

327
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,924
landing on the beach
of South Padre Island.

328
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,260
And moments later, Lavagirl

329
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,555
blasted up from inside an active volcano.

330
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,099
Go Sharkboy and Lavagirl!

331
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,268

She's from the Earth's core.

And here's Mayor Doolittle

00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,356
at today's ribbon cutting
for his new city hall,

334

Did you see that?

337
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,449
Of course you didn't.

338
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,326
That means
it's none other than Blinding Fast,

339
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,829
the fastest Heroic on the planet.

340
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:22,416
[slowly] Go, Dad!

341
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,626

And there goes the mayor's new building
in record time.

344
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:34,386
These battles are insanely expensive
for taxpayers,

345
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,597
but so entertaining.

346
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,099
Pass the popcorn.
This battle's gonna be epic!

347
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,686
[female anchor] This is unprecedented.

348
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:47,316
All of the Heroics have been called
into action against the alien threat.

349
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,488
We're getting some live footage now.

350
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,573
And look who's back in action.

351
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,949
It's Miracle Guy.

352
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,203
You didn't expect him
to actually lose, did you?

353

No way!

Oh no.
I'm just getting some terrible news.

It's almost unimaginable,
but two of our heroes

369

have been captured by the intruders.

370

I thought the Heroics were unbeatable.

They are unbeatable.

And here comes Mrs. Vox to the rescue.

I promised I wouldn't be a hero anymore.

We're getting word that the president
would like to address the nation.

it's bad, it...

It's hopelessly bad.

How did this guy get to be president?

433
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:40,359
He can't even put two sentences together.

434
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,362
We have just received a message

from the supreme commander of the aliens

436
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,991

It reads, "We are from the planet Ogima.

As long as you stay where you are,
you are all safe.

451
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,371
Yeah, right. They can't protect us
from that. We just saw it.

452
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:35,664
You got a better idea?

453
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,875
We should probably do
what Miss Granada says.

Uh, pardon me, but...

Why?

460
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:58,770
Because the aliens know where we are,
and they're coming for us next.

She drew these things five minutes
before they happened.

00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,380
Ojo's superpower isn't that she can draw,

469

suddenly make perfect sense.

that we weren't safe here.

00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,262
[Missy] Look, there's the supply ship.

900
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,680
Just like Ojo's drawing!

901
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,433
[kids] Ew. Gross!

902
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:52,935
Shh. Keep it down!

903
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:54,685
Wait.

904
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:56,313
Wait a second.

905
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:57,439
Let's go.

906
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,951
Shut the door and let's get out of here.

907
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:12,120
- Wheels, can you...
- No! We're not all here!

908
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,622
What? Who's missing?

909
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,624
Oh… [sighs]

910
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,591
Slo-Mo! Cut it out! Run!

911
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,260
[snarling]

912
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,470
Hurry! They're coming back!

913
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:31,640
- Ten to one says he's tentacled.
- Dude!

914
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:35,185
- [Rewind] Come on, Slo-Mo!
- [kids shout encouragement]

915
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,938
[vocalizes "Chariots of Fire"]

916
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,613
[growling, snarling]

917
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,075
All right, hold me down!

918
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,210
Slo-Mo!

919
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,128
Yes!

920
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,174
[screaming]

921
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,302
Wheels, tell me you figured this out!

922
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,053
It's incredibly intuitive.

923
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:11,889
Whoa!

924
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:14,975
[screaming]

925
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:19,021
- Please just choose any button!
- It might be one of these.

926
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:24,401
[screaming]

927
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,195
[engine starts]

928
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,255
But now what?

929
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:47,799
Don't worry.

930
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:52,137
Any minute now, Ojo's gonna draw
a picture of all of us smiling

931
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,722
and hugging our parents.

932
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,724
Isn't that right, Ojo?

933
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:59,019
Oh, that's just great.

934
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,147
Hey…

935
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:07,194
why did you choose me to share
the idea of looking at Ojo's iPad?

936
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:08,779
I don't know.

937
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:12,574
I guess I know how hard it feels
when everyone expects so much from you,

938
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,743
and you feel like you can't deliver.

939
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,454
Do you believe I can?

940
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,122
We all believe you can.

941
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,541
Tell that to my parents.

942
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:23,668
I will,

943
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,129
right after we rescue them.

944
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,059
I'm gonna go check it out.

945
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,318
We're all good.

946
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:53,198
Am I just really small,
or is this ship really big?

947
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:56,910
- It's enormous.
- Yeah. How are we gonna find our parents?

948
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,412
I was thinking about that.

949
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:02,332
Mrs. Granada found us really easily
back at Grandma's house,

950
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,084
and I think I know how,

951
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,377
your bracelet.

952
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:08,338
I haven't been able to contact my dad.

953
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:11,633
But maybe the transmitter in here
that connects the two bracelets

954
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,343
works like a tracking device.

955
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,346
But I need a pair of pliers
and a heat source.

956
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,932
My teeth are strong
because my dad's a shark.

957
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:21,351
- Perfect.
- And I've got a heat source.

958
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,020
Heat vision!

959
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,772
Now he's a toaster.

960
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,401
Close enough.

961
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,423
[bracelet beeping]

962
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:12,444
Is it working?

963
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,988
Well, it's leading us somewhere.

964
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,909
[bracelet continues beeping]

965
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:22,621
Hey! That was really good back there.

966
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:25,415
Turning into a toaster
instead of making heat vision?

967
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,085
It was heat-related. That's real progress.

968
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,295
I guess it's progress.

969
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:31,379
You just watch.

970
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:34,591
Pretty soon, you'll be teleporting
like it's nobody's business.

971
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:35,675
It's about belief.

972
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,302
Um, guys…

973
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:38,887
[rumbling]

974
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,223
Does anybody else hear that?

975
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,309
What is that?

976
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,353
It's below us.

977
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:52,901
I can feel it.

978
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:55,403
[rattling]

979
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,739
[revving]

980
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,368
[Wild Card] Uh!

981
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,250
[screaming]

982
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:11,377
[screaming]

983
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:19,803
[chittering]

984
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,348
[Facemaker] Which way?

985
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:26,226
That way!

986
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:33,066
- [snarling]
- [screaming]

987
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,777
[vocalizes]

988
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:48,206
Look at that thing.

989
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:52,961
[door opening]

990
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,760
What the heck
is the president doing here?

991
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,640
So they're inside this thing?
All of them?

992
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:09,603
- [man] That's correct.
- How long before the takeover begins?

993
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:13,273
According to the supreme commander,
less than an hour.

994
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,399
[president] So soon?

995
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:16,985
[man] That's what she says,
and she's never wrong.

996
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,612
You don't have to remind me.

997
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,239
Ever wonder why we bother with all this

998
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:23,825
when she already knows
how it's gonna turn out?

999
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:26,119
All part of the process, I suppose.

1000
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,040
What is that thing?

1001
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:34,961
You heard him. It's a rocket
stuffed to the gills with aliens.

1002
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:38,798
In less than an hour, they'll send it
down to Earth and start the takeover.

1003
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:42,344
Well, then we have to stop them. Let's go.

1004
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:48,225
Do you children have any idea
what you've done?

1005
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:50,352
Stealing one of our trains?

1006
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:52,312
Turning headquarters upside down?

1007
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:55,857
Flying an alien shuttle
into outer space. Hmm?

1008
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,195
[squeals] Well done!

1009
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:04,741
Looks like
we underestimated your abilities

1010
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:06,493
and your leadership qualities.

1011
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:09,537
You took a huge risk,
but it was the right risk.

1012
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:12,540
Headquarters was attacked
just minutes after you escaped.

1013
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:15,919
If you hadn't broken out,
you would have all been captured.

1014
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:19,673
And now you've managed to lead us
into the heart of this alien mother ship?

1015
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,383
[gasps] Mm.

1016
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:23,551
So proud!

1017
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:26,388
Wait, so we're not in trouble?

1018
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:28,014
Of course not.

1019
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,808
You are heroes.

1020
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,768
- Yeah!
- [cheering]

1021
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,770
Yes! [chuckles]

1022
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:34,980
[Wheels] Missy!

1023
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,774
Her vital signs are all over the place.

1024
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,323
Save your breath, Granada.

1025
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:47,284
They know.

1026
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,329
Uh-oh!

1027
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:52,914
[slithering sound]

1028
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:56,710
Hmm…

1029
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,628
Well, then… round them up!

1030
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,214
[kids grunt]

1031
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:09,973
[chittering]

1032
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:12,434
[Facemaker] Watch it!

1033
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:24,321
[grunts]

1034
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:28,366
Quit the pantomime, Slo-Mo.

1035
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,493
- You didn't even scrape a knee.
- Mm-hmm.

1036
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:31,870
[Granada] Oh, good.

1037
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:35,707
Just the kind of divisive attitude
I've been counting on.

1038
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,544
You kids are just like your parents.

1039
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:40,670
The same in-fighting.

1040
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:42,964
The same bickering.

1041
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:46,843
Putting your own egos ahead of your team.

1042
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,429
- Take away her water.
- [gasps]

1043
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,389
[gasps]

1044
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,602
They're too powerful together.

1045
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,942
Oh, don't worry.

1046
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,487
I won't take away your little toy.

1047
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:08,114
I already know what your future is.

1048
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:11,284
Imprisonment.

1049
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,828
Life long.

1050
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:17,164
Hmm.

1051
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:19,876
[chuckles]

1052
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,214
[beeping]

1053
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:28,510
[clunking]

1054
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:32,180
How are we getting out of here?

1055
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,603
I…

1056
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,272
Don't know.

1057
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,150
[sighs]

1058
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,070
What do you mean you don't know?

1059
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:48,863
I mean…

1060
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:50,824
[sighs] I don't know.

1061
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,618
I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

1062
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:54,786
Enough thinking.

1063
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,372
I'm gonna punch my way out of here.

1064
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:01,334
I have to save my son.

1065
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,503
[grunting]

1066
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:05,713
That's not gonna work.

1067
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:08,133
How do you know?

1068
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:11,886
While you were blinking your eyes,
I went around and tried everything.

1069
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,012
[mocks]

1070
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:18,601
Uh, you were saying?

1071
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:23,731
[snarling]

1072
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,486
What are you? An alien spy?

1073
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,197
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1074
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,991
I just want to see what it is.

1075
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:35,285
Don't worry.
It won't even know I touched it.

1076
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,414
[snarls]

1077
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:41,249
[snarls]

A-ha!

1083
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:54,554
Anita Moreno?

1084
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:55,637
Hmm!

1085
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:57,390
Hi, Mom.

1086
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,809
No, no, no, don't "Hi, Mom" me.

1087
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:02,187
- [exhales sharply]
- That was pathetic.

1088
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:06,983
You stop training for a year
and look what happens. Eh?

1089
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:08,902
You… dropped your guard.

1090
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:12,155
And you…
attacked when you should have blocked.

1091
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:17,327
And you rushed
when you should've calculated. Eh?

1092
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:21,789
I hope your kids
paid more attention to me than you did.

1093
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:23,666
Thanks, Mom.

1094
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:30,798
I bet Miss Granada's
been working there for years.

1095
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:35,220
They must have hacked the elections
and put their own alien in as president

1096
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:37,514
so they could set a trap for the Heroics.

1097
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,807
I'm such an idiot.

1098
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,228
President Neil Anami.

1099
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,939
Spell Neil Anami backwards and you have…

1100
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:49,067
"I'm an alien."

1101
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:53,154
Everyone thinks that the aliens
only invaded this morning,

1102
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:55,823
but they've been here for years,

1103
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:58,117
planning this takeover the whole time.

1104
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,537
And now we're locked in this stupid cell

1105
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,955
with no way out.

1106
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:03,706
You're welcome.

1107
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,083

1110
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:12,924
I need water.
Without water, I can't use my powers.

1111
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:16,594
I need food. My stomach hurts.

1112
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:19,764
- My arm hurts.
- My ears hurt!

1113
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,850
We never should have come.
You led us here.

1114
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:25,562
You think I wanted to get locked up
in an alien ship?

1115
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:26,896
It was all of us.

1116
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:29,816
We did it together.

1117
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:31,192
I wanna go home.

1118
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:33,069
[Twins in unison] Me too!

1119
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:34,445
We all want to go home.

1120
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:37,031
The key is figuring out
how to get out of this room

1121
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:39,534
so we can make sure
there's a home to go back to.

1122
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:40,618
Wait a second.

1123
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,162
What did you just say?

1124
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:46,416
- He said we all want to go home.
- Not that, the second part.

1125
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:48,251
"Figure out how to get out of this room

1126
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:50,378

1127
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:52,088
Stop saying that.

1128
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,548
Keep it together.

1129
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:55,717
Guys…

1130
00:59:56,968 --> 01:00:00,054
maybe it's time to admit
we're never getting out of here.

1131
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:02,932
- What?
- I mean, let's get real.

1132
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:06,352
These walls and this door
must be, like, two-feet thick.

1133
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,187
It's totally impossible.

1134
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,982
- Wow, great attitude.
- [Missy] Yep.

1135
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,568
We're never getting out of here,

1136
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:17,030
and we're certainly never seeing
our parents again, that's for sure.

1137
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:23,578
She's right. Pretty soon
we'll forget what they even look like.

1138
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:25,288
The way they smelled…

1139
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:27,624
It'll all just be…

1140
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:29,000
gone.

1141
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:32,253
Jeez, you guys are really bumming me out.

1142
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,298
But I guess…

1143
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:38,926
this really is the end.

1144
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:42,221
- But I'm not ready for the end.
- [sniffles]

1145
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:44,015
I was just starting to think…

1146
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,351
maybe my sister didn't hate me.

1147
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,144
I don't hate you.

1148
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:50,063
[both] I love you.

1149
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:51,981
That love we feel…

1150
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:53,232
is real.

1151
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:55,525
And…

1152
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,153
it's that love…

1153
01:00:58,363 --> 01:00:59,697
that'll get us out of here.

1154
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:03,785
Why are guys saying all this stuff?
It's almost like you want everyone to cry…

1155
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,245
Oh!

1156
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,373
Guppy, quick, gather all the tears.

1157
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,601
What are you making?

1158
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,103
I'm making a key.

1159
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:36,150
Little Miss Guppy,

1160
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:38,236
you just saved us.

1161

01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:55,670
How long has it been this bad?

1166
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:57,964
- You should've come to me.
- You?

1167
01:01:58,047 --> 01:01:59,215
- Yup.
- Hmm!

1168
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:03,720
Don't you remember what your generation
was like when we took over?

1169
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:04,887
- Good point.
- Mm-hmm.

1170
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:08,182
Well, I guess it's up to the kids.

1171
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,977
The next generation is always more…

1172
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:12,895
powerful, more…

1173
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:14,604
Evolved?

1174
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:17,442
I got it!

1175
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,903
What? You figure a way out of here?

1176
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:25,074
Oh… no. I figured out how to switch on
these security monitors.

1177
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:28,286
Surprisingly intuitive.

1178
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:29,579
What?

1179
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:31,414
At least now we can watch something

1180
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:33,875
instead of sitting around
yelling at each other.

1181
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:37,795
Wait, what's this?

1182
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:39,922
A Capella?

1183
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:41,340
- Rewind?
- Fast Forward?

1184
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:44,302
Are those our children?

1185
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:47,096
Wheels, how much time do we have?

1186
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,264
Eighteen minutes.

1187
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:50,850
Then we need to hurry
if we want to stop the takeover.

1188
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:52,852
Us? Are you nuts?

1189
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:56,022
We have to go free our parents
and let them handle it.

1190
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:59,192
No! There's no time for that!
By the time we get there, they...

1191
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:01,486
No! I'm through listening to you.

1192
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:03,529
When I woke up,
everything was perfect,

1193
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,656
then you come along
and everything's a mess.

1194
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:08,326
If Little Miss No-Powers
is who you want as a leader,

1195
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:10,995
fine, follow her straight into Alienville.

1196
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:13,915
But Facemaker and I
are gonna go get our parents.

1197
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:16,501
- We are?
- Yes. Right now.

1198
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:19,086
Guys, we have to stick together.

1199
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:22,298
Guys!

1200
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:26,135
What can you do?

1201
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:29,013
- Some people are just...
- [Wheels] Forget him.

1202
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:32,475
We need to get to the rocket
so I can stop it before it launches.

1203
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:34,727
How are you so sure you can do that?

1204
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,772
Because everything the aliens build
is super intuitive to use,

1205
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:40,525
almost like it was designed
for children to operate.

1206
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:45,238
Get me close. I'll turn it off.

1207
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:49,575
I don't understand. Why did we split up?

1208
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:51,702
Where are we going?

1209
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:56,707
- How do you know our parents are this way?
- Okay, this is good.

1210
01:03:57,416 --> 01:04:01,003
- What do you mean, "This is good"?
- Are you questioning my authority?

Uh… I don't even know
what we're talking about.

That's what you're going with?

Everyone stand back!

[Guppy growls]

1254
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:22,436
[Rewind] Whoa!

[gasps]

1261
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:13,945
Go.

[tires screech]

1263
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:25,666
He's a miracle.

1264
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:27,585
[Missy] Great job, Wheels!

Ew!

1270
01:07:45,102 --> 01:07:46,312
Ew!

- [chains rattle]

1273
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:25,476
Focus on super strength!

1274
01:08:26,143 --> 01:08:27,561
Ugh… [sighs]

1275
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:29,187
[groans]

1276
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:32,983
Focus on teleportation.

[grunts, groans]

1278
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:45,329
Hmm… Nice try, kid.

1279
01:08:45,412 --> 01:08:47,623
- Take him to interrogation.

Rewind!

1282
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:55,714
I can't.

1283
01:08:56,674 --> 01:08:58,717
- We can do this.
- How?

1284
01:08:58,801 --> 01:08:59,802
We work together.

1285
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:01,679
I'll help you.

out of the ceiling!

[shackles clink]

1290
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:14,984

Again!

[winding back]

1298
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:44,138
Looking for these?

[chuckles]

1301
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:51,187
Great job, Fast Forward.
Excellent work, Rewind.

1302
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:54,565
- [winding back]
- Excellent work, Rewind.

1303
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:57,026
I just like hearing her say it.

1304
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:58,986
- [winding back]
- Excellent work, Rewind.

1305
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:00,404
Excellent work, Rewind.

1306
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:02,364
Did you see their teamwork?

1307
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:04,074
Just like their parents.

1308
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:06,911
[chuckling]

1309
01:10:10,956 --> 01:10:12,833
Okay, Wild Card, spill it.

1310
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:15,419
What's the big plan, hmm?

1311
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:18,547
Well, the plan was
to get me close enough to you

1312
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:21,967
to turn you into the dumbest alien
that ever existed.

1313
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:26,305
No way! My powers finally worked.

1314
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:29,600
[laughs]

1315
01:10:31,518 --> 01:10:35,064
Keep laughing
and I'll blast you right back to Ogima.

1316
01:10:37,858 --> 01:10:41,111
We have ways of getting
the truth out of you, you know.

1317
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,529
That'd be a first.

1318
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,741
- Ha!
- [snickering]

1319
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:54,500
We only have six minutes left!

1320
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:58,754
Not a problem. Not a problem.

1321
01:10:58,837 --> 01:11:01,799
All I have to do is
reprogram the rocket's main contr...

1322
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:09,056
What is that?

1323
01:11:11,183 --> 01:11:12,309
Maybe it's a…

1324
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:17,815
A force field?

1325
01:11:17,898 --> 01:11:20,359
No, no, no, we were so close!

1326
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:23,195
But there's no one here but us.

1327
01:11:24,029 --> 01:11:25,447
Who did this?

1328
01:11:26,323 --> 01:11:27,366
[Ojo] I did.

1329
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:35,958
Ojo, did you just talk?

1330
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:37,960
I could always talk.

1331
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:41,964
I simply chose to observe
and listen instead.

1332
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:44,967
And what I heard was chaos,

1333
01:11:46,176 --> 01:11:47,176
dysfunction,

1334
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:48,929
disharmony…

1335
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:51,765
just like your parents.

1336
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:53,851
But that's not true.

1337
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:57,271
We were working together.

1338
01:11:57,855 --> 01:11:58,856
Were you?

1339
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:00,941
Then where's Wild Card?

1340
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,319
That's a good question.

1341
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:04,903
Hey, Wild Card, old buddy.

1342
01:12:06,071 --> 01:12:08,991
Are you in the ship's control room yet?

1343
01:12:09,074 --> 01:12:10,451
[Wild Card] I sure am.

1344
01:12:11,076 --> 01:12:12,786
Just like we planned, old buddy.

1345
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:18,876
Ignore him.

1346
01:12:19,376 --> 01:12:20,794
That's some kind of trick.

1347
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:22,796
I have Wild Card right here.

1348
01:12:26,383 --> 01:12:27,384
Don't I?

1349
01:12:28,969 --> 01:12:30,929
- [squelching]
- [gasps]

1350
01:12:32,222 --> 01:12:33,307
Boo!

1351
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,185
[screeches]

1352
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:39,980
Wow. I gave this plan
50-to-1 odds at best,

1353
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:43,317
but you fell for it
hook, line, and sinker.

1354
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,986
We got the one
with the useless superpower?

1355
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:49,490
Got you far away
from the control center, didn't it?

1356
01:12:50,407 --> 01:12:53,702
Go to the control center, now!
Go, go. Go! Go!

1357
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:55,537
[groans loudly]

1358
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:57,790
[chuckles]

1359
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:00,875
[laughs]

1360
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:02,920
You were working together?

1361
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:04,588
Surprise!

1362
01:13:04,671 --> 01:13:07,132
I even sent him on a secret mission.

1363
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:10,052
Isn't that right, Wild Card?

1364
01:13:10,135 --> 01:13:11,178
Yep!

1365
01:13:11,261 --> 01:13:14,890
And when the team leader tells you
to do something, you hop to it.

1366
01:13:14,973 --> 01:13:17,976
Since when did you accept Missy
as the leader?

1367
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,311
Since the tunnel…

1368
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:22,898
when she told me you
were an alien spy.

1369
01:13:22,981 --> 01:13:25,192
[in unison] Ojo's an alien spy?

1370
01:13:25,275 --> 01:13:27,569
Yep. Ojo's a spy.

1371
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:31,740
You knew.

1372
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:34,701
How'd you figure it out?

1373
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:39,623
You accidentally gave it away
in one of your own drawings.

1374
01:13:39,706 --> 01:13:41,750
Your art never lies.

1375
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:44,878
- [whispers] She's an alien spy.
- Holy… doo doo.

1376
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:50,467
You work for Granada, don't you?

1377
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:53,303
Or does Granada work for you?

1378
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:55,180
They all work for me.

1379
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:58,434
What the…

1380
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:00,144
Ojo's an alien!

1381
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:02,104
[all in unison] We know!

1382
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:05,649
[Wild Card] And now you can be impressed…

1383
01:14:05,732 --> 01:14:06,732
[beeps]

1384
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:08,360
…and defeated…

1385
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:11,738
as soon as I figure out which
button removes the shield.

1386
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:15,826
Knowing the aliens, it's probably a big
button with a picture of a shield on it.

1387
01:14:15,909 --> 01:14:16,909
Oh!

1388
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:22,082
[kids cheer]

1389
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:26,128
I hate to spoil your celebration…

1390
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:29,256
but there's two minutes left.

1391
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:31,550
[timer beeping]

1392
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:34,511
Game's not over yet.

1393
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:46,482
[snarling]

1394
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:48,942

[roars]

1398
01:15:03,248 --> 01:15:04,291
Uh-oh!

1399
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:09,296
[snarling]

1400
01:15:09,379 --> 01:15:10,714
We'll hold it off.

1401
01:15:10,797 --> 01:15:12,925
You find a way to stop the launch.

1402
01:15:18,805 --> 01:15:19,640
[Wheels] Um…

1403
01:15:19,723 --> 01:15:22,851
It's not an it. It's a them!

1404
01:15:23,977 --> 01:15:26,021
[roaring]

1405
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:27,231
Then you better hurry!

1406
01:15:27,981 --> 01:15:29,066
Come on, everyone.

1407
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:31,818
Time to show these guys
what we're made of.

1408
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:33,987
[snarling, roaring]

1409
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:45,916
Come on in. It's broken.

1410
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,543
I mean it's open.

1411
01:15:49,294 --> 01:15:52,005
[Missy] Wild Card,
you have to keep those shields down.

1412
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:53,257
Don't worry, Missy.

1413
01:15:53,924 --> 01:15:54,924
I'm on it.

1414
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:56,093
Oh yeah?

1415
01:15:56,176 --> 01:15:58,136
What are you gonna do, hmm?

1416
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,055
Turn into a bowling ball?

1417
01:16:00,138 --> 01:16:01,138
Sure…

1418
01:16:01,932 --> 01:16:03,642
if that's what I want.

1419
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:05,352
I can control my powers now.

1420
01:16:05,435 --> 01:16:07,354
Working with Missy helped me realize

1421
01:16:07,437 --> 01:16:09,940
I was so busy
trying to prove everyone else wrong

1422
01:16:10,023 --> 01:16:13,110
when I should have been concentrating
on proving myself right.

1423
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:14,695
She believed in me.

1424
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:16,738
Now I believe in myself.

1425
01:16:17,322 --> 01:16:19,491
Oh, right.

1426
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:21,952
And you think that's enough.

1427
01:16:22,494 --> 01:16:24,204
[mockingly] Believing in yourself.

1428
01:16:25,205 --> 01:16:26,456
You tell me.

1429
01:16:29,793 --> 01:16:30,877
Let's do this.

1430
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:32,920
Hmm.

1431
01:16:33,338 --> 01:16:34,464

[exhales slowly]

1614
01:29:05,798 --> 01:29:06,798
What the…

1615
01:29:07,216 --> 01:29:08,760
[chuckling] You're so fast.

1616
01:29:11,137 --> 01:29:12,180
[exhales slowly]

1617
01:29:12,972 --> 01:29:13,973
I love you.

1618
01:29:16,684 --> 01:29:17,977
I love you, too, buddy.

1619
01:29:19,228 --> 01:29:20,313
I love you too.

1620
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:24,734
You're so wonderful together.
I am so proud of you.

1621
01:29:24,817 --> 01:29:26,527
You two make such a great team.

1622

- [repeats] You two make such a great team.

1623
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:40,375
[Fast Forward chuckles]

1624
01:29:41,501 --> 01:29:43,002
Oh yeah! Come on.

1625
01:29:43,586 --> 01:29:45,046
- Hey, Dad! Hey, Grandma!
- Hey.

1626
01:29:45,129 --> 01:29:46,129
Hey!

1627
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:50,760
- [Marcus] Someone's made a few friends.
- I tell you, Marcus, natural-born leader.

1628
01:29:52,011 --> 01:29:53,930
I should get captured more often.

1629
01:29:54,013 --> 01:29:56,474
Nope. Not without me, you're not.

1630
01:29:56,557 --> 01:29:58,893
If you ever go on any other missions,

1631
01:29:58,976 --> 01:30:01,646
I'm gonna be there right by your side.

1632
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:02,729
Deal?

1633
01:30:03,523 --> 01:30:04,857
A deal is…

1634
01:30:05,566 --> 01:30:06,567
a deal.

1635
01:30:07,485 --> 01:30:10,071
- [Missy chuckles] I missed you.
- [grandma chuckles]

[Granada squeals]

1637
01:30:16,953 --> 01:30:19,288
[Missy] This was the day our heroes fell,

1638
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:21,791
but others did rise.

1639
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:25,461
As for the aliens, they'll be back,

1640
01:30:25,962 --> 01:30:29,507
and when they call on us for help,
we will be prepared.

1641
01:30:30,007 --> 01:30:31,926
We will be ready.

1642
01:30:32,009 --> 01:30:33,636
[heroic music plays]

1643
01:30:58,035 --> 01:31:00,413
So what are we supposed to be looking at?

1644
01:31:03,666 --> 01:31:04,750
The future.

1645
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:16,721
