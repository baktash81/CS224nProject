1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
 

2
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,910
My name is Mary Lennox.

3
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,162
I was born in India.

4
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,498
It was hot...and strange...

5
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,167
...and lonely in India.

6
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,003
I didn't like it.

7
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,463
Nobody but my servant...

8
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,841
...my ayah, looked after me.

9
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,677
My parents didn't want me.

10
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,513
My mother cared only to go to parties...

11
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:22,142
...and my fa ther was busy
with his military duties.

12
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,520
I was never allowed to go to the parties.

13
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,398
I watched them
from my mother's bedroom window.

14
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,109
I was angry, but I never cried.

15
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,571
I didn't know how to cry.

16
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,209
-I left my fan. You didn't have to come.
-I wanted to.

17
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,545
My parents always thought
about themselves.

18
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,048
They never thought about me.

19
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,175
If only I could've known...

20
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:40,303
...that in a few moments
I would lose them forever.

21
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,480
Earthquake!

22
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:48,204
The families of the Indian earthquake
orphans should please go to Dock 2.

23
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,212
We're here, Mary! Can you believe it?

24
00:04:56,838 --> 00:05:01,134
She's so sour. I heard that she never cried
when her parents died.

25
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,678
'"Mistress Mary, quite contrary....'"

26
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,315
Numbers 38 and 39...

27
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,526
...George and Amy Brent.

28
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,572
Numbers 40 and 41...

29
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,492
...Timothy and Thomas Burke.

30
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,161
-Here we are!
-Here we are!

31
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,456
Oh, my boys, my boys.

32
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,013
Number 43, Mary Lennox.

33
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,850
'"Mary, Mary, quite contrary

34
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,646
'"How does your garden grow?

35
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,565
'"With silver bells

36
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,734
'"And cockleshells

37
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,445
'"And pretty maids all in a row.'"

38
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,663
Number 43...

39
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,916
...Mary Lennox.

40
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,255
Please, just step aside.

41
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,806
Number 44...

42
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,558
...Adam Snow.

43
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,292
Mary Lennox?

44
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,880
Is that Mary Lennox?

45
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,381
Number 43.

46
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,967
Yes, Mary Lennox.

47
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,802
I've come to claim her.

48
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,598
I'm Mrs. Medlock,
housekeeper of Misslethwaite Manor...

49
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,101
...for the Lord Archibald Craven...

50
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,936
...her uncle and guardian.

51
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,898
What a queer, unresponsive little thing.

52
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:23,109
And, my word, a plain piece of quince.

53
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,278
Her mother was a beauty.

54
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,947
She certainly didn't hand much of it down.

55
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,492
She might improve as she gets older.

56
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,160
Children change.

57
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,788
She'll have to change quite a bit.

58
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,792
There's not much to improve her
at Misslethwaite Manor.

59
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,585
Come along.

60
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:06,069
It's a pity for you that
you haven't any other place to go.

61
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,697
Your uncle won't trouble himself
about you.

62
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,448
That's for sure.

63
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,326
He never troubles himself about anyone.

64
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,495
As if having a crooked back...

65
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:19,916
...wasn't cross enough for a man to bear,
but she had to up and die on him.

66
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:24,212
Your aunt is dead.
Didn't your mother tell you?

67
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,798
Strange.

68
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,051
Not telling you that
her own twin sister was dead.

69
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:33,430
My mother didn't have the time
to tell me stories.

70
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,752
Oh, at last.

71
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,674
There's Misslethwaite.

72
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,387
You'll go straight to bed for a few hours.

73
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,806
You probably haven't gotten much rest.

74
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,970
There's your breakfast.

75
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,181
I'm still in my nightgown.

76
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:02,477
You can change after you eat.
There are new clothes in the wardrobe.

77
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,062
Who'll dress me?

78
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,483
You can't dress yourself?

79
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,902
Of course not. My ayah dressed me.

80
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,320
Nonsense.

81
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,281
As old as you are?

82
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:18,827
What do they do with children in India?
Carry you around in a basket?

83
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,705
How dare you talk to me
with such disrespect!

84
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,292
Nobody's going to carry you
around Misslethwaite Manor.

85
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,712
We've far too much work already.

86
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,257
So you'll have to look after yourself.

87
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,635
There are 100 rooms here.
This one and no other is yours.

88
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,389
Don't expect to see your uncle
because it's certain you won't.

89
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:45,603
You are not to touch anything,
or to go wandering and poking about.

90
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,700
The house seemed dead...

91
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:06,453
...like a spell had been cast upon it.

92
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,945
It lookedjust like my mother's room.

93
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,948
This must have been my aunt's.

94
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:28,034
The dressing tables were the same.

95
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,371
They even had twin ivory elephants.

96
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,841
Mother.

97
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,279
What are you doing? What did I tell you?

98
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:51,785
I heard someone crying.

99
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:52,702
Dogs.

100
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,913
No, someone! A person crying.

101
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,957
You heard nothing of the sort.

102
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:08,968
Now...

103
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,972
...you stay where you are told,
or I'll come and box your ears.

104
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:32,659
Good afternoon.

105
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:35,161
I brought you something to eat.

106
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,416
You haven't touched your porridge.

107
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,543
Didn't you want it?

108
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,962
Are you my servant?

109
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:46,256
I'm Mrs. Medlock's servant.

110
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,675
She's Lord Craven's.

111
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:54,014
But I'll be doing the housemaid's work
up here and waiting on you a bit.

112
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:57,017
Waiting on me makes you my servant then.

113
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,689
You are strange.

114
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,566
Hey, I know that.

115
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:09,529
Mrs. Medlock gave me the place
out of kindness to me mother.

116
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:14,826
She said she could never have done it
if there was a grand missus here.

117
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:19,205
I'd never be let out of the kitchens...

118
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,708
...and certainly not upstairs.

119
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,335
Stop it!

120
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,253
What're you doing?

121
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:28,214
I thought all girls liked to be tickled.

122
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,806
What would you like to wear?

123
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,641
Black...

124
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,269
...black or black?

125
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:43,730
Are you blind?

126
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,774
They're all black.

127
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,528
And I won't be laughed at, servant.

128
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,739
My name's Martha.

129
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,786
I won't tickle you. I promise.

130
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,587
What do they wear in India?

131
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:11,174
When I heard you were coming,
I thought you'd be a native.

132
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,427
What?

133
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,639
You thought I was a what? You....

134
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,516
You....

135
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:21,601
You daughter of a pig!

136
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,189
You needn't be like that.
I've nothing against natives.

137
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,817
My mother says all of us are family.

138
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,360
I've never seen a native.

139
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,861
I was pleased to think I was.

140
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:35,573
You don't know anything about anything!
None of you know nothing!

141
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,873
Please.

142
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,918
Don't be vexed.

143
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:50,213
I don't know anything about anything...

144
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,465
...like you said.

145
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,135
I'm sorry, miss.

146
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:58,179
I'm too common and I talk too much.

147
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:01,307
I beg your pardon, miss.

148
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:22,245
I don't know when exactly
your uncle will call for you.

149
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,247
My uncle?

150
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,167
Mrs. Medlock said
he wouldn't want to see me.

151
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:30,712
But he does.

152
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,451
Your uncle's decided not to see you today.

153
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,244
When will I see him?

154
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,704
Tomorrow?

155
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:06,706
No. He'll be gone tomorrow.

156
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,900
After the mistress died ten years ago...

157
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,528
...Lord Craven wouldn't see people.

158
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,322
There's nobody to ease his sorrow.

159
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,534
He spends most of his time
away from home now.

160
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,244
Poor man.

161
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:45,870
They say he's cursed.

162
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:50,834
Better put your sweater on.
It's cold outside.

163
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:53,128
But I've got no one to play with.

164
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:55,130
No one to play with?

165
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:56,965
Let me out of here.

166
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,883
Dickon, my brother...

167
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,053
...goes up on the moor
by himself for hours.

168
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:06,808
That's how he made friends
with all his animals.

169
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:08,351
Who?

170
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:10,061
Dickon...

171
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:11,938
...me younger brother.

172
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:12,981
Pull it down!

173
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:15,734
You have no idea
how curious he is about you.

174
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:18,278
What do you think you're doing?

175
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:19,863
There you are!

176
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,073
I wondered where you'd gone.

177
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:25,410
What do you mean?
You knew perfectly well where I was.

178
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,203
Your scarf, miss.

179
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,334
There.

180
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,879
Thou is ready to go out now.

181
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,672
I can't see.

182
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,813
To get to the gardens...

183
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:56,524
...you must go through there...

184
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:59,361
...then around the outside of the house.

185
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:01,946
Run along now. Have fun.

186
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:22,527
What's beyond there?

187
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:25,113
Another garden?

188
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,455
Where's the door?

189
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:55,977
You there!

190
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:07,072
-Where's the door to that other garden?
-What?

191
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:10,950
The one with all the ivy.
I didn't see a door.

192
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:12,494
There isn't one.

193
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:14,454
There has to be a door somewhere.

194
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:17,665
No one's been inside that place
for ten years.

195
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:18,958
Why?

196
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:20,085
Why?

197
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:25,048
Because when she died, the master
gave orders to shut it up forever.

198
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:26,591
Who died?

199
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:31,596
My aunt died.

200
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:36,851
It was her garden, wasn't it?

201
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:39,688
Look at me.

202
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:42,399
Answer me, you!

203
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:46,611
It's revolting how these people
behave toward me.

204
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:51,366
Of course...

205
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:53,785
...orders couldn't keep him out.

206
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:59,082
He's the only one goes in there nowadays.

207
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:07,716
If you know the way...

208
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,092
...show me.

209
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:19,519
Who's there?

210
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,085
He hates it.

211
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:46,588
Why does Lord Craven hate her garden?

212
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:49,507
-We're not supposed to talk about it.
-Why not?

213
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:51,676
I've got a present for you.

214
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:55,138
Mother sent it over to you.

215
00:25:58,058 --> 00:25:59,059
What's it for?

216
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:02,771
You mean, all they've got is
elephants and tigers in India?

217
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:05,440
They've not got skipping ropes?

218
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:08,193
Come here.

219
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:10,236
Watch.

220
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:21,039
Now, you try.

221
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,361
Thank you, Martha. Thank your mother.

222
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:53,113
You are strange.

223
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:56,032
If you'd been any other child...

224
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:59,577
-...you'd have given me a kiss.
-Do you want me to kiss you?

225
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:02,664
What's that?

226
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:04,499
Go on now, Miss Mary.

227
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,085
Go, go.

228
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:11,381
I've never skipped before.

229
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:14,426
Well, he's impressed.

230
00:27:15,343 --> 00:27:17,929
Cheeky little beggar. Look at him.

231
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:20,390
What about him?

232
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:22,434
I can't think why, but...

233
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:25,353
...he's decided to make friends with thee.

234
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:28,565
He has?

235
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:32,277
I've never had any friends.

236
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:34,279
That I believe.

237
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:39,034
Show me.

238
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:41,161
Please show me the way in.

239
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:39,427
Thank you, robin.

240
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:55,944
I need more.... Martha!

241
00:28:56,528 --> 00:28:59,114
I need more plasters! More towels!

242
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:48,867
Did you see what I found, pretty robin?

243
00:32:37,832 --> 00:32:40,877
You're getting on well enough
with that this morning.

244
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,420
Tastes nice today.

245
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:45,715
Listen.

246
00:32:47,592 --> 00:32:48,927
Hear that?

247
00:32:49,594 --> 00:32:51,096
It's the wind.

248
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:55,433
Sometimes it sounds like
someone's lost out in the moor...

249
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,394
...and crying.

250
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:02,691
Poor little Betty Butterworth...

251
00:33:03,316 --> 00:33:05,026
...the scullery maid.

252
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:07,570
She's had a toothache all morning.

253
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:10,907
I need your help. Come on.
Get this child outside at once!

254
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,701
Come on, Martha, please!

255
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:25,547
Soot.

256
00:33:28,258 --> 00:33:30,093
He doesn't know thee. You frightened him.

257
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:31,886
I frightened him?

258
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:33,054
Come.

259
00:33:33,138 --> 00:33:34,639
He won't hurt you.

260
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:37,809
-He'll bite me.
-He won't.

261
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,061
But he's filthy and dirty.

262
00:33:40,145 --> 00:33:42,522
No, he's soft. You'll like it.

263
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:48,236
There. I did it.

264
00:34:05,003 --> 00:34:06,629
Like that, Miss Mary.

265
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:09,966
I know you, too.
You're Martha's brother, Dickon.

266
00:34:23,897 --> 00:34:26,191
The robin says he's been waiting for you.

267
00:34:26,274 --> 00:34:28,568
The animals tell me all their secrets.

268
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:30,570
He wouldn't tell you my secret.

269
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:32,530
About what, Miss Mary?

270
00:34:34,282 --> 00:34:35,617
A garden.

271
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,786
I've stolen a garden.

272
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:39,913
Maybe it's dead, anyhow.

273
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:41,915
-I don't know.
-I'd know.

274
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:48,588
Promise you won't tell?

275
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:49,964
Promise.

276
00:34:50,382 --> 00:34:51,549
Nobody?

277
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:52,884
Not a soul.

278
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:55,303
It's a secret garden.

279
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:57,389
Secrets are safe with me.

280
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:03,687
-And you'll know if it's alive?
-'Course.

281
00:35:05,355 --> 00:35:06,523
Wait here.

282
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:28,753
This garden's not dead.

283
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,006
It's as alive as you or me.

284
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:35,135
See? This part's wick.

285
00:35:35,593 --> 00:35:36,928
See the green?

286
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,638
Wick?

287
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:40,098
What's wick?

288
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,516
Alive.

289
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,851
Full of life.

290
00:35:44,102 --> 00:35:46,855
There'll be so many roses
in there this summer...

291
00:35:46,938 --> 00:35:48,732
...you'll be sick of them.

292
00:35:49,149 --> 00:35:50,316
Look!

293
00:36:00,368 --> 00:36:03,371
There's a picture of my mother
and my aunt sitting here.

294
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:05,373
They say that's how she died.

295
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:06,583
How?

296
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,543
From falling off it.

297
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,900
For the first time since coming from India...

298
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:34,235
...I dreamed about my mother.

299
00:36:34,986 --> 00:36:36,279
She was here...

300
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:38,114
...in the garden...

301
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:40,450
...and the garden was ajungle.

302
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:43,078
Come to me.

303
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:50,413
Are you a ghost?

304
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:54,501
Are you?

305
00:38:56,628 --> 00:38:58,088
Who are you?

306
00:38:58,463 --> 00:39:00,131
What are you doing here?

307
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:01,966
I live here.

308
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:03,551
Who are you?

309
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:06,346
I'm master of this house,
while my father's away.

310
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:07,889
Your father?

311
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,308
He's my uncle.

312
00:39:10,475 --> 00:39:12,686
Nobody told me he had a son.

313
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:14,187
Come here.

314
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:44,134
What's your name?

315
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,678
I'm Mary Lennox.

316
00:39:47,429 --> 00:39:48,847
What's your name?

317
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:50,306
I'm Colin Craven.

318
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,934
Our mother's were sisters. Twins.

319
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:54,310
Twins?

320
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,689
Nobody told me she had a twin.

321
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,776
-Why were you crying?
-I can't sleep.

322
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:05,572
Plump my pillows for me, Cousin Mary.

323
00:40:06,489 --> 00:40:08,158
-What?
-My pillows.

324
00:40:08,867 --> 00:40:10,660
My covers got twisted.

325
00:40:12,495 --> 00:40:14,873
I don't know what to do about it.

326
00:40:15,457 --> 00:40:17,834
-I'll get Martha, or Mrs. Medlock.
-No!

327
00:40:19,753 --> 00:40:21,004
Why not?

328
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:24,716
Medlock wouldn't allow you in here.

329
00:40:26,426 --> 00:40:28,553
She'd be afraid you'd upset me...

330
00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:31,723
...and make me more ill.

331
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,808
-Do I? I'll go.
-Stop!

332
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:35,643
Stay here!

333
00:40:36,144 --> 00:40:37,729
How old are you?

334
00:40:38,146 --> 00:40:39,147
Ten.

335
00:40:40,106 --> 00:40:41,566
We're the same age.

336
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:45,320
What's your mother like?

337
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:48,740
She's dead.

338
00:40:49,616 --> 00:40:51,076
Mine's dead, too.

339
00:40:52,744 --> 00:40:54,329
Do you see that cord?

340
00:40:55,497 --> 00:40:56,664
Pull it.

341
00:41:06,174 --> 00:41:07,676
That's my mother.

342
00:41:07,926 --> 00:41:10,428
My father never wants to see me
because...

343
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:13,890
...I don't look anything like her.

344
00:41:13,973 --> 00:41:15,767
But you, you look like her.

345
00:41:18,561 --> 00:41:20,772
Why do you keep a curtain over her?

346
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:22,524
She smiles too much.

347
00:41:22,607 --> 00:41:24,275
Smiles too much?

348
00:41:24,943 --> 00:41:27,320
How can anybody smile too much?

349
00:41:28,697 --> 00:41:30,281
Sometimes I hate her.

350
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:34,035
-She died when I was born.
-I thought she died in her garden.

351
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:35,370
Garden?

352
00:41:35,787 --> 00:41:36,955
What garden?

353
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:38,790
Oh, just a garden.

354
00:41:38,873 --> 00:41:40,875
There are so many of them here.

355
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:42,544
-Are there?
-Of course.

356
00:41:42,752 --> 00:41:44,045
Don't you go outside?

357
00:41:44,129 --> 00:41:45,130
Never.

358
00:41:45,296 --> 00:41:46,715
What's wrong with you?

359
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:48,216
I'm going to die.

360
00:41:48,633 --> 00:41:49,801
From what?

361
00:41:50,176 --> 00:41:51,386
Everything.

362
00:41:51,553 --> 00:41:53,555
I've spent my whole life in this bed.

363
00:41:53,638 --> 00:41:55,473
You don't know how to walk?

364
00:41:55,807 --> 00:41:57,142
You are real?

365
00:41:58,143 --> 00:42:00,186
My dreams are so real sometimes.

366
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:02,272
Shall I pinch you to prove it?

367
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:09,821
See?

368
00:43:01,873 --> 00:43:03,875
How did you know to pull the weeds?

369
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:07,671
It looked like it was strangling.
I don't even know what it is.

370
00:43:07,962 --> 00:43:10,632
A lily. It's an Empress-of-India lily.

371
00:43:10,715 --> 00:43:12,092
Empress of India?

372
00:43:12,175 --> 00:43:14,052
These bulbs are lilies, too.

373
00:43:15,553 --> 00:43:18,014
We'll plant them all around your lily.

374
00:43:18,098 --> 00:43:20,141
She'll have her own ladies in waiting.

375
00:43:20,225 --> 00:43:21,643
It's just like the rhyme:

376
00:43:21,726 --> 00:43:23,978
'"Mistress Mary, quite contrary

377
00:43:24,062 --> 00:43:26,064
'"How does your garden grow?

378
00:43:26,189 --> 00:43:27,941
'"With silver bells and cockleshells

379
00:43:28,024 --> 00:43:30,068
'"And pretty maids all in a row.'"

380
00:43:32,195 --> 00:43:36,032
On the boat coming here,
they used to sing that song at me.

381
00:43:37,826 --> 00:43:39,994
I wasn't as contrary as they were.

382
00:43:47,836 --> 00:43:49,754
I met my cousin last night.

383
00:43:51,089 --> 00:43:52,757
You've seen Colin?

384
00:43:53,341 --> 00:43:55,051
Did you know about him?

385
00:43:55,427 --> 00:43:57,554
Everybody knows about him.

386
00:43:57,637 --> 00:43:59,639
But hardly anybody's seen him.

387
00:43:59,848 --> 00:44:02,517
He said his mother died when he was born.

388
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:04,561
She fell off the swing.

389
00:44:04,644 --> 00:44:05,937
He was born too soon.

390
00:44:06,021 --> 00:44:07,856
He's not at all like you.

391
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:10,859
His cheeks are whiter than ice and marble.

392
00:44:11,735 --> 00:44:13,528
Whiter than these little hairs.

393
00:44:13,611 --> 00:44:15,113
Those are the roots.

394
00:44:15,613 --> 00:44:17,115
Set it in there.

395
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:29,044
Let it grow this way, Miss Mary.

396
00:44:47,062 --> 00:44:49,189
How tiresome to be shut indoors.

397
00:44:49,647 --> 00:44:51,149
It's too stuffy!

398
00:44:52,275 --> 00:44:55,653
I'll faint if I don't get
some light and fresh air.

399
00:44:57,989 --> 00:45:00,158
At least we can open the windows.

400
00:45:01,576 --> 00:45:03,495
No, get away from there!

401
00:45:03,578 --> 00:45:04,996
Don't touch them.

402
00:45:05,163 --> 00:45:06,664
They're nailed shut.

403
00:45:06,748 --> 00:45:09,042
My lungs can't take the spores.

404
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,251
Spores?

405
00:45:10,335 --> 00:45:14,172
The wind carries them. When you
breathe the air, you swallow them.

406
00:45:14,255 --> 00:45:15,799
They get stuck in your lungs.

407
00:45:15,882 --> 00:45:19,636
Before I got out into the wind,
even my hair was scrawny.

408
00:45:19,844 --> 00:45:21,221
Your hair?

409
00:45:21,471 --> 00:45:23,807
-Hair is dead.
-If hair is dead...

410
00:45:24,015 --> 00:45:27,102
...then how come it keeps growing
even after you die?

411
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:31,022
Well, maybe not your hair!
By then you might be bald.

412
00:45:31,356 --> 00:45:33,024
Don't be stupid.

413
00:45:33,525 --> 00:45:36,236
I'll be dead before I'm old enough
to be bald.

414
00:45:36,528 --> 00:45:39,114
I'll get a lump on my back like my father.

415
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,699
Then I'll die.

416
00:45:42,367 --> 00:45:44,494
I hate how you talk about dying.

417
00:45:45,161 --> 00:45:46,621
Everyone thinks I'll die.

418
00:45:46,705 --> 00:45:50,041
If everyone thought that about me,
I wouldn't do it.

419
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:52,419
Here.

420
00:45:52,585 --> 00:45:53,753
Put this on.

421
00:45:53,878 --> 00:45:56,631
Everyone has to wear one.
Medlock's orders.

422
00:45:56,923 --> 00:45:59,843
-But she's not here to see me.
-Put it on.

423
00:46:03,722 --> 00:46:05,640
It makes my face itch.

424
00:46:06,891 --> 00:46:10,645
I can't stand it!
I didn't give you any germs last night!

425
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,648
Put on the mask.

426
00:46:14,315 --> 00:46:18,945
Stop talking to me as if you were a rajah
with jewels stuck all over you.

427
00:46:19,237 --> 00:46:21,406
I'll talk to you any way I please.

428
00:46:22,949 --> 00:46:24,242
Where are you going?

429
00:46:24,325 --> 00:46:26,411
Back outside to be with Dickon.

430
00:46:27,245 --> 00:46:30,123
He tames animals like the animal charmers
in India.

431
00:46:30,206 --> 00:46:32,667
He knows everything about gardens.

432
00:46:32,751 --> 00:46:35,086
Does he know about my mother's garden?

433
00:46:35,378 --> 00:46:37,797
-What?
-You said my mother had a garden.

434
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:41,301
How would he know about it?
It's locked. No one's allowed in there.

435
00:46:41,384 --> 00:46:43,636
-I'll make them unlock it.
-No, don't do that.

436
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,013
Why not?

437
00:46:45,638 --> 00:46:49,225
If you make them open the door like that,
if everyone knows...

438
00:46:49,351 --> 00:46:51,603
...it wouldn't be a secret anymore.

439
00:46:51,811 --> 00:46:54,939
Don't you see how much better it is
if it's a secret?

440
00:46:55,607 --> 00:46:58,818
You have to.
Maybe you can't even keep a secret.

441
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:09,037
Master Colin, we've brought the machine
for your legs.

442
00:47:09,204 --> 00:47:10,372
I don't want it.

443
00:47:10,455 --> 00:47:12,457
Now, don't be like that.

444
00:47:12,624 --> 00:47:15,960
You know how important it is
for your circulation.

445
00:47:19,631 --> 00:47:22,467
I've got some nice, fresh flannels, too.

446
00:47:43,988 --> 00:47:45,699
Your father returns today.

447
00:47:45,782 --> 00:47:47,450
He won't want to see me.

448
00:47:47,826 --> 00:47:49,494
Perhaps he will.

449
00:47:59,295 --> 00:48:01,548
The machine. Wake up, girl!

450
00:48:07,262 --> 00:48:09,180
Oh, I forgot my herbs.

451
00:48:09,556 --> 00:48:11,433
-I'll get them for you.
-No, thank you.

452
00:48:11,516 --> 00:48:15,186
Last time, you brought too many roots
and almost no leaves.

453
00:48:19,566 --> 00:48:22,444
What are you doing down there,
Miss Mary?

454
00:48:24,362 --> 00:48:25,780
Where's your mask?

455
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:28,533
If Mrs. Medlock finds out....

456
00:48:28,867 --> 00:48:30,869
The world's coming to an end.

457
00:48:30,952 --> 00:48:32,454
She won't let you come back.

458
00:48:32,537 --> 00:48:36,124
But you're master until your father
gets home, you could make her--

459
00:48:36,207 --> 00:48:37,709
Go! Just go!

460
00:48:38,376 --> 00:48:40,337
She'll think I disobeyed her.

461
00:48:40,587 --> 00:48:42,339
She'll fire me for sure.

462
00:48:42,881 --> 00:48:44,341
Please! Go!

463
00:48:55,393 --> 00:48:57,979
His Lordship's arrived! He's here!

464
00:49:21,878 --> 00:49:23,755
Come along, Miss Mary.

465
00:49:32,013 --> 00:49:33,264
Come along.

466
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:53,785
Miss Mary, Your Lordship.

467
00:50:03,128 --> 00:50:04,295
Calm down.

468
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,388
Come here.

469
00:50:22,897 --> 00:50:24,649
You needn't be afraid.

470
00:50:25,483 --> 00:50:26,651
Come here.

471
00:50:40,915 --> 00:50:42,167
My God!

472
00:50:47,172 --> 00:50:48,340
Your eyes!

473
00:50:49,007 --> 00:50:50,675
They're so much....

474
00:50:53,011 --> 00:50:54,554
I had no idea.

475
00:50:59,684 --> 00:51:01,186
Wait a moment.

476
00:51:11,154 --> 00:51:12,989
They never sent me your picture.

477
00:51:13,073 --> 00:51:15,784
Mother had no time
to get my picture taken.

478
00:51:31,299 --> 00:51:35,053
Medlock wants me to send you
to some sort of boarding school.

479
00:51:36,596 --> 00:51:38,473
Please. Let me stay.

480
00:51:39,307 --> 00:51:40,767
I don't do any harm.

481
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:42,018
Harm?

482
00:51:44,979 --> 00:51:46,898
What harm could you do?

483
00:51:49,901 --> 00:51:51,986
There's nothing for a child here.

484
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:53,655
I don't need much.

485
00:51:55,323 --> 00:51:56,908
All I need is....

486
00:51:59,577 --> 00:52:00,829
Could I...?

487
00:52:02,414 --> 00:52:04,165
Could I have a bit of earth?

488
00:52:04,249 --> 00:52:05,375
Bit of earth?

489
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:07,085
To plant seeds in.

490
00:52:07,377 --> 00:52:09,212
To make things grow.

491
00:52:19,681 --> 00:52:21,599
Take your bit of earth.

492
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:26,688
Don't be foolish and expect anything
to come of it.

493
00:52:26,771 --> 00:52:29,524
May I take it from anywhere
so long as it's not wanted?

494
00:52:29,607 --> 00:52:30,942
Anywhere!

495
00:52:34,446 --> 00:52:36,197
Well.... Go! Go!

496
00:52:36,656 --> 00:52:37,866
You can go.

497
00:52:38,867 --> 00:52:40,702
Good-bye. Good-bye.

498
00:52:41,786 --> 00:52:43,747
I'll be away until the winter.

499
00:52:55,342 --> 00:52:56,468
He said I can!

500
00:52:56,551 --> 00:52:58,219
I can have my bit of earth!

501
00:52:58,303 --> 00:52:59,262
Who said?

502
00:52:59,346 --> 00:53:04,142
My uncle. I asked him and he said '"yes.'"
I can plant seeds anywhere I like.

503
00:53:05,185 --> 00:53:07,228
Blue flowers, pink flowers...

504
00:53:07,312 --> 00:53:09,230
...purple flowers, yellow flowers...

505
00:53:09,314 --> 00:53:12,317
...cornflowers, foxgloves,
any kind we want.

506
00:53:15,653 --> 00:53:17,155
It's raining.

507
00:53:27,082 --> 00:53:29,417
The rain will help our flowers grow.

508
00:53:36,341 --> 00:53:39,969
In India when it rained,
my ayah would tell me stories.

509
00:53:41,304 --> 00:53:45,225
In one of the stories there was a god
who reminds me of you.

510
00:53:45,558 --> 00:53:47,102
When he was growing up...

511
00:53:47,185 --> 00:53:50,814
...he had to be kept a secret,
so no one would see him.

512
00:53:51,106 --> 00:53:52,357
Really?

513
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:56,945
-Why?
-Because his uncle wanted to kill him.

514
00:53:58,196 --> 00:54:01,366
His uncle dreamed the young god
would take over heaven.

515
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:04,619
-Where did he hide?
-He lived with some cows.

516
00:54:08,373 --> 00:54:10,542
Was he different from other people?

517
00:54:10,667 --> 00:54:12,460
Only on the inside.

518
00:54:12,627 --> 00:54:15,714
When you looked down his throat
you could see the universe.

519
00:54:15,797 --> 00:54:18,758
The universe couldn't fit
down anybody's throat.

520
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:20,635
Down his it could.

521
00:54:21,094 --> 00:54:22,220
How?

522
00:54:22,846 --> 00:54:27,475
He'd have to be bigger than the whole
universe to fit it down his throat.

523
00:54:27,726 --> 00:54:31,312
You said he looked like everybody else
on the outside.

524
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:34,566
That's right. It's inside
that he was different.

525
00:54:35,066 --> 00:54:38,236
-It doesn't make sense.
-It doesn't have to make sense.

526
00:54:38,653 --> 00:54:40,113
It's the idea of it.

527
00:54:40,196 --> 00:54:41,740
It's so stupid.

528
00:54:41,906 --> 00:54:45,368
-No, it's not. It's magic.
-You can't be that stupid.

529
00:54:45,493 --> 00:54:46,995
I am not stupid!

530
00:54:47,412 --> 00:54:49,956
You don't understand. You don't want to!

531
00:54:50,749 --> 00:54:52,000
You can't leave!

532
00:54:52,083 --> 00:54:53,585
You wouldn't dare!

533
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:54,961
Wouldn't I?

534
00:54:55,086 --> 00:54:58,340
-I'll have them drag you back in.
-Will you, Mr. Rajah?

535
00:54:59,424 --> 00:55:00,467
Fine.

536
00:55:00,592 --> 00:55:02,302
That's just fine.

537
00:55:03,094 --> 00:55:04,846
Then I won't even look at you.

538
00:55:04,929 --> 00:55:06,973
I'll stare at the floor.

539
00:55:07,307 --> 00:55:10,935
I'll clench my teeth together
and never tell you one thing.

540
00:55:11,144 --> 00:55:13,021
Not even about seeing your father.

541
00:55:13,104 --> 00:55:14,439
Yes, you will.

542
00:55:15,023 --> 00:55:16,191
Tell me.

543
00:55:19,277 --> 00:55:21,112
He didn't come to see me.

544
00:55:21,696 --> 00:55:23,490
I'll die 'cause he doesn't like me.

545
00:55:23,573 --> 00:55:24,741
He likes me.

546
00:55:24,949 --> 00:55:26,409
But he's my father!

547
00:55:26,576 --> 00:55:28,203
Maybe if you weren't so rude.

548
00:55:28,286 --> 00:55:29,621
I'm not rude!

549
00:55:30,205 --> 00:55:32,540
Yes, you are! You're so sour!

550
00:55:33,124 --> 00:55:36,336
You won't even open your windows
and let the sunshine in.

551
00:55:36,419 --> 00:55:38,546
How can I? It's raining out.

552
00:55:38,713 --> 00:55:42,133
-Even if it weren't raining.
-If it weren't raining, maybe I would.

553
00:55:42,217 --> 00:55:44,969
-You never have.
-Does that mean I never would?

554
00:55:45,053 --> 00:55:46,554
I'm not sour.

555
00:55:53,144 --> 00:55:55,146
Will he ever see Colin?

556
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:59,943
-He's afraid to fall in love with him.
-He's afraid to love his son?

557
00:56:00,068 --> 00:56:03,530
Sometimes when he's here,
he stays alone for a week.

558
00:56:06,324 --> 00:56:08,493
But Colin wants to see him.

559
00:56:09,869 --> 00:56:12,038
Sometimes, he stays longer.

560
00:56:13,707 --> 00:56:15,458
Longer than a week?

561
00:56:16,543 --> 00:56:17,669
Ten years ago...

562
00:56:17,752 --> 00:56:21,256
...when his wife died,
he locked himself in for over a month.

563
00:56:22,007 --> 00:56:25,468
Colin was such a weak baby,
everyone thought he'd die.

564
00:56:25,677 --> 00:56:30,265
His father couldn't bear losing him, too.
He'd suffered so much already.

565
00:57:06,551 --> 00:57:08,303
My poor little boy.

566
00:57:29,866 --> 00:57:34,329
That was the night the rain stopped,
the night spring came to Misslethwaite.

567
00:57:37,582 --> 00:57:39,668
My poor uncle fled from it...

568
00:57:39,918 --> 00:57:42,253
...as if he were escaping the spring.

569
00:59:21,102 --> 00:59:22,395
Medlock's gone!

570
00:59:22,479 --> 00:59:25,190
It's working. It's working any minute now.

571
00:59:28,526 --> 00:59:29,778
Hold, Dickon!

572
00:59:29,861 --> 00:59:31,696
Hold! It's working!

573
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,324
Come down! We need a hand.

574
00:59:36,659 --> 00:59:39,204
It's beautiful, Colin. Do you feel it?

575
00:59:39,454 --> 00:59:40,705
Do you?

576
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:45,335
I'm coming!

577
00:59:52,342 --> 00:59:55,136
What about the spores?
Can you see them?

578
01:00:23,581 --> 01:00:24,791
Jesus.

579
01:00:25,417 --> 01:00:27,293
Come help me, please.

580
01:00:33,174 --> 01:00:34,759
Put him on the bed.

581
01:00:46,438 --> 01:00:49,816
Calm yourself, Master Colin.
Please, just calm down!

582
01:00:49,941 --> 01:00:52,736
Calm down. See if Mrs. Medlock's back.

583
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,405
Calm down!

584
01:00:55,488 --> 01:00:57,240
Calm down, please!

585
01:01:01,619 --> 01:01:04,497
Miss Mary, please, don't go in there now.

586
01:01:05,457 --> 01:01:08,585
He's having a dreadful fit.
Lord knows what he'll do.

587
01:01:08,668 --> 01:01:12,088
I don't care. He's so spoiled,
he must be stopped.

588
01:01:12,339 --> 01:01:14,382
Somebody's got to make him stop.

589
01:01:16,885 --> 01:01:19,387
Stop it, you! Stop! I hate you!

590
01:01:20,263 --> 01:01:22,098
Everybody hates you!

591
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:25,560
You're so selfish! You're the most selfish
boy there ever was!

592
01:01:25,643 --> 01:01:27,687
I'm not as selfish as you are.

593
01:01:27,937 --> 01:01:29,189
Because I'm always ill.

594
01:01:29,272 --> 01:01:31,483
Nobody ill can scream like that.

595
01:01:31,608 --> 01:01:33,068
I'm going to die!

596
01:01:33,151 --> 01:01:34,903
What do you know about dying?

597
01:01:34,986 --> 01:01:37,530
-My mother died!
-Both my parents died!

598
01:01:37,655 --> 01:01:41,576
I'll get a lump on my back.
I'll get a lump like my father's!

599
01:01:57,509 --> 01:01:59,427
It's Master Colin! It's Master Colin!

600
01:01:59,511 --> 01:02:02,055
Come quickly, John. Come quickly.

601
01:02:09,938 --> 01:02:12,273
There's nothing but your bones
sticking out.

602
01:02:12,357 --> 01:02:14,484
It's because you're so skinny.

603
01:02:14,943 --> 01:02:16,736
What in God's name?

604
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:19,280
Get away from him, beastly girl!
You'll kill him!

605
01:02:19,364 --> 01:02:20,990
-I won't hurt him!
-She's my cousin!

606
01:02:21,074 --> 01:02:22,659
Give me a hand.

607
01:02:23,284 --> 01:02:24,911
Hold his arms up.

608
01:02:26,287 --> 01:02:27,997
Martha, stop that girl!

609
01:02:28,289 --> 01:02:30,083
He doesn't have a lump!

610
01:02:31,084 --> 01:02:33,920
-You let that wretched girl in here?
-No, ma'am.

611
01:02:34,587 --> 01:02:36,006
You disobeyed me!

612
01:02:36,965 --> 01:02:39,592
You are done for.
You can hie yourself home.

613
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:41,928
But I didn't tell her.

614
01:02:42,554 --> 01:02:43,596
What's going on?

615
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,975
I'll send you away
if you dare think of making her go!

616
01:02:47,058 --> 01:02:50,353
Now, get out of here!
I want to be alone with my cousin.

617
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:51,813
Beg your pardon?

618
01:02:51,896 --> 01:02:54,107
I'm ordering you to leave this room!

619
01:02:54,232 --> 01:02:55,442
Ordering me?

620
01:02:57,318 --> 01:02:58,403
Go!

621
01:03:00,155 --> 01:03:01,322
I shall.

622
01:03:02,157 --> 01:03:06,619
If only to prevent you from harming
yourself with this hysterical shrieking.

623
01:03:08,329 --> 01:03:10,081
But, I promise you....

624
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:19,924
Maybe I'm not ill.

625
01:03:20,133 --> 01:03:21,634
I don't see how.

626
01:03:22,052 --> 01:03:23,595
You're just weak.

627
01:03:26,097 --> 01:03:28,224
Do you think I could go outside?

628
01:03:28,433 --> 01:03:29,684
Spores and all?

629
01:03:29,768 --> 01:03:31,978
I don't know anything about spores.

630
01:03:33,813 --> 01:03:35,440
If I went out...

631
01:03:35,774 --> 01:03:39,319
...maybe we could find the door
to my mother's garden.

632
01:03:39,611 --> 01:03:41,488
If we found the door...

633
01:03:42,155 --> 01:03:43,948
...we could go inside.

634
01:03:50,288 --> 01:03:51,623
What is it?

635
01:03:53,708 --> 01:03:55,543
I didn't dare tell you.

636
01:03:55,794 --> 01:03:58,963
I didn't because I was so afraid
I couldn't trust you.

637
01:03:59,297 --> 01:04:00,465
What?

638
01:04:01,883 --> 01:04:03,885
I've been in the secret garden.

639
01:04:04,135 --> 01:04:06,179
I found the key weeks ago.

640
01:04:06,304 --> 01:04:07,889
Go on. Tell me.

641
01:04:09,224 --> 01:04:11,976
When you open the door,
you can't see anything.

642
01:04:13,019 --> 01:04:15,230
Then you go down some stone steps.

643
01:04:16,022 --> 01:04:19,984
By the time you reach the bottom,
you're surrounded by flowers.

644
01:04:20,235 --> 01:04:22,320
Every day, new flowers open.

645
01:04:22,904 --> 01:04:24,364
It's like magic.

646
01:04:25,365 --> 01:04:27,492
Baby animals are being born.

647
01:04:39,254 --> 01:04:41,256
I'm going out in my chair.

648
01:04:42,549 --> 01:04:44,676
If the fresh air agrees with me...

649
01:04:44,801 --> 01:04:46,678
...I may go out every day.

650
01:04:47,387 --> 01:04:50,015
Not every day, surely, Master Colin.

651
01:04:51,182 --> 01:04:53,768
When I go, nobody is to be anywhere near.

652
01:04:54,853 --> 01:04:58,064
None of the staff, not a single gardener.
Is that clear?

653
01:05:02,861 --> 01:05:04,446
What do they say in India...

654
01:05:04,529 --> 01:05:06,531
...when you want people to go?

655
01:05:06,823 --> 01:05:08,116
You say:

656
01:05:08,742 --> 01:05:11,036
'"I have spoken. All depart.'"

657
01:05:13,413 --> 01:05:14,956
I have spoken.

658
01:05:15,415 --> 01:05:16,833
All depart.

659
01:05:19,711 --> 01:05:21,212
But remember...

660
01:05:21,796 --> 01:05:23,465
...this is very important.

661
01:05:23,548 --> 01:05:24,924
Step back.

662
01:05:35,226 --> 01:05:37,187
You are to stay here, Medlock.

663
01:05:37,395 --> 01:05:39,773
-Oh, but Master Colin--
-Stay here!

664
01:05:56,122 --> 01:05:58,333
Just take these stupid things off!

665
01:05:58,416 --> 01:06:00,251
What good are they now?

666
01:06:00,543 --> 01:06:01,920
Get inside.

667
01:06:07,759 --> 01:06:09,719
-Are these your animals?
-Yes.

668
01:06:17,852 --> 01:06:19,187
It's safe.

669
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:21,648
Go fast, Dickon! Faster! Faster!

670
01:06:25,819 --> 01:06:27,862
Faster, Dickon! Faster!

671
01:06:31,449 --> 01:06:32,617
Faster!

672
01:06:34,911 --> 01:06:36,162
Faster!

673
01:06:45,088 --> 01:06:46,423
Here we go.

674
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,031
Go along, Honker.

675
01:07:12,323 --> 01:07:13,700
I wish I could help.

676
01:07:13,783 --> 01:07:16,911
Don't worry. We'll have you walking
before you know it.

677
01:07:16,995 --> 01:07:18,371
Me? Walk?

678
01:07:19,539 --> 01:07:20,790
Do you think I could?

679
01:07:20,874 --> 01:07:23,335
You have legs like everybody else.

680
01:07:25,086 --> 01:07:26,463
But I never thought I--

681
01:07:26,546 --> 01:07:28,381
Close your eyes, Colin.

682
01:07:32,177 --> 01:07:33,470
Am I there?

683
01:07:33,553 --> 01:07:34,804
Almost.

684
01:07:39,601 --> 01:07:40,727
Now.

685
01:07:51,571 --> 01:07:52,697
Yes.

686
01:07:54,032 --> 01:07:55,700
I imagined this.

687
01:08:41,037 --> 01:08:43,498
The pond was clogged when we first came.

688
01:08:43,581 --> 01:08:44,833
Really?

689
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:51,965
Do you see that flower?

690
01:08:53,091 --> 01:08:56,094
That's a cornflower. There's a robin's nest.

691
01:08:57,595 --> 01:08:59,597
That's where I found the Empress of India.

692
01:08:59,681 --> 01:09:02,183
I planted all those bulbs and seeds.

693
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,453
I'm going to come here tomorrow.

694
01:09:23,288 --> 01:09:25,040
And the day after.

695
01:09:25,999 --> 01:09:27,959
And the day after that.

696
01:09:31,588 --> 01:09:32,714
See.

697
01:09:32,964 --> 01:09:35,175
You must pull the weeds up...

698
01:09:35,383 --> 01:09:37,469
...to give the flowers room.

699
01:09:37,969 --> 01:09:39,262
Get off.

700
01:09:41,389 --> 01:09:42,974
It's only a worm.

701
01:09:48,521 --> 01:09:50,023
It's not '"ew.'"

702
01:09:57,989 --> 01:09:59,866
See? He likes them, too.

703
01:10:13,421 --> 01:10:14,673
Who's that man?

704
01:10:14,798 --> 01:10:16,675
What are you doing in here?

705
01:10:16,758 --> 01:10:19,886
How did you get in?
You awful, little busybody!

706
01:10:20,178 --> 01:10:23,098
I couldn't bear you the first time
I set eyes on you.

707
01:10:23,181 --> 01:10:25,809
It was the robin who showed me the door.

708
01:10:32,357 --> 01:10:34,150
Do you know who I am?

709
01:10:34,275 --> 01:10:35,735
Who you are?

710
01:10:37,445 --> 01:10:38,822
You're the little cripple.

711
01:10:38,905 --> 01:10:40,615
-If he's got a lump...
-I'm not a cripple!

712
01:10:40,699 --> 01:10:42,492
...it's the size of a pin.

713
01:10:42,867 --> 01:10:44,911
-Your back's not crooked?
-No!

714
01:10:46,162 --> 01:10:48,081
And you haven't crooked legs?

715
01:10:48,873 --> 01:10:51,042
Who said I had crooked legs?

716
01:10:51,876 --> 01:10:53,712
No one ever said that.

717
01:11:18,111 --> 01:11:19,571
You can do it.

718
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:22,240
You can do it.

719
01:11:22,574 --> 01:11:24,075
You can do it.

720
01:11:31,124 --> 01:11:32,334
Look at me.

721
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,085
Just look, you.

722
01:11:45,096 --> 01:11:47,682
We didn't want you, but now you're here.

723
01:11:49,142 --> 01:11:51,394
Don't say a word about it to anyone.

724
01:11:52,437 --> 01:11:54,230
Send for you to help us sometimes.

725
01:11:54,314 --> 01:11:56,941
I've come here before,
when no one saw me.

726
01:11:57,317 --> 01:11:58,777
Your mother...

727
01:11:59,110 --> 01:12:01,196
...was so fond of this garden.

728
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:03,948
She would ask me to look after her roses.

729
01:12:04,783 --> 01:12:06,743
She'd never ask anybody else.

730
01:12:07,577 --> 01:12:10,955
When she went away,
orders were no one were to come here.

731
01:12:11,456 --> 01:12:12,916
But I come anyway.

732
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:14,959
She gave her orders first.

733
01:12:16,169 --> 01:12:18,505
You know how to keep a secret.

734
01:12:19,130 --> 01:12:20,924
Come inside. Be quick.

735
01:12:21,091 --> 01:12:22,509
Oh, laddie.

736
01:12:23,051 --> 01:12:25,136
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

737
01:12:25,261 --> 01:12:27,305
I'll meet him at the door.

738
01:12:31,142 --> 01:12:33,186
-Are you making this magic?
-No.

739
01:12:34,145 --> 01:12:35,105
You are.

740
01:12:35,188 --> 01:12:38,066
It's like the story,
the whole universe is in here.

741
01:12:38,149 --> 01:12:39,859
I'm certain it is.

742
01:12:40,151 --> 01:12:42,153
-I could marry you.
-What?

743
01:12:42,987 --> 01:12:44,489
But we're cousins!

744
01:12:45,115 --> 01:12:46,533
I don't care.

745
01:12:47,117 --> 01:12:48,952
I want us always to be together.

746
01:12:49,035 --> 01:12:50,662
We are together.

747
01:13:00,255 --> 01:13:01,506
Come back.

748
01:13:09,639 --> 01:13:10,932
See you tomorrow.

749
01:13:11,016 --> 01:13:12,684
I'll be back tomorrow.

750
01:13:24,904 --> 01:13:26,531
What's he doing?

751
01:13:28,199 --> 01:13:29,701
What does he want?

752
01:13:31,619 --> 01:13:33,413
He lost his mother.

753
01:13:33,621 --> 01:13:35,081
He's hungry.

754
01:13:36,249 --> 01:13:38,209
He's only a few days old.

755
01:13:38,335 --> 01:13:40,420
He just learned how to walk.

756
01:13:42,714 --> 01:13:44,924
You can hold him, if you like.

757
01:13:47,635 --> 01:13:49,346
Be careful, Master Colin.

758
01:13:50,638 --> 01:13:52,015
Where did he come from?

759
01:13:52,098 --> 01:13:53,600
Three days ago...

760
01:13:54,559 --> 01:13:56,436
...I was out on the moor.

761
01:13:56,978 --> 01:13:59,397
I heard bleating under the bushes.

762
01:13:59,564 --> 01:14:02,067
So, I started to look, and I looked...

763
01:14:02,275 --> 01:14:05,779
...and I looked, and at last,
I seen a bit of gray by a rock.

764
01:14:06,905 --> 01:14:09,616
So, I climbed up
and there was the little one.

765
01:14:13,912 --> 01:14:15,080
Off you go.

766
01:14:16,414 --> 01:14:17,749
Go on. Go on.

767
01:14:24,964 --> 01:14:26,633
Give me your hand.

768
01:14:37,227 --> 01:14:38,478
You can do it.

769
01:14:42,982 --> 01:14:44,275
You can do it.

770
01:14:45,735 --> 01:14:47,153
You can do it.

771
01:14:48,154 --> 01:14:49,614
You can do it.

772
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:10,677
You did it! You can walk!

773
01:15:10,802 --> 01:15:12,637
I did it! I did it!

774
01:15:13,054 --> 01:15:14,347
I did it!

775
01:15:20,854 --> 01:15:22,147
I did it!

776
01:15:39,039 --> 01:15:40,665
Are you a ghost?

777
01:15:40,832 --> 01:15:42,000
It's me!

778
01:15:45,128 --> 01:15:46,796
Medlock might hear you.

779
01:15:46,963 --> 01:15:49,382
Then we wouldn't have to worry
about her anymore.

780
01:15:49,466 --> 01:15:52,302
She'd drop dead
at the sight of you walking.

781
01:15:56,139 --> 01:15:57,682
How did you get here?

782
01:15:57,891 --> 01:15:59,684
I found the way by myself.

783
01:16:01,186 --> 01:16:02,896
You climbed the stairs?

784
01:16:04,189 --> 01:16:06,775
This is how I want it to be with my father.

785
01:16:07,442 --> 01:16:09,027
I want to surprise him.

786
01:16:09,110 --> 01:16:10,570
Just like this.

787
01:16:10,737 --> 01:16:13,365
I want him to see me
before anyone else does.

788
01:16:13,656 --> 01:16:15,575
I wish we knew how to find him.

789
01:16:15,658 --> 01:16:17,118
Medlock must know.

790
01:16:17,285 --> 01:16:19,454
We can steal the address from her.

791
01:16:20,622 --> 01:16:23,249
I'll have a fit,
and when she comes running--

792
01:16:23,541 --> 01:16:25,752
I saw a desk in your father's room.

793
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:29,506
It had lots of papers on it.
Maybe it's there.

794
01:16:55,031 --> 01:16:57,575
I looked and I couldn't find the address.

795
01:16:57,659 --> 01:17:00,412
But I discovered another
of my uncle's secrets.

796
01:17:16,261 --> 01:17:17,637
That's my mother.

797
01:17:27,147 --> 01:17:29,274
I think that is my father.

798
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:35,613
That's me.

799
01:17:52,672 --> 01:17:54,507
I think she's beautiful.

800
01:18:58,446 --> 01:18:59,823
Attention!

801
01:19:02,867 --> 01:19:04,202
Over here.

802
01:19:05,286 --> 01:19:06,454
Smile.

803
01:19:11,251 --> 01:19:12,961
Sit on the swing, Dickon.

804
01:19:14,838 --> 01:19:16,256
Look at each other.

805
01:19:16,339 --> 01:19:17,757
Now, look at me.

806
01:19:44,242 --> 01:19:45,618
Come on, Dickon!

807
01:19:55,337 --> 01:19:56,796
Stop all this.

808
01:19:56,921 --> 01:19:58,131
I am well.

809
01:19:59,049 --> 01:20:01,676
Write to my father
and tell him to come back.

810
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:04,095
I do not believe you are well.

811
01:20:07,724 --> 01:20:09,684
Your pulse is much too quick.

812
01:20:10,352 --> 01:20:13,313
And there's a definite sign
of fever in your eyes.

813
01:20:13,438 --> 01:20:15,190
John, bring that ice.

814
01:20:16,274 --> 01:20:19,903
Despite what you and your cousin
may think, you're still under my care.

815
01:20:19,986 --> 01:20:24,449
Your father trusts me to do what is best
for you, and that's what I will do.

816
01:20:26,993 --> 01:20:30,121
God, look at your legs.
They're all swollen and red.

817
01:20:30,455 --> 01:20:31,790
Come on, Will.

818
01:20:48,723 --> 01:20:51,434
If I'm so sick,
you should send for my father.

819
01:20:51,685 --> 01:20:55,271
You are to stay in bed.
You are not to go out into the gardens.

820
01:20:56,189 --> 01:20:58,775
Give me the address and I'll write to him.

821
01:20:59,109 --> 01:21:00,777
You'll do no such thing.

822
01:21:01,277 --> 01:21:02,487
Give it to me.

823
01:21:02,570 --> 01:21:04,114
I've had enough.

824
01:21:04,447 --> 01:21:07,367
Between the wretched girl
and the dangers of the fresh air...

825
01:21:07,450 --> 01:21:09,911
...heaven knows what's happened to you.

826
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:11,830
You could be clotting.

827
01:21:12,872 --> 01:21:15,125
She probably turned your chair over.

828
01:21:16,292 --> 01:21:18,461
I won't stand for it. Not anymore.

829
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:21,339
I won't stand for any of it! Come on, John.

830
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:35,311
I'm keeping you children apart.

831
01:21:35,395 --> 01:21:37,480
He is a very ill little boy.

832
01:21:37,731 --> 01:21:40,608
I've worked too hard and too long
to keep him alive...

833
01:21:40,692 --> 01:21:45,238
...to have him killed by one pig-headed,
meddlesome little girl like you.

834
01:22:07,802 --> 01:22:08,845
Come on.

835
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:17,937
It's safe.

836
01:22:18,271 --> 01:22:19,647
Everybody's gone.

837
01:22:21,149 --> 01:22:22,901
Ben's waiting at the gate.

838
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:46,383
Thank you.

839
01:22:47,092 --> 01:22:49,094
We're making magic here.

840
01:22:49,427 --> 01:22:52,055
When I grow up,
I'll make great discoveries.

841
01:22:52,222 --> 01:22:54,599
And this is my first experiment.

842
01:22:54,891 --> 01:22:55,934
Aye.

843
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:30,969
'"Oh, great magic

844
01:23:31,594 --> 01:23:33,346
'"Please come to me

845
01:23:33,763 --> 01:23:35,765
'"Send me my father here

846
01:23:35,974 --> 01:23:37,809
'"Set his spirit free

847
01:23:37,976 --> 01:23:39,644
'"Oh, great magic

'"Set his spirit free'"

859
01:24:03,293 --> 01:24:04,377
Go!

860
01:24:58,556 --> 01:25:00,100
Where are you?

861
01:25:01,226 --> 01:25:03,770
In the garden! I'm in the garden!

862
01:25:05,355 --> 01:25:07,107
I'm in the garden!

863
01:25:10,527 --> 01:25:12,362
I'm in the garden...

864
01:25:14,030 --> 01:25:15,573
...with Colin!

865
01:25:37,429 --> 01:25:38,596
I must go.

866
01:25:40,265 --> 01:25:42,308
I must go! Immediately!

867
01:25:42,726 --> 01:25:44,936
I must go tonight. Prepare my bill.

868
01:26:42,660 --> 01:26:44,913
His Lordship's just arrived!

869
01:26:45,789 --> 01:26:46,998
His Lordship?

870
01:26:47,082 --> 01:26:48,833
Where? Where is he?

871
01:26:48,958 --> 01:26:50,168
Outside.

872
01:26:50,502 --> 01:26:52,212
Get me out of this thing.

873
01:26:52,629 --> 01:26:54,464
Will you get me out?

874
01:26:55,298 --> 01:26:57,008
Get me out of it!

875
01:26:57,175 --> 01:26:58,635
Oh, come on!

876
01:27:02,555 --> 01:27:05,183
You're home, sir.
We weren't expecting you.

877
01:27:05,725 --> 01:27:07,519
Here I am. Where's my son?

878
01:27:07,852 --> 01:27:10,689
He's in his room, of course, Your Lordship.

879
01:27:11,856 --> 01:27:14,818
Would you get back to the kitchen,
impudent girl!

880
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:32,085
Where's my son?

881
01:27:34,546 --> 01:27:36,339
He's here, my lord.

882
01:27:37,215 --> 01:27:38,717
He must be here.

883
01:27:47,684 --> 01:27:49,019
What's happened?

884
01:27:52,063 --> 01:27:53,857
It's that child, my lord.

885
01:27:54,357 --> 01:27:56,568
She's created absolute havoc here.

886
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:59,362
I've tried to control her.

887
01:27:59,904 --> 01:28:01,906
She must be sent away, my lord.

888
01:28:02,198 --> 01:28:04,075
She'll kill Master Colin...

889
01:28:04,534 --> 01:28:05,702
...for sure.

890
01:28:06,202 --> 01:28:07,704
Take me to her room.

891
01:28:08,413 --> 01:28:12,917
She has no regard for his fragile state
of health. She does what she pleases.

892
01:28:21,593 --> 01:28:23,094
You lock her in?

893
01:28:23,261 --> 01:28:24,888
I've had to, my lord.

894
01:28:25,055 --> 01:28:26,765
That's how wild she is.

895
01:28:29,934 --> 01:28:31,102
Mary?

896
01:28:33,563 --> 01:28:35,106
Your uncle's here.

897
01:28:47,619 --> 01:28:49,454
I beg your pardon, my lord.

898
01:28:53,667 --> 01:28:55,752
Perhaps they're in the garden.

899
01:28:57,087 --> 01:28:58,254
The garden?

900
01:28:59,464 --> 01:29:01,132
How can they be?

901
01:29:02,133 --> 01:29:03,968
It's quite impossible.

902
01:29:14,771 --> 01:29:16,648
I've done my best, sir.

903
01:29:17,565 --> 01:29:18,942
I really have.

904
01:29:19,442 --> 01:29:21,778
But with that child defying me--

905
01:29:22,112 --> 01:29:23,655
Silence, Medlock!

906
01:29:24,656 --> 01:29:26,449
She's just a child.

907
01:29:27,158 --> 01:29:29,035
I left you in charge.

908
01:29:31,287 --> 01:29:32,831
I'll resign, sir.

909
01:29:36,001 --> 01:29:37,627
I'll leave today.

910
01:29:47,804 --> 01:29:48,972
Don't!

911
01:30:12,704 --> 01:30:16,875
Around and around and around we go,
and where we stop, nobody knows.

912
01:30:21,379 --> 01:30:22,672
Catch me!

913
01:30:22,881 --> 01:30:24,341
Come get me!

914
01:30:25,842 --> 01:30:27,052
Where are you?

915
01:32:40,852 --> 01:32:42,354
I can't believe it.

916
01:32:46,358 --> 01:32:47,525
You're here.

917
01:32:48,151 --> 01:32:49,527
The magic worked.

918
01:33:14,469 --> 01:33:15,720
The garden.

919
01:33:16,012 --> 01:33:17,389
Let me show you.

920
01:33:19,057 --> 01:33:22,394
Mary found the key,
she opened the door and went inside....

921
01:33:26,481 --> 01:33:27,899
No one wants me!

922
01:33:37,367 --> 01:33:39,703
This is where the robin has his nest.

923
01:33:40,078 --> 01:33:41,579
See the babies?

924
01:33:43,206 --> 01:33:44,874
They'll be flying soon.

925
01:33:45,375 --> 01:33:46,960
This is where I walked first.

926
01:33:47,043 --> 01:33:49,087
I was like a baby myself.

927
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:04,621
Why are you here by yourself?

928
01:35:07,332 --> 01:35:08,958
It wasn't wanted.

929
01:35:12,962 --> 01:35:14,673
What wasn't wanted?

930
01:35:17,509 --> 01:35:18,927
The garden.

931
01:35:22,347 --> 01:35:23,556
You're right.

932
01:35:27,769 --> 01:35:29,771
I never wanted to see it again.

933
01:35:30,146 --> 01:35:32,190
You never wanted to see Colin.

934
01:35:37,696 --> 01:35:39,864
You brought us back to life, Mary.

935
01:35:42,409 --> 01:35:45,036
You did something
I thought no one could do.

936
01:35:50,166 --> 01:35:51,710
Don't be afraid.

937
01:35:54,170 --> 01:35:56,047
I won't shut it up again.

938
01:35:56,715 --> 01:35:57,882
Believe me.

939
01:36:11,730 --> 01:36:12,897
Thank you.

940
01:36:21,906 --> 01:36:23,533
Should we call Colin?

941
01:37:00,278 --> 01:37:01,446
What's happening?

942
01:37:01,529 --> 01:37:03,114
Did you see them?

943
01:37:04,699 --> 01:37:06,034
Oh, look!

944
01:37:22,258 --> 01:37:23,760
Master Colin.

945
01:37:24,761 --> 01:37:26,137
Master Colin.

946
01:37:27,597 --> 01:37:28,848
He's walking.

947
01:37:57,002 --> 01:37:58,670
The spell was broken.

948
01:37:58,837 --> 01:38:01,673
My uncle learned to laugh,
and I learned to cry.

949
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:04,676
The secret garden is always open now.

950
01:38:05,218 --> 01:38:06,386
Open...

951
01:38:06,469 --> 01:38:08,471
...and awake and alive.

952
01:38:09,931 --> 01:38:11,850
Ifyou look the right way...

953
01:38:11,933 --> 01:38:14,769
...you can see
that the whole world is a garden.

954
