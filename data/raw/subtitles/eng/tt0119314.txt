1
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,617
That shit!

2
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:31,127
- Hello!
- Hello!

3
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,514
- So, did you ask 'em?
- Yep. They said fine.

4
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,516
Oh, good!

5
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,601
Sure it's okay with your mom,
though, right?

6
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,853
Yeah, she doesn't care.
She's working.

7
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,855
Isn't she coming up this weekend?

8
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,191
I don't know.

9
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,194
So, ah, come on, how cute is he?
Spit it out.

10
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,613
- Oh, he's kind of gorgeous.
- Yeah?

11
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:03,076
He's sort of like a cousin, but not
really. He wants to be a forest ranger.

12
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:07,706
Oh, good! Well, then after dinner
we could set a fire in your room,
and he can come and rescue us.

13
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,500
You should've seen the look
on her face.

14
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,962
I never laughed so hard, I swear to God.
I just can't believe you might miss it.

15
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,672
Oh.

16
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,966
Hi, Gulliver.
How you doin', boy?

17
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,095
Hey, Pilgrim.

18
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,599
Come here.

19
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:41,781
Hey, babe.
You're such a beautiful boy.

20
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:45,452
What are you thinkin', huh?
What are you thinkin', boy?

21
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,624
You wanna go for a ride?

22
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:58,423
Let's go for a ride.
Come on. Come on, boy. Come on.

23
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,053
- Hello?
- It's me.

24
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:48,181
<i>- Hi.
- Hi.</i>

25
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,854
- So what train are you taking?
- Um, I should be in by 2:00.

26
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:59,275
<i>Okay.
You want me to pick you up?</i>

27
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,277
No, I can take a cab.
Grace go riding?

28
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,864
Mm-hmm. What do you want to do
about dinner?

29
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:08,118
<i>- I hadn't thought.
- I can ask to try that place
Emily says--</i>

30
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,705
- Oh, hang on.
- They're here, so--

31
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,626
I, I'll let you go. We'll figure it out
when you get here, okay?

32
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,880
Yeah, okay. Okay. Bye.
Hello?

33
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,051
Please! Oh, God, please!

34
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:28,013
Oh, wait. Have you seen that
stupid cereal commercial? It's like--

35
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,725
-And where are the paintings? It's about
her work, and we can't even see it.
-But we're trying to--

36
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,394
We can change the colour of the deck,
and we can move it up so then
you can see the paintings--

37
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,397
We need to see the paintings.
She's an artist.

38
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,107
- Have you checked on her going rate?
- Gottschalk.

39
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,152
Yes. The legal department's
on that right now.

40
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,362
<i>- David!
- Did you speak to Felton?</i>

41
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,740
Yes, we're suing.

42
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:50,243
<i>Well, is that absolutely necessary?
It'll just make it a bigger story.</i>

43
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:54,205
<i>-Am I on the speaker?
- David, he signed an agreement
that he wouldn't talk to the press...</i>

44
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:57,292
and now he's libelled me
by saying I faked the figures.

45
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:01,171
<i>- You're not going soft on me, are you?
- Well, nothing like a good public feud.</i>

46
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,922
Exactly!

47
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,718
- You know that kid Adam?
- Yeah.

48
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:10,555
- Mm-mmm, he's very cute!
- I, I think you'd make a good couple,
Grace.

49
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,307
- I don't think so.
- Oh, I do!

50
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,434
- You think he's cute?
- Eww! Are you serious?

51
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,604
- I think he's cute.
- Oh, I think he's lucky
that he lives next door to you.

52
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,856
- I think, I think I--
- What do you think?

53
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,900
I think you have a crush on him.

54
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,696
All right, let's take a shortcut.
Let's take a shortcut.

55
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,407
- You know, we can't even read it.
- Friday is confirmed.
- Right, okay.

56
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,827
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We have to reshoot this.

57
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,121
<i>- I said it
- I said that
- I said it</i>

58
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,581
<i>- It's ''that.'' It's ''that.''
- I said it</i>

59
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:40,335
- I swear to God, it's ''that.''
- It, it, it, it!
- It's ''that.''

60
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,212
- All right, fine.
Let's start again. Ready?
- All right, fine, fine, fine.

61
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,799
<i>All right.
I met him at a party</i>

62
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:49,636
<i>And he told me how to drive</i>

63
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,722
<i>He said he'd like to do it backwards</i>

64
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,808
<i>I said it
It</i>

65
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,227
- Come on.
-Judith.

66
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:00,105
<i>I said it
It!</i>

67
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,358
Come on!

68
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,487
Gulliver. Gulliver, up!
Up, Gulliver! Whoa!

69
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,906
-Judith!
- Hey! No! No, no, no!

70
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,325
Grace, look out!

71
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:16,496
- Pilgrim!Judith,Judith!
- Grace!

72
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,342
Hello!

73
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,613
No!

74
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,160
Gulliver!

75
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:59,456
Gulliver, stop!
Hold it, Gulliver!

76
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:06,004
Gulliver! Come on!

77
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,183
Robert.

78
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,064
Judith's dead.

79
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,651
And what about Grace?

80
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,737
- She's in pretty bad shape.
- It's a multiple trauma.

81
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:15,824
- Where is she?
- She's still in the O.R.

82
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:19,744
- O.R.? What for?
- I-It's just-- It's--

83
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:24,374
It's a mid-shaft, tib-fib fracture
with a vascular compromise, meaning
the blood supply to the lower leg--

84
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,585
They think they have to take part
of the leg off.

85
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,136
Which leg?

86
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,557
T-The right leg.

87
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,209
Oh,Jesus.

88
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,006
Okay.

89
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,307
Just take it easy.

90
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,227
This is gonna be tough on both of us.

91
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:29,022
So let's not make it any harder
than it has to be.

92
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,945
Judith.

93
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:29,416
- That bag's almost empty.
- Oh, they'll be in to change it.

94
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:33,420
If you leave it up to these people--
Excuse me.

95
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:36,381
- My daughter needs a new I.V.
- Yes, I know. We have her down.

96
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,134
Well, I'd like it
taken care of now, please.

97
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,553
You have to stay on top
of these people constantly.

98
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,766
I'm sorry.

99
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,312
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

100
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,235
We really should let her get some rest,
and I do have to change the bandage.

101
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:01,489
You can come back in a couple of hours
and see how she's doing.

102
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:28,475
Mrs MacLean? Mrs MacLean,
you have a call on line two.
You can take it right there.

103
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:34,397
- Hello?
- Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?

104
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,027
Her leg was very damaged,
and they had to remove it.

105
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,198
Oh, God. Annie, I'm so sorry.

106
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,950
Listen, I, I know
that you're being hit with a lot now...

107
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:51,039
and it's hard to think
about anything else,
but I have to talk to you about Pilgrim.

108
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,459
<i>Hello?</i>

109
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,462
Yeah, I'm here.

110
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,799
<i>I've never seen an animal
with these injuries still breathing.</i>

111
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:03,510
I'd like your permission
to put him down.

112
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:08,973
<i>- It's, it's really the best thing--
- Uh, I-- Y-- Uh--
You mean shoot him?</i>

113
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:12,769
<i>-Annie.
- Well, um--</i>

114
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,690
Um, look, Liz.
The doctor's here right now...

115
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,275
and I, I can't make this decision
on my own.

116
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:22,112
<i>-Annie, I understand that,
but I have to know--
- Uh, just do what you can.</i>

117
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,906
<i>- Okay?
- Annie, no matter what I do,
this horse will never be the same.</i>

118
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:28,201
Well, look, I, I, I, I just don't know.
It's Grace's horse, so when she--

119
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:32,872
- It's not right to make it suffer.
- I cannot deal with this now, Liz.

120
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:36,209
I-If you need a yes or a no,
then don't do it.

121
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:41,631
Okay? Just, just, just, j-just do
what you can for him, okay?

122
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,383
Right.

123
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:48,138
Animal should be put down.
Anybody can see that.

124
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,474
What did he say?

125
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:54,144
Nothing.
He's just going off duty.

126
00:14:55,895 --> 00:15:00,400
Well! That's important information, huh?

127
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,318
Christ.

128
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,612
Doctors, huh?

129
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,496
I'm gonna get to know all
the nurses' names.

130
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:22,505
It's, it's good to know their names.

131
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,479
- I'll go get some of her things.
- I'll go.

132
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,692
No! I'll go.
You stay, in case she wakes up.

133
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,769
You guys go on ahead.
I'll be up by Christmas.

134
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:06,067
Oh, I meant to tell you. I got
those tickets for the Knicks game.

135
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,652
Good.

136
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:10,989
- Wanna come, Annie?
- No. Why don't you go with a friend,
Grace?

137
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,991
Yeah.

138
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:18,997
Wanna eat something else, honey?
We can order out something else.

139
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,958
No, I'm just not that hungry.
That's all.

140
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,044
Well, you should try to eat anyway.
It's the only way you're gonna--

141
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,921
I said I wasn't hungry.

142
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:30,759
- Wanna watch some television?
- I think she should finish first.
- Maybe.

143
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:36,014
I just-- I-- I can't.

144
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:39,309
- Here.
- I'm sorry.

145
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:42,312
No, Dad! I got it. Got it.

146
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:44,689
Sorry.

147
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:58,078
- You've got to stop doing that.
- What?

148
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,874
Helping her all the time.

149
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:07,003
Running to her every time she trips,
anticipating her.

150
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:11,216
You know, Annie,
this didn't just happen to you.

151
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:33,071
Hi, Grace.

152
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,420
I don't care what he told you.
The man's a liar.

153
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,798
He's a actor, for God's sake.

154
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,092
He'd do anything to get a cover.

155
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:23,830
Gracie, what happened?

156
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:28,460
It doesn't matter.
I just--

157
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:31,296
I don't wanna come back.
That's all.

158
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,800
Well, what are you gonna do? I mean,
you have to go to school, sweetheart.

159
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:38,011
I said no!

160
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:41,931
I don't want to come back.
That's it. I wanna go home.

161
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:47,354
Grace, listen to me. Hmm?

162
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:50,857
Your leg is just healing, and you have
to give the rest of you time as well.

163
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:56,029
Is that your version of a pep talk?

164
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:01,368
Well, you're not staying home all day,
feeling sorry for yourself.

165
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,995
You're gonna get up,
and you're gonna figure this out.

166
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,997
Fine.

167
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:09,626
It's still early.
What's your next class?

168
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:13,588
Gym.

169
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:33,316
<i>Appears to be an excellent jump.
Head and hands, eyes, perfect.</i>

170
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:37,445
<i>Pilgrim moves with absolute confidence
at the command of Miss MacLean.</i>

171
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:19,195
- What is it, sweetheart?
- I wanna see Pilgrim.

172
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:47,640
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Hi.

173
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:53,563
It's so good to see you.
How are you doing?

174
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:55,815
- She's doing just great.
Aren't you, kiddo?
- I'm fine.

175
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:59,110
Watch your step.

176
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:02,322
Mind how you go.
It's muddy back there.

177
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:04,199
Back there?

178
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:08,995
W-Well, what do you, what do you mean?
Why isn't he in the barn
with the other horses?

179
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,545
Well, Grace, you see...

180
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:22,050
Pilgrim just isn't the same horse
that he used to be.

181
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:25,303
As a matter of fact, maybe now's
not the best time for you to see him.

182
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:29,307
I really wanna see him.

183
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:54,666
Can you open it, please?

184
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,846
Hey!

185
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:11,224
Hello, beautiful boy.

186
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:21,026
- No! No!
- Grace.
- Oh, God, no, no, please.

187
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:24,988
- No, Grace.
- No, no, no, no. Leave me alone!

188
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,950
Here. Grace. Grace!

189
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:32,370
Mr MacLean, I'm so sorry.

190
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,710
- Dad, why didn't you tell me?
- I'm so sorry.

191
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:50,722
You should've told her, Annie.
This animal is beyond help.

192
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:56,811
Annie, can I have your permission now
to put him down?

193
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,067
No.

194
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:07,655
And get me every publication on riding,
racing, breeding.

195
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:10,742
Everything.
Medical publications as well.

196
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:13,578
Veterinarian journals. And tell them
it's me, and I want it now.

197
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,248
- Hold on, hold on. Gottschalk.
- I'll call him back.

198
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,542
- He says he's on his way
to the airport, he really needs--
- Lucy, I'll call him back.

199
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:22,170
I'll call him back.
Just get me what I want.

200
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:01,960
''A million years before man...

201
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:04,879
''they grazed the vast
and empty plains...

202
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:06,881
''living by voices
only they could hear.

203
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:13,680
''They first came to know man
as the hunted knows the hunter...

204
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:23,148
''for long before he used horses
for his labours...

205
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:27,986
''he killed them for meat.

206
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:32,866
''The alliance with man
would forever be fragile...

207
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:39,372
''for the fear he'd struck
into their hearts...

208
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:41,833
''was too deep to be dislodged.

209
00:25:43,835 --> 00:25:46,171
''Since that Neolithic moment...

210
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:49,924
''when a horse was first haltered...

211
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:53,720
''there were those among men
who understood this.

212
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:58,933
''They could see
into the creature's soul...

213
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:01,478
''and soothe the wounds
they found there.

214
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:09,110
''The secrets uttered softly
into troubled ears.

215
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:15,867
These men were known
as the Whisperers.''

216
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,000
It's perfectly shot,
perfectly cropped...

217
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:26,336
perfectly laid out,
and I am so bloody bored.

218
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:28,630
Start again.

219
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:32,550
Thank you.
Would you excuse me for a moment?

220
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:34,552
Yes.

221
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:41,726
- Hello?
- Yeah, this is Tom Booker.
I got a message you called.

222
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:45,980
<i>Oh, hello, Mr Booker.
It's Annie MacLean from Cover.</i>

223
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:48,066
You know, the magazine.

224
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:52,404
Um, well, thank you
for returning my call.

225
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:55,115
<i>- Is there something
I can do for you, ma'am?
- Yes, yes.</i>

226
00:26:55,198 --> 00:26:59,160
I read this article about what you do
for people with horse problems.

227
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:02,664
Well, truth is, I help horses
with people problems.

228
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:04,791
Well, whichever way
you want to put it.

229
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:09,587
Uh, this article said that you were,
you were a, a horse whisperer.

230
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:14,342
Oh, they said that, huh?
A whisperer. Hmm.

231
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:17,429
And I was hoping that you'd come
to New York...

232
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:20,390
and take a look at my daughter's horse
and possibly do some--

233
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:24,227
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but I'm,
I'm afraid you've misunderstood
whatever it is you read.

234
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:26,980
Because that's not exactly what I do.
I mostly conduct clinics, you see, and--

235
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:29,816
Well, could you come to New York
just for the day?

236
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:31,818
<i>- It's only a few hours by plane.
- And I'm not doin' them now.</i>

237
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:34,863
I'm on my way to Montana where I have
a ranch to take care of.

238
00:27:34,946 --> 00:27:37,866
Well, I'd pay your fare, of course.
Uh, first class.

239
00:27:37,949 --> 00:27:40,785
Ma'am, first class to Montana
is a waste of good money.

240
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:44,414
Well, if you could just give me a time
when you'd be available.

241
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:47,792
Say, am I, am I being too polite here
when I say ''no'' in Nevada?

242
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:49,669
<i>Does that mean ''yes'' where you are?</i>

243
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:52,464
<i>Look, I'm really sorry for your
situation, but there's nothing I can do.</i>

244
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:55,884
You just called the wrong person is all.
I'm sure there's some fine horse doctors
back east.

245
00:27:55,967 --> 00:27:57,886
No, but I don't want a horse doctor.

246
00:27:57,969 --> 00:28:01,097
<i>- I want, I want you.
- So I, I hope everything goes okay
with you and your horse.</i>

247
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:03,808
<i>- Well, but you see, it's not my horse.
- So, so, goodbye now.</i>

248
00:28:11,983 --> 00:28:14,319
Grace?

249
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:16,529
Grace, it's Mom.

250
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:26,581
Grace?

251
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:29,834
Grace?

252
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:35,882
Are you all right?

253
00:28:44,182 --> 00:28:47,852
- I've decided about Pilgrim.
- Oh.

254
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:49,938
I think we should put him down.

255
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:54,401
It's not fair to let him suffer.

256
00:28:56,444 --> 00:29:00,240
- Well, I think that's a very--
- Maybe they should put me down, too.

257
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:05,120
- What?
- I'm not much use anymore.

258
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:10,208
You're getting a fax.

259
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:32,731
- You're up late.
- Is it?

260
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:34,482
- How was the dinner?
- Is Grace asleep?

261
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:36,484
- Yeah, I think so.
- Nothing we haven't heard before.

262
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:39,571
Just louder this time. That's all.

263
00:29:41,031 --> 00:29:44,951
- So why'd you go?
- Well, one of us had to.

264
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:47,579
They're still our friends, Annie.

265
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:59,007
Listen, I had a thought.
What do you think
we go someplace warm, the three of us?

266
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:03,470
Bermuda or the Bahamas or--
What?

267
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:08,850
Mmm, nothing.

268
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:11,102
No, I just don't know if Bermuda
would be such a good idea.

269
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:15,940
- Grace would have to wear
summer dresses or shorts.
- Oh, yeah, of course, of course.

270
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:23,365
What is it?

271
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,371
I want to take Pilgrim out to see this
horse guy. Drive him out to Montana.

272
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:34,584
- No, I'm serious.
- Now, wait a minute.

273
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:38,963
- I thought you said you didn't like
the way he sounded on the phone.
- Well, I didn't.

274
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:42,133
- I want to take Grace with me.
- You're kidding!

275
00:30:42,175 --> 00:30:44,427
Liz'll find me a trailer.
We can stay at motels along the way.

276
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:46,680
- What, you made arrangements already?
- No, I just checked out a few things.
You know.

277
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:50,850
- Wait a minute. Drive a crazed horse
all the way to Montana with--
- Oh, he's not crazed, Robert.

278
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:53,353
- Don't exaggerate.
- No, I can't just pack up and leave.

279
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:56,231
- Well, I'm not asking you to.
I'll do it.
- By yourself? How?

280
00:30:56,314 --> 00:30:59,275
- You can't take care of Pilgrim.
- He'll be sedated.

281
00:30:59,317 --> 00:31:01,528
- I do know a thing or two about horses.
- What about the magazine?

282
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:03,822
I'm in charge.
I can oversee things from Montana.

283
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:05,824
- I can take my fax, my computer.
- Oh, you're in charge.

284
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:08,326
Well, what about Grace? The doctor says
she needs stability and security.

285
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,870
Well, I can't say he's being
all that effective with her.

286
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:15,166
- Are you a psychiatrist?
He says it takes time.
- Well, I don't care what he says!

287
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,502
I cannot sit here and pretend
everything's gonna be all right.

288
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:19,629
- I am not pretending. I am trusting.
- We have to do something, Robert.

289
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:24,175
- Other people know more
about this than we do.
- We are losing-- We are losing her!

290
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:28,138
I don't care what the doctors say.
They don't know her.

291
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:32,434
I don't care
if this doesn't sound rational.
Nobody is suggesting anything better!

292
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:37,022
I, I can't explain it, Robert.
I just have this feeling.

293
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:39,524
I just know it's the right thing.

294
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:42,527
Why, Annie?

295
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:51,536
I just know it.

296
00:31:56,541 --> 00:32:00,253
Does this, uh, cowboy vet
know that you're coming?

297
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:03,381
Yeah.

298
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,181
What if Grace doesn't wanna go?

299
00:32:11,222 --> 00:32:13,308
She will if you think she should.

300
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:20,940
- And you think it's best
if I don't come.
- No, that's not what I said.

301
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:23,151
Daddy?

302
00:32:24,986 --> 00:32:27,739
I don't wanna go.

303
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:31,659
Straight back. Come on.
A little closer. A little more.

304
00:32:32,577 --> 00:32:35,413
Watch it. Get behind him.

305
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:39,292
Hold it! Get back! Hold it.

306
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:41,294
- Watch it!
- There he goes, Eddie!

307
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:45,090
- Why don't you get inside and--
- Lady, we're doing the best we can!

308
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:51,012
- It's the only way to load
this kind of horse.
- Keep trying.

309
00:32:51,096 --> 00:32:54,474
- Maybe we should give him
another sedative.
- We did.

310
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:57,310
Get the gate! Get the gate!

311
00:32:57,394 --> 00:33:00,271
Let's get out of here!
Hold that door!

312
00:33:06,695 --> 00:33:09,447
You got a gun, just in case?

313
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:11,449
Of course not.

314
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:13,618
That's probably best.

315
00:33:13,702 --> 00:33:17,122
You may want to shoot yourself
halfway to Ohio.

316
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:30,862
Grace, are you hungry?
Do you want to stop for lunch?

317
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:33,073
I don't care.

318
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:39,204
I want to find a place before
it gets dark. What do you think?

319
00:34:40,288 --> 00:34:44,376
- Grace?
- Doesn't matter.

320
00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:46,378
Okay, Lucy, look.
This is what I'll do.

321
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:49,089
I'll get to the next motel,
see if they have a fax and then--

322
00:34:50,382 --> 00:34:53,802
Oh, wait, hang on. Uh--
I gotta go, okay? Later.

323
00:35:00,058 --> 00:35:03,395
Grace, do you want
to put your music on up here?

324
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:10,735
Grace.

325
00:35:10,819 --> 00:35:13,905
Do you want to put your music on
up here?

326
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:22,455
<i>And when you purchase
your Eureka World Deluxe Vac--</i>

327
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:26,459
<i>Here the agricultural markets
and farm news headlines continue to--</i>

328
00:35:26,543 --> 00:35:28,461
<i>Insecticide for small grains.</i>

329
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:30,630
<i>Important to always read
and follow label instructions--</i>

330
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:34,217
<i>This here man was rejuvenated
in the grace of the Lord.</i>

331
00:35:34,259 --> 00:35:36,261
<i>He was washed.</i>

332
00:35:43,852 --> 00:35:47,814
Mmm, Grace, look at this.

333
00:35:49,899 --> 00:35:52,777
Do you wanna see that?

334
00:35:52,861 --> 00:35:56,031
- I don't care.
- ''I don't care.''

335
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:03,955
Oh, it'll be fun. You haven't seen
any of the sights yet. It's history.

336
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:06,791
When I was 1 3, I used to love
doing things like this.

337
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:09,836
Oh, you were never 1 3, Mom.

338
00:36:17,093 --> 00:36:19,054
Oh.

339
00:36:23,516 --> 00:36:25,477
Great idea, Mom. Now what?

340
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:30,899
- How long is this gonna go on?
- What?

341
00:36:32,567 --> 00:36:35,320
You know what I mean.

342
00:36:39,824 --> 00:36:42,410
Do you want us to go back home?
Is that what you want?

343
00:36:42,494 --> 00:36:45,205
What are you asking me for?
You didn't ask me if I wanted to come
in the first place.

344
00:36:45,288 --> 00:36:47,207
Now I get to decide? Sorry.

345
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:52,337
Do you know who I'm doing this for?
I'm doing this for you.

346
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:56,383
Bullshit! It's all about you, about
you deciding, about you being right!

347
00:36:56,466 --> 00:36:58,551
-It's like we work for you or somethin'!
-I don't believe this!

348
00:36:58,635 --> 00:37:01,262
- How come Daddy didn't come, huh?
- What do you mean?

349
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:04,099
You know everything.
You figure it out.

350
00:37:04,182 --> 00:37:07,894
- Your father had to work.
- Yeah, right!

351
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:11,314
- Would you please stop acting like
you know what you're talking about?
- You are amazing, you know?

352
00:37:11,356 --> 00:37:14,359
I mean, you act like I don't even live
in that house anymore.

353
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:17,195
What, you think
I don't know what's going on?
You think I'm still five years old!

354
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:19,614
- When you act like this, you are.
- How long are we gonna be away, huh?

355
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:22,117
- I don't know. I don't know.
- Yeah, well, what if this guy
can't do anything, huh?

356
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,869
I don't know!

357
00:37:26,204 --> 00:37:29,207
I don't have all the answers.

358
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:31,251
No, you just act like you do.

359
00:39:09,808 --> 00:39:14,771
- You okay, ma'am?
- Yeah, I'm, I'm fine.

360
00:39:14,813 --> 00:39:17,399
That young lady's gettin'
a little worried.

361
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:19,567
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

362
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,619
- Good night, ma'am.
- Good night.

363
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,797
You buckled up?

364
00:39:42,632 --> 00:39:45,343
- Are you cold?
- A little.

365
00:39:55,103 --> 00:39:59,941
<i>You may have seen the

<i>Wilson Travel is offering charter

370
00:40:12,203 --> 00:40:14,831
<i>Well, looks like lots of precipitation,

371
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:18,043
<i>Great Falls, an inch and a half.

376
00:40:38,813 --> 00:40:41,399
Gee, this place looks like fun.

377
00:40:46,154 --> 00:40:48,907
- Don't they believe in signs
around here?
- What would they say?

378
00:40:48,948 --> 00:40:53,161
- ''Ten miles to Big Rock,
twenty miles to Bigger Rock''?
- No.

379
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:55,997
- Great trip, Mom.
I'm having so much fun.
- I think I should turn here.

380
00:40:57,415 --> 00:41:01,378
Oh, yeah, those rocks over there,
much more interesting.

381
00:42:24,753 --> 00:42:27,839
Can we take a look at Bronty's foal
when we're done here, Dad?

382
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:29,841
Sure, as long as she don't mind.

383
00:42:29,924 --> 00:42:33,428
There's this kid at school says
we should have imprint-trained him.

384
00:42:33,511 --> 00:42:36,848
Says if you do it soon as they're born,
makes 'em real easy to handle later on.

385
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,975
That's what some folks say.

386
00:42:39,017 --> 00:42:42,520
There's this thing on the TV
about a guy who does it with geese.

387
00:42:42,562 --> 00:42:46,232
He has this aeroplane,
and these baby geese all grow up
thinking it's their mom.

388
00:42:46,316 --> 00:42:50,487
And he flies it, and they just follow.
You hear about that, Uncle T?

389
00:42:50,528 --> 00:42:52,614
Yeah. Heard about it.

390
00:42:52,697 --> 00:42:55,325
Well, what do you think
about all that stuff?

391
00:42:55,367 --> 00:42:59,287
Well, I'll tell ya,Joey,
it might be all right for geese to
grow up thinkin' they're aeroplanes...

392
00:42:59,371 --> 00:43:01,956
but horses, as far as I can tell,
can't fly.

393
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:06,378
We expecting company?

394
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:17,138
- You know who it is?
- Nope.

395
00:43:20,725 --> 00:43:24,479
- Mr Booker?
- Yeah?
- Yeah?

396
00:43:24,562 --> 00:43:26,564
Tom Booker?

397
00:43:43,748 --> 00:43:47,585
Annie MacLean from New York.
We talked on the phone.

398
00:43:47,627 --> 00:43:52,173
I had a little bit of a hard time
finding the place. There are no signs.

399
00:43:52,257 --> 00:43:55,635
Oh, there are plenty of signs,
just not many of them printed.

400
00:43:55,719 --> 00:43:58,972
Why do I get the impression
that you're just not driving through?

401
00:44:01,474 --> 00:44:04,436
I want you to take a look at my horse.
Now, it won't take long.

402
00:44:04,477 --> 00:44:06,938
And if you still feel the same way,
then I'm sure I can find--

403
00:44:07,022 --> 00:44:09,024
You thinkin' about personally
driving me back east?

404
00:44:09,107 --> 00:44:13,111
Oh, no, no, no. No, I brought him along,
and my daughter, too.

405
00:44:13,153 --> 00:44:16,114
We're at, we're at the Lazy J Motel.

406
00:44:16,156 --> 00:44:20,243
- You hauled him all the way out here?
- Well, yeah.

407
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:23,371
I had a trailer. It's not like
I made him run alongside the car.

408
00:44:23,455 --> 00:44:26,291
- By yourself?
- Mm-hmm.

409
00:44:27,917 --> 00:44:30,420
Well, ma'am, I appreciate the pains
that you've obviously gone through--

410
00:44:30,462 --> 00:44:33,631
Look, please don't do
the ''Shucks, ma'am'' thing again.

411
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:37,552
I have just driven a few thousand miles
for a few minutes of your time.

412
00:44:37,635 --> 00:44:39,846
I have brought him
all the way out here.

413
00:44:39,929 --> 00:44:42,599
Just take a look at him.
If you still feel the same way...

414
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,852
I will be on the road by morning, and
you'll never hear from me again, okay?

415
00:44:45,935 --> 00:44:47,687
Deal?

416
00:44:49,647 --> 00:44:52,317
We're at the Lazy J Motel.
Whenever you're free.

417
00:44:54,027 --> 00:44:56,821
You don't have to call.

418
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:01,659
Jesus!

419
00:45:12,837 --> 00:45:15,757
- No, this is what you call the boonies.
- Mom, the door.

420
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,134
No. No, not really.

421
00:45:18,176 --> 00:45:21,763
No services,
and there's one doctor in town.

422
00:45:21,846 --> 00:45:24,349
But I managed to find a therapist
for Grace.

423
00:45:24,432 --> 00:45:26,601
I had to drive, like, two hours.

424
00:45:27,936 --> 00:45:30,939
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Did they get the colour corrections?

425
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,694
- Yeah?
- Uh, I'm Tom Booker.
Is your mother around?

426
00:45:35,735 --> 00:45:38,196
She's on the phone.
She'll be right out.

427
00:45:38,279 --> 00:45:43,493
- Could I--
- Mom, there's a cowboy here.

428
00:45:43,535 --> 00:45:48,498
This is not Gottschalk's business.
Why is he interfering with this?

429
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,583
I told him I'd take care of it.

430
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:54,421
No. I told him I'd take care of it,
and I will take care of it.

431
00:45:54,504 --> 00:45:57,173
I just have to get myself settled here.

432
00:45:57,215 --> 00:46:02,095
Well, um, put it in a memo,
and I'll sign it.

433
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,142
- This your first time in Montana?
- Oh, no! Really?

434
00:46:07,225 --> 00:46:11,021
Uh, it's completely ridiculous.
It's completely ridiculous.

435
00:46:11,062 --> 00:46:13,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. I can imagine.

436
00:46:13,523 --> 00:46:16,109
I can imagine. They are?

437
00:46:16,192 --> 00:46:19,404
<i>Then why did you go to meet him,
alone, secretly?</i>

438
00:46:19,446 --> 00:46:22,365
<i>-All dressed up?
- That's, that's funny.</i>

439
00:46:22,407 --> 00:46:26,244
No, really?
I can't believe that.

440
00:46:26,327 --> 00:46:31,082
- Is she gonna be long?
- Probably. She's on the phone
23 hours a day.

441
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:35,295
- What does she do?
- She's an editor.

442
00:46:35,378 --> 00:46:37,797
An editor? Ah, ah, yeah.

443
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:42,302
Just in case she hasn't told you,
which she probably hasn't...

444
00:46:42,385 --> 00:46:44,471
I don't wanna be a part of this,
okay?

445
00:46:44,554 --> 00:46:47,432
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

446
00:46:49,642 --> 00:46:53,188
Hi. Sorry about that.

447
00:46:53,271 --> 00:46:57,150
Grace, this is Mr Booker.
Did you look at Pilgrim yet?

448
00:46:57,233 --> 00:46:59,277
I was gonna take that look now.

449
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:02,447
Would you like me to come with you?
I have to run over to the office
and give Mr Peterson a cheque.

450
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:04,199
- Doesn't matter.
- Grace?

451
00:47:04,282 --> 00:47:08,495
Do you wanna come with us,
take a look at Pilgrim?

452
00:47:08,578 --> 00:47:11,039
- Probably best she stay behind anyway.
- Okay.

453
00:47:21,591 --> 00:47:23,968
- Howdy, Lester.
- Howdy.

454
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:26,680
- Goin' to see that horse?
- Yeah, I thought I might.

455
00:47:26,763 --> 00:47:31,351
Well, I hope you got insurance.
That dirty son of a bitch.

456
00:49:57,205 --> 00:49:59,708
Well, you're the closest
anyone's ever gotten.

457
00:50:12,971 --> 00:50:14,889
I have to be honest with you.

458
00:50:14,973 --> 00:50:17,809
I still feel you've made
a long trip for nothin'.

459
00:50:25,942 --> 00:50:28,653
But before I even think about it...

460
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:32,866
I need to know somethin' right now.

461
00:50:32,949 --> 00:50:35,243
And it's a question for Grace.

462
00:50:35,326 --> 00:50:38,788
You see, when I work with a horse,
it's no good just me doin' it.

463
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:41,041
- The owner's gotta be involved, too.
- Well, that'll be a little complicated.

464
00:50:41,124 --> 00:50:44,627
You can make it as complicated
or as easy as you like.

465
00:50:44,669 --> 00:50:47,422
But she's the one that's gonna
be ridin' him. Am I right?

466
00:50:49,841 --> 00:50:51,593
Hey? Right?

467
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:55,930
Now, here's the deal.

468
00:50:56,014 --> 00:50:58,600
I don't know that I can do anything.

469
00:50:58,683 --> 00:51:01,061
But I'm prepared to give it a go,
if you'll help.

470
00:51:03,146 --> 00:51:06,358
- Oh, you have a problem with that?
- Isn't it, like, obvious?

471
00:51:07,692 --> 00:51:10,362
Not to me.
Either you want to or you don't.

472
00:51:10,445 --> 00:51:15,033
- Look, I'll talk to--
- Excuse me. With all due respect,
this is her decision, not yours.

473
00:51:16,951 --> 00:51:21,539
Now, I don't wanna waste
anybody's time here, mostly mine.

474
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:26,711
Well, nothin' else to do around here.

475
00:51:29,172 --> 00:51:32,926
That's not good enough.
I can't help you.

476
00:51:36,179 --> 00:51:38,056
What do I have to do?

477
00:51:38,139 --> 00:51:41,559
I said, what do I have to do?

478
00:51:43,603 --> 00:51:46,606
Well, what does she want?

479
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:50,235
- Does she want you to take care
of her horse?
- Somethin' like that.

480
00:51:50,276 --> 00:51:53,405
- And they're stayin' in a motel?
- The Lazy J.
Can I have some butter please?

481
00:51:53,488 --> 00:51:58,993
- Not exactly a tourist stop.
- Well, well, what about the girl?
Doesn't she go to school?

482
00:51:59,077 --> 00:52:03,415
- I don't know.
- You know, I just think she's got
a lot of nerve showin' up here.

483
00:52:03,456 --> 00:52:06,376
Draggin' that, you know, poor animal
and that child all the way--

484
00:52:06,418 --> 00:52:11,089
Honey, don't eat with your fingers.
Frank, don't you think
she's got a lot of nerve?

485
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:14,759
Well, hell, I don't know. According to
Tom, she's a pretty determined woman.

486
00:52:14,801 --> 00:52:16,886
She must've thought it was worth it.

487
00:52:16,928 --> 00:52:21,474
Yeah. Well, I guess they'll want
feedin', bein' out here all day long.

488
00:52:21,558 --> 00:52:25,687
- I don't think they'll expect that.
- What, they gonna drive 40 miles into
town every time they want a hamburger?

489
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:28,940
- Mixed salad.
- What?

490
00:52:29,024 --> 00:52:32,027
Well, I believe women from New York
eat mixed salads.

491
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:34,195
- Ain't that right, Tom?
- I believe so.

492
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:38,783
Well, that's just what we need!
A vegetarian from New York
on our cattle ranch.

493
00:52:40,994 --> 00:52:44,247
<i>A Great Traveller, interested,
not merely a good one...</i>

494
00:52:44,289 --> 00:52:46,458
<i>is a kind of introspective.</i>

495
00:52:46,499 --> 00:52:48,460
<i>As she covers the ground outwardly...</i>

496
00:52:48,501 --> 00:52:52,630
<i>so she advances towards fresh
interpretations of herself, inwardly.</i>

497
00:52:52,714 --> 00:52:55,258
<i>And this is the quality
which lends Frea Starks'books...</i>

498
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:59,346
<i>the memorable poetic density
which is their special cachet.</i>

499
00:52:59,429 --> 00:53:02,640
<i>Moreover, it is this quality
which makes them as fresh and strike--</i>

500
00:54:56,796 --> 00:54:59,257
You're at a good place to quit.

501
00:54:59,341 --> 00:55:01,885
Oh, I got him movin' out a bit.
That's about it.

502
00:55:01,926 --> 00:55:04,804
It's still a long ways away
from gettin' a leg over him.

503
00:55:25,283 --> 00:55:26,826
Well, we're movin' along.

504
00:56:23,425 --> 00:56:25,802
What's he doing?

505
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:35,520
Is this some kind
of physical therapy?

506
00:56:42,318 --> 00:56:44,696
Hello? Hello?

507
00:56:44,779 --> 00:56:47,240
What? No, you're breaking up.

508
00:56:49,659 --> 00:56:51,995
Hold on. Hold on.

509
00:56:52,037 --> 00:56:55,498
Don't start a fight with him.
Joey, give me your rope.

510
00:56:55,582 --> 00:56:59,127
Just to pull him back.
We'll never get him outta there.
Let me go in after him.

511
00:57:26,029 --> 00:57:29,824
Mr Booker, I'm really not comfortable
with you taking these kind of risks.

512
00:57:46,716 --> 00:57:49,386
- Oh, God!
- Hey, hey! Pilgrim!

513
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:51,596
Let him go!

514
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,723
Let him go.

515
00:58:35,432 --> 00:58:37,809
Does that hurt you?

516
00:58:41,479 --> 00:58:43,440
Only when I kick somebody.

517
00:58:48,695 --> 00:58:50,613
Don't you go to school?

518
00:58:52,782 --> 00:58:55,243
Taking a break.

519
00:58:55,285 --> 00:58:56,911
Don't you?

520
00:58:56,953 --> 00:59:00,832
School term's out early for us
so we can work the ranch.

521
00:59:16,806 --> 00:59:19,142
Look at him out in the pasture.

522
00:59:19,184 --> 00:59:22,896
He must've been a big,
beautiful-lookin' horse.

523
00:59:24,981 --> 00:59:27,650
How was he to ride?

524
00:59:31,946 --> 00:59:34,991
Excuse me.
I've got chores to look after.

525
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:55,553
Are we in the way?

526
01:00:03,311 --> 01:00:05,563
Should we leave?

527
01:00:19,369 --> 01:00:21,454
I guess we'll go then.

528
01:02:37,048 --> 01:02:39,509
From now on,
leave your phone somewhere else.

529
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:55,275
Miss MacLean, would you and
your daughter like to stay for dinner?

530
01:02:59,904 --> 01:03:03,825
Joe, take off your hat at the table.
I don't want to say it again.

531
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:13,835
Uh, dear Lord...

532
01:03:13,877 --> 01:03:16,671
we are humbly thankful
for these gifts...

533
01:03:16,713 --> 01:03:20,884
for the blessings on our home,
our family and our guests.

534
01:03:22,302 --> 01:03:24,054
And bless those that aren't
as fortunate.

535
01:03:24,095 --> 01:03:26,848
Bless all God's creatures. Amen.

536
01:03:26,931 --> 01:03:29,517
- Amen.
- Amen.

537
01:03:29,601 --> 01:03:32,604
- Like some roast beef?
- Looks great. Thanks.

538
01:03:36,941 --> 01:03:38,943
Thank you.

539
01:03:49,162 --> 01:03:51,289
- Want some milk?
- Yeah. Thanks.

540
01:03:58,254 --> 01:04:01,633
Ol' Hank got us
a couple more men...

541
01:04:01,675 --> 01:04:04,010
to move the cattle.

542
01:04:04,094 --> 01:04:07,180
And what kind of cattle
do you raise, Mr Booker?

543
01:04:07,263 --> 01:04:10,266
Well, we run a mixed herd,
but mostly Black Baldies.

544
01:04:10,308 --> 01:04:11,976
And, uh, what're, what're those?

545
01:04:12,018 --> 01:04:15,730
- Black Angus Herefords
instead of straight Herefords.
- Oh, Black Angus.

546
01:04:15,814 --> 01:04:17,399
- There you go.
- Of course.

547
01:04:17,482 --> 01:04:20,068
And, uh, what's,
what's the difference?

548
01:04:20,151 --> 01:04:23,822
- Well, they suit the weather better.
- And their utters are black
instead of pink.

549
01:04:23,905 --> 01:04:26,449
They don't get burnt
with the sun bouncin' off the snow.

550
01:04:26,491 --> 01:04:30,161
- They make good mothers.
- Our daddy raised straight Herefords.

551
01:04:30,203 --> 01:04:33,248
You know, that's interesting. Um--

552
01:04:33,331 --> 01:04:36,251
I've always wondered every time I,
you know, when I go into a restaurant...

553
01:04:36,334 --> 01:04:39,921
what's the difference between a regular
steak and a Black Angus steak?

554
01:04:40,005 --> 01:04:43,466
I can never taste the difference,
but I could swear that one
was more tender than the other.

555
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:48,722
I didn't know there was
that much difference between the cows.

556
01:04:48,805 --> 01:04:51,307
Of course, I've never been on
a cow farm before.

557
01:04:51,349 --> 01:04:53,768
Seems to me that the bulls
have the best of the time.

558
01:04:53,852 --> 01:04:58,940
Just laying around the fields,
waiting for somebody to come along
and ask them to do their work.

559
01:04:59,024 --> 01:05:03,862
You get born a bull,
got a 90% chance of getting castrated,
served up as hamburger.

560
01:05:03,903 --> 01:05:06,448
So on balance,
I reckon I'd choose being a cow.

561
01:05:14,122 --> 01:05:16,541
Yeah.

562
01:05:16,624 --> 01:05:19,919
- Hey, young man.
- You get back up to bed!

563
01:05:24,966 --> 01:05:27,927
So how's the Lazy ''J''
holding up for you?

564
01:05:28,011 --> 01:05:30,430
Oh, it's fine.

565
01:05:30,513 --> 01:05:33,183
I still can't get used to how dark
it gets around here, though.

566
01:05:33,266 --> 01:05:37,520
Every time I leave the ranch,
I hold my breath
until I can see the motel.

567
01:05:37,604 --> 01:05:40,815
Well, by golly,
that's a lot of drive time.

568
01:05:42,317 --> 01:05:46,488
You know, Tom, while you're working
on that horse of theirs...

569
01:05:46,529 --> 01:05:49,949
Annie and Grace should move
into the old creek house.

570
01:05:57,415 --> 01:06:01,878
Nobody's usin' it. It's silly for her
to be driving back and forth...

571
01:06:01,961 --> 01:06:04,381
when she, she don't know her way around
that well.

572
01:06:04,464 --> 01:06:06,966
Well, that's very kind of you,
but really we're fine where we are.

573
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:09,511
Oh, hell, look,
I know the Lazy ''J.''

574
01:06:09,594 --> 01:06:11,680
Whole place is as good
as falling down around your ears.

575
01:06:11,721 --> 01:06:14,974
Frank, they're already
all settled in.

576
01:06:15,058 --> 01:06:17,519
And anyway, I'm sure
they want their privacy.

577
01:06:17,602 --> 01:06:22,023
Well, it's got doors, Diane,
and private as can be.

578
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:25,902
Tom?

579
01:06:25,944 --> 01:06:28,405
I don't have a problem with it.
I think it's up to Annie.

580
01:06:29,698 --> 01:06:32,617
Well, it'd be great for when my dad
comes to visit.

581
01:06:32,701 --> 01:06:35,328
Where is your dad, honey?

582
01:06:35,412 --> 01:06:38,248
He's at home, working.

583
01:06:38,289 --> 01:06:40,250
You know, um-- I don't know, um--

584
01:06:43,586 --> 01:06:48,091
Is it worth it, really? I mean,
how long do you think you'll carry on
working with Pilgrim?

585
01:06:48,133 --> 01:06:50,510
That depends on Pilgrim.

586
01:06:53,263 --> 01:06:56,766
I know. Me, too.
When are you comin' to visit?

587
01:06:59,436 --> 01:07:03,440
Yeah, well, there'll be plenty of room
'cause we're moving down to the ranch.

588
01:07:03,481 --> 01:07:05,942
Yeah, yeah. They've got this really cute
little house down by the creek.

589
01:07:06,026 --> 01:07:08,194
It's really pretty.

590
01:07:08,278 --> 01:07:12,574
Okay. Okay.
I love you, too.

591
01:07:13,241 --> 01:07:15,410
Ho-Hold on.

592
01:07:15,452 --> 01:07:17,454
Dad wants to talk to you.

593
01:07:18,496 --> 01:07:19,998
Hi.

594
01:07:20,081 --> 01:07:22,792
<i>- Well, she sounds like
she's doing all right. How is she?
- Yeah.</i>

595
01:07:24,627 --> 01:07:27,964
You know, I think she seems
to be getting more comfortable
on the ranch...

596
01:07:28,048 --> 01:07:31,426
which is, which is the only reason
I said yes to this move.

597
01:07:31,468 --> 01:07:34,304
Well, that makes sense.

598
01:07:34,387 --> 01:07:38,433
So, how are you doing out there
in Marlboro country?

599
01:07:38,475 --> 01:07:42,187
<i>- Is the magazine complaining at all?
- Yeah, but nothing I can't handle.</i>

600
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:44,939
Lucy says she thinks Gottschalk's
plotting. But what else is new, hmm?

601
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:48,485
So when are you coming home?

602
01:07:48,568 --> 01:07:52,030
You know, I asked him that myself
tonight, and he doesn't know.

603
01:07:52,113 --> 01:07:55,784
Hmm. I miss you, Annie.

604
01:07:56,826 --> 01:07:59,287
Yeah, I know.
We miss you, too.

605
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:04,000
- Good night.
- 'Night.

606
01:08:09,547 --> 01:08:12,175
Did you ask him to come visit?

607
01:08:13,885 --> 01:08:17,430
You already did.
Do you want me to help you pack?

608
01:09:35,592 --> 01:09:38,470
- Hi.
- Howdy.

609
01:09:57,864 --> 01:10:00,367
What's he doing?

610
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:03,661
He's tryin' go get him
to hook on.

611
01:10:09,292 --> 01:10:11,294
How's it going?

612
01:14:30,428 --> 01:14:32,597
Get over there!

613
01:14:45,193 --> 01:14:47,404
Ha! Come on!

614
01:15:37,787 --> 01:15:40,123
Hey, you over there!

615
01:15:40,206 --> 01:15:42,709
Wanna make yourself useful?

616
01:15:44,169 --> 01:15:46,379
- Hey, Hank.
- Yeah?

617
01:15:46,463 --> 01:15:48,506
I think you got a volunteer here.
You wanna take care of her?

618
01:16:00,852 --> 01:16:04,105
Where's Grace? Grace?

619
01:16:51,069 --> 01:16:53,071
- You okay?
- Yeah.

620
01:16:53,113 --> 01:16:55,073
- Cocktail hour yet?
- What?

621
01:16:55,115 --> 01:16:57,575
I said, is it cocktail hour yet?

622
01:17:02,997 --> 01:17:04,916
Come here a second.

623
01:17:07,627 --> 01:17:11,965
You handled that pretty well.
I think it's time you started earning
your keep around here.

624
01:17:12,048 --> 01:17:14,217
So when we're not working,
you're not doing your therapy...

625
01:17:14,259 --> 01:17:17,637
I'd like you to help out
with the horses, you know,
rubbin' them, cleanin' the stalls.

626
01:17:17,721 --> 01:17:19,723
Think you can handle that?

627
01:17:19,764 --> 01:17:23,018
- That's not a question, is it?
- Nope.

628
01:17:24,144 --> 01:17:26,104
Okay.

629
01:17:33,069 --> 01:17:34,487
Hey, cowboy.

630
01:17:34,571 --> 01:17:38,575
<i>When I was out walkin'
one morning for pleasure</i>

631
01:17:38,616 --> 01:17:42,287
<i>Spied a cowpuncher
come a-lopin'along</i>

632
01:17:42,328 --> 01:17:46,458
<i>His hat was throwed back
and his spurs was a-jinglin'</i>

633
01:17:46,499 --> 01:17:50,670
<i>And as he approached
he was singin'this song</i>

634
01:17:54,632 --> 01:17:57,302
Hey, you little ones.
How are you?

635
01:17:57,344 --> 01:18:00,555
He was only 1 8, he had a flat
on his little pickup, and--

636
01:18:00,638 --> 01:18:02,724
You know you're not allowed
to go swimming in the river.

637
01:18:02,807 --> 01:18:05,477
And Marie here made the best pie.
Cherry pie. Go get some.

638
01:18:05,518 --> 01:18:09,397
As luck would have it, he didn't have
all the lug nuts off...

639
01:18:09,481 --> 01:18:13,026
but the jack slipped and fell
right on that rock he calls a head.

640
01:18:15,362 --> 01:18:16,905
Is he okay?

641
01:18:16,988 --> 01:18:19,741
Well, it rearranged his scalp
about 1 2 inches--

642
01:18:19,824 --> 01:18:23,203
But he always dreamed of having a place
where he could raise horses...

643
01:18:23,286 --> 01:18:25,663
and have a whole separate life.

644
01:18:25,705 --> 01:18:28,416
My grandson Joe is named for him.

645
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:31,419
And somebody told him
about a place called Stockett.

646
01:18:31,503 --> 01:18:33,421
He got on his horse
and he rode over there...

647
01:18:33,505 --> 01:18:36,174
and he got off, and he walked
as far as he could one way.

648
01:18:36,257 --> 01:18:39,427
And then he turned around, and he
walked as far as he could to the other.

649
01:18:39,511 --> 01:18:44,099
And then he decided that
that's where he was going to settle.

650
01:18:44,182 --> 01:18:47,602
And that's where we raised
Frank and Tommy.

651
01:18:50,021 --> 01:18:52,607
- Where do you call home?
- She's from New York, Mom.

652
01:18:54,609 --> 01:18:57,487
Um--

653
01:18:57,529 --> 01:19:01,241
Well, I was born in London,
but I'm from all over really.

654
01:19:01,324 --> 01:19:04,494
My father was a diplomat,
and so we moved constantly.

655
01:19:04,536 --> 01:19:06,913
Oh, my.
That sounds very important.

656
01:19:06,996 --> 01:19:08,998
No.

657
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:11,543
No, he was, he was a wonderful man.

658
01:19:11,626 --> 01:19:14,838
He died when I was 1 2, but we,
we lived all over the world.

659
01:19:14,879 --> 01:19:19,134
We-- It's, it's not the same as,
as knowing a place like this.

660
01:19:19,217 --> 01:19:24,556
Well, sometimes people carry it
more on the inside...

661
01:19:24,597 --> 01:19:26,683
than the outside.

662
01:19:29,769 --> 01:19:33,648
<i>If it hadn't have been
for them troublesome doggies--</i>

663
01:19:33,732 --> 01:19:37,527
I suppose I could gather up
some of these cups and plates.

664
01:19:37,569 --> 01:19:39,529
- You guys done with these?
- Yeah?

665
01:19:39,571 --> 01:19:41,531
You better give me that recipe.
It was really--

666
01:19:41,573 --> 01:19:44,367
I know, I know.
Be glad to tell her anything.

667
01:19:44,409 --> 01:19:46,411
This family has quite a history.

668
01:19:46,453 --> 01:19:49,039
Yeah, it's a story, all right.

669
01:19:51,916 --> 01:19:55,503
- I love how she calls him Tommy.
- Yeah, always did.

670
01:19:55,587 --> 01:19:58,256
I think she always favoured him.

671
01:19:59,299 --> 01:20:01,301
She loves tellin' this story about...

672
01:20:01,384 --> 01:20:04,721
when he was two years old,
he ran off...

673
01:20:04,763 --> 01:20:07,891
and they found him sleepin'
in the barn...

674
01:20:07,932 --> 01:20:12,437
between two giant hooves
of a Percheron stallion.

675
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:16,358
He said that horse was protectin' him,
and nobody could convince him otherwise.

676
01:20:50,642 --> 01:20:53,061
Why do you always wear that hat?

677
01:20:53,103 --> 01:20:55,188
'Cause it fits my head.

678
01:20:56,898 --> 01:20:58,858
- Wanna try it on?
- Come on!

679
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:02,487
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do?

680
01:21:02,570 --> 01:21:04,823
Huh? What?
What do you call that?

681
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:07,701
Okay, one more time.

682
01:21:07,742 --> 01:21:10,036
You gonna, you gonna sit on me? Here.

683
01:21:10,078 --> 01:21:12,747
So you can watch this 'cause I don't
wanna do this too many times, okay?

684
01:21:12,789 --> 01:21:15,291
Put your finger up. Okay?

685
01:21:21,631 --> 01:21:25,093
Okay? Loop's knotted, right?

686
01:21:25,176 --> 01:21:29,222
Looks like the only way to get it off
is to break the touch, right?

687
01:21:29,264 --> 01:21:31,266
Now watch.
You watchin'?

688
01:21:31,307 --> 01:21:34,477
Watch careful.

689
01:21:34,561 --> 01:21:36,479
- Again! Again!
- Again! Again! One more time.

690
01:21:36,563 --> 01:21:38,523
Oh, no, no. I don't fall
for that one twice.

691
01:21:38,606 --> 01:21:41,109
Now, you guys get on in
before your mother calls you.

692
01:21:46,906 --> 01:21:49,617
- Here.
- So--

693
01:21:50,744 --> 01:21:52,662
Thank you.

694
01:22:06,468 --> 01:22:10,263
- What?
- Do you ever sit still
for just a minute?

695
01:22:12,223 --> 01:22:15,185
Well, you sit still too long
in New York and you get renovated.

696
01:22:19,522 --> 01:22:22,859
Why is it, Mr Booker,
that sometimes I get the feeling
that you're laughing at me?

697
01:22:22,942 --> 01:22:25,278
I don't know. Why?

698
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:28,823
No. You're supposed to say
you're not laughing at me.

699
01:22:28,907 --> 01:22:32,827
Oh, I see. You take care of both sides
of the conversation, do you?

700
01:22:32,911 --> 01:22:35,538
It's a man's world, Mr Booker.
Most women have to.

701
01:22:37,165 --> 01:22:39,334
You can call me Tom.

702
01:22:42,212 --> 01:22:44,506
Maybe I am laughin' a little bit.

703
01:22:44,547 --> 01:22:47,676
I figure since you're here, it might
be nice to relax into the place a bit.

704
01:22:50,679 --> 01:22:52,597
Yeah.

705
01:22:53,723 --> 01:22:56,518
Well, it's beautiful country.

706
01:22:56,601 --> 01:22:58,687
And I could see having
some kind of a...

707
01:23:00,397 --> 01:23:02,357
you know, vacation place, retreat.

708
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:05,193
But I don't know how you do it
full-time.

709
01:23:06,236 --> 01:23:08,738
Don't you miss
the rest of the world?

710
01:23:08,822 --> 01:23:11,116
What's there to miss?

711
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:13,743
Well, if you've never lived
in a city with...

712
01:23:13,827 --> 01:23:17,372
with museums and theatre and...

713
01:23:17,414 --> 01:23:19,374
and restaurants and music...

714
01:23:19,416 --> 01:23:22,585
uh, well, I can't explain.

715
01:23:22,669 --> 01:23:25,213
Well, does Chicago count?

716
01:23:26,548 --> 01:23:29,759
- You lived in Chicago?
- That's where I met my wife.

717
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:34,931
You, you were, you were married
to a woman in Chicago?

718
01:23:36,349 --> 01:23:38,476
Yeah, really. A woman.

719
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:41,229
No, I'm sorry. I didn't, I didn't--
No, I'm so--

720
01:23:46,568 --> 01:23:48,611
I was studying engineering...

721
01:23:48,695 --> 01:23:51,239
and she was studying music,
the cello.

722
01:23:53,241 --> 01:23:55,160
And I once heard her play
a Dvorak concerto...

723
01:23:55,243 --> 01:23:59,247
and I thought it was
the most beautiful piece of music
I'd ever heard in my life.

724
01:24:03,418 --> 01:24:07,130
So, just who's laughin' at who here?

725
01:25:07,315 --> 01:25:09,234
Jogger, huh?

726
01:25:09,317 --> 01:25:12,362
I don't jog, Mr Booker. I run.

727
01:25:13,196 --> 01:25:15,490
Well, that's lucky for you.

728
01:25:15,532 --> 01:25:18,702
Grizzlies around here
mostly go for joggers.

729
01:25:18,785 --> 01:25:21,955
You sleepin' okay in that house?

730
01:25:21,996 --> 01:25:25,500
Well, I don't sleep well anywhere,
but the house is fine, yeah.

731
01:25:40,432 --> 01:25:43,518
Oop. I have a way with animals.

732
01:25:43,601 --> 01:25:45,520
That's all right.
He's just young.

733
01:25:45,603 --> 01:25:47,772
Here, hold out your hand
just a little lower. That's it.

734
01:25:47,814 --> 01:25:50,066
So he can get the smell of you.

735
01:25:54,279 --> 01:25:56,239
He's beautiful.

736
01:25:57,490 --> 01:26:00,243
-Now, how come you don't ride anymore?
-Hmm?

737
01:26:00,326 --> 01:26:02,996
Grace told me you used to ride
when she was younger.

738
01:26:03,038 --> 01:26:06,458
- She did?
- Yep.

739
01:26:07,459 --> 01:26:09,419
Uh, I don't know.

740
01:26:09,502 --> 01:26:13,465
Uh, no time, I guess.

741
01:26:21,681 --> 01:26:23,641
I thought it was supposed to be spring.

742
01:26:25,685 --> 01:26:27,896
Enjoy the day.

743
01:26:27,979 --> 01:26:29,397
You, too.

744
01:27:25,245 --> 01:27:27,539
Come take a ride with me.

745
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:46,599
- Can you drive?
- Drive? Not old enough.

746
01:27:46,683 --> 01:27:49,686
Well, it's never too soon to start.
Here. Get in.

747
01:27:52,772 --> 01:27:55,442
Uh, I, I can't.

748
01:27:55,525 --> 01:27:57,444
Come on.
I don't have all day.

749
01:28:25,305 --> 01:28:27,640
Put the key in
and turn it on.

750
01:28:28,808 --> 01:28:30,769
- This one?
- Mm-hmm.

751
01:28:35,357 --> 01:28:39,277
Now, the right pedal is the gas.
The other one's the brake.

752
01:28:39,319 --> 01:28:44,157
Uh, I don't think I, I can
with my, uh, with my leg.

753
01:28:44,199 --> 01:28:46,743
Well, there's only one way to find out.
Now, put it in ''D.''

754
01:28:50,997 --> 01:28:53,667
Now give it some gas.

755
01:28:58,838 --> 01:29:01,841
Okay, we know you can.

756
01:29:01,925 --> 01:29:05,136
Now you just gotta feel how much.
Now give it-- Try it again.

757
01:29:09,683 --> 01:29:11,101
There you go.

758
01:29:14,938 --> 01:29:16,398
Nice.

759
01:29:16,481 --> 01:29:20,527
Real nice. Now there's a little road
up at the end here. Turn onto it.

760
01:29:25,532 --> 01:29:28,410
Now just follow this.
Nothin' to it.

761
01:29:29,994 --> 01:29:31,913
I'm gonna kinda close my eyes here
for a little while...

762
01:29:31,996 --> 01:29:35,083
so keep goin'
till you run out of road.

763
01:29:36,376 --> 01:29:39,087
Uh, I, I, I don't think I can.

764
01:29:39,170 --> 01:29:41,339
It's not a question if you can.
You are.

765
01:29:59,691 --> 01:30:02,027
Where'd you get Pilgrim from?

766
01:30:02,068 --> 01:30:03,945
We bought him in Kentucky.

767
01:30:04,029 --> 01:30:07,323
Me and my mom took a trip down there
to see him.

768
01:30:07,407 --> 01:30:09,367
Well, that must've been special.

769
01:30:09,409 --> 01:30:11,369
Yeah.

770
01:30:16,416 --> 01:30:20,253
Are you afraid of anything, Tom Booker?

771
01:30:23,381 --> 01:30:25,425
Oh, growin' old.

772
01:30:25,508 --> 01:30:27,802
Not bein' much use.

773
01:30:32,849 --> 01:30:35,101
Hey, Grace?

774
01:30:35,185 --> 01:30:37,228
What went on out there with Pilgrim?

775
01:30:46,738 --> 01:30:49,449
See, Grace, I got a problem.

776
01:30:49,491 --> 01:30:53,995
When I work with a horse,
I like to know its history.

777
01:30:54,079 --> 01:30:57,040
Now most of the times, a horse,
in its own way, can pretty much
tell you the whole story...

778
01:30:57,123 --> 01:31:01,544
but sometimes they get
so messed up in their head
that you need more to go on.

779
01:31:02,921 --> 01:31:04,964
Now, I don't know how you feel
about talkin' about it...

780
01:31:05,006 --> 01:31:07,342
and if you don't feel like it,
I understand.

781
01:31:09,052 --> 01:31:13,098
But if I'm gonna figure out
what's goin' on in his head...

782
01:31:14,766 --> 01:31:18,311
sure would help me if I understood
exactly what happened that day.

783
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:30,532
You know, not today.
Whenever you feel like it.

784
01:31:31,408 --> 01:31:33,493
I'll leave that up to you.

785
01:31:46,631 --> 01:31:48,550
Uh-oh.

786
01:31:52,929 --> 01:31:56,307
- The answer's no.
- You haven't even heard
the question yet.

787
01:31:56,391 --> 01:31:59,019
Now, the truth is,
you'd be doin' me a real favour.

788
01:31:59,102 --> 01:32:02,397
I got all these young colts
that need ridin'. Rimrock here, he's--

789
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:05,817
- I mean, he's feelin' kinda left out.
- Poor thing.

790
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:10,447
He'd be grateful,
and he'd take real good care with you.

791
01:32:12,699 --> 01:32:16,828
- Is this how you're gonna make me pay
my phone bill?
- No. No, ma'am.

792
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:19,414
That part's extra.

793
01:32:24,878 --> 01:32:28,381
Oh, brought you a hat.

794
01:32:28,423 --> 01:32:31,301
- Oh, I have a hat.
- I know. I've seen it.

795
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:43,563
- I think my stirrups are too long, or--
- No, they're fine.
Just relax your centre.

796
01:32:43,646 --> 01:32:45,231
- Yeah.
-Just sittin' in a bucket.

797
01:32:45,315 --> 01:32:48,401
Well, it's all coming back, you know.
I mean, I'll be fine.

798
01:32:48,485 --> 01:32:51,780
Okay. Well, then
I'll stop talkin' then.

799
01:32:51,863 --> 01:32:55,283
No, I didn't mean that. I-- You know,
I've never ridden western before.

800
01:32:55,367 --> 01:32:58,370
- So--
- Yeah, but he doesn't know that.
Just sit the horse.

801
01:32:58,411 --> 01:33:00,789
- Yeah.
- You have a nice seat.
You're doin' fine.

802
01:33:00,872 --> 01:33:02,791
Thank you.

803
01:33:19,766 --> 01:33:21,768
- You look good. You feel okay?
- Yeah.

804
01:33:21,851 --> 01:33:24,145
- You wanna pick it up a little?
- Yeah.

805
01:33:29,859 --> 01:33:32,112
Watch your reins.

806
01:33:32,153 --> 01:33:34,531
Give him some room.
Let him do the work.

807
01:34:01,891 --> 01:34:04,019
- Okay? You okay?
- Yep.

808
01:34:04,102 --> 01:34:06,271
Let's go.

809
01:35:24,099 --> 01:35:26,476
I envy your mother.

810
01:35:27,727 --> 01:35:30,438
I do.

811
01:35:32,399 --> 01:35:35,610
It must be great to be her age...

812
01:35:35,694 --> 01:35:39,989
and to be at the point in life
when you have no more guesswork.

813
01:35:42,158 --> 01:35:45,995
No more impossible decisions to make.

814
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:49,582
And anyway, it doesn't matter
because all the worries
and all the wrong turns that you made...

815
01:35:49,666 --> 01:35:53,044
are as valuable and as, as...

816
01:35:53,086 --> 01:35:55,547
as cherished as the things
that you did right.

817
01:35:55,588 --> 01:35:59,092
I--
Oh, it must be such a relief.

818
01:36:01,803 --> 01:36:04,431
Must be such peace in that.

819
01:36:06,725 --> 01:36:09,477
Well, I don't think you have to wait to
be her age to find that kind of peace.

820
01:36:11,563 --> 01:36:14,899
Yeah, but how would you know
unless it was all behind you?

821
01:36:14,941 --> 01:36:16,401
Do you have it?

822
01:36:16,443 --> 01:36:19,029
Sometimes. Not all the time,
but sometimes.

823
01:36:19,112 --> 01:36:21,197
When?

824
01:36:21,281 --> 01:36:26,077
Wakin' up on the ranch in the morning,
knowin' what I'm supposed to do
that day.

825
01:36:26,119 --> 01:36:28,079
Knowing I'm home.

826
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:34,127
I wake up every morning, and
I don't know a damn thing. Was I--

827
01:36:38,089 --> 01:36:40,508
Was I right to bring her here,
away from what's familiar...

828
01:36:40,592 --> 01:36:43,178
away from her father, her friends?

829
01:36:45,221 --> 01:36:48,892
And the more I try and fix things,
the more everything falls apart.

830
01:36:49,809 --> 01:36:52,395
Maybe you should let 'em fall.

831
01:36:54,814 --> 01:36:58,234
- No, I can't.
- Why?

832
01:37:11,956 --> 01:37:13,875
Do you think I was right to come?

833
01:37:15,085 --> 01:37:17,712
I can't answer that, Annie.

834
01:37:19,547 --> 01:37:23,426
Well, I'll know soon enough.
If I've made a mistake,
Grace'll let me know.

835
01:37:25,053 --> 01:37:27,889
She's a strong kid.

836
01:37:27,972 --> 01:37:30,183
She gets that from somebody.

837
01:37:40,568 --> 01:37:42,612
Thank you for all you're doing.

838
01:37:42,696 --> 01:37:45,907
You and your family,
letting us stay at the house.

839
01:37:45,990 --> 01:37:48,660
It wasn't gettin' much use.

840
01:37:52,706 --> 01:37:55,208
What was your wife like?

841
01:37:57,168 --> 01:37:59,629
She had reddish hair.

842
01:37:59,713 --> 01:38:03,675
Not, not quite. Almost.
Depended on the light.

843
01:38:05,176 --> 01:38:07,095
She had green eyes.

844
01:38:08,304 --> 01:38:11,266
And when she played, that was it.

845
01:38:12,851 --> 01:38:15,812
Something just went right through me.

846
01:38:15,895 --> 01:38:18,565
I'd never heard music like that
played before.

847
01:38:20,859 --> 01:38:23,236
And the way she looked
when she played it.

848
01:38:26,573 --> 01:38:29,534
And then one day, she looked at me
that way, and that was it...

849
01:38:31,494 --> 01:38:33,413
for both of us.

850
01:38:37,042 --> 01:38:40,503
I knew she didn't want
to be a rancher's wife,
but I wanted to give it a try.

851
01:38:40,587 --> 01:38:44,007
I thought maybe she could
give music lessons to the kids
in town, the school maybe...

852
01:38:45,842 --> 01:38:49,763
and that our kids would grow up with
my brother's kids and play together.

853
01:38:52,682 --> 01:38:56,144
But she wasn't happy here.

854
01:38:56,227 --> 01:38:58,438
''Too much space,'' she said.

855
01:39:00,065 --> 01:39:04,611
- So why didn't you stay in Chicago?
- Wasn't enough space.

856
01:39:07,614 --> 01:39:09,574
It just wasn't meant to be.

857
01:39:12,452 --> 01:39:16,373
But how did you know, for sure?

858
01:39:16,456 --> 01:39:19,793
Knowing's the easy part.
Saying it out loud's the hard part.

859
01:39:24,089 --> 01:39:26,466
Mmm, seems so obvious now,
doesn't it?

860
01:39:27,926 --> 01:39:30,595
''We weren't right for each other.
If only we knew then.''

861
01:39:30,679 --> 01:39:33,682
I didn't love her
'cause it was right.

862
01:39:33,765 --> 01:39:35,684
I just loved her.

863
01:40:12,595 --> 01:40:16,307
For whatever it's worth, Annie,
took a lot of guts for you to come here.

864
01:40:22,981 --> 01:40:24,649
Lift your leg.

865
01:41:40,767 --> 01:41:42,727
Come on. Come on.

866
01:41:47,107 --> 01:41:49,234
Hey,Joe.

867
01:41:50,151 --> 01:41:51,986
Hi.

868
01:41:53,029 --> 01:41:55,949
Would you let me ride your horse?

869
01:42:00,620 --> 01:42:03,665
- Have you talked to Tom about it?
- Of course I have.

870
01:42:06,167 --> 01:42:08,962
I don't know.
You sure Tom said it's all right?

871
01:42:09,045 --> 01:42:11,381
You gonna give me a hand or what?

872
01:42:12,257 --> 01:42:14,217
- You sure?
- Come on.

873
01:42:15,593 --> 01:42:18,096
Okay.

874
01:42:18,179 --> 01:42:20,432
Easy. Hold it.

875
01:42:20,515 --> 01:42:23,351
Okay.

876
01:42:27,397 --> 01:42:29,566
Whoa.

877
01:42:29,649 --> 01:42:33,403
Got it. Got it.
I can do it.

878
01:42:35,363 --> 01:42:37,115
Here.

879
01:42:41,995 --> 01:42:44,080
Are you okay?

880
01:42:57,552 --> 01:42:59,512
Hey!

881
01:42:59,596 --> 01:43:02,265
You better not say anything!

882
01:43:27,957 --> 01:43:31,878
I thought there were too many forks,
so I just, um--

883
01:43:31,961 --> 01:43:35,632
Oh. You look really pretty.

884
01:43:35,715 --> 01:43:37,759
Thanks.

885
01:43:47,977 --> 01:43:50,355
Does anybody want something to drink?

886
01:43:51,272 --> 01:43:53,191
Shit!

887
01:43:55,193 --> 01:43:57,195
Better go give your mom a hand.

888
01:43:57,278 --> 01:43:59,197
Oh, yeah.

889
01:44:00,824 --> 01:44:05,495
- Everything under control here?
- Um, no, not really.

890
01:44:05,578 --> 01:44:08,039
Uh, it's been so long
since I've done this.

891
01:44:08,123 --> 01:44:11,793
I've forgotten. Uh, and
I couldn't find any Parmesan cheese.

892
01:44:11,835 --> 01:44:14,129
Well, you got an easy crowd out there,
as long as it's hot.

893
01:44:14,170 --> 01:44:16,339
Can I do anything?

894
01:44:16,381 --> 01:44:18,341
Uh, just make yourself comfortable.

895
01:44:18,383 --> 01:44:20,343
I am comfortable.

896
01:44:20,385 --> 01:44:24,347
Well, um, in that case
you can bring in the pasta.

897
01:44:25,598 --> 01:44:28,309
- You missed a button.
- Thank you.

898
01:44:34,983 --> 01:44:38,361
You know, I'll have another round
of that spaghetti, if I may.

899
01:44:38,403 --> 01:44:41,698
- Oh, of course.
- Thank you.

900
01:44:41,740 --> 01:44:45,326
I, uh, like the sauce.
Maybe I could get the recipe.

901
01:44:45,368 --> 01:44:48,538
- It's from a jar.
- Oh.

902
01:44:52,375 --> 01:44:54,961
Well, now, you know what?

903
01:44:55,045 --> 01:45:00,216
I, uh, used jar sauce once.
I don't believe it was
near as good as this.

904
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:02,552
- Isn't that right, Frank?
- No.

905
01:45:02,635 --> 01:45:06,222
No. You know, I think you gotta know
which brand to pick.

906
01:45:06,306 --> 01:45:08,433
I sure would like the name
of this one.

907
01:45:11,061 --> 01:45:13,897
Annie, you've given me
a rare night off.

908
01:45:13,980 --> 01:45:17,567
Ooh, you're touchin'
on a sore subject here.

909
01:45:17,650 --> 01:45:21,738
Diane's got these big dreams in her head
about gettin' away to--

910
01:45:21,780 --> 01:45:24,366
- Gosh, what was it? Greece, Morocco?
- Morocco.

911
01:45:24,407 --> 01:45:26,910
One of these places
where women wear masks and...

912
01:45:26,993 --> 01:45:29,371
everybody's runnin' around
in robes and--

913
01:45:29,412 --> 01:45:33,458
- Well, we could use a vacation.
- Mmm. We're going to Branson
for the wedding.

914
01:45:33,541 --> 01:45:35,960
- It is not. You just had a turn.
- You don't know how to play the game.

915
01:45:36,044 --> 01:45:37,379
- Hey!
- Yes, I do.

916
01:45:37,420 --> 01:45:39,089
- You do not.
- Uh-huh.

917
01:45:39,130 --> 01:45:41,091
You know, Frank. You know...

918
01:45:41,132 --> 01:45:44,469
Branson, Missouri
is not exactly Morocco.

919
01:45:44,552 --> 01:45:48,390
I got family there. Got no family
in Morocco, far as I know.

920
01:45:48,431 --> 01:45:50,600
- It's my turn.
- Is not.
- You had a turn.

921
01:45:50,684 --> 01:45:53,228
- Was not.
- Was so!
- Boys, settle down.

922
01:45:53,311 --> 01:45:55,772
- You're just showin' off for her.
- Shut up, stupid.

923
01:45:55,855 --> 01:45:58,525
-You're the only one who's stupid,
lettin' her go and fall off your horse.
-Hey, boys.

924
01:45:58,608 --> 01:46:01,820
- Oh, you little turd.
- I saw 'em in the pasture,
her tryin' to get on Gonzo.

925
01:46:01,903 --> 01:46:03,947
- Hey, boys!
- I saw 'em.
- Oh, you turd.

926
01:46:04,030 --> 01:46:05,615
Joe!

927
01:46:05,699 --> 01:46:07,701
- Did you go riding?
- No!

928
01:46:07,784 --> 01:46:09,369
- Get up off that floor.
- Out you go.
- Get outta here.

929
01:46:09,452 --> 01:46:11,496
- Right now. Out the door.
- Go on home now.
- I didn't start it.

930
01:46:11,579 --> 01:46:14,457
- My gosh!
- Here, here.Joe,Joe. Hey.
- Come on, let's go. Right now. Come on.

931
01:46:14,541 --> 01:46:16,292
- Let's go.
- What's the matter with you boys?
- Annie, I'm so sorry.

932
01:46:16,376 --> 01:46:18,670
They're just tired. We, we should
just get 'em home to bed.

933
01:46:18,753 --> 01:46:21,589
- Say good night and thank you.
- Annie, the dinner was delicious.

934
01:46:21,673 --> 01:46:24,342
- Thank you so much. It was wonderful.
- Thank you. You, say thank you.

935
01:46:24,426 --> 01:46:27,679
- Thank you.
-Joe, did Grace try to ride?

936
01:46:27,762 --> 01:46:30,765
I expect you should talk to Grace
about that, ma'am.

937
01:46:30,849 --> 01:46:33,018
If I did anything wrong,
I'm sorry.

938
01:46:37,647 --> 01:46:40,191
Don't let her turn you away.

939
01:47:22,317 --> 01:47:23,860
Grace?

940
01:47:25,111 --> 01:47:27,072
Is everything all right?

941
01:47:31,493 --> 01:47:35,038
- Did you try riding again?
- Yeah.

942
01:47:36,164 --> 01:47:38,291
Does that mean I'm cured?

943
01:47:40,877 --> 01:47:43,046
Nobody's trying to cure you.

944
01:47:47,592 --> 01:47:51,596
Look, I just wanna say I think
it's great that you're riding again.

945
01:47:55,266 --> 01:47:57,602
- And I think I know why
you needed to--
- Yeah, you know everything.

946
01:48:00,897 --> 01:48:05,902
Stop it.
Why won't you let me talk to you?
Why are you so angry with me?

947
01:48:05,985 --> 01:48:08,571
Whatever I do, it's wrong.
Whatever I say, it's wrong.

948
01:48:08,655 --> 01:48:12,409
Yeah? Well, now you know
how it feels.

949
01:48:12,492 --> 01:48:15,286
Look, I, I know that
I'm hard on you sometimes.

950
01:48:15,370 --> 01:48:18,415
- Right.
- And I'm sorry if that
makes you feel this way.

951
01:48:18,498 --> 01:48:20,208
But if I push you,
it's only because I want--

952
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:22,794
Because if I'm the perfect daughter,
that makes you the perfect mother,
right?

953
01:48:22,877 --> 01:48:24,796
I don't deserve that!

954
01:48:25,797 --> 01:48:27,757
I don't push for me.

955
01:48:27,799 --> 01:48:32,554
I push for you so that
you don't spend half your life
not knowing where you belong.

956
01:48:32,595 --> 01:48:35,223
Yeah? Well, you've done a great job.

957
01:48:36,933 --> 01:48:39,227
Yeah.

958
01:48:48,570 --> 01:48:52,282
Who's ever gonna want me like this?

959
01:49:01,583 --> 01:49:03,501
Don't cry.

960
01:49:08,298 --> 01:49:13,219
Who's ever gonna want me like this?
Nobody will.

961
01:49:17,724 --> 01:49:22,854
I know it sometimes doesn't seem
this way, but I do understand what,
what you're feeling.

962
01:49:24,814 --> 01:49:29,027
When I was your age,
and when my, when my dad died...

963
01:49:29,110 --> 01:49:31,946
I'd felt like I'd lost everything
and I'd be all alone, and--

964
01:49:35,825 --> 01:49:38,453
And-- But I've got you.

965
01:49:41,623 --> 01:49:45,001
I used to pray every night...

966
01:49:45,043 --> 01:49:48,421
that you and Dad
would have another kid...

967
01:49:48,505 --> 01:49:52,842
so I wouldn't have to be
so, uh, special.

968
01:49:55,804 --> 01:49:57,472
I, I know.

969
01:50:02,894 --> 01:50:06,856
And I know how, how hard it must be
to have lost your best friend...

970
01:50:06,940 --> 01:50:10,944
and have your body be different
than from how you'd like it to be.

971
01:50:15,365 --> 01:50:20,286
But one day, somebody will look
at this extraordinary woman
that you're becoming and...

972
01:50:21,538 --> 01:50:24,749
all they'll see
is how much they love you.

973
01:50:29,754 --> 01:50:32,340
That's all I see.

974
01:52:10,397 --> 01:52:12,691
<i>- Yep?
- Hello, this is A T& T
Conference Service.</i>

975
01:52:12,774 --> 01:52:15,777
<i>- Is this Annie MacLean?
- Yes.</i>

976
01:52:15,819 --> 01:52:19,155
<i>I have a conference call scheduled
for you with Mr Gottschalk
and Mr Felton.</i>

977
01:52:19,197 --> 01:52:21,950
Mr Felton.
Hold on, please.

978
01:52:27,956 --> 01:52:29,499
Okay, I'm ready.

979
01:54:04,761 --> 01:54:07,138
I've been waiting for you
to come back.

980
01:54:10,183 --> 01:54:11,685
Are you hungry?

981
01:54:19,442 --> 01:54:22,779
Judith was, um,
telling me about this boy.

982
01:54:24,614 --> 01:54:27,075
I never even got his name.

983
01:54:30,036 --> 01:54:32,455
We were gonna go around
the railroad bridge.

984
01:54:34,958 --> 01:54:38,753
We were laughing about something.
I don't know what.

985
01:54:39,963 --> 01:54:44,092
And, um, her horse fell...

986
01:54:44,134 --> 01:54:46,261
and Judith's foot
was caught in the stirrup.

987
01:54:49,681 --> 01:54:52,434
And she was so scared.

988
01:54:58,940 --> 01:55:03,862
And next I saw this truck
coming around the turn.

989
01:55:08,992 --> 01:55:12,328
And it was honking,
trying to get us to move.

990
01:55:13,747 --> 01:55:18,918
And I, I-I tried
to grab her reins and...

991
01:55:19,002 --> 01:55:21,421
to get her horse
to move out of the way.

992
01:55:23,715 --> 01:55:26,217
And the truck started to skid.

993
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:34,642
And th-there was no time
to do anything.

994
01:55:34,684 --> 01:55:37,228
It ran right into Judith, and--

995
01:55:39,105 --> 01:55:42,901
And she just disappeared.

996
01:55:49,616 --> 01:55:52,035
And then it came
at Pilgrim and me.

997
01:55:53,620 --> 01:55:56,414
And Pilgrim reared up
at the truck.

998
01:55:58,792 --> 01:56:01,419
And I fell off.

999
01:56:05,757 --> 01:56:08,843
But Judith--
Oh, God,Judith.

1000
01:56:14,891 --> 01:56:17,686
- I'm so sorry,Judith.
- Grace.

1001
01:56:31,408 --> 01:56:36,121
Now, I'm not gonna tell ya
it's gonna stop feelin' this bad.

1002
01:56:36,204 --> 01:56:38,957
But I will tell you
you didn't do anything wrong.

1003
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:40,959
The same thing
could've happened to me...

1004
01:56:41,042 --> 01:56:44,546
or to Frank or to Joey.

1005
01:56:44,587 --> 01:56:48,717
And it doesn't make any sense
to try to figure out
why these things happen.

1006
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:55,098
There was a boy from
the Blackfeet reservation.

1007
01:56:55,140 --> 01:56:57,100
He used to do some work around here
for a while.

1008
01:56:57,142 --> 01:56:59,978
Sixteen, strong kid, good kid.

1009
01:57:00,061 --> 01:57:02,605
He and I were
really, really good friends.

1010
01:57:02,689 --> 01:57:06,651
One day he went swimmin'
and dove headfirst into the lake...

1011
01:57:06,735 --> 01:57:08,653
and right into a rock.

1012
01:57:10,196 --> 01:57:13,908
And it snapped his neck,
paralysed him.

1013
01:57:15,910 --> 01:57:17,871
And after the accident...

1014
01:57:17,954 --> 01:57:19,956
I'd look in on him
from time to time.

1015
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:25,128
But he wasn't there.

1016
01:57:25,170 --> 01:57:28,798
It was like his mind, his spirit,
whatever you want to call it,
just disappeared.

1017
01:57:31,468 --> 01:57:33,762
The only thing left
was just anger.

1018
01:57:35,347 --> 01:57:37,724
Just sort of as if the...

1019
01:57:37,807 --> 01:57:41,186
the boy I once knew
just went somewhere else.

1020
01:57:43,021 --> 01:57:45,023
I know where he goes.

1021
01:57:48,943 --> 01:57:50,945
I know you do.

1022
01:57:52,155 --> 01:57:54,824
Don't you disappear.

1023
01:57:54,866 --> 01:57:57,369
You do whatever you have to do
to hold on.

1024
01:57:58,370 --> 01:58:00,580
I'll tell you one more thing.

1025
01:58:00,663 --> 01:58:04,584
You know when Pilgrim
reared up against that truck?

1026
01:58:04,668 --> 01:58:07,462
You know what I think?

1027
01:58:07,504 --> 01:58:11,800
I think that damned horse
loved you so much
he was tryin' to protect you.

1028
01:58:13,677 --> 01:58:16,179
That's what I think.

1029
02:00:29,020 --> 02:00:31,648
- How did you get like this?
- No, no, no. Get up.

1030
02:00:31,731 --> 02:00:34,150
Let me show you.

1031
02:00:55,255 --> 02:00:57,841
- Wanna see it again?
- Yep.

1032
02:00:57,924 --> 02:00:59,843
- Can you do it without smiling?
- Yep.

1033
02:00:59,926 --> 02:01:03,388
No, you can't. Not possible.
I can feel the muscles right--

1034
02:01:03,471 --> 02:01:06,766
- Try me.
- I can feel the muscles right--

1035
02:01:22,407 --> 02:01:24,868
Must be nice to have a few days
off work, huh?

1036
02:01:24,951 --> 02:01:27,328
Yeah. Yeah.

1037
02:01:29,372 --> 02:01:32,834
It's more than a few days, though.
I'm not an editor anymore.

1038
02:01:35,170 --> 02:01:38,882
- First time I said it out loud.
- They fired ya?

1039
02:01:40,300 --> 02:01:42,552
No, no. It's more like a--

1040
02:01:44,596 --> 02:01:47,766
Yeah. They fired me.

1041
02:01:49,142 --> 02:01:53,605
- You don't seem too upset about it.
- Delayed shock.

1042
02:01:53,688 --> 02:01:57,400
Or maybe not.

1043
02:01:57,484 --> 02:02:01,905
I'm sure I can talk my way back in there
or get another magazine someplace.

1044
02:02:01,988 --> 02:02:06,368
But maybe I don't-- Well, I'm just
not sure I-- I'm not sure I want to.

1045
02:02:06,409 --> 02:02:09,537
Well, I guess you don't have
to figure it out till you get home.

1046
02:02:15,210 --> 02:02:17,379
- See, when you hit like a windmill...
- Yeah.

1047
02:02:17,420 --> 02:02:19,381
it's not gonna do any good.

1048
02:02:19,422 --> 02:02:21,716
But if you hit down,
like you can hit a golf club...

1049
02:02:21,758 --> 02:02:25,387
come back down,
down into it.

1050
02:02:27,430 --> 02:02:30,100
Did you always know
this is the life you wanted?

1051
02:02:32,435 --> 02:02:35,021
Well, I was a rancher's daughter.

1052
02:02:35,105 --> 02:02:40,110
I guess it's not too far to go
to becomin' a rancher's wife. Yeah.

1053
02:02:41,361 --> 02:02:44,280
Yeah. Frank's a good man.

1054
02:02:44,322 --> 02:02:46,616
Oh, they don't come better.

1055
02:02:50,078 --> 02:02:54,916
I don't deny there are times I think
about all the things I won't have.

1056
02:02:54,958 --> 02:02:59,170
Maybe I'll get to see Morocco.
Probably not.

1057
02:03:08,304 --> 02:03:10,974
Did Tom have many girlfriends
after his divorce?

1058
02:03:16,479 --> 02:03:18,815
Hey, look, Annie,
I'm not good at this sort of talk.

1059
02:03:18,857 --> 02:03:22,819
Goes around and round somethin',
and never gets to it,
so let's just say what it is.

1060
02:03:25,655 --> 02:03:28,450
Tom means so much to this family.

1061
02:03:28,491 --> 02:03:31,661
Don't you go lookin' here
for whatever it is you're lookin' for.

1062
02:03:33,580 --> 02:03:36,374
Don't make that man go through
somethin' that took him so long...

1063
02:03:36,458 --> 02:03:38,335
to see his way clear of
in the first place.

1064
02:03:38,376 --> 02:03:41,421
I don't think Tom would do anything
he didn't want to do.

1065
02:03:41,504 --> 02:03:46,468
Yeah. He's a good man.

1066
02:03:46,509 --> 02:03:51,014
Ooh, he's got a gift.
Comes from heaven above, I swear.

1067
02:03:51,097 --> 02:03:53,475
But he's still just a man.

1068
02:03:58,438 --> 02:04:02,192
<i>Bitter raindrops glisten</i>

1069
02:04:02,233 --> 02:04:06,571
<i>On the painted Injun flower</i>

1070
02:04:06,654 --> 02:04:10,367
<i>Honey child, the mornin'</i>

1071
02:04:10,408 --> 02:04:12,619
<i>Loves you true</i>

1072
02:04:14,537 --> 02:04:18,792
<i>The muddy road
is brown and still</i>

1073
02:04:18,875 --> 02:04:23,046
<i>As far as you can see</i>

1074
02:04:23,088 --> 02:04:27,926
<i>Honey child, the noontime is--</i>

1075
02:05:12,595 --> 02:05:14,597
Couldn't, um--

1076
02:05:59,100 --> 02:06:01,227
There's something I need to know.

1077
02:06:04,731 --> 02:06:06,649
Are you sure?

1078
02:06:21,498 --> 02:06:23,500
Gotta get back.

1079
02:07:11,548 --> 02:07:14,092
Dad?

1080
02:07:18,346 --> 02:07:20,390
Dad!

1081
02:07:25,353 --> 02:07:28,231
- Diane. It's a pleasure. Welcome.
- Diane.

1082
02:07:28,314 --> 02:07:30,859
- Hello. Frank.
- Hello, Frank.

1083
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:32,902
- This is our oldest boy,Joe.
- Hi,Joe.

1084
02:07:32,944 --> 02:07:35,864
- And, and this is Mr Booker.
- Tom.

1085
02:07:35,905 --> 02:07:38,074
- Hi, Tom.
- It's a pleasure.

1086
02:07:38,116 --> 02:07:42,454
And I want to thank you
for the way you took in my girls here.

1087
02:07:42,537 --> 02:07:45,248
I can already see a difference in them.
Very grateful to you.

1088
02:07:45,290 --> 02:07:48,418
Dad? Dad, did you notice?
No cane.

1089
02:07:48,501 --> 02:07:51,171
I know. It's amazing.

1090
02:07:51,254 --> 02:07:53,381
- Could we show him Pilgrim, Tom?
- You bet.

1091
02:07:53,423 --> 02:07:56,092
- Let's go get your bags.
- Need a hand, Annie?

1092
02:07:56,134 --> 02:07:58,136
- Yep.
- See you later.

1093
02:08:00,138 --> 02:08:02,891
So at this point I'm,
I'm pretty sure I'm lost.

1094
02:08:02,932 --> 02:08:06,770
So I stopped by this general store and
ask if anyone knows the Booker ranch.

1095
02:08:06,853 --> 02:08:11,274
And this, this nice, uh, older gentleman
with a bandage on his head...

1096
02:08:11,358 --> 02:08:14,486
uh, gave me directions.

1097
02:08:14,569 --> 02:08:17,906
- Sweet Jesus. That's Henry Vanoker.
- Oh.

1098
02:08:17,947 --> 02:08:20,241
I'm surprised you didn't wind up
in Mexico.

1099
02:08:21,743 --> 02:08:24,913
Well, once when, uh, Dad was in India,
he, he got lost...

1100
02:08:24,954 --> 02:08:26,915
way, way up in these mountains.

1101
02:08:26,956 --> 02:08:30,460
And when he finally found his way back,
everyone said that he had discovered
a new route.

1102
02:08:30,543 --> 02:08:32,212
And they redid all the maps.

1103
02:08:32,295 --> 02:08:34,839
Well, now how'd you end up
in India, Robert?

1104
02:08:34,923 --> 02:08:37,342
Oh, this is right after college.
I was in the Peace Corps.

1105
02:08:37,425 --> 02:08:39,427
Well, that's where he met Mom.

1106
02:08:39,469 --> 02:08:42,263
<i>Hey, tell 'em about when, uh,
Mom went looking for Tubab.</i>

1107
02:08:42,305 --> 02:08:44,432
- No, honey, I--
- Oh, Dad! Come on, Dad.

1108
02:08:44,474 --> 02:08:49,145
Uh, well, Mom was a writer,
and, um, Dad knows the rest.

1109
02:08:49,229 --> 02:08:52,565
- Come on.
- She was a journalist
for an English periodical.

1110
02:08:52,649 --> 02:08:55,110
<i>- Uh, what was it called?
- Cambridge Monthly.</i>

1111
02:08:55,151 --> 02:09:00,657
Right. And she decided to go to India
all by herself without knowing a soul.

1112
02:09:00,740 --> 02:09:04,661
<i>Uh, she had no place to stay, but
she was, she was told to look up Tubab.</i>

1113
02:09:04,703 --> 02:09:07,163
<i>- Tubab?
- She comes to my door...</i>

1114
02:09:07,247 --> 02:09:11,042
suitcase and typewriter...

1115
02:09:11,126 --> 02:09:14,045
<i>and asks where Tubab is,
and I said, ''Right here.''</i>

1116
02:09:14,129 --> 02:09:18,341
<i>And she said, ''You're Tubab?''
I said, ''No, my name is Robert.</i>

1117
02:09:18,425 --> 02:09:21,511
<i>Tubab means white man,
and yes, I am.''</i>

1118
02:09:26,808 --> 02:09:28,810
And that was how we met.

1119
02:10:09,893 --> 02:10:13,229
Small bed.
Maybe I should sleep in the barn.

1120
02:10:14,856 --> 02:10:16,775
You're allergic to hay.

1121
02:10:17,817 --> 02:10:20,820
I, I apologize
for the surprise.

1122
02:10:20,904 --> 02:10:24,824
- But the days only opened yesterday,
and I figured that--
- You don't have to apologize.

1123
02:10:26,159 --> 02:10:28,578
You have every right to be here.

1124
02:10:39,506 --> 02:10:42,258
You were right to bring her here.

1125
02:10:45,303 --> 02:10:48,765
Well, there've been plenty of times
I wasn't so sure.

1126
02:10:53,770 --> 02:10:55,730
Must be tired, huh?

1127
02:10:59,109 --> 02:11:00,568
Yeah.

1128
02:11:57,876 --> 02:12:02,505
And then out here, not far from this,
I'll show you the, uh, bulls--

1129
02:12:14,100 --> 02:12:16,019
- Sorry about that.
- Oh, that's okay.

1130
02:12:18,855 --> 02:12:23,526
- I can't believe it's the same horse.
- We still have a ways to go.

1131
02:12:24,652 --> 02:12:27,530
So, uh, how much longer do you think?

1132
02:12:27,614 --> 02:12:30,492
Like I told your wife,
it's really up to Pilgrim.

1133
02:12:31,618 --> 02:12:33,745
Uh-huh.

1134
02:13:32,303 --> 02:13:36,057
- Dad, will you come dance? Please, Dad.
- All right.

1135
02:13:43,940 --> 02:13:47,152
<i>Daylight has found me</i>

1136
02:13:47,235 --> 02:13:51,156
<i>Here again</i>

1137
02:13:54,284 --> 02:13:59,247
<i>You can ask me anything</i>

1138
02:13:59,289 --> 02:14:01,291
<i>But where I've been</i>

1139
02:14:05,587 --> 02:14:09,257
<i>You should know the reason</i>

1140
02:14:09,299 --> 02:14:12,802
<i>Why I called</i>

1141
02:14:15,972 --> 02:14:18,016
<i>I was lookin'for</i>

1142
02:14:18,099 --> 02:14:22,645
<i>A soft place to fall</i>

1143
02:14:27,150 --> 02:14:31,863
<i>Lookin'for a soft place</i>

1144
02:14:31,946 --> 02:14:36,743
<i>Nothin'more than
a small taste</i>

1145
02:14:37,994 --> 02:14:41,498
<i>Of a love that ended</i>

1146
02:14:41,539 --> 02:14:44,751
<i>Long ago</i>

1147
02:14:48,630 --> 02:14:52,634
<i>Lookin'for a place to hide</i>

1148
02:14:53,718 --> 02:14:58,014
<i>A warm bed on a cold night</i>

1149
02:14:59,432 --> 02:15:03,144
<i>I didn't mean to hurt you</i>

1150
02:15:03,186 --> 02:15:05,855
<i>No, no, no</i>

1151
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:35,593
<i>Lookin'out your window</i>

1152
02:15:35,677 --> 02:15:38,096
<i>At the dawn</i>

1153
02:15:42,642 --> 02:15:46,271
<i>Baby, when you wake up</i>

1154
02:15:46,354 --> 02:15:49,232
<i>I'll be gone</i>

1155
02:15:53,528 --> 02:15:57,073
<i>You're the one who taught me</i>

1156
02:15:57,115 --> 02:15:59,451
<i>After all</i>

1157
02:16:04,164 --> 02:16:09,294
<i>How to find a soft place</i>

1158
02:16:09,377 --> 02:16:11,379
<i>To fall</i>

1159
02:17:10,271 --> 02:17:13,942
- The summer is really very brief.
- Oh, there's no time at all.

1160
02:17:14,025 --> 02:17:18,238
After I doctor those fellas,
do you want me to put them
in the upper or lower pasture?

1161
02:17:18,279 --> 02:17:20,407
- Well, upper.
- Okay.

1162
02:17:20,448 --> 02:17:22,951
That's very short, very short.

1163
02:17:23,034 --> 02:17:25,453
You grew up here?
This is, this is where you're from?

1164
02:17:25,495 --> 02:17:28,373
I, I wasn't born here,
but I've always--

1165
02:17:28,456 --> 02:17:32,502
- The winter is real--
- I asked Annie.
Of course she didn't know.

1166
02:17:32,585 --> 02:17:35,755
- What do you do?
- Well, of course that's the time
we gotta feed cattle...

1167
02:17:35,839 --> 02:17:38,466
and hope the majority of'em
survive the summer here.

1168
02:17:43,138 --> 02:17:45,098
Is this how it's gonna be now, hmm?

1169
02:17:45,181 --> 02:17:47,642
You don't speak to me?
We don't speak to each other?

1170
02:17:47,726 --> 02:17:50,020
Well, I'm speaking to you now,
so say something.

1171
02:17:50,103 --> 02:17:51,938
- No.
- Why?

1172
02:17:52,022 --> 02:17:54,482
- I can't get in the middle of this.
- Well, I'm afraid you are
in the middle of this.

1173
02:17:54,566 --> 02:17:58,945
- He's a good man, Annie.
- I never said he wasn't.
I can't change the way I feel.

1174
02:17:59,029 --> 02:18:01,573
- You gotta figure out what you want.
- Do you know what you want?

1175
02:18:01,656 --> 02:18:05,285
I do know what I want. And I'm tryin'
real hard not to get lost in this.

1176
02:18:07,996 --> 02:18:10,373
I never expected
to feel this way again.

1177
02:18:13,835 --> 02:18:17,047
Annie, this is where I belong.
This is who I am.

1178
02:18:17,130 --> 02:18:19,049
Is this what you want?

1179
02:18:21,509 --> 02:18:23,636
Yeah.

1180
02:18:24,512 --> 02:18:26,765
Are you sure?

1181
02:18:28,683 --> 02:18:30,894
Yeah.

1182
02:18:33,521 --> 02:18:36,733
Can you tell that to your family?
To Robert? To Grace?

1183
02:18:39,277 --> 02:18:44,616
If you had a chance to go home
and change things, would you?

1184
02:18:45,867 --> 02:18:48,953
You can't ask me that.
It's not that simple.

1185
02:18:51,331 --> 02:18:53,083
It is.

1186
02:19:01,174 --> 02:19:03,093
It's not fair.

1187
02:19:06,012 --> 02:19:08,723
No, it's not fair.

1188
02:19:34,666 --> 02:19:37,544
There's something
you gotta do tomorrow, boy.

1189
02:21:33,785 --> 02:21:37,664
He'll be okay, Grace.
Just hang on there a minute or two.

1190
02:21:37,706 --> 02:21:40,709
Tom will get him all right.

1191
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:45,607
- What are you doing?
- Gonna have to do somethin' different,
Grace.

1192
02:22:46,608 --> 02:22:50,737
It's not gonna hurt him, right?

1193
02:22:50,779 --> 02:22:53,281
Nothing we've done has hurt him.

1194
02:22:53,323 --> 02:22:57,452
Grace, this is Pilgrim's chance,
and it's yours, too.

1195
02:22:58,995 --> 02:23:01,623
Okay.

1196
02:23:05,669 --> 02:23:09,964
Let him get everything ready.
Come on, Grace.

1197
02:23:25,480 --> 02:23:27,524
Come along.

1198
02:23:54,050 --> 02:23:57,178
That's enough! Stop!

1199
02:25:29,479 --> 02:25:32,899
- Grace, this is where you come in.
- No.

1200
02:25:32,982 --> 02:25:34,317
Come on.

1201
02:25:47,163 --> 02:25:49,708
Okay, I want you
to get down here, Grace.

1202
02:25:53,169 --> 02:25:58,383
- Grace, I want you to come over here
and sit next to me.
- But--

1203
02:25:58,466 --> 02:26:01,094
- But, why, why would he let me--
- Grace, look at him.

1204
02:26:02,137 --> 02:26:03,847
Look at him.

1205
02:26:03,930 --> 02:26:09,269
He's okay. And you never did anything
to let him down.

1206
02:26:09,310 --> 02:26:10,979
- No.
- Grace, listen to me.
- No, I can't.

1207
02:26:11,062 --> 02:26:13,273
Grace, you've gotta do this.

1208
02:26:15,525 --> 02:26:20,071
Trust me just one more time.

1209
02:26:25,452 --> 02:26:30,582
- Do what?
- I want you to come over here
and sit next to me.

1210
02:26:30,665 --> 02:26:34,627
Start right here where the neck is and
the head, and I want you to stroke him.

1211
02:26:34,669 --> 02:26:37,589
I want you to rub him
and feel him all over.

1212
02:26:41,134 --> 02:26:42,886
That's it.

1213
02:26:44,179 --> 02:26:46,848
That's it.

1214
02:26:46,890 --> 02:26:49,392
That's it. Go on ahead.

1215
02:28:01,798 --> 02:28:04,092
Grace.

1216
02:28:04,134 --> 02:28:07,762
Now we're going to show Pilgrim here
how to help you get on him.

1217
02:28:07,846 --> 02:28:11,850
Because, you see, there's a point where
neither of you is gonna need me anymore.

1218
02:28:13,184 --> 02:28:15,103
And we're there.

1219
02:28:19,232 --> 02:28:22,861
I'm not askin'.
Put your leg over the saddle here.

1220
02:28:29,117 --> 02:28:31,077
That a girl.

1221
02:28:41,963 --> 02:28:45,133
Now, we're gonna rock him up.

1222
02:31:47,148 --> 02:31:49,317
Oh.

1223
02:31:54,656 --> 02:31:58,159
- Dad.
- Honey, you were wonderful.

1224
02:32:25,937 --> 02:32:28,064
Hey there! Gettin' ready
to go home, are ya?

1225
02:32:28,148 --> 02:32:30,567
Mm-hmm. Is Tom around?

1226
02:32:30,650 --> 02:32:35,697
No, he went to Sheridan to get
some horses. He left last night.

1227
02:32:38,283 --> 02:32:42,996
Um, when's he coming back?

1228
02:32:43,038 --> 02:32:46,291
Oh, I don't rightly know.

1229
02:32:46,374 --> 02:32:49,669
Let me know when you need some help
loadin' Pilgrim, okay?

1230
02:32:49,711 --> 02:32:51,671
Yeah.

1231
02:32:58,636 --> 02:33:01,931
- What time's your flight?
- 1 2:1 5.

1232
02:33:02,015 --> 02:33:04,851
The Bookers want to leave
for the airport by 9:30.

1233
02:33:06,603 --> 02:33:09,647
Sure you want to drive Pilgrim back?

1234
02:33:09,731 --> 02:33:14,486
Well, I already know the way, and it's
not like I have a job to rush home to.

1235
02:33:15,779 --> 02:33:18,531
To tell you the truth,
I could use the time alone.

1236
02:33:21,743 --> 02:33:26,873
- When are you planning to start?
- Oh, I guess I'll leave
when you and Grace go.

1237
02:33:28,208 --> 02:33:30,418
May I make a suggestion?

1238
02:33:30,502 --> 02:33:32,962
What?

1239
02:33:33,046 --> 02:33:35,090
Take your time.

1240
02:33:37,592 --> 02:33:41,096
What's the matter?
You look like there's something wrong.

1241
02:33:43,598 --> 02:33:45,892
I'll tell you something, Annie.

1242
02:33:47,977 --> 02:33:52,065
I stood there looking at that horse,
and I swear I felt like the same thing
was happening to me.

1243
02:33:55,276 --> 02:33:57,779
And I have two choices.

1244
02:33:57,821 --> 02:34:02,450
I can either fight
the way things are...

1245
02:34:02,534 --> 02:34:04,452
or accept them.

1246
02:34:06,454 --> 02:34:08,456
See, um...

1247
02:34:09,874 --> 02:34:12,711
I always knew I loved you more.

1248
02:34:13,795 --> 02:34:16,256
Didn't bother me.

1249
02:34:16,297 --> 02:34:21,845
I guess I felt kind of lucky,
a little amazed that...

1250
02:34:21,928 --> 02:34:25,515
a woman like you would want to be
with a man like me.

1251
02:34:27,475 --> 02:34:30,437
And I guess I thought if I could
do everything right-- If I could--

1252
02:34:30,478 --> 02:34:33,982
If I was the best husband I could be,
the best father...

1253
02:34:34,065 --> 02:34:37,777
even, even being
a good lawyer only mattered
because of what it meant for us.

1254
02:34:37,819 --> 02:34:40,989
If I could do all that...

1255
02:34:41,072 --> 02:34:44,951
it wouldn't make any difference
if we loved each other the same or not.

1256
02:34:47,620 --> 02:34:49,664
I didn't ask for more.

1257
02:34:49,706 --> 02:34:53,668
I told myself I didn't need any more.

1258
02:34:53,752 --> 02:34:55,754
But...

1259
02:34:57,839 --> 02:35:02,052
the truth is, you don't know
how you feel about me.

1260
02:35:04,846 --> 02:35:08,016
You don't know if you want
a life with me anymore.

1261
02:35:11,686 --> 02:35:14,022
And the truth is...

1262
02:35:17,067 --> 02:35:21,321
I don't want you to come home
until you do know...

1263
02:35:21,363 --> 02:35:23,448
one way or the other.

1264
02:35:25,533 --> 02:35:27,452
Okay?

1265
02:36:08,868 --> 02:36:10,578
- Thanks,Joe.
- Yep.

1266
02:36:18,586 --> 02:36:22,257
Goodbye, Annie.
Good luck to ya.

1267
02:36:22,298 --> 02:36:25,802
Thank you. And, and you, too.

1268
02:36:28,805 --> 02:36:33,518
- All right, everybody in.
Frank, we all set?
- I believe so.

1269
02:36:33,601 --> 02:36:37,605
- I can't believe he's not here
to say goodbye.
- Oh, he probably got held up is all.

1270
02:36:37,647 --> 02:36:41,026
No, sweetie. The truth is,
he's not real good at goodbyes.

1271
02:36:41,109 --> 02:36:44,529
You know, come to think of it,
not too good at hellos either.

1272
02:36:44,612 --> 02:36:46,114
Frank.

1273
02:36:46,197 --> 02:36:48,491
- You ready?
-Just a second.

1274
02:36:53,580 --> 02:36:56,249
- When will you be home?
- Oh, in a few days.

1275
02:36:56,291 --> 02:36:58,251
I'll miss you.

1276
02:36:58,293 --> 02:37:01,171
Well, if I get lost, you know where
to send the search party.

1277
02:37:01,254 --> 02:37:03,590
Could be just about anywhere.

1278
02:37:05,216 --> 02:37:07,469
I'll call you, okay?

1279
02:37:10,889 --> 02:37:13,558
- Bye.
- Bye.

1280
02:39:46,961 --> 02:39:51,007
He goin' back inside the trailer
or runnin' alongside it?

1281
02:40:00,684 --> 02:40:02,769
I just wanted to be here
when you left.

1282
02:40:06,856 --> 02:40:09,609
I don't want to leave you.

1283
02:40:09,651 --> 02:40:12,987
I don't want you to.

1284
02:40:13,071 --> 02:40:16,032
Just a few more days.

1285
02:40:18,034 --> 02:40:22,414
- And then?
- Oh.

1286
02:40:31,006 --> 02:40:33,383
Why did this happen?

1287
02:40:35,176 --> 02:40:39,264
I don't ask those questions, Annie.
And I didn't ask to love you, but I do.

1288
02:40:39,347 --> 02:40:41,558
Oh!

1289
02:40:41,641 --> 02:40:43,810
I'll always have that with me.

1290
02:40:47,731 --> 02:40:49,691
Tom.

1291
02:41:00,869 --> 02:41:05,123
Can we go for one last ride, hmm?

1292
02:41:07,792 --> 02:41:11,796
Yeah. I'll saddle 'em up.
