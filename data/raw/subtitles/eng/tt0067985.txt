I can find it.

it'll freshen up.

214

You know, you only get one shot
at a smart old boy like this.

what's this all about?

Ever come a thought to you
how you got this land so cheap?

249
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,054
- How do you know
we got it cheap?

250
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:49,422
- 'Cause a rock bottom price
paid by a greener's

251
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:51,224
is the only way to sell.

252
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:53,526
Nobody here in Wyoming
would touch it.

253
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,561
- How come is that?

254
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:57,230
- How come is lack of water.

255
00:14:57,264 --> 00:15:00,467
- Water? There's water
running all over this place.

256
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,636
- That's ditch water, boy,
'cause your place is on a ditch.

257
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,573
It's a difference
between a crick and a ditch.

Come on. I'll show ya.

259

Now that Ridge over there
on the left,

263
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:23,256

your water comes from.

Why him controlling the water
is the reason this here land

269
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,068
has stood empty
since the war.

270
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:36,603
- Well, it's not empty now.

271
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:38,138
- It will be come summer

272
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:40,240
when there ain't
no more runoff from the snow.

273
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,374
- Well, I've got
a legal right

274
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,743
to all the water above
the four-foot Mark on his dam.

275
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,178
It says so in my deed.

276
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:46,613
- Always been in the deed.

277
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,581
Only water comes down
is what little spills over

278
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,985
during the spring thaw.

279
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,521
- Well, Mr. Thompson,
I thank you for your concern,

280
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:56,589

Mr. Cross and I
will have a little talk.

284
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,430

our work cut out for US, huh?

306
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:19,672
- Could be.

307
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:22,442
Oh, Virgil,

308
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,777
let's not say anything
about this to your mother, huh?

309
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:28,348
- Well, like Thompson said,
it was for the Tanner men.

- You figure?

00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,145
- No, I don't.

319
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:00,213

catch US a deer.

01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:34,531
- I was getting US
our water back.

1053
01:05:42,706 --> 01:05:43,773
- Here. Stand still.

1054
01:05:43,807 --> 01:05:46,943
Let me tie up that bleeding
for you, run clear dry.

1055
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:15,105
- Mom, come quick!
Dad and virg is coming!

1056
01:06:15,139 --> 01:06:16,040
Something wrong's, mom.

1057
01:06:16,073 --> 01:06:19,043
Mr. Thompson and two dog
are bringing him.

1058
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,450
- James!
- I'm sorry, mom.

1059
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:27,717
- What are you sorry about?
What happened?

1060
01:06:27,751 --> 01:06:30,054
- Virgil, get me down from here.
- Dad, you better stay up there.

1061
01:06:30,087 --> 01:06:31,188
- He was shot
in the leg, ma'am.

1062
01:06:31,221 --> 01:06:33,123
You just stay up there
till we get down to the soddy.

1063
01:06:33,157 --> 01:06:34,391
- Who shot you, dad?
- It's all right, Kate.

1064
01:06:34,424 --> 01:06:36,493
- Ain't all that bad, ma'am.
Bullet went clean through.

1065
01:06:36,526 --> 01:06:37,327
- Clean through?

1066
01:06:37,361 --> 01:06:38,662
- It looks a lot worse
than it is.

1067
01:06:38,695 --> 01:06:40,164
- He ain't even felt pain yet.
[Laughs]

1068
01:06:40,197 --> 01:06:41,798
Two dog will have him fixed up
in no time.

1069
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:44,134
Lordy, the bullets
he's dug out of me,

1070
01:06:44,168 --> 01:06:45,802
the lead alone would've sunk
the monitor.

1071
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:47,371
- Mr. Thompson, please.

1072
01:06:47,404 --> 01:06:49,306
Let's get him down off here.
I'll get the bed ready.

1073
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:51,808
- Table's a better place
to work on him, ma'am.

1074
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,243
- Virgil,
you go get some water.

1075
01:06:53,277 --> 01:06:54,578
Andrew, you help him.
Here, I'll take this.

1076
01:06:54,611 --> 01:06:56,480
- Right here. All right,
come on down here now.

1077
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:57,714
Just put your weight on me.

1078
01:06:57,747 --> 01:07:01,285
All right, there.
There you go.

1079
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:09,726
- Is he hurt bad?
- Afraid he is.

1080
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:13,530
- If you would've hitched up
the mule like dad said,

1081
01:07:13,563 --> 01:07:16,433
this wouldn't have happened.

1082
01:07:16,466 --> 01:07:19,669
- I know that.
Don't you think I know that?

1083
01:07:19,703 --> 01:07:21,671
- Virg.

1084
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:24,841
I had to tell him.

1085
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:27,744
I'm sorry,
but I had to tell him.

1086
01:07:31,215 --> 01:07:34,718
- You did right, Andy.

1087
01:07:34,751 --> 01:07:36,386
Now put the mule away.

1088
01:07:40,457 --> 01:07:43,793
- Come on, mule.

1089
01:07:43,827 --> 01:07:47,231
- Ease up there, mule.
Ease up there.

1090
01:08:07,151 --> 01:08:09,386
Whoa.

1091
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:11,721
- Hi, virg!
- Did you get the wood cut?

1092
01:08:11,755 --> 01:08:13,823
- No.
- Why not?

1093
01:08:13,857 --> 01:08:15,459
I told you mom needs it
for the stove.

1094
01:08:15,492 --> 01:08:17,227
- Look, ever since
dad got hurt,

1095
01:08:17,261 --> 01:08:18,762
you've been bossing me around
like you was the boss.

1096
01:08:18,795 --> 01:08:20,330
- Well,
I can't do everything.

1097
01:08:20,364 --> 01:08:21,765
Now I've been doing
all the hard work around here.

1098
01:08:21,798 --> 01:08:23,300
- You're not my boss!
- Wait a minute now.

1099
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:25,235
What's wrong?

1100
01:08:25,269 --> 01:08:26,570
- When I left here,
I told him to cut some wood

1101
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:27,904
and he hadn't--
- well, I told him not too.

1102
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:29,406
- Why?

1103
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:30,640
- Because he's too little
to handle that axe

1104
01:08:30,674 --> 01:08:32,108
and I don't want him
to hurt himself.

1105
01:08:32,142 --> 01:08:33,577
- Well, if he can't do
a simple little thing

1106
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:35,145
like cut some wood,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1107
01:08:35,179 --> 01:08:38,915
- Virgil!
- I'm sorry.

1108
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:41,618
- I see you got the water, son.
That's good work.

1109
01:08:41,651 --> 01:08:45,689
- Yes, sir! Lot of good
it's gonna do the crops.

1110
01:08:45,722 --> 01:08:47,524
- You didn't bring much.

1111
01:08:47,557 --> 01:08:49,426
- Well, it's the ruts
in the road!

1112
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:51,595
I spilled near as much
as I got!

1113
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:53,630
- Andrew!
- Mom, I was just trying--

1114
01:08:53,663 --> 01:08:55,599
- oh, I know. I know.
Just fill it again.

1115
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:58,835
Here. And be careful.

1116
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:00,470
Here.

1117
01:09:11,881 --> 01:09:13,483
Virgil.
- I know, mom.

1118
01:09:13,517 --> 01:09:14,684
I'll get the wood cut.

1119
01:09:14,718 --> 01:09:16,853
- Well, there's time enough
for that.

1120
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:20,557
- That's just it, there isn't
enough time to get it all done.

1121
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:22,559
- Virgil, I want to talk
to you.

1122
01:09:22,592 --> 01:09:26,530
- Mom, listen, I'm sorry
I yelled at everybody.

1123
01:09:26,563 --> 01:09:32,168
- I know. I know. I know.
- Well, then what is it?

1124
01:09:32,202 --> 01:09:33,503
- No one blames you
for what happened

1125
01:09:33,537 --> 01:09:36,640
to your dad, you know.

1126
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:37,641
- I almost got him killed.

1127
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:40,577
- Yes, and you almost
got yourself killed too.

1128
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:44,314
You realize what you did
was wrong, don't you?

1129
01:09:44,348 --> 01:09:46,516
- Yes, ma'am.

1130
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:50,487
- Well, your reason for doing it
was right.

1131
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:55,225
Do you understand that?

1132
01:09:55,259 --> 01:09:58,528
- I think so.

1133
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:11,275
- Virgil, what I'm trying to say
is it makes me real proud

1134
01:10:11,308 --> 01:10:13,843
to know that there are
two men now

1135
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:19,449
to take care of Andrew and me.

1136
01:10:19,483 --> 01:10:23,720
- We're gonna make it here,
aren't we, mom?

1137
01:10:23,753 --> 01:10:27,591
- [Laughs]

1138
01:10:43,907 --> 01:10:46,410
- Plucking chickens
is no fun, is it, Virgil?

1139
01:10:46,443 --> 01:10:48,778
- You can say that again.
How many eggs you get?

1140
01:10:48,812 --> 01:10:50,380
- Eight.

1141
01:10:50,414 --> 01:10:52,716
- Too bad we had to kill
this good laying hen.

1142
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:54,284
- Sure is.

1143
01:10:54,318 --> 01:10:55,819
- Soon as I'm able,
we'll go out deer hunting

1144
01:10:55,852 --> 01:10:58,622
and this time we'll get him.

1145
01:10:58,655 --> 01:11:00,056
But your mother will have
some dumplings

1146
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:02,258
to go with that tough
old bird.

1147
01:11:02,292 --> 01:11:03,827
That'll be mighty tasty.

1148
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,462
- Yes, sir.
It sure will be.

1149
01:11:05,495 --> 01:11:06,996
- Where's Andrew?
I haven't seen him since sunup.

1150
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:09,399
- Oh, he's off playing
with that hawk of his.

1151
01:11:09,433 --> 01:11:12,068
- You mean Ralph.
- Yeah, Ralph.

1152
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:14,771
- Ralph.
[Horse whinnies]

1153
01:11:17,674 --> 01:11:21,578
- Kate, have you got
enough flower

1154
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:23,279
for a few extra dumplings?

1155
01:11:23,313 --> 01:11:24,914
- Don't tell me that Thompson
is out there.

1156
01:11:24,948 --> 01:11:27,917
- Oh, no, but I've got
a whale of an appetite.

1157
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:30,454
- If I hear one more suggestion
from him about my cooking,

1158
01:11:30,487 --> 01:11:32,522
he's gonna have to find
another table to eat at.

1159
01:11:32,556 --> 01:11:35,359
- Dad. Mom, dad,
come here quick.

1160
01:11:37,694 --> 01:11:42,932
Look!

1161
01:11:42,966 --> 01:11:44,868
- It's coming
straight at US.

1162
01:11:44,901 --> 01:11:46,503
- Oh, my god.

1163
01:11:46,536 --> 01:11:48,605
- Virgil, let the animals
out of the barn.

1164
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:52,909
- All right, I'll get them.
[Cow lowing]

1165

- Ralph!

1166
01:12:07,023 --> 01:12:09,959

I'll get the cow!

[Wind blowing fiercely,
Jim shouting, animals bellowing]

1168
01:12:12,362 --> 01:12:15,031
- Where's Andrew?
- Virgil, where's your brother?

1169
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:16,966
- I don't know.
- We have to go find Andrew.

1170
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,637
- What do I do?
- Kate. Kate.

1171
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:24,741
Get in the root cellar.
Get down here.

[Mule brays]

1173
01:12:29,579 --> 01:12:32,482
Virgil, you check the house
and see if Andrew's there.

1174
01:12:32,516 --> 01:12:34,350
Go on!

1175
01:12:39,022 --> 01:12:43,660

- James,
where did you find Andrew?

1195

- Get the matches.
- Where are they?

- Look at that.

1220
01:19:18,922 --> 01:19:22,425
Looks worse than when we first
came here.

1221
01:19:58,461 --> 01:20:02,966
- We're going back
to Pennsylvania.

1222

- This isn't
what I came here for

1229
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:17,947
and I don't want
to discuss it.

1230
01:20:17,981 --> 01:20:19,448
- Fine.
Then you just listen.

1231
01:20:19,482 --> 01:20:23,987
- Listen to what?
More of your fancy dream talk?

1232
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:30,526
How much more has to happen

1233
01:20:30,559 --> 01:20:33,529
before you realize
we can't make it here?

1234
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:35,298

1239

and we have no prospects
for any.

1240

A whole spring's work
is gone.

1241
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:20,876
Your father has been shot
by that maniac.

1242

We're going back.

We're going back.

1248
01:21:52,075 --> 01:21:54,143

is there?

01:21:54,177 --> 01:21:56,579
- Yes, there is.

1250

There's lawns, and streets,
and churches,

- Kate, now you know
as well as I do

1253
01:22:08,591 --> 01:22:10,226

by going back.

01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:12,928
- I don't know that.

1255
01:22:12,962 --> 01:22:16,465
We can go back
and start over again.

1256
01:22:16,499 --> 01:22:19,168
That's what I'm going to do.

1257
01:22:19,202 --> 01:22:22,738
- I'm not.

1258
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:26,075
I'm not going back there.

1259
01:22:26,109 --> 01:22:30,579
If we leave now
and find it hard going again,

1260
01:22:30,613 --> 01:22:34,083
we'll move again--
and again if we have to.

1261
01:22:34,117 --> 01:22:39,255
Mom, when do we stop
starting over?

1262
01:22:39,288 --> 01:22:43,592
When do we say
"this is where we stay"?

1263
01:22:43,626 --> 01:22:49,132
When, mom?
- Virgil, that's enough.

1264
01:22:49,165 --> 01:22:53,202

Well, for the first time,

Sure hope not.

- Hey, virg, she can't.
The wagon's busted.

that's not gonna stop her.

gonna leave US.

01:37:32,447 --> 01:37:35,183
I could have the house
in order.

1389
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:42,157
Virgil can kill enough meat
to last.

1390
01:37:42,190 --> 01:37:46,494
Mr. Jensen will give US credit
at the store.

1391
01:37:46,528 --> 01:37:48,997
I'm not worried.

1392
01:37:49,031 --> 01:37:52,534
I know we can make it
through the winter.

1393
01:37:52,567 --> 01:37:56,204
And in the spring,
we'll plant a new crop.

1394
01:38:00,542 --> 01:38:02,377
- Kate, are you sure?

1395
01:38:06,248 --> 01:38:07,615
- I'm sure.

1396
01:38:14,722 --> 01:38:17,459
I'm sure for the boys...

1397
01:38:17,492 --> 01:38:20,428
And I'm sure for me...

1398
01:38:20,462 --> 01:38:25,533
Of what we can have here
because of you.

1399
01:38:25,567 --> 01:38:28,903
I'm sure because of you.

1400
01:38:42,584 --> 01:38:44,619
- Mom! Dad!

1401
01:38:44,652 --> 01:38:46,554
My Ralph's come back!

1402
01:38:46,588 --> 01:38:49,391
Things are kind of busted up,
Ralph.

1403
01:38:49,424 --> 01:38:50,725
We'll get them fixed up

1404
01:38:50,758 --> 01:38:54,229
and you'll have a brand-new
barn to sleep in.

1405
01:38:54,262 --> 01:38:55,263
- Where'd you find him,
Andy?

1406
01:38:55,297 --> 01:38:57,265
- Over there in the Meadow
drinking some water

1407
01:38:57,299 --> 01:38:59,001
out of the ditch.

1408
01:38:59,034 --> 01:39:00,435
You were right, mom.

1409
01:39:00,468 --> 01:39:03,238
Ralph's mother brought her back
just like you said.

1410
01:39:03,271 --> 01:39:05,974
- Did you tell him that?
- Yes, I did.

1411
01:39:06,008 --> 01:39:07,609
- How'd you know so much
about horses?

1412
01:39:07,642 --> 01:39:10,245
- Well, I guess I just know
about mothers.

1413
01:39:10,278 --> 01:39:13,081
- Mrs. Tanner, seeing as how
this man of yours is gonna live,

1414
01:39:13,115 --> 01:39:15,483
why don't you folks come in
and get it while it's hot.

1415
01:39:15,517 --> 01:39:16,418
- Get what?

1416
01:39:16,451 --> 01:39:18,353
- Now--now just hold
on there, ma'am.

1417
01:39:18,386 --> 01:39:20,422
If you folks are gonna settle
down here like you say you are,

1418
01:39:20,455 --> 01:39:22,490
there's a few things
I ought to be passing on to you.

1419
01:39:22,524 --> 01:39:25,093
- Like what?
- Some of my cooking tips.

1420
01:39:25,127 --> 01:39:28,330
For example, I'll bet
you fry your eggs

1421
01:39:28,363 --> 01:39:30,332
in plain old grease.

1422
01:39:30,365 --> 01:39:32,634
- Well, bacon grease.

1423
01:39:32,667 --> 01:39:34,502
- Eh. Did you ever think
of adding just a smidgeon

1424
01:39:34,536 --> 01:39:36,371
of bear fat?

1425
01:39:36,404 --> 01:39:37,639
- Bear fat?

1426
01:39:37,672 --> 01:39:39,607
- See, I can tell by the way
you're all goggley-eyed there

1427
01:39:39,641 --> 01:39:40,808
you never use bear fat.

1428
01:39:40,842 --> 01:39:43,045
Put a little bear fat in there,
it don't taste so greasy.

1429
01:39:43,078 --> 01:39:44,212
- Virgil.
- Virgil, come on in here.

1430
01:39:44,246 --> 01:39:45,313
- Now listen up.

1431
01:39:45,347 --> 01:39:47,382
I'll thank you for leaving
my kitchen this minute.

1432
01:39:47,415 --> 01:39:48,550
- I wanted to talk to you
about this coffee

1433
01:39:48,583 --> 01:39:49,384
you've been making.

1434
01:39:49,417 --> 01:39:51,553
- My coffee?
What about my coffee?

1435
01:39:51,586 --> 01:39:55,623
Mr. Thompson, if you don't like
my coffee...

1436
01:39:55,657 --> 01:40:00,328
- Come on, Ralph.
Don't be sore at me.

1437
01:40:00,362 --> 01:40:04,166
That whole storm
wasn't my fault.

1438
01:40:04,199 --> 01:40:06,468
Come on, now.
Quit fighting.

1439
01:40:06,501 --> 01:40:07,702
You better make up

1440
01:40:07,735 --> 01:40:12,374
'cause we're gonna be here
for a long time.
