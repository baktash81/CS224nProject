1
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:12,179
(Marshal) 'Gentlemen,
start your engines.'

2
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:14,556
(Engines rev)

3
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,463
(Grunts)

4
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:35,674
(Argument deafened by revving)

5
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,620
I still owe you one!

6
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,592
(Diana) God, are you alright?

7
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,386
(Jamie) What happened?
Are you OK, honey?

8
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,679
(Dan) Yeah, I'm OK.

9
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:23,889
(Mumbles)

10
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,265
What's with him?

11
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,892
(Bill) Don't ask. He'll be alright.

12
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:30,103
Well, he's better! I've been waiting
half my life for this trip.

13
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,148
If you back out now, you can spend
your vacation on your back

14
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,109
in the hospital
with your head in a sling!

15
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,402
And that goes for you too.

16
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,696
I promise you I'll have him
on the highway tomorrow.

17
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,156
That's a promise.

18
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,158
Oh, God, promises,
promises, promises.

19
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,119
You better have him on the highway
cos you got him in this!

20
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,666
(Sighs)

21
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,211
He wouldn't back out now.

22
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:58,256
- Would he?
- Nah.

23
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,555
Oh, brother!

24
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,068
Jamie? Jamie, honey?

25
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:21,530
Listen, I got a million things I gotta do.
Couldn't you do this by yourself?

26
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,449
Come on, where's your spirit?

27
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:34,292
If the guns my great-granddaddy buried
are worth anything, this man'

 know it.

28
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,836
Frankly, I don't believe you.

29
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,796
Oh, don't be such a skeptic!

30
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:48,306
Oh, this one looks like it.
Great-granddaddy had pictures of them.

31
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,226
Yeah, no doubt about it.
That's a Confederate musket.

32
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,478
- How do you know?
- It says so right on the ticket here.

33
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:57,899
"US Springfield, 1863,
used by...

34
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,944
"...used by the Union Forces."

35
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,157
Now I know
why he liked them so much.

36
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,034
They're beautiful.

37
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,956
Lucky for us he buried them
and gave me the map.

38
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,583
How are you folks today?

39
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,836
- Oh, hi. Fine, thank you. Fine.
- (Jamie clears throat)

40
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,548
- Can I help you?
- We're interested in muskets.

41
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,174
Any particular kind?

42
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,552
A Confederate, of course.

43
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:29,347
But what kind? Y'all know
we had several during the conflict.

44
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,976
Don't ask me, she's the expert.

45
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:36,021
I think it's like that one there.

46
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:39,733
Now that's the Cadillac.

47
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,652
Most of the guns were made
in France or England,

48
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,779
brought in by gun merchants.

49
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,074
But this one has got
the authentic CSA stamp on it.

50
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,451
What's that?

51
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,161
CSA, Miss Expert.

52
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:54,956
GSA?
Confederate States of America?

53
00:06:56,416 --> 00:07:00,712
Right. Er... well, this must be the one.
How much is it?

54
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:04,174
It depends on whether
you're buying or selling.

55
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:07,719
Actually, we're looking for them.

56
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,847
See, my great-granddaddy buried them
and he gave me the map,

57
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,307
so we're going off to find them.

58
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:16,269
That's right, er...
we're going off to find them, alright.

59
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,604
- Shh!
- Shh.

60
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:22,359
Well, this was in perfect condition
and I'm asking two thousand dollars for it.

61
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:27,697
Two thousand dollars?

62
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:32,994
200 times two, that's...

63
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,455
(Both) 400 thousand dollars.

64
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,999
Will you be quiet?

65
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:42,796
Excuse me, sir, what if they weren't
in what you call mint condition?

66
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,006
I'll give you a thousand dollars
apiece for 'em,

67
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,550
as long as they have
the CSA stamp on 'em.

68
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:50,512
- Woo-whee!
- I told you.

69
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,390
We haven't got 'em yet.
I mean, this is a catalogue price.

70
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,684
I saw the dollar signs in your eyes.

71
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,811
Yeah, that was your reflection.

72
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,562
- Thanks.
- Wait.

73
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,564
Where did y'all say
you were gonna find 'em'?

74
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,942
I didn't.

75
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,069
(I Country music instrumental)

76
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,458
(Yawning)

77
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,295
- Hey, Bill?
- Yeah?

78
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:28,967
If you're tired, just whistle.
It'll help keep you awake.

79
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,720
Will you get
your feet off me, please?

80
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,390
Jamie?

81
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,559
James?

82
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,144
Billy?

83
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,647
- Did, er... your uncle, er...
- My granddaddy?

84
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:46,651
Yeah, well, whatever. Did he ever tell you
why they call it Whiskey Mountain?

85
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,195
(Jamie) Well, as legend has it,

86
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,406
besides the $200,000 worth of muskets,

87
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,994
the regiment also hid
25 barrels of whiskey.

88
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,954
They said for medical purposes.

89
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,789
(Bill) For real?

90
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,666

I bet these people will know
where it is.

117
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,917
Anyway, I'll do the talking.

118
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:59,219
Old Jim lets them dogs chew on 'em

119
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:03,139
And him and Wayne, they hog-tied him
and jerked him up so hard,

120
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:08,937
they flipped him over the limb
and knocked them all out.

121
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,814
Oh, Dan, look at this.
Oh, I love it.

122
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,650
Come on, you... listen, come on.

123
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,444
Oh, a vacation, isn't it?

124
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,570
Yeah, vacation...

125
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,447
Hey, look.

126
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,700

underarm vacuum cleaners?

127
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:23,826
Get out!

128
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,329
Psst. ..

129
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,470
Bill, will you go ask these people
about the place?

130
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,347
- Nope.
- Why?

131
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:30,643
You said you wanted to do the talkin‘.
Get on down there and talk.

132
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,773
You turkey!

133
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,155
Excuse me. Howdy.

134
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,408
I was wondering
if I could get some directions from you.

135
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,618
Maybe.

136
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,330
Hey, Jamie, what was the name
of that graveyard?

137
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:51,539
Graveyard?

138
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,751
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Bill Thompson from Powsell County.

139
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:58,880
This is my good friend and pastor
Reverend Ogney.

140
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,840
And the good reverend and I
and his missus

141
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:05,720
are down here looking for
a missing link, er... to the family tree.

142
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:10,600
So any cooperation you can give us
would be most appreciated.

143
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,477
Reverend?

144
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:13,895
Are you a preacher?

145
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,272
No, not really.
What we're looking for is, er...

146
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,859
my wife's grandad, well,
her great-grandads stomping grounds.

147
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,402
Hmm.

148
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,696
What is it you're looking for?

149
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,990
It's an old Confederate graveyard,

150
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,202
it's supposed to be
just a few miles out of town.

151
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:35,416
- I don't know.
- It's on the way to Whiskey Mountain.

152
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,547
You know, in the summer,
tourists ask about that place all the time.

153
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,592
Everybody knows it doesn't exist.

154
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:48,054
Well, it just ain't real.

155
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,723
You've come up kinda late.
It's getting a little nippy.

156
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,350
Hey, you!

157
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,147
She's cute as a dog, ain't she?

158
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,195
(Jack) Hi, blue eyes.

159
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,615
Where you going,
you sweet thing, you?

160
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,575
(Men cackling)

161
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,208
I don't believe it.

162
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,419
What are you doing, leaving me
out there alone in the car?

163
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,046
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you?

164
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,591
- Who are those men?
- What men?

165
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,803
Those weirdos out there
who were trying to grab me.

166
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:53,077
You know, it was just... probably
a couple of wise guys hitting on her.

167
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,371
Probably. Let's go lighten her up.

168
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,914
Yeah.

169
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,879
There's no one there, Diana.

170
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,339
What do you mean,
there's nobody there?

171
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,300
Go on and look for yourself.

172
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,270
They're gone. Let's go.

173
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,902
Diana, come on.

174
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,834
Listen, er... thank you very much.

175
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,545
You ain't takin‘ those cycles
up those hills, are you?

176
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,006
Oh, yeah, that's alright.
They're dirt bikes.

177
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,716
I wouldn't do that, if I was you.

178
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,094
Some of them mountain folk
don't take to strangers.

179
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,638
Right.

180
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,475
It's like them ones hangin‘ around
your wife out there.

181
00:16:58,601 --> 00:16:59,852
Why, that dirty...

182
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,106
That son of a...

183
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,453
Well...

184
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,420
(Diana) God, those people are spooky.

185
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,549
Do you really think
there's a Whiskey Mountain?

186
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:32,260
(Bill) I think they were trying to put us off,
right, Reverend?

187
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,720
(Dan) "Right, Reverend?"
You turkey!

188
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,431
- Now, why would they do that?
- (Jamie) I don't know,

189
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,810
but my great-granddaddy
wouldn't be wrong about a mountain.

190
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:42,770
(Diana) Oh, Jamie, that map's ancient.

191
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:47,900
(Jamie) No, it isn't. He drew it
15 years ago, just before he died.

192
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,658
(Men laughing)

193
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,370
(Bill) Look at the falls over the road.

194
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:03,499
(Jamie) That's gotta be the falls
on the map.

195
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:04,959
(Dan) Oh, one for Jamie.

196
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,379
(Jamie giggles) Na-na-na, na-na, na!

197
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,131
(I Harmonica playing)

198
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,168
(Gargles)

199
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,856
- How's the leg?
- Oh, terrific.

200
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,233
She's tough as nails.

201
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,695
You know, it's too bad
it didn't fall on your head, Diana.

202
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,573
- Huh?
- It would've hurt less.

203
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,793
- You OK?
- Uh-huh.

204
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,336
Sure?

205
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:44,642
- (Bird call)
- What the hell was that?

206
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,853
I don't know about you,
but I'm getting jumpy.

207
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:51,232
- Hey, it was Odin.
- Odin?

208
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,858
The love god of the mountain.

209
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,986
I told you we wouldn't need
two sleeping bags, darling.

210
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:02,618
Oh, tell a man anything,
and he interprets it as he's irresistible.

211
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,835
With another drink, an animal
in the forest is gonna save you.

212
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,631
(Diana moaning)

213
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,885
In fact... that's a good idea.

214
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,269
(Whistles)

215
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,648
Oh, no.

216
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,275
Maybe just a tad.

217
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,655
Oh, no, Dan. One more drink and
he'll sleep for the next three days.

218
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,116
I don't know about you all,
but I'm going to bed.

219
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,077
- Ah, boo.
- Boo!

220
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,332
I'll finish it.

221
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:54,211
(Bird calls continue)

222
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,339
Here's looking up your adenoids, pal.

223
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,341
And you, baby.

224
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:00,968
(Dan) Will you do me a favor?

225
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,929
Why do women always have
to drink your beer?

226
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:07,308
- (Bill) They do it for my own good.
- (Dan) They do it for your own good?

227
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:10,436
Why don't they know
about their stomachs?

228
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:13,856
Guess who'll feel better
in the morning?

229
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,691
(Sighs)

230
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,402
Well, I think she's got the right idea.

231
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:21,906
Mighty-night.

232
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:28,245
(Dan) I'm just gonna sit up here
and look at these trees.

233
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,623
(indistinct chatter)

234
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,833
(Giggling)

235
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,045
(indistinct chatter)

236
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:42,092
(Chatter continues)

237
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:40,359
Diana! Dan, get up! Fire!

238
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,319
(Dan) What?

239
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,948
Get the bikes!
Get the bikes to the water.

240
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:49,910
- Hey, get that bike. Get it!
- Come on! Diana, hurry up!

241
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,999
Come on, Dan.
Get back for the other bike.

242
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:02,506
Come on, Diana. Push. Push!

243
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,467
(Dan) Goddamn it, that's hot!

244
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,616
The bags, the bags!

245
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:53,807
(Jamie) The map! Don't lose it!
My bag, the map is in my bag.

246
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:57,394
- I'll get it, I'll get it.
- Bill, no!

247
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:03,359
(Diana) Wait, Bill, no!

248
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,571
Alright?

249
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,240
- How the hell did that start?
- Who cares?

250
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:15,287
- I wonder how it did start.
- (Jamie) Maybe the campfire.

251
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:20,000
- The campfire was the last to burn.
- That's right.

252
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:28,634
Er... whose idea was
this vacation anyhow?

253
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:48,487
- Hey, listen.
- What?

254
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,365
- What do you think?
- Huh?

255
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:56,036
Well, that mountain's still
got my curiosity going.

256
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,414
I'm game.

257
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,499
Oh, shit...

258
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,626
Here we go again.

259
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:19,078
Wow, this is it!
Will you look at those falls?

260
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,540
ls that incredible or what?
Check that!

261
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,337
- I'll build a fire.
- I'll help.

262
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:37,012
Bill?

263
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,101
Shit!

264
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,186
(Dan) Hey, I'll tell you what?

265
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:31,400
Why don't you two go on down and
get cleaned up and we'll fix up camp?

266
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,443
(Hooting)

267
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:29,583
(Hooting continues)

268
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,799
- Bill?
- Hmm? Mm-mm.

269
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:40,510
- Honey, do you have my panties?
- Mm-hmm.

270
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,638
Come on, let me have them.

271
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:46,600
I don't have your panties.

272
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,896
You don't have my panties?
Then who took them?

273
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:53,023
Not me.

274
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,651
Alright, come on, now.
Who's the wise guy, who took my panties?

275
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:58,737
Come on, Diana!
Hey, don't look at me, I didn't take 'em.

276
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:02,074
(Jamie) That's right,
so what could've happened to them?

277
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,283
(Dan) Come on, you two.

278
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,911
Tell you what, why don't we get up,
put some coffee on,

279
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:09,289
and if you don't have anything to wear,
I'll loan you my jockey shorts.

280
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,503
(Giggling)

281
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:00,043
(Water falling)

282
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,003
(Grunts)

283
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,258
You alright?

284
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:07,968
I'm fine, thanks.

285
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:31,324
Oh, my God!

286
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:33,952
Hmm...

287
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:37,289
Well, we sure aren't gonna be able
to wade across this.

288
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:42,335
I'm not so sure.
Why don't you wade out there and check?

289
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,713
Why don't you suck a rose?

290
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,724
It'll work, it's just gonna take
a couple of trips, that's all.

291
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:05,567
I hope my life insurance is up to date,
cos I can't swim!

292
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,444
It is.

293
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,947
(Dan) I don't like it.

294
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:14,075
Come on, come on.

295
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:47,067
That's good.

296
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,953
A little swirly, isn't it?

297
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,458
- Do me a favor, Diana.
- What?

298
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,418
Lighten up.

299
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:10,006
Bill... you know as well as I know,

300
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:13,009
that we shouldve turned back
a long time ago.

301
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,638
- You're right.
- Screw you, I don't wanna be right!

302
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,765
Then give me a kiss.

303
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:25,647
You're so mucho macho.

304
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,987
- I love you.
- I know you do.

305
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:44,082
Well, if this whatever vacation
is making you happy...

306
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,543
- I guess I'll lighten up.
- Good.

307
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,608
Wait. Wait a minute.
Bill?

308
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:54,694
Your helmet. Put your helmet on!

309
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,279
Your helmet!

310
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,764
Bill, will you pull?

311
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:23,932
Please!

312
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,659
Hey, what happened?

313
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,786
Something's wrong with the rope.

314
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,038
See if you can ride it out!

315
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,383
Oh, my...

316
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,613
(Diana) Bill!

317
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,408
Bill!

318
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:27,829
- Diana!
- Oh, my God, she can't swim.

319
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,857
- Give me your hand.
- Help!

320
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:59,152
Give me your hand!
Easy, easy, easy... Easy!

321
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,905
OK, OK, you're alright.
You're alright.

322
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:04,616
Easy, easy.

323
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,788
Alright?

324
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,975
You know, you're right.

325
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,352
We set outta here tomorrow.

326
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:16,729
Yeah.

327
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,983
In the meantime...

328
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,361
...
 think I'm gonna stay awake tonight.

329
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,833
(Bill) Anybody home?

330
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,836
(Dan) Hello?

331
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:12,887
Hello?

332
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:30,905
Looks like someone's living here.

333
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,532
Sure.

334
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,793
I'm gonna go upstairs.

335
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:56,180
What the hell's wrong with you?

336
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,807
Hey, who are you?

337
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:00,810
Let's get him downstairs.
Come on.

338
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:12,071
- He's got Diana's panties.
- What?

339
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:16,367
Let me see...
Let me see what you got there.

340
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,578
- When did you get these?
- I knew it!

341
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:28,546
Listen to me,
I know you can talk.

342
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,840
Have you been following us?

343
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:38,097
Jesus! He couldn't be
the whole answer, could he?

344
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,308
I don't know, he could be.

345
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:42,727
Do you live here? Do you live here?

346
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,441
Let's get outta here,
this is the worse yet.

347
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,650
(Jamie) I'm ready.

348
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,534
Have you seen the ocean?

349
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,829
What?

350
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,707
The ocean. The ocean!

351
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:10,588
What about it?

352
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,215
How big is it?

353
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,843
(Bill) It's, er... bigger
than all these mountains.

354
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,136
Why?

355
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:24,352
Fish.

356
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,523
You will need fish.

357
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,776
- Dan, let's go.
- Wait, wait.

358
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:34,654
(Diana) Bill, let's go.

359
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:39,534
You might just be too crazy
to be dangerous.

360
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:43,037
It'll be a roof over our heads.

361
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:45,748
Friend?

362
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,291
Hmm?

363
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,127
Friend.

364
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:52,255
You wanna show us
where those fish are?

365
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,382
Friends.

366
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,964
Oh, wow!

367
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,508
- Trout?
- Trout.

368
00:45:58,089 --> 00:45:59,924
Hey, old man, you ever heard
of a Whiskey Mountain?

369
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,513
Whiskey Mountain...

370
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:29,662
Whiskey Mountain!

371
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:41,150
(Dan) Well, what do you think?
ls that it?

372
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,277
(Jamie) I'm gonna check.

373
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:48,532
(Dan) We can leave the bikes here
and we can take a look.

374
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:51,410
According to the map, that's it.

375
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,120
Ha!

376
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:57,375
- (Diana) Can I look at the map?
- (Jamie) No!

377
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,667
Let's check it out.

378
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:00,961
(Bill) Let's check it out.

379
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:04,090
(Diana) Let's go.

380
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:05,549
- You're off?
- Yeah.

381
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:08,177
(Dan) Don't dump your bike.

382
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,774
There should be someone around here.

383
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,150
(Bill) Yeah, looks like it.

384
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:26,112
(Dan) Oh, a hound dog?

385
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:28,239
(Jamie) Hello?

386
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:32,785
(Dan) What the hell's he eating?

387
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,582
Oh, wow!

388
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,877
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

389
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:47,133
(Bill) Pretty good.

390
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,346
(Dan) Goddamn, in 20 years
you ain't lost your aim once!

391
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,723
Hey, girls, come on, let's go.

392
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:04,608
There's nothing up there,
it's all locked up.

393
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,902
The tunnel is just
at the other end of this lake.

394
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:11,240
Well, Bill suggested we leave the bikes
here and go on up and take a look.

395
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,784
- Good idea.
- (Dan) OK. Let's go.

396
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:17,580
Hey, boy. Hey, boy.

397
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:20,332
- (Diana) Shall we take him?
- (Bill) Nah.

398
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:21,959
Oh...

399
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:37,725
That tunnel will be hard to find
once we reach the ravine, so let's go.

400
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:51,822
(indistinct chatter)

401
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,678
This is it!

402
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:17,056
I think I feel better now.

403
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:19,808
Oh, and a whole lot richer too!

404
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:21,727
- So rich!
- Let's go!

405
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,020
- (Bill) Whoa, whoa...
- (Dan) Wait, wait.

406
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,397
- What? Come on.
- We don't know what's in there.

407
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:26,607
So why can't we go and...

408
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:27,816
- Diana?
- What?

409
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:30,236
If something happens to us inside,
it'd be nice to know

410
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:32,613
that there are two people outside
that can go for help.

411
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:35,491
And besides that, there's bats.

412
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:37,868
Right. Hurry back!

413
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:40,663
That's it, let's go!

414
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:49,046
Break a leg, guys!

415
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:51,757
Break a leg? If I didn't love her,
I'd break her neck!

416
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:54,635
Anything that looks like a gun?

417
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:59,431
- (Dan) Damn it, it's dark in there.
- (Bill) It sure is.

418
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:01,976
- Why didn't you bring a light?
- Me? Why didn't you?

419
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:04,144
- I forgot!
- Oh, right.

420
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,272
No bats coming out.

421
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:08,566
- Er...
- (Jamie) Talk to us!

422
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:10,901
It's leaking out of the ceiling.

423
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:13,320
You alright?

424
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,953
- Man, it smells like shit in here.
- This shit?

425
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,497
- What?
- It's marijuana.

426
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:26,125
Holy shit!

427
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:29,044
What. . .?

428
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,255
(Rudy) Move and you're dead.

429
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,259
(Dan) Where are you?
We can't see you.

430
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:37,886
(Rudy) You guys never learn.

431
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:41,765
I mean it, hero.
You'll be dead before you know it.

432
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,643
So just move out
the way you came in.

433
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,520
Slowly.

434
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:14,548
Oh, God!

435
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,051
(Rudy) Shut up.

436
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:22,348
That's some change into a dope dealer.

437
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:24,808
Alright, let's get 'em up
to the cabin.

438
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:27,603
Yeah, even his voice has changed.

439
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:29,396
Why are you doing this?
We wouldn't have done anything.

440
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:33,859
Because I got a million dollars of primo
headed for the city,

441
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:37,738
and I can't have you jerks out there
advertising it.

442
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:40,366
Advertising it? Are you kidding?

443
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:42,326
We're not gonna tell anyone.

444
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:44,953
I mean, I'll smoke a kilo
right here on this spot.

445
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:47,247
Yeah, I bet you will.

446
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:52,795
You know, for two days
we tried to scare you all off.

447
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,422
Y'all just kept comin‘ and comin‘.

448
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:59,760
You just wouldn't stop.

449
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:02,638
Just call them plain stupid, Mr. Rudy.

450
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:07,768
They're dumb, not stupid. Dumb!

451
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:14,191
You jeopardized our whole operation,
you dumb idiots.

452
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:19,738
Alright, tie 'em up. Don't waste
any more time on these morons.

453
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:23,534
Hey, mister, we're just looking
for muskets.

454
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,371
Muskets?

455
00:53:28,664 --> 00:53:33,335
My granddaddy buried them
and his map lead us to this cave.

456
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:39,717
Why the hell didn't you tell me that
at the store?

457
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:44,138
Now, I got no choice.

458
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,893
(Men laughing)

459
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:52,271
(Jack) She's the prettiest little thing
you ever saw.

460
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:55,983
(Bowzer) You be right.

461
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:59,945
(Jack) Oh, blonde hair and blue eyes...

462
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:03,323
(Homer) What if her collars
match her cuff?

463
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:05,701
(Men continue laughing)

464
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:12,374
(Jack) Hi, honey. I think I love you.

465
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:16,837
Oh, come on, you said that
to Maryanne last week!

466
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:30,684
(Thunderclap)

467
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,313
(Jack) Hi, honey.

468
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,613
Stop it!

469
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:44,364
Leave her alone, damn it!

470
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:47,075
Oh, why don't you shut your trap?

471
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:53,665
We like a pretty woman as much
as anybody else does, don't we?

472
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:55,834
You better believe, you better believe.

473
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:59,797
Why don't you untie my hands
and say that to me?

474
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:02,591
Steady on, steady on!

475
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:06,053
Don't you remember
what brother Rudy said?

476
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:08,514
We don't bide these folks.

477
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:10,474
He better not call me that again.

478
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:14,019
Why don't you untie my hands
and I'll kick your creepin‘ ass?

479
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:17,689
Hey! Damn it!

480
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:18,982
Goddamn it! Get away!

481
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,993
(Shouts overlap)

482
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:40,045
- Dan!
- You piece of slime! Get off!

483
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:47,427
(Shouting continues)

484
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:57,521
(Thunderclap)

485
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:01,525
You had your fun?

486
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,445
Jack? Jack!

487
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:19,960
You know, you can't blame me, Mr. Rudy,
I didn't start that.

488
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,087
Oh, I know, I know.

489
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:26,800
Now, you take these two
up to the tunnel,

490
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:30,679
then you dig some graves
over on the other side of the mountain.

491
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:34,433
No way! I'm gonna stay here
and have some fun.

492
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:36,184
Homer?

493
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:38,312
I'm talking to you!

494
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:42,900
Now... up to the tunnel, right?

495
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:44,359
Now.

496
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:48,906
I gotta run down the road
and see some buyers.

497
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:50,866
OK, Mr. Rudy.

498
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:01,043
Sure do look good, don't they?

499
00:57:03,712 --> 00:57:05,547
ls he gone yet?

500
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:13,221
He's gone. That means he won't be
back for a couple of hours.

501
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:16,308
Why don't we just get
that Polaroid out

502
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,435
and take us some Polaroid pictures?

503
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,603
Yeah, the Polaroid.

504
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:26,610
Tell you what, Bowzer,
you take real nice care of those ladies,

505
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:29,529
cos we wanna 'em to look real good
on the Polaroid.

506
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:32,407
No worries, Homer.
I'll take good care of 'em till you get back.

507
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:36,662
We'll be back soon,
just takin‘ these down the tunnel.

508
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:47,089
Oh, boy! Real nice pic.

509
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:48,882
Keep going, buddy, keep going.

510
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:51,510
(Jamie and Diana screaming)

511
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,726
Bowzer, I never would've thought...

512
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:03,188
(Men laughing)

513
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:11,780
(Homer) That's gotta be dandy,
dandy, dandy...

514
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:21,915
(Men continue laughing)

515
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:36,513
(Jamie and Diana continue screaming)

516
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:52,362
(Homer) Damn nice!

517
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:59,786
(indistinct commenting continues)

518
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:03,540
(Homer) Oh, that's nice.
That's good.

519
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,128
(Women continue screaming)

520
00:59:13,008 --> 00:59:16,261
(Homer) Oh, look at that woman!

521
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:20,390
We're gonna have a lot of pictures
on the wall!

522
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:23,018
(Screaming continues)

523
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:31,443
(Snoring)

524
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:16,279
Get your asses up!

525
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:17,906
Up!

526
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:23,537
(Diana whimpering)

527
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:26,456
We got a fortune in grass
out there to protect,

528
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:28,083
and you guys are on a pleasure trip.

529
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:30,293
Well... I told 'em you'd be mad,
Mr. Rudy.

530
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,504
You told 'em shit.
Now get out there, you and Jack,

531
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,506
and get out
and dig those graves.

532
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:38,802
NOW!

533
01:00:38,927 --> 01:00:41,721
Bowzer, you stay here
and help me keep an eye on these two.

534
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:46,685
And tell Charlie and Luke to get down here
outta the fields, I need them!

535
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:49,980
(Whimpering) Please, don't!

536
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:05,036
Put your clothes on.

537
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,048
Jamie?

538
01:01:18,842 --> 01:01:20,260
Jamie?

539
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:24,264
Oh, God!

540
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,518
Jamie...

541
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,729
Jamie.

542
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:32,272
Jamie.

543
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:36,902
Jamie?

544
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:40,530
It's alright, Jamie.

545
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,206
Oh, I love it.

546
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:53,251
Vroom, vroom!

547
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,378
- You like that, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

548
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:58,757
Well, for a first thing, you got
the hat on backwards, you dummy.

549
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:00,467
You turn it around.

550
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:05,764
OK. That's cos when you hit a tree,
you won't split that stupid skull of yours.

551
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:08,558
Now, that's just like a stick shift,
you understand, Jack?

552
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:11,102
See, you have to turn the key on,
that's what makes it go.

553
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:13,730
Then right over here,
that there is the clutch,

554
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:15,565
so you gotta understand
that's what you pull first.

555
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:19,110
Then that there, down there,
see that little pedal down there...

556
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:21,071
Stick your foot on it.
No, no, that's your foot rest.

557
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:23,615
Put your toe under there.
Under there, now that's it.

558
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:26,326
That's the way you do it.
Now over there, that's the brake.

559
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:28,453
That's for the back.
That little one, that's right.

560
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:32,332
This here, you know what this here is?
That's for the front wheel.

561
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:35,377
You hit that without hitting the back one,
you gonna end up in that tree.

562
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:37,921
- How do you start it?
- See that big old thing stickin‘ out there?

563
01:02:38,046 --> 01:02:39,214
- Yeah.
- Just stomp on it.

564
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:40,840
Vroom! I'm gonna go!

565
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:43,134
(Whooping)

566
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:13,248
(Rudy) Hey, Homer!

567
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:15,875
Come back here with those bikes
and do what I told ya!

568
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:26,469
Whoo!

569
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:29,097
(Water falling)

570
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:30,223
- Damn!
- What?

571
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:31,975
Someone's coming.

572
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,935
- You have anything loose?
- Nothing.

573
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,228
It's the old man.

574
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:38,940
Hey, Old Man, remember us?
Fish? Fish?

575
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:40,483
- Fish.
- Yeah.

576
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:44,654
Cut us loose.

577
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:46,906
- Yeah, cut it.
- The ropes.

578
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:53,204
Cut.

579
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:57,250
Cut...

580
01:04:00,879 --> 01:04:02,547
- He might...
- Easy.

581
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,424
- Get that thing away from me.
- Come on, now.

582
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:14,851
- Come on. Come on!
- Easy.

583
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:17,812
Uh-uh. We're friends.

584
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:19,522
- Yeah? Remember ocean?
- Ocean?

585
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:22,233
Yeah. Cut me loose.

586
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:28,073
Cut the rope. Cut the rope!

587
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:35,330
Cut.

588
01:05:13,535 --> 01:05:16,955
They're loose! They got loose!

589
01:06:47,462 --> 01:06:50,632
They're loose! They're loose!

590
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:03,144
(Dan) Let's go and fetch the girls.

591
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:05,104
Hit 'em, hit 'em!

592
01:07:09,317 --> 01:07:11,236
Stop! Come on.

593
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:16,115
(Bill) Let's go.

594
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:49,167
Come on, let's get that second one.

595
01:09:02,347 --> 01:09:04,724
Quick! You gotta jump it!

596
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:06,142
I can't!

597
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:08,061
You can!

598
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:09,228
I can't, Bill!

599
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:11,773
You can, damn it, now jump it!

600
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:13,775
Do it, do it, do it!

601
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:39,509
Speed, Dan, speed!

602
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:40,760
Come on, do it!

603
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:42,053
Come on, do it.

604
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:50,520
Whoo! Whoo!

605
01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:52,438
I don't believe it.

606
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:54,565
Whoo-hoo!

607
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:03,241
(Continues cheering)

608
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:04,450
- I did it!
- You did it!

609
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:05,576
I did it!

610
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:06,953
(Shots)

611
01:10:07,078 --> 01:10:08,496
Shoot 'em, damn it, shoot 'em!

612
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,753
Sheriff? Sheriff?

613
01:11:40,004 --> 01:11:41,839
Sheriff!

614
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:45,134
- Sheriff?
- Deputy.

615
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:47,094
Look, we need some help.
Our wives have been kidnapped

616
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:48,888
and they're being held
up at Whiskey Mountain.

617
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,558
Come on, come on, come on,
do something.

618
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:54,769
Get the sheriff or somebody.

619
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:56,395
(Toilet flushing)

620
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,568
What's all the commotion about, Leo?

621
01:12:02,693 --> 01:12:04,946
What's this about
somebody gettin‘ kidnapped?

622
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:07,240
You see, Sheriff, it's our wives, er...

623
01:12:07,365 --> 01:12:10,201
We were up on Whiskey Mountain
and ran into some dope dealers.

624
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:13,079
- Bill and I...
- Wait a minute, son.

625
01:12:13,204 --> 01:12:16,040
There ain't no dope dealers
around here.

626
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,334
And there ain't no such thing
as Whiskey Mountain.

627
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:20,795
That's just local bullshit.

628
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,547
They got my wife up there,

629
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:25,633
and there is a guy named Rudy
who has fields of grass.

630
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:28,094
Drass? What's that?

631
01:12:28,219 --> 01:12:29,971
Grass! Grass is marijuana.

632
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:32,849
- Did you see any of it?
- Yeah, we saw bales of it, man.

633
01:12:32,974 --> 01:12:35,268
Now, I thought you said it was fields.

634
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:39,146
Hey, Sheriff...

635
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:43,234
...they've got my wife up there.

636
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:46,028
Well, if you ask me,

637
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:50,157
I believe you boys have been smokin‘
a little bit of that crazy stuff yourself.

638
01:12:50,283 --> 01:12:52,285
What the hell is wrong with you?

639
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:53,995
We need some help
and you're gonna help us.

640
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:57,123
Hell fire, man, you ain't got no proof.

641
01:12:57,248 --> 01:13:00,084
There is no such thing
as Whiskey Mountain.

642
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:01,794
It's just a legend.

643
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:04,005
Just local bullshit, that's all.

644
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:11,929
(scoffs)

645
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:13,306
You know, I don't believe you.

646
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:17,351
I think all of you people are crazy.

647
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:24,442
Sheriff, you should take that badge
and stick it!

648
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:27,069
Now, don't you go takin‘ the law
into your own hands.

649
01:13:27,194 --> 01:13:30,698
It won't work now, boy.
You hear? It won't work!

650
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,750
(Sighs)

651
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:44,587
Get some guns.

652
01:13:44,712 --> 01:13:46,380
Guns?

653
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:17,119
(Store owner) There you are, Jane.

654
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:20,498
You and Jessie better get 'em
this bag of food and supplies,

655
01:14:20,623 --> 01:14:22,041
it's getting pretty cold.

656
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:25,378
(Jane) That's right, Frank.
Looks like it's gonna be a cold winter.

657
01:14:25,503 --> 01:14:29,173
Jessie said all the animals have got
an extra thick coat of fur on 'em.

658
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:33,594
Jessie's chopping a lot of extra firewood.

659
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:39,475
Nice to see ya.

660
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:43,145
What can I do for you?

661
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:44,981
Yeah, we wanna see
a couple of shotguns.

662
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:46,941
Let me get them for you.

663
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:55,199
That's a real gun.

664
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:58,119
- How much you want for it?
- $139.95.

665
01:14:58,244 --> 01:14:59,745
Got another one?

666
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:04,041
- How much is this?
- 120 bucks.

667
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,002
That's good, and I, er...

668
01:15:06,711 --> 01:15:09,380
...I'd like to have that knife
right there.

669
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,007
Yes, sir.

670
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:22,685
(Telephone ringing)

671
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:24,812
Excuse me a minute.

672
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:27,940
Frank's Hardware.

673
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:30,901
(Sheriff) 'Now, them two boys
that just come into your store.

674
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:33,446
'Don't you sell them no guns or nothin'.

675
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:35,239
'Yeah, they're troublemakers.'

676
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:38,576
Now, just tell 'em you gotta have
a license or somethin',

677
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:41,704
and if they give you any trouble,
I'll be right on over.

678
01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:47,376
'And listen, tell those boys
to stay on the track,

679
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:49,795
'tell 'em they need to get out, OK?'

680
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,714
OK, I got you.

681
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:54,383
I'm sorry, fellas,
I can't let you have them guns.

682
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:56,177
You're not a resident of this county.

683
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:58,804
What the hell's going on here?

684
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:02,808
You lie down, flat on your stomach.
Put your hands behind your head.

685
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:05,603
- To hell with you!
- Come on, come on. Get on down.

686
01:16:16,781 --> 01:16:18,699
There's over 300 dollars here.

687
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:21,160
Now, that's gonna cover
everything we took.

688
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:32,088
Jesus, Dan, cover my back
till I'm loaded.

689
01:16:32,213 --> 01:16:34,048
(Dan) OK, keep your eyes open.

690
01:16:34,173 --> 01:16:36,509
They've might have followed us
all the way into town.

691
01:16:36,634 --> 01:16:37,635
(Vehicle approaching)

692
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,221
Here comes one of 'em.

693
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,141
Let's go.

694
01:16:45,935 --> 01:16:47,603
Fire. Fire!

695
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:37,523
Hey, Bill?

696
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:43,237
Hey, Bill, come on, man.

697
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:23,652
Oh, you... you dummy.

698
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:23,462
(Shots)

699
01:22:03,877 --> 01:22:06,338
Alright, get the girls out.

700
01:22:07,381 --> 01:22:08,882
Come on, come on.

701
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:14,680
(Homer grunts)

702
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:20,394
They locked the door, Mr. Rudy,
and damn near bust my hand.

703
01:22:20,519 --> 01:22:24,481
Charlie? Get up here
and help Homer, will you?

704
01:22:30,362 --> 01:22:33,115
You and Jack,
now get that one over there.

705
01:22:37,161 --> 01:22:39,163
Jamie!

706
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:46,837
Jamie!

707
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:50,132
Push,push,push!

708
01:22:50,924 --> 01:22:52,342
Push!

709
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:03,479
Rudy!

710
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:09,193
Damn, he hit us.

711
01:23:11,195 --> 01:23:13,280
(Rudy) Luke, get back here. Luke!

712
01:23:13,405 --> 01:23:15,282
You yellowbelly, get back here!

713
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:17,451
Jack, Jack, my gun, my gun!

714
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:21,622
I don't see the other one.

715
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:25,417
You guys, try to circle around
and flush him out.

716
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:16,927
(Gun clicks)

717
01:24:27,271 --> 01:24:29,606
Rudy!

718
01:24:54,381 --> 01:24:55,799
(Gasps) on!

719
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:57,342
(Dan) Jamie?

720
01:24:59,136 --> 01:25:00,804
- Jamie!
- It's Dan.

721
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:02,598
It's Dan!

722
01:25:05,892 --> 01:25:07,311
(Jamie) Dan!

723
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:30,250
- Where's Bill?
- Diana? Diana.

724
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:31,793
What?

725
01:25:35,589 --> 01:25:37,007
Well, he...

726
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:38,967
(Sighs)

727
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:41,845
Oh, no.

728
01:25:44,348 --> 01:25:45,349
Oh...

729
01:26:36,316 --> 01:26:37,901
Come on.

730
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:39,778
