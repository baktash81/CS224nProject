00:00:23,729 --> 00:00:27,096
~ Brazil ~

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,159
~ Where hearts
were entertained in June ~

3
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:37,299
~ We stood beneath
an amber moon ~

4
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:41,311
~ And softly murmured
someday soon ~

5
00:00:41,413 --> 00:00:46,180
- ~ Someday ~
- ~ We'd kiss ~

6
00:00:46,285 --> 00:00:49,277
~ We'd kiss ~

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,415
~ Central Services ~

00:00:53,525 --> 00:00:56,016
~ We do the work
You do the pleasure ~

9
00:00:56,128 --> 00:01:00,087
Hi there.
I want talk to you about ducts.

10
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:04,863
Do your ducts seem old-fashioned,
out-of-date?

11
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,962
Central Services's new duct designs...

12
00:01:08,073 --> 00:01:11,304
are now available
in hundreds of different colors...

13
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,277
to suit your individual taste.

14
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:20,148
Hurry now, while stocks last,
to your nearest Central Services showroom.

15
00:01:20,252 --> 00:01:24,052
Designer colors to suit
your demanding taste.

16
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:47,535
Tonight we have with us,
from the Ministry of Information...

17
00:01:47,646 --> 00:01:50,308
Deputy Minister Eugene Helpmann.

18
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:52,316
Good evening, David.

19
00:01:52,418 --> 00:01:56,752
What do you believe is behind
this recent increase in terrorist bombings?

20
00:01:56,855 --> 00:01:59,221
Bad sportsmanship.

21
00:01:59,324 --> 00:02:01,554
A ruthless minority of people...

22
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,790
seems to have forgotten certain
good old-fashioned virtues.

23
00:02:05,898 --> 00:02:09,129
They just can't stand
seeing the other fella win.

24
00:02:09,234 --> 00:02:11,759
If these people
would just play the game...

25
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,929
they'd get a lot more out of life.

26
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:16,837
Nevertheless, Mr. Helpmann,
there are those who maintain...

27
00:02:16,942 --> 00:02:20,275
that the Ministry of Information
has become too large and unwieldy.

28
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:23,576
David, in a free society,
information's the name of the game.

29
00:02:23,682 --> 00:02:26,446
You can't win the game
ifyou're a man short.

30
00:02:26,552 --> 00:02:30,886
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister.
Seven percent of the gross national product.

31
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:34,220
I understand this concern
on behalf of the taxpayer.

32
00:02:34,326 --> 00:02:36,226
People want value for money.

33
00:02:36,328 --> 00:02:41,698
That's why we always insist on the principle
of information retrieval charges.

34
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,894
- It's absolutely right and fair...

35
00:02:45,003 --> 00:02:48,234
that those found guilty should pay
for their periods of detention...

36
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,834
and for the information retrieval
procedures used in their interrogation.

37
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,871
Do you bel ieve that the government
is winning the battle against terrorists?

38
00:02:56,982 --> 00:03:00,782
Oh, yes. Our morale
is m uch higher than theirs.

39
00:03:00,886 --> 00:03:03,753
We're fielding all theirstrokes,
running a lot ofthem out...

40
00:03:03,856 --> 00:03:06,723
and pretty consistently
knocking them for six.

41
00:03:09,495 --> 00:03:11,486
I'd say they're nearly out ofthe game.

42
00:03:19,171 --> 00:03:22,937
...law-abiding citizens
to have to subsidize criminals?

43
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:27,273
But, Mr. Helpmann, the bombing campaign
is now in its 1 3th year.

44
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:29,609
Beginner's luck.

45
00:03:30,649 --> 00:03:32,583
Thank you very much,
Deputy Minister.

46
00:03:32,751 --> 00:03:34,685
Thank you, David.

47
00:03:34,786 --> 00:03:37,550
And a very merry Christmas
to you all.

48
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:42,149
"Scrooge was better than his word.

49
00:03:42,261 --> 00:03:45,389
"He did it all, and infinitely more.

50
00:03:45,497 --> 00:03:48,523
- "And to Tiny Tim, who did not die...

51
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:51,626
" he became a second father.

52
00:03:51,737 --> 00:03:56,140
" He became as good a friend
in the good old world.

53
00:03:56,241 --> 00:03:59,540
"And so, as Tiny Tim observed...

54
00:03:59,645 --> 00:04:02,978
God bless us, every one."

55
00:04:06,385 --> 00:04:08,785
- Are you boys giving me the runaround?
- Where are you?

56
00:04:08,887 --> 00:04:12,084
- Step right up. This way. Hey, hey, hey, hey!.

57
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,249
Don't throw that.
That's only for long distance.

58
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:16,259
- All right.

59
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:19,091
- I'm sorry, boys, but we haven't got any vacancies.
- Got no vacancies.

60
00:04:19,197 --> 00:04:21,722
- We got plenty of rooms.
- That's all right. We take a room.

61
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,767
- All right.
- All right. We take a vacancy.

62
00:04:23,869 --> 00:04:26,497
- Boy, take the gentlemen's baggage.

63
00:04:32,578 --> 00:04:35,274
- Who's there?

64
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:39,247
Who is that?

65
00:04:39,351 --> 00:04:43,310
Father Christmas can't come
ifwe haven't got a chimney.

66
00:04:43,422 --> 00:04:45,822
- You'll see.

67
00:05:02,774 --> 00:05:04,036
- No!.

68
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,044
- What's going on?

69
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:13,310
No!.

70
00:05:27,485 --> 00:05:29,666
I hereby inform you,
under powers entrusted to me...

71
00:05:29,755 --> 00:05:30,800
under section 4th and 6th

72
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,824
that Mr. Buttle, Archibald, residing at
412 North Tower, Shangrila Towers...

73
00:05:35,097 --> 00:05:38,066
has been invited to assist the Ministry
of Information with certain inquiries...

74
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:40,727
and that he is liable to
certain financial obligations...

75
00:05:40,836 --> 00:05:46,035
as specified in council order
RB/CZ/907/X.

76
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:48,041
- Sign here, please.

77
00:05:50,546 --> 00:05:52,946
Where are you taking him?

78
00:05:53,048 --> 00:05:55,710
There.

79
00:05:55,818 --> 00:05:59,117
Thank you.
Same again, please.

80
00:05:59,221 --> 00:06:02,281
Just there.
Press harder his time.

81
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:05,758
- Good.
- What is this all about?

82
00:06:05,861 --> 00:06:09,422
That is your receipt for your husband.
Thankyou.

83
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:11,658
And this is my receipt for your receipt.

84
00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:13,962
Mrs. Buttle, are you okay?

85
00:06:17,273 --> 00:06:19,571
- Ho!. Ho!.
- We're Department of Works!

86
00:06:19,675 --> 00:06:22,508
Department of Works up here!

87
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:24,670
Careful with those bloody things.

88
00:06:25,848 --> 00:06:27,782
Don't take any notice of them, love.

89
00:06:27,883 --> 00:06:30,249
Don't touch me.
Why don't you just get the hell out of here.

90
00:06:30,352 --> 00:06:33,287
Don't you worry, love.
We'l I have everything shipshape in a jiffy.

91
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:37,655
- That's it. Nothing to worry about.
- Right. It's Tuttle downstairs who can worry, eh?

92
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,991
Tuttle? His name's Buttle.
There must be some mistake.

93
00:06:41,096 --> 00:06:43,997
Mistake?
We don't make mistakes.

94
00:06:45,234 --> 00:06:48,499
- That's bloody typical.

95
00:06:48,604 --> 00:06:51,095
They've gone back to metric
without telling us.

96
00:06:51,206 --> 00:06:53,538
Mrs. Buttle, are you all right?

97
00:06:53,642 --> 00:06:55,610
Yeah. Uh, uh -

98
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:27,969
" Buttle."

99
00:08:30,372 --> 00:08:32,340
Buttle, Archibald.

100
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:34,807
Ridiculous name.

101
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,308
On the twenty -

102
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:43,851
Oh, shit.

103
00:08:43,952 --> 00:08:46,853
- Mr. -

104
00:08:49,058 --> 00:08:51,754
Mr. Lowry, would you
step in here, please?

105
00:09:23,726 --> 00:09:25,660
Ah.

106
00:09:26,863 --> 00:09:29,798
I say, h-has anybody seen Lowry?

107
00:09:32,702 --> 00:09:37,332
Has anybody seen Sam Lowry?

108
00:10:12,575 --> 00:10:15,203
Sam.

109
00:10:22,085 --> 00:10:23,985
Sam.

110
00:10:51,214 --> 00:10:53,546
- Hello.
- Hello? Sam. Where are you?

111
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,811
- Hello?
- It's 11:00.

112
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:58,046
- What?
- 11:00!

113
00:10:58,154 --> 00:11:00,486
- Mr. Kurtzmann.
- Yes.

114
00:11:03,293 --> 00:11:05,523
- It's 11:00.
- Is it?

115
00:11:08,965 --> 00:11:12,526
- Oh. The electrics here are up the spout.

116
00:11:12,635 --> 00:11:14,933
- I know. Look -
- Oh, yours too?

117
00:11:15,038 --> 00:11:18,474
- Yes.
- Oh, well, um, I'll be there as soon as I can.

118
00:11:18,575 --> 00:11:20,475
- Yes. Thanks. Bye.
- Hurry up.

119
00:11:35,425 --> 00:11:37,620
- Hello, Sammy.

120
00:11:37,727 --> 00:11:40,059
What have you got to say?

121
00:12:00,283 --> 00:12:03,116
Oh, very good, Sammy.

122
00:12:18,134 --> 00:12:22,628
...famous statue
pairing truth and freedom.

123
00:12:22,739 --> 00:12:25,674
This is not the only statue -
Shut up!

124
00:12:25,775 --> 00:12:28,300
What's this gun for?

125
00:12:28,411 --> 00:12:31,938
This one, Sister,
is a nine-milimeter submachine gun...

126
00:12:32,048 --> 00:12:34,346
used for close-quarter combat fighting.

127
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,714
Very effective weapon.
Wouldyou like to see it?

128
00:12:47,797 --> 00:12:50,493
- Oh.

129
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,228
Ooh!

130
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,551
Sam!

131
00:13:10,586 --> 00:13:13,077
Jack!

132
00:13:13,189 --> 00:13:15,851
- Well -
- Long time no see.

133
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,483
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

134
00:13:18,594 --> 00:13:21,324
I don't expect to see you
slumming it in Records.

135
00:13:21,431 --> 00:13:24,992
- What's the problem?
- Problem? No problem.
Everything's fine. Wonderful. Marvelous.

136
00:13:25,101 --> 00:13:27,160
Alison's in great shape.
Kids are fine.

137
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,831
I'm on Security Level 5 now,
so Mr. Helpmann relies on me more and more.

138
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,568
- It's been a great year.
- You sound worried.

139
00:13:33,676 --> 00:13:36,702
Worried? Me?
If I'm worried about anyone, Sam, it's you.

140
00:13:36,813 --> 00:13:40,112
I mean, look at you, Sam.
Whatever happened to you?

141
00:13:40,216 --> 00:13:42,013
Records?

142
00:13:42,118 --> 00:13:43,881
Sam, you were one of the brightest -

143
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:55,796
Sam?

144
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,898
Uh, Jack, it's great to see you.

145
00:14:00,002 --> 00:14:02,129
- I'm gonna be late.
- Sam.

146
00:14:02,238 --> 00:14:05,071
Let a friend tell you.
Your life is going wrong.

147
00:14:05,174 --> 00:14:08,109
Records is a dead-end department.
No security level worth a damn.

148
00:14:08,211 --> 00:14:10,577
- It's impossible to get noticed.
- I know.

149
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,240
Wonderful. Marvelous.

150
00:14:13,349 --> 00:14:15,579
Perfect. See you, Jack.

151
00:14:15,685 --> 00:14:18,415
- Give my regards to Alison and the twins.
- Triplets.

152
00:14:18,521 --> 00:14:21,957
Triplets? God.
How time flies.

153
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,828
A very clear delineation of picture this has.
Adamant, mobile.

154
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,898
Next.

155
00:14:33,903 --> 00:14:36,235
I want to report a wrongful arrest.

156
00:14:37,407 --> 00:14:40,570
You want Information Adjustments.
Different department.

157
00:14:40,676 --> 00:14:42,576
I've been to Information Adjustments.

158
00:14:42,678 --> 00:14:45,772
They sent me here. They said
you have a form I need to fill out.

159
00:14:45,882 --> 00:14:48,077
Have you got an arrest receipt?

160
00:14:48,184 --> 00:14:50,948
Yeah.

161
00:14:51,053 --> 00:14:54,648
- Is it stamped?
- Stamped?

162
00:14:56,659 --> 00:14:59,719
No, no.
There's no stamp on it, you see.

163
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:03,060
I can't let you have the form
until this is stamped.

164
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:07,500
- Where do I get it stamped?
- Information Adjustments.

165
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:24,760
It keeps picking up old films.

166
00:15:24,869 --> 00:15:26,928
That can't be right, can it?

167
00:15:27,038 --> 00:15:29,097
Perhaps the machine's on the blink.

168
00:15:29,207 --> 00:15:32,608
No, it's not the machine. There's a mismatch
on the personnel code numbers.

169
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:37,374
Tuttle should have had $31.06 debited
against his account, not Buttle.

170
00:15:37,482 --> 00:15:40,610
- My God! A mistake!
- Well, at least it's not ours.

171
00:15:40,718 --> 00:15:42,686
Isn't it? Whose is it?

172
00:15:42,787 --> 00:15:45,449
- Information Retrieval.
- Oh, good.

173
00:15:45,556 --> 00:15:48,116
Yeah. See, Expediting has put in
for electrical procedures...

174
00:15:48,226 --> 00:15:51,787
in respect of Buttle, Archibald,
shoe repair operative...

175
00:15:51,896 --> 00:15:56,026
but Security has invoiced Admin
for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer.

176
00:15:56,134 --> 00:15:58,659
Oh, what a relief.
Finish your tea, Sam.

177
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:01,260
What? Oh. Thanks.

178
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,837
I don't know what I would do
if you ever got promoted.

179
00:16:05,943 --> 00:16:09,401
- Oh, God, don't worry about that.
- No, but if they did promote you, uh -

180
00:16:11,382 --> 00:16:13,816
I've told you before.
I'd turn it down.

181
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:15,852
- Would you? Really?
- Really.

182
00:16:15,953 --> 00:16:18,421
You've been promoted.

183
00:16:22,627 --> 00:16:25,653
It's your mother, isn't it?
Pulling strings again.

184
00:16:30,902 --> 00:16:35,100
Sam, it's time foryou
to grow up and accept responsibility.

185
00:16:35,206 --> 00:16:39,836
Your poor father would be appalled
at your lack of promotion. Ooh!

186
00:16:39,944 --> 00:16:43,539
Mother, I just wish
you would stop interfering.

187
00:16:43,648 --> 00:16:46,913
I don't want promotion.
I'm happy where I am.

188
00:16:47,018 --> 00:16:50,419
No, you're not.
Jack Lint is a lesson to you.

189
00:16:50,521 --> 00:16:53,649
He doesn't have your brains,
but he's got the ambition.

190
00:16:53,758 --> 00:16:55,749
You haven't got the ambition.

191
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,727
Luckily, you've got me
and the deputy minister.

192
00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:01,992
- Mr. Helpmann was very close to your father.
- Now, please, Mrs. Lowry.

193
00:17:02,099 --> 00:17:04,192
Don't get upset.

194
00:17:04,302 --> 00:17:06,793
Mr. Lowry, please wait in reception.
You're giving her wrinkles.

195
00:17:06,904 --> 00:17:08,804
- You see?
- God!

196
00:17:08,906 --> 00:17:11,534
Just try and relax, Mrs. Lowry.

197
00:17:11,642 --> 00:17:13,542
I'll make you 20 years younger.

198
00:17:13,644 --> 00:17:16,977
- Ha!
- Yoo-hoo, Dr. Jaffe. You are a genius.

199
00:17:17,081 --> 00:17:19,606
Would you like to be surgeon general?

200
00:17:19,717 --> 00:17:22,151
I know simply everybody.

201
00:17:22,253 --> 00:17:25,245
Well, they won't know you
when I've finished with you.

202
00:17:25,356 --> 00:17:28,382
- Mmm.
- First...

203
00:17:28,492 --> 00:17:30,653
we remove the excess derma.

204
00:17:30,761 --> 00:17:32,661
- So.
- Mmm.

205
00:17:32,763 --> 00:17:37,928
Now the flaccid tissues
under the eyes and the forehead.

206
00:17:38,035 --> 00:17:39,764
- Zip.
- Oh.

207
00:17:41,672 --> 00:17:45,005
Now, I lift...

208
00:17:45,109 --> 00:17:47,407
the wrinkles and the worry lines...

209
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:50,002
right up into the wig,
into the hairline.

210
00:17:52,116 --> 00:17:53,947
Now the template.

211
00:17:55,886 --> 00:17:58,616
- Mercy.
- There. Now a bit of sticky.

212
00:17:58,723 --> 00:18:00,623
Like so.

213
00:18:00,725 --> 00:18:04,593
And already she's twice as beautiful
as she was before. Voila!

214
00:18:06,697 --> 00:18:08,500
My God, it works.

215
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,482
- Ah, Madame Lowry.

216
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,288
You look exquisite today.
Merry Christmas.

217
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,828
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.

218
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,364
- Sorry.
- Uh, you remember my son, Samuel.

219
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:23,162
- Of course.
- We're joining Mrs. Terrain.

220
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:26,670
- Yes. The lady's waiting.
- Are we? God.

221
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,800
This way.

222
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,004
Mother. Mother, I thought we were
going to be able to talk.

223
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,172
- We will. We will.
- Ida, Sam.

224
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:39,012
- Oh, God. She's got what's her name with her.
- Yoo-hoo!

225
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,348
Sam!

226
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:46,255
Well, Alma. How are you?
You look wonderful.

227
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:49,123
Hello, Shirley.

228
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,719
Thankyou, Spiro.

229
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,924
- Salt?
- Not yet.

230
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:56,399
Sam, happy Christmas.

231
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,402
Oh!

232
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,529
- So sorry we're late.
- Thanks.

233
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,074
Now, Alma...

234
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,143
what are you going to have?

235
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:09,010
I can't make up my mind whether
to have the number one or the number two.

236
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:12,448
- What do you recommend, Spiro?
- Between you and me, madame...

237
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,451
today the number two.

238
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:17,954
Thankyou, Spiro.
Shirley. Shirley, what are you going to have?

239
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:22,289
Between you and me, mademoiselle,
today the number one.

240
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:26,263
- Madame Lowry?
- Oh, to hell with the diet.

241
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,526
I'm going to have a number eight, please.

242
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:32,092
- A most perceptive choice if I dare say so, madame.
- Oh, Ida!

243
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,104
- Monsieur.
- Steak, please. Rare. Mother -

244
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:37,232
- Monsieur, quel numero?
- I don't know which number. Mother, please -

245
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,709
- That one. There.
- That's fine. Thanks.

246
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:42,542
- Mother, will you please listen to me.
- Alma! You wicked girl.

247
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,742
- You've started your treatment.
- Say the number, please.

248
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,150
- You noticed.
- You have to say the number!

249
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:52,019
- Will you please go away! I'm trying to talk -
- I must tell you all about it.

250
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,092
Number three.

251
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,295
Mother, will you listen to me.
I haven't -

252
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,523
Numero huit.

253
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:04,899
Braised veal in wine sauce.

254
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,904
- Ooh!
- Mmm!

255
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:12,103
It's too exciting.
I've left Dr. Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.

256
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,839
- Numero deux. Duck a I'orange.
- Dr. Chapman? Chapman?

257
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,847
- Excusez-moi.

258
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,349
- The acid man?

259
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:22,853
Really, Ida! Just because
his techniques are revolutionary...

260
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:26,186
I don't go around
calling Dr. Jaffe the knife man.

261
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:28,852
Numero un, crevettes a la mayonnaise.

262
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:32,795
- I am sorry, Alma. I didn't mean to sound so -
- It's all right, Ida. It's just -

263
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,834
Steak. Numero trois.

264
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,169
Mesdames, monsieur...

265
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,298
bon appetit.

266
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,604
- Merci.
- Merci.

267
00:20:46,693 --> 00:20:49,423
Salt?

268
00:21:11,084 --> 00:21:12,984
What were we saying?

269
00:21:13,086 --> 00:21:16,385
- This isn't rare.
- Oh! By the by, Alma...

270
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:20,220
I saw the most wonderful idea
for Christmas presents at the chemist's.

271
00:21:20,326 --> 00:21:23,159
Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens.

272
00:21:23,263 --> 00:21:25,163
Oh, that sounds marvelous!

273
00:21:25,265 --> 00:21:28,701
It's good at any doctor's
and most of the major hospitals.

274
00:21:28,801 --> 00:21:32,328
It's also accepted
for gynecological examinations...

275
00:21:32,438 --> 00:21:34,838
- including cesarean section.

276
00:21:34,941 --> 00:21:37,671
- Spiro.
- I 'm sorry, madame. I don't know what to say.

277
00:21:37,777 --> 00:21:39,745
I t never real ly happens to us.

278
00:21:39,846 --> 00:21:42,041
I 'm going to do something
about it straightaway.

279
00:21:42,148 --> 00:21:45,845
Really, Sam! Why can't you
do something about these terrorists?

280
00:21:45,952 --> 00:21:48,978
- It's my lunch hour.

281
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:51,147
Besides, it's not my department.

282
00:21:51,257 --> 00:21:55,819
Actually, Alma, that was one of
the little things I 've been dying to tell you.

283
00:21:55,928 --> 00:22:01,059
Look. Sam's been promoted
to Information Retrieval.

284
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:05,069
Oh, that's wonderful!
Congratulations, Sam!

285
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:08,902
Stop it! I'm not being promoted.
I'm not going to Information Retrieval.

286
00:22:09,008 --> 00:22:12,637
If I want you to stickyour oar in, Mother,
I'll tell you where to stick it.

287
00:22:16,683 --> 00:22:18,651
Pepper?

288
00:22:20,286 --> 00:22:22,186
I've gotta go.

289
00:22:22,288 --> 00:22:25,086
- Sam, you haven't had your dessert.
- I don't want dessert.

290
00:22:25,191 --> 00:22:28,592
- I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
- Of course you want something.

291
00:22:28,695 --> 00:22:31,528
You must have hopes, wishes, dreams!

292
00:22:31,631 --> 00:22:33,997
No, nothing. Not even dreams.

293
00:22:44,544 --> 00:22:46,671
Sam.

294
00:23:18,678 --> 00:23:19,645
Sam!

295
00:24:01,457 --> 00:24:04,620
- Oh, God.

296
00:24:20,219 --> 00:24:22,551
Hello. Central Services?

297
00:24:22,655 --> 00:24:25,715
I 'm at 579 B, Block 19,
Northwestern Section "D."

298
00:24:25,825 --> 00:24:29,056
That's exit one on Green Pastures Highway
at the Orange Blossom Flyover.

299
00:24:29,162 --> 00:24:32,654
And I've got trouble with my air-conditioning.
It's an emergency.

300
00:24:32,765 --> 00:24:34,665
Thankyou for calling Central Services.

301
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:36,667
I'm sorry.
Due to temporary staff shortage...

302
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:41,468
Central Services cannot take service calls
centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours.

303
00:24:41,574 --> 00:24:45,169
- Have a nice day. This has not been a recording.
- This is an emergency.

304
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:47,576
Thankyou for calling Central Services.
I'm sorry. Due to -

305
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,911
- No. I've got to have a heating engineer.
- Thankyou for calling Central Services.

306
00:24:51,017 --> 00:24:52,917
Oh, shit.

307
00:25:17,543 --> 00:25:19,443
Hello.

308
00:25:28,755 --> 00:25:30,882
- Hello.
- Hello.

309
00:25:31,924 --> 00:25:34,324
- Hello.
- Hello.

310
00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:38,522
- Hello.
- Hello.

311
00:25:39,966 --> 00:25:41,866
Hello. Mr. Lowry.

312
00:25:41,968 --> 00:25:43,936
Yes. Who is this?

313
00:25:44,037 --> 00:25:47,473
Put the phone down
and raise your hands.

314
00:25:47,573 --> 00:25:49,541
What? Who is this?

315
00:25:53,046 --> 00:25:55,014
Nice and easy now.

316
00:25:55,114 --> 00:25:57,082
Nice and easy.

317
00:26:01,187 --> 00:26:03,815
Just keep your hands
where I can see them.

318
00:26:27,914 --> 00:26:30,280
What - What are you doing?

319
00:26:35,488 --> 00:26:37,718
Harry Tuttle.
Heating engineer at your service.

320
00:26:42,395 --> 00:26:44,920
Tuttle?

321
00:26:45,031 --> 00:26:46,931
Are you from Central Services?

322
00:26:52,872 --> 00:26:54,806
I called Central Services.

323
00:26:54,907 --> 00:26:57,341
Well, they're a little
overworked these days.

324
00:26:57,443 --> 00:26:59,604
Luckily I intercepted your call.

325
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:02,476
You did -

326
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:06,848
Just a minute.
What was that business with the gun?

327
00:27:06,953 --> 00:27:08,887
I t's just a precaution, sir.

328
00:27:08,988 --> 00:27:10,888
Just a precaution.

329
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,925
I 've had traps set for me before now.

330
00:27:14,026 --> 00:27:16,517
And there are plenty of people
in Central Services...

331
00:27:16,629 --> 00:27:18,790
who'd love to
get their hands on Harry Tuttle.

332
00:27:21,033 --> 00:27:23,228
Are you telling me that this is illegal?

333
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:32,709
Well, yes and no. Officially, only Central Service
operatives are supposed to touch this stuff.

334
00:27:32,813 --> 00:27:34,713
- Would you hold this, please?
- Uh -

335
00:27:34,815 --> 00:27:37,113
But nowadays,
with all the new rules and regulations...

336
00:27:37,217 --> 00:27:39,185
they can't get decent staff anymore.

337
00:27:39,286 --> 00:27:42,187
So they tend to turn a blind eye
as long as I'm careful.

338
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:45,588
Mind you, if ever they could prove
that I've been working on their equipment...

339
00:27:45,692 --> 00:27:47,922
well, that's a pipe of a different color.

340
00:27:48,028 --> 00:27:50,826
- Wouldn't it be simpler just to work -
- Would you hold this for me?

341
00:27:50,931 --> 00:27:54,367
Sorry. Yes. I was saying, wouldn't it be simpler
to work with Central Services?

342
00:27:54,468 --> 00:27:56,959
Nah! Nah. Couldn't stand the pa -

343
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,800
- We're getting warm.

344
00:27:59,906 --> 00:28:03,273
- You couldn't what? Couldn't stand the what?
- Paperwork. Couldn't stand the paperwork.

345
00:28:03,377 --> 00:28:06,744
Listen. This whole system of yours
could be on fire...

346
00:28:06,847 --> 00:28:11,011
and I couldn't even turn on a kitchen tap
without filling out a 27B/6.

347
00:28:11,118 --> 00:28:13,814
Bloody paperwork.

348
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,115
I suppose one has to
expect a certain amount.

349
00:28:16,223 --> 00:28:19,192
Why? I came into this game
for the action, the excitement.

350
00:28:19,293 --> 00:28:24,424
Go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out,
wherever there's trouble, a man alone.

351
00:28:24,531 --> 00:28:28,467
Now they got the whole country sectioned off.
You can't make a move without a form.

352
00:28:44,151 --> 00:28:46,085
Found it.

353
00:28:46,186 --> 00:28:48,086
There's your problem.

354
00:28:48,188 --> 00:28:50,122
- Can you fix it?
- No, I can't.

355
00:28:50,223 --> 00:28:53,920
But I can bypass it
with one of these.

356
00:28:56,196 --> 00:28:58,164
Fine by me.

357
00:29:02,402 --> 00:29:04,370
- Are you expecting anyone?
- No.

358
00:29:09,042 --> 00:29:12,273
- Get down!
- Wait! Wait! Will you wait!

359
00:29:13,313 --> 00:29:15,281
Shh.

360
00:29:18,452 --> 00:29:21,580
- The flashlight.
- Ah!

361
00:29:23,557 --> 00:29:25,457
Central Services.

362
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,459
- Central Services.
- Oh, yes.

363
00:29:27,561 --> 00:29:29,461
- You rang, sir?
- You rang, sir?

364
00:29:29,563 --> 00:29:31,861
- Trouble with your air-conditioning?
- Air-conditioning, sir?

365
00:29:31,965 --> 00:29:34,297
No, it's - it's - it's, uh, all right.

366
00:29:34,401 --> 00:29:37,461
It's, um - It's fixed.

367
00:29:37,571 --> 00:29:39,266
- Fixed.
- Fixed?

368
00:29:39,373 --> 00:29:41,273
Yes, um -

369
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:43,570
I mean, it, um, fixed itself.

370
00:29:43,677 --> 00:29:46,237
- Oh, it fixed itself!.
- Fixed itself?

371
00:29:46,346 --> 00:29:48,541
Yes!

372
00:29:48,648 --> 00:29:50,548
Machines don't fix themselves.

373
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,845
No, they don't fix themselves, sir.

374
00:29:52,953 --> 00:29:56,354
- He's tampered with it, Dowser.
- I think he's tampered with it, Mr. Spoor.

375
00:29:56,456 --> 00:29:58,356
Sorryyou've had a wasted journey.

376
00:29:58,458 --> 00:30:00,358
Oh, that's all right.

377
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,928
- I think we'll go have a little look.
- No,you can't.

378
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:05,293
I think we should.
Yes, Mr. Spoor.

379
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:07,731
Have you got a 27B/6?

380
00:30:07,834 --> 00:30:10,325
27B/6?

381
00:30:10,437 --> 00:30:12,337
- 27B/6?

382
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:14,771
27-

383
00:30:16,777 --> 00:30:18,677
Now look what you've done to him!

384
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:22,806
Well, have you got a 27B/6?

385
00:30:22,916 --> 00:30:25,680
Not... as such.

386
00:30:27,053 --> 00:30:28,953
But we'll get one.

387
00:30:29,055 --> 00:30:32,422
- It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
- It's all right, then?

388
00:30:32,526 --> 00:30:35,859
Sorry. I'm a bit of a stickler
for paperwork, you see.

389
00:30:35,962 --> 00:30:39,022
I mean, where would we be
ifwe didn't stick to the correct procedures?

390
00:30:39,132 --> 00:30:41,532
We'll be back.

391
00:30:41,635 --> 00:30:43,694
We'll be back!

392
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:48,303
- It's all right.

393
00:30:48,408 --> 00:30:50,308
- Thanks for coming.

394
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,310
We'll be back,
you bloody little bastard!

395
00:30:52,412 --> 00:30:54,937
- Thank you.
- We'll show you!

396
00:30:59,719 --> 00:31:02,347
Well -

397
00:31:02,456 --> 00:31:05,357
Thanks, Lowry.
You're a good man in a tight corner.

398
00:31:05,459 --> 00:31:07,484
- Thanks.

399
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,755
Listen, um - I, uh -

400
00:31:13,834 --> 00:31:15,461
Well, I -

401
00:31:15,569 --> 00:31:17,867
I just happen to work
at the Ministry of Information.

402
00:31:17,971 --> 00:31:20,462
- What?
- And, uh -

403
00:31:20,574 --> 00:31:25,136
Well, I just happen to know
that Information Retrieval...

404
00:31:25,245 --> 00:31:28,874
are looking for an Archibald Tuttle,
heating engineer.

405
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:31,816
You, uh -

406
00:31:31,918 --> 00:31:34,216
You wouldn't, by any chance -

407
00:31:34,321 --> 00:31:36,016
Would you?

408
00:31:37,257 --> 00:31:40,021
My good friends call me Harry.

409
00:31:41,328 --> 00:31:43,990
Information Retrieval, huh?

410
00:31:44,097 --> 00:31:46,429
The big boys.
00:32:54,202 --> 00:32:56,102
What do they want you for?

411
00:31:57,644 --> 00:32:00,112
- Time to go.
- Sorry.

412
00:32:00,213 --> 00:32:02,681
- How's that?

413
00:32:05,719 --> 00:32:08,688
Listen, you, um -you really must
let me give you something.

414
00:32:14,294 --> 00:32:17,627
How much will it be for the, uh -
for the work?

415
00:32:17,731 --> 00:32:19,631
Ah, come on.

416
00:32:19,733 --> 00:32:22,702
You did me a favor.
ust check the corridor.

417
00:32:24,037 --> 00:32:26,938
Oh. Well, thanks.

418
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,941
Listen, kid,
we're all in it together.

419
00:32:30,043 --> 00:32:32,341
- Go on.
- Right.

420
00:32:37,851 --> 00:32:40,649
Okay.

421
00:32:45,325 --> 00:32:47,293
All clear.

422
00:33:15,388 --> 00:33:17,982
I think Kurtzmann
is getting suspicious.

423
00:33:20,694 --> 00:33:23,424
What's playing today?

424
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,430
Casablanca.

425
00:33:25,532 --> 00:33:28,501
Mr. Lowry, willyou step in here, please.

426
00:33:31,571 --> 00:33:33,539
Lowry!

427
00:33:35,108 --> 00:33:37,599
Sam Lowry!

428
00:33:44,751 --> 00:33:46,719
Psst!

429
00:33:49,122 --> 00:33:52,250
Thank God you're here.
We're in terrible trouble.

430
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:53,986
Shh.

431
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:03,464
- Look at this. Look at this.
- It's a check.

432
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,470
It's the refund for Tuttle.

433
00:34:05,572 --> 00:34:07,472
- Tuttle?
- Mm-hmm.

434
00:34:07,574 --> 00:34:10,475
No, no. Buttle.
I mean Buttle.

435
00:34:10,577 --> 00:34:12,772
It's been confusion
from the word go.

436
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:15,780
He's been overcharged for
Information Retrieval procedures...

437
00:34:15,882 --> 00:34:18,783
and someone somewhere
is trying to make us carry the can.

438
00:34:18,885 --> 00:34:22,321
Can I have a look?
I 've never seen a refund check before.

439
00:34:22,422 --> 00:34:24,390
I 'll bet it's Jeffries.

440
00:34:26,493 --> 00:34:28,393
Yes.

441
00:34:28,495 --> 00:34:31,396
He always believes that people should
pay more for their interrogation.

442
00:34:31,498 --> 00:34:33,398
And " B," he loathes me.

443
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,400
We've gotta get rid of it!

444
00:34:35,502 --> 00:34:37,402
Well, send it to somebody else.

445
00:34:37,504 --> 00:34:40,405
Better still, send it to Buttle.
After all, it's his check.

446
00:34:40,507 --> 00:34:42,907
I've tried that.
But look. Look at this.

447
00:34:43,009 --> 00:34:46,968
You see? The population census
has gotten him down as "dormanted."

448
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,481
Uh, the Central Collective Storehouse computer
has got him down as "deleted."

449
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:52,483
Hang on.

450
00:34:52,585 --> 00:34:54,985
Information Retrieval
has got him down as "inoperative."

451
00:34:55,088 --> 00:34:57,056
Security has got him down as "excised."

452
00:34:57,157 --> 00:34:59,887
- Administration has him down as "completed. "
- He's dead.

453
00:34:59,993 --> 00:35:01,984
Le -

454
00:35:02,095 --> 00:35:04,063
Dead?

455
00:35:05,965 --> 00:35:08,263
Well, that's awful.

456
00:35:12,172 --> 00:35:14,732
We'll never get rid
of the damn thing now.

457
00:35:15,842 --> 00:35:18,072
What we gonna do, Sam?

458
00:35:18,178 --> 00:35:20,078
Could try next of kin.

459
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,080
Next of kin!

460
00:35:22,182 --> 00:35:24,673
- Yes!

461
00:35:24,686 --> 00:35:26,586
What's the number on the check?

462
00:35:26,688 --> 00:35:30,385
Uh, 271 56789...

463
00:35:31,994 --> 00:35:36,226
/074328K.

464
00:35:38,701 --> 00:35:40,669
Right. Into memory.

465
00:35:42,104 --> 00:35:44,072
Central Banking.

466
00:35:45,274 --> 00:35:47,742
Veronica Buttle.

467
00:35:47,843 --> 00:35:49,743
Mrs.

468
00:35:49,845 --> 00:35:51,813
Deposit.

469
00:36:02,092 --> 00:36:03,992
Thank God for that.

470
00:36:04,094 --> 00:36:05,994
Uh, would you like some tea?

471
00:36:16,173 --> 00:36:19,768
There's a problem.
She doesn't have a bank account.

472
00:36:24,281 --> 00:36:26,249
Well, that's it, then.

473
00:36:27,284 --> 00:36:30,185
I might just as well
go and hang myself now.

474
00:36:33,156 --> 00:36:37,718
This sort of thing could never have happened
before this stupid seventh-tier reorganization.

475
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:41,958
That's Simmons's doing. And he and Jeffries
always sit together at lunch.

476
00:36:42,065 --> 00:36:43,760
Bastards!

477
00:36:43,867 --> 00:36:45,835
Sh - Shh. Shh.

478
00:36:49,573 --> 00:36:54,510
Perhaps we could lose the thing behind
a filing cabinet or something - burn it, eat it.

479
00:36:54,611 --> 00:36:56,511
Look, there is one solution.

480
00:36:56,613 --> 00:36:58,513
What?

481
00:36:58,615 --> 00:37:00,913
Drive out to Mrs. Buttle,
let her sign the back of the check.

482
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:04,112
She can cash it
at the corner sweet shop.

483
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:07,189
That's brilliant, Sam.

484
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,191
I'll even do it for you.

485
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:11,693
Here, authorize the check.
Sign there, there and there.

486
00:37:12,062 --> 00:37:14,189
- And sign the check there.
- Yes.

487
00:37:19,336 --> 00:37:21,896
I think I've broken a bone.

488
00:37:22,005 --> 00:37:23,905
Look, my wrist is all limp.

489
00:37:24,007 --> 00:37:26,407
What a pathetic creature I am!

490
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,671
Here.

491
00:37:28,778 --> 00:37:31,076
- I'll do it for you.

492
00:37:43,846 --> 00:37:44,546
Right.

493
00:37:44,618 --> 00:37:46,711
I'll be on my way.

494
00:37:48,927 --> 00:37:51,157
Sam?

495
00:37:50,863 --> 00:37:53,764
- Mm-hmm?

496
00:37:53,866 --> 00:37:56,460
You are good to me, you know.

497
00:37:56,569 --> 00:38:00,630
- Here's looking at you, kid.
- Here's looking at you.

498
00:38:00,773 --> 00:38:04,106
~ Brazil ~

499
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:09,273
~ Where hearts
were entertained in June ~

500
00:38:09,382 --> 00:38:15,321
~ We stood beneath an amber moon ~

501
00:38:15,421 --> 00:38:19,551
We interrupt this program to bring you news
ofa terrorist bombing at the Blue Lagoon -

502
00:38:22,829 --> 00:38:26,265
~ And clung together ~

503
00:38:26,365 --> 00:38:29,300
~ Then ~

504
00:38:29,402 --> 00:38:33,236
~ Tomorrow was another day ~

505
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:39,243
- ~ The morning found me miles away ~

506
00:38:39,345 --> 00:38:45,648
~ With still a million things to say ~

507
00:38:47,019 --> 00:38:49,579
~ Now ~

508
00:38:49,689 --> 00:38:54,626
~ When twilight dims the sky above ~

~ Recalling ~~

510
00:38:57,096 --> 00:38:59,997
Under Section 972/552.

511
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:03,000
H ello. I wonder
if you could tell m e where the -

512
00:39:03,102 --> 00:39:05,070
Piss off!.

513
00:39:09,275 --> 00:39:12,301
Hello.

514
00:39:12,411 --> 00:39:14,379
I'll never confess!

515
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:47,676
Mrs. Buttle?

516
00:39:49,979 --> 00:39:52,777
Uh, Mrs. Buttle?

517
00:40:00,389 --> 00:40:03,825
Ah. Um, are you Mrs. Buttle?

518
00:40:06,595 --> 00:40:08,563
Um...

519
00:40:11,267 --> 00:40:13,758
my name's Lowry.

520
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:16,269
Uh, Sam Lowry.

521
00:40:18,441 --> 00:40:21,239
Um, I'm from
the Ministry of Information.

522
00:40:23,512 --> 00:40:26,811
I've come to give you a check.

523
00:40:31,921 --> 00:40:34,219
Um, it's a refund, actually.

524
00:40:34,323 --> 00:40:37,292
- There was a mistake.
- Mistake?

525
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:40,192
Yes, they don't usually make mistakes,
but, uh...

526
00:40:40,297 --> 00:40:42,697
well, I suppose we're all human.

527
00:40:45,936 --> 00:40:47,836
Oh!

528
00:40:47,938 --> 00:40:49,906
What happened to the, um -

529
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:58,044
Actually, you know, my coming here
is rather unorthodox, bringing you this check...

530
00:40:58,148 --> 00:41:02,107
as any payments are normally
made through Central Computer, but, um -

531
00:41:02,219 --> 00:41:06,087
Well, as there were
certain... difficulties...

532
00:41:06,189 --> 00:41:09,158
we thought,
well, rather than cause delay...

533
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:11,489
we'd let you have it now.

534
00:41:11,595 --> 00:41:14,723
You know, it being Christmas and all.

535
00:41:14,831 --> 00:41:17,459
My husband's dead, isn't he?

536
00:41:19,402 --> 00:41:23,304
Um, I do assure you, Mrs. Buttle,
the ministry is very scrupulous...

537
00:41:23,406 --> 00:41:26,239
about following up
and eradicating any error.

538
00:41:26,343 --> 00:41:29,176
But ifyou do have any complaints
you wish to make...

539
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:33,511
I'd be, well, only too happy
to send you the appropriate forms.

540
00:41:33,617 --> 00:41:36,085
What have you done with his body?

541
00:41:38,722 --> 00:41:42,351
Oh!
Gosh.

542
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:45,360
Um, I-I don't know
anything about that, Mrs. Buttle.

543
00:41:45,462 --> 00:41:47,362
I'm really just delivering the check.

544
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:53,198
So, if, um - Look, ifyou wouldn't mind
just signing these two receipts...

545
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:57,763
I'd be only too happy to, uh -
to leave you in peace.

546
00:41:57,874 --> 00:42:00,365
He hadn't done anything.

547
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:02,377
He was good!

548
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:08,508
What have you done
with his body?

549
00:42:15,192 --> 00:42:17,922
It isn't being very helpful, Mrs. Buttle.

550
00:42:24,668 --> 00:42:27,068
I didn't have to come here,
you know, Mrs. Buttle.

551
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:30,071
I'll kill you!

552
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:32,073
I'll kill you, you bastard!

553
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:43,577
- Hey!

554
00:42:43,687 --> 00:42:45,780
Get off!.

555
00:42:45,889 --> 00:42:47,914
Are you all right?

556
00:42:49,292 --> 00:42:51,260
Are you all right?

557
00:42:55,165 --> 00:42:58,134
Mrs. Buttle, are you all right?

558
00:42:58,235 --> 00:43:00,100
It's you!

559
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:03,172
Wait! Stop! Don't go! Stop!

560
00:43:15,274 --> 00:43:16,901
Ow!

561
00:43:56,115 --> 00:43:59,084
Oh, look! He 'll never get that out!

562
00:44:10,832 --> 00:44:14,461
Stop! I had nothing
to do with it! Wait!

563
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:16,537
Stop!

564
00:44:20,842 --> 00:44:23,606
He 's coming back!

565
00:44:30,354 --> 00:44:32,252
- Jesus Christ!

566
00:44:32,529 --> 00:44:34,224
Jesus -

567
00:44:34,331 --> 00:44:37,562
- Go away.
- Her name's Jill.

568
00:44:37,668 --> 00:44:40,762
What? Jill?

569
00:44:40,871 --> 00:44:43,806
Jill who? Jill who?

570
00:44:44,908 --> 00:44:46,307
Layton.

571
00:44:48,579 --> 00:44:50,979
Jill Layton.

572
00:44:51,081 --> 00:44:54,448
You're a very good little girl.
What are you doing here?

573
00:44:54,551 --> 00:44:56,746
Waiting for my daddy.

574
00:44:56,854 --> 00:44:59,823
He will be pleased
when he gets home.

575
00:45:44,401 --> 00:45:48,599
Sam, I've just
had the Transport Pool onto me.

576
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:51,902
You don't anything about a personnel transporter
gone missing, do you?

577
00:45:52,009 --> 00:45:54,876
Personnel transporter? What?

578
00:45:54,978 --> 00:45:58,209
- Oh, the prannets. I had a personal transporter.
- Huh.

579
00:45:58,315 --> 00:46:00,215
I'll do the paperwork in the morning.

580
00:46:00,317 --> 00:46:03,718
Um, is it all right about Mrs. Tuttl -

581
00:46:03,821 --> 00:46:07,052
Uh, Buttle's check?

582
00:46:07,157 --> 00:46:09,057
- Uh-huh.
- Can I forget it?

583
00:46:09,159 --> 00:46:11,218
- Yeah.
- Oh, what a relief.

584
00:46:11,328 --> 00:46:13,592
I'm gonna have nightmares, you know.

585
00:46:15,999 --> 00:46:19,491
- Oh, damn and blast!
- What's the matter?

586
00:46:21,605 --> 00:46:24,665
I don't suppose you'd happen to know
how I can get round an I RQ/3, do you?

587
00:46:24,775 --> 00:46:27,744
Ooh, all information
on third-level suspects is classified.

588
00:46:27,845 --> 00:46:32,282
All inquiries through Information Retrieval,
and that's hopeless. They never tell you anything.

589
00:46:32,917 --> 00:46:37,445
There is one way I could get round it.
I could accept my mother's promotion.

590
00:46:37,555 --> 00:46:39,455
Yes.

591
00:46:39,557 --> 00:46:41,616
No!

592
00:46:41,726 --> 00:46:43,853
You can't.
You've just turned it down.

593
00:46:43,962 --> 00:46:46,123
I didn't sign the form.

594
00:46:47,265 --> 00:46:49,233
I did it foryou.

595
00:46:50,468 --> 00:46:53,198
- You didn't.
- I did.

596
00:46:53,304 --> 00:46:54,862
You didn't!

597
00:46:54,973 --> 00:46:57,134
I did!

598
00:46:57,241 --> 00:46:58,868
What did you do that for?

599
00:46:58,977 --> 00:47:02,003
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

600
00:47:02,113 --> 00:47:04,877
Oh, I don't know.

601
00:47:04,983 --> 00:47:07,110
I don't know what I want.

602
00:47:08,219 --> 00:47:11,188
Come on,
before they turn the lights out.

603
00:47:27,472 --> 00:47:29,372
There is one way round it.

604
00:47:29,474 --> 00:47:33,433
I could always accept promotion
to Information Retrieval.

605
00:48:13,017 --> 00:48:15,645
Sam!

606
00:49:25,556 --> 00:49:29,185
- Oh, Christ.

607
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:54,485
What are you doing?
What - My God! What's going on?

608
00:49:54,587 --> 00:49:57,818
- Emergency procedures.
- Emergency procedures!

609
00:49:57,923 --> 00:50:00,289
- I haven't got an emergency!
- Yeah?

610
00:50:00,392 --> 00:50:04,294
- This is an emergency!
- Have a nice day.
This has not been a recording.

611
00:50:04,396 --> 00:50:06,296
Aah!

612
00:50:06,398 --> 00:50:09,026
- Here. Sign that.

613
00:50:10,102 --> 00:50:12,900
- What is it?
- A 27B/6.

614
00:50:13,005 --> 00:50:15,166
What do you think it is?
Where's he gone?

615
00:50:15,274 --> 00:50:17,868
Spoor, come here!
Look! I got it! I found it!

616
00:50:17,977 --> 00:50:20,946
Spoor! Spoor!
Come here, Spoor!

617
00:50:21,046 --> 00:50:24,675
I t's a bypass valve on this -
on the transformer.

618
00:50:31,624 --> 00:50:33,524
- Tuttle!

619
00:50:33,626 --> 00:50:35,924
Tuttle. It's Tuttle.

620
00:50:37,296 --> 00:50:39,389
You've had that scab Tuttle here,
ain't ya?

621
00:50:39,498 --> 00:50:42,194
What are you talking about?

622
00:50:42,301 --> 00:50:45,202
- Who fixed your ducts? Huh?
- Fixed your ducts, all right.

623
00:50:45,304 --> 00:50:47,363
I told you before -
they fixed themselves.

624
00:50:47,473 --> 00:50:50,374
Oh, yeah? Then where did this
come from, eh?

625
00:50:50,476 --> 00:50:53,138
Out ofyour nostril? Eh?

626
00:50:53,245 --> 00:50:55,713
- Nostrils, eh?

627
00:50:57,283 --> 00:50:59,251
Central Services.

628
00:51:01,587 --> 00:51:03,487
They don't take kindly to sabotage.

629
00:51:03,589 --> 00:51:07,047
- Sabotage, huh?

630
00:51:08,394 --> 00:51:11,830
- Jesus, this place is in a terrible state.

631
00:51:11,931 --> 00:51:14,866
Just a minute!
You're not gonna leave it like this, are you?

632
00:51:14,967 --> 00:51:18,733
Why not? Al I you gotta do
is blow your nose and it's fixed, innit?

633
00:51:18,838 --> 00:51:20,772
That's right!

634
00:51:20,873 --> 00:51:22,841
Wel I -

635
00:51:24,476 --> 00:51:26,467
Oh, my -

636
00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:28,547
Jesus!

637
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:02,870
What haveyou done with his body?

638
00:52:50,977 --> 00:52:54,310
~ Mrs. Ida Lowry requests

639
00:52:54,414 --> 00:52:56,348

647
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:31,482
thanks.

648
00:53:31,584 --> 00:53:34,417
- It's reply paid.
- Is it?

649
00:53:34,521 --> 00:53:37,319
Oh. Um -

650
00:53:38,792 --> 00:53:40,692
Two, three -

651
00:53:40,794 --> 00:53:43,695
~ Mother, I'm sorry, but I'm unable
to come to your party ~

652
00:53:43,797 --> 00:53:46,493
- You don't have to sing it.
- I don't?

653
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:48,499
No.

654
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:51,069
Oh. Sorry.

655
00:53:54,207 --> 00:53:57,438
Aren't you a bit late?
I mean, the party started an hour ago.

656
00:53:57,544 --> 00:53:59,603
Yeah. It's the backlog.
Everybody complains.

657
00:53:59,712 --> 00:54:01,680
- Oh.
- Was it all right otherwise?

658
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:15,860
Mr. Helpmann, I'm keen to
get into Information Retrieval.

659
00:54:15,962 --> 00:54:18,988
Mr. Helpmann, I'm dying
to get at this woman. No, no - Ohh!

660
00:54:19,098 --> 00:54:21,066
Oh, God.

661
00:54:24,871 --> 00:54:27,772
- Hold up.
- What? Who are you?

662
00:54:27,874 --> 00:54:30,775
- Hey! What's going on?
- Where's your invitation?

663
00:54:30,877 --> 00:54:34,369
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Mother! Mother!

664
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,380
Sam.

665
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:39,212
I'm so glad you came.

666
00:54:39,319 --> 00:54:41,719
Come in.

667
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:44,551
- Mother?
- Come in.

668
00:54:45,592 --> 00:54:47,992
Oh, God, Mother, is that you?

669
00:54:48,094 --> 00:54:50,995
Of course.
Isn't it wonderful?

670
00:54:51,097 --> 00:54:54,396
- The bandages came off just this afternoon.

671
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:58,402
Come on, darling. Join in the fun.
Simply everybody's here.

672
00:54:58,504 --> 00:55:00,404
- Is Mr. Helpmann here?

673
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:02,406
- Would you stop shoving -
- Yes, he is.

674
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:05,409
Mr. Helpmann is here,
and he wants to talk to you.

675
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:07,741
Good. I want to talk to him.

676
00:55:07,847 --> 00:55:11,908
He says that you're the first person
ever to refuse a promotion.

677
00:55:12,018 --> 00:55:14,418
- Ah, well -
- He thinks you should see a doctor.

678
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:18,354
- Actually, Mother, I've decided -
- Oh, Louis! Louis, you know Sam.

679
00:55:18,458 --> 00:55:20,858
Can you believe it?

680
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,758
It's just me and my little knife.

681
00:55:23,863 --> 00:55:26,764
- Snip, snip, slice, slice.
- It's marvelous.

682
00:55:26,866 --> 00:55:29,767
- Can you believe it?
- Congratulations.

683
00:55:29,869 --> 00:55:32,565
- But this is just the beginning.
- Oh, really?

684
00:55:32,672 --> 00:55:35,664
Oh, Christ, yes.
You've seen her with her clothes off.

685
00:55:35,775 --> 00:55:38,972
Faces are a doddle
compared to tits and ass.

686
00:55:39,078 --> 00:55:42,047
- No hairline.
- Oh, really, Louis!

687
00:55:43,516 --> 00:55:45,984
I've been looking foryou
eveywhere, Ida.

688
00:55:50,523 --> 00:55:53,424
Mother. Mother, I have to
talk to Mr. Helpmann.

689
00:55:53,526 --> 00:55:57,155
- Oh, you stupid sod.
- Dear boy.

690
00:55:57,263 --> 00:55:59,527
What do you think ofyour mother now?

691
00:55:59,632 --> 00:56:01,600
It'll neverlast.

692
00:56:03,937 --> 00:56:05,837
Excuse me.

693
00:56:05,939 --> 00:56:08,464
Dr. Chapman,
did you say something?

694
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:10,542
That technique - I 've tried it.

695
00:56:10,643 --> 00:56:14,044
Oh, nice effect,
but highly unstable.

696
00:56:14,147 --> 00:56:18,345
In six months
she'll look like Grandma Moses.

697
00:56:18,451 --> 00:56:23,354
Now, see here, Chapman, at least mine
don't end up looking like they've been mugged.

698
00:56:23,456 --> 00:56:26,050
Sam! Sam!

699
00:56:28,161 --> 00:56:33,030
What have you done with his body?

700
00:56:33,132 --> 00:56:35,828
Sam!

701
00:56:35,935 --> 00:56:37,334
Sam?

702
00:56:37,437 --> 00:56:41,339
- What on earth's happened to you?
- There was a little complication.

703
00:56:41,441 --> 00:56:46,640
Dr. Chapman says it often happens
with a delicate skin like mine.

704
00:56:46,746 --> 00:56:48,646
Nothing to worry about.

705
00:56:48,748 --> 00:56:52,206
He's promised me these bandages
will be off in a jiffy.

706
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:55,151
- Actually, there's someone I want to meet.
- Oh, I know.

707
00:56:55,254 --> 00:56:57,552
I know.

708
00:56:59,859 --> 00:57:02,327
There we are.

709
00:57:02,428 --> 00:57:06,159
I'm going to leave
you two lovebirds in peace.

710
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:09,533
Hello, Shirley.

711
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:13,127
- Oh, God.
- Come on!

712
00:57:13,239 --> 00:57:15,207
Do you want a drink?

713
00:57:17,944 --> 00:57:20,276
Oh. Hello.

714
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:23,281
- Chase those years away!

715
00:57:23,383 --> 00:57:25,749
Listen, Shirley...

716
00:57:25,852 --> 00:57:29,913
your mother and my mother,
they seem to have got the idea that -

717
00:57:30,023 --> 00:57:32,423
Look, I'm very flattered
and, uh, well...

718
00:57:32,525 --> 00:57:35,426
I just don't want you to be
under any false impressions.

719
00:57:35,528 --> 00:57:37,428
It's all right.

720
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:39,828
I don't like you either.

721
00:57:41,401 --> 00:57:43,369
Sam!

722
00:57:44,203 --> 00:57:46,501
Jack.
Excuse me, Shirley.

723
00:57:46,606 --> 00:57:50,303
- I'm s - I'm sorry.

724
00:57:51,344 --> 00:57:54,711
- Sam! You remember Alison?
- Evening.

725
00:57:54,814 --> 00:57:57,510
Alison. Sam Lowry.
Old friend.

726
00:57:57,617 --> 00:57:59,847
Alison, yes, of course.

727
00:57:59,952 --> 00:58:02,853
- You look different.
- Well, I'm two years older.

728
00:58:02,955 --> 00:58:05,082
- And she's been to Dr. Jaffe.
- Ah.

729
00:58:05,191 --> 00:58:08,217
She doesn't like me telling people,
but, in fact, she's really pleased.

730
00:58:08,327 --> 00:58:12,058
- I knew there was something different.
- Remember how they used to stick out?

731
00:58:12,165 --> 00:58:16,226
What? Oh, yes.
Uh, well, rather.

732
00:58:16,335 --> 00:58:19,634
- Always used to wonder if they were real.
- What, my ears?

733
00:58:21,007 --> 00:58:22,907
Sorry?

734
00:58:23,009 --> 00:58:25,136
Dr. Jaffe pinned her ears back.

735
00:58:25,244 --> 00:58:27,144
Yes, that's what I -

736
00:58:27,246 --> 00:58:29,510
Always used to wonder
if she wore falsies.

737
00:58:29,615 --> 00:58:31,879
Ah! Mr. Helpmann.

738
00:58:31,984 --> 00:58:34,851
False ears -
Mr. Helpmann!

739
00:58:35,021 --> 00:58:37,581
- Hello,Jack.
- You remember my wife, Alison?

740
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:39,590
Yes, of course.
Barbara, isn't it?

741
00:58:39,692 --> 00:58:41,592
- How are you?
- Well, actuall -

742
00:58:41,694 --> 00:58:44,595
Barbara's very well, thankyou, sir.
Very well indeed. How are you?

743
00:58:44,697 --> 00:58:46,597
- Fine, thanks.
- Good.

744
00:58:46,699 --> 00:58:50,226
Hello, Sam. Ida said you might be here.
Have you got a minute?

745
00:58:50,336 --> 00:58:53,237
- Would you excuse us?
- Oh, no, of course.

746
00:58:53,339 --> 00:58:55,967
Of course.
Come on, Alison - Barbara.

747
00:58:57,443 --> 00:58:59,411
Sam.

748
00:59:02,582 --> 00:59:04,550
I need your help.

749
00:59:26,506 --> 00:59:29,066
Thanks very much, Sam.

750
00:59:29,175 --> 00:59:31,803
Mr. Helpmann,
I'm glad to be of help.

751
00:59:31,911 --> 00:59:35,472
- If I can help you -
- Ah, well, actually -

752
00:59:35,581 --> 00:59:37,572
Oh.

753
00:59:40,153 --> 00:59:43,054
Your father and I were very close.

754
00:59:43,156 --> 00:59:47,490
Of course,Jeremiah was senior to me,
but we were close friends.

755
00:59:47,593 --> 00:59:50,027
Especially after the bombing.

756
00:59:51,197 --> 00:59:54,963
And I keep his name alive
at the office every day.

757
00:59:56,002 --> 00:59:58,664
It's as though he's there
still speaking to me.

758
00:59:58,771 --> 01:00:02,172
"'Ere I am.

759
01:00:02,275 --> 01:00:04,869
J.H."

760
01:00:06,512 --> 01:00:08,639
The ghost in the machine.

761
01:00:11,017 --> 01:00:14,475
I know he would have
wanted me to help you.

762
01:00:16,522 --> 01:00:18,922
And I promised your mother...

763
01:00:19,025 --> 01:00:23,428
that I'd take you on to the team
at Information Retrieval.

764
01:00:23,529 --> 01:00:25,861
But I gather that, um -

765
01:00:25,965 --> 01:00:30,698
Well, actually, Mr. Helpmann, I've, uh -
I've changed my mind.

766
01:00:30,803 --> 01:00:34,102
I've decided I'd accept the transfer...

767
01:00:34,207 --> 01:00:36,175
if I'm not too late.

768
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:39,110
Too late?

769
01:00:39,212 --> 01:00:41,271
That's for me to say.

770
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:43,848
Well - Well, then, I, uh -

771
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:49,187
Welcome to Information Retrieval.

772
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:40,548
Uh, my name's Lowry.

773
01:01:41,716 --> 01:01:43,707
Sam Lowry.

774
01:01:43,819 --> 01:01:47,220
I've been told to report
to Mr. Warrenn.

775
01:01:47,322 --> 01:01:49,449
Thirtieth floor, sir.

776
01:01:49,558 --> 01:01:51,526
You're expected.

777
01:01:53,195 --> 01:01:57,097
Um, don't you want to search me?

778
01:01:57,199 --> 01:01:59,167
No, sir.

779
01:02:00,435 --> 01:02:03,063
- Want to see my I.D.?
- No need, sir.

780
01:02:05,273 --> 01:02:08,504
- But I could be anybody.
- No, you couldn't, sir.

781
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:11,511
This is Information Retrieval.

782
01:02:11,613 --> 01:02:14,741
- The lift's arrived, sir.

783
01:03:34,413 --> 01:03:37,905
- I want that order rescinded!

784
01:03:59,304 --> 01:04:01,329
- Half as terrorists, the rest as victims.

785
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,101
Yes. No.

786
01:04:03,208 --> 01:04:04,937
Definitely no!

787
01:04:05,043 --> 01:04:07,739
- My name's Lowry, Mr. Warrenn. Sam Lowry.
- Ah, Lowry!

788
01:04:07,846 --> 01:04:12,340
- Yes. No. Cancel that. Okay.

789
01:04:12,451 --> 01:04:14,885
- Glad to have you aboard. Yes.
- These requisitions -

790
01:04:14,987 --> 01:04:18,013
- Sir, I'd like to point this out -
- No! Don't be ridiculous,Jenkins.

791
01:04:18,123 --> 01:04:20,614
- About these invoices -
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

792
01:04:20,726 --> 01:04:22,887
You'll like it up here.
Send that back.

793
01:04:22,995 --> 01:04:26,158
We've got a crack team of -
Are they kidding? Decision makers.

794
01:04:26,265 --> 01:04:28,165
No, in triplicate.

795
01:04:28,267 --> 01:04:30,735
I'm expecting big things -
Two copies to Financial!

796
01:04:30,836 --> 01:04:34,738
No. No.
Don't let Progress see those.

797
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:38,435
Between you and me, Lowry, this - No, no!
department - Tell Records to get stuffed!

798
01:04:38,544 --> 01:04:40,444
is about to be upgraded and -

799
01:04:40,546 --> 01:04:44,312
Ah! Here we are.

800
01:04:44,416 --> 01:04:47,647
Your very own number
on your very own door.

801
01:04:47,753 --> 01:04:50,654
And behind that door,
your very own office.

802
01:04:50,756 --> 01:04:53,657
Congratulations, DZ/015.

803
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,784
Welcome to the team.

804
01:04:55,894 --> 01:04:58,260
Yes! No! Cancel that!

805
01:04:58,363 --> 01:05:00,627
Send two copies to Financial!

806
01:06:28,626 --> 01:06:30,526
Well, you can't borrow any more chairs!

807
01:06:30,628 --> 01:06:33,188
There's only one left in here now,
and I need that to sit on!

808
01:06:33,297 --> 01:06:34,889
What?

809
01:06:34,999 --> 01:06:37,024
Oh.

810
01:06:37,135 --> 01:06:39,695
Sorry.

811
01:06:39,804 --> 01:06:41,863
Who are you?

812
01:06:41,973 --> 01:06:44,373
My name's Lowry.
Sam Lowry.

813
01:06:44,475 --> 01:06:47,774
Oh, yes.
The new boy from next door.

814
01:06:48,813 --> 01:06:51,714
My name's Lime.
Harvey Lime.

815
01:06:51,816 --> 01:06:53,716
Welcome to Expediting.

816
01:06:53,818 --> 01:06:56,719
I say, look, would you mind
if I borrowed your computer console?

817
01:06:56,821 --> 01:06:59,722
- What?
- Yes, I'll let you have it back in 10 minutes.

818
01:06:59,824 --> 01:07:03,419
You want to take my console
into your office?

819
01:07:03,528 --> 01:07:05,428
Yes. Just for a few minutes.

820
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:07,555
I-I'll tell you what.

821
01:07:07,665 --> 01:07:09,656
You tell me what you want...

822
01:07:09,767 --> 01:07:11,928
and I'll do it foryou.

823
01:07:12,036 --> 01:07:14,334
I'm a bit of a whiz on that thing.

824
01:07:14,439 --> 01:07:16,339
Um...

825
01:07:16,441 --> 01:07:18,341
all right.

826
01:07:18,443 --> 01:07:22,277
Uh, I need some information
on a woman named Layton.

827
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:24,348
A woman, eh?

828
01:07:24,449 --> 01:07:26,747
- I see.
- Yes.

829
01:07:26,851 --> 01:07:30,480
I know her age and distinguishing marks,
but I need an address or a place ofwork.

830
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:33,489
This your dream girl, is it?

831
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:35,752
What? Um -

832
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:37,919
Look, let me use your console.

833
01:07:38,029 --> 01:07:39,929
You must be joking.

834
01:07:40,031 --> 01:07:45,025
When there's a woman involved,
there's no stopping me.

835
01:07:45,136 --> 01:07:47,104
Let's have that sheet.

836
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:58,048
Sod it! It's broken!

837
01:07:58,149 --> 01:08:00,117
You haven't switched it on.

838
01:08:01,385 --> 01:08:03,353
Oh, yes.

839
01:08:06,924 --> 01:08:08,824
Look, you're putting me off standing there.

840
01:08:08,926 --> 01:08:12,953
- Why don't you go back to your office
and I 'll give you a knock when I'm finished.
- Um -

841
01:08:13,064 --> 01:08:15,396
Go on. I'm not going to elope with her.

842
01:08:16,901 --> 01:08:18,869
All right.

843
01:08:53,971 --> 01:08:56,701
Sam!

844
01:09:18,496 --> 01:09:21,090
Sam.

845
01:09:22,834 --> 01:09:24,802
Don't go.

846
01:09:26,404 --> 01:09:28,929
Please.

847
01:09:40,585 --> 01:09:42,746
Well?

848
01:09:42,854 --> 01:09:45,254
Computers are my forte.

849
01:09:45,356 --> 01:09:47,256
Let me see.

850
01:09:47,358 --> 01:09:51,454
"Jillian Layton. Coloring: white.
Hair: blonde. Eyes: blue. Height: 5 foot 4.

851
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:54,224
Distinguishing marks:
scar on left" -

852
01:09:54,332 --> 01:09:56,232
Is this all you've got?

853
01:09:56,334 --> 01:10:00,236
Best to take things slowly
where some women are concerned.

854
01:10:00,338 --> 01:10:02,306
- Let me see.

855
01:10:02,406 --> 01:10:05,341
- Hey! That's mine!

856
01:10:06,377 --> 01:10:08,277
"Layton.

857
01:10:08,379 --> 01:10:10,279
"Truck driver.

858
01:10:10,381 --> 01:10:14,977
All inquiries, reference office
of 412/L, room 5001."

859
01:11:26,451 --> 01:11:29,784
- Can I help you?

860
01:11:29,887 --> 01:11:33,379
No! No! No! Please!

861
01:11:33,491 --> 01:11:37,325
- I 'm, uh - I 'm looking for Officer 412/L.

862
01:11:37,428 --> 01:11:39,896
He won't be very long now.

863
01:11:40,932 --> 01:11:44,459
- Hmm. I thought so.

864
01:11:49,394 --> 01:11:52,022
You may go in now.

865
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:05,135
Excuse me.
Are you Officer 412/L?

866
01:12:11,543 --> 01:12:13,511
Excuse me!

867
01:12:14,846 --> 01:12:16,541
Jack.

868
01:12:16,648 --> 01:12:18,639
Sam.

869
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:21,514
- Ah! I heard you were coming aboard.

870
01:12:21,619 --> 01:12:25,646
Congratulations, "DZ/015."

871
01:12:25,757 --> 01:12:27,782
Thanks.
Are you Officer 412/L?

872
01:12:27,892 --> 01:12:30,292
Uh-huh. That's me.

873
01:12:30,395 --> 01:12:33,694
Oh, and, Sam,
a very happy Christmas.

874
01:12:33,798 --> 01:12:35,698
- Thanks, Jack.
- Are you settling in all right?

875
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:39,133
Yes, fine.Jack, I -
I need some information.

876
01:12:39,237 --> 01:12:42,297
Oh, Sam, this is Information Retrieval,
not Information Dispersal.

877
01:12:42,407 --> 01:12:44,307
- Hey! Amy!

878
01:12:44,409 --> 01:12:46,309
Don't throw the ball around in here.

879
01:12:46,411 --> 01:12:48,311
I'm not Amy. I'm Holly.

880
01:12:48,413 --> 01:12:50,438
Did I call you Amy, darling?
I'm sorry.

881
01:12:50,548 --> 01:12:52,482
- A triplet?
- One of them, I think.

882
01:12:52,584 --> 01:12:55,451
Barbara's taken the other two
Christmas shopping.

883
01:12:56,298 --> 01:12:58,994
- Jack.
- Now bring me the blue one over there.

884
01:12:59,101 --> 01:13:00,001
I need to find out about a woman.

885
01:13:00,303 --> 01:13:04,330
Come on, Chloe, let's show Uncle Sam here
how we can make the word "cat." Shall we?

886
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:07,000
- I 'm Holly.
- Sorry, love. So you are.

887
01:13:07,109 --> 01:13:09,077
- Cat.
- This is her.

888
01:13:10,346 --> 01:13:12,246
Layton.

889
01:13:12,348 --> 01:13:14,316
Oh, shit.

890
01:13:15,852 --> 01:13:18,013
- How much do you know about this?
- Uh, not much.

891
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,554
What does B58/732 mean to you?

892
01:13:20,656 --> 01:13:23,557
- Buttle.
- I knew it.

893
01:13:23,659 --> 01:13:26,822
You always were bloody quick, Sam.

894
01:13:26,929 --> 01:13:30,296
Who else knows?
Warrenn? Helpmann?

895
01:13:30,399 --> 01:13:32,629
I don't know.
I only know you got the wrong man.

896
01:13:32,735 --> 01:13:35,636
Information Transit got the wrong man.

897
01:13:35,738 --> 01:13:37,638
I got the right man.

898
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:40,140
The wrong man was delivered to me
as the right man.

899
01:13:40,243 --> 01:13:43,644
I accepted him on good faith
as the right man. Was I wrong?

900
01:13:43,746 --> 01:13:45,646
You killed Buttle?

901
01:13:46,749 --> 01:13:51,311
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down
to prevent such things happening.

902
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:54,787
It wasn't my fault that Buttle's heart condition
didn't appear on Tuttle's file.

903
01:13:54,891 --> 01:13:56,791
Come and look.

904
01:13:56,093 --> 01:13:59,062
- Jack.

905
01:13:59,162 --> 01:14:01,392
- I really need to know about -
- Tuttle?

906
01:14:01,498 --> 01:14:04,160
Well, we're gonna have to bring
Mr. Tuttle in, aren't we?

907
01:14:04,267 --> 01:14:07,168
And interrogate him
at the same voltage as Mr. Buttle.

908
01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:09,170
And juggle the books
in Electrical Banking.

909
01:14:09,272 --> 01:14:13,368
- What has Tuttle done?
- We suspect him of, uh, freelance subversion.

910
01:14:14,053 --> 01:14:16,988
Then all I need to wrap up the case
is the Layton woman.

911
01:14:17,090 --> 01:14:18,990
What has she done?

912
01:14:19,092 --> 01:14:21,856
Well, she witnessed the Tuttle -
Um, the Buttle arrest.

913
01:14:21,961 --> 01:14:24,327
Since then, she's been going around
making wild allegations...

914
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:26,864
obviously trying to exploit the situation.

915
01:14:26,966 --> 01:14:29,230
She's working for someone,
and I don't think it's us.

916
01:14:29,335 --> 01:14:32,031
- That's it. Overthere, love.
- Terrorist?

917
01:14:34,474 --> 01:14:36,704
Mr. Lint, the next customer has been delivered.

918
01:14:36,809 --> 01:14:38,172
- Thank you, Myrtle.

919
01:14:38,361 --> 01:14:41,728
Jack, why don't I
try and get to her for you?

920
01:14:41,832 --> 01:14:44,801
I 'll, um - I 'll deactivate her.

921
01:14:44,901 --> 01:14:48,496
What does that mean, Sam? I don't want
to get involved in anything unsavory.

922
01:14:48,605 --> 01:14:50,232
Trust me, Jack.

923
01:14:51,275 --> 01:14:54,335
- Come on, darling. Put these away now.
Mummy'll be here soon.
- Let me have her file.

924
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:58,848
Look, trust me, Jack.

925
01:15:00,217 --> 01:15:03,084
All right.
Come on here.

926
01:15:03,187 --> 01:15:07,180
All right, but for Christ's sake,
don't lose it.

927
01:15:07,291 --> 01:15:09,816
All right.

928
01:15:09,927 --> 01:15:12,122
You sit down there, Mary.
Sam.

929
01:15:12,229 --> 01:15:14,197
Don't worry.
I 'll get to her.

930
01:15:14,298 --> 01:15:16,596
You'll never get anywhere
in a suit like that.

931
01:15:18,369 --> 01:15:20,064
Here.

932
01:15:21,105 --> 01:15:23,335
Try this.

933
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,840
- Bye-bye.
- Bye!

934
01:15:25,943 --> 01:15:28,109
Uh, but, Jack, I -

935
01:15:28,506 --> 01:15:32,670
Put it on, big boy.
I won't look at your willy.

936
01:15:42,921 --> 01:15:45,412
Oh, let him go.

937
01:15:53,532 --> 01:15:56,433
- Trier, isn't he?

938
01:16:28,143 --> 01:16:32,773
Just - I've been to
the department of -

939
01:16:50,634 --> 01:16:54,627
But you've stamped this form before.
Why won't you stamp it now?

940
01:16:54,738 --> 01:16:58,230
You just said yourself, miss -
we've already stamped it.

941
01:17:06,983 --> 01:17:10,384
No, no! Stop!

942
01:17:10,487 --> 01:17:13,388
Up! Up! Up! Up! Up!

943
01:17:15,525 --> 01:17:17,959
Oh, God.

944
01:17:18,061 --> 01:17:20,029
Come on!

945
01:17:22,966 --> 01:17:24,490
Shit!

946
01:17:34,766 --> 01:17:37,166
Oi!
Come out of there.

947
01:17:37,269 --> 01:17:39,036
- What?
- That's the deputy minister's lift.

948
01:17:39,339 --> 01:17:42,399
- I'm sorry. I'm in a hurry.
- Oi, come here.

949
01:17:42,508 --> 01:17:45,409
Come here, sonny.
Let's see your I.D. card, eh?

950
01:17:45,511 --> 01:17:48,512
My I.D.? Oh, God.

951
01:17:48,715 --> 01:17:49,615
This isn't my suit.

952
01:17:49,833 --> 01:17:51,202
Look, really, can't this wait?

953
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:56,010
No, sir. I 'm going to have to
fill in a report on this.

954
01:17:56,114 --> 01:17:57,015
Now, then, uh -

955
01:17:57,305 --> 01:18:00,297
Oi! Oi, you! Stop!
Come back here! Stop!

956
01:18:23,631 --> 01:18:26,429
Aim!

957
01:18:30,671 --> 01:18:32,571
Stop! Don't -

958
01:18:32,673 --> 01:18:34,573
- Up!

959
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:49,521
Well done, men.
Quick thinking.

960
01:18:49,624 --> 01:18:51,524
- Excellent work.

961
01:18:51,626 --> 01:18:55,528
Um - I'll take charge of her now.

962
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:57,530
Good. Good man.

963
01:18:57,632 --> 01:19:00,032
Um, okay.

964
01:19:00,134 --> 01:19:03,501
Uh - It's a...

965
01:19:04,739 --> 01:19:06,434
classified matter...

966
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:08,907
and, um, I'll, uh -

967
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:13,071
I'll include your fine handling
of the situation in my report.

968
01:19:13,181 --> 01:19:15,149
Great.

969
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:19,284
Uh, merry Christmas, Dawson.

970
01:19:19,387 --> 01:19:23,289
Come along with me, please.
Please? Okay. Yes.

971
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:25,723
Well done, men. Excellent.

972
01:19:25,827 --> 01:19:28,455
Good turnout. Nice.
Very good. Thankyou.

973
01:19:30,231 --> 01:19:33,359
No, no, no. This way, please.
Straight ahead.

974
01:19:48,616 --> 01:19:49,516
Just keep moving.

975
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:51,452
- Hey! Stop!

976
01:19:52,221 --> 01:19:54,018
Come back here!

977
01:19:54,123 --> 01:19:55,818
Pick up all these things!

978
01:19:55,925 --> 01:19:59,019
- Come on! Pick them up!
- Geez - Oh -

979
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:01,722
- Disgraceful!

980
01:20:01,831 --> 01:20:03,856
- Can't you read English?
- Ow! Get your -

981
01:20:06,978 --> 01:20:09,344
- Oh, God.

982
01:20:10,448 --> 01:20:12,882
Stop!

983
01:20:23,594 --> 01:20:26,392
That's it! Let's go!
Vroom! Vroom!

984
01:20:30,434 --> 01:20:33,733
What are you doing?
For Christ's sake, keep moving!

985
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,733
- Get out of my cab.
- What?

986
01:20:37,842 --> 01:20:39,810
Just drive!

987
01:20:41,112 --> 01:20:43,012
You touched me.
Nobody touches me.

988
01:20:43,114 --> 01:20:45,309
What are you - Oh, God!

989
01:20:45,416 --> 01:20:47,316
Please! Please! Drive on!

990
01:20:47,418 --> 01:20:50,319
Drive on, will you! For -
Oh, shit. Move over. I 'll drive.

991
01:20:50,421 --> 01:20:53,686
- Don't touch that! Don't touch anything!

992
01:20:56,260 --> 01:21:00,560
It's okay, Officer. Thankyou. It's okay.
Got everything under control. Thankyou.

993
01:21:00,665 --> 01:21:02,895
Oh, shit. They're coming.

994
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:07,061
Listen, please drive. Drive.
Trust me. You are in terrible danger.

995
01:21:07,171 --> 01:21:09,332
You are an embarrassment.
Please.

996
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,431
Please drive.
Trust me. Trust me.

997
01:21:11,542 --> 01:21:13,806
Drive, and I'll explain everything.

998
01:21:13,911 --> 01:21:15,811
Please...

999
01:21:15,913 --> 01:21:17,904
get out of my cab.

1000
01:21:19,183 --> 01:21:21,549
- I 'm sorry. I -
- Okay!

1001
01:21:21,652 --> 01:21:23,552
Okay, you've asked for it!

1002
01:21:23,654 --> 01:21:25,918
I 'm Information Retrieval Officer D -

1003
01:21:26,023 --> 01:21:27,923
DZ/1 05!

1004
01:21:28,025 --> 01:21:30,255
And I 'm arresting you as a -

1005
01:21:30,361 --> 01:21:33,489
Drive on, or I 'll blast
your fucking head off!.

1006
01:21:36,033 --> 01:21:38,001
Go!

1007
01:21:56,554 --> 01:21:58,954
Look, I 'm, uh - I'm sorry about that.

1008
01:21:59,056 --> 01:22:01,286
I mean, uh, touching you
without permission.

1009
01:22:01,392 --> 01:22:03,952
But, um - Hello.

1010
01:22:04,061 --> 01:22:06,655
My name is Lowry.
Sam Lowry.

1011
01:22:06,764 --> 01:22:08,959
I - I'm - I've been, uh -

1012
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:16,972
You won't believe this,
and I know it's going to sound incredible...

1013
01:22:17,074 --> 01:22:20,168
but, um - but I've been
dreaming about you.

1014
01:22:21,212 --> 01:22:23,840
No, not like that. I mean, I love you.

1015
01:22:24,615 --> 01:22:27,448
in my dreams I love you.

1016
01:22:27,551 --> 01:22:31,510
And, uh -
I mean - Extraordinary, isn't it?

1017
01:22:36,227 --> 01:22:38,787
Anyway, um...

1018
01:22:38,896 --> 01:22:40,796
y-y-you-

1019
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,630
You don't believe me, do you?

1020
01:22:45,736 --> 01:22:47,636
You, um -

1021
01:22:47,738 --> 01:22:52,198
You probably think I-I-I-I'm bonkers, right?
Mad. Raving.

1022
01:22:53,878 --> 01:22:57,644
No! No, I think
you're very attractive.

1023
01:22:58,749 --> 01:23:00,182
What?

1024
01:23:01,285 --> 01:23:04,379
Yeah. Yeah, sit back.
Let me have a look at you.

1025
01:23:12,263 --> 01:23:14,527
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1026
01:23:14,632 --> 01:23:18,033
Good-looking, sexy.
ust my type.

1027
01:23:19,904 --> 01:23:22,566
I don't believe you.

1028
01:23:22,673 --> 01:23:24,231
Why not?

1029
01:23:24,341 --> 01:23:28,175
Well, I-I - I just don't deserve
such terrific luck.

1030
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:31,309
Damn right.

1031
01:23:56,507 --> 01:23:58,407
Help!

1032
01:24:33,143 --> 01:24:36,544
- I love -

1033
01:25:17,388 --> 01:25:20,516
You don't trust me, do you?

1034
01:25:20,624 --> 01:25:23,923
Oh!

1035
01:25:55,092 --> 01:25:57,993
Oh, my God.
We shouldn't have come here.

1036
01:25:58,095 --> 01:26:00,495
I got a job to do!

1037
01:26:00,597 --> 01:26:03,998
- But they'll be lying in wait.
- Oh, Christ, you're paranoid.

1038
01:26:04,101 --> 01:26:06,501
You've got no sense of reality.

1039
01:26:06,603 --> 01:26:08,901
Wait, wait, wait! Wait!

1040
01:26:12,409 --> 01:26:14,741
We should take the lorry
and get away!

1041
01:26:14,845 --> 01:26:17,746
- Yeah? Where to?
- Anywhere, as fast as possible.

1042
01:26:17,848 --> 01:26:20,749
- There isn't anywhere!
- Just far away!

1043
01:26:20,851 --> 01:26:22,751
That's not far enough!

1044
01:26:22,853 --> 01:26:24,821
But - Wait!

1045
01:26:39,003 --> 01:26:40,903
Jill!

1046
01:27:31,091 --> 01:27:33,218
What's in the, uh, parcel?

1047
01:27:34,461 --> 01:27:36,622
- Christmas present.
- Oh.

1048
01:27:44,471 --> 01:27:46,666
It's heavy.

1049
01:27:46,774 --> 01:27:48,901
Heavy Christmas present.

1050
01:27:49,009 --> 01:27:51,170
- You don't trust me, open it.
- No!

1051
01:27:51,278 --> 01:27:53,803
No, no, it's, uh - it's fine.

1052
01:27:55,048 --> 01:27:57,312
I'd spoil the wrapping.

1053
01:27:57,417 --> 01:28:01,285
Anyway, if I want you to trust me,
then it's only fair that I should trust you. Right?

1054
01:28:09,163 --> 01:28:12,929
Doesn't it botheryou, the sort of things
you do at Information Retrieval?

1055
01:28:13,033 --> 01:28:15,001
What?

1056
01:28:16,136 --> 01:28:18,696
I suppose you'd rather
have terrorists.

1057
01:28:18,806 --> 01:28:21,536
- Here's one now.

1058
01:28:22,876 --> 01:28:27,142
How many terrorists have you met, Sam?
Actual terrorists?

1059
01:28:29,449 --> 01:28:31,417
- Actual terrorists?
- Yeah.

1060
01:28:35,155 --> 01:28:37,749
Well -
It's only my first day.

1061
01:28:47,649 --> 01:28:50,618
- Uh-oh.
- A roadblock.

1062
01:28:52,621 --> 01:28:54,680
- What are we gonna do?
- Stay calm.

1063
01:28:54,789 --> 01:28:56,689
Don't slow down.
Don't slow down!

1064
01:28:56,791 --> 01:28:59,453
Don't stop. Please.
Please do as I say. Go.

1065
01:28:59,561 --> 01:29:01,722
Go! Straight ahead! Go!

1066
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:05,527
- Go! Go! Go!
- What are you doing, you stupid asshole?

1067
01:29:10,438 --> 01:29:11,905
Whoo!

1068
01:29:17,513 --> 01:29:19,413
We did it! We did it!

1069
01:29:19,515 --> 01:29:22,951
We broke right through!
We did it! Whee, whee, whee, whee!

1070
01:29:28,390 --> 01:29:31,291
- Faster! Don't let them see you! Just go!
- Get off of me!

1071
01:29:34,529 --> 01:29:37,430
Keep going! Keep going! Faster!

1072
01:29:37,532 --> 01:29:40,968
- Get your foot down on it! Move!
- Stay off of it!

1073
01:29:49,828 --> 01:29:52,695
- No!

1074
01:29:54,794 --> 01:29:57,262
- Get off!.

1075
01:30:05,037 --> 01:30:08,404
- Shit!

1076
01:30:10,409 --> 01:30:11,603
Oh, no.

1077
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:16,575
Faster! Faster!

1078
01:30:22,588 --> 01:30:25,887
- What if we lose the house, yeah?
- Don't touch anything!

1079
01:30:27,093 --> 01:30:29,687
Don't touch it!

1080
01:30:51,550 --> 01:30:56,453
We did it! We did it!
We did it! We did it!

1081
01:31:02,762 --> 01:31:04,730
Oh, no.

1082
01:31:18,577 --> 01:31:21,205
And what would you like for Christmas?

1083
01:31:21,313 --> 01:31:23,679
My own credit card.

1084
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:30,088
Hmm.

1085
01:31:34,226 --> 01:31:36,456
- Why have we come here?
- Go away!

1086
01:31:36,562 --> 01:31:39,963
- Look, why don't we go back to my flat.
- Forget it.

1087
01:31:40,065 --> 01:31:42,465
- You don't trust me?
- Trust you? Trust you?

1088
01:31:42,568 --> 01:31:44,798
A man who hijacks my truck,
loses me my job...

1089
01:31:44,904 --> 01:31:46,735
has every security man in town
looking for me?

1090
01:31:46,839 --> 01:31:48,807
- Of course I trust you.
- I was only trying to help.

1091
01:31:48,908 --> 01:31:50,808
- Yeah!
- Okay. Okay.

1092
01:31:50,910 --> 01:31:52,810
You don't trust me, I don't trust you.

1093
01:31:52,912 --> 01:31:54,812
- What's in that parcel?
- Oh,Jesus.

1094
01:31:54,914 --> 01:31:57,712
You saved it from the lorry.
It must be something very special.

1095
01:31:57,817 --> 01:32:00,718
I saved you from the lorry.
You're not something "very special."

1096
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:03,220
- How can you - I'm gonna open it.
- Don't touch that!

1097
01:32:12,464 --> 01:32:15,922
Sam! It's me!

1098
01:32:16,035 --> 01:32:18,003
And Shirley!

1099
01:32:20,139 --> 01:32:22,107
Mrs. Terrain.

1100
01:32:25,144 --> 01:32:27,738
- That should hold it.
- Sam?

1101
01:32:27,847 --> 01:32:30,372
Hello, Shirley.

1102
01:32:32,785 --> 01:32:35,049
My God, what on earth's
happened to you now?

1103
01:32:35,154 --> 01:32:38,885
My complication
had a little complication.

1104
01:32:38,991 --> 01:32:42,950
But Dr. Chapman
says I'll soon be up...

1105
01:32:43,062 --> 01:32:46,395
and bounding about
like a young gazelle.

1106
01:32:46,498 --> 01:32:49,092
You buying a Christmas present
for your mother?

1107
01:32:49,201 --> 01:32:51,101
What?

1108
01:32:51,203 --> 01:32:54,070
Oh, um, yes.
A I ittle something.

1109
01:32:54,173 --> 01:32:57,768
Shirley and I come here
"wegularlarly."

1110
01:32:58,844 --> 01:33:00,937
We love romantic lingerie.

1111
01:33:01,046 --> 01:33:03,276
- Really?

1112
01:33:03,382 --> 01:33:07,478
- Sam, picture me in these.

1113
01:33:12,725 --> 01:33:15,626
- Oh, my God.
- Sam, where are you going?

1114
01:33:15,728 --> 01:33:19,596
- Sam! Sam!

1115
01:33:21,615 --> 01:33:23,480
Jill!

1116
01:33:40,605 --> 01:33:42,505
Are you all right?

1117
01:33:46,023 --> 01:33:47,991
Well, you don't deserve to be!

1118
01:33:48,092 --> 01:33:51,118
What a bloody stupid thing!

1119
01:33:51,228 --> 01:33:54,561
How could you?
Look at these people! My God!

1120
01:33:54,665 --> 01:33:57,429
It was a bomb.
It was a bomb.

1121
01:33:57,534 --> 01:34:00,435
I should have opened it.
I sat there with it next - I -

1122
01:34:00,537 --> 01:34:02,528
What a stupid thing.

1123
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:04,573
There's your bomb, asshole!

1124
01:34:08,545 --> 01:34:10,445
Bribes...

1125
01:34:10,547 --> 01:34:12,606
for official monkeys like you.

1126
01:34:12,716 --> 01:34:15,116
Oh.

1127
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:18,714
Go on.
Make yourself useful.

1128
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:25,857
- Here.

1129
01:34:27,459 --> 01:34:30,895
- Don't touch her! She's hurt!

1130
01:34:30,996 --> 01:34:32,193
- Damn it!

1131
01:34:32,853 --> 01:34:35,481
- Don't touch her!
- No!

1132
01:34:38,359 --> 01:34:40,190
Stop!

1133
01:34:47,501 --> 01:34:49,935
Sam, no! Sam! Behind you!

1134
01:36:42,010 --> 01:36:44,911
These helmets don't half
make your scalp itch.

1135
01:36:45,013 --> 01:36:48,540
Oh, don't mention it.
And they make you sweat.

1136
01:36:48,650 --> 01:36:50,551
Half the time
I can't ever see where I'm going.

1137
01:36:51,144 --> 01:36:52,544
Well, I'm lucky.

1138
01:36:52,846 --> 01:36:54,746
I got these thick eyebrows.

1139
01:36:54,848 --> 01:36:58,340
That keeps it up
and channels it out to the ears.

1140
01:36:58,452 --> 01:37:00,352
Yeah. Who's he?

1141
01:37:00,454 --> 01:37:03,389
Oh, I don't know.
Somebody from Information Retrieval.

1142
01:37:03,490 --> 01:37:05,856
They're always hangin' around
in Lingerie.

1143
01:37:05,959 --> 01:37:09,451
Where is she? Huh?

1144
01:37:09,563 --> 01:37:11,531
Jill, is that you?

1145
01:37:11,632 --> 01:37:14,232
Uh - Excuse me, sir.
That is government property.

1146
01:37:14,661 --> 01:37:16,891
Oh, Jill.

1147
01:37:18,532 --> 01:37:20,727
Jill! Answer me!

1148
01:37:22,536 --> 01:37:25,027
I'm looking for a girl
with blonde hair.

1149
01:37:25,139 --> 01:37:27,767
She's medium height, green eyes.

1150
01:37:27,875 --> 01:37:31,242
I don't know, sir.
They check all that at the depot.

1151
01:37:31,345 --> 01:37:34,940
Uh, we can't allow that, sir.
It's more than our job's worth.

1152
01:37:35,049 --> 01:37:37,950
Jill!
Jill, you must be here! Jill!

1153
01:37:38,052 --> 01:37:41,385
Look, sir, you can fill in an application form,
sir, if you're a relative.

1154
01:37:41,489 --> 01:37:43,389
Now, do stop, sir. Please.

1155
01:37:43,491 --> 01:37:45,721
Jill? Jill?

1156
01:37:45,826 --> 01:37:47,726
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

1157
01:37:51,365 --> 01:37:54,994
Sorry about that, sir.
Regulations.

1158
01:38:00,774 --> 01:38:03,641
This is a black eye
for the department, Lowry.

1159
01:38:03,744 --> 01:38:05,974
I don't care how you behaved
when you were at Records.

1160
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:08,810
Information Retrieval
is an executive branch.

1161
01:38:08,916 --> 01:38:11,714
We're proud of our reputation
and we protect it.

1162
01:38:11,819 --> 01:38:15,721
Damn it, Lowry! That convoy of personnel
carriers is still not accounted for!

1163
01:38:15,823 --> 01:38:18,758
I thought I told you to deal with it.
And what the hell is this mess?

1164
01:38:18,859 --> 01:38:20,986
An empty desk is an efficient desk.

1165
01:38:21,095 --> 01:38:23,859
Good God.
Queries from Security.

1166
01:38:23,964 --> 01:38:26,125
Searches from Central Banking
about a check?

1167
01:38:26,233 --> 01:38:29,100
Clarification notices from Accounting
concerning unreturned receipts?

1168
01:38:29,203 --> 01:38:32,695
- Mr. Warrenn, I have to find out about -
- Get up!

1169
01:38:32,806 --> 01:38:36,173
I don't know what's going on here, Lowry.

1170
01:38:36,277 --> 01:38:41,442
But don't thinkyou can intimidate us
with your friends and relatives in high places.

1171
01:38:41,549 --> 01:38:44,712
- Now shape up!

1172
01:38:47,188 --> 01:38:50,089
Lime, I have to use your computer.

1173
01:38:50,191 --> 01:38:52,591
Sorry.
A bit busy at the moment.

1174
01:38:52,693 --> 01:38:55,662
You seem to have rather a lot
to get on with yourself.

1175
01:39:01,202 --> 01:39:04,365
- Shit.

1176
01:39:05,706 --> 01:39:07,606
Come off it, ack.

1177
01:39:07,708 --> 01:39:10,609
Of course you can check
to see if she's been arrested.

1178
01:39:10,711 --> 01:39:15,614
I 'm sorry, Sam. I 'm afraid this case has become
much more complicated since last we... talked.

1179
01:39:15,716 --> 01:39:18,776
But she's innocent,Jack.
She's done nothing wrong.

1180
01:39:18,886 --> 01:39:21,787
Tell that to the wives of the security men
she blew up this afternoon.

1181
01:39:21,889 --> 01:39:24,449
- She's not alone in all this.

1182
01:39:24,558 --> 01:39:27,618
We've just had a report in that Tuttle
has wrecked an entire flat...

1183
01:39:27,728 --> 01:39:30,128
and sabotaged
adjacent Central Services.

1184
01:39:30,231 --> 01:39:33,132
As a matter of fact,
it looks like on your block.

1185
01:39:33,234 --> 01:39:36,465
I should keep my eyes open
if I were you, Sam. Bye.

1186
01:39:37,571 --> 01:39:40,734
But, Jack, you don't really think Tuttle
and the girl are in league, do you?

1187
01:39:40,841 --> 01:39:41,540
I do.

1188
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:43,392
That's the beauty of it.

1189
01:39:43,786 --> 01:39:47,017
Our job is to trace the connections
and, uh, reveal them.

1190
01:39:49,191 --> 01:39:52,092
This whole Buttle-Tuttle confusion
was obviously planned from the inside.

1191
01:39:52,194 --> 01:39:54,094
Bye-bye.

1192
01:39:54,196 --> 01:39:56,426
Oh, but,Jack!

1193
01:39:56,532 --> 01:39:59,092
She's innocent,Jack.

1194
01:39:59,201 --> 01:40:02,102
Sam, we've always been close,
haven't we?

1195
01:40:02,204 --> 01:40:04,104
Yes, Jack?

1196
01:40:04,206 --> 01:40:07,664
Well, until this all blows over
just stay away from me.

1197
01:40:08,777 --> 01:40:10,745
But -

1198
01:42:10,001 --> 01:42:12,026
Oh, my God.

1199
01:42:14,706 --> 01:42:16,264
You.

1200
01:42:17,509 --> 01:42:20,444
It's you.
What's happening?

1201
01:42:20,545 --> 01:42:22,638
What's happening?

1202
01:42:22,747 --> 01:42:24,647
Your thermostat's gone,
and then some.

1203
01:42:24,749 --> 01:42:26,649
- And then some!

1204
01:42:27,131 --> 01:42:30,066
- As you don't live here anymore -
- What?

1205
01:42:30,167 --> 01:42:32,733
Absolutely.
Do you know what this is?

1206
01:42:32,841 --> 01:42:34,968
This is an H2206...

1207
01:42:35,076 --> 01:42:39,570
authorizing the compulsory,
temporary requisitioning of this flat...

1208
01:42:39,681 --> 01:42:41,581
for our necessary repairs.

1209
01:42:41,683 --> 01:42:43,583
- Repairs!
- What?

1210
01:42:43,685 --> 01:42:46,085
- No! You -
- Oh! Don't forget your receipt.

1211
01:42:46,187 --> 01:42:49,213
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
- No, sir. Don't forget your receipt.

1212
01:42:49,324 --> 01:42:52,384
I 'm sorry, but I 'm a bit
of a stickler for paperwork.

1213
01:42:52,493 --> 01:42:55,394
He's a stickler for paperwork, sir!

1214
01:42:55,496 --> 01:42:58,090
- Bastards!

1215
01:43:00,535 --> 01:43:02,594
Shh.

1216
01:43:08,576 --> 01:43:10,942
Tuttle.

1217
01:43:11,045 --> 01:43:13,445
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

1218
01:43:30,231 --> 01:43:32,222
Phew-ee.

1219
01:44:03,698 --> 01:44:06,132
Oh, God.

1220
01:44:06,234 --> 01:44:08,702
- Jesus Christ!
- The smell! Stop!

1221
01:44:10,538 --> 01:44:12,438
Filling up with -

1222
01:44:12,540 --> 01:44:16,374
- Oh, God.

1223
01:44:17,812 --> 01:44:20,303
Oh, Jesus!

1224
01:44:23,384 --> 01:44:26,114
Oh!

1225
01:44:28,823 --> 01:44:30,791
Shit!

1226
01:44:32,460 --> 01:44:34,360
We're all in it together, kid.

1227
01:44:46,674 --> 01:44:49,234
Jill. Jill!

1228
01:44:50,278 --> 01:44:53,645
Jill. Oh, God.

1229
01:44:53,748 --> 01:44:57,240
Are you all right?
What happened to you after -

1230
01:44:57,352 --> 01:45:00,185
Your face. Are you hurt?

1231
01:45:01,222 --> 01:45:03,122
Um, no, I-I'm fine.

1232
01:45:03,224 --> 01:45:06,660
It's - Well -

1233
01:45:06,761 --> 01:45:09,286
I've been worried sick about you.

1234
01:45:23,177 --> 01:45:26,078
- Who was that?
- That's a friend of mine. He -

1235
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:29,377
- Oh, God. Holy shit.

1236
01:45:29,484 --> 01:45:33,511
We'd better get out of here quick.
Come on. Quietly.

1237
01:45:37,525 --> 01:45:39,493
Look out. Here. Take this.

1238
01:45:41,863 --> 01:45:43,831
Looks big.

1239
01:45:54,442 --> 01:45:56,410
Here.

1240
01:45:58,146 --> 01:46:00,444
Quick. Quick.

1241
01:46:33,701 --> 01:46:37,159
- Are you sure this is all right?
- Yes. Yes, certain.

1242
01:46:38,606 --> 01:46:40,733
My mother's away for Christmas.

1243
01:46:42,110 --> 01:46:44,578
She's spending it at the plastic surgeon's.

1244
01:46:48,015 --> 01:46:50,142
The wraps come off tomorrow.

1245
01:47:30,591 --> 01:47:34,994
Lock the door after me.
Don't answer the phone to anyone.

1246
01:47:35,096 --> 01:47:37,360
I won't be long.

1247
01:47:38,599 --> 01:47:41,500
- Where are you going?
- I know a way to save you.

1248
01:47:41,602 --> 01:47:44,765
- Trust me. I can do it.
- But you can't go without me.

1249
01:48:20,475 --> 01:48:23,535
Excuse me, Dawson. Could you put me through
to Mr. Helpmann's office, please?

1250
01:48:23,644 --> 01:48:25,544
I'm afraid I can't, sir.

1251
01:48:25,646 --> 01:48:28,547
- You have to go through the proper channels.

1252
01:48:28,649 --> 01:48:34,053
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are
because that's classified information.

1253
01:48:34,155 --> 01:48:39,559
I'm glad to see the ministry is continuing
its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.

1254
01:48:39,660 --> 01:48:41,628
Thank you, Dawson.

1255
01:48:49,813 --> 01:48:53,408
~ The first Noel~

1256
01:48:53,517 --> 01:48:56,782
~ The angels did say ~

1257
01:48:56,887 --> 01:49:00,186
~ Was to certain poor shepherds ~

1258
01:49:00,290 --> 01:49:03,623
~ In fields as they lay ~

1259
01:49:03,727 --> 01:49:06,958
~ In fields where they ~

1260
01:49:07,063 --> 01:49:08,963
No, no, no, Arthur!

1261
01:49:09,065 --> 01:49:10,965
You' re flat on the "G."

1262
01:49:11,067 --> 01:49:12,134
It's your breathing.

1263
01:49:12,084 --> 01:49:14,245
Ready? One, two, three.

1264
01:49:14,352 --> 01:49:16,912
~ The first Noel ~

1265
01:49:17,923 --> 01:49:20,756
~ The angels did say ~

1266
01:49:20,964 --> 01:49:25,298
'Ere I am, J.H.

1267
01:49:25,402 --> 01:49:27,962
- The ghost in the machine.

1268
01:49:28,071 --> 01:49:31,768
E-R-E-I-A-M-J-H.

1269
01:49:54,564 --> 01:49:56,532
Mr. Helpmann.

1270
01:50:05,742 --> 01:50:07,710
Mr. Helpmann.

1271
01:50:34,004 --> 01:50:35,972
Mr. Helpmann?

1272
01:51:41,849 --> 01:51:43,817
Jill.

1273
01:51:46,187 --> 01:51:48,155
Jill?

1274
01:52:02,603 --> 01:52:04,571
Jill?

1275
01:52:35,265 --> 01:52:37,233
Who's there?

1276
01:52:44,643 --> 01:52:47,203
What do you think?

1277
01:52:47,312 --> 01:52:49,542
Is it me?

1278
01:52:55,087 --> 01:52:57,055
Well?

1279
01:53:01,994 --> 01:53:04,895
You don't exist anymore.

1280
01:53:04,997 --> 01:53:06,965
I've killed you.

1281
01:53:11,370 --> 01:53:13,338
Jill Layton is dead.

1282
01:53:19,568 --> 01:53:22,264
Care for a little necrophilia?

1283
01:53:22,370 --> 01:53:24,338
Hmm?

1284
01:53:26,174 --> 01:53:28,301
Yee-hah! Yee-hah!

1285
01:54:14,993 --> 01:54:18,053
Sh-She's dead.
This is just a friend of mine.

1286
01:54:18,163 --> 01:54:21,064
- She's -

1287
01:54:21,166 --> 01:54:23,066
- What are you -
- No!

1288
01:54:23,168 --> 01:54:25,159
- Oh, my God!
- No! Sam!

1289
01:54:44,785 --> 01:54:46,878
Don't fight it, son.

1290
01:54:46,987 --> 01:54:49,046
Confess quickly.

1291
01:54:50,190 --> 01:54:53,353
I fyou hold out too long,
you could jeopardize your credit rating.

1292
01:55:04,758 --> 01:55:07,488
- Thank you.

1293
01:55:41,128 --> 01:55:43,392
Jack?

1294
01:55:47,164 --> 01:55:49,257
Jack.

1295
01:55:49,366 --> 01:55:51,459
Jack. Jack!

1296
01:55:51,568 --> 01:55:53,468
Shut up.

1297
01:55:53,570 --> 01:55:56,767
Jack. Jack, I'm innocent.
Please.

1298
01:55:56,874 --> 01:55:59,138
- Help me.
- Bastard.

1299
01:56:00,377 --> 01:56:02,072
Jack.

1300
01:56:02,179 --> 01:56:04,875
Jack, this is all a mistake.
Please,Jack.

1301
01:56:04,982 --> 01:56:06,950
Take that mask off.

1302
01:56:12,122 --> 01:56:14,090
You stupid bastard.

1303
01:56:15,359 --> 01:56:17,793
- Jack.
- How could you do this to me?

1304
01:56:17,895 --> 01:56:19,795
Jack, I'm frightened.

1305
01:56:19,897 --> 01:56:22,127
How do you think I feel, you shit?

1306
01:56:22,232 --> 01:56:24,200
- Jack -
- Shut up!

1307
01:56:28,705 --> 01:56:33,039
This is a professional relationship.

1308
01:56:34,144 --> 01:56:36,044
Jack.

1309
01:56:36,146 --> 01:56:39,343
Jack, no, you can't.

1310
01:56:39,450 --> 01:56:42,010
No, Jack, please.

1311
01:56:42,119 --> 01:56:44,212
Jack, no! Don't!

1312
01:56:44,321 --> 01:56:46,789
Please, Jack! No!

1313
01:57:31,869 --> 01:57:34,861
- You okay?
- Tuttle!

1314
01:57:34,972 --> 01:57:36,940
Call me Harry.

1315
01:58:24,555 --> 01:58:26,853
Let's go!

1316
01:58:57,421 --> 01:58:58,854
Here. Here.

1317
02:03:29,850 --> 02:03:33,684
Ah, Mr. Lowry.
So pleased you could make it.

1318
02:03:33,787 --> 02:03:36,051
Right this way.

1319
02:03:40,561 --> 02:03:42,529
It's a sad loss.

1320
02:03:42,630 --> 02:03:45,326
Your mother was with her at the end.

1321
02:03:45,432 --> 02:03:49,664
The gift of eternal life.

1322
02:03:49,770 --> 02:03:54,901
Mrs. Terrain has just received
that most wonderful of gifts.

1323
02:03:55,009 --> 02:03:57,307
She came to us physically new.

1324
02:03:57,411 --> 02:04:01,472
She goes hence from us
not so physically new.

1325
02:04:01,582 --> 02:04:03,482
But the spirit never grows old.

1326
02:04:08,928 --> 02:04:10,896
Mother.

1327
02:04:12,197 --> 02:04:14,097
Oh. Sam.

1328
02:04:14,199 --> 02:04:16,667
Mother. Mother!

1329
02:04:17,337 --> 02:04:19,567
Stop calling me that.

1330
02:04:20,607 --> 02:04:24,008
Mother! Mother, please!

1331
02:04:24,111 --> 02:04:27,478
- Is this guy bothering you?
- Oh. Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

1332
02:04:27,581 --> 02:04:30,414
Mother!

1333
02:04:30,517 --> 02:04:34,578
Go away.
This is a very sacred moment.

1334
02:07:41,153 --> 02:07:43,314
He's got away from us, Jack.

1335
02:07:43,422 --> 02:07:45,720
Afraid you're right, Mr. Helpmann.

1336
02:07:45,824 --> 02:07:48,384
He's gone.

1337
02:07:48,493 --> 02:07:50,927
Mmm.

1338
02:07:51,029 --> 02:07:52,997
Well -

1339
02:08:20,104 --> 02:08:22,971
~ Then ~

1340
02:08:23,074 --> 02:08:28,444
~ Tomorrow was another day ~

1341
02:08:28,546 --> 02:08:32,846
~ The morning found me miles away ~

1342
02:08:33,884 --> 02:08:39,186
~ With still a million things to say ~

1343
02:08:41,625 --> 02:08:44,492
~ Now ~

1344
02:08:44,595 --> 02:08:48,691
~ As twilight gleams the sky above ~

1345
02:08:49,900 --> 02:08:54,166
~ Recalling thrills of our love ~

1346
02:08:55,506 --> 02:08:59,875
~ There's one thing I'm certain of ~

1347
02:08:59,977 --> 02:09:02,878
~ Return ~

1348
02:09:02,980 --> 02:09:05,778
~ I will ~

1349
02:09:05,883 --> 02:09:09,341
~ To old ~

1350
02:09:09,453 --> 02:09:13,981
~ Brazil ~
