1
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,405
I'm so tired I could stay here all day.

2
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:45,522
Every bone in my body needs rest.

3
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:48,607
Good. Start with your jawbone.

4
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,005
Okay, it's zipped.

5
00:00:51,653 --> 00:00:54,451
Thank you. Sweet dreams.

6
00:00:56,933 --> 00:00:59,163
Come on, get up! You're late!

7
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,364
Roma!

8
00:01:48,373 --> 00:01:50,807
I can't believe
we're gonna be here all summer.

9
00:01:50,893 --> 00:01:53,407
- How cool is that?
- It's beyond cool!

10
00:01:54,453 --> 00:01:56,409
So much to do, so much to see.

11
00:01:56,493 --> 00:01:59,803
The culture, the history,
the incredible food.

12
00:01:59,893 --> 00:02:01,531
The Italian boys.

13
00:02:01,893 --> 00:02:04,532
And it's all very good.

14
00:02:05,053 --> 00:02:08,011
I can't believe this place is 2,700 years old.

15
00:02:08,093 --> 00:02:10,653
There is some big-time history here.

16
00:02:11,693 --> 00:02:15,208
I mean, the Roman empire,
gladiators, Michelangelo...

17
00:02:15,293 --> 00:02:16,089
Versace.

18
00:02:16,173 --> 00:02:19,961
And don't forget Caesar,
and I'm not just talking about salad.

19
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:22,487
And it's all ours for six weeks.

20
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,845
Do you think
they'll let us work on a fashion shoot?

21
00:03:07,173 --> 00:03:09,926
Doubtful.
I mean, we are only summer interns.

22
00:03:10,013 --> 00:03:11,890
Well, mailroom interns.

23
00:03:11,973 --> 00:03:15,249
But wouldn't it be cool to do
something meaningful for the company?

24
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:18,723
- Something special?
- Like be on time our first day?

25
00:03:20,573 --> 00:03:22,723
Guys, we're late!

26
00:03:22,813 --> 00:03:25,805
Paolo. Come on! Get up, man.

27
00:03:27,093 --> 00:03:29,766
Heidi, you think Derek Hammond
is going to be there?

28
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:33,084
Dari, relax. It's just a summer job!

29
00:03:33,173 --> 00:03:36,449
Buongiorno is good morning
and ciao is hello.

30
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:37,648
Or goodbye.

31
00:03:38,053 --> 00:03:40,408
A word that means both hello
and goodbye.

32
00:03:40,493 --> 00:03:43,690
- Man, we're way behind schedule, okay?
- I don't live by schedule.

33
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:46,810
This summer you do. This internship
could be a great opportunity.

34
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,088
I'm gonna make the most of this.
Come on!

35
00:03:49,173 --> 00:03:51,084
Derek Hammond runs an airline...

36
00:03:51,173 --> 00:03:55,086
a hot record company, a top fashion line,
and a dozen magazines.

37
00:03:55,173 --> 00:03:58,085
He's one of the most powerful men
in the world!

38
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:03,403
- Ma che sei matto!
- No, I'm not nuts. We're late. Let's go.

39
00:04:03,573 --> 00:04:07,088
And you know what they say about Italian.
It's the language of romance.

40
00:04:07,173 --> 00:04:10,006
Well, I haven't met anyone
worthy of romance.

41
00:04:10,093 --> 00:04:13,642
We just flew 13 hours from Los Angeles
over the Arctic circle...

42
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:15,928
and came straight here
from the Roma Airport.

43
00:04:16,013 --> 00:04:19,164
The only person that we've met
so far was the cab driver.

44
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,246
Nice shoes.

45
00:04:23,893 --> 00:04:26,532
All I'm saying is
it would've been much easier...

46
00:04:26,613 --> 00:04:28,285
to work at the mall this summer.

47
00:04:28,373 --> 00:04:32,127
Charli, this is a great opportunity
for us to learn about the fashion business.

48
00:04:32,213 --> 00:04:34,488
I mean, in the center of the fashion world!

49
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:38,088
I'm sure we'll make a mistake or two,
but we'll be fine.

50
00:04:38,173 --> 00:04:40,733
And maybe we'll even run into
Giorgio Armani.

51
00:04:42,453 --> 00:04:44,523
Come on, interns! Hustle it up!

52
00:04:52,253 --> 00:04:54,528
Scusa. Mi dispiace.

53
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:57,330
Hello, Rome.

54
00:04:58,213 --> 00:05:01,091
- I am Paolo.
- I'm impressed.

55
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:04,246
I'm Charli.

56
00:05:05,493 --> 00:05:08,246
Paolo, you can let her go now.

57
00:05:08,693 --> 00:05:09,921
But why?

58
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,450
Not all of you have met,
so why don't we introduce ourselves?

59
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:19,206
I'm Jami. I'm a Senior VP
here at Hammond Enterprises...

60
00:05:19,293 --> 00:05:21,932
and I am your Summer Internship Director.

61
00:05:22,013 --> 00:05:24,481
I am from New Jersey, U.S.A.

62
00:05:25,213 --> 00:05:27,727
- You?
- Daria. Venice, Italy.

63
00:05:28,613 --> 00:05:30,524
I'm Nobu. Tokyo, Japan.

64
00:05:31,053 --> 00:05:33,328
Leila. Los Angeles, California.

65
00:05:33,773 --> 00:05:35,411
Charli. The same.

66
00:05:36,413 --> 00:05:38,881
I'm Paolo, from right here in Roma.

67
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:41,250
Heidi. Munich, Germany.

68
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:45,326
Great. Now that we're all well-acquainted,
let's hurry because we're late.

69
00:06:11,173 --> 00:06:13,971
Wait. Let me catch my breath for a sec.

70
00:06:14,653 --> 00:06:18,407
These are the Spanish Steps.
Completed in 1726.

71
00:06:19,173 --> 00:06:20,925
The original Stairmaster!

72
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:24,323
We're in Italy.
We're on Spanish steps. Weird.

73
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:28,013
Is that what you Americans call jokes?

74
00:06:28,093 --> 00:06:29,845
No, jokes are funny.

75
00:06:30,093 --> 00:06:32,732
- We're meeting Derek Hammond, right?
- One never knows.

76
00:06:32,813 --> 00:06:35,043
Come on, we're late. Let's go.

77
00:06:42,973 --> 00:06:44,167
Hi. Sorry.

78
00:06:44,253 --> 00:06:46,562
Benvenuti, welcome. Buongiorno.

79
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:50,682
Grazie. I am so thirsty.
Can I have some orange juice, please?

80
00:06:50,773 --> 00:06:54,812
- Can I get an iced tea or something?
- Or bagels? We're hungry.

81
00:06:54,893 --> 00:06:56,212
Interns...

82
00:06:56,293 --> 00:06:59,524
may I introduce you
to signor Enrico Tortoni.

83
00:06:59,613 --> 00:07:01,808
He heads up the Roma offices.

84
00:07:03,373 --> 00:07:07,048
I am so sorry about
the whole orange juice thing.

85
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:10,409
No offense taken,
Miss Leila Hunter of Los Angeles.

86
00:07:10,693 --> 00:07:14,402
- You know her name?
- I know all your names, signorina Charli.

87
00:07:14,493 --> 00:07:18,042
You will be working for me,
so it's good that I know, no?

88
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:20,647
Please, my regular table is waiting.

89
00:07:31,973 --> 00:07:34,851
But I thought we were working
for Derek Hammond.

90
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:37,083
Sorry to disappoint, Dari, but you know...

91
00:07:37,173 --> 00:07:40,210
Mr. Hammond is in New York one day,
Paris the next.

92
00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:42,210
Me, I am always here.

93
00:07:42,453 --> 00:07:45,013
And you are 47 minutes late.

94
00:07:45,093 --> 00:07:48,244
It's their first day,
and with the jet lag and everything it's...

95
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,528
Yes. Please. I'm just joking.

96
00:07:52,453 --> 00:07:53,966
Welcome to Roma.

97
00:07:54,053 --> 00:07:57,090
So you will spend the summer
working in our mailroom?

98
00:07:57,173 --> 00:08:00,882
Making deliveries and performing
other important tasks.

99
00:08:01,093 --> 00:08:04,927
And all the while learning
about an international corporation?

100
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:09,003
For our business, or any business
to be successful...

101
00:08:09,093 --> 00:08:13,052
everyone, from bottom to top,
must do their job and do it right.

102
00:08:13,373 --> 00:08:16,046
You people are very important to me.

103
00:08:16,453 --> 00:08:19,445
- We picked you from amongst...
- Ecco il suo caffÃ©.

104
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:23,328
We picked you from amongst
hundreds of other applicants.

105
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:27,525
Delizioso.

106
00:08:28,293 --> 00:08:31,763
So sorry to be so brief,
but I have a meeting at the office.

107
00:08:31,853 --> 00:08:33,809
- Enjoy the food.
- Thank you.

108
00:08:33,893 --> 00:08:37,488
- I wish you the best. Arrivederci.
- Arrivederci.

109
00:08:38,373 --> 00:08:40,933
- I like Mr. Tortellini.
- Tortoni.

110
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:44,251
I expect you at the office in 15 minutes.

111
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:47,206
Welcome to Roma,
Hammond International...

112
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,966
and the world's fastest breakfast ever.

113
00:08:51,053 --> 00:08:54,728
Okay, but in all seriousness, guys,
Mr. Hammond will be picking two of you...

114
00:08:54,813 --> 00:08:58,249
to be his personal assistants
in New York next summer.

115
00:08:58,693 --> 00:09:01,366
So we're all competing with each other?

116
00:09:20,413 --> 00:09:24,406
I speak good English, so we have
many problem with communication.

117
00:09:24,613 --> 00:09:26,968
If you speak good English...

118
00:09:27,053 --> 00:09:30,602
don't you mean that we won't
have any communication problems?

119
00:09:30,693 --> 00:09:34,208
Correct! I speak good English,
you speak good English...

120
00:09:34,293 --> 00:09:36,284
we no communicate at all.

121
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:39,932
Gianni funny?

122
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:43,365
Laugh! Have much fun! Enjoy! Ridete!

123
00:09:45,973 --> 00:09:48,123
This guy is a piece of cake.

124
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,124
No more, that's enough!

125
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:55,409
Pay attention. This is Gianni Rigoletti's
mailroom. Capire? Understand?

126
00:09:56,213 --> 00:09:58,568
No jokes, no playing around...

127
00:09:59,053 --> 00:10:00,964
no romance. Just work.

128
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:04,283
Now let's sort mail.

129
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:05,768
Presto!

130
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,685
Paolo and Charli,
I have your first assignment.

131
00:10:30,773 --> 00:10:33,048
You are to take
these two boxes of fabric...

132
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,648
to San Pastriani at the fabric shop
at Piazza Del Giorno.

133
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:39,611
You must get these there
within the hour, capito?

134
00:10:39,693 --> 00:10:41,524
We're counting on you.

135
00:10:41,893 --> 00:10:44,043
We are so lost.

136
00:10:44,253 --> 00:10:47,404
I mean, why don't you know
where we are? You live here.

137
00:10:47,493 --> 00:10:51,281
You can live in Roma 100 years
and not know these crazy streets.

138
00:10:51,373 --> 00:10:53,364
Well, I'll check the map.

139
00:10:53,893 --> 00:10:56,248
The map? You don't need this.

140
00:10:59,613 --> 00:11:00,966
You're so Americana.

141
00:11:01,053 --> 00:11:04,011
Paolo, I am so close
to getting in your face.

142
00:11:04,293 --> 00:11:07,410
I have no problem with our faces
getting closer.

143
00:11:09,213 --> 00:11:10,328
Okay.

144
00:11:12,133 --> 00:11:14,647
Some packages are not meant
to be delivered.

145
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:17,930
I'm not giving up.
When I have a job to do, I get it done.

146
00:11:18,013 --> 00:11:19,128
Okay.

147
00:11:29,493 --> 00:11:33,088
We're delivering mail, and Paolo and Charli
are out riding Vespas.

148
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:36,649
- Paolo is very cute.
- Not for me.

149
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:39,649
You have a boyfriend back home?

150
00:11:39,853 --> 00:11:44,085
No, Paolo's not for me because I think
my sister might be interested.

151
00:11:44,573 --> 00:11:47,167
You don't compete with your sister?

152
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,568
No. I don't and I won't.

153
00:11:50,093 --> 00:11:52,527
Well, I'm not your sister.

154
00:11:53,893 --> 00:11:56,168
Grazie. Okay, ciao.

155
00:11:57,173 --> 00:11:58,606
Leila! Heidi!

156
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:03,405
Hey, there you go.

157
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:05,971
You're a fashion designer?

158
00:12:06,453 --> 00:12:09,172
Sort of. I do manage the design team.

159
00:12:09,373 --> 00:12:12,251
So a successful internship
can lead to good things.

160
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:16,842
It's not the yellow brick road to Oz,
but you do get your foot in the door.

161
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:20,642
- What are you working on?
- Right now we are designing...

162
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:23,691
our spring line
for an Elle fashion magazine shoot...

163
00:12:23,773 --> 00:12:25,809
and Bruno Fillitti is shooting.

164
00:12:26,053 --> 00:12:28,283
Fillitti is an amazing photographer.

165
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:31,683
His black-and-white Armani campaign
was mesmerizing.

166
00:12:32,133 --> 00:12:36,046
- You know your photography.
- It could make or break our season.

167
00:12:36,253 --> 00:12:39,484
I have an important assignment for you.
Please go to the hat shop...

168
00:12:39,573 --> 00:12:43,725
and pick up the newly designed cap
for Mr. Hammond's personal pilot.

169
00:12:43,813 --> 00:12:45,087
Right away, Mr. Tortoni.

170
00:12:47,373 --> 00:12:49,170
This is no challenge.

171
00:12:50,053 --> 00:12:52,806
This is so easy. A monkey could do this.

172
00:12:53,453 --> 00:12:57,048
- Then why didn't they hire monkeys?
- Exactly.

173
00:13:00,973 --> 00:13:03,168
Piazza Del Popolo, presto.

174
00:13:03,253 --> 00:13:05,926
Our first hour of work and I failed.

175
00:13:06,813 --> 00:13:08,451
Grazie. A presto.

176
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:12,886
Okay, look where you are. Is this bad?

177
00:13:13,253 --> 00:13:17,041
Okay, dig the tour,
but we have deliveries to make!

178
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,846
I love my city.

179
00:13:20,693 --> 00:13:23,127
You're so passionate about Rome.

180
00:13:23,893 --> 00:13:27,602
But yet you're not at all interested
in the intern program.

181
00:13:27,693 --> 00:13:31,527
The intern program, yeah.
But my partner? I'm very interested.

182
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:35,243
Okay, if we're partners,
let's work together.

183
00:13:41,293 --> 00:13:43,807
- Ciao, Vittorio.
- Buongiorno, Paolo.

184
00:13:43,973 --> 00:13:46,123
Grazie di essere venuto.
Stanno qua dietro.

185
00:13:46,213 --> 00:13:48,807
Vittorio's delivered pizza
to every address in Roma.

186
00:13:48,893 --> 00:13:52,044
- He's taking our packages.
- He is delivering the packages for us.

187
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:55,250
It's no problem.
Now we can spend time together.

188
00:13:55,933 --> 00:13:58,493
Italian boys. I was warned.

189
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:03,525
Here we are.

190
00:14:03,613 --> 00:14:06,002
The last of 240 collated
and bound copies...

191
00:14:06,093 --> 00:14:09,210
of the third-quarter-record
fiscal company budget.

192
00:14:09,293 --> 00:14:13,605
Record budget? We are supposed
to be copying the airline press release.

193
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,168
What?

194
00:14:16,013 --> 00:14:17,207
Oh, no!

195
00:14:18,613 --> 00:14:20,683
Where's that monkey when you need him?

196
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:41,046
Buongiorno.

197
00:14:41,533 --> 00:14:43,763
I'm looking for a pilot's hat.

198
00:14:44,413 --> 00:14:45,766
You know...

199
00:14:45,853 --> 00:14:48,890
airplane? You know, wings, cockpit.

200
00:14:51,493 --> 00:14:54,087
Ho capito. SÃ­, ho capito.

201
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:55,927
Grazie!

202
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:03,050
I'm very disappointed.

203
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:07,130
You two make 240 copies
of the wrong document.

204
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:11,723
You were supposed to deliver fabric...

205
00:15:12,093 --> 00:15:15,290
but instead
our deliveries get pepperoni pizzas.

206
00:15:17,013 --> 00:15:20,722
And, Leila, I'm, well, surprised.

207
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:24,242
Was there a problem with the hat?

208
00:15:24,493 --> 00:15:26,927
Does this look like a pilot's cap?

209
00:15:28,773 --> 00:15:31,810
I am so sorry, Mr. Tortoni,
there should be no excuse.

210
00:15:31,893 --> 00:15:34,361
I dislike doing this, but everyone...

211
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,967
other than Heidi, is on probation.

212
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:42,172
- Mr. Tortoni, it's their first day.
- Okay, preliminary probation.

213
00:15:43,573 --> 00:15:46,883
Preliminary probation? What's that?

214
00:15:46,973 --> 00:15:48,850
I am running a company here.

215
00:15:48,933 --> 00:15:51,447
I cannot tolerate these incidents.

216
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:53,965
The next time...

217
00:15:57,253 --> 00:15:59,767
Well, let's not have a next time.

218
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:08,288
What was that all about?

219
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:29,127
I can't believe we almost got fired
from a summer job...

220
00:16:29,213 --> 00:16:30,566
and it's not even summer.

221
00:16:30,653 --> 00:16:32,723
Our parents would be so upset!

222
00:16:32,813 --> 00:16:37,045
Hey, guys, concentrate on doing things
right and you'll do them right.

223
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:41,283
Easy for you to say.
You lucked out with interoffice mail.

224
00:16:41,493 --> 00:16:44,929
You couldn't get a copy order right?
A monkey could do that.

225
00:16:45,093 --> 00:16:48,130
Can you guys please stop fighting?
We're a team, remember?

226
00:16:48,213 --> 00:16:52,206
- You took this too serious.
- Paolo, we have a situation here.

227
00:16:52,733 --> 00:16:55,691
It's your first day in Roma.
Can we please...

228
00:16:55,853 --> 00:16:58,925
how you say, chill and have some fun?

229
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:29,766
Are we ever going to meet
Derek Hammond?

230
00:17:31,373 --> 00:17:33,409
Yeah, I know. It's strange.

231
00:17:33,493 --> 00:17:37,008
Our first day as interns, and the CEO
of a multinational corporation...

232
00:17:37,093 --> 00:17:40,130
hasn't fallen all over himself
to come meet us.

233
00:17:40,453 --> 00:17:43,206
Yeah, I don't think that he even exists.

234
00:17:48,013 --> 00:17:50,527
Don't you want a photo
of your Internship Director?

235
00:17:50,613 --> 00:17:51,966
- Sure!
- Okay.

236
00:17:56,173 --> 00:17:58,448
Okay, just a little bit to your right.

237
00:17:58,533 --> 00:18:00,922
You're really serious about this.

238
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:04,244
Well, to capture an image, freeze time...

239
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:06,728
make a moment last forever...

240
00:18:09,613 --> 00:18:11,092
it's all good.

241
00:18:14,573 --> 00:18:16,211
And this is Roma.

242
00:18:16,573 --> 00:18:18,086
Fun, alive...

243
00:18:18,493 --> 00:18:21,166
- and not a tight-up.
- Uptight.

244
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:23,605
Oh, yes.

245
00:18:24,773 --> 00:18:26,445
Can I make...

246
00:18:26,853 --> 00:18:31,051
I think it's called generalization.
All American girls are uptight.

247
00:18:32,213 --> 00:18:34,852
How do you know
so many American girls?

248
00:18:37,573 --> 00:18:39,768
- I am in trouble now.
- Yes.

249
00:18:42,373 --> 00:18:44,011
I meet many tourists.

250
00:18:44,093 --> 00:18:47,369
And you're digging yourself deeper.
Much deeper.

251
00:18:48,373 --> 00:18:50,887
- You really psyched about this summer?
- Absolutely.

252
00:18:50,973 --> 00:18:52,964
I mean, this is a dream come true.

253
00:18:53,053 --> 00:18:54,805
I meet them at work.

254
00:18:55,493 --> 00:18:57,404
So maybe you drive a tour bus.

255
00:18:57,493 --> 00:19:01,930
But that won't work 'cause you won't find
anything with your zero sense of direction.

256
00:19:02,013 --> 00:19:04,447
It seems like you have some goals.

257
00:19:05,573 --> 00:19:06,722
Well...

258
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,604
set goals, I'm not so sure.

259
00:19:09,693 --> 00:19:11,649
But I know what I like:

260
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:13,924
Fashion, photography.

261
00:19:14,013 --> 00:19:17,642
This summer I'm getting
the opportunity to get a little taste of that.

262
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:19,769
And if you like the taste?

263
00:19:20,213 --> 00:19:23,046
After college
maybe I'll be working for you.

264
00:19:24,173 --> 00:19:26,846
Maybe you work at customs
at the airport!

265
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:29,401
And you meet tons
of American women there!

266
00:19:29,493 --> 00:19:34,089
But that wouldn't be it because that job
you need to be very punctual, so...

267
00:19:36,293 --> 00:19:39,410
Sorry, Charli, if I'm rude, but relax.

268
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:40,882
Chill.

269
00:19:41,053 --> 00:19:43,647
Be mellow. Be cool. Be Italian.

270
00:19:43,853 --> 00:19:47,323
Tomorrow is a new day,
so we're not gonna worry about...

271
00:19:47,693 --> 00:19:50,651
- Do we get to spend it together?
- Certamente.

272
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:54,567
- I guess I'll take that as a yes.
- SÃ­.

273
00:20:14,373 --> 00:20:17,046
- Buongiorno, signor Tortoni.
- Leila!

274
00:20:18,053 --> 00:20:19,771
It's going good, no?

275
00:20:19,853 --> 00:20:22,970
I'm starting to get a grasp
on your corporation.

276
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:25,969
- Tell me.
- Well...

277
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:30,610
Your magazine promotes your fashions
and your recording artists.

278
00:20:30,693 --> 00:20:33,161
Your recording artists
wear your fashions...

279
00:20:33,253 --> 00:20:36,962
and you push your magazines
and music on your airplanes.

280
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,449
One might think your divisions don't fit.

281
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:42,206
But they complement each other, right?

282
00:20:42,453 --> 00:20:45,092
Yes. It's called vertical integration.

283
00:20:45,493 --> 00:20:47,723
Leila, you are a very smart young lady.

284
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:51,010
And I know you will be very valuable
to us this summer.

285
00:20:51,093 --> 00:20:52,685
You like music?

286
00:20:53,093 --> 00:20:57,325
This is a hot new artist we just recorded
at our London studios.

287
00:20:57,893 --> 00:20:59,690
Take Heidi...

288
00:20:59,933 --> 00:21:02,572
and deliver this to signor Piranesi.

289
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:06,612
He's my inside source
at Roma's top radio station.

290
00:21:07,093 --> 00:21:09,766
Sure, Mr. Tortoni,
I'll take care of it right away.

291
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:12,811
And any time you wanna talk,
my door is open.

292
00:21:13,893 --> 00:21:16,282
- Thank you. Ciao.
- Ciao.

293
00:21:24,973 --> 00:21:27,043
- Heidi, stop.
- What?

294
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:30,122
According to the Tommaso Guida...

295
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,722
we're going in the wrong direction.

296
00:21:32,813 --> 00:21:35,611
But if we go down there and make a left...

297
00:21:37,533 --> 00:21:41,048
Aren't you at least curious
to hear this hot new artist?

298
00:21:42,053 --> 00:21:45,523
We're already on probation.
Let's just deliver this.

299
00:21:47,053 --> 00:21:49,408
So we have to get the coffee ready
for the break.

300
00:21:49,493 --> 00:21:51,290
As long as it's easy.

301
00:21:53,293 --> 00:21:55,523
So this is either modern art...

302
00:21:55,613 --> 00:21:58,764
- or the coffee machine.
- That's espresso machine.

303
00:22:00,013 --> 00:22:01,651
- Espresso?
- Yeah.

304
00:22:02,173 --> 00:22:04,323
Coffee with a colossal kick.

305
00:22:04,413 --> 00:22:08,326
There's nothing more important
to a Roman than their caffÃ© ristretto...

306
00:22:08,413 --> 00:22:11,211
or what you Americans call espresso.

307
00:22:12,413 --> 00:22:14,722
You know how to work this thing?

308
00:22:16,893 --> 00:22:18,929
Here are the instructions.

309
00:22:20,613 --> 00:22:22,683
Very few step. Very simple.

310
00:22:22,773 --> 00:22:25,048
I'll be back in 20 minutes
with the pastries.

311
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:28,330
- So I just follow the directions.
- Of course.

312
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:30,088
Okay?

313
00:22:31,253 --> 00:22:32,572
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

314
00:22:34,293 --> 00:22:37,649
Okay, a few steps. Very simple.

315
00:22:38,773 --> 00:22:40,843
Just follow the directions.

316
00:22:48,253 --> 00:22:51,484
- Smooth sailing, Dari.
- We did good, Nobu.

317
00:22:51,573 --> 00:22:54,246
We are definitely as smart as a monkey.

318
00:22:54,653 --> 00:22:56,928
Goodbye, preliminary probation.

319
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:01,291
Okay, so we put the thing in here...

320
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,241
pull it.

321
00:23:09,613 --> 00:23:12,081
I feel like I'm in chemistry class.

322
00:23:12,573 --> 00:23:15,087
Okay, then we put this in...

323
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:17,482
where?

324
00:23:18,453 --> 00:23:20,171
We'll put it there.

325
00:23:21,013 --> 00:23:22,241
Pull it.

326
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:28,049
There it is across the street.

327
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:30,089
- We have to listen to that CD.
- Hey.

328
00:23:30,173 --> 00:23:31,322
- Give it to me!
- No.

329
00:23:31,413 --> 00:23:33,802
- What are you afraid of?
- Our jobs, genius!

330
00:23:33,893 --> 00:23:36,123
- Give it to me!
- Give it to me!

331
00:23:40,773 --> 00:23:41,967
Oh, no.

332
00:23:45,053 --> 00:23:46,771
I can't believe it.

333
00:23:48,213 --> 00:23:49,931
- Ciao, Charli.
- Ciao.

334
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:53,926
You know what? At first, I didn't think
I was gonna be able to pull it off...

335
00:23:54,013 --> 00:23:56,652
but the coffee is looking pretty good.

336
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,286
Instant coffee.

337
00:24:12,693 --> 00:24:14,604
Instant coffee in Roma.

338
00:24:14,973 --> 00:24:17,009
Are you impazziti?

339
00:24:18,053 --> 00:24:19,202
Crazy.

340
00:24:19,813 --> 00:24:22,646
Sir, it's just coffee.

341
00:24:23,493 --> 00:24:26,246
Forse per gli Americani. In Roma...

342
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:28,364
coffee is a ritual.

343
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:32,688
As close to a religious experience
as anything.

344
00:24:34,053 --> 00:24:36,328
Sir, the espresso was my fault.

345
00:24:36,573 --> 00:24:38,803
What would she know about that?

346
00:24:38,893 --> 00:24:40,884
SÃ­, bravo.

347
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:44,892
That's very noble of you, Paolo,
but Charli could've asked for help.

348
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,604
But she took the easy way out.

349
00:24:47,693 --> 00:24:50,491
- Le dia un'altra possibilitÃ¡.
- Silenzio.

350
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:56,686
You can go.

351
00:24:57,333 --> 00:25:00,609
Send in Leila and Heidi.

352
00:25:08,053 --> 00:25:11,363
I'm a big girl.
It was my mess up, and I'll deal with it.

353
00:25:11,453 --> 00:25:13,683
Okay, I just tried to be nice.

354
00:25:13,853 --> 00:25:15,650
Just forget about it.

355
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:20,969
Leila and Heidi.

356
00:25:30,693 --> 00:25:34,129
I am beyond upset about the CD.

357
00:25:35,173 --> 00:25:39,086
Leila, I gave you a responsibility
and you were irresponsible.

358
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:41,933
- I'm so sorry, sir.
- Sorry, sorry.

359
00:25:42,573 --> 00:25:46,043
I'm hearing that way too much
from my American interns.

360
00:25:46,933 --> 00:25:48,924
You have anything to add?

361
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:51,841
It was an accident, signor Tortoni.

362
00:25:52,893 --> 00:25:54,849
But it was preventable...

363
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:58,323
as I warned Leila not to open the CD.

364
00:26:02,613 --> 00:26:05,047
I was wrong and it'll never happen again.

365
00:26:05,133 --> 00:26:08,205
No. It definitely will not.

366
00:26:10,573 --> 00:26:11,926
You can go.

367
00:26:17,093 --> 00:26:20,210
What was up with that?
You caused the CD mess!

368
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:22,688
That's not what Tortoni thinks.

369
00:26:22,933 --> 00:26:24,446
One last thing.

370
00:26:25,493 --> 00:26:28,530
We recruited you to help us,
not disappoint us.

371
00:26:29,053 --> 00:26:33,444
So in the interest of the company,
Leila and Charli, you're terminated.

372
00:26:38,453 --> 00:26:39,727
Let's go.

373
00:26:49,933 --> 00:26:52,606
I'm humiliated. Mortified.

374
00:26:53,453 --> 00:26:56,331
And worse, I'm disappointed in myself.

375
00:26:57,053 --> 00:26:59,726
Yeah, Mr. Tortoni
has been oversensitive lately.

376
00:26:59,813 --> 00:27:01,849
Personally, I think he overreacted.

377
00:27:01,933 --> 00:27:04,367
We were fired over instant coffee.

378
00:27:04,693 --> 00:27:06,923
I'd call that an overreaction.

379
00:27:08,173 --> 00:27:11,324
At least you get to see the Trevi Fountain.

380
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:21,210
They say if you throw a coin
in the fountain, you'll return to Rome.

381
00:27:21,293 --> 00:27:23,204
No coin tossing.

382
00:27:23,973 --> 00:27:28,251
I mean, after this nightmare,
I don't know when we'll be back to Rome.

383
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:32,406
Have you ever been so upset
that you want to cry, you need to cry...

384
00:27:32,493 --> 00:27:35,803
but you just can't cry
because it doesn't seem real?

385
00:27:37,413 --> 00:27:38,687
Hey, Lei.

386
00:27:39,173 --> 00:27:40,652
Life goes on.

387
00:27:42,013 --> 00:27:44,049
Thanks for cheering me up.

388
00:27:45,133 --> 00:27:47,647
Yeah, I'll save my tears
for the plane flight home.

389
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:49,883
We do have 13 hours to go.

390
00:27:50,093 --> 00:27:52,323
And we have three at the airport.

391
00:27:52,413 --> 00:27:55,052
I mean, that gives us 16 hours to cry.

392
00:27:56,373 --> 00:27:58,682
We never even met Derek Hammond.

393
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,805
Is that good or bad?

394
00:28:03,053 --> 00:28:06,682
- I tried to get you a message, but...
- You succeeded, Jami.

395
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:10,882
- I understand that Leila and Charli...
- You know our names?

396
00:28:11,213 --> 00:28:14,011
I know everything
about my summer interns.

397
00:28:14,213 --> 00:28:17,523
I'm not quite as out of the loop
as everyone thinks.

398
00:28:18,653 --> 00:28:21,531
We messed up, Mr. Hammond. I'm sorry.

399
00:28:22,053 --> 00:28:24,886
Enrico Tortoni has been with me
since the beginning.

400
00:28:24,973 --> 00:28:28,488
I trust him like a brother
and I respect his decisions.

401
00:28:28,693 --> 00:28:32,208
However, nothing is final unless I say so.

402
00:28:34,573 --> 00:28:36,848
Your suitcases are packed. Good.

403
00:28:37,613 --> 00:28:39,604
How is that a good thing?

404
00:28:39,893 --> 00:28:42,646
It's gonna take me a little bit of time
to work on Enrico.

405
00:28:42,733 --> 00:28:45,452
In the meantime
there's no point in going back to L.A.

406
00:28:45,533 --> 00:28:48,172
So I'd like to invite you and Miss Martin...

407
00:28:48,373 --> 00:28:51,570
to my seaside villa
for a few days of fun and sun.

408
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:56,084
My helicopter's waiting.
It's a 30-minute flight to the beach.

409
00:28:56,173 --> 00:29:00,530
- But, sir, I have a job.
- You're taking a few days off, end of story.

410
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:05,051
If Enrico's got a problem with it,
well, he can take it up with me.

411
00:29:07,653 --> 00:29:09,006
You know...

412
00:29:09,453 --> 00:29:12,570
eighteen years ago,
a penniless, backpacking student...

413
00:29:12,653 --> 00:29:15,326
stood right here at the Trevi Fountain.

414
00:29:16,053 --> 00:29:18,772
He made a wish and threw in a coin...

415
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:22,612
his last coin.

416
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,924
Did his wish come true?

417
00:29:29,053 --> 00:29:31,089
More than I ever imagined.

418
00:29:32,373 --> 00:29:35,092
And now, it's your turn.

419
00:29:40,293 --> 00:29:42,523
One, two, three!

420
00:30:07,253 --> 00:30:09,642
There are some spectacular shots.

421
00:30:09,853 --> 00:30:12,572
My camera's gonna be quite content
hanging with Hammond.

422
00:30:12,653 --> 00:30:16,123
You know, unemployment is not that bad.

423
00:30:16,413 --> 00:30:19,689
Okay, the setup is nice,
but I do want my job back.

424
00:30:19,973 --> 00:30:21,531
So do I...

425
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:24,969
you know,
after about three, four more weeks of this.

426
00:30:27,253 --> 00:30:29,562
Okay. Four days of this.

427
00:30:32,453 --> 00:30:33,806
Three days.

428
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:39,645
You know, I think the reason we're here
is Hammond has a thing for you.

429
00:30:40,053 --> 00:30:43,682
No. Mr. Hammond and I work together.
There is no thing.

430
00:30:44,453 --> 00:30:45,568
Okay.

431
00:30:47,493 --> 00:30:50,929
So, Charli, you think you'll ever talk
to Paolo again?

432
00:30:51,253 --> 00:30:53,721
That was a great change of subject.

433
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:58,646
You know, I don't think Paolo and I
would have ever really gotten along.

434
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:01,850
He thinks
I'm a way-too-uptight American...

435
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:04,401
and I think he's a way-too-laid-back Italian.

436
00:31:04,493 --> 00:31:06,290
Like oil and vinegar.

437
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,768
Yeah, they might not mix real well...

438
00:31:08,853 --> 00:31:12,687
but you put them on a salad
and it turns out to be a great combination.

439
00:31:22,253 --> 00:31:24,813
- Ha fatto un buon viaggio, signore?
- Eccellente.

440
00:31:24,893 --> 00:31:27,930
I've got some excellent branzino,
fresh off a local fishing boat.

441
00:31:28,013 --> 00:31:30,288
Have Carlo prepare this
for me and my guests.

442
00:31:30,373 --> 00:31:34,002
- Va bene, sarÃ¡ fatto, signore. Grazie.
- Grazie, Massimo.

443
00:31:38,173 --> 00:31:40,084
Do you mind if I look at your sketches?

444
00:31:40,173 --> 00:31:42,129
Yeah. It's just doodles.

445
00:31:49,813 --> 00:31:52,964
I've been in the fashion business
for 10 years...

446
00:31:53,533 --> 00:31:55,842
and this is way beyond doodling.

447
00:31:56,253 --> 00:31:59,006
You know, Lei and I are into fashion...

448
00:31:59,093 --> 00:32:01,561
and that's why we wanted
to become interns.

449
00:32:02,613 --> 00:32:06,128
- I want to show these to Mr. Hammond.
- No, Jami. Please.

450
00:32:09,293 --> 00:32:11,090
Okay. It's your call.

451
00:32:14,653 --> 00:32:17,690
- Derek, you're back.
- And I bring news with me.

452
00:32:18,893 --> 00:32:21,851
I just got off the phone
with Enrico Tortoni.

453
00:32:22,453 --> 00:32:23,852
What'd he say?

454
00:32:23,933 --> 00:32:26,606
If you're late Monday morning,
you're back on probation.

455
00:32:26,693 --> 00:32:28,809
- We're back in?
- We're back in?

456
00:32:28,973 --> 00:32:31,362
- Grazie!
- Thank you.

457
00:32:32,733 --> 00:32:36,089
I've got Carlo preparing lunch.
We'll eat on the veranda.

458
00:32:36,173 --> 00:32:38,482
Actually, I'm not that hungry.

459
00:32:38,573 --> 00:32:41,246
I think I'm just gonna hang around
and sketch.

460
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:44,530
Yeah, you know,
I'll go by the water and take some shots.

461
00:32:45,493 --> 00:32:46,642
- Yeah?
- Thank you.

462
00:32:46,733 --> 00:32:48,166
See you. 'Bye.

463
00:32:53,253 --> 00:32:55,687
- It's just you and me.
- Yeah.

464
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:00,043
You think they planned that?

465
00:33:07,413 --> 00:33:09,802
This intern program does no good.

466
00:33:10,133 --> 00:33:12,169
Hammond runs around the world...

467
00:33:12,253 --> 00:33:15,723
leaves me with six kids who know nothing
and get in my way.

468
00:33:15,813 --> 00:33:17,405
Hammond is foolish.

469
00:33:17,493 --> 00:33:20,053
Six? You fired Leila and Charli.

470
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:22,328
Hammond rehired the Americans.

471
00:33:22,413 --> 00:33:24,563
Good. I like them very much.

472
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:28,052
No, no. I like a little. Very little.

473
00:33:28,453 --> 00:33:32,241
I don't like interns.
I should do all the work.

474
00:33:32,493 --> 00:33:35,769
Everything.
Let Gianni do everything, right?

475
00:33:36,453 --> 00:33:37,681
Exactly.

476
00:33:58,973 --> 00:34:00,326
Are you crazy?

477
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,564
I didn't expect to see you.
There's not usually people around here.

478
00:34:03,653 --> 00:34:05,962
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. I'm fine.

479
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:10,130
- I'm Leila.
- I'm Ryan.

480
00:34:10,613 --> 00:34:13,207
- An American?
- Better. New Yorker.

481
00:34:13,573 --> 00:34:17,248
I'm from Los Angeles. I'm staying
with Mr. Hammond at his villa.

482
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:19,801
My sister and I are interning
at his company.

483
00:34:19,893 --> 00:34:21,121
Hammond.

484
00:34:21,453 --> 00:34:25,207
Oh, yeah. The big business guy
with the fancy house.

485
00:34:25,893 --> 00:34:28,088
Hey, you wanna go for a ride?

486
00:34:31,013 --> 00:34:33,163
Sure. But I don't like to go fast.

487
00:34:33,253 --> 00:34:35,528
Don't worry. I'll take it easy.

488
00:34:44,013 --> 00:34:45,332
Slow down!

489
00:34:45,773 --> 00:34:47,445
What do you think?

490
00:34:55,533 --> 00:34:57,683
You like it? Check this out.

491
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:10,003
I didn't go too fast, did I, Leila?

492
00:35:10,093 --> 00:35:13,722
- Thank God I didn't eat lunch.
- Yeah, you'd be wearing it.

493
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:16,851
My turn to drive.

494
00:35:45,533 --> 00:35:48,684
- I didn't go too fast, did I, Ryan?
- You're nuts.

495
00:35:50,613 --> 00:35:52,888
- But I deserved it.
- Ryan!

496
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,923
What did I tell you about driving like that?

497
00:35:56,013 --> 00:35:58,846
Sorry, Uncle Derek. It won't happen again.

498
00:36:01,133 --> 00:36:02,361
Explain.

499
00:36:02,813 --> 00:36:06,089
Hammond's my uncle,
and I'm staying with him for the summer.

500
00:36:06,893 --> 00:36:08,042
Alone?

501
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:10,488
No, I'm not alone. I got my friends.

502
00:36:10,573 --> 00:36:15,408
Miss Speedboat, Mr. Dune Buggy,
Uncle Harley-Davidson, surfboard.

503
00:36:16,853 --> 00:36:18,650
I'd be totally bored.

504
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:22,768
Leila, lighten up.
I thought you L.A. Types were laid back.

505
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:27,292
- Why aren't you in the intern program?
- What is this, 20 questions?

506
00:36:27,373 --> 00:36:29,170
It would just seem natural.

507
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:31,892
I mean, the intern program's in Rome,
you're very close.

508
00:36:31,973 --> 00:36:34,123
I mean, if the shoe fits...

509
00:36:34,373 --> 00:36:37,126
Sun and fun. Where's the bad, Leila?

510
00:36:37,373 --> 00:36:39,091
You're all by yourself.

511
00:36:39,173 --> 00:36:41,368
No, I'm not. Not today.

512
00:37:11,293 --> 00:37:14,126
Talk about the town that time forgot.

513
00:37:14,213 --> 00:37:17,205
No. This is the town that I bought.

514
00:37:18,093 --> 00:37:20,766
- You own this town?
- Every leaking roof.

515
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:24,570
Actually, some of the buildings
don't have roofs.

516
00:37:25,413 --> 00:37:27,404
Yeah, it's a bit of a fixer-upper.

517
00:37:27,493 --> 00:37:29,609
I know it sounds crazy...

518
00:37:29,933 --> 00:37:33,289
but I want to restore this town.
I want to make it an artists' colony...

519
00:37:33,373 --> 00:37:36,410
so that talented people
from all over the world can come here...

520
00:37:36,493 --> 00:37:39,690
and create without having to worry
about paying the rent.

521
00:37:39,773 --> 00:37:42,651
Remember, I was a starving artist once.

522
00:37:45,413 --> 00:37:47,529
I like everything about your idea.

523
00:37:48,613 --> 00:37:51,081
Words of support
from my first-ever intern.

524
00:37:51,693 --> 00:37:54,651
That's right. Eleven years ago.

525
00:37:55,453 --> 00:37:58,445
- I've been a good boss, though, haven't I?
- Yeah.

526
00:37:58,533 --> 00:38:01,172
I mean, I've been very professional...

527
00:38:02,173 --> 00:38:03,970
and kept my distance.

528
00:38:05,253 --> 00:38:06,686
You still do.

529
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:10,691
We work together.

530
00:38:11,253 --> 00:38:13,084
Yes. We work together.

531
00:38:14,773 --> 00:38:17,446
Look, now, I wish there was a solution.

532
00:38:18,493 --> 00:38:21,485
There's always supposed to be a solution,
isn't there?

533
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:27,403
- I have a solution.
- What?

534
00:38:28,213 --> 00:38:29,646
You're fired.

535
00:38:30,733 --> 00:38:31,848
What?

536
00:38:32,613 --> 00:38:34,683
You're joking, right?

537
00:38:36,453 --> 00:38:37,886
Wait up!

538
00:39:44,533 --> 00:39:48,287
Tortoni likes us.
We are not screw-up like Leila and Charli.

539
00:39:48,373 --> 00:39:52,161
A very reliable source told me
you screwed up the CD.

540
00:39:52,533 --> 00:39:54,967
You believe that? She was fired.

541
00:39:55,053 --> 00:39:58,887
I think more of us will be fired.
Something is up. I feel it.

542
00:39:59,253 --> 00:40:00,322
I'm not worried.

543
00:40:00,413 --> 00:40:03,883
As long as the two Americans are gone,
things will be good.

544
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,445
You guys, great news.

545
00:40:06,533 --> 00:40:09,286
Charli and Leila
have been rehired by Mr. Hammond.

546
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:10,931
All right.

547
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:24,965
It is so great here.

548
00:40:25,413 --> 00:40:27,802
Was it this nice when you were an intern?

549
00:40:28,293 --> 00:40:30,284
Mr. Hammond had just started his career.

550
00:40:30,373 --> 00:40:34,048
So a big outing for us
was a slice of pizza at the outdoor vendor.

551
00:40:34,653 --> 00:40:38,089
The freshest fish you ever tasted
will be ready in 30 minutes.

552
00:40:40,293 --> 00:40:43,649
You know, when you go back to work...

553
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:47,646
No, you two are very smart.
I don't need to tell you anything.

554
00:40:48,173 --> 00:40:51,609
We'd love to hear your words of wisdom.
I mean, you are Derek Hammond.

555
00:40:51,693 --> 00:40:53,923
Words, yes, wisdom...

556
00:40:55,573 --> 00:40:58,485
Be clever, be conscientious, be calm...

557
00:40:59,253 --> 00:41:02,962
be cooperative, be consistent, be creative.

558
00:41:03,693 --> 00:41:06,491
And most important of all, be confident.

559
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:08,652
Remember, Jami?

560
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:11,611
Hammond's seven "C's".
I remember them well.

561
00:41:13,453 --> 00:41:15,762
But enough talk about business.

562
00:41:16,573 --> 00:41:18,848
Let's check out the night sky.

563
00:41:19,293 --> 00:41:23,286
Why don't you go and enjoy the stars?
I want to talk with Leila.

564
00:41:27,413 --> 00:41:30,803
I invited Ryan here this summer...

565
00:41:30,893 --> 00:41:34,329
hoping proximity
would get him interested in the program.

566
00:41:34,413 --> 00:41:36,847
- What's your Plan B?
- You're good.

567
00:41:36,933 --> 00:41:39,447
Inviting you and your sister to the beach...

568
00:41:39,533 --> 00:41:43,128
hoping Ryan would bond
and would want to give work a try.

569
00:41:43,213 --> 00:41:45,568
That rocks. Look up there.

570
00:41:45,813 --> 00:41:47,405
What's Plan C?

571
00:41:48,133 --> 00:41:50,249
I was hoping you'd have one.

572
00:41:51,533 --> 00:41:54,206
Give me time. I'll figure something out.

573
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:56,051
I'm sure you will.

574
00:41:56,613 --> 00:42:00,128
You know, Jami's very nice
and not to mention beautiful.

575
00:42:02,173 --> 00:42:05,051
Leila, Jami is my employee.

576
00:42:06,573 --> 00:42:09,292
Have you ever seen The Sound Of Music?

577
00:42:10,253 --> 00:42:11,572
She worked for him.

578
00:42:11,653 --> 00:42:14,929
And their relationship
turned out pretty darn good.

579
00:42:21,453 --> 00:42:25,605
- Do you like The Sound Of Music?
- I love it. It's in my top 10.

580
00:42:26,173 --> 00:42:27,322
Good.

581
00:42:27,453 --> 00:42:30,525
I'd like to discuss it with you
over a martini.

582
00:42:31,573 --> 00:42:32,688
Okay.

583
00:42:34,413 --> 00:42:35,812
Hey, Leila.

584
00:42:38,533 --> 00:42:41,331
After Sunday,
I'm not going to see you anymore.

585
00:42:41,413 --> 00:42:44,132
I'm really excited to go back to work.

586
00:42:44,213 --> 00:42:45,965
I'm totally bummed.

587
00:42:47,013 --> 00:42:50,323
I've become the fifth wheel
and the lone astronomer.

588
00:42:55,613 --> 00:42:58,923
Why don't you come with us?
You know, work for your Uncle D.

589
00:43:00,813 --> 00:43:03,043
Am I ever going to see you again?

590
00:43:04,493 --> 00:43:05,892
Don't know.

591
00:43:12,893 --> 00:43:15,123
It was just to say good night.

592
00:43:15,933 --> 00:43:17,685
A handshake will do.

593
00:43:30,133 --> 00:43:32,124
Charli Hunter has returned.

594
00:43:32,213 --> 00:43:34,647
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

595
00:43:34,773 --> 00:43:38,209
- Ã molto bella.
- I feel the same way.

596
00:43:40,813 --> 00:43:45,204
- Che cos'Ã©, this little thing?
- This is a GPS monitor.

597
00:43:46,013 --> 00:43:49,608
- GP... What?
- A global positioning system.

598
00:43:52,173 --> 00:43:56,132
- Charli, I'm very glad you're back.
- Me, too.

599
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:18,851
And what are we doing now,
bird watching?

600
00:44:19,173 --> 00:44:20,686
We're beaming.

601
00:44:21,733 --> 00:44:24,611
We're not beaming,
but the satellite's beaming.

602
00:44:27,573 --> 00:44:30,087
But I'm beaming just the same.

603
00:44:32,733 --> 00:44:35,964
You, like me, appreciate moments.

604
00:44:36,973 --> 00:44:38,691
Moments like this.

605
00:44:39,573 --> 00:44:41,404
Moments. Si.

606
00:44:54,093 --> 00:44:56,129
- It works.
- Okay.

607
00:44:56,733 --> 00:44:58,212
So, let's go.

608
00:45:34,013 --> 00:45:37,050
- You're okay with this?
- Too late to turn back now.

609
00:45:37,133 --> 00:45:38,327
Mail call!

610
00:45:47,213 --> 00:45:49,681
Barcelona, Spain: Spanish.

611
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:52,004
Bangkok, Thailand: Thai.

612
00:45:53,173 --> 00:45:55,129
Beijing, China: Chinese.

613
00:45:55,693 --> 00:45:58,207
Planning equals smooth sailing.

614
00:45:58,813 --> 00:46:01,691
I should apologize to Leila. Right?

615
00:46:04,693 --> 00:46:06,923
You should apologize to Leila.

616
00:46:08,493 --> 00:46:09,642
Right?

617
00:46:18,773 --> 00:46:20,809
Okay, this is it.

618
00:46:20,893 --> 00:46:23,851
Four deliveries already.
We'll be done in no time.

619
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:27,722
Charli, you're very good.

620
00:46:28,533 --> 00:46:30,046
Don't thank me.

621
00:46:32,333 --> 00:46:34,927
The hem needs to be shorter,
at least an inch.

622
00:46:35,093 --> 00:46:36,651
I don't know. It doesn't work.

623
00:46:36,733 --> 00:46:40,009
- Jami, two inches for sure.
- Assolutamente no.

624
00:46:40,173 --> 00:46:43,245
The hem is just right.
Mr. Tortoni thinks it's perfect.

625
00:46:43,373 --> 00:46:45,682
- We've delivered the mail in record time.
- Yes.

626
00:46:45,773 --> 00:46:47,889
We'll do Jami, and we're done.

627
00:46:52,453 --> 00:46:55,843
- Very innovative.
- Innovation, I like.

628
00:46:57,333 --> 00:47:00,245
And efficient, no? I like that, too.

629
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:03,086
I totally concur
with signor Tortoni's assessment.

630
00:47:03,173 --> 00:47:05,687
Derek. Didn't expect to see you.

631
00:47:06,333 --> 00:47:09,086
- Hello, Mr. Hammond.
- Hello, Miss Martin.

632
00:47:09,213 --> 00:47:11,488
Leila, Dari, very creative.

633
00:47:12,933 --> 00:47:15,731
- We better get back to the mailroom.
- Wait a minute.

634
00:47:15,813 --> 00:47:18,327
We've got some future shoppers here.

635
00:47:18,413 --> 00:47:20,802
What do you think of the clothes?

636
00:47:22,213 --> 00:47:23,646
I love them.

637
00:47:24,173 --> 00:47:26,209
- Leila?
- They're nice.

638
00:47:27,613 --> 00:47:31,128
- Now, come on. The truth.
- Yes. Please enlighten us.

639
00:47:37,053 --> 00:47:40,523
Well, your target demographic is what?

640
00:47:41,013 --> 00:47:42,332
Eighteen to thirty?

641
00:47:42,413 --> 00:47:46,201
Young, stylish, carefree, but sophisticated.

642
00:47:47,293 --> 00:47:50,763
These clothes seem more geared
to an older audience...

643
00:47:50,853 --> 00:47:54,209
which is fine, but not really your target.

644
00:47:56,613 --> 00:47:58,331
But what do I know?

645
00:48:00,693 --> 00:48:02,968
Fine. Raise the hem two inches.

646
00:48:05,453 --> 00:48:07,762
Better get back to the mailroom.

647
00:48:13,653 --> 00:48:15,371
We have the fabric.

648
00:48:16,453 --> 00:48:19,889
So we're done
and two hours ahead of schedule.

649
00:48:20,533 --> 00:48:22,569
Let's head back to the office.

650
00:48:22,653 --> 00:48:26,168
They give us three hours to deliver it
and we do it in one.

651
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:30,611
Three hours minus one
gives us two hours to do as we please.

652
00:48:31,613 --> 00:48:34,605
Paolo, it's my first day back
from being fired.

653
00:48:34,693 --> 00:48:38,527
- And you're doing great. Follow me.
- Okay.

654
00:48:50,493 --> 00:48:54,042
And this is the Coliseum,
built 2,000 years ago.

655
00:48:54,373 --> 00:48:58,207
You know, 55,000 Romans
would fill this place.

656
00:48:58,973 --> 00:49:02,329
Men, and some women,
would battle to the death.

657
00:49:03,053 --> 00:49:04,691
Do you know this place?

658
00:49:04,773 --> 00:49:06,729
I saw Gladiator. Twice.

659
00:49:07,973 --> 00:49:09,406
Russell Crowe.

660
00:49:09,773 --> 00:49:12,765
Mamma mia!
I'm talking about real history.

661
00:49:13,173 --> 00:49:17,291
- So I suppose you never saw Gladiator.
- Four times.

662
00:50:18,533 --> 00:50:20,922
You know so much about Rome.

663
00:50:21,853 --> 00:50:23,366
I love it here.

664
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:26,929
So, then, why don't you
make the most of the program...

665
00:50:27,013 --> 00:50:30,449
so you can get a job with Hammond
in Rome in a few years?

666
00:50:30,693 --> 00:50:34,322
It's not what I want.
I have other interests and passions.

667
00:50:35,653 --> 00:50:38,645
- Like what?
- Come with me and I'll show you.

668
00:50:39,573 --> 00:50:40,722
Okay.

669
00:50:43,773 --> 00:50:45,729
And this is my passion.

670
00:50:46,253 --> 00:50:49,609
If you want to be a chef,
why are you in the program?

671
00:50:49,693 --> 00:50:51,923
Mr. Hammond likes to eat here.

672
00:50:52,053 --> 00:50:55,045
My father and my grandfather
were chefs here.

673
00:50:55,133 --> 00:50:57,601
But now they think it's no future for me.

674
00:51:03,053 --> 00:51:05,009
No. Okay, with your palms.

675
00:51:06,373 --> 00:51:08,967
Okay, this way. Don't press too much.

676
00:51:11,293 --> 00:51:13,966
Mamma mia! Ehi, Paolo!

677
00:51:19,453 --> 00:51:21,921
Okay, and now the fun part.

678
00:51:28,653 --> 00:51:30,245
I can't do that.

679
00:51:31,693 --> 00:51:35,447
Okay, fine. My first pizza toss.

680
00:51:37,573 --> 00:51:39,291
Charli, go for it.

681
00:51:46,333 --> 00:51:49,609
- Okay. It's no problem.
- Okay.

682
00:51:49,693 --> 00:51:53,163
We'll share my pizza,
and I'll make us pasta al pomodoro.

683
00:51:59,133 --> 00:52:00,646
I have an idea.

684
00:52:07,053 --> 00:52:09,089
- Buongiorno.
- Buongiorno.

685
00:52:31,573 --> 00:52:33,848
- Grazie, nonno.
- Prego.

686
00:52:35,973 --> 00:52:37,691
Tortoni will love this.

687
00:52:37,813 --> 00:52:41,010
I'll be so good,
Starbucks will be recruiting me.

688
00:52:42,853 --> 00:52:44,809
Star... Who?

689
00:52:56,973 --> 00:53:00,045
- Surprise!
- Yeah, I'm surprised.

690
00:53:00,853 --> 00:53:02,127
What are you doing here?

691
00:53:02,213 --> 00:53:04,773
I took the train up.
I thought maybe we could go out.

692
00:53:04,853 --> 00:53:06,206
- Now?
- Yeah.

693
00:53:07,293 --> 00:53:08,282
No.

694
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:12,323
It's Rome. It's summer.
And we both have nothing to do.

695
00:53:13,533 --> 00:53:15,285
I'm not interested.

696
00:53:15,933 --> 00:53:20,085
I was going to take you for the best
gelato, I mean, ice cream, in the world.

697
00:53:21,293 --> 00:53:22,965
In the whole world?

698
00:53:28,933 --> 00:53:32,687
- Do you have a favorite ice cream?
- No. I have about five favorites.

699
00:53:32,773 --> 00:53:35,810
This gelato's going to be 10 times better.

700
00:53:36,293 --> 00:53:38,523
- Trust me.
- Trust you?

701
00:53:38,773 --> 00:53:40,809
Sorry. Taste for yourself.

702
00:53:44,413 --> 00:53:47,246
- You were right.
- The best ice cream ever.

703
00:53:48,493 --> 00:53:50,529
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

704
00:53:52,693 --> 00:53:55,810
- So, I need you to tell me something.
- Okay.

705
00:53:56,613 --> 00:53:59,332
Be honest. Why don't you really like me?

706
00:53:59,413 --> 00:54:02,211
- I like you.
- Come on, be serious.

707
00:54:03,893 --> 00:54:07,602
We only have two hours and there's not
really enough time to explain that one.

708
00:54:07,693 --> 00:54:10,491
Ouch! Am I that bad?

709
00:54:11,893 --> 00:54:14,327
Come on. Now you have to tell me.

710
00:54:14,853 --> 00:54:16,491
Fine. Here goes.

711
00:54:16,933 --> 00:54:20,926
You're spoiled, sort of obnoxious,
and kind of...

712
00:54:22,253 --> 00:54:24,892
- arrogant.
- Don't sugarcoat it, please.

713
00:54:24,973 --> 00:54:28,170
And the clincher is
you're happy being that way.

714
00:54:28,573 --> 00:54:30,325
Okay, I don't mean to be harsh...

715
00:54:30,413 --> 00:54:34,247
but your uncle would be so happy
if you just join the program.

716
00:54:35,213 --> 00:54:37,443
Or just do something
more challenging than...

717
00:54:37,533 --> 00:54:40,093
apply SPF 25, everyday, all day.

718
00:54:40,333 --> 00:54:42,688
That's why he invited me to Italy
for the summer.

719
00:54:42,773 --> 00:54:45,924
He wants to instill
some sort of work ethic in me.

720
00:54:46,093 --> 00:54:48,209
But I'm never going to be like him.

721
00:54:48,453 --> 00:54:50,648
So it's, why bother trying?

722
00:54:50,813 --> 00:54:52,212
I'm only 17.

723
00:54:53,733 --> 00:54:57,965
You're right. You should just play
with your uncle's toys all summer.

724
00:55:23,013 --> 00:55:25,447
Do the kids know we're seeing each other?

725
00:55:25,533 --> 00:55:27,489
Why? Am I not supposed to say anything?

726
00:55:27,573 --> 00:55:31,691
Kissing, and you and I dating,
that's something I wanted.

727
00:55:32,813 --> 00:55:36,044
I just don't know if it's something
I want the kids to see.

728
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:41,090
You're right. We're the example,
so I guess we should keep it to ourselves.

729
00:55:42,893 --> 00:55:45,123
Charli and Paolo have a flirtation.

730
00:55:45,213 --> 00:55:48,011
I think Nobu and Dari have something, too.

731
00:55:48,093 --> 00:55:49,924
Our interns are not here to date.

732
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:52,368
They're here to work
and learn about work.

733
00:55:52,453 --> 00:55:54,887
And, quite frankly, to impress us.

734
00:55:55,733 --> 00:55:56,882
But...

735
00:55:57,613 --> 00:56:01,765
I know how difficult it is
to put aside feelings.

736
00:56:03,933 --> 00:56:06,163
We've been doing it for years.

737
00:56:07,413 --> 00:56:10,371
It was difficult for me today at the office.

738
00:56:11,453 --> 00:56:13,648
We're not in the office now.

739
00:56:20,773 --> 00:56:24,652
This is delicious.
I mean, you're a great chef.

740
00:56:25,893 --> 00:56:26,882
Grazie.

741
00:56:28,893 --> 00:56:32,647
If this is what you want
to do with your life, do it.

742
00:56:35,453 --> 00:56:38,013
Why don't you show Mr. Hammond
your sketches?

743
00:56:38,133 --> 00:56:41,250
- They're molto belli.
- You've seen my sketches?

744
00:56:42,933 --> 00:56:46,721
My sister and I are interested in fashion
and that's why we're here.

745
00:56:46,813 --> 00:56:48,883
But we also know our place.

746
00:56:50,893 --> 00:56:53,361
My espresso is world-class.

747
00:56:54,013 --> 00:56:58,006
My pizza, on the other hand,
is now unfortunately a ceiling tile.

748
00:56:59,653 --> 00:57:03,931
Someone famous once said,
"What goes up, must come down."

749
00:57:05,013 --> 00:57:06,765
They don't know you.

750
00:57:48,893 --> 00:57:52,727
Did all 180 employees suddenly
leave the building for their break?

751
00:57:52,813 --> 00:57:54,644
I hear someone coming.

752
00:57:55,413 --> 00:57:58,689
Sorry. The break
should have started 10 minutes ago.

753
00:58:03,733 --> 00:58:06,486
Okay. I don't usually care
much for this stuff...

754
00:58:06,573 --> 00:58:09,292
but for my interns, I will be a pioneer.

755
00:58:09,373 --> 00:58:11,204
Or a sacrificial lamb.

756
00:58:18,773 --> 00:58:21,571
Mr. Tortoni, I will let you be the judge.

757
00:58:34,693 --> 00:58:38,322
Perfetto. This is old-world delicious.

758
00:58:38,493 --> 00:58:41,132
Just like my grandfather used to make.

759
00:58:41,213 --> 00:58:42,532
If he only knew.

760
00:58:43,413 --> 00:58:44,892
Excellent, Charli.

761
00:58:45,733 --> 00:58:48,531
I think this is going to be a great summer.

762
00:59:34,013 --> 00:59:36,208
Mail call! Mail call!

763
01:00:08,613 --> 01:00:10,683
I have to give you a raise.

764
01:00:11,413 --> 01:00:13,005
What? I love this car.

765
01:00:13,093 --> 01:00:15,812
Besides, with the parking in Rome,
it's perfect.

766
01:00:16,013 --> 01:00:17,969
But I'll take the raise.

767
01:00:18,533 --> 01:00:20,251
I love St. Peter's.

768
01:00:21,493 --> 01:00:23,085
So much history.

769
01:00:23,533 --> 01:00:24,761
Like us.

770
01:00:26,253 --> 01:00:29,211
Derek, I'm thinking
of quitting your company.

771
01:00:30,653 --> 01:00:32,689
The company is secondary.

772
01:00:33,533 --> 01:00:35,728
The most important thing is you and I.

773
01:00:35,813 --> 01:00:38,088
But maybe we can have it all.

774
01:00:39,733 --> 01:00:41,803
Let's start a new history.

775
01:00:42,173 --> 01:00:46,086
I'm going ballooning tomorrow
in the French Alps. Come with me.

776
01:00:47,533 --> 01:00:48,648
Ballooning?

777
01:00:48,973 --> 01:00:52,807
- Like, way up high?
- Way, way up high.

778
01:00:56,933 --> 01:01:00,721
Can we start a new history
when you get back from ballooning?

779
01:01:02,373 --> 01:01:03,806
It's a date.

780
01:01:08,253 --> 01:01:09,925
Come on. Let's go.

781
01:01:12,413 --> 01:01:15,291
I can't believe
you've got me playing hooky.

782
01:01:31,773 --> 01:01:35,652
- Leila.
- Buongiorno, signor Tortoni.

783
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:41,411
- Just delivering your mail.
- With ingenuity and style, I might add.

784
01:01:41,653 --> 01:01:45,009
Thank you. I better get going.

785
01:01:45,133 --> 01:01:46,452
Wait one moment.

786
01:01:46,533 --> 01:01:50,003
I want you to know that I'm very pleased
with the hard work...

787
01:01:50,093 --> 01:01:52,482
that you and Charli have shown.

788
01:01:52,573 --> 01:01:56,486
You have proven the termination wrong,
and for that, I am glad.

789
01:01:57,493 --> 01:02:00,565
Thank you for a second chance.
Have a good day.

790
01:02:00,653 --> 01:02:02,086
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

791
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:21,564
- Hello?
- Ryan, I need you to come to Rome.

792
01:02:22,013 --> 01:02:25,244
Is it a date? I thought
you couldn't stand the sight of me.

793
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:28,291
No, for work.
It'll be your first summer job.

794
01:02:28,533 --> 01:02:29,886
A job, job?

795
01:02:31,053 --> 01:02:34,409
Ryan, do something productive
and gain some respect.

796
01:02:34,773 --> 01:02:36,365
At least for me.

797
01:02:36,733 --> 01:02:40,408
- That means something, right?
- Leila, it means everything.

798
01:02:40,893 --> 01:02:43,487
Good. I'm looking forward to it. Ciao.

799
01:02:54,333 --> 01:02:56,972
When will they tell us
who's going to New York?

800
01:02:57,053 --> 01:02:58,566
Leila for sure.

801
01:02:58,653 --> 01:03:03,169
I would go to New York for one reason:
To sample the pizza.

802
01:03:04,733 --> 01:03:06,485
Guys, guys. Tortoni.

803
01:03:06,693 --> 01:03:11,244
Interns, the clothes
for the magazine shoot must be cleaned.

804
01:03:13,013 --> 01:03:16,688
The cleaners is only a short way,
so you can walk it there.

805
01:03:17,813 --> 01:03:20,327
Wait for the clothes to be cleaned.

806
01:03:20,853 --> 01:03:23,686
Two hours maximum
and bring them back.

807
01:03:23,893 --> 01:03:26,805
- Do you trust these cleaners?
- For 11 years.

808
01:03:28,733 --> 01:03:30,963
What if they ruin the clothes?

809
01:03:31,653 --> 01:03:33,291
Too much worrying.

810
01:03:33,373 --> 01:03:37,207
You have done such a great job
I have decided to treat you to lunch...

811
01:03:37,293 --> 01:03:40,330
at my favorite cafÃ©
on the way to the cleaners.

812
01:03:40,413 --> 01:03:43,325
And I know that teenagers
like to be with teenagers...

813
01:03:43,413 --> 01:03:46,007
so lunch is just for you.
Everything is taken care of.

814
01:03:46,093 --> 01:03:48,891
Go, eat, and enjoy. Ciao.

815
01:03:51,053 --> 01:03:53,123
We'll bring you leftovers.

816
01:03:54,373 --> 01:03:56,682
Sorry, I'll be a little late for lunch.

817
01:03:56,773 --> 01:04:01,563
I saw a pair of shoes on the via Condotti
and I must get them before they're gone.

818
01:04:02,493 --> 01:04:04,961
Women and shopping. It never ends.

819
01:04:10,173 --> 01:04:13,802
- Charli, where's Leila?
- She's out to lunch with Ryan.

820
01:04:14,373 --> 01:04:16,841
She is lucky. We get the bad jobs.

821
01:04:17,413 --> 01:04:19,643
No. I mean, we're interns.

822
01:04:19,733 --> 01:04:22,327
Mailroom interns. This is what we do.

823
01:04:23,093 --> 01:04:25,163
You have the best attitude.

824
01:04:25,253 --> 01:04:28,643
You and your sister
are going to get asked to New York, I bet.

825
01:04:49,053 --> 01:04:51,567
Hanging with you is not really work.

826
01:04:51,693 --> 01:04:53,729
- Are you on the beach?
- No.

827
01:04:54,613 --> 01:04:56,649
- Are you my driver?
- Yeah.

828
01:04:58,053 --> 01:05:00,726
Then you are officially employed, Ryan.

829
01:05:03,253 --> 01:05:05,448
Everyone bailed on this lunch.

830
01:05:05,533 --> 01:05:08,491
- Paolo had to work at his restaurant.
- Yeah, but Dari?

831
01:05:08,573 --> 01:05:11,451
I can't believe she'd miss out
on a free lunch for shoes.

832
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:13,091
Depends on the shoes.

833
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:16,371
You must be Mr. Tortoni's special guests.

834
01:05:17,053 --> 01:05:19,851
- Just three of you?
- Yeah.

835
01:05:20,093 --> 01:05:24,086
Okay, he has arranged everything.
The antipasto buffet is inside.

836
01:05:25,333 --> 01:05:28,609
- What should we do with the clothes?
- No problem. I'll watch them.

837
01:05:28,693 --> 01:05:30,729
Don't worry. Ci penso io.

838
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:33,527
Okay. Grazie.

839
01:05:35,813 --> 01:05:39,488
- We can't forget to bring Gianni leftovers.
- Yeah, leftovers.

840
01:05:40,293 --> 01:05:43,012
So do you have
just a little bit of respect for me now?

841
01:05:43,093 --> 01:05:45,163
I have a little respect for you.

842
01:05:45,253 --> 01:05:48,404
Was that "a little respect",
or "little respect"?

843
01:05:48,493 --> 01:05:51,212
There's a big difference. Which is it?

844
01:05:51,293 --> 01:05:53,363
I need to get these shots.

845
01:06:08,013 --> 01:06:09,492
This food looks great.

846
01:06:09,573 --> 01:06:12,451
In Rome there's no such thing
as a bad meal.

847
01:06:13,973 --> 01:06:16,487
- That Tortoni is a real sport.
- Yeah.

848
01:06:16,613 --> 01:06:19,366
I think we had him all wrong. I like him.

849
01:06:19,533 --> 01:06:23,003
- Yeah. He's pretty cool.
- Mangiamo.

850
01:06:27,693 --> 01:06:30,924
- Oh, my gosh. The clothes!
- Oh, no!

851
01:06:34,653 --> 01:06:36,609
Tortoni's going to flip!

852
01:06:59,453 --> 01:07:01,728
- Where is Leila?
- I don't know.

853
01:07:02,653 --> 01:07:04,052
Interesting.

854
01:07:04,413 --> 01:07:06,973
Fillitti is unreachable.
He's shooting swimwear...

855
01:07:07,053 --> 01:07:09,647
on some Fijian island.
And I can't track Mr. Hammond.

856
01:07:09,733 --> 01:07:11,883
He's hot air ballooning
over the French Alps.

857
01:07:11,973 --> 01:07:13,565
So it's my call.

858
01:07:13,653 --> 01:07:16,884
I think we should wait
until we talk to Mr. Hammond.

859
01:07:16,973 --> 01:07:20,932
I think you should know your place
in this company, Miss Martin.

860
01:07:22,093 --> 01:07:25,608
I have one thing to say to you
and your missing friends.

861
01:07:26,053 --> 01:07:27,532
You're fired.

862
01:07:28,653 --> 01:07:32,566
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have your many mistakes to correct.

863
01:07:36,413 --> 01:07:39,246
Those designs took over a year of my life.

864
01:07:40,173 --> 01:07:41,606
We're sorry.

865
01:07:42,613 --> 01:07:43,762
We're really sorry.

866
01:07:43,853 --> 01:07:46,128
Just none of this makes sense!

867
01:07:46,293 --> 01:07:50,047
I wish we had an explanation.
I mean, or a solution.

868
01:07:51,813 --> 01:07:53,326
Yeah, I do, too.

869
01:07:59,933 --> 01:08:02,811
This isn't the way
I wanted to say goodbye.

870
01:08:23,013 --> 01:08:25,129
We are so, how do you say, lame?

871
01:08:25,773 --> 01:08:28,890
No, that's putting it kindly.
I was fired twice.

872
01:08:28,973 --> 01:08:32,124
I mean, when Leila finds out,
she's going to freak.

873
01:08:32,613 --> 01:08:35,286
I have a flight to Munich in two hours.

874
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:39,043
Of course. Rats are always
the first to leave a burning ship.

875
01:08:39,133 --> 01:08:41,647
Nobu, I hope to never see you again.

876
01:08:41,933 --> 01:08:43,764
Absolutely no problem.

877
01:08:45,573 --> 01:08:48,326
Hi. God, I'm glad you're still here.

878
01:08:48,733 --> 01:08:50,689
I wanted to have a real farewell.

879
01:08:50,773 --> 01:08:53,924
I'm not ready to say my goodbyes.

880
01:08:57,253 --> 01:09:00,086
I had this crazy idea.

881
01:09:01,013 --> 01:09:02,128
Okay.

882
01:09:05,053 --> 01:09:07,886
We'll set up the fashion shoot ourselves.

883
01:09:09,733 --> 01:09:11,689
Yes, that qualifies as crazy.

884
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:13,604
Charli, we were fired.

885
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:16,201
There's no clothes.
There's no fashion shoot.

886
01:09:16,293 --> 01:09:18,727
Which part of this fiasco
haven't you grasped yet?

887
01:09:18,813 --> 01:09:21,088
Okay, but I have my sketchbook.

888
01:09:21,413 --> 01:09:24,007
And we know where to get the fabrics.

889
01:09:24,413 --> 01:09:26,369
I mean, we have three days.

890
01:09:26,453 --> 01:09:30,082
Charli, I respect your initiative
and your enterprise...

891
01:09:30,173 --> 01:09:32,164
We are wasting our time.

892
01:09:32,253 --> 01:09:34,767
Okay. Maybe you guys are right.

893
01:09:35,213 --> 01:09:38,922
Maybe I have totally,
completely lost my mind, but...

894
01:09:39,013 --> 01:09:41,083
No, you know what? Look...

895
01:09:41,853 --> 01:09:44,925
I could help you make your clothes
and when Fillitti gets here...

896
01:09:45,013 --> 01:09:47,811
I could convince him to shoot your stuff.

897
01:09:48,013 --> 01:09:51,892
It's out there, but sometimes the best
ideas are the most unconventional.

898
01:09:51,973 --> 01:09:54,931
Let's put to use
what we learned this summer.

899
01:09:55,533 --> 01:09:58,206
Okay. I'm ready to roll up my sleeves.

900
01:09:58,293 --> 01:09:59,442
Me, too.

901
01:09:59,533 --> 01:10:02,570
I guess I can reschedule my flight.

902
01:10:03,053 --> 01:10:05,487
Good. Because you don't want
to miss this.

903
01:10:05,613 --> 01:10:07,604
- Ryan, what are you doing here?
- Working.

904
01:10:07,693 --> 01:10:08,762
You?

905
01:10:09,773 --> 01:10:10,888
Yeah.

906
01:10:11,613 --> 01:10:16,129
Okay. We're going to produce our own
fashion line using Charli's designs.

907
01:10:16,213 --> 01:10:17,612
Don't you want to know why?

908
01:10:17,693 --> 01:10:21,163
Because the real clothes were stolen
and you got fired.

909
01:10:22,533 --> 01:10:24,569
- Ryan, the evidence.
- Yeah.

910
01:10:26,413 --> 01:10:30,042
Signor Tortoni has been sabotaging
Mr. Hammond for years.

911
01:10:30,133 --> 01:10:32,522
He set you up for the fall
and he stole the clothes.

912
01:10:32,613 --> 01:10:36,162
With Mr. Hammond jetting around
the world, Tortoni's had the opportunity.

913
01:10:36,253 --> 01:10:38,847
Something you don't want to give
a jealous, corrupt man.

914
01:10:38,933 --> 01:10:41,766
He wants to embarrass Uncle D.
In front of the fashion world.

915
01:10:41,853 --> 01:10:43,002
I won't let that happen.

916
01:10:43,093 --> 01:10:47,086
- When do we bust Tortoni?
- No, we'll leave that for Mr. Hammond.

917
01:10:47,413 --> 01:10:50,325
- And the photo shoot?
- What photo shoot?

918
01:10:50,853 --> 01:10:54,766
Well, my sketches
are going to become reality.

919
01:10:55,813 --> 01:10:57,246
I say we move ahead.

920
01:10:57,333 --> 01:11:00,962
You heard the lady. Let's quit
goofing around and get back to work.

921
01:12:36,813 --> 01:12:38,371
What are you doing here?

922
01:12:38,453 --> 01:12:41,331
Working, Uncle D.
For Hammond International.

923
01:12:42,573 --> 01:12:44,882
Come on, guys!
Everybody get up. We got to go.

924
01:12:44,973 --> 01:12:47,487
We got a photo shoot to take care of.
Come on, guys.

925
01:12:47,573 --> 01:12:49,609
I've created a workaholic.

926
01:12:50,093 --> 01:12:52,163
I guess you found Plan C.

927
01:12:52,573 --> 01:12:53,688
Thank you.

928
01:12:53,893 --> 01:12:57,329
Mr. Hammond,
we were just working on a project.

929
01:12:58,053 --> 01:12:59,611
Charli, your...

930
01:13:01,213 --> 01:13:03,283
Your designs are exquisite.

931
01:13:03,813 --> 01:13:04,928
Thank you.

932
01:13:05,133 --> 01:13:07,283
Sir, you knew about Tortoni.

933
01:13:08,053 --> 01:13:09,725
For several years.

934
01:13:09,813 --> 01:13:12,930
He's been doing a few shady things.
Small stuff.

935
01:13:13,013 --> 01:13:15,971
But unfortunately I have this loyalty thing.

936
01:13:17,053 --> 01:13:19,362
He wants to be you, Mr. Hammond.

937
01:13:21,693 --> 01:13:23,809
You still loyal to Tortoni?

938
01:13:24,253 --> 01:13:25,891
No. Not anymore.

939
01:13:26,533 --> 01:13:30,208
- Let's take him down.
- We will, but timing is everything.

940
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:34,724
- Okay, team, let's get back to work.
- There you go.

941
01:14:07,573 --> 01:14:10,133
- This is big-time fun.
- Better than your toys?

942
01:14:10,213 --> 01:14:13,091
Yeah. Thanks for helping me
get it together.

943
01:14:19,813 --> 01:14:21,963
My team did good. Very good.

944
01:14:22,053 --> 01:14:25,807
Derek, I'm so glad you called.
The shoot looks terrific, no?

945
01:14:26,053 --> 01:14:30,046
As you know, such an unfortunate thing
happened with the clothes. They vanished.

946
01:14:30,133 --> 01:14:32,283
In the heat of the moment,
I blamed the kids.

947
01:14:32,373 --> 01:14:34,603
But it was no one's fault, no?

948
01:14:35,093 --> 01:14:38,768
Summer interns, look,
I am so sorry about my overreaction.

949
01:14:38,893 --> 01:14:43,284
I want to rehire all of you and give
everyone a special summer-ending bonus.

950
01:14:43,373 --> 01:14:45,011
Enrico, stop.

951
01:14:46,293 --> 01:14:48,853
- I know what you did.
- Me, Derek?

952
01:14:53,653 --> 01:14:54,802
What?

953
01:14:58,533 --> 01:15:02,128
Look. Twelve years of living
in your shadow.

954
01:15:03,133 --> 01:15:05,442
You got the glory and the girl.

955
01:15:06,893 --> 01:15:09,168
- And I... I got...
- A lot.

956
01:15:09,773 --> 01:15:12,162
And then you got greedy.

957
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:18,248
You're not going to fire me?

958
01:15:19,093 --> 01:15:20,128
No.

959
01:15:21,613 --> 01:15:23,569
I'm having you arrested.

960
01:15:25,573 --> 01:15:28,724
Look, you know it's not my way
to do it in public.

961
01:15:28,813 --> 01:15:31,043
They're waiting for you
at the police station.

962
01:15:31,133 --> 01:15:33,772
I've arranged a car to take you there.

963
01:15:46,253 --> 01:15:48,084
- Ciao!
- Arrivederci!

964
01:15:48,173 --> 01:15:50,482
The coffee in prison is instant!

965
01:15:57,533 --> 01:16:00,366
So, Derek, what about
New York next summer?

966
01:16:02,093 --> 01:16:05,563
I have a philosophy.
You never break up a winning team.

967
01:16:07,013 --> 01:16:10,210
I want all of you with me
in New York next summer.

968
01:16:11,533 --> 01:16:13,967
You, I want for life.

969
01:16:19,613 --> 01:16:22,844
- So, you coming to New York?
- On business.

970
01:16:23,293 --> 01:16:26,968
I'll check out the pizza and the pasta.
Get some ideas.

971
01:16:32,333 --> 01:16:35,450
Leila, you know what they say,
"When in Rome..."

972
01:16:35,733 --> 01:16:39,009
Ryan, it's a nice clichÃ©, but a hug will do.

973
01:17:02,213 --> 01:17:06,092
Your magazine promotes
your fashions and your...

974
01:17:06,453 --> 01:17:09,604
And you push
your magazine and musics...

975
01:17:10,573 --> 01:17:11,847
Musics!

976
01:17:11,933 --> 01:17:14,527
Well, you know. What's her name?

977
01:17:14,613 --> 01:17:18,367
He wants to be you, Mr. Hammond, cut.

978
01:17:18,733 --> 01:17:21,611
And I want you all to come next...

979
01:17:21,733 --> 01:17:25,646
And I want you all to come with me
next summer. And I want...

980
01:17:26,733 --> 01:17:31,204
You know, 55 Romans...
Sorry, 55,000 Romans...

981
01:17:31,293 --> 01:17:32,885
Okay, I'll say it again.

982
01:17:33,013 --> 01:17:37,484
Men and some women... I am sorry.

983
01:17:38,893 --> 01:17:40,212
What are we doing?

984
01:17:40,293 --> 01:17:42,887
Well, this gelato will be 10 times better.
Trust me.

985
01:17:42,973 --> 01:17:46,932
Senta, quanto dura ancora, scusi?
Eh, io c'ho da lavora'.

986
01:17:48,093 --> 01:17:51,927
Sir, it's... Natan's phone.

987
01:17:52,013 --> 01:17:54,686
I don't usually care for this stuff,
but for my interns...

988
01:17:54,773 --> 01:17:56,252
I will be a sacrificial...

989
01:17:56,333 --> 01:17:57,322
Sorry!

990
01:18:02,333 --> 01:18:03,971
You are so Americana.

991
01:18:05,093 --> 01:18:07,448
We need you, man. You need...

992
01:18:07,533 --> 01:18:10,525
- You're doing great. Follow me.
- Okay.

993
01:18:14,613 --> 01:18:16,092
I don't know.

994
01:18:16,413 --> 01:18:17,402
We'll be fine.

995
01:18:17,493 --> 01:18:21,281
And maybe
we'll even meet Giorgio Armani.

996
01:18:21,853 --> 01:18:24,413
Hammond's seven "C's".
I remember them well.

997
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:33,568
Buongiorno, signor Tortoni.

998
01:18:35,373 --> 01:18:39,412
I was just delivering your mail.
That was really bad, I should do it again.

999
01:18:39,893 --> 01:18:44,045
Buongiorno, Satorni, what?

1000
01:18:44,133 --> 01:18:45,486
Go for it.

1001
01:18:50,893 --> 01:18:53,965
Sort of obnoxious and kind of...

1002
01:18:55,093 --> 01:18:56,003
arrogant.

1003
01:18:56,093 --> 01:18:57,811
Sorry, I will do it again.

1004
01:18:57,893 --> 01:18:59,212
Go for it.

1005
01:19:02,333 --> 01:19:04,563
Sorry, I just lost all my lines.

1006
01:19:04,653 --> 01:19:08,566
Concentrate on doing things right
and you'll do them right.

1007
01:19:08,653 --> 01:19:10,609
Easy for you to say.

1008
01:19:10,693 --> 01:19:13,446
Maybe you work at customs at the airport.

1009
01:19:13,533 --> 01:19:16,366
Mr. Tortoni, I'll let you be the judge.

1010
01:19:20,733 --> 01:19:21,722
Perfetto.

1011
01:19:21,813 --> 01:19:25,044
This is when... About two years ago.

1012
01:19:25,133 --> 01:19:26,930
Hammond did...

1013
01:19:27,413 --> 01:19:28,892
We'll do that again.

1014
01:19:29,413 --> 01:19:30,766
Press release...

1015
01:19:30,853 --> 01:19:31,842
Mi dispiace.

1016
01:19:34,213 --> 01:19:35,931
I forgot my line.

I'm having you arrested.

Look, you know it's not my way

I've arranged a car to take you there.

1023
01:21:41,764 --> 01:21:43,117
We pulled it off, Derek.

1024
01:21:45,004 --> 01:21:46,437
To perfection.

1025
01:21:47,844 --> 01:21:48,833
Pulled what off?

1026
01:21:49,284 --> 01:21:52,515
This clothes-stealing incident was a hoax
to see how you'd react.

1027
01:21:52,884 --> 01:21:53,919
Gotcha.

1028
01:21:57,804 --> 01:22:01,274
Wait. So this whole thing was a test?

1029
01:22:01,884 --> 01:22:03,237
Yes, it was.

1030
01:22:03,324 --> 01:22:04,996
And how'd we do?

1031
01:22:05,484 --> 01:22:07,042
I would give you an A+.

1032
01:22:08,044 --> 01:22:10,683
And I want you all to come with me
and Jami...

1033
01:22:11,644 --> 01:22:13,077
to New York next summer.

1034
01:22:16,204 --> 01:22:17,432
We're not interested.

1035
01:22:18,604 --> 01:22:20,003
- What?
- You're not?

1036
01:22:21,524 --> 01:22:22,639
Gotcha!

1037
01:22:22,924 --> 01:22:24,516
Yeah, you got us!

1038
01:22:25,804 --> 01:22:27,283
When in Rome...

1039
01:22:48,253 --> 01:22:50,289
We're shooting the opening to the movie.

1040
01:22:51,093 --> 01:22:52,492
And action!

1041
01:22:54,213 --> 01:22:56,886
I'm so tired I could stay here all day.

1042
01:22:57,133 --> 01:22:58,566
Our movie is about...

1043
01:22:58,773 --> 01:23:02,049
Our characters, Charli and Leila,
go to Rome...

1044
01:23:02,413 --> 01:23:04,324
to be in this intern program.

1045
01:23:04,773 --> 01:23:07,082
And we mess up.

1046
01:23:07,893 --> 01:23:09,406
We do some great things.

1047
01:23:09,493 --> 01:23:12,087
We're along with four other interns.

1048
01:23:12,213 --> 01:23:13,692
We just basically have fun.

1049
01:23:17,133 --> 01:23:19,601
My character is very excited to be here.

1050
01:23:19,693 --> 01:23:22,287
Her name's Leila and she's very excited
to go to Rome.

1051
01:23:22,373 --> 01:23:23,692
Mail call!

1052
01:23:24,293 --> 01:23:26,363
She's really into the whole fashion thing.

1053
01:23:26,453 --> 01:23:27,442
Mail call!

1054
01:23:31,093 --> 01:23:32,412
I'm doing tricks now.

1055
01:23:36,093 --> 01:23:37,208
Oh, no!

1056
01:23:38,533 --> 01:23:40,012
You don't drop it.

1057
01:23:40,773 --> 01:23:42,331
- What happened?
- I almost fell.

1058
01:23:42,853 --> 01:23:44,684
My character in the movie is Charli.

1059
01:23:45,053 --> 01:23:49,205
She's always sketching.
Her passion is designing clothes.

1060
01:23:49,653 --> 01:23:54,090
She kinda gets a really big crush on Paolo.

1061
01:23:54,173 --> 01:23:58,724
I met Micky, but I can't say his name right,
Michelangelo.

1062
01:23:58,893 --> 01:24:03,967
My name in reality is Michelangelo,
and in the movie I'm going to be Paolo.

1063
01:24:04,093 --> 01:24:06,163
- I am Paolo.
- I'm impressed.

1064
01:24:06,693 --> 01:24:09,491
He was very sweet, very nice.

1065
01:24:09,613 --> 01:24:12,173
The character is going to be
a beautiful character...

1066
01:24:12,253 --> 01:24:15,006
according to me,
because I'm gonna be a very quiet person.

1067
01:24:15,453 --> 01:24:17,648
He's Italian
and he's trying to speak English.

1068
01:24:17,733 --> 01:24:21,442
It's funny when he doesn't know how
to say the words because he gets hyper.

1069
01:24:21,613 --> 01:24:24,286
In my life,
I'm a little bit stressed about all this.

1070
01:24:24,653 --> 01:24:27,884
He works on a "serial."
That's what they call soap operas.

1071
01:24:28,133 --> 01:24:29,361
Right. Just this.

1072
01:24:29,453 --> 01:24:31,569
This scene is about...

1073
01:24:32,533 --> 01:24:35,525
We run into each other and we first meet.

1074
01:24:37,293 --> 01:24:38,851
Then we introduce ourselves.

1075
01:24:39,253 --> 01:24:40,242
Action.

1076
01:24:48,173 --> 01:24:49,970
I forgot my line.

1077
01:24:50,133 --> 01:24:53,808
He takes me and shows me around Rome.

1078
01:24:54,053 --> 01:24:56,328
He teaches me how to make pizza.

1079
01:24:56,413 --> 01:24:58,449
I'm making pizza!

1080
01:25:01,253 --> 01:25:04,609
And then, to do a pizza toss
you put your hand like this.

1081
01:25:10,933 --> 01:25:12,844
Yo! You got it, girlfriend!

1082
01:25:28,013 --> 01:25:29,241
You need some flour?

1083
01:25:29,933 --> 01:25:31,764
- She loves me.
- I love him.

1084
01:25:32,213 --> 01:25:34,363
- This is llenia, and she plays Dari.
- Hi!

1085
01:25:34,453 --> 01:25:37,206
And this is Valentina, and she plays Heidi.

1086
01:25:37,533 --> 01:25:42,766
I am a little bit crazy
because I put toothpaste on my hair.

1087
01:25:42,933 --> 01:25:44,844
I'm so crazy.

1088
01:25:45,533 --> 01:25:47,171
- This is Daria.
- Ciao.

1089
01:25:48,693 --> 01:25:50,888
I'm very selfish and...

1090
01:25:53,493 --> 01:25:54,767
- Mean.
...mean.

1091
01:25:54,853 --> 01:25:56,411
You caused the CD mess!

1092
01:25:56,773 --> 01:25:58,491
That's not what Tortoni thinks.

1093
01:25:58,613 --> 01:26:01,969
It is a great school for my English
and for my work.

1094
01:26:02,053 --> 01:26:03,202
And I like it.

1095
01:26:03,573 --> 01:26:06,531
I want to improve my English every day...

1096
01:26:06,613 --> 01:26:09,252
and this is a very good way.

1097
01:26:09,333 --> 01:26:12,928
I like you and your sister...

1098
01:26:13,013 --> 01:26:15,686
because you don't act like stars.

1099
01:26:16,213 --> 01:26:20,047
You are more simple, more friendly.

1100
01:26:20,573 --> 01:26:24,851
Yes! Because you are so beautiful,
so good.

1101
01:26:24,933 --> 01:26:25,922
Thank you!

1102
01:26:29,093 --> 01:26:33,609
I'm here with Derek,
and he plays Ryan, my love interest.

1103
01:26:34,413 --> 01:26:37,405
- Not so love.
- Not so love. Yeah.

1104
01:26:37,493 --> 01:26:41,122
Ryan is an arrogant, sort of obnoxious...

1105
01:26:42,373 --> 01:26:43,647
bad boy from New York.

1106
01:26:51,933 --> 01:26:53,161
Are you crazy?

1107
01:26:53,253 --> 01:26:56,131
I didn't expect to see you.
There's not usually people around.

1108
01:26:56,413 --> 01:26:57,732
We're on the beach...

1109
01:26:58,093 --> 01:27:00,004
and it's not beach weather.

1110
01:27:00,813 --> 01:27:02,246
Are my lips purple yet?

1111
01:27:03,333 --> 01:27:06,405
And he meets Ashley, who is Leila.

1112
01:27:07,053 --> 01:27:11,410
I'm really into her
and she's not into me, unfortunately.

1113
01:27:15,173 --> 01:27:17,243
This was my first on-screen kiss.

1114
01:27:18,133 --> 01:27:22,172
It was very nerve-wracking, actually,
because it's with Ashley Olsen.

1115
01:27:22,773 --> 01:27:23,762
Please.

1116
01:27:23,853 --> 01:27:26,845
I'm with my friend Archie. He plays Nobu.

1117
01:27:26,973 --> 01:27:29,168
Have you had a chance
to do any sightseeing?

1118
01:27:29,293 --> 01:27:31,011
- Oh, yeah.
- What's your favorite?

1119
01:27:31,573 --> 01:27:32,801
My favorite?

1120
01:27:34,053 --> 01:27:35,964
I don't know. I've seen a lot of ruins.

1121
01:27:36,093 --> 01:27:38,004
There's no shortage of ruins in Rome.

1122
01:27:38,093 --> 01:27:39,731
Every street corner has a ruin.

1123
01:27:39,853 --> 01:27:42,242
My favorite sight in Rome so far...

1124
01:27:43,573 --> 01:27:45,370
is probably the Spanish Steps.

1125
01:27:45,733 --> 01:27:49,612
These are the Spanish Steps.
Completed in 1726.

1126
01:27:49,893 --> 01:27:51,929
The original Stairmaster!

1127
01:27:52,053 --> 01:27:54,965
So far we've seen the Trevi Fountain,
the Coliseum...

1128
01:27:55,053 --> 01:27:57,009
- The Spanish Steps.
...the Spanish Steps.

1129
01:27:57,133 --> 01:27:58,122
The Pantheon.

1130
01:27:58,213 --> 01:27:59,931
We're by the Trevi Fountain.

1131
01:28:01,133 --> 01:28:04,967
We're doing a scene where we're
really bummed because we were just fired.

1132
01:28:05,053 --> 01:28:07,283
And then Mr. Hammond shows up.

1133
01:28:07,853 --> 01:28:10,731
We messed up, Mr. Hammond. I'm sorry.

1134
01:28:11,213 --> 01:28:12,931
This is the Coliseum.

1135
01:28:13,053 --> 01:28:15,328
It's about 2,000 years old.

1136
01:28:16,373 --> 01:28:21,208
Gladiators would go in there and fight
against each other, or lions and tigers.

1137
01:28:21,293 --> 01:28:24,968
And this is the Coliseum,
built 2,000 years ago.

1138
01:28:25,533 --> 01:28:30,323
You know, 55 Romans...
Sorry, 55,000 Romans...

1139
01:28:30,493 --> 01:28:32,006
I made a mistake!

1140
01:28:32,093 --> 01:28:33,446
I've got to concentrate.

1141
01:28:33,613 --> 01:28:37,891
55,000 Romans. 55,000 Romans.
55,000 Romans would fill this place.

1142
01:28:38,173 --> 01:28:43,122
It's fun to work with the Italian cast
because there's a language barrier.

1143
01:28:43,213 --> 01:28:46,603
You're going back and forth
on what each other means...

1144
01:28:46,693 --> 01:28:48,411
and we mix up some words.

1145
01:28:48,973 --> 01:28:50,804
- Today is a beautiful day.
- Right.

1146
01:28:54,373 --> 01:28:55,362
Say it.

1147
01:28:59,453 --> 01:29:01,842
I've learned a lot of good words, too.
Like ciao.

1148
01:29:09,133 --> 01:29:10,771
I love you.

1149
01:29:10,893 --> 01:29:12,645
Do you love me?

1150
01:29:12,733 --> 01:29:16,282
I've been told that a lot, which means,
"Let's go!"

1151
01:29:21,533 --> 01:29:25,492
If I had to speak Italian?
I can't even say "grazie" right.

1152
01:29:26,853 --> 01:29:29,890
We got to learn some of the hand signals
that the Italians use.

1153
01:29:29,973 --> 01:29:32,965
This means "you're a liar."
Like Pinocchio, your nose is growing.

1154
01:29:33,053 --> 01:29:34,771
- What does this mean?
- "Very good."

1155
01:29:34,853 --> 01:29:36,252
It's an Italian thing.

1156
01:29:36,893 --> 01:29:39,407
She's a great dancer and a great singer.

1157
01:29:43,453 --> 01:29:47,048
The filming is a lot of fun here
because you can't understand anybody.

1158
01:29:51,653 --> 01:29:55,043
When you're trying to communicate
with the cast or the crew...

1159
01:29:55,213 --> 01:29:59,001
you know little words, so it's fun
trying to put sentences together.

1160
01:29:59,133 --> 01:30:02,125
It's fun hearing them
try to understand what you're saying...

1161
01:30:02,213 --> 01:30:04,681
and then answer to something
that you didn't say...

1162
01:30:04,773 --> 01:30:07,003
something you didn't even
come close to asking.

1163
01:30:07,173 --> 01:30:10,290
Tomorrow is a new day,
so we're not gonna worry about...

1164
01:30:11,253 --> 01:30:14,211
- Do we get to spend it together?
- Certamente.

1165
01:30:14,333 --> 01:30:17,325
The crew and the cast
has just been amazing to work with.

1166
01:30:17,413 --> 01:30:20,769
We're so lucky. Everyone is just so nice
and very accommodating.

1167
01:30:23,413 --> 01:30:24,402
Ready?

1168
01:30:24,853 --> 01:30:26,252
Smile, everybody!

1169
01:30:34,173 --> 01:30:36,482
When in Rome, eat a lot of food.

1170
01:30:36,573 --> 01:30:39,531
We've been eating
a lot of pasta, predictably.

1171
01:30:39,613 --> 01:30:41,843
- Bread.
- Bread and cheeses.

1172
01:30:42,013 --> 01:30:43,492
The pizza is very different.

1173
01:30:43,573 --> 01:30:47,202
The pizza is actually like a sandwich
with whatever in between.

1174
01:30:47,293 --> 01:30:50,285
It's not really what our pizza is
back in the U.S.

1175
01:30:50,493 --> 01:30:53,485
This is me, what I'm going to look like
when I go back to L.A.

1176
01:30:53,813 --> 01:30:55,804
- You like that?
- Love it.

1177
01:30:58,333 --> 01:31:01,086
I'm rehearsing "relaxing" right now.

1178
01:31:03,013 --> 01:31:04,526
Okay, we'll start once we...

1179
01:31:06,893 --> 01:31:08,042
And action!

1180
01:31:14,013 --> 01:31:16,083
Sir, it's just coffee.

1181
01:31:16,493 --> 01:31:17,767
In Roma...

1182
01:31:18,053 --> 01:31:19,964
coffee is a ritual.

1183
01:31:20,213 --> 01:31:23,205
- Are they really drinking coffee?
- They're drinking Coca-Cola.

1184
01:31:23,413 --> 01:31:28,612
They put the Coke in the coffee cups
because they don't want to give us coffee.

1185
01:31:28,773 --> 01:31:30,968
It's hot. It's too much to deal with.

1186
01:31:31,093 --> 01:31:32,367
Coke looks the same.

1187
01:31:34,973 --> 01:31:39,251
And if we have espresso, then we're
going to be bouncing off the walls.

1188
01:31:39,413 --> 01:31:41,608
I think that today's going to be a good day.

1189
01:31:41,693 --> 01:31:44,969
