CONDUCTOR:
River City!

73
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,062
Station stop, River City.

74
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,523
Just crossed the state line into Iowa.

75
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:00,484
Population River City: 2212.

76
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:04,280
Cigarettes illegal in this state.

77
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:08,784
If you're all through
I'll tell you about this Harold Hill.

78
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,745
Say, you know Hill?

79
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:15,124
Never saw him in my life. But I just
been run out of town because of Hill.

80
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:18,210
He's giving every one of us a black eye.

81
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,463
You go into town to call on the trade. . .

82
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,466
. . .and they're waiting for you
with tar and feathers. . .

83
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,885
. . .to ride you out the city limits on a rail!

84
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,803
How you account for that?

85
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:32,808
It's this Hill! He goes around
selling band instruments and uniforms.. .

86
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:37,313
. . .and instruction books by guaranteeing
to teach the kids to play.

87
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:40,775
- Stands to reason.
- And organize them kids into a band. . .

88
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,485
. . .with himself as the leader.

89
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,861
What's wrong with that?

90
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,322
He don't know one note. . .

91
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,324
- . . .from another!
- Heh-heh.

92
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,617
That's what's wrong!

93
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:53,204
He don't know a bass drum
from a pipe organ.

94
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:57,166
He's a bare-faced, double-shuffle,
two-bit thimblerigger!

95
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,835
And I'll catch up with him
one of these days.

96
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,171
When I do I'll have
the law on him quick!

97
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,716
Territory's tough enough
without him fouling up the nest.

98
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,177
I'd like to be around
when you catch up with him.

99
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:12,848
I'm not apt to catch up with him in Iowa.
Not on your kidney plaster!

100
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,851
He's too smart to pull
that flimflam out here.

101
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,729
Not on these neck-bowed Hawkeyes.

102
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:24,485
Gentlemen, you intrigue me.
I think I'll have to give Iowa a try.

103
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,530
- I didn't catch your name.
- I didn't drop it.

direct me to the center of town?

Friend, where would I find a good hotel?

110

00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,335
I didn't know I was, myself.

166
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:37,506
I never thought I'd find a slicker
like you here in the sarsaparilla belt.

167
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,508
This is where I work.

168
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:44,054
- You mean you live in this town?
- Yeah. I like it too.

169
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:47,891
It's not Brooklyn, New York.
Not the city of homes and churches but--

170
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,853
Brooklyn?
Marce, this isn't even Dubuque.

171
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,730
Hey. Are you hiding out or what?

172
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,569
Just not as light on my feet as I used
to be when I was shilling for you.

173
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,655
You're in a business that got
a lot of close shaves.

174
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:04,783
I got a nice job now.
I got a nice girl.

175
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,536
Ethel Toffelmier.
That's the boss's niece.

176
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,539
So you've gone legitimate, huh?

177
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,833
I knew you'd come to no good.

178
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,712
What are you selling now?
I heard you were in steam automobiles.

179
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,088
- I was.
- What happened?

180
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,049
- Somebody actually invented one.
- No!

181
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,218
So now I'm back at the old stand.

182
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,512
Not boys' bands?

183
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,348
They got no call for boys' bands
in this town.

184
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:31,310
Anything Iowa folk don't have
they do without.

185
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,686
They got music?

186
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,230
They got a gramophone down
to the barber shop.

187
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,483
And a stuck-up librarian gives piano.

188
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,193
- Gives piano?
- A maiden lady.

189
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,904
She'll expose you
before you unpack this bag.

190
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:46,200
Maiden lady librarians who give piano
are a specialty of mine.

191
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,827
Just point her out
the minute you see her.

192
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:52,080
Yeah. I'll back her into a corner
and breathe on her glasses.

193
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,543
Thar she blows!

194
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,675
I'll do it but I won't like it.

195
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,764
That's not the librarian.
That's Mrs. Shinn, the mayor's wife.

196
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,402
Good afternoon, Mrs. Shinn.

197
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,030
Don't change the subject.

198
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,782
Something the matter?

199
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:31,245
The same thing is the matter as is
always the matter here. Look!

200
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,375
Is this the sort of book
you give my daughter?

201
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:41,129
This Ruby Hat of Omar Kay-ay-ay--
I am appalled!

202
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,298
I did recommend it.

203
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,300
It's beautiful Persian poetry.

204
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,844
It's dirty Persian poetry.

205
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,806
People lying out in the woods
eating sandwiches.

206
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,268
Getting drunk
with pitfall and with gin.

207
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,813
Drinking directly out of jugs
with innocent young girls.

208
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,815
- No daughter of mine--
- Mrs. Shinn.

209
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,317
The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam
is a classic.

210
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:09,157
It's a smutty book, like most of
the others you keep here, I daresay.

211
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,492
Honestly, Mrs. Shinn.

212
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:15,122
Wouldn't you rather have your daughter
read a classic than Elinor Glyn?

213
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:20,085
What Elinor Glyn reads
is her mother's problem.

214
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:24,923
Just you keep your dirty books
away from my daughter.

215
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:47,362
You sure picked yourself a town.

216
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,823
Let me take you over to the hotel.

217
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,700
Not sure I'm going to stay yet.

218
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,996
First I got to find a way to get into
some of these Iowa boodlebags.

219
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,040
Greg, it ain't easy.

220
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,833
All I need is an opening.

221
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:03,462
You remember the pitch. What can I use?
What's new around here?

222
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:08,091
The other day a farmer brought in
an egg had 3 yolks in it.

223
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,010
Was in the paper.

224
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,388
That's exciting, all right.
No, what do you talk about?

225
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:15,891
There's the weather, of course.

226
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,726
When it's in season.

227
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,312
Now, Marce, I need some ideas. . .

228
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,940
. . .if I'm going to get your town
out of the serious trouble it's in.

229
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,901
River City ain't in any trouble.

230
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,653
We'll have to create some.

231
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:31,573
Must create a desperate need
in your town for a boys' band.

232
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,702
Why is everyone rubbering
into the billiard parlor?

233
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,039
MARCELLUS:
They just got in a new pool table.

234
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,916
HAROLD:
They must have seen one before.

235
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:43,669
No. Just billiards.

236
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:48,924
That'll do it!

237
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:50,967
Just sit where you are.
And remember. . .

238
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,261
. . .if you see that music teacher....

239
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,645
Are you Mr. Dunlop?

240
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:05,482
Either you're closing your eyes to a
situation you don't wish to acknowledge...

241
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,276
. . .or you are not aware
of the caliber of disaster...

242
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:12,280
. . .indicated by the presence of
a pool table in your community.

. . .does he rebuckle his knickerbockers

302
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,112
Is there a nicotine stain
on his index finger?

303
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,906
A dime novel hidden in the corn crib?

304
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:04,035
Is he starting to memorize jokes
from Captain Billy's Whiz Bang?

305
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:09,457
Are certain words
creeping into his conversation?

306
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,710
Words like. . . .

307
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,128
Like "swell."

308
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:16,214

Tommy Djilas did it. Tommy did it!

499
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,046
Yes, Tommy Djilas.

500
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:13,134
Tommy Djilas, I wouldn't leave
if I were you.

501
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,430
Mrs. Shinn. ..

502
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:21,642
. . .will recover.

503
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:31,152
No thanks to a certain young ruffian
who is a disgrace to our city.

504
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,655
Fourscore. . .

505
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,491
. . .and seven years ago our--

506
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:44,457
The Paine's Fireworks Spectacle,
"Last Days of Pomp-ee-eye".. .

507
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:48,294
. . .will take place at 9:30,
providing it isn't raining.

508
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:52,590
It'll be over at the Madison Picnic Park
in the far meadow.

509
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:56,469
- Across the creek from the pest house.
- What's all this talk about rain?

510
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:57,970
The Gazette predicted fair!

511
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,473
That's why we prepared for a storm.

512
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:03,058
My paper's accurate
most of the time, Jacey.

513
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,352
I wouldn't last long
in the banking business. . .

514
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:07,062
. . .being accurate most of the time.

515
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,819
Will members of the school board
stop bickering in public?

516
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,780
Never mind!

517
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,531
Fourscore--

518
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:21,869
- We heard there's a pool table in town!
- That's what I heard.

519
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:24,955
SHINN: Just a minute!
- Is it a pool table or isn't it?

520
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:27,374
Allow me to get on with the exercises.

521
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:31,504
We don't want any more exercises until
we get this pool table matter settled.

522
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,262
Let's protect our children!

523
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:43,057
We've got to protect our children!

524
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:50,564
Resist sin and corruption!

525
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,741
Let's smite that devil
and keep our young boys pure!

526
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:03,202
Pure boys!

527
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,126
Folks, listen.

528
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,629
May I have your attention, please?

529
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,256

When I hear them trombones. ...

580
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:07,251
It's them peck horns that really does it.

581
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,254
I bet you Estherville
ain't got anything like it.

582
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,172
Or even Des Moines.

583
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:17,302
I'll stake my River City band
against any town west of Chicago.

584
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,514
What band?

585
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:25,310
Honestly! A bunch of grown men.

586
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:32,651
Along comes this fly-by-night salesman
and you're all taken in.

587
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:39,700
She's right.
The man's a by-God spellbinder!

588
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:43,912
I haven't seen people so excited since
Frank Gotch and Strangler Lewis. ..

589
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:47,374
. . .lay on the mat for three and a half hours
without moving a muscle.

590
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:50,294
Oh, but that was exciting!

591
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,586
Never mind!

592
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,839
Men, this calls for emergency action.

593
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,258
I want that man's credentials.

594
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:01,763
Grab that hoodlum!
He almost blew up Mrs. Shinn.

595
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:03,682
Great honk! Let me go!

596
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,601
Much obliged.
Have to make an example of this one.

597
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:09,187
Everything the ringleader does
the gang does.

598
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:10,689
You wild kid, you!

599
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,399
Hanging around my oldest girl.

600
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,152
His father is one of them Nithelanians.

601
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,529
- You wild kid, you!
- What'd I do?

602
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:21,241
- Tagging after my oldest girl.
- I wasn't either tagging.

603
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:22,534
Don't contradict me!

604
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:25,537
We was just walking together.
Great honk!

605
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:29,374
Watch your phraseology. I know what
you was doing. Little Gracie seen you.

606
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:32,961
Stay away from my oldest or you'll hear
from me till who-laid-the-rails.

607
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:37,299
I'll talk to you Monday morning about
this band thing. Here in City Hall.

608
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,426
Ten o'clock sharp.

609
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,430
Now, constable!

610
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,015
I'll be responsible for him.

611
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:48,977
This kid's tough. Probably got
his gang waiting around the corner.

612
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:50,979
I'll be careful.

613
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:53,774
Tommy, I want to talk to you
about the band.

614
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:56,443
Gee, professor,
that's for the little kids.

615
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,987
No, not about playing in the band.

616
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:00,864
Aren't you mechanically minded?

617
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:03,325
Did you ever do anything with. . .

618
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,077
. . .perpetual motion?

619
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:06,953
Yeah. I nearly had it
a couple times.

620
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:09,831
You did? Well, you're my man.

621
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:12,793
Do you realize no one has ever
invented a music holder...

622
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,462
. . .for a marching piccolo player?

623
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,840
There's no place to hang the music.

624
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:22,094
Great honk! Where can I get wire?

625
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:24,638
Look in your cellar.
That's where people keep wire.

626
00:45:24,806 --> 00:45:26,139
Oh, Tommy.

627
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:27,432
Yes, sir?

628
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,643
Constable, I'll show you
how to break up a gang.

629
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:31,269
Young lady!

630
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:32,979
Miss, what's your name?

631
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:34,648
Zaneeta.

632
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:38,652
I didn't have any idea you was
beckoning to me. Ye gods!

633
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,654
- Do you know Tommy Djilas?
- Well--

634
00:45:40,822 --> 00:45:44,032
Now, Tommy, this is Zaneeta.
Escort the young lady home.

635
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:47,327
Only I'm not going home.
I have to go to the library.

636
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:48,537
Ye gods!

637
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:53,792
Then escort the young lady home
by way of the library, uh-huh. . .

638
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,170
. . .by way of the Candy Kitchen.

639
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,005
Yes, sir.

640
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,590
Do I have to?

641
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,134
Oh, you have to.

642
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:03,427
Yes, sir!

643
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:05,011
Ye gods!

644
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,013
Professor.

645
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:10,183
You're a bright young fella,
only you made a couple mistakes.

646
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:12,853
- Oh?
- The mayor owns that billiard parlor. . .

647
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,604
. . .and that new pool table.

648
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:17,816
You don't say?
What was my other mistake?

649
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,401
That Zaneeta.

650
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,571
She's the mayor's oldest girl.

651
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,519
Good evening, ladies.

652
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,318
Just a minute, Professor Hill.

653
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:04,779
Sorry, we're the school board
and we need your credentials.

654
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:07,449
- Academic certificates.
- Nothing of the kind!

655
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,284
We need letters and papers.

656
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,328
Make him put up a bond.

657
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,038
What am I hearing?

658
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,456
You, sir.

659
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,710
Say "ice cream"

660
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:22,088
- Ice cream. But I don't sing--
- Talk, then.

661
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,423
HAROLD:
Down here

662
00:47:23,633 --> 00:47:25,550
Ice cream

663
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:27,928
Ice cream.

664
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,138
Talk slow

665
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:32,974
Ice cream

666
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:34,935
You see? Singing is just. . . .

667
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,103
Sustained talking

668
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,313
Now you, sir.

669
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:39,523
Ice cream

670
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,317
Now you, sir.
Now you, sir!

671
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:47,948
Ice cream

672
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:53,453
From now on you won't see one of
those men without the other three.

673
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:55,038
Professor, you're wrong.

674
00:47:55,248 --> 00:47:58,750
Why, they've hated each other
for 15 years.

675

Oh, please, please!

694
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:20,934
Professor Hill.

695
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,937
Professor? Of what?

696
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:26,981
What college gives a degree
for accosting women. . .

697
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:29,275
. . .like a rowdy at a public dance hall?

698
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:32,028
I wouldn't know.
I'm a Conservatory man.

699
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:34,489
Gary, Indiana.
Gold Medal class of '05.

700
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:37,951
Even should that happen
to be true, Mr. Hill...

701
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:41,287
. . . I am not as easily mesmerized
as some people in town.

702
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:44,708
It's only fair to tell you
I'm not impressed by your credentials. . .

703
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:48,169
. . .which I've not seen,
nor your manners, which I have!

704
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,722
HAROLD:
It's a golden key, as it were.

705
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:01,599
Your key to the magic world of music.

706
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:04,686
None of our family's ever been
what you'd call musical.

707
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,564
Madam, that you do not know.

708
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:12,819
Now the main thing is imagination
and proper instruction. Ah!

709
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:15,655
You, young man, repeat after me.

710
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:20,076
♪ I love music, Mommy ♪

711
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,454

712
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,664

00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:30,128

00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:32,297
Madam, it's amazing!

716
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,425
Two members of the same family
with absolutely perfect pitch.

717
00:51:38,888 --> 00:51:40,680
Sign here, madam.

718
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,730
MARCELLUS: You sure cut a swath down
at the high school yesterday.

719
00:51:48,898 --> 00:51:51,983
- Yeah.
- When you talked about them trombones. . .

720
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:54,152
. . .you looked just like you used to
back in Joplin.

721
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,279
HAROLD:
Joplin?

722
00:51:56,447 --> 00:52:00,867
Yeah, when you used to imitate that
Italian bandleader in the park.

723
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:03,036
Oh, yeah.

724
00:52:04,497 --> 00:52:09,417
Ra ta ta ta ta ta
Ram ta ra ta ram

725
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:13,671
That's kid stuff.

726
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,216
I'm in rare form these days, son.

727
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:19,302
Just keep your eye on me
for the next four weeks.

728
00:52:19,512 --> 00:52:22,847
Four weeks? You used to get
the instruments in 10 days.

729
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:26,643
I still do, but it takes
four weeks for the uniforms.

730
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:29,562
Uniforms? You've added uniforms?

731
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:32,524
Uniforms and instruction books.

732
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:35,193
Why warm up if
you're not going to pitch?

733
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:39,739
You can't pass yourself off as
a music professor. You can't read music.

734
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:43,034
I have a revolutionary new method,
the Think System.

735
00:52:43,202 --> 00:52:44,661
You don't bother with notes.

736
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:45,912
My boy...

737
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:50,041
. . .someday reading music is
going to be absolutely obsolete.

738
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:53,962
I hope it's soon. In four weeks
these people will want to hear music.

739
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:57,257
But when the uniforms arrive
they forget everything else.

740
00:52:57,466 --> 00:53:00,301
At least long enough for me
to collect and leave.

741
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:02,679
This is a refined operation, son.

742
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:06,015
I've got it timed down to
the wave of the brakeman's hand. . .

743
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:08,726
. . .on the last train out of town.

744
00:53:21,574 --> 00:53:23,908
- Good evening, ladies.
- Good evening, ladies.

745
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,291
HAROLD: Good evening, ladies.
WOMEN: Oh.

746
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,625
Professor Hill.. .

747
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:34,252
. . .we're all agog.

748
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:37,297
Oh, yes, simply agog!

749
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:40,216
- On the qui vive.
- Everyone's excited about the band.

750
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:43,177
I'm Ethel Toffelmier,
the pianola girl.

751
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:44,971
And this is Avis Grubb.

752
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:46,890
- How do you do?
- And Mrs. Hicks.

753
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,517
- Hello.
- And Mrs. Squires.

754
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:53,146
And, of course, you've met
Eulalie Mackecknie Shinn.

755
00:53:53,314 --> 00:53:55,815
- Our mayor's wife.
- Yes, indeed.

756
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:57,984
Oh, yes.

757
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:01,446
Isn't it exciting, Eulalie?

758
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,781
I couldn't say.

759
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,825
Oh, no, I could not say.

760
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:08,494
I could not say at this time.

761
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:11,331
My husband will wish to investigate,
I'm sure.

762
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:13,791
And naturally I'm reticent.

763
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,794
Oh, yes. I'm reticent.

764
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:19,756
Yes, of course.
I understand, Mrs. Shinn.

765
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:23,301
But part of my music plans
include a committee on the dance.

766
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:24,928
And I was thinking--

767
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:29,974
Do that again, Mrs. Shinn.

768
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,477
Do what? What did I do?

769
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,604
Your foot, the way you just raised it.

770
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:38,191
Oh, well, I have a bunion there
that bothers me.

771
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:39,901
What grace!

772
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,820
Oh, Mr. Hill.

773
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,822
What natural flow of rhythm!

774
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,449
Oh, Mr. Hill.

775
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:48,952
What expression of line and movement!

776
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:52,705
You must accept chairmanship. . .

777
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:56,626
. . .of the ladies' auxiliary for the
classic dance. Mustn't she, ladies?

778
00:54:58,504 --> 00:55:02,715
Mrs. Shinn, your every move
bespeaks Delsarte.

779
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,009
Will you? Will you?

780
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:06,469
Say yes, Mrs. Shinn.

781
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:07,845
Well, I--

782
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:09,722
That is--

783
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:12,558
Dancing? Well!

784
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:13,768
Then you accept?

785
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:15,478
Indeed! And I'd like to say--

786
00:55:15,688 --> 00:55:17,814
Thank you, Mrs. Shinn.

787
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:19,148
Oh. . . .

788
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,656
Now, the young lady
who teaches the piano.

789
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:30,118
Marian Paroo, I believe.

790
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:31,744
ALL:
Oh!

791
00:55:33,956 --> 00:55:35,581
After all, she is the librarian.

792
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,542
She must've picked him out
the first crack out of the box.

793
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:38,751
Talking up to a man like that.

794
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:41,754
He wouldn't talk about her if she
didn't try turkey-talking to him.

795
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,923
Ought to take her ticket
and punch it for her.

796
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:45,550
Picked her out first crack
like a cheap jack.

797
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:46,968
Not much pick to her.

00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,678
- Pick a little, talk a lot.
- Pick a little, talk a little.

799

Of course, I shouldn't tell you this,

- Chaucer.

- Let me tell.
- No, I'll tell.

817
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:29,177
She made brazen overtures to a man
who never had a friend. . .

818
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:30,636
. . .till she came here.

819

I should say!

The showoff!

825
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:46,694
He gave the town the library too.

826
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:50,156
That's just it. When he died
he left the library to the city.

But he left all the books to her.

828
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:55,828

1012
01:10:24,304 --> 01:10:26,054
It means your son's little finger...

1013
01:10:26,264 --> 01:10:29,474
. . .is perfectly situated for
the spit valve on a flügelhorn.

1014
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,060
- Is that good?
- Good?

1015
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:34,688
It means America finally has
an artist who can. . .

1016
01:10:34,898 --> 01:10:36,899
. . .flügel the "Minute Waltz"
in 50 seconds.

1017
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:39,651
- How can I get one of those horns?
- Sign here.

1018
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:41,111
Yes, sir.

1019
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:42,821
Fine, fine!

1020
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:44,823
That'll be 17 dollars import fee.

1021
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:47,492
Just think, I could've
missed this whole thing.

1022
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,494
My son could've--

1023
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:53,832
I haven't got any son!

1024
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,667
Oh, George.

1025
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:57,961
I never had a son.

1026
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,172
- I never said you did.
- What do you know?

1027
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:03,258
I'd certainly know if I gave you a son.

1028
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:06,011
- I'm not talking to you.
- Who are you talking to?

1029
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:07,471
- Him.
- Who?

1030
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:11,934
Never mind!

1031
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:16,021
Zaneeta, call Dr. Pyne for your father.

1032
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:22,277
HAROLD: Yes, my dear Mrs. Paroo,
you must realize. . .

1033
01:11:22,487 --> 01:11:25,030
. . .that only one
out of every 78 adults.. .

1034
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:28,742
. . .has a ganglion that reaches
the ligature clear down to the apex.

1035
01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:32,871
This automatically turns your
entire face into an amazing embouchure.

1036
01:11:33,456 --> 01:11:35,624
I never had a sick day
in my life, doctor.

1037
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:37,709
Ah. Professor.

1038
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:40,837
Professor! What shall I do for it?

1039
01:11:41,172 --> 01:11:42,547
No, you don't understand.

1040
01:11:42,757 --> 01:11:45,968
I'm trying to tell you,
you have the facial characteristics. . .

1041
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:48,220
. . .of a cornet virtuoso.

1042
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:50,764
If your boy has that same firm chin...

1043
01:11:50,974 --> 01:11:53,225
. . .and those splendid cheek muscles,
oh-ho-ho. . ..

1044
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:55,018
By George!

1045
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,688
Not that he'd ever really be great.

1046
01:11:58,022 --> 01:11:59,481
Is that so?

1047
01:11:59,691 --> 01:12:01,900
And in the name of
St. Bridget, why not?

1048
01:12:02,193 --> 01:12:05,362
All of the really great
cornet players were Irish.

1049
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:07,990
O'Clark, O'Mendez, O'Klein.. . .

1050
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:10,367
But, professor, we are Irish.

1051
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,077
No!

1052
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:13,912
No, really? That clinches it.

1053
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:17,666
Sign here, Madam.
Your boy was born to play the cornet.

1054
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:22,087
Fine, fine!
That'll be 7 dollars earnest money.

1055
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:25,924
Nothing more due until
the opening of band practice.

1056
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:30,095
Thank you. And I'll need your boy's
measurements for his uniform.

1057
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:31,680
MRS. PAROO:
His uniform?

1058
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:33,056
- Oh, yes--
- Ah!

1059
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:36,643
- Winthrop!
- Well, hello there, son.

1060
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:39,563
Why, certainly, his uniform.

1061
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:42,482
And there won't be
a penny due until delivery.

1062
01:12:42,692 --> 01:12:46,987
Which gives him four weeks to enjoy,
anticipate, imagine at no cost.

1063
01:12:47,155 --> 01:12:48,947
Never allow the demands of tomorrow. . .

1064
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:52,492
. . .to interfere with the pleasures
and excitements of today.

1065
01:12:52,744 --> 01:12:54,119
Would it have a--?

1066
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:56,371
- A. . . .
- A. . . .

1067
01:12:58,458 --> 01:13:00,751
A stripe! Why, certainly, my boy!

1068
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,629
A wide, red stripe down each side.
What do you think of that?

1069
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:13,680
You'll have to excuse Winthrop.

1070
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:16,475
We can't get him to say
three words a day.

1071
01:13:16,684 --> 01:13:18,185
Not even to us.

1072
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:20,771
If you can get him to play
in that band. . .

1073
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:23,482
. . .you'll have St. Michael's
own way with you.

1074
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:26,651
But if anybody can do it,
I bet you can. Heh-heh.

1075
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:27,819
Thank you.

1076
01:13:27,987 --> 01:13:31,782
You've a gift of the blarney about you,
no mistaking that.

1077
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:34,326
- Where are you from, my boy?
- Gary, Indiana.

1078
01:13:34,494 --> 01:13:35,535
I knew it!

1079
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:37,162
Where'd you say?

1080
01:13:37,455 --> 01:13:40,791
Gary, Indiana.
Gary Conservatory was my alma mater.

1081
01:13:41,084 --> 01:13:42,125
Was she now?

1082
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:45,629
Yes, indeed.

Mama!

1108
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:40,785
How do you do, Miss Paroo?

1109
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:42,746
How do you do?

1110
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:46,666
Of course, Paroo!
I thought the name sounded familiar.

1111
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:50,712
- I've been trying to see you.
- He wants to put Winthrop in the band.

1112
01:15:50,922 --> 01:15:52,130
MARIAN:
We're not interested.

1113
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:56,009
But Marian dear, the boy might have
his father's musical gift.

1114
01:15:56,219 --> 01:15:58,220
He does have my ganglion, you know.

1115
01:15:58,638 --> 01:16:01,431
Your husband is musical?
I'd like to talk to him.

1116
01:16:01,849 --> 01:16:05,477
Do you always burst into people's homes
prying into personal affairs?

1117
01:16:05,645 --> 01:16:07,229
We're not interested.

1118
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:08,521
Marian!

1119
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:10,357
There's one for and one against.

1120
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:13,235
Now, why not let
the boy's father decide?

1121
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:15,987
The boy's father is dead.

1122
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:19,616
Anything else?

1123
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:21,660
I am sorry.

1124
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:24,496
But all the more reason
he should have this!

1125
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:29,000
My brother is an unhappy child who can't
understand why his father was taken away.

1126
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:33,213
Would you care to explain it to him?
He's been brooding for two years.

1127
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:37,717
And as for your musical tricks,
go into business with a carnival man.. .

1128
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:40,679
. . .who sells painted watches
and glass diamond rings!

1129
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:43,640
HAROLD:
Musical tricks? Now, Miss Paroo!

1130
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:50,355
I have a feeling she likes the idea.

1131
01:16:50,523 --> 01:16:53,358
A little cautious,
but I admire that in a woman.

1132
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:55,777
I'll be back later in the week.

1133
01:16:56,112 --> 01:16:59,364
I do hope you'll excuse Marian.
She's not really--

1134
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:02,534
Please, don't you worry about a thing.

1135
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:07,247
I'm sure that at heart,
she's as lovely as yourself.

1136
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:11,042
Good day to you, Widow Paroo.

1137
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:38,069
- Has he gone?
- He has. And I hope not forever.

1138
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:40,739
Darling, don't you ever think
of your future?

1139
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:44,409
Now, Mama, a girl's future
doesn't depend on encouraging. . .

1140
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:46,703
. . .every fast-talking,
self-centered...

1141
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:49,080
. . .woman-chasing traveling man
who comes to town.

1142
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:50,999
All right, darling. All right.

1143
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:54,669
Only it's a well-known principle that
if you keep the flint in one drawer. . .

1144
01:17:54,837 --> 01:17:57,547
. . .and the steel in the other
you'll never strike a fire.

1145
01:17:57,715 --> 01:18:00,091
- Mama!
- A fine-looking man.

1146
01:18:00,301 --> 01:18:01,426
And educated.

1147
01:18:01,594 --> 01:18:05,180
Gary, Indiana Conservation
class of 'Aught-five.

1148
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:09,976
That he claims his commodity is music
does not, in this case, impress me.

1149
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:12,145
Nor does anything else about him.

1150
01:18:12,355 --> 01:18:13,730
I give up.

1151
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:17,942
At your age, if you don't mind my asking,
what are you waiting for?

1152
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:21,279
Not for Ed Griner, who backs me
into the history shelf. . .

1153
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:23,114
. . .every time he's in the library.

1154
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:24,574
He does?

1155
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:28,620
Or Ed Gammage who has the buggy
with the removable back seat.

1156
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:33,249
If you're waiting for a knight in shining
white armor to come riding up the street. . ..

1157
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,919
I'm not waiting for that either.

1158
01:18:36,128 --> 01:18:38,213
Then what are you waiting for?

1159
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:41,883
Marian Paroo,
if you don't mind my asking...

1160
01:18:42,093 --> 01:18:44,803
. . .don't you ever think
about being in love?

1161
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:46,471

01:30:54,199 --> 01:30:55,491
Trial and error!

1348
01:30:56,493 --> 01:30:59,203
- Could you show me, professor?
- Oh.

1349
01:31:00,831 --> 01:31:03,499
I'll tell you what
the great Giuseppe Creatore. . .

1350
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:06,001
. . .said to me once
under like circumstances.

1351
01:31:06,253 --> 01:31:10,005
"Professor Hill," he said,
"that is your instrument.

1352
01:31:10,215 --> 01:31:11,465
Hold onto it.

1353
01:31:11,675 --> 01:31:13,050
Cherish it.

1354
01:31:13,218 --> 01:31:15,761
Don't let anybody else play it.
Not even me.

1355
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:17,555
Not even you.

1356
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:20,724
Until you feel you're ready."

1357
01:31:20,892 --> 01:31:23,269
- But--
- Ah-ah-ah-ah.

1358
01:31:23,436 --> 01:31:24,937
Yes, sir.

1359
01:31:25,522 --> 01:31:26,564
All together now.

1360
01:31:27,107 --> 01:31:28,983
Over and over.

1361
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:34,405
La di da di da
Di da di da

1362
01:31:34,573 --> 01:31:38,159
La di da
La di da

1363
01:31:38,326 --> 01:31:39,368
Tommy.

1364
01:31:39,536 --> 01:31:41,912
La di da di da
Di da

1365
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:43,080
Take charge.

1366
01:31:43,248 --> 01:31:46,542
Another half-hour at least
on the minuet.

1367
01:32:11,610 --> 01:32:14,612
- Strawberry phosphate, please.
- Right with you.

1368
01:32:23,872 --> 01:32:25,247
Ye gods!

1369
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,417
Great honk!

1370
01:32:30,128 --> 01:32:33,881
If there's anything you
don't see there, ask for it.

1371
01:32:42,599 --> 01:32:45,309
Oh. Professor Hill, I didn't see you.

1372
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:46,602
May I join you?

1373
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:48,270
Well, really, I--

1374
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:51,732
Where? They were seen!
Red-handed! Caught in the act!

1375
01:32:51,942 --> 01:32:54,777
- Take your hands off my daughter!
- Papa!

1376
01:32:54,945 --> 01:32:58,781
Mr. Shinn, Your Honor, your daughter
and I are going steady behind your back.

1377
01:32:58,949 --> 01:33:02,159
- Why, you--!
- We'd rather do it in front of your back.

1378
01:33:02,327 --> 01:33:03,369
Do what?

1379
01:33:03,536 --> 01:33:05,329
- Well, uh--
- Never mind!

1380
01:33:05,538 --> 01:33:07,331
Zaneeta's scared of you but I'm not.

1381
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:11,043
I should think you'd hate to have your
daughter scared of you. Great honk!

1382
01:33:11,253 --> 01:33:14,129
I'll warn you once more:
If you ever touch my daughter. . .

1383
01:33:14,339 --> 01:33:16,674
. . . I'll horsewhip you
till hell won't have it!

1384
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:17,883
Now, George!

1385
01:33:18,051 --> 01:33:20,636
Not one poop out of you, Madam.

1386
01:33:20,845 --> 01:33:22,263
I think he means "peep."

1387
01:33:24,933 --> 01:33:26,016
Yeah.

1388
01:33:28,728 --> 01:33:31,146
Now get out of this public emporium!

1389
01:33:31,523 --> 01:33:34,483
I got as much right in
a public emporium as anybody!

1390
01:33:34,693 --> 01:33:36,735
How do you get any right around here?

1391
01:33:36,945 --> 01:33:40,364
Aiding and abetting the swindling
activities of this cymbal salesman!

1392
01:33:40,573 --> 01:33:43,492
You know what I see written
all over you? Reform school!

1393
01:33:43,702 --> 01:33:44,910
Now get out!

1394
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:46,537
Get out, you wild kid!

1395
01:33:46,705 --> 01:33:48,122
Papa, please!

1396
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:53,127
It's Capulets like you make blood
in the marketplace. Ye gods!

1397
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:56,588
You watch your phraseology,
young woman!

1398
01:33:56,798 --> 01:33:58,215
Go home.

1399
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:04,471
Taking up with wild kids
from the wrong side of town!

1400
01:34:04,681 --> 01:34:06,223
If I could make you understand--

1401
01:34:06,433 --> 01:34:08,225
Well, you can't!

1402
01:34:08,852 --> 01:34:10,561
And thanks for the buggy ride.

1403
01:34:10,729 --> 01:34:13,731
I read that book you gave me
from cover to cover...

1404
01:34:13,898 --> 01:34:15,316
. . .and didn't find a thing.

1405
01:34:15,525 --> 01:34:16,567
Mr. Mayor, please--

1406
01:34:16,735 --> 01:34:17,943
I'll settle your hash.. .

1407
01:34:18,111 --> 01:34:20,946
. . .as soon as I get these premises
off my oldest girl.

1408
01:34:22,615 --> 01:34:24,283
- Yes.
- But in the meantime. . .

1409
01:34:24,451 --> 01:34:26,618
. . . I'm vouching for Tommy Djilas.

1410
01:34:26,828 --> 01:34:29,330
He has the confidence
of every kid in town.

1411
01:34:29,539 --> 01:34:31,707
You'll be waiting to shake his hand. . .

1412
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:33,917
. . .when our band
plays its first concert.

1413
01:34:34,127 --> 01:34:36,545
By that time,
my fine young feathered. ..

1414
01:34:36,755 --> 01:34:39,048
. . .my feathered young,
my feathered fine--

1415
01:34:39,257 --> 01:34:40,841
Never mind!

1416
01:34:45,847 --> 01:34:47,931
Oliver! Jacey! Ewart! Olin!

1417
01:34:48,099 --> 01:34:50,976
I want that man's references
and I want them tonight.

1418
01:34:51,186 --> 01:34:54,563
He's slipperier than
a Mississippi...sturgeon.

1419
01:34:55,523 --> 01:34:57,941
I think Mayor Shinn behaved abominably.

1420
01:34:58,151 --> 01:35:01,278
And it was wonderful of you,
sticking up for Tommy Djilas.

1421
01:35:01,446 --> 01:35:04,198
- Oh, that was nothing.
- Yes, it was.

1422
01:35:04,574 --> 01:35:09,119
A man can't go back on his principles
because personal risk is involved.

1423
01:35:09,329 --> 01:35:10,913
What does the poet say?

1424
01:35:11,122 --> 01:35:15,125
A coward dies 1000 deaths.
A brave man.. .

1425
01:35:15,293 --> 01:35:17,127
. . .only 500.

1426
01:35:17,295 --> 01:35:18,962
- Something like that.
- Thank you.

1427
01:35:19,381 --> 01:35:21,340
Get his papers or get him in jail!

1428
01:35:21,549 --> 01:35:23,342
I couldn't make myself clearer. . .

1429
01:35:23,551 --> 01:35:25,636
. . .if I was a buttonhook
in well water.

1430
01:35:30,475 --> 01:35:33,143
I want to talk to you
about Winthrop's cornet.

1431
01:35:33,311 --> 01:35:37,272
A beautiful instrument.
Hammered brass, mother-of-pearl keys.

1432
01:35:37,482 --> 01:35:41,026
But he never touches it. He said
you told him it wasn't necessary.

1433
01:35:41,986 --> 01:35:43,153
You must understand--

1434
01:35:43,363 --> 01:35:46,115
Something about a "Think System."

1435
01:35:46,324 --> 01:35:49,660
He says if he thinks the "Minuet in G"
he can play it.

1436
01:35:49,869 --> 01:35:52,996
I admit it's still
in the experimental stages.

1437
01:35:53,206 --> 01:35:56,875
To a seasoned professional like yourself
it may seem ludicrous.

1438
01:35:57,293 --> 01:35:59,294
You mustn't say that.

1439
01:36:01,214 --> 01:36:02,840
- I mustn't?
- No.

1440
01:36:03,258 --> 01:36:06,844
Throughout history the true
originator is always laughed at.

1441
01:36:07,053 --> 01:36:10,556
I hope you don't class me with
those small minds who ridiculed--

1442
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:13,559
- Galileo.
- Yes, and his conception of the heavens.

1443
01:36:13,768 --> 01:36:15,144
Or Fulton.

1444
01:36:15,353 --> 01:36:18,605
- Yes. Or Columbus.
- And his conception of the egg--

1445
01:36:18,815 --> 01:36:20,274
Globe!

1446
01:36:21,443 --> 01:36:24,194
The one thing one must remember,
no matter who one is. . .

1447
01:36:24,362 --> 01:36:25,821
. . .or what one is working for. . .

1448
01:36:25,989 --> 01:36:29,199
. . .one can do anything
if one puts one's mind to it.

1449
01:36:30,201 --> 01:36:31,493
Miss Marian...

1450
01:36:31,703 --> 01:36:36,039
. . .if one could only tell you
how much you've done for one.

1451
01:36:37,876 --> 01:36:41,170
I would deem it a great privilege
to talk with you again.

1452
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:43,797
Well, all I said--

1453
01:36:43,965 --> 01:36:46,508
May one call upon you some evening?

1454
01:36:49,554 --> 01:36:51,680
Any night this week.

1455
01:37:15,205 --> 01:37:16,497
Good evening, gentlemen.

1456
01:37:19,459 --> 01:37:21,585
Sorry, professor,
but we got our orders.

1457
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:23,504
We all been deputized.

1458
01:37:23,713 --> 01:37:25,422
Yes, yes, yes.

1459
01:37:25,632 --> 01:37:27,508
Congratulations. Now let me see.

1460
01:37:27,717 --> 01:37:30,260
Every time I try to give you
those credentials. . .

1461
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:32,846
. . .you always try to
change the subject somehow.

1462
01:37:33,056 --> 01:37:36,558
It's like a conspiracy.
I'll go up in my room and get them.

1463
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:40,604
- Sorry! Afraid I'll have to go with you.
- Oh, yes.

1464
01:37:41,231 --> 01:37:43,232
Let's see if I have my key.

1465
01:37:43,858 --> 01:37:45,275
What's this?

1466
01:37:48,321 --> 01:37:49,863
HAROLD:
What do you know?

1467
01:37:51,449 --> 01:37:53,909
A testimonial from
the only female bassoonist. . .

1468
01:37:54,118 --> 01:37:56,328
. . .on the Redpath Circuit.
Madame Rini.

1469
01:37:56,538 --> 01:37:59,456
That's her stage name.
Actually she's from Moline.

1470
01:37:59,624 --> 01:38:01,625
- Lida Rose Quackenbush.
- Can I see that?

1471
01:38:01,793 --> 01:38:03,752
You never forget the name.
Lida Rose.

1472
01:38:03,962 --> 01:38:06,421

Will you ever stop arguing
with yourself?

1539
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:34,231
Will you ever tell him?
Won't you ever tell him? Yes! No!

1540
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:37,359
Fiddlesticks! Open your mouth
and let it come out.

1541
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:38,944
- Now, Mama--
- Now, nothing.

1542
01:42:39,153 --> 01:42:41,696
If he ever calls again,
you see him alone...

1543
01:42:41,989 --> 01:42:44,741
. . .and if you haven't the gumption
to tell him how you feel--

1544
01:42:44,909 --> 01:42:48,745
MARIAN: Tell him?
- Nothing wrong with a ladylike hint.

1545
01:42:49,163 --> 01:42:51,414
Ah! What's that thing you got?

1546
01:42:51,624 --> 01:42:55,168
It's a genuine Hercules
combination pocketknife and tool kit. . .

1547
01:42:55,378 --> 01:42:58,588
. . .with a solid stag handle
and six sturdy steel blades.

1548
01:42:58,756 --> 01:43:00,715
Blessed Martin of Tours!

1549
01:43:01,092 --> 01:43:04,469
One spear blade, one sheep's foot blade,
one small pen blade. . .

1550
01:43:04,679 --> 01:43:08,890
. . .a swagging awl, a file and
a combination tack puller and screwdriver.

1551
01:43:09,183 --> 01:43:11,476
Where'd you pick up
that horrible weapon?

1552
01:43:11,686 --> 01:43:13,144
It was a present.

1553
01:43:13,354 --> 01:43:14,396
From Harold.

1554
01:43:14,605 --> 01:43:16,690
- Professor Hill?
- Uh-huh.

1555
01:43:16,858 --> 01:43:19,025
He says if I stick around River City. . .

1556
01:43:19,235 --> 01:43:21,194
. . . I better learn to whittle and spit.

1557
01:43:21,404 --> 01:43:23,405
I got the spitting down pretty good.

1558
01:43:23,948 --> 01:43:28,243
Winthrop, what do you and Harold
find to talk about?

1559
01:43:28,619 --> 01:43:32,455
Sometimes we talk business
and sometimes just plain talk.

1560
01:43:32,623 --> 01:43:35,083
He talks about his hometown,
Gary, Indiana.

1561
01:43:35,293 --> 01:43:37,294
He said he'd take me there someday.

1562
01:43:37,670 --> 01:43:39,379
Isn't that nice?

1563
01:43:39,797 --> 01:43:43,300

1580
01:44:45,446 --> 01:44:47,530
You still have to change
for the sociable.

1581
01:45:01,963 --> 01:45:04,589
Do the Shinns live
around here somewhere?

1582
01:45:05,508 --> 01:45:07,634
The Shinn home is on East Elm.
This is West Elm.

1583
01:45:07,802 --> 01:45:10,053
Mm, criminy.

1584
01:45:11,472 --> 01:45:13,556
Oh. I see you're the
piano teacher here in town.

1585
01:45:14,892 --> 01:45:18,103
You must know about this fellow Hill
forming a boys' band here.

1586
01:45:18,312 --> 01:45:23,066
Don't let that worry you no more.
I got the goods on him in spades.

1587
01:45:23,275 --> 01:45:25,735
That swindling, two-bit
thimblerigger!

1588
01:45:25,903 --> 01:45:28,405
That's why I got to see Shinn.
I'm just passing through. . .

1589
01:45:28,572 --> 01:45:31,491
. . .and number 8 only makes
a 15-minute water stop and--

1590
01:45:33,077 --> 01:45:34,744
Ooh.

1591
01:45:35,246 --> 01:45:37,163
I wish it was 20.

1592
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:42,419
Sure could concentrate five minutes
on you, girlie-girl.

1593
01:45:43,045 --> 01:45:44,087
Who are you?

1594
01:45:44,588 --> 01:45:47,507
Name's Charlie Cowell.
Anvil salesman.

1595
01:45:50,344 --> 01:45:52,762
But now I've got heavier things
on my mind.

1596
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:57,726
I've got to protect the good name
of the traveling fraternity from Hill.

1597
01:45:58,519 --> 01:46:01,730
Mr. Cowell,
you're making a big mistake.

1598
01:46:01,939 --> 01:46:04,607
Mistake, my old lady's corset cover!

1599
01:46:04,817 --> 01:46:06,609
He's been the raspberry seed. . .

1600
01:46:06,819 --> 01:46:09,946
. . .in my wisdom tooth just long enough.

1601
01:46:10,114 --> 01:46:12,699
He spoiled lllinois for me.
But he won't spoil Iowa.

1602
01:46:13,075 --> 01:46:15,660
You're a music teacher.
You didn't see through him?

1603
01:46:15,870 --> 01:46:18,538
- He's no more professor--
- I know all about that.

1604
01:46:18,748 --> 01:46:21,207
Bandleaders are always called professor.

1605
01:46:21,417 --> 01:46:24,669
It's an academic courtesy.
He's a fine director--

1606
01:46:24,879 --> 01:46:28,131
Now wait a minute!

1607
01:46:28,299 --> 01:46:29,758
Fine director?

1608
01:46:29,967 --> 01:46:32,594
Tell me, you heard one note
of music from any band?

1609
01:46:33,637 --> 01:46:35,638
Well, no, but--

1610
01:46:35,806 --> 01:46:40,143
But nothing, girlie-girl.
He never formed a band in his life.

1611
01:46:40,311 --> 01:46:42,312
And you think he ever will?

1612
01:46:42,521 --> 01:46:44,355
Not on your previous existence!

1613
01:46:44,565 --> 01:46:45,940
Just listen a minute--

1614
01:46:46,150 --> 01:46:47,776
I'd like to.

1615
01:46:50,154 --> 01:46:53,114
I'd like to do more than that
if I had the time.

1616
01:46:53,657 --> 01:46:55,366
Sure got the inclination.

1617
01:46:57,078 --> 01:47:01,456
But I got to leave this dynamite
with somebody on the way to the depot.

1618
01:47:02,374 --> 01:47:05,502
Bye, girlie-girl. I'll see you
next time I come through.

1619
01:47:07,671 --> 01:47:11,132
You'll never make that train
at the depot. Catch it at the crossing.

1620
01:47:11,342 --> 01:47:16,179
I've got to leave word, and I can see
you ain't the one to leave it with.

1621
01:47:16,347 --> 01:47:17,847
Wait a minute!

1622
01:47:18,015 --> 01:47:19,474
Mr. Cowell.

1623
01:47:25,106 --> 01:47:28,024
You don't know me very well yet.

1624
01:47:30,361 --> 01:47:33,571
Is that an invitation, girlie-girl?

1625
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:37,200
No. I mean, I don't know you.

1626
01:47:37,368 --> 01:47:39,702
I'd need more time anyway.

1627
01:47:39,912 --> 01:47:41,955
What I mean is. . .

1628
01:47:42,164 --> 01:47:45,708
. . .as well as I'd like to.

1629
01:47:47,378 --> 01:47:50,171
Oh. There's no trouble there. ..

1630
01:47:50,381 --> 01:47:52,090
. . .girlie-girl!

1631
01:47:53,759 --> 01:47:56,219
I've never met a man. ..

1632
01:47:56,387 --> 01:47:58,513
. . .who sells anvils before.

1633
01:47:59,557 --> 01:48:01,391
It's really quite. . .

1634
01:48:02,268 --> 01:48:03,893
. . .different.

1635
01:48:06,355 --> 01:48:09,399
Takes a real salesman,
I can tell you that.

1636
01:48:09,608 --> 01:48:12,318
Anvils have a limited appeal, you know.

1637
01:48:18,742 --> 01:48:20,451
What am I doing?

1638
01:48:20,661 --> 01:48:22,912
If I miss that train, I'll lose my job.

1639
01:48:23,122 --> 01:48:25,081
And I got to leave word about Hill.

1640
01:48:26,083 --> 01:48:27,167
Leave word with me.

1641
01:48:27,376 --> 01:48:31,462
Not on your tintype, girlie-girl.

1642
01:48:31,630 --> 01:48:34,215
How do I know
you'll deliver these letters?

1643
01:48:34,383 --> 01:48:35,800
Try me.

1644
01:48:47,771 --> 01:48:49,606
There's your train! Run for it!

1645
01:48:49,815 --> 01:48:53,776
You double-dealing--
Who do you think you're protecting?

1646
01:48:54,361 --> 01:48:57,280
That guy's got a gal
in every county in lllinois. . .

1647
01:48:57,489 --> 01:49:01,451
. . .and he's taken it away from
every one of them. That's 102 counties!

1648
01:49:03,037 --> 01:49:07,582
Not counting the piano teachers
like you he cozies up to. ..

1649
01:49:07,791 --> 01:49:10,126
. . .just to keep your mouths shut!

1650
01:49:10,502 --> 01:49:13,630

heard the last of me, girlie-girl!

Why, Professor Hill!

Miss Marian.

You and Marian come up and set.

1662
01:49:57,675 --> 01:49:59,676
I've got some jelly on the stove.

1663

There's no jelly on the stove.

1664
01:50:01,929 --> 01:50:04,180
Well, I'll put some on!

1665
01:50:08,227 --> 01:50:12,272
- Shall we "set," as your mother said?
- Really, I don't--

1666
01:50:12,523 --> 01:50:15,066
You did ask me to call. Remember?

1667
01:50:15,234 --> 01:50:17,735
Did I? I didn't mean anything.

1668
01:50:17,945 --> 01:50:20,822
I'm not suggesting
your invitation inferred. . .

1669
01:50:21,031 --> 01:50:23,533
. . .anything but academic enlightenment.

1670
01:50:25,703 --> 01:50:27,120
The Think System.

1671
01:50:28,205 --> 01:50:30,456
I've been by your house
to explain it to you. . .

1672
01:50:30,666 --> 01:50:33,251
. . .but there always seem
to be people around.

1673
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:35,461
Ladies mostly, I thought.

1674
01:50:35,713 --> 01:50:38,881
Yes. Mrs. Squires
and several of the other ladies.

1675
01:50:39,049 --> 01:50:40,425
I'm glad.

1676
01:50:40,926 --> 01:50:43,303
I wouldn't want anyone beating my time.

1677
01:50:46,807 --> 01:50:48,182
"You wouldn't?"

1678
01:50:49,977 --> 01:50:51,227
"No, ma'am."

1679
01:50:53,605 --> 01:50:56,274
It's evidently not
the convenient evening.

1680
01:50:56,817 --> 01:50:58,359
I'll see you at the sociable.

1681
01:50:58,569 --> 01:51:01,487
Professor Hill, is it true
that you've had 100--?

1682
01:51:02,906 --> 01:51:05,241
- What I'm trying to say is--
- Yes?

1683
01:51:05,826 --> 01:51:07,660
I was wondering...

1684
01:51:09,163 --> 01:51:12,915
. . .how you developed the Think System.

1685
01:51:13,083 --> 01:51:14,584
The Think System?

1686
01:51:15,252 --> 01:51:16,669
Oh, the Think System!

1687
01:51:16,879 --> 01:51:20,757
It's quite simple, really.
It's as simple as whistling.

1688
01:51:20,966 --> 01:51:24,135
No one had to develop an
elaborate technique for whistling.

1689
01:51:24,345 --> 01:51:26,471
You simply think the tune up here...

1690
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:28,973
. . .and it comes out clearly here.

1691
01:51:32,603 --> 01:51:35,104
Now just suppose you try this yourself.

1692
01:51:36,482 --> 01:51:37,899
I'll take your word for it.

1693
01:51:39,526 --> 01:51:41,527
Why don't we all sit down?

1694
01:51:42,363 --> 01:51:45,615
Are all music teachers
as dense as I am?

1695
01:51:46,992 --> 01:51:48,409
All music teachers?

1696
01:51:49,495 --> 01:51:53,206
I daresay you've met dozens.
Maybe even a hundred.

1697
01:51:53,874 --> 01:51:57,377
- Well--
- Are they all as fascinated as I...

1698
01:51:59,630 --> 01:52:01,506
. . .with the Think System?

1699
01:52:01,965 --> 01:52:03,674
Some more and some less.

1700
01:52:03,884 --> 01:52:06,969
One young lady had thought
up the same system.

1701
01:52:07,221 --> 01:52:08,805
She showed me a few refinements.

1702
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:11,391
I see.

1703
01:52:11,809 --> 01:52:13,643
Have I said something wrong?

1704
01:52:14,645 --> 01:52:17,021
Please don't let me keep you.

1705
01:52:17,231 --> 01:52:19,482
You must have more important
things to do. ..

1706
01:52:19,650 --> 01:52:22,026
. . .than explain the Think System to me.

1707
01:52:22,236 --> 01:52:24,278
Nope, can't think of one.
Come, let's sit.

1708
01:52:24,488 --> 01:52:27,949
I must be very dull company
for a man of your experience.

1709
01:52:28,158 --> 01:52:31,077
Now where'd you ever get
an idea like that? Heh-heh.

1710
01:52:31,537 --> 01:52:34,038
One hears rumors about
traveling salesmen.

1711
01:52:34,248 --> 01:52:37,333
Oh, now, you mustn't
believe everything you hear.

1712
01:52:37,543 --> 01:52:41,337
After all, one even hears rumors
about librarians.

1713
01:52:42,798 --> 01:52:45,133
I presume you're referring
to Uncle Maddy?

1714
01:52:46,176 --> 01:52:50,054
- Uncle Maddy?
- Mr. Madison, my father's best friend.

1715
01:52:50,264 --> 01:52:53,474
No matter what they say,
he left that library job to me. . .

1716
01:52:53,684 --> 01:52:56,310
. . .so Mother, Winthrop and l
could have security.

1717
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:58,271
Surely, you don't believe--

1718
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:00,857
No, but that's just what I'm saying.

1719
01:53:01,066 --> 01:53:03,276
Why do you suppose
people start rumors?

1720
01:53:03,694 --> 01:53:05,278
Narrow-mindedness, jealousy.

1721
01:53:05,696 --> 01:53:07,113
Jealousy mostly, I guess.

1722
01:53:07,322 --> 01:53:08,364
Exactly!

1723
01:53:08,574 --> 01:53:11,868
And jealousy mostly starts
rumors about traveling salesmen.

1724
01:53:25,674 --> 01:53:27,341
What have you heard?

1725
01:53:28,385 --> 01:53:29,469
Oh.

1726
01:53:29,636 --> 01:53:32,180
Nothing about you personally.
It's just...

1727
01:53:32,389 --> 01:53:34,640
. . .you know, generally.

1728
01:53:36,268 --> 01:53:38,895
What have you heard generally?

1729
01:53:40,063 --> 01:53:41,522
Just that--

1730
01:53:43,025 --> 01:53:45,067
But of course!

1731
01:53:45,861 --> 01:53:50,740
It stands to reason that disappointment
and jealousy can lead to--

1732
01:53:50,949 --> 01:53:55,244
Well, take you, for instance.
Your attentions to customers. ..

1733
01:53:55,412 --> 01:53:58,414
. . .and teachers might easily be
misconstrued, mightn't they?

1734
01:53:58,916 --> 01:54:01,584
I mean now, honestly, mightn't they?

1735
01:54:01,752 --> 01:54:05,254
And as you say, if a salesman
or somebody were jealous.. .

1736
01:54:05,464 --> 01:54:08,591
. . .they could be downright lies,
now, couldn't they?

1737
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:11,427
- What could?
- Rumors and things!

1738
01:54:11,595 --> 01:54:12,803
Of course!

1739
01:54:13,013 --> 01:54:16,390
It goes to show, you should never
believe everything you hear!

1740
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:19,810
I mean, if you just discuss things!

1741
01:54:20,020 --> 01:54:21,938
I'd be delighted to discuss. . .

1742
01:54:22,105 --> 01:54:25,107
. . .anything in the world with you.

1743
01:54:26,193 --> 01:54:28,236
But couldn't we do it sitting down?

1744
01:54:29,696 --> 01:54:30,780
You do sit?

1745
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:33,741
Your knees bend and all?

1746
01:54:35,035 --> 01:54:38,246
We could sit on the steps, I suppose.

1747
01:54:38,455 --> 01:54:40,957
Or on the large hollow log
over at the footbridge.

1748
01:54:41,458 --> 01:54:43,918
No, I couldn't do that.

1749
01:54:45,087 --> 01:54:47,797
I've never been to the footbridge
with a man in my life.

1750
01:54:48,131 --> 01:54:49,465
Just to talk.

1751
01:54:51,301 --> 01:54:53,803
I have to dress for the sociable.

1752
01:54:57,641 --> 01:54:59,976
Then meet me there in 15 minutes.

1753
01:55:00,894 --> 01:55:02,728
No, I can't.

1754
01:55:02,938 --> 01:55:04,438
Please.

1755
01:55:04,982 --> 01:55:07,900
Some other time.
Maybe tomorrow.

1756
01:55:08,986 --> 01:55:10,444
Please.

1757
01:55:11,947 --> 01:55:15,283
Oh, my dear little librarian!

1758
01:55:15,659 --> 01:55:18,369
You pile up enough tomorrows
and you'll collect. . .

1759
01:55:18,579 --> 01:55:21,914
. . .nothing but a lot
of empty yesterdays.

1760
01:55:23,875 --> 01:55:25,751
I don't know about you. . .

1761
01:55:26,670 --> 01:55:29,463
. . .but I'd like to make today
worth remembering.

1762
01:55:31,508 --> 01:55:33,759
Oh. . . .

1763
01:55:34,678 --> 01:55:36,304
So would I .

1764
01:55:40,267 --> 01:55:41,976
The footbridge. . .

1765
01:55:42,185 --> 01:55:43,853
. . . 15 minutes.

1766
01:55:53,822 --> 01:55:55,865
Fifteen minutes.

1767
01:56:13,050 --> 01:56:15,134
MARIAN: Mama!
- What?!

1768
01:56:15,802 --> 01:56:19,472
I told the professor I'd meet him
at the footbridge in 15 minutes.

1769
01:56:19,681 --> 01:56:21,641
Glory be and the saints be praised!

1770
01:56:21,808 --> 01:56:23,392
- It works!
- What works?

1771
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:28,230
I been using the "Tink" System
on you from the parlor.

1772
01:56:50,003 --> 01:56:52,838
Any of you people Mayor Shinn?

1773
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:19,407
Please, you got to clear this area.

1774
01:57:19,616 --> 01:57:22,076
Mrs. Shinn wants
to start the entertainment.

1775
01:57:23,620 --> 01:57:25,037
No, we want to dance.

1776
01:57:26,456 --> 01:57:29,125
Wait'll you see the new steps
Professor Hill taught us.

1777
01:57:29,292 --> 01:57:32,461
Mr. Washburn,
my group is ready to perform.

1778
01:57:34,631 --> 01:57:36,924
- Start her out.
- Okay, what'll it be?

01:57:37,134 --> 01:57:38,300

This is no place to talk.
You won't back down?

1823
02:02:53,700 --> 02:02:56,076
I'll come, but I promised
Mother and Winthrop. . .

1824
02:02:56,286 --> 02:03:00,122
. . .to have a plate of cream with them.
You go along, I'll meet you.

1825
02:03:01,124 --> 02:03:06,837
Fifteen minutes.

1826
02:03:18,308 --> 02:03:21,935
SHINN: And now we arrive
at the high-water mark...

1827
02:03:22,145 --> 02:03:23,812
. . .of the evening's festivities.

1828
02:03:24,314 --> 02:03:27,483
The River City Ladies'
Eurhythmic Dance Group. . .

1829
02:03:27,692 --> 02:03:30,486
. . .under the leadership of my wife. . .

1830
02:03:30,820 --> 02:03:34,490
. . .will give their interpretation of....

1831
02:03:34,657 --> 02:03:35,783
EULALIE:
Psst.

1832
02:03:36,326 --> 02:03:38,869
Grecian urns!

1833
02:03:39,412 --> 02:03:41,997
Yes. Grecian urns.

1834
02:03:44,459 --> 02:03:45,751
Psst. Psst.

1835
02:04:09,359 --> 02:04:12,069
One Grecian urn.

1836
02:05:24,809 --> 02:05:26,977
Miss Marian, you're late.

1837
02:05:28,104 --> 02:05:31,899
- You said 15 minutes.
- Not that kind of late. I meant. . . .

1838
02:05:32,108 --> 02:05:33,609
I'd say about. . .

1839
02:05:33,776 --> 02:05:35,319
. . .26 years late.

1840
02:05:35,528 --> 02:05:38,947
It took you all this time to get
to the footbridge with a fella.

1841
02:05:39,532 --> 02:05:42,451
If you want to know the truth,
it was almost longer.

1842
02:05:42,619 --> 02:05:44,536
- Oh?
- Halfway here. ..

1843
02:05:44,746 --> 02:05:46,788
. . . I nearly turned back.

1844
02:05:47,207 --> 02:05:50,209
I suppose I'm not
the first person to discover...

1845
02:05:50,418 --> 02:05:53,629
. . .a girl doesn't think clearly
under the spell of your salesmanship.

1846
02:05:55,131 --> 02:05:59,176
You surely don't think I've
been trying to sell you anything?

1847
02:05:59,385 --> 02:06:00,969
Oh, no.

1848
02:06:01,137 --> 02:06:04,306
You've given me something.
That's why I had to come.

1849
02:06:05,683 --> 02:06:07,392
- I don't recall giving you--
- Yes.

1850
02:06:08,144 --> 02:06:09,603
Something beautiful.

1851
02:06:09,812 --> 02:06:11,813
That's why I came.

1852
02:06:12,315 --> 02:06:13,649
And I'm so glad.

1853
02:06:15,026 --> 02:06:17,653
Please don't be afraid
I expect too much more.

1854
02:06:18,321 --> 02:06:21,323
One can't expect
a traveling salesman to stay put.

1855
02:06:21,491 --> 02:06:24,826
There've been many ports of call
and there'll be many more.

1856
02:06:25,036 --> 02:06:28,747
Still, I can be grateful
for what you've left behind.

1857
02:06:28,957 --> 02:06:30,249
For me.

1858
02:06:31,626 --> 02:06:33,001

Marian.

1887
02:09:16,833 --> 02:09:19,209
There's lots you don't know about me.

1888
02:09:21,421 --> 02:09:23,046
I'm not asking.

1889
02:09:24,924 --> 02:09:26,341
Excuse me.

1890
02:09:27,176 --> 02:09:30,262
I'm expecting a telegram from Rudi Friml.

1891
02:09:30,471 --> 02:09:32,347
This could be it.

1892
02:09:37,562 --> 02:09:41,189
Who's the salesman? Looks like
she's selling and you're buying.

1893
02:09:41,399 --> 02:09:42,983
I have to keep her off balance.

1894
02:09:43,276 --> 02:09:46,528
She's as off balance as
a catboat in a hurricane.

1895
02:09:46,737 --> 02:09:48,780
It's just until those uniforms arrive.

1896
02:09:48,990 --> 02:09:51,283
They're here and the kids are in them.

1897
02:09:51,868 --> 02:09:55,328
Tommy passed out the uniforms
and collected most of the money.

1898
02:09:55,538 --> 02:09:59,458
Now he's pretending there's
a band practice at the lumberyard.

1899
02:10:00,001 --> 02:10:03,378
- What time's the freight train go?
- 9:40 from the junction.

1900
02:10:03,588 --> 02:10:05,172
It isn't even 8:30 yet.

1901
02:10:05,506 --> 02:10:07,674
You better cheese it now while you can!

1902
02:10:07,884 --> 02:10:10,510
I came up through the ranks
on this skirmish.

1903
02:10:10,720 --> 02:10:12,804
I won't resign without my commission.

1904
02:10:13,097 --> 02:10:14,848
Now go on, beat it!

1905
02:10:19,437 --> 02:10:22,564
Never a peaceful moment
in the music business.

1906
02:10:24,317 --> 02:10:25,525
Now where were we?

1907
02:10:26,903 --> 02:10:29,571
You were going to tell me
what I don't know about you.

1908
02:10:31,532 --> 02:10:33,366
Yeah.

1909
02:10:34,118 --> 02:10:36,411
But we don't have to go
into that right now.

1910
02:10:37,538 --> 02:10:39,331
Of course not.

1911
02:10:40,166 --> 02:10:42,417
We never have to go into that, Harold.

1912
02:10:43,544 --> 02:10:47,631
Madam Librarian, you are a lady
from the ground up.

1913
02:10:47,882 --> 02:10:51,259
The librarian hasn't felt much like
doing research lately.

1914
02:10:52,178 --> 02:10:54,804
But she did plenty of it
when you first came here.

1915
02:10:55,223 --> 02:10:56,681
Oh.

1916
02:10:56,849 --> 02:10:57,891
About what?

1917
02:10:58,351 --> 02:11:01,728
Oh. About Professor Harold Hill.. .

1918
02:11:01,938 --> 02:11:05,232
. . .Gary Conservatory of Music,
Gold Medal Class of '05.

1919
02:11:08,110 --> 02:11:09,152
Harold. . .

1920
02:11:09,320 --> 02:11:12,489
. . .there wasn't any
Gary Conservatory in '05.

1921
02:11:13,449 --> 02:11:14,908
Well, there most cert--

1922
02:11:15,076 --> 02:11:17,702
The town wasn't even built until '06.

1923
02:11:20,498 --> 02:11:21,748
Walk me home.

1924
02:11:21,958 --> 02:11:24,918
I have to get something
to draw around my shoulders.

1925
02:11:26,462 --> 02:11:27,837
You knew all the time.

1926
02:11:28,798 --> 02:11:31,758
I've known since
three days after you came here.

1927
02:11:34,679 --> 02:11:37,472
I tore this out of the Indiana Journal.

1928
02:11:37,682 --> 02:11:40,058
I meant to use it against you.

1929
02:11:40,768 --> 02:11:42,769
Now I give it to you with all my heart.

1930
02:11:45,523 --> 02:11:47,315

Why, you boneheaded, square-toed. . .

. . .tank town boobs!

1943
02:12:44,707 --> 02:12:46,166
I've been trying to tell you!

1944
02:12:46,375 --> 02:12:50,587
Can't you see this music fella's
giving you the double shuffle!

1945
02:12:50,796 --> 02:12:52,380
He's putting the shake on you. . .

1946
02:12:52,590 --> 02:12:56,176
. . .taking out your eyeteeth
while you look the other way.

1947
02:12:56,385 --> 02:12:57,636
What are you saying?

1948
02:12:57,970 --> 02:12:59,721
I'll tell you what I'm saying!

1949
02:12:59,889 --> 02:13:04,517
This burglar's in the bedroom
while you're fiddling in the parlor!

1950
02:13:05,227 --> 02:13:07,228
Whose bedroom are
the burglars fiddling in?

1951
02:13:07,396 --> 02:13:08,438
Quiet.

1952
02:13:08,648 --> 02:13:10,523
CHARLIE:
I'm talking about Harold Hill.

1953
02:13:10,733 --> 02:13:12,025
A shell worker.

1954
02:13:12,318 --> 02:13:13,485
A flimflammer!

1955
02:13:13,694 --> 02:13:15,737
An eighteen-karat thief!

1956
02:13:15,905 --> 02:13:17,405
You mean the music professor?

1957
02:13:17,573 --> 02:13:19,407
Music professor?

1958
02:13:19,617 --> 02:13:22,410
Not on your fireless cooker, mister!

1959
02:13:22,578 --> 02:13:23,912
Fellow that organized the band?

1960
02:13:24,246 --> 02:13:26,831
There ain't any band.
There ain't never been a band.

1961
02:13:27,041 --> 02:13:29,250
There ain't never going to be a band!

1962
02:13:29,418 --> 02:13:32,420
Unless you hunt this man down now
like a mad dog. . .

1963
02:13:32,588 --> 02:13:34,673
. . .there won't be a Harold Hill either.

1964
02:13:34,924 --> 02:13:36,841
He'll be on his way to the state line.

1965
02:13:37,051 --> 02:13:40,136
I said all along,
get his credentials, didn't I?

1966
02:13:40,346 --> 02:13:43,181
I got his credentials right here!

1967
02:13:43,432 --> 02:13:45,225
Well, what are we waiting for?

1968
02:13:45,726 --> 02:13:46,810
I want my money back.

1969
02:13:47,019 --> 02:13:48,061
I want his hide!

1970
02:13:48,437 --> 02:13:50,438
Find him and bring him to the school.

1971

Roped and hogtied, if you have to.

1972
02:13:52,775 --> 02:13:54,567
And don't let him give you the slip.

1973
02:13:54,777 --> 02:13:56,277
All right, after him!

1974
02:14:48,539 --> 02:14:49,956
Have you seen Professor Hill?

1975
02:14:50,166 --> 02:14:52,417

Try the livery stable!

Try the freight depot!

1997
02:17:41,295 --> 02:17:42,337
Let's go, Greg.

1998
02:17:42,504 --> 02:17:44,964
The flivver's in the alley,
all cranked up!

1999
02:17:45,841 --> 02:17:47,842
They're onto you!
That anvil salesman...

2000
02:17:48,010 --> 02:17:50,803
. . .is running all over town
spilling everything!

2001
02:17:51,680 --> 02:17:53,014
Come on!

2002
02:17:55,267 --> 02:17:59,103
Run, professor!
They're talking about tar and feathers.

2003
02:17:59,313 --> 02:18:02,357
I've looked all over for Winthrop.
He's run away.

2004
02:18:02,566 --> 02:18:04,359
Maybe he's in his room.

2005
02:18:10,824 --> 02:18:12,909
It's not often I'm at a loss for words--

2006
02:18:13,118 --> 02:18:15,453
It's all right.
Don't you know that?

2007
02:18:15,663 --> 02:18:17,580
You don't owe me a word,
not a word.

2008
02:18:17,790 --> 02:18:19,749
Now hurry, please!

2009
02:18:21,710 --> 02:18:23,211
Greg!

2010
02:18:25,881 --> 02:18:27,382
He's not around here, folks!

2011
02:18:28,050 --> 02:18:29,634
Let's try by the creamery.

2012
02:18:35,474 --> 02:18:38,518
- Whoa. Hold on a minute, son.
- I'm not your son. Leave me go!

2013
02:18:38,686 --> 02:18:40,645
Not until I talk to you a minute.

2014
02:18:40,813 --> 02:18:43,189
I won't listen.
You wouldn't tell the truth anyway.

2015
02:18:43,357 --> 02:18:44,440
- I would too.
- Would tot!

2016
02:18:44,608 --> 02:18:46,901
Tell you anything you want to know.

2017
02:18:47,987 --> 02:18:49,320
Can you lead a band?

2018
02:18:52,199 --> 02:18:53,241
No!

2019
02:18:54,576 --> 02:18:56,953

- Yes.

02:18:57,413 --> 02:18:59,247

- Yes.

Then leave me go, you big liar!

2022

You wanted the truth, didn't you?

2023
02:19:04,461 --> 02:19:06,504
I'm bigger than you,
and you're getting it all.

So just stop wiggling.

Now.. . .

2026
02:19:11,218 --> 02:19:13,594
There are two things
you're entitled to know.

2027
02:19:13,804 --> 02:19:16,222
One, you're a wonderful kid.

2028
02:19:16,557 --> 02:19:19,517
I thought so from the first.
That's why I wanted you in the band. . .

2029
02:19:19,685 --> 02:19:22,770
. . .so you'd stop moping around
and feeling sorry for yourself.

2030
02:19:24,023 --> 02:19:25,815
What band?

2031
02:19:28,694 --> 02:19:30,528
I always think there's a band, kid.

2032
02:19:31,405 --> 02:19:33,448
WINTHROP: What's the other thing
I'm entitled to know?

2033
02:19:36,618 --> 02:19:39,037
That's none of your business,
come to think of it.

2034
02:19:39,246 --> 02:19:41,581
I wish you never came to River City.

2035
02:19:44,126 --> 02:19:45,460
No, you don't, Winthrop.

2036
02:19:47,838 --> 02:19:50,048
Sister, you believe him?

2037
02:19:53,260 --> 02:19:55,344
I believe everything he ever said.

2038
02:19:57,056 --> 02:19:59,307
WINTHROP:
But he promised us!

2039
02:19:59,641 --> 02:20:03,811
I know what he promised us,
and it all happened just like he said:

2040
02:20:03,979 --> 02:20:07,106
The lights, the colors,
the cymbals and the flags.

2041
02:20:08,025 --> 02:20:09,358
Where was all that?

2042
02:20:10,152 --> 02:20:13,362
In the way every kid in town
walked around all summer. . .

2043
02:20:13,572 --> 02:20:15,239
. . .and looked and acted.

2044
02:20:15,449 --> 02:20:17,116
Especially you.

2045
02:20:17,326 --> 02:20:19,410
And the parents too.

2046
02:20:20,329 --> 02:20:22,246
Does Mama wish he'd never come?

2047
02:20:23,123 --> 02:20:25,041
Well, you do, don't you?

2048
02:20:27,044 --> 02:20:28,753
No, Winthrop.

Go on, professor.

Hurry up.

I can't go, Winthrop.

Well, for the first time in my life. . .

That professor collected almost
$300 on uniforms just tonight.

2072
02:22:25,162 --> 02:22:29,248
I haven't seen a uniform or my boy
either since just after supper.

your everlasting Iowa stubbornness. . .

this town was like before Harold Hill came.

Suddenly there were things to do. . .

out of your way for.
