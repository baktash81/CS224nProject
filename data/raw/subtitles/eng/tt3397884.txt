1
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:31,931
Get down! Get down!

2
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:33,078
Don't move!

3
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:34,637
FBI! Don't move!

4
00:02:36,351 --> 00:02:37,512
Get down! Get down!

5
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:40,402
Where are the hostages?
Where are the hostages?

6
00:02:40,671 --> 00:02:42,811
- FBI, Police! Don't move!
- Down! Stay down!

7
00:02:42,911 --> 00:02:45,971
Cross your legs!
Cross your legs and put your hands in the air!

8
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:48,211
Police! Don't move!
Police! Don't move!

9
00:02:48,311 --> 00:02:50,075
Get down! Get down!

10
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:53,238
- Clear!
- Police! Search warrant. Don't move!

11
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:56,271
- Steppin' out!
- Police, don't move!

12
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:59,000
Police, don't move! Search warrant!

13
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:02,197
FBI!

14
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:10,238
Are you hit?

15
00:03:10,351 --> 00:03:11,398
I'm good.

16
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:12,931
Fuck!

17
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:14,396
Front room, clear!

18
00:03:14,991 --> 00:03:16,402
Team leader! Status?

19
00:03:16,591 --> 00:03:18,036
- Front clear!
- We're clear, ma'am!

20
00:03:18,271 --> 00:03:19,796
Two suspects in custody!

21
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:27,556
- You okay, Macer?
- Yeah.

22
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,998
Why'd he shoot? There's no one here.

23
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,515
What the fuck?

24
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:22,317
Jesus!

25
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,041
Those weren't our hostages.

26
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:36,472
No. That was something else.

27
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:38,491
- Macer?
- Yeah?

28
00:04:38,591 --> 00:04:40,881
U.S. Attorney wants a statement.
What do you want me to say to her?

29
00:04:40,951 --> 00:04:42,032
The truth.

30
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:36,155
Looks like Sonora...

31
00:05:37,311 --> 00:05:38,358
Yeah.

32
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:41,752
How many total?

33
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,953
We've got 15 in this hall here,
about 20 in the back bedroom.

34
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:49,001
We haven't even checked the attic
or under the crawl space.

35
00:05:49,191 --> 00:05:51,193
Call DOJ, let 'em know what we have.

36
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:56,875
This one of the houses
owned by Manuel Diaz?

37
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,592
No way to connect him, but he owns it.

38
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:03,512
Jesus Christ.

39
00:06:05,111 --> 00:06:07,159
Reg, step out. It's okay.

40
00:06:31,871 --> 00:06:33,999
Vickers! I need bolt cutters!

41
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:45,232
Vickers!

42
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:47,476
PD found something.

43
00:07:55,511 --> 00:07:56,797
Relax.

44
00:08:03,631 --> 00:08:04,632
Relax.

45
00:08:06,991 --> 00:08:08,531
<i>Such a heavy body count</i>

46
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:09,792
<i>this close to Phoenix</i>

47
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:13,491
<i>is without a doubt a major escalation
for the cartels.</i>

48
00:08:13,591 --> 00:08:17,571
<i>There will be pressure in Washington
to explain how such a dramatic outrage</i>

49
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:20,959
<i>could happen so deep inside
the American heartland.</i>

50
00:08:21,311 --> 00:08:23,651
<i>We may be talking about the victims
of a turf war</i>

51
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:25,331
<i>or maybe some illegal immigrants</i>

52
00:08:25,431 --> 00:08:26,851
<i>who are tied to a ransom,</i>

53
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:28,491
<i>but it will be some weeks</i>

54
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,958
<i>before we have a clearer picture
on who the victims...</i>

55
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,202
What's goin' on?

56
00:08:40,631 --> 00:08:41,678
I have no idea.

57
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:45,531
<i>She's been leading
our kidnap response team for three years.</i>

58
00:08:45,631 --> 00:08:49,078
<i>Put her through the grinder since
she got here, and she hasn't blinked.</i>

59
00:08:49,271 --> 00:08:50,651
<i>She's in the front line.</i>

60
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:53,721
<i>Nobody's gonna be happier than Kate
to see these guys go down.</i>

61
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:55,491
So she's a thumper.

62
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:57,811
Today was her fifth O.I.S.

63
00:08:57,911 --> 00:08:59,811
5-and-0, not bad for a rookie.

64
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:01,251
She never worked cases?

65
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:03,319
Been kicking doors since day one.

66
00:09:03,431 --> 00:09:06,451
I like her already. What about the partner?
He seen any action?

67
00:09:06,551 --> 00:09:08,331
He's only been with us 18 months.

68
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:09,811
What's his background?

69
00:09:09,911 --> 00:09:11,771
He's a sharp kid.

70
00:09:11,871 --> 00:09:13,971
ROTC scholarship to Maryland,

71
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:17,120
did a tour in Iraq,
got his law degree from UNC.

72
00:09:18,551 --> 00:09:20,758
He's green, but he's good.

73
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:23,835
No lawyers on this train.
Just give me the girl.

74
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,371
We did this by the book, right?

75
00:09:26,471 --> 00:09:28,200
Come on, of course.

76
00:09:36,671 --> 00:09:38,275
- Jesus.
- What?

77
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:40,371
Oh, shit.

78
00:09:40,471 --> 00:09:41,711
Would you step in here, Kate?

79
00:09:54,871 --> 00:09:58,592
Quite a find today,
the loss of two officers notwithstanding.

80
00:09:59,871 --> 00:10:01,032
Yes, sir.

81
00:10:01,511 --> 00:10:04,481
How familiar are you
with Manuel Diaz's operation?

82
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:08,592
His company, Sun Oasis,
has 80 or so foreclosure properties.

83
00:10:08,871 --> 00:10:11,317
He has other legitimate businesses.

84
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:14,600
But he's rumored to be linked
with one of the Mexican cartels.

85
00:10:15,351 --> 00:10:17,922
Manuel Diaz works
for the Sonora Cartel.

86
00:10:18,191 --> 00:10:20,512
He's most likely their senior member
in the United States.

87
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:22,992
What do you know about his brother?

88
00:10:24,111 --> 00:10:25,681
I wasn't aware he had one.

89
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:28,691
Guillermo. His brother's name is Guillermo.

90
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,241
Do you know anything about his cousin?

91
00:10:30,311 --> 00:10:32,601
I didn't know he had one of those either.
None of that is in his file.

92
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:34,594
His cousin is Fausto Alarcon.

93
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,131
I don't know who that is.

94
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:39,011
No one does. He's off the grid.

95
00:10:39,111 --> 00:10:40,991
He's number three
in the Sonora Cartel.

96
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,441
This is not my department, sir.

97
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:46,122
Like I said,
Agent Macer doesn't work narcotics.

98
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:48,393
She runs a kidnap response team.

99
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:49,832
Are you married?

100
00:10:51,111 --> 00:10:52,476
Am I married?

101
00:10:52,671 --> 00:10:54,480
Do you have a husband?

102
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,031
Divorced.

103
00:11:00,231 --> 00:11:01,357
Kids?

104
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:03,632
No.

105
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,202
Anything else?

106
00:11:08,511 --> 00:11:11,879
No. Thanks, Kate.
If you could wait outside, please.

107
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,436
- Well?
- I have no clue.

108
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:26,393
Who are those people?
You know?

109
00:11:28,351 --> 00:11:29,716
No idea.

110
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:40,716
Thanks for coming in, guys.

111
00:11:42,431 --> 00:11:44,957
Will you come back in, Kate?

112
00:11:48,711 --> 00:11:53,717
DOJ wants advisors that focus on cartels
involved in pursuing Mr. Diaz.

113
00:11:54,271 --> 00:11:57,115
This is Matt Graver.
He'll be leading the team.

114
00:11:57,511 --> 00:11:59,832
Isn't this Phoenix homicide now?

115
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:03,319
No, we're expanding
the scope of the investigation a bit.

116
00:12:03,951 --> 00:12:05,291
You'll act as a liaison.

117
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,438
What does that mean?

118
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:10,051
They need an agent
with tactical experience, like you.

119
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:12,411
State Department is pulling
an agent from the field

120
00:12:12,511 --> 00:12:15,674
that specializes in responding
to escalated cartel activity.

121
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:18,153
You'll be part of the team.

122
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:21,036
You'll meet up with them
at Luke, tomorrow?

123
00:12:21,151 --> 00:12:22,331
Day after. Early.

124
00:12:22,431 --> 00:12:23,432
Air Force Base?

125
00:12:23,551 --> 00:12:24,921
Yeah, we're gonna go see Guillermo.

126
00:12:24,991 --> 00:12:26,251
Diaz's brother?

127
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:27,762
That's the one.

128
00:12:29,391 --> 00:12:30,392
Where is he?

129
00:12:30,631 --> 00:12:33,874
He's in the El Paso area.

130
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:37,831
What's our objective?

131
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,920
To dramatically overreact.

132
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:50,280
Kate, you must volunteer
for an inter-agency task force.

133
00:12:51,831 --> 00:12:54,118
Think very hard before you respond.

134
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:56,835
You wanna be a part of this?

135
00:12:59,031 --> 00:13:02,114
Do we get an opportunity
at the men responsible for today?

136
00:13:05,871 --> 00:13:08,841
The men who were really
responsible for today, yeah.

137
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:13,401
I'll volunteer.

138
00:13:28,551 --> 00:13:29,791
Papa!

139
00:13:32,552 --> 00:13:33,929
Dad, wake up!

140
00:13:35,722 --> 00:13:38,475
We need to go to my soccer match!

141
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,269
- You play soccer?
- Yes.

142
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:43,438
- You're sure?
- Yes!

143
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:45,328
No.

144
00:13:45,398 --> 00:13:47,692
Yes, Dad, we have to go!

145
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:55,367
Okay, let's go.

146
00:13:55,492 --> 00:13:58,703
Mama, make coffee and eggs for Papa!

147
00:13:58,828 --> 00:14:00,497
Yes, yes, my love.

148
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,371
You keep an eye
on that doughy prick

149
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:13,531
with the flip-flops.

150
00:15:13,631 --> 00:15:14,632
Don't trust him.

151
00:15:17,831 --> 00:15:18,931
How you doin', sir?

152
00:15:19,031 --> 00:15:20,271
I.D.'s?

153
00:15:28,151 --> 00:15:29,931
She's on the list, but you're not.

154
00:15:30,031 --> 00:15:31,161
Well, what's she supposed to do?

155
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:32,481
I need you to turn this around for me.

156
00:15:32,551 --> 00:15:33,996
It's fine. It's good.

157
00:15:34,831 --> 00:15:36,241
I'll call you when we're headed back.

158
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:37,551
All right.

159
00:15:59,031 --> 00:16:00,691
- Morning.
- Morning. Am I late?

160
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:03,237
No, no, no. We just landed.
Come on, this way.

161
00:16:04,911 --> 00:16:07,562
My bird dog over there, Alejandro.

162
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:12,771
Are we taking this?

163
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,033
Yeah. Only the best for you.

164
00:16:28,711 --> 00:16:31,251
DOD flies you around in private jets now?

165
00:16:31,351 --> 00:16:32,911
Yeah. You guys don't have one of these?

166
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:34,197
Right.

167
00:16:37,031 --> 00:16:38,920
Is there any food on this flight?

168
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,371
There's some bitchin'
peanuts in the back.

169
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,633
But it's kind of a self-serve deal.

170
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:56,122
Kate Macer.

171
00:16:57,111 --> 00:16:58,556
Have you been to Juárez before?

172
00:17:00,591 --> 00:17:03,834
No, I... We're goin' to El Paso, right?

173
00:17:04,031 --> 00:17:07,114
Yeah, amazing. Okay.

174
00:18:32,551 --> 00:18:33,962
Are you okay?

175
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:39,560
Yeah. I'm fine.

176
00:18:47,031 --> 00:18:48,317
So,

177
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:50,636
So this is your specialty?

178
00:18:52,391 --> 00:18:55,122
The cartels in Mexico are your specialty?

179
00:18:55,311 --> 00:18:57,393
Yeah. Yeah.

180
00:19:01,031 --> 00:19:02,556
Is there anything I should know?

181
00:19:04,551 --> 00:19:07,077
You're asking me how a watch works.

182
00:19:09,311 --> 00:19:11,837
For now, let's just keep
an eye on the time.

183
00:19:15,551 --> 00:19:16,757
Okay.

184
00:19:29,071 --> 00:19:30,091
How you doin'?

185
00:19:30,191 --> 00:19:31,955
Howdy! How you been?

186
00:19:32,151 --> 00:19:34,119
Good, buddy. How you feelin'?

187
00:19:34,311 --> 00:19:36,712
Well, when I pee, it burns.

188
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,076
Maybe it's gonorrhea.

189
00:19:39,631 --> 00:19:41,235
What color is it?

190
00:19:41,511 --> 00:19:43,479
Yellow with red specks.

191
00:19:43,591 --> 00:19:45,036
Red specks or blood?

192
00:19:47,511 --> 00:19:50,771
I'm tryin' to get DOD to let me
look into this conspiracy to sink Fiji.

193
00:19:50,871 --> 00:19:52,051
- Fiji?
- Yeah.

194
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:53,731
Leave Fiji alone, terrorists!

195
00:19:53,831 --> 00:19:55,851
Yeah. Exactly.
I figure a month or two over there,

196
00:19:55,951 --> 00:19:57,476
we'll get it all worked out.

197
00:19:57,711 --> 00:19:59,076
So who's goin' over there today?

198
00:19:59,191 --> 00:20:01,411
Marshals, DEA...
I pulled a team for you, Matt.

199
00:20:01,511 --> 00:20:04,121
Oh, man, I love it when you say "a team."
it makes me all warm and fuzzy.

200
00:20:04,191 --> 00:20:07,531
Oh, they're a crack bunch, too.
Just rotated back from Afghanistan.

201
00:20:07,631 --> 00:20:09,891
Wow. Where's everybody linking up?

202
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:11,436
A.I.C.

203
00:20:11,991 --> 00:20:13,755
Good, good, good.

204
00:20:24,831 --> 00:20:27,691
Mexican Federal Police
will meet you at the border

205
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,920
and proceed with you to the courthouse,
located here.

206
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:34,673
This is a high-level target.

207
00:20:37,551 --> 00:20:41,761
The most likely spots for an attempt
will be at the exchange

208
00:20:41,911 --> 00:20:44,357
and at the border crossing on the return.

209
00:20:45,431 --> 00:20:46,876
The Marshals will enter...

210
00:20:47,551 --> 00:20:49,394
Kevin, Keith, you wanna stand up?

211
00:20:51,191 --> 00:20:53,491
Now, the Marshals' response team
is in Laredo...

212
00:20:53,591 --> 00:20:54,672
Love Texans.

213
00:20:55,471 --> 00:20:57,712
So our friends from Delta
have volunteered to come along

214
00:20:57,831 --> 00:21:00,482
and will escort the Marshals
on the exchange.

215
00:21:01,111 --> 00:21:02,875
And here's the man of the hour.

216
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:04,882
You comin' with or waitin' here?

217
00:21:05,071 --> 00:21:07,571
We'll take the tour with you.
Loan us a couple pop guns.

218
00:21:07,671 --> 00:21:09,771
All right, this is turning
into an all-star affair!

219
00:21:09,871 --> 00:21:11,651
Keith, you want another hand
on the exchange?

220
00:21:11,751 --> 00:21:12,752
You sober?

221
00:21:13,471 --> 00:21:15,155
Will be by the time we get there.

222
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,731
Got a bottle in the truck
in case your hands get shaky.

223
00:21:17,831 --> 00:21:19,401
I know I could always
count on you, Keith.

224
00:21:19,471 --> 00:21:21,481
All right, we'll gear you up
as soon as we're done here.

225
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:25,771
Now, Matt, you can be the tip of the spear,
and we don't have to rob a guy from Delta.

226
00:21:25,871 --> 00:21:27,851
Now, be careful on the turnaround.

227
00:21:27,951 --> 00:21:30,511
If the Federale's a shooter,
it's gonna happen on the turnaround.

228
00:21:31,151 --> 00:21:33,251
Delta's Team One will be the lead vehicle.

229
00:21:33,351 --> 00:21:37,531
We can divide Team Two between the
carry car and the trail vehicle. That okay?

230
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,321
Good. Now, Delta,
if you can identify yourselves

231
00:21:39,391 --> 00:21:41,758
so everyone knows who to hide behind
if shit hits the fan.

232
00:21:42,991 --> 00:21:47,633
The most likely spot for a hit will be
at the border crossing on the return.

233
00:21:48,351 --> 00:21:52,356
Anywhere along the way, anyone not
in this room is a potential shooter.

234
00:21:54,031 --> 00:21:56,511
The op isn't over until we get back here.

235
00:21:57,271 --> 00:21:58,432
Okay?

236
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:02,235
Be alert. Be vigilant.
And be aware. Let's go.

237
00:22:03,831 --> 00:22:05,071
What?

238
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:15,121
Hey! I thought you were in prison.

239
00:22:15,351 --> 00:22:16,771
They took me out.

240
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:18,491
They needed somebody for this job.

241
00:22:18,591 --> 00:22:20,878
For good behavior or bad behavior?

242
00:22:27,751 --> 00:22:29,401
Have you ever been over there?

243
00:22:31,151 --> 00:22:32,835
I worked in Juárez.

244
00:22:36,111 --> 00:22:37,476
For the DEA?

245
00:22:38,351 --> 00:22:39,432
No.

246
00:22:40,991 --> 00:22:42,091
For who?

247
00:22:42,191 --> 00:22:43,477
For Mexico.

248
00:22:44,751 --> 00:22:46,435
I was a prosecutor.

249
00:22:50,471 --> 00:22:52,091
You're not American?

250
00:22:52,191 --> 00:22:53,131
No.

251
00:22:53,231 --> 00:22:54,881
Who do you work for now?

252
00:22:56,471 --> 00:22:58,155
Oh, I go where I'm sent.

253
00:22:59,631 --> 00:23:01,156
Where were you sent from?

254
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:04,162
Cartagena.

255
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:07,716
Colombia.

256
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:10,632
Listen...

257
00:23:11,631 --> 00:23:14,601
Nothing will make sense
to your American ears.

258
00:23:16,431 --> 00:23:18,559
And you will doubt everything that we do.

259
00:23:20,111 --> 00:23:22,034
But in the end,

260
00:23:22,351 --> 00:23:23,796
you will understand.

261
00:23:30,271 --> 00:23:32,478
Here, try this on. See if it fits.

262
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,919
Is he CIA? Are you?

263
00:23:36,111 --> 00:23:37,875
He's a DOD advisor, just like me.

264
00:23:38,031 --> 00:23:39,291
No, he's not.

265
00:23:39,391 --> 00:23:42,351
Just pay attention to Alejandro
and if he says to do somethin', just do it.

266
00:23:42,431 --> 00:23:44,672
I'm not authorized to follow orders
from Alejandro!

267
00:23:44,831 --> 00:23:46,091
Especially in Mexico!

268
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:47,522
Fine. Then stay here.

269
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:50,731
But you don't want to, do you?

270
00:23:50,831 --> 00:23:52,674
I just wanna know what I'm getting into.

271
00:23:54,031 --> 00:23:57,131
Kate, you volunteered to get on this train
because you know

272
00:23:57,231 --> 00:23:59,171
you're doing nothing in Phoenix.

273
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,751
Yeah, you're just sweeping up
a fucking mess.

274
00:24:02,031 --> 00:24:05,691
In six months, every single house you raid
will be rigged with explosives.

275
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:08,251
Do you want to find the guys responsible?
Yes or no?

276
00:24:08,351 --> 00:24:09,331
Yes.

277
00:24:09,431 --> 00:24:10,592
- Yes?
- Yes!

278
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:14,434
This is where we start.

279
00:24:15,191 --> 00:24:16,522
Try it on.

280
00:26:02,551 --> 00:26:03,962
There she is.

281
00:26:04,591 --> 00:26:05,922
The beast.

282
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:07,762
Juárez.

283
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:12,077
You know,

284
00:26:12,711 --> 00:26:16,511
1900s, President Taft
went to visit President Diaz.

285
00:26:17,111 --> 00:26:19,159
Took 4,000 men with him.

286
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,011
And it almost was called off.

287
00:26:22,111 --> 00:26:24,000
Some guy had a pistol.

288
00:26:24,151 --> 00:26:27,171
Was gonna walk right up to Taft
and just blow his brains out.

289
00:26:27,271 --> 00:26:30,514
But it was avoided. 4,000 troops!

290
00:26:31,551 --> 00:26:33,713
Think he felt safe?

291
00:28:48,751 --> 00:28:50,480
Welcome to Juárez.

292
00:29:29,871 --> 00:29:31,282
It's brilliant what they do.

293
00:29:32,951 --> 00:29:34,794
When they mutilate a body like that,

294
00:29:35,871 --> 00:29:37,761
they make people think
they must have been involved,

295
00:29:37,831 --> 00:29:41,233
they must have deserved such a death
'cause they did something.

296
00:29:42,271 --> 00:29:43,955
Oh, it's brilliant what they do.

297
00:30:06,231 --> 00:30:07,357
You hear that?

298
00:30:09,071 --> 00:30:10,596
Those aren't firecrackers.

299
00:30:13,191 --> 00:30:14,731
<i>Mexicans are adjusting our route.</i>

300
00:30:14,831 --> 00:30:16,731
<i>There's activity ahead,
we need to go around.</i>

301
00:30:16,831 --> 00:30:17,992
<i>Everyone hold on.</i>

302
00:31:48,311 --> 00:31:50,200
Nothing will happen here.

303
00:31:51,111 --> 00:31:52,875
They try anything,
it will be at the border.

304
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:02,318
Keep an eye out for the State Police.

305
00:32:04,311 --> 00:32:06,473
They're not always the good guys.

306
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:52,515
Spotter vehicle, left lane. Left lane!

307
00:32:52,751 --> 00:32:54,551
<i>Spotter vehicle, nine o'clock.</i>

308
00:32:54,831 --> 00:32:56,401
I'm gettin' a boner.

309
00:32:57,391 --> 00:32:58,931
<i>Is that one of ours?</i>

310
00:32:59,031 --> 00:33:00,760
Watch the right, watch the right.

311
00:33:01,031 --> 00:33:02,442
<i>No, that's a lone wolf.</i>

312
00:33:09,631 --> 00:33:10,962
<i>Eyes on rooftops.</i>

313
00:33:18,271 --> 00:33:19,432
<i>Nothing.</i>

314
00:33:19,751 --> 00:33:21,116
<i>Rooftops clear.</i>

315
00:33:22,831 --> 00:33:24,931
<i>Bridge is one klick out.</i>

316
00:33:25,031 --> 00:33:27,352
<i>Road is clear. Hotfoot it, gentlemen.</i>

317
00:33:35,231 --> 00:33:37,611
<i>Everyone stay in this lane.
Our agents at the border are</i>

318
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:40,237
<i>waving traffic through
to get us over as quickly as they can.</i>

319
00:33:52,991 --> 00:33:54,641
<i>Everyone stay frosty.</i>

320
00:34:00,111 --> 00:34:02,398
<i>Okay, it's a fuck-up.
What are we gonna do now?</i>

321
00:34:07,391 --> 00:34:10,474
<i>Here's the deal,
a car broke down up ahead.</i>

322
00:34:11,271 --> 00:34:14,798
<i>It's being sorted out,
but it's gonna take a while. Stand by.</i>

323
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:49,116
Get your service weapon out.

324
00:34:51,831 --> 00:34:54,811
Red Impala, two lanes over, on my ten.

325
00:34:54,911 --> 00:34:58,313
Copy that. Red Impala, two lanes left.

326
00:34:59,031 --> 00:35:00,192
<i>Roger that.</i>

327
00:35:11,311 --> 00:35:14,474
<i>Three lanes left. Seven o'clock.
Green Civic.</i>

328
00:35:24,231 --> 00:35:25,801
Bring your window down.

329
00:35:32,911 --> 00:35:34,037
Gun.

330
00:35:34,271 --> 00:35:35,931
Gun. Gun left!

331
00:35:36,031 --> 00:35:37,231
<i>What are the rules here?</i>

332
00:35:38,311 --> 00:35:40,632
<i>We must be engaged to engage.</i>

333
00:35:41,311 --> 00:35:44,235
<i>Permission to get out of the vehicle
and set a perimeter?</i>

334
00:35:44,591 --> 00:35:45,731
<i>Stay in your vehicle.</i>

335
00:35:45,831 --> 00:35:48,641
<i>You can do what they do.
If they get out, you get out.</i>

336
00:36:10,271 --> 00:36:12,811
<i>Get ready.
They can see our lane clearing.</i>

337
00:36:12,911 --> 00:36:14,356
<i>If it's coming, it's coming now.</i>

338
00:36:31,391 --> 00:36:33,280
<i>- Move!</i>
- Wait, wait, wait.

339
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:34,392
Get outta the car.

340
00:36:36,191 --> 00:36:37,397
Jesus Christ!

341
00:36:51,071 --> 00:36:52,391
Don't move! <i>Cálmate!</i>

342
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:54,117
No, no, no, no!

343
00:36:54,661 --> 00:36:56,622
In peace, in peace.

344
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:58,081
Put down the gun.

345
00:36:58,351 --> 00:37:00,351
Put it down!

346
00:37:03,685 --> 00:37:05,485
One question, boys...

347
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,299
Do you want to die?

348
00:37:13,551 --> 00:37:14,882
What the fuck are we doing?

349
00:37:36,431 --> 00:37:37,432
Fuck!

350
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:39,195
Lane's clear! The lane's clear!

351
00:37:39,351 --> 00:37:40,411
Don't look at me!

352
00:37:40,511 --> 00:37:44,232
Put your hands behind your head! Go!
Hands behind your head!

353
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:45,991
- All clear!
- I got this!

354
00:37:46,151 --> 00:37:47,721
Go, go, go!

355
00:37:50,951 --> 00:37:52,441
Move, move, move!

356
00:37:52,991 --> 00:37:54,531
<i>This is gonna be on the front page</i>

357
00:37:54,631 --> 00:37:56,171
<i>of every newspaper in America.</i>

358
00:37:56,271 --> 00:37:59,673
No, it won't.
It won't even make the papers in El Paso.

359
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:04,038
Clear!

360
00:38:26,071 --> 00:38:27,402
Come here.

361
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:53,451
Got a little nutty, huh?

362
00:38:53,551 --> 00:38:56,411
Nutty? Yeah.
Yeah, that was fucking illegal.

363
00:38:56,511 --> 00:38:59,481
You wanna start a war?
You're a fucking spook!

364
00:38:59,591 --> 00:39:01,891
And him! I mean, who the fuck is that?

365
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:03,161
Told you, you could stay here.

366
00:39:03,231 --> 00:39:06,251
Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.
You just spray bullets at...

367
00:39:06,351 --> 00:39:08,611
Yeah, sure there's just
fucking civilians everywhere.

368
00:39:08,711 --> 00:39:10,351
I'm not a soldier! This is not what I do!

369
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,091
Don't sell yourself short, all right?

370
00:39:13,191 --> 00:39:16,320
The reason Reggie's home is
I know he wasn't ready for this.

371
00:39:16,431 --> 00:39:19,811
But he better get ready real quick
because this is the future, Kate!

372
00:39:19,911 --> 00:39:22,371
Juárez is what happens when they dig in.
This is it!

373
00:39:22,471 --> 00:39:23,451
What am I doing here?

374
00:39:23,551 --> 00:39:25,801
What you're doing here is
you're giving us the opportunity

375
00:39:25,871 --> 00:39:27,611
to shake the tree and create chaos.

376
00:39:27,711 --> 00:39:28,997
That's what this is!

377
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:34,131
In the meantime,
just sponge everything up you see.

378
00:39:34,231 --> 00:39:36,393
Learn! That's why you're here.

379
00:39:59,511 --> 00:40:01,081
Guillermo...

380
00:40:04,551 --> 00:40:07,441
You're giving him a belly full of water,
you devil.

381
00:40:12,231 --> 00:40:14,313
You didn't think
we'd get you here, did you?

382
00:40:14,821 --> 00:40:17,921
- I don't speak English.
- You don't speak English?

383
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,700
<i>That's not good.</i>

384
00:40:23,431 --> 00:40:25,798
I love it when they <i>no hablo Inglés.</i>

385
00:40:27,751 --> 00:40:30,357
You know, I brought an old buddy of yours.

386
00:40:31,351 --> 00:40:34,639
I bet you <i>hablo</i> to him. Yeah.

387
00:40:43,471 --> 00:40:45,838
I didn't know ghosts got thirsty.

388
00:40:51,191 --> 00:40:53,797
I know someone kept him alive for us.

389
00:40:56,711 --> 00:40:58,315
I doubt it was easy.

390
00:40:59,031 --> 00:41:00,954
What's easy these days?

391
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:04,011
I'm sorry about
what happened on the return.

392
00:41:04,111 --> 00:41:05,840
I control only what I can.

393
00:41:07,391 --> 00:41:08,875
It's not your fault.

394
00:41:09,124 --> 00:41:11,001
- How is your wife?
- She's well.

395
00:41:11,126 --> 00:41:14,129
We have 2 boys.
6 and 8 years old.

396
00:41:18,133 --> 00:41:19,342
In Juarez?

397
00:41:19,718 --> 00:41:21,303
No, Monterey.

398
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,596
Much better.

399
00:41:22,721 --> 00:41:23,972
- It's more peaceful.
- Yes.

400
00:41:25,671 --> 00:41:27,514
There's rumors of a tunnel.

401
00:41:28,031 --> 00:41:30,477
Fausto's main road into Arizona.

402
00:41:31,191 --> 00:41:34,811
If you're doing what I think you're doing,
that's the best place to cross.

403
00:41:34,911 --> 00:41:38,120
If you can find it.
But time is against you.

404
00:41:38,511 --> 00:41:41,321
In three days,
nobody will be where they are today.

405
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:43,891
Shall we?

406
00:41:43,991 --> 00:41:46,211
No, it's better if you don't.

407
00:41:46,311 --> 00:41:48,279
Something happens in that room,

408
00:41:50,311 --> 00:41:52,200
it's easier to say you didn't see anything.

409
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:56,379
It's great to see you're still in the fight.

410
00:41:57,172 --> 00:42:00,091
I'm sorry for what happened to you.

411
00:42:02,844 --> 00:42:03,929
Take care.

412
00:43:01,191 --> 00:43:03,922
Alejandro, I think he remembers you.

413
00:43:05,431 --> 00:43:07,011
I'm gonna step out.

414
00:43:07,111 --> 00:43:08,442
Timmy.

415
00:43:17,836 --> 00:43:21,756
Now you'll learn what's hell in Yankee Land.

416
00:43:22,632 --> 00:43:23,800
No, Medellin.

417
00:43:31,351 --> 00:43:33,479
What do you keep lookin' at me for?

418
00:43:34,231 --> 00:43:36,313
<i>No hablo Inglés,</i> remember?

419
00:43:39,151 --> 00:43:40,801
No, no.

420
00:44:03,551 --> 00:44:05,041
Can I have one of those?

421
00:44:05,791 --> 00:44:07,031
Thank you.

422
00:44:27,391 --> 00:44:29,155
- You like fireworks?
- Huh?

423
00:44:29,551 --> 00:44:31,201
Wanna see something cool?

424
00:44:31,671 --> 00:44:32,911
Come on.

425
00:45:07,991 --> 00:45:09,038
Here we go.

426
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:14,722
Look right there.

427
00:45:30,711 --> 00:45:32,076
Unbelievable.

428
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:34,971
That's what happens
when you chop the head off a chicken.

429
00:45:35,071 --> 00:45:36,755
Yeah.

430
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,641
I can see.

431
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,331
Can you get 'em all in one place?

432
00:45:43,431 --> 00:45:46,435
We just landed back in Phoenix.
I'm on a clock, I can't wait.

433
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:49,291
All right, look, contact Bob Fisks.

434
00:45:49,391 --> 00:45:51,171
Have him hold 'em in the staging area.

435
00:45:51,271 --> 00:45:53,371
Yeah. How long does it
take to get to Tucson?

436
00:45:53,471 --> 00:45:55,411
Um, from here
it's a little over two hours.

437
00:45:55,511 --> 00:45:58,355
All right.
We'll be there around 2:00. Yeah.

438
00:46:00,471 --> 00:46:01,851
Are we going to Tucson?

439
00:46:01,951 --> 00:46:04,091
Yeah, you gotta learn
how to sleep on a plane.

440
00:46:04,191 --> 00:46:06,971
They let me on the base
when you need a ride, don't they?

441
00:46:07,071 --> 00:46:08,051
You okay?

442
00:46:08,151 --> 00:46:09,691
- She's fine.
- I didn't ask you.

443
00:46:09,791 --> 00:46:11,281
And yet I answered.

444
00:46:14,751 --> 00:46:15,957
Kate,

445
00:46:16,351 --> 00:46:17,398
who's that?

446
00:46:18,551 --> 00:46:20,315
We're goin' to Tucson.

447
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,891
What's the deal, Matt?
Why you holdin' up my transport?

448
00:46:57,991 --> 00:46:59,281
Don't worry, Bob. We'll be quick.

449
00:46:59,351 --> 00:47:00,931
How's the auditor gonna react to

450
00:47:01,031 --> 00:47:03,771
an $8,000 check to fuckin' Domino's Pizza?

451
00:47:03,871 --> 00:47:06,522
Don't be so dramatic, okay?
This is Kate Macer with the FBI.

452
00:47:06,631 --> 00:47:08,401
This is her partner, what's-his-name.
It was her call.

453
00:47:08,471 --> 00:47:11,520
Yeah, it wasn't my call.
Have you got another one of those?

454
00:47:18,671 --> 00:47:20,331
Finish it before you get up there.

455
00:47:20,431 --> 00:47:21,717
No problem.

456
00:47:23,671 --> 00:47:24,877
Hey, Kate.

457
00:47:25,751 --> 00:47:27,719
Tell me what happened in El Paso.

458
00:47:28,071 --> 00:47:31,393
We weren't in El Paso. We were in Mexico.

459
00:48:22,551 --> 00:48:24,731
I guess we're not
following any procedures.

460
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,162
What do you wanna do?

461
00:48:26,271 --> 00:48:29,718
We want to talk to the people
caught around the Nogales area.

462
00:48:31,591 --> 00:48:34,720
Okay. That group.

463
00:48:37,191 --> 00:48:40,001
This group here. And that group.

464
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,997
Okay. They stay and the rest can go.

465
00:48:44,511 --> 00:48:45,922
Josef!

466
00:48:51,419 --> 00:48:55,089
Everyone from Nogales, groups A, D, E...

467
00:48:56,215 --> 00:48:58,926
Groups A, D, E...

468
00:48:59,052 --> 00:49:00,386
Stay seated.

469
00:49:00,511 --> 00:49:03,640
Everyone else to the buses.

470
00:49:04,515 --> 00:49:05,475
Now!

471
00:49:06,351 --> 00:49:08,115
On the bus. <i>Ándale.</i>

472
00:49:08,561 --> 00:49:09,562
Now!

473
00:49:26,631 --> 00:49:28,474
What are we looking for?

474
00:49:30,871 --> 00:49:32,396
Just keep watching.

475
00:49:36,339 --> 00:49:38,216
From this group here,

476
00:49:40,093 --> 00:49:42,762
who was been in the US before?

477
00:49:48,601 --> 00:49:49,894
Excuse me.

478
00:49:52,605 --> 00:49:53,564
Where?

479
00:49:54,031 --> 00:49:55,874
- In Arizona.
- Arizona.

480
00:49:56,943 --> 00:49:59,237
- Are you married?
- Yes, sir.

481
00:50:00,655 --> 00:50:01,781
Any children?

482
00:50:02,071 --> 00:50:03,072
<i>Sí.</i>

483
00:50:03,157 --> 00:50:05,368
- Where?
- Chihuahua.

484
00:50:06,035 --> 00:50:07,328
Let me see your hands.

485
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,268
- Do you have any tattoos?
- No, sir.

486
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:14,512
No?

487
00:50:15,878 --> 00:50:17,505
And you, what's your name?

488
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:18,631
Alejandro.

489
00:50:18,756 --> 00:50:20,133
Last name?

490
00:50:20,258 --> 00:50:21,884
Alejandro Rodriguez.

491
00:50:23,177 --> 00:50:24,512
And where have you been?

492
00:50:24,637 --> 00:50:25,638
In Texas.

493
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:29,976
And where have you been?

494
00:50:31,031 --> 00:50:32,840
- Arizona.
- Arizona...

495
00:50:36,831 --> 00:50:38,291
Talk to me. What are we doing?

496
00:50:38,391 --> 00:50:39,961
I don't have any answers for you.

497
00:50:40,071 --> 00:50:41,331
Let's get some, then.

498
00:50:41,431 --> 00:50:43,001
Do you think
I haven't asked these questions?

499
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,081
Do you think you can do better?

500
00:50:44,151 --> 00:50:45,131
- Yeah.
- Go ahead.

501
00:50:45,231 --> 00:50:47,154
Matt, can we talk for a minute?

502
00:50:58,271 --> 00:50:59,636
What's up?

503
00:51:00,711 --> 00:51:02,281
Everything okay?

504
00:51:03,711 --> 00:51:05,281
You look very serious.

505
00:51:05,551 --> 00:51:08,531
There's "in the dark"
and there's the way you're treating us.

506
00:51:08,631 --> 00:51:10,713
I want to know the objective
or I walk, period.

507
00:51:11,831 --> 00:51:14,914
Then go. I didn't ask you to be here.
She did.

508
00:51:15,191 --> 00:51:16,556
I walk, too.

509
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:28,131
- What do you wanna know?
- Everything.

510
00:51:28,231 --> 00:51:29,642
Fuckin' lawyers.

511
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,796
All right.

512
00:51:33,231 --> 00:51:34,471
Guillermo

513
00:51:36,311 --> 00:51:39,633
told us about a tunnel east of Nogales,
near Sasabe.

514
00:51:40,311 --> 00:51:43,691
Now we're tryin' to find out
what areas near there migrants avoid

515
00:51:43,791 --> 00:51:45,555
so we can find the tunnel.

516
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:48,691
That better?

517
00:51:48,791 --> 00:51:49,771
And Guillermo is...

518
00:51:49,871 --> 00:51:51,881
Guillermo, he just told you
where the drug tunnel is?

519
00:51:51,951 --> 00:51:52,971
He just told you?

520
00:51:53,071 --> 00:51:54,691
Guillermo didn't have any other options.

521
00:51:54,791 --> 00:51:56,851
We send him back across the border,
he's a dead man.

522
00:51:56,951 --> 00:52:00,000
Now he gets to spend the next 30 years
in an American prison,

523
00:52:01,431 --> 00:52:02,531
In relative safety.

524
00:52:02,631 --> 00:52:04,474
Just tell us the truth, man.

525
00:52:10,791 --> 00:52:13,192
We are gonna make enough noise

526
00:52:14,271 --> 00:52:17,753
that Manuel Diaz is called back
to Mexico to see his boss.

527
00:52:18,271 --> 00:52:19,691
That's the truth.

528
00:52:19,791 --> 00:52:21,077
And then?

529
00:52:21,591 --> 00:52:23,832
And then we know where his boss is.

530
00:52:25,951 --> 00:52:29,239
His name is Fausto Alarcon. <i>El Verdugo.</i>

531
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:36,201
Every day across that border,

532
00:52:36,311 --> 00:52:40,999
people are kidnapped or killed
by his hand or with his blessing.

533
00:52:43,631 --> 00:52:47,920
To find him would be like
discovering a vaccine.

534
00:52:51,031 --> 00:52:52,681
You understand the value of that.

535
00:52:57,871 --> 00:53:01,159
All right, we're good.
Just don't keep us in the dark.

536
00:53:01,471 --> 00:53:02,472
Great!

537
00:53:03,351 --> 00:53:05,240
You afraid of the dark?

538
00:53:08,631 --> 00:53:09,678
Hey!

539
00:53:10,231 --> 00:53:13,731
It's been a humdinger of a day.
Go home. Get some rest.

540
00:53:13,831 --> 00:53:16,562
We'll find our own ride.
We'll see you tomorrow!

541
00:53:16,991 --> 00:53:18,811
I just drove a hundred fucking miles.

542
00:53:18,911 --> 00:53:20,771
It's a fucking blessing, trust me.

543
00:53:20,871 --> 00:53:21,931
Got you smokin' again?

544
00:53:22,031 --> 00:53:23,032
Yeah.

545
00:53:24,711 --> 00:53:26,520
Who the fuck's Guillermo?

546
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:43,396
Come and eat.

547
00:54:43,521 --> 00:54:45,564
Let's get ready for school.

548
00:54:57,451 --> 00:54:58,703
Where's Dad?

549
00:54:59,537 --> 00:55:01,205
He's working.

550
00:55:06,127 --> 00:55:07,378
When's he back?

551
00:55:08,754 --> 00:55:09,588
Don't know.

552
00:55:21,831 --> 00:55:23,640
Gotta get you a new bra, woman.

553
00:55:25,031 --> 00:55:26,611
The list of things I need.

554
00:55:26,711 --> 00:55:28,793
I'm just saying, you know.
Some nice lacy somethin'.

555
00:55:29,391 --> 00:55:32,759
It's been a while since someone's
seen me in a bra, except you.

556
00:55:34,231 --> 00:55:36,962
Oh, God, don't look at me like that.
I don't want your pity.

557
00:55:37,071 --> 00:55:39,233
How was seeing Evan the other day?

558
00:55:40,231 --> 00:55:41,451
I don't know...

559
00:55:41,551 --> 00:55:43,394
- Miss him?
- Ask me something else.

560
00:55:48,951 --> 00:55:50,931
You know,
I used to see guys like Matt in Iraq.

561
00:55:51,031 --> 00:55:52,851
Gotta be careful around these people.

562
00:55:52,951 --> 00:55:55,491
CIA's not supposed to
work this side of the fence.

563
00:55:55,591 --> 00:55:56,971
He's a DOD advisor.

564
00:55:57,071 --> 00:55:58,641
You really believe that?

565
00:56:01,071 --> 00:56:03,891
You need somebody watching your six,
'cause I promise you they aren't.

566
00:56:03,991 --> 00:56:05,277
You know,

567
00:56:05,831 --> 00:56:09,836
we're not even scratching the surface
doing what we're doing.

568
00:56:10,311 --> 00:56:11,411
And they are.

569
00:56:11,511 --> 00:56:15,072
Well, you sure picked
the motherfuckers to show us.

570
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:33,796
What's the password?

571
00:56:35,031 --> 00:56:36,157
Moron.

572
00:56:43,891 --> 00:56:45,976
Los Caballeros, can you cross there?

573
00:56:46,102 --> 00:56:47,561
You can.

574
00:56:47,686 --> 00:56:50,898
But the coyotes there are crooked.

575
00:56:51,023 --> 00:56:53,442
No women can cross there.

576
00:56:56,031 --> 00:56:57,157
This is our spot.

577
00:56:57,351 --> 00:57:02,039
No way! No, no.

578
00:57:02,868 --> 00:57:04,370
This is drug land.

579
00:57:04,495 --> 00:57:09,500
The only people who cross there
are mules and pollos.

580
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:12,711
It keeps Border Patrol away.

581
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:14,922
Never cross where there are tunnels.

582
00:57:15,047 --> 00:57:16,507
You know this area?

583
00:57:16,632 --> 00:57:20,511
For years it was the best place to cross.

584
00:57:20,636 --> 00:57:24,557
Here you can walk easily to Highway 86.

585
00:57:24,932 --> 00:57:26,567
There is water and shade.

586
00:57:26,751 --> 00:57:28,491
Are you getting this?

587
00:57:28,561 --> 00:57:32,356
Can you mark the trail to the tunnel?

588
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:38,028
They hide the entrance behind an old car.

589
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:40,364
Look, right here.

590
00:57:41,951 --> 00:57:42,998
Yes.

591
00:57:46,351 --> 00:57:48,001
That's our way across.

592
00:57:49,231 --> 00:57:51,632
So Guillermo was tellin' the truth.

593
00:57:53,031 --> 00:57:54,795
It's gonna be a good day.

594
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:59,435
Hey, Kate.
Got any friends at Phoenix SWAT?

595
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:01,231
Yeah, we use them
in breaches all the time.

596
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,721
Good, 'cause we're gonna need their help.

597
00:58:02,791 --> 00:58:03,811
What for?

598
00:58:03,911 --> 00:58:07,074
We are gonna fuck with
Manuel Diaz's wallet.

599
00:58:58,791 --> 00:59:02,034
This is our Smurf, guys.
Blonde hair, white purse.

600
00:59:09,431 --> 00:59:11,371
- You know the Heimlich?
- Oh, yeah.

601
00:59:11,471 --> 00:59:14,481
She tries to eat that deposit receipt,
you Heimlich it right out of her, hear me?

602
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:15,791
Copy that.

603
00:59:19,831 --> 00:59:22,960
There she goes.
All right, go get 'em, tiger.

604
00:59:23,151 --> 00:59:24,232
Take 'em.

605
00:59:34,031 --> 00:59:35,317
<i>Get down!</i>

606
00:59:35,991 --> 00:59:37,834
<i>Hold Still! Hold Still!</i>

607
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:43,001
You want bank computers for evidence?

608
00:59:43,071 --> 00:59:44,811
No, no. Just the money.

609
00:59:44,911 --> 00:59:46,531
But freeze all his accounts, everything.

610
00:59:46,631 --> 00:59:49,032
Even if his dog opened an account,
I want you to freeze it.

611
00:59:54,951 --> 00:59:56,282
What you got?

612
00:59:58,311 --> 01:00:00,154
Got a mobile money launderer.

613
01:00:04,911 --> 01:00:05,992
Pack it up.

614
01:00:06,951 --> 01:00:08,794
Come on. Come on!

615
01:00:16,391 --> 01:00:17,491
You coming?

616
01:00:17,591 --> 01:00:18,611
No, don't go in the bank.

617
01:00:18,711 --> 01:00:20,671
This is something
we can actually build a case on.

618
01:00:20,751 --> 01:00:22,531
Don't go in the bank, Kate!

619
01:00:22,631 --> 01:00:24,360
There you go, and she's goin' in the bank.

620
01:00:41,631 --> 01:00:43,411
These are all Manuel Diaz's accounts?

621
01:00:43,511 --> 01:00:46,879
Yeah. Cash deposits made daily
in $9,000 increments.

622
01:00:47,151 --> 01:00:49,231
- So, it doesn't have to be reported.
- That's right.

623
01:00:49,311 --> 01:00:50,571
And you can seize those?

624
01:00:50,671 --> 01:00:53,931
I already have. And I'll go through
these wire transfer numbers and

625
01:00:54,031 --> 01:00:55,999
freeze all these accounts as well.

626
01:00:57,031 --> 01:00:58,112
Here you go.

627
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:03,841
- Oh, damn, that's smart.
- What?

628
01:01:04,751 --> 01:01:06,640
This is a bank line of credit.

629
01:01:07,511 --> 01:01:09,931
See, you make payments
over what you owe

630
01:01:10,031 --> 01:01:13,251
and it doesn't show up as cash,
it shows up as a negative loan balance.

631
01:01:13,351 --> 01:01:15,931
It's never reported to anyone. IRS, DEA...

632
01:01:16,031 --> 01:01:17,681
This money is invisible.

633
01:01:17,871 --> 01:01:19,111
How much does he have?

634
01:01:20,231 --> 01:01:21,357
Take a look.

635
01:01:24,671 --> 01:01:26,002
Oh, my God.

636
01:01:27,951 --> 01:01:30,771
They just seized $17 million.

637
01:01:30,871 --> 01:01:32,531
- It's a bogus bust, Kate.
- What?

638
01:01:32,631 --> 01:01:33,691
You can't prosecute it.

639
01:01:33,791 --> 01:01:35,641
No one controls who deposits
money in an account.

640
01:01:35,711 --> 01:01:37,441
An attorney will have that money back
in a few months,

641
01:01:37,511 --> 01:01:38,881
but a lot of heads will roll before that.

642
01:01:38,951 --> 01:01:41,571
But we can arrest Manuel for now.
We can get him off the street.

643
01:01:41,671 --> 01:01:44,531
We gotta get Manuel called back to Mexico.
That's the objective.

644
01:01:44,631 --> 01:01:46,360
We have no jurisdiction in Mexico.

645
01:01:46,631 --> 01:01:48,971
We have nothing.
We need to do something now.

646
01:01:49,071 --> 01:01:50,402
Can't arrest him.

647
01:02:08,911 --> 01:02:10,242
What?

648
01:02:11,391 --> 01:02:12,552
When?

649
01:02:15,191 --> 01:02:16,556
Wait a minute.

650
01:02:37,711 --> 01:02:41,811
$9,000 is deposited into this account
every day, in cash,

651
01:02:41,911 --> 01:02:43,072
for five years.

652
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:46,331
It's not illegal.
It's suspect, but it isn't illegal.

653
01:02:46,431 --> 01:02:48,251
I think the IRS might think it's illegal.

654
01:02:48,351 --> 01:02:50,241
What do you want, Kate?
What would you like done here?

655
01:02:50,311 --> 01:02:52,731
I want to follow
some semblance of procedure.

656
01:02:52,831 --> 01:02:54,971
That's what I want.
To build a prosecutable case.

657
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:58,451
We prosecuted more felony drug cases
in this region last year

658
01:02:58,551 --> 01:03:01,157
than in the two previous years combined.

659
01:03:01,271 --> 01:03:03,592
Are you feeling that on the street?

660
01:03:04,311 --> 01:03:06,632
You getting the vibe that we're winning?

661
01:03:09,591 --> 01:03:11,251
No.

662
01:03:11,351 --> 01:03:12,921
Do you?

663
01:03:13,431 --> 01:03:14,876
No, sir, I don't.

664
01:03:17,271 --> 01:03:20,051
Advisors like Matt come in,
they stir the pot,

665
01:03:20,151 --> 01:03:22,802
they cause the criminals
to react and make mistakes.

666
01:03:22,991 --> 01:03:25,331
That's how we build cases
against the individuals

667
01:03:25,431 --> 01:03:27,513
that actually make a
difference in this fight.

668
01:03:27,791 --> 01:03:30,811
It's when they're nervous,
when they stop trusting their crews,

669
01:03:30,911 --> 01:03:32,851
when they move their money.

670
01:03:32,951 --> 01:03:34,840
These are all opportunities to strike.

671
01:03:35,831 --> 01:03:38,072
And that's the purpose of people like Matt.

672
01:03:38,191 --> 01:03:41,354
Kate, this isn't something
that I dreamed up myself.

673
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:44,891
I don't have the authority to hire advisors

674
01:03:44,991 --> 01:03:47,611
or authorize joint agency missions,

675
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:50,237
or fly agents from Air Force bases.

676
01:03:51,311 --> 01:03:53,451
Are you understanding me?

677
01:03:53,551 --> 01:03:56,634
These decisions are made far from here

678
01:03:57,191 --> 01:04:00,752
by officials elected to office,
not appointed to them.

679
01:04:01,991 --> 01:04:04,891
So if your fear is operating out of bounds,

680
01:04:04,991 --> 01:04:08,040
I am telling you, you are not.

681
01:04:09,671 --> 01:04:11,594
The boundary's been moved.

682
01:04:13,471 --> 01:04:14,882
Are we clear?

683
01:04:16,151 --> 01:04:17,641
Yes, sir.

684
01:04:20,791 --> 01:04:22,411
I need a fucking drink.

685
01:04:22,511 --> 01:04:24,718
- Where you wanna go?
- Anywhere.

686
01:05:00,991 --> 01:05:02,091
I'm gonna go get a table.

687
01:05:02,191 --> 01:05:04,080
- I guess it's on me.
- Thanks.

688
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:09,239
- What'll it be?
- Two beers.

689
01:05:30,511 --> 01:05:31,672
Thank you.

690
01:05:47,511 --> 01:05:49,559
I want a cigarette so bad.

691
01:05:55,191 --> 01:05:56,920
Macer?

692
01:05:57,351 --> 01:05:58,921
Yeah?

693
01:05:59,031 --> 01:06:01,159
I hate to go on about this,

694
01:06:02,151 --> 01:06:04,611
but I think the bra situation's
the least of your problems.

695
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:05,758
Okay...

696
01:06:05,871 --> 01:06:07,714
'Cause you look like shit.

697
01:06:07,831 --> 01:06:10,880
You do. You look like shit.
Everybody on the team's talkin' about it.

698
01:06:10,991 --> 01:06:13,371
They're like, "Kate used to be
a number one draft pick.

699
01:06:13,471 --> 01:06:15,311
"Now look at her.
She looks like fuckin' shit."

700
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:17,291
Look at you. Your eyebrows are a mess.

701
01:06:17,391 --> 01:06:18,531
No, they're not!

702
01:06:18,631 --> 01:06:21,121
They're like caterpillars, like wild beasts.
You're losing weight...

703
01:06:21,191 --> 01:06:22,171
I'm eating.

704
01:06:22,271 --> 01:06:24,411
Look at you.
What is it, one T-shirt a week?

705
01:06:24,511 --> 01:06:27,051
At least work
on your personal hygiene, huh?

706
01:06:27,151 --> 01:06:28,198
You sound like my mother.

707
01:06:28,311 --> 01:06:29,676
Maybe I am your mother.

708
01:06:30,471 --> 01:06:33,691
First we work on personal hygiene,
then we move on to the shopping.

709
01:06:33,791 --> 01:06:36,491
Get you some potatoes, yeah?
Eat some food...

710
01:06:36,591 --> 01:06:38,593
Where have you taken me?
What is this place?

711
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:40,917
It's a bar.

712
01:06:41,031 --> 01:06:42,237
It's full of cowboys.

713
01:06:42,751 --> 01:06:43,991
I'm a cowboy.

714
01:06:44,111 --> 01:06:45,171
You're a redneck?

715
01:06:45,271 --> 01:06:48,851
I'm a redneck. Got a trailer. Got a wife.

716
01:06:48,951 --> 01:06:50,091
What are you talking about?

717
01:06:50,191 --> 01:06:52,034
I got a trailer, I got a wife.
She's my sister.

718
01:06:53,911 --> 01:06:54,992
Big Reg.

719
01:06:55,271 --> 01:06:57,051
- Ted!
- What's goin' on, man?

720
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:59,161
- Long time. How you been?
- Yeah, it's good to see you, man.

721
01:06:59,231 --> 01:07:00,401
Good to see you, too.
How you been?

722
01:07:00,471 --> 01:07:01,611
Gettin' your groove on, huh?

723
01:07:01,711 --> 01:07:03,241
No, man. We just started. We just got here.

724
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:04,891
All right. You...

725
01:07:04,991 --> 01:07:06,451
- Gonna introduce me, man?
-

726
01:07:06,551 --> 01:07:08,571
Ted, Phoenix PD, Kate, my partner.

727
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,911
How you doin'? Just Ted's fine.

728
01:07:09,991 --> 01:07:11,971
I saw you play softball once.

729
01:07:12,071 --> 01:07:13,880
Softball?

730
01:07:14,191 --> 01:07:15,891
She was at the game, Ted.

731
01:07:15,991 --> 01:07:17,231
"The game?"

732
01:07:18,391 --> 01:07:20,041
Where you struck out
in slow-pitch softball.

733
01:07:20,111 --> 01:07:21,651
You played really, really well.

734
01:07:21,751 --> 01:07:22,798
Yeah, I appreciate that.

735
01:07:22,911 --> 01:07:26,632
I'm gonna head back to that bar now.
Well, can I get y'all another round?

736
01:07:26,991 --> 01:07:28,117
- Yeah, sure.
- Cool.

737
01:07:28,311 --> 01:07:29,358
All right.

738
01:07:31,511 --> 01:07:32,876
Ted, he's a good guy.

739
01:07:35,871 --> 01:07:37,202
Divorced.

740
01:08:53,031 --> 01:08:55,113
Just give me one second,
I'll be right with you.

741
01:08:58,151 --> 01:08:59,277
All right...

742
01:09:19,751 --> 01:09:21,171
Just wait, wait, wait a second...

743
01:09:21,271 --> 01:09:23,291
What, what, what? Is that too much?

744
01:09:23,391 --> 01:09:25,291
Just wait one minute.
I just need a second.

745
01:09:25,391 --> 01:09:27,439
All right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

746
01:09:35,071 --> 01:09:36,331
Hey, Kate?

747
01:09:36,431 --> 01:09:39,992
Hey! Hey, come here, stop, stop, talk to me.

748
01:09:40,191 --> 01:09:43,971
Just talk to me. Okay?
Relax. Okay? Just take it...

749
01:09:44,071 --> 01:09:46,073
Shit! Kate...

750
01:09:47,231 --> 01:09:50,075
What is it? What? Stop.

751
01:09:50,271 --> 01:09:52,160
Stop. Stop.

752
01:09:52,591 --> 01:09:54,355
Shit, what the fuck is wrong with you?

753
01:09:56,031 --> 01:09:57,874
- Don't...
- What the fuck are you...

754
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:00,515
Goddamn!

755
01:10:02,511 --> 01:10:04,718
You fuckin' try to shoot me?
You fuckin' crazy?

756
01:10:07,151 --> 01:10:08,596
- Stop that!
- Get off me!

757
01:10:11,271 --> 01:10:12,318
Fuck that...

758
01:10:13,271 --> 01:10:15,194
Damn it, Kate! Just fucking stop!

759
01:10:17,671 --> 01:10:18,672
Stop!

760
01:10:21,911 --> 01:10:25,996
Stop, bitch! Stop! Fuck!

761
01:10:27,831 --> 01:10:29,674
Fuckin' stop!

762
01:10:32,751 --> 01:10:34,594
Stop.

763
01:10:37,591 --> 01:10:38,638
Fuck!

764
01:10:41,791 --> 01:10:45,796
This is you, you hear me?
You did this. You did this.

765
01:11:00,551 --> 01:11:01,632
Psst!

766
01:11:21,671 --> 01:11:23,435
You used me as bait.

767
01:11:24,631 --> 01:11:27,077
Nah, you used yourself as bait.

768
01:11:27,191 --> 01:11:28,920
I told you not to go in the bank.

769
01:11:32,631 --> 01:11:35,651
You brought him back here, though.
That was smart.

770
01:11:35,751 --> 01:11:38,571
Yeah. Love how we're gonna
pretend like I planned this.

771
01:11:38,671 --> 01:11:41,531
Why don't you just write
that in your report.

772
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:43,679
Come on! This is good news!

773
01:11:44,871 --> 01:11:47,158
They're gonna call Manuel back soon.

774
01:11:48,311 --> 01:11:49,961
Isn't that the point?

775
01:12:03,791 --> 01:12:05,361
It's okay, Reg.

776
01:12:08,911 --> 01:12:10,131
I thought he was a friend.

777
01:12:10,231 --> 01:12:11,392
I know.

778
01:12:15,471 --> 01:12:18,202
- Want me to stay tonight?
- No. I'm good.

779
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:20,115
- You sure?
- I'm good.

780
01:12:23,271 --> 01:12:27,196
How y'all want me to talk to you
when you keep fuckin' hittin' me?

781
01:12:27,911 --> 01:12:32,131
How many other corrupt motherfuckers are
you workin' with on this side of the border?

782
01:12:32,231 --> 01:12:34,438
All right. Look...

783
01:12:35,951 --> 01:12:38,636
It's exactly what I told you, all right?
They just...

784
01:12:40,511 --> 01:12:43,571
They came to me
and they wanted details about our case

785
01:12:43,671 --> 01:12:47,118
and, yes, I did it. I gave it to them,
but I never wanted anybody to get hurt.

786
01:12:47,231 --> 01:12:49,001
I would never gotten involved
with them pieces of shit

787
01:12:49,071 --> 01:12:50,121
if I thought that there was any...

788
01:12:50,191 --> 01:12:52,691
Fuck! Okay!

789
01:12:52,791 --> 01:12:54,793
Okay! Fuck! Okay!

790
01:12:56,071 --> 01:12:59,553
"Okay, okay, okay,"
is not what we're lookin' for, Ted.

791
01:13:01,591 --> 01:13:04,515
You know what the beauty is
of you being so beat to a pulp?

792
01:13:05,871 --> 01:13:08,238
'Cause no one's gonna notice
a few more scratches.

793
01:13:09,591 --> 01:13:11,161
This is a new deal, Ted.

794
01:13:13,871 --> 01:13:17,571
I'm the one who decides whether
your daughter'll get Federal protection...

795
01:13:17,671 --> 01:13:18,731
Fuck...

796
01:13:18,831 --> 01:13:21,914
Or whether we post your ex-wife's
address on the Internet.

797
01:13:23,471 --> 01:13:28,238
I decide whether you go to prison
in a work camp in Missouri,

798
01:13:29,551 --> 01:13:30,996
or a kill house like Corcoran.

799
01:13:32,271 --> 01:13:33,477
All right.

800
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:36,716
This is where you negotiate
how to survive, my friend.

801
01:13:39,431 --> 01:13:41,798
Okay. Look...

802
01:13:44,551 --> 01:13:46,838
I feel like this whole thing's
just gotten away from me...

803
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:52,353
I fucked up. Okay, I fucked up
and I'm in over my fuckin' head right now.

804
01:13:53,231 --> 01:13:54,371
I'm sorry...

805
01:13:54,471 --> 01:13:57,281
Fuck! Get it out! Get it the fuck out!

806
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:02,632
Fuck! Get it the fuck out! Get it out!

807
01:14:02,911 --> 01:14:05,232
Motherfucker! And fuck you!

808
01:14:05,791 --> 01:14:06,792
Fuck!

809
01:14:08,351 --> 01:14:11,082
How many officers
do they have working on the force?

810
01:14:13,391 --> 01:14:15,211
I'll tell you everything you wanna know.

811
01:14:15,311 --> 01:14:18,691
You just gotta promise me that
my daughter's gonna be safe, okay?

812
01:14:18,791 --> 01:14:20,714
You make me that promise.

813
01:14:21,031 --> 01:14:22,476
You want the truth?

814
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:23,997
Please.

815
01:14:28,311 --> 01:14:31,042
Give me all the names

816
01:14:32,071 --> 01:14:34,836
of all the motherfuckers
they got working on the force.

817
01:14:35,031 --> 01:14:36,331
Okay, okay...

818
01:14:36,431 --> 01:14:37,956
- All right?
- Okay...

819
01:14:39,551 --> 01:14:41,679
Okay. So which phone do we start with?

820
01:14:41,911 --> 01:14:43,361
It's in that one. It's that shitty one.

821
01:14:43,431 --> 01:14:45,433
- That's the shitty one?
- Yes, sir!

822
01:15:01,831 --> 01:15:03,321
How you feelin'?

823
01:15:05,951 --> 01:15:07,953
Better.

824
01:15:09,111 --> 01:15:12,593
Well, you should've shot him.

825
01:15:20,671 --> 01:15:23,356
I just tried to have sex with my hitman.

826
01:15:24,791 --> 01:15:27,112
Nah. He's no assassin.

827
01:15:28,071 --> 01:15:30,491
He just wanted to know what you know.

828
01:15:30,591 --> 01:15:33,117
They're after us, not you.

829
01:15:38,271 --> 01:15:39,602
Thank you.

830
01:15:53,631 --> 01:15:56,237
You remind me of someone
very special to me.

831
01:16:05,711 --> 01:16:07,201
Get some rest.

832
01:16:08,711 --> 01:16:11,476
Tomorrow they'll call Manuel Diaz
back to Mexico

833
01:16:12,391 --> 01:16:14,439
and we'll cut a leg from them.

834
01:16:49,551 --> 01:16:50,711
<i>Hello, sixty.</i>

835
01:17:00,471 --> 01:17:02,811
<i>We have eyes on the objective.</i>

836
01:17:02,911 --> 01:17:04,561
<i>Can we get a closer visual?</i>

837
01:17:09,431 --> 01:17:11,911
<i>Ten meters going down east of the ridge.</i>

838
01:17:16,951 --> 01:17:17,998
Papa?

839
01:17:22,337 --> 01:17:23,254
Eggs.

840
01:17:25,965 --> 01:17:26,966
With jalapefios?

841
01:17:27,091 --> 01:17:28,134
Of course.

842
01:17:36,976 --> 01:17:38,561
Are you working today?

843
01:17:41,939 --> 01:17:42,982
Tonight.

844
01:17:44,650 --> 01:17:47,320
Do you want to play soccer in the park?

845
01:17:50,471 --> 01:17:52,314
- Football?
<i>- Sí,</i> Papa.

846
01:17:54,035 --> 01:17:55,620
Hand me my coffee.

847
01:18:03,002 --> 01:18:04,504
Alright, we'll play.

848
01:18:10,591 --> 01:18:11,638
No!

849
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:15,181
Never touch that!

850
01:18:16,974 --> 01:18:17,934
Understood?

851
01:18:39,031 --> 01:18:40,091
Come on in.

852
01:18:40,191 --> 01:18:41,397
Tasty beverage?

853
01:18:43,831 --> 01:18:44,878
Okay, boys.

854
01:18:47,031 --> 01:18:48,321
What's going on? What's the plan?

855
01:18:48,391 --> 01:18:49,722
We're going hunting.

856
01:18:50,791 --> 01:18:53,571
Looks like Manuel Diaz
is being called back to Mexico.

857
01:18:53,671 --> 01:18:55,400
Just waiting for confirmation.

858
01:18:56,791 --> 01:18:58,122
There's the tunnel right there.

859
01:18:59,111 --> 01:19:00,471
All right, listen up.

860
01:19:00,991 --> 01:19:02,436
Let's clarify the op.

861
01:19:03,111 --> 01:19:04,761
We're gonna drive to location,
proceed on foot...

862
01:19:04,831 --> 01:19:06,611
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

863
01:19:06,711 --> 01:19:08,634
- I'm fine.
- How's the neck?

864
01:19:08,871 --> 01:19:10,111
It's better, thank you.

865
01:19:10,351 --> 01:19:11,876
Good, good.

866
01:19:12,071 --> 01:19:13,331
These diagrams are based on

867
01:19:13,431 --> 01:19:14,841
other tunnels that have been mapped.

868
01:19:14,911 --> 01:19:16,831
They're for reference only,
they're not accurate.

869
01:19:17,311 --> 01:19:20,997
Once on the Mexican side of the border,
there'll be a small staging area,

870
01:19:21,191 --> 01:19:23,211
then another shaft
will lead to the main warehouse

871
01:19:23,311 --> 01:19:24,995
and the road that returns to Mexico.

872
01:19:25,711 --> 01:19:28,954
Once we clear the mules,
we don't expect more than a dozen bandits.

873
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:32,091
No. They use Mexican police
for vehicle transport.

874
01:19:32,191 --> 01:19:35,035
If you see a uniform in the tunnel,
consider him a bandit, too.

875
01:19:35,591 --> 01:19:38,913
Okay. You want to discuss ROE?

876
01:19:39,591 --> 01:19:40,891
Nah, we'll save that for later.

877
01:19:40,991 --> 01:19:41,992
Okay.

878
01:19:42,911 --> 01:19:46,074
This is an in and out.
We're clearing, placing an agent.

879
01:19:46,591 --> 01:19:48,171
It's all about creating a diversion.

880
01:19:48,271 --> 01:19:50,411
Want the mother
of all diversions, boys.

881
01:19:50,511 --> 01:19:53,401
Need a lot of noise.
Fourth of July on steroids.

882
01:19:54,551 --> 01:19:57,634
All right.
Weapons check. Let's go, boys.

883
01:20:02,271 --> 01:20:04,000
This looks like confirmation.

884
01:20:13,271 --> 01:20:15,571
- I need to fit your guy with a locator.
- Yeah, do it.

885
01:20:15,671 --> 01:20:17,891
Those are Special Ops.
Are we going in on this?

886
01:20:17,991 --> 01:20:19,601
Nah. You guys aren't really dressed for it.

887
01:20:19,671 --> 01:20:20,761
Well, you didn't fuckin' tell us.

888
01:20:20,831 --> 01:20:22,801
Yeah, well, you two went
cryin' to Daddy yesterday, and we

889
01:20:22,871 --> 01:20:24,841
- don't want Daddy to know everything.
- Oh, give me a fucking break!

890
01:20:24,911 --> 01:20:26,201
All right, we'll get you some extra gear.

891
01:20:26,271 --> 01:20:27,611
We have tac gear in the car.

892
01:20:27,711 --> 01:20:28,691
All right. Good.

893
01:20:28,791 --> 01:20:30,201
You guys will hang back
when we get there, okay?

894
01:20:30,271 --> 01:20:31,352
Then why are we going?

895
01:20:31,751 --> 01:20:34,411
'Cause CIA can't operate
within US borders...

896
01:20:34,511 --> 01:20:36,991
Without a domestic agency attached.

897
01:20:40,191 --> 01:20:41,955
I told you you'd be useful.

898
01:20:42,471 --> 01:20:44,599
So that's it. That's why I'm here.

899
01:20:46,311 --> 01:20:47,915
Yeah, that's it.

900
01:20:48,671 --> 01:20:50,196
That's why you're here.

901
01:20:51,271 --> 01:20:53,922
Hey, we find any drugs,
you guys get to confiscate 'em.

902
01:20:54,111 --> 01:20:55,681
It's gonna be a big day.

903
01:20:58,631 --> 01:21:00,076
Un-fucking real!

904
01:21:08,271 --> 01:21:09,921
- Front and back.
- Kate.

905
01:21:10,031 --> 01:21:13,451
Kate, come on. Fuck these people, man.
They've been using us from the beginning.

906
01:21:13,551 --> 01:21:14,691
We don't have to do this.

907
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:16,161
I need to know what they used us for.

908
01:21:16,231 --> 01:21:18,154
- Doesn't matter what!
- Yes, it does!

909
01:21:19,071 --> 01:21:22,851
I say we walk. We walk and make them
eat this whole fucked-up operation.

910
01:21:22,951 --> 01:21:24,282
No. I have to know.

911
01:21:33,391 --> 01:21:36,731
<i>Black Mercedes...
Plate number, Romeo-India-November</i>

912
01:21:36,831 --> 01:21:41,041
<i>three-one-Bravo-seven.
Heading south by southeast.</i>

913
01:22:53,791 --> 01:22:54,872
<i>Where?</i>

914
01:22:56,431 --> 01:22:58,531
Okay.

915
01:22:58,631 --> 01:23:01,157
We gotta hit the tunnel
the minute we get on the ground.

916
01:23:02,591 --> 01:23:04,036
Pretty exciting, huh?

917
01:23:16,751 --> 01:23:18,116
What is target's location?

918
01:23:18,351 --> 01:23:21,798
<i>14 miles south of Nogales
heading west, rapidly.</i>

919
01:23:32,791 --> 01:23:35,840
Keep your fuckin' safeties on,
barrels pointed down.

920
01:23:36,671 --> 01:23:37,832
Stay in the back.

921
01:23:38,591 --> 01:23:41,561
Don't shoot anyone
on my fuckin' team. Right?

922
01:24:14,351 --> 01:24:15,876
Gear check?

923
01:24:18,471 --> 01:24:20,251
Thermal camera, check.

924
01:24:20,351 --> 01:24:21,891
Night vision goggles, check.

925
01:24:21,991 --> 01:24:23,531
Get those guys.

926
01:24:23,631 --> 01:24:25,161
Wanna take Alpha squad, I'll take B squad?

927
01:24:25,231 --> 01:24:27,512
- You got it. Let's do it.
- Let's go, boys.

928
01:24:36,471 --> 01:24:38,473
Control, you copy?

929
01:24:39,311 --> 01:24:41,962
<i>Roger, Alpha. We read.</i>

930
01:26:23,911 --> 01:26:26,801
<i>Fifty meters.
Your three o'clock, Alpha.</i>

931
01:26:42,911 --> 01:26:45,391
<i>Stand by. Getting close to objective.</i>

932
01:26:53,911 --> 01:26:55,651
<i>Alpha, Bravo, be advised.</i>

933
01:26:55,751 --> 01:26:57,640
<i>12 meters straight ahead.</i>

934
01:27:20,191 --> 01:27:21,411
All right, we need to boogie

935
01:27:21,511 --> 01:27:24,276
and we need to do it quiet
till we find the center.

936
01:27:24,471 --> 01:27:26,851
Draw the fighters to you
and make some noise.

937
01:27:26,951 --> 01:27:28,999
Don't follow me. I'll be fine.

938
01:27:29,711 --> 01:27:31,918
What are the rules of engagement?

939
01:27:32,431 --> 01:27:35,674
Weapons free, my friend.
Weapons free.

940
01:27:37,031 --> 01:27:38,351
Weapons free, boys.

941
01:27:38,711 --> 01:27:40,156
Good luck.

942
01:28:28,031 --> 01:28:29,192
Oh, God!

943
01:30:54,791 --> 01:30:56,202
- You okay?
- My gun!

944
01:30:56,551 --> 01:30:58,360
Leave it. Stay on my six.

945
01:31:22,801 --> 01:31:23,594
Hurry UP!

946
01:31:26,263 --> 01:31:27,222
Help me out!

947
01:31:27,347 --> 01:31:28,682
Let's get out of here!

948
01:31:28,807 --> 01:31:29,641
Come on!

949
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:38,483
Let's go.
Give me the keys!

950
01:31:38,984 --> 01:31:41,695
- Give me the keys!
- Calm down!

951
01:31:43,071 --> 01:31:44,072
Hands in the air.

952
01:31:44,823 --> 01:31:45,824
Turn around.

953
01:31:51,705 --> 01:31:52,706
Medellin?

954
01:31:53,791 --> 01:31:54,872
Freeze!

955
01:31:56,991 --> 01:31:58,451
Step away from him.

956
01:31:58,551 --> 01:31:59,691
Put that down.

957
01:31:59,791 --> 01:32:01,680
I mean it! Move away from him right now!

958
01:32:08,871 --> 01:32:10,873
Don't ever point a weapon at me again.

959
01:32:12,151 --> 01:32:14,472
Catch your breath. Then get back up there.

960
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:42,256
Both hands on the steering wheel.

961
01:32:46,951 --> 01:32:49,761
I am through. Do you have my location?

962
01:32:50,271 --> 01:32:51,931
<i>Roger, we have you.</i>

963
01:32:52,031 --> 01:32:53,931
<i>Target is east and north of you.</i>

964
01:32:54,031 --> 01:32:58,480
<i>Looks like Highway 56 to 17.
Will intercept him if he stays on 17.</i>

965
01:32:58,911 --> 01:33:00,913
<i>Go east on 56 off Highway 2.</i>

966
01:33:01,551 --> 01:33:02,712
Wilco.

967
01:33:05,404 --> 01:33:06,697
What's your name?

968
01:33:07,281 --> 01:33:08,156
Silvio.

969
01:33:08,949 --> 01:33:12,077
You're going to exit onto Highway 56.

970
01:33:14,121 --> 01:33:15,247
I have a son.

971
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:19,710
What you do now is for you family.

972
01:33:22,271 --> 01:33:23,851
Is he through yet?

973
01:33:23,951 --> 01:33:27,672
<i>We have joy.
GPS is transmitting. Audio is transmitting.</i>

974
01:33:27,951 --> 01:33:29,555
<i>Should intercept in 20.</i>

975
01:33:30,991 --> 01:33:33,801
That was a clean,
clean fucking op, my friend.

976
01:33:33,951 --> 01:33:35,953
Except for these two assholes.

977
01:33:36,191 --> 01:33:38,201
Well, you're better overseas.
You don't have to babysit.

978
01:33:38,271 --> 01:33:39,272
Where's Kate?

979
01:33:40,231 --> 01:33:41,471
I thought she was with you.

980
01:33:42,791 --> 01:33:43,872
We gotta go back.

981
01:33:44,471 --> 01:33:47,156
Oh, shit. Boys, we're missin' one.
Let's go.

982
01:33:55,471 --> 01:33:56,472
Hey!

983
01:34:03,031 --> 01:34:05,477
Just lay back, baby. Let it happen.

984
01:34:10,991 --> 01:34:12,402
Stop. Stop moving.

985
01:34:12,671 --> 01:34:14,491
Get off me!

986
01:34:14,591 --> 01:34:16,241
Stop moving! Stop!

987
01:34:20,831 --> 01:34:21,992
Stop it.

988
01:34:22,991 --> 01:34:25,392
Just relax. Just relax.

989
01:34:27,591 --> 01:34:29,731
All right? You gonna stay there?

990
01:34:29,831 --> 01:34:31,515
Are you gonna stay there?

991
01:34:45,911 --> 01:34:46,958
All right.

992
01:34:49,071 --> 01:34:50,561
Now, you listen.

993
01:34:55,071 --> 01:34:57,039
You went up the wrong tunnel.

994
01:35:00,791 --> 01:35:03,192
You saw things you shouldn't have seen.

995
01:35:07,711 --> 01:35:09,361
What is Medellín?

996
01:35:10,271 --> 01:35:11,796
Medellín?

997
01:35:16,431 --> 01:35:18,593
Medellín refers to a time

998
01:35:20,071 --> 01:35:23,234
when one group controlled
every aspect of the drug trade,

999
01:35:24,911 --> 01:35:27,676
providing a measure of order
that we could control.

1000
01:35:29,591 --> 01:35:34,518
And until somebody finds a way
to convince 20% of the population

1001
01:35:34,751 --> 01:35:37,072
to stop snorting and smoking that shit,

1002
01:35:39,751 --> 01:35:41,833
Order's the best we can hope for.

1003
01:35:44,751 --> 01:35:46,811
And what you saw up there

1004
01:35:46,911 --> 01:35:50,154
was Alejandro working toward
returning that order.

1005
01:35:53,151 --> 01:35:56,598
Alejandro works for
the fucking Colombian Cartel.

1006
01:36:00,591 --> 01:36:02,514
He works for the competition.

1007
01:36:02,791 --> 01:36:05,317
Alejandro works for anyone

1008
01:36:05,511 --> 01:36:07,991
who will point him toward
the people who made him.

1009
01:36:10,711 --> 01:36:12,531
Us.

1010
01:36:12,631 --> 01:36:13,837
Them.

1011
01:36:15,111 --> 01:36:17,432
Anyone who will turn him loose.

1012
01:36:18,831 --> 01:36:23,553
So he can get the person
that cut off his wife's head,

1013
01:36:25,351 --> 01:36:28,195
and threw his daughter into a vat of acid.

1014
01:36:32,151 --> 01:36:33,277
Yeah.

1015
01:36:35,791 --> 01:36:37,793
That's what we're dealing with.

1016
01:36:42,311 --> 01:36:44,040
You can't do this.

1017
01:36:46,471 --> 01:36:47,836
You can't.

1018
01:36:49,871 --> 01:36:54,051
I'm sure as shit not the person
you're gonna hide it all behind.

1019
01:36:54,151 --> 01:36:55,571
You need to just take a breath.

1020
01:36:55,671 --> 01:36:57,051
I'm gonna fuckin' talk.

1021
01:36:57,151 --> 01:36:58,915
- No, you're not.
- Yeah.

1022
01:37:04,071 --> 01:37:06,517
I'm gonna tell everyone what you did.

1023
01:37:11,551 --> 01:37:13,792
That would be a major mistake.

1024
01:37:39,191 --> 01:37:41,432
Is that the target up ahead? Confirm.

1025
01:37:43,791 --> 01:37:47,796
<i>Roger that.
Black Mercedes, 60 meters ahead.</i>

1026
01:37:51,648 --> 01:37:52,816
Accelerate.

1027
01:37:55,777 --> 01:37:57,571
Turn on your lights.

1028
01:37:58,363 --> 01:38:00,991
You're going to pull over that car.

1029
01:38:11,111 --> 01:38:12,442
This motherfucker...

1030
01:38:21,803 --> 01:38:22,804
Very good.

1031
01:38:45,201 --> 01:38:46,578
Use the speaker.

1032
01:38:47,037 --> 01:38:48,830
Tell him to get out of the car.

1033
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:53,668
Leave the car.

1034
01:39:05,221 --> 01:39:06,097
Again.

1035
01:39:07,932 --> 01:39:09,517
Get out, asshole!

1036
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:19,986
Tell him to raise his jacket and turn around.

1037
01:39:20,570 --> 01:39:22,864
Raise your jacket and turn around.

1038
01:39:24,449 --> 01:39:25,867
You know who I am?

1039
01:39:27,118 --> 01:39:29,245
Tell him you'll kill him if he doesn't.

1040
01:39:29,371 --> 01:39:31,247
I'll kill you, motherfucker!

1041
01:39:32,248 --> 01:39:34,876
Raise your jacket and turn around.

1042
01:39:38,338 --> 01:39:39,839
Tell him to lose the gun.

1043
01:39:39,964 --> 01:39:41,341
Drop the gun!

1044
01:39:48,515 --> 01:39:51,393
What a good police officer you make, Silvio!

1045
01:39:53,478 --> 01:39:55,021
Now exit the car.

1046
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:00,193
Exit the car, Silvio.

1047
01:40:19,713 --> 01:40:21,131
What do you want?

1048
01:40:38,106 --> 01:40:40,024
Don't move, motherfucker!

1049
01:40:40,150 --> 01:40:41,067
Do you know who I am?

1050
01:40:41,568 --> 01:40:43,486
- I am a jefe!
- Lay down.

1051
01:40:43,903 --> 01:40:44,738
Lay down!

1052
01:40:52,787 --> 01:40:54,664
I know who you are.

1053
01:40:56,416 --> 01:40:58,793
You're Manuel Diaz.

1054
01:40:59,461 --> 01:41:04,632
But right now you're the guy
who's going to take me

1055
01:41:06,384 --> 01:41:09,137
to meet your jefe.

1056
01:41:09,262 --> 01:41:10,305
Get up!

1057
01:41:16,644 --> 01:41:19,606
If you try anything,

1058
01:41:19,731 --> 01:41:22,442
your daughters will be violated by 20 men.

1059
01:41:22,817 --> 01:41:23,902
Turn around!

1060
01:41:24,027 --> 01:41:25,111
Turn around!

1061
01:41:32,285 --> 01:41:34,287
Get in!

1062
01:42:08,071 --> 01:42:09,614
I know who you are.

1063
01:42:10,406 --> 01:42:12,325
It's Manuel. It's clear.

1064
01:42:18,991 --> 01:42:21,411
What happens
when we get to the house?

1065
01:42:21,511 --> 01:42:23,752
You'll stop the car, I'll get out.

1066
01:42:26,151 --> 01:42:27,676
What will happen to me?

1067
01:42:29,311 --> 01:42:30,392
Slow down.

1068
01:43:02,351 --> 01:43:03,512
<i>Señor</i> Diaz?

1069
01:43:22,791 --> 01:43:23,872
<i>Six remain.</i>

1070
01:43:25,751 --> 01:43:27,116
<i>We're going blind.</i>

1071
01:44:36,761 --> 01:44:38,179
Bon appétit.

1072
01:44:41,391 --> 01:44:42,976
Stay calm

1073
01:44:43,768 --> 01:44:45,561
or we're dead.

1074
01:44:46,479 --> 01:44:48,773
Do your children speak English?

1075
01:44:49,231 --> 01:44:50,232
No.

1076
01:44:51,150 --> 01:44:52,527
Then we will speak English.

1077
01:44:55,571 --> 01:44:57,198
Eat, eat!

1078
01:45:15,311 --> 01:45:17,882
Every night you have families killed.

1079
01:45:19,711 --> 01:45:22,555
And yet, here you dine.

1080
01:45:25,151 --> 01:45:27,233
Tonight should be no different.

1081
01:45:38,156 --> 01:45:40,450
Eat!

1082
01:45:55,551 --> 01:45:58,202
Do you think the people that sent you here

1083
01:45:58,551 --> 01:45:59,962
are any different?

1084
01:46:03,391 --> 01:46:05,632
Who do you think we learned it from?

1085
01:46:11,951 --> 01:46:13,316
The grieving lawyer.

1086
01:46:16,071 --> 01:46:20,713
Your wife, you think she'd be proud
of what you've become?

1087
01:46:27,471 --> 01:46:29,314
Don't forget about my daughter.

1088
01:46:33,391 --> 01:46:34,916
<i>Sí.</i>

1089
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:37,882
Your little girl...

1090
01:46:43,096 --> 01:46:44,889
It wasn't personal.

1091
01:46:51,521 --> 01:46:53,106
For me it is.

1092
01:47:01,951 --> 01:47:03,601
Not in front of my boys.

1093
01:47:16,337 --> 01:47:18,714
Time to meet God.

1094
01:47:41,511 --> 01:47:43,513
Go ahead and finish your meal.

1095
01:48:43,351 --> 01:48:44,851
I would recommend not standing

1096
01:48:44,951 --> 01:48:47,079
on balconies for a while, Kate.

1097
01:49:17,951 --> 01:49:19,077
Sit down.

1098
01:49:47,111 --> 01:49:49,591
You look like a little
girl when you're scared.

1099
01:50:10,871 --> 01:50:13,841
You remind me of the daughter
they took away from me.

1100
01:50:34,871 --> 01:50:37,317
I need you to sign this piece of paper.

1101
01:50:39,871 --> 01:50:42,715
It basically says that everything we did

1102
01:50:43,991 --> 01:50:45,800
was done by the book.

1103
01:51:06,911 --> 01:51:08,640
I can't sign that.

1104
01:51:10,871 --> 01:51:12,157
Sign it.

1105
01:51:39,031 --> 01:51:40,760
It's okay.

1106
01:51:40,871 --> 01:51:42,396
It's all right.

1107
01:51:43,271 --> 01:51:44,761
I can't sign that.

1108
01:51:55,391 --> 01:51:56,552
God!

1109
01:51:58,911 --> 01:52:01,391
You would be committing suicide, Kate.

1110
01:52:22,671 --> 01:52:24,673
Come on. Sign it.

1111
01:52:49,031 --> 01:52:51,238
You should move to a small town,

1112
01:52:53,111 --> 01:52:55,478
where the rule of law still exists.

1113
01:52:57,271 --> 01:52:59,558
You will not survive here.

1114
01:53:01,151 --> 01:53:02,880
You are not a wolf.

1115
01:53:03,471 --> 01:53:05,712
And this is the land of wolves now.

1116
01:54:43,703 --> 01:54:45,703
Come here, you first.

1117
01:54:46,573 --> 01:54:48,573
You're the captain, go!
