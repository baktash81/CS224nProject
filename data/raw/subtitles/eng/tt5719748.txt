1
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,300
Hey, Mom.

2
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,900
Hey! Where did you find
this stranger?

3
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,100
Found him on the road.

4
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,500
Is it okay if I use your car?
I really need to get to work.

5
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,000
- Sure.
- Yeah?

6
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,500
You don't wanna stay and help us finish
off the last of Bambi with this stew?

7
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,300
I'd love to, I have to go.
Dad, thank you.

8
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,500
Have a good one.

9
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,900
How was it?

10
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,800
Yeah, wasn't too bad.

11
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,000
Hey...

12
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,900
you're gonna have to
say a few words tonight.

13
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,600
How many?

14
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,100
Well...

15
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,600
Lincoln did, what,
282 for the Gettysburg Address.

16
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,400
So, 100?

17
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,600
Come on, they're just
trying to thank you.

18
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,800
It's not gonna be
a firing squad.

19
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,000
That would be
over quick, though.

20
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,100
Is that new?

21
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,300
No.

22
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,600
Just tuck it there.

23
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,500
Um...

24
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,500
Um, I'm... I'm no speech giver.

25
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,300
But I sure as heck am very honored to
be named Kehoe's Citizen of the Year.

26
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,200
However, if... if
it were up to me...

27
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,800
I'd give it to
somebody more important.

28
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,700
Uh... I'm a...

29
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm just a guy who keeps a strip

30
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,900
of civilization open
through the wilderness for people.

31
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,500
Hmm...

32
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,200
When you...

33
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,700
when you drive the same road
day after day,

34
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,600
it's... easy to start thinking
about the road not taken.

35
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,800
I try not to do that.
You see...

36
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,100
I was lucky.

37
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,200
I picked a good road early...

38
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,300
and I stayed on it.

39
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,400
Hey, kid. How was your day?

40
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
Easy!

41
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,500
Kyle. Kyle!

42
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,700
- Shut up!
- Help!

43
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,900
Shut up!

44
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,200
Get his arms!

45
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,500
- Get his belt!
- I got it.

46
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,100
Pull it down.

47
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,100
Help!

48
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,300
Shit.

49
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,300
- What's going on?
- I don't wanna go.

50
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,100
Hey, I know you're smart
but you're not that smart.

51
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,500
Uh, hey.

52
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,200
- Doesn't wanna go.
- Ah, shit.

53
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,400
Let me guess,
this is about Tim, right?

54
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
Ryan's got a bully in his class.

55
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,800
Tim rubbed his face
in the dirt yesterday.

56
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,100
Do you know what a bully is?

57
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,200
It's a chance
to prove your mettle.

58
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,400
Now, you don't wanna
waste those chances in life.

59
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,100
- He's a lot bigger than I am.
- Yeah, even better.

60
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,400
Are you saying
I should hit him?

61
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,800
Yeah, for a start.

62
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,700
- That's not a very good idea.
- Oh yeah, why not?

63
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,400
Because then I'll be
as stupid as he is.

64
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,200
Listen... come here, come here.

65
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,100
I gave you <i>Lord of the Flies</i>
for your birthday.

66
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,300
I'll bet you haven't
even started it yet.

67
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,000
Well, then that's too bad.

68
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,900
All the answers you'll ever need
are in that book.

69
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,200
Come on, time to go.

70
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,300
You were a real wild man last night.

71
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,000
- There's no one crazier than you, buddy.
- Who knew you could dance.

72
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,100
- Ah, good times, huh?
- Tell you what, we'll do this again, huh.

73
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,100
Yeah!

74
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,300
You look good.
Get you some breakfast.

75
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,200
Jesus, Grace.

76
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,500
Your son.

77
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,400
He died of a heroin overdose.

78
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,700
Um, excuse me.

79
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,000
Kyle wasn't a druggie.

80
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,600
Sorry, but all the parents
say that.

81
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,000
But he... he wasn't a druggie.

82
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,300
What... what are you gonna do?

83
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,600
I'll be turning it
over to Vice and Narcotics.

84
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,200
We didn't know our own son.

85
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,600
Kyle wasn't a druggie.

86
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,400
You're not listening!

87
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,900
He leadeth me to the paths
of righteousness for His name's sake.

88
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,300
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

89
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,500
I shall fear no evil
for thou art with me...

90
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,400
Thou anointest
my head with oil.

91
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,100
My cup runneth over.

92
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,300
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me

93
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,800
all the days of my life.

94
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,700
And I shall dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

95
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,400
Hmm?

96
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,900
Nels?

97
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,700
Dante?

98
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,000
Dante?

99
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,800
I'm sorry, Nels.

100
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,500
I'm really sorry.

101
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,900
It wasn't supposed
to end like this.

102
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,800
I know where and when
the cocaine arrives.

103
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,400
Kyle didn't know about any of this.
That's the truth.

104
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
It was just one bag.

105
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,600
Just one bag!

106
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,200
But people like that,
they always find out.

107
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,200
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What people?

108
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,900
What people do you mean?

109
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,600
Um...

110
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,600
Do you have...
do you have any cash?

111
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,500
- If they find me, they'll hurt me!
- What people!

112
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,600
- Please! Please!
- What people do you mean?

113
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,500
Speedo, there's a guy
named Speedo.

114
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,100
- Speedo?
- He's the only one I know!

115
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,800
Just tell me
where I can find this guy

116
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,000
and then you get the hell
out of here!

117
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,800
Where is he?

118
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,200
So, you're Speedo?

119
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,900
Bingo, gold star.

120
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,000
Dante says hello.

121
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,500
I don't know any Dantes.

122
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,900
Yes, you do.

123
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,700
He worked at the Kehoe airport
with my son... Kyle.

124
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,300
You know him too.

125
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,900
Kyle?

126
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,600
Oh, yeah.
Kyle, that's your kid?

127
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,700
Yeah, yeah, I, uh...
No, I don't know him. Sorry.

128
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,600
I know a lot of people,
I know a lot of... Kyles.

129
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,000
Tell me what happened.

130
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,300
Tell me.

131
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,600
All right, Pops.
There's the door, all right?

132
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,600
I don't know what igloo you crawled out of
but I think it's time you crawled back in.

133
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,100
And trust me,
that's your, uh, best move.

134
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,600
Okay?

135
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,600
You have my phone?

136
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,900
Tell me what happened.

137
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,000
I was...

138
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,900
I was just taking orders.

139
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,500
Taking orders from who?

140
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Who!

141
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,600
- Limbo.
- Huh?

142
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,300
- Limbo.
- Limbo?

143
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,600
Limbo.

144
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,000
Limbo.

145
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,000
Limbo...

146
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,200
Is that him? That Limbo?

147
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,500
<i>No doubt about it, Dan Reeves
was at least in the top three best coaches.</i>

148
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,100
<i>And since we're strolling down
memory lane at the Mile High Stadium,</i>

149
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,800
<i>here's a late night question
for you, Denver.</i>

150
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,800
<i>Greatest quarterback ever,
Elway or Manning?</i>

151
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,200
<i>Give me a call on 555-2395.</i>

152
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,400
Elway.

153
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,700
Aren't you gonna ask
where I've been?

154
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,500
Uh, Speedo's missing.

155
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,600
Who's Speedo?

156
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
One of my employees.
But you wouldn't know about him,

157
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,900
because we don't talk about business
on the way to school, do we?

158
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,800
Who packed these?

159
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,500
- Didn't think a treat would kill him.
- High fructose corn syrup.

160
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,000
Lecithin.

161
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,000
Baking soda?

162
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,200
The only thing not in those
is rat poison.

163
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,000
I want you to know...

164
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,000
I had no hand in this.

165
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,200
I say make them all legal.

166
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,600
Meth, ex, opium.

167
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,300
An opium den in every mall,
that's my platform.

168
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,400
Give the people what they want.

169
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,000
Tax the shit out of it,
then double our pay.

170
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,100
- What do you think about that?
- No thanks.

171
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,200
I wanna be able to tell
the good guys from the bad guys.

172
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,200
That way I'll know who to shoot.

173
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,900
Nels Coxman.

174
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,100
Citizen of the Year.

175
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,700
Good for him.

176
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,800
It's a real word, you know,
cocksman.

177
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,800
It means "a man adept
at the art of fornication."

178
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,000
Nice.

179
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,400
You see these guys?

180
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,500
Whoa. Whoa, hey...

181
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,600
It's just weed.

182
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,200
Yeah, it's legal to purchase,
legal to smoke at home.

183
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,300
Take a breath.
Come on, breathe.

184
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,700
There's a principle
you need to get on board with

185
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,900
if you intend to survive and
advance in Kehoe law enforcement.

186
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,100
It's called community policing.

187
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,900
Wherein we embrace and enforce
the values of our community.

188
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,300
The values of them
giving us the finger?

189
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,200
We're a ski town. Folks come here to
ski, have sex and get high.

190
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,900
So lighten up.

191
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,200
Here, you wanna get your Dirty Harry on?

192
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,800
The meter just hit zero.

193
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,200
Get rid of the gum.

194
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,300
So, what can I do for you, boss?

195
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,900
Uh, I'm...

196
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,100
I'll be right with you.

197
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,900
- Just can't believe this is happening.
- Give me one second.

198
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,500
What's the verdict back here?

199
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,700
Wow.

200
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,300
It's absolutely stunning.

201
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,600
Hmm. Yeah,
I can't believe this.

202
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,700
I love the detail
in the lace. The shape.

203
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,000
- It's so elegant, right?
- Yes.

204
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,000
No, I absolutely
love it. I think this is it.

205
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,800
- I think I'm gonna cry.
- It's so stupid.

206
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,300
You look absolutely...

207
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,100
I'll throw in the veil
at no extra charge.

208
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,200
Wow!

209
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,600
- Congratulations.
- Thanks for everything.

210
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,700
It feels surreal.

211
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,700
All right.
How can I help you, boss?

212
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,400
Uh, I'm, uh,
I'm looking for a tux.

213
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,700
You got it. When is the wedding?

214
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,100
It's not a wedding. My...

215
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,400
my wife and I,
we're renewing our vows.

216
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,600
Still going strong, huh?

217
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,400
That's what I like to hear.

218
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,800
- How's about we get you measured, huh?
- Sure.

219
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,200
You killed my boy.

220
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,700
Who told you to do it?

221
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,900
Who?

222
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,500
Santa. Santa.

223
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,600
- "Santa"?
- That's what he goes by.

224
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,200
Where can I find this "Santa"?

225
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,400
There's a little airport
in Kehoe.

226
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,500
He flies in with the coke
and out with the money.

227
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,000
What does he look like?

228
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,300
He looks like a Santa.

229
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,600
No! Come on, please. You don't
have to do that. Come on, please.

230
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,100
Elway or Manning?

231
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,300
What?

232
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,300
Greatest quarterback ever.
Elway or Manning?

233
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,900
Elway.

234
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,100
Did you know Kyle
had a Facebook?

235
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,300
Do you know his favorite band?

236
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,200
He posted his favorite movies,
do you know those?

237
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,600
What'd the two of you talk about
on your damn hunting trips?

238
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,000
Hunting.

239
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,600
Damn it.

240
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,900
Goddamn.

241
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,000
Damn it!

242
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,100
- That's the fourth gym bag you've lost.
- Yeah, but who's counting, right?

243
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,600
You might find this
hard to believe

244
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,500
but I've got more important things
to do than keep track of gym bags.

245
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,200
Like earning the money
to pay for them.

246
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,700
Tell you what...

247
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,800
why don't you take this

248
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,600
and buy him every single
goddamn gym bag he'll ever need.

249
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,200
Does that work for you?

250
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,200
All right.

251
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,200
Well, that's for you.

252
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,200
- Tell me this is a joke.
- No.

253
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,900
That's Ryan's new diet.
And you're gonna follow it to the letter.

254
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,900
Breakfast: grass-fed beef,
asparagus, cashews.

255
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Lunch, the same.
Dinner, the same.

256
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,700
Yeah, that's on Mondays. Tuesday it
rotates. Chicken, broccoli and almonds.

257
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,400
For breakfast, lunch and dinner?

258
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,100
You want our son to eat the
same thing three times a day?

259
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,100
Eighty percent of our immune
system starts in the gut.

260
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,400
Keep it simple in the gut,
you get to live a long life.

261
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,800
A week on this diet
and he'll wanna kill himself.

262
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,800
And I'll help him do it.

263
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,700
You know what,
you should be grateful.

264
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:16,600
My dad started my day with half a
grapefruit and three lines of primo coke.

265
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,500
"Breakfast of champions,"
he called it.

266
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,200
And now your son can't look at a
candy bar without breaking into hives.

267
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,400
Congratulations,
you've broken the cycle.

268
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,600
And to think...

269
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,900
I used to love the mouth on you.

270
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,500
I've spoken to my lawyer.

271
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,400
We want a new arrangement.
Ten days with me, four with you.

272
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,800
Huh.

273
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,000
Here's my counter offer.
14 days with me and none with you.

274
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,400
Let's see what your lawyer
thinks about that.

275
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,400
- Morning, Aya.
- Hey, Mustang.

276
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,700
They say Limbo's disappeared.

277
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,700
Don't worry about it,
he'll get over it.

278
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,300
Is that Mozart?

279
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,300
Bach.

280
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,600
You can always tell Bach
because he's really mathematical.

281
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,000
- Is he the one with all the kids?
- Yeah, 20.

282
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,100
It's a wonder he found
any time to compose.

283
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,900
I need your help
with my fantasy football.

284
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,900
I can't... I can't win a game.

285
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,900
Playing for money?

286
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,900
Yeah, of course
I'm playing for money.

287
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,200
You got four Cleveland Browns
on your team.

288
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,800
Well, they're my home team.

289
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,400
What's a man without loyalty?

290
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,700
I can't help you.

291
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,200
Hey, there's not enough
room to pass,

292
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,400
I was wondering if you'd
back down to the turnoff?

293
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,700
Any chance you could back up?

294
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,900
Um, just between you and me,
right?

295
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,200
Me, you and frosty.

296
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,500
Sure.

297
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,900
You have no clue
who you're messing with, man.

298
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,500
Who am I messing with?

299
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,700
You're dust, pal.

300
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,000
Tell me.

301
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,800
You're wasting your time.

302
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,800
Are you tired, old man?

303
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,600
Yeah.

304
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,900
Grace?

305
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,400
Grace?

306
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,300
What are you doing here?

307
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,600
Kyle's dead.

308
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,600
Somebody killed him.

309
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,500
What's that got to do with me?

310
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,900
Can I come in?

311
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:18,100
Better take your shoes off. She'll
skin you alive.

312
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,000
I'm going to make
some phone calls.

313
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,900
Find out what happened to Kyle.

314
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,600
She thinks you're one
of the guys from the old days.

315
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,300
Don't worry about her.

316
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:07,100
Kyle. He got mixed up with some
clown by the name of Dante.

317
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,800
And they stole
a kilo of coke from Viking.

318
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,900
- Who's Viking?
- Drug dealer. A big one.

319
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,900
- You know him?
- Yeah, when he was a snot-nosed kid.

320
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,800
- I knew his old man, Bullitt.
- Dad knew him, too?

321
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:25,700
Whenever Bullitt had rough stuff to be done,
that was his go-to guy. After Dad, me.

322
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,900
And then Viking took over.

323
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,500
Viking's a whole
different breed.

324
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,300
He likes hurting people.

325
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,500
I'm gonna kill him, Brock.

326
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,700
Sure you are.

327
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,200
What makes you think
you can kill a man?

328
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,500
I've...

329
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,600
I've killed three of his guys.

330
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,800
What did you do with the bodies?

331
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:59,300
Wrapped them in chicken wire,
threw them on the gorge.

332
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,200
- Chicken wire?
- Yeah, to let the fish get at them.

333
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,500
They'll eat the flesh
off the bones.

334
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,100
So the bodies don't fill
with gas and rise.

335
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,200
They stay at the bottom.

336
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,700
- Where did you learn that?
- I read it in a crime novel.

337
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:33,000
- He is my brother.
- Brother?

338
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,000
My ass.

339
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,600
I know.

340
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
- Maybe I should...
- Shut up.

341
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,400
You stay out of trouble.

342
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,900
The things we do for love, huh?

343
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,100
She was skimming the till
at a massage parlor.

344
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,700
They sent me to beat the shit
out of her. Instead...

345
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,900
How's Grace?

346
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,000
She left.

347
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,200
The lady's got good timing,
I'll give her that.

348
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,100
How do I find this Viking?

349
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,200
You don't.

350
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,200
- You've gone as far up the ladder as you're gonna go.
- We'll see.

351
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,100
One guy can disappear.
Two? I don't think so.

352
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,100
Three? With ten keys of coke?

353
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,900
Maybe they were
all in it together.

354
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:50,200
You think three of my dealers
ran out on me?

355
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:55,100
That would make me the worst judge of
character in the Rockies, that's your theory?

356
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,200
- No.
- No.

357
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,300
It was those goddamn Indians.

358
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,000
This is all my father's fault
for getting into bed with them.

359
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,500
I'm sorry, the Indians?

360
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,600
When Viking's father
was first getting started,

361
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,000
he made a deal with an
Indian named White Bull.

362
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,500
He supplied him, White Bull
dealt on the reservation.

363
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,700
Until White Bull
wanted more turf.

364
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,500
- So he tossed White Bull a few piece of crap towns.
- Like Kehoe.

365
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,100
And Kehoe builds a ski resort.
Turns it into a gold mine.

366
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,500
What's the one thing
history's taught us?

367
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,700
You keep those Indians
on the reservation.

368
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:38,000
Those Indians,
they're always wanting more.

369
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,500
Because they think the turf
was theirs all along.

370
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,800
Might kinda have
a point there, right.

371
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,600
White Bull gave this
to my father...

372
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,800
the day they shook
on their deal.

373
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,300
Yeah.

374
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,800
It's time we give it
back to him.

375
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,500
What can I do for you two?

376
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,100
You could sit down with us.
Tell us your story.

377
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,900
I got other customers.

378
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,700
Yeah, that's funny.
All I can see in here is you.

379
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,400
Please tell me you work nights.

380
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,500
Thursdays. Why?

381
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,900
You look this good in sunlight,
I gotta see you after dark.

382
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,800
Eggs, bacon, pancakes.

383
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,300
And for you?

384
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,600
Surprise me.

385
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,400
Okay.

386
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,200
I was 13 when my dad kicked it.
You know his last words to me?

387
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:50,100
"Try to bang every waitress
who ever serves you."

388
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,100
This Indian is
taking forever to show up.

389
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:07,600
So, tell me
about this motel trick of yours.

390
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,000
Twenty bucks.

391
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,300
It's not a trick, all right.

392
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:17,700
It's a beautiful invention. It's an invention
Steve Jobs would have been proud of.

393
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,200
- Steve Jobs, huh?
- That's right.

394
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:22,500
You know what made that guy
such a genius? Simplicity.

395
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,200
- Let's hear it already.
- All right.

396
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,100
I stay in motels
100 nights a year, right.

397
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,300
First thing, every morning, I hang a
"clean the room" sign on the doorknob.

398
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,500
Maid sees the sign,
she opens the door.

399
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,900
Now, pay attention
to the details here.

400
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,100
All the hard thought
behind them.

401
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:43,700
I'm lying on top of the covers,
stone naked.

402
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,800
First crucial part,
I look into the maid's eyes, all right?

403
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:52,300
If I don't, she backs right outta that
door. It's over before it even starts.

404
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:56,600
I take the twenty,
I lay it right on my Jimmy.

405
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,600
- Boom.
- Just a twenty?

406
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:02,100
Maids make $8.35 an hour,
and they've got miserable lives too.

407
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,100
That's the totally
underrated part of this.

408
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,700
The ball is completely
in her court.

409
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,900
She could back out of that door
no harm, no foul.

410
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,200
Or... she could come and get it.

411
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,300
- What's your success rate?
- Thirty-one percent.

412
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,700
Hundred motels a year,
you do the math.

413
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,200
He's got the same little
yellow gloves White Bull wears.

414
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,600
- Is that an Indian thing?
- I guess.

415
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,800
It's good.

416
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,600
That's Steve fucking Jobs good.

417
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,400
I see one flaw. Quality control.

418
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,300
I'm paying her 20 bucks,
I'm not asking for Miss America.

419
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:48,900
Still, there's no way there's 31 maids
in the whole country worth banging.

420
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,700
You'd be surprised.

421
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,600
Oh dear.

422
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,700
Been at it all night,
haven't gotten a thing out of him.

423
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,500
And you won't.

424
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,300
You know, pain...

425
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,400
it's like a religion
to these guys.

426
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,400
You know, the Apaches used to consider
getting tortured a mark of honor.

427
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,000
How's that for a value system?

428
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,500
- He's a Ute.
- What now?

429
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,400
Local Indians are Utes.
Not Apache.

430
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,500
You know I married an Indian.
Don't you think I know the difference?

431
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,400
This doesn't happen
in Kehoe.

432
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,300
It just did.

433
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,700
It was his first run.

434
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,700
"Just one run, Papa,"
he says to me.

435
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,100
"I can do it."

436
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,700
"I'm your son."

437
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,300
What are we going to do?

438
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,100
Okay, let's go home to Denver.

439
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:10,500
Mr. Coxman.

440
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,700
I'm very sorry for your loss.

441
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,300
Thanks.

442
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:35,700
Hey.

443
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,000
So...

444
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,900
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

445
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:44,500
Ex-boyfriend of mine works Vice in Denver.
So I gave him a call today.

446
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,700
Because you missed him and
wanted to see how he was doing.

447
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,300
Well, he still thinks
there's a chance for us.

448
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,600
What's his name?

449
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,200
Kurt.

450
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:59,800
- How long were you two lovers?
- Oh, Jesus. Two months, okay.

451
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:05,300
I had him look up the forensics
on our sign hanger.

452
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,800
The guy's name is Simon LeGrew.

453
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,500
Now, his father is White Bull.

454
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,000
He's a Native American
drug dealer from Denver

455
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,900
who's been dealing coke
around here for 30 years.

456
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,600
So now, White Bull
shares territory with Viking.

457
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:23,400
He's a Denver drug dealer whose
real name is Trevor Calcote.

458
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:24,900
So...

459
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,900
I'm thinking...

460
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,200
what we have here is a turf war.

461
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,600
A drug turf war.

462
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,000
Right here in Kehoe.

463
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,200
So what are we gonna
do about it?

464
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:48,400
Well, my 30 years' experience tells
me that this is a job for Denver Vice.

465
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:52,900
It doesn't bother you that I just
learned more about a local drug lord

466
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
in five minutes on the phone
than you've learned in 30 years?

467
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:01,600
What bothers me is that Kurt's lying in bed
tonight convinced that he's back in your heart.

468
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,600
Kurt's a big boy.

469
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,200
I knew you'd be back.

470
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,600
All right, Viking's real name
is Trevor Calcote.

471
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,200
If you want him dead,
you're gonna have to hire a hit man.

472
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:22,000
- A hit man?
- Yeah. An assassin.

473
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,900
Do you know one?

474
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,000
The Eskimo.

475
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,700
So, how does this work?

476
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,800
You buy The Eskimo a train ticket.
He's afraid to fly.

477
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:39,100
You pick him up at the train
station, you drive him to a motel

478
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,400
where you give him
half the money upfront.

479
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,800
And then you go home.

480
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,600
- How do I know when it's done?
- Keep checking <i>The Denver Post.</i>

481
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,700
They can't resist
a good rub out.

482
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,700
What is it with all these nicknames?
Speedo, Viking, Eskimo.

483
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,100
The Eskimo.
It's a gangster thing.

484
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,800
Did you have a nickname?

485
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,000
Yeah. Wingman.

486
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:07,300
Wingman?

487
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,700
Yeah, from <i>Top Gun.</i>
As in "you can be my Wingman."

488
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,500
Wingman.

489
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,300
Come on.

490
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,300
I tried, buddy.

491
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,400
Some real music, please.

492
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,800
- What do you want to hear?
- Anything else.

493
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,700
Just no Kanye.

494
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:55,100
Take it out of his tip.

495
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:10,700
There's a convention in town.
This is all I could get.

496
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:34,000
- This is only half.
- That's right.

497
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,700
Are you a cop?

498
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,200
No.

499
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,200
The reason I ask is cops are
always a year behind the street.

500
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:55,400
But the street knows it's two-thirds
upfront, one-third when the deal is done.

501
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:59,100
But cops... they still think
it's half and half.

502
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,500
Okay. We can do two-thirds.

503
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:19,000
We're gonna get along
just fine.

504
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:21,900
Yes!

505
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,100
Yes! Ten grand! Ten grand, baby!

506
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,400
Ten grand!

507
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,300
That Jet touchdown
just beat your Browns.

508
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,500
Whatever happened to loyalty?

509
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,400
Sometimes loyalty
comes at a price.

510
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,800
And besides,
my grandmother's from Brooklyn.

511
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:44,400
So? Why don't you
give her a cut?

512
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,300
Yeah?

513
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:54,000
Says he's The Eskimo.

514
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,400
Says he has information
you wanna buy.

515
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,200
Let's hear him out.

516
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:07,200
I've been offered
ninety grand to ice you.

517
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:08,600
To ice me?

518
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:13,000
You wanna ice a guy, you go to The Eskimo.
Well, that works for me.

519
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,900
Who knew White Bull
had that kind of coin?

520
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
White Bull's an Indian.
Indians don't farm out their kills.

521
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:21,500
So, if it wasn't White Bull,
then who the hell was it?

522
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,900
That's what I'm selling.

523
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,900
- Well, how much?
- Ninety grand.

524
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,600
You gotta love
the symmetry, there.

525
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:32,400
You are one hell
of a businessman.

526
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,700
I tries.

527
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,000
Try. It's a singular.

528
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:42,400
- Do we have a deal?
- 'Course we got a deal.

529
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,000
Deposit the money into
this Cayman Islands account.

530
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,600
When it hits, you get the name.

531
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:51,900
Goody.

532
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,500
I like working with pros.

533
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,700
Cuts way down
on the bullshit factor.

534
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,700
Yeah. So...

535
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,100
who wants me dead?

536
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,000
Guy's name is Coxman.

537
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,100
Coxman.

538
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:20,600
There was a Coxman
on Dad's payroll, right?

539
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:24,500
What was his name? He called
himself, uh, Wing... Ding...

540
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,600
Ringworm... Wing... Ding...

541
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,400
- Wingman.
- Wingman!

542
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:29,500
Wingman!

543
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,700
Wingman wants me dead? Why?

544
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
The why of it ain't my
business so I don't aks.

545
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:39,100
Ask.

546
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,100
- I think our business here is done.
- So it is.

547
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:46,800
Hey, can I ask two questions?
If I may.

548
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,000
One pro to another.

549
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,100
Shoot.

550
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,500
Why do they call you The Eskimo?

551
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:03,000
Comes from the brothers
in the hood.

552
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,400
Any nigga crazy enough
to move up to snow country

553
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,500
has gotta be a fucking Eskimo.

554
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,500
That's... you're funny.

555
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,400
- Second question.
- All right, it's...

556
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:20,400
Who taught you your ethics?

557
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:21,700
Come again?

558
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:27,000
You made a deal to kill me for 90
grand and you didn't honor that deal.

559
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:30,600
It's because
I'm honoring this one.

560
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:34,900
Yeah.

561
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,700
Guess a man's word doesn't
matter in the hood, right?

562
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:45,300
Guess it's just every man
for himself in there.

563
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,200
You see, out here,
character counts.

564
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:51,300
Without character there can be
no business and...

565
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,500
without business...

566
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,600
well...

567
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,700
what the hell
would we do all day?

568
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:19,300
Would you mind
stepping off the rug?

569
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,500
Is this what you call
an Eskimo Roll?

570
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,900
I'm thinking Ireland.

571
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,600
Maybe Germany.

572
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,700
Yeah? For what?

573
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,700
- My ten grand vacation.
- Oh.

574
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:01,500
Yeah, well,
Guinness over Becks any day.

575
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,800
Then Dublin it is.

576
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,200
You're gonna take me to Dublin?

577
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:14,800
Yeah.

578
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:18,800
Hey.

579
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,700
Mustang, if we get caught out.

580
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,400
Wingman.

581
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,400
How the hell you been?

582
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:41,100
We'd like you to come
for a little ride.

583
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:05,200
Okay, Wingman,
tell me about The Eskimo.

584
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:08,300
I guess you just don't get
what you pay for anymore.

585
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,500
- Some of us do.
- Oh yeah?

586
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,100
Well, what about Speedo
and Limbo and Santa?

587
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,500
How did those guys
work out for you, huh?

588
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:19,300
Okay. Now before you die,

589
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,600
you're gonna tell me
what this is all about.

590
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:24,800
The only question is,
how much pain do you wanna endure?

591
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:27,100
I got cancer of the ass, dickweed.

592
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,900
So screw you, and screw your pain.

593
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,500
You wanna know
what this is all about?

594
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,400
- It's about Bullitt.
- My father?

595
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,800
Lying piece of shit
stole my woman.

596
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:39,900
Dad banged anything
with a hole.

597
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,400
Hey Bone, what is it
you used to say about him?

598
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,900
He'd bang a rattlesnake
if someone held its head.

599
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,900
- No offense.
- No, none taken.

600
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:50,800
- Dad had thousands of women.
- Yeah, well, one of them was mine.

601
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:55,400
- What's that got to do with me?
- His rancid blood runs through your veins.

602
01:04:55,500 --> 01:05:00,800
And that stupid grin of his is
plastered all over your arrogant face.

603
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,500
Where's my cocaine?

604
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,100
I flushed it down the toilet.

605
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,000
- That was ten kilos.
- At least.

606
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,700
Honestly, I thought it was more.

607
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:18,300
So, you kill my men,

608
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:23,300
you steal my coke,
over a goddamn woman?

609
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:28,000
It's called love, sweetheart.
You should try it sometime.

610
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:30,900
Now, are we done?

611
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:34,400
Or do you want
to keep on chatting, skippy?

612
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:36,700
Nah.

613
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,000
Okay, Wingman.

614
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:44,000
See, that's
how you do it, fellas.

615
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,600
That's how you go out strong.

616
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,800
Kehoe Precinct.

617
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,400
- Yeah, just a sec. Kim.
- Yeah?

618
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:28,400
Denver Vice.

619
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,500
Kurt, hi.

620
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:38,200
<i>So, that deep dive into Viking
and White Bull that you asked for...</i>

621
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:39,900
<i>I got all the files here.</i>

622
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:41,700
You're the best.

623
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,900
<i>Wasn't easy.</i>

624
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,300
Thank you.
Can you email them over?

625
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:49,300
<i>I could. Or I could drive them up and
put them right into your warm hands.</i>

626
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:53,300
<i>'Course, it's a three-hour drive,
so I need a place to stay the night.</i>

627
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:58,000
Well, there's always my place.
But, here's the thing.

628
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:01,800
I really need to spend
all night with those files.

629
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:05,100
Now, if you were to shoot them
right over to me,

630
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,700
I could probably be done
with them by tonight.

631
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:12,500
And then I could put all my pent
up energy into something else.

632
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:17,800
<i>Hmm. Okay, well,
you got them, baby. Bang.</i>

633
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:19,300
<i>Right in your inbox.</i>

634
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:20,900
Oh, they're right in there.

635
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,500
<i>So, how do we wanna do this?</i>

636
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:26,700
<i>I'm thinking you leave the
door open and your lights off.</i>

637
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,800
<i>Trust me to find...</i>

638
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:32,000
Hold on a second. What was that?

639
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:34,500
- <i>I said...</i>
- Oh God, we got an avalanche.

640
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,100
I gotta call you back.

641
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,100
Oh, hey, Gip?

642
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:46,400
Yes!

643
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:01,500
<i>Do I look like
a homeless guy to you?</i>

644
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:05,100
<i>Thirty years ago...</i>

645
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:10,600
<i>I lived in a hole in the ground below
the house of the guy that dealt me drugs.</i>

646
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:14,300
<i>One day, he came to me,</i>

647
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:16,600
<i>stuck out his hand.</i>

648
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:20,800
<i>I took it.</i>

649
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:24,200
<i>And we made a deal.</i>

650
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,000
<i>It was a good deal.</i>

651
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,800
<i>Not a great deal.</i>

652
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,900
<i>I should have bought a casino
like my brother.</i>

653
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,200
<i>But a deal is a deal.</i>

654
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,100
<i>And I honored it.</i>

655
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:48,200
That honor...

656
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:51,200
was repaid with butchery.

657
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,200
They took my only son.

658
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,000
Today...

659
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:04,700
my boy will make
his final journey home.

660
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,500
We will stay.

661
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,100
Take our revenge.

662
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,400
I will have blood for blood.

663
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:19,400
A son for a son.

664
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:08,900
Hi.

665
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:12,200
- Goddamn it.
- You forgot.

666
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:13,300
What?

667
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,300
- What?
- The bullying seminar.

668
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:17,400
Oh, God.

669
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:21,200
- Every other parent was there.
- You're right, I forgot about the bullying seminar.

670
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,000
But I'm allowed to forget,
you know why?

671
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:25,300
Because I wrote a check
for a new computer center.

672
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:29,600
You write a check, you get to skip on
150 bullying seminars. That's the math.

673
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:32,600
That's one of the perks
of my business.

674
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:35,900
You're not a businessman,
Trevor. You're a criminal.

675
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:41,400
My powder's not good enough for you anymore?
I remember when it was plenty good enough.

676
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:43,300
When you used
to roll around in it.

677
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:47,900
Ah.

678
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:53,200
See, I remember when just
a little bit of my powder...

679
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:58,700
made you buck like a bronco.

680
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,200
Goddamn.

681
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:07,200
Close those beautiful
brown eyes of yours.

682
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,600
See if it all
comes back to you.

683
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:19,400
They needed a host for next week's
fundraiser. I signed you up.

684
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:34,900
Here.

685
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,700
Three of Viking's drug dealers
have disappeared in the last week.

686
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,800
Tell me who Viking is again?

687
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:44,800
The Denver drug lord.
White Bull's rival.

688
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,900
Let me ask you a question.

689
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,900
What is it you think we might
do to Viking or to White Bull?

690
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,400
Take them out. Save our town.

691
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:00,500
We got a little problem
to solve.

692
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:02,200
We...

693
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:05,000
we hung an innocent Indian
from a road sign.

694
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:07,700
And my guess is White Bull's
not gonna like that.

695
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:11,900
So, has anyone got any ideas on
how we might set things right?

696
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:14,400
Yeah, maybe we should apologize.

697
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:16,500
Yeah?

698
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,900
One little screw up shouldn't
make us their bitches.

699
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,800
So we send them a short note.

700
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:23,800
Hey, and what does
this, uh, short note say?

701
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,800
I don't know. How about,

702
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:28,600
"Sorry about Tonto,
won't happen again"?

703
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,500
No.

704
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:38,200
I'm thinking we need something with a
bit more oomph. Something from our heart.

705
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:58,000
Yeah, cut off his head.
Stick it in a box and send it to them.

706
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,600
Tell them he's the culprit.

707
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:04,100
Tell them our old arrangement's
back in effect and good to go.

708
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:19,300
Get that shit away from me, man.

709
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,100
What the hell's wrong with you?

710
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:26,400
We've got some of the best pot
stores in the world, man. All legal.

711
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:30,300
But no, instead you choose to
smoke that dang reservation weed.

712
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,100
Maybe I like it better.

713
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,300
- White people, man.
- Yeah.

714
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:44,900
You know I had a rat
that was bigger than that thing.

715
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:52,300
You should try smoking
that shit instead.

716
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:54,100
That's gross.

717
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,200
Mom!

718
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:05,600
She gets him this week,
father gets him next week.

719
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:10,900
Can you imagine
sharing your own son?

720
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:13,100
Damn.

721
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,100
- Kehoe.
- <i>Hey, it's Kurt.</i>

722
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:21,500
Hi, Kurt.

723
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,600
<i>You don't deserve this intel.</i>

724
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:26,400
Intel?

725
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,700
<i>First tell me
you don't deserve it.</i>

726
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,000
I don't deserve it.
What you got?

727
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:36,000
<i>A body. Dante Ferstel. Kehoe kid.
Found dead in a Denver alley.</i>

728
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:38,100
<i>Smack overdose.
So, what's new, right?</i>

729
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,300
<i>Just another
Saturday night sleeper.</i>

730
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:44,500
<i>And here's the kicker.
Dante was a baggage monkey at the airport.</i>

731
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:47,400
The Kehoe airport?

732
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,100
Mr. Coxman.

733
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,700
What can I do for you?

734
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,400
It's about your son.

735
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:14,800
- I didn't know if you'd heard about Dante Ferstel.
- Yeah. He died of an overdose.

736
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:22,000
Dante worked with your son
at the airport, right?

737
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,300
- Yeah.
- Did you know him?

738
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:28,100
No.

739
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,100
Kyle never mention him to you?

740
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:32,300
No.

741
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:40,600
Is that it?

742
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:43,300
I guess it is.

743
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:51,600
I don't understand
why you're here.

744
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:53,600
Truth?

745
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,900
I don't think
your son was a junkie.

746
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:02,300
And I don't think
Dante Ferstel was either.

747
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:06,400
So, what do you think
happened to them?

748
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:08,200
I don't know.

749
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:13,200
I was hoping you might be able to
tell me something that could help.

750
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:18,500
Sorry...

751
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:21,300
I can't help you.

752
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,200
You can't help me.
I got work to do.

753
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,300
I understand.

754
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:31,700
Tape.

755
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:33,700
Taser.

756
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:35,700
Antibiotics.

757
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:37,600
Antibiotics?

758
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:40,100
Yeah, you ever been bitten
by a kid?

759
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,500
Little bastards are nasty.
You almost wish you were bitten by a dog.

760
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:50,500
Yes?

761
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:53,800
Okay.

762
01:17:57,700 --> 01:17:59,200
We can't grab him yet.

763
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:03,300
- Why not?
- They're sending a messenger.

764
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:14,600
I am the messenger.

765
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,200
Thank you for seeing me.

766
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:39,400
He's been punished for his deed.
We want peace with you again.

767
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:41,200
Okay.

768
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,400
I appreciate the gift.

769
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:47,900
It was thoughtful.

770
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:57,400
You showed a lot of guts
coming here alone.

771
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:04,600
But I need a son for a son.

772
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:43,500
Careful, man!
You might hit a kid.

773
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,900
If you do it again,
I'll kill you.

774
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:52,500
Yes?

775
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,400
- See you guys tomorrow.
- Hey, Ryan.

776
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:58,400
Um, I'm taking you home today.

777
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:01,600
But this is my mom's week
to pick me up.

778
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:05,600
Yeah, I know, but she got stuck at the
dentist. Asked me to come and get you.

779
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,100
What?

780
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:09,300
We take him.

781
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:13,000
- What about the messenger?
- We shot the messenger.

782
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:16,000
I don't remember her telling me
about a trip to the dentist.

783
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:19,700
Yeah, she had a root canal
develop some problems.

784
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:25,200
And your dad said could I pick you up.
So, here I am.

785
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:28,800
- This is us here.
- What happened to the Tesla?

786
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,700
Shit!

787
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:05,200
Seatbelt.

788
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:08,400
- Where's the kid?
- He got away in a van.

789
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:10,700
What kind of a van?

790
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,100
Said "Kehoe" on it.

791
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:17,200
We'll find the kid. We'll find the van.
It won't take us long.

792
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:20,500
Get rid of these two
before they start to stink.

793
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:34,700
Answer the phone.

794
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:44,400
Hello?

795
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:50,100
No, he can't talk right now.

796
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,500
Because he's dead.

797
01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:58,500
Let's go. Three cars.

798
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:00,000
What about the body?

799
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:06,400
Minya, take care of this.

800
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:10,200
I'm busy.
Let the fucking Indian do it.

801
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:25,800
You don't work for my father,
do you?

802
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:32,800
Who were those guys anyways?

803
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:34,600
I don't know.

804
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
You don't have to worry
about them.

805
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:41,700
Right.

806
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:48,000
They can't take my son
and not call.

807
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:50,700
That's not how it's done.

808
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:54,900
Those tepee asswipes.

809
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:58,400
Those goddamn alkies.

810
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:05,100
I'm gonna take one of them, I'm gonna hang
them from every road sign from here to Utah.

811
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,500
You take a man's son, you call!
Everybody knows that!

812
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:15,100
I mean, they took my boy.

813
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:18,000
My little boy.

814
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:20,400
Are you insane!
This is my week.

815
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:22,300
You pick him up without asking?

816
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:25,700
Are you so damn stupid
you'd kidnap your own son?

817
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:28,900
I can't wait to watch my lawyer write
up the new arrangement.

818
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,400
Full custody.

819
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:35,300
You'll be lucky to get him two
hours a month. Two supervised hours.

820
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,200
A cop in the room with you,
watching you play.

821
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:39,700
You won't get him alone until
he graduates from high school.

822
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,500
A public high school!
With normal kids.

823
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,400
And no stupid diets!

824
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,900
I guess you won't be doing that again.

825
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:54,400
Right? Uh-huh.

826
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:59,700
He's not here.

827
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:03,400
- What?
- Ah...

828
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:21,000
Turn that song off.

829
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:30,700
It's a text.
From a different number.

830
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:35,700
"Sequoia Motel. Room twelve."

831
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:38,100
"Steve Jobs, baby."

832
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:56,900
Hello.

833
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,400
A little peepee tepee.

834
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,100
Oh, shit.

835
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:51,400
I know how this world works.

836
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:54,200
They call with their demands.
I give them what they want.

837
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:55,800
We get Ryan back.

838
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:01,900
In 24 hours, I call the police.

839
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,600
In 24 hours, he'll be home.

840
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,200
- You'll burn in hell for this.
- Yeah.

841
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:09,100
I'll see you there.

842
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:00,700
Welcome to Kehoe Chateau Montclair.

843
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:04,700
- We need rooms tonight.
- I'm sorry, you need a reservation.

844
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,000
Excuse me.

845
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:08,000
A reservation.

846
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:10,500
Really?

847
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:13,800
A reser...

848
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:16,700
Oh! No,
I didn't mean it like that.

849
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:20,300
I meant you need to reserve...
book before you get here

850
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,300
because we're all full.
That's all I meant.

851
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:23,900
You know what I heard?

852
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,400
You told me and my friends that we
need to go back to the reservation.

853
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:29,700
Oh, no.

854
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:34,100
Do you have any idea
what I can do to you...

855
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:36,000
on Yelp?

856
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,200
You might wanna get
your boss out here.

857
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:43,200
Or you could take another look.

858
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,800
I will take another look.

859
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:01,700
- You hungry?
- Sure.

860
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:07,400
Eggs?

861
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:08,700
Okay.

862
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:18,000
- You live here?
- Yeah.

863
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:22,900
All alone?

864
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:25,400
Yeah.

865
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:29,200
You don't have any kids?

866
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:32,800
No.

867
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,200
You like rock?

868
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:54,800
I like classical.

869
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:16,300
It wasn't very smart
bringing me to your house.

870
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:19,300
Why?

871
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,500
I want to talk to your dad.

872
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:28,300
Tonight?

873
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:30,300
In the morning.

874
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:42,100
They're a bit greasy.

875
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:54,800
You said you didn't
have any kids.

876
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:57,100
He went away.

877
01:29:57,700 --> 01:29:59,300
Go on, get in bed.

878
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:06,000
Where are you gonna sleep?

879
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,800
In my room, down the hall.

880
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:12,200
- What if I run away?
- There's nowhere for you to go, kid.

881
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:14,800
You'd freeze to death
out there. Goodnight.

882
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:17,300
I always get read
a story before bed.

883
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,200
I don't know any stories.

884
01:30:19,300 --> 01:30:22,300
You can read me anything.
I don't care what it is.

885
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,900
The new C-130 is the crème
de la crème of snow-pushers.

886
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:34,300
Built to humble Mother Nature,
she has a rated load of three tons.

887
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:39,600
The Overhausen UTV attachment snow
blowers are made for universal use,

888
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:42,200
equipped with powerful
modern engines.

889
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:45,100
They're extremely effective
and flexible.

890
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:49,100
A capacity of four thousand
tons of snow per hour.

891
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:52,400
Throwing distance
of a hundred feet.

892
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:55,400
Yeah.

893
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:59,000
She is a great machine,
all right.

894
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:00,600
I've got one of these.

895
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:04,000
I thought you were a kidnapper.

896
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:07,100
Not all the time.

897
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,700
Well, can I get a ride in it?

898
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:16,000
You are going to sleep.

899
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:35,400
Have you heard
of the Stockholm Syndrome?

900
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:24,900
Morning, boss.

901
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:26,700
Did you find him?

902
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:30,100
Not yet. We will.

903
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:32,000
Mr. White Bull.

904
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:35,900
These are some complimentary ski passes.
Good for the whole weekend.

905
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,600
For you and all of your...
friends.

906
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:42,000
And I just wanna thank you again
for choosing to stay with us.

907
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:45,500
We know that you do have
other entertainment options.

908
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:48,700
Thank you.

909
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:53,500
- Janitor from Ryan's school.
- Janitor, why not?

910
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:56,900
It's an honor to be here.
You hear the whispers but...

911
01:32:58,100 --> 01:33:00,500
- You have something for me?
- I might.

912
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:05,300
The van your boy got into.
I've seen it before.

913
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:08,600
And the guy that was driving
that van, I've seen him too.

914
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,400
Me and my family go up
to the resort in Kehoe.

915
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:14,000
You know, the fancy one?

916
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:15,500
- Chateau Montclair.
- Oh, yeah.

917
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:19,600
Well, we're driving up and, you
know, she scoots over and she's...

918
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:23,900
showing a little appreciation
on the way up, you get my drift?

919
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:25,600
- I do.
- Yeah.

920
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:28,200
You ever tried to keep the wheel
straight when someone's...

921
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:29,500
The van.

922
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:37,300
Well, like I was saying.
The van that stopped to help me...

923
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,300
that's the same van
that your boy got into.

924
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:44,500
And the guy who pulled me
out of the ditch that night...

925
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:47,700
he's the same guy
that picked up your boy.

926
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:50,300
He's got one of those names
that you never ever forget.

927
01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:52,500
Coxman.

928
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:55,300
Coxman.

929
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:59,300
Yeah. We laughed about it
all night long.

930
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:02,200
- Because what she was doing...
- Oh my God.

931
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:07,400
- Coxman had a relative.
- And he hasn't spoken with the cops.

932
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:10,600
Well... how much
did my guy offer you?

933
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:12,000
Ten grand.

934
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:14,300
Ten grand it is.

935
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:10,500
Hey! Hey, check him out.

936
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,200
You're crazy, Avalanche!

937
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,600
You sure you've
done this before?

938
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:19,800
I was born to fly, white boy.

939
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:01,700
I have your son.
If you wanna see him alive, come alone.

940
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:03,500
Yeah, yeah.
I know how it's done.

941
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:05,800
So, how much
do you want for him?

942
01:36:06,100 --> 01:36:08,200
We'll talk about that
when you get here.

943
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:11,800
2210 Quarry Road. Kehoe.

944
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:17,300
I'm just leaving Denver.
It's gonna take me about three hours.

945
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:49,000
Jesus Christ.

946
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:57,600
Son of a...

947
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:08,900
- Hey.
- Hey. Taking a day off?

948
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:12,400
- Main road could use a plow.
- I'll get to it soon.

949
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
My nephew. Visiting.

950
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:20,200
Must be a comfort
to have family in town.

951
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:22,400
We saw all the cars
at your place.

952
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:27,000
Yeah.

953
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:36,100
Look at this.

954
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:40,000
- So now we know he's banging a hippie.
- No.

955
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:42,600
On the truck. The company name.

956
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:46,700
- Open Road.
- It's four miles away.

957
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:49,600
- Get the men.
- Let's go.

958
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:02,500
- That was so much fun!
- I need you...

959
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:04,400
to sit here...

960
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:07,700
and wait till someone comes
to get you.

961
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:24,000
- <i>They're headed to Open Road Garage.</i>
- Again. Say what?

962
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:27,800
Open Road Garage.

963
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,600
<i>On Old Bend Road.</i>

964
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:05,800
Ryan!

965
01:39:05,900 --> 01:39:08,500
Come on. Inside. Come on, move.

966
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:12,100
- Why do you have a rifle?
- Just do what I say. Up the stairs, move.

967
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:15,000
Get in the cabinet.

968
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:19,500
Why are you mad at me?

969
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:22,400
I'm not mad at you. It's just...

970
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:25,800
It's just really important
you do what I say.

971
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:28,600
You're a good kid.

972
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:31,900
- What?
- I said don't move.

973
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:18,200
The last Coxman.

974
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:26,400
Where is my son?

975
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:32,500
My business can get very creative,
but I'm an old fashioned kind of guy.

976
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:34,400
I like to keep things simple.

977
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:37,700
So if I have to ask you again,

978
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:40,000
I'm gonna pull out
your fingernails...

979
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:43,700
cut off your fingers,
chop off your hands...

980
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:46,000
and hack off your nose.

981
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:51,900
Oh, and that part
about the nose,

982
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,300
you are really not gonna
like that part.

983
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:56,600
You don't deserve your son.

984
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:01,000
Take him to the garage.

985
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:03,200
Bastard!

986
01:47:01,300 --> 01:47:04,500
<i>Got a kid driving
a snow blower headed towards Kehoe.</i>

987
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:22,500
Get a message...

988
01:47:23,300 --> 01:47:24,800
to Aya.

989
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:31,000
Tell my wife...

990
01:47:34,300 --> 01:47:36,000
tell her she's a...

991
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,500
What are you doing?

992
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,400
My job.
