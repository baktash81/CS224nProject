1
00:01:37,512 --> 00:01:38,998
Wer...

2
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:43,191
- ...are you?
- We are three wise men.

3
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,908
- What?
- We are three wise men.

4
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:49,117
What are you doing creeping around
a cowshed at 2:00 a.m.?

5
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:51,249
That doesn't sound very wise to me.

6
00:01:51,795 --> 00:01:55,627
- We are astrologers.
- We have come from the East.

7
00:01:56,049 --> 00:02:00,213
- Is this some kind of joke?
- We wish to praise the infant.

8
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:03,921
- We must pay a homage to him.
- Homage? You're all drunk!

9
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:06,838
It's disgusting! Out! Come on, out!

10
00:02:06,977 --> 00:02:10,262
Bursting in here with tales about
Oriental fortunetellers. Out!

11
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,398
- No, no, we must see him.
- Go and praise someone else's brat!

12
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:17,481
- We were led by a star!
- Led by a bottle more like! Go on, out!

13
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:20,026
- We must see him. We have presents!
- Out!

14
00:02:20,198 --> 00:02:22,107
Gold, frankincense, myrrh!

15
00:02:22,284 --> 00:02:25,320
Well, why didn't you say?
He's over there.

16
00:02:25,496 --> 00:02:28,746
Sorry the place is a bit of a mess.

17
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,909
Well, what is myrrh anyway?

18
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:33,706
- It is a valuable balm.
- A balm?!

19
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,453
What are you giving him a balm for?
It might bite him!

20
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:39,049
- What?
- That's a dangerous animal!

21
00:02:39,218 --> 00:02:40,926
- Throw it in the trough!
- No, it isn't!

22
00:02:41,137 --> 00:02:44,802
- It's a great big...
- No, no, no, it is an ointment.

23
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,348
Well, there is an animal called
a balm, or did I dream it?

24
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,352
So you're astrologers, are you?
Well, what is he then?

25
00:02:53,524 --> 00:02:56,561
What star-sign is he?

26
00:02:56,736 --> 00:03:00,354
- Capricorn.
- Capricorn, eh? What are they like?

27
00:03:00,531 --> 00:03:03,201
Well, he's the Son of God.
Our Messiah.

28
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:04,524
King of the Jews!

29
00:03:04,702 --> 00:03:07,988
- And that's Capricorn, is it?
- No, no, no, that's just him!

30
00:03:08,164 --> 00:03:11,415
I was gonna say,
otherwise there'd be a lot of them.

31
00:03:11,585 --> 00:03:15,036
- By what name are you calling him?
- Brian.

32
00:03:15,214 --> 00:03:19,377
We worship you, Brian,
who are lord over us all.

33
00:03:19,843 --> 00:03:25,004
Praise unto you, Brian,
and to the Lord, our Father. Amen.

34
00:03:25,182 --> 00:03:26,676
- Do you do a lot of this?
- What?

35
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,926
- This praising.
- No, no. No, no.

36
00:03:29,102 --> 00:03:31,973
Well, if you're dropping
by again, do pop in.

37
00:03:32,147 --> 00:03:34,852
And thanks a lot for the gold
and frankincense...

38
00:03:35,025 --> 00:03:38,192
...but don't worry too much about
the myrrh next time, all right?

39
00:03:38,362 --> 00:03:41,612
Thank you. Goodbye.

40
00:03:42,866 --> 00:03:44,859
Well, weren't they nice?

41
00:03:45,035 --> 00:03:49,329
Out of their bloody minds,
but still, look at that!

42
00:03:49,665 --> 00:03:53,745
Here. Here, that's mine! Hey! Hey!

43
00:04:08,434 --> 00:04:10,034
Shut up!

44
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:21,403
<i>Brian</i>
<i>The babe they called Brian</i>

45
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:27,542
<i>He grew</i>

46
00:04:28,037 --> 00:04:31,204
<i>Grew, grew and grew</i>

47
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:35,269
<i>Grew up to be</i>

48
00:04:35,369 --> 00:04:38,955
<i>Grew up to be</i>

49
00:04:39,055 --> 00:04:41,425
<i>A boy called Brian</i>

50
00:04:41,594 --> 00:04:46,458
<i>A boy called Brian</i>

51
00:04:46,558 --> 00:04:49,549
<i>He had arms and legs</i>

52
00:04:49,727 --> 00:04:52,977
<i>And hands and feet</i>

53
00:04:53,147 --> 00:04:56,114
<i>This boy</i>

54
00:04:56,214 --> 00:04:59,482
<i>Whose name was Brian</i>

55
00:04:59,862 --> 00:05:03,390
<i>And he grew</i>

56
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,449
<i>Grew, grew and grew</i>

57
00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:10,368
<i>Grew up to be</i>

58
00:05:10,468 --> 00:05:12,824
<i>Yes, he grew up to be</i>

59
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,535
<i>A teenager called Brian</i>

60
00:05:16,712 --> 00:05:20,211
<i>A teenager called Brian</i>

61
00:05:20,382 --> 00:05:23,586
<i>And his face became spotty</i>

62
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:27,131
<i>Yes, his face became spotty</i>

63
00:05:27,307 --> 00:05:30,972
<i>And his voice dropped down low</i>

64
00:05:31,144 --> 00:05:34,347
<i>And things started to grow</i>

65
00:05:34,523 --> 00:05:37,689
<i>On young Brian and show</i>

66
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:41,228
<i>He was certainly no</i>

67
00:05:41,404 --> 00:05:45,023
<i>No girl named Brian</i>

68
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:51,000
<i>Not a girl named Brian</i>

69
00:05:55,752 --> 00:05:59,002
<i>And he started to shave</i>

70
00:05:59,172 --> 00:06:02,173
<i>And have one off the wrist</i>

71
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:05,960
<i>And want to see girls</i>

72
00:06:06,137 --> 00:06:09,471
<i>And go out and get pissed</i>

73
00:06:09,641 --> 00:06:12,928
<i>A man called Brian</i>

74
00:06:13,104 --> 00:06:16,437
<i>This man called Brian</i>

75
00:06:16,607 --> 00:06:23,007
<i>The man they called Brian</i>

76
00:06:24,532 --> 00:06:28,835
<i>This man called</i>

77
00:06:28,935 --> 00:06:31,238
<i>Brian</i>

78
00:07:19,463 --> 00:07:22,796
How blessed are those
who know that he's of God.

79
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,338
How blessed are
the sorrowful.

80
00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:29,465
They shall find consolation.

81
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:34,509
How blessed are those of gentle spirit.

82
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,437
They shall have the earth
for their possession.

83
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:45,983
How blessed are those who hunger
and thirst to see right prevail.

84
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:49,154
They shall be satisfied.

85
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,368
How blessed are those
whose hearts are pure.

86
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,829
They shall see God.

87
00:07:57,001 --> 00:07:59,706
- Speak up!
- Quiet, mum!

88
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,964
Well, I can't hear a thing.

89
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,508
Let's go to a stoning.

90
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:09,135
- You can go to a stoning anytime.
- Come on, Brian.

91
00:08:09,347 --> 00:08:11,838
Will you be quiet?

92
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:14,051
Don't pick your nose!

93
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,686
I wasn't. I was scratching.

94
00:08:15,854 --> 00:08:18,309
You was picking it while you
was talking to that lady.

95
00:08:18,481 --> 00:08:21,435
- I wasn't!
- Leave it alone. Give it a rest.

96
00:08:21,651 --> 00:08:26,278
- Do you mind? I can't hear a word.
- Don't you "do you mind" me.

97
00:08:26,448 --> 00:08:29,200
- I was talking to my husband.
- Talk to him somewhere else.

98
00:08:29,368 --> 00:08:32,867
- I can't hear a bloody thing.
- Don't you swear at my wife.

99
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:36,324
I was only asking her to shut up
so we can hear, big nose.

100
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,789
Don't you call my husband "big nose."

101
00:08:38,961 --> 00:08:41,997
- Well, he has got a big nose.
- Could you be quiet, please?

102
00:08:42,172 --> 00:08:44,877
- What was that?
- I was too busy talking to big nose.

103
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,802
I think it was,
"Blessed are the cheese makers."

104
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,044
What's so special about
the cheese makers?

105
00:08:51,223 --> 00:08:53,180
It's not meant to be taken literally.

106
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,351
It refers to any manufacturers
of dairy products.

107
00:08:56,562 --> 00:08:59,183
If you hadn't been going on,
we'd have heard that, big nose.

108
00:08:59,356 --> 00:09:02,026
Say that once more,
I'll smash your bloody face in!

109
00:09:02,193 --> 00:09:05,193
Listen, might be a bit
about "Blessed are the big noses."

110
00:09:05,362 --> 00:09:06,738
Lay off him.

111
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:11,029
You're not so bad yourself, conk-face.
Where are you two from? Nose City?

112
00:09:11,661 --> 00:09:14,366
One more time,
I'll take you to the fucking cleaners!

113
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:16,339
Language!

114
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,998
And don't pick your nose!

115
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:21,245
I wasn't going to.
I was gonna thump him!

116
00:09:21,463 --> 00:09:23,171
Hear that? Blessed are the Greek.

117
00:09:23,381 --> 00:09:26,833
- The Greek?
- Apparently, he's gonna inherit the earth.

118
00:09:27,052 --> 00:09:29,756
- Did anyone catch his name?
- You won't thump anybody.

119
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,762
- I'll thump him if he calls me "big nose"!
- Shut up, big nose!

120
00:09:33,934 --> 00:09:35,807
Right. I warned you.

121
00:09:35,977 --> 00:09:37,934
I really will slug you so hard...!

122
00:09:38,104 --> 00:09:41,355
It's the meek.
"Blessed are the meek."

123
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:45,569
That's nice, isn't it? I'm glad they getting
something. They have a hell of a time.

124
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:49,230
Listen, I'm only telling the truth,
you have got a very big nose.

125
00:09:49,407 --> 00:09:54,154
Your nose is going to be three foot wide
across your face by the time I'm finished!

126
00:09:55,373 --> 00:09:57,200
Who hit yours? Goliath's big brother?

127
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,664
- Right, that's your last warning.
- Do pipe down.

128
00:10:03,381 --> 00:10:06,584
Silly bitch, getting in the way.

129
00:10:08,177 --> 00:10:09,256
Break it up!

130
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,471
- Come on, let's go to the stoning.
- All right.

131
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:21,014
Blessed is just about everyone with an
interest in the status quo, right, Reg?

132
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:25,603
What Jesus blatantly fails to appreciate
is it's the meek who are the problem.

133
00:10:25,778 --> 00:10:30,239
Yes, yes. Absolutely, Reg. Yes, I see.

134
00:10:30,616 --> 00:10:34,116
Come on, Brian, or they'll have
stoned him before we get there.

135
00:10:34,287 --> 00:10:35,864
All right.

136
00:10:36,038 --> 00:10:40,203
Hey, get off her. That's disgusting.
Officer, intervene here.

137
00:10:40,377 --> 00:10:45,205
Attempted rape going on. It's the chap
with the big nose's fault. He started it all.

138
00:10:45,507 --> 00:10:47,963
I hate wearing these beards.

139
00:10:48,135 --> 00:10:52,085
- Why aren't women allowed at stonings?
- It's written, that's why.

140
00:10:53,724 --> 00:10:57,258
- Beard, madam?
- I haven't got time to go to no stonings.

141
00:10:57,436 --> 00:11:00,141
He's not well again.

142
00:11:00,522 --> 00:11:04,022
- Stone, sir?
- They've got them lying on the ground.

143
00:11:04,193 --> 00:11:09,269
Not like these, sir. Look at this. Feel
the quality of that. That's craftsmanship.

144
00:11:10,365 --> 00:11:13,402
All right. We'll have two with points
and a big, flat one.

145
00:11:13,577 --> 00:11:15,404
Could I have a flat one, Mum?

146
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:16,777
Sorry. Dad.

147
00:11:16,955 --> 00:11:20,371
All right. Two points, two flats
and a packet of gravel.

148
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:21,740
Packet of gravel.

149
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,627
Should be a good one this afternoon.

150
00:11:23,795 --> 00:11:25,207
- Local boy.
- Oh, good.

151
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:26,621
Enjoy yourselves.

152
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,314
Matthias, son of
Deuteronomy of Gath...

153
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:50,646
- Do I say yes?
- Yes!

154
00:11:50,865 --> 00:11:54,483
...you have been found guilty
by the elders of the town...

155
00:11:54,661 --> 00:11:57,531
...of uttering the name of our Lord...

156
00:11:57,705 --> 00:12:00,457
...and so as a blasphemer...

157
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,459
...you are to be stoned to death!

158
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,499
Look, I'd had a lovely supper,
and all I said to my wife was:

159
00:12:09,677 --> 00:12:13,674
"That piece of halibut was
good enough for Jehovah."

160
00:12:13,847 --> 00:12:17,216
Blasphemy! He said it again!

161
00:12:17,685 --> 00:12:20,389
- Did you hear him?
- Yeah! Yes, we did!

162
00:12:20,563 --> 00:12:21,808
Really.

163
00:12:25,985 --> 00:12:27,942
Are there any women here today?

164
00:12:33,951 --> 00:12:37,284
Very well. By virtue of the authority...

165
00:12:37,496 --> 00:12:38,611
...vested in me...

166
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:41,743
Lay off! We haven't started yet.

167
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:44,587
Come on! Who threw that?

168
00:12:45,504 --> 00:12:47,497
Who threw that stone? Come on!

169
00:12:47,673 --> 00:12:49,666
She did! She did!

170
00:12:49,842 --> 00:12:52,333
He did! He did! He did!

171
00:12:52,511 --> 00:12:54,635
Sorry, I thought we'd started.

172
00:12:54,848 --> 00:12:57,303
- Go to the back.
- Oh, dear.

173
00:12:57,475 --> 00:13:00,393
Always one, isn't there?

174
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:03,978
- Now, where were we?
- I don't think it ought to be blasphemy...

175
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:07,399
...just saying "Jehovah."
- He did! He did!

176
00:13:07,611 --> 00:13:09,769
You're only making it worse for yourself!

177
00:13:09,946 --> 00:13:12,520
Making it worse?!
How could it be worse?

178
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:15,237
Jehovah! Jehovah! Jehovah!

179
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:19,028
I'm warning you!
If you say Jehovah once more...

180
00:13:19,206 --> 00:13:21,661
Right! Who threw that?

181
00:13:23,293 --> 00:13:25,369
Come on! Who threw that?

182
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,871
Him! Him! Him!

183
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,544
- Was it you?
- Yes.

184
00:13:31,885 --> 00:13:34,376
- Right...
- Well, you did say Jehovah.

185
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,843
Stop. Stop. Will you stop that?

186
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,063
Stop it!

187
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:47,935
Now, look. No one is to stone
anyone until I blow this whistle.

188
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,486
Do you understand?

189
00:13:49,654 --> 00:13:52,987
Even, and I want to
make this absolutely clear...

190
00:13:53,157 --> 00:13:56,277
...even if they do say Jehovah.

191
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,792
Good shot!

192
00:14:15,012 --> 00:14:18,512
- Have I got a big nose, mum?
- Stop thinking about sex.

193
00:14:18,683 --> 00:14:20,592
- I wasn't.
- You're always on about it.

194
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:22,143
Morning, noon and night.

195
00:14:22,311 --> 00:14:24,886
"Will the girls like this,
will the girls like that?

196
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:28,101
Is it too big, is it too small?"

197
00:14:31,154 --> 00:14:33,942
- Alms for a leper.
- Alms for a leper.

198
00:14:34,116 --> 00:14:36,689
Alms for an ex-leper.

199
00:14:36,869 --> 00:14:40,783
Bloody donkey-owners, all the same,
ain't they? Never have any change.

200
00:14:40,956 --> 00:14:42,450
Here's a touch.

201
00:14:42,624 --> 00:14:45,791
- Spare a talent for an old ex-leper?
- Buzz off.

202
00:14:45,961 --> 00:14:47,752
Spare a talent for an old ex-leper?

203
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:50,246
A talent? That's more than
he earns in a month.

204
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:52,297
- Half a talent then?
- No, go away.

205
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:53,878
- Big nose, let's haggle.
- What?

206
00:14:54,052 --> 00:14:58,880
All right, let's say you open at one
shekel, I start at 2000, we close at 1800.

207
00:14:59,057 --> 00:15:00,100
- No.
- 1750?

208
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:01,809
- Go away!
- 1740?

209
00:15:01,977 --> 00:15:04,646
- Leave him alone.
- All right. Two shekels, just two.

210
00:15:04,813 --> 00:15:07,849
- Is this fun, eh?
- Look, he's not giving you any money.

211
00:15:08,025 --> 00:15:10,433
Now piss off!

212
00:15:13,656 --> 00:15:16,194
All right, final offer,
half a shekel for an ex-leper?

213
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:18,823
- Did you say ex-leper?
- That's right, sir.

214
00:15:18,995 --> 00:15:20,869
Sixteen years behind
a bell and proud of it.

215
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,369
- Well, what happened?
- I was cured, sir.

216
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:26,211
- Cured?
- A bloody miracle, sir. God bless you.

217
00:15:26,377 --> 00:15:28,833
- Who cured you?
- Jesus did, sir.

218
00:15:29,005 --> 00:15:31,081
I was hopping along,
minding my own business.

219
00:15:31,257 --> 00:15:33,582
All of a sudden, up he comes, cures me.

220
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,054
One minute I'm a leper with a trade,
next minute my livelihood's gone.

221
00:15:38,223 --> 00:15:40,760
"You're cured, mate."
Bloody do-gooder.

222
00:15:40,975 --> 00:15:44,427
Well, why don't you go and tell him
that you want to be a leper again?

223
00:15:44,604 --> 00:15:46,727
I could do that sir.
I could, I suppose.

224
00:15:46,898 --> 00:15:50,682
I was gonna ask him if he'd make me
a bit lame in one leg during the week.

225
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,693
You know, something beggable, but
not leprosy, which is a pain in the ass.

226
00:15:54,865 --> 00:15:57,487
Brian. Come and clean your room out.

227
00:15:58,953 --> 00:16:00,577
- There you are.
- Thank you. Thank...

228
00:16:00,746 --> 00:16:05,788
- Half a dinare for me bloody life story?
- There's no pleasing some people.

229
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,118
That's just what Jesus said, sir.

230
00:16:21,141 --> 00:16:22,766
Good afternoon.

231
00:16:23,644 --> 00:16:25,683
Hello, officer.

232
00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:29,058
I'll be with you in a few
moments, all right, dear?

233
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:30,478
What's he doing here?

234
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:34,269
- Don't start, Brian. Go clean your room.
- Bloody Romans.

235
00:16:34,446 --> 00:16:37,732
Now, look, Brian. If it wasn't for them,
we wouldn't have all this.

236
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:41,492
- And don't you forget it.
- We don't owe the Romans anything.

237
00:16:41,663 --> 00:16:44,154
That's not entirely true, is it, Brian?

238
00:16:44,332 --> 00:16:45,375
What do you mean?

239
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:48,543
Well, you know when you
were asking me about your?

240
00:16:48,712 --> 00:16:52,579
- My nose?
- Yes, well, there's a reason it's like it is.

241
00:16:52,757 --> 00:16:54,335
What is it?

242
00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:58,589
Well, I suppose I should have
told you a long time ago, but...

243
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,887
Well, Brian...

244
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:05,183
...your father isn't Mr. Cohen.
- I never thought he was.

245
00:17:05,353 --> 00:17:07,061
Now, none of your cheek!

246
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,804
He was a Roman, Brian.

247
00:17:09,983 --> 00:17:12,604
He was a centurion in the Roman army.

248
00:17:12,777 --> 00:17:16,941
- You mean you were raped?!
- Well, at first, yes.

249
00:17:17,115 --> 00:17:21,029
- Who was it?
- Naughtius Maximus his name was.

250
00:17:21,286 --> 00:17:23,529
Promised me the known world,
he did.

251
00:17:23,706 --> 00:17:26,624
I was to be taken to Rome,
house by the Forum...

252
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:28,785
...slaves, asses' milk...

253
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:31,287
...as much gold as I could eat.

254
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:35,752
Then he, having his way with me he had:
Like a rat out of an aqueduct.

255
00:17:35,927 --> 00:17:37,172
The bastard.

256
00:17:37,345 --> 00:17:40,464
Yes, and next time you go on
about the "bloody Romans"...

257
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,973
...don't forget you're one of them.
- I'm not a Roman, Mum.

258
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:48,473
And I never will be.
I'm a kike, a yid, a hebe, a hooknose.

259
00:17:48,648 --> 00:17:53,523
I'm kosher, Mum. I'm a Red Sea
pedestrian and proud of it!

260
00:17:57,573 --> 00:18:00,740
Sex, sex, sex, that's all
they think about, huh?

261
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,615
Well, how are you then, officer?

262
00:18:21,265 --> 00:18:27,219
Ladies and gentlemen,
the next contest is between...

263
00:18:27,396 --> 00:18:32,307
...Frank Goliath,
the Macedonian baby-crusher...

264
00:18:32,484 --> 00:18:36,185
...and Boris Mineburg.

265
00:18:36,363 --> 00:18:37,905
Thank you, madam.

266
00:18:38,115 --> 00:18:41,116
Larks' tongues. Wrens' livers.

267
00:18:41,285 --> 00:18:45,532
Chaffinch brains.
Jaguars' earlobes.

268
00:18:45,706 --> 00:18:48,410
Wolf-nipple chips.
Get them while they're hot. They're lovely.

269
00:18:48,584 --> 00:18:52,166
Dromedary pretzels, only half a dinar.
Tuscany fried bats...

270
00:18:52,337 --> 00:18:56,170
I do feel, Reg, that any
anti-imperialist group like ours...

271
00:18:56,342 --> 00:19:00,174
...must reflect such a divergence
of interest within its power base.

272
00:19:00,346 --> 00:19:04,047
- Agreed. Francis?
- Judith's point of view is very valid...

273
00:19:04,225 --> 00:19:08,140
...provided the movement never forgets
it is the unalienable right of every man...

274
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,641
- Or woman.
...or woman...

275
00:19:09,814 --> 00:19:11,522
...to rid himself...
- Or herself.

276
00:19:11,691 --> 00:19:12,770
- Agreed.
- Thanks, brother.

277
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:15,267
- Or sister.
- Or sister...

278
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,814
Where was I?

279
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,939
- I think you finished.
- Right.

280
00:19:21,117 --> 00:19:24,568
- It is the birthright of every man...
- Or woman.

281
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:27,153
Shut up about women, Stan.
You're putting us off.

282
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,119
Women have a perfect right to play
a part in our movement.

283
00:19:30,376 --> 00:19:32,369
Why are you always
on about women, Stan?

284
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,122
I want to be one.

285
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,216
What?

286
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,924
I want to be a woman.

287
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:44,556
From now on, I want you
all to call me Loretta.

288
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,761
- What?
- It's my right as a man.

289
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:51,769
Well, why do you want
to be Loretta, Stan?

290
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,391
I want to have babies.

291
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,276
You want to have babies?!

292
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,114
It's every man's right to have
babies if he wants them.

293
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,401
- But you can't have babies.
- Don't you oppress me.

294
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:06,076
I'm not oppressing you, Stan.
You haven't got a womb.

295
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:10,659
Where's the fetus gonna gestate?
You gonna keep it in a box?

296
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:18,249
Here, I've got an idea. Suppose you agree
that he can't actually have babies...

297
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,841
...not having a womb, which is nobody's
fault, not even the Romans'...

298
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:26,177
...but he has the right to have babies.
- Good idea, Judith.

299
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:30,515
We shall fight the oppressors for your
right to have babies, brother. Sister.

300
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:33,061
- What's the point?
- What?

301
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:38,689
Why fight for his right to have babies
when he can't have babies?

302
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:43,908
It is symbolic of our struggle
against oppression.

303
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:47,497
Symbolic of his struggle
against reality.

304
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:57,375
- Get out there. Get out.
- It's dangerous out there.

305
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:24,034
Larks' tongues. Otters' noses.
Ocelots' spleens.

306
00:21:24,202 --> 00:21:25,945
- Got any nuts?
- Haven't got any nuts.

307
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,738
- I've got wrens' livers, badgers' spleens...
- No, no, no.

308
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,407
- Otters' noses?
- I don't want any Roman rubbish.

309
00:21:32,585 --> 00:21:35,669
- Why don't you sell proper food?
- Proper food?

310
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:41,508
- Yeah, not those rich imperialist tidbits.
- Don't blame me. I didn't ask to sell this.

311
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:44,299
- All right, bag of otters' noses, then.
- Make it two.

312
00:21:44,472 --> 00:21:46,678
- Two.
- Thanks, Reg.

313
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:49,471
- Are you the Judean People's Front?
- Fuck off.

314
00:21:49,685 --> 00:21:53,518
- What?
- Judean People's Front.

315
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,932
We're The People's Front of Judea.

316
00:21:56,151 --> 00:21:59,816
- Judean People's Front, God!
- Wankers.

317
00:22:02,115 --> 00:22:05,200
- Can I join your group?
- No, piss off.

318
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:10,452
I didn't want to sell this. It's only a job.
I hate the Romans as much as anybody.

319
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,491
- Are you sure?
- Dead sure.

320
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,330
I hate the Romans already.

321
00:22:16,547 --> 00:22:22,632
Listen, if you wanted to join the PFJ,
you'd have to really hate the Romans.

322
00:22:22,803 --> 00:22:23,803
I do.

323
00:22:24,638 --> 00:22:27,888
- Oh, yeah, how much?
- A lot.

324
00:22:30,352 --> 00:22:32,345
Right, you're in. Listen...

325
00:22:32,938 --> 00:22:37,352
...the only people we hate more than
Romans are the Judean People's Front.

326
00:22:37,527 --> 00:22:40,611
- Splitters.
- And the Judean Popular People's Front.

327
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,108
- Oh, yeah.
- Splitters.

328
00:22:42,282 --> 00:22:44,951
- And the People's Front of Judea.
- Yeah. Splitters.

329
00:22:45,118 --> 00:22:47,573
- What?
- The People's Front of Judea. Splitters.

330
00:22:47,745 --> 00:22:50,581
We're the People's Front of Judea.

331
00:22:50,748 --> 00:22:55,541
- I thought we were the Popular Front.
- People's Front.

332
00:22:55,712 --> 00:22:58,748
Whatever happened
to the Popular Front, Reg?

333
00:22:58,923 --> 00:23:00,086
He's over there.

334
00:23:02,969 --> 00:23:04,769
Splitter!

335
00:23:12,604 --> 00:23:16,436
I think I'm about to have
a cardiac arrest.

336
00:23:17,567 --> 00:23:19,476
Absolutely dreadful.

337
00:23:34,877 --> 00:23:38,293
- What's your name?
- Brian. Brian Cohen.

338
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:42,589
We may have a little job for you, Brian.

339
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:41,058
What's this then?
<i>"Romanes eunt domus"?</i>

340
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:44,362
"People called Romanes,
they go the house"?

341
00:24:44,531 --> 00:24:47,152
It says, "Romans go home."

342
00:24:47,325 --> 00:24:50,659
No, it doesn't. What's Latin for Roman?

343
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:52,490
- Come on.
<i>- Romanus?</i>

344
00:24:52,665 --> 00:24:53,993
- Goes like?
<i>- Anus?</i>

345
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:56,788
Vocative plural of <i>anus</i> is?

346
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:59,997
<i>- Ani?</i>
<i>- Romani.</i>

347
00:25:00,256 --> 00:25:02,628
- <i>"Eunt"?</i> What is <i>eunt?</i>
- Go.

348
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:08,139
- Conjugate the verb "to go."
<i>- Ere, eo, is, it, imus, itis, eunt.</i>

349
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:10,179
So <i>eunt</i> is?

350
00:25:10,349 --> 00:25:13,019
Third person plural, present indicative.
"They go."

351
00:25:13,185 --> 00:25:18,262
But "Romans go home" is an order,
so you must use the?

352
00:25:18,441 --> 00:25:20,813
- Imperative!
- Which is?

353
00:25:21,777 --> 00:25:23,984
- Oh, <i>- i.</i>
- How many Romans?

354
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:27,939
- Plural, plural. <i>Ite. Ite.</i>
<i>- Ite.</i>

355
00:25:28,743 --> 00:25:31,412
<i>Domus?</i> Nominative?

356
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:35,446
"Go home." This is motion
towards, isn't it, boy?

357
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:39,326
Dative! Not dative,
not the dative, sir!

358
00:25:40,214 --> 00:25:43,084
The accusative! Accusative!
<i>Domum,</i> sir. <i>Ad domum.</i>

359
00:25:43,258 --> 00:25:46,129
- Except that <i>domus</i> takes the?
- The locative, sir.

360
00:25:46,303 --> 00:25:47,466
- Which is?
<i>- Domum!</i>

361
00:25:47,638 --> 00:25:50,238
<i>Domum.</i>

362
00:25:52,434 --> 00:25:53,597
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

363
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:56,972
- Write that 100 times.
- Yes, sir. Thank you. Hail Caesar.

364
00:25:57,147 --> 00:25:59,899
If it's not done by sunrise,
I'll cut your balls off.

365
00:26:00,108 --> 00:26:03,394
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.
Hail Caesar and everything, sir.

366
00:26:25,885 --> 00:26:27,685
Finished.

367
00:26:28,388 --> 00:26:33,465
Right. Now, don't do it again.

368
00:26:56,249 --> 00:26:57,529
Hey. Bloody Romans.

369
00:27:32,745 --> 00:27:35,200
We get in through the underground
heating-system...

370
00:27:35,372 --> 00:27:38,042
...up through into the main
audience chamber here...

371
00:27:38,209 --> 00:27:40,746
...and Pilate's wife's bedroom is here.

372
00:27:41,295 --> 00:27:43,703
Having grabbed his wife,
we inform Pilate...

373
00:27:43,881 --> 00:27:47,581
...that she is in our custody,
and forthwith issue our demands.

374
00:27:47,801 --> 00:27:50,257
- Any questions?
- What exactly are the demands?

375
00:27:50,471 --> 00:27:55,015
We're giving Pilate two days to dismantle
the entire Roman imperialist state...

376
00:27:55,185 --> 00:27:57,806
...and if he doesn't agree
immediately, we execute her.

377
00:27:57,979 --> 00:28:00,186
- Cut her head off?
- Cut all her bits off.

378
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:03,814
Send them back on the hour, every hour.
Show them we're not to be trifled with.

379
00:28:04,027 --> 00:28:08,819
And of course, we point out that they bear
full responsibility when we chop her up...

380
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:12,406
...and that we shall not
submit to blackmail.

381
00:28:12,619 --> 00:28:14,446
No blackmail!

382
00:28:14,621 --> 00:28:18,488
They've bled us white, the bastards.
They've taken everything we had.

383
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:22,124
And not just from us! From our fathers,
and from our fathers' fathers.

384
00:28:22,295 --> 00:28:24,502
- And from our fathers' fathers' fathers.
- Yeah.

385
00:28:24,673 --> 00:28:28,622
- And our fathers' fathers' fathers' fathers.
- All right, don't labour the point.

386
00:28:28,802 --> 00:28:32,005
And what have they ever
given us in return?

387
00:28:33,974 --> 00:28:35,598
The aqueduct?

388
00:28:36,227 --> 00:28:38,266
- What?
- The aqueduct.

389
00:28:38,437 --> 00:28:41,107
Yeah, they did give us that.
That's true, yeah.

390
00:28:41,274 --> 00:28:43,266
And the sanitation.

391
00:28:43,442 --> 00:28:46,776
Yeah, the sanitation, Reg.
Remember what the city used to be like.

392
00:28:46,946 --> 00:28:51,026
I'll grant you the aqueduct and sanitation,
the two things the Romans have done.

393
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,691
- And the roads.
- Yeah, obviously the roads.

394
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:56,195
I mean the roads go
without saying, don't they?

395
00:28:56,372 --> 00:28:58,661
But apart from sanitation,
aqueduct and roads...

396
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:01,240
- Irrigation.
- Medicine.

397
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:04,088
- Education.
- Yeah, yeah, all right, fair enough.

398
00:29:04,297 --> 00:29:06,289
And the wine.

399
00:29:07,425 --> 00:29:10,342
That's something we'd really miss, Reg,
if the Romans left.

400
00:29:10,511 --> 00:29:11,674
Public baths.

401
00:29:11,846 --> 00:29:14,135
It's safe to walk in the streets
at night now.

402
00:29:14,307 --> 00:29:15,635
They know how to keep order.

403
00:29:15,808 --> 00:29:19,307
Let's face it, they're the only ones
who could in a place like this.

404
00:29:20,521 --> 00:29:25,231
All right, but apart from sanitation,
medicine, education, wine, public order...

405
00:29:25,402 --> 00:29:29,020
...irrigation, roads, the fresh-water
system and public health...

406
00:29:29,197 --> 00:29:32,649
...what have the Romans
ever done for us?

407
00:29:32,826 --> 00:29:37,951
- Brought peace?
- Peace. Shut up!

408
00:29:47,716 --> 00:29:52,425
I'm a poor man. My sight is poor.
My legs are old and bented.

409
00:29:52,596 --> 00:29:57,009
- It's all right, Matthias.
- It's all clear.

410
00:30:04,316 --> 00:30:06,475
Well, where's Reg?

411
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:10,861
Reg. Reg. It's Judith.

412
00:30:11,032 --> 00:30:14,650
- What went wrong?
- The first blow has been struck.

413
00:30:14,994 --> 00:30:17,746
- Did he finish the slogan?
- 100 times.

414
00:30:17,914 --> 00:30:21,994
In letters 10 foot high,
all the way around the palace.

415
00:30:22,168 --> 00:30:24,077
Oh, great.

416
00:30:24,254 --> 00:30:29,959
Great. We need doers in our movement,
Brian, but before you join us, know this:

417
00:30:30,134 --> 00:30:32,542
There is not one of us who would not
gladly die...

418
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,093
...to rid this country of the Romans.

419
00:30:35,265 --> 00:30:37,257
Well, one.

420
00:30:37,433 --> 00:30:41,217
Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's one. But
otherwise, we're solid. Are you with us?

421
00:30:41,563 --> 00:30:42,563
Yes.

422
00:30:44,274 --> 00:30:48,982
From now on, you shall be called,
"Brian, that is called Brian."

423
00:30:49,153 --> 00:30:51,443
Tell him about the raid
on Pilate's palace, Francis.

424
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:53,857
Right. This is the plan:

425
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:57,532
<i>Now, this is the palace</i>
<i>in Caesar's Square.</i>

426
00:30:57,746 --> 00:31:00,451
<i>Our commando unit will approach</i>
<i>from Fish Street...</i>

427
00:31:00,833 --> 00:31:03,917
<i>... and make our way</i>
<i>to the northwestern main drain.</i>

428
00:31:04,086 --> 00:31:08,499
<i>If questioned, we are sewage workers</i>
<i>on our way to a conference.</i>

429
00:31:08,674 --> 00:31:11,841
<i>Reg, our glorious leader</i>
<i>and founder of the PFJ...</i>

430
00:31:12,011 --> 00:31:15,462
<i>... will be coordinating consultant</i>
<i>at the drain head...</i>

431
00:31:15,639 --> 00:31:20,135
<i>... though he will not be taking part in any</i>
<i>terrorist action, as he has a bad back.</i>

432
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,884
- Aren't you gonna come with us?
- Solidarity, brother.

433
00:31:23,063 --> 00:31:25,768
Oh, yes. Solidarity, Reg.

434
00:31:25,941 --> 00:31:28,978
<i>Once in the sewer,</i>
<i>timing will be of the essence.</i>

435
00:31:29,194 --> 00:31:31,982
<i>There is a Roman feast later,</i>
<i>so we must move fast...</i>

436
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:34,611
<i>... and don't wear your best sandals.</i>

437
00:31:34,783 --> 00:31:38,948
<i>Turning left here, we enter</i>
<i>the Caesar Augustus Memorial Sewer.</i>

438
00:31:39,122 --> 00:31:41,660
<i>And from there proceed directly</i>
<i>to the hypocaust.</i>

439
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:46,875
<i>This has just been re-tiled.</i>
<i>So terrorists, careful with those weapons.</i>

440
00:31:47,047 --> 00:31:50,546
<i>We will now be directly beneath</i>
<i>Pilate's audience chamber itself.</i>

441
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:54,756
<i>This is the moment</i>
<i>for Habakkuk to get out his prong.</i>

442
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,754
Campaign for Free Galilee.

443
00:33:16,763 --> 00:33:18,922
People's Front of Judea. Officials.

444
00:33:20,726 --> 00:33:24,593
- What's your group doing here?
- We're gonna kidnap Pilate's wife.

445
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:26,052
- So are we.
- What?

446
00:33:26,231 --> 00:33:27,891
That's our plan.

447
00:33:28,108 --> 00:33:29,982
- We were here first.
- What do you mean?

448
00:33:30,152 --> 00:33:32,026
- We thought of it first.
- Oh, yeah?

449
00:33:32,195 --> 00:33:34,318
Yes, a couple of years ago.

450
00:33:34,489 --> 00:33:37,407
- We did.
- You got all your demands worked out?

451
00:33:37,576 --> 00:33:39,568
- Of course we have.
- What are they?

452
00:33:39,745 --> 00:33:42,200
- Well, I'm not telling you.
- Pull the other one.

453
00:33:42,372 --> 00:33:44,863
That's not the point.
We thought of it before you.

454
00:33:45,042 --> 00:33:46,084
- Did not.
- We did.

455
00:33:46,251 --> 00:33:48,493
- You didn't.
- We bloody did!

456
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,830
Bastards, we've been
planning this for months.

457
00:33:51,007 --> 00:33:53,046
Well, tough titty for you, fish-face.

458
00:33:53,218 --> 00:33:55,044
- All right.
- Why you sly...

459
00:33:55,261 --> 00:33:57,931
Brothers! Brothers!
We should be struggling together!

460
00:33:58,139 --> 00:33:59,539
We are.

461
00:34:00,433 --> 00:34:01,713
We mustn't fight each other!

462
00:34:01,893 --> 00:34:05,060
Surely, we should be united
against the common enemy!

463
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,354
The Judean People's Front?!

464
00:34:07,523 --> 00:34:10,145
No, no, the Romans!

465
00:34:10,318 --> 00:34:12,607
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes.

466
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,315
- Yeah, he's right.
- Look out!

467
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,130
Careful.

468
00:34:21,287 --> 00:34:23,410
- Right! Where were we?
- You were gonna punch me.

469
00:34:23,581 --> 00:34:24,862
Oh, yeah!

470
00:34:47,982 --> 00:34:49,773
Brothers!

471
00:34:49,942 --> 00:34:51,542
Get off!

472
00:35:51,588 --> 00:35:55,206
- You lucky bastard.
- Who's that?

473
00:35:55,383 --> 00:35:58,717
- You lucky, lucky bastard.
- What?

474
00:35:58,887 --> 00:36:02,090
- Proper little jailer's pet, aren't we?
- What do you mean?

475
00:36:02,265 --> 00:36:04,804
You must have slipped him
a few shekels, eh?

476
00:36:05,019 --> 00:36:07,936
Slipped him a few shekels?
You saw him spit in my face!

477
00:36:08,147 --> 00:36:12,097
What wouldn't I give
to be spat at in the face?

478
00:36:12,276 --> 00:36:16,938
I sometimes hang awake at night,
dreaming of being spat at in the face.

479
00:36:17,156 --> 00:36:19,908
Well, it's not exactly friendly.
They had me in manacles!

480
00:36:20,117 --> 00:36:21,917
Manacles!

481
00:36:22,745 --> 00:36:24,025
My idea of heaven...

482
00:36:24,205 --> 00:36:28,333
...is to be allowed to be put in manacles
just for a few hours.

483
00:36:28,542 --> 00:36:32,587
They must think the sun shines
out of your arse, sonny.

484
00:36:32,797 --> 00:36:34,670
Lay off me, I've had a hard time!

485
00:36:34,882 --> 00:36:37,753
You've had a hard time?
I've been here five years...

486
00:36:37,927 --> 00:36:41,378
...they only hung me the right way up
yesterday! So don't you come around...

487
00:36:41,597 --> 00:36:42,842
All right, all right.

488
00:36:43,391 --> 00:36:47,685
They must think
you're Lord God almighty.

489
00:36:47,853 --> 00:36:51,603
- What will they do to me?
- You'll probably get away with crucifixion.

490
00:36:51,942 --> 00:36:54,729
- Crucifixion?!
- Yeah. First offence.

491
00:36:54,945 --> 00:36:58,859
- Get away with crucifixion?! It's...
- Best thing the Romans ever did for us.

492
00:36:59,032 --> 00:37:00,230
- What?!
- Oh, yeah.

493
00:37:00,409 --> 00:37:03,279
If we didn't have crucifixion,
this country would be a mess.

494
00:37:03,662 --> 00:37:06,283
- Guard!
- Nail them up, I say!

495
00:37:06,498 --> 00:37:09,452
- Guard!
- Nail some sense into them!

496
00:37:10,252 --> 00:37:14,830
- What do you want?
- I want you to move me to another cell.

497
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:18,335
Oh, look at that! Bloody favouritism!

498
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:21,292
- Shut up, you.
- Sorry.

499
00:37:24,433 --> 00:37:27,054
Now, take my case.
They hung me up here five years ago.

500
00:37:27,227 --> 00:37:29,386
Every night they take me down
for 20 minutes...

501
00:37:29,563 --> 00:37:30,843
...then they hang me up again.

502
00:37:31,023 --> 00:37:33,774
Which I regard as very fair
in view of what I've done.

503
00:37:34,193 --> 00:37:38,772
And if nothing else, it's taught me
to respect the Romans...

504
00:37:38,948 --> 00:37:42,483
...and it's taught me that
you'll never get anywhere in this life...

505
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:47,121
...unless you are prepared to do
a fair day's work for a fair day's...

506
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:48,932
Shut up!

507
00:37:51,377 --> 00:37:53,536
- Pilate wants to see you!
- Me?

508
00:37:53,755 --> 00:37:56,709
- Come on!
- Pilate? What does he want to see me for?

509
00:37:56,883 --> 00:38:00,583
I think he wants to know which
way you ought to be crucified.

510
00:38:02,138 --> 00:38:04,890
- Nice one, centurion. Like it, like it.
- Shut up!

511
00:38:05,391 --> 00:38:07,135
Right. Right.

512
00:38:08,269 --> 00:38:12,018
Terrific race, the Romans. Terrific.

513
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:30,995
- Hail Caesar.
- Hail.

514
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:33,457
Only one survivor, sir.

515
00:38:33,629 --> 00:38:35,420
Throw him to the floor.

516
00:38:35,589 --> 00:38:39,504
- What, sir?
- Throw him to the floor.

517
00:38:43,514 --> 00:38:46,717
Now, what is your name, Jew?

518
00:38:47,351 --> 00:38:49,723
- Brian, sir.
- Brian, eh?

519
00:38:49,937 --> 00:38:51,728
No, no, Brian.

520
00:38:54,441 --> 00:38:56,979
The little rascal has spirit.

521
00:38:57,152 --> 00:38:59,110
- Has what, sir?
- Spirit.

522
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,272
Yes, he did, sir.

523
00:39:01,448 --> 00:39:06,657
No, no, spirit.
Bravado, a touch of derring-do.

524
00:39:07,289 --> 00:39:10,089
About 11, sir.

525
00:39:11,167 --> 00:39:12,167
So...

526
00:39:13,545 --> 00:39:16,118
- You dare to raid us?
- To what, sir?

527
00:39:16,298 --> 00:39:20,082
Strike him, centurion, very roughly.

528
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,929
And throw him to the floor, sir?

529
00:39:23,096 --> 00:39:25,089
- What?
- Throw him to the floor again, sir?

530
00:39:25,265 --> 00:39:28,515
Oh, yes. Throw him to the floor, please.

531
00:39:30,061 --> 00:39:33,347
Now, Jewish rapscallion...

532
00:39:33,732 --> 00:39:35,559
I'm not Jewish, I'm a Roman.

533
00:39:35,984 --> 00:39:38,522
- A Roman?
- No, no, Roman.

534
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:44,029
So your father was a Roman?

535
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,659
Who was he?

536
00:39:45,827 --> 00:39:49,696
He was a centurion
in the Jerusalem garrison, sir.

537
00:39:49,874 --> 00:39:51,274
Really?

538
00:39:51,709 --> 00:39:56,205
- What was his name?
- Naughtius Maximus.

539
00:39:58,841 --> 00:40:02,886
Centurion, do you have anyone
of that name in the garrison?

540
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,964
Well, no, sir.

541
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:08,010
Well, you sound very sure.
Have you checked?

542
00:40:08,184 --> 00:40:11,968
Well, no, sir. I think it's a joke, sir.

543
00:40:12,146 --> 00:40:17,603
Like "Sillius Soddus"
or "Biggus Dickus," sir.

544
00:40:17,902 --> 00:40:22,315
What's so funny about Biggus Dickus?

545
00:40:22,698 --> 00:40:25,569
Well, it's a joke name, sir.

546
00:40:26,244 --> 00:40:30,193
I have a very great friend in Rome
called Biggus Dickus.

547
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:34,913
Silence! What is all this insolence?

548
00:40:35,087 --> 00:40:38,456
You will find yourself
in gladiator school very quickly...

549
00:40:38,632 --> 00:40:40,459
...with rotten behaviour like that.

550
00:40:40,676 --> 00:40:43,380
Can I go now, sir?

551
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,135
Wait till Biggus Dickus hears of this.

552
00:40:47,307 --> 00:40:50,427
- Right! Take him away!
- Sir, he...

553
00:40:50,602 --> 00:40:53,603
No, no, I want him fighting
rabid wild animals within a week!

554
00:40:53,772 --> 00:40:57,188
Yes, sir. Come on, you.

555
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:05,361
I will not have my friends ridiculed
by the common soldiery!

556
00:41:07,244 --> 00:41:10,529
Anybody else feel like a little...

557
00:41:10,706 --> 00:41:12,200
...giggle...

558
00:41:12,374 --> 00:41:15,541
...when I mention my friend...

559
00:41:16,003 --> 00:41:17,995
...Biggus...

560
00:41:19,257 --> 00:41:21,166
...Dickus?

561
00:41:24,429 --> 00:41:25,923
And what about you?

562
00:41:26,097 --> 00:41:29,548
Do you find it risible...

563
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:34,638
...when I say the name...

564
00:41:34,814 --> 00:41:36,854
...Biggus...

565
00:41:38,151 --> 00:41:40,060
...Dickus?

566
00:41:58,671 --> 00:42:01,957
He has a wife, you know.

567
00:42:02,508 --> 00:42:05,546
You know what she's called?

568
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,597
She's called...

569
00:42:09,767 --> 00:42:12,139
...Incontinentia.

570
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:16,602
Incontinentia Buttocks. Shut up!

571
00:42:16,774 --> 00:42:18,351
What is all this?

572
00:42:18,525 --> 00:42:22,108
I've had enough of this rowdy-rebel,
sniggering behaviour!

573
00:42:22,279 --> 00:42:25,529
Silence!
You call yourselves centurion guards?

574
00:42:25,741 --> 00:42:29,406
Seize him! Seize him!
Blow your noses and seize him!

575
00:44:27,157 --> 00:44:30,692
You lucky bastard.

576
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,797
And the beast's head
shall be huge and black...

577
00:44:48,971 --> 00:44:53,514
...and the eyes. They're of red,
with the blood of living creatures!

578
00:44:53,976 --> 00:44:59,681
And the whore of Babylon shall ride
forth on a three-headed serpent...

579
00:44:59,856 --> 00:45:05,018
...and throughout the land
shall be a great rubbing of parts.

580
00:45:05,196 --> 00:45:09,360
And the demon shall bear
a nine-bladed sword!

581
00:45:09,534 --> 00:45:13,911
Nine-bladed! Not two
or five or seven, but nine!

582
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:18,789
Which he will wield on all wretched
sinners. Sinners just like you, sir, there.

583
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,171
- And the horns shall be on the head...
- Through Hebediah, his servant...

584
00:45:23,339 --> 00:45:28,334
...there shall in that time be rumours
of things going astray...

585
00:45:28,511 --> 00:45:33,007
...and there shall be a great confusion
as to where things really are.

586
00:45:33,182 --> 00:45:37,263
And nobody will really know
where lieth those little things...

587
00:45:37,437 --> 00:45:41,933
...with the sort of raffia-work base,
that has an attachment.

588
00:45:42,358 --> 00:45:47,483
At this time, a friend shall
lose his friend's hammer...

589
00:45:47,656 --> 00:45:50,693
...and the young shall not
know where lieth...

590
00:45:50,868 --> 00:45:52,825
...the things possessed
by their fathers...

591
00:45:52,995 --> 00:45:56,743
...that their fathers put there only
just the night before, about 8:00.

592
00:45:56,957 --> 00:45:59,875
Yea, it is written in the Book of Cyril...

593
00:46:00,044 --> 00:46:03,744
...that in that time shall the turds...

594
00:46:12,264 --> 00:46:14,173
- How much? Quickly.
- What?

595
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:17,849
- It's for the wife.
- Twenty shekels.

596
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,479
- Right.
- What?

597
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:21,355
- There you are.
- Wait a minute.

598
00:46:21,523 --> 00:46:23,765
- What?
- Well, we're supposed to haggle.

599
00:46:23,943 --> 00:46:25,769
- No, I've got to...
- What do you mean, "No"?

600
00:46:25,945 --> 00:46:27,439
- I haven't got time...
- Give it back.

601
00:46:27,613 --> 00:46:29,356
- No, no, no, I just paid you.
- Burt.

602
00:46:29,531 --> 00:46:31,607
- Yeah?
- This bloke won't haggle.

603
00:46:31,784 --> 00:46:34,454
- Won't haggle?!
- All right, do we have to?

604
00:46:34,621 --> 00:46:37,408
- Now look, I want 20 for that.
- I just gave you 20.

605
00:46:37,582 --> 00:46:39,990
- Are you telling me that's not worth 20?
- No.

606
00:46:40,168 --> 00:46:42,576
Look. Feel the quality,
that's none of your goat.

607
00:46:42,754 --> 00:46:45,589
- All right, I'll give you 19.
- No, come on, do it properly.

608
00:46:45,757 --> 00:46:48,330
- What?
- Haggle properly, this isn't worth 19.

609
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:51,261
- Well, you just said it was worth 20.
- Oh, dear, oh, dear.

610
00:46:51,429 --> 00:46:53,552
- Come on, haggle.
- All right, I'll give you 10.

611
00:46:53,723 --> 00:46:57,009
That's more like it.
Ten? Are you trying to insult me?

612
00:46:57,185 --> 00:47:00,103
Me, with a poor,
dying grandmother? Ten?

613
00:47:00,272 --> 00:47:03,023
- All right, I'll give you 11.
- Now you're getting it. 11?!

614
00:47:03,191 --> 00:47:04,899
Did I hear you right? 11?

615
00:47:05,068 --> 00:47:07,939
- This cost me 12, you want to ruin me?
- Seventeen?

616
00:47:08,113 --> 00:47:10,734
- No, no, no, no, "17"!
- Eighteen?

617
00:47:10,907 --> 00:47:13,861
- No, no, you go to 14 now.
- All right, I'll give you 14.

618
00:47:14,077 --> 00:47:17,161
- Fourteen!? Are you joking?
- That's what you told me to say!

619
00:47:17,331 --> 00:47:19,490
- Oh, dear.
- Tell me what to say, please!

620
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:22,536
- Offer me 14.
- I'll give you 14.

621
00:47:22,837 --> 00:47:25,707
- He's offering me 14 for this!
- Fifteen!

622
00:47:25,923 --> 00:47:29,126
Seventeen. My last word, I won't take
a penny less, or strike me dead.

623
00:47:29,343 --> 00:47:31,003
- Sixteen.
- Done.

624
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:33,090
Nice to do business with you.

625
00:47:33,264 --> 00:47:35,636
- I'll throw you in this as well.
- I don't want it.

626
00:47:35,808 --> 00:47:37,386
- Burt.
- Yeah.

627
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,636
- All right.
- Now, where's the 16 you owe me?

628
00:47:39,812 --> 00:47:40,975
I just gave you 20.

629
00:47:41,147 --> 00:47:43,982
- That's right, that's four I owe you.
- No, that's all right.

630
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:47,270
- No, I've got it here.
- It's all right, that's four for the gourd.

631
00:47:47,445 --> 00:47:49,936
Four? For this gourd? Four!?

632
00:47:50,114 --> 00:47:52,272
It's worth 10
if it's worth a shekel!

633
00:47:52,491 --> 00:47:55,611
- You just gave it to me for nothing.
- Yes, but it's worth 10.

634
00:47:55,995 --> 00:47:57,454
All right, all right.

635
00:48:00,207 --> 00:48:03,494
No, no, no, no, it's not worth 10,
you're supposed to argue.

636
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:06,078
"Ten for that? You must be mad!"

637
00:48:08,926 --> 00:48:12,211
Oh, well. One born every minute.

638
00:48:12,679 --> 00:48:14,339
- Daniel.
- Daniel.

639
00:48:14,514 --> 00:48:15,594
- Job.
- Job.

640
00:48:15,766 --> 00:48:17,260
- Job.
- Joshua.

641
00:48:17,434 --> 00:48:18,679
- Joshua.
- Joshua.

642
00:48:18,852 --> 00:48:19,967
- Judges.
- Judges.

643
00:48:20,145 --> 00:48:21,770
- Judges.
- And Brian.

644
00:48:21,939 --> 00:48:24,394
- And Brian.
- And Brian.

645
00:48:24,566 --> 00:48:28,398
I now propose that all seven
of these ex-brothers...

646
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:31,820
...be now entered in the minutes
as probationary martyrs to the cause.

647
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:35,655
- I second that, Reg.
- Thank you, Loretta. On the nod.

648
00:48:35,827 --> 00:48:39,872
Siblings, let us not be down on it.

649
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:44,832
One total catastrophe like this
is just the beginning!

650
00:48:45,003 --> 00:48:47,922
Their glorious deaths
shall unite us all in a...

651
00:48:48,132 --> 00:48:49,932
Look out!

652
00:49:01,187 --> 00:49:02,387
Hello?

653
00:49:03,022 --> 00:49:04,766
Matthias?

654
00:49:05,483 --> 00:49:08,567
- Reg.
- Go away.

655
00:49:09,028 --> 00:49:13,108
- Reg, it's me, Brian.
- Get off. Get off out of it.

656
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:14,481
- Stan?
- Piss off.

657
00:49:14,659 --> 00:49:17,115
- Yeah, piss off.
- Bugger off.

658
00:49:20,331 --> 00:49:21,331
Shit!

659
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,900
Coming.

660
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:32,715
Yea, verily at that time,
which is written in the Book of Obadiah...

661
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:37,222
...a man shall strike his donkey
and his nephew's donkey...

662
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:40,641
...and anyone in the vicinity
of either the nephew or the donkey.

663
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:44,138
My eyes are dim, I cannot see.

664
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,141
- Are you Matthias?
- Yes.

665
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:49,021
We believe you may
be hiding one Brian of Nazareth...

666
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:52,528
...member of the terrorist organization
the People's Front of Judea.

667
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:57,407
Me? No, I'm just a poor old man,
I have no time for lawbreakers.

668
00:49:57,578 --> 00:50:01,825
My legs are grey, my ears are nulled,
my eyes are old and bent...

669
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,197
Quiet!

670
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:07,539
Silly person. Guards, search the house.

671
00:50:16,973 --> 00:50:21,434
You know the penalty laid down by Roman
law for harbouring a known criminal?

672
00:50:21,603 --> 00:50:24,853
- No.
- Crucifixion.

673
00:50:26,274 --> 00:50:29,809
- Nasty, eh?
- It could be worse.

674
00:50:29,986 --> 00:50:34,280
- What do you mean, "could be worse"?
- Well, you could be stabbed.

675
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:36,358
Stabbed? It takes a second.

676
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:40,912
Crucifixion lasts hours.
It's a slow, horrible death.

677
00:50:41,081 --> 00:50:44,913
Well, at least it gets you
out in the open air.

678
00:50:45,085 --> 00:50:47,685
You're weird.

679
00:50:54,761 --> 00:50:57,881
No, sir, couldn't find anything, sir.

680
00:50:58,056 --> 00:51:02,221
Well, don't worry, you've not seen
the last of us, weirdo.

681
00:51:02,395 --> 00:51:04,886
- Big nose.
- Watch it!

682
00:51:08,067 --> 00:51:10,392
That was lucky.

683
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:17,106
- I'm sorry, Reg.
- Oh, it's all right. Siblings, he's sorry.

684
00:51:17,285 --> 00:51:19,989
He's sorry he led the Fifth legion
to our headquarters.

685
00:51:20,162 --> 00:51:21,822
Well, that's all right then, Brian.

686
00:51:21,998 --> 00:51:25,117
Sit down! Have a scone.
Make yourself at home.

687
00:51:25,293 --> 00:51:26,835
You klutz!

688
00:51:27,003 --> 00:51:32,245
You stupid, birdbrained, flat-headed...

689
00:51:35,136 --> 00:51:37,543
- with a great juicy melon behind.

690
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:42,591
My legs are old and bent,
my ears are grizzled, yes?

691
00:51:42,768 --> 00:51:45,888
There's one place we didn't look. Guards!

692
00:51:46,063 --> 00:51:52,268
I'm just a poor old man, my sight is dim,
my eyes are poor, my nose is knackered.

693
00:51:52,446 --> 00:51:57,523
- Have you ever seen anyone crucified?
- Crucifixion's a doddle.

694
00:51:57,701 --> 00:52:00,618
Don't keep saying that.

695
00:52:04,124 --> 00:52:06,366
Found this spoon, sir.

696
00:52:06,543 --> 00:52:09,248
Well done, sergeant.

697
00:52:09,421 --> 00:52:13,419
We'll be back, oddball.

698
00:52:16,219 --> 00:52:19,505
- Open up.
- You haven't given us time to hide.

699
00:52:44,165 --> 00:52:48,910
Don't pass judgment on other people,
or you might get judged yourself.

700
00:52:49,087 --> 00:52:50,087
What?

701
00:52:50,338 --> 00:52:52,710
I said, don't pass judgment
on other people...

702
00:52:52,882 --> 00:52:55,551
...or else you might get judged too.

703
00:52:55,718 --> 00:52:57,047
- Who, me?
- Yes.

704
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:00,838
- Thank you very much.
- Well, not just you, all of you.

705
00:53:01,015 --> 00:53:03,222
- That's a nice gourd.
- What?

706
00:53:03,393 --> 00:53:05,599
- How much do you want for the gourd?
- You can have it.

707
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:08,475
- Have it?
- Yes. Consider the lilies.

708
00:53:08,648 --> 00:53:10,854
- Don't you want to haggle?
- No. In the field.

709
00:53:11,025 --> 00:53:13,148
- What's wrong with it, then?
- Nothing, take it.

710
00:53:13,361 --> 00:53:16,316
- Consider the lilies?
- Well, the birds, then.

711
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:18,032
- What birds?
- Any birds.

712
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:21,284
- Why?
- Well, have they got jobs?

713
00:53:21,453 --> 00:53:23,031
- Who?
- The birds.

714
00:53:23,205 --> 00:53:24,997
Have the birds got jobs?!

715
00:53:25,207 --> 00:53:28,161
- What's the matter with him?
- He says the birds are scrounging.

716
00:53:28,335 --> 00:53:31,621
No, the point is the birds,
they do all right, don't they?

717
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:34,508
- Well, and good luck to them!
- Yeah, they're very pretty.

718
00:53:34,717 --> 00:53:38,845
Okay. And you're much more
important than they are, right?

719
00:53:39,013 --> 00:53:41,385
So, what are you worrying about?
There you are! See?

720
00:53:41,765 --> 00:53:44,091
I'm worrying about what
you've got against birds.

721
00:53:44,685 --> 00:53:47,176
I haven't got anything against birds.
Consider lilies...

722
00:53:47,354 --> 00:53:50,391
- He's having a go at the flowers now.
- Give the flowers a chance.

723
00:53:50,566 --> 00:53:52,642
- I'll give you one for it.
- It's yours!

724
00:53:52,818 --> 00:53:54,099
Two then.

725
00:53:54,278 --> 00:53:56,899
Look, there was this man,
and he had two servants...

726
00:53:57,114 --> 00:53:58,193
- What were they called?
- What?

727
00:53:58,365 --> 00:54:00,524
- What were their names?
- I don't know.

728
00:54:00,701 --> 00:54:02,113
And he gave them some talents...

729
00:54:02,287 --> 00:54:04,694
- You don't know?
- Well, it doesn't matter.

730
00:54:04,873 --> 00:54:06,782
He doesn't know what they were called!

731
00:54:06,958 --> 00:54:09,081
Oh, they were called
Simon and Adrian. Now...

732
00:54:09,252 --> 00:54:10,628
You said you didn't know!

733
00:54:10,795 --> 00:54:13,465
It doesn't matter,
the point is there were two servants...

734
00:54:13,632 --> 00:54:16,502
- He's making it up as he goes along!
- No, I'm not!

735
00:54:16,676 --> 00:54:19,048
And he gave them...
Wait a minute, were there three?

736
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:21,509
- He's terrible.
- There were three...

737
00:54:21,723 --> 00:54:25,009
- He's still a traitor!
- Oh, get off!

738
00:54:30,982 --> 00:54:33,853
Now hear this. Blessed are they...

739
00:54:34,027 --> 00:54:38,605
...who convert their neighbour's ox,
for they shall inhibit their girth.

740
00:54:38,782 --> 00:54:44,024
- Rubbish!
- And to them only shall be given...

741
00:54:44,204 --> 00:54:46,447
To them only...

742
00:54:47,291 --> 00:54:50,328
...shall be given...

743
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:53,255
What?

744
00:54:54,006 --> 00:54:56,841
- Shall be given what?
- Oh, nothing.

745
00:54:57,051 --> 00:54:58,711
- What were you going to say?
- Nothing.

746
00:54:58,886 --> 00:55:01,093
- You were going to say something.
- I finished.

747
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:03,505
- Oh, no, no.
- Come on, tell us before you go.

748
00:55:03,724 --> 00:55:05,764
- I wasn't going to say anything.
- No, you hadn't.

749
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:07,809
- What won't he tell us?
- He won't say.

750
00:55:07,979 --> 00:55:09,389
- Is it a secret?
- No.

751
00:55:09,563 --> 00:55:11,556
- Is it?
- It must be, otherwise he'd tell us.

752
00:55:11,732 --> 00:55:13,274
- Tell us.
- Leave me alone.

753
00:55:13,442 --> 00:55:15,933
- What is the secret?
- Is it the secret of eternal life?

754
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:17,154
He won't say!

755
00:55:17,321 --> 00:55:19,812
If I knew the secret
of eternal life, I wouldn't say.

756
00:55:19,991 --> 00:55:21,817
- Leave me alone.
- Just tell me, please.

757
00:55:21,993 --> 00:55:24,484
- No, tell us, master, we were here first.
- Rubbish!

758
00:55:24,662 --> 00:55:26,370
- Five!
- Go away!

759
00:55:26,539 --> 00:55:28,413
- Tell us, master.
- I can't go above 5.

760
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:31,538
- Is that his gourd?
- Yes, but it's under offer.

761
00:55:31,712 --> 00:55:34,962
- This is his gourd.
- Ten!

762
00:55:35,132 --> 00:55:40,292
It is his gourd.
We will carry it for you, master.

763
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:41,870
Master?

764
00:55:42,264 --> 00:55:45,680
He's gone. He's been taken up.

765
00:55:45,851 --> 00:55:49,302
- Oh, he has been taken up!
- Eighteen!

766
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:51,139
No, there he is. Over there.

767
00:56:17,258 --> 00:56:18,258
Look!

768
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:23,669
- He has given us a sign.
- He has given us his shoe.

769
00:56:23,848 --> 00:56:26,600
The shoe is the sign!
Let us follow his example!

770
00:56:26,768 --> 00:56:29,389
- What?
- Let us, like him...

771
00:56:29,562 --> 00:56:32,136
...hold up one shoe and let the other
be upon our foot...

772
00:56:32,315 --> 00:56:35,731
...for this is his sign that all who
follow him shall do likewise!

773
00:56:35,902 --> 00:56:40,979
No, no, the shoe is a sign that we must
gather shoes together in abundance.

774
00:56:41,157 --> 00:56:45,985
- Cast off the shoes. Follow the gourd!
- No, let us gather shoes together.

775
00:56:46,162 --> 00:56:47,740
- Let me!
- Oh, get off!

776
00:56:47,914 --> 00:56:50,037
No, it is a sign that, like him,
we must think...

777
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:53,043
...not of the things of the body,
but of the face and head!

778
00:56:53,211 --> 00:56:56,081
- Give me your shoe!
- Get off!

779
00:56:56,256 --> 00:56:59,422
Follow the gourd,
the holy gourd of Jerusalem!

780
00:56:59,592 --> 00:57:02,511
- The gourd!
- Hold up the sandal, like he has...

781
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,431
- It is a shoe! It is a shoe!
- It's a sandal!

782
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:08,600
- No, it isn't! It is a shoe!
- Cast it away!

783
00:57:08,769 --> 00:57:10,228
- Put it on!
- Now clear off.

784
00:57:10,396 --> 00:57:12,472
Take the shoes and follow him!

785
00:57:12,648 --> 00:57:17,987
Come all ye who call
yourselves Gourdenes.

786
00:57:18,946 --> 00:57:20,689
Stop, I say.

787
00:57:20,864 --> 00:57:23,864
Stop. Let us...

788
00:57:24,493 --> 00:57:26,533
Let us pray.

789
00:57:26,704 --> 00:57:33,157
Yea, he cometh to us
like the seed to the grave...

790
00:57:54,941 --> 00:57:56,341
Master!

791
00:58:19,799 --> 00:58:23,844
Hey, is there another way down?

792
00:58:24,012 --> 00:58:27,844
Is there another path down to the river?

793
00:58:28,016 --> 00:58:30,055
Please, please, help me! I've got to get...

794
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:35,790
My foot!

795
00:58:37,026 --> 00:58:40,609
- Damn! Damn! Damn!
- I'm sorry.

796
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:44,362
- Damn! Damn and blast it!
- I'm sorry!

797
00:58:44,533 --> 00:58:48,827
Don't you shush me. Eighteen years
of total silence, and you shush me.

798
00:58:48,996 --> 00:58:52,282
- What?
- I've kept my vow for 18 years.

799
00:58:52,458 --> 00:58:56,538
Not a single recognizable,
articulate sound has passed my lips.

800
00:58:56,712 --> 00:58:58,752
Please be quiet
for another five minutes.

801
00:58:58,923 --> 00:59:01,675
It doesn't matter now,
I might as well enjoy myself.

802
00:59:01,842 --> 00:59:05,377
The times in the last 18 years
I wanted to shout and sing...

803
00:59:05,554 --> 00:59:08,970
...and scream my name out!
Oh, I'm alive!

804
00:59:16,149 --> 00:59:20,977
I'm alive! I'm alive!
Hello, birds! Hello, trees! I'm alive...

805
00:59:21,196 --> 00:59:22,821
Get off! I'm alive!

806
00:59:27,536 --> 00:59:30,536
Master! Master!

807
00:59:31,707 --> 00:59:34,743
The master! He is here!

808
00:59:34,918 --> 00:59:37,326
- The shoe!
- It was the gourd!

809
00:59:37,504 --> 00:59:39,295
The shoe has brought us!

810
00:59:39,464 --> 00:59:42,668
Speak! Speak to us, master!
Speak to us!

811
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:47,339
- Go away!
- A blessing! A blessing!

812
00:59:47,514 --> 00:59:52,141
- How shall we go away, master?
- Just go away and leave me alone.

813
00:59:52,603 --> 00:59:54,180
Give us a sign.

814
00:59:54,354 --> 00:59:57,770
He has given us a sign,
he has brought us to this place!

815
00:59:57,983 --> 01:00:00,653
I didn't bring you here!
You just followed me!

816
01:00:00,862 --> 01:00:03,567
It's still a good sign,
by any standard.

817
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:06,824
Master, your people have walked
many miles to be with you.

818
01:00:06,993 --> 01:00:08,820
They are weary and have not eaten.

819
01:00:09,037 --> 01:00:13,615
- It's not my fault they haven't eaten!
- There is no food in this high mountain.

820
01:00:13,833 --> 01:00:16,917
What about the juniper bushes
over there?

821
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:20,873
A miracle! A miracle!

822
01:00:21,049 --> 01:00:24,583
He has made the bush
fruitful by his word!

823
01:00:24,761 --> 01:00:26,552
They brought forth juniper berries!

824
01:00:26,721 --> 01:00:29,971
Of course they brought forth
juniper berries, they're juniper bushes.

825
01:00:30,141 --> 01:00:31,304
What do you expect?!

826
01:00:31,517 --> 01:00:33,177
Show us another miracle.

827
01:00:33,353 --> 01:00:35,429
Do not tempt him, shallow ones!

828
01:00:35,605 --> 01:00:38,392
Is not the miracle
of the juniper bushes enough?

829
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:43,350
- I say, those are my juniper bushes.
- They are a gift from God!

830
01:00:43,571 --> 01:00:45,980
They're all I've bloody got to eat.

831
01:00:46,158 --> 01:00:50,571
I say, get off of those bushes!
Go on! Clear off, the lot of you.

832
01:00:50,788 --> 01:00:56,209
- Lord, I am affected by a bald patch.
- I'm healed!

833
01:00:56,377 --> 01:00:59,331
- The master has healed me!
- I didn't touch him!

834
01:00:59,505 --> 01:01:01,996
I was blind, and now I can see!

835
01:01:02,174 --> 01:01:06,468
A miracle! A miracle! A miracle!

836
01:01:08,347 --> 01:01:13,175
Tell them to stop it. I hadn't said a word
for 18 years till he came along.

837
01:01:13,394 --> 01:01:17,012
A miracle! He is the Messiah!

838
01:01:17,231 --> 01:01:22,225
- And he hurt my foot!
- Hurt my foot, Lord! Hurt mine! Hurt mine!

839
01:01:22,403 --> 01:01:26,021
- Hail Messiah!
- I'm not the Messiah!

840
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:29,490
I say you are, Lord.
And I should know, I've followed a few!

841
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:33,077
- Hail Messiah!
- I'm not the Messiah!

842
01:01:33,248 --> 01:01:36,451
Would you please listen, I am not
the Messiah, do you understand?

843
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:38,286
Honestly!

844
01:01:38,962 --> 01:01:42,746
Only the true Messiah denies his divinity.

845
01:01:42,966 --> 01:01:46,086
What? Well, what sort of chance
does that give me?

846
01:01:46,261 --> 01:01:52,264
- All right, I am the Messiah!
- He is! He is the Messiah!

847
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:54,682
Now, fuck off!

848
01:02:02,444 --> 01:02:06,393
- How shall we fuck off, Lord?
- Just go away! Leave me alone!

849
01:02:06,615 --> 01:02:09,284
You told these people
to eat my juniper berries.

850
01:02:09,451 --> 01:02:12,368
You break my bloody foot,
you break my vow of silence...

851
01:02:12,537 --> 01:02:15,112
...and then you try and clean up
on my juniper bushes!

852
01:02:15,291 --> 01:02:19,289
Lay off! This is the Messiah,
the chosen one!

853
01:02:19,462 --> 01:02:22,416
- No, he's not.
- An unbeliever!

854
01:02:22,632 --> 01:02:23,830
An unbeliever!

855
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:29,127
- Persecute! Kill the heretic!
- Yeah! Kill! Kill! Kill!

856
01:02:29,764 --> 01:02:32,681
- Kill!
- Leave him alone!

857
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:35,009
Leave him alone!

858
01:02:36,228 --> 01:02:37,343
Leave him alone.

859
01:02:37,563 --> 01:02:40,398
Put him down. Please!

860
01:02:44,236 --> 01:02:45,436
Brian?

861
01:02:45,988 --> 01:02:47,388
Judith?

862
01:03:34,204 --> 01:03:38,783
Look, there he is!
The chosen one has woken!

863
01:03:41,044 --> 01:03:42,244
Brian!

864
01:03:44,089 --> 01:03:45,489
Mother!

865
01:03:46,009 --> 01:03:49,378
- Brian!
- Hang on, Mother!

866
01:03:52,265 --> 01:03:55,349
- Hello, Mother.
- Don't you "hello, Mother" me.

867
01:03:55,518 --> 01:03:58,092
- What are those people doing out there?
- Well, I...

868
01:03:58,271 --> 01:04:00,310
Come on! What have you
been up to, my lad?

869
01:04:00,481 --> 01:04:02,770
I think they must have
popped by for something.

870
01:04:02,942 --> 01:04:08,019
Popped by?! Swelled by, more like.
There's a multitude out there!

871
01:04:08,197 --> 01:04:09,905
They started following me yesterday.

872
01:04:10,074 --> 01:04:13,739
Well, they can stop following
you right now.

873
01:04:14,579 --> 01:04:19,157
Now stop following my son.
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

874
01:04:19,334 --> 01:04:23,996
The Messiah! The Messiah!
Show us the Messiah!

875
01:04:24,172 --> 01:04:27,007
- The who?
- The Messiah!

876
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:31,420
There's no Messiah in here.
There's a mess all right, but no Messiah.

877
01:04:31,597 --> 01:04:33,056
Now go away!

878
01:04:33,265 --> 01:04:35,341
Brian! Brian!

879
01:04:35,517 --> 01:04:37,843
Right, my lad,
what have you been up to?

880
01:04:38,062 --> 01:04:39,888
- Nothing, Mum.
- Come on, out with it.

881
01:04:40,064 --> 01:04:41,890
They think I'm the Messiah, Mum.

882
01:04:42,316 --> 01:04:44,522
- What have you been telling them?
- Nothing, l...

883
01:04:44,693 --> 01:04:47,647
- You're only making it worse for yourself.
- Look, I can explain...

884
01:04:47,821 --> 01:04:52,982
No, let me explain, Mrs. Cohen!
Your son is a born leader!

885
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:56,576
Those people out there are following him
because they believe in him.

886
01:04:56,747 --> 01:04:58,455
They believe he can
give them hope.

887
01:04:58,624 --> 01:05:03,582
Hope of a new life,
a new world, a better future!

888
01:05:04,546 --> 01:05:07,998
- Who's that!?
- That's Judith, Mum.

889
01:05:08,175 --> 01:05:11,175
Judith, Mother.

890
01:05:14,474 --> 01:05:16,882
Show us the Messiah!

891
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:23,850
Now you listen here,
he's not the Messiah!

892
01:05:24,025 --> 01:05:27,441
He's a very naughty boy! Now go away!

893
01:05:27,654 --> 01:05:31,568
- Who are you?
- I'm his mother, that's who.

894
01:05:31,783 --> 01:05:35,995
Behold his mother! Behold his mother!

895
01:05:36,162 --> 01:05:39,448
Hail to thee, mother of Brian!

896
01:05:39,624 --> 01:05:43,325
Blessed art thou! Hosanna!

897
01:05:43,503 --> 01:05:47,880
All things to thee, now and always!

898
01:05:48,091 --> 01:05:50,962
Now, don't think you can
get around me like that.

899
01:05:51,136 --> 01:05:54,754
He's not coming out,
and that's my final word.

900
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:57,300
Now shove off!

901
01:05:57,517 --> 01:05:58,517
No!

902
01:05:59,854 --> 01:06:03,437
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes!

903
01:06:03,899 --> 01:06:07,565
- Oh, I see. It's like that, is it?
- Yes!

904
01:06:08,821 --> 01:06:13,448
All right then, you can see him
for one minute, but not one second more!

905
01:06:13,618 --> 01:06:16,239
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

906
01:06:16,454 --> 01:06:20,498
- Promise?
- Well, all right.

907
01:06:21,083 --> 01:06:24,287
All right, here he is then.
Come on, Brian, come and talk to them.

908
01:06:24,462 --> 01:06:27,166
- But, Mum, Judith...
- Leave that Welsh tart alone.

909
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:29,747
I don't really want to, Mum.

910
01:06:36,766 --> 01:06:40,182
- Good morning!
- A blessing! A blessing!

911
01:06:40,811 --> 01:06:45,309
No, please. Please, please, listen!

912
01:06:45,484 --> 01:06:48,189
I've got one or two things to say.

913
01:06:48,403 --> 01:06:50,811
Tell us! Tell us both of them!

914
01:06:51,323 --> 01:06:55,949
Look, you've got it all wrong!
You don't need to follow me.

915
01:06:56,119 --> 01:06:59,654
You don't need to follow anybody!

916
01:06:59,998 --> 01:07:04,707
You've got to think for yourselves.
You're all individuals!

917
01:07:04,878 --> 01:07:08,164
Yes, we're all individuals!

918
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:10,333
You're all different.

919
01:07:10,550 --> 01:07:13,421
Yes, we are all different!

920
01:07:13,595 --> 01:07:15,195
I'm not.

921
01:07:16,556 --> 01:07:20,091
You've all got to work it out
for yourselves!

922
01:07:20,310 --> 01:07:24,390
Yes, we've got to work it
out for ourselves!

923
01:07:24,648 --> 01:07:26,248
Exactly!

924
01:07:26,817 --> 01:07:29,984
- Tell us more!
- No, that's the point!

925
01:07:30,154 --> 01:07:33,239
Don't let anyone tell you what to do!

926
01:07:33,408 --> 01:07:36,741
- Otherwise... Oh, no!
- That's enough! That's enough.

927
01:07:38,663 --> 01:07:42,162
That wasn't a minute.

928
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:46,912
- Oh, yes, it was.
- Oh, no, it wasn't!

929
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:49,917
Now stop that, and go away.

930
01:07:50,133 --> 01:07:52,172
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

931
01:07:52,385 --> 01:07:53,713
Are you a virgin?

932
01:07:54,429 --> 01:07:56,587
I beg your pardon?

933
01:07:56,973 --> 01:08:01,101
Well, if it's not a personal question,
are you a virgin?

934
01:08:01,311 --> 01:08:06,138
If it's not a personal question?!
How much more personal can you get?

935
01:08:06,316 --> 01:08:08,771
Now piss off.

936
01:08:10,153 --> 01:08:12,525
- She is.
- Must be. Definitely.

937
01:08:12,697 --> 01:08:15,236
Definitely. Definitely.

938
01:08:18,245 --> 01:08:19,526
Morning, Saviour!

939
01:08:29,048 --> 01:08:31,171
Lay your hands on me! Quick!

940
01:08:31,342 --> 01:08:34,960
Now, don't jostle the chosen one!
Please!

941
01:08:35,137 --> 01:08:39,384
Don't push that baby in the
Saviour's face! He'll touch it later!

942
01:08:39,558 --> 01:08:40,756
I say...

943
01:08:40,935 --> 01:08:43,176
Could he see my wife?
She has a headache.

944
01:08:43,354 --> 01:08:44,812
You'll have to wait, I'm afraid!

945
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:47,305
She's very bad,
and we've got a luncheon!

946
01:08:47,483 --> 01:08:49,060
Look, the lepers are queuing!

947
01:08:49,234 --> 01:08:51,856
Her brother-in-law
is the ex-mayor of Gath.

948
01:08:52,029 --> 01:08:55,979
Can I introduce you to the man who's
letting us have the mounts on Sunday?

949
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:58,828
- Hello.
- Don't push!

950
01:08:58,995 --> 01:09:02,115
Now keep the noise down, please!

951
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:06,952
Those possessed by devils, try and keep
them under control a bit! Can't you?

952
01:09:07,128 --> 01:09:10,628
Incurables, you'll just have
to wait for a few minutes.

953
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:14,927
Women taken in sin, line up
against that wall, will you?

954
01:09:15,095 --> 01:09:16,295
Brian?

955
01:09:17,138 --> 01:09:19,712
Brian! You were fantastic!

956
01:09:19,891 --> 01:09:23,094
- You weren't so bad yourself.
- No, what you said just now!

957
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:26,021
- Quite extraordinary!
- What? Oh, that. Was it?

958
01:09:26,189 --> 01:09:30,353
We don't need leaders! You're so right!
Reg has been dominating us for too long.

959
01:09:30,527 --> 01:09:34,062
- Well, yes...
- It needed saying, and you said it, Brian!

960
01:09:34,239 --> 01:09:35,698
You're very attractive.

961
01:09:35,865 --> 01:09:38,902
It's our revolution!
We can all do it together!

962
01:09:39,077 --> 01:09:40,120
I think...

963
01:09:40,287 --> 01:09:43,787
We're all behind you, Brian!
The revolution is in your hands!

964
01:09:43,958 --> 01:09:47,327
What?
No, that's not what I meant at all!

965
01:09:47,503 --> 01:09:50,753
You're fucking nicked, me old beauty!

966
01:09:50,923 --> 01:09:52,123
Right!

967
01:09:58,806 --> 01:09:59,921
Stop it!

968
01:10:02,768 --> 01:10:05,603
Well, Brian, you've given us
a good run for our money.

969
01:10:05,771 --> 01:10:07,171
A what?

970
01:10:07,857 --> 01:10:12,435
And this time,
I guarantee you will not escape.

971
01:10:12,612 --> 01:10:17,320
Guard!
Do we have any crucifixions today?

972
01:10:17,491 --> 01:10:20,991
139, sir. Special celebration.
Passover, sir.

973
01:10:21,162 --> 01:10:26,998
Right! Now we have 140!
Nice round number, eh, Biggus?

974
01:10:28,378 --> 01:10:30,287
- Hail Caesar!
- Hail!

975
01:10:30,464 --> 01:10:34,378
The crowd are getting restless, sir.
Permission to disperse them, please.

976
01:10:35,177 --> 01:10:37,964
Disperse them?
But I haven't addressed them yet!

977
01:10:38,138 --> 01:10:39,632
No, I know, sir, but...

978
01:10:39,806 --> 01:10:41,680
My address is a high point
of Passover!

979
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:45,136
My friend Biggus Dickus has come
all the way from Rome to hear it!

980
01:10:45,312 --> 01:10:47,933
- Hail Caesar!
- Hail Caesar!

981
01:10:48,690 --> 01:10:50,979
You're not...

982
01:10:51,151 --> 01:10:54,602
You're not thinking of giving
it a miss this year, then, sir?

983
01:10:55,322 --> 01:10:56,733
Give it a miss?!

984
01:10:56,907 --> 01:11:00,192
Well, it's just that they're
in a rather funny mood today, sir.

985
01:11:00,369 --> 01:11:01,483
Really, centurion!

986
01:11:01,662 --> 01:11:05,790
I'm surprised to hear a man like you
rattled by a rabble of rowdy rebels.

987
01:11:06,124 --> 01:11:08,794
- A bit thundery, sir.
- Take him away!

988
01:11:08,961 --> 01:11:11,796
I'm a Roman! I can prove it, honestly!

989
01:11:11,964 --> 01:11:15,049
And crucify him well!

990
01:11:15,468 --> 01:11:16,868
Biggus!

991
01:11:18,054 --> 01:11:20,510
- I really wouldn't, sir!
- Out of the way, centurion!

992
01:11:20,682 --> 01:11:25,557
Let me come with you, Pontius. I may be
of assistance if there is a sudden crisis!

993
01:11:27,438 --> 01:11:31,436
Right! Now, item four: Attainment of world
supremacy within the next five years.

994
01:11:31,609 --> 01:11:34,694
- Francis, you've done some work on this?
- Yeah, thank you, Reg.

995
01:11:34,862 --> 01:11:38,113
Well, quite frankly, siblings,
I think five years is optimistic...

996
01:11:38,283 --> 01:11:41,319
...unless we can smash the Roman
Empire within the next 12 months!

997
01:11:41,494 --> 01:11:43,154
- Twelve months?
- Yeah, 12 months.

998
01:11:43,329 --> 01:11:47,078
And let's face it, as empires go,
this is the big one.

999
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:51,117
So we gotta get up off our arses
and stop just talking about it!

1000
01:11:51,296 --> 01:11:52,338
Hear! Hear!

1001
01:11:52,505 --> 01:11:56,123
I agree! It's action that counts,
not words, and we need action now!

1002
01:11:56,718 --> 01:12:00,503
You're right. We could sit around here
all day, talking, passing resolutions...

1003
01:12:00,681 --> 01:12:04,548
...making clever speeches,
it's not gonna shift one Roman soldier!

1004
01:12:04,727 --> 01:12:08,096
So let's just stop gabbing on about it!
It's completely pointless...

1005
01:12:08,272 --> 01:12:10,264
...and it's getting us nowhere!
- Right!

1006
01:12:10,441 --> 01:12:12,896
I agree!
This is a complete waste of time!

1007
01:12:14,236 --> 01:12:15,434
They've arrested Brian!

1008
01:12:15,613 --> 01:12:17,652
- What?
- They've dragged him off!

1009
01:12:17,823 --> 01:12:19,365
They're gonna crucify him!

1010
01:12:19,533 --> 01:12:23,032
Right!
This calls for immediate discussion!

1011
01:12:23,203 --> 01:12:24,246
- What?!
- Immediate!

1012
01:12:24,413 --> 01:12:25,456
- Right!
- New motion?

1013
01:12:25,623 --> 01:12:31,079
Completely new motion!
That there be immediate action...

1014
01:12:31,253 --> 01:12:32,664
Once the vote has been taken.

1015
01:12:32,838 --> 01:12:35,673
Obviously once the vote's been taken.
Can't act on a resolution...

1016
01:12:35,841 --> 01:12:38,130
- Reg, let's go now, please!
- Right! Right!

1017
01:12:38,302 --> 01:12:42,596
In the light of fresh information
from sibling Judith...

1018
01:12:42,766 --> 01:12:44,758
- Not so fast, Reg.
- Reg, for God's sake!

1019
01:12:44,934 --> 01:12:46,974
It's perfectly simple!

1020
01:12:47,145 --> 01:12:50,063
All you've gotta do is to go out
of that door now...

1021
01:12:50,273 --> 01:12:52,847
...and try to stop the Romans
nailing him up!

1022
01:12:53,026 --> 01:12:54,485
It's happening, Reg!

1023
01:12:54,653 --> 01:12:59,647
Something's actually happening, Reg!
Can't you understand?

1024
01:13:05,121 --> 01:13:08,740
- Yeah, hello.
- Another little ego trip from the feminists.

1025
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:11,490
- What?
- Sorry, Loretta.

1026
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:13,579
Read that back, would you?

1027
01:13:26,768 --> 01:13:27,768
Next.

1028
01:13:28,396 --> 01:13:29,806
- Crucifixion?
- Yes.

1029
01:13:29,981 --> 01:13:34,726
Good. Out of the door,
line on the left, one cross each.

1030
01:13:34,902 --> 01:13:35,902
Next.

1031
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:37,565
Crucifixion?

1032
01:13:37,738 --> 01:13:43,278
Good. Out of the door, line on the left,
one cross each. Next.

1033
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:46,453
- Crucifixion?
- No, freedom.

1034
01:13:46,622 --> 01:13:47,867
- What?
- Freedom for me.

1035
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:52,370
They said I hadn't done anything
so I could go free and live on an island.

1036
01:13:53,587 --> 01:13:55,580
That's jolly good.
Well, off you go, then.

1037
01:13:55,756 --> 01:13:58,710
No, I'm only pulling your leg.
It's crucifixion, really.

1038
01:13:58,884 --> 01:14:00,711
I see. Very good, very good.

1039
01:14:00,886 --> 01:14:02,049
Well, out of the door.

1040
01:14:02,221 --> 01:14:04,629
Out of the door,
one cross each, line on the left.

1041
01:14:04,807 --> 01:14:07,927
Line on the left. Yes, thank you.
Crucifixion?

1042
01:14:08,102 --> 01:14:09,347
- Yes.
- Good.

1043
01:14:23,410 --> 01:14:26,446
People of Jerusalem!

1044
01:14:28,165 --> 01:14:31,119
Rome is your friend!

1045
01:14:36,173 --> 01:14:40,005
To prove our friendship,
it is customary at this time...

1046
01:14:40,177 --> 01:14:44,755
...to release a wrongdoer
from our prisons.

1047
01:14:48,685 --> 01:14:52,683
Whom would you have me release?

1048
01:14:52,856 --> 01:14:55,656
Release Roger!

1049
01:14:56,026 --> 01:14:59,811
Release Roger! Release Roger!

1050
01:15:02,659 --> 01:15:07,321
Very well, I shall release Roger!

1051
01:15:10,375 --> 01:15:12,581
Sir, we don't have a Roger, sir.

1052
01:15:12,752 --> 01:15:16,666
- What?
- We don't have anyone of that name, sir.

1053
01:15:16,839 --> 01:15:19,627
We have no Roger!

1054
01:15:22,595 --> 01:15:25,051
But what about Roderick, then?

1055
01:15:25,223 --> 01:15:28,888
Release Roderick! Release Roderick!

1056
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:33,805
Centurion, why do they titter so?

1057
01:15:35,024 --> 01:15:37,729
Just some Jewish joke, sir.

1058
01:15:39,153 --> 01:15:42,274
Are they ragging me?

1059
01:15:43,867 --> 01:15:46,156
Oh, no, sir!

1060
01:15:47,496 --> 01:15:51,825
Very well. I shall release Roderick!

1061
01:15:52,001 --> 01:15:53,910
Sir, we don't have a Roderick either.

1062
01:15:54,086 --> 01:15:57,206
- No Roger, no Roderick?
- Sorry, sir.

1063
01:15:57,381 --> 01:16:02,173
Who is this...?
Who is this Roderick to whom you refer?

1064
01:16:02,344 --> 01:16:03,922
He is a robber!

1065
01:16:05,306 --> 01:16:07,906
And a rapist!

1066
01:16:08,475 --> 01:16:11,875
And a pickpocket!

1067
01:16:13,605 --> 01:16:15,432
He sounds a notorious criminal.

1068
01:16:15,608 --> 01:16:17,351
We haven't got him, sir.

1069
01:16:18,402 --> 01:16:20,193
Do we have anyone in our prisons?

1070
01:16:20,362 --> 01:16:22,189
- We've got a Samson, sir.
- Samson?

1071
01:16:22,364 --> 01:16:27,360
Samson the Sadducee Strangler, sir.
Silas the Syrian Assassin.

1072
01:16:27,537 --> 01:16:31,405
Several seditious scribes
from Caesarea.

1073
01:16:31,583 --> 01:16:32,626
Sixty-seven...

1074
01:16:32,792 --> 01:16:35,165
- Let me speak to them, Pontius!
- Oh, no!

1075
01:16:35,337 --> 01:16:36,831
Good idea, Biggus!

1076
01:16:37,005 --> 01:16:43,719
Citizens! We have Samson the Sadducee
Strangler, Silas the Assyrian Assassin...

1077
01:16:43,887 --> 01:16:47,885
...several seditious scribes
from Caesarea...

1078
01:16:48,058 --> 01:16:49,058
Next.

1079
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:52,386
- Crucifixion?
- Yes.

1080
01:16:52,562 --> 01:16:56,774
Good. Out of the door,
line on the left, one cross each. Jailor?

1081
01:16:56,942 --> 01:17:00,607
- Excuse me? There's been a mistake...
- Just a moment, would you? Jailor?

1082
01:17:00,779 --> 01:17:04,728
- How many have come through?
- What?

1083
01:17:04,908 --> 01:17:07,743
How many have come through?

1084
01:17:07,911 --> 01:17:08,911
What?

1085
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:12,158
You'll have to speak...

1086
01:17:15,044 --> 01:17:18,709
Speak up, sir.
He's... He's d...

1087
01:17:18,881 --> 01:17:22,926
He's deaf... Deaf as a post, sir.

1088
01:17:23,094 --> 01:17:26,878
How many have come through?

1089
01:17:30,142 --> 01:17:32,812
- Oh, dear.
- I make it 90...

1090
01:17:32,979 --> 01:17:34,603
Ninety...

1091
01:17:34,772 --> 01:17:36,314
Ninety...

1092
01:17:37,483 --> 01:17:39,392
Ninety-six, sir.

1093
01:17:39,568 --> 01:17:42,059
It's such a senseless waste
of human life, isn't it?

1094
01:17:42,238 --> 01:17:43,838
No, sir!

1095
01:17:44,573 --> 01:17:48,654
Not with these b...
Bastards, sir!

1096
01:17:54,625 --> 01:17:56,868
Crucifixion's too good for them, sir.

1097
01:17:57,045 --> 01:17:59,583
I don't think you could
say it's good, it's nasty!

1098
01:17:59,756 --> 01:18:01,879
It's not as n...

1099
01:18:04,803 --> 01:18:08,172
Not as nasty as something
I just thought up, sir.

1100
01:18:08,348 --> 01:18:11,468
- Now, crucifixion?
- Is there someone I could speak to?

1101
01:18:11,643 --> 01:18:15,012
- Well...
- I know where to get it if you want it.

1102
01:18:15,188 --> 01:18:19,352
- What?
- Don't worry about him, sir. He's de...

1103
01:18:21,945 --> 01:18:24,436
He's deaf and mad, sir.

1104
01:18:24,615 --> 01:18:26,274
Well, how did he get the job?

1105
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:28,822
Bloody Pilate's pet, sir!

1106
01:18:28,994 --> 01:18:33,122
Get a move on, big nose! There's people
waiting to be crucified out here!

1107
01:18:33,624 --> 01:18:35,450
Could I see a lawyer or someone?

1108
01:18:35,626 --> 01:18:37,702
- Do you have a lawyer?
- No, but I'm a Roman.

1109
01:18:37,878 --> 01:18:40,285
How about a retrial?
We've got plenty of time.

1110
01:18:40,797 --> 01:18:43,005
- Shut up, you!
- Miserable, bloody Romans!

1111
01:18:43,176 --> 01:18:45,334
No sense of humour.

1112
01:18:45,511 --> 01:18:46,554
Sorry, bit of a hurry.

1113
01:18:46,721 --> 01:18:51,182
Can you go straight out,
line on the left, one cross each? Now...

1114
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:03,187
Was it something I said?

1115
01:19:04,864 --> 01:19:06,464
Silence!

1116
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:13,121
This man commands a crack legion!

1117
01:19:17,293 --> 01:19:20,294
He ranks as high as any in Rome!

1118
01:19:24,968 --> 01:19:26,463
Crucifixion party?

1119
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:29,598
Morning.

1120
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:34,142
Now, we will be on show as we go through
the town, so let's not let the side down!

1121
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:37,514
Keep in a line, three lengths
between you and the man in front...

1122
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:39,516
...and a good, steady pace.

1123
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:43,476
Crosses over your left shoulders,
and if you keep your backs hard up...

1124
01:19:43,654 --> 01:19:47,153
...against the crossbeam
you'll be there in no time.

1125
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:48,439
All right, centurion!

1126
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:50,859
Crucifixion party!

1127
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:53,029
Wait for it.

1128
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:55,577
Crucifixion party!

1129
01:19:55,749 --> 01:19:59,877
By the left! Forward!

1130
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:05,664
You lucky bastards!

1131
01:20:07,094 --> 01:20:10,795
You lucky, jabby bastards!

1132
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:22,108
Let me shoulder your burden, brother!

1133
01:20:22,277 --> 01:20:24,277
Thank you.

1134
01:20:25,655 --> 01:20:28,692
- Hey! Hey!
- What do you think you're doing?

1135
01:20:28,867 --> 01:20:29,946
It's not my cross...

1136
01:20:30,118 --> 01:20:34,282
Shut up and get on with it!
Come on!

1137
01:20:34,456 --> 01:20:38,999
He had you there, mate, didn't he?
That'll teach you a lesson!

1138
01:20:39,628 --> 01:20:41,628
All right!

1139
01:20:41,963 --> 01:20:44,252
I will give you one more chance!

1140
01:20:44,424 --> 01:20:50,628
This time I want to hear
no Rubens, no Reginalds...

1141
01:20:50,805 --> 01:20:53,890
...no Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeers.

1142
01:20:54,059 --> 01:20:56,051
No Spencer Tracys!

1143
01:20:56,228 --> 01:20:58,138
Or we shall release no one!

1144
01:20:58,314 --> 01:20:59,974
Release Brian!

1145
01:21:00,149 --> 01:21:01,560
Yeah, that's a good one!

1146
01:21:01,734 --> 01:21:06,443
Release Brian! Release Brian!

1147
01:21:07,406 --> 01:21:09,280
Very well! That's it!

1148
01:21:09,450 --> 01:21:11,775
- Sir, we have got a Brian, sir.
- What?

1149
01:21:11,953 --> 01:21:17,195
- You just sent him for crucifixion, sir!
- Wait! Wait! We do have a Brian.

1150
01:21:17,375 --> 01:21:20,625
- Well, go and free him, straight away!
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1151
01:21:23,005 --> 01:21:28,925
Very well. I shall release Brian!

1152
01:21:32,473 --> 01:21:34,964
- Get a move on, there!
- Or what?

1153
01:21:35,142 --> 01:21:36,423
Or you'll be in trouble!

1154
01:21:36,602 --> 01:21:40,979
Oh, dear. You mean I might have to
give up being crucified in the afternoons?

1155
01:21:41,149 --> 01:21:43,522
- Shut up!
- That would be a blow, wouldn't it?

1156
01:21:43,694 --> 01:21:45,651
I wouldn't have nothing to do!

1157
01:21:45,821 --> 01:21:47,279
Thank you!

1158
01:21:50,367 --> 01:21:52,525
Are they gone?

1159
01:21:53,412 --> 01:21:57,659
We've got lumps of it around the back.

1160
01:21:57,833 --> 01:21:58,833
What?

1161
01:21:59,084 --> 01:22:01,789
Don't worry about him sir,
he's ma...

1162
01:22:06,842 --> 01:22:10,293
- He's mad, sir.
- Have they gone?

1163
01:22:19,646 --> 01:22:22,647
- Oh, come on.
- Yes, sir.

1164
01:22:23,275 --> 01:22:27,190
- Anyway, get on with the story.
- Well, I just never really liked them, so l...

1165
01:22:28,323 --> 01:22:31,027
Right! The motion to get on with it
passed with one abstention.

1166
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:33,656
I propose we go without further ado.
May I have a second?

1167
01:22:33,828 --> 01:22:35,986
- Let's just go.
- Yeah.

1168
01:22:51,638 --> 01:22:56,299
- Bloody Romans!
- Watch it! Still a few crosses left!

1169
01:22:58,019 --> 01:23:00,592
Up you go, big nose!

1170
01:23:00,772 --> 01:23:02,480
I'll get you for this, you bastard!

1171
01:23:02,649 --> 01:23:06,064
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah, don't worry. I never forget a face.

1172
01:23:06,235 --> 01:23:07,813
- No?
- I warn you.

1173
01:23:07,987 --> 01:23:11,238
I'm gonna punch you so hard,
you Roman git!

1174
01:23:11,408 --> 01:23:13,567
Shut up, you Jewish turd!

1175
01:23:13,744 --> 01:23:17,824
Who are you calling Jewish?
I'm not Jewish, I'm a Samaritan!

1176
01:23:17,998 --> 01:23:20,916
A Samaritan? This is supposed
to be a Jewish section!

1177
01:23:21,085 --> 01:23:24,833
It doesn't matter!
You're all gonna die in a day or two!

1178
01:23:25,005 --> 01:23:28,421
It may not matter to you,
but it matters to us. Doesn't it, darling?

1179
01:23:28,592 --> 01:23:29,837
Oh, rather!

1180
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:32,050
Under the terms
of the Roman occupancy...

1181
01:23:32,262 --> 01:23:35,263
...we're entitled to be crucified
in a purely Jewish area.

1182
01:23:35,432 --> 01:23:37,591
Pharisees separate from Sadducees!

1183
01:23:37,768 --> 01:23:39,891
And Swedish separate from Welsh!

1184
01:23:41,438 --> 01:23:44,973
All right, all right, all right!
We'll soon settle this!

1185
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:50,690
Hands up, all those who
don't want to be crucified here!

1186
01:23:50,864 --> 01:23:52,691
Right! Next!

1187
01:23:52,866 --> 01:23:55,952
- Look, it's not my cross.
- What?

1188
01:23:56,121 --> 01:23:58,409
It's not my cross,
I was holding it for someone.

1189
01:23:58,581 --> 01:24:03,125
- Just lie down, I haven't got all day!
- Of course. Look, I hate to make a fuss...

1190
01:24:03,295 --> 01:24:06,414
Look, we've had a busy day,
and there's 140 of you lot to get up.

1191
01:24:06,589 --> 01:24:09,045
- Is he Jewish?
- Will you be quiet?!

1192
01:24:09,217 --> 01:24:11,340
We don't want more
Samaritans around here.

1193
01:24:11,511 --> 01:24:12,756
Belt up!

1194
01:24:12,929 --> 01:24:16,512
- Will you let me down if he comes back?
- Yeah, yeah, we'll let you down.

1195
01:24:16,683 --> 01:24:18,307
- Next!
- You don't have to do this!

1196
01:24:18,476 --> 01:24:22,604
- You don't have to take orders!
- I like orders.

1197
01:24:44,378 --> 01:24:47,165
See? Not so bad once you're up.

1198
01:24:48,132 --> 01:24:51,999
- You're being rescued then, are you?
- It's a bit late for that now, isn't it?

1199
01:24:52,178 --> 01:24:54,135
No, we've got a couple of days up here.

1200
01:24:54,305 --> 01:24:56,463
Plenty of time.
Lots of people get rescued.

1201
01:24:57,683 --> 01:24:59,806
Oh, yeah.
My brother usually rescues me.

1202
01:24:59,977 --> 01:25:02,812
If he can keep off the tail
for more than 20 minutes.

1203
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:07,060
Randy little bugger.
Up and down like the Assyrian Empire.

1204
01:25:11,864 --> 01:25:14,236
Hello. Your family arrived then?

1205
01:25:14,408 --> 01:25:15,408
Reg!

1206
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:18,945
- Hello, sibling Brian.
- Thank God you've come, Reg.

1207
01:25:19,121 --> 01:25:23,617
I think I should point out in fairness
that we are not the rescue committee.

1208
01:25:23,793 --> 01:25:26,748
However, I have been asked to read
this prepared statement...

1209
01:25:26,922 --> 01:25:28,630
...on behalf of the movement.

1210
01:25:28,799 --> 01:25:32,049
"We, the People's Front of Judea,
brackets, officials, end brackets...

1211
01:25:32,219 --> 01:25:36,715
...do hereby convey our sincere fraternal
and sisterly greetings to you, Brian...

1212
01:25:36,890 --> 01:25:40,140
...on this occasion of your martyrdom."
- What?

1213
01:25:40,310 --> 01:25:43,928
"Your death will stand as a landmark
in the continuing struggle to liberate...

1214
01:25:44,106 --> 01:25:47,605
...the parent land from the hands
of the Roman imperialist aggressors...

1215
01:25:47,776 --> 01:25:51,026
...excluding those concerned with
drainage, medicine, roads, housing...

1216
01:25:51,196 --> 01:25:55,657
...education. And any other Romans
contributing to the welfare of Jews...

1217
01:25:55,826 --> 01:25:58,317
...of both sexes
and hermaphrodites."

1218
01:25:58,495 --> 01:26:01,413
Signed, "On behalf of the P.F.J.,
et cetera."

1219
01:26:01,581 --> 01:26:04,701
And I'd just like to add, on
a personal note, my own admiration...

1220
01:26:04,876 --> 01:26:10,252
...for what you're doing for us and what
must be, after all, for you, a difficult time.

1221
01:26:10,425 --> 01:26:14,837
- Reg! What are you going to do?
- Goodbye, Brian. And thanks.

1222
01:26:16,723 --> 01:26:18,715
All right, Brian. Keep it up, lad.

1223
01:26:18,891 --> 01:26:21,299
Terrific work, Brian.

1224
01:26:26,607 --> 01:26:28,434
Right. And:

1225
01:26:28,609 --> 01:26:30,816
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

1226
01:26:30,987 --> 01:26:33,063
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

1227
01:26:33,239 --> 01:26:36,026
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

1228
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,193
<i>And so say all of us</i>

1229
01:26:38,369 --> 01:26:41,039
<i>And so say all of...</i>

1230
01:26:44,125 --> 01:26:47,292
You bastards! You bastards!

1231
01:26:47,462 --> 01:26:50,581
- Where is Brian of Nazareth?
- You sanctimonious bastards!

1232
01:26:50,757 --> 01:26:54,671
- I have an order for his release.
- You stupid bastards!

1233
01:26:54,844 --> 01:26:56,885
- I'm Brian of Nazareth.
- What?

1234
01:26:57,056 --> 01:26:58,764
- I'm Brian of Nazareth.
- Take him down!

1235
01:26:58,932 --> 01:27:00,640
I'm Brian of Nazareth!

1236
01:27:01,268 --> 01:27:03,890
- I'm Brian!
- I'm Brian!

1237
01:27:04,063 --> 01:27:05,936
Look, look, I'm Brian!

1238
01:27:06,106 --> 01:27:09,191
- I'm Brian!
- I'm Brian and so is my wife!

1239
01:27:12,279 --> 01:27:16,858
- Right! Take him away and release him!
- No, I'm only joking. I'm not really Brian.

1240
01:27:17,034 --> 01:27:20,237
No, I'm not Brian! I was only...
It was a joke.

1241
01:27:20,412 --> 01:27:22,986
I'm only pulling your leg!
It's a joke!

1242
01:27:23,165 --> 01:27:25,573
I'm not him,
I'm just having you on!

1243
01:27:25,751 --> 01:27:29,452
Put me back!
Bloody Romans, can't take a joke.

1244
01:27:39,390 --> 01:27:41,182
The Judean People's Front!

1245
01:27:42,227 --> 01:27:44,599
The Judean People's Front!

1246
01:27:44,771 --> 01:27:47,371
Forward, all!

1247
01:27:51,736 --> 01:27:56,897
- Look out! The Judean People's Front!
- The Judean People's Front!

1248
01:27:57,075 --> 01:27:59,696
The Judean People's Front!

1249
01:28:03,748 --> 01:28:08,956
We are the Judean People's Front,
crack suicide squad.

1250
01:28:09,129 --> 01:28:13,423
Suicide squad, attack!

1251
01:28:21,975 --> 01:28:24,977
That showed them, huh?

1252
01:28:25,771 --> 01:28:28,262
You silly sods!

1253
01:28:28,441 --> 01:28:29,641
Brian!

1254
01:28:34,196 --> 01:28:35,596
Judith!

1255
01:28:36,407 --> 01:28:42,196
Terrific! Great! Reg explained it to me,
and I think it's great what you're doing.

1256
01:28:42,371 --> 01:28:46,784
Thank you, Brian. I'll never forget you.

1257
01:28:55,092 --> 01:28:57,797
So there you are!

1258
01:28:57,970 --> 01:29:00,212
I might have known
it would end up like this.

1259
01:29:00,389 --> 01:29:04,387
Just think of all the love
and affection I've wasted on you!

1260
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:07,265
Well, if that's how you treat
your poor, old mother...

1261
01:29:07,438 --> 01:29:10,855
...in the autumn years of her life,
all I can say is:

1262
01:29:11,026 --> 01:29:15,071
Go ahead. Be crucified.
See if I care.

1263
01:29:15,238 --> 01:29:20,280
- I might have known.
- Mum! Mum!

1264
01:29:20,452 --> 01:29:22,610
I don't know what
the world is coming to.

1265
01:29:27,918 --> 01:29:29,460
Cheer up, Brian!

1266
01:29:29,628 --> 01:29:31,834
You know what they say?

1267
01:29:32,005 --> 01:29:34,792
Some things in life are bad.

1268
01:29:34,967 --> 01:29:37,588
They can really make you mad.

1269
01:29:37,761 --> 01:29:41,675
Other things just make
you swear and curse.

1270
01:29:41,848 --> 01:29:44,221
<i>When you're chewing on life's gristle</i>

1271
01:29:44,393 --> 01:29:47,809
<i>Don't grumble</i>
<i>Give a whistle</i>

1272
01:29:47,980 --> 01:29:52,392
<i>And this'll help things</i>
<i>Turn out for the best</i>

1273
01:29:52,567 --> 01:29:54,524
<i>And</i>

1274
01:29:54,624 --> 01:30:00,524
<i>Always look on the bright side of life</i>

1275
01:30:02,787 --> 01:30:08,374
<i>Always look on the light side of life</i>

1276
01:30:10,044 --> 01:30:12,120
<i>If life seems jolly rotten</i>

1277
01:30:12,297 --> 01:30:14,088
<i>There's something you've forgotten</i>

1278
01:30:14,257 --> 01:30:17,957
<i>And that's to laugh and smile</i>
<i>And dance and sing</i>

1279
01:30:18,136 --> 01:30:19,963
<i>When you're feeling in the dumps</i>

1280
01:30:20,138 --> 01:30:22,344
<i>Don't be silly chumps</i>

1281
01:30:22,515 --> 01:30:25,551
<i>Just purse your lips and whistle</i>
<i>That's the thing</i>

1282
01:30:25,727 --> 01:30:32,180
<i>And always look on</i>
<i>The bright side of life</i>

1283
01:30:32,358 --> 01:30:33,958
Come on!

1284
01:30:34,610 --> 01:30:39,736
<i>Always look on the right side of life</i>

1285
01:30:42,411 --> 01:30:44,202
<i>For life is quite absurd</i>

1286
01:30:44,371 --> 01:30:46,115
<i>And death's the final word</i>

1287
01:30:46,290 --> 01:30:50,038
<i>You must always face</i>
<i>The curtain with a bow</i>

1288
01:30:50,210 --> 01:30:52,084
<i>Forget about your sin</i>

1289
01:30:52,254 --> 01:30:54,330
<i>Give the audience a grin</i>

1290
01:30:54,506 --> 01:30:57,591
<i>Enjoy it</i>
<i>It's your last chance anyhow</i>

1291
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:03,465
<i>So always look on</i>
<i>The bright side of death</i>

1292
01:31:06,727 --> 01:31:11,436
<i>Just before</i>
<i>You draw your terminal breath</i>

1293
01:31:14,610 --> 01:31:16,437
<i>Life's a piece of shit</i>

1294
01:31:16,612 --> 01:31:18,403
<i>When you look at it</i>

1295
01:31:18,572 --> 01:31:22,273
<i>Life's a laugh and death's a joke
<i>It's true</i>

1296
01:31:22,451 --> 01:31:24,159
<i>You'll see it's all a show</i>

1297
01:31:24,329 --> 01:31:26,203
<i>Keep 'em laughing as you go</i>

1298
01:31:26,373 --> 01:31:30,038
<i>Just remember that</i>
<i>The last laugh is on you</i>

1299
01:31:30,210 --> 01:31:36,497
<i>And always look on</i>
<i>The bright side of life</i>

1300
01:31:38,843 --> 01:31:43,838
<i>Always look on the right side of life</i>

1301
01:31:44,015 --> 01:31:46,720
Come on, Brian! Cheer up!

1302
01:31:46,893 --> 01:31:52,480
<i>Always look on the bright side of life</i>

1303
01:31:54,734 --> 01:31:59,527
<i>Always look on the bright side of life</i>

1304
01:31:59,698 --> 01:32:02,615
Worse things happen at sea,
you know?

1305
01:32:02,784 --> 01:32:05,904
<i>Always look on the bright side of life</i>

1306
01:32:06,079 --> 01:32:08,487
What have you got to lose?
You come from nothing...

1307
01:32:08,665 --> 01:32:10,658
...you're going back to nothing,
what have you lost?

1308
01:32:10,835 --> 01:32:12,210
Nothing!

1309
01:32:16,007 --> 01:32:18,711
Nothing will come from nothing,
you know what they say?

1310
01:32:18,884 --> 01:32:20,462
