1
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,739
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

2
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:41,702
First off, I'd like to thank this board for
taking the time to hear my proposal.

3
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:44,246
Now, we've all heard
of the legend of Atlantis,

4
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,415
a continent somewhere
in the mid-Atlantic

5
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,292
that was home
to an advanced civilization,

6
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,711
possessing technology
far beyond our own,

7
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,005
that, according to our friend Plato here,

8
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,591
was suddenly struck
by some cataclysmic event

9
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,217
that sank it beneath the sea.

10
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,012
Now, some of you may ask,
why Atlantis?

11
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,930
It's just a myth, isn't it?

12
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,140
Pure fantasy.

13
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:06,268
Well, that is where you'd be wrong.

14
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,605
10,000 years
before the Egyptians built the pyramids,

15
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,774
Atlantis had electricity,
advanced medicine,

16
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,860
even the power of flight.
Impossible, you say?

17
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,695
Well, no. No, not for them.

18
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,780
Numerous ancient cultures
all over the globe agree

19
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:21,617
that Atlantis possessed
a power source of some kind

20
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,994
more powerful than steam, than coal.

21
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,622
More powerful than our modern
internal combustion engines.

22
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:30,542
Gentlemen, I propose
that we find Atlantis,

23
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,294
find that power source,

24
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,379
and bring it back to the surface.

25
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,466
Now, this is a page
from an illuminated text

26
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,636
that describes a book called
The Shepherd's Journal,

27
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,639
said to have been
a firsthand account of Atlantis

28
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,140
and its exact whereabouts.

29
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,393
Now, based on a centuries-old
translation of a Norse text,

30
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,979
historians have believed
the Journal resides in Ireland.

31
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,941
But after comparing the text

32
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,944
to the runes on this Viking shield,

33
00:03:56,986 --> 00:04:01,073
I found that one of the letters
had been mistranslated.

34
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,408
So, by changing this letter

35
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,535
and inserting the correct one,

36
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,455
we find that The Shepherd's Journal,
the key to Atlantis,

37
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,875
lies not in Ireland, gentlemen,

38
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,503
but in Iceland.

39
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,547
Pause for effect.

40
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:21,093
Gentlemen, I'll take your questions now.

41
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:26,139
Would you gentlemen
please excuse me for a moment?

42
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,978
Cartography and Linguistics,
Milo Thatch speaking.

43
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,982
Yeah. Just a second.

44
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,699
Pardon me, Mr. Hickenbottom.

45
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,580
How's that? Is that better?

46
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,000
Yeah. You're welcome.

47
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,377
- And don't let it happen again.
- All right, bye.

48
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,380
Now, as you can see by the...

49
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,716
By this map...

50
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,509
Map that...

51
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,761
That I've drawn, I plotted the route

52
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,221
that will take myself and a crew

53
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,505
to the southern coast of Iceland
to retrieve the Journal.

54
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,226
Showtime.

55
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,104
Well, this is it.

56
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,273
I am finally getting out of the dungeon.

57
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,061
"Dear Mr. Thatch, this is to inform you"

58
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:57,606
"that your meeting today has been
moved up from 4:30 p.m. To 3:30 p.m."

59
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,067
What?

60
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,131
"Dear Mr. Thatch, due to your absence,"

61
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,738
"the board has voted
to reject your proposal."

62
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,074
"Have a nice weekend.
Mr. Harcourt's office."

63
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,242
They can't do this to me!

64
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,954
I swear, that young Thatch
gets crazier every year.

65
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,457
If I ever hear the word "Atlantis" again,

66
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,459
I'll step in front of a bus.

67
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,919
I'll push you.

68
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,629
- Mr. Harcourt!
- Good Lord!

69
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,798
- There he is!
- Members of the board... Wait.

70
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,467
- How did you find us?
- Mr. Harcourt, wait!

71
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,510
Head for the hills!

72
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,677
Where is a guard when you need him?

73
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,472
Mr. Harcourt, you gotta listen to me, sir!

74
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,808
Sir?

75
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,729
Wait! Mr. Harcourt!

76
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,483
Sir, I have new evidence that...
Please, Mr. Harcourt!

77
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,985
Stop! Sir, if you... Could you hold...

78
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,654
Thank you very much. Look at...

79
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:48,156
This museum funds
scientific expeditions

80
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,660
based on facts,
not legends and folklore.

81
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,829
Besides, we need you here.

82
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,123
- We depend on you.
- You do?

83
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,874
Yes. What with winter coming,

84
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,668
that boiler's going to need
a lot of attention.

85
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,044
- Boiler?
- Onward, Heinz!

86
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,214
But there... There's a journal!

87
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:07,008
It's in Iceland! I'm sure of it this time!

88
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,805
Sir, I really hoped
it wouldn't come to this,

89
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:16,184
but this is a letter of resignation.

90
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,437
If you reject my proposal, I'll...

91
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,649
I'll quit!

92
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,196
I mean it, sir.

93
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,198
If you refuse to fund my proposal...

94
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,324
You'll what?

95
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,034
Flush your career down the toilet,

96
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,327
just like your grandfather?

97
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,329
You have a lot of potential, Milo.

98
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,874
Don't throw it all away
chasing fairy tales.

99
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,376
But I can prove Atlantis exists!

100
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,044
You want to go on an expedition?

101
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,922
Here. Take a trolley
to the Potomac and jump in!

102
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,050
Maybe the cold water will
clear your head. Heinz!

103
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,477
I'm home.

104
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,062
Fluffy? Here, kitty.

105
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,276
Milo James Thatch?

106
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,863
Who... Who are you?
How did you get in here?

107
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:14,117
I came down the chimney.

108
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,119
My name is Helga Sinclair.

109
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,246
I'm acting on behalf of my employer,

110
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,541
who has a most intriguing
proposition for you.

111
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,293
Are you interested?

112
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,587
Your employer?

113
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,755
Who is your employer?

114
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,689
This way, please.

115
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,900
And don't drip on the Caravaggio.

116
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:48,610
Step lively.

117
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,279
Mr. Whitmore does not like
to be kept waiting.

118
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,824
You will address him
as "Mr. Whitmore" or "sir."

119
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,618
You will stand unless
asked to be seated.

120
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,382
Keep your sentences short
and to the point.

121
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,955
Are we clear?

122
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,209
And relax.

123
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,836
He doesn't bite... often.

124
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,303
Grandpa?

125
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,305
Finest explorer I ever met.

126
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,141
Preston Whitmore.
Pleasure to meet you, Milo.

127
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:22,978
Join me in a little yoga?

128
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,896
No, no. Thank you.

129
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,356
Did you really know my grandfather?

130
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,484
Oh, yeah. Met old Thaddeus
back in Georgetown.

131
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,821
Class of '66. We stayed close friends
till the end of his days.

132
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,948
Even dragged me along

133
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,741
on some of his danged fool expeditions.

134
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,369
Thatch was crazy as a fruit bat, he was.

135
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,495
He spoke of you often.

136
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,664
Funny. He never mentioned you.

137
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,000
He wouldn't.
He knew how much I like my privacy.

138
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,378
I keep a low profile.

139
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,297
Mr. Whitmore, should I be
wondering why I'm here?

140
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,381
Look on that table.

141
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,385
It's for you.

142
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,597
It's from my grandfather.

143
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,640
He brought that package
to me years ago.

144
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,183
He said if anything
were to happen to him,

145
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,019
I should give it to you
when you were ready.

146
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,937
Whatever that means.

147
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,398
It...

148
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,025
It can't be.

149
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,610
It's The Shepherd's Journal.

150
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,696
Mr. Whitmore, this journal is the key

151
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,906
to finding the lost continent of Atlantis!

152
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,825
Atlantis.

153
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,035
I wasn't born yesterday, son.

154
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,494
No, no, no. Look. Look at this.

155
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,872
Coordinates. Clues. It's all right here.

156
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,540
Yeah, looks like gibberish to me.

157
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,418
That's because it's been written
in a dialect that no longer exists.

158
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,837
- So it's useless.
- No, no, just difficult.

159
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,881
I've spent my whole life
studying dead languages.

160
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,215
It's not gibberish to me.

161
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,009
It's probably a fake.

162
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,021
Mr. Whitmore,
my grandfather would have known

163
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,222
if this were a fake. I would know.

164
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:44,309
I will stake everything I own,
everything that I believe in,

165
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,478
that this is
the genuine Shepherd's Journal.

166
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,563
All right, all right.
So, what do you want to do with it?

167
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,148
Well, I'll get funding.

168
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,734
- I mean, I'll... The museum...
- They'll never believe you.

169
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,570
I'll show them! I will make them believe.

170
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,696
Like you did today?

171
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,240
Yes! Well, no. How did you...

172
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,992
Forget about them, okay? Never mind!

173
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,869
I will find Atlantis on my own.

174
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,621
I mean, if I have to rent a rowboat!

175
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,290
Congratulations, Milo.

176
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,085
This is exactly what I wanted to hear.

177
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,670
But forget the rowboat, son.

178
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,882
We'll travel in style.

179
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,096
It's all been arranged,
the whole ball of wax.

180
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,305
Why?

181
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,140
For years, your granddad bent my ear

182
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,684
with stories about that old book.

183
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,976
I didn't buy it for a minute.

184
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,562
So, finally, I got fed up
and I made a bet with the old coot.

185
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,607
I said, "Thatch, if you ever
actually find that so-called journal",

186
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,290
"not only will I finance the expedition,"

187
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,027
"but I'll kiss you full on the mouth."

188
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,446
Imagine my embarrassment
when he found the darn thing.

189
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,282
Now, I know
your grandfather's gone, Milo,

190
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,575
God rest his soul,

191
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,703
but Preston Whitmore
is a man who keeps his word.

192
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:45,829
You hear that, Thatch?

193
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:49,457
I'm going to the afterlife
with a clear conscience, by thunder!

194
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,175
Your grandpa was a great man.

195
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,386
You probably don't realize how great.

196
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,973
Those buffoons at the museum
dragged him down,

197
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,641
made a laughing stock of him.

198
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,310
He died a broken man.

199
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:13,148
If I could bring back
just one shred of proof,

200
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,441
that'd be enough for me.

201
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,318
Thatch.

202
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,822
What are we standing around for?
We got work to do.

203
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,407
But, Mr. Whitmore,
you know, in order to do

204
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,075
what you're proposing,
you're gonna need a crew.

205
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,160
Taken care of.

206
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,120
You'll need engineers and geologists.

207
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,122
Got 'em all. The best of the best.

208
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,624
Gaetan Moliere,
geology and excavation.

209
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,168
The man has a nose for dirt.

210
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,086
Vincenzo Santorini, demolitions.

211
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,046
Busted him out of a Turkish prison.

212
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,048
Audrey Ramirez.
Don't let her age fool you.

213
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,760
She's forgotten more about engines
than you and I will ever know.

214
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,553
They're the same crew that
brought the Journal back.

215
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,181
- Where was it?
- Iceland.

216
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,224
I knew it! I knew it!

217
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,311
All we need now is
an expert in gibberish.

218
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,354
So, it's decision time.

219
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,523
You can build on
the foundation your grandfather left you

220
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,358
or you can go back to your boiler room.

221
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,697
- This is for real.
- Now you're catching on.

222
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,742
All right. Okay. I'll have to quit my job.

223
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,410
It's done. You resigned this afternoon.

224
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,336
- I did?
- Yep. Don't like to leave loose ends.

225
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,091
My apartment.
I'm gonna have to give notice.

226
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,624
- Taken care of.
- My clothes?

227
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,875
- Packed.
- My books?

228
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,418
- In storage.
- My cat?

229
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,379
My gosh.

230
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,507
Your granddad had a saying.

231
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,885
"Our lives are remembered,
by the gifts we leave our children."

232
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,222
This journal is his gift to you, Milo.

233
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,433
Atlantis is waiting.

234
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,310
What do you say?

235
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,270
I'm your man, Mr. Whitmore.

236
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,772
You will not regret this.

237
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,190
Boy, I am so excited,

238
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,400
I can't even hold it in.

239
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,077
Carrots. Why is there always carrots?

240
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,829
I didn't even eat carrots.

241
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,748
Attention. All hands to the launch bay.

242
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,584
To whoever took the "L"
from the Motor Pool sign,

243
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,003
we are all very amused.

244
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,423
Excuse me? I need to report in?

245
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,758
Yes, Mr. Thatch?

246
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,343
It's you!

247
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,262
Blondie, I got a bone to pick with you.

248
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,388
Hold that thought.

249
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,973
What is it this time, Cookie?

250
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:13,601
You done stuffed my wagon full to
busting with non-essentials.

251
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,103
Look at all this.

252
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:18,106
Cinnamon, oregano, cilantro.

253
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,567
What in the cockadoodle is cilantro?

254
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,735
And what is this?

255
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:23,862
That would be lettuce.

256
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,030
Lettuce? Lettuce?

257
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,740
It's a vegetable, Cookie.

258
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,784
The men need
the four basic food groups.

259
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,953
I got your four basic food groups!

260
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,830
Beans, bacon, whiskey, and lard!

261
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,333
All right, cowboy.
Pack it up and move it out.

262
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,795
Attention. All hands to the launch bay.

263
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,172
Final loading in progress.

264
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,100
Hey, Junior.

265
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,020
If you're looking for the pony rides,
they're back there.

266
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,147
Excuse me. Excuse me?

267
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,566
You dropped your dynamite.

268
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,153
What else have you got in there?

269
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:10,325
Gunpowder,
nitroglycerin, notepads,

270
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:13,494
fuses, wicks, glue, and...

271
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,330
Paper clips. Big ones.

272
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,916
You know, just office supplies.

273
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,626
Milo! Where you been?

274
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,919
I want you to meet Commander Rourke.

275
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,123
He led the Iceland team
that brought the Journal back.

276
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,631
Milo Thatch.

277
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,383
Pleasure to meet the grandson
of old Thaddeus.

278
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,385
I see you got that journal. Nice pictures,

279
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,930
but I prefer a good western myself.

280
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,181
Pretty impressive?

281
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,643
Boy, when you settle a bet,
you settle a bet.

282
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,269
Well, your granddad always believed

283
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,605
you couldn't put a price
on the pursuit of knowledge.

284
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,191
Well, believe me,
this'll be small change

285
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,360
compared to the value
of what we're gonna learn on this trip.

286
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,820
Yes, this should be
enriching for all of us.

287
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,739
Attention, all personnel.

288
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:52,533
Launch will commence in 15 minutes.

289
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:53,826
- Mr. Whitmore.
- Rourke.

290
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:54,869
It's time.

291
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,497
- Bye, Mr. Whitmore!
- Make us proud, boy!

292
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,540
Rig ship for dive!

293
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,959
Aye, sir! Rig ship for dive.

294
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,585
Lieutenant, take her down.

295
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,295
Diving officer, submerge the ship.

296
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,214
- Aye!
- Make the depth one-five-zero feet.

297
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,216
Make the depth one-five-zero feet.

298
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,551
Dive, dive! Five degrees down bubble.

299
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,428
- Take us down.
- Take us down!

300
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,805
Attention.

301
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,266
Tonight's supper will be baked beans.

302
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,018
Musical program to follow.

303
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,478
Who wrote this?

304
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:12,530
You have disturbed the dirt.

305
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,949
- Pardon me?
- You have disturbed the dirt!

306
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,243
Dirt from around the globe,
spanning the centuries!

307
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,619
What have you done?

308
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,039
England must never merge with France!

309
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,291
- What's it doing in my bed?
- You ask too many questions.

310
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,775
Who are you? Who sent you?
Speak up!

311
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,295
- Me? I'm...
- I will know soon enough.

312
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,713
Hey, hey, hey! Let go!

313
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,590
Do not be such a crybaby. Hold still.

314
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,467
There you are.

315
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,636
Now, tell me your story, my little friend.

316
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,014
Parchment fiber from
the Nile delta circa 500 B.C.

317
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,140
Lead pencil, number 2.

318
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,641
Paint flecks of a type
used in government buildings.

319
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,226
You have a cat,
shorthaired Persian, two years old,

320
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,478
third in a litter of seven.

321
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:47,482
There are all the microscopic
fingerprints of the mapmaker.

322
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,485
And linguist.

323
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,612
- Hey, how did you...
- This is an outrage!

324
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,864
You must leave at once!
Out, out, out, out, out!

325
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,408
Sat in the dirt, didn't you?

326
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,327
Moliere, now what have I told you

327
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,745
about playing nice with the other kids?

328
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:03,289
Get back. I've got soap,
and I'm not afraid to use it.

329
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,626
Back, foul creature!
Back to the pit from which you came!

330
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,045
The name's Sweet.

331
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,713
Joshua Sweet. Medical officer.

332
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,006
Yeah, Milo Thatch.

333
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,966
Milo Thatch. You're my 3:00.

334
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,510
Well, no time like the present.

335
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:16,969
- Oh, boy.
- Nice, isn't it?

336
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,513
The catalog says that this little beauty

337
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,181
can saw through a femur in 28 seconds.

338
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,808
I'm betting I can cut that time in half.

339
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,351
Now, stick out your
tongue and say, "Ah."

340
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,852
Oh, no, really. I have a...

341
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,020
So, where you from?

342
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,438
Really? I have family up that way.

343
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,483
Beautiful country up there.
Do you do any fishing?

344
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,401
Me? I hate fishing. I hate fish.

345
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,966
Hate the taste, hate the smell,
and hate all them little bones.

346
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,948
Here, I'm gonna need you
to fill these up.

347
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,366
With what?

348
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:41,035
Will Milo Thatch
please report to the bridge?

349
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,161
Thank you.

350
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,913
I mean, nice meeting you.

351
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,874
Nice meeting you, too.

352
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,297
So I says to him,
"What's wrong with my meatloaf?"

353
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,757
And he says to me...

354
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,885
Hold on a second, Margie,
I got another call.

355
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,221
Sir, we're approaching coordinates.

356
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,223
Hello, Margie?
Yeah, so anyways, he says...

357
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,016
All right, let's have a look around.

358
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,579
Aye, sir. Set course to two-four-zero.

359
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,686
Aye, aye, sir.

360
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:07,979
15 degrees down angle
on the bow planes.

361
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,814
Come right two-four-zero.

362
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,942
Welcome to the bridge, Mr. Thatch.

363
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,193
Okay, everybody,

364
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,736
I want you to give Mr. Thatch

365
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,405
your undivided attention.

366
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,741
Good afternoon.
Can everyone hear me okay?

367
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,914
Okay, how about some slides?

368
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,667
The first slide is
a depiction of a creature.

369
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,377
A creature so frightening

370
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,881
that sailors were said
to be driven mad by the mere sight of it.

371
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,552
I'm sorry. That's wrong.

372
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,597
Geez, I used to take lunch money
from guys like this.

373
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,098
Anyway, this... Okay.

374
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,934
This is an illustration of the Leviathan,

375
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,520
the creature guarding
the entrance to Atlantis.

376
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,938
With something like that,

377
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,357
I would have white wine, I think.

378
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,109
It's a mythical sea serpent.

379
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,527
He's described in The Book of Job.

380
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,612
The Bible says,

381
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,176
"Out of his mouth go burning lights,"

382
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,948
"sparks of fire shoot out."

383
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,243
But more likely, it's a carving or
a sculpture to frighten the superstitious.

384
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,746
So we find this masterpiece.
Then what?

385
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,206
When do we dig?

386
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,624
Actually, we don't have to dig.

387
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,958
You see, according to the Journal,

388
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,919
the path to Atlantis
will take us down a tunnel

389
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,296
at the bottom of the ocean,
and we'll come up a curve

390
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,964
into an air pocket right here,

391
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,257
where we'll find the remnants

392
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,509
of an ancient highway
that will lead us to Atlantis.

393
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,011
Kind of like the grease trap in your sink.

394
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,597
Cartographer, linguist, plumber.

395
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,015
Hard to believe he's still single.

396
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,643
- You said there'd be digging.
- Go away, Mole.

397
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,353
Captain, you'd better
come look at this, sir.

398
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,021
Okay, class dismissed.

399
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,564
Give me exterior lights.

400
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,990
Look at that.

401
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,159
There are ships here from every era.

402
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,435
Commander, I think
you should hear this.

403
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,273
Commander? Commander?

404
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,025
"Enter the lair of the Leviathan."

405
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,318
Commander?

406
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,903
"There you will find the path
to the gateway."

407
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,364
- Commander?
- Yes, Mrs. Packard. What is it?

408
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,533
I'm picking up something
on the hydrophone.

409
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,743
- I think you should hear.
- Put it on speakers.

410
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,879
What is it? A pod of whales?

411
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,423
Bigger.

412
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,590
It sounds metallic.

413
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:42,967
Could be an echo off one of the rocks.

414
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,720
Do you want to do my job? Be my guest.

415
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,596
Is it just me, or is that getting louder?

416
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,062
Well, whatever it was, it's gone now.

417
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,814
Helmsman! Bring us about.

418
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,618
Tighten our search pattern
and slow us to...

419
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,404
Out of the way!

420
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,706
Tell Cookie to melt the butter
and break out the bibs.

421
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,833
I want this lobster served up
on a silver platter.

422
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,544
Load the torpedo bays!
Sub pod crews, battle stations!

423
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,380
Battle stations!

424
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,216
Steady, boys. Don't panic.

425
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,767
Jiminy Christmas! It's a machine!

426
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,606
Wait, wait!

427
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,067
Launch subpods!

428
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,568
Subpods away!

429
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,033
Fire!

430
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,663
We're free. All ahead full.

431
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,171
Fire torpedoes!

432
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,018
Get me the bridge!

433
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,145
Sir, it's Engineering on four.

434
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,314
Rourke! We took a big hit down here,

435
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,982
and we're taking on water fast.

436
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,110
I don't want to be around
when it hits the boilers.

437
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,319
How much time do we have?

438
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,987
Twenty minutes, if the bulkhead holds.

439
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,323
You better make that five.

440
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,908
You heard the lady. Let's move!

441
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,493
Move! Where? Move where?

442
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,702
Packard, sound the alarm!

443
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,995
He took his suitcase?

444
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,997
Marge, honey,
I don't think he's coming back.

445
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,833
- Packard!
- I have to call you back.

446
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,292
No, no, I'll call you.

447
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,839
All hands, abandon ship.

448
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,383
Move it, people!
Sometime today would be nice!

449
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,469
Come on! Everybody
grab a seat and buckle in.

450
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,388
Lieutenant, get us out of here!

451
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,852
- Lieutenant!
- I'm working on it!

452
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:07,903
Hang on.

453
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:20,666
Where to, Mr. Thatch?

454
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,127
We're looking for
a big crevice of some kind.

455
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,420
There! Up ahead.

456
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,755
All craft, make your mark
20 degrees down angle.

457
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,924
Roger! 20 degrees down angle.

458
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,217
Right behind you!

459
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,681
- Sacré bleu!
- We're getting killed out here!

460
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,151
Look out!

461
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,072
It's only a grease trap.
It's just like a sink.

462
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,991
It's only a grease trap.
It's just like a sink!

463
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,300
Seven hours ago,
we started this expedition

464
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,595
with 200 of the finest men and women
I've ever known.

465
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,056
We're all that's left.

466
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,350
I won't sugarcoat it, gentlemen.

467
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,394
We have a crisis on our hands.

468
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,854
But we've been up
this particular creek before,

469
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,607
and we've always come through,
paddle or no paddle.

470
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,151
I see no reason
to change that policy now.

471
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:14,280
From here on in,
everyone pulls double duty.

472
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,657
Everyone drives, everyone works.

473
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,953
Looks like all our chances for survival
rest with you, Mr. Thatch.

474
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:22,997
You and that little book.

475
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,832
We're all gonna die.

476
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,834
Okay, people. Saddle up.

477
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,712
Lieutenant, I want this convoy
moving five minutes ago.

478
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:30,879
Moliere, you're on point.

479
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,881
No, Vinny, Audrey's taking the oiler.

480
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,341
You know the rules. I want you 50 yards

481
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,135
behind that truck at all times.

482
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,220
And, Packard, put out that cigarette.

483
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,731
Are you sure you're checked out
on this class of vehicle?

484
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,233
Can you drive a truck?

485
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,403
Of course I can drive a truck.

486
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,363
I mean, sure, you got your steering,

487
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,823
and your gas, and your brake,

488
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:02,536
and of course, this metal-looking thing.

489
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,706
Okay, so it was a bumper car
at Coney Island,

490
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,124
but it's the same basic principle!

491
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,673
Come on! Move it!

492
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,675
Sorry about... Sorry about that.

493
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,093
Come on, civilian!

494
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,551
You didn't just drink that, did you?

495
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:18,654
That's not good.

496
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:19,905
That's nitroglycerin.

497
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,031
Don't move.

498
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,783
Don't breathe.

499
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:25,786
Don't do anything, except pray, maybe.

500
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,246
Boom!

501
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,810
Yeah.

502
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,993
Good night!
Will you look at the size of this?

503
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,078
It's gotta be half a mile high, at least.

504
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,747
It must have taken hundred...

505
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,666
No, thousands of years
to carve this thing.

506
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,339
Hey, look, I made a bridge.

507
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,883
It only took me, like, what?

508
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:23,010
10 seconds, 11, tops.

509
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,697
Looks like we have a little roadblock.

510
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,199
Vinny, what do you think?

511
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:48,744
I could un-roadblock that
if I had about 200 of these.

512
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:51,789
Problem is, I only got about 10.

513
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,208
Plus, you know, five of my own,

514
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:58,128
and a couple of cherry bombs,
a road flare.

515
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,882
Hey, too bad we don't have
some nitroglycerin, Milo?

516
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,552
Looks like we're gonna have to dig.

517
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,931
It will be my pleasure.

518
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,195
Stupid...

519
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,072
Stupid!

520
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:26,865
I don't understand it.

521
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,784
I just tuned this thing up this morning.

522
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,119
It looks like the rotor's shot!

523
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,747
I'm gonna have to pull
a spare from one of the trucks.

524
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,707
- Can I...
- No toques nada!

525
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,917
I'll be right back.

526
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,802
She lives!

527
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,512
Hey, what'd you do?

528
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:51,098
Well, you know, the boiler in this baby

529
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,183
is a Humac model P-54 stroke 813.

530
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:56,436
Now, we got the 814
back at the museum.

531
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,730
The heating cores
on the whole Humac line

532
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,774
have always been a little,
you know, temperamental,

533
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,943
so sometimes you gotta... Boom!

534
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,027
Persuade 'em a little.

535
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,529
Yeah, yeah. Thank you very much.

536
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:06,697
Shut up.

537
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,409
Two for flinching.

538
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,335
This is it. It's gotta be.

539
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,921
All right, we'll make camp here.

540
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,381
Why is it glowing?

541
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,217
It is a natural phosphorescence.

542
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:30,554
That thing is going to
keep me up all night, I know it.

543
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,472
Come and get it!

544
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,684
For the appetizer, Caesar salad,

545
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:39,605
escargot, and your oriental spring rolls.

546
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,565
- Yuck.
- I wanted the escargot.

547
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:42,816
Knock yourself out.

548
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,611
There you go, Milo.

549
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,321
Put some meat on them bones.

550
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:50,198
Thanks, Cookie.
That looks greasier than usual.

551
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,367
You like it? Well, have some more.

552
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,494
You're so skinny,
if you turned sideways

553
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,619
and stuck out your tongue,
you'd look like a zipper.

554
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,549
You know,
we've been pretty tough on the kid.

555
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,063
What do you say
we cut him some slack?

556
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,460
Yeah, you're right.

557
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,712
Hey, Milo!
Why don't you come sit with us?

558
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,881
Really? You don't mind?

559
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,299
Nah. Park it here.

560
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,009
Gee, this is great.

561
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,334
I mean, you know,
it's an honor to be included in your...

562
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:18,727
- Mole!
- Forgive me.

563
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,188
I could not resist.

564
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,231
Hey, Milo,
don't you ever close that book?

565
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,192
Yeah, you must've read it
a dozen times by now.

566
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,028
I know, but this...
This doesn't make any sense.

567
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,238
See, in this passage here, the shepherd

568
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,573
seems to be leading up to something.

569
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,283
He calls it the heart of Atlantis.

570
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,078
It could be the power source
the legends refer to.

571
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,455
But then, it just... It cuts off.

572
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,140
It's almost like there's a missing page.

573
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,750
Kid, relax.

574
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,085
We don't get paid overtime.

575
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,544
I know, I know.

576
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,380
Sometimes I get a little carried away.

577
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,715
But hey, you know,
that's what this is all about, right?

578
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,385
I mean, discovery,
teamwork, adventure.

579
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,429
Unless, maybe...

580
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,515
You're just in it for the money.

581
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,643
- Money.
- Money.

582
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,561
I'm gonna say... Money.

583
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,940
Well, I guess
I set myself up for that one.

584
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,359
What, is something
wrong with your neck?

585
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,361
Oh, yeah, I must've hurt it when...

586
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:11,697
Better?

587
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,573
Yeah!

588
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:15,534
Hey, how'd you learn how to do that?

589
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,577
- An Arapaho medicine man.
- Get outta here.

590
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,913
Born and raised with 'em.
My father was an army medic.

591
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:23,000
He settled down in the Kansas
Territory after he met my mother.

592
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,459
- No kidding.
- Nope.

593
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,294
I got a sheepskin from Howard U,

594
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,422
and a bearskin from old Iron Cloud.

595
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:30,298
Halfway through medical school,
I was drafted.

596
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,884
One day I'm studying gross anatomy
in the classroom,

597
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,387
the next, I'm sewing up Rough Riders
on San Juan Hill.

598
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,596
Main course.

599
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,973
I couldn't eat another bite.

600
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,266
I'm watching my weight.

601
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,767
Don't you worry.

602
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,353
It'll keep and keep and keep.

603
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:47,024
Thank God I lost my sense of taste
years ago.

604
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,031
Aren't you going to pitch up your tent?

605
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,699
I did.

606
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,008
I guess I'm still a little rusty at this.

607
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,871
I haven't gone camping since...

608
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,456
Well, since the last time
my grandpa took me.

609
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,374
I never got to meet your grandfather.

610
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,584
What was he like?

611
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,210
Where do you start?

612
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,296
He was like a father to me, really.

613
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:13,133
My parents died when I was
a little kid, and he took me in.

614
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,803
What?

615
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,722
Well, I was just thinking.

616
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,474
One time, when I was eight,

617
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:22,350
we were hiking along this stream,

618
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:25,479
and I saw something
shining in the water.

619
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,147
It was a genuine arrowhead.

620
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,858
Well, you'd think I'd found
a lost civilization

621
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,818
the way Grandpa carried on about it.

622
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:34,154
It wasn't until I was older
that I realized that the arrowhead

623
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,438
was just some compressed shale

624
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,782
mixed with zinc pyrite that had fractured

625
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,575
into an isosceletic triangulate.

626
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,203
That is so cute!

627
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,122
Say, Audrey, no offense,

628
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,500
but how does a teenager
become the chief mechanic

629
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,126
of a multimillion dollar expedition?

630
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,295
Well, I took this job
when my dad retired.

631
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,256
But the funny thing was
he always wanted sons, right?

632
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,133
One to run his machine shop
and the other

633
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,177
to be middleweight boxing champion.

634
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,262
But he got my sister and me instead.

635
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,265
So, what happened to your sister?

636
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:04,893
She's 24-0 with a shot
at the title next month.

637
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,062
Anyway, I'm saving up

638
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:09,397
so my papi and I
can open another shop.

639
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,108
Forget your jammies, Mrs. Packard?

640
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,818
I sleep in the nude.

641
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,653
You're gonna want a pair of these.

642
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,029
She sleepwalks.

643
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,281
Well, as far as me goes,

644
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,242
I just like to blow things up.

645
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,202
Come on, Vinny, tell the kid the truth.

646
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,373
My family owned a flower shop.

647
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,291
We would sell roses,

648
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,336
carnations, baby's breath, you name it.

649
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,171
One day, I'm making

650
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:36,883
about three dozen corsages
for this prom.

651
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,261
You know, the one
they put on their wrist.

652
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,930
And everybody, they come.
"Where is it?"

653
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,558
"When is it?"
"Does it match my dress?"

654
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,560
It's a nightmare.

655
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:49,980
Anyway, I guess
there was this leak next door

656
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:52,023
of gas or what. Boom!

657
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,441
No more Chinese laundry.

658
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,861
Blew me right through the front window.

659
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:58,363
It was like a sign from God.

660
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,740
I found myself that boom.

661
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,164
What's Mole's story?

662
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,166
Trust me on this one.
You don't wanna know.

663
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,002
Audrey, don't tell him. You shouldn't
have told me, but you did.

664
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,421
And now, I'm telling you,
you don't wanna know.

665
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,245
The redhead's got a gun.

666
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,514
Holy...

667
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,064
Fire.

668
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:17,651
Fire!

669
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,324
I'm gonna kill him.

670
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,159
Thatch, go back to bed.

671
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:29,955
Get some water on that fire!

672
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:30,997
No time!

673
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,374
Get us into those caves!

674
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,625
Move it! Move it! Move it!

675
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,674
Gertie, pull!

676
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,972
Milo, jump! Right now!

677
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,037
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

678
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,441
All right, who's not dead? Sound off.

679
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:45,071
Danged lightning bugs
done bit me on my sit upon.

680
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:47,657
Somebody's gonna have to
suck out that poison.

681
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,367
Now, don't everybody jump up at once.

682
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,495
Audrey, give me a damage report.

683
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,831
Not as bad as it could have been.

684
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,458
We totaled rigs two and seven,

685
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,835
but the digger looks like it'll still run.

686
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:01,671
Lucky for us
we landed in something soft.

687
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,590
Pumice ash.

688
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:06,634
We are standing at the base
of a dormant volcano.

689
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,139
It just keeps going.

690
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,932
Maybe that's our ticket outta here.

691
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,934
Maybe not.

692
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:19,356
The magma has solidified
in the bowels of the volcano,

693
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,191
effectively blocking the exit.

694
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,985
I got the same problem with sauerkraut.

695
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,612
Hold on. Back up.

696
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,615
Are you saying this whole volcano
can blow at any time?

697
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:29,908
No, no, no, no.

698
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,953
That would take
an explosive force of great magnitude.

699
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,627
Maybe I should do this later?

700
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,962
If we could blow the top off of that thing,

701
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,131
we'd have a straight shot to the surface.

702
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,966
Mr. Thatch, what do you think?

703
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,134
Mr. Thatch?

704
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:50,553
Thatch?

705
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,687
Hey, wait!

706
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,693
Who are you? Where are you going?

707
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:48,778
Come back!

708
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,037
Hey, wait a minute!

709
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,664
Who are you?

710
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,776
Sweet mother of Jefferson Davis!

711
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,320
It's beautiful.

712
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,572
Milo, I gotta hand it to you.

713
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:33,907
You really came through.

714
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:38,912
I take that back.

715
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,164
Holy cats! Who are these guys?

716
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:44,417
- They gotta be Atlanteans.
- What? That's impossible!

717
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,669
I seen this back in the Dakota.

718
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,506
They can smell fear
just by looking at ya.

719
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,673
So, keep quiet.

720
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,766
I think it's talking to you.

721
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,631
Parlez-vous français?

722
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,715
Oui, monsieur!

723
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,133
They speak my language!

724
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,385
Pardon, mademoiselle.

725
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,762
Voulez-vous...

726
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,348
I like her.

727
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:42,267
'Bout time someone hit him.

728
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:43,601
I'm just sorry it wasn't me.

729
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,314
How do they know all these languages?

730
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:51,150
Their language must be
based on a root dialect.

731
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:52,819
It's just like the Tower of Babel.

732
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,946
Well, maybe English
is in there somewhere.

733
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:58,157
We are explorers
from the surface world.

734
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,326
We come in peace.

735
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,371
Welcome to the city of Atlantis.

736
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:06,666
Come. You must speak
with my father now.

737
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:09,669
Squad "B," head back
to the shaft and salvage what you can.

738
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,963
- Yes, sir!
- We'll rendezvous in 24 hours.

739
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,756
Let's move it. You heard him.

740
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,011
I'm so excited!

741
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,385
Now, what's really amazing is that

742
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,900
if you deconstructed Latin,
you overlaid it

743
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:35,069
with a little Sumerian,
throw in a dash of Thessalonian,

744
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,155
you'd be getting close to
their basic grammatical structure.

745
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:38,573
Or at least you'd be
in the same ballpark...

746
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:41,993
- Someone's having a good time.
- Like a kid at Christmas.

747
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:46,414
Commander, there were
not supposed to be people down here.

748
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:47,707
This changes everything.

749
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,542
This changes nothing.

750
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:51,836
Take that, Mr. Harcourt!

751
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:51,771
Your Majesty?

752
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,106
On behalf of my crew,

753
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:56,025
may I say it is an honor
to be welcomed to your city.

754
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,652
Excuse me? Commander?

755
00:44:57,736 --> 00:45:01,155
You presume much
to think you are welcome here.

756
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,200
Oh, sir, we have come
a long way looking for...

757
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:08,579
I know what you seek,
and you will not find it here.

758
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,998
Your journey has been in vain.

759
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:14,293
But we are peaceful explorers,
men of science.

760
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,631
And yet you bring weapons.

761
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:22,969
Our weapons allow us to remove
obstacles we may encounter.

762
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:27,890
Some obstacles cannot be
removed with a mere show of force.

763
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:32,854
Return to your people.
You must leave Atlantis at once.

764
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,314
Oh, Your Majesty, be reasonable.

765
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,150
- Sir...
- Not now, son.

766
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,819
Trust me on this.
We better do as he says.

767
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,700
May I respectfully request
that we stay one night, sir?

768
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:48,619
That would give us
time to rest, resupply,

769
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:50,246
and be ready to travel by morning.

770
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,083
Very well. One night.

771
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,210
That is all.

772
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:58,379
Well, thank you, Your Majesty.

773
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:08,389
Your heart has softened, Kida.

774
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:11,684
A thousand years ago,
you would have slain them on sight.

775
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,228
A thousand years ago,
the streets were lit,

776
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:17,148
and our people did not
have to scavenge for food

777
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,608
at the edge of a crumbling city!

778
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:20,193
The people are content.

779
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,195
They do not know any better!

780
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:24,906
We were once a great people.
Now we live in ruins.

781
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,700
The kings of our past would weep

782
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,535
if they could see how far we have fallen.

783
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:32,163
- Kida.
- If these outsiders

784
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:35,208
can unlock the secrets of our past,

785
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,210
perhaps we can save our future.

786
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:42,131
What they have to teach us
we have already learned.

787
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,717
Our way of life is dying.

788
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:47,386
Our way of life is preserved.

789
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:53,059
Kida, when you take the throne,
you will understand.

790
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,730
- So, how'd it go?
- Well,

791
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,483
the King and his daughter
don't exactly see eye to eye.

792
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,860
She seems to like us okay,
but the King...

793
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,623
I don't know. I think
he's hiding something.

794
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:08,074
Well, if he's hiding something,
I want to know what it is.

795
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,535
- Someone needs to talk to that girl.
- I will go!

796
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,412
- Someone with good people skills.
- I will do it!

797
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:15,623
- Someone who won't scare her away.
- I volunteer!

798
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:17,667
Someone who can speak the language.

799
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,669
For the good of the mission, I will go!

800
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:22,463
Good man, Thatch.
Thanks for volunteering.

801
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,260
Go get 'em, tiger.

802
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,768
Okay, Milo, don't take no for an answer.

803
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,019
"Look, I have some questions for you,

804
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,480
"and I'm not leaving this city
until they're answered!" Yeah, that's it.

805
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:40,982
That's good, that's good.

806
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,614
I have some questions for you,

807
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:51,659
and you are not leaving this city
until they are answered.

808
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,704
- Yeah, well, I... Okay.
- Come with me.

809
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:05,548
Oh, there is so much
to ask about your world.

810
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:08,175
You are a scholar, are you not?

811
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,970
Judging from your diminished
physique and large forehead,

812
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,638
you are suited for nothing else.

813
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,265
What is your country of origin?

814
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,975
When did the flood waters recede?

815
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,101
- How did you...
- Wait a minute.

816
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,603
I got a few questions for you, too.

817
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:20,646
So let's do this, okay?
You ask one, then I'll ask one,

818
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,232
then you, then me, then...
Well, you get it.

819
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:26,193
Very well. What is your first question?

820
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,654
Well, okay, how did you get here?

821
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:31,157
Well, I mean, not you, personally,
but your culture.

822
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,826
I mean, how did all of this
end up down here?

823
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:37,079
It is said that
the gods became jealous of Atlantis.

824
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:40,249
They sent a great cataclysm
and banished us here.

825
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:43,002
All I can remember is the sky going dark

826
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:46,172
and people shouting and running.

827
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:50,217
Then, a bright light, like a star

828
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,761
floating above the city.

829
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,972
My father said it called my mother to it.

830
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:57,183
I never saw her again.

831
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:59,685
I'm sorry. If it's any consolation,

832
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,729
I know how you feel, because I lost my...

833
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:04,357
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!
Back up!

834
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:05,983
What are you telling me?

835
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,902
That you remember
because you were there?

836
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,347
No, that's... That's impossible...

837
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,280
Because, I mean,
that would make you...

838
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:15,076
You know, 8,500-8,800 years old.

839
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,202
Yes.

840
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:20,873
Oh, well. Hey. Looking good.

841
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,167
Just...

842
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,002
- You got another question for me?
- Yes.

843
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:27,713
How is it you found
your way to this place?

844
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,196
Well, I'll tell you, it wasn't easy.

845
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,457
If it weren't for this book,
we never would have made it.

846
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:35,491
Okay, second question. Legend has it
that your people possessed

847
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,556
a power source of some kind
that enabled them...

848
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,476
- You mean you can understand this?
- Yes, I'm a linguist.

849
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,686
That's what I do, that's my job.

850
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:44,271
- Now, getting back to my question...
- This, right here,

851
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:45,439
you can read this?

852
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:48,067
Yes, yes.
I can read Atlantean, just like you.

853
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:52,238
You can't, can you?

854
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,406
No one can.

855
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,865
Such knowledge has been lost to us

856
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,450
since the time of the mehbehlmoak.

857
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,202
Oh, the Great Flood.

858
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,913
- Show me.
- Okay...

859
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:06,544
"Follow the narrow passage
for another league."

860
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:09,088
"There, you will find the fifth marker."

861
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:11,632
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.
How was my accent?

862
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,342
Boorish, provincial...

863
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:16,512
- And you speak it through your nose.
- Yeah, gotta work on that.

864
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:18,556
Here, let me show you something.

865
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:25,563
What? It looks like some sort of vehicle.

866
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:29,442
Yes. But no matter what I try,
it will not respond.

867
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,068
- Perhaps if...
- Way ahead of you.

868
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,987
Okay, let's see what we got here.

869
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:36,532
Okay. "Place crystal into slot."

870
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:37,825
Yes, yes, I have done that!

871
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:40,494
"Gently place your hand
on the inscription pad."

872
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:41,954
- Yes!
- Okay, did you turn the crystal

873
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,748
- one-quarter turn back?
- Yes. Yes!

874
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,083
While your hand was
on the inscription pad?

875
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:47,209
No.

876
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:50,379
Well. See, there's
your problem right there.

877
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,214
That's an easy thing to miss.
You know, you deserve credit

878
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,175
for even getting this far.

879
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:56,844
Okay, give it a try.

880
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:07,563
Yeah, you got that right.

881
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:10,858
This is great! With this thing,

882
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:13,152
I could see the whole city
in no time at all.

883
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:14,528
Wonder how fast it goes.

884
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:25,664
So, who's hungry?

885
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,502
By the way, we were never
properly introduced.

886
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:30,920
My name's Milo.

887
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:33,005
My name is Kidagakash.

888
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,174
Kidamaschnaga.

889
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:37,343
Hey, you got a nickname?

890
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,053
Kida.

891
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:42,348
Okay, Kida. I can remember that.

892
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:06,831
What is wrong?

893
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:10,334
Oh, it's nothing. I just...
Got something in my eye.

894
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,597
You know, my grandpa
used to tell me stories

895
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,131
about this place
as far back as I can remember.

896
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:18,217
I just wish he could be
standing here with me.

897
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,279
Tell me more about your companions.

898
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:40,698
Your physician, he is called Cookie?

899
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,949
- No, that's Sweet.
- What is?

900
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:43,242
The doctor. He's Sweet.

901
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,660
Oh, he is kindly.

902
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,515
No, no, no, that's... That's his name.

903
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,372
- His name is Kindly?
- No, Sweet.

904
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,082
Well, I mean, he's kindly, too.

905
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:53,794
So all of your doctors
are sweet and kindly?

906
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:56,422
No. Well, I'm sure some are.

907
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:58,799
Ours is, but that's not a requirement.

908
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:01,135
- You're missing the point.
- You are confusing me.

909
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:04,263
Look at all those tattoos.

910
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,931
Shoot. That ain't nothing.

911
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,141
Look here what I got.

912
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:09,810
All 38 United States.

913
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,854
Watch me make Rhode Island dance.

914
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:13,772
Go on, baby, dance. Dance.

915
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,858
There you go.

916
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:31,290
Cookies are sweet, but yours is not.

917
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,959
Sweet is kindly,
but that is not his name.

918
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:38,130
Audrey is sweet,
but she is not your doctor.

919
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:41,926
And the little digging animal
called Mole...

920
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,427
He is your pet?

921
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:44,553
Close enough.

922
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:49,099
Oh, don't forget to eat the head.

923
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:50,542
That's where all the nutrients are.

924
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:12,957
You know, Kida,
the most we ever hoped to find

925
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:15,668
was some crumbling buildings,
maybe some broken pottery.

926
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:19,672
Instead, we find a living,
thriving society.

927
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,757
These guys are kinda cute

928
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:24,843
when they're not, you know,
formed into a fiery column of death.

929
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:26,845
We are not thriving.

930
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:30,182
True, our people live,
but our culture is dying.

931
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,644
We are like a stone
the ocean beats against.

932
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:36,689
With each passing year,
a little more of us is worn away.

933
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,066
I wish there was something I could do.

934
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,486
I have brought you to this place
to ask you for your help.

935
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:46,657
There is a mural here
with writing all around the pictures.

936
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,867
Yeah, well, you came to the right guy.

937
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:51,620
Okay, let me see.
Let's start with this column right here.

938
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:55,624
Well, this... Kida?

939
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:01,547
- What are you doing?
- You do swim, do you not?

940
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,048
Oh, I swim, pretty girl.

941
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,383
Pretty good! Pretty good.

942
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:07,052
Good, swim good.
Pretty good. I swim pretty good.

943
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,556
Good. It is a fair distance
to where we are going.

944
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:13,559
Hey, you are talking
to the belly flop champ

945
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:15,477
at Camp Runamuck.

946
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:19,231
Come on, we're wasting time.

947
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:25,446
Why don't you lead the way, because

948
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,323
I have no idea where we're going.

949
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:49,511
- Are you all right?
- Well, I didn't drown, so...

950
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:50,929
Good. Follow me.

951
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:07,946
This is amazing!

952
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,615
A complete history of Atlantis!

953
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,450
It's just like Plato described it.

954
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:14,620
Well, he was off on a few details, but...

955
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:15,996
The light I saw.

956
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:18,123
The star in the middle of the city.

957
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,292
What does the writing say about that?

958
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,668
I don't know yet.

959
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,629
But we're gonna find out.

960
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:24,797
Come on.

961
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,754
- The heart of Atlantis!
- What?

962
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,966
It's the heart of Atlantis! That's
what the shepherd was talking about.

963
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:11,051
It wasn't a star, it was...
It was some kind of crystal.

964
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:13,846
Like these! Don't you get it?

965
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,348
The power source I've been looking for,

966
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,016
the bright light you remember.

967
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:20,352
- They're the same thing!
- That cannot be.

968
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,438
It's what's keeping all these things...

969
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,523
You, all of Atlantis alive.

970
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:25,983
Then where is it now?

971
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:27,234
I don't know, I don't know.
You'd think something

972
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:29,528
this important
would have been in the Journal, but...

973
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:32,781
Unless... The missing page.

974
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:39,538
You have a nice swim?

975
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,543
Hey, guys, what's going on?

976
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:47,212
What's... What's with all the guns?

977
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:50,048
Guys?

978
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,719
I am such an idiot.

979
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:55,512
This is just another
treasure hunt for you.

980
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:58,348
- You're after the crystal.
- Oh, you mean this?

981
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:01,393
The heart of Atlantis.

982
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:04,938
Yeah. About that,
I would've told you sooner,

983
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:07,065
but it was strictly
on a need-to-know basis.

984
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,067
And, well, now you know.

985
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:10,944
I had to be sure you were one of us.

986
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:12,946
Welcome to the club, son.

987
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,740
I'm no mercenary.

988
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:28,754
Mercenary?

989
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:32,257
I prefer the term "adventure capitalist."

990
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,759
Besides, you're the one
who got us here.

991
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,552
You led us right to the treasure chest.

992
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,262
You don't know what
you're tampering with, Rourke.

993
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:39,848
What's to know? It's big. It's shiny.

994
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:41,350
It's going to make us all rich.

995
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:42,518
You think it's some kind of a diamond,

996
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:45,270
I thought it was some kind of a battery,
but we're both wrong.

997
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:46,980
It's their life force.

998
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:49,066
That crystal is the only thing
keeping these people alive.

999
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:50,817
You take that away, and they'll die.

1000
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:53,028
Well, that changes things.

1001
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:56,949
- Helga, what do you think?
- Knowing that, I'd double the price.

1002
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,534
I was thinking triple.

1003
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:00,953
Rourke, don't do this.

1004
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:04,414
Academics. You never want
to get your hands dirty.

1005
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,041
Think about it.

1006
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:09,336
If you gave back
every stolen artifact from a museum,

1007
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,213
you'd be left with an empty building.

1008
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:14,132
We're just providing
a necessary service

1009
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,426
to the archeological community.

1010
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:17,970
Not interested.

1011
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:20,597
I got to admit, I'm disappointed.

1012
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,267
You're an idealist,
just like your grandfather.

1013
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:26,520
Do yourself a favor, Milo.
Don't be like him.

1014
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:28,939
For once, do the smart thing.

1015
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:33,986
I really hate it
when negotiations go sour.

1016
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:39,992
Let's try this again.

1017
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:46,999
- Knock, knock.
- Room service.

1018
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:50,460
Tell them to drop their weapons... Now!

1019
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:55,507
Spread out! Search everywhere!

1020
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,302
You're not applying yourself, son.

1021
00:59:58,386 --> 00:59:59,707
There's got to be something else.

1022
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,597
Well, there isn't. It just says,

1023
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:04,349
"The heart of Atlantis lies
in the eyes of her king."

1024
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,143
Well, then maybe Old King Cole here

1025
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:08,103
can help us fill in the blanks.

1026
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:10,814
How about it, chief?
Where's the crystal chamber?

1027
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:12,733
You will destroy yourselves.

1028
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:15,027
Maybe I'm not being clear.

1029
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,241
Rourke, this was not a part of the plan.

1030
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:23,076
Plan's changed, doc.

1031
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:25,601
I'd suggest you put a bandage
on that bleeding heart of yours.

1032
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:27,873
It doesn't suit a mercenary.

1033
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:31,293
Well, as usual, diplomacy has failed us.

1034
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,128
Now, I'm going to count to 10.

1035
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:35,258
And you're going to tell me
where the crystal is.

1036
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,424
One...

1037
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:38,967
Two...

1038
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:40,719
Nine...

1039
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:42,387
T...

1040
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:52,606
The heart of Atlantis
lies in the eyes of her king.

1041
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,775
This is it. We're in.

1042
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:57,235
Rourke, for the last time,
you've got to listen to me.

1043
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,238
You don't have the slightest idea
what this power is capable of.

1044
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:02,908
True, but I can think of a few countries

1045
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:05,911
who'd pay anything to find out.

1046
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:10,332
Hurry. Get on.

1047
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:31,603
Jackpot.

1048
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:44,199
The kings of our past.

1049
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,413
Thatch, tell her to wrap it up.

1050
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:51,039
We got a schedule to meet.

1051
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,340
Kida...

1052
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,509
I'm sorry.

1053
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:16,898
Come on, let's get this over with.

1054
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:17,983
I don't like this place.

1055
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:20,068
All right, Thatch, what's next?

1056
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,154
Okay, there's a giant crystal

1057
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,947
hovering 150 feet above our heads

1058
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,490
over a bottomless pit of water.

1059
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:27,159
Doesn't anything surprise you?

1060
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:29,453
The only thing that surprises me
is you're still

1061
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,496
talking and
that thing's not on the truck yet.

1062
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:34,124
- Now move it!
- I don't know how to move it.

1063
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:36,293
I don't even know
what's holding it up there.

1064
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,178
Talk to me, Thatch. What's happening?

1065
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:49,639
Look, all it says here
is that the crystal is alive, somehow.

1066
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:51,183
I don't know how to explain it.

1067
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:53,643
It's their deity. It's their power source.

1068
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:55,395
Speak English, professor.

1069
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,189
They're a part of it. It's a part of them.

1070
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:59,191
I'm doing the best I can here.

1071
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:00,901
- Well, do better.
- Oh, I know.

1072
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:03,653
Why don't you translate,
and I'll wave the gun around?

1073
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:13,872
What did she say?

1074
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:16,333
I don't know. I didn't catch it.

1075
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:38,266
Hold your horses, lover boy.

1076
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:40,894
Kida.

1077
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,385
No, don't. Don't touch her.

1078
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:31,444
All right, step back.

1079
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:34,072
Sergeant, keep those people back.

1080
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:36,199
You heard him. Step back.

1081
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:39,035
I'm warning you.

1082
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:40,537
So...

1083
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:43,039
I guess this is how it ends?

1084
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:45,166
Fine. You win.

1085
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:47,335
You're wiping out an entire civilization,

1086
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,713
but hey... You'll be rich.

1087
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:51,423
Congratulations, Audrey.

1088
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:52,966
Guess you and your dad will be able

1089
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:55,343
to open up that second garage after all.

1090
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:58,555
And, Vinny, you can start
a whole chain of flower shops.

1091
01:06:58,597 --> 01:07:00,640
I'm sure your family's
going to be very proud.

1092
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:03,018
But that's what it's all about, right?

1093
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:06,980
- Money.
- Get off your soapbox, Thatch.

1094
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:09,649
You've read Darwin.
It's called natural selection.

1095
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:11,443
We're just helping it along.

1096
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:14,070
- Commander, we're ready.
- Yeah, give me a minute.

1097
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,739
I know I'm forgetting something.

1098
01:07:15,781 --> 01:07:18,742
I got the cargo, the crystal, the crew...

1099
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:20,660
Oh, yeah.

1100
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:25,123
Look at it this way, son.

1101
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:27,459
You were the man
who discovered Atlantis,

1102
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:29,836
and now, you're part of the exhibit.

1103
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:40,305
Let's move, people.

1104
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:43,892
That was an order,
not a suggestion. Let's go!

1105
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:25,517
We're all going to die.

1106
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,773
Oh, you can't be serious.

1107
01:08:31,857 --> 01:08:33,233
This is wrong, and you know it.

1108
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:35,568
We're this close
to our biggest payday ever,

1109
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:38,113
and you pick now of all times
to grow a conscience.

1110
01:08:38,572 --> 01:08:40,281
We've done a lot of things
we're not proud of,

1111
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:43,535
robbing graves, plundering tombs,

1112
01:08:43,577 --> 01:08:46,913
double parking, but nobody got hurt.

1113
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:50,875
Well, maybe somebody got hurt,
but nobody we knew.

1114
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:53,461
Well, if that's the way you want it, fine.

1115
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:54,963
More for me.

1116
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:58,716
P.T. Barnum was right.

1117
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:20,196
- We can't let him do this!
- Wait a second.

1118
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:37,088
Okay, now you can go.

1119
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,465
Milo, you better get up here.

1120
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:44,554
How's he doing?

1121
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,723
Not good, I'm afraid.

1122
01:09:46,765 --> 01:09:48,183
Internal bleeding.

1123
01:09:48,475 --> 01:09:50,018
There's nothing more I can do.

1124
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:51,269
What a nightmare.

1125
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:54,939
- And I brought it here.
- Don't go beating yourself up.

1126
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:56,733
He's been after that crystal
since Iceland.

1127
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:00,612
The crystal. Sweet, that's it.

1128
01:10:00,654 --> 01:10:04,073
These... These crystals,
they have some sort of healing energy.

1129
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:06,075
I've seen it work.

1130
01:10:06,118 --> 01:10:07,202
No.

1131
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,287
Where is my daughter?

1132
01:10:09,496 --> 01:10:11,331
Well, she...

1133
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:15,627
She has been chosen,
like her mother before her.

1134
01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:17,378
What?

1135
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:18,963
In times of danger,

1136
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:21,299
the crystal will choose a host,

1137
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:24,510
one of royal blood, to protect itself

1138
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:25,845
and its people.

1139
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:27,847
It will accept no other.

1140
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:30,099
Wait a minute. Choose?

1141
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:32,227
So this thing is alive?

1142
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:33,645
In a way.

1143
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:36,189
The crystal thrives

1144
01:10:36,273 --> 01:10:40,151
on the collective emotions
of all who came before us.

1145
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:44,280
In return, it provides power,

1146
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:47,158
longevity, protection.

1147
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:48,868
As it grew,

1148
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:51,996
it developed
a consciousness of its own.

1149
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:55,917
In my arrogance,

1150
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:59,170
I sought to use it as a weapon of war,

1151
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:03,174
but it's power proved
too great to control.

1152
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:08,137
It overwhelmed us
and led to our destruction.

1153
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:11,015
That's why you hid it beneath the city.

1154
01:11:11,058 --> 01:11:12,850
To keep history from repeating itself.

1155
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:18,523
And to prevent Kida from suffering
the same fate as my beloved wife.

1156
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:21,693
What do you mean?
What's going to happen to Kida?

1157
01:11:21,735 --> 01:11:25,363
If she remains bonded to the crystal,

1158
01:11:25,406 --> 01:11:28,741
she could be lost to it forever.

1159
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:33,204
The love of my daughter
is all I have left.

1160
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:36,666
My burden would have become hers

1161
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:41,879
when the time was right,
but now, it falls to you.

1162
01:11:41,922 --> 01:11:43,131
Me?

1163
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:45,883
Return the crystal.

1164
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:49,262
Save Atlantis.

1165
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:51,431
Save my daughter.

1166
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:14,787
So, what's it going to be?

1167
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:20,418
- Excuse me?
- I followed you in, and I'll follow you out.

1168
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:22,920
- It's your decision.
- Oh, my decision?

1169
01:12:22,963 --> 01:12:25,715
Well, I think we've seen
how effective my decisions have been.

1170
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:26,841
Let's recap.

1171
01:12:26,925 --> 01:12:29,093
I lead a band of plundering vandals

1172
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:31,637
to the greatest archeological find
in recorded history,

1173
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:35,183
thus enabling the kidnap
and/or murder of the royal family.

1174
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:36,934
Not to mention personally delivering

1175
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:40,438
the most powerful force known to man
into the hands of a mercenary nutcase

1176
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:42,607
who's probably going
to sell it to the Kaiser!

1177
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:44,359
Have I left anything out?

1178
01:12:44,651 --> 01:12:46,012
Well, you did set the camp on fire

1179
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:48,196
- and drop us down that big hole.
- Thank you.

1180
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:50,406
Thank you very much.

1181
01:12:54,286 --> 01:12:56,788
Of course, it's been my experience
when you hit bottom,

1182
01:12:57,289 --> 01:12:58,873
the only place left to go is up.

1183
01:12:58,957 --> 01:13:01,084
Who told you that?

1184
01:13:01,126 --> 01:13:03,878
A fella by the name
of Thaddeus Thatch.

1185
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:13,888
Where are you going?

1186
01:13:14,139 --> 01:13:16,891
- I'm going after Rourke.
- Milo, that's crazy.

1187
01:13:16,975 --> 01:13:20,770
I didn't say it was the smart thing.
But it is the right thing.

1188
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:26,359
Come on. We better make sure
he doesn't hurt himself.

1189
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:30,696
Milo, what do you think you are doing?

1190
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:31,906
Just follow my lead.

1191
01:13:36,328 --> 01:13:38,496
I'm impressed.

1192
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:39,997
It's simple. All you got to do...

1193
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,332
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shut up. We get it, okay?

1194
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:42,875
No, no, wait!

1195
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:48,673
Gently. Just gently.

1196
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:51,384
Hey, Milo, you got something sporty?

1197
01:13:51,468 --> 01:13:53,052
You know, like a tuna?

1198
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:56,389
- How is this done?
- All you got to do is use the crystals.

1199
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:57,682
Kida showed me.

1200
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:02,854
Half-turn right, quarter-turn back.
Keep your hand on the pad.

1201
01:14:05,732 --> 01:14:08,025
Saddle up, partners.
Bring jerky and ammo.

1202
01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:12,321
I'm so excited.

1203
01:14:16,243 --> 01:14:17,452
All right, this is it!

1204
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:19,036
We're going to rescue the princess.

1205
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:20,746
We're going to save Atlantis.

1206
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:24,041
Or we're going to die trying.
Now let's do it!

1207
01:14:47,399 --> 01:14:49,192
I love it when I win.

1208
01:15:05,792 --> 01:15:07,210
Okay, here's the plan.

1209
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:10,171
We're going to come in low and fast
and take them by surprise.

1210
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:11,756
Well, I've got news for you, Milo.

1211
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,550
Rourke is never surprised,
and he's got a lot of guns.

1212
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:16,511
Great. Well, do you have
any suggestions?

1213
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:18,638
Yeah. Don't get shot.

1214
01:15:26,438 --> 01:15:27,688
There they are!

1215
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:29,065
We've got company!

1216
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:33,778
Take off!

1217
01:15:41,745 --> 01:15:42,828
Take her up!

1218
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:52,046
Holy smokes!

1219
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:54,257
You told me he only had guns.

1220
01:15:54,299 --> 01:15:56,259
What I said was, he's never surprised.

1221
01:16:07,312 --> 01:16:09,564
Okay, now things are getting good.

1222
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:10,982
Vinny! Heads up!

1223
01:16:11,024 --> 01:16:13,317
We can't let them reach
the top of that shaft!

1224
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:33,212
Vinny, new plan.
You and me, we're going to be decoys.

1225
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:36,591
Audrey, Sweet, fly up underneath
that thing and cut her loose.

1226
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:37,842
We're on it.

1227
01:16:41,638 --> 01:16:42,847
Lieutenant!

1228
01:16:51,356 --> 01:16:53,983
I thought you said this thing could
cut through a femur in 28 seconds!

1229
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:55,318
Less talk, more saw.

1230
01:17:06,830 --> 01:17:09,874
Looks like somebody's
working overtime.

1231
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:14,420
Come on, girl. Time's up.

1232
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:19,133
All right, Milo, this is it.
Any last words?

1233
01:17:20,177 --> 01:17:22,637
Yeah. I really wish I had
a better idea than this!

1234
01:17:27,517 --> 01:17:28,851
We're losing altitude.

1235
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:30,019
Lighten the load.

1236
01:17:31,563 --> 01:17:33,648
That's it,
unless someone wants to jump.

1237
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:35,316
Ladies first.

1238
01:17:40,447 --> 01:17:42,365
You said we were in this together!

1239
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:45,076
You promised me a percentage!

1240
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:47,995
Next time, get it in writing.

1241
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:51,582
Nothing personal.

1242
01:18:01,718 --> 01:18:04,595
Well, I have to hand it to you.
You're a bigger pain in the neck

1243
01:18:04,638 --> 01:18:06,806
than I would have
ever thought possible.

1244
01:18:08,975 --> 01:18:11,519
I consider myself
an even-tempered man.

1245
01:18:11,603 --> 01:18:13,604
It takes a lot to get under my skin.

1246
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:17,650
But congratulations,
you just won the solid-gold kewpie doll.

1247
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:30,246
Nothing personal.

1248
01:18:40,298 --> 01:18:41,966
Tired, Mr. Thatch?

1249
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:45,636
That's a darn shame

1250
01:18:46,513 --> 01:18:49,473
because I'm just getting warmed up.

1251
01:19:10,328 --> 01:19:11,746
Thank heaven.

1252
01:19:28,346 --> 01:19:29,680
Oh, great!

1253
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:46,530
The volcano... She awakes!

1254
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:48,574
Hey, I had nothing to do with it.

1255
01:19:48,658 --> 01:19:50,451
This here would be
a good place not to be.

1256
01:19:50,535 --> 01:19:53,037
No, wait. We got to get her back
or the whole city will die.

1257
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:54,955
And if we don't get out of here, we'll die.

1258
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,540
It's the only way to reverse this.

1259
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,209
Just do it!

1260
01:20:09,179 --> 01:20:10,554
Milo, no!

1261
01:20:17,187 --> 01:20:18,229
Go!

1262
01:20:53,306 --> 01:20:57,393
The fissure,
it is about to eject its pyroclastic fury!

1263
01:20:57,435 --> 01:20:59,603
Milo, Mole says the wall's going to blow!

1264
01:24:21,848 --> 01:24:23,057
Milo?

1265
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:15,109
Atlantis will honor your names forever.

1266
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:17,528
I only wish there was more
we could do for you.

1267
01:25:17,737 --> 01:25:21,490
You know, thanks anyway,
but I think we're good.

1268
01:25:23,034 --> 01:25:24,827
They'll take you as far as the surface.

1269
01:25:24,869 --> 01:25:26,703
We are really going to miss you, Milo.

1270
01:25:26,746 --> 01:25:29,206
You know, I'm going
to reopen the flower shop,

1271
01:25:29,249 --> 01:25:32,417
and I'm going to think of
you guys every single day,

1272
01:25:32,502 --> 01:25:35,379
Monday through Friday, 9:00 to 5:00,

1273
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:36,755
Saturday until 2:00.

1274
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:40,217
Sunday... I'm going to take Sunday off,
probably, and...

1275
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:42,052
Maybe I'll go in for
a couple of hours, you know.

1276
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:44,596
But August... I'm going to take August.

1277
01:25:44,889 --> 01:25:47,599
I ain't so good at speechifying,

1278
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:49,810
but I wanted you to have this.

1279
01:25:49,894 --> 01:25:52,020
It's the bacon grease
from the whole trip.

1280
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:53,730
Cookie, I...

1281
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:00,737
Two for flinching.

1282
01:26:01,614 --> 01:26:02,656
See you, Milo.

1283
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:05,284
Hey, Milo!

1284
01:26:05,368 --> 01:26:07,536
Mole.

1285
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:10,747
Mole. Hey, well...

1286
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:11,999
Good-bye, Mole.

1287
01:26:12,208 --> 01:26:13,667
Now, you sure you want to stay?

1288
01:26:13,751 --> 01:26:16,472
There's a hero's welcome waiting for
the man who discovered Atlantis.

1289
01:26:16,546 --> 01:26:19,006
I don't think
the world needs another hero.

1290
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:22,551
Besides, I hear there's an opening
down here for an expert in gibberish.

1291
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:25,053
You take good care of
yourself, Milo Thatch.

1292
01:26:25,096 --> 01:26:27,556
Yeah. You, too, Sweet.

1293
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:28,640
Come here.

1294
01:26:30,768 --> 01:26:33,437
Sweet, before you go, could you...

1295
01:26:33,479 --> 01:26:34,521
No problem.

1296
01:26:34,606 --> 01:26:36,023
Thanks.

1297
01:26:36,107 --> 01:26:38,275
Oh, you're getting a bill.

1298
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:39,860
Can we go home now?

1299
01:26:39,986 --> 01:26:43,155
Come on, y'all. Let's get
one last shot in front of the fish.

1300
01:26:44,574 --> 01:26:46,950
- Say gochk!
- Gochk!

1301
01:26:53,082 --> 01:26:56,335
Now, let's go over it again,
just so we got it straight.

1302
01:26:56,878 --> 01:27:00,214
- You didn't find anything?
- Nope. Just a lot of rocks...

1303
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:02,257
And fish, little fish.

1304
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:04,259
Sponges.

1305
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:05,677
What happened to Helga?

1306
01:27:05,762 --> 01:27:08,680
Well, we lost her when
a flaming zeppelin come down on her.

1307
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:11,850
- Missing.
- That's right. And Rourke?

1308
01:27:11,935 --> 01:27:14,686
Nervous breakdown.
You could say he went all to pieces.

1309
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:17,648
In fact, you could say
he was transamorgafied

1310
01:27:17,732 --> 01:27:19,483
and then busted into a zillion...

1311
01:27:19,525 --> 01:27:21,652
He's missing, too.

1312
01:27:21,694 --> 01:27:23,820
- What about Milo?
- Went down with the sub.

1313
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:31,328
Lord, give me strength.

1314
01:27:31,955 --> 01:27:33,705
I'm going to miss that boy.

1315
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:36,667
At least he's in a better place now.

1316
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:46,969
Dear Mr. Whitmore,

1317
01:27:47,011 --> 01:27:49,096
I hope this piece of proof
is enough for you.

1318
01:27:50,139 --> 01:27:54,101
It sure convinced me.
Thanks from both of us.

1319
01:29:44,128 --> 01:29:47,464
They'll try to hold you back

1320
01:29:49,634 --> 01:29:53,845
And they will say
you're wrong

1321
01:29:55,598 --> 01:29:59,101
But they will
never understand

1322
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:02,979
The journey that you're on

1323
01:30:06,567 --> 01:30:10,362
They'll try
to change your mind

1324
01:30:12,323 --> 01:30:15,158
They'll try to change
your heart

1325
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:16,827
Oh, yeah

1326
01:30:17,912 --> 01:30:21,665
But they will
never understand

1327
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:24,376
Who you are

1328
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:27,838
And you'll still believe

1329
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:30,048
Still believe

1330
01:30:30,133 --> 01:30:32,968
And you know
And you know

1331
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:35,679
You must go
You must go

1332
01:30:35,763 --> 01:30:39,474
Where the dream takes you

1333
01:30:39,517 --> 01:30:41,351
Where you can
take your heart

1334
01:30:41,394 --> 01:30:44,813
Where your heart longs to be

1335
01:30:44,856 --> 01:30:47,190
Your dream will lead you on

1336
01:30:48,776 --> 01:30:52,446
When you finally
find that place

1337
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:56,491
You'll find all you need

1338
01:30:58,202 --> 01:31:06,084
Where the dream takes you

1339
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:08,837
Oh, yeah

1340
01:31:10,631 --> 01:31:13,758
There's something
in your soul

1341
01:31:13,843 --> 01:31:16,553
Something in your soul

1342
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:20,348
That won't be denied

1343
01:31:22,226 --> 01:31:25,729
It's the faith to dream
that keeps

1344
01:31:25,771 --> 01:31:28,523
The dream alive

1345
01:31:28,566 --> 01:31:31,902
So you'll still believe

1346
01:31:31,986 --> 01:31:34,279
Still believe

1347
01:31:34,363 --> 01:31:37,157
And you know

1348
01:31:37,241 --> 01:31:39,326
You must go

1349
01:31:39,410 --> 01:31:43,580
Where the dream takes you

1350
01:31:43,664 --> 01:31:45,707
Where your dream
takes your heart

1351
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:49,085
Where your heart
longs to be

1352
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:51,505
Your dream will lead you on

1353
01:31:52,924 --> 01:31:56,760
When you finally
find that place

1354
01:31:56,802 --> 01:32:00,889
You'll find all you need

1355
01:32:02,391 --> 01:32:05,769
Where the dream takes you

1356
01:32:05,853 --> 01:32:10,023
Go where your heart
is meant to be

1357
01:32:10,775 --> 01:32:13,276
And you may find

1358
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:16,112
Somebody there

1359
01:32:16,197 --> 01:32:21,159
Someone to share your dream

1360
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:31,211
All right, all right
Your dream will lead you on

1361
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:35,799
When you finally
find that place

1362
01:32:35,841 --> 01:32:40,303
You'll find all you need

1363
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:45,183
Where the dream leads you

1364
01:32:45,268 --> 01:32:47,185
Your dream will lead you on

1365
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:50,772
Far as your heart can see

1366
01:32:50,815 --> 01:32:52,649
Your dream will lead you on

1367
01:32:52,733 --> 01:32:54,484
Oh, yes

1368
01:32:54,527 --> 01:32:57,988
There's a world
that waits for you

1369
01:32:58,030 --> 01:33:00,740
You're not alone

1370
01:33:00,825 --> 01:33:03,994
You'll find your home

1371
01:33:04,036 --> 01:33:05,829
Where the dream takes you

1372
01:33:05,871 --> 01:33:07,914
Try to change your mind

1373
01:33:09,542 --> 01:33:11,334
Where the dream takes you

1374
01:33:11,377 --> 01:33:13,378
Try to change your heart

1375
01:33:15,172 --> 01:33:17,340
Where the dream takes you

1376
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:20,051
But you must go
