345
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,355
Bouncer: Jay who?

346
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:59,324
Daisy: Jay.
He snuck us in the back.

347
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:01,960
He said that he didn't want
the bouncer to see us.

348
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:04,195
Bouncer:
Yo, you got to get down.

349
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:05,596
Come on.

350
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,665
Daisy: What? No, no.
No, no, no, no.

351
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:10,635
No, no, no, no, no! No! No, no,
no, no, no, no! Stop!

352
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,371
Jay: Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey!

353
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:15,340
Bouncer:
Yo, you need to leave now!

354
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:17,008
Jay: Okay, take it easy.
We're going.

355
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,410
You all right?

356
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:22,513
Okay. We're going.
We're going.

357
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:24,015
Come on.

358
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:26,284
You all right?
Okay.

359
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:30,755
Daisy: This fat man
offered me $100 for a hand job.

360
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,757
I've never had a job.

361
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:36,227
Jay: You sure you have
no one you can call?

362
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,298
You have no friends?
You have no family?

363
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,666
You have nobody?

364
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:48,539
What am I supposed to do
with you?

365
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,560
Do you have I.D.?

366
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,496
You got to show I.D.
At security.

367
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,735
Daisy:
I have it. It's in here.

368
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,504
Jay: What's happening?
Wh-what's wrong?

369
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:22,540
Daisy: Um, I, uh... Um...

370
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,475
I-I don't --
I-I don't know what to do.

371
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:26,310
Jay: That's okay. I have a plan,
and it's a good one.

372
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:28,079
All you have to do is smile
and eat yummy snacks.

373
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:30,548
And when people say,
"hey, what do you do?"

374
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,417
You say, "I'm a nurse."

375
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:34,118
Daisy:
I'm not supposed to lie.

376
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,254
Jay: It's not a lie.

377
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:37,488
Not a lie.

378
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,424
It's pretending, which is fine.

379
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:40,725
Daisy:
What's the difference?

380
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,761
Jay:
I'll explain it to you later.

381
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:46,330
- Daisy: Okay.
- Jay: Okay?

382
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:54,272
Daisy: Your dancer friends
really don't mind

383
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:55,640
I borrowed their clothes?

384
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:57,708
Jay: No, no.
They wanted to help.

385
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,846
Daisy: Are you sure
this looks okay?

386
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:03,748
Jay: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You look fantastic.

387
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,349
Really, you look great.

388
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:06,851
Just, uh, uh,
keep the sweater on.

389
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,386
- Daisy: This?
- Jay: Yeah.

390
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:09,587
Daisy: Whoa!

391
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,122
Jay: Oh. You okay?

392
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:13,724
- Daisy: Yeah.
- Jay: Okay.

393
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,397
[Snoring]

394
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,265
Flight attendant:
I'm sorry. Hi.

395
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,800
Jay: Hi.

396
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:24,535
Flight attendant: Your friend's
been in the bathroom

397
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:25,736
for a really long time.

398
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,772
Jay: Okay, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

399
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,507
[Knock on door]

400
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:32,143
Daisy, it's me.
It's Jay.

401
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:34,412
Daisy: There's no flusher.

402
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:37,348
Jay:
She's a first-time flyer.

403
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,683
Yeah, there is, honey.

404
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:40,318
It's just a little different
than usual.

405
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,752
You see the button in the wall
above the seat?

406
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:43,888
Flight attendant:
It's actually a lever.

407
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,456
Jay: Yeah, push that.

408
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,525
Flight attendant:
It says "flush" right on it.

409
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:49,494
Daisy: But the letters
are worn off.

410
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:51,829
Jay: Anyway, just push it.

411
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,397
[Toilet flushes loudly]

412
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,466
Daisy: Aaah!

413
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,836
[Passengers murmur]

414
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,705
It was really loud.

415
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:03,841
Jay: You handled it well,
though.

416
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:06,878
Okay, let's try
and get some sleep, okay?

417
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,579
Daisy: I'm not sleepy.

418
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:10,715
Jay:
Then eat your peanuts.

419
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:12,350
Daisy: I already did.

420
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:14,585
Jay: [Sighs]
Then eat mine.

421
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:18,923
Daisy: I already did.

422
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:20,925
Jay: Hey,
this flight's called a red eye.

423
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:22,527
Do you know why?

424
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:24,262
Because if we don't get sleep,

425
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:27,231
we're gonna have red eyes
when we get to new Orleans.

426
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:30,468
And you don't want red eyes
when you meet my family, do you?

427
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,869
Daisy: No.

428
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:33,304
Jay: No.

429
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:35,373
So, let's be quiet.

430
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,543
Okay.

431
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:41,279

434
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,494
- Jay: Hi.
- Flight attendant: Hi.

435
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:58,396
We have another problem.

436
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,469
Jay: Let's go, hon.
You can't sit here.

437
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,405
Daisy: But the seats
are too small back there.

438
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,440
Jay: I know, but we didn't pay
for the big seats.

439
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:10,675
Daisy:
Can we pay for them now?

440
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:11,876
Jay:
No, we can't pay for them now.

441

What's wrong with her?

442
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,246
Jay: Excuse me. There's nothing
wrong with my girlfriend.

443
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:16,647
Thank you.

444
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,583
Let's go, hon. I'm lonely
back there. Come on.

445
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:19,784
Daisy:
Do we have to sleep?

446
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:21,652
Jay:
No, we don't have to sleep.

447
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,654
Daisy: Can we get some of those
good nuts in the nice dish?

448
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,323
Man: Um, take mine.

449
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:28,459

[Indistinct conversations]

451
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,506
Everyone's moving around.

452
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,675
Jay: [Clears throat]

453
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:47,278
Yeah, we're getting ready
to land.

454
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:53,017
Daisy: Before...

455
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:57,822
You called me your girlfriend.

456
00:20:57,824 --> 00:21:00,424
Am I really your girlfriend?

457
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,695
Jay: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're my girlfriend.

[Sighs deeply]

459
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:15,573
Daisy: My mother told me I would
never be anybody's girlfriend.

460
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:22,780
Jay: Well,
I guess she was wrong, then.

461
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,716
[Sighs]

462
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,951

stay out here.

Jay: You'll be okay.

465
00:22:08,628 --> 00:22:11,429
You'll be okay.
Come on.

466
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,968
Woman: So, let's move consuela
to the family table

467
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,671
because the wedding party
will be somewhere else.

468
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,907

we traveled light.

Woman: Well, I can always
pick you up a suit.

486
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:59,043
And remember, this is the South,
so you'll have two rooms.

487
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:02,380
Daisy: I wouldn't stay
in the same room with a man.

488

we aren't...

Jason: We haven't heard from you
in a long time.

she's very beautiful.

on four wheels.

513
00:25:13,246 --> 00:25:15,179
It's even got a China cabinet.

in the whole country.

517
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,754
And I practically stole it.

518
