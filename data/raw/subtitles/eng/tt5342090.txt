1
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,636
Richard John Wincott.

2
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:14,273
Case number Delta 6920.

3
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:18,578
It's Richie.

4
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:24,349
Where'd you go last night?

5
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:28,154
Just out.

6
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:32,658
I just saw some friends.

7
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,692
Lauren?

8
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:35,561
No.

9
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:38,163
Just some other friends.

10
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,666
You're eighteen now.

11
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:47,206
You said no to staying with us
here at the children's home.

12
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,609
You know what that means?

13
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,315
You need to seek a job
as soon as you can.

14
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,321
Come on Jakob.
Catch the ball!

15
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:09,462
Let's talk school.

16
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,430
Why not get the GED?

17
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,813
I don't want
to go to school.

18
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:16,468
I want to be on my
own... start working,

19
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,471
and I think the GED's just
going to slow things down.

20
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:21,206
Where you want to go?

21
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:25,444
Would you rather go
to the library or to a party?

22
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:28,480
Uh, probably a party.

23
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,183
Parties are more fun, huh?

24
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,485
Yeah.

25
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:35,187
And do you like to read?

26
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,289
Um.

27
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,258
I don't know. Sometimes.

28
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,708
I don't remember much of it, but I do
remember we were staying in a hotel room.

29
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,979
And there was a woman in a car
who had taken me and my brother,

30
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:37,616
and I remember us leaving.
And it was dark outside.

31
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:38,951
I don't know how late it was.

32
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:43,288
I remember crying, and my mom just kept saying,
"It's okay. It's only for a little while."

33
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,525
And that was the last
time I lived with them.

34
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:54,294
Fifteen years of not speaking to your adopted
dad, and the first word that you say is "Hey."

35
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:57,936
And he says, "What's up
son? How you been?"

36
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:03,408
And that's when CPS came to the
apartment that we were staying in.

37
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:08,013
And that day... that same day,
my mom had a miscarriage.

38
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,650
I, uh, I washed my
clothes in the creek.

39
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:14,586
Um, it was right beside
a railroad track.

40
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:18,457
Um, cooked my own
food out there.

41
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,958
I was sitting right
behind her, too.

42
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,395
She was leaning out the car.

43
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:27,036
And I thought she was actually... I was actually
about to see my mom go all over the highway.

44
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:31,503
She was on a lot of drugs,
and that she drank regularly.

45
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:35,274
And I remember them drinking all the time;
they always had a drink in their hands.

46
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:38,377
I didn't know about the drugs until I
was older and someone else told me.

47
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,679
And I didn't... it makes
more sense now.

48
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:45,651
But I don't think there was really a lot
of reasons for the stuff that happened.

49
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,291
God is good.

50
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:52,975
All the time.

51
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:54,292
- All the time.
- God is good.

52
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:55,961
I'm glad
y'all say that with me.

53
00:04:55,963 --> 00:05:00,565
Now look. Everybody in this room
has a goal, a success story.

54
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,567
I grew up through CPS.

55
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,937
Eleven years.

56
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:07,306
Throughout that time I've been through foster
home to foster home, group home to group home.

57
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:09,941
What I want to tell you all today is,
and I'm going to make it all real short

58
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,677
and sweet and simple.

59
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,412
And I'm going to beat
it out like Tarzan.

60
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:16,315
What I'm doing though is
I'm trying to inspire y'all

61
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:18,083
to become the greatest
that y'all can be.

62
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,018
To not become a statistic.

63
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,721
The question is, who are you?

64
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:24,589
What do you want for yourself?

65
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,458
Accomplish that. Fight it.

66
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,427
That's the best thing I
know how to do is fight.

67
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:31,730
I plan. I plot.

68
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:36,501
I know how aging out goes.
I talked to Javon about it.

69
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,103
He's doing fine now.

70
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:39,771
You know
what we call it?

71
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:41,473
- Call what?
- Aging out.

72
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:42,941
What?

73
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,409
Emancipating.

74
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:51,616
College is not for
everybody, but education is.

75
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:55,487
Education is a lot like
American Express.

76
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:57,723
You don't want to even think
about leaving home without it.

77
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:59,691
Education is a lot like Tide.

78
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:03,795
It gets out the stains that
all the others leave behind.

79
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:07,599
And we can go ahead
and say what fear really is.

80
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:11,603
It's "False Expectations
Appearing Real."

81
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,807
You know my story. As
your instructor, I told you.

82
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,110
What's really, really important,

83
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,679
as you go out in this world,

84
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:26,618
at the age of eighteen, are the
last four letters in American.

85
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,053
"I can."

86
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:19,698
<i>And the
arresting officer this morning</i>

87
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,166
<i>that was intimidating the man
under arrest because voices...</i>

88
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,735
I called about leasing.

89
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:27,306
Um, last name's Wincott.

90
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,627
I need a first month's
rent and a security deposit.

91
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:40,553
Oh.

92
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:46,224
Uh, you're twenty-five short.

93
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:49,761
It's four-fifty.

94
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:51,963
It's four-seventy-five
with background check.

95
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:56,801
I don't... I'll have
to come back.

96
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,604
Hey! I'll add it to next month.

97
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:03,942
How much does that
make next month?

98
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,150
All right. They pick up
the trash on Wednesday.

99
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,920
Use the green bin
close to the back door.

100
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:19,224
And you're going to have to jiggle
the mailbox key, but it'll work.

101
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,162
So.

102
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,730
You need any help moving in?

103
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:26,765
Oh no. I got it.

104
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:28,600
All right. Here you go.

105
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:32,771
Thanks.

106
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,803
Jessica. Hey, it's Richie.

107
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,107
Yeah. Richie.

108
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:09,908
Yeah, from the old house.

109
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,313
Yeah, I know. It's been a while.

110
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:20,251
How are you?

111
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,389
Are you busy?

112
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:32,297
Oh, yeah. I...

113
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,800
Great.

114
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,902
I had no idea.

115
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:43,408
So, when did you get engaged?

116
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,483
<i>We've
done some great things.</i>

117
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,284
<i>We've had some really great games.
Especially, Sam Houston State.</i>

118
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,753
<i>I thought we played
really well.</i>

119
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:55,920
You've got a license?

120
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:56,888
Yeah.

121
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:57,890
Any arrests?

122
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:59,791
Nope. Nothing serious.

123
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:02,260
No.

124
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:03,762
Well, we'll find out.

125
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,263
How's your physical?

126
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,150
Clean.

127
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:09,234
We need fitters,
lifters, painters.

128
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:11,169
- All of it.
- Yeah. I can do it all.

129
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:22,147
How much construction
experience you got?

130
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:23,148
Not much.

131
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,450
Watch out for
these operators.

132
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:27,252
Look for their blind spot.

133
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:29,320
They can't see you when
you walk up behind them.

134
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:33,024
I need to get a bunch of the road
stilts set before the weekend.

135
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:30,749
Hernandez.

136
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:33,384
Wincott.

137
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,454
Ten dollars was taken
out for lost PPE.

138
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,890
You want to make it up,
you work nights.

139
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,225
- Bellagio.
- Nights?

140
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:41,993
We're short a body.

141
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:44,229
Botts.

142
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:45,296
I'll do it.

143
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:48,032
Be back at six. You'll
get a new work order.

144
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,280
Door was
one-twenty-seven.

145
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,482
I thought we agreed
on ninety-five.

146
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:39,517
It's the cheapest I could find.

147
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:14,085
Stay safe.

148
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:40,578
I'm Swim.

149
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:42,146
Richie.

150
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,420
All right, Richie.

151
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:54,092
What was the damage to
the land lady adventure?

152
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:55,627
What's that mean?

153
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:57,962
Uh.

154
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:59,364
How'd you make out?

155
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,269
Did she gouge you?

156
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:07,171
Did she rent you a place
with a corpse in the closet?

157
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,108
She was okay.

158
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,079
Well, that's good to hear.

159
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:20,585
She'd sell her own
daughter if she could.

160
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:24,355
And for twice as
what she's worth.

161
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:29,394
You got ripped off?

162
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:36,367
She rips off everybody.

163
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:45,243
People ain't got much brains
here. You understand?

164
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:50,381
There's nowhere else to go.
You see? And she knows that.

165
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:56,421
But one wrong could be wiped
out next to a hundred wrongs.

166
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,056
Justice.

167
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,696
Ninety-three dollars.

168
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,501
He bends down to catch the
ball but he can't stop himself.

169
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:13,071
So, he passes the ball over
here, and then he throws it.

170
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:14,605
Much better than that.

171
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:20,311
Yeah. Just like
that. Just like that.

172
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,083
What's that?

173
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:26,785
At least I throw
better than you.

174
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:28,666
I never claimed to play ball
that way. You know?

175
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:36,728
- You got a light?
- I do.

176
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:40,365
There you go.

177
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,713
- You like them?
- I do.

178
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:58,016
- You do?
- Do they come off?

179
00:16:58,385 --> 00:16:59,717
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

180
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:30,681
Hey, the
water is off in 6A.

181
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:34,052
Oh no, I paid. I paid that.

182
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:37,256
Huh?

183
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,092
Who else can I talk to?

184
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:00,611
<i>Payday Advance.</i>

185
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:02,213
Yeah. I'd
like to get a loan.

186
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:04,883
<i>How much?</i>

187
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:05,884
Uh, three hundred.

188
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:07,652
<i>Date of birth?</i>

189
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:09,821
11/11/98.

190
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:12,690
<i>And your driver's
license number?</i>

191
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:13,758
Yeah.

192
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,761
It's 3-5-3-6-2-4-7-1.

193
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,696
<i>Who's your bank?</i>

194
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,466
I don't have one.

195
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:24,802
<i>Okay, you'll need to open
a checking or savings account</i>

196
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,838
<i>and have it open at least a
month before we can help you...</i>

197
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,806
- I can't wait a month.<i>
- You can do it online or in person.</i>

198
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:30,341
<i>You'll just need
two forms of ID.</i>

199
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:34,479
Where else can I go?

200
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:37,849
<i>You could try a pawn shop.</i>

201
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,484
Thanks.

202
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,523
What is your full name?

203
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,359
Richard John Wincott.

204
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:37,329
Address?

205
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:39,964
6A Ellington.

206
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:46,405
You employed?

207
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,706
Uh, yes. Uh, no. I was.

208
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,024
What was the name
of the company?

209
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,012
Hiddleston Utilities.

210
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:03,354
You ever, uh,

211
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:05,956
you ever late with your rent?

212
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,325
Oh, no. I'm not late.

213
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:13,612
When was the last time you seen Ms. LaField,
your landlord?

214
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:20,004
It was about a door I fixed.

215
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,040
- That was about a reimbursement?
- Yes, sir.

216
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,581
What was your relationship
like with your landlord?

217
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:33,617
- Relationship?
- Yeah.

218
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:35,386
You get along?

219
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:37,689
Yeah.

220
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:49,428
You know of anybody maybe didn't get along? Had
debts that might have led to anger towards her?

221
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:54,071
No.

222
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:02,813
Ms. LaField was killed
and her office was robbed.

223
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:11,889
You need anything?

224
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:19,563
<i>Four games played
and all at Baylor ballpark.</i>

225
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:23,000
<i>A woman found dead has
now been ruled a homicide.</i>

226
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:28,572
<i>It was sad because you think who would
really want to hurt such a wonderful person.</i>

227
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:31,742
<i>Neighbors tell us she
was much more than a landlady.</i>

228
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,828
<i>She was like family.</i>

229
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,913
<i>If you was late with your rent,
she didn't pester you.</i>

230
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:37,765
<i>Or bothered you.</i>

231
00:23:37,766 --> 00:23:39,616
<i>You could have been late
up to probably two months,</i>

232
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:41,819
<i>and she still would
have cut you a break.</i>

233
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:44,822
<i>Then she'll say to you, "Okay.
Are you hungry? Do you want some dinner?"</i>

234
00:23:44,824 --> 00:23:46,791
<i>She was a very nice person.</i>

235
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:48,492
<i>Very compassionate.</i>

236
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:50,661
How much for
a train to Shreveport?

237
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:53,631
No Shreveport.
We can do New Orleans.

238
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,166
How much?

239
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:57,768
The train leaves at 6:30.

240
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,638
The coach seat
is fifty-eight dollars.

241
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,544
You have uh, three hours, sir.

242
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:40,712
You need some help?

243
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:43,547
It's not mine.

244
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:46,183
Can't drive stick.

245
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:49,720
You want me to try?

246
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:51,188
It's okay.

247
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,556
I should call someone.

248
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,800
Uh. I don't mind driving you somewhere
if you've got somewhere to be.

249
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:33,764
You can wait inside.

250
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:36,233
I'll call you an Uber.

251
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:38,035
Where you going?

252
00:25:39,305 --> 00:25:40,804
No. That's okay.

253
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:42,907
I was headed to this
side of town anyway.

254
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:44,942
No, you weren't.

255
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:48,579
What's your name?

256
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:51,649
Richie.

257
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:54,051
Joan.

258
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:17,107
You from here?

259
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:19,910
Killeen.

260
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,279
Army brat?

261
00:26:22,982 --> 00:26:24,014
No.

262
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:28,586
Big family affair
left all this with me.

263
00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:35,225
- I'm okay.
- It'll go bad.

264
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:41,065
I'll make you a plate.

265
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,870
You like it
this quiet out here?

266
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:23,340
Not always.

267
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,013
It's nice.

268
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:35,219
You live all alone?

269
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:38,856
For now.

270
00:27:45,131 --> 00:27:46,131
You married?

271
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:50,367
No.

272
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:57,274
I was.

273
00:28:11,257 --> 00:28:12,257
It's cold.

274
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:12,416
Even if you're not working
at this moment, you're on.

275
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:15,018
Okay? Our job is to make
the guests feel welcome.

276
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,155
Even if it's not something you need to do,
you find somebody for them.

277
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:21,391
Okay? And then you want to
make sure... I'll be right there-

278
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:25,496
if they offer you a tip,
respectfully decline it at first.

279
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:28,832
But if they insist,
you can accept it.

280
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:31,135
You've earned it, okay?
But only if they insist.

281
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:46,250
Look, when they do it
it's really important

282
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:51,021
that the lapels be pressed above the
button-hole and above the buttons.

283
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:13,076
- How you been?
- What are you doing here?

284
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:17,548
You don't write. You don't
call. What's a gal to do?

285
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,550
You follow me in here?

286
00:30:19,552 --> 00:30:21,485
I saw you outside.

287
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:24,054
In your nice new
uniform. Very sharp.

288
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:29,893
You know... you know?

289
00:30:31,597 --> 00:30:33,263
We work together.

290
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:35,032
Uh.

291
00:30:35,034 --> 00:30:36,034
Yeah.

292
00:30:43,976 --> 00:30:44,976
Swim?

293
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,194
Think about everything
that goes on.

294
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:06,524
Everything that we can't see.

295
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:12,536
The women in this hotel
that you wouldn't believe.

296
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:15,606
Not like her. You know, bigger.

297
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:19,309
My May. My Mona.

298
00:31:21,914 --> 00:31:22,980
Your May what?

299
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:24,047
Come on, can't you just
give me a little kiss?

300
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,883
Uh. Fine.

301
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,552
This is Richie.

302
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:32,806
- Hi, Richie.
- Hi.

303
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:37,059
Now, Mona is here at the hotel very often so
you will probably be running into her a lot.

304
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:40,364
So, I wanted you guys
to meet each other.

305
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:42,065
Stop telling
all my business.

306
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,234
Was this today?

307
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:48,338
- Yes? This was today? This was today.
- This was like an hour ago.

308
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:50,521
How many people
you seen today?

309
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:56,213
- She's got to think about it.
- What time is it like seven? Eight?

310
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,684
Richie's an orphan.

311
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:06,123
He don't have any folks.

312
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:07,958
I'm sorry to hear that.

313
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:10,961
I didn't have a dad so...

314
00:32:13,332 --> 00:32:15,265
We don't
have to talk about it.

315
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,669
You're so shy.

316
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:49,132
Well that's what
I get out of a liar, isn't it?

317
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:51,401
Come on, baby.

318
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:55,005
Now that was my first one!
How'd you like that one?

319
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:10,487
So, our old lady, huh?

320
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:13,590
What about her?

321
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,260
She's dead.

322
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:21,164
Just like we said.

323
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:23,433
Don't say that.

324
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:24,435
No?

325
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:32,542
On the bus, that one night,
we didn't talk about it?

326
00:33:36,582 --> 00:33:37,881
No.

327
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:39,181
Yeah, we did!
We talked about it.

328
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,318
I just said that we didn't
like her. That's all.

329
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,421
No. No. No. I... Richie, I
got a good memory, buddy.

330
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:28,799
Working together.

331
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:33,537
And we drink to that.

332
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:53,591
Hey.

333
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:04,802
You see this?

334
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:06,870
This is the south side.

335
00:35:06,872 --> 00:35:08,622
Don't get hit by that car.

336
00:35:08,623 --> 00:35:10,373
- Whoa!
- Nothing but fields and churches, Richie.

337
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:11,641

You want to fly
around a little bit?

349
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:31,681
Yeah, just go up two blocks.

350
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:47,530
Right, here's good.

351
00:37:57,743 --> 00:37:59,809
We don't see
things clearly, yet.

352
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:03,813
We're squinting in a fog.
Peering through a mist.

353
00:38:05,017 --> 00:38:09,319
We hope unswervingly
and we love extravagantly.

354
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:13,056
Let no one be cruel.

355
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:16,559
Let no one be proud.

356
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:19,396
Let us not revenge.

357
00:38:20,032 --> 00:38:22,932
Let us not be
conquered by anger.

358
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,803
Now is the day of joy.

359
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:28,672
Of goodwill.

360
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:30,473
Of peace.

361
00:38:54,633 --> 00:38:55,999
You're following me.

362
00:38:57,102 --> 00:38:59,069
You've got that stick
shift down, huh?

363
00:38:59,071 --> 00:39:01,538
I'm better.
I practiced all morning.

364
00:39:01,907 --> 00:39:03,340
These going in or out?

365
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:05,709
Out.

366
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,617
Oh. I'm so stupid.

367
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,119
I think my keys were in there.

368
00:39:17,055 --> 00:39:19,689
I set my purse down.
I wasn't thinking.

369
00:39:20,492 --> 00:39:22,492
What do you do?
Do you call triple A?

370
00:39:25,364 --> 00:39:26,463
I can get it out.

371
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:28,665
Could I?

372
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,899
Where'd you learn that?

373
00:40:03,535 --> 00:40:04,701
Foster dad.

374
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:18,782
Do you mind if I take a few?

375
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:21,852
What's this?

376
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:23,953
Tortilla toss.

377
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:25,989
Yeah?

378
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:30,894
- You first.
- So, you've got to throw it... oh look, they got one on.

379
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:32,862
It's like, uh, horseshoes.

380
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:33,830
Yeah.

381
00:40:33,832 --> 00:40:34,931
Okay?

382
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:37,500
Ready?

383
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:48,912
Oh! Really.

384
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:06,896
Feels old fashioned
to go on a walk.

385
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:11,701
My Nana used to say, "Never make a big
decision without going on a walk."

386
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:15,805
You've got a big
decision to make?

387
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:19,209
Maybe.

388
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:26,015
You play things kind of close
to the chest, don't you?

389
00:41:26,618 --> 00:41:28,852
- What does that mean?
- It means you're secretive.

390
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:30,854
I'm not secretive.

391
00:41:30,856 --> 00:41:32,856
So, why'd you want
to go on a walk?

392
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,226
I like you.

393
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:47,103
This was always a summer
spot for me in high school.

394
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,824
Hmm?

395
00:41:50,825 --> 00:41:53,265
This was always a summer spot for
me when I was in high school.

396
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:54,878
Where did you go?

397
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,945
Waco High.

398
00:41:57,249 --> 00:41:58,548
You?

399
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,550
McLennan.

400
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:01,985
That's for rough kids.

401
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:05,989
Did you go to Baylor?

402
00:42:05,991 --> 00:42:06,991
No.

403
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:10,159
I lost interest.

404
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:14,731
My dad got sick, and I
just forgot about school.

405
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:15,965
He was a teacher.

406
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:18,701
He would have hated that.

407
00:42:21,606 --> 00:42:22,906
Can't you still go?

408
00:42:28,947 --> 00:42:30,547
Things keep changing.

409
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:36,686
You'd be a good teacher.

410
00:42:44,796 --> 00:42:48,565
I have a New Year's Party
on Friday night at my work.

411
00:42:49,935 --> 00:42:51,034
I have to go.

412
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:54,804
Do you want to come with me?

413
00:42:56,975 --> 00:42:58,007
Yeah, I do.

414
00:43:47,926 --> 00:43:49,392
- Hi.
- Hey.

415
00:43:55,266 --> 00:43:57,300
I thought I'd get a jacket.

416
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:58,701
I see that.

417
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,640
That's a really nice dress.

418
00:44:04,242 --> 00:44:05,942
I'm trying for the new year.

419
00:44:09,914 --> 00:44:11,247
It was one of my dad's.

420
00:44:29,701 --> 00:44:31,134
Did your dad make you do this?

421
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:33,169
No.

422
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:49,218
- You look amazing!
- So, do you! I guess we're late.

423
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,687
No, no! We just started.

424
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:52,022
Okay.

425
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:53,356
It's so good to see you.
We should catch up soon.

426
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:55,258
Yeah. Sure thing.
We'll go get a drink.

427
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,392
Okay.

428
00:45:17,816 --> 00:45:20,400
You remember Melinda?

429
00:45:20,401 --> 00:45:22,985
- Of course. Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year, sweetie.

430
00:45:23,855 --> 00:45:25,488
This is my friend, Richie.

431
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:27,423
- How you doing?
- Richie.

432
00:45:27,425 --> 00:45:28,791
You've got a good one here.

433
00:45:28,793 --> 00:45:29,792
We all love her.

434
00:45:29,794 --> 00:45:30,426
Yes, sir.

435
00:45:30,428 --> 00:45:31,427
Where'd you find it?

436
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:33,229
Um, my mother bought it for me.

437
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:36,299
- Oh. Nice. Well, it's nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

438
00:46:02,293 --> 00:46:04,026
So how long you
two been together?

439
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:05,928
Not long.

440
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:09,632
Good.

441
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:12,000
Good for you, man.
She's uh, she's great.

442
00:46:12,003 --> 00:46:16,005
She's uh... I've known her a long time.
So, how did you two meet?

443
00:46:18,176 --> 00:46:19,442
Who are you?

444
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:20,910
I'm Jamie.

445
00:46:20,912 --> 00:46:22,011
Richie.

446
00:46:22,881 --> 00:46:23,913
Yeah.

447
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:25,782
All right.

448
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:39,228
- I love that on you. It looks great.
- Thanks.

449
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:41,014
Are your earrings new?

450
00:46:41,015 --> 00:46:42,799
I got them like a year...
like our last anniversary.

451
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:44,801
They're maybe like a year old.

452
00:46:44,803 --> 00:46:45,835
Did you see her?

453
00:46:45,837 --> 00:46:49,505
A divorce. A death. And
she still finds time to date?

454
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:51,791
You are so mean.

455
00:46:51,792 --> 00:46:54,076
He's cute, right? He just
seems a little young for her.

456
00:46:54,078 --> 00:46:55,778
Right?

457
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:58,225
What do you want her to do?
Stay at home all day wearing black?

458
00:46:58,249 --> 00:46:59,482
It's her choice.

459
00:47:23,141 --> 00:47:24,240
Hey.

460
00:47:24,976 --> 00:47:26,108
You okay?

461
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,176
Yeah. I'm fine.

462
00:47:28,847 --> 00:47:34,083
Ten, nine,
eight, seven, six,

463
00:47:34,085 --> 00:47:39,622
five, four, three, two, one.

464
00:47:39,624 --> 00:47:43,192
Happy New Year!

465
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,133
I want you to stay over,

466
00:48:58,937 --> 00:49:01,270
but I don't want to sleep
together tonight.

467
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:09,345
I haven't told you.

468
00:49:11,516 --> 00:49:12,516
Um...

469
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:15,718
I can't sleep.

470
00:49:19,223 --> 00:49:22,558
I have to take these pills to close my eyes.
I see things at night.

471
00:49:25,596 --> 00:49:28,230
I lost my mom. Last month.

472
00:49:34,238 --> 00:49:36,005
Now, I don't want to be alone.

473
00:49:40,278 --> 00:49:41,310
I'll stay.

474
00:49:48,186 --> 00:49:49,652
Uh, good night.

475
00:49:50,722 --> 00:49:51,988
Good night.

476
00:50:21,452 --> 00:50:23,119
- Hello.
- How y'all doing?

477
00:50:23,121 --> 00:50:24,754
- Good. How are you?
- All right.

478
00:50:24,756 --> 00:50:28,090
Mind if I talk to Miss uh Melanie
in private for a few moments?

479
00:50:28,092 --> 00:50:30,052
- Of course. She's right over there.
- Appreciate it.

480
00:50:43,274 --> 00:50:48,577
The person we're closing in on,
your mother believed to be harmless enough

481
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:53,749
to allow access to the leasing office
after hours for whatever reason.

482
00:50:54,285 --> 00:51:00,723
Now there is a good chance that the profile
of the person is a desperate individual who

483
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:03,426
wanted money for drugs
or pay off debt. But,

484
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:08,798
it's also possible that it's
someone your mom took a shine to.

485
00:51:09,667 --> 00:51:15,137
So, you think on it, and you let me know if
you ever remember her mentioning somebody new

486
00:51:15,139 --> 00:51:17,073
in her life these
past few weeks.

487
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:21,811
Somebody she would have
had no reason not to trust.

488
00:51:25,316 --> 00:51:26,382
Thank you.

489
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:28,350
Yes, ma'am.

490
00:51:46,337 --> 00:51:48,504
Some guy's asking
for you downstairs.

491
00:52:00,151 --> 00:52:01,584
You were moved

492
00:52:01,586 --> 00:52:06,622
three times in five months between foster
homes when you were thirteen. How come?

493
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,392
Cause.

494
00:52:14,866 --> 00:52:18,767
Me and one of those foster
moms didn't really get along.

495
00:52:18,769 --> 00:52:20,136
You fight her?

496
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:22,425
I've been reading up on you.

497
00:52:23,407 --> 00:52:25,174
You know how to
handle yourself, huh?

498
00:52:26,444 --> 00:52:30,679
I bet you also know
how to run away, too.

499
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:32,715
Right? Things get too hot.

500
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:34,416
Ain't that right, Richie?

501
00:52:36,187 --> 00:52:37,920
You know what
that's called? Hm?

502
00:52:40,224 --> 00:52:46,395
It's called "Fight or
Flight." It's evolutionary.

503
00:52:47,465 --> 00:52:51,567
Comes out of us when
we sense a threat.

504
00:52:51,569 --> 00:52:54,470
All those juices inside of us,

505
00:52:55,173 --> 00:53:00,409
that adrenaline, tells our brain,
our muscles, everything what to do.

506
00:53:01,812 --> 00:53:03,479
Most people don't
have to live like that,

507
00:53:04,282 --> 00:53:05,922
but you have your whole
life. Haven't you?

508
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:08,217
Ain't that right?

509
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:12,655
Yeah. I guess so.

510
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:21,864
Now, what would you do if I told you that
your fingerprints were all over that office?

511
00:53:23,334 --> 00:53:25,701
We've also found a witness

512
00:53:27,238 --> 00:53:29,972
that said he saw you leave
the site at eight o'clock.

513
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:35,277
Now, that's a whole hour and
a half later than you told me.

514
00:53:37,748 --> 00:53:39,908
- I didn't do anything.
- Let me tell you what happened.

515
00:53:40,851 --> 00:53:42,318
It was all about the money.

516
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:48,224
You needed a little bit of cash to cover
some loose ends... pay some bills.

517
00:53:48,226 --> 00:53:50,626
Hey, I get it. Look,
we've all been there.

518
00:53:52,763 --> 00:53:54,530
You ain't no killer.
I know that.

519
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,333
But you got scared,

520
00:53:58,803 --> 00:54:00,669
and that's why
the land lady's dead.

521
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,472
It was just about the money,

522
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:06,442
and it went wrong.

523
00:54:09,247 --> 00:54:12,548
And there was a second
safe in that office.

524
00:54:13,651 --> 00:54:16,685
Stuffed full, but you
didn't know that.

525
00:54:17,722 --> 00:54:18,787
You didn't see it.

526
00:54:21,792 --> 00:54:23,626
And there was another drawer

527
00:54:23,628 --> 00:54:30,628
with three hundred and fifty in petty cash,
but you only wanted a little bit to get by.

528
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:33,002
You weren't greedy.

529
00:54:38,976 --> 00:54:43,379
What do you think the outcome of all of
this will be for the person who did it?

530
00:55:02,533 --> 00:55:03,666
Hey.

531
00:55:06,604 --> 00:55:07,836
Need a ride?

532
00:55:08,906 --> 00:55:10,406
No. I'm good.

533
00:55:10,408 --> 00:55:11,607
I don't mind.

534
00:55:23,988 --> 00:55:24,988
Hold up.

535
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:28,691
Come on. Where
you got to be, huh?

536
00:55:28,693 --> 00:55:29,758
Go away.

537
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,726
Here.

538
00:55:30,728 --> 00:55:31,827
Come on. This way.

539
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:32,995
I got to go to work.

540
00:55:37,601 --> 00:55:39,501
You're not joking around, huh?

541
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:43,706
Is this the serious,
serious you?

542
00:55:44,542 --> 00:55:45,574
Come on.

543
00:55:54,485 --> 00:55:56,051
I need your help right now.

544
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:03,492
Please help me.

545
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:10,499
Please.

546
00:56:12,403 --> 00:56:13,469
I can't.

547
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:20,776
All it would take is just one little word,
Richie, for me to knock things down.

548
00:56:24,615 --> 00:56:26,482
You've got cops at your work.

549
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:28,551
At your house.

550
00:56:31,155 --> 00:56:32,454
What do you want?

551
00:56:32,456 --> 00:56:33,756
I want you to get in the van.

552
00:56:35,459 --> 00:56:36,792
We'll get a coffee first.

553
00:56:41,799 --> 00:56:43,499
I don't like you.

554
00:56:43,501 --> 00:56:44,733
You're going down, come on.

555
00:56:49,173 --> 00:56:50,973
Keep going. Keep
going. Keep going.

556
00:56:50,975 --> 00:56:53,041
Harder. Harder. Harder.

557
00:56:53,043 --> 00:56:54,910
Harder. Come on. Harder. Harder.

558
00:57:18,702 --> 00:57:20,536
I know everything about you.

559
00:57:23,507 --> 00:57:24,807
You're a lot like me.

560
00:57:26,744 --> 00:57:30,813
I was in and out of juvie.
I had a teacher that really liked to rag on.

561
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:34,950
She never stopped.

562
00:57:35,453 --> 00:57:40,856
I snapped and hit her until she
was black and blue all over.

563
00:57:42,526 --> 00:57:44,693
It was ten minutes before
they could pull me off her.

564
00:57:45,696 --> 00:57:47,062
I was that mad.

565
00:57:51,035 --> 00:57:54,903
Everybody always tries to tie you down.
Tell you what to do.

566
00:57:56,006 --> 00:57:59,641
I've got nothing to confess, you understand?
No money. No real money.

567
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:00,843
No jobs.

568
00:58:00,845 --> 00:58:02,144
No folks.

569
00:58:02,746 --> 00:58:04,680
But we're all right, right?

570
00:58:05,749 --> 00:58:07,115
I do what I can.

571
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:10,252
It's all I've got.

572
00:58:16,894 --> 00:58:18,494
I don't hurt people.

573
00:58:24,768 --> 00:58:26,168
You mean on purpose?

574
00:58:29,073 --> 00:58:30,272
We're born alone,

575
00:58:30,274 --> 00:58:33,542
we live alone
and we die alone.

576
00:58:34,745 --> 00:58:35,745
That's it.

577
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,212
It's nothing.

578
00:58:39,283 --> 00:58:40,983
And that's freedom, Richie.

579
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:46,688
People talk about having
it all the time, right?

580
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:54,930
What if it's a really little room? Really
dark with little cobwebs up in the corner.

581
00:59:07,978 --> 00:59:10,212
We're going to a place
that I've been working on.

582
00:59:11,115 --> 00:59:13,082
We'll be in and
out really quick.

583
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:15,123
Just stick close to me,
and we'll fly through, okay?

584
00:59:15,753 --> 00:59:19,721
I paid the maid two-hundred for a
master key over at the Motor Inn.

585
00:59:20,991 --> 00:59:24,593
Other than taking this wheel and killing
us both, you don't have a choice.

586
00:59:26,163 --> 00:59:27,663
I own you.

587
01:00:24,355 --> 01:00:25,687
Come on.

588
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,637
You want something to eat?

589
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:10,298
Come on.

590
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:43,932
Sorry.

591
01:03:00,811 --> 01:03:01,910
Get over there.

592
01:03:01,912 --> 01:03:02,912
Hurry!

593
01:03:17,795 --> 01:03:19,394
Sorry! Housekeeping.

594
01:04:47,451 --> 01:04:48,583
Yeah.

595
01:04:49,887 --> 01:04:50,952
Hey!

596
01:04:52,522 --> 01:04:54,656
You took everything from me!

597
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:57,993
You don't remember?

598
01:04:58,528 --> 01:05:00,428
Give me back my things!

599
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:10,498
I shouldn't drive.

600
01:06:15,505 --> 01:06:17,405
I quit my job this morning.

601
01:06:21,411 --> 01:06:23,011
I don't know why.

602
01:06:27,584 --> 01:06:29,117
I just needed to sleep.

603
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:31,020
That's all.

604
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:36,291
You know I was dreaming?

605
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,733
I hate being alone.

606
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,439
I'm going away for a while.

607
01:06:53,543 --> 01:06:54,576
Where?

608
01:06:57,681 --> 01:06:58,713
West.

609
01:07:05,589 --> 01:07:06,721
Why?

610
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:15,230
I need to get straight.
I can't be here anymore.

611
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:17,800
Hm.

612
01:07:22,706 --> 01:07:24,139
You'll take me with you.

613
01:07:29,046 --> 01:07:30,046
Hey.

614
01:07:32,182 --> 01:07:33,481
Hey. I know you.

615
01:07:35,052 --> 01:07:36,217
I know you.

616
01:07:37,788 --> 01:07:38,788
Yeah.

617
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:41,423
Okay? It's me.

618
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:37,172
I'm bleeding.

619
01:09:37,741 --> 01:09:38,773
You're bleeding?

620
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:44,346
Me too.

621
01:10:20,483 --> 01:10:22,417
I want to see the stars tonight.

622
01:11:10,934 --> 01:11:12,800
I didn't tell you the truth.

623
01:11:16,039 --> 01:11:17,538
My mother was killed.

624
01:11:19,342 --> 01:11:20,408
Murdered.

625
01:11:21,678 --> 01:11:22,777
Last month.

626
01:11:25,749 --> 01:11:26,749
I didn't know

627
01:11:27,684 --> 01:11:29,350
how to say it, so

628
01:11:32,022 --> 01:11:33,022
I didn't.

629
01:11:36,326 --> 01:11:37,592
It was at her work.

630
01:11:38,995 --> 01:11:40,061
At night.

631
01:11:41,898 --> 01:11:43,064
They robbed her.

632
01:11:45,735 --> 01:11:47,335
I should have told you.

633
01:11:48,004 --> 01:11:49,004
I'm sorry.

634
01:16:11,334 --> 01:16:12,767
<i>My only friend.</i>

635
01:16:17,206 --> 01:16:18,639
<i>I've hurt you.</i>

636
01:19:25,228 --> 01:19:28,863
Aimed at a subway. He
ended up in the hospital.

637
01:19:28,865 --> 01:19:32,166
- We need to figure out if he was in fact...
- Excuse me.

638
01:19:38,775 --> 01:19:39,940
Where you going, son?

639
01:19:56,859 --> 01:19:57,958
I killed her.

640
01:20:00,797 --> 01:20:02,329
I tried to stop her
from screaming,

641
01:20:04,267 --> 01:20:05,933
and then, I
robbed the office.

642
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:14,942
Do you have any voices in your head
that other people don't seem to hear?

643
01:20:14,944 --> 01:20:16,561
No.

644
01:20:16,562 --> 01:20:18,891
Do you currently believe that
someone can control your mind?

645
01:20:18,915 --> 01:20:20,604
No.

646
01:20:20,605 --> 01:20:22,294
Prior to arrest, did you
feel down, depressed

647
01:20:22,295 --> 01:20:23,984
or have little interest or
pleasure in doing things?

648
01:20:23,986 --> 01:20:26,587
No.

649
01:20:26,588 --> 01:20:29,189
Do you have any nightmares, flashbacks, or
repeated thoughts or feelings related to PTSD

650
01:20:29,192 --> 01:20:31,025
or something terrible
from your past?

651
01:20:32,361 --> 01:20:33,361
Yes.

652
01:20:40,837 --> 01:20:41,936
Now look right here.

653
01:20:46,075 --> 01:20:48,635
Put your right shoulder on the wall
and face straight to the left.

654
01:20:51,147 --> 01:20:52,913
Same thing facing
the other direction.

655
01:20:56,085 --> 01:20:59,125
All righty. Now turn and put your back
flat on the board one more time for me.

656
01:22:36,085 --> 01:22:39,253
I came back to this
house I was staying at.

657
01:22:42,391 --> 01:22:43,657
The folks were okay.

658
01:22:45,428 --> 01:22:48,462
There were two suitcases
on the front porch.

659
01:22:51,367 --> 01:22:52,367
Mine.

660
01:22:53,102 --> 01:22:54,268
I was eleven.

661
01:22:55,371 --> 01:22:56,403
That was it.

662
01:22:57,573 --> 01:22:58,739
No heads up.

663
01:23:01,744 --> 01:23:03,243
I guess they had enough.

664
01:23:03,713 --> 01:23:05,279
I was in a new home that night.

665
01:23:15,691 --> 01:23:17,558
I've never told that
to anybody before.

666
01:27:00,983 --> 01:27:02,616
I'm at U of H.

667
01:27:10,693 --> 01:27:12,426
It's nice where I live now.

668
01:27:23,906 --> 01:27:26,340
I have visions of what happened.

669
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:30,844
They haunt me.

670
01:27:38,387 --> 01:27:40,354
What made you do all that?

671
01:27:44,793 --> 01:27:47,027
First, I thought
you were a monster,

672
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:50,697
and that you deserve
no compassion.

673
01:27:52,868 --> 01:27:56,603
I find myself at the post
office with letters for you,

674
01:27:57,373 --> 01:27:59,973
and I think to myself,
"What are you doing?

675
01:28:02,778 --> 01:28:04,344
Why should I write you?"

676
01:28:05,281 --> 01:28:06,513
You're nothing to me.

677
01:28:13,289 --> 01:28:14,421
I pray for you.

678
01:28:15,891 --> 01:28:18,325
I curse your name,
but I pray for you.

679
01:28:19,695 --> 01:28:21,828
I know that you have
no one in the world.

680
01:28:32,608 --> 01:28:33,874
I don't hate you.

681
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:40,347
But I hate what you did to me.

682
01:28:45,854 --> 01:28:47,321
I want peace.

683
01:28:49,958 --> 01:28:51,325
For both of us.

684
01:28:54,897 --> 01:28:55,929
So,

685
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:00,600
