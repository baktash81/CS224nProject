I am talking freaky, deaky, Dutch.

20
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,839
If yöu were to lock me away in a
white room, in a straitjacket,

21
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,319
it would actually feel comforting.

22
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,159
As long as the walls were
spotless and nobody wore shoes.

23
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,519
I can actually feel
the house getting dirty.

24
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,119
Like I have nerve
endings in the carpet.

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,399

D-I-S... Oh, what was I...

29
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,599
So, see, like right now,

30
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,959
I'm thinking of the cleaning
supplies I left out

31
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,559
and how one of the kids is
gonna get up and drink Clorox

32
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,879
and then I'd end up having
to call Poison Control,

33
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,919
and they'd say,

34
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,879
"Sorry, Mrs. Field,
too many times this month."

35
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,199
And take my kids away.

After I feel distracted,
I feel stressed.

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,805

with my daughter.

47
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,319
Hon, (CLEARS THROAT)
about the stress level.

48
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,319
- (SIGHS) What?
- Well, it's a little high.

49
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,159
- Gee, uh...
- The kind of psycho thing yöu just did...

50
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,399
Did yöu just call me psycho?

51
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,119
- No! No. No. No.
- Did yöu just call me psycho?

52
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,646
It was a little psycho.

53
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,239
This is me having a moment
with some helpless newlyweds.

54
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,247

And savor this moment in yöur life!

I thought it would help.

But then the words just started
coming out of me like lava.

I can't say no.

517
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,839
I start on Saturday night
and I was hoping

518
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,526
yöu could watch Phoenix
while I work.

519
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,278
- Saturday night?
- Mmm..hmm.

520
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:53,079
Oh, yeah, um, normally, yes.

521
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,639
But I'm actually glad
yöu brought that up

522
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,599
because I planned this,
uh, moms' night thing.

523
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,799
- BRIDGET: Oh.
- Yöu what?

524
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,247
For Saturday.

525
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,639
Yöu planned a moms' night?

526
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,087
I did. I planned one.

527
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,839
BRIDGET: Yöu always babysit
Phoenix on the weekends.

528
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,679
(LAUGHS) I was sort of counting
on yöu when I got the job.

529
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,684
Yeah, um...

530
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,639
Yöu know when a flight attendant

531
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,039
goes through the safety thing?

532
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,279
Yöu know when they say, uh, yöu have
to put on yöur oxygen mask first

533
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,319
- before assisting others?
- Are we flying somewhere?

534
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,599
Is this what we're...

535
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,999
Yeah. Yeah, yöu need
yöur oxygen mask.

536
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,839
Yöu have to have yöur mask
on before assisting others.

537
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,159
- Ah.
- Right? Before yöu can help others!

538
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,439
BRIDGET: Wow, Sean. We get it!

539
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,679
It's a metaphor. I think we both...
We got it.

540
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,999
It's a very good metaphor. Thank
yöu for pointing that out.

541
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,159
Yöu're welcome.

542
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,919

- Really?
- It's Saturday.

546
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,319
Oh, no! Sean can't play video games

547
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,839
on Saturday night
with his loser friends.

548
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,239
First of all, that's low.
Yöu don't even know Kevin.

549
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,639
I know Kevin.

550

ALLYSON: Kevin is Sean's friend.

551
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,999
Sean met Kevin when they
were in the fifth grade.

(BLOWING)

553
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,879
They started playing video
games as juveniles.

554
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,839
They still play video
games like juveniles.

555
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,519

behind me, move over!

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,519
ALLYSON: Kevin hates kids.

560
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,719
Well, I hate kids.

561
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,799
Yöu don't hate kids.

562
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,119
I hate kids.

563
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,119
ALLYSON: Somehow Sean
justifies this relationship.

564
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,199
No, I didn't shoot yöu.

565
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,759
The guy behind yöu shot yöu.

566
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,959

transition from work stress.

That's my oxygen!

568
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,439
I put mine on, video,
I can help yöu put yöurs on,

569
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,519
and then yöu can help
the rest of the world.

570
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,719
Thank yöu.

00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,279
(SIGHS) Who's gonna watch
the baby? What about Joey?

572
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,039
ALLYSON: Joey is Bridget's ex.

573
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,090
He's a fun guy.

574
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,439
In a non-committal, allergic to
all responsibility kind of way.

575
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,479
No. I tried that.

576
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,399
SEAN: Here's the thing,
yöu're going out

577
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,439
and I'm gonna, uh, watch Phoenix.

578
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,279
- ALLYSON: Yöu're gonna watch Phoenix?
- I will watch Phoenix.

Big brother to the rescue once
again and everybody's happy.

580
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,319
I don't need yöur charity and I
certainly don't need yöur metaphors.

581
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,719
So I'm gonna go

582
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,319
get yöu to bed 'cause that's
the responsible thing to do.

583

And also, uh, Marco's
bringing the twins over

590
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,039

to watch them alone.

would go whimpering into

He killed Mama.

the criminals off now.
