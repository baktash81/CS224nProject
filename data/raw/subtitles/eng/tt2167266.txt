[MUSIC - ICE T, "THE GAME STOPS HERE"]

2
00:00:12,577 --> 00:00:14,840
[SINGING] First off,
I got a mind of my own.

3
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:16,364
I don't need nobody
telling me the way

4
00:00:16,494 --> 00:00:17,930
I live my life ain't right.

5
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:20,455
Don't need nobody in myface trying to kick no bass,

6
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:22,283
telling me that I'm
way out of my place.

7
00:00:22,413 --> 00:00:23,632
Kiss my ass, ma.

8
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:25,460
I'm gonna live my
life the way I wanna.

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,985
Kick back on the corner, drinka little, smoke a little.

10
00:00:29,116 --> 00:00:30,987
Drink a little more,
smoke a little more.

11
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:33,207
Do a tab of ecstasy,
run up in the store.

12
00:00:33,337 --> 00:00:35,600
Wild out with my homies
every night and day.

13
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:38,429
Life's a game, all it
takes is guts to play.

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,953
And the way I play, I don'tcare nothing about rules.

15
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:43,434
Anybody over 18 to me is a fool.

16
00:00:43,565 --> 00:00:46,176
'Cause no matter what I
do, they can't touch me.

17
00:00:46,307 --> 00:00:47,917
No matter what I
do, you gotta set

18
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,224
me free, 'cause I'm the illeston the street and my crew rolls

19
00:00:50,354 --> 00:00:51,399
deep.

20
00:00:51,529 --> 00:00:53,009
All I want to do
is get buck wild.

21
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,228
I'm a juvenile.

22
00:00:54,358 --> 00:00:56,056
I ain't responsible
for what I do.

23
00:00:56,186 --> 00:00:58,841
I was just bugging, havingsome fun with my crew.

24
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:01,496
But it got out of hand,
now there's a dead man.

25
00:01:01,626 --> 00:01:03,324
The judge didn't understand.

26
00:01:03,454 --> 00:01:05,543
Said it was my
fault, tried my ass

27
00:01:05,674 --> 00:01:08,546
as an adult. The first time,and the state didn't hesitate.

28
00:01:08,677 --> 00:01:11,419
Gave me five years in the penright along with my friends,

29
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:14,596
and made it clear that
the game stopped here.

30

Why don't you get

Dear god, what are
you trying to do to me?

51
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,789
After everything I've beenthrough with your father.

52
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,314
I think it's all going tobe clear in just a moment.

53
00:02:20,444 --> 00:02:22,359
Please have a seat.

54
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,057
Peter, why don't you tellyour mother what you did?

55
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:27,669
I don't know what
you're talking about.

56
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:28,800
Where's my lawyer?

57
00:02:28,931 --> 00:02:29,845
Forget about this.

58
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:30,802
We don't need his testimony.

59
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:32,456
Hold on just a minute.

60
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:33,588
Your lawyer's on his way.

61
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:35,851
You can wait for
him if you want.

62
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:38,070
Or, you could
cooperate with us now.

63
00:02:46,296 --> 00:02:49,647
So where were you earliertoday, say about 3 PM?

64
00:02:49,778 --> 00:02:52,911
I was at the park all day,hanging out with my friends.

65
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:54,826
And then I went home,
where you found me.

66
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:57,525
This kid-- he's as
screwed up his old man.

67
00:02:57,655 --> 00:03:00,789
You don't know
shit about my father.

68
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,051
He's just going to lie.

69
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,444
Let's book him and
get on with this.

70
00:03:03,574 --> 00:03:04,749
Your buddies
told us everything.

We've got all the
evidence we need.

72

This is your opportunity
to cooperate.

00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:17,675
You know what, you
never bring shit.

74
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:20,765
You're a fucking little leechthat nobody wants around here.

Fuck you, pig.

I was just playing around.

88
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,450
I didn't mean any of it.

[train horn]

104
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:38,713
Do you have a death
wish or something?

105
00:04:41,846 --> 00:04:44,632
And why the tracks?

106
00:04:44,762 --> 00:04:45,589
You guys don't go there?

107
00:04:48,462 --> 00:04:49,854
It's the only place
where no one else is.

108
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:56,296
Are you going to work
over the holidays?

109
00:04:56,426 --> 00:04:58,646
Well, my dad wants
me to work with him.

110
00:04:58,776 --> 00:05:00,430
But that ain't happening.

111
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:03,651
I'm not gonna spend my
holidays banging nails.

112
00:05:03,781 --> 00:05:05,957
What about you?

113
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:08,264
Did you ever think about
working with your dad?

114
00:05:08,395 --> 00:05:09,831
Yeah.

115
00:05:09,961 --> 00:05:11,920
But I never knew enough.

116
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,879
And I'd always makemistakes and screw stuff up,

117
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,664
and made him mad.

118
00:05:16,794 --> 00:05:19,493
Hey, man, wanna
mess with the train?

119
00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:21,190
- Sure, let's do it.
- Go pull that switch.

120
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,626
Cool?
- Cool.

121
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:24,062
All right.

122
00:05:24,193 --> 00:05:25,063
I'm gonna go down the
tracks, and I'm gonna

123
00:05:25,194 --> 00:05:25,977
signal you when to pull it.

124
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:32,941
Hit it!

125
00:05:48,522 --> 00:05:50,915
That's it.

126
00:05:51,046 --> 00:05:53,570
I went home after that.

127
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:55,355

Let's go, kid.

132
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,014
You're nuts!

133
00:06:03,145 --> 00:06:03,841
What are you talking about?

134
00:06:03,972 --> 00:06:04,799
Manslaughter?

135
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:07,062
I didn't kill anybody!

136
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:10,587
Wait a second, I
don't think he knows.

137
00:06:10,718 --> 00:06:11,458
PETER: Knows what?

138
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:17,246
You killed a man today.

139
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,682
Fuck you.

140
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:19,596
Fuck you.

141
00:06:19,727 --> 00:06:20,989
I did not kill anybody!

142

I didn't kill anybody!

143
00:06:22,294 --> 00:06:23,774
Let go of me!

144
00:06:23,905 --> 00:06:27,996
I didn't kill anybody!

145
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:30,781
If it'd please the
court, at this time,

146
00:06:30,912 --> 00:06:34,481
the state of New Jersey wouldformally move this court

147
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:39,224
to wave three of these juvenilesup to the Superior Court

148
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:43,664
to be prosecuted as adults onthe charges of manslaughter

149
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:45,100
and aggravated assault.

150
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,798

referring, Mr. Grande?

Your Honor, we believethat the monstrous nature

154
00:06:59,854 --> 00:07:01,029
of these crimes--

155
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:03,945
the fact that this
was a commuter rail

156
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:08,558
filled with passengers
demands that these boys

157
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:09,690
be charged as adults.

158
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,866
Stop right there.

159
00:07:11,996 --> 00:07:14,172
It is the opinion ofthis court that the three

160
00:07:14,303 --> 00:07:16,000

I'll untie and gag you, takethe stock out of your mouth,

your fucking brains out.

195

I put on my vest
before my underwear.

Where have you been?

212
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:38,708
I've been in hiding.

213
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:40,231
I just worked and stayed home.

214
00:09:40,362 --> 00:09:41,668
I'm not really allowedto see any of my friends.

215
00:09:41,798 --> 00:09:43,365
It's my lawyer's idea.

216
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:44,932
You can't do this alone.

217
00:09:45,062 --> 00:09:47,151
Why not?

218
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:48,762
I know how to take
care of myself.

219
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:51,329
I've done everything
else on my own.

220
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,592
Yeah, I know.

221
00:09:52,722 --> 00:09:54,419
I really wish you'd change that.

226
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:07,519
Now, I have good news.

227
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,521
The prosecutor has
offered a plea bargain.

228
00:10:15,745 --> 00:10:17,138
Am I going to go to prison?

229
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:18,313
We don't know that yet.

230
00:10:18,443 --> 00:10:19,967
Let's take it one
step at a time.

231
00:10:20,097 --> 00:10:22,926
But if you accept the offer,he'll drop all charges

232
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:24,841
except for the manslaughter.

233
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:27,670
The max you would face
would be 10 years.

234
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:30,194
10 years?

235
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:31,543
What if we don't agree?

236
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:32,762
Well, then I think
you'll go to trial,

237
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:34,808
and you'll be convicted.

238
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:35,765
That would be 40 years.

239
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:39,769
40 years?

240
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,470

Come on, Don Juan.

250
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,666
I can make it on my own.

251
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:12,062
Hey, I hope you're
not too drunk.

252
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:28,600
You just gotta be quiet,'cause my parents are home.

00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:30,037

No!

00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:06,900
I just-- s-- s-- stop, OK?

259
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,901
Fuck.

260
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:08,771
OK.

00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:23,177
What are you doing here?

265
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:24,918
It's the middle of the night.

266
00:12:25,048 --> 00:12:26,006
I wanted to see you.

267
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:28,095
Can I come up?

268
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:29,183
OK.

269
00:12:29,313 --> 00:12:30,575
Come around to the back door.

270
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:38,583
PETER: I'm so scared.

271
00:12:38,714 --> 00:12:42,544
I don't wanna go.

272
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:46,156
I know that I killed someone,but I'm not a killer.

273
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:48,115
I know.

274
00:12:48,245 --> 00:12:49,029
It's going to be OK.

275
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:49,856
I promise.

276
00:12:52,728 --> 00:12:53,468
Just relax.

277
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,298
I'll let you know
when you have to go.

278
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,217
Can we just stay here forever?

279
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:04,522
Of course we can.

280
00:13:13,183 --> 00:13:13,923
BAILIFF: All rise.

281
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:27,545
This was a difficult decision.

282
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:30,287
It is imperative that wesend a message to other teens

283
00:13:30,418 --> 00:13:32,768
that they can't commit crimes
and get away with them.

284
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:34,422
There is also a
punishment factor

285
00:13:34,552 --> 00:13:37,642
here that must not be ignored.

286
00:13:37,773 --> 00:13:42,952
Nevertheless, it does not servesociety to compound losses

287
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:46,086
and ruin even more lives.

288
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:49,567
Therefore, weighing
all these issues,

289
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:53,267
I sentence you to five
years in state prison.

290

Just gonna offer you a
little friendly advice.

Don't sweat this stuff.

301

Follow directions.

302
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:47,887
You'll be all right.

303
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:49,584
Let me know if
you need any help.

See, you made it this far.

309

Not so bad.

Well, that stops here, Madagin.

316
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:52,473
You're not part of

You hear that, nigga?

364
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,177
That's what I'm talking about.

00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:56,874
Yo, let me tell
you something, son.

366
00:18:57,005 --> 00:18:59,007
When I was on the street, Iwas kicking it large, baby.

370
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:07,320
You see these white
folks over here?

371
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,191
These motherfuckers
think they can dance.

372
00:19:09,322 --> 00:19:10,888
They might wanna dance,
but the motherfuckers

373
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:12,368

I'll give you

388
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:35,130
We can talk about biting

00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:36,436

00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:38,525

What's up?

393
00:19:39,526 --> 00:19:40,962
Huh?

395
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:43,312
I don't see you doing shit!

396
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:45,053
You don't want me

397
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,141
That's what I thought!

398
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:47,795

403
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:56,630
No grease.

404
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,632
Open up your ass
like a mason jar.

405
00:19:58,762 --> 00:19:59,720

OK.

407

The entertainment is over.

OK?
Mess out.

409
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:13,386
Hey.

Mark.

411
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:18,173
Peter.

412
00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:19,348
How's it going?

413
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:20,349
All right.

414
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,742
Don't worry about that moly.

415
00:20:21,872 --> 00:20:23,831
He's a punk.

416
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:25,572
What are you in on?

417
00:20:25,702 --> 00:20:26,442
Manslaughter.

418
00:20:26,573 --> 00:20:28,052

419
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:29,619
Manslaughter.

420
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,013
And what's a white boylike you doing with a body?

421
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:35,843
What'd you do, get drunk
and run somebody over?

422
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:37,540
Yeah, something like that.

423
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:39,150
How much time'd you get?

424
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:40,151
Five years.

425
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:43,894
Five years on a body.

426
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:45,679
You must've had a good lawyer.

427
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:48,247
Bet you'll do about a year anda half if you don't screw up.

428
00:20:48,377 --> 00:20:49,465
Just stick with me and the boys.

429
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:50,292
You'll be all right.

430
00:21:23,238 --> 00:21:27,111
You say a word to anyoneabout this and you're dead.

431
00:21:27,242 --> 00:21:28,025
This I promise you.

432
00:21:35,076 --> 00:21:38,384
[sobbing]

433
00:22:01,581 --> 00:22:02,886
Do you, uh--

434
00:22:03,017 --> 00:22:04,845
Do you need me to bring
you anything from home?

435
00:22:04,975 --> 00:22:05,715
No.

436
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:06,629
I'm OK.

437
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:14,681
I brought some
books for you to read.

438
00:22:14,811 --> 00:22:17,553
A couple of detective stories.

439
00:22:17,684 --> 00:22:19,816
PETER: Thanks, Leslie.

440
00:22:19,947 --> 00:22:22,776
You're the greatest.

441
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:23,951
You know, mom, it's
gonna be really

442
00:22:24,081 --> 00:22:25,605
hard to see you every week.

443
00:22:25,735 --> 00:22:27,041
Oh.

444
00:22:27,171 --> 00:22:27,955
It just reminds me
of everything that I'm

445
00:22:28,085 --> 00:22:29,826
missing outside of here.

446
00:22:29,957 --> 00:22:32,263
It makes the time go
by so much slower.

447
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:34,831
I-- I don't understand.

448
00:22:34,962 --> 00:22:36,746
Shouldn't I come anymore?

449
00:22:36,877 --> 00:22:37,834
PHOTOGRAPHER: Smile.

450
00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:41,272
[click]

451
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:55,548
I'm just saying it's notnecessary to come every week.

452
00:22:55,678 --> 00:22:57,898
I'm your mother.

453
00:22:58,028 --> 00:22:59,639
I have to come see you.

454
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:02,206
What kind of a mother would Ibe if I didn't come see you?

455
00:23:02,337 --> 00:23:03,077
No.

456
00:23:03,207 --> 00:23:04,861
Mom, I want to see you.

457
00:23:04,992 --> 00:23:05,949
That's not what I'm saying!

458
00:23:08,778 --> 00:23:11,607
It's just that it makes ithard to lose track of time.

459
00:23:15,219 --> 00:23:16,264
Just forget it, all right?

460
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,134
All right.

461
00:23:22,705 --> 00:23:24,751
PETER: And take that
picture, all right?

462
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:26,709
No, it's for you
to take back with you

463
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,711
so you have a picture of us.

464
00:23:28,842 --> 00:23:29,843
I thought you
wanted the picture.

465
00:23:29,973 --> 00:23:31,279
It's for you.

466
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,063
Don't you want the picture?

467
00:23:33,194 --> 00:23:35,065
That-- That's not
what I'm saying!

468
00:23:35,196 --> 00:23:36,545
Jesus!

469
00:23:36,676 --> 00:23:37,416
Can I have the picture?

470
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:43,857
[chatter]

471
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:01,527
If you're just going tocopy the whole thing over,

472
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:02,876
you might as well
just buy another book.

473
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:07,620
It's just basic algebra.

474
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,447
Move on, inmate.

475
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:38,868
Come here for a second.

476
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:48,443
You know this stuff?

477
00:24:48,574 --> 00:24:50,227
Yeah, I guess.

478
00:24:50,358 --> 00:24:53,709
I'm stuck right here.

479
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,929
Why should I help you?

480
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:57,104
'Cause you're a decent guy.

481
00:25:00,237 --> 00:25:00,977
Let me see what you got.

482
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:10,944
Oh, yeah.

483
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:12,511
I see what you doing wrong.

484
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:14,251
Look, don't worry about it.It's a common mistake.

485
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:15,209
I can show you how to fix it.

486
00:25:19,822 --> 00:25:20,867
OFFICER CLARK: My
wife made these.

487
00:25:20,997 --> 00:25:22,216
Help yourself.
- Yeah?

488
00:25:22,346 --> 00:25:23,130
Yeah.

489
00:25:25,175 --> 00:25:25,915
Thanks.

490
00:25:31,486 --> 00:25:33,009
What are you going
to school for?

491
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,359
Criminal justice
and psychology.

492
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:36,622
PETER: Oh, yeah?

493
00:25:36,752 --> 00:25:37,797
- Yeah.- What's are you going to do?

494
00:25:37,927 --> 00:25:39,102
Save the world?

495
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:40,887
I don't know, maybe
one or two people.

496
00:25:41,017 --> 00:25:43,803
I mean, classes are free, so Itake a couple every semester.

497
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:44,934
GI Bill.

498
00:25:45,065 --> 00:25:46,936
You were in the army?

499
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:47,981
Yeah, I was in the Army.

500
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:48,982
Staff Sergeant.

501
00:25:49,112 --> 00:25:50,026
Special forces.

502
00:25:50,157 --> 00:25:51,506
I did two tours in Vietnam.

503
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:53,290
Really?

504
00:25:53,421 --> 00:25:55,249
Did you kill anybody?

505
00:25:55,379 --> 00:25:57,294
You look like you shouldbe in the mall or something.

506
00:25:57,425 --> 00:26:01,037
What are you doing in
here, rotting in jail?

507
00:26:01,168 --> 00:26:02,517
I killed a guy.

508
00:26:02,648 --> 00:26:03,431
[chuckle]

509
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,215
You killed somebody?

510
00:26:05,346 --> 00:26:07,348
What'd you do, one of
those assisted suicides?

511
00:26:07,478 --> 00:26:09,306
Tie the knot in a
rope or something?

512
00:26:09,437 --> 00:26:11,526
My friends and I pulled theswitch on the railroad tracks.

513
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:13,397
Derailed the train,
killed the engineer.

514
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:15,269
And what the fuck
were you thinking?

515
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:17,314
I wasn't really thinking.

516
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:19,186
You're a fuck up.

517
00:26:19,316 --> 00:26:20,404
I mean, tell me the truth.

518
00:26:20,535 --> 00:26:21,710
Why'd you do it?

519
00:26:21,841 --> 00:26:23,494
I mean, you had to
be mad at somebody.

520
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:26,585
- I wasn't mad at anybody.- No.

521
00:26:26,715 --> 00:26:28,891
You derail a train,
you kill some people,

522
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:30,806
you're mad at somebody.

523
00:26:30,937 --> 00:26:31,677
Fuck you.

524
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,034
Hey, man, what did
get on that exam?

525
00:26:41,164 --> 00:26:42,035
Come on, man.

526
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:43,384
What'd you get on the exam?

527
00:26:43,514 --> 00:26:45,342
- I got A, all right?
- I got an A too.

528
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:46,561
It was pretty easy.

529
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:47,606
Yeah.

530
00:26:47,736 --> 00:26:48,824
Most classes in here are easy.

531
00:26:48,955 --> 00:26:52,132
They're geared towards dummies.

532
00:26:52,262 --> 00:26:53,089
Hey.

533
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:53,960
Hey.

534
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,442
Stay away from that guy.

535
00:26:58,573 --> 00:26:59,443
- Who?
- Arthur?

536
00:26:59,574 --> 00:27:00,357
Yeah.

537
00:27:00,488 --> 00:27:01,532
Come on, man.

538
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:02,533
The guy doesn't
have any friends.

539
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:03,970
Besides, he's really smart.

540
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,798
Just may be a little dirty.

541
00:27:05,928 --> 00:27:10,498
Uh, he's smart,
and other stuff too.

542
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,978
Like what?

543
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:15,459
He killed his wholefamily, including the dog.

544
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,330
The dog.

545
00:27:20,595 --> 00:27:21,422
How could you hurt a dog?

546
00:27:26,993 --> 00:27:30,300
[rattling]

547
00:27:44,271 --> 00:27:46,534
Hey there.

548
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,448
Hey, relax.

549
00:27:47,578 --> 00:27:50,016
It's just me, Jones.

550
00:27:50,146 --> 00:27:51,626
Remember?
We met,

551
00:27:51,757 --> 00:27:52,583
Yeah, I remember.

552
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:54,585
What's going on?

553
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:56,762
Just thought I'd
come by and say hi.

554
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:58,633
How's everything going so far?

555
00:27:58,764 --> 00:28:00,940
Fine.

556
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,289
I'm kind of tired.

557
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:04,595
Can I go back to sleep,
if you don't mind?

558
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:07,511
I thought we
could talk a little.

559
00:28:07,642 --> 00:28:09,122
Get to know each other better.

560
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:10,950
Yeah, OK.

561
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,953
Can we do this tomorrow?

562
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:14,867
[smack]

563
00:28:14,997 --> 00:28:15,868
[shout]

564
00:28:15,998 --> 00:28:18,348
Daddy!

565
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:19,828
I guess you didn't hear me.

566
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:21,612
I want to talk now.

567
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:25,007
What do you want
to talk about?

568
00:28:25,138 --> 00:28:28,663
I thought we could
start with this.

569
00:28:28,794 --> 00:28:30,273
Fuck you, prick!

570
00:28:30,404 --> 00:28:33,537
[groans]

571
00:28:33,668 --> 00:28:35,017
I think you better reconsider.

572
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:36,410
[SOBBING] Fuck you.
[laughter]

573
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,367
Fuck you.

574
00:28:37,498 --> 00:28:40,631
Fuck you.

575
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:42,068
Fuck you.

576
00:28:42,198 --> 00:28:43,939
OFFICER JONES: I think
you better reconsider.

577
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,854
PETER: Fuck you!

578
00:28:45,985 --> 00:28:47,334

[chatter]

581
00:29:07,267 --> 00:29:08,616
OK!

582
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,704
Break it up!

583
00:29:09,835 --> 00:29:10,618
Break it up!

584
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,141
Hey, play basketball.

585
00:29:12,272 --> 00:29:14,056
Back off, back off.

586
00:29:25,198 --> 00:29:26,112
[music playing]

587
00:29:26,242 --> 00:29:28,418
[SINGING] Sex, money and guns.

588
00:29:31,987 --> 00:29:32,727
PETER: Hey.

589
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:33,728
Hey, baby.

590
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:36,818
I didn't think you'd come.

591
00:29:36,949 --> 00:29:38,167
I told you I'd be here.

592
00:29:38,298 --> 00:29:39,560
Yeah, I know, but still.

593
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:48,264
So, um, how are you doing?

594
00:29:51,746 --> 00:29:53,879
I'm-- I'm hanging in there.

595
00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:56,272
This place is scary.

596
00:29:56,403 --> 00:29:57,839
It's kind of creepy.

597
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:00,799
It's prison.

598
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:03,540
I don't know, but-- but Ithink things are going to be

599
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:06,935
really good for me, you know?

600
00:30:07,066 --> 00:30:08,023
I'm thinking about acting.

601
00:30:08,154 --> 00:30:08,937
Sh.

602
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:16,771
Hey, man.

603
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:17,990
What's up?

604
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,295
Peter, follow me for a minute.

605
00:30:19,426 --> 00:30:21,036
I want you to check
something out.

606
00:30:28,087 --> 00:30:28,827
What's up, man?

607
00:30:28,957 --> 00:30:30,480
Check this out.

608
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:32,787
Check this out.

609
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:33,744
What the hell is this?

610
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,834
Peach alcohol.

611
00:30:35,964 --> 00:30:37,444
Are you serious?

612
00:30:37,574 --> 00:30:42,188
Fresh peach juice, sugar,yeast, and let it ferment.

613
00:30:42,318 --> 00:30:43,102
Go ahead, drink up.

614
00:30:43,232 --> 00:30:43,972
Come on.

615
00:30:47,497 --> 00:30:48,281
Shit.

616
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,940
It'll get you wasted.

617
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,202
Or really sick too.

618
00:30:56,332 --> 00:30:57,116
Oh, that shit's terrible.

619
00:30:57,246 --> 00:30:58,030
I know.

620
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,900
Fuck.

621
00:31:01,598 --> 00:31:03,818
[grunt]

622
00:31:03,949 --> 00:31:05,951
Word is bond, man.

623
00:31:06,081 --> 00:31:09,998
I used to get so
high on the streets.

624
00:31:10,129 --> 00:31:11,086
Fuck, man!

625
00:31:11,217 --> 00:31:13,654
Two drugs--

626
00:31:13,784 --> 00:31:18,224
I think it's called Sebaand codeine, or something.

627
00:31:18,354 --> 00:31:21,357
And together, they
act like heroin.

628
00:31:21,488 --> 00:31:26,623
The whole thing is, the firsttime I tried, I was in heaven!

629
00:31:26,754 --> 00:31:28,234
Fuck, man.

630
00:31:28,364 --> 00:31:30,192
By the time I got lockedup, I was taking 10 by 10.

631
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:36,720
You know, I never gotthat same damn high again.

632
00:31:36,851 --> 00:31:38,461
Then I got sloppy on robberies.

633
00:31:38,592 --> 00:31:39,898
I had to get gas.

634
00:31:40,028 --> 00:31:43,162
Then one second I had a
gun in the guy's face.

635
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:46,034
I must've done 49,
50 armed robberies.

636
00:31:46,165 --> 00:31:47,340
And they got me on one.

637
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,124
Oh, man, I thought
you were innocent.

638
00:31:49,255 --> 00:31:51,561
I am innocent!

639
00:31:51,692 --> 00:31:55,174
The one armed robbery
they convicted me of.

640
00:31:55,304 --> 00:31:56,740
Now, the other 49--

641
00:31:56,871 --> 00:32:00,135
[laughter]

642
00:32:05,662 --> 00:32:07,490
Oh.

643
00:32:07,621 --> 00:32:09,405
Man, I feel--

644
00:32:09,536 --> 00:32:10,450
I feel fucking sick.

645
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,233
I feel like I'm going to puke.

646
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,543
[heaving]

647
00:32:16,673 --> 00:32:18,937

649
00:32:25,595 --> 00:32:27,684
Mm.

650
00:32:27,815 --> 00:32:28,859
Jones is here.

651
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:34,082
What the fuck?

652
00:32:39,566 --> 00:32:42,786
You still have access tothe visiting room supplies?

653
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:45,833
Yeah, why?

654
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,096
I have an idea.

655
00:32:48,227 --> 00:32:49,054
Uh!

656
00:32:49,184 --> 00:32:50,316
What's up now, baby.

657
00:32:50,446 --> 00:32:52,448
How you like that?

658
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:53,493
Come on.

659
00:32:53,623 --> 00:32:54,363
Hey, where are you going?

660
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,420
OFFICER JONES: Yeah.

661
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,426
You ready?

662
00:33:13,556 --> 00:33:14,601
Yeah.

663
00:33:14,731 --> 00:33:15,471
Yeah, I'm ready.

664
00:33:18,518 --> 00:33:19,214
Are you ready?

665
00:33:30,269 --> 00:33:31,052
Now you're talking.

666
00:33:36,449 --> 00:33:37,189
Take off your shirt.

667
00:33:44,326 --> 00:33:46,372
You fuck with me
and you're dead.

668
00:33:46,502 --> 00:33:47,199
Take off your pants.

669
00:33:56,686 --> 00:33:58,427
F-- f-- f-- fuck,

00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,344
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

672
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,872
I'll kill you!

673
00:34:09,003 --> 00:34:09,873
Up yours, Jones.

[continued shouting]

677
00:34:22,843 --> 00:34:26,020
Hey, Jones, don't you haveother things to worry about?

678
00:34:26,151 --> 00:34:27,630
What the hell are
you talking about?

679
00:34:27,761 --> 00:34:28,544
Look.

680
00:34:36,422 --> 00:34:39,251
[groans]

681
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:42,428
If you ever come
anywhere near me again

682
00:34:42,558 --> 00:34:45,431
or if you ever say anythingabout this to anyone,

683
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:47,346
that picture is going toend up on the warden's desk.

684
00:34:47,476 --> 00:34:48,825
You got it?

685
00:34:48,956 --> 00:34:51,524
You got it?

686
00:34:51,654 --> 00:34:52,960

689
00:35:04,276 --> 00:35:05,668
Hey.

690
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:06,582
How's it going?

691
00:35:06,713 --> 00:35:07,540
Come on in.

692
00:35:28,213 --> 00:35:28,952
Interesting collage.

693
00:35:32,608 --> 00:35:33,305
Who's this lady?

694
00:35:37,004 --> 00:35:37,787
My mother.

695
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:41,487
I know what you mean.

696
00:35:44,446 --> 00:35:47,754
So you gonna turn Jones in?

697
00:35:47,884 --> 00:35:48,624
Nah.

698
00:35:48,755 --> 00:35:50,974
I'm not a rat.

699
00:35:51,105 --> 00:35:53,412
Are you obsessed with
family pictures or what?

700
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:54,239
Not my family.

701
00:35:58,547 --> 00:36:01,898
I'd like to see Jones
behind these bars.

702
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:02,856
Yeah.

703
00:36:02,986 --> 00:36:04,597
What are you going to do?

704
00:36:04,727 --> 00:36:06,164
Life's unfair.

705
00:36:06,294 --> 00:36:08,253
You should keep an eye on him.

706
00:36:08,383 --> 00:36:09,123
Yeah, I will.

707
00:36:12,605 --> 00:36:15,042
How come there's no petswith any of these families?

708
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,391
Scared to ask, huh?

709
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:21,309
I killed the dog first.

710
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,442
My father loved that dog.

711
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,796
[footsteps]

712
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:31,276
Next.

713
00:36:31,406 --> 00:36:32,973
Yes, my name's Leslie Sweeton.

714
00:36:33,103 --> 00:36:34,540
I'm here to see Peter Madagin.

715
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:37,543
What's his number?

716
00:36:37,673 --> 00:36:39,806
96534.

717
00:36:39,936 --> 00:36:40,720
And just sign right here.

718
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:55,038
Step over there.

719
00:37:02,176 --> 00:37:03,525
Hey, how you doing?

720
00:37:17,147 --> 00:37:19,498
[phone ringing]

721
00:37:19,628 --> 00:37:20,325
Yeah?

722
00:37:23,632 --> 00:37:24,720
You got a visitor.

723
00:37:24,851 --> 00:37:26,592
Who's coming?

724
00:37:26,722 --> 00:37:28,724
It's this old friend
of mine named Leslie.

725
00:37:28,855 --> 00:37:29,638
Old friend.

726
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:30,552
That smile?

727
00:37:30,683 --> 00:37:31,553
Girlfriend.

728
00:37:31,684 --> 00:37:33,338
I don't know.

729
00:37:33,468 --> 00:37:34,730
I'd like to say girlfriend, butI don't think that's the case.

730
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:36,515
Yeah?

731
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:37,429
Maybe I'll just have to sneakdown there and take a peek.

732
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:39,082
I told her all about you.

733
00:37:39,213 --> 00:37:40,170
She says I do more homeworkhere than I did at school.

734
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:41,041
Yeah?

735
00:37:41,171 --> 00:37:41,955
Where's my term paper.

736
00:37:42,085 --> 00:37:43,086
Hey, relax.

737
00:37:43,217 --> 00:37:45,872
It's almost done.

738
00:37:46,002 --> 00:37:48,614
Smile.

739
00:37:48,744 --> 00:37:52,095
[buzzing]

740
00:37:58,711 --> 00:38:00,582
Hey.

741
00:38:00,713 --> 00:38:02,497
You look beautiful.

742
00:38:02,628 --> 00:38:05,674
Don't try and be
sweet with me now.

743
00:38:05,805 --> 00:38:06,806
Let me ask you something.

744
00:38:06,936 --> 00:38:09,417
Don't you like me?

745
00:38:09,548 --> 00:38:10,592
Of course I like you.

746
00:38:10,723 --> 00:38:12,028
Why would you ask me that?

747
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:15,771
Because you seem to be
so good at hurting me.

748
00:38:15,902 --> 00:38:19,340
I just thought you must hate me.

749
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:21,560
What are you talking about?

750
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,823
I saw who else wascoming here to visit you.

751
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,784
Oh, do you mean Donna?

752
00:38:28,915 --> 00:38:29,872
What?

753
00:38:30,003 --> 00:38:31,657
She doesn't mean anything to me.

754
00:38:31,787 --> 00:38:33,528
But she means something to me.

755
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:35,574
You know, I wasn't evensure that you liked girls.

756
00:38:35,704 --> 00:38:36,618
Whoa!

757
00:38:36,749 --> 00:38:38,054
What is your fucking problem?

758
00:38:38,185 --> 00:38:42,668
All this is because some
bimbo came to visit me?

759
00:38:42,798 --> 00:38:45,714
You're just as screwed
up as your father.

760
00:38:45,845 --> 00:38:49,152
You have no right
to bad mouth him.

761
00:38:49,283 --> 00:38:51,807
Oh, Peter.

762
00:38:51,938 --> 00:38:54,375
I am so sorry.

763
00:38:54,506 --> 00:38:55,681
I have to go.

764
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:58,205
Well-- And I am not
some fucking homo!

765
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,816
I like women!

766
00:39:00,947 --> 00:39:02,992
I'm sure.

767
00:39:03,123 --> 00:39:05,081
Just not me.

768
00:39:05,212 --> 00:39:06,605
I don't never want
to see you again.

769
00:39:09,695 --> 00:39:10,783
Well, that's fine.

770
00:39:10,913 --> 00:39:12,219
That's fine with me.
You know what?

771
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,351
Get the fuck out of here!

772
00:39:13,481 --> 00:39:16,789
[door closing]

773
00:39:25,972 --> 00:39:26,712
Fuck.

774
00:40:01,616 --> 00:40:04,924
[chatter]

775
00:40:16,544 --> 00:40:19,634
The little white boy's short.

776
00:40:19,765 --> 00:40:22,507
Five days and a wake up tillI get to the halfway house.

777
00:40:22,637 --> 00:40:23,856
You figure out what
you gonna do to fuck

778
00:40:23,986 --> 00:40:25,379
up when you get over there?

779
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,599
Hey, man, I'm just gonnaget some decent clothes.

780
00:40:27,729 --> 00:40:29,035
And to hook up with a babe.

781
00:40:29,165 --> 00:40:30,645
At least you got your
priorities straight.

782
00:40:30,776 --> 00:40:32,386
I wouldn't want to see yougo down the wrong track.

783
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:33,779
Yeah, you know how I do.

784
00:40:33,909 --> 00:40:34,867
I'll be aight.

785
00:40:34,997 --> 00:40:37,260
Word is bond.

786
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:38,218
Heh.

787
00:40:38,348 --> 00:40:39,262
OK, Raheem.

788
00:40:39,393 --> 00:40:41,047
Listen.

789
00:40:41,177 --> 00:40:43,049
You've been here for a while, soyou done seen a lot of things.

790
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:45,747
That should give you
depth and patience.

791
00:40:45,878 --> 00:40:49,142
So from now on, before
you move, think.

792
00:40:49,272 --> 00:40:51,144
All right?

793
00:40:51,274 --> 00:40:52,232
Yeah.

794
00:40:52,362 --> 00:40:54,060
I hear you, homie.

795
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,322
And you can trust me--

796
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,585
you don't think
before you act, you're

797
00:40:57,716 --> 00:40:58,543
gonna be back here with me.

798
00:41:11,512 --> 00:41:12,382
COUNSELOR: All right.

799
00:41:12,513 --> 00:41:13,688
This is where you'll sleep.

800
00:41:13,819 --> 00:41:15,081
Ricky, what's up?
- Hey.

801
00:41:15,211 --> 00:41:16,822
Ricky this is Peter,
Peter this is Ricky.

802
00:41:16,952 --> 00:41:17,692
- What's up?
- Hey.

803
00:41:17,823 --> 00:41:18,345
Good to meet you, man.

804
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,346
All right.

805
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,782
Now, curfew's at 8 o'clock.

806
00:41:20,913 --> 00:41:23,045
And we also have urine
monitoring once a week.

807
00:41:23,176 --> 00:41:26,179
So if it comes back
dirty, you go back.

808
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:28,398
You know, miss curfew
and you go back.

809
00:41:28,529 --> 00:41:29,748
PETER: OK.

810
00:41:29,878 --> 00:41:31,532
Be anywhere else
other than were you tell

811
00:41:31,663 --> 00:41:33,621
us you're going to be, and--

812
00:41:33,752 --> 00:41:35,101
- You go back.
- All right.

813
00:41:35,231 --> 00:41:36,755
Got it so far?
PETER: Got it.

814
00:41:36,885 --> 00:41:38,408
All right.

815
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:39,627
Now, you're required to goto AA meetings once a week.

816
00:41:39,758 --> 00:41:40,585
OK.

817
00:41:40,715 --> 00:41:41,803
I think that's about it.

818
00:41:41,934 --> 00:41:43,588
Any questions so far?
- Uh, yeah.

819
00:41:43,718 --> 00:41:45,590
Do you know where I can get someclothes? 'Cause this is-- this

820
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,852
is all I have.
[chuckle]

821
00:41:46,982 --> 00:41:48,331
Yeah.

822
00:41:48,462 --> 00:41:49,594
I can give you a pass
to go shopping downtown.

823
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:50,682
Great.
COUNSELOR: All right.

824
00:41:50,812 --> 00:41:51,813
Rick, be cool.

825
00:41:51,944 --> 00:41:52,814
All right, man.

826
00:41:52,945 --> 00:41:53,598
COUNSELOR: Y'all take care.

827
00:41:53,728 --> 00:41:54,860
Thank you.

828
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:55,991
Hey, that's all you.

829
00:41:56,122 --> 00:41:57,166
Have fun.
- All right.

830
00:41:57,297 --> 00:41:58,080
Thanks.

831
00:42:03,782 --> 00:42:04,957
COUNSELOR: Pete.

832
00:42:05,087 --> 00:42:06,175
Urine tonight.

833
00:42:06,306 --> 00:42:07,525
I'm in what?

834
00:42:07,655 --> 00:42:08,874
No, fool.

835
00:42:09,004 --> 00:42:10,658
Urine sample time.

836
00:42:10,789 --> 00:42:13,182
I need you to go in this cup.

837
00:42:13,313 --> 00:42:14,140
Let me know when you're ready.

838
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,750
I got to watch you.

839
00:42:15,881 --> 00:42:17,012
Yeah.

840
00:42:17,143 --> 00:42:18,361
Can you just give me a minute?

841
00:42:18,492 --> 00:42:19,275
Whenever.

842
00:42:19,406 --> 00:42:20,146
Just let me know.

843
00:42:24,193 --> 00:42:25,194
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

844
00:42:25,325 --> 00:42:26,108
What's going on?

845
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:26,979
PETER: Not much.

846
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:28,546
What's up?

847
00:42:28,676 --> 00:42:29,808
Are you clean?

848
00:42:29,938 --> 00:42:32,550
PETER: What do you mean?

849
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,856
Is your urine clean?

850
00:42:34,987 --> 00:42:36,162
Yeah.

851
00:42:36,292 --> 00:42:39,165
I haven't done anything
in about a year.

852
00:42:39,295 --> 00:42:40,558
Can you go for me?

853
00:42:40,688 --> 00:42:41,428
What?

854
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,342
How?

855
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:49,349
Just fill this up, and
put it under the sink.

856
00:42:49,479 --> 00:42:51,699
OK?

857
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,658
Yeah, OK.

858
00:42:53,788 --> 00:42:54,963
Don't get me busted, though.

859
00:42:55,094 --> 00:42:56,225
No problem.

860
00:42:56,356 --> 00:42:57,139
Don't worry.

861
00:43:20,728 --> 00:43:21,773
What a fucking farce.

862
00:43:21,903 --> 00:43:23,644
I'm the only clean one here?

863
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,254
You are clean, right?

864
00:43:25,385 --> 00:43:26,212
Yeah, man.

865
00:43:26,342 --> 00:43:27,126
Don't worry about it.

866
00:43:27,256 --> 00:43:28,040
Jesus Christ.

867
00:43:30,433 --> 00:43:32,000
Could you just let me knowwhen you're done so I can

868
00:43:32,131 --> 00:43:34,307
let the counselor watch me go?

869
00:43:34,437 --> 00:43:37,353
Don't move it so fast.

870
00:43:37,484 --> 00:43:38,746
Hold on.

871
00:43:38,877 --> 00:43:41,009
Oh, man.

872
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,054
OK.

873
00:43:42,184 --> 00:43:44,752
Passes for the weekend.

874
00:43:44,883 --> 00:43:47,929
Ricky Gomez-- three day pass.

875
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,192
Don't forget to call in.

876
00:43:50,323 --> 00:43:54,283
Peter Madagin-- his
first one day pass.

877
00:43:54,414 --> 00:43:55,241
Peter, stay and I'll explain.

878
00:43:55,371 --> 00:43:56,198
All right.

879
00:43:56,329 --> 00:43:57,547
Any more questions?

880
00:43:57,678 --> 00:43:58,636
All right, we're done here.

881
00:44:06,034 --> 00:44:07,601
OK, Peter.

882
00:44:07,732 --> 00:44:09,864
You have to call in everyhour, starting with two hours

883
00:44:09,995 --> 00:44:12,345
after you leave, and
ending with two hours

884
00:44:12,475 --> 00:44:14,739
before you're due back.
Got it?

885
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:15,653
Yeah.

886
00:44:15,783 --> 00:44:16,566
Got it.

887
00:44:16,697 --> 00:44:17,785
Don't screw up, son.

888
00:44:17,916 --> 00:44:18,656
OK.

889
00:44:28,274 --> 00:44:31,581
[doorbell ringing]

890
00:44:39,372 --> 00:44:40,939
Hi, Leslie.

891
00:44:41,069 --> 00:44:41,983
Hi.

892
00:44:42,114 --> 00:44:42,941
Can I come in?

893
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,380
Yeah.

894
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,300
Oh.

895
00:44:57,956 --> 00:45:00,480
Sorry, I'm interrupting.

896
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:02,874
Well, I, uh-- I just wantedto come and say hello.

897
00:45:03,004 --> 00:45:03,701
I can't stay.

898
00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:12,187
God.

899
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:14,102
Man, I can't believe
you're out already.

900
00:45:14,233 --> 00:45:15,495
Bro, you'll be out soon too. .

901
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:17,192
Just a few months in a
halfway house is all.

902
00:45:17,323 --> 00:45:18,628
[sigh]

903
00:45:18,759 --> 00:45:20,543
Yeah, still.

904
00:45:20,674 --> 00:45:21,675
You hear anything about John?

905
00:45:21,806 --> 00:45:22,676
Nah, man.

906
00:45:22,807 --> 00:45:24,069
He went somewhere else too.

907
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:27,072
I think he's still in there.

908
00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:29,030
Yo, wanna took a ride with me?

909
00:45:31,598 --> 00:45:32,381
Yeah, sure.

910
00:45:32,512 --> 00:45:33,252
Come on.

911
00:45:38,474 --> 00:45:39,171
Just wait here a second.

912
00:45:58,973 --> 00:45:59,757
Party time, dude.

913
00:46:03,021 --> 00:46:04,936
It's tempting, but I can't.

914
00:46:05,066 --> 00:46:06,502
I have drug tests.

915
00:46:06,633 --> 00:46:08,591
So do I, with
my parole officer.

916
00:46:08,722 --> 00:46:11,638
You can beat it, though.

917
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,945
Nah, that's all right.

918
00:46:14,075 --> 00:46:15,773
My urine's a rare
commodity these days.

919
00:46:23,606 --> 00:46:25,783
Hey, man, what time is it?

920
00:46:25,913 --> 00:46:26,653
It's, uh, 4:00.

921
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:27,785
Why?

922
00:46:27,915 --> 00:46:29,134
Shit!

Shit!

924
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:33,486
I'm supposed to callhim, like, two hours ago.

925
00:46:33,616 --> 00:46:34,617
Dude, can I use your phone?
- Yeah.

926
00:46:34,748 --> 00:46:35,140
Yeah, sure.
Go ahead.

927
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:35,967
Fuck.

928
00:46:47,021 --> 00:46:49,371
What the hell is
going on with you?

929
00:46:49,502 --> 00:46:51,896
Your first day out andyou're fucking up already.

930
00:46:52,026 --> 00:46:54,681
You look like shit,
and you reek like beer.

931
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,378
Yeah, well, I
was at this party,

932
00:46:56,509 --> 00:46:59,729
and then, you know, somebodyspilled beer on me, and, uh--

933
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:00,774
All right.

934
00:47:00,905 --> 00:47:01,819
Just go.

935
00:47:01,949 --> 00:47:03,298
Just go get yourself cleaned up.

936
00:47:11,393 --> 00:47:12,351
What's going on?

937
00:47:12,481 --> 00:47:14,048
You're going back, Peter.

938
00:47:14,179 --> 00:47:15,789
It's clear you're
not ready for this.

939
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,573
What?

940
00:47:17,704 --> 00:47:18,531
Just because I called in late,you're going to send me back?

941
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:20,533
Peter, I have no choice.

942
00:47:23,536 --> 00:47:24,406

What happened?

946
00:48:27,556 --> 00:48:29,907
It doesn't matter, does it?

947
00:48:30,037 --> 00:48:30,820
Maybe not.

948
00:48:30,951 --> 00:48:32,779
You OK?

949
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:36,391
I don't want to
be here anymore.

950
00:48:36,522 --> 00:48:38,089
I don't deserve this.

951
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:39,525
I didn't mean to kill anyone.

952
00:48:45,835 --> 00:48:48,447
OFFICER CLARK: Look.

953
00:48:48,577 --> 00:48:53,017
The right path doesn't
have to be the hardest.

954
00:48:53,147 --> 00:48:54,714
And that's definitely
true in this case.

955
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:02,330
OK.

956
00:49:02,461 --> 00:49:03,505
You hang in there.

She doesn't love me.

961
00:49:34,493 --> 00:49:38,062
She doesn't even want
to be with me anymore.

962
00:49:38,192 --> 00:49:40,673
I never wanted you.

963
00:49:40,803 --> 00:49:41,848
I wish you were never born.

964
00:49:56,297 --> 00:49:59,518

I promise you this.

984

Sweetie, give mommy

00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,371
He was really sick, though.

1101
00:59:09,502 --> 00:59:10,547
I wonder what's the
matter with him.

1102
00:59:16,944 --> 00:59:18,163
I think we might
have an overdose.

1103
00:59:50,674 --> 00:59:54,025
[chuckle]

1104
00:59:56,157 --> 00:59:58,116
[train horn]

1105
00:59:58,246 --> 00:59:59,030
No!

1106
01:00:02,163 --> 01:00:03,512
Still a mama's boy.

1107
01:00:08,648 --> 01:00:10,476
You're still a
little mama's boy.

1108
01:00:25,534 --> 01:00:28,929
[screams]

1109
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:32,411
[heavy breathing]

1110
01:00:48,601 --> 01:00:51,473
OFFICER: Visits--
Rockman, Clark,

1111
01:00:51,604 --> 01:00:54,302
Stevens, Weiss, and Smith.

1112
01:01:06,706 --> 01:01:08,055
Do you have a
visit for Madagin?

1113
01:01:14,627 --> 01:01:15,410
No.

1114
01:01:15,541 --> 01:01:17,151
Doesn't look like it.

1115
01:01:17,282 --> 01:01:19,980
Well, could
there be a mistake?

1116
01:01:20,111 --> 01:01:23,462
[sigh]

1117
01:01:25,638 --> 01:01:26,421
Hey, John.

1118
01:01:26,552 --> 01:01:27,292
How you doing?

1119
01:01:27,422 --> 01:01:28,728
This is Smitty.

1120
01:01:28,859 --> 01:01:31,731
Do you have anyone there
waiting to see Madagin?

1121
01:01:31,862 --> 01:01:33,951
Yeah, I got the list.

1122
01:01:34,081 --> 01:01:34,821
Sorry, but no Madagin.

1123
01:01:48,313 --> 01:01:50,358
Warden wants to see you.

1124
01:01:50,489 --> 01:01:52,186
What for?

1125
01:01:52,317 --> 01:01:53,361
I don't know.

1126
01:01:53,492 --> 01:01:54,798
And neither do you.

1127
01:01:54,928 --> 01:01:55,668
Got it?

1128
01:01:58,192 --> 01:02:01,456
If you say one
word, I will kill you.

1129
01:02:07,462 --> 01:02:08,202
I don't know anything.

1130
01:02:11,379 --> 01:02:12,467
Madagin.

1131
01:02:12,598 --> 01:02:15,122
I assume you know
why you're here.

1132
01:02:15,253 --> 01:02:16,297
No.

1133
01:02:16,428 --> 01:02:17,559
I don't know, sir.

1134
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:19,039
You don't know?

1135
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:19,997
Well, let me tell you.

1136
01:02:20,127 --> 01:02:22,390
This is yours, right?

1137
01:02:22,521 --> 01:02:23,478
I don't know.

1138
01:02:23,609 --> 01:02:25,611
You don't know?

1139
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,439
You didn't bring with youfrom the halfway house

1140
01:02:27,569 --> 01:02:30,877
a bottle of eye drops?
Culp?

1141
01:02:31,008 --> 01:02:32,574
OFFICER: Shows up on his
intake inventory sheet.

1142
01:02:32,705 --> 01:02:33,662
One bottle of eye drops.

1143
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:35,403
Yeah, I did.
That's right.

1144
01:02:35,534 --> 01:02:37,231
But I used it up
and I threw it away.

1145
01:02:37,362 --> 01:02:38,798
Yeah?

1146
01:02:38,929 --> 01:02:40,060
Then how the hell didthis end up full of drugs

1147
01:02:40,191 --> 01:02:42,193
and stuck in your friend's arm?

1148
01:02:42,323 --> 01:02:43,411
I don't know.

1149
01:02:43,542 --> 01:02:45,239
I-- I threw it away.

1150
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:46,588
That's the last I saw it.

1151
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:47,807
WARDEN: Look, Madagin,
I know you're not

1152
01:02:47,938 --> 01:02:50,244
responsible for
Ritton's death, but I do

1153
01:02:50,375 --> 01:02:52,377
suspect that you know who is.

1154
01:02:52,507 --> 01:02:54,945
He's been seen many times withRitton and his little crew.

1155
01:02:55,075 --> 01:02:56,207
What are you talking about?

1156
01:02:56,337 --> 01:02:57,469
Mark's not dead.
WARDEN: Oh, yes he is.

1157
01:02:57,599 --> 01:02:59,036
He's dead.

1158
01:02:59,166 --> 01:03:00,254
He was dead before thedoctors could get to him.

1159
01:03:00,385 --> 01:03:02,126
Bad drugs or something,
I don't know.

1160
01:03:02,256 --> 01:03:04,432
But I suspect you do.

1161
01:03:04,563 --> 01:03:06,130
Now I want to know the names.

1162
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:07,348
I want to know the people thatare involved with bringing

1163
01:03:07,479 --> 01:03:08,219
these drugs in here.

1164
01:03:08,349 --> 01:03:09,698
[sigh]

1165
01:03:09,829 --> 01:03:10,699
No, wait a second.

1166
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:12,745
Before you say anything--

1167
01:03:12,876 --> 01:03:14,703
of course I know that you'regoing up for the parole board

1168
01:03:14,834 --> 01:03:15,574
in a couple of days.

1169
01:03:15,704 --> 01:03:17,097
Right?

1170
01:03:17,228 --> 01:03:20,666
So why don't you let me bea friend to you in this.

1171
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:23,408
You tell me what I want toknow, and I tell them a guy

1172
01:03:23,538 --> 01:03:25,149
like you doesn't belong
in a place like this.

1173
01:03:25,279 --> 01:03:26,498
What do you say?

1174
01:03:26,628 --> 01:03:28,413
If I say anything,
I'm as good as dead.

1175
01:03:28,543 --> 01:03:30,110
WARDEN: And if you
don't say anything,

1176
01:03:30,241 --> 01:03:32,286
there's a mark against youin front of the parole board.

1177
01:03:32,417 --> 01:03:34,811
Look, I don't know anything.

1178
01:03:34,941 --> 01:03:36,029
I don't know anything.

1179
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,291
I'm not a drug
dealer, and I don't

1180
01:03:37,422 --> 01:03:38,815
know anything about heroin.

1181
01:03:38,945 --> 01:03:40,033
Heroin?

1182
01:03:40,164 --> 01:03:41,469
You know it was heroin?

1183
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,819
I just guessed.

1184
01:03:42,949 --> 01:03:44,385
WARDEN: You guessed?

1185
01:03:44,516 --> 01:03:45,865
Well, you guessed right.

1186
01:03:45,996 --> 01:03:47,084
Heroin in my jail--

1187
01:03:47,214 --> 01:03:49,651
I can't have it.

1188
01:03:49,782 --> 01:03:53,090
So I guess this is your dayof reckoning, Mr. Madagin.

1189
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:55,309
And what's it gonna be?

1190
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,354
Mark was my friend.

1191
01:04:00,793 --> 01:04:03,056
I wanna help you guys,
but I don't think

1192
01:04:03,187 --> 01:04:04,275
I'll make it out alive if I do.

1193
01:04:08,061 --> 01:04:10,803
OFFICER: Should I
take him to solitary?

1194
01:04:10,934 --> 01:04:12,326
No.

1195
01:04:12,457 --> 01:04:13,632
Think he's likely to tellus what we want to know?

1196
01:04:43,531 --> 01:04:45,577
Hey, Jones.

1197
01:04:45,707 --> 01:04:46,926
Jones, wait up.

1198
01:04:50,234 --> 01:04:51,800
I need to talk to
you for a minute.

1199
01:04:51,931 --> 01:04:54,629
I'm in trouble.
I need your help.

1200
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,762
Talk to someone who cares.

1201
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:57,850
Do you want your picture back?

1202
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:05,684
Go ahead.

1203
01:05:05,814 --> 01:05:06,598
I'm listening.

1204
01:05:14,693 --> 01:05:18,001
[chatter]

1205
01:05:49,684 --> 01:05:50,729
OFFICER CLARK: How's it going?

1206
01:05:50,859 --> 01:05:52,644
Did you hear about Mark?

1207
01:05:52,774 --> 01:05:53,906
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.

1208
01:05:54,037 --> 01:05:55,081
Are you OK?

1209
01:05:55,212 --> 01:05:55,995
No.

1210
01:05:56,126 --> 01:05:57,257
Not really.

1211
01:05:57,388 --> 01:05:58,650
So what you gonna do?

1212
01:05:58,780 --> 01:05:59,825
I think I've already done it.

1213
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,958
The question is,
will I survive it?

1214
01:06:02,088 --> 01:06:06,136
You know, life's
painful sometimes.

1215
01:06:06,266 --> 01:06:09,487
When does it get to thepart where it's not painful?

1216
01:06:09,617 --> 01:06:11,271
Do you need help
with your homework?

1217
01:06:11,402 --> 01:06:12,751
Nah.

1218
01:06:12,881 --> 01:06:14,231
You know, I think it's
time I start learning

1219
01:06:14,361 --> 01:06:16,189
how to do this stuff myself.

1220
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,626
Sometimes you gotta
stop making excuses,

1221
01:06:18,757 --> 01:06:21,281
you know-- blaming
stuff on everybody.

1222
01:06:21,412 --> 01:06:23,718
It's time for me.

1223
01:06:23,849 --> 01:06:27,505
[lighter flicking]

1224
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:50,789
OFFICER: Back up.

1225
01:06:50,919 --> 01:06:54,227
Don't try no crazy shit.

1226
01:06:54,358 --> 01:06:56,229
Back the fuck up!
Get the fuck back!

1227
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:01,974
Go back to your cell.

1228
01:07:02,105 --> 01:07:03,149
Get in your cell.

1229
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:23,430
People keep asking me whenyou're going to come home.

1230
01:07:23,561 --> 01:07:25,476
What should I tell them?

1231
01:07:25,606 --> 01:07:27,478
I don't know.

1232
01:07:27,608 --> 01:07:29,132
I'll know soon, though.

1233
01:07:29,262 --> 01:07:32,439
I'm going in front of theparole board this week, so--

1234
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:33,440
What do you think will happen?

1235
01:07:36,965 --> 01:07:39,229
I'm not sure.

1236
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:40,273
But I'm ready to go.

1237
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:47,889
I'm sure they'll let you out.

1238
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:50,283
You've been in this placelong enough already.

1239
01:07:50,414 --> 01:07:51,763
Yeah.

1240
01:07:51,893 --> 01:07:55,245
I just hope they think so.

1241
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:58,639
[buzzing]

1242
01:07:59,727 --> 01:08:00,554
Time's up.

1243
01:08:04,123 --> 01:08:09,041
"And toad went
back to toad hall.

1244
01:08:09,172 --> 01:08:11,522
The end."

1245
01:08:11,652 --> 01:08:13,263
Now it's time for you
to go to bed, young man.

1246
01:08:13,393 --> 01:08:14,612
Can you sing, mommy?

1247
01:08:14,742 --> 01:08:15,482
Oh.

1248
01:08:15,613 --> 01:08:17,397
[chuckle]

1249
01:08:17,528 --> 01:08:19,312
OK, just a few more
minutes, all right?

1250
01:08:19,443 --> 01:08:20,226
OK.

1251
01:08:20,357 --> 01:08:21,488
All right, sweetheart?

1252
01:08:24,491 --> 01:08:28,843
[SINGING] Hush little
baby, don't say a word.

1253
01:08:28,974 --> 01:08:31,716
Mama's gonna buy
you a mocking bird.

1254
01:08:31,846 --> 01:08:32,630
PETER: Time's up, mom.

1255
01:08:37,069 --> 01:08:38,636
Oh.

1256
01:08:38,766 --> 01:08:40,899
Well, can't you stay
just another minute?

1257
01:08:41,029 --> 01:08:41,943
No, I can't.

1258
01:08:42,074 --> 01:08:44,337
I really gotta go.

1259
01:08:44,468 --> 01:08:47,210
I just wanted to
say something to you.

1260
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:49,777
What?
What's the matter?

1261
01:08:49,908 --> 01:08:53,216
I just want to
tell you that I--

1262
01:08:59,222 --> 01:09:00,092
It's OK.

1263
01:09:00,223 --> 01:09:01,006
You go.

1264
01:09:04,052 --> 01:09:07,012
I'll tell you some other time.

1265
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:07,969
You just go.

1266
01:09:11,016 --> 01:09:13,801
It's OK, mom.

1267
01:09:13,932 --> 01:09:15,063
It's OK.
I know.

1268
01:09:15,194 --> 01:09:16,108
Yeah.

1269
01:09:16,239 --> 01:09:19,546
[sobbing]

1270
01:09:23,681 --> 01:09:25,161
I know.

1271
01:09:25,291 --> 01:09:26,031
I know.

1272
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:33,517
[chatter]

1273
01:10:19,606 --> 01:10:20,868
You're dead, Madagin.

1274
01:10:23,871 --> 01:10:25,046
You fucked me.

1275
01:10:25,177 --> 01:10:26,744
- No I didn't.
- You fucked me!

1276
01:10:26,874 --> 01:10:27,614
No, I didn't!

1277
01:10:27,745 --> 01:10:28,572
Just wait!

Obviously, I hope
you'll let me go home.

And I've made some
mistakes recently.

I see every mistake
that I've ever made

1303
01:12:29,127 --> 01:12:33,174
and I know exactly
why I made them.

1304
01:12:33,305 --> 01:12:35,394
And maybe now I can get outthere and not repeat them.

1305

But I know why I
was on those tracks.

1306
