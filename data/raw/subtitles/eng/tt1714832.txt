00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,373
' Story of our journey
from a 2-wheeler scooter...

3
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,034
...to a 4-wheeler car.'

'By us, l mean the Duggal family.'

son Duggal...

'Our car-buying story starts...

8
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,581
... on the day Papa
received an income-tax refund.'

' To celebrate, Mummy was
going to cook chicken for dinner.'

10

' lt was a mere refund,
of our own income...

11

And yet everybody
was celebrating...

12
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:19,057
...as if we had got a huge bonus.'

13
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:23,396
'That month, the
Duggal family had Rs 7,600

'This is how our family
normally holds discussions.'

17
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:33,935
We're not going to buy
a dish TV or a fridge.

18
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,537
We're going to buy an iPod.

19
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:37,013
lt costs Rs.9,000.

20
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,418
What makes you so
knowledgeable about it?

21
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:40,946
Have you ever bought one?

22
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,081
l haven't bought an
lPL team either...

23
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:44,616
But l do know that Shah Rukh Khan...

24
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,624
...has paid Rs.4 billion
for the Knight Riders.

25
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,954
Shut up.
- You shut up.

26
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,085
You shut up.

27
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:52,824
We'll sell this cupboard, and
get a new fridge. That's it.

28
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,434
lt's in excellent condition.
Even makes the right sounds.

29
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:56,294
Papa, Dish..

30
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:57,697
Makes a racket all night.

31
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,032
Doesn't let me sleep.

32

Plug your ears with cotton.
- Whatever!

33
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:04,437
That's why l say, papa..

No. iPod, iPod, iPod...
we're going to buy an iPod.

36
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:11,841
What are you guys up to?!

37
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,118
Stop this ruckus!

38
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,115
Deepu, you idiot!

39
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,923
You'll finish all the hot water.

'We hadn't even decided how
to spend the refund money...

41

phone started ringing.'

00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,796
'Phones! The root of all problems.'

Hello, Santosh Duggal this side.

45
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,605
Urmi. How are you?

46
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,139
How come, so early...

47
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:46,013
'Urmi. Papa's one
and only real sister.'

48
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,812
'We call her Phupho (Aunt).'

49
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,490
' Phupho lives in Meerut with
her husband's joint family.'

50
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:55,617
'She called to give us
some explosive news.'

51
00:04:55,862 --> 00:05:00,094
Okay. Fine.

52
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,511
Urmi's youngest
sister-in-law is getting married.

53
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,105
On Saturday.

54
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:21,117
Phupho's husband's
youngest sister's wedding...

55
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,914
...so its compulsory
for all of us to attend.

56
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:24,756
Everyone...

57
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,516
...Forget about
dish TV, iPod, fridge.

58
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:30,121
Money comes as refund...

59
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,129
...money goes as wedding expenses!

60
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,533
At least we won't have
to fight any more...

61
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:35,726
...about how to
spend the refund money.

62
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,530
The refund won't be enough...

63
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,535
... l'll have to withdraw
from the provident fund as well.

64
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,663
You deal with that...

65
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,000
Chicken cancelled!

66
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:45,600
You'll get squash and
okra for dinner. That's it!

67
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:46,870
No!!!!

68
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,071
Okra and roti.

69
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:51,613
Not for me.
- Jam sandwich for you.

70
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,014
You're spoiling him.
Bye, Mummy..

71
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,553
How will l spoil him
with jam sandwich?

72
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,555
The potatoes were not
properly cooked yesterday.

73
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,548
Starting tomorrow,
cook for yourself!

74
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,754
Potatoes were not
properly cooked, So be it.

75
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,969
Good morning, Mr. Farooqi.
- Good morning, good morning.

76
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,983
2,1 ... 2,2... 2,3...

77
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:31,317
'Whether it's the excitement
of the income tax refund..

78
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,650
..or the stress of going for the
wedding at Phupho's in-laws' house. '

79

00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,258
... and his theorems
and formulae take over.'

82
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:43,596
Quiet!

83
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,139
You, you, you...

84
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,732
Both of you three. Stand up.
- Sir...

85
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,003
Stand up.

86
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,608
What's going on here?

87
00:06:58,651 --> 00:06:59,743
Oh ...so this what you are up to!

88
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,217
lt's not mine,
Sir. Belongs to Aryan.

89
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:02,678
Sir, better give it back.

90
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,690
Want it back? Go take
it from the Principal.

91
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,760
But Sir, his daddy will scold him.

92
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:09,952
Will he scold you?

93
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:13,632
No he won't... Because
when he scores a zero...

94
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:14,757
...his daddy won't say
a word to his son...

95
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,164
...but he will not spare me.

96
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,761
Collect it from the
Principal if you score 60% .

97
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,638
Or else, the Principal...

98
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:22,901
..will give you a suspension
note instead of this Gameboy.

99
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,243
And mind it!

100
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,645
Whoever scores less than 60% ...

101
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,305
...in the pre-board Math exam...

102
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,912
Less than...?
- 60% .

103
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,645
Correct. The Principal
will not allow those...

104
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,050
...who get less than 60%
to take the final exams.

105
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,720
Then, don't blame me.

106
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:41,124
l've been putting in
time for the extra classes.

107
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:43,388
But if you don't work hard...

108
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,196
Where are you off to?

109
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,129
lt's an extra class, not compulsory.

110
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,063
lf you study my dear, you will pass.

111
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:50,658
We'll pass, Duggal sir.

112
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,998
You'd better worry
about your results.

113
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,669
'While Papa was making an effort...

114
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,146
...to make his students
attend extra classes.'

115
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,680
'l was bunking the
class at my college...

116
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,343
...trying to get a free t-shirt.'

117
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,284
Now, we'll have another prize round.

118
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:10,412
'That's my life.'

119
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,692
' l have to do all kinds of
crazy things to get a new wardrobe.'

120
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,230
One question each to both of you.

121
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:23,031
Right answer ... you win
brand new Puma t-shirts.

122
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:26,433
Wrong answer ... no t-shirt,
only bye-bye.

123
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,904
Okay, Payal, first question.

124
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,440
Which was the last
book that Mickey read?

125
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,711
Biology help guide, for the exams.

126
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,108
Mickey, correct answer?
- Yes.

127
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:39,241
Okay, Mickey.

128
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:41,981
How much money is
Payal carrying right now?

129
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,987
Sixty.
- Can't be just sixty?

130
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,990
Okay even if it's 160, l
will treat it as right answer.

131
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,253
But, if it's more than that.

132
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,455
You won't get any t-shirt.

133
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,729
Payal, show me your wallet.

134
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,063
'Stupid MC! What a weird question!'

135
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:58,732
'lf l had shown my wallet
in front of that crowd...

136
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,272
... the entire college would have
gotten to know how broke l was.'

137
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,198
Not showing my wallet.

138
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,469
To hell with your t-shirt.

139
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,201
What's wrong?

140
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,336
What's wrong?

141
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,215
Your loss ... Go on guys,
play some music!

142
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:11,807
What difference does it make?

143
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:12,942
At least, you could
have gotten the t-shirt.

144
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,076
Makes a difference to me.

145
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:15,744
Because there's just
45 bucks in my wallet.

146
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,085
Not even 60, just 45.
Makes a difference to me...

147
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,021
... 'cause, l've six
t-shirts in my wardrobe..

148
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,354
.. and not one of
them is an original.

149
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,757
And l need to take part in
such stupid competitions...

150
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,090
...for original t-shirts.

151
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:26,027
All because, my
dad's income is peanuts.

152
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,764
Why does a teacher
have to be my father?!

153
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,165
Why couldn't your Dad be my Papa?

154
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,762
Forget it, we don't
want their t-shirt.

155
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:35,966
All lousy colours.

156
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:40,238
Here... lets go for a drive...
it will cool you down.

157
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:43,782
Otherwise you will screw up
your chemistry test and mine.

158
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:48,044
You son-of-a-jeweller. Only
one thing you have done right.

159
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:51,453
That l was born to a rich father.
- Okay two things.

160
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,858
You also bought this car.

161
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:56,419
How many friends do
have on facebook?

162
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,052
'My brother, Deepu.'

163
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,256
'Sorry, he gets upset
if you call him Deepu.'

164
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:04,392
'My brother Sandeep or Sandy.'

165
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,005
' Difficult to say this is
the same Duggal Sir's son...

166
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,803
who gets all worked up
by the news of a wedding

167
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,070

168
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,274
Sandy...

169
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:20,876
Chill! They have scored a goal!

170
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,145
Sandy...

171
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,218
Hello, Kumar sir. Sandy here.

172
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:33,025
Sorry, sir. Yes, sir.

173
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,024
May l come over, sir?

174
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:37,893
Thank you, sir.

175
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,498
Here, cash for your rickshaw.
- And ice-cream?

176
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,306
This for the ice-cream.

177
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:45,901
Bye.

178
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,238
Hello, mummy.

179
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,507
There's a test tomorrow.

180
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:53,317
Can l go to Bunty's place to study?

181
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,922
lt's an English test.
How can Papa help?

182
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,252
Kumar sir is coming to tutor Bunty.

183
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,383
l'll study along with him.

184
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,386
Calling from a phone booth,
where else?

185
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,067
Please, Mummy or else l'll fail.

186
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,062
Love you Mummy, bye.

187
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:15,330
Faster buddy.

188
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,275
'Dear Deepu is a very
hard working student.'

189
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,411
'Just because, papa
can't afford a tutor...

190
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:26,142
...he goes to his
friend Bunty's house..

191
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:29,016
...to study with
his tutor, Kumar sir. '

192
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:32,948
He's out.

193
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,618
Just three balls left.

194
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,360
They'll lose.

195
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:38,557
Go on Sandy, bet on it.

196
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,899
lf they lose,
you'll get five for one.

197
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,366
You'll regret it later.

198
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:49,235
Hit a four. Singles
won't help morons.

199
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,567
What say Sandy?

200
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:54,908
Bet 100 bucks on them, they'll win.

201
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,639
Just one ball to go.
They'll surely lose.

202
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:58,441
They'll win.

203
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,385
Here. Sandy has bet
100 on a losing team.

204
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,589
Go, go,go,go!

205
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:13,659
Sixer. Yes, yes, yes.

206
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:14,990
We've won.

207
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,125
What's going on here?

208
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,393
Who is he?
- Sandeep... Sandy.

209
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,472
Just jumping with joy
because he won the bet.

210
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:23,134
With kids you start
behaving like one yourself.

211
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,409
And you... go dance with your mum.

212
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,271
Have you paid him his money?

213
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:30,473
l was just doing that.

214
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,345
Were you the one who'd called me?

215
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,012
Come here.

216
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,282
l said come here!

217
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,421
lf you ever do it again...

218
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:45,959
...first l'll remove
your name from the list...

219
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,959
then l will remove
your entire family.

220
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,362
Here's your money.
- Thank you, sir.

221
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:56,031
When it's time to pay,
we will call you.

222
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,239
Get that.
- Yes. - Now scram!

223
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,375
'Kumar sir, Deepu's tutor.'

224
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,970
'We found out what he
was teaching Deepu...

225
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,448
...and what Deepu was
learning from him...

226
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,382
...only after a big crisis.'

227
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,987
'Really, a very big crisis.'

228
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,315
'But until then,
Deepu really had a ball.'

229
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:27,199

''Big gaping holes''

265
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,250
Sir. Sir.

266
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,386
Just a minute, Sir.
- Yes.

267
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:38,720
Sir, my sum is right...

268
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,855
...why have you given me zero?

269
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:42,195
lt's right by fluke.
The method is wrong.

270
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,733
ls this the differential formula?
- Sir.

271
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,394
You should be careful.
- Mr. Duggal! Still not giving up?

272
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,596
Don't you have to go
for coaching today?

273
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,195
l'm on my way, Mr.
Jolly. l'm on my way.

274
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,604
Why do you make
such silly mistakes...

275
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:50,732
...don't repeat them again.
- Sorry, sir.

276
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:53,935
What's going on?

277
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,209
''Oh no!''

278
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:01,952
''Oh no no no!''

279
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:07,688
''Oh no!''

280
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,487
''Oho noooo!''

281
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,827
''lt comes and it goes''

00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:17,633
''lt goes and it comes''

283
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,705
Old creep! You fatso!

284
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,316
Yes, it's me this side.

285
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:37,313
Do we have about
Rs.2,000-2,500 extra?

286
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:38,788
How can l tell offhand?

287
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:39,915
Need to see the accounts.

288
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:42,391
How can you not know?!
You're so careless...

289
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,855
Yeah, right! l do
everything carelessly.

290
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:46,260
All the cooking and
cleaning just happen like that.

291
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,856
l suggest, you appoint someone else
to do all the housework carefully.

292
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,731
And pay her your entire
month's salary in wages.

293
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,930
Now don't get
started all over again.

294
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,465
Apart from monthly expenses,
there should be about 1 ,200 bucks.

295
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,877
lt's just the 21st of the month.

296
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,274
l don't teach Math, but l do
know how to read a calendar.

297
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,605
Why do you need it?

298
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:05,342
The scooter has been ruined.

299
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,616
l'll call you at the next red
light, this one has turned green.

300
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:11,755
Hang on! l am moving, am l not ?

301
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,762
'CCC. Chatwal Coaching Centre.'

302
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,899
'The owner of CCC, BSC.'

303
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,434
'Bittu Singh Chatwal.'

304
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,703
'Bittu Singh Chatwal, is short...'

305
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:31,367
'...but owns a big car,
and an even bigger temper.'

306
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,570
Mr. Chatwal, just one more week.

307
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,703
Listen to me.

308
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,507
He's been taking free
coaching for the past 15 days.

309
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,707
Come here.

310
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,910
After passing the exams,
he'll become an engineer.

311
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:43,385
And then you'll disappear.
- No sir, we are very honest.

312
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,855
We give coaching, not charity.
Pay up the fees, take the coaching.

313
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,858
''Pappu can't dance...''

314
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,326
Why have you turned the
class into a discotheque?!

315
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,397
Duggal Sir hasn't come yet
nothing better to do than disco.

316
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:54,789
lf Duggal Sir hasn't come why
don't you practice Math on your own?

317
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,595
We didn't pay the fees
to practise by ourselves.

318
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:57,794
Quiet! How dare you talk back!

319
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,736
Duggi. Duggal. - 'Papa spends
half his day at the school...'

320
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,534
'..and the other half at
Chatwal Coaching Centre.'

321
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:05,334
' No lndian teacher and
his family can survive...'

322
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,809
'...on a school salary '

323
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,938
'And Papa wants us to
go to the best school..'

324
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:12,539
'...where we will learn
to speak fluent English.'

325
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,344
'And the source of extra
income to pay the high fees...'

326
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,684
'...of the best school...
Chatwal Coaching Centre.'

327
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,949
Duggi, your students are singing...
..''Pappu can't dance...''

328
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:21,883
All of them are morons.

329
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,494
There are much better songs,
which they won't ever sing.

330
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,758
Duggi, get rid of this fossil.

331
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,430
Bittu Sir, don't insult my scooter.

332
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,431
You want me to call it a BMW?

333
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,974
Because of this scrap the entire
day's schedule gets messed up.

334
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:37,701
Just a minute, Bittu Sir.

335
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,640
lt will leave a bad
impression on the students.

336
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,847
Anyway l can't get it repainted
before the first of next month.

337
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,507
Forget about getting it painted.

338
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,915
Buy a new one. Work double shift.

339
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,986
l work single shifts,
and reach home at 9pm.

340
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,458
lf l work double shifts, l
will get home at midnight.

341
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,860
My kids will forget my face.

342
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,463
Looks much better now.

343
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,529
Yes, it's all camouflaged, let's go!

344
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,861
Bittu Sir. Thank you, sir.

345
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,060
l got it from your office.

346
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,934
Bittu Sir, l have one request.

347
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:09,869
No, no.

348
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,408
No leave before engineering exams.

349
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,943
Bittu Sir, hear me out!

350
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,537
There's a wedding in my
sister's in-law's family.

351
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:17,478
Now using your sister for an excuse.

352
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,876
l'm not asking for an increment.
Just leave.

353
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,475
l'll work double shifts, sir.

354
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,011
l'll cut your salary for the leave

355
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:24,679
and won't pay extra
for the double shift.

356
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:26,947
Can we go in now?! Please!

357
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,551
What a rascal!

358
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,433
'Eventually chicken
was cooked for dinner.'

359
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,098
'Because Phupho had come home,
directly from Meerut.'

360
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,839
'ln the morning, she gave some
explosive news on the phone...

361
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,568
...and in the evening
she landed herself.'

362
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,041
'Surprise visit.'

363
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:50,971
'To explode an even bigger bomb!'

364
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:53,441
All four of you will have to come...

365
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:56,919
...and you'll have to come by car.
- By car?

366
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:58,980
And where will the car come from?

367
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:00,515
Buy one.

368
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,787
Buy One?! lt's a
pointless expense, Urmi.

369
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,787
What are you saying?

370
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,592
And the traffic is so horrible...

371
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,064
lt takes hours to get anywhere.

372
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,468
Scooters are the best, you can
squeeze your way through any jam.

373
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,668
Do you even know the
mileage of a scooter?

374
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,667
l get at least 60-70 km/ltr.

375
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,746
'Papa's old list of
excuses for not buying a car.'

376
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,470
'When Phupho insisted...

377
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:26,073
...Papa pulled out his
favourite red file.'

378
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:27,481
l'll show you my red file.

379
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:28,610
Wait. Just wait.

380
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,151
'lncome tax returns, salary slips,
the monthly expenditure budget...

381
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,953
...Papa showed everything in
the file to make his point.'

382
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:39,753
'The Red File. The red signal
for any of our expensive requests.'

383
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,763
Fine, if you can't buy one,
then rent a car for two days.

384
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,497
But you'll have to
come in a car, that's it.

385
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,570
l know who has
been brainwashing her!

386
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,634
Who are they to dictate
how we should travel...

387
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:54,769
Forget the scooter,
if we feel like it

388
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,904
we will travel on a bullock-cart...

389
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,038
...why do your in-laws get bothered?

390
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:59,917
lf it's such a big issue, then
we won't even attend the wedding!

391
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,048
What will l tell my father-in-law?

392
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,187
Tell him, your brother and his
family were coming by a big car.

393
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,724
Better. Tell them they
were coming in a Mercedes.

394
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,520
But, on the way a
truck rammed into the car.

395
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:10,925
The Mercedes was smashed and
so was your brother's family.

396
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:12,053
What nonsense!

397
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,132
Who'll believe that
you have a Mercedes?

398
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:16,200
Fine. So make us die
in an Ambassador car.

399
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,928
Even in death l don't get the
honour of driving a Mercedes.

400
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:35,677
Quiet!

401
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:36,811
Phupho is crying.

402
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:50,898
All my sisters-in-law and their
maternal families have cars...

403
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:53,036
Only my brother doesn't have one.

404
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:57,906
They taunt me each time, you come
vrooming on your scooter to visit us.

405
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:02,775
lf you don't come at all,
l'll die of shame.

406
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:04,773
But if you come by your scooter...

407
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:05,907
...they will torture me
to death with the taunts.

408
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:13,782
Please save me.

409
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:16,651
Go on... eat your food.

410
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,591
He always bullies me...

411
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:22,258
...just because l am younger.
- Hush now!

412
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:23,858
All of us will come for the wedding.

413
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:26,861
By car?

414
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:27,996
Yes, by car.

415
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,798
Wha?!
- What wha-?

416
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,599
Her in-laws keep
taunting her in Meerut...

417
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,678
...and we do
nothing sitting in Delhi.

418
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:36,140
l'll see to it that
this stops right now.

419
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:39,207
'Mummy made the promise to Phupho.'

420
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,615
'But left all the
calculations to Duggal Sir.'

421
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:44,686
'A gift worth 5,000,
cash for the groom.'

422
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:47,620
'New clothes to
wear at the wedding...

423
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:49,626
...and now the new
hassle of renting a car.'

424
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,891
Mrs. Diwedi. Mrs. Diwedi.

425
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,029
Mrs. Diwedi.

426
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:04,631
Mrs. Diwedi.

427
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:24,786
Hello...
- Hello

428
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:26,659
Need to go to the toilet?
- No.

429
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,198
You can, if you need to.

430
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,858
l'll keep an eye on the class.

431
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,863
Hey, no cheating.
Aditi, do your own work.

432
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,064
Mrs. Diwedi.
- Yes.

433
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:37,674
l read in the papers,
that service tax...

434
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:40,267
...will be charged on taxis.

435
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:43,737
Your elder brother has a taxi
business, doesn't he? - Yes.

436
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:45,680
Very nice. How is it going?

437
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,149
Very nice, excellent.

438
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:50,688
Actually, last Diwali he
bought four new cars. - Really.

439
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:54,883
Even l've taken out some money
from my savings and invested it...

440
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:56,150
ln the taxis... in partnership.

441
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:58,755
lt's a good side income.

442
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:03,231
Mr. Duggal, these days a
side income is a must.

443
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:04,961
Why don't you also start something?

444
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,032
lt's easy for you.

445
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,767
Mr and Mrs. Diwedi, double income.

446
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:12,767
Very nice.

447
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,709
And if anyone in the
school requires taxi services...

448
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,303
...then can they approach you..
- Yes, of course.

449
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:18,315
l even give a teacher's discount.

450
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,974
Really?!
- Yes.

451
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:23,721
Mrs. Diwedi, if someone
needs a taxi to go to Meerut...

452
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:26,256
...Only for two days,
what will be the rate?

453
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:30,795
For Meerut, we've a package
deal of one night and two days.

454
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:33,330
For 5,400 rupees. All inclusive.

455
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:35,995
For our fellow-teachers,
it's only 5,000 rupees.

456
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:40,201
Five thou!
- Yes. Why, do you need one?

457
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,735
No. l was just asking
for general knowledge.

458
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:44,866
Okay.

459
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:49,811
lf someone you know needs a taxi,
then do let me know, Mr. Duggal.

460
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,214
Come on, come on
time's up. Time's up.

461
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:07,162
Sir, just a minute.
Please, just a minute.

462
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,769
This disgusting woman, rejected
the love of her god-like husband...

463
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:15,829
...instead chose to
romance the postman.

464
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:20,774
This treacherous woman
continued in her wicked ways....

465
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:24,781
With the help of her boyfriend..

466
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:28,979
...she made fake
stab wounds on her back.

467
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:32,847
And then...

468
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:37,384
Every day you watch this nonsense.

469
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:38,792
Have you finished your homework?

470
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:40,797
Yes, it's Sanskrit. Do
you want to check it?

471
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:44,001
Sanskrit! Watch Discovery Channel.

472
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,126
Watch History Channel.

473
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:46,260
Always watching this rubbish.

474
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,805
Papa, it's news l'm watching.
- Don't try teaching me!

475
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:50,331
Lower the volume!

476
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:55,210
And then she lodged an
FlR against her husband.

477
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:59,280
Now don't stay awake all night.

478
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:04,683
All the car-rental stress
will any way not let me sleep.

479
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:07,154
Minimum rental charges are 5,000.

480
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:11,084
You should have thought more
before you made your big promises.

481
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:14,427
Now you don't have to taunt me.
l couldn't bear Urmi's despair.

482
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:16,830
But if you can't arrange
for it, then just call her.

483
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,368
We won't go.
- That's not possible.

484
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,835
You have given your word.
l have to honour that.

485
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,838
l will think of something.

486
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:27,101
We would've never
faced such a situation...

487
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:28,304
...if you hadn't
made me quit my job.

488
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,038
1 7 years ago...

489
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,844
1 7 years ago, your
income was more than mine...

490
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:35,442
...you could have become the
head librarian by now. l know!

491
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:36,911
Go to sleep.

492
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:40,116
The head librarian is entitled
for an official car, with a driver.

493
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,858
Sorry. l couldn't
fulfill your fantasy...

494
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,452
...of roaming around in an
Ambassador car with a hunky driver.

495
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:47,057
They give an Esteem car these days.

496
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,325
No more Ambassadors.

497
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,924
They might be giving
Japanese cars, who cares.

498
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,059
Don't bother me. Go to sleep.

499
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,536
Blank...

500
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:11,946
Kusum.

501
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:14,615
Kusum.

502
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,496
Stop sulking, here read this.

503
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,898
What lousy handwriting. - You're
missing the point. Go on read it.

504
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:30,100
Dear respected Sir,
please give me passing marks.

505
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:33,910
For the marks that you give me,

506
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:36,913
..my Daddy will pay you a
proportionate amount of money.

507
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:42,313
For example: 20 marks is
equal to 20,000 rupees.

508
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:47,051
One thousand rupees for one mark.

509
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:53,987
Please call on 982161 1674.

510
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:56,998
Thanking you,
sincerely roll no. 1393.

511
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,372
''Beware of this scoundrel...''

512
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:39,500
Deepu!
- ''Don't go by his innocent face,

513
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,635
behind this face is devilish rogue.''

514
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,981
The things these people do.

515
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:47,041
Aren't they afraid?

516
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:51,046
What if they get caught?

517
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:55,051
ls it a very big risk?
- Go to sleep.

518
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:59,060
'Don't misjudge my Papa and Mummy.'

519
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:03,996
'For important things like
electricity, water, telephone...

520
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:08,061
...ration, they are not averse to
paying bribes like everyone else'

521
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,330
'They are just too scared
to accept it themselves.'

522
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:10,598
'Scared of getting caught!'

523
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:14,067
'They didn't have the courage to
take money for giving marks...'

524
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:17,080
'...but they still had to
arrange for a car, to go to Meerut.'

525
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:20,080
'Both of them kept
tossing and turning all night.'

526
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:21,609
'l don't know what
complicated mathematical solution

527
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:22,743
Papa was trying to come up with.'

528
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,681
'But Mummy came up
with a brilliant idea.'

529
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,568
Mr. Farooqi. Good morning.

530
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:40,299
Good morning? Good morning,
good morning.

531
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:41,497
Good morning.

532
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:44,371
l always walk to
most of my destinations.

533
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:47,044
But nowadays...

534
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:49,045
...to buy milk you
travel by scooter or car...

535
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,512
...to buy veggies you
travel by scooter or car.

536
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:52,446
Everybody has become
slaves of their vehicles.

537
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,451
That's why l say, every child
should receive army training.

538
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:57,578
You know, Urmi..
- The one who lives in Meerut?

539
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,180
Yes. Her younger sister-in-law
is getting married, in Meerut.

540
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:01,650
Congratulations, Mr. Duggal.

541
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,056
We'll surely attend the wedding.

542
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:04,185
Does the card have only my name...

543
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:05,728
...or does it say,
Mr. Farooqi and family.

544
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,058
No, that's not what...

545
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,257
No need to be formal.

546
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,061
lnflation has shot up like crazy.

547
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:11,192
lf they invite even one
member from each family...

548
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:13,065
...then there'll be so many guests.

549
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:16,072
We need your car.
- Car? Why?

550
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:17,601
What's the problem?

551
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,337
Urmi's sister-in-law...
wedding... trip to Meerut.

552
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,345
Two days, Saturday and Sunday.

553
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:23,539
This weekend? -This one.

554
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,479
One that's coming up.
- Coming up.

555
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:26,607
Tomorrow and the day after.

556
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,742
Right!

557
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:31,151
Oh well... lt's your car, you
can take it whenever you want.

558
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:32,348
See, l told you.

559
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:35,091
But l need to get it repaired.

560
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:37,090
You'll be travelling on the highway.

561
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,823
lf it breaks down, l'll feel bad.

562
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,757
Babu Mechanic will
deliver it back next week.

563
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:46,162
Then you can take it to Agra,
why only Meerut.

564
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,298
Your younger grandson has to be
admitted to school this year. Right?

565
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,299
But why should you worry...

566
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,109
...Duggal Ji will
get him admitted...

567
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:57,511
...just like he got your elder
grandson admitted. lsn't it?

568
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:01,651
He really values your family a lot.

569
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:03,586
He never bothers about
anyone else's admission.

570
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,121
Do you even know what the
other teachers are up to?!

571
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:09,591
They charge at least 150,000 for
arranging admission into nursery.

572
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:12,459
They have turned it into
a business. How very sad!

573
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,189
You need the car only
till Meerut, isn't it?

574
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,667
Meerut is almost Delhi now.

575
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,336
lt will get there without
any hitches. You take it.

576
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,133
No, but if you're
insisting that we can't go...

577
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,868
...then we won't go. - No, it
will go. Of course, it'll go.

578
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:28,543
Take it. - Now that you
are forcing us... What say?

579
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:31,215
We can't hurt your sentiments,
Farooqi.

580
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:33,541
Thank you very much, l'll
come and collect the keys.

581
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:49,223
Where are they?

582
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:52,827
He's testing.

583
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,572
Wonderful. Wonderful.

584
00:32:58,676 --> 00:32:59,700
l'm so proud.

585
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,904
You are an amazing driver.

586
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,313
Here. Drive as
carefully on the highway.

587
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,440
Thank you.

588
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,719
Thank you very much, Farooqi.

589
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,844
Why are you sitting
in the front, Kusum?

590
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:11,182
Sit at the back.

591
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:13,189
l'll sit in the front, l'll
have to keep an eye on the road.

592
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:15,251
Let the driver keep an
eye on the road, please.

593
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,655
Sit down. Or else,
Farooqi might change his mind.

594
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:21,596
Oh... ok! Where's Deepu? Deepu!

595
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,460
Don't worry, Farooqi.

596
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,201
We'll be back soon.

597
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:28,268
l won't go if Papa sits at the back.

598
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,204
Quiet, wear your hat and
pull up your pants. Get in.

599
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,333
Duggal.
- Sorry!

600
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:33,467
Come on.

601
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:39,275
Take good care... Look after it.
Don't leave it all alone... Duggal.

602
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:40,874
lt's Allah's gift...

603
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:45,814
''So what if the horse is borrowed.''

604
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:49,822
''Once mounted, we are kings''

605
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:55,297
''So what if the dress is borrowed''

606
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,426
''Now we are
wearing it, we are dudes''

607
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,508
Don't roll it down!
- Enjoy the fresh air.

608
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,243
What a foul smell.

609
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:16,445
lt's freezing! We'll
all turn into ice-cream.

610
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:19,647
Broke it.

611
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:21,452
Not done...

612
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:24,256
Farooqi on the phone.
Fix it, quickly.

613
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:25,386
And you drive slowly.

614
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,387
Hello, Farooqi.

615
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:29,390
Everything is fine.

616
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:30,794
The car is also fine.

617
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:35,463
Don't worry. Everyone thanks you.

618
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:40,334
Hey! Wake up! Enjoy the scenery.

619
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:42,677
Potato.
- Potato.

620
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:47,944
Potato paratha: 15, cauliflower
paratha: 18, cottage cheese: 45..

621
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:49,280
Cheese... 45!!!

622
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,883
Alright, get me a plain paratha!

623
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:00,429
Alright... l'll have potato as well.

624
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:02,961
Get me cheese.
- Cheese? No cheese.

625
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:05,961
Cheese is 45!

626
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,368
And the cheese here is
not good. lt's not safe.

627
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,700
We're all having potato parathas,
you also have potato.

628
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,503
He'll also have potato.
- Yes, sir.

629
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,635
What's wrong with him?

630
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,308
Where are you going with the keys?

631
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,507
Are you planning to starve?

632
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:21,442
Gosh! Farooqi again!

633
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:23,577
Yes, Farooqi.

634
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,523
No, that sound is not from the car.

635
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:30,725
We're at a roadside eatery. lt's
all the background noise here.

636
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:34,455
''Pappu looks like a foreigner.''

637
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:36,396
''Foreigner.''

638
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:39,800
''Rado watch on his hands,
and Gucci perfume.''

639
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,395
''But Pappu can't dance..''

640
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:50,542
''Below the blue sky...''

641
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,616
''But Pappu can't dance...''

642
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,751
''The nature spreads it's love.''

643
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,828
''But Pappu can't dance... ''

644
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,965
''Below the blue sky...''
- ''But Pappu can't dance...''

645
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:11,763
Payal, stop the car.

646
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:13,359
''The nature spreads its love.''
- Stop the car.

647
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:15,371
Stop, stop here.
- Stop.

648
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:16,497
''Like this...''

649
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,909
Fighting like kids all the time.

650
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,569
Kusum!
- Why can't everyone chill?!

651
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,374
Sorry. Now come on!

652
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:24,641
Don't get mad.

653
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:26,774
Say sorry.
- Sorry, dude.

654
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:28,442
Why should l apologize?
- Say sorry.

655
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:29,645
Sorry Mummy, come back.

656
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:31,051
Okay, you sit in the front,
l'll sit at the back.

657
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:33,387
l'll sit at the back,
you sit in front. Come on.

658
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:34,515
Come now.

659
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:37,389
''Hope no one finds out''

660
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:41,596
'' the feet are too
small for the shoes''

661
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:47,471
'' Hope no one finds out''

662
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:51,668
'' the grandeur and style are fake.''

663
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,803
''So what if the horse is borrowed.''

664
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:58,006
''Once mounted, we are kings''

665
00:36:58,115 --> 00:37:00,083
''So what if the dress is borrowed''

666
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:02,482
''Now we are wearing it,
we are dudes.''

667
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,947
''So what if the horse is borrowed.''

668
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:10,086
''Once mounted, we are kings''

669
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:15,631
''So what if the dress is borrowed''

670
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,696
''Now we are wearing it,
we are dudes.''

671
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:30,508
Thanks Sis-in-law for
helping me save face... thanks.

672
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:34,049
Let it be. The boys will move it.

673
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:36,051
Rabinder, Gajender, come here.

674
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:37,511
Move this junk.

675
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,112
Speed up, you lazybones!

676
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:41,657
Come, Santosh.
- ls he an Aamir Khan fan?

677
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,852
Hey Gajani, who will park this?

678
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:49,459
Santosh, you never said anything
about buying a new car. - Not new...

679
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:52,536
No Father-in-law,
it's not new any more.

680
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:54,537
My brother thought of
giving us a surprise.

681
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,072
lt's a wonderful surprise.

682
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:57,538
Well done, well done.

683
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:00,541
Last time, you came
here tired and sweaty.

684
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:01,873
l felt like telling you,

685
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:04,140
why do you always come
vrooming on that old scooter.

686
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:05,476
Buy a car.

687
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,551
But l felta bit awkward saying it.

688
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:08,676
So l didn't say it.

689
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:09,810
Mr. Bajaj, come here.

690
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,684
Meet Urmi's elder brother.

691
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,082
He's a Professor in Delhi.

692
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,083
Urmi, show them their rooms.

693
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:18,888
Let them freshen up.

694
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,553
Lets go, Mr. Bajaj,
we've got loads to do.

695
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,157
Urmi. Get them something to eat.

696
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:24,825
lndu, Manju! How are you?

697
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:26,635
Kiddoes, you don't remember them!

698
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:29,032
They are Phupho's 'famous'
car-owning sisters-in-law.

699
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:30,898
You look tired.

700
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:33,841
lf the car is nice, the
journey is never tiring.

701
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:34,968
Right?

702
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:38,710
They are so jealous to see the car.

703
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,107
What's going on, Urmi?

704
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:41,775
New car, Professor...

705
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:43,920
Why all the lies?
- Have you lied?

706
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,113
No, you haven't? Relax! You
haven't committed any sin.

707
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:46,918
lt's not about committing a sin.

708
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:49,049
What if they discover the truth?
- lt's just a matter of one day.

709
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,593
You'll be leaving tomorrow morning.

710
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:53,129
Can't you control
yourself for one day, for me?

711
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,061
Papa. Please chill.

712
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:56,658
We've come in a borrowed car,

713
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:57,791
and they have declared
you are a Professor.

714
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:58,926
lmagine, if we had
come in our own car..

715
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:00,060
...they would have
appointed you vice-principal.

716
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,536
You can joke about it all you want.

717
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,129
But l've a very bad
feeling about this.

718
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,131
Somehow the wedding
should go smoothly, that's it.

719
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:08,806
Now what do you want,
walking all over me?!

720
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:31,568
Stop you thief!

721
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:35,036
Stop. Whose car are you robbing now?

722
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:42,638
This time l catch you, you
will be gone for a long time.

723
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:46,246
Fa ... roo ... qi.

724
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,242
Farooqi?

725
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:50,582
Yes? Oh yes, yes. Thank you.
- Santosh.

726
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:51,985
Why are you hanging
around with the ladies?

727
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:53,586
What's that rubbish you are
drinking? Come have a real drink.

728
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:54,715
Come with me.

729
00:39:58,763 --> 00:39:59,787
Urmi, you didn't get flowers!

730
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:00,921
Keep your hair back.

731
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:02,259
Why is it always so messy?

732
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,726
Why are you dressed in
your school uniform?

733
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:07,595
For the wedding you should've
dressed up... some decent clothes...

734
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:09,730
Phupho. Help!
- Kusum?

735
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,005
Just one bracelet, you
should have worn some bangles.

736
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,071
Phupho. Help!

737
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:21,144
Santosh, this is Mr. Katiyar.

738
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:25,749
He organizes all the tents
used in Meerut weddings.

739
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,880
Hello.

740
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,288
This is Prof. Duggal from Delhi.

741
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:31,291
He is Urmi's elder brother.
- Okay.

742
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:33,022
What took you so long?

743
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:37,098
Were you getting all the thieves
and dacoits of Meerut arrested?

744
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:40,633
No such luck. Some
even followed me here.

745
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,632
Has some Farooqi
come here from Delhi?

746
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:44,640
l don't know any.

747
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:47,100
Can't say about the
bridegroom's family.

748
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:49,106
But what has this Farooqi done?

749
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:50,237
No, he hasn't done anything.

750
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:54,114
Some thief was trying to
steal the poor man's car.

751
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:55,708
Did he manage to steal it?

752
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:57,649
Am l a good-for-nothing lnspector?

753
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:01,719
No way Rawat! Nothing can go
wrong when you are around!

754
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:03,254
Please call Farooqi.

755
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,725
His car is in the
middle of the road.

756
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:05,986
Rab! Gaj!

757
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,266
Come here quick.

758
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:13,126
Go look for this Farooqi.

759
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:14,261
Give the car papers to him.

760
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:16,196
Are you Farooqi?

761
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,331
Are you Farooqi?

762
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:21,673
Farooqi? Farooqi?

763
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,144
Your friend just asked me.

764
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,081
Rab Gaj did you find Farooqi?!

765
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:28,208
We're looking for him.

766
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,343
Farooqi? Farooqi? Farooqi?

767
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:30,886
Get lost.

768
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,012
There is no Farooqi here?

769
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:35,224
Mr. Sharma, l tell you
this is becoming a big mess.

770
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:36,750
What should we do?

771
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:37,885
The wedding
procession is about to arrive.

772
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:39,152
What am l there for?

773
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,764
You take care of the guests.
l will take care of Farooqi.

774
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,024
Owner is missing.

775
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:46,167
No one is coming
forward to claim it.

776
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:49,900
You check if it is
listed under stolen vehicles?

777
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:53,039
And inform the bomb squad as well.

778
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:59,049
l heard you are
looking for me, Commissioner.

779
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:00,173
lnspector, not Commissioner.

780
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:01,909
Who are you?

781
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:03,777
The owner of the car.

782
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:04,912
Farooqi?

783
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,780
l had gone to the bathroom.

784
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:08,916
You would've been in big trouble.

785
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:11,122
l had even informed the bomb squad.

786
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:12,920
Now park it properly.

787
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,054
lt's blocking the road.

788
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,864
And listen, take the papers.

789
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,397
What's the
registration number of the car?

790
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:29,405
Car... DL lt's Delhi car.. DL...
- DL what?

791
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:31,874
lt's DL something.

792
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:34,876
DL...
- DL. DL.

793
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:37,810
Come here. We will together
try to remember the number.

794
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:39,148
You don't even know how to drive.

795
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:42,292
What would've you told
Farooqi if l wasn't here to help?

796
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,961
Don't you owe me one?

797
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:49,364
Sure, sir. l am at
a loss of words...

798
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:54,166
You have thanked me enough in
words. No harm using your hands.

799
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:56,762
Yes, of course.
Thank you very much, sir.

800
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:01,176
You are the teacher, why do l
have to teach you everything?

801
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:05,772
l am just a teacher, lnspector.

802
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:06,974
Please, do try to understand.

803
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,108
Basic and allowances...

804
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:10,243
All add up to Rs.8,000 per month.

805
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:11,844
You make money
from tuitions as well.

806
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:12,980
l know.

807
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,457
Not the envelope. That's Rs. 5,001 .

808
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:25,262
l am not asking for
any more than that.

809
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,131
What l will get from you,
will go into my son's tuition.

810
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:29,396
You don't understand.

811
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:30,530
This is for the bridegroom.

812
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:32,001
How do l know you
haven't stolen the car?

813
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:34,207
Should l call Mr. Sharma?
We will find out everything.

814
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:35,335
No, no. That will be a disaster!

815
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,811
Look, my younger sister her
sisters-in-law, they all have cars...

816
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:39,280
Why should l care
about sisters-in-law?

817
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,818
Hey listen, call Mr. Sharma here.

818
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:42,943
No, don't.

819
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:45,817
Uncle! What happened?
- Get lost.

820
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:48,882
Not you. Not you.

821
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,095
lt's a tough job being a cop.

822
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:54,223
Not as easy as teaching...

823
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:56,492
... take one or two classes
and relax the rest of the time.

824
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,965
Mr. Sharma respects me.

825
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:01,833
Anyway, 5,000 is
more than enough for me.

826
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,163
You can keep the change.

827
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,839
Go on, take it. No hard feelings.

828
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:10,039
Next time, you borrow a car
make sure you remember its number.

829
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:13,440
Now move along, the wedding
procession must be arriving.

830
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:19,122
Tyagi, cancel the bomb squad.

831
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:24,384
''ls the bride a beauty''

832
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:29,064
''Or is she ugly and snooty''

833
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:34,937
''He will marry her, only
after seeing her face.''

834
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:39,867
''This condition,
the groom has laid.''

835
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:43,412
''Without the music
Without the horse''

836
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,948
''Without even tying the knot''

837
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,883
''The groom has barged
into the bride's house''

838
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:51,546
''Making a big mess.''

839
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:30,586
''He is trying to sneak in.
Hiding in a corner''

840
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:33,128
''He looks like an ace thief''

841
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,323
''Jumping over the walls...''

842
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:37,525
''The crook talks nonsense...''

843
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:38,931
''Why is the bride going crazy''

844
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:42,597
''Over this stupid moron?''

845
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:49,275
''Without the music
Without the horse''

846
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:52,007
''Without even tying the knot''

847
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,230
''He looks stunned...
- Oh yes''

848
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:14,497
''He looks dazed...
- Oh yes.''

849
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,971
''He is surely a goon...
- Oh yes''

850
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:19,167
''He is surely a rogue...
- Oh yes.''

851
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,642
''The groom looks pale''

852
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:23,372
''Where has he been?''

853
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:33,051
''Everyone's been searching
for him. Where has he been?''

854
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,460
''So what mischief
has he been up to?''

855
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:42,655
''Whose lock did he break?''

856
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,995
''What new mess has he made?''

857
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:46,535
''Everybody should get to know.''

858
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:49,005
''He is in for a thrashing''

859
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:51,597
''lf the groom is trapped.''

''Without the music
Without the horse''

863
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:06,088
''Without even tying the knot''

864
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,030
''Watch out for that''

865
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:17,157
''Sharp kohl.''

866
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:18,291
''ls it her beauty''

867
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:19,426
''Or is it a long sword.''

868
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:26,235
''What a dress! How ornate!''

869
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,367
''ln each lock of hair''

870
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:28,569
''Are at least four guys trapped.''

871
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:35,642
''The bride is a flower in bloom.''

872
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:38,050
''The groom is a trash can.''

873
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:40,185
''A fairy is paired with a monkey''

874
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,053
''How bizarre!''

875
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:45,059
''The bride and
groom are in a trance''

876
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:47,130
''The rest of the world can rot.''

877
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,666
''Without the music
Without the horse''

878
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:56,068
''Without even tying the knot''

879
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:58,403
''The groom has barged
into the bride's house''

880
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:01,068
''Making a big mess.''

881
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:23,429
''The bride and
groom are in a trance''

882
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:25,501
''The bride is cute
The groom is a dude''

883
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:27,297
''Love has exploded''

884
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,235
''Their eyes are glued.''

885
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:31,170
''lt's a party!''

886
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:33,175
''Let the world go and rot.''

887
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:59,132
Goodbye!
- Santosh, your presence...

888
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:00,260
...added so much
life to the wedding.

889
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:01,801
l'm so happy you could come.

890
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:03,530
Bless you.

891
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,664
Do come again in your car.

892
00:49:04,841 --> 00:49:06,138
This is a gift
from the bridegroom...

893
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:07,540
...for all the sisters.

894
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:08,668
Thank you.

895
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,269
And this is for you.

896
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:12,744
No need for me.
- l will take Mummy's as well.

897
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:15,208
Thank you so much.

898
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,612
l love you, Sister-in-law.

899
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:18,878
Bye.

900
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:21,221
Tata, tata!

901
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,293
Three thousand for you.
And three thousand for me.

902
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:28,621
That makes Rs.6,000.

903
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:33,363
What did l say... lt comes in
one hand and goes from the other.

904
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,563
Now we can get your
bangles back, Kusum.

905
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:38,640
Mr. Farooqi. l mean Mr. Duggal.

906
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:40,699
Don't forget the car's number?

907
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:44,573
Papa, how does he
know uncle Farooqi?

908
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:48,247
You pull up your pants.

909
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,511
lt's not even been a year and
you have ruined their bottoms.

910
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:53,518
Who will buy new pants
for you? Your father?

911
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:54,647
Yes, who else.

912
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,521
Stop, stop. The shop is right here.

913
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:02,597
Neel Gagan Jewellers. Sunday closed.

914
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:04,593
Sunday closed!

915
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:07,660
Let's go.

916
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:12,401
''The sweetmeat was
tasty until yesterday.''

917
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,409
''Tasty. Tasty.''

918
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:16,211
''lt has become bland now.''

919
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:18,281
''Sweetmeat''

920
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:20,213
''Sweetmeat, Sweetmeat, Sweetmeat,
Sweetmeat.''

921
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:22,683
''Sweetmeat, Sweetmeat, Sweetmeat,
Sweetmeat.''

922
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,827
''The sweetmeat was
tasty until yesterday.''

923
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:32,292
''lt was so tasty.''

924
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:34,830
''lt has become bland now.''

925
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:41,230
''The mare which we rode earlier.''

926
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:44,705
''lt will kick us now''

927
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:45,832
''Come on.''

928
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,308
Hang on Payal, l will guide you.

929
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,242
l'll manage, Papa.
- You will need guiding, l'll do it.

930
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:55,443
Move aside, Deepu. Come on.
Reverse it. Come on. Come on.

931
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:57,252
Keep coming. Keep coming.

932
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:58,378
Keep coming. Keep coming.

933
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,250
Steer left... left...

934
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:02,325
Keep coming. Good, very good.

935
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:10,924
Papa.

936
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:17,671
What happened? ls there a calamity?

937
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:20,275
Where are you off to
with that beaming face?

938
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:28,348
What has happened?

939
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:31,421
Tail-light and bumper gone.
But there is no dent.

940
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:32,545
What happened, Arora?

941
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:35,284
Poor Farooqi loaned
his car to Duggal...

942
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:37,360
...and he has gone and wrecked it.

943
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:38,951
You should drive a
borrowed car carefully.

944
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:41,895
Yes. - That's why we
never borrow anything.

945
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:43,491
How much would it cost?

946
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,966
Duggal, you should
have driven it yourself.

947
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:47,969
lt's not a toy that you
give it to your children.

948
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:50,505
Why are you all butting in?
- Payal, please.

949
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:54,304
Why shouldn't they...
otherwise you will sneak off.

950
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:55,969
Now don't pass personal remarks.

951
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:58,313
We will pay for the damages.

952
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:00,440
Who will let you go without paying!

953
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:01,574
Who is going anyway?

954
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:04,051
l had told you not
to lend them our car.

955
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:06,522
But generosity is
always bursting out of you.

956
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:08,723
Look, now the tail-light is busted.

957
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,722
lt will cost around 5,000 to fix it.

958
00:52:10,827 --> 00:52:12,727
Why are you
complicating things, Uncle Arora?

959
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,931
500 for the tail-light,
1 ,000 for the bumper...

960
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:16,726
...with labour
included it'll be 2,000 max.

961
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:20,334
lt's a car and not
your papa's scooter.

962
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:21,927
As if you have
bought a lot of lights.

963
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:23,801
l haven't even bought an
lPL team, but l know...

964
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:24,931
Deepu, both of you,
go upstairs. Come on.

965
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:26,338
Papa, look how they are...

966
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:27,467
Go home.
- They are so rude!

967
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:29,340
l said, go up!
- Payal. Payal, take the keys.

968
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:30,470
Go. Go.

969
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:35,544
l am very sorry, Farooqi.

970
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:39,746
Look at that! Washing
his hands off with a sorry!

971
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,356
Sorry won't cover the damages.

972
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:43,824
Enough of this bickering!

973
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:46,958
Here's the money... for repairs.

974
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:51,360
No, l will send the
mechanic with the bill.

975
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:52,960
You pay him yourself.

976
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:55,367
When she is paying in cash,
why don't you take it?

977
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:58,370
Count it! lt's Rs.6,000.

978
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:01,901
You can keep the balance
after paying for the repair.

979
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:03,102
Let's go.

980
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:06,846
Don't show off money .6,000.

981
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,918
You have made a business out
of arranging school admissions.

982
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:13,384
Don't l know from where
you are getting this money?!

983
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:15,386
lf you are making so much then...

984
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:17,858
...why not buy your own car?

985
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:19,861
Why come running to
us to borrow our car?

986
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:22,454
Stop it! That's enough.

987
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:29,394
There will be a car
parked outside my house...

988
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:31,474
...in the next 15 days. l swear!

989
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:34,741
Relax, Duggal. We have
done the settlement.

990
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:35,936
Which car are you planning to buy?

991
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,809
Do give us a treat, soon
as the car is delivered.

992
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:38,938
Enough guys, don't needle him.

993
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,414
''What about them? How Duggal
growled at me... me a woman.''

994
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:42,417
''lf anyone says anything
to his brat of a daughter,

995
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:44,487
he will coming charging.''

996
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:12,505
Didn't you hear what l said?

997
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,641
We too are buying a car.

998
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,852
Your wish is coming true.

999
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:22,851
Jump around, sing and dance.

1000
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:25,458
Your favorite song
''Paapu can't dance ''

1001
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,120
You know it all...

1002
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,458
...the rent, their fees,
medicines...

1003
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:31,056
...household expenses, DVD and TV.

1004
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:34,534
...Our total income is
20,000 and expenses are 24,000.

1005
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:35,662
Always in the negative...

1006
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:36,796
Where will the money
come from for the car?

1007
00:54:36,906 --> 00:54:38,464
The down payment will be
approximately 40,000-50,000.

1008
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:39,599
The monthly installments
will be about 3,000-4,000.

1009
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:40,733
How will you pay for it?

1010
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:42,471
l haven't bought the
lPL team but l know.

1011
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:44,740
Now we all will be
insulted because of you, Papa.

1012
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:47,078
l am going to Bunty's house.
l have a history test.

1013
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:48,615
l was parking the car on my own.

1014
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:50,879
This mess wouldn't have
happened if you hadn't interfered.

1015
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:52,078
The car we anyway won't buy...

1016
00:54:52,188 --> 00:54:54,486
but now Salma will
make life miserable...

1017
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:56,559
...for me after 15 days.

1018
00:54:58,928 --> 00:54:59,952
So l am the villain!!

1019
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:02,559
Everybody will be
humiliated because of me!!

1020
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:03,823
Take it easy.

1021
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:05,901
We know our limits.

1022
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,967
But l am saying that
we will buy a car.

1023
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:09,970
Don't my words hold any value?

1024
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,565
Will l have to prove
myself to my own family?

1025
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:16,035
Fine then...

1026
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:19,037
Now no matter what happens.

1027
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:22,575
The Duggals will own a car.

1028
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:23,776
Wait and watch!

1029
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:27,920
'The hood is up, this cobra is ready
to attack! lt will spew venom!'

1030
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:33,585
'After the break, we will
show you its next deadly move.'

1031
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:34,721
'Don't move.'

1032
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:36,055
'Don't change the channel.'

1033
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:39,592
'Keep watching. 'Kaha Suni.'

1034
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:52,743
Has anyone seen my glasses?
- How long will you take?

1035
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:55,016
ls it my fault we live in this
tiny flat with only one bathroom?

1036
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:57,547
lt's such a small house...

1037
00:55:57,654 --> 00:55:59,952
...four people live in it,
and no one has seen my glasses.

1038
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:01,750
Check in the pants
you wore yesterday.

1039
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:04,220
'Life went back to normal.'

1040
00:56:04,594 --> 00:56:06,562
'By the next morning,
we had all forgotten...'

1041
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:08,153
'...about Farooqi
Uncle's car's incident.'

1042
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:10,633
'But Papa made us
remember it all over again.'

1043
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:13,034
Now l remember! God help us!

1044
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,304
l left my glasses in Farooqi's car.

1045
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:18,969
Deepu! Payal!

1046
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:21,305
Go get my glasses
from Farooqi's house.

1047
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:23,841
Gotta rush. Test today.
- l will miss my bus.

1048
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,114
No one is willing to help me?

1049
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:28,045
Now chill.

1050
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:29,709
We've been
insulted enough yesterday.

1051
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,312
You don't go to their house either.

1052
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:33,589
Better if you buy new specs. Please.

1053
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:36,115
More damage!

1054
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:15,024
Don't tell your wife about it.

1055
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:17,155
My wife will come to know.

1056
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:18,691
She is insisting...

1057
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:20,827
...on not returning your
glasses till the car is repaired.

1058
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:25,036
l must thank your wife, Farooqi.

1059
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:27,176
lf she hadn't created the ruckus...

1060
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:30,244
...l would have never had
the courage to buy a car.

1061
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,307
So which one are you going to buy?

1062
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:34,650
Babu, your mechanic, was saying...

1063
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:35,911
...that he will get me
a nice second-hand car.

1064
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:37,043
Second-hand?!
- Yes.

1065
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:40,651
Duggal, don't go for
a second-hand. -Why?

1066
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,385
Banks don't sanction loans
easily for a second-hand car.

1067
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:47,060
Moreover, they will
charge double interest.

1068
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:51,799
lt's a car-engine, not
an algebra equation...

1069
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:52,925
...that you will be
able to figure it.

1070
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,871
lt will work fine during the trial.

1071
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:59,937
Afterwards, it will be stuck
in the garage with the mechanic.

1072
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:02,268
Really?
- Drop the idea.

1073
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:04,346
No, no. l have made up my mind.

1074
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:06,406
Where will you get the money?

1075
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:09,214
lt's no use buying
a second-hand car.

1076
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,343
You cannot afford a new one.

1077
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:11,818
''Are you back with the milk?!''

1078
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:13,013
Oh no!

1079
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:29,100
Payal, come on. l will drop you.

1080
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:31,296
Papa, you carry on!

1081
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,032
Just listen to me...

1082
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,375
Papa, how many
times have l told you..

1083
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:38,379
...not to ask me to ride on
the scooter. l will take the bus.

1084
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:40,381
There is only one or two
weeks left before the car comes.

1085
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:42,980
Then you won't get a
chance to sit on the jumbo-jet.

1086
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:44,983
You go on yourjumbo-jet.

1087
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,050
You don't believe that
l'll get the car, do you?

1088
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:50,325
When the car is delivered,
parked in front of our house...

1089
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:51,916
...then l will believe it.

1090
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:53,320
For now, please leave.

1091
00:58:54,497 --> 00:59:00,402
Okay. Fine. Off l go
on my vehicle...!!!

1092
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:02,397
Like the car will ever be bought!

1093
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:11,077
Stylish, smart, safe, value
for money and lndian, sir.

1094
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:13,944
Sit in the car, get a feel.
You will look ten years younger.

1095
00:59:14,183 --> 00:59:15,275
You will look 50.

1096
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,888
l am 51 .
- Really, sir?

1097
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:20,148
You look 41 .

1098
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,155
Actually l was looking
for that one... - That one!

1099
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:25,955
The complete family car, sir.

1100
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:28,154
Spacious, luxurious, hassle free...

1101
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:30,164
...value for money and lndian, sir.

1102
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:32,494
On-road Rs.338,000 only, sir.

1103
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:36,366
What happened, sir? Any problem?

1104
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:37,830
There is no problem.

1105
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:43,167
Don't you have a Nano? Nano?

1106
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,107
lt's a nice car.

1107
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:49,308
Their showroom is right next door.

1108
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:50,509
Join the long queue
to register for Nano.

1109
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:54,119
Your turn will come in a
year or two. - A year or two?!

1110
00:59:54,824 --> 00:59:59,852
No, l want a car in 15 days.
Okay don't you have...

1111
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:03,797
Maruti 800
- 800, sir!

1112
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:04,924
800.
- This way ...

1113
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:06,058
Good choice 800, even now it's
every neighbour's envy..

1114
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:07,193
..every owner's pride.

1115
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:08,793
But soon 800 will be history.

1116
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:12,806
What if l get you an
Alto for the price of 800?

1117
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,411
Alto for the price of 800?!

1118
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:18,140
Rohan Motors brings a
special scheme, sir.

1119
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:19,407
Dealer's discount. Free insurance.

1120
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:21,005
And accessories worth Rs.5,000.

1121
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:24,951
Only for you. But only
till the 31st. - 31st?!

1122
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,820
Just five days left to 31st.

1123
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:29,481
That's why don't delay,
just drive it.

1124
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:31,884
You will yourself say, Alto.

1125
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:35,022
Payal will drive, not me.

1126
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,292
Payal?
- Payal is my daughter.

1127
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,491
Your daughter.
- Yes.

1128
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:40,296
So you'd like to test
drive with your family? - Yes.

1129
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,301
No issues, sir. l will come
to your house with the car.

1130
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:44,838
You will bring the car to my house?!

1131
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:46,499
Of course, sir. You
leave your address with us.

1132
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:48,440
l will come to your
house with the car.

1133
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:50,844
Thank you for your assistance.
- Sure sir.

1134
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:51,971
Thank you.

1135
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:56,108
Alto. No way.
- lt's no ordinary car.

1136
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,317
lt's better than a Maruti 800.

1137
01:00:58,888 --> 01:01:01,322
We don't want better,
we want the best.

1138
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,186
Mickey's car is the best.

1139
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:04,850
Mickey's car costs
90,000 more than Alto.

1140
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:08,328
lPL, you shut up. - Where will
we get the extra 90,000 from?

1141
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:10,932
Good enough that we are
somehow managing to buy a car.

1142
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:13,195
She is never happy. Sourpuss!

1143
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:15,862
Yay! Papa is buying a bullock-cart.

1144
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:16,996
Everybody clap!

1145
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:18,130
Kusum, talk some sense
into her, or else...

1146
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:20,937
l will die, but l
won't ever sit in that car.

1147
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:22,602
Yes, don't.
- Yes, l won't.

1148
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:27,144
You never should.
- l will not!

1149
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:32,945
Ready for test drive?

1150
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:36,153
Alto?
- Alto!

1151
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:40,890
Wonderful. No, you drive.

1152
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:42,427
We will test it from the backseat.

1153
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:48,233
Buzz off Alto!

1154
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:54,235
Come on Payal . Come down.

1155
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:57,912
Okay, then we are going. Bye! Bye!

1156
01:02:05,955 --> 01:02:07,650
Strange kids you have, Kusum.

1157
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:11,923
First time we go for a test-drive,
one is sulking upstairs...

1158
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:15,930
...the other one went
off to sleep. Get up.

1159
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:19,195
Please confirm it.
- lt's final.

1160
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:22,396
l will prepare the papers
and call you. - Okay, sir.

1161
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,331
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1162
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:29,341
Yes!!
- Argh!

1163
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:33,080
'Mummy had sulked when
the cooler was bought. '

1164
01:02:33,316 --> 01:02:34,681
'Deepu sulked when we got the TV.'

1165
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,344
'And Papa... when we
bought the fridge.'

1166
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:40,087
'Now, that we are buying a car,
it's my turn to sulk.'

1167
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:45,950
'Whenever something new
is bought in our house...'

1168
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:48,154
'...invariably one
of us has to sulk.'

1169
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:52,162
l love you. l love you. l love you.

1170
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:53,963
l love you. l love you.
- We too have an Alto.

1171
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:55,628
Mom uses it for veggie-shopping.

1172
01:02:56,005 --> 01:02:57,097
Veggies!

1173
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:59,503
lt's cool to go on a date too.

1174
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:01,702
Payal dude!

1175
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:03,977
Oh wow!

1176
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:10,452
Oh wow! Oh wow! Oh wow!

1177
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:13,181
Where did you get so much money?
Did your parents buy it for you?

1178
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:14,582
My parents!

1179
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:16,989
They have never even
bought a car for themselves...

1180
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:18,583
...how will they buy one for me?

1181
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:20,186
Monthly installments...

1182
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:22,059
...from my own
hard-earned call-centre salary.

1183
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:24,656
l too want a call centre salary.

1184
01:03:24,767 --> 01:03:26,598
Then come along...
you too can get a job.

1185
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:28,467
ls it that easy?

1186
01:03:28,571 --> 01:03:31,005
Yup... walk-in interview,
walk outjob.

1187
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:36,075
'AllMS to llT. AllMS to Airport.
AllMS to Lodhi Road.'

1188
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:37,669
'The traffic is
flying on these flyovers.'

1189
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:40,408
'But its
slow-moving at Pahardganj...'

1190
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:42,279
'because the cops have
raided a hotel here... '

1191
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:45,013
'...to arrest Betting King Kumar.'

1192
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:47,021
Sandy. - Shut up. - 'The
cops have found phone numbers...

1193
01:03:47,123 --> 01:03:49,148
...which will lead them to
other betting-ring members. '

1194
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:50,555
Stop. Stop.
- Why stop?

1195
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,025
Stop the rickshaw.
- 'And the police is looking for...

1196
01:03:52,128 --> 01:03:54,653
...the rest of the gang members...'
- Stop the rickshaw!'

1197
01:03:56,432 --> 01:03:58,662
Sandy. Listen, Sandy.

1198
01:03:58,768 --> 01:04:00,201
Stop it, Sandy.

1199
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:01,964
Sandy, you are a psycho.

1200
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:03,062
Stop it, Sandy.

1201
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:09,144
Sandy don't break your phone,
your parents will scold you.

1202
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:10,336
What's wrong?

1203
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:15,350
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's get out of here!

1204
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:17,450
Go on, move... have
you also gone psycho!

1205
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:28,594
Stop.
- Let's go. - Stop! You witch!

1206
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:40,733
What nonsense.

1207
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:51,143
What happened?

1208
01:04:51,254 --> 01:04:52,278
Do you have to go to the loo?

1209
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:53,752
You had gone for your tuition,
hadn't you?

1210
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:57,283
Mr. Kumar didn't turn up?

1211
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:00,229
Did he ask for the tuition fee?

1212
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:03,289
Deepu, are you alright?

1213
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:05,823
Do you have fever? Let me check.

1214
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:07,294
Leave me alone!

1215
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:08,560
Then tell me what's wrong.

1216
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:09,763
l have a stomach ache. Let me sleep.

1217
01:05:09,872 --> 01:05:11,100
Whatever!

1218
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:33,258
Mummy! Papa! Who opened the lid?

1219
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:36,522
lnvolved in betting, are you?!
- No! No! No!

1220
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:38,259
Tell me where have
you hidden the money?

1221
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:43,129
Planning to buy an lPL team?
Want to become a millionaire?

1222
01:05:43,572 --> 01:05:44,596
Pull up your pants!

1223
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:52,805
Loser.

1224
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:04,616
Oh no.

1225
01:06:05,928 --> 01:06:07,555
Don't open the door.
- lt's Papa.

1226
01:06:08,597 --> 01:06:11,293
Come, come in.
- Why shouldn't she open the door?

1227
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:12,832
My dear, l am home.

1228
01:06:14,337 --> 01:06:15,497
Come on!
- Where?

1229
01:06:15,604 --> 01:06:16,764
Sit down. l have to tell
you something important.

1230
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:18,840
l am tired.

1231
01:06:19,608 --> 01:06:23,169
Papa, l have got a job.

1232
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:24,303
Job?

1233
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:25,710
Yes a job!
- Deepu... where are you going?

1234
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:27,578
The fish!
- Sit down.

1235
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:28,774
l will give you something to eat.

1236
01:06:28,884 --> 01:06:30,647
Payal Duggal got a job.

1237
01:06:30,886 --> 01:06:33,320
Starting salary is 10,000.

1238
01:06:33,556 --> 01:06:35,786
And after three months, 25,000.

1239
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:37,188
Per month?
- Per month.

1240
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,657
Call centre ... what is this?

1241
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:42,857
She had gone to a call centre
where her friend Geetu works.

1242
01:06:43,232 --> 01:06:45,200
Walk-in interview,
walk out with a job!

1243
01:06:45,301 --> 01:06:46,859
Deepu! Where are you going?

1244
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:48,334
They are hungry.
- You sit down. l'll feed the fish.

1245
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:50,738
Now, with your salary
and mine put together..

1246
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,671
we can buy the car of my choice.

1247
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:54,875
That's good! Very good!

1248
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:57,403
Work all night...

1249
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:58,939
...dark-circles under your eyes...

1250
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:00,612
...face all worn out...

1251
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,410
...you will look
35 at the age of 25.

1252
01:07:03,586 --> 01:07:04,610
Good!

1253
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:07,746
Then we won't need to worry
about your marriage expenses.

1254
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,220
lsn't that why you are so
happy, Kusum?

1255
01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:12,760
Nobody will agree to marry her.

1256
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:15,695
Go on, you make your
plan to buy the car.

1257
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:18,300
You are saying no, Papa?

1258
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:20,963
You are saying no, Papa!

1259
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:22,562
What's wrong with that?

1260
01:07:22,738 --> 01:07:24,638
Everyone's working in
call centres these days.

1261
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:26,434
'Cause if she works
at a call centre...

1262
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:28,635
...all her life she will be saying,
'How can l help you?..'

1263
01:07:28,744 --> 01:07:31,235
'Sorry for the inconvenience.'

1264
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:34,914
Hundreds of them start
everyday and as many shut down!

1265
01:07:39,422 --> 01:07:43,449
Look dear, if you don't
have a degree in hand...

1266
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:45,986
...you won't get a job in any
place other than a call centre.

1267
01:07:47,296 --> 01:07:50,663
First you finish your B.Sc.
then do an MBA.

1268
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,595
Then you think about doing a job.

1269
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:56,531
Fine! Fine!

1270
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:57,663
Thank you.

1271
01:07:57,773 --> 01:08:00,401
Papa you are so...

1272
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:02,272
l know Papa so bad,
Mamma so good ...

1273
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:03,402
We know that.

1274
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:07,473
What the ..! What is this?

1275
01:08:07,983 --> 01:08:09,280
So much money?

1276
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:14,280
My dear, now that's
very shrewd of you!

1277
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:15,481
What have l done now?

1278
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:16,888
All this saving!

1279
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,826
We can pay the down
payment for the car with this.

1280
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:22,295
Not mine... l keep my
savings in the rice-box.

1281
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:26,425
Deepu?

1282
01:08:28,337 --> 01:08:30,362
l was about to flush
all the money, Papa.

1283
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:32,564
Please, save me. l am very sorry.

1284
01:08:32,741 --> 01:08:34,709
Police will come and arrest me.

1285
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:36,777
Hang on! l don't understand!

1286
01:08:36,879 --> 01:08:37,903
What did you say?

1287
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:39,037
Papa!

1288
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:46,785
'Betting King Kumar.'

1289
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:54,591
'This brute trapped
innocent children.'

1290
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:58,331
'Who are the parents
of these children...'

1291
01:08:58,434 --> 01:09:01,870
'...who let their
innocent kids get trapped?'

1292
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:05,340
'After the break,
we will show you...'

1293
01:09:05,574 --> 01:09:09,408
'...the extensive
network of this criminal.'

1294
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:10,536
'Don't move.'

1295
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:13,473
Oh, my God. l don't believe this.

1296
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:15,010
You idiot. You moron...

1297
01:09:15,584 --> 01:09:16,608
l don't know him.

1298
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:18,546
ls this what you
have learnt at school?

1299
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:19,811
You punish him.

1300
01:09:19,922 --> 01:09:21,355
You beat him up.

1301
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:22,548
Calm down. Calm down.

1302
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:25,759
First we have to get
rid of this money.

1303
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:31,497
Deepu, this is a lot of money!

1304
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:39,835
'Papa got on the scooter and
made Deepu sit behind him...'

1305
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,034
'...and quietly left
with the betting money.'

1306
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:45,039
'Deepu was a nervous wreck! '

1307
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:47,449
'Scared, about the
punishment Papa would give him.'

1308
01:09:47,616 --> 01:09:49,379
''Papa made Deepu
distribute every single penny..

1309
01:09:49,485 --> 01:09:51,646
..of the betting money
among the street children.

1310
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:54,723
That's Papa! He is weird,
his punishments are weirder!''

1311
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:55,847
l've given away all
the betting money.

1312
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:56,982
Give me some for that kid.

1313
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:02,596
Hey! That's a 100-rupee bill!

1314
01:10:03,432 --> 01:10:04,456
Bye.

1315
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:09,861
Let's go!
- Bye.

1316
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,065
Are you still scared?

1317
01:10:13,442 --> 01:10:15,410
No. Now l'm hungry.

1318
01:10:18,647 --> 01:10:20,672
She just kept screaming 'psycho'!

1319
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:23,545
She was after my money...
not a real girlfriend.

1320
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:25,954
Why are you sad?

1321
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:27,547
That was just a rehearsal.

1322
01:10:27,656 --> 01:10:28,816
You'll finally get
a real girlfriend.

1323
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:30,488
But at the right time.

1324
01:10:32,127 --> 01:10:34,027
You didn't scold me even once, Papa.

1325
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:39,429
lt was my mistake.
Why should l scold you?

1326
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:42,894
l didn't even realize when
you grew up, and became Sandy.

1327
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:46,441
l didn't even know you
have a girlfriend...

1328
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:48,100
...until recently you
were sucking your fingers.

1329
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:49,438
Papa!

1330
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:52,839
We would apply bitter
oil on your fingers.

1331
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,573
..bitter-gourd water...

1332
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:58,117
...and once, we even
tried chilli powder.

1333
01:10:58,621 --> 01:10:59,645
But you still wouldn't stop.

1334
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:04,116
You would cry, wash your hands
and carry on sucking your fingers.

1335
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:07,653
Then one day...

1336
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:13,193
...you just gave up on your own.

1337
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:18,130
Now tell me, what do
we do about betting?

1338
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:21,736
Oil? Bitterjuice? Chilli powder?

1339
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:24,074
Or you will give up on your own?

1340
01:11:30,519 --> 01:11:32,612
l am sorry, Papa. Very sorry.

1341
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:37,492
Two cheese parathas... two potato...
two egg, two cauliflower...

1342
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:38,685
...two mince parathas...
takeaway! Here's your change.

1343
01:11:38,927 --> 01:11:41,088
Come on people, don'tjust keep
hogging, pay for your food. Pay up.

1344
01:11:46,001 --> 01:11:48,697
Deepu was hungry so we
stopped to eat parathas.

1345
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:50,698
Yes, we are coming.

1346
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:52,564
Yes, everything is fine.

1347
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:53,699
Let me drive...

1348
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:54,833
No you can't... lt takes time. l...

1349
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:56,706
Papa please
- All right!

1350
01:11:57,546 --> 01:11:58,570
Yes, on the way.

1351
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:00,975
Sulking won't fill her stomach.

1352
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:05,514
Tell her l am getting
cheese parathas for her.

1353
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:06,645
Careful!

1354
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:08,516
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

1355
01:12:08,624 --> 01:12:10,057
The car of my choice.

1356
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:11,922
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

1357
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:13,585
The car of my choice.

1358
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:16,790
Yes we are buying the
car of your choice ..

1359
01:12:17,766 --> 01:12:22,863
...but you don't ever talk about
working until you finish your MBA.

1360
01:12:23,038 --> 01:12:24,733
Promise?
- Promise!

1361
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:29,544
Not even once. - Not even once!
- Good girl. Hey wait!

1362
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:33,748
These documents
are for the car loan.

1363
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,674
Drop them off after college. Okay?
- Okay.

1364
01:12:36,785 --> 01:12:37,809
Hang on!

1365
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,547
There are originals too,
for verification...

1366
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:41,953
...don't lose them. Be careful.
- Okay.

1367
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:43,217
Oh yeah. Oh yeah

1368
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:47,227
We started with the car at 2,500
per month installment... - Yes.

1369
01:12:47,596 --> 01:12:49,621
Then we jumped to 3,400.

1370
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:52,026
Now it's a leap to 3,800!

1371
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,760
Only 1 ,000 extra will
be deducted every month.

1372
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:57,098
And the down payment? That
has sky-rocketed as well.

1373
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,173
l will swing it...

1374
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:01,098
You earn! You splurge!

1375
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:03,771
This is hardly splurging...

1376
01:13:04,613 --> 01:13:09,983
After the Betting Kumar incident,
l have learnt a lesson.

1377
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:15,916
Just paying the school fees
does not make me a good father.

1378
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:20,051
A father's duty is to
make his kids happy.

1379
01:13:20,763 --> 01:13:22,924
And in that, there
should be no discount!

1380
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:24,597
lt's my oil massage that
has made you so clever.

1381
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:25,792
You are spoiling my hair.

1382
01:13:26,034 --> 01:13:28,798
l have to ask for a loan from
the Principal and Bittoo Chatwal.

1383
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:32,202
Listen to me.Pay the fees by
tomorrow or else..

1384
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:34,136
Bittu sir.

1385
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:36,210
l need three months'
salary in advance.

1386
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:39,072
Advance? What advance?

1387
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:42,809
Sir, l need to buy a car.
- Hold your ears. Now do sit-ups!

1388
01:13:44,653 --> 01:13:45,677
Have you checked and
submitted the answer-sheets?

1389
01:13:45,988 --> 01:13:48,684
Just a few are left, Sir.
- Please work faster, Mr. Duggal.

1390
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:50,156
Sir, it'll be done by Monday.

1391
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:53,353
Sir, the advance payment...
- l said hold your ears!

1392
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:58,233
You earn such a
meager salary, Mr. Duggal.

1393
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,027
Three months'
advance is hardly enough.

1394
01:14:00,202 --> 01:14:01,692
Are you really going to break
your fixed deposit for the car?!

1395
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:04,034
Okay you'll work double-shifts to
pay for the monthly installments...

1396
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,968
...but what about the
down payment, Duggi!

1397
01:14:06,074 --> 01:14:07,701
You don't get it in private schools.

1398
01:14:08,076 --> 01:14:09,100
lf you wanted an advance payment..

1399
01:14:09,211 --> 01:14:10,235
...you should have gone
to a government school.

1400
01:14:10,345 --> 01:14:13,371
Duggi, all the funds
have already been budgeted.

1401
01:14:13,816 --> 01:14:15,181
You asked for a blackboard,
didn't you?

1402
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:16,308
l have approved it.

1403
01:14:16,418 --> 01:14:18,648
You're a senior teacher. We can
even bend the rules for you...

1404
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:20,915
...but sanctioning an advance
for a luxury item is not ethical.

1405
01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:23,651
lncome tax agents will
start making enquiries!

1406
01:14:23,759 --> 01:14:27,058
Any of your enemies, at
school or in the neighborhood...

1407
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:28,786
...will get a chance
to lodge a report.

1408
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:30,727
How did a teacher manage to
buy a car with his salary?

1409
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:32,733
You'll be stuck in
jail for 3-4 years.

1410
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:35,664
A teacher should not buy a car.

1411
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:36,863
Follow my advice...
buy a new scooter.

1412
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:39,667
And for that, start a double-shift
today itself. Cool then?

1413
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:40,799
So what if you're a teacher?

1414
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:42,068
Aren't you allowed
to have any desires?

1415
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:43,938
Aren't teachers allowed to
have any dreams, desires?

1416
01:14:44,446 --> 01:14:46,346
But you must not suffer in pain...

1417
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:48,279
...if some desires
cannot be fulfilled.

1418
01:14:49,184 --> 01:14:50,674
You must do power yoga.

1419
01:14:52,387 --> 01:14:54,014
Shouldn't you have first
figured out how will we get...

1420
01:14:54,122 --> 01:14:55,885
...the money for the down payment?

1421
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:57,686
l had.

1422
01:14:57,993 --> 01:15:00,689
l was confident that l'll
get my three months' salary...

1423
01:15:00,796 --> 01:15:03,162
...from the employers who l have
worked for for the last 20 years.

1424
01:15:03,265 --> 01:15:04,698
Oh, my God! Forget about
the car of my choice..

1425
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,290
..now we can't even get an Alto.

1426
01:15:06,802 --> 01:15:07,826
Why?

1427
01:15:07,936 --> 01:15:10,427
lf teachers can't
buy a car, then how...

1428
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:13,765
Who said teachers can't
buy a car? Who said that?

1429
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:17,444
l'll show you how a teacher can!

1430
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:20,114
l'm not a failure.

1431
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:24,317
Oh Charan! Come in. Got
all the detergent packets?

1432
01:15:24,753 --> 01:15:26,721
Counted them? One
thousand,aren't they?

1433
01:15:26,822 --> 01:15:27,914
What's all this?

1434
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:32,058
Car! Car!

1435
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:38,393
Third Prize food-processor! Second
Prize home-theatre! First Prize car!

1436
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:42,259
Cut the packets. Pull out the slip.

1437
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:44,737
Look for the first prize car.
We will win a car!

1438
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:50,277
''When the iron is red hot''

1439
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:53,871

''Two twos are Four!
Two twos are Four! ''

1451
01:16:53,842 --> 01:16:55,241
''Think wisely, Be careful.''

1452
01:16:55,344 --> 01:16:57,141
''See properly,''

1453
01:16:57,245 --> 01:16:58,269
''You might get lucky.''

1454
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:00,280
''Take a chance''

1455
01:17:00,382 --> 01:17:01,406
''Roll the dice''

1456
01:17:01,516 --> 01:17:02,540
''Make your move''

1457
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:05,251
''Then wait and watch''

1458
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:07,822

''Go on, fry your dreams.''

1474
01:17:57,906 --> 01:17:59,874
Even if we don't win a prize, at
least we will have enough stocks...

1475
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:02,535
...for the entire
neighborhood to wash clothes...

1476
01:18:09,918 --> 01:18:10,942
Last one.

1477
01:18:12,054 --> 01:18:14,079
lt's the last one! Wake up gang!

1478
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:15,213
The last one!

1479
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:17,152
Yes. Who's going to cut it?

1480
01:18:17,259 --> 01:18:19,352
My hands are shivering.
- You cut it.

1481
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:20,485
Not me.

1482
01:18:20,595 --> 01:18:23,291
Till now l haven't won a single
prize in the thousand packets...

1483
01:18:23,398 --> 01:18:24,422
Give it to me.
- l'll cut it!

1484
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:27,434
l haven't won till now cause l am
destined to win the first prize car.

1485
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:29,299
Sit down. Now sit down.

1486
01:18:31,473 --> 01:18:33,031
Hang on! One sec!

1487
01:19:20,989 --> 01:19:23,549
l had even applied
probability to calculate

1488
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:26,352
that out of the 1 ,000 packets,
even if we don't win a car...

1489
01:19:26,461 --> 01:19:28,486
...surely we would win an expensive
prize which we could have sold...

1490
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:32,233
...to get the cash
for the down payment.

1491
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,494
l knew we wouldn't get a carjust
by cutting the detergent packets.

1492
01:19:37,005 --> 01:19:39,030
You won't even let me
take up the call centre job!

1493
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:40,165
Hey!

1494
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:43,309
Don't start playing the
call centre tune again!

1495
01:19:43,411 --> 01:19:45,971
l'm going to sleep.
Don't wake me up.

1496
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:48,982
Yes! Go to sleep!
- You forced me to quit my job.

1497
01:19:49,084 --> 01:19:50,449
Now you're not
even letting her work.

1498
01:19:50,552 --> 01:19:53,453
You don't have to take on
all the responsibilities.

1499
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,180
Let Payal work.

1500
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:58,191
Give me the telephone
number for Charan's shop.

1501
01:19:58,426 --> 01:20:01,657
lt'll take us two
months to repay this debt.

1502
01:20:02,497 --> 01:20:04,055
l won't let you push
us into any more losses.

1503
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:05,390
Fine, l'll get the number myself.

1504
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,196
l'm not a failure! Remember that!

1505
01:20:08,436 --> 01:20:10,529
Call centre, huh!

1506
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:12,529
l'm not a failure!

1507
01:20:13,708 --> 01:20:15,335
lt's not a joke to
be a Math teacher!

1508
01:20:17,379 --> 01:20:20,473
Where's my diary?
Where's this Charan?

1509
01:20:21,249 --> 01:20:22,273
Here it is!

1510
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:26,485
Why is the diary all tattered?!

1511
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:36,688
Kusum!

1512
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:41,097
Why did l make the promise
to Urmi in the first place?!

1513
01:20:41,536 --> 01:20:44,164
l have told everybody at the
college we are buying a car.

1514
01:20:44,472 --> 01:20:47,305
The prize is in one of
the answer sheets...

1515
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:48,433
...and like a fool, l have
been searching for it..

1516
01:20:48,543 --> 01:20:49,567
..in detergent packets!

1517
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:51,043
Do you remember the
roll number of the one...

1518
01:20:51,146 --> 01:20:52,579
...who was willing to
pay 1 ,000 for one mark?

1519
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:57,510
Will you make the call?
- Yes. Do you remember the number?

1520
01:20:57,686 --> 01:21:00,587
Of course l do. His birthday!

1521
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:08,391
1st March, '93. 1 ...3...9...3! 1393!

1522
01:21:08,563 --> 01:21:10,656
Brilliant! You should have
been a Math teacher, dear!

1523
01:21:11,299 --> 01:21:14,063
1393... - Fine, don't
tell me any of your secrets!

1524
01:21:14,169 --> 01:21:19,471
1393. Don't get hassled!
Here read this.

1525
01:21:19,574 --> 01:21:22,065
Dear sir, please
give me passing marks,

1526
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:25,669
my dad will pay...
thousand for each mark... Oh yeah!

1527
01:21:27,249 --> 01:21:28,341
What are you doing?

1528
01:21:28,516 --> 01:21:30,143
Changing my voice to ask for money.

1529
01:21:30,652 --> 01:21:31,676
Don't do that!

1530
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,220
Why? - Your number will
still be displayed and traced!

1531
01:21:35,123 --> 01:21:36,681
Call from the PCO, at lTO.

1532
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:41,356
From the PCO at lTO...
- You're right!

1533
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:44,291
l'll go change.
Kusum, cup of tea please!

1534
01:21:50,872 --> 01:21:53,705
Listen, are you sure we're
not doing something wrong?

1535
01:21:55,877 --> 01:21:57,640
l'm not giving him 100 out of 100.

1536
01:21:58,546 --> 01:21:59,843
l'm just giving him passing marks.

1537
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:05,250
And anyway, whether
1393 passes or fails...

1538
01:22:06,354 --> 01:22:08,185
...he's going to enjoy
life with his father's money.

1539
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:11,657
But my children will
be stuck with a scooter.

1540
01:22:16,164 --> 01:22:18,655
Those who have been taught
by me... Engineers, MBAs...

1541
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:22,596
...earn starting
salaries of 150,000.

1542
01:22:24,172 --> 01:22:29,405
l'm 51 , but l don't
even have a dinky car.

1543
01:22:31,179 --> 01:22:33,147
There are flyovers
being built everywhere.

1544
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:35,147
All of Delhi is
furiously moving ahead...

1545
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:36,274
...like the Metro...

1546
01:22:36,384 --> 01:22:37,408
...but we are stuck
where we've always been.

1547
01:22:39,921 --> 01:22:41,684
Everyone is buying cars...

1548
01:22:42,924 --> 01:22:44,619
...but if a teacher's
family wishes to buy one...

1549
01:22:45,327 --> 01:22:46,817
...then we are
questioned a hundred questions.

1550
01:22:48,396 --> 01:22:49,829
Why shouldn't we have a car?

1551
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:52,359
No. We're not doing anything wrong!

1552
01:22:53,201 --> 01:22:55,169
And don't feel
guilty even for a second!

1553
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:56,294
Why would l feel guilty?

1554
01:22:56,404 --> 01:22:57,632
...l just asked to make sure...

1555
01:22:57,739 --> 01:22:59,297
...you are not doing
this under any pressure.

1556
01:22:59,407 --> 01:23:00,431
l've been to the toilet
early in morning.

1557
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:01,566
Why would l now feel any pressure?

1558
01:23:06,214 --> 01:23:08,512
Yes? Santosh Duggal this side.

1559
01:23:10,218 --> 01:23:11,378
Yes, we're buying a car.

1560
01:23:12,354 --> 01:23:13,378
We'll need a loan too.

1561
01:23:15,223 --> 01:23:16,588
Where did you get my number from?

1562
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:21,853
Okay. No, l'm going out for
something important right now.

1563
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:25,197
No, after my work is done.
Call me up in the evening.

1564
01:23:25,633 --> 01:23:27,863
Mention not. Many thanks.

1565
01:23:29,637 --> 01:23:31,537
Offering a car loan.

1566
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,865
With it a credit card too! Free!

1567
01:23:34,376 --> 01:23:37,402
You are my hero! Best of luck!

1568
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:41,281
My 1 ...3...9...3, happy birthday!

1569
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:45,214
Good luck, Payal! Good luck!

1570
01:23:47,389 --> 01:23:49,482
''The sea's bullying.''

1571
01:23:50,658 --> 01:23:53,218
''Makes the bubbles angry.''

1572
01:23:54,329 --> 01:23:55,762
''The sea counts cash.''

1573
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:57,729
''While the bubbles remain paupers.''

1574
01:23:57,832 --> 01:24:00,699
''Oh the sea's bullying!''

1575
01:24:01,269 --> 01:24:04,534
''Without the madness''

1576
01:24:04,839 --> 01:24:06,636
''Without a goal''

1577
01:24:06,741 --> 01:24:08,368
''There's no excitement
Life is a big hole.''

1578
01:24:08,476 --> 01:24:09,943
''Tighten your pyjamas.''

1579
01:24:10,278 --> 01:24:11,711
''Pull up your pants.''

1580
01:24:11,813 --> 01:24:13,678
'' Go bust the sea''

1581
01:24:13,782 --> 01:24:15,409
''Make its life hell!.''

1582
01:24:15,517 --> 01:24:17,417
''Two twos are Four!
Two twos are Four! ''

1583
01:24:17,519 --> 01:24:19,248
''By hook or crook you have to score''

1584
01:24:19,354 --> 01:24:20,821
''Two twos are Four!
Two twos are Four! ''

1585
01:24:22,624 --> 01:24:24,421

Two twos are Four! ''

1586
01:24:24,526 --> 01:24:26,255
''By hook or crook you have to score''

1587
01:24:26,361 --> 01:24:28,261
''Two twos are Four!
Two twos are Four! ''

1588
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:09,302
Phone! Phone!
- Who could it be now? Hello.

1589
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:13,438
Yes, l will need a loan, but
please call me in the evening.

1590
01:25:13,608 --> 01:25:14,700
l'm kind of busy right now.

1591
01:25:14,809 --> 01:25:16,902
Papa. Let's go!
- Yes, l am.

1592
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:26,718
Anyone will suspect us if we
sit with just a glass of water.

1593
01:25:27,755 --> 01:25:29,780
Do one thing, order
the non-veg burger.

1594
01:25:29,891 --> 01:25:30,915
Non-veg?!

1595
01:25:31,025 --> 01:25:32,583
We are going to get 60,000,
aren't we?

1596
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:34,326
We'll get some
non-veg stuff packed for...

1597
01:25:34,429 --> 01:25:36,727
...Mummy and Deepu as well,
on our way back.

1598
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:38,728
Why did you ask for 60,000 only?

1599
01:25:39,634 --> 01:25:42,000
lf l had asked for 100,000, would
it have taken care of all our needs?

1600
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:43,860
l just asked for
what we require now.

1601
01:25:46,374 --> 01:25:48,934
We'll sit at different tables.
- Why?

1602
01:25:49,511 --> 01:25:51,342
What if he gets jittery
seeing an extra person?

1603
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:53,743
He didn't come across
as the jittery type.

1604
01:25:53,848 --> 01:25:54,872
Even then...

1605
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:57,008
Hello.

1606
01:25:57,785 --> 01:25:59,343
Yes, l do need a loan,
but l told you...

1607
01:25:59,454 --> 01:26:00,478
...to call me in the evening.

1608
01:26:00,788 --> 01:26:02,881
Yes, thank you. These bankers...
Your phone.

1609
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:05,683
Yes, Mummy?

1610
01:26:05,927 --> 01:26:07,485
No, we're at McDonald's.

1611
01:26:08,463 --> 01:26:10,363
Don'tjust keep
calling every minute, dude.

1612
01:26:10,532 --> 01:26:12,500
No, l'll call you
when everything is done.

1613
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:14,628
No, l don't want to talk to Deepu.
- Why? No.

1614
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:18,638
Payal! Payal! - Give it to me.
Hello, Payal. Payal! Moron!

1615
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:19,764
She hung up?

1616
01:26:20,408 --> 01:26:23,377
You're so intelligent.
How could you let them go?

1617
01:26:23,945 --> 01:26:25,572
Just watch this.

1618
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,375
'lt may seem like patients
are given treatment here,

1619
01:26:27,482 --> 01:26:28,506
that diseases are cured...

1620
01:26:28,616 --> 01:26:30,584
...but hidden behind the spotless
clinic walls is an ugly reality.'

1621
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:32,380
They conduct stings all day.

1622
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:36,115
This is a doctor's sting operation!

1623
01:26:36,424 --> 01:26:38,119
There are army stings, actor
stings, politician stings!

1624
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:40,585
Papa got me out of
the betting mess,

1625
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:43,391
..but now he has got
into one himself...

1626
01:26:43,498 --> 01:26:44,658
they will just chew him up...

1627
01:26:44,899 --> 01:26:49,734
'And infiltrated the clinic of
this killer for a Sting Operation!'

1628
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:51,596
There hasn't been a sting
conducted on teachers as yet.

1629
01:26:56,844 --> 01:26:57,868
l'm going.

1630
01:26:59,714 --> 01:27:03,411
l have a very bad feeling. Deepu!

1631
01:27:04,519 --> 01:27:06,419
'Look at this man's innocent face.'

1632
01:27:06,521 --> 01:27:08,682
'Don't go by the innocence. '

1633
01:27:08,856 --> 01:27:13,691
'Behind this face is a
dangerous criminal!'

1634
01:27:24,872 --> 01:27:27,033
Chattar, Negi. Stay at the gate!

1635
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:30,435
Papa, burger. Papa, burger.

1636
01:27:30,545 --> 01:27:32,103
Mr. Duggal.
- Papa, burger.

1637
01:27:32,213 --> 01:27:33,441
Mr. Duggal.
- Make this moron shut up!

1638
01:27:33,548 --> 01:27:35,982
They're here.
- Where? Where?

1639
01:27:36,818 --> 01:27:38,979
Chill. Chill. Don't be scared.
l'm handling it, Papa.

1640
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:43,514
Good morning, sir!

1641
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:46,720
Sir! Good morning!

1642
01:27:46,894 --> 01:27:47,918
Who are you talking to?

1643
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:51,861
Teacher sir! Good morning, sir!

1644
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,468
ls he the teacher?
- Looks like him.

1645
01:27:54,569 --> 01:27:56,935
Quite a scoundrel.
He's called others too.

1646
01:27:58,506 --> 01:28:01,737
Sir, l've been
greeting you for so long.

1647
01:28:01,843 --> 01:28:03,071
Good morning.
- You're not listening to me.

1648
01:28:03,177 --> 01:28:06,738
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

1649
01:28:06,848 --> 01:28:08,145
You had called.

1650
01:28:08,249 --> 01:28:12,549
Oh, looks like there's a long
queue. We have to wait? - No... no.

1651
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:15,484
My work is done. - Thank you
for saving my son's future.

1652
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:18,684
l said call me in the evening, l
am in the middle of another meeting.

1653
01:28:21,663 --> 01:28:22,823
You look very busy!

1654
01:28:22,997 --> 01:28:24,897
l spoke to just one man.

1655
01:28:24,999 --> 01:28:26,091
He's my father.

1656
01:28:27,735 --> 01:28:29,498
Sit, Father. You sit.
- Get lost!

1657
01:28:29,604 --> 01:28:30,696
Give the chair, or
l will thrash you?!

1658
01:28:30,805 --> 01:28:34,571
He's my brother. We
are a business family.

1659
01:28:34,742 --> 01:28:36,710
All three of us go
together for every deal. - Yes.

1660
01:28:36,811 --> 01:28:39,575
l spoke to you.
- The student is my son.

1661
01:28:45,553 --> 01:28:46,781
And l'll see the answer-sheet.

1662
01:28:47,555 --> 01:28:49,113
Show me, how many
marks have you given him?

1663
01:28:55,897 --> 01:28:59,128
Aryan? Are you 1 ...3...9...3?

1664
01:28:59,567 --> 01:29:00,932
He is the one who has to
be given passing marks.

1665
01:29:01,169 --> 01:29:02,659
We brought him along...

1666
01:29:02,770 --> 01:29:04,533
...so that he can thank you.
- Yes.

1667
01:29:05,573 --> 01:29:07,200
Why thank him when we're paying?

1668
01:29:07,842 --> 01:29:10,208
Sir, you tell everyone in the
class not to eat pizzas and burgers.

1669
01:29:10,578 --> 01:29:11,602
Now you're eating it yourself?

1670
01:29:12,113 --> 01:29:14,138
Many other things are
said in the classroom.

1671
01:29:14,582 --> 01:29:17,016
Every word is not to be followed.

1672
01:29:17,118 --> 01:29:18,676
Come on, let's see the answer-sheet.

1673
01:29:21,589 --> 01:29:22,817
Mr. Duggal.

1674
01:29:24,592 --> 01:29:25,616
Duggal sir?

1675
01:29:27,061 --> 01:29:31,760
Zafar. Zafar lqbal, 1994 batch.

1676
01:29:33,601 --> 01:29:34,625
l was in your class.

1677
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:38,634
Bluffer?
- Sir, you knew our nicknames?!

1678
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:41,175
Just a second, sir.
Sabina. Asma, come here.

1679
01:29:42,009 --> 01:29:44,910
Sir, this is my wife Sabina
and she's my daughter Asma.

1680
01:29:45,613 --> 01:29:49,174
Duggal Express!
- Oh, my God! Duggal Express, sir!

1681
01:29:50,618 --> 01:29:51,915
He's my Math teacher.

1682
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:53,585
Did he teach you tables?

1683
01:29:53,688 --> 01:29:54,712
Not only tables...

1684
01:29:54,822 --> 01:29:57,723
...but also algebra, calculus...
he taught me to work hard.

1685
01:29:57,892 --> 01:29:59,723
He taught me not to
make silly mistakes.

1686
01:29:59,827 --> 01:30:01,920
He turned even a person
like me into a good boy.

1687
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:04,789
l also know tables.

1688
01:30:05,099 --> 01:30:06,191
Two ones are two,
two twos are four...

1689
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:08,268
...two threes are six,
two fours are...

1690
01:30:08,903 --> 01:30:11,269
Eight. Two fours are eight.
- Yes, eight.

1691
01:30:11,639 --> 01:30:13,607
Sir, do you remember Venky?

1692
01:30:14,242 --> 01:30:15,334
Venky...
- Venkatesh.

1693
01:30:16,644 --> 01:30:19,738
The one who wore 4.5...
- 4.5!

1694
01:30:19,914 --> 01:30:23,611
Sir, he's even started a blog
named Duggal Express. - Really?

1695
01:30:23,785 --> 01:30:25,275
He lives in New
York with his family.

1696
01:30:25,653 --> 01:30:28,087
We live there too, sir.
There are many others, sir.

1697
01:30:28,189 --> 01:30:29,622
Some from our school and some...

1698
01:30:29,724 --> 01:30:31,021
...from your old coaching classes.

1699
01:30:31,125 --> 01:30:33,889
Whenever we meet we
talk so much about you.

1700
01:30:34,662 --> 01:30:36,755
Zafar, l think we should leave.

1701
01:30:36,931 --> 01:30:40,025
Oh. Sorry, sir. You're busy.
Give me your number.

1702
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:42,634
l'll come over to
school to meet you. - Sure.

1703
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:44,837
Sir, is your scooter still working?

1704
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:46,831
You must have bought a car by now.

1705
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:50,244
No, l still have the scooter.
- You do!

1706
01:30:50,344 --> 01:30:52,710
The number of times
you have given us a lift.

1707
01:30:52,814 --> 01:30:54,714
Four of us on one scooter!

1708
01:30:55,349 --> 01:30:56,646
Thank you, sir.
- Shall we?

1709
01:30:56,951 --> 01:30:59,249
Sir, it was really great seeing you.

1710
01:31:00,087 --> 01:31:01,645
Come, dear.
- Bye!

1711
01:31:01,756 --> 01:31:03,724
Two ones are two,
two twos are four...

1712
01:31:03,825 --> 01:31:05,053
...two threes are six,
two fours are...

1713
01:31:05,159 --> 01:31:06,183
Two fours are eight.

1714
01:31:11,699 --> 01:31:13,792
ls the long-lost teacher
-student meeting over?

1715
01:31:14,769 --> 01:31:16,794
Now show the answer-sheet,
take your money so we can leave.

1716
01:31:22,043 --> 01:31:25,809
Payal...

1717
01:31:25,913 --> 01:31:28,006
We don't want their money!

1718
01:31:28,249 --> 01:31:30,410
lt's okay if we don't
buy a car. Let's go.

1719
01:31:30,718 --> 01:31:33,016
Who is she?
- My best student.

1720
01:31:33,721 --> 01:31:34,745
Best student... hah!

1721
01:31:34,856 --> 01:31:36,084
They want more money
'cause that ex-student..

1722
01:31:36,190 --> 01:31:37,214
..from New York has
done so much publicity.

1723
01:31:37,725 --> 01:31:39,955
lt's respect and not publicity.

1724
01:31:40,194 --> 01:31:43,027
You've come to buy marks.
You won't understand.

1725
01:31:43,197 --> 01:31:45,290
What's it got to do with you?
He is the one giving me marks.

1726
01:31:45,733 --> 01:31:47,963
lf l give you marks
that you don't deserve...

1727
01:31:48,069 --> 01:31:49,093
...then both of us will fail.

1728
01:31:49,203 --> 01:31:51,296
You'll give marks and we'll
give you money. No one fails.

1729
01:31:52,006 --> 01:31:55,908
You'll fail because you'll learn
that everything can be bought.

1730
01:31:56,744 --> 01:31:58,905
l'll fail because
when you grow up...

1731
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:01,180
...you'll remember
me for my dishonesty.

1732
01:32:03,017 --> 01:32:05,247
l want my students to
remember me only for...

1733
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:07,920
...something l taught them
and it helps them in life.

1734
01:32:08,890 --> 01:32:11,188
So that when they grow up,
they should introduce me as...

1735
01:32:11,292 --> 01:32:13,317
...''Duggal sir, the man who made
me a good boy or a good girl.''

1736
01:32:21,302 --> 01:32:22,326
And that means ..?

1737
01:32:22,436 --> 01:32:27,203
That means, he'll get
the marks that he deserves.

1738
01:32:27,909 --> 01:32:29,809
No more no less.

1739
01:32:29,911 --> 01:32:32,345
Hey, Teacher! Are you
done with your lecture?

1740
01:32:33,047 --> 01:32:34,480
Now tell me how much you
want to give him passing marks.

1741
01:32:36,918 --> 01:32:39,011
Stop him from playing
video games in class.

1742
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:41,753
He'll understand the
lessons and you won't have to...

1743
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:43,414
...crack any deals for him to pass.

1744
01:32:44,191 --> 01:32:46,352
And if he is again caught
with a Gameboy next time...

1745
01:32:47,061 --> 01:32:48,961
...then ask him not to
paint on my scooter.

1746
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:50,887
lt's a request.

1747
01:32:51,198 --> 01:32:54,292
He did that! You!

1748
01:32:54,802 --> 01:32:56,360
My son! My son!
- Papa!

1749
01:32:56,537 --> 01:32:57,765
My son!

1750
01:32:58,205 --> 01:33:02,039
What have you done?
Who do you think you are?

1751
01:33:04,211 --> 01:33:06,441
ldiots! Someone pick me up!

1752
01:33:06,881 --> 01:33:07,905
What does she think of herself?!

1753
01:33:28,970 --> 01:33:32,406
''Take it from one hand and
give it away from the other.''

1754
01:33:32,506 --> 01:33:35,998
''Take it from one hand and
give it away from the other.''

1755
01:33:36,377 --> 01:33:39,938
''Take it from one hand and
give it away from the other.''

1756
01:33:43,851 --> 01:33:45,409
''By hook or crook you have to score''

1757
01:33:47,254 --> 01:33:48,949
''Two twos are Four!
Two twos are Four! ''

1758
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:00,895
''Two twos are Four!
Two twos are Four! ''

1759
01:34:01,002 --> 01:34:02,902
''Two twos are Four!
Two twos are Four! ''

1760
01:34:36,637 --> 01:34:38,195
''By hook or crook you have to score''

1761
01:34:45,913 --> 01:34:47,938
''When the iron is red hot''

1762
01:34:49,316 --> 01:34:51,216
''Go on, strike!''

1763
01:34:53,054 --> 01:34:55,147
''When the oil of
dreams is on the boil''

1764
01:34:55,256 --> 01:34:58,225
''Go on, fry your dreams.''

1765
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:09,233
Keep coming... keep coming.

1766
01:35:09,336 --> 01:35:11,031
That's good. Stop!

1767
01:35:11,138 --> 01:35:13,163
Farooqi, the car looks
as good as brand new.

1768
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:15,304
Poor Duggal was put
through so much hassle.

1769
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:18,178
Your estimate was 5,000, but
it's all repaired within 3,000.

1770
01:35:18,279 --> 01:35:20,304
One must keep some margin.

1771
01:35:20,681 --> 01:35:22,512
Talk of the... Duggal here he is.

1772
01:35:22,616 --> 01:35:26,108
Duggal, you've made
a profit of 3,000.

1773
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:27,585
Please take your
balance money, Duggal.

1774
01:35:27,688 --> 01:35:30,521
l don't want any money.
l don't want it!

1775
01:35:30,624 --> 01:35:32,649
Looks like there's some big mess.

1776
01:35:33,627 --> 01:35:36,255
That's how they conduct stings.
So that everything seems normal.

1777
01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:39,260
The ones who he called his
father and brother were the cops.

1778
01:35:39,567 --> 01:35:41,592
Those who were standing at
the door were the cameramen.

1779
01:35:42,103 --> 01:35:43,127
They were shooting from far.

1780
01:35:43,237 --> 01:35:44,397
No, nothing will happen, Papa.

1781
01:35:44,505 --> 01:35:45,995
You didn't do anything.

1782
01:35:46,974 --> 01:35:48,407
l was about to take the money.

1783
01:35:48,509 --> 01:35:50,204
The camera must have covered that.

1784
01:35:50,311 --> 01:35:52,541
But you didn't take it, did you?
You did the right thing.

1785
01:35:52,646 --> 01:35:54,011
You can't be punished
for doing the right thing.

1786
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:56,482
Don't answer it, Papa!
Break it! Break the phone!

1787
01:35:57,318 --> 01:35:59,548
Calm down. lt's Farooqi.
Yes Farooqi?

1788
01:35:59,653 --> 01:36:01,621
Duggal, come to your balcony.
- Why?

1789
01:36:02,323 --> 01:36:04,223
Come on!
- Okay.

1790
01:36:05,059 --> 01:36:06,959
But what happened, Mr. Farooqi?

1791
01:36:07,061 --> 01:36:10,087
Come out.
- What's the matter?

1792
01:36:14,468 --> 01:36:16,436
Look at me, to your left.
Look to your left.

1793
01:36:16,537 --> 01:36:17,561
Yikes!

1794
01:36:17,671 --> 01:36:18,968
Where does the teacher stay?

1795
01:36:19,073 --> 01:36:20,973
Some people are
asking for your address.

1796
01:36:21,075 --> 01:36:23,236
l haven't given it.

1797
01:36:23,611 --> 01:36:24,635
They don't look like decent people.

1798
01:36:25,279 --> 01:36:26,303
What's the matter, Duggal?

1799
01:36:27,148 --> 01:36:30,982
l'm coming down.
- Quickly.

1800
01:36:31,085 --> 01:36:32,109
We're just asking you
where the teacher's house is.

1801
01:36:34,355 --> 01:36:39,190
Kaha Suni's dedicated viewers,
do look at him carefully!

1802
01:36:39,293 --> 01:36:41,523
He has humiliated knowledge!

1803
01:36:41,629 --> 01:36:43,597
He has disrespected education!

1804
01:36:43,697 --> 01:36:45,597
He has murdered books.

1805
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:49,467
With him is a
whole gang, his family.

1806
01:36:49,703 --> 01:36:51,603
Your husband and
father is being arrested!

1807
01:36:51,705 --> 01:36:53,468
Tell me, how do you feel? Tell me!

1808
01:36:55,042 --> 01:36:58,409
There is a beast hidden
behind this innocent face!

1809
01:36:58,512 --> 01:37:01,003
Just to buy a car
he sold his honesty.

1810
01:37:01,115 --> 01:37:02,480
l didn't take the cash.
l haven't taken the cash.

1811
01:37:03,584 --> 01:37:06,610
What's the matter? What's the
noise all about? - No don't...

1812
01:37:11,258 --> 01:37:12,282
Yes?

1813
01:37:12,793 --> 01:37:14,624
l do not want the loan!

1814
01:37:14,728 --> 01:37:17,094
l'm caught in a calamity, and all
you can think of is the car loan.

1815
01:37:17,264 --> 01:37:18,356
ldiot!

1816
01:37:21,068 --> 01:37:23,434
Look, l'll surrender.

1817
01:37:24,071 --> 01:37:26,301
The matter might get
solved if l talk to them.

1818
01:37:35,082 --> 01:37:36,640
You stay here. l'll talk to them.

1819
01:37:37,084 --> 01:37:40,645
Listen to me... please listen to me.

1820
01:37:40,754 --> 01:37:43,655
Who are you?
- l am his wife. lt's not his fault.

1821
01:37:44,158 --> 01:37:46,251
Whatever has happened
is all because of me.

1822
01:37:46,493 --> 01:37:49,519
l told him that we'll go to
Urmi's in-laws' place in a car.

1823
01:37:50,097 --> 01:37:51,462
l persuaded Mr. Farooqi too.

1824
01:37:51,699 --> 01:37:53,599
His tail-light broke because of me.

1825
01:37:53,701 --> 01:37:56,465
l pushed my husband
on the wrong path.

1826
01:37:56,770 --> 01:37:59,603
By God, he is innocent.

1827
01:37:59,773 --> 01:38:02,264
Madamji, what are you trying to say.

1828
01:38:02,376 --> 01:38:04,276
Please spare him. Please.

1829
01:38:04,578 --> 01:38:06,478
Sir, please don't give that
sting tape to any news channel.

1830
01:38:06,647 --> 01:38:08,080
But.. - Yes, we won't
do it again. Promise.

1831
01:38:08,182 --> 01:38:09,274
Please don't arrest him.

1832
01:38:09,383 --> 01:38:11,146
Why are you piling wrong
accusations on to us?!

1833
01:38:11,385 --> 01:38:13,080
l've told you so many times

1834
01:38:13,187 --> 01:38:14,279
to pull out the visiting
card when we meet strange

1835
01:38:16,523 --> 01:38:17,615
Yes. Here you go, madam.

1836
01:38:18,459 --> 01:38:21,485
Popley Sweets!
- Here. You also take one.

1837
01:38:22,529 --> 01:38:24,554
Do we look like cops?

1838
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:28,293
We've been running Popley Sweets
for the last three generations.

1839
01:38:29,603 --> 01:38:32,163
We make the best sweets.

1840
01:38:32,606 --> 01:38:35,575
No one in Delhi can
make them better than us.

1841
01:38:35,676 --> 01:38:38,167
Teacher, you also take my card.

1842
01:38:38,479 --> 01:38:40,310
Are you a Math teacher
or a Physical lnstructor?

1843
01:38:40,681 --> 01:38:42,706
Made me run around so much.

1844
01:38:43,284 --> 01:38:44,308
Come here, you moron.

1845
01:38:44,485 --> 01:38:47,113
Not you, send that
elder moron's son.

1846
01:38:47,421 --> 01:38:50,652
Touch his feet!
- Touch his feet!

1847
01:38:51,692 --> 01:38:54,593
Click a picture. Say sorry to him.

1848
01:38:55,162 --> 01:38:56,186
Sorry.

1849
01:38:56,297 --> 01:38:57,321
Get lost.

1850
01:38:58,232 --> 01:39:02,726
Never mind, Teacher. lt's okay.
Let my grandson fail.

1851
01:39:03,904 --> 01:39:06,270
But now you teach him so well...

1852
01:39:07,374 --> 01:39:09,137
so well... that he passes...

1853
01:39:09,243 --> 01:39:11,143
...the exams on his own.

1854
01:39:13,180 --> 01:39:15,341
Here. Here's the money.

1855
01:39:15,716 --> 01:39:17,411
12 months' payment in advance.

1856
01:39:19,186 --> 01:39:21,347
lt's not a bribe.
lt's your tuition fee.

1857
01:39:22,389 --> 01:39:25,620
No... the school pays me
a salary to teach him.

1858
01:39:25,726 --> 01:39:27,751
You don't have to be so honest.

1859
01:39:28,729 --> 01:39:31,163
With your teacher's salary,

1860
01:39:31,265 --> 01:39:35,167
it would be impossible to
provide for your family.

1861
01:39:36,403 --> 01:39:37,768
But l wont provide for
them with charity either.

1862
01:39:38,539 --> 01:39:41,167
l know what you get paid...
every class with fifty students...

1863
01:39:41,275 --> 01:39:44,176
so much hard work... always
writing on the blackboard...

1864
01:39:44,278 --> 01:39:46,178
l know what you get paid...

1865
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:47,645
Peanuts. l know.

1866
01:39:48,615 --> 01:39:53,245
We work hard too,
but we make sweets.

1867
01:39:54,288 --> 01:39:56,256
We sell them for 150 per kilo.

1868
01:39:56,824 --> 01:39:58,451
lts eaten and finished off.

1869
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:04,388
But teacher... you
make good human beings.

1870
01:40:05,299 --> 01:40:08,462
One small mistake, and the
result is a ''bad boy'' ...

1871
01:40:09,236 --> 01:40:10,931
...who will grow up to
destroy the country.

1872
01:40:11,572 --> 01:40:14,473
l'm giving this money for my
own good... my grandson's good.

1873
01:40:15,776 --> 01:40:17,209
lf you are broke, surely you will go

1874
01:40:17,311 --> 01:40:19,211
..around trying to
make money by other means.

1875
01:40:19,313 --> 01:40:20,746
Then how will you find
time to teach my grandson.

1876
01:40:20,914 --> 01:40:22,745
Go on take it, Mr. Duggal.

1877
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:25,218
Don't worry it is tuition fee.

1878
01:40:31,325 --> 01:40:35,819
That's the spirit. lf l
had a teacher like you...

1879
01:40:35,929 --> 01:40:37,692
then even l would
have become a good boy,

1880
01:40:38,265 --> 01:40:39,823
and l would have made my
moron sons good boys too.

1881
01:40:40,534 --> 01:40:43,560
Never mind. Now you make
my grandson a good boy.

1882
01:40:44,271 --> 01:40:47,570
Come on, Morons! What were
you going on about the tape?

1883
01:40:47,674 --> 01:40:48,766
Do we look like journalists?

1884
01:40:48,942 --> 01:40:50,967
We don't make bitter news,
we make syrupy sweets...

1885
01:40:51,278 --> 01:40:55,840
...They are so sweet you won't be
able to stop licking your fingers.

1886
01:40:56,950 --> 01:40:58,247
'Not till an outsider tells you...'

1887
01:40:58,352 --> 01:41:01,651
' do you appreciate
the value of someone

1888
01:41:01,755 --> 01:41:03,518
who is part of your everyday life.'

1889
01:41:03,757 --> 01:41:05,247
'Others may not have realised it...'

1890
01:41:05,359 --> 01:41:07,259
'...but Popley Uncle instantly...'

1891
01:41:07,361 --> 01:41:08,658
'...figured out a teacher's value.'

1892
01:41:09,296 --> 01:41:11,787
And because of him, l
realised my Papa's value.

1893
01:41:13,567 --> 01:41:15,660
Not like it turned out to be
a ''dramatic happy ending''.

1894
01:41:15,903 --> 01:41:17,268
'We didn't shift from
a one-bedroom flat...'

1895
01:41:17,371 --> 01:41:18,861
'...to a three-bedroom one.'

1896
01:41:19,306 --> 01:41:20,739
'Neither did Mummy
get a new fridge...'

1897
01:41:20,974 --> 01:41:22,407
'..nor did l get an iPod.'

1898
01:41:22,576 --> 01:41:24,544
'Nor did Deepu get his lPL team.'

1899
01:41:26,914 --> 01:41:29,678
'But after that episode,
l always proudly...'

1900
01:41:29,783 --> 01:41:31,410
'...tell everyone that
my father is a teacher.'

1901
01:41:34,588 --> 01:41:36,283
'No matter how many necklaces...'

1902
01:41:36,390 --> 01:41:39,689
'..Mickey's father sells to buy
new cars, no one introduces him...'

1903
01:41:39,793 --> 01:41:41,886
'...as, ''The man who
made me a good boy.'''

1904
01:41:42,463 --> 01:41:44,294
So what if we couldn't
buy the car of my choice,

1905
01:41:44,398 --> 01:41:45,422
we did get to buy a car.

1906
01:41:45,599 --> 01:41:47,567
Moreover Deepu got out of betting.

1907
01:41:47,935 --> 01:41:50,836
And all these good things
happened while buying a car.

1908
01:41:51,472 --> 01:41:53,770
'l wonder what will happen
when we buy a home theatre.'

1909
01:41:53,941 --> 01:41:55,841
Who says consumerism is bad.

1910
01:41:56,343 --> 01:41:58,311
'Whoever says that is an idiot.'

1911
01:41:58,412 --> 01:41:59,504
Yay!!!

1912
01:42:02,349 --> 01:42:03,373
Hey! Come out! l want to sit...

1913
01:42:03,484 --> 01:42:05,577
l'm going to sit in front and guide!

1914
01:42:05,686 --> 01:42:06,914
No. lf Papa will sit in the front,
then l won't drive.

1915
01:42:07,020 --> 01:42:08,851
Why am l always made
to sit at the back?!

1916
01:42:08,956 --> 01:42:11,322
l'm going, l'll catch a bus.
- Dude!

1917
01:42:11,425 --> 01:42:14,724
My dear, come here, no fear.
Come. Come here.

1918
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:21,992
Sir, should l make it a full-tank?

1919
01:42:22,102 --> 01:42:23,330
Rates are being hiked from tomorrow.

1920
01:42:23,437 --> 01:42:26,338
By how much?
- By 5.5% on petrol.

1921
01:42:27,641 --> 01:42:29,609
From tomorrow?
- Should l fill it up?

1922
01:42:29,776 --> 01:42:31,869
Rates are being hiked,
not my salary.

1923
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:33,003
Just fill 10 litres.

1924
01:42:34,781 --> 01:42:36,544
Now slowly release
the clutch. Slowly.

1925
01:42:38,118 --> 01:42:40,678
Slowly! lt's not an express.

1926
01:42:45,726 --> 01:42:46,750
Wow, Papa! You did it!

1927
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:47,952
Not bad at all!

1928
01:42:52,466 --> 01:42:53,490
Well done, Mr. Santosh Duggal!

1929
01:42:54,401 --> 01:42:55,766
What's the use of
going to the mall now?

1930
01:42:56,403 --> 01:42:58,030
The movie must have already started.

1931
01:42:58,672 --> 01:43:02,699
On our scooter we would
have squeezed our way through.

1932
01:43:02,876 --> 01:43:05,845
You have a car now.
Forget the scooter.

1933
01:43:10,951 --> 01:43:12,714
Now you look like a car owner!

1934
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:15,718
ls that your car, sir?
- Yes. lt's good, isn't it?

1935
01:43:15,822 --> 01:43:18,586
l wonder what state it'll
be in, when you get it back.

1936
01:43:18,692 --> 01:43:20,717
What?
- See for yourself.

1937
01:43:21,628 --> 01:43:23,391
Stop!
- Stop!

1938
01:43:23,497 --> 01:43:24,589
lt's new! lt'll get spoilt!
- Stop!

1939
01:43:25,566 --> 01:43:27,397
Please spare us!
- Stop!

1940
01:43:47,988 --> 01:43:49,012
Come out here.

1941
01:43:51,458 --> 01:43:52,550
We are about to win
the cricket match.

1942
01:43:52,659 --> 01:43:53,683
Duggal!

1943
01:43:53,794 --> 01:43:54,818
And it's a big hit ...
it's a six. lndia has won!

1944
01:43:54,928 --> 01:43:56,418
lndia has won! lndia is
the champion once again!

1945
01:44:01,602 --> 01:44:02,762
Thank you! Thank you!

1946
01:44:02,869 --> 01:44:09,433
lndia! lndia Oye!
lndia! lndia Oye!
