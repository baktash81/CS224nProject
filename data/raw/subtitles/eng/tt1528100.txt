1
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:16,295
It's true, the hittite army
has 16,000 troops camped outside Kadesh.

2
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:18,475
What's less clear is why.

3
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:21,604
The hittites are trying
to cross the border.

4
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,097
Obviously.

5
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,234
What else would they be doing?

6
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,570
Anticipating an invasion by us,
according to our information.

7
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,228
They think we are...

8
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,946
Preparing an attack,
which we are not.

9
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,487
What I don't want to do, and won't do,
is sit here...

10
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:40,163
And wait until we're fighting
hittite armies...

11
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,452
Outside the palace walls.

12
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,956
Come.

13
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,883
What do the entrails say?

14
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,303
They don't "say" anything.

15
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,974
They imply.

16
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,182
And that's open to interpretation.

17
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,722
So, interpret them.

18
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,385
We'll win or we won't
in a preemptive attack?

19
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,394
It's a yes or a no.

20
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,904
And it's not clear.

21
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,072
But something else is.

22
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:23,697
In the battle, a leader will be saved...

23
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,745
And his savior will someday lead.

24
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,586
Then the entrails should also say...

25
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,588
That we will abandon reason...

26
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,380
And be guided by omens.

27
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:46,177
Great sekhmet...

28
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,805
Pharaoh drinks in your name...

29
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:53,025
And prays for victory
over the hittites at Kadesh.

30
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:58,988
Your first order of business
when the time comes, you retire her.

31
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,491
I will.

32
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,452
I don't know why my father hasn't.

33
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,451
But, just in case...

34
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:09,825
If you see me in any real danger out there,
ride the other way.

35
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:12,171
I'm serious.

36
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,632
When I look at you,
I still see the two boys...

37
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,344
Who grew up together, close as brothers.

38
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,137
If, for any reason...

39
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,599
You ever forget that...

40
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,682
Let these remind you.

41
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,648
Long enough to be effective
from horseback...

42
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,517
Not so long that you trip over them.

43
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:35,817
This is his. You've got mine.

44
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,489
That's right. That's how I want it.

45
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:38,698
You have each other's...

46
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,816
To keep each other safe.

47
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,374
Promise me you'll do that...

48
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,533
Always.

49
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,675
SETI! SETI! SETI!

50
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,261
SETI!

51
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:14,005
There!

52
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:33,268
Deploy amun division to the north,
ra division to the center...

53
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,650
And ptah to the South.
And we hold Seth in reserve.

54
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,687
-In reserve?
-Yes.

55
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,696
We should concentrate our strength
in the center.

56
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,700
You should concentrate yours
on fighting.

57
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,701
Leave the generalship to me.

58
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:04,112
Fire!

59
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:15,752
Fire!

60
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,438
Charge!

61
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,092
Take ramses! Go!

62
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:20,853
Go!

63
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:33,113
Turn around! Turn around!

64
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:54,125
Moses! Moses! Moses!

65
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:08,349
Moses.

66
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,147
What happened out there?

67
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,440
Nothing.

68
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:17,283
I asked the commanders the same thing.
They, too, lied.

69
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:18,988
And I'm tired of it.

70
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:22,532
He thinks something happened.

71
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,326
-But it didn't.
-Meaning?

72
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:27,158
The high priestess, her prophecy.

73
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:29,326
She said she couldn't see who would win.

74
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:32,844
The other one.
"The leader will be saved..."

75
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:34,298
And so on.

76
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,009
You saved my son's life?

77
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:41,341
Yes.

78
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:43,854
Sit.

79
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:47,846
"Thank you" is not sufficient...

80
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:50,691
But thank you.

81
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:54,975
I know you don't believe
in omens or prophecies...

82
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:57,025
But I do believe.

83
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:58,899
And I respect that.

84
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,703
But this isn't anything.

85
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,200
This doesn't even make any sense.

86
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:05,873
Because you're not my blood.

87
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,327
Yes.

88
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,039
It's true, you can't succeed me.

89
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,626
Not in the usual way.

90
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,210
Not in any way.

91
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:18,385
In any way imaginable, sitting here.

92
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:23,716
It's horrible to say this
about one's own son...

93
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:28,221
But I trust you more than him to lead.

94
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,728
"The hittite chariotry...

95
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:36,442
"Crashed through our defense
and began its attack.

96
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,570
"I found myself
surrounded by the enemy...

97
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:43,034
"No soldier, no shield-bearer...

98
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:45,583
"Facing a desperate fight for my life.

99
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,736
"Only with the help of the gods...

100
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,373
"Did I defeat our attackers...

101
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:52,674
"And rejoin ra division."

102
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,248
Stop there.

103
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,804
Anything you'd like to rephrase?

104
00:13:59,131 --> 00:13:59,961
No.

105
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:04,052
-Shall I go on?
-No, I'm sure the rest is fine.

106
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:05,434
What's next?

107
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,720
Pithom.

108
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:07,893
What about it?

109
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,641
The situation. The slaves.

110
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:12,603
Fine. Ramses.

111
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:14,524
What?

112
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:17,443
Go up there, meet with the viceroy,
look around, make a report.

113
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:20,031
Me?

114
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:24,108
It will be yours someday.
Take an interest in it.

115
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,278
What else?

116
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:38,248
I'll go to see the viceroy.

117
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:39,595
No.

118
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:41,796
I'll go.

119
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,219
It's beneath you.

120
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,469
It's beneath any general.

121
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:47,800
I'll do it.

122
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:50,308
Ramses...

123
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:52,101
Can we forget what happened...

124
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:54,062
On the battlefield?

125
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,272
If our positions had been reversed...

126
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:58,153
I would've saved your life, too.

127
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,110
I know. I know.

128
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:14,333
It was a good shot.

129
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:17,675
Even if the gods did guide your aim.

130
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:25,183
A little venom in your blood
is a good thing.

131
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:30,098
Makes you less vulnerable
to the next poisonous bite.

132
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,138
Maybe even my father's.

133
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:15,557
Welcome to pithom.

134
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:19,396
You get used to the smell.

135
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:38,583
The viceroy seems to be enjoying
a good share of his resources.

136
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:42,344
This isn't a job everyone wants to do,
my lord.

137
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:47,547
A certain degree of comfort is necessary
to keep up his spirits.

138
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:54,465
You know what the problem is?
People live too long these days.

139
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:57,604
Every year, the death rate
lags further behind the birth rate.

140
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,940
And these people...

141
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:03,858
They reproduce like it's a sport.

142
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:06,359
This is the problem?
A growing work force?

143
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:09,031
No, of course not.
It's good for production.

144
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:11,571
Of course it is, but only to a point.

145
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:15,116
When that population wants you dead...

146
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,080
Yes, it's a problem.

147
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:21,789
So, either I'm given more troops
to maintain order...

148
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:23,464
Or I start thinning out the herd.

149
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:25,632
You start slaughtering people...

150
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:29,591
For no reason other than
this precarious theory...

151
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:32,643
You will provoke the very thing
you say you wish to avoid.

152
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:35,468
Fine, then give me the troops.

153
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,770
Let's go down and talk to them.

154
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:39,979
Why on earth?

155
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:44,478
You're worried about sedition.
Let's find out if that worry is real.

156
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:45,773
By talking to them?

157
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:49,115
By looking at them...

158
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,572
When I talk with them.

159
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:53,282
You can tell a lot about somebody...

160
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:54,993
Looking him in the eye.

161
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,660
Let me tell you something...

162
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:00,331
About hebrews.

163
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:03,169
They are a conniving, combative people.

164
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:06,465
Do you know what "israelite" means...

165
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:07,713
In their own language?

166
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,134
"He who fights with God."

167
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:12,634
"He who wrestles with God."

168
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:14,296
There is a difference.

169
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:18,522
I may not be as educated as you,
which, apparently, you want to remind me of.

170
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,642
But I have to deal with them every day.

171
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:23,225
I know what I'm talking about.

172
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,650
You don't have to come.
I'll go down there myself.

173
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:05,976
Stop!

174
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,150
Why is he being punished?

175
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,230
Persistent troublemaker, my lord.

176
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:13,699
Why is he smiling?

177
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:16,244
He says he feels no pain, my lord.

178
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:18,874
Then why whip him?

179
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:33,801
You were not gathered up at random.

180
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:35,841
I asked to see...

181
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:37,593
The elders.

182
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:42,057
Come on. What do you pray for?

183
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:44,393
We pray to see canaan again.

184
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:45,564
Canaan again?

185
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:46,812
You've never seen it.

186
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:48,814
I've seen canaan.

187
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:51,566
I've seen that it's inhabited
by tribes fiercer than Egypt's military.

188
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,228
So, you won't be returning to it...

189
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:54,647
Or, if you do, from it.

190
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:56,575
-God says otherwise.
-Which God?

191
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:57,913
Your God? The God of Abraham?

192
00:19:57,948 --> 00:19:59,738
The God that says that you are special?

193
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:00,913
That you are chosen?

194
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:02,291
Come here. Up.

195
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:03,447
Come here.

196
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:10,591
He's wrong.

197
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:15,512
I can see you're unconvinced,
and that's a problem.

198
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:18,836
Because next to unrealistic belief
lies fanaticism...

199
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:21,216
And next to that, sedition,
and next to that, revolution.

200
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:22,973
And it all starts with the elders.

201
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:24,025
What's your name?

202
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,097
What's yours?

203
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:29,732
I'll tell you.

204
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:31,361
I am Moses, son of bithia...

205
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,148
Grandson of horemheb.

206
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,411
Record this one's name
and the rest of them.

207
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:42,369
Bring in the next group.

208
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,541
My name is nun.

209
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:52,003
My lord!

210
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:53,504
-Stop there!
-Let him through.

211
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:56,842
There's something the elder
has to tell you.

212
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:58,512
But not here.

213
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,630
Say where and when.

214
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:01,258
The prayer house, tonight.

215
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:03,849
Here.

216
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,284
I see you've survived your adventure.

217
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:17,034
Sorry to make you wait again.

218
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:18,779
I'm not waiting.

219
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:21,661
-How was your trip to the quarry?
-Fine.

220
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:22,738
You saw what I'm up against.

221
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:26,162
Tell me...

222
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:29,163
Is there any more of my records
I could get for you before you leave?

223
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:30,496
You can tell me...

224
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:35,631
Has all of this
been reported to Memphis?

225
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:38,091
Was it approved?
Do you have it in writing?

226
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:40,427
Of course. It's on record.

227
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:41,927
So you don't mind if we check?

228
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:45,641
Of course I don't mind.

229
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,930
But I don't understand
what's gone wrong.

230
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:50,025
Have I done something to displease you?

231
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,270
And if so, is there any way
I could please you?

232
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:56,816
You can stop living like a king.

233
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:59,072
You're not one.

234
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,790
"...and you will occupy
the land of canaan."

235
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,424
Canaan is already occupied.

236
00:22:58,003 --> 00:22:59,673
God promises we will return.

237
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:01,973
In chains or in coffins?

238
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:03,427
As free men...

239
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:06,007
Into a land flowing with milk and honey.

240
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:17,775
Can they at least wait outside?
We're not dangerous.

241
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:19,324
Wait by the horses.

242
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:25,281
Do you believe in coincidence?

243
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:27,279
As much as anything else.

244
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:29,204
I don't think this is one.

245
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:30,455
What isn't?

246
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:33,249
You coming to pithom.

247
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:34,458
Why did you come?

248
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:35,618
Business.

249
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:40,843
Sit.

250
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:49,887
Who's your father?

251
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:53,144
I know you don't know his name...

252
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:55,143
Only that he was a general
in pharaoh's army...

253
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:57,435
Unnamed by your mother.

254
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,729
I can see
this is making you uncomfortable.

255
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:03,284
This will interest you.

256
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:05,954
There was no general.

257
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:08,529
Your mother...

258
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:10,744
The woman you call your mother,
has no children.

259
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:13,204
You were born a slave.

260
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:15,125
Don't go. Don't go.

261
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:16,923
It's better for you that I do.

262
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:19,168
I'm leaving.

263
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:24,132
If you leave now,
you'll just come back...

264
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:26,836
Because you know something's wrong.
You've always felt it.

265
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:31,053
Please.

266
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:33,392
Everybody out.

267
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:35,351
Out.

268
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:48,203
The year of your birth...

269
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:51,698
There was a prophecy
that our leader would be born...

270
00:24:51,742 --> 00:24:54,702
To liberate us from our bondage.

271
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:57,375
And so, there was an edict
from Memphis...

272
00:24:57,414 --> 00:25:00,834
To kill every firstborn Hebrew boy.

273
00:25:01,585 --> 00:25:03,755
Your parents didn't wait
for that to happen.

274
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:08,677
Any chance of your survival
was better than no chance.

275
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:11,337
They handed you to your sister.

276
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:16,386
She took you in a basket
to the banks of the river...

277
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:19,563
And she floated you to where she knew...

278
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:22,903
Pharaoh paramesse's daughter,
bithia, bathed.

279
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,740
Bithia took you and your sister,
Miriam, as a maid...

280
00:25:26,777 --> 00:25:28,817
And raised you as her own.

281
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:31,912
She probably even loved you...

282
00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:35,619
But she never told you, or anyone else,
the truth.

283
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,949
You are Hebrew.

284
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:40,119
The truth?

285
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:45,416
The truth is,
it's not even that good a story.

286
00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:48,877
And I thought you people
were meant to be...

287
00:25:48,924 --> 00:25:51,054
Good storytellers.

288
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:05,153
You, slave.

289
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,650
You!

290
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:00,079
Do you expect a reward
for this information?

291
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:04,042
Our reward is being of service to you.

292
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:06,132
That said, if there were...

293
00:27:06,168 --> 00:27:09,418
Some token you had in mind
beyond that...

294
00:27:09,755 --> 00:27:11,345
We wouldn't refuse it.

295
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,180
How about this, then?

296
00:27:14,218 --> 00:27:16,258
What about if I don't kill you?

297
00:27:17,054 --> 00:27:20,224
That would be sufficient payment.

298
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:23,101
You people.

299
00:28:06,645 --> 00:28:09,445
Please leave.

300
00:28:10,774 --> 00:28:12,154
Please.

301
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:19,323
How did it go?

302
00:28:20,242 --> 00:28:21,912
We can talk about that another time.

303
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:23,452
We can talk about it now...

304
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:26,575
If only as a respite from this army
of grim-faced physicians.

305
00:28:30,002 --> 00:28:31,462
Sit.

306
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:41,144
We're taking a thorough look
at the city records...

307
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,890
And the man is clearly a thief.

308
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:46,601
It's one of life's
more depressing ironies...

309
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:48,443
That the men who crave power...

310
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:51,818
Are best fitted to acquire it,
and least fitted to exercise it.

311
00:28:57,321 --> 00:28:58,661
What's wrong, Moses?

312
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:00,821
You're sick.

313
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,660
Something else is troubling you.

314
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:05,501
I can tell.

315
00:29:06,455 --> 00:29:08,835
No, nothing else.

316
00:29:29,645 --> 00:29:31,865
May you be alert...

317
00:29:32,189 --> 00:29:34,359
Rejuvenated and protected by the gods...

318
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:37,689
Every moment of your eternal life.

319
00:30:30,706 --> 00:30:33,536
And to the left.

320
00:30:35,043 --> 00:30:36,713
No, your left.

321
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:38,253
More, more, more.

322
00:30:38,297 --> 00:30:39,587
Good.

323
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:42,594
It is tall.

324
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:43,974
Monuments are monuments...

325
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:46,391
For a reason. They inspire.

326
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,890
Inspire what, in this case?

327
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:53,395
In this, and in every case, power.

328
00:30:55,606 --> 00:30:57,766
Say it out loud, whatever it is.

329
00:30:58,275 --> 00:31:01,405
The viceroy of pithom is outside.

330
00:31:01,445 --> 00:31:02,745
He's not on the agenda.

331
00:31:02,988 --> 00:31:05,408
He can go back to pithom until he is.

332
00:31:05,449 --> 00:31:07,079
No, we should deal with this.

333
00:31:07,117 --> 00:31:08,487
Bring him in.

334
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:22,588
If you came here to beg
the new king's forgiveness...

335
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:23,473
It won't work.

336
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:25,139
Arrest him.

337
00:31:25,177 --> 00:31:26,297
Wait, please.

338
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:28,968
May I at least respond?

339
00:31:29,014 --> 00:31:30,314
I beg you.

340
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:31,979
It's in your interest.

341
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:35,016
-You make it short.
-I will...

342
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:37,309
To the king alone.

343
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,270
My advice is that...

344
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:41,986
He, and the other generals,
also leave the room.

345
00:31:43,946 --> 00:31:45,446
Really?

346
00:31:45,489 --> 00:31:47,319
That's your advice?

347
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:50,619
You are not his advisor.

348
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:54,157
That's right. You are.

349
00:31:54,206 --> 00:31:55,286
That's right.

350
00:31:55,332 --> 00:31:56,882
Moses.

351
00:32:00,295 --> 00:32:01,125
Moses.

352
00:32:04,508 --> 00:32:06,008
Everybody but the viceroy...

353
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:08,547
Out.

354
00:32:26,697 --> 00:32:28,367
Terrible news.

355
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,870
There you are.

356
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:35,619
So...

357
00:32:36,665 --> 00:32:37,835
The viceroy.

358
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:39,708
You didn't arrest him.

359
00:32:40,878 --> 00:32:43,338
You didn't take
your chief advisor's advice.

360
00:32:45,716 --> 00:32:47,716
No, he came.

361
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,930
He told me of an incident
involving two guards...

362
00:32:51,972 --> 00:32:54,182
One of which survived the attack.

363
00:32:54,224 --> 00:32:57,194
And I told him I did not care.

364
00:32:58,228 --> 00:33:01,018
And then, he told me the most
unbelievable story.

365
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:03,978
Told to him, he said,
by very reliable sources.

366
00:33:04,026 --> 00:33:05,566
Then, when pressed...

367
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:10,030
He admitted that they were Hebrew spies.

368
00:33:10,407 --> 00:33:11,867
You know what I'm talking about.

369
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:13,239
Yes.

370
00:33:14,745 --> 00:33:16,545
And what do you make of it?

371
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:20,287
I think it's offensive,
and I think it's ridiculous.

372
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:21,714
Yes. Yes!

373
00:33:21,752 --> 00:33:23,502
You, of all people, a Hebrew.

374
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,670
And I said...

375
00:33:27,716 --> 00:33:30,586
How can I believe such a story?

376
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:33,099
Cousin...

377
00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:35,718
You can't.

378
00:33:35,766 --> 00:33:38,346
What if I take the chance
of not believing it, Moses?

379
00:33:40,604 --> 00:33:42,774
What am I to do?

380
00:33:44,233 --> 00:33:44,943
Bithia!

381
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,859
Mother.

382
00:33:50,906 --> 00:33:51,946
The man is a thief.

383
00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:53,372
My son discovers this.

384
00:33:54,117 --> 00:33:55,037
Not you.

385
00:33:55,077 --> 00:33:58,537
And he reports it to your father,
who would have hanged this thief...

386
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,580
If he hadn't been dying himself.

387
00:34:00,624 --> 00:34:02,294
You believe his feeble,
self-serving lies.

388
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:05,089
All I want to know is if it is true.

389
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:06,548
I didn't ask for a tirade.

390
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:09,381
To talk about this any longer...

391
00:34:09,424 --> 00:34:10,764
Would dignify it...

392
00:34:10,801 --> 00:34:13,051
-And I won't do that.
-Answer the question.

393
00:34:13,095 --> 00:34:14,855
Yes or no?

394
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:16,098
Was I talking to you?

395
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,429
Bring her in. Bring her in.

396
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,310
Now!

397
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:23,269
Miriam!

398
00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:26,067
Come. Sit down.

399
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:30,738
Now, I'm going to ask you some things...

400
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:33,699
That are going to seem
very strange to you.

401
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,620
I just would like you
to answer them truthfully.

402
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,660
How do you know Moses?

403
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:42,079
You know how I know him...

404
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,584
And you.

405
00:34:45,502 --> 00:34:47,712
I helped raise you both.

406
00:34:48,797 --> 00:34:50,627
So you are not his sister, then?

407
00:34:51,258 --> 00:34:52,758
Of course not.

408
00:34:54,052 --> 00:34:55,852
And you're not a Hebrew.

409
00:34:55,888 --> 00:34:57,218
No.

410
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:02,597
Place your arm on the table.

411
00:35:05,981 --> 00:35:07,111
Ramses--

412
00:35:07,149 --> 00:35:07,939
don't be stupid!

413
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:10,649
I am not talking to you!

414
00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:14,412
I am talking to her.

415
00:35:17,576 --> 00:35:19,786
Your whole arm on the table, Miriam.

416
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,410
Thank you.

417
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:24,917
Ramses...

418
00:35:25,918 --> 00:35:27,208
Don't take this any further.

419
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:30,303
Don't take this any further, or what?

420
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:32,546
Do not take this any further.

421
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:34,971
Are you quite sure about that?

422
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,680
Get your hand off it, or use it, now.

423
00:35:39,598 --> 00:35:42,558
Or perhaps you'd like to answer
the question?

424
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:50,397
Then I'll proceed.

425
00:35:51,443 --> 00:35:53,573
Miriam, I'm going to ask you again...

426
00:35:53,612 --> 00:35:54,822
And if your answer is again no...

427
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,950
I apologize for what happens next.

428
00:36:02,162 --> 00:36:04,412
Are you his sister?

429
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:07,708
No.

430
00:36:17,803 --> 00:36:19,183
Yes!

431
00:36:20,472 --> 00:36:22,352
Yes!

432
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:57,765
You don't need a reason to kill him,
but you have one.

433
00:36:57,801 --> 00:36:59,591
-This was treason.
-How was it treason?

434
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:00,886
He just admitted he knew.

435
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:03,309
That wasn't an admission!

436
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:05,977
Simply did not want her arm lopped off!

437
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:09,848
I saw it in his eyes.

438
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:12,944
He does not believe this story.

439
00:37:12,983 --> 00:37:15,783
I don't want to believe it!

440
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:18,819
You want to believe it, because it's an
opportunity to be rid of him...

441
00:37:18,864 --> 00:37:19,994
Which you always wanted.

442
00:37:20,032 --> 00:37:23,282
I didn't say "exiled," I said "dead."

443
00:37:26,163 --> 00:37:28,003
That, I'm sure, will follow...

444
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,460
Where he's going.

445
00:37:38,008 --> 00:37:39,468
Khyan...

446
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,300
Allow me to talk to my mother.

447
00:37:42,346 --> 00:37:44,386
Yes, sir, yes.

448
00:38:01,365 --> 00:38:02,915
Come, Miriam.

449
00:38:05,536 --> 00:38:10,616
It isn't every man who would protect a
servant who's nothing more to him than that.

450
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:13,626
Certainly no one else in this family...

451
00:38:13,669 --> 00:38:15,339
Including me.

452
00:38:15,379 --> 00:38:19,049
I wouldn't have said
what he wanted to hear.

453
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,430
And neither would she.

454
00:38:26,098 --> 00:38:28,388
That's how much we love you.

455
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:35,611
"We"?

456
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:41,279
It's not true.

457
00:38:41,572 --> 00:38:43,532
It is true.

458
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:46,527
You were wearing this
when I brought you to the river.

459
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:51,115
I took it off you for obvious reasons.

460
00:38:51,582 --> 00:38:53,002
That's you.

461
00:38:54,418 --> 00:38:58,048
The connection between you
and our mother.

462
00:39:02,593 --> 00:39:04,763
Your sister saved your life.

463
00:39:05,846 --> 00:39:07,926
Now you saved hers...

464
00:39:08,932 --> 00:39:09,932
Moshe.

465
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:36,455
Miriam.

466
00:39:53,477 --> 00:39:55,057
Sorry, sir.

467
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:02,281
Moses!

468
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:04,489
Moses!

469
00:42:49,361 --> 00:42:51,151
I have nothing to steal.

470
00:42:51,196 --> 00:42:53,066
My horse is dead.

471
00:42:53,115 --> 00:42:55,705
We're not here for your horse, moshe.

472
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:02,621
A little bit higher.

473
00:45:20,762 --> 00:45:21,682
What are you doing?

474
00:45:22,014 --> 00:45:23,854
Don't stop. Keep working.

475
00:45:23,891 --> 00:45:25,641
You, get water for our goats.

476
00:45:37,863 --> 00:45:38,783
You.

477
00:45:39,364 --> 00:45:41,204
Wait your turn.

478
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:54,092
Move your animals away from the troughs.

479
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:09,099
It's yours again.

480
00:46:32,334 --> 00:46:34,044
Where are you from?

481
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:36,551
West of here.

482
00:46:37,631 --> 00:46:39,051
Where are you going?

483
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:40,927
East.

484
00:46:41,593 --> 00:46:43,303
What did you do?

485
00:46:43,971 --> 00:46:45,221
What do you mean?

486
00:46:48,308 --> 00:46:50,018
You committed some crime?

487
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,140
With respect...

488
00:46:51,186 --> 00:46:55,016
Your daughters invited me for some food.

489
00:46:55,065 --> 00:46:58,525
They did not tell me
there would be an interrogation.

490
00:46:58,569 --> 00:47:00,109
I'm sorry.

491
00:47:00,153 --> 00:47:01,573
I'm just curious.

492
00:47:05,409 --> 00:47:07,869
You are welcome to get cleaned up
before dinner...

493
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:09,041
If that appeals to you...

494
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:10,209
And stay the night if you want...

495
00:47:11,582 --> 00:47:13,792
Before continuing on...

496
00:47:13,834 --> 00:47:15,794
To wherever it is.

497
00:47:15,836 --> 00:47:17,086
Thank you.

498
00:47:42,029 --> 00:47:43,409
Describe Memphis to someone...

499
00:47:43,447 --> 00:47:45,447
Who's never been there and never will.

500
00:47:47,117 --> 00:47:48,237
It's...

501
00:47:48,744 --> 00:47:50,544
I don't want to say "civilized"...

502
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:53,869
Because I don't want to offend,
but it is civilized.

503
00:47:53,916 --> 00:47:57,786
There's more there than sheep and goats.

504
00:47:59,046 --> 00:48:00,416
There's more here than that.

505
00:48:00,464 --> 00:48:02,134
Really? Where?

506
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:06,761
I'm sorry, that was rude.

507
00:48:06,803 --> 00:48:08,513
That was rude.

508
00:48:08,555 --> 00:48:10,925
I'm not ignorant
just because I live here.

509
00:48:10,974 --> 00:48:12,774
I can see that.

510
00:48:18,315 --> 00:48:19,695
I can tell you one thing.

511
00:48:19,733 --> 00:48:20,823
This is by far...

512
00:48:21,276 --> 00:48:23,446
The nicest place...

513
00:48:23,487 --> 00:48:25,907
Between here and there.

514
00:48:27,241 --> 00:48:29,081
And so you're leaving?

515
00:48:29,117 --> 00:48:30,447
Of course.

516
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:32,999
There's nothing here
for someone like me.

517
00:48:37,626 --> 00:48:38,586
When?

518
00:48:39,461 --> 00:48:41,461
Today?

519
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:34,386
Remember this moment in time...

520
00:49:36,393 --> 00:49:38,313
For after these vows...

521
00:49:38,812 --> 00:49:40,612
You shall say to the world...

522
00:49:42,232 --> 00:49:45,652
"This is my husband." "This is my wife."

523
00:49:51,158 --> 00:49:52,408
I, zipporah...

524
00:49:52,451 --> 00:49:53,661
I, Moses...

525
00:49:53,702 --> 00:49:55,202
-Accept you, zipporah...
-Accept you, Moses...

526
00:49:55,913 --> 00:49:58,293
To be no other than yourself.

527
00:49:59,041 --> 00:50:01,331
Loving what I know of you...

528
00:50:01,376 --> 00:50:04,336
Trusting what I do not yet know.

529
00:50:05,881 --> 00:50:07,301
With respect...

530
00:50:07,674 --> 00:50:09,684
For your integrity...

531
00:50:09,718 --> 00:50:11,218
And faith...

532
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:14,011
In your abiding love for me.

533
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:17,558
In all that life may bring us...

534
00:50:17,601 --> 00:50:18,811
I pledge my love.

535
00:50:18,852 --> 00:50:20,312
I pledge my love.

536
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:22,194
Who makes you happy?

537
00:50:23,774 --> 00:50:25,284
You do.

538
00:50:30,948 --> 00:50:33,368
What's the most important thing
in your life?

539
00:50:34,451 --> 00:50:35,871
You are.

540
00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:40,419
Where would you rather be?

541
00:50:40,749 --> 00:50:41,749
Nowhere.

542
00:50:43,836 --> 00:50:45,456
And when will you leave me?

543
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:47,960
Never.

544
00:50:49,508 --> 00:50:51,468
Proceed.

545
00:51:48,483 --> 00:51:50,113
I said "per se."

546
00:51:51,069 --> 00:51:54,199
I don't want to discuss my tomb, per se.

547
00:51:54,907 --> 00:51:59,117
I want to discuss why you seem to want
to discuss it all the time.

548
00:51:59,161 --> 00:52:00,251
Respectfully...

549
00:52:00,287 --> 00:52:02,707
It should have been your first
construction order on taking the throne.

550
00:52:03,248 --> 00:52:05,748
It'll be a big project,
as you might imagine.

551
00:52:05,792 --> 00:52:08,092
So is my house, apparently.

552
00:52:09,046 --> 00:52:10,876
Is there a problem with the palace?

553
00:52:10,923 --> 00:52:12,513
It's not done.

554
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:14,379
It won't be long now.

555
00:52:14,426 --> 00:52:17,346
You said that months ago.
Meanwhile I'm living there like...

556
00:52:17,387 --> 00:52:19,097
A bedouin.

557
00:52:20,557 --> 00:52:21,637
Get it done.

558
00:52:22,351 --> 00:52:23,811
Faster!

559
00:52:24,728 --> 00:52:26,728
Or do I have to kill somebody?

560
00:52:27,898 --> 00:52:29,648
I think you made your point.

561
00:52:40,369 --> 00:52:42,369
Good throw, father.

562
00:52:42,412 --> 00:52:44,082
Just aim a little higher.

563
00:52:48,085 --> 00:52:48,845
Almost.

564
00:52:57,803 --> 00:52:59,183
Have you ever been to the top?

565
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:03,020
No.

566
00:53:04,393 --> 00:53:06,353
Would you like to?

567
00:53:06,395 --> 00:53:08,065
Mother says it's forbidden.

568
00:53:08,105 --> 00:53:09,115
By who?

569
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:11,150
Our God.

570
00:53:12,651 --> 00:53:14,111
Our God...

571
00:53:14,611 --> 00:53:17,491
Stops us from climbing mountains?

572
00:53:17,531 --> 00:53:19,201
Not every Mountain.

573
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:20,990
Just that one.

574
00:53:22,953 --> 00:53:24,333
It's God's Mountain.

575
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,010
You're confusing him.

576
00:53:46,393 --> 00:53:47,813
I'm not trying to.

577
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:51,692
Is it good for our boy to grow up
believing in nothing?

578
00:53:51,732 --> 00:53:55,742
Is it bad to grow up
believing in yourself?

579
00:53:56,987 --> 00:53:59,157
-It's my faith.
-I know.

580
00:53:59,198 --> 00:54:00,948
-And it's his, too.
-I understand.

581
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:02,951
He can make up his mind when he's older.

582
00:54:02,993 --> 00:54:04,543
-Yes.
-Just like you.

583
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:08,370
He's a lot like me already.

584
00:55:31,206 --> 00:55:32,246
Moshe.

585
00:55:52,603 --> 00:55:54,103
Help me!

586
00:55:54,938 --> 00:55:56,768
I think my leg is broken.

587
00:55:58,567 --> 00:56:00,397
More than that.

588
00:56:03,614 --> 00:56:05,244
What did you say?

589
00:56:08,285 --> 00:56:09,455
Who are you?

590
00:56:14,917 --> 00:56:15,917
Who are you?

591
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:18,960
I'm a Shepherd.

592
00:56:19,922 --> 00:56:22,092
I thought you were a general.

593
00:56:27,179 --> 00:56:28,599
I need a general.

594
00:56:33,143 --> 00:56:34,443
Why?

595
00:56:34,478 --> 00:56:36,148
To fight.

596
00:56:36,688 --> 00:56:37,688
Why else?

597
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:41,820
Fight who?

598
00:56:42,694 --> 00:56:44,034
For what?

599
00:56:46,031 --> 00:56:48,491
I think you know.

600
00:56:54,831 --> 00:56:58,341
I think you should go and see
what's happening to your people now.

601
00:56:59,127 --> 00:57:01,127
He won't be at peace until you do.

602
00:57:02,422 --> 00:57:04,842
Or are they not people...

603
00:57:05,342 --> 00:57:06,632
In your opinion?

604
00:57:10,514 --> 00:57:11,514
Who are you?

605
00:57:17,521 --> 00:57:19,361
I am.

606
00:57:30,284 --> 00:57:31,334
I am.

607
00:57:44,506 --> 00:57:46,336
You were hit on the head.

608
00:57:48,051 --> 00:57:49,391
Anything you saw...

609
00:57:49,845 --> 00:57:51,895
Or think you saw afterwards...

610
00:57:52,306 --> 00:57:53,426
Was an effect of that.

611
00:57:53,473 --> 00:57:55,023
The storm...

612
00:57:55,058 --> 00:57:58,478
The storm started before
I was hit on the head.

613
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,770
-It was not a storm.
-Fine, fine.

614
00:58:00,814 --> 00:58:02,654
The storm was something.

615
00:58:02,691 --> 00:58:04,691
It was something else.

616
00:58:04,735 --> 00:58:07,535
-But the boy was all in your head.
-How do you know?

617
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:08,661
How do you know?

618
00:58:08,697 --> 00:58:09,697
Because God isn't a boy!

619
00:58:10,657 --> 00:58:12,447
Then what does he look like?

620
00:58:12,492 --> 00:58:15,202
Describe him.
Describe him to someone like me.

621
00:58:15,245 --> 00:58:16,405
Do you know what you sound like?

622
00:58:16,914 --> 00:58:21,334
Yes. I sound delusional.

623
00:58:21,376 --> 00:58:22,246
Yes.

624
00:58:22,628 --> 00:58:24,338
Yes.

625
00:58:24,379 --> 00:58:27,629
-You just need more rest.
-Yes, yes.

626
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,930
I have to tell you something.

627
00:58:32,471 --> 00:58:34,721
I have to tell you something.

628
00:58:37,017 --> 00:58:40,057
I've not been completely honest
with you.

629
00:58:40,395 --> 00:58:42,265
About what?

630
00:58:42,564 --> 00:58:43,944
About who I am.

631
00:58:45,275 --> 00:58:48,735
About what I've done
and who I was.

632
00:58:49,655 --> 00:58:51,365
And how I feel.

633
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,240
-About what you feel about me?
-No.

634
00:58:55,744 --> 00:58:58,504
No, I've been honest about that.

635
00:59:01,834 --> 00:59:03,794
Rest.

636
00:59:04,753 --> 00:59:06,593
-Rest.
-Don't leave me.

637
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:08,010
No. No.

638
00:59:25,774 --> 00:59:27,654
Moshe.

639
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:45,040
Gershom?

640
00:59:51,592 --> 00:59:53,012
What are you doing out here?

641
00:59:53,051 --> 00:59:54,051
Nothing.

642
00:59:54,094 --> 00:59:55,604
I can't sleep.

643
00:59:58,557 --> 01:00:00,177
Are you worried about me?

644
01:00:01,727 --> 01:00:02,727
Yes.

645
01:00:04,062 --> 01:00:05,362
Don't.

646
01:00:07,024 --> 01:00:08,444
I'll be fine.

647
01:00:13,155 --> 01:00:14,245
What's that?

648
01:00:14,615 --> 01:00:15,825
What's it look like?

649
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:22,909
Come inside.

650
01:00:23,373 --> 01:00:25,003
Come inside!

651
01:00:50,442 --> 01:00:52,742
What are you going to do with all that?

652
01:00:55,656 --> 01:00:57,866
Make sure I see you again.

653
01:00:58,951 --> 01:01:02,411
Put it down and you can see me forever.

654
01:01:19,805 --> 01:01:21,105
What's this mean?

655
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:28,230
It's someone I used to know.

656
01:01:36,822 --> 01:01:38,782
This is not forever.

657
01:01:40,325 --> 01:01:43,035
I will see you again.

658
01:01:43,871 --> 01:01:45,791
Do you believe me?

659
01:01:50,961 --> 01:01:52,131
Good for you.

660
01:01:52,671 --> 01:01:56,171
Don't ever just say
what people want to hear.

661
01:01:58,177 --> 01:01:59,547
But I will...

662
01:01:59,928 --> 01:02:01,468
I will see you again.

663
01:02:08,937 --> 01:02:11,107
Will you keep this for me?

664
01:02:12,691 --> 01:02:14,231
Gershom.

665
01:02:15,194 --> 01:02:18,204
Gershom, please look at me.

666
01:02:33,003 --> 01:02:34,553
What kind of God tells a man...

667
01:02:34,588 --> 01:02:36,628
To leave his family?

668
01:02:37,341 --> 01:02:40,761
If you understand it,
I'll understand it.

669
01:02:41,637 --> 01:02:42,887
I don't.

670
01:02:44,014 --> 01:02:45,724
So I can't answer that question.

671
01:02:47,184 --> 01:02:50,354
If that's what faith means,
I will trade mine...

672
01:02:50,395 --> 01:02:51,895
To keep you.

673
01:02:59,655 --> 01:03:01,705
Don't touch me.

674
01:03:03,283 --> 01:03:04,493
Go.

675
01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:06,950
Go!

676
01:04:12,728 --> 01:04:15,518
Father, have you some milk to spare?

677
01:04:15,898 --> 01:04:17,108
Yes.

678
01:04:17,649 --> 01:04:19,109
Where did you come from?

679
01:04:21,195 --> 01:04:22,865
I come from the sea.

680
01:04:23,572 --> 01:04:26,662
It's a narrow and dangerous path.

681
01:04:33,665 --> 01:04:35,205
Thank you, father.

682
01:05:46,071 --> 01:05:49,621
Joshua. I remember you.

683
01:05:50,325 --> 01:05:52,655
Do you still feel no pain?

684
01:05:59,042 --> 01:06:00,672
Keep your eye on the horse.

685
01:06:14,892 --> 01:06:16,942
-Thank you.
-Welcome back, brother.

686
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:21,730
Aaron...

687
01:06:21,773 --> 01:06:23,153
Your brother.

688
01:06:23,734 --> 01:06:25,194
Ithamar.

689
01:06:28,071 --> 01:06:29,531
Ithamar, this...

690
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:32,120
Is your famous Uncle Moses.

691
01:06:32,993 --> 01:06:35,083
He was once a prince of Egypt.

692
01:07:07,569 --> 01:07:08,779
I'm fine.

693
01:07:10,906 --> 01:07:13,736
Everybody's fine.

694
01:07:51,989 --> 01:07:53,949
You sleep so well, my boy...

695
01:07:55,325 --> 01:07:58,325
Because you know you are loved.

696
01:08:00,998 --> 01:08:03,328
I've never slept so well.

697
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,110
I'm told I should address you...

698
01:08:25,147 --> 01:08:29,477
As ramses the great, now.

699
01:08:32,321 --> 01:08:33,361
Moses...

700
01:08:33,864 --> 01:08:35,824
You're alive.

701
01:08:35,866 --> 01:08:37,906
-I'm glad you're alive.
-Really?

702
01:08:38,493 --> 01:08:41,043
Is that why you only sent
two assassins to kill me?

703
01:08:41,997 --> 01:08:42,957
My mother.

704
01:08:42,998 --> 01:08:45,458
-Don't blame her.
-Yes, she wanted you dead.

705
01:08:45,501 --> 01:08:49,051
Who do you think hid your sword
where you would find it?

706
01:08:51,048 --> 01:08:52,918
Moses.

707
01:08:56,678 --> 01:08:58,428
I'm not here...

708
01:08:59,056 --> 01:09:01,636
To take your throne.

709
01:09:01,683 --> 01:09:03,353
It's not about the prophecy
that worries you so much.

710
01:09:03,393 --> 01:09:05,523
This is something else.

711
01:09:06,563 --> 01:09:07,903
I have been told...

712
01:09:09,233 --> 01:09:12,363
That things here have become...

713
01:09:13,612 --> 01:09:14,612
Much worse.

714
01:09:15,072 --> 01:09:18,242
Things are better than
they ever have been, Moses.

715
01:09:19,368 --> 01:09:20,368
No.

716
01:09:20,410 --> 01:09:22,910
-We have order.
-Order?

717
01:09:23,914 --> 01:09:25,124
The slaves...

718
01:09:25,874 --> 01:09:29,174
Their bodies burn night and day now.

719
01:09:29,211 --> 01:09:31,051
I've seen it with my own eyes.

720
01:09:31,088 --> 01:09:33,208
You call that order?

721
01:09:33,257 --> 01:09:34,377
They're slaves.

722
01:09:34,424 --> 01:09:35,844
-No, they're not.
-What would you expect?

723
01:09:35,884 --> 01:09:37,644
They're Egyptians,
they should be treated as Egyptians.

724
01:09:37,678 --> 01:09:39,218
They should have the same rights...

725
01:09:39,263 --> 01:09:40,893
They should be paid for their work...

726
01:09:40,931 --> 01:09:42,851
Or you must set them free.

727
01:09:43,892 --> 01:09:45,352
They are not Egyptians.

728
01:09:45,769 --> 01:09:48,519
They are slaves, Moses.
What else do you expect?

729
01:09:48,564 --> 01:09:49,734
They wouldn't know what to do...

730
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:53,400
If all of a sudden they were left
to fend for themselves like animals.

731
01:09:53,443 --> 01:09:55,783
Do not call them animals!

732
01:09:58,282 --> 01:10:01,412
Listen,
from an economic standpoint alone...

733
01:10:01,451 --> 01:10:02,911
What you're asking...

734
01:10:02,953 --> 01:10:05,413
Is problematic to say the least.

735
01:10:06,206 --> 01:10:10,916
I didn't expect to hear a simple yes.

736
01:10:10,961 --> 01:10:14,711
But I do not want to hear a simple no.

737
01:10:14,756 --> 01:10:16,586
Is that what you are telling me?
Are you saying no?

738
01:10:16,633 --> 01:10:18,843
I'm not saying no.

739
01:10:18,886 --> 01:10:20,136
I'm saying time.

740
01:10:21,096 --> 01:10:22,596
Time.

741
01:10:22,639 --> 01:10:24,519
You're listening to hebrews.

742
01:10:24,558 --> 01:10:25,638
I'm not listening to hebrews.

743
01:10:25,976 --> 01:10:28,436
Who are you talking to?

744
01:10:29,938 --> 01:10:30,978
God.

745
01:10:35,152 --> 01:10:37,322
God.

746
01:10:37,654 --> 01:10:39,914
Which God?

747
01:11:01,053 --> 01:11:03,763
You're not seriously
considering his proposal.

748
01:11:03,805 --> 01:11:05,465
Is it a proposal?

749
01:11:05,516 --> 01:11:09,386
If a man is holding a dagger
to your throat, minister?

750
01:11:09,436 --> 01:11:10,846
-Is it?
-I stand corrected.

751
01:11:11,355 --> 01:11:13,025
That's a demand.

752
01:11:14,525 --> 01:11:16,405
He has lost his mind.

753
01:11:16,443 --> 01:11:19,533
He's found a God. His God.

754
01:11:20,364 --> 01:11:22,664
Not one of ours...

755
01:11:23,367 --> 01:11:26,537
So I would like Moses...

756
01:11:30,332 --> 01:11:32,042
I want Moses dead.

757
01:11:35,212 --> 01:11:36,382
Did you hear me?

758
01:11:37,214 --> 01:11:38,344
Yes.

759
01:11:38,382 --> 01:11:40,302
Then, go.

760
01:11:42,678 --> 01:11:43,548
And...

761
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,060
His family, too.

762
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:01,530
Moses.

763
01:12:01,572 --> 01:12:02,702
Where's Moses?

764
01:12:08,829 --> 01:12:11,369
Moses? Where's Moses?

765
01:12:53,624 --> 01:12:54,624
Moses...

766
01:12:55,125 --> 01:12:56,415
His family.

767
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:58,800
Where are they?

768
01:13:21,068 --> 01:13:24,068
This is not Moses.

769
01:13:26,156 --> 01:13:29,076
This is not his family.

770
01:13:31,286 --> 01:13:33,456
This is a man...

771
01:13:33,497 --> 01:13:35,457
His wife...

772
01:13:35,499 --> 01:13:37,579
And his child...

773
01:13:37,626 --> 01:13:41,796
Who when asked the simple question,
"where is he?"...

774
01:13:41,839 --> 01:13:45,629
Answered, "we don't know."

775
01:13:57,688 --> 01:14:01,148
Carry this image home with you tonight...

776
01:14:01,191 --> 01:14:03,611
And discuss why you would protect him...

777
01:14:04,069 --> 01:14:07,609
Knowing that tomorrow at this time...

778
01:14:07,656 --> 01:14:10,576
There will be another family...

779
01:14:10,617 --> 01:14:12,987
Where this one is.

780
01:14:13,036 --> 01:14:15,366
And another the day after.

781
01:14:15,414 --> 01:14:18,334
And the day after that.

782
01:14:19,751 --> 01:14:22,841
Dare I say yours?

783
01:14:35,809 --> 01:14:37,019
Go ahead.

784
01:14:39,146 --> 01:14:40,606
I want to join the fight.

785
01:14:40,647 --> 01:14:41,557
In there.

786
01:14:49,156 --> 01:14:51,066
Joshua, use your knee.

787
01:15:00,334 --> 01:15:01,334
It's good.

788
01:15:26,318 --> 01:15:28,148
Both eyes open!

789
01:15:28,195 --> 01:15:30,365
Nock! Draw!

790
01:15:31,114 --> 01:15:31,874
Loose!

791
01:15:32,658 --> 01:15:34,198
Advance.

792
01:15:34,243 --> 01:15:35,703
Nock. Draw.

793
01:15:36,578 --> 01:15:37,578
Loose!

794
01:15:38,247 --> 01:15:38,907
Draw!

795
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,165
Loose!

796
01:15:42,417 --> 01:15:43,127
Draw!

797
01:15:44,044 --> 01:15:44,884
Loose!

798
01:15:52,427 --> 01:15:53,347
Again!

799
01:16:00,143 --> 01:16:01,523
There are two kinds of warfare.

800
01:16:02,813 --> 01:16:04,813
Each is dictated by numbers.

801
01:16:05,482 --> 01:16:07,362
With greater numbers...

802
01:16:07,693 --> 01:16:10,033
You attack the enemy head on!

803
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:13,160
You stab it in the heart!

804
01:16:13,824 --> 01:16:16,204
With fewer numbers,
you come at it from the side.

805
01:16:16,243 --> 01:16:19,203
You cut off the blood...

806
01:16:20,163 --> 01:16:21,163
That pumps the heart.

807
01:16:22,708 --> 01:16:24,498
The army supply lines.

808
01:16:24,543 --> 01:16:25,753
No!

809
01:16:26,253 --> 01:16:27,963
The people's supply lines.

810
01:16:28,005 --> 01:16:29,305
Their food...

811
01:16:29,339 --> 01:16:30,969
Their property...

812
01:16:31,008 --> 01:16:32,798
Their comfort.

813
01:16:32,843 --> 01:16:34,093
What would that achieve?

814
01:16:34,553 --> 01:16:35,853
Everything.

815
01:16:35,888 --> 01:16:38,138
Only the Egyptian people...

816
01:16:38,182 --> 01:16:41,182
Can force him
to accept our demands...

817
01:16:41,226 --> 01:16:44,186
For freedom. We must force them...

818
01:16:44,605 --> 01:16:46,945
To make him say yes!

819
01:16:47,691 --> 01:16:48,531
Yes?

820
01:16:48,567 --> 01:16:49,857
Yes!

821
01:16:50,194 --> 01:16:50,994
Yes?

822
01:16:51,028 --> 01:16:52,528
Yes!

823
01:18:19,032 --> 01:18:19,872
With me!

824
01:18:20,951 --> 01:18:22,291
With me!

825
01:18:22,327 --> 01:18:23,117
Ready.

826
01:18:52,316 --> 01:18:54,896
You're not going to do anything?

827
01:18:56,737 --> 01:18:59,067
I didn't say that.

828
01:20:12,896 --> 01:20:14,686
Where have you been?

829
01:20:14,731 --> 01:20:16,071
Watching you fail.

830
01:20:16,567 --> 01:20:18,737
Wars of attrition take time.

831
01:20:19,236 --> 01:20:21,356
At this rate, you'll take years...

832
01:20:21,405 --> 01:20:22,915
A generation.

833
01:20:23,615 --> 01:20:25,735
I am prepared to fight for that long.

834
01:20:26,118 --> 01:20:27,618
I'm not.

835
01:20:28,245 --> 01:20:29,415
I thought we were making progress.

836
01:20:32,583 --> 01:20:34,583
Now, you're impatient.

837
01:20:35,127 --> 01:20:39,507
After 400 years of slavery.

838
01:20:41,091 --> 01:20:45,261
Am I the only one sitting here
who's done nothing about this until now?

839
01:20:46,096 --> 01:20:47,466
I do know...

840
01:20:47,514 --> 01:20:50,024
A few things about military action.

841
01:20:50,058 --> 01:20:51,888
Still, if you're not going
to listen to me...

842
01:20:51,935 --> 01:20:53,395
Then why did you take me away...

843
01:20:53,437 --> 01:20:54,937
From my family?

844
01:20:55,939 --> 01:20:57,439
I didn't.

845
01:20:57,941 --> 01:20:59,531
You did.

846
01:20:59,568 --> 01:21:01,608
You don't need me.

847
01:21:02,279 --> 01:21:03,779
Maybe not.

848
01:21:06,533 --> 01:21:08,123
So what do I do? Nothing?

849
01:21:08,952 --> 01:21:10,292
For now...

850
01:21:11,538 --> 01:21:13,248
You can watch.

851
01:22:54,391 --> 01:22:57,641
Divine goddess kebechet,
I humbly call upon you...

852
01:22:57,686 --> 01:23:00,266
To purify the waters
of our life-giving river.

853
01:23:16,079 --> 01:23:17,959
How long will it take?

854
01:23:18,749 --> 01:23:20,579
Not long.

855
01:23:25,589 --> 01:23:26,759
But longer than that.

856
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,650
Ramses! Ramses!

857
01:25:05,022 --> 01:25:06,022
Yes?

858
01:25:09,651 --> 01:25:10,991
Enough!

859
01:25:11,028 --> 01:25:12,648
Do something!

860
01:25:12,696 --> 01:25:15,026
They're just frogs.

861
01:25:24,708 --> 01:25:26,708
Back away, back away.

862
01:25:26,752 --> 01:25:28,042
Unclean.

863
01:25:28,086 --> 01:25:29,546
No, no, no. Don't drink.

864
01:25:29,588 --> 01:25:30,548
Unclean.

865
01:26:02,287 --> 01:26:06,707
The nile, as we know,
carries a certain amount of Clay.

866
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:09,210
This year there's much more of it
than usual...

867
01:26:09,253 --> 01:26:11,713
Drifting in on the currents,
settling on the riverbeds...

868
01:26:11,755 --> 01:26:15,465
And kicked up by the wild thrashing
of the crocodiles.

869
01:26:15,509 --> 01:26:17,889
This thrashing not only...

870
01:26:17,928 --> 01:26:21,468
Dramatically changed the color of the water,
but it fouled it...

871
01:26:21,515 --> 01:26:23,565
To the point of killing the fish.

872
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,890
But frogs, as we know...

873
01:26:25,936 --> 01:26:29,106
Can get out of the water,
when they have to.

874
01:26:29,147 --> 01:26:30,897
Which they did.

875
01:26:30,941 --> 01:26:33,651
But frogs still need water...

876
01:26:33,694 --> 01:26:36,454
And when they can't find it
in the streets of our city...

877
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:38,620
They what?

878
01:26:40,033 --> 01:26:41,243
They die?

879
01:26:41,285 --> 01:26:42,625
They die!

880
01:26:43,787 --> 01:26:44,787
And then they decompose.

881
01:26:45,455 --> 01:26:48,455
And then the gnats come
and the maggots come and the flies come.

882
01:26:49,459 --> 01:26:51,459
And then...

883
01:26:53,881 --> 01:26:55,471
And then what?

884
01:26:57,801 --> 01:26:58,841
The flies die.

885
01:27:43,388 --> 01:27:44,218
Speak up.

886
01:27:44,264 --> 01:27:46,024
It's in Hebrew.

887
01:27:46,517 --> 01:27:48,227
Hebrew?

888
01:27:48,268 --> 01:27:49,518
Read it.

889
01:27:49,561 --> 01:27:50,901
"These catastrophes...

890
01:27:51,396 --> 01:27:52,896
"Are the work of God...

891
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:55,360
"And they have not finished.
They will get worse.

892
01:27:56,235 --> 01:27:58,195
"We need to reach a settlement...

893
01:27:58,237 --> 01:27:59,817
"For both our sakes."

894
01:28:02,533 --> 01:28:04,583
So, the work of God.

895
01:28:08,789 --> 01:28:12,129
Here is my settlement to you.

896
01:28:12,501 --> 01:28:14,881
Work quotas shall be doubled...

897
01:28:15,337 --> 01:28:17,507
And you will get no straw...

898
01:28:17,548 --> 01:28:19,298
To make your bricks.

899
01:28:20,217 --> 01:28:21,627
Perhaps your God...

900
01:28:21,677 --> 01:28:24,047
Will provide it for you.

901
01:28:52,124 --> 01:28:54,754
I was impressed at first.

902
01:28:55,252 --> 01:28:57,212
Not anymore.

903
01:28:58,922 --> 01:29:00,672
This is affecting everyone.

904
01:29:02,551 --> 01:29:04,841
So, who are you punishing?

905
01:29:20,569 --> 01:29:21,439
What's wrong with him?

906
01:29:25,908 --> 01:29:27,328
It's sick.

907
01:29:33,916 --> 01:29:35,956
What is this?

908
01:29:36,001 --> 01:29:37,961
-Did you do this?
-Not me.

909
01:29:38,003 --> 01:29:39,173
-Is this you?
-No, no!

910
01:29:41,381 --> 01:29:42,551
What's happened to him?

911
01:30:15,249 --> 01:30:18,379
We have made great strides in medicine.

912
01:30:18,418 --> 01:30:21,668
However, there are still a few hidden diseases
that we don't completely understand.

913
01:30:22,756 --> 01:30:24,916
Animals are not exempt...

914
01:30:24,967 --> 01:30:27,547
And there is some conjecture...

915
01:30:27,594 --> 01:30:31,894
That these maladies can migrate
from the smallest creature.

916
01:30:31,932 --> 01:30:32,892
Like a...

917
01:30:33,934 --> 01:30:35,194
A fly.

918
01:30:43,026 --> 01:30:44,686
Have you been out to the river lately?

919
01:30:44,736 --> 01:30:46,356
I appealed to kebechet again...

920
01:30:47,072 --> 01:30:49,202
And six more gods.

921
01:31:59,770 --> 01:32:01,730
Is that it?

922
01:32:04,149 --> 01:32:05,729
Are you done?

923
01:32:11,365 --> 01:32:12,955
I am.

924
01:32:23,502 --> 01:32:26,592
Are you trying to say something
with your absence?

925
01:32:29,091 --> 01:32:31,341
Is it meant to humble me?

926
01:32:31,385 --> 01:32:33,645
Because it will not!

927
01:33:40,370 --> 01:33:42,330
Initial reports suggest...

928
01:33:42,372 --> 01:33:45,882
More than 10 million square cubits
of crops have been lost.

929
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:49,750
The quartermaster has suggested
we return a portion...

930
01:33:49,796 --> 01:33:52,046
Of the supplement to the civil granary.

931
01:33:52,883 --> 01:33:55,223
An act of mercy.

932
01:33:56,136 --> 01:33:57,636
Your people are starving.

933
01:33:58,764 --> 01:34:01,734
Are you suggesting
that I should starve, too?

934
01:34:02,392 --> 01:34:03,392
No.

935
01:34:05,604 --> 01:34:08,154
People have plenty of water.

936
01:34:09,066 --> 01:34:10,566
They will endure.

937
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:48,980
Aim!

938
01:34:50,232 --> 01:34:50,982
Fire!

939
01:34:56,113 --> 01:34:56,913
Aim!

940
01:34:57,656 --> 01:34:58,446
Fire!

941
01:35:52,711 --> 01:35:55,131
Is that you?

942
01:35:56,381 --> 01:35:57,841
Moses?

943
01:35:59,343 --> 01:36:01,183
Brother?

944
01:36:06,141 --> 01:36:08,521
Have you come to negotiate?

945
01:36:11,396 --> 01:36:12,856
Because I'm ready...

946
01:36:14,024 --> 01:36:16,364
As I have an offer for you.

947
01:36:17,861 --> 01:36:20,241
One more thing happens...

948
01:36:21,532 --> 01:36:25,492
And I will bring my own plague to you.

949
01:36:27,371 --> 01:36:30,121
You see, every Hebrew child...

950
01:36:30,165 --> 01:36:32,035
Not yet walking...

951
01:36:33,001 --> 01:36:34,291
They never shall.

952
01:36:35,379 --> 01:36:38,799
Because I will drown them in the nile.

953
01:36:40,050 --> 01:36:42,180
As you should have been.

954
01:36:44,888 --> 01:36:49,178
You say that you didn't cause all this?

955
01:36:50,561 --> 01:36:52,901
Your God did?

956
01:36:54,857 --> 01:36:58,187
I am the God! I am the God!

957
01:37:02,656 --> 01:37:06,576
So, let's just see
who's more effective at killing.

958
01:37:07,828 --> 01:37:09,538
You.

959
01:37:09,872 --> 01:37:11,332
This God.

960
01:37:13,584 --> 01:37:14,924
Or me.

961
01:37:36,231 --> 01:37:37,941
Nice of you to come.

962
01:37:39,109 --> 01:37:41,359
He's given you what you asked?

963
01:37:45,282 --> 01:37:47,992
Not yet. But his own people
are turning against him.

964
01:37:48,035 --> 01:37:50,165
-And his army?
-It will.

965
01:37:50,204 --> 01:37:51,914
I disagree.

966
01:37:52,789 --> 01:37:54,579
Something worse has to happen.

967
01:37:54,625 --> 01:37:55,925
I disagree.

968
01:37:56,251 --> 01:37:59,501
-Anything more would be...
-Would be what?

969
01:37:59,546 --> 01:38:00,626
What were you about to say?

970
01:38:01,256 --> 01:38:03,256
Cruel? Inhumane?

971
01:38:03,592 --> 01:38:06,342
It's not easy to see...

972
01:38:06,386 --> 01:38:09,306
The people who I grew up with
suffering this much.

973
01:38:09,598 --> 01:38:11,558
What about the people you
didn't grow up with?

974
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:12,980
What thought did you give to them?

975
01:38:15,145 --> 01:38:17,725
You still don't think of them
as yours, do you?

976
01:38:19,483 --> 01:38:20,823
As long as ramses
has an army behind him...

977
01:38:21,318 --> 01:38:22,858
Nothing will change.

978
01:38:22,903 --> 01:38:24,613
Anything more is just revenge!

979
01:38:24,655 --> 01:38:27,665
Revenge?
After 400 years of brutal subjugation?

980
01:38:29,493 --> 01:38:34,123
These pharaohs who imagine they're living gods,
they're nothing more than flesh and blood.

981
01:38:34,164 --> 01:38:38,294
I want to see them on their knees,
begging for it to stop!

982
01:38:38,335 --> 01:38:40,835
I'm tired of talking with a messenger!

983
01:38:44,675 --> 01:38:46,095
General!

984
01:38:47,427 --> 01:38:51,137
I have heard ramses' final threat.

985
01:38:51,181 --> 01:38:53,481
So, let me tell you
what's going to happen next.

986
01:38:56,687 --> 01:38:57,937
No. No.

987
01:38:58,438 --> 01:39:00,358
You cannot do this.

988
01:39:00,649 --> 01:39:02,689
I want no part of this!

989
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:29,590
Stay!

990
01:39:30,721 --> 01:39:32,061
-Hold!
-Moses?

991
01:39:35,225 --> 01:39:36,265
Leave him.

992
01:39:43,358 --> 01:39:46,068
-Khyan.
-Moses.

993
01:40:01,710 --> 01:40:03,210
I could have you killed.

994
01:40:03,879 --> 01:40:05,759
I don't think so.

995
01:40:07,132 --> 01:40:09,262
Unless you do it yourself.

996
01:40:09,718 --> 01:40:12,298
Your own soldiers let me in.

997
01:40:16,558 --> 01:40:18,848
I am not negotiating anymore.

998
01:40:18,894 --> 01:40:21,274
That's not why I'm here.

999
01:40:22,439 --> 01:40:26,609
I came to tell you
that something is coming...

1000
01:40:26,944 --> 01:40:29,744
That is out of my control.

1001
01:40:29,780 --> 01:40:32,910
Something that will affect thousands...

1002
01:40:32,950 --> 01:40:34,280
And thousands of citizens.

1003
01:40:34,326 --> 01:40:39,156
And it will affect you very personally
unless you accept what I've asked for...

1004
01:40:39,831 --> 01:40:42,461
And announce it publicly...

1005
01:40:42,501 --> 01:40:46,341
Before the sun goes down.

1006
01:40:48,966 --> 01:40:50,176
Ramses...

1007
01:40:50,217 --> 01:40:53,637
Do not turn your back on me!

1008
01:40:56,223 --> 01:41:00,693
This has nothing to do with you and I.

1009
01:41:01,144 --> 01:41:04,364
This is far beyond that.

1010
01:41:04,648 --> 01:41:07,358
This is about Egypt's survival.
Do you understand?

1011
01:41:13,532 --> 01:41:14,992
Sunset.

1012
01:41:16,493 --> 01:41:18,543
After that, it will be too late.

1013
01:41:19,329 --> 01:41:21,119
What will be too late?

1014
01:41:21,164 --> 01:41:23,384
You protect your child.

1015
01:41:24,168 --> 01:41:26,498
You protect your child tonight.

1016
01:41:27,212 --> 01:41:28,842
My child?

1017
01:41:30,716 --> 01:41:32,256
Is that a threat?

1018
01:41:37,014 --> 01:41:39,854
Is that a threat? Moses!

1019
01:41:40,851 --> 01:41:42,101
Moses!

1020
01:41:45,689 --> 01:41:47,109
Tell everyone...

1021
01:41:48,275 --> 01:41:50,365
To slaughter a lamb...

1022
01:41:51,028 --> 01:41:52,528
And mark their doors...

1023
01:41:53,113 --> 01:41:55,203
And their doorposts tonight...

1024
01:41:55,782 --> 01:41:57,032
With its blood.

1025
01:41:59,244 --> 01:42:00,294
Why?

1026
01:42:00,787 --> 01:42:04,037
Pity the lambs if I am wrong.

1027
01:42:06,418 --> 01:42:08,668
If I'm right...

1028
01:42:08,712 --> 01:42:11,592
We will bless them for eternity.

1029
01:44:30,521 --> 01:44:33,231
Bennu? Bennu?

1030
01:45:24,408 --> 01:45:26,408
No!

1031
01:45:29,204 --> 01:45:30,414
Ramses?

1032
01:45:31,957 --> 01:45:33,457
Ramses.

1033
01:45:36,628 --> 01:45:38,088
Ramses.

1034
01:45:55,564 --> 01:45:56,944
No!

1035
01:46:02,321 --> 01:46:03,781
Zechariah?

1036
01:46:10,287 --> 01:46:11,957
Zechariah?

1037
01:46:51,787 --> 01:46:53,157
Kneel!

1038
01:47:12,182 --> 01:47:13,392
Get out!

1039
01:47:14,351 --> 01:47:15,771
Murderer!

1040
01:47:16,854 --> 01:47:18,444
Child killer!

1041
01:47:29,449 --> 01:47:32,869
Their children died last night.

1042
01:47:34,663 --> 01:47:35,873
As did mine.

1043
01:47:40,711 --> 01:47:42,841
Is this your God?

1044
01:47:45,549 --> 01:47:47,879
A killer of children?

1045
01:47:48,635 --> 01:47:52,385
What kind of fanatics
worship such a God?

1046
01:47:59,897 --> 01:48:02,227
No Hebrew child died last night.

1047
01:48:22,753 --> 01:48:23,843
Get...

1048
01:48:24,755 --> 01:48:25,765
Out.

1049
01:48:27,090 --> 01:48:28,720
Go.

1050
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:31,720
Every one of you!

1051
01:48:32,221 --> 01:48:33,261
Go!

1052
01:48:36,350 --> 01:48:37,930
Go to canaan if that's what you want.

1053
01:48:39,186 --> 01:48:41,856
Back to the homeland of your dreams.

1054
01:48:42,773 --> 01:48:44,443
But go!

1055
01:48:48,070 --> 01:48:49,860
As you command.

1056
01:49:01,834 --> 01:49:04,504
This is the route I took.

1057
01:49:04,545 --> 01:49:07,385
From here, we go South to the red sea.

1058
01:49:07,422 --> 01:49:10,012
The straits are here.
At low tide, we can cross on foot.

1059
01:50:48,732 --> 01:50:51,692
You know why you sleep so well, my boy?

1060
01:50:53,946 --> 01:50:56,406
Because you know you are loved.

1061
01:51:48,792 --> 01:51:50,252
With respect...

1062
01:51:50,294 --> 01:51:53,054
If we're going to
recapture 400,000 slaves...

1063
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:55,758
We might need more than three divisions.

1064
01:51:56,216 --> 01:51:58,296
We're not recapturing anyone.

1065
01:52:02,055 --> 01:52:03,345
Forward!

1066
01:52:42,179 --> 01:52:43,679
We should rest.

1067
01:52:43,722 --> 01:52:44,972
No.

1068
01:52:45,015 --> 01:52:48,135
We're not safe until we cross the sea.

1069
01:52:51,230 --> 01:52:52,360
Moshe!

1070
01:52:56,735 --> 01:52:58,395
Ramses...

1071
01:52:58,445 --> 01:52:59,525
4,000 men...

1072
01:52:59,947 --> 01:53:01,157
A thousand chariots.

1073
01:53:01,198 --> 01:53:02,488
How far behind us?

1074
01:53:02,950 --> 01:53:04,330
Four days.

1075
01:53:04,368 --> 01:53:06,288
Less, if they don't rest the horses.

1076
01:53:13,961 --> 01:53:15,091
Ramses!

1077
01:53:15,838 --> 01:53:17,378
Ramses!

1078
01:53:18,048 --> 01:53:19,918
We need to rest the horses...

1079
01:53:19,967 --> 01:53:21,507
And the men!

1080
01:53:33,856 --> 01:53:35,436
The straits are that way.

1081
01:53:35,482 --> 01:53:38,362
The longest, easiest route...

1082
01:53:38,402 --> 01:53:41,032
Is down the Western coast.

1083
01:53:42,573 --> 01:53:46,333
Or we go through the mountains.

1084
01:53:47,911 --> 01:53:49,251
The mountains?

1085
01:53:49,288 --> 01:53:52,868
Why? Why don't we take that route?

1086
01:53:52,916 --> 01:53:54,416
We can, but so can ramses.

1087
01:53:56,295 --> 01:53:58,385
The Mountain passes are dangerous...

1088
01:53:58,422 --> 01:54:01,842
But they are too narrow
for ramses' chariots.

1089
01:54:01,884 --> 01:54:04,514
He couldn't follow.
That would give us needed time.

1090
01:54:06,138 --> 01:54:07,598
What does God tell you?

1091
01:54:13,812 --> 01:54:15,232
The mountains.

1092
01:54:16,315 --> 01:54:18,575
Can we make it?

1093
01:54:24,615 --> 01:54:26,075
Forward!

1094
01:55:07,157 --> 01:55:08,907
Which way from here?

1095
01:55:12,454 --> 01:55:13,714
Stay here.

1096
01:55:33,976 --> 01:55:36,806
We need your help.

1097
01:55:44,444 --> 01:55:46,614
I don't know where I am.

1098
01:56:10,721 --> 01:56:12,721
You won't help me?

1099
01:56:15,267 --> 01:56:17,637
You won't help them.

1100
01:56:22,232 --> 01:56:23,822
This way!

1101
01:56:27,529 --> 01:56:29,409
Move out!

1102
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:49,880
This way!

1103
01:56:52,221 --> 01:56:53,431
Are you sure?

1104
01:56:54,097 --> 01:56:56,217
I'm very sure.

1105
01:56:56,266 --> 01:56:58,886
I mean, are you sure we can make it
across with our equipment...

1106
01:56:58,936 --> 01:57:00,516
Our chariots?

1107
01:57:00,979 --> 01:57:02,059
They didn't think they could
with theirs.

1108
01:57:04,775 --> 01:57:06,325
How would they know?

1109
01:57:07,152 --> 01:57:08,572
They've never been here.

1110
01:57:09,112 --> 01:57:10,162
Moses may have.

1111
01:57:52,364 --> 01:57:54,074
Is this high tide or low tide?

1112
01:57:54,116 --> 01:57:55,696
Doesn't matter.

1113
01:57:57,119 --> 01:57:58,749
This isn't the straits, is it?

1114
01:57:58,787 --> 01:57:59,787
No.

1115
01:58:03,083 --> 01:58:04,423
Do you even know where we are?

1116
01:58:04,668 --> 01:58:06,168
Yes!

1117
01:58:06,211 --> 01:58:09,511
We're at a point on the earth
where there is a sea ahead...

1118
01:58:09,548 --> 01:58:11,298
And an army behind!

1119
01:58:11,341 --> 01:58:13,221
So now what?

1120
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:14,300
Army or no army...

1121
01:58:14,344 --> 01:58:16,224
We have to rest.

1122
01:58:40,996 --> 01:58:43,116
I have misled all of them.

1123
01:58:44,833 --> 01:58:47,753
I have abandoned my family.

1124
01:58:49,254 --> 01:58:50,924
I have failed you.

1125
01:58:56,345 --> 01:58:59,015
I'm not what I thought I was.

1126
02:01:55,107 --> 02:01:56,227
What is it?

1127
02:01:57,734 --> 02:01:59,404
The current.

1128
02:02:02,656 --> 02:02:04,196
It's strong.

1129
02:02:12,541 --> 02:02:13,751
We need to cross here.

1130
02:02:17,421 --> 02:02:19,421
We need to cross now!

1131
02:02:23,385 --> 02:02:25,175
We cross here.

1132
02:02:25,220 --> 02:02:26,550
We cross here!

1133
02:02:27,848 --> 02:02:29,468
Ready yourselves!

1134
02:02:29,516 --> 02:02:30,636
We cross here!

1135
02:02:31,226 --> 02:02:33,596
Go tell them! Go!

1136
02:02:33,645 --> 02:02:34,725
Your orders...

1137
02:02:34,771 --> 02:02:37,691
Are like the lash of the Egyptian whip.

1138
02:02:39,276 --> 02:02:41,106
We are no longer slaves.

1139
02:02:41,695 --> 02:02:43,525
And yet, you are not free.

1140
02:02:45,073 --> 02:02:45,913
You have lost sight...

1141
02:02:46,950 --> 02:02:47,990
Of canaan...

1142
02:02:48,869 --> 02:02:50,909
Land of your forebears.

1143
02:02:52,998 --> 02:02:54,578
You have honored me...

1144
02:02:55,375 --> 02:02:57,125
With your trust.

1145
02:02:57,961 --> 02:03:01,091
Now I honor you with my faith.

1146
02:03:02,966 --> 02:03:06,006
Follow me and you will be free!

1147
02:03:06,386 --> 02:03:09,096
Stay and you will perish.

1148
02:03:11,642 --> 02:03:13,352
Do not be afraid!

1149
02:03:14,853 --> 02:03:16,563
God is with us!

1150
02:03:16,605 --> 02:03:18,825
Go! Ready yourselves!

1151
02:03:19,691 --> 02:03:20,731
Go!

1152
02:03:20,776 --> 02:03:22,526
God is with us!

1153
02:03:22,569 --> 02:03:26,609
Pass the word! We cross here!

1154
02:03:27,115 --> 02:03:29,235
As quickly as you can,
gather your things...

1155
02:03:29,868 --> 02:03:31,238
And form in groups!

1156
02:03:35,332 --> 02:03:36,832
Quickly!

1157
02:03:44,341 --> 02:03:46,511
Come on!

1158
02:04:35,517 --> 02:04:36,517
Steady!

1159
02:04:42,149 --> 02:04:44,689
To the right, to the right! Tight!

1160
02:05:10,844 --> 02:05:12,804
Keep moving!

1161
02:05:13,805 --> 02:05:15,885
There's nothing to fear!

1162
02:05:18,810 --> 02:05:20,940
Don't worry! You'll be safe!

1163
02:05:43,669 --> 02:05:46,629
Keep to the right! Keep to the right!

1164
02:05:50,968 --> 02:05:52,428
Ramses!

1165
02:06:26,336 --> 02:06:27,246
Stop!

1166
02:06:50,277 --> 02:06:53,107
Stop! Stop!

1167
02:07:11,632 --> 02:07:13,092
Go.

1168
02:07:15,594 --> 02:07:16,724
Keep moving!

1169
02:07:17,387 --> 02:07:19,677
Keep moving! Forward!

1170
02:07:49,169 --> 02:07:50,089
There.

1171
02:08:12,192 --> 02:08:13,192
Joshua!

1172
02:08:14,111 --> 02:08:15,201
Aaron!

1173
02:08:30,294 --> 02:08:31,884
Run!

1174
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:33,210
Everyone, run!

1175
02:08:33,589 --> 02:08:34,839
Move!

1176
02:08:34,882 --> 02:08:36,382
Run to shore!

1177
02:09:23,764 --> 02:09:24,684
Moshe.

1178
02:10:27,244 --> 02:10:28,414
Moshe.

1179
02:10:32,749 --> 02:10:33,669
We must leave!

1180
02:10:38,338 --> 02:10:39,048
Ramses!

1181
02:10:39,423 --> 02:10:41,093
Ramses!

1182
02:10:46,388 --> 02:10:47,428
Go!

1183
02:10:47,681 --> 02:10:49,101
Ramses, stop!

1184
02:10:56,815 --> 02:11:00,105
All! Turn around!

1185
02:11:00,152 --> 02:11:02,902
Turn around!

1186
02:11:02,946 --> 02:11:04,856
Khyan!

1187
02:11:11,663 --> 02:11:13,083
Leave.

1188
02:11:13,457 --> 02:11:14,367
Brother...

1189
02:11:14,416 --> 02:11:16,326
Leave now! That's an order!

1190
02:11:41,818 --> 02:11:44,488
Come! You'll never make it back!

1191
02:12:03,340 --> 02:12:04,550
Go!

1192
02:12:11,181 --> 02:12:12,891
Faster!

1193
02:14:33,407 --> 02:14:34,777
It's just me here.

1194
02:14:43,167 --> 02:14:44,827
Sit.

1195
02:14:51,091 --> 02:14:53,721
My family...

1196
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:55,300
Is not far from here.

1197
02:14:55,345 --> 02:14:56,295
Your family?

1198
02:14:56,346 --> 02:14:58,846
My other family. My wife, my son.

1199
02:15:00,350 --> 02:15:02,270
I was thinking...

1200
02:15:02,311 --> 02:15:04,771
Maybe I could convince them...

1201
02:15:05,522 --> 02:15:08,192
Convince them to join us,
but perhaps that's...

1202
02:15:09,735 --> 02:15:10,945
Perhaps that's not wise.

1203
02:15:10,986 --> 02:15:13,026
Of course they should come.

1204
02:15:13,071 --> 02:15:14,531
We have a long way to go.

1205
02:15:14,948 --> 02:15:16,618
A lot can happen.

1206
02:15:17,117 --> 02:15:18,617
And then...

1207
02:15:19,203 --> 02:15:21,453
We get there, if we get there.

1208
02:15:21,496 --> 02:15:23,366
You don't think they'll
let us settle in canaan?

1209
02:15:24,166 --> 02:15:26,376
They'll see us as invaders.

1210
02:15:26,919 --> 02:15:30,419
They won't have a choice.
We're as big as any tribe.

1211
02:15:30,464 --> 02:15:32,924
We're as big as a nation of tribes
and that concerns me even more.

1212
02:15:33,425 --> 02:15:34,755
Why?

1213
02:15:35,969 --> 02:15:38,429
This many people?

1214
02:15:38,472 --> 02:15:40,522
You have to ask?

1215
02:15:43,143 --> 02:15:44,943
But we all have the same goal.

1216
02:15:44,978 --> 02:15:46,018
We do now.

1217
02:15:47,272 --> 02:15:49,522
What happens when we stop running?

1218
02:16:14,216 --> 02:16:15,626
Ramses...

1219
02:16:17,177 --> 02:16:19,217
The great.

1220
02:16:28,605 --> 02:16:30,395
Thank you.

1221
02:16:56,049 --> 02:16:57,219
Gershom.

1222
02:17:48,685 --> 02:17:50,935
Did you do what you said?

1223
02:17:51,939 --> 02:17:54,019
What did I say?

1224
02:17:55,234 --> 02:17:58,034
That you would trade your faith...

1225
02:17:59,571 --> 02:18:01,031
To keep me.

1226
02:18:02,032 --> 02:18:03,532
No.

1227
02:18:06,119 --> 02:18:08,199
Good.

1228
02:18:08,247 --> 02:18:11,287
You may need it more than ever now.

1229
02:18:23,929 --> 02:18:26,219
Who are they?

1230
02:18:27,558 --> 02:18:30,058
They're my people.

1231
02:18:37,568 --> 02:18:39,898
Who makes you happy?

1232
02:18:42,239 --> 02:18:43,319
You do.

1233
02:18:44,449 --> 02:18:47,659
What is the most important thing
in your life?

1234
02:18:49,329 --> 02:18:50,409
You are.

1235
02:18:50,956 --> 02:18:52,616
You are.

1236
02:18:56,628 --> 02:18:58,418
When will I leave you?

1237
02:19:01,508 --> 02:19:02,758
Never.

1238
02:19:07,264 --> 02:19:09,024
May I proceed?

1239
02:19:11,602 --> 02:19:13,692
Proceed.

1240
02:20:37,521 --> 02:20:39,111
What do you think of this?

1241
02:20:40,691 --> 02:20:42,651
I wouldn't do it...

1242
02:20:42,693 --> 02:20:44,283
If I didn't agree.

1243
02:20:46,196 --> 02:20:47,946
That's true.

1244
02:20:48,615 --> 02:20:50,575
I've noticed that about you.

1245
02:20:51,535 --> 02:20:53,955
You don't always agree with me.

1246
02:20:54,746 --> 02:20:58,036
Nor you me, I've noticed.

1247
02:20:58,542 --> 02:21:01,962
Yet here we are, still speaking.

1248
02:21:02,254 --> 02:21:04,384
But not for much longer.

1249
02:21:08,218 --> 02:21:10,098
A leader can falter...

1250
02:21:10,137 --> 02:21:11,547
But stone...

1251
02:21:12,431 --> 02:21:14,431
Will endure.

1252
02:21:15,058 --> 02:21:17,228
These laws will guide them
in your stead.

1253
02:21:20,105 --> 02:21:21,645
If you disagree...

1254
02:21:22,232 --> 02:21:24,612
You should put down the hammer.
